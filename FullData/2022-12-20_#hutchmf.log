[2022-12-20 18:51:47] <SirSmokin> Respiratory syncytial (sin-SISH-uhl) virus, or RSV, is a common respiratory virus that usually causes mild, cold-like symptoms. Most people recover in a week or two, but RSV can be serious, especially for infants and older adults. RSV is the most common cause of bronchiolitis (inflammation of the small airways in the lung) and pneumonia (infection of the lungs) in children younger than 1 year of age in the United States.
[2022-12-20 18:51:49] <weesledun> yep
[2022-12-20 18:51:52] <%DaBiirdman> Rsv is Respiratory syncytial virus

[2022-12-20 18:51:53] <+SlimeBucket_> yeah
[2022-12-20 18:51:54] <FoomDog> RSV can act like a cold, if gets bad acts like pneumonia, and lung infection.

[2022-12-20 20:28:56] <sleeperG> How about the clean manor ? @HutchMF
[2022-12-20 20:29:05] <mykn1f3urf4c387> the ultimate way to fix this is go on a crime strike how boring would that be for cops.

[2022-12-20 20:29:12] <%+Deadlyshot16> @raahzi Thats a valid point since their rolling up on gang turf
[2022-12-20 20:29:14] <+Ryeman11> i want to see a riot!!!!!!!!!!

[2022-12-20 20:29:21] <axolotls102> no at the end of the day its night
[2022-12-20 20:29:24] <+gnxrs> there might be a cop limit
[2022-12-20 20:29:39] <MrShad0w818_> cg gate gone?
[2022-12-20 20:29:46] <@%+Yawger> thats not true... as many of them can ONLY be cop... due to prio issues.
[2022-12-20 20:29:48] <%d3ltaf0x> Time to have a Gang Leaders meeting?
[2022-12-20 20:29:53] <memesiss> so did manor get messed with?

[2022-12-20 20:29:58] <%+Temeter131> i wonder if the lost has a gate still
[2022-12-20 20:30:04] <+TECHrp_> Cops need a win from time to time. They weren‚Äôt winning in the CG compound
[2022-12-20 20:30:07] <%+VoltiacScopez> you just cant
[2022-12-20 20:30:08] <fcooper3043> Wish they took it to court at least and had legislation added could have been great RP
[2022-12-20 20:30:10] <ilich024> did CB manor get their gates changed?
[2022-12-20 20:30:11] <leeroy_dankins_> get the crime strike going
[2022-12-20 20:30:16] <+dr4gori4n> doesn't the clean manner have a gate?
[2022-12-20 20:30:16] <%caponegobuckeyes> I think that they complained about when Eugene] yesterday locked himself in the garage

[2022-12-20 20:30:36] <@%+Yawger> There's suppose to be cops....

[2022-12-20 21:43:28] <%+Hylidian> like, normally the seed used for the rng might be super random, but lets say it uses current time as the "seed", seems fine right?

[2022-12-20 21:44:53] <%+Hylidian> now lets say that the server or client for gta works bases on ticks, every X milliseconds. Now the seed could always be odd, even, or a multiple of the tick size, which would generate a cycle.
