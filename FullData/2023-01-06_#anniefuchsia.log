[2023-01-06 11:43:12] <%Taylor131313> 11-13 is the range in which you can find either 5000IQ giga pumpers that can solo the key or 0IQ boosted kekegas who can't dodge a truck with a 50% chance
[2023-01-06 11:43:17] <%Taylor131313> really bad range LULE

[2023-01-06 14:14:37] <%Sne4ky79> modifiers both
[2023-01-06 14:14:40] <%+ein_sof93> i mean theyd be good as modifiers but whatever u wanna bind them as
[2023-01-06 14:14:45] <%Morgonbladet> But R1 + R2 etc is probably enough modifiers
[2023-01-06 14:14:50] <funkydunky11> Cute christmas decor, now its soon eastern
[2023-01-06 14:14:50] <%PanicRush> i mean, r1 and r2 are buttong AND modifiers, i assume those are the same

[2023-01-06 16:54:36] <%Wardrick7> it looks like you need console commands to configure controller

[2023-01-06 16:56:35] <%+ein_sof93> you gotta click play to start wow annie youve been doing it wrong this whole time :O
[2023-01-06 16:56:38] <%Geoffku> how do I open wow
[2023-01-06 16:56:44] <+waffle_makers> Best visual way to do it yes. Use the addon. But the command /console GamePadEnable 1 will enable the gamepad and it will automatically assign the keys. Then you go into the keybindings to assign the controller keys
[2023-01-06 16:56:44] <%JakeZGR> Keep in 4mins @AnnieFuchsia
[2023-01-06 16:56:44] <%+JayOkayy_> i tried this addon and i did not like it

[2023-01-06 16:57:35] <DSBT> i guess this is what people use on steamdeck
[2023-01-06 16:57:38] <+waffle_makers> if you use /console GamePadEnable 1
[2023-01-06 16:57:41] <+waffle_makers> it will
[2023-01-06 16:57:41] <DSBT> or something like this
[2023-01-06 16:57:45] <MrMcfunpants> I think you skipped over that part
[2023-01-06 16:57:46] <itsQQgaming> u have to restart for it to connect
[2023-01-06 16:57:49] <%bennet_r> you have to enable it via console.

[2023-01-06 16:57:50] <%Turbopumper> if you do the console command, you should be able to do bindings with controller
[2023-01-06 16:57:55] <%Taylor131313> Blizzard said that's the official way to enable controller support
[2023-01-06 16:57:57] <%Taylor131313> so that's how you do it
[2023-01-06 16:58:06] <%Morgonbladet> Write everything down in your own notes
[2023-01-06 16:58:06] <metalkid245> i love you annie
[2023-01-06 16:58:10] <MrMcfunpants> I saw a part where he was adding his controller
[2023-01-06 16:58:10] <%Swiggyswoo_> Why can't they just have a setting in game for it when they have a /console command anyways LUL
[2023-01-06 16:58:12] <%bennet_r> there is no other way to enable it. you have to use script
[2023-01-06 16:58:25] <+waffle_makers> if you use the console command it will automatically start working.
[2023-01-06 16:58:35] <%+ein_sof93> hes using an elite
[2023-01-06 16:58:47] <%Taylor131313> AAAA
[2023-01-06 16:58:47] <+waffle_makers> then you go into the keybinds to assign the console keys to your UI
[2023-01-06 16:58:50] <%Sne4ky79> looks simulare to diablo console ui?
[2023-01-06 16:58:54] <%Taylor131313> PEEPOBULLY AAAA
[2023-01-06 16:59:03] <%PanicRush> PEEPOBULLY AAAA
[2023-01-06 16:59:07] <+albunk> Similar to ffxiv on controller
[2023-01-06 16:59:10] <%drzaius30> PEEPOBULLY AAAA
[2023-01-06 16:59:19] <+waffle_makers> so you can assign what controller button does what
[2023-01-06 16:59:20] <%+JayOkayy_> @Sne4ky79 its more so like playing ffxiv with a controller
[2023-01-06 16:59:22] <%indiehjaerta> why do you want to use a controlleR? gonna play DH? Keepo
[2023-01-06 16:59:30] <%+ein_sof93> im gonna have to give this a go

[2023-01-06 17:00:08] <$MisterTea86> Oh interesting, so you can control the cursor with the controller
[2023-01-06 17:00:08] <%smcoffey> This works great on steam deck
[2023-01-06 17:00:26] <+Puns_for_days> i feel like wow has more abillities/moves but i use to play DCUO on ps3 so idk why it wouldnt be easy to use controller and map the abillities to it
[2023-01-06 17:00:27] <%Collnaris> how fast you want to make your cursor? Hmmm

[2023-01-06 17:01:36] <%smcoffey> @Puns_for_days you can map more functional keys within finger reach on a controller than most people with average hands on a keyboard so buttons is not an issue just preference of mouse camera vs stick camera control
[2023-01-06 17:01:40] <+waffle_makers> use /console GamePadEnable 1
[2023-01-06 17:01:42] <%Mirkooo> I assume same script but with a 0?

[2023-01-06 17:32:50] <%PanicRush> probably tab target
[2023-01-06 17:33:20] <%PanicRush> i mean, maybe it switches targets as if you pressed Tab on keyboard
[2023-01-06 17:33:25] <Rohafin> for example if u move your pvp trinket to B on the pad and u disable the addon consoleport. u have also moved the trinket to another spot on the bars.  if u planning on using only the controller its not a problem. but if u using both things keyboard & gamepad u going to mess things up. like i do play on steamdeck and keyboard but i dont want to keep messing up my bars when i am draggin my spells arround u have to drag the keybind to the spell.

[2023-01-06 17:40:29] <%Collnaris> that square has character specific keybinds, is that what you were looking for, or multiple keybind layouts for same character?
[2023-01-06 17:40:39] <Rohafin> if u now walk with keyboard the bind from ur keyboard will still be there
[2023-01-06 17:40:49] <%nufardetvaranog> @anniefuchsia det finns en addon som heter keybindprofiles. Om du vill göra en keybind profile som inte påverkar din main spec.

[2023-01-06 19:25:13] <%OJ_Hype> the moon mark you went to was in a pool of shit
[2023-01-06 19:25:13] <%Taylor131313> Annie if you didn't get one shot yet you're doing it right enough
[2023-01-06 19:25:21] <%Turbopumper> true and real
[2023-01-06 19:25:36] <%Taylor131313> that was close OMEGALUL
[2023-01-06 19:25:43] <%Wardrick7> you stood in the right place but there was pool in it thats why you took dmg
[2023-01-06 19:25:45] <%Taylor131313> if boss lasted 1sec more
[2023-01-06 19:25:56] <%Taylor131313> you would've exploded
[2023-01-06 19:25:56] <%PanicRush> oneshot would happen
[2023-01-06 19:26:26] <%Taylor131313> @AnnieFuchsia in that mechanic you stand on the white moons to not get oneshot

[2023-01-06 19:27:13] <%Taylor131313> I was also confused by it, but all moons seem to work the exact same no matter if it's full or not
[2023-01-06 19:27:25] <%Geoffku> you can share spots too right
[2023-01-06 19:27:28] <%Taylor131313> yes

[2023-01-06 19:27:36] <%Wardrick7> so moons mean nothing
[2023-01-06 19:27:44] <%Taylor131313> just stand on any partially white moon and you are fine

[2023-01-06 20:28:12] <%Twigbot4k> mythic+ instances have pushed many many players to chronically rush.  Always.  never stop for anything.  Very go go go.
[2023-01-06 20:28:26] <+martinwonder1> i think its because retail has a lot to do at endgame, therefore people don't want to feel like they're wasting their time

[2023-01-06 20:51:11] <%+marko_delvechio> To increase FPS you can always lower RENDER SCALE, but lowering it too much degrades quality.. Also texture filtering can be set to 4x instead of x16 on higher resolutions.

[2023-01-06 21:06:00] <%Morgonbladet> Then more people are saved
[2023-01-06 21:06:05] <Fyrstvidr> What is the max Achievement points one can get right now?
[2023-01-06 21:06:07] <%OJ_Hype> yeah so how can it be me then
[2023-01-06 21:06:18] <%Taylor131313> we got 6 loots the other bosses, it can't be only OJ's fault
[2023-01-06 21:07:04] <%decrode> does each boss have same total amount of loot that can drop?
[2023-01-06 21:07:10] <%OJ_Hype> no because i cant take up 2 loot
[2023-01-06 21:07:12] VIEWERS: 1 288
[2023-01-06 21:07:15] <%Taylor131313> means there's more than 1 person locked though
[2023-01-06 21:07:17] <Neycs> It counts the amount of people available to get the loot, so if enough people are locked the threshold for more loot isnt met and less loot is given to group
[2023-01-06 21:07:18] <%decrode> maybe depends on boss loot table size
[2023-01-06 21:07:24] <%Mirkooo> It's based on raid size yeah
[2023-01-06 21:07:27] <Rolaz> more people were saved last boss
[2023-01-06 21:07:34] <%+antibodies69> Its based on raid size yes
[2023-01-06 21:07:37] <%OJ_Hype> i swear we got less loot on some bosses in my guild raid too
[2023-01-06 21:07:50] <urbanation> that means there's more people saved

[2023-01-06 21:08:37] <%OJ_Hype> annie thing is it cant be a chance for 4 vs 6 loots
[2023-01-06 21:08:41] <Rolaz> too bad there no tools to check lockouts fast
[2023-01-06 21:08:45] <%OJ_Hype> it would be 4 vs 5
[2023-01-06 21:08:47] <%OJ_Hype> or 5 vs 6

[2023-01-06 21:09:28] <%OJ_Hype> but how can i soak loot, its for the raid size, it skips the personal bit Hmmge
[2023-01-06 21:09:31] <%Sne4ky79> then more has to be locked out @OJ_Hype only explaination
[2023-01-06 21:09:33] <%+Lorrdzik> @OJ_Hype can be if more poeple were loot locked on 4 drop boss
[2023-01-06 21:10:30] <%Mirkooo> 20% per person i think, so with 28 people would be 60% chance for 6th item
[2023-01-06 21:10:30] <urbanation> none saved people don't soak loot, it only means they are not counted for raid size
[2023-01-06 21:10:31] <%Geoffku> I somehow equipped a one hander and I don't know for how long it's been NotLikeThis
[2023-01-06 21:10:31] <%OJ_Hype> urbanation thats what i though
[2023-01-06 21:10:31] <Fanzer> I can sit out this one Annie, since I'm saved on council
[2023-01-06 21:10:32] <%Mirkooo> Yes, fact is we should 100% get a 5th piece LUL
[2023-01-06 21:10:32] <Fanzer> So you can get someone in for more loot
[2023-01-06 21:10:35] <%Taylor131313> the problem is that there's no official word on how it works
[2023-01-06 21:10:36] <%Taylor131313> blissart pls
[2023-01-06 21:10:44] <%Wardrick7> might be a bug
[2023-01-06 21:10:44] <urbanation> that many people are saved is the explanation
[2023-01-06 21:10:47] <Rolaz> hmm, i think that how it worked when it was personal loot, but now we have group loot and it works from raid size and saved people?
[2023-01-06 21:10:54] <Neycs> You had others locked too so your group size for loot table isn't 30 but for example 27 or 26..
[2023-01-06 21:11:08] <%+marko_delvechio> If a raid member is already saved for the boss, he DOES NOT count as a member in raid concerning the ammount of items droped.

[2023-01-06 21:12:30] <%OJ_Hype> on that boss
[2023-01-06 21:12:36] <%+marko_delvechio> Otherwise you could get 12 saved members, and one who is NOT saved, and he would get all items droped for himself,

[2023-01-06 21:16:41] <Rolaz> you can check who rolled for back i think
[2023-01-06 21:16:41] <%PneumaWHU> he wasn't saved on Kurog, but was saved on other bosses

[2023-01-06 21:21:30] <+Flobosama> as i said, happened to our raid and we chcecked all our lockouts, no one was saved and we lost loot on 2 bosses
[2023-01-06 21:21:31] <%Collnaris> assuming i have a brain PogO
[2023-01-06 21:21:40] <%PanicRush> but we are only 29 people, does that mean someone has 2 brains?
[2023-01-06 21:21:40] <+Flobosama> we always lose loot on sennarth for some reason

[2023-01-06 21:22:09] <+Flobosama> definitely something weird going on there
[2023-01-06 21:22:14] <Rolaz> does every boss have the same amount of loot? maybe Kurog have less loot, so there will be less items to drop?

Or do they reset each week?

[2023-01-06 22:18:55] <%epicpockettroll> u can maybe push with 10-15% left

[2023-01-06 22:20:45] <%+cuwane> would that plan have worked without viklund?
[2023-01-06 22:20:47] <%BrendanK> either reduce or work out how to do 3
[2023-01-06 22:20:54] <%YarrahExt> we should call viklund
[2023-01-06 22:20:57] <%whizakaz> we had dead people last time aswell, but yesh i dont think we can with this group
[2023-01-06 22:20:59] <Rolaz> you cant skip 3rd platform
[2023-01-06 22:21:04] <%epicpockettroll> u can do more than 2 waves, just have to live better then
[2023-01-06 22:21:05] <%BrendanK> progress with 3 I should say
[2023-01-06 22:21:13] <%Taylor131313> I didn't hear clearly that we should ignore add

[2023-01-06 22:21:20] <%Nurutooo> just do third add and it's kill
[2023-01-06 22:21:23] <%EnGronAnka> we skipped 3rd last week
[2023-01-06 22:21:23] <%Wardrick7> we said it on discord so who is not on it wouldnt have known
[2023-01-06 22:21:24] <%PneumaWHU> but hard to know what to do when being told 2 things
[2023-01-06 22:21:26] <%OJ_Hype> no you cant
[2023-01-06 22:21:31] <%whizakaz> nah dont think we can

[2023-01-06 22:21:38] <%whizakaz> i think we need reduce and do 2
[2023-01-06 22:21:42] <Rolaz> @BrendanK not with this dps, maybe if 2d add spawn with 20-25% of boss and raid have good healers
[2023-01-06 22:21:46] <%epicpockettroll> with this grp
[2023-01-06 22:21:47] <%OJ_Hype> reduce imo
[2023-01-06 22:21:49] <LightYearsAhead> @papo forgot your twitch username. you with the noob question, you only have chance of getting loot from each boss once a week
[2023-01-06 22:21:50] <%bYTEfROG> you said it on discord the moment the last add spawned tho
[2023-01-06 22:21:55] <%Geoffku> we had both OJ and viklund helping burn that last phase
[2023-01-06 22:22:00] <%Geoffku> instead of add
[2023-01-06 22:22:03] <%BrendanK> so say with this dps @Rolaz don't say you can't do it

[2023-01-06 22:31:16] <%PanicRush> a tank mechanic
[2023-01-06 22:31:16] <%Taylor131313> he probably could've survived that if topped
[2023-01-06 22:31:25] <%Draedra> thats the tank ability
[2023-01-06 22:31:29] <%Draedra> maybe he had too many stacks?
[2023-01-06 22:31:34] <%Morgonbladet> 3rd tank when we're up killing adds
[2023-01-06 22:31:39] <%Morgonbladet> tank stack
[2023-01-06 22:31:42] <Alcalines> tank stacks
[2023-01-06 22:31:46] <%Sne4ky79> he was healed but wasnt topped heal

[2023-01-06 22:39:52] <%epicpockettroll> mark on platform = people died when they shouldnt

[2023-01-06 22:59:11] <%Morgonbladet> first
[2023-01-06 22:59:12] <%Taylor131313> I thought reducing was a given LULE

[2023-01-06 22:59:36] <%epicpockettroll> tbh brood is trickier than rasza, rasza is more a numbers check
[2023-01-06 22:59:36] <%Sne4ky79> panic i think does? @epicpockettroll
[2023-01-06 22:59:36] <+Swabo> the reason you do 3 eggs on some is they also add 3 total eggs on the floor
[2023-01-06 23:00:00] <%notzemy> HE? HotPokket
[2023-01-06 23:00:00] <+Swabo> no instead of 25 there is 28

[2023-01-06 23:01:11] <%epicpockettroll> im not lootlocked
[2023-01-06 23:01:42] <%Sne4ky79> someone said 3rd tank might be needed?
[2023-01-06 23:01:59] <%Morgonbladet> I think we can do it 2
[2023-01-06 23:02:01] <%Taylor131313> someone was saying 3rd tank could help
[2023-01-06 23:02:04] <+itskoontz> 2 tanks can be used... if the eggs are popped correctly every time.
[2023-01-06 23:02:04] <%Taylor131313> but not needed
[2023-01-06 23:02:13] <%Sne4ky79> anniesShrug
[2023-01-06 23:02:16] <%epicpockettroll> cuz tank swapping between boss and adds is very anoying

[2023-01-06 23:05:54] <%Taylor131313> maybe hmmMeeting
[2023-01-06 23:06:06] <%Mirkooo> Can give it a try with 2-5-14 and see what's the issue
[2023-01-06 23:06:06] <%BrendanK> the thing you want 3rd tank for is the healing reduction on tank on brood
[2023-01-06 23:06:06] <%Morgonbladet> it's a healing reduction on tanks from boss
[2023-01-06 23:06:10] <%epicpockettroll> imo 3rd tank makes fight muuuuch ezier
[2023-01-06 23:06:11] <%Sne4ky79> anniesHmm

[2023-01-06 23:07:20] <%epicpockettroll> if ur on adds, its basically the same panic
[2023-01-06 23:07:24] <%PanicRush> depends what people decide
[2023-01-06 23:07:34] <%YarrahExt> i can tank if necessary, but shouldnt we try with 2?
[2023-01-06 23:07:39] <%OJ_Hype> i havent really paid attention to what our tanks do on this fight
[2023-01-06 23:07:45] <%PanicRush> yes, i was tanking ads because as a dh i can jump to them faster @epicpockettroll

[2023-01-06 23:22:53] <%SaintRyan_> @blaise_pmk WoW by default recommends 360 ilvl. For that high, I'd look for 370+ but look at their ratings too when they apply to join
[2023-01-06 23:22:57] <%Bitfrost9> hello Annie and chat! hope you're having a good stream!
[2023-01-06 23:23:00] <mcvultur> its all the time 2  only hatching  but you have 28 eggs and you have to destroy  them in 5 min  and he casts the  rod every 25 sec  @AnnieFuchsia
[2023-01-06 23:23:10] <%Mirkooo> It looked like we mainly only had 3 eggs, right?
[2023-01-06 23:23:12] <%epicpockettroll> for add grp, big adds (protodrake or bulky draconid) have big hp pool need to cleave off those
[2023-01-06 23:23:15] <%Mirkooo> 2*
[2023-01-06 23:23:23] <mcvultur> so you need destroy 3 eggs 4 times @AnnieFuchsia
[2023-01-06 23:23:27] <%nastye> @blaise_pmk its too complex of a matter to just say "invite only based on x or y", you just invite those that make you feel confident that you can time the key. remember that doing the biggest damage wont be the issue in 14, and interrupting and doing the mechanics is far more important. at the end of the day you wont know how well people play so its like a little lottery every time
[2023-01-06 23:23:29] <%Morgonbladet> ye image is just order
[2023-01-06 23:23:33] <%Mirkooo> Collnaris and i got one each, and then i didnt see another
[2023-01-06 23:23:34] <%PanicRush> 2 at a time
[2023-01-06 23:23:46] <%+Hezmund> ye it's 2 at a time but one set will have 3 eggs
[2023-01-06 23:23:51] <mcvultur> other  waves 2 by 2 @AnnieFuchsia
[2023-01-06 23:24:07] <+Swabo> the third egg being broken isnt to stop them from hatching only 2 will be impowered to hatch every time but she only does the staff so many times and she can not die if an egg is up so you need to kill the extra ones they spawn on heroic, and yes whenever you want thats just the route that worked for people
[2023-01-06 23:24:28] <%+Hezmund> @AnnieFuchsia scrap that, it's supposedly 2 eggs, then 1, 2 eggs then 1, kind of
[2023-01-06 23:24:29] <Pilky02> there is an order i believe, depends on how to tank moves. If tank has a route there are specific times where there will be a third egg
[2023-01-06 23:24:31] <%+ein_sof93> those eggs musta hurt on the way out look at how big and spikey they are, no wonder she's Madge

[2023-01-06 23:24:41] <%BrendanK> was expecting 3
[2023-01-06 23:25:03] <%Collnaris> go for overachieving
[2023-01-06 23:25:27] <mcvultur> you can see there are sets  so breaking 2 and leaving 1 rly far from the boss there will be no way to get it late  thats why is good to check where you need to break 3 and put a mark on the egg you will break
[2023-01-06 23:25:46] <%epicpockettroll> if u happen to get to all the eggs being destroyed, cue the metal music, cuz then things go south rq
[2023-01-06 23:26:05] <minicritter> only need to take the ones with a clock on it

[2023-01-06 23:27:58] <%nastye> @blaise_pmk the only way to guarantee that you will be in keys is by playing your own key and over time you will learn what to look for in applicants. if theyve done TONS of keys they are probably more comfortable with the mechanics of the dungeons. I used to do hundreds of keys across all roles every season and you just learn more about the dungeons every time :)

[2023-01-06 23:42:12] <mcvultur> @AnnieFuchsia  BTW you shouldnt break 3 eggs more than 4 times  to keep  it at 12  sets. Cus  once you break all  boss will go p2  and if he goes p2 early means high HP which will make it alot harder to kill
[2023-01-06 23:42:13] <%epicpockettroll> yeye u have to destroy them all, but just warning that it becomes a hellhole when it happens
[2023-01-06 23:42:20] <%Mirkooo> @Collnaris We should probably coordinate who goes left and who right, looking from the center of the room
