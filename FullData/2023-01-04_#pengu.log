[2023-01-04 15:34:34] <Frost_Aurora> @illustrate17 the new anti-cheat was how they handled the game ID, changing every 2 hours or so.
[2023-01-04 15:34:46] <Frost_Aurora> making it much harder for cheats to inject
[2023-01-04 15:34:49] <Frost_Aurora> and keep working

[2023-01-04 16:46:56] <thavitm> I’m on gold 4, getting 34 and losing 35, with a 52% win rate and a 1.2 kd. It seems a little bit unfair.
