[2022-12-27 00:19:53] <Sarcastically_Logical> @GarmrUSAF ngl though, know a handful of Vtubers who just haven't played Arma 3 before really, but want to. Its part of the reason I am learning how to make missions. Cause someday would love to get them together and some more people to have them run though a mission or two.

[2022-12-27 01:20:44] <%$iantheflat> Squad looks very interesting, but I guess you need a group for it. And I only have a Arma and GW2 group ^^"
[2022-12-27 01:20:58] <Skitter70> close
[2022-12-27 01:21:05] <%GarmrUSAF> @GarmrUSAF she'll be fine if she's with someone like Swat

[2022-12-27 01:23:59] <%$iantheflat> Do you want it to be more serious or more goofy? The gameplay I mean?
[2022-12-27 01:24:08] <%$iantheflat> scratch the last questionmark
[2022-12-27 01:24:35] <%+Celebrant23> thats what makes squad not fun
[2022-12-27 01:24:42] <%+Celebrant23> the tryhards ruin squad
[2022-12-27 01:24:48] <susanaeliasolraysioseum> What do you mean freedom? Like just chatting or the fact that because you’ve got to keep chatting or entertaining?
[2022-12-27 01:24:56] <%+Celebrant23> squad is most fun when your shitting around imo
[2022-12-27 01:24:58] <%LossyInput> there's a lot of downtime

[2022-12-27 01:25:46] <%$iantheflat> Understandable, I know a few people that make great highlight videos with Squad. I geuss the same can be applied to Arma, with a lot of downtime between fights.
[2022-12-27 01:25:46] <%+Celebrant23> its impossible to moderate what people say ingame most of the time its pretty racist or homophobic
[2022-12-27 01:25:49] <scenewon_p1niot_leataul> the server you're on yup
[2022-12-27 01:26:37] <%+Celebrant23> the learnign curve is very easy
[2022-12-27 01:26:48] <%+Celebrant23> not as complicated as arma

[2022-12-27 01:27:46] <readingforliberation> Think Insurgency is more streamable
