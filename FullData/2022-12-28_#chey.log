[2022-12-28 00:29:52] <!%+awesometrax> At least if they're pitch shifting or hiding names it's more of a "don't act like this" kind of thing and making it clear to not send hate towards them

[2022-12-28 19:59:18] <%SunLukong> Maybe. It was on RPD and they summoned Victor in main lobby and tried to jump him to the second floor. Then ran him all the way up and I palleted him
[2022-12-28 19:59:37] <!%+awesometrax> That's different lol. But I don't like facing Franklin's. Half the time it feels like they're flipping me off
