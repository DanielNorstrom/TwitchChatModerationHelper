[2022-12-15 17:02:22] <%babylettuceboi> that happens when i leave my hair up too long

[2022-12-15 17:03:04] <%deadwud> I wonder if the vikings of old used to cry about their hair hurting from their helmets

[2022-12-15 17:05:56] <+rimmerzine> Wife didn't like the original, so I probably won't be until it's available to stream somewhere

[2022-12-15 17:06:09] <%babylettuceboi> transformers are so good
[2022-12-15 17:06:17] <%deadwud> I'll watch it but probably not in the theatre
[2022-12-15 17:06:31] <+lstratz> Speaking of payment. What are the ad incentives looking like right now for the holidays? Like percentage wise
[2022-12-15 17:06:49] <+lstratz> I know they're a lot higher because everyone is trying to stream more right now
[2022-12-15 17:07:04] <BadAtAnyGame> is this still unranked games or silver? i cant tell the difference

[2022-12-15 17:07:13] <xGenero> the enemy rein backfilled into the wrong neighbourhood >=]
[2022-12-15 17:07:28] <+clammy_piano> COVID ruined the experience becuase it had been so long
[2022-12-15 17:07:29] <MrStoneski> u can watch at home and order pizza or something for cheaper than it costs at a movie theatre
[2022-12-15 17:07:32] <%+anqzs_> @madkiller92 hah thanks bro thats why im glad mr streamer streams all night for me
[2022-12-15 17:07:35] <$censelow> I just go to the cinemas for the snacks they have, even though they're really overpriced
[2022-12-15 17:07:39] <%deadwud> Yeah, they're available to stream a lot sooner than they used to be
[2022-12-15 17:07:40] <MrStoneski> plus u can pause to piss
[2022-12-15 17:07:40] <xGenero> nvm
[2022-12-15 17:08:07] <+lstratz> I would go to the movies if they didn't use projectors
[2022-12-15 17:08:10] <%+PlantedPlanter> damn

[2022-12-15 17:08:22] <+lstratz> They need to start improving the screen tech with mini LED or some shit
[2022-12-15 17:08:39] <probablyNotASpider> i would go to the movies if everyone around me shut up and left their phones off
[2022-12-15 17:08:43] <%+PlantedPlanter> @lstratz whats wrong with projectors
[2022-12-15 17:08:45] <%deadwud> Really big TVs are much more affordable now too
[2022-12-15 17:09:01] <+lstratz> @lstratz Its just washed out and looks like garbanzo

[2022-12-15 17:09:16] <+lstratz> your screen at home probably looks better its just smaller but you sit close to it anyway
[2022-12-15 17:09:20] <squid_nee_> walmart had a 65 in for $280 on black friday üòç
[2022-12-15 17:09:22] <Senkyy> Guys, why is the Queue for ranked so long
[2022-12-15 17:09:25] <+lstratz> so it takes up most of your field of view
[2022-12-15 17:09:28] <%madkiller92> just watch it on the home theater EZ
[2022-12-15 17:09:29] <+TheRealRubyRoo> @deadwud hollywood knows that they need it as available as possible because they'll lose money because covid, people didn't want to go close to eachother ect, and honestly the comfort of your own home?
[2022-12-15 17:09:31] <+TheRealRubyRoo> why not
[2022-12-15 17:10:01] <+TheRealRubyRoo> you can make your own food, and the movie companies don't get paid for you to get food IN the theater, why not make it yourself
[2022-12-15 17:10:15] <nozar123> haha
[2022-12-15 17:10:19] <+TheRealRubyRoo> it's healthier and safer and if anyone has food allergies, ect
[2022-12-15 17:10:28] <nozar123> you're bullying them so hard
[2022-12-15 17:10:29] <+TheRealRubyRoo> literally just stream it in your house
