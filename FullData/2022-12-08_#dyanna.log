[2022-12-08 01:09:51] <ween420> in the snow always
[2022-12-08 01:09:53] <itsyapidoo> is it spamming jackie better now than tapping ?
[2022-12-08 01:12:07] <grunwode> apparently it was patched to not need tapping
[2022-12-08 01:12:40] <teqilakaze00> power mighty f
[2022-12-08 01:12:50] <itsyapidoo> Maybe deepo and then back?
[2022-12-08 01:13:38] <itsyapidoo> Looks like its losing electricy.. not enough power
[2022-12-08 01:15:35] <teqilakaze00> pog
[2022-12-08 01:15:37] <grunwode> Sensors can generate a small amount of power.
[2022-12-08 01:15:51] <urs4ru> brake the battery maybe
[2022-12-08 01:16:04] <%fathagel> Hatchet is strong against turret.
[2022-12-08 01:18:22] <%barbiturikaa> I think night time maybe he doesn't have enough solar panels to feed the battery
[2022-12-08 01:18:42] <%barbiturikaa> and it turns off at night and some minutes after
[2022-12-08 01:19:25] <grunwode> Could fire arrow the solar panels.
[2022-12-08 01:20:13] <itsyapidoo> I think deepo is better and then back

[2022-12-08 01:27:56] <%fathagel> Takes 250 or so nails...
[2022-12-08 01:28:09] <Sieegfreed> you can use Fire Arrows if you have too, more damage if the fire hits the turret
[2022-12-08 01:28:09] <teqilakaze00> oh ok
[2022-12-08 01:28:17] <%royal_peasy> yeah the compound bow would take a little bit longer.. the key to speeding things up would be fire arrows. FBtouchdown iriskPookieJammer
[2022-12-08 01:28:24] <%fathagel> Might want to kep an axe in case power drops...

[2022-12-08 02:49:10] <Heiry_Putter> 12 spears and upgrade them to stone with 25 stones each why even bother with tier 1
[2022-12-08 02:50:20] <grunwode> Seems like base design would be more creative without the sides mechanic.
[2022-12-08 02:50:40] <@%wallyjj> like 5 minutes
[2022-12-08 02:50:47] <%tsg_derby> prolly like 30k stone n wood in there us n00bs love farmin

[2022-12-08 23:44:22] <Sieegfreed> embrasures?
[2022-12-08 23:44:25] <%VF_Kerimoff> u can use metal shopfronts instead of window, if u ll not shoot from there
[2022-12-08 23:44:43] <%VF_Kerimoff> but u have to demolosh window building and build wallframe for that
[2022-12-08 23:45:10] <AFckingJhinius> You can built by the cliff to  get it

[2022-12-08 23:56:39] <%VF_Kerimoff> yes but also lazy for expand base for cover it))
[2022-12-08 23:57:06] <%vidxstan> I usually prefer to buy a refinery in Outpost or have 1 by drop
[2022-12-08 23:57:09] <%VF_Kerimoff> have 3k hours and still all i can build is 2x2 starter ))
[2022-12-08 23:57:40] <%vidxstan> When I start it's common to use Outpost's refinery for myself
[2022-12-08 23:57:44] <%VF_Kerimoff> tried to learn on building servers
[2022-12-08 23:58:19] <%vidxstan> I value more inventory space to have enough mats to build a starter
[2022-12-08 23:58:20] <%VF_Kerimoff> but every time it ended up with a alt f4 ))
[2022-12-08 23:58:32] <%MoneyNova> i never have the energy to farm.
[2022-12-08 23:58:40] <%vidxstan> I am afraid of making wooden door starter bases
