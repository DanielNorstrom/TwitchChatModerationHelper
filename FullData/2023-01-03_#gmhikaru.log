[2023-01-03 22:55:14] <@%^Moobot> @pekka03748 Hikaru's regular board is Icy Sea and the pieces are Glass.
[2023-01-03 22:55:14] <+giosvigor> Does Hikaru not mention Hans anymore? That was the real purpose of the lawsuit, I think. To chill his free speech. It is a frivolous law suit. Hans will pay for it.
