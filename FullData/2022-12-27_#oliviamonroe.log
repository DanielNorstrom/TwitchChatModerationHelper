[2022-12-27 16:08:13] <!%AirahsELL> how many burping contests did you have to witness to feel so strongly
[2022-12-27 16:08:17] <WUOTE> ok you can get rid of one of the two but the other one gets 3 times worse which one do you choose: burping or farting
[2022-12-27 16:08:21] <!Fuzzgotgames> I relate to that

[2022-12-27 18:07:46] <%Temporal_Paradox> you shouldn't force anything to crack, you can cause damage by doing that, but it's not the cracking itself
[2022-12-27 18:07:49] <$StrikingWalrus> yes, she's a well know mangaka

[2022-12-27 18:21:32] <%MayShip> Jack in the Box, is my desperation joint
[2022-12-27 18:21:33] <%Edibleghost> Wendys has the better burgers now
[2022-12-27 18:21:33] <+JohnNiles> my folks brought home an extra BK burger and I refused it in favor of a plain ole sandwich
[2022-12-27 18:21:34] <%eyecca> there is love in burguer king, they inderictly kiss every burguer by sneezing on the buns and all
[2022-12-27 18:21:41] <%Paranormal_Instigator> yeah the fries ain't great
[2022-12-27 18:21:44] <%Dovakoda1> I think Popeye's is worse than BK
[2022-12-27 18:21:50] <TechnoSugarCreations> I love Burger King. The one I used to go to in Louisville? They got SO used to me coming to pick up food on the way home from work on Tuesdays, they'd see me come in and go, "Bridgette's here with her coupons! Get the original chicken sandwhiches plain with cheese ready!"
[2022-12-27 18:21:51] <!%AirahsELL> number 15: burger king foot lettuce.
[2022-12-27 18:22:02] <itsDingusKhan> AIN’T NO WAY
[2022-12-27 18:22:06] <%$PleaseStopSayingLiterally> foot lettuce?
[2022-12-27 18:22:06] <%+PedroYuuhi> BK US tastes different than BK Brazil
[2022-12-27 18:22:06] <Bionic_Hippo> Popeye's is good af what
[2022-12-27 18:22:09] <%+ElleandBooster> do people just like super thin oily fries? BK fries have always been great to me
[2022-12-27 18:22:14] <%Furudehan> McDonald's has the best fries in all fast food.
[2022-12-27 18:22:15] <itsDingusKhan> I’m coping seething writhing screaming crying sliding off the wall
[2022-12-27 18:22:17] <%Temporal_Paradox> I do still like their original chicken sandwiches but I think it's just nostalgia
[2022-12-27 18:22:19] <+woozytiger> five guys and fries ?
[2022-12-27 18:22:28] <%Temporal_Paradox> they have good gravy
[2022-12-27 18:22:40] <TechnoSugarCreations> I only had 5 Guys once at a karaoke party. Loved it.
[2022-12-27 18:22:40] <%TamakoHenka> So you like it thicc...is that what I just heard?
[2022-12-27 18:22:41] <onsenmark> Hardee's has the best chicken that's not KFC
[2022-12-27 18:22:42] <+JohnNiles> I liked Arby's curly fries, but not enough to go out of my way for fast food
[2022-12-27 18:22:46] <onsenmark> IMO
[2022-12-27 18:22:46] <%+shibiririreruwa> Five Guy's is pretty mid for how expensive it is
[2022-12-27 18:22:46] <%+PedroYuuhi> idk
[2022-12-27 18:22:47] <%Furudehan> Never had.
[2022-12-27 18:22:49] <@%DrGoodStrats> Five guys is great. I always feel like I'm going to die after though
[2022-12-27 18:22:50] <itsDingusKhan> There is zero seasonings on BK fries
[2022-12-27 18:22:51] <%SlimeSlimeSlime> Ultra High
[2022-12-27 18:22:51] <%SaviSenpaii> low for me
[2022-12-27 18:22:52] <Bionic_Hippo> for fast food, they're a high
[2022-12-27 18:22:54] <staelios> high but way too expensive
[2022-12-27 18:22:57] <%oddgoblinz> low here in texas
[2022-12-27 18:22:57] <+JohnNiles> tried 5 guys a few times, they dumped so much salt on the fries, I couldn't eat em
[2022-12-27 18:22:57] <%+ElleandBooster> low. Too greasy and procey for me
[2022-12-27 18:22:59] <Rarefoil> Mid
[2022-12-27 18:23:00] <itsDingusKhan> Five guys is mid for me
[2022-12-27 18:23:01] <%gambitmojo> it JUST seems more sanitary to make your ownfood
[2022-12-27 18:23:03] <Tylphen> High. used to have a place at the college i went to and became too poor to attend
[2022-12-27 18:23:06] <%GinTamashiVT> I don't remember last time I had 5 Guys

[2022-12-27 18:23:07] <syoxiss> never had five guys, dont have it here
[2022-12-27 18:23:12] <TechnoSugarCreations> When I was a kid, I used to call crinkle cut fries 'Staircase French Fires', lol
[2022-12-27 18:23:12] <+woozytiger> i like potato wedges
[2022-12-27 18:23:15] <%$ArcReaper_21> 5 Guys is fine, but MID due to price
[2022-12-27 18:23:16] <Rarefoil> Oli have you had Smashburger? They are high
[2022-12-27 18:23:19] <%Dovakoda1> Yeah the fries at bk are great, five guy's fries are good. five guys > bk, though
[2022-12-27 18:23:19] <onsenmark> Where's the love for Nando's?
[2022-12-27 18:23:19] <%+shibiririreruwa> I've had better burgers at sit down places for cheaper and got them faster
[2022-12-27 18:23:20] <%+PedroYuuhi> I think McDonalds is the bais for judgment
[2022-12-27 18:23:21] <abysshunted> great food, never had it
[2022-12-27 18:23:33] <%$ArcReaper_21> No Wendy's?
[2022-12-27 18:23:34] <@%DrGoodStrats> Five guys is a bit pricy
[2022-12-27 18:23:38] <%TalkingObject> Sweet potato fries?
[2022-12-27 18:23:39] <Rarefoil> :O
[2022-12-27 18:23:43] <YuzuAdagioCh> I wanna try Nando's!!
[2022-12-27 18:23:45] <%SaviSenpaii> never had it
[2022-12-27 18:23:48] <%Dovakoda1> When are we going to tell ollie about the tier lists?
[2022-12-27 18:23:48] <onsenmark> Nando's is high
[2022-12-27 18:23:50] <%TalkingObject> I never heard of smash burger
[2022-12-27 18:23:55] <%+shibiririreruwa> Pollo Loco?
[2022-12-27 18:23:56] <TechnoSugarCreations> Never had actual Smash Burger, but hubby makes his own smash burgers at home and they. Are. FIRE the way he makes them.
[2022-12-27 18:23:57] <Tylphen> the amount of fries Five Guys give you kinda ruins the flavor. and their fries have always been kinda too soft
[2022-12-27 18:23:58] <onsenmark> Nando's is freaking god-tier
[2022-12-27 18:23:59] <itsDingusKhan> Honestly, for the same price as Five Guys, I can go to one of the higher-up burger joints near me. I have to wait a little longer, but they taste way better
[2022-12-27 18:24:03] <%Furudehan> I'd love to stick around and backseat but I'm gonna sleep for a bit.
[2022-12-27 18:24:04] <itsDingusKhan> Like Burger Republic or somethin
[2022-12-27 18:24:09] <%GinTamashiVT> That could be fun!
[2022-12-27 18:24:13] <!%WHYTEA> NODDERS
[2022-12-27 18:24:13] <Rarefoil> Smashburger's burgers are the best to me :(
[2022-12-27 18:24:15] <%+PedroYuuhi> I saw a bunch of Arby's commercials on twitter, are they any good tho?
[2022-12-27 18:24:25] <%Temporal_Paradox> Arby's is decent

[2022-12-27 18:24:38] <%+shibiririreruwa> Arby's is alright. People clown on it too much
[2022-12-27 18:24:39] <YuzuAdagioCh> Arby's is good, I always forget it's a thing tho
[2022-12-27 18:24:41] <@%DrGoodStrats> Arby's is mid.
[2022-12-27 18:24:43] <%+PedroYuuhi> I legit don't remember this one

[2022-12-27 18:24:55] <@%DrGoodStrats> People hate on it excessively but I wouldn't intentionally go there
[2022-12-27 18:24:59] <staelios> Arby's reubens are great

[2022-12-27 18:52:57] <ZER0_exp0> The reason why bullets in this game don’t kill you instantly is that the robots don’t shoot the bullets the normal way but instead they use springs and lob them at you.

[2022-12-27 19:10:15] <@%owlishnick> Yeah it had Robin Williams in it
[2022-12-27 19:10:17] <%TalkingObject> I saw Robots
[2022-12-27 19:10:18] <%Nullamm> Never saw it
[2022-12-27 19:10:18] <Appleman6> It had Robin Williams
[2022-12-27 19:10:21] <%+Dataskvid> The hit animation movie from 2005???
[2022-12-27 19:10:21] <MysticDragonrose> yes, it was quite popular
[2022-12-27 19:10:23] <%TamakoHenka> Yes, I've seen it, and I can see why you think this
[2022-12-27 19:10:24] <%Edibleghost> Rodney Copperbottom
[2022-12-27 19:10:25] <abysshunted> people like to draw that one chunky lady robot with a fat dumpy... don't ask how I know this
[2022-12-27 19:10:26] <%+PedroYuuhi> THIS MOVIE IS BASED
[2022-12-27 19:10:29] <%ZataraSWE> seen it
[2022-12-27 19:10:29] <Arubatorion_> does it have a bot with huge butt?
[2022-12-27 19:10:33] <%deadbeat444> They went around the city in little balls or whatever right
[2022-12-27 19:10:37] <%Carkistador> "the fun part is making the baby"
[2022-12-27 19:10:39] <%Dovakoda1> I saw it I think, but I don't remember it
[2022-12-27 19:10:40] <Irmis_LV> it had a cool car
[2022-12-27 19:10:43] <%$SirArchemKnight> IT was certainly a movie
[2022-12-27 19:10:45] <%$ArcReaper_21> I, Robot? Isn't that the Will Smith movie?
[2022-12-27 19:10:47] <ZER0_exp0> The one with the red robot singing Britney Spears
[2022-12-27 19:10:48] <Rarefoil> I don't think that movie was ever that popular
[2022-12-27 19:10:50] <%SaintanickClause> yeah the world wouldn't forget the dumpy koriChad
[2022-12-27 19:10:56] <MysticDragonrose> I see people talk about it pretty often on Tumblr? Usually for that cross-dressing bit but still
[2022-12-27 19:11:00] <%A1va300> 2005
[2022-12-27 19:11:02] <+RocketSP13> Controversial take: While it would be cool to have more official levels, narratively we don't need a Portal 3
[2022-12-27 19:11:04] <%$SirArchemKnight> I remember that movie, it was real big then vanished in like a week
[2022-12-27 19:11:04] <merchmandan> The huge butt is probably why nobody talks about it
[2022-12-27 19:11:06] <%Edibleghost> It's message is about tearing down corporations so it was suppressed by the ruling elite
[2022-12-27 19:11:07] <%+darkteatime> Never even heard of it
[2022-12-27 19:11:07] <%Carkistador> we watched it in college lol
[2022-12-27 19:11:10] <%$SirArchemKnight> It even got a game spinofff

[2022-12-27 19:16:25] <Appleman6> There’s this one moment in the Robinsons that I thought you as a weird joke as a kid, but years later I realized it was actually a super sad line
[2022-12-27 19:16:29] <abysshunted> Chicken Little from the hit game Kingdom Hearts 2
[2022-12-27 19:16:29] <%Carkistador> I've only seen part of chicken little
[2022-12-27 19:16:34] <melonarious> Chicken little is not based, quite cringe even
[2022-12-27 19:16:38] <%Temporal_Paradox> Stewart little was a mouse not a chicken
[2022-12-27 19:16:39] <%+PedroYuuhi> They literally lobotomized that pig gurl
[2022-12-27 19:16:41] <TechnoSugarCreations> Chicken Little's dad tinkled me off. He was a total narcissist.
[2022-12-27 19:16:41] <+BasicMoose> I was not into chicken little

[2022-12-27 19:44:12] <$haiddon> it's not a hot take. they actually really struggled with the aesthetic of this game because they didn't want just another bunch of sterile rooms

[2022-12-27 19:44:19] <%+PedroYuuhi> 3 acts, this is the first
[2022-12-27 19:44:21] <%+aathray> that's kinda the point but also it's intended because it's a distinct style to recognize especially at this point going forward
