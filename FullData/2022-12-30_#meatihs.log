[2022-12-30 00:03:34] <@%Tinyfred> It's kind of embarrassing how little interaction there is between players each game.
[2022-12-30 00:03:41] <!%Carlthuzad> only decks*
[2022-12-30 00:03:46] <+bluedevilblue> @ChristyMacAndCheese Is it 30 card?  Because I would think you'd want more consistency in your removal and armor.
[2022-12-30 00:03:47] <greekiller98> i missed the old meta before dh

[2022-12-30 00:10:45] <HeeJaw> A 30 card deck is stronger than a 40 card deck. Because you can pick away 10 of the worst cards in the 40 card deck. Am i right or wrong?
[2022-12-30 00:11:42] <authorJeMac> Its in standard

[2022-12-30 02:02:25] <Pinpenade> I think hair loss can be related To testostérone levels, so it could be attractive for women. Jason statam for example is considered as a sex symbol (but… yes, he has muscles and money, that helps ;)).
[2022-12-30 02:02:27] <ProgettazioneInferni> have you ever visited a chatter from the stream?

[2022-12-30 02:03:04] <@zridex> @Pinpenade hair loss is not related to testosterone. its related to DHT, secondary adrogenic male hormone. you can be low testosterone and high DHT at the same time

[2022-12-30 22:35:24] <+otiumislife> Best meta was with grim patron imo
[2022-12-30 22:35:29] <megatrade1> is this deck better or the other quest one ?
[2022-12-30 22:35:33] <+otiumislife> Really fun deck

[2022-12-30 22:35:41] <AvasiiaHS> @cinnamonchair because they didn't want Dh to flop and not be beta so they overshoot.

[2022-12-30 22:35:57] <Barsolar> hearthstone was better when cards were valuable and playing for tempo meant you weren't playing for value. for me HS got bad even aggro decks stopped running out of steam

[2022-12-30 22:38:20] <jjrodriguezmayo> agreed, shadowstep needs to go
[2022-12-30 22:38:26] <AvasiiaHS> my biggest disappointment for the expansion is how underwhelming DK is. I would have loved to have it be busted just for the sake or having a totally new class in the spotlight
[2022-12-30 22:38:30] <xamatranscendental> where is rheno?

[2022-12-30 22:39:59] <xamatranscendental> draka is gone
[2022-12-30 22:40:23] <+cinnamonchair> i think potion belt on 2 for coc wildpaw is whats making it so explosive
[2022-12-30 22:40:31] <pepefrogqt> broken card costs 1 more mana now = Dead card Kappa
[2022-12-30 22:40:41] <@%$Raptorheart> It's weird that Shadowstep has survived forever despite Wild Growth and War Axe getting instanerfed
[2022-12-30 22:40:42] <Takkon> concoctions are very good, but they are value and rogue has cards that feed off of vallue and magify it.
[2022-12-30 22:40:49] <+ShootyGoBang> Maybe instead of nerfing stuff they should buff other stuff so everything is busted. I call it the Modern Warfare (2011) meta.

[2022-12-30 23:00:34] <+cinnamonchair> shiny portraits and diamond cards are too good
[2022-12-30 23:00:36] <sgsayuri> Which is the point, the person who wants them enabled can see them, but there should be an option for the people who dislike them to disable them
[2022-12-30 23:01:04] <+ShootyGoBang> I like alternate heroes like Tyrande for priest and Arthas for paladin but the deathknight-looking skins for other classes is daft (except for t he Hero Cards in KotFT, those were baller)

[2022-12-30 23:34:15] <%+1mikas> nah I play this deck on mobile
[2022-12-30 23:34:16] <HeeJaw> It was a Blizzard employee.
[2022-12-30 23:34:19] <+iTvngo> That was very obvious no animation cheating
[2022-12-30 23:34:21] <AvasiiaHS> usually these people only do it in wild were nobody care
[2022-12-30 23:34:27] <fly1ngcat> whats the combo
[2022-12-30 23:34:33] <NoahCraye> he was playing in a kitchen too, cool it.
[2022-12-30 23:34:33] <+cinnamonchair> @pocket_train how do you animation cheat, is that a real thing?
[2022-12-30 23:34:33] <@%pocket_train> @cinnamonchair idk but it was a problem in wild for ages, there are videos of ignite mage cheaters
[2022-12-30 23:34:34] <Rumpchocken> he got rid of animations somehow
[2022-12-30 23:34:37] <+ShootyGoBang> Unless it's something like that snipsnap bug idk
[2022-12-30 23:34:38] <poogyboy> PETPET  pokiDance
[2022-12-30 23:34:38] <kyonism> Theres a cheat to increase fps on your client so you   Can play more animations
[2022-12-30 23:34:44] <+cinnamonchair> @pocket_train ohhh
[2022-12-30 23:35:02] <poogyboy> PETPET  peepoFine
[2022-12-30 23:35:08] <%chasaaaaam> Whats animation cheat and how does it work? Asking for a friend
[2022-12-30 23:35:08] <fly1ngcat> @kyonism but is it really a cheat tho
[2022-12-30 23:35:20] <@%pocket_train> It is a cheat. People have been banned for it
[2022-12-30 23:35:29] <Alpr1010> you can click the card to speed it up on your side. Or alt+f4 and restart hearthstone.
[2022-12-30 23:35:31] <Lvl_100_Magikarp> all animations should be bg speed
[2022-12-30 23:35:33] <!%+shanevapid> man w/e my neighbor is cooking smells good
[2022-12-30 23:35:33] <fly1ngcat> that sounds like a blizzard problem
[2022-12-30 23:35:34] <Ulcor99> which priest svalna variant is best you think? this from last game or play this with mill or armor?
[2022-12-30 23:35:37] <kyonism> @fly1ngcat you need to modify game files so by blizz stabdards, yes it is
[2022-12-30 23:35:46] <!%+Jymbo26> Give us the option of animations at all
[2022-12-30 23:35:47] <nops___> instead of banning people for cheating with it in wild they nerfed sorc to make the deck unplayable
[2022-12-30 23:35:48] <atomicwaffleks> @chasaaaaam so essentially its a prgrom they run that maliciously interacts with hs client and speeds up the frames per second of their client drasticallly
[2022-12-30 23:36:00] <mawningcoffee> like TFT doesnt have these ridiculous animations
[2022-12-30 23:36:00] <Dysphotic> animations in hs like speed limits irl
