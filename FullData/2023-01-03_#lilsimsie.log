[2023-01-03 22:23:32] <$bts_loona> the stone is too modern
[2023-01-03 22:23:32] <%hannahhurn> The colour green sliding would like nice with the purple potentially
[2023-01-03 22:23:32] <%$lucaskskss> yeaa the wood on the front!!
[2023-01-03 22:23:32] <wardenathreni> yeah that looks good
[2023-01-03 22:23:33] <+chloet877> @kaytast cat allergy is for sure a red flagüö©
[2023-01-03 22:23:34] <brandon_989> use a beige brick!
[2023-01-03 22:23:34] <mrkibling> is there a stream tomorrow?
[2023-01-03 22:23:36] <lavenderxy> Maybe no stone?
[2023-01-03 22:23:36] <%$peaceloveAlex> Maybe cover a wall with moss
[2023-01-03 22:23:37] <kajsa02> maybe try the stone on a different wall? it‚Äôs so nice
[2023-01-03 22:23:37] <%+morepanthers> @kaidoeswatch  you need to add ice to your fridge I think.  and there are some stoves that don't need electricity
[2023-01-03 22:23:37] <%royalktea> I think the stone is too dark
[2023-01-03 22:23:38] <%+madisonemily8> i feel like the lighting in build mode should be separate from the regular game lighting. like you should have an option to just have "build mode lighting" that is plain
[2023-01-03 22:23:38] <%+minleafy> i think its the four different levels.. it looks unbalanced maybe?
[2023-01-03 22:23:38] <%NicholleStephani> I‚Äôve just been listening and haven‚Äôt looked until now. This is SO cute. I want to live here next to a lake with a bunch of spruce trees.
[2023-01-03 22:23:41] <%beetroot747> maybe try a lighter one, like white bricks?
[2023-01-03 22:23:41] <angelcalledlia> Get together stone foundation?
[2023-01-03 22:23:41] <%+Erencgunes> i thought henford on bagley had the most beautiful lighting in the game

[2023-01-03 22:23:44] <chantie30> yes!
[2023-01-03 22:23:44] <thefernp1ant> Is there any lot in the sims 4 that has good lighting? I haven‚Äôt seen any yet, the colors on houses always look a little off on any lot I build on

[2023-01-03 22:25:52] <$pixievine> Something cool toned bc of the purple maybe
[2023-01-03 22:25:53] <saphisscared> I think the lighting is what makes it look a bit pink
[2023-01-03 22:25:53] <%+kkotafish> its cute!
[2023-01-03 22:25:54] <mih455> have you seen white lotus?
[2023-01-03 22:25:55] <brandon_989> maybe not the extension and the chimney stone?

[2023-01-03 22:26:01] <chantie30> maybe try the roof bumpout in stone?
[2023-01-03 22:26:02] <%+morepanthers> pink vs purple depends on your monitor I think
[2023-01-03 22:26:03] <%$userlameuserlame> main box stone and the rest purple?
[2023-01-03 22:26:03] <angelcalledlia> It looks so cute!

[2023-01-03 22:26:04] <+Angelas_Folly> the lighting pink-ifies the color, it's purple friends
[2023-01-03 22:26:04] <lilfreaksinthejeep_> snappy looks so comfy
[2023-01-03 22:26:05] <+brucecaboose99> What if you did that wooden panelling on the side instead of stone :-)
[2023-01-03 22:26:05] <roztomili_spak> i like it like this
[2023-01-03 22:26:06] <%$kira_laine> snappy hiding her face simsieLove
[2023-01-03 22:26:07] <!%+rivkael> maybe panelling on the chimney and roof bits rather thn sone

[2023-01-03 22:26:09] <yoonminnie13> ston e in the middle would look nice instead of the sides i think. different

[2023-01-03 22:26:13] <whosetoe> maybe paneling for the door so the purple stands out
[2023-01-03 22:26:14] <hannip9> It would fit so good in Sylvan Glade<3

[2023-01-03 22:26:28] <absolutelyck> I think stone for the main part of the house makes sense and purple paint for the ‚Äúextensions‚Äù
[2023-01-03 22:26:28] <lavenderxy> A swatch update would be cool

[2023-01-03 22:26:36] <%+ladyartful> maybe bring purple in with flower boxes?
[2023-01-03 22:26:36] <%+hayleybugg_> is it just the lighting that is making ttha tlook pink or is it actually pink

[2023-01-03 22:27:19] <abergerburger> You could think of it like the stone is where the original house was, and the purple are slightly more modern add ons

[2023-01-03 22:27:49] <nakaharadesu> the paint doesn't really make sense for exterior, needs like siding or paneling

[2023-01-03 23:00:20] <%Crazyaimster7> Its too moderny i think, just an opinion xx
[2023-01-03 23:00:20] <alexapotts> The most important question is : do u like it Simsie ?
[2023-01-03 23:00:21] <sylviat21> I definitely think it works
[2023-01-03 23:00:21] <safortuga> it does look cottage-y but too strong

[2023-01-03 23:00:23] <JemmaGrl> Maybe it will be more cohesive when you landscape it.
[2023-01-03 23:00:23] <%+cloudberrytart> very cottagey
[2023-01-03 23:00:24] <%hannahhurn> Add don‚Äôt greenery or vines?
[2023-01-03 23:00:25] <%artsyEmma> I do not get a modern vibe from this fence
[2023-01-03 23:00:25] <%PinkyJapan> We love it
[2023-01-03 23:00:26] <%Mazziee92> Could be good for either I think
[2023-01-03 23:00:26] <%+madisonemily8> the only part i can see MAYBE be more modern is the little columns
[2023-01-03 23:00:26] <absolutelyck> I like it but add vinesto it
[2023-01-03 23:00:26] <pheonixox_> it looks really cute

[2023-01-03 23:25:00] <Leichy22> do you think sims is more fun when you can talk to someone all the time? for me it gets boring if i play it alone idk
[2023-01-03 23:25:00] <%bekahsayshi> Yeah like wanting company while you play, that‚Äôs understandable!
[2023-01-03 23:25:00] <%afrench1520> You owe us nothing bestie

[2023-01-03 23:25:02] <@%+MrsTomato101814> plot twist: streamer is parasocial towards her community /j
[2023-01-03 23:25:05] <h_fergie> U don‚Äôt owe anyone anything

[2023-01-03 23:25:10] <omniousiy> no i literally be wishing i was a steamer bc plsying the sims by yourself is boring sometimes!!
[2023-01-03 23:25:12] <@%brewwin> thats why streamers need different hobbies than video games hahaha
[2023-01-03 23:25:13] <%$sabrinarocks3> @MrsTomato101814 lolll

[2023-01-03 23:25:22] <sararubys2011> yeah that makes sense because you always play a game with like people interacting with you so it must be weird to like just play without it
[2023-01-03 23:25:26] <%simslord15> Simsie, you didn't See My Prime sub :(
[2023-01-03 23:25:26] <ashley_vt827> Yeah a lot of streamers have that mindset or feel guilty playing a game for themselves when they could stream it I‚Äôm sorry you deal with that too
[2023-01-03 23:25:27] <galaxy37802> It‚Äôs like a bonus that you get money
[2023-01-03 23:25:27] <kcupcake31> do you think having a "9 to 5" would be easier to you or do you think this fits you best? i feel like some people wish they could just "clock out"

[2023-01-03 23:59:47] <%+fionnualla> Disney's Animal Kingdom does a light show on the lake there because they can't/don't use fireworks there. It's an amazing show if you get the chance to see it. My friend was the lighting designer for it!
[2023-01-03 23:59:47] <%+simmerskye7> Fireworks are the worst!! They scare a lot of pets and wild animals. I‚Äôm in CA and they account for a pretty big chunk of fires every year. I‚Äôd love it if they were banned all together. My dog thinks fireworks are thunder‚Ä¶ which he is terrified of as well.
[2023-01-03 23:59:47] <alina7516> oh ppl can just do fireworks in the US? In canada, my city at least its just one event
