[2022-12-28 18:52:17] <@%Tinyfred> But you have to check on the stream
[2022-12-28 18:52:18] <%Sneakyxxrocket> Every other expansions he just tweets a worst meta ever tweet just routine
[2022-12-28 18:52:19] <EfficientRogue> @Apock13 hello priest player
[2022-12-28 18:52:26] <%mthd4s> actually its pretty visible on my 644hz monitor 🤓
[2022-12-28 18:52:27] <!%Carlthuzad> it's a pretty damn fast meta with a lot of decks you can't do anything against, so I get it.
[2022-12-28 18:52:29] <AlogisioS> the cam looks great

[2022-12-28 18:52:41] <Ath3risHispida> @FenoHS why almost every streamer is 2 or 3 digits now
[2022-12-28 18:52:41] <Apock13> @Apock13 hello, fuck you too
[2022-12-28 18:52:43] <@%Tinyfred> It's really not that bad, it's just like 30FPS instead of 60
[2022-12-28 18:52:44] <+graukatze> No FPS here
[2022-12-28 18:52:45] <+IcyRootBeer> hey @FenoHS who do you think would win a boxing match thijs or casper

[2022-12-28 18:53:12] <@%Tinyfred> It's fucking crazy how the meta got so stale not even a month after the expansion is released
[2022-12-28 18:53:15] <EfficientRogue> @Xeath5 you mean bless priest? isnt it kinda dead
[2022-12-28 18:53:17] <fatcatHS> also rank dosent matter right now for comp layers
[2022-12-28 18:53:18] <%+seandonjuan17> Fps might be capped so there isn’t a fluctuation in frames
[2022-12-28 18:53:22] <%FenoHS_Official> all streamers thrash OK
[2022-12-28 18:53:26] <!%Carlthuzad> I don't think the meta can truly refresh until the set rolls next year.  miniset won't help

[2022-12-28 18:54:30] <AlogisioS> he is a bit burnout
[2022-12-28 18:54:30] <violin2> They rolled him in the replies LUL

[2022-12-28 18:54:56] <%mthd4s> no meatmat decks in the meta sounds like a good meta to me ok
[2022-12-28 18:54:58] <%mthd4s> OK
[2022-12-28 18:54:59] <aendlessssssly> I like arcane mage and for my ranks its pretty wrong so…
[2022-12-28 18:54:59] <sir_wolfo> 6 mana 6/7 is right!
[2022-12-28 18:55:00] <Hachiibee> he just need a holdiday, like everyone else!

[2022-12-28 18:56:21] <%pykesensei> @fenohs you know who is complaining about the meta? Control players thats it
[2022-12-28 18:56:22] <TreTime> Metas need to change and evolve. If you played only aggro meta for 2 years you lose players same for aggro. So it flips to hold the greater player base attention. More players = happier Blizz
[2022-12-28 18:56:31] <%thegame___na> @FenoHS i love this meta. do you think they should remove the board? dragging burn spells across that much distance extends games too much for me
