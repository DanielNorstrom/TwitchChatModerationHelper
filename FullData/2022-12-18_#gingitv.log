[2022-12-18 23:48:23] <klenis> @magski94 probably gear difference, liquid has decent gear on their boomies
[2022-12-18 23:48:23] <@Echo_Esports> Echo's best percent on Mythic Broodkeeper Diurna is 3.95% after 34 pulls. warcraftlogs.com/rwf/echo
[2022-12-18 23:48:25] <evilconq> 4%
[2022-12-18 23:48:33] DELETED: Atzepengzz (Liquid IS in a bottle)
[2022-12-18 23:48:36] <+MrCatchy> this is it
[2022-12-18 23:48:49] <DeadBesidE> mage for int buff for boomkins SeemsGood
[2022-12-18 23:48:56] <+brainy23tmb> Echo boomies have less good gear than liquid they got unlucky
[2022-12-18 23:48:57] <deimousxoxo> what happened to the hardstyle pumper playlist
[2022-12-18 23:49:00] <+pakiemcd88> what addon has the talking countdown
[2022-12-18 23:49:13] <magski94> @justtrim ok, so the rest of Echo is doing more dps then, I assume? So the boomies at Echo dont have to do that High dpsü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
[2022-12-18 23:49:15] <thrasher1990> if you check combat timer at 2 min for example the boss % is 0.3% diffrence so singletarget is pretty much the same from both guilds
[2022-12-18 23:49:29] <%kellse921> is it mythic ?
[2022-12-18 23:49:42] <kugelschreiber_john> anybody knows the song?
