[2022-12-08 11:11:47] <%Taylor131313> cobalt farm was less bad than anticipated, but glad it's over
[2022-12-08 11:26:02] <%Wardrick7> you only did it now?
[2022-12-08 11:26:19] <%Taylor131313> yes, I was trying to delay it as much as possible TrollDespair
[2022-12-08 11:27:35] <%Wardrick7> meanwhile you did obsidian keys which is way more painful and longer xdd
[2022-12-08 11:27:45] <%Taylor131313> but 2 rewards Smadge
[2022-12-08 11:27:51] <%Taylor131313> 2 > 1 anniesWrite
[2022-12-08 11:28:07] <%Wardrick7> but 14x time wise LUL
[2022-12-08 11:28:12] <%Taylor131313> tbh I'm glad I did obsidian when I did it because they nerfed hyperspawns like the day after KEKW
[2022-12-08 11:28:17] <%Taylor131313> would've beeen much worse
[2022-12-08 11:29:17] <%Wardrick7> or you could just waited for this week and got free 9k+ rep this week for weeklies xdd
[2022-12-08 11:29:36] <%Taylor131313> I mean it's still 9k rep of what, 40k ish?
[2022-12-08 11:31:25] <%Wardrick7> probably, dont know max number but still faster than farming it and it didnt matter when you get items anyway
[2022-12-08 11:34:22] <%Taylor131313> 381 equipped anniesWrite
[2022-12-08 11:34:39] <%Taylor131313> I need to grab some trinkets from M0s though, it seems like WQ ones are actually dogwater
[2022-12-08 11:35:21] <%Wardrick7> wq ones are horrible, only rares can drop decent ones
[2022-12-08 11:35:48] <%Wardrick7> but does it really matter if you will replace them with m+ soon? no one will check your trinkets only ilvl
[2022-12-08 11:35:54] <%Taylor131313> they don't look bad on paper, like the crit proc one, but I assume they proc less
[2022-12-08 11:36:22] <%Taylor131313> I mean at this point I'm basically done for the week except trinkets and 4 rares per day LULW
[2022-12-08 11:36:36] <%Taylor131313> might as well
[2022-12-08 11:37:13] <%Wardrick7> instead level a healer alt for raids xdd
[2022-12-08 11:37:18] <%Taylor131313> healer NoThanks
[2022-12-08 11:37:48] <%Wardrick7> im actually doing that right now, just cba to grind all the gear on it as well LUL
[2022-12-08 11:37:49] <%Taylor131313> now I can trade every slot too, might help Annie with cloth stack if she's doing the M0s anniesWrite

[2022-12-08 11:40:10] <%Wardrick7> i dont even know if i will do mOs this week as i can only get 3 items which i will upgrade with renown and crafted soon anyways
[2022-12-08 11:40:14] <%Taylor131313> I've also randomly found a 372 BoE trinket in my bags pepeWTF I wonder if it sells
[2022-12-08 11:40:19] <%Taylor131313> up for 150k on the AH
[2022-12-08 11:41:29] <%Taylor131313> it's actually hilarious how I have 1 piece of M0 gear start of week 2 KEKW
[2022-12-08 11:41:42] <%Taylor131313> weirdest start of expansion gearing ever
[2022-12-08 11:41:57] <%Wardrick7> it is
[2022-12-08 11:43:01] <%Wardrick7> i missed on a lot of gear week 1 cause of it, expected m0 to be highest so did all the events before anniesSole

[2022-12-08 11:43:25] <%Taylor131313> I don't think anyone expected this to happen
[2022-12-08 11:45:12] <%Taylor131313> while farming cobalt rep I had enough +HP powers I got to 1.4m HP, one of the group was like "follow tank pls", and i was like, bitch have you seen my HP, I'm the tank now KEKW

[2022-12-08 12:54:07] <%Sne4ky79> the tcg mount?
[2022-12-08 12:54:22] <%NoName6834> YEP
[2022-12-08 12:55:03] <%Sne4ky79> i dont think that will happen for sometime since tcg feldrake was so recent
[2022-12-08 12:56:15] <%NoName6834> Smadge
[2022-12-08 12:58:07] <%Sne4ky79> interesting news yesterday about ms signing 10 years of cod with nintendo and steam but sony hasnt signed yet but it is to please the ftc and eu for the merger with activision for sure
[2022-12-08 13:01:03] <%Sne4ky79> i just think ms will have to give more for the deal to go through since ftc wants to sue ms
[2022-12-08 13:01:19] <%Wardrick7> cause sony already managed ms to increase this deal to 10y instead of 3 so why stop now, they want more
[2022-12-08 13:01:41] <%Wardrick7> managed to force*
[2022-12-08 13:01:54] <%Sne4ky79> sony 100% wants the deal to not go through
[2022-12-08 13:02:14] <%NoName6834> just give me a new socom Smadge
[2022-12-08 13:02:19] <%Wardrick7> of course, why have more competition
[2022-12-08 13:02:56] <%Sne4ky79> if sony dont sign it will make them look very bad in ftc and eu's pov
[2022-12-08 13:03:22] <%Sne4ky79> since they lobbied about not getting cod
[2022-12-08 13:03:44] <%Wardrick7> only if ftc and eu pushes sony to sign it
[2022-12-08 13:04:36] <%Wardrick7> they will probably sign it at the last moment when they will know they cant get more
[2022-12-08 13:04:55] <%Sne4ky79> not just that but sony dont want it to end on ganepass and their customers have to pay 70$
[2022-12-08 13:05:30] <%Sne4ky79> they could easily make it a ps+ thing if cod goes to gamepass
[2022-12-08 13:05:35] <%Wardrick7> YEP why make good deals for customers
[2022-12-08 13:06:02] <%Wardrick7> sony has outdated mindset but it makes sense considering their position in the market
[2022-12-08 13:06:19] <%Sne4ky79> sony in the end want customers to pay the $70
[2022-12-08 13:06:46] <%Wardrick7> sadly everyone is now increasing prices to 70$
[2022-12-08 13:06:55] <%Sne4ky79> ppl was not happy about mlb the show ending on gamepass
[2022-12-08 13:07:14] <%Sne4ky79> from the sony fan boys side
[2022-12-08 13:08:23] <%Wardrick7> getting on gamepass is way better for a game player base
[2022-12-08 13:08:25] <%NoName6834> I get recommended console war stuff a lot of twitter TrollDespair
[2022-12-08 13:08:26] <%Sne4ky79> or the yakuza series or persona 5
[2022-12-08 13:08:49] <%NoName6834> sad thing is they are all grown adults
[2022-12-08 13:09:02] <%Sne4ky79> i own it all consoles and a pc and i dont like the fan boy shit either
[2022-12-08 13:09:19] <%drzaius30> @NoName6834 is your twitter stuck in 2010 ? LUL
[2022-12-08 13:09:31] <%Sne4ky79> i just say have fun and play what you like
[2022-12-08 13:10:10] <%Wardrick7> i have ps5 and ps+, i buy new games and dont have gamepass but i know how much better it is LUL
[2022-12-08 13:11:30] <%Sne4ky79> i want a ps5 and its difficult to get
[2022-12-08 13:11:45] <%Wardrick7> YEP i got really lucky to get a good deal
[2022-12-08 13:12:17] <%Sne4ky79> i have gamepass ultimate for my pc and xbox and its has great value
[2022-12-08 13:12:27] <%drzaius30> Same thank god for daylight saving fooling everyone Saved
[2022-12-08 13:12:40] <%NoName6834> easy to get them in murica now
[2022-12-08 13:12:41] <%Wardrick7> being a fanboy of any company is a bad thing, they care about money, not us, so we should only treat them like a service provider
[2022-12-08 13:13:26] <%Sne4ky79> 100% @wardrick7
[2022-12-08 13:13:34] <%NoName6834> just checked walmart website and ragnorock bundle available for normal asking price
[2022-12-08 13:13:59] <%drzaius30> its the Us
[2022-12-08 13:14:00] <%Wardrick7> i constantly get emails from sony to exclusively preorder ps5 in USA now, if only i lived there LUL
[2022-12-08 13:14:21] <%drzaius30> it sees the bulk of the consoles manufactured
[2022-12-08 13:14:51] <%NoName6834> yeah but they were still hard to get here until recently
[2022-12-08 13:15:01] <%drzaius30> for individual countries you have to camp out websites the second they drop to pre order
[2022-12-08 13:15:07] <%NoName6834> so things are getting better
[2022-12-08 13:15:37] <%Sne4ky79> its like 760‚Ç¨ if lucky to get one here
[2022-12-08 13:16:19] <%NoName6834> everyone outside the US got a price increase anniesSole
[2022-12-08 13:16:34] <%Wardrick7> one shop here sells it for normal price 500eur, im still in waitlist and i signed 2y ago LUL
[2022-12-08 13:16:47] <%drzaius30> that too i finally get a console right after the price increase

[2022-12-08 14:02:16] [Raid] 4 raiders from Terrath12 have joined!
[2022-12-08 14:02:25] <+Razzin_> Sire was killable week 1, but Generals took way too long
[2022-12-08 14:02:31] <%Taylor131313> I think the only long RWF outside of Sepulcher in the last expansion was ToS, but that was only because Avatar and KJ were insanely bugged and overtuned @AnnieFuchsia

[2022-12-08 14:02:43] <jeaunoo> guys dont be losers

[2022-12-08 17:07:00] <+goldiesoulo> they should hire a seperate team of devs that specialize on fixing their fuckups for the current expansion
[2022-12-08 17:07:00] <%Collnaris> sounds like they are planning too far ahead in advance where it affects the present game
[2022-12-08 17:07:16] <%$LegendTater> makes sense, then gutting it and redoing things takes a lot of time and material

[2022-12-08 17:08:25] <whiskeyjack03> i get that theere couldn't be quick, massive overhauls to the systems, but what i'll never forgive them for is the horrible tuning and refusal to implement quick fixes on things. it took them over a damn year to remove conduit energy.
[2022-12-08 17:08:26] <DeathEggTV> @MuenCheese, this isn't entirely true. Software does take a very long time, but you can build a process and system in such a way that it can respond to feedback quickly. There are exceptions, and something like an entire AP system IS an exception. Too many things were tied into that to change it quickly. However, the way things are built right now in Dragonflight APPEAR to be built in a way that they can be changed and iterated upon much more quickly.
[2022-12-08 17:08:30] <%Jandoodle12> Tbf at this point wow gamers don‚Äôt give a shiit about the storyline we want something to play MingLee
[2022-12-08 17:08:30] <%+anselt_> @AnnieFuchsia sorry but tahts such a bullshit answer. the systems are almost never the problem but the way of aquiring them. why do we need for years to wait on the x.3 patch so fix things that could be fixed in beta like determined legendary acquisition, alt friendlyness, switching  covenants and so on

[2022-12-08 17:09:36] <+goldiesoulo> modular is like being able to change parts in a structure or thing
[2022-12-08 17:09:40] <+3clips3> Keep the underlying structure and change the dreesing
[2022-12-08 17:09:42] <%BenchmarkCAD> its a rly good xpac so far
[2022-12-08 17:09:50] <%BenchmarkCAD> all the dungeons are awesome
[2022-12-08 17:09:52] <DeathEggTV> TLDR for my paragraph: AP system too hard to change quick, DF systems easier to change quick
[2022-12-08 17:09:57] <polygoncoke> @enoz___ right, but again, there is not only alts, but also offspec. Being locked out from so much content by the amount of time you‚Äôre able to put in to grinding isn‚Äôt fun
[2022-12-08 17:10:01] <DankWizard420> @Alastor7783 modular design works IF the overarching thinking is there, but if the theory is pissweak liek it was in bfa it falls apart KEKW

[2022-12-08 17:59:02] <%drzaius30> That was the reason Preach stated he was so frustrated
[2022-12-08 17:59:03] <+Altis_the_Spheal> It was very mixed, there was oh this is better than BFA, first week was fun, etc but also "here are all these looming awful problems"
[2022-12-08 17:59:05] <redmyst_> They complained about that, but the raid tier and overall content was still very praised early on
[2022-12-08 17:59:07] <%Sne4ky79> anniesHmm
[2022-12-08 17:59:07] <%Collnaris> i hated the maw super fast
[2022-12-08 17:59:08] <Vancouver24> I heard nothing good about it at least, which is why I never played it
[2022-12-08 17:59:08] <%+GibsonSWE> Preach was shouting about Covenants in Beta
[2022-12-08 17:59:08] <%Mirkooo> I liked season 1 Sadge
[2022-12-08 17:59:10] <%Enoz___> I never thought SL was great....
[2022-12-08 17:59:11] <+super_fofa> yes, they talk about the covenant system
[2022-12-08 17:59:12] <%Makkan780> the raid was good but tahts about it
[2022-12-08 17:59:16] <%Taylor131313> ^
[2022-12-08 17:59:16] <%+Thoreya> s1 was good
[2022-12-08 17:59:17] <+Alarius_> it was NOT great
[2022-12-08 17:59:23] <+Pipin90> @treyjh are you really sure about that? I remember I saw graphics on bellular channel about how shadowlands delayed a lot the "usual" times, there are never like... patch every 3 months or something, every patch has different timings
[2022-12-08 17:59:24] <%Taylor131313> raid was good, everything else really wasn't
[2022-12-08 17:59:24] <dotbmp> i almost gave up shadowlands when it came out, lasted a few weeks and then i did drop off until like a week or two ago
[2022-12-08 17:59:25] <%+Thoreya> asmon liked s1, he tweeted it too lol
[2022-12-08 17:59:26] <%bYTEfROG> I knew when we couldn't use mounts in the maw that something wasn't right

[2022-12-08 17:59:41] <%Enoz___> Preach was positive about torghast in Alpha, then they changed it to worse in beta. and from the beginning covenants was bad...

[2022-12-08 17:59:53] <%drzaius30> BLUBBERS
[2022-12-08 17:59:53] <%Turbopumper> asmon was positive over there not being an infinite grind like azerite power
[2022-12-08 17:59:59] <%Makkan780> collecting was terrible in SL
[2022-12-08 18:00:06] <%NoName6834> 6pm anniesDinkDonk gonna be late

[2022-12-08 18:00:58] <%Mirkooo> Warriors too weak since beta Smadge
[2022-12-08 18:00:58] <polygoncoke> Yeah the game is buggy now for real. Has been since prepatch.
[2022-12-08 18:01:06] <%Collnaris> that's why i was surprised when i saw the tweets from some people that SL was praised at the beginning of expansion
[2022-12-08 18:01:09] <+Pipin90> they said they "did not ignored" the feedback, but they said they couldn't do changes because "expansion features" lol
[2022-12-08 18:01:12] <dotbmp> maybe one day druids will get love *sulks* :P
