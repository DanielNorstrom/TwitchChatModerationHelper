[2022-12-07 00:31:47] <uknowmep> Caribou are a type of deer, and therefore their meat is edible. People have traditionally relied on caribou as a major food source, as the meat can be eaten raw, frozen, aged, roasted, dried, or made into jerky, sausage, roasts, and STEAKS.

[2022-12-07 01:11:23] <drzero7> nuzzle is better then thunder wave, thunder wave is 90% nuzzle is 100%

[2022-12-07 22:17:14] <%+alice_in_technoland> @DraconicWings I'd be a idiot. My autism has allowed me to learn SO MANY THINGS.
[2022-12-07 22:17:17] <%Spikee439> Haruka...how did you build self-confidence?
[2022-12-07 22:17:20] <+cubbywolf> would you be the same if you could understand stuff better though?
[2022-12-07 22:17:21] <ItsKatsuragi> yeah, turns out that while im sort of a asshole at times, because I don't have the patience for "normal", people still gravitate and turn to me all the time because I'm usually the problem solver... and deep down a nice guy
[2022-12-07 22:17:36] <%+alice_in_technoland> @ItsKatsuragi yeah same
[2022-12-07 22:17:38] <+Eccentrigamer> I mean it doesn't change your personality, just how your brain functions and perceives things
[2022-12-07 22:17:38] <+cubbywolf> I see
[2022-12-07 22:17:39] <%Dovakin_bb> bruh i hated this track almost as much as rainbow road

[2022-12-07 22:17:44] <%sara_llewellyn> But you figure - the negative experience also shaped who you became today, right?
[2022-12-07 22:17:45] <WillBillTheAspyRebel> I love this track.
[2022-12-07 22:17:49] <mikeygonzales> So Excuse me  I Strongly love being around my Vshojo Degen waifus Vtubers 24/7 so It's  my choice to be Who I am
[2022-12-07 22:17:51] <%comicjaguar29> I‚Äôm not know
[2022-12-07 22:17:52] <+NurgleVT> i guess it all about  the spectrum , autism isn't binary so who knows
[2022-12-07 22:17:57] <%+Izanagi21> But the struggles define what you experience and who you are is built of those... you probably wouldn't be
[2022-12-07 22:18:04] <$MrLvHelmuts> @HarukaKaribu  Even many normal peapl Dont' understand eatch other
[2022-12-07 22:18:12] <+cubbywolf> I dont think understanding people is easy
[2022-12-07 22:18:13] <%comicjaguar29> Yep
[2022-12-07 22:18:15] <mikeygonzales> So I'M NOT perfect
[2022-12-07 22:18:17] <Drkness88> agreed
[2022-12-07 22:18:17] <%+PeachHana> its really hard to learn not to mask
[2022-12-07 22:18:18] <CthulianDreams> Man, I can't understand most people at all.
[2022-12-07 22:18:18] <MetsuTeras> Ralatable
[2022-12-07 22:18:25] <%+historynerd1990> Does not have to be I have Aspeger. The so called "high functioning autism" I can learn well etc, but emotions can still be dificult. I either emphasize too much or not at all
[2022-12-07 22:18:26] <+cubbywolf> my mask excludes me Sadge
[2022-12-07 22:18:28] <arbiter58> I have to do the same with anxiety/depression
[2022-12-07 22:18:29] <OriginalHamsta> I didn't get my documented diagnosis until my early 20s, but I still struggle with it.  I'm working on being more outgoing with others, even though I've accepted there will be things that I will never fundamentally understand.
[2022-12-07 22:18:30] <Desteroyah> Fair, I'm HSP and very likely on an ADD/ADHD spectrum. I'd say without them I'd be the same guy, maybe I'd handle stressful situations better.
[2022-12-07 22:18:31] <WillBillTheAspyRebel> Even my ASD makes it harder for me to think.

[2022-12-07 22:19:16] <%$schneckenhof42> Its incredibly hard to tell where the mask begins or ends when you've been wearing one since you were 6.
[2022-12-07 22:19:17] <%merefire> honestly people say the same thing to me when i tell them i'm on the spectrum
[2022-12-07 22:19:22] <+cubbywolf> I've borrowed that trick
[2022-12-07 22:19:25] <%supersonic407> Yeah, that seems likr a common reaction from people who find out you're autistic, but yes I agree! Definitely a compliment for sure!
[2022-12-07 22:19:26] <%$schneckenhof42> OMG you do the Bridge of the Nose thing too?
[2022-12-07 22:19:26] <%kyulen742> i've been trying to unmask lately and it's hard, and people don't know why I'm different but they can still tell

[2022-12-07 22:20:11] <SeyrenFreyrOfTheAria> To be honest. Everyone has a mask (I know it isn't the same thing exactly) but many people hide one thing or another about themselves to basically avoid ostracization.

[2022-12-07 22:20:25] <%TheFoodcartGamer> I wasn't diagnosed as autistic, dyslexic, adhd etc until I was an adult. I had always masked it, dealt with it. When I was finally given some tools to deal with it life made so much more sense
[2022-12-07 22:20:26] <%NimaPode> stimulation, expressing through motion
[2022-12-07 22:20:26] <%$JonCipher> @HarukaKaribu As a person with autism, I have been bullied because of my autism and later OCD/anxiety. But I got friends, family, and good people to support me.

[2022-12-07 22:21:08] <WackyTJ99> It‚Äôs kinda like constant movement of your body
[2022-12-07 22:21:09] <MetsuTeras> Oh I do that when nervous, concentrating or agitated
[2022-12-07 22:21:09] <%+TheVerySeriousLewis> I was misdiagnosed as a kid so I didn't even know I was on the spectrum
[2022-12-07 22:21:09] <+cubbywolf> its a nervous body tick, like leg vibrating
[2022-12-07 22:21:09] <ichigo1692> @HarukaKaribu Europe is better with Autism than us, which is sad because with "diversity" we have a long way to go XD
[2022-12-07 22:21:09] <+Eccentrigamer> Oh is that what that's called? I didn't know there was a word for it.

[2022-12-07 22:21:18] <%Spikee439> like a nervous tick?
[2022-12-07 22:21:19] <%+Izanagi21> Stimming:  your brain needs something to distract itself, so you do something

[2022-12-07 22:21:22] <%+SuzakuAndEoh> Requiring something (an action or object) to keep one's mental composure, maybe?
[2022-12-07 22:21:22] <%Dovakin_bb> kinda a way of expression when being excited maybe?

[2022-12-07 22:21:23] <+skeletoncow5> I always describe it as self-stimulation, like moving around or fidgeting
[2022-12-07 22:21:23] <Kittymonic> It's like repetitive movements or noises !
[2022-12-07 22:21:24] <Seymour5271> for me I feel like I have to move some part of my body

[2022-12-07 22:21:30] <HibariOzoraYKZA> stimulation to take the focus off of something else
[2022-12-07 22:21:30] <%+HyridianXXVI> Stimming is like doing a stimulating action, whether it be moving around or making a noise i think
[2022-12-07 22:21:33] <%Minanonn> Repeated motions (usually) as a response to stimuli?

[2022-12-07 22:21:36] <CthulianDreams> Similar to fidgeting, but slightly compulsive and comforting
