[2022-12-08 03:50:42] <%$Arty_chan> Vodka is very on character haha
[2022-12-08 03:50:45] <%mister_mugen> when I was a student I'd just mix vodka and OJ on budget for screwdrivers
[2022-12-08 03:50:50] <whitegorilla98> vodka tastes bad and only good as a premix
[2022-12-08 03:51:01] <%Fis216> i still have almost full bottle of vodka i got gifted when i moved apartments
[2022-12-08 03:51:07] <+Yronno> Vodka is good on its own, depending on brand
[2022-12-08 03:51:08] <Ahhhnon42069> @Sleepy_Project if you don't spend money on alcohol you could have more money for guns lol

[2022-12-08 03:52:23] <%slackerlate> you mix that vodka with anything??
[2022-12-08 03:52:25] <%mister_mugen> I only drink in restaurants if they have a meme drink like tar beer or something

[2022-12-08 10:11:46] <%malicious_eagle> I think the current meta is 7.62 BP since it doesn't degrade the gun durability and the cost is cheaper
[2022-12-08 10:11:49] <VeryTricky> ks23 has a neat history

[2022-12-08 10:27:07] <CirnoPower> @Hanzax not anymore. According to new amendments, paradox and lancaster barrels are considered rifled, so a gun needs to have absolutely straight and smooth barrel to be considered a shotgun
