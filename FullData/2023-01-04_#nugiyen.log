[2023-01-04 14:00:19] <+klone_iron_fist> It's almost a little similar to speed running. Because of game changes you can't beat the old times which I think it's overall good for the game, but it kills the will to race for a worse time.

[2023-01-04 15:33:02] <AlDaBest> The mandatory grace/deter is what annoys me the most. Often forced into aura stacking from there on
[2023-01-04 15:33:08] <@%+DetholeX> thinking about playing some chill stellaris

[2023-01-04 15:33:48] <%+sgtkami> Its like oh you wanna make a build that needs an aura for damage? Better go get an ashes or it wont work
[2023-01-04 15:34:01] <ADevelopment> I don't think so. I was feeling really pleased with myself for coming up with my own builds recently and then i looked into it properly and realised I'm not better, the game is just imo, dumbed down Sadge

[2023-01-04 15:34:02] <snc_teibegreez> @Vosy1984 me too, phys taken as ele is ok with a lot of evasion and no armour
[2023-01-04 15:34:18] <+fridim94> a Support gem that covert mana reservation into a mana degen could fix mana builds
[2023-01-04 15:34:21] <%Enttick> is max block still a thing?
[2023-01-04 15:34:33] <@%+DetholeX> myth isn't it the game a viewer here developed?
[2023-01-04 15:34:42] <%Vosy1984> @snc_teibegreez yea, and ghost shrouds is very good as well if you build a lot of ES

[2023-01-04 15:35:54] <Shatraugh> i mean its just a campaign, new ascendancies etc.. I dont think defences will change in anyway for example in the end

[2023-01-04 15:36:23] <!%+Myth82> also i should go back to lost epoch. game got alot new stuff sicne i played it
[2023-01-04 15:36:54] <ADevelopment> i mean my secret hope is that sanctum guards were an example of a type of interactive combat we get in poe 2 - that would allow for completely different defences
[2023-01-04 15:37:03] <!%+Myth82> Vosy1984 lost epoch and last ark OpieOP
[2023-01-04 15:37:04] <GoldenRetr> honestly it does kinda sux, evey build i play i just "have" to use determ and/or grace, and even if i want to play MoM it too much to give up in terms of aura and damage mods just to stack mana for the sake of mana
[2023-01-04 15:37:26] <%Vosy1984> @Myth82 start finding stuff, sir, we cannot have all these lost games roaming around

[2023-01-04 15:38:36] <%Enttick> I wonder how they will change the endgame for PoE2. The new campaign system looks good already
[2023-01-04 15:38:43] <+fridim94> i liked dodge a lot more
[2023-01-04 15:38:56] <%Vosy1984> @Enttick they already said the end game will be the same

[2023-01-04 15:44:37] <ADevelopment> i have to admit, when GGG had put in the whole grace+defiance banner system, following nerfs+influence items being hammered, I thought the auras were just a stopgap measure

[2023-01-04 16:05:06] <alfietects> Okay Elden Ring !!!
[2023-01-04 16:05:06] <%Vosy1984> challenges are really fun @nugiyen
[2023-01-04 16:05:07] <snc_teibegreez> I don't mind other people like it
[2023-01-04 16:05:17] <+IndoorTobi> @snc_teibegreez what is LE ?
[2023-01-04 16:05:20] <@%Andrew756> they are not fun this league
[2023-01-04 16:05:21] <%Lazzius> I see what you mean. Thanks for clarifying, PoE is a very harsh competition that's for sure for other ARPGS.
[2023-01-04 16:05:41] <+CoffeePoE> i never even look at the challenges in the league until i'm kinda done with the league
[2023-01-04 16:05:47] <DuckWho> I tried new Ritual nodes last night and I think I got addicted to deferring things LUL
[2023-01-04 16:05:58] VIEWERS: 523
[2023-01-04 16:06:03] <lStarkx> Yeah PoE has just too much already, so hard for other arpgs to to compete
[2023-01-04 16:06:11] <%ampdecay> they just different kinds of games, you can play both
[2023-01-04 16:06:14] <lStarkx> But some people hate there is so much to it tbh
[2023-01-04 16:06:15] <ChomskysGaming> being a different game is enough
[2023-01-04 16:06:23] <%Lazzius> I play Project Diablo 2, Grim Dawn, Last Epoch, PoE... don't regret any of em.
[2023-01-04 16:06:24] <%ampdecay> of course both ARPGs but different styles
[2023-01-04 16:06:40] <%ampdecay> I like the time travel aspect of it
[2023-01-04 16:06:45] <%Lazzius> It's very nice to analyze different ARPGS
[2023-01-04 16:06:48] <%Lazzius> and experience them
[2023-01-04 16:06:53] <alfietects> Poe far from perfect lol
[2023-01-04 16:06:53] <ADevelopment> it's possible to positive about one game without being negative about others YEP
[2023-01-04 16:07:04] <alfietects> But I see what you mean
[2023-01-04 16:07:25] <MFEpicOne> sounds like a u problem

[2023-01-04 16:08:02] <ChomskysGaming> at the end of the day, theyre just video games, any reasons are valid to play them
[2023-01-04 16:08:20] <snc_teibegreez> I don't regret playing lost epoch at all. it was fine, pleayed through a few times. It's just if I want to play some ARPG, i load up POE rather than LE
[2023-01-04 16:08:20] <GoldenRetr> to be honest if poe did not have new leagues, i would not play it
[2023-01-04 16:08:54] <alfietects> Yeah of course itâ€™s the reset and new league mechanics which keeps people playing poe
[2023-01-04 16:08:58] <@%QuackSage> done something about your internet connection?
[2023-01-04 16:09:15] <ADevelopment> trade or ssf next league? hc trade actually had traffic this league

[2023-01-04 16:11:07] <lStarkx> Why is vaal smite so good but vaal cleave so garbo tho, idk why they hate cleave so much
[2023-01-04 16:11:10] <alfietects> Sounds basically like HC trade to me lol

[2023-01-04 16:12:50] <Synthetic37> One of the most interesting things for giga tank is the mageblood at home setup with Progenisis imo but that doesnt seem feasable in ssf
[2023-01-04 16:13:09] <alfietects> What you mean?
[2023-01-04 16:13:55] <%MrBonkeyDollax> I enjoy the challenges and playing 3 or 4 builds each league. Challs get me to engage with content I might have ignored in the previous leagues

[2023-01-04 16:14:41] <+CoffeePoE> I think a lot of that is lack of meta shakeup tbh
[2023-01-04 16:14:55] <%+MrVonDutchman> its a waiting game for poe2

[2023-01-04 16:16:12] <ADevelopment> the best bit is when you build an interesting defence system people assume you're clueless because you're not using the standard generic stuff KEKW
[2023-01-04 16:16:32] <%Enttick> wish we would have other goals than just bosses. Feels like they tried with delve but it turned out meh
[2023-01-04 16:16:40] <alfietects> Nah add new defence for all areas of the tree imo
[2023-01-04 16:16:49] <Synthetic37> I wish they didn't completely murder omeocan's

[2023-01-04 16:28:32] <+CoffeePoE> I think the chase uniques are fine, as long as they quit designing content that basically requires that power level
