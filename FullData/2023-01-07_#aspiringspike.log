[2023-01-07 17:05:29] <mrfringe89> @aspiringspike probably still in the adjustment phase. but in the retriever deck. would adding a needle for sideboard and adding the instant that destroys a enchantment or artifact and gains the controller 4 life in addition to the mite be good as hate starts to come in? maybe dismember if collecter oof sees play.

[2023-01-07 18:55:55] <%UnimpressedInfernape> i think the only way i could enjoy a souls game is if i tried to learn to speed run it
[2023-01-07 18:55:55] <MindGameArcade> "Slow & Methodical" is an actual rule in WH40K you should look it up lol

[2023-01-07 19:27:15] <Noobiesnack> there really isn't a wrong way to draft cube
[2023-01-07 19:27:22] <Cardplayerwell> I think in vintage cube it becomes less removal and more answers which is a bit more vague
[2023-01-07 19:27:25] <%mcclint> BREAD is stale in Cube
[2023-01-07 19:27:33] <ozkantheflip> 1-mana removal is a premium in cube
[2023-01-07 19:27:35] <%yallz> what even is the a in bread?
[2023-01-07 19:27:39] <%Aper_MtG> also bread doesn't work anymore because all the text on new cards
[2023-01-07 19:27:41] <%$Ocara115> I just force storm or reanimator every time
[2023-01-07 19:27:42] <%+codemasterz> I do think that cube has gotten more aggressive creatures that demand some level of answer at times

[2023-01-07 19:27:49] <ZamGGief> @trans1uc3nt BREAD has always been bad because B could mean anything that READ doesnt deal well with. It's the same as saying "Pick the good cards"
[2023-01-07 19:27:50] <%mcclint> A is for Anti-hero cards
[2023-01-07 19:28:01] <+kynsareth> BREAD is great for standard draft, but when every card is a bomb it's hard to just heuristics it out
[2023-01-07 19:28:03] <%+ElevationAV> @yallz aggro
[2023-01-07 19:28:06] <%+jpfeinberg> the real removal is the friends we make along the way

[2023-01-07 19:28:58] <ozkantheflip> in cube you also just have a higher winrate by drafting what youre comfy with
[2023-01-07 19:29:03] <Vulfe> putrid imp is giga medium in cube, so reluctant to take it lol
[2023-01-07 19:29:06] <%Aper_MtG> we already have a 1 mana recursive discard outlet @aspiringspike
[2023-01-07 19:29:08] <%dannyprather> The card I‚Äôve been most impressed with in cube has been sheoldred. So many applications

[2023-01-07 19:30:42] <%+Avinan> If you‚Äôre new to the cube lean towards Mono W and Mono R. They‚Äôre straightforward, powerful, and are good vs most decks in the cube

[2023-01-07 19:30:58] <andreashc13> my only rule i try to follow is to never force something and stay open during the first pack
[2023-01-07 19:30:58] <MindGameArcade> you need to know the archetypes in vintage cube otherwise you'll have no clue what to pick sometimes

[2023-01-07 19:31:27] <%ish_the_dragon> I am a huge fan of Cheons in Vintage Cube
[2023-01-07 19:31:42] <ozkantheflip> @MindGameArcade not really, the macro archetypes of aggro, midrange, and control are all supported and you can draft those without knowledge of any microarchetype
[2023-01-07 19:31:46] <+Swivle_> reanimator x dark depths seems like good crossover
[2023-01-07 19:31:51] <%maxwread> UW Control is the hardest to draft and play tho
[2023-01-07 19:32:02] <pillageisking> I like the Finkel approach
[2023-01-07 19:32:05] <@%n0b34ts> I would strongly suggest you do not just draft a mono color like red or white without still doing your research. If those decks don't have the right cards, and you aren't competent enough to recognize what those cards are, it will be a miserable play experience.
[2023-01-07 19:32:15] <%+TurnPikeBear> Mono white is usually open and honestly one of the strongest
[2023-01-07 19:32:18] <MindGameArcade> nah I don't agree, I have a lot of trophies and I think basic midrange decks that typically work will fail you miserably in vintage cube @ozkantheflip
[2023-01-07 19:32:19] <+flaannigan> Hey spike. I‚Äôm having trouble choosing a new modern deck. Any suggestions? Haven‚Äôt had a deck since your rakdos mud with lurrus.

[2023-01-07 19:39:56] <maletintohs> elesh?
[2023-01-07 19:40:00] <%+tyler01924> Foothills wheeling is insane
[2023-01-07 19:40:01] <+kentuckyfri3d> lili?
[2023-01-07 19:40:08] <MindGameArcade> nooo
[2023-01-07 19:40:13] <Vulfe> primus is probably better
[2023-01-07 19:40:14] <+puntcity> I prefer primus
[2023-01-07 19:40:14] <beagle_ow> norn is busted imo
[2023-01-07 19:40:16] <ozkantheflip> elesh norn is really good against some matchups
[2023-01-07 19:40:17] <MindGameArcade> foothills all day

[2023-01-07 19:40:50] <@%+hmmyespanda> but mono r and w are the best decks in the format
[2023-01-07 19:40:55] <rowrow_> one entomb from glory
[2023-01-07 19:41:01] <+KrisjanisWL> 8 drop tribal
[2023-01-07 19:41:03] <+Ainvar87> Archon
[2023-01-07 19:41:04] <msoly55> give us entomb, demonic tutor, vampiric tutor
[2023-01-07 19:41:10] <%+devoncoltrane> griselbrand is not very good against mono white usually. a good mono white deck has a pile of exile effects
[2023-01-07 19:41:17] VIEWERS: 1¬†167
[2023-01-07 19:41:20] <MindGameArcade> thoughtseize is good too
[2023-01-07 19:41:31] <%maxwread> archon of cruelty
[2023-01-07 19:41:36] <msoly55> what about Bazaar o' Baghdadi?
[2023-01-07 19:41:42] <%+scurtis9> how many reanimate targets do you reccomend?
[2023-01-07 19:41:56] <scoutertf2> *shuffle shuffle shuffle*
[2023-01-07 19:41:57] <%+youreinnate> woudl you take entomb over ancestral rn?
[2023-01-07 19:41:59] <@%n0b34ts> Archon likely to wheel at this table. I think Entomb might not actually wheel.
[2023-01-07 19:42:00] <msoly55> oh yeah - i hate it, but late it would be deec.
[2023-01-07 19:42:12] <MindGameArcade> & crazy storms player
[2023-01-07 19:42:24] <ozkantheflip> bazaar is often bad even unless you're very all in on a busted reanimator deck
[2023-01-07 19:42:38] <+PunpkinQueen> bazaar is kind of a bizarre card to take in any other deck
[2023-01-07 19:42:39] <rowrow_> chupa is interaction, we're fine on acceleration
[2023-01-07 19:42:40] <MindGameArcade> chupa is good
[2023-01-07 19:42:43] <MindGameArcade> to beat aggro
[2023-01-07 19:43:06] <Vulfe> reanimator is good against decks without counterspells
[2023-01-07 19:43:09] <%$AnonymousSezz> soup or salad? choop or chalice
[2023-01-07 19:43:12] <+Ainvar87> Did we see recurring nightmare?
[2023-01-07 19:43:17] VIEWERS: 1¬†167
[2023-01-07 19:43:27] <msoly55> recurring nightmare wouldnt be that great - we don't have little things really to combo with it
[2023-01-07 19:43:28] <@%n0b34ts> @aspiringspike Did you take Woe Strider?
[2023-01-07 19:43:28] <MindGameArcade> no
[2023-01-07 19:43:34] <Vulfe> lurrus + recurring nightmare? :eyes:
[2023-01-07 19:44:02] <maletintohs> Would be nice get an urborg
[2023-01-07 19:44:18] <Vulfe> probably worse than mes fiend
[2023-01-07 19:44:20] <Vulfe> idk
[2023-01-07 19:44:24] <%+youreinnate> fiend might be better
[2023-01-07 19:44:24] <MindGameArcade> mesmeric fiend is nice also yeah
[2023-01-07 19:44:26] <pillageisking> fiend
[2023-01-07 19:44:27] <+GiglioMTG> passing stp sadge
[2023-01-07 19:44:27] <ozkantheflip> alright the chup is a lot better if we draft recurring xd
[2023-01-07 19:44:33] <@%n0b34ts> Fiend will wheel.
[2023-01-07 19:44:34] <maletintohs> we can take fiend
[2023-01-07 19:44:53] <+DoneTheMath> Got Chupacabra in the board for nightmare
[2023-01-07 19:44:54] <maletintohs> Thought is the pick prob
[2023-01-07 19:44:55] <MantisMind> totzy
[2023-01-07 19:44:58] <msoly55> thoughtseize is probably the best pick
[2023-01-07 19:44:58] <+puntcity> Chupacabra is good now
[2023-01-07 19:45:01] <@%n0b34ts> Splash for White, nothing beats Palace Jailer.
[2023-01-07 19:45:03] <msoly55> you're not really a big mana deck.
[2023-01-07 19:45:03] <MindGameArcade> toughtseize yeah
[2023-01-07 19:45:05] <rowrow_> discard is important
[2023-01-07 19:45:07] <+gambledoor> thoughtseize
[2023-01-07 19:45:11] <+gambledoor> !
[2023-01-07 19:45:11] <ozkantheflip> thoughtseize is soooo good tho
[2023-01-07 19:45:16] <%+devoncoltrane> yawg will could wheel, tseize never will
[2023-01-07 19:45:17] <%+ElevationAV> chup and strider are much better with the nightmare

[2023-01-07 19:45:34] <msoly55> Peatland or Copter - or Grave Titan
[2023-01-07 19:45:34] <MantisMind> self totzy ftw
[2023-01-07 19:45:38] <ozkantheflip> Grave Titan is reanimate target and very castable
[2023-01-07 19:45:42] <+gambledoor> grave
[2023-01-07 19:45:42] <rowrow_> not enough ways to crew
[2023-01-07 19:45:47] <@%n0b34ts> Copter solid pick, Titan maybe wheel.
[2023-01-07 19:45:47] <Marc_otato> abrade?
[2023-01-07 19:45:58] <%+thelittledonnie> Copter is very underrated

[2023-01-07 19:46:32] <ozkantheflip> @thelittledonnie lol i really dont think so, anyone that drafts regularly knows copter is busted. it was on LSVs top50
[2023-01-07 19:46:35] <MindGameArcade> LOL the storm player in all of us
[2023-01-07 19:46:47] <MindGameArcade> boring snuff out spike you know it

[2023-01-07 19:47:40] <rowrow_> taps for blue and green with urza/emeria

[2023-01-07 19:48:12] <+Elipsises> no respect
[2023-01-07 19:48:17] <msoly55> i flipped Darksteel Colossus to Dark Confidant playing Vintage back in the day WAY too many times
[2023-01-07 19:48:19] <Thwart_> Remove Canal
[2023-01-07 19:48:28] <rowrow_> bob is a synergy with griselbrand because he has lifelink HahaThink
[2023-01-07 19:48:29] <MindGameArcade> dark confidant turn 1 was crack though
[2023-01-07 19:48:39] <rowrow_> value ghast

[2023-01-07 19:49:37] <MindGameArcade> in draft so many times the opp stumbles for a couple turns & having bob early feels like you won @ozkantheflip I love it
[2023-01-07 19:49:39] <Shadowless10> worm is a decent elesh replacement
[2023-01-07 19:49:49] <%+thelittledonnie> I love the sneaky depths in this deck.
[2023-01-07 19:49:58] <rowrow_> petal is fixing and technically synergy with lurrus

[2023-01-07 19:50:07] <%+devoncoltrane> petal is probably still good with the depths plan

[2023-01-07 19:50:15] <%pewpew444> mind twist still seems good here

[2023-01-07 19:50:36] <msoly55> Oona's Prowler as another discard outlet that crews.
[2023-01-07 19:50:44] <maletintohs> Prowler
[2023-01-07 19:50:47] <maletintohs> discard copter
[2023-01-07 19:50:56] <rowrow_> oona's is worse if you have exhume as one of your spells
[2023-01-07 19:51:06] <+kentuckyfri3d> cryptbreaker wins games
[2023-01-07 19:51:11] <ozkantheflip> personally never been a fan of cryptbreaker in the cube
[2023-01-07 19:51:17] <MindGameArcade> it's too slow
[2023-01-07 19:51:17] <msoly55> do we cut the hexmage depths combo and go striaght into reanimator since depths is otherwise blank?
[2023-01-07 19:51:18] <@%n0b34ts> I think you can actually drop Wheel of Fortune.

[2023-01-07 19:51:45] <%+bjkbsmith> Yes
[2023-01-07 19:51:47] <+kentuckyfri3d> mind twist got powercrept

[2023-01-07 19:51:51] <%maxwread> yeah its random
[2023-01-07 19:51:51] <rowrow_> I'd cut prowler over twist, but you might need to cut both
[2023-01-07 19:51:52] <bbolter225> wheel of fortune is kinda bad?
[2023-01-07 19:51:52] <Vulfe> you also have dark ritual
[2023-01-07 19:51:54] <MindGameArcade> I don't know if wheel of fortune makes sense in this deck
[2023-01-07 19:51:55] <!phlyp84> smugglers copter doesnt have many enablers
[2023-01-07 19:51:57] <+wendi_witcch> it just has very low synergy in a high synergy needs deck
[2023-01-07 19:51:59] <@%n0b34ts> Someone at this table has Hymn and Sheoldred, but isn't drafting black.
[2023-01-07 19:51:59] <Matte8pt> i really dont think mind twist can be bad
[2023-01-07 19:52:14] <scoutertf2> cut the depths comob?
[2023-01-07 19:52:15] <ozkantheflip> cut wheel of fortune IMO
[2023-01-07 19:52:16] <%+youreinnate> is wheel good?

[2023-01-07 19:52:38] <%+thelittledonnie> I'd cut wheel over depths
[2023-01-07 19:52:38] <darkNukleus56> stop giving us good cards
[2023-01-07 19:52:42] <msoly55> yeah wheel seems it could give your opponent more broken things than you.
[2023-01-07 19:52:50] <msoly55> i would cut wheel and depths combo and just play fun
[2023-01-07 19:52:51] <%+bfg0> you could definitely cut a discard outlet
[2023-01-07 19:52:53] <Vulfe> I think cutting red is really low upside
[2023-01-07 19:53:01] <!%+spys212> Looting is too nuts in this deck to cut
[2023-01-07 19:53:12] <%+seeker509> So opus cast asmo. And grave tutors dare devil. We can be a reanimator deck with gear hulk and archon
[2023-01-07 19:53:16] <maletintohs> Im down to cut deepts combo instead of red
[2023-01-07 19:53:19] <Vulfe> yeah I really don't want to cut faithless looting

[2023-01-07 19:54:25] <+kentuckyfri3d> round 4 is starting!!
[2023-01-07 19:54:30] <chalobisbal> its not so good
[2023-01-07 19:54:34] <chalobisbal> its just outlets
[2023-01-07 19:54:42] <%+devoncoltrane> I think you should cut the wheel in either version
[2023-01-07 19:54:45] <birdsof> Copter?
[2023-01-07 19:54:47] <msoly55> I think cutting red semes fine, or cutting depths combo to keep harvester + looting
[2023-01-07 19:54:50] <MindGameArcade> looting hurts to lose but yeah
[2023-01-07 19:54:54] <%maxwread> copter
[2023-01-07 19:54:59] <ozkantheflip> looting is the biggest loss but its not that bad
[2023-01-07 19:55:00] <%haunter_hunter> what if you just cut all the red EXCEPT for looting and bloodtithe?
[2023-01-07 19:55:08] <%+trans1uc3nt> Copter, and mind shatter to bring red
[2023-01-07 19:55:13] <%haunter_hunter> and just play light splash
[2023-01-07 19:55:18] <%+thelittledonnie> Mono B is the ticket
[2023-01-07 19:55:18] <%maxwread> this deck is BG what are you talking about
[2023-01-07 19:55:22] VIEWERS: 1¬†183
[2023-01-07 19:55:23] <MindGameArcade> Sad mono black :(
[2023-01-07 19:55:24] <+Darkscythe22> The red splash does look great
[2023-01-07 19:55:33] <+kentuckyfri3d> round 4 mr spike
[2023-01-07 19:55:39] <+kentuckyfri3d> !!
[2023-01-07 19:55:46] <MindGameArcade> that mox diamond will never tap for red :(
[2023-01-07 19:56:02] <cw8smith> factory is also a creature when you need it
[2023-01-07 19:56:02] <+Darkscythe22> Looting over nights whisper
[2023-01-07 19:56:03] <+bduggs97> Just play flooting off single montain vista mox and lotus
[2023-01-07 19:56:12] <ozkantheflip> chup can always come in against creature heavy matchups
[2023-01-07 19:56:14] <+wendi_witcch> i feel like the small red splash is very worth it
[2023-01-07 19:56:16] <@%^MTGBot> Round 4 for the Modern Showcase Challenge event has started! aspiringspike is currently playing O_danielakos. Last seen deck 28 days ago: Murktide Regent (http://www.mtggoldfish.com/deck/5301336) (O_danielakos is also currently double queuing in a Standard Challenge.)
[2023-01-07 19:56:21] <%+devoncoltrane> brutality is uniquely strong in that it plays well against extreme control and extreme aggro.
[2023-01-07 19:56:39] <+puntcity> I kind of like that
[2023-01-07 19:56:41] <%+trans1uc3nt> copter, mind shatter, and petal
[2023-01-07 19:56:49] <%+Avinan> You have Blood Crypt too
[2023-01-07 19:56:58] <%+devoncoltrane> 6
[2023-01-07 19:57:06] <%+devoncoltrane> oh derp
[2023-01-07 19:57:06] <!%+spys212> Could still play factory over a swamp I tjink
[2023-01-07 19:57:08] <%maxwread> looks perfect
[2023-01-07 19:57:09] <%+devoncoltrane> depths
[2023-01-07 19:57:17] <%alittlecheeky> Lol it‚Äôs a slippery slope
[2023-01-07 19:57:19] <chalobisbal> that seems good
[2023-01-07 19:57:19] <yogaliberal> i like mono B, the consistency is such huge upside
[2023-01-07 19:57:23] VIEWERS: 1¬†183
[2023-01-07 19:57:27] <+puntcity> one of those lands is dark depths too
[2023-01-07 19:57:32] <+puntcity> which doesnt count
[2023-01-07 19:57:39] <%WorstPlayerHere> good afternoon @aspiringspike
[2023-01-07 19:57:41] <%+lytking> @puntcity tru
[2023-01-07 19:57:42] <%+trans1uc3nt> vintage cube is played with your heart not your head. B?R!

[2023-01-07 19:58:00] <cw8smith> factory
[2023-01-07 19:58:00] <%+devoncoltrane> add factory
[2023-01-07 19:58:02] <%maxwread> how often do we ever get to play looting tho
[2023-01-07 19:58:03] <msoly55> play the scrubland to bluf white?
[2023-01-07 19:58:07] <%+mmorality> forgot to readd factory
[2023-01-07 19:58:09] <Shadowless10> forgot factory, yeah
[2023-01-07 19:58:10] <%+bjkbsmith> add factory
[2023-01-07 19:58:11] <%+Avinan> We need like 2 more black fetches for the red splash imo
[2023-01-07 19:58:14] <%+scurtis9> friend played a game yesterday where t1 goblin guide revealed 4 lands for op and he drew 4 straight lands. talk about bad luck
[2023-01-07 19:58:19] <ozkantheflip> Reanimator is the one place I think Brutality is above mid
[2023-01-07 19:58:21] <MindGameArcade> hand hider please lol
[2023-01-07 19:58:29] <+SpecialEffectZz> @msoly55 not worth and opens you up to wasteland
[2023-01-07 19:58:33] <+yatalocked> good afternoon Spike, how'a the challenge? I see the 2-1, but how's the deck today?
[2023-01-07 19:58:55] <%$Ocara115> hate to see 2 removal spells
[2023-01-07 19:59:21] <%+trans1uc3nt> any consideration between iteration over consider veing taken

[2023-01-07 19:59:58] <ozkantheflip> rag was like the best draw against taking the consider
[2023-01-07 20:00:12] <%maxwread> its still a match
[2023-01-07 20:00:36] <%+trans1uc3nt> stupid monkey!

[2023-01-07 20:00:45] <%+Avinan> Our hand is so cheap. Just a land and we‚Äôre in this

[2023-01-07 20:01:26] <%jace_meister> Good afternoon chat and spike! speaking of ragavan, i was playing sultai food with pithing needle in their main deck, and my opponent stole it off ragavan when i had 2 cookbooks in play
[2023-01-07 20:01:28] <scoutertf2> opp bolts us and we in this Kappa
[2023-01-07 20:01:39] <%+matteosartorii> Your deck tried to give a land lol
[2023-01-07 20:01:54] <%$Ocara115> No bolt Prayge
[2023-01-07 20:02:16] <dvneal1> !card Lumengrid Sentinel
[2023-01-07 20:02:17] <@%^MTGBot> Lumengrid Sentinel, {2U} | Creature ‚Äî Human Wizard 1/2 | Flying / Whenever an artifact enters the battlefield under your control, you may tap target permanent.
[2023-01-07 20:02:25] <%+matteosartorii> second murk also gets us
[2023-01-07 20:02:29] <dvneal1> Pretty good at tapping down ragavans in blue-based food @jace_meister
[2023-01-07 20:02:42] <dvneal1> or lands I guess?

[2023-01-07 20:03:47] <%+matteosartorii> ts out against the removal/counter spell/pierce deck?
[2023-01-07 20:03:52] <LammBear> Surgery is kinda sick
[2023-01-07 20:03:54] <WaallyOne> this is one weird cube deck
[2023-01-07 20:03:59] <projectdre> Trim a breach?
[2023-01-07 20:04:13] <smirabito> Drown is pretty unreliable in this matchup in my experience
[2023-01-07 20:04:23] <%+matteosartorii> 2 for one in our favor with death shadow
[2023-01-07 20:04:33] <leoj2099> maybe you can cut one breach because of hearse
[2023-01-07 20:04:35] <%$Ocara115> They almost always have at least 2 cards in yard for drown
[2023-01-07 20:04:43] <%+trans1uc3nt> run only 2 pierce?
[2023-01-07 20:05:21] <+zabet54> thought monitor?

[2023-01-07 20:05:36] <%+Avinan> Guys Spike has played a LOT of Shadow and Murktide it‚Äôs okay lol
[2023-01-07 20:05:46] <+Gojo995> shredder over pierce

[2023-01-07 20:08:39] <%+matteosartorii> It's what I told my wife: Magic is a game that you draw lands when you don't want to and never draw them when you need them.
[2023-01-07 20:08:40] <%$Ocara115> Actual bullshit
[2023-01-07 20:08:52] <gtoast146> man...

[2023-01-07 20:09:02] <%+trans1uc3nt> I'd like to see the second half of the deck
[2023-01-07 20:09:04] <bbolter225> have you considered taking art classes
