[2022-12-09 14:56:39] <pluxd> isnt that just some people cant deal with the fact they lose 20% of their viewers in jail

[2022-12-09 15:19:05] <KND101> @travpiper biggest issue with d2 is if you want the full experiance have to spend $100+
[2022-12-09 15:19:07] <%totesjelly> They basically reworked EVERY subclass
[2022-12-09 15:19:15] <KND101> as a new player

[2022-12-09 17:58:53] <%xChevinxForever> @six_o_nine  just immigration to be honest, but they don't integrate into society properly

[2022-12-09 17:59:08] <bazzela> @six_o_nine I mean he has FIVE ballon d’ors at home so it’s understandable you know..
[2022-12-09 17:59:25] <%six_o_nine> He had the worst fucking face when he had to get in once the match was over, and left as soon as it ended, didnt go to his teammates,  that's all fucked up LUL
