[2023-01-06 00:01:12] <$MagnesiumOxide> if you log off first you'll have someone to blame it on!
[2023-01-06 00:01:17] <NinjaMaster__> can you double up on stainless?
[2023-01-06 00:01:33] <%TheWonderLlama> p2w PogChamp

[2023-01-06 00:01:52] <+Tempurs> probably been asked before but do you think you would want to take on GTNH after finishing nomi?
[2023-01-06 00:01:52] <KritterIsBack> can you generate nomicoins?

[2023-01-06 16:37:26] <AleXanDreMau> @ninopanda waffle has 2 options for the spawn colum! Move the spawn colum or change the spawn protection to 0. so they hare able to mine it!

[2023-01-06 16:44:35] <%silv> have an "infinite" world, decide to build towards the only 3x3 you can't destroy or build in
[2023-01-06 16:44:36] <%aundros> lots of good suggestions
[2023-01-06 16:44:56] <@%+PiratePati> @silv As if we knew Sadge
[2023-01-06 16:45:11] <@%+PiratePati> The factory must grow in all directions
[2023-01-06 16:45:18] <%aundros> Can always build around the column pati and decorate it that way Kappa
[2023-01-06 16:45:37] <@%+PiratePati> wont even let me place blocks around that 3x3 pillar
[2023-01-06 16:45:52] <%aundros> really? how far does the protection expand?
[2023-01-06 16:45:56] <@%+PiratePati> I was going to put item frames with our progression on them
[2023-01-06 16:46:14] <@%+PiratePati> a one block radius around the pillar
[2023-01-06 16:46:20] <@%+PiratePati> thats why the floor doesnt even touch it
[2023-01-06 16:47:02] <%aundros> so the 3x3 is really a 5x5

[2023-01-06 19:04:51] <%+lvyEartman> shouldnt power be stand alone?
[2023-01-06 19:04:53] <+CoolAcid> I might also suggest a crate of raw materials not connected as a backup to restart the system?
[2023-01-06 19:05:01] <%+TPells67> You need to make enderpearls to make diamonds, polymer clay, and resonant ender
[2023-01-06 19:05:25] <%GuardMoony> and diamond overflow towards main storage?

[2023-01-06 19:16:30] <+stormblaz> do u need to automate it?
[2023-01-06 19:16:32] <+Sam_1443> can you just store some resources in a chest to bootstrap it when you need to get it running again?

[2023-01-06 19:16:50] <PureSpider> hah clay!
[2023-01-06 19:16:51] <+stormblaz> off the grid thats crazy
[2023-01-06 19:16:51] <fapohogu> no need to automate it now just do it yourself for now dude
[2023-01-06 19:16:56] <her0zer0> might want to just scrap the old system first
[2023-01-06 19:16:57] <%WERT_ASDF> why would it make clay? isnt the clay system off the grid?
[2023-01-06 19:17:02] <meller127> How will you handle the lag that will come from drawers controller connected to the ME system? Warning in the quest book about this
[2023-01-06 19:17:13] <+stormblaz> makes sense why you want to make it separate
[2023-01-06 19:17:16] <sneakyHoovy> COPIUM
[2023-01-06 19:17:28] <Yakobro> @meller127 the warning is for large drawers, not the controllers really
[2023-01-06 19:17:31] <+thevemo> use a lvl emiter so it turns off if you have less then some amount of clay?
[2023-01-06 19:17:35] <+IlsaGold> Are we still within 12 drawers away?
[2023-01-06 19:17:39] <Yakobro> so if youy connect like 500 drawers to a controller

[2023-01-06 20:58:05] <+woodlaphroaig> I still don't know why they keep voting if they have not gotten guarentees that the 20 will change their vote

[2023-01-06 20:58:12] <+dahntat> But it is good and it is what we need to do... that is why our govt was set up this way....
[2023-01-06 20:58:17] <%+b0ltz12> that being said, if the opposition votes in favour for whatever reason, then it can succeed with the majority party being more split
[2023-01-06 20:58:18] <%lazyhot> In belgium we are used to that, we voted and then political majority forming a gouverment took 1.5j before we had a new gouvernement.

[2023-01-06 20:58:48] <MrSlagle> No one is sworn in until the speaker is elected. So the old representatives that were voted out have to sit in their seats and vote for a speaker before they can leave and go home.

[2023-01-06 21:18:08] <Yakobro> @Giantwaffle coils definitely increase multismelter, better coils process more items

[2023-01-06 21:25:23] <pinhead_larynx> filter is probably better than trying to mess with all the colors
[2023-01-06 21:25:23] <%+Traverus98> make a buffer chest then export from that with a color
[2023-01-06 21:25:24] <deadgolfer> just use another output, and filter on the ouput side
[2023-01-06 21:25:25] <+WARHERO322> Or extract from the controller on a diff color
[2023-01-06 21:25:25] <+OhTick> pull out of other side of controller?
[2023-01-06 21:25:26] <+Viviids> yea input top and output wherever
[2023-01-06 21:25:27] <Kcd23> should automate the fabricators and chambers because you will need to add to the system throughout playing
[2023-01-06 21:25:27] <bluedeed> Different side
[2023-01-06 21:25:27] <Yakobro> they can only take clay in the top, and only clay, you shouldn't need a filter?
[2023-01-06 21:25:29] <Flobu_> you could go from the drawer directly
[2023-01-06 21:25:29] <bluedeed> Of controller
[2023-01-06 21:25:29] <dylan0806> Why not filter the extract
[2023-01-06 21:25:30] <her0zer0> can't you just extract on a different color on the bottom?
[2023-01-06 21:25:31] <+Sentinel1_9> @Giantwaffle just take out from another side of the drawer system with a color
[2023-01-06 21:25:34] <+Soul12eaver> can you filter clay into a drawer and then have it go out to the system from that drawer?
[2023-01-06 21:25:36] <officialhunterx> loot fabs dont need pulsating
[2023-01-06 21:25:37] <+Koeckie> can't you output one more time with an other color? @Giantwaffle
[2023-01-06 21:25:37] <The_Holas> clay is not for fabricators ... Waffle
[2023-01-06 21:25:37] <InternetPlumber> you could use a buffer chest to split the top input conduit
[2023-01-06 21:25:37] <+DynamixBoon> You could extract from the drawer on an new channel
[2023-01-06 21:25:37] <+KingPuller> Just do another extraction on drawer that only pull polymer clay
[2023-01-06 21:25:38] <officialhunterx> only simulation chamber
[2023-01-06 21:25:39] <deadgolfer> instead of filter the input side, filter the output side
[2023-01-06 21:25:45] <%GuardMoony> set prio
[2023-01-06 21:25:47] <+DynamixBoon> fair enough :)
[2023-01-06 21:25:47] <The_Holas> clay is not for fabricators ... @Giantwaffle
[2023-01-06 21:25:53] <%+DragonApoc> You could ME the clay into the fabricators
[2023-01-06 21:26:32] <officialhunterx> its only sim chambers need pulsating
[2023-01-06 21:26:32] <+Koeckie> do one more output, use a different color for the clay and filter the output of the controller @Giantwaffle
[2023-01-06 21:26:34] <%lazyhot> simulation chambers only accept pulsating clay from top, so you don't need to filter that input.
[2023-01-06 21:26:36] <tomey36> Isn’t the priority backwards?
[2023-01-06 21:26:37] <JonnyL> monkaHmm

[2023-01-06 21:43:55] <lukasalbert> all it can accept is polymer clay ?
[2023-01-06 21:43:55] <Flobu_> you dont need to filter if you get it directly from the drawer

[2023-01-06 22:31:31] <Discoverer123> I started with Stoneblock and I think its a pretty good intro to mods
[2023-01-06 22:31:32] <Glitcher007> Above and Beyond is a little grindy though
[2023-01-06 22:31:33] <+SpellitOutLoud> Yes, it has quests
[2023-01-06 22:31:34] <%TheZmrdus6> i liked rustic waters 2
[2023-01-06 22:31:36] <Brandar711> @Flobu_ I didnt like it just because of the magic mods....not a fan of them
[2023-01-06 22:31:38] <%Zapper_777> Yo dont hae to do the Magic in FTB to enjoy it
