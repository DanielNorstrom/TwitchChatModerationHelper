[2022-12-26 18:38:51] <Crippa> i mean soak how many your comf with but
[2022-12-26 18:38:54] <justttwo> I think easiest way is tank soak all and get dispoelled
[2022-12-26 18:38:56] <FrostHitsThose> normal tanks prolly 2. You. 4
[2022-12-26 18:38:56] <%+Sparowfski> you take 200% increased damage per stack i believe
[2022-12-26 18:38:57] <draconisraccoonis> i soak 3-4 and have the healer dispell me
[2022-12-26 18:38:58] <Gildarts90> @Naowh higher keys u usually soak most
[2022-12-26 18:38:59] <%Patrikhg> 1 each is like the worst since u want to dispell tank if he gets many
[2022-12-26 18:39:11] <+TheRealSam3> Just just soak 2, get dispelled and soak the rest
