[2022-12-20 00:04:58] <Jackyd95> nah ranger iis the best
[2022-12-20 00:05:03] <+devil13467> what keybind is quick move?
[2022-12-20 00:05:20] <%ColeChiIls> I like rogue alot
[2022-12-20 00:05:33] <%ColeChiIls> Didnt they nerf spear ranger?
[2022-12-20 00:05:52] <FlowerWater_> feel like I see the least Barbs and Wizards

[2022-12-20 00:06:40] <+savealot2> high rollers takes the kill feed off
[2022-12-20 00:07:19] <%ins_space> yeah, and it feels so much better being off.
[2022-12-20 00:07:36] <+eggsmasher> how can it feel better xD
[2022-12-20 00:07:39] <FlowerWater_> nice
[2022-12-20 00:07:47] <ugongetthiswork> yeah kill feed is my only problem with the game rn
[2022-12-20 00:07:52] <%dangarlive> They should add a Davinci crossbow as a unique or something
[2022-12-20 00:07:57] <%ins_space> because there's more tension not knowing
[2022-12-20 00:08:06] <+eggsmasher> just dont look at the feed
[2022-12-20 00:08:13] <%ins_space> if somebody died, or if that dude I stabbed bled out or is still around
[2022-12-20 00:08:14] <FlowerWater_> @ugongetthiswork I don't like names for the squad either but it'd not really a big deal
[2022-12-20 00:08:19] <%ColeChiIls> @eggsmasher not that simple, surely you know that
[2022-12-20 00:08:30] <%ins_space> right, but its in my peripheral. Sometimes I just notice it

[2022-12-20 00:09:40] <FlowerWater_> @ugongetthiswork I think it would help solos too. Teams would get confused and lose their teammates like in Tarky
[2022-12-20 00:09:49] <kaneDamascus> one of them gets to go down at least

[2022-12-20 00:15:20] <CatEatingMushrooms> @Hambone187 It's tough, but not impossible. You have to be very picky about what fights you're taking, though.
[2022-12-20 00:16:20] <JobbyAuditor> that trading is so cool

[2022-12-20 00:17:30] <antdeebish> its so addicting for some reason
[2022-12-20 00:17:32] <FlowerWater_> yeah its like a real market
[2022-12-20 00:17:36] <speaking_Light> I'm level 3
[2022-12-20 00:18:26] <antdeebish> alot of people use the armor chat for actual armor which is nice
[2022-12-20 00:18:29] <FlowerWater_> even at 20 it's not that much easier. It's all about gear

[2022-12-20 00:20:36] <p4nnus> @FlowerWater_ gold is easier to get than certain items, so its not really worth it, is it?

[2022-12-20 00:20:54] <Thatoneguy31> what quality gear is he wearing for armor pieces?
[2022-12-20 00:20:58] <FlowerWater_> if you do it with starter items you can buy whatever you want in markety
[2022-12-20 00:21:06] <+SwankyCam> *Klean

[2022-12-20 00:21:16] <%+Lack240sx> @Lapsa  it's clearly a combination of KLean and cONAN
[2022-12-20 00:21:38] <antdeebish> ofc tht happens on sucha big trade wtf

[2022-12-20 02:28:16] <+vulkan_xviii> this game needs an insurance system like tarkov, "I died drop everything you grabbed the whole raid and grab my shit" is lame af but I get it
[2022-12-20 02:28:19] <Richie364> yeah the blocks were clutch
[2022-12-20 02:28:24] <Richie364> a lot would just panic swing
[2022-12-20 02:28:53] <+vulkan_xviii> hopefully thats something theyre working on

[2022-12-20 02:39:24] <Richie364> this is normal

[2022-12-20 02:39:50] <Richie364> @CyberDwitzz iirc it is not actually F2P, so on release im expecting player count to drop
[2022-12-20 02:40:17] <CyberDwitzz> game has lots of potential
[2022-12-20 02:40:40] <%ins_space> doubt it will drop to numbers below alpha testing numbers

[2022-12-20 03:02:26] <Richie364> @arcthe0ry not yet, the games balanced around trio so i guess they will implement an option to queue into a team

[2022-12-20 21:22:40] <+ironsavant> you should playtest dark and darker when it comes back up in 30min from a patch
[2022-12-20 21:22:46] <+RaisinEyebrows> If Bard can use Mage Hand, i'll be a very happy feller.
[2022-12-20 21:22:53] <%alexschul> lmao imagine hearing a bard sing a song about your death from across the dungeon
[2022-12-20 21:23:13] <+ironsavant> fighting kinda like combat in mount and blade lol
[2022-12-20 21:23:15] <@%+Sev07Sniper> @pepperepper Rimworld is basedon  this but this is much more rugged, by both design and necessity
[2022-12-20 21:23:21] <%+Laughing_Man_d8D> okay, I might pull the trigger for Dark and Darker for the bard

[2022-12-20 21:24:10] <@%+Sev07Sniper> I'd personally say Rimworld is better just because there are a bazillion mods to make it however you want.  But if you want a very deep vanilla experience this is great fromo what I can see

[2022-12-20 21:43:32] <owen550> what's adventure mode?

[2022-12-20 21:43:36] <MsYakumo> The way the fortress and adventure mode interplay is pretty nifty as well.
[2022-12-20 21:43:41] <%+Kalbadour> like: ☺
[2022-12-20 21:43:44] <RatRays> just make sure you keep all your old big saves for adventure mode

[2022-12-20 21:44:06] <+ecody> like kenshi?
[2022-12-20 21:44:11] <RatRays> its like a roguelike
[2022-12-20 21:44:12] <AllHighAustin> You can also visit your own fort
[2022-12-20 21:44:16] <MsYakumo> Fortress mode is more like an RTS, where as adventure mode is more like a roguelike
[2022-12-20 21:44:41] <MsYakumo> And things you did in fortress mode carry over into adventure mode if you use the same world.

[2022-12-20 21:44:52] <MsYakumo> So you can 100% visit your own fort as an adventurer.

[2022-12-20 22:20:20] <+Fonze_a1> i think it wore off
[2022-12-20 22:20:21] <+Hurpud> maybe a max
[2022-12-20 22:20:25] <angry_roleplayer> also groups should have PVP penalty scaling
[2022-12-20 22:20:27] <Keyhall> fire burns not on the hit
[2022-12-20 22:20:29] <+pepperepper> @Klean the fire buff doesn't work on the dummies
[2022-12-20 22:20:30] <+Pibbs__> yeah i think if they lowered their headshot multiplier and got rid of quickshot they would be in a better place
[2022-12-20 22:20:50] <+Pibbs__> quick shot resets your quiver so you essentially have 10-12 arrows

[2022-12-20 22:20:58] <+bignoob111> the damage number from the ignite buff shows up at the base of the dummy
[2022-12-20 22:21:14] <+pepperepper> i don't see burn damage ticking when i tested it
[2022-12-20 22:21:19] <GrandpaClamps> @Pibbs__ solo has been fine, just adapt your playstyle. Every class is viable. Nothing is dumb, everything is being developed.
[2022-12-20 22:22:15] <+Pibbs__> solo is easy im saying separate queues for solo is dumb
[2022-12-20 22:22:36] <+Pibbs__> no need to split playerbase

[2022-12-20 22:23:25] <angry_roleplayer> solo is NOT fine lol, because you will never win 1vs2
[2022-12-20 22:23:33] <LukeeeeyyyD> you can win 1v2 but 1v3 is impossible
[2022-12-20 22:23:41] <+Overcast22> Never solo queue, solo would be all annoying builds

[2022-12-20 22:24:00] <+Pibbs__> having different dungeons high rollers etc i think will fix the game for solo players. More geared 3 stacks are just going to be in high roller in the long run

[2022-12-20 22:24:21] <Edngravy> this game is already infested with ESP cheaters 💀
[2022-12-20 22:24:29] <jonah0_0> why not just put the solo players into a 3 stack...like all other brs?
[2022-12-20 22:24:42] <%K1NG0F7R01LS> @LukeeeeyyyD I watched a wizard firsthand wipe a three stack. Wizards are terrifying.
[2022-12-20 22:24:44] <+Thaulus> I just want longer duration of self buffs on cleric. Im fine with picking my fights when solo but 20 sec duration is nothing in slow game like this
[2022-12-20 22:24:45] <+Hurpud> @Edngravy what do u mean
[2022-12-20 22:24:51] <+Overcast22> The game is balance around trios. Same reason Apex legends sucks solo

[2022-12-20 22:25:14] <lurmurt> @jonah0_0 Yeah this, but give a choice. They should definitely still give players the solo option.

[2022-12-20 22:25:59] <Razzmattazz__> @jonah0_0 because theres friendly fire and people you grief you and take your loot if youre with randoms
[2022-12-20 22:26:03] <+Hurpud> ye valid complaints from sacriel, considering a ranger can deal with all of that and not have to meditate
[2022-12-20 22:26:15] <kriippe> is this escape from tarkov but like Dungeons & Dragons?
[2022-12-20 22:26:18] <+IamLegend_x> mages still slap
[2022-12-20 22:26:21] <GOSUBO_> @jonah0_0 good idea pending on execution. tarkov for example..quieue with randoms they just kill u at spawn
[2022-12-20 22:26:25] <kriippe> monsters and stuff
[2022-12-20 22:26:30] <+Pibbs__> the beauty pf this game is its pretty easy to get gear, make gold and start to snowball in power

[2022-12-20 23:44:26] <Cheshired> Movement is way faster without weapon in hand but it's a gamble if enemy notices and turns on you.

[2022-12-20 23:44:50] <+OptionalGames> they stream tarkov just fine
[2022-12-20 23:44:55] <+OptionalGames> and dayz
[2022-12-20 23:44:56] <CatEatingMushrooms> @Klean Have you played around with the Pavise shield yet? It's really cool how you can deploy it as mobile cover.
[2022-12-20 23:45:00] <+mjay624> @cs_hague why not lmao tarkov has voip
[2022-12-20 23:45:00] <+grovak> @OPClarence yes, reds can still spawn as a 3 stack to go down but all blues are solo portals now ( triples still ahve to open all three its just 3 portals stacked on on spot)

[2022-12-20 23:46:09] <%+Tuocha> ive been lovin this game! Fighter class here too, i had no idea you could parry/riposte like that
[2022-12-20 23:46:12] <CS_Hague> Rounds in this game are shorter and combat is melee. You're far more likely to have some dude screaming racist shit in combat like your typical BR
[2022-12-20 23:46:29] <SuperFriendBFG> Yeah the devs have been steadily improving things over the past few playtests
[2022-12-20 23:46:45] <+mjay624> @cs_hague I don't see the connection between more bs in voip on this than tarkov
[2022-12-20 23:47:10] <+mjay624> @cs_hague melee games tend to attract an older audience too than shooters do

[2022-12-20 23:47:43] <Waaam> need a green fire now unfortunately
[2022-12-20 23:48:52] <+mrp1nk_live> Klean is a maestro with the longsword.
[2022-12-20 23:49:11] <CS_Hague> @mjay624 You don't wanna talk to give away your position in Tarkov and encounters happen at longer ranges. The time it takes to get in-raid is much longer too for Tarkov. The dynamic is much different. Get a melee kill in PUBG and see what you hear
[2022-12-20 23:49:17] VIEWERS: 873
[2022-12-20 23:49:34] <CS_Hague> Also, if you die in Tarkov you're dead and TTK is much shorter
[2022-12-20 23:49:35] <+itsarbitrage1337> @CS_Hague almost like disabling voip or voice chat would fix that eh?
[2022-12-20 23:49:43] <CS_Hague> Sure would
[2022-12-20 23:49:59] <%ColeChiIls> @CS_Hague If you dont like voip turn it off. its coming and all games should have the optiuon
[2022-12-20 23:50:10] <+mrp_32> Hey, how do you swing your sward different directions?
[2022-12-20 23:50:16] <+mrp_32> you can control it right?
[2022-12-20 23:50:25] <+grovak> have you tried the pavise yet?
[2022-12-20 23:50:29] <SuperFriendBFG> MC Hammer Pants + Longsword meta
[2022-12-20 23:50:43] <+grovak> you can drop it in a doorway to block mobs and just cheese them to death
[2022-12-20 23:51:07] <CatEatingMushrooms> @mrp_32 You don't control attack direction, each weapon has it's own attack combos.
[2022-12-20 23:51:17] VIEWERS: 873
[2022-12-20 23:51:52] <+grovak> you techinically still have some control over where it will swing once ou understand the moveset and combat trajectories
[2022-12-20 23:52:08] <+grovak> by mocing and spinning mid animation
[2022-12-20 23:52:10] <+grovak> moving*
