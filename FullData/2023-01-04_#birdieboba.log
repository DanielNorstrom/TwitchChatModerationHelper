[2023-01-04 06:05:16] <@%kdlutz> i mean you can either start going back by going to bed earlier or do a full rotation until its normal by staying up later
[2023-01-04 06:05:21] <%Stylomax> Fix your sleep schedule? And ruin the random factor of when you stream? Nawwww you'll ruin my side betting business
