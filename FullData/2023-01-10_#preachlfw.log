[2023-01-10 10:02:26] <TheBaconSenpai> @LasyPanda nice bait Kappa
[2023-01-10 10:02:27] <zreiii> he's going to steal our coffee biscuts Madge
[2023-01-10 10:02:28] <%fripple4> did he not state his goal in the trailer
[2023-01-10 10:02:29] <%ravenribb> COPIUM
[2023-01-10 10:02:29] <%+DMG9> and her ascian girlfriend
[2023-01-10 10:02:30] <%trebolf> How do you think they're gonna incorporate the "he was our brother" surprise into ff14??
[2023-01-10 10:02:31] <kainekaiser> Does he even know about the 1st KEKL
[2023-01-10 10:02:32] <%rymed> I am SO excited to get back to the first
[2023-01-10 10:02:33] <%KelticNight> Dave
[2023-01-10 10:02:33] <radassroach> "World of Light" can still be either First or Source

[2023-01-10 10:02:38] <%+Kayser1> Imagine if he tries to rejoin the first and the 13th

[2023-01-10 10:02:45] <%+MrBorisPavlov> Would be so wrong if he was just evil for evils sake for a change?
[2023-01-10 10:02:45] <%cranefluff> the two lesbians and their adopted son
[2023-01-10 10:02:45] <%+Penitente12> unukalhai?
[2023-01-10 10:02:45] <%$TrowGundam> I wonder if this is gonna be big. Traditionally the X.3 patch is the "end" to an Expac story, but with how EW ended it wouldn't make sense
[2023-01-10 10:02:45] <%vegas_ffxiv> We can dye the chocobo heads now :P
[2023-01-10 10:02:47] <%+Vitriol17> and the barmaid too
[2023-01-10 10:02:47] <togar> would be funny if by killing all ascians we cause the rejoining KEKW Clap
[2023-01-10 10:02:47] <Riyshn> From the line in the trailer, it sounded like he wants to die. Rip a gate large enough he can go though, and actualy die without the 13th trapping him in limbo
[2023-01-10 10:02:48] <SanosukeArg> Unukuluhai
[2023-01-10 10:02:48] <%Txn_Nerothos> yeah but the kid is from optional content KEKW
[2023-01-10 10:02:48] <%Balaur1135> Taynor and Unukalhai
[2023-01-10 10:02:49] <Buskaget> I wonder how that'd work with all the Gaia stuff being optional this far in

[2023-01-10 10:03:15] <%Txn_Nerothos> for that they need to make SHB role quest mandatory though @Preachlfw
[2023-01-10 10:03:17] <hiteki> I wanna rejoin myself
[2023-01-10 10:03:17] <SanosukeArg> Unukuluhai and "first's waitress" will be what link all toghether I HOPE

[2023-01-10 10:03:19] <LasyPanda> @Preachlfw No way cause it wasnt mandatory quest line
[2023-01-10 10:03:21] <%The_ElMuchacho> My theory is that Golbez was the Original Warrior of Darkness that was told in the 1st, Ascians took him there long time ago and he learned about that place and now believes that the 1st is a world of light where they can die
[2023-01-10 10:03:22] <kainekaiser> @Preachlfw Are you gonna read the patch note?
[2023-01-10 10:03:23] <%+Everwaltz> Clueless

[2023-01-10 10:03:31] <timothyung> he just wants to be free Sadge
[2023-01-10 10:03:32] <%$TheyCantArrestUsAll> Stepbro he's stuck
[2023-01-10 10:03:32] <Furtbute> Everyone on that reflection dies during a rejoining right?
[2023-01-10 10:03:33] <+rudezki> I think their efforts will be minimal in the grand scheme, since not everyone played all the role quests
[2023-01-10 10:03:33] <lordGualz> Golbez just want to eat all the aether in the first
[2023-01-10 10:03:34] <%trebolf> How do you think they're gonna incorporate the "he was our brother" surprise into ff14??
[2023-01-10 10:03:36] <%$TrowGundam> It could still happen. YOu just don't have the Ascians trying to make it happen, so its still a threat technically
[2023-01-10 10:03:37] <%$TheFuriyon> I think outside of Pandæmonium, the ancient/ascian stories are largely over, maybe we'll deal with remnants now
[2023-01-10 10:03:40] <$toaladelta> he seems to want to bring death back to the 13th
[2023-01-10 10:03:41] <+Kinkarcana> RED HERRING

[2023-01-10 10:03:56] <%spejspag> It's Zero
[2023-01-10 10:03:56] <edquinox> Golbez want to restore the 13th by taking light aspected aether from the 1st, that's my theory

[2023-01-10 10:04:26] <%rymed> @Zeroslayer LUL
[2023-01-10 10:04:28] <$toaladelta> he literally says it in the trailer @Preachlfw
[2023-01-10 10:04:29] <%cranefluff> he cant have full control if his adversaries cant die
[2023-01-10 10:04:29] <Furtbute> Maybe Zero is the WoL shard in the 13th?
[2023-01-10 10:04:31] <%+Mokawic> thats what he said in the trailer
[2023-01-10 10:04:32] <%Mordwyl> He might want access to the lifestream since nothing in the void can die
[2023-01-10 10:04:32] <%Vinestra28> Golbez seemingly wants to let all the 13th to stop being immortal
[2023-01-10 10:04:33] <%trebolf> Are we gonna have a "Golbez was our brother" reveal? How are they gonna do it in ff14??
[2023-01-10 10:04:34] <%+KyaranAmanore> Golbez's looking for a way out of the loop. At least
[2023-01-10 10:04:37] <Camer51> He said he wanted death in the trailer LUL

[2023-01-10 10:11:35] <MaximumDRG> as opposed to casting split runs in wow? how is it any worse than that

[2023-01-10 10:11:42] <%+TheSpiceRackGaming> You have cast through splits!
[2023-01-10 10:11:43] <+arobba> more watchable than splits KEKW

[2023-01-10 10:11:47] <Nightshade1008> Fair enough
[2023-01-10 10:11:51] <spudmorph> disagree, its very watchable the first day at least
[2023-01-10 10:11:53] <roadroller_dah> wow has 200 splits though
[2023-01-10 10:11:54] <%Mordwyl> Mike you casted boring ass WoW raids though

[2023-01-10 10:11:55] <%Zziggz> better than split runs lol
[2023-01-10 10:11:55] <StreamBonker> if its race and this wont be as hard as DSR, i feel it would be a lot faster

[2023-01-10 12:45:27] <%ilandra> @turtleandfish what if gods need dynamis? Therefore came into existence when the massive dynamis drain (aka blue bird) was dealt with?
[2023-01-10 12:45:30] <%KelticNight> no,m that was Preach barking.
[2023-01-10 12:45:45] <%turtleandfish> @boddhum well you clicked this stream and you gonna get spoiled by the alliance raid story
[2023-01-10 12:45:49] <$crimsondawn12345> Nah chat it was mike who was barking
[2023-01-10 12:45:59] <Furtbute> Maybe the gods are products of creation magic?
[2023-01-10 12:46:08] <boddhum> trial is msq tho
[2023-01-10 12:46:18] <%KelticNight> in the North of England it is common for people to "bark" while they pee
[2023-01-10 12:46:19] <%+BartyBreakerDragon> I reckon we should summon Susanno, and invite the Gods for a party
[2023-01-10 12:46:21] <%turtleandfish> @ilandra hmm thats also true, i mean if we get to use lb3 by having belief, then a lot of belief should result in a god
[2023-01-10 12:46:31] <WhiteLazuli> did the 12 symbols exist in elpis or am i misremembering?
[2023-01-10 12:46:35] <$crimsondawn12345> @kelticnight very true
[2023-01-10 12:46:36] <$toaladelta> My guess is theyre related to the people who designed and created Zodiark
[2023-01-10 12:46:37] <+kiahoga> theyre not primals but can affected by faith also Emet know who they are before they came to be seen as tge twelve
[2023-01-10 12:47:01] <+wolf_horn> most primal need a base to make themselves from like Shinryu was Bahamut now what of the original primals
[2023-01-10 12:47:09] <%+BartyBreakerDragon> My money is on them being the people who worked with Venat to make Hydalaen
[2023-01-10 12:47:14] <+catbotpizza> @WhiteLazuli people claim it do because they show up in the ktsis ast weapon, but i'd just dismiss that since cards is all this theory has

[2023-01-10 12:47:56] <$toaladelta> theres also a place in Elpis called "the twelve wonders"
[2023-01-10 12:47:58] <Furtbute> @BartyBreakerDragon I like that idea. Maybe Venat had entrusted some of her allies to watch over the newly sundered world.
[2023-01-10 12:48:02] <+wolf_horn> @bartybreakerdragon that does seem to be the most plausible theory
[2023-01-10 12:48:14] <%turtleandfish> can there be primals that were made out of dynamis rather than aether? kinda like the endsinger being made out of meteion's despair
[2023-01-10 12:48:58] <+catbotpizza> @BartyBreakerDragon pls no, everything in this game always boils down to "it was ascians/ancients" or "it was allagans" i hope gods are an original thing unrelated, otherwise they are just arcana constructs like the watcher on the moon
[2023-01-10 12:48:58] <+kiahoga> Another question is in the next wing whos the fourth boss?

[2023-01-10 12:50:05] <$toaladelta> @kiahoga Exactly, we originally thought that it would be 4 of the gods per raid, but now that we've defeated 5 in this raid, theres an open boss spot in part 3
[2023-01-10 12:50:16] <@%+ChunkeyNinja> My theory is that they are Venat's original followers and when she was made Hydaelyn she imbued them with power to help guide the first humans on the source

[2023-01-10 13:18:12] <%turtleandfish> the enthralling part was caused by the ascians

[2023-01-10 13:18:17] <WhiteLazuli> the primals were intentionally sabotage
[2023-01-10 13:18:19] <Flapscior> @Preachlfw Enthralling was a result of Ascians spreading around a screwed up summoning ritual.
[2023-01-10 13:18:19] <+Judders__> remember enthrallment was added by the Ascians
[2023-01-10 13:18:23] <$toaladelta> Primals dont always enthrall, that was part of the ascians design @Preachlfw

[2023-01-10 13:18:32] <errasos> @Preachlfw the problem is that there was a short story that said hydealyns summoning unraveled the souls of the followers.

[2023-01-10 14:43:12] <angrywowplayer1337> So I was on a public transit bus last night and my gut started to hurt. Belly rumbling like an earthquake kind of pain. I had to release the pressure and I let loose a silent and nasty fart. Stunk like rotten meat and sulfur. It was so foul that an older guy complained out loud and demanded whoever did it apologizes. I just am sat there laughing inside and let another one loose to reduce the pressure.

[2023-01-10 15:26:51] <%KelticNight> it was supposed to have an audience, in Florida, but chose not to go there cos Florida is a dumpster fire

[2023-01-10 15:27:32] <Killian_Hart> its fully online because of anti-lgbtq+ laws passed in florida. the venue is in florida and they couldn't cancel the contract in time and still recoup the cost, so for this year its online. also covid was a concern

[2023-01-10 15:48:11] <+Titan_Creed> I just discovered the Post-Moogle quests. Has Mike ever done those? At least one of his favorite side-characters is featured. (And it goes from horribly dark to full innuendo.)

[2023-01-10 15:50:18] <%+Skoragon> @lionlurks Some games have multiple categories. Any% is usually glitchy as heck, then you can get other categories where glitches are limited (non major glitches foor example)
[2023-01-10 15:50:32] <Sobyn> @lionlurks, Any% categories allow essentially anything. It's not cheating if everyone can do it
[2023-01-10 15:50:37] <%RamRots> PepeHands
[2023-01-10 15:50:37] <keylax> figuring out/executing those tricks is usually harder than actually completing the game legitimately

[2023-01-10 15:51:03] <%+DerZanael> @lionlurks depends on the game, there are even glitchless categories for speedruns - old 8/16bits games could be abused by manipulating the memory and bypass the whole game to get to the credits from the first screen in some cases
[2023-01-10 15:51:13] <%lionlurks> Alright, yeah i suppose there´s any% categories and another for the Purists :) But thanks for explaining!!
[2023-01-10 15:51:16] <%+Skoragon> Yeah there are discords for pretty much every game/series
[2023-01-10 15:51:25] <+Voksenfisk> how long is the actual game?
[2023-01-10 15:51:55] <%+DerZanael> @Voksenfisk 5 or 6 hours maybe ?
[2023-01-10 15:51:58] <%+DerZanael> maybe more

[2023-01-10 15:52:36] <%+Skoragon> 2 is the best one
[2023-01-10 15:52:38] <Unitama> So glitchless speedrun would be maybe 3,5 hours?
