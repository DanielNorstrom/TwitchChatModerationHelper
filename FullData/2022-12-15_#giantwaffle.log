[2022-12-15 17:08:31] <gormurinn> rejular expression?
[2022-12-15 17:08:31] <%+K3ll06s> |Thats text, what do you want to do else? slice at commas and count positions?
[2022-12-15 17:08:33] <+DaHackel> you dont need regex but its not that hard
[2022-12-15 17:08:39] <Tugz1> substring at :
[2022-12-15 17:08:47] <tbriers> does python have substringAfter and subString before?
[2022-12-15 17:08:50] <%+Grumpage> yeah you could select what you want gone and CTRL+D
[2022-12-15 17:08:52] <Tugz1> double substring
[2022-12-15 17:09:02] <0x000000> regex is quite simple for those lines
[2022-12-15 17:09:14] <+DaHackel> you dont learn anything from doing it manually :D
[2022-12-15 17:09:21] <+bognog> shift-alt drag multi line
[2022-12-15 17:09:23] <rawbits> but what do you learn from hardcoding it?
[2022-12-15 17:09:26] <BambooShoots> Ask ChatGPT to generate the regex
[2022-12-15 17:09:35] <%+Grumpage> ctrl+d waffle
[2022-12-15 17:09:35] <%cmmeth> KEKW

[2022-12-15 17:09:42] <%CantTouchDisNow> click and drag down
[2022-12-15 17:09:42] <%samger0> just use the regexr website

[2022-12-15 17:09:52] <BBQgril> KEKW
[2022-12-15 17:09:55] <+yoVespart> Search the sentence, select all and replace it
[2022-12-15 17:09:59] <imNoxel> mark "closest beacon is at" and then press alt+d
[2022-12-15 17:10:00] <ba_nanananananana> There needs to be a combined REGEX
[2022-12-15 17:10:00] <%Smithii> @Giantwaffle If you drag your mouse while holding down mouse-wheel, you can select multiple lines
[2022-12-15 17:10:00] <0x000000> =(-?\d+) is all you need Kappa
[2022-12-15 17:10:02] <+yoVespart> with a space or smth
[2022-12-15 17:10:03] <+bognog> it's vs code dude, drag a box
[2022-12-15 17:10:05] <imNoxel> alt+d while marking
[2022-12-15 17:10:06] <+DaHackel> just ask chatgpt to do the regex for you
[2022-12-15 17:10:11] <SakaMiep> the openai chat bot spits out some good regex :D
[2022-12-15 17:10:13] <Decode_Josh> Ctrl R, to replace
[2022-12-15 17:10:20] <ba_nanananananana> there needs to be a combined regex+sql course, 4 hours and you're done LUL
[2022-12-15 17:10:24] <%+GummiKu> ctrl + d
[2022-12-15 17:10:29] <NapstahOG> atleast use find and replace
[2022-12-15 17:10:30] <%+Grumpage> ^^^
[2022-12-15 17:10:34] <imNoxel> alt+shift+arrow-down for multi-line cursor
[2022-12-15 17:10:38] <rawbits> so Waffle is too lazy to be lazy?
[2022-12-15 17:10:39] <BBQgril> regez is ez, when you know how to do it
[2022-12-15 17:10:40] <imNoxel> painful
[2022-12-15 17:10:51] <Tugz1> replace : [
[2022-12-15 17:10:54] <%CantTouchDisNow> usually its ctrl + h to search and replace
[2022-12-15 17:10:59] <meriborg> find and replace?
[2022-12-15 17:11:00] <%$Tabakhase> ctrl+R to replace
[2022-12-15 17:11:05] <%+GummiKu> mark something and press ctrl + d to mark the next of the same text
[2022-12-15 17:11:07] <GuardMoony> find and replace :/
[2022-12-15 17:11:13] <+bognog> repalce : with :[  lul
[2022-12-15 17:11:13] <GuardMoony> if you don't want to do regex
[2022-12-15 17:11:21] <AleXanDreMau> i think is only alt + click were you want to delete but you can select multi lines (simple click dont drag)
[2022-12-15 17:11:57] <itsIffy> there is
[2022-12-15 17:12:01] <+bognog> lol
[2022-12-15 17:12:02] <Janzert> probably yeah
[2022-12-15 17:12:12] <Janzert> should be using vim :P
[2022-12-15 17:12:20] <%+TheMooseII> oh there is an easy way...
[2022-12-15 17:12:34] <NapstahOG> double left bracket

[2022-12-15 17:14:24] <NapstahOG> why learn tho just use it KEKW
[2022-12-15 17:14:29] <rawbits> regex would be like 5 mins for you
[2022-12-15 17:14:34] <itsIffy> regexr YEP
[2022-12-15 17:14:35] <ba_nanananananana> yes but by learning REGEX you can forget everything about it in the future until you learn REGEX again and
[2022-12-15 17:14:36] <%$Tabakhase> literally is as simple as "Sensor ar x=(.*), y=(.*).." here LUL
[2022-12-15 17:14:38] <0x000000> we know
[2022-12-15 17:14:40] <%samger0> learning regex is borrowing time from future problems
[2022-12-15 17:14:40] <headbang3rboogie> There is an XKCD about regex
[2022-12-15 17:14:40] <@%TheGrumpieGnome> i know regex :)
[2022-12-15 17:14:41] <@COLDFiR3> or Replace \r\n with ]]\r\n no regex
[2022-12-15 17:14:43] <@%TheGrumpieGnome> i made it
[2022-12-15 17:14:43] <Myekos> been using regex for 22 years
[2022-12-15 17:14:43] <%+Grumpage> regex isn't scary, this would be a good learning example
[2022-12-15 17:14:45] <JayPeaSize> I know it enough for my own uses :P
[2022-12-15 17:14:46] <%Smithii> It is fucking useful LUL
[2022-12-15 17:14:48] <%DX_Plates> I just wrote RegEx to clean HTML Hyperlink out of a string.

[2022-12-15 17:14:55] <Magnus005> stack overflow for regex
[2022-12-15 17:15:02] <GuardMoony> which regex? there like 3 types or so :p
[2022-12-15 17:15:04] <ba_nanananananana> no really, learn REGEX, just not on stream during AOC
[2022-12-15 17:15:17] <satyasann> isn't that what most of us do. search or put something on a website KEKW
[2022-12-15 17:15:37] <%$Tabakhase> wouldnt even call this "regex" here with such a fixed format :P

[2022-12-15 17:23:29] <+DaHackel> instead of length check you should just initalize it with the value

[2022-12-15 17:27:21] <+kenshin2666> @deathfurr its mainly because python relies so heavily on its indentation

[2022-12-15 17:29:06] <+DaHackel> you could just run from the lowest to the highest number and check if its in any segement :D

[2022-12-15 17:30:24] <Boefst> just combine with the last value in the combined list if overlapping
[2022-12-15 17:30:35] <Janzert> the default sort will do that

[2022-12-15 17:32:29] <%deathfurr> @kenshin2666 LUL it's not so bad, a lot of websites still use php
[2022-12-15 17:32:35] <!%Joshuapetch> It's about what you know, not what you did
[2022-12-15 17:32:39] <TheIrishGuy> that's the boat story
[2022-12-15 17:32:41] <ColdFusion17> $1 to tighten the bolt, $149 to know where to tighten it
[2022-12-15 17:32:51] <%DX_Plates> Thats what code reviews are for
[2022-12-15 17:32:51] <+kenshin2666> paying for the expertise, not the job
[2022-12-15 17:32:53] <%+Grumpage> php has been called dead for over 20 years. Still most websites use it
[2022-12-15 17:32:56] <heymarkhansen> TIL sorted too
[2022-12-15 17:32:58] <Andersxa> i use github copilot. it usually knows some cool ways to do it
[2022-12-15 17:33:02] <BBQgril> YEP
[2022-12-15 17:33:08] <Stragmol> learning how sorted works helps understand the problem though
[2022-12-15 17:33:09] <Myekos> it's not the sweat or the frustration in doing the work, it's in the result
[2022-12-15 17:33:09] <samfisherpog> well I just chatgpt now
[2022-12-15 17:33:10] <ba_nanananananana> it's $149 when to use sorted() and when to write your own tho
[2022-12-15 17:33:11] <+jacques_412> how long have you been programming? you seem very good at it
[2022-12-15 17:33:20] <jiwandi> I use chatgpt POGGIES
[2022-12-15 17:33:23] <floro9> strange that people pay you to code for yourself .... hmmm strange
[2022-12-15 17:33:31] <Bernd135> Did you know that in Python a for loop has a else part that is called if the loop was not stopped with break
[2022-12-15 17:33:35] <%+xavier2119> Thats most of the reason I have a hard time learning programming
[2022-12-15 17:33:36] <BBQgril> just ask chatgpt 4Head
[2022-12-15 17:34:00] <%DX_Plates> @jacques_412 He has tinkered with AoC a couple times, and plays coding and engineering games. He has an engineer brain.
[2022-12-15 17:34:01] <Boefst> pretty sure python doesn't like that
[2022-12-15 17:34:12] <samfisherpog> I love when we go back being plumbers cuz chatgpt will take our jobs KEKW
[2022-12-15 17:34:27] <+DaHackel> you need the for loop over the index to asign
[2022-12-15 17:34:30] <GrammurPowlice> @jacques_412 this is just basics lol
[2022-12-15 17:34:31] <%+Grumpage> new list
[2022-12-15 17:34:39] <+nelzon1> for i in range(len(r):
[2022-12-15 17:34:43] <Myekos> hey chatgpt, which bolt do I turn?
[2022-12-15 17:34:48] <Boefst> index, item
[2022-12-15 17:34:56] <Janzert> I wasn't paying close enough attention, is he actually passing it the sorted segments?
[2022-12-15 17:34:57] <%DX_Plates> numanuma?
[2022-12-15 17:35:08] <samfisherpog> key,value

[2022-12-15 17:35:58] <%imTymp> yes but no but yes no
[2022-12-15 17:36:03] <Stragmol> is enumerate 0 based?
[2022-12-15 17:36:06] <GrammurPowlice> @lorddud it's addicting
[2022-12-15 17:36:13] <+DaHackel> you need to do line[i] not seg[i]
[2022-12-15 17:36:15] <Janzert> @Stragmol by default yes
[2022-12-15 17:36:32] <Boefst> you probably want a new list as you need to add a new segment if you can't combine
[2022-12-15 17:36:55] <%DX_Plates> +=?

[2022-12-15 17:37:20] <Janzert> modify a list as you iterate over it is likely not to do what you want
[2022-12-15 17:37:31] <%+OMICRON> waffleSPIN
[2022-12-15 17:37:42] <%Mobriin> Should you not run this on the sorted list?
[2022-12-15 17:37:48] <+DaHackel> youre not using the sorted list i think
[2022-12-15 17:37:54] <Janzert> pretty sure you're passing non-sorted segments into find_overlaps currently
[2022-12-15 17:38:07] <GuardMoony> infinite loop now ?
[2022-12-15 17:38:13] <ChecoElRey> 5Head
[2022-12-15 17:38:32] <Boefst> else append should append segment
[2022-12-15 17:39:06] <+DaHackel> last one should be fine probably
[2022-12-15 17:39:19] <+gilroyvfx> Waffle seen you play since I watched Lirik sever years ago, not aware if you learned programming on stream over the last few years, or if you are a programmer prior to streamer.
[2022-12-15 17:39:28] <Boefst> yeah last one should be enough with sorted list
[2022-12-15 17:39:40] <KevinExizt> hello
[2022-12-15 17:39:47] <+The_CK_> are you doing part 1 or 2?

[2022-12-15 17:40:05] <+gilroyvfx> awe cool
[2022-12-15 17:40:17] <+DaHackel> you need to get the last element out of the list
[2022-12-15 17:40:29] <Janzert> non_overlap_lines[-1][1]

[2022-12-15 17:41:39] <Boefst> yes
[2022-12-15 17:41:42] <Janzert> non_overlap_lines[-1] is the last segment in that list
[2022-12-15 17:41:44] <+DaHackel> negative index counts from the end
[2022-12-15 17:42:08] <Boefst> row 48 should be non_overlap_lines[-1]
[2022-12-15 17:42:35] <+DaHackel> every i should be -1
[2022-12-15 17:42:38] <recyclepoopandeatit3> wat a crappy code atleast used object destructoring and template literals to make it more readable
[2022-12-15 17:42:44] <+DaHackel> you dont need to eneumerate segment
[2022-12-15 17:42:54] <Janzert> i is indexing in the segment list
[2022-12-15 17:42:56] <ehsanpo> HeyGuys
[2022-12-15 17:43:22] <+DaHackel> youre comparing the second number not the first
[2022-12-15 17:43:32] <Boefst> you're checking Y not X non_overlap_lines[-1][0] should work

[2022-12-15 17:50:03] <+DaHackel> what if there are multiple segments?
[2022-12-15 17:50:11] <Janzert> you want the array in an array incase there are more than 1 non-overlapping segments at the end
[2022-12-15 17:50:19] <Schwee09> for example, y = 11 has multiple segments

[2022-12-15 17:51:18] <%bobolpwnz> You should not count 'B' and 'S'

[2022-12-15 17:51:38] <Janzert> you need the array in an array
[2022-12-15 17:51:41] <+DaHackel> you need to not return [0]

[2022-12-15 17:51:49] <DrNeurosis> and find_overlaps
[2022-12-15 17:51:54] <Boefst> you need to return all segments then loop through them when you add
[2022-12-15 17:52:07] <+DaHackel> you return only the fiirst segmenet
[2022-12-15 17:52:26] <Andersxa> you just added the [0] didnt u?

[2022-12-15 17:57:35] <Janzert> so you need to find the one square a beacon could be in not covered by the sensors
[2022-12-15 17:57:42] <whyando> wait but you did the hard part already by writing a non linear solution for part 1
[2022-12-15 17:57:50] <+DaHackel> just go through all lines and check if there is an empty spot in the range it wants
[2022-12-15 17:58:06] <Tensten> You have to find area where which is not covered by current sensors/beacons

[2022-12-15 18:11:10] <mikwitty> @Kollisco many ways to answer it, Waffle's way is inefficient but funny if it works
[2022-12-15 18:11:12] <ShinzoSin> @Giantwaffle can you link to the puzzle?
[2022-12-15 18:11:21] <+Hazno> @GummiKu oh, guess it's slow at rolling out then.. even if you manually press Check for updates?

[2022-12-15 18:11:24] <bogbogovajebemtiboga> just add this before the loop: with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=4) as executor:
[2022-12-15 18:11:26] <Janzert> you're condition to find the gap right now may hve false positives btw

[2022-12-15 18:12:07] <Janzert> there could be gaps outside of the 0 to 4mil range
[2022-12-15 18:12:13] <nothingbout> there won't be more than one gap.  if you get false positives, your code has a bug
[2022-12-15 18:12:17] <Kurbol> Have you learned "big O notation" (algorithm complexity)?
[2022-12-15 18:12:25] <+DaHackel> if its at a negative x its false positive

[2022-12-15 18:30:46] <$wtfblub> probably windows file cache theres no reason to free the memory when you at only 16% usage
[2022-12-15 18:30:50] <%GFQPR1882> Restart and lets see ?
[2022-12-15 18:30:55] <Janzert> it's probably the OS not python holding onto it
[2022-12-15 18:30:56] <%$Tabakhase> anyhow - you got the ram, so why the fuck you care YEP
[2022-12-15 18:30:57] <RationalLies> jshibaHmmm he opened that file 40M times, maybe we should keep a few copies in RAM

[2022-12-15 18:31:10] <Zuiuzz> the 12Gb is just how windows works I believe. if you throw more memory at it it will cache more files

[2022-12-15 18:31:13] <+DaHackel> it has nothing to do with python

[2022-12-15 19:07:26] <%+forthereals> you can zoom in and see a line to increase accuracy
[2022-12-15 19:08:27] <VaultPls> can you put multiple herbs into the pestle?
[2022-12-15 19:08:30] <Amenophiz> can you mash more than 1 herb at a time ?

[2022-12-15 19:09:48] <+Sentinel1_9> it would be a better recipe if you didnt use 2 raw of the same thing LUL
[2022-12-15 19:09:51] <+peterdraws> is there no logic to which direction things are?
[2022-12-15 19:10:08] <HeartisticPanda> use the swirl
[2022-12-15 19:10:13] <SimonSez> That should not be necessary @s_DeXTeR_s
[2022-12-15 19:10:24] <s_DeXTeR_s> @SimonSez tnx
[2022-12-15 19:10:25] <+xDeadBringerx> @peterdraws There is, the name of the ingredients give you some hints of the direction
[2022-12-15 19:10:25] <%Crazyfox55> You should get the books by going down a different path
[2022-12-15 19:10:28] <Kilowatt31> the swirls drain your water?
[2022-12-15 19:10:32] <SmartDoll> @peterdraws there is a logic, it's not completely random
[2022-12-15 19:10:33] <%TheMaestroT> The effects are located in a way that makes sense to me, anyway :)
[2022-12-15 19:10:41] <+FUITP> You can mash it quicker if you will drop masher from greater height
[2022-12-15 19:10:58] <+peterdraws> SmartDoll I mean if you're looking for a growth potion, how do you know where to look for it
[2022-12-15 19:11:05] <+FUITP> I mean if you still hold it

[2022-12-15 19:11:21] <SmartDoll> @peterdraws well logically I would look in a similar element direction as healing one

[2022-12-15 19:11:24] <%Sanduckchan> you can mash it faster if you twerk in front of it waffleSmart

[2022-12-15 20:25:41] <+Permarin1> @Giantwaffle im wondering.. if you make a max healing, and brew, then go back to healing with the same one, can you make a 5 healing?
[2022-12-15 20:25:53] <%Smithii> He'll pay extra for your hairy banana waffleLewd

[2022-12-15 20:26:05] <CultOfNeurisis> does it give more reputation though? might not be a money tradeoff
[2022-12-15 20:26:06] <PureSpider> @Permarin1 yes
[2022-12-15 20:26:09] <+MechaDom> They usually want over half of it with the requested ingredient
[2022-12-15 20:26:09] <%TheWonderLlama> no effort NOPERS
[2022-12-15 20:26:10] <lzrdou> @vanilla2011 Hows memory management compared to C?
[2022-12-15 20:26:10] <Onimage> he didn't mean the ingredient gachiBASS
[2022-12-15 20:26:14] <PureSpider> @Dagmoo stmBrows
[2022-12-15 20:26:41] <%Sanduckchan> Permarin1 think that would make the alchemist equipment pointless
[2022-12-15 20:26:43] <+Soul12eaver> you can just save a light3 potion and then continue the brew and chuck a hairy banana but not go anywhere with it i think for the special ingredient requests
[2022-12-15 20:26:44] <MrRey3> @Permarin1 no, doesn't work, once you brew, the "effect" disapear from the map
[2022-12-15 20:26:48] <%hockeygoaliechris> what does the machine need
[2022-12-15 20:26:59] <%Smithii> Make the enemy stronger :D
[2022-12-15 20:27:00] <+Permarin1> @Sanduckchan i see
[2022-12-15 20:27:09] <%+kenny_zk> WAIT what about a poison and stre.. oh okay
[2022-12-15 20:27:12] <%+kenny_zk> KEKW
[2022-12-15 20:27:17] <The_Scrapy> @lzrdou C is a great starting language because you learn how to do programming properly which trikles down into every other language
[2022-12-15 20:27:25] <%+vanilla2011> @vanilla2011 great! Modern C++ uses the STL library, which handles most of the memory management through smart pointers. It's good to learn the old ways of doing things in C, so you know what is happening under the hood. But there is light at the end of the tunnel, promise <3
[2022-12-15 20:27:33] <%+bcdmonkey> I think which was in red right?

[2022-12-15 20:29:10] <%$Mandorake> @Giantwaffle one of the crystals you can buy lets you do this easier by letting you jump over the bones
[2022-12-15 20:29:10] <+peterdraws> maybe the portals can make it cheaper to get there
[2022-12-15 20:29:15] <lzrdou> @vanilla2011 nice to hear that! CPP is next one to learn and I was wondering if it feels as "manual" as C

[2022-12-15 21:26:51] <Speedglass> lead ironically is necessary to harvest gold these days

[2022-12-15 21:26:55] <%Zapper_777> Iron grid...
[2022-12-15 21:26:58] <%+lvyEartman> most upper isotopes all come down to lead
[2022-12-15 21:26:58] <BrosBroFisting> that's why they make carbon fiber and not iron fiber
[2022-12-15 21:26:58] <+decipherment> iron
[2022-12-15 21:27:00] <+Eulersgold> it's great for making organic compounds for sure.
[2022-12-15 21:27:00] <+Babyblasphemy> stable is stable, never changes

[2022-12-15 21:27:26] <+xDeadBringerx> Iron and lead are extremely stable. A lot of fission/decay chains end up with lead @Giantwaffle
[2022-12-15 21:27:26] <$lazyeyesam> Lead maybe.
[2022-12-15 21:27:29] <Stragmol> iron skillets last forever

[2022-12-15 22:03:07] <&%+Tech> @Fufcia ours are pretty locked in. You basically need to get Business Leader level approval to get anything pushed through a blocked window, and they typically hate being on the hook for breakages
[2022-12-15 22:03:11] <PureSpider> @SirusGaming_ ixion
[2022-12-15 22:03:15] <+Frosset1X> no actually you sell for less
[2022-12-15 22:03:15] <wizizman> if the work together
[2022-12-15 22:03:20] <+Ghreengo> no, sometimes the will pay less if extra effects

[2022-12-15 22:03:26] <%GFQPR1882> That will slow them down KEKW @dx_plates
[2022-12-15 22:03:28] <+SirusGaming_> @PureSpider i saw that - so 100% worth it for that game yeah?

[2022-12-15 22:29:47] <MrRey3> @GFQPR1882 I try to refrain from using wikis, they sometimes spoil the fun on games like this one :)
[2022-12-15 22:29:47] <+Soul12eaver> yeah if you dont mix too hard you can just ride the swirl a little to the other side. its nice for subtle repositioning

[2022-12-15 23:09:48] <Myekos> one more
[2022-12-15 23:09:49] <+Obsidian_Vanir> This is similar, but distinct enough from Potionomics, the actual potion making is a bit more involved
[2022-12-15 23:09:54] <%$Mandorake> @Giantwaffle this game needs a stock market
[2022-12-15 23:09:54] <Redlessx> bro this is such a good game for waffle
[2022-12-15 23:09:54] <PureSpider> agree NODDERS
[2022-12-15 23:09:57] <DaemonSzyman> Or you could use your own potions
[2022-12-15 23:09:57] <MikeeSwe> @Canida1120 i can gladly take a code of your hands :D

[2022-12-15 23:10:15] <%Smithii> Can you use a wild growth potion on the garden? @Giantwaffle
[2022-12-15 23:10:15] <count3rnova> yea better to target farm certain ingredients
[2022-12-15 23:10:15] <Hotbox818> planting stuff would be sick
[2022-12-15 23:10:18] <&%+Tech> and it's harder to garden the non-starter ones
[2022-12-15 23:10:19] <PureSpider> @Canida1120 waffle read pls

[2022-12-15 23:11:54] <MiczuPL> What if plants have accelerated growth? First day +1, next +2, +3, +4 = wait vs instant plants
[2022-12-15 23:11:55] <+Mujona> New potion tree PauseChamp ?
[2022-12-15 23:11:56] <JonLimitless> I think FromSoftware would beg to differs on the punishment vs reward theory...

[2022-12-15 23:15:04] <houfnice> what does the oil do?
[2022-12-15 23:15:06] <DaemonSzyman> Maybe thats the point, cheaper to make but lower quality?
[2022-12-15 23:15:07] <PureSpider> waffle everything is MUCH closer
[2022-12-15 23:15:07] <+strickyR> distances are much shorter

[2022-12-15 23:15:29] <domatata> you need to tilt the potion
[2022-12-15 23:15:29] <@%TheGrumpieGnome> probably less potion types?
[2022-12-15 23:15:40] <+Mick_> rotating the potion is something you must research
