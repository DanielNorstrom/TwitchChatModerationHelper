[2023-01-10 00:00:06] <%big_kev_12> you drank piss water from that dodgy well
[2023-01-10 00:00:08] <krisggm> Had to take one more pill after you got cured probably, to,prevent getting sick again
[2023-01-10 00:00:13] <+toobublik> first person Taki? no wayu
[2023-01-10 00:00:14] <@%Dark_Wing_DuckZ> brb
[2023-01-10 00:00:15] <SamSlam67> It came back?!

[2023-01-10 00:00:35] <aj_slaughter> I'ts Tutanchamon's Bad Tummy's Plague
[2023-01-10 00:00:36] <%+galasteve> U have to Chuck away any meat u have already eaten or bottles u have drank from
[2023-01-10 00:00:37] <xmutsisbroidix> you dropped from the hunting stand that did it
[2023-01-10 00:00:41] <baufender> You have to pay for every map or only once for all?
[2023-01-10 00:00:41] <itsmereversecorey> What map is this
[2023-01-10 00:00:43] <%+soxes_> just the food you ate when you had samonill\a
[2023-01-10 00:00:44] <%Kranacus> Its just food you ate while sick
[2023-01-10 00:00:47] <CameIYogurt> i didnt know salmonella was transimssable lol or whatever
[2023-01-10 00:00:49] <+TheSpaceMunkey> its just because its pig
[2023-01-10 00:00:56] <%+ChrystalStar> He did a Bear Grylls and drank his piss in a snake skin
[2023-01-10 00:00:56] <Chardp> I think foos eaten while sick gets contaminated.  Happened to me.
[2023-01-10 00:00:56] <%john316hi> @TheRunningManZ you were cooking with bloody hands.. thought that was a nono
[2023-01-10 00:00:56] <+Rik_g> I got ill from meat someone else had cooked, could they of had bloody hands when they cooked it?
[2023-01-10 00:01:00] <%big_kev_12> @galasteve Ha ha
[2023-01-10 00:01:00] <%justth4tip> disinfect with alcohol @TheRunningManZ
[2023-01-10 00:01:02] <+toobublik> @itsmereversecorey says in the stream title
[2023-01-10 00:01:04] <mbgmatt> Try to disinfect your clothes?
[2023-01-10 00:01:04] <%JUSTmorgz> It was the chicken you ate with bloody hands‚Ä¶not the pork. Youre good
[2023-01-10 00:01:08] <%+king_daddy_james> Contaminated
[2023-01-10 00:01:10] <+SGR_Renegade> I feel like the only reasonable answer is it was the same piece of food, yeah.
[2023-01-10 00:01:11] <ukmodded> finally got to catch a stream
[2023-01-10 00:01:11] <Peajib> It came back as soon as you fell out of the deer stand, I dont think you had eaten it again yet
[2023-01-10 00:01:12] <%+Naamiiz> @itsmereversecorey Takistan
[2023-01-10 00:01:13] <islandsasquatch> its cuz you touch yourself at night
[2023-01-10 00:01:13] <%+museabear> cross contamination
[2023-01-10 00:01:16] <%+stabd_kefke> @itsmereversecorey undepandent on map. just wiki says. but anyways. as it was said its outdated
[2023-01-10 00:01:17] <angelhdior> same goes for bottles of water
[2023-01-10 00:01:17] <SpartanJack_> that makes sense

[2023-01-10 00:01:50] <finSeiryu> can you see the exact player count on the serverlist? like for example 7 or so instead of just low?
[2023-01-10 00:01:51] <+thewatchingmanZ> great thing to know when giving food to "friends" bahahaha @therunningmanz
[2023-01-10 00:01:51] <+twitch__trinity> Omg its the first time ive caught your
[2023-01-10 00:01:51] <%$sidneyp> Can you fix it?
[2023-01-10 00:02:04] <angelhdior> @baufender you must pay for livonia. the rest are for free on PC with the steam workshop
[2023-01-10 00:02:06] <%+galasteve> @deadfethr OG?  You‚Äôre fucked then

[2023-01-10 00:02:21] <%$sidneyp> Arr ok
[2023-01-10 00:02:25] <%+ChrystalStar> @baufender the only map you need to pay for outside the basic game is Livonia. all other are included
[2023-01-10 00:02:26] <%+IIIArchonIII> @finSeiryu yes depending on your launcher
[2023-01-10 00:02:27] <$deadfethr> mrogLol mrogLol mrogLol mrogLol
[2023-01-10 00:02:32] <%+futurepaprika> only bob the builder can fix it

[2023-01-10 00:02:34] <+bl0c_kev> Yes at @finseiryu
[2023-01-10 00:02:35] <ballinbig2001> Same with water bottles so if you have a water container that you drank out of after you were sick and you need chlorine tabs or to toss it too from my understanding
[2023-01-10 00:02:35] <angelhdior> has the whole stream been on takistan? crazy
[2023-01-10 00:02:37] <%+Cade_404> How big is this map compared to others? It‚Äôs the only map I‚Äôve not played
[2023-01-10 00:02:44] <clydenkids> people can't read
[2023-01-10 00:02:46] <%big_kev_12> but the charcoal tabs have been near your sick mouth
[2023-01-10 00:02:47] <kaosfeare> Pretty sure that eating the food while sick also continuously re-infects yourself, making drugs take longer to cure it, try not eating for a while but taking the charcoal :P
[2023-01-10 00:02:49] <duur__> post-apocalyptic Italy!!  ;D
[2023-01-10 00:02:49] <baufender> ty guys
[2023-01-10 00:02:50] <skitle23> so I just finished ur 2part series with namalsk and what u did to the French guy leaving him in lantia was pretty funny ending up with his loot
[2023-01-10 00:02:52] <%justth4tip> @futurepaprika yes he can
[2023-01-10 00:02:53] <%+Cov3ringFire> You've been sick for over an hour

[2023-01-10 00:02:56] <+taterstix> this map is brutal
[2023-01-10 00:02:57] <%alskieee> gonna play stalker 2 when it comes out? I know you like the multiplayer games though.

[2023-01-10 00:05:07] <+DiggleBic> Livonia was fun for what it‚Äôs worth
[2023-01-10 00:05:11] <angelhdior> takistan would be way better if it had a form of loot progression. now you can spawn next to huge militaries and get a gun before you find clothes or food more often than not
[2023-01-10 00:05:13] <JastxnTG> would you guys recommend buying livonia as a newish player
[2023-01-10 00:05:18] <%$twitchy_noob> For some reason I cant access Official servers from Steam anymore. I can only play DayZ thru the  launcher?

[2023-01-10 00:05:36] <+DiggleBic> Better yet, official was fun for what it‚Äôs worth
[2023-01-10 00:05:41] <colorcolour_music> @JastxnTG buy it when its on sale
[2023-01-10 00:05:43] <islandsasquatch> yes livonia is gorgeous, love the overgrown areas
[2023-01-10 00:05:49] <%$twitchy_noob> No loot and tons of zeds
[2023-01-10 00:05:52] <%+galasteve> @skitle23 it‚Äôs not a blood infection
[2023-01-10 00:05:53] <SwayzeNRoadhouse> Going from console to pc is a wild, there are so many options and servers to play
[2023-01-10 00:05:55] <+SGR_Renegade> @jastxntg I really enjoy Livonia, but tbh I find it harder to survive on, at least as a new player. How long you played?
[2023-01-10 00:06:03] <+NpcPleb> HB was finding a lot of stuff in towns today
[2023-01-10 00:06:05] <JastxnTG> @colorcolour_music was planning on either that or cdkeys if they have it

[2023-01-10 00:06:18] <angelhdior> yeah, theres barely any reason to visit the normal villages and towns, which are imo the coolest part of the map
[2023-01-10 00:06:20] <%justth4tip> @skitle23 u need alcohol or iodine, or disinfectant
[2023-01-10 00:06:22] <%+REEDY_Y> I hate the scope on mosin
[2023-01-10 00:06:23] <blueflame1216> no hunting rifles technically

[2023-01-10 00:06:26] <%$twitchy_noob> very few civilian weapons
[2023-01-10 00:06:30] <baufender> there are like 4 diferent Takistan in steam workshop wich is the good one?
[2023-01-10 00:06:44] <%$buck_nut82> @TheRunningManZ To much sand in the boots on this server for me. lol
[2023-01-10 00:06:45] <JastxnTG> @SGR_Renegade just under 50 hours, played all chernarus so far
[2023-01-10 00:06:45] <+lumpen101> i guess on a map like this its ok not to find a longrange gun so easy...
[2023-01-10 00:06:47] <%+DarnellJenkins> @baufender the one with players
[2023-01-10 00:06:49] <+Campincam> they actually ran away
[2023-01-10 00:06:50] <%+zillerrages> I love this map it's the desert vibe I enjoy.
[2023-01-10 00:06:50] <%+Cov3ringFire> They are waiting on the other hills for anyone going in.
[2023-01-10 00:06:51] <%+soxes_> it was full
[2023-01-10 00:06:54] <Kobasiburek> I thought by the end of Takisan's prime (you already stopped playing iirc) they added more chances of things like Mosins and other basic loot spawning in houses @TheRunningManZ
[2023-01-10 00:07:03] <+grrrdoggy> well 2023 is looking up for me, just landed a job as a prison guard, poacher tirned gamekeeper kind of situation lol
[2023-01-10 00:07:07] <@%^Nightbot> TRMZ releases a new video every week on YT, you can go and see highlights of his adventures here: youtube.com/therunningmanz
[2023-01-10 00:07:09] <%+galasteve> @jastxntg yea - if it‚Äôs on sale.  Don‚Äôt just buy it for the sake of it.    But as renegade said - i think it‚Äôs slightly harder than Cherno.  Less food readily available.
[2023-01-10 00:07:11] <chockelord> launcher will download the mods for u
[2023-01-10 00:07:11] <+SGR_Renegade> @swayzenroadhouse I put in almost 3000 hours before moving to PC, and it felt like a completely different game, lol

[2023-01-10 00:07:51] <JastxnTG> @galasteve yeah hunting would play a bigger part in livonia then im guessing?

[2023-01-10 00:30:41] <reveruof> Load your launcher x.x
[2023-01-10 00:30:48] <%+sweet_bro> last night I found about 20 improvised shelters with about 60 wooden crates deep in the woods, not much loot sadly
[2023-01-10 00:31:04] <%+Delta1292> its just in the town to the north afaik
[2023-01-10 00:31:05] <slargo83> It's a conspiracy
[2023-01-10 00:31:09] <colorcolour_music> @jwalk200 thats litterally the other side of the map lol
[2023-01-10 00:31:12] <+komikxx> @therunningmanz   Wasn‚Äôt that a map in your bag?
[2023-01-10 00:31:13] <Chardp> I think there are wells in most of the surrounding towns
[2023-01-10 00:31:15] <reveruof> I‚Äôm always late
[2023-01-10 00:31:18] <chockelord> most legumes do right? like bean peas etc
[2023-01-10 00:31:21] <%+huxka> so animals can eat them, and poop them out to plant a new peanut plant somewhere else
[2023-01-10 00:31:23] <%+museabear> that the beo wolf
[2023-01-10 00:31:24] <%+Delta1292> was playing takistan earlier
[2023-01-10 00:31:25] <+thewatchingmanZ> REAL question is why does my ballsack have a seam?!?!? @therunningmanz
[2023-01-10 00:31:26] <donparvo1> @TheRunningManZ because i like peanuts
[2023-01-10 00:31:27] <adallinn> did I hear movement
[2023-01-10 00:31:28] <%$cpplaystoomuch> So that It‚Äôs easy to eat. Animals eat the nuts, travel a ways, poop it out, and a new plant grows
[2023-01-10 00:31:28] <+rossellcrowe69> Are there modded guns going on here?
[2023-01-10 00:31:30] <+jwalk200> oh in the north
[2023-01-10 00:31:32] <%+galasteve> @donparvo1 it must be a evolutionary thing.  I‚Äôd suspect that each side of the pea nut is a separate seed.
[2023-01-10 00:31:35] <IndigoWendigo> is it worth damaging the shoes to ruin insulation?

[2023-01-10 15:54:23] <%VictorSpoilz> Hi Paul, Hi chat. Love spending the day here
[2023-01-10 15:54:26] <FactzFPS> wow you have a twitch? bro ive seen you youtube videos and watch them for over 3 years now lol!
[2023-01-10 15:54:27] <%+EnTeric_> Hey Paul hey Chat @TheRunningManZ
[2023-01-10 15:54:31] <NiveaForMen10> so satan the mouse and father of all lies is gonna be upset about this one. but in Jesus Christ's Mighty Name, lucifer the false light has no control over your thoughts, and Jesus Our Mighty Risen Saviour wants you to know that He Loves all of you very deeply.
[2023-01-10 15:54:37] <%GamesByAndy> Geared like this, with my luck, I would step on a land mine going in a door. It happens.
[2023-01-10 15:54:37] <%+proud_faither> caps lock :)  just saying thanks for relieving the boredom of work

[2023-01-10 15:54:52] <+bilsty24> hey man. only just started playing dayz about a week ago and can't survive longer then an hour due to starvation. I'm only playing on vanilla official servers.
[2023-01-10 15:54:52] <%JUSTmorgz> Just seen your tweet, Way to show some dignity and grace in the matter my dude
[2023-01-10 15:55:05] <capit0m> @profilets that is something to yell and get excited about :)

[2023-01-10 15:55:10] <NiveaForMen10> Repentance is hard at first, it certainly was for me, but i promise all of you it is so very worth it. Even when you mess up Jesus is there to quickly forgive. Thank You Jesus!
[2023-01-10 15:55:11] <@%Unclefood> @reptar346 Not at all, the in-game launcher does the same. You just have to pick a server and let the either of them do all the downloading of mods/maps on their own
[2023-01-10 15:55:20] <%+miragemillenium> Hi Paul, sorry can't join the live stream, still catching up on your past streams.

[2023-01-10 18:05:54] <+jbuckaloo> You can make your tea and use the loo at the desk with that pc
[2023-01-10 18:06:00] <+gizmo2019> try wickes, same carcasses as magnet but slightly less range
[2023-01-10 18:06:01] <%bayou28> It will help the resale value
[2023-01-10 18:06:01] <%+Ryan493> I get that it feels expensive. But that‚Äôs very normal for an average kitchen. Hopefully you find something less price that‚Äôs still quality

[2023-01-10 18:06:40] <HemiEVO3> As for peripherals, you really don't need high-dollar stuff. You can get along just fine with a $15 keyboard as an example

[2023-01-10 18:06:48] <%+skizem_> IKEA kitchens are actually decent. My partner sees a lot of them in her work, no@complaints from the owners.

[2023-01-10 18:06:54] <%PinziDinio> I agree, induction is a nightmare. Pans don't heat evenly.
[2023-01-10 18:06:55] <%+123pswinn> Wren has some good offers
[2023-01-10 18:06:55] <+drewb007> Howdens are usually pretty reasonable

[2023-01-10 18:07:02] <stangdennis> there is nothing wrong with it, people just have a preference some times.
[2023-01-10 18:07:04] <%+GreenOrcGaming> I have induction, its fine.  Don't let them steer you away from it.

[2023-01-10 18:07:10] <alistaircobb> Induction is ok but don‚Äôt you need special saucepans ?
[2023-01-10 18:07:11] <%lurl0> i bet, @TheRunningManZ ,if you'd ask, all your mods would happily build you a new kitchen... :D
[2023-01-10 18:07:13] <%+abaiostr> Get one that doesn‚Äôt turn off when you lift the pan, that‚Äôs annoying
[2023-01-10 18:07:13] <AkimboMyGherkin> So if your hands are full, and you need to turn off the induction stove on the fast, it can get a bit annoying for me IMO
[2023-01-10 18:07:15] <%hyperpro8> @therunningmanz you not had a look at any small local businesses? they'll probably be cheaper and do a better job than the big guns like wren, Howdens and so on, might be worth calling round

[2023-01-10 18:07:22] <%lolena94> I love my induction.. most pots and pans work.

[2023-01-10 18:07:28] <+desolate_master> induction is great as long as you remember to turn it of and don't leave something metallic on the hob (burnt my induction teapot twice now turning the wrong hob on)

[2023-01-10 18:07:41] <%impipapo> Induction is great. We have one and the cold water boils after like 1.5 minutes max. They‚Äôre really good. Also it does have a boost modus to get to the cooking stage even quicker
[2023-01-10 18:07:42] <%+jkutastrofik> I had one for years and had to keep on replacing pots and pans to work with induction. Even then some that were induction pans stopped working after some time @TheRunningManZ
[2023-01-10 18:07:42] <fredothefrogo> find a reputable carpenter/cabinet maker local and get some quotes also better quality and probably similar or better price

[2023-01-10 18:10:09] <+komikxx> Years ago, here in the States, there were a series of automobile advertisements featuring ‚ÄúJoe Isuzu‚Äù. Absolutely hilarious. Everything he said was wildly false, extreme exaggerations.
[2023-01-10 18:10:11] <+superketchup_> I just think induction is cool. It's more efficient and faster. Plus magnets
[2023-01-10 18:10:11] <ben_monster88> I got our kitchen through Howdens. Ask them what they will give you as part of the kitchen if you buy it now i.e free oven. I've also been told that they will contact the trades person and ask if they want anything added on top of the price of the kitchen, giving the trades person more profit
[2023-01-10 18:10:19] <$smokeybarr> @desolate_master Electric is significantly more expensive in the UK ATM

[2023-01-10 18:10:28] <stangdennis> you guys make it sound like induction is horrible. truth is that almost all pan you buy today can handle all types of heating devices from gas to regular stove to induction
[2023-01-10 18:10:33] <%+LuisLIberty13> Where im from everyone uses electric stoves and have for as long as i can remember

[2023-01-10 18:13:02] <$smokeybarr> @desolate_master True. I'm hoping to rig my shed, with all my computer gear, running 100% on Solar this year.
[2023-01-10 18:13:02] <braodsword> The same with Wickes
[2023-01-10 18:13:03] <+DufMonkey> They also base the price on how much howdens kit the fitter buys in a year,
[2023-01-10 18:13:05] <%petr_pan> my company produces the edge band for howdens. ^^

[2023-01-10 18:53:28] <vquestyy> Wait. So in uk the company you work for dont put away some % off your monthly pay to an pention account? With Twitch your self Employed i guess. In Norway every company desides how many % they will give.

[2023-01-10 18:53:55] <%+EzyC_Ire> I have 24% going to pension, and I bet it will be worth f all when I retire‚Ä¶. Financial services are the biggest scam.  Banks make profit but be sure we will all be told our pensions have lost money in the past 12 months!
[2023-01-10 18:53:58] <%+TheTorlay> @vquestyy yes in the UK it is law now that your employer pays into a pension fund

[2023-01-10 18:55:43] <$johnniegoode> U.S. law allows up to 6% to be put into what we call a 401k account and most companies will match it after 4 or 5 years with the company.
[2023-01-10 18:55:43] <yankees1jr> @blazincutty yeah I‚Äôd gladly have traded away the mathematics classes I‚Äôve never once used for a financial literacy class
[2023-01-10 18:55:43] <+boloco08> Mine will match up to 5%
[2023-01-10 18:55:45] <Breadley_OW> @vquestyy That sounds amazing. In Germany, you have to contribute even though you likely won't ever see that money again
[2023-01-10 18:55:45] <%+InZanebc> @naturallight863 if you put in and they match 6%. that's better than any savings account and as good as a conservative portfolio in the markets

[2023-01-10 18:57:36] <+desolate_master> another good idea is not voting idiots into power that think using the pension fund as their own slush fund

Minus your start up costs for a kiln etc. You can do nothing but make profit on merch. Decals on cups can be bought by the thousands for nearly nothing.

[2023-01-10 19:59:29] <+galadhrim1982> IN fact I am a lawyer in Belgium. Defamation, public insults, and calomny are criminal infractions who needs the material and intentional elements. The Prosecution need to proof that you knew what you were doing. To be a defamation you need to proof that : 1. the allegation is false. 2. it causes damage to the victim and her honor. A moral person (company associations etc) cannot be defamed by an individual, but can be by another moral person. Sorry for the brick.

[2023-01-10 20:37:37] <%+medic361> @generalsmiles1 But the Mosin is not the most accurate rifle in the world. Actually you are lucky to get an accurate Mosin. The Kar98 is a precision weapon, and power only matters if the round hits.

[2023-01-10 21:43:43] <@%^Nightbot> Take time exploring the map, don't worry about getting all the loots. Follow roads or power lines to towns, find a road sign with a towns name and use an external map to navigate with !maps. Stay warm and dry! Zombies often have food, drinks and tools on them. If you aren't finding loot in a town someone might have just been through it, move on to the next town. Always remember that gear comes and goes, everyone dies, and to Have Fun!

[2023-01-10 23:12:07] <%Viking_Saint> FAL should hit harder with the 308 and IF it had a longer barrel it would be better
