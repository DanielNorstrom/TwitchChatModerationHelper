[2022-12-17 23:45:11] <Jimmy_Page_> meati do you think we will ever see big streamers compete at worlds? are those guys just at another skill level?
[2022-12-17 23:45:25] <陰謀斯 (inmos1316)> Is this the t1 deck now?
[2022-12-17 23:45:36] <supermozek_> who do you support to win worlds?
[2022-12-17 23:45:48] <Jimmy_Page_> i think it would be a lot more exciting for us to see you feno thijs compete at worlds
[2022-12-17 23:46:13] <eklooster> How does 5 hours old trouser popcorn taste?

[2022-12-17 23:46:49] <helmetwearer> also as the skill level of the competition increases the skill edges you can gain diminishes
[2022-12-17 23:46:55] <bitbangboom> line ups matter
[2022-12-17 23:47:07] <TheRealMeyerYT> feno is for sure the best

[2022-12-17 23:47:18] <Jimmy_Page_> @MeatiHS how come DK has a 8 drop minion that destroys the board but warriors 8 drop only deals 5 dmg and got a nerf bc it gave too much armor?
[2022-12-17 23:47:38] <supermozek_> but is it a coincidence for some players to be multiple times at worlds?
[2022-12-17 23:47:38] <pepefrogqt> @Jimmy_Page_  blizzard logic
[2022-12-17 23:47:47] <kazikazinova> greetings man. whats up?
[2022-12-17 23:47:52] <helmetwearer> like at a certain point you have to assume your opponent is going to play their hand flawlessly on average
[2022-12-17 23:47:54] <+bluedevilblue> And DK is still underpowered in this meta.  That's how under Warrior is.
[2022-12-17 23:47:55] <kazikazinova> hey chat
[2022-12-17 23:48:05] <az0rrr> @supermozek_ multiple high rolls DansGame
[2022-12-17 23:48:06] <+jamezuva> what do u think they'll do to make DK competitive
[2022-12-17 23:48:12] <pepefrogqt> dk has no highrolling no mana cheating, so it wont be good for a while
[2022-12-17 23:48:23] <Jimmy_Page_> they can make dk competitive by nerfing all the mana cheat classes
[2022-12-17 23:48:25] <Jimmy_Page_> leave dk alone
[2022-12-17 23:48:26] <Jimmy_Page_> its good

[2022-12-17 23:49:01] <klowd92> How did he know its not counter spell just YOLO'd it omg
[2022-12-17 23:49:02] <%+apexwarden> There is like an instinct of knowing when to play what. It resembles the same instinct in pro poker players
[2022-12-17 23:49:02] <陰謀斯 (inmos1316)> Lul
[2022-12-17 23:49:07] <@Norwis_> @supermozek_ no its clearly that they play better than anyone else, bcs there is nothing like exceptions to the rules in big amount of data
[2022-12-17 23:49:42] <+Muyyyyyyy> Cannot wait for completely irrelevant warrior cards to be buffed.
[2022-12-17 23:49:56] <supermozek_> @Norwis_ then why didn't you win worlds multiple times yet
[2022-12-17 23:50:01] <+goudaboi> The whole point is to get 1 mana harvester of envy since you dont play renathal
[2022-12-17 23:50:16] <piQmi> piqmiHEY piqmiHEY piqmiHEY piqmiHEY piqmiHEY piqmiHEY
[2022-12-17 23:50:26] <Jimmy_Page_> did u guys see worlds when that guy missed lethal bc he didnt play 2nd bran for triple alextraza?

[2022-12-17 23:50:47] <squirrel_swans> @goudaboi so prince renathal is unplayable in this deck?
[2022-12-17 23:50:56] <astrojoinths> WTF is that card. Discard a spell? thats OP as fuck
[2022-12-17 23:51:08] <+Moophisto> suck that asstalor
[2022-12-17 23:51:15] <+thugpunn> yeah, low rolled classes LUL
[2022-12-17 23:51:21] <+Muyyyyyyy> Next patch better let you discover which you want to discard
[2022-12-17 23:51:29] <lolblinny> srs tho such a cool card
[2022-12-17 23:51:32] <@Norwis_> @supermozek_ you apparently didnt understand my answer
[2022-12-17 23:51:36] <%+apexwarden> @jimmy_page_ does not work 1x brann max
[2022-12-17 23:51:39] <helmetwearer> what about all the amazing new fire warrior cards? KEKW
[2022-12-17 23:52:06] <curtarc> At this point I think even if they fully reverted From the Depths and Nellie, Warrior would still be trash
[2022-12-17 23:52:22] <Jimmy_Page_> just make nellie good again
[2022-12-17 23:52:34] <Jimmy_Page_> start with nellie
[2022-12-17 23:52:38] <Jimmy_Page_> idk about from the depths
[2022-12-17 23:52:41] <EloGiggIe> do we want more scams in the game

[2022-12-17 23:52:53] <EloGiggIe> ok :)
[2022-12-17 23:52:55] <helmetwearer> if they want to improve warrior they can't do it with this expansion's cards that's for sure
[2022-12-17 23:52:57] <@Norwis_> just revert the nerfs at shitt classes and dont nerf rest Keepo
[2022-12-17 23:53:03] <+SDJ_NL> Nellie revert would be a Rogue buff more than anything
[2022-12-17 23:53:17] <%ChrisIsError_> meatman still confident this deck can win meatiKing
[2022-12-17 23:53:22] <youngmoneygangsterqq> do you think warrior is unfixable at this point since they neglected it for so long
[2022-12-17 23:53:27] <Jimmy_Page_> do you think we will see a lorthemar meta happen this expansion?
[2022-12-17 23:53:35] <curtarc> I mean, you only win in HS if you scam. Warrior and DK are classes that don't scam and that is why they are bad right now
[2022-12-17 23:53:39] <@Norwis_> @ChrisIsError_ yeah I cant see what it beats except bad dk players
[2022-12-17 23:53:47] <drenkk> @meatihs finally some good deck to watch for stream, wp
[2022-12-17 23:53:47] <+bluedevilblue> DR Rogue would be bad, I think since no silence.
[2022-12-17 23:53:47] <pepefrogqt> deathrattle rog is impossible for blood dk too
[2022-12-17 23:53:54] <pepefrogqt> only priest can beat deathrattle rog
[2022-12-17 23:54:07] <+Moophisto> @pepefrogqt nah, just put in a smothering starfish or two
[2022-12-17 23:54:07] <+seyfee> I've been playing a control warrior deck climbing from diamond 5 and it's not bad. auto win to aggro runs the silence all minion and the double stats legendary
[2022-12-17 23:54:16] <@Norwis_> @DanTheGreat94 should we do predictions?

[2022-12-17 23:54:21] <pepefrogqt> @Moophisto  starfish doesnt help vs rogue because they have endless supply of deathrattles
[2022-12-17 23:54:21] <Jimmy_Page_> priest can only beat dr rogue if it has the two card combo of silence and mass aoe
[2022-12-17 23:54:34] <+Moophisto> @pepefrogqt My Blood dkstats since I added double starfish says otherwise
