[2023-01-01 15:11:30] <%Foxx_1111> you can set it up before the battle
[2023-01-01 15:11:30] <+ZTAXZ> It's like a lose-lose situation for us.
[2023-01-01 15:11:30] <!%+Gavstrav> on scoreboard attacker is left side i think

[2023-01-01 15:12:00] <JalleyKing> I don't like this even fight
[2023-01-01 15:12:09] <Rusynchen> why not? it says you get them if you lead the troops uk?
[2023-01-01 15:12:10] <DrWeirdness> But why would it say "you are mounted" just for fun?
[2023-01-01 15:12:15] <%viktor_mehl> just dont die so the infantry doesnt loose the bonus
[2023-01-01 15:12:16] <%c0sma23> ur  army can win the battle but dont die tommy if u die u get massive debuffs
[2023-01-01 15:12:18] <Blue_Badger> keep archers behind sheild wall
[2023-01-01 15:12:19] <JalleyKing> kinda risky
[2023-01-01 15:12:22] <Mommy_Misato> Put your archers in the rear or on a hill.
[2023-01-01 15:12:24] <+Chemexy> use the hills
[2023-01-01 15:12:29] <%+KaasKikkerKoning> @TommyKayLIVE Since soldiers wear shields on the left, try positioning your archers on the right flank of your enemies
[2023-01-01 15:12:30] <%pootis_poow> use the river thoman.... use the river
[2023-01-01 15:12:31] <%+Cipher343> use the river and the hills
[2023-01-01 15:12:33] <imel290912> i think you should place the archer side enemy flank when the infantry engage
[2023-01-01 15:12:34] <%Sparxz7> holding the hill is best
[2023-01-01 15:12:35] <%f0reignerX> @TommyKayLIVE see if you can place them there
[2023-01-01 15:12:36] <%c0sma23> yes

[2023-01-01 15:12:38] <%M1t___> try it
[2023-01-01 15:12:38] <%IchHoax> Retreat to river

[2023-01-01 15:13:37] <+aRocku> As far as i know make the Archer a 2man line so both lines are shooting
[2023-01-01 15:13:38] <kuba_96> @TommyKayLIVE Same strength but during deployment commander with lower tactic skill  will have less people initially deployed. This is called battle advantage. Every 2 tactics increase 1 lvl of thisadvantage
[2023-01-01 15:13:41] <%krankegurkeggc> @TommyKayLIVE maybe even defend near the river so the enemy have to stand in the river while fighting, makes it easier to hit them with arrows
[2023-01-01 15:13:45] <%h_y_s> get them from the hills
[2023-01-01 15:13:46] <%f_art999> I have a bad feeling about this

[2023-01-01 15:40:43] <CoatCheese> @TommyKayLIVE  Same strength on the map but during deployment commander with lower tactic skill  will have less troops initially deployed. You can see in bar at the top that opponent have higher tactics. This is called battle advantage.

[2023-01-01 15:58:30] <+le_biceps_de_socks> @TommyKayLIVE first you have a lot of charm, then you want to increase relations with nobles, the best way i found is actually free them from a jail. When you have a lot of relations with them you actually have to talk with them and pass 'the mini-game' where you re talking with them and there is multiples choices. If you manage to succes this charm check you can add them to your clan
[2023-01-01 15:58:30] <%Foxx_1111> @TommyKayLIVE  you can also starve them out

[2023-01-01 18:26:07] <%thestranger216> Can other factors play a role, ex. Honor? (Gained by releasing lords after battle)
[2023-01-01 18:26:08] <Hasmete> maybe you can trade with them for relation
[2023-01-01 18:26:21] <%Lightru> The lords without castles will want to join you
