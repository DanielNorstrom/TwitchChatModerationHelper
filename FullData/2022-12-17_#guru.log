[2022-12-17 08:40:44] <%+igotnothing11732> as a kiriko main I think suzu needs a longer cooldown, as does swift step. Suzu should give invulnerability for only .5 of a second, and ult charge needs to be nerfed a little that would make her a bit more tuned

[2022-12-17 08:42:06] <!%Hippyzilla> Sometimes, whenever I eat M&Ms, I like to hold two M&Ms in between my fingers and squeeze as hard as I can until one M&M cracks. I eat the cracked one, and the one that didn't crack becomes the champion. Then I grab the other M&M, and force it to compete with the champion in this deadly game of M&M gladiators. I do this until I run out of M&Ms, and when there is only one M&M left standing.
