[2022-12-31 13:58:09] <@%QuackSage> ceiling/room mic is an option, but for cooking you need a mic nearer your mouth or sounds will drown you out

[2022-12-31 14:09:19] <totkeks> who are we talking about?
[2022-12-31 14:09:24] <+uP_Ildurnest> My mature (i'm kinda older) opinion on all this is summed by the fact that the deconstruction of the patriarchal and misogynistic society that was created for 2000 years that is taking place right now did not take into account the place, wants, and needs of young men. And that is why A.Tate exists.
[2022-12-31 14:09:53] <Jellooze> He've done enough shit to warrant that opinion, new sentence or not

[2022-12-31 14:14:03] <ak0ng> We can also speculate as much as we want on a person's involvement in crime. It doesn't affect the sentencing in any way. Should we only be able to discuss something once a sentence has been passed?
[2022-12-31 14:14:05] <Ragnarskar> There is a reason why "Innocent until proven guilty" is law and not the court of public opinion

[2022-12-31 14:22:27] <ak0ng> Has anyone gone to jail for misgendering? Because it seems to me, that Jordan Peterson has caused backlash, that has brought way more harm than the bill.

[2022-12-31 14:24:13] <ak0ng> It's important to have a disucssion regarding law, but Jordan Peterson has basically started a cult - that cult is responsible for direct physical harm to transgender people. That is not just discussion. That is not just "asking questions", as he would put it.
[2022-12-31 14:24:51] <+Krlymn7> It's not wrong tho. His fans have became a cult like entity. They will blindly champion him no matter what he says
[2022-12-31 14:24:53] <progoldfish1> @SteezyKam I agree he does. but I wouldnt say not too listen to him AT ALL though.

[2022-12-31 14:39:56] <ak0ng> In my opinion, his views seem to stem from a religious background, which he has struggled to formulate in a way that hides the religious upbringing. If he doesn't, he risks alienating the areligious.

[2022-12-31 14:48:20] <ak0ng> I've met my 2 most recent girlfriends on dating platforms. I'm not an outstanding specimen. You are correct, that men get discarded way more often than women, but might there be a difference in how men and women use dating platforms? And is any method inherently wrong?

[2022-12-31 14:51:20] <AshraGunn> It's a delicate discussion which is hard to talk about on the internet between a streamer and chat tbh. It's something I have been following for many years. Betinna Ardnt for example talks about how men and women communicate intimately etc.

[2022-12-31 14:52:32] <ak0ng> Is it maybe a natural difference in the way we approach relationships? Are men not more likely to be less critical, because they can spread their seed further. If the relationship doesn't work, they move on to the next. Women are more inclined to lkook for the perfect mate, who they will spend the rest of their life with. It obviously doesn't gel with todays society where relationships are more "Permanent".

[2022-12-31 15:08:05] <Terradoss> There's a lot to be said for personal responsibility in managing our own interpersonal behaviours, but personal responsibility cannot resolve systemic or societal issues on its own. Collective responsibility is likewise important, and I find the latter is often overlooked in preference of focusing on the former. Sometimes its bigger than a person just needing to "do better".

[2022-12-31 15:31:31] <kelbie_> i wish the internet would teach less about self empowerment being the only solution and instead encourage community. I think that's how those groups around Tate, Musk, etc blow up because since they are deemed outcast they are now a community of outcast.
[2022-12-31 15:31:43] <%pdiddly63> the rhetoric of "pull yourself up by the boot straps" despite your ailments is utterly childish
[2022-12-31 15:32:02] <ak0ng> Everyone is different. Acknowledging differences is not "Making excuses". It's accepting reality. No one is "Normal".

I feel bad when using my illness even when I genuinely should use it.

[2022-12-31 15:52:32] <AshraGunn> Yeah, I agree. I do the same!

[2022-12-31 15:52:43] <ak0ng> People don't want to be defined by their illness, but it is absolutely fair, that there are some things you can't do because of your illness. There are a bunch of things I can't do, because of a myriad of reasons. Most are a lack of ability, but that is also a valid excuse.
[2022-12-31 15:52:57] <Jellooze> mhm there are some trends on tiktok n stuff where people glorify their mental illness
[2022-12-31 15:53:18] <Jellooze> in a kinda unhealthy way

[2022-12-31 15:53:42] <Overload42> I have chronic depression that was only diagnosed when I was 40. Even today, and with a treatment that works in making me go about my life, I still hide it from everybody, even from my therapist
[2022-12-31 15:54:18] <ChomskysGaming> outside help is super important
[2022-12-31 15:54:18] <AshraGunn> As in there are two definitions. I guess I didn't argue my point effectively. As I haven't disagreed with anything you said.
[2022-12-31 15:54:39] <Jellooze> @Overload42 you know yourself best, but you shouldnt keep it hidden from your therapist. you pay them to be able to talk to them about that sort of stuff

[2022-12-31 16:14:07] <%Wakadodo> @ak0ng Generally this is my method for discussions. You dont get presented with information that completely breaks down your ideology about a thing, you get inspired/interested in a critique about one of its nuances. And then your previous stance and new information coalesce  and mature together.
[2022-12-31 16:14:11] <AshraGunn> Chess is also about just playing the game for many hours to see patterns etc.
[2022-12-31 16:14:18] <madz9r> only know responses to the common ones
[2022-12-31 16:14:53] <ak0ng> @Wakadodo Absolutely. I guess it is just hard to keep that in mind during a discussion. To step out of "defensive mode".
[2022-12-31 16:15:04] <Qamz> chess is more fun if you go into it without the book reading first.

[2022-12-31 17:54:12] <eleveneighteen> the best thing about owning a house is it always has the value of a house. no matter what happens with the cash value you always need a roof

[2022-12-31 17:54:39] <@%+DerangedM8> buying house yields more
[2022-12-31 17:54:51] <Potenns> @DerangedM8 depends where you live
[2022-12-31 17:54:51] <Kingeraser> @DerangedM8 isnt that a take from 10 years ago
[2022-12-31 17:54:56] <Potenns> Have a wonderful switch into the next year everyone!
[2022-12-31 17:54:56] <%herxtheslayer> renting means you're paying the house for someone else
[2022-12-31 17:54:57] <ryuukk__> rent, and invest in housing
[2022-12-31 17:55:02] <%herxtheslayer> you get nothing out of it
[2022-12-31 17:55:03] <@%+DerangedM8> what if the stock you invest in crashes?
[2022-12-31 17:55:09] <@%+DerangedM8> goes both ways
[2022-12-31 17:55:26] <AshraGunn> rent to be as much as a mortgage from my experience. Renting is good for travelling/moving places, Mortgage is a more permanent commitment to settling down.
[2022-12-31 17:55:27] <+Slackalot88> has housing ever gone down in the long term..
[2022-12-31 17:55:29] <+Neurodrive101> How bad are property taxes in your area? I may almost as much in taxes as my mortgage.
[2022-12-31 17:55:31] <Kingeraser> owning a house is only good if you want to live there your whole life
[2022-12-31 17:55:55] <ryuukk__> buying means you have taxes and have to comply with what ever new rules they will put on you "solar panel, energy efficiency etc etc", lot of money to waste

[2022-12-31 17:56:29] <@%+DerangedM8> house will generally keep worth, they vary about 20k maybe in general, you pay it over time, the money you have extra you invest, morgage payments will generally be as much as rent anyways
[2022-12-31 17:56:34] <Boomer_pl> Buy an apartment meet a girl make 4 kids live a stress-free life :tf:
[2022-12-31 17:57:00] <SpritZzz> well rent give nothing the day you move out anyway. but a house where you pay off the mortgage is money to you the day you sell it vs a aprtment where it os 0 when you leave and in many chases you can get a house for cheaper each month vs the rent
[2022-12-31 17:57:31] <Kingeraser> you can invest the money u save by renting
[2022-12-31 17:57:31] <@%+DerangedM8> rent is almost as expensive as morgage
[2022-12-31 17:57:55] <Kingeraser> u dont own the house untill the loan is paid off
[2022-12-31 17:58:02] <+Miconaz> thats why you either move or renovate when you almost pay off the morgage
[2022-12-31 17:58:24] <eleveneighteen> I feel like the only time real estate is a bad investment is if the population is declining. I think rural italy is currently having that porblem

[2022-12-31 17:58:26] <@oxblood_> There are plenty of energy incentives available either at no interest or very little, but you're absolutely at the mercy of your landlord unless you own your own home.
[2022-12-31 17:58:28] <AshraGunn> Can always look at it, as buying a home than an investment.
[2022-12-31 17:58:42] <@%+DerangedM8> okay, buying house will always yield more than renting, rent is almost as expensive as morgage, when you sell your house you generally get at least 70% of what you've put in back
[2022-12-31 17:58:45] <hiram_pickles_III> hmmmm so buy cheap and sell high? maybe this could be applied to other things
[2022-12-31 17:59:12] <Kingeraser> u want solar and a battery

[2022-12-31 18:01:58] <Kingeraser> make your company own the house and pay rent towards that and declare the loan as cost
[2022-12-31 18:02:17] <ryuukk__> you can't sell a house that wasn't properly maintened and is built with old tech WRT energy savings

[2022-12-31 18:32:29] <+Arakki> they claim it's not Creation engine, but this is 100% creation engine, animation is so bethesda

[2022-12-31 18:49:27] <Meliea_EU> im tempted to buy rdr2 currently dont like cowboy that much but its on sale and the single player seems very good
[2022-12-31 18:49:51] <ak0ng> The only thing is the voice over. Doesn't feel very Homeworldy. It needs to be more grounded.
[2022-12-31 18:50:32] <AshraGunn> This Dune?
[2022-12-31 18:50:39] <ak0ng> Voice acting for both characters and radio chatter was amazing in Homeworld.

[2022-12-31 18:51:59] <%+grimrid> yep looks cool tho
[2022-12-31 18:52:16] <MrMickeyMouse> are you hype for any mmorpg ?

[2022-12-31 18:52:38] <ak0ng> They are a new studio with the original developers.
[2022-12-31 18:52:46] <ak0ng> They made Deserts of Kharak as well.

[2022-12-31 18:53:36] <ak0ng> The original was developed by Relic.
[2022-12-31 18:53:46] <ak0ng> But the developers are at BBI now.
[2022-12-31 18:54:20] <%Vosy1984> look at that 4:3

[2022-12-31 18:55:46] <ak0ng> Deserts of Kharak is a prequel. You should try it if you like Homeworld. It's not on par but it's good.

[2022-12-31 19:02:01] <+Pinz_Lament> specially for the dating
[2022-12-31 19:02:01] <+Ranaeri> You can just drive with L plates on, as long as someone is with you

[2022-12-31 19:02:42] <Ryoame_> don't you need a theoretical test to get your provisional license?
[2022-12-31 19:02:44] <+ironprophett> Yeah
[2022-12-31 19:02:46] <+Ranaeri> You need a provisional license and the person with you has to have a full license (I believe)
[2022-12-31 19:02:53] <+Th0rant> provisional license u get it but u can drive with someone else who can drive

[2022-12-31 19:07:15] <+Th0rant> manual all the way
