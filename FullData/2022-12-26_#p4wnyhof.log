[2022-12-26 08:34:36] <Marvin1511> blender is quiet easy tho. my best childhoodfriend and me held contests of who could build THE most convincing photorealistic scene in blender. i managed ti build a glass, with water pouring into it while reacting physicly correct

[2022-12-26 12:30:07] <+HindsyTF> People happily pay for a tv subscription which includes adverts but get annoyed when FREE content has adverts. Very odd

[2022-12-26 12:32:26] VIEWERS: 550
[2022-12-26 12:32:37] <AshamDukoti> The only reason, people do not like adds in Twich, is because it is the ONLY platform (mainstream platform) that does NOT pause the content when an add is playing. So basically, a couple of adds, can and WILL interrupt a whole conversation, and there is no way to get this content back.
[2022-12-26 12:32:49] <%+1wischmob1> so in good german:  du hattest kein schönes Jahr? ich wünsch dir das es nächstes jahr besser wir :-)
[2022-12-26 12:33:15] <%+1wischmob1> ok fine :-)
[2022-12-26 12:33:24] <AshamDukoti> However, it is a healthy support system, for the content creator. And we can all agree with this.
[2022-12-26 12:33:34] <rahbar2007> loved the latest gameplay youtube video <3
[2022-12-26 12:33:34] <Tewma2> Have thoroughly enjoyed your streams this year if that means anything :)
[2022-12-26 12:33:37] <%SU_Shadow> if you watch a streamer alot, sub and you will not see any adds.  If you watch alot of streamers, get twitch turbo, and never see ANY adds on twitch.
[2022-12-26 12:34:11] <kiantoilmari> Does youtube live pause when adds running and you can scroll it to "live" when you feel like is the best spot?

[2022-12-26 13:29:00] <aha45amg> 50? more like 80 its even annyoing if your teammate has it on and blocks your shots on the enemy…
[2022-12-26 13:29:01] <jsfour> Yeah should definelty be some kind of penalty
[2022-12-26 13:29:10] <+TheJuiceTV> 50% penalty seems high….  Also, shipment is a terrible experience on this game lol
