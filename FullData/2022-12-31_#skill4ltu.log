[2022-12-31 14:17:18] <creatoraxus> @skill4ltu do you think they will sell BZ later in 2023 in the premium shop like other tanks?
[2022-12-31 14:17:18] <$wolf447> I think tear 10  should have their own batles
[2022-12-31 14:17:21] <+DetectiveHoots> @skill4ltu If all players were high skilled, wot would be a sad, sad place
[2022-12-31 14:17:30] <Objec7_> but to be honest back in the day getting a tier x at first 500 battles was impossible
[2022-12-31 14:17:37] <Roasiac> So think of actual skill based match making, so create a match maker based on Personal rating so for example max 1000 rating difference and some what equal winrates so they can naturally improve through matches against equally skilled, I come from a Esports background in Apex Legends so mainly my question comes from there.
[2022-12-31 14:17:49] <Nexuss23> top player gameplay would be so boring
[2022-12-31 14:17:56] <samonator1> smurfing

[2022-12-31 14:17:57] <Eifprinter> I mean that happens either way @skill4ltu
[2022-12-31 14:18:02] <mgcola> That's SBMM. It was implemented in COD and it is currently the worst thing for matchmaking possible. if you have a good 10 game streak you will be meeting very experienced players that will outclass you in every way possible, and will incentivise players to underperform to have easier games in the future
[2022-12-31 14:18:05] <danydanny90> @skill4ltu Hey Skill. Thanks for the drops and i wish you all the best. Happy New Year

[2022-12-31 14:18:25] <+archoncommando> it would reduce that horseshit though otherwise no other game would have skilled based MM
[2022-12-31 14:18:26] <%$ItsVojta> WG has data and base to train AI. They're just too lazy @skill4ltu

[2022-12-31 14:18:34] <robemonster0210> MMR sgould be 0-4000  , 4000 - 8000, 8000 - 12000+
[2022-12-31 14:18:35] <%scritka> @skill4ltu i think skill based MM is not good... but Matchmaker should try to balance teams more. Not like one team has 3 or 4 players with higher rating than teh highest on other team
[2022-12-31 14:18:41] <SaseDegete> sure @skill4ltu but then again you can't have players with 100 PR o none side and platoons with 10k PR on the other team.. there must be some sort of balancing factor
[2022-12-31 14:18:46] <XqualDK> Happy NewYear Mr. Skill
[2022-12-31 14:18:57] <%NunexTK> skill based matchmaking is a terrible idea, id rather have matchmaking that balances tanks like having equal number of chieftains per team or something

[2022-12-31 14:19:06] <creatoraxus> @skill4ltu do you think they will sell BZ later in 2023 in the premium shop like other tanks?
[2022-12-31 14:19:26] <wizz4e> :D
[2022-12-31 14:19:26] <aIandaIa> not a skill based matchmaking but how about the tier.. example: u are tier 7.. and meet only tier 8 -7 or 6 but not 9 ... is that not right? i mean.. tier 7 against 9... is not right... :)
[2022-12-31 14:19:26] <Roasiac> SBMM should not be based I think based on your game streaks but more take in mind your overall performance and your performance over last 1000 matches and put you in matches through that system instead of putting you in horrible matches.

[2022-12-31 14:20:46] <$spysmocking> @skill4ltu hi skill how are you doing. To add onto the point from the gentelmen earlier about WoT grinding being hard. Yes it is true that back in the day it used to be way more brutal, and it is somewhat better now, but I think it is still pretty beginner unfriendly. The main reason is the premium acc. Grinding xp with stock tanks with standard acc is still so brutal, considering how a lot of tech tree branches have many unfun vehicles to play. With premium acc, it goes so much easier

[2022-12-31 14:21:30] <Roasiac> I kinda hate it players like myself who are new but dont perform well, I win on average 70% of my matches with a few exceptions once or twice a week and in a lot of these matches it the ability to turn a game around ever when you lose but a lot of players dont be unicum or have a previous experience in competiting in games on a high skill level and they just lose a lot especially when facing teams with both very skilled players and incredibly broken ruining premium tanks that fill one team.

[2022-12-31 14:23:41] <Roasiac> To me remove the premium ammo and have some actual skill involved in shooting your enemies instead of dabbing 2 key and penning easy
[2022-12-31 14:23:46] <+Pfleif> @skill4ltu but with blueprints you dont even need to play a tank
[2022-12-31 14:23:48] <%FishFashFoch> i disagree @skill4ltu i had to play stock tanks, now i want every1 else to suffer
[2022-12-31 14:23:49] <%+Mr_PoorSoul> @skill4ltu Idk but for me it looks like it is so much easier to grind xp nowadays then back in those says when i started to play... so much 5x boosters etc...

[2022-12-31 14:27:33] <Flavio93Zena> I was having shower and couldn't say anything before. In Armored Warfare we had skill based matchmaking and ALL of stream speculations were correct, plus on top of that it was matching 70% players with 30%, making it impossible to win. Absolutely awful idea.

[2022-12-31 14:27:59] <$spysmocking> @skill4ltu I have another point to make. i think when WG bring back onslaught to the game this year, they should add some gold in the list of rewards for wins or smth. Like we had in ranked for reaching division 10 in the subdivisions. And reward vehicles as the final reward. That will give players a reason to play this mode, other than for a shiny rank badge and a name on the leaderboard

[2022-12-31 17:41:42] <!%+UrKryptoknight> @stosdenfer 2 kind of but they, armored warfare and war thunder. I think armored warfare could have taken over with their pve but the investors wanted a copy pasta of WOT
[2022-12-31 17:41:42] <AzuKam31> Yes but it is an dead end for wargaming and the pllayers. It's short term money, and short term pleasur for players. One day, the game will die i guess... @skill4ltu
[2022-12-31 17:41:42] <%NunexTK> @skill4ltu agree no company is a friend of the consumer, they only care about increasing profits
[2022-12-31 17:41:43] <%srnuss72> I agree and I spend money to help me progress as i dont have enough time to grind
[2022-12-31 17:41:44] <amiramz200> good point

[2022-12-31 17:58:43] <@%$Anthraxicus> @TriMaxmus Map guides are very difficult to make and then maintain because wargaming is always changing things on maps with and without telling us about it. So skill would have to do each map, from both sides and then do that all over again after each patch. That's a crap ton of extra work that skill doesn't have time for with everything else he's doing atm.
