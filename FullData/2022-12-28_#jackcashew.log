[2022-12-28 05:11:14] <ttv_nicolette> i cant comprehend algebra
[2022-12-28 05:11:18] <%orbitpaws> trig was fun to me idk
[2022-12-28 05:11:18] <%belovedfairys> for some reason
[2022-12-28 05:11:19] <%+tv_tfol> I spent most of college figuring out what I could switch to and gave up

[2022-12-28 05:12:08] <ttv_nicolette> i dont think its the fact that people are bad at math i think its because most teachers cant explain it in a way that is easily understandable

[2022-12-28 06:13:10] <@%+allma> not enough players
[2022-12-28 06:13:26] <cr1msontaken> i would think maybe because valorant is a high precision game where as OW is constant spraying unless ur using a sniper? maybe idk i’m pretty bad on both games
[2022-12-28 06:13:29] <@%cherrysmm> no bc rank is defo team up kinda thing
