[2022-12-13 00:58:16] [Announcement] <Nightbot> Huge thanks to Dandyfloss they were playing: Elden Ring, go check them out here: twitch.tv/Dandyfloss
[2022-12-13 00:58:24] <Darkmagic1516> I always liked to torch the ship and watch it burn whenever I was done playing sea of thieves

[2022-12-13 00:58:57] <@%mercykyun> did you just do the tim allen uhhhhhhughgh noise?
[2022-12-13 00:58:59] <orion_the_wise> All noises made by Ari are Ari noises, some are probably random :D

[2022-12-13 00:59:18] <%GarmrUSAF> that.... almost sounded like the sound from Home Improvement
[2022-12-13 00:59:22] <Darkmagic1516> @Dandyfloss no much more fun to watch it slowly burn and catch fully on fire rather then blowing a hole in it and watching it sink
[2022-12-13 00:59:29] <@%mercykyun> yeah that one!

[2022-12-13 01:01:09] <@%Gibster99> I think you sell their flag at reapers too PauseChamp
[2022-12-13 01:01:15] <@%Gibster99> Just saying
[2022-12-13 01:01:42] <Darkmagic1516> PVP is the weakest part of this game KEKW I agree with ari
[2022-12-13 01:02:16] <Darkmagic1516> I mean, I gave a reason as to why I agree with her lol
[2022-12-13 01:02:28] <%+Z4n4duz> @Darkmagic1516 PvPing *can* be good, but it requires a big understanding of what needs to be done and preventing the enemy from reacting
[2022-12-13 01:02:39] VIEWERS: 156
[2022-12-13 01:02:39] <+TheDGsaga> !lurk
[2022-12-13 01:02:40] <@%^Nightbot>* TheDGsaga is a stalker! Arianna kinda likes it though... (‚ÅÑ ‚ÅÑ‚Ä¢‚ÅÑœâ‚ÅÑ‚Ä¢‚ÅÑ ‚ÅÑ)
[2022-12-13 01:02:56] <Darkmagic1516> @Z4n4duz pvp takes so much time and effort to sink someone and for most of the time less loot then a single quest offers lol
[2022-12-13 01:02:57] <%+Z4n4duz> it is kinda gamey though
[2022-12-13 01:03:26] <%+Z4n4duz> @Darkmagic1516 it makes more sense if you fly the PvP emissary flag
[2022-12-13 01:03:35] <%+Z4n4duz> because you can track other emissaries
[2022-12-13 01:03:40] <Darkmagic1516> Like if they had a overall ship HP bar rather then trying to fill the ship it could be better but after like 20 mins I give up and then get chases for a whole hour
[2022-12-13 01:03:43] <%+Z4n4duz> and then strike them when they get full up
[2022-12-13 01:04:06] <%+Z4n4duz> @Darkmagic1516 PvP meta is to send a boarder to keep the enemy from repairing
[2022-12-13 01:04:21] <Darkmagic1516> I'd rather do the other 99% of the game instead of the 1% pvp take sup KEKW
[2022-12-13 01:04:23] <%GarmrUSAF> do the repairs fade over time or something?
[2022-12-13 01:04:33] <@%Gibster99> I think repairs are easier to break
[2022-12-13 01:04:36] <@%Gibster99> Without a proper fix
[2022-12-13 01:04:39] VIEWERS: 156
[2022-12-13 01:04:41] <@%Gibster99> Less HP
[2022-12-13 01:04:44] <Darkmagic1516> @Z4n4duz oh trust me I know, me and a buddy had the brigs deck under water and they still recovered
[2022-12-13 01:04:47] <%+Z4n4duz> @GarmrUSAF not really. the holes persist
[2022-12-13 01:05:00] <Darkmagic1516> @Gibster99 still takes a cannon ball to break it regardless
[2022-12-13 01:05:47] <Darkmagic1516> @GarmrUSAF if you "rent a ship" then the holes despawn when you leave and start of new crew, but if you own a ship they can persist throw games unless you pay gold to remove them
[2022-12-13 01:05:52] <%+Z4n4duz> if you weren't flying a different emissary flag you could pick up their flag and hunt others for their loot and emissary flags
[2022-12-13 01:06:17] <Darkmagic1516> Gonna give your boat a viking burial and burn it? KEKW
[2022-12-13 01:06:29] <%+Z4n4duz> is Ari done for the evening?
