[2022-12-07 12:47:16] <%dpowerdjnr> england need tuanzebe and awb
[2022-12-07 12:47:16] <kierannn_19> lowkey we should play 5
[2022-12-07 12:47:28] <amrshamrani> üôÉüôÉ
[2022-12-07 12:47:34] <%zmlkc> if we play 5 back we lose
[2022-12-07 12:47:34] <AdamRyanFIFA> Yh he won‚Äôt play Sterling for that reason either if he‚Äôs back just negative press
[2022-12-07 12:47:35] <weakendedbus0> mbappe can walk pas maguire not ghonna lie
[2022-12-07 12:47:35] <cjbroster> No chance Rashford over Saka, we‚Äôll need Saka and Walker to have the game of their lives to contain Mbappe
[2022-12-07 12:47:37] <SMACKYOU4NOTHING> @ztommyhx Maybe on the ball. Defensive he is pretty average
[2022-12-07 12:47:40] <%trond1018> If it goes pens we need Sean Dyche to take
[2022-12-07 12:47:40] <%ItsJonesy14> my dream would be rash left foden 10 saka right mane st
[2022-12-07 12:47:45] <%sonyman123> Stokes---> I saw a twitter post of exercise for a girl who says --> go deep
[2022-12-07 12:47:50] <SarcasticHD1111> Man U should cash out on Shaw and Maguire after this tournament
[2022-12-07 12:47:50] <%ItsJonesy14> kane*
[2022-12-07 12:47:50] <%Chabber7> Joan Stonez would be considered a good Spanish CB
[2022-12-07 12:47:56] <kierannn_19> @ItsJonesy14 we can all dream mate
[2022-12-07 12:47:58] <+RedArmyMUFC57> 5 at the back would be horrible
[2022-12-07 12:47:58] <%Deepjhl> Fair point tbf
[2022-12-07 12:48:07] <kierannn_19> we need foden vs france
[2022-12-07 12:48:15] <+RedArmyMUFC57> @sarcastichd1111 Shaw?! Lol
[2022-12-07 12:48:20] <+DavidMurrayy_> I have ptg griez, ill be at the pub cheering both goals
[2022-12-07 12:48:22] <%zTommyHx> @SMACKYOU4NOTHING gotta disagree
[2022-12-07 12:48:23] <deziixixv> rash supersub again
[2022-12-07 12:48:26] <@%+dezperado618> Kane has been playing in weird positions. All of this key plays have come from outside of the box
[2022-12-07 12:48:27] <%sonyman123> Stokes, can i post the twitter link just for the CHAT to enjoy it?
[2022-12-07 12:48:30] <cjbroster> We seem to create more and better chances with Foden on the pitch
[2022-12-07 12:48:30] <%RadmoreB> Got a feeling he will move to a 5 back because he is scared of Mbappe & Co
[2022-12-07 12:48:30] <+Taylor_98> Base yaya or otw Renato next to WC patty V
[2022-12-07 12:48:31] <TLOTOOLE> Hendo has been on it
[2022-12-07 12:48:33] <nobodyjolene> luke shaw goat
[2022-12-07 12:48:34] <%zmlkc> 5 back invites french pressure and time on the ball and thats a danger, if we go at them with same squad we'll beat them
[2022-12-07 12:48:39] <kierannn_19> our midfield should dominate theirs
[2022-12-07 12:48:41] VIEWERS: 949
[2022-12-07 12:48:50] <+RedArmyMUFC57> Shaw one the best LB itw atm
[2022-12-07 12:48:51] <@%+dezperado618> 2 of his assists came from the wing
[2022-12-07 12:48:58] <DM_XI> Rashford offers it
[2022-12-07 12:49:00] <%zmlkc> crazy how much better we are with no mount and yet people love him
[2022-12-07 12:49:02] <SarcasticHD1111> @redarmymufc57 Yes, Shaw lmao. He isn‚Äôt elite
[2022-12-07 12:49:03] <weakendedbus0> rashy can do it
[2022-12-07 12:49:10] <kierannn_19> saka and foden is a to ball pl;ayer
[2022-12-07 12:49:28] <+RedArmyMUFC57> @sarcastichd1111 top player atm bro. Really
[2022-12-07 12:49:35] <%leedevitt> Rashford has to play to stretch it
[2022-12-07 12:49:39] <kierannn_19> saka could be a weapon if he went in behind more
[2022-12-07 12:50:04] <SMACKYOU4NOTHING> @kierannn_19 The key to victory for England is on the midfield indeed. I wouldn‚Äôt start 5 at the back
[2022-12-07 12:50:10] <+RedArmyMUFC57> Bellingham Rice foden saka Rashford would be great
[2022-12-07 12:50:15] <SarcasticHD1111> @redarmymufc57 top player rn, and might not be in 3months. Remember his euros run, and his form after?
[2022-12-07 12:50:17] <%+JustKrepto> great goal
[2022-12-07 12:50:18] <+connor_fergy> mbappe giving gareth nightmares
[2022-12-07 12:50:28] <elcloaksps> Bellingham> Hendo‚Äôs career
[2022-12-07 12:50:36] <kierannn_19> @SMACKYOU4NOTHING yeah the only class midfield playe rfrance have is tch. we need to play through the middle
[2022-12-07 12:50:37] <%„Åæ„ÅÑ„ÅÜ„Åà„ÅÑ (ashoutlaw888)> GlitchCat GlitchCat GlitchCat
[2022-12-07 12:50:39] <+plebalertx> I would like us to play 1 runner and 1 ball player off the flanks but doubt we will
[2022-12-07 12:50:42] VIEWERS: 960
[2022-12-07 12:50:44] <amrshamrani> Which pro you hate to play against???
[2022-12-07 12:50:44] <SarcasticHD1111> And get nuno mendes, a proper elite lb
[2022-12-07 12:50:47] <%+rizeofpower> morning buddy
[2022-12-07 12:50:57] <kierannn_19> rashy
[2022-12-07 12:51:02] <+r0w3y> rash
[2022-12-07 12:51:05] <Producerrrr> Sterling
[2022-12-07 12:51:06] <%Deepjhl> Rashford this tournament
[2022-12-07 12:51:06] <+plebalertx> on current form rashford
[2022-12-07 12:51:06] <SarcasticHD1111> Rash
[2022-12-07 12:51:07] <%RadmoreB> Sterling with Rashford off the bench myself
[2022-12-07 12:51:08] <!%ToeNaiL_szn> Rashford
[2022-12-07 12:51:08] <%+JustKrepto> henderson is the greatest english midfielder to play the game but the agenda against liverpool wont let it stand
[2022-12-07 12:51:09] <dotBR> none LUL
[2022-12-07 12:51:09] <coys600> rashford
[2022-12-07 12:51:14] <kierannn_19> sterling is washed icl
[2022-12-07 12:51:14] <koyirohyuga> Sancho
[2022-12-07 12:51:15] <deziixixv> barnes
[2022-12-07 12:51:16] <+RedArmyMUFC57> @sarcastichd1111 i Know bro but under Ten Hag you have to perform‚Ä¶ Moreover complicated to find a top LB rn
[2022-12-07 12:51:17] <%+rizeofpower> I'm good thanks mate. just about to grind some fifa
[2022-12-07 12:51:25] <gabrielkendrick> sake foden is the best for balance imo defensively they are so good @hashtag_stokes
[2022-12-07 12:51:27] <%+topshelfmari0> Rashy rn
[2022-12-07 12:51:29] <poals2024> i think wings will be saka,rashford cause of legs vs the france wingers
[2022-12-07 12:51:31] <%zmlkc> rashford, hes on fire atm icl
[2022-12-07 12:51:31] <%Deepjhl> @JustKrepto the truth
[2022-12-07 12:51:50] <%+topshelfmari0> What will happen with Sancho sheesh
[2022-12-07 12:51:58] <%zmlkc> hendo lets jude play his game and thats worth letting an aging hendo start in my books
[2022-12-07 12:52:07] <deziixixv> harvey x maddison needed
[2022-12-07 12:52:09] <kierannn_19> as much as i rate foden. i do agree we need saka and rashford vs france
[2022-12-07 12:52:11] <%leedevitt> The midfield battle will be intriguing
[2022-12-07 12:52:27] <%zmlkc> surely only a matter of time until slabhead scores a header surely
[2022-12-07 12:52:29] <chemsquad1> anyone waiting for ufl and didn't buy fifa 23
[2022-12-07 12:52:36] <taggs85> Saka to important for England, works hard offensively and defensively
[2022-12-07 12:52:37] <+plebalertx> id like to see sancho play as a 10 but no chance of that at united
[2022-12-07 12:52:38] <+Taylor_98> Base yaya or otw Renato next to WC patty V
[2022-12-07 12:52:41] <%itsRamzilla> I have a feeling Sancho will end up back at Dortmund.
[2022-12-07 12:52:42] VIEWERS: 960
[2022-12-07 12:52:46] <wisemars7> People are focusing on Mbappe and Walker meanwhile Dembele will smoke Shaw
[2022-12-07 12:52:47] <+RedArmyMUFC57> Maguire header 94th incoming
[2022-12-07 12:52:53] <%+JustKrepto> garnacho needs braces tbf
[2022-12-07 12:52:54] <%sonyman123> Stokes---> allow me to post a link related to Qatar world cup, show it to the chat
[2022-12-07 12:52:56] <nhaych7s1> I thought this was mitchhaywxrd
[2022-12-07 12:52:59] <koyirohyuga> Dortmund sancho > England wingers üòÆ‚Äçüí®
[2022-12-07 12:52:59] <%zmlkc> shaw can lock up dembele
[2022-12-07 12:53:20] <%zmlkc> and realistically if u mark giroud up tight he cant play it into mbappe and dembele
[2022-12-07 12:53:20] <+r0w3y> I've never seen wales play so bad in a tournament lmao. Think the pressure got to us
[2022-12-07 12:53:20] <DM_XI> Way too early to call it on Sancho, he's only had 4-5 months with a proper coach in ETH
[2022-12-07 12:53:26] <%leedevitt> Dembele is top
[2022-12-07 12:53:28] <%zmlkc> and our midfield will control the game
[2022-12-07 12:53:29] <%+ibra_yare20> Sancho is clear of Antony IMO
[2022-12-07 12:53:29] <%+topshelfmari0> Yeah garnacho is wild. The way he was running at teams before the World Cup was very encouraging
[2022-12-07 12:53:44] <%itsRamzilla> this transfer market reset bug is starting to piss me off.
[2022-12-07 12:53:46] <VovATooL> Toure is that good? He looks a bit sloppy
[2022-12-07 12:53:47] <upthewelsh> imo english fans talk to much about all these statements and thoughts but you end up bottling it
[2022-12-07 12:53:48] <+Garbo_games> I think WC cards at this stage are not worth the gamble...Will walker really be worth that much more if he went 5*5*
[2022-12-07 12:53:50] <juajajjajaj> Do you think sanchos tits bounce more than most when he runs?
[2022-12-07 12:53:53] <deziixixv> griezz vs rice rabiot vs hendo
[2022-12-07 12:53:53] <+RedArmyMUFC57> Weak link for France are their RB
[2022-12-07 12:53:56] <%zmlkc> @hashtag_stokes come see me after the game lad and bring your finest written apology with you
[2022-12-07 12:54:09] <@%+dezperado618> shhhhhh dont say Dembele's name too loud. Every time he hears his name he pulls a hammy
[2022-12-07 12:54:13] <itzkdf> Why aren‚Äôt they changing R9‚Äôs face?
[2022-12-07 12:54:19] <+plebalertx> you tried out zambrotta?
[2022-12-07 12:54:20] <+wilmot19> Do you have faith sancho will come good
[2022-12-07 12:54:22] <%sonyman123> CHAT--> who wants to see Qatar wc video related video, get me stokes permission

[2022-12-07 12:54:44] <%zmlkc> @hashtag_stokes for when shaw locks up dembele and we win
[2022-12-07 12:54:45] <%itsRamzilla> I want to try Dani Alves out last night, bought him and he's just some random baldy character in game. Disgrace.
[2022-12-07 12:54:46] <DM_XI> Drogba looks like Maldini still LUL
[2022-12-07 12:55:03] <taggs85> Sancho has been awful, looks like he gained weight as well. Wonder if it‚Äôs the pressure ?
[2022-12-07 12:55:04] <deziixixv> now cr7s left sancho is free
[2022-12-07 12:55:10] <+Taylor_98> I think in a few years sancho could play the Bruno role
[2022-12-07 12:55:26] <+RedArmyMUFC57> Rashford Would destroy Kounde
[2022-12-07 12:55:42] <nhaych7s1> And that‚Äôs the difference between a pro and comp player warra green‚Äôn
[2022-12-07 12:55:44] <dotBR> @itsramzilla its a soccer gamr bro, not some visual drama LUL
[2022-12-07 12:55:53] <+r0w3y> would you reccomend RB ronny over baby cruyff? i have him untradeable but find him very underwhelming. He doesnt work too well with my R9
[2022-12-07 12:56:07] <!%ToeNaiL_szn> Stokes would you let Walker defend mbappe 1on1 or would you double up on him?
[2022-12-07 12:56:12] <jakelfc455778> This guy has outplayed you tbf
[2022-12-07 12:56:16] <+Taylor_98> Base yaya or otw Renato next to WC patty V
[2022-12-07 12:56:17] <DM_XI> More likely to get in behind Theo tbh
[2022-12-07 12:56:18] <%jamzy212> ngl rashford seems reborn
[2022-12-07 12:56:21] <%+ibra_yare20> I don't think Rashforr will start
[2022-12-07 12:56:21] <+flaakkeeyy> thinking england have a chance is just outright embaressing @hashtag_stokes
[2022-12-07 12:56:33] <SarcasticHD1111> Respectfully as a mu fan, Rash ain‚Äôt beating noone 1v1 on the wing
[2022-12-07 12:56:34] <ziginho_> Walker alone will stop Mbappe, @ToeNaiL_szn.
[2022-12-07 12:56:40] <%+topshelfmari0> Midfield is where England can win the tie
[2022-12-07 12:56:42] <@%+dezperado618> kounde looks so fast irl. I cant imagine a faster cb in the top 5 leagues
[2022-12-07 12:56:42] VIEWERS: 1¬†023
[2022-12-07 12:56:45] <+flaakkeeyy> france will run them over 100%
[2022-12-07 12:56:46] <bondehi> ofcourse england has a chance
[2022-12-07 12:56:49] <%JamieSmart> Kdb still best cm?

[2022-12-07 12:56:52] <+Garbo_games> Apart from the USA game nobody has a reason to doubt England so much talent

[2022-12-07 12:56:59] <+flaakkeeyy> hahahaah
[2022-12-07 12:56:59] <rifz_21> @SarcasticHD1111 that's just stupid theo hernandez got torched by dan james for utd
[2022-12-07 12:57:02] <kierannn_19> dominate the midfield we win
[2022-12-07 12:57:03] <%leedevitt> U will never get a better chance with the quality french are missing
[2022-12-07 12:57:08] <%GT_Legit> england are the first real team france is playing
[2022-12-07 12:57:09] <nhaych7s1> If England win the wc then I think that‚Äôs the end of English football
[2022-12-07 12:57:13] <%+ibra_yare20> tbf The odds slightly favor England
[2022-12-07 12:57:17] <nhaych7s1> Nothing will make me shocked no more

[2022-12-07 12:57:46] <%+palachu_04> in my opinion there are 6 World Class Teams left and they all have a chance to win it in a 1 game knockout
[2022-12-07 12:57:50] <+RedArmyMUFC57> @gt_legit same for England
[2022-12-07 12:57:51] <rifz_21> @SarcasticHD1111 I'm saying I don't see how rashford can't beat the french defs 1v1

[2022-12-07 14:42:09] <ogtunes> playing with Ronaldo puts a lot of pressure on the field, you could literally see the dynamic of the game yesterday changed completely after Ronni gets subbed in
