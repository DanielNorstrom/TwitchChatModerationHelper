[2023-01-01 02:06:37] <%drzaius30> anniesHmm Yoshi saying the graphics update will have a large impact
[2023-01-01 02:07:00] <%drzaius30> was expecting minor upgrades anniesHmm
[2023-01-01 02:09:11] <%NoName6834> where did he say that?
[2023-01-01 02:09:51] <%drzaius30> new years letter i posted it on discord
[2023-01-01 02:10:24] <%NoName6834> Essaying
[2023-01-01 02:10:36] <%drzaius30> Essaying indeed
[2023-01-01 02:13:49] <%$Hasan_Lurker> the long post? I can't read YEP
[2023-01-01 02:14:26] <%NoName6834> isn't 16 using an upgraded version or something of the 14 engine? Hmmm
[2023-01-01 02:16:07] <%drzaius30> I'd imagine 16s engine would be a significant upgrade
[2023-01-01 02:18:24] <%drzaius30> likely with 16 development done pretty much those staff will be transferred to work on the graphics update (7.0 as well )
[2023-01-01 02:20:12] <%NoName6834> well 7 month till fanfest and we find out more
[2023-01-01 02:20:17] <%JurgenRapp> seeing Annie like that actually made me miss coming home to a tipsy gf  FeelsOkayMan
[2023-01-01 02:21:03] <%drzaius30> actually graphics update stuff is meant to start in the patch cycle
[2023-01-01 02:21:20] <%drzaius30> backend stuff started in 6.2 YEP
[2023-01-01 02:21:40] <%NoName6834> she didn't seem too drunk LUL
[2023-01-01 02:21:53] <%drzaius30> Ye just a little tipsy

[2023-01-01 02:29:14] <%JurgenRapp> in ff
[2023-01-01 02:29:15] <%drzaius30> though it might show up in a future moogle event in a year or 2
[2023-01-01 02:29:26] <%drzaius30> @JurgenRapp ye
[2023-01-01 02:29:45] <%drzaius30> it requires a bit more effort
[2023-01-01 02:30:02] <%drzaius30> 50 tomes would take about 2 hours
[2023-01-01 02:30:15] <%drzaius30> shorter with blu mages
[2023-01-01 02:30:44] <%NoName6834> I still need to do that plus decide if I care about the pvp series stuff
[2023-01-01 02:31:23] <%drzaius30> the pvp stuff can be done if you throw an hour and a bit at it each day
[2023-01-01 02:31:34] <%drzaius30> you don't need to win
[2023-01-01 02:32:22] <%drzaius30> about 8 hours needed roughly 10 tops
[2023-01-01 02:33:25] <%drzaius30> I was attempting crystal rank so i got rank 30 5 more then needed a day after patch xdd
[2023-01-01 02:33:51] <%drzaius30> Played about 500 pvp games in 3 weeks

[2023-01-01 03:20:24] <%drzaius30> the best thing they can do is not remind me about work KEKW
[2023-01-01 03:20:27] <%Wardrick7> at least they try LUL
[2023-01-01 03:21:20] <%Wardrick7> im on call duty this week so im happy they didnt remind he about work LUL
[2023-01-01 03:22:22] <%Wardrick7> but its very strange to get greetings from work, they should know that silence is the best greeting LUL
[2023-01-01 03:22:56] <%drzaius30> they been very spammy i think its the new secretary LUL
[2023-01-01 03:24:47] <%drzaius30> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_jZ4yI_hD0 really tempted to replay Forbidden west
[2023-01-01 03:24:56] <%drzaius30> so pretty
[2023-01-01 03:29:27] <%Wardrick7> it looks great, i enjoyed the first game but at same time i took a break from it for few months so i am afraid it will feel the same
[2023-01-01 03:29:54] <%Wardrick7> it just feels like it doesnt have something to hook me up like other games
[2023-01-01 03:30:31] <%drzaius30> I really enjoyed the combat and story
[2023-01-01 03:31:26] <%Wardrick7> combat is great, main story is also fun, but for me side quests were too repetitive and i like to play games to 100% completion
[2023-01-01 03:31:53] <%drzaius30> the only combat issue with 2 is the machines need cooldowns for spammy ability's
[2023-01-01 03:32:06] <%drzaius30> some machines anniesHeadache
[2023-01-01 03:32:38] <%Wardrick7> you mean when you mind control them?
[2023-01-01 03:33:02] <%drzaius30> no when they are trying to kill you LUL
[2023-01-01 03:33:08] <%Wardrick7> oh LUL
[2023-01-01 03:33:35] <%drzaius30> they really don't let you breath LUL
[2023-01-01 03:34:20] <%Wardrick7> that does sound annoying LUL
[2023-01-01 03:35:33] <%drzaius30> i haven't played it since it came out so might have been patched
[2023-01-01 03:35:47] <%drzaius30> it was a common complaint
[2023-01-01 03:37:37] <%Wardrick7> i saw you took a pic with one of the exiles ConcernFroge
[2023-01-01 03:37:53] <%drzaius30> Hayami KEKW
[2023-01-01 03:38:13] <%Wardrick7> you should force him to come back YEP
[2023-01-01 03:38:51] <%drzaius30> He is doing it for raiding purposes LUL
[2023-01-01 03:39:32] <%Wardrick7> it doesnt matter we need more members Madge
[2023-01-01 03:40:24] <%Wardrick7> imagine if Annie comes back COPIUM and we dont have enough members to great her in endwalker PepeHands
[2023-01-01 03:41:07] <%drzaius30> tbf the reason we don't have members is cause we don't recruit at all LUL
[2023-01-01 03:41:49] <%drzaius30> Fresh blood really depends on Active streamer YEP
[2023-01-01 03:42:26] <%Wardrick7> our recruitment strategy is Annie playing so we kinda out of options for some time LUL
[2023-01-01 03:42:40] <%drzaius30> Lazy recruitment YEP
[2023-01-01 03:43:09] <%Wardrick7> i remember when we tried to make a static, good times YEP
[2023-01-01 03:44:07] <%drzaius30> would be a different beast if Annie was playing patch content
[2023-01-01 03:44:31] <%Wardrick7> YEP but i doubt that will happen any time soon LUL
[2023-01-01 03:44:52] <%drzaius30> unfortunate what happened during shadowbringers anniesSole
[2023-01-01 03:45:58] <%Wardrick7> our only hope was content drought in wow but right now it seems it wont be long enough anytime soon
[2023-01-01 03:46:34] <%drzaius30> Annies going to be swamped this year regardless
[2023-01-01 03:46:45] <%Wardrick7> YEP
[2023-01-01 03:46:56] <%Wardrick7> too many things happening
[2023-01-01 03:46:57] <%drzaius30> crazy year for single player games
[2023-01-01 03:47:08] <%drzaius30> throw in events
[2023-01-01 03:47:18] <%Wardrick7> just impossible to play all the games
[2023-01-01 03:47:43] <%drzaius30> Least Annie will get a chance for a fanfest in october
[2023-01-01 03:48:15] <%drzaius30> best one 2 cause its when you get to see teaser for 7.0 PauseChamp
[2023-01-01 03:48:46] <%Wardrick7> god of war, spider man, dying light, Mario + Rabbids COPIUM
[2023-01-01 03:49:00] <%drzaius30> And Yoshi will dress up in whatever new job there is
[2023-01-01 03:49:18] <%Wardrick7> i wonder if she will be invited this time for interviews
[2023-01-01 03:49:37] <%drzaius30> she has a passive sponsorship
[2023-01-01 03:49:54] <%Wardrick7> she does but you never know with companies
[2023-01-01 03:50:27] <%drzaius30> it really comes down to whoever organises its competence
[2023-01-01 03:50:38] <%Wardrick7> YEP
[2023-01-01 03:51:06] <%Wardrick7> it would be awesome if she gets invited
[2023-01-01 03:51:21] <%drzaius30> Hope preach gets one
[2023-01-01 03:51:52] <%Wardrick7> i think he will this time
[2023-01-01 03:52:06] <%Wardrick7> he was kinda late last time
[2023-01-01 03:52:16] <%drzaius30> Preach actually wants to attend the Vegas fanfest even earlier
[2023-01-01 03:53:18] <%Wardrick7> he also tried to get YoshiP interview for some time now
[2023-01-01 03:53:26] <%drzaius30> But a london will be better for preach and Annie much closer
[2023-01-01 03:53:56] <%Wardrick7> there will be a fanfest in London?
[2023-01-01 03:53:58] <%drzaius30> @Wardrick7 the dude is super busy

[2023-01-01 14:33:50] <%Taylor131313> at least league has some proper action in it
[2023-01-01 14:33:54] <$Thunderbrew> Which ranged class is good in PVP?
[2023-01-01 14:33:54] <Anelit21> TFT is only for pro mathematicians
[2023-01-01 14:33:55] <%krazybair> TFT involves wayyyyyyyyyyyy too much RNG
[2023-01-01 14:33:59] <Anelit21> so many math 5Head
[2023-01-01 14:34:03] <%Mirkooo> WAYTOODANK
[2023-01-01 14:34:03] <%Bitfrost9> TFT is confusing at first. it takes some practice to get used to it. And then they change everything again.
[2023-01-01 14:34:08] <%Collnaris> who is the rogue?

[2023-01-01 14:34:25] <%Mirkooo> I couldnt even imagine playing TFT without a mobalytics overlay KEKW
[2023-01-01 14:34:27] <%Collnaris> or monk
[2023-01-01 14:34:44] <%itsClubby> its also a brilliant chast interaction game because of teh downtime
[2023-01-01 14:34:48] <%itsClubby> typing is hard
[2023-01-01 14:35:14] <Basilwheat> TFT has base knowledge which you will still have to learn , but they change set every 6 months or so , so you just have to re-learn the set not the whole game
[2023-01-01 14:35:20] <%Taylor131313> it's funny because I can watch Chrissy play league and valorant, but when she plays TFT I tune out instantly, can't stand it KEKW
[2023-01-01 14:35:35] <%Bitfrost9> i was so into TFT in season 3. got to diamond. i didnt have to rely on guides or overlays. i was genuinely having fun. then season 4 came and i hated the feeling of having to relearn everything.

[2023-01-01 15:19:45] <%Taylor131313> meow
[2023-01-01 15:19:47] <xJaysus_> they should implement obligatory torghast runs as a punishment for leavers

[2023-01-01 15:20:09] <%$loppish91> i swear they should have like 1 hour leave penalty and lose alot of rating
[2023-01-01 15:20:19] <%Mirkooo> That's what im wondering
[2023-01-01 15:20:22] <%Morgonbladet> You lose CR
[2023-01-01 15:20:24] <MrWholesomeLad> They lose mmr
[2023-01-01 15:20:26] <%krazybair> @Mirkooo what does annie get?
[2023-01-01 15:20:31] <%Morgonbladet> but next game they gain all CR again if play better
[2023-01-01 15:20:31] <%Geoffku> WutFace so bright
[2023-01-01 15:20:32] <$MisterTea86> What is CR, by the way?
[2023-01-01 15:20:35] <%Mirkooo> @krazybair Nothing i think
[2023-01-01 15:20:42] <MetaShock_> mmr vs cr? whats the difference
[2023-01-01 15:20:42] <Ohq__> Should lose a good chunk of MMR
[2023-01-01 15:20:52] <%Taylor131313> they should lose 200 rating and MMR YEP
[2023-01-01 15:20:56] <$MisterTea86> Ah, so your Solo CR is 1364
[2023-01-01 15:20:58] <%aut_seelwarr> hey toogeher^^
[2023-01-01 15:21:01] <Rid0> i was the shaman healer
[2023-01-01 15:21:01] <%krazybair> What are these boxes on top of the other players?
[2023-01-01 15:21:03] <%indiehjaerta> so guys whos stream sniping
[2023-01-01 15:21:05] <+MintLocust> if they lose mmr, then they will lose on purpose to smurf
[2023-01-01 15:21:06] <%Morgonbladet> They are going to add that, also everyone else will gain/lose if someone leaves
[2023-01-01 15:21:15] <xJaysus_> the concept of mmr is that it kind of retains its value between seasons
[2023-01-01 15:21:17] <%Collnaris> the current system isn't that punishing
[2023-01-01 15:21:31] <$MisterTea86> I'm a bit more familiar with MMR. Do they show that in-game? Or does that require addons?
[2023-01-01 15:21:53] <LemonMaster> well that's rogue and ww. they randomly delete you
[2023-01-01 15:21:54] <Ohq__> Healers hard abuse leaving since they have insta queues so it doesnt matter

[2023-01-01 15:23:30] <LemonMaster> I don't understand the logic behind everyone else get/lose 0 if someone leaves. wont it make more sense to just change their cr based on the matched played untill then?
[2023-01-01 15:24:00] VIEWERS: 1 506
[2023-01-01 15:24:25] <%Collnaris> @LemonMaster exactly what they should do and give more penalties on leavers
[2023-01-01 15:24:52] <%Rolaz> 50k omg
[2023-01-01 15:24:53] <%Taylor131313> 50k sac ticks OMEGALUL
[2023-01-01 15:25:02] <%CipansR> rough
[2023-01-01 15:25:09] <xJaysus_> my suggestion is obligatory torghast runs for leavers
[2023-01-01 15:25:10] <%krazybair> @AnnieFuchsia in the world, u have little colored boxes above every player. what are they
[2023-01-01 15:25:10] <%Taylor131313> are you even supposed to take that much sac damage?
[2023-01-01 15:25:30] <LemonMaster> @xJaysus_ thats a good one :D

[2023-01-01 15:26:52] <%Mirkooo> @Collnaris Do you get priority queue then atleast after someone leaves? Like in Overwatch? anniesHmm

[2023-01-01 17:49:54] <pwn7n7> inervate helps
[2023-01-01 17:49:55] <%bYTEfROG> does she use innervate?
[2023-01-01 17:49:57] <%Morgonbladet> solo shuffles are short and you can press innervate
[2023-01-01 17:50:14] <%Morgonbladet> look for clear cast and use it with regrowth
[2023-01-01 17:50:17] <pwn7n7> plus using things like flourish when you low on mana makes you use less mana

[2023-01-01 21:55:12] <%Taylor131313> we should start reserving tier pieces for regulars to finish their sets tbh

[2023-01-01 21:57:01] <Fanzer> I still have no pieces, still pushing 19 keys. Sure it's a huge bonus but it's still down to player performance in the end

[2023-01-01 22:26:31] <%Hezmund> @nastye if thats the case they should be implementing those features into the game
[2023-01-01 22:26:47] <%Boreall> I mean we've been using DBM/BW for over 15 years, sure, they SHOULD implement in game, but that's not the game we're playing
[2023-01-01 22:27:29] <%Hezmund> it's like saying "oh we designed this car to work with this feature from a third party supplier, but we don't provide it ourselves

[2023-01-01 22:27:39] <%Collnaris> thi is rough
[2023-01-01 22:27:39] <+Vanamman> @Boreall Also to be fair. They do have pretty good ways to show the mechanics, but DBM and such go the extra mile and provide timers and more elaborate sounds for warnings

[2023-01-01 22:27:51] <+Athropos1> And its not even tyrannical week
[2023-01-01 22:27:54] <+Athropos1> ouch
[2023-01-01 22:27:57] <%nastye> both DBM and BW are so mature at this point, anything blizzard makes will be a HUGE time sink in terms of development time and 99% will just keep using the addons they have been using for the past 15 years

[2023-01-01 22:31:09] <LifeisPepeHands> Yes, to his feet

[2023-01-01 22:31:19] <%Regnory> @LifeisPepeHands Depends what the groups idea of the keystone is :) Some just do high + weekly keys for vaults
[2023-01-01 22:31:20] <%nastye> @LifeisPepeHands if youre already 30 mins above timer you might as well do pull timers peepoOkay
[2023-01-01 22:31:23] <%Mirkooo> peepoFeet ?
[2023-01-01 22:31:29] <%Regnory> Those doesn't care about time, they just want it completed

[2023-01-01 22:31:37] <%AnanasACE> @LifeisPepeHands but they are already over time, so they can have controlled pulls with a timer without bricking the key

[2023-01-01 22:33:02] <Gillatta> its one of the better ones for warlock tho
[2023-01-01 22:33:23] <Gillatta> the trinket
[2023-01-01 22:33:36] <%PneumaWHU> valor is capped, so you might not want to upgrade somthing like that
[2023-01-01 22:33:37] <%Collnaris> horn of valor is what you want

[2023-01-01 22:36:31] <%Collnaris> and /pull is easier to type
[2023-01-01 22:36:56] <zalonas> maybe it's so that there isn't a conflicting issue if ppl have the addon loaded
[2023-01-01 22:36:58] <%BrendanK> my mark was cleared when you thought I was running away btw Annie, if someone dies with mark you have to clear on their body
[2023-01-01 22:36:59] <%Ammbrus> wait i'm late does /pull not work without addons?
[2023-01-01 22:37:01] <%nastye> i for one hate /countdown because i only play with master channel audio so i hear addons only and countdown plays on something else
[2023-01-01 22:37:02] <+Vanamman> I wonder if that might have caused 2 timers then. I agree they shouldn't technically design around addons but it's been such a staple
[2023-01-01 22:37:09] <LifeisPepeHands> I didn't use addons when I was younger during TBC or WOTLK because I could remember every  mechanic but now... xqcOld
[2023-01-01 22:37:12] <%Aegis_2566> What Nastye said
[2023-01-01 22:37:15] <%drzaius30> make it /go even faster WICKED

[2023-01-01 22:37:23] <%Regnory> DBM / BigWigs will just redesign their pull? HUH
[2023-01-01 22:37:23] <%Hezmund> addon might override the built in countdown
[2023-01-01 22:37:32] <%Collnaris> they should make it /pullThisGroupOfMobs
[2023-01-01 22:37:34] <%Ammbrus> sounds like a you problem xdd
[2023-01-01 22:37:37] <%Aegis_2566> He doesnt hear /countdown

[2023-01-01 22:37:41] <%Regnory> ¨@hez
[2023-01-01 22:37:44] <%Hezmund> so someone who has the addon does /pull and addon takes over, so people with in game still don't see it

[2023-01-01 22:38:27] <%Hezmund> they could
[2023-01-01 22:38:31] <Goowreck> The addon developer can always change something, it shouldn't be avoided being put in base game because "ohh it may affect an addon"
[2023-01-01 22:38:32] <Honeycrispie> That's far too much effort, a few minutes changing code? D:
[2023-01-01 22:38:35] <%Wardrick7> but they want to override what is in game
[2023-01-01 22:38:36] <%phreak43> you can also do /cd instead of typing out countdown
[2023-01-01 22:38:37] <%Regnory> They could and 100% would
[2023-01-01 22:38:38] <%Mirkooo> This seems like such an easy solution LULW

[2023-01-01 22:38:50] <%Collnaris> yes but what about Bobby Kotick?
[2023-01-01 22:38:50] <blaise_pmk> Hey, did you end up killing Dathea hc?
[2023-01-01 22:38:51] <%AnanasACE> no the point of addons is the creator wants you to use their addon and not basic stuff Kappa
[2023-01-01 22:38:53] <+Vanamman> They could and they certainlywould if blizzard changing it caused an issue
[2023-01-01 22:39:04] <%BrendanK> my mark was cleared when you thought I was running away btw Annie, Morgon died with other negative & someone dies with mark you have to clear on their body
[2023-01-01 22:39:13] <what_kappa> whats the 7day buff u got?
[2023-01-01 22:39:14] <%Turbopumper> imagine if you never had to update addons Pog
[2023-01-01 22:39:31] <SilverSpik> are people pretending to be programmers? you think we dont have the "technology " for /pull to work for both ingame and dbm lol

[2023-01-01 22:40:33] <FluffyDooom> Addons should bend and adapt to the game, not the other way around :P
[2023-01-01 22:40:42] <%nastye> @SilverSpik no were saying people without addons went from "no timer" to "/countdown" which means a net gain for them without disturbing the established solution
[2023-01-01 22:40:49] <Dracule_X> lol
[2023-01-01 22:40:59] <%Boreall> @SilverSpik I'm also wondering what people used before /countdown was added in

[2023-01-01 22:41:08] <%phreak43> @AnnieFuchsia you can use /cd instead of typing out countdown

[2023-01-01 22:42:05] <%AnanasACE> @Aegis_2566 because Annie wants the default one to be used so people without dbm also see the countdown
[2023-01-01 22:42:05] <lwiggell> I have some add-ons very recent because Guild wants me to use them on raids
[2023-01-01 22:42:19] <%BrendanK> just mentioning in case you have people die with mark Annie as you have to clear on dead person
[2023-01-01 22:42:27] <%nastye> fwiw, imagine blizzard was "dumb", they didnt know about /pull and thought they added a totally cool new feature to the game. they made the choice at some point down the line and thats what they decided on
[2023-01-01 22:42:37] <%Taylor131313> wait, you need to clear on dead person if a marked person die?
[2023-01-01 22:42:41] <+thenoisebringer> How do you like Destruction? I've been playing demo and I like it.
[2023-01-01 22:42:42] <Dracule_X> well /cd is even better then /pull so you got a better solution than what you wanted

[2023-01-01 22:42:44] <+Vanamman> @AnanasACE Which imo is the correct way to do it. Shouldn't force those addons on people

[2023-01-01 22:48:47] <+Vanamman> @NPCChris I actively try to use fewer addons. I still keep them around, but I've removed ElvUI and stuff like that completely
[2023-01-01 22:48:48] <%Collnaris> you dont need as many addons for pvp
[2023-01-01 22:48:49] <+thenoisebringer> yeah I PvP and I barely use any addons

[2023-01-01 22:48:56] <+SolaniumG> forsure
[2023-01-01 22:49:00] <%Taylor131313> is pvp significantly harder without gladius/DR timers etc?
[2023-01-01 22:49:04] <%Collnaris> i have very few addons for pvp
[2023-01-01 22:49:05] <%Aegis_2566> Pvp is not as scripted as pve is
[2023-01-01 22:49:07] <%Morgonbladet> btw what addon do you use to see all hots on raidframes?
[2023-01-01 22:49:07] <%Turbopumper> I only use DBM and weakauras for pve YEP
[2023-01-01 22:49:11] <%Bitfrost9> PvE is more scripted so there is more room for addons to help.
[2023-01-01 22:49:15] <%Wardrick7> in pve WA can be enough
[2023-01-01 22:49:23] <c0mmander_starscream> I dont raid alot thats why i dont use them
[2023-01-01 22:49:25] <+Vanamman> @sthhawkeye It's probably still Demo, but it's not insanely far ahead of Destro and that's still only at the highest levels
[2023-01-01 22:49:30] <%Aegis_2566> In pvp the other player is your enemy, they can decide to pop cds now, or in 10 seconds. They can stun you or your healer
[2023-01-01 22:49:44] <%Turbopumper> if I was tanking or healing then I'd prolly use cooldown trackers as well
[2023-01-01 22:49:47] <freezeyaa> I'm that typical... "Gieeeeeeef addons" type of guy.. But since DF and UI updates, it doesn't feel necessary any more :P

[2023-01-01 22:50:29] <+thenoisebringer> yup, my favorite addons are the ones that just do one thing,but do it well.
[2023-01-01 22:50:41] <%Collnaris> im glad i was able to get rid of Bartender, so the more they make addons obsolete, i will be happier nymnOkay
[2023-01-01 22:50:44] <%Bitfrost9> yeah that's my experience with elvui. i love it, but a lot of stuff i doon't use in it
[2023-01-01 22:50:51] <%Taylor131313> that is very true though, there's very little good 'specialized' addons, addons tend to want to do too much
[2023-01-01 22:50:57] <%Regnory> @Bitfrost9 <--- TRUE
[2023-01-01 22:51:07] <%themcfresh> just use elvui EZ

[2023-01-01 22:51:16] <freezeyaa> Yeah i mean, it should be a whatever floats your boats situation. Which it is, but alot of folks kinda wanna force it on peeps
[2023-01-01 22:51:23] <%Taylor131313> I still wouldn't remove it since your bind randomly stop working at least twice per stream KEKW never happened to me

[2023-01-01 22:51:45] <%Twigbot4k> elvui, does not change the entire game, note, it entirely changes the game's UI.  :)
[2023-01-01 22:51:47] <Daddyknut> elvui is some sci fi shit
[2023-01-01 22:51:48] <%themcfresh> bc it's all-encompassing
[2023-01-01 22:51:58] <+NPCChris> For healing I use clique as a healing add-on, and use ElvUI for all my general UI.
[2023-01-01 22:52:00] <%AnanasACE> if it takes blizzard 2 patches to let us move the exp bar, then maybe changing /cd to /pull isn't as easy as we think
[2023-01-01 22:52:01] <+Vanamman> I tend to track tank CDs as a healer, also use Vuhdo for frames as it allows Click healing and allows me to add specific raid abilities I want to dispel).
[2023-01-01 22:52:06] <%Collnaris> it doesn't feel like wow anymore

[2023-01-01 22:52:16] <%Mirkooo> I recently switched from Elvui raid frames to Blizzard raid frames and it's so much better EZ
[2023-01-01 22:52:25] <%+snagprophet> is world quest tracker even worth it any more when we have less world quests in current expansion?
[2023-01-01 22:52:26] <%Twigbot4k> Fun fact, Weak aura addon is so fancy awesome, you can replace your entire wow UI with.. just weak auras.  O.o
[2023-01-01 22:52:27] <FluffyDooom> The only reason I started using DBM back in OG wrath, was because OTHER guildies was struggeling with seeing when I got mechanics on me, so they wanted the alerts in chat bubbles :P

[2023-01-01 22:55:26] <+NPCChris> Here's a discussion topic: Keybinds! Just this past week I starting transitioning to no longer using 1,2,3,4,5., etc. for my basic abilities.
[2023-01-01 22:55:31] <%themcfresh> they just assume if you move one you're moving them both to where you want
[2023-01-01 22:55:32] <%casualzgamer> or get sexymap addon to put it below anniesOpie
[2023-01-01 22:55:40] <%AnanasACE> but don't the quests disappear when you pull a boss?
[2023-01-01 22:55:42] <%Regnory> BASED idea
[2023-01-01 22:55:46] <Felsmoke> YEP Edit mode needs a lot of fixes

[2023-01-01 22:56:34] <+Blinkfl> For me I had to installed a unit frame just because I don't like to play as a hunter and have the pet unit frame so small and blizzard don't allow us to resize the pet frame alone
[2023-01-01 22:56:35] <@%^Annies_Bot>* The sub-train has ended at 2!

[2023-01-01 23:15:36] <Anelit21> All dungeons seem interesting, the only thing i dont like is that shadowmoon seems like a "too free" key.

[2023-01-01 23:16:56] <+Vanamman> @Collnaris This boss specifically is awful as a healer lol
[2023-01-01 23:16:57] <%Geoffku> shadowmoon is the best dungeon
[2023-01-01 23:17:01] <+Vanamman> such a heal check

[2023-01-01 23:55:18] <%RavenNerd> trinket
[2023-01-01 23:55:19] <Anelit21> you can choose what stats will staff have
[2023-01-01 23:55:21] <madein90ss> u can get 93 sparks total
[2023-01-01 23:55:23] <%Turbopumper> weapons cost so much to upgrade, especially 2h
[2023-01-01 23:55:23] <Eberhard1991> staff feels more passive damage buff, trinkets only one use/procc
[2023-01-01 23:55:25] <%Collnaris> my expert opinion is you need to focus your bracers Kappa
[2023-01-01 23:55:26] <madein90ss> *3
[2023-01-01 23:55:26] <FENIXHAZE10> craft should be dagger + lariat
[2023-01-01 23:55:31] <SilverSpik> crafted dagger only need 1 spark'
[2023-01-01 23:55:31] <%Wardrick7> where is your other spark? you should have 3 now
[2023-01-01 23:55:32] <%Aegis_2566> To get 418 crafted staff you need to do 10x 17s to get the concentrated focus
[2023-01-01 23:55:35] <sthhawkeye> staff cause trinkets are always cheaper and easier to get ..
[2023-01-01 23:55:35] <%Makkan780> you should have 3 sparks now
[2023-01-01 23:55:37] <Anelit21> Lariat is trap
[2023-01-01 23:55:38] <%Aegis_2566> 16 drops the normal focus
[2023-01-01 23:55:39] <kronendk> would say upgrade trinket
[2023-01-01 23:55:54] <%Mirkooo> 16 drops concentrated focus @Aegis_2566

[2023-01-01 23:56:15] <%PneumaWHU> sbg drops bis off hand, could go with crafted dagger
[2023-01-01 23:56:16] <madein90ss> lariat is BiS but in comparions its such a low upgrade from basic necks
[2023-01-01 23:56:19] <%Aegis_2566> Sorry I dont do those key levels anymore Mirko
[2023-01-01 23:56:19] <+Darkmedic69> yes
