It illuminates his, pale almost ghostly face, he is sweating yet he feels so cold. From his lips only one word is whispered "Grandpa" he shivers for this word is a mortal reminder of his haunting nightmare. He tries to calm himself reassuring it was all but a bad dream. He looks up, a surrender vote blinking in the dark, and in the background Kurt's maniacal laugh. Û†ÄÄ

[2022-12-30 13:05:01] <%+Skovzy> what would u say if that was at a lan event?

[2022-12-30 13:05:14] <blouis13> He just wanted to win
[2022-12-30 13:05:20] <MattyyCakes> is it less ratty if its possession in and around the edge of the area rather than your own half
[2022-12-30 13:05:22] <Ziyyaada05> who did you lose to?
[2022-12-30 13:05:27] <baldsmackhead69> But why do freaks play this ball holding possession cringe style it‚Äôs no skill any1 can do it
[2022-12-30 13:05:29] <%+Skovzy> must be so frustratin at lan
[2022-12-30 13:05:30] <%appiie3> on Poals you cant play like that, its too barbarik
[2022-12-30 13:05:37] <nipe1904> Are FGS the entire thing or is it qualifier for a lan event?
[2022-12-30 13:05:40] <StarClown98> What tactics and instruction is stokes running?
[2022-12-30 13:05:41] <SarcasticHD1111> @mattyycakes those people are the worst
[2022-12-30 13:05:46] <+VapourX20> Pro games are also alot longer
[2022-12-30 13:05:48] <%+JustKrepto> @hashtag_stokes heard jack sharpp is doing a meet and great in waitrose and marks and spencers, you attending?
[2022-12-30 13:05:55] <god_revenger> @baldsmackhead69 its very expected people sweating after 15-0
[2022-12-30 13:06:00] <%+th3antman> I dunno what's happened to my ps5 interface. when I'm in a game of fifa. I used to be able to press the ps button and it would pop up and say FUT, whatever game I was playing be it rivals or champs it'd say 2-2 and give me my opponents psn name but now that's disappeared. any idea what I've accidentally changed?
[2022-12-30 13:06:14] <+Cedsam_88> that's the rhing
[2022-12-30 13:06:14] <%Njckoh> do u think i can play mid gullit ST would he be good
[2022-12-30 13:06:14] <king_henrik67> You have to be ‚Äògood‚Äô to play like that. I wouldn‚Äôt have the ability to do what he did
[2022-12-30 13:06:16] <StavAttack> excuse me you guys are 11 or 15 years old or you never competed in a lan event. Everyone plays like this and you have to do whatevere it takes and when i say whatever i really mean whatever in order to win
[2022-12-30 13:06:16] <daada_sk> who did you lose to?
[2022-12-30 13:06:17] <!%+getriggedkid__> people dont understand comp fifa and wl is literally a different game
[2022-12-30 13:06:21] <rifz_21> it's proper draining to play those possession hoarders
[2022-12-30 13:06:24] <cherann046> cr7 rb like that?
[2022-12-30 13:06:26] <!%+getriggedkid__> heard u lost to tekkz

[2022-12-30 13:06:48] <king_henrik67> Yeah was just saying.    Horrible style
[2022-12-30 13:06:56] <SarcasticHD1111> People that one-two pass for a long time outside your box and then r1, are the worst people to play against
[2022-12-30 13:06:57] <marcocfc28> Random question, But do pros change there tactocs a little to share them, So no one uses there tactics against them?
[2022-12-30 13:07:07] <ViciouzMoey> if i save my pp for 6pm will i be able to get the new players from team2?
[2022-12-30 13:07:11] <+c4llmeSay> guys the guy was good he was just a tryhard

[2022-12-30 13:08:01] <+Covidmaster00> @cj_nsza It‚Äôs important to them because they are not pay to wins so they need those coins
[2022-12-30 13:08:03] <+dewwalle> Yeoooo
[2022-12-30 13:08:04] <%+Skovzy> i think the game shoudl glitch if you keep the ball for more than 30 seconds
[2022-12-30 13:08:06] <%Lambchop2x> Except constant press lol that shit breaks the game
[2022-12-30 13:08:07] <+dre_the_man> havent changed tactics in weeks, its almost irrelevant

[2022-12-30 13:08:15] <+xVensure> unless it's 5 back drop back 1 depth you can't do anything
[2022-12-30 13:08:16] <MattyyCakes> yeah the tactics are meant to feed into what the players good at, theyre not the end-all be-all
[2022-12-30 13:08:20] <+Lueytg> Would you go for marksman on ww sancho to make him controlled, or hunte for explosive stokes?
[2022-12-30 13:08:23] <%+topshelfmari0> Yea I never won a game due to tactics
[2022-12-30 13:08:23] <king_henrik67> Do you think tactics have a bigger impact for average players?
[2022-12-30 13:08:23] <!%kiyan544> is umut still amazing this fifa?

[2022-12-30 13:24:58] <!%joshibet06> @jdelaneyy it requires skill there is a reason why benecr7 and Nicolas are so good with them

[2022-12-30 13:56:16] <SkeenSick> do you think Trent stays at Liverpool his whole career?
[2022-12-30 13:56:16] <+Enu_Macchie> hakimi has ben suspect
[2022-12-30 13:56:16] <coatseylfc> @xxreddevil16xx van dijk plays on the left pal

[2022-12-30 13:56:26] <DM_XI> if Hakimi was at City you'd all say he's the best itw
[2022-12-30 13:56:27] <rayedkandil> Hakimi is better than Trent
[2022-12-30 13:56:27] <JDelaneyy> Trent being generational is so funny hahahahahha
[2022-12-30 13:56:28] <+Duran177> 1. Reece 2. Hakimi 3. Trent
[2022-12-30 13:56:28] <%+domyyb7> Hakimi without his pace isn't that good let's be honest

[2022-12-30 13:56:33] <%RXRashed> Carvajal is better than Trent
[2022-12-30 13:56:35] <Rizqh> Because he's not English he's over hyped. If hakimi was English he's be a poor man's Layton bains
[2022-12-30 13:56:35] <%FALSE9lNE> hakimi is a lackluster defender

[2022-12-30 13:57:25] <nestanderrr> Dalot is better than trent hakimi James
[2022-12-30 13:57:32] <%sparkrzz> Love how chats gagging on james when the only thing he brings to chelsea is the injury prone trait. Hes been out like 6 months now hes out again hahahhahah
[2022-12-30 13:57:32] <%+bainer2788> Hakimi is a poor man‚Äôs James

[2022-12-30 13:57:58] <JxPell> If i already have a decent team is it worth spending 5 mil on 94 r9? (he would be replacing rulebreakers r7) or spread coins out on 3 players.
[2022-12-30 13:57:58] <rayedkandil> Offensively Hakimi is better

[2022-12-30 15:24:18] <dagmargomes21> nkunku cf kai st
[2022-12-30 15:24:19] <chewablealarm> Not many top strikers now. We just left an era of the last 11-12 that had like 10 incredible world class strikers and about 10 pretty good strikers below all those guys are retired, nearing retirement or unavailable. You gotta try and work with what you can buy these days until more strikers come
[2022-12-30 15:24:21] <dyar2513> we wouldn't hear of nkunku in 2 years because of chelshit
[2022-12-30 15:24:22] <!sina_mb> Taremi would be a good option mate, score 18 this season so far
[2022-12-30 15:24:26] <youness_37> They're selliny Havertz Ziyech and Pulisic
[2022-12-30 15:24:26] <+LazyFatKoala> Nkunku is the same type of player Havertz was
[2022-12-30 15:24:27] <udai444> Why are ppl signing for Chelsea tbh
[2022-12-30 15:24:28] <dagmargomes21> nkunku can play out wide too
[2022-12-30 15:24:39] <%+DaveTheRed> Osimhen is an elite striker, but nobody wants to negociate with Laurentiis
[2022-12-30 15:24:42] <+xVensure> @marnzzz If money wasn't a problem we'd need leao more and probably could justify it to the glazers rather than a winger we don't need
[2022-12-30 15:24:45] <%+Thegainztrain> can't lie I'd take havertz
[2022-12-30 15:24:55] <jabs_dell> @sina_mb hes 30 and woould cost more than 40 mil
[2022-12-30 15:24:58] <@%+georgesquirrell> I rate Havertz
[2022-12-30 15:25:04] <%+Thegainztrain> Good player in there for sure
[2022-12-30 15:25:05] <+bailey_mck01> Havertz is a fraud
