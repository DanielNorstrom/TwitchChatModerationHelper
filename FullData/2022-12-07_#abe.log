[2022-12-07 06:17:10] <%epicawishes> it's like a similar concept to ice cream float which is soda and ice cream

[2022-12-07 06:25:40] <%puppyman25_> You could do vertical strips
[2022-12-07 06:25:44] <%Ahzathoth> @itsspacemoose also remember the texture for chromatic iron has only 4 spots per side
[2022-12-07 06:25:48] <maagicknight999> ah well

[2022-12-07 07:45:54] <%SiegeKent> do you want to filter your chest?
[2022-12-07 07:46:11] <%S3rp3nt_007> the flamarang scares me now

[2022-12-07 07:47:20] <%SiegeKent> without filtered link cables, the items will just go into random chest
[2022-12-07 07:47:20] <parthgore> so do u want certain things to go in only certain chests?
[2022-12-07 07:47:23] <@%AnonymousJ143> baboFish
[2022-12-07 07:47:47] <%S3rp3nt_007> do you want to make sure your chests arent mixed up?
[2022-12-07 07:47:49] <parthgore> if not then u can do it now
[2022-12-07 07:47:50] <%morpheus7078> at least for these chests in front right?
[2022-12-07 07:47:56] <WerupySteven> that will make it very very complicated :D
[2022-12-07 07:47:58] <mhdihqq> very
[2022-12-07 07:47:59] <%SiegeKent> uhm simple since you have blocks in chest already
[2022-12-07 07:48:00] <%cthulhu_mau5> dont do that imo lol
[2022-12-07 07:48:03] <brainyfighter> very annoying for a pleb like u KEKW
[2022-12-07 07:48:07] <@%zvr1> prolly very annoying
[2022-12-07 07:48:09] <parthgore> if yes then make filtered cables
[2022-12-07 07:48:17] <parthgore> and its very tideous
[2022-12-07 07:48:20] <%S3rp3nt_007> keep is filtered for the from and non filtered for the back
[2022-12-07 07:48:35] <%S3rp3nt_007> front*
[2022-12-07 07:48:41] <%SiegeKent> so you wanna filter the existing ones okay
[2022-12-07 07:48:42] <NahPsyk> It's one of those tedious things that it only really needs to be done once.
[2022-12-07 07:48:47] <%SiegeKent> yep
[2022-12-07 07:48:53] <%S3rp3nt_007> yeah 60 of them
[2022-12-07 07:48:53] VIEWERS: 1 184
[2022-12-07 07:48:54] <zensway> dont do filtered, it caused a bunch of lag at petes base,
[2022-12-07 07:48:57] <%S3rp3nt_007> cause you have 60 chests
[2022-12-07 07:49:00] <zunigad000> Abe you been streaming since I left for work and now I’m back home already
[2022-12-07 07:49:02] <%+lalabriar> POG
[2022-12-07 07:49:06] <parthgore> i would say u dont really need filter as u are not going to open chests anyway
[2022-12-07 07:49:07] <%SiegeKent> count your chest
[2022-12-07 07:49:11] <%goober_stoober> Does he have create unlocked cause the create vault multi block works soooo well for the back up overflow storage

[2022-12-07 07:49:31] <%SiegeKent> 60 filtered link cables yep
[2022-12-07 07:50:03] <zensway> @Abe Hellfire or Wutax told pete to get rid of the filtered cables when Pete had them setup, i'd check and see if they are still causing massive server lag

[2022-12-07 07:50:35] <NahPsyk> @zensway was that before or after the crab incident? Because I think they found out it was the crabs not the chests.
[2022-12-07 07:50:39] <%cthulhu_mau5> 1 per chest
[2022-12-07 07:50:41] <Grantybird> i think each double chest only needs one conection
[2022-12-07 07:50:45] <%SiegeKent> Writing this for Filters : Rightclick the filter cable , increase priority , allow list then import content as filter

[2022-12-07 08:09:42] <rohitjha941> Connect them togeather by network cable
[2022-12-07 08:09:45] <mmdonuts> now connect with normal cables to root
[2022-12-07 08:09:49] <buddyflurb> connect everything with cable to network root

[2022-12-07 08:10:18] <%cthulhu_mau5> the root doesn't need to be accessible
[2022-12-07 08:10:39] <rohitjha941> yes
[2022-12-07 08:10:44] <%potdesu> you can put the Root anywhere as long as there's a network cable connected into it to power the Crafting Terminal
[2022-12-07 08:10:48] <buddyflurb> you don't even need that one cable access the whole side
[2022-12-07 08:10:54] VIEWERS: 1 130
[2022-12-07 08:10:55] <Hooters1234> Probably should do filters first
[2022-12-07 08:11:08] <buddyflurb> saves you half the cables
[2022-12-07 08:11:28] <Brandon10735> No, one row connecting the birch chests and then some connections the link cables to the purple cables.
[2022-12-07 08:11:29] <WerupySteven> you waste a lot of cables :D
[2022-12-07 08:11:31] <parthgore> remove the ones that dont connect anything

[2022-12-07 08:12:01] <buddyflurb> yeah
[2022-12-07 08:12:14] <verqix> better to do minimum cables since they are multiblocks that keep checking for new connections around them

[2022-12-07 08:33:53] <memphio95> you can keep your storage kind of neat by setting all the waterlogged chests to priority 1, so the hidden chests are filled first
[2022-12-07 08:33:53] <parthgore> yea i feel like filtering not worth it when u can just acces everything through one block
[2022-12-07 08:33:53] <spillenbeen> Why would you filter?

[2022-12-07 08:58:39] <brainyfighter> let him learn the hard way..he will run one vault and then put all items in ssn and ruin all the designs
[2022-12-07 08:58:41] <%SiegeKent> you can use the request table for inserting items in and it will just put it in chest randomly

[2022-12-07 09:02:57] <SkammyZ> The filter puts items into the chests but doesnt "sort" them visually in the chest. Also the filter needs to be on a lower filter number to be prioritized (if you didnt do that already

[2022-12-07 09:19:10] <tsukkana> what abt using the same block as the pillars framing it
[2022-12-07 09:19:11] <am_andrew> ledge on the top ?
[2022-12-07 09:19:15] <tsukkana> so it looks like a beam
[2022-12-07 09:19:15] <%+lalabriar> Maybe put the terminal in the floor?
[2022-12-07 09:19:16] <brainyfighter> it is even..it needs to be odd KEKW
[2022-12-07 09:19:17] <parthgore> just put a beam above
[2022-12-07 09:19:32] <chinbinchin> maybe some stairs into slabs to flush it in shrugEg
[2022-12-07 09:19:34] <b4dbrad> upside down stairs at the top?
[2022-12-07 09:19:35] <GerbilOfWolves> Put it up for one row, and crying obsidian at the bottom?

[2022-12-07 09:19:59] <%+Taticles> Yeah a beam along the top with the same blocks as the pillars on the side would work
[2022-12-07 09:20:02] <NotSkilledUE> make one layer of stair blocks
[2022-12-07 09:20:02] <+Wingrage> You can just have two terminals on top of each other?
[2022-12-07 09:20:10] <%+lalabriar> Recess the wall and amke a stand or whatever for the terminal
