[2022-12-11 22:03:44] <%LaboePlay> lv40 is t4 implicits
[2022-12-11 22:03:46] <Filsklor> 20 craft for 1.7%...
[2022-12-11 22:03:50] <%+LaLaBriar> yeaaah
[2022-12-11 22:04:07] <+Tezerok> cutting it down to a 10th was too much for sure
[2022-12-11 22:04:25] <Filsklor> so 1176 craft for 100 % :)
[2022-12-11 22:04:30] <@%zvr1> how much do u think would be more fair?
[2022-12-11 22:04:37] <Filsklor> seems totally reasonable...

[2022-12-11 22:05:17] <%+LaLaBriar> yeah
[2022-12-11 22:05:33] <%+LaLaBriar> the 10 is just discouraging
[2022-12-11 22:05:43] <+wheaties23> you dont know the loot tables for higher levels though. you might get 5x the ingots
[2022-12-11 22:05:48] <+STELLARMN> 1200 gold
[2022-12-11 22:05:53] <%samm35_> I feel like 0.1-1% would be good
[2022-12-11 22:05:59] <%Zachattacker1234> Hey Abe, do you know what time Ryan is going to be in your stream or Wendy's?
[2022-12-11 22:06:02] <+ArmadilloTea> they shoulda just made it so it it slowly becomes harder to increase it, first few crafts give you more % then the closer you come to master, the harder it is to 'perfect'
[2022-12-11 22:06:07] <sofiane_mrch> i don't think you can get even 50% by level 60
[2022-12-11 22:06:42] <$mjolnir_hd> check how many coin piles mined
[2022-12-11 22:06:47] <%samm35_> also, you haven't leveled from half of your vaults because of level difference
[2022-12-11 22:06:48] <sofiane_mrch> this is a close gamba hmm
[2022-12-11 22:06:55] <%+dsaurous> Is there an actual end game for vault hunter? Like a final boss/level?
[2022-12-11 22:06:55] VIEWERS: 1¬†345
[2022-12-11 22:06:59] <%+hondaley> instead of adding end game content, making things harder or slower to increase the longevity of the game doesn't make sense at all
[2022-12-11 22:07:00] <@%zvr1> yeah no shot 100% by 60
[2022-12-11 22:07:06] <KatHioo> @sofiane_mrch you would actually only grind gold and dont do anything else to get 50%
[2022-12-11 22:07:07] <+fr0gar> quick question abe, are axes better than sword?
[2022-12-11 22:07:16] <kriptou21> i thinks iskall said that starting from lvl 50 coin piles start dropping platinum coins
[2022-12-11 22:07:55] <%+LaLaBriar> maybe gold drop rate increases too?
[2022-12-11 22:08:13] <@%zvr1> if ur playing in a single player server there is no shot u get to 100% by level 60
