Balancewise is kinda okay-ish on the lower tiers as the armament is roughly similiar, but once you climb the BR it would get ridiclious OP to the Naval side. Playing Air in Higher tier Naval is absolute broken. Ships have AI gunners with Proxy Fuse Shells against early WW2 planes

[2023-01-06 23:43:10] <JonyVole> and the USS Texas was the only ship to hit far back entrenchment on D-Day by literally flooding half the ship to get extra range, literally gangsta firing a battleship. so it stood up to its name by being crazy
[2023-01-06 23:43:14] <!%NiteAssassin_> @mrsndstrm yes cuz they sunk it musicmommyHyperNod
[2023-01-06 23:43:29] <creeprgenesis> his name was Ivan Pavlovich Sereda
[2023-01-06 23:43:33] <+ArmyDog92> texas isnt that impressive. thats a literal in the book tactic
[2023-01-06 23:43:45] <JonyVole> but she was the only one so
[2023-01-06 23:43:47] <+Kriegwulf> the USS Texas flooded parts of itself to get more elevation, was the only ship to hit all of its targets during D-day
[2023-01-06 23:43:51] <Gamer17138> fun fact uss texas was the only us ship to hit its targets on dday because they flooded one side of the ship
[2023-01-06 23:44:07] <+ArmyDog92> they were designed to that, but the situation just never arose until then
[2023-01-06 23:44:18] <+Lufishshmebb> woah you mean to say that the USS Texas flooded itself? I've NEVER heard that before! Kappa
[2023-01-06 23:44:23] <%MrSndstrm> @niteassassin_ indeed, and saying that a sub sank a train sounds way cooler than "they sent a shore party"

[2023-01-06 23:45:08] <+Kaiser_Fluffywuffy> they did that during D-day, practically beached the ship to shoot further inland. Imagine being a german sniper and the americans call in 14" battleship guns to countersnipe

[2023-01-06 23:45:21] <+Lufishshmebb> Counter-Flooding is a real damage control tactic ships used during the wars Swat, if you're taking flooding on one side of the ship you flood some sections on the other part to correct the tilt the ship is taking on
[2023-01-06 23:45:30] <+ArmyDog92> well the situation wasnt behind them lmao

[2023-01-06 23:46:18] <!%NiteAssassin_> Ships is listing one way just add a bit more in the other then get it all out
[2023-01-06 23:46:23] <JonyVole> @Lufishshmebb really depends, average ship is kinda hard to say

[2023-01-06 23:50:19] <%MrSndstrm> about the USS Texas flooding, what they flooded was a torpedo bulge. those were meant to contain flooding in case of torpedo impact so flooding there wouldn't get to the main hull anyway
