[2022-12-10 00:37:50] <sagadelic> @klean Outta curiosity, you ever hear about a game called Cataclysm Dark Days Ahead? It's in a similiar vein to DF, prettier default graphics but equally in-depth for a more adventure/survival apocalyptic kinda experience.
[2022-12-10 00:38:11] <sagadelic> And still equally an acid trip. LUL

[2022-12-10 00:43:44] <@%+Sev07Sniper> @onkel__tuca I'm hoping that because he's playing and enjoying this. he might actually try Rimworld
[2022-12-10 00:43:47] <%Freckles619> The dwarves don't seem too particular about bedrooms
[2022-12-10 00:43:50] <+Venmarks> I like that you dont stick with same game. It keeps the channel refreshing

[2022-12-10 01:02:50] <lajeok> Is there a way to get rid of monsterhunters once you allow them into your tavern?
[2022-12-10 01:02:50] <sagadelic> Water pumps also purify it I believe.
[2022-12-10 01:02:50] <LittlewingEC> @Roberto_The_Robot You can set specific patrol routes for squads and order them to attack specific targets and such. Just can't control each one at a time. So still a good bit of control.

[2022-12-10 01:03:21] <+islandl1fe> they also make your dwarf really strong
[2022-12-10 01:03:22] <Roberto_The_Robot> so if you hit a water source like a river at a diagonal angle it robs the water of all of its flow force from the origional water source so its MUCH easier to control
[2022-12-10 01:03:25] <latedoomer> with a hand carved irrigated cavern
[2022-12-10 01:03:29] <+islandl1fe> if its the manual screw type
[2022-12-10 01:03:36] <%thenamesshane> channel a river into the fort? what kinda vooodoo is that.

[2022-12-10 01:09:04] <Roberto_The_Robot> yeah, a nice trick is to have your engravers train down in the mines and then once they're all legendary come up and engrave your common areas to be SUPER nice
[2022-12-10 01:09:07] <Z_ynthia> @Klean keep in mind tho, statues and altars in a temple that get knocked over will curse the one that did it

[2022-12-10 01:41:49] <Z_ynthia> @Klean also idk if u are aware, but on the pickaxe " dig tool" theres extra settings on the right side, if u press auto and mark an ore vein, they will keep diggin that vein til its empty
[2022-12-10 01:41:54] <CS_Hague> Otherwise they will whine about sharing a crowded table

[2022-12-10 01:45:41] <Burepishta> The claim them, just gotta mark them as bedrooms
[2022-12-10 01:45:41] <Roberto_The_Robot> in the beds
[2022-12-10 01:45:41] <NorthernGambit> they take the auto
[2022-12-10 01:45:41] <+islandl1fe> they will take them automaticlaly but it is good to assign certain ones like nobles bookkeeepers and managers
[2022-12-10 01:45:42] <AlsoAqua> I like how you always play niche games I haven't heard of
[2022-12-10 01:45:46] <sagadelic> Assign I do. believe.
[2022-12-10 01:45:47] <Z_ynthia> @Klean aslong as u ahve a bedroom properly setup someone will claim one if there is one open
[2022-12-10 01:45:54] <+prodek> @Z_ynthia dunno what that means but i take it that lots of love have been put into this game, always wanted to try it but now since it had a graphic update i might give it a go
[2022-12-10 01:45:55] <CS_Hague> You can set rooms to be vacant too which will keep them from being grabbed
[2022-12-10 01:45:56] <jonah0_0> @klean theyl claim them on there own but i think it could lead to fighting
[2022-12-10 01:45:58] <ChaosPainter> make the bedrooms and you are good
[2022-12-10 01:46:00] <Caffeine_Rx> you can also assign bedrooms for the important people

[2022-12-10 01:46:32] <NorthernGambit> it's all automatic, first come first serve I guess. Married couples take a room together
[2022-12-10 01:46:36] <Roberto_The_Robot> you'd want to keep your legendary axedwarf from going into a gage, etc
[2022-12-10 01:46:42] <Roberto_The_Robot> going into a rage*
[2022-12-10 01:46:50] VIEWERS: 782
[2022-12-10 01:47:04] <CS_Hague> Yeah, the nobles and professions will require a certain quality of bedroom, their own dining room, etc.
[2022-12-10 01:47:20] <+islandl1fe> the thing is too the rooms you make later on usually have the better furniture as your dwarves have gotten much better.
[2022-12-10 01:47:25] <+islandl1fe> those rooms are higher appeal
[2022-12-10 01:47:34] <%Ghoulsie> They want that FANCY livin!
[2022-12-10 01:47:39] <+prodek> @Z_ynthia that defo feels like super in-depth, i feel like i would get lost v easily
[2022-12-10 01:47:50] <Roberto_The_Robot> yep, its also why I recommend holding off on engraving the common areas till later when your engravers are way better
[2022-12-10 01:47:51] <CS_Hague> It adds up the value of the walls, floors and furniture to determine the room quality
[2022-12-10 01:48:06] <Z_ynthia> prodek well it takes almost 100 hrs to get good at the basics
[2022-12-10 01:48:20] <+islandl1fe> yea its like children draw permantly on the walls or experts
[2022-12-10 01:48:35] <Z_ynthia> and then u ahve all the diffrent biomes and whatnot to expand the difficulty

[2022-12-10 01:49:04] <Roberto_The_Robot> yeah, embarking in an idyllic meadow is MUCH different than embarking in the shadow of a necromancers tower in blighted land
[2022-12-10 01:49:11] <+prodek> @Z_ynthia going to have to buy it and give it a go, I always liked in depth games, stalker anomaly was my jam
[2022-12-10 01:49:16] <CS_Hague> Ah, yes, nothing like being like "Ooh, a unicorn." and then realizing that someone is dead, stomped and impaled by said unicorn

[2022-12-10 01:49:41] <Roberto_The_Robot> yeah, a chest for clothing storage
[2022-12-10 01:49:46] <Z_ynthia> prodek well if u want to try it out u can get the lazy newb pack from their mainapge for free, sadly there is no mouse support yet
[2022-12-10 01:49:51] <Roberto_The_Robot> and wardrobe if i remember correctly?
[2022-12-10 01:50:02] <Roberto_The_Robot> its usually better to have one SUPER nice common dining room
[2022-12-10 01:50:13] <Roberto_The_Robot> then individual rooms
[2022-12-10 01:50:15] <+islandl1fe> yes you can do that
[2022-12-10 01:50:15] <Z_ynthia> and lazy newb is good since u get the tileset, so u dont ahve to deal with the ascii xD
[2022-12-10 01:50:31] <CS_Hague> Yeah, it's only nobles who will require their own dining room
[2022-12-10 01:50:31] <Roberto_The_Robot> but certain positions/nobles will need a private dining space
[2022-12-10 01:50:50] VIEWERS: 798
[2022-12-10 01:51:05] <CS_Hague> But there can be other reasons to assign other dining areas if you keep facilities and homes for dwarves in other parts of the map
[2022-12-10 01:51:44] <CS_Hague> You can but it will divide the value of the room by 6
[2022-12-10 01:51:52] <CS_Hague> Or was it 8? I forget

[2022-12-10 01:57:10] <CS_Hague> You'll need to make some ladders if you want dwarfs to gather fruit and nuts
[2022-12-10 01:57:26] <+perceptivettv> you'll definitely want to look up guides it only gives you the tip of the iceberg @prodek
[2022-12-10 01:57:35] <+perceptivettv> doesnt cover like half of the different systems
[2022-12-10 01:57:38] <+Reaperrevenge94> tutorial practically does nothing in this game lol
[2022-12-10 01:57:50] <Z_ynthia> prodek vanilla doesnt ahe tutorial, and steam only scratches the top layer, so guides are def worth, unless ur like klean and go in blind
[2022-12-10 01:57:56] <%+DollaDSheets> @Z_ynthia It teaches you some basics, but at the same time the tutorial will give you bad habits If you dont how how to apply what they are trying to teach
[2022-12-10 01:57:57] <jonah0_0> @Reaperrevenge94 did you set up a zone for hunting and fighing?
[2022-12-10 01:58:20] <+perceptivettv> learn how to setup a military and hospital would be good steps after the tutorial

[2022-12-10 02:45:30] <Roberto_The_Robot> hopefully someone moods metalworking so you can have a master blacksmith
[2022-12-10 02:45:34] <+HappyHobnob> I read that the strange moods can only occure once your at or above 20 pop, but dont take my word for that.
[2022-12-10 02:46:19] <CS_Hague> @Roberto_The_Robot Only someone with metalworking as their highest moodable skill will get it
[2022-12-10 02:46:39] <old_zaweri> Be careful what you wish for, you may get a fell mood and have your bonecarver/leatherworker turn your carpenter into a bone helmet
[2022-12-10 02:46:45] <old_zaweri> That happened to me once LUL
[2022-12-10 02:47:06] <CS_Hague> if the barrels are assigned to other stockpiles as storage vessels they won't use them for drinks
[2022-12-10 02:47:11] <sagadelic> One way to force strange moods is sticking a Peasant on constant crafting duty like smiting and it'll probably eventually trigger while he's crafting up a storm.

[2022-12-10 02:48:35] <old_zaweri> There is a mod that lets you play as any civ, meaning gobs, kobolds, elves, humans etc @Rambomst those are interesting
[2022-12-10 02:48:49] <sagadelic> @old_zaweri Oh yeah, as much as it pains me to admit it. This legendary Elf asked to join up and he has shown up my axedwarves so many times now. LUL Definitely worth taking him into our fold.

[2022-12-10 02:50:00] <Roberto_The_Robot> things have value depending on material and quality of craft
[2022-12-10 02:50:07] <StarLordsSpaceYoga> F it, I bought the game. I've played enough classic DF that they deserve it.
[2022-12-10 02:50:10] <sagadelic> @old_zaweri Last I checked, he did not. He may as well! Fights as if he has Dwarven blood that's for sure.
[2022-12-10 02:50:15] <7thtradecentre> everything has a value, you trade value for value, the more the civ likes you the better deal they will give

[2022-12-10 03:37:59] <hristanya_> How many layers do you guys go down?
[2022-12-10 03:38:15] <+mrhezikiah> all depends on what you're looking for
[2022-12-10 03:38:35] <+ttvworlok1025> @Klean you dont have any issue of old age with dwarfs right
[2022-12-10 03:38:41] <+mrhezikiah> some of the rarer materials are deeper but then you also run into really tough monsters
[2022-12-10 03:38:49] <%Ljosapaldr> @hristanya_ As many as I need for caverns

[2022-12-10 03:40:55] <Fallen_Hero98> Recruits can train unarmed or with wooden weapons, don't give them metal yet, it can get messy
[2022-12-10 03:40:59] <+mrhezikiah> engraving is always good. Your dwarves love beautiful stuff
[2022-12-10 03:41:14] <gavin_cl> nice base i like it

[2022-12-10 03:41:47] <%Ljosapaldr> @Fallen_Hero98 old information, training is fine since around when danger rooms got depreciated
[2022-12-10 03:42:12] <gavin_cl> what are you doing for food? my fortress is running low because i have like 100 pop or something
[2022-12-10 03:42:44] <%Ljosapaldr> @gavin_cl do you gather what the trees drop yearly?
[2022-12-10 03:42:58] <+Odanel> @gavin_cl The obvious answer is always, more plump helmets
[2022-12-10 03:43:01] <gavin_cl> @gavin_cl no, i didn't know they dropped anything
[2022-12-10 03:43:06] <Fallen_Hero98> @Fallen_Hero98 i see, yet i like to train my guys with wrestling too since it can be valuable if they get disarmed
[2022-12-10 03:43:18] <gavin_cl> @gavin_cl how do i let them eat the plump helmets? i've just been brewing them
[2022-12-10 03:43:26] VIEWERS: 766
[2022-12-10 03:44:00] <+Odanel> I think you can set them to cook too
[2022-12-10 03:44:05] <+Odanel> someone correct me if im wrong
[2022-12-10 03:44:08] <%Ljosapaldr> don't cook them
[2022-12-10 03:44:14] <%Ljosapaldr> cooking destroys seeds
[2022-12-10 03:44:20] <+Odanel> well of coures
[2022-12-10 03:44:26] <+Odanel> cooking destroys seeds
[2022-12-10 03:44:35] <%Ljosapaldr> brewing and grinding doesn't
[2022-12-10 03:44:37] <gavin_cl> well, i dont want them to cook them because i want the spawn
[2022-12-10 03:44:38] <+Odanel> but if you have thousands of plump helmets... you know
[2022-12-10 03:45:00] <%Ljosapaldr> yeah but then you start it and forget it and next you know you must brave the deeps or buy new seeds

[2022-12-10 03:48:14] <%Ljosapaldr> @Klean so it's actually a steamdf thing, that the more you mess with nature, the more aggro it becomes. This was *not* a thing before. Fishing, cutting down trees and hunting is making stuff like that giant crow happen.

[2022-12-10 04:07:02] <%qbixrube> I guess you could setup a chamber where your dwarves would empty cages into, so that way your invaders have to fight shit you catch in cage traps, releasing from cages is risky tho

[2022-12-10 04:15:51] <%Ljosapaldr> @sagadelic No warhammers are great, *especially* silver. You're probably thinking they're bad because they're bad when made of adamantine.
[2022-12-10 04:16:37] <%Ljosapaldr> Blunt weapons rely on the mass of the material, heavy material, strong warhammer. Adamantium is light as a feather.

[2022-12-10 05:31:06] <Ardaburious> A fun fact - if anyone wonders why they called it 'tetrahedrite' instead of just plain 'copper ore' - the game actually simulates geological layering as it occurs in real world, and realistically depicts specific minerals that can occur in said layers

[2022-12-10 05:33:14] <+Kanbyen> yea you can't dig under bridge correctly once bridge is in
[2022-12-10 05:33:20] <+islandl1fe> just make sure it retracts to the right
[2022-12-10 05:33:26] <+islandl1fe> eff left
[2022-12-10 05:33:28] <+Kanbyen> trader wagons require 3 wide
[2022-12-10 05:33:37] <+Kanbyen> I'd channel down a few times then square it
[2022-12-10 05:33:45] <%+henryho96> channel

[2022-12-10 05:34:25] <+islandl1fe> no need dig or channel
[2022-12-10 05:34:38] <BoochBoocho> you can just place the bridge on the ground, and make it retract to the left
[2022-12-10 05:34:47] <+islandl1fe> or should i say not retract but pulls up left

[2022-12-10 05:36:30] <+islandl1fe> @Necromunger no there is 1 speed
[2022-12-10 05:36:38] <Necromunger> ok all good
[2022-12-10 05:36:43] <hubris_zero> You can change speed in game settings.
[2022-12-10 05:36:43] <Necromunger> thanks
[2022-12-10 05:36:47] <hubris_zero> It's under game fps.
[2022-12-10 05:36:55] <Shadzykin> @Necromunger Your game speed is tied to FPS, so  you can change that
[2022-12-10 05:37:02] <hubris_zero> Default is 100, you can set it to 50.
[2022-12-10 05:37:17] <hubris_zero> Well, there's game fps and there's visual fps.
[2022-12-10 05:37:48] <$dennydsoach> how would you explain this game to a monkey brained like is it similar to other games?

[2022-12-10 05:38:28] <hubris_zero> @dennydsoach It's the inspiration for Minecraft, Prison Architect, Rimworld, Terraria, etc.
[2022-12-10 05:38:34] <Ardaburious> @dennydsoach It is a much more complex but less refined rimworld
[2022-12-10 05:38:37] <hubris_zero> @dennydsoach Basically Rimworld on crack.
[2022-12-10 05:38:42] <$dennydsoach> ooh wow
[2022-12-10 05:38:50] <$dennydsoach> thats cool thanks
[2022-12-10 05:38:55] <hubris_zero> There's also an adventure mode where you can control one person.
[2022-12-10 05:38:57] <+islandl1fe> front door dogs have to be set to a pen that you have made
[2022-12-10 05:39:03] <$dennydsoach> wasnt sure if it was more like age of empires
[2022-12-10 05:39:03] <hubris_zero> But that's not in this version yet.
[2022-12-10 05:39:13] <+Kanbyen> just an area you assign dogs too
[2022-12-10 05:39:29] <+Kanbyen> animal pen or training pet area
[2022-12-10 05:39:29] <GIGO1st> man klean your dwarfs are realy into traps eh LuL
[2022-12-10 05:39:34] <+islandl1fe> they will catch the kobold and goblin thieves
[2022-12-10 05:39:34] <hubris_zero> @dennydsoach It's less of a game and more of a fantasy world simulation. The game starts with you generating several hundred years of history.
[2022-12-10 05:39:35] <StarLordsSpaceYoga> When I put dogs to guard a front door I think I had to leash them with like rope or chain

[2022-12-10 05:40:29] <hubris_zero> @dennydsoach You then interact with this world in either fortress mode or adventure mode. In fortress mode, it's Riimworld. In adventure mode, it's Skyrim.
[2022-12-10 05:40:38] <+islandl1fe> you dont have to leash them
[2022-12-10 05:40:44] <%+o0HERO0o> This game looks so overwhelming......lol I have to try it!
[2022-12-10 05:40:48] <%Ljosapaldr> no
[2022-12-10 05:40:52] <%Ljosapaldr> training makes them better
[2022-12-10 05:40:56] <StarLordsSpaceYoga> Like, build the "restraint" and once built you should be able to pick the animal to restrain there
[2022-12-10 05:40:58] <%Ljosapaldr> but leashing is just a robe or chain
[2022-12-10 05:41:03] <+Kanbyen> Set a zone with Z  or face icon
[2022-12-10 05:41:06] <%Ljosapaldr> rope*
[2022-12-10 05:41:09] <+Kanbyen> then click on zone add dogs
[2022-12-10 05:41:09] <+islandl1fe> that is an animal training zone
[2022-12-10 05:41:15] <%Ljosapaldr> training is a zone
[2022-12-10 05:41:19] <%Ljosapaldr> leashing is a building
[2022-12-10 05:41:34] <Ardaburious> There is a building that is essentially a rope/chain, that you can attach a dog to
[2022-12-10 05:41:35] <+islandl1fe> that trains but to make them stay you would need a animal pen acros the front door
[2022-12-10 05:41:49] <%Ljosapaldr> u > animals > mark for training
[2022-12-10 05:42:00] <%Ljosapaldr> same as slaughtering, just a different button

[2022-12-10 06:12:29] <xxxinterceptxxx> there were two thieves I believe, if you go to the creatures screen you can sort by other and look for threats

[2022-12-10 06:12:37] <zamoro285> theres a 2nd thief

[2022-12-10 06:13:48] <%Ljosapaldr> well dwarf personalities vary
[2022-12-10 06:13:51] <%Ljosapaldr> some would charge them

[2022-12-10 06:14:07] <hubris_zero> Basically, in addition to procedurally generating history, DF is also going to add in procedural myths and magic systems for each world.
[2022-12-10 06:14:08] <@%SamuraiSavv> lmao
[2022-12-10 06:14:10] <%Ljosapaldr> when I got attacked by that weredeer, 5 dwarves just fucking charged the first one, despite not being military dwarves

[2022-12-10 06:17:00] <hubris_zero> And the ability to traverse different dimensional planes too. So you can have stuff like the afterlife.

[2022-12-10 06:17:18] <Ardaburious> @hubris_zero Look mate, I do not want to be that guy, but you probably should tame your expectations. I have been hearing about 'Dwarven economy' coming to DF for last like 12 years, so...
[2022-12-10 06:17:35] <%xxxinterceptxxx> @hubris_zero keep in mind thats 2 years or more down the road
[2022-12-10 06:17:40] <hubris_zero> @hubris_zero That's after Myth and Magic. And may be either before or after boats.
[2022-12-10 06:17:46] <MichonOBL> was dungeon keeper inspired by DF?
[2022-12-10 06:17:47] <%KlngofGods> Nothing wrong with dreaming @Ardaburious
[2022-12-10 06:17:57] <%KlngofGods> Nah don't think so Michon
[2022-12-10 06:18:00] <hubris_zero> Well, the first ting to look toward is the rest of the villians arc update.
[2022-12-10 06:18:03] <%KlngofGods> Cause dungeon keeper is way older
[2022-12-10 06:18:08] <Noeat> @MichonOBL Dungeon Keeper is older afaik
[2022-12-10 06:18:09] <hubris_zero> Which is probably going to come this year.
[2022-12-10 06:18:12] <%KlngofGods> dungeon keeper is 1996 and DF is 2002

[2022-12-10 06:18:43] <hubris_zero> Adventure mode is going to take a while to add though. Since Tarn will have to redo that whole UI.
[2022-12-10 06:18:50] <%KlngofGods> Dungeon keeper is amazing though, I think that's one of my favourite games
[2022-12-10 06:19:01] <Ardaburious> @KlngofGods No, but DF's development cycle makes Tarkov look like the fastest developing game on earth, that always delivers on time
[2022-12-10 06:19:10] <hubris_zero> Don't know how he's going to make stuff like tearing individual fingers off of enemies intuitive to control.
[2022-12-10 06:19:16] <MichonOBL> made my childhood amazing game
[2022-12-10 06:19:17] <Noeat> @MichonOBL but it can be opposite.. it looks like DF was inspired by Dungeon Keeper and maybe Master of Magic...
[2022-12-10 06:19:40] <hubris_zero> DF was inspired by Dungeon Keeper, I think I heard Tarn say once.
[2022-12-10 06:19:42] <MichonOBL> yeah maybe..

[2022-12-10 06:20:34] <%Freckles619> wow, up to 90
[2022-12-10 06:21:03] <+tahn_> Tarn definitely has a great name
[2022-12-10 06:21:09] <%KlngofGods> @Ardaburious People still say the samething about tarkov also their development team is way different
[2022-12-10 06:21:23] <hubris_zero> But he'll probably update the game along the way. For example, I think I hread that he plans to give us improved world gen early.
[2022-12-10 06:21:23] <TheDandyGuy> is it still just the two brothers making this game? thought they would have had help given the steam release and all
[2022-12-10 06:21:36] <hubris_zero> @TheDandyGuy They had the help of artists and musicians.
[2022-12-10 06:22:10] <hubris_zero> Only Tarn does the programming.
[2022-12-10 06:22:15] <%Ljosapaldr> @hubris_zero we had economy already, it was awful KEKW and got removed again

[2022-12-10 06:22:52] <%Ljosapaldr> tarn is the actual developer
[2022-12-10 06:23:09] <hubris_zero> I'm also eagerly waiting for more laws.
[2022-12-10 06:23:16] <Ardaburious> Also, I am pretty sure there were more people of kitfox involved in making this game approachable for the steam release
[2022-12-10 06:23:19] <+islandl1fe> zach does alot of the writing
[2022-12-10 06:23:23] <TheDandyGuy> I can only imagine the code for this game is such a mess no other human could comprehend it
[2022-12-10 06:23:58] <hubris_zero> @Ardaburious Tarn is the sole person responsible for the programming.
[2022-12-10 06:24:02] <+islandl1fe> anyone here have a custom crayon art?

[2022-12-10 06:24:25] <Ardaburious> @Ardaburious For og DF - you sure about the steam version?
[2022-12-10 06:24:27] <%Ljosapaldr> but there's still only 1 coder
[2022-12-10 06:24:35] <%Ljosapaldr> @Ardaburious yes, I'm sure
[2022-12-10 06:24:37] <TheDandyGuy> this has steam workshop right? mods could do some crazy stuff
[2022-12-10 06:24:38] <Noeat> @Ljosapaldr tbh thats not "only" anyone can write code... ideas and playability is whats matters
[2022-12-10 06:24:55] <hubris_zero> When Myth and Magic comes out, that's going to be like Dwarf Fortress 2.0 for me. Even though Tarn willl probably consider it 0.6.
[2022-12-10 06:25:09] <%Ljosapaldr> @Noeat it's "only" when 99% of this game is its deep simulation lol
[2022-12-10 06:25:18] <TheDandyGuy> can you name the pets?
[2022-12-10 06:25:24] <TheDandyGuy> you should name them after chat LUL
[2022-12-10 06:25:42] <Ardaburious> @Ardaburious Okay, then I should give him more credit than I originally did
[2022-12-10 06:25:50] <hubris_zero> There's already magic mods for Dwarf Fortress, but it'll be nothing compared to what Tarn will design.

If Zach passed from his cancer, which is what motivated the steam release (healthcare expensive in the US) then DF continues, if Tarn dies DF is gone.

[2022-12-10 06:48:22] <Slavgineer> whats poppin klean

[2022-12-10 06:49:37] <BoochBoocho> @Taithleach94 Look into a KVM switch. plug everyting into the device and then just toggle the switch

[2022-12-10 07:18:03] <aimLegs> i read somewhere that the speed of the game is tied to the fps that its running out, do you have it set to a certain fps @klean ?

[2022-12-10 07:19:03] <StarLordsSpaceYoga> @Klean turn off temperature if you want to help performance
[2022-12-10 07:19:16] <aimLegs> i read somewhere that the game has a strange function where it runs faster on higher fps, as in the speed of the actual game
[2022-12-10 07:19:17] <+Robknightt> im pretty sure the game speed is tied to the fps
[2022-12-10 07:19:27] <%Ljosapaldr> fps = gamespeed
[2022-12-10 07:19:28] <aimLegs> like how fast everything is happening is tied to fps
[2022-12-10 07:19:34] <+TheSoupNaz> claim it
[2022-12-10 07:19:36] <aimLegs> exactly ^
[2022-12-10 07:19:43] <%Ljosapaldr> it's a setting
[2022-12-10 07:19:43] <aimLegs> so be careful increasing frame rate @Klean
[2022-12-10 07:20:28] <aimLegs> thats what i was asking you cause I have no idea
[2022-12-10 07:20:30] <%Ljosapaldr> you can change the settings on it in labor > standing orders > sieges and forbidding
[2022-12-10 07:20:33] <aimLegs> thought maybe you would know
[2022-12-10 07:20:38] VIEWERS: 727
[2022-12-10 07:20:39] <cubes158> changing the game FPS in the setting is how you manipulate game speed....... I like 50 is a chill speed, it gives you time to react to stuff
[2022-12-10 07:20:41] <hubris_zero> That's the graphical fps that doesn't affect the speed.
[2022-12-10 07:20:44] <+Robknightt> some like it slower but its preference
[2022-12-10 07:20:46] <Grinbale> @Klean thats graphics fps if you want to lower speed of the game you need to go in the game settings and lower game fps setting
[2022-12-10 07:20:52] <%KlngofGods> That's good to know I thought the game was a bit too quick sometimes
[2022-12-10 07:20:59] <hubris_zero> The game frame rate is under "game".
[2022-12-10 07:21:31] <cubes158> yup
[2022-12-10 07:21:35] <Grinbale> yep
[2022-12-10 07:21:35] <aimLegs> think so  yeah
[2022-12-10 07:21:38] <mydadworksatTwitch> Ie ticks
[2022-12-10 07:21:46] <cubes158> 50 is grand, especially for combat
[2022-12-10 07:21:48] <%Ljosapaldr> For the stuff being 'locked', you can go into labor > standing orders > sieges and forbidding

[2022-12-10 07:22:32] <sagadelic> Dont drawbridges make for makeshift catapults or am I remembering incorrectly?
[2022-12-10 07:22:35] <%qbixrube> you can make your squads go on patrols in certain burrows
[2022-12-10 07:22:38] <sagadelic> Or wasit atomizers?
[2022-12-10 07:22:42] VIEWERS: 727
[2022-12-10 07:22:49] <Grinbale> @Klean and graphical fps does not affect interface it works only on the sprite's animation changes
[2022-12-10 07:22:53] <%qbixrube> its good to have 2 different squads and rotate them on/off patrol to give them some time to rest
[2022-12-10 07:22:59] <+Robknightt> could also make it a tower and archer barracks
[2022-12-10 07:23:00] <hubris_zero> Yeah, your fortress is getting pretty rich now. That goblin siege was just the start of things to come.
[2022-12-10 07:23:17] <Gunning_Wild> would put a roof on that 2nd floor

[2022-12-10 08:28:28] <hubris_zero> In that case, I think the dwarves aren't being buried in your caskets because the entire zone is a tomb.
[2022-12-10 08:28:37] <hubris_zero> And only one dwarf may be assigned to a tomb.

[2022-12-10 08:30:31] <+cryoes> tombs can only have 1 coffin per zone sadly
[2022-12-10 08:30:38] <plastoid> you sometimes need to force them with a special labor I find
[2022-12-10 08:30:43] <hubris_zero> So even if you have a bunch of coffins in a single tomb, they'll only burry one.
[2022-12-10 08:30:48] <AmishHooker> Tombs are more for higher stature people you want to memorialize
[2022-12-10 08:30:50] <+cryoes> but u can make them like 1x1 squares in a big crypt and use the multi to assign alot of them
[2022-12-10 08:31:00] <hubris_zero> And I guess you have to make each coffin its own tomb.

[2022-12-10 08:35:42] <hubris_zero> @Klean, your dwarves aren't being entombed because only one dwarf can be assigned to one tomb. You have to make a zone for each coffin. Or make a bunch of small rooms of coffins and use the multi tool to assign each of them a tomb.

[2022-12-10 08:37:36] <hubris_zero> For the multi tool, each of them need to be in a separate room.
[2022-12-10 08:37:36] <%Ljosapaldr> you don't play the game clearly, multi looks for doors
[2022-12-10 08:37:49] <hlidskjalf77708> it works for bedrooms at least idk if for tombs

[2022-12-10 08:38:55] <%Ljosapaldr> if you put each coffin behind a door, the multi option will make each 'room' a toom for you, but you need a door for each then
[2022-12-10 08:39:13] VIEWERS: 744
[2022-12-10 08:39:15] <hubris_zero> multi tool should work the same for tombs as it does for bedrooms, basically, to use multi tool each coffin needs to be in a separate room. Then the multi tool will make them all invidual tombs.
[2022-12-10 08:39:19] <plastoid> anh easier to just place coffins and make 1x1 tombs
[2022-12-10 08:39:26] <cubes158> they are just trying to say that you need to have individual tomb rooms, in the same way they have individual bedrooms

Dwarf Fortress is for 25 or 30 i think. it is like RW being arcade and DF simulator.

[2022-12-10 08:58:06] <hubris_zero> They're probably putting them on and off because they're taking off their armor when they need to do something as a civilian and putting them back on when they start training?

[2022-12-10 09:01:27] <Noeat> btw: chat, i read about DF that there are books in game, where you can get info about history, or so... when my colony die, and i start over in the same world, will be there "my story" writen? can i buy book from merchant, where will be mentioned my previous colony?
[2022-12-10 09:01:29] <%Ljosapaldr> but heavy armour does make them slower
[2022-12-10 09:01:40] <hubris_zero> @Noeat Yes.
[2022-12-10 09:01:42] <%Ljosapaldr> @Noeat it can happen, yes
[2022-12-10 09:01:43] <+iinfamous159> i still dont know how to do stairs right after 5 hours lol
[2022-12-10 09:02:01] <%Ljosapaldr> @Noeat it's not a guarantee, since books written are kind of random, but it *can* happen, 100%
[2022-12-10 09:02:21] <%Ljosapaldr> Making a grand world library is one of the most fun ways to play the game actually
[2022-12-10 09:02:27] <Noeat> @Ardaburious ye, it have tons of issues (to be honest RW have more...) but it is still awesome and complex game what have "all". but it is not perfect without any flaw..
[2022-12-10 09:02:30] <%Ljosapaldr> having researcher dwarves and a full book economy
[2022-12-10 09:02:45] <hubris_zero> @Noeat You can also get some of the dwarves from your old fortress join your new one.
[2022-12-10 09:03:04] <Noeat> @hubris_zero @Ljosapaldr awesome, thanx :)
[2022-12-10 09:03:09] <HappysFunPalace> @Ardaburious can you elaborate? i only had one ui bug at this point
[2022-12-10 09:03:17] <cubes158> DF is one of those games where the more tolerance and learning you put into it, the more you get out of it

[2022-12-10 09:04:21] <%Ljosapaldr> @Ardaburious Like your dogs not having to eat, but your sheep can only eat grass, and you can't plant hay or harvest greens to feed them later; the game has a lot of gameplay oversights because most of dev time is spend on the history and world simulation that happens before you even start the 'game'
[2022-12-10 09:04:25] <HappysFunPalace> @cubes158 ye 100%, i wont recommend it to some of my friends because i know theyre not patient enough

[2022-12-10 09:06:49] <%Ljosapaldr> @Klean the best way to do the construction stuff is making preparation stockpiles next to things you want to build, so when you use 'nearest' it won't do this KEKW

[2022-12-10 09:26:39] <+DragonReaver> redhotchilihacker Yea but only the first 3 layers are usually yotr base
[2022-12-10 09:27:10] <%Ljosapaldr> @ithilious sure, but I was using slabs for everyone at first
[2022-12-10 09:27:19] <+redhotchilihacker> @DragonReaver well then im just unlucky i guess lol, i'll try your way and try to find a good soil
[2022-12-10 09:27:25] <AmishHooker> @redhotchilihacker might  be a large one, could reroll. if youre new they're difficult to deal with. i didnt go on a map with an aquafer for 6 months lol

[2022-12-10 09:28:39] <AmishHooker> i just didnt wanna deal with it LUL
[2022-12-10 09:28:40] <StarLordsSpaceYoga> You could dedicate a dwarf to hauling corpses for a time
[2022-12-10 09:28:45] <hubris_zero> You'll have to learn to deal with light aquifers eventually. They're super common. Just smooth the walls to prevent water from leaking through. Or smash the walls and construct new walls.
[2022-12-10 09:28:45] <+Kanbyen> you have haulers?

[2022-12-10 09:29:18] <+purple_0nion> iirc you have to mark things for "dumping" to get the to throw things away.
[2022-12-10 09:29:21] <+redhotchilihacker> rather than sucking
[2022-12-10 09:29:25] <ithilious> Honestly the best thing you can do is specialize your dwarfs with lots of custom tasks.

[2022-12-10 09:30:02] <ithilious> Yeah, might be out  of fresh coffins
[2022-12-10 09:30:08] <StarLordsSpaceYoga> Well your dwarfs who have dumping/hauling enabled are busy with other things. Those things are low priority. So you can dedicate a dwarf to hauling a corpse if you want

[2022-12-10 09:30:39] <cubes158> corpses werent always this bad to deal with, i think they messed something up or changed something in the steam release. usually if you have a corpse stockpile and tombs then its not even a second thought

[2022-12-10 09:30:40] <AmishHooker> after 100 pop youre pretty safe to dedicate a corpse hauler or two
[2022-12-10 09:30:45] <ithilious> DF is an experience. The more Dwarves you have the less that gets done, at least that's how it seems.
[2022-12-10 09:30:47] <Rigben> in a large room you need to paint a tomb zone on each coffin, or build single coffin rooms. a tomb zone only accepts 1 person.

[2022-12-10 09:49:51] <ithilious> Yeah, DF is like that. I'd recommend building an atom smasher. You build a bridge below and put all your dumping there, when you flip the switch all that stuff gets deleted
[2022-12-10 09:50:09] <StarLordsSpaceYoga> Temperature is simulated on everything, lower performance
[2022-12-10 09:50:10] <%Ljosapaldr> the temperature simulation
[2022-12-10 09:50:11] <ithilious> Also butchering/gelding your animals to control population helps
[2022-12-10 09:50:28] <jonah0_0> @klean there is a few things that can help with lag like circular design of you base. less walking back and forth and more all roads lead everywhere. multiple stair cases. and removed temp
[2022-12-10 09:50:40] <%Howkin_> my fort is at 190 dorfs and i'm not lagging like that, you got animals running wild?
[2022-12-10 09:50:46] <%Howkin_> dont seem like that many
[2022-12-10 09:50:48] <hubris_zero> Your animals are breeding like crazy.
[2022-12-10 09:50:56] <%Ljosapaldr> you're reaching what the df community is called 'fpsdeath' which is the threshold for when some people can't stand playing anymore due to slowed down game speed @Klean everyone has a different threshold, though
[2022-12-10 09:51:03] <jonah0_0> oh yeah and exterminating animals you dont need
[2022-12-10 09:51:28] <ithilious> Also I'd setup zones if you haven't. Especially for high traffic. Late game is about managing the lag, as when there's too much stuff it creates lag.
[2022-12-10 09:51:40] <%Ljosapaldr> @jonah0_0 this isn't true, it's an old community 'truth' that got tested recently, and pathfinding is just *not* a big part of fps slowdown
[2022-12-10 09:51:41] VIEWERS: 773
[2022-12-10 09:51:49] <ithilious> Same with blood/vomit. If you can clean that up real quick that helps with lag.
[2022-12-10 09:51:54] <%Ljosapaldr> the proof is on the bay12 forums, in a post by Putnam
[2022-12-10 09:51:55] <kornydogus1987> KILL ALL ANIMALS ON MAP lol lag solved
[2022-12-10 09:52:04] <TheDandyGuy> then you can do challenge runs and harder stuff too
[2022-12-10 09:52:10] <%Ljosapaldr> slowdown happens due to units and items, not pathfinding
[2022-12-10 09:52:14] <+jerbil_b> its all about that learning process for sure
[2022-12-10 09:52:14] <jonah0_0> @Ljosapaldr it helped with my fps death a year ago
[2022-12-10 09:52:18] <ithilious> Less fluids being simulated will also help reduce lag.
[2022-12-10 09:52:18] <+gotnukes> is it safe to say you addicted?
[2022-12-10 09:52:32] <+TheSoupNaz> do you have a lot of chicks or cats running around?

[2022-12-10 09:52:48] <+TheSoupNaz> killing them will fix that issue
[2022-12-10 09:52:52] <hubris_zero> Gotta clean up some of that trash. Find lava and dump your garbage into it.
[2022-12-10 09:52:54] <%Ljosapaldr> @jonah0_0 putnam tested the executive with memory hacking and talked with tarn, pathfinding isn't a big part of slowdown.
[2022-12-10 09:53:02] <ithilious> Could also reload the game. Should clear up a few frames.
[2022-12-10 09:53:12] <StarLordsSpaceYoga> Anyone know how fishing works when it shows carp 1 level below the surface? Can the dwarf get to it? I'm getting only mussels, but there's like fish 1 level below in the water
[2022-12-10 09:53:14] <Grinbale> making your own loadout for embark is also feels good
[2022-12-10 09:53:16] <cubes158> this fort is likely not anywhere near fps death, its not a massive embark, theres not a ton of units, probably somethind else going on
[2022-12-10 09:53:18] <%Ljosapaldr> Like that's hard evidence, everything else is how individuals felt in singular games they didn't do testing on
[2022-12-10 09:53:32] <%Ljosapaldr> fpsdeath is a personal threshold thing
[2022-12-10 09:53:38] <%Ljosapaldr> My tolerance is WAY higher than most

[2022-12-10 09:56:27] <%Ljosapaldr> which is why 'keep tightly closed' isn't in steamdf for doors
[2022-12-10 09:56:28] <+Zona221> You can do things to help with lag, atom smashing a bunch of items and killing tame animals for instance. There are set up's that are optimized. But at the end of the day the game is laughably complicated, and the simulation runs deep.
[2022-12-10 09:57:08] <+Zona221> You can get into things like Quantum Stockpiles

[2022-12-10 09:58:04] <+Zona221> I'm someone who plans out the entire fortress before I even un pause the embark so I feel that
[2022-12-10 09:58:39] <+jerbil_b> i feel like everyone has their own style to play the game lol
[2022-12-10 09:58:39] <TeslaKilledYou> Looks like rimworld on crack
[2022-12-10 09:58:44] <+TheSoupNaz> im glad you are enjoing this man!
[2022-12-10 09:58:47] <@%SamuraiSavv> Anyone play Prison Architect? I use the plan tool to make my entire prison before I start building it. KEKW Can't have that ugly random shape
[2022-12-10 09:58:50] <+TheSoupNaz> Thats so cool
[2022-12-10 09:58:53] <ithilious> When you go down the Dwarf Fortress rabbit hole, there is no escape. I've got at least 1k hours pre-steam.
[2022-12-10 09:58:57] <%Ljosapaldr> Designing in 3d is so much fun though. Have you even touched ramps yet?
[2022-12-10 09:58:57] <TheDandyGuy> I love watching :)
[2022-12-10 09:59:03] <+DragonReaver> Im playing whle watching KEKLEO
[2022-12-10 09:59:04] <+SquishWizard> how far can you zoom in?
[2022-12-10 09:59:13] <+jerbil_b> very chill to watch lol
[2022-12-10 09:59:17] <cubes158> klean another fun thing to do; consider that rooms don't have to be only 1 layer deep, you can remove floor and dig out stone to make giant rooms that are many z-layers deep
[2022-12-10 09:59:18] <thatrulegend27> are you ever going back to bannerlord btw?
[2022-12-10 09:59:23] <thatrulegend27> @Klean
[2022-12-10 09:59:27] <%ForsaikenRedskye> quit Tarkov forever seqChat
[2022-12-10 09:59:30] <%+impecabletimeing> great way to wrap up my birthday, some klean before bed
[2022-12-10 09:59:31] <+Zona221> If the huge wood and stone stockpiles bothers you then you can get around it with what's called quantum stockpiles. It involves abusing dumping zones
[2022-12-10 09:59:37] <%Howkin_> Tarkov is fun, but i play for 3 months then forget it excist for the other 9
[2022-12-10 09:59:38] <%+Niccoli00> yeah, doing stuff you enjoy is more entertaining than a tarkov slog once you get later into the wipe cycle

[2022-12-10 09:59:50] <%+Niccoli00> I subbed for tarkov, stayed for the rest

[2022-12-10 09:59:56] <%The_Bull> im glad you started streaming different games aswell you have put me onto many decent games

[2022-12-10 10:00:33] <%Ljosapaldr> yes
[2022-12-10 10:00:36] <ithilious> It's always great finding new games. I'm so glad they hit this release out of the park. It's still complicated for noobs, but the learning curve is way better than before.
[2022-12-10 10:00:37] <+moto187> how far in can you zoom on this bad boy
[2022-12-10 10:00:40] <kornydogus1987> yeah teach and eat and drink
[2022-12-10 10:00:41] <%Ljosapaldr> they meet and do demonstrations and hang out together
[2022-12-10 10:00:49] <%BerlinCB> What does it mean when dwarf names are flashing in your roster list?
[2022-12-10 10:00:50] <CornOnTheBrent> Dude this game looks totally different than the gameplay I remember seeing years ago. Completely different game
[2022-12-10 10:00:55] <TheDandyGuy> dwarf after school club
[2022-12-10 10:01:03] <%Howkin_> nah, they will get food themselfs
[2022-12-10 10:01:04] <ChemicalScum> You're discovering all these great games man, is only cool you share this
[2022-12-10 10:01:08] <%Ljosapaldr> you don't have to, but adding some stuff to it doesn't hurt

[2022-12-10 10:01:18] <%Howkin_> if you make backpacks they will carry food with em, and waterskins they will carry drink
[2022-12-10 10:01:27] <%+DeathByAutoTune> @klean honestly I was enjoying those bannerlord streams than I was your Tarkov streams. I love the variety of your channel
[2022-12-10 10:01:28] <hubris_zero> You might want to start a justice system to expose potential spies.
[2022-12-10 10:01:28] <TheDandyGuy> I think 20 years now
[2022-12-10 10:01:33] <kornydogus1987> 20 years +
[2022-12-10 10:01:34] <+SquishWizard> weird question, but how much can you zoom in?
[2022-12-10 10:01:36] <+Zona221> If you put a food stock by the guild they have to travel less to eat, otherwise they'll just grab it out of wherever you have it
[2022-12-10 10:01:40] <%Ljosapaldr> game started development in 2002 and was available to play since 2006
[2022-12-10 10:01:40] <ithilious> I'd honestly recommend trying the free version some day. Learning to play this game in Ascii is hilarious. It's like that one scene in the matrix.
[2022-12-10 10:01:43] <%Howkin_> first public realease was 2004 i think
[2022-12-10 10:01:43] <%+SiLoNoVa> 20 years in the making

[2022-12-10 10:01:53] <plastoid> burrow
[2022-12-10 10:02:14] <+TheSoupNaz> @Klean Tarn and Tody are looking to implement procedural generated magic they have these videos on it, its so fucking crazy
[2022-12-10 10:02:29] <+Zona221> Need plaster
[2022-12-10 10:02:33] <%Ljosapaldr> @plastoid Tarn and Toady is one person, Tarn *is* Toady
[2022-12-10 10:02:38] <%BerlinCB> Don't dwarves hate magic?
[2022-12-10 10:02:43] <+TheSoupNaz> yeah thats right lol
[2022-12-10 10:02:46] <+TheSoupNaz> i forgot
[2022-12-10 10:02:55] <plastoid> I know
[2022-12-10 10:02:56] <+Zona221> Tody and Threetoe
[2022-12-10 10:02:58] <ChemicalScum> the original dwarf fortress was a serious ascii rabit hole
[2022-12-10 10:03:01] <ithilious> A lot of people compare this to Rimworld, it's funny when people figure out this is the game that inspired Rimworld, it's got 20 years of development behind it, way more complex.
[2022-12-10 10:03:18] <%Ljosapaldr> @BerlinCB Shrugs, I know the game is called dwarf fortress, but like the game is actually not about dwarves in truth, it's a fantasy world simulator. Eventually you'll be able to randomly generate *everything* even your playable race.
[2022-12-10 10:03:19] <+Uranium_Bullet> Might finally look into Dwarf Fort with this high quality Steam remake/port thing. Dunno how people tolerated that ASCII art over the years -- looked like an eyesore.
[2022-12-10 10:03:39] <ithilious> I love this game in ascii, I hope someone makes an ascii mod for this so people can play with the original graphics
[2022-12-10 10:03:41] <%BerlinCB> I've heard "This is a Rimworld knockoff" several times this week.  Makes me laugh.
[2022-12-10 10:03:44] VIEWERS: 803
[2022-12-10 10:03:47] <%Ljosapaldr> ASCII runs on brain imagination, so it's not that hard when you have some of that
[2022-12-10 10:03:55] <plastoid> magic is for adventure mode more than fortress mode
[2022-12-10 10:04:03] <ithilious> @BerlinCB lol, oh my sweet summer children
[2022-12-10 10:04:06] <%Ljosapaldr> @ithilious don't need a mod, it's coming for free in a few weeks
[2022-12-10 10:04:16] <ithilious> YES!
[2022-12-10 10:04:29] <hubris_zero> Yeah, Tarn wants to add in a slider for how much fantasy is in your world. On the low scale, you'll get realistic worlds of humans and gods are only myths. On the high scale, every creature will be procedurally generated without any elves or dwarves.
[2022-12-10 10:04:31] <%Howkin_> @plastoid but having a goblin shaman casting armagedon on you do sound fun tho
[2022-12-10 10:04:32] <ithilious> Ascii coming to steam version, my life is complete
[2022-12-10 10:04:32] <%Ljosapaldr> tarn is literally working on classic mode right now, and classic is 100% free
[2022-12-10 10:05:05] <%ForsaikenRedskye> that's so metal bro headBang
[2022-12-10 10:05:07] <%Ljosapaldr> it's not coming to the steam version, it'll be the version downloadable for free on the website
[2022-12-10 10:05:11] <kornydogus1987> iron nice
[2022-12-10 10:05:14] <kornydogus1987> weps
[2022-12-10 10:05:16] <+TheSoupNaz> they will work on this game till they die
[2022-12-10 10:05:16] <%Ljosapaldr> and they're going to be maintained the same
[2022-12-10 10:05:21] <+TheSoupNaz> i dont ever see them stopping
[2022-12-10 10:05:28] <plastoid> ah silver
[2022-12-10 10:05:31] <%Howkin_> start making stone blocks? 1 stone =4 blocks and 10 block goes in bin, and each block count as stone for building constructions
[2022-12-10 10:05:34] <+Uranium_Bullet> Do the devs plan on smoothing out the animation of characters moving in the future instead of it being frame-by-frame? Or is this just a sped-up thing?
[2022-12-10 10:05:36] <ithilious> Seriously tho, glad this is doing as well as it is. They deserve the success, I know they only put this up on steam because of his rising medical bills.
[2022-12-10 10:05:38] <+pharasto> Oh that looks very clean. Good job so far!
[2022-12-10 10:05:43] <hubris_zero> Drinks are running a bit low.

[2022-12-10 10:06:04] <+TheGreatLuthais> what do you do with stone blocks?
[2022-12-10 10:06:18] <ithilious> Oh shit yeah, you've got a drink problem.

[2022-12-10 10:06:29] <plastoid> launch them with a catapult of course
[2022-12-10 10:06:31] <%Howkin_> @TheGreatLuthais you get 4 from 1 stone when crafted, and each one counts as a stone for building constructions
[2022-12-10 10:06:32] <+DragonReaver> Oh shit we need ale
[2022-12-10 10:06:36] <ithilious> What a legend

[2022-12-10 10:08:12] <+DragonReaver> Started at year 100
[2022-12-10 10:08:52] <%Ljosapaldr> @Klean the longest documented dwarf fort played by someone is 500 years btw
[2022-12-10 10:08:54] <kornydogus1987> nice means there will still b some legend creatures and such
[2022-12-10 10:09:01] <ithilious> probably would be good for more stills, you need more drank.
[2022-12-10 10:09:14] <hubris_zero> Maybe start the justice system.
[2022-12-10 10:09:16] <AmishHooker> some are just troublemakers LUL
[2022-12-10 10:09:17] <%BerlinCB> It's mostly kids that are pissed.  Fucking teenagers.  Kappa

[2022-12-10 10:09:24] <cubes158> you could just kill them
[2022-12-10 10:09:30] <hubris_zero> A bit of law will keep people in line.
[2022-12-10 10:09:31] <plastoid> I think they want toys
[2022-12-10 10:09:34] <%Ljosapaldr> Dwarves have wildly different personalities, some just won't ever be happy and you have to accept that, or banish them.

[2022-12-10 10:09:59] <ithilious> In my last fort a Dwarf Kid was up on 30 charges of disorderly conduct and vandalism.
[2022-12-10 10:10:00] <AmishHooker> one guy in my fort was constantly unhappy even though i made it my mission to please him. massive bedroom with everything high quality, still punched out my cook
[2022-12-10 10:10:05] <%BerlinCB> Wouldn't banishing start a ripple of displeasure from family, etc. @Ljosapaldr ?
[2022-12-10 10:10:05] <hubris_zero> Yeah, start a dungeon!
[2022-12-10 10:10:17] <+mlock42> @Ljosapaldr thats probably not true. just use google, was watching streamer that had vidoue of multiple 1000+ on youtube

[2022-12-10 10:10:21] <%KevinSredz> what are those squeaking sounds? is that just part of the ambience?
[2022-12-10 10:10:36] <plastoid> some dwarfs just wanna fight
[2022-12-10 10:10:44] <AmishHooker> it's the bird in the ambient sounds, its getting patched i heard LUL
[2022-12-10 10:10:44] <+pharasto> I think those should be bird sounds
[2022-12-10 10:10:51] <entrapta754> i heard rimworld copied this game
[2022-12-10 10:10:56] <StarLordsSpaceYoga> Jesus I have so much food. Never had this much food in DF.

[2022-12-10 10:11:30] <%BerlinCB> Yeah, that bird is hella annoying.

[2022-12-10 10:11:33] <AmishHooker> @entrapta754 i wouldn't say copy, dwarf fortress kinda shaped the way
[2022-12-10 10:11:36] <ithilious> @entrapta754 They didn't copy, it was inspired. Lots of games were inspired from DF, like Rimworld and Gnomoria. They are two very different games when you get down to brass tax.
[2022-12-10 10:11:39] <+DragonReaver> The bird screech ambient noise only happens on grassland

[2022-12-10 10:12:10] <+Skibat> only thing that could make rimworld better, is digging  like in dwarf fortress
[2022-12-10 10:12:12] <AmishHooker> rimworld is a gem though to be fair
[2022-12-10 10:12:18] <+DragonReaver> Yes
[2022-12-10 10:12:19] <cubes158> gnomoria was such a pleasure, shame it never got the depth that df has. it had a good UI
[2022-12-10 10:12:22] <ithilious> Are they scheduled to train?
[2022-12-10 10:12:25] <%Ljosapaldr> @Ljosapaldr Many people generate worlds that are 1000+, but I'm talking about a guy who played a single fort for 500 years straight
[2022-12-10 10:12:33] <kornydogus1987> garbage fire in comparison
[2022-12-10 10:12:42] <%BerlinCB> 500 years?  Daaaaamn.
[2022-12-10 10:12:47] <ithilious> @cubes158 Yeah dev dumped it. I played gnomoria b4 df, when he dumped it I picked up DF
[2022-12-10 10:13:29] <%Ljosapaldr> @cubes158 that guy has to realise how much he fucked up dropping it. If he'd kept it up he'd be sitting with a cult classic now.
[2022-12-10 10:13:35] <plastoid> terraria was inspired by df

[2022-12-10 10:14:03] <ithilious> Minecraft was inspired by df

[2022-12-10 10:14:08] <AmishHooker> @zakstahz if you settle close to them i think
[2022-12-10 10:14:24] <+0cu87> @zakstahz your fort's wealth dictates the size of sieges
[2022-12-10 10:14:28] <%Ljosapaldr> Like if you play wow, go to Menethil Harbour or whatever it's called in the Wetlands, the two dwarves outside the tavern are a DF reference.

[2022-12-10 10:16:21] <%Ljosapaldr> DF right now is missing the HUGE amount of AMAZING utility features the community made for this game, those are going to start rolling in around mid january
[2022-12-10 10:16:35] <%Ljosapaldr> When those hit? Holy shit DF goes from a 10 to a 12
[2022-12-10 10:16:43] <StarLordsSpaceYoga> We just mainly need Soundsense more than anything
[2022-12-10 10:17:06] <%ForsaikenRedskye> KKool BanjoTime
[2022-12-10 10:17:11] <ithilious> @Ljosapaldr Honestly I'll take my Dwarf Therapist over the current in game systems. Spread sheet is just easier to manage. Also auto clean from DF Hack, I miss that.
[2022-12-10 10:17:18] <%Ljosapaldr> Nah man I want my therapist. Vanilla labours work ok, but finding guys suited for special tasks is a pain.
[2022-12-10 10:17:34] <%Ljosapaldr> Do you want a brave strong dwarf for your military? Gl looking through 178 manually
[2022-12-10 10:17:45] <%Ljosapaldr> Or you could just tell DT "hey who's brave *and* strong" and be shown
[2022-12-10 10:17:50] VIEWERS: 771
[2022-12-10 10:18:00] <StarLordsSpaceYoga> Yea DF is nice, but LBH, those sounds are everything
[2022-12-10 10:18:05] <ithilious> Exactly, Dwarf Therapist is the goat.
[2022-12-10 10:18:19] <+pharasto> Just try anyone
[2022-12-10 10:18:24] <%Ljosapaldr> @Klean There's a utility for it called Dwarf Therapist that comes out around mid january
[2022-12-10 10:18:28] <kornydogus1987> just train em
[2022-12-10 10:18:29] <StarLordsSpaceYoga> It's software
[2022-12-10 10:18:33] <%Ljosapaldr> Yeah but it's not done for the new version
[2022-12-10 10:18:33] <+pharasto> Sometimes people optimize too much
[2022-12-10 10:18:35] <ithilious> It's a mod for the original. It's like a massive spread sheet.
[2022-12-10 10:18:36] <TheDandyGuy> utility for the original game
[2022-12-10 10:18:38] <%Howkin_> side running software
[2022-12-10 10:18:40] <+TheSoupNaz> Honest this labor system is really nice, it does shit that dwarf therapist does without us haveing to do the extra work
[2022-12-10 10:18:44] <ithilious> Makes the game way easier to manage
[2022-12-10 10:18:44] <%Ljosapaldr> It's community made and needs memory hacking and stuff.
[2022-12-10 10:18:58] <+TheSoupNaz> jobs are taking by the highest skilled dwarfs, you used to have to force that
[2022-12-10 10:18:59] <+pharasto> Think about it like this: Who is expendable? Put them in a squad
[2022-12-10 10:19:01] <%Ljosapaldr> @TheSoupNaz It absolutely does not, lol. It works, stuff gets done, but specializing anyone is painful.
[2022-12-10 10:19:02] <GrishnerF> im in love with the game but the menu cluttering/navigating is meh and burns my braincells.
[2022-12-10 10:19:05] <%ForsaikenRedskye> Pepega
[2022-12-10 10:19:16] <AmishHooker> @TheSoupNaz true. just wish there was a screen showing me the combat stats i need to see. we'll see improvements im sure
[2022-12-10 10:19:27] <ithilious> @GrishnerF Did you ever play the free version? xD
[2022-12-10 10:19:35] <ithilious> Waaaay worse.
[2022-12-10 10:19:48] <%ForsaikenRedskye> kleanSmokin
[2022-12-10 10:19:49] <%Ljosapaldr> Military, nobles, top crafters and such are way worse in current than with DT
[2022-12-10 10:19:50] <StarLordsSpaceYoga> Honestly the classic UI was great
[2022-12-10 10:19:50] <Lawi9> the legend of stalker ocarina of chernobyl Pog
[2022-12-10 10:19:51] VIEWERS: 771
[2022-12-10 10:20:03] <StarLordsSpaceYoga> Though there are some improvements here like being able to resize a stockpile easy
[2022-12-10 10:20:13] <ithilious> I had to unmemorize the 100+ hotkeys for the steam version. Wish they kept the old elevation hotkeys at least.
[2022-12-10 10:20:35] <%Ljosapaldr> I definitely played faster on the old UI too
[2022-12-10 10:20:45] <%Ljosapaldr> But most of what I'm missing is DFhack and DT
[2022-12-10 10:21:01] <StarLordsSpaceYoga> I just got 1 migrant. One. Usually DF is like "Here's 40"
[2022-12-10 10:21:01] <%krummy88> KKonaW Gett'm out
[2022-12-10 10:21:02] <ithilious> So much faster, takes awhile to unlearn 1k hours worth of game time for the new ui
[2022-12-10 10:21:08] <%Ljosapaldr> Like it's DFhack that added stuff like custom stockpile presets and being able to copy and paste them
[2022-12-10 10:21:23] <ithilious> Yeah DFHack is needed. Autoclean is the goat.
[2022-12-10 10:21:28] <%Ljosapaldr> @StarLordsSpaceYoga It's definitely slower, but Klean has gotten some 30+ waves
[2022-12-10 10:21:33] <+pharasto> Once you internalize the new hotkeys, you'll be faster again. Potentially faster than you ever were
[2022-12-10 10:21:46] <AmishHooker> ^
[2022-12-10 10:21:50] <%Ljosapaldr> @pharasto No because tons of hotkeys are missing, and can't be added back
[2022-12-10 10:21:51] VIEWERS: 771
[2022-12-10 10:21:56] <%Ljosapaldr> Like for workshops
[2022-12-10 10:22:02] <ithilious> Yeah I've gotten use to it, but at first I was like "wtf am I doing"
[2022-12-10 10:22:08] <AmishHooker> @Ljosapaldr mods my friend, we must be patient
[2022-12-10 10:22:24] <%Ljosapaldr> That's not mods, that's utilities, that's DFhack
[2022-12-10 10:22:27] <ithilious> So glad they added a workshop tho.
[2022-12-10 10:22:39] <%Ljosapaldr> mods in DF means rawedits, it's not like rimworld modding.
[2022-12-10 10:22:45] <+pharasto> But if you give up micromanaging the workshops directly, you might find that using work orders instead is much faster.
[2022-12-10 10:23:02] <ithilious> Do you have a water source? Are there Dwarfs tending to the animals?
[2022-12-10 10:23:26] <AmishHooker> @Ljosapaldr might be a thing of the past with workshop. i've seen old utilities on there but i could be wrong lol
[2022-12-10 10:23:30] <%Ljosapaldr> @pharasto 1. Work orders are better with dfhack too and 2. you need to get to them first, the first doors and stuff you make are super obnoxious.
[2022-12-10 10:23:52] VIEWERS: 787
[2022-12-10 10:24:01] <ithilious> I don't go that deep with DF hack.
[2022-12-10 10:24:10] <%Ljosapaldr> @Ljosapaldr No, I'm tuned in to this stuff. Workshop = raw edits. It's adding creatures, or changing them, adding items, different buildings etc. You can't change core stuff without DFhack.
[2022-12-10 10:24:42] <ithilious> I'd recommend building more stills
[2022-12-10 10:25:03] <%Ljosapaldr> Think about DFhack like Skyrim's SKSE
[2022-12-10 10:25:12] <%Ljosapaldr> You can't get SKSE on the workshop
[2022-12-10 10:25:38] <AmishHooker> @Ljosapaldr sterdePET  best way to put it
[2022-12-10 10:25:40] <lazypixell> @Klean Hi hows your life going?

[2022-12-10 10:26:03] <%Ljosapaldr> Klean is becoming a pro dorfer
[2022-12-10 10:26:42] <ithilious> Are they scheduled to train?
[2022-12-10 10:26:46] <lazypixell> @Klean Haven't seen you streaming EFT for quiet a while. How would you describe the game current state?
[2022-12-10 10:27:01] <%Ljosapaldr> @Klean I think they won't, you have them set on the 'train command', which I couldn't get to work, if you remove the command and give them a schedule instead it should work
[2022-12-10 10:27:15] <ithilious> Says off duty
[2022-12-10 10:27:51] <%Ljosapaldr> Whenever I used the direct train command they never trained, even if they had a schedule
[2022-12-10 10:27:54] VIEWERS: 796
[2022-12-10 10:28:00] <%Ljosapaldr> but if I removed it, they went straight to it
[2022-12-10 10:28:17] <ithilious> They've got to be scheduled to train in the squad menu, and in the assigned zone.

[2022-12-10 10:30:18] <ithilious> If they are of duty they wont train
[2022-12-10 10:31:14] <ithilious> Also make sure to reassign them to the barracks since you deleted the squads.

[2022-12-10 10:33:32] <ithilious> Is there a barracks up there? Could try only assigning them to it
[2022-12-10 10:33:32] <%Ljosapaldr> I think

[2022-12-10 10:34:06] <hubris_zero> Hey, I think the ballistas can only fire forward in a very narrow cone in the same z level.
[2022-12-10 10:34:19] <hubris_zero> So I don't think putting them on the roof will help.
[2022-12-10 10:34:24] <ithilious> Should be under ammo I think
[2022-12-10 10:34:30] <hubris_zero> You might need to put them in a tunnel.
[2022-12-10 10:34:40] <hubris_zero> Or construct a hallway.
[2022-12-10 10:34:50] <ithilious> Yeah ballista's are kinda wonky
[2022-12-10 10:34:58] <seriouscaller> under Furniture/siege ammo
[2022-12-10 10:35:16] <ithilious> Nothing funnier than when one takes out one of your own dwarfs rather than the enemy
[2022-12-10 10:35:42] <ithilious> Do you have a water source setup and people taking care of them?

[2022-12-10 10:36:22] <hubris_zero> The balistas are intended to be used in hallways. They can take out multiple enemies with one shot. However, they can only fire in a very narrow cone on the same z level. So putting on the roof wont work.
[2022-12-10 10:37:26] <%Ljosapaldr> are you making 2 per
[2022-12-10 10:37:53] <%Ljosapaldr> high boots are better it's not like you think
[2022-12-10 10:37:53] <Joshwahh> Tall boot might conflict with leg armor

[2022-12-10 10:38:26] <%Ljosapaldr> this is a plot
[2022-12-10 10:38:30] <hubris_zero> That's potentially a problem.
[2022-12-10 10:38:33] <%Ljosapaldr> this is what caused one of your forts to fail, this kind of plot
[2022-12-10 10:38:33] <ithilious> not cool, stoopid hoomans
[2022-12-10 10:39:03] <ithilious> That would do it xD
[2022-12-10 10:39:12] <%BerlinCB> Are those pets?
[2022-12-10 10:39:26] <ithilious> They could be pets
[2022-12-10 10:39:34] <%Ljosapaldr> DFhack could autoassign animals that need to graze to pastures
[2022-12-10 10:39:44] <hubris_zero> In Dwarf Fortress, villains can scheme and plot.
[2022-12-10 10:39:46] <%Ljosapaldr> as another example for why DF now is good, DF with utilities is amazing
[2022-12-10 10:39:58] VIEWERS: 779
[2022-12-10 10:40:02] <ithilious> Honestly tho, if you don't I'd setup like 2 dorfs and have them responsible for animal care. Also make sure you got a water source and buckets
[2022-12-10 10:40:16] <%BerlinCB> All of that should be available in a few months, yes @Ljosapaldr ?
[2022-12-10 10:40:17] <hubris_zero> Your dwarves revealing information about your artifacts might cause trouble.
[2022-12-10 10:40:17] <%krummy88> Can you kill all your dwarfs and just have humans?
[2022-12-10 10:40:27] <ithilious> @krummy88 No
[2022-12-10 10:40:35] <ithilious> Well you can mod in humans
[2022-12-10 10:40:47] <ithilious> But why would you? Dorfs > Hoomans
[2022-12-10 10:40:49] <%krummy88> oh
[2022-12-10 10:41:02] <%krummy88> dwarfs are short and stinky

[2022-12-10 10:41:21] <@%SamuraiSavv> Im experimenting
[2022-12-10 10:41:30] <%Ljosapaldr> @BerlinCB mid january is what the volunteers that make the community tools have said, it might run a bit over, depending on how patches go. Basically, right now they're figuring out what is different in steamdf, and then they will make 'memory presets', those memory presets is what allows the tools to work, and you need one for each patch since a patch always pushes some memory around.
[2022-12-10 10:41:46] <%Ljosapaldr> making humans playable is a super easy mod to make
[2022-12-10 10:41:50] <ithilious> Make some statues with the copper.

[2022-12-10 10:42:02] <ithilious> Yeah adveture mode you could play a bullman if you want.
[2022-12-10 10:42:07] <%Ljosapaldr> The dev isn't focusing on it, since eventually races will be able to be generated.
[2022-12-10 10:42:10] <talutz> in the adventure mode will you still be able to build fortresses etc.
[2022-12-10 10:42:20] <%BerlinCB> Fuuuuudge, I should sleep.  Klean's marathon streams are wearing me out as an old man.
[2022-12-10 10:42:21] <%BerlinCB> LUL
[2022-12-10 10:42:35] <hubris_zero> In adventure mode, you control a single person, or a small party of people.

[2022-12-10 10:42:48] <hubris_zero> It's different from fortress mode.
[2022-12-10 10:43:13] <%Ljosapaldr> If they can make adventuremode easier to play that'll be the real victory of steamdf, because I sucked at adventure mode
[2022-12-10 10:43:17] <GrandpaClamps> This music is too good

[2022-12-10 10:43:23] <ithilious> Yeah fortress mode is all bout the dorfs unless you mod it otherwise

[2022-12-10 10:47:14] <%Ljosapaldr> there was a funny bug, which I don't know is in steamdf, where if you sent a dwarvenmother out on a mission in a squad, she'd bring her baby, and the baby would get ambush skill
[2022-12-10 10:47:34] <%Ljosapaldr> @BerlinCB That's before you account for mods and updates, too
[2022-12-10 10:47:58] <GrandpaClamps> @Ljosapaldr she was probably hiding her baby in the bushes during the mission
[2022-12-10 10:47:59] <ithilious> I'd really recommend making a few more stills. One isn't enough to handle the population you have.

[2022-12-10 10:48:04] <icaros231> btw klean? excited for armored core? or u not a mecha guy?
[2022-12-10 10:48:37] <%Ljosapaldr> @GrandpaClamps Nah, dwarven mothers will use dwarven babies as shields. They never got coded to leave babies at home. This is why I just only make men soldiers, lol
[2022-12-10 10:49:01] <kornydogus1987> did u assign the beds??
[2022-12-10 10:49:13] <tyranosauros> This looks a million times more user-friendly than old dwarf fortress
[2022-12-10 10:49:24] <ithilious> @tyranosauros it is
[2022-12-10 10:49:47] <icaros231> i think that  may have to do with the speed the drinks are going down ... you may have the best tavern arround
[2022-12-10 10:50:00] <ithilious> I usually make small key bedrooms, like three units long.
[2022-12-10 10:50:00] <+Lee_of_Lyres> I went to bed when you embarked, just got up, and swallowedirons is looking good. Definitely addicted LUL. One of us, one of us.

[2022-12-10 10:51:14] <%BerlinCB> Hahaha.
[2022-12-10 10:51:49] <icaros231> @BerlinCB especially a dwarven one... those fucks are a quite sober bunch

[2022-12-10 10:52:51] <Prospekt_Mir> Mornin' Klean. How ya doin?
[2022-12-10 10:52:58] <ithilious> Make more stills. Your production isn't high enough for the amount of people you have.
[2022-12-10 10:53:07] <icaros231> @msterbaggins this is the game rimworld took as inspiration
[2022-12-10 10:53:10] <bl4cbe4r> this game is gooooold, but the most fun for me is in the end game, when you start playing with water flows, transfering energy, traprooms, magma forges,
[2022-12-10 10:53:14] <%BerlinCB> Rimworld is kind of like this @msterbaggins
[2022-12-10 10:53:25] <msterbaggins> @msterbaggins oh i had no idea thats really cool

[2022-12-10 10:54:18] <ithilious> Need at least 3 stills imo to keep a good stock of booze at this population.
[2022-12-10 10:54:42] <Prospekt_Mir> Oh shit I caught you 12 hours in - In a game I don't know shit about lol - What a soundtrack though
[2022-12-10 10:54:45] <bl4cbe4r> @Klean how do You enjoy first days of Dwarf Fortress?
[2022-12-10 10:55:03] <%BerlinCB> Is it bad that I'm looking forward to the collapse of civilization here?  Kappa
[2022-12-10 10:55:15] <+Lee_of_Lyres> limiting the still to only be used by trained people will increase production speed too
[2022-12-10 10:55:23] <ithilious> Collapse of civilization is inevitable xD
[2022-12-10 10:55:23] <icaros231> thats what we the hip kids call a chad klean
[2022-12-10 10:55:38] <+decku_> How many of these bards are Weregoats or similar :D
[2022-12-10 10:55:43] <%Paulbearier> bards, bards everywhere...
[2022-12-10 10:55:48] <ithilious> If you assign those entertainers to the taverns and temples, I think the petitions stop.
[2022-12-10 10:56:04] <icaros231> we are seeing our society just change the name of bard to streamer KEKW

[2022-12-10 10:57:33] <icaros231> it has yet to spiral out of controll and data seems kinda good the kurtosis of the mood distribution is on the positive side and there is a lot of stock of goodies (except drinks)
[2022-12-10 10:57:45] <talutz> are you playinmg with any mods?
[2022-12-10 10:57:54] <ithilious> I'd recommend creating a labor and assign 3 people to brewing

[2022-12-10 11:09:24] <ithilious> @CozyTime Original DF, 50 hours to get comfortable. Steam version about 5. I'd say for a new player the learning curve is about 12 hours now, maybe 50 until you fully learn the systems still tho

[2022-12-10 11:12:55] <ithilious> When that wereparrot contaminates half your base, you learn something. You are the accumulation of your failures, so don't be afraid to f up.

[2022-12-10 11:17:30] <ithilious> @thedominator1337 200 pop, usually having 20% as militia is good.
[2022-12-10 11:17:44] <hubris_zero> The holes are from the space left by cutting down trees.
[2022-12-10 11:18:00] <icaros231> @akimboyeo indeed, and i cant wait to see it happening xd
[2022-12-10 11:18:04] <hubris_zero> That's why people recommend you dig deeper before starting to build roomsl.

[2022-12-10 11:18:07] <ithilious> Honestly tho, small world 200 pop. Use a lesser pop or a pocket world if your computer sucks.
[2022-12-10 11:18:18] <%+akimboyeo> @icaros231 do you know if the game is always running in ironman mode or can you save scum?
[2022-12-10 11:18:39] <ithilious> Every game is a custom world, all that history = lag. So smaller worlds = less lag.
[2022-12-10 11:18:42] <n1ghtf4ll__> it shows where they spwned
[2022-12-10 11:18:46] <hubris_zero> It jumps to the start of the event.
[2022-12-10 11:18:50] <ithilious> Well you can reuse the same world
[2022-12-10 11:18:50] <icaros231> @akimboyeo i think he is ironmaning it , kleen is not big on save scumming
[2022-12-10 11:19:13] <icaros231> @ithilious the world is persistent , yeah you can

[2022-12-10 11:19:29] <%Ljosapaldr> so in old df it paused when these happened, so it showing where they spawn was fine, but because nothing pauses steam df, these notifications feel useless often
[2022-12-10 11:19:38] <ithilious> Yeah, sometimes it's good to make new worlds. As with all that history it gets laggy really quick

[2022-12-10 11:25:07] <Prospekt_Mir> This is so alien to me and looks like a Windows 95 game. I love it.
[2022-12-10 11:25:09] <ithilious> If you want to listen to a fun audio book @Klean I'd recommend looking up boatmurdered on youtube. It tells the tale of a succession fort, where different people take over a fort each year, it is wild.
[2022-12-10 11:25:25] <%Ljosapaldr> @n1ghtf4ll__ I got a weredeer, killed him. Checked for no bits. Missed a bite. Another turned next moon. Too much damage for me to figure out, so I just prayed. 2 new turned, and killed like 20 dwarves in the middle of the fort. They killed everyone around them, ran out of targets, and turned back to dwarves. I put them in a squad, told them to go into a room then locked it up with a wall. Then I started rebuilding. Later killed them by sending them on a suicide mission into my cave.
[2022-12-10 11:25:34] <icaros231> @ithilious or krugasmashh that dude has a linen like voice

[2022-12-10 11:40:16] <Holgast> when adventure mode is added though, you can visit settlements
[2022-12-10 11:40:16] VIEWERS: 837
[2022-12-10 11:40:17] <%Ljosapaldr> okay
[2022-12-10 11:40:23] <%Ljosapaldr> yes you can do that
[2022-12-10 11:40:25] <BoochBoocho> but not take over though just explore
[2022-12-10 11:40:30] <hadukenz> probably in adventure mode we cab visit other places
[2022-12-10 11:40:41] <%Ljosapaldr> you can do that RIGHT NOW, no adventure mode needed
[2022-12-10 11:40:49] <+Lee_of_Lyres> IIRC you can reclaim abandoned AI forts, but they suck
[2022-12-10 11:40:51] <%Ljosapaldr> wtf is that emote lol
[2022-12-10 11:41:07] <%Ljosapaldr> @Lee_of_Lyres he wants to see it, let him see it
[2022-12-10 11:42:05] <%Ljosapaldr> @Klean When you pick an embark spot, in the bottom right of the screen it will say 'Unretire/reclaim' this will let you play in forts you have retired yourself, or reclaim forts you OR the AI have lost in the world.
[2022-12-10 11:42:17] VIEWERS: 827
[2022-12-10 11:43:04] <%Ljosapaldr> This can lead to some pretty funny gameplay actually, depending on if what ended the fort is still there
[2022-12-10 11:43:49] <%GryphonM> yeah they should have custom embarks
[2022-12-10 11:43:56] <%GryphonM> havent tried it myself but there use to be
[2022-12-10 11:43:59] <%Ljosapaldr> Starting Scenarios are planned, but when they happen can be anywhere between a year to three, lol
[2022-12-10 11:44:01] <%GryphonM> in the old version
[2022-12-10 11:44:17] VIEWERS: 827
[2022-12-10 11:44:22] <%Ljosapaldr> That's one of the sucky and cool things about this game, it's never done, there's always more cool shit coming

[2022-12-10 11:45:09] <%Ljosapaldr> The way I see it, it just makes DF such a great investment learning. You'll be back here, again and again and again.
[2022-12-10 11:45:22] <%darcss> hello ppl
[2022-12-10 11:45:30] <markussuppe> it allready is a bit crazy
[2022-12-10 11:45:36] <Prospekt_Mir> Early access is just waiting on the devs to line their pockets, at least in terms of AAA - Indie is a whole different thing - It's a labor of love.
[2022-12-10 11:45:52] <%GryphonM> im proud of you klean , seem to have gottem the hang of it
[2022-12-10 11:45:54] <%Paulbearier> we need a woodchipper...
[2022-12-10 11:45:59] <%GryphonM> didnt take long KEKW
[2022-12-10 11:46:00] <%darcss> monkaW what is this game looks chaotic
[2022-12-10 11:46:05] <%Ljosapaldr> Like when you're streaming in 3 years and you feel done with some game and you go "hey what's new in dwarf fortress" and you just boot that shit up and make a week disappear
[2022-12-10 11:46:17] VIEWERS: 851
[2022-12-10 11:47:15] <%Ljosapaldr> yeah DF fits RIGHT in there

[2022-12-10 11:49:26] <%Ljosapaldr> Need to sell or gift your home 'country' stuff, then when you've made them enough money they'll promote you
[2022-12-10 11:49:27] <%GryphonM> @SamuraiSavv bass is not too much
[2022-12-10 11:49:59] <%Ljosapaldr> Eventually you can become the capital of your civilization
