[2022-12-20 10:02:55] <KimiruMaekumi> Long ago in a distant land, I, Aku, the shape-shifting Master of Darkness, unleashed an unspeakable evil! But a foolish Samurai warrior wielding a magic sword stepped forth to oppose me. Before the final blow was struck, I tore open a portal in time and flung him into the future, where my evil is law! Now the fool seeks to return to the past, and undo the future that is Aku!

Considering that I bought it on the 2nd, that should have had me good through the 2nd of January, right? However, the launcher was saying I only had 4 days left, so, thinking it was almost over, I bought a month. BUT, *that's* only lasting for the next 15 days. I. Am. Livid.]
