[2022-12-21 19:51:19] <Kamikaze17> potato dumplings are good in the fact that they can act as part of a varied number of meals, either with things in sauces or next to some steak and the like. Also funny how the Polish name can be translated to "hoovies" (dunno if other nearby countries have their own name for it)

[2022-12-21 19:57:20] <Melweddyn> Kopytka are potato dumplings. Pierogi can be filled with potatoes, so they are also potato dumplings. Which makes them potato dumplings, but they are not kopytka's. That's why we need weird names, to understand our weird food.

[2022-12-21 23:47:59] <%Beulena> vtol is a compromise for a problem created out of comprimise

[2022-12-21 23:48:53] <+Lufishshmebb> thats understandable swat, but the F-35B can also assert dominance over gravity via thrust rather than cringe aerodynamics and as such VTOL is good

[2022-12-21 23:49:31] <%LossyInput> "so what if we took the worst parts of a helicopter and a prop plane, then stuck 2 on either end of a fuselage?"
[2022-12-21 23:49:32] <%AceWindhover> i do not trust helicoptere
[2022-12-21 23:49:49] <%AceWindhover> or VTOLs
[2022-12-21 23:49:49] <@%Gibster99> A helicopter can still kinda make it to the ground but the Osprey can't I think
[2022-12-21 23:49:55] <cortallis> Large enough strip also means large enough strip for torpedos to lovingly land on your sides
[2022-12-21 23:49:58] <@%Gibster99> Unless it's a plane
[2022-12-21 23:50:21] <@%Gibster99> Not in a military though
[2022-12-21 23:50:25] <@%Gibster99> They're usually flying low
[2022-12-21 23:50:32] <@%Gibster99> So they have no time to react
[2022-12-21 23:50:44] <%b0x0d> what  was the jet that have machine gun that shot power is too strong, it make jet lose power?
[2022-12-21 23:50:48] <%b0x0d> A10?
[2022-12-21 23:50:52] <%tengyoyo> MONEY is the main concerned?
[2022-12-21 23:50:54] <%Beulena> the anti ship missile would like to know your location

[2022-12-21 23:51:10] <cortallis> I meanb 29 meters changes maneuverability considerably
[2022-12-21 23:51:10] <@%Gibster99> Cruiser I barely know her
[2022-12-21 23:51:19] <%+HighCaliberTree> cruiser volant?
[2022-12-21 23:51:20] <+Lufishshmebb> @Beulena Not a very good ASM then is it Kappa
[2022-12-21 23:51:24] <%+HighCaliberTree> sounds kinda wack
[2022-12-21 23:51:54] <%+HighCaliberTree> why would you integrate the french into anything
[2022-12-21 23:51:57] <%AceWindhover> volant was almost my name before Windhover musicmommyOMEGALUL
[2022-12-21 23:52:07] <%YouHaveCaptainDiabeetus> a fucking ramp
[2022-12-21 23:52:14] <+Lufishshmebb> reminder that the british carriers have the ability to be converted into CATOBAR
[2022-12-21 23:52:28] <%Beulena> @Beulena breh
[2022-12-21 23:52:32] <%b0x0d> A10 Jet was okay ish? i think
[2022-12-21 23:52:42] <%+Studibrudis> i would like the germans to have anything that works
[2022-12-21 23:52:43] <%YouHaveCaptainDiabeetus> @Lufishshmebb yeah and I'm the king of england
[2022-12-21 23:52:44] <+Lufishshmebb> LUL true swat true

[2022-12-21 23:53:27] <+Lufishshmebb> F-35B is VTOL therefore its a helicopter stop asking questions
[2022-12-21 23:53:30] <+Wocka_Fulf> F35B is the worst aircraft design ever.
[2022-12-21 23:54:03] <%Beulena> I'm telling you those footlongs will get you
[2022-12-21 23:54:06] <%LossyInput> the STOL variant is the best of both worlds

[2022-12-21 23:55:41] <+Wocka_Fulf> No marine pilots land on a carrier at night? Could've swore I read something about that.
[2022-12-21 23:56:04] <+Wocka_Fulf> Do**
[2022-12-21 23:56:05] <+Lufishshmebb> US Coast Guard Carriers and F-35's when?
[2022-12-21 23:56:11] <%+Killer_Alien1> musicmommyLurk
[2022-12-21 23:56:20] <%AceWindhover> they wanna replace everything with thr F-35, including A-10s

[2022-12-21 23:57:15] <+Lufishshmebb> Can't wait to see the B-52 at the retirement ceremony for the B-21 in 80 years Kappa
[2022-12-21 23:57:33] <%b0x0d> just in case WE NEED TO BUILD THE WALL AGAIN
[2022-12-21 23:57:35] <%LossyInput> haha funny big gun go BRRRRRRRRT
[2022-12-21 23:57:45] <GlitchyX6> It's a cult
[2022-12-21 23:57:49] <+Wocka_Fulf> F35 is supposed to replace it.
[2022-12-21 23:57:54] <+Lufishshmebb> the British would disagree about wanting support from the A-10 i think
[2022-12-21 23:57:55] <%Beulena> first to request predator drones, but then also to get it approved?
[2022-12-21 23:57:58] <+Wocka_Fulf> It's a strike fighter
[2022-12-21 23:58:09] <K1ller3nte> well, if you can hear it, it usually missed you
[2022-12-21 23:58:26] <!%NiteAssassin_> It‚Äôs almost having a 30 hour flight time would be nice to watch a large area of land and sea
[2022-12-21 23:58:28] <%AceWindhover> not just morale, but DEmoralizatiom of the enemy
[2022-12-21 23:58:43] <K1ller3nte> played enough HoI4 to say, CAS is fcking OP
[2022-12-21 23:58:47] <+Wocka_Fulf> 30mm is cheaper than a hell fire ;)

[2022-12-21 23:59:43] <GlitchyX6> Lazerpig's take on the A-10 was very informative
[2022-12-21 23:59:49] <%Beulena> bring back the 13 colonies amirite
[2022-12-21 23:59:59] <%AceWindhover> i wonder if thats the pilots fault or the TACPs fault
