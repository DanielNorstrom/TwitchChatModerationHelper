[2023-01-06 00:36:51] <dodgydaniel> how tall are you
[2023-01-06 00:36:53] <%iPRIxMAi> Depends. If you are playing reaper in low ranks - no. No skill. If you're playing at the highest levels and with a Winton - if you don't know how to play the game, you're throwing on reaper.

[2023-01-06 21:18:33] <@%vodka_n_tonic> @mysstle I used Gatorade for over twenty years. Then I found the miracle of Pedialyte. Doctor told me it's way more effective than Gatorade. He said Gatorade replaces electrolytes lost through sweat.
[2023-01-06 21:18:58] <DaBuckySir> pedialyte is so goated

[2023-01-06 21:58:34] <%GIRLinMaleBody> well he is reworking him
[2023-01-06 21:58:34] <%+thelastp0rg> What would you do to nerf Orisa? I think she really needs it
[2023-01-06 21:58:38] <chadhardt_> how to nerf orisa
[2023-01-06 21:58:38] <%GIRLinMaleBody> theyre*
[2023-01-06 21:58:39] <%+MorgothPlays> but then I have to play orisa against hog and that's not fun :D
[2023-01-06 21:58:40] <LOOKupMS> it's blizzard they do that everytime
[2023-01-06 21:58:42] <generalvonroom> if orisa is weak then road will dominate again
[2023-01-06 21:58:42] <%TehMercenary> or that's the only tank we'll se in OWL/WC
[2023-01-06 21:58:43] <abxc3> hog makes enemy sojourn way more powerful because you cant insta charge rail from hog
[2023-01-06 21:58:48] <%+MorgothPlays> @generalvonroom this
[2023-01-06 21:58:48] <%+xbands1ips> sojourn also needs nerfs
[2023-01-06 21:58:49] <%thelaziest78> they should nerf genji
[2023-01-06 21:58:58] <%GIRLinMaleBody> @abxc3 ball too
[2023-01-06 21:59:00] <Steamblox> they really need to do something about fortify
[2023-01-06 21:59:00] <homelesswithoutthem> They both should get nerfed
[2023-01-06 21:59:05] <%Texasisgone> I personally didn't think Orisa needed a buff to begin with (other than the ult change)
[2023-01-06 21:59:08] <%GIRLinMaleBody> nerf mercy too
[2023-01-06 21:59:25] <%+xbands1ips> reinhardt should be way stronger than c tier
[2023-01-06 21:59:26] <abxc3> @GIRLinMaleBody ball cant be headshot which gives more charge also ball is moving too fast for projectile
[2023-01-06 21:59:33] <ashley_yea> blizzard is like 3 months late to any balance patches
[2023-01-06 21:59:36] <wasted_thymes> also true, glad someone is saying this
[2023-01-06 21:59:41] <soeholttt> How was orisa in ow1?
[2023-01-06 21:59:44] <%+xbands1ips> hog counters rein too though
[2023-01-06 21:59:47] <%+xbands1ips> he hooks your charge
[2023-01-06 21:59:47] <%GIRLinMaleBody> @abxc3 I played with ball and he was hard feeding sj

[2023-01-06 22:02:41] <chomkyseal> @GIRLinMaleBody oh i know, i just personally think it's a terrible hero design to make a tank which is all about one shot combos and making space by the threat of a 1 shot

[2023-01-06 23:11:55] <@^Nightbot> My favorite streamer is LHChair. he is very dark, has great lumbar support, and honestly he carries the stream when Cloudy is gone. He comes equipped with a very powerful height adjusting lever that’s perfect for our favorite streamer. LHChair doesn’t interact much so it’s really helps when chat can make their own content
