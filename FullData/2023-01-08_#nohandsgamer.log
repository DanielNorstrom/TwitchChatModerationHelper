[2023-01-08 02:31:51] <portugues01> next expansion they rotate out "hero card, colossals , locations" ??? @NoHandsGamer
[2023-01-08 02:32:03] <+piecell> If it weren't for quest mage, UiS was fine

[2023-01-08 02:32:55] <EffOne_> Locations dont rotate do they?

[2023-01-08 02:33:02] <Fawzi412> @portugues01 they rotate the oldest 3 sets, so hero cards and quests
[2023-01-08 02:33:05] <Zaxlor> Getting too old for this shit Sadge
[2023-01-08 02:33:10] <Akaryn87> i wonder how much Games it takes until he goes back to egg priest

[2023-01-08 02:33:16] <Zaxlor> And he had only 4 more days left on the job! PepeHands
[2023-01-08 02:33:25] <!%pocket_train> UiS was the best expansion. it was the one that got Illucia nerfed
[2023-01-08 02:33:53] <JakeTheDoggo_> OTK warlock with quest @cabstero
[2023-01-08 02:34:12] <atreidestft> readhands gamer

[2023-01-08 02:34:52] <Akaryn87> i always try to read the hands from the 90% of thief rogues I’m playing. But the pool is a bit big Kappa
[2023-01-08 02:35:09] <EffOne_> Ilucia ruined my favorite deck ever which was the alextrasza tenwu rogue, so fun
[2023-01-08 02:35:21] <!%pocket_train> Scholo was maybe just the best expansion
[2023-01-08 02:35:24] <%vayazu2> on that we can agree
[2023-01-08 02:35:33] <Sjow> this meta is perfect
[2023-01-08 02:35:35] <+0ddler_> they should unnerf illucia wild can handle it

[2023-01-08 02:36:50] <Sjow> its only natural to have 50% winrate in mirror
[2023-01-08 02:36:56] <Zaxlor> @CS_Apples I think it was hotfixes for mobile
[2023-01-08 02:37:11] <+piecell> I kinda like at least that the timing of this meta worked out that we have to wait a couple weeks for changes
[2023-01-08 02:37:20] <!%pocket_train> I played vs someone 6 times today who did this to me every time

[2023-01-08 02:46:55] <%Lvl_100_Magikarp> it’s annoying that you can queue a hard control deck that goes even with miracle just to instalose to thief
[2023-01-08 02:46:58] <cassetto> thief is funnier!!!
[2023-01-08 02:47:02] <+piecell> people love playing random win cons
[2023-01-08 02:47:03] <%+djigo> @FroggyFiesta Thanks for the gift sub!

[2023-01-08 02:47:11] <+GhostLoads> Is this at top .5% or throughout al ranks
[2023-01-08 02:47:16] <+piecell> they feel like they're scamming the oppenent which hits that dopamine
[2023-01-08 02:47:29] <!%pocket_train> Warrior isn't even favoured vs Miracle, don't think it's worth adjusting for it
[2023-01-08 02:47:52] <+piecell> it's exactly that
[2023-01-08 02:47:56] <+piecell> people love value
[2023-01-08 02:48:03] <+irpro_cs> thief is value tempo kinnda

[2023-01-08 02:48:11] <+piecell> even tho it's like tier 4
[2023-01-08 02:48:37] <%vayazu2> without either one the game would die

[2023-01-08 02:48:41] <!%pocket_train> you're gonna hate me for this but I think it's because value decks are much easier
[2023-01-08 02:48:47] <+jimboss2121> <--- am efficiency psychopath, can confirm we exist
[2023-01-08 02:48:50] <Sjow> like we doing now :)

[2023-01-08 02:49:08] <gymmaxxing> i see so many miracle rogues missplay at top 500
[2023-01-08 02:49:11] <gymmaxxing> i'd say thats why
[2023-01-08 02:49:21] <%+Mr_M0jo> all you need are Astalors
[2023-01-08 02:49:24] <Inn0x> What does mechanically mean in a game like HS?
[2023-01-08 02:49:33] <%jobraz27> More options give a bigger skillcap, but its more forgivable
[2023-01-08 02:49:55] <+0ddler_> naga priest was a very mechanical deck
[2023-01-08 02:50:02] <RiseWasHereHS> spell naga spell naga
[2023-01-08 02:50:11] <%raflesh0001> aggro harder than control change my mind
[2023-01-08 02:50:38] VIEWERS: 564
[2023-01-08 02:50:38] <%jobraz27> @raflesh0001 its way more complicated than that, but youre technically not wrong
[2023-01-08 02:50:51] <%Lvl_100_Magikarp> it’s like people who like FPS vs people who like chess
[2023-01-08 02:50:54] <Zaxlor> @raflesh0001 I love playing Agro, but the only "hard" thing about it knowing when to trade/knowing when the OPPONENT has to trade
[2023-01-08 02:51:02] <!%pocket_train> Yeah I get that, I loved Mozaki Mage because I queued no mirrors ever
[2023-01-08 02:51:19] <%+Senshiwuafu> low skills = pirates rouge
[2023-01-08 02:51:27] <%jobraz27> @zaxlor way harder to onow when to not overcommit
[2023-01-08 02:51:30] <%vayazu2> sometimes you see known control players tryhard for high finishes with aggro decks
[2023-01-08 02:51:38] <gymmaxxing> i just jackpot on 2
[2023-01-08 02:51:51] <%+Sammikk> pirate wear makeup? @Senshiwuafu
[2023-01-08 02:52:00] <Zaxlor> @jobraz27 That just needs knowledge of the opponents deck, surely? I mean, Control litterally can't "overcommit" because it plays removal and not minions :P
[2023-01-08 02:52:02] <Jimmy_Page_> lol

[2023-01-08 02:52:45] <+0ddler_> there are different skills in hearthstone, such as deck building. it's harder to make control decks
[2023-01-08 02:52:50] <Sjow> rogues are legend already
[2023-01-08 02:52:53] <%+Senshiwuafu> @sammikk in wild
[2023-01-08 02:52:58] <%vayazu2> in general playing the beatdown role is more complex than the control role in a matchup
[2023-01-08 02:53:01] <%jobraz27> @zaxlor You said :"the only hard thing is to know when to trade with aggro", im just saying I think its harder to not overcommit with aggro lol

[2023-01-08 02:54:36] <Zaxlor> @jobraz27 Yeh it's a tough skill to count if you've got lethal in hand/on board/in deck. I think Agro has to play to it's outs more than control needs to play to it's removal
[2023-01-08 02:54:38] VIEWERS: 589
[2023-01-08 02:54:43] <JakeTheDoggo_> They just didn't pick Astalor because it would've been way too easy Keepo

[2023-01-08 02:56:07] <xaybaybay> is Ramp good again or just for fun? :D
[2023-01-08 02:56:17] <%jobraz27> @zaxlor control v aggro is way easier to manuver with control, but control vs control MU have a "chess game" kinda vibe to them.. which is why people say it has a higher skillcap, but yeah aggro is not as simple as bad control players want tou to believe
[2023-01-08 02:56:31] <%rexmkh> good means good Kappa

[2023-01-08 02:58:45] <%jobraz27> @zaxlor hahaha yeah discover mecanics made it harder to play around stuff thats for sure.. now its more of a:"play around the odds of them having it" instead.. which is harder on the mind bc its harder to tell if you played correctly or not
[2023-01-08 02:58:52] <xaybaybay> I'm pretty sure Kibler is the shadow balance team
[2023-01-08 02:58:57] <cabstero> brian "brian kibler" kibler
[2023-01-08 02:59:02] <xaybaybay> He speaks and it happens
[2023-01-08 02:59:03] <TraetzkY> Hi bronze gamer <3
[2023-01-08 02:59:09] <bitbangboom> will it be gnoll or really just maestra
[2023-01-08 02:59:17] <bmkibler> True.
[2023-01-08 02:59:25] <Fudov> i really hope its prep

[2023-01-08 02:59:44] <patrikk808> just tell it was a bug and they dont have to give back dust for maestra
[2023-01-08 02:59:44] <+0ddler_> idk how they nerf maestra, they probably just do the easy route and nerf gnoll mana cost
[2023-01-08 02:59:45] <%+Senshiwuafu> reno?
[2023-01-08 02:59:47] <+Sj315> Kibler
[2023-01-08 02:59:58] <RamBo2307> @0ddler_ I am going to be pissed i want my dust
[2023-01-08 03:00:02] <%+ucdchris1> the trade off is technically the bad card, and sometimes u have to do nothing turns 1/2 right
[2023-01-08 03:00:04] <xaybaybay> you may not draw it :)
[2023-01-08 03:00:05] <%vayazu2> is 1 mana nerf even enough or do you need 2
[2023-01-08 03:00:07] <gymmaxxing> would you unnerf renathal
[2023-01-08 03:00:13] <+0ddler_> I would want them to nerf maestra
[2023-01-08 03:00:14] <%rexmkh> you tradeoff having an average winrate for having a t1 deck winrate Kappa
[2023-01-08 03:00:24] <Sjow> problem is rogue is gonna be op anyway even with just gnoll nerf
[2023-01-08 03:00:26] <+piecell> Yeah like prep is useless or inefficient in lots of scenarios
[2023-01-08 03:00:32] <Sjow> even tho i agree 100 % gnoll is a problem
[2023-01-08 03:00:33] <+piecell> It’s not overpowered
[2023-01-08 03:00:35] <kleinesbier> i play my cutlass reduced potion belt on 2 for 1 mana that's pretty suboptimal
[2023-01-08 03:00:38] VIEWERS: 810
[2023-01-08 03:00:39] <kleinesbier> :)
[2023-01-08 03:00:45] <bitbangboom> Kibler has it right when gnoll works fine w/o the maestra interaction
[2023-01-08 03:00:50] <+piecell> @sjow I disagree that it’ll be broken post gnoll nerf
[2023-01-08 03:00:51] <JakeTheDoggo_> belt to 3 mana?
[2023-01-08 03:01:04] <+piecell> Aggro will become favored
[2023-01-08 03:01:05] <xaybaybay> Warrior games take too long
[2023-01-08 03:01:06] <ZBD502> they ran out of ideas for good warrior cards
[2023-01-08 03:01:11] <%vayazu2> i cannot excuse the warrior final design yeah
[2023-01-08 03:01:12] <ShellBasher1> Thats because rogue identity is to cheat mana
[2023-01-08 03:01:14] <kleinesbier> look at shaman PogChamp

[2023-01-08 03:35:25] <+abobo45> it's supposed to be in theme with the lich king color scheme

[2023-01-08 03:35:39] <+abobo45> and next xpac signature cards will have a color scheme that fits them

[2023-01-08 03:37:12] <@^Nightbot> NoHands is able to click with NaturalPoint's SmartNav and DwellClick. SmartNav tracks the movement of his head via a dot on his glasses, and if he focuses on one point for a little bit the DwellClick software clicks the mouse. OR he could be using his foot petal to click while eye tracking moves the mouse :) Here's an interview of him: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz8K3yAOat8
