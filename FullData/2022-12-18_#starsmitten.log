[2022-12-18 01:02:05] <%ManiaFreak> aram - anything but most fun when it works being bruisers/adcs
[2022-12-18 01:02:35] <%ManiaFreak> ARURF - same thing if its pick urf i try new things till i get fed up with seeing same champs then i spam MF and kaisa
[2022-12-18 01:03:23] <@%SpikeLuk> Sussy
[2022-12-18 01:03:26] <%ManiaFreak> Rift - i am a support main lol so try to shy away from them in the other modes
[2022-12-18 01:04:25] <@%SpikeLuk> ok you're safe celiNoted when you said you don't like exhaust I assumed you played something cringe like katarina or something

[2022-12-18 01:10:56] <@%SpikeLuk> @SpikeLuk i think any overtime damage mages like that it's a lottery if you have like 10 kills in 20 minutes or 0 lmao
[2022-12-18 01:11:09] <@%SpikeLuk> depends on how lucky you are with the damage ticks
