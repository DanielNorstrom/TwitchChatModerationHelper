[2022-12-31 00:59:28] <its_matija> ngl i wish a could have a gun but im also happy that nobody can have them (i live in germany)
[2022-12-31 00:59:29] <junkfarmer> the U.S. is still a fairly new country, not that long ago it was all frontier and you had to self govern
[2022-12-31 00:59:34] <+trev24> i live 5 minutes from a 1000 acre private access outdoor range and id trade it for nothing
[2022-12-31 00:59:35] <%frisbeman> sorry I can't watch more consistently during your drops event, having a 6 week year old plus being around family makes it tough haha but I'm glad youre having a good stream and getting a lot of views!
[2022-12-31 00:59:42] <%frisbeman> you deserve it
[2022-12-31 00:59:52] <loginlava> I need arena
[2022-12-31 00:59:54] <%markkess12> @Klean i think you enjoy wipes more
[2022-12-31 00:59:55] <TeraCeltica> I miss battle bits already
[2022-12-31 00:59:57] <+OG_Patrick97> just got a SA58 and damn i need to get an optic these aperture sights suck
[2022-12-31 01:00:09] <viperwolfpanda> I really want to get my first gun next year.
[2022-12-31 01:00:10] <be9ns> to you what is "late wipe"? to me its like month and a half and it seems stale unfortunately
[2022-12-31 01:00:12] <%lord_ubah> I already miss the 8 hour DF streams. Good thing DF will be around forever.
[2022-12-31 01:00:24] <+SkyW0rmJames> Off to a really bad start this wipe, not sure what ii'm doing wrong this is like wipe number 5 for me hope my luck turns around
[2022-12-31 01:00:32] <AvengingProphet> @trev24 Well... I have nothing  Kappa
[2022-12-31 01:00:49] <be9ns> yea same same
[2022-12-31 01:00:59] <angeldust1992> in switzerland we have a lot of guns at home. i like guns
[2022-12-31 01:01:04] <its_matija> @Klean i heard you talking about how unrealistic recoil in tarkov is and i was wondering if you could explain what actual recoil feels like and how it would work in game
[2022-12-31 01:01:09] <LabMade> it will be huge, hopeful its soon
[2022-12-31 01:01:12] <+KC_GingerSnapz> that will be nice man
[2022-12-31 01:01:15] <guessillgrowup> yeah dude, i can’t wait for arena
[2022-12-31 01:01:15] <+Hazonku> Me too. I'm a filthy casual who doesn't have the time to no life EFT anymore.

[2022-12-31 01:02:44] <+Hazonku> @DeltaSixtyEight Yeppers. For all the PVP chads & filthy casuals.
[2022-12-31 01:02:57] <DeltaSixtyEight> OK thanks
[2022-12-31 01:03:14] <+GuidoDaKilrPimp> my biggest barrier to close quarters pvp was that i wasnt good at it and it was just a waste of gear trying to learn
[2022-12-31 01:03:21] <+GuidoDaKilrPimp> so arena would actually fix that

[2022-12-31 01:04:52] <+itsLean> chat, can you learn this game on the fly or do you need to spend time watching youtubes
[2022-12-31 01:04:52] <%+elmate715> It's randomized
[2022-12-31 01:04:55] <%+elmate715> think
[2022-12-31 01:05:06] <Jedisssss> more dynamic things would spice tha game a little
[2022-12-31 01:05:08] <%PinkGuy_120> arent those items placed "randomly" now? think so ye
[2022-12-31 01:05:11] <its_matija> @huddycs i didnt even know u can change clothing on ur pmc (been playing for 2 wipes btw)
[2022-12-31 01:05:21] <%PepeSilvia__> @itsLean you have to play to learn
[2022-12-31 01:05:24] <%+InKaHoOtS> i like how you can still fully shut a door after kicking it in

[2022-12-31 01:07:41] <p_jilla> @itsLean it is alot but i dont remember feeling too overwhelmed. just watch some beginner guides to learn the basics then play then before bed when relaxing watch some letsplays or something just theres so much content and im still learning shit after 1300 hours
[2022-12-31 01:07:55] <buggzymalones> @p_jilla it is a lot of info. This game has an incredibly steep learning curve. The way I learned was doing this though. Watching streams of people who are experienced and asking quesitons
[2022-12-31 01:08:33] <%+InKaHoOtS> having a map up is good too so you learn locations. also using your scav as a double way to learn a map helped me a ton

[2022-12-31 01:19:59] <%ForsaikenRedskye> @Skullii mushrooms and THC bro... both are very good for you. i still feel like i'm 23.
[2022-12-31 01:20:02] <+Broku92> @Broku92 yes, but they didnt balance the recoil across all guns so certain smgs have higher recoil than rifles. You can have balanced gunplay without going COD style gameplay, squad does it well.
[2022-12-31 01:20:07] <Maniac187> @trev24 the weapon name is on the top right

[2022-12-31 01:43:38] <%+mahhndo> Yea its peak west coast time rn
[2022-12-31 01:43:43] <+Stromguard> Do streamers get whitelisted for quicker queue times?
[2022-12-31 01:43:43] <DeltaSixtyEight> @Mrshilka whats a queue? Kappa
[2022-12-31 01:43:47] <%Omboom> by far the best wipe in years as far as queue time
[2022-12-31 01:43:48] <+Zezzku> I've only had 1 raid that was worse than the others, we as a 3 man had some weird server lag going on
[2022-12-31 01:43:50] <%+jedy357> Scavs on EU are 10+ mins
[2022-12-31 01:43:55] <Adirzone> i cant even get into scav games lmao
[2022-12-31 01:43:55] <+Zezzku> other than that its been fine
[2022-12-31 01:43:57] <BSDilly> In EU you'll wait over 15 mins for scav or 5+ for pmc
[2022-12-31 01:43:58] <p_jilla> scavs is mainly what i struggle getting into. like 7 mins
[2022-12-31 01:44:00] <Penaleve> this is the most stable wipe i've played tbh, server wise at least FeelsGoodMan
[2022-12-31 01:44:04] <%+InKaHoOtS> yea this was a pretty smooth wipe to start compared to others by far
[2022-12-31 01:44:11] <weebwack3r> I agree 100%. Hardly any matching times unless ur scaving. Streets FPS is way better than any other fresh map. Rubberbanding is the only big issue
[2022-12-31 01:44:15] <BSDilly> Not at all
[2022-12-31 01:44:17] <@%Mrshilka> stability def
[2022-12-31 01:44:18] <+buffalotrucker> Scav's have been no shorter than 8 minutes for me. PMC raids have been around 5 minutes after selecting all NA servers instead of "Auto". I'd recommend it.
[2022-12-31 01:44:21] <@%dabsNbrews> we got into streets last night with like a 7 min queue. not bad at all
[2022-12-31 01:44:26] <%+whomst_d_ve_ly_yaint_nt> im in europe and i hase about 4 min to wait on pmc and 12 min for scav
[2022-12-31 01:44:26] <%+zaccray> my queue times have been really bad
[2022-12-31 01:44:37] <+PsychodelicSalad> Yeah agreed, hit reg feels pretty good too I've been enjoying it man
[2022-12-31 01:44:48] <+Squawceefin> im looking at 10-15 mins every raid
[2022-12-31 01:44:50] <%+zaccray> for scav at least, pmc has been really good
[2022-12-31 01:44:54] <+jayohfive> @buffalotrucker what maps you scavving?
[2022-12-31 01:45:01] <@%Mrshilka> if you got long raid times check out server settings
[2022-12-31 01:45:01] <+g4mercole> Yo whats up
[2022-12-31 01:45:07] <@%Mrshilka> you might have them really limited
[2022-12-31 01:45:14] <BSDilly> FPS is pretty bad, queing in EU is terrible and there is serious server stability issues on streets, lighthouse launch was better than this lol

[2022-12-31 01:59:16] <+LiyonOfEarth> I know there were already some sus issues with the steam audio. However, this new audio, cut my frames in half and was causing stutters and straight up freezes. Hopefully the hot fix you mentioned helps but BSG don't have a great track record of fixing an issue the first time around, so that makes me concerned of this road we are on now.

[2022-12-31 13:35:58] <Penaleve> but only  fully implemented on some
[2022-12-31 13:36:18] <NeLZi94> they buff the scavs on this wipe, they have soo much accuracy and faster reaction time and i think is too much for them

[2022-12-31 13:57:39] <stellarb> Is Streets the most detailed FPS map ever created?
[2022-12-31 13:57:41] <Penaleve> but now streets is basically a giant shoreline resort, so it should become obsolete this patch i figure
[2022-12-31 13:58:07] <buddhacheesa> @Klean Question my dude. Do you like map Streets? And is your performance any good on that map? Congrats with the 6 years btw!

[2022-12-31 15:10:11] <+aflyingcone_> I want to go to sleep but when I get off tarkov to chill I watch you play and then I wanna get back on tarkov KEKW its a viscous cycle
[2022-12-31 15:10:12] <saf3ty1st> some streamers say 24hrs but half of time they are not there.
[2022-12-31 15:10:28] <+itsdeefree> i had a wodnerful and also horrible time on shrooms last week, i think in moderation maybe 1 time a year it can be beneficial
[2022-12-31 15:10:31] <forevercsH> ive prob died like 30 raids in a row

[2022-12-31 15:13:00] <+Lesterr420> prolly just desync and not actually cheaters
[2022-12-31 15:13:00] <FinalFawn> Yea
[2022-12-31 15:13:09] <+HEAVY_PLEASURE> Same on southeast

[2022-12-31 15:13:31] <eolanp> I personally think cheaters can see your name so they avoid streamers a tiny bit (and attack specific ones of course too)
[2022-12-31 15:13:33] <bergax23> i had today the d-sync thing

[2022-12-31 15:13:42] <+FrenZyKiLLa> I've been getting mad queue times, like even on factory/customs. Scav and PMC queue times over 15+ minutes.
[2022-12-31 15:13:54] <%PinkGuy_120> @picklemickkk probably wasn't even asked LUL
[2022-12-31 15:13:56] <eolanp> i also notice if you look at ground and wiggle they sometimes leave you alone,

[2022-12-31 15:14:02] <%DeathlokTheDemolisher> Are you sure its cheaters or sniper scav on streets! LUL

[2022-12-31 15:14:04] <vinni_winchester> at the end of the day you report them and move on you may never know fo sure

[2022-12-31 15:14:19] <eolanp> when i had a super high kd they left me alone alot too so i never saw em
[2022-12-31 15:14:20] <FiF0_tv> @FrenZyKiLLa manually pick servers instead, worked for me

[2022-12-31 16:32:51] <+Yawger> Klean, Thoughts on Scav timer gradually dropping during the length of the wipe cycle. I.E. 1 mos = <1min ... Which would allow newer players, players who perhaps cant play as much, a chance to catch up on Scav runs and get more money/gear to supply their loadouts as the wipe continues. I hope that made sense. LOL
[2022-12-31 16:32:54] <SPOONSVK73> I found a really bad glitch I was using used IFAK and got a scav popping out so I clicked on mouse to pull out a gun and simultaneously panic clicked to change the gun and my character got stuck

[2022-12-31 16:40:46] <%PinkGuy_120> Arena release date is more plausible tbh, don't think they'd release it this early into the wipe
[2022-12-31 16:40:51] <%wubnoxious> I would def leave work to play arena
[2022-12-31 16:40:59] <+rawfrog_> Looks similar to Contract Wars “Hired Ops”

[2022-12-31 17:00:21] <+RealDesertWild> @MagzTheScavKing Or it wasn't an accident... O_o
[2022-12-31 17:00:23] <MagzTheScavKing> I just finished a scav run where the raiders just couldn't hit me and didn't even try to fight. Killed 6 of them on an open field XD
[2022-12-31 17:00:26] <hypoxic_za> @MooCowHeal If you get no xp it's 10mins. If you get kills and do some looting it's less.

[2022-12-31 17:06:41] <ApexAiry> I think the only problem is when you are the user of the flashslight it makes this way too white and hard to see at times
[2022-12-31 17:06:44] <+BAMTHEBA57ARD> watched 5hours of streams and it says 75% of 2 hours fuck

[2022-12-31 17:07:35] <+NeuronBasher> Even 500 lumens in the face is very distracting. Even the TLR-7A on a pistol is super effective.

[2022-12-31 17:40:34] <+Official__Crusader> @Ripper203 If the round is faster than sound, you're not going to hear the snap the same time the bullet hits. It will be slightly delayed. Unless if you're talkin about them not hearing the snaps
[2022-12-31 17:40:34] <@%Ripper203> Find boolets dirty scav man

[2022-12-31 17:40:41] <tocSicle> @Official__Crusader Yes you hear the crack after the bullet strikes on shots unless subsonic and those can be supressed

[2022-12-31 17:53:22] <%+karlis121> @PointmanPac because they all think that gpu is the only thing you need
[2022-12-31 17:53:22] <%+Bl4ck_B1rd_> @smokin_hydro assuming your CPU is a 12700k and not a 2700k KEKW, then your RAM is not the problem. Prolly something faulty in your OS
[2022-12-31 17:53:28] <Dulius6> @Dulius6 Nah Nah that would be the French PMC's, They never made it to Tarkov
[2022-12-31 17:53:32] <BenjiFactor> Factory sounds lit right now :)
[2022-12-31 17:53:36] <%+karlis121> @anoscura yee yee ass  haircut
[2022-12-31 17:53:36] <%+BarelyABearr> @smokin_hydro I mean, it wont help your aim, but it might get rid of some stutters you might be experiencing. I highly recommend 32gb for Tarkov anyways since it is so RAM and CPU dependent
[2022-12-31 17:53:43] <+VagtasticVoyage420> @Klean have u played reserve this wipe
[2022-12-31 17:53:49] <+smokin_hydro> yeah sorry 12700k
[2022-12-31 17:53:49] <vance_force_one> Labs tooo
[2022-12-31 17:53:53] <BenjiFactor> oooh interchange is good too
[2022-12-31 17:53:57] <zindre> Happy new years and happy 6years to you @Klean ! kleanTeef
[2022-12-31 17:54:02] <%anoscura> making sure nvidia settings/pc settings are setup properly helps too for tarkov
[2022-12-31 17:54:14] <+rawfrog_> What level do ragman quests unlock

[2022-12-31 17:54:59] <+smokin_hydro> @BarelyABearr yeah its not aim...it stutters real hard during cqb
[2022-12-31 17:55:06] <%anoscura> the hideout needs a bathhouse addition
[2022-12-31 17:55:10] <+crow_x99x> wtf is up with scavs taking forever to load in? only playing pmc every raid sucks at 20min que atm
[2022-12-31 17:55:18] <+rawfrog_> @official__crusader I’m 9 and nothing yet
[2022-12-31 17:55:19] <ItsRajev> Always with the Tarkov Tea @Klean Thats awsome info
[2022-12-31 17:55:22] <%+Bl4ck_B1rd_> @smokin_hydro FPS dropping have nothing to do with RAMs, so it's either an OS problem or something that's bottlenecking while on heavy render loads. Your CPU should be more than capable of running Tarkov so it's something else. Not Ram 100%
[2022-12-31 17:55:29] <+PumpkinMeatloaf> ahh ads happened as he was explaining sledge hammer
[2022-12-31 17:55:32] <SenorToast> Tagilla should drop em Kapp
[2022-12-31 17:55:39] <%+BarelyABearr> @smokin_hydro You could just run like your task manager on a second monitor and really see whats pushing your system.
[2022-12-31 17:55:43] <lebewm> @SenorToast that part
[2022-12-31 17:55:50] <%Official__Crusader> @rawfrog_ do you not have the interchange quest from him? might be locked behind a different quest you havent done yet
[2022-12-31 17:55:50] <%+karlis121> @smokin_hydro i used to have that, do a tarkov optimization guide on youtube
[2022-12-31 17:55:51] <+BrownBear2105> @crow_x99x how many servers do you have checked?  I added a few servers last night and it really, really helped.  Went from 15 min queues to 5 min queues
[2022-12-31 17:55:58] <%anoscura> @PumpkinMeatloaf it's loot only, you use it to break down a wall/door for hideout expansino
[2022-12-31 17:55:59] <ekozaur> I was watching aceu today and he found 2 sledges one after the other, different raids, spawns easy it seems
[2022-12-31 17:56:02] <%+BarelyABearr> @smokin_hydro I did that when I had 16gb and saw that my RAM was maxing out everytime causing stutters
[2022-12-31 17:56:04] <+Stang9663> @pumpkinmeatloaf i know dammit lol
[2022-12-31 17:56:14] <+PumpkinMeatloaf> @anoscura ok thanks

[2022-12-31 17:57:00] <%ElPonete> I love interchange... but its dificult to play now
[2022-12-31 17:57:11] <%ElPonete> With the audio
[2022-12-31 17:57:31] <+Stang9663> yeah same here its all good though still enjoy it
[2022-12-31 17:57:37] <%+Bl4ck_B1rd_> @ElPonete then mute the game KEKW
[2022-12-31 17:57:37] <+BermudaLines> i lag in interchange so bad Sadge
[2022-12-31 17:57:37] <%+BarelyABearr> Interchange is my goto scav map
[2022-12-31 17:57:59] <Armedanddangeruz> hey what's the best RAM brand. wanna get more since I'm only running 16
[2022-12-31 17:58:07] <+BrownBear2105> @crow_x99x definitely take it off of auto.  Choose the servers that have the best ping around you.  I chose any server that had less than 75 ping
[2022-12-31 17:58:08] <bmac1572> Only engage scavs from cover. I belaube It reduces there accuracy if your leaning behind cover,
[2022-12-31 17:58:30] <DeXZoR> Chat do we know anyother games that are in the same realm as EFT ?

[2022-12-31 17:58:41] <%+Bl4ck_B1rd_> @Armedanddangeruz if you're adding you have to get the same one you already own
[2022-12-31 17:58:41] <%+BarelyABearr> @Armedanddangeruz I use corsair and they are pretty good
[2022-12-31 17:58:44] <%ElPonete> I hope they improve the lighting and audio on Interchange before the next wipe
[2022-12-31 17:58:46] <imfinetill69> @DeXZoR stalker?
[2022-12-31 17:58:46] <%anoscura> @DeXZoR in terms of quality or genre?
[2022-12-31 17:58:57] <ataxdj> your aim is a bit off
[2022-12-31 17:59:05] <%anoscura> i use gskillz ram. Ram is about speed/latency
[2022-12-31 17:59:13] <DeXZoR> Diden know Stalker is pvepvpv @imfinetill69 is it ?
[2022-12-31 17:59:23] <%+Bl4ck_B1rd_> @Armedanddangeruz If you wanna go all new, i'd recommend either Corsair or GSkill
[2022-12-31 17:59:25] <Armedanddangeruz> @bl4ck_b1rd_ yeah that makes sense.
[2022-12-31 17:59:42] <DeXZoR> @anoscura meant you know the same sytel of game but not eft you know looter shoter pvepvp ect ect

[2022-12-31 18:00:50] <%anoscura> also chat, OC your pc and GPU helps a little bit with tarkov
[2022-12-31 18:01:14] <%anoscura> for instance, you can increase your RAM speed by OC'ing your pc
[2022-12-31 18:01:17] <+mr__matla> man in the market room on streets i been having so many luck with my drops in there !

[2022-12-31 18:01:38] <+Bold_Star> @anoscura if you can get a good stable OC, if not you'll make it worse
[2022-12-31 18:01:38] <+BlessedxJD> I haven’t tried that new little sub machine gun yet. How does it perform?
[2022-12-31 18:01:48] <DeXZoR> so what we can conclude is EFT is one of a kind game at the moment whed all the stuff thery doing @anoscura
[2022-12-31 18:02:05] <%anoscura> @anoscura I've used auto OC on asus mobo with little issue
[2022-12-31 18:02:05] <@%Ripper203> That initial kick is nuts though
[2022-12-31 18:02:11] <+rawfrog_> Flesh ammo?
[2022-12-31 18:02:12] <%+f0xxzz> ooof that recoil lol

[2022-12-31 18:02:15] <+Landon7K> imagin the 30s......
[2022-12-31 18:02:17] <Karut_> the initial recoil is rough tho
[2022-12-31 18:02:22] <ataxdj> damn

[2022-12-31 18:02:30] <%anoscura> @DeXZoR yeah pretty unique. Dayz scratches a similar itch but much less polished.

[2022-12-31 18:08:23] <%+succulenthamm> @raZor_US it's something you will develop the more you shoot. You need a good solid and high grip on the handgun. Take it slow at first

[2022-12-31 18:11:45] <ukly0> it's only vertical tho no ? recoil control is the importante one i feel like cause it reduces horizontal kick which is way harder to control imo @klean

[2022-12-31 18:11:58] <%+succulenthamm> @YaBoiNeedle 9mm kinda sucks IRL too, it's just the best handgun cartridge, that's why all secret squirell people use SBR ar15s in 5.56 or .300.

[2022-12-31 18:50:36] <+Dracoon> Tarkov is one of the best fps games ever made. Now its NOT a game for casual players if you don't play 8 hours a day every day after 1 week you will not win a pvp engagement unless your a god shot. but if you can get over that fact there is no game that replicates the intence situations and fun that this game gives

[2022-12-31 18:52:26] <tumadrebela> @Klean cheating could ruin the whole point of tarkov arena
[2022-12-31 18:52:39] <ohfuque> @UnbalancedKarma hell no they did that to WoW with the token. real money for gold, of course you kill RMT, but it's not good for the games health

[2022-12-31 18:52:55] <%+buttsu556> @dracoon not true at all. you don't need to play 8 hours a day. you need knowledge and past wipe experience I've been playing for 3 years and am only able to play 4 hours a day and sometimes not at all and am successful. I'm not insane at pvp either.

[2022-12-31 20:25:32] <TheUnknownFusion> is audio better or worse? I honestly cant tell by watching
[2022-12-31 20:25:33] <%ColeChiIls> @VoodooVI for americans? that arent felons? No not illegal, just gotta pay the price
[2022-12-31 20:25:56] <+orionixward> @VoodooVI the kit itself, probably. having it within a mile of what it goes into? will probably get your dog shot.
[2022-12-31 20:25:57] <%ColeChiIls> @TheUnknownFusion its a step in the right direction, with bugs galore of course :D

[2022-12-31 20:27:08] <+VanderSalad> Dorms audio fuckin slaps now, but then there are weird things like not being able to hear ANYTHING in bunkers like zb 012, not even gunshots
[2022-12-31 20:27:08] <+Tyrus_Rech> @VoodooVI You can usually own the components as long as they don't fit the system ex. FA M16 parts are fine to own...but if you put a third pin hole you go to the fedpen unless you have the licensing and pay to play

[2022-12-31 21:32:23] <ekozaur> @lillmazy it's a great CPU, but the AM4 is EOL. So next upgrade will also be a motherboard upgrade. If you go for AM5 or LGA1700, you might get some overhead (though I think the AM5 only supports DDR5)

[2022-12-31 22:43:30] <+Xylr> They should be experiencing the same thing. The packet loss typically happens when the server isn't able to process the communications from the clients fast enough resulting in things being processed as first come, first serve

[2022-12-31 23:40:03] <nickydeedles> isn;'t Labs highroller?
[2022-12-31 23:40:05] <vodzugaming> that would be heaven for cheaters
[2022-12-31 23:40:10] <+Chris2fast4u> WABS?
[2022-12-31 23:40:11] <coke212> high roller tarkov would be hacker city
[2022-12-31 23:40:19] <+c_h_r_i_s_t_i_4_n> isn't that kinda what key card labs was
[2022-12-31 23:40:21] <+w2lkm2n> That's called Lighthouse in Tarkov
[2022-12-31 23:40:24] <gladiusnova> that scav was Achilles KEKW

[2022-12-31 23:40:53] <EccentricMeat> A "high roller" would just be cheater heaven. Pass
[2022-12-31 23:40:56] <+w2lkm2n> Labs cards were super rare last wipe
[2022-12-31 23:40:58] <maciams> @Klean does this wipe have a different feel then the others?
[2022-12-31 23:41:01] <+Chris2fast4u> oOooo thats a dope idea...
[2022-12-31 23:41:09] <8enny8lanco> Labs….
[2022-12-31 23:41:18] <TSvassilev> like the weather? sometimes you get a desert, sometimes it's a horde
[2022-12-31 23:41:19] <8enny8lanco> You’re explaining labs
[2022-12-31 23:41:23] <%KevinSredz> but are scavs only tougher for YOU? or EVERYONE in that raid who didnt buy in
[2022-12-31 23:41:33] <+hippiekiller_666> Or different times of the day
[2022-12-31 23:41:33] <%+ZackLFC> it would be cool if there is a level 3 max armor lobbys
[2022-12-31 23:41:46] <8enny8lanco> Labs but not in labs?
[2022-12-31 23:41:47] <%BIGtoeknee> Someone say WABS?
[2022-12-31 23:42:01] <8enny8lanco> Raiders in other maps
[2022-12-31 23:42:12] <@%OddBawZ> That idea we pitched to Nikita for an hour every 6 hours it picks a map that has jacked up scavs but more loot is basically the same thing you're talking about.  Basically a map has a red border that has a scav war.
[2022-12-31 23:42:16] <@%OddBawZ> Super high risk for better reward.
[2022-12-31 23:42:28] <+pepega_champion> what if there was an item like a flare that called in bosses?
[2022-12-31 23:42:31] <+Eldad93> is it true that streets has a chance to spawn any boss or was that debunked?
[2022-12-31 23:42:34] <%xwatchingatworkx> have an all raider scav day
[2022-12-31 23:42:35] <8enny8lanco> Woods does have nuts scavs rn especially at the 10 min timer
[2022-12-31 23:42:37] <lokil93> there should be more areas like Labs, smaller areas that require a buy in
[2022-12-31 23:42:38] <%LegitBanana_> wow what a find
[2022-12-31 23:42:40] <zenmaster1112> Thats lifghthouse marked
