[2022-12-19 16:16:38] <+DanLGG> He turned and aimed behind him. I think he didn’t know snow was running to the left
[2022-12-19 16:16:39] <%SpectreUK> even if thats the case pulling out a gun regardless of what he was gonna shoot at doesnt matter

[2022-12-19 16:17:18] <%Apitoxin11> That was what I thought he was going to do in the moment and I was also thinking "Bruh you did not run far enough away from it" lol
[2022-12-19 16:17:18] <@%Zechss_> i was more inclined to think  he turned to shot you, thinkin you were behind him, but you had strafed to the side, thats my take

[2022-12-19 16:17:19] <%+Saichen> you juked to the left, he pointed where he thought you were

[2022-12-19 16:17:22] <+babygoat> Still you dont pull a gun when getting chased, it always ends bad
[2022-12-19 16:17:25] <%Uf0s8mycat> why would he turn and aim it though? even if he didnt mean to have the gun out, what was he going to do square up? @uhSnow
[2022-12-19 16:17:25] <+DanLGG> Still justified in losing his license
[2022-12-19 16:17:27] <%d3ltaf0x> you were just too fast with the tazer we needed a explosion 🤣

[2022-12-19 16:17:36] <%+killer1277> wouldn't he blow him self up if he shot it xD
[2022-12-19 16:17:44] <%+Demigoth1> it not like he got out the car and the gun was out and needed to be put away
[2022-12-19 16:17:53] <%+Demigoth1> that happens sometimes
[2022-12-19 16:17:57] <Lights_Outtx> he pulled out his gun regardless of what he said , actions speak more than words when it comes to anything

[2022-12-19 16:18:59] <+MediKul> why would he spin around with it out
[2022-12-19 16:19:00] <MsLittleKitten> like maybe half scuffed it was a stuff than fixed itself?
[2022-12-19 16:19:02] <+kanikuba> Sounds like hes saying he misclicked his keybind for that pocket or some shit

[2022-12-19 16:19:19] <%+amongthedankest> truuuu
[2022-12-19 16:19:23] <%Aleraen> So he not only aimed the gun but also fired?
[2022-12-19 16:19:23] <+SiemonSaid> Mac was right , people try to argue everything to keep their license.
[2022-12-19 16:19:27] <%SpectreUK> why you he do a full 180 and aim the gun almost instantly if he didnt mean to pull it
[2022-12-19 16:19:31] <+ray_bed> also might have gotten more mileage if he wasn't a dick about it KEKEW
[2022-12-19 16:19:35] <%+KennyWolf> He definitely aimed the gun and we've seen proof.
[2022-12-19 16:19:36] <+DanLGG> Do you press the aim down sight key when running?

[2022-12-19 16:19:40] <vincent_075> you don't fatfiner a key, do a legit 180 turn and aim down sight KEKW
[2022-12-19 16:19:42] <Lights_Outtx> yeah fat fingering than mouse click and holding is different
[2022-12-19 16:19:44] <+ARTBOB> fat fingering shouldnt be IC explanation
