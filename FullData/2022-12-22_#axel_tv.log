[2022-12-22 15:09:24] <razvank19> Maybe turn of auto ram cleaner, helped a friend
[2022-12-22 15:09:25] <farmer_brown134> @captain_chew so I‚Äôve heard of something similar, I know it might sound weird but try a different outlet
[2022-12-22 15:09:34] <akaMojioko> @captain_chew resolution?

[2022-12-22 15:10:40] <+captain_chew> @farmer_brown134 Oh like that I can try
[2022-12-22 15:10:43] <@%ImSoBurr_> did you install asus armory crate KEKW
[2022-12-22 15:10:53] <%+the_cage420> thermal issue or something like an improperly seated GPU making it run pci-e 1x instead of 16x sounds fairly likely to me
[2022-12-22 15:10:55] <!%$Bert_Bufftug> So since I've been crazy busy I havent seen what the pre-wipe event is. Whats going on atm?
[2022-12-22 15:11:01] <farmer_brown134> A dude I knew had an outlet that wasn‚Äôt putting out enough power and it wasn‚Äôt working correctly.

[2022-12-22 15:11:07] <+TheBolsheviks> @captain_chew it's not normal dude you should install the game with everything that is related to tarkov
[2022-12-22 15:11:10] <+captain_chew> I did run the heaven benchmark and had like 97% gpu usage when I play tarkov its only 30%

[2022-12-22 15:22:45] <persistentlywandering> Lmao I‚Äôm so bad at this game I don‚Äôt even know when someone might be cheating‚Ä¶ I just die, get scared and go again lmao
[2022-12-22 15:22:48] <fatdeeebs> hackers should be less prevalant with the flooding of normal players tho
[2022-12-22 15:22:50] <Arkeiroo> i rarely die to a non 1 tap, i feel ready for the wipe
[2022-12-22 15:22:52] <cloudz420x> and everyone thinks labs was bad for cheaters streets is gonna be infested
[2022-12-22 15:22:55] <@%ImSoBurr_> @captain_chew is 2400 the max speed your current ram can run? 3200 should be minimum imo

[2022-12-22 15:23:29] <razvank19> Axel what would you think of goons in bunker
[2022-12-22 15:23:29] <@%ImSoBurr_> @farmer_brown134 there are actual russians that could give you a better definition, but essentially that's what it is. "There he is, get him"
[2022-12-22 15:23:30] <%+TheGTed> what language is that xdd
[2022-12-22 15:23:40] <+FerociousAR> jedec timing is going to be 2133 for most ddr4 dimms and the xmp profiles they support determine what you run the ram past that
[2022-12-22 15:23:46] <+captain_chew> @ImSoBurr_ Yea the kit is 2400 mhz. I have xmp enabled but I guess that won't make a differnce cuz my ram is 2400mhz
[2022-12-22 15:24:14] <@%ImSoBurr_> @captain_chew Yup, for sure. Find some compatible 3200 or whatever the max speed your mobo/cpu can handle

[2022-12-22 15:32:59] <Ruski_Doll> its just the twitch bitrate i dont think theres anything you can do
[2022-12-22 15:32:59] <FakeJake1349> ye around the spawn it was pixelated, watching on 1080p
[2022-12-22 15:33:05] <%cwissttv> @Axel_tv in the chronicles gluhar was all tactical, ingame they walk through doors
[2022-12-22 15:33:06] <fembo1_> bro wiped the whole glukhar squad with 1 mag
[2022-12-22 15:33:07] <FakeJake1349> grass kills it a little i think which is usual

[2022-12-22 15:35:24] <+PyreanTV> 1080p is fine, don't worry about it too much, filter makes everything terrrible instead of just grass
[2022-12-22 15:35:28] <Fakie13> it's probably better indoors the filter
[2022-12-22 15:35:30] <FakeJake1349> just close your eyes when you look at the grass Clueless
[2022-12-22 15:35:34] <@%ImSoBurr_> what if you drop in game sharpness down a couple notches @Axel_tv

[2022-12-22 15:58:35] <@%^Nightbot> @Yuki_Duki  Chatters can fight to time each other out for 10 minutes. To start a fight, redeem the 3333 channel point option and @ your opponent. If they accept, both participants say !roll to roll a number. The higher roll wins, and the lower roll gets a time out. Ties are a reroll.

[2022-12-22 16:10:50] <@%ImSoBurr_> @Chrischros1 if I didn't have to use the SVD, I would use SNB all the time too LUL

[2022-12-22 16:15:26] <@%$atownmanx> @ImSoBurr_ i have a feeling if they ever put in something like a PKM with full auto in that caliber, that the BT would shine a bit more because of the recoil reduction, but idk. with .54R being mostly only bolts it's just not that big a deal

[2022-12-22 17:20:40] <%Uragan_tv> atm my best guess is 26th

[2022-12-22 17:21:17] <%mart21_> @Uragan_tv yeah, like old events, the pictures mean something, there were 6 shotgun shells so Im betting 26th aswell
[2022-12-22 17:21:27] <iacewheeler> No way wipe is next week
[2022-12-22 17:21:45] <%Illshadow937> I enjoyed helping with the ammo for the vid i hope it helped get it out faster than it would have been

[2022-12-22 17:22:20] <yungskoomafiend> i havent heard shots or anything
[2022-12-22 17:22:23] <SuAmAeEmChAmAs> it depends on the content

[2022-12-22 17:22:46] VIEWERS: 786
[2022-12-22 17:22:48] <%BogBoss_> how much damage does it do?
[2022-12-22 17:22:51] <iSnipeLikeJesus> I think if you are pumping out content, having editors makes sense because it gives you more time
[2022-12-22 17:23:00] <+BurebistaWSMN> you can have an editor for a clips channel and make the vids for the main one yourself
[2022-12-22 17:23:03] <%Massaraksh> @Axel_tv i missed how much those new bullets deal damage to TOZ, is it like destroyed after 3 shots?
[2022-12-22 17:23:04] <+Operator_McMillan> Do yourself. Editing is a great skill so it is worth the time investment.
[2022-12-22 17:23:06] <%rattrap_yt> editors? division of labor and all
[2022-12-22 17:23:11] <Bekyquqi> @Axel_tv i think its really makes your content the definition of what you meant to say
[2022-12-22 17:23:18] <%Êö¥Ë∫ÅÁöÑÁôΩÁæä (arieslin94)> jam ammo
[2022-12-22 17:23:31] <+sns_ace> Anyone local to you that edits would be cool

[2022-12-22 17:23:36] <@%ImSoBurr_> yo
[2022-12-22 17:23:42] <%rattrap_yt> depends on the amount of content and whether you *want* to produce yourself vs. create more content, say

[2022-12-22 19:33:18] <%Noduska> using thermal is kinda brain dead play cus you dont have to react unless you see RED. i tried using the 17mil nightvision and it was ehhhh
[2022-12-22 19:33:24] <Taki12> if u dont want to fight with other players woods are best money maker tbh

[2022-12-22 19:35:33] <@%^Nightbot> @garling_wolf  Chatters can fight to time each other out for 10 minutes. To start a fight, redeem the 3333 channel point option and @ your opponent. If they accept, both participants say !roll to roll a number. The higher roll wins, and the lower roll gets a time out. Ties are a reroll.
