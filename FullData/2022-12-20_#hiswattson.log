Everyone else gave me strange looks and were saying things like “what the fuck” and “call the police”. I dropped my phone and everyone around me saw this stream. Now there is a whole train of men masturbating together at this stream. This is your fault, you could have prevented this if you had just tagged this stream NSFW.

[2022-12-20 14:53:41] <!%SchugDoog> When I was 10 years old . Arbys came out with the 3 for $5 sandwich deal. Wow, what a great deal I thought. 3 sandwiches for $5 hell yes I’ll buy those arbys. 15 years later arby’s came out with the same 3 for $5 meal. And I came to the realization . Either inflation has never hit arbys, or they have been screwing me over for years.

[2022-12-20 16:13:15] <+fIanneldan> he doesnt have aim assist tho
[2022-12-20 16:13:16] <kalex03x> It would so fast and destroy your other arm, then you are useless
[2022-12-20 16:13:21] <$thedeadguy_> you're thinking of a dog that doesnt hunt to kill grabbing your arm. wolves grab your neck
[2022-12-20 16:13:23] <@%$turtleTiff> i could take on a wolf (im just built like that)

[2022-12-20 16:13:44] <+GeorgieLive> a wolf would actually go for the neck and thats basically an instant kill

No, not shungite, those stupid fuckin rocks that crazy antivaxxers buy. I'm talkin' Suge Knight. Anyways, he's a popular music executive, but now in prison because he murdered somebody. That's my story, I bought a whole bunch of albums. Put 'em around the la casa. Little records, stuff like that.

[2022-12-20 19:47:03] <%S1_Dare> The McDonald's here is slow and sloppy like it was made fast but you always wait 15 to 20 mins even if there's no one else in front of you

[2022-12-20 20:16:16] <+cesare_egb> because the password companies have dedicated teams to improve this management/security constantly that is their business model, as for a Twitch their business is streaming they dont want to invest on password management

[2022-12-20 20:16:24] <$thank_ufor_subscribing> a lot of the time, most websites never properly predict how much traffic they get especially when something viral happens that causes site crashes. More attention = more possibility for an attack, which allows a small window to prepare
[2022-12-20 20:16:25] <+rodrik076> @voodoobunny__x_x that can be decrypted
[2022-12-20 20:16:32] <+popepsychedelic> all passwords are encrypted by these companies...  But if you have a leak of data, then you can run brute force attempts on that encrypted data.   If you password is "weak" then it will take seconds to crack the encryption

[2022-12-20 20:31:34] <%+BongHits4Africa> Skill issue obviously
[2022-12-20 20:31:39] <+Gromi7> the answer to orisa is to ignore orisa. She doesnt do enough dmg to merit your focus.
[2022-12-20 20:31:45] <%+QueenAlyx_> I mean that's the right move, orisa is unkillable with good supports

[2022-12-20 20:50:15] <+Flyzenberg> forreal tho @HisWattson best solution is a counter dive, play a tracer or genji and get into their healer line. One pick and the fight is yours
[2022-12-20 20:50:32] <ozbicc> play sojourn, tracer or genji
[2022-12-20 20:50:34] <%theversausage> or go junk and just spam

[2022-12-20 21:36:17] <%theversausage> they seem to prioritize queue times over match quality right now
[2022-12-20 21:36:18] <%+Hitosherizu> If you think Apex MMing is fucked, just play OW for a minute
[2022-12-20 21:36:27] <$thank_ufor_subscribing> it just means within the 7 games you player you placed higher MMR. Because you have less games on healer your MMR is more radical
[2022-12-20 21:36:32] <$thank_ufor_subscribing> played*
[2022-12-20 21:36:36] <%theversausage> you get 1-2min queues but awful matches

[2022-12-20 21:40:59] <bataskb> I 100% believe that Apex is still the best BR out there. No one else comes close yayayayayaya
[2022-12-20 21:41:11] <Octaviously> y is everyone playing ow2 today?
[2022-12-20 21:41:13] <sharton83> @gskunk12 not even spider solitaire, just regular

[2022-12-20 21:41:46] <+lorenzostreamer> @bataskb TRhe best BR but a terrible ranked system. The space is wide open to be exploited right now
[2022-12-20 21:41:56] <%+Sinmara> They must REALLY want people to play this game
[2022-12-20 21:41:59] <sharton83> I think he also played The Sims

[2022-12-20 21:42:16] <yokai_potempkin> replayability matters
[2022-12-20 21:42:21] <%OsivienTv> when in ult if your in the circle his ult will keep going if hes doing damage
[2022-12-20 21:42:26] <%theversausage> ult doesnt decrease as long as its hitting someone
[2022-12-20 21:42:31] <SourPinapples> @gskunk12 bro must be like fucking 12
[2022-12-20 21:42:32] <@%thecrookthatcancook> he played warframe before apex gskunk12
[2022-12-20 21:42:34] <cynic_08> hit ult meter doesnt go down when people are in the AOE
[2022-12-20 21:42:34] <+sjsharks408> you have to play outside of his radius
[2022-12-20 21:42:39] <+lorenzostreamer> @sharton83 No just sims city
[2022-12-20 21:42:44] <%Mi_fbi_agent> his ult has a time limit but the time doesnt run out in your in the vircle
