[2022-12-17 04:24:15] <ScaCoyote> I would do a planned 3 seasons. Season 1 focusing on the backstory and universe building and the signs of the coming Horus Heresy. Season 2 the start of the Horus Heresy and the beginnings of it. Season 3 it the heart of it and the Emperor stepping in to do his thing as well as the aftermath.

[2022-12-17 04:27:14] <@%+Nikolai_Von_Imhof> @BurkeBlack Start in a Hive City, similar to Darktide, you have that standard people working, and Cavill or whoever is coming to inspect part of the city for Heresy. Keep things more humanish the first season, with an infestation of one of the chaos factions, they deal with that for majority of the season, and at the end "save" the city, and ending of the season, you have an X class invasion, Orks or Tyranids for the second season.
[2022-12-17 04:27:16] <+Studdl3y> wheel of time was butchered

[2022-12-17 04:29:42] <%Oppai_Nani> @Studdl3y mb^^ thought you were speaking about it bc burke mentioned it
[2022-12-17 04:29:42] <+Zedserious> There is also Resident Evil on amazon so they are about 50/50
[2022-12-17 04:29:45] <californiaexodus> @BurkeBlack what would somebody find if they searched your computer history?
[2022-12-17 04:29:47] <%Oppai_Nani> burkeKek
[2022-12-17 04:29:53] <gamebre> they do have good show but ring of power is not one those
[2022-12-17 04:29:58] <%goth_milk> i only got through the first 3 seasons of The Expanse, and it just..lost me
[2022-12-17 04:29:58] <+Studdl3y> lain, the expanse didn't finish, it legit "finished" in the middle
[2022-12-17 04:30:01] <RespectablePenizSize> well its about the writers and if they give a fuck about the lore.

[2022-12-17 04:30:20] <Jedgar6> amazon pays the bills and host the content. It depends who is writing it and directing it. The people that did wheel of time are doing god of war. I have no trust in that.
[2022-12-17 04:30:23] <%Oppai_Nani> I enjoyed rings of power more than house of the dragon burkeKek

[2022-12-17 04:31:56] <jspencer1379> ring of power got ruined for me when the dwarf women didnt have beards. in the lore u cant tell the difference between the men snd women
[2022-12-17 04:31:59] <ScaCoyote> You could really tell the first half the season they were scrambling to recover from losing the rights but managed to bring things together and finished strong.

[2022-12-17 06:28:18] <%+gryphon77731> probably best to start at 40k and have the backstory already there

[2022-12-17 06:29:09] <%+WastingSanity> Season 1 would have to do with human kind, both sides. Season 2 they could do another race.
[2022-12-17 06:29:16] <Kiitter> i would probably go Eisenhorn.. THEN Horus heresy

[2022-12-17 06:30:00] <%vexatd> Then season 4, henry gets replaced by liam hemsworth burkeCreep

[2022-12-17 06:59:36] <%+WastingSanity> the table top models always made Ogryn a bit bigger than a marine.
[2022-12-17 06:59:49] <Kiitter> they are just made out of human stuff, space marines have stuff like chests made of titanium
[2022-12-17 06:59:54] <%+MandalorianArmy> They do just sterile
[2022-12-17 06:59:57] <%+Mangyanimal> They all giant ken dolls
[2022-12-17 07:00:00] <%+WastingSanity> They have no woman to use it on.
[2022-12-17 07:00:02] <%+Khyberos> @epiclol86 yes but they've been changed so much they don't really think about "using" it
[2022-12-17 07:00:04] <+DjEclectic> They don't use it to pee?

[2022-12-17 07:00:56] <an_p0> i really want to see plague marines in movie, never saw them outside of figures
[2022-12-17 07:01:06] <%+Khyberos> @war1910 no. eldar and humans look similar physically but they are completely different biologically
[2022-12-17 07:01:06] <%+MandalorianArmy> Females are not compatible to the astartes gene therapy so there are no female astartes
[2022-12-17 07:01:09] <Kiitter> @AussiexTexan in lore, not officially no, though you could always say F that and make a fan made chapter that is *shrug*

[2022-12-17 07:02:03] <%+JaneInTheBox> @AussiexTexan not really, some consider the Sisters of Battle (Adapta Sororitas) to be them but while they do have some sort of powered armor, they are not genetically enhanced like the Space Marines - they do have some other fun stuff

[2022-12-17 07:18:03] <$Shreddedhobbit> So random question, just thought about this? What if, they released a Star citizen type Warhammer game? You can pick your character and it’s exactly like Star citizen, you go to different planets for the emperor hahaha

[2022-12-17 07:19:20] <%Lain_2779> so it could lay the groundwork for a 40k big scale mmo

You yourself have given credit that MCU made a "better" version of Thanos, and you have to at least give them the benefit of the doubt they can do the same with Kang. theyve earned that at least.

[2022-12-17 12:48:38] <Shivalla> There is some cosplayers who have rocked Space Marine armors. It's doable.
[2022-12-17 12:48:38] <%Malloc_III> @Danidude88 and then use cgi to have him play all his sons too
[2022-12-17 12:48:40] <Egergames> those Space Marine cosplays are so bulky even the cosplayers need assistants to get them to move

[2022-12-17 12:48:58] <gamebre> I think CGI is best Idea for space Marine
[2022-12-17 12:49:01] <JeXus1985> I really think they're going the Inquisitor route, much more practical in that sense
[2022-12-17 12:49:06] <%The3Kingdoms> if its made our of plastic maybe n just add metal noises... they might pull it off
[2022-12-17 12:49:07] <%+WastingSanity> I wouldn't be surprised if they do all the marines in CGI because of the armor.

[2022-12-17 12:53:13] <EnergyCrow> NODDERS please
[2022-12-17 12:53:17] <%+WastingSanity> Henry Cavill is 6 and 1/2 tall. So honestly they don't need massively tall extras.
[2022-12-17 12:53:17] <TheLostAlien> yes
[2022-12-17 12:53:24] <Egergames> man kinda sucks when Black Adam was alright now DC has to reconstruct

[2022-12-17 12:53:57] <%+WastingSanity> Plus in a lot of the scenes the armor could be from the waist up.
