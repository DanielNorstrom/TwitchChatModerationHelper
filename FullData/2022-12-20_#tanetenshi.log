[2022-12-20 04:24:23] <%Marxus_Cattimore> Dear Sensei. On behalf of me and Satanix, I want to say thank you for being one of the kindest, sweetest, funniest and most cultured Vtuber we've ever met! I remember the first day I joined your stream. During your subathon. I joined for the model that had only debuted recently at the time. And you even picked me up when I was done. In short, just... many big thanks. <3

[2022-12-20 08:30:22] <@%toilet_rush> have you tried slime rancher?
[2022-12-20 08:30:23] <Belades1> Luna Nights is also a metroidvania
[2022-12-20 08:30:29] <+angelframe> Someone out there is going to be like "yeah it's like a bullet hell Fate. Super easy to understand. Okay first we gotta start with this specific and bad version".
[2022-12-20 08:30:48] <@%toilet_rush> slime rancher is my ultimate relaxing game
[2022-12-20 08:30:52] <%InfernoZtorm> Oh that reminds me I have Touhou: Scarlet Curiosity from Steam I need to get back and play again
[2022-12-20 08:30:58] <%+OPhANIMsat> Start with shoot the bullet /s
[2022-12-20 08:31:02] <Belades1> most of the mainline games are on steam and only need an english patch these days.  luna nights comes in english though

[2022-12-20 08:31:51] <@%toilet_rush> I'm shocked to see tane has been streaming for almost 5 and a half hours I love it
[2022-12-20 08:32:00] <Belades1> steam is missing about three main games and several sidegames.  and all of the pc98 games of course.  everything else is there though

[2022-12-20 08:32:59] <Belades1> duck rate seems to be based on how many ducks you have loaded iirc.  the more ducks you have loaded the slower it is
[2022-12-20 08:33:18] <%$princeduckydylan> Yes

[2022-12-20 09:02:45] <%$cat_lionheart> I think it depends on what you teach and how often the knowlge changes.

[2022-12-20 09:20:53] <%roxas1373> I thought Hufflepuff for the jocks and Gryffindor would like to delinquents because Gryffindor was like Brave
[2022-12-20 09:20:59] <!%vividlyVIVI> which is children's book talk for "evil"

[2022-12-20 09:38:34] <%$matchstickwick> I don’t have as much time to read as I’d like, so I listen to a lot of audio books instead while I work. I’ve been enjoying the silly nonsense of a series known as, “Tales from the Gas Station” by Jack Townsend. It just released its fourth book, and I’m going to buy the physical copies alongside using audible to get the audio book.

[2022-12-20 09:51:08] <%$cat_lionheart> No clue. If so it is pretty old by now. \
[2022-12-20 09:51:58] <%$matchstickwick> Paranorman and Kubo are still good though. I watched Jordan Peele and Henry Selick’s Wendell and Wild which is a new stop motion film, but it just didn’t know what it wanted to be, what plot it wanted to follow, and where to go with the characters. It’s not a good film which is sad, because it seemed like it might have had potential. There are times I just wish I could invade a writing team and slap some sense into whomever decided those scripts and plots were a good idea.

[2022-12-20 09:57:14] <%$matchstickwick> Coraline’s weakest point is a lingering post climax conflict in which you feel like the film’s slowed or should have slowed, but is continuing. Like if you were on a rollercoaster, you’ve finally slowed down, the area to get off is right in front of you, and suddenly you jerk forward really quickly into the offloading area for no reason… even if it makes sense in context to the story.

[2022-12-20 10:00:01] <%$matchstickwick> If there is one thing I find as a pet peeve in films, it’s a bad sense of pacing. It’s difficult to master, but more recently, every film has become super and unnecessarily fast paced. If we look to Studio Ghibli, they actually coined a term for scenes that hold no real story purpose except for allowing the audience a chance to breathe and  think. Soak in what they’ve watched.

[2022-12-20 10:03:10] <%$matchstickwick> For me, bad pacing is a scene for scene thing. Specifically dialogue. When characters don’t think before speaking. There is a method to using fast speaking characters, but when it’s a dramatic scene, you end up with characters talking way too fast to one another to a degree that it’s just unnatural. All so they can hurry the plot along.

[2022-12-20 10:04:06] <%Scythe_Seven> It seems like anime of the old days all had at least 24+ episodes, and now anime are usually just one season of 12-13. So old anime would have the episode numbers to be able to be slow paced.
