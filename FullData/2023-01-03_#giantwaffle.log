[2023-01-03 15:47:50] <%$Mandorake> NFL football is extremely dangerous compared to other sports
[2023-01-03 15:47:51] <Harmar> alot of the problems now is there being reported more often
[2023-01-03 15:48:06] <%+P00nDozer69> that's the concussion one right?
[2023-01-03 15:48:09] <Harmar> they use to hide the issues (the players themselves)
[2023-01-03 15:48:09] <%banshay3> @Mandorake he tackeld a guy, got up and then just collapsed
[2023-01-03 15:48:13] <%$Mandorake> ya CTE is what kills players after the fact

[2023-01-03 15:48:18] <glove_17> just slam each other is crazy to think of it,
[2023-01-03 15:48:19] <nvrmissashot> Like harmar said, it's actually being reported now so they can't brush it under the rug

[2023-01-03 17:22:11] <Commander_Cooler> I just got a 3070 ti for 959 Canadian after taxes and that was with a $ 200 off sale  :(
[2023-01-03 17:22:18] <stormzwest> @Giantwaffle energy per connection is thermal exclusive
[2023-01-03 17:22:29] <@%+Nexhunter> @Apparentthreat well nvidia is also accounting in for tarrif hits but the USTR to everyone surprise delayed gpu tarrifs coming back for another 9 months
[2023-01-03 17:22:37] <%Rongoel> I bought mz 3080ti at the for like 900 last zear
[2023-01-03 17:22:42] <%DaemonSzyman> if it was max bandwidth, increasing # of dynamos would not increase power
[2023-01-03 17:22:49] <le_Pure> Commander_Cooler bruh im still waiting for 1 under 900 PepeHands
[2023-01-03 17:22:53] <%DaemonSzyman> exactly

[2023-01-03 17:22:56] <%+fisering1> But is it max 32k through the p2p channel then?
[2023-01-03 17:22:57] <%Winstonrocks> enderio is max connection but there is only one connection into the me p2p so each p2p is maxed at 32k power
[2023-01-03 17:23:04] <@%$Apparentthreat> It's not like the "conduit" fills up like in other power mods.
[2023-01-03 17:23:11] <stormzwest> place a acapacitor bank between the dynamos andd power line and check IO
[2023-01-03 17:23:11] <%DaemonSzyman> Thats what im saying, its proof its not bandwidth
[2023-01-03 17:23:22] <%Yogithebaer> ive missed the last few days and it looks like the done by new year goal didnt happen
[2023-01-03 17:23:28] <rododendro> there is a probe to see stats for the conduits, so you can check input and output and storage
[2023-01-03 17:23:44] <%+novaworkmannn> I think it counts the whole block area where the connection is so I don’t think this will work
[2023-01-03 17:23:50] <lilgangstagoth1> the conduit dose have a total capacity
[2023-01-03 17:24:14] <MrArrig> Coding wise its probably so much more efficient to not have each line have a bandwidth
[2023-01-03 17:24:25] <Fligon_> enderio is such a good pack god damn

[2023-01-03 18:03:00] <GuardMoony> It's worth noting that the VR/AR headset is totally different from the rumored Apple Glasses. Those are said to be purely AR-focused and aren't likely to arrive anytime soon. Meanwhile, the VR/AR headset could be here as soon as 2023, and it's likely to compete with the Meta Quest 2, PSVR 2 and all the other best VR headsets.

[2023-01-03 18:09:45] <%+LiveType> 4090 is great. Well worth it over the 3090 if you can use the performance
[2023-01-03 18:09:50] <+Koeckie> and you are working with it
[2023-01-03 18:09:51] <+noxiiiouse> i want the new stuff but its to much money @Giantwaffle

[2023-01-03 18:09:57] <%+JimmyHuren> and you get tax wrtie-off
[2023-01-03 18:09:57] <%+TPells67> If your gonna upgrade make it t drastic but not unreasonable expensive
[2023-01-03 18:09:59] <+Uzi_Shamgar> I went to a 6950xt and don't see much reason to upgrade anytime soon either. Nvidia's new stuff isn't worth it
[2023-01-03 18:10:00] <Grimstar_> What about your cpu?
[2023-01-03 18:10:09] <Dexy2811> yeah i went from 2080s to 4090 :P
[2023-01-03 18:10:10] <fbritoferreira> I think the new thing is going to be power efficiency to the 4000 series is the last one with this crazy power
[2023-01-03 18:10:13] <%MakerOfThingys> It's great when you wait three generations to upgrade.
[2023-01-03 18:10:13] <+Koeckie> TRUE!

[2023-01-03 18:10:33] <%brocreed1> I think the market goes in cycles. Currently we are in a market situation where there was a high demand for high performance, but now we will enter a market where consumers want economical options and the suppliers will be forced to comply or meet lower revenue.

[2023-01-03 18:11:19] <%+LiveType> Not true. Folks are only buying the 4090. Everything else is still in stock
[2023-01-03 18:11:22] <+xaler2> didnt nvidea come out with that big press report like a year ago about making their cards worse for miners though
[2023-01-03 18:11:24] <$Rolymole09> Cheaper to limit production than to sell at a loss
[2023-01-03 18:11:30] <Tamerlain> they priced it with 3080 be 4060 performance in mind
[2023-01-03 18:11:36] <poop_nukem> They priced to to cut out the middle man scalping cards from the COVID and GPU shortage. But the demand is lower now and they are hurting bad on their greedy move.
[2023-01-03 18:11:39] <+jmm548> if amd can keep up the compitition maybe it will help on next generation
[2023-01-03 18:11:41] <%Littleme02> din't we all agree the stupid prices was to encourage selling of the large stocks of 3000series cards?
[2023-01-03 18:11:45] <fbritoferreira> nvidia is just not going to release lower end card this gen to salvage their stuff, they tried to have two 3080 for a reason
[2023-01-03 18:11:49] <GuardMoony> The problem is more for the vendors of GPU's.

[2023-01-03 18:12:02] <Tamerlain> like cmon guyz they still pumping 3080 production and launching new models here and there for 2 old product
[2023-01-03 18:12:04] <obylix> I just built a high end PC as a non enthusiast that I wanted to keep it usable for 8 years. and I put a 4080 in it (bought at cost, so $300, below MSRP) and I'm okay with it
[2023-01-03 18:12:05] <+StarThiefAtomsk> That's why I just buy last gen cards.
[2023-01-03 18:12:07] <+Sentinel1_9> @giantwaffle only 4090 if they want 3080 theyre going amd or 3090

[2023-01-03 23:07:01] <+kidgrim2001_> Kappa200 do you think fusion energy is actually “20 years away” now
[2023-01-03 23:07:13] <JHoyt74> What happened to nerdfusion?
[2023-01-03 23:07:22] <Tapeman83> "sort of"
[2023-01-03 23:07:33] <ligerzerof> it
[2023-01-03 23:07:34] <%+Askjong> We generated 1.5x power
[2023-01-03 23:07:38] <splix661> electric tools for crafting could be useful?
[2023-01-03 23:07:38] <Smileynator> but yeah still many hurdles it seems
[2023-01-03 23:07:38] <%Loopy9999> more a milestone than breakthrough
[2023-01-03 23:07:43] <@%Kuroiorb> became a different company, waffle left a while ago @JHoyt74
[2023-01-03 23:07:44] <ligerzerof> it's a scientific equivalent of a party trick
[2023-01-03 23:07:51] <$kidgrim2001_> We broke even on the amount of laser energy put in but overall it was still negative
[2023-01-03 23:07:53] <+ricotez> fusion has been 20 years away for like 50 years now
[2023-01-03 23:07:54] <novicio_> @Sui_Ume  in 2023 or before the end of 2023?
[2023-01-03 23:07:55] <ligerzerof> it's completely non practical
[2023-01-03 23:07:56] <Sui_Ume> @Giantwaffle it's the first time they produced more power then they inserted, the problem is it lasted only for like a microsecond
[2023-01-03 23:07:57] <Smileynator> problem is "making it run longer, without massive overhead/cost/maintenance" for the most of them.
[2023-01-03 23:07:59] <Armathur> its not decay
[2023-01-03 23:08:04] <%+plattnotpratt> fusion is just combining
[2023-01-03 23:08:06] <coolcake2> E = MC^2. we sacrafise M for E
[2023-01-03 23:08:06] <+Damos1212> the energy comes from the released neutrons i think?
[2023-01-03 23:08:08] <deadgolfer> combing element releases the energy
[2023-01-03 23:08:09] <Armathur> you fuse the elements
[2023-01-03 23:08:10] <JHoyt74> @Kuroiorb Oh okay Thank you! Havent been in stream in a bit
[2023-01-03 23:08:12] <+Sam_1443> its not the daecay the fusion process releases energy
[2023-01-03 23:08:14] <Rollingx> It’s the process of fusion that produces energy
[2023-01-03 23:08:16] <Variosit> its not ammount of the energy we can currently get
[2023-01-03 23:08:16] <%Loopy9999> yea its still net negative by factors
[2023-01-03 23:08:19] <+DrYProtoss> heavy = 2 light + excess energy
[2023-01-03 23:08:20] <HolyIceCube> mass different
[2023-01-03 23:08:21] <+prairydog> creates energy
[2023-01-03 23:08:25] <%+Grunden> It's the strong nuclear force
[2023-01-03 23:08:26] <%Narcotical> 'just combining' is a bit of an understatement
[2023-01-03 23:08:27] <SuicidalSquirrel> You fire lasers at the elements to excite them and they fuse and release more energy. They have just released more than they put in
[2023-01-03 23:08:28] <Smileynator> fusion makes the same energy as atom splitting in atomic bombs
[2023-01-03 23:08:30] <%+DaChibi> Simone Gietz did basic fusion in her workshop in a recent vid.
[2023-01-03 23:08:31] <Sui_Ume> @novicio_ both LUL
[2023-01-03 23:08:32] <ligerzerof> no, it loses mass
[2023-01-03 23:08:34] <coolcake2> E = MC^2. We sacrafise M for E

[2023-01-03 23:08:35] <Variosit> its the ammount of energy we get out of a system vs putting in
[2023-01-03 23:08:36] <keittehvan> up to iron, the fusion releases energy, after iron it consumes
[2023-01-03 23:08:39] <SpiderQueen7202> Nah, the combining releases neutrons and heat
[2023-01-03 23:08:39] <%Dagmoo> well not fusion but it was Lawrence Livermore labs hit a laser on some crystal and got positive energy
[2023-01-03 23:08:41] VIEWERS: 2 564
[2023-01-03 23:08:41] <+ricotez> if you're making something lighter than iron it gives off energy, if you're making something heavier than iron it takes energy
[2023-01-03 23:08:43] <monepok> the resulting atom has less mass than the ingredients
[2023-01-03 23:08:44] <+DrYProtoss> the heavy weighs less than the sum of the two lights
[2023-01-03 23:08:45] <Kyuutsune_> The breakthrough was that they put in less energy than they got back
[2023-01-03 23:08:46] <%+Askjong> Video time? PauseChamp
[2023-01-03 23:08:47] <PotatoWielder> it's the e=mc^2, the difference in mass get released as radiation
[2023-01-03 23:08:50] <+jayjjalen> smart ass twitch chat for no reason xD
[2023-01-03 23:08:51] <%omar21cu> the problem isnt with making the fusion happen, its all about making net positive energy from it
[2023-01-03 23:08:52] <+DrYProtoss> the excess mass comes out as energy
[2023-01-03 23:08:53] <%lazyhot> @coolcake2 correct!
[2023-01-03 23:08:56] <%+Grav1s> The problem was always that it took more energy for fusion than what it produced.
[2023-01-03 23:08:58] <Smileynator> 2 things combine, some lose parts come off AGRESSIVELY and those make for good energy.
[2023-01-03 23:08:59] <zloezelo> fusion is IRL cheating
[2023-01-03 23:08:59] <%+ynneI> @Giantwaffle In a fusion reaction, two light nuclei merge to form a single heavier nucleus. The process releases energy because the total mass of the resulting single nucleus is less than the mass of the two original nuclei. The leftover mass becomes energy. end qutoe
[2023-01-03 23:09:03] <+Sam_1443> theres a good video on fusion
[2023-01-03 23:09:03] <+jayjjalen> mfs just start randomly talking about nuclear fusion

[2023-01-03 23:09:23] BITS: kidgrim2001_ (100)
[2023-01-03 23:09:23] <$kidgrim2001_> Kappa100 when you fuse atoms it doesn’t necessarily add mass so when you get the new element that excess mass is turned into heat which makes steam and turns a turbine
[2023-01-03 23:09:27] <Variosit> we can now do that
[2023-01-03 23:09:28] <Stoods_> The energy comes from e=mc^2, so you take two hevier atoms and turn them into a light atom. The missing matter gets turned into energy.
[2023-01-03 23:09:29] <+Blazedude99> what does a better muffler even do?
[2023-01-03 23:09:31] <%+Gamernxc> did u watch the new settled video btw
[2023-01-03 23:09:36] <@%Kuroiorb> we just finally were able to get more energy out of the reaction than we put in to make fusion happen
[2023-01-03 23:09:38] <%+ynneI> @Giantwaffle the mass of the atom created from the two atoms in fusion in less than the mass of the two atoms
[2023-01-03 23:09:42] <%Andersxa> so with the e=mc^2 formula is it then energy = (m1-m2)*c^2? from fusion?
[2023-01-03 23:09:43] <$BlueberryKing> Combining elements lighter than iron releases energy (so fusion is done with hydrogen). Splitting heavy elements releases energy (so fission is done with uranium), the changeover between those two happens at iron
[2023-01-03 23:09:45] <%$Venamah> basically fusion, is making a minutre sun on earth
[2023-01-03 23:09:54] <coolcake2> The Problem is that even thought "Techincally" we got more energy INside the chamber, the Total energy of the system is still negative @Giantwaffle
[2023-01-03 23:09:56] <Tapeman83> i'm not really a fan of the single inventory slot
[2023-01-03 23:09:57] <+DJ_4point0> Lemme go crack out my phisics notes
[2023-01-03 23:09:58] <%+Askjong> no
[2023-01-03 23:10:03] <%+Gamernxc> i dislike the concept too
[2023-01-03 23:10:04] <%+Askjong> we like that stuff
[2023-01-03 23:10:05] <sogerr> 2 atoms fuse and release neutrons to keep stable, the neutrons released at high speed heat water next to it and then its normal steam energy flow
[2023-01-03 23:10:09] <%minizen> is it the 1 inv slot?
[2023-01-03 23:10:17] <%minizen> ohh i saw that, didnt click on it
[2023-01-03 23:10:22] <Tapeman83> what I did like was his idea of being able to unlock more slots as he goes
[2023-01-03 23:10:24] <+334Productions> Check out Real Engineering's video on the fusion company Helion
[2023-01-03 23:10:30] <%DaemonSzyman> so... its just going to be a lot of walking to banks?

[2023-01-03 23:10:52] <@%$SailorWS> and 1 prayer
[2023-01-03 23:11:01] <Armathur> @Giantwaffle basically if you try to fuse 2 hydrogen atoms they are heavier then the combined helium atom so the exess mass gets released as energy or something like this
[2023-01-03 23:11:03] <%minizen> ^ i saw that
[2023-01-03 23:11:07] <Stoods_> Also, one of the main things with fusion reactors is that they need to produce tritium, since it is really hard to get tritium naturally
[2023-01-03 23:11:18] <%Narcotical> Job for future Waffle

[2023-01-03 23:12:53] <coolcake2> @Giantwaffle yes but they use H2 and H3 (deutirium and tritium)
[2023-01-03 23:12:59] <Wetware> Yep
[2023-01-03 23:13:00] <monepok> you use hydrogen atoms with extra neutrons
[2023-01-03 23:13:01] <%+ynneI> @Giantwaffle hydrogen is 1 proton. deuterium and tritium are hydrogen with extra neutrons
[2023-01-03 23:13:02] <Armathur> It exactly what the sun does
[2023-01-03 23:13:04] <dukeseven> all the way up to iron
[2023-01-03 23:13:05] <%$Venamah> fusion is the same process the sun does
[2023-01-03 23:13:10] <%+Gamernxc> sun is a giant fusion reactor
[2023-01-03 23:13:13] <+prairydog> mini sun :)
[2023-01-03 23:13:17] <Tapeman83> you're gonna be making deutirium and tritium in this pack YEP

[2023-01-03 23:14:11] <+Sam_1443> Scott Manley has a video on the fusion laser breathrough that came out 2 weeks ago that is great
[2023-01-03 23:14:11] <coolcake2> Hydrogen with an extra neutron (or an isotope) is deutriium
[2023-01-03 23:14:16] <+stickman_02> good thing time is all relative so youre still doing this in 2 weeks
[2023-01-03 23:14:18] <The_Holas> Deuterium is Hydrogen with extra neutron

[2023-01-03 23:26:54] <CareBear_1643> @Sui_Ume the onyl reason they stopped is cuz of pati's pc
[2023-01-03 23:26:54] <+PragmaticThoth> no emitters >:(
[2023-01-03 23:27:02] <davethulhu> level emitters killed his cow

[2023-01-03 23:27:20] <+dennis3833> u should turn the enderperls back on, already dropped by 3k enderperls

[2023-01-03 23:27:25] <+DrYProtoss> where did the level emitters touch you
[2023-01-03 23:27:26] <+Gotizie> just make a storage drive for each item then lol

[2023-01-03 23:27:36] <%$Jolle450> A level emitter cheated on his drawer controller.
[2023-01-03 23:27:38] <Smileynator> there needs to be better ways to interface with stuff without setup being jank :P
[2023-01-03 23:27:39] <Amraki> emitters suck because you never remember to scale quantity as you progress
[2023-01-03 23:27:43] <Sui_Ume> @CareBear_1643 I mean if they caused problems to pati now, pretty sure they will cause lag to waffle later too
[2023-01-03 23:28:01] <+Face_32> drawers get laggy when you start getting large amounts of stacks in them
[2023-01-03 23:28:12] <Amraki> *time* killed his pc

[2023-01-03 23:38:43] <$kidgrim2001_> Kappa200 you’ve probably moved on by now but fusion makes energy because the 2 atoms don’t add all their mass and the excess mass is turned to heat which evaporates water and then turns a turbine so basically 1+1 = 1.75 and the .25 is turned to heat

[2023-01-03 23:41:05] <kane1941> you gonna need millions of each metal by latest tiers, at least setup drawers instead of interfaces
[2023-01-03 23:41:22] <kypudo> just output to drawers, and storage bus on drawers, so you always have 2048 items. If u want less, you can downgrade. Then you don't have level emitters
[2023-01-03 23:41:23] <+Koeckie> you can make a extra room for it
[2023-01-03 23:41:46] <%DaemonSzyman> So... it sounds like you need passive autocrafting
