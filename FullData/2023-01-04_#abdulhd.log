[2023-01-04 13:26:27] <@%+Mr_Madic_HD> Head cheese or brawn is a cold cut terrine or meat jelly that originated in Europe[where?]. It is made with flesh from the head of a calf or pig (less commonly a sheep or cow), typically set in aspic, and usually eaten cold, at room temperature, or in a sandwich. Despite its name the dish is not a cheese and contains no dairy products. The parts of the head used vary, and may include the tongue and sometimes the feet and heart but do not commonly include the brain, eyes or ears.
[2023-01-04 13:31:46] <@%+Mr_Madic_HD> In Belarusian, Russian, and Ukrainian cuisine, a meat aspic dish is called kholodets (Belarusian: —Ö–∞–ª–∞–¥–∑–µ—Ü [xalaÀàdÕ°z ≤…õtÕ°s]; Russian: —Ö–æ–ª–æ–¥–µ—Ü [x…ôl…êÀàd ≤ets]; Ukrainian: —Ö–æ–ª–æ–¥–µ—Ü—å [xoloÀàd…õts ≤] (listen); also written as holodetz outside these countries) derived from the word kholod meaning "cold". In some areas it is called studen' (—Å—Ç—É–¥–µ–Ω—å) or studenets (—Å—Ç—É–¥–µ–Ω–µ—Ü), derived from a different root with a similar meaning. The dish is part of winter holiday celebrations such as the traditional Russian

If you are not a subscriber and have a Twitch Turbo you won't see any ads on any twitch channel and still count into ad revenue for the streamer! So imagine how much you can support your favorite streamer just by having Turbo!! twitch.tv/turbo

[2023-01-04 16:25:29] <%TheStockportHatter1883> It will probably be backbenched for a bit since apparently they want to wipe the server in the coming weeks (which is not enough time to do all of P1). But I don't see them abandoning the work entirely. It'll probably be re-introduced in a few months by Eddie or something once the introductory phase of HC is over.

[2023-01-04 16:51:51] <%Tr1ckyTr1ck5t3rHD> so for those wanting to know what Jose Santanna did... he got took to hospital and he got asked what his name was (he'd just been arrested too) and told them to suck a dick then failed to talk after that while the doc was treating him as the Doc was trying to trigger him... so to avoid saying something that would get him in trouble he took himself out of the equation and stayed quite and apparently thats the failed RP cause he failed to speak ü§î

Dokha is a tobacco product, it consists of finely dried and shredded tobacco along with herbs and spices. It also has different levels depending on the person's liking! Badr uses the Hot version which is the strongest.

Badr uses the Hot version which is the strongest.

[2023-01-04 20:17:16] <%TheStockportHatter1883> When focusing on the main objectives, The Last of Us Part II is about 24 Hours in length. If you're a gamer that strives to see all aspects of the game, you are likely to spend around 42 Hours to obtain 100% completion.

[2023-01-04 23:27:24] <+bladetricks> very immersive for me also, and it gets to a point where you feel like it's ending but it continues on a fair bit, and I was so happy it did
