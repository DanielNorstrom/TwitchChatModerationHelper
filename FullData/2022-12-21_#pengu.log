[2022-12-21 15:41:42] <LuckyOphatistic> i hear it near tho lol
[2022-12-21 15:41:45] <Midru> There was a perfect audio
[2022-12-21 15:41:49] <%goonerpower4> heard that clearly on our end
[2022-12-21 15:41:49] <+mcnuggies7> I heard it

[2022-12-21 15:41:58] <+schmusemaus69> had no problems hearing it
[2022-12-21 15:41:59] <kelbands_> 😭😭 I heard it
[2022-12-21 15:41:59] <+Rezoanur> it sounded like it was ok
[2022-12-21 15:42:01] <%goonerpower4> Yeah swear
[2022-12-21 15:42:07] <brutalr6s> Lol
[2022-12-21 15:42:12] <%goonerpower4> Sounded close enough
[2022-12-21 15:42:15] <w4s2b1> lol
[2022-12-21 15:42:18] <+s1mpology> it was red on the screen too
[2022-12-21 15:42:21] <+mcnuggies7> I was like why r u not running away from it
[2022-12-21 15:42:22] <+Rezoanur> if it is red it will kill u
[2022-12-21 15:42:28] <%goonerpower4> I just assumed you heard in your headset that it was high but it sounded close enough
[2022-12-21 15:42:35] <brutalr6s> @mcnuggies7 same
[2022-12-21 15:42:53] <%goonerpower4> I mean if it went off you're close enough right? And in that tiny window id assume its close maybe. idk
[2022-12-21 15:42:53] <flynn2005> Has close proximity
[2022-12-21 15:42:56] <雷哥 (thunderfse)> That was loud penguFiine
[2022-12-21 15:42:57] <glaemoes> Can we see your stats for the season
[2022-12-21 15:43:00] <+mcnuggies7> I assumed u gave up and let it kill you lol
[2022-12-21 15:43:13] <+mcnuggies7> Maybe it’s your headphones
[2022-12-21 15:43:16] <kelbands_> Ranked 2.0 thoughts ?
[2022-12-21 15:43:23] <%ACER_fps> ye idk sound is so bad this season. there are many times no chance to hear steps
[2022-12-21 15:43:24] <+mcnuggies7> But in game and stream it’s clear
[2022-12-21 15:43:28] <Sledgeraxe1> is it possible to compete in diamond and up elo on a 60hz monitor?
[2022-12-21 15:43:46] <+mcnuggies7> Change headphones and watch the replay again and see if it sounds the same
[2022-12-21 15:43:47] <kelbands_> @sledgeraxe1 yes definitely

[2022-12-21 15:44:10] <tomo1703> HeyGuys
[2022-12-21 15:44:13] <brutalr6s> I wish
[2022-12-21 15:44:47] <+schmusemaus69> headset issue?
[2022-12-21 15:44:52] <kelbands_> 😭😭
[2022-12-21 15:45:01] <kaaZcouZ> It was placed in between the boxes
[2022-12-21 15:45:06] <+mcnuggies7> Maybe your team mate was talking and the sound bugged out in the headphones
[2022-12-21 15:45:13] <GOOD402420> watch the sledge kill u in theaters
[2022-12-21 15:45:21] <flynn2005> Thorns is pretty decent ngl
[2022-12-21 15:45:25] <tenkayxo> it was skill issue i think
[2022-12-21 15:45:39] <+juhasz2014> really unfortunate bug
[2022-12-21 15:45:41] <kelbands_> Was your thoughts on ranked 2.0 ?

[2022-12-21 15:47:14] <+FreddieN33> you can get champ with 60 wins and 180 loses
