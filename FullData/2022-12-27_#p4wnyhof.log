[2022-12-27 12:12:05] <%SU_Shadow> i have always considered hardcore, "noobcore" .  longer time to kill favors skill, short TTK favors camping and who shoots first, so "noobcore"
[2022-12-27 12:12:25] <%Kryvtex> Panwy, use the "XTEN Angel-40" sight for longshots. It tells you the distance, so you don't have to question whether it is a longshot, or chall too far, much faster

[2022-12-27 14:32:27] <%sirsweetpotato> it is way better then anything else I can get around here
[2022-12-27 14:32:31] <$wolw3rin3_tm> For sure, broth is definetly better
[2022-12-27 14:33:04] <High_Duty> if you wanna make most things from scratch it will take you a lot of time.
[2022-12-27 14:33:21] <%Radnex> of cause it is
[2022-12-27 14:33:42] <%sirsweetpotato> and the noodles is the easiest part for me cause I make pasta all the time

[2022-12-27 15:18:10] <+sintech1349> i like his rational approach to things thats why i ask here
[2022-12-27 15:19:03] <+sintech1349> i am kinda torn between the 4080 and 7900 xtx but considering the price drops from nvidia recently the 4080 becomes a bit more interesting than the amd one

[2022-12-27 15:20:21] <+sintech1349> i am team "best bang for the buck" :D
[2022-12-27 15:20:35] <%flimaas> sintech1349 the time the 4080 drops, the 7900xtx will drop the same amount
[2022-12-27 15:20:54] <+sintech1349> @flimaas you get a 4080 for 1350 right now and thats the same price as the 7900xtx
[2022-12-27 15:21:06] <chnkynnja> we dont need the last 3-5% performance

[2022-12-27 15:22:43] <+sintech1349> if you play RFC jax you can go for titan slayer cause he dont need to tank
[2022-12-27 15:23:27] <%flimaas> sintech1349 and depending on ur system a new power supply and so on
[2022-12-27 15:23:39] <+sintech1349> @flimaas doesnt matter

[2022-12-27 15:25:01] <+sintech1349> @flimaas buying a new one either way
[2022-12-27 15:25:36] <%flimaas> sintech1349 for you maybe. but in general you need one for the 4080. but not for the 7900xtx
[2022-12-27 15:26:03] <+sintech1349> @flimaas 4080 consumes the same amount of power as 7900 xtx

[2022-12-27 15:27:40] <%+Dockain> what the forecast for this game?
[2022-12-27 15:27:42] <%flimaas> sintech1349 but not the same pins. and since there a burned power cables.... not matter its the consumer fault or the supplier... the 4th gen is a no go.... and for a friend of mine who bought a pre build costum pc had this happend

[2022-12-27 15:28:30] <+sintech1349> @flimaas it happens to 95% because of shitty adapters and i go with a power cable from psu to gpu directly so no adapter

[2022-12-27 15:34:17] <%DrQSoul> hello mister @p4wnyhof
[2022-12-27 15:35:05] <%flimaas> sintech1349 its not the adapters fault. There where like PSU 3.0 melts, nvidia adapter melts and so on. And since nvidia uses two suppliers for there adpater, which uses different standards and the one melts on higher %... its all allone their fault. i mean we had 8pins for years as a standard and nothing happens LUL
[2022-12-27 15:35:53] <+sintech1349> @flimaas there were 3090ti that came with a 16 pin and nothing happened...you should watch GN video and see his results
