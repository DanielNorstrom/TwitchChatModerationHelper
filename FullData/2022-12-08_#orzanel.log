[2022-12-08 09:24:24] <@^Nightbot> Totally broken tank, it makes Defender look like a baby.More lower plate armor than Minotauro and super small turret weakspot.Good penetration with both standard and gold, decent dmg capability, kinda slowish.If you care about the game don't buy this tank as it will ruin T6-T10 matchmaking.

[2022-12-08 10:18:58] <@^Nightbot> Very annoying light tank, view range is kinda low, speed is good, gun handling is good but has crappy salvo shot which ruins the tank entirely. Can only hit close stationary targets or you need to yolo and circle enemies. Overall not worth it.
[2022-12-08 10:19:16] <puntziko> seems like his tracks absorbed the impact, you ctitted him

[2022-12-08 10:49:44] <@^Nightbot> Orza got the tank for 30K. Decent tank, very nice acceleration but no high top speed, nice turret armor, ok-ish gun handling, dispersion not very good on the move, decent pen with standard and gold, nice dmg potential, decent gun depression, mediocre moneymaker, average viewrange. Play it like a heavy using the turret, not so much flanking around and the lack of speed will not be a problem. Overall decent tank.

[2022-12-08 12:16:04] <@^Nightbot> Broken tank, very well armored. Will be another hulldown tank with no weakspots. Very mobile too for the armor it has, a lot of gun depression, gun is good and accurate because good velocity on shells, bad standard pen. You mostly play it like a single shot tank so forget about the autoloader part. Overall a broken tank that adds more to the no weakspot hulldown meta.

[2022-12-08 12:19:04] <@^Nightbot> Good tank, decent mobility, very nice dispersion on the gun, can even shoot on the move, average pen with normal and gold, good gun depression, good dpm with both guns, higher dpm gun seems situational while bigger gun seems a better choice most of the time, not the easiest tank to play as you create weakspots when you use gun depression, ok-ish at sidescraping too and carefull when pointing the gun down as it reveals weakspots.Good tank but requires a higher skill cap to master it.

[2022-12-08 12:29:05] <@^Nightbot> Orzy got this tank from Lootboxes. He is using vertical stabs, optics, vents for open maps. For city maps vertical stabs, hardening and vents. Derpiest tank ever, very unreliable gun but satisfying when it hits. Armor is decent, especially against t8 opponents, speed is average, very good gold AP pen. Overall a super derp tank, so treat it likewise.

[2022-12-08 12:48:33] <@^Nightbot> Broken tank, very well armored. Will be another hulldown tank with no weakspots. Very mobile too for the armor it has, a lot of gun depression, gun is good and accurate because good velocity on shells, bad standard pen. You mostly play it like a single shot tank so forget about the autoloader part. Overall a broken tank that adds more to the no weakspot hulldown meta.

[2022-12-08 12:55:39] <@^Nightbot> Good tank, decent mobility, very nice dispersion on the gun, can even shoot on the move, average pen with normal and gold, good gun depression, good dpm with both guns, higher dpm gun seems situational while bigger gun seems a better choice most of the time, not the easiest tank to play as you create weakspots when you use gun depression, ok-ish at sidescraping too and carefull when pointing the gun down as it reveals weakspots.Good tank but requires a higher skill cap to master it.
