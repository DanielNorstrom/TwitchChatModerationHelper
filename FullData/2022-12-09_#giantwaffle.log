[2022-12-09 15:51:25] <%TigerLuv> so I just listened to the end of the vod - he said he would start later, and possible stream longer

[2022-12-09 17:27:21] <%lange__> Agreed, old marvel is amazing. New marvel is kinda meh
[2022-12-09 17:27:21] <%DrHax_> Marvel just was TOO MUCH in too short of a time I think
[2022-12-09 17:27:22] <%+ZukotsuKiD> Star Wars is fine
[2022-12-09 17:27:23] <+Rio_duh> Andor is the best Star Wars story in many many years
[2022-12-09 17:27:25] <+Kudasauce> you haven't seen Andor?!
[2022-12-09 17:27:27] <+Puhtehdough> The recent TV shows are very good. You gotta watch them and then form an opinion
[2022-12-09 17:27:29] <+jmm548> this is a sequal tot he last game
[2022-12-09 17:27:30] <magenof> aint marvel the same as start wars these days? all regurgitated disney crap
[2022-12-09 17:27:31] <%0x4273> fallen order was a fun game even for a non star wars fan
[2022-12-09 17:27:34] <FlashfreezeBuddha> some of the star wars books are amzing but you gotta dig through a lot of mediocricy to find them
[2022-12-09 17:27:36] <%VrtniPatuljak> its dark souls with lightsaber, 2 great things
[2022-12-09 17:27:38] <%$Mandorake> @Nexhunter KOTOR, SWTOR, BF, etc

[2022-12-09 17:27:47] <BBQgril> ResidentSleeper
[2022-12-09 17:27:53] <+shadowoflight_> nah. with andor out, it just reinfoces how all the star wars movies were bad or mediocre, including the originals. andor and rogue one were so good
[2022-12-09 17:27:56] <TheeSouleater> Fallen order had really weird travel choices that ruined the experience for me
[2022-12-09 17:27:58] <%Warcry1000> Mandalorian and Andor were good, rest was meh
[2022-12-09 17:27:59] <%+forthereals> HE ARRIVED
[2022-12-09 17:28:00] <scratches16> oh shit, it's a sequel for fallen order
[2022-12-09 17:28:03] <@%+Nexhunter> SWTOR sucked and had to be completely revamped to make it less suck @Mandorake
[2022-12-09 17:28:07] <%VrtniPatuljak> @TheeSouleater huh?
[2022-12-09 17:28:08] <%$Mandorake> @Nexhunter boooo

[2022-12-09 17:28:14] <%DrHax_> I dont think anyone knows who the guy in the bacta tank is
[2022-12-09 17:28:15] <%Wynja> Such gatekeeping in these big franchises, trying to "force" fans of the original to like the entire franchise
[2022-12-09 17:28:17] <+Furiak> nobody knows who this is, it's a new story? other than the red head being the same protagonist
[2022-12-09 17:28:21] <BBQgril> who???

[2022-12-09 17:28:37] <JaegerPls> Nothing. It's done in one of the cinematics
[2022-12-09 17:28:37] <shankwolf> warm up time
[2022-12-09 17:28:37] <%Mr_Warsta> It was a technique that was used
[2022-12-09 17:28:38] <%+Tinselear> The with and Jedi both hate it
[2022-12-09 17:28:38] <%+MaxWeeman> Bc it is connsiders, EXTREMELY dishonourable
[2022-12-09 17:28:38] <+NerdNik> nothing. They do that at some point in some games YEP
[2022-12-09 17:28:38] <%DrHax_> yeah against the code afaik
[2022-12-09 17:28:38] <%DaemonSzyman> Some bullshit like "honour"
[2022-12-09 17:28:39] <+Docgalaad> it happened in the lore
[2022-12-09 17:28:40] <+jmm548> good guy code
[2022-12-09 17:28:41] <+Kudasauce> fuck code LUL
[2022-12-09 17:28:41] <+CrystalSmack> entertainment
[2022-12-09 17:28:43] <TheeSouleater> @vrtnipatuljak the running back to your ship at the end of the level was awful
[2022-12-09 17:28:45] <%DrHax_> thats what ive heard too
[2022-12-09 17:28:46] <%$Mandorake> no its just a plot hole
[2022-12-09 17:28:49] <+kaijubes> It happens
[2022-12-09 17:28:49] <headbang3rboogie> cooldown on the blade....
[2022-12-09 17:28:51] <SchnellBier> it takes long
[2022-12-09 17:28:52] <+Mujona> The Star Wars anime one-offs did that. The 6 episode specials.
[2022-12-09 17:28:53] <+WDForty> there's that, but also their swing will hit you if you tried that
[2022-12-09 17:28:54] <%VrtniPatuljak> Giantwaffle it actually used to be a technique but stopped being effective as jedi can predict the future
[2022-12-09 17:28:56] <+Kudasauce> the entire universe is a loophole
[2022-12-09 17:28:56] <+Rio_duh> Seems like the type of thing that would be in one of the SWTOR cinematics
[2022-12-09 17:28:58] <headbang3rboogie> it always takes time to 'grow' dramatically
[2022-12-09 17:28:58] <@%^Moobot> You can find Waffle's Youtube channel here - https://youtube.com/giantwaffle
[2022-12-09 17:28:58] <%+Askjong> We don't talk about that
[2022-12-09 17:28:58] <+Docgalaad> it happened many times
[2022-12-09 17:28:59] <PanelSol> the swing of the other sword XD
[2022-12-09 17:29:00] <+renewd> Sith are prideful. They like to beat the Jedi at their own game
[2022-12-09 17:29:02] <MediocreStream> Like blinking sabres would be OP
[2022-12-09 17:29:02] <%$Mandorake> Why not make a laser so long you can just poke them from far away
[2022-12-09 17:29:04] <%+BloodyLlama> Star Wars is full of loopholes and other nonsense
[2022-12-09 17:29:05] <%+forthereals> this is known as a plot hole
[2022-12-09 17:29:07] <Tamerlain> it takes long to get plasma to get hot
[2022-12-09 17:29:08] <%$Mandorake> everyone making up stuff
[2022-12-09 17:29:09] <%DrHax_> same reason why the jedi dont create more interesting weapons with the kyber crystals
[2022-12-09 17:29:13] <+Kudasauce> that's why Andor is so good - no fucking Jedi
[2022-12-09 17:29:13] <%Chilled_Voodoo> if it is just light why don't they just flail it around like a laser pointer? no blade mass\
[2022-12-09 17:29:19] <%+Apakawata> The kyber krystal shatters with overuse
[2022-12-09 17:29:20] <headbang3rboogie> fuck sabers, give me a blaster
[2022-12-09 17:29:23] <The_Holas> may not be instant but not sure
[2022-12-09 17:29:24] <+Sentinel1_9> @Giantwaffle you do that then whats stopping their swing from hitting you
[2022-12-09 17:29:25] <mahoraz> but how long is the cooldown before it can re-initiate?
[2022-12-09 17:29:30] <%VrtniPatuljak> TheeSouleater you did it wrong. all levels looped around and you'd end at the ship LUL
[2022-12-09 17:29:32] <%+MaxWeeman> @Giantwaffle or why dont they just use it as a poking stick that they point at someone then turn it one when in range. ez win
[2022-12-09 17:29:33] <$ピッザダディ (p1zzadaddy_)> Dune also got shown
[2022-12-09 17:29:41] <+Bloodknigh> The obligatory dual light saber shot
[2022-12-09 17:29:46] <WalrusPug> it looks like this game has more own identity and is not just a star wars dark souls, which is good
[2022-12-09 17:29:50] <TheAllelujah> All I am excited of is Armored Core. Been waiting for a new game for years.
[2022-12-09 17:29:52] <%DrHax_> force speed POGGIES
[2022-12-09 17:29:52] <TheeSouleater> @vrtnipatuljak pain pain pain. Rip

[2022-12-09 17:29:54] <%ImposterArchitect> There's a lightsaber style that uses that, Tràkata

[2022-12-09 17:29:59] <+Kudasauce> Dune Awakening teaser was pretty
[2022-12-09 17:30:02] <%Valanze80> Star Killer is still my favorite extended universe character
[2022-12-09 17:30:02] <Tsullly> music is goof
[2022-12-09 17:30:04] <Tsullly> good

[2022-12-09 17:30:08] <Tamerlain> 2 HANDER
[2022-12-09 17:30:08] <%DaemonSzyman> The last game was pretty damn good though
[2022-12-09 17:30:09] <%VrtniPatuljak> Giantwaffle jedi fight by sensing the future, you cant trick him like that
[2022-12-09 17:30:12] <headbang3rboogie> Disney making some bank
[2022-12-09 17:30:14] <%+Apakawata> Cross-hilt?
[2022-12-09 17:30:14] <%$Mandorake> he's using that weapon like it had more mass than any other sword
[2022-12-09 17:30:14] <%DX_Plates> I thought The Force games were fun. Not all-star or anything but entertaining at least.
