[2023-01-06 19:50:44] <%fryume> i think it depends on where you are, in Ru birthday is a big day but i usually go hang out somewhere
[2023-01-06 19:52:56] <%gallyfz> yeah here in the states it's pretty dependent on the person/family
[2023-01-06 19:54:43] <%tropicalshark> for sure, i'm usually just fine not doing much personally. a movie and dinner at most.  i'm actually doing soemthing this weekend for my bday sodaPog
