[2023-01-02 13:19:40] <%+Nicole> @rexasb8 Probably because its kinda noisy but a nice hype song. the best is also repetitive as well. Joe's voice is sorta annoying too. sounds like he's mocking you instead of rapping uhsHOLD

[2023-01-02 13:21:17] <%+Nicole> Empire State is just annoying because like I said too much airplay when it came out. The beat especially the damn piano assaults my ears then you have Alica yelling out of bounds in her Alto range.

[2023-01-02 16:57:57] <%farminatorhd> removing paid prio
[2023-01-02 16:57:59] <jojaha> koil added some more after that

[2023-01-02 17:00:40] <%+Sovereign_Doom> i think a lot of racers actually do a lot of RP but their RP is revolving around racing and getting into chases and stuff. the racing crews dont exist because of grinders
[2023-01-02 17:00:41] <!%Pons> Because of it being seasonal like, I plan on making a completely different/random character for the hardcore thing.
[2023-01-02 17:00:42] <SmartTechGuy> @uhSnow  • If you roleplay, you will be safe. Grinders are not. • By the sounds of it bans are not going to be a thing its just going to reduce your prio.  • The system is automatic?
[2023-01-02 17:00:45] <+BakinPacman> every second week you have new civs who are drug masters KEKW
[2023-01-02 17:00:49] <%Uf0s8mycat> @AnomanderRake__ it depends, the racing in 2.0 was great and wasnt sweaty. Which helped make it great and there was rp behind the scene consistently

[2023-01-02 17:02:40] <%smokebu> seasonal could also mean different parts of the map or mechanics get more focus

[2023-01-02 17:02:46] <+Crazith> yeah I like the long RP, stuff like Cerberus, Norman, Michael Simone
[2023-01-02 17:02:49] <%+SargeAngel> i worry what thisll do to pub
[2023-01-02 17:02:53] <%Magicpumkin7> 6 month season would allow long rp and opportunities to switch it up
[2023-01-02 17:02:54] <+RagingSantas> Personally long RP is good but hard to jump in and out of. You have to know too much which scares off new viewers

[2023-01-02 17:02:58] <HotCocoaGamer> ngl it would be funny if one season mike block is a gang banger and the next a cop
[2023-01-02 17:03:08] <@%jamm0302> we will see how it plays out tho
[2023-01-02 17:03:08] <+whiskeyInThejar_74> @Crazith windsong?
[2023-01-02 17:03:09] <+Heatst0rm> I think you can get a lot of stories done in 6 months. Rather than having stories with 10 different people you have stories with certain people every season
[2023-01-02 17:03:24] <top_pun> i think the timeline forces people to think about their RP choices
[2023-01-02 17:03:25] <+daemonchill> is a 6 month wipe gonna matter if people redo same exact groups though each time?
[2023-01-02 17:03:26] <%Bakemaan> 6 month arcs will be great.
[2023-01-02 17:03:30] <%Senna_Mynx> So it constantly give something for the Civs something to do
[2023-01-02 17:03:30] <+BakinPacman> 6 months is longer than people mean
[2023-01-02 17:03:31] <+midori96> good morning chat uhsLove
[2023-01-02 17:03:34] <!%Pons> @jamm0302 on the grander scale of things, 6 months is a long, long time, especially in terms of roleplay.
[2023-01-02 17:03:38] <PossiblyBri> I have a feeling cop numbers will plummit again for at least a month.
[2023-01-02 17:03:42] <isomeek> wonder how that will work with court cases etc
[2023-01-02 17:03:47] <%JerryTarantinoo> 6 months in rp time is a long time

[2023-01-02 17:04:04] <+Crazith> @whiskeyInThejar_74 missed that one, but CPD took like 8-9 months of build up
[2023-01-02 17:04:14] <eskimojoe2> Welp, poor nidas wil be out of a job cause it is never roleplay with that guy nidasOgey
[2023-01-02 17:04:16] <dafty> It would be interesting to tighten on the NVL and consequence aspect in terms of what people are doing and the choices they’re making.
[2023-01-02 17:04:16] <%Uf0s8mycat> some gang members who were a character in 2.0 have kind of become self inserts in 3.0 sadly
[2023-01-02 17:04:17] <CinnamonToastKen> ive become a self insert lately. im gross
[2023-01-02 17:04:18] <%flatmilkstain> Without grinders there would probably be no economy KEKW
[2023-01-02 17:04:19] <AnomanderRake__> Exactly. Grinder is not a self insert
[2023-01-02 17:04:22] <%+milkydeew> remove Rp'ers like the rx7 driver the other day
[2023-01-02 17:04:23] <+TorqueX> I just hope that full memory wipes won't have to happen. I think lore is important to roleplay, especially for long term characters.
[2023-01-02 17:04:23] <%Senna_Mynx> Grinders has gone the way of cringe and gaslighting NODDERS over used and lost all meaning

[2023-01-02 17:04:46] <hakz5> There’s so much RP that goes on around “grinders”
[2023-01-02 17:04:46] <SmartTechGuy> Grinders are somewhat necessary
[2023-01-02 17:04:48] <+FutaSnek> Some grindrs have great RP

[2023-01-02 17:04:59] <CinnamonToastKen> haha ven moreso i guess
[2023-01-02 17:05:00] <+RagingSantas> Alot of the grinders are people just looking to RP with. Doesn't mean they're bad at rp
[2023-01-02 17:05:00] <+Region_8> self inserts will grind boosts and banks and then call sani workers grinders
[2023-01-02 17:05:00] <%+mantequillahehexd> @daemonchill bjorn is awesome

[2023-01-02 17:05:03] <Luthlane> every1 has to grind
[2023-01-02 17:05:13] <OminousVigil> Didnt the grinder stigma come from the oxy grinders?
[2023-01-02 17:05:14] <Tur4no> IMO this 6 month thing will force the slow rp to be content based not rp based
[2023-01-02 17:05:16] <+BakinPacman> flippy kept the economy running by keeping the mats in check LUL
[2023-01-02 17:05:18] <%d3ltaf0x> Gbaby for exemple does Both
[2023-01-02 17:05:18] <+MediHomiPoni> think about the bench man, grinding out those benches and RP
[2023-01-02 17:05:19] <Lusfolgen> Most of the HOA are grinders
[2023-01-02 17:05:19] <+daemonchill> and some people just find that stuff fun
[2023-01-02 17:05:30] <%Uf0s8mycat> I did so many pawn runs grinding away. But the purpose wasnt money, it was connections. Theres more to it
[2023-01-02 17:05:34] <%$Kilrathal> KEKW
[2023-01-02 17:05:34] <%+TheLordR3D> 6 month wipe rotations will probably bring back more grinding, which is good. Too many billionaires around right now lol
[2023-01-02 17:05:35] <+Heatst0rm> For me self-inserts was always an excuse for people not to come up with a background story and depths to a characters and I will keep thinking like that

[2023-01-02 17:05:49] <%+VoidedZReaper> Grinders are the backbone of stable econs in many servers inside and outside of RP
[2023-01-02 17:05:51] <+rF1ix> I grind for a certain amount of hours Monday to Friday then role play and have fun on weekends
[2023-01-02 17:05:58] <HotCocoaGamer> i do wonder if the reset entails losing your business or maybe your business becoming something else.
[2023-01-02 17:06:02] <SmartTechGuy> You needed the grinders for the materials to make recipes
[2023-01-02 17:06:06] <+cantankerously> Dab was a bit of a grinder in 2.0

[2023-01-02 17:06:23] <%$Fennomania> Jenny hall is millionaire because she grinds like 12 jobs (most off screen) but no one with clear conscience would call Nikki bad roleplayer

[2023-01-02 17:07:01] <+Heatst0rm> Grinders can roleplay their progression. Make deals with their grind of materials. Establish connections to clients who need it. It's just an action it does not represent the character itself
