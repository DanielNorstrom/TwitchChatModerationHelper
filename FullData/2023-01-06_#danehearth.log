[2023-01-06 17:28:13] <Bleckotta> @danehearth found only one right movement tutorial... when you make "circle" with mouse... the thing you are doing is moving your models feet around your vertical body axes to get momentum for acceleration... like football kick,.. when you then strafe jump you put on top of that another acceleration from side and forward movement keys pressed together.. easy vector magic.. but look ingame how movement is explained on picture :D Almost no new guy have speedometer turned on...

[2023-01-06 19:30:04] <+phil___nye> @danehearth I did a variation of your DR Rogue deck with Rotten Rodent, but lower curve. One is an aggro deck with undertaker, the other is more of an OTK but uses low cost burn with scourge illusionist to make 0-cost copies for Umbra
[2023-01-06 19:30:12] <+phil___nye> Both have been working pretty well

[2023-01-06 19:34:51] <+phil___nye> I think the hardest matchup I've run into so far is Even Shaman. Devolve and Splitting axe are so nasty for both
[2023-01-06 19:35:15] <+phil___nye> But the OTK deck uses AoE DR so that makes the matchup significantly better
[2023-01-06 19:35:39] <Ffritser> oops, no elephant
[2023-01-06 19:35:51] <%davidmcg> gank
[2023-01-06 19:35:56] <%davidmcg> he was confused
