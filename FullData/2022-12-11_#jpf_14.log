[2022-12-11 12:01:15] <krishxnaik> yeah it was an interesting situation
[2022-12-11 12:01:34] <1zakash> what type of cars are s++
[2022-12-11 12:01:40] <maikyy96> did u see the confo koil and summit had about s++?
[2022-12-11 12:01:42] <krishxnaik> yep
[2022-12-11 12:02:03] <krishxnaik> preston was doing it all day
[2022-12-11 12:02:17] <!%daarth_odyssey> probably need to drop off multiple s+ cars to reach s++
[2022-12-11 12:02:17] <krishxnaik> was like fuck it mentality
[2022-12-11 12:02:23] <oolliivveerr123> I know he f8 quit in a situation the other day about the car
[2022-12-11 12:02:33] <+lbarrett96> I mean if they just went in there no reason is it not private property technically KEKW I mean tbf if they knew and had reason its fair game for the cops. depends tho
[2022-12-11 12:02:39] <xxuranium7xx> @oolliivveerr123 who?
[2022-12-11 12:02:44] <krishxnaik> yep
[2022-12-11 12:02:50] <Elgid2000> wiseguy basically told what S++ going to be

[2022-12-11 12:03:24] <krishxnaik> its rough cause judd was asleep
[2022-12-11 12:03:36] <Ahmad_Karam> https://youtu.be/-QCt3l_7B5A CG vs Cops
[2022-12-11 12:03:36] <blair63> Was this yesterday? Cops were doing PD Olympics yesterday and got Extra points for securing valuable vins
[2022-12-11 12:03:39] <deathreaper361> so is jay joining the war against suarez than @jpf_14
[2022-12-11 12:03:40] <xxuranium7xx> "shoot this fool" Summit kills me LUL
[2022-12-11 12:03:49] <krishxnaik> yep thats what happened
[2022-12-11 12:03:51] <+lbarrett96> I mean if they didnt know it was vin scratch, its an illegal seizure KEKW Dont know context though
[2022-12-11 12:03:56] <!%daarth_odyssey> whats the new recoil like?
[2022-12-11 12:04:02] <krishxnaik> and the series of events got a bit worse
[2022-12-11 12:04:02] <%J_Trickz246> S++ will be between 15-20 City cars as the T 20 and such that will be 1-1 Vins that are not allowed to be converted
[2022-12-11 12:04:05] <!%daarth_odyssey> isnt it very bad for most guns
[2022-12-11 12:04:12] <%+gr_eggs123> PD OLYMPICS
[2022-12-11 12:04:13] <krishxnaik> they crushed it mid shootout
[2022-12-11 12:04:19] <maikyy96> u gotta aim now
[2022-12-11 12:04:20] <!%daarth_odyssey> makes sense
[2022-12-11 12:04:21] <Ahmad_Karam> they made it better
[2022-12-11 12:04:25] <+EuanW04> i’m surprised he left the scratch out tbh
[2022-12-11 12:04:31] <gd023> tap tap
[2022-12-11 12:04:35] <krishxnaik> so like crims had no chance to save it
[2022-12-11 12:04:45] <%Braden69Lol> https://youtu.be/hfj0A9Or9FU
[2022-12-11 12:04:47] <maikyy96> as if they come to the block and random take a vin
[2022-12-11 12:04:52] <+chrlie7> he went to sleep too
[2022-12-11 12:04:55] <+chrlie7> wasnt even online...

[2022-12-11 12:06:23] <+lbarrett96> Tbf id imagine that cop will get strike points for it. Even though it was a vin scratch they broke the law to get it
[2022-12-11 12:06:23] <maikyy96> kill them when they try to come in
[2022-12-11 12:06:34] <%+siippzz> @IS2K00 sk did

[2022-12-11 12:07:03] <%+keasty> @J_Trickz246 yeh they were having convos on how to make sure people lose them, like PM takes them back if u don't race them and shit, and said there will be lots, but u can only have 1 at a time

[2022-12-11 13:43:16] <%HotShotScottt> should record the raciing you do off stream for videos
[2022-12-11 13:43:24] <%ikky_0> And boost aswell
[2022-12-11 13:43:43] <owensquire123> Maybe record your races when your off stream
[2022-12-11 13:43:46] <%osqaar13> Ngl i think u should post on yt your NA races when you’re not streaming, ofc if you want to
[2022-12-11 13:43:53] <%emilyisme8> Pog

[2022-12-11 13:45:09] <wagnandez> and put a VCB counter on it or VCB timer. Gives you a challenge i guess
[2022-12-11 13:45:10] <idavak> you should post it when you and the boys took the police car and drove it for like 40 min

[2022-12-11 15:18:40] <krishxnaik> I mean my opinion is that you shouldnt know the whole process of completing a heist before even trying it
[2022-12-11 15:18:42] <%+xjettie_> yeah Hebrew new years is september-october ish
[2022-12-11 15:18:56] <Maaz_Da_G> @krollo6 i mean he's using his connections, can't blame him tbf

[2022-12-11 15:21:46] <Maaz_Da_G> @krollo6 he's in a gang where he's pushing progression, if no one else ddoes it consisteentley, who will?
[2022-12-11 15:21:55] <krishxnaik> like the process of doing the heist is a puzzle in itself
[2022-12-11 15:22:08] <krishxnaik> disregarding the hacks
[2022-12-11 15:22:10] <krollo6> @krollo6 exactly y jaylen denied james cuz he wants mdm to figure shit out by themselves like every other gang did
[2022-12-11 15:23:00] <%abinator2345> matt wants that spoonfeed
[2022-12-11 15:23:01] <threedoggo> i mean they didnt figure it out Randy was on the phone guiding them to finish it sooo
[2022-12-11 15:23:17] <d3wn> @threedoggo but they did it, he offering same thing
[2022-12-11 15:23:20] <safwan792> james said he will do that
[2022-12-11 15:23:24] <+Toasty_Turkey> @krollo6 Dude not disagreeing that matt is a bit of a speed runner but no gang fully figured it out themselves soooo
[2022-12-11 15:24:15] <threedoggo> @d3wn yea and its calm i do think MDM should atleast attempt it by themselves blind atleast once
