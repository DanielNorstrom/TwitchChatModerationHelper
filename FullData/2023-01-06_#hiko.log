[2023-01-06 18:32:00] <+holdmyqualls> going througth door is such a risk because it closes behind you and would have a hard time retreating
[2023-01-06 18:32:06] <%+hannahtms> @michaelangelosama i think astra would be good on this map

[2023-01-06 19:30:51] <+fen_> @Theboss4232 nossy
[2023-01-06 19:30:51] <TatariTV> Summary: Shots 1-5: Clearly missed. Shots 6-9: Missed due to recoil (bad spray control). Shots 10-11: Very close, but recoil and inaccuracy make these reasonable misses. Shot 12: Likely didn't actually fire because Hiko was already dead.

[2023-01-06 20:42:19] <+RealD0naldDuck> Shots 1-5: Clearly missed. Shots 6-9: Missed due to recoil (bad spray control). Shots 10-11: Very close, but recoil and inaccuracy make these reasonable misses. Shot 12: Likely didn't actually fire because Alex was already dead.

[2023-01-06 22:02:29] <@%^Fossabot>* Summary: Shots 1-5: Clearly missed. Shots 6-9: Missed due to recoil (bad spray control). Shots 10-11: Very close, but recoil and inaccuracy make these reasonable misses. Shot 12: Likely didn't actually fire because Hiko was already dead.
