[2022-12-09 15:42:56] <%AngelAyline> I mean it could be one of 3 problems that I can see. Mono Stero Audio issue, Wearing it backwards which I doubt and Synapse/BT issues

[2022-12-09 16:02:30] <%AngelAyline> Sym basically gains ammo from shields now again, she has her max beam faster and holds it longer before it goes down. It's really nice. I love Sym now again

[2022-12-09 17:48:14] <@%Grimstab77> So the matchmaker cannot find a connection to those servers and find you other servers and match you with ppl from that region
[2022-12-09 17:48:20] <+pyromana192> So i can go into Eu servers if im in us for example?
[2022-12-09 17:48:23] <@%Grimstab77> @Awasd999 that's the only way to do it
[2022-12-09 17:48:23] <@%zyron999> @Grimstab77 But you still connect to the game and it gives you the auto ban. I know people that did that before. He didn't lose SR, but he's get the 15 minute bans for DC

[2022-12-09 17:49:51] <@%Grimstab77> @zyron999 I used to block west coast servers EU and MEA servers to play on NA EST servers. It always worked perfectly
[2022-12-09 17:50:09] <@%zyron999> Hmm, maybe you did it a diff. way than the people I saw do it
[2022-12-09 17:50:28] <Awasd999> @Grimstab77 so as a analogy, you basically shut off all the pipes that has the flow you don't like so the refiner doesn't have the option to use said flow from the pipe
[2022-12-09 17:50:39] <@%Grimstab77> yeah

[2022-12-09 17:51:52] <@%Grimstab77> that's how you do it. Because blizzard doesn't care about your region. It's looking to give you the servers with the best ping for everyone. So it will try to drag you towards the closest servers to you. However, if you block those servers, the matchmaker has a ping timeout on those servers and cannot get you into a lobby
