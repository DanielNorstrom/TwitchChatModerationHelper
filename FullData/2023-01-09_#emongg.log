[2023-01-09 14:16:05] <@%^StreamElements> If you're noticing ads at unfortunate times, Twitch now requires all streams to run ads at set intervals. We're not triggering them, they're on Twitch's end and out of our control.

[2023-01-09 14:20:45] <Hanni_Extra> @mario98747 that's too easy, 100 kills is achievable in 5 games. I like that the titles are not something you can get instantly

[2023-01-09 14:24:13] <Hanni_Extra> @mario98747 I don't see how that's a bad thing. If I get to keep this title then it will be really cool in 2 years since people will be like "oh wow they got this really old title that required a lot of effort to get"
[2023-01-09 14:24:15] <Bythisgirl> good morning
[2023-01-09 14:24:16] <PratishSungum> Uncomfortable amount of pressure on the single tank
[2023-01-09 14:24:16] <fishstick2793> are you playin with the gang today?
[2023-01-09 14:24:17] <FaIgarth> I've been hard stuck bronze for years (my aim is trash) and it's kinda like being in a Chucky E Cheese full of unsupervised 7yr olds. You never really know what's going to happen. Will the form a single file line and walk through a choke to their death, or will they all run away from fights? Still the most fun I've had playing a game in years.
[2023-01-09 14:24:22] <cyromarley> what time do you start playing some games <3

[2023-01-09 14:25:30] <PlatOnMyMain> in all seriousness how do you feel about the current event? I came from OW1 and am not really all enthused  not because i have the skin but because it wasnt really anything enticing for a FFADM since i usually just play comp honestly. idk the events havent really hit me since the OG events original releases

[2023-01-09 14:29:01] <PlatOnMyMain> I feel like the people from OW1 are upset that since we are veterans we are being left out of the feel of new people that are experiencing OW for the first time and instead of feeling what they are we are being treated as the red headed child metaphorically

[2023-01-09 14:31:56] <LindseyMonroe> Ive dva to counter hog and works well for me.
[2023-01-09 14:31:56] <Jezriah> i dont mind the one shot with hog... you have to hook, shoot, and punch to kill.  that takes skill. in my opinion.

[2023-01-09 14:34:03] <NekoSenTV_> Yes, I have to get 2 golden weapons but it won't let me get them and I don't know if there is a bug in this season

[2023-01-09 14:34:04] <DonBlobby> i think it’s a combination of hog’s one shot, his insane survivability, as well as his crazy dps with his gun that makes him not fun to play against
[2023-01-09 14:34:13] <Jok3rsWild003> @killallzombies03 wait to fortify once ur armor is almost gone
[2023-01-09 14:34:19] <ghorrin> I just dont see how its fair for a tank to be able to heal itself, have 600? health and can one shot

[2023-01-09 14:36:45] <%+tm_901> heavily nerf widow railgun charge speed, seems like an easy fix to me
[2023-01-09 14:36:46] <+darklord1061> i feel like sojourn, bastion, reaper widow are all good against hog,  you basically just need high dps and to do twice his health bar in the time of his cooldown whilst avoiding getting hooked
[2023-01-09 14:36:46] <lex_xiexie> how do i counter roadhog with jq more effectively / efficiently? @Emongg
[2023-01-09 14:36:46] <%BushkaPlays> anything to look forward to in season 3?
[2023-01-09 14:36:49] <+jcole2002> @PlatOnMyMain yea anna a huge counter obviously, maybe mei if its a team fight and u can jump the hog

[2023-01-09 14:37:57] <PlatOnMyMain> @BushkaPlays BRUH I LOOOOOOVE anti as anna a hog b4 he heals KEKW that salt is real
[2023-01-09 14:38:02] <+darklord1061> no i think ow2 playerbase is still pretty strong
[2023-01-09 14:38:02] <Enrico_Polatso2> @p3l000 far from it
[2023-01-09 14:38:11] <%Hotrodzman> My thoughts on the queen buffs are that they won’t be as impactful until hog and sojourn nerfs then she will feel really good
[2023-01-09 14:38:19] <%$phlox_mage> just happy emongWiggle
[2023-01-09 14:38:19] <+000dk> just pick dva and matrix all hooks

[2023-01-09 14:39:49] <+darklord1061> cant get rid of hog's heal completely it's his only sustain, easiest way to nerf it is to up the cooldown
[2023-01-09 14:39:49] <%+tm_901> heavily nerf sojourn railgun charge speed, seems like an easy fix to me
[2023-01-09 14:40:00] <tomboukj> no 11th till 25

[2023-01-09 14:41:04] <eboxgator> aren’t they reworking brig
[2023-01-09 14:41:06] <khufoo12345> tbh i think hog is broken so they should nerf genji
[2023-01-09 14:41:09] <m7vp> Do u think junkrat needs a nurf ?
[2023-01-09 14:41:10] <bluelabrador> I don’t have a legendary for Moira, but Moira is just…you know

[2023-01-09 14:41:35] <Kivmbre> thekineWingman
[2023-01-09 14:41:36] <%+tm_901> just make it charge slower
[2023-01-09 14:41:38] <%Hotrodzman> I wasn’t sure sorry. I know they announced hog figured if anyone would know it’s you hahaha
[2023-01-09 14:41:39] <+darklord1061> not sure if brig needs a rework, she works just needs a buff on stats, the extra sheild already helps a bit
[2023-01-09 14:41:40] <ChillySummerMist> they need reduce jq hitbox size. it's ridiculously large.
[2023-01-09 14:41:43] <117adam> it shouldn't headshot and reduce it's hitbox at 100 charge
[2023-01-09 14:41:46] <sm1leFTW> they should try deleting the character :)

[2023-01-09 14:42:33] <+notorious_cid> Why don't they just revert the change they made at the beginning of the game that made it way easier to headshot?
[2023-01-09 14:42:36] <almost_addictive> moira pee counts as a weapon heal

[2023-01-09 15:09:44] <Enrico_Polatso2> i feel like they should give enough coins to give 1 free legendary if you already have the skin the provide but thats just me
[2023-01-09 15:09:45] <cyromarley> yeah definitely agreee

[2023-01-09 15:11:36] <lex_xiexie> i wish hanzo was in this event
[2023-01-09 15:11:54] <lex_xiexie> make him eros
[2023-01-09 15:11:56] <+darklord1061> i think rein and widow are the best in this event
[2023-01-09 15:12:07] <%JustSwufty> multiple Lucio and Pharah in this is soo annoyingg
[2023-01-09 15:12:11] <+darklord1061> pharrah is pretty good too

[2023-01-09 15:12:54] <dabwang> pharah shouldnt have been in this event, she alone makes it a lot un fun

[2023-01-09 15:14:14] <DonBlobby> lucio is kinda crazy on this gamemode
[2023-01-09 15:14:16] <$talon824> @darklord1061 Rein and widow are two of the worst… Pharah queen Lucio and hog are definitely top 4

[2023-01-09 15:15:07] <itsLxxBS> Use your ult as often as you can, don't wait. Then just go around and find the 3 ult chargies

[2023-01-09 15:16:36] <itsLxxBS> I'm by no means amazing at this game - but the JQ challenge took me around an hour and a half. Pretty quick to grind once you think about it a bit!... Always be on ult, basically don't bother with fights unless they're close to final shot, or if it's a squishy pharah/widow/lucio just ape them.. There's basically always a 300hp pack near the charge boosts as well.
[2023-01-09 15:16:41] <PlatOnMyMain> @Enrico_Polatso2 like i feel like they could have done more for the event just like the Christmas one. Idk i feel a bit let down and seeing something that is rushed just to shape the new comers to mild to little effort of events and basically throwing veterans under the rug of course

[2023-01-09 15:18:42] <itsLxxBS> It's so easy once you work it out.. Just farm ult, and play sombra-style and only take the low picks.. Y'all got this
[2023-01-09 15:18:43] <$talon824> @darklord1061 There’s 3 for 8 players, and widow has the least health, so least likely to survive any skirmish to take the boost

[2023-01-09 15:19:04] <lex_xiexie> its actually kinda sad how seaosn 3 wont include new heroes

[2023-01-09 15:20:25] <AlvaroQN98> endorsing others helps them get a better level and thus free Battle Pass XP every once in a while
[2023-01-09 15:20:26] <Enrico_Polatso2> i really hope season 3's battle pass is good
[2023-01-09 15:20:27] <%+EfnMD> Do we really need new heroes every other season ?
[2023-01-09 15:20:27] <Type_etoile> who do you think would be the next BPass Skins?
[2023-01-09 15:20:29] <PlatOnMyMain> @Emongg is it in unison or seperate?
[2023-01-09 15:20:37] <$talon824> @lex_xiexie That was just a fan engagement stream, not the actual map
[2023-01-09 15:20:38] <%Hotrodzman> When they do a new hero what class do you think it will be?
[2023-01-09 15:20:40] <lex_xiexie> @Enrico_Polatso2 hope so too, they really need to fix it
[2023-01-09 15:20:43] <+darklord1061> @talon824 @talon824 you'll be surprised how often people leave the charge pick ups though, alot of the time all of the fighting is all on one end of the map leaving the other ones free
[2023-01-09 15:20:43] <chandeloore> I heard that the next heroes will be supports? since there are so few of them compared to the other roles.
[2023-01-09 15:20:49] <%+LeonInhalesQuickly> Least favorite hero?
[2023-01-09 15:20:49] <Enrico_Polatso2> @Hotrodzman i think they said 2 supports are next
[2023-01-09 15:20:52] <%JustSwufty> They should lowkey turn Brit until a support
[2023-01-09 15:20:55] <%+tm_901> too close to the edge STRESS
[2023-01-09 15:20:57] <%+mirel1983> Overwatch is dead to me until we get at least 3 new support classes. So if we get 1 new hero every other season, i'll be back to playing in 2025
[2023-01-09 15:20:58] <lex_xiexie> @talon824 that's sadge
[2023-01-09 15:21:01] <itsLxxBS> @JustSwufty Right! Just a bit of thinking to do.. Should encourage new players to start focusing the squishies and low health enemies during actual team battles too - it's like a subtle way to train people to pick better in my eyes

[2023-01-09 15:33:50] <Crosis86> competitive ctf isnt terrible tho lol
[2023-01-09 15:33:53] <$talon824> I hope Junker Queen gets the statue coz she’s fun to play. She’s fairly strong in the mode, but fair. Not Lucio into ow1 brig, or Pharah playing out of the range of everyone else
[2023-01-09 15:33:55] <DonBlobby> 300…
[2023-01-09 15:33:57] <Kevtaru> god I can't wait lol

[2023-01-09 15:34:03] <%Hotrodzman> Was cft that big of a demand
[2023-01-09 15:34:03] <AlvaroQN98> to be fair, they are way quicker
[2023-01-09 15:34:08] <mixer_wolf3835> Nah that’s crazy
[2023-01-09 15:34:13] <$talon824> There’s like no playerbase

[2023-01-09 15:34:57] <%+EfnMD> I went 7-2 in comp and only went up 1 rank. New ranked feels gross

[2023-01-09 15:35:15] <%+tm_901> does it work the other way, if you get high MMR in CTF will you climb in ranked
[2023-01-09 15:35:18] <imf33lin1t> thank god emongg is streaming ..... yes! maybe work won't be so bad today

[2023-01-09 15:35:53] <Enrico_Polatso2> tbh im waiting until season 3 to play comp, waiting for hog to not dominate the meta
[2023-01-09 15:35:54] <redkakti> @P01S0N_IV i thought it is maybe i was hiding from ulting widow as ram too much KEKW i can understand it in this mode but it should not transfer to normal games
[2023-01-09 15:35:55] <lex_xiexie> ctf is so loud hearing "your team has dropped the flag" like every 10 seconds
[2023-01-09 15:36:06] <Enrico_Polatso2> the main thing i fear is that after the hog nerf orisa dosnt get nerfed
[2023-01-09 15:36:14] <+MakshaTheRaven> tank q is crazy
[2023-01-09 15:36:15] <qkilll> I wann see people who thought Ramatra was going be the worst tank when he know is the best tank before roaf

[2023-01-09 15:36:39] <+darknessredefine> seeing more orisa everywhere
[2023-01-09 15:36:39] <$talon824> I haven’t touched it this season, so I’ve been seeing people try out Junker Queen
[2023-01-09 15:36:41] <%+tm_901> hog first, then one switches orisa, then both orisa
[2023-01-09 15:36:43] <sleepibunz> Orisa and Hog lmao
[2023-01-09 15:36:47] <+MakshaTheRaven> any tank orisa counters you know of?
[2023-01-09 15:36:48] <+DarkHeartsKing> if i play overwatch on console...does all my stuff cross over to PC?
[2023-01-09 15:36:50] <imf33lin1t> orisa
[2023-01-09 15:36:58] <redkakti> @DarkHeartsKing ywa
[2023-01-09 15:37:00] <PlatOnMyMain> so in gold its hyper dependent in maps honestly like og maps hog newer  maps deff orisa
[2023-01-09 15:37:02] <chandeloore> I prefer playing orisa over hog
[2023-01-09 15:37:05] <+cassrawk> Who is a good counter for Ram??
[2023-01-09 15:37:06] <redkakti> @DarkHeartsKing yes
[2023-01-09 15:37:11] <catchysaucer66> i think sigma is gonna be good after hog nerf
[2023-01-09 15:37:12] <sleepibunz> I’ve been a little jump in JQ tho
[2023-01-09 15:37:12] <firekingdarklordruler> Question what are your current thoughts ramattra
[2023-01-09 15:37:13] <thearsosquad> I usually see orisa more but when orisa doesn't work they switch to hog
[2023-01-09 15:37:14] <+darknessredefine> @makshatheraven Winston
[2023-01-09 15:37:15] <StickkCS> pretty much 80% of my plat/diamond queue is some combo of orisa and hog
[2023-01-09 15:37:16] <+darklord1061> i'm playing alot of orisa too tbf
[2023-01-09 15:37:17] <+DarkHeartsKing> Thank you :)
[2023-01-09 15:37:17] <AlvaroQN98> yeah she needs to
[2023-01-09 15:37:23] <zarall> good counter to zarya?
[2023-01-09 15:37:23] <Crosis86> after playing that event mode stuff, do you think pharah should be able to move while using her ulti? cause i dont think shed be broken if she could
[2023-01-09 15:37:27] <%$P01S0N_IV> @P01S0N_IV i hope it dont transfer peepoS  else i just wasted 20 $ on a skin that i will never use again KEKWait
[2023-01-09 15:37:28] <%+999Clipped> mostly Orisia Hog and Sigma
[2023-01-09 15:37:29] <catchysaucer66> can sigma rock counter rammatra block?
[2023-01-09 15:37:30] <qkilll> Road needs huge nerf
[2023-01-09 15:37:32] <Enrico_Polatso2> id be excited for a ramattra meta
[2023-01-09 15:37:39] <FrozenEmotionz> hog gets countered by ana too
[2023-01-09 15:37:40] <sinfulbore> yes @catchysaucer66

[2023-01-09 15:38:00] <%+999Clipped> i much rather fight an orisa than a hog
[2023-01-09 15:38:00] <%+tm_901> what breaks ramm block? hack?
[2023-01-09 15:38:03] <$talon824> @catchysaucer66 It forces him out but he can block again once the stun ends
[2023-01-09 15:38:06] <zarall> thanks
[2023-01-09 15:38:07] <+niaskal> Getting ult charge with breather is just ridiculous...
[2023-01-09 15:38:08] <Enrico_Polatso2> ramattra has been one of the most fun and fair tanks imo
[2023-01-09 15:38:19] <$talon824> @tm_901 Any stun or wait it out

[2023-01-09 15:46:05] <%TheGreekSpeedster> at least they don't have hog

[2023-01-09 15:46:17] <Assaf_a1Harbi> Soujron is good but if the mercy pockets her and boosts damage then she can be a problem
[2023-01-09 15:46:20] <+aaymon86> Ngl, pocketing Soujorns is kinda cringe.

[2023-01-09 16:03:29] <rktwobbuffet> @isaachendon ranks are lower when you first place I think, you have to "re-earn" you're actual rank. I may be wrong, I haven't played comp much

[2023-01-09 16:04:45] <+hd3ck> can anyone let me know a situation when you would want to cancel gold?

[2023-01-09 16:05:24] <doopadelphia> @outlawolf_ only time i think is if you pop it to get out of sig ult or somthing but dont need it to live otherwise and want to trigger the cooldown asap
[2023-01-09 16:05:28] <lex_xiexie> @999Clipped probably when fight's over and u wanna get gold cooldown faster for next fight
[2023-01-09 16:05:29] <vincyboy9602> U would cancel gold for hog ult
[2023-01-09 16:05:31] <SpookyAzul> canceling fortify is a good idea if there is an enemy hog using ult :)
[2023-01-09 16:05:34] <+niaskal> and there's no downside being gold...?
[2023-01-09 16:05:35] <+darklord1061> @hd3ck if after you win a fight you can cancel it to get the cooldown faster

[2023-01-09 16:35:14] <%jayflat> my guess is that only worked because it was the moment you spawned in
[2023-01-09 16:35:21] <+TwitchyGamerMom> does symmetra's turrets hit sombra even when she's clocked? also same question about torb's turrets. thx chat
[2023-01-09 16:35:22] <saphirerider> well you might be able to emong, spear+dmg boost mercy+ ana nano + bap field
[2023-01-09 16:35:24] <FaIgarth> I've been one tapped by widow through spawn door
[2023-01-09 16:35:25] <CassiHikari> Everything goes through the spawn doors now, but they should have no collision on player

[2023-01-09 16:35:31] <+darklord1061> i doubt you could die in spawn
[2023-01-09 16:35:32] <saphirerider> so open queue
[2023-01-09 16:35:36] <%iliketoeatpineapples> need to test it out  KEKW
[2023-01-09 16:35:39] <iRecoil> you can def die in spawn
[2023-01-09 16:35:40] <%widowmakre> well no bc when you're in spawn, you have the same effect as wraith form/suzu
[2023-01-09 16:35:42] <dragonlord793> try it
[2023-01-09 16:35:42] <bargster> you can boop with lucio through spawn doors too

[2023-01-09 16:36:05] <saphirerider> just get nano boosted
[2023-01-09 16:36:07] <So1arr> no
[2023-01-09 16:36:08] <%ThisIsCrabTV> No
[2023-01-09 16:36:09] <jobrosef> nano boost prob
[2023-01-09 16:36:10] <N7Nerohol> with wall pin maybe?
[2023-01-09 16:36:16] <luminar0> i dont get why spawn does just apply invulnerability
[2023-01-09 16:36:18] <kimchaew6n> yeah
[2023-01-09 16:36:19] <OhFrankl> Nano would
[2023-01-09 16:36:22] <%Zhombiefood> if they were anti'd though you could be low HP in spawn
[2023-01-09 16:36:25] <jobrosef> mythbusters time
[2023-01-09 16:36:25] <fuji9021> overkill
[2023-01-09 16:36:25] <saphirerider> emong, nano boost+ bap field easily kills
[2023-01-09 16:36:26] <%iliketoeatpineapples> nano boosted and bap window will do the trick  KEKW
[2023-01-09 16:36:27] <Everion> Javelin works with Bap right?
[2023-01-09 16:36:36] <%widowmakre> i think the reason you got hit with the javelin is because you had literally spawned as soon as the javelin hit you so i guess the invulnerable effect hadnt been applied yet
[2023-01-09 16:36:36] <luminar0> i meant why doesnt spawn just make you invulnerable
[2023-01-09 16:36:38] <kimchaew6n> thats not ethical

[2023-01-09 16:37:05] <kap0995> Could you sigma rock a tracer through spawn door?
[2023-01-09 16:37:06] <%jayflat> I don't think the wall impact part would deal damage, so it would be less damage than that
[2023-01-09 16:37:07] <%Hotrodzman> Cap final point for 10 gifted!
[2023-01-09 16:37:08] <%Culein_> i need to try that

[2023-01-09 16:43:23] <+Goofballs_25> You can google Orisa's ult timing but yeah 160% charge is the min for full 200
[2023-01-09 16:43:29] <bean_pot_10> just give brooks the mercy and this game is over

[2023-01-09 16:44:45] <Violentnutslap> @zachscoots69420 yes shes to op but ult is useless
[2023-01-09 16:44:52] <+ericksomebody> Nah orisa ult slaps. Even if it gets suzud its still a way to group everybody for dps to kill em or a fat ana nade
[2023-01-09 16:44:55] <+cl0ud_dealer> Not enough support
[2023-01-09 16:44:58] <%Oneminuterice> ult gets cucked by suzu
[2023-01-09 16:44:59] <+darklord1061> it's ok, it works a bit like zarya's graviton orb but does damage as well

[2023-01-09 16:45:03] <+koiax> rip

[2023-01-09 16:45:54] <%zachscoots69420> I fell like her ult is a good ult to pair with a damage ult like Juck, tracer, reaper
[2023-01-09 16:45:56] <Violentnutslap> i agree but other ult dosnt need other ults to work, feel lik orisa ult need a type stun ult to work idk

[2023-01-09 18:07:27] <bluelabrador> @shadowtheone3242 I know. I'm buying the battle pass just to get this skin. I may as well have one mythic on my 5 year old account

[2023-01-09 18:07:42] <+OwenChief> @nuttz_slappingbutts this ^ orb takes forever to heal anyone.. the only reason the healing goes high in scoreboard is because of trans
[2023-01-09 18:07:50] <+Guts72> If they nerf hog & kiriko suzu, queen would see a lot more play
[2023-01-09 18:07:53] <%TheGreekSpeedster> Put discord orb on a 3 second cooldown per target and give him the ability to float if you hold space NODDERS
[2023-01-09 18:07:53] <+TalionFloyd> I feel like zen accomplishes his niche pretty well
[2023-01-09 18:08:06] <sunny_boy17> Its odd how zen has no other abilities than his orbs looking at his kit,
[2023-01-09 18:08:13] <%+Shadowtheone3242> @bluelabrador lol i feel u i only care about the skins for ppl i use in game
[2023-01-09 18:08:19] <Peekiimon> I really like JQ in brawls, but I dislike her defensive playstyle on payload maps so much

[2023-01-09 18:30:46] <Krylphi> Try mousepad with CORDURA surface. It has benefits of hard and soft mousepads for me
[2023-01-09 18:30:49] <%N30NxL1T3x> if you hit your desk with a glass pad you might bleed to death

[2023-01-09 18:48:50] <doctooowned> rl is the kind of game that you can havve 3k hours in and still be bad
[2023-01-09 18:48:51] <ChipJiggins> does OW2 even have a Mouse Accel option?
[2023-01-09 18:48:55] <+aaymon86> Rocket league is fun....And also the hardest game I've ever played in my life lol
[2023-01-09 18:48:59] <%+999Clipped> heavy mouse means higher sens most likely
[2023-01-09 18:49:00] <%stephstephy> mouse accel is in windows

[2023-01-09 18:49:21] <ogkushkilla02> Same as ow but top 500 don’t exist it’s SSL
[2023-01-09 18:49:22] <colly_rl> I'm champ 2 with 1k on controller
[2023-01-09 18:49:23] <+aaymon86> It with free to play after I bought it lol

[2023-01-09 18:49:27] <%justchris899> they have like play diamond champion
[2023-01-09 18:49:29] <Outtatime> It's not much different than OW.  Though being bronze in RL is very rare these days
[2023-01-09 18:49:34] <+maktrophies> do you have any of the new titles?
[2023-01-09 18:49:37] <sirwaltz2> bronze 1-4, Gold, plat, diamond, Champ, grand champ. SSL
[2023-01-09 18:49:39] <%+karetluvspopunk> september 2020 apparently
[2023-01-09 18:49:39] <kcenters7> It was originally free on PlayStation at the beginning
[2023-01-09 18:49:44] <Outtatime> You have to be really really bad to be bronze now
[2023-01-09 18:49:48] <%stephstephy> I could do it

[2023-01-09 18:50:00] <Outtatime> There are almost as many SSLs than Bronze

[2023-01-09 18:50:14] <+mattkk12> @Emongg why do you think they made bronze such a wide pool of players, wouldnt it be better to have current bronze be like silver
[2023-01-09 18:50:19] <%stephstephy> I have some Lucio ball games that I think would put me squarely in bronze
[2023-01-09 18:50:20] <%+karetluvspopunk> I'm too aggressive in RL so that's my downfall KEKW

[2023-01-09 19:01:15] <%+Supertek> ok so in RL when you jump you can flip just once. If your 4 wheels touch something, you can flip again. Flip resetting is touching the ball mid-air with the bottom of your car to reset your flip counter and flip multiple times in the air

[2023-01-09 19:07:38] <@%^StreamElements> wehavegotagamer, Emongg's ult is on numpad4 because he plays with arrow keys. He does not play left handed. The reason the other abilities say E and Shift is because they are double bound.

[2023-01-09 19:27:19] <%TheEmpireRoyale> ping issue?
[2023-01-09 19:27:25] <+GoPhilma> sojourn shooting you and you're still invulnerable
[2023-01-09 19:27:28] <bombig_xx> It should be because of the progamation from Sigma Ult, because his damage is like falldamage but there is no falldamage in the game.
[2023-01-09 19:27:29] <%widowmakre> wait what was it
[2023-01-09 19:27:29] <blazardchu> where apologems.. sorry apolocredits

[2023-01-09 19:27:42] <%WhyteLillies> could be a mercy bug
[2023-01-09 19:27:45] <ImpossibleGT> @tf2dove It does a small amount of damage when it lifts

[2023-01-09 19:28:09] <ObeseWizard> @bombig_xx I believe sigma's ult actually gives you damage from straight above because you can block straight up with doom/ram to negate dmg

[2023-01-09 19:38:50] <envynade_> @hotasstwink my dude, there's a reason mercy is meta in GM, a good mercy has insane movement, especially in valk, and it having counters as someone's ultimate makes perfect sense

[2023-01-09 19:39:31] <+hotasstwink> mercy is relevant because sojourn is meta.

[2023-01-09 19:59:52] <%+SynthhInHD> @Jwormy is it an ego thing? like once they've locked in initially they absolutely can't swap otherwise they'd look bad?
[2023-01-09 19:59:58] <$tf2dove> @oreosaan yes

[2023-01-09 20:00:22] <GRUMPYGOBLIN_OW> Is it better to go for the supports first and then the tank? Or do most people just try to take out the Tank first?
[2023-01-09 20:00:25] <Jwormy> @SynthhInHD I cant really speak for that high of a rank but down in the dumpster where I am its simply b/c "You cant tell me what to do" ego

[2023-01-09 20:00:59] <rubsterbuster> @grumpygoblin_ow if you take out the supports first the tank will be easier to take down
[2023-01-09 20:01:13] <%+SynthhInHD> @Jwormy yeah... I can only speak for myself, but if I'm tank and I'm not pulling my weight or on par with the enemy tank, I'm gonna swap to something that I think might work better... Feels odd to me that others don't think that way
[2023-01-09 20:01:33] <%TheEmpireRoyale> aim trainers [for OW specifically] are just really good for speed .. target acquisition vs total accuracy

[2023-01-09 21:20:14] <%Zhombiefood> @maku2x my recommendation is to practice a variety of heroes.  half of playing against the enemy hero is knowing what they're trying to do in certain scenarios
[2023-01-09 21:20:16] <lezmetv> she was fun in beta but I see why they nerfed her. Also if Kiriko was around I wonder how she would perform back then
[2023-01-09 21:20:17] <ilovepooping12> @redkakti Me too ;)
[2023-01-09 21:20:22] <pswdpineapple> if kiriko teleports with the knife in her, you should be able to pull her back through her teleport to you. LUL

[2023-01-09 21:28:19] <+ihassquidhat> @Emongg Just a fun idea i had for kiriko would be to make the heal bursts come out faster and allow players to do like 3 healing 2 kunai then use the rest of the 2 healing, and then reset to 5. (aka just allowing them to be able to swap between healing and dps at any time withought any downside of canceling the heal) and make it so suzu pauses anti duration instead of hard cleanse

[2023-01-09 21:32:28] <%+nothinggood27> @tm_901 the rework is the nerf, if I understand them right
[2023-01-09 21:32:32] <%Zhombiefood> I think they should triple hog's hook length, but halve the speed
[2023-01-09 21:32:42] <%Zhombiefood> so if he misses he's just stuck there watching it for 3 seconds
[2023-01-09 21:32:49] <%+tm_901> @nothinggood27 oh, i thought they said they were going to do a nerf and then a rework later

[2023-01-09 21:40:07] <talllittleshortie> Orisa shouldn’t be nerfed if hog isn’t in my opinion, mainly because her sustainability is one of the only ones that can compare with Roadhog’s, it needs to be both or neither or we’ll go right back to dead by daylight with the hog

[2023-01-09 21:41:12] <%widowmakre> @purpmajick LOL
[2023-01-09 21:41:21] <%TheGreekSpeedster> If they don't nerf her along with hog it's gonna be a big issue
[2023-01-09 21:41:30] <redkakti> @TheGreekSpeedster yeah
[2023-01-09 21:41:31] <+traplordmom> @TheGreekSpeedster Exactly, and you could try and ignore her and go for her team, but if she isn't braindead, she's gonna turn around and kill you.

[2023-01-09 21:44:20] <talllittleshortie> I’m curious as to what y’all think of this. Take away the shield pierce of the ult and give it to her javelin. Idk if it would be good or bad, I’m just curious lol

[2023-01-09 21:45:16] <talllittleshortie> The reason I ask is cause that’s what I had initially thought had happened when we got the buff and I was shocked lol
[2023-01-09 21:45:21] <redkakti> @talllittleshortie hmmmm there iss alreay not a lot of shields in game it would make them uselles

[2023-01-09 21:45:44] <Adsta0> @talllittleshortie her ult would be really really weak again, and her javelin would be even more op so I don't think that's a good idea

[2023-01-09 22:14:17] <%SkitzoCTRL> @juanpatuscolegas It also helps that the tank is usually more reliant upon getting heals because they're so big and DPS need to be a bit more independent.

[2023-01-09 22:14:56] <%blondejohn96> As a new Overwatch 2 player, it's important to remember that not liking a hero like Sojourn may indicate a need to improve skills rather than a flaw in the character. Practice and develop your skills before trash talking him.

[2023-01-09 22:28:20] <UtelveScaRo> I think Orisa javelin should be on a 2 second cd. I think that’s a good change
[2023-01-09 22:28:26] <UtelveScaRo> Not bad not bad
[2023-01-09 22:28:36] <not_tyler1234> Push is so bad
[2023-01-09 22:28:44] <%blondejohn96> 2 seconds IS a lot. i keep telling that to my wife
[2023-01-09 22:28:46] <nessrh> Push mod is just boring

[2023-01-09 22:28:58] <%+tm_901> push is basically a teamfight scoreboard, if you get a lead of 3 you instantly win
[2023-01-09 22:28:58] <redkakti> NOOO
[2023-01-09 22:29:02] <%widowmakre> i agree, push is ass
[2023-01-09 22:29:09] <EpitaphCrimson> I like push
[2023-01-09 22:29:13] <%widowmakre> and theres only 3 map options
[2023-01-09 22:29:23] <%widowmakre> 2 of which are ass
[2023-01-09 22:29:25] <%+tm_901> they should add some new modes tbh
[2023-01-09 22:29:30] <%+tm_901> would be good to have more variety
[2023-01-09 22:29:41] <MagicMooseMoo> Shambali sucks for push, which push map do hate?
[2023-01-09 22:29:47] <UtelveScaRo> Supposedly we’re getting a new mode this year, no idea what it’s gonna be
[2023-01-09 22:29:47] <not_tyler1234> I miss assault and the maps

[2023-01-09 22:30:23] <UtelveScaRo> Wonder if they’ll ever add unstoppable cc? Like, could the game ever get that power-crept?
[2023-01-09 22:30:25] <Janek1991> THey should fix 2CP by making the spawn tunnels much longer

[2023-01-09 22:30:48] <legitrambo> isn't this game stressful to play?
[2023-01-09 22:30:59] <$owSvelle> Opinion on a Mercy balance change idea: Change her dmg boost to work like Moira's heal, give it a charge so she cant continuously pocket a dps?

[2023-01-09 22:32:20] <UtelveScaRo> Push vs 2cp is weird cus push is a really fun casual mode but terrible for competitive, and 2cp was miserable for casual players but saw a lot of cool and interesting games at the professional level

[2023-01-09 23:17:13] <QuantumForceGG> @emeraldplums it should be k&m vs K&m, and controller vs controller. If someone wants to play on their switch, and use a k&m only let them queue vs k&m
[2023-01-09 23:17:16] <%DriverSim> Yeah, I did interrupt his ult, but most of it was just me walking to him
