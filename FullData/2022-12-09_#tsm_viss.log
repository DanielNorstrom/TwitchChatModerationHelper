[2022-12-09 13:56:01] <+DukeJukemTV> aim assist might be the dumbest thing about this game
[2022-12-09 13:56:29] <nyfuturestrader> Cronus is a little different‚Ä¶ it shakes your joystick for you in order to make the crosses stick
[2022-12-09 13:56:40] <nyfuturestrader> Through software

[2022-12-09 14:04:00] <%+MMaRsu> If he doesnt stream it on Twitch he can do it
[2022-12-09 14:04:04] <%the_nix_mix> @ParanoidGlitch93 i think Doc is allowed to play with twitch streamers now
[2022-12-09 14:04:10] <%+MMaRsu> @ParanoidGlitch93 I think then it would be allowed
[2022-12-09 14:04:24] <%+MMaRsu> @the_nix_mix Yeah but they cant stream him on Twitch... soo..
[2022-12-09 14:04:57] <%goldencoreo> it depends if viss has a contract that only allows him to stream on twitch
[2022-12-09 14:05:14] <ParanoidGlitch93> Ah yeah, makes sense
[2022-12-09 14:05:14] <%+MMaRsu> Absolutely

[2022-12-09 14:11:25] <ParanoidGlitch93> the Vector is busted, they need to add more recoil or something lmao
[2022-12-09 14:11:25] <%goldencoreo> fennec is def tough to beat from that range
[2022-12-09 14:11:56] <%+Stripperlover> you were in the open
[2022-12-09 14:11:59] <+Cipher_Encrypt> in that close range u cant beat vector
[2022-12-09 14:12:27] <ParanoidGlitch93> Get em out!
[2022-12-09 14:12:29] <%goldencoreo> i think dual pistols beat the vector from that range

[2022-12-09 14:21:01] <ghostagent0023> @nasbuckeyes i can agree completely, but if you take it away then the game will lose all the casual player base on controller, and they dont want that too happen
[2022-12-09 14:21:18] <%nasbuckeyes> @ghostagent0023 they can play on their consoles
[2022-12-09 14:21:18] <%+Endlessdecline> I bought a controller idk how people do it . And I‚Äôve played console most of my life

[2022-12-09 16:57:32] <%jd933> It's weird to me they didn't try with CDL being a thing, like I feel fans are more interested in BR pro leagues than TDM type stuff.. but I guess that's just my opinion maybe cod watchers aren't that interested in a warzone pro league
[2022-12-09 16:57:42] <bbygt711> Can we run

[2022-12-09 17:02:20] <+ferkel9> no update on stam, i checked google and all it says is to log off of the steam before the game, and i dont want to do it every time -.-
[2022-12-09 17:02:29] <%blove_chitown> @TSM_Viss i got a question that should make sense but doesnt. Why is it, Apex, COD, etc, the games are huge player based, they spend so much money on the game, whats in it, sometimes pointless skins, camos, etc. but they all have the biggest problems with servers, connectivity, lag, latency, ping. I think it would be wise to drop $$ on that side, wouldnt you?

[2022-12-09 17:59:53] <%peacebeard> @tehfintal probably hardest in solos i'd think
[2022-12-09 18:00:11] <%+killacouga> @tehfintal then complete the nuke contract. that contract is hard AF

[2022-12-09 18:08:09] <%blove_chitown> @hoplaw using this optic you have to use the barrel attachment that conceals flash

[2022-12-09 18:08:19] <@%ALr52> @max21max2121 sorry to hear that man. i hear that gaming makes you feel better.
