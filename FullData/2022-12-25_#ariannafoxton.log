[2022-12-25 19:53:43] <!%NiteAssassin_> idk if its supposed too but the f16 in game has a staged after burner
[2022-12-25 19:55:22] <@%+Cruuvo> ouf
[2022-12-25 19:55:23] <%AceWindhover> fun fact, the F-16, (and probably others) have a 4X redundant flight control signal, so if one gets damaged, theres 3 more that still operates the flight control surfaces

[2022-12-25 21:53:02] <%NicoRakshasa> Santa with a winchester
[2022-12-25 21:53:02] <%eriktheos> why would he have wood furniture? He flies high where it's wetter so it would be harder to maintain
[2022-12-25 21:53:06] <+svensonidis> so an AK makes sense to me
[2022-12-25 21:53:06] <+Nevimir> Santa uses a AA-12 with FRAG-12
[2022-12-25 21:53:11] <%ErskineArmory> Or an over under shotgun
[2022-12-25 21:53:22] <rindred> Santa is an AWP guy.

[2022-12-25 21:54:51] <%TranquilityDN> The sack isn't presents, it's all ammo belts
[2022-12-25 21:54:55] <%hanstinen> He uses a Vickers Maxim.
[2022-12-25 21:55:13] <%srLndCS> his sleigh will have flares
[2022-12-25 21:55:16] <%TranquilityDN> Maxim is a strong contender
[2022-12-25 21:55:21] <HobbyDictator> considering his occupation and method of  transport, I feel that some sort of mounted artillery on the sleigh and some sort of close quarter combat stuff with low penetration should fit
[2022-12-25 21:55:45] <+Lufishshmebb> given the fact that Santa is capable of visiting like, the entire world in a single night its not beyond suggestion that he has some sort of future weapons that he's packing
[2022-12-25 21:55:49] <+Lufishshmebb> that and a 1911
[2022-12-25 21:55:51] <%ErskineArmory> He'd carry a suomi smg.

[2022-12-25 21:56:27] <HobbyDictator> I would not be surprised if santa brought a big knife and nothing else when breaking and entering
[2022-12-25 21:56:30] <%$iantheflat> Or he is really oldschool and has a bandolier of flintlock pistols
[2022-12-25 21:56:33] <%srLndCS> if he can bring me PCs and so on why not
[2022-12-25 21:56:36] <%JakeoftheWest> Thats a good point, Santa is on top of the newest tech. So he probably has modern weaponry. Or just something rock solid
[2022-12-25 21:56:38] <%srLndCS> hes a tech geek for sure
[2022-12-25 21:56:40] <%eriktheos> would he be easier to aimL or harder?
[2022-12-25 21:56:50] <+Lufishshmebb> Santa's sleigh has 0 stealth characteristics, he wants you to know that he's coming. Its an intimidation factor

[2022-12-25 21:57:44] <CumissarCoconut> Considering how fast he moves to go around the world in one night, hes moving extremely fast, doubt radars pick him up

[2022-12-25 21:58:01] <+Lufishshmebb> sure I've not seen him but NORAD tracks him every year so y'know, 0 stealth characteristics it just goes at borderline light speed (probably) so good luck hitting him
[2022-12-25 21:58:03] <capskii> rudolphs red nose is a IR dazzler
[2022-12-25 21:58:04] <rindred> If Santa's sleigh actually traveled the amount of distance in the time allotted, his sleigh would create a shockwave that would flatten your house.
[2022-12-25 21:58:06] <+Nevimir> Santa sleigh is just a Douglas AC-47 Spooky
[2022-12-25 21:58:09] <%Ilies45> you can see Santa in the War Thunder hangar fixing the sleigh's hardpoints
