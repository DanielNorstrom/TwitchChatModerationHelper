[2022-12-19 13:24:27] <bajablastnachofries> that's the mentality of most professors here in the US, they don't take attendance as long as you pass the exams
[2022-12-19 13:24:27] <%moisesbed> I went to two unis In the uk they only check few lectures here in newcastle‚Ä¶. Up t9 the lecturer to check attendance
