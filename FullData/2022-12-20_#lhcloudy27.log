[2022-12-20 16:31:51] <%+Aceattack> why these orisa players don’t use an actual good skin
[2022-12-20 16:31:51] <%+xbands1ips> reinhardt could do like increased m1 damage scaling to the size of their enemy
[2022-12-20 16:31:55] <%+xbands1ips> would be cool
[2022-12-20 16:31:59] <mixeryow> Orisa is just a hardcounter

[2022-12-20 16:33:06] <@%vodka_n_tonic> They should just stop one of her abilities from blocking rein's damage
[2022-12-20 16:33:10] <%torbjorn__love> orisa > rein
[2022-12-20 16:33:10] <clasux> so many indirect rein nerfs...

[2022-12-20 16:47:20] <%+EmilionOW> @GIRLinMaleBody hahaha, if I say no, I would be hyprocrytical, but acually no
[2022-12-20 16:47:26] <%+Slapo0> @hojushi placements were bugged

[2022-12-20 16:47:29] <Sakkoliha> @EmilionOW if finnish women are hornier than swedes, I feel sorry for the swedish men and their once in a lifetime intercourse
[2022-12-20 16:47:38] <%GIRLinMaleBody> bronze is like deep diving
[2022-12-20 16:47:39] <%MintJamz> I didn't play comp in 30+ seasons and got placed silver 1 as support but climbed to top 500
[2022-12-20 16:47:45] <%+Slapo0> I got bronze 5 on support but I think I just belong there :(
[2022-12-20 16:48:01] <%+xbands1ips> wait if a new season starts do you queue with like bronze players?
[2022-12-20 16:48:13] <%GIRLinMaleBody> no

[2022-12-20 16:48:54] <mixeryow> My mmr must be really high if everyone is losing their rank and i climb an entire rank up with placements
[2022-12-20 16:48:56] <%+xbands1ips> swedish women are mid
[2022-12-20 16:49:03] <%+xbands1ips> I know that as an Australian
[2022-12-20 16:49:04] <%GIRLinMaleBody> placements in ow2 would even worse cuz they ask for u to win 7 games

[2022-12-20 16:49:26] <%darkphoenixempire> its sadge that you cannot see lost games. Only 10 previous games, but that is not it

[2022-12-20 16:50:57] <%R1PCandice> Push >>>>> 2cp
[2022-12-20 16:51:05] <mixeryow> I hate push because its super hard to win if the enemy team has 2 good pushes and you need to walk forever until you reach the robot
[2022-12-20 16:51:06] <%+kemboi> I enjoy not seeing the SR number take a hot steaming dump on me.
[2022-12-20 16:51:06] <Awezomenezz> i think esperanca is fun, colisseo mid and NQS garbo

[2022-12-20 16:51:42] <%GIRLinMaleBody> u got snowballed back
[2022-12-20 16:51:52] <%+Aceattack> push requires you to not stack 5 on robot and take advantage positions for next fight
[2022-12-20 16:51:54] <%+xbands1ips> 1v1 me on rein ngl
[2022-12-20 16:51:58] <%Juzanthapus> I find that most people that don’t like push, aren’t paying attention to the payload progress most of the time
[2022-12-20 16:52:11] <%+Slapo0> Yes but in comp people just get demoralised and just play like noob until lose
[2022-12-20 16:52:12] <%GIRLinMaleBody> its oricha guy again

[2022-12-20 16:53:48] <%+xbands1ips> the only time I don't like push is when the enemy team is full of divers on colloseo
[2022-12-20 16:53:54] <mixeryow> And i really really REALLY dislike the map Design of colloseo

[2022-12-20 16:54:50] <%darkphoenixempire> I think Esperansa is the best push map
[2022-12-20 16:54:58] <Difficult_Hit> @LhCloudy27 probably a very generic question buh i wanna get better at tanking is there tips you can give for a low ranked player xD
[2022-12-20 16:55:00] <%GIRLinMaleBody> aint no way
[2022-12-20 16:55:09] <Awezomenezz> the thing i don't like about push is that the maps are so linear, esperanca less so which is why it's my favorite by far

[2022-12-20 17:25:34] <AfflictionsAgents> Looks like is still 90
[2022-12-20 17:25:51] <%Magicturtle12> Aceattack i've stopped caring for the most part about 250, it's almost exclusively relevant to pinning a mei or reaper and those characters are rarely played
[2022-12-20 17:25:52] <%+xbands1ips> how much does m1 do?
[2022-12-20 17:26:06] <%+xbands1ips> @Magicturtle12 reaper rarely played??? LOL

[2022-12-20 17:26:20] <zekster131> rein better or worse than in ow1
[2022-12-20 17:26:26] <Artayis> the problem with that though is that it only does 63 against armored targets now
[2022-12-20 17:26:26] <%+babblingbrandon> im rein main was playing today and realised its not needed trust me
[2022-12-20 17:26:29] <%+Aceattack> much better than ow1
[2022-12-20 17:26:31] <%+xbands1ips> @zekster131 he has more health and less shield I think
[2022-12-20 17:26:34] <Artayis> Rein doesnt do shit against other tanks
[2022-12-20 17:26:37] <%Magicturtle12> xbands1ips yeah i'd bet money right now reaper is in the lower %s for pick rate
[2022-12-20 17:26:49] <%+xbands1ips> @Magicturtle12 he's in every second game I play

[2022-12-20 17:28:23] <%+babblingbrandon> rein would be able  to take 2 players down with 2 firestrikes if 100 during mid battle
[2022-12-20 17:28:24] <Bhaalatoni> sry caps
[2022-12-20 17:28:32] <%Magicturtle12> wouldn't a good hog always be able to avoid environmental pins?
[2022-12-20 17:28:32] <Artayis> whole hog shits on rein thats about it really

[2022-12-20 17:29:24] VIEWERS: 445
[2022-12-20 17:29:25] <%+xbands1ips> orisa is stupid
[2022-12-20 17:29:28] <%Dark__Hase> u mean a clear 1v1 without healers?
[2022-12-20 17:29:31] <+chesly_vakarian> she has to misuse fortify so you can charge the spin, cannot even shield the orisa ult anymore
[2022-12-20 17:29:35] <%+babblingbrandon> but orisia has the same genreal stragety so she just ruins rein with cooldowns
[2022-12-20 17:29:35] <%+TheTurtleHax> then she ult
[2022-12-20 17:29:37] <%+hojushi> Wouldn’t rein v jq be easier than zar
[2022-12-20 17:29:39] <basically_lololol> doesnt her helicopter push pin away
[2022-12-20 17:29:52] <%+ecksdeexd69> Orisa isn’t fun at all either I don’t get why people pick her
[2022-12-20 17:29:52] <%+xbands1ips> zarya can bubble people you pin
[2022-12-20 17:29:53] <%+xbands1ips> it is annoying
[2022-12-20 17:30:10] <Artayis> JQ does huge damage compared to low charge zar idk..
[2022-12-20 17:30:30] <%+xbands1ips> you say pin roadhog off the map but when you go for pin he will just hook YOU off the map lol
[2022-12-20 17:30:32] <TheSeckshualBrotatoChip> what about Rein vs Hog Kiriko?

[2022-12-20 17:47:10] <Artayis> Main is based on what you don't change based on the comp, and flex is more flexible and you can pick different heroes.

[2022-12-20 17:47:11] <%+TheTurtleHax> i want her heal travel time slightly less and her heal amount less aswell

[2022-12-20 17:47:21] <AfflictionsAgents> @vizzim_ main support peels for flex support. flex support heals the tank. flex supports deal more damage on average
[2022-12-20 17:47:29] VIEWERS: 457
[2022-12-20 17:47:32] <Artayis> Main is Lucio because you need speed in a rush comp right?

[2022-12-20 17:47:35] <%+xbands1ips> I thought lucio was skilled
[2022-12-20 17:47:37] <ziqjid> ask Henry what is he cooking
[2022-12-20 17:47:38] <touchme32> you can shatter through the payload?
[2022-12-20 17:47:40] <%MintJamz> @xbands1ips You don't need to be good at aiming with Lucio but it helps
[2022-12-20 17:47:40] <Artayis> but you can run flex moira, bap or ana.

[2022-12-20 18:18:05] <%+herpesfreesince3> Nobody with that poor of awareness and mousepositioning has that good of aiming
[2022-12-20 18:18:09] <Txao> if he has value he is gotta be cheating

[2022-12-20 18:20:24] <ranchosauce> his crosshair placement is just Pepega
[2022-12-20 18:20:30] <%+sh0kw1v3> i think he might be relying on his mechanical aim to account for his bad positioning, which makes him op whenever he positions well

[2022-12-20 19:23:47] <@%billmcgreezy> u jus is a French culinary term meaning "with juice". It refers to meat dishes prepared or served together with a light broth or gravy, made from the fluids secreted by the meat as it is cooked. In French cuisine, cooking au jus is a natural way to enhance the flavour of dishes, mainly chicken, veal, and lamb.

He comes equipped with a very powerful height adjusting lever that’s perfect for our favorite streamer. LHChair doesn’t interact much so it’s really helps when chat can make their own content

He comes equipped with a very powerful height adjusting lever that’s perfect for our favorite streamer. LHChair doesn’t interact much so it’s really helps when chat can make their own content

[2022-12-20 20:27:58] <stiches3000> Hi cloudy, quick question from someone new to overwatch - I noticed that there are 11 tanks in overwatch 2. That is a lot of tanks. So that means each tank should get around 10% of the playtime. If that's the case, then why do people pick roadhog every single game? Just wondering what the game play/strat reason is - thanks for answering my noob question!

[2022-12-20 22:03:31] <Naos_ow> basically you want to queue your first punch with melee, punch a second time, block before the recovery for the 3rd punch. repeat
