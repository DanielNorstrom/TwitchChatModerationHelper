[2023-01-09 17:14:43] <+Alenarne> Ive been subject to 3 non-competes, not a single one held water for 5 seconds.

[2023-01-09 17:14:48] <IIbudll> would that mean rates up or down

[2023-01-09 17:15:19] <%+funky_dingle_berry> @TheStockGuy so if the employment market is looking this good and the stock market is handling it well, will that mean interest rates will be stagnant at a higher rate longer than expected?

[2023-01-09 17:15:34] <saintofgreed> In EU it was already ruled that if employer wants to have a non-compete clause in the employment contact the employee has to be compensated for that ie for example if you have 6month non-compete after employment you have to be paid 50% of the salary on that non-compete period etc
[2023-01-09 17:15:40] <$itsQuixRL> google can already do that since non-competes are illegal in california tho right?

[2023-01-09 17:30:36] <myst3001> just don't hold it for 30 days and it's gone. but if you buy in January then you can't write it off past year

[2023-01-09 17:31:36] <Zefalon> you are right
[2023-01-09 17:31:36] <%+gonzotronn> If you bought shares at $10 and more at $5 making your average $7.50, then sold at $9, you are still selling at a loss and triggering a wash sale because it's below the initial $10.

[2023-01-09 18:30:47] <+balloonz1> @Ivsenbaaby Universal Basic Income, basically you give everyone enough money for bare minimum existence so working is a choice. This is especially helpful when automation reduces the amount of labor needed to keep society running

[2023-01-09 18:56:22] <$urnewatdis> @BigJonster sorry you are having a bad experience trust me we have a lot of issues with community providers  the process for community care is not complicated the problem is the volume of vets and requests im sure your VA needs more staff If they can not see you in-house within 28 days for speciality you qualify for community care according to mission act
