[2023-01-05 06:17:34] <@^Streamlabs> Tengu are a type of legendary creature found in Japanese folklore. They are a type of mischievous supernatural being. They are traditionally depicted with both human and avian (bird like) characteristics. Birdie is 50% human, 50% Tengu, and a 100% gremlin. Also those are horns on her head, not panda ears.

[2023-01-05 06:50:21] <%Hellspawn_Godfather> Honestly there are reasons that I, too, find ASMR weird. But it's... the good weird.
[2023-01-05 06:50:32] <%mdkubit> "Mommy, there's this bird lady that's making these funny sounds!"   "Dear, that's called -talking..."   :D
[2023-01-05 06:50:51] <%Hellspawn_Godfather> Like, the weird that makes a kid obsessed with geodes for eight months and leaves him with the mental scar of wondering if every bumpy rock he sees after that has crystals in it

[2023-01-05 07:31:33] <@%^Streamlabs> Birdie has a neurological disorder called "visual snow", she constantly sees the world in static. It makes things harder for her to see, especially in the dark. Visual snow causes letters to blur together making it hard for Birdie to read out loud. If you want to learn more about Visual Snow this is a great article! https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/visual-snow-syndrome/
