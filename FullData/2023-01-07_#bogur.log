[2023-01-07 12:37:01] <+lilyie_ow> Reddit is if you gave bronze players the ego of a hardstuck masters player like me
[2023-01-07 12:37:02] <drystc22> Overwatch community: "THERE IS NOT ENOUGH CONTENT" also Overwatch Community: "NEW CONTENT SUCKS BLIZZARD BAD"
[2023-01-07 12:37:05] <@%+PigeonWho> its a nice deathmatch mode
[2023-01-07 12:37:09] <@%+PigeonWho> fun

[2023-01-07 12:37:13] <@%+PigeonWho> entertaining
[2023-01-07 12:37:21] <@%+PigeonWho> adds a twist to it
[2023-01-07 12:37:22] <%Digichanted> at least the cyclops shooting boulders with a machine shotgun is accurate
[2023-01-07 12:37:26] <+blygbank> it’s pretty cool

[2023-01-07 12:37:49] <@%+PigeonWho> they think theyre better
[2023-01-07 12:37:51] <@%+PigeonWho> but they arent
[2023-01-07 12:37:54] <+lilyie_ow> the ults just feel bullshitty but it's not meant to be competitive so I understand it
[2023-01-07 12:37:54] <+blygbank> i think we should delete reddit in general
[2023-01-07 12:37:56] <drystc22> i dislike that this mode removes my golden gun from the heroes
[2023-01-07 12:38:02] <@%+PigeonWho> nah reddit is fine

[2023-01-07 12:41:24] <+lilyie_ow> just because I can hit headshots on barely moving targets doesn't make me have good aim, the difference is that gms can hit shots on people that actually move

[2023-01-07 12:51:36] <+lilyie_ow> I liked overwatch 1 orisa more but I genuinely think that she wouldn't fit in overwatch 2
[2023-01-07 12:51:43] <%OsorkonXV> how do i subscribe to bogur mental asylum
[2023-01-07 12:51:44] <VikingJackAU> I like this mode, blizzard actually put a tiny bit of effort into it, even if it's to sell skins :)
[2023-01-07 12:51:48] <+KillSwitch_777> it is fun, I like it
[2023-01-07 12:51:49] <!%AbsenceOW> game mode is bad because no winton god
[2023-01-07 12:51:51] <+endlesskda> atleast the put a gamemode and not just skins
[2023-01-07 12:52:03] <priestliness> this is the first time i see someone say they liked orisa ow1 more
[2023-01-07 12:52:13] <aramche> well it's not the best for sure
[2023-01-07 12:52:16] <coumfist> i like the effort and the cocncept , but it makes me rage so much
[2023-01-07 12:52:26] <Stoewee> overwatch should put a iq test in before ppl can play

[2023-01-07 12:53:23] <Yievies> I think it's fun but putting 4 tanks against 2 dps and 1 support is kinda stupid xd
[2023-01-07 12:53:28] <%+LSqre> @stoewee disagree, then Winton mains would go extinct

[2023-01-07 12:53:33] <Mining_Master> I really don't like Blizzard and think they did many bad things but this is not one of them. I really don't get the outrage. The lack of rewards is an event issue not a gamemode issue😭 I'm playing it for fun lmao
[2023-01-07 12:53:39] <Deian69> how is games going, just came by stream?
[2023-01-07 12:53:41] <VikingJackAU> 1 Support? Lucio is a god in this mode
[2023-01-07 12:53:49] <Strattekun> Lucio is pretty sick yeah
[2023-01-07 12:53:49] <coumfist> yh some are fun some are not
[2023-01-07 12:54:06] <Strattekun> I really dont get the hate on this mode, it's fine

[2023-01-07 12:54:34] <Strattekun> Yeah a lot of gaming news outlets are proclaiming that the community thinks this is the "worst mode ever"
[2023-01-07 12:54:41] <coumfist> everyone is always complaining about this game
[2023-01-07 12:54:47] <Tyceeeee> you are just an overwatch streamer
[2023-01-07 12:54:50] <Yievies> Reddit is definetly loosing their collective mind
[2023-01-07 12:54:54] <+lilyie_ow> overwatch exists, therefore it is bad
[2023-01-07 12:54:56] <+KillSwitch_777> They are just bitchin, because they think cancel culture is cool

[2023-01-07 12:56:34] <VikingJackAU> Somebody who has never played deathmatch before hops into a game, complains about people kill stealing and third partying, rage quits and writes a reddit post.
[2023-01-07 12:56:39] <kestas158> its not lore accurate guys :nerd:

[2023-01-07 12:59:34] <%theburnix> the problem with content creators is that they feel like they need to focus on just one game
[2023-01-07 13:00:09] <!%+EvieliciousV> branching out to diff games can legit kill your career
[2023-01-07 13:00:09] <Mining_Master> What I don't get is people who aren't content creators who don't change game
[2023-01-07 13:00:12] <katmosk> u had 20-60 viewers

[2023-01-07 15:37:12] <+TrippyTriangle> so many counters
[2023-01-07 15:37:12] <%Thevrex> rampage is one of the ults of all time
[2023-01-07 15:37:16] <%SaturnWasBetter> But that would mean Blizzard wanted skill in their games
[2023-01-07 15:37:35] <%TriangleSqrt> @SaturnWasBetter not sure i'd want tracer in the meta without any stuns
[2023-01-07 15:37:56] <+TrippyTriangle> not to mention you can get stunned out of it
[2023-01-07 15:38:02] <Jonseredi> Imagine rampage just gave you like 500% movement speed for 2-3 seconds while you spin2win
