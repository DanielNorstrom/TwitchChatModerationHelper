[2023-01-04 19:35:02] <%WooordWooord> Theres like 18 games I want this year... they all single player though lol
[2023-01-04 19:35:29] <%+ameruski> single player games so boring to me
[2023-01-04 19:35:38] <%+ameruski> i like playing with friends
[2023-01-04 19:35:40] <%+kuze> yea
[2023-01-04 19:35:52] <%WooordWooord> @ameruski what are those
[2023-01-04 19:36:09] <%+ameruski> friends? lol
[2023-01-04 19:36:26] <%Nackie_> @toy_soldier_x I preordered it and it got delayed again so I got refunded vissKO vissCRY I comes out in April now I think
[2023-01-04 19:36:57] <%dawnofthedave387> @tsm_viss there were so many good clips yesterday that were hilarious. The way you get those out there and people retweet/like show their friends I feel like it spreads like a wild fire
[2023-01-04 19:37:00] <%WooordWooord> I just don't have time to sync up with folks anymore. Pre marriage and kid I put like 500 hours in squad pubg... and 2500 hours into FFXIV. But just don't have that ability to schedule game time much these days so single player is just easier
[2023-01-04 19:37:01] <%+dud3itsj3ff> @ameruski I get it, single player games used to be my favorite, but I can‚Äôt just sit by myself and play a game anymore.. I get like 20 minutes in and end up asking a friend if they want to play something lol

[2023-01-04 20:01:46] <+manxycakes> It‚Äôs tough to become a professional streamer. U have to have content, a good personality that people can relate to, u have talk to chat, and have a place where people enjoy coming to. I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs more to it than that, but as a viewer on multiple streamers, that seams to be the temples for becoming a good streamer.

[2023-01-04 20:35:32] <%JtotheDizzle> Makes it so using them past short/mid range isn‚Äôt very doable.
[2023-01-04 20:35:41] <@%ALr52> @Ninj4doggy i don't mind doing them, but i typically will kind of zone out and not pay attention between games or w/e
[2023-01-04 20:35:51] <%JtotheDizzle> And they aren‚Äôt as mobile as SMGs so there‚Äôs no real place for them as is.
[2023-01-04 20:36:10] <@%ALr52> i'm usually here and there during the work day so i'd miss if goals were achieved.
[2023-01-04 20:36:10] <%JtotheDizzle> Need to either make damage drop better on ARs or make LMGs even less mobile.

[2023-01-04 20:37:01] <jigensei> @JtotheDizzle so the real issues for ARs are drop-off DMG and mobility, Noted
[2023-01-04 20:37:06] <%+Toy_Soldier_x> I say give them more damage at range so they can compete as opposed to nerffing LMGs personally

[2023-01-04 20:40:28] <%JtotheDizzle> @toy_soldier_x I think it‚Äôs somewhere in the middle for sure. Fix AR damage drop to make them more balanced and useful and some of the LMGs definitely need recoil and mobility tweaks for balance.

[2023-01-04 20:55:33] <%Snow_Trouble> @darkestspartann I don‚Äôt play enough to really know anything other than the RPK seems to be the best overall right now mostly due to the drum mag is faster to reload than a belt.
[2023-01-04 20:55:45] <%+ameruski> fast and the furious
[2023-01-04 20:55:59] <%Darkestspartann> @Snow_Trouble nice ok. Really enjoying this game for a break from apex
[2023-01-04 20:55:59] <%dawnofthedave387> @Darkestspartann no worries, either the RPK or RAAL is all you want
[2023-01-04 20:56:08] <yaw_hydr4> this is entertaining af. W

[2023-01-04 20:57:50] <%+ameruski> riot shield hardly spawn on ground
[2023-01-04 20:58:03] <%Snow_Trouble> @darkestspartann Yeah I reached my apex goals really early this season so I‚Äôve been playing DMZ. COD needs some balancing to really be enjoyable for me and the pay/grind to win attachment mechanic is a huge let down. But I do like the gun mechanics and the change of scenery has been nice.
[2023-01-04 20:58:31] <%Darkestspartann> @Snow_Trouble havent tried DMZ yet
[2023-01-04 20:58:34] <%+Toy_Soldier_x> @snow_trouble what was ur apex goal?
[2023-01-04 20:58:39] <+Edwardxaa> @Snow_Trouble well said
[2023-01-04 20:58:44] <+oneeyedshot> Mic is static to confuse to annoy attackers...1000 IQ move.....LOL
[2023-01-04 20:58:51] <%+Toy_Soldier_x> I like DMZ! Always liked PvEvP modes
[2023-01-04 20:59:30] <%Snow_Trouble> @darkestspartann best mode so far for me, it‚Äôs extraction based similar to Tarkov with green mobile missions and a whole slew of progress based missions from the menu screen. It definitely needs expanded upon, very limited stash.

[2023-01-04 21:27:39] <%+Toy_Soldier_x> Ohhhhhh ok @jtothedizzle is there anyway to tell wether a building with orange flags is a Stronghold or a Blacksite?
[2023-01-04 21:27:56] <%+im_Jaybird> I think warzone with only throwing knifes would be sick @TSM_Viss
[2023-01-04 21:28:02] <%JtotheDizzle> Strongholds have their own icon on the map, looks like a house with a star in it sort of.
[2023-01-04 21:28:29] <%JtotheDizzle> Once you clear a stronghold the black site key you pick up typically has coords

[2023-01-04 21:28:52] <%JtotheDizzle> Also the orange flags have a different symbol on them I want to say
[2023-01-04 21:29:00] <%user41c> haha the ragdoll

[2023-01-04 21:30:00] <%JtotheDizzle> That RPK is dirty and Viss' aim medium/long with just the mini reflex site is filthy lol
[2023-01-04 21:30:40] <%user41c> @JtotheDizzle feels like this game favors low magni optics.

[2023-01-04 21:31:18] <%JtotheDizzle> @user41c if you can get the hang of target identification and aiming mid/long like that it's for sure better to run smaller faster optics

[2023-01-04 21:31:53] <%JtotheDizzle> @user41c time to get on sight and aim down sight with magnification optics is much much longer and your aim speed is much slower, harder to track while moving/shooting
[2023-01-04 21:31:57] <%user41c> @Toy_Soldier_x on LMG?
[2023-01-04 21:32:13] <%+Toy_Soldier_x> @user41c yep!
[2023-01-04 21:32:35] <%+im_Jaybird> yayayaya
[2023-01-04 21:32:37] <%JtotheDizzle> @Toy_Soldier_x 3.4 Schlager is what I run on my LMGs as well. It's the fastest with still a nice little bit of zoom

[2023-01-04 21:35:00] <%+Toy_Soldier_x> @user41c eyyy, same here. Had figured if u were on controller i could easily see the 3.4 jumpin a lot. I also have a lotta recoil control on my RPKs other attachments

[2023-01-04 21:36:39] <%user41c> @Toy_Soldier_x I do run fingertip grip and very high sens in general though. Never got used to palming a mouse, pretty much all my movement is wrist not elbow.
[2023-01-04 21:36:49] <%JtotheDizzle> Yeah for WZ I run silencer barrel grip for recoil control and stock for mobility, and schlager
[2023-01-04 21:36:56] <%JtotheDizzle> And it's tuned for recoil and ADS
[2023-01-04 21:37:25] <%JtotheDizzle> I plat controller on series X
