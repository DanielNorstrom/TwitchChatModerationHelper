[2023-01-04 15:40:28] <Yozika> it was just that particular raid, its fine
[2023-01-04 15:40:29] <%nopeboats> I think it is just some servers

[2023-01-04 15:40:37] <ks_unholy> they reduced the raid time to 20mins
[2023-01-04 15:40:39] <+Nitr0CircuS> think they do it scheduled
[2023-01-04 15:40:42] <%GorillaMonsoon25> Probably rolling resets

[2023-01-04 15:43:43] <NaroHuh_> They should really overhaul most of the quests entirely, make them interesting and more linear, instead of so many that have super weird objectives or are very risky for very minimal reward.
[2023-01-04 15:43:47] <+dstnyyyy> i hoped they would give more slots again because of the new stims ):

[2023-01-04 15:46:41] <NaroHuh_> I do not agree that quests are what makes or breaks tarkov. Tarkov gameplay is not its quests. Quests are tacked on, and they can be changed to be much better progression. I never said they had to be easy, they have to scale from easy to very hard at the end in a more fluid way
[2023-01-04 15:46:46] <%+ReinhardtVonLohengramm> I mean after you've done these quests for the nth time

[2023-01-04 15:47:22] <%Alldoped> I think they should remove tasks and then just add more dalies and more weeklies

[2023-01-04 15:47:44] <%gc_monster7> @narohuh_ that‚Äôs kind of true. But again, it‚Äôs Beta base Tarkov. Can‚Äôt expect much. Also BSG didn‚Äôt want too many people playing the game
[2023-01-04 15:47:48] <+DannyMans> its been 5yrs man 5 years lol please make crew dedicated to optimizing it already
[2023-01-04 15:47:53] <JooNYBoy2> whats going on with the audio! cant hear

[2023-01-04 15:47:55] <+vaidexx> @Alldoped agree
[2023-01-04 15:47:57] <NaroHuh_> I would say the gameplay of Tarkov is the hardcore part. Nothing wrong with reworking some systems, they do it all the time.
[2023-01-04 15:47:58] <+PapaTomss> what reason are there for some quests, I'm a noob so I have zero clue.
[2023-01-04 15:47:59] <%leather_argument> The quests make the game hardcore because they create scarcity and also force players into engagements with one another for similar items

[2023-01-04 15:48:27] <%gc_monster7> Most of the reason why quests are so hard because BSG wants people to feel the hardcore and less playing it, so that hey have easier time managed the game

[2023-01-04 15:48:36] <%+rFlocxs> Tarkov is an expressly well optimized game, both gameplay functionality and audio quality, especially considering its a small indie company that is developing the game with little background knowledge is development work ginger4Smiles
[2023-01-04 15:48:48] <+VisibleSpark> @PapaTomss They give you things to do. They give a lot of experience, and unlock items at vendors.

[2023-01-04 15:49:24] <+Pootie_Looter> or leave because of the garbage audio and a new map that barely runs

[2023-01-04 15:49:29] <%+MajorPainCA> Beginning off wipe, quests have far more people going for the same quests where later on the people numbers on same quests are lower.

[2023-01-04 16:00:56] <%ArsonLt> a cheater told me that if you stream and slightly cheat you can easily gain a following because youre "good" and roll with that
[2023-01-04 16:00:56] <domstar007> nice nice thanks
[2023-01-04 16:00:57] <ShroudedGaming> honestly I don't pay enough attention. All I know about her drama is what I have seen on tiktok. I hate COD so I don't watch it. But I do find it funny how many MALE content creators are so focused on Nadia rather than just focusing on there own brand lol
[2023-01-04 16:00:59] <%+MajorPainCA> You play at home and get used to high ping.  In lan you struggle because your gameplay was ping influenced.

[2023-01-04 16:01:21] <%$Brazicano> Nadia is a cheater! so much so that she was kicked out of the Activision event. for playing very poorly in the event
[2023-01-04 16:01:37] <foshoitzdanny> Sugar I think
[2023-01-04 16:01:37] <%+ReinhardtVonLohengramm> I think there's a lot of amphetamine use during tourneys
[2023-01-04 16:01:41] <%+JewsNBooze> Do you need NVGs for Streets at night? Or is that totally unnecessary

[2023-01-04 16:01:49] <+PapaTomss> @MajorPainCA big facts, back when I had DSL I would play at a buddies place and all of my shots were so fucked because he didnt have the ping issues that I did.
[2023-01-04 16:01:49] <ShroudedGaming> @jimmiedrum It a way for me to deflect from my own
[2023-01-04 16:01:53] <%GorillaMonsoon25> If I played 20yr old version of myself I would accuse me of cheating. There can be a huge gulf in skill levels.

[2023-01-04 16:05:39] <+DannyMans> the map is so beautifully designed...and has very intelligently designed as far as detail.  if it were any other game they wouldn't have access to as many buildings and rooms and more static art and objects
[2023-01-04 16:05:44] <Knauticul> I guess it‚Äôs my cpu idk
[2023-01-04 16:05:45] <foshoitzdanny> @meat_finder It‚Äôs on the top left

[2023-01-04 16:06:35] <prodigyak> @Knauticul pull up task manager while you play on a second screen.  See what's getting eaten up by you system.  CPU, Memory, GPU, etc.

[2023-01-04 16:07:44] <%chumppi> Only use DLSS if you really need to. It makes the graphics grainy and it's hard to see far away.

[2023-01-04 16:08:07] <+PapaTomss> @chumppi it killed the game for me, worse performance and looked like shit.
[2023-01-04 16:08:08] <%huckwild> @Knauticul honestly frames this wipe are better than ive ever seen them on all maps for me anyways but the rubberbanding on streets is crazy
[2023-01-04 16:08:10] <%+Jay_Vie> @Gingy that door uses a different key. it's a 1 use key called backup hideout key, the stair landing is different
[2023-01-04 16:08:10] <%chumppi> 19
[2023-01-04 16:08:13] <Revan104th> The door your at is Hideout door???
[2023-01-04 16:08:14] <prodigyak> @Knauticul look it up via the brand of motherboard you have.  You want to make sure you have that set as most don't by default.
[2023-01-04 16:08:31] <Revan104th> You don't have the key
[2023-01-04 16:08:32] <myliuamerica> no
[2023-01-04 16:08:35] <%ivienotme> @rflocxs I have been running Interchange and Woods and have literally not found a single Salewa. Not even found and died with.  I swear I am cursed for them.

[2023-01-04 16:08:47] <%+MajorPainCA> @Gingy that's the wrong key.  That's for 15 Chakennya St
[2023-01-04 16:08:49] <%goldenknight22> the stair key is in the loot house
[2023-01-04 16:08:56] <dHorrorist_> stairs goes to house near crane

[2023-01-04 16:09:41] <%chumppi> @huckwild the game runs at 144fps for me without dlss, no need to run it. You should only run it if you can't keep your FPS up.
[2023-01-04 16:09:50] <%+MajorPainCA> When you examine it the address was shoen

[2023-01-04 20:00:29] <%Gerberbaby4> tbh if you have EOD is Kappa even that much of an upgrade anyway
[2023-01-04 20:00:30] <olomacbolo1> thats dumb shit, but its our society we live in you get trained to be better than someone else and profilate with it sadge

[2023-01-04 20:57:13] <phaledaxx> For chat: Ice prevents swelling, by reducing blood flow used on soft tissue and muscles and heat relaxes the muscles and increases blood flow. For tendons and nerves and joints. Relaxing the surrounding muscles it brought relief. for soft tissue ice brings relief and thats the differences.

[2023-01-04 20:58:19] <+BrodyLocks> its your stream ging
[2023-01-04 20:58:20] <Cormical> its your career

[2023-01-04 20:58:22] <divinitylok> dont worry
[2023-01-04 20:58:26] <%+joadsta> 6 hours is still a lot.
[2023-01-04 20:58:32] <+BrodyLocks> you get the power ;)
[2023-01-04 20:58:32] <+FatherOwens> caarpal tunnel
[2023-01-04 20:58:32] <%loveu24fr> think about tomorrow gingy...
[2023-01-04 20:58:33] <CanEhdianLimit> hairline fracture?
[2023-01-04 20:58:37] <divinitylok> gotta take care of yourself
[2023-01-04 20:58:40] <%+RoyseDa6oh> Take a break and get some advil, its probably just overuse because of the wipe
[2023-01-04 20:58:40] <%+joadsta> hand and wrist are vital.  like... carpal tunnel is no joke
[2023-01-04 20:58:41] <+VisibleSpark> they fixed the airdrop sound?
[2023-01-04 20:58:44] <%tmacinc> When the pain didn't go down quickly it looked like it was going to hurt for a bit. You must've pinched a tendon or something
[2023-01-04 20:58:46] <barybravo> go to the doctor. don't want to risk that kind of injury getting worse
[2023-01-04 20:58:47] <+kiyoti_99> ice it and some ibuprofen to help any swelling
[2023-01-04 20:58:49] <Cormical> you're still using the muscles in the hand too, its gonna make it worse
[2023-01-04 20:58:49] <Papsh718> only 6 hours ? lol
[2023-01-04 20:59:02] <phaledaxx> if she hit her tendon that pain can last for hours. Someone mentioned this earlier
[2023-01-04 20:59:02] <%+joadsta> hell, i'm trying to encourage people to get a vertical mouse for every day use.
[2023-01-04 20:59:03] <olomacbolo1> its normal for the pain to last if you hit a nerve badly
[2023-01-04 20:59:05] <%+Halodoh> why is it always raining ugh
[2023-01-04 20:59:15] <crankyfisher> You can get a hand brace to support it if it is carpal tunnel.
[2023-01-04 20:59:16] <%+joadsta> vertical mice are GOATed
[2023-01-04 20:59:29] <+FatherOwens> meh wipe is over
[2023-01-04 20:59:35] <+philipfranck> just found my second sledge hammer, anyone know how much it sells for?
[2023-01-04 20:59:44] <CanEhdianLimit> If you hit it hard enough and its still in alot of pain, likely a stress fracture.
