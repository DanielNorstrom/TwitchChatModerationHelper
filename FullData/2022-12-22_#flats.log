[2022-12-22 02:35:01] <FireBadLuck> @MADcees Boats can't be used underwater, unless if there's artificial rivers underwater. Which now I'm typing it, would be epic

[2022-12-22 02:35:55] <widemelon> Clueless

[2022-12-22 03:22:40] <Rachel3107> It’s not technical is it
[2022-12-22 03:22:40] <%dietnoods> Susge she's literally just manipulating you after she fucked up 5 times in a row
[2022-12-22 03:22:43] <WizardLemon_> Skill issue
[2022-12-22 03:22:43] <%+Beersens> you could have payed her in cash ^^
[2022-12-22 03:22:44] <!RoadRunner_ow> I just got DMCA'd on twitter Chadge
[2022-12-22 03:22:45] <akaLazer_> @Flats You're not the bad guy, ppl like that try to flip it on everyone else. Not your fault she failed to deliver. You didn't get your food, she dont get her money. ez as that
[2022-12-22 03:22:47] <SxGh05t> you have to do the job first to get paid
[2022-12-22 03:22:49] <%$TinyHippo__> The delivery driver trying to one up that uber driver you had that went reverse on the highway
[2022-12-22 03:22:49] <%+whynottone> She kept herself from getting paid
[2022-12-22 03:22:52] <kinglamar313> Nobody told her to leave
[2022-12-22 03:22:53] <%+whynottone> Not your fault
[2022-12-22 03:22:53] <%m1lkshakey> prolly not the 1st time with that driver either
[2022-12-22 03:22:54] <+PowerKirby> seems like an organisational problem
[2022-12-22 03:22:55] <+kino7000> Nah she left you to do another order why was she clueless
[2022-12-22 03:22:58] <%+dankdogedude> flats no food story on yt soon?

[2022-12-22 03:23:00] <+OoiiiJosuke> Nah she coulda called you once she got there n couldn’t find it it’s 100% on her
[2022-12-22 03:23:01] <+RacketyGnome300> I bet she was the one who cancelled the order and lying about it
[2022-12-22 03:23:06] <%RoadRunner27> @RoadRunner_ow What for? music?

[2022-12-22 03:23:14] <EggheadMartin> Hey chat what am i watching?
[2022-12-22 03:23:14] <el_taco_eater> I use to deliver, youre barely supposed to call the ordering person...
[2022-12-22 03:23:19] <Fbomb101ers> I heard you guys had a hard time during the tournament. feels bad man.  hope you had fun
[2022-12-22 03:23:20] <%MADcees> shesssh
[2022-12-22 03:23:21] <%dietnoods> Well usually when a driver can't find your place they like... CALL YOU?
[2022-12-22 03:23:24] <%bigmilklord_231> like $25?
[2022-12-22 03:23:24] <+ckojie> @Flats i write "some satnavs go to wrong house, make sure you go this way...." on every delivery i get and not one has ever read it. ever
[2022-12-22 03:23:25] <%985geek> They have an obligation to deliver you food in a timely manner
[2022-12-22 03:23:26] <JekoKrain> drivers know when they look at the order
[2022-12-22 03:23:26] <%Tunt_Life> Tips usually come in like an hour after
[2022-12-22 03:23:31] <akaLazer_> @m1lkshakey probably not, with how fast support refunded and with zero questions lol
[2022-12-22 03:23:32] <+Eesane> yeah if they don't get paid they don't get the tip.
[2022-12-22 03:23:33] <+iAmFigured> Oh ik that driver is so blown about losing that tip
[2022-12-22 03:23:34] <Rachel3107> They know the tip before picking the job if it’s DoorDash
[2022-12-22 03:23:37] <%SwordBot1> ?? whats this?
[2022-12-22 03:23:40] <grande_padre> fumbled the bag
[2022-12-22 03:23:41] <FireBadLuck> So she could've gotten a stacked tip, but she didn't try harder to find you
[2022-12-22 03:23:46] <+vanille916> big tip gachiBASS
[2022-12-22 03:23:47] <!RoadRunner_ow> it was a meme I made but yea maybe the background music, it was lil nas @RoadRunner27
[2022-12-22 03:23:50] <el_taco_eater> unless the adress is wrong or something is weird youre not supposed to call and argue in the least
[2022-12-22 03:23:52] <FireBadLuck> Literally, fumbled the bag
[2022-12-22 03:23:53] <%MADcees> ill deliver what u want
[2022-12-22 03:23:57] <%bigmilklord_231> 25%
[2022-12-22 03:23:57] <+AussieLogician> @Flats A lot of drivers work for different delivery companies, so she left to make the other delivery from the different company..
[2022-12-22 03:23:57] <JekoKrain> I deliver food and we know how much we are tipped from the go
[2022-12-22 03:23:57] <+RacketyGnome300> My tip gets applied before I even order the food
[2022-12-22 03:23:58] <%quickburn619> Uber eats you get the tip notif an hour after
[2022-12-22 03:24:00] <%+sugoiiz> she will prob get fired but thats her fault for leaving
[2022-12-22 03:24:02] <%Tunt_Life> I drove UberEats for a while. It’s like an hour after you deliver.
[2022-12-22 03:24:04] <%bigmilklord_231> reveal the number?
[2022-12-22 03:24:07] <+iAmFigured> If she really wanted the money, she'd delivered and called ASAP
[2022-12-22 03:24:13] <DANTE_CODA> flats is this the first time happen?
[2022-12-22 03:24:14] <%Flashliger> What about PIZZA
[2022-12-22 03:24:15] <Tinkerjinxx> wait, did she eat it?
[2022-12-22 03:24:18] <Halownest> the map is looking good
[2022-12-22 03:24:20] <WizardLemon_> At that point i'd just drive to get the damn food
[2022-12-22 03:24:21] <%Flashliger> you have to have some pizza places open
[2022-12-22 03:24:23] <sanya567xxx> Well, if they do not leave, all the other orders are delayed so maybe its rational but you kind of shouldnt mark it as delivered. That's just dumb
[2022-12-22 03:24:24] <!RoadRunner_ow> its like 3 months old tho
[2022-12-22 03:24:27] <%985geek> Shes gonna try and deliver it again and show up at your house asking for money lmao
[2022-12-22 03:24:28] <kinglamar313> Free food at what cost lol nobody to her to leave bet u she learnt something
[2022-12-22 03:24:30] <FireBadLuck> I don't watch flats often, so I'm glad to witness this
[2022-12-22 03:24:32] <pky_mine> what is this the overwatch devs making a new map?
[2022-12-22 03:24:36] <%sullensunshine> are you gonna get more food delivered?
[2022-12-22 03:24:36] <%+dankdogedude> waffle house isnt
[2022-12-22 03:24:36] <%+Stronks3715> I've had my food stolen so many times
[2022-12-22 03:24:38] <%+dankdogedude> waffle house doesnt close
[2022-12-22 03:24:38] <WizardLemon_> Obviously its different for mr.strimmer
[2022-12-22 03:24:39] <+RacketyGnome300> McDonalds NEVER closes
[2022-12-22 03:24:41] <%IronAddictKidd> why is everything closed around you?

[2022-12-22 03:26:03] <+RacketyGnome300> I hate how this driver is dictating if you eat tonight or not... def report her
[2022-12-22 03:26:06] <%AAstroGamess> this man works fast
[2022-12-22 03:26:14] <%quickburn619> BTW.. if you ever order from "BurgerDen".. it's actually a virtual storefront from Denny's.

[2022-12-22 19:08:07] <notequal_exe> yeah and what's interesting about that is there is a large amount of the playerbase who don't even follow streamers and pros. so it's not just that influence.

[2022-12-22 19:08:15] <ziontf> Lootboxes did work tho?

[2022-12-22 19:28:41] <%SkitzoCTRL> @dnegus Her Rally takes like 10 minutes to charge. It has the largest build-up of every hero, tied with Moira, but she doesn't have the benefit of being able to provide a ton of healing like Moira.
[2022-12-22 19:28:41] <+oscargal53> Never underestimate the stupidity of hackers
[2022-12-22 19:28:44] <%bighawk457> i saw a cheater in genji ball
[2022-12-22 19:28:44] <%CassiHikari> I had a soldier in overwatch 1 that had his aimbot to full tilted rage mode, in a qp game
[2022-12-22 19:28:45] <dnegus> Everyone so scared now lol got their profiles private n shit

[2022-12-22 19:29:19] <oztw> @tsukuyomi418 bundles are instant unlock, battlepass you need to grind to unlock. so basically you pay more for the instant unlock

I am sure that some people would have liked the mythic junker queen skin to be at the shop for lime 3000 coins instead of the battlepass for 1000 and than grind for weeks

[2022-12-22 20:20:17] <@%^StreamElements> When Flats was in high school he joined the football team. Within his first week there, someone else on the team ended up crossing a line and pissing Flats off. Flats flattened the kid with his 6ft body, thus earning him the nickname "Flats" since "Flatten" sounds stupid.
[2022-12-22 20:20:21] <mrwang30> If youre on pc and switch to console with youre account how does competetive work? Are you queued with other top 500 players on console?

[2022-12-22 21:34:52] <%$TeaHauss> My favorite part about the ranked system is I dont hear anyone complaining about being hardstuck anymore
[2022-12-22 21:34:59] <+itsclearlydavid> Always drop the healing station before ulting with soldier

[2022-12-22 23:29:13] <%sofishdekat> @modestghost service at taco bell ranges from decent to awful. It's incredible at how bad a lot of the places are managed and how bad that experience is.
[2022-12-22 23:29:18] <Strattekun> Are we still on the coffee-in-bag story?

[2022-12-22 23:30:03] <%sofishdekat> @modestghost I always order on the app to remove the headdesk of trying to order something more complicated than a #3 with a pepsi, and even then they manage to make it a bad experience
