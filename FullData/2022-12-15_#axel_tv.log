[2022-12-15 17:43:41] <%Qweets> @eetsheet it will be connected in some way but I don't think enough where your progress in main tarkov will matter. It has to be a game that can stand alone since it's a stand alone game client seperate from tarkov

If they accept, both participants say !roll to roll a number. The higher roll wins, and the lower roll gets a time out. Ties are a reroll.
