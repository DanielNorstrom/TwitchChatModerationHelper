[2022-12-24 11:48:44] <%PanicRush> is +13 really such a huge step up from +12?
[2022-12-24 11:49:01] <%PanicRush> literally not a single group can get past the 1st boss in any dungeon
[2022-12-24 11:52:07] <%Geoffku> that bad? monkaS

[2022-12-24 11:56:48] <%Swiggyswoo_> COS last boss is intense though

[2022-12-24 11:57:15] <%Swiggyswoo_> Completely free dungeon then you get to last boss and it's like hitting the fkin tree boss in academy Weirdge

[2022-12-24 11:57:40] <%Taylor131313> 1st boss does nothing
[2022-12-24 11:57:48] <%Taylor131313> 2nd boss as long as you stack and clear imps fast it's fine

[2022-12-24 14:24:28] <vendettaw0w> The name comes from a time when the rich used to box up gifts to give to the poor. Boxing Day was traditionally a day off for servants - a day when they received a special Christmas box from their masters. The servants would also go home on Boxing Day to give Christmas boxes to their families.

[2022-12-24 14:26:35] <%drzaius30> Why is it called Boxing Day? The name Boxing Day comes from a time when rich people used to box the poor. Traditionally a day off for servants, these boxing matches would often involve money to trick people into betting. They would then go home on Boxing Day and have their families tend to their wounds. via wikipedia

[2022-12-24 14:43:16] <%KalleEinar> @anniefuchsia This is my first expansion for wow (new player here) - can you explain how the main story is connected between content. So I have played the main campaign (up to lev 70). Then I know that some campaign is unlocked through renown questing etc. And then you have main story content in e.g. raid cut scenes etc. To me it is a bit confusing - is there a chronological sequence of the story parts?

[2022-12-24 14:50:12] <+Cleavinseagal> root canal is way more common. Its not a mid life issue

[2022-12-24 14:50:49] <%Geoffku> yeah that's how fillings work
[2022-12-24 14:50:56] <%pwn7n7> Floride remineralizes your teeth
[2022-12-24 14:51:08] <%cascio94> @pwn7n7 KKonaW Florida?

[2022-12-24 14:51:10] <jacksplatt> US dentists would totally drill that and put in a filling
[2022-12-24 14:51:11] <%Geoffku> every time you get a filling they have to remove some tooth structure
[2022-12-24 14:51:14] <%pwn7n7> and acid does the opposite of floride
[2022-12-24 14:51:17] <Fanzer> Iciing?

[2022-12-24 14:51:23] <+Sqwabbles> Xylitol is a sweetener that is good for teeth but can upset stomach.

[2022-12-24 15:45:40] <+hedgebod> hi Annie! how do you know with the blizzard frames which enemy is aggroed by you?
[2022-12-24 15:45:56] VIEWERS: 1 354
[2022-12-24 15:46:27] <%+jfinazzo001> normal blizz frames glow red if its aggroed by you too
[2022-12-24 15:46:31] <+hedgebod> that always bothers me when I try it.. I really like it, but theres no way to tell
[2022-12-24 15:46:32] <%Taylor131313> I don't think you can with default frames
[2022-12-24 15:46:32] <%+jfinazzo001> its not as obvious
[2022-12-24 15:46:41] <%Dantalion> tidy plates shows this pretty well
[2022-12-24 15:46:44] <%Emerston> You can change color of threat threshhold in Plater
[2022-12-24 15:46:45] <%bYTEfROG> there is "display aggro highlight" setting
[2022-12-24 15:46:58] <unkindledtv> Plater helps with that, great addon
[2022-12-24 15:47:03] <+hedgebod> I used the display aggro highlight.. saw no differences
[2022-12-24 15:47:25] <+hedgebod> @unkindledtv I had to set the enemy frames to look like blizzard frames, but its not the same

[2022-12-24 16:19:50] <@%skibbatv> Instant evade doesn't happen when on unreachable terrain, instant evade only happens if a nearby mob was group tagged and evaded someone else, it shares the evade, or if you fly up in the air and they don't have ranged attack/spells to cast

[2022-12-24 16:22:42] <%Twigbot4k> Want to see hilarious evade?  There are some flying rares near the keep siege in Waking Shore.  You can pull them, and despite flying, able to reach ANY place, they can easily still enter an evading state.  And based on what I saw yesterday, stay evading forever.
[2022-12-24 16:22:43] <%Taylor131313> the only trinket I saw in 2 weeks is the infernal writ I got from the +8 we did with paige xdd

[2022-12-24 16:23:27] <%Twigbot4k> The flying rares appear to swap to land pathing once they touch down on land, sadly, becoming super easy to evade.

[2022-12-24 17:19:51] <Jonesy4> if everyone harpoons and nobody tags, everyone gets loot regardless of faction or party. if 1 person tags then only that group/person gets the loot. Atleast thats what I noticed when i did it, could be wrong

[2022-12-24 18:55:37] <Ingybingy> automatic, u lose nothing :D
[2022-12-24 18:56:42] <Archronos> how it would normally work here is that you'd fish here next to the lunker post you're beside now. when you loot a conch, you can start casting the looking for lunkers cast. when it finishes, a lunker can spawn, as a "free" one

[2022-12-24 19:05:49] <%Tenivir> you can fill it up by handing in fish or the quests
[2022-12-24 19:05:49] <%Ammbrus> i thought that was just for nets
[2022-12-24 19:05:59] <%+InsightfulRhino> the drop rate of EVERYTHING is affected by that

[2022-12-24 19:10:23] <%+InsightfulRhino> right here is the best for lunkers

[2022-12-24 19:10:53] <%+iTzFipi> quick question... is there any way to copy like the HUD from player to player? like if I wanted to play warlock and copy annie placements on screen for an example
[2022-12-24 19:11:01] <%+InsightfulRhino> the lava is great because the pools reaspawn fast AND they spawn teh bonus fishing pools really fast

[2022-12-24 19:14:17] <%+InsightfulRhino> removing the nets takes a huge chunk of the fishing hole, so if people are checking their blocked net spots it will take chunks from the available fish

[2022-12-24 23:05:42] <+Ylucis_Rhul> i think it was okey in the old times, when we lived on farms, and we gave them more freedom, but nowdays in houses, they are so depended on us, and we never gave them a choice, we just decided for them that its better, think about someone would come get you, put you in a house you cant leave, do all the other things for you, and say, yeah but its okey, she lives safe and lives longer XD
