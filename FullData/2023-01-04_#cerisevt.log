[2023-01-04 10:37:17] <!HawoooBakeinu> It is destroyable. But ever tried blowing up 20 cm reinforced steel with just an 18th century bomb?

[2023-01-04 11:23:10] <bunglinglummox> you should consider buying a new outfit, by the way, since everything after the starter 2 has buffs
[2023-01-04 11:24:11] <Lurkaar> @Codofwisdom I believe Roguelike refers to games with no meta progression, like the original Rogue game rikkuSit and Roguelites would refer to a lite version of Rogue, hence with meta progression to make the game easier
[2023-01-04 11:24:16] <Lurkaar> but don't quote me on that rikkuSit

[2023-01-04 11:39:59] <%Codofwisdom> I think this is one of those games that says "You don't need a health potion if you never get hit".
[2023-01-04 11:40:21] <bunglinglummox> I mean the game has edge protection. If you walk instead of dashing, you can't fall. You can get all the way to the edge safely.

[2023-01-04 12:34:20] <Rahsed> Well you got 3 scythes so 3 dragons should work in theory
[2023-01-04 12:34:21] <%MelonFox_> you can only get multiple dragons in the endless mode, but you can get infinite dragons there!

[2023-01-04 12:35:38] <%MelonFox_> @Reishella same genre, it's better imo ceriNODDERS
[2023-01-04 12:35:39] VIEWERS: 185
[2023-01-04 12:35:43] <%Codofwisdom> Definitely the same genre.
[2023-01-04 12:35:46] <Rahsed> Yeah that was basically first Vampire Survivors clone that came out
[2023-01-04 12:36:10] <Reishella> well its nost as flashy and laggy so am okay with it
[2023-01-04 12:36:11] <%Codofwisdom> It has both auto-aim and manual aiming, which is a nice add.
[2023-01-04 12:36:12] <%$Memil03> Ye i think i would chose vampire survivor over this game
[2023-01-04 12:36:49] <%$Memil03> And bitrate really dont like vampire survior xD
[2023-01-04 12:36:50] <Rahsed> @Reishella Sometimes too much, I wish it had at least one more color for clarity LUL
[2023-01-04 12:37:04] <!%$Pikinator> I love Boneraiser Minions in this genre
[2023-01-04 12:37:12] <%MelonFox_> I actually haven't played vamp survs once since I found this game lol
[2023-01-04 12:37:18] <Reishella> welp sometimes thats the price you pay for better fps
[2023-01-04 12:37:40] VIEWERS: 185
[2023-01-04 12:37:57] <Rahsed> I mean the upside of Vampire Survovors getting a lot of games of the same type is that there's something for everyone
[2023-01-04 12:38:02] <Reishella> and you gotta account at the very least some color blind people
[2023-01-04 12:38:21] <Reishella> even Jacksepticeye falls into this too I think

[2023-01-04 12:38:56] <jaydarkberry> lightning sounds good

[2023-01-04 14:58:43] <%wagnus> I played this a little, and definitely felt the same. I think I played it for an hour too, which might be the perfect quantity of time for this
[2023-01-04 14:58:49] <%wagnus> without getting overtly frustrated
[2023-01-04 14:58:50] <Reishella> well its a game of careful observation if you ask me
[2023-01-04 14:58:52] <nppolter> watching you play this, just makes me want to watch you play "mortuary assisstant"
[2023-01-04 14:59:08] <Reishella> soooo, not surprising its hard

[2023-01-04 14:59:11] <nppolter> ohhh is the vod still up?
[2023-01-04 14:59:14] <%Zobota> was that a shadow or blood on your floor?
[2023-01-04 14:59:25] <%GarmrUSAF> why is there a dead body in your room?
[2023-01-04 14:59:26] <+TheSwains> Graveyard gate has moved not sure you got rhat

[2023-01-04 14:59:39] <soulsteller4> hello there
[2023-01-04 14:59:55] <Reishella> I just wonder if you can actually die but tthat'd probably get tiresome and pointless like FNAF
[2023-01-04 15:00:10] <soulsteller4> much different start time than normal

[2023-01-04 15:00:17] <@%TheKneecapKnabber> the gate on the graveyard is closed instead of open
[2023-01-04 15:00:22] <+TheSwains> @reishella If you don't scare away the entity in your room he kills you, but that's the only way, you don't die from missing events
[2023-01-04 15:00:54] <+TheSwains> the entity is in your room
[2023-01-04 15:00:59] <+TheSwains> find his demony ass
[2023-01-04 15:01:01] <Reishella> I don't trust the timer, am sure you're more tthan online than 20 minutes
