[2022-12-30 03:17:19] <%myndzi> dnk2 dnk6
[2022-12-30 04:11:54] <%Slam_fan> dnkTinyb dnkThrow  dnkOhNo
[2022-12-30 04:24:18] <%myndzi> now i lay me down to sleep, i pray the lord my streak to keep. if chase should throw before i wake, i play the lord my streak to take
[2022-12-30 04:43:06] <%Slam_fan> When you get a 30+ streak going, need to resist the temptation and skip out on a lot of bets. It can be difficult at times! I did not expect to get this high in less than a year watching.
[2022-12-30 04:43:31] <%myndzi> i already know that, i hadn't bet in like a week and a half :)
[2022-12-30 04:43:45] <%myndzi> yesterday was a pretty safe bet, just unlucky
[2022-12-30 04:43:52] <%Slam_fan> lol what's your streak at?
[2022-12-30 04:43:53] <%shamwhoa> I am always dnkTinyb
[2022-12-30 04:43:57] <%myndzi> -1
[2022-12-30 04:44:14] <%myndzi> it _was_ 26 :P
[2022-12-30 04:44:53] <%Slam_fan> did he actually throw yesterday? I am so sorry lol. I was actually listening from bed and if I didn't have to get out of bed probably would have bet
[2022-12-30 04:44:59] <%myndzi> he had been making riskier bets because he didn't want too many wins until the event
[2022-12-30 04:45:11] <%myndzi> yeah, poly death while farming chest or something
[2022-12-30 04:45:49] <%Slam_fan> oh yeah but before falling asleep i remember he said a death would end a bet, so that was a tough bet
[2022-12-30 04:45:58] <%myndzi> not really
[2022-12-30 04:46:07] <%myndzi> he's done this multiple times, and he always gets paranoid OP
[2022-12-30 04:46:18] <%myndzi> the main downside was the length of th erun
[2022-12-30 04:46:41] <%myndzi> risky bets are heavy RNG or easy runs
[2022-12-30 04:46:42] <%Slam_fan> yeah it's always risky to bet on a long run
[2022-12-30 04:46:54] <%myndzi> but most of his dailies are long runs tbh
[2022-12-30 04:47:06] <%myndzi> and the goal wasn't a difficult one
[2022-12-30 04:47:14] <%myndzi> a long run with a difficult goal is a bit scarier
[2022-12-30 04:47:22] <%Slam_fan> they're long because of his pace but usually not too complex
[2022-12-30 04:47:34] <%myndzi> right, same here though. not complex, just tedious
[2022-12-30 04:48:00] <%myndzi> the difference maker is it was the kind of run where he'll tryhard vs the kind of run where he'll fuck around and let chat talk him into fungal shifts because it's too easy ;)
[2022-12-30 04:48:01] <%Slam_fan> he had to get the barrier spell, and survive end of everything, right?
[2022-12-30 04:48:11] <%Slam_fan> in the correct location, so maybe multiple times
[2022-12-30 04:48:11] <%myndzi> he's survived end of everything tons of times
[2022-12-30 04:48:20] <%myndzi> barrier spell is long but not hard
[2022-12-30 04:49:01] <%myndzi> imo this was about as easy a win as i could hope for, but there's always a risk he just slips up
[2022-12-30 04:49:10] <%myndzi> that risk is the same in all runs though, and uncommon
[2022-12-30 04:49:31] <%Slam_fan> so how long did he last before he got poly'd? do u have a clip?
[2022-12-30 04:49:37] <%myndzi> i just looked at the vod earlier
[2022-12-30 04:49:40] <%myndzi> it was like the whole stream
[2022-12-30 04:49:42] <%myndzi> 5+ hours
[2022-12-30 04:49:48] <%Slam_fan> lmao
[2022-12-30 04:51:25] <%Slam_fan> What is your biggest win streak?
[2022-12-30 04:51:34] <%myndzi> this has gotta be it, or close
[2022-12-30 04:53:27] <%myndzi> yeah, previous was 20
[2022-12-30 04:54:53] <%myndzi> it's only recently i've been going for longer streaks
[2022-12-30 04:55:09] <%myndzi> before, after i hit a citb i'd bet more to get more sweat and because the cost of losing isn't much
[2022-12-30 04:55:09] <%Slam_fan> Then I am either really dnkBigb or really lucky dnkExtraLuck LUL maybe both
[2022-12-30 04:55:32] <%myndzi> both ;) restraint is key
[2022-12-30 04:55:45] <%myndzi> it's not about getting every bet right, it's about beting when you have a good chance of getting it right
[2022-12-30 04:56:46] <%Slam_fan> normally yes, but my point earlier was that the game really kinda changes at 30+, cause it will hurt extra after losing a streak like that
[2022-12-30 04:57:21] <%Slam_fan> I just recently started having to REALLY hold back on some tempting bets
[2022-12-30 04:57:22] <%myndzi> depends on your goal of course
[2022-12-30 04:57:43] <%myndzi> i don't really care much about a big streak, it's just something to pass the time
[2022-12-30 04:57:48] <%myndzi> i'd rather rack up more citbs ;)
[2022-12-30 04:58:04] <%myndzi> and you don't need a long streak for that, you need more bets
[2022-12-30 04:58:15] <%Slam_fan> I didn't expect to get to 30+, but I do expect it will be my only time with a streak this high LUL
[2022-12-30 04:58:28] <%myndzi> the main reason i've been more judicious is not because i was approaching 30 but because i was approaching 28
[2022-12-30 04:59:24] <%Slam_fan> yeah I get that, totally
[2022-12-30 05:00:12] <%ItsTheFrank> dnkLate ?
[2022-12-30 05:02:11] <%Slam_fan> but now I have still 4 more to my next citb, and I'm skipping bets I would normally not hesitate so much about. It feels different, kind of annoying, because like you said the citb accumulation rate goes down
[2022-12-30 05:03:01] <%myndzi> know what'd be super trolly?
[2022-12-30 05:03:07] <%myndzi> add incremental mechanics to dunkbot
[2022-12-30 05:03:18] <%myndzi> so you could spend your sweat / citb on things that give you passive sweat / citb over time
[2022-12-30 05:03:27] <%myndzi> but make the accumulation rate actually worse than if you just didn't
[2022-12-30 05:03:29] <%myndzi> Kappa
[2022-12-30 05:04:45] <%Slam_fan> worse than not watching or betting?
[2022-12-30 05:05:13] <%myndzi> something trolly like a logarithmic increase
[2022-12-30 05:05:23] <%myndzi> the more you have the less you gain
[2022-12-30 05:06:10] <%myndzi> i actually do think a mini incremental is where things could head though
[2022-12-30 05:06:24] <%myndzi> myndzi owns 26 treadmills!
[2022-12-30 05:06:24] <%Slam_fan> it would be kinda lame if you could invest your sweat and earn large returns, so something like your're suggesting sounds reasonable
[2022-12-30 05:06:58] <%myndzi> well incrementals are all about tradeoffs between fixed costs and rate of gain
[2022-12-30 05:07:21] <%myndzi> like, maybe you'd have to spend a million sweat to get a treadmill, and the treadmill would give you sweat at a rate that would only recoup your investment after 6 months
[2022-12-30 05:07:54] <%myndzi> i don't know anything about balancing incrementals, but usually the decision-making part of them is that you have to choose between resources, especially resources that don't behave the same way
[2022-12-30 05:08:03] <%myndzi> if you only have one resource (sweat) it's pretty straightforward
[2022-12-30 05:08:16] <%myndzi> but for a stream side-game that could be fine
[2022-12-30 05:09:11] <%Slam_fan> Sounds ok SeemsGood but at his rate of development we'll see it in 5+ years?
[2022-12-30 05:09:12] <%myndzi> there are things you can do to hedge against problems; for example, gain could be reduced by "time since last chat"
[2022-12-30 05:09:42] <%myndzi> then the "production" would taper off to 0 for inactive chatters
[2022-12-30 05:09:44] <%Slam_fan> actually it sounds pretty easy to implement at a basic level
[2022-12-30 05:09:49] <%myndzi> it is :)
[2022-12-30 05:09:53] <%Slam_fan> so maybe 1 year
[2022-12-30 05:10:10] <%myndzi> more like a few hours if i get the basic infrastructure laid in a maintainable way
[2022-12-30 05:10:23] <%myndzi> the bigger question is if it's worth it
[2022-12-30 05:10:40] <%myndzi> probably the best way to approach it is not to feed back into sweat balance, but to have a new resource you can spend sweat (or citbs) to generate
[2022-12-30 05:10:52] <%myndzi> and that new resource could serve no purpose other than dick swinging
[2022-12-30 05:10:58] <%myndzi> then it becomes a sink on the sweat inflation lol
[2022-12-30 05:11:13] <%myndzi> and we can defer any decisions about whether we want it to reward people until later
[2022-12-30 05:11:29] <%myndzi> the nice thing about passive "income" via gamification is it works against dunk's complaints about twitch channel point gain
[2022-12-30 05:11:37] <%myndzi> anyone can get it, sub or not, at the same rate
[2022-12-30 05:11:57] <%myndzi> and it also actually provides a nice alternative for people who can't make every stream or watch all the time etc
[2022-12-30 05:13:37] <%myndzi> there's lots of integrations you can do with existing channel culture too
[2022-12-30 05:13:53] <%myndzi> imagine accruing hidden weeb points :P
[2022-12-30 05:14:39] <%shamwhoa> !quack
[2022-12-30 05:14:56] <%myndzi> ... or ducks
[2022-12-30 05:15:01] <%shamwhoa> can i get honkcoin implemented? to increase my luck for quacking
[2022-12-30 05:15:20] <%Slam_fan> now that's a good idea
[2022-12-30 05:15:56] <%myndzi> myndzi has 1023 bread crumbs

[2022-12-30 05:50:59] <%Slam_fan> Well I am glad I voted !maybe LoL

[2022-12-30 06:43:39] <%scobunk> @dunkorslam I think you should set multiple goals per run because some of them will just be speedruns. Maybe split the 71 pillars between all runs?

[2022-12-30 06:45:12] <%Kerr1291> Cheer100 agree. is there a lots of pillars option where you live?
[2022-12-30 06:45:22] <Lordwootman> basically a speedrun off all achievements/pillers

[2022-12-30 06:45:37] <%Crysyn> So you want to toss a NoHit run out the window because you cant make it to the boss in <5m ??? Cheer100 Go for it, sounds awesome, what were the other 3 runs we will never get to see? :)
[2022-12-30 06:46:03] <%xurxo__> @DunkOrSlam can you do the 2nd option first then a couple streams later do the 65 pillar
[2022-12-30 06:46:09] <%+Marseliko> do you belive you can do it
[2022-12-30 06:46:13] <%scobunk> @dunkorslam read me I have an alternate idea for option 2
[2022-12-30 06:46:16] VIEWERS: 227
[2022-12-30 06:46:21] <%maghoy> if you could make it to the boss in less than 5 metres, that'd be impressive
[2022-12-30 06:46:21] <%Slam_fan> What about the 1 minute run?
[2022-12-30 06:46:49] <%Omnipotent_0> 1 minute random seed almost impossible
[2022-12-30 06:46:50] <%Crysyn> If you do a 5min no hit no gold pacifist run, does that count as 4 of em??? :)

[2022-12-30 07:20:27] <%Omnipotent_0> Dunk thinking he can complete 5 minute pillar in under 5 mins, okay
[2022-12-30 07:20:30] <%InfidelCastro1> what about a run where you have fun and enjoy yourself?
[2022-12-30 07:20:39] <%Omnipotent_0> @InfidelCastro1 thats what the channel is for

[2022-12-30 07:20:45] <%+Wckdneer> @InfidelCastro1 he ruined our streaks
[2022-12-30 07:20:48] <%+dusty_sprinkles> no gold is almost a no HM run
[2022-12-30 07:20:49] <%+Tristan_Compton> @DunkOrSlam do a run with only spark bolt to damage enemies Kappa
[2022-12-30 07:20:50] <%Televis10n> are these sequentially without failure in between?

[2022-12-30 07:21:20] <%$nohugsforyou1> 69

[2022-12-30 07:21:30] <%+carniera> @DunkOrSlam for the right option, what happens if you dont die, but you're over the 5 minute time limit? Start THAT challenge over? Or start over from no hit?
[2022-12-30 07:21:31] <%nouky_73> what is the bet plan if option 2?
[2022-12-30 07:21:42] <%smily277353> Option 1

[2022-12-30 07:22:07] <%wtchingstrms> 3.5 is too short
[2022-12-30 07:22:12] <%+Wckdneer> number 1 is so much more interesting

[2022-12-30 07:22:14] <%Omnipotent_0> 3.5 way too short
[2022-12-30 07:22:15] <%myndzi> @carniera i think the idea was that the order is flexible, so he has up to 5 attempts at 5 mins
[2022-12-30 07:22:15] <%nolava> Cowards way out, you control your own actions!
[2022-12-30 07:22:16] <%+boywisard> option 2 seems way harder
[2022-12-30 07:22:16] <%$mcgrundlesnatch> Option 1! That would be an legendary run
[2022-12-30 07:22:18] <@%DunkBot> Shop item: Black Robe dunkbin.com/backpack/0/?text=blackrobe
[2022-12-30 07:22:20] <One_Who_Walks_Silly> Option 2 but all the runs have to be under 5 minutes
[2022-12-30 07:22:23] <%+dusty_sprinkles> @DunkOrSlam Read me

[2022-12-30 07:22:50] <%Sunforest> 1 gold pixel is all it takes to reset
[2022-12-30 07:22:52] <%+RNGrizzly> Dunk is so desperately trying to sway the vote to #2, his preference is obvious, which means we have to vote #1
[2022-12-30 07:22:56] <%megaRoan> @DunkOrSlam Can you do three of those atreevments in one run? No hit ... Pacifist ... No gold
[2022-12-30 07:22:59] <%Mikemage> @WaxNumen good :)
[2022-12-30 07:23:04] <%+Wckdneer> @WaxNumen exactly, he'll never do it,. he'll die and pay for losing our streaks
[2022-12-30 07:23:04] <%C1ic> if you die or fail the rin
[2022-12-30 07:23:05] <+jeremy_claude> What if you do more than one at once for the 2nd?
[2022-12-30 07:23:06] <%+carniera> @DunkOrSlam just die or fail counts as a death for the speed runs too?
[2022-12-30 07:23:10] <%+Razrquine> KEKW
[2022-12-30 07:23:11] <%Detuskified_Walrus> my vote is for 2 lol

[2022-12-30 07:23:13] <%Slam_fan> I thought option 2 included option 1
[2022-12-30 07:23:15] <%SweetMeatMilkSweat> wasting letaali's planning efforts NOPERS
[2022-12-30 07:23:16] <%Spiritsmaker> How about you include using the mod in EoE? @DunkOrSlam
[2022-12-30 07:23:16] <acerbusvorpal> I see a problem with option 2; you'll get multiple wins that go past 1600.
[2022-12-30 07:23:18] <%nolava> So chat the first one involves having to cast EOE on a pixel perfect spot 14 times! FOuRTEEN
[2022-12-30 07:23:18] <%Teh_Weltschmerz> option 2 should have and extra "4 wins in a straight row of ti" for extra challenge
[2022-12-30 07:23:19] <One_Who_Walks_Silly> Bruh option 2 sounds impossible hahaha
[2022-12-30 07:23:19] <+Bumsunite> 1
[2022-12-30 07:23:20] <%Ephemeris__> 2 is better viewing. and healthier.

[2022-12-30 07:23:23] <%Omnipotent_0> @WaxNumen I'm well aware, and yet my choice is still the same :)
[2022-12-30 07:23:23] <%+Andestrious> option 2 sounds a lot more enjoyable to watch

[2022-12-30 07:24:46] <%$nohugsforyou1> Truth
[2022-12-30 07:24:51] <One_Who_Walks_Silly> @peterce3 that makes a lot of sens
[2022-12-30 07:24:53] <%+Wckdneer> Option 1 is truly a statement to destroying noita, hence its more interesting to me
[2022-12-30 07:24:55] <%WaxNumen> Slippery sloping like made OMEGALUL Also he has chainsaw audio fix sideloaded right now
[2022-12-30 07:25:00] <%+Andestrious> option 2 sounds a lot more enjoyable to watch and probably less tedious
[2022-12-30 07:25:01] <%InfidelCastro1> option 1 but you use the pinball mod
[2022-12-30 07:25:04] <%WUOTE> @myndzi PotEyes
[2022-12-30 07:25:05] <%nolava> So remember chat- that means 14 times having to do mod restart for pixel perfect EOE

[2022-12-30 07:25:26] <destravous> @DunkOrSlam if you do the 24hr one, please please split it across multiple streams if it goes on long. Lack of sleep can cause permanent brain damage
[2022-12-30 07:25:28] <%C1ic> let's go with option 2 but with an auto shift mod added to it
[2022-12-30 07:25:30] <One_Who_Walks_Silly> Only QOL mod so your chainsaw doesn’t break audio lmao
[2022-12-30 07:25:31] <%Dingleberry_Scrub> option 2 gets us to NT faster LUL
[2022-12-30 07:25:33] <%WaxNumen> @Sky______King No it's possible, it's just an auto GoldSnooze
[2022-12-30 07:25:34] <%Omnipotent_0> @nolava Not just pixel perfect, he MUST stay at the EXACT same coordinate. And he can get screwed right off the bat on EoE

[2022-12-30 07:25:52] <%megaRoan> @DunkOrSlam Can you do three of those atreevments in one run? No hit ... Pacifist ... No gold
[2022-12-30 07:25:53] <%$VeeohTV> @DunkOrSlam What are the estimated times with deaths?

[2022-12-30 07:26:02] <%wtchingstrms> where do we vote?
[2022-12-30 07:26:06] <Jereaux> If you get hit during a no hit run, do you have to finish the run then start over? Or does it reset like a death?

[2022-12-30 07:30:15] <MotionMonroe> there should be a stipulation for option 1, if you die long into, for your health and sanity roll to option 2 or something else cause option 1 could be like 48hrs dude

[2022-12-30 07:30:17] <%+RNGrizzly> @DunkOrSlam Fundamentally, Option 2 is untenable because it's 5 wins, making this the 1604 Win event stream
[2022-12-30 07:30:17] <%Naicii> The no hit run is the first run though, so you just reset the no hit runs until you win one right?
[2022-12-30 07:30:17] <%$VeeohTV> @DunkOrSlam How about a no hit Soler TI run? 󠀀

And I thought to myself "I already have a Baka Hat, I don't need to continue my negative streak."  Then @DunkOrSlam said today was a normal daily run, and I thought "this is perfect for getting back on track for a positive streak."  Guess I've been proven wrong for believing once again.]

[2022-12-30 10:22:08] <%WaxNumen> Use spark double trigger Madge It digs better and is pretty
[2022-12-30 10:22:09] <thecatquiconnaitpassesmdp> infinite digging already ?
[2022-12-30 10:22:12] <%+dusty_sprinkles> @DunkOrSlam can you promise you'll use a double trigger instead of a single spark trigger tomorrow if you find one. You know, the blue one. Be a lot cooler if you did
[2022-12-30 10:22:17] <Smetanol_> do "allways cast" consume mana?

[2022-12-30 10:22:36] <ArthurAshford> @Smetanol_ nope, but they do add cast delay and recharge time

[2022-12-30 10:23:43] <Smetanol_> @ArthurAshford interesting. and is it earliest or latest in the list (can it be a projectile for example?). I assume it's earliest in cast
[2022-12-30 10:23:43] <%Rytingur> it does not cost mana
[2022-12-30 10:23:44] <thecatquiconnaitpassesmdp> me when addmana adds mana
[2022-12-30 10:23:57] <%Letaali> add mana is a exception
[2022-12-30 10:24:01] <%auillolo02> cause an always cast add mana would be lame

[2022-12-30 12:04:58] <%+dusty_sprinkles> I think as long as a fresh file wouldn't add too much time we should do it
[2022-12-30 12:05:00] <ZaximusRex> It's not the 1600th win if you reset your file
