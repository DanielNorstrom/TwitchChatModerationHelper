[2022-12-23 01:14:20] <!%Bisholio> just cuz of the move speed?
[2022-12-23 01:14:24] <!%Bisholio> curious why

[2022-12-23 01:16:40] <%Theraxisz> was going to make it this league but poison srs made everything stupid expensive for a half-ass build LUL

[2022-12-23 01:17:38] <!%Bisholio> i actually POBd a poison soulwrest build that does 11m on paper, but i think it does closer to the 35m cap cuz of projectile shotgunning

[2022-12-23 01:18:45] <%Theraxisz> @Bisholio temp chains with an occultist inflates a little bit, but it's prob still in the 20-25m range
[2022-12-23 01:19:15] <!%Bisholio> seems pretty good
[2022-12-23 01:19:26] <%Theraxisz> I haven't played with gear to get a third curse in 3.2 yet, then you could re-enable sniper's mark and get THICC

[2022-12-23 01:33:35] <!%Bisholio> cuz the ballistas themselves need them

[2022-12-23 02:03:51] <BalorMage> I'm considering a scion reroll.  res gets a bit harder.  but other than all res scion gets everything you need from necro.  plus guardian.
[2022-12-23 02:03:55] <%LordTekkless> but dans reasons were questionable
[2022-12-23 02:04:33] <BalorMage> I think if I get a mageblood I go scion.   because mageblood fixes res issues scion has.
[2022-12-23 02:04:33] <%+killermorph> scion might be better?

[2022-12-23 18:15:00] <%LordTekkless> you want packsize
[2022-12-23 18:15:02] <%LordTekkless> with breach
[2022-12-23 18:15:04] <just_bees__> but really what's a percentage
[2022-12-23 18:15:09] <%dcirusc30> white t1 strands  YEP
[2022-12-23 18:15:09] <%Nite01> the problem is you need blessings

[2022-12-23 18:15:14] <%Nite01> otherwise they are worthless
[2022-12-23 18:15:31] <%Useless_Eater> blessings are mainly from running the breachstones tho
[2022-12-23 18:15:45] <%LordTekkless> yea
[2022-12-23 18:15:47] <%LordTekkless> the bosses
[2022-12-23 18:15:50] <%Useless_Eater> you cant expect every breachstone to be maxed out
[2022-12-23 18:15:53] VIEWERS: 424
[2022-12-23 18:15:55] <sakten> breaches is profitable if you can do hidden invintations
[2022-12-23 18:16:01] <Naxalite_> @Nightbot wtf is this even

[2022-12-23 18:16:22] <%Nite01> those are the rates
[2022-12-23 18:16:50] <%Nite01> its like 7 blessings total for like 30 stones
[2022-12-23 18:17:00] <Heggzigu> Breach is profitable if you can easily kill everything in range while opening all the chests
[2022-12-23 18:17:12] <%Nite01> and you need 3x for each
[2022-12-23 18:17:15] <Heggzigu> The Chosen card is profitable imo (and drops rather often from said clasped hands)
