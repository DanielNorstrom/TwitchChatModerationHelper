[2023-01-07 18:35:10] <@%MusicalGlaceon> i see overwatch has changed a lot :]
[2023-01-07 18:35:33] <%zornamix> walljump is so rng for me sometimes  and its just hard for me to pull off at times when i need to do it
[2023-01-07 18:35:50] <@%MusicalGlaceon> thoughts on making ball's jump height higher by default?
[2023-01-07 18:36:15] <@%MusicalGlaceon> because thats a change i see them trying
[2023-01-07 18:36:18] <%zornamix> it could possibly ruin his walljump

[2023-01-07 18:37:01] <%zornamix> i have a feeling that it would because lucio speed boost makes it wayy harder to walljump
