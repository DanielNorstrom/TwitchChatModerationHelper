[2022-12-19 12:14:03] <%+MakingThemRage__> surely the integra's brakes in the snow is the worst combo you can get
[2022-12-19 12:14:08] <!%daarth_odyssey> so same would happen with the rest i assume
[2022-12-19 12:14:12] <almirshaqiri> does the snow affect the performance
[2022-12-19 12:14:20] <%toster_noodle> it would get nerfed the next day

[2022-12-19 15:34:43] <vishu93> dragonav only for helis i think
[2022-12-19 15:34:45] <silentknight222> Draganov only for heli is good
[2022-12-19 15:34:46] <%July_Dee> The big guns power in the rig don't equal their real power
[2022-12-19 15:34:50] <xxuranium7xx> Dragunov is basically only for killing the gunners on the chopper
[2022-12-19 15:34:58] <+ZinoStreamz> Druganov good for helis

[2022-12-19 15:36:51] <!%daarth_odyssey> like the generator hack with the numbers
[2022-12-19 15:36:52] <luks10s> its pretty easy as far as hacks go
[2022-12-19 15:36:56] <abdul2142> find out in rp
[2022-12-19 15:36:56] <Itami7> The pieces have different values
[2022-12-19 15:36:59] <maikyy96> every piece stands for a certain amount of steps
[2022-12-19 15:37:04] <xxuranium7xx> chess is basically like the generator hack but instead of numbers , the pieces have values
[2022-12-19 15:37:08] <%Doyler175> Each one has a number value and its all steps to the end
[2022-12-19 15:37:08] <!%daarth_odyssey> one of the easier ones
[2022-12-19 15:37:08] <niszmo9> It’s like real chess values on moves

[2022-12-19 15:38:36] <%lufc_jamie> it makes sense if youve seen the number one first
[2022-12-19 15:38:44] <maikyy96> @lufc_jamie yeah
[2022-12-19 15:38:44] <luks10s> you memorize the pieces
[2022-12-19 15:38:51] <%toster_noodle> Ask Matt for the cheat sheet#
[2022-12-19 15:38:52] <%Doyler175> You can practice in paleto tbf
[2022-12-19 15:38:53] <%pixeled12> @CxGray you have to move that amount of squares
[2022-12-19 15:38:57] <%CrispyTunaLuis> hmmmmmmm
[2022-12-19 15:39:07] <+ashy2bashy> Its easier to learn on the number one instead of the chess one
[2022-12-19 15:39:07] <%CrispyTunaLuis> why did you shoot the lights? LOOL
[2022-12-19 15:39:11] <tobias_twitch_> it is a cheet sheet with the equivalent numbers to pieces
[2022-12-19 15:39:13] <%July_Dee> you move right or down until that green suare
[2022-12-19 15:39:18] <%parthjain28> like he used pawn to reach horse and then horse 2 times to get to the red one like a puzzle
[2022-12-19 15:39:20] <pratik_vyas> Every piece is assigned number of blocks it can go.
[2022-12-19 15:39:22] <NonStopGam3r> youse have had good progress
[2022-12-19 15:39:27] <%Axelancee> it looks bare easy icl LUL just know the assigned the number
