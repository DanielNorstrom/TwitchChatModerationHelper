[2023-01-07 07:52:05] <%+dryholaos> What is the history of Namalsk? Why isn't it part of the vanilla game if it's made by one of the devs?
[2023-01-07 07:52:08] <+kalorulez> ive played dzsa launcher but they always just boosted beyond fun
[2023-01-07 07:52:14] <%ilovetreez420> namalsk is a mod
[2023-01-07 07:52:47] <%im_Pinkk> It also has many stalker assets so it cannot be official without infringement
[2023-01-07 07:52:48] <+kalorulez> but how do u get on these active servers
[2023-01-07 07:52:50] <river_335n54> Namalsk should be offical by now
[2023-01-07 07:52:56] <+kitchenthinks> @kalorulez haha, what are you talking about? DZSA is a server browser, all types on there
[2023-01-07 07:53:07] <epicgamingect> Vanilla --- no plus,s only negatives are the hardcore servers
[2023-01-07 07:53:10] <%+dryholaos> @im_Pinkk maybe but aren't the stalker assets public domain now?

[2023-01-07 07:53:52] <%+SlotRacer> @kalorulez and the launcher tells you server population
[2023-01-07 07:53:57] <%+dryholaos> You sure? I thought that's how we're able to have all these stalker mods
[2023-01-07 07:54:22] <%im_Pinkk> Mods are free. You start charging money, you got problems
[2023-01-07 07:54:23] <epicgamingect> just like everything in DayZ public domain and this is why we have community servers and mods and wait thirstily for the newer assets from Arma 3
[2023-01-07 07:54:45] <%+dryholaos> Hmmm
[2023-01-07 07:54:53] <river_335n54> Stalker servers got outdated real quick!

[2023-01-07 08:01:18] <epicgamingect> @ImpLoaf i think it was a moral objective that the survivors have too raid and kill the bases inhabitants as they are cannibals who feed on freshies

[2023-01-07 08:06:25] <epicgamingect> all you need is a ghillie suite and a dead zombie too make or you have too get Netting and rope and a dead zombie too make and it has 1 minute of use befor iut degrades and is ruined and loses effect
[2023-01-07 08:06:42] <tiger_8866> still alive same char?

[2023-01-07 20:28:14] <intenzohani> Hey Caremor, if u had the original black plate in the fight b4, u would have killed all of them :D

[2023-01-07 20:28:55] <pizzainretirement> dont blame them for making mistakes, just laugh about it
[2023-01-07 20:28:58] <%+donnydurrr> You should post preferred rules on Twitter so everybody can just copy and paste each time and things they don't think about are covered

[2023-01-07 20:54:07] <iwobbler> in the rules it only specifies body guards and vips that you can streamsnipe. Weird people were in your stream.
[2023-01-07 20:54:16] <%+The_Venom_Inside> are defenders allowed to stream snipe attackers?
[2023-01-07 20:54:18] <+URSO_GRELHA> we get them in the next time LUL

[2023-01-07 21:52:29] <+mangoatdotnet> The AUG was made in Austria which is Hitler's birth place which makes it inherently evil
[2023-01-07 21:52:42] <%mindlessness> aug has like 5 more damage per shot or something, pretty inconsequential compared to fire rate

[2023-01-07 21:54:25] <%mindlessness> the m4 shoots so much faster and the aug does such a small amount of extra damage that the m4 is pretty much objectively better
[2023-01-07 21:54:35] <%mindlessness> they're of course both good and you can use either. the aug is for sure cooler.
