Reformation still grows and in 1480 when you started converting it already was probably around 80%

[2022-12-23 16:18:54] <efes__> @ruustle my understanding is that 1) you need make trib peace offer; you select it 2) you select provinces to take from the target, the make trib CB's cost gets lowered 3) you unclick the make trib peace offer — because you're not allowed to take clay without tributizing, everything gets unclicked, but 4) the game calculates the refund wrong, and refunds you too many demand-points, thus dropping you into negative. 5) repeat until you have enough negative demands
