[2023-01-10 15:23:10] <jAmzye> @thorisbadazz pretty obvious that hes cheating lmao
[2023-01-10 15:23:10] <+MrHappy27> I was talking to a guy who used cheats in Tarkov and said he would make 20k a month selling crap
[2023-01-10 15:23:10] <%onetwueduwubie> i would shame my friends beyond belief if i found out they were cheating lol

[2023-01-10 15:23:41] <toffeestv> I actually read an article once that many mainstream chinese players at pc bangs dont see it as cheating, its just "getting an edge" something you'd do irl so why not in game. *barf*
[2023-01-10 15:23:45] <+Trrap> bro some of yall got weird energy lmao
[2023-01-10 15:23:45] <thedirtiestlick> NGL i think its more of the.......i dont wanna work for it

[2023-01-10 15:23:49] <archexxe> Nah I don't think thats why they cheat, they cheat just to feel overpowered, plain and simple and beat anyone without effort. Got nothing to do with "looking good"
[2023-01-10 15:23:49] <%thorisbadazz> I saw your brother going in on Twitter lol
[2023-01-10 15:23:53] <+flava_dave11> probably better off with the current state of audio

[2023-01-10 15:25:35] <45ustink> Stop cheating

[2023-01-10 15:25:48] <45ustink> I wonder y
[2023-01-10 15:25:51] <Riot613> It's like that for anyone who has talent or who put any effort in. All pro athletes are on steroids and all good gamers cheat. It's easier for simple minded ppl to think that way
[2023-01-10 15:25:51] <+omacdonald> it's also so obvious your inventives are not to cheat when you have good success on twitch, like why jeopardize that
[2023-01-10 15:25:51] <djyoo7> ignore the haters
[2023-01-10 15:25:59] <%onetwueduwubie> dude's a troll that's been saying that since stream started lol

[2023-01-10 15:26:10] <%+captf1shyf1nger> but i also think it has to do with a lot of new players right now who dont understand tarkov

[2023-01-10 15:51:45] <%+Petrickery> when they made it so killa can be found anywhere on interchange, he's much more terrifying imo. right after they made that change, he scared me so much right as I entered the mall
[2023-01-10 15:51:58] <%+C0LDLURK> They take him out like the next day after you killed him?

[2023-01-10 19:46:59] <stolen1123> he is not cheating he is just a good labs player u can see how he plays all day lab by is gameplay
[2023-01-10 19:46:59] <SonjiroTV> how much the Cottage key stands for? im always looking on flea market no one sells it
[2023-01-10 19:47:00] <MaJoR_DeLi> Wish I could get in a scav run and get a keychain. 10 minutes matching. NotLikeThis

[2023-01-10 23:41:03] <%NoBakez> i always do better with a duo or trio.. anything more is hecktic
[2023-01-10 23:41:08] <+ascii_160> Would it be good if matches were made on level +/-3 ?
[2023-01-10 23:41:10] <%tugghboat> 5 man teams are usually so loud too, if you have issues as a solo pick your fights better, 5 man's should not surprise tou
[2023-01-10 23:41:13] <%ArsonLt> i enjoy solo cause i dont rely on other people to watch something or sometimes they make to much noise and i cant hear if someone is far away
