[2022-12-31 12:51:08] <%drzaius30> anniesHi @Sne4ky79
[2022-12-31 12:56:14] <%Sne4ky79> i hade to go to sleep but was the conclusion last night? try hc on sunday?
[2022-12-31 12:58:24] <%Geoffku> possibly
[2022-12-31 12:58:29] <%Sne4ky79> the knock backs and 2nd platform seemed super rough
[2022-12-31 12:59:00] <%PanicRush> we killed that boss in the end
[2022-12-31 12:59:08] <%Sne4ky79> Pog
[2022-12-31 13:00:16] <%Sne4ky79> i dont think the stacks was the problem with that boss though even if tanks need to switch after 4 stacks
[2022-12-31 13:00:54] <%Sne4ky79> just healers keeping up and platform +knock backs
[2022-12-31 13:02:11] <%PanicRush> stacks increase knockback power
[2022-12-31 13:02:25] <%PanicRush> with 4 stacks a knockback yeets you off the platform
[2022-12-31 13:02:48] <%Sne4ky79> yes but tanks switch before that?
[2022-12-31 13:03:03] <%PanicRush> yes
[2022-12-31 13:03:31] <%Sne4ky79> i think next boss will be easier tbh
[2022-12-31 13:04:11] <%Wardrick7> Kurog is easier
[2022-12-31 13:04:41] <%Wardrick7> but after that will probably be a wall for a bit
[2022-12-31 13:07:05] <%Sne4ky79> 405-411 ilvl for the next ones?
[2022-12-31 13:07:55] <%Sne4ky79> or learning wall to learn the next hc bosses?
[2022-12-31 13:08:05] <%PanicRush> both
[2022-12-31 13:08:17] <%PanicRush> learning new mechanics and being better geared

[2022-12-31 13:09:33] <%Sne4ky79> on a good note spidey boss went quite smooth
[2022-12-31 13:09:50] <%Taylor131313> everyone did well because no one wanted to do that boss a second time xdd
[2022-12-31 13:09:55] <%PanicRush> yeah, about that... xdd
[2022-12-31 13:10:38] <%Geoffku> primal council is way worse than spider boss
[2022-12-31 13:11:19] <%Sne4ky79> no one likes spidey boss
[2022-12-31 13:11:41] <%Geoffku> at least I can hit the spider boss
[2022-12-31 13:11:55] <+Alastor7783> I like spider boss Madge
[2022-12-31 13:12:29] <%Geoffku> council i'm just wasting so much time at pillars getting reinfected
[2022-12-31 13:12:30] <%PanicRush> i hate spider boss because i cant hit it
[2022-12-31 13:12:34] <%PanicRush> such a scuffed hitbox
[2022-12-31 13:12:40] <%PanicRush> especially on the stairs
[2022-12-31 13:12:55] <%Sne4ky79> even me watching you all do spidey boss is like no heckin no LUL
[2022-12-31 13:13:14] <%PanicRush> literally standing inside the boss - Pepega "i need to get closer, too far away"
[2022-12-31 13:13:26] <%PanicRush> pure cancer as melee
[2022-12-31 13:13:39] <%PanicRush> council is just hard with a lot of people
[2022-12-31 13:13:45] <%Geoffku> obv
[2022-12-31 13:13:59] <%Taylor131313> go agane xdd531531205982039582309582590382509285580950923509385092590820
[2022-12-31 13:13:59] <%PanicRush> especially when some of them are running into others on purpose
[2022-12-31 13:14:23] <%Taylor131313> I don't think anyone was doing it on purpose yesterday
[2022-12-31 13:14:43] <%PneumaWHU> I had someone on council run right into me
[2022-12-31 13:15:00] <%PneumaWHU> But the worst was on Dathea when someone with the circle moved to me for no reason
[2022-12-31 13:15:40] <%PanicRush> on one of the last pulls i had a mark, was standing still and 2 people were stacked on me instead of running out
[2022-12-31 13:18:45] <%Taylor131313> shit happens when you have a fairly big group unfortunately
[2022-12-31 13:20:52] <%PneumaWHU> I checked the VOD, I actually tried to move away from them and they still ran on top of me
[2022-12-31 13:21:11] <%drzaius30> I accidently one shotted the boss i needed to learn a blue magic spell from FeelsDankMan
[2022-12-31 13:22:39] <%Sne4ky79> @pneumawhu looked laggy has well with such a big group which probably didnt help either?

[2022-12-31 15:19:12] <+Walysie> I think the numbers looked better together with one space at the sides
[2022-12-31 15:19:26] <+Sugarcoatedx> pretty
[2022-12-31 15:19:28] <+Veenuz> drag the rainbow 2 pixels either way, so they dont mirror

[2022-12-31 15:56:59] <%zerdo1234> it probably also has something to do with how fast and your cells regenerate so they loose color faster

[2022-12-31 16:21:10] <%inPosition> people say smooth as a baby's butt but I doubt I'll ever touch a baby's butt unless it's my kid..
[2022-12-31 16:21:12] <%Aegis_2566> Caucasians are generally hairier than Africans or East Asians. It's because of the environment our ancestors adapted to. At least that's what I believe.

[2022-12-31 16:25:59] <%mewantafriend> It's often a natural "protection" thing. If we go around a whole day worrying about our weight for example, it's very easy to comment on others weight because it's simply always on your mind. Doesn't excuse bad behavior though just explaining :)
[2022-12-31 16:26:01] <%Collnaris> most people dont think about it. it's just an observation they make unintentional

[2022-12-31 16:27:06] <%Enoz___> gonna be honest, I am very glad social media was not a thing when I was a young kid/teen.  The most social thing we had was MSN messenger. if I grew up today, I would probably have experienced a lot more issues.
[2022-12-31 16:27:15] <%+Ms7Mido> prolly not even think about the min after you are done LUL its just a convo
[2022-12-31 16:27:16] <%Collnaris> ye, there's a difference between searching it out on people vs just noticing it at glance
[2022-12-31 16:27:20] <%+rsn_uncle_willie> its not a white people problem...darker skinned people know ashing is a problem
[2022-12-31 16:27:27] <Anelit21> Thing is, theres no way to learn about something if you dont make any mistakes.
[2022-12-31 16:27:29] <%Jelmer7> maybe its just relatable?, it's like seeing a little kid going through the same struggle you went through at his age?

[2022-12-31 17:09:50] <%Twigbot4k> While I find DF overall very pretty, one quest in Waking Shores was 300% frustrating.  Going for 5 healing plants.  Mini map marked each, okay cool.  It did not help much to pin down the exact Z axis however.  I spent what felt like 30 mins, going up, down, up, down, up and down, trying to find the exact level the plants where on.  Trees and leaves and branches were in my way constantly.  I had my table flip toy on cooldown chronically.

[2022-12-31 18:35:06] <%Twigbot4k> You play evoker in the middle to heal, or dps, being in the middle, means it takes you very little to hit both groups.  Unless everyone is super social distancing each other.
[2022-12-31 18:35:06] <%+ourdarkstar> you got this annie
[2022-12-31 18:35:24] <%Collnaris> just do your best eShrug
[2022-12-31 18:35:34] <+innerstswe> in classic when this happends u it somehow switched to character specific binds. just switch back and it works.. (ingen aning om d funkar på retail) @AnnieFuchsia
[2022-12-31 18:35:44] <%Turbopumper> imagine sitting 3 hours in queue only to end up with a healer that has no binds xdd

[2022-12-31 18:35:49] <%Twigbot4k> Evoker also has solid movement options, so if in a bad spot, you can fix that.  Fast.  Easily.
[2022-12-31 18:36:02] <%Swiggyswoo_> @Twigbot4k You do realize Evokers only have two actual big heals, right? And they can only hit one of those two groups, which means if people are all over the place you're making them spam living flame which is a waste of time
[2022-12-31 18:36:04] <fogmod> is no one playing rbg's in dragonflight?

[2022-12-31 18:38:11] <%Twigbot4k> If you are healing LFR, or a horrible regular raid group, they will _always_ make your life hell, as any role.  The solution there, is to drop the problem group, get a _better_ raid group.  ;)

[2022-12-31 18:39:05] <%Swiggyswoo_> In raids it doesnt matter because you can only hit 5 people anyways, so spreading out doesnt make a difference since your other healers can cover that @Twigbot4k
[2022-12-31 18:39:42] <%Twigbot4k> I don't live in mythic+, my understanding of mythic+ is people run that _for_ the difficulty.  If it was easy, why bother?  Learn evoker heals, find a way to beat it, that's fun, right?

[2022-12-31 18:41:22] <%Twigbot4k> likewise.  mythic + is supposed to be hard.  It's going to be busy for evoker heals.  It's going to be busy for _any_ healer.  Except that godmode player in the back over there.  They'll sleep through high mythic key clears healing it.

[2022-12-31 18:42:31] <%Swiggyswoo_> I mean yes, it's hard, which is why if you're a ranged not within 10 yards of melee when your healer is an Evoker you're literally griefing the group because you can't get healed @Twigbot4k
[2022-12-31 18:42:33] <%Twigbot4k> precisely how hard, will vary for each healer, somewhat, as each's kit is different, to some extent.  And FOTM specs will have it somewhat easier, per usual.
[2022-12-31 18:42:46] VIEWERS: 1 467
[2022-12-31 18:43:40] <%Twigbot4k> As an ex-evil player, I can say there are 1000s of ways to grief your group, in any content.  If someone doesn't want to be healed, they can safely range the healer, since forever.

[2022-12-31 18:44:39] <%Twigbot4k> it's just easier, at a glance, ranging an evoker healer.  BUT evokers got many movement options.  If they WANT to heal you, you'll need to move FAST and constantly to escape them trying to heal you.

[2022-12-31 20:01:02] <%cascio94> Raccoons are not indigenous to northern Europe, but are considered an invasive species after the four raccoons set free by Herman Göring in 1930’s Germany proliferated into the country’s current figure of over one million animals. The invasive species has now clearly established itself in Denmark too, meaning that Sweden is but a brief swim away.

[2022-12-31 22:52:20] <%Basigouloum> Just wanted to take a minute to wish you all a happy new year and most of all good health! These days people don't spend much time or thought on some personal words to their friends, they just copy and paste some random message and send it on. So after all we've been through this year I want to thank you for your friendship and wish you a happy and fulfilling 2018 - you’re the best gymnastics group anyone could ask for. Best wishes, Helen

I watched his stream for the first time yesterday (always just seen him in clips) and he spent roughly 80-90% of the stream talking about forsen and his viewers. Is that what all his streams are? Does he not do anything else but talk about another streamer all day?
