[2023-01-02 15:29:19] <xxmegapunch> happy new year. a lot of streamers say moira needs a rework and she needs more utility but never say how. how would u rework moira. i think u take away damage orb. increase syphon damage by 10%  increase heal orb and spray by 15%.  replace damage orb w a cooldown that lasts 8 seconds giving all enemies close a 10% damage abd speed boost w a 15 second cooldown. turn her into a heavy heal rush specific support.

[2023-01-02 15:44:18] <%+tm_901> its kinda crazy that a streamer who plays the game as his job is questioning if they'll complete the BP
[2023-01-02 15:44:29] <%AlistairVD> the mode itself doesnt give more xp. its the length of the matches

[2023-01-02 15:44:36] <OhGodItsOz> quickplay is better because you get role bonuses and win bonuses and all that

[2023-01-02 15:44:54] <OrderOfKhaos> Unranked is harder to get a longer match since you only do one round of payload compared to 2 rounds in ranked. So I believe you are right. I play a lot of QP and sometimes I get almost 1k or over 1K on longer games.
[2023-01-02 15:44:55] <%Fust3r_Cluck> it's probably worse because queue times I think

[2023-01-02 16:12:36] <%+YeetLoaf_Gaming> Ram is actually pretty balanced. For a first release, he‚Äôs not as broken as a hero usually would be on release. Surprisingly

[2023-01-02 16:12:55] <ImpossibleGT> I think they took MH out of Arcade so that people who play mostly MH can do all the non-arcade challenges by playing MH
[2023-01-02 16:12:57] <%$gamecat_> flex or supp
[2023-01-02 16:12:59] <Twister_ow> ok ty then i can giv my brother that answer
[2023-01-02 16:12:59] <%+tm_901> does anyone in chat know if can get the ranked title e.g. t500 challenger from the 'combined' role SR?
[2023-01-02 16:13:02] <rifl3man> are we talking 35 wins overall or comp wins?

[2023-01-02 16:13:23] <bullenkullen> You need 35 wins and to use all their abilities in practice range
[2023-01-02 16:13:23] <Strattekun> You also have to do some practice range stuff that isn't too hard
[2023-01-02 16:13:25] <%izzykizzy3> Hi emong and chat! I hope yall had a happy holidays :)

[2023-01-02 16:13:45] <%widowmakre> do you think they'd ever bring back competitive arcade game modes again? like copa lucioball or competitive no limits
[2023-01-02 16:13:45] <poptort122> @emongg sorry for asking, but when does the new patch drop?
[2023-01-02 16:13:46] VIEWERS: 2¬†303
[2023-01-02 16:13:49] <zaraki498> Hello Mr. Emongg, I was watching your Switch video and the reason you weren't getting any Console gamers is because Crossplay between PC and console is off by default for Console
[2023-01-02 16:13:50] <+kellobyte> it'd make sense to lose them
[2023-01-02 16:13:52] <%faultysaeg> @rifl3man Quickplay or Ranked. Just not Arcade
[2023-01-02 16:13:54] <%+tm_901> not open queue, the 'combined' one in role queue career profile, someone told me you can actually get diamond tank/dps/supp and end up with t500 combined
[2023-01-02 16:13:54] <FlaminSky7> You got to use her abilities in the practice range as well

[2023-01-02 16:15:44] <Statiser> @emongg i hope overwatch doesn't fall into the warzone trend of releasing someone overpowered in the battle pass every season and then nerf them after the battle pass is over

[2023-01-02 17:13:45] <TheGreekSpeedster> @BOOOOOOOOOO00M Ashe had the same issue and they nerfed her but go off i guess. Meanwhile sojourn does 195 dmg. Even without a pocket she can melt you

[2023-01-02 17:14:07] <BOOOOOOOOOO00M> @BOOOOOOOOOO00M yup that was dumb. Mercy is the issue, especially for how easy she is to play
[2023-01-02 17:14:11] <%+mkwa_skittles> is it worth it to play Lucio hog on rialoto first point to hard go for the off the map
[2023-01-02 17:14:17] <hitoshura_tdn> many people in lower ranks seems to fall of the bridge in this map
[2023-01-02 17:14:19] <OminousEinherjar> Today I finally pulled down a Pharrah and Mercy and managed to smack them around as Ramattra, was fun, if only it went higher

[2023-01-02 17:15:23] <%$TheNastyFridge> @BOOOOOOOOOO00M Mercy might be easy to pick up, but her movement isn't that easy to master and key to her survivability. Have you ever played Mercy?
[2023-01-02 17:15:24] <%zonar_ow> @BOOOOOOOOOO00M to climb, maybe. i'll give you that because it relies on your dps being able to do something, but to play? very easy.
[2023-01-02 17:15:25] <turtl3_dud3> as a bronze/silver player. its cause were brain dead
[2023-01-02 17:15:30] <ImpossibleGT> @TwoSaucyy I mean it is pointless but you still have to design with it in mind. If you make it possible for players to constantly teleport teammates against their will, possibly off the map, they're definitely going to

[2023-01-02 17:15:55] <TaviaSweatyOF> its not ur teams fault if u cant climb @thegreekspeedster
[2023-01-02 17:16:03] <+snorble> @BOOOOOOOOOO00M wholeheartedly agree, getting the hang of mercy's mobility options can really make or break how effective once can be at the hero

[2023-01-02 17:22:28] <zealpt> It seems like their Orisa is doing a good job of stopping Emongg from doing whatever he wants; everything is contested and they seem well-coordinated, which I guess is a good tactic.

[2023-01-02 17:58:43] <bakush> They should have the top500 icon start as copper colored, and rust and become greener as you wait longer in queue. Thoughts?

[2023-01-02 19:12:06] <DonGeter> I got the dva skin
[2023-01-02 19:12:13] <%aruKasOtakemaru> and sigma/orisa because he can throw them in the air while orisa charges and he drops onto her ult
[2023-01-02 19:12:24] <%iliketoeatpineapples> @sunwardrelic not if they are also getting heal pocket
[2023-01-02 19:12:26] <%Culein_> its 160 cause it makes damage over time too

[2023-01-02 19:14:16] <Nabalazs> the best combo is orisa bastion ults
[2023-01-02 19:14:18] <%0fficer_toaster> Best Combo I've seen with Orisa's is actually Hanzo, Can catch the people running out of your ult

[2023-01-02 20:26:17] <@%^StreamElements> IAmBlinK, Emongg's ult is on numpad4 because he plays with arrow keys. He does not play left handed. The reason the other abilities say E and Shift is because they are double bound.

[2023-01-02 20:43:33] <%Nennai> @sherwin_fernandes you can draw if both teams get the same amount of progress. this can happen at the checkpoints in push, the point and checkpoints on hybrid, and more rarely, the checkpoints on payload
[2023-01-02 20:43:38] <dredlock470> a good first round

[2023-01-02 20:44:49] <zealpt> so tanky
[2023-01-02 20:44:56] <%Nennai> @sherwin_fernandes with the point on hybrid, you progress on the point doesnt save until you get the first 33% (or tick), thus you could full hold a team and then get reverse full held for a draw

[2023-01-02 21:13:29] <+jtkaloust> Maybe because he sent the hook before you were actually gold?

[2023-01-02 21:13:40] <YoYoMP> does it give him full ult charge for the hook or half? So you can tell if it hit regular hp or temp health @Emongg

[2023-01-02 21:14:05] <%Nennai> I think it was frame perfect, so the game rewarded the hook over the gold

[2023-01-02 23:02:15] <+Steph_You_Up> Echo is B but probably second best projectile after Junkrat
[2023-01-02 23:02:16] <n0skun0ss0> Echo is crazy without pocket, her burst damage is isane
[2023-01-02 23:02:17] <vj2573> b
[2023-01-02 23:02:20] <+Cazza17> echo's damage potential is so high, but good healers can negate the beam really easily
[2023-01-02 23:02:20] <kasper93> @schubiez most are not even plat
[2023-01-02 23:02:27] <+CraK_val> Ashe Mercy is better so nerf genji

[2023-01-02 23:02:31] <phantomtrips> echo is not B she just isnt shes A
[2023-01-02 23:02:36] <morfanos> Echo burst dmg is nuts
[2023-01-02 23:02:39] <vibethethird> In low ranks cass may be fun because people fight closely, but in high ranks cass just cant do as much as other dps can, like he cant do enough dmg

[2023-01-02 23:18:50] <+Kaeldrys_> My favorite character is the reaper guy. he is very powerfull. special move, honestly is one of the best in the game and so he comes equipped with these two revolvers and only takes about 3 or 4 shots to actually execute a kill so it comes really in handy specially when you come from the side.

[2023-01-02 23:30:42] <kasper93> moira is dps, thier healing is really hard to manage tank alive, but if you have kiriko who is healbotting, than moira can push much dmg

[2023-01-02 23:33:25] <+Zeneam> yeah A+
[2023-01-02 23:33:31] <1stplays> I'd put her in A
[2023-01-02 23:33:39] <DwDrums123> Absolutely
[2023-01-02 23:33:46] <LordDikusMaximus> is shes niche she cant be S

[2023-01-02 23:33:58] VIEWERS: 9¬†557
[2023-01-02 23:34:01] <freequennt> are we doing tier list for pro play or just general?
[2023-01-02 23:34:01] <@%^StreamElements> If you're noticing ads at unfortunate times, Twitch now requires all streams to run ads at set intervals. We're not triggering them, they're on Twitch's end and out of our control.
[2023-01-02 23:34:02] <naughtyones> Would put her high A tier just because how easly she can be isolated on a dive
[2023-01-02 23:34:06] <kasper93> you can't have ANA, KIRIKO, MERCY, LUCIO all in S...
[2023-01-02 23:34:07] <lateyr> Ana very good
[2023-01-02 23:34:08] <serpentaurus4> if ana is S then widow too
[2023-01-02 23:34:14] <frozenchiken01> ANA IS PHARA COUNTER
[2023-01-02 23:34:15] <Absnerdity> I have way more fun playing as Ana than Kiriko. Kiriko is not fun for me.
[2023-01-02 23:34:21] <DwDrums123> She‚Äôs been there and rented a room
[2023-01-02 23:34:25] <z3phyrow> u have insane carry potential as ana in lower tier
[2023-01-02 23:34:30] <Wave23212> @freequennt Seems like both bc they‚Äôre factoring in how Moira dominates lower ranks
[2023-01-02 23:34:38] <LordDikusMaximus> i got GM support by just playing ana, she has really good carry potential

[2023-01-02 23:38:19] <chambatron> But that's not right now
[2023-01-02 23:38:19] <osteriossi> lucio is A or S
[2023-01-02 23:38:19] <ire121> the things is WHY would you pick brig over ana lucio and mercy
[2023-01-02 23:38:20] <kasper93> so if meta changes, bring is storng... but not now
[2023-01-02 23:38:20] <Vader30> so Brig is B due to what ifs.  got it
[2023-01-02 23:38:20] <KaynTSA> B based on ifs
[2023-01-02 23:38:21] <Irockzz> Flats ranking is D At the moment
[2023-01-02 23:38:22] <%Nennai> @LordDikusMaximus her healing comes from hitting the enemy, so a comp that's grouped up will get heals
[2023-01-02 23:38:23] <+Kelnec> how are you going to place her in B when you say it's not good in this meta
[2023-01-02 23:38:23] <TimAceMC> junker queen is at least D tier

[2023-01-02 23:40:52] <reenoxya> Brig is mist time Not usefull, think d too
[2023-01-02 23:40:52] <+BossyPie> brig is the worst support in this meta
[2023-01-02 23:40:52] <osteriossi> @rhamble average silver warrior
[2023-01-02 23:40:52] <fl1ck_ttv> flats bugging

[2023-01-02 23:40:55] <baldinho_> By this argument Ball is B tier too
[2023-01-02 23:40:58] <%SirTryhard7> She should boost LUL
[2023-01-02 23:40:58] <%cee____cee> "there is technically a better pick".... tier list
[2023-01-02 23:40:59] <kasper93> so you pick technically any other support, but brig is not bad xDDDD
[2023-01-02 23:40:59] <+ohgrodd> relative performance is the definition of tiers
[2023-01-02 23:41:00] <booobomb> tf is flats talking about LUL
[2023-01-02 23:41:00] <%Phrosted_> if there were no other tanks junker queen would be a good pick
[2023-01-02 23:41:00] <GRIMlTO> i wouldnt even pick her over moira LUL
[2023-01-02 23:41:00] <chasecagle> A 3 hour tier list
[2023-01-02 23:41:00] <Curxis> I'd rather get any support than Brig
[2023-01-02 23:41:01] <+twitchexoticiswatching> D Tier
[2023-01-02 23:41:01] <+psyfist> So she's not bad...just the worst
[2023-01-02 23:41:02] <Krylphi> There is no way Brig on same lvl as Moira.
[2023-01-02 23:41:02] <$FizzyZX> If Rein is C then how is Brig B
[2023-01-02 23:41:02] <+Drijeridoo> Zen is the best DPS support
[2023-01-02 23:41:03] <Rhamble> @nennai He did say this was the nuclear take. Haha
[2023-01-02 23:41:05] <+fonttypeaaa> brig isn't being played because there's a whole new tank that can demolish people through shields, she gets deleted whenever ram is in game
[2023-01-02 23:41:05] <NatsuPhD> You‚Äôre ranking in this meta not in a void tho
[2023-01-02 23:41:06] <chambatron> Fair
[2023-01-02 23:41:06] <Ahshton> his argument doesnt make sense
[2023-01-02 23:41:07] <EpitaphCrimson> in a competitive contest, that's very arguable
[2023-01-02 23:41:07] <neezley> d tier
[2023-01-02 23:41:07] <%JanelleyBell42> I love playing brig, but even I would put her in C tier.
[2023-01-02 23:41:08] <chasecagle> D tier
[2023-01-02 23:41:09] <+EVlLURGES> Flats sounds like he doesn't play Brig.  She is too squishy to do her job and feels bad to play
[2023-01-02 23:41:09] <%+slipNstash> paper shield, worst ult in the game. she is objectively not good. flats is high.
[2023-01-02 23:41:09] <wowjojofan> VoteYea
[2023-01-02 23:41:09] <dungeonnn_master> bruh the worst support in game
[2023-01-02 23:41:10] <ire121> BRO IF EVERY SUPPORT OUTSHINES HER THAT MEANS SHES BAD
[2023-01-02 23:41:11] <styre_gt_do_crime> D
[2023-01-02 23:41:12] <pikatopher> just let him put it in B so he will stop talking
[2023-01-02 23:41:12] <Insurge2582> some bad argument
[2023-01-02 23:41:14] <morfanos> Then put ball in b tier?
[2023-01-02 23:41:15] <%Nennai> @Rhamble fair KEKW
[2023-01-02 23:41:17] <%zonar_ow> so is ball B tier because in a future meta he's S tier?
[2023-01-02 23:41:18] <chambatron> Still c at most
[2023-01-02 23:41:19] <kritss_> everything about Brigg is bad dps, heal, abilitys, ult all of those are bad
[2023-01-02 23:41:19] <bonelesschicke> Junker Queen is fire if you have a competent healer
[2023-01-02 23:41:20] <RoZe105> i‚Äôm only here to get the dva skin üò≠üò≠
[2023-01-02 23:41:20] <ire121> THAT LOGIC MAKES NO SENSE
[2023-01-02 23:41:20] <Wave23212> Nah I understand what he‚Äôs saying I‚Äôll move her up to C
[2023-01-02 23:41:23] <iRamtic> @Emongg Be the voice of chat!! Brig at the moment is trash!! no where near B tier. Lots of "ifs" being raised. If other support are above her, she can't be in same tier as Moira....
[2023-01-02 23:41:29] <kacakev> BALL IS B TIER IF BRIG IS B TIER
[2023-01-02 23:41:30] <derzky_huerzky> ok Flats u needs to play brig in plat
[2023-01-02 23:41:30] <thegargoyle7> FLATS ON THAT COOCHANG
[2023-01-02 23:41:30] <aventiumnx> @fonttypeaaa exactly, how can Brig be even remotely playable with Ram
[2023-01-02 23:41:31] <Wave23212> BUT C AT THE MOST
[2023-01-02 23:41:31] <Absnerdity> Balance patches absLOL
[2023-01-02 23:41:33] <%Nennai> hammond has a high skill ceiling, brig does not
[2023-01-02 23:41:35] <Agentj007> C at best, D at worst for me
[2023-01-02 23:41:35] <+DankGreenThumb> does Flats have a crush on someone named Bridgette, that's the only way he would say the things he just said
[2023-01-02 23:41:36] <anjunafanatic> C or D for brig
[2023-01-02 23:41:37] <+ikoalabearz> A b- tier would be chefs kiss üíã
[2023-01-02 23:41:38] <kasper93> so she is not bad, but you don't play her.... because... she is worse, best take I heard ;p

[2023-01-02 23:41:46] <uWok> lucio does her job better but shes not as bad as ppl think

[2023-01-02 23:46:21] <hyrulemelon> @iRamtic ong
[2023-01-02 23:46:21] <kasper93> Ok, flats have really biased tier list towards S tier, because he plays rein mostly, and most heroes are better than rein and this is what we see here.
[2023-01-02 23:46:25] <aventiumnx> So all supports are strong....but they aren't at the same time? lol

[2023-01-02 23:46:33] <fl1ck_ttv> Mercy S tier here is correct
[2023-01-02 23:46:35] <%SirTryhard7> If you have strong players who can hold their own it works
[2023-01-02 23:46:35] <+BossyPie> why is it current meta for mercy but not brig

[2023-01-02 23:46:39] <n0skun0ss0> Having a goated mercy as support is the best
[2023-01-02 23:46:40] <drewiez10> the game is in such a better state when mercy is bad
[2023-01-02 23:46:41] <ChipJiggins> Mercy is so fucking hard to kill
[2023-01-02 23:46:45] <turtl3_dud3> MEOW
[2023-01-02 23:46:45] <%JackMStiofain> @kasper93 Man, I haven't seen him play Rein in a LONG time.
[2023-01-02 23:46:46] <+Tetra_graph> i want brawl meta back, im so bored of all the snipers
[2023-01-02 23:46:46] <+EVlLURGES> Pressing E should not cancel an entire pick in 5v5
[2023-01-02 23:46:47] <Chubbuwu> BRO LUCIO IS S TIER
[2023-01-02 23:46:49] <+Drijeridoo> So is Flatts generally arguing for some of these heroes that there are multiple alternative metas that could exist right now and just aren't necessarily being used? Otherwise it seems like the rankings should be toward the currently viable meta...
[2023-01-02 23:46:50] <SuikaOW2> shouldnt be allowed to rez 4v5 unless in valk. should be 2 deaths to rez
[2023-01-02 23:46:51] <Chubbuwu> MERCY IS F TIER
[2023-01-02 23:46:53] <%simply_patti> Guys dmg boosting & pocketing a JQ is awesome as Mercy because it increases her queen‚Äôs heal a bit and she can go ham! Lol I like pocketing JQs emongWiggle

[2023-01-02 23:51:27] <Xelcar> I think you are not respecting what "S Teir" should mean. You are putting heroes that are high A tier into S tier because they CAN be good. S tier should be reserved for heroes that are ALWAYS good.
[2023-01-02 23:51:31] <Ahshton> flats has so many L takes

[2023-01-02 23:51:48] <%samepuddle> S tier just lists the current meta
[2023-01-02 23:51:49] <kasper93> @heyitsDevriss no, we are not... tier list ultimately doesn't make sense if you gone into synergy details and what works. But it is good content for tick tok, so everyone is doing it
[2023-01-02 23:51:49] <%zonar_ow> well if brig is B, zen has to be A

[2023-01-02 23:52:24] <1stplays> I'm not that upset if Zen's discord orb is strong because already requires coordination to capitalize

[2023-01-02 23:52:37] <+WolfieSau> mecry dmg boost is boost againt the entire enemy team. zen dmg boost is against only one enemy
[2023-01-02 23:52:41] <n0skun0ss0> support weak copium
[2023-01-02 23:52:42] <%Phrosted_> give zen some kinda of mobility/escap and slightly nerf discord

[2023-01-02 23:52:46] <+SupportRipper> discord orb is broken vs dmg boost cause dmg boost is mostly for 1 dude orb is the whole team that deal more dmg to you
[2023-01-02 23:52:47] <Chubbuwu> UR RANKING IS TERRIBLE
[2023-01-02 23:52:51] <Wave23212> @zonar_ow But at the same time, Zen and Moira can‚Äôt be Lucio level. I think the solution is to move Brig to high C and Emongg agreed she should be D/C
[2023-01-02 23:52:53] <Chubbuwu> U PUT EVERYTHING IN THE WRONG PLACE

[2023-01-02 23:53:07] <+eightbitbella> mercy has no way to defend herself so if you take away her mobility shes useless.
[2023-01-02 23:53:07] <Ahshton> flats trying to justify shit heros being good by saying they have potentional is not a tier list
[2023-01-02 23:53:09] <+O_T_K> @wolfiesau but mercy has to actively apply it..Zen does not

[2023-01-02 23:53:10] <+ElbeeGaming> @daemonologyy I mean I joined thinking it was just Emongg since the title didnt mention Flats
[2023-01-02 23:53:14] <McRachiDOW> @ikoalabearz you can actually aim with ash like widow sort of, but more hitscan
[2023-01-02 23:53:14] <Triage3> I think Zen should be able to kick walls/the ground to push himself like he can kick other characters

[2023-01-02 23:53:22] <ChipJiggins> With how powerful tanks are, Discord Orb making tanks fall over is the only reason to ever pull Zen right now.
[2023-01-02 23:53:23] <%+PatQc> @Chubbuwu says a silver player.
[2023-01-02 23:53:25] <1stplays> That's true. I think tanks should be immune to CC and debuffs.
[2023-01-02 23:53:25] <+Drijeridoo> yes, take away non-tank makes the tank easier to kill. otherwise you just feeding a dmg sponge
[2023-01-02 23:53:27] <uWok> pls dont do anything to zen i want him to keep getting slept on

[2023-01-02 23:54:31] <goat_lives_matter> if it only takes 1 pick to completely counter a hero does it belong in S though?
[2023-01-02 23:54:34] <DrakDragon_05> I feel like hog is 100% S tier because lower rated players don't always know how to counter him with Orisa

[2023-01-02 23:55:24] <Xelcar> I think S tier should be heroes that are strong regardless of what the other team runs.
[2023-01-02 23:55:34] <%+PatQc> @Chubbuwu 5 hours and saying this ranking is terrible, smh u are just dumb.
[2023-01-02 23:55:34] <Wave23212> The default tank is Zarya
[2023-01-02 23:55:35] <Xelcar> A tier should be heroes that are strong but may have a counter

[2023-01-02 23:56:16] <Xelcar> Even to elaboroate, S tier are heroes that are good regardless of what your team or the enemy team runs
[2023-01-02 23:56:20] <%$kittykat_______> @supertf when are we seeing your tier list mister
[2023-01-02 23:56:21] <+forestlights> as a zen main I am excited
[2023-01-02 23:56:26] <n0skun0ss0> A tier
[2023-01-02 23:56:32] <+Steph_You_Up> I miss 225 HP Zen lol. Itll never happen again but it was so fun to be basically unkillable
[2023-01-02 23:56:35] <reubenat0r> what is my girl sombra doing in F tier :(
[2023-01-02 23:56:36] <+mikayladotexe> B or C for sure
[2023-01-02 23:56:37] <+ConcLaveTime> B tier but higher on certain maps
[2023-01-02 23:56:39] <brendasplash> Zen b tier tbh
[2023-01-02 23:56:42] <%SirTryhard7> :(
[2023-01-02 23:56:45] <+Hawk_I_Gaming> i think in a top 500 game if someone chooses
[2023-01-02 23:56:46] <+ConcLaveTime> Still good on circuit
[2023-01-02 23:56:49] <+fonttypeaaa> I get zens who don't even use healing orb
[2023-01-02 23:56:52] <+billlewe23> Yes but the fact brig is in b tier just negates everything said
[2023-01-02 23:56:53] <Xelcar> @Xelcar exactly, putting heroes that require other picks from your team in S tier is asinine
[2023-01-02 23:56:54] <vj2573> better than brig
[2023-01-02 23:56:54] <perfectpromises> bro junker queen isn‚Äôt even that bad
[2023-01-02 23:56:55] <+BossyPie> zen is so much better then brig
[2023-01-02 23:56:56] <%Phrosted_> zen is soooooo much better than brig
[2023-01-02 23:57:02] <%simply_patti> I can‚Äôt wait for the patch and us JQ lovers will be recognized lol
[2023-01-02 23:57:03] <chasecagle> He‚Äôs contemplating putting zen under brig lol
[2023-01-02 23:57:05] <%SirTryhard7> SeemsGood
[2023-01-02 23:57:05] <hawks_sa> Zen >>> brig
[2023-01-02 23:57:06] <lateyr> Zen is so much better than brig
[2023-01-02 23:57:11] <serpentaurus4> as a zen main with 4000 hours, he is A
[2023-01-02 23:57:12] <youngplayyer> Brig and zen can‚Äôt be on the same tier bro
[2023-01-02 23:57:12] <LordDikusMaximus> moira is better than brig to
[2023-01-02 23:57:14] <picklev4> Zen is necessary evil vs hog and Orisa.
[2023-01-02 23:57:17] <+Hawk_I_Gaming> i think in a top 500 game if a player chooses Zen its an automatic throw.
[2023-01-02 23:57:20] <reenoxya> Brig is no B. more D or F.
[2023-01-02 23:57:20] <uWok> WHAT ABOUT ECHO NEXT TO PHARAH??
[2023-01-02 23:57:20] <xTookie_> idk why brig is where she is at KEKW
[2023-01-02 23:57:25] <Wave23212> I will die on the hill that Brig should be C tier
[2023-01-02 23:57:25] <kritss_> Zen in B is fine
[2023-01-02 23:57:25] <%+Eragon_Cola> Zen‚Äôs biggest downfall is his   Zero mobility seagT
[2023-01-02 23:57:25] <cosimoinexile> brig is C not B
[2023-01-02 23:57:27] <%oneir1c> Zen >>>>>> brig all day
[2023-01-02 23:57:27] <+Drijeridoo> Zen A
[2023-01-02 23:57:28] <Chubbuwu> L
[2023-01-02 23:57:29] <MakeEmMone> Zen Is easier to play than brig, Not necessarily a better character.

[2023-01-02 23:57:36] <fl1ck_ttv> I think zen is better than moira and Brig
[2023-01-02 23:57:38] <+Steph_You_Up> Maybe Brig/Zen when ball gets overly buffed and becomes OP lol
[2023-01-02 23:57:45] <+Tangy_Taco> Brig is F and Zen is A tier do it the right way bud
[2023-01-02 23:57:45] <%SirTryhard7> D and f is accurate
[2023-01-02 23:57:46] <chasecagle> If zen is b then brig is d

[2023-01-02 23:57:53] <ArcaneLight> omg Flats
[2023-01-02 23:57:54] <BananaEh30> @chubbuwu If you have too much of a life to put your head in the game then none of your takes exist. That‚Äôs simple. These guys have a job playing the game so they know more than us. Simple.
[2023-01-02 23:57:55] <MakeEmMone> Zen just meshes well with Ram and Melts Orisa.
[2023-01-02 23:57:56] <n0skun0ss0> based
[2023-01-02 23:57:57] <+WolfieSau> why buff supports they all fall abouve b tier
[2023-01-02 23:57:57] <Krylphi> It's Brig should be C
[2023-01-02 23:57:58] <%Culein_> yes
[2023-01-02 23:58:01] <iRamtic> THANKS @Emongg !!! Brig is C or D.
[2023-01-02 23:58:02] <$dodgydaniel> imo ramattra should go next to zen because they look the exact same besides from ramattra's recent growth spurt

[2023-01-02 23:58:05] <%DireDaniel> brig is not B imo
[2023-01-02 23:58:05] <ChipJiggins> Supports are in a fantastic place, and are hugely impactful to the game.

[2023-01-02 23:58:36] <+Drijeridoo> if you bring dmg down, tanks are even more of a godzilla, they'd be unkillable
[2023-01-02 23:58:37] <%simply_patti> Moira is the best dps
[2023-01-02 23:58:38] <+wildrness> aint no way he said dps needs to be nerfed
[2023-01-02 23:58:39] <$dodgydaniel> @hawks_sa agreed, he needs a toilet
[2023-01-02 23:58:40] <fl1ck_ttv> Id put Zen in A tier
[2023-01-02 23:58:41] <ChipJiggins> People that think Supports don't have a big enough impact on the game are insane.

[2023-01-02 23:58:51] <!%xx_m3m3_m4chine_420_69_xx> @AwCrap now that's the tier list i live for
[2023-01-02 23:58:51] <%qeshmer> idk about this... tank is way more impactful than dps. dps is still a relatively low impact role

[2023-01-02 23:58:59] <drewiez10> just nerf tanks
[2023-01-02 23:58:59] <derzky_huerzky> Zen is B+

[2023-01-02 23:59:04] <trollkidtrolls> Good fucking list
[2023-01-02 23:59:06] <gogglesow> Give zen 1000 damage
[2023-01-02 23:59:08] <omgstepbrowhatareyoudoing> you dont need more healing

[2023-01-02 23:59:11] <1stplays> Ana and Brig I guess
[2023-01-02 23:59:15] <morfanos> The entire game revolves around one shots and burst damage. What would a dps nerf even look like?
[2023-01-02 23:59:15] <+Steph_You_Up> @assortedguts07 Gold players or QP warriors always have a superiority complex
[2023-01-02 23:59:16] <%SirTryhard7> Brig needs to be lower emongSad

[2023-01-02 23:59:23] <pietrocanestrarii> @assortedguts07 W sentence
[2023-01-02 23:59:23] <LordDikusMaximus> @kasper93 hes talking about supports... if youve played agaisnt a top 500 squad you would understand
[2023-01-02 23:59:24] <+BossyPie> can't believe I've been baited by flats into watching over an hour for this tier list LUL
[2023-01-02 23:59:24] <belunhinged> i think support will also feel better to play when we have more than like 8 lol
[2023-01-02 23:59:25] <profsorfluf> why are oppinions on other peoples oppinions being removed?
[2023-01-02 23:59:26] <nilster7> baptiste is B
[2023-01-02 23:59:27] <MakeEmMone> @kasper93 Im gold so average player and I use Brig Ult Purely Offensive and It leads to winning the team Fight often as long as my movement is right
[2023-01-02 23:59:28] <k0lmioleipa_> i feel like zen reeaally depends on the map too.. if he can get good positioning and run away easily if seen he can get really good value. also having good tanks is really important while playing zen if you get dived TPFufun
[2023-01-02 23:59:29] <KilluaGoCrazyy> Did zarya get nerfed??? Why D tier???
[2023-01-02 23:59:32] <srinu150> tank more strong, support more strong, and DPS needs nerf NODDERS

[2023-01-02 23:59:33] <fl1ck_ttv> good list.. i thing brig is not B

[2023-01-02 23:59:35] <$dodgydaniel> @drewiez10 they should buff mauga and Tom Beansons (the coffee shop in new queen street)

[2023-01-02 23:59:55] <MakeEmMone> Brig oddly enough plays well with Doom.
[2023-01-02 23:59:57] <drewiez10> @drewiez10 facts
[2023-01-02 23:59:59] <+Nessuno_00> give supports movement speed passive that triggers from healing
