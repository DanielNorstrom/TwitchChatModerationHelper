[2023-01-04 02:39:00] <%opheimer> you will be bad in the beginning
[2023-01-04 02:39:28] <%opheimer> on console you have 60% help with aiming, on pcif you play controller its only 40%
[2023-01-04 02:39:46] <%opheimer> if your pc is good, the game will be so much smoother
[2023-01-04 02:39:50] VIEWERS: 206
[2023-01-04 02:40:27] <%opheimer> if you play with mouse+keyboard, you can do more cool shit in the game but you have to aim all yourself

[2023-01-04 19:08:40] <c1actve> Here’s an idea that I wish someone would voice out, what if mirage’s tactical got reworked into glimpse’s special from rogue company? Since he goes invisible when rezing, he should be able to go invise in general, that way he’ll have a better chance with keeping up with the other skirmishers. He would be like wraith, instead of being invulnerable to damage like wraith, he can take damage but stay invisible. Thoughts?

[2023-01-04 20:49:13] <C2M_Sec> Arenas is not realistic. Most maps dont really have a building, Its mostly open field with Platforms that imitate buildings.
[2023-01-04 20:49:23] <%pray4jeremy> Ranked arenas great for gun practice and its also basically 1v3 practice if you solo queue

[2023-01-04 22:08:45] <%+punishedpark> Daltoosh leaving apex is not good for the game tbh. Mercs also leaving for warzone. Respawn needs to make game fun again or it’s toast

[2023-01-04 22:12:34] <+Enchie> @RealSooperSand I don't think he really cares about viewers anymore, he stays above 50k subs regardless

[2023-01-04 23:06:26] <YangENMY> why use a volt when you can go craft the best smg in the game
[2023-01-04 23:06:42] <the420chef> As long as theres no serious weapon buffs/nerfs in order to change the meta, the car will def be crafted by multiple people every game
[2023-01-04 23:06:50] <bart_taylor> I would agree with you ordinarliy @adamthemuffin  - but the ammo issue (especially in comp) makes it worth it.
