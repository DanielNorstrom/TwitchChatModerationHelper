[2022-12-30 03:20:50] <%bobopedic33> I think it mostly just means one dimensional
[2022-12-30 03:20:52] <%EveryGoshDarnNameIsTaken> @Galinuva25 Not exactly. More like a character that is good at everything, and even the flaws are somehow twisted into something that ultimately is a good trait about them

[2022-12-30 16:00:19] <%sporkboots> quality is types, level is strength

[2022-12-30 16:00:23] <%Chibithulux> Levels make the skeletons hae more hp/dmg
[2022-12-30 16:00:25] <%+dcboizero> level = stronger skellies, Quality = what is summoned
[2022-12-30 16:00:26] <%$Ultrauberness> the shield skele look cool
[2022-12-30 16:00:27] <Runic_Rain> Quality unlocks skele classes basically (guards,etc)
[2022-12-30 16:00:29] <+DyinOften> quality is maybe type, and level is power and health?
[2022-12-30 16:00:31] <%Kodakan> quality raises the chance of special summons like the tank and stuff.. level makes them overall stronger
[2022-12-30 16:00:35] <%MightyCreak> I guess skel level is linked yo the rnrmy level (on the top-right) ?
[2022-12-30 16:00:36] <%toxicpycnometer> @Prescience6631 level is basic numbers for skellies, hp, dmg etc. Quality is chance to spawn advanced skellies
[2022-12-30 16:00:41] <%+henzdn> quality is related to skelly type and lvl is related to their stats
[2022-12-30 16:00:44] <%flipvanmorritz> oh so quality is like base, starting model?

[2022-12-30 16:44:09] <%toxicpycnometer> tank skelly has taunt, so really worth having the quality to get them
[2022-12-30 16:44:14] <%$unknownohyeah> mitigated by summon quality

[2022-12-30 17:11:09] <%+Misssster_Anderson> I would say 10 is a good number
[2022-12-30 17:11:10] <+Schan> probably 5ish but mostly this stream
[2022-12-30 17:11:10] <%HugBringer> I only haev about 5-6
[2022-12-30 17:11:10] <%+CoMoVirinae> maybe-ish, but i float around a lot.
[2022-12-30 17:11:10] <%othernathan> I always watch Twitch but heavily favor a few streamers
[2022-12-30 17:11:10] <%+BantyRooster590> Barb and then whatever is on when Barb isn‚Äôt.

[2022-12-30 17:11:15] <%Overlord3456> hmm, I basically only watch Barb, but I think I would watch other people if you got hit by a bus or something barbShrug
[2022-12-30 17:11:15] <%O_Luke> I would watch less twitch, but you and Oats are the two main streamers I watch.
[2022-12-30 17:11:15] <%$Septomor> I follow like 20
[2022-12-30 17:11:16] <%$k1ng_dragon> i watch Barb and a small Resident Evil speedrunner
[2022-12-30 17:11:17] <%+fromage_fiend> easily more than 10 for me i like a lot of things
[2022-12-30 17:11:17] <%CypherDusk> I mostly watch you though LUL
[2022-12-30 17:11:18] <%+BeyondJon> consistently watch 3 streamers and poke around here and there with 2-3 more streamers
[2022-12-30 17:11:18] <%Cristophlyz> i have like 10~ followed, and i jump around a lot, but like 2~4 are 70% of my time
[2022-12-30 17:11:18] <%$Bloody_Raw> 1
[2022-12-30 17:11:18] <%$Mrfrodough> there's a handful, you are the primary
[2022-12-30 17:11:19] <%Perico__Jones> 1-40
[2022-12-30 17:11:19] <%+desktp> what really brought me to twitch was esports, stayed for other streamers after that
[2022-12-30 17:11:20] <GreyWolfmage> indeed
[2022-12-30 17:11:20] <%$snoops_kush> for sure
[2022-12-30 17:11:20] <%+SeeDoubleU> Not me, i mod on 1 and is a regular on 3-4 others
[2022-12-30 17:11:20] <%scott85> on regular basis I watch 5 or 6 streamers a day (I watch about 16 hours a day)
[2022-12-30 17:11:21] <%anvaz> yeah. 10 and a couple of satellites for me
[2022-12-30 17:11:21] <%+dcboizero> but really comes down to 2-3
[2022-12-30 17:11:21] <Vanstrummer33> I watch marathons a lot
[2022-12-30 17:11:21] <%+hoody208> only really have time for 1
[2022-12-30 17:11:21] <%abs1830> got main streamers then backup streamers
[2022-12-30 17:11:21] <%lamda00> mostly streamers I'm subscribed too
[2022-12-30 17:11:22] <%soyy_sauced> there are so many good streamers to watch
[2022-12-30 17:11:22] <%+Denied316> I start work at 630am I'm lost until 810
[2022-12-30 17:11:22] <%Jake0502> Depends on what games I am playing atm.
[2022-12-30 17:11:22] <nudeninja007> 2 or less!
[2022-12-30 17:11:23] <%DcRising> I use Twitch as background noise a lot while working
[2022-12-30 17:11:24] <%+Sorry4HavingFun> i only watch 3
[2022-12-30 17:11:24] <%$kae_oss> You and zfg sometimes laser
[2022-12-30 17:11:24] <+jasonyeahhhhh> It is very game dependent
[2022-12-30 17:11:25] <%+kaonnonn> I have more streame4s but I'm game dependant too
[2022-12-30 17:11:25] <%+JHammon67> You, Aura, Poo, Shoujo, Haelian are 95% of my watching.
[2022-12-30 17:11:25] <%+morse314> i watch you and sm0ke. the rest is for educational purposes
[2022-12-30 17:11:25] <%Almar_AZL9S> @overlord3456 LUL
[2022-12-30 17:11:26] <%+7inchesOfSatanicPanik> only cause I rarely catch juzz live and just watch his stuff on YouTube haha
[2022-12-30 17:11:26] <%rgstupot> you line up with my work schedule, it's a mutually beneficial relationship
[2022-12-30 17:11:26] <%$Ultrauberness> i think i have about 5 solid ones, but i watch random ones late at night
[2022-12-30 17:11:26] <%+BarbViewer> Nobody else has the substance that this stream has.
[2022-12-30 17:11:26] <@%xmariedetx> I only watch you and oats recently tbh
[2022-12-30 17:11:27] <Disorder_unit> i follow hundreds but i watch about 10
[2022-12-30 17:11:27] <%pandahugs77> That‚Äôs us. Two or three streamers.
[2022-12-30 17:11:28] <%FrenchFryApocalypse> zfgRunOgre ?
[2022-12-30 17:11:28] <%$1up_ryan> It‚Äôs like a tv show, I‚Äôll switch around who I watch but most of my time is concentrated in that streamer
[2022-12-30 17:11:28] <%joshuahatcher> barb, poo, and once in a blue moon either simply or cheese (although their chats tend to be unpleasant and immature)
[2022-12-30 17:11:29] <%ciderking> I watch you & moon
[2022-12-30 17:11:29] <%+idle_android> That‚Äôs definitely how it started for me.  I watch more, but it‚Äôs specific streamers based on time of day
[2022-12-30 17:11:30] <%$gumnas> Barb, Poo and Aura. That‚Äôs it.
[2022-12-30 17:11:30] <%+k_billiam> I think I follow about 100
[2022-12-30 17:11:30] <%+QuirkieTurkie> i'd say 90% of what I watch are 2 streamers though
[2022-12-30 17:11:30] <%$qzcx> barb, oats, zeni, laser,  then a bunch of smaller streams
[2022-12-30 17:11:31] <%+LegendaryTetenal> your follow list is different.  It's business and friends
[2022-12-30 17:11:31] <%$The_JuggerNerd> Id also like to know how many of us actually just SEARCH TWITCH to find someone new
[2022-12-30 17:11:31] <%$reservoir_dawgs> who was your most watched streamer of 2022 barb?
[2022-12-30 17:11:32] <%CypherDusk> I like to keep the number of streams I follow kinda low
[2022-12-30 17:11:32] <%betooth> There's a ton I watch, but there's the cozy 3-4 I always use as my defaults while working
[2022-12-30 17:11:32] <%+WhiskeyWood> 3 I would watch no mater the game everyone else it depends.
