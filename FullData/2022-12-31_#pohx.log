You vaal the scepter in the hopes it turns rare. You get other 4 rare bases of the same scepter by casually playing the game. Vendor them with the one you corrupted into a rare. Then you get a rare ilvl 4 Rare clean scepter. How to craft. On average you need 16 scorch fossils to get +1 fire and fire dot multi. - Oct0_Pus

[2022-12-31 17:25:27] <@%lemoncoolers> @wickedone19752 I wouldn't recommend it. You can use horizons to get your favorite maps. Horizons respect your favorites so they are weighted to pick them
[2022-12-31 17:25:35] <@%GoGoLoThirty> oh true its nye, happy new years tonight chat pohxLove
[2022-12-31 17:25:35] <+PichetGoulu> Jug lvl98, trying to swap my RF into helmet, why does so many poe.ninja builds use empower+awakened AoE instead of lifetap/awakened swift afflic ?
[2022-12-31 17:25:47] <@%lemoncoolers> assuming they're natural maps ofc
[2022-12-31 17:25:51] <%SolidLogik> yeah I just got into T7 maps and still kind of squishy since I'm upgrading gear as I go. I might go back to the campaign acts and farm them there but I need levels also

[2022-12-31 17:29:34] <%Zerograviti> @lemoncoolers I'll try to swap to Underground Sea, I hate the fact that the connected map to toxic sewer is overgrown ruin, that map is so fucking shit I hate fighting Maligaro
[2022-12-31 17:29:42] <mcdoman> sorry to ask but when you was using asenath gentle touch, your mtx explode was on herald of ash right?
[2022-12-31 17:29:56] <@%GoGoLoThirty> @SolidLogik dude i hear you haha, i dropped a +1 with fire multi at lvl 15, took me 2-3 divines to upgrade :P and that was early, when sceptres were much cheaper to craft
[2022-12-31 17:29:56] <@%lemoncoolers> I use all my horizons to turn my T16s into toxic sewers

[2022-12-31 17:34:30] <%+Thaeyn> RF doesn't ignite correct?
[2022-12-31 17:34:33] <%SolidLogik> @SolidLogik yeah I've noticed that. Just sucks with only like 14% fire damage, and 22% ele damage.
[2022-12-31 17:34:35] <@%GoGoLoThirty> @Thaeyn correct
[2022-12-31 17:35:14] <@%GoGoLoThirty> @SolidLogik yeah youll upgrade it soon enough. you can consider the +1 to be roughly somewhere between like 23 and 27% fire dot multi, that should help figure out other possibilities
[2022-12-31 17:35:27] <%+Thaeyn> Yeah thinking about it would be bonkers if it did Ignite I guess

[2022-12-31 17:36:09] <reventor1337> Do you feel sanctum works well on your rf? at t16's I feel more safe switching hextouch for unbound ailments for more slow on frostblink, and selfcursing flam. But that does require unreserved mana

[2022-12-31 17:36:21] <@%lemoncoolers> I'm in the mood to play a build that gets juicy herald of ice shatters but can't think of anything that scales aoe besides BV
[2022-12-31 17:36:21] <@%GoGoLoThirty> @Thaeyn depends i guess. ignites dont stack naturally. so it would be pretty small, just consistent. but in any case yeah, RF never "hits" so it cant ignite.
[2022-12-31 17:36:27] <@%donavanshepard> RF isnt a great sanctum build. youre just a glorified fire trapper really
[2022-12-31 17:36:34] <@%GoGoLoThirty> @lemoncoolers ice nova is the WAAAAVE

[2022-12-31 17:52:19] <+LightcallerTV> wave 30 is doable for sure ... it can be a bit dicey and slow. 1/10 took me way too long just to complete the challenge lol

[2022-12-31 17:52:35] <+zmonsta37> what MTX is your portal called?
[2022-12-31 17:52:50] <+timeflow02> @GoGoLoThirty rn i m running blight+ strongbox on exarch with neversink filter

[2022-12-31 17:53:00] <%Zerograviti> @ShinnyChicken I just go to tft if I have a very specific thing that is 100% easier to sell/buy there
[2022-12-31 17:53:19] <%Melledor> Hi Pohx, do you know a way to farm horror essence in ssf ? beside taking the nodes in the atlas tree
[2022-12-31 17:53:32] <Oct0_Pus> i only use tft to buy aislings hilocks vorici and to sell heist stuff
[2022-12-31 17:53:41] <@%GoGoLoThirty> @timeflow02 not doing blight maps? i dont think blight scarabs/atlas is really the way to go for blight tbh. the blight atlas is somewhat underwhelming this league. blighted/ravaged maps however, print divines
[2022-12-31 17:54:23] <%+SpidercowSD> @Pohx I never checked that guy didnt know he sold Gems! Awesome and thanks!
[2022-12-31 17:54:23] <+timeflow02> @GoGoLoThirty yep i m doing blighted maps :>
[2022-12-31 17:54:26] VIEWERS: 392
[2022-12-31 17:54:33] <@%ShinnyChicken> You can straight up use their website to price a whole tab (fragments, essence etc), it takes like 30 seconds - highly recommend if you don't want to sell everything individually ok @Zerograviti
[2022-12-31 17:54:33] <@%GoGoLoThirty> you dont need 80% of the blight atlas for blighted/ravaged maps, because they dont count as "maps", similar to how logbooks dont work like that either
[2022-12-31 17:54:34] <+Narvisia> I just corrupt any essence mob I see with like 4+ on it and pray no horrors yet so I know I'm being dumb but I'll get some eventually
[2022-12-31 17:54:43] <%Melledor> ohhh, You can reroll ? :O The only way that I've got some is by using remnant
[2022-12-31 17:54:51] <+LightcallerTV> @Melledor its not just the nodes you also need to carry a stack of the corrupting essence and hit the essences that are high enough tier with the corruption so they have a chance to turn into the the 4 giga essences
[2022-12-31 17:55:31] <@%GoGoLoThirty> horrors would be like 60c if not for rerolls lul

[2022-12-31 17:57:17] <dexhunterz> is it worth using the remnant passives when you run out? or is there a better way to get them?
[2022-12-31 17:57:23] <%Melledor> didnt even think of that, thank you alot :D
[2022-12-31 17:57:34] <@%GoGoLoThirty> @Ctsboss whats your trap tooltip with RF on and lifetap up inside your hideout?

[2022-12-31 17:59:28] <%Melledor> try both, but maxx res is really good
[2022-12-31 17:59:30] <%SolidLogik> the fire damage with ignite chance is a veiled mod correct?

[2022-12-31 18:09:04] <+Purecrew> If you are doing 700k plus damage with RF I dont think infernal cry is really needed tbg
[2022-12-31 18:09:07] <+Purecrew> tbh*
[2022-12-31 18:09:08] <+Narvisia> ctsboss what is your issue again?  your pob is saying FT does a 135 hit but the burning ground dps is nearly 500kl
[2022-12-31 18:09:25] <+roughbloke> anyone know whats the reason FT DPS is lower in tooltip but higher in POB than RF for me?
[2022-12-31 18:09:38] <+Narvisia> you're after the burning ground dps not hit
[2022-12-31 18:10:10] <%Zerograviti> @Purecrew if you're doing a completely stacked up screen of Expedition mobs, believe me, Infernal Cry is needed (although Call to Arms is not)

[2022-12-31 18:12:11] <+LightcallerTV> For sure infernal cry has 100% fallen off for me in need. I mean my RF nearly at 1m tooltip but sometimes i like to press cry in thick delirium shrine packs and the like. its just personal preference not the end of the world that I am "wasting" two points
[2022-12-31 18:12:17] <%+Cortegos> @Pohx is there a more deterministic way to get a saffells frame?  or just gwennen and random drops?
[2022-12-31 18:12:24] <@%GoGoLoThirty> @Ctsboss you have a couple minor mistakes on your tree sec
[2022-12-31 18:12:25] <+Purecrew> I do 2.4m dps with RF so my perception of infernal cry requirement is a little skewed

[2022-12-31 18:13:12] <%l_carpetron> @Ctsboss crafting a +1 sceptre with just 3 craft mods, fire damage over time multi and fire damage / chance to ignite will be better and can either exalt slam or use a hunters exalt to try and get a nice modifier on it.   Tree: Use the top of the elemental mastery for ailment eff instead of chance to ignite  Also use retribution instead of the Aoe circle  - will give you a skill point for fire mastery at top of tree

[2022-12-31 18:15:28] <%l_carpetron> +1 fire spell skill gems - use 40% qual worth of fire gems, and a normal sceptre

[2022-12-31 18:15:38] <%l_carpetron> sell to vendor
[2022-12-31 18:15:57] <%Vizindasogra> let's assume you have all items, how would you put a cluster jewel in your tree
[2022-12-31 18:16:10] <%l_carpetron> Oh and make sure its a sceptrewith 40 ele damage implicit like void
[2022-12-31 18:16:22] <+Ctsboss> ok so moved those 2 points to the Fire Damage OT wheel at the top
[2022-12-31 18:16:22] <@%GoGoLoThirty> @Ctsboss you would benefit greatly from a +1 amulet. you should adjust your tree to pick up the following: retribution (youre missing 30% dmg there), prismatic skin (your amulet is 0 dmg, its a big dmg slot for casters) your gloves should be fire multi implicit, not unnerve, you need to swap the chance to ignite over to ailment effect beside divine judgement. also the fire cluster above witch is a huge portion of dmg so try and restructure to get that before judging your dps too harshly

[2022-12-31 18:19:49] <+Purecrew> @Ctsboss Also recommend replacing that level 19 lifetap in your shield charge with a level 1, You want lifetap to be up 100% of the time running through maps
[2022-12-31 18:20:07] <Copium_TV> @Pohx is RF considered elemental damage? can the Original Sin ring have any benefit?
[2022-12-31 18:20:11] <@%GoGoLoThirty> @Narvisia once you get charisma you dont even need the jewel to run vitarrogance, determination, malev, tempest shield, skitterbots

[2022-12-31 18:54:40] <%+shakabrehh> sad to see Kay is done with PoE & guides. her minion guides helped me pick the game up.

[2022-12-31 18:55:22] <%+shakabrehh> she released a video this morning saying bye. she said she just doesnt really play much anymore and poe is going in a different direction with minions i think
[2022-12-31 18:55:38] <@%GoGoLoThirty> yeah this is a fucking Despairge minions league
[2022-12-31 18:55:43] <ExiledOzzy> the gam3report does nothing but minions.. but he doesnt hold ur hand on how he sets things up..

[2022-12-31 18:56:14] <%+shakabrehh> i think she also just doesn't do much poeing anymore more than anything
[2022-12-31 18:56:19] <@%GoGoLoThirty> yeah i guess thats true, personally i do feel like minion builds got kinda cucked this league but
[2022-12-31 18:56:22] <Stoptripp> why u need some one holding ur hands
[2022-12-31 18:56:34] <%+LightcallerTV> Does anyone know if there is a reliable way to craft conc and burn with more ele on helm? I am assuming you are hitting the More Ele and Burn then suffix cannot changing over and over to try and hit the conc with veiled ??
[2022-12-31 18:56:35] <@%GoGoLoThirty> GGG have invested a ton of juice into minions over the last few years so, maybe its time they get nerfed LUL

[2022-12-31 18:57:07] <%SearingDarkness> Spending 30 hours pre-league to make a build that might be bunk af isnt really fun to most people so the guides are great
[2022-12-31 18:57:11] <@%GoGoLoThirty> @LightcallerTV a lot of ppl are getting 1 lvl 20 gem with horror and then awakener orb a relevant shaper affix on. but yeah global 911 are great at helms
[2022-12-31 18:57:15] <%+LightcallerTV> /thumbs I will check it there
[2022-12-31 18:57:45] <Stoptripp> i mean i think this game is bout discovering stuff. u cant just do same thing as evbery one doin it. i love copying people build but i also toss some different things
[2022-12-31 18:58:06] <weebtrashington> lilybelleWiggly this game is diverse i love it
[2022-12-31 18:58:19] <@%lemoncoolers> @Stoptripp people learn in different ways. I learned by copying what's good and that helped me to understand why it is good.

[2022-12-31 20:41:46] <+Pro_Mitchell> have you not found immortal flesh yet? or can you not fit it?

[2022-12-31 20:44:30] <+Solomon_Kain> The end of the campaign is largely fine since it goes so quick, but the begginging sucks ass, no movement skills, no clear skills, just awful feeling gameplay for 50 levels and a LOT of running.

[2022-12-31 21:08:33] <Scredicus> im not either but i wanna do the achi and get some costumes @GoGoLoThirty
[2022-12-31 21:08:37] <@%GoGoLoThirty> @imsenpae you can do ubers without any of that stuff
[2022-12-31 21:08:44] <lore_twitch> I linked curse with inc duration and faster casting and it's super smooth
[2022-12-31 21:09:01] <big_glebowski> Do u have some good rf player's in mind? I am in a late end-game and there is a lot guys in poe ninja and all of them very different. Can u advise someone?
[2022-12-31 21:09:02] <%SolidLogik> why is finding gear upgrades so difficult in SSF!? So frustrating when you don't have the currency to craft what you need
[2022-12-31 21:09:13] <@%GoGoLoThirty> @big_glebowski HUH
[2022-12-31 21:09:16] <BagramXS> so it is possible to do ubers with rf dicently ?

[2022-12-31 21:10:37] <@%GoGoLoThirty> @big_glebowski you can still look up on the FAQ and the discord and global 911 and his softcore sanctum character
[2022-12-31 21:10:39] <+ArcticIceFox> @ArcticIceFox any reason why?
[2022-12-31 21:10:44] <Scredicus> i like this build because its so fast in maps
[2022-12-31 21:10:48] <@%GoGoLoThirty> @ArcticIceFox it doesnt give as much damage reduction
[2022-12-31 21:10:51] <+ArcticIceFox> gotcha

[2022-12-31 21:10:55] <+ArcticIceFox> didnt see it on the FAQ
[2022-12-31 21:11:01] <+ArcticIceFox> thought id ask here
[2022-12-31 21:11:06] <BagramXS> 911 was it ?
[2022-12-31 21:11:10] <Scredicus> but for the bosses its so slow an alsa sanctum is so hard to do
[2022-12-31 21:11:20] <@%GoGoLoThirty> @BagramXS yeah global channel 911 is good advice if you want ingame chat
[2022-12-31 21:11:27] <+Pro_Mitchell> I'm guessing you don't like Delve much? I'd be curious how deep you can make it in SSF

[2022-12-31 21:11:35] <big_glebowski> in 911 it is about luck - sometimes there is a plenty supprotive people, sometimes a lot toxic. Ur discord i didnt try, but now i will. Thanks pal
[2022-12-31 21:11:43] <+lzopian_fury> Does reduced Ignite duration effect RF damage to self?  Basically would it be okay to run gear with it?
[2022-12-31 21:11:51] <@%GoGoLoThirty> @Pro_Mitchell this build is actually super sick for delve. can go normal depths like 200-250
[2022-12-31 21:12:15] <Nazrum> Im all day in 911 i never se toxic shit
[2022-12-31 21:12:15] <tatiantel7> the minion channel is way more toxic if you ever go there
[2022-12-31 21:12:20] <@%lemoncoolers> @big_glebowski Not to be rude but you aren't owed an answer. You just have to ask your question to the wind and maybe you'll get help maybe you won't.

[2022-12-31 22:25:30] <Bubsuuu> Is there a guide you would point people to when they want to learn SSF?
[2022-12-31 22:25:55] <ozhiukas> which boss is harder-regular shaper or catarina?
[2022-12-31 22:25:59] VIEWERS: 785
[2022-12-31 22:26:02] <adolebitque> "Learning SSF" is trying it, playing a build and asking people for advice when you run into a problem on your playthrough
[2022-12-31 22:26:08] <@%lemoncoolers> @ozhiukas shaper for sure
[2022-12-31 22:26:25] <%+Deedledo> thers a ziz vid he did with steel talking about ssf progression on his poe university playlist
[2022-12-31 22:26:26] <+mr_secsy> good night
[2022-12-31 22:26:29] <@%lemoncoolers> imo regular shaper is harder than maven
[2022-12-31 22:26:32] <ozhiukas> @lemoncoolers ty
[2022-12-31 22:26:40] <Bubsuuu> @Deedledo Ah there is? I will search it up, thanks!
[2022-12-31 22:27:04] <%Whizer> does the % of effect of scorch on legacy of fury is important or not
[2022-12-31 22:27:10] <+snaykuh> more like  2 min fight lol
[2022-12-31 22:27:17] <%+Deedledo> but... i would say....just do it. youll learn it as you go. you might make a mistake.....but we learn from mistakes.

[2022-12-31 22:29:56] <adolebitque> Is the scorch effect not a worthy mod to look into?

[2022-12-31 22:30:44] <%+Deedledo> @Deedledo best piece of advice i can say...is just play the game. youll learn as you play. just hop in, kill some monsters. get loot. focus on like 1 or 2 mechs at a time and learn that, then move to the next thing. but if you treat itr as a normal arpg and just kill monsters you ll be ok
[2022-12-31 22:30:48] <Tom2> happy new years all o/
