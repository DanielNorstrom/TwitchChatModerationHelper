[2022-12-27 17:48:43] <%+Kreeped> I think we're seeing a lot of terrible content creators, who create shit for clicks/views ONLY. Very rarely is content legit, its all for a purpose now it feels.

[2022-12-27 17:50:56] <%RealityOGX> Hasan had a unique perspective, he literally doesnt do anything else but stream, even personal stuff outside his house he steams mobile. Some creators its all about content content content, every hour of the day. You cant keep up with those peeps even with a healthy 4 -5 stream a week routine.

[2022-12-27 17:51:31] <%RealityOGX> These guys have enough money to literally stream themselves watching OTHER YT vids and have donations/subs flying in

[2022-12-27 17:53:38] <%$icndothsallday> @kreeped I think YT needs to separate the gaming streams from the main site, twitch itself feels like a more exclusive place to be
[2022-12-27 17:53:52] <%RealityOGX> YT has almost 2 billion active users, Twitch has around 250 million, its not even comparable

[2022-12-27 18:01:42] <%+Kreeped> Twitch is passed its prime for sure. Twitch probably isn't actively banning bots because the views impact its advertising and marketing costs. Much like Twitter wasn't doing much because it inflates numbers artificially with bots.
[2022-12-27 18:02:00] <%+Kreeped> Its a shady industry.
