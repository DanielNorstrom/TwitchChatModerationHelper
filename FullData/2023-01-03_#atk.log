[2023-01-03 15:16:21] <ibgsehdev> hey guys i just tried getting on the game i had vpn on in the background didnt realise so my game didnt let me in, could i get banned or am i fine
[2023-01-03 15:16:31] <Distxnct_> Ags should improve their servers even though I’m not sure it’s a server issue
[2023-01-03 15:16:40] <+hanzi47> @AHappyWhale logged in, dc twice in 5 minutes, logged off KEKW
[2023-01-03 15:16:50] <year_sheesh> @Distxnct_ pretty sure some anticheat file issue

[2023-01-03 15:17:30] <Distxnct_> People also use vpn to play on Korea and Russia
[2023-01-03 15:17:34] <Distxnct_> So….
[2023-01-03 15:17:42] <ibgsehdev> @Distxnct_ oh fair enough should be okay then
[2023-01-03 15:17:53] <%+deadlypants112> didnt benji get banned for vpn
[2023-01-03 15:17:54] <Moonarchy> i also use a vpn to play, should be fine
[2023-01-03 15:17:56] <ibgsehdev> plus i didnt even login to the game

[2023-01-03 15:18:30] <+nankai0099> @Distxnct_ are you sure ? for register account in Korea you need ID Card :)
[2023-01-03 15:18:34] <ibgsehdev> @deadlypants112 i think that was a different reason something to do with korean ip
[2023-01-03 15:18:35] <itzores> guys do you know any vpn that has russian servers? i wanna play on russia but i can't find a vpn
[2023-01-03 15:18:40] <Distxnct_> @nankai0099 FailFish I know
[2023-01-03 15:18:53] <Distxnct_> @itzores how can you not find vpn
[2023-01-03 15:18:56] <Moonarchy> pretty sure no vpns have russian servers atm
[2023-01-03 15:19:15] <Distxnct_> Also I would never use Russian servers on a vpn
[2023-01-03 15:19:20] <Distxnct_> But that’s just me
[2023-01-03 15:19:31] <itzores> @Distxnct_ why?
[2023-01-03 15:19:36] <Distxnct_> Not like they have a good internet infrastructure
[2023-01-03 15:19:38] <ibgsehdev> @Moonarchy mudfish vpn works

[2023-01-03 15:20:38] <%+killersiroko> @itzores Exitlag does. However they havent been updated what so ever. I played to test reaper and they are at the same point as west now but no QOL updates at all
[2023-01-03 15:20:59] <Moonarchy> does the russian lost ark even need a vpn? you just need the program game centre and you're good, no?
[2023-01-03 15:21:10] <Distxnct_> @moonarchy you still need vpn
[2023-01-03 15:21:18] <gamma21> you do need a VPN to launch the game

[2023-01-03 16:26:39] <AntipainK> Reflux needs crit and swiftness
[2023-01-03 16:26:39] <Raulalhi> repairr
[2023-01-03 16:26:54] <+joshstation2> the thing is that they are doing some wierd build on maxroll, the casting variant and i dont know why they think they should go spec
[2023-01-03 16:27:09] <Xtra_Step> igniter engraving adds crit chance and crit dmg, and reduces cd of skills
[2023-01-03 16:27:38] <AntipainK> @joshstation2 Just checked, on Casting they still go 1500crit 500 swift
[2023-01-03 16:27:47] <wheelchair_store4> your armor is red
[2023-01-03 16:27:50] <Xtra_Step> not a single reflux build uses spec
[2023-01-03 16:27:50] <AntipainK> You probably've seen wrong
[2023-01-03 16:27:53] <%+Ryougui> @joshstation2 not even casting use spec, all reflux builds are crit/swift in the proportion you want
[2023-01-03 16:28:08] <ChairoPear> @wheelchair_store4 in hellmode doesnt matter

[2023-01-03 16:29:03] <+joshstation2> @Ryougui yeah thats what i told them and they said nah i want spec for more damage
[2023-01-03 16:29:13] <+joshstation2> very HUH of them
[2023-01-03 16:29:41] <AntipainK> To be honest you should also go for Igniter build imo. It's much more interesting and more rewarding
[2023-01-03 16:29:43] <Xtra_Step> spec scales the dmg boost of your Z, you can't use Z as reflux, that's just Dentge
[2023-01-03 16:30:12] <AntipainK> 4x3 is a cheap build and you'll probably outdamage a lot of 5x3 classes
[2023-01-03 16:30:28] <Nic0s0> you can giga blink tho KEK

[2023-01-03 16:32:21] <mynameismaxipoo> albert your character is naked you need to equip armour

[2023-01-03 16:32:47] <AntipainK> @teazer95120 I'd consider swapping master ambush for cursed doll man
[2023-01-03 16:33:07] <AntipainK> You get other back attack bonuses, which are additive to what you already have
[2023-01-03 16:33:14] <AntipainK> from the gear set e.g.
[2023-01-03 16:33:16] <KyloQo> @teazer95120 trixion
[2023-01-03 16:33:27] <Xtra_Step> db with no ambush is troll as hell, what are you on
[2023-01-03 16:33:27] <teazer95120> trixion seems to be farly similar
[2023-01-03 16:33:35] <teazer95120> and anyway trixion is not so realistic
[2023-01-03 16:34:03] <thetargets> @ATK Nice red gear <3
[2023-01-03 16:34:07] <AntipainK> @teazer95120 tell me about it. my dps bard deals consistent 3.5million dps in trixion xd

[2023-01-03 16:34:47] <KyloQo> @teazer95120 this people doesnt do "realistic" measurement tho just based on what they think

[2023-01-03 16:35:41] <teazer95120> If i play entropy + high crit neck would i rly not crit much without adre 3
[2023-01-03 16:35:53] <AntipainK> @teazer95120 You can try going for just x1 on Remaining Energy and x2 on Adrenaline

[2023-01-03 16:36:40] <Xtra_Step> a high crit neck is still only 20%, with entropy and back attack that' only 47%, very low considering the crit dmg you get from entropy

[2023-01-03 16:37:50] <AntipainK> not gear sets nor ilvl tho
[2023-01-03 16:38:08] <+TaaviXIV> @Nic0s0 Adrenaline is always better, unless you have alot of small numbers
[2023-01-03 16:38:10] <AntipainK> @teazer95120 or just roll for 9/7 stone and build 5x3+1 xd

[2023-01-03 17:52:00] <+Teitu_> cd*
[2023-01-03 17:52:08] <%Minikuro> even lvl 8 is fine, lvl 7 is too tight to mess up but still doable with swiftness
[2023-01-03 17:52:10] <ZenithWho> rc
[2023-01-03 17:52:20] <ZenithWho> theres no space for cursed doll on the build unless u get a 9/7

[2023-01-03 17:52:36] <%monts18> 5 classes are expensive too

[2023-01-03 17:52:53] <ZenithWho> @zhoukidd spec or swift/crit
[2023-01-03 17:52:53] <happy_but_sad> for some reason every di acce costs 80k+
[2023-01-03 17:52:57] <+arcanegast> Just build 4x3 class x2 and when you buy all the books you get 5x3
[2023-01-03 17:52:57] <+Teitu_> spec crit is playable with cursed doll? or raid captain?
[2023-01-03 17:53:01] <+Teitu_> spec swift*
[2023-01-03 17:53:02] <%feond> ppl take supports with 2x2 too ok just reroll

[2023-01-03 17:53:18] <+tsubasafish1> is it worth buying a 2 stat bracelet with one rollable line for ~20-30k in NAE?

[2023-01-03 17:53:22] <ZenithWho> though that requires 95 qual +
[2023-01-03 17:53:24] <+tsubasafish1> or better to just wait and natural something decent

[2023-01-03 18:01:24] <ZenithWho> @ZenithWho yeah technically entropy is the strongest build for it, but the qualtiy of the class makes the build really hard to execute

[2023-01-03 23:29:08] <%+er_buffalo> I think im missing something but where does crit come from for a striker... necklace +17-18% entropy +17_(or 19 cant remember) back attack 10% and lightning stomp move move is 10%... what am i missing? cuz thats only 55ish and keen blunt is supposed to be minimum of 60 right? taking adren 2 would make it +10 more so i guess i just answered my own question maybe idk lol
[2023-01-03 23:29:17] <NoxNumbers> no you cant
[2023-01-03 23:29:35] <%+er_buffalo> i think i was forgetting back attack +10
[2023-01-03 23:29:49] <%yoohyeonisn> or in battle counts too HUH
[2023-01-03 23:29:51] <+lagnumber> @er_buffalo synergy
[2023-01-03 23:30:03] <%+amuulia> isnt lightning whisper 18% too
[2023-01-03 23:30:07] <NoxNumbers> as long as its raining in battle and he levels its fine
[2023-01-03 23:30:17] <thegaynote> @er_buffalo im sure lightning whisper is -18% crit resistance though the tripod shows -10%

[2023-01-03 23:31:31] <NoxNumbers> you need rain though
[2023-01-03 23:31:54] <+lostarkfan4life> hey ATK late grats on 97. how many stones did it take?
[2023-01-03 23:32:01] <%+ZeroTwo100> memento
[2023-01-03 23:32:10] <NoxNumbers> memento is suicide move that lowers opponents offensive stats
[2023-01-03 23:32:17] <NoxNumbers> but you sac yourself
[2023-01-03 23:32:21] <thegaynote> i have alt striker too with 5x3 with adrenaline 3 ofc and in trixion i got 70%++ Crit rate assuming you can always back attack
[2023-01-03 23:32:22] <%yoohyeonisn> he got another 97? HUH
[2023-01-03 23:32:31] <NiShiFeiDeTudou> it's useful in competitive for certain strats
[2023-01-03 23:32:41] <+lostarkfan4life> nah i mean the first one

[2023-01-03 23:33:07] <%yoohyeonisn> KEKG
[2023-01-03 23:33:15] <@%+Shikiro> +17-20% entropy, +17 (crit necklace), +18% Lightning Whisper, +10% Adren 2 = 62% crit @er_buffalo
[2023-01-03 23:33:36] <%+er_buffalo> @thegaynote the trixion crit rate numbers can be altered by other skills im purely thinking about the lightning tiger strike having enough.
[2023-01-03 23:33:41] <%+ZeroTwo100> if he did it would have failed lol
[2023-01-03 23:33:48] <NiShiFeiDeTudou> oh apparently it has to be raining in the environment can't use rain dance
[2023-01-03 23:33:59] <thegaynote> @Shikiro +10% in back attack
[2023-01-03 23:33:59] <NoxNumbers> monkaW
[2023-01-03 23:34:08] <%+er_buffalo> @Shikiro plus back attack makes it 72 nice!

[2023-01-03 23:34:24] <NoxNumbers> are you sure
[2023-01-03 23:34:30] <@%+Shikiro> i almost never count back attack cause there's chances when you aren't going to hit the back
[2023-01-03 23:34:32] <@%+Shikiro> KEKL
[2023-01-03 23:34:32] <thegaynote> @er_buffalo if you have level 3 adrenaline thats 77% crit rate
