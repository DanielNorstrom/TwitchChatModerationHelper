[2022-12-22 14:34:00] <lyzielle> by Tal Ben-Shahar While it is part of our universal nature to seek pleasure and avoid pain, culture plays a central role in how we deal with suffering. In the West, we generally reject suffering. We see it as an unwelcome interruption of our pursuit of happiness. So we fight it, repress it, medicate it, or search for quick-fix solutions to get rid of it. In some cultures, especially in the East, suffering is acknowledged for the important role it plays in people‚Äôs lives.
[2022-12-22 14:34:00] <%+Jungleboogie30> They dont care about ques for tanks because theres not as many tanks as supports/dps

[2022-12-22 20:16:17] <Steamblox> it's still annoying how you have to charge the middle of the javelin spin or it just pushes the charge back

[2022-12-22 20:16:32] <%TorgueWeaponry> I loved Orisa in OW1, was sad to come back after a couple years and find out that she was a completely different character.
[2022-12-22 20:16:33] <%+xbands1ips> the one time I have raged at this game was when I got illios against a roadhog and he kept fucking hooking me into well
[2022-12-22 20:16:43] <%anung> even after all the reworks Orisa gameplay is ResidentSleeper
[2022-12-22 20:16:46] <%+xbands1ips> orisa in ow1 was so boring lol
[2022-12-22 20:16:53] <Gryffe> Beggare94 I dont care about keeping ult charge, but thats actually a separate issue because of how 'press Q to win' some ults are. what I meant is that the change they made allows you to keep some ult charge when swapping, whereas before you lost it all, further incentivizes swapping heroes
[2022-12-22 20:16:54] <eskbeemo> i hate fortify + spear spin cause no1 can stop her from pushing you into a corner.
[2022-12-22 20:17:01] <Steamblox> how's rammatra been so far?
[2022-12-22 20:17:27] <%+xbands1ips> fortify should not work against melee attacks, or only work against them. It's just so broken as is
[2022-12-22 20:17:31] <Gryffe> Beggare94 I admit that it was even worse before this change, because you were simultaneously incenvitized to swap to a hard counter and punished for it, by losing the ult charge

He comes equipped with a very powerful height adjusting lever that‚Äôs perfect for our favorite streamer. LHChair doesn‚Äôt interact much so it‚Äôs really helps when chat can make their own content

[2022-12-22 21:30:12] <orchlonslidltip> Widowmaker and Lucio were two of the best agents in Overwatch. They were assigned to a mission to retrieve sensitive information from a heavily guarded facility. They worked well together, with Widowmaker's stealthy approach complementing Lucio's support. After completing the mission, they realized they had feelings for each other. They returned to base and began a relationship, finding happiness and love in each other's company.

[2022-12-22 22:04:52] <+Xeffary> yeah i wanted them to just remove the speed penalty on block
[2022-12-22 22:05:06] <terrestrialbug> maybe give rein speed boost when he has no armor SeemsGood
[2022-12-22 22:05:15] <MaximilianYeet> at this point every new tank has speed boost :(
[2022-12-22 22:05:40] <Tim_sh> rammatra ult so op?

[2022-12-22 22:05:57] <%issallassi> all them hours wasted on useless hammer hero
[2022-12-22 22:05:59] <terrestrialbug> there should be a limit tho for his ult so it's not infinite
[2022-12-22 22:06:16] <Razmann1> feels like some dmg reduction calculation could go wrong, just like it was with brig LUL
[2022-12-22 22:06:30] <terrestrialbug> yeah but in overtime it's constant NotLikeThis
[2022-12-22 22:06:38] <OneManArmystar> Rammatra ult is actually op because of the 20% speed. And with nano on him is even more broken.

[2022-12-22 22:07:01] <Razmann1> one could argue sig ult is op on overtime..
[2022-12-22 22:07:18] <terrestrialbug> meanwhile rein might as well shatter air BibleThump
[2022-12-22 22:07:25] <Mazehar> another of ults in overtime become much better
[2022-12-22 22:07:36] <Mazehar> alot*
[2022-12-22 22:07:45] <%MapleRoar> As people get used to Ram they'll start to play out of his ult range better
[2022-12-22 22:07:57] <%alaviiva__> even if you hit a crazy shatter
[2022-12-22 22:08:02] <%alaviiva__> because you commit and you're playing rein
[2022-12-22 22:08:03] <%alaviiva__> you just die

[2022-12-22 23:05:46] <y04rm0m> I think Lucio + Ram might beccome meta...if lucio can speed boost him around, he has infinite ult
[2022-12-22 23:05:46] <%scarlet_ow8> today gm?
[2022-12-22 23:05:50] <%mixeryow> Can orisa speer cancel his block?
[2022-12-22 23:05:54] <hotwheelsmans> ramattra is good you have two live  with you nemesis form ten after using your ult

[2022-12-22 23:06:32] <%Magicturtle12> i miss orisa's grav PoroSad
[2022-12-22 23:06:35] <%mixeryow> Orisa is so insane op i play her in ranked everytime because shes uncounterable
[2022-12-22 23:06:39] <y04rm0m> Rein is C tier

[2022-12-22 23:07:05] VIEWERS: 450
[2022-12-22 23:07:08] <Retaliator3> They need to buff rein
[2022-12-22 23:07:18] <%+thelastp0rg> Go monkey and dive back line yea
[2022-12-22 23:07:32] <Retaliator3> Like every hero gets upgraded
[2022-12-22 23:07:36] <Retaliator3> but Rein
[2022-12-22 23:07:38] <xitah99> And the back line is Lucio Kiriko
[2022-12-22 23:07:46] <%mixeryow> I think rein slept with the sister from one dev
[2022-12-22 23:07:51] <xitah99> good luck diving that
[2022-12-22 23:08:02] <DomskiPlays> U GOT IT??? :D
[2022-12-22 23:08:07] <%+thelastp0rg> Up orisa‚Äôs cooldowns by like 0.5s?
[2022-12-22 23:08:07] <wombburned_warlock> Ramtarra :/ where OG hammer man
[2022-12-22 23:08:07] <Retaliator3> Surefour was also saying today that Rein is the only real tank left and Kragie too
[2022-12-22 23:08:18] <+chistelorr> i like how everyone Was saying that saying hog is OP is a skill issue and now He dominates every rank
[2022-12-22 23:08:21] <DomskiPlays> masters is top 500 AINTNOWAY
[2022-12-22 23:08:30] <+blazz3n> I like the music you play
[2022-12-22 23:08:35] <y04rm0m> @Retaliator3 Surefour and Kragie are the same person, that's only 1 opinion
[2022-12-22 23:08:52] <KAT_1> woww in masters
[2022-12-22 23:08:55] <KAT_1> lesgo
[2022-12-22 23:09:01] <%mixeryow> can you have the top 500 icon without playing 50 games
[2022-12-22 23:09:03] <Retaliator3> I think Ramatra is a Junkerqueen type of tank, fun to play but not meta
[2022-12-22 23:09:05] VIEWERS: 450
[2022-12-22 23:09:09] <tankmain1337> how to die less as ram?
[2022-12-22 23:09:10] <xitah99> Orisa is more fun to play than Hog too. Playing Hog sucks ass
[2022-12-22 23:09:16] <chazm> how to win against ram ult
[2022-12-22 23:09:45] <+chistelorr> Queen is what hog should be imo
[2022-12-22 23:09:45] <hotwheelsmans> or use shield and run away lol
[2022-12-22 23:09:50] <+stevenvsq> winston just bubble ram ult instant cancel
[2022-12-22 23:09:57] <%mixeryow> Pharah ult into ram ult
[2022-12-22 23:09:59] <Retaliator3> Giving Orisa ult through shield was such a brain dead move.
[2022-12-22 23:09:59] <%mixeryow> Ez
[2022-12-22 23:10:06] <y04rm0m> @chazm "just shoot the head"-eevee for mercy's flight speed
[2022-12-22 23:10:23] <Retaliator3> They just don't want people to play Rein
[2022-12-22 23:10:38] <+Wh00pSid3iZi> bring back 2k shield
[2022-12-22 23:10:53] <Retaliator3> Orisa ult is so bad
[2022-12-22 23:11:00] <%mixeryow> Thats not true
