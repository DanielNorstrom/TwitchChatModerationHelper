[2022-12-25 01:08:18] <!%$Murnco> "Linux" can just be a terminal. It all depends on the ditrso and the UI and how you want it to look.
[2022-12-25 01:08:21] <%+Zithras2> Windows 98 is better anyway!
[2022-12-25 01:08:25] <%+murixbob> In fairness they're are so many flavors of Linux and some have very old UI designs
[2022-12-25 01:08:30] <demysyke> Linux now dependng on the branch looks sooo goo. especially Garuda Linux. It looks so smooth and polished.
[2022-12-25 01:08:37] <!%Jack_Carsons_Rail_Videos> BTW love the overlay sakuStory
[2022-12-25 01:08:37] <@%Smashface_Games> its mega customizable. also depends if it was one of the buntus or like red hat etc

[2022-12-25 01:11:50] <!%$Murnco> I like doors
[2022-12-25 01:11:54] <!%+AbyssalKitten11> so I got the stream casting to my TV and it's keeps crashing and going back to my phone sakuFite
[2022-12-25 01:12:22] <@%Smashface_Games> The Doors is pretty good!
[2022-12-25 01:12:41] <%+Zithras2> @murixbob VM is definitely easier than dualboot, but there's not a lot of reason to VM linux - you'd be better off either dualbooting or running a Windows VM in linux.  I wish AFNI had a windows version :(

[2022-12-25 01:13:31] <!%$Murnco> It's a little insulating layer but still lets the cold come through without freezer burning it.
[2022-12-25 01:13:35] <%+Zithras2> stream keeps momentarily hanging for me, but i think its because i havent restarted my computer in a week
[2022-12-25 01:13:47] <@%Smashface_Games> did you put these in the snow to keep them cool?

[2022-12-25 02:35:20] <%Lagzuzu_> i walk the buffet and pick whatever my brain tells me to eat
[2022-12-25 02:35:21] <@%TidusZecht> if I have to grab a 2nd plate to get what I want, I have enough after that lol

[2022-12-25 02:36:28] <%Lagzuzu_> lol
[2022-12-25 02:36:28] <%+Hyperstryke> I was about to say.
[2022-12-25 02:36:29] <%Coy_Stream> cheese is not a condiment
[2022-12-25 02:36:33] <@%TidusZecht> gravy and cheese are condiments?
[2022-12-25 02:36:35] <Elosacle> that's a genius idea, saku. using fries as a condiment
[2022-12-25 02:36:42] <!%$Murnco> sakuHype
[2022-12-25 02:36:44] <%+murixbob> curds are different then full on cheese though.
[2022-12-25 02:36:48] <%+Hyperstryke> Gravy is, but cheese and fries are not.
[2022-12-25 02:36:49] <%WitnessProtection_> @Coy_Stream parmesian begs to differ

[2022-12-25 02:37:10] <%Lagzuzu_> so i can buy poutine, and use it on my steak as a condiment
[2022-12-25 02:37:24] <@%KiseSwiftmist> You all remember the Mrs. Doubtfire movie, where Robin Williams sets the kitchen on fire, then orders food. When I first met Saku, that what I thought Saku did
[2022-12-25 02:37:26] <@%Smashface_Games> It's also a salad!
[2022-12-25 02:37:27] <%Coy_Stream> the wikipedia page for condiments only lists maple syrup under canada

[2022-12-25 02:37:40] <%+Hyperstryke> Just like I can get a chicken and waffles poutine, but that doesn't make waffles or chicken condiments.
[2022-12-25 02:37:49] <%saku_is_my_waifu> but condiments not allowed on the broccoli
[2022-12-25 02:38:03] <@%TidusZecht> what's the difference between a fruit salad and a regular salad Kappa
[2022-12-25 02:38:10] <%+Hyperstryke> And it is.

[2022-12-25 03:13:30] <%+Zithras2> I dont think i've tried cottage cheese in lasagna - usually use ricotta and mozzarella layers

[2022-12-25 03:13:51] <!%SereneSnake> Ricotta is a must in lasagna, imo.
[2022-12-25 03:13:53] <%saku_is_my_waifu> or you could have Walmart deliver you somebody else's order full of lasagna ingredients instead of yours. (this really happen to me like 2 weeks ago).
[2022-12-25 03:14:14] <%Lagzuzu_> Ricotta costs atleast one finger
[2022-12-25 03:14:15] <%Lagzuzu_> per ounce
[2022-12-25 03:14:26] <!%SereneSnake> Gotta catch them sales.
[2022-12-25 03:14:26] <%Lagzuzu_> but there is dry cottage cheese?
[2022-12-25 03:14:35] <@%KiseSwiftmist> Next on Saku's Throne list....Ricotta Cheese
[2022-12-25 03:14:44] <@%TidusZecht> all cheese is good. gouda is cheese. therefore all cheese is gouda
[2022-12-25 03:14:46] <%Lagzuzu_> where is dry cottage cheese?
[2022-12-25 03:15:12] <%saku_is_my_waifu> I reordered and got my order the same day. they told me to keep the other ingredients
[2022-12-25 03:15:15] <%Lagzuzu_> huh?
[2022-12-25 03:15:31] <!%$Murnco> I assume it's just not in a brine...
[2022-12-25 03:15:33] <%Insane_Monday> This is my first time hearing of dry cottage cheese

[2022-12-25 03:32:07] <+Hyperstryke> That depends: Do I really want to knock a game off my backlog? If so, no.

[2022-12-25 03:32:23] <%saku_is_my_waifu> I am on vacation through the 2nd
[2022-12-25 03:32:35] <%Insane_Monday> @Hyperstryke What game are you looking to knock off your backlog?
[2022-12-25 03:33:00] <!%$Murnco> I just need to be here in case of emergency basically. So as long as poo stays off the fan, it is pretty chill

[2022-12-25 03:35:50] <%saku_is_my_waifu> there are a few games where the final boss is a joke, like just a QTE. hopefully Saku does not struggle on those one.
[2022-12-25 03:35:59] <@%Smashface_Games> Yeah that was some luck sakuLUL
[2022-12-25 03:36:39] <@%Smashface_Games> saku is a QTE sakuLurk and so is chat
[2022-12-25 03:36:41] <+Hyperstryke> It's a souls-like game where the main character is delving through memories to find the truth about a plague that ravaged his home.
[2022-12-25 03:37:00] <%+Zithras2> Gotta love the Borderlands boss at the top of the stairs...

[2022-12-25 03:48:52] <%Insane_Monday> @Kingdomkey5995 I haven't done that, but I have terrorized my nephew with using an excessive amount of ribbons on a gift, loading a gift bag with an excessive amount of the gift paper (like 3-4 packages of the stuff)
[2022-12-25 03:49:12] <Sjach_Miirik> @Kingdomkey5995 that reminds me of a shirt i saw at work that states, "im going to put myself under the tree to remind my family i am a gift"
