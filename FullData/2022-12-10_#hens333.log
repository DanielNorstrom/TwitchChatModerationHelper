[2022-12-10 16:15:30] <MergosWetNurse> cuz of nowhere to hide
[2022-12-10 16:15:30] <!%BekahW_> because killers use so many aura perks, i guess haha

[2022-12-10 16:20:46] <@%Steffano__> @darkshadowsniperangel i mean you can get monitors with crosshairs built in so (no it's not bannable)
[2022-12-10 16:20:56] <%Yumivers> can you still jump over holes as demo tho?
[2022-12-10 16:21:00] <%MrRyanFish> Have you seen anyone walk over a trapper trap in a snowman? i assume they get trapped right?

[2022-12-10 16:21:17] <darkshadowsniperangel> @Steffano__ what if I have a crosshair application? I am lazy to find tape and get it on screen xd
[2022-12-10 16:21:27] <Kenzou8> what about shredding over it ?
[2022-12-10 16:21:28] <@%Steffano__> crosshair applications are fine Prayge
[2022-12-10 16:21:29] <%FEJNGY> holy shit I forgot what default Oni looks like
[2022-12-10 16:21:29] <%ClussyHonks> i think its because every survivor (almost) is fed up with the gen builds that killers have making the game last longer, maybe im right or wrong
[2022-12-10 16:21:34] <darkshadowsniperangel> thx
[2022-12-10 16:22:03] <@%Steffano__> but quite a lot of modern monitors have a crosshair option in their settings menus
[2022-12-10 16:22:05] <!%YourFriendLumpy> gotta facecam to show monitor
[2022-12-10 16:22:19] <%not_tobo> @Steffano__ yep, mine have one ^^
[2022-12-10 16:22:29] <Kenzou8> im gonna try out if i can shred over the hole on badham
[2022-12-10 16:22:30] <pteeepot> hey hens, what do you think about the event so far?
[2022-12-10 16:22:37] <%FEJNGY> @YourFriendLumpy where have I heard that before Clueless
[2022-12-10 16:22:38] <@%Steffano__> OMEGALUL facecam but its to prove you're not running a crosshair on huntress
[2022-12-10 16:22:43] <%+noboolipls> There’s something cool about aiming not using a crosshair in this game but I don’t see a reason why they don’t add it tbh
[2022-12-10 16:22:45] <%MrRyanFish> @ClussyHonks Nah, people DC for any reason, I had someone DC cause I waited out their dead hard.
[2022-12-10 16:23:02] <%KaliasTV> It's the sort of thing a more reasonable developer would put in the options
[2022-12-10 16:23:12] <%ClussyHonks> @MrRyanFish based KEKW
[2022-12-10 16:23:17] <waltonbago> Mid event
[2022-12-10 16:23:22] <%FEJNGY> its been like that for a long time
[2022-12-10 16:23:29] <Dr_K3tchup> Deathslinger doesn't even shoot from the middle, my crosshair is set at -1, 11
[2022-12-10 16:23:31] <@%Ana1661> THAT'S what I was saying
[2022-12-10 16:23:40] <@%Ana1661> And you answered me "why not"
[2022-12-10 16:23:46] <%MrRyanFish> Wait you want it to be like how it was last year? where people are allowed to have 7 hits
[2022-12-10 16:23:47] <%FEJNGY> I love pink sword
[2022-12-10 16:23:53] <pteeepot> yeah queue times have been weird recently, especially since theres more players
[2022-12-10 16:23:54] <@%animeangel09> weekend gaming
[2022-12-10 16:23:57] <@%Ana1661> Anything pink is pog
[2022-12-10 16:24:01] <Kenzou8> holy fck are these que times long "not in que" OMEGALUL
[2022-12-10 16:24:06] <Martyr01> everyone plays killer in the morning, swf arent awake yet LUL
[2022-12-10 16:24:08] <littlemsjester> Hopefully this game goes better ^^ It’s more fun when people play

[2022-12-10 16:24:11] <@%Steffano__> @Ana1661 any bias in that statement?

[2022-12-10 16:24:28] <+RezedentSleeper> i matched a sadako inside a snowman but she still had red stain
[2022-12-10 16:24:30] <Yaboi__nate> i think they kinda botched it this year, it would be more fun if the survivors could take an extra hit but killers could also use their powers in the snowmen
[2022-12-10 16:24:31] <!%BekahW_> KEKW
[2022-12-10 16:24:32] <@%Ana1661> Not not at all Stevie Clueless

[2022-12-10 16:25:07] <Dr_K3tchup> Is franklins good? I've been using it on m1 killers and I'm getting really nice results
[2022-12-10 16:25:09] <%diirtyydan> i want the ruin pop meta back
[2022-12-10 16:25:12] <+xelamain> Bring back ruin :(
[2022-12-10 16:25:14] <+Tiger267> Any reason the incentive +100% blood points is gone?
[2022-12-10 16:25:16] <@%Steffano__> @Dr_K3tchup NoNo franklins is stinki
[2022-12-10 16:25:16] <%diirtyydan> i miss the good old chasing times
[2022-12-10 16:25:26] <@%Ana1661> I totally don't have pink hair, pink dress, pink watch, pink phone, pink water bottle, and pink everything I can get Stevie
[2022-12-10 16:25:29] <%MrRyanFish> @Yaboi__nate Nah extra hit in snowmen was bum. nothing like having to leave a survivor after eating their dead hard and then they got into a snowmen in your cooldown.
[2022-12-10 16:25:32] <%FEJNGY> I don't think that's gonna happen any time soon
[2022-12-10 16:25:34] <willi_zn> my toughts when im stoned LMAO
[2022-12-10 16:25:34] <%vkaim> oni gameplay Pog
[2022-12-10 16:25:41] <waltonbago> I would love for that aswell
[2022-12-10 16:25:43] <@%Ana1661> And I totally don't have my DbD with a pink hue
[2022-12-10 16:25:44] <Demented_Hag> overcharged and brine stack?
[2022-12-10 16:25:56] <littlemsjester> I feel like when a survivor dies, the other survivors should an action speed boost of 1 or 2%. Discourage tunnelling and encourage spreading hooks
[2022-12-10 16:25:57] <Dr_K3tchup> @Dr_K3tchup stinki bad me want no stinki no more
[2022-12-10 16:25:57] <%diirtyydan> Demented_Hag yes they do
[2022-12-10 16:26:04] <%not_tobo> @Demented_Hag yes
[2022-12-10 16:26:15] <@%Steffano__> @Ana1661 fair enough Prayge
[2022-12-10 16:26:17] <Demented_Hag> ty
[2022-12-10 16:26:29] <@%Ana1661> @Yaboi__nate Idk Ryan I think it was very fun that they changed gameplay, not it's just mid
[2022-12-10 16:26:35] <%vkaim> i bought a moyai statuette yesterday

[2022-12-10 16:26:58] <Dr_K3tchup> the way I've seen most comp Onis play is Bloodlusting the first hit on a normal loop
[2022-12-10 16:27:12] <%BushiNoKurodo> @MrRyanFish hypeE
[2022-12-10 16:27:16] <%MrRyanFish> @Ana1661 I personally think if you was to be instadowned you should take an injury and need to mend. but regular M1's doing damage is perfectly fine
[2022-12-10 16:27:22] <%MrRyanFish> @BushiNoKurodo Yoooo
[2022-12-10 16:27:36] <@%Ana1661> @Steffano__ Wait what modCheck
[2022-12-10 16:27:48] <@%Steffano__> otzSmirk it was mainly over the genlocking ana
[2022-12-10 16:27:50] <littlemsjester> @mrryanfish at the same time, people hard tunnel out to force a 3vs1 game which make it a lot harder.
[2022-12-10 16:28:02] <%Kenzou8> ana hensHypers
[2022-12-10 16:28:20] <@%Ana1661> @Steffano__ I must've not heard it I was thinking about pink KEKW
[2022-12-10 16:28:24] <@%Steffano__> i love it when people force a 3v1 but still lose Clueless
[2022-12-10 16:28:29] <%MrRyanFish> @littlemsjester I do think tunnelling and camping shouldn't work as well as it does, but giving an action speed bonus for your team dying isn't it
[2022-12-10 16:28:33] <@%Steffano__> otzSmirk naturally ana
[2022-12-10 16:28:37] <@%Ana1661> @MrRyanFish I think the way they were last year was cool
[2022-12-10 16:29:01] <littlemsjester> @mrryanfish I’d rather that then add more to base kit. I dislike adding perks to basekit because it reduces build variety imo.

[2022-12-10 16:29:14] <%MrRyanFish> @Ana1661 As a new player, losing games to snowmen as I wasn't great in chase was bum.
[2022-12-10 16:29:29] <@%Steffano__> bushi hensCutie
[2022-12-10 16:29:50] <%Yumivers> flickgod333
[2022-12-10 16:29:56] <Martyr01> solid hit Kappa
[2022-12-10 16:30:25] <littlemsjester> On a fun note, I’d love more objectives or places to hide :3 like find Easter eggs on the map to open an alternative escape route or to get a blessing from the entity. But I doubt they’ll add a new game more any time soon
[2022-12-10 16:30:45] <%MrRyanFish> @littlemsjester Yeah basekit perks as a fix isn't it either imo  you need to give killers an insentive to not tunnel, kinda like getting bbq stacks for BP
[2022-12-10 16:30:54] <@%Ana1661> @MrRyanFish I mean it's just an event otzShrug  It added some niche fun mechanics, now it's just doing nothing and no one wants to interact with snowmen which is like, what's the point then
[2022-12-10 16:31:02] <%BushiNoKurodo> @littlemsjester u the cutie  peepoShy
[2022-12-10 16:31:06] <Yaboi__nate> @Yaboi__nate I agree with ana, its better to give something fun for both sides to do than something no one cares, i dont see anyone using the snowmen this year
[2022-12-10 16:31:12] <tornhonor> Is sloppy good on Oni?
[2022-12-10 16:31:22] <%Kenzou8> yo you can shred over the hole on badham
[2022-12-10 16:31:27] <waltonbago> @tornhonor very good
[2022-12-10 16:31:34] <%Kenzou8> so thats pretty cool
[2022-12-10 16:31:38] <@%Ana1661> @Kenzou8 Reaaally
[2022-12-10 16:31:46] <%MrRyanFish> @Ana1661 I mean killers are interacting with snowmen and like all of my games during this event have been filled with snowmen use
[2022-12-10 16:32:08] <%zNard> I mean they just put one present on top of the gen lmao hensGib
[2022-12-10 16:32:25] <%Kenzou8> yea max charge and you stand a bit back
[2022-12-10 16:32:27] <%Kenzou8> you just fly over

[2022-12-10 16:33:38] <%Kenzou8> i got a comment "+rep gave me a heart attack" i was hiding in one next to hook OMEGALUL
[2022-12-10 16:34:02] <Dr_K3tchup> Oni needs a Count Dracula skin, it fits the blood theme so well
[2022-12-10 16:34:27] <%MrRyanFish> @Ana1661 Killers last year had nothing though so its defo an improvement for both sides, also like you said, its an event but you can choose to do it or not, in the end more people seem like they are playing even if they aren't using the snowmen
[2022-12-10 16:34:55] <+goodkisser> Hello my friend
[2022-12-10 16:35:09] <%GENJ1SMOM> @mrryanfish Cause snowmen for survs are absolute useless

[2022-12-10 16:35:28] <@%Ana1661> @Steffano__ I went back to VOD to hear it and Stevie you will never catch me running a trash perk like Overcharge KEKW Unless it's for some stupid archive
[2022-12-10 16:35:36] <@%Steffano__> otzSmirk
[2022-12-10 16:35:48] <%Kenzou8> and thats GG
[2022-12-10 16:36:14] <%Yumivers> cheryl has to have distortion you never seen her on floods
[2022-12-10 16:36:24] <@%Steffano__> imo they should never have buffed overcharge Prayge
[2022-12-10 16:36:43] <%Kenzou8> distortion is goated
[2022-12-10 16:36:47] <redude11> hey
[2022-12-10 16:36:53] <%Kenzou8> wait what
[2022-12-10 16:37:00] <Anglerfish> maybe if you're in the snowman you can't see auras
[2022-12-10 16:37:04] <darkshadowsniperangel> @Steffano__ are you italian or german? that's a very pasta name right there
[2022-12-10 16:37:04] <%killer95k22> prob cause a lot of killers are running No Where To Hide
[2022-12-10 16:37:05] <Cairsoir> Nowhere t Hide common pick, and Lethal is aswell especially on stronger killers
[2022-12-10 16:37:05] <%kiwiane16> hiding in snowmen maybe
[2022-12-10 16:37:09] <crocing> how is everyone doing
[2022-12-10 16:37:09] <Roan_van_Merwijk> Snowman gaming, I guess.
[2022-12-10 16:37:13] <Night_Wolf79x> Yepge
[2022-12-10 16:37:14] <%MrRyanFish> Whispers might actually be a poggers idea for killers with all the anti aura potential
[2022-12-10 16:37:16] <+absurditynohope> I swear when I use Floods there’s always someone I just don’t see even without distortion
[2022-12-10 16:37:18] <@%Steffano__> @darkshadowsniperangel otzSmirk i'm neither, british
[2022-12-10 16:37:19] <Roan_van_Merwijk> @crocing Im good, how ru?
[2022-12-10 16:37:26] <@%Ana1661> @MrRyanFish They should've added what they added for killers and kept it as it was for survivors and it would've been absolutely pog. Imo last year event was the best event they ever made, I was very hyped for this year since I heard the snowmen are coming back and now I'm kinda very disappointed
[2022-12-10 16:37:30] <crocing> im good! ty for asking
[2022-12-10 16:37:38] <Roan_van_Merwijk> @crocing Good to hear.

[2022-12-10 16:38:02] <%GENJ1SMOM> @ana1661 some killers were not playable but I agree last year was more interactive

[2022-12-10 16:38:27] <%MrRyanFish> @Ana1661 Again I don't like how you can instakill through a snowman personally, but getting M1'd is fine imo, means you aren't getting completely nerfed cause of an event

[2022-12-10 17:28:29] <demo_nance> ngl demo isn't that interesting so you didn't miss much
[2022-12-10 17:28:33] <+Legion_doto> @animeangel09 true ahaha

[2022-12-10 17:28:50] <+RezedentSleeper> i bought mine for around $50 and it worked
[2022-12-10 17:28:53] <%+BarelyLive> demo dlc is like £45
[2022-12-10 17:28:55] <@%animeangel09> oh those nea hype shirts KEKW
[2022-12-10 17:28:56] <Demented_Hag> redeamable code? lol
[2022-12-10 17:28:59] <%GENJ1SMOM> The best way is to find smb who has it and use family share
[2022-12-10 17:29:10] <ttvblackyhd> @RezedentSleeper website?
[2022-12-10 17:29:17] <@%animeangel09> @Demented_Hag yea gives you a dlc key but theyre overpriced and alot of scams out there
[2022-12-10 17:29:18] <!%Squish369_> NoNo
[2022-12-10 17:29:18] <%+BarelyLive> Yeah around £2k
[2022-12-10 17:29:25] <%+BarelyLive> I've seen it around that much
[2022-12-10 17:29:37] <%+NightWing2446> ain't no way 2k for a shirt Kappa
[2022-12-10 17:29:38] <%Kenzou8> there are no shirts left on market thats why its very expensive
[2022-12-10 17:29:39] <%+Ellamin> If I wanted to get scammed i'd buy lottery tickets
[2022-12-10 17:29:45] <Jame________> There’s a bug with demo where you teleport with a survivor you’re carrying
[2022-12-10 17:30:04] <%Kenzou8> xD
[2022-12-10 17:30:04] <%+didyouknowistream> morning hens!
[2022-12-10 17:30:11] <%Kenzou8> its mental
[2022-12-10 17:30:12] <ObsidianLiger> I would NEVER spend 2k on an ingame cosmetic that could get taken away for literally 0 reason other than "we just felt to"
[2022-12-10 17:30:17] <+RezedentSleeper> not just demo its the whole stranger things dlc so steve and nancy
[2022-12-10 17:30:21] <%helllcate_> i saw someone trying to sell a 100k BP code for 100$ on ebay the other day
[2022-12-10 17:30:22] <@%animeangel09> like im obsessed with cosmetics and i wouldnt buy that shirt KEKW thats insanity
[2022-12-10 17:30:28] <@%evidentlyfishy> ^
[2022-12-10 17:30:28] <waltonbago> Hype neas built diff
[2022-12-10 17:30:28] <@%^Nightbot> ^
[2022-12-10 17:30:36] <%Kenzou8> bloodletter dwight cost around 1k aswell
[2022-12-10 17:30:51] <demo_nance> @rezedentsleeper they're just skins tho and you can't get skins for them so you're stuck with the default fits
[2022-12-10 17:31:10] <+RezedentSleeper> @demo_nance i only got the dlc for demo anyway
[2022-12-10 17:31:23] <%+didyouknowistream> would be cool if they brought back the stranger things dlc as a Christmas gift to the players (won't happen but I can dream)

[2022-12-10 17:37:37] <+vicentec17> @acenaaa in my opinion you should play him without engravings for a while until you start to understand how curving feels, then start using engravings so you get the muscle memory

[2022-12-10 19:14:52] <+Trizzle56> if fun was that important wouldn't there be "fun streaks" instead of win streaks?
[2022-12-10 19:15:00] <jonahzx> Myers still powerful
[2022-12-10 19:15:05] <%+globo12343> Wait is this sarcasm? @grownsphere KEKW
[2022-12-10 19:15:05] <M1sticTV> I love the streak wins, i always learn just by watching you guys play
[2022-12-10 19:15:23] <sosadheart> if people know about you maybe go full sweaty builds?
[2022-12-10 19:15:27] <sam_vilderness> @trizzle56 u dont need to have skill to have fun bruh u need to skill to win
[2022-12-10 19:15:39] <grownsphere> @globo12343 no cuz keys are useless tbh
[2022-12-10 19:15:49] <sam_vilderness> i dunno if thats bait or not but i took it NotLikeThis
[2022-12-10 19:15:55] <jonahzx> I hate playing against pin head
[2022-12-10 19:16:02] <%GENJ1SMOM> @grownsphere no they are actually strong but nobody uses them
[2022-12-10 19:16:12] <%+globo12343> @grownsphere wait when you said 0 gens, do you mean hatch should spawn at 0 gens?
[2022-12-10 19:16:18] <%+globo12343> @grownsphere how long have you played the game for?
[2022-12-10 19:16:19] <%GENJ1SMOM> @globo12343 If 0 gens are left
[2022-12-10 19:16:20] <+Trizzle56> need more luck than skill imo

[2022-12-10 19:16:31] <DariusFinn> Hens have you made a snowman high five line yet?
[2022-12-10 19:16:36] <sam_vilderness> @trizzle56 what a win streak ?
[2022-12-10 19:16:48] <+Trizzle56> @sam_vilderness yes
[2022-12-10 19:16:53] <+DaveWilsea> The new videos have been excellent, really engaging stuff
[2022-12-10 19:16:55] <grownsphere> @globo12343 when u do all the gens hatch should spawn
[2022-12-10 19:17:12] <sam_vilderness> u think they got to 219 wins cauze they got lucky ?
[2022-12-10 19:17:12] <TooninatorPlayz> it doesnt
[2022-12-10 19:17:12] <@%Ana1661> Hens content always W content
[2022-12-10 19:17:31] <TooninatorPlayz> hatch only spawns when everyone but one survivor is dead
[2022-12-10 19:17:32] <%+globo12343> @grownsphere cause before the hatch nerf, it used to work like that. Or it would be if there was 2 survs, 3 gens would need to be done I think and hatch would spawn
[2022-12-10 19:17:32] <sam_vilderness> bruh
[2022-12-10 19:17:48] <%+globo12343> But ppl abused it so much, they had to nerf it @grownsphere
[2022-12-10 19:17:51] <+Trizzle56> @sam_vilderness 60% luck, 40% slill
[2022-12-10 19:17:54] <+Trizzle56> skill
[2022-12-10 19:18:10] <sam_vilderness> there is no point in arguing @trizzle56 have a nice day

[2022-12-10 19:18:40] <+Trizzle56> chill
[2022-12-10 19:18:46] <@%Ana1661> @globo12343 The hatch spawn rules were so weird. You could get the hatch spawn when 4 survivors were alive but I don't remember the rules
[2022-12-10 19:19:14] <@%Ana1661> @Trizzle56 Don't be rude to people please Prayge
[2022-12-10 19:19:20] <TooninatorPlayz> you had to do 4 gens for hatch to spawn with 4 people I think
[2022-12-10 19:19:20] DELETED: Trizzle56 (@sam_vilderness lol wut, u have issues bro, cbill)
[2022-12-10 19:19:29] <%the_nulll> if you did the 3 gen knight strat in customs against bots, would the game shut down in an hour?
[2022-12-10 19:19:30] <grownsphere> @globo12343 ye remember that but know the hatch could counter endgame builds and it wouldn't be so op like before
[2022-12-10 19:19:46] <%GENJ1SMOM> @globo12343 If gens left+survs remaining=4 hatch spawns
[2022-12-10 19:20:04] <%+foxtheunicorn> @globo12343 4 Survivors at 1 gen 3 survs at 2 2 survs at 3 gens
[2022-12-10 19:20:22] <%+globo12343> @sam_vilderness i wouldn’t consider it luck, but it’s more like rng ig. But for sure you def need skill to win ofc

[2022-12-10 19:39:01] <+AtomikTraveler> You don't even need insidious on bubba right now, you can just hide in a snowman instead.

[2022-12-10 19:41:12] <@%Ana1661> @ObsidianLiger Also idk I'm not talking about addons I'm talking in general, like with Nurse you need to be more mechanically accurate and personally for me it's harder to learn than to learn how to be attentive to sounds and their types
