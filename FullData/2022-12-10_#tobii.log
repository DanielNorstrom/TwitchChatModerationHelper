[2022-12-10 01:51:21] <%+infectious37> she could use a judge.
[2022-12-10 01:51:22] <funnybone_> its just ethically wrong
[2022-12-10 01:51:23] <%+salmon_rl> going outside the lines just to get to the finish isnt right
[2022-12-10 01:51:24] <%davohellfire> yeah is it corrupt if she actually finds out something others couldnt
[2022-12-10 01:51:24] <+HallJams> depends on the motive
[2022-12-10 01:51:24] <%+sreylas> but no cocent
[2022-12-10 01:51:24] <kcowpie> its only "corrupt" because its illegal, even if its a good thing shes trying to do
[2022-12-10 01:51:25] <%MrInquisitor> exhuming a body without a warrant... yes... thats corpse tampering/body mutilation
[2022-12-10 01:51:25] <YuraDarklight> legally she has no pc, therefore it's corrupt, but morally it's a good decision to have doubts
[2022-12-10 01:51:26] <%sunflowerkissed> oooh - the classic question: do the ends justify the means?
[2022-12-10 01:51:26] <hellmaker77> yeah it is corrupt cause its not lawfull procedure
[2022-12-10 01:51:27] <%Baconstrips95> I mean shes backing up pred which is crim
[2022-12-10 01:51:27] <VivaHoodoo> Its gonna be interesting to find out how and who she shares the info with
[2022-12-10 01:51:28] <SaltCreation> end justify the means
[2022-12-10 01:51:32] <%Sssaap> a good reason yes, but taking a shortcut :D
[2022-12-10 01:51:32] <+Ronsith> sometimes you gotta crack a few eggs to get to the bad guy
[2022-12-10 01:51:33] <%+ky05uk3> the grave digging is probably criminal if they're going off duty to do it
[2022-12-10 01:51:36] <+KrazyWizardFox> ziggyjSip ziggyjSip ziggyjSip
[2022-12-10 01:51:37] <+darksun_hd> I mean based on allucinations is pretty much corrupt
[2022-12-10 01:51:39] <%+CuppaT_XYZ> it’s corruption whether the moral reason are just
[2022-12-10 01:51:39] <+2dex4u> I mean MS got blown up tho so there shouldnt be a corpse in the grave
[2022-12-10 01:51:39] <%+TenthGlobe> seems like a case of asking for forgiveness not permission
[2022-12-10 01:51:41] <%Hekawolf> criminal isn't corrupt... though she's doing it for herself as well
[2022-12-10 01:51:44] <%Cyanea> it's illegal but maybe not morally wrong
[2022-12-10 01:51:50] <+ShakyMclovin361> tobiiiLurk tobiiiLurk
[2022-12-10 01:51:53] <%+sreylas> without court order it's grave robbing
[2022-12-10 01:51:56] <%evilmogwai> is graverobbing an actual charge
[2022-12-10 01:52:01] <%+CuppaT_XYZ> she reading chat Susge
[2022-12-10 01:52:01] <hellmaker77> @Baconstrips95 She already told on pred, people are just not pushing it
[2022-12-10 01:52:06] <%davohellfire> ms - do it jenny. find your truth
[2022-12-10 01:52:09] <%+RodaLaxen> i think it is
[2022-12-10 01:52:11] <%bobmkz> @Siggwulf Thanks for the gift sub!
[2022-12-10 01:52:13] <%Cyanea> desecration of a human corpse is a charge
[2022-12-10 01:52:16] <Thorn104> i dont think it is in the city....
[2022-12-10 01:52:16] <%bluewhatev> Also, it's disturbing the chain of command of the evidence so it should legally invalidate any evidence that will ever come off the body.
[2022-12-10 01:52:17] <%+ghost3k> it godda be
[2022-12-10 01:52:22] <+Kudasauce> messing with dead people is I think
[2022-12-10 01:52:22] <%Explorer_ini> desrecration is
[2022-12-10 01:52:22] <%+TheGingerSammy> Do it, Jenny tobiiiCult
[2022-12-10 01:52:22] <KingMcNastyy> Possession of Human remains definitely is if grave robbing is
[2022-12-10 01:52:22] <DrBeaubert> just desecration I think
[2022-12-10 01:52:22] <%Cody_Ross> Possession of human remains..
[2022-12-10 01:52:23] <%chopono> i think is forcers law
[2022-12-10 01:52:23] <%+ky05uk3> probably desecration of a corpse which I think is a charge?
[2022-12-10 01:52:23] <SteveNeato> Stealing bodies from the morgue I know is a charge in nopixel
[2022-12-10 01:52:24] <%+VoidedZReaper> there is "desecration of a human corpse"
[2022-12-10 01:52:27] <KingMcNastyy> isnt*

[2022-12-10 01:58:12] <HanamiAkuma> you could put the prop skeletons that were in parsons too

[2022-12-10 01:58:22] <KingMcNastyy> Skin, Hair pieces, Fingernails (maybe) and bones is all I think would remain

[2022-12-10 01:58:25] <%xoSerenity> @Explorer_ini thought so.
[2022-12-10 01:58:26] <%+MackieUK> what if they get there and the grave is already dug up
[2022-12-10 01:58:27] <%+csacdfw> Sample of bone probably wouldn’t have infusion DNA in it
[2022-12-10 01:58:34] <%+blacksmith1095> at this point the body would be liquid and the bones would be there, to be honest the padding in a coffin is designed to soak up the liquid

[2022-12-10 09:09:05] <PeinSamaCZe> the crims would have to check before going to tunnels, so that would bring less chances There, which should be good
