[2023-01-02 16:48:19] <%+xPOG4LIFEx> Did I hear they're changing combat???

[2023-01-02 16:48:38] <DonjaZero> They promised a core server code rewrite that would fix performance, but haven't heard any update on that.
[2023-01-02 16:49:43] <%TaintMcGee__1516> The last one! But this one is a banger too

[2023-01-02 17:45:04] <%MyNamesElias> @Deltiasgaming You should know there has been some datamining that pretty much confirms the chapter location too.

[2023-01-02 17:59:43] <+iXEvenex> oh yea, the world v world PvP is great... its action combat, most skills dont have a CD... depending on ur class/profession. small scaling, or zergling is 100% viable. 1vXing is a thing, like the ESO 1vXing, but its more skill based imo... rather than who has the better ping

[2023-01-02 18:25:32] <%MyNamesElias> Spellcrafting was shown off at quakecon 2014. It was later datamined too. But as far as i know there hasn't been any spellcrafting related datamining since
[2023-01-02 18:25:46] <ArwenSelora> hmmmm

[2023-01-02 21:03:46] <!%its_sardiner> When you deal damage with a melee Heavy Attack, you spew a cone of corruption, dealing 1492 Disease damage to enemies over 4 seconds. This damage is increased by 10% for each negative effect the enemies have, up to a maximum of 300%. This effect can occur once every 10 seconds and scales off the higher of your Weapon or Spell Damage.

[2023-01-02 21:17:51] <+sidddward> they should add a 5th slot to the champion bars
[2023-01-02 21:17:52] <!%its_sardiner> There is some utility according ot original plans.  As it had alteration, conjuration magic.
[2023-01-02 21:17:56] <@%$arctic_bombsicle> I think Spellcrafting is going to be an alternative to pots and food
[2023-01-02 21:18:53] <%linifox> @arctic_bombsicle that would be good if they did spell crafting idk if it should replace consumables but who cares at this point with that consumables arent fun in eso
[2023-01-02 21:18:56] <%linifox> Just mandatory
[2023-01-02 21:19:12] <!%its_sardiner> I would be happy if they gave a 5th slot just to the thief cp.  It would be nice ot have a fast mount, farm, AND fish.
