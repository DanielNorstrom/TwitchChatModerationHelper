[2022-12-28 08:21:46] <altruvice> @fromisdkdk you generally save the card packs for the last few cards of the set

[2022-12-28 08:22:49] <@%+Shikiro> If you are impatient and want to feel that damage boost, 2 selection packs used for los18 isn’t that bad

[2022-12-28 08:23:50] <@%+Shikiro> Also depends on how many legendary selection packs you’ve gotten from challenge abyss
[2022-12-28 08:23:51] <wydstepbro_chris> i love u
[2022-12-28 08:24:10] <@%+Shikiro> It’s a lot easier to use 2 selectors when you have like 12 of them
[2022-12-28 08:24:20] <Asmii> I used a selection pack for my last los 18 that I bought won for 2k on
[2022-12-28 08:24:24] <Asmii> and I still felt guilty doing it
[2022-12-28 08:24:55] <@%+Shikiro> But if you are at like 6 selectors, I’d say no
[2022-12-28 08:24:59] <geosun> was there a rollback on the kr servers today?

[2022-12-28 09:14:03] <ashius_aurelius> Is this RE DB?
[2022-12-28 09:14:11] <altruvice> also depends how far you wanna take those alts
[2022-12-28 09:14:12] <%+the_pikahu> if you cut a 7/6 stone with 12 grudge, you can gear 4x3+2 with two legendary class accessories
[2022-12-28 09:14:19] <+Furryuri> If ur gonna keep ur alts like 1460 legendary can be ok but if ur pushing past that I’d say 5x3

[2022-12-28 10:02:07] <ozzzzeey> skip means just miss the continent , dont unlock dungeons and special quests that are required in progression @greyxx_
[2022-12-28 10:02:19] <+greyxx_> @ozzzzeey completely skip, idk if it still works with all the changes but when u get the ilvl u can sail towards the next continent
[2022-12-28 10:02:40] <+greyxx_> @ozzzzeey oh i dont advise this on a new player's main, but only if its for an alt
[2022-12-28 10:02:54] <ozzzzeey> u can knowledge transfer , skipping is not good

[2022-12-28 13:21:06] <KuSoraa> @PrimeBG preference, only around 3% dmg difference
[2022-12-28 13:21:08] <ilkeidz> @PrimeBG salvation is atkspeed and moove speed

[2022-12-28 13:21:42] <KuSoraa> depends on your stats disturbution too, if u go crit spec it is preferred u go salvation to get atk speed
[2022-12-28 13:21:44] <%PrimeBG> @ilkeidz salvation doesnt give movement speed i dont think
[2022-12-28 13:21:55] <%cchrispy2k> THESE

[2022-12-28 13:26:07] <Kyodou> that
[2022-12-28 13:26:15] <%noyze15> if pm3 than srf if pm1 br
[2022-12-28 13:26:16] <Kyodou> that's preference too
[2022-12-28 13:26:22] <%kyats> @kyats yep
[2022-12-28 13:26:25] <%kyats> still doing it
[2022-12-28 13:27:27] <KuSoraa> u have alot of animation locks as gs, for me BR is way better than SRF because u can move while you're shooting and deal decent-good filler dmg
[2022-12-28 13:27:31] <+beneaththerailway> but do you go swift or spec

[2022-12-28 13:28:34] <Kalleskavjar> @beneaththerailway you can go spec with salvation set, feels just as nice

[2022-12-28 13:28:46] <%AyeJSuave> @xuazera yes
[2022-12-28 13:28:54] <ilkeidz> 1 ring swift is fine to have but if u wanna balls deep dps then full spec
[2022-12-28 13:29:01] <KuSoraa> @beneaththerailway feels nice sure, dmg is meh, i suggest going crit spec with poem of salvation, finding a swift spec or swift crit bracelet and you're all set

[2022-12-28 13:32:33] <Scardude> @xuazera RE is fine, just tell all ppl that flex with surge, that they're sub humans.

[2022-12-28 13:33:45] <%AyeJSuave> @AntipainK surge is not harder you just need to learn the bosses pattern to land your surge thats the hard part
[2022-12-28 13:33:54] <ilkeidz> @AntipainK harder where? just knowing raid knowledge toi get 20 stacks and  hit the surge?
[2022-12-28 13:34:05] <gionnisins> @HaoKanOvO    completely agree i have a surge blade too
[2022-12-28 13:34:12] <ilkeidz> @AntipainK agree wqith u @AyeJSuave
[2022-12-28 13:34:26] <%AyeJSuave> @xuazera no if you get MVP you clearly know the bosses pattern
[2022-12-28 13:34:28] <10Kyro> Surge is more punishing though, that's for sure
[2022-12-28 13:34:31] <+AntipainK> Sure. All the things you mentioned make Surge harder than RE
[2022-12-28 13:34:33] <+Sallverrhino> In what way is RE harder than Surge though?
[2022-12-28 13:34:49] <%AyeJSuave> @xuazera stop it , youre spreading misinformation
[2022-12-28 13:34:54] <HaoKanOvO> I'm sorry but you don't even need to know patterns to land the surge BA LUL
[2022-12-28 13:35:12] <obelixOO7> @Sallverrhino you need a lot better uptime to compete
[2022-12-28 13:35:20] <ilkeidz> @AntipainK well no because u learn raid once u do it couple time  but re is harder cuz u need to hit all back attacks for it to be as good
[2022-12-28 13:35:26] <HaoKanOvO> Plenty of stack gaining skills BA is irrelevant too
[2022-12-28 13:35:28] <yunyunku> KEKW
[2022-12-28 13:35:31] <+Pizza4Free97_> Re is harder because you need 100% uptime on back attack to do less damage

[2022-12-28 18:55:40] <Shaileyeu> surge db sucks when you are group with juiced dps too because when you obtain the x20 stack boss goes already on mech haha
[2022-12-28 18:55:44] <@%+Shikiro> Actually RE damage is really good, it's just that you need to hit back attacks all the time. Surge is focusing to hit the back at a focused time.
[2022-12-28 18:56:12] <wolder1305> is that a pistoleer or enhanced weap?
