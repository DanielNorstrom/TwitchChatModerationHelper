[2022-12-08 08:36:46] <naif0708> this is my second day keep searching for a game is this possible ?
[2022-12-08 08:36:54] <+Pyro_Is_Shy> Maybe don't inform your opponent of your one strategy before you try and do it

[2022-12-08 08:40:48] <TylerTy21> yeah boxy even fished for fish he didnt need
[2022-12-08 08:40:51] <+Ukillmelongtime> yep and boxy had a win and if he quit he loses streak and that guy would get his flag so he was not going to let that happen
[2022-12-08 08:40:56] <bennycoollol> PizzaTime
[2022-12-08 08:41:06] <%Angel_Darkchylde> Yeah that 3 hour chase was just ridiculous. Loved that Boxy even started fishing while waiting for the player.

[2022-12-08 08:46:23] <+Pyro_Is_Shy> Getting lucky is faster than 30+ minute fights that you have to supply for each
[2022-12-08 08:46:37] <%Bladowski> did you manage to hit 100 yesterday? saw you were close before i had to go
[2022-12-08 08:46:38] <+plankyboi> i made a ship called parlay and gamble a surprising amount of people are down to gamble
[2022-12-08 08:46:42] <Captain_Ambrossa> @Pyro_Is_Shy I love it because its funny and takes away the stress factor, because you dont care about supplies since you just respawn and go ram again
[2022-12-08 08:46:46] <calum1019> Yes solo
[2022-12-08 08:46:49] <Ollyyyyy123> I'm off to work beard. Have a good one <3

[2022-12-08 08:49:15] <+Pyro_Is_Shy> I don't purely ram strat, but I do begin sessions by ramming and then stealing all their good food lol
[2022-12-08 08:49:32] <%LordKnivex> that's why skilled plays don't call it running. they call it a tactical retreat LUL

[2022-12-08 08:52:59] <+IanG85> @mikefitekr everything has the honeymoon period, and it always ends ;)
[2022-12-08 08:53:19] <+Pyro_Is_Shy> how
[2022-12-08 08:53:21] <%Bladowski> lol consistant
[2022-12-08 08:53:23] <%+Slipknot140488> what a sniper blunder :))
[2022-12-08 08:53:33] <%+kettlehatxlr> people will use this for getting athena level 5 instead of doing veil voyages
[2022-12-08 08:53:33] <korkoor123> dont u like dubbel gunning?
[2022-12-08 08:53:36] <AaronAdventurer> that was bullshit
[2022-12-08 08:53:37] <%mikescloud0> Isn‚Äôt there a new adventure today?
[2022-12-08 08:53:45] <%mikefitekr> @mikefitekr tre true
[2022-12-08 08:53:58] <+IanG85> @mikescloud0 wait what day is it?  lol if thursday yes lol
[2022-12-08 08:54:09] <bazzinga22044> yooo wassup
[2022-12-08 08:54:12] <%+Nightfire255> Good morning Beard and chat!
[2022-12-08 08:54:14] <%+hellkith> @korkoor123 he misses 50% of his shots with 1 gun.. so he'll miss 100% of his shots with 2 guns
[2022-12-08 08:54:14] <Dontslamcoke> naval combat the best part imo
[2022-12-08 08:54:15] <$gingerunit8> I can‚Äôt imagine going back to adventure, me personally I loved arena and PvP. This new update is awesome but I get those that prefer adventure mode. It‚Äôs not for everyone
[2022-12-08 08:54:20] <+Pyro_Is_Shy> They should add hand cannons so that beard can Naval on land

[2022-12-08 08:54:31] <cesob> But Beard...I sink everytime I play the PVP! If I won everytime I would play it more...it's not fair!
[2022-12-08 08:54:57] <+Soso_lachtibretonne> Hello Beard! hope you are doing well ‚ò∫Ô∏è
[2022-12-08 08:55:01] <captain_reign> you get little rep each time you sink anyway
[2022-12-08 08:55:05] <%+thom_the_bard> @Nightfire255 barbHi barbHi barbHi
[2022-12-08 08:55:14] <korkoor123> @cesob that happen to everyone. Keep doing it and you will get better!
[2022-12-08 08:55:19] <%+kettlehatxlr> i'm so used to cutlass if rare decides to remove it, i wouldn't win a single fight
[2022-12-08 08:55:20] <%+Nightfire255> I love the new pvp mode. It's so much more satisfying fighting in the pvp mode than spending an hour chasing people in adventure that don't want to pvp.
[2022-12-08 08:56:01] <+Decado32> i enjoy all the non naval stuff, but can get similar in any rpg. This is sea of thieves, not island of thieves - gotta shoot cannons at things
[2022-12-08 08:56:10] <+Pyro_Is_Shy> You won't need any cannonballs if you give Ram Strat Man a taste of his own medicine /s

[2022-12-08 08:59:13] <!CoffeeWithKyle> Hello Beard and Chat
[2022-12-08 08:59:27] <+Pyro_Is_Shy> a little disrespectful to the pirate lord to not use his gift
[2022-12-08 08:59:35] <%oldtimeyhockey> sink 1 get sunk 1000
[2022-12-08 08:59:39] <%eSwizy> use curse till you get commendations tho
[2022-12-08 08:59:50] <Rectifeye> Yeah. I have heard all kinds of numbers.
[2022-12-08 08:59:58] <$cats_are_a_conspiracy> I am still trying to get my 10 sink streak so I keep losing my hourglass value. but it's not about the gold or reputation........ it's about the commendations ü§£ü§£ü§£

[2022-12-08 09:00:38] <chessvolt74> I think the best way to do pvp, is when u have 30 min after quests
[2022-12-08 09:00:39] <%+hellkith> the only way I'll ever get the 10 streak is when someone invites me onto a 9 streak ship and we get the 10th one xD
[2022-12-08 09:00:59] <$MsKnightFox> I think they'll fix it

[2022-12-08 09:23:35] <ElectricKnight> I completely get it. I never noticed the sound with the ghost curse. The skelly curse is definitely something to get used to.
[2022-12-08 09:23:49] <+IanG85> kinda like when i turn my socks around, used to just do it without thinking now everytime i move my socks i think of Beard.. kinda weird if you ask me lol

[2022-12-08 09:33:11] <%+CiriTheEvilMeowMeow> @Tharrilicious I always repair before launching a server with my ship; but I see many people, streamers included, not repairing. I've always wondered if it was to flex or if it's really not that useful LUL

[2022-12-08 09:34:38] <Coraoke> is there a patch?
[2022-12-08 09:34:45] <TwiZtiDJaY> I think servers don't go down when adventures start anymore. I think they only go down when they take the adventures down.
[2022-12-08 09:34:45] <@%MsThorns> It's a mystery.
[2022-12-08 09:34:51] <%Craig_Grim> Yup RARE and definitely trolling with Larinna
[2022-12-08 09:34:53] <%LordKnivex> larinna is a secret top tier servant of the flame.  that's my prediction
[2022-12-08 09:34:56] <Coraoke> ah cool

[2022-12-08 09:35:33] <TwiZtiDJaY> My guess is prolly not since they haven't mentioned anything.
[2022-12-08 09:35:38] <%+CiriTheEvilMeowMeow> ngl seeing a random whisper at the entrance of a tavern is funny
[2022-12-08 09:35:45] <@%MsThorns> The fact that they haven't said anything is scaring me LUL
[2022-12-08 09:35:48] <%+hellkith> I guess you could say it's rare that the servers not go down for adventures Kappa

[2022-12-08 09:46:40] <%+CiriTheEvilMeowMeow> @Mr_Kr0sis best way to try getting out of there is to snipe the other dude or fire back; keep pressure while bucket your own ship

[2022-12-08 09:46:50] <Ingwulf> The fights can be super long if both know what they are doing ans have enough supplies

[2022-12-08 09:59:26] <$cats_are_a_conspiracy> I ran into an alliance server while solo. this issue for them is they were ill practiced in PvP so when I sunk them all they all screamed at me and threatened to report me. like what? they voted for PvP with the hourglass so it's all fair game as far as I am concerned
[2022-12-08 09:59:31] <%+CiriTheEvilMeowMeow> We accidentally did alliance server trying to multi-ship. Instead of getting 2 brigs; we got 3; and then the other people in server gave us their ship; because with that many fire power; they didn't want to try it LUL
[2022-12-08 09:59:31] <NickFromPlanetEarth> I mean they could just add that you cant use the hourglass while in  an alliance no?
[2022-12-08 09:59:34] <%acmlex> i still sink people that are running emissaries hehe :D
[2022-12-08 09:59:37] <Ironside8516> are they doing it because they actually want pvp now or because they are trying to cheese the curse
[2022-12-08 09:59:37] <quackiechan420> morning beard, will there servers go down today for the new adventure or is it just going to carry on?
[2022-12-08 09:59:37] <xQwc> They can limit the alliance to 3 ships maximum

[2022-12-08 09:59:43] <Ckay> Tbf I have seen other alliance servers are not doing it as they say it's against ToS. So props to them I guess

[2022-12-08 10:01:04] <%+hellkith> Also I think the scam still needs to be paid out :P
[2022-12-08 10:01:09] <%+kettlehatxlr> i don't care about alliance servers tbh it's not a mmorpg after all but if they cause us to have less players in adventure servers it's a problem

[2022-12-08 10:01:13] <Mudl123> alliance should be part of the bigger ship pool. so only people that want it get matched
[2022-12-08 10:01:25] <Ironside8516> well it would be nice to choose between the two when our wants change
[2022-12-08 10:01:25] <+IanG85> does the matchmaker have to find you an enemy on a server that has space, or will it throw a 6th ship in that server knowing the loser is merged ?
[2022-12-08 10:01:25] <adien42> glitter beard would be a issue if the only allowed 3 ship allys
[2022-12-08 10:01:26] <%mikescloud0> Ur office is well heated??
[2022-12-08 10:01:29] <braindeadbuddha> the mixture of the two is what makes me love the game so much. can't imagine wanting one and not the other.
[2022-12-08 10:01:34] <%Vupzy23> It‚Äôs the constant threat on the horizon is honestly what makes PVE more enjoyable for me.
[2022-12-08 10:01:34] <+dibreno> I think that if pve servers were ever a thing it should be paid pve private servers. Separate from the game as a whole
[2022-12-08 10:01:40] <AaronAdventurer> It‚Äôs like taking the pvp out of gta5. It‚Äôll become boring af
[2022-12-08 10:01:40] <%Succubuzz> Vupzy23 last time i saw anything from them, they made it clear that they dont want their members doing the Hourglass at all
[2022-12-08 10:01:59] <TWO_DEEEE> if there were pve only servers, normal servers would die and all the fun pvp encounters would die
[2022-12-08 10:02:03] <NickFromPlanetEarth> any proposal for how to stop it beard?

[2022-12-08 10:02:46] <%+Twilight79> on community day i love a good alliance server lol
[2022-12-08 10:03:08] <@%^Nightbot> Fancy yourself a hat or a T-shirt? üß¢  Check out Beard's merch shop here: https://www.shopbeardageddon.com
[2022-12-08 10:03:10] <Ckay> I mean they try sugar coat it as wanting PvE servers. Really they just want an easy way to get gold and cosmetics. And so now they want to do PvP as it's the new thing to grind
[2022-12-08 10:03:24] <%Vupzy23> I don‚Äôt mind organic alliance servers, I hate forced alliance servers, I‚Äôm sure you know how people get a server for themselves already

[2022-12-08 10:04:35] <Ironside8516> it bothers me soooo much lol
[2022-12-08 10:04:43] <braindeadbuddha> yep exactly
[2022-12-08 10:05:02] <+dibreno> I disagree. People said that about the player base for years on RuneScape being a good example. Their are a shit ton of private servers but the main game is still plenty populated
[2022-12-08 10:05:05] <NickFromPlanetEarth> gets crapped on while a crew tells him to "git gud lul"
[2022-12-08 10:05:13] <%Vupzy23> I understand it. 100%
[2022-12-08 10:05:14] <bobbybisto1> ive noticed most people dont want to fight they run
[2022-12-08 10:05:18] <%BadBobier> dejavu
[2022-12-08 10:05:25] <AaronAdventurer> Did you know a platypus is the only mammals to lie eggs and produce milk in there ‚Äúskin flaps‚Äù
[2022-12-08 10:05:33] <%+Falkentavio> The playerbase would just change. It would shrink, for sure, but the game without PvP would still be a unique adventure multiplayer with a great narative, great story telling and lot's of grinds to be done. And lot of people would play it who are not gonna play this game with PvP.
[2022-12-08 10:05:46] <gspossum> @bobbybisto1 hopefully they release an update for pvp where you can dive underwater and find a fight.
[2022-12-08 10:05:47] <%Vupzy23> I got more time to spare than the average adult, I work and play SoT, I‚Äôm single and have no kids.
[2022-12-08 10:05:49] <+dibreno> I think alliance servers ruin sea of thieves
[2022-12-08 10:05:49] <xmerkulezx> its all fked
[2022-12-08 10:05:49] <ElectricKnight> Honestly, some people just do not enjoy pvp on any level. They can never play this game, but, if it wouldn't ruin this game, private servers could allow them to enjoy everything else the game has.
[2022-12-08 10:06:01] <%p3rfect_death> they would be a nice way to  just grind if you were tryin to chill. but pvp is so much fun
[2022-12-08 10:06:07] <+pezzychaos> After getting spawn camped to oblivion, verbally abused and racially harassed, I can honestly say I‚Äôve never gotten bored of an alliance server. And I don‚Äôt yearn for PvE ever again.
[2022-12-08 10:06:15] <GORILLAKRUNCH> not a huge player base for the game.
[2022-12-08 10:06:16] <TWO_DEEEE> @dibreno on those private servers can you join a normal server and still have all your stuff? i dont think you can, thats why it didnt kill the player base
[2022-12-08 10:06:33] VIEWERS: 644
[2022-12-08 10:06:37] <TwiZtiDJaY> I think without thr risk of pvp just kills the game for me. If it was PVE servers they would do everything and just move to the next game. The pvp aspect and meeting people is what keeps the game feeling alive to me.
[2022-12-08 10:06:52] <%+MrNMrsPablo> Well beard I found yesterday am going to be a granny LUL LUL
[2022-12-08 10:06:57] <ElectricKnight> I've played since beta, and I personally wouldn't mind private servers with ull progression - so long as it didn't destroy the live servers. It's debatable. I don't think earning gold or cosmetics or anything really matter. But that's just me.

[2022-12-08 10:07:04] <%+hellkith> I take it as part of the game.. it pisses me off to no end getting completely destroyed all the f'ing time. I'm still playing SoT and hoping one day I get to turn the tables on them
[2022-12-08 10:07:19] <%+MrNMrsPablo> @bunny_vib  thank you
[2022-12-08 10:07:21] <+dibreno> I‚Äôm a pve advocate and I think that alliance servers have given me more grief then any pvp player real talk
[2022-12-08 10:07:22] <%+Falkentavio> That beeing said, Rare has no intent to change the game to PvE only or implement PvEE only servers. They did the right choice with session 8, taking a lot of PvP pressure of of PvE players by giving PvP-onlys a matchmaking to sweat
[2022-12-08 10:07:30] <braindeadbuddha> Are you going for 1000 allegiance???!
[2022-12-08 10:07:32] <%Vupzy23> I believe a lot of people think there‚Äôs a big gap of PVE players Vs PvP players. Because that‚Äôs what it seems over the media, but the average player plays both and enjoys both. But you don‚Äôt see them on media complaining, they just enjoy the game.
[2022-12-08 10:07:34] <%+fhets420> @mrnmrspablo CONGRATULATIONS üéâüéâüéâ

[2022-12-08 10:08:58] <%+MrNMrsPablo> Alliance server in my eyes is an exploit
[2022-12-08 10:09:00] <+vercingetorxone> imo the ppl that "dont like pvp" are not good at it
[2022-12-08 10:09:00] <%Vupzy23> I just don‚Äôt like how I heard some people went into alliance servers and got banned by rare support.

[2022-12-08 10:09:27] <ElectricKnight> To be fair, the only alliance servers I've ever known of, are run by players that pvp on regular servers.
[2022-12-08 10:09:27] <vlsurreallv> i only like slooping
[2022-12-08 10:09:32] <+dibreno> I will say that alliance servers are almost always fucking toxic beard.. they just ruin the spirit of the game

[2022-12-08 10:09:56] <Mr_Kr0sis> i wish i could run into galleons more often, boarding a galleon is so much fun
[2022-12-08 10:09:58] <ElectricKnight> A LOT of my heavy PvP friends and crewmates hop on alliance servers to grind commendations. Which I always thought was nuts, but I guess that's their choice.

[2022-12-08 10:11:01] <+pezzychaos> @dibreno on the flip side I‚Äôve loved my time on alliance servers. The crappy grief I‚Äôve had on PvP is just annoying. I wanna enjoy the time I have. Not get grief for playing a video game. Im decent at pvp but just don‚Äôt vibe it.

[2022-12-08 10:11:22] <+dibreno> Honestly.. getting spawn camper is just an unfortunate part of a good game I think
[2022-12-08 10:11:26] <Furiousity84> Player 3 has entered the battle
[2022-12-08 10:11:27] <%Vupzy23> Spawn camping shouldn‚Äôt be bannable, I think leaving the game and even scuttling is more than enough of a better option than having someone banned. I always get scared of taking supplies from others bc of it

[2022-12-08 10:11:34] <ChrisRaven13> i had a situation like that like that asked for my boat and when i said they could have it when i was done with the tall tale they spawn camped me so i gave my ship to an NAL friend and they shit on the whole alliance
[2022-12-08 10:11:34] <%+CiriTheEvilMeowMeow> waa
[2022-12-08 10:11:37] <%+Teecay> They dont have ally flags
[2022-12-08 10:11:42] <DarkKraken69> If I see that its an alliance attacking me, I'll skuttle, but then after respawning, go back to my boat, skuttle again, and then run around the island as a major KEKW and F U to them

[2022-12-08 10:13:25] <%+hellkith> @Vupzy23 but that's why they made scutling a thing. The game even shows a notification, telling you to scuttle if you can't get out of it if you keep dieing and going to the ferry from it

[2022-12-08 10:25:26] <%Vupzy23> There‚Äôs dirt that gets in your pores and beard oil can remove that dirt and hair will grow in those places

[2022-12-08 10:30:16] <TwiZtiDJaY> Do you get a bonus beating a bigger ship in (hard mode)?
[2022-12-08 10:30:21] <%+CptZeromaniac> all good here! How are you @Bourbs23 ?
[2022-12-08 10:30:29] <TheRealMuttley> @Bourbs23 What year is this?!
[2022-12-08 10:30:38] VIEWERS: 776
[2022-12-08 10:30:40] <Y0RDANO> i like that. a multiplier based on competition level
[2022-12-08 10:30:40] <%+hellkith> From what I found looking into the whole MMR and found a couple of post on the SoT FAQ. Does seem that when someone who has a much higher MMR than you will gain less from beating you than when it's more equally matched
[2022-12-08 10:30:42] <TwiZtiDJaY> agreed
[2022-12-08 10:30:50] <%+CiriTheEvilMeowMeow> I agree but would it be possible. Like what would be used? Pirate's level? Ship's level? and what if it's a galleon; 3 people are same level as you but one is 150?
[2022-12-08 10:30:52] <%+Bourbs23> Super covid-y unfortunately @CptZeromaniac been in bed for the past 2 days.
[2022-12-08 10:30:54] <+seraph0309> makes a lot of sense
[2022-12-08 10:31:01] <%PixelShifts> Morning beard! How are you today
[2022-12-08 10:31:01] <TWO_DEEEE> so basically you should get REP based on your mmr kinda, because beating a higher mmr should raise your mmr more
[2022-12-08 10:31:06] <@%^Nightbot> Fancy yourself a hat or a T-shirt? üß¢  Check out Beard's merch shop here: https://www.shopbeardageddon.com
[2022-12-08 10:31:14] <%+CptZeromaniac> @Bourbs23 oh jeeez hope you get better soon buddy!
[2022-12-08 10:31:16] <MrNashaat> That's actually pretty clever
[2022-12-08 10:31:23] <%+Bourbs23> @Bourbs23 The year of peak social media
[2022-12-08 10:31:49] <PostmanPST> if you sink a very high streak crew you dont really get anything for that do you?
[2022-12-08 10:31:52] <TWO_DEEEE> maybe thats what taking down a champion is supposed to kinda be? i dunno
[2022-12-08 10:31:53] <%Vupzy23> I honestly think there shouldn‚Äôt be match making and they should just put everyone together and you get who you get.
[2022-12-08 10:31:55] <TwiZtiDJaY> I'm worried about once more stuff comes out the matchmaking time is going to be rough in the long run. Especially for the 1000
[2022-12-08 10:32:01] <%+CptZeromaniac> Myspace the best place there is!
[2022-12-08 10:32:12] <TheRealMuttley> @Vupzy23 I agree
[2022-12-08 10:32:17] <flashback_ttv> i agree i got totally shit on today by some toxic tdm guys who spanw camped me and we met them again and showed them hell at naval and sunk em but the rep for them winning or losing was not that much
[2022-12-08 10:32:21] <FolksySpade> isn't facebook for boomers? modCheck
[2022-12-08 10:32:30] <%+smartalec6661> morning dude
[2022-12-08 10:32:38] VIEWERS: 809
[2022-12-08 10:32:45] <TWO_DEEEE> tbh they need PVP leaderboards with MMR rank so people have another reason to grind the PVP
[2022-12-08 10:32:50] <Y0RDANO> that will completely eliminate casuals from the mode i think
[2022-12-08 10:33:27] <%p3rfect_death> its hard to do that with PVP on demand style.  Cause it goes the other way too.  losing alot more cause the sweaties are out will drive the pop down. think arena
[2022-12-08 10:33:27] <%Vupzy23> Or if they do have skill base matching they should give us different titles like bronze, gold, silver, platinum. But sea of thieves own type of titles
[2022-12-08 10:33:35] <eecaz> I quit fb when they put ads inbetween my friends on messenger.
[2022-12-08 10:33:40] <TWO_DEEEE> once the mmr gets balanced correctly they wont have to worry about sweats
[2022-12-08 10:33:45] <%+DoobyUK> MySpace is really facebook for GenX, but then facebook is facebook for GenX as well...basically GenX has a lot to answer for (I am GenX)
[2022-12-08 10:33:50] <ApocalypseUK> Ive just updated my myspace and changed the intro music when you click on it, myspaces days hey!.. Oh brb just got a message on msn messenger ;)
[2022-12-08 10:33:58] <FeedMeDotCom> or just make sbmm an opt-in, keep sbmm for newers players and ppl who want fair fight, and toggle sbmm off for those that want a random challenge
[2022-12-08 10:34:19] <%+CptZeromaniac> lets smurf up!
[2022-12-08 10:34:21] <%p3rfect_death> agreed
[2022-12-08 10:34:26] <$cats_are_a_conspiracy> i think there's a lot of limitations for making the matchups "fair" people will find exploits and cheeses for everything
[2022-12-08 10:34:28] <%$Nyaore> Also the win trading in Arena.
[2022-12-08 10:34:37] <+Ferumdriel> A huge advantage of current system is that you can join or abandon mode WHILE playing the game
[2022-12-08 10:34:38] VIEWERS: 809
[2022-12-08 10:34:39] <%+smartalec6661> im finding that we are getting brilliant at managing our ship so it takes a long line to sink in general. then the aggressive play will come in time
[2022-12-08 10:34:50] <%+CiriTheEvilMeowMeow> How do you even smurf in this game? Isn't it one copy of the game/one account? Like they buy the game multiple times?
[2022-12-08 10:34:53] <+Ferumdriel> In Arena often you had to be idle waiting for group to gather
[2022-12-08 10:34:57] <+ItsTatman> Does the adventure start today
[2022-12-08 10:35:03] <TwiZtiDJaY> One thing I wish I could dive with the flag from the ship I just sunk and could turn them all in the end. Instead of having to sail to outpost/reapers everytime to it in. (Only if you have hourglass on)
[2022-12-08 10:35:05] <Slugspore> Good point I concur
[2022-12-08 10:35:09] <+billium246> remember when they thought removing proximity chat for arena would save the mode?
[2022-12-08 10:35:14] <%+CptZeromaniac> @CiriTheEvilMeowMeow They just make a new Xbox account thats all needed
[2022-12-08 10:35:15] [Notification] johnny_bronze subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 29 months, currently on a 7 month streak! [Morning Beard. New pvp for me is a nightmare. 1 easy fight then 1 ridiculously hard fight. Haven‚Äôt had anymore than 2 wins in a row. Getting frustrated with it and leaving it for the time being. Preferred arena btw. legcLovegif]
[2022-12-08 10:35:24] <%Vupzy23> I think if arena changed to a battle royal death match and added different game modes and high rewards and a lot of cosmetics it would be much better
[2022-12-08 10:35:32] <Slugspore> Papa Smurf
[2022-12-08 10:35:36] <TWO_DEEEE> the most they could do, is do what Siege does and force cell phone 2 step for RANKED
[2022-12-08 10:35:40] <%+CiriTheEvilMeowMeow> @CptZeromaniac Really? So one pc has the game and they can create as many account as they want?
[2022-12-08 10:35:42] <%+Bourbs23> You've just said smurf so many times it doesn't sound real anymore.
[2022-12-08 10:35:45] <%Equalsk> Oh well I won't tell you what I thought Smurfing was AinsleyPeep
[2022-12-08 10:35:46] <%+DoobyUK> can you have more than one MS account on the same email though?
[2022-12-08 10:35:52] <+Vindicated8177> thought that was sand bagging
[2022-12-08 10:35:53] <%+CptZeromaniac> @CiriTheEvilMeowMeow Exactly how you said it!
[2022-12-08 10:35:56] <%Vupzy23> How do I talk like a little girl
[2022-12-08 10:36:05] <@%^Nightbot> Beard is partnered with Sneak Energy! Use code THEHWAY in the checkout cart. Thank you for your support! https://sneakenergy.com/collections/deals
[2022-12-08 10:36:05] <%+CptZeromaniac> @CiriTheEvilMeowMeow How did you think LD does it!
[2022-12-08 10:36:06] <firstmatelittled_jr> I lost two fights in a row against sweats and absolutely dominated the next three fights after
[2022-12-08 10:36:09] <%Drexnaaul> legcWat
[2022-12-08 10:36:12] <kruggarr> just put a phone number registration per account. Its more difficult get a new number than making a new email
[2022-12-08 10:36:14] <%+FilDEZ> Where is the fun in fighting lower level / less skilled people. The fights that I TRUELY enjoy are the one where you are evenly matched.
[2022-12-08 10:36:16] <%+CiriTheEvilMeowMeow> @CptZeromaniac Damn that's really easy LUL
[2022-12-08 10:36:18] <+billium246> is there an update tonight for the new adventure?
[2022-12-08 10:36:20] <AaronAdventurer> @vupzy23 helium
[2022-12-08 10:36:28] <+MrOptions89> Gday mang
[2022-12-08 10:36:33] <smcoffey> They can stop smurfing pretty fast do what korean mmo's do and force you to link your cell to the game and sms code to create an account they don't allow fake numbers either like google meet
[2022-12-08 10:36:33] <Ingwulf> I think it needs at least a year for it to be adjusted and to have the algorithm make good "descisions"
[2022-12-08 10:36:35] <Y0RDANO> itd be level 200 if i got more than 2 fights every 90 mins on NA
[2022-12-08 10:36:38] VIEWERS: 791
[2022-12-08 10:36:40] <Y0RDANO> id*
[2022-12-08 10:36:43] <+symebuoy> does that work? I thought the Elo MMR would quickly have you fighting people of your own skill, even if you deliberately lost loads
[2022-12-08 10:36:46] <%+CptZeromaniac> @CiriTheEvilMeowMeow yup thats why banning players is hard sometimes, when they go to IP Bans it would be much harder to make alts
[2022-12-08 10:36:48] <%+CiriTheEvilMeowMeow> @CiriTheEvilMeowMeow tbh i thought you needed another copy of the game LUL
[2022-12-08 10:37:07] <%+DoobyUK> @CiriTheEvilMeowMeow You can do the same on XBox, as long as either the account that owns it is also logged in OR the device is the 'home' xbox for the account that owns the game
[2022-12-08 10:37:07] <firstmatelittled_jr> @y0rdano I que less than 3 minutes in NA as a solo
[2022-12-08 10:37:08] <TWO_DEEEE> Siege forces you to add a phone number to play ranked only and you cant use it for any other account to smurf
[2022-12-08 10:37:12] <%Vupzy23> Some types in your chat and everyone can hear it.
[2022-12-08 10:37:21] <%+Bunny_VIB> @Vupzy23 TTS
[2022-12-08 10:37:24] <%+kettlehatxlr> for example you can't play overwatch for free if you don't link your phone
[2022-12-08 10:37:26] <Y0RDANO> @firstmatelittled_jr what time of day do you usually play?
[2022-12-08 10:37:26] <Mr_Kr0sis> yeah i pretty much never link my phone number to anything
[2022-12-08 10:37:27] <galm1> I'd also assume mmr is everywhere because everyones mmr is super new
[2022-12-08 10:37:28] <zoop_mp3> how far has the grind come
[2022-12-08 10:37:30] <%+CiriTheEvilMeowMeow> @CiriTheEvilMeowMeow Yeah I see.. oh well
[2022-12-08 10:37:31] <%+DoobyUK> MS can and does do device bans
[2022-12-08 10:37:31] <$cats_are_a_conspiracy> I don't like people knowing my name. there's no way they're having my number
[2022-12-08 10:37:34] <Ingwulf> Smurfing is a problem in all online games that wont go away
[2022-12-08 10:37:36] <Slugspore> oh it'll be fine let me get those digits...
[2022-12-08 10:37:42] <+jramboat> Servers are going down today for new quest ?
[2022-12-08 10:37:44] <prestonrayne> but SoT is an actual good game with Devs that care, Siege is not
[2022-12-08 10:37:45] <+billium246> no downtime today?
[2022-12-08 10:37:54] <%Vupzy23> Wait I needed to add context to my comment lol
[2022-12-08 10:37:54] <firstmatelittled_jr> @y0rdano Late, like 10pm-3am
[2022-12-08 10:37:58] <%+CptZeromaniac> But how does it work when you are a duo on a sloop sir... Wich account would be taken for match making?
[2022-12-08 10:38:01] <Ingwulf> Smurfing happened in For Honor as well
[2022-12-08 10:38:05] <%Vupzy23> !bot
[2022-12-08 10:38:07] <Ingwulf> Hunt Showdown
[2022-12-08 10:38:10] <%Vupzy23> How do I do it
[2022-12-08 10:38:11] <%+CiriTheEvilMeowMeow> @CptZeromaniac Yeah I know it's hard; people thought of banning motherboard; but well it would kill second-hand market LUL
[2022-12-08 10:38:22] <Y0RDANO> @firstmatelittled_jr i guess im just unlucky? im east coast. not sure if that matters
[2022-12-08 10:38:22] <%+Bunny_VIB> @Vupzy23 pay bits or sub :)
[2022-12-08 10:38:31] <TWO_DEEEE> @prestonrayne how dont the siege devs not care? the game was shit and turned around because the devs listened
[2022-12-08 10:38:35] <ElectricKnight> The problem with better match making would mean longer match making though, yeah?
[2022-12-08 10:38:36] <%$irskrub> lol
[2022-12-08 10:38:38] <%+DoobyUK> @CiriTheEvilMeowMeow MS *does* ban devices (xbox and pc)
[2022-12-08 10:38:38] VIEWERS: 791
[2022-12-08 10:38:40] <firstmatelittled_jr> @y0rdano could be, I'm in central also if that helps
[2022-12-08 10:38:52] <%$irskrub> for sure
[2022-12-08 10:38:53] <+billium246> I personally have been  having pretty good matches in the current sbmm. winning most but losing a lot too. seems to be working for me
[2022-12-08 10:38:53] <%+CptZeromaniac> @CiriTheEvilMeowMeow Yeah it definitly would, so would be better to go to IP Bans
[2022-12-08 10:39:08] <TWO_DEEEE> people can just use a VPN for IP bans
[2022-12-08 10:39:14] <%TBearO1> @prestonrayne that is just an ignorant comment. Of course the devs care about siege
[2022-12-08 10:39:16] <Y0RDANO> @firstmatelittled_jr or maybe its mmr? cuz im like 60-7 right now. maybe its finding it tough to find me opponents
[2022-12-08 10:39:16] <%+CiriTheEvilMeowMeow> @DoobyUK does it?
[2022-12-08 10:39:16] <%+CptZeromaniac> Would be better if Rare started IP Bans to be fair sir.
[2022-12-08 10:39:17] <%+Bunny_VIB> @CptZeromaniac is that a hardware ban is or is that different again?
[2022-12-08 10:39:21] <%tannkosten> Most people don't have a static IP address, so IP ban will do jack
[2022-12-08 10:39:22] <%Vupzy23> Ohhh mine read out loud before but you where fighting, I should sub during a YouTube type moment and say something ridiculous lol
[2022-12-08 10:39:33] <+Ferumdriel> it's a common issue in MMR based games
[2022-12-08 10:39:47] <%+CptZeromaniac> @Bunny_VIB Well then your internet connection is banned from Sea of thieves instead of only an account. Like they do in CoD and stuff
[2022-12-08 10:39:48] <%+DoobyUK> @CiriTheEvilMeowMeow yes, they used to do it quite a bit (mainly to do with modding consoles)
[2022-12-08 10:39:49] <Halo_J> KRAKEN!
[2022-12-08 10:39:55] <prestonrayne> @TBearO1 you do know Ubisoft is the Devs for Siege right?
[2022-12-08 10:39:57] <%+CiriTheEvilMeowMeow> Hardware ban @Bunny_VIB is banning component of your pc
[2022-12-08 10:39:57] <%Equalsk> IP bans don't work.
[2022-12-08 10:40:04] <+Ferumdriel> League of Legends had done so many incrementations of their matchmaking queue system to reduce waiting time while keeping matches competitive
[2022-12-08 10:40:08] <%+Bunny_VIB> @CptZeromaniac okies

[2022-12-08 10:40:13] <%$irskrub> @firstmatelittled_jr I'm central too and usually at this time I find matches instantly
[2022-12-08 10:40:16] <firstmatelittled_jr> @y0rdano I'm like 42-8 in solos, but I fight a lot of the same people it seems
[2022-12-08 10:40:24] <Rectifeye> IMO splitting your possible opponents from the start was a mistake. Cool for lore‚Ä¶
[2022-12-08 10:40:28] <%+CptZeromaniac> @Equalsk Not with VPN, but then they have Worse connection to the servers then with there own IP
[2022-12-08 10:40:29] <%+CiriTheEvilMeowMeow> @DoobyUK Oh yeah that's fair then; but yeh second-hand market would be destroyed (then again; do not buy second hand pc component LUL)
[2022-12-08 10:40:32] <Ingwulf> Oh geez.... My parrot just told my 1 year old to shut up...
[2022-12-08 10:40:38] <%Vupzy23> Yeah my comment was very out of context, and I think it shocked you a bit when I asked how do I talk like a little girl LOL
[2022-12-08 10:40:38] <+symebuoy> fir average players win streaks are really hard, in theory every fight us a 50-50 if MMR is working
[2022-12-08 10:40:38] <+Ferumdriel> Yeah, I completely agree. They need time and data to adjust such things.
[2022-12-08 10:40:38] VIEWERS: 791
[2022-12-08 10:40:39] <Ingwulf> just yelled Shut up!
[2022-12-08 10:40:41] <%+DoobyUK> can I post a link about hardware bans on the ms site?
[2022-12-08 10:40:42] <%Craig_Grim> I wonder where I'm gonna sit with MM as I wont be playing till the new year. So i guess ill avoid the sweats for the early stages.
[2022-12-08 10:40:46] <Y0RDANO> @firstmatelittled_jr guess im just unlucky then. appreciate the info though
[2022-12-08 10:40:48] <AaronAdventurer> On Xbox if you get reported for harassment you will be muted for months not being able to talk in games or Xbox party‚Äôs
[2022-12-08 10:40:48] <+MonsterMashie> if MMR works correctly everyone should have a 50/50 win loss record
[2022-12-08 10:40:49] <%+Bunny_VIB> so do DBD but that is only matching 5 peeps at a time lol
[2022-12-08 10:40:50] <%Equalsk> You don't need a VPN to change your IP. And VPNs are fast.
[2022-12-08 10:40:59] <TWO_DEEEE> @prestonrayne Ubisoft owns siege, but the same team doesnt make every ubisoft game dude KEKW

[2022-12-08 10:41:12] <@RletAkaMark> Morning handsome
[2022-12-08 10:41:14] <prestonrayne> @TWO_DEEEE doing the bare minimum for a gaming community, shouldn't be praised im sorry.
[2022-12-08 10:41:17] <%+DoobyUK> @CiriTheEvilMeowMeow it is intentional to brick the device I think, makes it so the person banned cant even get their money back I guess
[2022-12-08 10:41:19] <%TBearO1> @prestonrayne so? Have you played siege? Have you seen all the updates and changes they make? The game has come so far since it‚Äôs release. Just saying ‚Äúit‚Äôs Ubisoft they don‚Äôt care‚Äù is so ignorant
[2022-12-08 10:41:26] <%Vupzy23> I think they should make a merm faction and a dark brethren faction and a GMU faction in the future
[2022-12-08 10:41:32] <%$Nyaore> They should do what FF14 does. It's still faction v. faction but you don't get to pick. HOWEVER, you get credit towards the faction you chose to represent.
[2022-12-08 10:41:38] <prestonrayne> @TBearO1 100% your opinion, good day sir
[2022-12-08 10:41:39] <%+CptZeromaniac> @Equalsk Here in the netherlands you have 1 ip on your adress and it stays that one ip for a long while.
[2022-12-08 10:41:56] <%+Bunny_VIB> the monty hall problem

[2022-12-08 10:41:58] <TWO_DEEEE> @prestonrayne bare minmum? they flipped the whole game and saved it by listening to the players, did a whole season of nothing but game health, you def didnt play the game at launch to now

[2022-12-08 10:42:08] <@%+Raeeyore> sorry caps
[2022-12-08 10:42:09] <$cats_are_a_conspiracy> it's a mathematical advantage
[2022-12-08 10:42:13] <%eSwizy> which one is the bathroom door?
[2022-12-08 10:42:18] <%MadHatt0r> oooh Brooklyn 99
[2022-12-08 10:42:19] <%MrGr3x> changing decision is better
[2022-12-08 10:42:21] <%+CiriTheEvilMeowMeow> @CiriTheEvilMeowMeow Yeah, but like if you need motherboard and get a cheap second hand one. You're like "yay I can play Overwatch 2!" , you launch the game and you're just straight off banned LUL
[2022-12-08 10:42:25] <%+DoobyUK> its more complicated than that
[2022-12-08 10:42:25] <prestonrayne> @TWO_DEEEE yeah because it shouldn't take 7 years to fix mistakes, good day :)
[2022-12-08 10:42:26] <%+sassysapphirettv> This is some twilight zone sheez right now
[2022-12-08 10:42:26] <Ingwulf> If you flip enough times you will get very close to 50
[2022-12-08 10:42:27] <%+CptZeromaniac> @Raeeyore That was very naughty legcShook
[2022-12-08 10:42:30] <Ingwulf> but never completely
[2022-12-08 10:42:33] <ElectricKnight> Statistics and probability vs average, I think.
[2022-12-08 10:42:36] <%+Bunny_VIB> if theres a 50/50 chance of something, theres a 90% chance you will get it wrong
[2022-12-08 10:42:37] <eecaz> Just google 50-50-90 rule
[2022-12-08 10:42:38] VIEWERS: 807
[2022-12-08 10:42:42] <%Vupzy23> I‚Äôm too tired for this door talk, go back to something ridiculous like putting your boxers in a microwavec
[2022-12-08 10:42:43] <%TBearO1> @two_deeee just someone hating to be a hater. I‚Äôve played siege since launch. He doesn‚Äôt know what he‚Äôs talking about
[2022-12-08 10:42:49] <+symebuoy> yeah but the average given enough sessions of coin flipping would be 50 50
[2022-12-08 10:42:52] <@%+Raeeyore> @Raeeyore hush you legcShook
[2022-12-08 10:42:53] <%+XXShadowSaix> Flipping a coin whatever side is facing up when you flip has a higher chance of it landing the same
[2022-12-08 10:42:57] <$cats_are_a_conspiracy> let me explain the monty hall problem to you: maths!
[2022-12-08 10:43:00] <TWO_DEEEE> @TBearO1 he def doesnt lol but lets stop filling up beards chat
[2022-12-08 10:43:01] <%+CptZeromaniac> @Raeeyore xD legcShook
[2022-12-08 10:43:05] <$OhNotFunny_> Before the host opens a door there is a 1/3 probability that the car is behind each door. If the car is behind door 1 the host can open either door 2 or door 3, so the probability that the car is behind door 1 and the host opens door 3 is 1/3 √ó 1/2 = 1/6.
[2022-12-08 10:43:05] <Ingwulf> I mean if you flipped it quantillion times
[2022-12-08 10:43:06] <+dibreno> i just made fried potatoes, with garlic and sour cream
[2022-12-08 10:43:08] <+pezzychaos> But I thought 60% of the time it works everytime?
[2022-12-08 10:43:10] <%TBearO1> @prestonrayne it didn‚Äôt take 7 years though LUL
[2022-12-08 10:43:12] <%+hellkith> Isnt that the same as with your calculations on missing shots when double gunning? Kappa
[2022-12-08 10:43:19] <+dibreno> Anyone want some?
[2022-12-08 10:43:30] <prestonrayne> @TBearO1 K
[2022-12-08 10:43:30] <%+Bunny_VIB> it was used on Brooklyn 99 and I dont get it lol
[2022-12-08 10:43:31] <+billium246> it has been proven that the larger the number of tries the closer the coin flips will reach 50 50. like imagine 1000 flips
[2022-12-08 10:43:34] <%+CiriTheEvilMeowMeow> YES @dibreno
[2022-12-08 10:43:36] <+lulucho_l> Mmr is not even a percentage lol
[2022-12-08 10:43:41] <Dunceantix> if you were to cancel matchmaking now, would you be spawned onito another server, or back on the one you came from?
[2022-12-08 10:43:42] <%+FilDEZ> If something is 50/50, you can bet 100% that I will only get it right 60% of the time.
[2022-12-08 10:43:43] <Ingwulf> Yes Bilium
[2022-12-08 10:43:47] <+dibreno> @CiriTheEvilMeowMeow well cmon over friend : )
[2022-12-08 10:43:48] <Ingwulf> that's the thing

[2022-12-08 10:44:15] <Ingwulf> if you flip it a number of time... unimaginable amount of times... you will be very close to 50
[2022-12-08 10:44:18] <$OhNotFunny_> i just wrote it out for people that didn‚Äôt understand <3 @beardageddon
[2022-12-08 10:44:18] <%+Bunny_VIB> I dont think theres a mod to do a prediction lol
[2022-12-08 10:44:20] <%+Jonoelcoolio> I guess the player who loses though should in theory then be matched up against a slightly worse player (they would beat) and thus returning back to 50/50 (ish)
[2022-12-08 10:44:20] <+dibreno> hey beard have you tried the new vegan "chicken fried steak"
[2022-12-08 10:44:22] <Slugspore> dibreno, ido ido üòã

[2022-12-08 10:44:32] <%+Bunny_VIB> @Jonoelcoolio ello you
[2022-12-08 10:44:37] <ElectricKnight> I've played A LOT of D&D over the years and I watch the dice totals. Averages play out fairly consistently. But averages just smooth out the extremes and give a middling estimate. LUL
[2022-12-08 10:44:37] <%+CiriTheEvilMeowMeow> Nope, we still have prediction from Medium/Hunter fight XD
[2022-12-08 10:44:43] VIEWERS: 807
[2022-12-08 10:44:46] <PostmanPST> youre technically still taking up a slot in the same server until you get a match

[2022-12-08 10:46:04] <%+CiriTheEvilMeowMeow> @Ingwulf that's the spirit LUL
[2022-12-08 10:46:07] <%+Bourbs23> @kettlehatxlr Statistics may not lie, but they can be used to lie all the time. Correllation not implying causation  and all that jazz

[2022-12-08 10:48:20] <%p3rfect_death> even the best players can lose to getting knocked off early by a lucky shot from someone bad like me.

[2022-12-08 10:48:41] <Dunceantix> I thikn thats the difference between solo sloop though and duo slooping. In duo someone is always trying to board which can finish the fight really quick. In solo its more cannon on cannon as people tend not to board, so its more even?
[2022-12-08 10:48:44] <%Hegemon_3> @Shayru_ALG pretty much yes hegemo6Lol

[2022-12-08 11:03:14] <@%agitatedsquid> it's not that crazy. you level faster after level 50 for the other factions too
[2022-12-08 11:03:25] <%+Conbuck9> it makes a sound?
[2022-12-08 11:03:31] <%+J94Gaming> @MsThorns One of my team leads just said "close the laptop and go for a pint then" So i'm good LUL
[2022-12-08 11:03:35] <%TheMinishLink> That makes sense, i get it

[2022-12-08 11:04:08] <%+kettlehatxlr> Summon the Kraken
[2022-12-08 11:04:16] <TWO_DEEEE> probably level faster because it unlocks all the other in game achievements to work towards which also give you rep for getting them
[2022-12-08 11:04:19] <%Hegemon_3> @agitatedsquid after 50?
[2022-12-08 11:04:37] <%Hegemon_3> regular factions or what?
[2022-12-08 11:04:41] <%TheMinishLink> Allegiance rankup gets faster after 50 and 100?
[2022-12-08 11:04:43] <+JohnnyKAPPOW> the progression difficulty resets every 100, it'll get exponentially harder again.
[2022-12-08 11:04:49] VIEWERS: 918
[2022-12-08 11:04:49] <@%agitatedsquid> yeah, 50-75 is a lot quicker to level than 40-50 is
[2022-12-08 11:05:12] <Y0RDANO> is 75-100 like 40-50 again?
[2022-12-08 11:05:14] <@%agitatedsquid> maybe not for reapers but for GH, OOS and merchant anyway

[2022-12-08 11:06:41] <%+Crom_11> Some of them are ridiculous. I'm a Newcastle fan, there was an article 'RONALDO CLOSE TO SIGNING NEW CONTRACT OVER TALKS WITH NEWCASTLE'. The story - he's talked to Newcastle, and he's close to signing with a different club
[2022-12-08 11:06:42] <%+Teecay> BBC Radio 4's You and Yours programme obtained the driving licence used to impersonate Mr Hall, details of a bank account set up in his name to receive the proceeds of the sale, and phone recordings of a man claiming to be Mr Hall instructing solicitors to sell the house.  Once the house was sold to the new owner for ¬£131,000 by the person impersonating Mr Hall, they legally owned it.

[2022-12-08 11:10:11] <%+Crom_11> The classic one is that Welshman are prohibited from entering Chester before the sun rises and have to leave before the sun goes down. 10. Because of this, in Chester, it is technically ok to shoot a Welshman after midnight on Sunday with a crossbow, as long as it's in the city walls.
[2022-12-08 11:10:13] <%+DoobyUK> yeah thats a myth

[2022-12-08 11:10:29] <%$SirBrambles> its also illegal to hold a salmon suspiciously
[2022-12-08 11:10:35] <@%+Raeeyore> It is legal within the walls of Chester Town to shoot a Welshman with a crossbow after sunset

[2022-12-08 11:10:40] <+MudMachine> Hi, American here. Yes that is true. In my area. If you don't pay yoru property taxes after 3 years. The county will auction off your home to the highest bidder. The county only wants teh taxes  anything else collected over that amount is paid to the previous owner.
[2022-12-08 11:10:44] <%+Crom_11> @Raeeyore Copy paste beats you to it!

[2022-12-08 11:10:47] <%Equalsk> Pregnant women can wee in public without fear of arrest if they like, but understandably they don't.
[2022-12-08 11:10:48] <+RubyDarling0502> that's not actually true. Just because and old law like that, new laws supercede them. Such as laws about public indecency

[2022-12-08 11:17:46] <+MisterSchmutz> @J94Gaming it might also be just the overlay with streamlabs or elements
[2022-12-08 11:17:46] <AaronAdventurer> Ok beard here me out. Have the game where your cam is. And make yourself full screen.

[2022-12-08 11:39:23] <mrpotato_d3ad> I think it would be really cool if they‚Äôd implement a mode dedicated to pirate pvp. Maybe a 10 minute fight, in a ‚Äúcoliseum‚Äù of sorts, where two pirates, or two crews, fight, and whoever gets the most kills gets some gold? Maybe add commendations and such for it too. @beardageddon

[2022-12-08 11:55:38] <+IanG85> the fact that you can edit a curse and have them different is awesome, but the feeling like you're constantly in the main building of a fof is weird lol

[2022-12-08 12:24:07] <%Kato_Kiyomasa> I'm curious as to why you never use ‚Äúbattle sails‚Äù much any more: sails at half etc. Why is that?
[2022-12-08 12:24:15] <%TheMinishLink> Im terrible at using curses. I'll sink while holding 5 ballastballs
[2022-12-08 12:24:23] <GoldsMen> for me when i solo sloop, its always about timing, the 2 most used ammos for me have been regular cannons and blunder bombs to stagger people

[2022-12-08 12:25:04] <GoldsMen> then jig or sleep balls are the most common curses i find my self using when solo
[2022-12-08 12:25:08] <elzibaby> @Kato_Kiyomasa if you can learn to full sail cannon you are at a huge advantage as the other person will struggle to keep angle on you and struggle to hit you at speed too

[2022-12-08 12:31:59] <%Just_Goose95> Beard, for your next ad roll recording you should throw in a "Update your Gaia Online status" LUL
[2022-12-08 12:32:03] <%TheMinishLink> You fight another athena, "Flameheart has cast an illusion on the enemy ship" and it looks like a reaper ship
[2022-12-08 12:32:04] <%$Agent_0542> my longest was about 5 mins?
[2022-12-08 12:32:15] <@%MsThorns> @Just_Goose95 Wow, that's a throwback LUL
[2022-12-08 12:32:16] <%+Slipknot140488> I think solo sloops have the best queue times overall
[2022-12-08 12:32:20] <GoldsMen> i can indeed hear you right now
[2022-12-08 12:32:24] <%DeviLynDangeR> That's how we do in Florida.

[2022-12-08 12:32:44] <TwiZtiDJaY> Might depend on time of day I play late night and sometime takes 5-10 mins, but usually it's pretty quick. But I think the server does bug out sometimes.
[2022-12-08 12:32:50] <@%DroopyPiles> Hosts arent a thing now right?
[2022-12-08 12:32:55] <@%MsThorns> @DroopyPiles Nope
[2022-12-08 12:32:58] <%Craig_Grim> I did hear an idea from a streamer which involved Sea dogs as a 3rd faction who can sink either. which would give a better spread across the queues as they can match with either. ?? Thoughts. ??

[2022-12-08 12:33:49] <ZenChiWong> Increase the queue times you said Kappa
[2022-12-08 12:33:50] <%+Necrosack> fight the other faction and themselves
[2022-12-08 12:33:57] <TwiZtiDJaY> Hard mode definitely takes me over 10 mins to find a match.
[2022-12-08 12:33:57] <+WedCol> have you dove with brig or galeon
[2022-12-08 12:34:01] <%Just_Goose95> I think a third faction would be cool but they should just make it so that the factions can fight each other. Ik it doesn't fit the theme... but still.
[2022-12-08 12:34:02] <spiketravels> whats wrong with the queue times tho i get matched in maximum 20 seconds KEKW
[2022-12-08 12:34:11] <%+Frosset1X> lol
[2022-12-08 12:34:15] <+vercingetorxone> season 8 is bluw vs red then season 9 all out war

[2022-12-08 12:34:28] <@%^Nightbot> Beard doesn't like sailing brigs: https://clips.twitch.tv/CaringHealthyAsparagusHumbleLife It is therefore unlikely that he'll play with LD and Boxy on a brig (though it has happened before, chances are slim of it happening again).
[2022-12-08 12:34:28] <%+Frosset1X> get every faction in there and make arena with new ship types LUL
[2022-12-08 12:34:30] <GoldsMen> i think when the GMU gets in the game, they would be a perfect third faction since they are against all pirates, legends or reapers

[2022-12-08 12:38:01] <%Just_Goose95> Ok I'm fine with him being dead... but where is his ghost?
[2022-12-08 12:38:12] <%MrDwarfbeard> his beard is unreal

[2022-12-08 12:39:52] <Connorific> I got matched with another solo slooper, but another Athena sloop came in to assist in defeating me. don't know if they were working together from the start, but I feel like 2 ships vs 1 in one of these fights is wholly unfair and besides the point of this update. thoughts?

[2022-12-08 12:40:26] <Demon_of_the_Crows> does anyone know when the next adventure starts? I want Briggsy back. I really want Briggsy back.
[2022-12-08 12:40:39] <%+kettlehatxlr> @Connorific point of this update is to have pvp in adventure mode so it's ok i think
[2022-12-08 12:40:39] <@%MsThorns> @Demon_of_the_Crows Should be live now or they're still working on it.
[2022-12-08 12:40:41] <%+XXShadowSaix> If you ever want to shave your beard off would you do it as a charity goal and have it done live
[2022-12-08 12:40:41] <GoldsMen> steam is a horrible gauge it, since it is a minimal source of players

[2022-12-08 12:40:50] <Mudl123> @Connorific it is intended that you can get a 3rd party in. sometimes its bad luck, sometimes they just wait for you already.
[2022-12-08 12:41:01] <+IanG85> Yeah you got sea of thieves on the game pass for pc and console so steam is what a 3rd of the playerbase if it's even?
[2022-12-08 12:41:02] <%Craig_Grim> Well that's me out Beard have a good rest of the stream. Byeee.

[2022-12-08 12:41:12] <%Vupzy23> I hate how they separated the servers, they game would be much more lively if all players played together, if someone chooses to play on controller that‚Äôs a them problem not a game problem.
[2022-12-08 12:41:13] <Dynz_0> my bad then  bc i went after months to see in steam db and it was low pop
[2022-12-08 12:41:15] <%+LadyLyanne> Wait, what's crashing you?

[2022-12-08 12:41:34] <%+Bunny_VIB> @Vupzy23 it is crossplay?
[2022-12-08 12:41:40] <%BrokenShotgun> @goldsmen mm, I guess. I just assumed Ramsay would have had it moved, as he's unable to come back right now
[2022-12-08 12:42:00] <Astrojai> Howdy sir @beardageddon how many level til you get athena curse?
[2022-12-08 12:42:05] <+SteelTSSteel> @Vupzy23 I bet that most people that play on Xbox don't even know that there are Xbox only servers
[2022-12-08 12:42:05] <%+Crom_11> On the SoT website just go to the leaderboards

[2022-12-08 12:42:12] <%Vupzy23> @bunny_vib yes it‚Äôs cross play but there‚Äôs separate servers you can opt into to play on Xbox only
[2022-12-08 12:42:14] <%BrokenShotgun> steam is quite a small part of the player base
[2022-12-08 12:42:20] <%GamerGurll4lif3> isnt sea of thieves crossplay from console to pc?
[2022-12-08 12:42:22] <%+Bunny_VIB> @Vupzy23 thats a preference not a guaranteer

[2022-12-08 12:42:35] <GoldsMen> even after it was added on steam i got it on xbox app
[2022-12-08 12:42:36] <@%agitatedsquid> it's still not an accurate way of seeing who's last
[2022-12-08 12:42:40] <Astrojai> Ohh niceee
[2022-12-08 12:42:41] <%Vupzy23> I play on controller but I don‚Äôt complain about Pc players I just got good enough to hold my own against majority of them
[2022-12-08 12:42:41] <+IanG85> @Vupzy23 thats the same as saying if you play on pc and not console it's a you problem lol
[2022-12-08 12:42:50] <+SteelTSSteel> @bunny_vib 99% of the time you will get dropped on xbox only servers

[2022-12-08 12:43:25] <NickFromPlanetEarth> its cool, but i think i prefer the legendary curse more and gold curese

[2022-12-08 12:43:43] <Astrojai> Congrats @beardageddon aiming for reaper curse now?
[2022-12-08 12:43:45] <%Vupzy23> Xbox and Pc should of never been separated and they even separated it more by making it so Xbox players with keyboard and mouse can‚Äôt play with controller players in Xbox only servers
[2022-12-08 12:43:48] <@%MsThorns> @LadyLyanne There is no update, they're putting the Adventure on and that's it!

[2022-12-08 12:45:27] <%+Slipknot140488> @Vupzy23 nop.. considering you have 0 aim assist on controller, a decent keyboard and mouse player will always destroy the controller .. unless they add a aim assist on controller that should remain an option
[2022-12-08 12:45:29] <+Dymondzy> level 1000 of what?

[2022-12-08 12:46:24] <Connorific> @Mudl123 I thought the whole point of this update was to get one-ship-on-one fights. to work together with multiple ships waiting for one to get invaded and then everyone dogpiling on that ship is horrendously unfair
[2022-12-08 12:46:32] <%BrokenShotgun> it's a skull issue
[2022-12-08 12:46:47] <%Vupzy23> And naval is easier on controller supposedly.

[2022-12-08 12:47:18] <%BrokenShotgun> it's their first live update for the adventure too, so it may be a little rocky
[2022-12-08 12:47:21] <GoldsMen> i think with this update arguments of "only 2% of players like pvp based on this very out of context stat" since most servers are just combat rn
[2022-12-08 12:47:29] <Astrojai> I hope you and boxy do the new adventure tomorrow
[2022-12-08 12:47:29] <%TheMinishLink> Thats okay Beard, just continue the crappening
[2022-12-08 12:47:36] <%+XXShadowSaix> You could save it for tommorow and do it with the bromance
[2022-12-08 12:47:45] <+SteelTSSteel> They should've taken the servers down to fix a lot of stuff
[2022-12-08 12:47:45] <%+Bunny_VIB> @Angelkatie1 You Choose either of the two options, Xbox and the game will search the "Sea" for any Lobbies with only Xbox players, if a spot is open they drop you in. IF by a small chance there is no Xbox servers, you will be placed into one with Both xbox and Pc.
[2022-12-08 12:47:45] <%+Slipknot140488> @Vupzy23 on any game you want, controller has aim assist and they put you in with pc players.. this is better this way.. if you want to play only against controller players because you are controller is very fair.. :)
[2022-12-08 12:47:45] <wabi_kanabi> Have you started the new adventure yet?
[2022-12-08 12:47:49] <%HovisBob> @Vupzy23 ive recently switched from series x to PC and MnK is honestly so much better IMO. its what you feel most comfortable with though

[2022-12-08 12:48:52] <GoldsMen> i just realized i didnt finish my comment, the arguments that say "only 2% like pvp" will be basically void, because this shows that people absolutely do like pvp
[2022-12-08 12:48:53] <+dibreno> What‚Äôs tdm mean
[2022-12-08 12:48:56] <$SankaUK> tavern
[2022-12-08 12:48:57] <Astrojai> True. Game being kinda unpredictable makes it more fun
[2022-12-08 12:49:00] <%+Bunny_VIB> @Angelkatie1 I just copied thast from SOT websiste but you do you :) its not 100%
[2022-12-08 12:49:01] <elmerusfudd> @SankaUK that was cool
[2022-12-08 12:49:06] <%+nutbaneee> 100%
[2022-12-08 12:49:09] <+SteelTSSteel> @SankaUK tavern drinking mode
[2022-12-08 12:49:15] <%+Spidek> i would like to just open game and choose tdm mode

[2022-12-08 12:49:21] <@%+Raeeyore> @Bunny_VIB Bunny is right, it is a preference
[2022-12-08 12:49:26] <%+Spidek> cuz its best way to train
[2022-12-08 12:49:29] <%+Bunny_VIB> @Raeeyore thank you xxx
[2022-12-08 12:49:38] <%BrokenShotgun> they could turn the Sea Dogs into a TDM arena maybe?
[2022-12-08 12:49:49] <+IanG85> Yeah they went and got those supplies, do the same if you don't like it. Couldn't agree more.
[2022-12-08 12:49:49] <elmerusfudd> stacking supplies also doesnt guarantee wins
[2022-12-08 12:49:52] <+Dymondzy> is the pvp mode skill related MM or just random?
[2022-12-08 12:49:52] <@%agitatedsquid> can and do Kappa
[2022-12-08 12:49:52] <$SankaUK> Good morning

[2022-12-08 12:49:59] <Ill_ser3nity_llI> Would be so cool to see the Sea Dogs Tavern opened up in Adventure mode
[2022-12-08 12:50:05] <%TheMinishLink> @BrokenShotgun Thats what arena turned into basically, everyone just did TDM instead of objectives
[2022-12-08 12:50:08] <Astrojai> True

[2022-12-08 12:50:16] <GoldsMen> people use the arena stat entirely out of context since if they included the fact that most players who did pvp while arena was a thing, did it in adventure still, that argument would look irrational
[2022-12-08 12:50:19] <%+Bailowulf> Tbh,  the fifth Pirates life Tall tale is a quick and easy supply up if people are wanting something easy lol
[2022-12-08 12:50:23] <+Dymondzy> yes @Beardageddon
[2022-12-08 12:50:24] <%+Spidek> becouse now its like u need bail people ships to train on them
[2022-12-08 12:50:28] <marotage1> you can stack 1k cannons and get one balled
[2022-12-08 12:50:30] <%+Spidek> so they dont sink to fast
[2022-12-08 12:50:37] <LazusKristus> @Bailowulf watch out there is a bug with that where you cant fire cannons
[2022-12-08 12:50:38] <%BrokenShotgun> @theminishlink oh I mean the actual island! it's pretty wasted atm
[2022-12-08 12:50:48] <%+ImoutoLight> lets stack 1billion cannons and sink to a keg play
[2022-12-08 12:50:51] <%+ImoutoLight> LUL
[2022-12-08 12:50:53] <+Jznjo> how‚Äôs things King, pleasure coming back and saying hello
[2022-12-08 12:50:54] <@%agitatedsquid> if i fight someone and i run out of supplies i start hotmicing "OOH LOOK AT LITTLE SUPPLY SALLY OVER HERE WITH ALL YOUR SUPPLIES"
[2022-12-08 12:50:55] <+McHermie> @Bailowulf It often bugs your ship so you cant shoot the cannons
[2022-12-08 12:51:01] <%+Bailowulf> @LazusKristus   Thats a game feature lol

[2022-12-08 12:51:15] <0Nici> When u are searching of a battle on a solo sloop? Do u only find Solo sloops or are there also duo sloops?
[2022-12-08 12:51:16] VIEWERS: 990
[2022-12-08 12:51:38] <%+Spidek> i didnt  get chance to play arena cuz i started in may
[2022-12-08 12:51:41] <@%agitatedsquid> chat been real contentious the past couple of weeks. i miss the days where i had a monopoly on all the arguments with you
[2022-12-08 12:51:48] <GoldsMen> the arena stat doesnt even include the total number of players who engaged in pvp or stole loot in adventure, it was just a stat for an unpopular side game mode
[2022-12-08 12:51:55] <0Nici> Ah alright thanks mate ^^
[2022-12-08 12:52:08] <%+Bunny_VIB> im gonna stop having an opinion lol
[2022-12-08 12:52:08] <+dibreno> Beard ur underwater ur drowning do u need help
[2022-12-08 12:52:15] <%+DoobyUK> more like 2 hours for one game
[2022-12-08 12:52:25] <GoldsMen> but those people use that stat as a "only 2% of everyone played pvp at all!...just ignore adventure mode" argument
[2022-12-08 12:52:30] <%+DoobyUK> I gave up on arena because I just spent the whole time sat in the tavern
[2022-12-08 12:52:36] <Astrojai> 2 win streak then turning in is the fastest way to level up?
[2022-12-08 12:52:40] <+dibreno> Can‚Äôt fucking sleep
[2022-12-08 12:52:45] <Ceniter> i still haven't seen pve spawns in the middle of a fight, skelly ships and megs should spawn 15 minutes after the fight starts so it doesn't go forever
[2022-12-08 12:52:45] <%+Bunny_VIB> legcLovegif legcLovegif o its ok Beard xx
[2022-12-08 12:52:45] <@%agitatedsquid> xbox preferred servers doesn't guarantee xbox only
[2022-12-08 12:52:47] <termichator> Really good looking shipset
[2022-12-08 12:52:47] <@%agitatedsquid> that was the discussion
[2022-12-08 12:52:48] <+billdozer101> do you get more money when you sell if u have a streak?
[2022-12-08 12:52:54] <+Jznjo> arena in Australia was so rogue man, ended up in Europe servers for the most part
[2022-12-08 12:53:01] <%Thecaptain85> whats good beard!
[2022-12-08 12:53:08] <%+Bunny_VIB> you'd have thought so Beard lol
[2022-12-08 12:53:17] VIEWERS: 990
[2022-12-08 12:53:27] <+dibreno> Is their aim assist on Xbox SoT?
[2022-12-08 12:53:29] <GoldsMen> people just dont know that context will make or break an argument in a debate
[2022-12-08 12:53:30] <%+Nightfire255> Yeah, you do.
[2022-12-08 12:53:55] <$ThatH1ghLife> Are you doing the LD strat of cashing in every 2 fights?
[2022-12-08 12:53:57] <0Nici> Are in Europe only the UK Servers? Cause I¬¥m from Germany and always have a Ping of 80 x)
[2022-12-08 12:53:59] <Neil_H20> meow says the chicken
[2022-12-08 12:54:02] <%$Ugla1000> We lower faction, then sell . Selling first remove the treasury grade at your faction
[2022-12-08 12:54:04] <Ceniter> you don't get more money with a streak, you get more alligiance when you sink someone with loot on board, money multiplier only comes from emmisary value
[2022-12-08 12:54:25] <%+XXShadowSaix> Beard pet pigs in SOT yay or nay
[2022-12-08 12:54:31] <%+DoobyUK> yeah it tells you in the popup when you actually join, but I dont think I have ever *not* got xbox + controller servers
[2022-12-08 12:54:39] <%+ImoutoLight> honestly every 2 fights is a good spot to lower idk if that was a joke or not but I do that aswell xd
[2022-12-08 12:54:40] <%+Jmapuk> Good morning Sir hope your having the most excellent time on the seas
[2022-12-08 12:54:41] <+Dymondzy> so when you win a lot does the game put you against better enemies or its just random? @Beardageddon
[2022-12-08 12:54:41] <%+Crom_11> I'm on Xbox and haven't had a single fight against PC for season 8 unless I've picked PC servers. In matchmaking it even comes up with a notice saying you might want to switch to PC servers if wait times are long
[2022-12-08 12:54:42] <@%agitatedsquid> i've been getting 80-100 recently for some reason
[2022-12-08 12:54:42] <Astrojai> LD is like SoT guru. Gotta trust the old man
[2022-12-08 12:54:45] <%+Nightfire255> @Ceniter The more ships you sink, the higher your hourglass value is
[2022-12-08 12:54:45] <%TheMinishLink> LD is a math wizard when it comes to SoT
[2022-12-08 12:54:50] <TwiZtiDJaY> Im hitting faction champion then cashing in for the commendation
[2022-12-08 12:54:55] <GoldsMen> my favorite thing about this mode, even tho it pairs my play style perfectly, its the music... the music ties the gameplay together too well
[2022-12-08 12:54:58] <$ThatH1ghLife> Yeah, me too, that‚Äôs seems to be the best for levelling up. I‚Äôm looking forward to seeing the GCG v2 tomorrow with boxy.
[2022-12-08 12:55:01] <%+DoobyUK> the big mistake is people think its xbox only, it isnt its xbox + controller - xbox+m&k is *meant* to go on the global ones
[2022-12-08 12:55:02] <rojozombie> Ahoy bro
[2022-12-08 12:55:05] <+IanG85> @DoobyUK I have never been put on a pc server while having xbox only selected either.
[2022-12-08 12:55:10] <Ceniter> i love the fact that Rare gave us the pocket rat and crab :D

[2022-12-08 12:56:10] <%+ImoutoLight> the sloops without a captain are rentals the entire community started calling it that to be honest
[2022-12-08 12:56:12] <@%agitatedsquid> @Jznjo that's the queue waiting for a pvp fight
[2022-12-08 12:56:17] <GoldsMen> name your captain ship after the factions to trick some into thinking your a rental

[2022-12-08 13:03:46] <hoedestroyer109> idk about open crew im 2 sweaty to do that XD
[2022-12-08 13:03:57] <hoedestroyer109> i could never open crew is prob random tho
[2022-12-08 13:04:01] <%BrokenShotgun> ooof
[2022-12-08 13:04:04] <+McHermie> aye
[2022-12-08 13:04:05] <kgkchris712> @iang85  no server preferences when it‚Äôs open crew
[2022-12-08 13:04:07] <chairmanchenchilla> this guy is cracked
[2022-12-08 13:04:08] <+IanG85> @hoedestroyer109 fair comment haha
[2022-12-08 13:04:11] <lucasiscute> @Beardageddon can chainshots make holes and break the wheel or only the mast ?
[2022-12-08 13:04:34] <+IanG85> @kgkchris712 so open crew is truly open, fair enough.
[2022-12-08 13:04:42] <hoedestroyer109> even a normal cannon is if it hits wheel and u dont have the best turn atm
[2022-12-08 13:04:45] <GoldsMen> chain shots destroy your wheel
[2022-12-08 13:04:46] <kgkchris712> That‚Äôs the one @iang85
[2022-12-08 13:05:01] <%Just_Goose95> Chainshot when hitting the hull put one t1 hole in and upgrade a hole 1 tier.
[2022-12-08 13:05:16] <%Just_Goose95> Read that in a patch notes somewhere

[2022-12-08 13:06:03] <Dynz_0> oh  ty
[2022-12-08 13:06:37] <%+kettlehatxlr> wow you actualy read that almost perfect
[2022-12-08 13:06:58] <brucewayne63> Do you think they should add timer in these pvp fights? because some 1v1 fights takes 1-2 hours @Beardageddon
[2022-12-08 13:07:08] <%+kettlehatxlr> name of the guy who subbed, it's turkish
[2022-12-08 13:07:16] <kgkchris712> @brucewayne63  no

[2022-12-08 13:07:31] <DarkKraken69> I agree with beard. 100,000%
[2022-12-08 13:07:34] <chairmanchenchilla> no timers
[2022-12-08 13:07:37] <DarkKraken69> It's up to you to do whatever you want
[2022-12-08 13:07:43] <chairmanchenchilla> but I would like some sort of shrinking circle
[2022-12-08 13:07:43] <lucasiscute> most people that stream SoT are either good at PvP or at naval but it looks like you are good at both üòª
[2022-12-08 13:07:43] <Astrojai> @kapteinherres he got it :)
[2022-12-08 13:07:43] <kgkchris712> @kapteinherres  he‚Äôs got it
[2022-12-08 13:07:46] <Ceniter> just make pve start spawning aftert 15 minutes
[2022-12-08 13:07:52] <chairmanchenchilla> or a cumulative damage system would be interesting
[2022-12-08 13:08:13] <chairmanchenchilla> like if the same hole gets hit like 10 times it stays open
[2022-12-08 13:08:27] <ryverbell> Cumulative wouldnt work cuz of the tryhards and exploits
[2022-12-08 13:08:35] <dj111531> honestly I love the long fights it's just good practice as long as person isn't just running
[2022-12-08 13:08:38] <+Ukillmelongtime> drop anchor pvp or flip a coin
[2022-12-08 13:08:57] <%FatherFil> How about if an amazing cannon shot knocked your cannonball barrels off the boat.
[2022-12-08 13:09:08] <%Just_Goose95> Yeah like if you don't want a battle of attrition, play until you aren't having fun and then let your boat sink. You still get rep and experience whilst wasting less time.
[2022-12-08 13:09:08] <%AYRlS> people screaming for tmers on this need to go play candy crush for the instant dopamine hits, I hope rare dont listen to them

[2022-12-08 13:22:18] <DarkKraken69> 400 ping? Thats why I like tarkov. Ping lockouts
[2022-12-08 13:22:19] <Ceniter> i can't even load cannons when i'm on 400 ping
[2022-12-08 13:22:31] <%Kato_Kiyomasa> What?! Is it really Paul Rudd? Or is this some internet joke I'm oblivious to?

[2022-12-08 13:22:44] <+Gryotta> He re-grabbed that ladder like it was magnetic velcro

[2022-12-08 13:23:36] <+MisterSchmutz> maybe its only possible with 400 ping :D
[2022-12-08 13:23:38] <@%agitatedsquid> if he had 400 ping he was probably trying to let go of the ladder and the input was so delayed he accidentally regrabbed it

[2022-12-08 13:30:28] <%+kettlehatxlr> their motto while doing that is "you spend a lot of money to protect a piece of painting but you don't do anything to protect our world"

[2022-12-08 13:35:06] <DarkKraken69> @AvmanDGI people are constantly asking for one, and no they didn't. I am against it, its a skill gap//difference. Just like I'm against people who think running isn't a viable strategy even in this mode. Skill gap. If you're good, you can win either way

[2022-12-08 13:38:57] <+AvmanDGI> @DarkKraken69 Oh me too. That's why when I heard "time limit" i was like WHAT? TIME LIMIT?!
[2022-12-08 13:39:03] <@%JaffalsRada> I remember I stopped playing for a while purely because I had 4 islands to go to, and each one was erupting as I went there.
[2022-12-08 13:39:04] <%boxysbestfriendmattdamon> When they had no volcanoes I stacked ashen vaults 3 days in a row at the end of the adventure. Big money.
