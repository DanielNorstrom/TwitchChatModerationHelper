[2023-01-06 08:50:44] <%Criptonix100> I wonder if mike will play Vindicator at 80 KEKW
[2023-01-06 08:51:26] <%Criptonix100> Inspector Floor inspecting the floor KEKL

[2023-01-06 08:52:15] <%TheRealJinjix> Bwop TeaTime -> Just spent 2 hours on a GW2 jumping puzzle and didn't even finish. Fuck this game. Madge
[2023-01-06 08:52:35] <%Zeroslayer> Yeah never liked jumping puzzles.
[2023-01-06 08:52:55] <+KeyrisNyan> at least it's not lotro's ones
[2023-01-06 08:53:03] <%TheRealJinjix> If you've seenthe underground Aetherpirate ship one... fuck that nonsense
[2023-01-06 08:53:13] <%Zeroslayer> I straight up cheezed at least two jumping puzzles when getting the griffon and skyscale Madge
[2023-01-06 08:53:36] <%Criptonix100> I've finished the Not so Secret JP KEKW
[2023-01-06 08:53:45] <%Criptonix100> thanks to a mesmer who had ports
[2023-01-06 08:54:18] <%Criptonix100> we all were going back n forth in a party with the TP to friend and Mesmer port
[2023-01-06 08:54:25] <%TheRealJinjix> I kept falling down the well when trying to get up on the really high jump pats... I was malding so hard
[2023-01-06 08:54:30] <%TheRealJinjix> parts*
[2023-01-06 08:55:09] <%Criptonix100> have you gone into the steam parts where it knocks you off? KEKW
[2023-01-06 08:55:37] <%Criptonix100> and where you can't see anything (unless you are an Asura)
[2023-01-06 08:56:04] <%TheRealJinjix> Not sure? I got past the "ship", to the part where you jump off the side onto the pillars, then UP two jump pads, then keep falling off there and right down into the well
[2023-01-06 08:56:13] <%TheRealJinjix> So if its after that, then no, not got to it
[2023-01-06 08:56:19] <%Criptonix100> oh the ship part is easy
[2023-01-06 08:56:30] <%Criptonix100> the part after that is really hard
[2023-01-06 08:56:36] <%TheRealJinjix> Yeah, the ship is easy mode, but when you have to do those vertical jumps
[2023-01-06 08:56:46] <%TheRealJinjix> which then send you right back to the bottom... its torture
[2023-01-06 08:57:00] <%TheRealJinjix> I gave up. Maybe another day.
[2023-01-06 08:57:11] <+KeyrisNyan> I think I did this one, since it is in the base game zones
[2023-01-06 08:57:20] <%Criptonix100> I remember in the launch day of LWS1 i was raging too
[2023-01-06 08:57:31] <%TheRealJinjix> I was like "I've done Kugane Tower... I got this!"... I didn't, in fact, got it. Madge
[2023-01-06 08:57:57] <+KeyrisNyan> I'll have to check later

[2023-01-06 09:55:06] <@%Methuzahla> @jovitacky very! lots of things you can hop on and do casually. Never really feel the need to catchup with how gear works, and you can play how you like!
[2023-01-06 09:55:09] <Samibacsi> GW2 needs to make the core experience better. The expansions are great but getting there is a chore

[2023-01-06 10:03:50] <%fripple4> i'm not sure total blindness is the intended approach for gw games. they've always been heavily tied to information resources
[2023-01-06 10:03:55] <%MistahZed> @MeridianPuppeteer Agree LUL
[2023-01-06 10:03:55] <itsjoodu> assign stats and I think you can salvage it
[2023-01-06 10:03:56] <surdent> it's only vanilla story rewards
[2023-01-06 10:04:00] <Stinkefedt> Sadly it's from the weird reward stuff they're giving out :/
[2023-01-06 10:04:01] <+chrisnmbr1> I would personally salvage almost everything if its not an upgrade
[2023-01-06 10:04:01] <Fraven85> @Preachlfw just as i was thinking about giving GW2 a shot yesterday, i see you playing it. thx for getting me hooked. Complete Collection purchase it is.
[2023-01-06 10:04:07] <+Mackemm73> Karma gear and quest rewards just delete or put in mystic forge. Worthless
[2023-01-06 10:04:08] <+Bloom_HD> @Preachlfw General loop is equip best gear -> salvage everything else -> send mats to mat storage

[2023-01-06 10:04:23] <brucemalt> @MeridianPuppeteer Hmmm, no it's bad design, it's inconsistent, you should be able to sell or salvage them. It's dumb that there is a category of items you can't sell.

[2023-01-06 10:05:02] <MeridianPuppeteer> @MeridianPuppeteer I don't disagree, been playing GW2 for 8 years before quitting for FFXIV, so it is valid. But it's also a lot of overthinking for just some random blue leveling gear.

[2023-01-06 10:05:28] <vivianrexcroft> Usually you would salvage, but since it's from leveling rewards you can't so you'd just delete it. And trophies that won't salvage or be put in storage can be sold

[2023-01-06 10:24:55] <yuiona> this is probably the slowest part in any dungeon
[2023-01-06 10:24:55] <frume13> dungeons are OLD content, which hasn't been touched in years.
[2023-01-06 10:24:58] <+Destrina> This event is reasonably difficult without a bunch of minmaxed level 80s speedrunning it.

[2023-01-06 10:26:09] <yuiona> i mean back then in vanilla, when not everybody knew the spawn locations and builds werent as refined yet this encounter sometimes was kinda rough
[2023-01-06 10:26:09] <Dschonathan> These encounters used to be the hardest shit ever in 2012 COPIUM
[2023-01-06 10:26:10] <korgir> it was so much harder at the start but  now with  the dps its easyyy to destroy them before they spawn adds

[2023-01-06 10:26:52] <brucemalt> @KelticNight Yeah, it's really not. They could have iterated for 10 years and made it amazing.
[2023-01-06 10:26:52] <Vallun> the prophecy
[2023-01-06 10:26:53] <%muzuq> is there such a thing as a dps meter in this game?
[2023-01-06 10:26:54] <Dschonathan> @KelticNight it literally is because this content was designed for people that have no fucking clue what they are doing. Now it is done by people that are incredibly skilled
[2023-01-06 10:26:54] <+kalamari__> @KelticNight the excuse is not it being 10 years old, the excuse is its abandoned for 10 years
[2023-01-06 10:27:00] <%+대전허리케인 (daejeon_hurricane)> for people wondering, they just cylce through a small number of spawn points,
[2023-01-06 10:27:02] <+Destrina> This is a really common way to farm for dungeon gear, probably does it a lot.
[2023-01-06 10:27:07] <+KlosterKatten> when you don't balance your games old content for new stuff.
[2023-01-06 10:27:08] <hyphenp> @muzuq yeah you can download one
[2023-01-06 10:27:13] <%+TottWriter> @KelticNight I mean, it's not an excuse, it's just...almost immediately after launch ANet decided not to support dungeons. So the active community know that this isn't the content to go for
[2023-01-06 10:27:16] <%trebolf> my man has this down pat

[2023-01-06 10:27:42] <yuiona> it summons elemental weapons
[2023-01-06 10:27:46] <%+TottWriter> In GW2, people do World Boss trains while levelling, not dungeons
[2023-01-06 10:27:51] <SpiritoftheFourWinds> @Gforcez1337 the problem is its solved content being run by gered and knowledgeable players, this was way more hecktic back in the day people wern't minmaxed to hell and know what theyre doing

[2023-01-06 10:28:22] <%fripple4> what games was he playing that taught him you don't have to open chests?
[2023-01-06 10:28:22] <+KlosterKatten> @Gforcez1337 or maybe power creep is a real thing and anet is bad for not balancing stuff properly
[2023-01-06 10:28:24] <@%Methuzahla> "Oh Im a ghost I cant die!.. Im dying"
[2023-01-06 10:28:30] <mez_taz> this is basically your average WoW heroic dungeon
[2023-01-06 10:28:31] <%+Gforcez1337> @Gforcez1337 Yea I guess that will make a big difference, but why is Mike getting grouped with people so far ahead in level as him? Is it just the way GW2 works or just the lack of other people (more around his level) that do this content?

[2023-01-06 10:29:00] <%NomadHook> @Gforcez1337 Lack of people, and there is no queue system, just an LFG
[2023-01-06 10:29:07] <+Criti> @Gforcez1337 low level people dont know how to start an lfg group probably
[2023-01-06 10:29:08] <Samibacsi> Where's the DPS meter? Lemme see those giga numbers
[2023-01-06 10:29:08] <+Destrina> @Gforcez1337 He just randomly joined a path3 explorable dungeon group not knowing what it was.
[2023-01-06 10:29:10] <%+itshoneyyellow> I remember getting the GS from here back in the day and thinking it was the coolest thing ever
[2023-01-06 10:29:10] <+KlosterKatten> @TottWriter More like no current devs left who did them LUL
[2023-01-06 10:29:15] <%Mordwyl> Oh shit an actual dungeon?
[2023-01-06 10:29:17] <lightriver29> Bad encounter design but ah this room is so pretty <3
[2023-01-06 10:29:22] <%urbish_> so what group content in this game is good, the raids?
[2023-01-06 10:29:23] <%spejspag> There where no dwarves here, just humans
[2023-01-06 10:29:24] <%+TottWriter> @KlosterKatten Well that too lol
[2023-01-06 10:29:26] <Wanya2007> @Gforcez1337 there is no matchmaking and the  party if fine with carrying him
[2023-01-06 10:29:26] <%trebolf> MAD DEEPS
[2023-01-06 10:29:32] <mez_taz> @Gforcez1337 there is no grouping of players you just que and take whoever is playing this content. Not a lot of new players so everyone doing it knows what to do
[2023-01-06 10:29:35] <+redcobra_II> @Gforcez1337 more or less all content is lvl 80 stuff, you can access this dungeon at lvl 30 though its weird, he joined a group for explorable path, newer players will typically do the "story" path first before 80
[2023-01-06 10:29:36] <%Mordwyl> @urbish_ Fractals
[2023-01-06 10:29:40] <AeilAwadar> @Gforcez1337 Its mostly story content. The actual "dungeons" are in the fractals system, meant for level 80
[2023-01-06 10:29:48] <+Brandonhipster> he should do these again with people of same lvl
[2023-01-06 10:29:51] <yuiona> this room is reused in other paths
[2023-01-06 10:29:54] <hschuckerbee> I thought explorable required story... did I miss something?
[2023-01-06 10:29:56] <%beskarsilver> @urbish_ You have raids, strikes and fractals. Dungeons are unfortunately dead content
[2023-01-06 10:29:58] <%spejspag> It's basically ARR/Classic lvl dungeon
[2023-01-06 10:29:58] <%+val89> @Gforcez1337 Yeah, the LFG is a manual "pick a group" style - rather than the 'automatic match' style of WoW or whatever
[2023-01-06 10:30:02] <@%^Streamlabs> Check out our merch! https://preachgaming.com/shop/
[2023-01-06 10:30:02] <+Criti> you level up so fast in this game it doesnt really make sense to see a lot of lvl 30s
[2023-01-06 10:30:04] <%+Gforcez1337> Fair enough, I assumed he was put in the group :P
[2023-01-06 10:30:05] <+Destrina> The encounter design (while not amazing) is a lot better when you don't have 4 minmaxed 80s annihilating it.
[2023-01-06 10:30:05] <Sermenator> LULW
[2023-01-06 10:30:09] <Wanya2007> @Brandonhipster that would be quite hard
[2023-01-06 10:30:10] <mez_taz> @Brandonhipster doubt he will find many
[2023-01-06 10:30:15] <%+TottWriter> @hschuckerbee To go in yourself does, but the party were already in the instance

[2023-01-06 10:51:43] <mez_taz> @LasyPanda every time you get a buff you have a corresponding voice line. Nothing can bring me down is the stability buff
[2023-01-06 10:51:43] <%spejspag> It is kinda a good idea to run all dungeons in story mode in order
[2023-01-06 10:51:47] <TheBassett> Dungeons are outdated 10 year old content. Best experienced with a grp of new players. But the modern 5player stuff is Fractals.
[2023-01-06 10:51:48] <xLeopanther> though the were all quite nice and helpful ^^
[2023-01-06 10:51:53] <%Brandilath> I vaguely remember doing these dungeons around release and it's a bit of a better experience when everyone kind of doesn't know what's going on. No weird speedrun meta.
[2023-01-06 10:51:56] <%+OldManEnglish> Morning Preach - how you feeling about Gw2 with a night to reflect?
[2023-01-06 10:51:56] <%urbish_> think one person knew him, others didnt
[2023-01-06 10:51:58] <wynterdream> gw2 casual community pretty similar to fffxiv's

[2023-01-06 10:52:20] <Frudraglol> this background music reminds my of like skyrim ambiance
[2023-01-06 10:52:25] <Frudraglol> me*
[2023-01-06 10:52:26] <%+OldManEnglish> Yeah Dungeons's aren't really a thing in GW2 - they are outdated content that hasn't been maintained
[2023-01-06 10:52:28] <wynterdream> OMG 4-slot baggies KEKW
[2023-01-06 10:52:29] <%mutopian> @Mordy_the_Mighty he's doing this completely blind at the moment so not reading chat etc - gives him a bit of an authentic 'new-player' experience

[2023-01-06 10:52:34] <+Mordy_the_Mighty> @Frudraglol well it's the same composer

[2023-01-06 10:53:17] <+Mordy_the_Mighty> @Mordy_the_Mighty I can see that! well that will just expose the pretty bad new player experience anyway
[2023-01-06 10:53:18] <mryourmeat> man u made this game look like it isnt dead. cause ur stream viewer is bigger than actual player base LUL

[2023-01-06 10:53:54] <+romann921> You get satchel rewards you need to open in your bags btw

[2023-01-06 10:54:05] <bearberrycheesecake> drama time later?
[2023-01-06 10:54:06] <%Baalroq> Is it the same as yesterday with him not seeing chat?
[2023-01-06 10:54:12] <TheBassett> @mryourmeat Game is still very healthy in population, especially in PvE. But all game modes are active ^^
[2023-01-06 10:54:13] <%Shelana95> alot better
[2023-01-06 10:54:19] <%beskarsilver> @baalroq For now.

[2023-01-06 10:57:17] <Alcarcalimo> @mryourmeat gw2 has had more viewers than that this year, example from the pvp and raid tournament made by Hardstuck community (mightyteapot in chat is one of the leader)

[2023-01-06 11:17:23] <annie_sullivan1962> @samibacsi @tottwriter  i know you long-timers have a lot of them, but you're not telling them the speed you earn it.

[2023-01-06 11:26:21] <+Khellendross> the base story isn't that great till the end, but starting with The Living World stories and carrying into the expansion stories, its way way better

[2023-01-06 11:26:27] <brucemalt> @Ractorious The story in the proper expansion is pretty good. The "living world" is a bit hit and miss for me.
[2023-01-06 11:26:34] <+Frobzel> I got GW1 for christmas after playing GW2 for years, its so weird seeing the charr as evil villains in prophesies

[2023-01-06 11:26:56] <Samibacsi> @annie_sullivan1962 Just for your sake I have checked and I have a total of 463 hours in GW2, that over 10 years comes to 46.3 hours a year, 2 weeks a year means 3.3 hours of playtime a day. I truly am sorry that I do not fit your narrative. And I know you will not accept facts so just stand up from your pc, wash your face, take a walk.
[2023-01-06 11:26:57] <lightriver29> @Hunter_GS GW2 is vastly different experience but I prefer it to 1
[2023-01-06 11:27:03] <twinspirit> @Ractorious Felt like I was always rushing thru the Living World stuff just so I could get to the next expansion KEKW

[2023-01-06 11:27:41] <%BeliCats> @lightriver29 Weirdly enough I played a lot of GW1 and I personally much preferred the level 20 max, and the way that the skills worked to make your own builds, I really missed that in GW2. It was similar, but just not the same
[2023-01-06 11:27:41] <%FrenchFraies> @popdamollyy I don't think it matters for GW2
[2023-01-06 11:27:43] <+Mordy_the_Mighty> @MolotovN not vast enough: they are missing the PLD changes! and all job changes really

[2023-01-06 11:28:01] <%Ractorious> @twinspirit yeah I remember seeing the living world stuff before I quit, the story was more interesting than the base game but it wasn't enough to get me to buy HoT

[2023-01-06 11:28:40] <+Khellendross> yea GW1 is a lobby based rpg. Kinda like D&D Online. Its not a true MMO
[2023-01-06 11:28:43] <+qufad> GW2 has the best open world content imo with meta events
[2023-01-06 11:28:44] <lightriver29> @lightriver29 I didn't play GW1 when it was new, so perhaps I missed the nostalgia and failed to appreciate it enough. I didn't dislike it but couldn't get into it
[2023-01-06 11:28:46] <popdamollyy> @FrenchFraies the region servers are split

[2023-01-06 11:29:25] <%+OldManEnglish> GW1 is basically instanced outside of towns
[2023-01-06 11:29:25] <+Frobzel> The change to in-game cutscenes for the story was a mistake, they should have kept the skippable conversations with the cool painted background
[2023-01-06 11:29:28] <+Khellendross> @Khellendross no, nothing like FFXIV....

[2023-01-06 11:35:15] <MrSym> I do love the art style of the cinematics and stuff in GW2. Really quite unique
[2023-01-06 11:35:20] <xLeopanther> yeah, it's pretty much just write your requirements in the lfg ad. and if someone joins that doesn't match that, you can kick them (or ask them to leave)

[2023-01-06 11:40:17] <%Adventw0lf> @Alcarcalimo Yes, I know what a Revenant is, but not what the class functions as lol  Thank you though
[2023-01-06 11:40:26] <Lctl10> @autolockon same.
[2023-01-06 11:40:28] <Knives77> @Brandonhipster i did :(
[2023-01-06 11:40:38] <Vandristine> well most classes have a heal build or a tank build, you need them for end game content
[2023-01-06 11:40:45] <Cruel_Innocence> @revanton93 there are, but its more in raid's in dungeons tanks and healers have a lesser impact :)
[2023-01-06 11:40:49] <%Geri_0123> @Alcarcalimo there are multiple legends, your utility skills are defined by the equipped legend, you can have two and swap between them in combat
[2023-01-06 11:40:53] VIEWERS: 2 781
[2023-01-06 11:40:56] <Alcarcalimo> if you meant holy trinity then yes it doesnt have it, the closest thing is we have semi 4 roles @revanton93
[2023-01-06 11:40:58] <sleepy_fork> @autolockon it's only true in low level though
[2023-01-06 11:41:01] <+Khellendross> I think the question everyone wants to know is, when is the jumping puzzle only stream
[2023-01-06 11:41:11] <+sYpRo__> looks like fun man

[2023-01-06 11:41:15] <%urbish_> not having the trinity has its downsides i guess
[2023-01-06 11:41:19] <+chaosemperordragoneote> The trap addition in gw2 should be in every mmorpg dungeon
[2023-01-06 11:41:20] <+sYpRo__> is this sub based?

[2023-01-06 11:41:24] <%+LuiBMHunter> no dps meter? no weak auras - no addons - how is this possible!
[2023-01-06 11:41:34] <Trafikk_> thats a break bar... break the bar to increase the damage it takes
[2023-01-06 11:41:35] <MightyTeapot> It's more accurate to say the game has an optional holy trinity, you don't have to play it but it definitely works
[2023-01-06 11:41:42] <Knives77> mike just got slapped
[2023-01-06 11:41:46] <revanton93> @Alcarcalimo i see

[2023-01-06 11:42:06] <+Brandonhipster> yeah why does a mmo have to have a trinity? Dont see it as a downside, just different

[2023-01-06 11:42:42] <+Mordy_the_Mighty> @Brandonhipster the downside is pretty visible in GW2 (though you might argue it's not one): the LFG sucks and there's no automated group maker

[2023-01-06 11:42:52] <Hizirin> I wonder if Preach will decide to try fractals, raids and strikes after level 80
[2023-01-06 11:42:52] <%NomadHook> @Brandonhipster It doesn't need a trinity, but it needs something. Back before healers etc. people just ran the FOTM DPS spec and it wasn't good. Much better now at least

[2023-01-06 11:43:32] <%+mobbeh> @Alcarcalimo Not quite, but elite specializations add more weapon options for the classes
[2023-01-06 11:43:34] <+redcobra_II> @MightyTeapot I actually like that my ranger can choose to be a healer or not, youre not locked into a role
[2023-01-06 11:43:38] <mez_taz> @Adventw0lf no all classes can't use all weapons.

[2023-01-06 11:43:43] <Alcarcalimo> @revanton93 a ''tank'' here dont facetank attacks so others dont get damage, here a tank survive via gear+ passive defence from traits + active defence from skills and movement
[2023-01-06 11:43:46] <+Kruczq> just equip your class' ranged weapon - hammer
[2023-01-06 11:43:59] <+Brandonhipster> one of these i liked rift b/c my rogue could tank
[2023-01-06 11:44:03] <+Mordy_the_Mighty> @MightyTeapot this doesn't mean "no trinity either" though
[2023-01-06 11:44:05] <Hizirin> @Hizirin Dunno, not watching for SWTOR, only for GW2
[2023-01-06 11:44:08] <MightyTeapot> @Lctl10 Well each to their own right, running no heal comps makes it significantly more skillful and in turn more performant if you play well, which I think a lot of players enjoy

[2023-01-06 11:45:39] <Alcarcalimo> Warrior is the class who can use most weapons (Number of usable weapons = 11+3) , Engineer the least ( 4+3) The second number is the weapons from elite specilation classes
[2023-01-06 11:45:40] <simplySouron> @Bohya_ they introduced increased leveling -> just explore map and do stuff, you ll be lvl80 in few days
[2023-01-06 11:45:47] <mez_taz> @Bohya_ the fill the bar stuff is there to point you towards the events. Those are the actual quests of the game

[2023-01-06 11:46:06] <MightyTeapot> @Mordy_the_Mighty No that's not what I mean. You do not need a healer at ALL in gw2 content, or a 'tank' a lot of experienced groups do not run healers, especially in dungeons
[2023-01-06 11:46:11] <Lamedon86> Eir BOOBA
[2023-01-06 11:46:14] <Lctl10> @MightyTeapot Sure, not dissing on whomever enjoys this style :) There's a market to everyone here - and GW2 feels a niche. Just think (personally) that the departure from the Trinity, ensured the game would never reach the heights it could have, as it alianated a lot of players and made coop (specially at launch and before powercreep ) a living hell.

[2023-01-06 11:46:35] <+Grimij> ive missed normalcy
[2023-01-06 11:46:40] <mez_taz> @Bohya_ Originally the game only had the events, but people couldn't find them without the standard ! quests so they made the hearts as a sort of sign post of areas where events are

[2023-01-06 11:47:19] <%urbish_> so is this an easier version of the dungeon he did earlier?
[2023-01-06 11:47:21] <%Adventw0lf> @MightyTeapot The lack of the trinity is one of the things that pushed me away from the game in the end.  I had gotten a warrior to max level but didn't care for WvW and the lack of trinity was annoying for me for dungeons.  So all I had to do was checklist stuff.
[2023-01-06 11:47:30] <mez_taz> @urbish_ yes
[2023-01-06 11:47:31] <%beskarsilver> Prince Rurik, Prince Rurik, the charr are advancing.
[2023-01-06 11:47:38] <simplySouron> @bobil1 not really... they removed this type of "cinematics" and made new, that are entirely different tho
[2023-01-06 11:47:39] <Alcarcalimo> automated wouldnt work @Mordy_the_Mighty you can see how that worked out with public IBS strikes
[2023-01-06 11:47:39] <Hizirin> @MightyTeapot Still, there are people who play the game EXACTLY because it decided to challenge the trinity system
[2023-01-06 11:47:44] <%dramapunk> meant to bring that sword downstairs just keep forgetting
[2023-01-06 11:47:45] <MightyTeapot> @Adventw0lf yeah I think that's a very common experience (especially at the start of gw2 vanilla)
[2023-01-06 11:47:48] <Vandristine> I should some day go and play GW1
[2023-01-06 11:48:02] <Fancyabrew> I think there was a raid released in Heart Of Thorns.. No idea if there was any more after that ?
[2023-01-06 11:48:05] <FortuneCookies> gw2 is a good game, but i liked gw1 so much more PepeHands
[2023-01-06 11:48:07] <wynterdream> Pog
[2023-01-06 11:48:08] <Lctl10> @MightyTeapot I could do without the Vertical progression. But I still Anet for what they did with the crab event that launched ASCENSION gear right after people geared up and were promised no powercreep. If it hadn't been for the outcry when it happened, GW2 would've gone a weird path imho
[2023-01-06 11:48:12] <MightyTeapot> @Hizirin yeah for sure, personally I massively prefer this. Hell my ideal MMO would be a classless system
[2023-01-06 11:48:16] <mez_taz> @Fancyabrew there have been a few more released since then
[2023-01-06 11:48:26] <%NomadHook> @MightyTeapot You mean the 4 Warrior 1 Mesmer meta from Vanilla was a turn off for some people KEKW

[2023-01-06 11:48:39] <Lctl10> @MightyTeapot Of course - and I am glad for that. But instead of becoming a huge MMO, it just fills a niche imho - but I am HAPPY that people like it
[2023-01-06 11:48:44] <Alcarcalimo> @Bohya_ yea hearts was added as away to help ppl who is used to more traditional mmos with vertical progression

[2023-01-06 11:54:23] <viczz88> @Puzzleface i mean, i aint no furry lover....but the humans came and colonized the furry lands first. the furries just want their lands back lel.

[2023-01-06 11:54:29] <Vandristine> Ranger is closer to actual shamans from cultures, using nature spirits
[2023-01-06 11:54:30] <%NomadHook> @Magdelia In gameplay or in theme?

[2023-01-06 11:54:57] <+Arcsu> wheres the dps meter
[2023-01-06 11:55:03] VIEWERS: 3 200
[2023-01-06 11:55:04] <Vandristine> Ele is very hard to play
[2023-01-06 11:55:09] <%Adventw0lf> So what class would you recommend for someone wanting to play ranged?  Like sniper or bowman
[2023-01-06 11:55:14] <Aeridan_> Might makes me right KKona
[2023-01-06 11:55:16] <%+LuiBMHunter> aww Mike scared of the ickle monsters
[2023-01-06 11:55:17] <sleepy_fork> @Magdelia it's one the hardest class in the game, yes
[2023-01-06 11:55:17] <Vandristine> Ranger or Engineer
[2023-01-06 11:55:18] <wynterdream> LUL
[2023-01-06 11:55:22] <BluSubway> necro is a good starting class
[2023-01-06 11:55:23] <%Geri_0123> @Magdelia power weaver is pretty simple, condi scepter one a well (especially if you don't take weave self, but use fire ele)
[2023-01-06 11:55:28] <+Sovitus> @Adventw0lf Ranger 100%
[2023-01-06 11:55:30] <%Puzzleface> ele is hard becase youu gotta know how all 4 specs work and weave them
[2023-01-06 11:55:30] <mez_taz> @Adventw0lf either ranger or deadeye (thief elite spec)
[2023-01-06 11:55:30] <+Mordy_the_Mighty> @Adventw0lf ranger is a pretty reliably good class for new players I'd say
[2023-01-06 11:55:33] <%+TastyGiraffe> @Adventw0lf ranger, engi or warrior
[2023-01-06 11:55:36] <Lalikus> GIGACHAD
[2023-01-06 11:55:37] <Coffeeraptor> @Adventw0lf ranger is your typical bowman class
[2023-01-06 11:55:38] <Khazu9> SMOrc DISPATCH
[2023-01-06 11:55:39] <%NomadHook> @Adventw0lf Any class can do melee and range. Though in endgame content you will mostly be stacking in melee range anyway (for buffs)
[2023-01-06 11:55:40] <MeridianPuppeteer> @Adventw0lf If you want a sniper, Engineer. If you want bowman with pets and traps, then Ranger.
[2023-01-06 11:55:53] <+Chewmii> monkaHmm
[2023-01-06 11:55:54] <lightriver29> @Adventw0lf Thief gets a sniper spec at max level, ranger is only base class that can use longbow, guardian can use longbow and traps as a choice at max level
[2023-01-06 11:55:56] <an_p0> @Adventw0lf thief has elite spec cosplaying sniper rifle. otherwise all classes have range weapons
[2023-01-06 11:55:59] <%Puzzleface> warrior/ranger/necro are good starter classes, simple too understand
[2023-01-06 11:56:02] <%urbish_> monkaHmm
[2023-01-06 11:56:06] <+danhideintree> The best way to think about it is the darker the colour the more danger
[2023-01-06 11:56:08] <BluSubway> mesmer is the most unique class in general MMOs
[2023-01-06 11:56:10] <%Geri_0123> @Puzzleface you can run pweaver without unravel, and you just switch between air/fire, same with condi you cycle fire/earth same as weaponswap on other classes
[2023-01-06 11:56:17] <%+TastyGiraffe> @Adventw0lf Warrior can use Longbow Baseline
[2023-01-06 11:56:19] <%+Curon> Guardian is a nice starter, too
[2023-01-06 11:56:19] <+uk_Cazza> boulder main
[2023-01-06 11:56:20] <%Adventw0lf> @Adventw0lf Ah so it's similar to ESO in that regard.  Ranged being actually ranged is bad.
[2023-01-06 11:56:22] <+Mordy_the_Mighty> @Adventw0lf I'll argue that you don't want to play ranged as a Warrior at least
[2023-01-06 11:56:25] <wynterdream> blue circles usually good. please don't step out of sacred soil PepeHands
[2023-01-06 11:56:30] <%+mobbeh> loot modCheck
[2023-01-06 11:56:31] <lordGualz> loot the chest
[2023-01-06 11:56:32] <IkkisFTW> @Adventw0lf warrrior can use longbow base
[2023-01-06 11:56:36] <+sokriia> open chest omg
[2023-01-06 11:56:39] <+autolockon> Did they tweak balancing cause when I did these back at launch they annihilated us lol
[2023-01-06 11:56:48] <viczz88> why isnt mike opening the chests???
[2023-01-06 11:56:56] <minkishy> U can use your first utility skill to sprint for a long time btw :D
[2023-01-06 11:56:58] <Alcarcalimo> @Magdelia Catalyst (ele elite class) is the closest but still not that similar. Outside of Open world, most combat will be in melee range. Kits are diverse, and often, even a build wit a ranged weapon will end up in melee at some point. Additionally, its Infeasable to go ranged dps in fractals and raids. You need to stay on stack in order to recieve buffs.
[2023-01-06 11:56:58] <%beskarsilver> @autolockon They did.
[2023-01-06 11:56:58] <%dramapunk> no loot, only pgePoorT
[2023-01-06 11:56:59] <shytam> that would make it a point of disinterest won't it
[2023-01-06 11:57:01] <+WhosWill> He looted the chest, though
[2023-01-06 11:57:02] <lightriver29> Warrior can use longbow base but.. it's not great
[2023-01-06 11:57:03] <%Adventw0lf> @autolockon you had the same experience I did lol  Shit was rough
[2023-01-06 11:57:03] <+RaptorAurion> @Adventw0lf true but outside of zerk it's sucks

[2023-01-06 11:57:05] <%NomadHook> @Adventw0lf Yeah, the range of many of the boon and healing skills is pretty small. So if you aren't with the group, you won't get heals and boons
[2023-01-06 11:57:06] <shuu_ke> He looted
[2023-01-06 11:57:09] <+matsuri2057> @autolockon yeah at launch me and my mates got destroyed by the trash and never went back in
[2023-01-06 11:57:09] <+Mordy_the_Mighty> @Adventw0lf sure, and rifle but I don't think they are really good and that you can make a working build around them (especially the rifle)
[2023-01-06 11:57:10] <MeridianPuppeteer> Oh no Mike is missing his two blues and a green. Anyway.
[2023-01-06 11:57:10] <%+TastyGiraffe> @Adventw0lf Rifle on warrior with Beserker is giga burst damage at least when i played,which wa a while ago
[2023-01-06 11:57:11] <%+Andrewsx> @autolockon they were never rebalanced to account for players powercreep over the years
[2023-01-06 11:57:17] <+Nimro_> @autolockon they game now and back at launch is like 2 different games now
[2023-01-06 11:57:19] <marajango> which server is Mike playing on?

[2023-01-06 11:59:17] <Hizirin> @PraesidiumPT Fun fact - the difference in damage outut between a casual player and skilled one can be even  10 times as much, with the same gear

[2023-01-06 12:14:59] <GFreenD1> it overlays on it self your old stacks have duration individually it does not refresh

[2023-01-06 12:16:56] <%+Azther090> Ill be honest my least favorite thing about GW2 is the whole lack of gameplay changing since each class really only has move tied to weapons they have equipped instead of a level system

[2023-01-06 12:18:15] <mez_taz> @Hizirin the game doesn't hold your hand a lot which means you can miss a lot of stuff
[2023-01-06 12:18:17] <%Puzzleface> @NomadHook did first proper playthrough last year, some newbie stuff got added like base raptor for new players, adventure guide is a good addittion. still tthe biggestt thing they need to do is remove paying for lw story and bundle it witth xpacs

[2023-01-06 12:19:38] <%NomadHook> @Alcarcalimo True, but I think a big issue is that it is not enough to teach, you have to reinforce it. Unfortunately things like combo fields, break bars, etc. Get taught and then aren't necessary to get through the base content

[2023-01-06 12:20:47] <+Mordy_the_Mighty> @Alcarcalimo it doesn't help that imho combo fields are kinda "bad" and often ignorable, break bars on the other hand need that focus/teaching!
[2023-01-06 12:20:49] <lightriver29> I can outrun a Cen-taar! I don't get why they pronounce centaur so wrong

[2023-01-06 12:36:01] <+Brandonhipster> oh we did it when there was no mounts
[2023-01-06 12:36:02] <+Xadia> Any boosters?
[2023-01-06 12:36:04] <thavleifrim> honestly i doubt you will get a flying mount
[2023-01-06 12:36:06] <Trafikk_> these zones were all made and designed way before we had mounts... so all designed to get to the points without the use of mounts
[2023-01-06 12:36:07] <%urbish_> skipper Madge
[2023-01-06 12:36:08] <DeityRevert> rabbits can't fly
[2023-01-06 12:36:11] <brucemalt> @mez_taz I don't mind it, most jumping puzzles that are "serious" forbid mounts.
[2023-01-06 12:36:12] <%NomadHook> @mez_taz Yeah, unfortunately they had to. You couldn't keep up with mounted players during events, and people were just getting taxi'd to the first POF story instance to get the mount early (which is not ideal)
[2023-01-06 12:36:12] <OxyProzo> skipping vistas hurts

[2023-01-06 12:36:57] <mez_taz> @NomadHook they honestly just should have made mounts unusable in core tyria

[2023-01-06 12:37:20] <%Geri_0123> Not really
[2023-01-06 12:37:26] <wynterdream> for newcomer yes 250g is a lot
[2023-01-06 12:37:27] <kimbtw> HUH
[2023-01-06 12:37:28] <secretskritt> its not
[2023-01-06 12:37:28] <Hizirin> @muzuq It's... an amount not to be taken lightly
[2023-01-06 12:37:30] <0rektquiem> depends who you ask
[2023-01-06 12:37:30] <nimfuze> For the average player it is
[2023-01-06 12:37:36] <%Geri_0123> you can make around 20g/hour in a metatrain
[2023-01-06 12:37:36] <%Whit3Tig3R_> @muzuq it is
[2023-01-06 12:37:38] <+xNaiis> @muzuq 10-15h of fishing
[2023-01-06 12:37:40] <+LamaPuppy> for most newer players 250g is a lot
[2023-01-06 12:37:41] <%NomadHook> @muzuq Yes and no. Depends heavily on who you are and what content you do

[2023-01-06 12:37:57] <+LamaPuppy> over time you pick up ways to make more gold and can accumulate it faster
[2023-01-06 12:37:58] <@%Methuzahla> 250 can be quite a lot
[2023-01-06 12:37:59] <somename91> LUL what is that hobbling walk lmao
[2023-01-06 12:38:03] <Coffeeraptor> for the average player 250 is a lot because making money in this game can be tricky if you dont know how
[2023-01-06 12:38:04] <%Geri_0123> daily t4 is like 20gish, daily strikes are good gold too
[2023-01-06 12:38:06] <secretskritt> RIBA farm 20g/h so its not alot
[2023-01-06 12:38:16] <かわいい名前 (defnotj4)> @nimfuze i think i did skyscale in like 5 games and i hated myself for it

[2023-01-06 12:38:26] <%Shelana95> MSQ time ?
[2023-01-06 12:38:29] <Hizirin> you gotta know HOW to sell stuff if you want to profit from farms anyway
[2023-01-06 12:38:32] <PaeToWin> @Geri_0123 daily T4 are completely out of reach for newer players
[2023-01-06 12:38:34] <+LamaPuppy> "making gold" is very much a learned skill in gw2, almost like learning a rotation/class lol
[2023-01-06 12:38:35] <Batresh> I played gw2 for so many hours. but they brought the game to ruins these developers. theres no variety to pvp. normal dungeons are dead, only fractals left besides raids
[2023-01-06 12:38:42] <jesbro64> what games are slated for MMO January besides GW2?
[2023-01-06 12:38:47] <@%Methuzahla> think skyscale was me obsessively checking how many of the currencies I had every day lol
[2023-01-06 12:38:48] <%FrenchFraies> Someone watching over on a throne lol
[2023-01-06 12:38:51] <Hizirin> Or you just count on getting a lucky expensive drop that you can sell for a large price at trading post

[2023-01-06 12:39:06] <Hizirin> or you do ecto gambling
[2023-01-06 12:39:08] <%+Sprakenheit> It's the boat salesman
[2023-01-06 12:39:08] <nimfuze> @Batresh So true... a shame thoughj, game has so much potential
[2023-01-06 12:39:12] <%NomadHook> @nimfuze I love my Skyscale, but I highly recommend doing new expacs without it the first time. I went through EOD without using flying mounts and it felt so much better IMO

[2023-01-06 12:45:09] <+LamaPuppy> @Prevention6 Yeah it felt like they put most of the effort into the meta/strikes and not as much into the story.  Hopefully the next living world has more meat on it.

[2023-01-06 12:47:11] <+Mordy_the_Mighty> @Prevention6 it felt too much out of nowhere though, the issue in EoD is that quality plunges as you advance the story I feel (lack of time probably)

[2023-01-06 12:48:04] <%NomadHook> @Prevention6 Every expac seems to be that way. The pacing is always off. Not sure if having everything voice acted limits their ability to put out stories that have enough room to breath.

[2023-01-06 12:48:22] <+Mordy_the_Mighty> @Prevention6 Li is a good example, he started like a good villain with potential,  then later on, nope, he's just a two notes racist dude without any subtelty and we'll beat him in a fight and be done with it

[2023-01-06 12:48:34] <Wanya2007> @Prevention6 yeah ice brood saga into end of dragons was though for them suddenly to build a new expansion while also loosing 100 employees

[2023-01-06 12:49:12] <%Geri_0123> @OnFrame Bjora marches was nice, but what came after was meh
[2023-01-06 12:49:17] <Hizirin> @Prevention6 I can see Li returning in some manner, the Purist storyline seems to be heavily hinted at to go further

[2023-01-06 12:49:31] <hubbathegrate> Do mosnter defences varry Wildly, or why does he suddenly do damage in the low 100s now when he was doing 500-1000 in the dungeon?
[2023-01-06 12:49:38] <Goraka91> Problem with GW2 is they change who the main writer is like every 6 months KEKW
[2023-01-06 12:49:48] <lightriver29> There are few areas in any game that have ever captured their intended ambience like Bjora Marches
[2023-01-06 12:49:53] [Notification] Belths subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 33 months!

[2023-01-06 12:50:03] <ridok96> @hubbathegrate you scale down to the zone level if you're above it

[2023-01-06 12:50:18] <+Prevention6> i really liked drizzlewood coast and bjora marches there was a lot to do
[2023-01-06 12:50:26] <+LamaPuppy> @Prevention6 yeah Li had such potential, and honestly I think their "small story" work is the best and most interesting.  The internal conflicts, subterfuge stuff.
[2023-01-06 12:50:26] <nufulini> is story a big thing in gw2? never played
[2023-01-06 12:50:28] <wynterdream> bunneh!
[2023-01-06 12:50:36] <Hizirin> I love the Bjora Marches theme, absolutely knocked out of the park
[2023-01-06 12:50:39] <sleepy_fork> @nufulini yeah
[2023-01-06 12:50:40] <%+TottWriter> @nufulini It's optional but a large focus
[2023-01-06 12:50:40] <+Criti> @Goraka91 thats not true what
[2023-01-06 12:50:42] <numinuminumnumnum> @hubbathegrate Not just zone level but parts of the zone got different levels set to it
[2023-01-06 12:50:43] <+xNaiis> @Prevention6 palavan was best meta
[2023-01-06 12:50:50] <Hizirin> not a big fan of Drizzlewood Coast, but felt like a proper warzone
[2023-01-06 12:50:51] <hubbathegrate> Huh I guess I'm used to the xiv "yes I want to sync" kind o thting for that
[2023-01-06 12:50:52] <sniffsc> @nufulini Yes - but its not that amazing imo
[2023-01-06 12:50:52] <0rektquiem> @nufulini it's decent
[2023-01-06 12:50:55] <%NomadHook> @Prevention6 I liked the move to one map every 2 episodes, rather than 1 per. Those zones feel more fleshed out
[2023-01-06 12:50:57] <%+Delthanin> This game looks so fun when I watch Zepla or Preach play it, but keep having issues getting into it.  Maybe just need to keep chugging to higher levels for it to "click"
[2023-01-06 12:50:58] <hubbathegrate> but it makes sense
[2023-01-06 12:50:59] <Streamers_Psychosis> not when i played the story lines just dropped and you were told to go do something else
[2023-01-06 12:51:01] <Mesis> @nufulini not really. There is a lot of it but the quality isnt proably as good as FF, maybe on WoW level at best

[2023-01-06 12:51:20] <Goraka91> @Criti I'm exaggerating, but like every expansion and LW has a different writer
[2023-01-06 12:51:20] <lightriver29> @nufulini There's a very long and varied story that starts t the beginning and goes right through all the content. It's encouraged to go through it but not necessary. Some of it is phenomenal and some of it is really poor
[2023-01-06 12:51:29] <+bound006> revent hands down one of the most fun classes to play
[2023-01-06 12:51:30] <Siggi_EMP> BIG XP Pog
[2023-01-06 12:51:36] <%+TottWriter> GW2 story jumps up in quality after core. It's never FF levels, but its strenght is that it's gameplay oriented
[2023-01-06 12:51:38] <Hizirin> My biggest problem with FF is that it literally forces you to do the story to progress
[2023-01-06 12:51:45] <+Criti> @Goraka91 they kinda rotate, but people like Conor been here for years, he left recently
[2023-01-06 12:51:47] <0rektquiem> @nufulini true @lightriver29
[2023-01-06 12:51:53] <Streamers_Psychosis> did you ever find your sibling that ran away to the circus lmao
[2023-01-06 12:51:55] <Gusty331> @Delthanin for me, it was at higher levels, doing endgame big events with like 50 poeple evry events. Was so fun
[2023-01-06 12:51:56] <%Talia417> Hey preach and chat o/
[2023-01-06 12:52:01] <%+TottWriter> There are some absolutely mechanically fantastic story steps in GW2
[2023-01-06 12:52:04] <+LamaPuppy> @Delthanin for sure the game gets better at max, but that's true of many mmos.  Personally I like the "go wherever, do what you want" way of questing but it's not for everyone, some feel lost
[2023-01-06 12:52:06] <lightriver29> Even if you don't like the story of GW2 I would recommend playing through it for the unique areas you will get to explore and the actual fun of the gameplay
[2023-01-06 12:52:11] <trixo_zawun> @nufulini if you pay attention to the lore, and dont rush, is quite good. it's alos fully voice acted.
[2023-01-06 12:52:12] <+Kruczq> has Preach tried action camera?
[2023-01-06 12:52:18] <Goraka91> @Criti Like idk the quality varies so damn much
[2023-01-06 12:52:23] <blueburb> visual pollution wars 2 Pog
[2023-01-06 12:52:24] <OnFrame> @OnFrame Drizzlewood is great as well, but last episode, some DRM's were ok, but story wise it was pure rushed garbage
[2023-01-06 12:52:29] <numinuminumnumnum> @nufulini Personally I'd put GW2 between FF14 and WoW, it has some fantastic moments with cutscenes and such that feels like a FF14 moment, but not as well thought out all the time, post PoF living story feels like FF14 top story moments tho
[2023-01-06 12:52:50] <Streamers_Psychosis> has mike tried WvWvW yet? is that even still a thing in the game?
[2023-01-06 12:52:54] <lightriver29> If overall Wow's story is a 3/10, FF's story is a 9/10, GW2 is a 6-7/10
[2023-01-06 12:52:59] <%NomadHook> @lightriver29 For me GW2 suffers from a similar issue to WoW. Amazing lore and world, but middle of the road story telling (moment to moment)
[2023-01-06 12:53:00] <Coffeeraptor> @Delthanin i had the same problem. I started to have really fun after changing the class and the unlocking elite specs
[2023-01-06 12:53:08] <%Eeisal> GW2 has a pretty cool levelling experience, but I think it kind of falls short everywhere else. ArenaNet abandoned too many modes for newer things, and then they abandoned those as well.
[2023-01-06 12:53:09] <Wanya2007> @Streamers_Psychosis no but yes its still not dead lol

[2023-01-06 12:53:21] <+LamaPuppy> @nufulini yeah I'm in the same boat.  It's not the best story, but it's coherent for the most part, fun, and has a pretty clear direction
[2023-01-06 12:53:22] <Plenyx> sure PepeLaugh
[2023-01-06 12:53:26] <+Ghede__> KappaCool clearly
[2023-01-06 12:53:26] <0rektquiem> @nufulini yeah i like wow lore better than gw2's but gw2 storytelling is superior
[2023-01-06 12:53:32] <simplySouron> @Hizirin gw2 kinda forces you too, but you can do a workaround and +- skip the story (need story to open instance, but you can just stop the story and explore without doing it)
[2023-01-06 12:53:37] <OnFrame> Gw2 open world dynamic events even at launch are way ahead of FF14 and WoW, which is sad ;/ it really makes me play open world more
[2023-01-06 12:53:42] <%+Delthanin> @Coffeeraptor Huh, I'm not even familiar with what "elite specs" are.  I'll need to look that up
[2023-01-06 12:53:47] <0rektquiem> @nufulini not in all parts tho
[2023-01-06 12:53:48] <+pacotaco91> Man i hope mike makes it tthrough some of HOT at least first time in tarir is so good
[2023-01-06 12:53:50] <+Mordy_the_Mighty> @lightriver29 honetly I think it's just that those studios/teams don't value story as much as the FF teams do, so they change writers too much, they don't give the story the budget to express itself etc...
[2023-01-06 12:53:58] <lightriver29> @lightriver29 Yeah I would put GW2 ahead of Wow there though
[2023-01-06 12:53:58] <realsylos> Chat, does he know yet that more people = more champions = more loot in a long event like this?
[2023-01-06 12:54:03] <Dreion> Has he seen a world boss yet chat?
[2023-01-06 12:54:04] <Streamers_Psychosis> Some must fight so that all may be free or w/e
[2023-01-06 12:54:11] <niveous_a> GW2's meta events are far better then any open world content XIV or wow has
[2023-01-06 12:54:15] <%Rucent> monkaSTEER

[2023-01-06 12:54:37] <Hizirin> FF story might be epic and grandiose etc, but it still feels like a jrpg fanfic for me and I'm telling this as someone who like japanese stuff - but FF XIV just throws me off
[2023-01-06 12:54:41] <OnFrame> Final EoD META is the most epic open world content I've ever played
[2023-01-06 12:54:42] <lightriver29> @lightriver29 Yeah I can't see GW2's story ever being as good as FF but I think it is well worth experiencing
[2023-01-06 12:54:42] <%Geri_0123> he already forgot about stab
[2023-01-06 12:54:43] <+Brandonhipster> yeah cant wait for him to see the BIG events
[2023-01-06 12:54:48] <Coffeeraptor> @Delthanin they are basically subclasses that changes the gamestyle. For example ranger gets the druid spec in the first expansion which is a healer
[2023-01-06 12:54:48] <+Mordy_the_Mighty> @niveous_a I still like the Bozja CE more than any open world even GW2 has, but that's just because FF does boss fights better than GW2
[2023-01-06 12:54:48] <%spejspag> True, if we talking open world WoW and FFXIV have no start to GW2
[2023-01-06 12:54:50] <OnFrame> 50man bossfight which can fail if people slack off
[2023-01-06 12:54:57] <niveous_a> yeah its so fucking good @OnFrame

[2023-01-06 12:55:39] <wynterdream> my standards are a bit higher and imo FF is 8/10 at best... was kinda disappointed with EW. they can't kill anyone anymore bc playerbase would riot. that hamstrings writers A LOT imo
[2023-01-06 12:55:40] <UmmSenna> @Brandonhipster Tequatl?
[2023-01-06 12:55:43] <+Mordy_the_Mighty> @Brandonhipster Tequatl right?
[2023-01-06 12:55:43] <Adrien_Hantinous> I think gw2 story is not that good but with a very good delivery whereas FFXIV has awesome story, but porrly delivered
[2023-01-06 12:55:44] <+tyrew0rm> I play wow for instanced PvE and GW2 for open world, dragons stand remains my favourite MMO expericence
[2023-01-06 12:55:45] <+Brandonhipster> yes
[2023-01-06 12:55:47] <+Kruczq> @iamnakano dungeons and raids is the pve endgame of gw2
[2023-01-06 12:55:47] <%+TottWriter> ohno
[2023-01-06 12:55:50] <%NomadHook> I just wish I could see anything in large metas. Really need to be able to turn off peoples backpacks + infusions (and more of the spell effects)
[2023-01-06 12:55:53] <Garland_42> tequatl? not enough level yet
[2023-01-06 12:55:53] <%Geri_0123> @Brandonhipster level 65

[2023-01-06 12:55:54] <%+TottWriter> he bout to be trippin
[2023-01-06 12:55:58] <0rektquiem> @iamnakano it has raids though? and fractals? and strikes?
[2023-01-06 12:56:01] <waggamsn> oh this is hard event
[2023-01-06 12:56:02] <かわいい名前 (defnotj4)> @wynterdream deaths = story KEKL
[2023-01-06 12:56:04] <+GroovyGengar> @iamnakano there is some dcent endgame content in GW2 though in terms of fractals/Strikes and raids
[2023-01-06 12:56:19] <+bound006> tbh gw2 starts in the endgame. so much amazing stuff to do. the core game is a bit outdated
[2023-01-06 12:56:20] <+Mordy_the_Mighty> @wynterdream honestly, they can kill who they want. It's pretty much that the current writers do not really believe in killing for shock value or so
[2023-01-06 12:56:21] <+aburii_> @iamnakano go look up some of the new strike mission challenge modes on youtube there is instanced pve content
[2023-01-06 12:56:21] <+Flit1> Did Mike get just the base game or the collection?
[2023-01-06 12:56:22] <wynterdream> @wynterdream that's intellectual dishonesty.
[2023-01-06 12:56:26] <OnFrame> @iamnakano it has m+ like system and raids along with single raid boss instances called strikes  they all are done to this day, even the very first released one, as gear power never was increased passed games release
[2023-01-06 12:56:30] <Lctl10> @wynterdream I disagree - you dont need to kill someone or anyone to have it be a good story
[2023-01-06 12:56:34] <%NomadHook> @iamnakano Raids and Fractals have been largely abandoned. Last new fractal was 2020. But strikes  are getting more frequent updates
[2023-01-06 12:56:34] <iamnakano> oh ok ill look into it, all i saw last time it was on open world basically
[2023-01-06 12:56:35] <eye356> damn, i played this alot when it was new but it has aged
[2023-01-06 12:56:49] <numinuminumnumnum> @iamnakano Fractals, raids and strikes are kinda lackluster, my main gripe with anything above 5 people is the game is clearly not designed for it and its combat feels like a mess, fractals is very fun tho, but limiting, not enough content to carry 5 man
[2023-01-06 12:56:52] <Shaklug> gw2 story is like adventuring with the scions, but then they realized they can't afford the most expensive va's, so you end up adventuring with hoary boulder and the b team
[2023-01-06 12:56:53] <OnFrame> @iamnakano but release amount of new endgame pve content is DEFFINETELY slower than ff14 or wow
[2023-01-06 12:56:57] <+GroovyGengar> Think the hardest part is just getting used to there being no vertical progression in GW2, you buy your gear, and then you're pretty much set, with gear improvements there providing smaller improvements
[2023-01-06 12:56:57] <%+SteelfurLive> @eye356 so has every mmo on the market tbh
[2023-01-06 12:56:58] <nufulini> Imo to have a fun mmo you need to have optional story, I love the story of 14 but imo it would of been better as a single player game. And the fact that with every expansions the time it takes for new players to get to endgame take longer and longer is quite bad
[2023-01-06 12:57:01] <Coffeeraptor> i love how nobody mentioned world vs world yet FeelsBadMan
[2023-01-06 12:57:02] <Alcarcalimo> last time early 2012? @iamnakano
[2023-01-06 12:57:03] <+pacotaco91> Theres arguably more evergeen endgame pve content like raids etc in gw2 then wow tho. Wow ditches its old content inbetween patches
[2023-01-06 12:57:05] <+GroovyGengar> Especially if you come from FF14/WoW etc
[2023-01-06 12:57:07] <%Eeisal> @wynterdream They literally killed characters in the story though KEKW
[2023-01-06 12:57:07] <+cenwenki> you high :D
[2023-01-06 12:57:09] <raxus502> Use the force Mike.
[2023-01-06 12:57:11] <djedeleste> @Hizirin The ooint of the FF14 to me is not how grandiose or epic, but how well developped it is with consistent characters that have depth and evolve and really implicate the players. Whether friendlies or ennemies, it's worth more for the details and how it's done rather than what the big danger actually is
[2023-01-06 12:57:16] <thebignosejohn> lol
[2023-01-06 12:57:17] <Hizirin> @iamnakano They never stated that this content is dead though, strikes were mentioned to be a ramp up to raids proper
[2023-01-06 12:57:18] <iamnakano> @Alcarcalimo yeah lmao
[2023-01-06 12:57:19] <wynterdream> players basically know some NPCs are not killable. so no impact even if they "die"

[2023-01-06 12:57:53] <Ostwig> @tyrew0rm GW2 has Raids and Fractals (kinda m+ dungeons), what it lacks is endless gear treadmill if that is your thing. Once you have ascended gear you cannot get more power, legendary gear has same amount of stats.
[2023-01-06 12:58:02] <%+TottWriter> Strikes have really stepped up since IBS tbh
[2023-01-06 12:58:04] <%NomadHook> @Coffeeraptor You mean that mode that half the players just take a camp and hide in base gathering pips... I loved WvW, but the pip system destroyed it for me personally
[2023-01-06 12:58:16] <Hizirin> EOD strikes are pog
[2023-01-06 12:58:17] <TheReyruls> !transplant
[2023-01-06 12:58:25] <Lctl10> @wynterdream again, Death != story relevance or importance.  You don't need death to be present to change characters and experiences.
[2023-01-06 12:58:26] <OnFrame> and also all this lvl content is Vanilla only basically, it's crazy how better game becomes once you get access to literally all updated game had at once @lvl80 xD
[2023-01-06 12:58:42] <Hizirin> also Old Lion's Court release after EOD was really nice to blind progress with my group
[2023-01-06 12:58:45] <+bound006> @Ostwig WoW literally introduced m+ because of gw2 fractals
[2023-01-06 12:58:47] <+pacotaco91> Mike do the story and get to HOT please

[2023-01-06 12:59:00] <+Brandonhipster> I loved WvW when it first came out. I remember our guild train to be good in WvW
[2023-01-06 12:59:01] <numinuminumnumnum> @Ostwig Pretty much this, you play the game to play it, once you've done that you play for cosmetics, but if you got your character kited out to look how you want and you've done that content enough (which don't get updated or new stuff that often), you've hit a stop
[2023-01-06 12:59:03] <KeyrisNyan> drunk toxic strimmer
[2023-01-06 12:59:04] <wynterdream> FF story sells on the emotional impact. story-wise, vanilla swtor is still miles better. but if you make well-loved characters basically plot armour proof, whenever they "die" it's just a meme
[2023-01-06 12:59:17] <Hizirin> ^ this

[2023-01-06 12:59:44] <%NomadHook> @Ostwig Yeah, it doesn't need a treadmill, but waiting 2+ years for a new fractal sucks

[2023-01-06 12:59:50] <wynterdream> i love the emotional impact of ff MSQ... but they really killed that

[2023-01-06 12:59:56] <Lctl10> @wynterdream bruh. Good you like Swtor story, but their tropes are vastly different. neither is superior to each other. But you keep insisting that for a story to be good, people need to die, and I fundamentely disagree with that
[2023-01-06 13:00:00] <+BlueBeast33> Has he been introduced to any jumping puzzles yet?

[2023-01-06 13:00:04] <+Mordy_the_Mighty> a lot of people were pretty devastated by EW story at the and when some characters were "missing", even if as a player you knew they weren't gone, the writing still had impact
[2023-01-06 13:00:05] <%+YuushaEX> we did it
[2023-01-06 13:00:06] <Coffeeraptor> @NomadHook Organized wvw group fights are really fun but i agree the gameplay outside of that is pretty bad
[2023-01-06 13:00:09] <Alcarcalimo> yea basically strikes is like final fantasy raids @iamnakano single boss encounters
[2023-01-06 13:00:13] <+Mordy_the_Mighty> you don't *need* to kill the main characters
[2023-01-06 13:00:13] <@%+Nupss> NODDERS might = right

[2023-01-06 13:00:41] <OnFrame> biggest issue of FF14 for me is it feels like Exposition simulator, characters constantly feed you some nonsense, very little is reserved to build actual chatacters, and it kills it for me
[2023-01-06 13:00:42] <Lctl10> @wynterdream im reading what you're writing...
[2023-01-06 13:00:49] <djedeleste> @wynterdream Meh.Whil eit is true, i personnally attach a lot more omportance t the details and how they keep stuff alive and integrate it even after the big events ended, like it would in a real world, rather than to just the big heroes

[2023-01-06 13:01:02] <0rektquiem> @Coffeeraptor  pvp is nice though, and open world events and metas

[2023-01-06 13:01:19] <numinuminumnumnum> @Ostwig I've played GW2 since its release up until recent xpac, almost non-stop, I'm a bit of an exception in that park, and I still got more I can do, but what's left doesn't appeal me as much, I still love the game, tho I wish they never gave up on normal dungeon releases to do fractals or less fractal for strikes, not a fan of strikes much
[2023-01-06 13:01:19] <%Eeisal> @wynterdream Nah, I do think your opinion is bad when it comes to the writing.

[2023-01-06 13:02:33] <Hizirin> @UnionJack89 They ditched Soule after doing music for core and took Maclaine Diemer, Lena Raine and Stan LePard, and their stuff is much better than Soule's imo

[2023-01-06 13:02:47] <dumat1479> @Preachlfw you have like months of playing content till you reach flying or boats. Unless you specifically go to those things and focus on them

[2023-01-06 13:19:37] <BaronSolace> @Preachlfw The following items are now dyeable: Fat Chocobo Head
[2023-01-06 13:19:38] <KampfKeks122> That door gets destroyed so often I think they get a discount

[2023-01-06 13:20:03] <Theta_Bug> IBS feels like a bit of a dip from s4, but i've heard EoD is good
[2023-01-06 13:20:04] <%+itshoneyyellow> @Methuzahla YES!!
[2023-01-06 13:20:15] <+bound006> mike press V more

[2023-01-06 13:20:25] <%NomadHook> @Theta_Bug Miles better than IBS, but not as good as S4 IMO
[2023-01-06 13:20:25] <%+ArmoryCZ> -2 gates ending
[2023-01-06 13:20:26] <Shaklug> Well with how fast they fixed that bridge...
[2023-01-06 13:20:27] <Lavelllannn> GOLEM RUSH!!!!
[2023-01-06 13:20:34] <ophypo> @Theta_Bug IBS indeed kinda suck, but EoD is fantastic
[2023-01-06 13:20:34] <Hizirin> @Theta_Bug EOD is mixed but if you were invested in the dragon saga it's satisfying, minus a bit or two
[2023-01-06 13:20:37] <@%Methuzahla> wow Mike. You just cost them 2 gates
[2023-01-06 13:20:40] <%Puzzleface> @Theta_Bug IBS is good until like chapter 4 when it drops the ball hard. s4 is good all the way through
[2023-01-06 13:20:52] <revanton93> first the bridge now the gate. sheeesh
[2023-01-06 13:20:52] <%Mallas2> really looking forward to preach seeing shatter and tequatl if he makes it that far
[2023-01-06 13:20:57] <OnFrame> Season 4 was golden age of Living story, great lore, best Raid wings, awesome maps and metas
[2023-01-06 13:20:59] <@%Methuzahla> I love that Grawl jump in like Lord of the Dance
[2023-01-06 13:21:06] <Theta_Bug> Yea, i'm at the last chapter of IBS, and i can't see this wrapping up well enough in the few quests left
[2023-01-06 13:21:07] <@%Methuzahla> its like being at the ballet
[2023-01-06 13:21:10] <hal2210> pof is great
[2023-01-06 13:21:12] <%+ArmoryCZ> well time to destroy the walls aswell
[2023-01-06 13:21:14] <%Puzzleface> dragonfall is a bis zone
[2023-01-06 13:21:14] <+Pazy160> I really enjoyed the first 2/3rds of Icebrood Saga. Some of the best maps in the game for me. I have to assume the issue with the end of it has something to do with suddenly starting an expansion.
[2023-01-06 13:21:21] <Theta_Bug> But i've loved the game so far
[2023-01-06 13:21:22] <Hizirin> @OnFrame Best raid for me was still Bastion of the Penitent
[2023-01-06 13:21:30] VIEWERS: 3 494
[2023-01-06 13:21:31] <@%Methuzahla> I love the Dragonfall meta NODDERS
[2023-01-06 13:21:36] <Hizirin> But I'm a sucker for Mursaat stuff, so...
[2023-01-06 13:21:38] <%NomadHook> @OnFrame Agreed. We got everything. Raids, Fractals, Maps, Good Story, Mounts, etc.
[2023-01-06 13:21:46] <MidasPL> Oh, just woke up to see Preach playing best class in the game ^^
[2023-01-06 13:21:48] <%+TottWriter> @Pazy160 Yeah the devs confirmed that halfway through IBS development they were told to wrap it up and shift to EoD
[2023-01-06 13:21:51] <Theta_Bug> Played it like ff, stood in the current expansion/season and unlocked as many things as i could, then moved to the next
[2023-01-06 13:21:51] <%Saint473> wait was that the death scream? XD
[2023-01-06 13:21:57] <+aereton> best meta is still AB, god the music

[2023-01-06 13:22:22] <+obag13> hey preach! dont know if you are aware but ff14 just did this to the new patch... WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR THE KWEH!        The following items are now dyeable: Chocobo Mask Chocobo Suit Racing Chocobo Mask Fat Chocobo Head @Preachlfw
[2023-01-06 13:22:37] <numinuminumnumnum> @TottWriter Yeah, why IBS starts really good, got so much potential, but after first time we meet Jormag, it falls off after it real quick

[2023-01-06 13:22:42] <+aereton> mordy is amazing too, I just wish it was harder like for us plebs back in the days
[2023-01-06 13:22:43] <%Puzzleface> drizzlewood is good here and there
[2023-01-06 13:22:46] <Taufanxz> he not reading chat lol
[2023-01-06 13:22:46] <%+Captain_Papaya> @aereton Anything by Lena Raine Kreygasm
[2023-01-06 13:22:52] <+Pazy160> @TottWriter It makes me hopefully for the next living world. I didnt enjoy EoD that much but Im hoping thats partly the compressed development.
[2023-01-06 13:22:55] <Hizirin> I'm really sad they didn't make Battl on the Breachmaker into a proper meta event, the music there is still one of the best in Season 1
[2023-01-06 13:23:06] <%Puzzleface> IBS prologue has some really funny events with the metal band etc
[2023-01-06 13:23:09] <%NomadHook> @aereton Remember when the islands getting eaten was actually a threat. Was good fun
[2023-01-06 13:23:09] <Silverwist> Is there a class that uses blood magic of some sorts?
[2023-01-06 13:23:16] <%+TottWriter> @Pazy160 Same. I'm like, not fully on the hype train, but I want to believe...

[2023-01-06 14:21:42] <hubbathegrate> @Mordy_the_Mighty I assume so, what it doesn't cost them anything and having him run into barriers for no reason doesn't help advertising the game so...

[2023-01-06 14:22:09] <+Mordy_the_Mighty> @Mordy_the_Mighty ah he was gifted the game by ANet? then yeah he probably has everything
[2023-01-06 14:22:12] <Krystalchan> its cause you can lvl pretty much anywhere tbh
[2023-01-06 14:22:15] <SoFisht> @thre3_b_ there's no GCD. everything is based on animations a la an action game
[2023-01-06 14:22:18] <skryah> a good player does literally 20x more damage than an average player when they understand the game well, this can be an upside or a downside up to your own opinion @thre3_b_

[2023-01-06 14:22:41] <+donmarelio> @Alcarcalimo oh, I'm aware. just saying he's deciding based on criteria that are irrelevant, but oh well. such are the design flaws of core story

[2023-01-06 14:22:47] <+MsBungle> Hope he plays long enough to unlock gliding and the real jumping this mount can do
[2023-01-06 14:22:48] <skryah> @skryah yeah I'm not sure if it's still the case but it was the case around 2 years ago still
[2023-01-06 14:22:52] <+Mordy_the_Mighty> @skryah maybe, it's probably only 10x more damage now but there still is a huge difference
[2023-01-06 14:22:53] <+thre3_b_> @aereton oh cool. I’ve not played yet. I might give it a go
[2023-01-06 14:22:55] <Alcarcalimo> @thre3_b_ this is the darksouls of MMOs, it has downded state as bordelands, and should be played kinda like Skyrim
[2023-01-06 14:23:08] <SoFisht> @skryah recent balance has massively buffed auto chains to resolve this particular issue.

[2023-01-06 14:23:33] <SoFisht> it's definitely still a large gulf, but auto attack andies arent completely useless anymore. especially on classes like mech

[2023-01-06 14:23:38] <+aereton> @thre3_b_ trying it out won't cost anything, it's quite a niche game tho not gonna lie

[2023-01-06 15:04:36] <+Kruczq> There used to be magic find gear afaik but they have removed it long time ago and replaced with this system
[2023-01-06 15:04:41] <MidasPL> @Wildonfire Unless you're crafting legendary :P
[2023-01-06 15:04:42] <+Moonderon> yooo how long you been playing this? never tried this game! i dont think i will tbh but watching you play it is nice to see
[2023-01-06 15:04:46] <%+Bashiel> @realsylos yeah
[2023-01-06 15:04:46] <Arty93> I find the GW2 bag slots so hard to use

[2023-01-06 15:05:00] <+Mordy_the_Mighty> technically, you can reach a luck cap and you need the luck items for some legendaries, if really needed but that's super late game considerations
[2023-01-06 15:05:05] <numinuminumnumnum> @Kruczq Yeah it was so horrible, people gimping themselves out and making their group carry them just to get more loot
