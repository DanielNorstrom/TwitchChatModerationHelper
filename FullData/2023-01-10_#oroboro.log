[2023-01-10 03:10:56] <SuburbanSocrates> @erogenousjones That's the name of the stuffed mouse toy given to Zagreus by Thanos. You can use him to summon Thanos to do big damage 1/2/3 times per run (depending on upgrade level.)
[2023-01-10 03:10:58] <+meatmaaan> @Pallydan9K thats called the pact of punishment
[2023-01-10 03:11:04] <%+N7_Indra> @Pallydan9K Thats what the Heat system is for. You can make the game as hard as you want
[2023-01-10 03:11:18] <%Illuna_Meira> @pallydan9k he has more heat and this run is not good for clearing rooms rn I think
[2023-01-10 03:11:30] <@%$Pallydan9K> Well the lore seemed to imply that Hades wants Zagreus to test the defences so it would make sense if it got harder with each victory
[2023-01-10 03:11:42] <%+N7_Indra> It CAN though
[2023-01-10 03:11:44] <%+N7_Indra> Thats the thing
[2023-01-10 03:11:47] <Hachiyon> @meatmaaan @VanOnTheMoon well base cast isnt that good imo wont help at all wdncREAD
[2023-01-10 03:12:08] <+meatmaaan> yeah they just didnt want to make the difficult forced on players
[2023-01-10 03:12:13] <@%$Pallydan9K> I suppose this is just a sort of keeping up appearances run and if you actually want to test stuff then you'd have to enable it
[2023-01-10 03:12:24] <%+N7_Indra> But gameplay wise a game that only gets harder every time you win is NOT good for accessibility

[2023-01-10 03:18:28] <SuburbanSocrates> Thanatos summon is tricky because it does the most damage, but has a delay. So you have to work it in when the enemy has a phase change or something.

[2023-01-10 03:18:46] <%+N7_Indra> @Pallydan9K I say its best to leave the difficulty in the players hands, so the player can choose to keep things fresh and make things more difficult at their own pace. The heat system in the game is incredibly good and well put together imo

[2023-01-10 04:34:12] <%nola_epeeist> It's 25% pretty early or 40% after you get the specific boons and late in the run.
[2023-01-10 04:34:15] <daniel_leon94> EVERY god gives a debuff, and most of the time you're focusing on 2 or 3 gods anyway

[2023-01-10 04:34:58] <%nola_epeeist> Later in the game, when you have extra darkness, you can have the both and use the other one when doing a status build

[2023-01-10 04:44:15] <+Nemo120> going
[2023-01-10 04:44:16] <%nola_epeeist> attack is pretty slow though, so crits are less likely to trigger than with sword for example.
[2023-01-10 04:44:29] <+derek3891> Always zues for gun imo

[2023-01-10 05:07:52] <RickyRelucent> the worst thing about a shop is that it doesn't count for some boons as a room
[2023-01-10 05:07:54] <%nola_epeeist> The funniest thing is if you can be super lucky and get the revenge boons to proc merciful end. Needs like 6 boons in exactly the correct order.

[2023-01-10 05:12:09] <+meatmaaan> i think
[2023-01-10 05:12:12] <RickyRelucent> quick favor from herm
[2023-01-10 05:12:24] <%nola_epeeist> If you take the aid, it adds the duo to the pool. So take Rav
[2023-01-10 05:12:33] <Aruvella> Ravenous is dope with that cast
[2023-01-10 05:12:36] <+meatmaaan> zeus call boons will pop up more too instead of the ones u want
[2023-01-10 05:12:47] <zxthed> RIGHT
[2023-01-10 05:12:52] <Hachiyon> yes
[2023-01-10 05:12:58] <kvatrio> smaller poll-more chances for duo
[2023-01-10 05:12:58] <%SteveSketches> If you take the duo it adds it to the pool, so if you get zeus you could get the wrong duo instead.

[2023-01-10 05:48:13] <%nola_epeeist> It's slicing shot only because they aren't compatible with one another.

[2023-01-10 05:50:03] <%nola_epeeist> drowning works with fists b/c it lets you pull people into the spell

[2023-01-10 05:50:06] <RickyRelucent> kinda does?
[2023-01-10 05:50:07] <%keeran8894> for the cast

[2023-01-10 05:51:07] <zxthed> level up achilles a little bit
[2023-01-10 05:51:11] <%keeran8894> yoyo build with gauntlets or spear with the knockback. if you're going for the cast Hera bow or Beowulf shield

[2023-01-10 05:52:06] <chiyo721> So achilles + curse of drowning is great since it boosts cast damage. Combo is  Throw, Rush to the spear, then cast, then you get mega damage curse of drowning for all 3 pulses

[2023-01-10 06:06:40] <RickyRelucent> he could....purge some boons
[2023-01-10 06:06:40] <Ibadss> can confirm I used ps4 controller bluethoot on Win 10 an 11 , nothing extra need it just plug it once and done.
[2023-01-10 06:06:58] <zxthed> purging doesnt take the good out of the pool tho

[2023-01-10 07:30:03] <chiyo721> But without cast damage it's wimpy
[2023-01-10 07:30:07] <YamiXx> pretty sure blizzard shot is the whole point in this run LUL

[2023-01-10 07:32:06] <RickyRelucent> @chiyo721 could be nice with cast retrieval range

[2023-01-10 07:32:53] <chiyo721> @chiyo721 That or you go for chaos and additional cast stones. Either works depends on how you feel about going for hermes or chaos

[2023-01-10 07:33:15] <RickyRelucent> hermes or chaos, why not both
[2023-01-10 07:33:31] <RickyRelucent> those, and hammers dont count as boons. if im not just horribly misinformed
[2023-01-10 07:33:38] <RickyRelucent> so i guess they'd work for a bracer run

[2023-01-10 07:33:53] <%nola_epeeist> I don't think think the meta currency is worth buying at this point in the game. You have access to enough blood and diamonds that you don't need to farm

[2023-01-10 08:37:57] <!%Ebonslayer> @ZeGreatPumpkinani Crits have to be random by nature unless your combat system supports locational damage and the means to direct your attacks. Crits are also satisfying.
