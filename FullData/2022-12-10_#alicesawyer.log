[2022-12-10 00:05:21] <tagbarrelstorage> @yev_san Aliens probing intimate areas is way older than south park. It's a common theme of abduction stories that pretty much deconfirms them, as anyone interested in a new species wouldn't jsut repeatedly poke it's ass over and over.

[2022-12-10 00:07:02] <%Majkatt> The second thing humans would try to do with aliens after trying to kill them would be trying to fuck them, I don't think probing is that far fetched

[2022-12-10 00:07:04] <tagbarrelstorage> @QuestionableKittyCat We'd just do a routine examination, maybe behavioral studies in the wild. If you want to look at what's inside you'd dissact, not give them a sensual colonoscopy.
