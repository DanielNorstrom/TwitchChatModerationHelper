[2023-01-06 14:46:52] <Dying_Sun_> i really like the defensive part, loreweave + eternal damnation seems very strong. Especially this league i feel like every second map has - max res rolls on it
[2023-01-06 14:47:00] <ticenl> Ahh so cool fresh start. Slowly getting better at Poe and love rewatching 14hr+ vod of good players‚Äô leaguestarts while making notes. Now have one more run to learn from!
[2023-01-06 14:47:27] <Dying_Sun_> taking notes  pepoG
[2023-01-06 14:47:47] <ADevelopment> i mean jugg + loreweave + eternal damnation is this league's tech. Energised armour goes on well too if you can fit that in your build (EA jugg can do this)

[2023-01-06 16:36:54] <ADevelopment> you just take it slow on upping the essence nodes - not really needed to take them all, just get essences in maps,  and you run them in low maps @saltpastillen

[2023-01-06 16:37:34] <+saltpastillen> Yeah true. I guess the scary nodes are the ones that up the tier and add more essences

[2023-01-06 16:59:39] <%DjakTV> you need to use low temperature cook in the hoven to not dry the things
[2023-01-06 16:59:40] <GrandCleric> you need to heat the pan befoere putting the meat make sure it's hot ebough then you put the meat to seal the juice inside then proceed to next step @nugiyen
[2023-01-06 16:59:42] <%DjakTV> but it takes longer

[2023-01-06 17:20:21] <TiiaAurora> but thats the tasty part!

[2023-01-06 17:21:49] <%Tjingkek> butter is difference
[2023-01-06 17:21:49] <@%QuackSage> warm mayo with added yum
[2023-01-06 17:22:01] <OfficeLackey> @Nugiyen for potato maybe try google Chef Jean Pierre, home fries. maybe an underwhelming recipe, but he's got some good stuff on his channel. ^.^
[2023-01-06 17:22:15] <@%Andrew756> cayenne ofc
[2023-01-06 17:22:23] <@%+DerangedM8> that's a great sauce

[2023-01-06 17:22:45] <dudas2> i mean it's optional maybe he likes it a bit spicy
[2023-01-06 17:22:48] <%Tjingkek> but cayenne is a classic in bearnaise and mayo though
[2023-01-06 17:23:01] <%Tjingkek> just a touch
