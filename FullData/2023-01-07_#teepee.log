[2023-01-07 15:28:51] <%$StreifenOnStream> I used to work at a theatre. Day off wanted to go see a movie with friends, snuck in a BUNCH of food/soda. Ticket ripper know I stuffed my jacket so I said “Pat me down then” and she was like “no I don’t want to touch you” so I just kept walking and that was when I became an outlaw.

[2023-01-07 17:27:33] <%+TruPlayer777> can there be more then 1 team with a nuke on 1 map
[2023-01-07 17:27:33] <%+tritttycent> @ia0ne only the people who have the nuke contract get it in the lobby, no one else
[2023-01-07 17:27:33] <%+Reyyla> hi buddy @HeyItsJohnBoy
[2023-01-07 17:27:37] <%+PJC12582> What percentage of players actually get a nuke? 5 wins in a row and then you have 3 attempts to detonate a Nike
[2023-01-07 17:27:38] <%ttvhyper_1> quick question, if you start the contract at late as possible, does it make it easier? or could elements spawn outside of map still? i’m a bot teep idk lmao
[2023-01-07 17:27:41] <%+HeyItsJohnBoy> he doesnt get grouped with other peoples on streaks
[2023-01-07 17:27:45] <!%GreenBassGuy> Is he asking if everyone in the lobby has a nuke contract? LUL
[2023-01-07 17:27:47] <%dawightloadz> hope they come up with something nuke similar. more rad challenges like these! nukes have been awesome
[2023-01-07 17:27:48] <%badjokeuk> MY most is 1 win in a row

[2023-01-07 17:27:59] <+ePROFis> I think he was asking if the whole team has to be on a streak
[2023-01-07 17:27:59] <%+honeybear2x> Can more than 1 team have a contract in the same game i think he's asking

[2023-01-07 17:28:02] <vibxn1> He's asking if other teams can also be in lobby with a nuke contract
[2023-01-07 17:28:06] <+closure___> hes asking if there are other teams with the contract as well or just one team per lobby
[2023-01-07 17:28:10] <badamzm> He’s asking if everyone else in the lobby on a streak
[2023-01-07 17:28:13] <%donalddaaang> so can you get a nuke next game?

[2023-01-07 17:28:31] <%+BarryBadrinath9> Are Nuke streaks a thing? Like has anyone back to back nuked?
[2023-01-07 17:28:34] <WilboTW> But no, not everyone will be on a Nuke streak

[2023-01-07 17:38:35] <@%^Streamlabs> Teep has not switched his input, he plays both KBM and controller. Typically he switches when it gets stale. His movement feels better on controller, but his shot feels better on mouse. He’s roughly a 70% - 30% split favoring controller. To tell what he is using, look under his spare plates, if "Y" (controller) if 4 (KBM). teepMnk
