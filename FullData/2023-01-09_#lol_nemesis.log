[2023-01-09 15:57:31] <%+SarahSkyWolf> @stromagov Ghost is very strong on immobile champions, and it has a fairly short cooldown so it gives them mobility on a better cd than flash on it's own. Also Lux doesn't NEED a combat spell

[2023-01-09 15:58:57] <%+SarahSkyWolf> You don't need ignite to abuse Qiyana in lane. Barrier doesn't scale at all. Exhaust would be alright but even then, unnecessary and doesn't help vs multiple targets

[2023-01-09 19:40:30] <jongwong> In Beowulf, the hero and his men fight on behalf of a Danish king whose kingdom is terrorized by two monsters. In exchange for their services, the king feeds and houses them. This chapter sets Beowulf beside Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, a Christian romance written around 1400. Although the two stories are different, each of its protagonists proves himself a hero and at the same time discovers how treacherous hospitality can be.
[2023-01-09 19:40:33] <iPlatinumSouledi> @CloudAce understatement? i think its pretty accurate.
