[2023-01-03 03:18:58] <%JackBlaque> wow
[2023-01-03 03:19:04] <%JackBlaque> the Bengals Bills game

[2023-01-03 03:27:57] <%Attckcat> Go blue guys! Yay sportsball! peepoHappy FootBall
[2023-01-03 03:30:30] <%JackBlaque> @Attckcat no, I'm pretty sure a player died
[2023-01-03 03:30:37] <%JackBlaque> or is at least close to it
[2023-01-03 03:31:06] <%Attckcat> Oh wtf
[2023-01-03 03:31:11] <%Attckcat> What happened?
[2023-01-03 03:31:16] <%JackBlaque> he made a tackle
[2023-01-03 03:31:21] <%JackBlaque> stood up from it
[2023-01-03 03:31:25] <%JackBlaque> then just collapsed
[2023-01-03 03:31:43] <%JackBlaque> and within minutes the ambulance was out and they had CPR and defib going
[2023-01-03 03:32:27] <%Attckcat> oh man, do they have any idea what happened?
[2023-01-03 03:32:46] <%Attckcat> or did it just happen?
[2023-01-03 03:36:30] <%Attckcat> I hope he recovers seqFeels
[2023-01-03 04:10:50] <%JackBlaque> they don't know
[2023-01-03 04:11:01] <%JackBlaque> but I though it looked like aortic dissection
[2023-01-03 04:11:18] <%JackBlaque> but coulda been commotio cordis
[2023-01-03 04:14:37] <%+Hawkeye_510> Yeah, I was in the living room watching
[2023-01-03 04:15:38] <%+Hawkeye_510> They both play Saturday, so I can't see the game being played until late next week

[2023-01-03 11:41:00] <%+Hawkeye_510> is there an update on that?
[2023-01-03 11:43:36] <@%W1re> seqSlide @JackBlaque
[2023-01-03 11:43:52] <@%W1re> yeah I just linked it actually
[2023-01-03 11:44:24] <@%W1re> https://www.cnn.com/us/live-news/damar-hamlin-collapse-bills-bengals-game-intl-hnk/index.html
[2023-01-03 11:45:23] <@%W1re> i'd have to have actually watched the footage of his collapse, depending on how long the body was without fresh o xygen, basically how long it took medical staff to begin cpr, will determine his ability to recover and begin a recovery
[2023-01-03 11:46:07] <%Attckcat> according to bbc it was cardiac arrest, but thankfully they restored it
[2023-01-03 11:46:33] <%+Hawkeye_510> I'm surprised they didn't have an AED available.
[2023-01-03 11:46:34] <@%W1re> for the record, UC hospital where he was transported is our level 1 ICU for the area. any patients in that area that require the MOST intensive care are transported to that facility
[2023-01-03 11:47:06] <@%W1re> @Hawkeye_510 AED's are less common than you might expect, but yes it is a terrible oversight of the medical staff on both teams to not travel with an AED
[2023-01-03 11:47:16] <%+Hawkeye_510> how far is the hospital from the stadium?
[2023-01-03 11:47:36] <@%W1re> @Hawkeye_510 lemme look
[2023-01-03 11:48:02] <%+Hawkeye_510> I live like 1.5 miles from our trauma center.
[2023-01-03 11:48:29] <@%W1re> https://www.google.com/maps/search/UC+Hospital/@39.0986935,-84.5125974,16z
[2023-01-03 11:48:41] <@%W1re> the bengals stadium is along the riverfront
[2023-01-03 11:48:42] <%+Hawkeye_510> I'm in the bay area, and I'm sure there's more than 1, but they fly people in from 30+ miles
[2023-01-03 11:48:50] <@%W1re> so maybe 2 minutes if that
[2023-01-03 11:48:57] <%+Hawkeye_510> that's not bad
[2023-01-03 11:49:38] <@%W1re> yeah and ideally the ambo they rolled on the field HAD an aed in it
[2023-01-03 11:50:05] <%+Hawkeye_510> I'm sure they do, and they started CPR before it was on the field
[2023-01-03 11:50:08] <@%^Nightbot> Follow on twitter: @sequisha
[2023-01-03 11:50:08] <@%W1re> once you restore normal sinus rhythm, everything can heal
[2023-01-03 11:50:22] <@%W1re> oxygen flows, you restore homeostasis

[2023-01-03 11:53:09] <@%W1re> prolly won't see another update til later in the morning
[2023-01-03 11:53:37] <@%W1re> intubation isn't *terrible* per se, it's not uncommon. but it doesn't determine his ability to recover
[2023-01-03 11:54:55] <@%W1re> I'm not a doctor so I can't exactly comment on his recovery, but normal vitals are a good sign of positive healing
[2023-01-03 11:55:00] <%+Hawkeye_510> I was sure that was going to be a good game too
[2023-01-03 11:55:16] <@%W1re> I slept right through it KEKW

[2023-01-03 15:22:59] <1killersquirrel> @Sequisha Klean found a glitch: ADS -> free look your dot to the middle -> press tab

[2023-01-03 15:23:14] <%The_Murz> @Sequisha it alters your pov, Klean figured it out

[2023-01-03 15:23:20] <%Rosstoned> @Sequisha try it in hideout if you have training site
[2023-01-03 15:23:20] <Shublues> Yeah, Kleans stream has a ! you can go check.
[2023-01-03 15:23:21] <hemulinhuumaa> then boom, u explode
[2023-01-03 15:23:22] <%GravitysFatalAttraction> make it to were the fov does not change while ADS
[2023-01-03 15:23:22] <%+Killie_Bryzo> Instead of having for FOV reduced when ADSing, it'll keep your FOV as it was
[2023-01-03 15:23:25] <%JohnDoeRadio> the FOV is calculated vertically in tarkov
[2023-01-03 15:23:28] <Fishofalltrades> The FOV thing is something Klean found. He has a untuned video about it
[2023-01-03 15:23:33] <%+WeatheredMachine> @Arrican Yes! Benny's fourteen too. He was vomiting everything for no reason - we were considering surgery before I changed his food brand, turns out he disagrees with grains now
[2023-01-03 15:23:44] <1killersquirrel> not intended, but looks cool for CQB
[2023-01-03 15:23:45] <+Catalyst_LF> no zoom when ads
[2023-01-03 15:23:48] <%The_Murz> I think Klean posted it on twitter
[2023-01-03 15:23:50] <dudeTF2> sounds like ban KEKW
[2023-01-03 15:23:56] <JaynisK> But yeah, that 213 key is to an always open room. All I can think is... why? What purpose does that serve? elaWeird

[2023-01-03 15:24:06] <$Chthonian> It's a bug with the new zoom out thing when you free look while aiming and people are going to be abusing it until it's fixed
[2023-01-03 15:24:09] <@%Arrican> @WeatheredMachine SAME with Spolly, she was vomiting and pooping everywhere, which is NOT at all like her.  Gave her 24 hours, fluids, and some drugs, it was great.

Nikita rents a few more, but providers are not keen to give more (especially if there are tourneys for other games and such). So, in beginning of wipe, there's too many players for the servers available.

[2023-01-03 21:24:05] <%Rida_plz> Only way to stop cheating would be to count cheats as tampering with software and make it a crime. Though, I feel that sort of law would have other bad effects
[2023-01-03 21:24:08] <+AndreiSZS> @Sequisha release it on console with mouse support and cross play disabled
