[2022-12-21 16:09:46] <El_Chialde> Dellerium, ritual and blight are all good early league
[2022-12-21 16:09:47] <Furycrab> Delirium also pretty good left side
[2022-12-21 16:09:55] <CasiMudo> they add tons of rares

[2022-12-21 16:10:11] <CasiMudo> which is valid on cerain ways of farming
[2022-12-21 16:10:43] <CasiMudo> christmas dream land it becomes :D
[2022-12-21 16:10:53] <Kesto_v> does spell echo have similar overlapping effect with imp. doom as spell cascade? tested it little bit but i'm still in new campaign with low gems and gear

[2022-12-21 16:12:17] <El_Chialde> swapping to Blight, Ritual, Beasts and Dellerium might be a good way, since there are so many options for uniques in that content
[2022-12-21 16:12:43] <El_Chialde> unques form blight chests and delerium rewards
[2022-12-21 16:13:10] <CasiMudo> @Kesto_v i think the main difference is that you get less potential overlapped areas, which in general is less dmg

[2022-12-21 16:15:01] <Kesto_v> thx
[2022-12-21 16:15:36] <El_Chialde> according to Winningest it actually is a disadvantage to use it
[2022-12-21 16:15:50] <El_Chialde> he had a comment post explaining it
[2022-12-21 16:16:04] VIEWERS: 464
[2022-12-21 16:16:05] <El_Chialde> it was with vixens in his build
[2022-12-21 16:16:44] <+StallionM> @El_Chialde ruetoo needs the tech but Woke spell cascade makes clearing much better tho\
[2022-12-21 16:17:01] <El_Chialde> he said "there is a 165 ms cooldown on impending doom" so it ends up being worse for spell cascade
[2022-12-21 16:17:43] <El_Chialde> with vixens, without it would be better
[2022-12-21 16:17:47] <Kesto_v> i'm running vixen's and clear feels very similar to cascade. but just starting
