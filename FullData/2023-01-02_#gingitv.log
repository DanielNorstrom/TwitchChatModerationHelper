[2023-01-02 18:14:41] <+skyee13> @niangkng name of the macro he got there
[2023-01-02 18:14:44] <im_naturee> @themag1cian very close but logs show mostly sin/sub for boss and outlaw for aoe like council
[2023-01-02 18:14:44] <%+niangkng> @hidingi so its a switch between sinister strike and ambush?

[2023-01-02 18:15:13] <Feinton> @mrz_as together with acadamy trinket= ez 300k dps on 6 targets for 12-15 seconds
[2023-01-02 18:15:16] <whiteiversen_> So u would say sub is easier than outlaw?

[2023-01-02 18:15:50] <boomstick093> I Think outlaw feels abit more clunky to play vs sub. And to much rng, But again i havent used the time i should to get good at it 😊
[2023-01-02 18:16:14] <+finarfin72> In fortified they are not a nice combo no :D

[2023-01-02 19:27:36] <Yesidid480> @proteinz89 I would say Zaelia. They had to get up at 5 am to raid so the fact he even showed is above all expectations!
[2023-01-02 19:27:36] <alpocopatroleros> @Zunraa Because other classes performed better for whatever reason? Like, define popular

[2023-01-02 23:51:33] <pringlay> you just run through last second and get like 2-3 second debuff only
[2023-01-02 23:51:34] <ryan97744> you just go thru it at last secound and dot dissapears when adds despawn @GingiTV
[2023-01-02 23:51:36] <+Acecto> so you just fully ignore, and go opposite wall
[2023-01-02 23:51:41] <+Bigmacwow> it is actually a strat it expires asfter like 6sec
[2023-01-02 23:51:45] <simo7466> u run to the wall, when the ads reach it u run through the skeletons, once they despawn the debuff get removed
