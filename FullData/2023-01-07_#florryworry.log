[2023-01-07 12:13:39] <%tolstoyyyy> 50% increase is actually decent. especially since that trade node will be way better than 9 total income at basically any point beyond 1444. THE PROBLEM IS you always want to CONQUER all the provinces in your home node (and every other node you desire). once you did, mercantilism does nothing. zilch.

[2023-01-07 12:16:11] <%tolstoyyyy> so actually mercantilism is good when you a. play super-tall, like 5-10 provinces max and b. don't have any vassals either (because you could just steal their trade). so you will never just conquer all the provinces in the node. in that guys, just go for mercantilism, yes. but it's an incredibly boring way to play. even most 'tall' campaigns have like 20-30 provinces owned, which is more than enough to dominate home node and not need mercantilism again.

[2023-01-07 13:59:47] <$strepsels___> I found a way to swap out of Celestial Empire. If you start as Livonian Order, go secularisation path, take Mandate, then start Livonian Order events to swap to a new government, then go Orthodox+Greek you can form Byz after finishing the events which forces you to swap to Livonian government (whatever one you choose). You can still go Japanese culture and swap Daimyo since Livonian governments are not locked @Florryworry

[2023-01-07 15:56:47] <%LordSeru> @florryworry I think it would work
[2023-01-07 15:56:47] <emti_de> no u cant, bc you cant explore the tiles in the middle @Florryworry
[2023-01-07 15:56:48] <%Tayip999> no it dies
[2023-01-07 15:56:52] <blirph> exploring doesn't take attrition
[2023-01-07 15:56:53] <Kulisiak> won't know if you don't try

[2023-01-07 15:57:16] <%Astronelson> Unless the mission is to circumnavigate the world for some reason
[2023-01-07 15:57:19] <blirph> I think it will work yes

[2023-01-07 16:01:01] <%shotgun2600> too bad you have one port in europe

[2023-01-07 16:01:11] <%Tayip999> circumnavigating is a specific mission that allows attrition
[2023-01-07 16:01:14] <electric_sea> why don't you do it in non-ironman, it seems much easier Kappa
[2023-01-07 16:01:16] <%Punkatsub> Won't you only be able to do this like once? @Florryworry
