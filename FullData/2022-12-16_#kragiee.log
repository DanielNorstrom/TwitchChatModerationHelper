[2022-12-16 20:12:45] <%agiro01> x kinda needs a blood pressure med and an antipsychotic too LUL
[2022-12-16 20:12:47] <!%Mikeverv> Yep
[2022-12-16 20:12:49] <SpaceTimeFPS> Based take by xQc
[2022-12-16 20:12:51] <%xGenero> yea
[2022-12-16 20:12:57] <notMvpcya> it's public information
[2022-12-16 20:12:59] <@%$nasty__nate___> not doxxing
[2022-12-16 20:13:00] <enbielievable> notably, that is public information
[2022-12-16 20:13:04] <sushiicattt> wait.. i thought that happened on github?
[2022-12-16 20:13:10] <%sekcaJ> It is
[2022-12-16 20:13:10] <SpaceTimeFPS> @kragiee no it's public info
[2022-12-16 20:13:10] <Grenoybel> it's public information
[2022-12-16 20:13:10] <%xGenero> it is public yea
[2022-12-16 20:13:12] <%letsjustwip3> yes
[2022-12-16 20:13:15] <RustyRazy> it's public info. all flight patterns are
[2022-12-16 20:13:15] <+elonmusk_leftnut> The tracker was providing real time location data
[2022-12-16 20:13:16] VIEWERS: 1 399
[2022-12-16 20:13:17] <x8_Ballx> it was all public data anyway.. someone just did something with it
[2022-12-16 20:13:22] <+elonmusk_leftnut> The publicly available info is delayed
[2022-12-16 20:13:23] <gerzapp> why would it be public information where he's taking a PRIVATE jet..?
[2022-12-16 20:13:25] <+elonmusk_leftnut> Less of a security risk that way
[2022-12-16 20:13:38] <@%$nasty__nate___> @gerzapp in public airspace
[2022-12-16 20:13:40] <%xGenero> he even said that he wont ban the acct then secretly shadow banned it
[2022-12-16 20:13:40] <%sekcaJ> But not everyone knows how to look at it. That was a fan account following his jet only
[2022-12-16 20:13:40] <!%Mikeverv> It would yes but giving it more attention could be kinda bad
[2022-12-16 20:13:46] <+elonmusk_leftnut> The Elon jet was doxxing because it was real time data
[2022-12-16 20:13:48] <+Yohoho151rum> still have to fly under the rules of the FAA.  thats why
[2022-12-16 20:13:54] <+livingod1> kind of a grey area
[2022-12-16 20:13:56] <notMvpcya> gerzapp because countries require that information so.. I dunno... think about 9/11??
[2022-12-16 20:13:57] <gerzapp> public airspace...?? what??
[2022-12-16 20:14:06] <CiRcUiTzzz1> real time compared to delayed public information
[2022-12-16 20:14:07] <SpaceTimeFPS> It's just more accessible to normands and psychopaths who are not tech savvy. @kragiee
[2022-12-16 20:14:10] <mEmUrUk> server side
[2022-12-16 20:14:12] <Grenoybel> the elmo stans are anoying
[2022-12-16 20:14:14] <mEmUrUk> ?
[2022-12-16 20:14:16] <%xGenero> no insider info
[2022-12-16 20:14:26] <!%Mikeverv> Oh its real time yeah thats kinda bad if its not public
[2022-12-16 20:14:32] <%letsjustwip3> data is already public, all the guy did was put it all together and publish it
[2022-12-16 20:14:32] <%sekcaJ> yes
[2022-12-16 20:14:33] <mEmUrUk> well than twitter has a fcking security issue LUL
[2022-12-16 20:14:34] <%xGenero> yup
[2022-12-16 20:14:34] <!%Mikeverv> Why would he even post it tho?
[2022-12-16 20:14:35] <sushiicattt> it happened on github though i swear?
[2022-12-16 20:14:35] <mEmUrUk> once again
[2022-12-16 20:14:43] <faro_oi> Yah
[2022-12-16 20:14:52] <%letsjustwip3> true
[2022-12-16 20:14:55] <mEmUrUk> only if you know how
[2022-12-16 20:14:57] <CueBall_tv> yes
[2022-12-16 20:14:59] <+LordHysteric> for the record elon said he would not ban that twitter account due to free speech and then went ahead and banned him anyway
[2022-12-16 20:15:00] <Grenoybel> yes
[2022-12-16 20:15:00] <SpaceTimeFPS> It's public realtime info for a private jet. Yes every country needs to know where the fuck you fly your plane...

[2022-12-16 20:15:09] <+LordHysteric> and yes the data is 100% public record

[2022-12-16 20:15:39] <gerzapp> are we saying just cuz he owns twitter he shouldn't have ANY PRIVACY????
[2022-12-16 20:15:40] <%sekcaJ> But unbanning hate groups KEKW
[2022-12-16 20:15:43] <x8_Ballx> because its elon musk. why wouldnt he.. hes a soy boy
[2022-12-16 20:15:44] <%xGenero> he just bans accts that teases him lol
[2022-12-16 20:15:44] <+elonmusk_leftnut> Elon is just turning into a true space Karen
[2022-12-16 20:15:45] <%Datpokeguy> Because he's so sensitive
[2022-12-16 20:15:52] <BooRadley0> you just google "flight data" and get the info...everyone can do that
[2022-12-16 20:15:55] <+elonmusk_leftnut> That’s coming from his left nut, right nut agrees too
[2022-12-16 20:16:04] <mEmUrUk> they prolly find a way, yeah
[2022-12-16 20:16:13] <Grenoybel> investors follow this high profile grifters to know early signs of investing
[2022-12-16 20:16:15] <%agiro01> they just hit up a skillshare assassination tutorial
[2022-12-16 20:16:24] <CueBall_tv> it is all public knowledge. flight takeoff and land times are all public knowledge
[2022-12-16 20:16:33] <@%$nasty__nate___> it's bad for the environment anyways PepeLaughington
[2022-12-16 20:16:38] <gerzapp> thats just not the case. i mean it stars there just to know where he is...? no one's assassinating him in the sky LUL
[2022-12-16 20:16:38] <BooRadley0> @elonmusk_leftnut they were using public info for the twitter profile tho
[2022-12-16 20:16:40] <%Datpokeguy> Bro gets so insecure about being hated despite being a billionaire who could afford to hide in a mansion for the rest of his life if he wanted
[2022-12-16 20:16:48] <mEmUrUk> he could even attatch some appla airtag to the plane LUL
[2022-12-16 20:16:54] <mEmUrUk> *apple

[2022-12-16 20:17:18] <+livingod1> it's for his children security also...he had weird stalkers waiting for him at the locations..
[2022-12-16 20:17:19] <Lee113Epix> hes getting rid of mastordon links now XD
[2022-12-16 20:17:22] <!%Mikeverv> DaftJam
[2022-12-16 20:17:26] <%xGenero> they were saying boo-llionaire
[2022-12-16 20:17:26] <Dekuyra> What he didnt do is ban the account, all he said was its a risk to his families safety
[2022-12-16 20:17:32] <+elonmusk_leftnut> They used public info and enhanced it to provide real time locations. I don’t think that would be difficult to do. Sounds like a pretty simple alto
[2022-12-16 20:17:35] <+elonmusk_leftnut> Algo*
[2022-12-16 20:17:36] <faro_oi> Does anyone know where is messi
[2022-12-16 20:17:51] <Dekuyra> He didnt ban the account because what that account did was freedom of speech. So kudos to him for that
[2022-12-16 20:17:59] <Saturdaywww> its public information but if u have a lot of haters you probably dont want to get attention on things like where r u at any time
[2022-12-16 20:17:59] <@%$nasty__nate___> HACKERMANS enhance
[2022-12-16 20:18:02] <x8_Ballx> it is a risk though. People kid nap elites kids for ransome.. Happens way more than you would think
[2022-12-16 20:18:11] <kaiber666> We on silly salmon now
[2022-12-16 20:18:22] <%agiro01> the solution? don't fly on yo private jet LUL
[2022-12-16 20:18:23] <+LordHysteric> the data is used to make sure planes dont crash in midair
[2022-12-16 20:18:25] <aegisbh> @kaiber666 he gave it a break
[2022-12-16 20:18:31] <+LordHysteric> so public knowledge lol
[2022-12-16 20:18:34] <SpaceTimeFPS> Twitter helps dumb it down for them though, less effort to look at a Twitter page than to hunt down the public info. (Yeah Elon kinda scared for himself and fam). He could just "NOT" use a private jet and be fucking normal. He wants to be rich, not famous.
[2022-12-16 20:18:39] <aegisbh> i do understand elon wants pirvacy
[2022-12-16 20:18:45] <aegisbh> and people flame him for it
[2022-12-16 20:18:52] <%sekcaJ> What's the risk? Someone finding out he visits a weird island in the middle of nowhere? mapuowB
[2022-12-16 20:19:06] <enbielievable> lol
[2022-12-16 20:19:09] <aegisbh> ye cuz nobody will see who he is
[2022-12-16 20:19:09] <%Datpokeguy> Any celebrity needs security for their family, just look at sports people being targeted for robberies

[2022-12-16 20:19:33] <SpaceTimeFPS> Is he going to buy two F-35s to protect his private jet?
[2022-12-16 20:19:35] <%xGenero> the point is that its one account in a long string of unreasonable bans  lol
[2022-12-16 20:19:42] <ruffles___> what happened to the unranked account 🤔
[2022-12-16 20:19:43] <%xGenero> its adding to his record

[2022-12-16 20:20:18] <mEmUrUk> anyone here who played it
[2022-12-16 20:20:20] <+livingod1> he could have have buy the account for less than 44Billions LUL
[2022-12-16 20:20:27] <ruffles___> @Mikeverv he finished what?
[2022-12-16 20:20:27] <%Datpokeguy> Can't wait till Elon makes up a new rule to ban people that affected him the day before
[2022-12-16 20:20:32] <whiplaxx> @gerzapp BabyRage
[2022-12-16 20:20:33] <%sekcaJ> he's probably tanking the stock to resign as CEO after but holding the stock. So when it spikes up again: profit
[2022-12-16 20:20:37] <vivaelprincipe> Is SillySalmon main?
[2022-12-16 20:20:50] <kaiber666> No
[2022-12-16 20:20:53] <+livingod1> just give the guy a couple millions to stop posting his location
[2022-12-16 20:20:56] <!%Mikeverv> @ruffles___ No hes diamond 2 i think
[2022-12-16 20:21:00] <SpaceTimeFPS> @sekcaj also reasonable take
[2022-12-16 20:21:13] <!%Mikeverv> @vivaelprincipe No not his main
[2022-12-16 20:21:16] <mEmUrUk> I mean there is some degree of security risk if you fire most of your staff LUL and some of them might hate you for it, especially the IT ones LUL
