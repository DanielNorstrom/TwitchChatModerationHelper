[2022-12-28 02:27:33] <$Xelaxon> there are so many tile interactions and it really makes the game come alive, i love it
[2022-12-28 02:27:34] <%+Radiosurgery> @eatingpotatoes25 extremely different.
[2022-12-28 02:27:42] <%DeweyWynn> Get smashed everybody! barbBan
[2022-12-28 02:27:45] <%$Near____________> @xelaxon that seems more apt description
[2022-12-28 02:27:50] <%MMage09> cleave run it is
[2022-12-28 02:27:51] <%smidty> the fun gimmick for this game is discovering the card synergies
[2022-12-28 02:27:54] <%Topgun486> this game reminds me of being a irl Dungeon Master. making it difficult for thr characters to be fun and challenging but not so much that the party wipe at first
[2022-12-28 02:28:02] <$Xelaxon> for example, you can remove the grove and the blood grove will become a whole different tile
[2022-12-28 02:28:06] <%Topgun486> they*
[2022-12-28 02:28:06] <%+Radiosurgery> Yeah they could do a lot with a sequel man.
[2022-12-28 02:28:06] <weezel79> yeah, smidty
[2022-12-28 02:28:10] <%+doomydoggy> NODDERS
[2022-12-28 02:28:18] <%morsecodec> I like the Dungeon Master analogy, Dan. Perfect way to look at it
[2022-12-28 02:28:21] <%toxicpycnometer> yup
[2022-12-28 02:28:23] <%+Radiosurgery> I'm gonna have to go back to this for sure
[2022-12-28 02:28:25] <%rabidwombat311> he doesn't know about tile combos
[2022-12-28 02:28:28] <%toxicpycnometer> oh there IS
[2022-12-28 02:28:30] <$Xelaxon> yep, tons of interactions like that
[2022-12-28 02:28:30] <MattKun> there's a ton of secrets
[2022-12-28 02:28:33] <%Aknox23> Devolver make some cool ass stuff
[2022-12-28 02:28:33] <%smidty> yup
[2022-12-28 02:28:35] <IIAbeLincolnII> Yeah
[2022-12-28 02:28:35] <%+Jualol> lots of secrets in this game
[2022-12-28 02:28:35] <%corignis> iirc it becomes a Hungry Blood Grove that executes at a higher HP % and can spawn golems
[2022-12-28 02:28:37] <%+bayetovsky> there's a lot of synergies
[2022-12-28 02:28:37] <%+GaimeGuy> sneaky sneaky peepoClap
[2022-12-28 02:28:41] <KarraChr000> There are a ton of hidden tiles, yeah
[2022-12-28 02:28:41] <mmato_> if you oblivion some tiles they change
[2022-12-28 02:28:44] <%+Jualol> lots of tile combos
[2022-12-28 02:28:46] <Pacific_Onion> just try placing things next to each other and you will find some cool interactions
[2022-12-28 02:28:52] <%WiLDRAGE777> there are combination of tiles that unlock new ones
[2022-12-28 02:28:55] <%$Blastphemy1290> CUMDETECTED
[2022-12-28 02:28:57] <IIAbeLincolnII> You can do it with just a 3x3 of rocks
[2022-12-28 02:29:01] <MattKun> you've gotten flowers a few times too :)
[2022-12-28 02:29:02] <BahamutOdin> The meadows don’t need to be close to the road?
[2022-12-28 02:29:03] <$Xelaxon> there are tons of cards you dont have yet, theres only a handful of synergies atm
[2022-12-28 02:29:04] <+MentalErection> Did this game ever get updates?
[2022-12-28 02:29:08] <%+chrisclark104> finally having my first playthrough of elden ring, I watched you play some. but i can't even describe the feeling of exploring even the first area and seeing how huge this world was. felt some real joy, how would you describe your first hour or so in elden ring?
[2022-12-28 02:29:08] <%+Radiosurgery> Yeah the gameplay options really open up eventually

[2022-12-28 02:29:22] <%+airhornsurprise> Yeah there's a lot of neat interactions to discover as you play
[2022-12-28 02:29:23] <weezel79> just like your meadows change depending on what you put them next to
[2022-12-28 02:29:26] <%corignis> I wish twitch chat had a spoiler tag like Discord does Sadge

[2022-12-28 02:30:00] <%$Lyconnn> when you see the enemies get consumed in vines it means the blood grove got the killing blow for you
[2022-12-28 02:30:04] <%smidty> they used to have spoiler chat
[2022-12-28 02:30:05] <$Xelaxon> it gives culling strike, basically
[2022-12-28 02:30:18] <%ViciousHorizon> 50% of every message is logos, icons and names LUL
[2022-12-28 02:30:18] <$Xelaxon> but also does something else that makes it really good

[2022-12-28 02:30:29] <%MatraTheEternal> Wouldn't vamp drain from all the targets you hit?

[2022-12-28 02:30:49] <%$Thatonedudetoo> So, how do you win?
[2022-12-28 02:30:54] <%+Renaldo_Moon> vampyrsm gets better with attack speed too
[2022-12-28 02:30:54] <%GucciGosling> seems like vampirism combined with all the damge to all would be good
[2022-12-28 02:30:58] <%corignis> does Vampirism activate on Counters?
[2022-12-28 02:30:58] <%+Radiosurgery> If you have high attack speed vamp is better
[2022-12-28 02:31:00] <%MMage09> you got that stupid strong sword at the end of that run too lol

[2022-12-28 03:12:30] <+thanatosia> I really think you might like POE if you just ran through the first 5 acts with minimal killing.   The game is bloated with too much content so that full clearing through the early game overlevels you (no one actually plays that way).  That said, I understand its the games fault for failing it's early design.

[2022-12-28 03:38:27] <%JaguarPT> wilky37 well there you go, left wrist safety is why they make ergonomic keyboards, its the area were you rest your wrist on the table thats at most risk, since fingers and forearm cause movement and the wrist is pushing down causing atrittion, holding things (controllers or mouse especialy ) will fuck up your thumb as thats the area you pinch for grip

[2022-12-28 04:22:57] <%Beakstore> @swedechick nope once the loop starts the movement is automatic
[2022-12-28 04:23:00] <%DeweyWynn> @Corking118 Ah yeah, if you're going for a denser crust like graham cracker I've found they're ok. But homemade for the classic crust style cannot be beat

[2022-12-28 04:37:01] <Lainilly> the fun part of Into The Breach is doing it on Hard with other teams
[2022-12-28 04:37:01] <%+thehert95> oh man, i played this game so long when it came out
[2022-12-28 04:37:06] <%MMage09> all the ftl streamers played the hell out of it for a month and never went back
[2022-12-28 04:37:06] <%$Fruitier_Keith> and the new mechs are not as fun as new ships in FTL
[2022-12-28 04:37:08] <%+thehert95> have all the achievements
[2022-12-28 04:37:16] <%+WilyBomby> about into the breach and the no campaign, wasnt it the same for FTL tho?
[2022-12-28 04:37:22] <%lazymashi> this game is strangely addicting to watch
[2022-12-28 04:37:27] <@%$DanTheVP> It really just lacks a compelling reason to play it more after winning
[2022-12-28 04:37:31] <%90PercentLettuce> Into the breach is better suited for mobile imo
[2022-12-28 04:37:33] <%$azrael_dr> some more metaprogression on Into the Breach would be nice
[2022-12-28 04:37:40] <Spinjump19> yeah I didn't really get addicted to Into the Breach until I tried out hard mode with the advanced content
[2022-12-28 04:37:43] <%+noober09> FTL really had compelling reasons to keep going.
[2022-12-28 04:37:44] <JOHADS> @lazymashi i've found i enjoy some games better when i watch them than when i play them
[2022-12-28 04:37:57] VIEWERS: 3 236
[2022-12-28 04:37:59] <@%$DanTheVP> the gameplay loop is a lot shorter
[2022-12-28 04:38:00] <%Mr_Android> it took you a lot longer to win your first FTL run
[2022-12-28 04:38:02] <%$azrael_dr> KEKW
[2022-12-28 04:38:04] <%lazymashi> @JOHADS same here... LUL
[2022-12-28 04:38:05] <%MMage09> ftl has way more randomness involved
[2022-12-28 04:38:07] <%RichMoney3315> management
[2022-12-28 04:38:08] <%+airhornsurprise> More variety in FTL
[2022-12-28 04:38:10] <%$Fruitier_Keith> a lot more variation in an FTL run
[2022-12-28 04:38:11] <%+jamescid> not enough O2 management
[2022-12-28 04:38:13] <%+WilyBomby> yes, thats what im wondering too LUL
[2022-12-28 04:38:14] <%OOOO_Sebby> because FTL is different in mechanics
[2022-12-28 04:38:16] <%Alfonso_Khan> ITB didnt kick you in the balls enough compared to FTL
[2022-12-28 04:38:18] <maleblackfiora> game is not really hard but you can be a derp and just die every single time
[2022-12-28 04:38:18] <CabbitGurl> I wish this game had more combination, maybe if they make a second one it will
[2022-12-28 04:38:24] <%+bananahammock2122> Into the breach feels like you made the mistake. FTL feels like the game screws you over
[2022-12-28 04:38:25] <%gitwithit> Ftl fuck you out of nowhere
[2022-12-28 04:38:32] <%$izombie387> which one annoys you?
[2022-12-28 04:38:32] <Spinjump19> normal mode in breach is like easy mode in FTL honestly
[2022-12-28 04:38:33] <%$Septomor> the tactics style game deserves a campaign
[2022-12-28 04:38:33] <%rabidwombat311> The Rusting Hulks are pretty OP. it'd be like getting Crystal Ship early
[2022-12-28 04:38:35] <%DeweyWynn> Into the Breach is much less reliant on RNG for success.
[2022-12-28 04:38:35] <Segaia00> fans of FTL were more annoying?
[2022-12-28 04:38:36] <@%$DanTheVP> FTL has 7 worlds vs 4. and the FTL worlds are larger
[2022-12-28 04:38:39] <%$DarkSlash88> The tactics gameplay is more conducive to a campaign
[2022-12-28 04:38:41] <%beatnik86> @bananahammock2122 so true
[2022-12-28 04:38:52] <%+solidpeyo> you got addicted to the FTL bullshit LUL
[2022-12-28 04:38:53] <%$vriskawants> your deaths in this seem greed based, deaths in FTL just...happen
[2022-12-28 04:39:01] <%Missing_Node> I feel like roguelites are all about the gameplay loop. If you enjoy playing the game to play it instead of winning, you'll want to replay it.

[2022-12-28 14:36:08] <Varsidian> LUL i like this version of mario. So done with listening to people prattle on about their problems. Just be done with it, ill unclog the pipe now shut up
[2022-12-28 14:36:14] <%NobletOfU> This one better than the previous one?
[2022-12-28 14:36:16] <%skkruff> Rabids are from Rayman originally
[2022-12-28 14:36:17] <%Fiirestar3344> @herewaard i mean its the first time you see it, so

[2022-12-28 14:38:09] <+frostynezz> I ended up liking the story

[2022-12-28 14:38:13] <%Dingusamingus> I kinda hated the story/characters in that game
[2022-12-28 14:38:15] <%xius0> Triangle Strategy is liek Ogre Battle @BarbarousKing
[2022-12-28 14:38:21] <%Jomo7> Is this XCOM - Mario Unknown?
[2022-12-28 14:38:33] <Circassa> @Jomo7 yes
[2022-12-28 14:38:36] <%KoltonMcCombo> Morning barb dawg!
[2022-12-28 14:38:40] <a_yeti> I thought Triangle Strategy was great.
[2022-12-28 14:38:41] <%$DarkSlash88> Crystal Project is like the Elden Ring of jrpgs. Minimal story, lots of exploration.
[2022-12-28 14:38:44] <%+Kiavik> I think he meant tactics ogre
[2022-12-28 14:38:45] <%+Dark668> like the good Ogre Battle, not the N64 one
[2022-12-28 14:38:46] <%Dingusamingus> Nah it's nothing like Ogre Battle 64 lmao
[2022-12-28 14:38:47] <%+Fail_Snail> ogre battle 64 is way different than other ogre games
[2022-12-28 14:39:08] <HolaKnight> is this game counterstrike=
[2022-12-28 14:39:13] <%+Sorry4HavingFun> many people confuse ogre battle with tactics ogre. Ogre Battle you dont do anything, Tactics Ogre you do everything
[2022-12-28 14:39:13] <perinha222> you have way more freedom with team composition in this game compared to the first one
[2022-12-28 14:39:19] <benderintime> tactics ogre / ogre battle have stories in the same universe but the gameplay is insanely different
[2022-12-28 14:39:31] <%Fiirestar3344> there is 2: Ogre battle like the N64 one, and Tactics ogre is more like FFT

[2022-12-28 15:22:22] <%neily_o> Disney bought Fox
[2022-12-28 15:22:23] <%y2zipper> yes
[2022-12-28 15:22:24] <%Miets> now Disney will run X-Men into the ground
[2022-12-28 15:22:25] <%Fiirestar3344> yep
[2022-12-28 15:22:25] <%$TheMuznick> yes
[2022-12-28 15:22:25] <%$ShelbyvilleThrillhouse> barb is buying the rights to X-Men, announced later today
[2022-12-28 15:22:25] <%$Near____________> yup
[2022-12-28 15:22:27] <%+Corbyn_J> deadpool is going to be added to the MCU
[2022-12-28 15:22:29] <%Approximate__Knowledge> lmfao
[2022-12-28 15:22:32] <%Miets> Hell no
[2022-12-28 15:22:32] <%Megs_1300> Disney owns everything eventually
[2022-12-28 15:22:33] <%+jamescid> disney would buy everything
[2022-12-28 15:22:35] <%cornsbakedgoods> please no
[2022-12-28 15:22:35] <%Randallooch> god i hope not
[2022-12-28 15:22:38] <%$Blastphemy1290> the behemoth grows
[2022-12-28 15:22:38] <%$Toadv1ne> that would be wild
[2022-12-28 15:22:39] <%9s_nine> does disney own aliens
[2022-12-28 15:22:39] <%laundrycoinmachine> sony wouldnt sell
[2022-12-28 15:22:39] <%$Near____________> Let's hope not
[2022-12-28 15:22:39] <%psilocybinsensation> @Corbyn_J Dude noo
[2022-12-28 15:22:41] <%manfred_bratwurst> i don't hink they have the money, Sony is kinda beeg
[2022-12-28 15:22:41] <%Glorithan> If xbox cant buy activision, Disney cant buy sony
[2022-12-28 15:22:42] <%TiniTinyTONY> no and sony won't sell
[2022-12-28 15:22:43] <Spinjump19> hopefully that would be blocked by the FTC
[2022-12-28 15:22:43] <Qwertyui606> sony has spider man and playstation not much else nowadays
[2022-12-28 15:22:44] <$sussyscotty> Wait, Disney doesn't have access to ALL of the Marvel IP's, right?
[2022-12-28 15:22:44] <%Miets> Sony is still a japanese company
[2022-12-28 15:22:45] <Shockingshields> Disney is just buying everyone tbh, but Monopoly's aren't a thing 4Head
[2022-12-28 15:22:46] <%+RaDazio98> oh no.. sony would be too expensive even for disney
[2022-12-28 15:22:46] <%$teddyb20> Apple very well might buy Disney
[2022-12-28 15:22:47] <%+Screegar> Rumour while back that Apple was looking into Sony
[2022-12-28 15:22:47] <%+Garnix_99> sony is too expensive probably
[2022-12-28 15:22:49] <%nasagivii> disney would buy human souls if they were a viable form of currency anywhere but hell
[2022-12-28 15:22:50] <%$sco00bysnacks> Sony has to just make a movie every couple of years, plus they get the games as PS exclusively
[2022-12-28 15:22:53] <%akai_suisei> Disney aims to buy a death star at this point
[2022-12-28 15:22:54] <%Cristophlyz> Disney is buying all the American properties, and Sony is buying all the anime properties
[2022-12-28 15:22:55] <Circassa> I'm dreading to see spiderman and mickey mouse together
[2022-12-28 15:22:55] <%+IlllIIIlllIlIlIIllllIIIlI> can we get any anti-trust laws that mean anything, please?
[2022-12-28 15:22:55] <%Mr_Panda> you can have rights to just comic book rights for characters or parts of characters or just movies, its -very- convoluted
[2022-12-28 15:22:55] <%+NealDiamond85> disney buys sony, and Kratos becomes a princess lol
[2022-12-28 15:22:59] <%+thoranth> modCheck antitrust laws
[2022-12-28 15:23:00] <%$ByTorTheCatfish> Seems more likely they’d just buy the spider-man rights back
[2022-12-28 15:23:00] <%$TheMuznick> god please no, Disney just needs to fucking stop
[2022-12-28 15:23:03] <%exeswiss87> its pretty much impossible to buy a japanese company
[2022-12-28 15:23:04] <MostlyPureOrange> The way sony is acting with xbox
[2022-12-28 15:23:05] <+ChainWhippin> I don’t want to but a Diney PlayStation
[2022-12-28 15:23:05] <+Gam3cok> Would proibaably be considered aa monopoly. Disney had to sell off aa large part of Fox
[2022-12-28 15:23:09] <+OVERM1ND> sony and disney are the same size comapnies
[2022-12-28 15:23:10] <%Cathuriges> disney should be dismantled honestly
[2022-12-28 15:23:12] <+LyonTamer> @barbarousking I think Disney buying Nintendo is more likely. I’ve heard Apple buying Sony.
[2022-12-28 15:23:19] <%$Anthony3> Disney isn’t considering buying sony right?
[2022-12-28 15:23:21] <%$Anthony3> Please no
[2022-12-28 15:23:23] <%TiniTinyTONY> let's all pool our money and buy sony
[2022-12-28 15:23:23] <Hyo24> Disney should just offer all disney games exclusive to playstation for spiderman
[2022-12-28 15:23:24] <%GucciGosling> I'm waiting for the day Disney buys
[2022-12-28 15:23:24] <%+Screegar> Sony could be bought by a trillion dollar company easily
[2022-12-28 15:23:24] <%+dalesiov17> they could also sell/buy only parts of the company or the rights to IP
[2022-12-28 15:23:26] <%$TheMuznick> @Cathuriges NODDERS they are way too fucking big
[2022-12-28 15:23:27] <%$Blastphemy1290> LUL
[2022-12-28 15:23:30] <%$Nigidius> that would be gross
[2022-12-28 15:23:32] <$IamBeakman> Disney could buy the Sony movie part, but the whole is very unlikely
[2022-12-28 15:23:32] <Circassa> KEKW
[2022-12-28 15:23:35] <%$ByTorTheCatfish> Disney couldn’t afford it
[2022-12-28 15:23:36] <%+jamescid> mickey mouse vs mario peepoClap
[2022-12-28 15:23:36] <%Miets> I really can't see anyone being able to buy a japanese company
[2022-12-28 15:23:36] <%+Kamurotetsu_> Didn't MS try and buy Nintendo KEKW
[2022-12-28 15:23:37] <%$Dracoraz> a match made in heaven if you ask me LUL
[2022-12-28 15:23:37] <%$sco00bysnacks> fucking nightmare fuel those two together
[2022-12-28 15:23:37] <%+WhiskeyWood> There will only be 3 company’s in the not so distant future.
[2022-12-28 15:23:38] <BallerJColt> Nintendo Cinematic Universe here we go!
[2022-12-28 15:23:38] <%FlowersForAlgorithm> Fox is a movie studio, Sony has their own movie studio
[2022-12-28 15:23:39] <%SWIZZPLS> the disney adults and nintendo adults combine forces.
[2022-12-28 15:23:40] <%$Blastphemy1290> Disney Switch
[2022-12-28 15:23:41] <%cornsbakedgoods> would pokemon not be the marvel of the gaming world?
[2022-12-28 15:23:41] <BahamutOdin> So are we gonna get more X-men movies?
[2022-12-28 15:23:41] <%The_Edwardioe> Captain Marvel x Link movie incoming
[2022-12-28 15:23:43] <%CatsAndDogsLivingTogether> Microsoft should buy Sony for maximum console war lolz
[2022-12-28 15:23:43] <%BloodKlot779> that would be a deathwish
[2022-12-28 15:23:44] <%DickZippem> Super Mario Cinematic Universe OOOO
[2022-12-28 15:23:45] <Circassa> Mawio and Mickey Mouse peepoClap
[2022-12-28 15:23:46] <%JOHUshy> can Disney even afford to buy Nintendo?
[2022-12-28 15:23:46] <%y2zipper> it wouldn't be any different than now.
[2022-12-28 15:23:47] <%eagleheardt> If Disney bought Nintendo, I would just Sudoku
[2022-12-28 15:23:50] <%TheWaterStudent> tbh disney treats fans better than nintendo @BarbarousKing might be a slight step up
[2022-12-28 15:23:50] <%$b4Byrd> Disney bought fox movie division, not all of fox
[2022-12-28 15:23:51] <MostlyPureOrange> Imagine the copyright claims OMEGALUL
[2022-12-28 15:23:53] <%$diogovalente8> they could buy the Sony movie company instead of whole Sony
[2022-12-28 15:23:55] <%Miets> Theres pretty much no precedent in western companies buying japanese companies
[2022-12-28 15:23:55] <mmmmsugar> Ignoring the monopoly implications, Sony itself is too large but Song entertainment division could probably be bought by disney
[2022-12-28 15:23:56] <%+VinnyVelvet> Did you know.. Micheal jackson almost bought marvel so he could play spiderman LuL
[2022-12-28 15:23:56] <%Mr_Panda> Marvel and Mario sports games peepoClap
[2022-12-28 15:23:56] <%+Corbyn_J> @psilocybinsensation it's ryan reynolds' deadpool, and the deadpool movies will be rated R. he'll have cameos in the other movies apparently though
[2022-12-28 15:23:58] <%+Matronix> Marvel + Rabbids is the next game

[2022-12-28 15:24:03] <%+CuJ4Life> If Disney bought nintendo they may actually release games though
[2022-12-28 15:24:03] <%+WhiskeyWood> Amazon could buy Nintendo.
[2022-12-28 15:24:05] <fluffulins> With the Disney development team, there’s a chance Nintendo can release a 60FPS Pokémon game :)
[2022-12-28 15:24:08] <%neily_o> Nintento partnered with Universal for their theme park, don’t think they have a strong relationship with Disney
[2022-12-28 15:24:14] <+FlowSoUnique> is this game like Mario XCom?
[2022-12-28 15:24:21] <%psilocybinsensation> @Corbyn_J Ok ok this sounds pretty good
[2022-12-28 15:24:25] <%$TheMuznick> I remember back in the day when there was a lawsuit about Microsoft violating anti trust laws. Funny how that idea has gone out the window
[2022-12-28 15:24:26] <$Wak017> the weather is the same outside as in this game it's screwing up with my brain
[2022-12-28 15:24:26] <%87ProZach> this the second one?
[2022-12-28 15:24:33] <%Mr_Panda> nintendo doesn't make pokemon
[2022-12-28 15:24:42] <%+valinthyne> isnt midnight suns basically marvel + rabbids? the dialogue is right in line with what the rabbids say
[2022-12-28 15:24:46] <%+ThatGuySenka> as fast as they put out movies, they might do the same with new games
[2022-12-28 15:24:47] <%$Maravedis> When do you think you'll make the announcements?
[2022-12-28 15:24:52] <%$sloth_moves> just curious how is this game? i never once even gave it a chance
[2022-12-28 15:24:55] <Circassa> Mario + Rabbids: Infinity War
[2022-12-28 15:25:01] <%DickZippem> It's hilarious that we have two Mario + Rabbids games but only one main series Mario game
[2022-12-28 15:25:02] <Skrzelik> Would you like to play more Into the Breach in the future?
[2022-12-28 15:25:04] <%JOHUshy> they partially own it though
[2022-12-28 15:25:06] <%PardzKo131831> gamefreak is the developer of pokemon right?
[2022-12-28 15:25:10] <%Mr_Panda> they are, but nintendo is very hands-off, despite it impacts their image as well
[2022-12-28 15:25:11] <Shockingshields> Nintendo has authority over GF, and refuses to fund them further
[2022-12-28 15:25:16] <%+Kamurotetsu_> Nintendo must have some say
[2022-12-28 15:25:17] <fluffulins> @circassa genius
[2022-12-28 15:25:20] <%playmykrat0s> Nintendo lets them put out trash
[2022-12-28 15:25:25] <%87ProZach> If you like this why do you not think you'll like XCOM 2 @BarbarousKing ?
[2022-12-28 15:25:27] <%$Maravedis> Luigi getting bodied.
[2022-12-28 15:25:30] <%Miets> yeah apparently it is in fact gamefreak itself thats responsible for the piss poor quality of the games
[2022-12-28 15:25:30] <%ToaSTy_T0aST> nintendo just markets the game they aren't involved in the game

[2022-12-28 15:27:50] <%Venoxis_> might as well be playing fire emblem Kappa
[2022-12-28 15:27:54] <%Mr_Panda> gamefreak is pokemon company, technically, they were founded to distribute merch/rights and Creatures, inc is for the cards

[2022-12-28 15:34:31] <%$wishfulthink3r> the fighting in Civ is pretty tedious
[2022-12-28 15:34:36] <%Acy37> yeah it's kind of a basic number roll, which means you get stupid scenarios like guys with spears beating tanks sometimes, it's not the main focus though

[2022-12-28 15:34:40] <%manfred_bratwurst> civ is a lot more detailled at administration than TW and a lot less at combat

[2022-12-28 15:34:54] <%alextheordinary> civ isn't a strategy combat game. it just has combat as a facet of the overall game.

[2022-12-28 16:14:28] <afloridaman35> I mean if a video game didn't exist with Snake Pliskin in some form, it would be criminal...
[2022-12-28 16:14:31] <%+WhiskeyWood> Enough of a resemblance
[2022-12-28 16:14:36] <%SquallGCS> like the name Mickey isn't copyrighted
[2022-12-28 16:14:37] <%wilky37> i don't think it was poor-intentioned.. just homage
[2022-12-28 16:14:43] <%$JustMoreZowee> There's no infringement. It's just a name.
[2022-12-28 16:14:45] <Rambaldt> Wasn't there something similar with Donkey Kong and King Kong?
[2022-12-28 16:14:47] <%runtheexe> statute of limitations on that
[2022-12-28 16:15:00] <+lowergasprices> John Carpenter just didn't sue. Prosecutorial discretion.
[2022-12-28 16:15:01] <johnthegg> kojima named a character 'die-hardman' and his real name is john mcclane in death stranding LUL
[2022-12-28 16:15:02] <%+MegaSquishee> They are called character likeness rights.
[2022-12-28 16:15:07] <%$Wafflum> Back then, probably. Now, I think too much time has passed.
[2022-12-28 16:15:10] <%+CousinCatnip> Universal said they were public domain in a different case
[2022-12-28 16:15:10] <%+RolloDaViking> Kojima has origin characters too, like huge chested sniper lady, and desert version of huge chested sniper lady
[2022-12-28 16:15:10] <%MightyCreak> I like this new gameplay design where your have a limited distance for your character, but you can still walk around freely within these limits

[2022-12-28 16:20:20] <%$bald_bubba> Favorite Kingdom Hearts game?
[2022-12-28 16:20:21] <DarkScarletMage> nice adjacent game thou
[2022-12-28 16:20:23] <%+darkart800> same company as final fantasy and same general mechanics
[2022-12-28 16:20:23] <%Miets> no chat it does not, chrono trigger is better than EVERY ff game
[2022-12-28 16:20:28] <johnthegg> i grew up on jrpgs as a kid
[2022-12-28 16:20:31] <%Dyminthos> I do think Barb would enjoy FFT because it’s strategy based and it actually has a compelling story.
[2022-12-28 16:20:32] <%wilky37> @JeromeMorrow too long/slow to stream regardless tho
[2022-12-28 16:20:33] <+lowergasprices> Chrono Trigger is made by some of the same makers of FF7
[2022-12-28 16:20:35] <%$sco00bysnacks> KEKW
[2022-12-28 16:20:37] <%endless_breadsticks> smokealoke LOVES ff and had some struggles with tactics. i don't see it going over well here.
[2022-12-28 16:20:42] <%+Kasumiblue> I love Square Enix shit and I dislike KH
[2022-12-28 16:20:45] <%UsSschi> selfhate
[2022-12-28 16:20:46] <%Aknox23> kingdom hearts is very much like marmite, either love or hate it
[2022-12-28 16:20:46] <%Lucasmacchi> Barb are you going to play Grezzo ? (it's a DOOM motor game, italian, very funny and WTF hahah)
[2022-12-28 16:20:47] <agsoares> I bet you would like the souls like final fantasy
[2022-12-28 16:20:48] <%$joshy0302> I mean, Sakaguchi was one of the people that worked on CT barbShrug
[2022-12-28 16:20:50] <johnthegg> even if you aree into those things, you shouldn't play kingdom hearts, it's nonsensee
[2022-12-28 16:20:52] <DarkScarletMage> Squaresoft was AMAZING back in the day then Enix happened
[2022-12-28 16:20:53] <%karlgerm> Kingdom Hearts is maximum Crungo
[2022-12-28 16:20:53] <%$Wafflum> @Miets I wouldn't argue that but still
[2022-12-28 16:20:54] <%$JeromeMorrow> @wilky37 yeah probably true.
[2022-12-28 16:20:55] <%$ParAilurus> @Miets no one said it wasn't LUL calm your tits
[2022-12-28 16:20:56] <%Dyminthos> @miets I’m a huge FF fan and I agree with your take. Chrono Trigger is top three for me.
[2022-12-28 16:20:57] <+ItzEcks> we need a !willbarbplayit and it just says no
[2022-12-28 16:20:58] <+AdrenALI_N> I feel just the same way, its little more than an homage to two IPs idgaf for finameLUL
[2022-12-28 16:20:59] <%TheParasyte> Krungo Hearts
[2022-12-28 16:20:59] <%MightyCreak> I hope on day you'll play Helf-Life: Black Mesa (the HL 1 remake by the community). It is soooo good!
[2022-12-28 16:20:59] <%StragoRph> Crono trigger is a lot more story light and shorter than other FF games
[2022-12-28 16:21:02] <%GnuHope> Bard you've never played Fire Emblem but what's your favorite Fire Emblem game? LUL LUL
[2022-12-28 16:21:03] <%$Razzy_Fresh> barb loves FF 7 remake barbToxic
[2022-12-28 16:21:04] <johnthegg> @DarkScarletMage blame it on the final fantasy movie
[2022-12-28 16:21:05] <Nodrog4444> have you ever played XCom?
[2022-12-28 16:21:05] <%ApeironCalamity> Some people really don't have a read on Barb at all
[2022-12-28 16:21:05] <Varsidian> You love goofy and donald and the whole gang, I see you wielding your iconic barbarous keyblade
[2022-12-28 16:21:08] <%Dingusamingus> What about Phlobieyu and Kwimbleeeee
[2022-12-28 16:21:10] <%+munchypooh> Kingdom hearts has fallen off in quality and the early games have also aged poorly. Square Enid has pretty much lost what made it special since like 2001
[2022-12-28 16:21:10] <OneMillionBC> Favorite Ex Primal game?
[2022-12-28 16:21:11] <+garyoakguy> kh is one of the worst games to reccomend to someone who isn't intrested
[2022-12-28 16:21:12] <draco_mundos> in fairness, you are into punishing yourself, so maybe KH would be the game for you
[2022-12-28 16:21:12] <%+friskykoala74> KH is insanely Crungo
[2022-12-28 16:21:13] <%UsSschi> D:

[2022-12-28 16:21:21] <%+pokefromhome> KEKW
[2022-12-28 16:21:22] <%Miets> I watched Tofu play KH games, I now know 100% those games are omega cringe
[2022-12-28 16:21:22] <%+awmwrites> The first two Kingdom Hearts games are still worth playing as action rpgs. Ignore everything else though
[2022-12-28 16:21:24] <%Tim_fishh> can't believe they killed goofy in kingdom hearts 2
[2022-12-28 16:21:25] <%+Sorry4HavingFun> i like when goofy says GOYLE
[2022-12-28 16:21:26] <+AdrenALI_N> Atelier Ryza for me thx adrenaYAYA
[2022-12-28 16:21:28] <%$crittrTV> goofy is SCUFFED. donald is BASIC

[2022-12-28 16:21:32] <%Whyeverso> If you love Kingdom Hearts you fucking HATE Donald Duck KEKW

[2022-12-28 16:21:37] <%raphrodisiac_> Goofy brah
[2022-12-28 16:21:37] <%$ToxicYosh__> no one gives a shit about KH
[2022-12-28 16:21:37] <%$Blastphemy1290> Barb would like Harvest Moon for snes
[2022-12-28 16:21:44] <%$joshy0302> My favorite part is where Goofy says "It's Goofin' time."
[2022-12-28 16:21:45] <%+69_cats> *Glory kills Goofy
[2022-12-28 16:21:46] <%UndefinedOrb> We only play adult games here like Mario
[2022-12-28 16:21:48] <%$Blastphemy1290> KEKLEO
[2022-12-28 16:21:49] <degehsj> there is some stretch between kingdom hearts and doom eternal
[2022-12-28 16:21:51] <afloridaman35> SquareEnix has just pigeon holed themselves into an RPG factory... They used to do other stuff like Einhander that was was different and good. But they can't be bothered anymore...
[2022-12-28 16:21:54] <%Air_of_Mystery> Barb is this better than the first one?
[2022-12-28 16:21:56] <%$lollipopkraken> Did Bimp like Hotline Miami? I missed the 24hr stream :c
[2022-12-28 16:21:58] <johnthegg> i liked the first kingdom hearts as a kid but they lost me after that
[2022-12-28 16:22:01] <%$FengWeiWay> DDoomer
[2022-12-28 16:22:04] <%KnusperBKN> Eternal Darkness would be worth playing. Very underrated.
[2022-12-28 16:22:06] <%Dyminthos> @endless_breadsticks What did Smoke not like about FFT?
[2022-12-28 16:22:10] <GiantSushii> Big stretch LUL
[2022-12-28 16:22:10] <Varsidian> nah dude, they're one and the same
[2022-12-28 16:22:13] <%+Sorry4HavingFun> im convinced that no one in this stream actually watches or listens to barb since chat recommends have always been awful

[2022-12-28 16:33:42] <afloridaman35> woke means to shove any political bullshit into someplace it does not belong, like a pop concert or a sports event. People use that shit as a way to disconnect from the world's bullshit and have fun. Can't do that when it gets crammed down your throat anyway...
[2022-12-28 16:33:45] <johnthegg> the thing is, that new games of thrones show is way more 'woke' than rings of power imo and people didn't get too upseet about it, it's strange

[2022-12-28 18:24:05] <%SquallGCS> Moon Knight was super disappointing
[2022-12-28 18:24:05] <%firecrotch007> I didn’t think moonknight was bad
[2022-12-28 18:24:08] <%+Tocnir> A sludge of samey plots that make me feel like I've already seen a movie before it even comes out

[2022-12-28 18:24:27] <%benjammin172> shang chi was fine, NWH was pretty good for nostalgia, eternals was one of the worst superhero movies made, and the rest of phase 4 ranges from meh to awful

[2022-12-28 18:24:57] <+JeanVaIjean24601> he says it on his alt channel: Mooler
[2022-12-28 18:24:57] <%baconinyourface> Marvel is shit these days but you should try Peacemaker. It’s pretty good
[2022-12-28 18:24:58] <%+AdamSabre> Hasan is a hypocrite

[2022-12-28 19:19:09] <%+Beefyfife> @barbarousking and then you shut him down mercilessly and he countered with a “well actually Tolkien sold it first” and made some other dumb points
[2022-12-28 19:19:10] <%thorry84> Tolkien just wrote some bad storylines and characters for the series

[2022-12-28 19:22:43] <%$reservoir_dawgs> Tenet is the typical Nolan movie since Dark Knight Rises. Horrible characters, terrible dialogue, awful sound mixing, incredible directing and production
[2022-12-28 19:22:44] <%+Beefyfife> @bloody_raw what was chosen??
[2022-12-28 19:22:45] <%+MPainTrain> I don’t understand the rings hate, I have never read the books is that a big part of it?
[2022-12-28 19:22:46] <%$Mi4_Slayer> Also you will get more game time for ur bucks if you really have to pick one
[2022-12-28 19:22:48] <%Seda_Give> Dread is good. Just short
[2022-12-28 19:22:48] <+planetaryvision> I remember Odyssey FeelsStrongMan Clap
[2022-12-28 19:22:51] <%$ShinDigPig> Unfortunately Metroid is also a once every 10 years game Smoge
[2022-12-28 19:22:52] <%mik53afk> damnit, I guess I should go try odyssey then.
[2022-12-28 19:22:53] <%$jk_uk89> It will be ten years before the next
[2022-12-28 19:22:53] <%$Bloody_Raw> @Beefyfife watch party is gonna be Leopard vs Gorilla on repeat
[2022-12-28 19:22:55] <KingTootinCommon> odyssey made by best nintendo studio
[2022-12-28 19:22:57] <%$Anthony3> No botw NODDERS
[2022-12-28 19:22:59] <dmof> odyssey knocked my socks off.. was not expecting that. you'll get more time out of mawio
[2022-12-28 19:23:00] <%solarsystemwulf96> Watch next Mario game just be a shell hack by Nintendo
[2022-12-28 19:23:00] <%StrongBelwas1014> ya'll get stuck on one thing you don't like about a show or movie.  Don't miss the forest for a tree
[2022-12-28 19:23:02] <%buttercupsupreme1> and metroid dread is a once every 15 years type game with how Nintendo treats metroid KEKW
[2022-12-28 19:23:02] <%TheDankLordSauron> Odyssey can only be described as magic. Made me feel like I did when 64 came out
[2022-12-28 19:23:04] <%Jamza_> Dread is extremely good, but Odyssey is a masterpiece.
[2022-12-28 19:23:05] <%+solidpeyo> BOTW is boring, at least for me
[2022-12-28 19:23:05] <kirby_kingdom> Smoge @ShinDigPig
[2022-12-28 19:23:08] <%drpointypen> yeah I'm playing Odyssey for the first time and it is so much fun

[2022-12-28 19:23:10] <%$qzcx> dread was a great surprise, but not a masterpiece
[2022-12-28 19:23:11] <%+Zaiz_En> Odyssey is the Rings of Power of Mario games.

[2022-12-28 19:23:13] <%$DancingSasquatch> @electrolith tenet is that average movie, but somehow I've seen it 5 times this year.
[2022-12-28 19:23:15] <%HugBringer> Dread is great, Odyssey just has so much Amazing stuff
[2022-12-28 19:23:16] <%$jimbobsandwich> idk, dreads ending was definitely omg wtf for me
[2022-12-28 19:23:19] <%ToaSTy_T0aST> still no odyssey 2 Smoge
[2022-12-28 19:23:24] <%+AdamSabre> If you like Dread, play the 3DS Metroid
[2022-12-28 19:23:24] <+Algork_> I liked dread but there are better metroidvanias, odyssey is in its own category
[2022-12-28 19:23:26] <%$Fozberg2003> SMB3 was always my favorite game until SMO came out. Odyssey is something special.
[2022-12-28 19:23:28] <%mik53afk> what makes odyssey like that?
[2022-12-28 19:23:28] <%Joypen> noooo
[2022-12-28 19:23:31] <%$Mi4_Slayer> thats ...
[2022-12-28 19:23:33] <%+agchee> I'll take Dread over Odyssey. But it's very close & I just like Metroid over Mario.
[2022-12-28 19:23:33] <%+GaimeGuy> that was the last jump. Maybe
[2022-12-28 19:23:34] <%$OgrefromMT> MIDWAY PLEASE!
[2022-12-28 19:23:36] <%Weltnarok> Odyssey is best bang for your buck, Dread is super good but short if you're good at following that formula
[2022-12-28 19:23:45] <%$jimbobsandwich> it's a combination of perfection
[2022-12-28 19:23:49] <+planetaryvision> @BarbarousKing How come people don't RomHack Mario 64 style of games with their own levels?
[2022-12-28 19:23:49] <%DKCreo> the mechanics of Odyssey are perfect
[2022-12-28 19:23:50] <%Seda_Give> I wish dread was more than 8 hrs
[2022-12-28 19:23:50] <+MAIKmihawk> odessey speed runs are so fun to watch
[2022-12-28 19:23:50] <dkozak> Barb don’t you find odyssey too easy though
[2022-12-28 19:23:51] <%Raiyzar> Dread was sooooo goooooodddd
[2022-12-28 19:23:51] <%Electrolith> @dancingsasquatch It took me a long time to see it the first time, and I didn’t regret it.
[2022-12-28 19:23:52] <%$FengWeiWay> physics and level design, sucks that there are too many stars
[2022-12-28 19:23:52] <%+zerofoot> the story of odyssey is revolutionary
[2022-12-28 19:23:52] <+lord_kurama_> Mario in a wedding dress
[2022-12-28 19:23:55] <%$reservoir_dawgs> Odyssey is so amazing. It’s sad we haven’t heard anything new about Mario in five years
[2022-12-28 19:23:56] <%solarsystemwulf96> Lore
[2022-12-28 19:24:00] <%+JAR_of_stuff> And Soundrack!

[2022-12-28 19:24:04] <%bobopedic33> It looked like the objectives were sort of easy
[2022-12-28 19:24:04] <%SuperMegaMimi> I think you need some sort of innovation or big risk for it to be on that top level of oh my god it’s one of the best
[2022-12-28 19:24:06] <%ToaSTy_T0aST> NODDERS
[2022-12-28 19:24:07] <%+breadwatcher> @planetaryvision sm64 hacks exist

[2022-12-28 19:24:08] <%DoctorBlowfly> agreed
[2022-12-28 19:24:08] <%flipvanmorritz> misunderstood for a second there and wondered why Barb was comparing Dredd to Mario Odyssey
[2022-12-28 19:24:09] <%Turkeyman5> aurShock aurShock aurShock aurShock
[2022-12-28 19:24:11] <+eezye> Odyssey added a new way to platform in already platform heavy game
[2022-12-28 19:24:11] <%y2zipper> odyssey is the best Mario ever made
[2022-12-28 19:24:13] <%Missing_Node> ...Sunshine. Kappa
[2022-12-28 19:24:13] <%Kingsgrave_> ive seen a lot of people complain about the frequency of the moons in odyssey but I liked the game a lot @BarbarousKing
[2022-12-28 19:24:13] <%aramister> Dread is better metroidvania than oddysey though
[2022-12-28 19:24:16] <%+GaimeGuy> he snubbed sunshine
[2022-12-28 19:24:18] <%+Zaiz_En> Sunshine.
[2022-12-28 19:24:18] <%+Centralizer> miyamoto's time tied up in fucking Super Chris Pratt so no odyssey 2
[2022-12-28 19:24:18] <%$deltahedge0> Sunshine
[2022-12-28 19:24:19] <soondy> galaxy 2 KEKLEO
[2022-12-28 19:24:19] <+Neonerd1> Better than Bowers fury?
[2022-12-28 19:24:19] <%$FengWeiWay> Doesn't compare to Mario 64
[2022-12-28 19:24:20] <$cjazzyjay> thank you for not mentioning sunshine
[2022-12-28 19:24:21] <%$The_Dog_Rules> Galaxy is better
[2022-12-28 19:24:24] <%$The_Dog_Rules> barbFightMe
[2022-12-28 19:24:24] <%+MPainTrain> is Mario rpg considered 3d?
[2022-12-28 19:24:24] <%$Overkill_Killer> @MPainTrain it wasn't amazing, but it was ok and even fun at times. I appreciate expanding lore for established story worlds
[2022-12-28 19:24:26] <%waywardfrantz> i feel like there isnt an argument against odyssey being the best
[2022-12-28 19:24:26] <%FlowersForAlgorithm> @Missing_Node LUL
[2022-12-28 19:24:27] <%ToaSTy_T0aST> galaxy 1 and 2 are good but are long games
[2022-12-28 19:24:28] <soulswizzle> I've been watching some streamers play hide and seek on Odyssey
[2022-12-28 19:24:29] <%mik53afk> damn, I've been holding out for them to drop the price but don't think I'll ever win that battle
[2022-12-28 19:24:30] <Botecelli> and his name is joooohhhnnnn ceeeeenaaaaa
[2022-12-28 19:24:30] <%+Killsmith_> Dread is a 2D Metroid.  That automatically makes it a once every 20 years kind of game.
[2022-12-28 19:24:33] <+DProto_3> hollow knight > dread
[2022-12-28 19:24:33] <%foryourhealth> And that BOOBA mayor
[2022-12-28 19:24:34] <%manfred_bratwurst> dread is "they still have the old magic", oddyssey is "they have that new magic"
[2022-12-28 19:24:38] <%$jimbobsandwich> my only complaint about odyssey was the ending cutscene. crungos
[2022-12-28 19:24:41] <%+breadwatcher> @Kingsgrave_ thats my only complaint and its a minor one
[2022-12-28 19:24:47] <%+GaimeGuy> Plus it has that awesome vaudeville number
[2022-12-28 19:24:48] <%$reservoir_dawgs> I just don’t understand the Mario galaxy hype. I hate the waggle of thr Wii

[2022-12-28 19:24:58] <%$Aelerathe> Odyssey was so boring I literally fell asleep playing it multiple times that I eventually just never booted it up again.

[2022-12-28 19:25:15] <%Kingsgrave_> hollow knight is massively overrated
[2022-12-28 19:25:15] <+Maibhla> I think thats a clear cut case of being wrong lol
[2022-12-28 19:25:18] <%$jimbobsandwich> hollow knight was way more open
[2022-12-28 19:25:19] <%Electrolith> Gotta say, nothing quite like getting stoned and picking up Star Bits for my buddy when Galaxy first came out.
[2022-12-28 19:25:19] <%Dingusamingus> I prolly like HK more but they're both terrific games
[2022-12-28 19:25:20] <%Saxtirical> I think it's pretty clear cut

[2022-12-28 19:25:21] <%+GaimeGuy> I had the biggest stupid grin on my face dureing the parade in Odyssey
[2022-12-28 19:25:22] <%cornsbakedgoods> hollow night = $20 and more to do
[2022-12-28 19:25:24] <%$Doctor_TP> I had someone tell me they’d rather play a new Pokémon than Mario odyssey. I was left speechless

[2022-12-28 19:25:29] <+planetaryvision> Odyssey is for babies. Real men play Shrek Racing.
[2022-12-28 19:25:29] <%thorry84> Hollow Knight has so much more content
[2022-12-28 19:25:29] <+Algork_> HK does have real bosses and better exploration but it comes down to if you like metriod in general better
[2022-12-28 19:25:29] <%+solidpeyo> Metroid Dread is more fun IMO

[2022-12-28 19:25:37] <%Missing_Node> @GaimeGuy Yea, one of the best moments of the game.
[2022-12-28 19:25:37] <%SuperMegaMimi> Dread is excellent it just was rushed at the end
[2022-12-28 19:25:38] <HaggisBodine> I prefer hollow knight due to the art style
[2022-12-28 19:25:41] <%jnass63> @soulswizzle that was surprise for a lot of people me included.  I really loved it
[2022-12-28 19:25:43] <%SuperMegaMimi> The only knock I had on it
[2022-12-28 19:25:44] <%aramister> Is mortal shell worth playing for free?

[2022-12-28 19:25:45] <%$jimbobsandwich> both games had incredible atmosphere and dynamics

[2022-12-28 19:25:46] <%dulcet_tone> hollow knight is lame imho
[2022-12-28 19:25:56] <%WiLDRAGE777> @dulcet_tone it's ok to be wrong
[2022-12-28 19:25:56] <%khog> I prefer Hollow Knight because it is vastly more challenging

[2022-12-28 19:26:00] <%c_parts> What are Barb's impressions of this hack 10 hours in?
[2022-12-28 19:26:01] <%+solidpeyo> ?
[2022-12-28 19:26:02] <MarvinOGravel> I enjoyed both games *shrug*
[2022-12-28 19:26:07] <%Seda_Give> Its only 8 hrs long
[2022-12-28 19:26:08] <%Dingusamingus> Dread still didn't have pegging so it's pretty mid
[2022-12-28 19:26:08] <%keith46256> I DO feel like nintendo needs to get their heads out of their asses and lower the prices on older games more
[2022-12-28 19:26:09] <%nirv_anait> how is it rushed?
[2022-12-28 19:26:10] <%Kingsgrave_> I thought dread was well paced
[2022-12-28 19:26:12] <%Jasmith524> @barbarousking would you say Mario maker 2 super expert levels are cake compared to these levels?
[2022-12-28 19:26:13] <%Weltnarok> Dread is the best Metroid game to come out since Super Metroid imo
[2022-12-28 19:26:14] <%fall3nPhD> I didn't think Dread was rushed at the end barbShrug
[2022-12-28 19:26:15] <%Kelsynn> I think hollow knight is a masterpiece but metroid dread was refreshing as a metroid fan
[2022-12-28 19:26:19] <%FlowersForAlgorithm> @aramister no. It still costs your time
[2022-12-28 19:26:20] <%ToaSTy_T0aST> how was it rushed?
[2022-12-28 19:26:20] <plisskey> dont feel like dread was rushed
[2022-12-28 19:26:21] <%Jaylang11> thats the new ish one right?
[2022-12-28 19:26:24] <%manfred_bratwurst> hollow knight is just indie dev at its best, with like 2 years post release updates
[2022-12-28 19:26:25] <%+agchee> I didn't feel like it was rushed. I thought it was good all the way through. barbShrug
[2022-12-28 19:26:27] <%Kingsgrave_> dread was a pretty tight and short game, not really sure what was rushed about it
[2022-12-28 19:26:27] <%+iGrowwearyofthisworld> Final boss slapped, didn't feel rushed to me
[2022-12-28 19:26:28] <%pigmanny> I havent played it cause I don't have a switch
[2022-12-28 19:26:29] <%+breadwatcher> @keith46256 they must still sell well enough that they dont have a business need to
[2022-12-28 19:26:31] <%WiLDRAGE777> @Weltnarok I kind of agree.  3d metroids just don't hit the same
[2022-12-28 19:26:32] <%nirv_anait> I feel Dread is really polished
[2022-12-28 19:26:33] <%+kll21> man fuck these levels lol
[2022-12-28 19:26:35] <Ronin_theDamn> @c_parts it's a great hack if the creator shys away from the mario maker spin jump formula
[2022-12-28 19:26:39] <+PandaKnightTV> Dread was my pick last year for GotY out of the candidates
[2022-12-28 19:26:49] <%SuperMegaMimi> Once you got the final exploration upgrade it was like 5 mins away from the final boss
[2022-12-28 19:26:52] <%Dingusamingus> Or you can get a Hillary jump KEKW
[2022-12-28 19:26:56] <%Saxtirical> People expected dread to innovate more I think. It also had tons of new metroidvaina design to look at and be insipred byand didn't seem to bother.
[2022-12-28 19:26:58] <%SuperMegaMimi> Which felt disappointing that you didn’t get to utilize that upgrade

[2022-12-28 19:58:00] <%morsecodec> Hell mode just starts you on heat 5, I think…
[2022-12-28 19:58:02] <%+williard18> it gets rid of i-frames also so it's actually harder

[2022-12-28 20:43:05] <%$Mi4_Slayer> If anything else, if it more or less the same, it would just give us more hades to play between 1 and 2

[2022-12-28 20:50:18] <%ShowtimeTylers> @Miets I am so nervous about buying an expensive controller because of drift
[2022-12-28 20:50:21] <%+MiloMinderbinder> ive already had to send two ps5 controllers back to sony for repairs under the warranty
[2022-12-28 20:50:23] <%$GlaceonYo> choo choo

[2022-12-28 20:50:41] <+MAIKmihawk> drift = more money for manufacturer
[2022-12-28 20:50:48] <%$fobbe> use the RE4 Chainsaw controller, ez

[2022-12-28 20:50:57] <%a_decoy> @Br1ck4 the haptic triggers do take a bit of getting used to.  can understand the dislike
[2022-12-28 20:51:01] <%richi_lopez_> Use the DK bongos
[2022-12-28 20:51:05] <%demontrane> use the donkey kongos
[2022-12-28 20:51:05] <%Miets> I've been using my DS4 on my switch for the past 3 years and it still works perfectly
[2022-12-28 20:51:06] <fluffulins> At least you have a career in NFS with all the drifts
[2022-12-28 20:51:16] <%+stoveboy22> I was working on making a more ergonomic SNES controller but ran out of funds for the PCB development. it's a lot of work making a custom controller

[2022-12-28 21:27:16] <%$FengWeiWay> @Timey77 maybe em3 is better middle ground untill you are on really high heats

[2022-12-28 21:44:35] <%Electrolith> @dj_sesame I actually find it easier. Now you don’t have to run into the zone. Just have to shoot someone close to you.

[2022-12-28 21:45:42] <%jps166> is it the aphrodite synergy that makes the doom reset after it triggers?

[2022-12-28 21:47:18] <%+MiloMinderbinder> the bonus dmg from stacking isnt that high
[2022-12-28 21:47:33] <%$kingofgames323> That's some goddamn damage you're doing
[2022-12-28 21:47:37] <%Electrolith> My last achievement was the one for purging a legendary boon. Did it on a throwaway run, but it still hurt.
