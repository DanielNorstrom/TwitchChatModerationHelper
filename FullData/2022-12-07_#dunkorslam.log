[2022-12-07 12:57:12] <%MiczuPL> Propane tank spells are the way to go when it comes to taking down the final boss. Just imagine the sheer power and destruction that a well-placed propane tank spell can unleash. It's like a mini-explosion right in the boss's face. And with the added bonus of a wand to direct and control the spell, you'll be able to take down even the toughest boss with ease. So forget those wimpy magic spells and go with the tried-and-true method of using propane tank spells in a wand.
[2022-12-07 12:57:15] <%Letaali> with the giga nuke you had earlier, that alone would have done it iirc

The government doesn't want you to know the truth, but the facts are clear: salt intake is directly correlated with high blood pressure, heart disease, and stroke. Yet the food industry continues to pump it into our meals, all in the name of profit. It's time to take a stand and demand change.

In fact, you should probably throw it out right now‚Äîyou don't need it anyway. But if you're still addicted to salty foods like chips and pretzels, then I've got good news for you: there are plenty of other ways to get more sodium into your diet without having to resort to that evil shaker.
