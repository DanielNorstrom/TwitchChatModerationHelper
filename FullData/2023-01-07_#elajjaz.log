[2023-01-07 12:38:16] <%LewdAvocado> @MeisterDejv I'm pretty sure the original is based ona song from some other mod. There's a lot of references to old Gothic mods in this. And yeah, they recorded everything from scratch, did a lot of remixing while recording and did some original pieces for the mod.

[2023-01-07 14:58:26] <%too_lazy_for_this> @YaoHosen yeah, so i forgot that they rereleased the game 2 times. First one was a complete game with DLC and semiControl. The gameplay stays the same as the other games. But Portable is more LN and you can walk in dungeon only, tho from what i was hearing Portable is better and you can choose from Male MC and Female. Portable is going to be released soon, so would advise to check it if it's to your liking and if not then you can emulate the proper one

[2023-01-07 17:09:55] <Arkaro> Greetings streamer! It's me, your dear chatter. I've taken to this chat in regards to what I expect is a simple oversight on your part (might I suggest re-evaluating the prescription for your glasses?) in regards to the title of your stream. As cited by a trusted entity within Google, "The exclamation mark (! ), known informally as a bang or a shriek, is used at the end of a sentence or a short phrase that expresses a very strong feeling." Thereby, I suggest correcting "!Archolos" to "Archolos!"

[2023-01-07 17:36:57] <Shirokuma78> Dear chat. Words cannot express how much I hate you guys. As we fight our way into the great unknown only that one thing remains certain, that I hate you guys with every tired muscle in my bohemian body. We have taken Pribyslavitz and now I must rally the men onward to Talmberg because I will not stop until we won it all and you guys are my slaves because I hate you guys, I hate you guys so very very much. Yours general Henry
