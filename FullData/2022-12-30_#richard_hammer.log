[2022-12-30 14:35:45] <%thexLed> we usually ice fish like less then a meter of water, at most maybe 3
[2022-12-30 14:36:19] <%+Achadna1> a meter? thats like 10 feet, right?

[2022-12-30 14:37:51] <%thexLed> yea, but that's 1meter of water, with like 40-50cm of ice
[2022-12-30 14:38:48] VIEWERS: 233
[2022-12-30 14:39:03] <%thexLed> yea, but I usually fish for perch, and they often prefer the more shallow water, like 1.5meter is the sweetspot
[2022-12-30 14:39:20] <%thexLed> our weeds die out during winter
[2022-12-30 14:39:48] <%+Achadna1> negative oxygen
[2022-12-30 14:39:52] <%thexLed> ours are dead before we get ice
[2022-12-30 14:40:48] VIEWERS: 233
[2022-12-30 14:41:11] <%thexLed> it depends on where I fish, most the water around me isn't much deeper than 3meters
[2022-12-30 14:41:29] <%+Achadna1> europe doesnt have deep water
[2022-12-30 14:41:30] <%+Achadna1> its true
[2022-12-30 14:42:47] <%+Achadna1> like 60 feet?

[2022-12-30 14:43:00] <%thexLed> I have like one lake has like a crack at the bottom, because it's between two mountains, soo it's has like an even 5-6meters, and then at this spot it just drops to 15meters

[2022-12-30 14:45:57] <%ReformingOne> Richard didn't you say you don't know how to swim? or learned late maybe
[2022-12-30 14:45:59] <%thexLed> yea, our perch like to lay around the edge between 1meter and where it usually drops of to like 2meters, because the bait fish we got usually swim in the shallows
[2022-12-30 14:46:22] <%+Achadna1> i dont think i know a single person who cant swin

[2022-12-30 14:48:53] VIEWERS: 237
[2022-12-30 14:50:35] <%thexLed> we get a period from like end of February to end of march/mid april, where it's hopeless to go ice fishing, because there's too much water on top of the ice, soo the pressure above the ice gets to high, and the water gets less oxygen in it, soo it's almost like the fish just hibernates for that period
[2022-12-30 14:50:53] VIEWERS: 237

[2022-12-30 14:52:39] <%thexLed> yea, because usually by that time, the ice has gotten to it's max thickness for the year, and then on top of that, it's like 40cm to 1meter of snow, and usually like 10cm of water in that snow as well, soo the pressure above the ice gets to great compared to below the ice

[2022-12-30 14:56:13] <%thexLed> because the snow is an isolator, soo it slowly melts during the days, but freezes again during the nights, but since the water is below the snow, it gets insulated from the cold

[2022-12-30 15:27:13] <LatinumeTV> You'd think so, but the roads are so convoluted and most of it is one way, so it takes roughly 2.5h to drive across

[2022-12-30 15:27:54] <+Tarotking> about to say, lets not promote bald tires
[2022-12-30 15:27:56] <Fynagle> Slow down and do NOT try to steer if you are skidding. That only makes it works.
[2022-12-30 15:27:59] <%thexLed> In Sweden it's law that you have to use snowtires
[2022-12-30 15:28:00] <Wrenshrike> If you're in a tiny front wheel drive nugget, you're getting nowhere without snow tyres here in Norway.
[2022-12-30 15:28:01] <Liamclan> AWD and a manual gearbox helps loads with control in bad weather
[2022-12-30 15:28:38] <%ReformingOne> Malta is a total of 15 miles across why does anyone need a car there what lmao
[2022-12-30 15:28:41] <$Fiishcore> And you're right. I drive slow as heck in the winter. Rather get there slow then be in the ditch.

[2022-12-30 15:41:16] <+Rambeard> just really good all season tires do the trick. tires just made for winter are a scam.
[2022-12-30 15:41:16] <Dorkstrat> its not ment to drive on ice. Its to be able to stop in the cold better than normal tires though
[2022-12-30 15:41:40] <Wrenshrike> I'd agree that studless snow tyres are a scam.
[2022-12-30 15:41:57] <$Bernhard_Grapple> A seatbelt also distributes force across your body in the event of an accident affecting the driver cabin. And hold you still.
[2022-12-30 15:42:00] <Fimbultul1> there are different snow tires, in icy climate you want snow tires with studs.

[2022-12-30 15:42:34] <$Bernhard_Grapple> The only stud allowed on Richard's car is himself.

[2022-12-30 16:03:47] <+Rufish> I live in Canada and Never had frozen pipes, and In Kentucky it RARELY got cold enough to freeze our pipes so I never had it there either
[2022-12-30 16:04:01] <$Bernhard_Grapple> That might contribute a bit, but rapid temperature changes are more likely to cause breaks.
[2022-12-30 16:04:19] <%Danphion> i've only had mine freeze a couple times
[2022-12-30 16:04:32] <Dorkstrat> we use something called pipes in pipes now, also most of the copper pipes we have has been good quaility

[2022-12-30 16:40:29] <%+Rufish> Chapter 5 of the story which is the last chapoter is slated to release for free in 2023

[2022-12-30 17:36:19] <dingo2345> I don't know if this is the right place, but there is this therapy you can do where you can roll over your head with a bunch of needles and apperiently it grows the hair back somehow
[2022-12-30 17:36:20] <AC_ThirtySix> too poor
[2022-12-30 17:36:21] <%$RumNDone_> yea you just have to look like your scalp is birthing tiny bugs for a few months
[2022-12-30 17:36:23] <dingo2345> does that work?
[2022-12-30 17:36:25] <MaterialBlade2> go to the gym and work out your hair
[2022-12-30 17:36:28] <%+Achadna1> just wear a toupee cowards
[2022-12-30 17:36:29] <+Gallagher2x2> all life's problems can be solved with memory foam
[2022-12-30 17:36:30] <NeuroSynapse> yup many problems are solved by not being poor
[2022-12-30 17:36:31] <%+markc0501> Why fix it when hats and beanies work fine?
[2022-12-30 17:36:38] <@%jaaski> i got a solid mix of both. i got the build of my mum's side, but i saw a vid of my dad in the early 80s and god damn if we didn't look the same in our 20s
[2022-12-30 17:36:41] <$unknownohyeah> the way to regrow your hair is to burn several thousand dollars of cash and rub the ash on your head
[2022-12-30 17:36:51] <%+JDSmith90> no
[2022-12-30 17:36:53] <%+Achadna1> based
[2022-12-30 17:36:54] <Spac3d> Damn I always thought it was the strength of your character which defines you, not the mop or not you dont have on your head... Go figure

[2022-12-30 17:37:14] <+rasnerr> today people are not bald anymore, they are just too poor to stop sucking @Richard_Hammer
[2022-12-30 17:37:27] <MaterialBlade2> click your heels together and think hairy thoughts
[2022-12-30 17:37:30] <%Dorkstrat> katieLul my grandfather told us that bold men are the greatest lovers. I took it he was experienced. No big worries
[2022-12-30 17:37:30] <Levitticuz> I can hear my hair growing
[2022-12-30 17:37:30] <%+SlashSteel11> my thoughts are so hairy and I'm not bald so that's probably what it is

[2022-12-30 17:38:01] <%$kuakae> my favorite animals  as a kid were monkeys. maybe that helped with staying hairy
[2022-12-30 17:38:10] <Chanceofpouring> bald c heck
[2022-12-30 17:38:11] <%Lakart> Shiver got that alopecia
[2022-12-30 17:38:12] <$unknownohyeah> the hair migrates from the head to their face or lower
[2022-12-30 17:38:16] <%bdres> its because baldness and body hair are both expressions of testosterone production
[2022-12-30 17:38:17] <@%Shiverwarp> That is an exaggeration
[2022-12-30 17:38:24] <%thexLed> People don't lose the hair on their head, it just migrates to the rest of their body, makes sense
[2022-12-30 17:38:41] <$unknownohyeah> alopecia totalis does exist
[2022-12-30 17:38:48] <%+Achadna1> common bald people L
[2022-12-30 17:39:00] <%+SlashSteel11> Ole' hairless big dick Shiver
[2022-12-30 17:39:08] <%Lakart> The invention of the hat caused baldness, news @ 11
[2022-12-30 17:39:09] <%thexLed> 'cause some women find bald people good looking, soo I assume that's why?
[2022-12-30 17:39:13] <%+JDSmith90> i've never burned in my life.
[2022-12-30 17:39:16] <%op_status> weren't you just saying it is not just genes?
[2022-12-30 17:39:16] <+bATrAIDER> bald people are aerodynamic
[2022-12-30 17:39:17] <+Gallagher2x2> we evolved to be more aerodynamic
[2022-12-30 17:39:17] <%+JDSmith90> I am half black though.
[2022-12-30 17:39:20] <@%Shiverwarp> "Supposedly" it was extremely attractive in the past so it got bred into us, but who knows how bullshit that is
[2022-12-30 17:39:24] <Boveip> chicks dig three baldness so it persists
[2022-12-30 17:39:25] <%RabidWolf27752> I think getting rid of cancer or mental disorders is higher on the list than baldness, just a bit
[2022-12-30 17:39:28] <domenko_art> @thexLed thats some bald people cope
[2022-12-30 17:39:39] <%Dorkstrat> its not about having great hair rooOld its all about having a good headshape
[2022-12-30 17:39:39] <%+JDSmith90> I've never burned in 32 years of my life.
[2022-12-30 17:39:48] <Spac3d> I know right, lets just start messing with our genes... Not like that couldnt go wrong in the slightest.
