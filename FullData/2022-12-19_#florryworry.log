[2022-12-19 12:50:09] <@%viking_nephilim> Challenge 2 should be relatively easy - As you're in asia, you can humiliate, grab something in africa, get Isfahan in Persia, Mentese, trakai castle and Taj Mahal, get 5 vassals, 30 dev, 5 provinces with centre of trade....you can easily get between +9 and +13 splendor per month (depending on how much you push the monuments)
[2022-12-19 12:50:16] <twardy007> ok mr streamer thanks for answering :)
[2022-12-19 12:50:18] <%LukeDMT> Ad? What ad EZ

[2022-12-19 15:53:33] <tolstoyyyy> @IloveBigrip93 that's because it wasn't a pasta. here's how you write a pasta: first of all you need to make a second account, so your second account can repost the pasta your first account mae. to get the ball rolling, you see. then the pasta needs to be really long, like too long for anybody to read, because then people will just go 'haha it's long that's funny.' and try to use some direct speech in the pasta, people love that shit. so that's what i would do if i were trying to write a pasta.
