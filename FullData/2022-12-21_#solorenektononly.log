[2022-12-21 19:25:13] <%$holyshazbot> 2080 working hours in a year on average multiply any hourly wage by 2000 and you get roughly the annual wage

[2022-12-21 19:38:28] <PatsFanMike> They say that money doesn't change your life over 100K a year so I think at that point is when you have additional money where kids can be a way to use that excess money
