[2023-01-04 01:46:48] <PMA_Eagle> i think its histamine intolerance for that reason

Despite her looking like a wolf, tanuki have the ability to shapeshift and easily trick others, whether it’s for fun, for company, or even for their prey. As you can also see to keep her pack’s loyalty, she soothes them with noises from objects she’s collected and her own voice. I’m gonna try and get closer

[2023-01-04 23:51:43] <stratosedge> It's very strange, I have noticed that now a days people think that anything with unexpected death is a mature movie or series, but it wasn't like that 2 decades ago. Sometimes I feel they meaninglessly kill characters.
[2023-01-04 23:53:04] <yanseph_mogz> have you seen mieruko-chan? it's a horror anime/manga
[2023-01-04 23:53:07] <%$TheBoxofRage> What did Simba say to his kid when he was moving too slow... You need to Mufasa snailleSmug

[2023-01-04 23:53:35] <stratosedge> When I watch old movies people die but not everyone for no reason. LOTR is a good example, characters do die but most of the cast is tsill intact and fight the final battle.

[2023-01-04 23:55:51] <Tyrie2001> That's got me trying to remember which I saw first as a kid now, Mufasa's death scene, or Bambi's Mom getting turned into a Sunday roast
[2023-01-04 23:56:13] <stratosedge> Yeah like you know the character we introduced the previous episode they are dead now. And the character we introduced 10 minutes back they are dead too.

[2023-01-04 23:58:35] <stratosedge> Btw talking about killing characters watch The anime Juni Taisen. In terms of death it's GOT on steroids.
