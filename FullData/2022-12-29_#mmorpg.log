[2022-12-29 17:27:44] <%maximumpenguins> Alright, want to start a discussion on this. I've been thinking a lot about people's resistance to 2011scape making it's way into the game. I firmly believe people are just afraid of those additions not because they were bad or weren't fun, but rather that they were associated with EOC and micro transactions. People are really bad at looking at things independently with OSRS.
