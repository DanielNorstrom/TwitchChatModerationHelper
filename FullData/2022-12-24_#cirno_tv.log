[2022-12-24 14:11:23] <%kirbydance> i used to spend money on things like that. digital stuff in games. eventually this game you are playing you will stop playing one day. and these cards or whatever you are getting will be useless

[2022-12-24 14:12:14] <MSDOO7> you are paying for the experience, the actual product is...well worthless KurisuFact
[2022-12-24 14:12:22] <@%Toonfish> like if I buy a game for 60€ or spend 60€ on a gacha game makes basically no difference to me

[2022-12-24 14:13:00] <@%Toonfish> but that's also why as a rule of thumb I'll only spend like a fifth or so of my playtime on an f2p game
[2022-12-24 14:13:02] <%kirbydance> im not saying you cant spend. but trying to spend to get some loot that has a really low drop chance is not good

[2022-12-24 14:13:59] <%AchievementSlayer> @Toonfish I will only spend money on games I have put a massive amount of time into.
[2022-12-24 14:14:08] <%AchievementSlayer> skadiWhale or games that are worth it
[2022-12-24 14:14:19] <MSDOO7> people spend millions on expensive cars, planes, etc, dumping some money on a video game is like peanuts

[2022-12-24 14:14:50] <%kirbydance> i bought the extra skins in amongus because the game was fun. all i am saying is skins or characters should not be gambling them to you. if you want a skin or charcter just charge a flat price for it
[2022-12-24 14:15:13] <MSDOO7> but a lot of people enjoy the gamba aspect of it
[2022-12-24 14:15:26] <MSDOO7> or else gachas wouldn't be popular
[2022-12-24 14:15:41] <@%Toonfish> kirbydance if you spend money to get a specifics item but it's behind gambling I agree that's bad
[2022-12-24 14:15:55] <@%Toonfish> but if you spend money so you get to gamble a bit for that experience itself I think that's fine cir3
[2022-12-24 14:15:58] <MSDOO7> it's bad, yet a lot of people like it KurisuFact
[2022-12-24 14:16:01] <@%Toonfish> within reason
[2022-12-24 14:16:15] <MSDOO7> I'd say let them have their fun
[2022-12-24 14:16:16] <@%Toonfish> people who have gambling problems should be protected and not explicitly preyed upon imo
[2022-12-24 14:16:28] <%kirbydance> agreed
[2022-12-24 14:16:47] <MSDOO7> that's a different subject
[2022-12-24 14:17:11] <%kirbydance> ehh not entirly different
[2022-12-24 14:17:19] <@%Toonfish> ye that's why I added it as an additional point and didn't try to argue against you with it naroEhehe
[2022-12-24 14:17:21] <MSDOO7> very, I was talking about rich people
[2022-12-24 14:17:45] <MSDOO7> the talk changes quite a bit if we include those that aren't
[2022-12-24 14:18:50] <%kirbydance> well then you also have games like diablo immortal that you have to spend like 500k to be at the top of its gear list. and that was with good luck estimate

[2022-12-24 14:20:40] <@%Toonfish> raid is the funniest game to me when it comes to whaling. No matter how much you whale, your day-to-day gameplay will ALWAYS be grinding. Everything in the game is grinding. The further you get to the top, the less effective your grinding becomes as upgrades become rarer and rarer.
[2022-12-24 14:20:46] <%parallelfifthpolice> light7Think
[2022-12-24 14:20:49] <@%Toonfish> So the only thing you're doing by whaling is actively making your experience worse

[2022-12-24 14:20:56] <%Sanglune> cirLurk
[2022-12-24 14:21:21] <%kirbydance> idk i never played raid. or really any mobile game like that
[2022-12-24 14:21:22] <MSDOO7> yeah it's similar to FGO, the more you whale, the more you become a slave to the game, pretty weird
[2022-12-24 14:22:18] <@%Toonfish> you really didn't miss much kirby
[2022-12-24 14:22:44] <%kirbydance> the closest was a 6v6 sea based game where you tried to beat the other team as you sailed around the map. i only played that so a streamer i watched would get 200$ when i got to lvl 20. took like 2 months
[2022-12-24 14:22:50] <@%Toonfish> most mobile games are just other games but the content is stretched out very thin to facilitate monetization
[2022-12-24 14:23:33] <%kirbydance> well monetization is why mobile gaming is the largest chunk of gaming profit
[2022-12-24 14:23:51] <@%Toonfish> I will give Raid this, the game has really fun strategic depth once you get out of the early game and the gear upgrading/management is fun
[2022-12-24 14:23:58] <@%Toonfish> but man the grind is just way too much
[2022-12-24 14:24:03] <@%Toonfish> and the monetization is way too intrusive
[2022-12-24 14:24:26] <%parallelfifthpolice> light7Concern
[2022-12-24 14:25:16] <MSDOO7> I don't mind grind as long as it's only a couple of minutes per day, long term grinds are fine
[2022-12-24 14:25:31] <@%Toonfish> yeah that's the issue doot
[2022-12-24 14:25:36] <MSDOO7> but if it's like a 2nd job, hard pass
[2022-12-24 14:25:40] <@%Toonfish> at the higher levels you need 2 hours a day minimum for your daily grind in raid
[2022-12-24 14:25:50] <%kirbydance> 2020 mobile gaming was 48% of all gaming revenu
[2022-12-24 14:25:53] <MSDOO7> yeah that's I quit Epic7

[2022-12-24 14:29:14] <@%Toonfish> don't forget clicking away all the shop offers that pop up every single time you return to the main menu (that time adds up) and clicking all the little rewards you get distributed across 5 different menus

[2022-12-24 15:27:35] <%kirbydance> and twitch probably pushes everyone a bit. it makes them more money anyways. that twitch chat is probably just commenting on the followed channels tab and how it is sorted by reccomended for you

[2022-12-24 17:39:22] <@%Toonfish> statista is pretty legit zaraji, it's just that the site is annoying to use and sometimes the data they have is incomplete
[2022-12-24 17:39:37] <%kirbydance> maybe some sources are also counting the money it dumbed into facebook metaverse. if they spent the money its not revenue i guess

[2022-12-24 17:40:32] <@%Toonfish> @kirbydance revenue is the same as gross income IIRC, so no deductions of operational costs

[2022-12-24 17:42:09] <%kirbydance> that was the first one i looked at statista but i went away from that site because it said Gross revenue generated by Epic Games worldwide from 2018 to 2025
[2022-12-24 17:42:16] <%kirbydance> so they are time travelers now
[2022-12-24 17:42:43] <@%Toonfish> kirbydances the 2022-2025 numbers are probably projections naroEhehe
[2022-12-24 17:42:58] <@%Toonfish> I'd check the sources to confirm that but I don't have a statista account cirBak
[2022-12-24 17:42:59] <%kirbydance> it could say projections but they didnt
[2022-12-24 17:43:03] <Bloodhit> Yeah all the sites just say predicted revenue, can't find any that says actual ones

[2022-12-24 17:43:48] <Bloodhit> I bet epic store is so minus in profit they never disclosed any real numbers cirPomp
[2022-12-24 17:43:56] <@%Toonfish> not sure if I understand your question correctly but money that epic games spends is not deducted from the revenue number

[2022-12-24 17:53:47] <%kirbydance> so the only numbers that are accurate are the ones from 2018-2020 because epic said its numbers

[2022-12-24 17:56:52] <@%Toonfish> kirbydance nice, thank you for sacrificing your statista accountlessness naroSalute
[2022-12-24 17:57:17] <%kirbydance> i will probably never use the site again
[2022-12-24 17:57:24] <Bloodhit> > because epic said its numbers XDoubt
[2022-12-24 17:57:31] <%kirbydance> its source was itself
[2022-12-24 17:57:55] <%fcloud> and now you know why they require an account to see the sources
[2022-12-24 17:58:33] <@%Toonfish> I mean it's fairly obvious that 2022-2025 are estimates naroSlain
[2022-12-24 17:58:57] <@%Toonfish> and they do actually employ people who are experts at that kinda stuff cirnoShrug
[2022-12-24 17:59:14] <%kirbydance> they have a faq
[2022-12-24 17:59:38] <%kirbydance> How is the data collected? Our statistics, surveys, and forecasts are based on the primary data gathered by our research teams and on secondary data from our partners. Find out more about our working method. (its a blue link)
[2022-12-24 18:00:21] <%kirbydance> Where can I find the data of this statistic? You can find information on the data of this statistic in the tab "Source", including a link to the source.
[2022-12-24 18:00:50] <%kirbydance> Am I allowed to publish the data? You are only allowed to publish the data if you have a Corporate or Enterprise Account.
[2022-12-24 18:00:59] <%fcloud> it's not necessarily bad that they estimate. if they're good at it, they probably can come up with a better estimate than you or me. private companies dont have to release shit, so if epic doesn't want to talk, estimates are the best you're going to get
[2022-12-24 18:01:01] <%kirbydance> oh noes cirCop

[2022-12-24 18:02:39] <%kirbydance> they probably just look at player count for fortnut from 2018-2020 and see what that was. then get a good number for 2021 and 2022
[2022-12-24 18:04:04] <%kirbydance> beyond 2022 no real data to look at. they can look at growth rate and guess what it will be
[2022-12-24 18:05:29] <%kirbydance> seems statista is saying fortnight does not count as gross revenue... seeing that now
[2022-12-24 18:06:01] <%kirbydance> nvm i misread
[2022-12-24 18:06:07] <%kirbydance> i was about to say
[2022-12-24 18:06:27] <Bloodhit> But does epic store makes any dosh skadiWhale
[2022-12-24 18:06:53] <MSDOO7> 2022 was Epic Store's best year ever according to them
[2022-12-24 18:07:41] <MSDOO7> over 800m alone from Epic Store, so add Fortnite and UE4/5 and other projects, the 5.7b estimate is feasible
[2022-12-24 18:07:45] <%fcloud> actually due to its size, fortnite income is technically not classed as "gross revenue" but the rarely-invoked "obscene revenue"
[2022-12-24 18:07:47] <%kirbydance> they are saying also that epic games store is not collecting a free for developers that publish games on the store
[2022-12-24 18:07:57] <%kirbydance> fee*
[2022-12-24 18:08:06] <%kirbydance> according to epic
[2022-12-24 18:09:38] <%kirbydance> and only charging 12% for store revenue vs everyone else like steam google apple charging 30%
[2022-12-24 18:10:22] <@^StreamElements> Holiday 2022 Merch is now LIVE! https://streamlabs.com/cirno_tv/merch
[2022-12-24 18:15:58] <%kirbydance> i do agree that 30% is alot to give away just to have someone host a game for you
[2022-12-24 18:16:16] <%kirbydance> and apple is a bitch to get an app on their devices
[2022-12-24 18:16:24] <%fcloud> doesn't matter because consumers care about the price they pay, and that price is not enough lower on egs to overcome steam's tremendous advantages
[2022-12-24 18:16:55] <%kirbydance> it wasnt just steam
[2022-12-24 18:17:15] <%kirbydance> 30% is basically the industry standard
