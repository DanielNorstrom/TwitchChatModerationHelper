[2022-12-23 17:27:27] <@^Nightbot> Before you begin investing, please complete these three steps. 1. Save a minimum of 3-6 months worth of liquid cash as an emergency fund. 2. If your employer offers a matching 401K then contribute up to at least the maximum amount they will match (it's free money). 3. Pay off any high interest debts you may have (credit cards, loans, etc.) and after you have accomplished all three, then we can speak about investing.

[2022-12-23 17:52:58] <%miketherage> @thestockguy The goal of the USA is to make the whole world a democracy.   The “world order”.   I would like to think most of our forces are for good.  There are still countries that are living in a regressive social place.  Since the US inception the world has moved forward tremendously.
