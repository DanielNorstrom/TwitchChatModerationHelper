[2022-12-07 17:55:26] <AlbinoOwlBearr> but hey, in my opinion they really are making moves. they are updating previous maps @mrkrakens one or two at a time. and the new map actually FEELS like a battlefield map
[2022-12-07 17:55:33] <%+Dudetastique> least they dont have alot of cav
[2022-12-07 17:55:36] <AlbinoOwlBearr> @astorath_the_grim_ SeemsGood

[2022-12-07 17:56:31] <%+sockoms> t5 mercs arent that bad are they?
[2022-12-07 17:56:33] <%MrKrakens> @AlbinoOwlBearr yeah i agree, I just wish there was more cover like the bf4 maps. also .. they need to bring back the bf4 maps lmao
[2022-12-07 17:56:37] <+Majinator_> oh that's cool thank you!
[2022-12-07 17:56:49] <AlbinoOwlBearr> @majinator_ it kinda depends. it's more like your own plan, the base idea is become king of the whole map, bring another kingdom to the ruler of the whole map.
[2022-12-07 17:57:02] <%B00Gnasty> did we play tarky this morning?
