[2022-12-08 01:20:16] <CryptoNobes> Hi @nepenthez I was wondering what your thoughts are on FutSheriff? Do you think him leaking everything takes away the hype for fifa promos or no?
[2022-12-08 01:20:16] <$deathskamikaze> ***

[2022-12-08 01:20:33] <uA_Bilo> Castros driver made a sudden move an the other car on tha other lane went over the barrier
[2022-12-08 01:20:36] <+SerdarIsmail> someone said it was his driver that made the other car flip, it definitely wasnt
[2022-12-08 01:20:37] <@%Viperlization> A car did flip
[2022-12-08 01:20:40] <subhan_i98> No, they were on the motorway, castros driver was about to move in the left lane and the car swerved to avoid castros car
[2022-12-08 01:20:42] <+SkillerBLN> you can see the driver turning the wheel to the left while leaning forward laughing but you cant see whether he touches the other car
[2022-12-08 01:20:45] <@%Viperlization> But was nothing to do with the driver
[2022-12-08 01:20:45] <dominic_meier12> his driver swerved
[2022-12-08 01:20:46] <%itsonlyfangs> they turned off the stream .. didnt effect him

[2022-12-08 01:21:16] <JakeSab> Car lost control as they were passing Castro’s car and flipped infront of his car. Castro’s car swerved to avoid. Castro is safe
[2022-12-08 01:21:17] <+GPNR11> Nep it’s on twitter gopro999
[2022-12-08 01:21:21] <UrMumisCalledSteve> yea the car is upside down

[2022-12-08 01:21:49] <%+QwadBhoy> Nah it defo looks like the driver of Castros car caused it, he makes a sudden move towards the other car before it flips
[2022-12-08 01:21:50] <CryptoNobes> @callumboscoe from FutSheriff?
[2022-12-08 01:21:53] <%+609blazers> holy shit thats crazy
[2022-12-08 01:21:53] <%+futbolistic97> I don't think his driver had anything to do with it, the other car just lost control
[2022-12-08 01:21:59] <humza_c> castro is hopefully OK the other car did not hit his car
[2022-12-08 01:22:00] <%+rishray> big win
[2022-12-08 01:22:01] <+brianmcgee99> Castro driving is looking, its not like hes distracted

[2022-12-08 01:22:21] <Zeloo> Looked like castros driver saw it in his mirror, then swerved to avoid it
[2022-12-08 01:22:21] <subhan_i98> @QwadBhoy you can't really make that statement, you can't really see what they're looking at
[2022-12-08 01:22:31] <octopus479> dhhsdj

[2022-12-08 01:22:48] <dominic_meier12> im not sure but it looked like castros driver swerved in to the other lane so the other car had to swerved into the barrior
[2022-12-08 01:22:56] <+jamietwitch_> hope castro and everyone involved is good
[2022-12-08 01:22:56] <Zeloo> A car came out of nowhere and started going upside down and all over the place beside them
[2022-12-08 01:22:59] <Mezy> youre just gonna have to watch it to make your own judgement tbh

[2022-12-08 01:23:24] <+jamieharris_96> Castros driver swerved to cause the other driver to move and the car flipped
[2022-12-08 01:23:31] <CryptoNobes> Hopefully nobody was hurt
[2022-12-08 01:23:32] <Young_Hova> i mean console or ehatever

[2022-12-08 01:23:45] <humza_c> castros car did not get hit it was the other car that flipped
[2022-12-08 01:23:54] <Messagge> @jamieharris_96 you simply dont know that and can possibly know what castos driver saw in his mirrir
[2022-12-08 01:23:56] <Orlandoking18> I can’t pass the damn ball! Dr bruyne and modric makes errors. WTF EA?!
[2022-12-08 01:24:11] <jimbob2222221> hopefully not too bad with traffic, its past 3am over there at this stage
[2022-12-08 01:24:16] <fxJulian> its really bad

[2022-12-08 01:24:18] <mmake999> I mean, let's hope that their car did not get hit anymore @NepentheZ
[2022-12-08 01:24:28] <%+kainyk> Wow the car ends up right in front of them sideways. There’s a longer clip
[2022-12-08 01:24:30] <%+olliefoley2004> Lahm 87 icon pack W or L
[2022-12-08 01:24:31] <%+QwadBhoy> @subhan_i98 Just looks like he is checking his mirror before changing lanes
[2022-12-08 01:24:31] <stemil19> what happened, just tuned in?
[2022-12-08 01:24:33] <octopus479> what's a good way to make coins nep
[2022-12-08 01:24:35] <%+Quilva> hopefully no one was hurt
[2022-12-08 01:24:41] <humza_c> @jimbob2222221 there was no other traffic
[2022-12-08 01:24:50] <unbrednut> Wtf happened
[2022-12-08 01:24:52] <CryptoNobes> Hi @nepenthez I was wondering what your thoughts are on FutSheriff? Do you think him being a main leaker takes away the hype for fifa promos or no?
[2022-12-08 01:25:01] <Lew2708> people just trying to  blame  someone
[2022-12-08 01:25:01] <%+rishray> is castro in qatar?
[2022-12-08 01:25:01] <Zeloo> Castros driver definitely saw it coming, he saw it in his mirrors
[2022-12-08 01:25:03] <+tkdublin> castros driver is a lunatic
[2022-12-08 01:25:04] <%+olliefoley2004> W or L lahm 87 icon pack?
[2022-12-08 01:25:05] <+dannysuper97> That was mental man
[2022-12-08 01:25:06] <fxJulian> you can see his driver swerving left causing the hit
[2022-12-08 01:25:07] <ratiooooo69> It looked like it if u saw the clip once
[2022-12-08 01:25:09] <subhan_i98> @QwadBhoy yeah thats why i was saying it aint the drivers fault, he done the right thing, done the safe thing
[2022-12-08 01:25:12] <+SerdarIsmail> if you listen, his driver even says in that split second it was the other drivers fault
[2022-12-08 01:25:13] <curlyrico> current gen looks so fun
[2022-12-08 01:25:15] <jimbob2222221> @humza_c infront yes, but following behind idk
[2022-12-08 01:25:17] <yousefthiabat> castro driver saved them .. he noticed the cars crashing and saved them
[2022-12-08 01:25:23] <petergarfield10> is that sudden moove, might have scares the other driver
[2022-12-08 01:25:32] <meneely> is your streak counter alright there mate lol
[2022-12-08 01:25:34] <octopus479> is morentes good
[2022-12-08 01:25:36] <mmake999> no, I think the car hit behind them
[2022-12-08 01:25:36] <%+kainyk> I think he hits the brakes and it swerves
[2022-12-08 01:25:39] <+dannysuper97> Castro’s driving 10 minutes before was dancing and singing and having no hands on the wheel..
[2022-12-08 01:25:42] <humza_c> yes only 1 car crashed
[2022-12-08 01:25:43] <+dannysuper97> Doesn’t look good..
[2022-12-08 01:25:49] <+los_7_> Pray for Castro
[2022-12-08 01:25:50] <%+QwadBhoy> @subhan_i98 Why would he swing the car towards the other one thats sliding upside down though
[2022-12-08 01:25:53] <%+rishray> no driver tries to crash on purpose im sure it was for a reason
[2022-12-08 01:25:53] <+shaqhinds03> The car flipped
[2022-12-08 01:25:55] <%Brandez84> Castor’s driver wasn’t looking at the road much was he in general
[2022-12-08 01:26:02] <%+Quilva> Castro's driver takes his hands off the wheel alot and talks and dances
[2022-12-08 01:26:04] <%+kainyk> Yeah he hit the brakes  and Castro a car would’ve swerved a bit
[2022-12-08 01:26:07] <+georgeeoneill> I bet half this chat don’t even drive
[2022-12-08 01:26:12] <octopus479> way to make coins nep
[2022-12-08 01:26:14] <Messagge> just seems like the guy came up on them fast from maybe behind and he was trying to go left to go out of the way. then that car cut left to try to pass
[2022-12-08 01:26:15] <petergarfield10> hope everyone involved is fine
[2022-12-08 01:26:16] <+mikejew> bare in mind this is all at 3am, other driver could be intoxicated. But don't want to assume anything...
[2022-12-08 01:26:17] <+shaqhinds03> Castro is fine it’s just the other car
[2022-12-08 01:26:17] <+Lashroman> Where can you see it
[2022-12-08 01:26:20] <$yayatoure12399> pray for the people in the car that crashed
[2022-12-08 01:26:20] <mmake999> let's hope that any car did not drive through them after that @NepentheZ
[2022-12-08 01:26:21] <+Dennis7NL> The car probably had to react due to the swerving of the driver
[2022-12-08 01:26:21] <kruusetheman> sitting and blameing someone here instead of praying everyone is ok is so absurd.
[2022-12-08 01:26:23] <%+Arkuvio> The movement happened after the other car was already mounting the side wall
[2022-12-08 01:26:24] <+tkdublin> he wasn't looking at the road before, they were always telling him to watch the road
[2022-12-08 01:26:25] <+NazNUFC> Does kinda look like Castro driver may have caused that
[2022-12-08 01:26:27] <nep199> Castros driver was dancing and stuff didnt look at the road once hope everyone is ok though
[2022-12-08 01:26:27] <+dannysuper97> Castros driver 10 minutes before hand was singing and dancing with no hands on the wheel
[2022-12-08 01:26:35] <+SerdarIsmail> Castro was telling his driver every 5 minutes to have both hands on the feel, just telling him to be safe
[2022-12-08 01:26:36] <%+RJBascombe7> people saying the driver swerved left breifly and it put him off....end of day chat it's impossible to tell we just got to hope everyone's ok
[2022-12-08 01:26:37] <octopus479> have u tried schwemstiger and is he good ?
[2022-12-08 01:26:38] <+KevinXD_19> Just got quick recap please
[2022-12-08 01:26:42] <subhan_i98> @subhan_i98 he was probably gonna move over, checked the mirror realised the speed he was coming and then stopped, defo did the safe thing, else that car would've hit into castro
[2022-12-08 01:26:44] <+m_sway> He stayed in his lane
[2022-12-08 01:26:48] <dominic_meier12> @NazNUFC i think so too, he swerved inte the otcher lane
[2022-12-08 01:26:53] <+imbakaran> Nep, it looks like Castro's driver making that sudden move caused the car behind to swerve hard. Castro's driver was not looking at the road because of his joke
[2022-12-08 01:26:55] <Itschopz> After watching the clip multiple times I can't see where castros driver could possibly be at fault
[2022-12-08 01:26:55] <90sMixtape> LUL
[2022-12-08 01:26:57] <mmake999> idk who is the mr. smart here but please. you don't know
[2022-12-08 01:27:00] <lozzer360> Moral of the story dont do a twitch stream in a car!?!!!!!!
[2022-12-08 01:27:00] <+alex_jacobs96> Looks to me like castros driver changes lane (whether you think he’s distracted or not) and the other car has to do a manoeuvre to avoid
[2022-12-08 01:27:02] <%+kainyk> Yeah it’s when it suddenly stops that causes injuries
[2022-12-08 01:27:03] <xkingga> Seems like castros driver swerved and it freaked out the other car
[2022-12-08 01:27:08] <kingkurdo00> the clip is gone go viral
[2022-12-08 01:27:09] <+Dennis7NL> He was swerving left
[2022-12-08 01:27:12] <%Hero_CHW> yeah I just watched his vod
[2022-12-08 01:27:14] <+imbakaran> he's laughing at Castro's joke looking down
[2022-12-08 01:27:16] <mmake999> he was laughing
[2022-12-08 01:27:18] <+thenorwegiandrogba> Will the icon sbc be refreshed tommorow?
[2022-12-08 01:27:20] <Itschopz> I think he notices the car and looks at it
[2022-12-08 01:27:21] <+MARVELLOO> I think his driver freaked out
[2022-12-08 01:27:25] <+SerdarIsmail> he was laughing bc castro told him pita was his sister
[2022-12-08 01:27:28] <%+callumboscoe> If you go back to about 3:30 before the end of the stream Castro tells the driver to put his hands on the wheel. Keeps taking his eyes off it.
[2022-12-08 01:27:30] <nep199> He was joking for like 20 minutes without looking
[2022-12-08 01:27:30] <+ansgar_7> Castros driver was dancing at the red light. Castro clearly was telling him to keep his hands while in motion. Not his fault
[2022-12-08 01:27:31] <%+kainyk> His driver actually did well in fairness
[2022-12-08 01:27:34] <+VanGoalen> Instead of looking at the driver, look at the lane he is in. He was in his lane. all of a sudden a car behind him crashes. God, this chat...
[2022-12-08 01:27:37] <lozzer360> Moral of the story dont do a twitch stream in a car!?!!!!!!
[2022-12-08 01:27:41] <+dannysuper97> Reckless driving
[2022-12-08 01:27:42] <%+RJBascombe7> his driver reacted quick TBf
[2022-12-08 01:27:47] <+Rhijn> Is this old gen? Why you got the pregame formation thing
[2022-12-08 01:27:50] <SkateboardGi> yo guys have you have ever seen a car flippin on the highway?? wtf? idk how i could possibly react to that
[2022-12-08 01:27:51] <proxybambi> he was in his lane
[2022-12-08 01:27:59] <humza_c> @callumboscoe no he always says that to him as a joke his driver is very safe tho

[2022-12-08 01:28:10] <meneely> moral of the story is what is the story cus i've just arrived
[2022-12-08 01:28:19] <+imbakaran> @vangoalen that's true. but even if I'm in my lane, you're next to me and I make a sudden jerk move, you will react
[2022-12-08 01:28:22] <yungmaseyy> That definitely looked like the other cars fault
[2022-12-08 01:28:23] <mmake999> let's hope that any car did not drive through them after that :l
[2022-12-08 01:28:29] <kruusetheman> people care more whos in the wrong insted of praying everyone is ok what a shit humans you are.
[2022-12-08 01:28:31] <wuzz__> @meneely TWITTER
[2022-12-08 01:28:34] <+Dennis7NL> The other car might have overreacted to the car swerving left, that was my thought at first
[2022-12-08 01:28:36] <%+callumboscoe> @humza_c I’m not saying he’s not but he literally takes his hands off and considering this one doesn’t know his name or anything about him is it his usual driver?
[2022-12-08 01:28:42] <Itschopz> Driver stays in his lane the entire time its not his fault
[2022-12-08 01:28:44] <%$itsthatja> ps4?
[2022-12-08 01:28:44] <+VanGoalen> @imbakaran if you're next to me, I can't make a move cause youre next to me???
[2022-12-08 01:28:46] <Andyvv19> Habdulla did good he stayed in his lane hope everyone in the accident is okay
[2022-12-08 01:28:47] <dominic_meier12> its an accident guys no ones fault
[2022-12-08 01:28:48] <+Jasonschaefer14> Same @dennis7nl
[2022-12-08 01:28:59] <$Scott_z99> the car must on been coning diagonally.  no way he way next to him
[2022-12-08 01:29:02] <humza_c> @callumboscoe yeah it's his usual driver
[2022-12-08 01:29:05] <+brianmcgee99> @Itschopz exactly
[2022-12-08 01:29:06] <ratiooooo69> @dominic_meier12 exactly
[2022-12-08 01:29:07] <+rkumar119> Oh wow nep knows aswell
[2022-12-08 01:29:15] <%+callumboscoe> Fairs @humza_c
[2022-12-08 01:29:23] <+rkumar119> I watched it live and I was so shocked and now imagine how they are feeling
[2022-12-08 01:29:23] <+bandagehead> The car was 3 lanes away
[2022-12-08 01:29:39] <humza_c> @rkumar119 bro I shat myself
[2022-12-08 01:29:42] <+imbakaran> @vangoalen coming in just to the left of me I meant. I've been in those situations and when the car in overtaking makes a sudden move haunts me
[2022-12-08 01:29:50] <castroupdates> @rkumar119 i am still shocked bro my heart
[2022-12-08 01:29:59] <+bandagehead> The craziest thing I’ve seen live
[2022-12-08 01:30:00] <+rkumar119> Yh same
[2022-12-08 01:30:12] <aalqinai_q8> I’m shitting bricks rn for them hope everyone’s ok
[2022-12-08 01:30:14] <humza_c> @bandagehead same
[2022-12-08 01:30:18] <+VanGoalen> @imbakaran You always have those deadspots. Based on the clips it seems like the crash happened behind them
[2022-12-08 01:30:21] <+SN7P3R5_FCB> Car was 3 lines away on left
[2022-12-08 01:30:21] <curlyrico> just stop talking bout it, hope everybody is okay
[2022-12-08 01:30:21] <ratiooooo69> @bandagehead fkn crazy alright
[2022-12-08 01:30:24] <jimbob2222221> its so obvious the majority of people who think of blaming the driver have never/cant drive
[2022-12-08 01:30:26] <+rkumar119> @humza_c before that incident it was one of the best steams I’ve ever watched
[2022-12-08 01:30:26] <%+rishray> nep every time i RB dribble to the players strong foot then hit a finesse it tends to go in, not sure if it’s something worth testing
[2022-12-08 01:30:26] <+brianmcgee99> The driver says OMG before he moves the wheel
[2022-12-08 01:30:41] <+rkumar119> I hope abduliah is fine
[2022-12-08 01:30:45] <$Scott_z99> maybe it just happened before he turned
[2022-12-08 01:30:51] <%+QwadBhoy> Like ive been in that situation overtaking someone who makes a sudden movement into my lane, you have to take evasive manouevers which in the guy that crashed case looks like what happened, especially since he was going at a fair speed
[2022-12-08 01:30:55] <+imbakaran> @vangoalen I pray that's the case. in any case, they seem they were not hurt.
[2022-12-08 01:30:58] <humza_c> @rkumar119 yes bro I enjoyed that stream before the incident
[2022-12-08 01:31:10] <unbrednut> That’s obvious the driver clearly saw the accident coming in the rear view mirror
[2022-12-08 01:31:13] <+tkdublin> to wins away from div 2, do I take some Ls??😅
[2022-12-08 01:31:17] <yungmaseyy> That car was for sure already spinning out before castros driver made a manoeuvre
[2022-12-08 01:31:18] <+bandagehead> Bro Abdullah’s wife was worried about him earlier it’s crazy
[2022-12-08 01:31:18] <+tkdublin> *2
[2022-12-08 01:31:29] <+brianmcgee99> @QwadBhoy Listen to it with sound, he says OMG before he swerves, hes seen the car crashing
[2022-12-08 01:31:32] <+VanGoalen> @imbakaran Just seemed like a slippy slide from the other car, usually you're protected. If something happened behind them it could be bad. Let's just wish for the best
[2022-12-08 01:31:49] <$Scott_z99> if that car hit. u would saw and felt the hit
[2022-12-08 01:31:52] <+johhn89> wow!! still live????
[2022-12-08 01:31:54] <+rkumar119> @bandagehead I don’t think he will be allowed to hang out with them or pita is going to want to go home
[2022-12-08 01:31:56] <%+rishray> spreadsheet fifa needs a spreadsheet on shooting i reckon
[2022-12-08 01:31:59] <+rkumar119> Idk
[2022-12-08 01:32:14] <thamer6464> that trip is over for Castro
[2022-12-08 01:32:19] <+bandagehead> @rkumar119 definitely traumatic
[2022-12-08 01:32:28] <ratiooooo69> @thamer6464 how
[2022-12-08 01:32:30] <Orlandoking18> Ref needs a buff
[2022-12-08 01:32:32] <+rkumar119> @bandagehead 100%
[2022-12-08 01:32:32] <Mckelvey> Yo nep
[2022-12-08 01:32:35] <Orlandoking18> Too many mistakes
[2022-12-08 01:32:38] <+tkdublin> everyone has mbappe
[2022-12-08 01:32:41] <tk4u> i feel so bad for castro he was having such a great stream
[2022-12-08 01:32:44] <+imbakaran> @vangoalen agree. not having seen what was happening behind them is biasing my brain. looking at Castro and driver joking around not looking at road when he's answering him and laughing... but it could be 2 things correlated not caused by it
[2022-12-08 01:32:57] <hogozan> @rkumar119 chill with the speculation bro
[2022-12-08 01:33:01] <+rkumar119> @ratiooooo69 idk from watching their streams she is defo wanting to go home
[2022-12-08 01:33:04] <+tkdublin> me neither
[2022-12-08 01:33:05] <shahzebsr7> @tk4u i hope it's not their fault
[2022-12-08 01:33:08] <+brianmcgee99> Everyone we play has Mbappe just not us
[2022-12-08 01:33:08] <+johhn89> any suggestions how i can make my plyers release the pass when i press pass and not 2 sec later??
[2022-12-08 01:33:10] <+bandagehead> Everyone praised that stream sad it ended like that
[2022-12-08 01:33:12] <+tkdublin> but everyone else🤣
[2022-12-08 01:33:14] <jxckjager77> omg
[2022-12-08 01:33:14] <thamer6464> @ratiooooo69 His driver was distracted by him then caused an accident
[2022-12-08 01:33:20] <Mckelvey> @tk4u What happened
[2022-12-08 01:33:26] <curlyrico> @tkdublin the only was i enjoy fifa is 5 star skillers and dribbling to score lol
[2022-12-08 01:33:28] <tk4u> when i replayed it i seen the abduls steering wheel jerked left idk if thats abduls fault or the driver behind them bumped into their car

[2022-12-08 01:33:35] <+rkumar119> @hogozan oh no I hope that everything is fine still
[2022-12-08 01:33:36] <ratiooooo69> @thamer6464 ik but that doesn't mean he has to cancel his entire trip tho
[2022-12-08 01:33:45] <+Obreezy99> Raiiiid
[2022-12-08 01:33:45] <+VanGoalen> @imbakaran The driver was pretty wild in combination with Castro and friends feeding into that. Still, he was their driver for the whole trip. If Castro thought he was a bad driver he wouldve switched. I think it's a accident.
[2022-12-08 01:33:46] <+brianmcgee99> @thamer6464 stop capping, you haven't seen the clip
[2022-12-08 01:33:48] <+CFCDondre> tomleeBald tomleeBald tomleeBald tomleeBald
[2022-12-08 01:33:48] <ratiooooo69> @thamer6464 driver didnt crash btw
[2022-12-08 01:33:49] <+dangraham69> @thamer6464 WTF are you on about, that had nothing to do with Castro or the driver
[2022-12-08 01:33:58] <mmake999> @tk4u I think it bumped or pushed
[2022-12-08 01:34:04] <xTomLs_> 😭
[2022-12-08 01:34:04] <+fitim7united> i love how in this game it's easier to score bikes off corners than 1v1s

[2022-12-08 01:34:10] <xTomLs_> who you playing coop w nep
[2022-12-08 01:34:11] <+imbakaran> @vangoalen I'm reaching a similar conclusion
[2022-12-08 01:34:14] <+mikejew> if you clearly look at the rear mirror, theres one frame that shows the car is already going to the left
[2022-12-08 01:34:14] <Orlandoking18> Game is not difficult, problem is the servers. Heavy gameplay
[2022-12-08 01:34:15] <ratiooooo69> It didnt push im pretty sure
[2022-12-08 01:34:16] <thamer6464> @ratiooooo69 How about the people in the other car no he’s finished
[2022-12-08 01:34:19] <+rkumar119> I find it quite disrespectful for the people who crashed that the video is all over Twitter
[2022-12-08 01:34:23] <declan_1577> @vangoalen nah I don’t think it was abdulahhs fault
[2022-12-08 01:34:23] <tk4u> i honestly just hope the car that flipped noone is injured i dont think it matters whos fault it is
[2022-12-08 01:34:24] <greeneejosb> What happened in castros stream chat ?
[2022-12-08 01:34:33] <ratiooooo69> @thamer6464 how bro? It wasn't even their fault?

[2022-12-08 01:34:38] <+rkumar119> @greeneejosb car crash
[2022-12-08 01:34:39] <+VanGoalen> @declan_1577 We can only speculate
[2022-12-08 01:34:48] <ratiooooo69> @rhijn like that cruyff knowledge haha
[2022-12-08 01:34:50] <%+callumboscoe> @rkumar119 think he knew mate
[2022-12-08 01:34:53] <greeneejosb> @rkumar119 Oh no ….
[2022-12-08 01:34:55] <declan_1577> @vangoalen prayers man
[2022-12-08 01:35:13] <thamer6464> @ratiooooo69 Watch the video clearly the driver swing little bit to left side
[2022-12-08 01:35:23] <+VanGoalen> At the end of the day. If you guys have a drivers license, if the car didnt slide infront of them they wouldve probably just kept driving.
[2022-12-08 01:35:35] <ratiooooo69> @thamer6464 yh cause he slammed his brakes to shit, that makes the car swerve
[2022-12-08 01:35:39] <%+RJBascombe7> guys how about we stop making assumptions and just wish our best for everyone involved.
[2022-12-08 01:35:42] <+VanGoalen> If it wasn't their fault ofcourse*
[2022-12-08 01:35:42] <declan_1577> @thamer6464 the car that crashed was on the left side

[2022-12-08 01:36:11] <+rickoomak> bro did you guys see the Castro clip
[2022-12-08 01:36:14] <+rkumar119> Anyway I hope everyone is fine and I think we should stop speaking about it
[2022-12-08 01:36:16] <signingpoem9620> His driver was swinging AFTER the car already lost control…
[2022-12-08 01:36:18] <tk4u> i think abdul tried to scare the driver as a joke or maybe he did it by accident idk
[2022-12-08 01:36:18] <kingkurdo00> thats crazy tho

[2022-12-08 01:36:34] <UrMumisCalledSteve> you can hear castro saying “go, go, go” in the end of the video to drive off
[2022-12-08 01:36:36] <%+rishray> tbf my drivers license takes control of my car when i don’t know what to do

[2022-12-08 01:36:48] <thamer6464> @declan_1577 You know when someone to slide towards you try to avoid him by going to other side it’s as clear the fault on the driver
[2022-12-08 01:36:59] <tk4u> @UrMumisCalledSteve no bro come on stop saying lies now
[2022-12-08 01:37:02] <fa1lertv> @UrMumisCalledSteve hahaha he said it to check that car man

[2022-12-08 01:47:19] <ratiooooo69> Who tf cares what he said man he was obviously in distress. Even if he said something crazy it's an impulsive reaction
[2022-12-08 01:47:19] <+j_mc5709> Castro said go go go at the end but it’s obviously to go see if the people are ok ffs LUL
[2022-12-08 01:47:27] <+healtheekid> It look like he saw it coming and simply tried to avoid it
[2022-12-08 01:47:32] <xRamiresx> @j_mc5709 what happened?
[2022-12-08 01:47:32] <tal_98> what happend with castro??
[2022-12-08 01:47:40] <+Shervin6673> its just jealousy towards the driver now people cant seem to see he is happy and having fun

[2022-12-08 01:49:18] <kylebrof23> Castro's driver swerved into there lane causing them to crash its blatent

[2022-12-08 01:57:06] <mazinthegr8> nep my girl left me because she said all i care about is 'soccer'..

[2022-12-08 02:26:27] <zTiiGER7> England could use Mourinho's Soldier Tactic to stop mbappe, I wonder who will mark him........
[2022-12-08 02:26:35] <+elliotpatterson> However I am aware of the fact that it being 2 years ago it will be hard to find what I said and all I can remember is it being cocky and arrogant so understably it will be fine if not man

[2022-12-08 02:27:25] <%Post_FUT_Clarity> @King_rfz14 yeah mate, the most important thing, material stuff is irrelevant as long as human life is not at danger
[2022-12-08 02:27:25] <+NFFC_Lovey> Hopefully Walker doesn’t get booked to early

[2022-12-08 02:28:39] <%Post_FUT_Clarity> this could be Trent's redemption game, if he channels his inner Javier Zanetti defense masterclass
[2022-12-08 02:28:50] <+LengthyBloke> If England sit back and counter we will win imo
[2022-12-08 02:28:53] <+elliotpatterson> In case you can check the twitter handle is @ElliotPatters12
[2022-12-08 02:29:17] <%+brandonmcandrew78> Jude will run the midfield
[2022-12-08 02:29:18] <%+rishray> we’ll sit back and won’t counter
[2022-12-08 02:29:32] <%$deathskamikaze> i hope he doesnt start 5 back
[2022-12-08 02:29:42] <%Post_FUT_Clarity> they have fast CBs and hard working midfield, hardly a counter goes thru
[2022-12-08 02:29:52] <tomfozzy> just jumped in a game and got confused, Nunez has hair
[2022-12-08 02:29:54] <th3_m435tro> stay compact and attack in numbers
[2022-12-08 02:29:56] <%+barnaby17> I reckon we should play 4231 1 depth drop back
[2022-12-08 02:30:04] <AHumanAlien> I just hope they stick with 4-3-3
[2022-12-08 02:30:09] <%+rishray> theo rabiot and mbappe will outrun the whole team
[2022-12-08 02:30:19] <+klopptinho> i don't think we have the pace  to play counter against konate and upa
[2022-12-08 02:30:22] <deeeg13> dw everyone its ok we got saka all is good :)
[2022-12-08 02:30:29] <abbas222> funny story nep I struggled to fet 39 token Iwas one token from Vieira then I thought I would get better luck if I do the Icon pick you know what I got out of that Gk Casillas  I got mad 😠 I've deleted the game and I come back this evening  I f****ing love this fifa
[2022-12-08 02:30:30] <+Padee> @NepentheZ Southgate will get found out pretty quickly if they don't play defensive
[2022-12-08 02:30:30] <Aerondonn> playing defensive lost us the euros lol
[2022-12-08 02:30:38] <+King_rfz14> Do you think Southgate will go 5 back?
[2022-12-08 02:30:41] <ldog028> saka hattrick
[2022-12-08 02:30:45] <scmk536> its southgate i feel like he will shit the bed and set up too defensively
[2022-12-08 02:30:48] <%Post_FUT_Clarity> England has good CMs who can control the possession and the game IMO
[2022-12-08 02:30:49] <thejoker394> it's gonna be rigged for mbappe to win the game from a pen
[2022-12-08 02:30:56] <%Creativename_> Southgate is just too pragmatic and conservative though regardless of formation you will probe have like 3 attacking players on the pitch
[2022-12-08 02:31:30] <AHumanAlien> Is that Infantino'
[2022-12-08 02:31:30] <+abdu_seliman> has anyone seen a W from the icon pick?
[2022-12-08 02:31:42] <+NFFC_Lovey> Hopefully Walker doesn’t get booked to early
[2022-12-08 02:31:53] <+mr_whizzz> if you hit the lb dribble in your end for too short it, will send a CB on a run.
[2022-12-08 02:32:03] <+NFFC_Lovey> He’s not fully fit yet I don’t think tho
[2022-12-08 02:32:07] <+thereds32fc> Form surely plays apart, he’s not 100%
[2022-12-08 02:32:12] <+ZaidFreestyle> he wasn't fit
[2022-12-08 02:32:19] <mikegreenyt> ye he was rapid last year
[2022-12-08 02:32:24] <%$oclarkk> or he just isnt fit
[2022-12-08 02:32:28] <%Post_FUT_Clarity> he injured in CL semi final against Real Madrid I think
[2022-12-08 02:32:39] <%+barnaby17> worst part is even if France win thuram will still be 3* 4* 80 balance lmao
[2022-12-08 02:32:39] <khaledrashad98> are u playing on ps4 now
[2022-12-08 02:32:43] <%+callumboscoe> Stinks of a back five doesn’t it. Double up on him
[2022-12-08 02:32:45] <+ZaidFreestyle> but he did lose a bit of pace i agree
[2022-12-08 02:32:46] <cfc_Ray19> he obviously wasn't fully fit, hopefully he's a bit better by the weekend
[2022-12-08 02:32:50] <scmk536> he’s starting to get on a bit now as well not as easy to recover from injuries
[2022-12-08 02:33:07] <thejoker394> I feel like ronaldo doesn't run much in games to lengthen his career.
[2022-12-08 02:33:09] <Aerondonn> gotta be careful of Dembele on Shaw and Griezmann has been very good so far.
[2022-12-08 02:33:13] <%Post_FUT_Clarity> foul m

[2022-12-08 15:05:08] <SaneCaeser> Same as how Out of position promo was just Shapeshifters from last year every promo is just the same with a different name.
[2022-12-08 15:05:10] <abbas222> funny story nep I struggled to get 39 token Iwas one token  away from Vieira then I thought I would get better luck if I do the Icon pick you know what I got out of that Gk Casillas  I got mad 😠 I've deleted the game and I come back this evening  I f****ing love this fifa
[2022-12-08 15:05:20] <%therealcathal> Sterling back with England squad
[2022-12-08 15:05:21] <+TMaier10> If they purposely left out Musiala to wait until future stars that’s disappointing. I want a usable version of him now
[2022-12-08 15:05:25] <%+kingnovakin> @SaneCaeser heard you the first time
[2022-12-08 15:05:33] <Tavi1648> what was the green one from last year on Kounde?
[2022-12-08 15:05:36] <ifbbsami> No Musiala?😑😑😑
[2022-12-08 15:05:40] <+V10Vernon> he had one
[2022-12-08 15:05:48] <GlasgowFIFA> @nepenthez Gnabry POTM just went active
[2022-12-08 15:05:49] <+hutsmuts_> fifa 19
[2022-12-08 15:06:08] <dopenhagen_dk> Past Future Stars promo
[2022-12-08 15:06:30] <+m3y3r24> but what are predictions for future stars this year?
[2022-12-08 15:06:33] <TonyVWPT> same cards over and over again. "Phenom" for players that dont even start for their teams or were bang average in the tournament, instead of focusing on the actual breakout stars
[2022-12-08 15:06:42] <+plebalertx> copy and paste content
[2022-12-08 15:06:45] <mohammadhwiedi> Frimpong was an sbc &now he is sbc!!
[2022-12-08 15:06:48] <johnfive21> Musiala has to have one
[2022-12-08 15:06:52] <+alex_jacobs96> I mean its fine... as long as they still do future stars, but I have a feeling they won't
[2022-12-08 15:06:55] <+notorious_noob86> laaazy from EA tobh
[2022-12-08 15:07:07] <Olli987> lazy batches

[2022-12-08 15:07:12] <uhavebeengoofed> they are lazy as shit recycle it all ! I will stop giving them any money
[2022-12-08 15:07:16] <here4rewards_> Ridiculous
[2022-12-08 15:07:17] <jafar_abdeen> Why not use gakpo
[2022-12-08 15:07:18] <%jordan97jw> i dont mind it to be honest
[2022-12-08 15:07:20] <+m3y3r24> they could easily use players like Gavi and Musiala wth?
[2022-12-08 15:07:22] <%+kane25> re brand as always!
[2022-12-08 15:07:25] <ahmad23zdt> I don't mind it tbh
[2022-12-08 15:07:25] <bourney84> negative nep🤣🤣🤣
[2022-12-08 15:07:29] <RC95_FIFA> maybe future stars will still come?
[2022-12-08 15:07:35] <%josh_rawlins21057> Lautaro is 25 why is he in this year
[2022-12-08 15:07:35] <johnfive21> I swear EA doesn't watch or know anything about football
[2022-12-08 15:07:37] <+TMaier10> EA allergic to giving Musiala special cards
[2022-12-08 15:07:40] <jhunter123> I imagine that they will do future stars later in the year
[2022-12-08 15:07:40] <%ryanb2717> young talents that nobody will spend to try obtain them
[2022-12-08 15:07:41] <DaarkHuunter> theyre saving the new ones for actual future stars
[2022-12-08 15:07:42] <%+kingnovakin> @bourney84 ea make it too easy lmao
[2022-12-08 15:07:48] <%+oliver21k> This is established young players, future stars is about those just breaking out
[2022-12-08 15:08:03] <+SchmeatX> change to wc cards in version make youngest pop up first
[2022-12-08 15:08:06] <KEYSIAH> try career mode search

[2022-12-08 15:08:21] <TonyVWPT> Soufiane Amrabaat, Enzo Fernandez
[2022-12-08 15:08:26] <%$oclarkk> @oliver21k future stars stopped being breakout players after the first year
[2022-12-08 15:08:26] <%Jaay_Tekz> click on far right you can order it there

[2022-12-08 15:08:32] <papa_osos> Age is on the far right lad
[2022-12-08 15:08:33] <jhunter123> This isn’t future stars these are already stars future stars will come later in the cycle imo
[2022-12-08 15:08:37] <Tavi1648> Top right on futbin you have age @nepenthez
[2022-12-08 15:08:46] <TonyVWPT> but no! just another PL pleasing
[2022-12-08 15:08:48] <papa_osos> Nep age is on the far right of the page mate
[2022-12-08 15:08:49] <+GeorgeH7_> Lichaaa

[2022-12-08 15:09:11] <%+taylorallen133> waiting for 'Trent AA has been listed to come via WC Phenoms SBC'
[2022-12-08 15:09:12] <alexhirad> Gnabry POTM is now available
[2022-12-08 15:09:14] <@%Viperlization> fixed the zoom thing

[2022-12-08 15:09:27] <%$oclarkk> just boring same players
[2022-12-08 15:09:34] <mohammadhwiedi> Frimpong was an sbc &now he is sbc!! Ctrl+c Ctrl+v
[2022-12-08 15:09:38] <+silvaszn> I assume they’re saving the ones without future stars cards already for the actual future stars promo
[2022-12-08 15:09:46] <here4rewards_> surprised they didn't throw Antony in there
[2022-12-08 15:09:47] <jhunter123> I think future stars will be in the future
[2022-12-08 15:09:53] <+forthterms> future starts light
[2022-12-08 15:09:58] <jhunter123> With different players
[2022-12-08 15:09:59] <DaarkHuunter> future stars usually comes late january or february, cant be as good now
[2022-12-08 15:10:01] <+ajaayy> You think they are trying to tapper off the power curve with the lower ratings this new promo?
[2022-12-08 15:10:03] <raseen_fut> is this for clips??
[2022-12-08 15:10:07] <%therealcathal> Gnabry POTM is out and decent value
[2022-12-08 15:10:08] <sepittaja666> well that's because future stars would be 3 months from now
[2022-12-08 15:10:10] <%+kingnovakin> neppo been promoted
[2022-12-08 15:10:11] <@%Viperlization> Now know how to do it for everything which is nice
[2022-12-08 15:10:13] <bxt606> would be better if this was the theme of the promo. these former future stars now shining at the world cup
[2022-12-08 15:10:14] <sepittaja666> but i do get your point
[2022-12-08 15:10:14] <%ryanb2717> all established players nep this is not future stars
[2022-12-08 15:10:19] <%KKAAMMUU> frimpong is a sbc again i think
[2022-12-08 15:10:20] <%djz19_> has mbappe ever had a future stars?
[2022-12-08 15:10:22] <+robertps59> Their future stars is the highest potential whereas this is their impact on the World Cup
[2022-12-08 15:10:26] <stackmillz> but camivinga hasnt even done shit in the world cup but they still give him a card its rediculous
[2022-12-08 15:10:27] <kieranmartin75> Is it not predicted stats and ratings
[2022-12-08 15:10:30] <@%Viperlization> clip?
[2022-12-08 15:10:43] <+alex_jacobs96> You'd like to hope they won't pull future stars in January just because of this promo
[2022-12-08 15:10:49] <FL3TCH3R__> Baddest of them all
[2022-12-08 15:10:52] <%ItsTr3ple> Matteoooo is coming <3
[2022-12-08 15:10:52] <ahmad23zdt> kounde/ lisandro Martinez/ lautaro Martinez/ and probably Rodrygo never had a future stars I think
[2022-12-08 15:10:53] <@%Viperlization> What do want me to do with it?
[2022-12-08 15:10:56] <@%Viperlization> Main channel vid?

[2022-12-08 15:11:10] <Tavi1648> Mbape was born directly  a star
[2022-12-08 15:11:10] <%$oclarkk> nah they got the rating for the showdowns wrong
[2022-12-08 15:11:18] <%+jaythemillerman> did you get Vieira last night neppo. came off around 12.30
[2022-12-08 15:11:25] <@%Witchwalker70> Speaking of young players, I picked up Gaspar Campos limited and rare earlier this week. He's scored a screamer for Burgos this aft

[2022-12-08 15:11:47] <GlasgowFIFA> @nepenthez Gnabry potm is out
[2022-12-08 15:11:48] <jamsekmiha> maybe thats the point of giving ex future stars promo cards that lived up to the potential and we get the other players in the future stars promo

[2022-12-08 15:12:12] <+kingcrime2003> The problem with them giving cards to different players is they never upgrade them to be good enough but when it comes to militao/kounde they are already good so they will just be better

[2022-12-08 15:14:06] <+J_Anderson3> did Gnabry to clear dupes, cant wait to use him
[2022-12-08 15:14:10] <@%Viperlization> Bundes POTM out btw

[2022-12-08 15:14:17] <%czechmate92576> Cheer100 fifa 23 feels like it was made just to fill the contractual obligations, i.e a greatest hits album
[2022-12-08 15:14:19] <88_DEADPOOL_88> as in can I invest in players that are about to go out of packs on friday for a promo?
[2022-12-08 15:14:21] <%+robertovidal46> Gnabry is at least cheaper than other 87 on the market, so might be good as fodder :D
[2022-12-08 15:14:24] <%Brandez84> getting excited for the sorare news.....
[2022-12-08 15:14:37] <+jjn1lfc_> I like toast
[2022-12-08 15:14:38] <here4rewards_> presume you saw the Lib and Sub price range fixes, hope that bodes well for League SBCs soon
[2022-12-08 15:14:39] <%ItsTr3ple> Makes me well happy but so confusing LUL
[2022-12-08 15:14:40] <valorouschimp43> should i invest in bruno even though hes already expensive?
[2022-12-08 15:14:40] <%KKAAMMUU> @ItsTr3ple same for frimpong
[2022-12-08 15:14:42] <johnfive21> All these WC promos are not linked to WC at all. It's just a skin
[2022-12-08 15:14:43] <+matawi> hi from saudi
[2022-12-08 15:14:58] <+sknvbj> brown bread toast is goated

[2022-12-08 15:15:03] <%josh_rawlins21057> Gnabry prob worth just for the 87
[2022-12-08 15:15:07] <@%Witchwalker70> No I'm not @Brandez84 LUL Hoping they keep some sort of threshold
[2022-12-08 15:15:10] <papa_osos> Think he got some v tunisia
[2022-12-08 15:15:10] <Jackanory96> Team looked for Global Cup?

[2022-12-08 15:15:15] <deziixixv> they want the game to be realistic and reflect IRL but do cards like these
[2022-12-08 15:15:19] <+oakems> what're we thinking for the sorare announcement today?
[2022-12-08 15:15:22] <shinsou28> he played right wing against Tunisia haha
[2022-12-08 15:15:27] <+ianharris76> he played in the game they lost
[2022-12-08 15:15:27] <marklongworth98> Tunisia where they’d have probably started me if I went
[2022-12-08 15:15:27] <%djz19_> didn’t he play like right wing vs tunisia
[2022-12-08 15:15:28] <callumalc7> he got mins playing on the wing

[2022-12-08 15:15:59] <+diioxal> the guendozi card just confirms its a future star reskin, hes done nothing this tournammet lol
[2022-12-08 15:16:00] <%sorarejosh> lower threshold removed and podium payouts increased to top 10 or smething, id be happy w that
[2022-12-08 15:16:04] <papa_osos> @brent040 Team 2 maybe?
[2022-12-08 15:16:12] <+kingcrime2003> The problem with them giving cards to different players is they never upgrade them to be good enough but when it comes to militao/kounde they are already good so they will just be better
[2022-12-08 15:16:13] <jhunter123> @itstr3ple really I heard some fans were unhappy with his style?
[2022-12-08 15:16:18] <oAJL_> endrick to real here we go
[2022-12-08 15:16:25] <johnfive21> That's a big podium LUL
[2022-12-08 15:16:27] <%ItsTr3ple> @jhunter123 Wedon't care about the style he's making us win tournaments
[2022-12-08 15:16:59] <jhunter123> Apart from the euros after that defeat to was it Switzerland I heard fans wanted him gone @itstr3ple
[2022-12-08 15:17:12] <here4rewards_> Would've loved a Diogo Costa card
[2022-12-08 15:17:12] <@%Viperlization> do you want me to full facecam this intro?
[2022-12-08 15:17:15] <%therealcathal> isnt Lautaro 25?
[2022-12-08 15:17:20] <%ItsTr3ple> @jhunter123 Like any fanbase, there are divergence in opinions, but most of us love him
[2022-12-08 15:17:23] <@%Viperlization> yeah yeah
[2022-12-08 15:17:24] <%tja_100> great intro

[2022-12-08 15:17:50] <+diioxal> yea lol
[2022-12-08 15:17:53] <johnfive21> Some of those players have been around for so long .. kinda weird to call them phenoms
[2022-12-08 15:17:54] <%ryanb2717> 1 year diff not a big deal
[2022-12-08 15:17:58] <Dash_counter7> as soon as u started reading my question ads came up LUL , had to go back to check what u said
[2022-12-08 15:17:58] <@%Viperlization> the dream team has returned i want to cry
[2022-12-08 15:18:05] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> The fact that Martinez is 25 is mind blowing to me. I just assumed he was a grizzled 30 year old
[2022-12-08 15:18:12] <%tja_100> Typical lazy EA
[2022-12-08 15:18:12] <+diioxal> predictions for portugal morocco showdown nep

[2022-12-08 15:18:29] <papa_osos> Lisandro martinez is 24 should of been him
[2022-12-08 15:18:36] <jhunter123> Hence it’s phenoms not future stars

[2022-12-08 15:18:48] <+tatertotz95> Alvarez and Enzo Fernandes would be cool instead we get the same players every year
[2022-12-08 15:18:51] <TonyVWPT> @diioxal I don't think we have enough special Portuguese DM's, so we should have one
[2022-12-08 15:18:54] <papa_osos> Oh shit I thought it was only lautaro
[2022-12-08 15:18:55] <Tavi1648> They eill say ITS A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT PROMO and we have different rules

[2022-12-08 15:20:10] <jhunter123> @deziixixv I wouldn’t be surprised if they do a future stars promo later in the year with lower rated players/ different players
[2022-12-08 15:20:10] <%therealcathal> she is a WNBA player who was caught smuggling a weed vape in russia and got arrested, she broke the law and got jailed and everyone was going mad
[2022-12-08 15:20:11] <johnfive21> the WNBA player that got arrested in Russia for having tiny bit of marijuana oil with her

[2022-12-08 15:20:32] <+Aidanrcam> this promo is not like future stars imo. they'll still do that later in year when more younger players doing well like Alvarez and Enzo. just my opinion
[2022-12-08 15:20:33] <+poobell> the guy last night who looked up some tax stuff was pretty close
[2022-12-08 15:20:48] <alexvuk17> fifa is dead i don’t even play rivals anymore i just have no motivation

[2022-12-08 15:28:05] <here4rewards_> 1000 it is
[2022-12-08 15:28:08] <+ElCazando> hola
[2022-12-08 15:28:11] <raseen_fut> Ea companion is easier to make
[2022-12-08 15:28:11] <+Supplecactus> 1000 it is Vipes
[2022-12-08 15:28:19] <@%Viperlization> great idea
[2022-12-08 15:28:21] <+diioxal> volland packs soon
[2022-12-08 15:28:23] <@%Viperlization> should do this monday night tho
[2022-12-08 15:28:24] <%Brandez84> easy to do 4 of those per hour
[2022-12-08 15:28:38] <%$coys51> 1000
[2022-12-08 15:28:39] <jhunter123> 400*
[2022-12-08 15:28:40] <@%Viperlization> too hard
[2022-12-08 15:28:41] <here4rewards_> 500 seems a good balance
[2022-12-08 15:28:43] <doron_fifa> ❤️
[2022-12-08 15:28:43] <+oweish> @Brandez84 per hour??
[2022-12-08 15:28:45] <%jordan97jw> i reckon viper gets on the accuont now and just doesnt stop till they leave
[2022-12-08 15:28:50] <stemil19> 250 could be doable
[2022-12-08 15:28:51] <@%Viperlization> now with everything they've put into the game
[2022-12-08 15:28:51] <%Brandez84> 37 per hour for 1000 of them
[2022-12-08 15:28:54] <+Supplecactus> Personally Nep I think 1000 would be brilliant. I think Vipes can do it
[2022-12-08 15:28:59] <@%Viperlization> 500 - 1000 is gonna mean a payrise im sorry
[2022-12-08 15:29:00] <+j_mc5709> Probably market banned after 200
[2022-12-08 15:29:00] <%+mcburnie100> Afternoon Nep how are doing

[2022-12-08 15:49:11] <justanormallad23> @snowtiger0022 i think as long as you get the reward upgrade youll be fine. You need luck with any division's rewards really. I feel that 4/5 is soo easy compared to 2/3 and the step up in rewards is minimal imo

[2022-12-08 15:53:44] <justanormallad23> @Baktabs because the bad ones are terrible. The picks all have terrible weight but the rate of return for PTG picks would be terrible because a lot of the cards are unusable and unlinkable

[2022-12-08 15:56:17] <TonyVWPT> @MickeysIce So true indeed. More and more Trades are in high demand, and with two/three generations only going for Uni paths, there's such a lack of skilled people in Trades like Electricity, industrial mechanics, etc.
[2022-12-08 15:56:19] <artofsolo72> @johnthegg education prices in US is ridiculous
[2022-12-08 15:56:19] <%theJFKexperience0> What are you eating ? I’m having tomato soup and a calzone
[2022-12-08 15:56:21] <%+kingnovakin> that looks great
[2022-12-08 15:56:22] <%+niblacs> looks banging
[2022-12-08 15:56:27] <%theJFKexperience0> Nvm you answered looks sick
[2022-12-08 15:56:29] <%+Johnnyv421> Nep seeing you speaking for all of us on the current state of fifa is very refreshing tbh
[2022-12-08 15:56:31] <%Brandez84> will have to give you a little follow on the peloton!!
[2022-12-08 15:56:52] <iibreadl> Nep are you going to push your kids to go to school?
[2022-12-08 15:57:04] <MickeysIce> why saddle yourself in 200k debt.. just go to a Trade School and learn a profession
[2022-12-08 15:57:17] <@%Witchwalker70> LUL
[2022-12-08 15:57:23] <artofsolo72> just watched another streamer play 2 matches in a row against a hacker, players on full stam on min. 90 and all players with 99 stats
[2022-12-08 15:57:28] <%+kingnovakin> knew thhat was coming when I saw the Q haha
[2022-12-08 15:57:30] <+snowtiger0022> I think gameplay can be bad. But it always is so who cares. Just give us fun content to grind like league SBCs
[2022-12-08 15:57:30] <+ElCazando> I wouldnt be in the profession I'm in without sixth form and uni
[2022-12-08 15:57:39] <+theaaronb21> leaked content for tonight?
[2022-12-08 15:57:40] <james_spruce> Home schooling with nep
[2022-12-08 15:57:43] <%theJFKexperience0> My mom was poor so I went on to be a heavy machinery mech and I’m so happy that I did that instead of piss away 100k
[2022-12-08 15:57:47] <OGSmallTymer> Endrick to Real Madrid got a Here We Go
[2022-12-08 15:57:50] <MickeysIce> @TonyVWPT agree
[2022-12-08 15:57:54] <%+kingnovakin> he set you up too easy
[2022-12-08 15:57:58] <ggmasy> you doing the England vs France sbc?
[2022-12-08 15:57:58] <icyweatherr> Just finished a law degree and pushed through to get a really good grade, now im in a position where I can have a great career and be setup for the rest of my life. Best decision I ever made getting educated
[2022-12-08 15:58:02] <%+Johnnyv421> We’re probably gonna get marquee matchups and that’s it
[2022-12-08 15:58:07] <%+iamterry1997> Is it worth saving packs for tomorrow promo?
[2022-12-08 15:58:14] <trix2splashy> How long does it approx take to grind Patrick, I know you ain’t got him but the amount you play can you give an estimate?
[2022-12-08 15:58:23] <GrantyTV> Tomorrow’s promo looks insane
[2022-12-08 15:58:44] <iibreadl> Just finished my Mickey Mouse degree
[2022-12-08 15:58:56] <ErenYNWA> I will graduate from English language teaching next year and ı dont know what to do
[2022-12-08 15:58:59] <+ikester213> onlyfans as a backup plan
[2022-12-08 15:59:05] <icyweatherr> Agreed Nep, cheers for the advice!
[2022-12-08 15:59:06] <joshiodo2001> Im in my final year of uni but I absolutely hate it and am at a dead end and don’t know where to go nep, any advice?
[2022-12-08 15:59:06] <TLOTOOLE> Don’t have a plan B or C because it distracts from Plan A
[2022-12-08 15:59:07] <+Shezu85> Preach Nep
[2022-12-08 15:59:08] <+plebalertx> any advice for someone in the pub industry?
[2022-12-08 15:59:12] <%+peterrm8> ive been learning to code with ios apps and ive had my first 2 accepted onto the app store
[2022-12-08 15:59:13] <xIsCKillerx> lmaooo
[2022-12-08 15:59:14] <+obliviaa> how long left on swaps?
[2022-12-08 15:59:17] <hd6skillz> is a degree worth it nowadays?
[2022-12-08 15:59:17] <jameslfc7> Afternoon mate 👍
[2022-12-08 15:59:19] <+anieresus_03> Lmao
[2022-12-08 15:59:20] <@%Viperlization> Yeah I was looking at OnlyFans as B
[2022-12-08 15:59:20] <vendra_2> ngl mickey mouse is great, but thats weird
[2022-12-08 15:59:22] <james_spruce> Yeah if all goes downhill only fans it is
[2022-12-08 15:59:23] <+rokerjoker_> We have a good example of lack of education in chat
[2022-12-08 15:59:29] <@%Viperlization> Then really scrape the barrel if we get to C
[2022-12-08 15:59:33] <%czechmate92576> im on like plan x already
[2022-12-08 15:59:39] <jpompeo40> I also think there’s different ways to get educated. If school isn’t your thing, then you can learn a trade. Still educated, just in a different way
[2022-12-08 15:59:40] <+ElCazando> Having plans shouldn't distract from an ambition
[2022-12-08 15:59:40] <%+iamterry1997> I’ve got the 300 friendlies wins & I’m not sure wether to save for tomorrows promo or just open them now as this promo isn’t great is it
[2022-12-08 15:59:44] <ibrahim272000> if portugal is gonna win the wc fore ronaldo any they win it porugal is ronaldo then gonna be the goat over messi or nah because he didnt carry portugal this time ?
[2022-12-08 15:59:44] <BarefootWharf901> yeh so ive started college this year and didnt know what i wanted to do so doing a general teaching degree and take it from there and do whatever i want for masters
[2022-12-08 15:59:45] <zongorpista> i have 4 jobs currently, because all plans did kinda succeed :D
[2022-12-08 15:59:46] <%theJFKexperience0> Idk how much school costs overseas but here in the US you better know what you wanna study cause it costs an arm and a leg 😂
[2022-12-08 15:59:47] <jensonking17> i say get a trade whats your ops
[2022-12-08 15:59:47] <trix2splashy> How long does it approx take to grind Patrick, I know you ain’t got him but the amount you play can you give an estimate?
[2022-12-08 15:59:50] <hd6skillz> currently on placement year
[2022-12-08 15:59:53] <%Brandez84> Plan B - Sell photos of my feet, here they are in high order of late
[2022-12-08 15:59:55] <grenadier2> Bread's mom has a Mickey Mouse degree. I would know, I gave it to her.
[2022-12-08 15:59:58] <+sarujan_m> Yeah things never do go to plan, finished a maths and finance degree but now in compliance - a completely different field to what I studied
[2022-12-08 16:00:03] <impactified> why am i raging in silver lounge
[2022-12-08 16:00:09] <icyweatherr> @hd6skillz Depends on the subject, STEM subjects are always what employers will like to see and are in demand atm
[2022-12-08 16:00:12] <johnthegg> @impactified because it's fifa
[2022-12-08 16:00:13] <+ElCazando> Not having backup plans cos it will distract from Plan A sounds like an excuse.
[2022-12-08 16:00:18] <+ikester213> someone out there will buy a picture of my feet
[2022-12-08 16:00:19] <iibreadl> All I’m saying is a got a degree in business and  I didn’t necessarily put it to use yet. I’m also 1st generation.
[2022-12-08 16:00:22] <MickeysIce> Cybersecurity is a good field to get into.
[2022-12-08 16:00:24] <%theJFKexperience0> Plan b is to make 80+ packs for nep
[2022-12-08 16:00:28] <%sorarejosh> think they reduced thresholds now 41 euro instead of 50$
[2022-12-08 16:00:34] <+ajaayy> I went to Uni and don't use any technical skills I learned in current role but I improved my non-technical skills like decision making etc during that time
[2022-12-08 16:00:34] <%+Johnnyv421> I’ll sell my feet for sure but people will pay me to not post them
[2022-12-08 16:00:34] <+christin30> yo guys, does anyone know if hakimi gets a card this friday?
[2022-12-08 16:00:37] <impactified> @johnthegg they will speak of your wisdom generations from now
[2022-12-08 16:00:45] <+cfcjamie2512> whilst education is important, I think it is also worth noting that education can take different routes rather than just "formal" platforms such as structured courses. I was an apprentice and have no qualifications over a levels but still have a good career as a banking senior consultant. Its important to be open to any opportunities to learn and develop
[2022-12-08 16:00:54] <jpompeo40> Why is there some weird lighting under Thiago. I’ve seen that but don’t know what it is
[2022-12-08 16:01:02] <@%Witchwalker70> oooh
[2022-12-08 16:01:04] <%+theoldmanrtg7619> Finished work good afternoon neppo hope all is well
[2022-12-08 16:01:04] <%+kingnovakin> @cfcjamie2512 different strokes for different folks
[2022-12-08 16:01:05] <iibreadl> Yeah I think business is more of who you know.
[2022-12-08 16:01:09] <%$mcburnie100> LUL
[2022-12-08 16:01:22] <+hugoboss0000> you gonna stick on arsenal game pal?
[2022-12-08 16:01:24] <+zackbeatty> Fifa is on screen
[2022-12-08 16:01:24] <impactified> nep whatre you munching on
[2022-12-08 16:01:25] <@%Witchwalker70> medium
[2022-12-08 16:01:26] <%theJFKexperience0> In the US every HS pushes for college 100% they don’t mention the trades that you can learn and make 5x
[2022-12-08 16:01:27] <%+Narstie1101> on your screen
[2022-12-08 16:01:37] <+ikester213> is it the weird sparkles under the CM bit ?
[2022-12-08 16:01:39] <+nippy9> medium. com/sorare
[2022-12-08 16:01:42] <%+SamSurg3> Hey Nep ! wassup man ? do u agree with me that all al ouwairan merchants in swaps are just a bunch of C****?!
[2022-12-08 16:01:43] <%ItsTr3ple> He's not talking about Thiago lads ffs
[2022-12-08 16:01:54] <johnthegg> @theJFKexperience0 well college is a giant industry in the US
[2022-12-08 16:01:57] <%+Johnnyv421> Thiago is a star ⭐️ can’t  wait to see us play again  I almost forgot how shit we are
[2022-12-08 16:01:57] <iibreadl> I do believe having a degree is a got way to pivot into something else.
[2022-12-08 16:02:37] <%Brandez84> love it
[2022-12-08 16:02:41] <OW3NN_> and logical
[2022-12-08 16:02:42] <cornholio516> Godaamit i thought it was a fut announcement no one cares ab sorare
[2022-12-08 16:02:50] <%theJFKexperience0> @johnthegg definitely is.
[2022-12-08 16:02:54] <agdaltarek99> imagine EA making fun decisions
[2022-12-08 16:03:01] <Baggx> xtoniWait
[2022-12-08 16:03:07] <%Brandez84> sorare > fifa

[2022-12-08 16:03:55] <%Brandez84> so far so good
[2022-12-08 16:04:01] <%ItsTr3ple> @cornholio516 Don't be that guy

[2022-12-08 16:05:15] <%jordan97jw> gonna make super rares much easier to sell i imagine now

[2022-12-08 16:05:17] <%Brandez84> over a K per month

[2022-12-08 16:05:32] <@%Witchwalker70> I'm happy and relieved
[2022-12-08 16:05:36] <%bazza3166> this is fantastic
[2022-12-08 16:05:45] <%sorarejosh> thats fantastic for super rare junk hoarders like urself haha
[2022-12-08 16:05:46] <Baggx> activTired
[2022-12-08 16:05:46] <%+athwalas> Considering people though they were going to get rid of threshold, this is brilliant news
[2022-12-08 16:06:06] <%+kingnovakin> @theoldmanrtg7619 PS5 mate
[2022-12-08 16:06:53] <%sorarejosh> this is what we wanted more cash rwds , not just buy cards to win cards
[2022-12-08 16:07:27] <+GeorgeCuz> specialist + underdog being removed is a big L, but the threshold mode is class
[2022-12-08 16:08:09] <+GeorgeCuz> yeah true
[2022-12-08 16:08:30] <kzze_> WWW
[2022-12-08 16:08:31] <+GeorgeCuz> ok yeah that's sound then
[2022-12-08 16:08:32] <%Brandez84> brillaint stuff this throughout!!
[2022-12-08 16:08:33] <%+athwalas> The cap works well in NBA
[2022-12-08 16:08:35] <%sorarejosh> specalist was almost impossible to win rares anyways
[2022-12-08 16:09:34] <%ItsTr3ple> That could be a shot at EA that last part KEKW
[2022-12-08 16:09:43] <robo_cfc> overall very nice
[2022-12-08 16:09:51] <robo_cfc> like that we have time to adapt to it too
[2022-12-08 16:09:54] <%+Andyc1993> big W from sorare
[2022-12-08 16:09:54] <%sorarejosh> yeah better than what i expected
[2022-12-08 16:10:17] <+Pawel30cm> i wish EA would communicate with us like this
[2022-12-08 16:10:18] <%+iamterry1997> Way better of an update than ea gives out😂
[2022-12-08 16:10:34] <%sorarejosh> and no rare's in super rare divison is logical too
[2022-12-08 16:10:35] <+hazzah1407> What is this sorry just got here
[2022-12-08 16:10:36] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> Thank god I’ve got that debuchy spread21Smart spread21Smart spread21Smart
[2022-12-08 16:10:38] <%+Andyc1993> I reckon gk prices will rise in price again
[2022-12-08 16:10:43] <+habibdrg03> Are the thresholds in All Star Limited or in an extra Game mode? @chat
[2022-12-08 16:10:44] <$haynesy96> This is such a big W
[2022-12-08 16:10:51] <$haynesy96> Couldve have asked for much more tbh
[2022-12-08 16:10:59] <robo_cfc> thresholds in limited will be interesting
[2022-12-08 16:11:04] <$haynesy96> Would expect prices to rise after this
[2022-12-08 16:11:05] <kzze_> even the limited threshold is good for new users and people who are looking to increase their gallery
[2022-12-08 16:11:20] <%Brandez84> Massive W from me that!!
[2022-12-08 16:11:20] <kristianmufc1993> Hey how’s everyone
[2022-12-08 16:11:20] <+oakems> i love it
[2022-12-08 16:11:20] <@%Witchwalker70> It's great, I'm excited
[2022-12-08 16:11:22] <%+athwalas> 250 points is achievable
[2022-12-08 16:11:25] <%+Andyc1993> just need them to announce the premier league now
[2022-12-08 16:11:26] <%+athwalas> W
[2022-12-08 16:11:27] <marklongworth98> Was away what’s happening ?
[2022-12-08 16:11:27] <%+Pokes21228> i'm brand new so I have no idea lol but it sounds good
[2022-12-08 16:11:28] <+DealbreakerJ> what is this about
[2022-12-08 16:11:30] <+aidyp22> Big W if the capped mode has card rewards too
[2022-12-08 16:11:33] <OW3NN_> Love it, seeing progression system from limited all the way up is a great addition imo
[2022-12-08 16:11:36] <%+ryanplays04> was there anything for the fre to play guys
[2022-12-08 16:11:36] <%sorarejosh> its great, now reason to go and buy a super rare team for me potentialy
[2022-12-08 16:11:38] <+ashtonhall99> It’s exciting
[2022-12-08 16:11:42] <+jennachad> why can't ea do shit like sorare seem
[2022-12-08 16:11:45] <%+iamterry1997> I don’t get how to work sorare tbh so it might make it a lot more helpful for me
[2022-12-08 16:11:50] <agdaltarek99> i only free to play, i dont know if this affects me lool
[2022-12-08 16:11:53] <@%Witchwalker70> Might raise the rare gk prices
[2022-12-08 16:11:54] <jake123playz> bruno g has crashedover 100k oh no
[2022-12-08 16:11:57] <+ashtonhall99> Does this positively impact new comers and lower budget players though
[2022-12-08 16:12:07] <%+Pokes21228> How so?
[2022-12-08 16:12:11] <%Brandez84> NBA you capped at like 120 but need 250 points approx for that lim reward
[2022-12-08 16:12:17] <xdhefty> still just grinding away with my commons lol
[2022-12-08 16:12:25] <%montywastakentwice> afternoon nep
[2022-12-08 16:12:26] <Jackanory96> Do you still need a limited GK? Or can you run 4 limiteds with uncommon GK?
[2022-12-08 16:12:28] <+ashtonhall99> Common grind continues
[2022-12-08 16:12:31] <%+futbolistic97> Don't fully understand all, just started sorare recently
[2022-12-08 16:12:41] <jesushosseinch> I’m a big football fan but I don’t know how sorare works. Is it like FPL that u pick players and get points?
[2022-12-08 16:12:45] <%+athwalas> Makes players with low L15 who have a good fixture more valuable, so will help the market
[2022-12-08 16:12:49] <+danboyle156> Is this game worth starting?
[2022-12-08 16:12:57] <%+iamterry1997> Big dub for me then, I’ll be able to start doing well hopefully as I don’t spend much & wanna get better at it
[2022-12-08 16:12:59] <xhaka0411> Wurt
[2022-12-08 16:13:09] <%Brandez84> albeit with the MVP
[2022-12-08 16:13:24] <Jackanory96> Can you still use common GK? In Limited competition
[2022-12-08 16:13:26] <%sorarejosh> that 250$ each week with uniques are very lucrative, now reason to progress for the likes of urself
[2022-12-08 16:13:42] <xdhefty> then re invest, the grind never stops
[2022-12-08 16:13:47] <NiceToMichu09> I’m hoping to win a limited from the global cup and use my new commons to win one in academy advanced and see what I can do from there, currently on for a tier 2 overall reward and won some collection cards I’ve sold on so I’m excited
[2022-12-08 16:13:50] <%$coys51> What would be a good low budget to start with nep?
[2022-12-08 16:13:50] <+danboyle156> When you say low budget what do you actually mean by that?

[2022-12-08 16:14:06] <%+ryanplays04> literally is like an rtg for the free to play guys essentially
[2022-12-08 16:14:07] <%Pryzel> update is a massive win for the majority of people
[2022-12-08 16:14:15] <schneiderman__> hey nep hope you're good
[2022-12-08 16:14:28] <%+iamterry1997> When you say low budget what sort of price are we talking nep?
[2022-12-08 16:14:46] <OGSmallTymer> I wish they add u-23 for common with common star reward for top 5-10%
[2022-12-08 16:14:55] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> Playing matchups is going to be so important now
[2022-12-08 16:14:57] <%+Narstie1101> have u watched that ancient apocalypse thing on Netflix?
[2022-12-08 16:15:02] <+Greeny1832> common u23 would be cool
[2022-12-08 16:15:17] <%sorarejosh> there are playing limited gk's £15 atm
[2022-12-08 16:15:22] <OW3NN_> I would say even less with current prices
[2022-12-08 16:15:26] <%+iamterry1997> Big dub then if that’s the case
[2022-12-08 16:15:26] <robo_cfc> limited keepers may start going up now
[2022-12-08 16:15:31] <@%Witchwalker70> The only thing is I've only got 2 super rares that I was going to play rare pro so I presume that will ge going?
[2022-12-08 16:15:49] <joshuaseps> Super Rare Keepers to the moon tho
[2022-12-08 16:16:01] <+Greeny1832> 240 with an MVP like NBA?
[2022-12-08 16:16:05] <kzze_> @robo_cfc they already are going up viviano went from 15 pounds to 22 in minutes
[2022-12-08 16:16:06] <joshuaseps> sad about underdog and specialist going but still a good update overall
[2022-12-08 16:16:06] <+keenpow> what is this?
[2022-12-08 16:16:14] <imPib> Good news tbh
[2022-12-08 16:16:14] <%Pryzel> gonna pick up some limited goalkeepers before they go crazy I think
[2022-12-08 16:16:17] <xdhefty> the less money you put in initially, you have to put the time into what players you want specifically for what matchups are going on and form is a massive thing to keep an eye on imo
[2022-12-08 16:16:19] <ninad1997> What’s up nep
[2022-12-08 16:16:27] <robo_cfc> @kzze_ jesus, yeah i seem them all slowly start to rise over the next 6 months
[2022-12-08 16:16:46] <%+athwalas> Makes having a soraredata subscription esstential
[2022-12-08 16:16:47] <+aidyp22> 240 points is very similar to the specialist requirements anyway, 2 40s 2 50s and a 60
[2022-12-08 16:16:56] <%Brandez84> £1 Lims just become kind of valuable
[2022-12-08 16:17:05] <%+athwalas> Going to be spending hours scouting
[2022-12-08 16:17:06] <%wayne2tatos> I believe this is a big W that amount off times in underdog your player goes over the L15 cap and you have to replace them now you can keep them in and swap another player in with a lower L15
[2022-12-08 16:17:13] <+danboyle156> How easy is it to get going in this game with no money spent?
[2022-12-08 16:17:19] <Jackanory96> Idrissi
[2022-12-08 16:17:22] <%oMODS> Hi @NepentheZ . should we save the 84 x 20 (3x) for tomorrow or TOTY?
[2022-12-08 16:17:23] <+danboyle156> And what’s the idea of the game?
[2022-12-08 16:17:25] <%+theoldmanrtg7619> So you would go for attacking def like a fullback
[2022-12-08 16:17:44] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> Habib Diallo is a perfect example
[2022-12-08 16:17:47] <%+theoldmanrtg7619> To get your goals and clean sheet ??
[2022-12-08 16:17:57] <callumalc7> what does the the bronze and silver mean on custom series cards/
[2022-12-08 16:18:01] <%sorarejosh> currently stocked up on 50 +  low scoring limited gk's  was meant for the return of specalist but this is just as good for me
[2022-12-08 16:18:33] <ninad1997> Btw nep arsenal vs Lyon going on
[2022-12-08 16:18:40] <+tvanvield> Cafu out of icon pack first w
[2022-12-08 16:18:47] <%ItsTr3ple> Selling me woooow Kappa
[2022-12-08 16:18:56] <+TimBarrettNL> is Noppert in it? did his value got up since the world cup
[2022-12-08 16:19:26] <%$oclarkk> world cup been great for free to play
[2022-12-08 16:19:35] <%+theoldmanrtg7619> Spanish ref league and couple German regional teams are prob route I’d go
[2022-12-08 16:19:54] <$haynesy96> Was very nervous before today but they smashed it
[2022-12-08 16:19:55] <%Brandez84> @sorarejosh i've picked up about half a dozen during this winter break for same reason n once the leagues return. Great News!
[2022-12-08 16:19:59] <%sorarejosh> what i will say its gonna be alot harder to hit 250 with no xp & no captain, defo wont be as consistent ROI imo
[2022-12-08 16:20:13] <james_spruce> What is the actual purpose of gnabry lol

[2022-12-08 16:27:23] <+Reklo27> @NepentheZ think these world swaps take too much time? Spend all this effort on making a team and have to spend time using other players?
[2022-12-08 16:27:23] <%Pryzel> Such good value in MLS limiteds to be had now
[2022-12-08 16:27:25] <a920123_> Not spend a penny on Sorare and got me a team of around €60, never watched as many games of fooyball as the last couple of months

[2022-12-08 16:28:32] <robo_cfc> @Pokes21228 it helps increase your players XP by training them, and XP can often push you higher in the ranks so u basically get better rewards, so make sure to train any spare players u have each gameweek
[2022-12-08 16:28:35] <nc_99> Nep what can i do with my Benzema National Series? Is it just a "special" common card?

[2022-12-08 16:30:37] <%ItsTr3ple> It also helps new users, which is amazing

[2022-12-08 16:30:39] <%sorarejosh> we're gonna see sr gk's become 2x/2.5x now instead of 1.25x/1.5x of the rare ones
[2022-12-08 16:31:09] <%+Pokes21228> @robo_cfc I started watching a bunch of videos LUL Its been super helpful. For training, do they need to be playing games i.e. someone like Courtouis rn

[2022-12-08 16:31:39] <robo_cfc> @Pokes21228 no you can train a player at any point, even if they dont have a game make sure to train them all year round, theyll still gain XP
[2022-12-08 16:31:47] <+R3yn0ld5> What are the custom series ?
[2022-12-08 16:32:01] <+R3yn0ld5> Are they rares
[2022-12-08 16:32:01] <%+Pokes21228> @robo_cfc excellent, really appreciate the help :)

[2022-12-08 16:33:14] <%BobbyTambling> paul scholes to be 88 pace 90 defending icon? would be ideal lol ahaha

[2022-12-08 16:37:01] <%+Pokes21228> most exciting thing for me being new to Sorare is the opportunity to learn about leagues I would never care about before. I love footy so the idea of digging into the K League is exciting to me LUL
[2022-12-08 16:37:49] <+R3yn0ld5> Are the national series worth anything?
[2022-12-08 16:38:10] <$Dafifabomb> took your advices on trying black grapes didnt dissapoint
[2022-12-08 16:38:12] <%Brandez84> @Pokes21228 this is what makes sorare for me, i've watched french, turkish, mls, belgium, dutch league due to sorare that never would of watched previously

[2022-12-08 16:42:11] <jxdams1> Honestly I get so much more satisfaction out of career mode these days
[2022-12-08 16:42:50] <%+mx_fps> just looked at sorare, looks good but dont understand the nft concept
[2022-12-08 16:42:53] <+mattey456> I made a second account to play as an RTG, packed mid Gullit it’s now my main account 😂

[2022-12-08 16:43:16] <lordxxchiefer> Sup nepo
[2022-12-08 16:43:16] <Jackanory96> I don't understand why people seem to think EA would purposefully divebomb Fifa23 with the split next year?
[2022-12-08 16:43:32] <deziixixv> We need a custom chemstyle 20k a pop
[2022-12-08 16:44:02] <$Dafifabomb> played sorare for free for 8 months and picked up some quaity cards
[2022-12-08 16:44:08] <+R3yn0ld5> All the national series worth anything?
[2022-12-08 16:44:43] <%$oclarkk> i just play free to play and like it
[2022-12-08 16:44:49] <imti03> how's your f2p account doing?
[2022-12-08 16:44:53] <+resilientbrazilian31> Sup Nep
[2022-12-08 16:45:31] <adeel488> Nep do u think players like musiala should be in this new promo or should he be in the next future stars promo instead as he will most likely get a better card?
[2022-12-08 16:46:03] <OW3NN_> I would like to see more divisions in common, would get people into the mindset to play the other divisions in limited etc
[2022-12-08 16:46:11] <$Dafifabomb> free to play is brilliant tbf your not loosing but gaining excitment of watching out for a player you chose
[2022-12-08 16:47:05] <69tw> takes a lot of time to get a under 23 team in common LUL
[2022-12-08 16:47:05] <%Brandez84> agree on the common's, they already have 3-comps for that in NBA!
[2022-12-08 16:47:07] <%+rishray> rather spend on sorare than on fifa points
[2022-12-08 16:47:14] <+Diegz17> spend $100 on FIFA points or so rare?
[2022-12-08 16:47:19] <Jackanory96> I have 100+ common cards and can only use 5 of them a game week. We need U23 common etc.
[2022-12-08 16:47:24] <OW3NN_> 100%
[2022-12-08 16:47:31] <+gunnerfc2022> isorare
[2022-12-08 16:47:33] <$Dafifabomb> is nba sorare free?
[2022-12-08 16:47:44] <EminentScalar> they have NBA and MLB I wonder if they'll get NFL
[2022-12-08 16:47:52] <69tw> Anderson is pretty good
[2022-12-08 16:47:54] <%Brandez84> helps to learn the mechanics of sorare
[2022-12-08 16:48:11] <adeel488> Nep do u think players like musiala should be in this new promo or should he be in the next future stars promo instead as he will most likely get a better card? So for example he would get a 88 special card in this ‘phenom’ promo but also would receive a 92 special card in the future stars promo
[2022-12-08 16:48:28] <+Pawel30cm> Arsenal 1:0
[2022-12-08 16:48:32] <%+niblacs> Do you have like a Sorare Tutorial somewhere neppo?
[2022-12-08 16:49:02] <$Dafifabomb> so could you win a gold nba player then go and spend it on football?

[2022-12-08 16:49:26] <%Brandez84> thats banging
[2022-12-08 16:49:28] <Cordy16> Sengun is a quality pick up
[2022-12-08 16:49:34] <+FlushFactory52> Am I right in thinking we keep our common players from the world cup?  If so have they ruined common as loads will now have the best players?
[2022-12-08 16:49:44] <impactified> ea rubbing salt mixed with raccoon turds into the wounds of PTG gnabry owners lol
[2022-12-08 16:49:47] <Cordy16> He does everything for the Rockets

[2022-12-08 16:51:33] <%BobbyTambling> just lost to the shittiest opponent after going undefeated all day, what a load of shit this game is

[2022-12-08 16:52:24] <airball22> He’s a half decent super sub tbh
[2022-12-08 16:52:31] <+crotzer2010> Only December and most people cba with Fifa. In a sad state of affairs. They'll struggle to keep players for the EA FC game due to how they've shafted people with this years game.
[2022-12-08 16:52:35] <elportuguese> Do you think Arsenal will go for a new striker in Jan?
[2022-12-08 16:52:39] <+jetfire0101> will you be making a few 80+ upgrades for tomorrow promo?

[2022-12-08 18:29:54] <a920123_> Were 2 mins into the game and josh already screamed Xd
[2022-12-08 18:29:56] <@Calzuhgg> said nobody ever
[2022-12-08 18:30:01] <%+chriscfcwooooo> the reason I believe we won't get league sbcs today is because no main league bronzes has gone up in price, surely some discord would have the info leaked already
[2022-12-08 18:30:01] <here4rewards_> now*
[2022-12-08 18:30:05] <neil1989> over 2 weeks left

[2022-12-08 18:30:46] <$MrMcMikey> ill be gutted if there isnt 8 tokenss left , i did the 3x 84x20 packs under the impression that theres 60 from concepts
[2022-12-08 18:31:04] <neil1989> im doing viera and the 3x 84x20 packs
[2022-12-08 18:31:08] <%therealcathal> since when was Dan James at Fulham, im baffed
[2022-12-08 18:31:10] <dannydirtstar> Show is that Hunter Biden Laptop Bussy bruh please
[2022-12-08 18:31:17] <@Calzuhgg> EA should hire a community manager for stuff like this
[2022-12-08 18:31:23] <Baine95> theres already been 2 in the store
[2022-12-08 18:31:41] <stemil19> i have 17 tokens to grind for, if they release some more i will go for them, if not, i wont bother
[2022-12-08 18:31:44] <rpc84> Good evening
[2022-12-08 18:31:45] <@Calzuhgg> It's kinda crazy how there's no pipeline to anyone at EA
[2022-12-08 18:31:56] <%+chriscfcwooooo> ea had a few community managers but then they became absolutely useless after a week
[2022-12-08 18:32:00] <%+mx_fps> im just going to grind for vieira, i find it too much of an unenjoyabke grind otherwise
[2022-12-08 18:32:12] <%therealcathal> im gonna save my 84 x 60 until phenoms are out
[2022-12-08 18:32:13] <mrgoh0104> hello why i cant play pele mid he so suck for me
[2022-12-08 18:32:17] <sm1g3lfi0namili2> I am your fan since fifa 19
[2022-12-08 18:32:20] <km411996> I haven’t done one swap token I don’t wanna get banned
[2022-12-08 18:32:23] <hishamalsadi> yo nep how's it going man? just stopped by to say hi, have a good one all!
[2022-12-08 18:32:26] <%therealcathal> i had kinda earmarked my 84 x 60 for TOTY but need that Saka first owner
[2022-12-08 18:32:32] <@Calzuhgg> @km411996 You won't get banned buddy
[2022-12-08 18:32:37] <Baine95> the funniest thing for me you have all these "game changers" but none of them have any contact with ea and none of them can do anything to "change" the game
[2022-12-08 18:32:39] <jimmmbobb2003> ps4 version?
[2022-12-08 18:32:43] <Baine95> so whats the fcking point then
[2022-12-08 18:32:51] <%$JiiMiiE> Would make more sense if they did a "Swaps Showcase V" objective with 4 more
[2022-12-08 18:32:55] <zongorpista> last lyon penalty hahaha
[2022-12-08 18:33:01] <km411996> @calzuhgg are you sure mate
[2022-12-08 18:33:13] <sm1g3lfi0namili2> but I couldn't buy fifa since 2020 because of money. watching you gives me the hype to play again
[2022-12-08 18:33:16] <stemil19> @JiiMiiE if they did i would use 20 tokens for ptg player pick, if not i cant bother for 17 tokens tbh
[2022-12-08 18:33:28] <TheBookie646> Does the 84+x20 go to the store or open immediately?
[2022-12-08 18:33:31] <zongorpista> Arsenal won the shootout 2-1 after the last penalty taker tried to Panenka and failed hilariously
[2022-12-08 18:33:33] <@Calzuhgg> @km411996 Just play like 15 then take a break, A soft ban isn't a real ban, I only ever got one for an 1 hour max
[2022-12-08 18:33:37] <stemil19> they go to store @TheBookie646
[2022-12-08 18:33:49] <TheBookie646> @stemil19 thanks!
[2022-12-08 18:33:56] <stemil19> no probs m8
[2022-12-08 18:34:06] <@Calzuhgg> Vieira feels unreal btw, As he should
[2022-12-08 18:34:13] <%$Evolutiionz8> Can not get on with this game today, passes feel so sloppy and my players are stuck in the mud
[2022-12-08 18:34:20] <km411996> @calzuhgg okay thank you for letting me know I thought you just get banned
[2022-12-08 18:34:24] <%$JiiMiiE> @stemil19 I already did the 84x3 and 82x20, because I didn't want to grind for Vieira but sorta regret
[2022-12-08 18:34:29] <dizzydukc> nep how are you so goated
[2022-12-08 18:34:32] <$MrMcMikey> @JiiMiiE  i thought that then there would have to be 4 in store packs

[2022-12-08 19:07:38] <%$liamfifa91> It’s all been done on purpose to drive people to the store. How else is it possible to get fodder to complete SBC’s? Honestly this is the earliest I’ve stopped playing any Fifa.

[2022-12-08 19:10:02] <BlackRag> Guys are claiming EA is damaging FIFA name LOL, until they sign new contract again.. same thing happened in the 90's and early 200's
[2022-12-08 19:10:06] <+RazorKameo> i feel like the winter world cup timing has fucked up EA's release schedule too

[2022-12-08 19:10:46] <%+katakuri> Nep I don't play this any more but my son (a normie) does and to him there's still TONS of content for him to get through. imo there's a disconnect between ppl who live on the game and casuals, who )regardless of UT money) make up the bill of the userbase
[2022-12-08 19:10:48] <williamruss15> even stopped playing rivals as packs are woeful

[2022-12-08 19:11:42] <ozvaldo1892> if this wasn't there last year with fifa there is know way the content would be this bad
[2022-12-08 19:11:43] <joehaynes17> I don't see how you can have a problem with EA wanting to take coins and money off people and not providing content on the menus then pay £25k for a celebration?
[2022-12-08 19:11:43] <%Dezalleycat> These are very smart tbh

[2022-12-08 19:12:13] <+wrvght_> 25k for a nickname this is quality
[2022-12-08 19:12:13] <BlackRag> EA and FIFA broke apart before in the 90's and 2000's, y'all naive .... FIFA has no game in development, wake up y'all ..
[2022-12-08 19:12:13] <lmurr74> nep distracted from his rant about shit content by the shit content 😂😂

[2022-12-08 19:13:10] <MM02_TTV> @NepentheZ icon pack refresh?
[2022-12-08 19:13:12] <+RazorKameo> @BlackRag you realise the next game from EA is already confirmed seperate from fifa? theres no contract waiting to be signed. deluded if you think that
[2022-12-08 19:13:12] <rimo1999> sabotaging is the right word
[2022-12-08 19:13:13] <tbreezy111> nep do you mind to futbin that POTM usa guy and talk about him?

[2022-12-08 19:13:16] <%$Evolutiionz8> Icon SBC refresh was meant to be today wasnt it?
[2022-12-08 19:13:18] <rached_mindfreak> the world cup being in the winter ruined this game
[2022-12-08 19:13:18] <wiggs4real> Legit nothing to do
[2022-12-08 19:13:20] <Jack_AMP> Fairplay for getting a 10 minute vid out of that content
[2022-12-08 19:13:21] <+c8nnxr> No icon refresh lol

[2022-12-08 19:13:25] <1xnightx1> billion dollar company, shouldn’t cost them much to add good content
[2022-12-08 19:13:26] <rsmith314> The day before a new promo is always terrible for content
[2022-12-08 19:13:27] <%+Pokes21228> might be the 1st time I don't do marquee matchups with those shocking packs
[2022-12-08 19:13:30] <A1exandersson> log in - log out. fuck this game
[2022-12-08 19:13:33] <calsimpsoni> No energy for the ranting, just no words, mental
[2022-12-08 19:13:34] <+yungcubbbb> I was trying to play back the video but forgot this is twitch
[2022-12-08 19:13:34] <stinpickle> Why did icon refresh get delayed another day??
[2022-12-08 19:13:35] <+tgoldie> aaaand off to another game.
[2022-12-08 19:13:37] <%$istreet98> if you're worried about sounding like a broken record why don't you only upload 6pm content when it's worth it?
[2022-12-08 19:13:37] <lmurr74> nep distracted from his rant about shit content by the shit content 😂😂
[2022-12-08 19:13:38] <+TMaier10> its unfortunate, I want to play fifa but theres nothing to do after youve gotten the tokens you want. Same boring grind of 8 rivals wins then champs
[2022-12-08 19:13:39] <$KuncheeYute> The icon pack is not repeatable

[2022-12-08 19:13:45] <1xnightx1> it doesn’t make sense

[2022-12-08 19:13:53] <jacobf1717> all weekwe didn't even get a fut stories sbc WTF
[2022-12-08 19:13:53] <Jack_AMP> You are right tho
[2022-12-08 19:13:55] <@%Viperlization> there is just NOTHING to do
[2022-12-08 19:13:56] <stinpickle> No icon refresh the only thing to look forward to lol
[2022-12-08 19:14:00] <brexitjamie> @kuncheeyute it refreshed today
[2022-12-08 19:14:01] <%$blublud84> Maybe they'll come when WC is done.
[2022-12-08 19:14:01] <%awaydayoffender> morocco cards up in price guys get selling
[2022-12-08 19:14:02] <BlackRag> @RazorKameo and you believe FIFA won't have a game in 2023? They broke apart in the 90's and early 2000's
[2022-12-08 19:14:02] <franktanks6999> Game is just recycled it’s a recycled gimmick recycled gameplay

[2022-12-08 19:14:06] <%+saaj003> i dont even log in anymore. I watch the stream at 6 in hope and then realise there is no point logging in so get on with my evening
[2022-12-08 19:14:07] <+MarkChampion00> Feels like content is only catered towards people who spend fifa points. Content = open packs with fifa points
[2022-12-08 19:14:08] <+freakpants> they dont need us
[2022-12-08 19:14:13] <@%Viperlization> I'm actually turning off my PS

[2022-12-08 19:14:20] <1xnightx1> so disappointed, literally went on the game for only 2 minutes
[2022-12-08 19:14:20] <BEANZLORD> they don't care cos suckers still spend loads of money on ultimate team packs
[2022-12-08 19:14:21] <+freakpants> all thats left for us is to move on
[2022-12-08 19:14:21] <tomangoes> nep lad have u ever considered moving away from fifa content
[2022-12-08 19:14:22] <novaxsonic> lol no icon SBC refresh
[2022-12-08 19:14:24] <%$istreet98> why don't you only upload 6pm content when there is something good?
[2022-12-08 19:14:25] <+Remizzle> @Viperlization  NOOOOOOOOOOO
[2022-12-08 19:14:27] <shash2701> who cares about data when you know you are not going to be ethere next year
[2022-12-08 19:14:28] <xMrMojo> doesnt matter what you say, FIFA or EA will never listen because all they want is money
[2022-12-08 19:14:29] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> I know that the number of people that grind League SBC's is low. But they make up a large portion of the hardcore players and the online community as a whole.   With no repeatable grind, this game is dying. For a small portion, but an important portion nonetheless.
[2022-12-08 19:14:31] <Mikey1289> And there's never gonna be another Winter World Cup
[2022-12-08 19:14:33] <+RazorKameo> @BlackRag literally never said that. fifa are gonna go with a different company most likely. just not EA

[2022-12-08 19:14:58] <rimo1999> I remember back in fifa 20 when I packed 2 icons from marquee matchups
[2022-12-08 19:15:00] <tenyal> @SpreadsheetFifa thats going to do nothing

[2022-12-08 19:15:06] <Piff_Giddy> the RTG'ers aren't impoirtant to EA cos they DONT SPEND MONEYU
[2022-12-08 19:15:09] <%$jake1q1> Best thing they’ve done for ages is when they added the old school music into the game 😱😂 it’s tragic 😂
[2022-12-08 19:15:09] <%LA__2K> New loading screen @NepentheZ
[2022-12-08 19:15:09] <stinpickle> No icon refresh they literally pushed it back another day lollll

[2022-12-08 19:15:13] <@%Viperlization> I'll finish them off before I turn off my PS then
[2022-12-08 19:15:21] <BlackRag> @RazorKameo FIFA 23 is not 2023. It's a game in decades of development. FIFA did not hire any of the top 3 studios... you do the math.
[2022-12-08 19:15:21] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> @tenyal I know but I have to scream at a wall to make myself feel better

[2022-12-08 19:15:37] <%+ray_rockwood> Nep this isn't a troll question, this is my first FIFA game since the last world cup (18), did the other FIFA games have good content? (19,20,21,22)?
[2022-12-08 19:15:37] <casualguy_57> ea being ea
[2022-12-08 19:15:38] <%+saaj003> I think that's where the problem is in this GAME. The menu content is so important because people want to do so much outside of actually playing the game, because servers are heavy, gameplay can be unfair, and the game modes available are more often than not unrewarding
[2022-12-08 19:15:39] <+eugol_nanor> @dav1d21 its anyones choice
[2022-12-08 19:15:40] <vulture3i> @dav1d21 yep
[2022-12-08 19:15:41] <@%Viperlization> Need the ones with lots of commons
[2022-12-08 19:15:44] <+roachd321> EA tried to pull the wool over the casuals by spamming loads of stuff in the first week then when you actually start playing through it you release there’s nothing substantial but for people who play like 1hr per day (EA target audience) it looks like there’s loads when in reality there isn’t
[2022-12-08 19:15:47] <mrjo7777> Any good content guys ?
[2022-12-08 19:15:51] <novaxsonic> boring

[2022-12-08 19:15:55] <sayaroed> dont do it! its a trap
[2022-12-08 19:15:57] <+steviek4> As long Castro Bateson Danny Aaron’s are ripping packs open EA will be happy
[2022-12-08 19:15:58] <@%Viperlization> out of rares
[2022-12-08 19:15:58] <%$istreet98> only do 6pm content when there is something good if you're worried about being a broken record
[2022-12-08 19:16:00] <@%Viperlization> but yeah true
[2022-12-08 19:16:01] <%Frog1786> I haven't turned it on since saturday
[2022-12-08 19:16:01] <+callumc9700> While people continue to spend £££ on this horrendous game nothing will improve unfortunately. They’ve been phasing out everything that the community enjoyed over the past few years. Not only do we have to suffer horrendous gameplay, we now suffer horrendous content. Been playing Fifa since 2003 😂 and it’s never been as bad or as unejoyable as this. Stop playing sooner every year now such a shame
[2022-12-08 19:16:09] <joshlyons02> Did an icon sec to try regain my love for the game and big Alan Shearer walks out I love this game
[2022-12-08 19:16:11] <jancey07> You don’t reckon fifa want to focus on the World Cup rather a ea game
[2022-12-08 19:16:14] <$supahmarioo> What happened to xhaka sbc 😩
[2022-12-08 19:16:15] <mrjo7777> @eugol_nanor BibleThump SeemsGood
[2022-12-08 19:16:18] <novaxsonic> nothing to grind or do in FIFA
[2022-12-08 19:16:19] <+eugol_nanor> @steviek4 every content creator opens packs for content , it makes sense
[2022-12-08 19:16:20] <+WaynesWorld20_> Even their promos aren’t consistent. Last week we had Schwin & RVP. This week only Puyol. This week no Stories SBC player, only in packs & 1 objective.

[2022-12-08 19:18:00] <%+katakuri> EA are basically the glazer family. the pack-addicta are season ticket holders they RELY on for cash but they also think EA/the glazers care about their opinions. they don't. they just exploit the addiction for cash.

[2022-12-08 19:20:37] <tomangoes> i have baby r9 mid drogba and keane  gouvu and am still tempted to do the morientos card
[2022-12-08 19:20:41] <+johnnyw40> This last week of swaps seems more of a grind then usual
[2022-12-08 19:20:44] <RonaIdinho> xerveaMarleBrainCellProblm
[2022-12-08 19:20:48] <Romzcek11> Where is dad?
[2022-12-08 19:21:00] <xlibbyx11> @jakesmith_ why am i ?????
[2022-12-08 19:21:02] <stinpickle> It’s because all the sweats are on doing all the swaps at once for vier
[2022-12-08 19:21:09] <tomangoes> 3.5k discard price is decent tbf
[2022-12-08 19:21:11] <JammieDodge191> People who make subs in Golden goal swaps are a disgrace to society lmao
[2022-12-08 19:21:20] <0liplays> Did the icon pack get re released? No point logging on if not lol
[2022-12-08 19:21:21] <+johnnyw40> Morientes would have been a beast before the patch
[2022-12-08 19:21:33] <stinpickle> I just leave if someone pauses at the start of first goal swap lol
[2022-12-08 19:21:38] <ZpaceMag> neppoRedcard to EA
[2022-12-08 19:21:38] <campcrystal> @JammieDodge191 Why? My team is rubbish otherwise.
[2022-12-08 19:21:47] <tomangoes> @0liplays no, but the good news is theres a morroco challenge for a gold players pack!
[2022-12-08 19:21:48] <akidude1993> Boys. I went 90 minutes in the swap friendly without a goal. Im ded
[2022-12-08 19:21:56] <stinpickle> I don’t understand how icon pack got extended a day lol
[2022-12-08 19:22:00] <Johqvist82> is anything selling guys??
[2022-12-08 19:22:02] <stinpickle> They literally said 3 days it would refresh
[2022-12-08 19:22:07] <JammieDodge191> @campcrystal your team can’t be rubbish, you can have 5 non World Cup players. Making subs is scummy
[2022-12-08 19:22:08] <casualguy_57> @akidude1993 swaps grind is hard fr
[2022-12-08 19:22:10] <stinpickle> And then extended it to Friday lol
[2022-12-08 19:22:18] <%+ray_rockwood> Morientes is a half beast. Some games he does nothing, the other games he scores a hat trick for me.
[2022-12-08 19:22:31] <+johnnyw40> If people start making subs in swaps I just quit as I ain’t interested, pointless
[2022-12-08 19:22:34] <deziixixv> @akidude1993 OG at that point LUL
[2022-12-08 19:22:48] <tomangoes> @ray_rockwood I can honestly hand on heart say I'd rather face cryuff than morientes
[2022-12-08 19:23:00] <%+katakuri> @jammiedodge191 only true if you haven't got 6defenders or 3gk or something like that. Im not a fan but I get why some ppl do it
[2022-12-08 19:23:02] <+jakesmith_> @stinpickle 3 days + 23 hours bozo
[2022-12-08 19:23:04] <sayaroed> dead game in desember nice
[2022-12-08 19:23:07] <campcrystal> @JammieDodge191 Depends on the positions of the world cup players I have. It is sensible, not scummy.
[2022-12-08 19:23:13] <raqiet> @johnnyw40 me too  man
[2022-12-08 19:23:23] <MM02_TTV> @jakesmith_ nope it was meant to be today
[2022-12-08 19:23:27] <+howdyitsdavid> I have enjoyed Morientes at CF but playing Forlan lately, think Morientes physicality might make him better though.
[2022-12-08 19:23:45] <%+ray_rockwood> Has anyone went to PENS in WC swaps? I've went to the second overtime and lost. Lulz
[2022-12-08 19:23:48] <+phr3shajayy> @jakesmith_ nope hes right. 3 days + 23 hours....
[2022-12-08 19:23:50] <casualguy_57> is kostic from swaps a good card even though he is 3* 3* ?
[2022-12-08 19:24:02] <+lloydyy_> ppl fr completing morientes?? alekMOU
[2022-12-08 19:24:02] <+jesusalva5> ….
[2022-12-08 19:24:04] <+giuseppe_esq> I love trying to defend against Mbappe and R9 using Tunisian defenders in swaps
[2022-12-08 19:24:15] <%Hero_CHW> @casualguy_57 hes an alright bb if you swap him to CM ingame
[2022-12-08 19:24:26] <+jakesmith_> @lloydyy_ 2020ByeGuys
[2022-12-08 19:24:30] <+johnnyw40> Jesus and I thought going to half time seemed harsh lol 90 min without a goal and extra time
[2022-12-08 19:24:44] <+lloydyy_> @jakesmith_ demisuxBlush
[2022-12-08 19:24:45] <casualguy_57> @hero_chw then ig I am doing I have 20 tokens

[2022-12-08 19:24:52] <xlibbyx11> @jakesmith_ why am i an idiot ????
[2022-12-08 19:24:52] <%+ray_rockwood> Morientes strength stat is a lie. Anytime he gets touched he loses the ball, even with a Hawk! So I put a Hunter on him.
[2022-12-08 19:24:56] <+howdyitsdavid> My upfront options include WC hero icons Smolarek, Forlorn, and Morientes. I am still a terrible player though.
[2022-12-08 19:24:59] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> What we saying? "Its The Hope That Kills You" or "EA Find New Ways To Disappoint Us"?

[2022-12-08 19:25:36] <+giuseppe_esq> I’ve played several opponents in swaps who park the bus, then just counter with lobbed throughball to a speedy striker lol
[2022-12-08 19:25:36] <+howdyitsdavid> @TardisRavenclaw apparently not.
[2022-12-08 19:25:39] <%+Kieran96cfc> would youtube even let you put kills in the title

[2022-12-08 19:28:49] <Snippyyy> @stinpickle understandable
[2022-12-08 19:28:50] <%+ray_rockwood> 84x3 is cool except when you get duplicates that the game makes you discard for nothing. Just like those 100 player untraceable packs.

[2022-12-08 19:32:50] <+dean_valentine> yep, it was repeatable after 3 days.
[2022-12-08 19:32:50] <ovowalt> just saw your phenom vid and fully agree so many players they couldve easily used enzo gavi gvardiol etc
[2022-12-08 19:32:53] <+ElzoG> yes
[2022-12-08 19:32:53] <MDMFifa19> Was supposed to be tomorrow
[2022-12-08 19:33:05] <deziixixv> ST son on 18
[2022-12-08 19:33:16] <+phr3shajayy> if you check on the web app it shows the actual timer
[2022-12-08 19:33:18] <stinpickle> They actually took it away lol
[2022-12-08 19:33:19] <+phr3shajayy> its tomorrow
[2022-12-08 19:33:24] <+jacobyjones715> No it was suppose to be today
[2022-12-08 19:33:24] <opaza01> it was tomorrow
[2022-12-08 19:33:25] <+FlushFactory52> It's just bloody boring.  I want to grind the game and spend time earning whatever I can.  If others want to pay for a short cut then that's up to them.  For people like me though who can't afford pay to win I have no options available  and the gameplay grind that is available is just not worth it.  Playing this game is not supposed to feel like a chore.
[2022-12-08 19:33:26] <MDMFifa19> Yeah I was man
[2022-12-08 19:33:32] <ashinch1> whats was the content today
[2022-12-08 19:33:32] <%+ray_rockwood> Making that ICON SBC not repeatable is actually a gift to players.
[2022-12-08 19:33:36] <%$deathskamikaze> sure it was meant to be today

[2022-12-08 19:35:35] <DavyeBee24> Yeah i won the 2k win a thon last night and got $15 worth of vc, pretty good specially when u get a bye to the final😂

[2022-12-08 19:35:41] <sacwan123> do u think even league sbc can save this game, im not sure
[2022-12-08 19:35:48] <franktanks6999> EA don’t want to release them due to tooo many people hoarding packs during TOTY
[2022-12-08 19:35:49] <deejay025> neppoPenref
[2022-12-08 19:35:59] <Mikey1289> And there's never gonna be another Winter World Cup

[2022-12-08 19:36:09] <zivhnn> Is the icon sbc repeatable? im pretty sure it said repeatble in 3 days but it isnt updated yet
[2022-12-08 19:36:09] <Draziel21> donations dont appear in the stream?
[2022-12-08 19:36:10] <markw924> have all the swap tokens been released yet?
[2022-12-08 19:36:11] <+worbutton222> i be real i dont think ea want league sbcs
[2022-12-08 19:36:12] <trippyerror> i hate toty pack weight is so horrendous
[2022-12-08 19:36:26] <+dexterrrr_> yeah toty has gotten progressively worse
[2022-12-08 19:36:28] <+eugol_nanor> 3 days 23 hours or whatewver
[2022-12-08 19:36:34] <futsharky> nah they have to increase the power curve during toty
[2022-12-08 19:36:37] <%$deathskamikaze> ah that makes sense
[2022-12-08 19:36:39] <+silversainttv> yo nep how much of a joke they never relased the xhaka card
[2022-12-08 19:36:39] <$Th1sSecretN1nj4> toty will be outdone by the next promo after it. it used to be TOTY was good kill march/april now its just another promo
[2022-12-08 19:36:43] <franktanks6999> Your correct toty are not like the old days toty back then we’re the CRÈME DE LA crème of FUT MISS the hood ole days
[2022-12-08 19:36:43] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> @theoldmanrtg7619 you can't say "Get F*****" in the chat, doesnt matter how many times you post it
[2022-12-08 19:36:43] <+howdyitsdavid> no idea how TOTY can be any better than the second group of WC yellow cards, or the phenoms, or a ton of other stuff recently.
[2022-12-08 19:36:48] <+phr3shajayy> big facts
[2022-12-08 19:36:53] <%+ray_rockwood> Yeah save 100 packs for TOTY to get a cheeky Keylor Navas.
[2022-12-08 19:36:56] <+FlushFactory52> What I don't understand is why they didn't release a world cup league sbcs to run for this season then go to domestic league sbcs next season.
[2022-12-08 19:36:59] <MDMFifa19> It should been Friday the pack, there’s a 0 next to icon pack expires in 2 days
[2022-12-08 19:37:08] <tbreezy111> i think the potm usa guy is legit.  what chem style though?
[2022-12-08 19:37:17] <+dean_valentine> whatever happened to that leaked Xhaka card that was supposedly coming.
[2022-12-08 19:37:17] <ovowalt> if it refreshes when i have a squad com[pleted does it reset that squad

[2022-12-08 19:37:32] <+noshushing> league sbcs wont come this year, ea are happy just giving us those lame cup rewards
[2022-12-08 19:37:38] <+WaynesWorld20_> The promos are just backwards. Last week we had two WC Icon SBCs. This week one. Stories promo this week with no SBC content for a stories card. All just weird.

[2022-12-08 19:39:37] <+Crooksabio> why didn't they make WC SBCs where we can use those red cards. Would have at least given them a value worth grinding for. Even if reward was draft tokens... anything
[2022-12-08 19:39:38] <+jefzy_> @howdyitsdavid why not?
[2022-12-08 19:39:39] <novaxsonic> do Croatia have a chance to win against Brazil?
[2022-12-08 19:39:41] <+kilvino> what do you mean toty is not as premium? We don't have cards close to say a 98 Mbappe or a 96 kdb
[2022-12-08 19:39:43] <MDMFifa19> I did pack 87 Alberto Carlos from a 25k pack a few weeks ago, hope you get some luck mate

[2022-12-08 19:40:01] <tbreezy111> an engine or maestro on the POTM eredivisie guy?
[2022-12-08 19:40:05] <+howdyitsdavid> Im thinking about building 80 rare packs using everything I have 80 and 81 just to see if I can get something special. 80s and 81s might be the most pointless tier of cards.
[2022-12-08 19:40:05] <+SegaBoy1988> anyone else had a pen given when it was half a mile outside the box ?
[2022-12-08 19:40:05] <thenerd9777> Someone can get injured

[2022-12-08 19:41:39] <masatex7> Is it me or the gameplay feels super bad, like players are not reacting fast, is like they are also on ice and the AI not working correctly when defending.  Thoughts?
[2022-12-08 19:41:40] <lfc_99> Anyone have a cold atm
[2022-12-08 19:41:41] <sudamericollin> started doing careermode challeges, and I love it
[2022-12-08 19:41:42] <+IceColdLemonodd> I think thats the nail in the coffin for 60 tokens
[2022-12-08 19:41:46] <keith_mercer89> What do u think of 87 OTW Nunez ?
[2022-12-08 19:41:48] <Firm_Zephyr> Did they drop wcs Xhaka ?
[2022-12-08 19:41:48] <sacwan123> I hope another company picks up the FIFA franchise and reaches out to content creators like u, Nick, Inception etc, could capture some of the market if they create game designed for us. Casuals will follow wherever the hype is.
[2022-12-08 19:41:48] <+mensgold> is ake and viera a good option ?
[2022-12-08 19:41:49] <%+jaythemillerman> some mammoth stream yesterday nep, did you feel it this morning when you got up. felt like a struggle bet you get backaches n headaches etc when stream like that

[2022-12-08 19:42:02] <stinpickle> Nep why do you think EA ruined manual defense in favor for AI defense??
[2022-12-08 19:42:03] <+jefzy_> @icecoldlemonodd we’re getting 60
[2022-12-08 19:42:06] <diaminator1> @johnthegg thanks for the explanation. much appreciated
[2022-12-08 19:42:06] <%teksmex> so there's going to be a. Fifa game and ea game next year?
[2022-12-08 19:42:15] <DavyeBee24> @lfc_99 Majority of ppl do this time of year specially kids cause there at school
[2022-12-08 19:42:15] <%FUTDAN26> Finally got my 20th token for 3x84 packs
[2022-12-08 19:42:16] <novaxsonic> It would be o good to see Argentina vs Portugal in final
[2022-12-08 19:42:18] <+madforlan> Nepp we need content

[2022-12-08 19:42:24] <+jrossino> I’ve pretty much stopped playing fifa now
[2022-12-08 19:42:25] <+Crooksabio> don't see Croatia having a sniff myself. Brazil just to strong. Can make 5 subs and barely weaken their side
[2022-12-08 19:42:30] <+jrossino> Game just isn’t worth playing
[2022-12-08 19:42:34] <+IceColdLemonodd> @jefzy_ what makes you think that?
[2022-12-08 19:42:35] <%+aarona93> ea have truly made me go off the game. I loved grinding the game. I would be starting a toty grind now. but no league SBCs and nothing to really grind. I'm playing the new Pokémon game and having far more fun!!!
[2022-12-08 19:42:36] <airball22> I can’t believe brozovic is only 90k he’s so much better than palinha
[2022-12-08 19:42:38] <+DanX098> FG
[2022-12-08 19:42:42] <Richm1996> that sounds like hell LUL
[2022-12-08 19:42:44] <johnthegg> aren't there rumors of no transfer market next year? not sure how that'd work
[2022-12-08 19:42:45] <trippyerror> different name same trash content
[2022-12-08 19:42:47] <lfc_99> @davyebee24 yeah that’s true
[2022-12-08 19:42:48] <%+thecomedian1996> @airball22 he really ins't
[2022-12-08 19:42:50] <futsharky> who's ur fav attacker in the game so far¿
[2022-12-08 19:42:50] <%+ray_rockwood> Any chance Konami gets the FIFA license?
[2022-12-08 19:42:51] <%+howdyitsdavid> Nep what do you think about building 80+ gold rares from 80s-82s since that's a pretty useless tier of cards given the current state of SBCs? at least this is playing the lottery somewhat.
[2022-12-08 19:42:51] <%+Kieran96cfc> what would probably happen is fifa doesnt find another game company and probably go back to EA
[2022-12-08 19:42:52] <deziixixv> ea sports 20.4
[2022-12-08 19:42:53] <%+joshua12012000> how r ya my friend
[2022-12-08 19:42:59] <%+RfcHarry07> any of the showdown sbcs worth it?
[2022-12-08 19:43:00] <tyhi17> why are people getting viera when palinha is basically the same card
[2022-12-08 19:43:04] <deano1123> will you stick with eas game or will you make content on ufl, goals or whoever fifa license with
[2022-12-08 19:43:05] <+jefzy_> @icecoldlemonodd packs in the database that will have tokens
[2022-12-08 19:43:05] <%+thecomedian1996> brozovic is 5'11, Palhinha is 6'3
[2022-12-08 19:43:08] <%FUTDAN26> Love that there’s going to be a threshold for limiteds now
[2022-12-08 19:43:08] <+Ur_ex_neighbour> @rfcharry07 No
[2022-12-08 19:43:11] <JacobWRLD420> If there’s no market it’s basically pes LUL
[2022-12-08 19:43:13] <ItsWaterMan> Nep, who do you think the TOTY midfield will be?
[2022-12-08 19:43:14] <fcbdiegut> Should I save my packs for Friday or open them now ?
[2022-12-08 19:43:16] <sudamericollin> there are rumours of no transfermarket, but those things stay rumours
[2022-12-08 19:43:24] <opaza01> Palhinha aint even close to Vieira
[2022-12-08 19:43:27] <%+howdyitsdavid> Thanks Nep I think I am gonna do it and hope for the new Bellingham or Hakimi cards tomorrow.
[2022-12-08 19:43:27] <lDrizzle> will we have to download/ buy the game separately ext year or will it be like an update/ patch to the current game?
[2022-12-08 19:43:29] <+madforlan> Palhinha has shitt pace foor this stge of the game
[2022-12-08 19:43:30] <%+RfcHarry07> depay and acuna look decent no?
[2022-12-08 19:43:31] <%jordan97jw> and you cant get palhinha even if you wanted
[2022-12-08 19:43:33] <ramzihaddad97> What do u value more this year, coins or fodder?
[2022-12-08 19:43:38] <curlyrico> i put vierra at CB, hes good
[2022-12-08 19:43:38] <airball22> Palinha is so heavy and garabge man look at brozovics dribbling
[2022-12-08 19:43:39] <+Bravia60> @tyhi17 stand up comedy
[2022-12-08 19:43:43] <+Ryanboy1213> who's the Portugal player on the loading screen
[2022-12-08 19:43:43] <masatex7> Is it me or the gameplay feels super bad, like players are not reacting fast, is like they are also on ice and the AI not working correctly when defending.  Thoughts?
[2022-12-08 19:43:52] <+Ur_ex_neighbour> that will be the end
[2022-12-08 19:43:53] <tyhi17> palinha and viera’s stats are extremely similar
[2022-12-08 19:43:54] <+madforlan> All the Wc Promo was bad,Bateson said was good content
[2022-12-08 19:43:55] <+mensgold> @curlyrico hes cm only
[2022-12-08 19:43:57] <novaxsonic> Which card comes close to Viera? You're?
[2022-12-08 19:44:00] <saalund> Hi Nep, is all good today?
[2022-12-08 19:44:00] <pyrofut> people who didn't do Vieira on COPIUM
[2022-12-08 19:44:04] <opaza01> @RfcHarry07 look at their in game stats compared to other players in those positions, they're not good imo
[2022-12-08 19:44:08] <+jefzy_> @tyhi17 not even close bud
[2022-12-08 19:44:10] <curlyrico> @curlyrico i do it in custom tatics
[2022-12-08 19:44:13] <+notorious_noob86> still no league SBC's.... what are EA even trying to do man
[2022-12-08 19:44:15] <+eelco_tm> thoughts on what people say "EA want to trash the name FIFA, by no giving content etc" but everybody know EA is the creator of the game.. name is a name..
[2022-12-08 19:44:17] <munakeb> Just sell van dijk and play tomori
[2022-12-08 19:44:17] <%+howdyitsdavid> I was a bit sad on missing out on Viera, I refuse to do that grind, then I packed 88 Matthaus in my icon SBC and felt a bit better.
[2022-12-08 19:44:19] <%bateson87> @madforlan I didnt though did I mate? Its why I banned you in my chat for being a moron
[2022-12-08 19:44:21] <%+joshua12012000> I'm still sad no league SBCS
[2022-12-08 19:44:23] <MackTominay> Evening nep, alright
[2022-12-08 19:44:23] <Snippyyy> At least next year we will know how much fifa does limit ea creative ability
[2022-12-08 19:44:29] <%+gpnick7> what do you usually go to in champs qualis  nep?
[2022-12-08 19:44:33] <+mensgold> people are hhating on people who waiting on viera
[2022-12-08 19:44:38] <johnthegg> LUL bateson
[2022-12-08 19:44:38] <killamanshanks> I don’t get ea. they may want to deter us away from fifa but the way they continuing who says people going to play there game next year considering how they been with this fifa @nepenthez
[2022-12-08 19:44:51] <+boskobalabanster> Did they fix the broken fut moments?
[2022-12-08 19:44:54] <%+RfcHarry07> @RfcHarry07 yeh fair enough i just thought acuna looked ok as a super sub and depay is usually good and 1 will get an upgrade
[2022-12-08 19:44:55] <+notorious_noob86> @NepentheZ what is the end game you think that EA trying to do ? Just push everyone to spend more money on points
[2022-12-08 19:45:05] <eltorrooow> @johnthegg johnnyyyy

[2022-12-08 19:45:06] <+diallox> bateson never going to say anything bad about ea thou is he

[2022-12-08 19:45:36] <opaza01> @RfcHarry07 thats fair I usually prefer special cards too, but they just arent good enough for my team at this stage
[2022-12-08 19:45:40] <%+abueladechicharito> vieira time??
[2022-12-08 19:45:40] <+jrossino> For me I think I’ll typically buy the game every year but I’ve played it properly for like 2 months until I quit yearly
[2022-12-08 19:45:40] <%teksmex> he pays his way carelessly so no he wouldn't say anything bad

[2022-12-08 19:45:50] <eltorrooow> @johnthegg well hopefully we can win tomorrow aswell
[2022-12-08 19:45:51] <%+thecomedian1996> really want acuna to get upgraded
[2022-12-08 19:45:52] <%jjaden10> I reckon they make tots/endgame INSANE to get people with recency bias
[2022-12-08 19:45:54] <ramzihaddad97> Arsenal should pick up Amrabat / Morocco .. such a perfect cdm
[2022-12-08 19:45:55] <diaminator1> is it even feasible for fifa to make their own game unless they own faces scans and licenses on Fifa games
[2022-12-08 19:45:58] BAN: teksmex (600s), teksmex (600s)
[2022-12-08 19:45:59] <stinpickle> I actually think the more likelihood is FIFA is ruining the game to ruin the EA name. Makes a lot more sense that way.
[2022-12-08 19:46:00] <%+ray_rockwood> I still wonder why EA doesn't take the best ideas from FUT, MUT, and HUT, to make the best Ultimate team mode for all three games.  MUT has bundles with toppers, HUT has collections, fifa needs those.
[2022-12-08 19:46:06] <+jefzy_> Everyone out to get Bateson rn 😭
[2022-12-08 19:46:07] <johnthegg> @eltorrooow yeah hope so, good luck!
[2022-12-08 19:46:09] <novaxsonic> Is Puyol worth doing?
[2022-12-08 19:46:10] <shan_234> Oooooo
[2022-12-08 19:46:12] <+jrossino> Fifa streaming numbers are down hard too
[2022-12-08 19:46:14] <%$istreet98> curious, if EA don't invite you to things why don't you take a coin sponsor?
[2022-12-08 19:46:14] <stemil19> why do people bring bad vibes about other content creators, just chill in chat and keep your opinion for yourself
[2022-12-08 19:46:15] <%+jaythemillerman> just because bateson had content on this fifa doesn't mean he won't talk about them. he's a solid streaming who talks his own opinions gg bateson
[2022-12-08 19:46:16] <tyhi17> palinha and viera starts are extremely similar
[2022-12-08 19:46:16] <%+abueladechicharito> really want arsenal to pick up yunus musah
[2022-12-08 19:46:17] <augustusrome> nep can i be a full time mod for u?
[2022-12-08 19:46:18] <+Crooksabio> nep has there been any elite icon you have wanted that when you finally got him, you thought meh!! For example, a gullit or vieira etc...
[2022-12-08 19:46:20] <JacobWRLD420> Bateson is cool he got the swag
[2022-12-08 19:46:22] <jancey07> I feel the removal of fitness cards were the the beginning of the end  because it didn’t have relevant to any other team but your main team
[2022-12-08 19:46:23] <%$lfcplz> @ramzihaddad97 Liverpool have been linked with picking him up in January
[2022-12-08 19:46:26] <%$deathskamikaze> I dont understand why people expect content creators to bad mouth EA. If no one ever streamed fifa again, it would make no difference to EA.
[2022-12-08 19:46:28] <@Calzuhgg> You don't need every ones opinion on everything
[2022-12-08 19:46:28] <%bateson87> im unusre where this "i dont say anything about fifa" comes from lol
[2022-12-08 19:46:28] <trippyerror> most content creators just gave up on complaining cause nothing changes
[2022-12-08 19:46:31] <%+howdyitsdavid> I actually really liked the way other creators responded to the EA rant video for the most part it was really measured and thoughtful.
[2022-12-08 19:46:32] <thenerd9777> Fun
[2022-12-08 19:46:33] <tbreezy111> i traded my swaps for the world cup icon and got zambrotta.  is that a W?
[2022-12-08 19:46:33] <%jjaden10> I reckon they make tots/endgame INSANE to get people with recency bias, until then tho it’ll be like this
[2022-12-08 19:46:37] <futsharky> www
[2022-12-08 19:46:37] <stemil19> vieira woooahhhhhh

[2022-12-08 19:47:03] <Richm1996> they need to do something to entice gameplay as well. Like give me a grindable player that upgrades based on certain things

[2022-12-08 19:49:43] <artofsolo72> viera is end game, absolute beast, perfect dm and makes amazing outside the foot shots. He is like a tank in the midfield
[2022-12-08 19:49:49] <peaky9121> Any game you would like to play on stream with us Nep?
[2022-12-08 19:49:50] <watsooooplays> Was the icon pack not meant to be done again today?

[2022-12-08 19:50:32] <%DmacPrototype> Preview Pack as well Neppo
[2022-12-08 19:50:36] <watsooooplays> @ikester213 I grind my arse off to get it and thought it was today 😂
[2022-12-08 19:50:37] <%+howdyitsdavid> Im not a good player so I feel like I can stick with my base Matthaus for my CDM
[2022-12-08 19:50:37] <%oxjacksonx> 87 Crespo rip
[2022-12-08 19:50:39] <+Ur_ex_neighbour> sissoko is a beast in dm
[2022-12-08 19:50:42] <+TimmyLH44> Swaps is so dead the change to matchmaking has ruined it
[2022-12-08 19:50:43] <+madforlan> No icon swaps this fifa?
[2022-12-08 19:50:45] <ediese> keep getting shadowbanned.... so boring
[2022-12-08 19:50:57] <%+howdyitsdavid> Ive got the Sissoko too, really like it.
[2022-12-08 19:51:14] <+plebalertx> they dont rise much during champs sadly
[2022-12-08 19:51:14] <novaxsonic> i spent most of the swaps in 84X20 (3) pack..got nothing just fodder
[2022-12-08 19:51:17] <+ikester213> @watsooooplays basically if something is repeatable e.g "3 days" then it's 4 basically
[2022-12-08 19:51:20] <%ElTenTwelve_> its way stricter this year it feels
[2022-12-08 19:51:25] <%Post_FUT_Clarity> damn man when you get top 9 nation, but it's England and it's Scholes... :(
[2022-12-08 19:51:33] <mojix7mt> I'd remember we used to snipe shadows
[2022-12-08 19:51:33] <+Ur_ex_neighbour> @howdyitsdavid but he cant pass to save his life
[2022-12-08 19:51:34] <+xxtejkyxx> classic EA
[2022-12-08 19:51:35] <%bateson87> im in 2 now. Swaps was really easy for me this time
[2022-12-08 19:51:35] <+StoneValleyKing> promo pack?
[2022-12-08 19:51:36] <kman3164> Have you played much F1 Manager lately? I think that game is pretty good
[2022-12-08 19:51:37] <iiCal_v1> An error not rectified? very unlike EA
[2022-12-08 19:51:45] <%jjaden10> I reckon they make tots/endgame INSANE to get people with recency bias
[2022-12-08 19:51:48] <%bateson87> im done with rivals now after i remembered sbmm for swaps
[2022-12-08 19:51:49] <+phr3shajayy> that explains why it takes longer sometimes to find games
[2022-12-08 19:51:52] <augustusrome> u hiring?
[2022-12-08 19:51:52] <+ikester213> @watsooooplays so if available for 6 days and repeatable in 3 then its repeatable in 4 days
[2022-12-08 19:51:54] <xBirchh> hi @ElTenTwelve_
[2022-12-08 19:51:59] <dizzydukc> nep how old are you

[2022-12-08 19:52:30] <%whufcconnor> i cant be bothered to play champs though, rivals is all i play
[2022-12-08 19:52:35] <%+flnnlsh> Div1 feels easier than div2 on pc for me
[2022-12-08 19:52:39] <+Shay47_> rivals rewards arent good for me anyways
[2022-12-08 19:52:41] <+pavz_26> the amount of games you have to play for these swaps is just insane
[2022-12-08 19:52:52] <trippyerror> i also regret going past div 4
[2022-12-08 19:52:56] <%+Kieran96cfc> champs is way easier then rivals
[2022-12-08 19:52:59] <%+howdyitsdavid> My mental health wasnt worth the grind I was attempting to do with swaps.
[2022-12-08 19:53:04] <raqiet> i have an acc in div 10 u still match tryhards 60 percent of swap games
[2022-12-08 19:53:04] <%Post_FUT_Clarity> I play GG in rivals
[2022-12-08 19:53:05] <nathanb3586> Games 35 quid now for ps5, it’s so tempting to pick up
[2022-12-08 19:53:05] <%$Phinch23> I hover around  Div 8 on PC for that reason!
[2022-12-08 19:53:06] <+afcgoonerbruh> Tempted to start a new PC RTG and just spam gameplay to get the 84x60 packs for tomorrow and see how quickly i can get a good team
[2022-12-08 19:53:08] <curlyrico> you wanna play bots or comp, players div 10 or not, isnt bad anymore
[2022-12-08 19:53:08] <+TMaier10> theres no incentive to play rivals, the rewards are so underwgelming
[2022-12-08 19:53:13] <%krk0707> hi nep how are you ?
[2022-12-08 19:53:16] <+wheeler126> Champs is way more chill than rivals
[2022-12-08 19:53:17] <+FLoWp0t> Rewards are Bad anyway
[2022-12-08 19:53:21] <novaxsonic> wanted to know the divison rivals give matchups with the same divisions and rivals?
[2022-12-08 19:53:23] <+louisw26> im just gonna stay in div 3 from now after the season resets on just give a few wins away if i get too close now

[2022-12-08 20:28:53] <%ItsTr3ple> Chat, Nep is playing Old Gen atm because it's easier and more responsive. It is generally easier because most of the better players will be playing on PS5, leaving a pool of players overally worse.

[2022-12-08 20:38:38] <%BobbyTambling> @BobbyTambling i did bennacer but didn't do Chiesa ahaha
[2022-12-08 20:38:54] <@%Viperlization> "NepentheZ compares his FIFA 22 RTG vs FIFA 23 RTG"

[2022-12-08 20:39:18] <ovowalt> these guaranteed packs not helping getting guaranteed heroes and icons in november
[2022-12-08 20:39:21] <+wogurt122> I get what chu is saying but we could still have league sbc to grind
[2022-12-08 20:39:22] <gloxiochi> LOL
[2022-12-08 20:39:22] <+diallox> the last 2 years end game cycle is laughable too. I can start an account in august and have the same team as you
[2022-12-08 20:39:22] <SanddW> wow
[2022-12-08 20:39:24] <+jamieharris_96> That chem system looks so weird haha

[2022-12-08 20:39:37] <%+mattyjkellly> or 21
[2022-12-08 20:39:41] <%$coys51> 2-3 month further along
[2022-12-08 20:39:41] <gloxiochi> they're killing this game early cause its their last fifa
[2022-12-08 20:39:44] <jesustrr102> Yeah look at 20 or 21
[2022-12-08 20:39:48] <BlackRag> Both 88 Teams ...
[2022-12-08 20:39:51] <jesustrr102> I'm curious now
[2022-12-08 20:39:52] <%BobbyTambling> and that team has 3 players out of position...
[2022-12-08 20:39:54] <69tw> your bench would be starting in the other team
[2022-12-08 20:39:55] <SamRourke93> That Openda was insane, loved that card
[2022-12-08 20:39:56] <+WillLewGB> What do you think EA should do to change this?
[2022-12-08 20:40:01] <BlackRag> Both 5 Star, 88 rated teams
[2022-12-08 20:40:03] <dizzydukc> nep cristiano ronaldo sui

[2022-12-08 20:40:20] <%+davidanderson20> nep got to div 2 today, i find it way easier than div 3, do u agree?
[2022-12-08 20:40:21] <%+riff_hunter44> Fifa 20
[2022-12-08 20:40:21] <%$lfcplz> every year we say the same thing, the power curve goes up too fast and every year it goes up quicker than the previous year
[2022-12-08 20:40:26] <+hutsmuts_> we cant see it

[2022-12-08 20:42:30] <spennymagic> That fati was wild
[2022-12-08 20:42:38] <%whufcconnor> and this team is probably half the price
[2022-12-08 20:42:38] <%+mattyjkellly> rating?
[2022-12-08 20:42:39] <ali_daei> Away ahead of schedule

[2022-12-08 20:43:28] <greenforestbear89> Fifa 21 waaay clear
[2022-12-08 20:43:32] <SamRourke93> Is the problem that we have WAY too much?
[2022-12-08 20:43:35] <%FUTDAN26> Is it just team 2 World Cup icons in packs right now or are normal icons still in packs?
[2022-12-08 20:43:35] <%+davidanderson20> this is why rtgs are dead wayyy to easy to attain crazy cards, i miss the grind of making a crazy team
[2022-12-08 20:43:35] <AboGeorge93> we need league sbc asap
[2022-12-08 20:43:35] <bspace_> papin isnt overpowered lol
[2022-12-08 20:43:35] <%+kainyk> and none of these players are that new. you could have this a while ago
[2022-12-08 20:43:39] <@%Viperlization> not sure on clips
[2022-12-08 20:43:40] <@%Viperlization> no clips
[2022-12-08 20:43:44] <birtan_ali> The difference is ridiculous
[2022-12-08 20:43:46] <+mrmadrid10> but you enjoyed the game better before
[2022-12-08 20:43:52] <%oxjacksonx> did I miss unban request ep 2?
[2022-12-08 20:43:52] <@%Viperlization> i feel like this is a good main channel vid too though

[2022-12-08 20:43:56] <%+abueladechicharito> bruddah bought 2 100player packs lol
[2022-12-08 20:44:02] <%$istreet98> you sound so much more positive too, despite having a worse team. Its becuase there were things to do
[2022-12-08 20:44:03] <69tw> its not just rtgs. The whole game economy is dead
[2022-12-08 20:44:06] <%+Brandez84> EA should be able to map this with ease, Sept release mainly 83s outside of icons/TOTW, Oct 84s, Nov 85s etc of summit like that
[2022-12-08 20:44:11] <%$coys51> and nep's wasted like 2 mill lol
[2022-12-08 20:44:17] <+danh707> the world cup promo forced ea into bring better players out to early.
[2022-12-08 20:44:25] <+BYCakes> I'm doing a RTG, started a month late and I have 2 million coins without ever packing a player worth over 100k tradeable
[2022-12-08 20:44:30] <@%Viperlization> yeah also remember you've WASTED coins on 23 too
[2022-12-08 20:44:34] <@%Viperlization> thats fkn mental
[2022-12-08 20:44:36] <Wommeh__> think the foundations show how they were in line with the game at the time. now they're dated in week one
[2022-12-08 20:44:42] <calsimpsoni> Guess they’re just going for Quantity over Quality? Because in their eyes the quantitive amount they’re putting out must be quality because they’re making amounts that satisfy them?
[2022-12-08 20:44:46] <%FUTDAN26> Anyone know what special cards are in packs right now please icon wise

[2022-12-08 20:48:05] <%+abueladechicharito> that david neres was nasty
[2022-12-08 20:48:10] <%$lfcplz> I absolutely rinsed my club dry for that Salah
[2022-12-08 20:48:14] <%$coys51> when we got the shit Viera from swops lol
[2022-12-08 20:48:14] <%+riff_hunter44> @riff_hunter44 Thinking were still in 22 Doh
[2022-12-08 20:48:23] <TuKay2K> 100%
[2022-12-08 20:48:25] <Makezuu1> Chiesa is lurking from bench also in 22
[2022-12-08 20:48:26] <%+davidanderson20> surely from a buisness standpoint making it this easy to attain amazing cards is a terrible idea, how are they making more money than ever even tho its so easy to attain godly cards???
[2022-12-08 20:48:34] <%whufcconnor> Salah > Smith-Rowe and this is better
[2022-12-08 20:48:35] <TuKay2K> mine is just as similar rtg mode
[2022-12-08 20:48:38] <ramzihaddad97> Guys help, got soft ban from playing swaps.. what do i do?
[2022-12-08 20:48:47] <69tw> when the whole bench is better than the starting teams from before LUL power creep is real
[2022-12-08 20:48:49] <%+bluenoserfc1> instead of an RTG why not just my account, and its just you doing you, if you want some FP for a promo you do it. it just a series based on how you choose to play as opposed to any restrictions on the series
[2022-12-08 20:48:58] <BlackRag> Not much difference ... You got better at the game, expect better team earlier each year ..
[2022-12-08 20:49:00] <ramzihaddad97> Guys help, got soft ban from playing swaps.. what do i do??
[2022-12-08 20:49:03] <Benz_soloelite1> true
[2022-12-08 20:49:07] <%BobbyTambling> minimum effort is an exageration imo
[2022-12-08 20:49:12] <BlackRag> your 22 team was 88 too ...
[2022-12-08 20:49:14] <@%Viperlization> You should do this every month imo
[2022-12-08 20:49:20] <@%Viperlization> Like a mini series for the clips channel
[2022-12-08 20:49:20] <%$istreet98> You sounded happier back then on those previous fifas too. Despite having a worse team there were things to grind for
[2022-12-08 20:49:26] <+diallox> cant forget about the shared market having the biggest impact on all of this
[2022-12-08 20:49:26] <%BobbyTambling> vieira alone was 40 tokens

[2022-12-08 20:49:38] <KingAustin> @ramzihaddad97 wait
[2022-12-08 20:49:44] <kryp____> isn't it good at some point to have a team like this though? i get it's good to grind but i think it's not so much the players it's the fact we have nothing to grind, hence why we. need league sbcs
[2022-12-08 20:49:50] <ramzihaddad97> @kingaustin how much?
[2022-12-08 20:49:54] <iiCal_v1> @BobbyTambling He's a full time content creator, it is minimal in terms of what HE could do
[2022-12-08 20:49:54] <TreWinz22> that openda though
[2022-12-08 20:49:55] <@%Viperlization> Cool to see
[2022-12-08 20:49:57] <+rratzoi> EA gave us win count and it's broken for 3 weeks in a row now
[2022-12-08 20:49:57] <thesheriff96> So you would rather ea make you need to spend fifa points?

[2022-12-08 20:50:20] <%BobbyTambling> @BobbyTambling i disagree, it wasn't minimal effort to get the team Nep has

[2022-12-08 20:52:41] <%ItsTr3ple> Chat, Nep is playing Old Gen atm because it's easier and more responsive. It is generally easier because most of the better players will be playing on PS5, leaving a pool of players overally worse. @groovyjona
[2022-12-08 20:52:44] <jesustrr102> never seen a team displayed like that
[2022-12-08 20:52:48] <jesustrr102> this old gen?

[2022-12-08 20:53:04] <+jdealmeida719> I feel like people lose interest with all the leaks, don’t get me wrong, I don’t mind them, but it’s killing the game.. what’s your opinion on that?

[2022-12-08 21:26:25] <%sorarejosh> its gonna be hard no xp no captain  bonus
[2022-12-08 21:26:32] <@%ItsHaber> Unique will be expensive for sure
[2022-12-08 21:26:44] <@%Witchwalker70> Yes the no captain is going to be a pain
[2022-12-08 21:27:06] <+SpentBuffalo> looks like we won't get that xhaka card
[2022-12-08 21:27:13] <@%Viperlization> Lemme show you what i've done
[2022-12-08 21:27:14] <%MattFUTTrading> Has WC Vieira changed everything for you Neppo?
[2022-12-08 21:27:18] <%lewishester1> Love the stream!
[2022-12-08 21:27:32] <@%Viperlization> Have a goosey
[2022-12-08 21:27:44] <%$istreet98> imagine if you learn that corner technioque now
[2022-12-08 21:27:46] <Aaronish> is van dijks gold car the 3rd best cb in the game? behind wc story dijk and wc hero lucio? thoughts appreciated guys
[2022-12-08 21:27:50] <Aaronish> *card
[2022-12-08 21:27:52] <%+gpnick7> I had his baby so went cafu
[2022-12-08 21:27:54] <tyhi17> because palinha is the same card
[2022-12-08 21:27:54] <here4rewards_> manually moving Vieira to near post on corners is a cheat code
[2022-12-08 21:28:02] <%tja_100> we need a usable xhaka!
[2022-12-08 21:28:07] <tyhi17> compare palinha and viera stats
[2022-12-08 21:28:09] <jakeeetx> WC Blanc is the best CB ive used even better Lucio IMO
[2022-12-08 21:28:09] <%$TraFFi_csgo> was forced to take coman for my bayern collection book, so took fodder packs with 35 anyways
[2022-12-08 21:28:13] <FrancoJavierM> yeah i totally regret not getting Vieira
[2022-12-08 21:28:15] <%+iamterry1997> I’m going for him but the grind is long🙄
[2022-12-08 21:28:18] <woolywhite> What i want to know from EA is,  where the feck is all the World Cup content/promos/specials motm/informs ,  as hello EA ,  it's only the biggest football tournament and probly been watched by 1Billion people,  dumb company,  sorry small rant :) VirtualHug PartyTime
[2022-12-08 21:28:19] <@%Viperlization> I'm too PS shit for that
[2022-12-08 21:28:23] <grantmc23> i opened the 84x 20 packs and got moments R9 so i think it was worth
[2022-12-08 21:28:23] <%tja_100> imagine a midfield of xhaka viera and party
[2022-12-08 21:28:28] <signingpoem9620> But Cafu looks insane aswell that's kinda the problem you can only get 1 icon
[2022-12-08 21:28:29] <@%Viperlization> No bait
[2022-12-08 21:28:31] <+Jezrien___> @tyhi17 yeah you need to put two shadows on palhina to be close LUL
[2022-12-08 21:28:32] <ajfromak88> Left stick better on old gen?
[2022-12-08 21:28:33] <+HamsaOmar786> Took fodder packs & Fabinho
[2022-12-08 21:28:33] <+four_directions> Bruno is better
[2022-12-08 21:28:34] <%ItsTr3ple> The Fifa 21 is the furthest away from this year in terms of quality for the tumbnail could enforce the point ?
[2022-12-08 21:28:36] <$KuncheeYute> You’re right, Palhinha is better lol
[2022-12-08 21:28:48] <JimmyTheBits> Can do that in Paint
[2022-12-08 21:28:48] <tyhi17> and palinha will likely get a 5 star week foot
[2022-12-08 21:28:54] <%+abueladechicharito> i could do that in google docs
[2022-12-08 21:28:59] <zlatani97> i can do it?
[2022-12-08 21:29:00] <%mannyn90> chat do i take ake & 82x20 or take the 84x20
[2022-12-08 21:29:04] <$KuncheeYute> Palhinha may not be as fast but otherwise, he’s better Kreygasm Kreygasm
[2022-12-08 21:29:04] <+tjb1492> Would you say vieira is worth getting if I have ptg de Jong and World Cup marchisio already?
[2022-12-08 21:29:20] <+thenorwegiandrogba> Should I full send on 80+ for tommorow?
[2022-12-08 21:29:34] <%Post_FUT_Clarity> are people actually comparing Palhinha to VIEIRA LUL
[2022-12-08 21:29:37] <+Jezrien___> In a game where pace is all that matters- that’s important @kuncheeyute LUL
[2022-12-08 21:29:47] <JimmyTheBits> pen tool works
[2022-12-08 21:30:28] <%+OhSxnch> If i chose the 84x20 x3 initially is there enough tokens to then go for Viera?
[2022-12-08 21:30:34] <+four_directions> Bruno too
[2022-12-08 21:30:36] <$KuncheeYute> @jezrien___ Not really cuz in my 10 - 0 qual run, Palhinha got MOTM numerous times. You just need to be in the right position
[2022-12-08 21:30:40] <%+abueladechicharito> 9 more pace huge difference
[2022-12-08 21:30:50] <+four_directions> The Brazilan Bruno
[2022-12-08 21:31:06] <%+aniron123> I was watching bugs stream earlier he was playing paliniha and he said he's insane
[2022-12-08 21:31:08] <+vCaleb1> Both great cards
[2022-12-08 21:31:12] <+mesut1o88> bruno G compared to vieirra?
[2022-12-08 21:31:20] <TomKwanten> should i sell laporte he is instinct?
[2022-12-08 21:31:21] <+Jezrien___> Bruno G is shit in game
[2022-12-08 21:31:21] <luke123895> fabinho better
[2022-12-08 21:31:21] <yo_pieerree> Patrick is just better
[2022-12-08 21:31:21] [Notification] kaigoddard19 subscribed with Prime.
[2022-12-08 21:31:22] <+loris_00_> Also Vieiras body type is unique in FIFA…even not considering stats
[2022-12-08 21:31:24] <+vCaleb1> 5 star on the small guy gonna be good though if they win
[2022-12-08 21:31:30] <congressman_7> compare with Brozovic
[2022-12-08 21:31:31] <+dannyru> Fifa down ?
[2022-12-08 21:31:31] <freysi123> can you compare vieira to the swaps Fabinho?
[2022-12-08 21:31:37] <sakaszn96> in game its not even close, vieira clear
[2022-12-08 21:31:37] <+lhunty> I got vieira today. wow what a player
[2022-12-08 21:31:48] <%+spo2_> Vieira is the best card Ive used by far
[2022-12-08 21:31:48] <here4rewards_> Vieira innit, he has that juice
[2022-12-08 21:31:49] <+1stform> Icons just have a different type of feel in game
[2022-12-08 21:31:49] <$KuncheeYute> Lmao he rushed over the stats that Palhinha is better at LUL LUL
[2022-12-08 21:31:54] <+1stform> They have an aura
[2022-12-08 21:31:55] <+imythias> viera could be worse in every stat and still would be better in game
[2022-12-08 21:31:56] <samy1744> Vieira always the best dm
[2022-12-08 21:31:56] <%+abueladechicharito> any physical over 90 doesn't really make a difference ... feel like body type has a bigger impact.
[2022-12-08 21:31:58] <$KuncheeYute> Didn’t spend no time on defending or physical
[2022-12-08 21:32:04] <AbdelhamidT> portugal isnt winning so its okay
[2022-12-08 21:32:10] <+vCaleb1> Got 32 tokens hoping ea releases 8 more “)
[2022-12-08 21:32:13] <+Jezrien___> @kuncheeyute I have Pal too- played a few with both of them- he’s a nice card but he’s not near Patty
[2022-12-08 21:32:13] <dav1d21> How is Van Persie?
[2022-12-08 21:32:14] <SanddW> monkaS
[2022-12-08 21:32:14] <+xVENOMx313x> I should be getting Viera today and cant wait man

[2022-12-08 21:32:22] <%mannyn90> kunchee is an edgelord in zwes chat too lol
[2022-12-08 21:32:23] <tyhi17> palinha has a good chance of getting upgrading too
[2022-12-08 21:32:24] <+celtlc> Ban that idiot.
[2022-12-08 21:32:24] BAN: KuncheeYute
[2022-12-08 21:32:24] <willshire232323> What about the potential 5* WF upgrade?
[2022-12-08 21:32:28] <grenadier2> @KuncheeYute smh bro Kappa HeyGuys
[2022-12-08 21:32:30] <+thenorwegiandrogba> Stats aint everything lmfao, look at Renato Sanches
[2022-12-08 21:32:32] <burnsyla> bye byeee
[2022-12-08 21:32:39] <burnsyla> n28HeyGuys
[2022-12-08 21:32:41] <ifbbsami> People who Compare this weird palinha with Viera Never Played with Viera
[2022-12-08 21:32:43] <@Calzuhgg> What div are the rewards for? 2?
[2022-12-08 21:32:45] <+thegoslow> byyyyye
[2022-12-08 21:32:49] <%+Conormcgovern> Viara
[2022-12-08 21:32:50] <kingRahman11> vieira is legit better at everything. looks like people have never played this game for years and dont know that stats dont matter on certain cards
[2022-12-08 21:32:52] <tyhi17> i’m just saying idk if the 40 tokens was worth it
[2022-12-08 21:32:55] <+SHlGZ> AND DON'T COME BACK!! lol
[2022-12-08 21:32:55] DELETED: SHlGZ (AND DON'T COME BACK!! lol)
[2022-12-08 21:32:55] <@^Nightbot> @SHlGZ -> Yeah, this should help. [stop spamming caps] [warning]
[2022-12-08 21:32:56] <%+abueladechicharito> rulebreakers promo W or L?
[2022-12-08 21:32:58] <+imythias> are people seriously arguing for paulinha over vieira?
[2022-12-08 21:32:58] <%Post_FUT_Clarity> edgelord, get gone kuntee
[2022-12-08 21:33:01] <$Cedsam_88> ppl defending Paulinha are just trying to feel better cause they didn't do Vieira
[2022-12-08 21:33:03] <joshie2108> Gud team
[2022-12-08 21:33:05] <ifbbsami> Viera is by far the best cdm
[2022-12-08 21:33:07] <+raup11> Booby Moore is more soo goooooood
[2022-12-08 21:33:07] <gdeacon1> renato sanche OTW is the best card ive used this year by far
[2022-12-08 21:33:10] <+thenorwegiandrogba> Stats aint everything. People never listen
[2022-12-08 21:33:10] <+AlmightySenKai> if stats were everything Gold Ronaldo wouldn't be as damn good as he is. Those in game animations and his feel is unmatched
[2022-12-08 21:33:10] <shantoudiin> viera is class  👌
[2022-12-08 21:33:10] <+afcgoonerbruh> As an overall mid , vieira is better. As a defensive mid only, its close
[2022-12-08 21:33:10] <%+ColeTrain3> sounds mad that u have viera nd hes stuck with paulinha
[2022-12-08 21:33:12] <etcjack> there's nothing better than Vieira from swaps because those gamble packs are 90% of the time rubbish LUL
[2022-12-08 21:33:16] <+salathebeat4> hows thiago? worth 300k?
[2022-12-08 21:33:17] <+rossigeorge7> How's Ljungberg?
[2022-12-08 21:33:17] <%+imbakaran> Nep he's suffering from Grapes are sour
[2022-12-08 21:33:18] <callumalc7> icon essence
[2022-12-08 21:33:19] <+ZaidFreestyle> vieira so clear
[2022-12-08 21:33:19] <freysi123> and sentimental value
[2022-12-08 21:33:19] <aeebee21> If i chose the 84x20 x3 initially is there enough tokens to then go for Viera?
[2022-12-08 21:33:19] <%$istreet98> dont have the time for Viera myself
[2022-12-08 21:33:20] <Brawnaldo> icon ghost stats confirmed
[2022-12-08 21:33:20] <+tomarnold27> Its just the time aspect for vieira i feel, like he is always insane but its a lot of time to put in for him
[2022-12-08 21:33:20] <FrancoJavierM> Vieira also has the hidden Icon trait
[2022-12-08 21:33:22] <+xVENOMx313x> He has that x factor
[2022-12-08 21:33:23] <imadnl> vieira is by far better these people cant just take the fact they did the 84x packs etc and didnt get shit from it
[2022-12-08 21:33:23] <+fistyanan> Hi nep just finished work. What was the 6pm content today? Anything to be happy about?
[2022-12-08 21:33:23] <luke123895> compare him to fabinho
[2022-12-08 21:33:24] <+phr3shajayy> Vieira is the vacuum
[2022-12-08 21:33:25] <%+robertovidal46> And playing with your favorite players makes always more fun…
[2022-12-08 21:33:28] <%mannyn90> vieira has the icon sticky about him too every ball in his area is intercepted with his spider legs
[2022-12-08 21:33:28] <+1stform> Yeah I have palhinha he’s good but could never be a viera
[2022-12-08 21:33:31] <+sterlinggoldstein> Icons stats lie too they always play better in game
[2022-12-08 21:33:32] <@Calzuhgg> There's certain players that just have something different about them, Renato for example
[2022-12-08 21:33:33] <+Jezrien___> @ifbbsami it’s the same people saying Bruno G is gonna be the best kid in the game…. You could give him 500 stats and 5/5 and it’s still a mid card actually in game
[2022-12-08 21:33:35] <%$istreet98> shame 90% of token were 6 golden goals
[2022-12-08 21:33:35] <$ayyfergy> guess its really preference for those who are against vieira
[2022-12-08 21:33:36] <ifbbsami> Viera is different
[2022-12-08 21:33:39] <willshire232323> Hero’s are the same this year, they are just different to other cards
[2022-12-08 21:33:41] <here4rewards_> there's reasons as to why Vieira is used in pro teams
[2022-12-08 21:33:41] <%H0NKTV> you used 95 pele, do you think he's any good? got him in the icon SBC but feel 92 mbappe is much better
[2022-12-08 21:33:47] <tbreezy111> are you going to do POTM eredivisie?
[2022-12-08 21:33:48] <+ZaidFreestyle> would u play vieira at cb if u had WC hero yaya
[2022-12-08 21:33:50] <%+kaigoddard19> neppo99 neppo99
[2022-12-08 21:33:51] <+imythias> its like comparing someone statistically to guillt whenever in game no one is anywhere near
[2022-12-08 21:33:55] <JimmyTheBits> You see Vieira on the opponents team and you play differently.
[2022-12-08 21:33:56] <yo_pieerree> Someone on tik tok was Tryna compare bergwin and wc cryuff
[2022-12-08 21:33:57] <kingRahman11> i love ur cb duo.
[2022-12-08 21:33:58] <%tja_100> maybe anchor on thiago
[2022-12-08 21:34:01] <d1_biggest_fan> zakaria clear
[2022-12-08 21:34:01] <gdeacon1> have u used OTW sanches nep?
[2022-12-08 21:34:01] <$Cedsam_88> Imagine getting a FREE Vieira, ANY version and not choosing it
[2022-12-08 21:34:01] <+saintjimmy1122> Is it just me or does work rates not matter that much this year?
[2022-12-08 21:34:14] <freysi123> what you think of Fabinho swaps?
[2022-12-08 21:34:16] <+MR_M4JOR> would u keep kuyt or thiago if u could have one in the team boss ?
[2022-12-08 21:34:17] <imadnl> ribery or world cup hero kewel ? who do you think is better @NepentheZ
[2022-12-08 21:34:24] <$ayyfergy> ribery
[2022-12-08 21:34:26] <%+normansrangers> whats ur tactics for this teams?
[2022-12-08 21:34:31] <TreWinz22> Shearer aint got no iconesc
[2022-12-08 21:34:32] <etcjack> do you think they'll release the remaining 8 tokens?
[2022-12-08 21:34:33] <+imythias> ribery
[2022-12-08 21:34:34] <+Jezrien___> @saintjimmy1122 so long as you give them custom insurrections
[2022-12-08 21:34:43] <ahmad23zdt> do we know who is the Portuguese ST on the loading screen??
[2022-12-08 21:34:43] <Brawnaldo> how many WC cards have you collected?
[2022-12-08 21:34:45] <Sammystaa> I have kuyt he's slow
[2022-12-08 21:34:46] <Rico696969> Dont you find marquez too slow ig?!@nep
[2022-12-08 21:34:46] <willshire232323> Do you think the new Jude coming tomorrow will be better than vieira?
[2022-12-08 21:34:48] <$fifatubetr> what are you going to do with that gnabry ?
[2022-12-08 21:34:49] <%+Conormcgovern> funny thing is, its an average team in this fifa, cause everyone has god sqauds
[2022-12-08 21:34:51] <+fut22beta> Camera zoom n height?
[2022-12-08 21:35:03] <+MR_M4JOR> ive not used thiago so im curious kuyt is very good imo but the stats on thiago look good
[2022-12-08 21:35:05] <+xVENOMx313x> Viera has a clutch trait or something he is just insane
[2022-12-08 21:35:08] <+tjb1492> @cedsam_88 time isn’t free brother
[2022-12-08 21:35:10] <+SuzuyaFPS> people like you asked for this gameplay?
[2022-12-08 21:35:28] <anipani93> Guys i’m using Di Natale but i don’t like him. Any ST suggestions to replace him around 400k ?
[2022-12-08 21:35:33] <+1stform> I think you meant 20 height 0 zoom you said it the other way around
[2022-12-08 21:35:33] <anipani93> Cheers nep 👍🏻

[2022-12-08 21:43:22] <%+abueladechicharito> in fifa 18 they gave special cards to the entire french team when they won the WC, would be cool if they did that this year, but doubt
[2022-12-08 21:43:24] <%+paulmc93> won't get my hopes up though

[2022-12-08 21:43:54] <thenerd9777> U opened your DR rewards?
[2022-12-08 21:44:06] <%$istreet98> Like when we figured out special cards weren't effected by chem. golden era of FUT
[2022-12-08 21:44:27] <+xVENOMx313x> The amount of different teams we would see as well would  be so cool
[2022-12-08 21:44:28] <%+killa_mole> wish they had a rare sbc that would allow unto change one player to a new position, have a few lw/lm that would love to have on my team
[2022-12-08 21:44:29] <%+normansrangers> start acuna lm and swap in game for capdevila?
[2022-12-08 21:44:30] <%+imbakaran> anybody know who the Dortmund CDM is?

[2022-12-08 21:44:40] <nolomorena13> Why cant i play rivals ?  or any other game mode ? u've been searching for almost 30min no opponents found
[2022-12-08 21:44:43] <willshire232323> It’s annoying that certain players are locked to 1 position. At least last year everyone could have at least 2 positions
[2022-12-08 21:44:46] <%+smithster343> Can Nunez play on the left
[2022-12-08 21:44:50] <thenerd9777> nation suck
[2022-12-08 21:44:52] <+afcgoonerbruh> Go to 4-2-4 and then you can look at RWs aswell snd move Freddie back over to the left
[2022-12-08 21:45:19] <%chrisdepot> The creativity of team making would be amazing if chemistry was gone
[2022-12-08 21:45:49] <+HossamEnaba1> Wasn’t Acuna 5 star skills in like FIFA 19??

[2022-12-08 21:47:14] <%chrisdepot> Chemistry limits team creativity it’s sad
[2022-12-08 21:47:23] <+superflyamf> Giroud was awful had to switch back to dzeko
[2022-12-08 21:47:23] <+HossamEnaba1> Only one club in London has a UCL trophy up the chels
