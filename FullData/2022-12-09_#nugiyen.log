[2022-12-09 13:37:31] <Phara_Darr> Well we are lucky that there is PoE and eventually PoE2, so if D4 is bad then nothing i lost and if it turns out to be good, well great more competition. But I think D4 is going the route of the casual gamer a bit too much
[2022-12-09 13:37:33] <+razzor1> @nugiyen did you already see that occultist ascendant notable still has the curse effectiveness? could be quite itneresting

[2022-12-09 13:38:20] <porcimea> hello mister streamer :). Nugi can you tell me please if ovelay leveling  is allowed. Overaly leveling it is like an wow addon that shows how to pass campaign
[2022-12-09 13:38:20] <@%XaiTV> they never cease to amaze me
[2022-12-09 13:38:21] <tatiantel7> does anyone has optical drive still
[2022-12-09 13:38:23] <Shad0w_93> that's just insane
[2022-12-09 13:38:24] <Recyclopz> I've seen some dumb stuff when it comes to preordering, but this is next level dog water.
[2022-12-09 13:38:29] <@EluminatorTV> i just want to collect. not gonna play 3Head
[2022-12-09 13:38:29] <%ampdecay> actual greed
[2022-12-09 13:38:31] <nemesea66> so how many red flags do we raise for the fact the battle pass progresses faster when you pre-order
[2022-12-09 13:38:32] <Covasertv> sounds like blizzard type company

[2022-12-09 13:39:03] <+JustThinkPink> That access model is fine with me if they therefore make sure their servers hold. Remember error 37?
[2022-12-09 13:39:03] <tatari_> My relationship with this game is like a rollercoaster
[2022-12-09 13:39:04] <@EluminatorTV> if it was any other company ... giving money to blizzard feels so wrong
[2022-12-09 13:39:06] <+WackaNerd> immortal D3 phone game they cover up D3 with overlay they learned from D2R
[2022-12-09 13:39:06] <+borg77_> I have no plans of playing it
[2022-12-09 13:39:07] <+Bearded__Wonder> i dont think thats true at all their site to preorder has the game losted on all 3 version so isk where people got that from
[2022-12-09 13:39:10] <+Lianxuki> I live on Brazil here the game is like 4x the price off a AAA game sold here
[2022-12-09 13:39:10] <Jokerthepoke> who is this boy :D
[2022-12-09 13:39:16] <@EluminatorTV> i wanna support the devs and not the management who is still in charge SadgeSitSip
[2022-12-09 13:39:16] <%Tolker> I have 0 hype for D4
[2022-12-09 13:39:20] <Wannabe_DJ> @EluminatorTV Well, Diablo lore is still cool even though the games may be shit. LUL
[2022-12-09 13:39:20] <Phara_Darr> I think I will watch it on twitch for the story and if people still play it after 6 months, I might get it
[2022-12-09 13:39:20] <@%XaiTV> 70 euro games was gonna be the standard for a while now, sucks but that's not even the worst part LOLW

[2022-12-09 13:39:44] <xPoEx> I am putting my faith one last time into Blizzard lol ... I am just too die hard Diablo to not at least try it
[2022-12-09 13:39:46] <heltvild> 70 euro for arpg entry price is a lot

[2022-12-09 13:40:03] <2slow4gaming> Important questions before leagure start: did they fix the pitiful amount of loot from maps?
[2022-12-09 13:40:04] <tatiantel7> it's that expensive because the game is that much more quality and content than other games

[2022-12-09 13:40:09] <Hillgrove> any twitch wizards here? (lesser will do I think).  I was told it was possible to do !commands on non-current streams (need the lootfilter command from Pohx) but I have no idea how to do it.. I don't get a chat window
[2022-12-09 13:40:09] <Cosbert> I love Diablo, but i'm not bothering with Diablo 4 and its Box Price, Battle pass, and MTX store monetization. I'd be okay with the Pass and Store if it was free, but cmon Blizzard.
[2022-12-09 13:40:09] <xPoEx> I started gaming with UO and Diablo, so its hard for me to not try it lol
[2022-12-09 13:40:09] <globalpotato123> if they have some battle pass bullshit on top its gonna be 100e for basic stuff lol
[2022-12-09 13:40:10] <Coolra1n> compare to a free to play as poe, you guys think poe 2 will align with diablo 4 release date? @chat

[2022-12-09 13:53:53] <Phara_Darr> I don't think that the average PoE player is the target group for D4. D4 is for the casual gamer made so they can reach the largest target group

[2022-12-09 13:55:07] <+rbsc0> too slow for me
[2022-12-09 13:55:08] <XinLao> @j0zsef surely more boring then poe act leveling right? since this is also in the beggining of the game and you're hoping to see everything in endgame now?

[2022-12-09 13:56:10] <+devildriv3n> @Kazzle23 maybe you would like lost ark then, it looks the same
[2022-12-09 13:56:11] <+nat33> i like LE speed
[2022-12-09 13:56:14] <HosehMao> poll
[2022-12-09 13:56:15] <+TuneSC> prove it
[2022-12-09 13:56:15] <RVerite> You can play PoE slowly. QUON plays PoE like that, invests in defenses and beats rare monsters in a minute or so.
[2022-12-09 13:56:20] <see_my_orb> where did you get that 90%? :)
[2022-12-09 13:56:22] <AcerMan88> some of the previewers said the monsters feel quite spungy, but I agree the slower pace is nice
[2022-12-09 13:56:27] <HawkBlade94> imagine haveing damage numbers in PoE
[2022-12-09 13:56:30] <+borg77_> I prefer the speed in Last Epoch
[2022-12-09 13:56:30] <coolfoolboo> i dont want anything to remind me of d3
[2022-12-09 13:56:32] <+Slaughtorhouse> D4 will suffer the same as D3. I don't think they know how to balance builds or make items a challenge to get
[2022-12-09 13:56:40] <dryodabba> Madge my game is the only game. Play it and have fun.
[2022-12-09 13:56:41] <%Cloudladder> Last Epoch has the best pacing by far
[2022-12-09 13:56:41] <sushimango> @xdellort YEP people are blind
[2022-12-09 13:56:41] <%+badix0309> the problem with playing at this pace in poe is you will not be efficient
[2022-12-09 13:56:43] <Kazzle23> @devildriv3n nah i hate lost ark, the character building and story setting sucks ass
[2022-12-09 13:56:46] <orange_power> yea this is like story campaign speed, no way you are going to be zooming from the get go
[2022-12-09 13:56:47] <xnenexx> yo nugi what up how are you ?
[2022-12-09 13:56:57] <Kuraharo2> biggest downfall of d4 is that it looks way too much like a copy of d3
[2022-12-09 13:56:59] <TokyoLovesYou> says lvl40
[2022-12-09 13:57:01] <%ampdecay> i like the color of the mana globe
[2022-12-09 13:57:02] <%Oobidoob> i really hope there are some good end game challenges that aren't just greater rift style things
[2022-12-09 13:57:05] <sushimango> it's AT MOST D3.5
[2022-12-09 13:57:07] <@oxblood_> if the combat is buttery smooth, it will mitigate some of the lack of item depth (as with d3). It's already a sound eargasm
[2022-12-09 13:57:09] <%Cloudladder> i loved early release d3 Sadge
[2022-12-09 13:57:11] <%ampdecay> space bar looks like run/walk toggle
[2022-12-09 13:57:13] <Phara_Darr> All this is fine but I am scared about the lack of stats for items. I think this will make it boring quick compared to PoE
[2022-12-09 13:57:15] <@%XaiTV> PoE trailers are also slow af
[2022-12-09 13:57:16] <%ampdecay> maybe sprint?
[2022-12-09 13:57:20] <AssistVS> game moves much faster in the later levels, judging it off this is like judging poe off a quin build
[2022-12-09 13:57:22] <kalik0> I want to have dmg numbers in poe
[2022-12-09 13:57:23] <jagr84> is this randomly generated do we know?
[2022-12-09 13:57:23] <coolfoolboo> i like d3, but i want d4 to be a completely new experience

[2022-12-09 13:57:39] <sushimango> slow is better tho YEP
[2022-12-09 13:57:39] <XinLao> man i wonder, what would i like most, this kind of combat more entertaining early in the game already or poe act's with overtuned crap to make you slow down on purpose with no engaging mechanics. and this is coming from someone playing poe for the last 4 years
[2022-12-09 13:57:41] <AcerMan88> the char is lvl 40

[2022-12-09 14:01:03] <Kuraharo2> is this valid criticism? I dislike the game already because they make it look like updated version of d3 and it brings back too many shit memories, they should have rather taken elements from d2 (like items for example). Also if the game wont have trade its gonna be shit
[2022-12-09 14:01:03] <sushimango> @EluminatorTV then it will be DOA for non-casuals

[2022-12-09 14:01:53] <shimagun__> does it look good ?
[2022-12-09 14:01:53] <Coolra1n> Datmodz said the same the game was harder than he expected positioning matter for surviving
[2022-12-09 14:01:54] <+Glonix16> skills looked boring tbh @nugiyen

[2022-12-09 14:01:59] <+BigFutaCoc> @EluminatorTV just the ip sells no matter how bad it is, look at immortal for example YEP

[2022-12-09 14:02:03] <+Kassabae> I just hate the way tthe ui at the bottom looks everything else is fine
[2022-12-09 14:02:05] <%+MrVonDutchman> how they handle p2w etc will be the most important factor though
[2022-12-09 14:02:05] <+texugoland> the only thing that botters me is the "twigs"
[2022-12-09 14:02:07] <sushimango> the text on the enemies looks like a chinese arpg
[2022-12-09 14:02:09] <Tnb87113> Tags are super readable I like that
[2022-12-09 14:02:12] <+coupe_68> ngl.. i was hoping it would be dogshit.. but it looks great
[2022-12-09 14:02:12] <ADawgarian> the camera angle looks weird
[2022-12-09 14:02:19] <anoubis13> the gameplay is just too slow it makes it look like your typical mobile game
[2022-12-09 14:02:20] <Fictitious1267> GGG can learn what icons are good for
[2022-12-09 14:02:22] <%KVahlman> Imagine not hating D4 to stroke haters in chat WeirdCoffee
[2022-12-09 14:02:26] <sushimango> COPIUM
[2022-12-09 14:02:26] <GOLEM_DI_CATRAME> Just look at the POE 2 video from a year ago and try to compare it
[2022-12-09 14:02:30] <+JakeParkbench> @Dadscope Its like d3 with the unlocked skill selection turned on. So you can run any of your skills in any slot
[2022-12-09 14:02:32] <playstationboy11> text looks too clean, like a word text @sushimango ye
[2022-12-09 14:02:35] <Amirul85> what turn me off is that the gameplay looks a lot like d3. I was hoping it will much more similar to d2. they did  say they were based it on d3. progression of d2 and the eerie feeling of d1.
[2022-12-09 14:02:38] <%Cloudladder> the itemization is the make or break
[2022-12-09 14:02:40] <coolfoolboo> in the end, its all about the gear progression. they better get that right
[2022-12-09 14:02:40] <!McDumb> KVahlman too many poe frogs in here, take cover monkaH
[2022-12-09 14:02:44] <%+MrVonDutchman> @nugiyen is there any info about a potential grim dawn 2?
[2022-12-09 14:02:45] <AntiFusion> pepeW
[2022-12-09 14:02:48] <Phara_Darr> I am just looking forward when everyone buys the more expensive box for 4 days head start and then the server are dieing anyway and everyone is demanding compensation KEKW
[2022-12-09 14:02:49] <+BigFutaCoc> this game could be hot garbage like immortal and people still gonna buy it because its diablo lacOMEGA
[2022-12-09 14:02:51] <+borg77_> Blizzard games always look good but have no long time playability in my opinion
[2022-12-09 14:02:52] <EomNy> PauseChamp
[2022-12-09 14:02:53] <%TheLauron> the itemization leaves a bit to be desired as far as we can see for now, but everything else looks solid
[2022-12-09 14:02:55] <%TheLauron> price is mad sus
[2022-12-09 14:02:58] <TheGargalon> I just installed my 4090 and can definitely recommend, game runs on 100 fps finally
[2022-12-09 14:03:01] <Kazzle23> the tree with only two choices per skill is kinda sad, but gameplay looks great
[2022-12-09 14:03:04] <sushimango> I really want D4 to be good, but with each reveal it's just more disappointment Sadge
[2022-12-09 14:03:13] <playstationboy11> buying D4 in 2022/2023 LUL MAO cmon boys, poe2 all the way
[2022-12-09 14:03:19] <scatterrrbrain> I kinda hate that they use decimal points in come of the stats

[2022-12-09 14:04:49] <%Cloudladder> blizzard & sketchy monetization, name a better couple
[2022-12-09 14:04:54] <+ArcadiusXIV> Monitization is going to be like 40-50% of what immortal is and some ppeople are going to praise them for it
[2022-12-09 14:04:56] <+kevingg141> scuffed isnt the word i'd choose
[2022-12-09 14:04:58] <Shad0w_93> blizzard is just too greedy nowadays
[2022-12-09 14:04:59] <MadnessHype> does monetization matter? cuz it has nothing to do with the game progression, so if you don't, you just don't need to spend a single penny
[2022-12-09 14:05:00] <magnum555_> @hashinshin_dont_ban_me 6h

[2022-12-09 14:05:09] <Veelq> no bots is a problem of more than one mmo KEKW
[2022-12-09 14:05:11] <poedelve21> how will d4 handle bots, that will be interesting

[2022-12-09 14:05:14] <jeanlamise> and no pheons
[2022-12-09 14:05:15] <coolfoolboo> @madnesshype, it matters if its p2w
[2022-12-09 14:05:29] <+JustThinkPink> I mean Diablo 2 was a game one played for 10k hours so you expect the predecessor to be the same
[2022-12-09 14:05:30] <+Slaughtorhouse> I think lost ark boss battles are the  most fun combat of all arpgs. But hate the game
[2022-12-09 14:05:33] VIEWERS: 1¬†395
[2022-12-09 14:05:35] <coolfoolboo> cos everyone is on the same playing field, and no one likes it if someone can just pay to progress faster
[2022-12-09 14:05:37] <garbaroki> bots paying 60-80 euro for d4?!
[2022-12-09 14:05:39] <orange_power> pheons are only bad cause of rmt/bots inflating prices
[2022-12-09 14:05:39] <MadnessHype> I just don't understand people blaming non-P2W monetization model for moral/ethical reasons lol
[2022-12-09 14:05:39] <%+badix0309> No bots and no ingame microtransaction is the play

[2022-12-09 14:05:51] <hoodidupeh> well you pay more pheons depending how much other people spend their real money, it is kinda bad
[2022-12-09 14:05:51] <jeanlamise> pheons are here 5o avoid bots
[2022-12-09 14:05:53] <%Cloudladder> @garbaroki of course, they get more money out of it than they spend
[2022-12-09 14:05:58] <AssistVS> yall spend $1500+ on a computer to play games and scurry in fear cause of a $70 game
[2022-12-09 14:06:02] <+borg77_> To me interesting items and unikes is the most important in a arpg's And blizzard have told ud that it is not going to happen in D¬§
[2022-12-09 14:06:05] <poedelve21> lol d4 wont cost for ever 70
[2022-12-09 14:06:12] <inuboshi> @zaQon costs half of a minimum wage here LuL
[2022-12-09 14:06:20] <MightyG__> @Coolra1n thats the most annoying xD
[2022-12-09 14:06:21] <+kevingg141> AND battle passes
[2022-12-09 14:06:21] <xdellort> and exp boosts
[2022-12-09 14:06:22] <+Arakki> and a collector's edition with no game in it
[2022-12-09 14:06:24] <Í∞ÄÍªòÎØ∏Ïïº1204 (jtyjty1204)> anyway ux design not good than other stuff in d4
[2022-12-09 14:06:24] <heltvild> and a battle pass
[2022-12-09 14:06:24] <garbaroki> it can be preordered in my country for 60 euro..
[2022-12-09 14:06:26] <%TheLauron> and battle pass
[2022-12-09 14:06:26] <@EluminatorTV> it will
[2022-12-09 14:06:26] <scatterrrbrain> pepeLaugh
[2022-12-09 14:06:31] <coolfoolboo> @bigfutacoc hopefully not. not that i cant pay, but it just makes the game very fake and not competitive
[2022-12-09 14:06:33] <%Oobidoob> it's bllizzard they will not lower the price
[2022-12-09 14:06:34] <+lazorlarz> Expensive game, In-game store, Battlepass. monkaS
[2022-12-09 14:06:35] <EIoen> @nat33 Doesn't change the fact that you get to choose from more heroes by paying money pepeLaugh Good on them tho
[2022-12-09 14:06:37] <TheElvenborn> and a battle pass docLeave
[2022-12-09 14:06:38] <Swageroni_> I aint buying a p2w game lol
[2022-12-09 14:06:41] <Phara_Darr> The thing is normally paying this much for a top quality ARPG would be no problem because you will usually get your worth out of it, the problem is blizzards track record of recent
[2022-12-09 14:06:41] <orange_power> xdd just play poe2 if u dont want to spend money on D4
[2022-12-09 14:06:41] <+Slaughtorhouse> so will POE2 prob
[2022-12-09 14:06:41] <Treviousius> exp boost has been clarified to only be for the seasonal pass xp
[2022-12-09 14:06:41] <+kevingg141> not probably. will have a battle pass
[2022-12-09 14:06:45] <scatterrrbrain> It'll cost more than 70 later LOLW
[2022-12-09 14:06:47] <heltvild> battleplass is already confirmed
[2022-12-09 14:06:48] <+unsavorydeath> They have already announced all of that stuff is in the game

[2022-12-09 14:06:51] <@EluminatorTV> @nugiyen what do you think about 30 minutes elixier that give a 3% xp boost?
[2022-12-09 14:06:51] <%+Digitking> It's Blizzard Activision... of course the monetization will be over the top
[2022-12-09 14:06:52] <van_tonder> Why does every fucking game need a Battle Pass nowadays Sadge
[2022-12-09 14:06:54] <EomNy> d4 p2w? monkaHmm

[2022-12-09 14:06:58] <+ShandsS> They have said multiple times no p2w
[2022-12-09 14:06:59] <derivative12> if it's p2w like lost arc that'll be so sad
[2022-12-09 14:07:00] <xdellort> $5 per town portal
[2022-12-09 14:07:01] <Snatat> To me this game seems like a cash grab.

[2022-12-09 14:07:09] <ruby_dev> start 4 days early if u preorder @nugiyen
[2022-12-09 14:07:09] <Kuraharo2> @AssistVS i agree with you, but thats a bad comparison. There are no shops handing out PCs for free but theres plenty GOOD free games
[2022-12-09 14:07:09] <+Theagent203> @nugiyen if you buy the 100bucks version you get 20lvls for free with the battlepass lookup on the battlenet store
[2022-12-09 14:07:10] <Molvic> make a server without battlepass - see if players would join with/out

[2022-12-09 14:07:16] <OatmanTV> also pay for early access
[2022-12-09 14:07:17] <AcerMan88> battlepass is only mtx though
[2022-12-09 14:07:18] <+kevingg141> they have XP boost in the battle pass. if you can purchase levels then it is P2W....
[2022-12-09 14:07:20] <%TUROK__> D4 having renown system like WoW as well btw

[2022-12-09 14:07:42] <%Cloudladder> @nugiyen they said cosmetics only(not that it means much, coming from them) on the battle pass
[2022-12-09 14:07:45] <coolfoolboo> im ok with pay money for cosmetics
[2022-12-09 14:07:50] <Kaplanx5> quin pepeLaugh
[2022-12-09 14:07:51] <MadnessHype> we need something better than BattlePass.. Blizzard trying to ride on the BattlePass at this late phase seems to be a ridiculous decision

[2022-12-09 14:07:52] <+BigFutaCoc> @coolfoolboo i'm on the same hopium i played 4k hours of d3 because had real nice and smoth gameplay for his time in comparison to any other competitor
[2022-12-09 14:07:52] <coolfoolboo> and ill do so
[2022-12-09 14:07:52] <EIoen> @nat33 How many people reached these levels f2p? I'd be surprised if it's more than a handful. I am f2p myself cause I can't be bothered paying Blizzard money for that
[2022-12-09 14:07:55] <+GentlemanJack_> im pretty sure blizzard will even make a only fans account with cosplay girls from d4
[2022-12-09 14:07:57] <Treviousius> @kevingg141 its not player xp its seasonal pass xp
[2022-12-09 14:08:03] <MightyG__> lost ark not even dat greedy , Amazon gaming just fkn insanely uncompitent
[2022-12-09 14:08:03] <+Broder_Ole> Is the game bought and has ultra-monetization?
[2022-12-09 14:08:04] <subvertthis> prob is not 70 bucks tho, its 70 plus ingame shop plus Battlepass PLUS Expansions ( 40 bucks or more eeach )
[2022-12-09 14:08:05] <Equandor> +10 main stat cosmetic pepeLaugh
[2022-12-09 14:08:06] <+Slaughtorhouse> they should have just made a tv show
[2022-12-09 14:08:06] <EomNy> any music? modCheck
[2022-12-09 14:08:06] <%TUROK__> im concerned about renown system, don't want to feel pressured to do things
[2022-12-09 14:08:07] <@EluminatorTV> @nugiyen what do you think about the gathering and elixier crafting and those things in d4?
[2022-12-09 14:08:07] <garbaroki> @badix0309 very good game
[2022-12-09 14:08:07] <h34dstr0ng> Yeah, I am not buying games until I see it anymore
[2022-12-09 14:08:08] <aenyth1> wait, it's 70 dollars?
[2022-12-09 14:08:08] <+lillillyfox> Just tuned in. Is there ingame p2w?
[2022-12-09 14:08:11] <magnum555_> @nugiyen Do you know whats most fucked thing about the 4 day headstart? Its that they on purpose made game release on MONDAY so that if u buy headstart you have all weekend to play. Literally scumbag move
[2022-12-09 14:08:16] <crowed_07> is this game of ARPG genre gonna worth $70 ? whats ur take @nugiyen
[2022-12-09 14:08:18] <+eternel_21> the 4 day head start for the peaple wo pay for the more expensive box is the nail in the coffin for me
[2022-12-09 14:08:23] <+FrankTizzle> @GentlemanJack_ sign me up BOOBA
[2022-12-09 14:08:24] <nemesea66> @nugiyen battle pass progression is quicker when you pre-order gogogo
[2022-12-09 14:08:31] <+nat33> @EIoen its more about skill than p2w or f2p, i payed and im like 7k only and i was top 50 BGs before :)
[2022-12-09 14:08:32] <+Slaughtorhouse> It won't be better than d3
[2022-12-09 14:08:40] <Phara_Darr> 4 day headstart is not a big deal, server will be offline most of the time anyway
[2022-12-09 14:08:43] <+kevingg141> @Treviousius you sure? in a previous post they had said there will be boosts. i'll try to find it
[2022-12-09 14:08:44] <Tnb87113> Imagine being F2P with super minimal controversy over your microtransactions for a decade
[2022-12-09 14:08:46] <xdellort> well its a very low bar
[2022-12-09 14:08:48] <Treviousius> yes @kevingg141
[2022-12-09 14:08:52] <subvertthis> it will be better than D3 because it is uses the D3 base
[2022-12-09 14:08:52] <garbaroki> if d4 is very similar to d3 will fail badly
[2022-12-09 14:08:52] <Í∞ÄÍªòÎØ∏Ïïº1204 (jtyjty1204)> d3 anime ?lol
[2022-12-09 14:08:55] <+nameisalreadygone> I mainly hope they have skilltrees again and not switchable runes
[2022-12-09 14:08:55] <+borg77_> D3 is shit to in my book
[2022-12-09 14:08:56] <+Slaughtorhouse> i played it, it's very similar lol
[2022-12-09 14:09:01] <Amirul85> definitely better than d3
[2022-12-09 14:09:02] <%+FraGDenShizOo> i do not buy it for 70 without seeing the full endgame first
[2022-12-09 14:09:03] <Boniukas> d3 remastered for 70 bucks, classic blizzard
[2022-12-09 14:09:04] <Í∞ÄÍªòÎØ∏Ïïº1204 (jtyjty1204)> d4 is better than d3
[2022-12-09 14:09:07] <+todopodre> ppl love to hate these days NotLikeDuck
[2022-12-09 14:09:08] <Veelq> it better has 3 passive trees, 2 in PoE is not enough for me Kappa
[2022-12-09 14:09:08] <+Dadscope> 70$ price point is dogshit
[2022-12-09 14:09:09] <xPoEx> I think D4 will attract players that enjoyed original Diablo and D2
[2022-12-09 14:09:10] <Kaplanx5> you have 1k? in d3? holy thats some endurace
[2022-12-09 14:09:11] <+TakeruKusanagi> What you expected its Diablo ppl get wet when they hear new D game coming
[2022-12-09 14:09:14] <ChigenTV> D3 2 days of fun - D4 1 week of fun
[2022-12-09 14:09:17] <+nubmaycry> i didnt spend that many hours in d3 but i too had good time
[2022-12-09 14:09:17] <Ahmose_> sometimes heavily marketed games fail at delivering
[2022-12-09 14:09:19] <binlouis> 70$ diablo 4 LUL
[2022-12-09 14:09:20] <+SallGood> the objectivity appreciated
[2022-12-09 14:09:24] <binlouis> OMEGALUL
[2022-12-09 14:09:25] <+borg77_> well I enjoyed it to for 500-1000 houers to I must say
[2022-12-09 14:09:25] <+SallGood> people forget that d3 was fun
[2022-12-09 14:09:32] <Kaplanx5> yeah but poe is actually fun to play LUL
[2022-12-09 14:09:33] <inuboshi> i spent about 3k hours on d3, from season 1 to season 20
[2022-12-09 14:09:34] VIEWERS: 1¬†470
[2022-12-09 14:09:36] <subvertthis> @xPoEx D4 is like D3 in therms of mechanic, saying it will attrack d2 players just because ¬®it is darker ¬®is pure marketing
[2022-12-09 14:09:36] <Veelq> j OMEGALUL b
[2022-12-09 14:09:36] <+gh0strunner0n3rd> d3 was pretty fun
[2022-12-09 14:09:38] <+Kernnun> PPL complaining about a game they pay 60 for and get 400++ hours of good times from. LUL
[2022-12-09 14:09:39] <garbaroki> i will not rush buying it will wait like 1-2 weeks
[2022-12-09 14:09:41] <@EluminatorTV> @nugiyen I am not a fan of the mmo askepcts they introduced to d4
[2022-12-09 14:09:43] <%+FraGDenShizOo> i have like 3k
[2022-12-09 14:09:43] <herveao> easier to amke 30k in poe than 1500, way easier
[2022-12-09 14:09:43] <+FrankTizzle> @ChigenTV d3 was like a month of fun at release
[2022-12-09 14:09:43] <+Slaughtorhouse> I think the game could do well if they keep up the balancing and content, but it will be for a different fan base than POE. Way more casual
[2022-12-09 14:09:44] <+nuble90> 30k hours?!?! wtf how
[2022-12-09 14:09:45] <crowed_07> is D4 as a ARPG genre gonna worth $70 ? whats ur take @nugiyen
[2022-12-09 14:09:47] <%+Gear88_fgc> can someone post the link
[2022-12-09 14:09:47] <Shihamut> d3 was fun, especially with friends
[2022-12-09 14:09:47] <Phara_Darr> first few seasons of D3 were good I for sure got my moneys  worth
[2022-12-09 14:09:51] <tarnar> itll def be a game to play for like a couple of weeks
[2022-12-09 14:09:51] <+gh0strunner0n3rd> d3 is still fun
[2022-12-09 14:09:53] <coolfoolboo> @bigfutacoc, hmm we have to see how it goes but ill certainly be playing d4, cos lets be real, we have been waiting a long time for it. but i just hope they dont have rare crafting materials that can be paid with money and more importantly, the best ite,ms should be account-bound. thats something d3 actually did right
[2022-12-09 14:09:54] <+A5L4N> D3 was ok until Season 4. then it went down hill imo
[2022-12-09 14:09:55] <magnum555_> @Phara_Darr it is. It literally shows its all for money. Even worse when you see they planned release on monday so that if u buy headstart you have all weekend to play. Literally scumbag move
[2022-12-09 14:09:55] <+eternel_21> @Phara_Darr but is a bad tast in the mouth the 2 have pay but one not enouth is realy bad .
[2022-12-09 14:09:56] <Kazzle23> d3 was soo much fun, until they ruined it with set bonuses
[2022-12-09 14:09:58] <%Cloudladder> d3 was super fun when playing with friends
[2022-12-09 14:09:58] <%+MrVonDutchman> @nugiyen you decided a league starter yet?
[2022-12-09 14:09:58] <binlouis> d3 still fun bruh
[2022-12-09 14:09:59] <Molvic> d3 - good gameplay - trash systems
[2022-12-09 14:10:00] <+OGniza> i played D3 vanilla and first 3 seasons like crazy
[2022-12-09 14:10:02] <+d1rtydeeds> d3 looked like a disney version of poe
[2022-12-09 14:10:07] <Geeezaa> yep I played d3 a LOT like a LOT specially seasons 15-20, but POE since 3.13
[2022-12-09 14:10:08] <subvertthis> an ARPG on release it is always fun
[2022-12-09 14:10:12] <+borg77_> But D3 newer evolved
[2022-12-09 14:10:12] <+nuble90> thats like 60 hours a week
[2022-12-09 14:10:13] <EIoen> @nat33 You gotta go and check out the meaning of p2w. But good on you!
[2022-12-09 14:10:17] <Sweasy_> D3 was fine until they buffed regen out of this world. Like in vanilla the campain was actually hard and nice to play.
[2022-12-09 14:10:18] <+Slaughtorhouse> I made $250 off a ring in d3 vanilla
[2022-12-09 14:10:19] <+Stratz> back in the day from vanilla to season 3 or 4 d3 was amazing
[2022-12-09 14:10:19] <Tnb87113> Same. Poe has been great over the e years
[2022-12-09 14:10:20] <parti82> d3 was ruined by the itemization and its forced set bonuses
[2022-12-09 14:10:26] <%stanzwar> oh Im here for Diabalooo
[2022-12-09 14:10:28] <+Scroll_Of_Wisdom> thats 3.4 years staight PoE
[2022-12-09 14:10:29] <varmkorven> actually exactly a decade for me, think i got in at this exact date
[2022-12-09 14:10:30] <+kevingg141> @Treviousius ok i got it wrong. there will be XP boosts in the battle pass but you cant unlock them quicker by paying
[2022-12-09 14:10:34] <%+Digitking> D3 gameplay was good, but it was so shallow
[2022-12-09 14:10:34] <@%Andrew756> but in a decade of 8 hours of poe DAILY there's only 29200 hours nugi
[2022-12-09 14:10:35] <tarnar> long term idk abt d4
[2022-12-09 14:10:36] <%stanzwar> good LOL
[2022-12-09 14:10:37] <+Scroll_Of_Wisdom> quick maths
[2022-12-09 14:10:39] <+Darkscatter> whats monetized?
[2022-12-09 14:10:40] <Molvic> @parti82 +1
[2022-12-09 14:10:43] <magnum555_> @nugiyen Game is realiing in monday. 4 day headstart means people will have full weekend to play. Dont tell me its not planned scum move so people feel like they need to buy it YEP
[2022-12-09 14:10:44] <Phara_Darr> yes for sure headstart is bad taste, and it will be the cause for the first drama after launch, because everyone will demand compensation for time missed because servers are dead
[2022-12-09 14:10:45] <Treviousius> @kevingg141 nod and its the free pass
[2022-12-09 14:10:46] <+OGniza> i remeber the insane manticore @nugiyen had in vanilla D3 farming act 3
[2022-12-09 14:10:50] <+nat33> @EIoen lol i, the meaning im just sayng that payng in BGs without skill not make u "win" anything LUL  Have nice day man :)
[2022-12-09 14:10:53] <hr77> no more money 4 blizz; poe/poe2 and Ashes of Creation ist all i need :) and have the time for...
[2022-12-09 14:10:54] <coolfoolboo> i like d3 too but its like a 1 week game KEKW
[2022-12-09 14:10:55] <xPoEx> @subvertthis Alot of what original diablo fans hated about D3 was the aesetics part of it, along with other stuff as well of course
[2022-12-09 14:11:02] <OatmanTV> my first poe char is 10 years in like 2 weeks alkXD
[2022-12-09 14:11:02] <+GentlemanJack_> im all for paying for nice of boobs, armor sets, explosive skill looks but if there will be any kind of pay to progress im out 1000%
[2022-12-09 14:11:03] <inuboshi> @Andrew756 8 hours is kinda low though
[2022-12-09 14:11:03] <subvertthis> @parti82 well we have a similar system in D4 xD its not set but it is gear improve
[2022-12-09 14:11:04] <garbaroki> poe creaters seem smarter than diablos

[2022-12-09 14:11:51] <subvertthis> @xPoEx no, we hated the bad mechanics that they made up that were nt like D2.  PoE drinks from D2. D4 is copying things from PoE but yet using D3 as a base
[2022-12-09 14:11:51] <+Draftingle> i just hope that they make a free open beta, i think i wont buy it otherwise
[2022-12-09 14:11:55] <magnum555_> So headstart will start friday

[2022-12-09 14:12:52] <magnum555_> It just shows how greedy they are
[2022-12-09 14:12:54] <+BigFutaCoc> it really sucks
[2022-12-09 14:12:55] <%Vosy1984> it also releases 6 months from now, and if GGG keep their 3 month schedule it will fall exactly in the same time frame @nugiyen
[2022-12-09 14:12:55] <Amirul85> I dont like the early access.
[2022-12-09 14:12:55] <!%Banaan_> what do we hate? i missed it FeelsWeirdMan
[2022-12-09 14:12:55] <+eternel_21> yes but lost ark is free to play and pay to early acces here is pay to not play and pay more to play early....
[2022-12-09 14:12:57] <Anger_LBow> just joined, what is the tldr on this?
[2022-12-09 14:13:01] <+Stratz> @XaiTV yep 100% true
[2022-12-09 14:13:01] <Fictitious1267> so, we need early-early access now LUL
[2022-12-09 14:13:04] <coolfoolboo> true. i think most ppl will buy early access version
[2022-12-09 14:13:05] <@%XaiTV> I might just wait a month to play it even if it looks good in case they pull a bait and switch
[2022-12-09 14:13:05] <inuboshi> you also get levels skip for battle pass
[2022-12-09 14:13:09] <Tnb87113> Why can‚Äôt blizz just sell the fucking franchise üò©üò©üò©
[2022-12-09 14:13:10] <+Bujoh> prolly not gonna buy at all and watch streamers first to decide if its worth buying
[2022-12-09 14:13:13] <+quizzlemanizzle> what I really dont like about D4 is the WoWification of it all
[2022-12-09 14:13:13] <imawizzardlol> do you guys not have wallets?
[2022-12-09 14:13:14] <Snatat> I've already made my decision. I am not playing Diablo 4
[2022-12-09 14:13:16] <+Belzariak> they also do the early access to spread out the players and make money at the same time.
[2022-12-09 14:13:17] <coolfoolboo> so it becomes normal access Kappa
[2022-12-09 14:13:17] <ReginaGuimaraes> @Anger_LBow blizzard being racist again
[2022-12-09 14:13:17] <@%Andrew756> earliest access when
[2022-12-09 14:13:18] <+Jaguar0808> D3 also released on a Tuesday
[2022-12-09 14:13:20] <subvertthis> @XaiTV as far as I know first season of D4 wont start 3-4 months later
[2022-12-09 14:13:21] <+Qured> wait for a sale YEP
[2022-12-09 14:13:21] <Phara_Darr> GGG is pulling out PoE2 for that date KEKW
[2022-12-09 14:13:22] <cazperdeluxe> Yeah not buying this one, blizz ICANT
[2022-12-09 14:13:23] <%+Shrimpanzie> @XaiTV thats my plan
[2022-12-09 14:13:25] <+davo3016yy> @XaiTV .. they are a company ... they want to make money ,,,, no real suprise
[2022-12-09 14:13:25] <+d1rtydeeds> i rather spend 60 on poe supporter packs
[2022-12-09 14:13:26] <garbaroki> @nugiyen people are syaing you are going back to LA LUL
[2022-12-09 14:13:26] <EIoen> @Anger_LBow Game looks interesting but it's Blizzard
[2022-12-09 14:13:26] <+A5L4N> @nugiyen Doesn't Accelerated seasonal battle pass unlock mean those that prepurchase will get the XP boosts quicker than those that dont?
[2022-12-09 14:13:27] <CMEPTOBETEP> @XaiTV isnt season not starting till later anyway so you not loosing anything
[2022-12-09 14:13:28] <@%Andrew756> i need to be the very first
[2022-12-09 14:13:29] <subvertthis> wont start until *
[2022-12-09 14:13:29] <%herxtheslayer> wow, I guess EA is like NOTED
[2022-12-09 14:13:29] <+ShandsS> Why is there paid early access if the game is already pay to play? KEKW
[2022-12-09 14:13:30] <+ultraTheBoomer> I think you only get the headstart if you buy the silver or gold packs no? the standard doesnt gives you headstart... just access to beta no?
[2022-12-09 14:13:31] <XmasMancer> @xaitv LUL sure you will
[2022-12-09 14:13:32] <TiggerKnowsBest> gg no re
[2022-12-09 14:13:34] <+kemisten> just release on a friday for everyone what's so hard about that
[2022-12-09 14:13:34] VIEWERS: 1¬†530
[2022-12-09 14:13:37] <aenyth1> yea, i wont preorder for sure, and probably wont buy it until a few days in , so i can see if its p2w like immortal or not. i dont trust them
[2022-12-09 14:13:39] <Shihamut> what a dogshit is Madge
[2022-12-09 14:13:39] <+BigFutaCoc> they doing it for the money and to not overburden the servers so it reduces the cost for them aswell
[2022-12-09 14:13:39] <Jinxul> not playing this bait for sure
[2022-12-09 14:13:39] <Anger_LBow> oh, nvm. Its about blizzard. I dont care about them. At all.
[2022-12-09 14:13:41] <@EluminatorTV> basically the "early access" is the normal release. and the normal release is the late access for "cheap" KEKLEO
[2022-12-09 14:13:43] <samsp00> blizzard are garbage
[2022-12-09 14:13:44] <%TUROK__> wait i think ppl in chat are misunderstanding, the game releases 6/6, beta is going to be way before release, they wouldn't release a beta 4 days prior to game release KEKW
[2022-12-09 14:13:45] <+quizzlemanizzle> I get the impression that D4 endgame is basically Mythic+.  Only variety hp/dmg scaling plus a couple of affixes
[2022-12-09 14:13:47] <scatterrrbrain> nowae
[2022-12-09 14:13:48] <@%XaiTV> @XmasMancer you underestimate my hatred of Blizzard games in the last 10 years LOLW

[2022-12-09 14:14:11] <krabba93> my eyes!
[2022-12-09 14:14:11] <WonkiWonkiWonki> I don't think GGG will drop PoE 2 to compete with Diablo 4, they lose that competition 10/10 times. They'll do what they did with Cyberpunk and wait for the hype to die down.

[2022-12-09 15:20:07] <!+Myth82> i havent played since they added the new bosses. i wanna play trap sabo either fire trap or ice trap in SC SSF? what should i pick?
[2022-12-09 15:20:13] <@%XaiTV> @ItsMeFuzz if you follow they show up ingame, I usually update them once the website comes back up
[2022-12-09 15:20:14] <rorshan> ItsMeFuzz following will put them in the list automatically
[2022-12-09 15:20:22] <+razzor1> poison pconc is also absolutely busted with new temp chain
[2022-12-09 15:20:23] <ItsMeFuzz> @XaiTV thank you kind sir
[2022-12-09 15:20:23] <SuprMeatDude> @Myth82 both are fine
[2022-12-09 15:20:24] <%Dying_Sun_> @hollowman2020 well yes, also depends on your build though, other modifiers also apply like generic "damage over time" "damage over time multi"  also work for poison
[2022-12-09 15:20:26] <%MrBonkeyDollax> Azzairen yes, set them up in parent league
[2022-12-09 15:20:28] <grizzlywood> Thank you

[2022-12-09 15:20:51] <moxlight> Myth82 both are good, i played explosive trap last league, also a good option
[2022-12-09 15:20:59] <hollowman2020> @dying_sun_ thanks.
[2022-12-09 15:21:00] <HawkBlade94> @nugiyen what is the weapon that makes you spend life instead of mana and it is not Hiltless
[2022-12-09 15:21:02] <Â£πÁôæÂÖÉ (one_hundo_)> don't those setting reset after the patching?

[2022-12-09 15:22:24] <+Scroll_Of_Wisdom> @Matigis you wanna learn through a guide?
[2022-12-09 15:22:24] <rorshan> i mean poison concoction is pretty much the strongest levelling skill so i guess a lot of people will use it at the start
[2022-12-09 15:22:27] <+Fhauny> what song playlist is this ?
[2022-12-09 15:22:32] <Matigis> @Scroll_Of_Wisdom sure

[2022-12-09 15:23:13] <@%XaiTV> curses are OP in updated PoB btw, it didn't update the gems just the boss curse effect
[2022-12-09 15:23:20] <@%XaiTV> so keep that in mind
[2022-12-09 15:23:27] <TwoBuckChuck_> PoB devs been busy
[2022-12-09 15:23:30] <hollowman2020> what's the proper way to roll your flask for pconc? reduced flask charges used or Gain a flask charges?
[2022-12-09 15:23:31] <jahkrispyy> Chat can poison bv occultist kill all bosses minus Ubers??
[2022-12-09 15:23:31] <h34dstr0ng> nugiBlind
[2022-12-09 15:23:37] <!%Banaan_> thats why occultist was doing so much damage LUL
[2022-12-09 15:23:42] <rorshan> the gems area always updated from the binaries after release, it's expected

[2022-12-09 15:24:03] <h34dstr0ng> and that Effect of Curses cluster is there!
[2022-12-09 15:24:08] <+reflexzRRR> are exalteds back or are divines still the "main" currency?
[2022-12-09 15:24:11] <mateuszz_> lvl 99build :(
[2022-12-09 15:24:16] <rorshan> hollowman2020 neither, all you care about is making the amount bigger
[2022-12-09 15:24:16] <%TheLauron> how will you be applying the curses btw?
[2022-12-09 15:24:21] <SuprMeatDude> @nugiyen are you using blasphemy or no?
[2022-12-09 15:24:41] <h34dstr0ng> Did you take Steeped in the Profane cluster?
[2022-12-09 15:24:44] <@%XaiTV> gems didn't update
[2022-12-09 15:24:48] <@%XaiTV> only the calcs/tree
[2022-12-09 15:24:50] <!%Banaan_> What league are you playing this league @nugiyen ? ssfhc?
[2022-12-09 15:24:51] <hollowman2020> @rorshan you do need flask sustain though.
[2022-12-09 15:24:56] <$Vernash_> having less curse effect on a 35% aura is so blegh, whyyyyyy
[2022-12-09 15:24:58] <engravingfin> gg league start... tried to catch drone while drunk and almost got my fingers chopped off
[2022-12-09 15:25:14] <rorshan> hollowman2020 yeah, but I'd say the flasks themselves isn't the place to do that
[2022-12-09 15:25:15] <engravingfin> no flask piano for me
[2022-12-09 15:25:35] <%MrBonkeyDollax> @engravingfin play PF YEP
[2022-12-09 15:25:40] <ionxeno> melee will take less resolve damage . . .how does that work with range . . will you also take less damage if you bridge the gap and go melee range with a range char?
[2022-12-09 15:25:42] <h34dstr0ng> @Vernash_ because it is a lazy way to apply it, so it has a penalty
[2022-12-09 15:25:46] <engravingfin> left hand so gg

[2022-12-09 15:25:59] <HawkBlade94> @nugiyen would it be too big buff if blasphemy was 25% mana reservation instead of 35%
[2022-12-09 15:26:01] <rorshan> ionxeno yes
[2022-12-09 15:26:18] <ionxeno> so its not lock with skills you use?
[2022-12-09 15:26:20] <h34dstr0ng> No Steeped in the Profane? Smadge
[2022-12-09 15:26:21] <rorshan> but good luck surviving up close with a squishy range build
[2022-12-09 15:26:22] <@%XaiTV> it seems buggy with EB to be fair
[2022-12-09 15:26:25] <BodyBones> bricked
[2022-12-09 15:26:30] <D3nticon> wait what happened to my mana costs n new pob LUL
[2022-12-09 15:26:30] <SuprMeatDude> I might actually use mark of submission temp chains to trigger profane bloom and bane despair/punishment for single target on my CA
[2022-12-09 15:26:31] <ryuukk__> that new PoB update is nice
[2022-12-09 15:26:31] <engravingfin> annoint?
[2022-12-09 15:26:34] <mateuszz_> 3 points to EB
[2022-12-09 15:26:34] <@%XaiTV> that's what I said build creators would be flooded with questions about KEKW
[2022-12-09 15:26:35] <jOORRi> mana pepeLaugh
[2022-12-09 15:26:36] <+WoefulMe> New update is bugged with leech/mana cost
[2022-12-09 15:26:36] <$Vernash_> @h34dstr0ng the penalty is 35% reservation rofl
[2022-12-09 15:26:39] <%arnastia> Yeah it ignores EB for that mana cost calc
[2022-12-09 15:26:42] <Lilyliciously> If there's feedback to the new PoB update gimme
[2022-12-09 15:26:49] <rorshan> ionxeno no since there's not a clear divide between what is ranged and melee
[2022-12-09 15:26:56] <Lilyliciously> @arnastia Not after the next hotfix
[2022-12-09 15:26:58] <!%Banaan_> pepeJAM

[2022-12-09 15:27:16] <Lilyliciously> @nugiyen EB will work for the mana cost section after next hotfix
[2022-12-09 15:27:21] <@%XaiTV> @Lilyliciously I guess you know about EB/lifetap already right?
[2022-12-09 15:27:23] <$charliehex> bowlJam
[2022-12-09 15:27:24] <ionxeno> @rorshan so it will calculate your distance from where will get hit
[2022-12-09 15:27:31] <%arnastia> @Lilyliciously oh nice
[2022-12-09 15:27:33] <Lilyliciously> @XaiTV Not in relation to each other what's up

[2022-12-09 15:27:40] <grizzlywood> @nugiyen  If I want to sort out stash tabs for Sanctum HC, I need to go do it in standard HC now?
[2022-12-09 15:27:41] <+jkrh1992> looking fresh @nugiyen. looking forward to more youtube content.  GL on league start
[2022-12-09 15:27:44] <rorshan> ionxeno most probably yeah
[2022-12-09 15:27:52] <@%XaiTV> @Lilyliciously more that lifetap seemed to have the same issue as EB in a quick test, it still says mana cost and stuff
[2022-12-09 15:27:53] VIEWERS: 1¬†619
[2022-12-09 15:27:56] <SuprMeatDude> @nugi what are you doing for curses?
[2022-12-09 15:27:59] <rorshan> grizzlywood yeah
[2022-12-09 15:28:01] <ariantes> the mana cost can be offset with +mana gain on hit in the shadow area for 1-2 points as you do a lot of hits @nugiyen
[2022-12-09 15:28:03] <@%XaiTV> @Lilyliciously but I didn't test extensively to be fair
[2022-12-09 15:28:04] <grizzlywood> ty
[2022-12-09 15:28:09] <nat5plzzzzzzzz> how long till league start

[2022-12-09 15:28:59] <@%XaiTV> @Lilyliciously only other small feedback I have now: can you make the "POESESSID" in the trade thing a password field? I can see streamers accidentally leaking their poesessid
[2022-12-09 15:29:05] <h34dstr0ng> Curses have insany fast cast speed anyway
[2022-12-09 15:29:17] <%TheLauron> what about witchfire? Or not worth?
[2022-12-09 15:29:21] <siko402> venom gyre?
[2022-12-09 15:29:25] <Lilyliciously> @XaiTV good shout, I'll have the people who did that bit look into it
[2022-12-09 15:29:42] <turkeyinthebath> are you taking silver flask ideally?
[2022-12-09 15:29:44] <+kermatykki_> anyone starting with ruthless mode ? :=)
[2022-12-09 15:29:52] <hollowman2020> the only mod I have ever seen on an item that has no clear explanation is "nearby enemies..." GGG has never put a specific radius and it's frustrating to know if you're getting the effect or not most times.

[2022-12-09 15:35:28] <Soulcube1982> @Kamegon because only nerds sitting at 8pm on a friday on pc and 4h later you go sleep anyway, in this time the market values change due to americans being able to play more than 12h while EU cant..at least normal people cant
[2022-12-09 15:35:34] <meelix> can i see the pconc pob somewhere nugi
[2022-12-09 15:35:34] <@%Andrew756> which results in 2 hour difference @QuackSage
[2022-12-09 15:35:36] <+arisuqt> i dont know what launch time you want, but starting at weekend is kinda the best. youre saying "only nerds are online at 8pm friday", dude if its outside weekend it  would be way way worse for working people

[2022-12-09 15:54:35] <@%XaiTV> you only need like 1 or 2 map sustain wheels at most
[2022-12-09 15:54:38] <@%XaiTV> the 3 pointers
[2022-12-09 15:54:48] <@%Andrew756> shapings are fine

[2022-12-09 15:54:53] <+captaind2020> If your getting chests you can generally drop in from above to pick up the good Kirac node.
[2022-12-09 15:54:57] <soma535> They did nerf his unique rates for uniques, but Kirac is still super OP for completions
[2022-12-09 15:55:00] <%Dying_Sun_> no i take all 4 and spec out of them after like 2-3 days its not a big deal. i really like a big pool at the start

[2022-12-09 16:09:11] <Lumen2708> huh? leveling her up?
[2022-12-09 16:09:17] <Empyrialist> Only running t3 maps or below, right?
[2022-12-09 16:09:17] <simplytheonion> wdym not upgrade? Like not do her in maps above a certain tier?
[2022-12-09 16:09:18] <$EpicAnon> Don't run it in T4+ Maps only T3 or lower I guess :S
[2022-12-09 16:09:18] <@%XaiTV> it's an average but it rounds down so hard you can't realistically
[2022-12-09 16:09:22] <etoxyi> @Lumen2708 zone level
[2022-12-09 16:09:22] <%Xynal> @Meliea_EU 90min nap EZ
[2022-12-09 16:09:25] <@%XaiTV> it's like temples yeah
[2022-12-09 16:09:27] <turkeyinthebath> highest level safehouse
[2022-12-09 16:09:32] <%Eqimetheus> i think the best is to run Max T3 Maps so the Boss fight is only lvl 70 and can only drop 2 Uniqs
[2022-12-09 16:09:33] <+Fireslap> !newvideo
[2022-12-09 16:09:33] <Domalash> how much does removing chance for some encounters increase the remaining's encounters chances?
[2022-12-09 16:09:33] <@^Nightbot> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXfrvvM5pXw
[2022-12-09 16:09:34] <simplytheonion> @EpicAnon okay
[2022-12-09 16:09:35] <DoctorSpectrum> only low tier maps tho, so your catarina is not high enough level to drop most of her drop pool
[2022-12-09 16:09:36] <Xenonic_Gaming> @MushramboVGC i mean for bosses
[2022-12-09 16:09:40] <axlex2> yeah you can bring the zone level average down similar to temple, not sure how it scales but i've had lvl 73 zones after doing a few low maps
[2022-12-09 16:09:46] <MushramboVGC> @Xenonic_Gaming oh no then
[2022-12-09 16:09:50] <turkeyinthebath> wiki says thats how it works yeah

[2022-12-09 16:10:31] <%PSL225> Okay is there a point to taking Ghost Dance if you're wearing Diadem and not MoM?
[2022-12-09 16:10:33] <+MosaOberon> why do you need a low level jun @nugiyen ?
[2022-12-09 16:10:34] <%Spiritual_Horse> prep!
[2022-12-09 16:10:35] <@%+DerangedM8> @warfirev i am YEP
[2022-12-09 16:10:39] <@%XaiTV> avg +10 up to a maximum of your highest zone
[2022-12-09 16:10:40] <Leah_R> @nugiyen how does one "not level jun too much"? Just not put jun missions on high lvl maps and ignore her if she spawns randomly?
[2022-12-09 16:10:45] <@%+DerangedM8> @warfirev took some days off of work FeelsOkayMan
[2022-12-09 16:10:50] <@%XaiTV> I think so, not sure
[2022-12-09 16:10:52] <+Drexfor> The average level of the content you've done the encounters in, plus ten, capped at the highest you've done.
[2022-12-09 16:11:15] <Lumen2708> how do you level jun up?
[2022-12-09 16:11:16] <rorshan> i mean what counts towards june ? is it any betrayal encounter or one where progress to the boss increases ?
[2022-12-09 16:11:17] <turkeyinthebath> if its capped at the highest you've done, cant you run 73?
[2022-12-09 16:11:18] <Empyrialist> So just never run a t4
[2022-12-09 16:11:26] <@%XaiTV> you wanna farm a bit of Foothills probably
[2022-12-09 16:11:28] <Empyrialist> easy, right?
[2022-12-09 16:11:34] <+Scroll_Of_Wisdom> @nugiyen so why do you want low?

[2022-12-09 16:12:52] <DoctorSpectrum> chat, if you dont know Its because some of the items she can drop have only start dropping at eg lvl 75, if you do low level catarina she can only drop diadem and urn
[2022-12-09 16:12:54] <%inglorious_wizard> how long does it take to farm her in foothils
[2022-12-09 16:12:59] <@%XaiTV> hmm, here it says 68, I heard Ventrua mention 73
[2022-12-09 16:13:05] <TwoBuckChuck_> 68 doesn't seem right
[2022-12-09 16:13:05] <@%XaiTV> so I'm not sure who to believe now

[2022-12-09 16:13:22] <%Eqimetheus> maybe they fixed it ?
[2022-12-09 16:13:33] <utzaman> if you never a big map to raise her level she will "spawn" at the average level. but still just juice your atlas and you will get the drop at some point
[2022-12-09 16:13:35] <CIimbaz> maybe the veiled mods have a different ilvl?
[2022-12-09 16:13:41] <rorshan> i also remember katarina being 75 minimum but no idea on what the source was
[2022-12-09 16:13:47] <TwoBuckChuck_> foothills it is kekw
[2022-12-09 16:13:50] <+Scroll_Of_Wisdom> @vietbeo2212 undecided. but very likely pathfinder pconc for a while

[2022-12-09 16:20:54] <serpentofset> torrent files aren't the file you want to download, they're like instructions for a torrent program to download the file, you use them for big files that would otherwise be rly hard to download in one big file

[2022-12-09 16:35:19] <rorshan> can you really spare 4 gems ?
[2022-12-09 16:35:20] <@%XaiTV> could even add unbound ailments for some duration

[2022-12-09 16:36:35] <screaminyetti> any ideas
[2022-12-09 16:36:37] <@%XaiTV> yeah, just get the shock chance on gloves or something

[2022-12-09 16:37:54] <+draltai> shock and wither are additive

[2022-12-09 16:38:22] <%+MangokidTV> @rorshan yeah, discharge needs a lot of investment
[2022-12-09 16:38:36] <rorshan> i mean that's why i said vaal flambelast
[2022-12-09 16:38:48] <rorshan> although vaal flicker strike maybe is a new contender for big ignites
[2022-12-09 16:38:52] <Cabledragon> are you looking for "shock damage?"

[2022-12-09 16:39:13] <@%XaiTV> I think it might be cause you deal too little damage
[2022-12-09 16:39:14] <@%XaiTV> I dunno
[2022-12-09 16:39:15] <Cabledragon> you'd have to manually calculate adding more damage multipliers and look at teh real damage

[2022-12-09 16:39:48] <@%XaiTV> it says something
[2022-12-09 16:39:48] <Cabledragon> no, it's not what i mean. i mean the calculated damage frmo "shock as though dealing more damage" just referring to it as "shock damage"
[2022-12-09 16:39:49] <@%XaiTV> I think?

[2022-12-09 16:40:36] <%+HK41251> Well that showed you having 90% shock because the threshold is 0

[2022-12-09 16:42:37] <+Dennis2k> @h34dstr0ng it shouldnt, since it doesnt with anything else with traps/mines ig?

[2022-12-09 16:42:55] <Cabledragon> the bow does have 300%
[2022-12-09 16:43:04] <+razzor1> snakebite for budget?

[2022-12-09 16:43:30] <%+HK41251> Hmm because I popped stuff into my PoB and my shock effect mob is "multiplied by 1". Like it says X 1. Yours says X 0...

[2022-12-09 16:43:46] <h34dstr0ng> @Dennis2k yeah, I thought so, just making sure because sometimes things that die off poison applied by minions trigger things as if it was a player kill

[2022-12-09 16:58:17] <+Drathmar> @rorshan My testing says otherwise, tested on standard without even a +1 wand or crit/power charge gear and could easily clear t16s on a 4-link with only a lvl 15 hydrophere and lvl 11 supports which is why I am considering it

[2022-12-09 17:09:21] <rorshan> nugiyen why do you say it's only 30% more damage? isn't going from -100 to -200 res 50% more ?
[2022-12-09 17:09:26] <skindiana363> @nugiyen helmet slot is huge opportunity cost since you can get so much reservation efficiency, eye of malice p much has to beat an additional aura

[2022-12-09 17:12:02] <+Bearded__Wonder> you have to reduce the enemies resistances to negative first then the increased on the helmet multiplies the negative in your favor

[2022-12-09 17:12:03] <serpentofset> chat, 50% increase just means multiply by 1.5
[2022-12-09 17:12:04] <jaeh131819> isnt there negative res cap?

[2022-12-09 17:12:13] <rorshan> nickneerd it does 1.5* res so if res is negative it's effectively a minus
[2022-12-09 17:12:15] <minozdj> 50% increased = 1.5* multiplier if thats easier to understand

[2022-12-09 17:16:46] <DeouTheDolphin> @rorshan it's a pretty old and well established term, linear scaling expresses linear scaling already LUL
[2022-12-09 17:16:54] <Sernaph> @Selluz id guess 1 hour before launch, so in 100 minutes or something?
[2022-12-09 17:16:57] <+mithul89> What build is Nugi going?
[2022-12-09 17:17:03] <@%Andrew756> patch nugiCheck Devcheck

[2022-12-09 17:17:11] <cynicustv> about what time can we open the client with the new content pack?
[2022-12-09 17:17:12] <serpentofset> @cynicustv ten minutes ago
[2022-12-09 17:17:12] <kamro85> @iCS3S EA Champ from Ziz should be good
[2022-12-09 17:17:13] <+TH3DISTURBED1> but if the "attack" is repeated 25 times, wouldn't vaal flicker with multistrike hit 25x3 times
[2022-12-09 17:17:13] <+Kruppe_Malazan> @cynicustv Whenever they announce patching is avaialble
[2022-12-09 17:17:14] <+Lazyargonist> best kind of napkin math
[2022-12-09 17:17:14] <rorshan> DeouTheDolphin yeah but since a lot of people don't understand that linear scaling mean diminishing marginal returns, using diminishing returns to explain it kinda makes sense
[2022-12-09 17:17:16] <+navigation4125> guys does the league start 1hour ealier than usual?
[2022-12-09 17:17:17] <DeouTheDolphin> @rorshan ye but then actual diminishing returns get misunderstood whenever they are in game
[2022-12-09 17:17:17] <+SlightRedeye> i remember multistrike cyclone OMEGALUL
[2022-12-09 17:17:18] <Akkiee> For CA + Arrow Nova, do you want some form of pierce?
[2022-12-09 17:17:18] <+FuzzyMidgett> What content is seismic not good at?
[2022-12-09 17:17:21] <cellfishxd> nugi i need help man. cold dot occ or rf jugg? @nugiyen
[2022-12-09 17:17:22] <+SlightRedeye> press it once and you're afk for 19 years
[2022-12-09 17:17:28] <+SlightRedeye> yeah it desynced you
[2022-12-09 17:17:30] <bruno_b0ss> YEP it would desync you
[2022-12-09 17:17:31] <i_wanna_be_reeducated> @Selluz 2h - 30minutes before, it depends on ggg
[2022-12-09 17:17:31] <@%XaiTV> I think so yeah
[2022-12-09 17:17:32] <+TH3DISTURBED1> @navigation4125 its 2hr42m
[2022-12-09 17:17:33] <rorshan> DeouTheDolphin yeah i know it's not ideal, that's just how it is :)
[2022-12-09 17:17:34] <Shugohakku> that was a thing

[2022-12-09 17:18:15] <MudcrabBlacksmith> RF Jugg PLUS cold dot in one build, perfect

[2022-12-09 18:07:06] <bitskipper> before blocking

[2022-12-09 18:07:17] <+Vanthorne> block meta for memes Kappa
[2022-12-09 18:07:20] <+ShawarmaFury> 40% for a rogue metamorph and 50% for regular encounter

[2022-12-09 18:07:37] <@%Andrew756> no
[2022-12-09 18:07:43] <ScubaSteve60> I think there is a pop out in the top right you can click that tells you your modifiers.
[2022-12-09 18:07:52] <%+Lordrahl88> i got like all my currency from tejun
[2022-12-09 18:07:52] <TheGargalon> are you playing SCSSF?
[2022-12-09 18:07:53] <@%+DerangedM8> why not use https://poeplanner.com/atlas-tree/ for planning smh peepoWtf
[2022-12-09 18:07:57] <TheSmiguli> Am I dead in the water if I block heist in SCSSF?
[2022-12-09 18:08:06] <%+Adelbertt> The abyss Snake + the 50% increase exp looks juicy too ....
[2022-12-09 18:08:09] <Oct0_Pus> if you dont use scarabs the 50%more keystone is a must right?
[2022-12-09 18:08:09] <+joewillrob> its so strong tho
[2022-12-09 18:08:09] <+BakinPacman> i think you block if your not specced into it
[2022-12-09 18:08:11] <ResurrectionByElection> for operative box
[2022-12-09 18:08:17] <kurlikkurlik3> not rly
[2022-12-09 18:08:22] <$ChichinGerberstein> no
[2022-12-09 18:08:23] <+mainlander> good chance for a couple corrupted 6 links
[2022-12-09 18:08:28] <Shatraugh> not worth the points imo
[2022-12-09 18:08:31] <hedronhijack> Is it metamorph league??
[2022-12-09 18:08:33] <+TH3DISTURBED1> its chance at scarabs
[2022-12-09 18:08:37] <PRophillex> metamorphs in tanes lab are not effected by this, right?
[2022-12-09 18:08:41] <+mainlander> but tainted fusings are good, and beyond on map device
[2022-12-09 18:08:42] <iBawz> @TheSmiguli imo Heist is the best farming league mechanic since it came out

[2022-12-09 18:10:40] <squatz91> Why so focused on metamorph?
[2022-12-09 18:10:41] <@%Andrew756> i think synthesis maps will be insane with all the old mods rolled into them by default @nugiyen lots of synthed items

[2022-12-09 18:11:26] <@%XaiTV> but that's more right side tree stuff
[2022-12-09 18:11:30] <@%Andrew756> @Ruuno old notables should be applied by default now
[2022-12-09 18:11:30] <coolfoolboo> dont forget harbinger with the new fracturing orb
[2022-12-09 18:11:32] <mustmees2> what about Harbringer
