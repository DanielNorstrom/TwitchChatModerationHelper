[2022-12-19 03:15:09] <!%Ebonslayer> @Peeve Your logic is enticing.
[2022-12-19 03:15:28] <@%Peeve> you think you're invading the DLC at 90?
[2022-12-19 03:15:30] <@%Peeve> LUL
[2022-12-19 03:15:45] <@%Peeve> i'm talking about future-proofing
[2022-12-19 03:15:45] <@%Peeve> yeah

[2022-12-19 03:15:53] <Antoniomarques01> not found ne1 at 40 :(
[2022-12-19 03:15:55] <@%saintriot> 200 has been a blast real talk
[2022-12-19 03:15:58] <@%Pallydan9K> Oh that makes sense peeve
[2022-12-19 03:16:00] <%$Noob_Almost> @Peeve oroBonk
[2022-12-19 03:16:00] <@%Peeve> no casual players will be at 150 or below in the DLC, assuming it's end game content as always

[2022-12-19 03:16:17] <Emerald_M> Did they announce dlc?
[2022-12-19 03:16:19] <PickledSosig> @saintriot agreed
[2022-12-19 03:16:21] <@%saintriot> it's like 40 but your build is finished and has 70 extra points
[2022-12-19 03:16:26] <@%Peeve> "Peeve you're right" ~Oroboro 30 times a day
[2022-12-19 03:16:29] <@%Pallydan9K> It’s a good thing I already have 20 characters with three unfinished
[2022-12-19 03:16:30] <%Qwozle> i really need to get my Magus to 200 it be possible but difficult
[2022-12-19 03:16:39] <%SkellyOfficial> predict the next dlc and i'll gift a sub if your correct oro, ill put it on my calendar and everything
[2022-12-19 03:16:39] <PungentMango> I think 150 would be fine for DLC probably the best starting point
[2022-12-19 03:16:39] <%SeanRAHX> Oro did you see the elden ring art books are up for preorder on amazon?? Pretty HYPERS
[2022-12-19 03:16:45] <%$xSHARKPUNCHx> yes there is dlc coming
[2022-12-19 03:16:45] <oofnewname> Sekiro didn’t have a dlc
[2022-12-19 03:16:47] <PickledSosig> level 200 lets a lot of the crappier weapons that have lots of scaling in different stats shine

[2022-12-19 03:16:50] <Emerald_M> Yeah fair, it is their best seller. Would be strange to not see dlc

[2022-12-19 03:16:52] <ACEBC> Lol whole lot of dlc talk for nothing
[2022-12-19 03:16:53] <TheOneNamedQ> No, but Elden Ring sold a billion copies and got GoTY.
[2022-12-19 03:16:56] <FadedVisage> Man I was thinking of making a 60...maybe Ill just make a 200 instead
[2022-12-19 03:16:56] <%+Dazitup> yooo NEED those
[2022-12-19 03:17:01] <%SeanRAHX> i'll put the link in the discord
[2022-12-19 03:17:04] <TheOneNamedQ> It’s going to have dlc, I mean, come on.

[2022-12-19 03:17:38] <ACEBC> They said dlc all year and dropped collesium
[2022-12-19 03:17:38] <%$Noob_Almost> @xSHARKPUNCHx for a guy with his stream titles and emotes he IS remarkably well informed
[2022-12-19 03:17:46] <%+Dazitup> those artbooks are beefy things man

[2022-12-19 03:18:40] <TheOneNamedQ> That emote belongs in a watch list
[2022-12-19 03:18:44] <suspiciouslymissingsock> 138 is so fucking boring, and very limiting considering Elden Ring isn't just another Dark Souls game. It's bigger in numerous ways.
[2022-12-19 03:18:45] <+nemesisrain> yes sir it is
[2022-12-19 03:18:49] <ACEBC> Better stay low level now days, its crazy at the top

[2022-12-19 04:52:03] <Reapy_s0ul> erdtree might beat it out unless you're dual wielding them
[2022-12-19 04:52:04] <+notkuporlly> I think erdtree is still better at 80 faith
[2022-12-19 04:52:07] <+Vschiffer> Yas two of them are
[2022-12-19 04:52:07] <KelsoTabasco> Yeah, no buckler?

[2022-12-19 04:52:08] <!%$StryfeDragon> I believe all the bonuses are like 20%
[2022-12-19 04:52:11] <+anarkeiii> erdtree is better but gravel is only better for lightning
[2022-12-19 04:52:12] <+Jaylangis> i havent been interacting with the souls community since dark souls 2 pvp sadCat
[2022-12-19 04:52:13] <Mrpenguin47_> It does
[2022-12-19 04:52:14] <%thefastandthefruity> for lightning incantations it beats it
[2022-12-19 04:52:19] <%shirou01> oh fuck ACFA file size is so big
[2022-12-19 04:52:22] <Viewer022> you can check on an enemy real quick. 0 weight for erdtree so would be great
[2022-12-19 04:52:26] <@%Pallydan9K> Yeah the seals you wanna use the STAB ones
[2022-12-19 04:52:30] <WhitefoxBlack> Not very hard to test
[2022-12-19 04:52:31] <mistergrimm99> i think it does if you're using dragon spells cause tge natural boost

[2022-12-19 04:52:41] <+darkedge42392> run 2 gravels
[2022-12-19 04:52:48] <Reapy_s0ul> if you had like 60 faith gravel stone seal would be on top
[2022-12-19 04:52:51] <haziqzahid2000> its been 20 fucking minutes and 0 gameplay
[2022-12-19 04:52:51] <%$GloriousDutch> This poor troll
[2022-12-19 04:52:52] <%shirou01> if u run 2 gravels that can beat erdtree yes
[2022-12-19 04:52:56] <+brzenczyszczykiewic5> erdtree doesnt have the 20% buff, but the incant scaling makes up for it, also you can use other spells well too
[2022-12-19 04:52:57] <Mrpenguin47_> @oroboro you could have a gravel stone seal in the offhand and erdtree mainhand
[2022-12-19 04:52:57] <!%Ebonslayer> @krwaze Red Lightning in general.
[2022-12-19 04:52:57] <+notkuporlly> its a full 50+ to incant scaleing I think

[2022-12-19 05:16:41] <%+KeetsScrimalittle> less faith?
[2022-12-19 05:16:42] <@%Peeve> like i said 200 is like you're trying to build for having 90% max efficiency on your build, but there's still a little give/take
[2022-12-19 05:16:43] <suspiciouslymissingsock> @Oroboro Godfrey's Icon, Shard of Alexander, Lightning Scorpion Charm, Great Jar Arsenal
[2022-12-19 05:16:48] <PickledSosig> vykes dragonbolt increases equip load so you can skimp on endurance maybe
[2022-12-19 05:17:05] <spacecowboy02071> Yea just have enough faith for the lighting buff

[2022-12-19 05:17:22] <suspiciouslymissingsock> Because you aren't using the right talismans smdh
[2022-12-19 05:17:25] <Mrpenguin47_> Double gravel stone seals will more than make up for less faith lol
[2022-12-19 05:17:26] <!%$StryfeDragon> For dex you really do need like 60-80
[2022-12-19 05:17:29] <%vitriolicjunior> use consumables
[2022-12-19 05:17:34] <+brzenczyszczykiewic5> also none of these spells are spells that actually hit people Sadge

[2022-12-19 05:18:20] <@%Peeve> wait does Vyke's Dragonbolt increase equip load? pvpWTF that's weird, if so though, drop Endurance, use Winged Crystal Tear, and if the fight lasts longer than that be set up where Vyke's Dragonbolt will cover you as well (at least w/ your lightest weapon equipped)
[2022-12-19 05:18:22] <+darkedge42392> @oroboro 65/65 split?

[2022-12-19 05:25:02] <PickledSosig> what about ritual sword for extra sniping damage?

[2022-12-19 05:52:09] <esteban_nomas> use the thunder that gives death (the one of fortisaxx)
[2022-12-19 05:52:11] <+brzenczyszczykiewic5> ancient dragons is so ass, death lightning is rng, glaive is easy to dodge, maybe just fortisax for the hyper armor, but it is still punishable at range

[2022-12-19 06:36:49] <%+Skwizgarr> we get Mohgs, but that's it

[2022-12-19 06:36:52] <@%Peeve> eh

[2022-12-19 06:37:01] <!%Ebonslayer> @Senyax But it's most likely he had Winged Crystal Tear.
[2022-12-19 06:37:07] <%+Skwizgarr> Mohg's would only be good in an area with a lot of enemies to buff
[2022-12-19 06:37:10] <%+Skwizgarr> not in a nopen field
[2022-12-19 06:37:13] <giacon7> mohg's nuts
[2022-12-19 06:37:14] <blood_tinge> you need a PHD in miyazakiology to effectively use mohg's rune
[2022-12-19 06:37:15] <@%Peeve> that's not true if the buffed enemy kills someone you get a full heal NODDERS
[2022-12-19 06:37:15] <SoulLUL> just use rivers of blood when you have mohgs rune 4Head
[2022-12-19 06:37:17] <Gardineros> im actually suprised not everyone is lightrolling at 200, you basically get it for free with that many stats
[2022-12-19 06:37:17] <Senyax> you mean havels ?

[2022-12-19 07:00:22] <cozzbp> Most fun non meta weapon to build around ATM?
[2022-12-19 07:00:22] <Ativ7> why recreate it?
[2022-12-19 07:00:24] <%PyroBebop> there is apparenytly a 4 hit true combo with scythe and loretta slash
[2022-12-19 07:00:28] <+diegoeraqui> grave scythe is my baby
[2022-12-19 07:00:37] <Senyax> so 150 it is ?
[2022-12-19 07:00:37] <+valterak9> @senyax I think everyone should just be allowed to have their great rune activated during PvP. Would solve the HP/damage problem immediately
[2022-12-19 07:00:46] <Gardineros> @valterak9 YESSSS

[2022-12-19 07:01:57] <%everypopisanemergency> what's the true combo with scythe??
[2022-12-19 07:02:09] <+valterak9> @senyax I mean, if everyone can have Radahn or Morgott great rune active then everyone immediately has like 500-800 more health at 60 vigor
[2022-12-19 07:02:11] <!%Ebonslayer> @chilled_G Better than Lances at least. Only one is infusable. :(
[2022-12-19 07:02:31] <+diegoeraqui> @everypopisanemergency R2 charged and then loretta slash
[2022-12-19 07:02:33] <pantsu__god> @Senyax at 60 vigor + the hp rune you get 2.5k hp
[2022-12-19 07:02:36] <3oclockradiohiya> I thought vykes dragon buff was shittier than the other buff
[2022-12-19 07:02:40] <fqteful> how did u get all the stuff in the game wow
[2022-12-19 07:02:56] <Lonefiire> hard work
[2022-12-19 07:02:57] <Diakill> Is somebody with a pc mule here?
[2022-12-19 07:03:02] <val_draconis> @Senyax main thing i feel with pvp is first overleveled summons getting fixed for more balance then you can lower the damage across the board in pvp so you wouldnt need even more health
[2022-12-19 07:03:09] <Senyax> yeah and it will makes runes more useful and fun to get
[2022-12-19 07:03:40] <!%Ebonslayer> @val_draconis I think they should just lower all the game's damage by around 20-30%. PVE and PVP.

[2022-12-19 07:06:14] <Senyax> they didnt patch the map LUL

[2022-12-19 07:11:20] <!%Ebonslayer> 673 and 691 AR is the difference between 70 and 80 Dex according to EIP.
[2022-12-19 07:11:20] <+Drunk_Suika> @diegoeraqui Literally a different genre and probably won't even have invasions, if it does have invasions then having covenants would be a good thing?

[2022-12-19 07:36:30] <pantsu__god> the entire story is basically different for the different endings since its not just a choice you make once at the end
[2022-12-19 07:36:30] <%shushir> Runebears wake up everyday and choose violence
[2022-12-19 07:36:33] <%Arnakhor> @Arnakhor look man, I have a low bar for humor
[2022-12-19 07:36:36] <%+direwolfnotinbed> how could you just ignore the great Kenneth Haight like that
[2022-12-19 07:36:38] <%oneaficionado> @shushir thank god. I’ve never played armored core but 6 looks amazing
[2022-12-19 07:36:39] <harley2123> Legendary weapons, magics, incantations, bosses, and endings are all of them I think.

[2022-12-19 07:36:45] <pantsu__god> special missions depending on the storyline you choose
[2022-12-19 07:36:49] <Guilty_mp4> wasn't there a pre-order gesture? maybe that's why there's no trophy?

[2022-12-19 07:39:36] <ixt000> DS2 was my first souls game and I loved it.  Not sure why people hate 2 so much
[2022-12-19 07:39:38] <%shushir> @KelsoTabasco Factual and scientifically quantifiable statement

[2022-12-19 07:40:37] <Senyax> its clunky mess
[2022-12-19 07:40:44] <%shushir> DS2 PvP is the best they've ever made
[2022-12-19 07:40:45] <Auro_Boros> DS2 objectively the best Souls.
[2022-12-19 07:40:49] <%shushir> ^
[2022-12-19 07:40:50] <%$MattCubedTf2> elden ring is literally ds2 2
[2022-12-19 07:40:51] <ImperialDuck_> the only bad part of ds2 was soul memory
[2022-12-19 07:40:51] <+hagly> I always hear DS2 pvp is good but I never hear why.
[2022-12-19 07:40:51] <!%Ebonslayer> @shushir All these games have those issues.
[2022-12-19 07:40:54] <%KoyFoster> DS2 was my PvP intro. I did so much back then.
[2022-12-19 07:40:55] <%+alimeria> leyShark best pvp ever
[2022-12-19 07:41:02] <Loodvigg> DS2 has the blue flame so it's the best one by default
[2022-12-19 07:41:04] <%$Noob_Almost> @shushir it's worse in er coz sometimes you get absolute pinnacle hitbox porn and other times...
[2022-12-19 07:41:04] <!%Ebonslayer> @hagly Best PVP easily.
[2022-12-19 07:41:10] <ImperialDuck_> soul memory sucked, everything else was amaaaazing
[2022-12-19 07:41:13] <midnightint0ky0> my youth was spent at iron forge bridge pvping
[2022-12-19 07:41:19] <+hagly> @Ebonslayer I hear but no one says why.
[2022-12-19 07:41:20] <KelsoTabasco> honor bridge, good times
[2022-12-19 07:41:21] <%+zekrond> Why was it so good
[2022-12-19 07:41:23] <TheRealWholehorse> If soul memory never existed, I probably would have given the pvp a chance.
[2022-12-19 07:41:24] <%shushir> I still have more hours in DS2 than any of their other games, and by a BIG margin, the PvP is just SO fucking GOOD
[2022-12-19 07:41:24] <val_draconis> @shushir the phantom range is still there but ive seen some sexy hitbox porn in elden ring too
[2022-12-19 07:41:24] <powerless_imp0> I really like it but I do think that it has the worst feeling gameplay out of all of them
[2022-12-19 07:41:26] <%+Oceansss> darksouls 2 had the best greatsword movesets in history or souls
[2022-12-19 07:41:28] <%$ShinnyMetal> What's with this DkS2 pvp hate?!
[2022-12-19 07:41:42] <ImperialDuck_> ds2 had sooo much variety
[2022-12-19 07:41:42] <WARm2155> Phantom glow was also amazing stacking with wins
[2022-12-19 07:41:45] <+diegoeraqui> ds2 was indeed fromsoft trying in pvp
[2022-12-19 07:41:48] <Senyax> everytime i roll i feel like having a diaper on
[2022-12-19 07:41:49] <%$ShinnyMetal> A lot of build variety too
[2022-12-19 07:41:51] <kingjobber_> You could dress up like a butterfly and do martial arts
[2022-12-19 07:41:52] <%shushir> @val_draconis ALl the games have both bad hitboxes as well as hitbox porn, it's so ridiculous LUL
[2022-12-19 07:41:52] <!%Ebonslayer> @hagly Simply put: best balance, tech that can amplify skill and mechanics that encouraged skill.
[2022-12-19 07:41:56] <%+alimeria> leyShark and dk2 got the best emotes
[2022-12-19 07:41:59] <Beldamnz> there's no way the string on that bow could launch that size of a projectile
[2022-12-19 07:42:00] <%KoyFoster> Yo. The invader auro was cool
[2022-12-19 07:42:04] <%shushir> REMEMBER PAHNTOM LEVELS!??!?!
[2022-12-19 07:42:05] <Senyax> thats about the only good thing LUL
[2022-12-19 07:42:05] <+Silthous> DS2 PvP was very good, but the PvE was very okay.
[2022-12-19 07:42:07] <%shushir> BECAUSE I DO
[2022-12-19 07:42:10] <harley2123> Yeah but I couldn't wear all havels, mom mask, and spam r1 with a buffed rapier so it sucked. /s

[2022-12-19 07:42:11] <Auro_Boros> Invader glow would intensify the more you won, shit was awesome

[2022-12-19 07:42:24] <%KoyFoster> The spell casting daggers were so cool
[2022-12-19 07:42:24] <%+zekrond> That sounds super cool, like an actual acknowledgement of the skill someone has that’s so cool
[2022-12-19 07:42:24] <%$MattCubedTf2> @Senyax you clearly haven't played
[2022-12-19 07:42:35] <Irish_Wiz> why do blues even exist in this game?
[2022-12-19 07:42:42] <hersgoriCM> wins minus loses actually

[2022-12-19 07:42:57] <Auro_Boros> Blues aren't entirely useless! They give me extra flasks

[2022-12-19 07:43:11] <%shushir> ALSO, DS2 is still From's ONLY game that giuves an actual in-game reward for challenge runs (no bonfire/ nod eath respectively), no other From RPG does that
[2022-12-19 07:43:15] <%+zekrond> Reminds me of WoW when people had the rank 14 gear. I like that there’s a sign that other players can see
[2022-12-19 07:43:17] <+diegoeraqui> blues are just sad people
[2022-12-19 07:43:17] <RavenBlue29> Why do people shit on others if they dont like dk2 ?
[2022-12-19 07:43:35] <%KoyFoster> True. No death, no bonfire.
[2022-12-19 07:43:36] <!%Ebonslayer> A great thing about DS2 is consecutive rolls cost increasing amounts of stamina. That means panic rolling is heavily punished.
[2022-12-19 07:43:37] <%+zekrond> What was the reward for challenge runs?
[2022-12-19 07:43:38] <%shushir> Also, DS2 STILL has the only cool NG+ cycles, which is so sad that we still don't have that in other games wraffSad

[2022-12-19 07:44:14] <%$MattCubedTf2> @RavenBlue29 People constantly bring up ds2 negatively for no reason, can't let go of the hate
[2022-12-19 07:44:14] <Senyax> to think elden ring has no covenants piss me off

[2022-12-19 07:46:38] <!%Ebonslayer> @shushir I figured from the start it'd play like DS3 but go further into the things I hated.
[2022-12-19 07:46:39] <RavenBlue29> Dks 2 is great. Some of the best dlc released (cept that blizzard unicorn place)

[2022-12-19 07:47:11] <%+zekrond> I just got into dark souls with 3, 2 years ago loved the ringed city dlc tho so much
[2022-12-19 07:47:12] <!%Ebonslayer> Never heard of them NOPERS

[2022-12-19 07:47:39] <%shushir> Even Bloodborne's (which is also awesome) is beaten by DS2 DLC, imo
[2022-12-19 07:47:42] <InsaneScientist> I wonder how big the dlc will be since delay is so long, will it be something huge like Elder Scrolls Shivering Isles I'm thinking
[2022-12-19 07:47:42] <powerless_imp0> I prefer the ringed city over DS1 DLC

[2022-12-19 07:47:51] <!%Ebonslayer> @MattCubedTf2 DS2 had the highest highs and lowest lows. I loved some parts of the DLCs, hated others.
[2022-12-19 07:47:53] <val_draconis> i did love fighting against Gael in ng+7
[2022-12-19 07:47:56] <KelsoTabasco> 2-3 DLCs i imagine
[2022-12-19 07:47:57] <+Riley__P> ringed city was dog water if gael didnt exist, the enemies were mindnumbing
[2022-12-19 07:48:00] <SoulLUL> They said several ideas for ER expansions during TGA IIRC
[2022-12-19 07:48:08] <%+Oceansss> 3 dlc's minimum
[2022-12-19 07:48:08] <%+zekrond> They did
[2022-12-19 07:48:15] <%shushir> I thing a trilogy of DLC, much like DS2. MAYBE even a Scholar rework

[2022-12-19 07:48:46] <theIMPimp> a lot of the changes in scholar were 🤮
[2022-12-19 07:48:52] <harley2123> Scholar I didn't actually like, it shoved enemies in weird places.
[2022-12-19 07:48:53] <ImperialDuck_> Scholar rework would be odd for ER
[2022-12-19 07:48:53] <%dotterel2> @theIMPimp agree

[2022-12-19 07:49:12] <harley2123> DS2 made me VERY paranoid.
[2022-12-19 07:49:15] <Senyax> @Oroboro pick one bloodborne remake or dark souls 1 remake
[2022-12-19 07:49:18] <jdub726> did dark souls 2 get game of the year?

[2022-12-19 07:49:18] <%shushir> @Ebonslayer Demon Princes was the better O&S, and it wasn't close
[2022-12-19 07:49:19] <cozzbp> Iron keep enemy placement was AIDS in SOTFS
[2022-12-19 07:49:29] <!%Ebonslayer> @shushir Hugely disagree.

[2022-12-19 07:49:36] <!%Ebonslayer> But I don't like either.

[2022-12-19 07:49:52] <theIMPimp> a lot of sections in scholar felt like they made it more difficult but not in a fun or skillful way
[2022-12-19 07:49:54] <%+CrimsonGunRose> I would love that dream area.
[2022-12-19 07:49:56] <Smathane> Oohh the dream take my money
[2022-12-19 07:49:58] <Irish_Wiz> would we stay in the lands between? or would we go into the outer space and kill some outer gods?
[2022-12-19 07:49:59] <+Riley__P> no way it doesnt expand on the weird space shit imo
[2022-12-19 07:50:02] <Nikushimi_Zero> DLC takes us to the stars! To SPACE! Lol

[2022-12-19 07:50:48] <InsaneScientist> I hope we can go to dlc areas low level, also we need more elden bling armor sets
[2022-12-19 07:50:56] <%+ZeGreatPumpkinani> I feel like elden ring DLC has to give us more actual gods to slay. Elden Beast wasn't even a true outer god was it? Just a manifestation of the elden ring?
[2022-12-19 07:50:59] <+Solaris4> All i want from Elden Ring DLC is a Musketeer hat.
[2022-12-19 07:50:59] <!%Ebonslayer> @shushir It can be pretty annoying if you don't have any ranged.
[2022-12-19 07:51:13] <%+CrimsonGunRose> It would be cool to see post game acknowledgement if you've become Elden Lord, but then do the dlc.

[2022-12-19 07:51:19] <OptPlaysGames> @shushir when I didn’t understand DS2 I tilted out of the game at amana. on a second try years later I cleared it easily
[2022-12-19 07:51:22] <%shushir> Also, just rolling at the right times
[2022-12-19 07:51:25] <!%Ebonslayer> @shushir Unless you're shit at parrying.

[2022-12-19 07:51:41] <+diegoeraqui> @senyax launch pvp was an un balanced mess
[2022-12-19 07:51:48] <val_draconis> with how big the games areas are we shoulda had servers
[2022-12-19 07:51:51] <KelsoTabasco> @Ebonslayer I feel personally attacked
[2022-12-19 07:51:56] <Iced_Dude> ER is incredible, but From games have always had horrible netcode @Oroboro
[2022-12-19 07:52:03] <!%Ebonslayer> @KelsoTabasco I'm describing myself too, don't worry.
[2022-12-19 07:52:05] <%shushir> @Ebonslayer Rolls, parrying, and ranged all work for that area
[2022-12-19 07:52:09] <Iced_Dude> As a 20 year Armored Core vet, it's the same shit there too
[2022-12-19 07:52:19] <%shushir> Also, Shrine of Amana is legit gorgeous

[2022-12-19 07:52:26] <+diegoeraqui> well now with light rolls you cant roll catch
[2022-12-19 07:52:28] <!%Ebonslayer> @shushir Rolls is still tricky because sometimes the casters can frametrap you.

[2022-12-19 07:52:57] <$LordGubbey> Fromsoft would never change the netcode because if ppl start rubberbanding or having their attacks and inputs eaten, they'd blame the game rather than their shit connection

[2022-12-19 07:53:22] <%KoyFoster> Man. I like light rolls. Wish they weren't broken.
[2022-12-19 07:53:26] <%shushir> @Travsnip 4 answer was PS4, I think?
[2022-12-19 07:53:32] <The_Pyxis_Child> @shushir I had such a love-hate relationship with Shrine of Amana, it was so cool but so torturous
[2022-12-19 07:53:39] <!%Ebonslayer> @KoyFoster I think they need a slight distance nerf. Nothing extreme but some nerf.
[2022-12-19 07:53:39] <pantsu__god> @Solaris4 outspace and trade yes, pray they have good enough net to trade
[2022-12-19 07:53:40] <Senyax> remember parry's ? LUL

[2022-12-19 07:54:00] <%shushir> Scholar Shrine was a little better: those NPC summons could help people that were struggiling
[2022-12-19 07:54:05] <%+greywolf540> I find the distancing in pvp to be enjoyable to play with
[2022-12-19 07:54:12] <pantsu__god> as it is now light rolls are literally faster than sprinting which is the biggest problem
[2022-12-19 07:54:13] <val_draconis> light roll makes NG+7 a joke too
[2022-12-19 07:54:20] <+piimpshrimp> at least they usually take more damage and have no poise

[2022-12-19 07:54:24] <%KoyFoster> Maybe they should move the roll distance into backstep i frames.

[2022-12-19 07:54:57] <val_draconis> i bullied NG+7 malenia with a light roll build
[2022-12-19 07:55:01] <+piimpshrimp> Didn’t Ds2 have Npc invaders when you go into ng+ we need the for elden ring
[2022-12-19 07:55:15] <!%Ebonslayer> Here's the thing regarding balancing light rolls: you need to remember it's intended (read: not the broken ass tear) to be the mobility equivalent of the poise and defenses we take for granted. It needs to be of equal or similar value to that loss.
[2022-12-19 07:55:19] <Senyax> well i can parry in dks 1 and 3 ER is bad parrying is just not it
[2022-12-19 07:55:32] <%shushir> @piimpshrimp Additional NPC invaders, yeah. Pre-DLC the only way to farm Onion Armor was an invader in FOrest of the Fallen Giants
[2022-12-19 07:55:33] <KelsoTabasco> @val_draconis light roll is the way to go for malenia imo, no matter the build
[2022-12-19 07:55:53] <powerless_imp0> I've heard it said that a lot of japanese games are that way because their server models are built around the idea that it's going to only be played in the country, is that at all true
[2022-12-19 07:55:54] <%+greywolf540> Gonna try some pvp with my pve build lol. Feel the need to be punished.
[2022-12-19 07:55:56] <PickledSosig> easy fix just make light roll subtract your negations by 2000

[2022-12-19 07:56:24] <+diegoeraqui> @Ebonslayer you can make light roll build in 125 with 80 + poise and good armor. no flask required
[2022-12-19 07:56:24] <+Solaris4> @powerless_imp0 Certainly not with Capcom and Nintendo.
[2022-12-19 07:56:25] <+hagly> Light roll needs it's distance nerfed. Just enough to escape most weapons besides long reaching pokes.
[2022-12-19 07:56:27] <pantsu__god> @greywolf540 a good build is a good build regardless of pve or pvp
[2022-12-19 07:56:35] <val_draconis> @val_draconis nahhh timing is the main thing with malenia i love fighting her on my medium roll Vargram build but she's super easy with light roll is all

[2022-12-19 07:59:43] <%+greywolf540> The key to success is single pointed concentration.
[2022-12-19 07:59:48] <XileElekt> idk, I go 126 and still find plenty of duels :)
[2022-12-19 07:59:49] <%shushir> @Senyax This is why he liked lvl 3 DMB on a Falchion so much back in the day wraffSmug

[2022-12-19 08:00:54] <%shushir> @hagly Makes sense
[2022-12-19 08:00:54] <BlickyBrock> AC6 could make mechs mainstream

[2022-12-19 08:01:26] <+hagly> Armored core is literally built differently lol.
[2022-12-19 08:01:26] <%shushir> @tiltNM It's cross-generational and has a higher population than XBox. Not sure how it compares to PC< though
[2022-12-19 08:01:28] <PickledSosig> im honestly still shocked at how popular elden ring was
[2022-12-19 08:01:28] <+Mosbuttpirate> Gotta give Bethesda's new game a chance Kappa

[2022-12-19 08:01:35] <%$Noob_Almost> @alimeria i miss tenchu Sadge
[2022-12-19 08:01:36] <pantsu__god> @diegoeraqui bro the last armored core game sold like 100-200k copies. dark souls games were in the millions
[2022-12-19 08:01:38] <icylot> souls are not for everybody either
[2022-12-19 08:01:41] <%+zekrond> Saw gameplay and idk wtf is going on
[2022-12-19 08:01:44] <Senyax> just like sekiro
[2022-12-19 08:01:46] <BlickyBrock> apparently theres a game that's almost done but it isn't armored core 6
[2022-12-19 08:01:46] <%shushir> I love AC, because there's just SO MUCH STUFF to custimize.
[2022-12-19 08:01:50] <val_draconis> bruh are you saying my Armor core models arent gonna be Mainstream???
[2022-12-19 08:01:52] <Senyax> its a tenchu
[2022-12-19 08:01:59] <+Howzzer_> and they are going back towards 4 and for answer so its gonna be greatness
[2022-12-19 08:02:04] <Smathane> Too much hype is a curse
[2022-12-19 08:02:06] <TheRealWholehorse> FFXVI and Armored Core VI in the same year. Weaboos eatin good.
[2022-12-19 08:02:06] <Senyax> ppl think its souls KEKWait
[2022-12-19 08:02:07] <+diegoeraqui> @pantsu__god I Get it, but FromSoft is a big boy name now
[2022-12-19 08:02:11] <!%Ebonslayer> @Howzzer_ They said it'll be like For Answer?
[2022-12-19 08:02:14] <+piimpshrimp> weren’t u talking bout how cool it’d be to have souls combat in ac
[2022-12-19 08:02:19] <!%$Mohl97> @Howzzer_ we don't know that for certain

[2022-12-19 08:02:23] <moonbath> I'm pretty sure AC isnt for me unless they let you exit ur mech, which i doubt
[2022-12-19 08:02:27] <+Howzzer_> they said they are going back in that direction yea
[2022-12-19 08:02:38] <fishykrep> whats fav weapon

[2022-12-19 08:02:48] <+Glopatronicals> hows AC 5 compaire to AC 4?
[2022-12-19 08:02:50] <ImperialDuck_> armoured core looks interesting at least, so, gonna be cool to see how it turns out
[2022-12-19 08:02:56] <RavenBlue29> I lowkey hope a kings field gets a new game. First person would be cool
[2022-12-19 08:02:58] <%shushir> Solid Armored Core advice for all the newbie zoomers: Reverse Legs are the way.
[2022-12-19 08:03:03] <%+CrimsonGunRose> Moonlight is my favorite too.
[2022-12-19 08:03:04] <+Howzzer_> 5 was garb
[2022-12-19 08:03:10] <+Howzzer_> too slow
[2022-12-19 08:03:18] <Kerra192> bloodborne HMS is the best one
[2022-12-19 08:03:22] <$umbasaFGC> what was different in 5
[2022-12-19 08:03:23] <%shushir> ^
[2022-12-19 08:03:24] <Magmathrower8> personally I think fromsoftware are absolute fucking geniuses of game development so I'm a big fan of everything they make
[2022-12-19 08:03:30] <%+Dazitup> 5 also had you do some wierd team creation right at the start
[2022-12-19 08:03:31] <Big_Calcium> If someone hasn't played one, which should they start with?
[2022-12-19 08:03:34] <!%Hilink24> i think 5 will be slower too
[2022-12-19 08:03:36] <+Howzzer_> it wasnt chromhounds
[2022-12-19 08:03:36] <%threothree> @oroboro dunno if I’m gonna play but looking forward to catching an op stream
[2022-12-19 08:03:37] <%shushir> Armored COre MLGS was kind of like a Gundam laser sword, tbh
[2022-12-19 08:03:37] <FleaMeKnee> Hey oro just so you know fires deadly sin and bloodflame blade bug is back
[2022-12-19 08:03:38] <BlickyBrock> what about verdict day?
[2022-12-19 08:03:39] <FleaMeKnee> !lurk
[2022-12-19 08:03:40] <!%Hilink24> i mean 6
[2022-12-19 08:03:42] <+Howzzer_> which is what they went for
[2022-12-19 08:03:42] <Magmathrower8> I'm gonna play armored core 6 even though I have very little idea what it will be like
[2022-12-19 08:03:43] <+Gary985> i loved bloodborne I wish the pvp was better :(
[2022-12-19 08:03:45] <$LordGubbey> i prefer the slower gameplay tbh. thats what the series was before 4th generation
[2022-12-19 08:03:47] <miniman314> that sounds cool
[2022-12-19 08:03:48] <+diegoeraqui> I will watch gameplay before buying
[2022-12-19 08:03:55] <$umbasaFGC> is it like that for honor clan thing?
[2022-12-19 08:04:01] <Iced_Dude> Based on the trailer for 6, it's looking like it's in the same universe as FA/4 based on the shields @Oroboro
[2022-12-19 08:04:12] <miniman314> the trailer was hype excited for itr

[2022-12-19 08:04:49] <froobz> the 5 was too slow argument seems kind of irrelevant when you see videos of people parkour hopping on walls like they're on crack
[2022-12-19 08:04:57] <Senyax> wait Armored Core had Tournaments WHAT
[2022-12-19 08:05:01] <+diegoeraqui> @froobz lol
[2022-12-19 08:05:15] <%threothree> I wonder if I’d find 5 better just being more used to mechwarrior from waaay back in the day lol
[2022-12-19 08:05:23] <Iced_Dude> When I say universe, I mean mechanically. So like ER is to Souls. @Oroboro
[2022-12-19 08:05:24] <$Pokeable_> I've played all the souls games and I have not played any of the AC games Considering its a FromSoftware game. I'm might get into it because I love the mechs.
[2022-12-19 08:05:26] <+Howzzer_> compared to 4/FA. 5 was slower that smoke off shit
[2022-12-19 08:05:27] <+ursorlirious> did u play "dark and darker" playtest? @Oroboro
[2022-12-19 08:05:29] <pantsu__god> @Iced_Dude bro all the games share most of the same concepts
[2022-12-19 08:05:31] <Iced_Dude> I should have clarified
[2022-12-19 08:05:33] <+diegoeraqui> armored core is fromsoft doing balanced pvp
[2022-12-19 08:05:43] <%Honako> Any hype for Dragon's Dogma 2?
[2022-12-19 08:05:44] <beau_xo> so no patches?
[2022-12-19 08:05:46] <!%Hilink24> what about patches tho
[2022-12-19 08:06:02] <Iced_Dude> @pantsu__god You must be new to AC lol. There are very clear differences between the different generations lol
[2022-12-19 08:06:11] <!%$Mohl97> @Honako hype that it exists, but can't be too much more hyped until we actually see it
[2022-12-19 08:06:12] <+ursorlirious> i asked for the first time :)
[2022-12-19 08:06:14] <%Honako> :D
[2022-12-19 08:06:20] <BlickyBrock> Armored core lore consist of corperations being crazy as fuck
[2022-12-19 08:06:20] <!Lyevi> It's like DnD tarkov, it's fun

[2022-12-19 08:06:51] <$umbasaFGC> dank and danker is a very janky video game
[2022-12-19 08:06:51] <%threothree> I asked…. Once ;)
[2022-12-19 08:06:54] <pantsu__god> and yet they all have giant corporations you work for as a mercenary raven (lynx in 4 only) using things called armored cores and even weapons that carry over.
[2022-12-19 08:06:54] <!Lyevi> It feels a little slow imo but it can be a little fun, especially with friends
[2022-12-19 08:06:55] <%$Noob_Almost> nope
[2022-12-19 08:06:55] <Senyax> ER dlc lies of p dragon dogma re 4 remake

[2022-12-19 08:06:58] <%threothree> @oroboro hell yeah.
[2022-12-19 08:06:58] <KelsoTabasco> it's fun but janky, kinda rough solo tho
[2022-12-19 08:07:00] <+ursorlirious> it's a fun first person pvepvp dungeon crawler
[2022-12-19 08:07:06] <%$Noob_Almost> maybe if they work on some stuff

[2022-12-19 08:07:10] <+ursorlirious> with hardcore loot mechanic
[2022-12-19 08:07:10] <!%Hilink24> its fun but its a BR balanced arround 3 people teams @Oroboro

[2022-12-19 08:13:08] <%snuggienutz801> what is the incant used a lot in PVP to block magic damage in ER?
[2022-12-19 08:13:12] <%shushir> Hollow Knight is a legit masterpiece considering only half a dozen people made it, and it's FIFTEEN BUCKS WITH ALL DLC'S FREE
[2022-12-19 08:13:13] <HoneyNuts> june 2024
[2022-12-19 08:13:15] <$Travsnip> silksong isn't real

[2022-12-19 08:13:58] <%dotterel2> have you heard of or tried Rain World? takes time to git gud but its awesome
[2022-12-19 08:14:00] <!%Ebonslayer> @shushir I wanted to but found out I suck at platforming.
[2022-12-19 08:14:11] <$Travsnip> I always have trouble finding where to go in hollow knight
[2022-12-19 08:14:12] <+ursorlirious> @dotterel2 holy f man rain world is the best game ever made
[2022-12-19 08:14:13] <+ursorlirious> ngl
[2022-12-19 08:14:14] <Iced_Dude> Dark and Darker looks like a game that should be a VR game
[2022-12-19 08:14:14] <%shushir> @Ebonslayer I also do, but it was still awesome
[2022-12-19 08:14:16] <%dotterel2> YOOO finally a transistor fan. omg its amazing

[2022-12-19 08:15:10] <HoneyNuts> what does oro want
[2022-12-19 08:15:10] <%shushir> Blasphemous, also known as "Catholicism; the Metal Album Cover; the Game" is also great
[2022-12-19 08:15:12] <+NuggetChan1> right fcking now
[2022-12-19 08:15:12] <+ursorlirious> @dotterel2 same man
[2022-12-19 08:15:12] <%+Dazitup> yeh i was hooked on that game so early on. its insane
[2022-12-19 08:15:13] <RavenBlue29> Hades is a top 5 up there with Dead cells
[2022-12-19 08:15:14] <+StygianSky_> you should play it now
[2022-12-19 08:15:19] <%Honako> Do it!
[2022-12-19 08:15:19] <%Honako> :D
[2022-12-19 08:15:19] <Irish_Wiz> play pokemon
[2022-12-19 08:15:25] <1pancakes> if only there was more than 4 hours in a day
[2022-12-19 08:15:25] <KelsoTabasco> @KelsoTabasco I know the feeling, been practicing for over 30 years and I still feel like a complete amateur lmao
[2022-12-19 08:15:28] <!%Ebonslayer> @KelsoTabasco Me and platforming just disagree on every fundamental level. I consider the addition of jumps in ER to be detrimental.
[2022-12-19 08:15:29] <%+zekrond> Hades is super good, spear is my favorite
[2022-12-19 08:15:31] <+ursorlirious> downpour gonna be awesome
[2022-12-19 08:15:33] <!%$Mohl97> I'd love to see ultrakill, but only if you 100% it
[2022-12-19 08:15:44] <josh_same> just play it bro, frick what the stream wants.
[2022-12-19 08:15:48] <+ursorlirious> grime just got a free dlc as well
[2022-12-19 08:15:56] <%dotterel2> @ursorlirious yeah i just reinstalled RW to do another playthrough before it releases in january. gotta refresh myself lol
[2022-12-19 08:15:57] <josh_same> play stuff for yourself and let chat come along
[2022-12-19 08:16:18] <+ursorlirious> @ursorlirious game is so rough, souls games are a cakewalk compared to
[2022-12-19 08:16:23] <HoneyNuts> @josh_same you dont even subscribe
[2022-12-19 08:16:23] <KelsoTabasco> new game + paper route, let's go

[2022-12-19 08:16:40] <RavenBlue29> I like to think people enjoy oro over Elden ring
[2022-12-19 08:16:42] <%Honako> Your core audience that will watch anything is getting pretty big tho :D
[2022-12-19 08:16:47] <josh_same> @HoneyNuts neither do you.
[2022-12-19 08:16:48] <%shushir> I'd legit take a 30% cut in income if it meant I could do stuff I love instead of stuff I hate, tbh; there's no safe guarantee, though wraffSad
[2022-12-19 08:16:56] <+doodlemansketch> we need a dlc in this game so bad
[2022-12-19 08:16:57] <+hagly> Channels have died hearing those words.
[2022-12-19 08:16:57] <Reloaded211> Play Witcher 3
[2022-12-19 08:16:57] <HoneyNuts> @josh_same im not telling him to not think about money
[2022-12-19 08:17:01] <!%$Mohl97> a decent amount of us stuck around for armored core 4 at least
[2022-12-19 08:17:07] <beau_xo> i mean what about armored core lol
[2022-12-19 08:17:25] <Tankerdarren> Nobody would be here if he played sports games
[2022-12-19 08:17:28] <%Honako> I hope AC6 has a strong PvP scene
[2022-12-19 08:17:32] <KelsoTabasco> i'd be fine with that, with some soulslike on the side
[2022-12-19 08:17:51] <%+greywolf540> If i get a cool next game game for my next gen console I will buy it.
[2022-12-19 08:17:57] <%+direwolfnotinbed> i would unironically sweat my balls off for AC6 PvP
[2022-12-19 08:18:00] <!%Ebonslayer> The games *were*. This is modern Fromsoft.
[2022-12-19 08:18:06] <x_BMC> was also on a weekend you stream AC, could've had some viewer inflation that way
[2022-12-19 08:18:06] <+diegoeraqui> lol
[2022-12-19 08:18:08] <fishykrep> whats your opinion on the colesiums
[2022-12-19 08:18:08] <froobz> @Honako theres still a dedicated fanbase of 13 years old playing online LULW
[2022-12-19 08:18:10] <pantsu__god> bro everyone will be crying about pvp tryhards in ac6 because all of the hidden veterans from japan and elsewhere
[2022-12-19 08:18:15] <powerless_imp0> I am interested to see how the current fromsoft handles a mission based game
[2022-12-19 08:18:17] <%shushir> Yeah, just don't expect Armored COre PvP to be like SoulsBourne PvP though chat; it's VERY VERY different

[2022-12-19 08:18:33] <%+greywolf540> Interesting
[2022-12-19 08:18:40] <$LordGubbey> you spend like 75% of the PvE fighting other ACs so it needs to be balanced around PvP gameplay
[2022-12-19 08:18:40] <%Honako> @froobz It's not enough for most streamers tho
[2022-12-19 08:18:41] <ThatsFugly> My favorite thing about Armored Core is the pornography made in the emblem creator.
[2022-12-19 08:18:49] <+hagly> Souls pvp is a tertiary thought to fromsoft lol.
[2022-12-19 08:18:51] <%shushir> @ThatsFugly wraffLUL
[2022-12-19 08:18:52] <vVergil_NeoLoFi> recent interview miyazaki said that they will focus the single player this time thou @Oroboro
[2022-12-19 08:18:53] <KelsoTabasco> @ThatsFugly KEKW
[2022-12-19 08:18:54] <Iced_Dude> Armored Core PvE only exists to unlock all parts so that you can then play PvP @Oroboro
[2022-12-19 08:19:04] <!%Ebonslayer> Again, *were*. Fromsoft will make changes.
[2022-12-19 08:19:08] <froobz> @Honako its very niche considering you'd have to have gotten into it 8-10 years ago
[2022-12-19 08:19:11] <CoffeeSack> do you think elden ring dlc will come out before AC6 or after??
[2022-12-19 08:19:15] <pantsu__god> @vVergil_NeoLoFi that's compared to V and VD which were extremely multiplayer focused
[2022-12-19 08:19:19] <!%$Mohl97> @ThatsFugly You should play PSO2 then, you get symbol art that works like a banner you can post in chat that does exactly that
[2022-12-19 08:19:29] <Iced_Dude> I'm speaking for me. I will suffer through S ranking every mission just to unlock every part
[2022-12-19 08:19:31] <%shushir> Keep in mind too; Miyazaki worked on I think AC 5 and NO other AC game, too
[2022-12-19 08:19:31] <%Honako> ACfA had a pretty amazing PvE
[2022-12-19 08:19:33] <GeneraIRadhan> u havent played AC. stop capping bruv
[2022-12-19 08:19:48] <%+greywolf540> I mean if the game focuses on the detail of each mechanical mech upgrade it will be crazy.
[2022-12-19 08:19:52] <+Strayed1> @vVergil_NeoLoFi maybe we'll get a coherent story in AC this time around
[2022-12-19 08:19:57] <!%$Mohl97> if I remember what I've heard right, during the armored core days the dev team had a habit of holding tournaments with each other and using those to balance the game before launch
[2022-12-19 08:20:06] <KelsoTabasco> @Strayed1 COPIUM
[2022-12-19 08:20:09] <CoffeeSack> i may be on a unholy amount of COPIUM but I wonder if Elden Ring DLC is taking long because it will be huge like monster hunter expansion packs
[2022-12-19 08:20:11] <%shushir> People have a hard time imagining From without Miyazaki, but they've existed without him longer than with, tbh
[2022-12-19 08:20:13] <Tankerdarren> Are you just speedrunning the graces right now?
[2022-12-19 08:20:16] <!%Ebonslayer> @Mohl97 0% chance that will happen now.
[2022-12-19 08:20:17] <froobz> @shushir miyazaki worked on last raven, ac4 and acfa
[2022-12-19 08:20:19] <$LordGubbey> the PvE in AC games always has batshit stories too

[2022-12-19 08:20:34] <Iced_Dude> I was a top 5 player on ranked for both 4 and FA. I promise you that if you buy an AC game with the PvE intended as your primary play experience, you will be disappointed
[2022-12-19 08:20:39] <Iced_Dude> Those games are meant to be played PvP
[2022-12-19 08:20:47] <fishykrep> do you like the colessiums
[2022-12-19 08:20:53] <+Strayed1> @KelsoTabasco as long as the pvp is decent, I really couldn't give a fuck about anything else, 10 years since the last AC game LUL
[2022-12-19 08:20:53] <powerless_imp0> if anything is inspired by souls it seems like it might be the story
[2022-12-19 08:20:55] <!%Ebonslayer> @Iced_Dude Were meant to be.
[2022-12-19 08:20:59] <%shushir> @froobz Wondering if maybe I'm thinking of leadership/ public roles, then
[2022-12-19 08:21:07] <KelsoTabasco> @Strayed1 Oh yeah I'm 100% with you lol
[2022-12-19 08:21:07] <CoffeeSack> yup yup the short ploy description on AC6 store page has me hyped
[2022-12-19 08:21:08] <%shushir> I'll have to look into it
[2022-12-19 08:21:11] <CoffeeSack> plot*
[2022-12-19 08:21:13] <%Honako> lol
[2022-12-19 08:21:15] <vVergil_NeoLoFi> Rivers of Guns in AC? @Oroboro let's goou
[2022-12-19 08:21:16] <%+greywolf540> Oh damn nice
[2022-12-19 08:21:19] <$LordGubbey> golden sneed
[2022-12-19 08:21:24] <Iced_Dude> I've been waiting for AC6 for literally 9 years
[2022-12-19 08:21:32] <CoffeeSack> Patches the sniper? Pog
[2022-12-19 08:21:32] <!%Ebonslayer> @vVergil_NeoLoFi MOONLIGHTveil
[2022-12-19 08:21:35] <froobz> @shushir ac4 and acfa were the first time he directed, i believe
[2022-12-19 08:21:42] <SaiyukiNoKami> Hhhhh op
[2022-12-19 08:22:17] <CoffeeSack> they baited me good with the fires and let the cinders burn lul
[2022-12-19 08:22:19] <%Honako> Most hype I've ever been from a trailer
[2022-12-19 08:22:28] <Iced_Dude> The closest thing we got to AC6 in the past years was Daemon X Machina which was a passable AC clone on the switch
[2022-12-19 08:22:31] <+bigfloppafan47> Hi

[2022-12-19 08:22:38] <%shushir> @froobz Yeah, seems like you're correct from what I've seen. Thanks for the correction wraffLove
[2022-12-19 08:22:43] <vVergil_NeoLoFi> @vVergil_NeoLoFi maybe we will get a Moonlight greatsword POG
[2022-12-19 08:22:47] <fishykrep> what is armor core
[2022-12-19 08:22:48] <+Strayed1> we were legit jebaited like 4 times that we would get a AC announcement during a game show
[2022-12-19 08:22:57] <%Honako> Hope we get gameplay soon 👀
[2022-12-19 08:22:58] <!%Ebonslayer> I want to play AC4, but my computer is too shit for emulators.
[2022-12-19 08:23:13] <+Strayed1> AC has always had the best Trailers/intro movies
[2022-12-19 08:23:18] <Iced_Dude> @vVergil_NeoLoFi So every iteration of AC has always had both a Moonlight and a Karasawa
[2022-12-19 08:23:21] <ddrbaked> The aesthetic reminded me of killzone but with mechs
[2022-12-19 08:23:23] <+Howzzer_> It looked just like the old ones w White Glint. Gives me hope.
[2022-12-19 08:23:27] <KelsoTabasco> @fishykrep armored core, mech combat franchise from the same company that makes dark souls
[2022-12-19 08:23:27] <Iced_Dude> We will likely get it in the new version
[2022-12-19 08:23:40] <powerless_imp0> I'm guessing we will get a gameplay trailer in the spring
[2022-12-19 08:23:48] <%+direwolfnotinbed> also if you like spending 4 hours in the refit screen
[2022-12-19 08:23:52] <Irish_Wiz> is it time to roll out?
[2022-12-19 08:23:55] <giacon7> launch window estimates? i think Q3
[2022-12-19 08:23:56] <!%Ebonslayer> @vVergil_NeoLoFi MOONLIGHT is the original version of what we know as the MLGS. That and the King's Field Moonlight Sword.
[2022-12-19 08:23:59] <%VastatioCazzo> What about OW Gundam Kappa
[2022-12-19 08:23:59] <Iced_Dude> I told my fiance that the week that AC drops, I'm taking a day off of work and ignoring her @Oroboro lmao
[2022-12-19 08:24:00] <vVergil_NeoLoFi> @Iced_Dude Didn't know that, that's cool af
[2022-12-19 08:24:02] <CoffeeSack> is it just me or does anyone else remember Armored Core model kits in hobby stores that used to be sold way back??
[2022-12-19 08:24:07] <%$ShinnyMetal> I've only played armored core 2 but I loved that game and think about it all the time. If I were to pick one up to play right now which one should I?
[2022-12-19 08:24:18] <+Xguiltyxasxsinx> Is this your lvl 200?
[2022-12-19 08:24:23] <%shushir> By FAR the best feature of Armored COre games is just how in-depth the custimization goes, though. Makes most RPG's look shallow in comparison
[2022-12-19 08:24:31] <Silicone_Waffle> wish I knew about armored core when I was younger tbh, always loved mechs but never saw much content of it
[2022-12-19 08:24:32] <vino_ny> which armored core is best to start with for us dark souls players?
[2022-12-19 08:24:34] VIEWERS: 1 261
[2022-12-19 08:24:36] <Iced_Dude> @ShinnyMetal You can't go wrong with AC4. AC:FA is deeper, but it's less AC than you'll be used to
[2022-12-19 08:24:42] <Iced_Dude> AC4 is the correct stepping back in point
[2022-12-19 08:24:53] <!%Ebonslayer> Now time for the other 90% of the game. oroPog
[2022-12-19 08:24:54] <vino_ny> ^answers it lol
[2022-12-19 08:24:55] <+Howzzer_> its nothing like dark souls. get that out of your head
[2022-12-19 08:25:01] <%shushir> ^^^^
[2022-12-19 08:25:06] <!%$Mohl97> @Iced_Dude I'd say start with 1
[2022-12-19 08:25:15] <%Honako> If you don't care about story I'd say just start with For Answer
[2022-12-19 08:25:20] <%shushir> AC=/= to soulsborne, and people shouldn't expect it to be
[2022-12-19 08:25:22] <!%$Mohl97> 4 and For Answer are nice, but you'll alienate yourself to the rest of the series if you only play them
[2022-12-19 08:25:24] <%Honako> If you care about story start with 4
[2022-12-19 08:25:24] <Irish_Wiz> what happened to armored core 5?
[2022-12-19 08:25:31] <%+greywolf540> Fresh start then
[2022-12-19 08:25:33] <%shushir> @Honako Yeah, I'd agree wiht this
[2022-12-19 08:25:37] <giacon7> what armored core should i start with as a deracine gamer? :)
[2022-12-19 08:25:41] <$Pokeable_> If only I still have my ps3 FeelsBadMan
[2022-12-19 08:25:45] <vVergil_NeoLoFi> is 5 any good?
[2022-12-19 08:25:46] <%+direwolfnotinbed> 1 and 2 were both great, never played 3
[2022-12-19 08:25:46] <Iced_Dude> @Mohl97 Fair point, but he was trying to get into "current" AC I think
[2022-12-19 08:25:49] <+Strayed1> don't be a coward, start with AC1
[2022-12-19 08:25:57] <Iced_Dude> If you're asking me which one is the best? Last Raven is the best. It's not debateable
[2022-12-19 08:26:09] <+Strayed1> ^^^^
[2022-12-19 08:26:12] <!%$Mohl97> @Iced_Dude "current" would be 5 then, as that plays totally different from 4, which plays totally different from 1-3
[2022-12-19 08:26:13] <%$ShinnyMetal> I'm actually playing a fantastic mech strategy game right now called Phantom Brigade. Highly recommend it
[2022-12-19 08:26:14] <%shushir> Should still give 5 a fair shake, imo; 4 and FA are better, though
[2022-12-19 08:26:20] <froobz> @Iced_Dude if you add H+ to the player, its the best Kappa
[2022-12-19 08:26:22] <Tyagdit> was AC pvp netcode/connection also jank?
[2022-12-19 08:26:24] <%shushir> At least, imo
[2022-12-19 08:26:33] <%Honako> Hardcore fans are always trying to get people to start with the odler ones, But most people won't enjoy those tbh
[2022-12-19 08:26:34] <Iced_Dude> Last Raven >>>>
[2022-12-19 08:26:36] <%shushir> @Tyagdit ALL From netcode is jank wraffLUL

[2022-12-19 08:26:43] <vVergil_NeoLoFi> AC 4 remastered would be nice

[2022-12-19 08:26:45] <RavenBlue29> Froht mission 4 is an awesome Mech game
[2022-12-19 08:26:51] <Tyagdit> @Tyagdit lol rip
[2022-12-19 08:26:52] <Hollowatcher> The old ones would be cool if the control schemes weren't so draconic
[2022-12-19 08:26:53] <Iced_Dude> Front Mission 4 is horrendous lol
[2022-12-19 08:26:53] <$Pokeable_> Goodnight Oro!!

[2022-12-19 08:27:15] <%shushir> Alternatively, find someone with older consoles and ask to borrow it, maybe?

[2022-12-19 08:27:56] <giacon7> you mean hades tomorrow? :)
[2022-12-19 08:27:58] <%shushir> IS there any RL range that snags both 150 and 200? Pretty sure the answer is no, but figured I'd ask just in case

[2022-12-19 08:28:21] <!%$Mohl97> anyway, if anyone ends up trying out one of the old armored core games: Remember that you can rebind your controls in-game. Set the camera to the face buttons and use the shoulder buttons for weapons
[2022-12-19 08:28:30] <%shushir> ^^^^
