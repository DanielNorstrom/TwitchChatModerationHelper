[2023-01-06 14:35:42] <minkwi> fast 9 not as good as previous sets
[2023-01-06 14:35:44] <CactuS_BicepS> Lategame is worse the lower the elo. In higher elo only people that can go 9 take it
[2023-01-06 14:35:50] <%ashraf_hs> maybe next patch we can fast9
[2023-01-06 14:36:00] <%testificatetft> I assume people taking it are mostly highrolling pretty hard, its hard to stablize on 9 even with the extra gold, 3 costs are just so strong

[2023-01-06 18:00:03] <mauvekyutai> I feel like going 8th is like that one ex you can't get over, no matter how much you try to go for 9s or 8s or sometimes even 7s you will end up going back to your abussive 8th. yeah you might be with a good balanced 1st or 2nd but WOOPS, you missed 2 star leona on the rolldown, you get the bonk and you go back to your old time 8th, but don't worry, even if it hurts being with 8th, 8th will always wait for you with open arms

[2023-01-06 18:19:10] <+totalwitchvibe> wait patch release?
[2023-01-06 18:19:10] <%iankulovsky> @zine3123 5 days to span animalia, the new yummi
[2023-01-06 18:19:11] <%$kayesel> peepoRain
[2023-01-06 18:19:12] <%twerkforjesuss> the patch notes look a little sus atm
[2023-01-06 18:19:25] <zine3123> I am looking forward to no more yuumi
[2023-01-06 18:19:26] <phloxinvarrose> there's no official patch notes, just pbe changes
[2023-01-06 18:19:27] <assistidor12> @killergiraffe1 go on mort stream, I think there isn't for now
[2023-01-06 18:19:32] <myles_a_way> yeah
[2023-01-06 18:19:35] <Strawhatteur> new patch is on tactics tool > pbe
[2023-01-06 18:19:36] <Ziggy_Buckets> correct
[2023-01-06 18:19:40] <n1ghthawk19> That's every patch no?
[2023-01-06 18:19:41] <%twerkforjesuss> They also just change WAY too much - why does every unit need to be adjusted every patch?
[2023-01-06 18:19:44] <%ltspol> isn't that every set?
[2023-01-06 18:19:48] <%ashraf_hs> anima gonna be broken next patch
[2023-01-06 18:19:48] <Ziggy_Buckets> The patch always breeds something new that'll be intolerable
[2023-01-06 18:19:48] <+paranoidEdu> unofficial notes on tactical dot tools
[2023-01-06 18:19:50] <Greed589> Something will always be broken
[2023-01-06 18:19:50] <haydenalxander> but at least it wont be jax and yummi every game
[2023-01-06 18:19:52] <%$alederman> they did nerf supers a good bit so hopefully it isn't as bad
[2023-01-06 18:19:58] <+Stentzinator> is that not just how tft works no?
[2023-01-06 18:19:58] <myles_a_way> I mean things can be broken or relatively strong but rn Yuumi Supers is just gross rn
[2023-01-06 18:19:59] <%+Leahkim> DIESOFMAGE
[2023-01-06 18:20:03] <+paranoidEdu> I think nothing can be more broken then yuumi
[2023-01-06 18:20:03] <zoispao13> i mean if they nerf mascots and supers im good ok
[2023-01-06 18:20:05] <%+Alexmae> ye but its always gonna be like that idk
[2023-01-06 18:20:08] <+ChaoticSteps> R&D for this game sucks
[2023-01-06 18:20:12] <Inzini3rius> they nerfed heavily supers

[2023-01-06 18:20:13] [Announcement] <Nightbot> This Double Trouble Kai'Sa game is the definition of "JUST HIT" https://youtu.be/ZetlebpKmoU
[2023-01-06 18:20:14] <+killergiraffe1> im down
[2023-01-06 18:20:14] <%twerkforjesuss> The supers nerf is pretty huge right now
[2023-01-06 18:20:15] <phloxinvarrose> supers was very nerfed actually
[2023-01-06 18:20:17] <+scarkiwi> just get rid of hero augments imo
[2023-01-06 18:20:19] <%ashraf_hs> supers got huge nerf
[2023-01-06 18:20:22] <zine3123> I mean its not that hard to nerf supers? Just reduce the % dmg they get
[2023-01-06 18:20:22] <haydenalxander> I wish they rotated champs out every other week
[2023-01-06 18:20:23] <%twerkforjesuss> but yeah completely agree
[2023-01-06 18:20:23] <+Reaperman438> just drop supers bonus dmg to 2.5%
[2023-01-06 18:20:24] <+swaggie365> big nerf
[2023-01-06 18:20:25] <Plebejers> getting rid of supers would be nice, i like hero augments
[2023-01-06 18:20:27] <Kon_Ant> where do we see the patch notes?
[2023-01-06 18:20:27] <laboon_kun> i hope they delen aug hero 2-1
[2023-01-06 18:20:32] <zine3123> They can also fuck with the units stats as well
[2023-01-06 18:20:32] <%Dawad321> Hot take but I dont like the supers nerf
[2023-01-06 18:20:35] <batmanji> I like how they said they wanted to avoid balance thrashing this set and then the first major patch is all balance thrashing ok
[2023-01-06 18:20:38] <zine3123> make em weaker on 3*
[2023-01-06 18:20:38] <Jolrael> I'll take supers over duelist brawlers fiesta any day
[2023-01-06 18:20:40] <%Dawad321> Just nerf specific hero augs instead
[2023-01-06 18:20:40] <Strawhatteur> supers got giga nerfed so that should be ok
[2023-01-06 18:20:41] <+paranoidEdu> to me the nerf on supers was not that big
[2023-01-06 18:20:43] <+StankyWAP> You don’t think they can tweak super numbers to make balanced?
[2023-01-06 18:20:53] <%twerkforjesuss> @zine3123  they did both - so many units got adjusted at 3*
[2023-01-06 18:21:02] <%ashraf_hs> crabPls blue battery is gone crabPls
[2023-01-06 18:21:06] <haydenalxander> they should have a pool of champs that switch in and out every two weeks
[2023-01-06 18:21:07] <myles_a_way> best nerf to Supers is removing it

[2023-01-06 18:21:32] <+Reaperman438> they could adjust 1 cost odds at 5 and 6
[2023-01-06 18:21:39] <trixsterisass> but if supers heavy nerf what kills Jax reroll
[2023-01-06 18:21:39] <batmanji> chat what units do you tlhink they get rid of in mid-set... not which ones you want gone but which would actually get removed
[2023-01-06 18:21:41] <Strawhatteur> @MrSoodler99 tactics.tool
[2023-01-06 18:21:42] <CinnamonWaffle> they done the same thing with mascots even mort admitted in the sense where balancing it becomes a tricky job
[2023-01-06 18:21:43] <soloqscoundrel> before the set release mort predicted supers would be the most popular trait of all time
[2023-01-06 18:21:52] <MrSoodler99> ty !

[2023-01-06 19:04:49] <%j0d0> Nah supers fundamentally breaks TFT - there has to be a trade-off or risk for reroll comps, and they have to be narrow in opportunity, otherwise they're the default best comp.  They put way to much pressure on the loby.
[2023-01-06 19:04:56] <+ordinaryowl_> Agreedge, definitely unfortunate timing with holidays too, bc this would likely already be fixed

[2023-01-06 19:14:06] <%+itspanduuh> @daarkliing much smaller team tho. the companies i are worth billions. yes mort and his team are apart of riot. but  again much smaller team, so things are scuffed and will take time. but those other games have hundred of people that can relay feed back and they even reach and ask for feedback yet it's rarely and or never reciprocated

[2023-01-06 19:42:31] <stubbedy> The phrase “it’s just a game” is such a weak mindset. You are ok with what happened, losing, imperfection of a craft. When you stop getting angry after losing, you’ve lost twice. There’s always something to learn, and always room for improvement, never settle.

[2023-01-06 20:01:58] <Amaeri> @Fallenrenegad3 That's one way of recovery, but I'm sure hitting 3* Yasuo even if late is better because she can bleed out into a 6th instead of going for 8th in case she doesn't hit even while pushing levels. Plus she sank so much econ in already that playing catch-up to lvl 7 w/ tempo lobby isn't gonna do much good (sry for lengthy reply)

[2023-01-06 20:54:54] <xzragexz> Neal (Neil) is a given masculine name and surname of Gaelic and Irish origin. The name is an Anglicisation of the Irish Niall which is of disputed derivation. The Irish name may be derived from words meaning "cloud", "passionate", "victory", "honour" or "champion".
