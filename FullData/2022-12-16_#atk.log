[2022-12-16 20:11:27] <CadzFPS> even duriing primetime for content like valtan it can take like 30 to 1 hour
[2022-12-16 20:11:37] <xynzjuh> Anyone in chat know why I still have my old gloved when upgrading to Brel brelic tier. Had them equippied damn near shit myself when I saw item level go down lol
[2022-12-16 20:11:57] <+Iron_Rice_Bowl> Just dismantle it for chaos stones
[2022-12-16 20:12:13] <+Iron_Rice_Bowl> It's gonna happen every time we get a new relic set upgrade now I think
[2022-12-16 20:12:17] <SouKK> Stare
[2022-12-16 20:12:51] <solarcross123> @xynzjuh that happened to me as well and i had a minor heart attack at that moment
[2022-12-16 20:12:55] <xynzjuh> Thanks, I was so confused at first went down 15 ilvl im like wtf happened untill i noticed lol
[2022-12-16 20:13:02] <CadzFPS> one thing im hoping for with loaon is hoping they make the experiancing or playing a support more enjoyable so more people like me would be inclined to play it
[2022-12-16 20:13:07] <+Iron_Rice_Bowl> KEK me too til I saw the other set of gloves in the inventory
[2022-12-16 20:13:15] <CadzFPS> experiance of*
[2022-12-16 20:13:20] <CadzFPS> but thats jsut my copium
[2022-12-16 20:14:01] <+Iron_Rice_Bowl> Adge
[2022-12-16 20:14:24] <+Iron_Rice_Bowl> @CadzFPS This is why I'm looking forward to artist
[2022-12-16 20:14:27] <Daijoubunel> Imagine they add Artist earlier, than add Reaper or Summoner.....
[2022-12-16 20:14:30] <+Iron_Rice_Bowl> The playstyle seems more involved
[2022-12-16 20:14:39] <+Iron_Rice_Bowl> than bard or pally in my opinion
[2022-12-16 20:14:41] <CadzFPS> no offence im glad you like but even artist so smodge
[2022-12-16 20:14:45] <CadzFPS> like ity
[2022-12-16 20:15:03] <%monts18> yea all 3 of my bards has static KEKW I aint going to pug them with your shitty ass alts with lvl 5 gems KEKW
[2022-12-16 20:15:15] <DarkArrak> well paladin is really chill, bard can be somewhat involved
[2022-12-16 20:15:45] <+Iron_Rice_Bowl> I mean what's the one thing bard can do that's really interactive with raids we have so far? Blocking cc like clown laser
[2022-12-16 20:15:49] <CadzFPS> its just not fun artist to me is dps nut head looks smodge iswell
[2022-12-16 20:15:54] <CadzFPS> as*
[2022-12-16 20:16:10] <Daijoubunel> For me, only Bard is support. Paladin players are very bad.... :S My experience....
[2022-12-16 20:16:34] <%+zoxtr0t> @Daijoubunel D:
[2022-12-16 20:16:37] <+Lookana> howdy everyone

[2022-12-16 20:16:54] <CadzFPS> your
[2022-12-16 20:17:03] <solarcross123> ppl are starting to go full dps at g5-g6. despair is at whole different level.
[2022-12-16 20:17:05] <DarkArrak> paladin's counters are S-tier, can really help in some raids
[2022-12-16 20:17:12] <CadzFPS> but your streamer iswell so i guess it benefitd you anyway
[2022-12-16 20:17:26] <%WingedMenace> I've just experience a weird attempt at a "support Gunlancer" at matchmaking Caliligos. Man, that thing was an insta block
[2022-12-16 20:17:28] <%+zoxtr0t> @DarkArrak i got 100% counters on calg yday with my pally
[2022-12-16 20:17:56] <%WingedMenace> Was using Yearning, explosive expert, vital point hit and drops of ether. Super disgusting

[2022-12-16 20:18:18] <+so_joe> 12 cali is like 500 hp pot
[2022-12-16 20:18:19] <+so_joe> xD
[2022-12-16 20:18:20] <%csr_roman> doing just 3 cali's is enough for me Deadge
[2022-12-16 20:18:21] <%+mentaI___> everyone I know hates him KEKW
[2022-12-16 20:18:27] <solarcross123> i have 3 caliligos chars and it gives me hard times to deal with
[2022-12-16 20:18:34] <Daijoubunel> Bynn Ark site is exist on EU servers too? @ATK
[2022-12-16 20:18:35] <%monts18> atkDes
[2022-12-16 20:18:35] <DarkArrak> Despairge I have 6 chars at 1490
[2022-12-16 20:18:37] <%+salpngytis> i do 6x2 caliligos - its so pain man
[2022-12-16 20:18:39] <+Iron_Rice_Bowl> Carl is definitely way more annoying than kunga or deska
[2022-12-16 20:18:40] <solarcross123> i can't imagine 12 chars
[2022-12-16 20:18:54] <%monts18> bring back my turtle Smadge
[2022-12-16 20:18:55] <+Iron_Rice_Bowl> But it's gotten better even in the last two days
[2022-12-16 20:18:58] <%+mentaI___> still kill him in 3 mins in my static
[2022-12-16 20:19:12] <+Iron_Rice_Bowl> People still don't grab 5x white orbs which really tilts me though
[2022-12-16 20:19:13] <%csr_roman> carl is back attackers worst nightmare Deadge
[2022-12-16 20:19:32] <%+mentaI___> imagine not doing guardians full rested tho
[2022-12-16 20:19:36] <+Lookana> I've made it a point to only run Carl with my guild hasn't been too bad
[2022-12-16 20:19:40] <+Iron_Rice_Bowl> Failing stagger check in Carl Aware
[2022-12-16 20:19:49] <+Lookana> maybe next week can start pugging xD
[2022-12-16 20:19:49] <FamiMisaki> ill only run carl with my guild for at least 2 weeks
[2022-12-16 20:19:50] <+Iron_Rice_Bowl> fucking ElCheapo

[2022-12-16 20:20:45] <%+mentaI___> doing dailies unrested is too much of a hassle, i dont like them
[2022-12-16 20:21:01] <%monts18> because you have to use battle items
[2022-12-16 20:21:07] <%monts18> thats why it sucks YEP
[2022-12-16 20:21:18] <+Iron_Rice_Bowl> If the other three are monkeys you lose time
[2022-12-16 20:21:34] <CadzFPS> i mean you are forced to do it cause of the mats KEKW
[2022-12-16 20:21:35] <11lucas1> I have solo prokel with red gl 1500, is that an achievement?
[2022-12-16 20:21:58] <FamiMisaki> @11lucas1 ill be doing prokel on my 1490 gs with my static later xdd
[2022-12-16 20:22:10] <+so_joe> @11lucas1 gunlancer is one of the easiest to do it but anyone soloing it their first week is kinda impressive imo
[2022-12-16 20:22:28] <+Iron_Rice_Bowl> Prokel is a lot of fun

[2022-12-16 20:31:29] <+so_joe> @ATK i think thats applicable to all things in life, but its one of those things where you either break the cycle or adjust it to help that feeling be smaller
[2022-12-16 20:31:36] <+so_joe> its hard to break those type of cycles
[2022-12-16 20:31:47] <11lucas1> that guides are a looooot of work tbh, it helps a lot too
[2022-12-16 20:31:48] <+so_joe> but the community loves your guides i can say that, all 6 of my guilds groups used your guides

[2022-12-16 20:33:15] <FamiMisaki> nah its okay atk i understand you dont have to worry too much about the guides and stuff if its already too much
[2022-12-16 20:33:16] <+so_joe> cut off your foot to save your leg
[2022-12-16 20:33:22] <11lucas1> u need to cut some stones, Kappa
[2022-12-16 20:33:43] <FamiMisaki> its like those voice actors / seiyuus in the anime industry who have to leave because of their illness. Leaving behind all their success behind etc
[2022-12-16 20:34:02] <%+sar__3> do you really need 3 editors tho?
[2022-12-16 20:34:27] <FamiMisaki> yeah I understand]
[2022-12-16 20:35:08] <%+sar__3> you probably be happier if just play the game and turn on stream whenever you feel like it
[2022-12-16 20:35:25] <FamiMisaki> @sar__3 i agree with sar
[2022-12-16 20:36:11] <FamiMisaki> Cant lie though, if you ever feel like doing guides anymore at least you went out with a banger guide for the entire brel raid (at least on normal)
[2022-12-16 20:36:35] <+so_joe> yeah i mean i think youre so liked you could stop the guides if that was causing you too much stress
[2022-12-16 20:36:39] <+so_joe> and just stream casually for a year
[2022-12-16 20:36:43] <+so_joe> and then see where youre at
[2022-12-16 20:36:54] <11lucas1> time to try bdo
[2022-12-16 20:37:00] <+so_joe> ah
[2022-12-16 20:37:10] <FamiMisaki> yeah thats what I feel that im getting from how it sounds
[2022-12-16 20:37:12] <+so_joe> no its real life
[2022-12-16 20:37:14] <+so_joe> its not greedy\
[2022-12-16 20:37:17] <+so_joe> you cant live for free
[2022-12-16 20:37:25] <FamiMisaki> you pour so much effort but you feel shitty because you dont get much for it its okay
[2022-12-16 20:37:28] <%+sar__3> when you see lobby tittle in NA party finder saying "must watch atk guide" you know you have done something right
[2022-12-16 20:37:28] <+so_joe> cant give everyoen everything and get nothing for it
[2022-12-16 20:37:31] <+so_joe> that leads to depression and burn out
[2022-12-16 20:37:38] <FamiMisaki> its like getting into a relationship and then after maybe 4 years it doesnt work out
[2022-12-16 20:37:52] <FamiMisaki> things fall apart no matter how hard you worked for it
[2022-12-16 20:38:04] <%+sar__3> I will screen shot it when I see it next time
[2022-12-16 20:38:05] <roelram> just put time stamps and its big chilling

[2022-12-16 20:39:38] <LeumasIX> yo atk, your editors are adults too. i know you want to take responsbility for them but if the budget didn't work out, you need to change it. maybe a higher % on net profits... not a salary setup.
[2022-12-16 20:39:48] <LeumasIX> they can handle themselves bro :D

[2022-12-16 20:47:40] <Hellspawner> @ATK serious question: since legion raids have a count of only 3 then wouldn't valtan, vykas and kakul be kinda useless when thaemine comes out since you'll only be doing brel, akkan and thaemine ? doesn't this sound stupid to have them forgotten ?
[2022-12-16 20:47:41] <mikemyk26> @ATK  we got a bug in g2 we had 2 guys inside vs prokel haha
[2022-12-16 20:47:52] <+TragicBlast> for LOAON ima need to wake up at 6 am kms
[2022-12-16 20:48:05] <FamiMisaki> @mikemyk26 HUH
[2022-12-16 20:48:56] <%yoohyeonisn> so ez g2? atkNoted
[2022-12-16 20:49:00] <+Gumri_> @ATK was there a support draught in kr pre artist release?
[2022-12-16 20:49:14] <mikemyk26> @FamiMisaki  blob:https://imgur.com/62bbdd15-7132-44ab-b55f-de6f0af81e04 HAHA
[2022-12-16 20:49:16] <%LoDestroyer> @FamiMisaki Which raids are you having troubles finding groups>?
[2022-12-16 20:49:32] <+so_joe> @Hellspawner they would only be wasted on mains
[2022-12-16 20:49:41] <+so_joe> no ones whole roster is that high on average
[2022-12-16 20:49:45] <FamiMisaki> @FamiMisaki mainly vykas tbh. Supports just dont like seeing 1460 lobbies these days
[2022-12-16 20:49:49] <+so_joe> i feel like alts will alaways do some of the first 3
[2022-12-16 20:49:56] <%Vyse_Hex> @Hellspawner it would be waste for the higher up player not lower one tho
[2022-12-16 20:50:08] <FamiMisaki> @mikemyk26 i think the link is broken though cant open it
[2022-12-16 20:50:13] <%csr_roman> just like reddit KEKL nothing but doomers
[2022-12-16 20:50:25] <Hellspawner> @so_joe then like i said they would be forgotten which would be stupid to have fought valtan for so long to then not even doing him for eternity
[2022-12-16 20:50:47] <%Vyse_Hex> @so_joe it aint stupid tho
[2022-12-16 20:51:02] <Canidae5> challenge legion raids inc?
[2022-12-16 20:51:28] <%Vyse_Hex> @Canidae5 most likely no since there's hell mode for them

[2022-12-16 20:54:38] <%LoDestroyer> @FamiMisaki Well my group pretty much have enough alts to carry or needs to be carried so whenever we do have room we could squeeze you in if you don't mind? Because we have a static group but once everyone basically has done all the raids with their main we usually do the weaker alt runs together with some strong DPS to counter balance it.
[2022-12-16 20:54:44] <%+Kaizeo_> bro my shard goin down so fast atk
[2022-12-16 20:54:57] <%LoDestroyer> @FamiMisaki so I could add you and whenever we got room I could ask you
