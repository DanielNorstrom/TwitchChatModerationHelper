[2022-12-17 00:28:36] <%+Jaymakilla> Will im not sure because ive spent a year or two away but when summit was playing did you ever teach/raid with him?
[2022-12-17 00:28:38] <%Sandos386> @Roflstompkillr its just a bunch of random crap, like when you extract from a PMC/SCAV extract

[2022-12-17 00:30:37] <%kuliboys1> better to have grey then to be bald
[2022-12-17 00:30:45] <+GhillieGang_> Hey chat, i have a decent PC build but only 16 GB of RAM, would you recommend going to 32 for tarkov or will it not really improve as much as people say?
[2022-12-17 00:30:47] <+PuppetMaster176> only way this game goes to console is if they connect a mouse & keyborde.
[2022-12-17 00:30:58] <%+nexin6> hope you get some raids in with summit next wipe
[2022-12-17 00:30:58] <%+kloc_tower> i have had a receeding hairline since just after high school
