[2023-01-06 14:31:29] <+Daemyrs> shipping has always been such a foreign concept to me
[2023-01-06 14:31:40] <@%KafroHudrep> honestly twitter has so many subcultures there's no "real ediquitte" there's terminology that becomes popularized
[2023-01-06 14:31:41] <%westernstyleguy> it's 'posting' you're right
[2023-01-06 14:31:58] <%+EosLuna> @KafroHudrep agreed
[2023-01-06 14:31:59] <VogonPoetry_42> only reply to things that obviously are asking for a reply from anyone
[2023-01-06 14:32:06] <@%KafroHudrep> i think the quote tweet things is for like algorithm purposes
[2023-01-06 14:32:10] <%godot_was_here> because quote tweets of an artist's art result in people replying to the quote tweet and the actual artist not getting as much attention/replies for their art

[2023-01-06 14:34:22] <@%KafroHudrep> I can sort of understand if an artist is trying to use it to build their career but I just think dealing with any of these platforms is having to go by their whims
[2023-01-06 14:34:23] <GenericMattr> for alot of artists posting at certain times can have a massive difference on income

[2023-01-06 14:34:45] <+berrrrrd> i don't really understand getting mad at it because the engagement that's generated by that quote retweet is something the original author could not accomplish themselves
[2023-01-06 14:35:08] <%+starchyfriend> i mean, quote retweets is better than just reposting LUL
[2023-01-06 14:35:14] <%Rezuul> quotetweeting doesn't really take away from the original tweet/drive traffic away from it, it's just that a retweet would have been slightly more helpful to the artist, but it's not like that's obligatory at all
[2023-01-06 14:35:17] <@%KafroHudrep> quote tweets weren't always a thing and honestly a lot of people to this day think they were a bad decision
