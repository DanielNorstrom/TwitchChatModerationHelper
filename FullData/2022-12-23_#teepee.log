[2022-12-23 15:29:43] <@%^Streamlabs> TeeP enjoys the core gameplay of WZ 2.0. Loves the look and feel of the map. TeeP prefers free loadout to be during 1st circle and more money economy on the map. Hitching/Lagging is an issue as well. TeeP loves the game so far and looks forward to quality of life improvements. TeeP does not know what the exact meta will be for the game, but the meta will probably evolve quickly as it did for WZ 1. TeeP will be using a variety of loadouts. - !guns for more info

[2022-12-23 17:38:58] <%+xjstack> I feel like the only important factor is how often you plan on changing vehicles. If you want to be in a new car every year or two then lease it... if you will keep it for a while then buy
[2022-12-23 17:39:00] <%+nviiciious> lease and turn it back when there is no more warranty. cost to fix when something goes wrong is way too high
[2022-12-23 17:39:00] <jonathon_borges> False. You can lease a car for cheaper and then roll it over into a loan. Basically buy it out after the lease.

[2022-12-23 17:41:37] <%+StingrayKBL> Yes, cash.  Cars are a huge loss once you drive them.  They depreciate and are an expense.  The only way you should finance a car is if you make money by uber, or leasing it.
[2022-12-23 17:41:37] <jaybird1_1> If the rate is 2% or less, finance and invest the extra money

[2022-12-23 17:43:31] <%Ayrawn_> Those rates are factored by many different things, credit history/age etc
[2022-12-23 17:43:32] <Crutioh> @teepee the best interest rate my dealership has been able to get for our 800+ guests is around 3.9%
[2022-12-23 17:43:32] <+FredSavageGarden> It’s based on your credit score as well I’m pretty sure… if your credit sucks your rate is going to be higher
[2022-12-23 17:43:36] <%+xjstack> The other big factor is if people are buying to cut down on tax liability. You can get huge tax incentives for buying/financing a vehicle. But you can also deduct payments on a lease.... But you can get a huge deduction for the depreciation with current tax law.
[2022-12-23 17:43:39] <$DrSaxyTime> It is ass. But I can refinance through ur bank as soon as title is in hand. Get pre approved first too.

[2022-12-23 17:44:19] <+OnTheRon> there's a thing called money factor that can be converted to an apr
[2022-12-23 17:44:22] <%dekciw11> not to mention the cash down on a lease
[2022-12-23 17:44:22] <bluemoonrise10> Don't lease
[2022-12-23 17:44:24] <+jmarv90> Leases are up $150 or more on the chevys that i sell atm
[2022-12-23 17:44:25] <+itsTacTic_> So take a loan out on your car to invest in the market that is down 20% this year. Or pay cash for a car and have free cash flow - cash is king
[2022-12-23 17:44:26] <+bugcatcherdave> imagine not buying all cash .. yikes
[2022-12-23 17:44:26] <%bullydahy3na> And if you a 700 credit score or above and you don’t get 0.9% or 1.9 you got shitted
[2022-12-23 17:44:28] <tokenstreamz> @playground_legend34 When though? Rates have doubled in the last 6 months
[2022-12-23 17:44:29] <%+bowlsd> Its called a money factor but essentially same thing
[2022-12-23 17:44:33] <%+franksiepoo> Leases have a rate built in AND profit margin for the dealer built in

[2022-12-23 17:45:35] <king0fspad322> Interest rates factor into the lease pricing also
[2022-12-23 17:45:37] <%$jake_new24> @TeePee us dealers make significantly less on leasing versus customers buying. Because we make several thousands dollars when you finance with us
[2022-12-23 17:45:39] <%superferg21> Purchase rates are amortized
[2022-12-23 17:45:40] <%+The_Ta0> Not to mention just the security of not having a payment when you own it. Flexibility about when you want to pay for something is valuable itself.
[2022-12-23 17:45:41] <+TPH1LLY> Wait 8-12 months to buy a car. The car market is crashing right now. Leases are the worst way to get a car financially. Do not lease. Buy a 2-3 year old used car. Let someone else pay the depreciation
[2022-12-23 17:45:43] <thesequence1> 8 years is a lot of milage so if it already used by the u sell it those years later it'll b worth less so sell if u buy from a brand new car

[2022-12-23 17:46:22] <%+xjstack> Teep, do you run your stream as a business, so you deduct the depreciation of the new car on your taxes? That is a big part of buying or leasing.
[2022-12-23 17:46:29] <%+tombecket1215> @jake_new24  yeah but lease returns get a higher interest rate on average when you resell them dealers do just fine
[2022-12-23 17:46:30] <fattambo> Cars aren't investments.

[2022-12-23 17:46:33] <%type_wonder> Getting a loan right now sucks, the Fed keeps raising rates so you basically can’t get anything lower than 5% right now

[2022-12-23 17:46:38] <CrazyOldBiker> I financed my truck, I have $580/month for 3 years for a 2015 RAM 4x4. Now I want to downsize, have found 1980-2007 pickups for between $2,000 and $5,00 total cash.
[2022-12-23 17:46:41] <+itsTacTic_> It’s already bad to lose money in the market when the money is yours. When you’re borrowing it on an auto loan it’s even worse
[2022-12-23 17:46:44] <TuRtleSoUPcPa> Buy a year or two old, and in cash, ez

[2022-12-23 17:46:55] <iRyanP> It really just depends on whether u want a new car every 3 years or not. If u want to own ur car. Then purchase. If u like new shit. Then lease.
