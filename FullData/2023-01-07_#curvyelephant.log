[2023-01-07 18:55:53] <+00Jabba> It’s just to monetize the fan base I think
[2023-01-07 18:56:05] <%$moeiscrazy> yeah that season was a copy essentially

[2023-01-07 18:56:23] <%Isabellaaaa> the original movies/shows are unic in their own way when you remake something you already know what is going on but with different actors and some small things changed

[2023-01-07 18:56:48] <%+BrizzyPeezy> I don't know of many remakes I like better or just the same as the original. I also think it depends on what you were exposed to first. one being Red Dawn. o like the remake better than the original, but I saw the remake first.

[2023-01-07 19:21:47] <+00Jabba> U have to stay with the team against a fed rengar
[2023-01-07 19:21:58] <Ditchol> Best thing you can do for rengar ult is be grouped up so he struggles to target one person
[2023-01-07 19:22:00] <@effeffess1> well, he shouldnt be able to pick you off as easy if you cant leave your base nakkiSmile
[2023-01-07 19:22:14] <Ditchol> @effeffess1 that too
[2023-01-07 19:22:19] <+TooRisKyOW> when he ults wait precisely 1.72 seconds then cage yourself, works everytime

[2023-01-07 19:23:30] <+00Jabba> 0 11 he can’t do much
[2023-01-07 19:23:31] <%$moeiscrazy> no thoughts, only vibes
[2023-01-07 19:23:37] <@effeffess1> no
[2023-01-07 19:23:43] <+00Jabba> No
[2023-01-07 19:23:46] <@effeffess1> it would block his snare thing
[2023-01-07 19:23:56] <+00Jabba> It’s not a spell
[2023-01-07 19:24:32] <@effeffess1> banshees not great for rango. hourglass and prays are what you need
[2023-01-07 19:24:34] <+TheScurvySickle> With Viegar its probably best to get a good armor/health item, its just finding the right one bc he will still probably delete you xD
[2023-01-07 19:24:56] <@effeffess1> hourglass and prayers*
