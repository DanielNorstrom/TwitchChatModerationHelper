[2023-01-11 15:04:34] <SLiCkJoEE> I agree
[2023-01-11 15:04:34] <$ahmedkhalidf37> but you already got rank 1 two weeks in a row so your team is good, a toty can massively upgrade your team
[2023-01-11 15:04:35] <%$crespo95> even walkout odds were too low
[2023-01-11 15:04:37] <+marty93s> People save prime mixed players pack thinking theyll pack a TOTY
