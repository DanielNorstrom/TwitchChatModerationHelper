[2022-12-27 13:06:23] <lukesmith17061990> Don’t understand the problem with gakpo. If united wanted gakpo they would of had him , it shows United pulled the plug on the deal.

[2022-12-27 13:07:42] <+NaikNikhil> However I do think MUFC would be better off signing a Felix or a no. 9

[2022-12-27 15:46:28] <+GamingShire> @mufcfan1991 prem ruined him, he's not for prem
[2022-12-27 15:46:29] <healerk27> im not a liverpool supporter but i genuinely think nunez will show up some time within the next 2 months
[2022-12-27 15:46:29] <RafaKDB> Markovic was a top player, ruined is career by moving to liverpool

[2022-12-27 15:46:44] <%billcfc> @mufcfan1991 he ruined himself lol can't score a 2 yard tap in ain't chelsea's fault 🤣
[2022-12-27 15:46:46] <Corey2053701> Nunez is good just needs to finish
[2022-12-27 15:46:46] <dagmargomes21> flopovic
[2022-12-27 15:46:47] <+zaamas54> Honestly I think he's just overthinking rn
[2022-12-27 15:46:47] <kratos_axe> nunez needs to improve his finishing only
[2022-12-27 15:46:51] <+illicit423> @mufcfan1991 chelsea didnt ruin werner he was given plenty of chances and he played well but he couldnt score
[2022-12-27 15:46:51] <drdopoo> wwatch the gakpo to liverpool video from goldbridge
[2022-12-27 15:46:52] <+smokeymcpot_99> I can’t see it, guys got no tekkers
[2022-12-27 15:46:53] <!%ma4rten> nunez career got ruined by liverpool
[2022-12-27 15:46:55] <&amb1904> for what its worth Darwin took 1 full season at benfica before he started banging in goals.
[2022-12-27 15:46:55] <%+Connel_1411> you only need to watch hima and see hes going to be a world class stricker
[2022-12-27 15:46:56] <+reepdog777> Can’t control a bowling ball
[2022-12-27 15:46:57] <+aymuni> So why compare him to haaland? He couldn’t dare wear haalands shoes
[2022-12-27 15:47:01] <+szbozh> bro why is that lw there
[2022-12-27 15:47:01] <+ProfuseBasil18> nunez will become good hes involved with everything media just hates on him as liverpool 8 times out of 10 dont mess up big signings
[2022-12-27 15:47:05] <%+Th1sSecretN1nj4> skillz said year 2 you'll get a better incling of Darwin's fit at Pool. took his 2nd year to break out at Benfica
[2022-12-27 15:47:09] <EliteEire> he averages a goal every 2 games so he's not having a bad season, could be easily a goal a game considering the chances he had @bateson87
[2022-12-27 15:47:09] <+mufcfan1991> @GamingShire i kinda agree with that .. cause some players cant cope with not haing time on the ball ..

[2022-12-27 15:47:28] <FPLElmer_YT> could have gotten Ivan Toney imo

[2022-12-27 15:47:34] <Ethan10___> Nunez has missed a few with that red vs palace too
[2022-12-27 15:47:35] <+GamingShire> @mufcfan1991 prem is toughtest league imo so not many can be good there
[2022-12-27 15:47:35] <drdopoo> do u think he should be compared to haaland
[2022-12-27 15:47:47] <+Jgrella> When Jota comes back where is he gonna play with Gakpo coming in
[2022-12-27 15:47:47] <+reepdog777> He’s knocked you out the League cup and you’re 6th because of the Peri Peri Andy Carroll
[2022-12-27 15:47:47] <gonzoneta> man city is also playing better than liverpool, thats also a reason why haaland is playng amazing
[2022-12-27 15:47:49] <+GamingShire> @mufcfan1991 Havertz is same, was good at Bayer and he's meh at chelsea

[2022-12-27 15:48:04] <%AllanScottStutter> 9 goals in 20 pistol4Cry that’s like 46 goals per 100 games
[2022-12-27 15:48:05] <@%JRyderGaming> Darwin reminds me of when depay was at united
[2022-12-27 15:48:23] <j4betz> Guys how did I just get a free Lacazette 89 rated?
[2022-12-27 15:48:29] <%+vvlad22> Nunez is so much better than haaland at everything except finishing
[2022-12-27 15:48:34] <%oDTBo> He was only compared to Haaland because it was the only comparable transfer at the time..... they're completely different players. Nunez can create his own chances, just can't finish them
[2022-12-27 15:48:43] <FPLElmer_YT> @dagmargomes21 at least he would bet on himself scoring and actually score the goals
[2022-12-27 15:48:54] <+SeeMeOnLANDfam> haaland is obviously clear but let's not forget he's got KDB giving him perfect service all game
[2022-12-27 15:48:55] <drdopoo> @j4betz thank fifa
[2022-12-27 15:48:57] <kratos_axe> @vvlad22 stop it😂
[2022-12-27 15:48:58] <RafaKDB> Felix, Nunez, Enzo, Cancelo, Ruben Dias, Bernardo Silva, Renato Sanches, Oblak, Ederson....almost a full squad from Benfica
[2022-12-27 15:49:14] <fut_tanky> I think nunez’s confidence levels are low because he’s joined a big club in the best league in the world and gets criticised for whatever he does, he just needs Tim to regain his confidence and train under these conditions, then he’ll be a star
[2022-12-27 15:49:17] <%+vvlad22> @kratos_axe ?
[2022-12-27 15:49:28] <+GamingShire> @SeeMeOnLANDfam he didnt have KDB at BVB and he was good there too

[2022-12-27 15:49:38] <%oDTBo> @vvlad22 Haaland's positioning and ability to get on the end of the ball is insane. He could play blindfolded and still hit the back of the net.
[2022-12-27 15:49:45] <+ProfuseBasil18> @kratos_axe wont lie he does do more just needs to start getting the goals

[2022-12-27 15:49:50] <kratos_axe> haaland is a beast
[2022-12-27 15:49:51] <drdopoo> ppl were saying he was gonna flop and peps system didnt suit him
[2022-12-27 15:50:01] <+foxy_lag> wtf is this song
[2022-12-27 15:50:05] <fut_tanky> @gamingshire he had sancho and reus who are creative players
[2022-12-27 15:50:15] <+smokeymcpot_99> Just logged on and got given a lacazette
[2022-12-27 15:50:16] <%+vvlad22> @oDTBo agree, 100%. but other than that, he can't do anything on the field
[2022-12-27 15:50:16] <+GamingShire> @SeeMeOnLANDfam yet you still have to be good to score.
[2022-12-27 15:50:26] <+mufcfan1991> remember sancho sent van dijk to the shops earlier on in the season .. ..
[2022-12-27 15:50:29] <+GamingShire> @fut_tanky oh LUL Sancho and Reus, forgot about the 2
[2022-12-27 15:50:35] <fut_tanky> @smokeymcpot_99 how?
[2022-12-27 15:50:54] <%oDTBo> @vvlad22 You don't need to in that team, let's not fool ourselves.
[2022-12-27 15:51:02] <%$Rocastle78> @mufcfan1991 Looks like VVD came back from the shops with Gakpo
[2022-12-27 15:51:07] <%+DG_Banditz> @mufcfan1991 you high?>
[2022-12-27 15:51:14] <xMrMojo> i think though if nunez went to city and haaland went to liverpool then the situation would be the same, i think nunez would be shining for city and haaland would be on the slow for lpool
[2022-12-27 15:51:19] <fut_tanky> @gamingshire well they did create the majority of haalands goals at dortmund
[2022-12-27 15:51:29] <RafaKDB> Darwin scored important goals for Benfica in champions league against Barcelona, Ajax and Bayern Munchen, now he cant score against low tier teams in england, and the problem is darwin? yes....keep thinking like that
[2022-12-27 15:51:31] <+mufcfan1991> @mufcfan1991 you obviously didnt see the goal then ??
