[2022-12-26 08:47:01] <@%Cetkaman> but this game felt so half assed to me, managing to get even the humor repetitive in 10 hours

[2022-12-26 08:47:36] <!%ReeEle_> Hmm
[2022-12-26 08:47:38] <!%Sscuzzy> I think it was also cause the fandom became too overbearing

[2022-12-26 11:36:41] <xenoxeno015> the asian fuks in the second game was so insufferable
[2022-12-26 11:36:41] <+wellsanin> its because people who write games can't write
[2022-12-26 11:36:42] <%$PsyFi_ZA> bad writing... They dont know how to write a good villain
[2022-12-26 11:36:43] <+SupernalArts> they ad unlikeable characters because the writers suck ass
[2022-12-26 11:36:44] <goldfish_head> and directing in general
[2022-12-26 11:36:44] <%DKennyF8> Well not Freya of Milfgard :D I liked here :D
[2022-12-26 11:36:46] <NotLongEnoughMan> they killed that one likeable dude with a split second hitshot sajj

[2022-12-26 11:36:49] <%LaryOnTwitch> Like in that Devil in Me game. Every character was absolutely punchable.
[2022-12-26 11:36:49] <!%+xined_> i guess its easier to write someone unlikable to create plot points

[2022-12-26 14:22:13] <TheZett> Auto-attack range is calculated from your hitbox's outer circle, which is 24 units, thus you have 630+24 range for auto-attacks. Starfall's range is calculated from the center of your hero, thus just 650 AoE range.

[2022-12-26 14:28:14] <!%$Entyx__> Hey guys, did you know that in terms of male human and female Pokémon breeding, Vaporeon is the most compatible Pokémon for humans? Not only are they in the field egg group, which is mostly comprised of mammals, Vaporeon are an average of 3”03’ tall and 63.9 pounds, this means they’re large enough to be able handle human dicks, and with their impressive Base Stats for HP and access to Acid Armor, you can be rough with one.
[2022-12-26 14:28:15] <LordgunHD> FLASHBANG
[2022-12-26 14:28:15] <%hazmat_he> Flashbang
[2022-12-26 14:28:15] <!%$Entyx__> Due to their mostly water based biology, there’s no doubt in my mind that an aroused Vaporeon would be incredibly wet, so wet that you could easily have sex with one for hours without getting sore. They can also learn the moves Attract, Baby-Doll Eyes, Captivate, Charm, and Tail Whip, along with not having fur to hide nipples, so it’d be incredibly easy for one to get you in the mood.
[2022-12-26 14:28:16] <!%$Entyx__> With their abilities Water Absorb and Hydration, they can easily recover from fatigue with enough water. No other Pokémon comes close to this level of compatibility. Also, fun fact, if you pull out enough, you can make your Vaporeon turn white. Vaporeon is literally built for human dick. Ungodly defense stat+high HP pool+Acid Armor means it can take cock all day, all shapes and sizes and still come for more

[2022-12-26 14:28:23] <!%$Entyx__> Umbreon also has access to the ability Synchronize, which allows it to share it's current status with you, meaning you will receive all of the pleasure it feels COMBINED with all the pleasure you're getting from pounding this perfect breedable Pokémon. Umbreon also has the capability of seeing perfectly in pitch-black darkness, allowing it to effectively attend a midnight fornication session. Even if you do manage to drain Umbreon's energy with all the furious thrusts, it can recover very quick
[2022-12-26 14:28:24] <!%$Entyx__> Umbreon can also use Taunt, in turn making you ONLY able to to attacking moves such as Slam, Pound, etc; none of that foreplay shit, right into the action. It also has access to Sleep Talk, giving it the ability to not only give consent in its sleep, allowing access to any of its ports and any time, but also move in it's sleep, making it an effective 24/7 fuckmate. Umbreon still has even more great moves that good to have while smashing, such as Quick Attack, allowing swift slams and bounces

[2022-12-26 15:05:01] <jack1tugsbayar> i think from some angles the body of the hero is just outside the spell range, but from some it steps just in. i think attack range and spell range registers the enemy body a bit differently like maybe spell has to have more than half of the body and attack range registers it as long as a part of the body is. i guess.
