[2022-12-20 08:08:37] <+No_Name_Paladin> wait is grooming streamers a thing?
[2022-12-20 08:08:46] <SilverWolfX9> sadly some people just feel socially pressured. @cozy_nero
[2022-12-20 08:08:56] <BoneMiser> the alker method
[2022-12-20 08:09:13] <%godot_was_here> as long as you're not machine gunning viewers down i don't really see the issue
[2022-12-20 08:09:15] <%snekrowave> how dare you moderate your chat batatAngy
[2022-12-20 08:09:15] <%+SleepyCorpse_> It‚Äôs your stream, ban whomever you want
[2022-12-20 08:09:15] <%SnackoRacko> nothing wrong with banning for failing the vibe check
[2022-12-20 08:09:18] <%CyOrion> It's the streamer's space, so it's fair for streamers to bop people whenever.
[2022-12-20 08:09:19] <+razorthecurse> Why would people be upset about someone being banned without warning?
[2022-12-20 08:09:22] <SilverWolfX9> Do they try to convince streamers to send pics to them for subs?
[2022-12-20 08:09:22] <BoneMiser> ye
[2022-12-20 08:09:26] <Hakuya_Yatano> I had people who flooded my stream attempting to become my mod
[2022-12-20 08:09:26] <Turret49> I'm just a bit unsure what it means they'd be doing, is it like trying to get the streamer to match your views?
[2022-12-20 08:09:33] <!%$shadychama> its your stream so if youre not comfortable it makes sense to do
[2022-12-20 08:09:40] <TheDayFlower> Ban without warning, good rule. Keep the fear of god in chat nagiquNodders
[2022-12-20 08:09:46] <+No_Name_Paladin> some people just be messed up yo
[2022-12-20 08:09:50] <%KiriKanbara> it's not grooming for subs, it's more just grooming for attention/to cater to them

[2022-12-20 08:10:17] <%CyOrion> I don't get why anyone wants to be a mod. It's a responsibility and involves work.
[2022-12-20 08:10:22] <%KiriKanbara> If you guys know what parasocial relationships are, it's that but it can get worse case by case
[2022-12-20 08:10:27] <%CyOrion> Why randos would want to be a mod, rather.

[2022-12-20 08:14:58] <%KiriKanbara> Yes Turret, its like getting attention more than others in exchange they'll draw you more art and stuff. its just an Abusive one sided relationship
[2022-12-20 08:14:59] <%Husbando_Kun> santa wouldn't groom would he?
[2022-12-20 08:15:12] <PacmanGodOfAll> clout chasing?
[2022-12-20 08:15:14] <SilverWolfX9> it's where to try to get them emotionally attached to you for a transactional purpose
[2022-12-20 08:15:25] <%KiriKanbara> ^ Silver got it
[2022-12-20 08:15:42] <%+SleepyCorpse_> Then there parasocial stuff where people think they have a much deeper relation with the person that what‚Äôs actuall happening
[2022-12-20 08:15:58] <thomas2uentin> Cable news has made the term "grooming" lose all meaning

[2022-12-20 08:18:13] <%snekrowave> It's only problematic if someone is trying to fill a need in a way that doesn't work for them. Some people can be fully satisfied with only friendships. It just depends on the person

[2022-12-20 08:18:49] <%BearEatSalmon> its completely neutral as a term, the way the internet uses it now is specifically in the sense of using it for emotional manipulation
[2022-12-20 08:18:57] <%godot_was_here> parasocial (watching christmas movies and joking together about them)
[2022-12-20 08:18:58] <+razorthecurse> Yeah, a lot of words have been twisted to mean other things over time, which is really bad.

[2022-12-20 08:19:30] <thomas2uentin> "Grooming" gets thrown around so much on social media
[2022-12-20 08:19:30] <%Zulleyy3> parasocial with streamers with readable chat is more acceptable than with bigger people. In the end it is a bit closer to being acquaintances with someone
[2022-12-20 08:19:43] <%MrFoois> a 1 sided relationship where the other person isn't aware of you except for when they regularly chat with each other

[2022-12-20 08:28:17] <+razorthecurse> I guess the point of the streams, is the viewer usually thinks it's only for them, as they chat with 10000 other people at the same time.
[2022-12-20 08:28:19] <%Zulleyy3> valid take
[2022-12-20 08:28:31] <!%$shadychama> cant do it if its someone i know, just kind of awkward

[2022-12-20 08:29:10] <Turret49> The only "GFE" I've watched is Pikamee going on a date with the viewer and having everything go wrong and the restaurant burn down
[2022-12-20 08:29:10] <%KiriKanbara> Think of it like this guys: Its an asmr and your imagining yourself in the POV while the streamer makes noises/whispers into the asmr mic to you

[2022-12-20 09:18:42] <%MrFoois> what about subathons where the timer is paused while they're asleep or away?
[2022-12-20 09:18:43] <%KiriKanbara> I gotta admit that is the #1 thing I link sleep streams to
[2022-12-20 09:18:49] <%godot_was_here> what i'm hearing is that a good subathon is one where you ONLY sleep and don't set false expectations
[2022-12-20 09:18:52] <%+SleepyCorpse_> @silverwolfx9 exactly, so many things and games I‚Äôm missing out on

[2022-12-20 09:20:16] <%KiriKanbara> Yea, it doesn't feel as honest imo when some streamers do subathons and they just put a recap vod for people to watch or just they leave for like 18hrs of the day and then "wake up" for 4 hrs

[2022-12-20 09:21:25] <%godot_was_here> public domain only
[2022-12-20 09:21:28] <Colekus> thought so
[2022-12-20 09:21:35] <%MrFoois> i like to think subathons have been memed enough that good streamers avoid the pitfalls
[2022-12-20 09:21:37] <%godot_was_here> and even then i'm not sure public domain is technically fine
[2022-12-20 09:21:38] <Foldedmetal> I always wanted to do a sleeping stream where it lasts like 36 hours and it leads up to the finale where the neighbors call the cops cause of the rotting smell and I come out with a whole new design then bury the old model
[2022-12-20 09:21:39] <%godot_was_here> but people do it

[2022-12-20 09:52:07] <marklarphd> It was weird because it felt more like a super hero show than something in the mystery genre

[2022-12-20 10:55:34] <@%KafroHudrep> clauvio is like the calculator class from FFT
[2022-12-20 10:55:35] <%Husbando_Kun> Caluvio is a minor character in a story that was well designed and you wished that they had more art or a spin off
[2022-12-20 10:55:38] <kawaiithulu> a lot of vtuber designs really would make sick rpg models though
[2022-12-20 10:55:38] <%AlphaOmega82> I like the nerd mouse

[2022-12-20 10:56:03] <%CyOrion> Have you thought of a horror themed alt model?
[2022-12-20 10:56:11] <Ateratsu> Usually 80% of the modern anime output is kinda mid or worse, and much of it is isekai, so a lot of isekais end up being trash, but it's the flavor of this anime era, as was mecha at one point, as was romcom, or slice of life, flavor of an era anime
[2022-12-20 10:56:13] <%Girutea> oh yea necromancer becaus eyou like skeletons

[2022-12-20 10:58:26] <%godot_was_here> big reason i am looking forward to baldur's gate 3 is becoming a sick ass necromancer

[2022-12-20 10:58:29] <%TheRandomPieMan> Clauvio is actually a pro FFXIV player
[2022-12-20 10:58:59] <@%+Yuushakun> Its great for sure
[2022-12-20 10:59:01] <%TheRandomPieMan> Wall to wall tanking is liberating
[2022-12-20 10:59:03] <socialistOtter> playing dps is the worst
[2022-12-20 10:59:30] <%NaelLacertus> It's really unfortunate
[2022-12-20 10:59:49] <%Colekus> its probably because some players would try to force new tanks to wall to wall pull when they didnt want to
[2022-12-20 10:59:56] <%TheRandomPieMan> WHM is brain dead but I love healing
[2022-12-20 11:00:03] <socialistOtter> dps is too solvable
[2022-12-20 11:00:26] <@%+Yuushakun> Healers have to heal/do damage/and deal with mechanics.
