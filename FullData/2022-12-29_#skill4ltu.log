[2022-12-29 00:28:43] <@%+evofrogmr> @rewoIF SU-76i is rarer, but not rarest
[2022-12-29 00:28:43] <bowler8052> Thanks for the entertaining stream!  It's time for me to play WoT !
[2022-12-29 00:28:47] <+nicolatron> I'm not native english speaker, but your "fair" sounds to me like "fear" (which is fun every time).
[2022-12-29 00:28:51] <%swtor_vatenkeist> looks like ballbreaker.
[2022-12-29 00:28:52] <%+DelHuge> @skill4ltu You mean T-44-122?
[2022-12-29 00:28:54] <%+kriskaem> its now world of tanks anymore. Its world of BZ
[2022-12-29 00:28:59] <%+kissfarkasendre> somebody knows why the french medium got removed from the tech tree? (amx 30)

[2022-12-29 00:29:26] <@%+evofrogmr> @kissfarkasendre they moved them to collector tanks instead of tech tree, mostly because there wasn't a natural branch to them
[2022-12-29 00:29:27] <+nicolatron> spanish
[2022-12-29 00:29:28] <Lexa4RU> @kissfarkasendre to make tech tree more clear
[2022-12-29 00:29:29] <%+DelHuge> I met a T-44-122 only once.
[2022-12-29 00:29:30] <MrCuddleSpeck> @kissfarkasendre They didn't know how to balance it so they just slapped it among collector tanks
[2022-12-29 00:29:30] <%thel4cky> "premium"

[2022-12-29 00:45:18] <%EpherealX> DPM is very situational though, how many times do you really get to use a tanks full DPM, only if someome is stupid enough to stand in front of you and not move
