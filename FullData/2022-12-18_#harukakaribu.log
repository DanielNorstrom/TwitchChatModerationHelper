[2022-12-18 00:44:38] <TexasLopez> Ironmouse could have won but she dislikes competition. Haruka could have won if she'd reminded the panel how much Snuffy was sneaky as hell. But it is just a game. So GG everyone!
[2022-12-18 00:44:42] <%Salculd> the best thing about the bird thing is that there was a guy on actual survivor who did almost the same thing, early in the game his tribe won some chickens as a reward and he ended up "adopting" one of them and kept him all the way up to the final tribal council

[2022-12-18 03:03:38] <%Anubis_xtx> Live stream it and when stream is over there is no cap on the saved vid
[2022-12-18 03:03:38] <%+tokidokitoky> you could just briefly end steam every 12 hours and start a new one
[2022-12-18 03:03:40] <%dominatwin> Twitch limit is 48 hours so you have to anyways
[2022-12-18 03:03:42] <%$SolitaireGEW> Wait we didn't have editors before?
[2022-12-18 03:03:44] <%sweetc00kie> i mean twitch dont allow you to make vod longer than 48h i think
[2022-12-18 03:03:44] <%Bodor_Baishin> how about restarting the stream ever 11.5 hours?
[2022-12-18 03:03:48] <KakudoKurisu> Aight, I think it's time to max out my credit cards. Let's get that time up to 500 hours.
[2022-12-18 03:03:48] <%vylesight> You would have to be next level insane to watch 16+ days of vod

[2022-12-18 03:04:25] <%shironeko8973> Could ask Mousey
[2022-12-18 03:04:26] <%$M3talloidX7> If YT is at 12 hours, maybe cap it every 12 hours? Would that ease the rendering process, Haruka?
[2022-12-18 03:04:27] <%mistreant> theoretically you could just end stream every 12 hours
[2022-12-18 03:04:27] <superiorityy6> LUL LUL LUL
[2022-12-18 03:04:28] <+DormantFlame> probably easier to restart stream after 12 hours then

It's an amazing tool that allows you to bake, fry and reheat your food and it's much safer and healthier than cooking with hot oil. It's an absolute life changer!

[2022-12-18 14:52:01] <+trenton_13570> the gameplay is better than the og mass effect
[2022-12-18 14:52:07] <Cylensio> just double checking from Aethel's reaction and oohhh boi that's a thicc timer. Kreygasm
[2022-12-18 14:52:08] <batsdarkprime> Andromeda is good as long as you don't expect it to be like the other Mass effect games.
[2022-12-18 14:52:10] <jacerknot697> I wouldn‚Äôt give Haruka a lugie, she‚Äôd probably impale you with her horns.

[2022-12-18 15:06:41] <%invaluableperson> @dpfox86 I don't think we'll be able to tell until we start getting down to a few minutes left. Rule of thumb is that the first few times it starts getting to a few hours left, chat will panic and add multiple days of subs.

[2022-12-18 15:18:23] <zhyph3r> is that 398 hours? that nuts
[2022-12-18 15:18:34] <YamJam> @zachary1234569 Sleep tight
[2022-12-18 15:18:42] <HonestVirtue> It was above 400+
[2022-12-18 15:18:50] <%+FreewayKnight> She might be waking up soon. If I'm reading the VOD right, she went to sleep about 7 hours ago
[2022-12-18 15:18:52] <%invaluableperson> @dragonfriend7738 Oh definitely. Was just clarifying that she technically did get advice.
[2022-12-18 15:18:53] <%dpfox86> Yeah but that's a perpetual timer. The sub times have been reduced since.
[2022-12-18 15:18:53] <MetsuTeras> @rithost HOLY SHIT I DIDNT NOTICE THE TIMER
[2022-12-18 15:18:55] <HonestVirtue> We didnt get the funny number Sadge
[2022-12-18 15:19:18] <MetsuTeras> @dpfox86 How much was reduced?
[2022-12-18 15:19:35] <+ThatOneMonkeyyy> I mean 5 minutes was a little overkill
[2022-12-18 15:19:37] <%dpfox86> Was 5 minutes, now 30 seconds
[2022-12-18 15:19:40] <%invaluableperson> @dpfox86 From 5 minutes per T1 sub to 30 secs
[2022-12-18 15:19:59] <Dr_J_Leon> She looks so cute! TakeNRG

[2022-12-18 15:20:13] <HonestVirtue> if Haru kept it at 5 min

[2022-12-18 15:20:41] <MetsuTeras> @HonestVirtue If she did shed be here longer then Mouse did
[2022-12-18 15:21:00] <%dpfox86> Mouse had only 60 seconds per sub though I think
[2022-12-18 15:21:01] <%ArtUniverse> 5 minutes per sub would literally mean an endless subathon. Mousey had to reduce it to 10 seconds per sub during hers
[2022-12-18 15:21:02] <%briankennedy187> out of curosity. how long did mouse last?

[2022-12-18 15:21:33] <MetsuTeras> @dpfox86 Didnt help that she got raided multiple times a day LUL
[2022-12-18 15:21:35] <HonestVirtue> it was always burning since the work been turning
[2022-12-18 15:21:50] <%scorcher117> And I think Lily's subathon was about 45 day

[2022-12-18 15:22:07] <%dpfox86> @dpfox86 Mouse is a freaking Disney princess. It would have been weird otherwise
[2022-12-18 15:22:12] <%invaluableperson> @briankennedy187 It also ended because people started playing games with the timer tryna raise it at literally the last second, until they finally messed up their sub timing and it hit zero :p

[2022-12-18 16:01:57] <%FreewayKnight> So like I got here like 45 minutes ago and she's still sleeping. Damn, she must have NEEDED it
[2022-12-18 16:02:02] <%briankennedy187> couple hrs prolly...not sure when she went to bed finally
[2022-12-18 16:02:06] <calex4427> bruh i left yesterday and went to bed and the timer was at 405
[2022-12-18 16:02:09] <Aluminum_Ape> Like most vtubers, she didn't think she'd be drowned in subs only to find out otherwise the hard way

[2022-12-18 16:02:39] <Beeefjerke> Did she bump it down to 1min now? that 5min is a bit insain haha
[2022-12-18 16:02:40] <%YunruWithATopHat> She thought her friends were just trying to encourage her, not actually warn her
[2022-12-18 16:02:42] <%FreewayKnight> I think she went to sleep at around midnight or 1am Central
[2022-12-18 16:02:44] <natewolfe23> when melody did this and she woke up it seemed like she actually woke up in her chair lol
[2022-12-18 16:02:48] <%rando93> At this point I can say good for Haruka we blasted through all her goals before I remember sub goal was 4500 LUL haruchiHeart
[2022-12-18 16:02:52] <calex4427> @Beeefjerke  30 seconds for tier 1
[2022-12-18 16:03:00] <%Finakala> She changed it already, yes
[2022-12-18 16:03:09] <%Finakala> But the timer was already at 400hrs
[2022-12-18 16:03:16] <%MetsuTeras> @Aluminum_Ape She underestimated her hard work
[2022-12-18 16:03:19] <Aluminum_Ape> 1 minute for tier 2 and 1:30 for tier 3

[2022-12-18 16:10:43] <%+DragoonSwarm> The REALLY funny bit is when the timer starts to wind down and she thinks it's going to end soon... then the subs come and she's back up to 400.
[2022-12-18 16:10:44] <%+dandotwitch> are the subs still set to 5 mins per sub?
[2022-12-18 16:10:57] <%+Fungameplayer> Does anyone know what time Timer was at when she went sleepmode?
[2022-12-18 16:11:00] <%ThatOneMonkeyyy> nope 30 sec
[2022-12-18 16:11:04] <%invaluableperson> @DragoonSwarm Happens every subathon.

[2022-12-18 16:11:48] <%+dandotwitch> I wouldn't be surprised if she needs to make it 15 secs per sub like mousey did

[2022-12-18 16:12:18] <%invaluableperson> @dandotwitch To be honest, I get the feeling she'd more likely cap before lowering it again.
[2022-12-18 16:12:19] <%Finakala> Her and Mouse are comrades in underestimating chat
[2022-12-18 16:12:27] <%YunruWithATopHat> I wonder if she'll still be in Subathon come my birthday

[2022-12-18 17:28:10] <%onigirilastfan> can we get the nuzlocke to be a randomizer and pick er starter to be a yearling
[2022-12-18 17:28:14] <%MetsuTeras> @i_m_u_3 From Gen2?
[2022-12-18 17:28:20] <%invaluableperson> @fireX_12 I didn't say in-universe they got rid of normal animals. I said that meta-wise, early lore had normal animals alongside pokemon, but the lore was retconned by the time Johto and Hoenn came about. Pokemon also used to be set in the real world with Japan, India, France, US, and such being mentioned as well.

[2022-12-18 17:28:34] <dragonfriend7738> @blueshadow230 did you know that in terms of Pokemon and human cuddling, Flareon is the most compatible due to their ability to regulate the heat they emit?  which is good, because they're terrible in battle

[2022-12-18 17:28:48] <BillNWI> @littlehelper there‚Äôs a bunch of DidYouKnow Gaming videos that explain it better, but basically the original show runner called Shudo had a ‚Äúseries bible‚Äù for the early anime. A lot of weird lore details that would have never been mentioned in the show itself.

[2022-12-18 17:51:33] <Blueshadow230> 16 days, to be exact
[2022-12-18 17:51:36] <%ShadowKeilx> 16 days of non-stop streaming will probably gain her a lot of attention and bring in new people.
[2022-12-18 17:51:42] <%thegamingkyro> @onigirilastfan true

[2022-12-18 17:52:31] <%onigirilastfan> fun fact she can't be banned while on air
[2022-12-18 17:52:34] <%thegamingkyro> before i watch LOTR i have a question.... Game of thrones or Lord of the rings?
[2022-12-18 17:52:43] <%thegamingkyro> whats better

[2022-12-18 17:53:02] <Blueshadow230> ummm LOTR has more lore
[2022-12-18 17:53:05] <dragonfriend7738> @thegamingkyro LotR is superior to Song of Ice and Fire, in my humble opinion
[2022-12-18 17:53:15] <%i_m_u_3> @thegamingkyro I would say lord of the rings is the better story, but game of thrones for seasons 1-4 is masterful writing
[2022-12-18 17:53:21] <%onigirilastfan> bur game of thrones have more oppai

[2022-12-18 17:54:22] <%thegamingkyro> lets see what i think, i've watched game of thrones and house of the dragon so im already a big game of thrones fan so it'll be interesting how i find LOTR
[2022-12-18 17:54:22] <%onigirilastfan> opai and incest on the first episode
[2022-12-18 17:54:23] <%i_m_u_3> rings of power or actual galadriel?

[2022-12-18 17:55:02] <%onigirilastfan> rings of power is not even worth being talked about

[2022-12-18 17:55:44] <%thegamingkyro> @i_m_u_3 yes but season 1 - 8 are masterpieces and house of the dragon is doing really good and is redeeming game of thrones for me

[2022-12-18 17:56:10] <%thegamingkyro> @dragonfriend7738 i think that was just his charecter and Daenerys helped him change his barbaric ways

[2022-12-18 21:08:00] <%+ATF_Iciclebar> If you want to use it as a condiment, my grandma used to make applebutter, which is basically concentrated applesauce and we'd put it on toast
[2022-12-18 21:08:00] <%ThatOneMonkeyyy> Apple sauce on pancakes works
[2022-12-18 21:08:00] <%TheFoodcartGamer> apple sauce with pork is great
