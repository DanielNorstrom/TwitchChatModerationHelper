[2023-01-08 09:51:21] <%Silvertunga> My favourite thing about eye tracking is that when it was first developed they had to add artificial lag to it. It was used to navigate on a phone and people would look at icons and sides of the screen to open apps or go to new pages. It worked so quickly at first that people freaked out thinking it read their minds because the human eye will move slightly before our conscious mind catches up :D

[2023-01-08 13:29:39] <%Silvertunga> @Jadekaiser Eh, in some myths there's some serious time dilation, but it's never that exact. Some kids hide in a cave for 7 days and come back out 180 years later. A king visits and comes out 300 years later and instantly drops dead from old age. Stuff like that, but myths are almost never exact about math.
