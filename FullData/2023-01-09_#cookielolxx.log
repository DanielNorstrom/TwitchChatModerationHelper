[2023-01-09 20:25:39] <+PapaRonnieG> @PapaRonnieG "Eight states and the District of Columbia have passed laws that completely ban automatic/assault firearms. These bans are in place in California, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and New York. The bans cover models, semiautomatic rifles, semiautomatic pistols, shotguns, and feature tests for most states and the District of Columbia. There is also a magazine capacity limit of ten. Hawaii only enforces this ban for semiautomatic pistols."
