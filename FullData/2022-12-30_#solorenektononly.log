[2022-12-30 14:06:50] <+DudeItsKaizen> Setting: Solo Renekton Only's living room. SRO is seated on the couch, streaming League of Legends as usual. Suddenly, the door bursts open and a group of robbers enters, brandishing guns and demanding valuables.
[2022-12-30 14:06:56] <+DudeItsKaizen> Robber 1: Alright buddy, hand over all your valuables!
[2022-12-30 14:07:00] <+viznu> @SoloRenektonOnly do u think GP is banworthy in diamond or not high enough pick rate
[2022-12-30 14:07:01] <+DudeItsKaizen> SRO: (calmly) Sorry guys, I don't really have any valuables to give. Just a few gaming laptops and some snacks.

[2022-12-30 14:07:14] <+DudeItsKaizen> SRO: (smirks) I'm Solo Renekton Only, the best streamer in the land.
[2022-12-30 14:07:20] <+DudeItsKaizen> Robber 3: (sarcastically) Oh great, a gamer. Just what we needed.
[2022-12-30 14:07:26] <+DudeItsKaizen> SRO: (stands up) Actually, I'm more than just a gamer. I'm a master of the Rift. And I don't take kindly to being robbed.
[2022-12-30 14:07:33] <+DudeItsKaizen> SRO charges at the robbers and a slapstick fight ensues, with SRO using his gaming skills to defeat the robbers and save the day.

[2022-12-30 14:14:46] <%LetheTheForgetfulRiver> It's so weird the way that Kench's passive ratio works, looks like Demonic+Night Harvester will get you a 13% AP ratio on your passive? Almost half a Nashor's ok

[2022-12-30 16:49:49] <+ribshack2012> minion block feels like it's been so much worse this patch to me and idk why
[2022-12-30 16:49:52] <overusedmeme27> renekton needs 2 dashes by default but if you hit the 1st the second gets extended range
[2022-12-30 16:49:59] <%+lieutenantdan416> that speech was inspirational widepeepoFat
[2022-12-30 16:50:01] <skippy1> @Ahhdudeyourdead renek is fine it's just that he's doing poorly against champs whit 20 dashes and 50 knockups
[2022-12-30 16:50:31] <vvsonnievv> Alot of players don‚Äôt like the phase if your going down go down swinging

[2022-12-30 18:00:49] <urbanedensity> To be fair you have to be very high elo to understand the true power of minions
[2022-12-30 18:00:53] <hobgobknobbins> Cannon minion is just a goon. Ranged is the mastermind. Nice

[2022-12-30 18:02:50] <%$ShooShooBanah> i remember the good ol renekton days where you could never gank him cuz he was known to 1v2
[2022-12-30 18:02:54] <%$1KingMcQ> but less dmg for 1 shot
[2022-12-30 18:02:57] <%Deryn_68> @onlyzaclol Yep

[2022-12-30 18:06:53] <+Taulsas> Thought we had 2 wins?
[2022-12-30 18:06:57] <blewst> aye SRO how come when you execute a champ with renekton it doesnt do that sound like it used too?
[2022-12-30 18:07:01] <+ynot269> do you use target champions only on dives
[2022-12-30 18:07:05] <%DaleoDaVinci> how do you bind a click?
[2022-12-30 18:07:08] <my_gf_mad_at_me> i just got a new mouse and used one of the side buttons to make champion only. its really nice
[2022-12-30 18:07:17] <%+Diegoreaper_75> u can change it to nearest to click and nearest to mouse
[2022-12-30 18:07:18] <camboozle> wowo i didnt know that i thought it was just closest to you
[2022-12-30 18:07:37] <Joppekpist> @camboozle depends on the attack move
[2022-12-30 18:07:38] <+ynot269> @my_gf_mad_at_me i should do that, i have mine toggled on Z and forget to turn it off sometimes
[2022-12-30 18:07:41] <Joppekpist> there are 2 different onees
[2022-12-30 18:07:41] <hobgobknobbins> Binding something to MMB is probably good too
[2022-12-30 18:07:47] <%+Saiyoid> Yeah I have one side button for attack champs only and the other is auto attack click
[2022-12-30 18:07:50] <zooo0m> @SoloRenektonOnly one quick question dear sir : Losers queue real or not ?
[2022-12-30 18:07:57] <Psylife1> real
[2022-12-30 18:07:58] <Joppekpist> @camboozle One attack move is closest to cursor, and the other is closest.

[2022-12-30 18:08:09] <my_gf_mad_at_me> @my_gf_mad_at_me takes a little getting used to and i dont use toggle. i use i have to hold it
[2022-12-30 18:08:20] <%+Saiyoid> How else do you intimidate the ranged minons then?
[2022-12-30 18:08:26] <%DaleoDaVinci> @camboozle how do you know which is which

[2022-12-30 18:10:24] <$BillyThewet> @Psylife1 Why do you THINK he did it?
[2022-12-30 18:10:42] <onlyzaclol> @Saiyoid mostly, but not if they're out of range
