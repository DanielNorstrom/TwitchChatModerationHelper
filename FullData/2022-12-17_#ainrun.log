[2022-12-17 05:35:40] <@%^Nightbot> The runner either has to complete a full row/column/diagonal or get the most squares on the board to win. Lockout rules prevent runners from getting squares if someone else has already got them. The run also has to be done glitchless.

[2022-12-17 08:43:08] <Bradxkillyou> Thing is the OMIT League is so reliant on the fog gate randomizer, which doesn't work quite as well in ER because of how open the game is
[2022-12-17 08:43:11] <Seph434> @Ainrun question is, are you better than Evac at Elden Ring? Kappa

[2022-12-17 08:44:23] <Bradxkillyou> They need to figure out a different way to format OMIT League matches if they wanna do ER, or they'll have to do like extremely curated segments rather than randomized
