[2023-01-10 23:48:30] <%AnagumaPaint> I've been using Edge with Ublock Origin lately
[2023-01-10 23:48:32] <%hexeddragon> Watch adds?  Nah...
[2023-01-10 23:48:40] <%+GnomeOfMalice> use ublock origin. it's way better than AdBlock and AdBlock plus
[2023-01-10 23:48:52] <%suumcuiquesic> MFW internet oligopoly.
[2023-01-10 23:48:52] <%DapperKoala2> Isn't Edge built on Chromium now?
[2023-01-10 23:48:56] <!%+maximum_meatball> @GnomeOfMalice doesn't do anything for me anymore
[2023-01-10 23:49:00] <%+seraphmichael1> @DapperKoala2 yep
[2023-01-10 23:49:05] <$smashygotwitchy> ublock + ghostery
[2023-01-10 23:49:06] <+LiquefyingLife> i need my ad blocker, ads give me eye cancer LUL
[2023-01-10 23:49:06] <%TheAdamGee> @GnomeOfMalice they're saying Chrome will eventually not support any ad blocking extensions
[2023-01-10 23:49:20] <%+morgoth000> @GnomeOfMalice they are removing all ad block extensions from chrome
[2023-01-10 23:49:43] <$smashygotwitchy> @GnomeOfMalice ads are how google makes money.
[2023-01-10 23:49:43] <%+seraphmichael1> i think pretty much most alternative browsers outside of firefox and a few others are build on chromium
[2023-01-10 23:49:46] <%+wj642> what is the invisible stringy substance coming out of her mouf?
[2023-01-10 23:49:52] <%+GnomeOfMalice> Yeah but it's Google. They backtrack so much with changes and apps iahfySynthKek

[2023-01-10 23:50:01] <moromuro> they're not targeting specifically ad block extensions. They're just collateral, nice one but still colalteral on the overall change they're doing
[2023-01-10 23:50:03] <%+morgoth000> They can only blame themselves for shilling ads bloated with viruses and malware

[2023-01-10 23:51:07] <%+seraphmichael1> @emberberryart firefox
