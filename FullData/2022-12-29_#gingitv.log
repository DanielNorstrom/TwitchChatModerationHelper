[2022-12-29 16:01:20] <%+XeroEUW> @GingiTV Scripe said a few months back after Jailer that taking criticism separates the really good players  from the best. Accepting mistakes instead of whining and just believing in strategy and learning ability is really important. Think you all do that well in Echo.

[2022-12-29 18:00:34] <+ZyxioTv> @GingiTV Its depends on Scan, Someone could scanned after Raid talents etc.
[2022-12-29 18:00:36] <spacejamk> I think HO is better with tier
[2022-12-29 18:00:37] <injos> There you can see actual builds used during key runs
[2022-12-29 18:00:37] <bornzaim> both build same output, but different playstyle
[2022-12-29 18:00:47] <%paranoiia22> Ram is just playing his own style and not the best

[2022-12-29 21:26:25] <alpocopatroleros> @eggomygriego Pick the one you want or want to make money with. The buff alchemy gets you is like a pretty small heal over time on health potion use. So not a bad choice, but not that important.
