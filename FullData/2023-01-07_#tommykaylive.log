[2023-01-07 16:37:31] <%erabohmer> In the psychoanalysis of Carl Gustav Jung, there is a concept called "shadow integration" and because Jung divides the human psyche in three layers: the ego, the personna and the shadow, what it means to integrate your shadow is to face the darkness, the most intimate, perhaps even the "evil" or rather that which you choose to hide due to social pressure and bring it to the ego or consciousness. instead of fighting his darker self, Naruto chose forgiveness, integration.

[2023-01-07 21:27:26] <%SumiNoob> @TommyKayLIVE If you load the table first, and then you can load the game. You can load it additively. Table first, then load. It's called additively. You right click on the LOTR when you have the big map loaded.
