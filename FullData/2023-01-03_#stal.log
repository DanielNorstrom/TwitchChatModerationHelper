[2023-01-03 14:36:46] <%Fronia_> pretty much yeah
[2023-01-03 14:36:48] <%TM12GB> for most things they autofill
[2023-01-03 14:36:56] <%xbawbx> they'll only be the complicated hard to remember passwords if you let the manager auto generate them for you
[2023-01-03 14:36:58] <%Fronia_> unless you save it autofill
[2023-01-03 14:37:02] <%coldsadcat> Using password manager is very troublesome, don't recommend.

[2023-01-03 17:23:28] <lycoris_fox> The problem is, in the UK at least, is that jobs are so competitive and if 10 people apply and 8 have a degree and 2 don't, they'll look at those degrees even if they have no relevence to the job
[2023-01-03 17:23:28] <%$Shalfu> If life has taught me anything is that if you wanna be successful what you need is hustling when you can, not going to uni
[2023-01-03 17:23:48] <Serphera> you can self teach you a lot of stuff, university papers are just a nice extra
[2023-01-03 17:23:51] <%Frostieblade> the thing is at the age where you have to choose whether to go to uni or not you still have no idea what youre supposed to do so often uni is the default option because what else are you going to do if youre unsure
[2023-01-03 17:23:52] <%OdinDuh> plus you learn more on the job then school at the end anyways stalalaLMAO

[2023-01-03 17:24:18] <%spellsword91> Would be better off learning about finance and the markets than getting a diploma imo

[2023-01-03 17:24:34] VIEWERS: 579
[2023-01-03 17:24:40] <Serphera> school is generally about teaching you a very broad set, so you can do anything in a field from research to private sector stuff

[2023-01-03 17:24:58] <Serphera> but it's so broad, that most of the stuff will be worthless after a few months at your job
[2023-01-03 17:25:08] <%$Shalfu> Nobody asks you for the degree paper anyway

[2023-01-03 17:25:34] <%Frostieblade> the main point of uni nowadays is networking imo if you put in the effort to network and get internships and stuff easier thats the advantage
[2023-01-03 17:25:35] <Serphera> for government jobs, yes degrees are more important
[2023-01-03 17:25:44] <%+sigmacw> i would hire a no degree active github dev over uni degree no github dev 9 times out of 10

[2023-01-03 17:41:18] <%+sigmacw> @Serphera despite popular belief, that is a non-issue because original art is not used for reproduction, so no images are actually stored in the model

[2023-01-03 18:08:39] <+Canonlecolosse> i recommend 5 multis so you are at 70 it's easy to remember
[2023-01-03 18:08:43] <%+sigmacw> if you want ayato you should pull ayato
[2023-01-03 18:08:48] <%ReizzaLyn> Ayato with Xiangling burst is amazing
[2023-01-03 18:08:55] <%+sigmacw> you'll regret it if you dont like alhaitham
[2023-01-03 18:09:05] <%+sigmacw> go watch alhaitham gameplay leaks
[2023-01-03 18:09:11] <%+sigmacw> see if you like him
[2023-01-03 18:09:24] <%Frostieblade> wait how many purchases does this account currently have if you include gifts monkaHmm
[2023-01-03 18:09:30] <%+NewfieDan> I think dendro daddys play style seems fun
[2023-01-03 18:09:40] <%ReizzaLyn> Yeah 1 handed sword
[2023-01-03 18:09:40] <+Canonlecolosse> just look at this chad drinking boba tea
[2023-01-03 18:09:40] <%$kernymi> ninja
[2023-01-03 18:09:47] <%PinNateDog> down bad stal
[2023-01-03 18:09:50] <Nomokuto> I dont knwo if i pull al haithem. he just looks liek dendro keqing - not as fun to play
[2023-01-03 18:09:51] <%+sigmacw> he is dendro keqing
[2023-01-03 18:09:56] <%ReizzaLyn> He brings out a 2nd sword on his combo
[2023-01-03 18:10:01] <%MoistHeinous> i just want his boba tea
[2023-01-03 18:10:08] <%+NewfieDan> @sigmacw only he will actually do dmg LUL
[2023-01-03 18:10:13] <%OdinDuh> Susge
[2023-01-03 18:10:17] <%+sigmacw> this is an insult to all the keqing mains
[2023-01-03 18:10:22] <%+sigmacw> take that back
[2023-01-03 18:10:25] <%ReizzaLyn> Keqing is fun but Mihoyo did her dirty with her damage
[2023-01-03 18:10:25] <%GIeaming_> @sigmacw I don't think you know how strong she is with dendro
[2023-01-03 18:10:36] <Nomokuto> Keqing need to charge attack and pushes mobs ways which is so annyoign for me KEKW

[2023-01-03 18:10:47] <+Canonlecolosse> Keqing mains have suffered until 3.0 came out, they can handle it
[2023-01-03 18:10:55] <%spellsword91> peepoNugget back with fish and chips for stal and chat
[2023-01-03 18:11:01] <%ReizzaLyn> @nomokuto She also moves backwards with every charge attack
[2023-01-03 18:11:15] <%+sigmacw> alhaitham has these mirrors, its kinda complex
[2023-01-03 18:11:24] <+Canonlecolosse> fisn & chips and Ayato
[2023-01-03 18:11:46] <%Huynim> i like physical keqing she's fun NODDERS
[2023-01-03 18:11:49] <%+sigmacw> his cons have funny names though xD
[2023-01-03 18:12:14] <%+sigmacw> it did yeah
[2023-01-03 18:12:19] <%ReizzaLyn> Yeah it did. He was too strong
[2023-01-03 18:12:22] <%+sigmacw> he is still strong tho

[2023-01-03 18:12:27] <%MoistHeinous> his damage was nerfed, then buffed, then kinda nerfed again

[2023-01-03 18:12:52] <%+NewfieDan> probably atleast a year
[2023-01-03 18:12:57] <Brruhv> Usually 5-6 montyhs'
[2023-01-03 18:13:01] <%+sigmacw> ayato will definitely take longer
[2023-01-03 18:13:06] <%+sigmacw> bc he ran 6 months ago
[2023-01-03 18:13:11] <%$kernymi> nahida is so elegant
[2023-01-03 18:13:22] <%+NewfieDan> most characters dont get reruns that often excluding archons
[2023-01-03 18:13:25] <%ReizzaLyn> Nahida so cute
[2023-01-03 18:13:32] <%$kernymi> wish there's a sword-based dancer class in FF
[2023-01-03 18:13:38] <+Canonlecolosse> also the massive destruction she brings
[2023-01-03 18:13:43] <+Canonlecolosse> Nahida is a menace
[2023-01-03 18:13:43] <%Huynim> i regret not getting her weapon FeelsBadMan
[2023-01-03 18:13:58] <%BoysAreVeryCute> you dont have THAT much self control
[2023-01-03 18:14:02] <Brruhv> Or just skip alhaitham
[2023-01-03 18:14:06] <%ReizzaLyn> @huynim Me too but I didnt have enough primos and didnt want to whale
[2023-01-03 18:14:09] <+Canonlecolosse> what are you gonna do with all of that thirst if you skip both ?
[2023-01-03 18:14:23] <Nomokuto> buy a al haithem body pillow
[2023-01-03 18:14:29] <%+sigmacw> hu tao playstyle is not for everyone
[2023-01-03 18:14:34] <%+NewfieDan> Im saving everything for Dehya but I do wish I could pull for Alhaitham
[2023-01-03 18:14:37] VIEWERS: 519

[2023-01-03 18:16:03] <%BoysAreVeryCute> idk if we know for sure the other 2
[2023-01-03 18:16:11] <Nomokuto> U got soooo many characters to build so can defiantly skip some characters ^^
[2023-01-03 18:16:20] <%PinNateDog> is the pity 90 pulls per banner or all together?
[2023-01-03 18:16:21] <%+NewfieDan> honestly I'd just pull for the character you will enjoy looking at the most LUL
[2023-01-03 18:16:27] <%+sigmacw> you would benefit from c6 sara a lot though

[2023-01-03 18:17:33] <Nomokuto> never pull for constanaltions
[2023-01-03 18:17:51] <%ReizzaLyn> Rumor is you can choose a 4star and Yaoyao is one of the choices

[2023-01-03 20:17:14] <%senybonito> I kinda feel like ganyu is a lil "outdated" in terms of playstyle
[2023-01-03 20:17:26] <%senybonito> But on release she was one of a kind KEKW
[2023-01-03 20:17:27] <Kubi_ftw> HeyGuys Hope everyone is going good. I'm new to this game and I am beginning to really like it. Any tips/tricks for a newbie? LuL
[2023-01-03 20:17:47] <%$JoshCraze> Her playstyle is all fully charged shots
[2023-01-03 20:17:52] <zokok__> @kubi_ftw play YEP
[2023-01-03 20:17:54] <mudkippus> With E, Kamisato Ayato shifts positions and enters the Takimeguri Kanka state. He will leave a watery illusion at his original location. After it is formed, the watery illusion will explode if opponents are nearby or after its duration ends, dealing AoE Hydro DMG.
[2023-01-03 20:18:10] <%+Fissie> I like Tighnari's style of charge shooting personally, 3 fast charge shots, burst then swap him out c: It's satisfying
[2023-01-03 20:18:17] <zokok__> @mudkippus that copy paste
[2023-01-03 20:18:30] <mudkippus> of course it's literally his skill description OMEGALUL
[2023-01-03 20:18:37] <%+sigmacw> after ayaka came out i feel like ganyu lost a lot of her popularity

[2023-01-03 20:18:45] <Good4TheCompany> i used ganyu a ton early on, but these days my go to bow users are yoimiya and yelan

[2023-01-03 20:23:40] <%+Fissie> tighnari charge shots are appealing to me cause they have 0.5s charge time due to his skill

[2023-01-03 20:24:17] <%+Fissie> ganyu IS really strong though, if you have a built ganyu you can easily steamroll everything

[2023-01-03 21:40:16] <%Izunaaa_> truth be told, a lot of genshin content could use some succinctness
[2023-01-03 21:40:16] <%bellcross321> look at your energy now stal

[2023-01-03 21:40:28] <%bellcross321> her burst gives alot of energy
[2023-01-03 21:40:41] <ryukinomi> Raiden E, Nahida Q, then Nahida E and Sara E perhaps...? stalalaSit
[2023-01-03 21:40:44] <%bellcross321> she can basically give you 100% uptime on bursts
[2023-01-03 21:40:46] <DokGP> hihi
[2023-01-03 21:40:46] <Good4TheCompany> raiden's e can make nahinda's hold e a sniper if both are built well too
[2023-01-03 21:40:50] <CaverionTV> Nahida already have burst up because of Raiden Q
[2023-01-03 21:40:54] <%MoistHeinous> don't you have the catch moon?
[2023-01-03 21:41:15] <%MoistHeinous> catch is the spear
[2023-01-03 21:41:21] <MrZ3n> The Catch is a free weapon you get from fishing

[2023-01-03 21:42:39] <Good4TheCompany> the catch is her 2nd best weapon after her 5* one iirc
