[2022-12-14 00:03:05] <@%Gibster99> Probably consensually

[2022-12-14 00:04:13] <@%Gibster99> Yea but you're shooting cannonballs
[2022-12-14 00:04:15] <@%Gibster99> And fighting people
[2022-12-14 00:04:40] <racoon99> It's probably because the time to kill is quite long and ships are big targets for cannons, but missing your pistol shots would be annoying
[2022-12-14 00:05:02] <@%Gibster99> There's like 0 chance they're matching you with people in EU unless it's matching cross regions in a party

[2022-12-14 20:28:55] <%Arthandir> @Arthandir For civilian, a ship indeed is defined as "a large, ocean-going vessel". The military also *tends* to go with "bigger = ship" but thats mainly because bigger ships need a captain to run the crew in regards to chain of command i guess?

[2022-12-14 22:42:08] <@%Gibster99> You search for a lost ship

[2022-12-14 22:44:18] <@%Gibster99> Yea
[2022-12-14 22:44:22] <@%Gibster99> You gotta find clues usually

[2022-12-14 22:44:43] <@%Wloos> ohhhh
[2022-12-14 22:44:43] <@%Gibster99> It's typically at the end of the trade route

[2022-12-14 23:38:15] <@%Gibster99> The clues are directing you to a captains key
[2022-12-14 23:38:18] <@%Gibster99> Not to the ship
[2022-12-14 23:38:29] <@%Gibster99> If you don't have they key
[2022-12-14 23:38:33] <@%Gibster99> The ship isn't worth looting
[2022-12-14 23:38:50] <@%Gibster99> Like a vault
[2022-12-14 23:38:53] <@%Gibster99> The clues point you to it

[2022-12-14 23:46:09] <@%Gibster99> Just go to the place it says
[2022-12-14 23:46:17] <@%Gibster99> The rest of it doesn't really matter
[2022-12-14 23:46:23] <@%Gibster99> Unless it says they talked to someone

[2022-12-14 23:51:27] <@%Gibster99> Find the ship
[2022-12-14 23:51:30] <@%Gibster99> The key fits
[2022-12-14 23:51:43] <@%Gibster99> Did they give another clue?

[2022-12-14 23:54:04] <@%Gibster99> Once I have the key I just always book it to the last island
[2022-12-14 23:54:06] <@%Gibster99> And find the seagulls
[2022-12-14 23:54:50] <@%Gibster99> No
[2022-12-14 23:54:52] <@%Gibster99> It's a door
[2022-12-14 23:55:26] <RemiDaYeen> The key apparently doesn't work if you grab the manifest first, open the captain's cabin before touching the manifest
[2022-12-14 23:56:01] VIEWERS: 110
[2022-12-14 23:56:04] <@%Gibster99> No
[2022-12-14 23:56:19] <@%Gibster99> The key isn't possible to be retrieved if you take the manifest
[2022-12-14 23:56:26] <@%Gibster99> Like the clues to find the key despawn
[2022-12-14 23:56:32] <RemiDaYeen> Oh okay, it's in that order
[2022-12-14 23:56:56] <@%Gibster99> I have found the ship
[2022-12-14 23:56:57] <@%Gibster99> And marked it
[2022-12-14 23:57:01] <@%Gibster99> Then went and found the key
[2022-12-14 23:57:07] <RemiDaYeen> I was misinformed then, but yeah, definitely find the key before the shipwreck
[2022-12-14 23:57:41] <RemiDaYeen> I was just passing by, I'll be back later, you guys have fun
[2022-12-14 23:58:01] VIEWERS: 110
[2022-12-14 23:58:51] <@%Gibster99> If the key is a side quest to retrieve
[2022-12-14 23:59:01] <@%Gibster99> You fail it if you pickup the manifest before finding the key
[2022-12-14 23:59:07] <@%Gibster99> No
[2022-12-14 23:59:09] <@%Gibster99> It's good
[2022-12-14 23:59:56] <@%Gibster99> Did you get the manifest?
