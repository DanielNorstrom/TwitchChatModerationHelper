[2022-12-17 17:57:40] <%+Frogler> @aspiringspike lost in the sauce is a great name for a series
[2022-12-17 17:57:41] <%+SugahDaddy> might be on JUND sac
[2022-12-17 17:57:43] <vizix5129> Punt is on Jund Cat oven recently
[2022-12-17 17:57:54] <Mirido> he gonna be on the jund thing
[2022-12-17 17:57:58] <%+T_Paz> Punt has been playing a ton of Sacrifice, ya
[2022-12-17 17:58:01] <%+T_Paz> NOPE
[2022-12-17 17:58:12] <rowrow_> love maindeck fulm
[2022-12-17 17:58:23] <%fourdeltavictor> Yea "Spike gets lost in the sauce" is the perfect name for the series
[2022-12-17 17:58:34] <DreamyPants> Sometimes it feels like spike just uses a RNG generator to pull 3 words from gatherer and builds a modern deck around it
[2022-12-17 17:58:40] <%SkullclampMTG> Is it an honor that half the meta is just spike decks in leagues
[2022-12-17 17:58:50] <rowrow_> "Lost sauce" implies videos/decks that never saw the light of day
[2022-12-17 17:58:54] <rowrow_> seems like a nice name
[2022-12-17 17:59:15] <%fourdeltavictor> we need to put a land on cat or beast for that
