[2023-01-07 00:04:57] <+EvenMaximus> I wish i was better at this game. the whole recoil system in this game completely kills it for me. big sadge
[2023-01-07 00:04:57] <JimmyMartin> so many tasks now its crazy

[2023-01-07 00:05:15] <%+milfguardian_empire> do you think when they add arena it would be cool to add like a 8 vs 8 or even 16 vs 16 game mode where bears fight against USEC's in a one life game mode? or is tarkov not that kind of game
[2023-01-07 00:05:41] <+Kaydin910> whats your opinions on best to worst tac headsets?
[2023-01-07 00:05:47] <%+altezza300> i think the snapshots they showed only had 3v3, right?

[2023-01-07 00:07:01] <Dmmyg> we need more stealth in eft
[2023-01-07 00:07:08] <+MustangG45> TRUE
[2023-01-07 00:07:19] <+MustangG45> stealth walk is still elephant footsteps
[2023-01-07 00:07:22] <steinyydoc> What time is this?
[2023-01-07 00:07:24] <+Sch1ndlersFist> @countryttv RIP that's the worst
[2023-01-07 00:07:31] <JimmyMartin> agreed, stealth is dead in this game nowadays PepeHands
[2023-01-07 00:07:37] <%shootlootskoot> with the new sound i def can hear below me through floors and stuff now
[2023-01-07 00:07:50] <El__Muerte> trmzTmi
[2023-01-07 00:07:51] <JimmyMartin> they should buff the perception distance back up and nerf headsets
[2023-01-07 00:07:56] <%xwatchingatworkx> you think making them only found in raid would be better and rare or remove them all together?

[2023-01-07 00:08:13] <+jamiedimon420> It really does force that constant W key movement. It kills alot of the "tactical" gameplay that drew me in in the first place
[2023-01-07 00:08:25] <%Arph3nion> ok just figured out subbing is more expensive on mobile
[2023-01-07 00:08:29] <%Arph3nion> thats kinda messed up

[2023-01-07 01:14:10] <JayBoCC2> wow has antiflying and whenever you take off on a flying mount sometimes there is desync and you get disconnected...You have to reconned and try again...  Tarkov should do the same thing and just simply detect that shit and DC them over and over instead of just trying to validate that shit in the client

[2023-01-07 20:25:11] <%+ace_poontang> probably a stupid suggestion cause I know nothing about anything...but should BSG make it so that if youre running scav with a group of friends, and one of said friends kills another scav...the whole group takes a hit to their scav karma?

[2023-01-07 21:43:00] <morphiest> chat does the "invite to party" before joining a scav raid trick actually work?
[2023-01-07 21:43:39] <%+succulenthamm> @LiquidTell I believe it is default FOV, but he is using the FOV bug. Aim down sights and hold, use the free look button and while freelooking press tab, this will lock the FOV when aiming so it doesn't do that "zoom fov" thing.

[2023-01-07 21:48:03] <%+succulenthamm> wait so just invite a random player then just join the raid before they accept?

[2023-01-07 21:48:52] <%+succulenthamm> @YungDaVinci I think klean mentioned someone passed it onto devs and perhaps they are looking into it. I think it works really good with red dot type sights and iron sights so adding it as a feature would be awesome

[2023-01-07 22:22:29] <Jedi_Jax> 936 now!!!
[2023-01-07 22:22:38] <%FollowJoe> @SirKapPeela Higher bitrate + lower resolution = less compression/pixelation in complex scenes (e.g Foliage)
[2023-01-07 22:22:44] <@%LoeVG> But 936 is goated when watching on PC
[2023-01-07 22:22:52] <+Ashann> @LoeVG Does it stutter on your chromecast for that reason?
[2023-01-07 22:23:05] <%+succulenthamm> looks worse than 1080 on my pc tbh
[2023-01-07 22:23:35] <@%LoeVG> @Ashann It goes to 480 or some shit when I watch sequisha or other streams with 936. I need to force it to 720 in order not to be grainy or pixelated.
[2023-01-07 22:24:01] <@%SpottedTango> @succulenthamm it's a balance between resolution (1080P, 720P, 936P, etc) and bitrate (the amount of video data you can stuff into a given resolution) If you don't have enough bitrate to feed your resolution, you get blocking. 936p is just optimal for twitch res.
[2023-01-07 22:24:05] <%Summerteeth> I've heard about that
[2023-01-07 22:24:08] <@%SpottedTango> sorry twitch bitrate*

[2023-01-07 22:26:02] <%millsy______> how is youtube bitrate so much better, tarkov streams look so clean on there
[2023-01-07 22:26:07] <@%LoeVG> @Ashann That's why. Streamers who stream in 1080 is no problem. But if you watch a stream in any other resolution than 720 or 1080, then force the stream on 720 before you cast it to chromecast.
[2023-01-07 22:26:14] <de_charny> there is an experiment that anyone can replicate with a powerful enough laser to prove that he moon landing was real. The astronauts left a reflector on the moon at a specific location and if you shine a laser at it the laser will bounce back. This wont happen with the regular moon surface because the laser will be reflected in an unpredictable manner and wont be focused back at earth.

[2023-01-07 23:23:38] <LabMade> @RollerMobbed I love all that "grime" rap. I bet their shows are absolutely wild
[2023-01-07 23:23:44] <ardian_se> other than the audio what else you think need to be fix on tarkov klean?

[2023-01-07 23:26:28] <%+succulenthamm> @Boone_1776 I think I found the right pattern, but I am not a bear so when I see Klean's character again, I can confirm. So far the most similar I can find; search for "Russian Mountain camo"

[2023-01-07 23:26:52] <+xPyromaniax> many smal problems Tarkov has sound simply because BSG might be 5-8 people understaffed
[2023-01-07 23:26:57] <%+moosE3knucklE> god i swear this is the worst the audio has been.. i cant even tell where people are coming from half the time. i accidently killed a player scav on a run cause i was gettin shot by a pmc and he ran in the door. lol but the pmc was on my right he was on my left all i could hear.. was like both were insid me lol

[2023-01-07 23:35:47] <%siddo__> also is it just me or does it make no sense that crouching makes less noise than slow walking? i feel like it would be 10x easier to walk quietly

[2023-01-07 23:36:50] <rEvluton_theory> everyone knows crabs are silent, therefore crouch walking is quieter
[2023-01-07 23:36:56] <%siddo__> for balancing sake they could even adjust the slow walking speed to be slower at the lowest to more match the crouchign speed

[2023-01-07 23:44:08] <%siddo__> @captmafia they might come to a hold soon though, when they are prepping for release playtests will stop i think
[2023-01-07 23:44:09] <SparkKMaster> @ShyfulDarkk It should be more rep based. Like if you want good rep with skier, your rep with the rapist will be really bad and vice versa. Anything to make "you" feel more unique is a step in the right direction I thiink

[2023-01-07 23:51:32] <@%JaxPC> ooh urgi? noice

[2023-01-07 23:51:55] <%siddo__> drip>stats all day
[2023-01-07 23:52:00] <%Booglelele> what about the handguard with the side grips?
[2023-01-07 23:52:06] <pr0z4kk> that mag is nuh uh
[2023-01-07 23:52:12] <%+succulenthamm> I've not used a pistol grip that feels any much better then another, I have a preference but it hasn't affected my shooting. Hate how things are meta, let me make aesthetic choices and not be penalized
[2023-01-07 23:52:13] <SparkKMaster> I rather loose some recoil control/ergo or whatever as long as the gun is drip
[2023-01-07 23:52:20] <fr0sturbuns> riser
[2023-01-07 23:52:25] <aranzaboi> looks dope besides the mag, there are light brown mags
[2023-01-07 23:52:25] <%+rchambers4990> That rifle look dope
