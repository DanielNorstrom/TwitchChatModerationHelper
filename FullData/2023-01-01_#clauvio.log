[2023-01-01 12:27:22] <%Husbando_Kun> for guys if something is in the toilet it becomes a target
[2023-01-01 12:27:36] <NeenerWiener> There actually is a thing some guys do where people try to pee for as far a distance as they can.
[2023-01-01 12:27:39] <%godot_was_here> if you can't aim at a fly with pee from 20 paces you are not a man
[2023-01-01 12:27:41] <JunkRamen> it is thanks to the practice of sharpshooting that urinals are clean and viable areas to wash your hands in
