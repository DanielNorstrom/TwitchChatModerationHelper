[2022-12-28 06:31:59] <%WilliamFlagg> crashes do count
[2022-12-28 06:32:05] <Naicii> Well you might have saved and exited/crashed
[2022-12-28 06:32:17] <%+alainpbat> it counts everytime you open it via steam iirc?
[2022-12-28 06:32:26] <%Nifty255> My guess is Mod Restarts don't count because it's the game relaunching itself, not Steam launching it.

[2022-12-28 07:41:43] <milchbube12> you make that poudr from the crimson mushrooms

[2022-12-28 07:41:56] <%Omnipotent_0> Oh wow, Magicka was an interesting game too. Was not a huge fan of the spell casting but the story was pretty funny
[2022-12-28 07:42:09] <%Naicii> @DunkOrSlam You can make a pickaxe now that can mine the crimson blocks with tissue samples
[2022-12-28 07:42:10] <%Omnipotent_0> Didn't see that series but I'm sure it was good

[2022-12-28 07:46:21] <%myndzi> spotify's coverage has improved a bit it seems... spent the last hour + adding random songs from bands i like to a shuffle playlist. i feel like i have poor coverage but it's up past 100 songs already lol
[2022-12-28 07:46:23] <%Naicii> I'm fairly sure all pre-hm boss summons are at an altar except WoF
[2022-12-28 07:46:39] <%myndzi> i can definitely tell when i stopped listening to music so actively, newer stuff i don't know what songs to pick - or don't know the names of songs etc
[2022-12-28 07:46:47] <%Flupperich> and 6 lenses, please

[2022-12-28 07:49:33] <milchbube12> !yes
[2022-12-28 07:49:39] <%Flupperich> Yes
[2022-12-28 07:49:41] <%Flupperich> reskinned hearts
[2022-12-28 07:49:52] <%Naicii> Christmas themed
[2022-12-28 07:49:56] <%Omnipotent_0> Yup
[2022-12-28 07:49:59] <%VirtualButt_> because PADORUPADORU
[2022-12-28 07:50:02] <xezocr> Ay can I play with you? I’m lonely brodey,
[2022-12-28 07:50:02] <%Naicii> They won't drop hearts if you aren't damaged though
[2022-12-28 07:50:03] <%Flupperich> You could, but it takes a while
[2022-12-28 07:50:11] <%+quail_says_hi> since the spine and eye are both non-consumable, you can summon both of those bosses as much as you like @DunkOrSlam
[2022-12-28 07:50:25] <scarlac> you need to be low health/lower
[2022-12-28 07:50:29] <%Omnipotent_0> What Naicii said, they only drop hearts if you are missing HP
[2022-12-28 07:50:29] <scarlac> then they seem to drop
[2022-12-28 07:50:31] <xezocr> Danget your good man.
[2022-12-28 07:50:34] <%smily277353> !yes
[2022-12-28 07:50:36] <milchbube12> i think they only drop when you need health like the mana stars
[2022-12-28 07:50:38] <%Flupperich> Hearts etc. only drop when you have missing health
[2022-12-28 07:50:38] <Vexilus_> @DunkOrSlam read my narrow victory
[2022-12-28 07:50:42] <%+Andestrious> hearts only drop when you are below max hp
[2022-12-28 07:51:12] <xezocr> Cus we can do calamity together aI have it aswell.

[2022-12-28 07:52:05] <%Flupperich> if you find Heart Statues in the world, pick them up.
[2022-12-28 07:52:14] <%Naicii> @quail_says_hi since it took him 2 months for regular terraria with 1 sesh a week
[2022-12-28 07:52:16] <%Naicii> About 5 months
[2022-12-28 07:52:17] <%VirtualButt_> Or you could just kill an easy boss
[2022-12-28 07:52:22] <%Flupperich> You can construct heart dispensers with Wire once you get the mechanic

[2022-12-28 09:06:30] <%WaxNumen> I might give Terraria another try with magic storage Hmm I played a bit but got sick of inventory management simulator
[2022-12-28 09:06:44] <gamingmoments53> are you going melee cuz it looks like it
[2022-12-28 09:06:52] <%+Razrquine> !lastshop
[2022-12-28 09:06:53] <Smetanol_> yeah. super storage is great. crafting magic loot is against the idea of exploration which Terraria is all about

[2022-12-28 09:07:03] <%Naicii> @gamingmoments53 He's not restricting himself to a class at the moment
[2022-12-28 09:07:06] <%Flupperich> Just be aware that tmodloader isn't using 1.4.4 yet, so the QoL updates from that aren't there yet @WaxNumen
[2022-12-28 09:07:18] <%+quail_says_hi> with hell weapons perferators should be signifigantly easier
[2022-12-28 09:07:19] <gamingmoments53> oh he has mostly melee weapons in there
[2022-12-28 09:07:24] <%BarbleBapkins> Is three any reason to believe that this is NOT just 2D minecraft?
[2022-12-28 09:07:28] <%92ndBearCavalry> you can't craft mirror in vanilla
[2022-12-28 09:07:32] <%BarbleBapkins> *there
[2022-12-28 09:07:35] <Smetanol_> well, I mean that it's very unlikely to get into vanilla
[2022-12-28 09:07:39] VIEWERS: 480
[2022-12-28 09:07:39] <Makkenr96> yeah if you dont sort chests in vanilla Terraria your experiance is going to go bad pretty quick
[2022-12-28 09:07:41] <gamingmoments53> there are like 20 bosses
[2022-12-28 09:07:42] <mr_rivers> IIRC this is the point where the lava immunity potion and being able to breathe under lava helps a ton because you can dodge most of the enemies
[2022-12-28 09:07:44] <%Naicii> @quail_says_hi I think all he needs is a stealth meter and the ashen stalactite for perf
[2022-12-28 09:07:46] <gamingmoments53> minecraft has like 3
[2022-12-28 09:07:50] <Firerage123> @BarbleBapkins minecrfaft have no combat
[2022-12-28 09:07:55] <%WaxNumen> @BarbleBapkins Yeah, main difference being this game is pretty good and Minecraft is shit dnkAnime
[2022-12-28 09:07:58] <%Flupperich> Dont forget that water evaporates in hell
[2022-12-28 09:08:11] <%Flupperich> Just throw bombs in the lava to mine the last bit and drain the lava
[2022-12-28 09:08:14] <%+quail_says_hi> @Naicii  ooo yes seeing dunk utilizing the stealth meters would be cool
[2022-12-28 09:08:17] <gamingmoments53> minecraft isnt bad i just like terraria better
[2022-12-28 09:08:17] <%BarbleBapkins> lol! Fair :)
[2022-12-28 09:08:17] <%poissmees> lava immunity also is a drop in hell
[2022-12-28 09:08:20] <%92ndBearCavalry> Make sure you leave all the chest on the ground so you have a nice surprise later
[2022-12-28 09:08:42] <soquik> hellstone spawns lava
[2022-12-28 09:08:47] <Makkenr96> there wouldnt be a terraria without minecraft
[2022-12-28 09:08:50] <%+quail_says_hi> i agree with naicii you should get an ashen stalagtite i think it drops from imps
[2022-12-28 09:09:06] <%555entropy> youll see the dolls hanging in their feet
[2022-12-28 09:09:10] <Firerage123> @Makkenr96 there would not be anything without pong

[2022-12-28 09:18:40] <%+Razrquine> The Stars Above mod adds a bunch of popular video game weapons and anime weapons too. Adds a lot of variety to how you use weapons and even has some features that specifically work with Calamity. I really enjoyed my own modded playthrough with that mod along with calamity
[2022-12-28 09:18:40] <%Naicii> by the way you deposited that 2nd eye of cthulu bag you got a while back

I had some quality time with my family. For some reason my mom decided that lasagna was going to be the xams meal, but it was really delicious.]

[2022-12-28 09:52:01] <%Naicii> which summons it

[2022-12-28 11:14:08] <%Naicii> Now back to my point. the bloody worm tooth is a good accessory to use

[2022-12-28 11:14:48] <%+quail_says_hi> also, craft a skymill, you cant make aerialite stuff without a skymill

[2022-12-28 11:17:25] <%+quail_says_hi> that means you can drop the acrobatics pack, and once again as Naicii said, put on the worm tooth lol
[2022-12-28 11:17:28] <%X2Creosote> still not worth it dmg wise
[2022-12-28 11:17:49] <%Naicii> @quail_says_hi Acrobatics pack is still great for horizontal mobility, but I agree, dunk never uses it so drop it
[2022-12-28 11:18:05] <%Viddaric> @DunkOrSlam Hey, have you ever seen Mike Burnfire and Zach Hazard on Youtube?

[2022-12-28 11:19:40] <%Pandora1201> you can take off the brick layer for something else too
[2022-12-28 11:19:46] <%Pandora1201> or chisel
[2022-12-28 11:19:47] <%+quail_says_hi> buying a worm scard would be good

[2022-12-28 11:19:56] <%+quail_says_hi> i think from  the dryad?

[2022-12-28 11:20:08] <%+quail_says_hi> oh damn i guess not
[2022-12-28 11:20:09] <%Naicii> o
[2022-12-28 11:20:11] <%X2Creosote> since he has balloons and can upgrade his boots, he can reforge some stuff to movement speed and use slime mount or hook to gain vertical mobility. I still think molten is better
[2022-12-28 11:20:11] <%Naicii> Worm scord
[2022-12-28 11:20:14] <%Naicii> Maybe you can

[2022-12-28 11:35:42] <%Loopyluke> the draedon stuff feels out of place

If you go to the sky and check the adjacent planets by the big one theres a good chance there will be a jungle planet with a queen bee larva inside. either that or just craft the spawn

[2022-12-28 12:04:25] <%Flupperich> The only bad thing about the spawn in 1.4.3 WITHOUT calamity would be that there was a finite amount of hive
[2022-12-28 12:04:34] <%truuuuuuck> Compared to the usual shit you’d have to fight the queen bee anyway
[2022-12-28 12:04:45] <%Flupperich> but Calamity solves that by making the summon not consume. 1.4.4 fixes it with Shimmer letting you craft hive
