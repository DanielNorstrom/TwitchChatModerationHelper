[2022-12-31 09:16:34] <hobrev> gen4 is considered old school

[2022-12-31 09:17:57] <hobrev> TCG2 isnt as good, the AI blatantly cheats in that one :D

[2022-12-31 09:21:53] <hobrev> I think it triggers the post-game thing where you can get the other fossil, but thats postgame
[2022-12-31 09:21:57] <%ShadoeHarshaw> you get the other fossil after e4
[2022-12-31 09:22:12] <+michaelchany> @shin_bacon Emerald is a great enhancement over R/S

[2022-12-31 10:33:54] <%drakeirving> it's because they would have programmed the effect already to have the 30% flinch chance from stomp, then copypasted the effect to the other moves without thinking about the extra minimize effect

[2022-12-31 10:41:41] VIEWERS: 584
[2022-12-31 10:41:52] <M000GLE> HGSS you have to beat Red to win Kaizo
[2022-12-31 10:41:53] <+Happy__Kitty> honestly it feels more like forest fort
[2022-12-31 10:42:01] <+XenionGaming> I love gen 2 and the remakes. My favorite games.
[2022-12-31 10:42:33] <212mochaman> i love how the painful areas in emerald change depending on format. any% = random 2 mon npc with roselia. EK = magma hideout. This = lab fight

[2022-12-31 11:50:41] <%Thalant_> It's gotta be tough on dungeons and gyms where you can't heal the water spout PP
[2022-12-31 11:51:15] <%Kailaria> it might be..?
[2022-12-31 11:51:17] <CarshTV> It is
[2022-12-31 11:51:21] <hobrev> it is
[2022-12-31 11:51:21] <%Rootballa> it should be, it's got battles
[2022-12-31 11:51:23] <Nyancy_Cat> it's a building w trainers
[2022-12-31 11:51:23] <hobrev> a small one
[2022-12-31 11:51:25] <%LumPhoenix> Is the bed illegal?
[2022-12-31 11:51:27] <RiveasVii> if it has traineres yes

[2022-12-31 11:52:06] <CarshTV> It doesnt change anything
[2022-12-31 11:52:08] <%Kailaria> its so snugglable
[2022-12-31 11:52:12] <CarshTV> So shouldnt be a problem
[2022-12-31 11:52:20] <%Rootballa> i think people heal there once they've done the story because it is a pokecenter analogue
[2022-12-31 11:52:29] <%moist1110> so snugglable
[2022-12-31 11:52:51] <$UTDZac> Aye, you can use the bed conditionally. Cases like being poisoned you can't
[2022-12-31 11:52:54] <%Lord_Granwyrm> Spirit of the rules, i say it's fine
[2022-12-31 11:53:00] <%Lord_Granwyrm> not that my opinion matters
[2022-12-31 11:53:33] <hobrev> this run is already a bit scuffed with the accidental refight

[2022-12-31 11:54:19] <thelargeone> unless it's a W it won't matter anyway
[2022-12-31 11:54:32] <%LumPhoenix> It'll be awkward if it is a W though
[2022-12-31 11:54:48] <%Kailaria> yea, he was just trying to surf
[2022-12-31 11:54:54] <%Kailaria> and he's made up for it

[2022-12-31 11:55:29] <M000GLE> STONKS
[2022-12-31 11:55:30] <%+cb_longneck> yeah its really no biggie
[2022-12-31 11:55:34] <%EntropicEnder> It doesn't matter at all, the rules are an arbitrary set of constraints that we chose to impose.
[2022-12-31 11:55:39] <%drakeirving> omg it's wailord if you beat this you win!!!!
[2022-12-31 11:55:45] <%+cb_longneck> lol
[2022-12-31 11:55:47] <%drakeirving> holy shit gg
[2022-12-31 11:55:48] <hobrev> indeed, my point was more to the effect that if someone actually wants to be an asshole about it they can, so using the bed in there now isnt that a big a deal, if you keep to the spirit of the challenge
[2022-12-31 11:55:55] <%LumPhoenix> I suppose it depends on whether you see it as a personal challenge or a leaderboard kind of thing.

[2022-12-31 11:57:53] <%2pert> Oh shit
[2022-12-31 11:57:56] <Nyancy_Cat> i think what they mean is there's a basically set gym order, whereas in frlg you technically have options

[2022-12-31 12:02:29] <%Kailaria> I dunno, like, granted, Surf opens the world up a fair bit, and there's a lot of revisits to places, but every place that opens up is a step up in levels, unlike yea, in R/B/FR/LG, where you have two paths to Fucshia that aren't really all that high level in the grand scheme of things

[2022-12-31 12:04:34] <%LumPhoenix> There's no logical difference. Either the run is already invalidated or it isn't.
[2022-12-31 12:04:45] <justcallmecore> I don't know much about this game. Is this current PB since starting?

[2022-12-31 12:05:08] <%Kailaria> couldn't do that at Mauville cuz you'd have to surf over here
[2022-12-31 12:05:11] <CarshTV> U wouldnt be able to go without it
[2022-12-31 12:05:13] <%LumPhoenix> You can't deposit HM friends because you need Surf to get here, no?
[2022-12-31 12:05:18] <Lightorias> yeah you can for sure use it unless you are poisoned basically
[2022-12-31 12:05:30] <+Buglaux> It's not 2023 quite yet here but I can tell things are already very different compared to last year. Then again it MIGHT be that I'm in Japan now and last year I was in Europe buglauT

[2022-12-31 12:08:50] <%LumPhoenix> Personally I think it's against the spirit of the rules. Not that it'll wind up mattering.

[2022-12-31 13:09:26] <EmericusT> I guess the reason I ask is because I know lots of Kaizo runners have to reset loads of times, so I would've thought they'd like to get back to where they were ASAP. But wanting it for the looks is fine too :P
