[2022-12-22 15:22:59] <Kavris_Ragehoof> Muspelheim was one of the primordial realms, the realm of the fire giants. When Ragnarok comes, Surtr, king of Muspelheim, will light all the realms on fire because Freyr traded his magic sword for help to woo a giantess.
[2022-12-22 15:23:22] <Jackowillson> woo?

[2022-12-22 15:24:09] <Kavris_Ragehoof> Depends on the myth.

[2022-12-22 15:25:31] <Kavris_Ragehoof> Thor's mother was 'the earth giant' or personified land. Likely the reason his portfolio included being god of fertility and hallowing land.
