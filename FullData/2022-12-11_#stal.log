[2022-12-11 13:01:39] <%spellsword91> I have always been kind of skeptical about digital art in general and this ai stuff is kinda validating that
[2022-12-11 13:02:09] <Resuta_Ri> but how are these people joining an artist stream or something just to say THAT?
[2022-12-11 13:02:09] <Yinyhn> the thing is, traditional art can also be replicated by ai, right?

[2022-12-11 13:10:21] <!%SateLight_ed> my opinion of AI art is... a double-edged sword... for the company it helps them to train their AI more into Machine Learning and Computer Vision, but because it's basically open to the public, and basically free, it's being used by ppl for their own good, and obviously ruins artists who worked so hard

[2022-12-11 13:11:39] <!%SateLight_ed> All of this thing is because of data-mined sources like pixiv, etc2 and it uses all of those images, turned it into dataset and learn from it. It's basically "stealing", yes. But that's the thing that AI engineers do, sadly. Sometimes they ask for permissions, sometimes they don't

[2022-12-11 13:41:18] <%marcus2136> Imo

[2022-12-11 13:41:58] <%HalCynical> Ill be real, just try the free trial, if it feels slow, its not worth for u
[2022-12-11 13:42:04] <Xyraeus> hmmm i play dragon nest too
[2022-12-11 13:42:07] <%marcus2136> Pso2 og has a lot of content like idk what to do but ff14 is a bit more clear

[2022-12-11 13:46:29] <%epherians> Open world events like hunts and world bosses are what ppl will gather for

[2022-12-11 13:46:34] <Xyraeus> hmm interesting, i rmb perfect world is dungeon and instances and open world mobs
[2022-12-11 13:46:41] <%$kernymi> i love to read NODDERS
[2022-12-11 13:46:45] <Xyraeus> if this game is like that should be fine for me
[2022-12-11 13:46:46] <%Mista_Pink> I do feel it is worth killing mobs for exp but only for the first like...5 or 6 levels if even

[2022-12-11 14:00:30] <%Mista_Pink> We ALL gave this game too much money
[2022-12-11 14:00:34] <%xbawbx> my favorite one is that you can hold ctrl on the map to access the aetheryte when the map has too much stuff on it and the aetheryte gets blocked.
[2022-12-11 14:00:37] <Resuta_Ri> also the holding down ctrl with map open, it will make the aetheryte show on top
[2022-12-11 14:00:41] <+MezameTV> A&W Curly Fries + Coney Dog yesssss
[2022-12-11 14:00:47] <%HalCynical> Check Control Settings
