[2022-12-21 16:40:12] <%+storocharg> i got from twitch
[2022-12-21 16:40:20] <%0scarino_> Yes very, usually dont get notified
[2022-12-21 16:40:22] <+campo_o> is Essence Reaver good on Xayah?
[2022-12-21 16:40:27] <+zachmarty> @dessyplayer yes i play diana jungle, got to plat 4 with her recently. Shes good mid too
[2022-12-21 16:40:29] <dangerfishyfn> how to kite  better?
[2022-12-21 16:40:37] <%BabyNevi> when do you go ER on Xayah?
[2022-12-21 16:40:40] <vanhieunguyen21> HUH

[2022-12-21 16:40:49] <functionalproton> Isn’t shelly female
[2022-12-21 16:41:02] <dessyplayer> @dessyplayer nilah kinda plays like her but you need to hit q for the aa emp
[2022-12-21 16:41:05] <@dimixmt> Navori is much better on Xayah as you don't really auto much for the Auto damage, but for the feathers, so having less E cooldown is really good

[2022-12-21 16:41:52] <@dimixmt> @BabyNevi Personally I never build it, don't see it proc enough on Xayah and even when it does it feels useless. You are supposed to really only build it as a second item, but PD/RFC are much better options, collector too.
[2022-12-21 16:41:56] <dessyplayer> @dimixmt xayah is an adc mage change my mind or ig ability baised more so that the actually hyper carries like vayne kog jinx

[2022-12-21 16:44:55] <@dimixmt> @BabyNevi You can build it, it's not like it's a worthless item, but considering you pretty much need to go it as a 2nd item it's just not worth over other ones. Even collector is meh on her, but it works better than IE from my testing

[2022-12-21 17:09:23] <ustiencelleuw> @paullii__ i boost my friends from bronze to plat on adc and I use karthus / draven / caitlyn
[2022-12-21 17:09:25] <%+toyatodorokikun> we want to chain syndra
[2022-12-21 17:09:33] <ustiencelleuw> that is NOT an advertisement sorry for typing it
[2022-12-21 17:09:36] <+zachmarty> @paullii__ whatveer you find to be the most fun. Knowing your champion in and out is better so you can focus on macro and micro skills. rather than thikning about what your champ does
[2022-12-21 17:09:37] <dessyplayer> dirk first tiem cus dmg goes brr for just 1100 which is less than noonquiver
[2022-12-21 17:09:41] <+Wampleii> How do you fight Mundo as a Cait?
[2022-12-21 17:09:45] <+Londuka> @paullii__ i would play something with relatively easy skillsets, like mf for example
[2022-12-21 17:09:54] <fudzjr> im a supp main so i cant explore any rolea
[2022-12-21 17:09:59] <jnation2019> why ldr over blood? is it just for lee even though blood helps with other 4?

[2022-12-21 17:11:10] <OmentheGoat> @Wampleii cant 1v1 him. adcs shouldnt be able to 1v1 every champ either. he is one of them
[2022-12-21 17:11:31] <ustiencelleuw> @Wampleii Vayne can 1v1 him, Aphelios can 1v1 him

[2022-12-21 17:52:40] <dessyplayer> @shadowkek__ some things like samira r for the dot its nice with or just going dirk early for the dmg spike to snoball is nice but ya p much if every1 is late game an adc with 0 armor items takes more dmg from ldr than collecter because 100 base armor is a ton where people have about 60-80 mr so full ap pen builds are just better even without void AND lethality scales since its like 60% value at lvl 1 or something

[2022-12-21 17:58:05] <dessyplayer> @shadowkek__ i mean adc gets oneshot but eveerything and as a role for an rpg you just dodge all enemies and kill them with dps but bruisers are ment to 1v5 hordes while not even looking at the game tho in pvp if bruisers are balenced they arnt balenced fr then tanks need to do some dmg or they useless but they still dont take dmg so tanks are just lower dmg bruisers but if bruisers can oneshot what does that say about tanks

[2022-12-21 18:46:32] <+blacksteve> adc needs supports. adc needs team. supports don't need anyone.

[2022-12-21 19:51:10] <+aer0muffin> pretty good
[2022-12-21 19:51:11] <%shiorishay> adc is like 3/5 rn
[2022-12-21 19:51:12] <%darkyho> Mid
[2022-12-21 19:51:14] <1saacccc_> its okay

[2022-12-21 19:51:18] <mrhayaghi> mundo bro
[2022-12-21 19:51:18] <fortuity1> way weaker than last season, but still fine
[2022-12-21 19:51:18] <xocnil> scales slower than other roles, good late game
[2022-12-21 19:51:19] <senpa1vlad> ADC IS TOO WEAK
[2022-12-21 19:51:21] <%+blacklhand> ldr buff next patch
[2022-12-21 19:51:21] <senpa1vlad> bro
[2022-12-21 19:51:22] <NorwoodTheRonin> brusiers just one shot you all day long
[2022-12-21 19:51:23] <1saacccc_> not great but not dogshit
[2022-12-21 19:51:24] <VertigosFreefall> you're able to live longer than you could have, but yeah the tanks make it hard to do anything
[2022-12-21 19:51:25] <%lerf0> its only good if the enemy plays it Kapp
[2022-12-21 19:51:26] <+CabanasCN> 0/8 bruiser kills 13/2 adc, not the other way
[2022-12-21 19:51:27] <+Spectre_FPTS> ADC isn't bad, other classes are just super op
[2022-12-21 19:51:27] <%sawnikas> shit if you have no iq to correctly postiion yourself
[2022-12-21 19:51:29] <+TKDM1> ADC is shit if top hard stpoms. Otherwise good
[2022-12-21 19:51:29] <kingheracross8923> not weak but not insane, its in that middle ground
[2022-12-21 19:51:31] <+chasebullock7> i saw this dude at the liquor store last week
[2022-12-21 19:51:33] <Paschcal_The_Brain> op

[2022-12-21 19:51:41] <+MAGIKARPox> I think its ok but i don't like top lane  deciding half my items
[2022-12-21 19:51:44] <%+ViperAGJ> btw xayah i think is underrated what u think
[2022-12-21 19:51:45] <Racerbrother> I think ADC should get all XP and supp get no XP so you can scale well :D
[2022-12-21 19:51:47] <+CabanasCN> LUL
[2022-12-21 19:51:48] <AustynFound> adc just boring rn
[2022-12-21 19:51:53] <Racerbrother> SUPP gap
[2022-12-21 19:52:00] <senpa1vlad> you cant kill mundo even if youre like 10/0
[2022-12-21 19:52:01] <+CabanasCN> True. U have no impact until 3 items
[2022-12-21 19:52:02] <+Nostram> Change Grievous Wounds back to 60% and im good
