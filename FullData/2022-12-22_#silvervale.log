[2022-12-22 07:56:22] <Glimmereyes> the different obelisks have different effects. Some randomly drop rare materials. Other's must kill enemies to drop the rare mats
[2022-12-22 07:56:23] <Minielvan> the pillars give bonus fishing/mining loot if you kill the affected infested using operator or mech. the 'effect' varies by pillar based on the icon. some are hard to make work, some like vome are easy
[2022-12-22 07:56:25] <muskalicarto> what is your ign to join? it kept telling me the username doesnt exist earlier
