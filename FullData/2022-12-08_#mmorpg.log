[2022-12-08 15:21:26] <fwapdokopjai> clog after pets?
[2022-12-08 15:21:32] <%Sozan> People have been asking you that question for years lol
[2022-12-08 15:21:38] <@%$Neflii> ok but what did he say
[2022-12-08 15:21:43] <%Sozan> The items never end :)
[2022-12-08 15:21:47] <Keksbaer> @Bjorndt and bc of that less people go into the wildy
[2022-12-08 15:21:49] <+Bjorndt> But where does the term "wildy = dead" come from? @Keksbaer
[2022-12-08 15:21:56] <+Bjorndt> Ah like that

[2022-12-08 15:22:14] <Hambavahe> when 200m on every skill ?
[2022-12-08 15:22:18] <Keksbaer> @Bjorndt pkers legit would kill you while youre just doing a clue and have no items with you
[2022-12-08 15:22:26] <+Bjorndt> Still don't know how Curtis got to farm all the wildy pets tho
[2022-12-08 15:22:27] <+sniperpotion> Whats the rumor for Saturdays announcement??
[2022-12-08 15:22:39] <+Bjorndt> That's not the point I try to make @Keksbaer
[2022-12-08 15:22:46] <Kylerb16> Pet hunt or just need more brews?
[2022-12-08 15:22:48] <+Bjorndt> It's about the activity
[2022-12-08 15:22:55] <%$itsgunz4hire> a skill!
[2022-12-08 15:22:56] <h1n1slayer> bro i Just maxed on tuesday......
[2022-12-08 15:22:58] <%$itsgunz4hire> that would be time
[2022-12-08 15:23:05] <+Finitism> what do you do for bulk toadflax herbs?
[2022-12-08 15:23:06] <+wetliss> A skill would be dope. Will it pass a poll though :(
[2022-12-08 15:23:07] <$peakysy> I think Sailing would be a good skill low key despite the memes
[2022-12-08 15:23:12] <Mr_Boggins> if it's a skill what would happen with people who have max cape?
[2022-12-08 15:23:13] <h1n1slayer> no new skills
[2022-12-08 15:23:22] <%bigdaddyandyv2> I dont get how one would level up a sailing skill....
[2022-12-08 15:23:30] <+tOudWijf> hahah xD
[2022-12-08 15:23:31] <TheTailbone> I hope a new skill makes its way in
[2022-12-08 15:23:33] <+DeshCreator1> YES DIVINIATION
[2022-12-08 15:23:37] <%Turnpikes> Just because they announce it doesnt mean itll be out anytime soon lol
[2022-12-08 15:23:40] <Keksbaer> osrs needs a new skill tbf
[2022-12-08 15:23:40] <+nahTiQ> SAILING CONFIRMED
[2022-12-08 15:23:44] <%Sozan> I would have to spam that new skill... I would miss my max cape so much LUL
[2022-12-08 15:23:55] <kfczingercombo> sailing should just be dungeoneering with random islands to explore
[2022-12-08 15:24:00] <@%$Neflii> ok but what would the new skill be tho
[2022-12-08 15:24:01] VIEWERS: 921
[2022-12-08 15:24:04] <+sniperpotion> Is dragon slayer 2 aids?
[2022-12-08 15:24:07] <+chopperr_> ill hopefully be close to max by the time a new skill came out
[2022-12-08 15:24:14] <WATCHMECARRYLOL> when does the new imbued heart quest come out?

[2022-12-08 15:25:12] <Keksbaer> @Neflii any new skill after summoning in rs3 is trash
[2022-12-08 15:25:13] <WatchWaterboy> Monkey Madness 2 sucks and I was worried about DS2 but it might be one of the best quests in the game
[2022-12-08 15:25:17] <%$itsgunz4hire> story wise mortanyia story is the best
[2022-12-08 15:25:28] <Thirlwellt> i mean the 1kc inferno max capers with combined cape
[2022-12-08 15:25:29] <Keksbaer> @Neflii expect invention which is actually useful
[2022-12-08 15:25:33] <%bigdaddyandyv2> @OffKong you just gave me a heartattack

[2022-12-08 15:26:35] <andthekey> they're probably saying we're adding a new skill, you only get to vote on what it is/how its implemented there is insane demand for a new skill we just dont know what we want yet
[2022-12-08 15:26:36] <%$itsgunz4hire> gnome quest are garbo
[2022-12-08 15:26:41] <+Eliczir_> you really think they are adding a skill?
[2022-12-08 15:26:45] <@%OffKong> ANDY IS A PRICK
[2022-12-08 15:26:48] <%$itsgunz4hire> same as zeah its bad

[2022-12-08 15:27:25] <%$itsgunz4hire> @gnoma  sorry tiny friend
[2022-12-08 15:27:36] <imdaydreamin> i thought bird nests were enough for brews?
[2022-12-08 15:27:37] <Keksbaer> i just hope they dont bring a skill like archeology to osrs, a skill so complex it could be a own game
[2022-12-08 15:27:50] <@%OffKong> I just hope they bring something fun out
[2022-12-08 15:27:55] <andthekey> if they're polling the skill itself rather than just what skill/how it implemented i'll let you step on me
[2022-12-08 15:27:57] <%$itsgunz4hire> @gnome you cant help it moneys got involved
[2022-12-08 15:28:00] <Keksbaer> a lot of content, a lot of lore
[2022-12-08 15:28:00] <@%OffKong> I hope for leagues TB 2.0 and i'll come spend a few days with you :)

[2022-12-08 15:28:06] <+chindachin> as an rs3 and osrs player, arch is not complex. dungeoneering should be a minigame though.
[2022-12-08 15:28:08] <mr__hummus> dung?
[2022-12-08 15:28:09] <Keksbaer> and a lot of no clue what youre doing
[2022-12-08 15:28:44] <h1n1slayer> they need a skill that uses supplies, economy is in the bin thanks to TOA, volcano and supply saving mini games
[2022-12-08 15:28:55] <Keksbaer> theres more plot in archeology then in all of the osrs skills combined
[2022-12-08 15:28:58] <Thirlwellt> but it fits into the whole world
[2022-12-08 15:28:59] <3169> !clan
[2022-12-08 15:29:05] <imdaydreamin> youre doing birrrd nests+mole for max brew making?
[2022-12-08 15:29:05] <Thirlwellt> hate the idea of a skill like dung
[2022-12-08 15:29:45] <andthekey> they're testing the waters for invention with the masori/nex gear so a new skill would msot likely implement some kind of destroying items to make new items
[2022-12-08 15:29:51] <AlyxIsGaming> Slayer is kind of a minigame
[2022-12-08 15:29:56] <%$itsgunz4hire> maby sailing with having your own island that needs supplies to be invested
[2022-12-08 15:29:57] <%+levuh1> gauntlet is in the game so we already have dungeoneering
[2022-12-08 15:30:00] <AlyxIsGaming> which is why its so popular I think

[2022-12-08 15:30:14] <The_Lucky_Seal> Why are we talking about a new skill? did something get announced?
[2022-12-08 15:30:18] <ForrestGump10> new skill group slayer, crowd goes wild
[2022-12-08 15:30:19] <Thirlwellt> yeah something that fits into the open world
[2022-12-08 15:30:30] <imdaydreamin> a "gathering skill" is already a dead idea. interactive minigames will always replace traditional skilling
[2022-12-08 15:30:37] <%SCARF_GAP> wait I thought you killing mole cause you hate moles.
[2022-12-08 15:30:56] <@%OffKong> I'd love DG tbf
[2022-12-08 15:31:05] <shookster> sailing would actually be interesting. so much they can do with it
[2022-12-08 15:31:17] <Keksbaer> we have a fishing, mining and a wc/fm skill boss so far
[2022-12-08 15:31:17] <%+Marc0ric0> You should have brought a pet with you curtis

[2022-12-08 15:31:42] <+finger_demon> how would people feel about a druid skill that works like prayer for skilling giving temp boosts, reducing depletion rates etc.
[2022-12-08 15:31:44] <+lewisduzzer> How long you killing mole for?
[2022-12-08 15:31:54] <+wanwan156> would love to see a skill that makes you go to different areas to skill, would be great to see crowds of people together on release
[2022-12-08 15:31:55] <+Franwans> Can confirm Sneak is unreal
[2022-12-08 15:31:58] <%+Marc0ric0> 500 hours

[2022-12-08 15:32:26] <%$itsgunz4hire> pet bonus as new update? for example slayer pets and boss pets give like 2% dmg or +4 range bonus and skilling pets + 2 skill lvls
[2022-12-08 15:32:29] <+Franwans> Get a filthy pump off it too
[2022-12-08 15:32:46] <%THE_J1NN> best flavor!!
[2022-12-08 15:32:50] <Eb0_Gang> mole used to be scary stuff. now look at you just maging it like nothing
[2022-12-08 15:32:51] <imdaydreamin> is this fastest way to get brews? most of my friends did nest runs while doing other stuff
[2022-12-08 15:33:03] <+DeshCreator1> 6 fowsend??

[2022-12-08 19:09:33] <iamharmor> youd cast teleport to home twice with the trailblazer kit, and it would make you invisible
[2022-12-08 19:09:34] <mr_machamp> why dosn't the mole move?
[2022-12-08 19:09:53] <Swootz> Shadow setup better than masori and tbow for you?
