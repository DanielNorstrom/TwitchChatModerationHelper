[2022-12-10 20:16:15] <+Paladin_Setzer> they overplayed his weakness due to age when he didn't look that old.

[2022-12-10 21:35:19] <CaptainForcekin> I used bow/rapier in legacy. I use bow/GS now. Rapier is great for smaller engagements. It really just depends on your build
[2022-12-10 21:35:26] <dizzoe> gs scales even with dex and strength so its really verstile overall
[2022-12-10 21:35:43] <Dar_> I done a strenght, dex and con build so now that my greatsword is max level I can level up the rapier and musket with decent damage

[2022-12-10 21:43:26] <+jonnywatchbox> if they did that then they would have to do the same for mages
[2022-12-10 21:43:29] <%LordDooblay> Yeah, and the only reason why we are doing aoe instant cast is cause the current targetted healing is dogshit too lol
[2022-12-10 21:43:46] <%LordDooblay> controls your entire camera so you can't navigate, or you have to fight with targetting in crowds
[2022-12-10 21:43:57] <%Amebagrinder> The strongest heals are the targeted ones, but the targetting system sucks
[2022-12-10 21:44:06] <%Beardfu> Fire mage already have things they have to cast. hence why you dont see any LUL
[2022-12-10 21:44:48] <%+LCGMr9iceGuy> Targeted healing is much better if you just toggle group healing on and off or use hot keys
[2022-12-10 21:44:51] <+jonnywatchbox> i think they should add a 4th ability to every class.. that would be awesome
[2022-12-10 21:44:52] <CampbellKingdom> The lack of variation in healing builds really limits it I think. If they give us more damage options and they add something like a paladin build then they would have more options imo
