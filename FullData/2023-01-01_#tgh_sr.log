[2023-01-01 12:09:44] <%LumPhoenix> We can also use ethers on HM friend's turn, right?
[2023-01-01 12:10:11] <$UTDZac> you can use revives in a pinch
[2023-01-01 12:10:17] <Rasschla> I mean, after the gymbattle, you can look how to move around in the gym to force it in single battles
[2023-01-01 12:10:22] VIEWERS: 704
[2023-01-01 12:10:31] <$UTDZac> or a clever solution is just walk back to PC, deposit hm friend (it revives it) bring it back to gym. this avoids pc healing

[2023-01-01 12:10:48] <%that_bloody_wolf> you cant leave and reenter gym in this ruleset

[2023-01-01 12:41:34] <TommZee> Are those randomised, though? Because the Pokemon itself isn't randomised?

[2023-01-01 12:42:37] <$UTDZac> right, these are the original pokemon with randomized stats
[2023-01-01 12:42:52] <$UTDZac> i think steven's team is always metang, skarmory, aggron
[2023-01-01 12:42:54] <%2pert> Yep, checked bulbapedia, original mons
[2023-01-01 12:42:54] <%Kailaria> and probably abilities, right..?
[2023-01-01 12:43:08] <victaghost> yeah only the stats+abilities are randomized

[2023-01-01 12:43:34] <%Duckels> im curious if the movesets are random
[2023-01-01 12:43:35] <Murdim> it's intel on 2 fully evolved mons, not exactly challenge-breaking and impossible to abuse further
[2023-01-01 12:43:40] <%+Metusfatum> Technically not supposed to examine them.
[2023-01-01 12:43:40] <%LumPhoenix> Check em, Kaizo will kick you in the balls, you have to do the same to them.

[2023-01-01 12:45:55] <TommZee> Looking at Mrtang, Metang's move seem vanilla, so it's not the most information, idk if the spread is altered
[2023-01-01 12:45:57] <%+Wistomaniac> just check it
[2023-01-01 12:46:00] <%+theSkyfisher> the tracker shows the vanilla move pool though for the metang

[2023-01-01 12:46:51] <%+theSkyfisher> so i think the moveset is vanilla so you wouldn't get infor from that i don't think

[2023-01-01 12:48:06] <Earendil409> We just saw stats from the metang leveling up, so that info was given outside of the tracker
[2023-01-01 12:48:11] <%Myrral> Metang showed Serene Grace -- something is not vanilla
[2023-01-01 12:48:13] <doingmybesthere> The ability was not
[2023-01-01 12:48:16] <$UTDZac> Asking around, seems like the mons + movesets are vanilla. The ability and stat spread are randomized.
[2023-01-01 12:48:18] <SamuelBest> metang doesn't have that much spa in vanilla does it

[2023-01-01 12:48:30] <joeyno1234> it would be cool if you could search for a mon in the tracker and erase info for it
[2023-01-01 12:48:39] <TommZee> I'm  it sure abiut the stats, the moves are definitely vanilla, and the Ability seems like it isn't

[2023-01-01 12:48:55] <$UTDZac> @joeyno1234 not a bad idea
[2023-01-01 12:48:56] <%+qCecil> I know 100% vanilla metang has psychic and metal claw for that fight
[2023-01-01 12:49:04] <212mochaman> metang usually has def as its #1 stat so no way was that vanilla stats
[2023-01-01 12:49:07] <+RegularPerson> it's such a niche situation that I doubt at this point in the game it will give any sort of actual advantage
[2023-01-01 12:49:08] <%+theSkyfisher> the moveset is fully vanilla
[2023-01-01 12:49:18] <$UTDZac> its a 1-to-1 match. all mon species uses the same spread as the others in their species
[2023-01-01 12:49:22] <TommZee> We coukd check at the end of the run in the notes?
[2023-01-01 12:49:23] <%Kailaria> yea, Castform's ability doesn't get included in the pool since it can only affect Castform
[2023-01-01 12:49:26] <TommZee> could*
[2023-01-01 12:49:52] <%Kailaria> and I don't think the rando makes an exception for Castform to include a chance to have its vanilla ability
[2023-01-01 12:50:17] <%plasmasnake745> I can't see anything in the ruleset about not getting information when it's possible to

[2023-01-01 12:51:54] <%+Metusfatum> @plasmasnake745 you are correct, it didn't come about until some "clever" players got cheeky and started catching every wild pokemon and calling them HM friends to examine stats.

[2023-01-01 12:53:37] <%+Metusfatum> I totally agree with you @TGH_sr this isn't the same as farming hm friends for information.
[2023-01-01 12:53:49] <Dumdio> checking stevens stats seems fine to me, i wouldnt change the hm friend evey route though
[2023-01-01 12:53:51] <%Prometheus70516> @2pert Not more morbid than a real hawk grabbing a real mouse as a meal. tghSip
[2023-01-01 12:54:04] <Kappatechy> The same three mons, one of which you won't even be battling against past that point
[2023-01-01 12:54:10] <%Xandor123> If the spirit of the challenge is to avoid getting stats on mons, I feel like you should avoid finding out info on his mons if you can avoid it
[2023-01-01 12:54:11] <%Raxby> Metang isn't fully-evolved so knowing its stats when you won't see < 30 lvl Pok√©mon anymore doesn't matter that much anyway
[2023-01-01 12:54:17] <%SteVanLe> Happy New Year TGH! Nice really deep run you have :D
[2023-01-01 12:54:26] <Earendil409> Pokemon are shown to be far more intelligent to being sapient as opposed to mice... so it IS a bit different @Prometheus70516
[2023-01-01 12:54:33] VIEWERS: 853
[2023-01-01 12:54:46] <212mochaman> only solution to that is completely changing stevens team so that it doesnt have skarmory, aggron and whatever metang could evolve to
[2023-01-01 12:54:55] <%Raxby> But yeah ultimately it really doesn't matter that much. You could've gotten that info if you had tried an extra pivot at the start of the game vs just running your starter
[2023-01-01 12:55:00] <%Xandor123> Maybe it's one of those things that we ignore, like accidentally taking that refight
[2023-01-01 12:55:04] <StrategyMamber> in legal terms it might very well fall under unavoidable eccident. soo, probably not against the rules..

[2023-01-01 12:55:17] <Earendil409> you also just saw Metang... a pokemon you will not be fighting
[2023-01-01 12:55:18] <%Prometheus70516> @Earendil409 It's a wild animal catching a wild animal for lunch, I don't see that much difference. Since pokemon eat other pokemon on a regular basis or am I wrong?

[2023-01-01 14:23:37] <Earendil409> There's a derpy thing with levels where the damage formula includes 2xlevel/5, so going from 89 to 90 is a larger buff than 88 to 89 due to truncating in the math
[2023-01-01 14:23:40] <%LumPhoenix> It just works
[2023-01-01 14:23:41] <@%fsvgm777> Bae-nette.
[2023-01-01 14:23:58] <@%ori_sky> I'm assuming it's fluctuating, so yeah, part of the formula for the fluctuating experience curve is
[2023-01-01 14:24:00] <@%ori_sky> (n / 2) + 32
[2023-01-01 14:24:10] <%berniebeatsboxes> N is the level of the pokemon?
[2023-01-01 14:24:16] <@%ori_sky> it's not the entire formula but it means at least part of the required exp is based on level / 2
[2023-01-01 14:24:27] <@%ori_sky> and it's integer division so it gets floored, rather than carrying the decimal
[2023-01-01 14:24:45] <%berniebeatsboxes> So it's a linear curve, but floored

[2023-01-01 14:26:06] <@%ori_sky> it's like a regular curve but part of it comprises a division by 2 so it means the exp required to reach odd levels is less than it would be without the floor

[2023-01-01 14:57:37] <%+flimmsovan> that level diff makes less difference imo; could have a mon which gives more xp

[2023-01-01 14:57:42] <Nvyouss> No trainers to skip?
[2023-01-01 14:57:42] <aurorajet> it doesn't really matter for a dif of 6 levels
[2023-01-01 14:58:02] <%$Varldin> let a pokemon get a free turn on you in VR maybe?
