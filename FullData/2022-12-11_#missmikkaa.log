[2022-12-11 01:05:32] <@%^y0shi_b0t> RinkRB is trying to gather a team of Master Thieves for the Thieves Guild heist on the Bank of Cyrodiil! To aid in this quest join by typing "!heist <betting amount>" in chat. The more thieves who join the bigger the chance of success! (Max amount: 9999)
[2022-12-11 01:07:32] <@%^y0shi_b0t> Ready your bows and sheath your daggers, the time has come for the heist to begin!
[2022-12-11 01:07:34] <@%^y0shi_b0t> RinkRB managed to sneak his/her way past the guards completely undetected! With impressive lockpicking and sneaking skills you truly deserve the title of Master Thief.
[2022-12-11 01:07:36] <@%^y0shi_b0t> Results from the Heist: RinkRB (114)
[2022-12-11 01:47:32] <@%^y0shi_b0t> The beggar spies just informed us that the Imperial guards seem to have lowered their security. Now would be a perfect time for the Thieves Guild to strike! Type "!heist <betting amount>.
