[2022-12-23 13:37:06] <61Namzo> wait why for mobile gwent?
[2022-12-23 13:37:07] <Chacaceiro> hmm

[2022-12-23 13:37:18] <Chacaceiro> explode 8 power units?
[2022-12-23 13:37:23] <61Namzo> ah
[2022-12-23 13:37:23] <Fraven2137> mobile players bring much more money 61Namzo

[2022-12-23 13:37:26] <trashofthesociety> TrollDespair
[2022-12-23 13:37:28] <Chacaceiro> yeah, yiou can explode 9 power units

[2022-12-23 13:37:54] <%insilico_man> not shiruu 9 bruh
[2022-12-23 13:37:55] <%+Benelioto> hot take but slama is to blame for putting so much resource into failed projects like draft and rogue mage instead of improving the main gameplay
[2022-12-23 13:37:59] <+Heurry> prob 10s
[2022-12-23 13:38:09] <Chacaceiro> how do you schirry tens?
[2022-12-23 13:38:14] <yarpenzinger> each card should be specific to a row imo
[2022-12-23 13:38:21] <BrausStocker> i mean there is no other card game that has such a beautiful and mature design like gwAnt
[2022-12-23 13:38:23] <Chacaceiro> no way anymore
[2022-12-23 13:38:24] <+Heurry> should've done it last turn on 9s I guess
[2022-12-23 13:38:31] <%insilico_man> we could shiruu 9's last turn Stare
[2022-12-23 13:38:39] <Chacaceiro> i guess so
[2022-12-23 13:38:48] <dstr8killenem> card games designed for kids and moms
[2022-12-23 13:38:53] <61Namzo> schirru the 12
[2022-12-23 13:39:05] <Chacaceiro> schirru the 12 I guess
[2022-12-23 13:39:15] <yarpenzinger> the cards are so boring like most are just dead points

[2022-12-23 13:39:51] <ebertr0n> @benelioto slama saved gwent, they overreached in beta, hiring castles for opens and shit
[2022-12-23 13:39:53] <BrausStocker> yeah i mean 85% of cards arent playable at all
[2022-12-23 13:39:55] <areflex34> they could ve created wager formats like mtg to make it more competitive and proactive
[2022-12-23 13:40:21] <%+Benelioto> @ebertr0n don't disagree, but that can be true at the same time as him making mistakes later on that stagnated the game
[2022-12-23 13:40:32] <BrausStocker> dont worry spyro
[2022-12-23 13:40:36] <61Namzo> gwent will definitely decline in player count once there will be no content, only veteran players which basically means a dead game
[2022-12-23 13:40:39] <+Jekkfje> even though it's a year out do you have any plans for after gwent?
[2022-12-23 13:40:42] <Chacaceiro> I think the main problem with all of this going on is that I feel orphan of card games
[2022-12-23 13:40:44] <BrausStocker> ill buy cdpr next year and it wont die
[2022-12-23 13:40:55] <dark___hand> They also didnt make a lot of money from cards because you could craft any card that was released for free
[2022-12-23 13:40:57] <dstr8killenem> after gwent spyro should develop and stream a Hello Kitty battle card game.
[2022-12-23 13:41:01] <CaptainFahim7> @BrausStocker be Elon Musk
[2022-12-23 13:41:02] <yarpenzinger> it saddens me to see wasted potential
[2022-12-23 13:41:05] <Chacaceiro> I mean, if gwent were shut down today, what would you play?
[2022-12-23 13:41:14] <%+Benelioto> to be a CCG gamer is to be a nomad, best not to get attached
[2022-12-23 13:41:25] <yarpenzinger> the art of this game insane wish the game play could have been similar
[2022-12-23 13:41:28] <61Namzo> will the 72 cards include 3 card drops?
[2022-12-23 13:41:28] <agent_182> gwent has so much potential with it's art alone
[2022-12-23 13:41:29] <BrausStocker> actually maybe we should tweet with gwant community to elon
[2022-12-23 13:41:35] <netrunner54> its fine guys they will make gwont 2 Copium

[2022-12-23 13:42:12] <ebertr0n> @benelioto gwent stagnation started when he left for cp, this years direction started the decline imo... i'm not idolising slama or anything but i think its unfair to blame him for the decline
[2022-12-23 13:42:13] <BrausStocker> #Elon save gwAnt
[2022-12-23 13:42:15] <Chambos101> Honestly gwent 2 might not be a bad idea, cause they can restructure some shit, but it aint happening KEKW

[2022-12-23 13:42:54] <%+Benelioto> @ebertr0n draft and rogue mage were his babies that took up resource and they were failures, not really much more to say
[2022-12-23 13:43:04] <Lucyna_Kushinada> looks promising  Thinkge
[2022-12-23 13:43:08] <%Methaies> does snap have a proper pc UI now? Or is it still a mobile game?
[2022-12-23 13:43:09] <%+bhakti91> 50 bucks for what?
[2022-12-23 13:43:14] <+Jekkfje> snap I think has the biggest viewer base for card games aside from hearthstone
[2022-12-23 13:43:17] <Chacaceiro> ouch
[2022-12-23 13:43:18] <areflex34> dont play snap if you re switching to a tcg at least choose carefully not something for cash grabbers

[2022-12-23 15:34:16] <%evershadow> Like seriously, poisons will destroy an 18p unit just as easily as the 6p one. No reason to use them from the start.
