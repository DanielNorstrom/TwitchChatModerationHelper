[2022-12-19 20:27:41] <%reivehnfliyt> someone just had to mention caffeine as I was trying to sleep, now i feel obligated to say that caffeine is very difficult to overdose on, not least of which. because our bodies are very good at handling it in reasonable quantities, in copious amounts you will most likely be throwing up and convulsing before consuming or absorbing a lethal dose. it's actually impresive
[2022-12-19 20:28:31] <anniebele> hii Durgon!

As I grab my powdered wig and Kentucky rifle. Blow a golf ball sized hole through the first man, he's dead on the spot. Draw my pistol on the second man, miss him entirely because it's smoothbore and nails the neighbors dog. I have to resort to the cannon mounted at the top of the stairs loaded with grape shot, "Tally ho lads" the grape shot shreds two men in

[2022-12-19 21:58:52] <!%admiral_frostbite> @ThePyenusman I went to the ER afterward and they did. Sent me home and told me to change it every 12 hours. It just happens to be deep and in a bad spot on my hand that reopens when I try and do pretty much anything.

[2022-12-19 21:59:17] <!%admiral_frostbite> @admiral_frostbite They didn't want to stitch it since it was a deep puncture and that can trap the bacteria in.

[2022-12-19 22:00:04] <!%admiral_frostbite> Moral of the story is an 85# dog can bite really hard and people need to keep their darn dogs on leashes since a charging dog is what triggered the fight.

[2022-12-19 22:03:02] <!%admiral_frostbite> @wojna1 Even non-aggressive dogs should be on a leash since the other dog may not be ready to be charged. It's as much a protection for their dog as it is for mine.
