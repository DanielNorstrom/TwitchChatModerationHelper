[2022-12-14 03:11:25] <+Tetsujikan> @PeachMilky you should check it cause psp batteries that have been sitting for a long time can swell and explode
[2022-12-14 03:11:28] <PirateKing27> i have one of my ps2 memory cards as well lol
[2022-12-14 03:11:33] <%Cathise1> my psp works, but the battery swole

[2022-12-14 03:15:49] <%+reixith> it took me forever to be able to buy the ps5. had to sign up for the release notification. and be right on top of it.
[2022-12-14 03:15:50] <soleater01> doing well! thought of dropping by after how long its been. i remember the vtubing days of you
[2022-12-14 03:15:51] <+Tetsujikan> i got 2 ps5's on release, but i traded one off for a series x, only got 2 because of some confusion with preordering

[2022-12-14 03:17:37] <+ChocolateChum> Unless you really want to play the exclusives on PS5 you might as well go with the PC upgrades
[2022-12-14 03:17:45] <$Cpt_phantom> If there’s actually ps6’s available
[2022-12-14 03:18:09] <%+reixith> i had to get a ps5 because things were starting to drop support from the ps3.

[2022-12-14 03:26:21] <+Tetsujikan> a cutscene can happen even without 3, its like the cutscene can "cause" better odds to getting a limit break
[2022-12-14 03:26:32] <+Tetsujikan> but ive gotten a cutscene without matching 3, lol
[2022-12-14 03:26:37] <+saggysir01> I think sometimes a cutscene activates when you get one, but I don't quite remember
[2022-12-14 03:26:48] <+Tetsujikan> its just random

[2022-12-14 06:05:58] <verajonson> A cantina is a type of bar common in Latin America and Spain. The word is similar in etymology to "canteen", and is derived from the Italian word for a cellar, winery, or vault. In Italy, the word cantina refers to a room below the ground level where wine and other products such as salami are stored.
[2022-12-14 06:05:58] <evgenijgr> As a person who knows little to nothing about FF7 (although I have original which I will try) I must say: Zack looks a bit like Cloud Strife...

[2022-12-14 09:20:39] <+siege7575> ranch is a very creamy sauce made primarily of buttermilk and sour cream with a sort oa herbal after-taste, think its fair to say that parsley is the herbal note that sticks out the most

[2022-12-14 13:06:27] <CosplayDiver> I now kinda wanna see a game that’s just one entire boss fight
[2022-12-14 13:06:38] <CosplayDiver> All 30 hours
[2022-12-14 13:07:17] <NoJodasTio> Yeah. Main problem with long streams are boss fights. Each try hit harder than normal length stream
[2022-12-14 13:08:04] <NoJodasTio> @CosplayDiver That could be some epic shit.

[2022-12-14 13:36:23] <Aflay_> I have a history with The Price of Freedom. I played it during my study grind. I was failing math, and it was the final exam. I had to cram 6 months of work into one night, and I was sure it was hopeless, so I played Price of Freedom on repeat. I passed...with a 65. somehow.

[2022-12-14 13:36:36] <NoJodasTio> Just imagine a living Zack in the remake. I still have hopes

[2022-12-14 13:37:01] <Aflay_> Who knows? I just hope we see more of him in FF7.

[2022-12-14 13:38:36] <+Jibigami> different timeline
[2022-12-14 13:38:40] <SweetNightmaer> I'm guessing they wanted to tie into the Remaster
[2022-12-14 13:38:41] <@SirKrim> INB4 extra cutscene for beating Minerva (Secret hard boss)
[2022-12-14 13:38:43] <Straata0123> 7r seems different, so i guess 7 is OG
[2022-12-14 13:38:50] <%YuzuPyon> Good job !!

[2022-12-14 13:39:20] <%Cathise1> SMH imagine reading
[2022-12-14 13:39:23] <@SirKrim> Very hard to miss all the spoilers for this
[2022-12-14 13:39:29] <+Jibigami> so "to be continued in FF7"
[2022-12-14 13:39:52] <%YuzuPyon> why would you watch this if you didn't want to be spoiled peachmilkyStressshake
[2022-12-14 13:39:53] <Jek_MX> 7 Remake isn't the same as CC reunion, so yeah the sequel is 7 OG and FF7 Re is the next
[2022-12-14 13:39:59] <BlackWolfx117x> it does make sense msclHmm
[2022-12-14 13:40:03] <@SirKrim> Yep, makes sense

[2022-12-14 13:40:25] <Jek_MX> 7 remake is a sequel to ff 7 in general
[2022-12-14 13:40:26] VIEWERS: 255
[2022-12-14 13:40:33] <Aflay_> I'm kind of glad he didn't survive. I dunno if this is a hot take, but the ending is a masterpiece, even though it's sad.
[2022-12-14 13:40:44] <%+panthurrr> peachmilkyHuh
[2022-12-14 13:40:45] <+GoldenAdhesive> so in otherwise they might have a different plot for the ff7r?
[2022-12-14 13:40:49] <BlackWolfx117x> foxteaNote
[2022-12-14 13:40:49] <Jek_MX> yes
[2022-12-14 13:40:56] <Aflay_> Things are gonna get...fuckey...
[2022-12-14 13:41:00] <%Cathise1> 7 remake = not remake YEP
[2022-12-14 13:41:04] <%Cathise1> reunion = remake YEP
[2022-12-14 13:41:07] <XellosSlayer> i also think that they wanted to make Crisis core more accessible so that more ppl would have idea who the Zack is as he will be in next FF7R
[2022-12-14 13:41:10] <NoJodasTio> FeelsBadMan  RainTime
[2022-12-14 13:41:26] <+thewhitetennoranger> Reunion is just for people to reunite with zack.

[2022-12-14 13:43:58] <Aflay_> Yeah. Cloud looked up to Zack and adopted his cheerful optimism.
[2022-12-14 13:44:07] <Aflay_> Up until Zack died.
