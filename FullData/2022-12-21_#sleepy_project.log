[2022-12-21 15:45:35] <%+HEATHAWK666> @JayBusch If they hate my sentry gun so bad, they can run in front of it and try and dismantle it themselves
[2022-12-21 15:45:51] <+phantomsalmon> then the moment he found GPU, he found second one in the second run immediately after, he went made

[2022-12-21 15:47:17] <Order_of_Dusk> Hey Sleepy, wanna commit a warcrime by placing down a funnee tripod? Because the Sentry Gun is probably a warcrime under Rule 80 Chapter 28 of customary international humanitarian law

[2022-12-21 20:09:02] <@%viciusv1> Yes.  Especially with all the different operators
[2022-12-21 20:09:07] <%Fauxtato> Siege seems like it requires the skill matchup knowledge of a moba and the twitch reflexes of an FPS game
[2022-12-21 20:09:08] <%JayBusch> Ehh, I mean it’s sweaty but you can pick it up reasonably quick
[2022-12-21 20:09:12] <+Wasdniak> Siege turned into a hero shooter

[2022-12-21 21:18:54] <+UBCS_BananaMan> with safes in DMZ you usually get AI dropped in on you and with Warzone, the only real threat is players
