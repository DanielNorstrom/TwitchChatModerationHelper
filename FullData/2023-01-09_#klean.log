[2023-01-09 14:20:00] <%+dess1m> if they make it so you can actually find good ammo in raid then sure. instead of always finding boxes of prs and other shit ammo
[2023-01-09 14:20:05] <%5cavlive5matt3r> I wish they would make inventories dynamic
[2023-01-09 14:20:12] <MR_GOOD_GUY> hey klean, do you know which map has the most scavs? i need scav kills for my weekly and i dont see much in woods. and custom is scary for pvp Sadge
[2023-01-09 14:20:15] <@%+fortburke> @dess1m Agreed
[2023-01-09 14:20:21] <$TheDirtyRatt> High end ammos are still on traders.. the current setup was implemented last wipe.. the only one is the PBP 9mm it‚Äôs FIR or crafts nobly I do believe
[2023-01-09 14:20:22] <%TheScentofaMan> yea I don't agree with bt but these rounds are damage on range maybe that's why?
[2023-01-09 14:20:37] <+way_back> Hope your having a good day
[2023-01-09 14:20:47] <$TheDirtyRatt> They just quest lock a lot of the good ammos
[2023-01-09 14:20:59] <%5cavlive5matt3r> @Klean What if they allowed you to get the good items from traders but they made the inventories different with each reset and make the high tier items highly infrequent?

[2023-01-09 14:22:54] <+jail_milk> I used to think flea was the problem. When they did the event where flea and traders were disabled, it was a big revelation to me that I think trader availability was a bigger problem. Flea pricing took care of the S&D and made things scarce, still. Whereas you could just load up ammo and weapons from traders. I always had endless kits basically and having them off was huuuuge.

[2023-01-09 14:23:35] <%DeathByVodkaBottle> @That1DoggoTV nah got to make the quake with quakemaker
[2023-01-09 14:23:40] <bluebyou> what changed?
[2023-01-09 14:23:42] <@%+fortburke> I never cared for my hideout, now I do
[2023-01-09 14:23:51] <datboynutss> i think it should be harder to level traders, like if you wanted to level peacekeeper instead of skier or sum
[2023-01-09 14:23:52] <Incrediblee7> wipe for me is pointless because in week of grind, i can already have everything... @Klean and then just quit playing LUL
[2023-01-09 14:23:53] <%TheScentofaMan> @5cavlive5matt3r I know but economy framework is so difficult to implement so many factors affect pricing
[2023-01-09 14:23:54] <+way_back> Tarkov one of the games i hate playing but love watching
[2023-01-09 14:23:55] <+jail_milk> @fortburke Hideout and FIR should be the main source of high end gear.
[2023-01-09 14:23:57] <Daanootje> sartrik cohhLurk /
[2023-01-09 14:24:08] <That1DoggoTV> @DeathByVodkaBottle well i gotta k.o. some pmcs with eko
[2023-01-09 14:24:15] <+CafePatron> wonder what it would be like if lvl 4 and 5 armor/helmets were FiR only and no flee lol
[2023-01-09 14:24:19] <@%thecensoredlord> fook the chads
[2023-01-09 14:24:21] <+RebelFoxtrot> LUL just.. just stfu.
[2023-01-09 14:24:21] <Daanootje> Good cohhT
[2023-01-09 14:24:23] <+Adrunath> @Klean  what did i miss?
[2023-01-09 14:24:27] <%TheScentofaMan> What if Rogues now again get m62s hmmmmm kleanSip
[2023-01-09 14:24:32] <+jail_milk> You play 10 hours a day you're going to have good gear no matter what, most people don't play 10 hours a day.
[2023-01-09 14:24:32] <bluebyou> What did they change doe? did the ammo prices change or did they take them off the traders?
[2023-01-09 14:24:32] <datboynutss> 9x21 is now as rare as 7n40 which is interesting
[2023-01-09 14:24:33] <%DeathByVodkaBottle> @That1DoggoTV a true chad you are sir
[2023-01-09 14:24:42] <atomizer53> and then they complain that everyone is rocking lvl 6 armor second week lmfao theres no pleasing everyone
[2023-01-09 14:24:45] <iyo___> hey @Klean and chat, if i'm only going to play one Stalker, vanilla anomaly or gamma?
[2023-01-09 14:24:56] <+RebelFoxtrot> Facts. Would be such a good feeling finding those things in raid if they were that rare.
[2023-01-09 14:24:56] <+Crio1s> What exactly did they do? I just woke up Lmao
[2023-01-09 14:25:04] <Just_the__doctor> HEY GUYSSS
[2023-01-09 14:25:07] <Incrediblee7> would you also remove barters for level 5 gear?
[2023-01-09 14:25:07] <bluebyou> Yeah what did they dop
[2023-01-09 14:25:09] <Just_the__doctor> caps
[2023-01-09 14:25:11] <atomizer53> for sure. more emphasis on hideout would be nice
[2023-01-09 14:25:13] <+lacr3> It would if traders sell ammo when the traders are in world only. So you‚Äôd have to make it to them. Buy some ammo and bring it back to the stash.
[2023-01-09 14:25:14] <That1DoggoTV> @DeathByVodkaBottle i got to tarkov shooter part 4 before i completed unprotected by dangerous lmao
[2023-01-09 14:25:15] VIEWERS: 443
[2023-01-09 14:25:22] <Daanootje> @iyo___ I would pick Gamma personally
[2023-01-09 14:25:23] <+kylewirgaming> @iyo___ Play the orignal vanilla one's that way you know the lore
[2023-01-09 14:25:27] <@%+fortburke> Craft and/or release more ammo to be lootable, we have had the same ammo lootable in raid for like 5 years
[2023-01-09 14:25:32] <%TheScentofaMan> bt m80s m62s gone lvl 4 traders @crio1s
[2023-01-09 14:25:43] <@%thecensoredlord> lmao

[2023-01-09 14:26:04] <bluebyou> Yeah dude do taht instead of actually saying what they did to the ammo lmao xD
[2023-01-09 14:26:09] <+pichoto> I can't buy M80? xD i just got lvl 3 yesterday, I guess I will continue the grind xD

[2023-01-09 14:26:24] <TrashlKitten> i understand the change, but maybe get rid of lvl 6 armor barters and add more ammo crafts with the update

[2023-01-09 14:27:39] <+kylewirgaming> @iyo___ Play the 3 ones vanilla if you want and do a little Gamma here and there
[2023-01-09 14:27:49] <+WebDevJourney> this is huge
[2023-01-09 14:27:52] <%TheScentofaMan> this title is juicer level
[2023-01-09 14:28:04] <Daanootje> @iyo___ Oh, it is your first stalker game in general! Yeah just play the vanilla games then.
[2023-01-09 14:28:11] <%+dess1m> it takes 10 hours to craft ammo like sp-6, even fucken 5.45 pp takes 5 hours. 12 hours for 200 m856a1. if they go this route with removing ammos from traders, they NEED to make things like ammo crates not a waste of time to open
[2023-01-09 14:28:25] <@%+fortburke> Hutch literally got grenadier yesterday too LUL
[2023-01-09 14:28:30] <MR_GOOD_GUY> how am i gonna do the quest without impact nade :O

[2023-01-09 14:30:47] <%5cavlive5matt3r> Honestly I'm not against the idea of access to low-mid tier ammo. I just wish that recoil was revamped
[2023-01-09 14:30:49] <lindog369> the people who are against the new ammo change will also probs say the game was better before FIR  and mad that they cant day trade

[2023-01-09 14:40:56] <InnererKonflikt> i made the veritas soundtest. i always had issues with behind and front, its always the same to me. and sometimes with binaural on OR off, i had issues to distinguish between level below outside or inside above. but once im ingame its much easier to distinguish, i need visual percepotion to really help and move my head ingame dfor directionality to truly help out, but, mostly, it¬¥s still completely bugged, above below, behind and front, broken. but the same level directionality is fine
[2023-01-09 14:41:06] <nadechef> nice shots
[2023-01-09 14:41:06] <georgi911> good ol' reserve spawns :/
[2023-01-09 14:41:07] <%5cavlive5matt3r> @mrcunnystunner Essentially all AP ammo are gone from traders. Except 7.62x54. M80 you can get, but only from LV4 PK

[2023-01-09 14:42:27] <%+dess1m> it would be cool if tarkov had a big map like the cycle with constant drop ins and dynamic l;oot, que times and spawns are a fundmately bad part of this game
[2023-01-09 14:42:50] <+Radenlol> @dess1m the 1 fps map
[2023-01-09 14:42:52] <+Zyroah> @5cavlive5matt3r pretty‚Äôs sure M80 is level 2 or 3 pk, I can buy it and don‚Äôt have him lv 4

[2023-01-09 14:43:40] <%5cavlive5matt3r> Honestly I wish that they would buff/restore the good features of many weapons/meds. They just need to restrict access to traders/flea, such as making it in-game.
[2023-01-09 14:43:48] <%5cavlive5matt3r> @Zyroah It might have changed in the interrim.

[2023-01-09 14:44:26] <%5cavlive5matt3r> @Saro4president meds can't be insured.
[2023-01-09 14:44:28] <Cacafutimartin> i buy the CATs to burn dollars basically
[2023-01-09 14:44:51] <%+trued2> iirc CAT is faster than the esmarch.
[2023-01-09 14:45:03] <%+Wolvf_TV> you saw him
[2023-01-09 14:45:03] <InnererKonflikt> the sounds in tarkov are crisp. audio costs cputime. if they truly implemented binaural audio worth a damn like hunt showdown with this level of crisp audio, it would cost alot. i wonder how they gonna fix the binaural performance cost. hunt showdown has great binaural audio and accurate but its sound quality itself, of the effects, sounds like 80¬¥s 16bit 44khz garbage

[2023-01-09 14:50:19] <%Rudged> @Wolvf_TV Audio is not easy that's why they fail. They'll learn and improve.
[2023-01-09 14:50:20] <+Harrymason18> @Wolvf_TV they thought steam audio was the fix but had to ditch it which is why it is so bad rn
[2023-01-09 14:50:22] <+zainegardner> "Realistic shooter"...Magical headphones to hear someone in another building through walls
[2023-01-09 14:50:33] <xToXni> @wolvf_tv  they removed steam different audio now they gotta re-designe it

[2023-01-09 14:50:39] <+RebelFoxtrot> @Wolvf_TV Red Dead 2 took over 8 years to make. Elder Scrolls 6, gonna be over 10, Good games take time. Just because we get early access to this one doesnt mean its done.
[2023-01-09 14:50:59] <kennysexman> @zainegardner when was a video game ever meant to be realistic

[2023-01-09 14:57:42] <+mr__matla> @Klean for a total noob what is the best healing setup to bring into a raid there are so many healing items lol !
[2023-01-09 14:58:03] <lexus8014> @Veritas you tested the DTS unbound thing too?
[2023-01-09 14:58:13] <%+desertrambler> @mr__matla I‚Äôd look up a guide on YT
[2023-01-09 14:58:21] <InnererKonflikt> @mr__matla ? something for bleeds, something for broken limbs, something to stop bleeding temporarily, and something big to generallm bring health points up?

[2023-01-09 14:58:31] <%TheScentofaMan> @veritas agreed game is uncomfortably loud using Dts dimms it a lot which is too low LUL

[2023-01-09 15:05:37] <InnererKonflikt> in hunt showdown, rarely anyone plays meta weapons, because they cost SO MUCH. and when they appear, they arent even OP just give hunters who know how to handle them an advantage. chaning ammo in tarkov does the same thing. increase rarity, accessibility, and such to the point, where only people who actually deserve em, use em.

[2023-01-09 15:10:50] <@%+fortburke> @Happycoin A lot of ammo has been raised trader levels

[2023-01-09 15:11:06] <Reodhadh> @Florishier vertical audio is only functional on streets, customs and factory atm, waiting for the next audio update
[2023-01-09 15:11:13] <shakenbake38s> @anoscura they moved all the good ammo to level 4 traders and removed 762 bs
[2023-01-09 15:11:15] <!%Veritas> comtac 2's are -5db to ambient volume and +10 db to footsteps, reloading sounds, etc. its busted with the oculus audio output now

[2023-01-09 15:11:21] <+mcsouthstar> with the way the game currently is, you either take a low percentage play by rushing or there is a lot of standoff play where people sound whore

[2023-01-09 15:17:38] <Wulfgar_RED> The main problem I have with new audio is CPU budget. People don't have CPUs to run game properly and new system require even more resources.

[2023-01-09 15:26:22] <mf_Cardano> can't they just buy their 7.62 off the flea still?
[2023-01-09 15:26:23] <Dahl0012> @CafePatron so true lol, did you know that the option after raid music somehow affects your fps lol
[2023-01-09 15:26:24] <+Chimerical_Eclipse> i honestly think m80 should be in raid only
[2023-01-09 15:26:26] <+jinxplayer> sorry chat, what happened to the ammo?
[2023-01-09 15:26:26] <%+whomst_d_ve_ly_yaint_nt> most people never hits max traders
[2023-01-09 15:26:31] <ZanmanXx> the ammo changes make the first couple months of wipe so much more enjoyable, not gonna be dying to SR-25 with a Razor every other raid now
[2023-01-09 15:26:31] <mf_Cardano> 7.62 bp*
[2023-01-09 15:26:32] <+FraggyP> Nah fr it made the game so much better Same with locking the sr-25 to lvl 3 or whatever. Makes the game better 1000% no idea how you disagree with it
[2023-01-09 15:26:32] <cruzo> Imagine if anti cheats could brick computers when cheats were caught , obviously false flags would suck but man would it be great to see

[2023-01-09 15:27:02] <Gligoth> YES
[2023-01-09 15:27:03] <%Lourio> 100%
[2023-01-09 15:27:06] <DARTIC2K> it is
[2023-01-09 15:27:07] <renodemron> YE
[2023-01-09 15:27:07] <%+parasanic> i agree
[2023-01-09 15:27:07] <givemespitfire> 100%
[2023-01-09 15:27:08] <+mcsouthstar> absolutely, why do you think people like the wipes
[2023-01-09 15:27:08] <PopfisDjV2> that's when the game is the most fun
[2023-01-09 15:27:09] <Maestro_Adam> early/mid is the best
[2023-01-09 15:27:10] <cruzo> Yea
[2023-01-09 15:27:11] <%scruffyjash> yupp
[2023-01-09 15:27:11] <+Semipro_ttv> That video showing the aim fov works great
[2023-01-09 15:27:11] <QuestionableGamerz> gonna see a lot more players running 5.45 ammo now
[2023-01-09 15:27:13] <ZanmanXx> early and mid wipe is the best part, late wipe is lame
[2023-01-09 15:27:13] <%+kevsabot> preach brother
[2023-01-09 15:27:15] <VorlundCrow> Fuckin oath. Early wipe is the best part of the game by a HUGE margin.
[2023-01-09 15:27:16] <InnererKonflikt> @PickleFPS chads go for adrenaline, timmies go for dopamine monkaF
[2023-01-09 15:27:23] <%+jahale6> @klean do you mind recapping what the change was? I‚Äôm sorry if you‚Äôve already talked about it multiple times.
[2023-01-09 15:27:24] <BoppyDoodleSkip> I think maybe even more worth to add on more of those better ammos to be fir only
[2023-01-09 15:27:24] <A_Saboteur> early / mid is the most fun part of EFT
[2023-01-09 15:27:25] <%Jeppe_Helt> Yeah!
[2023-01-09 15:27:28] <+dailyshades> @jpasty BP was also removed from traders
[2023-01-09 15:27:29] <Gnashey> Ok but what about the razer n vudu being gone from jager ü•≤
[2023-01-09 15:27:30] <%Lourio> i only play early/mid wipe
[2023-01-09 15:27:31] <+FraggyP> Now they just need to make BP locked behind a trader or a quest you don‚Äôt get till lvl 55, fuck BP
[2023-01-09 15:27:33] <Florishier> @Klean are there barters for the rounds that got moved up?

[2023-01-09 15:27:40] <+RebelFoxtrot> I also want to feel amazing when I find the high tier gear in raid, instead of it just being readily available.
[2023-01-09 15:27:40] <%Lourio> after that, fuck that shit
[2023-01-09 15:27:41] <JPSMO> i'm not even using a helm below lvl 4
[2023-01-09 15:27:42] <PickleFPS> @InnererKonflikt LUL I like that
[2023-01-09 15:27:46] <braydenhartter> Is m80 level 4 traders now?
[2023-01-09 15:27:50] <%Dialogue> i have a similar survival rate to you. although i only have about a quarter of the number of raids you do lol
[2023-01-09 15:27:52] <%+kushhmt> yo i just watched it again that guy literally jump peeked you on that corner just now smh
[2023-01-09 15:27:56] <VorlundCrow> BP should be find in raid only imo
[2023-01-09 15:27:56] <renodemron> imagine being able to play more than 3 guns and more than 2 calibers.. yea broring for sure KEKW
[2023-01-09 15:28:06] <%elmate715> Was that your first cheater today?

[2023-01-09 15:28:23] <EskimoBrather> but isnt 7.62x51mm NATO m80 a mid tier ammo? now its unaccessible for 80% of the playerbase for the entire wipe. there is also no craft below workbench3 @Klean
[2023-01-09 15:28:25] <%+MTReese_> Meta ammo needs to be FIR and super rare to spawn, and if it does spawn you only get 5

[2023-01-09 15:28:29] <toonami94> i have sinful thoughts on cheaters XD
[2023-01-09 15:28:30] <Maestro_Adam> had quite a few cheating incidents lately in my raids
[2023-01-09 15:28:31] <%+kushhmt> blatant
[2023-01-09 15:28:31] <Austin__Be__Saucin> this game just has no scarcity
[2023-01-09 15:28:32] <A_Saboteur> last time I cheated in a video game was vice city LUL
[2023-01-09 15:28:36] <+RebelFoxtrot> Well, blatant cheater anyways
[2023-01-09 15:28:39] <iceyfizzle> blatant cheater**
[2023-01-09 15:28:40] <+mcsouthstar> m80 is always viable
[2023-01-09 15:28:42] <%scruffyjash> kleanSmokin no cheat just smoke
[2023-01-09 15:28:46] <+Chimerical_Eclipse> M80 is viable all wipe
[2023-01-09 15:28:46] <%+Bows0108> it sucks how just dying to a cheater is part of the game now. its impossible to know if you're getting better when you go thru that
[2023-01-09 15:28:53] <+Fireballmx> m62 is top tier - it's meta for full auto .308
[2023-01-09 15:28:56] <%+EzPickenz1> Is 308 nozlr good?
[2023-01-09 15:28:56] <+Bear0nUnicycle> I think they need to completely nerf the extreme spread of gear performance. Too many 'levels' of armor and ammo etc.
[2023-01-09 15:28:56] <+GoochKnocker> M80 is strong, people just used M61 instead lol
[2023-01-09 15:29:00] <+BulletMagnetJoe> I havent heard someone use shitbag since i got out of the corps lol
[2023-01-09 15:29:01] <%LUCHAxLIVE> yo if fucking @KLEAN isnt getting daily cheaters, then the subreddit needs to check itself LUL
[2023-01-09 15:29:06] <%+kushhmt> sometimes you just get shot out of no where and youre not sure, and sometimes its super obvious like rn way
[2023-01-09 15:29:06] <gibalemga> desync sucks and peekers advantage in this game is not multiplayer ready :(
[2023-01-09 15:29:07] <+jinxplayer> as someone who only runs shit kits, the cheaters avoid me it seems
[2023-01-09 15:29:09] <%+kushhmt> was
[2023-01-09 15:29:09] <+Semipro_ttv> Should be found in raid or hideout you can make them
[2023-01-09 15:29:13] <TrixieKat> started my day in tarkov dying to Sektant in night factory, great
[2023-01-09 15:29:14] <lLo0py> lets go Pog
[2023-01-09 15:29:20] <lLo0py> 7.62 bp should also get removed NODDERS
[2023-01-09 15:29:22] <%Dialogue> 5.45 BP and PP is mid tier?
[2023-01-09 15:29:24] <+mcsouthstar> that's good because it makes level 5-6 armor way more valuable
[2023-01-09 15:29:24] <+danny_808_> can you still craft it in hideout??
[2023-01-09 15:29:27] <herbbug> can you still find it in game ?
[2023-01-09 15:29:29] <renodemron> the only thing that makes me sad is that playing with the boltaction now will be very difficult
[2023-01-09 15:29:35] <%+altezza300> I still gotta learn what ammo is worth picking up
[2023-01-09 15:29:37] <+deweyafterdark> Where are these patch notes?

[2023-01-09 15:29:41] <EskimoBrather> idk lvl3 peacekeeper is not early game in my opinion
[2023-01-09 15:29:47] <+jinxplayer> make flea level 20 or higher
[2023-01-09 15:29:47] <Thee_Smooth> @Dialogue they have almost the same stats, so yes
[2023-01-09 15:29:57] <A_Saboteur> The removal of high tier ammo makes armour have actual value and the TTK feels alot better
[2023-01-09 15:29:57] <%+kushhmt> itll make bosses easier late wipe
[2023-01-09 15:30:04] <dmrule> would it be ok to buy m61 for 15k a bullet on flee so I can use my dvl with it?
[2023-01-09 15:30:11] <ClayyFPS> i wish

[2023-01-09 15:30:16] <lentini72> W take for flea market
[2023-01-09 15:30:18] <%dmr06> remuv flea
[2023-01-09 15:30:20] <alexthecalm22s> m61 always my favorite ammo to craft, used to have 5 boxes of that thing. 6 red powder and and that rose thing.
[2023-01-09 15:30:20] <mr__spring> is it controversial that id prefer no lie market
[2023-01-09 15:30:20] <+RebelFoxtrot> Lvl 10 felt like the sweet spot out of all the different levels theyve tried.
[2023-01-09 15:30:29] <%+MTReese_> Low key make it so we can‚Äôt put ammo in the container
[2023-01-09 15:30:30] <ZanmanXx> yeah with all the stuff you can't sell on flea, it should be a lower level again absolutely
[2023-01-09 15:30:30] <The_Ryboy> early flee and make it food and meds only
[2023-01-09 15:30:34] <Gligoth> flea market is great
[2023-01-09 15:30:34] <+swiftytv> any news on battlebits release?
[2023-01-09 15:30:44] <VorlundCrow> Flea market is really good, but level 15 is too high given everything they've done to balance it over time.
[2023-01-09 15:30:45] <%jpep2raw> they'll never remove it, they put so much work into it, it isnt going anywhere
[2023-01-09 15:30:46] <PraeAster0th> Barter only flea tbh
[2023-01-09 15:30:46] <gibalemga> flee market levels
[2023-01-09 15:30:47] <Thee_Smooth> the flea aint going now where, BSG spent to much effort in it and they always double dwn
[2023-01-09 15:30:54] <+VladuFTW> @Klean scav time should be reduced with at least 50% until lvl 10, will be so good for new players
[2023-01-09 15:30:55] <Tostiii> that would be horrible
[2023-01-09 15:30:56] <%+altezza300> what about making flea an in-raid trader?
[2023-01-09 15:30:56] <gibalemga> that would be very cool ;)
[2023-01-09 15:30:59] <trashcan_thief> flea market is great if you can't buy end game stuff
[2023-01-09 15:31:01] <brethalamue> Haven't played this wipe. What level does the flea open this wipe?
[2023-01-09 15:31:04] <jungshad0w> flea takes away some of the RNG which can bog the game down
[2023-01-09 15:31:07] <+hyrulianlink15> there is a rep I thought
[2023-01-09 15:31:10] <+mcsouthstar> it's not in a good state imo, because loot tables are way too generous, so it operates effectively like traders for a lot of items
[2023-01-09 15:31:10] [Announcement] <Nightbot> Twitter: https://bit.ly/3phjP7U | Instagram: https://bit.ly/2kiwiuo | TikTok: https://bit.ly/3PpXnnI | YouTube: https://bit.ly/3Ak7Nkv
[2023-01-09 15:31:14] <+hyrulianlink15> that's how you can sell more items
[2023-01-09 15:31:14] <PickleFPS> made 5mil yesterday on scav runs and I don't even have the flea, but looking forward to it
[2023-01-09 15:31:14] <edelsan> Upgrading the hideout before unlocking the flea market was painful... It should be lvl 10
[2023-01-09 15:31:15] <+Semipro_ttv> 45 acp and ap6.3 to easy for lvl 3 pk
[2023-01-09 15:31:20] <+sully8680> the cost to sell keys on flea needs a fix
[2023-01-09 15:31:24] <Tostiii> and the game is in bad state
[2023-01-09 15:31:25] <%+kushhmt> or just start off only able to do one item at a time and level that up\
[2023-01-09 15:31:26] <PraeAster0th> Does anyone know what ammo changes have happened?
[2023-01-09 15:31:35] <%+X_D_Evaporator> Good morning everyone kleanKool

[2023-01-09 15:31:43] <+VladuFTW> @Klean scav time should be reduced with at least 50% until lvl 10, will be so good for new players, what u think?
[2023-01-09 15:31:46] <IdolOfRot> I like to tinker with guns so without flea i think i wouldnt be bothered to keep playing this
[2023-01-09 15:31:48] <zilthemill> @kushhmt as long as it doesnt take 10 years to unlock the next slot..
[2023-01-09 15:32:04] <+iiifrit> would the game not get boring in a week cheating? I see the motive behind rmt mfs for $ but what about the 15 year old that just knower voiped you then quad hs?
[2023-01-09 15:32:22] <+hyrulianlink15> I thought they did have a flea market levels
[2023-01-09 15:32:25] <lLo0py> indeed NODDERS
[2023-01-09 15:32:26] <mr__spring> good
[2023-01-09 15:32:31] <Thee_Smooth> Based.
[2023-01-09 15:32:32] <+RebelFoxtrot> Truuuuue, I would love that.
[2023-01-09 15:32:33] <jungshad0w> unless they lock all high tier ammo it will just switch around the meta
[2023-01-09 15:32:38] <+thetonyt> very good idea.
[2023-01-09 15:32:38] <%+kushhmt> lol yeah gotta be a better way to level it up other than selling items, maybe like roubles made overall @zilthemill
[2023-01-09 15:32:38] <+BD5150> W Take
[2023-01-09 15:32:39] <TrixieKat> i agree with that take
[2023-01-09 15:32:39] <edelsan> That would be awesome!
[2023-01-09 15:32:40] <szu_the_snake> good take
[2023-01-09 15:32:42] <+hyrulianlink15> should be a choice
[2023-01-09 15:32:43] <+VladuFTW> @Klean perfectly, we found the solution
[2023-01-09 15:32:43] <+t3hgame331> Agreed
[2023-01-09 15:32:45] <%+kevsabot> 1000%
[2023-01-09 15:32:47] <+DamBuster46> thats an awesome idea, its so easy to scav and money run on the same map

[2023-01-09 15:32:48] <%LUCHAxLIVE> @iiifrit some people only get their serotonin from upsetting other people because they themselves are very sad
[2023-01-09 15:32:50] <%Gavlakel> that would be cool
[2023-01-09 15:32:51] <%+N3ON_LEMON> They also need to make scavs killing scavs have a more severe punishment. People just don't care about scav rep this wipe it seems.
[2023-01-09 15:33:00] <zilthemill> but then we weak PC fellows would have to play streets and lighthouse FeelsCheekiMan
[2023-01-09 15:33:01] <+jinxplayer> god damn
[2023-01-09 15:33:03] <NeverNewd> wait, so did BSG listen to you Klean and remove all Meta ammo from traders?
[2023-01-09 15:33:04] <+Swiftlemur> would stop player scavs just hitting interchange over and over again too.

[2023-01-09 15:44:18] <Vengeancemk1> Reddit is mostly scum-dwelling neckbeards anyway.

[2023-01-09 15:44:24] <alexthecalm22s> I'm sure you know the song Wish by Sect Unit, but I don't think I ever heard it here.
[2023-01-09 15:44:30] <NeverNewd> reddit in general is just fucking bad. so many bots regurgitating the same bullshit opinions.

[2023-01-09 15:44:40] <vviljami> EFT and Path of Exile reddit's are something else. PoE devs recently just abandoned that place a while ago. Such a vile places.
[2023-01-09 15:44:44] <%Thewaterlord27> Rimworld and Victoria 2 subreddits are pretty neat.
[2023-01-09 15:44:44] <+RebelFoxtrot> @thesunabsolute I'll take all memes over what it is now. Every other post is either praising the game, or hating the game, or hating those that hate the game, or hating those that praise the game.

[2023-01-09 16:53:57] <%lord_ubah> yesterday I had a scav run where 2 player scavs tried to kill me but missed their shots, I killed them and got the penalty twice, rough
[2023-01-09 16:53:58] <@%carleegtx> @SigurdWZ KEKW Is he going to work today?
[2023-01-09 16:54:05] <+Cipher_Encrypt> It was funny when the dorm scav was following ur order

[2023-01-09 16:54:08] <pixzrr> Scavs have m555a1 and will one tap you
[2023-01-09 16:54:09] <HeroFx> did they nerf scavs?
[2023-01-09 16:54:14] <Dulius6> It was so fun
[2023-01-09 16:54:15] <%SigurdWZ> @carleegtx unlikely but hopefully lmao

[2023-01-09 16:55:04] <%+KatDaddy_> is there anything that shows pmc kills when you are on your scav? thats a stat i could get behind
[2023-01-09 16:55:07] <%SigurdWZ> @carleegtx I did variety, but no joke. Strawberry Kiwi is AMAZING
[2023-01-09 16:55:10] <Painkiller> shattered mask was like that for a wipe
[2023-01-09 16:55:30] <@%+cubezgg> @KatDaddy_ I think while you're on your scav you can check your overall stats in game
[2023-01-09 16:55:32] <pixzrr> @ukly0 yeah I have been 1 tappped by a scav with m855a1
[2023-01-09 16:55:35] <@%carleegtx> @SigurdWZ ok bet. anything to compare it too? like is it close to alani nu?

[2023-01-09 16:57:00] <TheBradest> My only complaint is that I wish they'd implement this stuff at start of wipe

[2023-01-09 16:57:10] <MAGSWAP> @klean as a casual this is actually great for us. Never could get them off traders anyway

[2023-01-09 16:57:29] <@%+cubezgg> @SirKrall2 a good amount of the community are meta slaves, so no they don't like the changes
[2023-01-09 16:57:29] <grouillotdfk> I doubt streamers are influence over Nikita lol
[2023-01-09 16:57:39] <+reggatv> What happened chat?
[2023-01-09 16:57:42] <%lord_ubah> I'm ready for the return of Dwarf Fortress streams
[2023-01-09 16:57:42] <+Tethtizan> you thinking you might unlock lightkeeper this wipe or is that not a goal?
[2023-01-09 16:57:48] <pixzrr> I‚Äôm just fucking with you tho
[2023-01-09 16:57:49] <Cpt_SpicyWeiner> @grouillotdfk they did in the past
[2023-01-09 16:57:50] <@%carleegtx> @Klean maybe people get separation anxiety when you leave. It sounds like the EFT community has daddy issues.
[2023-01-09 16:57:50] <kakers0n> I'm a little butt hurt, but it definitely is the right move the longevity of the wipe

[2023-01-09 16:57:53] <knapton0413> variety is the spice of life
[2023-01-09 16:57:59] <jegkenderdigsarah> If the difference between Meta players, and noobs like me is sooooo big, you¬¥lll have to implement RMM. So changing Meta bullet availability is the key:)
[2023-01-09 16:57:59] <%$dennydsoach> kotton abandonded it lol
[2023-01-09 16:57:59] <+brewskiigaming> relax and let the man play games

[2023-01-09 16:58:01] <%+Dirtymitts> LUL people are allowed to play more than 1 game. I never got that
[2023-01-09 16:58:01] <colin29> I just don't get how they can see the big picture that it's good for longevity of the wipe @Klean
[2023-01-09 16:58:01] <+Senpai_Onyx> One meta gets nerfed and another rises. The cycle continues - Tarkov is the shittiest best game ever

[2023-01-09 16:59:07] <+F1toaster> literally only thing i want you to do mr klean is hit nikita around the head and get the anti cheat crew back together to manually ban people again. It won't eliminate the issue but would help. Been killed by 2 aladdin hackers today
[2023-01-09 16:59:07] <n9pe_> dog, dad, wife in that order

[2023-01-09 16:59:20] <knapton0413> I think anything you've planted your flag has been positive for the game.
[2023-01-09 16:59:21] <%+Dirtymitts> I legit found Valheim from watching you play it here - thanks for that @Klean
[2023-01-09 16:59:22] <+aeva4eva> Sounds like they have abandonment  issues

[2023-01-09 16:59:25] <ZanmanXx> people love to bitch about Tarkov, no matter what BSG does there's gonna be a minority who hates it, they literally can't win
[2023-01-09 16:59:25] <%ekozaur> There's a thing in my line of work. Whenever we're almost done with a project, last 100m dash, we always get one of our peers to shadow us on that project and they 100% of the time find new issues that we've always missed. Fresh pair of eyes and someone who's not stuffed on something see things in a broader perspective
[2023-01-09 16:59:28] <ezraa_h> wait so what got changed? i just tuned in @Klean
[2023-01-09 16:59:29] <DutchGeorge> i have 2 red flares, what is the best way/map/time to call them in?
[2023-01-09 16:59:29] <Drizzt___> meta ammo gone after all the streamers filled their ammo boxes ü¶Äü¶Ä
[2023-01-09 16:59:30] <+AntoniusJD> my only complaint is they often make these kind of changes mid wipe when they should've been ironed out before hand @Klean
[2023-01-09 16:59:34] <Devgrusome> @lumi_666 S tier ammo like 7.62 BP and others are being taken from Traders and only raid/hideout items now.
[2023-01-09 16:59:36] <Cpt_SpicyWeiner> wait.. so you cant get impact from barter also now ??

[2023-01-09 17:01:32] <yoscar__> what i dont understand is why they dont make level 5 and 6 harder to get, you can literally get it day 1 of the wipe by legging tagilla

[2023-01-09 17:02:16] <j4rra> @callsignwarhound thanks
[2023-01-09 17:02:21] <Dulius6> A mini killa body armor
[2023-01-09 17:02:26] <%SigurdWZ> YES!
[2023-01-09 17:02:27] <+F1toaster> literally only thing i want you to do mr klean is hit nikita around the head and get the anti cheat crew back together to manually ban people again. It won't eliminate the issue but would help. Been killed by 2 aladdin hackers today. The reddit (albeit a cringe place) is pages after pages of people getting cheated on. It's almost like an advertisement campaign @Klean
[2023-01-09 17:02:31] <%+IR0GUE_> hey kleanTUBES
[2023-01-09 17:02:31] <%$dennydsoach> dont you get tagged and cursed if you go into  a raid with just a hatchet? @Klean
[2023-01-09 17:02:34] <knapton0413> desentivise farming?
[2023-01-09 17:02:34] <Legendary_Rat> reshala not having his pistol is the worst feeling
[2023-01-09 17:02:37] <cryptopeasants> Hex and Slick should be only found in raid
[2023-01-09 17:03:00] <Cpt_SpicyWeiner> @Sam_Hall_ no JK.. it leaves your stomach exposed
[2023-01-09 17:03:02] <+XenoShade8> ive killed Tagilla with strandhog

[2023-01-09 17:03:13] <+baamang> I still have yet to get a customs raid with reshala
[2023-01-09 17:03:13] <+Fireballmx> they gave tagilla that strandhogg at least
[2023-01-09 17:03:23] <%SigurdWZ> @Klean it's really an easy thing to do, they just need to make a check after X amount of days of new wipe - change armor roll to xx
[2023-01-09 17:03:35] <yoscar__> @yoscar__ still to easy to get high tier armour imo, raiders are still easy to find
[2023-01-09 17:03:35] <+mr__matla> aha so you did ban me ! JK
[2023-01-09 17:03:39] <Maestro_Adam> a stream of reviewing footage would be awesome to watch
[2023-01-09 17:03:46] <Devgrusome> @cryptopeasants found Hex and Slick yesterday in stache and weapon cache on Interchange... first time ever finding those items, let alone in same raid!

[2023-01-09 17:04:12] <Painkiller> I would love manual review team
[2023-01-09 17:04:17] <cryptopeasants> ya but on ragman u can get them with like 300k
[2023-01-09 17:04:18] <%+KodEVO> Agree
[2023-01-09 17:04:19] <%$dennydsoach> it think it should be like JURY duty to AVOID bias
[2023-01-09 17:04:19] <MAGSWAP> @klean really could use a after raid replay mode
[2023-01-09 17:04:24] <+ayymikeayy> it would be cool to have an Overwatch system like CSGO
[2023-01-09 17:04:26] <cryptopeasants> that is problem
[2023-01-09 17:04:31] <DatHarass> i was under the impression BSG doesnt care
[2023-01-09 17:04:33] <%+DrFartAton> BSG doest care tho
[2023-01-09 17:04:39] <%+DrFartAton> doesnt*
[2023-01-09 17:04:43] <+way_back> Just go on Tik Tok and see 1,000's of cheats being adverstied. Why does BSG not look into this? All of them have discord links as well
[2023-01-09 17:04:48] <Painkiller> you'd have to have select people on it tho, cause false bans from people
[2023-01-09 17:04:52] <%+Ergotic33> does BSG care or doesnt care??
[2023-01-09 17:04:54] <DrDazzle925> Im sorry if this has been explained already, but what ammo is gone? just from Flea, or traders too?
[2023-01-09 17:04:56] <+Fireballmx> @drfartaton false
[2023-01-09 17:04:56] <Cpt_SpicyWeiner> @Klean but then they buy a new account .. over and over
[2023-01-09 17:04:58] <%+IR0GUE_> @klean saw your dts video...good thing. i turn on dts in sound blaster driver software, the improvement is really huge!
[2023-01-09 17:04:59] <%RyseUpGaming> like the hacker timmy killed the other day
[2023-01-09 17:04:59] <Painkiller> for the non 100% ones
[2023-01-09 17:05:00] <strongbox> remember the csgo community review thing? that was good and would help
[2023-01-09 17:05:01] <%+KodEVO> @dennydsoach Does it need to be against bias though? If thats not how the game is intended to be the developer should be able to make that call
[2023-01-09 17:05:02] <%SigurdWZ> @Klean The things I would do for that.
[2023-01-09 17:05:04] <+SmokingMeowt> I was watching utopiagaming and I saw a dude floating along, getting head shot repeatedly and didn't die

[2023-01-09 17:05:39] <+F1toaster> honestly would just nice to see some humans doing something about it ya know. For me on EU servers its the worst I've seen it. I can't imagine the amount of 'cleaver' cheaters there are hiding it. Because I've never had so many aladdin rage hacker cheaters actively voiping me about it @Klean
[2023-01-09 17:05:40] <mrdabbyduck> look at all the changes to rmt, they care and wanna stop it
[2023-01-09 17:05:42] <@%+cubezgg> @iPsykotic IP and hardware can be spoofed
[2023-01-09 17:05:43] <druwpa> My favorite take is bundle deals like bro cheaters dont buy bundles
[2023-01-09 17:05:44] <Cpt_SpicyWeiner> @Daanootje BUT less players
[2023-01-09 17:05:45] <+FatherOwens> People have zero clue about Game development
[2023-01-09 17:05:46] <knapton0413> Every dev hates cheaters why would anyone.

[2023-01-09 17:05:51] <+F1toaster> defo would love a manual review team back
[2023-01-09 17:05:52] <Merc_The_Jerk> a kill cam would need to be added to review after the raid. having one available right when you die wouldn't work well... would just give 2+ PMC groups info on where the enemy is for callouts
[2023-01-09 17:05:54] <%+PapaCapp_> kleanWee
[2023-01-09 17:05:54] <%The1SlyFox> @Klean do they not have a discord / community manager like pubg where 'partner' level streamers can report players?
[2023-01-09 17:05:55] <+syphon_ac007> why not have to enter your DL # or some form of id when you register to play and if you're banned you're banned 4ever

[2023-01-09 17:05:57] <%+titch444> bsg should set Damirka on these cheaters xD

[2023-01-09 17:06:50] <+FatherOwens> @FatsoMulatso of course they are man. but they would MAKE MORE if they didnt have cheateres come on man

[2023-01-09 17:06:53] <@%+cubezgg> @DrDazzle925 I think you can for m856a1 and m80s but they're not really being sold, I could be wrong though

[2023-01-09 17:08:04] <+FatsoMulatso> @FatherOwens i absolutely agree.  i just think it's very sus that you can buy 5 accounts in a bundle on sale after almost every ban wave
[2023-01-09 17:08:05] <+FatherOwens> @FatsoMulatso you think if you asked BSG right now if they would rather have a  cheat-free solution or not, what do you think they would choose

[2023-01-09 17:08:14] <Cpt_SpicyWeiner> bsg should hire a team of cheaters and pay them just to kill other cheaters and leave the raid.. over and over LUL .. imagine

[2023-01-09 17:08:43] <%+DrFartAton> BSG has other higher priorities, they def do not like cheaters, but they will not prioritize them either
[2023-01-09 17:08:46] <%+N3ON_LEMON> @XHighHammerX which is exactly why making up a random stat like "7/10 players are cheaters" is completely stupid.

[2023-01-09 17:12:44] <+F1toaster> i feel like a minor nerf on those things. Like 1 purchase every 12hrs maybe.
[2023-01-09 17:12:47] <+Sam_Hall_> @XHighHammerX I don't need intelligence to realize you're just frustrated and making bs claims because you die a lot. it's okay mate, take a breather from EFT and touch some grass.
[2023-01-09 17:12:48] <%+titch444> this is why tarky is so unique imo.. you are playing the same thing over and over and over.. but the experience is completely different every wipe and every raid too etc
[2023-01-09 17:12:51] <%+N3ON_LEMON> @FatsoMulatso there's always a way to circumvent anti cheats. So that's a moot point.
[2023-01-09 17:12:55] <CrackGamer> i've always been saving the weapon mods i use no matter how many i have
[2023-01-09 17:12:58] <+Terry_Connor44> maybe they should remove all mosin ammo from the dealer since its all 4 class
[2023-01-09 17:12:58] <+chnkp> @klean I agree. Usually 1 month into the wipe and everybody just got 1 tap from anywhere with vudu / razor and m61
[2023-01-09 17:13:00] <callmechaddy> So what have they done to the Razor/Vudu? I missed that part
[2023-01-09 17:13:12] <kinkyriot> gonna sting the dick so much more to lose those cool and rare attachments to some flying dipshit selling it on ebay LUL

[2023-01-09 17:13:18] <+Happycoin> tbh if Vudu and razor is going for much on the flea i would rather sell it and use one of the otherones
[2023-01-09 17:13:27] <t3hMaraud3r> wait, just logged in, what ammo is gone?
[2023-01-09 17:13:34] <+Sam_Hall_> @Happycoin 100k right now
[2023-01-09 17:13:37] <+Dwayneswrld> I like the changes, but feel bad for my buds that have no gotten to max traders before. Feels like they are starting to transition away from the 6 month wipe cycle stuff.

[2023-01-09 17:15:59] <%Swako21> idk if anyone noticed but scav weapons (bot at least) have low durability but repairable, like 50 of 94, making them actually usable on your pmc kleanMmm
[2023-01-09 17:16:00] <callsignwarhound> @Klean We definitely need some supply disruptions

[2023-01-09 17:16:08] <+Dwayneswrld> I started rocking the bravo and fast fire dot on top to mix it up from the variable zooms. Looks like it was a good move

[2023-01-09 17:20:37] <+hellooointernet> have you encountered many cheaters this wipe? The subreddit makes it seem like the game is completely unplayable
[2023-01-09 17:20:39] <+ProfessorSquatch> @ProfessorSquatch I mean in terms of should it even be possible? I feel like that's part of why wipes get stale after a month or two
[2023-01-09 17:20:41] <SnakeEyes97> Thats my fav part spending 2 hours inspecting everything LUL
[2023-01-09 17:20:42] <+MockChozen1> Lmao I went thru the flea last night for an entire hour just inspecting stuff

[2023-01-09 17:20:58] <+surfeit> have they fixed the armor repair case... i've repairing with 0/1200 for the last week? @Klean
[2023-01-09 17:21:04] <+Happycoin> would be awesome to have an inspect all in trader inventories, so you dont sit there for half an hour every wipe
[2023-01-09 17:21:09] <@%Ripper203> @MegaDude_ That would be nice
[2023-01-09 17:21:12] <ToeheadTy> Should just be an inspect all option on the traders.

[2023-01-09 17:23:20] <@%Ripper203> @MegaDude_ Yeah it really is, it's the main reason I just leave it on the laser&light setting and just have it on or off

[2023-01-09 17:23:23] <%lord_ubah> the wipe is getting closer to the "full sprint to player spawns every match" part

[2023-01-09 17:23:24] <t3hMaraud3r> dude, expanding on the early wipe gameplay is sooooooo good
[2023-01-09 17:23:31] <callsignwarhound> @Klean Just thought about it, Lightkeeper would be a good way to regulate the high tier stuff.

[2023-01-09 17:28:48] <%+Pwnappl3> yeah its a good change for gunsmith and stuff too
[2023-01-09 17:28:49] <Robzy_> US has high flesh dmg and less recoil

[2023-01-09 17:29:25] <MAGSWAP> @klean if you bind free look to something else. LCtrl for example, use it to freelook and right click you can do the scope glitch without opening the inventory. Helps with doing it on the fly.
[2023-01-09 17:29:25] <Zozark> no igolnik?

[2023-01-09 17:31:52] <cannarelladream> do you always have to reset the fov trick. I find when i do it i gotta redo it like 5 mins later@klean
[2023-01-09 17:31:54] <@%+cubezgg> @Legendary_Rat They already know about it, so its not a hotfix and its not exactly gamebreaking either

[2023-01-09 17:32:21] <TrashlKitten> instead of people a d strafing people circle strafe now to get around the inertia
[2023-01-09 17:32:24] <$MceeOG> @JoshuaGuzz he did recently

[2023-01-09 17:35:27] <Legendary_Rat> @samuel_o34 always did, they probably just send the full auto sound for the server for a really short period of time

[2023-01-09 17:38:15] <+ttam1534> They should actually make Comtacs authentic to how they‚Äôre used IRL. As in if you don‚Äôt use them, you can hear sounds more clearly and can better hear things directioanally, but when you shoot you‚Äôre hearing gets blown out. But when you do wear them you lose a little bit of directionally but they don‚Äôt ‚Äúenhance‚Äù your hearing, they just cut off the loud sounds so you don‚Äôt blow your ears out

[2023-01-09 17:51:17] <%filthy_franco69> @Micholous KEKW I agree with Klean; no way anyone should be able to just know they can run a meta loadout every 3 hours or less.
[2023-01-09 17:51:36] <einsztein> I love the new changes! they should be more aggressive like you said and make  all the "meta" rounds FIR

[2023-01-09 17:53:20] <sjkTV> I think if a team mate picks up your gear to insure it, it should be void
[2023-01-09 17:53:24] <sjkTV> to hide it*
[2023-01-09 17:53:25] <%filthy_franco69> @countryttv 100% agree

[2023-01-09 17:53:31] <colin29> @Klean The Cycle does similar to that. If your friend touches your stuff, you don't get it back in insurance
[2023-01-09 17:53:33] <Optimus_Servo> make the stuff come back more damaged since it was exposed to the elements until it was "recovered"

[2023-01-09 17:54:09] <fibonacchoz> one thing that the cycle did decent with insurance with teams is it voids once your teammate picks it up so if they die trying to get out you dont get it
[2023-01-09 17:54:15] <%filthy_franco69> @colin29 I think soon as your teammate touches your gear it should work like The Cycle.
[2023-01-09 17:54:19] <+Swiftlemur> I've been doing no insurance for the past few wipes, it feels nice to know what is gone is gone, lets you prioritise your stash, not expecting that stuff might come back. + insurance is mad cash now.

[2023-01-09 17:54:40] <%filthy_franco69> I also think a change like that where you teammate couldnt dump gear would make players want to scav more
[2023-01-09 17:54:55] <CerealKillerDude> @cubezgg thanks, I don't see any pinned message
[2023-01-09 17:54:56] <%ElPonete> Klean what do you think about to include some mechanic to walk faster when you AIM? I think its in Ground Branch game.
[2023-01-09 17:55:07] <@%+cubezgg> @CerealKillerDude Ahh all good

[2023-01-09 17:56:31] <%+phergoshop> is $0.69 a round for range safe 5.56 a good price in todays world or is that really steep?
[2023-01-09 17:56:36] <+Utah_Hockey> Isn‚Äôt insurance in the lore something like your PMC paying scavs to go in and retrieve your gear? If so, perhaps a balancing change could be made where the chance the scavs succeed in retrieving your gear is impacted by your Scav Rep? Like the higher your Rep, the greater percent chance you have at getting your stuff back and vice versa
[2023-01-09 17:56:54] <+RebelFoxtrot> Zero Hour does this perfectly. Short guns and pistols can suck up to doors and others can't.
[2023-01-09 17:56:56] <Ultimate__Ace> yeah Ergo needs to actually matter.

[2023-01-09 17:57:20] <MAGSWAP> @klean would give incentive to fold your stock too
[2023-01-09 17:57:20] <+zainegardner> Wait, they took that mechanic out? I didn't know that
[2023-01-09 17:57:22] <%stealthyhazboola> they had that?!
[2023-01-09 17:57:23] <+hellooointernet> it's because of redditors crying
[2023-01-09 17:57:25] <+Magni2des> always thought the secure container should be a drone you call in, so limited use per raid, and insurance should require you to barter trade with the scav who recovers your gear
[2023-01-09 17:57:25] <%Jeppe_Helt> @Utah_Hockey thats just not how its works ingame wise, if you die and the loot is left on the map when the raid ends, you get it back

[2023-01-09 18:20:39] <Micholous> dont think it will boost much of flea prices tho eh?
[2023-01-09 18:20:41] <KJ_MiLLi> Does anyone know where the jager quest to kill ppl factory window etc went? I‚Äôm level 27 and haven‚Äôt gotten it that‚Äôs never happened
[2023-01-09 18:20:47] <%+LastJarOfMayo> @klean whatever happened to that rap Playlist you started to help out smaller creators? you still listen to any of them?
[2023-01-09 18:20:48] <CALL811BEFOREYOUDIG> @gibalemga no
[2023-01-09 18:20:51] <GrandpaClamps> @gibalemga on most maps, no, not yet. Its broken.

[2023-01-09 18:21:20] <MAGSWAP> @gibalemga last I heard it was causing some performance issues so use it if it's what you like and doesn't ruin fps for you
[2023-01-09 18:21:27] <+Jawln> I give it 8 hours until people complain about the leg meta
[2023-01-09 18:21:37] <%+countryttv> @GrandpaClamps to add on to that, i think there should be equal quest lines between scav and pmc, make it harder for scav but equal or better incentives would be sick imo
[2023-01-09 18:22:11] <GrandpaClamps> Don't use Binaural. There is a new test video out that showed significantly reduced ability to judge direction currently with it on.

[2023-01-09 18:23:42] <GrandpaClamps> @countryttv i'm sure I'd agree with you, except I'm too new to have opinions on the state of the game. I just know I'm getting my ass kicked. lol.
[2023-01-09 18:23:45] <%+countryttv> @GrandpaClamps which if im not mistaken Klean has spoken about, the fact that there will be a whole scav storyline if not quests and shit, when eventually, maybe, indefinably this game goes 1.0 KEKW

[2023-01-09 18:25:00] <+matthewoleary01> Do you think the ammo change just forces players to use PS 7.62 for longer?
[2023-01-09 18:25:02] <callsignwarhound> @MAGSWAP USEC Raiders will attack groups that have BEARs in them. USEC and BEAR only locations are planned along with a bunch of other stuff.
[2023-01-09 18:25:16] <bert_shoelace> Thank you @Klean for running not meta sights all the time :) love it

[2023-01-09 18:25:45] <Mira1320> You absolute shitter, wow yet again a streamer cryin and getting what he wants out of twitter posts. Your takes are horrendous, making ammo fir or craft only is dumb as hell. As if you dont work for it already thru tasks, leveling and desk slams later. You're the kind to purposely use a dogshit ammo, get mopped for example by someone using 855a1 and class 5 then cry cuz you couldnt compete when high tier ammo was available and you coulda used it but instead whine
[2023-01-09 18:25:45] <%+countryttv> @GrandpaClamps i find that scav raid are 100% less stressful cause its all free gear anyways right? if you spawn with a sick ass key or something then yeah it ups the anty a little bit.

[2023-01-09 19:01:44] <%RyseUpGaming> AI should respond to voip that would be siiick

[2023-01-09 19:19:26] <%stealthyhazboola> It will be disappointing if sound is not addressed within the next wipe, I hope its priority

[2023-01-09 19:29:13] <%+TacticoolChopsticks> @klean what do you think about BSG making moderate changes to maps every wipe?? Changing POI‚Äôs and shit on maps.
[2023-01-09 19:29:14] <+RebelFoxtrot> @proscribed_tvf LUL you really think they got someone in the office plotting and scheming on how to make money off cheaters? LMFAO
[2023-01-09 19:29:20] <%Hayeser> i think in an mmo play time should still be king
[2023-01-09 19:29:24] <BISHOPxB95> thats the whole point of skills and stuff right
[2023-01-09 19:29:27] <+pnwrat> and thats how its gonna be again lol

[2023-01-09 19:29:32] <ScruffMAGuff_> ...isn't that how it is suppose to be?? You put in the time so you should be rewarded. huh
[2023-01-09 19:29:38] <%stealthyhazboola> Id say thats ok, good for you for putting on work in a video game
[2023-01-09 19:29:40] <+syphon_ac007> which is honestly how many hrs most people play

[2023-01-09 19:29:47] <+Bear0nUnicycle> I just think the difference between the entry level gear and the top level gear is way too much. Could solve so many issues by just squishing all the stats at both ends.

[2023-01-09 20:05:04] <+HueyBot> Playing mostly solo you do need to move quickly but carefully and efficiently.
[2023-01-09 20:05:08] <+oshin1> I'm really bad at locating people via sound
[2023-01-09 20:05:15] <%+aamef> Fine line between great comms and just too much talking. Short and precise.

[2023-01-09 20:07:17] <FourTones> Comparison, the thief of joy
[2023-01-09 20:07:30] <+PojehsR6> its human nature to be competitive, thats kinda redundent
[2023-01-09 20:07:33] <kennysexman> @ekozaur modded dayz
[2023-01-09 20:07:38] <%$dennydsoach> MURDER ON THE MIND lol
[2023-01-09 20:08:29] <%ekozaur> @kennysexman with base building? all of them have some sort of purge day or C4 or random siege hours/days

[2023-01-09 20:09:15] <%$dennydsoach> sorry to backseat lol
[2023-01-09 20:09:21] <CEOofDripHam00d> LUL they are complaining about space in SICC cases while Standart edition gamers spend  half an hour after every death
[2023-01-09 20:09:21] <kennysexman> @ekozaur he said safe space which traders are safe zones
[2023-01-09 20:10:21] <+PojehsR6> what does he mean meta ammo gone?
[2023-01-09 20:10:26] <%ekozaur> @kennysexman nah man, I was talking about a safe space as in MY safe space. A base that nobody can rush through
[2023-01-09 20:10:32] <@%+cubezgg> @PojehsR6 check the pinned message
[2023-01-09 20:10:57] <kennysexman> @ekozaur your base is YOUR safe space, just dont build a bad one..
[2023-01-09 20:10:57] <%+aamef> @CEOofDripHam00d That's a bad comparison since all players can use SICC cases.

[2023-01-09 20:11:53] <+HueyBot> It is weird champ when you put it that way. I think arena will fix a lot of the bored chad woes
[2023-01-09 20:11:58] <Dahl0012> The real question is, why does the game even show you your kd
[2023-01-09 20:11:59] <+Mokeskiii> as a timmy, i nearly creamed my pants finishing stirrup in 1 raid EZ
[2023-01-09 20:12:08] <%+aamef> Yeah, if people are flexing their K/D then they should also show their "PMCs killed" stat LUL
[2023-01-09 20:12:09] <Micholous> @PojehsR6  we understand, you have R6 in your name <3 (jk love you)

[2023-01-09 20:12:31] <kennysexman> @ekozaur if you couldnt raid bases in dayz the game would be boring and dead
[2023-01-09 20:12:32] <+Mokeskiii> @LabMade maybe for RMT freaks unfortunately
[2023-01-09 20:12:38] <%+MunkE8> I played with a dude that had a 80% survival rate but only had 150 pmc kills
[2023-01-09 20:12:40] <+PojehsR6> @Micholous lol exactly, sadly i play this game now and my depression has only gotten worse
[2023-01-09 20:12:44] <%+xDeltrix> @Mokeskiii thats Pog that quest do be a nightmare sometimes

[2023-01-09 20:13:03] <+Mokeskiii> @xDeltrix did it on factory lol i was ecstatic!!
[2023-01-09 20:13:09] <Micholous> @PojehsR6  same... same.  peepoSad
[2023-01-09 20:13:34] <+HueyBot> I've never even gotten close to 100 PMC kills in a wipe, but I play almost exclusively solo and average like high 20/low 30 level.
[2023-01-09 20:13:47] <$kalose_vonhammer> summits gonna be mad about the 45 ap going away i dont think hes leveled his hideout much
[2023-01-09 20:14:04] <+Mokeskiii> @teesk1 i just think the RMT nerds and cheaters will abuse any game mode that is competitive and makes them in game money
[2023-01-09 20:14:05] <+PojehsR6> @Micholous yeah i leave R6 for the cheater epidemic to come to tarkov lol what a terrible choice i made
[2023-01-09 20:14:20] <%+aamef> @HueyBot And that's perfectly fine, this game can be played in many ways, you don't have to chase PVP.
[2023-01-09 20:14:21] <%+IR0GUE_> are you able to install dts unbound on win11?
[2023-01-09 20:14:24] <+teesk1> @Mokeskiii how is arenas going to encourage rmt? there is no looting
[2023-01-09 20:14:28] <%+MunkE8> @HueyBot but youre not talking like you own at the game, big difference
[2023-01-09 20:14:31] <%+aamef> @IR0GUE_ Yes, via store.
[2023-01-09 20:14:33] <+BazHicks> @teesk1 arena wont make them in game money, its completely seperate
[2023-01-09 20:14:42] <+teesk1> ^
[2023-01-09 20:14:44] <Micholous> @PojehsR6  hahahaha sameeeee its so bad
[2023-01-09 20:14:47] <Micholous> i love it
[2023-01-09 20:14:53] <@%+cubezgg> @teesk1 you don't "extract" with gear in arenas
[2023-01-09 20:14:57] <%+IR0GUE_> @aamef and where do you enabeld it in the menu?
[2023-01-09 20:14:59] VIEWERS: 2¬†735
[2023-01-09 20:15:05] <+teesk1> @Mokeskiii arenas is literally just PVP where does rmt come in
[2023-01-09 20:15:06] <+Mokeskiii> @teesk1 but you have to pay for your gear, and i'd assume the winner of the arena match gets money, but not sure on that. imo it will be a cheater hotspot

[2023-01-09 20:15:19] <+HueyBot> Fair. I'm not super competent at PvP, but I like the idea of a game state where you aren't necessarily forced to do PvP but it's maybe incentivized more.
[2023-01-09 20:15:20] <%Lourio> great comms
[2023-01-09 20:15:24] <%+aamef> @IR0GUE_ Open your sound settings and it should show as a input

[2023-01-09 20:15:38] <+SlickHitter1414> u can bring gear in from your main eft account in arena. they already said this

[2023-01-09 20:21:52] <+De4dMaNz> but walls is 100% probly the most common form of cheat on this map
[2023-01-09 20:21:58] <+krispycreammmmm> Sup y‚Äôall smoketvHi
[2023-01-09 20:22:05] <Pac_ThaMan> if they have wall hacks.. they have aimbot
[2023-01-09 20:22:11] <+teesk1> walls is the most common cheat across all games probably
[2023-01-09 20:22:15] <@%+cubezgg> @Pac_ThaMan not always
[2023-01-09 20:22:16] <%Lourio> dont forget his bag :)
[2023-01-09 20:22:18] <aranzaboi> is that aug mag marked?????

[2023-01-09 20:22:24] <+teesk1> @Pac_ThaMan not true, if they want to be discreet which many do
[2023-01-09 20:22:24] <+freak__sh0w> if you cheat you suck

[2023-01-09 20:22:57] <+KronikGaming7o7> Not going to lie the FOV bug is perfect
[2023-01-09 20:22:59] <%AntiParagon> Yeah, harder to detect walls when they don't use autoaim.
[2023-01-09 20:22:59] <%+MunkE8> get rid of the red circle and its s tier
[2023-01-09 20:23:00] <+k0by_> its a 4x
[2023-01-09 20:23:01] <+bruhtred> is the aug any good?
[2023-01-09 20:23:03] <@%+cubezgg> there are absolutely cheaters that only use walls and don't use aimbot lol

[2023-01-09 20:23:15] <%RyseUpGaming> the fact that he dropped his bag when no one was moving and then talked to sac when he was behind the door, and then ran up the stairs and looked right at klean makes that kid a possible HACKER
[2023-01-09 20:23:26] <@%SpottedTango> the aug is comfortably a middle of the road gun
[2023-01-09 20:23:33] <eolanp> Agree

[2023-01-09 20:30:01] <%ekozaur> @barcode_i if it's like Apex, where there's a defined rank that dictates who plays against who, fine. But having a level 1 vs a level 40 in Tarkov? Especially when you can't even tell where you died from? What am I learning from that interaction?

[2023-01-09 20:37:22] <@%+cubezgg> or play your scav
[2023-01-09 20:37:32] <enferblaze> @The1SlyFox customs and shoreline and constantly die within 20sec of spawning, how is this good game play?

[2023-01-09 20:38:00] <%+Ergotic33> if they made early raidtime for scav on every map like in streets or lighthouse, we hade way more PVP in scavs vs pmc
[2023-01-09 20:38:07] <enferblaze> then ill watch these streamers and no one is around them when they spawn
[2023-01-09 20:38:07] <%The1SlyFox> @enferblaze don't play customs imho, play as scav to learn the maps or offline
[2023-01-09 20:38:09] <@%+cubezgg> its a ceramic lvl 6 bank robber

[2023-01-09 20:38:57] <+Daytona5051> are glasses still buggy?
[2023-01-09 20:38:59] <@%+cubezgg> @enferblaze 20 seconds sounds absolutely exaggerated, if you're dying right off of spawn you're likely running in the open or you're unaware of the other player spawns
[2023-01-09 20:39:00] <enferblaze> @The1SlyFox i dont understand how knowing the map better is gonna save me from dying in my spawn within 20secs
[2023-01-09 20:39:00] <%+countryttv> glad im not the only ADAR enjoyer, such a sick gun
[2023-01-09 20:39:04] <%ekozaur> @Klean will there be a time where Tarkov will have a system where the contents of your rig get ruined if you take damage? Or the backpack, like in DayZ?

[2023-01-09 20:39:20] <1killersquirrel> now that redut is basically useless, it's heave and gives as much protection as other armor at that level

[2023-01-09 20:39:41] <enferblaze> ill spawn, wait 10-15secs then move and then get rushed by some over lvl juiced up player

[2023-01-09 20:39:43] <%zielis_the_noodle> Got my found in raid ledx last night on scav run.
[2023-01-09 20:39:48] <Chris114> @Klean wait so bad players like me could finally kill
[2023-01-09 20:39:52] <+teesk1> @ekozaur I feel like that system doesn't fit well in tarkov, I think that's a little too much. Probably won't happen if we're lucky.
[2023-01-09 20:39:55] <%The1SlyFox> @enferblaze you learn the rotations, at least that has helped me
[2023-01-09 20:39:58] <GrandpaClamps> @enferblaze I'm new too. I feel you. Offline does help though. It takes a lot of time.
[2023-01-09 20:40:00] <MsYakumo> RIP sells are gonna be pretty nutty when that comes I think since I bet a lot of people are probably gonna be rocking light or little armor.

[2023-01-09 20:40:55] <%ekozaur> @teesk1 I was asking because adding something like the kevlar vest and the plate work independent in your rig, that's already very granular

[2023-01-09 20:52:38] <Arrowflingin> @cubezgg, i do remember them saying that now certain chains will unlock after a time limit.  Thank you!

[2023-01-09 21:07:38] <InnererKonflikt> @maiex thats fine, theres nothing wrong with your sticks, if its just usage, it is just as i said, memory leak, thats depending on game. if you check windows task manager how much does the game itself use?
[2023-01-09 21:07:42] <twizzymatt> your a high lvl so it doesnt affect you

[2023-01-09 21:09:19] <+maiex> @InnererKonflikt it usually uses 13-16gb even when the game has been opened for the first time, so theres another 10 ish gb being used and im not sure by what, cuz if i estimate ram usage by everything else it seems to not be more than 2-3gb.. so idk if windows is eating a bunch up and isnt showing in task manager

[2023-01-09 21:10:38] <InnererKonflikt> @maiex if the game eats 15 to 16 thats normal, it even eats up to 20 gb on some with steeets, usually windows even with severalchrome tabs eats 4 for os plus 4 for chrome (6 tabs+), it seems its windows with you.

[2023-01-09 21:22:21] <+Js_305> @Klean do you think a recoil change would benefit even more now that there would be less BP lasers

[2023-01-09 21:22:39] <dustodagreat> well said @Klean
[2023-01-09 21:22:40] <arogani> well put, I'm excited to see how this wipe plays out
[2023-01-09 21:22:50] <InnererKonflikt> @maiex committed ram vs actual usage is one thing, if your ram is so full without any programs, thats definitely not normal, even if its not a leak. usually ihad that with a leak. im not it support afterall. as i said, google it, theres something to it, it shouldnt happen
[2023-01-09 21:22:54] <Merc_The_Jerk> its going to keep more casual players around too. one complaint is the chads complain they dont have people to shit on mid/late wipe... well this change will hopefully keep more casuals around for them to dunk on
[2023-01-09 21:23:02] <+CrucialSW> I'm honestly pro remove flea too, more loot based gameplay, less advantage for levelled player cus the good loot is in raid for all to find.

[2023-01-09 21:23:14] <@%+cubezgg> @nonstopsiren13 yes and no, you can farm bosses/raiders/rogues for better ammo but there's no guarantee they spawn or they have what you're looking for; however, you can craft the meta ammo still

[2023-01-09 21:24:16] <arogani> @Klean do you feel like cheaters will be more of a problem with high tier ammo being less easily accessible? with them being able to see gear and all

[2023-01-09 21:26:36] <+statesticlyinaccurate> bro that prison wallet is a major selling point of why people get the EOD version right behind stash size
[2023-01-09 21:26:36] <BeerAndTheMan> we all love to eat ammo
[2023-01-09 21:26:36] <+ADStrike> wish that was like you can buy tier 1 and tier 2 ammo and everything else better than than only find in raid , would help alot I think
[2023-01-09 21:26:40] <+samthebravefps> people pay for EOD mate, wont happen
[2023-01-09 21:26:43] <alencarmb> shotgun meta incoming
[2023-01-09 21:26:44] <+woodstockwilly> @darthbosco_19 tonight 8 pm cst
[2023-01-09 21:26:45] <+BadManBenny> I agree. I feel like the only thing that goes in you container is what you brought into raid
[2023-01-09 21:26:45] <FrestyleWyvern> we need a spesific single slot asshole container, just for the memes
[2023-01-09 21:26:46] <+booskie03> Nothing should able to be placed in secure container after loading into raid
[2023-01-09 21:26:46] <gorillawarmace> great way to put it
[2023-01-09 21:26:47] <itsme_TLD> we did it boys! Meta ammo is no more NODDERS Clap
[2023-01-09 21:26:51] <%Howkin_> @Klean How do armor plate compatibility work with carriers IRL? are there like limits or such, Size weight etc? wonder how it will work in Tarkov
[2023-01-09 21:26:52] <Tanesiella> @Klean what boba tea is that
[2023-01-09 21:26:53] <%+longtimetoast> Do you think you will see a lot more flesh damage ammo being used with these changes?
[2023-01-09 21:26:54] <+glassics> nikita is gonna make these changes right now to double up everyone saying @Klean REEEEEEEE LUL
[2023-01-09 21:26:54] <InnererKonflikt> @cubezgg the obvious things usually are the ones that cause it. i run my OS super clean. but some use third party programs which commit but never free that ramspace even when closing. ram is a biaaatch T_T
[2023-01-09 21:26:55] <DonGromus> My ass my choice
[2023-01-09 21:26:56] <NuclearCarmah> secure container should be limited to maybe ammo, keys, keycards, and info items, etc..

[2023-01-09 21:26:57] <+irnhot> Didn‚Äôt say it had to happen with wipe. But with wipe just having had happened I can understand why people are upset. Fuck it I say take away flea
[2023-01-09 21:26:59] <GoodPsybrations> how  about this, you can't put FIR  items in secure container

[2023-01-09 21:27:02] <BeerAndTheMan> whats the proper way to chew tea?
[2023-01-09 21:27:05] <tindyerso> Just got into my first Shoreline raid of the wipe to do fishing gear, and the game decides to kick me out, twice. I think Nikita is trying to tell me something
[2023-01-09 21:27:08] <+MOGOXX> @Klean u beatin these karens again?
[2023-01-09 21:27:08] <%WhosAchilles> I survived all last wipe without ever buying bp and always had 1000+ raiders on labs always have bp
[2023-01-09 21:27:08] <%+darthbosco_19> @woodstockwilly nice! thanks
[2023-01-09 21:27:11] <BingBongMcgee> don't tell nikkita about my 366 AP pls
[2023-01-09 21:27:16] <%mcdunkin> i recently bought EoD because i was spending so much time managing my stash and wish they would just flatten a lot of the bonuses the advantage you get is insane
[2023-01-09 21:27:18] <+DaGrayman> So many people think every change hurts average players and helps the top %. They don't realize that no matter what change they make, top % will always have good stuff. It's just harder now
[2023-01-09 21:27:18] <+BadManBenny> also I would like to see all meta ammo only found in raid
[2023-01-09 21:27:21] <@%+cubezgg> @NuclearCarmah secure container should be limited to not being allowed to put things inside of it in raid
[2023-01-09 21:27:28] <babe_harris> ban scavs from the game and implement the free loadout
[2023-01-09 21:27:33] <+CrucialSW> Tarkov is known for its sounds and detailed animations. Putting item in ass soundfx and animation when.

[2023-01-09 21:27:43] <babe_harris> scav is a weird concept
[2023-01-09 21:27:47] <GoodPsybrations> @cubezgg agreed
[2023-01-09 21:27:50] <PraeAster0th> @cubezgg yeah agreed, or it should take a long time to open & put items in

[2023-01-09 22:02:52] <%KrackinWise313> @BingBongMcgee yeah a ghille or some really good camo would be dope imo

[2023-01-09 22:08:05] <TerminatorNLD> @SilverEdg3 You've got to be trolling at this point LUL
[2023-01-09 22:08:07] <GrandpaClamps> @SilverEdg3 "Escape" from Tarkov isn't about surviving.... or looting?
[2023-01-09 22:08:10] <@%+Sev07Sniper> @SilverEdg3 Think you're thinking of arena lmao
[2023-01-09 22:08:10] <SensualCharmm> Hello
[2023-01-09 22:08:16] <%MrGreyv> It's okay for a game you spent money to just maybe not be for you
[2023-01-09 22:08:22] <CEOofDripHam00d> @SilverEdg3 another person who thinks tarkov is just pvp, wait for arena and then you can say this
[2023-01-09 22:08:40] <%MrGreyv> But don't try to drag everybody else down just because you're salty
[2023-01-09 22:09:11] <+venoxx34> @SilverEdg3 u should try cod and stop playing eft
[2023-01-09 22:09:14] <SilverEdg3> @CEOofDripHam00d Nah ive played for 6 wipes now its def a pvp game cant really tell me otherwise

[2023-01-09 22:09:27] <@%+AMuller> @SilverEdg3 as long as no one is cheating they can literally focus on what they want, let people do their own thing and do your own thing yourself mstvRec

[2023-01-09 22:09:36] <@%+cubezgg> the game is absolutely not just a pvp game
[2023-01-09 22:09:40] <+ChaceFX> stop feeding the troll

[2023-01-09 22:19:46] <CEOofDripHam00d> @RyseUpGaming I think we will eventually get snow maps as a christmass event. They will make static snowy versions of maps. If they make dynamic weather that would be unbelievable.

[2023-01-09 22:20:27] <GuvNaylor> @CEOofDripHam00d  we are getting a snow weather system for EOD / dlc im pretty sure
[2023-01-09 22:20:27] <+baamang> Is the both the comtacs 4 and normal comtacs?
[2023-01-09 22:20:30] <+catlikecadaver> @TacticalxZebra Well, 556A1 is available early from peacekeeper level 2 for pretty cheap. BT is 30 round pack for a pretty expensive trade.
[2023-01-09 22:20:40] <+papadunph> do all the headsets work similar or are comtacs the best?
[2023-01-09 22:20:41] <@%+AMuller> @CEOofDripHam00d once upon a time snow DLC was mentioned to come with the EOD edition. But I've got no idea if this has changed, I haven't played tark since late 2019

[2023-01-09 22:49:02] <+THEFLAKEsenpai> That‚Äôs why I took a break from the game is because I could tell I wasn‚Äôt having fun with the game.  So I started watching you, tweak, and swamp fox and I‚Äôve not had a single frustrating game even though I‚Äôve died to cheaters and lost a lot of good loot.
[2023-01-09 22:49:12] <+FatherOwens> honestly that guy was a good player
[2023-01-09 22:49:13] <JonesReaper00> high chance that its actually a cheater but if they are not hats off to that guy

[2023-01-09 22:49:35] <Keulenkonrad___> u were all in the open, and its easy for ap-20 slugs to hunt all down. maybe there a good players outside, maybe a cheater.. who knows

[2023-01-09 22:50:45] <+VladuFTW> i was so excited for this wipe but seems in the end i decided to say stop to this garbage situation... the new map unplayable and second, flying cheaters are so often like its something normal...

[2023-01-09 22:51:21] <+awzt1n> @blzdkrusadr Many cheaters are selling the accounts too so there's that motivation too. Lame either way
[2023-01-09 22:51:25] <JonesReaper00> really hard to get rid of these cheaters because hackers will always figure out a way to get around anticheats since theres a big market in sold Hacks
[2023-01-09 22:51:27] <%+Bl4ck_B1rd_> @cuddlyyy Can't buy good ammo from traders until rep lvl 4
[2023-01-09 22:51:29] <+jasp3rs> That explains that guy doing the ballsy dumb push. Cheater was probably his carry so he didn't have to worry about losing gear.

[2023-01-09 23:05:05] <%+GWoo42> @TTVBillyTheKid like the NVIDIA geforce settings, sometimes it will do auto presets for game settings and if your pc is good enough it will upscale your game to 4k and then downscale it to your monitors resolution
[2023-01-09 23:05:05] <+awzt1n> @awzt1n that's good. I figured but I wasn't sure

[2023-01-09 23:16:31] <jaxjr1995> this battle bit is dope AF i hope it becomes and stays popular
[2023-01-09 23:16:41] <%TSvassilev> I feel that with the FOV fix I mess up my point fire

[2023-01-09 23:17:31] <+TheMapleKitKat> CoD is hella outdated nothing has changed really since cod started LUL
[2023-01-09 23:17:34] <%Swerve556> and bullets shoot out of the top of your head
[2023-01-09 23:17:37] <DoctorLiquid> What about Rainbow six siege?
[2023-01-09 23:17:39] <GrandpaClamps> @TSvassilev bullets do come out of the tip of the gun, directionally influenced, so if you don't line it up proper it will shoot off at an angle, unfortunately.
[2023-01-09 23:17:49] <Cudaaaaaaa> early cod campaigns are where its at NODDERS
[2023-01-09 23:17:52] <HuskiestNinja> Halo Jumping and dropshotting are the bane of my existence in cod. its awful! jumping and dropping should affect your accuracy and they dont in cod
[2023-01-09 23:17:52] <+tikka___> Does Tarkov not have sporadic bullet impact every now and then or no?
[2023-01-09 23:17:55] <%Freckles619> does Tarkov have smoke bombs?

[2023-01-09 23:18:16] <%+stonecoldsteveheadeyes> i feel like the new warzone can be played a little slower and still be successful compared to previous cods

[2023-01-09 23:33:50] <%Jeezy_Snowman> ^^ Yep
[2023-01-09 23:33:54] <+Fuzam88> The change is good for the game however i dont see why this wasnt a change on wipe vs 10 days into wipe
[2023-01-09 23:33:57] <+Bluzrd> so me farming max traders and grenadier isnt enough farming to buy 120 bp every reset?
[2023-01-09 23:34:06] <OutlawGGs> can you still craft bp at workbench lvl 3?
[2023-01-09 23:34:08] <%Jeezy_Snowman> you will appreciate being killed by good ammo, they didn't just get it from trader reset

[2023-01-09 23:34:28] <%+N3ON_LEMON> @Bluzrd it's almost like you have no idea what this game is supposed to be when it's finished.
[2023-01-09 23:34:32] <DexLT> Best example I remember is DayZ, old engine was same story as tarkov, not optimised, after swithc, look at that game :)

[2023-01-09 23:35:38] <de_charny> have they correspondingly increased the loose spawns and quantity of 5.56 relative to 5.45? It doesnt make sense that you only find loose 5.56 and not boxes of ammo

[2023-01-09 23:51:05] <%+BarelyABearr> I thought you did have to name it?
[2023-01-09 23:51:07] <@%SpottedTango> connection rejected
[2023-01-09 23:51:13] <%AntiParagon> If you clip something, the channel owner can recommend a name.
[2023-01-09 23:51:14] <@%SpottedTango> you lucked out kid Kapp
[2023-01-09 23:51:16] <%AntiParagon> That would be good.
[2023-01-09 23:51:23] <+WaxyBHO> it auto fills title with whatever stream title is

[2023-01-09 23:51:39] <hubalek> !fov
[2023-01-09 23:51:39] <Narthuk> so one thing people may not know is that when you click to clip it saves the clip whether you publish it or not with the stream title as default
[2023-01-09 23:51:41] <+trublack> Original
[2023-01-09 23:51:41] <%AntiParagon> I wonder if I have old Klean clips.

[2023-01-09 23:55:46] <+awzt1n> @KrackinWise313 Would be awesome if they gave them an edge as far as it takes a little longer to heal from a shot. Like they have to pull the bolt out first to stop the bleed. IDK
[2023-01-09 23:56:13] <divino36912> I think the skill system should be taking out completely . And keep stims

[2023-01-09 23:59:11] <%+moosE3knucklE> like i understand this game really wasnt designed for the "casual" gamer but at the same time u push away alot of ppl that enjoy the game tryin to just make casual tarkov just impossible lol
[2023-01-09 23:59:15] <BingBongMcgee> he said capes ,like ruenscape
[2023-01-09 23:59:17] <+xzmouse> there should be weapon type bonuses for faction as well in my opinion @Klean
