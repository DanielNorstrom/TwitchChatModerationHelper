[2023-01-05 09:06:19] <TTVflyyi> @Elosanta yo idk if you know but theres a trick on karthus you sell all your items and buy max ability haste before you ult then you undo it before the ult pops to save you half the cooldown. if you buy axiom 4th or 5th item ontop of that you can ult twice

[2023-01-05 09:07:28] <TTVflyyi> @Elosanta yo idk if you know but theres a trick on karthus you sell all your items and buy max ability haste before you ult then you undo it before the ult pops to save you half the cooldown. if you buy axiom 4th or 5th item ontop of that you can ult twice consecutively
[2023-01-05 09:07:28] <mingeeatingdisorder> @Venice_1 i think its just look easy laning against soraka if youre pyke but mid to late game, its hard to execute someone with soraka by their side

[2023-01-05 09:32:16] <xsurus> it's been known for some time
[2023-01-05 09:32:19] <Baltamutus> Shen did it since his ult scaled better with ap, but i never knew it worked with karthus ult too
[2023-01-05 09:32:22] <+leomxxn> this has always been possible
[2023-01-05 09:32:22] <nobody11311496> @Elosanta pretty sure refund doesnt work after you use a spell in normal game

[2023-01-05 09:32:38] <+SkywalkerCush> you dont because you get the shield from ap
[2023-01-05 09:32:38] <user9750> what if u refund slow and keep the items KEKW
[2023-01-05 09:32:39] <+OBrien2204> I remember pro's buying alternators after they died in order for burn damage to proc it's passive after their death. Seems kind of similar to that
[2023-01-05 09:32:41] <%mtownhustler0433> @nobody11311496 only after the damage is done

[2023-01-05 09:33:35] <%+kadaxx> u can do this only endgame and when u ult with karthus ult you dont need to ult again in 1 minute no ?
[2023-01-05 09:33:36] <+VoxN0va> if you sell umbral and keep liandry as mythic yo uprobably have even more cd
[2023-01-05 09:33:37] <tempname22> @elosanta buy duskblade to get more CD passive from mythic
[2023-01-05 09:33:40] <%Aedh_Wished> i wonder if it works with jinx/ashe/ez ults
[2023-01-05 09:33:40] <fluezlv> smart
[2023-01-05 09:33:43] <+mr_watermelon84> u have lower CD and with axiom arc passive u have 20% CD of R from KILL MAN :O

[2023-01-05 09:33:51] <RTX_Lynch> @Elosanta Yes its like cast a spell before level up for the cd and mana but you get dmg of lvl 2 Q
[2023-01-05 09:33:51] <SirCaff> if you level mid ult does it increase the dmg? Elosanta
[2023-01-05 09:33:51] <Baltamutus> Imagine getting hit in base while refunding, that would be so cancer no?

[2023-01-05 09:47:11] <HybridElephant> You're kinda right and kinda wrong, odds are created and changed based on current situations, that's why odds are just random numbers in these "T1 games" what the fuck would you base it on originally. There is nothing you can base it on.
[2023-01-05 09:47:11] <d0_g0> so wintrading only works on a very small scale ?

[2023-01-05 09:50:05] <%Spakeshear> I am a elosanta hate watcher. Every day I wait in his offline chat for hours waiting for him to go live. I have never missed typing "-1" when he misses CS. I have never missed typing "KEKW" when he dies. When he starts stream I always point out how bald and short he is. I have 15 alt accounts on separate tabs at the ready at all times. This man is my anathema. This man is my purpose. This man is my life.
