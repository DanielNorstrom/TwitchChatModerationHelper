[2022-12-21 15:40:27] <+bilzebuth> Is last boss killable rn?
[2022-12-21 15:40:29] <jeremyjcole2> That was really fast
[2022-12-21 15:40:33] <jeremyjcole2> 😂
[2022-12-21 15:40:48] <%+theLoohs> Are we done with the splits boys?
[2022-12-21 15:40:52] <+SLJDHL_> @bilzebuth no they have a few bosses they need to kill first
[2022-12-21 15:40:58] <+Crazyjuniot> I haven’t been able to keep up with the race. Is there a reason why the teams haven’t progressed much in the last day?
[2022-12-21 15:41:04] <%Mekftw> @theLoohs  yh
[2022-12-21 15:41:10] <greenziaax> @Crazyjuniot lack gear
[2022-12-21 15:41:18] <jeremyjcole2> They need a few ilvls
[2022-12-21 15:41:21] <%ayomus> @Crazyjuniot they need to kill an add while the boss hp doesnt move
[2022-12-21 15:41:21] <antonio43> this is hc?
[2022-12-21 15:41:24] <jeremyjcole2> Overall
[2022-12-21 15:41:25] <+Facers> want to see nnoggie play in progress <3
[2022-12-21 15:41:26] <grixtwtch> @bilzebuth blizz nerfed hp of adds? maybe it is
[2022-12-21 15:41:30] <+chipsychips> @Crazyjuniot last boss seems hard, also the race started with alle content open, so they just pulled mythic boss 1 on friday or saturday (did splits before)

What if we didn't let Liquid get ever so closer to waking up before we even Mythic reclear? For every minute this group are enjoying their dinner, or taking a comfort break to go to the toilet, Liquid are 1 minute closer to logging in, and closer to winning this race. Lets get it together now and show them pesky Americans #TeamEcho
