[2022-12-29 12:02:12] <Maunsta> does anyone know how the matchups work?  when i read about it, i think it would be hikaru v anish and magnus v duda, with yu v denis.

[2022-12-29 12:04:14] <Maunsta> i think in these swiss things, it would be 1 v 4, 2v5, and 3v6, weird as that is.  so that would be hikaru v anish.  but what do i know, i only read about it last night. im about 10-1 to be wrong lol

[2022-12-29 12:26:15] <%klutch_easilyy> @darthrevan666 he forced a draw with white, proves he felt nervous about playing Hikaru. my point was Giri is far worse at blitz than he is at classical and rapid, hints how he got first rounded in scc. DOn't be silly
