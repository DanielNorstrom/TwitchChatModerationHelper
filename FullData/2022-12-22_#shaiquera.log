[2022-12-22 12:58:31] <TheCyberchill> kassanda is uh, you'll learn of her origins, there is a sidequest in this dlc where there is a argonian with a developmental disorder, and some folks dislike it, but they have the npc "stim" to calm themselves down, they're quite an accurate treatment for someone with that kinda disorder.
[2022-12-22 12:58:53] <TheCyberchill> the sidequest seems to be an an area you've been.

[2022-12-22 13:41:39] <TheCyberchill> oh wait
[2022-12-22 13:41:46] <TheCyberchill> this zone has a unique staff btw
[2022-12-22 13:41:59] <TheCyberchill> it has no other visual twin in game nor can you unlock it's style motief
[2022-12-22 13:42:06] VIEWERS: 53
[2022-12-22 13:42:19] <TheCyberchill> so i put the staff into the storage chest rather then decon it
[2022-12-22 13:44:06] VIEWERS: 53
[2022-12-22 13:44:40] <TheCyberchill> make sure to lock it
[2022-12-22 13:44:41] <%grumpy_ol_bugga> just went afk to get a drink what i miss
[2022-12-22 13:44:46] <TheCyberchill> so you dont accidentally decon it
[2022-12-22 13:45:28] <TheCyberchill> as you cant get it as a style page
[2022-12-22 13:45:33] <TheCyberchill> it should be a style page
[2022-12-22 13:45:47] <%grumpy_ol_bugga> yr not in sync with assassins creed with a leap of faith like that
[2022-12-22 13:45:48] <TheCyberchill> perhaps you can reassemble it with the newer system?
[2022-12-22 13:46:07] VIEWERS: 53
[2022-12-22 13:47:40] <TheCyberchill> I find it quite odd that eso has a tribe caleld NAGA and Lamia given that both names tend to be use dfor snake folk but instead the naga are... fish people

[2022-12-22 13:49:30] <TheCyberchill> Also Lamia seem to be sentient beastfolk, it's quite odd that we've not seen many villages, we've seen one village of them, and a few groups of them investing dungeons.

[2022-12-22 13:50:12] <TheCyberchill> They're more sentient then harpies, they speak imperial basic they have shown they can be somewhat civilized.
[2022-12-22 13:51:03] <TheCyberchill> no
[2022-12-22 13:51:12] <TheCyberchill> your mount is based on your general mount training ranks
[2022-12-22 13:51:13] <TheCyberchill> speaking of
[2022-12-22 13:51:17] <The1Fortress> all mounts are the same speed, depending on your characters riding speed
[2022-12-22 13:51:23] <TheCyberchill> we should do a battleground for your passive after this
[2022-12-22 13:51:49] <%grumpy_ol_bugga> im sure u used to be able to upgrade them
[2022-12-22 13:52:08] VIEWERS: 58
[2022-12-22 13:52:09] <The1Fortress> you can upgrade them by training your character grumpy
[2022-12-22 13:52:15] <TheCyberchill> makesure to top off your exp buff
[2022-12-22 13:52:21] <The1Fortress> can also unlock the pvp perk for a bonus 30% riding speed
[2022-12-22 13:53:22] <%grumpy_ol_bugga> @The1Fortress sometimes i get games confused with ech other , but i coulda sworn i put points in my mount back in the day to improve its speed ect
[2022-12-22 13:53:56] <TheCyberchill> they changed the the buff for riding speed
[2022-12-22 13:54:06] <TheCyberchill> they added a passive mount speed to continous attack
[2022-12-22 13:54:09] VIEWERS: 58
[2022-12-22 13:54:14] <TheCyberchill> it use to be part of riding manovers
[2022-12-22 13:54:20] <TheCyberchill> now riding manouvers is optional
[2022-12-22 13:54:41] <%grumpy_ol_bugga> also i thought some came with dif stats so they didnt all start or end up with the same speeds
[2022-12-22 13:55:30] <%grumpy_ol_bugga> had to upgrade at the stables if i recall right
[2022-12-22 13:55:37] <TheCyberchill> No your mounts are entirely visual apparently
[2022-12-22 13:55:49] <TheCyberchill> aside form the multirider mount or the joke april fools horse
[2022-12-22 13:55:57] <TheCyberchill> which is specially slower then all mounts on purpous

[2022-12-22 15:36:55] <TheCyberchill> I chose the Naga, as the way they both speak she has wisdom and strength, and unlike Xukas her people will manage without her, and all the values are not ouright evil
[2022-12-22 15:37:51] <TheCyberchill> so either choice i feel this isn't a morally "good/bad" option more like which quirky character do you personally feel would be best to be left to aid the world in life, and whos best to pay ferryman of the river stix
[2022-12-22 15:38:15] <TheCyberchill> play*

[2022-12-22 15:39:43] <TheCyberchill> if you accutally succeded in that your more likely to fall into a pit and die needing to respawn then reach your goal
