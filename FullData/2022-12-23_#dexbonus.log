[2022-12-23 17:54:10] <%$DarrellBiggums> I knew I recognized it!! My little sister is a theater kid and I’ve definitely heard her belting that song around the parents house
[2022-12-23 17:54:13] <MrsMusica> I was thinking about your earlier conversation about how Matillda has been a way to teach Clarke about how not all adults are good.  For my son, it was actually more of a way to show him what an actual bad teacher is like (Mrs Trunchbull) because sometimes he thinks his teachers are *so mean* because they want him to do work at school.
