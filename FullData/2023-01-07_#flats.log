[2023-01-07 01:04:39] <+biccthanana> For everyone asking why not just dive, in 5v5 with one tank, if you are constantly diving a Widow or other sniper without much backup, it leaves the rest of your team vulnerable
[2023-01-07 01:04:40] <Snowwolfboi> if u ask me

[2023-01-07 01:06:20] <%apooooop> one shot protection should exist in the game, solves the sniper issue and feels less punishing to play, and makes the snipers play like a team game instead of just fucking off and doing their own thing

[2023-01-07 01:15:23] <X3n0verse> @TheMrUnorthodox Yeah, I mean I'm not high ranked myself but I pride myself in at least KNOWING what's good to play. The games are boring, but we cant forget that since Orisa counters Hog, and Hog's getting nerfed, then who's gonna counter Orisa? Even a small but noticeable nerf should help spice up the meta, maybe JQ or Sigma meta LUL lohenvLove much luv too

[2023-01-07 01:29:14] <ChronoAura> If Rein is ever S tier, you know the game is in a bad state.
[2023-01-07 01:29:15] <%$OrdoSkirataIT> @binagin easy way to tell if it's comp or not is to look at the scores at the top, generally there'll be square boxes with numbers for comp and nothing (or circles) for qp

[2023-01-07 01:30:24] <+Techative> @drodify I get what you're saying, imo I didn't like the lower health for her cause I'm not good enough and I don't think she was as playable that way. everyone is kinda rude online.

[2023-01-07 01:30:52] <Kuligon> @Doctor_Rocky_Balboa he should have a shield dash like brig has, would make him so so so much more useful to play as
[2023-01-07 01:30:55] <Nexallus> I miss the rein/zarya comps in ow1
[2023-01-07 01:30:56] <%+A7XBulletSlayer> I was never a fan of Mei's kit, she plays more like a tank than a DPS

[2023-01-07 18:40:00] <%Eth213> oo nice nice
[2023-01-07 18:40:08] <%sofishdekat> NODDERS I'm gonna get a camera, maybe a gopro soon, looking forward to seeing that
[2023-01-07 18:44:34] <@%flyingfish1230> id say get a dslr if you can, over a gorp. gopros are only good for like underwater or action, in general the dslr will be wayyyyyyyyy better for photography

[2023-01-07 18:49:12] <%sofishdekat> I want both actually - the gopro I'm looking to mount in my backyard for video burst and possibly still frames. I've been looking at a sony a7000 kit (I think it's that one, ~$900 for the kit) for wandering-around photography
[2023-01-07 18:49:49] <%sofishdekat> the good thing about gopros is their image stabilization, both physical and software for action stuff
[2023-01-07 18:50:14] <@%flyingfish1230> yee ive got one of the cannon dslrs, it does great. but my brother has way nicer cameras than me, so i didnt bother bringing it. he just doesnt have a gopro, so i figured that would be fun
[2023-01-07 18:50:27] <%sofishdekat> nice!
[2023-01-07 18:50:38] <@%flyingfish1230> yeah i got one of the hero 11s, the image stabilazation is insane
[2023-01-07 18:51:07] <@%flyingfish1230> in the max mode it locks the horizon even if you spin the camera so you get level vid even if yuou flip it ver
[2023-01-07 18:51:10] <@%flyingfish1230> over*
[2023-01-07 18:51:27] <%sofishdekat> yeah, and with the right housing on it, it's super durable to a lot of extremes
[2023-01-07 18:51:33] <%sofishdekat> that's really cool
[2023-01-07 18:51:51] <@%flyingfish1230> yeah i got one of the full plastic ones even though its waterproof (to 35 feet) on its own
[2023-01-07 18:52:01] <@%flyingfish1230> that shit makes it indistructable
[2023-01-07 18:52:30] <@%flyingfish1230> you dont really need the housing for it to be durable, but i didnt want to risk scratching the lens
[2023-01-07 18:54:27] <%sofishdekat> interesting. From my reading on what I would want for it, the housing helps the temp and weatherproofing part of it. Will look into it more, thanks!
[2023-01-07 18:57:37] <@%flyingfish1230> the housing actually made mine overheat, but i imagine it would keep it warmer
[2023-01-07 18:57:50] <@%flyingfish1230> and yeah, weatherproofing for sure
[2023-01-07 19:02:10] <@%flyingfish1230> okay food time for realsies finally

[2023-01-07 21:14:00] <@%flyingfish1230> Cheer200 The dark side of modhood is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful... the only thing he was afraid of was stream sniping flats, which eventually, of course, he accidentally did. Unfortunately he queued into flats twice in one day, and flats banned him. Ironic. he could ban others but not protect himself.

Also communication is a big part of his play to help with knowing your "zone of influence". Knowing when to take space and give up space in order to protect your team is crucial too.

[2023-01-07 21:56:52] <%AceOverKILL> QP is just a good way to practice. I wouldn't worry too much about rank, if anything you want to face tougher opponents so when you join ranked you'll be more ramped up when facing against people closer to your skill level
[2023-01-07 21:56:53] <%OrdoSkirataIT> I'm reasonably sure that the reason QP feels so sweaty now is because you can stack up easier in it so the coordination just spikes and makes the games more sweaty
[2023-01-07 21:56:53] <%Conker5720> my favorite part is that qp has the attitude of comp

[2023-01-07 22:05:06] <%AceOverKILL> @omex_rl yeah I'd say playing close to chokes\permanent objects is the way to go until you can take space.  Since you're a tank who's leading a lot of fights, it's important to ping enemies you see and communicate your actions especially with your healers
[2023-01-07 22:05:14] <%$TeaHauss> @cheonsaofwar there are usually no repeats

[2023-01-07 22:12:57] <!%Somnus> Cheer200 Guys! I really fucking LOVE Sojourn and Hog every game, it's really cool to play respawn simulator as we have this many oneshot heroes! ^_^ I love peaking to get hooked around 5 dimensions to get oneshot or when she says "THIS ENDS NOOOOOW" and Mercy has her staff up her ass and we just drop like flies! Honestly, it's cool. LOL I LOVE SOJOURN!

[2023-01-07 22:34:03] <rt_lancaster> i am so curious to see what they actually do to change hog, like if they do something to try and fix his playstyle or they just make him a throw pick again
[2023-01-07 22:34:18] <AureliusGold> I'm curious too 👀

[2023-01-07 22:34:45] <%$jasonwocky> i'm still of the opinion that none of these reworks really matter till Sojourn is brought in line
[2023-01-07 22:34:53] <%IrZKuma> @rt_lancaster id like to be wrong, but id bet that they will nerf him to the ground

[2023-01-07 22:35:55] <%IrZKuma> @rt_lancaster it is, but thats still going to be a nerf to him overall most likely due to his current dominance

[2023-01-07 22:37:00] <%a_witcher> one shots on whatever character are a no go .. hog soj widow .. they all need to be looked at
[2023-01-07 22:37:01] <Rob_501> @unheardscroll no
[2023-01-07 22:37:05] <%ju1cycats> yeah it's trash lol
[2023-01-07 22:37:06] <theoriginalboopa> Kiriko seems to pair nice
[2023-01-07 22:37:06] <rt_lancaster> hog shouldn't be a one shot, but they need to change him so he can do something other than one shot

[2023-01-07 22:37:25] <marsu5000_> @a_witcher Widow doesent have a problem my guy
[2023-01-07 22:37:29] <Umbra_Skull> hook willl still be really good if they remove his 1 shot combo, the kill just won't be as free as it is rn
[2023-01-07 22:37:32] <+flatswannabe> I liked Flats idea of making him be able to turn 360
[2023-01-07 22:37:33] <unheardscroll> hi @a_witcher
[2023-01-07 22:37:35] <rt_lancaster> @a_witcher removing widow one shot is a little iffy
[2023-01-07 22:37:44] <0oooaquaooo0> best hog change imo is dmg slightly lowered, hook cd increase, incoming healing decrease (that applys to healers and self heal)

[2023-01-07 23:46:05] <@%^StreamElements> When Flats was in high school he joined the football team. Within his first week there, someone else on the team ended up crossing a line and pissing Flats off. Flats flattened the kid with his 6ft body, thus earning him the nickname "Flats" since "Flatten" sounds stupid.
