[2022-12-24 16:03:30] <Tugsby> zergling
[2022-12-24 16:03:40] <%iLLeSTeBaNos> I just think with billions in particular until u get to the point where things are random, is just taking advantage of the timings to greed as hard as possible
[2022-12-24 16:03:56] <%iLLeSTeBaNos> so it's a ton of having to remember each map
[2022-12-24 16:04:12] <%iLLeSTeBaNos> which is quite a grind
[2022-12-24 16:04:12] <%헤일로푸딩 (heraclitus35)> i think zerg is weaker then SC1
[2022-12-24 16:04:26] <@%MeatyHook> I think you jumped into really hard mode in billions, like people LOVE using pause, you didnt even bother with it, true gamer meatysWICKED
