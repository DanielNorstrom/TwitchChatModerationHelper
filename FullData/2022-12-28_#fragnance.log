[2022-12-28 19:38:34] <flawlesslykun> @Kiyoix for real tho, i think they should just go away with seasonal affixes. I would much rather see development time and resources go to building and designing new dungeons more often

[2022-12-28 20:11:39] <%Jhazy> I tried playing without felblade and I feel fury starved in comparison, and the extra mobility just is so nice when fel rushing through mobs to get back to them etc. Is the immo thing really that much better? or just a preference thing
[2022-12-28 20:11:42] <%Jhazy> @Fragnance

[2022-12-28 23:05:39] <flawlesslykun> but i think any havoc dh build is simply blasting in m+ tbh
[2022-12-28 23:05:47] <flawlesslykun> throw glaive is fun to play tho
[2022-12-28 23:06:19] <+TygarusAlex> is it optimal atm? I see a lot of glaive tempest but I prefer throw glaive
[2022-12-28 23:06:30] VIEWERS: 639
[2022-12-28 23:07:38] <flawlesslykun> depends how good you are at the game tbh. i think if they don't nerf havoc more, it probably is bis. But if your doing like huge pulls, double eye beam is also super good
