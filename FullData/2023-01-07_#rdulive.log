[2023-01-07 06:30:36] <%no_more_memes> kripp
[2023-01-07 06:30:36] <@^StreamElements> HmmmG Kripp is only 7k mmr but he is far ahead of Rdu in critical thinking and analyzing the playing field, Kripp is always 5 steps ahead and is allready considering what minions to buy in tavern tier 6 while only at turn 2. wheras Rdu is only looking at the battlefield in front of him. i firmly believe Rdu should leave his bg carreer and focus on his cooking.

[2023-01-07 13:55:21] <snejpen> At around 7k you gain 100 for first and lose 100 for 8th, anything higher than that the rating gain slowly goes down and losses Get bigger, so at a point 4th doesnt give points anymore

[2023-01-07 13:58:31] <snejpen> The point system is good for the high end because there are not that many people and you can play people with people way lower rank than you, i played RDU when i was 9k and he was 14k, with a regular mmr system instead of point a loss would have been devastating for him if he lost

[2023-01-07 14:14:31] <silentpeace95> @babyybaer I queued with JJ several times at 9k, so pretty much anything above 8k can get queued up together

[2023-01-07 14:39:02] <%+Shorteracesobad> The main thing to know about MMR in BGs, is the average MMR of the lobby determines how much MMR you will get. If u are in a lobby with an average MMR lower than your own MMR, 4th might lose u some points (or win few points). If you are in a lobby withe an average MMR higher than your own MMR, 4th place might grant you extra points than expected. 4th place is just an exemple i chosed

[2023-01-07 15:44:35] <@%R2DU> HmmmG Kripp is only 7k mmr but he is far ahead of Rdu in critical thinking and analyzing the playing field, Kripp is always 5 steps ahead and is allready considering what minions to buy in tavern tier 6 while only at turn 2. wheras Rdu is only looking at the battlefield in front of him. i firmly believe Rdu should leave his bg carreer and focus on his cooking.

[2023-01-07 16:54:14] <@%R2DU> LEEROY Leeroy Jenkins created a strategy that revolved around trying to defeat your opponent in one turn without requiring any cards on the board. Fighting for board control and battles between minions make an overall game of Hearthstone more fun and compelling, but taking 20+ damage in one turn is not particularly fun or interactive. LEEROY
