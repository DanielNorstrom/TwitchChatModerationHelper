[2022-12-31 09:11:43] <%Criptonix100> I bet in January ANet will buff Firebrand just in time for Mike Madge
[2022-12-31 09:11:59] <%Zeroslayer> Madge They won't

[2022-12-31 09:13:41] <%Zeroslayer> @criptonix100 Madge I was playing the EoD spec primarily before the firebrand nerf anyways.

[2022-12-31 09:15:17] <%Criptonix100> for me on lutris it works well if you just go back and forth from fshack 7.2 to the new version of Wine-GE

[2022-12-31 09:45:54] <%Dragonnan> Preach and/or chat, somebody told me yesterday that "random favorite mount" functions like the macro people been using, that it only mounts you on dragonriding mounts where they can be used, or only on flying mounts in old zones, etc. Is it true?

[2022-12-31 09:47:27] <%Dragonnan> @Dragonnan Well.... Fuck me sideways then. Since when? I remember it using your whole favourite pool before Dragonflight came. On a different note: Why do peeps use the macro then? Is it because it's unreliable, like @ChunkeyNinja just said?

[2022-12-31 11:08:39] <%+StarShopping95> Win more than you lose but also trade 3 wins with your friend monkaHmm
[2022-12-31 11:09:11] <TheBiscuitNZ> @Cara1977 actual serious haha, almost drama time wothy though i just said ok and left..may be invited back next week if i get gear
[2022-12-31 11:09:16] <%ravenribb> DaltinSW Kheonik so you're saying that Mike can get that strong in that zone with guy 1 shotting him almost as soon Mike resses. ok
[2022-12-31 11:09:36] <%ravenribb> swap on priest pretty strong
[2022-12-31 11:09:43] <%unholyhoit> @StarShopping95 you do get rating at 3 3, then when you stop getting rating at 3 3 you go 4 2 and alternate, this is easy as  a healer
[2022-12-31 11:09:47] <+DaltinSW> You can very, very quickly assemble a full set of powers with the orbs that stay on the ground

[2022-12-31 13:08:59] <SEVENTHOUSANDPOTATOES> Its either heal the party/tank more, or do more than just spam 2 buttons as dps

[2022-12-31 13:09:14] <Funderik> what's the point of a healer if there's nothing to heal tho
[2022-12-31 13:09:15] <+The_Stormblades7> when you get a shit party healing can get real spicy
[2022-12-31 13:09:17] <%EeraGames> I find FF healing so nice tbh. I've been doing Sage main this expansion for Savage, it's been a good time
[2022-12-31 13:09:19] <Kichiro22> Its a minority of healers, very much the hardcore players
[2022-12-31 13:09:21] <+jay_kitsune> well you either spam the tank or spam your 1 dpd button, i think they went off track with healers inffxiv.  healers need more to do imo
[2022-12-31 13:09:22] <darkfrossst> true
[2022-12-31 13:09:29] <%Dragonnan> @thedevilsjester For best tabtargeting combat, WoW. For possibly the best story(telling), FF14. Sorry, I'm not Preach, but I'm trying to help aswell.

[2022-12-31 13:09:38] <$toaladelta> a lot of healers in FF also want to be healing more, because healing gameplay at higher difficulties devolve to "how much can you press 1 without wiping"

[2022-12-31 13:10:30] <HypnoHorror> GW2 is way more interesting to play
[2022-12-31 13:10:32] <%spejspag> Do you plan to go through story?
[2022-12-31 13:10:34] <%+kalathim> GW2 is a lot of fun but very different

[2022-12-31 13:10:58] <Radium_Lavans> GW2 is not that interesting to play.
[2022-12-31 13:11:06] <%Dragonnan> @Preachlfw A cutie named @thedevilsjester is curious of your MMO recommendations, sir, if you would.
[2022-12-31 13:11:08] <Cife_ra> gw2 is fun but if you're into raiding gw2 just doesn't have too much content
[2022-12-31 13:11:10] <%spejspag> Do you plan to go through GW2 story? Or just endgame?
[2022-12-31 13:11:10] <%+Armst> Destiny 2 Raids is good shit
[2022-12-31 13:11:11] <%+Bashiel> GW2 was even more different at the start
[2022-12-31 13:11:12] <Dreion> Really love the open world stuff in GW2
[2022-12-31 13:11:14] <%+kalathim> @Preachlfw You gonna try runescape too? Kappa
[2022-12-31 13:11:18] <Radium_Lavans> gw1 is more nice to play
[2022-12-31 13:11:20] <%XRay2x> gw2 never had anything similar to wow to begin with
[2022-12-31 13:11:23] <%Tyki_jp> @Braggardt It's more of WoW dungeons feel more open compared to FF14. I personally like both cause they fit
[2022-12-31 13:11:27] <%+SiriusSion> GW2 was never really a wow clone

[2022-12-31 13:11:33] <bethrezen90> when i played GW2 what i dislicked the most is the questing, it's like doing world quests non stop

[2022-12-31 13:11:36] <%Criptonix100> only Fractals and Raids

[2022-12-31 13:11:48] <%+Bashiel> gw1 and GW2 are very different
[2022-12-31 13:11:53] <Trafikk_> Fractals^
[2022-12-31 13:11:59] <Kaldiin> Game with no trinity usually have one job that do both tank and healing
[2022-12-31 13:12:03] <%+BinksMagnus> Rift got away from trinity a little bit with support classes but not great
[2022-12-31 13:12:05] <%+YuushaEX> i had fun levelling in GW2 but i found theres a stall point midway through where it slows down
[2022-12-31 13:12:05] <thedevilsjester> hey @Preachlfw just started watching you again and was wondering as a casual player, can only play around 5 hours a week. Are there any MMO's you would recommend? The only MMO ive played long term was Rift back in the day
[2022-12-31 13:12:07] <+awkswow> raids aren't the pinnacle content in gw2 either

[2022-12-31 13:12:16] <%Tyki_jp> @Braggardt ohyea, that's for sure. Optimizing just scale things down as usual

[2022-12-31 13:12:32] <@%Methuzahla> GW2, ESO
[2022-12-31 13:12:33] <%EeraGames> I found ESO really weird as a new player, the dungeons were basically speedran and I had no idea where I was going or doing. It's like how I feel new players to FF would feel nowadays
[2022-12-31 13:12:34] <@%Methuzahla> <3
[2022-12-31 13:12:41] <+Kurban2112> You wont really feel the best of GW dungeons until 80 with Fractal Dungeons, as the levelling dungeons are made of spaghetti and long abandoned by the devs.
[2022-12-31 13:12:46] <%+Cirsiena> ff14 is chill
[2022-12-31 13:12:55] <@%Methuzahla> ESO and GW2 are my bae
[2022-12-31 13:12:56] <%+YuushaEX> i play FF for story, WoW for combat, and Destiny for both
[2022-12-31 13:12:59] <+Cookie_Fanatic> @EeraGames if you think people speedrun ff dungeons go try wow
[2022-12-31 13:13:17] <%Tyki_jp> @YuushaEX I wouldn't vouch for Destiny after how shitty they've been acting with players
[2022-12-31 13:13:21] <morspog> @EeraGames started playing with my friends and yeah never seen people hurry through a dungeon like that even in wow

[2022-12-31 13:13:26] <Funderik> @Braggardt  depends how you take it, the whole point of m+ in wow is to climb score, get better loot.

[2022-12-31 13:13:37] <%Dragonnan> @thedevilsjester See? Just as I said, hahaha.
[2022-12-31 13:13:38] <+XeroEUW> @Preachlfw I loved Gw2 and played it a ton. Almost all Classes. Gearing is very boring and super slow, you won't really be using normal Dungeons or anything in gw2 - fractals and raids is almost your only choice for gearing. That being said, almost everything is account bound, which is GREAT!
[2022-12-31 13:13:41] <%MaehDraws> wow has a story?1

[2022-12-31 13:13:53] <@%Methuzahla> and jumping puzzles
[2022-12-31 13:13:57] <%$Azikielboi> ff's story is not for everyone, its very shounen

[2022-12-31 13:14:02] <Shakotan141> What i still hate about the WoW mentality is people trying to speed through e v e r y t h i n g
[2022-12-31 13:14:06] <bethrezen90> Same as WoW :D
[2022-12-31 13:14:07] <%Dragonnan> @Preachlfw It's not THAT hard to care about it... But SL certainly made it much harder/worse.
[2022-12-31 13:14:08] <%spejspag> I did care about WoW story, but comparing it to FF14 is cruel KEKW

[2022-12-31 13:14:17] <%Syrjyys> Now that I've been playing WoW again I think that I actually prefer FF combat, some aspects a sure better in WoW but as an overall package

[2022-12-31 13:14:25] <Dreion> @Methuzahla I love the puzzles but I can't really get into the actual jumping if that makes any sense. Feels too floaty
[2022-12-31 13:14:25] <%+Bashiel> @methuzahla GW2 has by far the best mount system in any MMO
[2022-12-31 13:14:30] <Funderik> ff14 story is way to fucking long, too many pointless cutscenes

[2022-12-31 13:14:53] <numinuminumnumnum> @Shakotan141 It's a big problem pugging m+ or pugging a tank, some just try to do high optimized speed strats that don't work if everyone isn't on the same level
[2022-12-31 13:14:55] <Goraka91> @Funderik If you think they're pointless it just ain't the game for you man KEKW

[2022-12-31 13:15:05] <%spejspag> @bearberrycheesecake Nah, all FF games are separate
[2022-12-31 13:15:05] <%+hodiaa> not enough Sadge
[2022-12-31 13:15:07] <ultrabonezone> what sword?

[2022-12-31 13:15:16] <%+nvwls> what about when the Jailer got all the sigils?
[2022-12-31 13:15:17] <%Dragonnan> I haven't cried because of FF14.... I bawled. Like a bitch.
[2022-12-31 13:15:18] <%Miss_Kas> PepeHands
[2022-12-31 13:15:19] <pringlez91> wow still great regardless
[2022-12-31 13:15:20] <Kirzan> It was so sad when Thrall became a nobody 😴
[2022-12-31 13:15:21] <urbish_> PepeHands jailer
[2022-12-31 13:15:24] <Overnoes> brought to tears by the rat ratJAM
[2022-12-31 13:15:27] <%+Adriannn_11> Madge the twins better not end up like ff6 twins
[2022-12-31 13:15:29] <Magicstickstv> Wow does a very poor job of telling it's story in game, with the book and Lore of old it is a great fantasy world imo but poor executed ingame
[2022-12-31 13:15:30] <Carrotlet> BOOBA jailer
[2022-12-31 13:15:31] <%tinyjazzhands> stupid weeb game Madge
[2022-12-31 13:15:32] <radassroach> Jailer did it all for us Sadge
[2022-12-31 13:15:32] <Trafikk_> GW" combat is far more action combat... Dodges and I-Frames
[2022-12-31 13:15:37] <Trafikk_> GW2
[2022-12-31 13:15:37] <professionalbabo> yeah cried of happiness when the oversized smurf died KEKW
[2022-12-31 13:15:37] <hustlehoof> chills when he warned us about the next big bad
[2022-12-31 13:15:39] <LasyPanda> I cried when jailor died, tears of joy that Shadowland is over
[2022-12-31 13:15:41] <skybalr> Zoval complexity > emet
[2022-12-31 13:15:42] <Shakotan141> @numinuminumnumnumNo just that, but i had a Mythic 0 dungeon recently and the group just stressed the fuck out of a new tank, running ahead pulling and shit
[2022-12-31 13:15:42] <%+Rhob> I wish I cared about WoW story, got spoiled by FFXIV really
[2022-12-31 13:15:43] <Goraka91> Weeb game (No vulpera)
[2022-12-31 13:15:46] <%XRay2x> the only time I cried at wow was when I saw azerite armor
[2022-12-31 13:15:46] <Xithamas> I cried on jailer kill as well, no loot for me Sadge
[2022-12-31 13:15:47] <numinuminumnumnum> I cried when Baine sat in Oribos all xpac, imagine how depressed you gotta be?!
[2022-12-31 13:15:47] <nelchien> PepeHands the jailer was protecting us from a greater evil
[2022-12-31 13:15:48] <Shakotan141> *not just that
[2022-12-31 13:15:50] <Narva95> PepeLaugh got him
[2022-12-31 13:15:55] <Radium_Lavans> They just killed all the story with Arthas
[2022-12-31 13:15:56] <+Kurban2112> I feel GW2 tells the story the best in this medium of mmos, but the story is better in 14.

[2022-12-31 13:16:05] <%+Bashiel> wow have good world building, and some great stories in side content, but the main story is kinda meh
[2022-12-31 13:16:07] <+Huduu> Wheres the damage meter zug zug
[2022-12-31 13:16:08] <Kirzan> Do you think Metzen will bring Thrall back?
[2022-12-31 13:16:09] <Funderik> @Goraka91 that's not how it works. you can enjoy something but still find pieces of it a pointless time sink.
[2022-12-31 13:16:10] <urbish_> i could get into the WoW story more if the voice acting didnt suck
[2022-12-31 13:16:14] <%$sundayz58> Jussy  PepeHands
[2022-12-31 13:16:15] <%+Rhob> Better but by no means engaging
[2022-12-31 13:16:25] <+XeroEUW> Am I the only one who sort of disliked the story of FF14? I mean ARR was nice, but afterwards, a lot of the story was very "gummy" and took so, so, so long to resolve. FF14 is a great game though, classes were fun :)
[2022-12-31 13:16:27] <%+SaikoS7ven> Razageth is  still the same old baddy, tho.
[2022-12-31 13:16:31] <DemonicAvatar> @nelchien story repeats itself to much.....Illidan protected us, than Sageras than Jailer.....yada yada yada
[2022-12-31 13:16:31] <Radium_Lavans> We are all weebs now
[2022-12-31 13:16:31] <%LucklessXIII> Wish I could get into WoW but starting solo just feels a bit rough for me

[2022-12-31 13:16:35] <eldyboo> The emotional core of WOW's story was the sidequests NODDERS
[2022-12-31 13:16:37] <Goraka91> @Kurban2112 It's definitely easier for alts, an alt on 14 is true pain KEKW
[2022-12-31 13:16:37] <%Braggardt> Dragonflight's story is very milquetoast so far, but it is presented a lot better than previous expansions
[2022-12-31 13:16:38] <+Chewmii> i dont really care any of the characters
[2022-12-31 13:16:38] <%+jhazor> i really loved the side quest with that dwarf at the life pools - just a small thing listening to his regrets
[2022-12-31 13:16:43] <%+YuushaEX> who is the next big baddy in 10.1
[2022-12-31 13:16:45] <%+Bashiel> the biggest issue for me in wow story is that my character don't really feel impactful

[2022-12-31 13:16:56] <+Bakanoodle> @XeroEUW and that's ok, not all stories are for everyone
[2022-12-31 13:16:57] <%Criptonix100> @Kurban2112 GW1 was the best DnD story and gameplay inspired game...GW2 had it's good moments till ICB Saga...

[2022-12-31 13:17:06] <numinuminumnumnum> @Shakotan141 Yeah, if there's a game to fear tanking, it's WoW, such high pressure and expectation, doesn't help for raiding you get shafted so WoW got a tank problem more so than FF

[2022-12-31 13:17:12] <Funderik> but that also gives you and new players the freedom to not have to do EVERY expansion in order to get to current content.
[2022-12-31 13:17:12] <+Cookie_Fanatic> every time you kill the end boss it turns out there is a mysterious worse end boss that you didnt know about, its kinda boring at this point
[2022-12-31 13:17:12] <+Lunagx> i played each expansion, but this time i got to 70 on my lightforged paladin and thats it, havent touched it since, its just doesnt grip me.

[2022-12-31 13:17:19] <%Vinestra28> @Kurban2112 GW2 story is fair fun (EXCEPT FOR THE Fire and Ice story arc and how it ended Madge ) its only downside is slow af updates..
[2022-12-31 13:17:20] <7Sevyne7> Isnt their a fun little nod to xiv in a dragonflight quest? Think one say Pray Return to hte waking shores or something like that.
[2022-12-31 13:17:21] <$toaladelta> @XeroEUW thats the first time ive heard anyone prefer ARR over what comes after lmao

[2022-12-31 13:18:21] <%+jhazor> @Adriannn_11 yeas but for the 2nd tier materials you need a coin from both alliance and for 3rd tier you'll need one from all 3 alliance

[2022-12-31 13:20:34] <numinuminumnumnum> @Kurban2112 Can imagine, imo the good stuff comes in the LW story stuff, it's like LW are series and xpac is a movie, movie can be satisfying with the series but can't carry by itself, whilst LW is where you got all intriguing mysteries and small plots

[2022-12-31 13:20:58] <%MaehDraws> im NA and playing, its fine
[2022-12-31 13:20:59] <vulkankragon> we really need a glamour lag. its hightime.
[2022-12-31 13:20:59] <%+Yurian33> wait... Sloots in austrailia now?
[2022-12-31 13:21:03] <%+Armst> Destiny 2 Raiding at the start of March? NODDERS

[2022-12-31 13:21:12] <incognitofoxo> in FFXIV OCE to EU is awfull tho
[2022-12-31 13:21:16] <%Vinestra28> @Kurban2112 @numinuminumnumnum Agreed post 2nd expansion LW was pretty hype. Then IBS happens and its just.. starts good then shits the bed..

[2022-12-31 13:21:28] <Dreion> @Kurban2112 Really liking the latest expac though, love the zones so far. Kinda on hiatus for now though, I kept running into random lag spikes on some instances/maps
[2022-12-31 13:21:29] <%+Yurian33> ok thats very different from austrailia "_
[2022-12-31 13:21:30] <%w061a09> really want to see u play other melee jobs, each of em has very different feeling
[2022-12-31 13:21:40] <%dragothicx> I've never done Alliance Raids on release day because MSQ is a prio.. should I?
[2022-12-31 13:21:41] <%LucklessXIII> What world are we talking? I might see what the ping is like then
[2022-12-31 13:21:42] <%MaehDraws> I get 110 playing EU from NA.
[2022-12-31 13:21:48] <%+DMG9> ninja!
[2022-12-31 13:21:51] <%KaiZen2048> even reaper?
[2022-12-31 13:21:52] <cobrakeiser> ninja is Pog
[2022-12-31 13:21:53] <pringlez91> WoW melee is the best
[2022-12-31 13:21:54] <%Mid_Halt> Dragoon the best
[2022-12-31 13:21:57] <+gorblade_69> Latency in WoW was mora a thing when everyone was on dial-up and 2,5 Mbit adsl.
[2022-12-31 13:21:57] <%+Mak2349> try DRG
[2022-12-31 13:21:58] <ethanlee_33> floor tank?
[2022-12-31 13:21:59] <Dreion> @Kurban2112 Yeah LW4 kinda lit
[2022-12-31 13:22:00] <%+Boomslang552> Ninja is kinda fun
[2022-12-31 13:22:00] <Zenithiv> Try ninja or sam
[2022-12-31 13:22:00] <%Hammerjaz> Ninja time? Finally
[2022-12-31 13:22:00] <Goraka91> @dragothicx If you like chaos PepeLaugh
[2022-12-31 13:22:00] <%+Juskr> monk or ninja? PauseChamp
[2022-12-31 13:22:01] <$soulblues> ninja is interesting
[2022-12-31 13:22:02] <%LucklessXIII> Monk is my favorite job in FF, it's definitely unique though
[2022-12-31 13:22:03] <%KaiZen2048> You need melds dood
[2022-12-31 13:22:04] <$toaladelta> I would recommend trying monk, its a very fast and unique style
[2022-12-31 13:22:04] <%dragothicx> AST Pog
[2022-12-31 13:22:05] <mrmemoiman> go monk and fist everyone GIGACHAD
[2022-12-31 13:22:06] <Maddroxv> do monk probably the most complex and fastest melee
[2022-12-31 13:22:09] <%+Adriannn_11> Almost past out D:
[2022-12-31 13:22:09] <Currentswow> ggggggggggggg's
[2022-12-31 13:22:10] <+Kurban2112> Monk is fun, but only after level 70 imo.
[2022-12-31 13:22:11] <fiendrumble> tyty
[2022-12-31 13:22:11] <%Vinestra28> @Kurban2112 @Dreion Same.. waiting for the next story to begin.. and much like FFxiv see where it goes from said ending.
[2022-12-31 13:22:11] <%Mid_Halt> Reaper is the most boring Melee
[2022-12-31 13:22:12] <+KpopOrc> cmoon i just joined Madge
[2022-12-31 13:22:13] <%+YuushaEX> HOW MUCH YOU BENCH
[2022-12-31 13:22:13] <numinuminumnumnum> @Kurban2112 Yeah, post 2nd LW had such amazing characters and character development, very intriguing and you could barely guess where things were going, until the end Sadge
[2022-12-31 13:22:14] <Xann7> I think you would like Monk

[2022-12-31 13:22:58] <%Vinestra28> @Kurban2112 @numinuminumnumnum Shame about the one male who begins with B and how his story went though..
[2022-12-31 13:23:00] <%porridgeu> Have a good one all
[2022-12-31 13:23:01] <vulkankragon> any news about the glamour log?
[2022-12-31 13:23:08] <%ProfChang> @LucklessXIII it's cross-server
[2022-12-31 13:23:37] <%LucklessXIII> @LucklessXIII Ah true, so just pick any EU server? Just wanted to gauge ping
[2022-12-31 13:23:54] <numinuminumnumnum> @Kurban2112 Yeah, big shame, especially me being a fan of the race and how under utilized it is, given it's meant to be full of giant heroes, but him and rest are treated like humans
[2022-12-31 13:24:19] <Dreion> I might try going back to GW2 next year. For now I just get my dailies then dip
[2022-12-31 13:24:35] VIEWERS: 2 596
[2022-12-31 13:25:00] <%Vinestra28> @Kurban2112 @numinuminumnumnum aye.. + their big whole big bad story focus got wraped up rather limply in IBS.. (Seriously why name it that)..
[2022-12-31 13:25:07] <%LucklessXIII> GW2 had 300 ping for me, sadly. Wished I could have gotten into it more but it felt like I had no goals or anything
[2022-12-31 13:25:09] ~Stream offline~
[2022-12-31 13:25:49] <%Vinestra28> NODDERS that is one downside to it is goals feel pretty hard to have in gw2.. outside of story and seeing the zones/collections.
[2022-12-31 13:25:50] <Dreion> On a good day, I get 240-ish ping and it plays alright. The previously mentioned lag spikes reach 3-4k though LUL
[2022-12-31 13:26:46] <numinuminumnumnum> @Kurban2112 Yee, which seems to be the xpac's fault when it was made due to there supposedly not being one planned but then had to rush and tie it in, either way, looking forward to 4th xpac, retraced all of GW1 now and I hope for something new, hopefully not human focused
[2022-12-31 13:27:14] <Dreion> Could always grind out some gold for future use
[2022-12-31 13:27:49] <%Vinestra28> @numinuminumnumnum IIRC it was more Arena net? or the devs kinda fuckin about doing things not for GW2 and their ceo overlrods stepped in and told them to work on the game.
[2022-12-31 13:28:18] <Dreion> I love how a lot of people hyped up the halloween event for newcomers and the activity they were so excited about was the maze
[2022-12-31 13:28:27] <%Vinestra28> Basically what happened with Anthem.. where the devs were just burning money nothing was getting mad?
[2022-12-31 13:28:34] <Dreion> Where you ran around the same map killing the same mobs for hours on end LUL
[2022-12-31 13:28:41] <%Vinestra28> Oh god.. Gw2 events feel... annoying.
[2022-12-31 13:28:55] <%Vinestra28> (also fucking limited inventory Madge )
[2022-12-31 13:29:24] <Dreion> Yeah I've read somewhere before that they were investing cash earned from GW2 on a now abandoned project
[2022-12-31 13:29:46] <numinuminumnumnum> @Vinestra28 I believe GW2 was close on getting kinda put on the side, but then was given a go for 2 more xpacs, the end of the LW after 2nd xpac ends in a way that's very "this is final" and the next story was bigger than normal LW focused on bringing small xpac content
[2022-12-31 13:30:01] <@%^Streamlabs> Check out our merch! https://preachgaming.com/shop/
[2022-12-31 13:30:10] <%Vinestra28> Aye basically RND but.. it basically amounted to really vauge concept like blizzard titan but.. nothing came of it..
[2022-12-31 13:30:27] <%Vinestra28> @numinuminumnumnum aye.. waits to be seen Prayge may the next story be good and interesting.
[2022-12-31 13:30:39] <%Vinestra28> + more the new expansions map areas
[2022-12-31 13:31:18] <numinuminumnumnum> Same! I'm excited cause we've covered all of GW1 areas, there's nothing left so whatever next xpac brings will be all original areas and so forth!
[2022-12-31 13:32:27] <numinuminumnumnum> Either way, I'ma be off, happy new year guys!
[2022-12-31 13:32:35] <%LucklessXIII> So that's interesting, when I create a character in WoW on the EU servers, my Home ping is 196ms, while my World ping is 319ms - not too sure what the difference is, but
