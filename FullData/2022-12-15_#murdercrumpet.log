[2022-12-15 23:50:23] <%BlueGrif> Treatment ‚Äì The most common treatment of hereditary hemochromatosis is removal of blood (phlebotomy), which lowers the amount of iron in the body. Phlebotomy is similar to the process of donating blood. It is usually done once per week until the body iron levels have decreased to normal.

[2022-12-15 23:50:42] <%CharlieElm> The time scale of replenishing blood and iron makes donation not effective in the long term. That's all that matters if you're trying to treat high/low iron.

[2022-12-15 23:51:02] <%Bewberries> iron is part of blood production from the start. so iron is needed before blood is made

[2022-12-15 23:51:28] <%$Leetween> If you ate NOTING with iron then yes, otherwise the people that have more iron will still absorb more than regular blood

[2022-12-15 23:51:34] <%thedaren> MurderCrumpet the most common treatment for hemochromatosis (abundance of iron in your system) is literally removing blood.

[2022-12-15 23:52:03] <%Miskav> Crumpet right
[2022-12-15 23:52:06] <%Veacari> Crumpet is right in this case, if you are donating actual blood, and not just plasma. But if you maintain the same diet you will build up towards the same amount of iron.

[2022-12-15 23:54:06] <%SVPV> Can high iron levels be reversed? Treatment of hereditary hemochromatosis requires removal of excessive iron from the body, usually by periodically removing blood (referred to as "therapeutic phlebotomy").

[2022-12-15 23:54:37] <%fbi4ever> Iron is a main component of blood cell ‚Ä¶. High iron cause darker color and vice verse‚Ä¶. Blood cells production in bone marrow which already contain the optimum level of iron ‚Ä¶ naturally
