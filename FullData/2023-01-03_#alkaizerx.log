[2023-01-03 00:34:06] <uhhhhahhhhohahhh> @paulbeanis nice strawman. the point is quin's build is viable for him because he plays the game on launch more than almost every other person. it wouldn't work for an average gamer

[2023-01-03 00:50:38] <Retrofresh> i swear the "ban skills" crap only would eliminate kill submissions, meaning you'd just seismic 99% of the time, and reroll to kill the boss
[2023-01-03 00:50:39] <%Teslife> Probably there wasnt any changes last year so ppl come up with their own shit

[2023-01-03 00:51:27] <Retrofresh> if they ban seismic everyone will just cold dot
[2023-01-03 00:51:31] <%PedrovskiTV> banning submissions only is even dumber cause everyone will use seismic to farm gear for another character
[2023-01-03 00:51:35] <mycull_santearna> let me play cold dot and work on a gear for seismic => upcoming gauntlet
[2023-01-03 00:51:35] <Retrofresh> if they ban cold dot ppl will just poison minion

[2023-01-03 00:52:15] <uhhhhahhhhohahhh> i think they need to do gauntlet with banned skills to show how shit the skill balance is. i dont think even Ben will be able to win gauntlet with certain skills in the timeframe
