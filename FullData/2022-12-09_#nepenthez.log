[2022-12-09 15:26:43] <ZeebruhPOG> @footballfan1543 I‚Äôve had both. They are both great. Whichever is easier to link. Wijnaldum is a little more agile but Brozo has amazing passing

[2022-12-09 15:30:07] <ZeebruhPOG> @footballfan1543 I imagine Brozo is very similar to him. So if you need a more agile attacking CM I‚Äôd go Wijnaldum but running Brozo wouldn‚Äôt be bad either. Whichever you prefer

[2022-12-09 15:34:10] <+Mankehhh> Mans out here getting 10-0 and I barley get 4 wins üòÖ
[2022-12-09 15:34:10] <+FreddieG_TV> Do or do not - there is no try
[2022-12-09 15:34:13] <huntingbeesbb> 9-0? I never tried winning the rest of games after qualifying xD
[2022-12-09 15:34:15] <yossiwire151> show uru team
[2022-12-09 15:34:20] <ZeebruhPOG> @footballfan1543 I imagine Brozo is best at CDM or CM. He can definitely defend. Just depends what you like. Wijnaldum has amazing dribbling and agile. He wins a lot of balls back too. Brozo is just a beast at passing and also defense
[2022-12-09 15:34:31] <thewalsallswift> its insane to think champs was once 40 games, how did we manage it?
[2022-12-09 15:34:42] <+FreddieG_TV> Brozo is slept on - his dribbling and agility feels like wijnaldums
[2022-12-09 15:34:42] <vegarking> @austenfishermann please don't, I really need France to win mate

[2022-12-09 15:59:27] <JimmyTheBits> Why did the keeper use the opposite hand?
[2022-12-09 15:59:27] <%montywastakentwice> keeper animations are awful this year
[2022-12-09 15:59:31] <here4rewards_> theres a knuckle ball exploit that glitches the GK
[2022-12-09 15:59:33] <jeff251293> Joke

[2022-12-09 15:59:51] <xOmsSs96> outside the foot free kicks are broken, another new feature that doesn't have counter to it
[2022-12-09 15:59:53] <%+Golderlight123> yeah, they messed up the goalkeepers - they made them worse
[2022-12-09 15:59:53] <d1as_xix> F
[2022-12-09 15:59:54] <%montywastakentwice> not bad packs
[2022-12-09 16:00:00] <+disco__biscuit__> recent patch did something to GKs on free kicks, I had two scored on me last night right down the middle, keeper dove to one of the corners
[2022-12-09 16:00:01] <@%+Owen_Slater> I think its the Power FK trait, I had Puskas last year and if it hit the target it was a goal
[2022-12-09 16:00:04] <+Pughy30> Nep how have you been finding opponents on old gen?
[2022-12-09 16:00:04] <fx1476> some players are just really lucky. theres not much you can do about it

[2022-12-09 16:12:03] <@%Witchwalker70> üòÉ

[2022-12-09 16:12:31] <ben210990> i think you
[2022-12-09 16:12:34] <@%Witchwalker70> ooh nearly
[2022-12-09 16:12:38] <%$ItsTr3ple> You guys absolutely need to exploit Kound√©'s side
[2022-12-09 16:12:38] <+Pughy30> England have looked better than Argentina imo
[2022-12-09 16:12:41] <%theJFKexperience0> Portugal is top 4
[2022-12-09 16:12:41] <+Turdferguson85> Morocco all the way
[2022-12-09 16:12:44] <ben210990> i think you've downplayed england there and overplayed argentina
[2022-12-09 16:12:45] <%montywastakentwice> at the moment I think Argentina aren't really on their best
[2022-12-09 16:12:51] <@%Witchwalker70> Croatia have started brightly
[2022-12-09 16:13:10] <%sorarejosh> i think bellingham can cause that french midfield problems
[2022-12-09 16:13:11] <stackmillz> ya i biult 20 for 2day and ya it did cost like 80k but i had nuthing in my club
[2022-12-09 16:13:17] <%montywastakentwice> hey its one game who knows what can happen
[2022-12-09 16:13:17] <Godgyllf> Portugal with Ronaldo stand no chance at winning it, Portugal without Ronaldo will have a chance LUL
[2022-12-09 16:13:17] <bencapwn> besides messi  argentina aint much
[2022-12-09 16:13:18] <%$ItsTr3ple> He can Josh
[2022-12-09 16:13:26] <eltorrooow> @montywastakentwice so far argentina is messi and 10 helpers (no disrespect)
[2022-12-09 16:13:30] <%+justin26sane> @eltorrooow sorry for spelling it wrong could of just answered instead of being a smart arse
[2022-12-09 16:13:31] <%+adamo419> even if we beat France we'll most likely have Portugal after that then Brazil or Argentina in the Final aswell it'll be a task to win it all
[2022-12-09 16:13:31] <jolito1417> Who‚Äôs gonna win parsnep
[2022-12-09 16:13:38] <%+L1D5TER27> I just hope we see England win somthing in my lifetime
[2022-12-09 16:13:45] <%$ItsTr3ple> Absolutely
[2022-12-09 16:13:50] <%$ItsTr3ple> If you act scared you're f'ed
[2022-12-09 16:13:53] <jeri____> What‚Äôs content droppin?
[2022-12-09 16:13:53] <+gsinc12345> It's scary how strong France are considering half their team are out injured  what an immense squad
[2022-12-09 16:14:00] <%montywastakentwice> @eltorrooow yeh but they have been poor
[2022-12-09 16:14:04] <ben210990> are we only not the favourites because France have Mbappe though? because we're better than them everywhere else
[2022-12-09 16:14:06] <jamiep1999> England sitting back is a recipe for disaster
[2022-12-09 16:14:06] <eltorrooow> @justin26sane brother just take it lighthartened i didnt offend you in any way
[2022-12-09 16:14:12] <+nelsonthegreat8> Hello from Portugal
[2022-12-09 16:14:15] <%$ItsTr3ple> What ?
[2022-12-09 16:14:17] <+Turdferguson85> Wish the US did the opposite vs the Dutch.
[2022-12-09 16:14:18] <stackmillz> england gotta start saka and foden if they want a chance
[2022-12-09 16:14:22] <%montywastakentwice> @eltorrooow they could be doing so much better
[2022-12-09 16:14:24] <@Calzuhgg> Bellingham will score a hattrick then lift up his top to reveal he's joining Liverpool
[2022-12-09 16:14:24] <%$Apple22> think mbappe and dembele will cause chaos for us
[2022-12-09 16:14:25] <+Turdferguson85> We were awful in transition
[2022-12-09 16:14:27] <AHumanAlien> Have to play 4-3-3 and by the sounds of interview Southgate gave it seems the case
[2022-12-09 16:14:29] <%+TheRealClubhouse> France are good top to bottom
[2022-12-09 16:14:33] <Godgyllf> Dont underestimate Giroud, he can be a real problem
[2022-12-09 16:14:33] <jonathanlloyd47> bruh, france have varane lol
[2022-12-09 16:14:47] <Draziel21> hey guys. i m french and i wish we win against you. but if you attack, arent you risking a quick counter attack?
[2022-12-09 16:14:48] <%jjaden10> Worse coach too
[2022-12-09 16:14:49] <%+adamo419> we have to play like how we played Vs Wales
[2022-12-09 16:14:50] <%+justin26sane> @eltorrooow could of just answered though couldn't you
[2022-12-09 16:14:54] <%montywastakentwice> start the right players we can definitely have fair shout
[2022-12-09 16:15:01] <%$ItsTr3ple> @Draziel21 Another fenchman ?? W
[2022-12-09 16:15:05] <%$ItsTr3ple> Frenchman
[2022-12-09 16:15:07] <eltorrooow> @montywastakentwice well im dutch so i pray if they play better its after they play us xD
[2022-12-09 16:15:14] <%+L1D5TER27> who would u start in the middle nep to control it? would u have hendo back in
[2022-12-09 16:15:18] <ben210990> insanse back line i think is pushing it, Kounde at right back looks like a massive weak link
[2022-12-09 16:15:32] <%montywastakentwice> @eltorrooow hahahaha me too
[2022-12-09 16:15:33] <%$coys51> Hendo got to play imo
[2022-12-09 16:15:37] <girldiator> Worse goalie
[2022-12-09 16:15:37] <jkf_3110> idk how people think shaw is better than theo lol
[2022-12-09 16:15:43] <%$ItsTr3ple> A part from Jude, I don't think we'd take any of your players in our 11 right now, in my opinion of course
[2022-12-09 16:15:46] <eltorrooow> @justin26sane brother dont be angry over a joke, chill a bit
[2022-12-09 16:15:47] <jonathanlloyd47> brazil will lose this match if they keep joking like this
[2022-12-09 16:15:50] <%sorarejosh> they haven't even kept a single CS yet, defo vulnerable at the back
[2022-12-09 16:16:06] <%montywastakentwice> Brazil look shakey
[2022-12-09 16:16:12] <%$ItsTr3ple> Nope, I wouldn't, genuinely. But I really do not like Kane so I'm biased LUL
[2022-12-09 16:16:17] <%$coys51> Kane would bag it the French team
[2022-12-09 16:16:20] <@Calzuhgg> @sorarejosh It's all part of the masterplan
[2022-12-09 16:16:21] <%+ironvine34> Kane so underrated
[2022-12-09 16:16:23] <%montywastakentwice> kane rashford mappe
[2022-12-09 16:16:28] <ben210990> yeah Kane would clean up in that team
[2022-12-09 16:16:33] <+00_SW33TCHiiNMUSiiC__> even though weve only conceded 2 and that was in the 1st game after being like 6-0 up, id feel more confident if Tomori was in the back line
[2022-12-09 16:16:38] <+nelsonthegreat8> Maguire Over Varane is clear üòÖ
[2022-12-09 16:16:51] <%$ItsTr3ple> Kane seem to always be dropping in the midfield it's infuriating
[2022-12-09 16:16:54] <%+L1D5TER27> look what kane gets out of son having a speedster wloff him
[2022-12-09 16:16:56] <eltorrooow> the problem with kane in England imo he wants to do too much
[2022-12-09 16:17:03] <vendra_2> theo - mbappe on the left is LETAL 2020Celebrate
[2022-12-09 16:17:09] <eltorrooow> @itstr3ple exactly that
[2022-12-09 16:17:15] <%$coys51> Maguire's lack of pace worries me big time
[2022-12-09 16:17:15] <whippydrew> fave country to visit?
[2022-12-09 16:17:30] <%jjaden10> Just packed Haaland
[2022-12-09 16:17:31] <stackmillz> dont deviate from the plan nepo cuz im curious how long it takes realistically to get a milli juss from gameplay
[2022-12-09 16:17:32] <+x_peachcobbler_x> waddup Nep
[2022-12-09 16:17:39] <%jjaden10> And Nagatomo
[2022-12-09 16:17:44] <eltorrooow> @itstr3ple he wants to do to much for an out and out striker
[2022-12-09 16:17:50] <%$ItsTr3ple> Yep @eltorrooow
[2022-12-09 16:17:51] <%+jimmy01079> got baggio in player pick let's go
[2022-12-09 16:18:02] <+Yianni33> On the PC market now and contracts are selling. Nice way to get a small coin boost
[2022-12-09 16:18:11] <%$ItsTr3ple> Okay you know what, I'll take it back, Walker over Kound√©
[2022-12-09 16:18:12] <%montywastakentwice> these packs are crap
[2022-12-09 16:18:17] <%+Golderlight123> wasn't me :D
[2022-12-09 16:18:17] <AHumanAlien> @stackmillz Oh is that something he's trying? A million coins from Gameplay?
[2022-12-09 16:18:18] <Draziel21> Hi Nep, thanks for the content. yesterday i sent you a donation with a message saying i might be able to give a humble clue/exxplanation about "why EA makes the game a certain way?" you can either check "intermittent reinforcement" on google, or i can humbly tell you about it if you have few min. great holidays and new promo to everyone
[2022-12-09 16:18:18] <+Turdferguson85> I can confirm they are not juiced
[2022-12-09 16:18:19] <+CarlBildtThisCity> i did 4 and got 3 walkouts
[2022-12-09 16:18:21] <b33fbonk> they are watered down packs
[2022-12-09 16:18:25] <chieftape> what an absolute tuneeeee
[2022-12-09 16:18:26] <+JmeLFC> honestly get better pulls out of the gold upgrade
[2022-12-09 16:18:26] <%jjaden10> I got 2 walkouts out of 5
[2022-12-09 16:18:28] <luke_____21> Dilute juice
[2022-12-09 16:18:36] <OBJayAllDay> got Messi out of 6
[2022-12-09 16:18:43] <jonathanlloyd47> England are not gonna man mark Mbappe because they believe they r on par with france which will be a huge mistake
[2022-12-09 16:18:51] <+Turdferguson85> Those Icon packs were juiced. These were not.
[2022-12-09 16:18:58] <ben210990> Croatia looking comfortable in this game
[2022-12-09 16:19:02] [Notification] JamesGracie subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months, currently on a 1 month streak!
[2022-12-09 16:19:05] <eltorrooow> @itstr3ple kounde is more of a centreback imo france have no great rightbacks
[2022-12-09 16:19:20] <%$ItsTr3ple> We do, Clauss, but he didn't get the call @eltorrooow
[2022-12-09 16:19:21] <%+adamo419> i did 13 and got like 5 walkouts including Benzema and the rest boards minimum
[2022-12-09 16:19:22] <%montywastakentwice> finally

[2022-12-09 16:21:48] <bencapwn> cant taker it anymore this cliffhanger is to strong
[2022-12-09 16:21:50] <eltorrooow> @itstr3ple i heard a rumour benzema might rejoin the squad for the final, any truth in that?
[2022-12-09 16:21:51] <joeyskylar> why didnt Brazil and Croatia get showdown cards tho
[2022-12-09 16:21:59] <%$ItsTr3ple> Nope @eltorrooow He won't
[2022-12-09 16:22:13] <johnfive21> It was expected Spain would win
[2022-12-09 16:22:18] <casualguy_57> Croatia have a good chance to win
[2022-12-09 16:22:18] <bencapwn> we get another dutch showdown Kappa
[2022-12-09 16:22:23] <eltorrooow> @itstr3ple not as a starter but just to be in the squad
[2022-12-09 16:22:35] <johnfive21> But Spain - Morocco had showdown
[2022-12-09 16:22:40] <%$ItsTr3ple> No I can assure you he won't @eltorrooow
[2022-12-09 16:22:51] <AHumanAlien> Where that humble explanation from the donator?
[2022-12-09 16:23:00] <joeyskylar> common ea logic
[2022-12-09 16:23:01] <%jjaden10> Anyone remember when we were supposed to get Dynamic Duos for every country
[2022-12-09 16:23:01] <+wilkomaxims19> the world is moving too fast NepentheZ
[2022-12-09 16:23:04] <+ismilann> EA gonna give us a Showdown Dutchman for Morocco - Portugal

[2022-12-09 16:24:23] <stackmillz> usa controlled that game they juss cant score goals lmao
[2022-12-09 16:24:28] <+Turdferguson85> The US was just awful in transition
[2022-12-09 16:24:29] <+ockyflocka> this song is so good
[2022-12-09 16:24:31] <eltorrooow> if pulisic scored 2nd minute it would have been a totally different game
[2022-12-09 16:24:44] <+Turdferguson85> No midfielders were tracking back on counters
[2022-12-09 16:24:44] <%$czechmate92576> if us had a forward with some class and composure ,coulda been diffy
[2022-12-09 16:24:44] <AHumanAlien> Like Mitrovic
[2022-12-09 16:24:49] <jester23y> Looked like a red to me
[2022-12-09 16:24:58] <jester23y> Nevermind
[2022-12-09 16:24:59] <%Arkuvio> Will VAR check a possible red for Brazil
[2022-12-09 16:25:00] <jester23y> Faking
[2022-12-09 16:25:02] <stackmillz> they shoulda brought ricardo pepe
[2022-12-09 16:25:02] <+samm_786> His foot was very high there
[2022-12-09 16:25:03] <jonathanlloyd47> Choupo-moting
[2022-12-09 16:25:03] <johnfive21> Pulisic and clinical does not go together
[2022-12-09 16:25:07] <%$ItsTr3ple> That was high
[2022-12-09 16:25:18] <ben210990> also 2 better CBs and they might be good on home soil in 4 years
[2022-12-09 16:25:21] <+itzRiqs> how did he miss that?

[2022-12-09 16:25:43] <+Turdferguson85> Balogun would be nice for the US
[2022-12-09 16:25:45] <jester23y> Of course it‚Äôs yellow Fifa wants Brazil on final

[2022-12-09 16:27:51] <Draziel21> intermittent reinforcement is considered the most powerful manipulation method. how it works? giving positiv...then giving nothing...it creates addiction...so we NEEED our drug dose/good content...but meanwhile we have to compensate some other way . the store is the perfect dose supply, because its not good but good enough to wait for the next good content... sorry its hard to explain shortly via chat ^^
[2022-12-09 16:28:00] <+xVENOMx313x> Wheres the humble explanation?
[2022-12-09 16:28:00] <%theJFKexperience0> The United States will be a powerhouse in 10-20 years time. Everyone always forgets everyone else has 100+ years of experience on us.

[2022-12-09 16:30:47] <Draziel21> we already know positiv reinforcement without knowing its name... thats how we train dogs per ex....... negativ reinforcement is the opposite... like being punished for something we considered normal... it creates a trauma that blocks you from doing normal things because of fear.

[2022-12-09 17:11:01] <linus_teo> he probably doesn't get many wins and can't find many games that's why he's being sweaty and toxic

[2022-12-09 17:12:02] <Bret__> @dangraham69 You could talk to the opponent in game?
[2022-12-09 17:12:11] <dangraham69> Yes @bret__
[2022-12-09 17:12:18] <mahsanikairan> Back in the day, we only had informs n man of the match
[2022-12-09 17:12:21] <+TheKingRetro> This year has been the best content year ever. I know we complain a lot but my team is insane in December compared to other years for no cost to me
[2022-12-09 17:12:33] <mahsanikairan> FIFA is nothing but trash now
[2022-12-09 17:12:48] <%josh_rawlins21057> Livakovic on fire
[2022-12-09 17:13:05] <+TheKingRetro> Did we get swaps last year? or was that 21?
[2022-12-09 17:13:09] <+thescampi> Retroking but where‚Äôs the true sense of achievement if we are all running 90 rated players in December?
[2022-12-09 17:13:17] <mahsanikairan> I mean we have too many useless cards, that decreases the value of regular gold cards
[2022-12-09 17:13:17] <linus_teo> wow cheesed right there
[2022-12-09 17:13:21] <%+Cavacom> i love how reliable Nep is. I know there will be a video at a certain time. does not matter what content. I love that

[2022-12-09 17:13:32] <Bret__> This should be his last pause
[2022-12-09 17:13:41] <+justadaftdad> players like this make me laugh. I'll throw a hairband on the controller just to piss him off more
[2022-12-09 17:13:42] <dangraham69> If we match, what objectives you need @nepenthez
[2022-12-09 17:13:49] <mahsanikairan> Gold cards use to b fun n useable
[2022-12-09 17:14:20] <mahsanikairan> I could go in a match with 70 rated golds n still win
[2022-12-09 17:14:49] <+TheKingRetro> @thescampi Some people say not enough content, some say too many 90 rated too early. They cant win

[2022-12-09 17:30:41] <+iTs_Adam_> @TheKingRetro someone suggested it to Boras in his stream and I have been using it since. I also find it helps massively when you are on the half way line and the opponent wants to play forward, but double RB forces them backwards

[2022-12-09 17:49:05] <stackmillz> either way i juss wanna see him in the prem
[2022-12-09 17:49:16] <bungy1988> @nepenthez do you think Arsenal have the funds for Bellingham though?
[2022-12-09 17:49:25] <%$oclarkk> they do dont they?
[2022-12-09 17:49:36] <%josh_rawlins21057> 100%
[2022-12-09 17:49:36] <%bazza3166> i agree with that
[2022-12-09 17:49:39] <%$oclarkk> oh mad
[2022-12-09 17:49:48] <%sorarejosh> yeah , its too punishing on gk's & def

[2022-12-09 17:50:01] <%+TheKingRetro> @bungy1988 You would be surprised what kinda money any team is willing to spend for him
[2022-12-09 17:50:03] <JammieDodge191> Thogden on the screen aha
[2022-12-09 17:50:04] <+FlushFactory52> I agree totally different game with extra 30 mins.
[2022-12-09 17:50:10] <linus_teo> then what about attackers who play 90 mins vs 120 mins
[2022-12-09 17:50:16] <@%Viperlization> what a nervy game christ
[2022-12-09 17:50:16] <stackmillz> croatia looks comfortable going to pks
[2022-12-09 17:50:22] <m_silky> I think the Brazilian manager made his subs to early
[2022-12-09 17:50:24] <%$oclarkk> penalties should count then if extra time does
[2022-12-09 17:50:29] <bozo10123> Croatia i good
[2022-12-09 17:50:33] <@%Viperlization> england fracne better not be like this tomorrow
[2022-12-09 17:50:41] <@%Viperlization> i'd rather of been bent over by france
[2022-12-09 17:50:58] <bungy1988> @thekingretro yea I agree with that but I didn‚Äôt think they had the money in the bank for them to be a contender to buy him that‚Äôs all
[2022-12-09 17:51:10] <%+Guiri1WHU> @Viperlization oh...
[2022-12-09 17:51:12] <cormach_pap> how come you are playing old gen?
[2022-12-09 17:51:14] <%+jaythemillerman> are we going to see Croatia beat Brazil here. can see a pens win again
[2022-12-09 17:51:23] <+twoodsy_> If a defender gets subbed out do they get the clean sheet bonus
[2022-12-09 17:51:23] <%bazza3166> what still blows my mind is mids still lose points for conceding but get nothing for clean sheets
[2022-12-09 17:51:37] <%+TheKingRetro> @bungy1988 They spent a lot last summer so IDK if they do now but they did before
[2022-12-09 17:51:39] <wwewwewwe121212> is old gen smoother?
[2022-12-09 17:51:43] <marlene101092> why is easy old gen?
[2022-12-09 17:51:56] <elportuguese> Hello! How are you doing today Nep?

[2022-12-09 17:52:02] <ImChazaa> PC is the hardest platform for FUT champs imo
[2022-12-09 17:52:06] <jahangirmusavi> Give him win at list
[2022-12-09 17:52:08] <%CeltHD> Bruno g dropped 100k already
[2022-12-09 17:52:17] <%Post_FUT_Clarity> this is 5th extra time for Croatia in last 2 world cups
[2022-12-09 17:52:22] <%+TheKingRetro> Should I do fut champs on old gen to get worse players?
[2022-12-09 17:52:22] <+vCaleb1> 8-0 currently with fully basic 442
[2022-12-09 17:52:30] <%tomw99_> Croatia midfield is unreal
[2022-12-09 17:52:31] <jorginhobestpenaltytaker> Hello Nep
[2022-12-09 17:52:41] <+jamieperry_99> How different does the game feel on old gen?
[2022-12-09 17:52:58] <d1as_xix> the game's looking tough for Brazil Croatia defending their ass off
[2022-12-09 17:53:08] <%hughr1983> Afternoon nep

[2022-12-09 17:53:16] <%Post_FUT_Clarity> I cant believe I dropped Livakovic for Emi Martinez
[2022-12-09 17:53:22] <%bazza3166> i had his common and went for costa instead pain
[2022-12-09 17:53:24] <%$oclarkk> was a coin flip between bono and livakovic thank fuck i chose livakovic
[2022-12-09 17:53:31] <+FlushFactory52> Tell you what there are some good teams in this world cup but no outstanding side
[2022-12-09 17:53:32] <%sorarejosh> cant imagine too many used livakovic in global cup
[2022-12-09 17:53:36] <fitzyyy7> Livakovic has to be due a big move in the summer after this performance
[2022-12-09 17:53:40] <%+dtf1325> neo. bergwijn is great up front
[2022-12-09 17:53:44] <thelittlest2k> what are the easiest tokens gotta start that shite now

[2022-12-09 17:53:48] <%Post_FUT_Clarity> yeah my thinking also
[2022-12-09 17:53:50] <MrMattyMam> How the fook is Antony and this Pedro guy coming on ahead of Martinelli it‚Äôs laughable
[2022-12-09 17:53:52] <casualguy_57> won't be surprised if livakovics saves a few pens
[2022-12-09 17:54:03] <d1as_xix> true
[2022-12-09 17:54:06] <%$oclarkk> @MrMattyMam dont bring antony into that lmao
[2022-12-09 17:54:06] <%josh_rawlins21057> How do u see overall rank in global cup
[2022-12-09 17:54:12] <kingdrage> will Bruno get another upgrade if brazil wins?
[2022-12-09 17:54:12] <%Post_FUT_Clarity> he had 45 against Japan and I dropped him because of that
[2022-12-09 17:54:29] <stemil19> but you can blame the team for that also, but i get the point
[2022-12-09 17:54:29] <d1as_xix> but that's because they have bad defensive structure and are easy to break down
[2022-12-09 17:54:29] <jahangirmusavi> U have to know I watch u every night and sleep üòÖ
[2022-12-09 17:54:30] <antoniot_CRO> thoughts about game

[2022-12-09 17:56:44] <+xpetrifyn> the new drotmund card has 90 dribbling and 85 defence.
[2022-12-09 17:56:45] <+FlushFactory52> Croatia have been solid today.  Modric is still class.
[2022-12-09 17:56:45] <MrMattyMam> @oclarkk mate he‚Äôs been terrible üò≠üò≠ sorry to say but Martinelli offers far more for brazil than what Antony does sorry you don‚Äôt want to hear that but when gabby played vs Cameroon was the best player on the pitch by a mile he‚Äôs been terrible ahaha
