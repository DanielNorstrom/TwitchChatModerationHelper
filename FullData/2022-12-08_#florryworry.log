[2022-12-08 09:09:14] <@^Nightbot> Hello Mr Florryworry COGGERS I see you haven't been getting "Separatists Sentiment" event recently. This event is caused by having more than 100% overextension when you take enough provinces from enemy. It seems you're not expanding fast enough then. Try to take more land in the next war. I hope this helps :)
[2022-12-08 09:09:27] <%DarkFV> @EmperorsArmpits patch is from 2014, there are 1000 provinces KEKW
[2022-12-08 09:09:28] <stefan67ko> Let me get this straight, this is an older patch with all the current DLC's?

[2022-12-08 09:31:58] <@micoplus> what surprises me the most is the speed of game, without all those patches and dlcs, code over code kills the performance
[2022-12-08 09:32:02] <%+Radast> I think game sucked before introducing cool mechanics but I was happier playing game back then

[2022-12-08 11:13:15] <@%$euivalexander> PUing a non-catholic horde Business
[2022-12-08 11:13:21] <Sh1tatsu> Coreing isnt viable this patch?
[2022-12-08 11:13:28] <!misopog_on> can units be movement-locked in this Patch?

[2022-12-08 11:13:35] <@erhan7410> @misopog_on nope
[2022-12-08 11:13:36] <Americanjake> Coring is irrelevant when you can integrate for free

[2022-12-08 12:55:21] <%alystear> @alystear imo it was a lot more convenient, you could hire single units and you had a specific limit of how many you could hire i think. but it was soooo much more convenient esp for colonizing and unsieging stuff
[2022-12-08 12:55:35] <%victor_xoda> @florryworry do u think about leave ur work and be full strimer?

This event is caused by having more than 100% overextension when you take enough provinces from enemy. It seems you're not expanding fast enough then. Try to take more land in the next war.
