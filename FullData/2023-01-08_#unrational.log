[2023-01-08 03:50:05] <%+ThatLarsGuy> I think they just want to have decent weapons sp they can get good content for the tube lol
[2023-01-08 03:50:09] <adamhove86> yeah, its like tripping an anxiety for bob
[2023-01-08 03:50:10] <BeefChunk> I think they just want youtube video continuity

[2023-01-08 03:50:16] <%xxxjpzxxx> No I don’t think so
[2023-01-08 03:50:22] <@%$T_Hoff> obviously FULL random seems better. maybe if it was before game 1. but you already had started with the one
[2023-01-08 03:50:28] <%dcomp1993> Damn good song here Gary

[2023-01-08 03:50:44] <BeefChunk> content yes, but they continuity for showing the build
[2023-01-08 03:50:47] <%+shellax> i agree with you they are using the best version of random guns thats not as fun
[2023-01-08 03:50:53] <@%$T_Hoff> no bc you got the 1st win with this generator so keep it goin i guess
[2023-01-08 03:51:10] <+Halpin_> Surly u want a generator with more variety
[2023-01-08 03:51:11] <%+Dmano135> After the frustration of stream snipers the last two days, they might want an “easy” day
[2023-01-08 03:51:13] <jackmacwz> funny attachments/sights definitely makes it more interesting
[2023-01-08 03:51:27] <%marijuanaut6> Maybe if you guys were just running lobbies instead of trying for a nuke they’d be more down?
[2023-01-08 03:51:28] <Doctor_Nerf> than if its best random attatchs, its not fully random
[2023-01-08 03:51:30] <Doctor_Nerf> hello?
[2023-01-08 03:51:36] <%+dudeimgeorge> why
[2023-01-08 03:51:43] <%dotwerdna> whole point is for nukes @marijuanaut6
[2023-01-08 03:51:45] <@%$T_Hoff> after this 5, suggest that
[2023-01-08 03:51:56] <%+dudeimgeorge> more variety.?
[2023-01-08 03:51:59] <@%$T_Hoff> FULL RANDOM is true random which is better i agree
[2023-01-08 03:51:59] <BeefChunk> I think they would swap if you weren't mid 3/5
[2023-01-08 03:52:05] <Doctor_Nerf> variety is always nice
[2023-01-08 03:52:06] <%jjgray17> what's the difference between them?
[2023-01-08 03:52:08] <%+dudeimgeorge> ohh
[2023-01-08 03:52:12] <@%$T_Hoff> like you can get an RPK and it wont be meta, it could have a 10x and be fucked
[2023-01-08 03:52:23] <%xxxjpzxxx> Don’t think they are Gary

[2023-01-08 03:52:48] <Doctor_Nerf> doesnt make sense
[2023-01-08 03:52:54] <%jjgray17> this one is better for sure
[2023-01-08 03:52:58] <@%$T_Hoff> if it wasnt 3/5 theyd switch, just keep riding it

I then went and rented a projector in a big field and all my villagers watched it and it changed their lives too. We all are so grateful. Thank You for this video….
