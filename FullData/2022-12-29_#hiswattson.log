[2022-12-29 14:53:07] <senpai_nymeria> @ekstaaz_fr that is true. but I feel him being a movement legend plays into the fact he's already op. he could do with a better passive and maybe like zipline healing buffs. but other than that he's op

[2022-12-29 19:05:32] <%Hitosherizu> Xera and HisWattson fighting again. Wattson just can't stay out of drama, right after he makes up with his former bestfriend Keon, he immediately starts drama with his own teammate Xera. Probably over the fact that Wattos is a noob.
