[2022-12-20 17:43:39] <+BroLeao> at least you can't get placed in plat and not play for the rest of the season anymore
[2022-12-20 17:43:57] <vllctor_> With cross progression, I got awarded 200+ esports packs. Unlocked all items in the BP without playing a single game
[2022-12-20 17:43:57] <%+Ihavelousyaim> CoD has a similar system for their battlepass which i guess is based on Fortnite? you unlock zones and adjacent zones are available....
