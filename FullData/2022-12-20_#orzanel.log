[2022-12-20 08:57:01] <@^Nightbot> If you are new to WoT, use these tips: 1. Dont rush tiers. 2. Dont use mods, especially XVM. 3. Stick to Russian heavies for a start to learn game better, sidescraping, angling etc. 4. Dont buy high tier premium tanks, until you play regular tanks in that tier. 5. Watch this stream to become better player, watch my positioning on the maps and listen to what i say because i explain what i'm doing B) . Watch Wargaming videos about game mechanics

[2022-12-20 09:21:11] <@^Nightbot> Broken tank, very well armored. Will be another hulldown tank with no weakspots. Very mobile too for the armor it has, a lot of gun depression, gun is good and accurate because good velocity on shells, bad standard pen. You mostly play it like a single shot tank so forget about the autoloader part. Overall a broken tank that adds more to the no weakspot hulldown meta.

[2022-12-20 09:23:18] <@^Nightbot> Totally broken tank, it makes Defender look like a baby.More lower plate armor than Minotauro and super small turret weakspot.Good penetration with both standard and gold, decent dmg capability, kinda slowish.If you care about the game don't buy this tank as it will ruin T6-T10 matchmaking.

Decent tank, very nice acceleration but no high top speed, nice turret armor, ok-ish gun handling, dispersion not very good on the move, decent pen with standard and gold, nice dmg potential, decent gun depression, mediocre moneymaker, average viewrange. Play it like a heavy using the turret, not so much flanking around and the lack of speed will not be a problem. Overall decent tank.

[2022-12-20 10:06:03] <useofweapons1> in game, whatever wg says, irl, it's  the mount in the turret and the clearance of the turret roof that dictate depression. unless were talking hydropneumatic suspension

On special days you can request a tank with 500 copper by typing !redeem tank followed by the tank name.

[2022-12-20 11:22:11] <@^Nightbot> If you are new to WoT, use these tips: 1. Dont rush tiers. 2. Dont use mods, especially XVM. 3. Stick to Russian heavies for a start to learn game better, sidescraping, angling etc. 4. Dont buy high tier premium tanks, until you play regular tanks in that tier. 5. Watch this stream to become better player, watch my positioning on the maps and listen to what i say because i explain what i'm doing B) . Watch Wargaming videos about game mechanics

[2022-12-20 12:27:40] <@^Nightbot> Broken tank, very well armored. Will be another hulldown tank with no weakspots. Very mobile too for the armor it has, a lot of gun depression, gun is good and accurate because good velocity on shells, bad standard pen. You mostly play it like a single shot tank so forget about the autoloader part. Overall a broken tank that adds more to the no weakspot hulldown meta.

[2022-12-20 12:29:46] <@^Nightbot> Good tank, decent mobility, very nice dispersion on the gun, can even shoot on the move, average pen with normal and gold, good gun depression, good dpm with both guns, higher dpm gun seems situational while bigger gun seems a better choice most of the time, not the easiest tank to play as you create weakspots when you use gun depression, ok-ish at sidescraping too and carefull when pointing the gun down as it reveals weakspots.Good tank but requires a higher skill cap to master it.
