[2023-01-04 14:57:30] <%ADelaney1991> I think Dan Burn could've played 900 minutes and still escaped a booking (had the fucker to be booked too obv)
[2023-01-04 14:57:33] <+bailey_mck01> Get ten hag a clinical striker and we could go on a run
[2023-01-04 14:57:35] <!d1_____________> newcastles bus were just too strong thats all it is. howie knew they had to do that to get anything from the game so fair play
[2023-01-04 14:57:35] <benriley20796> arsenal just didn't finish chances
[2023-01-04 14:57:37] <@%Zz_Bobi_zZ> @bompy98 cause the only loss came from liverpool in the that ridiculous extra time goal from carvalho
[2023-01-04 14:57:37] <rizzo_2000> what turns a good fifa player to a great one ? and what are some common mistakes that usually need fixing ?

[2023-01-04 14:58:09] <mxhxt> the fact we havent dropped 50mil on a striker shouldnt impact it
[2023-01-04 14:58:11] <!d1_____________> lets not talk about arsenal getting robbed of 2 pens
[2023-01-04 14:58:13] <!d1_____________> but if i speak
