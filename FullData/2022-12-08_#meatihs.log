[2022-12-08 20:27:19] <+Tinyfred> Yeah it's pretty much getting like 3 rune cards
[2022-12-08 20:27:22] <+Tinyfred> And it has no rune restrictions
[2022-12-08 20:27:25] <@%DerPeetz> @Tinyfred i played arena like for 6 runs now, didnt get offered DK once LUL
[2022-12-08 20:27:26] <ekalika> Woah! Meati- do you like the secret package more than concoctions? Is secret rogue fast enough?
[2022-12-08 20:27:32] <+Tinyfred> @DerPeetz Same I played 8 runs, no DK
[2022-12-08 20:27:39] <+Tinyfred> But then I always run against it
[2022-12-08 20:27:47] <@%DerPeetz> rigged DansGame @Tinyfred
[2022-12-08 20:27:48] <+Tinyfred> Anytime I get above 6-7 wins its just DKs
[2022-12-08 20:28:01] <@%DerPeetz> paladin goes fine for me
[2022-12-08 20:28:09] <%+ianrab> I got it first attempt and was 9-0 then lost 3 in a row to DK with better cards
[2022-12-08 20:28:26] <+Tinyfred> @DerPeetz Yeah I got 9 wins with a busted paladin deck
[2022-12-08 20:28:31] <%+ianrab> against any other class there was no competition

[2022-12-08 20:29:29] <+Tinyfred> I'm 4-2 with DH right now, but it's a bad deck
[2022-12-08 20:29:58] <@%DerPeetz> other classes (druid, shaman and i forgot what else) worked more like trashy and usually offered me the most basic cards...like going full chillwind yeti
[2022-12-08 20:30:00] <%ChrisIsError_> asmonWHAT
[2022-12-08 20:30:01] <+Tinyfred> If I get 5-6 wins I'll be happy. I just need gold to buy more rune XD
[2022-12-08 20:30:06] <+Tinyfred> I spent all my gold on card packs
[2022-12-08 20:30:13] <+Tinyfred> runs*
[2022-12-08 20:30:47] <@%DerPeetz> i always save my gold (usually around 9500g), get myself 55 packs, save 20 for the mini set and arena the last 2000g
[2022-12-08 20:31:16] <+Tinyfred> @DerPeetz Yeah smart, I was at 10K and bought 100 packs. I usually get 2000 by the time the mini set comes out

[2022-12-08 21:58:30] <@%tictac_hs> @Draftbeer Nah it's not gonna be full druid, people are slowly playing more and more aggro
[2022-12-08 21:58:40] <Fischerfischen> Is the shop closed for everyone else too or is it just me?
