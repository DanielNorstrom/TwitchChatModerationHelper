[2022-12-17 11:54:33] <@%^StreamElements>* I am a 45 year old lumberjack residing in the woods, chopping trees while living a humble and honest life. Unfortunately, this life is not sustainable anymore.. I decided to look for a job in the city and found out COVID is a thing. This can't be it.. that's impossible! I'm scared, terrified and unemployed. I resort to a life on the internet as a VTuber.. with a voice changer. Yes, it is fake. My entire life is a lie just like Chi.

[2022-12-17 18:23:13] <%MishaMerina> My one issue with the tales games is its one of the types of games that literally add more/better gear with higher difficulties but also gimp you on exp as a trade off.

[2022-12-17 18:25:55] <%senybonito> @kailaasa Vesperia is so good
[2022-12-17 18:26:05] <%MishaMerina> @kailaasa same but for me I really, REALLY should go back and finish Bersersia. I'm like RIGHT at the end
[2022-12-17 18:26:15] <%senybonito> I'm playing arise now and it's for sure different than vesperia

[2022-12-17 18:28:44] <%kailaasa> @senybonito I agree on Vesperia being good, always regret never finishing. And the big problem with Arise's story (imo) is that it's about as subtle as getting slapped in the face with a live dolphin
[2022-12-17 18:29:10] <%davecryo> stal can you check somehow if the lvl 10 thing worked ? stalalaLoading
[2022-12-17 18:29:21] <%MishaMerina> most of the tales games have pretty long narratives imo
[2022-12-17 18:29:24] <%senybonito> It's long yes KEKW
[2022-12-17 18:29:34] <%senybonito> Story is pretty good though they don't make you do fillers like arise does
[2022-12-17 18:29:57] <%senybonito> There's a narrative progression and it doesn't feel like there are bus stops like arise
[2022-12-17 18:29:59] <%kailaasa> Take it for what you will, but I finished Arise but not Vesperia as far as length goes heh. Might just be from the combat in Arise being nicer
[2022-12-17 18:30:01] <%MishaMerina> The Tales series in general sticks to the old rpg format of a game must be 60 hours or more

[2022-12-17 18:50:33] <+Dragoon790> It's not the current time. This is "standard time". The other one daylight savings time" is the one that will most likely be permanent. I hate the pointless changing of clocks every 6 months. It affects me more because I work the night shift. The change happens right at my regular lunch time.
[2022-12-17 18:51:06] <%valfayr> for many jobs it makes sense
[2022-12-17 18:51:16] <%valfayr> but is was made in an energy crisis
[2022-12-17 18:51:20] <%valfayr> to save oil etc
[2022-12-17 18:51:22] <+Dragoon790> It's to try keeping sun rise around the same time frame.
[2022-12-17 18:51:22] <%MishaMerina> I dare ask Stal but do you do anything on the tiktok? Content creator friends of mine have been talking a lot about how apparently TikTok has been poppin off for them.
