[2023-01-08 13:30:31] <%celticprince127> @rdulive then don't use taunt spellcraft. dog dog found out that if u spellcraft something with a natural ability sufk as taunt, wi5h the corresponding epellcraft, it loses it. he found it out by saying fk it and shielding a pup bot which lost shield when his next turn started
[2023-01-08 13:30:34] <%+looplessly> Double taunt would be too strong without removing fort, and fort is a fun mechanic

[2023-01-08 13:31:38] <%celticprince127> @rdulive so if u use tier 2 taunt spellcraft on something with taunt, the next turn it perma loses it
[2023-01-08 13:31:59] <+NGTRXO> Yeah this hero is so poorly designed, its basically every 3 turns discover a minion from your tavern tier
[2023-01-08 13:32:09] <%celticprince127> @rdulive yes it was done by dogdog
[2023-01-08 13:32:16] <%VerisMaeshu> golden gold grubber sounds much better GGG

[2023-01-08 13:34:50] <l_d_ablo> @the_homestarmy true. the only time you use the other 2 is when you don't have 3 turns left, and by then, +2 attack is useless. (side note, down here at 7k I've seen the 5 turn one used from time to time.)

[2023-01-08 13:49:56] <djsens3> kripp is 6 k mmr
[2023-01-08 13:49:57] <@%R2DU> HmmmG Kripp is only 7k mmr but he is far ahead of Rdu in critical thinking and analyzing the playing field, Kripp is always 5 steps ahead and is allready considering what minions to buy in tavern tier 6 while only at turn 2. wheras Rdu is only looking at the battlefield in front of him. i firmly believe Rdu should leave his bg carreer and focus on his cooking. HmmmG

[2023-01-08 14:23:16] <@%R2DU> First, there was a big guy in the sky who called himself Jerry, he decided to create a creature, the first man, named him “the Man of Jerry”, years later the man of jerry was trying to save Bran Stark from zombies, he started yelling over and over “man of jerry, man of jerry, manoojerry, MENAJERRY, MENAJERRY.” that day the legend of Menajerry was born. he is the grand grand father of Rdu.
