[2022-12-10 13:25:24] <+iimAbyss> Big ball of sticks that rolls around like you see in western films
[2022-12-10 13:25:47] <+iimAbyss> clips going around of people looking at them and it crashes their dungeon run
[2022-12-10 13:25:55] <RyanEveleigh> Already watch for maewu and woosa video, was pretty hype xF
[2022-12-10 13:26:37] <+iimAbyss> I think its hilarious but also could see how it can be frustrating too

[2022-12-10 13:34:23] <ShieldBDO> Wtf don’t say that. I just started Padix this week and I’ve been going 10hrs a day there. Hate the spot so much goddamn
[2022-12-10 13:34:39] <@%Sh0ckie> wondering if your magic number will be 320h cause of hystria with 3200
[2022-12-10 13:35:12] <ShieldBDO> It’s been so depressing there. Around 420m/h
[2022-12-10 13:35:37] <ShieldBDO> Just blue ls with max drop rate event
[2022-12-10 13:35:48] <ShieldBDO> Haven’t used agris at all

[2022-12-10 13:37:33] <ShieldBDO> Yeah I might use agris as well. I have been logging in and out in padix since drop rate event NotLikeThis

[2022-12-10 13:40:03] <cuddling659> What is your tag character?
[2022-12-10 13:40:32] <ShieldBDO> Stars end is such an rng grind it’s not worth. Might as well get 800m consistently at orcs
[2022-12-10 13:40:52] <ShieldBDO> I’ve gone 7 hrs straight at SE without drops and never been back since NotLikeThis
[2022-12-10 13:41:02] <+iimAbyss> I grind stars because my gear is dogshit and I am tapping my disto drops because I still need distos
[2022-12-10 13:41:37] <ShieldBDO> Yeah I guess for streaming it’s tough to grind Arsha. Whenever I’m online Arsha padix is just completely empty
[2022-12-10 13:41:42] <@%Sh0ckie> kinda sad, cause of the higher rates now about arsha
[2022-12-10 13:41:50] <ShieldBDO> Go centaurs if low gear @iimabyss

[2022-12-10 13:43:03] <+iimAbyss> Im 280/345 so I could do orcs but like the gamblers fallacy is strong
