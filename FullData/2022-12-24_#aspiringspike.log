[2022-12-24 17:52:49] <hambono> technically
[2022-12-24 17:52:49] <phrogamid> powered by fun :)
[2022-12-24 17:52:50] <+TheAnnhialatrix> people like the lower power level

[2022-12-24 17:52:54] <+pkpzt212> does Oracle of the alpha count?
[2022-12-24 17:52:54] <%SquidSquaaad> Its got the Alchemy Power Bird
[2022-12-24 17:52:54] <%Bassnj> its basically historic banlist
[2022-12-24 17:52:54] <+Vivitgray> Arena cube is fun
[2022-12-24 17:52:54] <%+kentuckyfri3d> vintage cube is so much enjoyable
[2022-12-24 17:52:54] <symphon50> Sort of? There's an alchemy card that puts power in your deck
[2022-12-24 17:52:57] <koitoskauno> Powered by spite
[2022-12-24 17:52:57] <theallpowerfuldaniel> Arena cube is good
[2022-12-24 17:52:58] <%+lanternofinsight> I played a few, feels VERY play/draw dependant
[2022-12-24 17:52:59] <+TheAnnhialatrix> it has alchemy
[2022-12-24 17:52:59] <%$ajd5995> It has Oracle of the alpha
[2022-12-24 17:52:59] <+Silver__Core> its got the historic card that has the power under it
[2022-12-24 17:53:00] <hambono> you can oracle of the alpha
[2022-12-24 17:53:06] <wavelink17> Both cubes are good, Oracle of the Alpha is a treat
[2022-12-24 17:53:08] <Tentacoo1> its powered by Oracle

[2022-12-24 17:53:19] <qzzyozzy> arena cube is interesting but vintage cube is better imo
[2022-12-24 17:53:20] <%AutkastKain> it's good
[2022-12-24 17:53:21] <+VentusTPD> It‚Äôs actually not good though
[2022-12-24 17:53:25] <symphon50> The blink oracle deck in cube is top tier
[2022-12-24 17:53:25] <+TheAnnhialatrix> displacer kitten plus oracle is real fun in arena

[2022-12-24 17:53:30] <wavelink17> @aspiringspike Displacer Kitten + Oracle is basically twin
[2022-12-24 17:53:32] <hambono> NumotTheNummy forces it all the time lol
[2022-12-24 17:53:36] <%AutkastKain> if you build around it can be good
[2022-12-24 17:53:36] <yolando115> I had an opponent keep from killing out due to that card
[2022-12-24 17:53:38] <phrogamid> regarding that card, has it ever been referred to as 'the power 9' by wotc before this?
[2022-12-24 17:53:42] <%$ajd5995> It‚Äôs definitely fun
[2022-12-24 17:53:43] <thedjangler> its very good in the right shell
[2022-12-24 17:53:47] <D4rkdwarf> I played vs mono red 4 times in a row and gave up on the format
[2022-12-24 17:53:53] <+TheAnnhialatrix> you can go infinite
[2022-12-24 17:53:55] <DanroMTG> @aspiringspike in cube it makes 1/4th of your deck power
[2022-12-24 17:54:05] <+Swivle_> I like how the first2 replies were "it's so good" and "it's not good" lol
[2022-12-24 17:54:08] <%Musteval> in limited youre not always thrilled to draw a mox on turn 7
[2022-12-24 17:54:11] <%jace_meister> its pretty dumb in constructed as well
[2022-12-24 17:54:16] <%Goody_Phil> in your 40 card slow limited format
[2022-12-24 17:54:24] <+TheAnnhialatrix> it says power nine on the card
[2022-12-24 17:54:26] <mburke005> 17 lands rates it pretty highly actually for blue stuf, its like +7iwd and 56% wr gih
[2022-12-24 17:54:27] <symphon50> Plus you could buy retro art oracle which gives you retro art power
[2022-12-24 17:54:27] <phrogamid> oh yeah, i was just curious
[2022-12-24 17:54:36] <+Gimmlixx> i dont think its better in limited. it basically puts 5 more lands in your limited deck mid game

[2022-12-24 17:54:59] <qzzyozzy> oracle is great when you draw timetwister, black lotus or ancestral but the moxen kinda suck to draw on like turn 3-5
[2022-12-24 17:55:07] <wavelink17> Weird that WOTC hasn't added Jade Avenger to the power 9
[2022-12-24 17:55:18] <Vernash_> @aspiringspike we build around playing from top of library or alternatively fetching and recurring timewalk in 60 card versions, problem is mostly not dieing to monored in constructed formats

[2022-12-24 18:20:04] <@%^MTGBot> Orvar is for the Archon of Cruelty decks. When the opposing Archon enters the battlefield, you discard Orvar to it, it enters as a copy of Archon, and they have to sac their Archon to your trigger.

[2022-12-24 18:42:26] <deeerell> i just undo all my losing lines

[2022-12-24 19:00:31] <@%phuckingmagikal> Yes, releasing information before it is supposed to be released due to NDA's or other clauses means it is against the law to release that information, hence, leak. The card being found in a pack is a way Wizards has released information before, thus, it is a spoiler. Not a leak. This topic is something much bigger than just MTG

[2022-12-24 19:11:59] <@%^MTGBot> Saga is an enchantment type introduced in Dominaria. Each Saga tells the story of a key event from the past as it unfolds during each of your turns. Each... See Saga: https://mtg.fandom.com/wiki/Saga
[2022-12-24 19:12:16] <%SkullclampMTG> Thanks for the reasoning on rag spike, this was educational
[2022-12-24 19:12:22] <blaghenniy> @ornatepuzzles thank you
[2022-12-24 19:12:24] <@%^MTGBot> The League Match has started! aspiringspike (1-1) is currently playing mi89325 (0-0).
[2022-12-24 19:12:24] <HoopyFreud> 715.4. If the number of lore counters on a Saga permanent is greater than or equal to its final chapter number, and it isn‚Äôt the source of a chapter ability that has triggered but not yet left the stack, that Saga‚Äôs controller sacrifices it. This state-based action doesn‚Äôt use the stack.
[2022-12-24 19:12:30] <+migmedic> Magic is such a variance game. You can be the best player on earth and sometimes op runs so hot there‚Äôs nothing to be done.
[2022-12-24 19:12:30] <%Goody_Phil> Saga with no chapters means any amount of chapter number tokens are the max for the saga, so it sacrifices itself
[2022-12-24 19:12:48] <Istamii> sick hand

[2022-12-24 19:13:26] <rThundrbolt> 715.4 explains both the urza's saga things that people like to argue over: blood moon and power conduit
[2022-12-24 19:13:38] <HoopyFreud> that's extremely weird templating on the rules
[2022-12-24 19:13:50] <HoopyFreud> they *had* to be talking it into account when they wrote it
[2022-12-24 19:13:55] <ryagami7> o
[2022-12-24 19:13:59] <+pkpzt212> @aspiringspike fwiw, it was in the release notes for the card
[2022-12-24 19:14:06] <jamjarrs> @blaghenniy Blood Moon removes the land subtypes and abilities from Urza's Saga but doesn't remove enchantment subtypes, so it's a saga with 0 chapters so it dies due to that rule 715.4
[2022-12-24 19:14:11] <%Goody_Phil> have luck have fun
[2022-12-24 19:14:20] <%SkullclampMTG> High risk high reward
[2022-12-24 19:14:28] <HoopyFreud> it's a state-based effect that *doesn't* work as long as the chapter ability is on the stack
[2022-12-24 19:14:32] <HoopyFreud> so very very odd
[2022-12-24 19:14:37] <Gincola> opp is off the wagon

[2022-12-24 19:30:10] <%Aquinas9> Geez, no one in this pool playing Green?
[2022-12-24 19:30:10] <TimePhase> cmon academy
[2022-12-24 19:30:20] <%Aquinas9> Green is amazing in Vintage Cube. Love me some mono green.

[2022-12-24 19:30:49] <%Aquinas9> I like Urza here
[2022-12-24 19:30:57] <%SquidSquaaad> No green deck in the pod, ugin may wheel
[2022-12-24 19:30:58] <+majoras35> @Draken44 rarely does
[2022-12-24 19:31:09] <mrfringe89> @aspiringspike did we get a free draft for the holidays?
[2022-12-24 19:31:20] <+fivebrane> upheaval is the best hit possible
[2022-12-24 19:31:21] <%iceman012> Just take 2 cards and hope nobody notices
[2022-12-24 19:31:22] <Morderent> just activating urza is good in this deck

[2022-12-24 19:31:27] <%Aquinas9> This is very hard. Upheaval and timetwister are so good in this deck.

[2022-12-24 19:32:22] <ornatepuzzles> what I find funny about GEA is that many people (myself too sometimes) just call her Glen - as if its her first name
[2022-12-24 19:32:22] <KunaOona> I wonder how many lands we gonna end up playing
[2022-12-24 19:32:27] <omgthoseguys> how many players/rounds in this cube format?
[2022-12-24 19:32:36] <vengevine20> I was said cause the person mantaining it I‚Äôd being changed.

[2022-12-24 19:35:31] <KunaOona> Not like our spells cost colored mana
[2022-12-24 19:35:34] <%Aquinas9> Put Golgari Signet back in
[2022-12-24 19:35:34] <%+kentuckyfri3d> green blue is good
[2022-12-24 19:35:36] <Morderent> this deck is nice
[2022-12-24 19:35:49] <%antongrimes> multicolor better for golos
[2022-12-24 19:35:52] <%haunter_hunter> do you have black sources for wishclaw?
[2022-12-24 19:35:56] <%Aquinas9> Bring in Glen
[2022-12-24 19:35:56] <IAmTheSamsquanch> Golgari signet for golos
[2022-12-24 19:35:56] <+ferrandynamo> do you play all you signets for golos?
[2022-12-24 19:36:04] <%Bassnj> glen
[2022-12-24 19:36:13] <bertoron> Can we play show and tell with big boys?
[2022-12-24 19:36:18] <KunaOona> I‚Äôd consider w6
[2022-12-24 19:36:20] <Ross_Merriam> Wishclaw Talisman is great with Upheaval.
[2022-12-24 19:36:20] <+daveb_> cut crucible
[2022-12-24 19:36:25] <%antongrimes> s&t blightsteel is terrible

[2022-12-24 19:36:27] <%iceman012> Is crucible worth it when they only benefit is smokestack?
[2022-12-24 19:36:29] <monarchlord> high tide and blightsteel?
[2022-12-24 19:36:29] <Morderent> golos can also fix for the goblin
[2022-12-24 19:36:31] <+ferrandynamo> does leveler say cast from hand?
[2022-12-24 19:36:38] <+ferrandynamo> cause I like desire if it doesn't
[2022-12-24 19:36:40] <%Aquinas9> @bertoron Show & Tell is insanely dangerous in Vintage Cube unless you are sure you are holding the best card. Folks are out here with Emrakul and Griselbrand.
[2022-12-24 19:36:41] <rowrow_> just cast
[2022-12-24 19:36:41] <vengevine20> Talisman is good with upheaval spike

[2022-12-24 19:37:08] <Ross_Merriam> Maybe play the G cards?
[2022-12-24 19:37:08] <+gitstache> I like glen, it‚Äôs fine interaction
[2022-12-24 19:37:09] <devprime1> you can cheat blightsteel with show and tell

[2022-12-24 19:37:27] <+ferrandynamo> triome and uro seems okay
[2022-12-24 19:37:29] <%antongrimes> s&t blightsteel is awful chat
[2022-12-24 19:37:33] <rowrow_> we're likely never activating golos
[2022-12-24 19:37:36] <rowrow_> without signets
[2022-12-24 19:37:40] <%SkullclampMTG> Show and tell the titan and blightsteel not bad
[2022-12-24 19:37:40] <rowrow_> so lands don't fix that
[2022-12-24 19:37:44] <Nadu6> how about Tendrails?
[2022-12-24 19:37:45] <+doodleman_212> Spinning Golos is gonna be a chore
[2022-12-24 19:37:47] <%LensBlair> show and tell big bois?
[2022-12-24 19:37:47] <ryagami7> fastbond?
[2022-12-24 19:37:49] <%+kentuckyfri3d> noble hierach?
[2022-12-24 19:37:58] <%Aquinas9> I don't think we are ever escaping Uro. That card is just 3 mana for growth spiral / healing salve.
[2022-12-24 19:38:12] <devprime1> if you splash for uro might as well put in fastbond
[2022-12-24 19:38:17] <%antongrimes> triome is an underground sea
[2022-12-24 19:38:19] <ba340201> show and tell with titan and blightsteel
[2022-12-24 19:38:27] <%Aquinas9> Not a fan of Mind's Desire here. I can't see us getting a big storm count.
[2022-12-24 19:38:32] <sambooch> Can our mana activate golos?
[2022-12-24 19:38:37] <%Aquinas9> I would play Glen over Mind's Desire.
[2022-12-24 19:38:45] <+macielneto> Why not play te colossus just for science?
[2022-12-24 19:38:47] <KunaOona> Feels like way too many lands/mana sources
[2022-12-24 19:38:47] <Drow29Hunter95> 17 lands because of diamond?

[2022-12-24 19:38:58] <jasperlion> Triome plus fastbond for upheaval
[2022-12-24 19:39:04] <+MTGSoulStrong> play high tide and glen and be mono blue

[2022-12-24 19:39:37] <rowrow_> high tide also a lot worse with turnabout removed

[2022-12-24 19:40:18] <bnrstnkr> they need to fix the cube if cutting cards for bugs then address the cards they synergize with

Revoker can never do that and OP can respond to Spellbinder trigger by bolting the Spellbinder. Peackeeper has some applications, including locking down activated abilities from Grindstone, Urza's Saga, and fetch lands.

[2022-12-24 20:54:34] <lahdoja> In modern, it's not like there aren't good ways to power out three drops, they just either fold to removal, like mana dorks, or dont work with each other, such as moonsnare prototype, springleaf drum and utopia sprawl. I guess that's the problem wth 3 drops in modern.
