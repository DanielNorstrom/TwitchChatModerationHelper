[2023-01-08 11:53:58] <ReptileHand> I was not the way I am socially 20 years ago. It took a lot of socializing, especially in college and then online over the past 10 years thanks to party chats and then eventually discord and twitch communities.
[2023-01-08 11:54:18] <$dreamdemon1197> I want to become a twitch streamer to distract myself from my anxiety but I kinda worry about it.
