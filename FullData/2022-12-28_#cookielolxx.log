[2022-12-28 17:32:02] <+damiancrr> it's complaining if you blame the lost lane on it

[2022-12-28 17:32:11] <%+Keym_99> Lux E has to be OP otherwise she is useless because the Rest of her kit is very underloaded @CookieLoLxx
[2022-12-28 17:32:13] <lilpoonzie> the difference is that you’re not raging
[2022-12-28 17:32:15] <itakashiraiya> i think the E is too hard to dodge, if not for that I think she'd be balanced
[2022-12-28 17:32:17] <Atelophobie> how would that be a complaint
[2022-12-28 17:32:18] <+mathias_221> a complain is a statement that something is unsatisfactory or unacceptable according to google
[2022-12-28 17:32:19] <+hluvhihi> I mean you can complain with a fact, it’s just a way of expressing
[2022-12-28 17:32:29] <%+GoW0n> @MeGudMyTeamXD ah didnt know it was that insane of a difference. In my country a sub is 6.44 usd a month

[2022-12-28 18:48:46] <@%T1mbits> lmao i dont think many people have plans for ranked
[2022-12-28 18:48:47] <nome_daora_> is samira good in this meta? bc eu actually find her kinda shitty rn
[2022-12-28 18:48:49] <removedenterkey> Ranked usually starts in February doesn't it?
[2022-12-28 18:48:50] <depreciatedasset> Jan 6? Kkona

[2022-12-28 18:49:11] <itsArsum> At what point is coaching worth it if I just started the game like a few weeks ago chat

[2022-12-28 18:49:49] <%+cyotaffer> @itsArsum get to high silver and then coaching is worth it
[2022-12-28 18:49:53] <Tarzannd> ITS 4TH @kibu7realm stop typing nonsense
[2022-12-28 18:50:00] <midbeastfangirl1> @itsarsum if you are stuck after months of playing, following YouTube guides and watching your own vods
[2022-12-28 18:50:03] <usama_asif> @removedenterkey nah it's early January always before the league's start
[2022-12-28 18:50:03] <%vkg_cabrito> 4th is wednesday so yea
[2022-12-28 18:50:08] <+Scientrist> @navtlol It's really not worth to get coaching until high diamond IMO

[2022-12-28 18:50:20] <%vkg_cabrito> cuz they never release a patch on friday
[2022-12-28 18:50:24] <%777raw777> @itsArsum if you arent master + coaching is a waste of time, with only watching the stream u can get master guranteed

[2022-12-28 18:50:39] <%+ezraek> @Scientrist You should get coaching once you're no longer able to identify your mistakes.
[2022-12-28 18:50:41] <%777raw777> caaaaaaaaaaaper
[2022-12-28 18:50:45] <chickg_> when do you go this new build

[2022-12-28 18:50:51] <midbeastfangirl1> @777raw777 with that logic there would be 100k+ master players. not everyone can learn like that.

[2022-12-28 18:51:15] <%vkg_cabrito> is it actually good to wait to play ranked at the beginning of the year cuz of the matchmaking?
[2022-12-28 18:51:17] <mrrobot122123> grind from silver to master or on your main account ?

[2022-12-28 18:51:22] <midbeastfangirl1> many people who are stuck in bronze or silver get higher elo by getting a coach cause learning alone is quite different than someone telling you what to do

[2022-12-28 18:51:27] <%vkg_cabrito> like to not get higher elo players or lower

[2022-12-28 19:07:41] <imerv1> Starting the thumbnails up during NNN was a bold move

[2022-12-28 19:08:02] <shokenqq> @cookielolxx i think it's good now but after some time ppl will be annoyed, maybe after kike 1 year, i dunno maybe im wrong haha
[2022-12-28 19:08:04] <sahoyap> I dont think the hate is about being bad thumbnails? they are really well made, i think its just the weird coomer theme? or am i wrong? xD
