[2022-12-29 21:43:52] <yuriokyizu_> Raidens pretty f2p her weapon is where u kinda gotta work for though
[2022-12-29 21:43:54] <yanfeiclient> @greenpotatothatdraws depends on the person man perhaps they think that she isnt f2p friendly bc she cannot nuke for 500k at c0
[2022-12-29 21:44:01] <%+afternooncellica> I love raiden, she is quite easy to use with alot of dmg even at C0
