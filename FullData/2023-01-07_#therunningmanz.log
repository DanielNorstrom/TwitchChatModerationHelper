[2023-01-07 13:51:38] <XXL_KALEB_H00PER> Ahh ok ya I can see why that’s a bad bug thnx for clarifying!!!
[2023-01-07 13:52:00] <xprodestro> Just looked it up, it takes 5-6 grenades to destroy a wall. It used to be 10. They probbaly updated it in the last year to make base raiding a little easier
[2023-01-07 13:52:20] <%$itsmeobee> @cyprussphil hey fair enough, it takes some use too for sure, i love it now tho, i find sniping much better on mouse trmzWorthitmanz
[2023-01-07 13:52:22] <lampedaire> hello
[2023-01-07 13:52:34] <%+telf72> I get that on console too. Makes stealth kills almost impossible too.
[2023-01-07 13:52:36] <%+galasteve> It’s really bad after crouching.   So if u crouch, when u get up, just click ADS to try and get it back to normal.
[2023-01-07 13:52:37] <%+mikeGzY83> @TheRunningManZ do you have a favorite map?
[2023-01-07 13:52:44] <%impipapo> Is it the games or the servers fault? Because if it does have to do with server desynchronisation wouldn’t that mean we just need to get “better” servers? trmzBigbrain

[2023-01-07 13:56:01] <+peg4sus80> gun on first level or radio tower?
[2023-01-07 13:56:03] <@%+XMugshotX> spring on Namalsk kinda defeats the purpose of the map
[2023-01-07 13:56:06] <@%^Nightbot> TRMZ releases a new video every week on YT, you can go and see highlights of his adventures here: youtube.com/therunningmanz
[2023-01-07 13:56:06] <EveningOfficer_> Edited YT videos coming back soon? I like your unedited stuff, but I like the edited action videos/movies even more. Lol
[2023-01-07 13:56:43] <%+galasteve> Namalsk with spring weather will just be too easy to run south.  I don’t think the balance will be there.   It’ll look amazing, and it’ll suit some folks.  But to me, I don’t think it’ll have the longevity of the winter version
[2023-01-07 13:56:47] <+HiredSapper> hey Big man
[2023-01-07 13:56:50] <Tueniuan> @galasteve what i've meant was that the devs might stop working on DayZ if they're gonna do/release something like DayZ 2
[2023-01-07 13:56:52] <%impipapo> @xprodestro I totally agree! Really hope they will rework the NEAF in the future as well. Would be great to have some more buildings there as well!

[2023-01-07 13:58:24] <%+galasteve> @tueniuan potentially, yeah. I think that they’re working on arma 4, which will be the basis for DayZ 2, if it ever comes.   I don’t livonia will ever be changed drastically to what it is just now tho.  Wee bits here and there may change, but essentially it’ll be what it is now.  Just my opinion tho
[2023-01-07 13:58:24] <MY5TIC_STYLES> takastan gives me arma 2  vibes

[2023-01-07 14:03:03] <%impipapo> @xprodestro I agree! I hope it’s much smaller tho. Atm you don’t need to search the south barracks that much because it spawns terrible loot (arma 3 barracks). I hope for some more woods around it tbh, or maybe a bunker deep in the woods
[2023-01-07 14:03:03] <%redlazermod> cheers buddy much love to the DayZ community

[2023-01-07 14:03:11] <%the_dailynomad> hey man whats up?? i have the virus sign on this character i have now, bit no cough no blurry vision nothing that shows i am sick. already finished a box of 8 vitamins and another box of like 4 tetra pills, but I still have the sign. is it a bug?? even after logging off/on its still showing and even after server restart.
[2023-01-07 14:03:17] <Razerer92> @TheRunningManZ thanks but i dont think its a cold because my character doesnt sneeze, and when i get the virus sign my character gets dehydrated fast (2 down arrows even when i stand still) is it really a cold?
[2023-01-07 14:03:33] <%00mehmet7> that game looks like a scam i hope not tho

[2023-01-07 14:52:04] <%+volksrat> @therunningmanz  something seems wrong with the Prime subscription at the moment.
[2023-01-07 14:52:07] <$Code_Man_83> The eye can only perceive so many FPS, theres a point where its pointless
[2023-01-07 14:52:10] <@%Acidfreaker> @xechoooo dont think more then 160hz is pointless. you'll only rly notice if you ever change back
[2023-01-07 14:52:12] <Josman1337> i might die in your arms tonight
[2023-01-07 14:52:23] <+JustDrunken> or you could go higher fidelity. 4k 144hz monitor

[2023-01-07 14:52:52] <@%Acidfreaker> @justdrunken definitely better to go higher res at that point indeed
[2023-01-07 14:52:53] <drnoob80> I know nobody asked but to everyone complaining about ads.

Then there was 1 billion people on earth and 85% in famine. Now we are with 8 billion people on earth and only 15% in famine.

[2023-01-07 16:38:05] <Kobasiburek> The Day Before is the most wishlisted game on Steam, that alone will be its downfall. These games are niche and people are expecting that one to be some godsend. The devs are shooting themselves in the foot marketing it the way they are. A lot of the footage they showed looks boring and linear. Also I agree it'll either get delayed again or be a botched release, but time will tell

[2023-01-07 18:10:20] <%RedeyeSr> Considering how much easier to aim with mouse, why would console owners want crossplay?
[2023-01-07 18:10:21] <%spalmann> off topic but why most streamers prefer to snipe from crouched rather than prone? does the lower starting point effect the ranging?

[2023-01-07 18:31:12] <@%^Nightbot> Take time exploring the map, don't worry about getting all the loots. Follow roads or power lines to towns, find a road sign with a towns name and use an external map to navigate with !maps. Stay warm and dry! Zombies often have food, drinks and tools on them. If you aren't finding loot in a town someone might have just been through it, move on to the next town. Always remember that gear comes and goes, everyone dies, and to Have Fun!

[2023-01-07 18:44:31] <yankees1jr> No, in the US you can have an 18+ year old take you if you’re underage
[2023-01-07 18:44:33] <%pixelspartan39> I walked into a IMAX theater at the age of I believe 12 and watched a horror movie. Guy didn't care only because it was a date
[2023-01-07 18:44:35] <321boop> i got served at a pub in Bath when i was 17
[2023-01-07 18:44:35] <%shanebluesky> U can see a “18” rated film in US if your parents are with u
[2023-01-07 18:44:40] <%+latharda> us has G, PG, PG-13, R NC-17
[2023-01-07 18:44:44] <PlaceboPlaceBro> with parents in US you can go to R

[2023-01-07 18:44:51] <yankees1jr> I know bc my friend’s mom took us to see an R-rated movie years ago
[2023-01-07 18:44:56] <%+irishman4200> 17 us
[2023-01-07 18:45:02] <granal88> its only nc-17 that kids arent allowed to see in america
[2023-01-07 18:45:02] <%+sweet_bro> back in the 90s my friend won some tickets to an R rated movie via the radio. They let 4 x 10 year olds go in alone and watch LUL
[2023-01-07 18:45:02] <fanpsx> US is 21+ right?
[2023-01-07 18:45:10] <+RAM1313> 14 beer is ok ;)
[2023-01-07 18:45:18] <PeRveY_SagE> Don't think cinemas will be around for too much longer anyway. unless they make it a super experiance.
[2023-01-07 18:45:19] <%+spider1man360> Green hell is a Good survival game lol
[2023-01-07 18:45:21] <ReactorofR> The rating system in the US isn't actually backed by the goverment it's just something the movie industry did to avoid further legistlation, so cinemas don't have to enforce it any way
[2023-01-07 18:45:23] <1776energons> megan should not be rated pg. not to long ago that would have been an r movie

[2023-01-07 18:45:28] <+DoubleclickEB> Edgar wright
[2023-01-07 18:45:29] <Bambo_oZlr> Edgar Wright
[2023-01-07 18:45:31] <%DoinWork369> in the US its PG-13 which is parental guidance up to age of 13 and rated R which you have to be 18+
[2023-01-07 18:45:34] <%shanebluesky> Also u can get away with buying a PG or kids film and just sauntering into an R or adult film…
[2023-01-07 18:45:37] <TrainspottingTrev> 21 to drink in the US is a joke
[2023-01-07 18:45:39] <+saxman323> But a child can’t get in to a nc-17 film even with a parent - I remember when showgirls came out - that was a thing
[2023-01-07 18:45:39] <+Jchaplin2> Edgar Wright? yea he did Hot Fuzz

[2023-01-07 18:45:42] <%pixelspartan39> welp, I was watching horror films at 12 in films by myself that were rated PG 13
[2023-01-07 18:45:42] <yankees1jr> We have a Mature rating or whatever it’s called where you have to be over 18 I believe
[2023-01-07 18:45:45] <+PartiallyInfinite> Some US states allow kids to drink if they're with an adult
[2023-01-07 18:45:45] <oophenomoo> rifle in that store

[2023-01-07 18:46:28] <@%PJ_LTW> If all the remakes Running Man is a great one as it’s very dated but a great premise
[2023-01-07 18:46:29] <+BobbyFrickinGold> When I was a kid (8 years old) my aunt took me to see Purple Rain in the theaters. It was definitely rated R.

[2023-01-07 19:18:54] <+saxman323> Why is it always so dark on vanilla servers?  And why are there so many barred / locked doors in the towns? Are those bases?

[2023-01-07 19:24:04] <%+galasteve> @adzz177 no.  Probably tier 2

[2023-01-07 19:24:58] <%+galasteve> @adzz177 but yes - as @lupinthereturn said - it’s amongst the best snipers in the game .  But it is a relatively low tier loot
[2023-01-07 19:25:11] <%+BobithanTG> So is the mosin better than the tundra

[2023-01-07 19:25:34] <yankees1jr> There was one in a barn a little bit back too I believe
[2023-01-07 19:25:35] <%$DBearIt> I been enjoying the blaze lately
[2023-01-07 19:25:38] <King_James_777> @BobithanTG I feel its whatever scope you like imo
[2023-01-07 19:25:44] <%+Beetlewins> You always need a potato
[2023-01-07 19:25:47] <%+galasteve> @sirjimiee nope.  I don’t think it’s OP.
[2023-01-07 19:25:50] <%+bigeye1978> thats where all the 308s are at  bases
[2023-01-07 19:25:53] <dr__green__> like 5th base on this run
[2023-01-07 19:25:57] <%pixelspartan39> @galasteve yep, I've gotten more kills with it then any other sniper
[2023-01-07 19:25:57] <+lupinthereturn> @galasteve yep, basically. the other one on par is the tundra if i'm not mistaken
[2023-01-07 19:26:00] <+TacoConch> @SirJimiee I think it's pretty balanced because of the shorter range scope.
[2023-01-07 19:26:00] <+Liquid_Courage_> @pixelspartan39 Really? What's makes you say that? CR for me is only better than the New 5.45 Sniper..

[2023-01-07 19:26:39] <%ZackMcCracken77> BINGO
[2023-01-07 19:26:41] <%+galasteve> @lupinthereturn yeah - single shot wise.   Loads of considerations to take into account with them all.   The blaze double shot is supposedly the strongest.
