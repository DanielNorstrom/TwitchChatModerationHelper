[2022-12-09 15:34:21] <Tareah> @kristooff me either .. all the other streamers i get the banner saying the streamer has drops turned on
[2022-12-09 15:34:25] <sk8rbunn> Go to your Dashboard settings. From there, click on Viewer Rewards and then Drops to change your opt-out preference. You can also quickly toggle Drops on/off through a quick action on your dashboard. Note that to completely opt-out of Drops, you must unlink your Twitch and game developer accounts, as described above.
[2022-12-09 15:34:26] <Tareah> we get a banner if you have it on
[2022-12-09 15:34:28] <@%sigilfish> yeah, theres no banner

[2022-12-09 17:09:35] <+bobd0b> I'd suggest not doing anything until you know if any of it will be relevant next week
[2022-12-09 17:09:39] <Speshulist> I know there's a finite amount of points and you cannot reset them
[2022-12-09 17:09:40] <Duxliberty> imo shit just like chest/legs are good
[2022-12-09 17:09:44] <+barskebaard> you gain recipes based on what specialization you choose

[2022-12-09 17:10:17] <Sawfty_> I'm finishing out Weaponsmithing in BS. I highly recommend getting at least some points in each to get the weapon recipes.

[2022-12-09 17:10:46] <@%sigilfish> @FlashX999 it takes awhile until market becomes stabile again, its always like this. after raid and m+ comes out, it will be way clearer.
[2022-12-09 17:10:55] <+TirnaJo> can you have more than 1 specialisation
[2022-12-09 17:10:57] <Sawfty_> Good choice.
[2022-12-09 17:11:01] <Sawfty_> Yes, eventually you can
[2022-12-09 17:11:04] <+barskebaard> i went 10/30 weaponsmithing -> 30/30 blades first.
[2022-12-09 17:11:06] <Sawfty_> But, it takes time.
[2022-12-09 17:11:10] <@%sigilfish> yeah
[2022-12-09 17:11:15] <+TirnaJo> ah ok

[2022-12-09 17:11:42] <Sawfty_> 5 knowledge at a time to get the reward, you want 10 in the main item
[2022-12-09 17:11:45] <+barskebaard> to gain another sub specialization
[2022-12-09 17:11:54] <Sawfty_> Then you can do the side blades or maces
[2022-12-09 17:12:07] <Speshulist> Once you get done, there are world 1-time use knowledge points you can grab
[2022-12-09 17:12:16] <Sawfty_> It isn't because you'll eventually want them all Sco.
[2022-12-09 17:12:19] <Juvection> Go get all the BS treasures

[2022-12-09 17:12:45] <Sawfty_> You get that from crafting a new item, from finding the BS treasures, and from the secret trainer.
