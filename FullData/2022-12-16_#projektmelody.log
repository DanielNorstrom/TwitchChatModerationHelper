[2022-12-16 23:31:02] <Kagumiiin> not the reason no
[2022-12-16 23:31:09] <Kagumiiin> I enjoyed the community aspect of it backwhen everyone around me played
[2022-12-16 23:31:20] <@%Mikulex> apriSadge
[2022-12-16 23:31:24] <Kagumiiin> now it's just me and I don't have a reasn to grind for 2k

[2022-12-16 23:32:11] <@%Mikulex> I c
[2022-12-16 23:32:51] <Kagumiiin> also that I couldn't really play with anyone around me anymore because of rating diff
[2022-12-16 23:34:22] <Kagumiiin> I want to get back to it at some point though
[2022-12-16 23:34:45] <@%Mikulex> I do be interested in chess again
[2022-12-16 23:34:56] <Kagumiiin> how come
[2022-12-16 23:35:03] <@%Mikulex> But I wanna do too many things with too little time
[2022-12-16 23:36:11] <@%Mikulex> And then I end up doing nothing
[2022-12-16 23:36:33] <Kagumiiin> yeah I feel that very much
[2022-12-16 23:37:30] <Kagumiiin> with uni I can at max balance school with 2 games max

[2022-12-16 23:43:14] <@%Mikulex> But then there's actual useful stuff like languages and frameworks
[2022-12-16 23:43:16] <Kagumiiin> but I don't think its a good idea to tell you
[2022-12-16 23:43:31] <@%Mikulex> Why

[2022-12-16 23:44:21] <Kagumiiin> for one they added a card game
[2022-12-16 23:44:24] <Kagumiiin> but more importantly
[2022-12-16 23:44:48] <Kagumiiin> they added a character that if you don't know you'd think its miku with a dress
