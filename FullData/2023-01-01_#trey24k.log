[2023-01-01 02:13:58] <%SteremyJeele> It's a grey area. It's not technically stealing unless you leave the store, but it gives them a reason to be suspicious.

[2023-01-01 05:15:10] <%+papajimm> not arrested
[2023-01-01 05:15:14] <+Namaka8o8> it also depends the state some states say that a car is like someones home and you need a warrent even if they are arrested

[2023-01-01 05:15:51] <+Namaka8o8> @thot_rocket it depends on state and their interpretation
[2023-01-01 05:15:51] <+Blizzrobe> @griffinordonkey not for a motor vehicle, they are exempt from needing a warrant if the cop can prove that he was suspicious of a crime.
[2023-01-01 05:16:04] <$Dale_B0203> its not technically a search, they call it "taking inventory" of the contents of the car
[2023-01-01 05:16:06] <orgon_> in new jersey its legal to have week on u

[2023-01-01 05:16:31] <%$thot_rocket> they may need probable cause and an arrest to search it
[2023-01-01 05:16:32] <SQD_Beast> when you tow a vehicle police have to do a inventory of everything so they arent blamed for anything missing

[2023-01-01 05:17:19] <%crazygerman03> if given permission it makes it easier for the cop. if the cop doesnt have permission he then has to prove reasonable suspicion in court which means any and all evidence found in the car could be thrown out if not properly proven

[2023-01-01 05:30:03] <%rac300> he should instantly lawyer up but he also has a decision to make after speaking with his lawyer bc if he refuses to claim responsibility for the drugs, they'll likely both get charged for them
[2023-01-01 05:30:06] <%crazygerman03> its not say nothing to police its say "I hearby invoke my 5th amendment rights to remain silent and want a lawyer" if you just out right remain silent and say nothing to them they can use your silence against you.

[2023-01-01 05:34:41] <%crazygerman03> @paul_kennedy_  while you are covered by the 5th amendment when dealing with the police you need to tell them you are invoking it otherwise you just being silent and not answering their questions could be stretched to resisting or being combative. you also cant answer some questions then remain silent for others you either have to answer all of them or remain silent for all of them. its always best to just invoke the 5th amendment and let your lawyer do the talking

[2023-01-01 16:05:17] <RickyDaNerd> @jakeandbake334 I shouldn’t have to join the military for free healthcare. Our taxes could easily cover that for every citizen but instead we have $800 billion going to defense for this year…

[2023-01-01 16:06:31] <Drew_OD> Depends what country homestly, feel like America it’s too deep rooted so self defence is necessary
[2023-01-01 16:06:31] <dabombzey> i live part time in a country where guns are banned, everybody has them ilegally, as in AKs
[2023-01-01 16:06:32] <ItsBingle> @horizontalucas I take it you’re from the US?
[2023-01-01 16:06:33] <drayki1> @emilelerat i think she is smart enought to not get in danger in the first place
[2023-01-01 16:06:34] <ZvndR> @Tweak_TV Exactly ya got nothing hahahahaha
[2023-01-01 16:06:34] <SavageWoo_> In most cases youll still go to jail after defending yourself lol

[2023-01-01 16:06:40] <+evanz223> definitely cause the cops won't do anything cause that instance takes a few seconds
[2023-01-01 16:06:41] <StingE69> cops take 30m, 45ACP takes seconds
[2023-01-01 16:06:41] <greciaan> that is a huge problem bruh, not feeling safe unless you have a tool that can literally end someone's life
[2023-01-01 16:06:41] <%jakeandbake334> @RickyDaNerd anything done by the government is shit. government healthcare is shit. just grow up and get a good job so you can pay for real healthcare coverage.
[2023-01-01 16:06:41] <sv_Nikola> because you guys want the abilty to portect yourself is the reason of the school shootnigs
[2023-01-01 16:06:43] <%+xapa112> I'd rather live somewhere where im not under constant consideration of thret
[2023-01-01 16:06:43] <%RetrosPlace> citizens with weapons are the answer, all those signs on stores that say "you cant bring a weapon on the premise" is that going to stop the people who are going to break the law anyways and do bad things, more trained citizens can help prevent these conflicts
[2023-01-01 16:06:44] <%xNubbeh> how often is this happening to you @Trey24k ?
[2023-01-01 16:06:45] <+trauma_medic94> 9mm is quicker than calling law enf.

[2023-01-01 16:06:46] <$definitelykreaetor> cops dont give a fuck about you, much less children in Uvalde TX

[2023-01-01 16:06:48] <+Tweak_TV> Criminals don't obey laws typically
[2023-01-01 16:06:52] <%VOLKSFRAGEN> people who don't like guns dont want to be responsible for their own safety
[2023-01-01 16:06:55] <luminarysolar> If i moved to America how long would it take me to get a gun license?
[2023-01-01 16:06:55] <+whydream> @Trey24k im in canada i have alot of guns , we can still defend ours selfs don,t worry :) i also have an balistic armor

[2023-01-01 16:07:02] <Stinnn> In EU most homes are not made out of cardboards like US :)
[2023-01-01 16:07:03] <%HorizontaLucas> @ItsBingle what is that supposed to mean?
[2023-01-01 16:07:04] <%+king_coolboi> @Trey24k how do you feel that statistically you are more likely going to shoot yourself than get assaulted
[2023-01-01 16:07:07] <+DavidDaveDavidson> a lot of great points are being made /s
[2023-01-01 16:07:13] <0D00_> But look at homicide rates/gun death statistics in USA compared to any other country?
[2023-01-01 16:07:13] <+Tweak_TV> @ZvndR I don't need to explain anything to you, it's not worth it.
[2023-01-01 16:07:17] <%$mlodyyy____> swag like yakima
[2023-01-01 16:07:17] <%+ccccole18> Would you rather call the cops?? Or jiggle peak an intruder with an mpx
[2023-01-01 16:07:18] <epicmassacreoneu> @luminarysolar You dont need it in some states
[2023-01-01 16:07:20] <%$lt_carl_winslow> but trey, if we don't call the cops then who is going to show up to the crime scene half an hour later, write some stuff down, and do nothing?
[2023-01-01 16:07:20] <drayki1> If the System is working good people dont need guns, Germany is best example for that or Australia
[2023-01-01 16:07:24] <%angelvb1> damn id be scared asf to at that age
[2023-01-01 16:07:25] <Gunnar0620> it's much harder to get a gun in a country where it is illegal
[2023-01-01 16:07:26] <ZvndR> @Tweak_TV Then them having access to weaponary makes them more dangerous you lemon xD
[2023-01-01 16:07:27] <StingE69> damn

[2023-01-01 16:07:57] <+ganginorange3> i think it should just be way harder to get a gun in the US @Trey24k
[2023-01-01 16:07:57] <ItsBingle> @horizontalucas you have just proven my point…

[2023-01-01 16:08:02] <SweetScene> in aus, the price to attain a gun is so high that why would you need to rob people if you had that kind of money to splash around

[2023-01-01 16:09:14] <%+xapa112> he said communist KEKW
[2023-01-01 16:09:15] <Sunden96> Gun laws are only for law abiding citizens, criminals will ALWAYS fuck around so yeah, let us have the ability to defend our self
[2023-01-01 16:09:17] <+evanz223> then compare it to states like missouri
[2023-01-01 16:09:17] <sv_Nikola> its only waiting
[2023-01-01 16:09:18] <%+The_Galpster> Yes but that should be the standard EVERYWHERE/, at a bare minimum in some states you can get guns so easily
[2023-01-01 16:09:18] <emilelerat> europeans forget how big the US is, the police can easily be an hour away if not more. you have to protect yourself.

[2023-01-01 16:09:30] <RickyDaNerd> @trey24k what do you think about the proof of insurance San Jose just passed this year for your weapons in case of “accidents”
[2023-01-01 16:09:35] <+DavidDaveDavidson> everything thats not far right = communist KKona
[2023-01-01 16:09:35] <+kent_aggent> You dont need a carry permit to just go out and shoot someone
[2023-01-01 16:09:36] <%+moonmoon32> most school shooters steal guns from their parents they dont just get a gun
[2023-01-01 16:09:36] <bhonglord> in Az you don’t need a carry permit over 21
[2023-01-01 16:09:38] <+DarcSmilee> I think its the carrying stuff that is more of an issue
[2023-01-01 16:09:40] <0D00_> Most gun related deaths are caused by legally owned firearms
[2023-01-01 16:09:40] <+pdtttt> thats state-specific though, many other states you can just go to a gun show and purchase one.
[2023-01-01 16:09:40] <%HorizontaLucas> @ItsBingle no such thing as a solution to somehthing that doesnt exist

[2023-01-01 16:09:45] <%+Jugamaxx1> I got same day background check, signed a document, and purchased my handgun same day. That’s when I was military in Oklahoma tho
[2023-01-01 16:09:49] <Drew_OD> Background checks need to be more thorough
[2023-01-01 16:09:51] <%kingrazer007> I think there should be a mental check before being able to purchase. and whoever buys one for someone if they murder people they get sentenced too. I own plenty of firearms and have suppressors on the way. those were almost easier than buying the firearm. the ccp was stupid easy to get.
[2023-01-01 16:09:51] <ZvndR> @Boos all g but cmon hahahaha so silly I understand America is past the point of no return but that doesnt mean that the law isnt ridiculous

[2023-01-01 16:12:41] <%+Jugamaxx1> I think there needs to be longer/stricter classes before buying a gun as well. Like I see ppl in the military mishandle weapons, can only imagine a civilian’s potential of mishandling

[2023-01-01 16:12:49] <%HorizontaLucas> Just so yall know around 60% of "shootings" are suicides so whenever you see a statistic about gun violence from the left keep that in mind
[2023-01-01 16:12:53] <%$olliety1> @vinzillion Dont you hear shotguns going off on like a saturday or sunday morning? thats normally when people are shooting clay pigeons
[2023-01-01 16:12:54] <scart2001> @scart2001 I see why people in the US need guns. But that is where the government has failed. And the only legal way to opencarry in norway is to be Police or military. I have lived in Norway all my life and never felt treathend. Only place ive seen guns with civilians is hunting or shooting range.

[2023-01-01 16:31:03] <universule> @Trey24k logically its like this: guns legal = more guns in rotation among citizens = more guns fired = more lives taken and/or hurt

[2023-01-01 16:31:37] <someporkchop> Is an AR15 not an assault rifle tho cause they look like hella assaulty to me
[2023-01-01 16:31:38] <%killerbrandt555> No the USA per capita does not have a gun violence problem, take out suicide and gang death, and we are actually very low in gun deaths.

[2023-01-01 16:31:55] <+Jbaird0324> Mass shootings r less than 1% of all gun deaths in America
[2023-01-01 16:31:57] <%meatman24k> my mantra with guns is we should have more guns than we have hands.
[2023-01-01 16:32:01] <Galonismannen> Wait is it illegal, how come people such as brandon herrera and demo ranch own them? @Trey24k Actually curios

[2023-01-01 16:32:56] <someporkchop> Bro a semi automatic rifle with a fat ass clip can drop mad bodies versus a lil glocky firing 9mm
[2023-01-01 16:32:56] <%$RatedBud> resporator or gas mask
[2023-01-01 16:32:57] <Kepelii> Assault Rifle was the term used by an anti 2A group , real term is called " Armalite Rifle" Tyrant govt used the term to scare people @Trey24k
[2023-01-01 16:32:57] <+Tignol> i think a yearly mental health analysis would be beneficial to prevent more crazy mass shooters and at the same time i think it would be abused for gun control unfortunately
[2023-01-01 16:32:59] <+Brotnacken> âll gas masks work

[2023-01-01 16:33:16] <JMay_99> People get ar confused with assault rifle. It really means armalite rifle which is a brand.
[2023-01-01 16:33:18] <scientificsuss> So Trey and 2thy are sharing this account?
[2023-01-01 16:33:24] <%killerbrandt555> Yeah it is a fear term!

[2023-01-01 16:33:39] <%+king_coolboi> it just means the pistol grip and rails right
[2023-01-01 16:33:41] <%VOLKSFRAGEN> made up term
[2023-01-01 16:33:41] <theoil345> It really don’t matter it’s a ar auto or not shit still deadly af and kill 10s of people
[2023-01-01 16:33:42] <RickyDaNerd> @someporkchop By definition, an “assault” rifle is capable of being fully automatic.
[2023-01-01 16:33:42] <Gunnar0620> can we change topic of discussion
[2023-01-01 16:33:43] <hugoderboss8i> Patch !!!

[2023-01-01 16:33:53] <%killerbrandt555> @scientificsuss Yup, for now, once they get Kappa, they will reset the account.
[2023-01-01 16:33:53] <Kepelii> yea always been a made up term
[2023-01-01 16:33:54] <ot_index> i mean fully automatic and semi still does the same thing right
[2023-01-01 16:33:54] <+Calico_Jim> Yeah the terms are not helping
[2023-01-01 16:33:56] <%$OFPBlue_Falcon> @fellertactical yeah, I was about to say I think he only has the uzi, right?
[2023-01-01 16:33:56] <ZvndR> How many people who have gone on mass shootings with a fully automatic rifle have a license?

[2023-01-01 16:58:41] <+Tappns> @ot_index Because he wants lightkeeper faster for hype
[2023-01-01 16:58:42] <+Raumdeuter> There’s a few streamers who don’t get it legit to rush kappa and it’s so lame tbh..

[2023-01-01 17:00:21] <+Raumdeuter> The picture for the quest is a guy holding a Bolt-Action, it would incentivize people to use them more during the wipe I think

[2023-01-01 17:58:38] <$The2ThatAre1> Cheer500 people also dont understand that cops are holy grials in court. I got a speeding ticket last year and the cop tagged me going way faster than I really was. When I got a lawyer, they said that all the cop has to do is point at me and say "officer" in front of his name and the judge would side with them instead of me.

[2023-01-01 18:17:59] <!%KiraTypes> Microwaves are useful for more than just heating up leftovers. They can also make landing pads on other worlds – at least according to research released by a consortium of scientists at the University of Central Florida, Arizona State University, and Cislune, a private company. Their research shows how a combination of sorting the lunar soil and then blasting it with microwaves can create a landing pad for future rockets on the Moon Cheer100

[2023-01-01 19:43:57] <+JamoYZFR1> @JamoYZFR1 huge doubt. If they really wanted to, I'm sure they could fix the issues. I think it's a matter of greed and complacency. BSG will ride it out and milk the game as much as possible without dealing with the spaghetti code

[2023-01-01 20:02:21] <notkinger> Dont even bother scavving into lighthouse itll take 30 min

[2023-01-01 20:02:29] <+magirific> @Trey24k I did this quest by going in a pistol so i'd be marked,then having scavs  come to me
[2023-01-01 20:02:36] <jj6shooter83> Oh ok ✅
[2023-01-01 20:02:39] <%waardoggg> @notkinger been like that for days now for most people lmfao

[2023-01-01 20:02:49] <%TheQmerk> I think if you kill scavs while standing in that building, and they are on the helicopter pad it counts
[2023-01-01 20:02:51] <HeLoveHerm> What if you go in with a friend tagged and curses
[2023-01-01 20:02:54] <%waardoggg> @magirific big brain tbh

[2023-01-01 20:03:46] <HeLoveHerm> Interesting idrk how tagged and cursed works completely just an idea I’m still a little timmy

[2023-01-01 20:04:15] <SourKrent> You can kill scavs underneath the pawns as well they come up from the ramps sometimes
[2023-01-01 20:04:19] <cheesysteak18> if i get a scope can i put in on my gun
[2023-01-01 20:04:26] <+magirific> Did they adjust capturing outposts trey? That quest alone makes me not want to go for kappa container
