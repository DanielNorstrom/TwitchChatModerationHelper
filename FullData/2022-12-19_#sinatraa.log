[2022-12-19 10:16:56] <MrFlickofdaWrist> the whole point is when you run too fast with the ball even very slight contact sometimes makes you fall down really harsh, but people exaggerate just to sell it to the ref that the opposing player put way more force into the tackle than what actually did happen, i mean its all part of the game sadly

[2022-12-19 13:46:18] <shiraomi> I like to creep around my home and act like a goblin I don’t know why but I just enjoy doing this. Maybe it’s my way of dealing with stress or something but I just do it about once every week. Generally I’ll carry around a sack and creep around in a sort of crouch-walking position making goblin noises, then I’ll walk around my house and pick up various different “trinkets” and put them in my bag while saying stuff like “I’ll be having that” and laughing maniacally in my goblin voice

[2022-12-19 14:47:27] <@^Nightbot> I am Jay Won's father, and I raised him right and taught him manners and how to be a man. I did not teach him to teab*g. After three straight incidents of his behavior recently, I have disowned him. He is no longer a son of mine. I urge a boycott of Sentinels until they begin behaving like respectable men again. Come home my boy.
