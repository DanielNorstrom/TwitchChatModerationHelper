[2022-12-21 15:46:45] <zantomun> each rattlegore is a separate card id
[2022-12-21 15:47:35] VIEWERS: 372
[2022-12-21 15:47:53] <maxoupinou78> so if you only played rattlegore does it summon 3 7/4 undertaka?

[2022-12-21 15:48:15] <PeYceBall> sounds like hysteria video
[2022-12-21 15:48:46] <tm_war> maybe you can discover rattlegore in paladin using the gagetzan cards but that is so extremely unlikely

[2022-12-21 16:13:36] <Glax_87> @shirozely I'm talking about the standard (a druid's common card is definitely better than a paladin's legendary) you take the 6 mana that makes your card a health cost (the no sense) you should take 7 damage to cheat a mana?!?! really?? (total junk)

[2022-12-21 18:34:11] <%dumbgamerboy> Wildfire was my favorite card they ever printed, then they buffed it to 1 mana and I couldn't run it in even mage anymore
