[2022-12-23 13:57:23] <%+SyncedXD> Storytime: The old lady i gave a room back when i was working as a night porter was waiting outside of the hotel i worked at. It was cold and raining on Christmas eve. I asked her if she was waiting for someone and she told me she was waiting for her son but he couldn't make it to her in time so it left her stranded with no place to go. I told her to get inside so she could warm up. I gave her a room even though it could get me fired. I spend Christmas eve with her and she told me stories
[2022-12-23 13:57:25] <%+rsyncd> They were probably had their green tea spiked with "herbs" and you were the cleanest there KEKW

[2022-12-23 14:33:11] <%seethingaardvark> @amber_jade22 I think it's because of vaccination rates mainly, because it increases the likelihood of mutations if people aren't vaccinated, and I don't think South Africa is super dangerous but it does have high crime rates compared to Australia which is pretty safe
