[2022-12-17 10:05:51] <%rich106848> YEP the whole time i was just spamming abilities and not moving much KEKG
[2022-12-17 10:06:02] <+ishkablob> G4 prog was by far the most fun for me so far, it’s challenging and requires flexibility but it isn’t too hard once you see the mechs a few times
[2022-12-17 10:06:34] <+ishkablob> I said by far and so far Weirdge
[2022-12-17 10:06:36] <bubsito_> I think g4 is the most fun too
[2022-12-17 10:06:42] <+ishkablob> My streamer can’t read Sadge
[2022-12-17 10:07:10] <bubsito_> But I also like fighting prokel
[2022-12-17 10:07:24] <+asobooo> i dont find a pt for g4
[2022-12-17 10:07:27] <+asobooo> in SA
[2022-12-17 10:07:37] <itsfexyy> G4 popular but NA had a hard time with it imo
[2022-12-17 10:07:58] <bubsito_> Maybe I just dislike g5 and 6 too much
[2022-12-17 10:08:00] <bubsito_> LUL
[2022-12-17 10:08:06] <itsfexyy> Try finding a party in na w almost impossible lmao
[2022-12-17 10:08:13] <%rich106848> naw is also hard
[2022-12-17 10:08:19] <+Traynor123> g4 just feels chaotic which is fun
[2022-12-17 10:08:19] <+asobooo> is hard because we are join with Br and we talk spanish and portuguese is hard to communicate with them

[2022-12-17 10:09:03] <+ishkablob> Was kinda surprised
[2022-12-17 10:09:04] <+asobooo> the problem is the communication is hard to understand br people when you are learning how to do that
[2022-12-17 10:10:06] <itsfexyy> Almost done with punika let’s goo

Or do you think the bus culture is kind off detrimental for the game so you don't want to contribuite to it? or its simply too much effort to do those guides and not many people are interested?

[2022-12-17 13:08:45] <kilroy2400> Do you know if it's "viable" in the long run to not play multiple chars?
[2022-12-17 13:08:46] <Mikrobiukas> @Emank11 Amogus
[2022-12-17 13:08:58] <gionnisins> !watchtime
[2022-12-17 13:08:59] <summaknotts> @kilroy2400 its for your mental ;D
[2022-12-17 13:09:05] <HeySkrillz> people just put it on ah for 1 mil, but on eu at least no one buys it ^^
[2022-12-17 13:09:39] <Mikrobiukas> @kilroy2400 yeh, I believe Saint had 1-2 chars for like three years or something
[2022-12-17 13:09:41] <ChangedMyNameManyTimes> is it viable to walk on 1 leg? yes , is it a good idea ? No
[2022-12-17 13:09:42] <%rich106848> @kilroy2400 viable for the game to have multiple chars but not viable for your mental health KEKW
[2022-12-17 13:09:48] <summaknotts> @HeySkrillz ima say it for the ppl in back, its because theres more rmters in NA or at least in the west
[2022-12-17 13:09:51] <al5ar8> do you think shadow hunter need a small buff ?
[2022-12-17 13:09:51] <%+JinXv> its like buying a 1m gold stone KEKW
[2022-12-17 13:09:56] <kilroy2400> summaknotts Ya, I don't have the time or the mental for multiple. I have like 1 main and a lopang
[2022-12-17 13:10:01] <itsfexyy> Good way to farm gold?
[2022-12-17 13:10:03] <HeySkrillz> @summaknotts thats maybe
[2022-12-17 13:10:17] <itsfexyy> Stuck and can’t hone cause no gold :(
[2022-12-17 13:10:20] <gionnisins> its worse than stone though
[2022-12-17 13:10:44] <owaferss> imagine buying it and dismantling it by mistake lop
[2022-12-17 13:10:45] <summaknotts> @kilroy2400 i havent done brel yet and honestly im good with that
[2022-12-17 13:10:52] <kilroy2400> I've been able to keep up decently for the time being, currently sitting at 1515
[2022-12-17 13:11:07] <+Tuujj> How hard is it to catchup now being a newer player?
[2022-12-17 13:11:08] <al5ar8> how he got selver
[2022-12-17 13:11:22] <ChangedMyNameManyTimes> @Tuujj its impossible to catch
[2022-12-17 13:11:25] <Mikrobiukas> @kilroy2400 higher than my main with 6 chars KEKW
[2022-12-17 13:11:35] <itsfexyy> @tuujj I went from 249 to 1314 in a week
[2022-12-17 13:11:46] <kilroy2400> Mikrobiukas it's viable to run 1 char if you're lucky with honing KEKW
[2022-12-17 13:12:06] <+8081808> how much did you spend?
[2022-12-17 13:12:13] <%Xsquire> WAYTOODANK
[2022-12-17 13:12:26] <Mikrobiukas> @kilroy2400 well gearing alts takes a big chunk of gold as well, ¬200k for accs and ¬100k for gems or so
[2022-12-17 13:12:44] <+Tuujj> Just to get to sort of end game , doesnt have to be hardest raids etc
[2022-12-17 13:12:56] <kilroy2400> Mikrobiukas yea. there's probably some optimization for my main to be done as well
[2022-12-17 13:13:34] <al5ar8> it is worth to gear char more then you 6main just for buss ?
[2022-12-17 13:13:38] <edvynas_> Brel raids are a gamechanger imo... game just feels way better now
[2022-12-17 13:13:41] <rezM3> with green runes YEP
[2022-12-17 13:13:46] <Mikrobiukas> @Tuujj if you follow material guides with islands you reach first 2 legion raids in less than a week
[2022-12-17 13:13:55] <edvynas_> Downside is that only 5 supports get to gate 3 lol
[2022-12-17 13:14:07] <+Tuujj> @Mikrobiukas Any recommendations for a guide to follow then ?
[2022-12-17 13:14:28] <riphLv> BBoomer

[2022-12-17 13:14:46] <Gasinox> @Mikrobiukas search for maxroll island guide
[2022-12-17 13:14:51] <Mikrobiukas> @Tuujj maxroll has rush level 50, or something similar guide, theres like 20 islands that give mats and they push you almost instantly for t3
[2022-12-17 13:15:17] <al5ar8> it is worth to gear char more then you 6main just for buss ?
[2022-12-17 13:15:18] <NaIsGigaTrash> Guys if you're over 25 and playign this game you're an OMEGA BOOMER SOYER :)
[2022-12-17 13:15:27] <Mikrobiukas> ah yes
[2022-12-17 13:15:31] <MokSu1337> u think its make new char now or prepare everything for new powerpass (gems,books, gold for accessories etc) ?
[2022-12-17 13:15:32] <dujilli> destroyer looks so much more fun than zerker :/
[2022-12-17 13:15:33] <%+Bloddysoad> only when you clear Punika once I think
[2022-12-17 13:15:45] <Butterman2141> you need to have clear punija at least once
[2022-12-17 13:15:47] <obelixOO7> i you are new u have to, no?

[2022-12-17 13:19:54] <hexderop> hello, I have a small question. I have both CD and KBW but im undecided on which I should put on my surgeblade. for reference, the other 4 engraves are surge, adren, ambush, grudge
[2022-12-17 13:20:27] <+mattyydubzz> yeah i have like 8 lopang slaves not on my main roster lol

[2022-12-17 13:22:05] <+deondge> Hey @atk if u transfer wep to the new Brel one, how big is the damage increase!
[2022-12-17 13:22:33] <Mikrobiukas> gatekeeping is insane at all levels, rough getting any parties if youre on ilvl
[2022-12-17 13:22:51] <!myodyne> catJAM
[2022-12-17 13:23:05] <ChangedMyNameManyTimes> maybe the raid ilvl design is flawed
[2022-12-17 13:23:25] <Mikrobiukas> try making parties of randoms to do same thing next week if theyre also pugging
[2022-12-17 13:23:25] <ChangedMyNameManyTimes> hurts new players
[2022-12-17 13:23:29] <Razor__95> been trying to get in a learning party for clown for the last 2 weeks and havent been able to do it SadgeCry
[2022-12-17 13:23:34] <%jaded2355> got gatekept on brel g1-g2. on ilvl. 5x3, covetous slayer. lvl 59 character :/
[2022-12-17 13:23:41] <+rfr0zen> discord communities are usually better then guilds , they are cross server and people actually play togheder
[2022-12-17 13:23:46] <%Eunactes> wideVIBE
[2022-12-17 13:23:53] <ChangedMyNameManyTimes> making learning parties takes time like half  a day if you want to learn properly

[2022-12-17 13:24:14] <Mikrobiukas> ^ we had discord of 20 randoms that pugged and then did clown together
[2022-12-17 13:24:39] <Jeolart> so is the definition of gatekeeping getting denied from one party or whats up? I just insta apply to a different one and soon im in, every character.
[2022-12-17 13:24:43] <Icefraction> yo does anyone know if bracelets gets "upgraded" like ability stones do?

[2022-12-17 13:40:01] <summaknotts> i think the auctioneer controls it
[2022-12-17 13:40:16] <%Xsquire> because the auctioneer will ask for the next set amount

[2022-12-17 15:18:23] <+MoveJoe> maybe a topic: Should the cost of a class influence the dmg/performance?
[2022-12-17 15:18:41] <+moosebruiser1> change propulsion to trigger when you use a skill that moves your character
[2022-12-17 15:18:44] <+BogzyMan> lets not make every class a back attacker imo
[2022-12-17 15:18:44] <keniecr> holding for years just to get Knocked down or have boss turn or move

[2022-12-17 15:19:09] <+hedgehog_d_sonic> i feel like they can change ps sh attacks to non directional and make it a hit master spec
[2022-12-17 15:19:31] <+xAntiGewalt> is there a way to see LOAn from the west
[2022-12-17 15:19:41] <+moosebruiser1> @hedgehog_d_sonic the issue then is that everyone will have to switch their spec to hit master from ambush master
[2022-12-17 15:19:44] <summaknotts> @hedgehog_d_sonic hit master PS sounds fun
[2022-12-17 15:19:59] <55amin> why is he here

[2022-12-17 15:21:54] <summaknotts> @hedgehog_d_sonic reaper high skill ceiling is high and its so fun
[2022-12-17 15:22:25] <PreziX1> they should add easy mode, what will be easier to complete but with less rewards

[2022-12-17 15:24:44] <+BogzyMan> because they release the raids so damn fast, 2-3months is insanity
[2022-12-17 15:24:48] <+Luckyn1604> alt meta is the thing causing this rush

[2022-12-17 15:26:55] <Fatamerikans> limit 3 characters EZ
[2022-12-17 15:27:06] <randomvxz0> i support the current thing MrDestructoid
[2022-12-17 15:27:06] <+Skycerer> Remove 6 chars = more inflation and penalice the mental sanity
[2022-12-17 15:27:06] <+BogzyMan> why not lower honing gold instead
[2022-12-17 15:27:06] <wyzgowski> holla im back again
[2022-12-17 15:27:08] <+Luckyn1604> I would actually think lowering the limit would increase the legion time, and reduce the stress from it
[2022-12-17 15:27:12] <%ruisssssss> hmmMeeting
[2022-12-17 15:27:13] <DeadlyBrother> that would make it worse
[2022-12-17 15:27:13] <Avenuee2> worst thing about limiting to 6 character is it punishes you for trying new class when you already have 6 main
[2022-12-17 15:27:46] <ghost1551> @ATK faster dailies would be really nice
[2022-12-17 15:27:54] <MrUniCornePower> new class release is useless with 6 limit but if they remove it 20char andies gonna destroy the game Sadge
[2022-12-17 15:28:01] <+minus_gbf> @ghost1551 yesssss
[2022-12-17 15:28:09] <%+Lopsided_Pickle> limit the amount of gold you can charge for accs?
[2022-12-17 15:28:13] <+minus_gbf> turning 12x chaos/guardians into 6x would help a lot
[2022-12-17 15:28:16] <+Skycerer> I would love doing only 1 chaos and 1 guardian per day
[2022-12-17 15:28:18] <%BaTu016> if we did gate 1-4 how much do i need to get my 2 pieces to 1520 guys
[2022-12-17 15:28:21] <%BaTu016> anyone know ?
[2022-12-17 15:28:23] <%+Saphy91> cool idea would be somthing like 18x legion raids per account and u can choose urself if u wanne do those on ur main char or spread them across ur alts
[2022-12-17 15:28:31] <Ectorr_> For the western version, no matter what they gonna do to be honest.
[2022-12-17 15:28:35] <+Shangudra> in game Game masters, and bann every single bot... this is my new year wish....
[2022-12-17 15:28:36] <poopipop> This sense of urgency and alts stuff cause gatekeeping too, people being too picky in LFG because they dont wanna waste time with new players

[2022-12-17 15:47:57] <+mauriziomama> tier 4 is the answer to those issues
[2022-12-17 15:48:11] <summaknotts> people requiire it because theyre trash

[2022-12-17 15:48:17] <summaknotts> "skip mechs"
[2022-12-17 15:48:27] <shortyshortywita40> everyone is trying to speedrun the raids and not enjoy them
[2022-12-17 15:48:29] <+Luckyn1604> The idea come from the fact they want to clean it faster to do it on every alts, so every point of damage source is needed to make it faster
[2022-12-17 15:48:32] <keniecr> YEP
[2022-12-17 15:48:32] <%+Mistressapocalypse> like roster level could skip mechs

[2022-12-17 15:48:40] <+EscoNaija> Raid RESTED
[2022-12-17 15:48:42] <huxenn> a false sense of safety too,
[2022-12-17 15:48:48] <+Excoupe7> @Luckyn1604 they have every right to ask this but it sucks for new players
[2022-12-17 15:48:52] <%+diiarmuid> @JustOneDuck_ depend on what if i see 1500+ roster below 50 looks kinda whale
[2022-12-17 15:48:53] <n0llad> i got declined on my 1520 alt because i didnt have +25 weapon or a level 10 gem
[2022-12-17 15:48:58] <JustOneDuck_> @Mistressapocalypse i mean even item lvl doesnt mean shit
[2022-12-17 15:49:01] <n0llad> in g6 brel
[2022-12-17 15:49:06] <DIRTSPITTER> if raid rested then there are gonnna be less lobbies. even less supports
[2022-12-17 15:49:06] <%+maitrekirby> because the full version of the game exist ansd people spend more time witaching you guys than enjoying the game the base there standards on yours
[2022-12-17 15:49:06] <+systech_32> because of alts
[2022-12-17 15:49:08] <JustOneDuck_> @JustOneDuck_ okay not to that extreme
[2022-12-17 15:49:18] <+BogzyMan> @n0llad no, u got declined cuz 10 other dps applied
[2022-12-17 15:49:23] <AsherNoMic> cant fix that only people fix themselves? DX
[2022-12-17 15:49:29] <summaknotts> @maitrekirby ppl FOMO outside of the game
[2022-12-17 15:49:31] <WestSan> Does esther weapons make any difference for supports?
[2022-12-17 15:49:37] <JustOneDuck_> @JustOneDuck_ but i always see people being declined on 100-120 roster lvl
[2022-12-17 15:49:45] <n0llad> @BogzyMan No because they changed title to +25 weapon or +10 gem after i applied.
[2022-12-17 15:49:48] <keniecr> it's about roaster of 6 main gold gains
[2022-12-17 15:49:54] <+Luckyn1604> @Excoupe7 i totally agree, I'm not against it as well, just this 6 alts meta with 2h daily is so time consuming that people find stupid reason to gatekeep to make stuff faster
[2022-12-17 15:49:54] <+Valk543> Give 2x the rewards but reduce the number of daily runs from 2 to 1
[2022-12-17 15:50:00] <Asmii> I wouldnt feel as interested if they removed the amount of weeklies
[2022-12-17 15:50:01] <h34v3nl1> I suggest the legion raid is bi weekly reset so people can have more time to enjoy/finish the raid
[2022-12-17 15:50:03] <+minus_gbf> nah dfo is even more grindeir rn
[2022-12-17 15:50:03] <+TwoPillows> yeah they gotta do something about the 6 char, it burns people the fuck out
[2022-12-17 15:50:03] <%+Mistressapocalypse> @JustOneDuck_ my friend got declined even with 210 KEKW
[2022-12-17 15:50:04] <%+diiarmuid> @JustOneDuck_ i see what you mean, agree on that
[2022-12-17 15:50:10] <AsherNoMic> they need to fix the argos forces people to only invite 1445+ for argos (for standard run)
[2022-12-17 15:50:14] <PAIKING94> @atk how about making most raids 4 ppl? easier to find groups and less risk of getting a bozo in the group
[2022-12-17 15:50:25] <Bruustu> that would be heaven tbh
[2022-12-17 15:50:28] <+BogzyMan> i dont want that as a 1 main enjoyer
[2022-12-17 15:50:29] <mejuliie_> @maitrekirby That is actually a big problem. Watching people who've played years, sets unrealistically high expectations.
[2022-12-17 15:50:30] <+12345norden> rested legion raids could be an ideas
[2022-12-17 15:50:35] <%+maitrekirby> @maitrekirby agreed that said the fomo comes a lot from what you re seeing and also the culture that has been catered at the beginning
[2022-12-17 15:50:52] <+f0ndle> hi atk, for g6 brel when we enter chan-mi, how do you deal with platforms being broken when the mech starts? my party mates say they had no where to stand for 3x and 3x+1 because their platform was broken when it started
[2022-12-17 15:50:56] <+Excoupe7> @Luckyn1604 exactly. hope they do something about it the upcomnig year. I'm hopeful for LOAON

[2022-12-17 15:57:31] <aiuanacry> Here's my take, get rid of the challenge modes and use that balance system instead in the initial areas dungeons (not the abyss) so T3 players can help new players and get T3 materials out of it. This would make those areas much more lively to the new players, the old players would not be bored to death of repeating the same thing and it would be enjoyable to try them with T3 nerfed chars.  Get rid of the speed up to T3 and allow the players to enjoy the initial tier by reducing the back and for

[2022-12-17 16:39:04] <smokensnail> @ATK When you said that you liked the Mythic + in WoW, they could implement that concept but for boss rush, no?
[2022-12-17 16:39:51] <+Lighttell321> they should just make it 1 chaos and 1 guardian raid per char
[2022-12-17 16:40:24] <smokensnail> 100% agree, but most games have new content that can only last for so long. Most people run through games so fast that developers can't keep up.

[2022-12-17 16:49:33] <Crosskun> how is artist compared to pld n brd????
[2022-12-17 16:49:34] <Transcendence> artist is her own class right? so we cant make a character to prep
[2022-12-17 16:49:37] <%fewtur> maybe January because Roxx said they post Roadmap before the content drop and the road map will be dropped hopefully before the end of the year
[2022-12-17 16:49:43] <FamiMisaki> ill be building DPS and Supp on her KEKL
[2022-12-17 16:49:45] <VanillaRaspberries> @Transcendence yeah, can't stack the rest bonus
[2022-12-17 16:49:46] <+VankoHuntz> ATK One question, Why you shouldn't counter right before the throne guimic in Vykas Gate 2, when you need to get mind controled?
[2022-12-17 16:50:00] <+VIPVeZuZ> thanks for opinion guys <3 i hope most of you are right and we get the Arist/Aero soon :D <3
[2022-12-17 16:50:00] <PauliusMaximus> is artist comlex or pretty stright forward?
[2022-12-17 16:50:06] <+JesninPlays> Do u think GS needs a buff again?

[2022-12-17 16:51:10] <FamiMisaki> @JesninPlays as a GS main I'd say she's okay right now but honestly get rid of the <50% Rifle buff limiter from her and give her a consistent buff that works throughout the raid
[2022-12-17 16:51:11] <+JesninPlays> Artist better support than the other 2?
[2022-12-17 16:51:20] <frm_da_bush> on EU west even iif you counter if your character doesn't move out of the center you will get miind controled
[2022-12-17 16:51:21] <scar2812> what does her bubbles do?
[2022-12-17 16:51:28] <FamiMisaki> maybe the tripods that work past <50% hp targets might be good as they are but idk, we dont have a rifle change
[2022-12-17 16:51:39] <frm_da_bush> don't cpounter **
[2022-12-17 16:52:53] <+JesninPlays> @famimisaki yea def that peacemaker engraving needs a buff. Raids that doesnt last long makes the engraving useless

[2022-12-17 16:58:32] <+RetroShinigamii> Man I think Gate 6 is the worst designed gate so far lmao

[2022-12-17 16:59:00] <+CJBulldogs> hard doesn't equal bad design
[2022-12-17 16:59:15] <honneylemz> gate 6 where dreams come to die
[2022-12-17 16:59:16] <+RetroShinigamii> The tiles should just reset if you push a mech fast idk
[2022-12-17 16:59:20] <Matts0_> on brel gate 6 does the regen timer on a tile resets when it gets hit by a golden meteor?
[2022-12-17 16:59:23] <Applepie2112> my static was already holding dps for 1min+ its just gonna get worse
[2022-12-17 16:59:24] <+RetroShinigamii> it just feels awful
[2022-12-17 16:59:26] <PauliusMaximus> i think it can if it's hard for bad reasons
[2022-12-17 16:59:27] <+tzefri0513> How is your artillerist ATK?
[2022-12-17 16:59:46] <mamijin> You think will there be a change at db in next balance patch?

[2022-12-17 17:01:10] <%+salpngytis> G4 was so much fun
[2022-12-17 17:01:13] <FaintRhymes> gate 3 is my favorite
[2022-12-17 17:01:20] <VanillaRaspberries> welcome to the cube
[2022-12-17 17:01:21] <%+Daniel54721> I mean as a Gunlancer its good but otherwise meh
[2022-12-17 17:01:21] <OviHyperion> g3 was a bit too easy imo
[2022-12-17 17:01:22] <+Jungk4> gate 3 enjoyers GIGACHAD
[2022-12-17 17:01:24] <FamiMisaki> yeah I think so too. it also felt / looks unique
[2022-12-17 17:01:25] <ZenithWho> the camera angle ngl made me get a headache
[2022-12-17 17:01:26] <ryzen3900xt> hate g4 i call it vertigo arena
[2022-12-17 17:01:26] <%aurellis> g5 best gate
[2022-12-17 17:01:29] <+Defiant_Lights> I love the dynamic of the camera angle but it messed up some people in my static.
[2022-12-17 17:01:29] <%+Daniel54721> Gate 3 so easy after nerf OMEGALUL
[2022-12-17 17:01:29] <%+robyn_hode> i really like gate 3
[2022-12-17 17:01:30] <%Iratus_eu> gate 3 and 4 were my fav
[2022-12-17 17:01:43] <Tortoyk> gate 3 enjoyers GIGACHAD
[2022-12-17 17:01:48] <FamiMisaki> its probably just me being a try hard. So many things to do in a gate KEKL
[2022-12-17 17:01:50] <jokemix714> my first pull of g4 i was so lost it was hilarious
[2022-12-17 17:01:50] <ryzen3900xt> cleared g3 last night with 3 of us alive only
[2022-12-17 17:01:54] <+darksun2020> I thought Gate 4 was going to be terrible but it wasn't as bad as I thought
[2022-12-17 17:01:56] <trung121173> lmao imagine
[2022-12-17 17:02:01] <EzylKou> isnt medusa on hard mode? or it was on normal before too @ATK
[2022-12-17 17:02:02] <Kurotsunee> I'm also glad it got nerfed a bit. I did 40 bars duo with a bard to clear it
[2022-12-17 17:02:03] <ThePhilipus> me and my friends had so much fun in g4
[2022-12-17 17:02:06] <%+salpngytis> G3 was a bit too easy
[2022-12-17 17:02:07] <FamiMisaki> you dont really see these kinds of raids anywhere else
[2022-12-17 17:02:08] <ThePhilipus> i didnt think i'd like it that much
[2022-12-17 17:02:10] <FaintRhymes> gate 6 enjoyers KevinTurtle
[2022-12-17 17:02:11] <LeumasIX> KR players dealt with some extra bs
[2022-12-17 17:02:12] <VanillaRaspberries> was playing gate 4 on deja vu, got 16 stacks of debuff and got hit for 70k and instadied
[2022-12-17 17:02:19] <+RetroShinigamii> Nerf Gate 6 so I can pump damage lmao
[2022-12-17 17:02:22] <Tylaron> you can clear it solo cant you
[2022-12-17 17:02:34] <Tylaron> it just resets her hp then she doesnt do the mech again
[2022-12-17 17:02:38] <%fewtur> @salpngytis yeah 1 tapped it after just reading a cheatsheeet
[2022-12-17 17:03:07] <FamiMisaki> lmao me and 2 of my static members were left for the 0hp scythes and we still cleared it
[2022-12-17 17:03:23] <kiiimchy> @ATK do you need exactly 6 stacks or can it be more ?
[2022-12-17 17:03:42] <%+Daniel54721> We didnt know you can just kill her after scythe failed at 5
[2022-12-17 17:03:47] <%Eunactes> ICANT my brel group said your guide is too complex and its unnecessary to put the normal pattern in the guide, but they always get hit by the normal patterns, making me heal eventhough im a spec bard
[2022-12-17 17:03:51] <%+Daniel54721> Everyone was surprised lol
[2022-12-17 17:04:04] <%Eunactes> i fucking hate it

[2022-12-17 17:04:32] <%Eunactes> they cant even dodge it
[2022-12-17 17:04:32] <%agal266> how do you bus in g4 red cube stagger mech with 2m?
[2022-12-17 17:04:39] <FaintRhymes> nah i like how atk puts the normal patterns at the end
[2022-12-17 17:04:44] <BigDragonJuicer> i like detail
[2022-12-17 17:04:44] <ThePhilipus> the guide was great
[2022-12-17 17:04:48] <elswallace> I mean I like the detail version
[2022-12-17 17:04:49] <BigDragonJuicer> i still cant dodge the g3 stabby stab counter lol
[2022-12-17 17:04:50] <+JesninPlays> Theres a reddit post about your brel videos complaining how confusing your explanations are lol
[2022-12-17 17:04:50] <%Eunactes> @agal266 destro/GL VPH
[2022-12-17 17:04:52] <%+Daniel54721> normal patterns are a must for G4 tho
[2022-12-17 17:04:53] <FamiMisaki> I appreciate the normal pattern guide part. It really helps a lot
[2022-12-17 17:04:58] <elswallace> Because you can find all the things

[2022-12-17 17:05:27] <honneylemz> or you know, the viewers can just skip the parts they don't link
[2022-12-17 17:05:28] <FamiMisaki> same. People can also pick up the boss moveset quicker if they watched it
[2022-12-17 17:05:32] <%Eunactes> thats why i dont really need to heal myself, if i get hit i just use my pots, but my group ran out of pots ICANT

[2022-12-17 17:06:06] <FamiMisaki> its fine, any guide can confuse anyone too. Its like learning in school its not for everybody
[2022-12-17 17:06:14] <eskai3> commentary runs help too
[2022-12-17 17:06:15] <FamiMisaki> people undertand things differently
[2022-12-17 17:06:17] <redarmy321> Cleared brel  1-6 last night with friends after 10hrs total. Thanks to ur guides!! @atk
[2022-12-17 17:06:26] <%+Big_Numbers> Did you provide clips for the written guide from mobalytics?
[2022-12-17 17:06:30] <%Eunactes> @eskai3 he has commentary run on both dps and support
[2022-12-17 17:06:34] <FamiMisaki> True or watching other clear run videos helps out a lot

[2022-12-17 17:07:50] <zbychomir> I like your guides because they are detailed and have normal patterns. There are alredy a lot of ytubers doing short tldw guides
[2022-12-17 17:07:51] <$Syed9857> whats funny is that 5 felt jail but 6 felt not too bad
[2022-12-17 17:07:53] <+Jungk4> 5 6 is a time investment YEP
[2022-12-17 17:07:53] <FamiMisaki> how long does it take for you to complete brel gear without the auction boxes?
[2022-12-17 17:07:53] <%Eunactes> and people said "ATK's guide is too long" eventhough ATK literally said "detailed guide" on every brel guide video ICANT
[2022-12-17 17:08:04] <LeumasIX> super excited for loa-on, i hope you get a E-boner atk
[2022-12-17 17:08:29] <bazoinx> does brel count as 3 legion raid entrys if you complete every single gate
[2022-12-17 17:08:29] <+hibari112> what time is loa on?

[2022-12-17 17:10:03] <$Syed9857> do you think its worth it to push main to 1560 for hard 5-6 because my feeling right now is that we won't have enough time to get mats before hard comes out
[2022-12-17 17:10:29] <%bubsito_> we will have like at least 3 months
[2022-12-17 17:10:51] <+Jungk4> 1560 isnt that hard with full brel gear

[2022-12-17 17:11:12] <Jiten> shard cost alone is insane
[2022-12-17 17:11:17] <Seanthedemiurge> does it matter if u cast sticky moss or elcid first in initial rotation?
[2022-12-17 17:11:26] <+Bluewoofz> shards Despairge
[2022-12-17 17:11:28] <MykL1> 600k isnt enough?

[2022-12-17 17:23:21] <p3rry666> I get gatekeep on clown
[2022-12-17 17:23:42] <$Syed9857> most people in my experience just look at ilvl and engravings and then maybe gems or card sets
[2022-12-17 17:23:55] <yimmyb> i dont have set level 2 and didnt have a problem finding a group
[2022-12-17 17:23:55] <Jimotthy> @Claaay69 Its not just the lvl 2, id be more concerned that you havent deal with clown. No offense but it would make me think you're at a lower skill level than those that have done clown
[2022-12-17 17:24:05] <+joshstation2> ppl see big number and go nuts
[2022-12-17 17:24:12] <@^StreamElements> Check out Mobalytics Brelshaza raid guides here - https://moba.lol/3VXtjnu
[2022-12-17 17:24:16] <+imjohnlol> at least rn in beginning theres lots of parties open on each gate
[2022-12-17 17:24:22] <Claaay69> true true thank you mr atk and chat
[2022-12-17 17:24:23] <+JesninPlays> NA is already gatekeeping and just looking for reclearers lol
[2022-12-17 17:24:23] <%rich106848> my 1497 soulfist with brel gear got gatekeeped alot in clown KEKW
[2022-12-17 17:24:30] <+HauNow> ive only done g1-2 clown and finished brel so idk man
[2022-12-17 17:24:31] <FamiMisaki> yeah...
[2022-12-17 17:24:33] <FamiMisaki> its really bad
[2022-12-17 17:24:34] <%killerjoker123> it is
[2022-12-17 17:24:35] <+joshstation2> in their mind 1500 lvl with lvl 5 gems is better than a 1490 with 7 gems
[2022-12-17 17:24:37] <%killerjoker123> its really bad
[2022-12-17 17:24:41] <ilkeidz> today i got my blade alt at 1460 and pally at 1445  im so happy
[2022-12-17 17:24:47] <%Marcey97> I dont think asking for reclears is an issue. People dont wanna reprog 6 times
[2022-12-17 17:24:50] <FamiMisaki> If there's anything wrong with the game right now that causes burn out in raids thats pretty much it imo
[2022-12-17 17:24:51] <Kluzien> for some reason everyone does a bad job of gatekeeping, only check item level
[2022-12-17 17:24:53] <+Excoupe7> the thing is, everyone is complaining about gatekeeping but everyone is also gatekeeping. there's no simple solution
[2022-12-17 17:24:58] <%lostsoulz1010> people gatekeep valtan even if you 1470 with full relic
[2022-12-17 17:25:02] <%lostsoulz1010> it's crazy
[2022-12-17 17:25:12] <$Syed9857> the only thing i gatekeep in my party is proper stats because i dont want rainbow stat players
[2022-12-17 17:25:27] <+JesninPlays> @marcey97 problem is all of the lobbies are asking for reclears now
[2022-12-17 17:25:29] <%Marcey97> its not really gatekeeping if someone better applies. There is no reason to pick a worse equipped player
[2022-12-17 17:25:34] <+joshstation2> stats is the first thing i look at
[2022-12-17 17:25:36] <+pearred> @lostsoulz1010 thats because youre applying to juiced gropus
[2022-12-17 17:25:44] <+gugygugy> Even just trying to get supp for caliligos alt run is cancer
[2022-12-17 17:25:56] <FamiMisaki> @Marcey97 that is true, however the lobbies dont often see "better equipped players" they just wait for certain Ilvls
[2022-12-17 17:26:21] <%Marcey97> Im just trading Supps for Cal with my guild
[2022-12-17 17:26:22] <FamiMisaki> they do not care if you have 5x3 with lv 7 gems for the most part if you are 1460 for Vykas HM as an example
[2022-12-17 17:26:22] <mmayhem7> gunlancer doesnt need support luckily KEKW
[2022-12-17 17:26:22] <ilkeidz> @lostsoulz1010 Yesterday  on my alt 5x3 RE blade 1650 spec gems lv7 i went into a valtan  and they didnt want to accept KEKW
[2022-12-17 17:26:23] <Claaay69> its hard to get a supp for caliligos
[2022-12-17 17:26:29] <+joshstation2> some 1520 bozo runs arround  with a swift piece on a DB
[2022-12-17 17:26:29] <+haarioo> !armory
[2022-12-17 17:26:30] <@^StreamElements> bit.ly/3Vmh9nR press "character" to see all characters
[2022-12-17 17:26:30] <gurpanda> hard and fast
[2022-12-17 17:26:37] <aiuanacry> Fun thing about complaining about no Supports is that those are usually the same people who place their engraving books for a fortune.
[2022-12-17 17:26:40] <$Syed9857> luckily for carl, supps can reclear with their friends after collecting soul
[2022-12-17 17:26:40] <FamiMisaki> Honestly its not that supports are not popular
[2022-12-17 17:26:43] <SouKK> true KEKL
[2022-12-17 17:26:51] <chibbibilly> is artist a good support? @ATK
[2022-12-17 17:26:51] <Kluzien> all of our supports are toxic and Madge AF too
[2022-12-17 17:26:52] <%+UnicornPotatoMan> my bard is 1500 GIGACHAD but im in a static so sorry pugs lol
[2022-12-17 17:26:54] <LunarKitsune> i'm waiting for artist personally
[2022-12-17 17:26:54] <FamiMisaki> Its more because of the fact that supports usually want to get carried by juicers. They cherrry pick the people they play with
[2022-12-17 17:27:02] <+KronicWoW> What item level do we get Hanu?
[2022-12-17 17:27:04] <eskai3> i have  4 sup  cuz i am lazy
[2022-12-17 17:27:05] <%Marcey97> Id play full supp roster if there were more than 21
[2022-12-17 17:27:09] <+chingiee> when do u need 5x3 as support?
[2022-12-17 17:27:09] <FamiMisaki> Thats the common consensus with supports these days if you look at lobbies managed by supports
[2022-12-17 17:27:11] <Claaay69> supps are a rare breed
[2022-12-17 17:27:11] <+jeef223> i did my pally 3x3
[2022-12-17 17:27:11] <+gugygugy> 1490 sup 3x3 made lobby, only pick 1520 dps kekw
[2022-12-17 17:27:11] <%Marcey97> 2
[2022-12-17 17:27:14] <+jeef223> for brel
[2022-12-17 17:27:23] <+joshstation2> i love the supps that go 4 engravings and have like expertise stat
[2022-12-17 17:27:23] <ismellteletubby> When artist is out i will switch to support main, I might save some pugs
[2022-12-17 17:27:26] <+loa_goofy> West rather builds DPS with 3x3 and dogsht Stats+ gems then make A supp , rather leech on a dps then a supp so weird
[2022-12-17 17:27:27] <just1ceex> ATK that why i made 2 sup alts ...
[2022-12-17 17:27:28] <VanillaRaspberries> yeah id play more supports if there were more support classes, have a bard and pally already
[2022-12-17 17:27:48] <yunyunku> my pally got accepted for 1-4 with 3*3 KEKW
[2022-12-17 17:27:50] <+jeef223> maybe if they make a support class that shield/heals more if they do damage, gunslinger//shooter support class
[2022-12-17 17:27:53] <PauliusMaximus> 4 of my 6 gold charactets are supps KEKW will be all 6 when artist comes out
[2022-12-17 17:27:55] <+loa_goofy> then also dont ask for a Support
[2022-12-17 17:27:59] <FamiMisaki> HEH
[2022-12-17 17:28:03] <+pearred> my bard is the most boring class to play
[2022-12-17 17:28:04] <LunarKitsune> i tried bard and i did not like it
[2022-12-17 17:28:05] <$Syed9857> HEH
[2022-12-17 17:28:06] <marlonerrrr> I blamed myself why I did not made 5 alts support
[2022-12-17 17:28:14] <+joshstation2> some dps shpuld have like a sup build
[2022-12-17 17:28:14] <+MASx89> michael jackson?
[2022-12-17 17:28:14] <+loa_goofy> u dont play a support , u cant expect a Support
[2022-12-17 17:28:15] <%Eunactes> mj is in jailge peepoJail
[2022-12-17 17:28:15] <%killerjoker123> MJ is imprisoned
[2022-12-17 17:28:16] <idontlikethis8> i looking for supp for g5 6 for 5h now
[2022-12-17 17:28:17] <aplusvic> monkaW
[2022-12-17 17:28:17] <Avenuee2> i hate playing my bard alt
[2022-12-17 17:28:18] <%capy88> NOTED play support get a bugatti
[2022-12-17 17:28:18] <kiiimchy> imagine forcing yourself to play support just to join lobbies faster KEKW
[2022-12-17 17:28:18] <mmayhem7> people should try to play supports because 99% of the dps alts do not have the investment necessary to carry their weight in content
[2022-12-17 17:28:20] <%sta1os> peepoJail
[2022-12-17 17:28:20] <Jimotthy> On my 1520 Blade I joined a valtan hm group that said no reapers in the title to tell them that they're a dick for gatekeeping then left kekw
[2022-12-17 17:28:24] <FamiMisaki> MJailge
[2022-12-17 17:28:35] <VanillaRaspberries> i like playing my supports but not so much that i'll make multiple of the same class
[2022-12-17 17:28:39] <+LIMlT_> @Jimotthy neato
[2022-12-17 17:28:39] <+NotGrisah> my main is pally and got a alt bard. Might even drop my 1460 LM to make 1 more pally/bard
[2022-12-17 17:28:49] <+Tabsz> @ATK Is artist even good?
[2022-12-17 17:28:52] <+joshstation2> a support arcana that gives card efects to the party would be so cool imo
[2022-12-17 17:28:58] <Claaay69> lobby title: "Lf 2 supps. Willing to pay 5000g."
[2022-12-17 17:28:58] <+imjohnlol> id play more supports if they had more supports to choose from but only having pally and bard....thats all im gonna make
[2022-12-17 17:29:04] <CsanadT> @Jimotthy doing God's work BASED
[2022-12-17 17:29:14] <+MrEricFail> if i get declined too many times on my alt, i make a group on my main and put LoS 30 only in Title ( i got LoS 30 already)
[2022-12-17 17:29:15] <$Syed9857> @imjohnlol i agree 100%
[2022-12-17 17:29:20] <%capy88> @Jimotthy cause gatekeeping is bullshit...i have seen arcanas and reapers perform way better than wannabe zerks and such
[2022-12-17 17:29:20] <explosion956> @ATK when is artist coming out planing on main swapping
[2022-12-17 17:29:31] <BogDamnIt> The gatekeeping is worse not because the game is very grindy (i.e. takes a long time and effort to progress), but because it has real money pay to progress.
[2022-12-17 17:29:31] <+LIMlT_> I'd play supports more if they did at least 7m trixion dps
[2022-12-17 17:29:44] <ilkeidz> @claaay69  in eu supp alliance formed again and wanted to get paid 40k for G1G6 clear
[2022-12-17 17:29:44] <mmayhem7> @capy88 zerks are gatekept even more harshly than arcana and reaper
[2022-12-17 17:29:45] <sanefield_> @LIMlT_ djackzSmile
[2022-12-17 17:29:49] <ilkeidz> its crazy
[2022-12-17 17:29:53] <kiiimchy> @MrEricFail thats very delusional buddy KEKW
[2022-12-17 17:29:57] <ismellteletubby> @ATK is there hope they will announce the removal of pheons for some items on LOAON ?
[2022-12-17 17:30:02] <%capy88> @mmayhem7 they do?
[2022-12-17 17:30:07] <Claaay69> @ilkeidz wait really? no shot
[2022-12-17 17:30:14] <FamiMisaki> COPIUM
[2022-12-17 17:30:18] <+MrEricFail> @kiiimchy i just show them all how stupid gatekeeping is
[2022-12-17 17:30:19] <daxon6> @ismellteletubby nope
[2022-12-17 17:30:20] <+Excoupe7> they will never remove pheons lmao KEKW
[2022-12-17 17:30:24] <mmayhem7> @capy88 yes, reapers and arcana get rejected for not having gear/levels/gems, ive seen juiced zerkers get rejected
[2022-12-17 17:30:27] <VanillaRaspberries> @ismellteletubby they already removed them from all of our accounts last month KEKW
[2022-12-17 17:30:32] <Chidori_97> lets goo
[2022-12-17 17:30:32] <LunarKitsune> just support by doing lots of DPS boss cant hurt your party if its dead KEKW
[2022-12-17 17:30:34] <JustOneDuck_> Sharpshooter becomes the best class COPIUM
[2022-12-17 17:30:35] <%sta1os> Artist don't have to spend more than 1 bubble for healing

[2022-12-17 17:30:45] <Jimotthy> @capy88 yup thats why gatekeeping by class/ilvl/roster lvl are the dumbest things. I understand if someone is like 3x3 or has low gems, cuz that directly equates to lower damage, but assuming someone is unskilled because of class or roster is just stupid
[2022-12-17 17:30:48] <ilkeidz> @claaay69  a static member of a streamer i watch  left the static to do it
[2022-12-17 17:30:52] <marlonerrrr> i hope you can live stream on event tho
[2022-12-17 17:30:54] <+joshstation2> buff soulfist
[2022-12-17 17:30:54] <$Syed9857> are there things you dont think will be in loa on
[2022-12-17 17:30:54] <+robocop1382> Why do people have the gatekeep mentality instead of who cares let’s just get the raid done
[2022-12-17 17:31:11] <ismellteletubby> I will make sure to bring my hopium bag, ty <3
[2022-12-17 17:31:30] <+TragicBlast> what is that pet? is so cutee
[2022-12-17 17:31:34] <Kluzien> I've never once avoided jail by having more damage tbh
[2022-12-17 17:31:43] <Seanthedemiurge> because nobody likes to get jailed
[2022-12-17 17:31:47] <kiiimchy> @robocop1382 yes lets simple clear the raid with a full rainbow stats no gems no cards player's KEKW
[2022-12-17 17:31:47] <+joshstation2> the thing is that youe gatekeep low ilvl chars to bait in supports
[2022-12-17 17:31:50] <mmayhem7> @Kluzien ive been jailed from having way too low dps on clown
[2022-12-17 17:31:53] <Seanthedemiurge> but sometimes the gatekeep is over the top
[2022-12-17 17:31:53] <ilkeidz> @robocop1382  sometime gatekeepinf is good, for example people who enter  in exp party when they aint  and troll /jail the raid
[2022-12-17 17:32:27] <Kluzien> @mmayhem7 then just do more damage its easy
[2022-12-17 17:32:28] <$Syed9857> yeah its hard to tell if someone is gonna jail you no matter what their gear or stats are
[2022-12-17 17:32:28] <yunyunku> i dont want to play with someone who doesnt care gear KEKW
[2022-12-17 17:32:31] <ilkeidz> experienced it on reaper its not fun
[2022-12-17 17:32:32] <LeumasIX> they should have a mech simulator in trixion for new players
[2022-12-17 17:32:37] <%Marcey97> But you cant tell how good someone is from looking at their gear so you just take the stronger char
[2022-12-17 17:32:38] <%capy88> i dont mind wiping if ppl show progress after it
[2022-12-17 17:32:39] <LeumasIX> a place to practice random mechs for each boss
[2022-12-17 17:32:45] <%+mentaI___> uptime > gear anyways
[2022-12-17 17:32:51] <arrowned> people still consttantly proc bleedd stacks in valtan its unreal
[2022-12-17 17:32:58] <Jimotthy> I had a 1515 GL in Cal that didnt counter once and only taunted twice KEKL

[2022-12-17 17:33:00] <CsanadT> @LeumasIX not a lot of mchs are solo
[2022-12-17 17:33:08] <+robocop1382> Any content can be done with rainbow stats and 1 engraving
[2022-12-17 17:33:12] <mmayhem7> gunlancer is a god in brel though, I would take one over any other dps class
[2022-12-17 17:33:15] <%+mentaI___> i mean we have procel and mario
[2022-12-17 17:33:18] <kiiimchy> @LeumasIX people were suggesting that for years in korea, but it wont happen
[2022-12-17 17:33:19] <Seanthedemiurge> u dont need as much damage as people make it out to be
[2022-12-17 17:33:24] <Claaay69> i mean raid leaders gotta do their job like to make the raid smooth ya know, but yeah
[2022-12-17 17:33:26] <+robocop1382> Saint has already proved that but saint is a skilled player
[2022-12-17 17:33:44] <%capy88> i needed more practice in G3 dodging saws and hooks than acutally doing the mechanics LUL
[2022-12-17 17:33:45] <CsanadT> YEP

[2022-12-17 17:33:52] <xXValkyrie> yeah i play piano classes kek
[2022-12-17 17:33:52] <+loa_goofy> Lookin at skills is no excuse to be bad at mechs
[2022-12-17 17:34:05] <%とうふのみそ汁 (111kagura)> Dentge Play like this
[2022-12-17 17:34:11] <Amir_0_O_> I do that on new charachters only
[2022-12-17 17:34:18] <%capy88> @とうふのみそ汁 looks painful
[2022-12-17 17:34:19] <Jimotthy> its like looking at your keyboard and typing KEKL
[2022-12-17 17:34:27] <ilkeidz> @robocop1382  saint is saint, the average dps player that has 0 uptime on dps. cant do  it even being 1600 on kakul
[2022-12-17 17:34:28] <%+mentaI___> dont need to look at skills during mechs, since they often just require standing somewhere
[2022-12-17 17:34:39] <CsanadT> @Jimotthy I do that Madge
[2022-12-17 17:34:42] <firstnewtimer> I look at it all
[2022-12-17 17:34:57] <firstnewtimer> just for cd management
[2022-12-17 17:35:09] <%Marcey97> people wanna get that cruel fighter
[2022-12-17 17:35:15] <Jimotthy> @Jimotthy Denting KEKW
[2022-12-17 17:35:29] <$Syed9857> yeah like 110 mech in brel was so much easier when ppl stopped greeding
[2022-12-17 17:35:42] <+imjohnlol> it seems like most ppl dont look at the floor and minimap lmao just trying to zerg boss
[2022-12-17 17:36:18] <mmayhem7> its hard to keep track of your dps rotation, position, specific mech patterns, and tracking boss hp bar
[2022-12-17 17:36:19] <%sta1os> look and dodge first
[2022-12-17 17:36:33] <%sta1os> then you'll know boss openings
[2022-12-17 17:36:41] <Travistheman425> it's like league. got to have map awareness
[2022-12-17 17:36:42] <+imjohnlol> we had an issue in brel 4 last night bc nobody is looking at the minimap to stay near their assigned colors
[2022-12-17 17:36:44] <Claaay69> feels bad when i just got 20 stacks on surge but mechanic starts
[2022-12-17 17:36:47] <$Syed9857> also esther shandi is so nice to use
[2022-12-17 17:36:48] <aiuanacry> I see it more like a design flaw than anything, majority of boss mechanics seem to be focused on dmg so much to the point where when you look at how many engraving exist and how the ones used are a small number of them, same with stats where only 3 count pretty much. It's like fillers in anime. If they made a boss where dmg cannot skip mechanics it would change things a lot.
[2022-12-17 17:36:59] <+trise5> @travistheman425 not that much
[2022-12-17 17:37:11] <ilkeidz> i'd predere map to be bottom right corner KEKW
[2022-12-17 17:37:23] <sanefield_> true
[2022-12-17 17:37:32] <just1ceex> ATK yes tell ppl that its not the idea to jump on boss's head all the time and smash your keys ;d
[2022-12-17 17:37:35] <h4zchel> Dota Pog
[2022-12-17 17:37:45] <ilkeidz> too much league played and i continue looking bot right but nothing there KEKW
[2022-12-17 17:37:46] <binja12345> imagine we can customize UI :O
[2022-12-17 17:37:48] <%+mentaI___> just use tab map
[2022-12-17 17:37:50] <+zombdale> !drop
[2022-12-17 17:37:59] <FamiMisaki> KEKG
[2022-12-17 17:38:06] <+TragicBlast> lost ark community often dont follow common ssense
[2022-12-17 17:38:07] <yunyunku> it is kinda annoying that we dont have much flexibility of UI
[2022-12-17 17:38:08] <+TragicBlast> xd
[2022-12-17 17:38:10] <+loa_goofy> Common sense is not so common tho
[2022-12-17 17:38:17] <Jimotthy> common sense aint all that common Dentge
[2022-12-17 17:38:17] <+Defiant_Lights> Wait you dont jump on boss head and smash keys?
[2022-12-17 17:38:20] <just1ceex> ATK the problem is not a common sense ... everyone is obsesed with mvp screen ...
[2022-12-17 17:38:30] <%+midclassbrian> smashing keys works for my SH tho
[2022-12-17 17:38:31] <%capy88> but lost ark is pretty harsh when it comes to mistakes in mechanics though xD
[2022-12-17 17:38:40] <+Defiant_Lights> Back to the lab for me.
[2022-12-17 17:38:47] <thesuplix> I always do dps callouts on my party
[2022-12-17 17:38:58] <Claaay69> smashing keys on my reaper is kinda nice
[2022-12-17 17:39:06] <%+mentaI___> I mean depends on party
[2022-12-17 17:39:10] <%+mentaI___> if its expert party sure
[2022-12-17 17:39:12] <LunarKitsune> league has prepared me for that KEKW
[2022-12-17 17:39:15] <+TragicBlast> Lost ark is a very mechanic heavy game which is why i love it. and there are ALWAYS ppl trying to make ways of not doing them Sadge
[2022-12-17 17:39:15] <mmayhem7> my static cant even do the stupid orange orbs correctly on g2 KEKW
[2022-12-17 17:39:17] <$Syed9857> the problem with NA tho is that you can get EAC error during important mech and its no one's fault
[2022-12-17 17:39:25] <just1ceex> Claaay69 its nice to do it when u should and to stop when u should stop :)
[2022-12-17 17:39:44] <Claaay69> @TragicBlast i mean its nice to skip mechs too
[2022-12-17 17:39:44] <%+mentaI___> expecting people to not make mistakes in prog is unreasonable
[2022-12-17 17:39:45] <+TragicBlast> when u do a mechanic right it feels so satisfying
[2022-12-17 17:39:48] <+TragicBlast> imo
[2022-12-17 17:40:02] <Kurubanane> yumytvWave
[2022-12-17 17:40:07] <mmayhem7> yeah it either goes perfectly super fast or it bricks early and everything goes to the toilet
[2022-12-17 17:40:10] <%lostsoulz1010> atkRave
[2022-12-17 17:40:15] <firstnewtimer> @ATK I've seen you play artist a fair amount of time, I was wondering does the shield amount from her skill depend on the distance from your teammate
[2022-12-17 17:40:22] <%+midclassbrian> ya man clutched g2 last night, last one alive for like 30 hp lines
[2022-12-17 17:40:27] <Travistheman425> how can you tell what direction the Dimond is going to shot from?
[2022-12-17 17:40:28] <%+midclassbrian> felt gooood
[2022-12-17 17:40:30] <just1ceex> YESSS not to smash your keyboard and tell after that IM THE BEST I HAVE DONE THE MOST DMG
[2022-12-17 17:40:45] <just1ceex> The idea of the game is teamwork ...
[2022-12-17 17:40:47] <BigFatLoBao> HUH
[2022-12-17 17:40:47] <+robocop1382> Is it good time to play again? I stopped playing my account at 1540

[2022-12-17 17:41:00] <%+the_pikahu> Noted
[2022-12-17 17:41:00] <firstnewtimer> ahh so distance doesn't matter as long I splash them thanks
[2022-12-17 17:41:06] <Avenuee2> all the way to g3 was so easy but g4 is Despairge
[2022-12-17 17:41:17] <just1ceex> Lol u dont get it .. ofc is about doing dmg on cd skills
[2022-12-17 17:41:23] <+imjohnlol> u know with lack of supports at least on nae...is it a bad idea to just create a second build with a bit more defense so the party can be 4x dps?
[2022-12-17 17:41:31] <just1ceex> but its about doing it properly
[2022-12-17 17:41:40] <firstnewtimer> I see I see
[2022-12-17 17:41:40] <p3rry666> Is that one for meter gain too?

[2022-12-17 17:42:18] <mmayhem7> @imjohnlol tbh not having a support bricks a lot of classes that rely on yearning speed, not just about survival
[2022-12-17 17:42:19] <just1ceex> and then the better geared person or the one that can do more dmg do more because of the meta or what is it by mean i understand what the devs made
[2022-12-17 17:42:21] <everri47> hey everyone newbie here, how did he get that lightning aura and that automatic falling meteor?
[2022-12-17 17:42:29] <%+midclassbrian> any tips on what 4th engraving to get on pally? im gonna push it to 1475 for clown soon
[2022-12-17 17:42:34] <+HappyBoys> WideBorpaSpin

[2022-12-17 17:43:03] <p3rry666> But wine plays spec pala

[2022-12-17 17:43:34] <+Chromitus> is dps artist at least slightly better than dps bard or pally?
[2022-12-17 17:43:34] <just1ceex> ATK do ppl in corea may DPS paladin :D I have been with one DPS paladin in Argos raid ;D
[2022-12-17 17:43:43] <just1ceex> Korea*

[2022-12-17 17:43:51] <ismellteletubby> She looks really fun, especially when jumping around and shielding everyone
[2022-12-17 17:43:54] <mmayhem7> @imjohnlol that'd be really scuffed though, whoever swapped would have their dps tank to nothing
[2022-12-17 17:44:12] <@^StreamElements> Check out Mobalytics Brelshaza raid guides here - https://moba.lol/3VXtjnu
[2022-12-17 17:44:36] <%+weirdflavour> does she have big damge buffs like bard/pala or is she mid?

[2022-12-17 17:45:14] <harune___________________> Im so tired, just finished downvoting the daily Atk hate reddit thread ResidentSleeper
[2022-12-17 17:45:27] <FamiMisaki> I just walk around when he does that unless its Phase 2 KEKL
[2022-12-17 17:45:32] <$Syed9857> its also nice bc you can use it for blue freeze mech
[2022-12-17 17:45:36] <+TragicBlast> @TheOnlyOneGerd but u do feel the swiftness gain tho
[2022-12-17 17:45:43] <mmayhem7> gl crushes prokel in pvp mode with bash spam

[2022-12-17 17:46:04] <thesuplix> I find prokel pretty easy, you just hace to know when to dps, he has a lot of windows
[2022-12-17 17:46:10] <Amir_0_O_> @mmayhem7 really? my friends is having a hard time doing dmg on his GL main
[2022-12-17 17:46:11] <%+mentaI___> whats the ETA on thaemine
[2022-12-17 17:46:12] <$Syed9857> i didnt think BT would be good for prokel but im dead wrong now lol
[2022-12-17 17:46:16] <FamiMisaki> getting cornered when that mech happens is deadly
[2022-12-17 17:46:31] <Edot_KH> any helpful tips for a bard in my static to kill shapes faster in G3. he's been unable to get all 3 in time before mechanic triggers
[2022-12-17 17:46:37] <mmayhem7> @mmayhem7 hes tougher during pve mode, but in pvp mode you cancel every single pattern with bash and surge or stinger follow up
[2022-12-17 17:46:38] <FamiMisaki> Just stay focused on the goal, King. Kill his ass
[2022-12-17 17:46:43] <UltimaBlank> @Edot_KH use a bomb
[2022-12-17 17:46:53] <unsolved_73> grab catches me off guard sometimes
[2022-12-17 17:47:00] <+jeef223> feel like best tip is you dont have to stay inside the wholetime, you can reset going out then back in
[2022-12-17 17:47:03] <+surse1337> Prokel on my RE blade and FI WD feels bad... maybe I lack practice though :-/
[2022-12-17 17:47:08] <Edot_KH> @UltimaBlank tried that too

[2022-12-17 17:47:33] <+TragicBlast> do u think the next class is another specialist?
[2022-12-17 17:47:37] <kiiimchy> @ATK can u only go out from prokel after your team gets his head to 0x HP?
[2022-12-17 17:47:44] <%+chad_3005> I need more time in prokel too
[2022-12-17 17:47:52] <%sta1os> I hate being off screen on prokel to outrange the spears and then he does a pattern I can't see and react to
[2022-12-17 17:48:00] <%+chad_3005> 10000 hours in prokel then i will master him :)
[2022-12-17 17:48:02] <kolobodroid> next class Will be alchemist
[2022-12-17 17:48:18] <mmayhem7> weirdest thing was one of my guildies was doing prokel and he died to a clone, then i popped in and instadied to the clone + him
