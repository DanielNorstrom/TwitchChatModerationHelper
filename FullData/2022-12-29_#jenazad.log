[2022-12-29 08:57:53] <steardream> !yulha
[2022-12-29 08:57:53] <^Nightbot> Yulha is currently popular because 1: She has a 100% provoke on her S1 (krau does not) 2: her S2 lets her full cleanse + gives herself a barrier AND cr push, which essentially guarantees she gets her S3 off at low hp (krau is worthless vs debuffs) 3: her S3 ignores all damage share (including arrowell's escort) + heals her if it kills. She is a solid answer to currently popular units like Lhc, adin, riolet, etc due to how easy it is for her to kill them with her S3

[2022-12-29 11:13:49] <azuresusanoo97> ppl who main this game usually recommend you pull weapons if it's for a character you really like and plan to main
[2022-12-29 11:13:56] <topheavyzer0> yeah this game is pure skill-based. You can clear the highest difficulty with base rank characters as long as you're good
[2022-12-29 11:14:00] <hero_oftheend> 5 star weapons are  ok for most characters but the 6 stars are just the best options

[2022-12-29 11:32:17] <topheavyzer0> @falcon7201 Riot was independent before tencent bought them. LoL is also their biggest money maker so there's no way they're gonna remove pvp in a MOBA game

[2022-12-29 21:54:05] <^Nightbot> Specter Tenebria is at the top of every list I see and she completely deserves it. The dark tyrant that requests us lower level humans to kiss her feet. Little did she know I am excited to get the honor to even get close to her spectacular feet. Would I not only kiss her feet but I would personally clean each of her toes by sucking on each one until she is satisfied with the result. I can imagine the smell of roses from her feet as I lick in between her toenails.
[2022-12-29 21:56:49] <%teevivi> !yulha
[2022-12-29 21:56:49] <^Nightbot> Yulha is currently popular because 1: She has a 100% provoke on her S1 (krau does not) 2: her S2 lets her full cleanse + gives herself a barrier AND cr push, which essentially guarantees she gets her S3 off at low hp (krau is worthless vs debuffs) 3: her S3 ignores all damage share (including arrowell's escort) + heals her if it kills. She is a solid answer to currently popular units like Lhc, adin, riolet, etc due to how easy it is for her to kill them with her S3
