[2022-12-23 00:19:33] <dyno3570> sorry I'm still pretty noob at this game. is 545 BP ammo horrible or just all 545 ammo/ guns bad?

[2022-12-23 00:19:53] <%scapegoat613> BP is bad, BS and 7N40 is best
[2022-12-23 00:19:54] <%bobert557> 545 is just a smaller rifle caliber is all
[2022-12-23 00:19:58] <%doinkbadoink> BS is decent

[2022-12-23 01:03:27] <+Topic_TW> @polestarfps I would check to make sure your ram is running at the correct speed, and try not to max all the settings in game. It’s not necessary. Pretty solid hardware though.

[2022-12-23 01:03:40] <Abel_Jo> Zaptzz thats enough RAM to run tarkov decently, and you can run Tarkov with an older graphics card since the game is heavier on your CPU and RAM all i can say

[2022-12-23 16:48:47] <%Da_Dush> @alexibear20 what about Inertia vs no inertia @WillerZ ?
[2022-12-23 16:48:48] <%Ganked_Gamer> Agreed. The flea makes it too easy.

[2022-12-23 16:49:12] <Wulfgar_RED> I wish flea would be blocked not by level but days since wipe. eg no flea for 3 weeks
[2022-12-23 16:49:15] <%mattplays10k> just to roleplay as batman?

[2022-12-23 16:49:16] <zuka100kapas> they added streets already?
[2022-12-23 16:49:22] <%+OG_Jerm> I rarely used flea market this wipe and I had way more. Having to PVP for gear and weapons made it a lot more fun
[2022-12-23 16:49:23] <+Landon7K> what happened to gamma
[2022-12-23 16:49:29] <%siegetanker> ALSO NODDERS
[2022-12-23 16:49:34] <%peckboy1234> tarkov was better when u could buy everything in flea now it sucks u have to grind to unlock all traders to enjoy playing

[2022-12-23 16:49:57] <K3viN3T> What do you think about the game progressively getting harder instead of easier?
[2022-12-23 16:49:57] <%alexibear20> I’m happy they made you actually have to reload mags. Not the instant reload you use to be able to do
[2022-12-23 16:49:57] <Riann0n> wipe next thurs

[2022-12-23 16:50:33] <%Ganked_Gamer> The one thing the flea -has- done is help with ratting pace. People who can just buy more gear with no problem run around and make the noise. Without it, back to camping in corners of popular traffic areas
[2022-12-23 16:50:36] <+Landon7K> go puke

[2022-12-23 17:08:30] <%z1y0n> i found a video on how to fix frame drops on ADS and now ergo feels irrelevant literally feels like a diff game get an average extra 15-20fps per run
[2022-12-23 17:08:41] <%DaWigSplitta> I remember getting that kitted AK for xmas and I was addicted. lol like 5 wipes ago.
