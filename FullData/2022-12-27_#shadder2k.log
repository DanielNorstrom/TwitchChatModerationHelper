[2022-12-27 18:57:50] <nimbuscloako1> bodyshot trigger?
[2022-12-27 18:57:51] <$accuaro> you can aim assist a few ways, you can make it obvious or not
[2022-12-27 18:57:52] <%+General_M_Panda> it's always the hanzo cheating
[2022-12-27 18:57:54] <jopoglist1> his aiming just doesn't seem natural
[2022-12-27 18:57:57] <$accuaro> you can also set it to head shot or not

[2022-12-27 18:58:17] <kenny_the_bearded_snek> a t500 player would not play like that so its cheating
