[2022-12-30 00:01:36] <+sirbiggusdiccus> @punch_mcjudochop if another player scav shoots you, and they actually have to hit you not miss, you can then shoot back or if you see them shoot 1 of your friends you can kill them and not lose scav karma
[2022-12-30 00:01:41] <+Overcast22> Nooooo

[2022-12-30 00:02:25] <+Pelti> I quite miss proper twitch drop times. Now you barely have time to reach the legendary drops.. 12hrs to watch 10hrs or have I misunderstood how it works?
[2022-12-30 00:02:25] <+Itima_> do you have too restart the client to change the audio?
[2022-12-30 00:02:31] <+haaaake> They really changed out their entire audio system and just didn‚Äôt update half the maps to it didn‚Äôt they haha

[2022-12-30 00:09:12] <+Overcast22> Sacriel made a great idea a few wipes ago that you should be able to freely trade anything to someone that you‚Äôve done 10 raids with, as it would make it almost impossible for anyone to profit off of that. @klean

[2022-12-30 01:04:03] <+Sinewave> Taxpayer66 Are you new on Twitch? That's a common thing, Streamers are responsible for their chat and if they can't moderate then yeah.
[2022-12-30 01:04:10] <%KrackinWise313> Thats kinda the standard in English speaking channels
[2022-12-30 01:04:13] <%Joedafruterman> Yeah, aqui solo hablamos ingles.... just kidding

[2022-12-30 01:05:36] <+Sinewave> Taxpayer66 I mean, if you were timed out and that's the extent of it - no big deal right?
[2022-12-30 01:05:37] <zilthemill> @Taxpayer66 it's understandable to feel insulted at first, but it's nothing personal, they just cant moderate if they dont know the language

[2022-12-30 01:05:53] <Parallax_> @Taxpayer66 since they don't speak Russian they can't verify if that's what you said. It may have been innocent, but they have to purge what they can't translate on the spot
[2022-12-30 01:06:03] <+Bangbangchickenwangzz> I missed it did you kill santa?

[2022-12-30 01:07:24] <%KevinSredz> @Taxpayer66 yeah it doesnt really matter what the situation was. If mods see non-english, and there is a rule, its likely they will remove the message. Just how it is

[2022-12-30 02:27:41] <page_one_> it's just unfortunate going to this after playing dark and darker lol
[2022-12-30 02:27:41] <ImTheWilliam> the good thing about long queues is you can listen to the menu music KEKW
[2022-12-30 02:27:45] <@%JaxPC> also, when you get servers you're getting a contact with the provider, and that contract isn't something that can be changed day by day. you're stuck paying for servers at least for another month
[2022-12-30 02:27:48] <NuggiesOG> ive been watching you play this for years. its cool to see how much the game has progressed
[2022-12-30 02:27:56] <%$Deezil_Wood> @MusterCookie not missing much, I got a bottle of beer and some bolts lol
[2022-12-30 02:28:02] <+MakSmooth> i feel like even with binuraul sound off my frames dropped anyone else?
[2022-12-30 02:28:02] <@%dabsNbrews> yeah its pretty dope

[2022-12-30 02:28:30] <ImTheWilliam> LOL
[2022-12-30 02:28:31] <+The_Lord_Kara> I would disagree, as some exposure to this. An MSA with operational addendums and major entities like AWS you can scale and descale quickly, with  agility and at a decent cost basis.
[2022-12-30 02:28:40] <OGWello> my drop % hasn't moved in a bit
[2022-12-30 02:28:41] <xLachie> gimme dem legs

[2022-12-30 02:37:01] <siddo__> the scrappyness that is supposed to be early game tarkov dissapears so quick. i feel like at the beginning most of the time youd have to scrape together a kit instead of being able to always run the same one

[2022-12-30 02:40:13] <siddo__> @EricWitaK it would help a bit in terms of general skill level but most of it wont matter that much no
[2022-12-30 02:41:15] <siddo__> yeah agreed, right now you can play for 48 hours straight if you want to and be so far ahead of everyone else, would be cool if there was some sort of soft lock on progression to keep most players along the same lines
[2022-12-30 02:41:32] <+Sinewave> EricWitaK A lot of things can be transferrable in gaming - being under tense conditions, reaction speed, general aim mechanics (point and shoot), spacial awareness, etc etc. Game doesn't need to necessarily be 1:1 to have useful hours elsewhere.

[2022-12-30 02:41:57] <+GL0CKenspeil> @siddo__ i think the progression gap is so wide youd have some players bored waiting for others to catch up and some getting steam rolled still
[2022-12-30 02:42:01] <renodemron> in fact you're the only person I watch every wipe, hardly anyone tries stuff and puts effort into finding their own style of play

[2022-12-30 02:42:56] <Gogh> You add a duo or trio like that and there's almost no chance to wipe them
[2022-12-30 02:43:11] <siddo__> yeah thats kinda what i mean, people being able to rush tasks will always happen unless you lock tasks, but limiting the gear level would help a lot
[2022-12-30 02:43:15] <$GreenShaDow42> i think i played a dozen raids last wipe, got killed on like day 4 against a 3 man with slicks altyns, called it good after that

[2022-12-30 02:43:41] <+Uranium_Bullet> Has Nikita confirmed if wipes will still be a thing after "release" (whenever that is)? Think the game's biggest problem to tackle long-term is keeping players around without relying on wipes.
[2022-12-30 02:43:56] <ImTheWilliam> yeah I agree, traders should only sell basic shit
[2022-12-30 02:43:56] <xDiiivx> yep, too much available at traders. Imo skills still do too much

[2022-12-30 02:47:53] <+GL0CKenspeil> @siddo__ possibly, im just eager for core gameplay changes
[2022-12-30 02:48:03] <naoii__> i mean while sittin' for so long at one time

[2022-12-30 02:48:38] <+Sinewave> I guess that's one benefit from looking at Dark and Darker, people will intentionally focus on running more PvE content to get loot/gear (but in a PvP environment) i.e. bosses or harder areas. It'd be interesting to see if Tarkov could somehow improve/tighten up the existing content to make it more viable.
[2022-12-30 02:48:53] <xDiiivx> monkaS where is he
[2022-12-30 02:48:56] <renodemron> imo items after lv 4 must be found in raids by killing bosses or farming a specific area, so that dedicated zones of interest are created for loot and not for pvp
[2022-12-30 02:49:01] <+MakSmooth> when is the UMP available?

[2022-12-30 02:50:45] <ImTheWilliam> @RealDankSlappyOG CPU load, unless you have a sound card
[2022-12-30 02:50:49] <siddo__> @RealDankSlappyOG dont know for sure but im guessing it weighs heavy on the CPU
[2022-12-30 02:50:54] <its_matija> @RealDankSlappyOG the sound processing probably uses a lot of cpu if id have to guess
[2022-12-30 02:50:58] <+Chungazoid> @RealDankSlappyOG Dunno but I turned it off and got 30 fps boost.
[2022-12-30 02:51:16] <NeLZi94> @RealDankSlappyOG it use a lot of cpu and tarkov use mainely the cpu to work

[2022-12-30 14:28:13] <@%SpottedTango> Meh, maybe he just doesn't know that the player can glitch out and show people obsurdly low viewcounts, like you originally had 0 viewers until like a minute ago for me.

[2022-12-30 14:28:36] <%Thewaterlord27> Might have announced it too early, before current events happened.
[2022-12-30 14:28:40] <yercules> i hope stalker 2 is not too arcady
[2022-12-30 14:28:45] <zero_vaas> all we can ask for is just a new stalker with a new engine

[2022-12-30 16:16:47] <+arananegra> sorry for the bad wording
[2022-12-30 16:16:55] <Tragicalzzz> i feel like most people going to play arena instead of tarkov
[2022-12-30 16:16:57] <@%+Sev07Sniper> I'd probably factor arena to be played a bit faster
[2022-12-30 16:17:09] <@%+Sev07Sniper> @Tragicalzzz nah, they're both gonna be quite handy side by side

[2022-12-30 16:17:54] <%+tactical_t_rex> just imagine the hardware that will be out in 15 years when this game is close to completion
[2022-12-30 16:17:56] <%+xLIQUIDMONKEYx> when tarkov full releases i will prob need an upgrade
[2022-12-30 16:18:04] <@%Mrshilka> so pushing EFT to use higher hardware wil push out much of the russian market

[2022-12-30 16:38:37] <+cykaq49> I guess is to just know when to play agressive or defensive, also being good and positioning
[2022-12-30 16:38:47] <+cykaq49> also don't be greedy

[2022-12-30 16:43:14] <@%Mrshilka> right back
[2022-12-30 16:43:15] <yeavo> I no longer believe loot in this game is pure RNG. I've concluded there is a backend algorithm that lowers item spawns needed by the players in raid for quests and upping them shortly after just to screw with players. I can barely find GasAns but once I've completed the task that needs them they'll spawn everywhere by boatloads.
[2022-12-30 16:43:21] <trapys> wow, that sucks. Why do people always know that shit 1 sec after its released..... just enjoy the experience

[2022-12-30 16:46:14] <Kindalhart> @Gelrandil at least*
[2022-12-30 16:46:36] <Gelrandil> Kindalhart ty!
[2022-12-30 16:46:36] <%PinkGuy_120> I wanna upgrade to 32GB but shit's expensive
[2022-12-30 16:46:45] <%od_raider> hey Klean, why don't you insure?
[2022-12-30 16:46:46] <+Y3arZer0> just got an rk-kprl key? is that good i havent played in 2 wipes
[2022-12-30 16:46:49] <@%Mrshilka> yeah you want 16 gigs 3200 as min
[2022-12-30 16:46:58] <zenmaster1112> 32 should be fine
[2022-12-30 16:47:04] <@%Mrshilka> 32 gig is tons
[2022-12-30 16:47:05] <veoko_> ram speed too. most people have good ram but don't turn on docp in their bios
[2022-12-30 16:47:06] <+blazinmonkey> @cykaq49 the game lives in your CPU there is no real difference between 16gm ram and 64gb of ram for this game
[2022-12-30 16:47:09] <%hr1amos> Watched smoke this morning it would be amazing if you two played this game together you‚Äôre both play immersive game style that I love . Always love the streams
[2022-12-30 16:47:13] <@%Mrshilka> just make sure its 3200 speed at least
[2022-12-30 16:47:15] <%+buttsu556> @klean same with CPU cache
[2022-12-30 16:47:16] <TrixieKat> kprl is great
[2022-12-30 16:47:19] <%Skullii> i upgrade my RAM for star citizen so much better now
[2022-12-30 16:47:26] <+BFGHouse> 16 to 32 is an upgrade for sure
[2022-12-30 16:47:29] <+cykaq49> @Klean Yeah, hes saying im crazy, the game eats only 9GBs of ram max on streets
[2022-12-30 16:47:30] <%RiftUnix> @veoko_ I understood half of what you said
[2022-12-30 16:47:30] <+Y3arZer0> awesome. random drop for the win

[2022-12-30 16:48:45] <@%Mrshilka> made grind harder
[2022-12-30 16:48:49] <+MaplePrism_> @cykaq49 Your CPU can be bottlenecked by your ram this is objectively wrong
[2022-12-30 16:48:51] <ThePrumos> so jaeger even more dificult ..
[2022-12-30 16:48:51] <%RiftUnix> But I‚Äôm also coming down from behind high all night playing this game
[2022-12-30 16:48:51] <%PinkGuy_120> ???
[2022-12-30 16:48:51] <%thall9179> @cykaq49 it couldnt hurt to have more than needed
[2022-12-30 16:48:51] <trapys> damn, standard players getting fucked :D
[2022-12-30 16:48:55] <@%Mrshilka> 16 gig is the gaming min now days
[2022-12-30 16:48:55] [Notification] TheKeg34 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 6 months!
[2022-12-30 16:48:55] <veoko_> @riftunix not all motherboards support fast ram by default. have to change setting so motherboard makes fast ram run fast :)
[2022-12-30 16:48:55] <+popps375> Yeah tarkov on my system uses around 22 gigs at peak so 32 in my case feels required or I get massive stuttering
[2022-12-30 16:48:55] <+cykaq49> @cykaq49 Like I said, the game only eats half of the game, still almost 50% left
[2022-12-30 16:48:55] <@%Mrshilka> thats base line for a gaming system
[2022-12-30 16:48:55] <+blazinmonkey> @cykaq49 yes it CAN be ... that isnt the casse for this particular piece of software tho
[2022-12-30 16:48:55] <%+TacticoolChopsticks> Had 16gigs of Ram and the game hovered around 15 gig usage. Recently upgraded to 32gigs and EFT takes about 19gigs now. Weird. Runs better though
[2022-12-30 16:48:56] <Ksanraizzz> thats a lot of rep
[2022-12-30 16:48:56] <ThePrumos> nikita wants to sell those eod's LUL
[2022-12-30 16:48:56] <%+succulenthamm> @Mrshilka min for everything now lol, 32gb min for gaming

[2022-12-30 16:49:04] <@%Mrshilka> few games will use anything close to 32 gigs
[2022-12-30 16:49:04] <%PinkGuy_120> 32 min for gaming? youre tripping
[2022-12-30 16:49:16] <@%Mrshilka> not while consoles are stillt he gaming baseline
[2022-12-30 16:49:17] <%RiftUnix> @veoko_ I learned something today
[2022-12-30 16:49:21] <@%+Sev07Sniper> @PinkGuy_120 depends what games you playu lol
[2022-12-30 16:49:24] <%+succulenthamm> @PinkGuy_120 not when you only main tarkov lol
[2022-12-30 16:49:24] <+BFGHouse> 32 is the future for gaming
[2022-12-30 16:49:32] <+cykaq49> @TacticoolChopsticks yo wtf?? it only takes like 8GBs of my 16, ain't no game nowdays taking 16 GBs
[2022-12-30 16:49:37] <%PinkGuy_120> @PinkGuy_120 ah that I understand
[2022-12-30 16:49:42] <+GL0CKenspeil> tarkov and scum are the only games that max my 16gb personally

[2022-12-30 16:50:07] <%BigHoss762> Hey @Klean, you should check out Black Rifle Coffee. It's really good coffee. Hahaha KEKW
[2022-12-30 16:50:09] <%+TacticoolChopsticks> COD takes up like 10 gigs max. But EFT wants it all man
[2022-12-30 16:50:11] <+tobytheshinobi> Need more deditated wam
[2022-12-30 16:50:11] <@%Mrshilka> fuck fallout 4 can gobble 674 gig with mods
[2022-12-30 16:50:13] <veoko_> @riftunix press ctrl shift esc and click ram, make sure speed at the bottom of task manager is what you want running. some motherboards will cap it at 2333 unless you change settings
[2022-12-30 16:50:14] <%+whomst_d_ve_ly_yaint_nt> i have 16 but no stuttering but would i get better frames if i upgrade to 32?
[2022-12-30 16:50:22] <%+succulenthamm> @BigHoss762 honestly, it's like bad coffee lol
[2022-12-30 16:50:26] <@%Mrshilka> @SirRuSc RuSc! my friend good to see you kleanWee
[2022-12-30 16:50:27] <ItsRajev> You should invest in a Chemex¬Æ Drop Coffee glass peice. It's by far one of the best/fastest ways to make coffee @klean take a look when you can!
[2022-12-30 16:50:35] <%PinkGuy_120> @Sev07Sniper yeah but saying 32 is the min is a stretch nonetheless
[2022-12-30 16:50:37] <yeavo> I can't run EFT with XMP abled. Every other game no problem but EFT and XMP cause BSoD for some reason. XMP disabled it runs fine.
[2022-12-30 16:50:46] <ItsRajev> yea!!! lol
[2022-12-30 16:50:49] <@%Mrshilka> he works for them confirmed lol
[2022-12-30 16:50:59] <@%Mrshilka> @ItsRajev we on to you lol
[2022-12-30 16:51:08] <Gelrandil> i had to upgrade my ram for job related stuff but yeah it definitely helped tarkov as well

[2022-12-30 16:51:16] <+BFGHouse> @yeavo download memtest, sounds like bad ram

[2022-12-30 16:51:28] <@%+Sev07Sniper> @PinkGuy_120 I think 32 shoudld be the like recommended at this point but minimum could be anything just all depends what you want to do
[2022-12-30 16:51:31] <d4nnnny> I got the AN/PVS-14 night vision monocular, not sure what to attach it too? anyone know?
[2022-12-30 16:51:44] <veoko_> @yeavo sometimes tarkov is like that. try a lower profile, e. g. if your max ram speed is 3600 try 3400 for xmp. can help with how tarkov is unoptimised
[2022-12-30 16:51:47] VIEWERS: 1¬†435
[2022-12-30 16:51:58] <+BFGHouse> @yeavo I'd seriously run memtest to confirm it's not hardware first, sounds like nothing else has stressed it
[2022-12-30 16:52:07] <@%Mrshilka> I still think 3200 speed ram is the sweet spot

[2022-12-30 16:53:57] <+BFGHouse> @yeavo You need to run the bios test of memtest you boot into, will need a usb stick
[2022-12-30 16:54:00] <%Lourio> @tactical_t_rex you're not the only one bruther :)
[2022-12-30 16:54:13] <@%Mrshilka> vpn for buying good way for your bank to lock you out
[2022-12-30 16:54:15] <+ReveralX> @PinkGuy_120 here is an example to understand how it works. Lets say windows minimum requirement is 4 gig ram, but you installing it with 2 gig ram.  it will still ruin, but it will load everything slower
[2022-12-30 16:54:16] <tigerking3> @Mrshilka you think my 3600, gtx 1660 could use 32 or should i just get better gpu
[2022-12-30 16:54:19] <%+whomst_d_ve_ly_yaint_nt> @LinkBling just move to bermuda ez

[2022-12-30 16:55:00] <%thechernobylgoat> @tactical_t_rex imo i think it was the game audio not sight on how klean killed that guy, could be wrong though

[2022-12-30 16:55:18] <Rawsick> @Klean how about a feature to panic drop an item like a cms while healing instead of putting it back away when cancelling it just drops to ground

[2022-12-30 16:56:21] <veoko_> @yeavo yea np the reason why i'm saying is bc the exact thing helped for me, even through 3600 xmp works for other games. sometimes ram will pass memtest but still have issues performing certain operations at higher clock speed. could be hardware could be way game makes hardware handle memory
[2022-12-30 16:56:37] <%+snake0720> @BigHoss762 hell yah brutherrrrr
[2022-12-30 16:56:51] <+Y3arZer0> intelligence still worth anything? I have it sitting in my inv
[2022-12-30 16:56:56] <+ReveralX> @PinkGuy_120 also like minimum requremet for lets say star citizen is 16 gig ram, and it will allocate 16-18 from 32 gig.  but if you only have 16 gig of ram, it will allocate 12 or less to make space for windows and other backround programs to work without issues
[2022-12-30 16:57:07] <@%Mrshilka> it will have uses as hideouts are upgraded
[2022-12-30 16:57:24] <+blazinmonkey> @Y3arZer0 sells well the merchants and still used for scav boxs - should be something you are picking up still... idk about holding on to
