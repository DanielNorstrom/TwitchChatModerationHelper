[2022-12-26 11:15:06] <GravesiteRapper> So I made a kid's dream come true today. I dressed up as Willy Wonka at his birthday and gave him a Wonka bar for his birthday! He had a Charlie and the Chocolate Factory themed party, and all he wanted was to meet Willy Wonka. So I made him so happy that he cried...it was so sweet.
