[2022-12-21 16:27:59] <%MegatonLink> there are openings, usually when he jumps, or dashes, if you dodge you can get a hit in. they stagger easily

[2022-12-21 18:38:38] <%MrNinja1234> it's because you take off so few days in general and you actually tell people you're taking off. someone like Hob takes off when he wants and does it a lot more
