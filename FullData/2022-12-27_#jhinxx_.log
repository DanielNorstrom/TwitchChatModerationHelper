[2022-12-27 20:29:47] <Tommicus> TikTok is geocentric so it depends on what time you upload for your area. typically somewhere between one and 6 is a good time to upload

[2022-12-27 23:26:54] <%yoshimitsu_89> They pump their food full of fat, sugar and salt to simulate their desensitized tongues to what they think is flavour
[2022-12-27 23:27:02] <%+Thiago_IHF> They're just lazy and don't see the difference between microwave or kettle water
[2022-12-27 23:27:12] <Kekahi_VT> Also I go crazy if my kitchen has dirty dishes in it.
[2022-12-27 23:27:19] <%reeks_of_havyk> I prefer to heat my water in the oven, put the stove on high with a skillet and dump my tea bags into the skillet and cook it until solid
[2022-12-27 23:27:20] <%SomeRandomTacoo> microwave water should only be for instant ramen or those mac and cheese cups
[2022-12-27 23:27:34] <%SomeRandomTacoo> Nitro brew and cold brew is where the coffe is at for me
[2022-12-27 23:27:37] <%SomeRandomTacoo> Tea is hot brew
[2022-12-27 23:27:40] <Blueshadow230> yeah, and even in coffee theres a huge difference between boiled and expresso machines

[2022-12-27 23:28:58] <%SomeRandomTacoo> @Beastkingcw it depends on tea brand.

[2022-12-27 23:29:05] <%Ziiltch> tbh, twin layer kettle for tea is great, can use top layer to heat the tea leaves to release the sroma before adding hot water GlitchNRG
