[2022-12-20 16:24:14] <+DanielMors> @skweefus jesus probably wasn't born on either day since it's just the reused date of a pagan fest lol
[2022-12-20 16:24:18] <@%Radolov> @deafgamer300 Yes. Go to Caelid and kill the dragon Greyoll with bleed. Use a gold pickled foot before it dies mikkaaPeek
[2022-12-20 16:24:20] <%Foblos> @skweefus most scholars actually think Jesus was born around April in the year 3 A.D.
[2022-12-20 16:24:26] <%OCaptainMyCapitan> @skweefus Im guessing its just tradition, has been like that in Finland for at least the past 43 years
[2022-12-20 16:24:29] <%brianthebroken85> @skweefus Well, probably because the Christmas stories happen at night...so Jesus was born maybe little past midnight..  Although, to be honest, Jesus wasn't exactly born in December at all...it's just set as that, but not his actual birth month.
[2022-12-20 16:24:32] <maru_illo> I hate the imps

[2022-12-20 20:14:57] <%Pordgy> @MattyArc204 no you're absolutely right, but inspiration can be taken from anywhere and christianity is one of the first comparisons that many authors reach for with world building

[2022-12-20 20:16:02] <Delagg> The problem with learning from video games is that you might get something like "All your base are belong to us" if you get a game that's been translated

[2022-12-20 21:08:45] <joyfulrogue> Well if it was a normal question they'd just ask it, wouldn't they? They KNOW they're being suss, that's why they ask for permission
[2022-12-20 21:08:48] <%TipherethCaesula> If the person feels the need to ask, it's because the person knows the question is not gonna be easy.
