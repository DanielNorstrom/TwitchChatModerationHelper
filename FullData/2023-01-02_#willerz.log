[2023-01-02 01:03:26] <justjeremy02> people don't seem to understand that not only is it WEEK ONE of wipe, but viewers are also perfectly capable of getting more than 7 legendary drops and at least twice that many rare and common drops over the course of the event. Imagine if the drops were as good as people expect? Early wipe would be over instantly.

[2023-01-02 18:15:52] <pirtzon> @WillerZ is there a difference btw a meta ADAR and a meta TX???

[2023-01-02 22:08:32] <@%OddBawZ> @smokedair When you load in the game puts everyone in the same coordinates then puts you at your spawns.  If someone shoots in the first 10-30 seconds of the game, desync still thinks you're all there still.

[2023-01-02 23:56:47] <+mallso> No you are wrong @BMacski just like how they named the country Mozambique after the Apex gun they named all sorts of guns after this game
[2023-01-02 23:56:51] <ahungrycoin> Nah tarkov inspired the multi billion dollar gun enterprise in usa
[2023-01-02 23:56:55] <Dinguth> Wheres the Samsung Sponsorship KappaCool
[2023-01-02 23:56:55] <SuperBurn94> 2060 just doesn’t make it
[2023-01-02 23:56:59] <+rbtrout> the players willerz kills are on 720p
[2023-01-02 23:57:01] <%+BMacski> @mallso okay you got me LUL

[2023-01-02 23:57:35] <+rbtrout> they are for special customers
[2023-01-02 23:57:42] <+Nate_Hatred> @SuperBurn94 you need a strong CPU and RAM combo for Tarkov, a 2060 is not *that* bad but it would surely struggle in 1440p
[2023-01-02 23:57:44] <%Reap3r1G> Yeah IDS and video feed are 720
[2023-01-02 23:57:50] <+mallso> Thank you, thank you now @BMacski give me 250000000 rubles

[2023-01-02 23:58:06] <%+BMacski> @mallso bruh i need the rub rubs too
[2023-01-02 23:58:09] <+OfficialBobert1693> I can run 1440p, but my screen won't let me enable it on Tarkov, it keeps defaulting to 1080p. Even tho I know it can run 1440p, how do I fix this?
[2023-01-02 23:58:15] <+MceeOG> !sens
