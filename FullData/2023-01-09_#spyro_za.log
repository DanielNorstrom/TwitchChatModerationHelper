[2023-01-09 09:22:00] <moonbr0> Warpath and Namor are interchangeable. It's a preference thing imo.
[2023-01-09 09:22:11] <%RC_Sev> Hi, Spyro. I was wondering, will you check out the next patch for Gwent for old times sake?
[2023-01-09 09:22:27] <+Jekkfje> warpath imo is better since you can play multiple units in it's lame whereas namor limits u to only him

[2023-01-09 09:23:33] <+Jekkfje> that's fair I guess it is just preference
[2023-01-09 09:23:52] <moonbr0> @Jekkfje Both have their benefits and both are equally as restrictive. Warpath makes it so that you are incentivized to commit heavily into 2 lanes and forget the third. That can back fire massively depending on the locations.

[2023-01-09 10:19:49] <UnrealSinglePlayer> In what ways would you suggest building this deck differently for folks with different cards to represent a more optimized gameplan? Or is this explicitly meant to only contain pool 1 stuff?
[2023-01-09 10:20:37] <Crayonfart_> this deck is full p1/p2
[2023-01-09 10:20:44] <UnrealSinglePlayer> I think everyone gets spectrum on the tutorial YEP

[2023-01-09 10:47:25] <%yeeth4> @SaboLiq they all are busted but leader is the one who got memed the most so yeah
[2023-01-09 10:47:27] <@%zubedoo> @Flash20 the way speero is going he will reach in no time KEKL
[2023-01-09 10:47:30] <+Flash20> so if you put in 8 hour days you should be there in no time
[2023-01-09 10:47:40] <inther4> best card for this deck is destroyer
[2023-01-09 10:47:45] <Iwilljoy> @SaboLiq Not true, Leader  is worst that this game has, but Aero is really broken tho

[2023-01-09 10:47:59] <+Benelioto> you don't gain CL by playtime, it's all quests
[2023-01-09 10:48:07] <Moysh85> how to farm CL if f2p?

[2023-01-09 10:48:24] <+Flash20> @BlackStarLightning to me it sounds horrid, but hes a streamer doing it for his job so it makes sense kind of
[2023-01-09 10:48:28] <SaboLiq> @yeeth4 you're right, it's the one that's most memed. But there are bigger problems than Leader. Unless you're not very good at the game there are ways to counter Leader and to preview that he's coming.
[2023-01-09 10:48:30] <@%zubedoo> @Moysh85 keep doing quests and season pass quests
[2023-01-09 10:48:35] <Moysh85> how much has spyro spent? lol
[2023-01-09 10:48:38] <@%zubedoo> and spend gold to get more quests before time

[2023-01-09 10:49:34] <SaboLiq> @Iwilljoy you're wrong mate, silver surfer decks are way worse than Leader. Even zoo decks counter Leader, you just need to have a little bit of IQ do preview and counter Leader.
[2023-01-09 10:50:22] <$xtskater> yall may not know this but spyro was a pretty good gwent player back in the day

[2023-01-09 10:51:17] <moonbr0> @SaboLiq This is true, but the problem with Leader isn't it's strength. The problem is it's design and execution. It fits into any deck, will usually always win if you are ahead, and just feels bad to lose to. It's flawed beyond it's power.
[2023-01-09 10:51:28] <Iwilljoy> deadpool so good

[2023-01-09 10:51:33] <%yeeth4> yeah brood and debrii are essential cards for patriot deck but you dont have any of them
[2023-01-09 10:51:42] <Iwilljoy> Easy 8 for 1
[2023-01-09 10:51:48] <swift167> you have the pass?
[2023-01-09 10:51:48] <inther4> @SaboLiq agree. leader is bad for the game imo

[2023-01-09 10:52:24] <+Jekkfje> yes
[2023-01-09 10:52:42] <maximus4realg> Spyro you went to infinite very fast. Any plans on Snap youtube vids?
[2023-01-09 10:52:43] <Emrino94> don't see the problem Clueless
[2023-01-09 10:52:53] <@%zubedoo> I am CL 959 or something and still didnt get Patriot KEKL
[2023-01-09 10:52:54] <bigfatloserboy> brood and debrii are not essential for patriot imo I got to infinite playing patriot without either of those cards but I did have Ultron tbf @ @yeeth4
[2023-01-09 10:53:07] <SaboLiq> @bigfatloserboy exactly but if you guys say that Leader is the biggest problem in the game why can't i say it is not? I'm just saying that on my climb to infinite i had way more problems with silver surfer decks than with decks with Leader (because Leader decks are easy to know and play around it)
[2023-01-09 10:53:10] VIEWERS: 322

[2023-01-09 10:54:00] <Iwilljoy> @SaboLiq I suggest that you dont understand what you talking about. Surfer countred Leader, but  thats it.

[2023-01-09 10:54:50] <bigfatloserboy> @SaboLiq In my opinion surfer decks are very telegraphed and I know how to play around them. My problem with leader is it's hard to play around leader without losing if they don't play leader when you're expecting them to it creates an unhealthy playstyle
[2023-01-09 10:54:57] <SaboLiq> @yeeth4 i don't play Leader and i don't like the card, i'm just saying there are bigger problems than Leader but Leader is more memed and that's it.

[2023-01-09 10:56:13] <Iwilljoy> ok Sadge
[2023-01-09 10:56:54] <moonbr0> Leader will get changed anyways, regardless of if it's the biggest problem or not. Players demand it, players complain, players will get it eventually.

[2023-01-09 12:10:10] <%steeldeity06> it's because sir the cards you get at pools are random. someone got leader before you or brood before you shit like that @spyro_za
[2023-01-09 12:10:12] <Hekmekk> what is your CL?
[2023-01-09 12:10:16] <BlackStarLightning> If you in pool one your probably not vsing pool 3 decks Kinda fair no
[2023-01-09 12:10:38] <SpacedOut715> you're*
[2023-01-09 12:10:41] <UnrealSinglePlayer> I think playing safe is fine most of the time, but when you're going against the same people you need to be careful about what kind of image you're giving them. When you retreat just because he could have the nuts and you don't he can bluff snap you more and more often
[2023-01-09 12:10:49] <UnrealSinglePlayer> those are just my two cents though

[2023-01-09 12:54:22] <UnrealSinglePlayer> For the most part, they don't want to have good bots in this game because having them win means that they're stealing cubes from a finite resource of them being exchanged between players
[2023-01-09 12:55:28] <tobimk4> I dont think they really want you to lose to bots at low collection level. you're supposed to have fun and get hooked at this point.
[2023-01-09 12:55:47] <tobimk4> later on the bots even cheat

[2023-01-09 13:04:24] <%crander47> Lots of decks have ways of pouring lots of points into multiple lanes
[2023-01-09 13:04:27] <UnrealSinglePlayer> the thing is Klaw isn't very good in high CL and neither is adding a textless 5 power unit clogging up ur lanes
[2023-01-09 13:04:32] <Hekmekk> its played in some decks with patriot

[2023-01-09 13:05:12] <Hekmekk> but you have to have space on the other location and its just 5 power
[2023-01-09 13:05:38] <UnrealSinglePlayer> it's one of those cards where in a vaccuum, it's very powerful, but in practice, it doesn't provide much

[2023-01-09 13:06:29] <UnrealSinglePlayer> @UnrealSinglePlayer Yeah, I'm just saying that it's not an auto-include in every single deck. It's a card you build around rather than being an instantly good pick

[2023-01-09 13:32:38] <RaunoSaul> theres like 1 patch a month but only 2 cards get +1 -2 power nothing much
[2023-01-09 13:33:05] <yepronos> this game is over
[2023-01-09 13:34:02] <ShinThanatos> No
[2023-01-09 13:34:02] <Iwilljoy> @Iwilljoy you already told that to me and I can agree, but still there so many obviously needed balance changes... How they can be so blind or lame i dont know. And they are not novice in card games

[2023-01-09 13:34:13] <ERB0L> i think the last patch did a good job
[2023-01-09 13:34:18] <UnrealSinglePlayer> to be fair you don't want to have cards be nerfed a lot in this game since getting them is a lot bigger of a commitment
[2023-01-09 13:34:27] <Hekmekk> Nerfing a card by 1 power or giving 1 power can have a really big impact
[2023-01-09 13:34:35] <UnrealSinglePlayer> nerfing a strong card makes all the purchase decisions leading up to it makes it a bad experience for the user
[2023-01-09 13:34:52] <coheran> is zabu broken?

[2023-01-09 14:13:13] <UnrealSinglePlayer> The fact that you'd have to spend that much money and even then you have to wait every day over the course of 6 weeks is high key ridiculous
[2023-01-09 14:13:55] <UnrealSinglePlayer> I understand where the devs are coming from with the "your collection is unique and special" mentality, but it gets really frustrating when you crawl at a snail's pace to do anything
[2023-01-09 14:14:02] <kr3du> gold is crazy expensive compared to the credits u get and also there is a set ammount of times that u can buy credits with gold per day, hence the 6 weeks
[2023-01-09 14:14:11] <kr3du> even p2w
[2023-01-09 14:14:20] <kekrotal> still better economy than hs

[2023-01-09 14:16:01] <hayoung> so many bots
[2023-01-09 14:16:20] <quantoll> @kekrotal Don't know about that, depending on your luck building competetive deck in snap can take way longer, especially if you want specific deck

[2023-01-09 15:30:25] <+ShdwRptr> @zkatom Doom is good but I prefer Ultron in the deck. The version I play doesn't clog the board much so Doom is usually less points
[2023-01-09 15:30:41] <zkatom> @ShdwRptr with Doom you can use Brood more effectively if you wish
[2023-01-09 15:30:51] <+Hotshot940> @zkatom I saw. He needs to refresh missions with it if he hasn’t already.

[2023-01-09 17:27:40] <+Shydigz> When is it best to snap ? when you know you will win?
[2023-01-09 17:28:00] <+Shydigz> if I have a super high win rate should I just snap asap?
[2023-01-09 17:28:12] <Iwilljoy> @Crayonfart_ and me since the first day of gwent
[2023-01-09 17:28:27] <+Shydigz> ya im only 82 im sure it'll get harder
[2023-01-09 17:28:35] <Hedhuntr000> snap based on how your turns look
[2023-01-09 17:28:58] <Hedhuntr000> yea at 82 you're generally still just turn 6 snapping

[2023-01-09 17:32:44] <+DaSlush> You could have played into the middle location and every card would be +3
