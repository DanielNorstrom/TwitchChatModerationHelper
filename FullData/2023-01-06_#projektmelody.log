[2023-01-06 04:15:32] <%Astraeria> Are you following our thoughts?
[2023-01-06 04:15:34] <$woofy1988> were they bone needles? How does one break needles in soft tissue?!

[2023-01-06 04:15:45] <+sardukar05> if its a inter venous needle sometimes they need to use butterfly needles
[2023-01-06 04:15:45] <%brittis_n3xus> in the end it worked out, you hired them for a reason

It is quite astonishing to see a female here in the Madlad Official discord. I am quite popular here in this server, so if you require any guidance, please, throw me a mention.
