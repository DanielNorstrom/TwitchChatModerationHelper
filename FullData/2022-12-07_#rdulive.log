[2022-12-07 18:04:44] <%+Gripeaway> @RduLIVE Do you have a decklist code?
[2022-12-07 18:04:45] <@%R2DU> @Gripeaway "Code this, code that" Does it ever stop? When will this stuff stop being HILARIOUS to people? I mean seriously is there no originality left on this world? Are we all just monkey see monkey do? I don't know about you guys but I'm sick of every time I look up a game, or a forum post, anything really I have to scroll past like 50 of these.

[2022-12-07 18:06:57] <@%R2DU> @demonslayer8665 Adge Rdu plays ads in between games so no one misses out on action. You can get rid of ads by subbing to the channel Kapp Thank you for understanding HUGGERS Adge
[2022-12-07 18:07:29] <angelasgg> Finally, RDU playing a mode he is good at LUL

[2022-12-07 18:08:55] <demonslayer8665> i dont really like th enew unlock system for warzone 2 for 1 gun you gotta unlock 2 others and to unlock them you gotta unlock more weapons and for thsoe you need to unlock more
[2022-12-07 18:09:00] <@%R2DU> yE Remember folks, use your Twitch Prime sub on your favorite Romanian Hearthstone streamer! PepegaCredit
[2022-12-07 18:09:16] <@%Yobimapi> Now that Rdu is playing constructed, where are all the "I dusted all my old card to craft this deck. How do I win with it?" jokes
[2022-12-07 18:09:21] <Cyberbeni> It's a 3 green requirement card, has to be good
[2022-12-07 18:09:26] <+Cornysan> Nah its actually fun :D

[2022-12-07 18:10:34] <demonslayer8665> frost death knight is so annoyingly spammy

[2022-12-07 18:10:47] <bogdan1499> @Weirdgus got it, thx
[2022-12-07 18:10:58] <demonslayer8665> they would keep freezing my hero so lifesteal did jack

[2022-12-07 18:13:03] <%klarkadam> so weird that the animation only shows the destroyed card from the deck so you have to check history @RduLIVE

[2022-12-07 18:14:45] <@%+Weirdgus> @RduLIVE I think people say DK is not strong enough
