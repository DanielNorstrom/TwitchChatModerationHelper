[2022-12-25 07:23:52] <%GoRibGo> I'm very glad my family is divided by wealth levels so I never see any of them except my parents and brother cause the rest are too rich for us lol
[2022-12-25 07:23:59] <+fingerrrrrr> was the med pack in the snow not usefull ?

[2022-12-25 07:24:21] <%$Zanoxis> my family is the type that I'm the only person to move more than 2 hours away.
[2022-12-25 07:24:37] <Koroberry> wanting to is the reason

[2022-12-25 07:37:22] <tmanner> looks like minecraft though wich is a little bit of a downer
[2022-12-25 07:37:23] <%EpicPumaNess> damn, nearly 20 days
[2022-12-25 07:37:29] <%nazzurro> that's a good stretch

[2022-12-25 07:40:07] <$Unweaver> YEP
[2022-12-25 07:40:14] <ShowtimeTylers> thats a compliment in itself
[2022-12-25 07:40:21] <goforbroke7> what was the bad part?
[2022-12-25 07:40:22] <$unknownohyeah> subnautica is a 10/10 for me
[2022-12-25 07:40:25] <ShowtimeTylers> there are certainly bad parts of it tho its not perfect
[2022-12-25 07:40:26] <+justfaytal> What was the bad part of it?
[2022-12-25 07:40:30] <%GoRibGo> what about that ice one?
[2022-12-25 07:40:47] <ShowtimeTylers> so, its all too linear and tedious
[2022-12-25 07:40:49] <ShowtimeTylers> I get it
[2022-12-25 07:41:01] <ShowtimeTylers> I love the game but I do understand that
[2022-12-25 07:41:33] <ShowtimeTylers> even with the finished rocket ship part, it was a weak ending
[2022-12-25 07:41:44] VIEWERS: 288
[2022-12-25 07:41:53] <goforbroke7> lolol, ya fair enough, i never actually completed the game myself, my save got destroyed and i never wanted to start over
[2022-12-25 07:42:01] <weaverbird_> the first couple hours are impeccable... then the game keeps going
[2022-12-25 07:42:25] <$unknownohyeah> developed the game like what? making you go deeper and deeper?
[2022-12-25 07:42:27] <ShowtimeTylers> I smoked a lot of weed when I played through that so that helped with the tedious aimless searching for minerals
[2022-12-25 07:42:29] <ShowtimeTylers> LUL
[2022-12-25 07:42:29] <%GoRibGo> I'm too afraid of underwater stuff to give it a go
[2022-12-25 07:42:34] <$unknownohyeah> i mean it's to item and crafting gate progress
[2022-12-25 07:42:34] <+Doustypants> @unknownohyeah same. 10/10 game for me. The original with the huge sub you could actually build on. I loved that. Subnautica 2 was bleh
[2022-12-25 07:42:53] <+LKK254> did you play the second subnautica? I dont know too much about it
[2022-12-25 07:43:20] <$unknownohyeah> dont play it lol
[2022-12-25 07:43:20] <ShowtimeTylers> never thought about it like that
[2022-12-25 07:43:27] <$unknownohyeah> it's significantly worse than the first
[2022-12-25 07:43:27] <ShowtimeTylers> 2nd one sucked so badly
[2022-12-25 07:43:44] VIEWERS: 288
[2022-12-25 07:43:45] <%nazzurro> awoo
[2022-12-25 07:44:07] <%GoRibGo> was the 2nd one finished? I just remember it being in ea forever
[2022-12-25 07:44:10] <+Doustypants> the second one didn't have the huge sub which was one of the best pats
[2022-12-25 07:44:17] <mystseer> @nazzurro rooNya /
[2022-12-25 07:44:17] <+Doustypants> having a mobile base was awesome
[2022-12-25 07:44:40] <+WolfManZach> I haven't finished the second one but I liked it. Zones are much more vibrant, and less of the game feels like you need a vehicle to explore.
[2022-12-25 07:44:46] <ShowtimeTylers> at least you were able to enjoy the first couple hours, still one of the best sections in a game ever I replayed that part like 10x
[2022-12-25 07:44:51] <ShowtimeTylers> I only ever actually beat it once
[2022-12-25 07:44:54] <$unknownohyeah> making the seatruck significantly slower the longer it gets was the worst design decision they could have made
[2022-12-25 07:45:01] <$unknownohyeah> totally ruins it
[2022-12-25 07:45:08] <weaverbird_> @doustypants which is kind of funny, because that's right when I think the first game stops being fun around that point of getting the sub

[2022-12-25 08:31:53] <ShowtimeTylers> @nilockin Twitch be twitchin again per usual
[2022-12-25 08:32:13] <$unknownohyeah> sometimes twitch is an ass and they purposefully lock people who use adblock to 360p
[2022-12-25 08:32:20] <$unknownohyeah> turn it off and you can see 1080p again
[2022-12-25 08:32:43] <CallMeHanna_> Ita true though
[2022-12-25 08:32:45] <%GoRibGo> I have adblock and am at 1080
[2022-12-25 08:32:46] <$unknownohyeah> it's not, the guy who does the anti adblock for twitch is a real prick
[2022-12-25 08:32:53] <%GoRibGo> it also just doesnt work for twitch for me
[2022-12-25 08:33:00] <$unknownohyeah> seen it myself lol
[2022-12-25 08:33:31] <%Spurpshub> the anti adblock that works flips to a 360 feed to achieve the adblock during ads. there's one option that stays on the 360.
[2022-12-25 08:33:32] <%nazzurro> to annoy people just enough to sub
[2022-12-25 08:33:33] <%+pargrok> twitch ads are server side so adblock does nothing
[2022-12-25 08:33:38] <%$CFischer> Every time I get ads I switch channels

[2022-12-25 08:34:10] <%+pargrok> if annoyed by ads and can't sub to everyone get twitch turbo
[2022-12-25 08:34:18] <%nazzurro> they force it on you
[2022-12-25 08:34:19] <%+pargrok> its 8.99 ad free
[2022-12-25 08:34:23] <%Spurpshub> for as long as turbo lasts
[2022-12-25 08:34:37] <%Spurpshub> if enough people notice turbo it will go
[2022-12-25 08:34:40] <CallMeHanna_> Reasonable
[2022-12-25 08:34:42] <$kollosae> I only ever get banner ads here
[2022-12-25 08:34:51] <%OPBlake> @pargrok Until they remove Twitch Turbo, or the ads atleast
[2022-12-25 08:34:56] <%poopbeast> if i get prerolled ads when im checking out someone's stream for the first time i immediately change streams lol
[2022-12-25 08:35:04] <ShowtimeTylers> you have a daughter to feed its perfectly fine
[2022-12-25 08:35:07] <%nazzurro> Hey you're all good to me, a good dad and you like the outdoors, so good to take care of that
[2022-12-25 08:35:08] <Celaphon> Yeah I dont seem to get video ads here which is weird
[2022-12-25 08:35:17] <EnigmaticRepose> My only issue with banner ads is always a sudden jumpscare of mostly pure white when most games aren't pure white
[2022-12-25 08:35:28] <%GoRibGo> I don't mind ads anyway unless its like over 5 in a row
[2022-12-25 08:35:28] <Liamclan> I dont mind the banner ads on my phone but they break the resolution and then I have to relaunch the stream
[2022-12-25 08:35:28] <%styyygian> yeah banners are much less obtrusive
[2022-12-25 08:35:31] <%Spurpshub> if streamer takes pis break to roll ads nobody nobody misses out
[2022-12-25 08:35:33] <$kollosae> I love the banner ads get to keep watching and don't miss out on any fun story time
[2022-12-25 08:35:41] <%+pargrok> @OPBlake well twitch turbo is profitable atm so use it and think about future when future comes
[2022-12-25 08:35:43] <SimonSez> I gave up on the whole chasing for the working adblocker of the week. Now I just VPN through a country that does not have ads

[2022-12-25 08:36:03] <+NickyBleezy> casting to a chromecast for some reason just stops ads

[2022-12-25 08:36:08] <+TheMM42> Wtf! Ads on a Hammer stream! Sits silently waiting for them to end while not caring.
[2022-12-25 08:36:13] <%nazzurro> that sounds impossible
[2022-12-25 08:36:23] <Celaphon> You could have a timer on screen and just have twitch chat remind you
[2022-12-25 08:36:35] <%GoRibGo> I always get french ads cause canada although I can't speak french lol
[2022-12-25 08:36:44] <ShowtimeTylers> lol
[2022-12-25 08:37:24] <Celaphon> A different streamer I watch does it and it seems fine
[2022-12-25 08:37:25] <%$DuranDuranDuran> If it really bothers you you can get turbo, or a vpn if you don't want to reward twitch for being bad.
[2022-12-25 08:37:38] <Xzombeastiex> Man who cares we get plenty of free content watching some adds is nothing
[2022-12-25 08:37:39] <%+pargrok> twitch turbo also gives more money to streamer if you are in channel and un subbed then a normal viewer
[2022-12-25 08:37:45] <Xzombeastiex> But that’s just me

[2022-12-25 08:38:12] <%+pargrok> its not 2.50 but its more then nothing if you need to choose between a sub and a turbo
[2022-12-25 08:38:32] <%OPBlake> @pargrok Give me 1 free sub to a streamer and I'd do Turbo
[2022-12-25 08:38:33] <%+nilockin> Even as someone who hates ads, the ads were fine. Ads might be a roadblock for gaining new viewers but us regulars don't mind.

[2022-12-25 08:38:45] <CommunismForDummies> ads while watching vods are the worst but other than that it's not bad
[2022-12-25 08:38:50] <%OPBlake> Why not try it for a few days, see if it does change it, if it does, you can always stop

[2022-12-25 08:38:56] <%Lakart> Yeah nah fuck the ads, I've been paying for this sub since subs meant no ads.
[2022-12-25 08:38:57] <%EpicPumaNess> I don't mind ads, but it seems like everytime I get them its like 5 2 minute ads
[2022-12-25 08:39:03] <Liamclan> I still love ready player one for their comment on adds and how businesses try to use them
[2022-12-25 08:39:19] <%+pargrok> @OPBlake they give you a million free ad free channels just no emotes or sub only chat

[2022-12-25 08:39:52] <Xzombeastiex> Your add breaks are nothing compared to some other people. Your vods hardly ever give me adds to
[2022-12-25 08:39:57] <+neonzerozeta> A streamer I used to follow would put 8 ads every 20 min lol
[2022-12-25 08:40:03] <%+doomtrout> Yea, you got a kid to think about. Not even a question
[2022-12-25 08:40:07] <$Trilex> did your mortgage go up too?
[2022-12-25 08:40:12] <%OPBlake> @pargrok The few streams I actively watch Im subbed to, I have like 3 I watch im not subbed and they dont run long ads anyway lol
[2022-12-25 08:40:30] <%EpicPumaNess> this is currently the only stream I'm regularly tuning into atm

[2022-12-25 08:41:57] <%$mord_> people don't seem to mind those at much since they don't completely block the stream
