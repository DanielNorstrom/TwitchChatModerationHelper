[2022-12-11 03:52:15] <%+Manicteddie> wait what
[2022-12-11 03:52:16] <+Wolf9k2> the way natural world gen works when defeating the wall of flesh for the first time is it spawns hallow and corruption in a v shape towards the bottom of the map and it's a wide v so that's why there's so much hallow in hell
[2022-12-11 03:52:20] <%BaosilisK> Chatting

[2022-12-11 04:31:14] <%+Manicteddie> you need to make a platform where you can shoot from the top not where it can reach it but where it cant despawn
[2022-12-11 04:31:53] <%+Manicteddie> plus gunners need to start using explosive rounds
[2022-12-11 04:32:14] <%+Manicteddie> you need to be able to see itlike the worms body still and it will not despawn

[2022-12-11 08:06:26] <raynn_n> whut the heck
[2022-12-11 08:06:29] <powerpuncher24> should make the whip
[2022-12-11 08:06:36] <Encryptoh> do this aleks
[2022-12-11 08:06:50] <powerpuncher24> yes
[2022-12-11 08:06:54] <%Tiberous> yes
[2022-12-11 08:06:55] <powerpuncher24> its good
[2022-12-11 08:06:55] <DemonicFaith> yes
[2022-12-11 08:06:56] <rayymmond> No
[2022-12-11 08:06:58] <DemonicFaith> they're amazing
[2022-12-11 08:06:59] <+berserker_thor> make an optic staff
[2022-12-11 08:07:01] <+corneliuscummins> harp is really good against destroyer since it does tons of pierce damage
[2022-12-11 08:07:05] <rayymmond> Bats are better
[2022-12-11 08:07:08] <ImKrezai> the sanguine staff is probably better
[2022-12-11 08:07:10] <+berserker_thor> it doubles your minion county
[2022-12-11 08:07:16] <+MrAstor> i like the bats better imo
[2022-12-11 08:07:26] <drukkz> sanguine staff is 100% better, sanguine staff will carry you through most of hardmode
[2022-12-11 08:07:26] <rayymmond> The sanguine staff is more consister
[2022-12-11 08:07:27] <doscomputer> hallowed armor would be bigger than big
[2022-12-11 08:07:37] <rayymmond> Just make durendal
[2022-12-11 08:07:37] <kingdomiessking> pentawPumping
[2022-12-11 08:07:43] <+berserker_thor> Sanguine is more consistent, but Optic does slightly more damage
[2022-12-11 08:07:56] <ThanDone> regular HUHH
[2022-12-11 08:07:59] <Encryptoh> information SeemsGood
[2022-12-11 08:07:59] <Dialapis> hallowed armor is the first real hardmode set, it basically gives a free hit every 20-30 secs
[2022-12-11 08:08:18] <rayymmond> Optic staff isn’t worth it sanguine is more consistent
[2022-12-11 08:09:02] <rayymmond> Make the new whip
[2022-12-11 08:09:05] <ImKrezai> the chest arnor has a lot more defense
[2022-12-11 08:09:17] <powerpuncher24> id make the whip pretty sure its better
[2022-12-11 08:09:26] <DemonicFaith> hallowed bars
[2022-12-11 08:09:26] <rayymmond> Hallowed bars

[2022-12-11 08:09:53] <rayymmond> It doesn’t look like a whip
[2022-12-11 08:10:00] <honeycuck> hallowed armor has defense distributed weirdly on helms because it is the difference between classes
[2022-12-11 08:10:34] <Encryptoh> tru
[2022-12-11 08:10:47] <+corneliuscummins> Hallowed gives a free dodge
[2022-12-11 08:10:48] <powerpuncher24> if you re roll it id imagin the twins are better

[2022-12-11 08:32:32] <%MrNive> Terraria has a misleading exterior
[2022-12-11 08:32:40] <+corneliuscummins> Only thing lacking is LORE
[2022-12-11 08:32:42] <%MrNive> Easy to dismiss
[2022-12-11 08:32:43] <%Nuggo_> I gotta try Terraria again at some point, but need friends to play it with
[2022-12-11 08:32:46] <%+xH2Ohh> it's looked fun watching yall play it
[2022-12-11 08:32:51] <%BananaBoat> it's definitely more complex than Minecraft. MC has it's nostalgia though
[2022-12-11 08:32:59] <%sharkumon> herobrine doo
[2022-12-11 08:33:00] <%sharkumon> dood

[2022-12-11 08:33:08] <%BananaBoat> yeah, it's fun to watch your group play.
[2022-12-11 08:33:11] <@%ken_mayor> NODDERS
[2022-12-11 08:33:13] <DemonicFaith> I remember when terraria came out a lot of people were shitting on it for being a MC copy
[2022-12-11 08:33:20] <mm_orios> "2d minecraft" is the biggest lie terraria is so much more than that
[2022-12-11 08:33:20] <appofs> For me the amount of depth intimidates me from opening the game
[2022-12-11 08:33:26] <%julliethecutie> I do like watching you guys vibe and discover new shit
[2022-12-11 08:33:49] <rayymmond> You need a specific bait or rod to fish in lava
[2022-12-11 08:33:53] <drukkz> you need special bait to fish in lava
[2022-12-11 08:33:58] <%cyberchig> Lava bait

[2022-12-11 08:34:23] <%Nuggo_> looks like Terraria has more rpg elements than Minecraft
[2022-12-11 08:34:27] <rayymmond> You can catch and use

[2022-12-11 09:08:42] <%+Manicteddie> @aleks the adds will spawn off the worm and you can see them come off the worms so more adds you kill less you deal with
[2022-12-11 09:08:51] <%+killerav_> no it stays that big the whole time until the health bar is drained just some segments stop shooting
[2022-12-11 09:09:09] <+Jar7> Definitely not doing enough damage

[2022-12-11 09:11:02] <paperplanerr1> the nimbus rod is a solid weapon, forgot how I killed this dude
[2022-12-11 09:11:17] <+corneliuscummins> They could make solid platform and adds can’t cross no?
[2022-12-11 09:11:29] <%+Manicteddie> @paperplanerr1 on master mode or classic
[2022-12-11 09:11:32] <ImKrezai> the cool whip would probably be better because of the snowflake going through all the segments

But on top of it all, he was the son of the famed YouTuber, the CEO of Cow Chop International itself, Sir Aleks Marchant. A lot of expectation had been set on this boy's shoulders from a young age, and it was finally time for him to prove himself. The teacher filtered through the list of names, until it was time to hear the young heir's voice. "Dennis Paghetti?"
