[2022-12-28 07:22:20] <%talrielz> i havent watched u in a bit cuz ive been busy, how have u felt about their adjustments basically making all the classes they boosted the same with 70% offering rates? i appreciate they did a lot to attempt to balance but it just shows how hopeless these types of old set new set rotations are to me when thats the only option for viability
[2022-12-28 07:22:23] <!%bert3326> ok yeah, it's like that
[2022-12-28 07:22:33] <!%+KBB24_Mamba_Forever> @Tazny not all HS cards are wow characters... some of them are HS exclusive Kappa
[2022-12-28 07:22:43] <!%bert3326> those are some of the ugliest items in WoW (his outfit) and are often used as a transmog

[2022-12-28 07:23:27] <@%Tazny> @KBB24_Mamba_Forever I cant tell if you're serious because of the Kappa emote but that wouldnt surprise me, which ones are HS exclusive if any?
[2022-12-28 07:23:31] <%talrielz> but yeah it doesnt really feel like arena when every draft is more or less the same
[2022-12-28 07:23:58] <!%bert3326> some of the cards that are exclusive have since been added to WoW but for instance the book of mercenaries characters are HS exclusive @Tazny

[2022-12-28 07:39:05] <%gchlmp> maybe in draft, youcould right click a card to add it to a 10 slot sideboard. At 25 cards+10 sideboard, you can pick 5 of those 10 to actually put in your deck.  To get cards into arena that need synergy/fit a niche archetype.

[2022-12-28 07:51:55] <%talrielz> triple single is more viable now cuz it guarantees more class cards

[2022-12-28 08:51:19] <%talrielz> its funny because there is bad play and there are plays that look bad but are actually advanced plays that give you an out to win the game rather than just lose slower. ive had people shit talk me for doing a line of play that was objectively correct but cuz they were so bad they couldnt see it

[2022-12-28 12:32:12] <@%Tazny> Yeah your moustache looks nice I mean
[2022-12-28 12:32:44] <@%Tazny> @DFOJoe I'd just be jammin'
[2022-12-28 12:32:51] <%ArmsOfMichelleObama> How tf do you get 2 astalors and I still have yet to get one Sadge
[2022-12-28 12:33:00] <+ikenpaiii> deck looks pretty average to me beside astalor and the parrot combo
[2022-12-28 12:33:38] <GayEagleDima> the 4 drop is magical though
[2022-12-28 12:33:58] <@%Tazny> If you're gonna play Australian songs though I would request Powderfinger :)

[2022-12-28 12:34:11] <!%+rudhan26> you have a non playable 11 mana combo tho
[2022-12-28 12:34:32] <DFOJoe> I've never heard of Powderfinger PepoG
[2022-12-28 12:34:39] <%DeathVortexOne> weren't Silverchair from australia too @Tazny
[2022-12-28 12:34:48] <%DeathVortexOne> one of my fav bands from old days LUL
[2022-12-28 12:34:48] <DFOJoe> time to educate myself I guess LUL
[2022-12-28 12:35:07] <@%Tazny> "These Days" such a classic Pog
[2022-12-28 12:35:11] <!%+rudhan26> 10 mana shaman spell into bloodlust KEKW
[2022-12-28 12:35:13] <%+iesco7> for greedy u probably lost xD
[2022-12-28 12:35:15] <%ArmsOfMichelleObama> From De Other Side into Bloodlust I think they mean
[2022-12-28 12:35:16] <DFOJoe> Yeah I'm only familiar with the sex move variation
[2022-12-28 12:35:23] <DFOJoe> But I figured Tazny wasn't talking about that one
[2022-12-28 12:35:33] <@%Tazny> This one isnt too bad either
[2022-12-28 12:35:42] <@%Tazny> catJAM

[2022-12-28 12:36:15] <@%Tazny> This is a good one too, thanks for playing it :)
[2022-12-28 12:36:25] <GayEagleDima> why is he trading
[2022-12-28 12:36:34] <%DeathVortexOne> oh yeah Silverchair was an australian rock band
[2022-12-28 12:36:43] <%DeathVortexOne> google tells me LUL
[2022-12-28 12:37:15] <+bluberion> Do we know which one will duplicate or is it random ?
[2022-12-28 12:37:15] <@%Tazny> Yeah Silverchair's "Tomorrow" is great
[2022-12-28 12:37:31] <%DeathVortexOne> yeah they have some really nice bangers
[2022-12-28 12:37:37] <%medricx> Might be time to ban Malignant from arena
[2022-12-28 12:37:46] <DFOJoe> Honestly, this is as good or better than any of the 90s rock I crave from time to time cyberk52Thumbsup @Tazny good stuff
[2022-12-28 12:38:06] <@%Tazny> @DFOJoe They have some great albums I would recommend :)
[2022-12-28 12:38:08] VIEWERS: 747
[2022-12-28 12:38:33] <+boltthrower> Can you make malignant fair but still strong? Make it a 2/3? Make it cost 1 more mana?
[2022-12-28 12:38:51] <+neuroghast_> the last game was a loss?
[2022-12-28 12:38:58] <%DeathVortexOne> best is to remove horror altogether i think
[2022-12-28 12:39:16] <%medricx> They won‚Äôt have two versions for arena and standard. It‚Äôs already underpowered in standard.
[2022-12-28 12:39:22] <%DeathVortexOne> makes it a bit fair
[2022-12-28 12:39:29] <GayEagleDima> played sunwell, magic 4, 2 astalors but dead
[2022-12-28 12:39:38] <%DeathVortexOne> @medricx true
[2022-12-28 12:39:39] <%medricx> That‚Äôs why a ban is the solution
[2022-12-28 12:39:57] <Sarkasth> change the stats and make it take 1dmg at the end of turn Kappa

[2022-12-28 12:40:52] <%medricx> I think it would still suck in standard if it cost 0 corpses. It‚Äôs so slow. You would just die to an agro Druid.
[2022-12-28 12:41:24] <kybearbear> that's a large fallen cleric

[2022-12-28 12:45:54] <kybearbear> why disenchant now and not wait until refund?
[2022-12-28 12:45:54] <kthyress> why not disenchant all the non-golden cards if you're only playing arena?
[2022-12-28 12:45:58] <+ikenpaiii> battlemaster or fireball?
