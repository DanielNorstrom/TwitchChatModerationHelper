[2022-12-23 18:21:22] <%Lars_Chan> Maybe use the ash of war "repeating thrust" on your rapier since it hits multible times and each hit inflicts status. So parry --> repeating thrust --> repeat 2-3 times --> rot + poison. Idk if that works but I think that it should.

[2022-12-23 18:48:51] <%AsherCanid> No scrot
[2022-12-23 18:48:57] <%Baryon23> you would need 10 consecutive hits to rot him. with the parries, he's almost certainly not getting buildup at all
[2022-12-23 18:49:05] <@%+Lakerr_> just parry him to death KEKW
[2022-12-23 18:49:06] <crookie2cookie> I think the problem is that the build up goes down by the time you parry him again
[2022-12-23 18:49:14] <%$LeeJamz> You could rot breath this guy pretty easy with first one gone
[2022-12-23 18:49:25] <%thefifthmatt> is this misericorde now?
[2022-12-23 18:49:26] <%Dooglie> sadgekick1 I updated my chat so it prefers emotes before names, so no more accidental sadgekick1 Sadge

[2022-12-23 18:49:37] <%AsherCanid> Yeah, breath might work if you can get distance
[2022-12-23 18:49:37] <MarshallRTEast> If you would've used misericorde from start he would be dead by now LUL

[2022-12-23 18:50:02] <%+encode1g> @dinossindgeil What if you throw a rot pot after parry
[2022-12-23 18:50:05] <%Baryon23> this guy has an AI trick where you hit his shield and strafe around because he does the same attack when you hit the shield
[2022-12-23 18:50:08] <%$LeeJamz> @hemiak fair
[2022-12-23 18:50:16] <%+LeonWithABeard> Can you try rot breath after parrying him instead of visceral stabbing?
[2022-12-23 18:50:21] <%+sadgekick1> @Dooglie  NOOOO it was funny though
[2022-12-23 18:50:31] <%Dooglie> 8-9 parries to go
[2022-12-23 18:50:32] <@%voax> just parry him to death
[2022-12-23 18:50:32] <%Dooglie> I estimate
[2022-12-23 18:50:36] <!%TurtleArmyJess> @LeonWithABeard the breath isn't fast enough for that
[2022-12-23 18:50:44] <%amadeus25> you got this
