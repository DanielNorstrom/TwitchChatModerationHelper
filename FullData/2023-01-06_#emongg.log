[2023-01-06 00:09:04] <+TwoPointInfinity> are you under contract to stay on twitch? Twitch has been becoming less and less user friendly in my opinion. Would you ever re-stream to youtube or switch anything like that? Is where you stream ever been considered?

[2023-01-06 00:21:17] <%KevinKalani> @GrumpyJackalope I think the things I noticed the most with lower ranked tanks, is standing out in the open and not having a safe route to get back into cover. Corners are very important

[2023-01-06 00:24:06] <Travasicus> They should have a section in game to show important overwatch tweets

[2023-01-06 00:24:26] <cantfindgeorge> Twitter =/= patch notes or dev updates
[2023-01-06 00:24:26] <@%^StreamElements> TwoPointInfinity, Emongg's ult is on numpad4 because he plays with arrow keys. He does not play left handed. The reason the other abilities say E and Shift is because they are double bound.
[2023-01-06 00:24:27] <YuiStrawberry> patch notes used to be on the main menu
[2023-01-06 00:24:28] <Absnerdity> BattleNet launcher has all kinds of room for new absK
[2023-01-06 00:24:32] <cantfindgeorge> This should be a blue text not twitter
[2023-01-06 00:24:32] <allenboyhs> @Emongg but they need space for shop and battle pass and stuff

[2023-01-06 00:38:11] <+TwoPointInfinity> for each target hit with axe is 2 less seconds of cooldown. 4 people hit would allow you to DOUBLE AXE
[2023-01-06 00:38:13] <nemebliss> most disappointing thing about the patch is that there are still no Hog nerfs

[2023-01-06 00:42:01] <Mulletmasterflxx> so in total it still does 95 damage
[2023-01-06 00:42:02] <%Nennai> @ChronoAura yes, you can drat at the checkpoints in push, the point on hybrid, and much more rarely, certain doors/checkpoints on the payload portion of hybrid, and payload as a whole

[2023-01-06 00:42:13] <1stplays> they need to give her more options to multi-target bleed and a buff to her damage

[2023-01-06 00:58:35] <bl1tz_w1ng3r_alt_acc> I AM SPEECHLESS BY YOUR PERFORMANCE
[2023-01-06 00:58:45] <xxplicitt> I don’t see why you’d pick JQ over other tanks still
[2023-01-06 00:58:51] <hisham2001> Why do most ow streamers have squeaky voices?
[2023-01-06 00:58:51] <+dctrmyst> will you be able to get the mythic junkerqueen skin after the battle pass is over

[2023-01-06 00:59:06] <tyrant_003> @skunk41 not really just a bit better
[2023-01-06 00:59:08] <+myrtl_o7> i wish the knife throw was reduced by one second more
[2023-01-06 00:59:10] <+brigadier11> better offensively or defensively?
[2023-01-06 00:59:12] <xGooodluck> she’s so fun to play and she definitely deserved this buff.
[2023-01-06 00:59:12] <$kimkristian> can u explain whatthey did toqueen?
[2023-01-06 00:59:13] <+myrtl_o7> its the fun part of her
[2023-01-06 00:59:16] <cyablu> @hisham2001 what’s wrong with squeaky voices? Why do you even care
[2023-01-06 00:59:21] <TheCoolHand> Good enough to be in the meta?
[2023-01-06 00:59:25] <%Oneminuterice> does anyone else think its crazy that its probably easier to get golden guns now than it is skins?
[2023-01-06 00:59:25] <neighborhoodspiderman21> I saw her!
[2023-01-06 00:59:27] <Skunk41> thx for answers guys
[2023-01-06 00:59:30] <+VentusWK> @Oneminuterice Maybe depends on the hero? I'm not sure how well hog combo works against 250 hp targets.
[2023-01-06 00:59:35] <Nexallus> @tharvgm they haven’t
[2023-01-06 00:59:50] <Nexallus> @xxplicitt for the zeus skin of course Kappa
[2023-01-06 00:59:51] <tyrant_003> @oneminuterice well no shit golden weapons are free
[2023-01-06 00:59:57] <%Oneminuterice> @Oneminuterice he one taps reaper normally so should still be the same i think
[2023-01-06 00:59:59] <+brawnyuga> I like the idea flats had making the knife hitbox bigger

[2023-01-06 15:55:47] <CassiHikari> She is

[2023-01-06 15:57:39] <Assimilater> I think ram is the most underwhelming in this mode actually

[2023-01-06 15:57:50] <$talon824> I had one game that a Pharah won with 6 deaths. Second place was a Rein with 22 deaths

[2023-01-06 15:57:59] <Legenjerry> queen self heals more and axe has better cooldown
[2023-01-06 15:58:00] <%+tm_901> its EZ with the ult

[2023-01-06 16:11:06] <%RhettOfBodom> i like lucio in this mode but without his ult you are kinda weak

[2023-01-06 16:11:30] <%Pkkspiral> @Brettshackett Sojourn is the one for me. I do well on her, but when I consistently go against T500 and GM as a Gold/Plat it's hard to compete.

[2023-01-06 16:26:47] <saphirerider> The thing with orisa is, you ignore her, and go for her supports instead
[2023-01-06 16:26:53] <saphirerider> horse can't do much without the supports
[2023-01-06 16:26:54] <blue10q> is junkerqueen any good now?

[2023-01-06 16:27:04] <%$Brettshackett> Don’t get me wrong Road is very very strong but I just think ability wise and even ult, she is more useful than hog
[2023-01-06 16:27:08] <BigDanger31> Hi
[2023-01-06 16:27:26] <internet_crasher> whats the best dps now?
[2023-01-06 16:27:27] <$talon824> @barneym578 If someone dies with a bleed, you instantly get the remaining healing, 2s off Carnage cd for each person hit, landing a knife does less damage, but a stronger bleed
[2023-01-06 16:27:34] <ojarrett99> emongg why did you get two super good dps and both of mine had less than 4 kills - enemy horse last game

[2023-01-06 16:28:28] <+bittlegut> still not much tho
[2023-01-06 16:28:30] <+SynthhInHD> The healing is based on the remaining amount of bleed damage on the target, right?
[2023-01-06 16:28:33] <%simplystimpy> is that only for the throw?
[2023-01-06 16:28:51] <Kujibo> Is the object rampage bug fixed or is it still on?

[2023-01-06 16:29:10] <$talon824> @simplystimpy All bleeds. Ult, carnage, direct knife, melee, return knife
[2023-01-06 16:29:16] <%$janonymous> Is it a burst heal or an instant heal emongg

[2023-01-06 16:32:26] <$talon824> @synthhinhd So melee does 30 damage, and with Junker queen, it does an extra 5 dps for 3s.
[2023-01-06 16:32:36] <%subseiko> What is the worst tank for queen to play into?
[2023-01-06 16:32:43] <saphirerider> probably hog

[2023-01-06 16:33:04] <+SynthhInHD> @talon824 damage and dps are different, so what is the difference here? 30 damage immediately and 5 additional damage over time? Or a 5 damage bleed?

[2023-01-06 16:33:53] <%$Brettshackett> So if you get elims w your abilities, it heals you?
[2023-01-06 16:34:00] <%RhettOfBodom> @The_Silent_Sasha people dont like his gigantic high damage explosives lol
[2023-01-06 16:34:00] <%+Ob1WanKenoli> junk and hog are chaotic neutral
[2023-01-06 16:34:13] <$talon824> @synthhinhd So you do the melee and it does 30 instant, and applies a bleed effect that does 15 damage over 3s, or 5dps
[2023-01-06 16:34:22] <mrwang30> play on controller
[2023-01-06 16:34:33] <%KevinKalani> @Brettshackett Abilities always healed you a little, it's just that the elims now give you the instant burst of healing instead of over time
[2023-01-06 16:34:33] <%YungGuapa> I hate pushing this corner

[2023-01-06 16:34:46] <+SynthhInHD> @talon824 I see, so 45 damage total. Is it better than just shooting?
[2023-01-06 16:34:51] <The_Silent_Sasha> Yis I meant lore wise, sorry my bad
[2023-01-06 16:35:03] <%+tm_901> it does 50 instant and 30 bleed i think

[2023-01-06 16:36:03] <$talon824> @synthhinhd Shooting is definitely better, but what you’ll often see is someone shoot, then melee, to add both damage together and get the little bit of bleed healing
[2023-01-06 16:36:05] <+ZeoBishop> @stinkysaint i want to say no i think you have to do it in the game mode
[2023-01-06 16:36:18] <%KevinKalani> @Brettshackett Hitting knife throws, or even having the knife call back to her procs the "bleed", carnage axe, melee, and ult...all cause bleed

[2023-01-06 16:38:31] <$talon824> @brettshackett Basically yeah, each of Junker Queen’s damage over time effects cause “wounds” or “bleeds” that trigger her passive to self heal

[2023-01-06 16:39:24] <%KevinKalani> @Brettshackett Correct. You will start the healing immediately after hitting the ability, but if you finish the kill before the DOT healing finishes, you get the rest of it instantly. So for example. using your abilities to finish a kill is probably the best way to get the heals, though you don't want to hold it just for those moments because you're losing out on damage
[2023-01-06 16:39:25] <%+rhundley> Ball is also great fun

[2023-01-06 16:39:52] <soord_n_boord> @synthhinhd her melee attack does 10 more damage, and applies the bleed effect that also heals her. Constantly using the blade will increase your survivability a little bit.

[2023-01-06 17:00:18] <middleearth915> I'm not sure how it translates in higher ranks but the moira buff feels nice in low ranks. Everyone just lets the orb hit them so you can basically always have your heals up.
[2023-01-06 17:00:29] <alliancecntrl> @Frankenfunk sugar cookies in tea does sound gross

[2023-01-06 17:01:45] <%+Ob1WanKenoli> Moira does well in mid ranks because she lets you get away with bad positioning and people in general struggle to aim

[2023-01-06 17:02:04] <$talon824> @zachscoots69420 The answer to your question is clearly “ferrets in vests” before knowing the question
[2023-01-06 17:02:05] <soord_n_boord> @ob1wankenoli she also doesn't require as much aiming
[2023-01-06 17:02:06] <ChronoAura> It feels like your Hanzo is missing every shot, because of the enemy speed boost.
[2023-01-06 17:02:09] <%+Ob1WanKenoli> Plus lots of healing is king in low ranks
[2023-01-06 17:02:12] <%+Turtalis> 300 kills is way too much imo when if you win you only end up with 20 per game
[2023-01-06 17:02:18] <%+Frankenfunk> It was just a weird taste, it shouldn't be a thing

[2023-01-06 17:03:51] <%KevinKalani> I mean OW2 is much more like Team Death Match than Overwatch 1 was. Meta right now until Hog and Sojourn is nerfed, the meta is playing for picks...so it's actually not much different than CoD. It's this meta that makes it that way, and that's why people hate this meta @zachscoots69420

[2023-01-06 17:04:31] <%zachscoots69420> @kevinkalani I agree but it’s still solely a team based game
[2023-01-06 17:04:57] <%zachscoots69420> You can’t just push into 5 heads solo and expect to kill everyone without some type of help
[2023-01-06 17:05:12] <%+tm_901> team based game decided by tank or sojourn diff

[2023-01-06 17:06:25] <$talon824> @ph0b0s Widow can oneshot her, but she’s also largely immobile, making it easier for sojourn, whose AD strafe is really hard to hit, to duel effectively

[2023-01-06 17:10:37] <%KevinKalani> @soord_n_boord that's not the point I'm making. the point I'm making is CoD isn't a game where you solo either...you have to rely on your teammates to kinda contribute. If the enemy team is 5 people just fragging and you're the only one fragging, you still lose.

[2023-01-06 17:12:40] <%+ZerekMasters> Does it clear pulse bomb?
[2023-01-06 17:12:41] <%zachscoots69420> @kevinkalani I agree on that. But she be sucking my orb up with her cheerleader spin
[2023-01-06 17:12:41] <%+GKLGAMING> swift step should not cleanse ever imo

[2023-01-06 17:12:43] <+AdranNailo> is swift step intentional nerf or bug?
[2023-01-06 17:12:44] <77MANDARiN> hello from ukraine
[2023-01-06 17:12:45] <%thats_so_rydon> so no invulnerability frames when TPing?
[2023-01-06 17:12:49] <rockycastro_> hello!
[2023-01-06 17:12:50] <Kaito_Cam> Having to get 300 final blows in a FFA match full of kill stealing is a nightmare
[2023-01-06 17:12:52] <$rashaadlmao> @b_roozi hell no
[2023-01-06 17:12:53] <TheCuddlySpartan> @ZerekMasters no, same with mag nade
[2023-01-06 17:12:56] <+MidKnightMayhem> The bug works on friendly mei ice walls too
[2023-01-06 17:12:58] <%+DylanInSpace> @thats_so_rydon correct
[2023-01-06 17:12:59] <+MidKnightMayhem> Also shields
[2023-01-06 17:13:00] <josephsiciliano2> played a ton of OW1, got to high master. is OW2 worth getting back into it?
[2023-01-06 17:13:06] <rorkxdlqnghkf> JK E skill cooldown decrease applies to the breakable objects 😂
[2023-01-06 17:13:10] <%zachscoots69420> But definitely easiest tank to get a head shot on in my opinion
[2023-01-06 17:13:12] <Hedennina> @Kaito_Cam It's honestly the worst
[2023-01-06 17:13:12] <%thats_so_rydon> Thanks @DylanInSpace !

[2023-01-06 17:13:13] <+MrSuperfreak> It's strange they keep introducing these things without saying anything
[2023-01-06 17:13:14] <%SonicBoom113> Should swift step cleanse the kiriko?
[2023-01-06 17:13:28] <+AdranNailo> massive hanzo buff
[2023-01-06 17:13:30] <%+tm_901> @josephsiciliano2 try it, if you have fun then its worth it
[2023-01-06 17:13:37] <DONGOROTH_> i bet hanzos arm was intentional but no one liked it so they just silently fixed it
[2023-01-06 17:13:45] <rockycastro_> what is hanzo's glitch?
[2023-01-06 17:13:48] <+MidKnightMayhem> Maybe it wasn't a bug? what if they just went back on the hanzo change
[2023-01-06 17:13:51] <$talon824> @thats_so_rydon The i-frames I think are still there,  just no cleanse
[2023-01-06 17:13:51] <%$Brettshackett> What’s the hanzo glitch?

[2023-01-06 17:14:07] <chaseman123> meanwhile tracer bug was in the patch
[2023-01-06 17:14:09] <KaynTSA> can one of the mods please explain to me where did I violet the rules and why I got timed out.. I'm new here
[2023-01-06 17:14:09] <+TrippingCat> so that animation was a bug?
[2023-01-06 17:14:09] <%oneir1c> what was the issue?
[2023-01-06 17:14:09] <wheresmycouch> @brettshackett his bow had insane recoil
[2023-01-06 17:14:13] <+MrSuperfreak> Yeah weird
[2023-01-06 17:14:13] <+Brewpub_> @Brettshackett he had a visual bug where his bow looked like it had massive recoil
[2023-01-06 17:14:13] <%KevinKalani> Looks a little sus...they should probably nerf Genji
[2023-01-06 17:14:13] <JustALilCub> they were probably too embarassed :)
[2023-01-06 17:14:18] <+TrippingCat> it looked so awkward
[2023-01-06 17:14:22] <%cozykiller_> Just got a 60 kill game 20,000 damage
[2023-01-06 17:14:22] <%+tm_901> theres a fov bug instead of recoil now apparently
[2023-01-06 17:14:24] <SouL128> the introduction of hansos bug wasn't  in the patch notes as well...
[2023-01-06 17:14:26] <+CrunchyCookie11> Didn’t they say they were changing hog in January??? Or am i taking crazy pills
[2023-01-06 17:14:28] <+bird9od> did they fix genji animation @Emongg
[2023-01-06 17:14:30] <$rashaadlmao> @kevinkalani hilarious!
[2023-01-06 17:14:31] <%thats_so_rydon> oh gotcha @talon824 !

[2023-01-06 17:14:43] <%RhettOfBodom> they said hanzo was able to see too much stuff in front of him
[2023-01-06 17:14:45] <DONGOROTH_> maybe to have your hand go near the crosshairs, they prolly thought it would make aiming more reliable
[2023-01-06 17:14:47] <elmoskiller> this game is early access so no worries everyone
[2023-01-06 17:14:57] <+CrunchyCookie11> Ahh I see
[2023-01-06 17:14:57] <Strattekun> They also forgot to mention that Kiriko no longer cleanses herself with swift step
[2023-01-06 17:15:00] <+MrSuperfreak> does magnetic grenade follow Kirko atm?
[2023-01-06 17:15:01] <%+Ob1WanKenoli> small indy developer guys chill
[2023-01-06 17:15:02] <ChronoAura> Hog is getting his own patch, since it's a small rework
[2023-01-06 17:15:06] <%Deno1100> i thought it didnt actually move your crosshair, was just a visual glitch
[2023-01-06 17:15:09] <%+GKLGAMING> "added recoil to hangout because hangout was overperforming in some skill tiers"
[2023-01-06 17:15:11] <+DrilldoBaggins2> i think just shorten his leash and he'll be ok

[2023-01-06 17:15:20] <%+GKLGAMING> *hanzo
[2023-01-06 17:15:22] <%KevinKalani> They actually nerfed Genji by fixing the bug, because now Hanzo's can actually aim at him when Genji dives them
[2023-01-06 17:15:27] <DONGOROTH_> no it doesnt move your crosshair, it just moved your hand to the crosshair
[2023-01-06 17:15:31] <usamin> i knew something felt weird about him
[2023-01-06 17:15:32] <%KevinKalani> Genji constantly catching L's
[2023-01-06 17:15:40] <KaynTSA> Hanzo ult is so weak now

[2023-01-06 17:16:17] <%zachscoots69420> What’s wrong with his animation?
[2023-01-06 17:16:18] <$talon824> @kayntsa It’s always been basically zoning outside of interactions with stuff like Grav
[2023-01-06 17:16:20] <+MidKnightMayhem> Thats how you know the arrows were hitting hard lmao

[2023-01-06 17:23:41] <%KevinKalani> @talon824 Going through walls is fine. It's the only way to get kills tbh. but it has its uses...like keeping people from going through chokes, or even last fights where the enemy needs to recontest, throw it at spawn.

[2023-01-06 18:00:56] <Amikuh> I wish she was a viable character
[2023-01-06 18:00:58] <overwatchmokey> Why did they wait to nerf hog?
[2023-01-06 18:01:02] <%SirTryhard7> Why does rammatra punch thru her shield
[2023-01-06 18:01:02] <%SwaggSwayhem> I’ve not seen a single brig in any games I’ve played at all since season 2 and I saw one yesterday so the buffs clearly OP YEP

[2023-01-06 18:01:45] <allenboyhs> imo they should give brig 300hp, 700 shield hp and perma armor from rally that'd be enough
[2023-01-06 18:01:46] <clever_corvid> Brig is my most player character, but I wouldn't want to see her buffed too much, or I would want them to be careful with it.  I don't want another "my support thinks they're a DPS" character
[2023-01-06 18:01:49] <AestheticVampire> moira feels the same imo

[2023-01-06 18:04:55] <%SirTryhard7> Brig needs a range beyond what she has man
[2023-01-06 18:05:03] <AestheticVampire> nerf his
[2023-01-06 18:05:07] <%+h1bears> I think they should give brig a supporting buff. Like she can do small heals attacking her own team. Or a small damage/speed boost to people around her
[2023-01-06 18:05:10] <%+Megatto> They should bring Brig's shield bash stun back

[2023-01-06 19:03:47] <GnxrlyPlays> @porkchoppd Super tough in support especially in lower ranks because your teammates don't always peel for you when needed.

[2023-01-06 19:06:58] <%+nothinggood27> @porkchoppd imo best way to get higher is learning what your team needs.. e.g. do you have to feed with your rein who charges in off cooldown to have a chance? or do you have to prioritize damage cause your team can't get kills? Or keep your heals focussed on one teammate who is the carry?
[2023-01-06 19:07:09] <%+BobDoorbell> is Emongg top 500?

I.E dropping 20k heals and lose

[2023-01-06 19:26:12] <+Steph_You_Up> @buggyyboo Focus in one thing at a time. Not dying will help with positioning and you'll eventually do more damage
[2023-01-06 19:26:15] <Zelda2sheik> If Sig can keep his distance with her, he's viable against her. Just can't get in her face cause she wins the brawl

[2023-01-06 19:54:25] <blobgiraffe> @Miketcha game sense wise yea but getting in as a new player swinging a hammer and shielding is decent to start with
[2023-01-06 19:54:26] <+LavaPancakes> dva is the easiest tank the rest require too much game sense to start right off the bat
[2023-01-06 19:54:31] <typingkid4k> and tactical visor is a rlly good super

[2023-01-06 21:06:36] <idle_on> JQ Carnage cooldown gets shorter when you attack ANY destructible item on the map. turrets, railings pots. if you hit ANY breakable thing, the cooldown drops by 2sec. so you can just carnage a few pots/railings for instant Carnage reset....
[2023-01-06 21:06:37] <%thats_so_rydon> probably 3 years out on ES6 since Starfield will be coming out

[2023-01-06 22:04:50] <Crosis86> not saying he wasnt cheating cause he might be but couldnt the echo shot there have just been random hanzo thing?
[2023-01-06 22:04:50] <%Presarius712> i love playing ramattra
[2023-01-06 22:05:00] <%Thugnite1> What tier would you put JQ in now after buffs @emongg ? emongM
[2023-01-06 22:05:05] <nerd1linger> I have 8 levels to go to unlock Rammy
[2023-01-06 22:05:07] <+hotasstwink> @crosis86 you vant even see hanzo. theres a tree. @crosis86
[2023-01-06 22:05:10] <+Moolah328> do you think 50 shield hp is enough for brig?
[2023-01-06 22:05:16] <+zunebug> Have you played the new arcade Olympus game mode?
[2023-01-06 22:05:17] <+Moolah328> +50 **
[2023-01-06 22:05:23] <+hotasstwink> you cant see snyone with that environment.  thats why its blantant obvious.
[2023-01-06 22:05:23] <Downstrait> firestrike 100 dmg, pin 225 dmg and rein's immediately a tier
[2023-01-06 22:05:32] <+SynthhInHD> @Crosis86 no, she wasn't even visible to him. That kind of shit is incredibly rare, but he was hitting everything very consistently.
[2023-01-06 22:05:35] <%+omnideoist> @Crosis86 if that were the only shot like that, maybe, but he kept getting 5ks with no misses and then followed up by nothing but misses for a minute and a half, rinse and reapet
[2023-01-06 22:05:37] <%Nennai> @Crosis86 the flick doesnt even look like it even arcs high enough for the arrow to fly that high
[2023-01-06 22:05:41] <JesseGreatJob> been thinking, sig and Lucio definitely have been the most balanced heroes for a while right? any others you can think of?
[2023-01-06 22:05:43] <+Moolah328> lmao fair, thanks dude
[2023-01-06 22:05:44] <%Presarius712> honestly her shield should be like 400
[2023-01-06 22:05:49] <+Necrosythe> brig just needs a different meta before any more buffs
[2023-01-06 22:05:59] <+Necrosythe> otherwise she just becomes flat OP
[2023-01-06 22:05:59] <%zonar_ow> 50 extra shield health HAS to make her B tier now, surely

[2023-01-06 22:06:39] <Crosis86> they really missed the mark on the olympus stuff could have taken 1 of if not all the skins and tied them to the 300 kills

[2023-01-06 22:07:21] <SquirrelArthur> Nice
[2023-01-06 22:07:27] <%zonar_ow> @Crosis86 yeah, but now you get a sick TITLE! isn't that satisfying? now go buy the skins please :)
[2023-01-06 22:07:37] <Crosis86> @Azure_Az all the chars are super beefed and ram is just bigger version of his normal self

[2023-01-06 22:08:08] <%Nennai> @IvanMacDeath that's if you get 20 each time, so your're looking at maybe double that per hero at least
[2023-01-06 22:08:10] <Crosis86> idk 300 kills per char for a title is ugh
[2023-01-06 22:08:15] <%+Azure_Az> @Crosis86 yeah true the water punchs are pretty cool though and his pullk is a mini sigma ULT IN THE SUPERCHARGED FORM
[2023-01-06 22:08:32] <%+tm_901> its insane
[2023-01-06 22:08:36] <ThePerplexedOne> Someone added an extra 0 by accident surely

[2023-01-06 22:08:43] <%Thugnite1> I wish they brought in a limited Highlight intro for Rein like they did with Widow and Hog.

[2023-01-06 22:08:51] <S1ren_ow> it's definitely a lot for each title but I'm kinda glad that not everyone's gonna have them
[2023-01-06 22:08:52] <Downstrait> widow one seems impossible with how hard she gets bullied
[2023-01-06 22:08:56] <Crosis86> then the fact they used an old mercy skin as the reward instead of 1 of the new skins is sad as hell
[2023-01-06 22:09:10] <+Necrosythe> for sure. 140 more SR or so
[2023-01-06 22:09:20] <%+tm_901> yeah tbh nothing wrong with things being hard to earn
[2023-01-06 22:09:25] <%+tm_901> at least gives them some worth

[2023-01-06 23:45:18] <$jjoshpalmz> @vent_yeahmanthatscool I’m confused y a mod would do that a gifted sub means more subs for emongg
[2023-01-06 23:45:18] <PsykoMetricz> there's cruise ships with mini subs in them now

[2023-01-06 23:45:52] <+VentusWK> @ninisaaa emongg's dps is somewhere in masters i think
[2023-01-06 23:45:53] <@%AwCrap> @jjoshpalmz don't ask for gifted subs, it's weird. If someone wants to gift you for adding value to chat, they will
