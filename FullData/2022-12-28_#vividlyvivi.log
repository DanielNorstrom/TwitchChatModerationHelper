[2022-12-28 01:22:26] <OmegaUltima_> Fallout 3 got banned originally here because all the drugs were their real world counterparts until Bethesda went back to using things like MedX
[2022-12-28 01:22:26] <%Dragonator_g> So it's not banning, it's shunning.

[2022-12-28 02:01:19] <OmegaUltima_> It was harder back then I suppose, expecting that you need to dub it. These days you can just put subtitles on, that's all anyone really wants at the end of the day

[2022-12-28 02:01:44] <%durell_vt> I used to love dub but now I do prefer sub
[2022-12-28 02:01:45] <%gabriebob> @HunterSopko still true, especially in Japan where a Bluray part 1 of the season is over 100 USD

[2022-12-28 02:01:58] <OmegaUltima_> Dubs got better over time, because back then every anime dub was almost a stage performance of yelling
[2022-12-28 02:02:10] <%Waldinflesh> the more you get into the rabbit hole the more you don't want dubs
[2022-12-28 02:02:15] <ZillaOmega> I imagine the ppl who want dubs are ones that have a condition where they can't read the subtitles
[2022-12-28 02:02:15] <%gabriebob> Sub vs Dub depends on the people, i am dyslexic, can't enjoy subs cos well, it takes me too long to Read, i don't get to watch the show
[2022-12-28 02:02:15] <%FreedomFallout> I've never been a fan of dubs
[2022-12-28 02:02:16] <%SilentShadow952> I just like seeing voice actors getting a chance to have work
[2022-12-28 02:02:20] <%durell_vt> but dubs are great if I wanna switch off and do other things whilst is on
[2022-12-28 02:02:23] <%robinthebobbin99> Depends on the show, honestly
[2022-12-28 02:02:29] <%Xarlaxas> I think that dubs are a lot higher quality these days. I prefer subs because I have to actually pay attention. vividLul
[2022-12-28 02:02:31] <Gerwich> I think more people accept dubs because the general quality is higher. I still prefer subs in most anime.

[2022-12-28 02:02:54] <%MelkorTheGreat> I like the Cowboy Bebop dub
[2022-12-28 02:02:59] <%gabriebob> i'm trying to learn japanese, but til then i HAVE to dub, cos Dyslexic
[2022-12-28 02:02:59] <%stevenqueiruga> Most of the times I like the subs
[2022-12-28 02:03:01] <%Geisterwand> My favourite dub is the Yugioh dub
[2022-12-28 02:03:01] <%Xarlaxas> Ohh, I'll have to check out the Haruhi dub. vividPogwow
[2022-12-28 02:03:02] <%durell_vt> newer dub has gotten alot better but they just cant get the voices right
[2022-12-28 02:03:02] <cabbeh> in general
[2022-12-28 02:03:07] <earin_copper> The PS&G dub is also excellent but tbh it's fun to watch both
[2022-12-28 02:03:08] <AbysswalkerTCG> Beck's dub is better than the sub
[2022-12-28 02:03:10] <@%BasketsEdits> It does depend for me. If I'm doing other things at the time then I'll watch dubs otherwise I'm fine with subs. Certain shows are better in sub though
[2022-12-28 02:03:10] <EpicMagikarp> i only issue with english dubs is that it's all American accents  fuwachAAA
[2022-12-28 02:03:11] <eveningmaster> So you're saying you like Crispen Freemen XD
[2022-12-28 02:03:12] <Gerwich> Cromartie high also has a perfect dub.
[2022-12-28 02:03:12] <Lexukun> It REALLY does depend.. i do have some series that i will prefer the dub.

[2022-12-28 02:03:16] <trash_on_the_wind> I tend to favor subs but if it's an anime with super fast talking I find it hard to keep up
[2022-12-28 02:03:16] <%Dragonator_g> Spy X Family Dub is a completely different show from sub.
[2022-12-28 02:03:20] <!%ModestNarcissus> Someone say subs??
[2022-12-28 02:03:22] <+ayysucesso> cromartie had a banger dub but I prefer subs
[2022-12-28 02:03:23] <%Geisterwand> Yugioh's dub changes the genre of the show completely and it's great
[2022-12-28 02:03:27] <HailDukeNukemBaby> I loved The Panty and Stocking Dub, also Kill la Kill dub
[2022-12-28 02:03:32] <OmegaUltima_> I can do both, there are some pretty good gems on both sides, but it depends who does it and how closely they get it.
[2022-12-28 02:03:33] <ZillaOmega> the Mario anime movie with Chris Pratt dub :)
[2022-12-28 02:03:41] <%robinthebobbin99> I think most of the time it's sub for me. Although there are some shows where I REALLY prefer the dub
[2022-12-28 02:03:42] <%thehousemasterr> vivi thought on the 4kids dub vs abridged dub?

[2022-12-28 02:05:08] <%FellyVT> Here's a thought: Dubs are good for people who can't stare at a screen for every episode verbatim.
[2022-12-28 02:05:08] <earin_copper> @HailDukeNukemBaby The biggest drawback of the Panty and Stocking dub IIRC is that you don't get Scanty and Kneesocks saying "rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrules"

[2022-12-28 02:09:25] <GrizzleBearMAK> I'm all for a Dub if it's good. Edgerunners had a pretty good Dub and I'd take more like it. But Dubs just have such a bad rep for being ass historically and many people just think they're all bad by default, or that it's a rite of passage to watch things Subbed and you aren't a real fan if you don't. If more dubs were good, the stigma around 'em would go away, so I'm all for it.

[2022-12-28 02:19:19] <HailDukeNukemBaby> @proteus_the_terrible You need to able to drown at least 3 people to be humongous
[2022-12-28 02:19:19] <chico421> jupiter?
[2022-12-28 02:19:44] <%Dragonator_g> Can you have a stream going at the same time on twitch redirecting people to the picarto stream with something like a placeholder graphic?
[2022-12-28 02:19:51] <Proteus_the_Terrible> DROWN people?

[2022-12-28 02:20:19] <%MelkorTheGreat> I think it would count as a multistream and be against TOS
[2022-12-28 02:20:30] <HailDukeNukemBaby> @proteus_the_terrible when we say humongous we mean it
[2022-12-28 02:20:45] <Proteus_the_Terrible> No, I mean how do they get "drowned"?

[2022-12-28 02:21:09] <Proteus_the_Terrible> I think "smother" would be a more accurate word.
[2022-12-28 02:21:22] <unchainedfallen> well thats one way to die
[2022-12-28 02:21:22] <HailDukeNukemBaby> suffocated also works but you can drown in a large number of them legit

[2022-12-28 02:37:24] <%gabriebob> @HailDukeNukemBaby Picarto started out as an artist streaming site, back before twitch supported artists, since twitch supported artists it just became a looser NSFW friendly streaming site with a LOT of furry artists
[2022-12-28 02:37:33] <HailDukeNukemBaby> The top 5 streams are in the Furry Category

[2022-12-28 02:38:39] <%gabriebob> @HailDukeNukemBaby furries are the rich part of the internet, they basically singlehandedly pay for Picarto's upkeep costs, pretty much any site that suppoers the furries will find itself not having too many financial problems

[2022-12-28 02:53:53] <%Dawnstryder> it is definitely one of those jrpg farming games lol
[2022-12-28 02:53:58] <!%chesspwn> rune factory 5
[2022-12-28 02:54:08] <%Dragonator_g> Yeah. The most difficult part is logistics and fulfillment. Getting one or 1000 made is relatively easy compared to getting them to people all over the world.
