[2022-12-07 16:28:47] <@%+Shikiro> Swift Bard 4x3 is Desperate/Awakening/Expert/Heavy Armor
[2022-12-07 16:29:07] <@%+Shikiro> Then Choice of Vital Point or Drops of Ether
[2022-12-07 16:29:11] <%+Kreisenberg> you can do vital as 5th, but only if you need to do a lot of stagger in the raids
[2022-12-07 16:29:23] <%+Kreisenberg> drops of ether is mory utility for the team
[2022-12-07 16:29:39] VIEWERS: 956

[2022-12-07 16:30:02] <@%+Shikiro> If I had Vital Point, I could solo stagger Kakul as my Bard. Sadge I think it's possible without, but it is hard

[2022-12-07 16:30:43] <%andredablio> @Shikiro I tried it multiple times, I don't think it's possible Sadge I need vital point too

[2022-12-07 17:21:23] <%jaded2355> @Shikiro yeh thats why my reaper is at 1472 because people always gatekeep. base on class nowadays
