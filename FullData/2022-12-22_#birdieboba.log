[2022-12-22 09:21:49] <%disrupted__sphinx> Frank is such an evil name it puts fear into the hearts of all who hear ot
[2022-12-22 09:21:59] <%torrrrrnado> @torrrrrnado yes and no. i really only need it to differentiate foe from friend (ie name colors) but its not completely game changing
[2022-12-22 09:22:09] <@%kdlutz> really good games will have options for all types of colour blindess, not just the most common
[2022-12-22 09:22:11] <@%kdlutz> types
[2022-12-22 09:22:23] <%SirPotatoStorm> is birdy have a PRO gamer Form ?
[2022-12-22 09:22:30] <@%kdlutz> ofc
[2022-12-22 09:22:30] <%torrrrrnado> a lot of games have differnt options for different forms of color blind
[2022-12-22 09:22:38] <@%syckbrs> i'd say the 3d model is pretty gamer

[2022-12-22 09:23:01] <%torrrrrnado> at the end of the day, games are pretty simple...if they attack you, you attack back hahaha

[2022-12-22 09:24:45] <%torrrrrnado> @disrupted__sphinx exactly, and even if something is color based a lot of games nowadays also put shapes in to help with that.

[2022-12-22 09:39:45] <@%^Streamlabs> Tengu are a type of legendary creature found in Japanese folklore. They are a type of mischievous supernatural being. They are traditionally depicted with both human and avian (bird like) characteristics. Birdie is 50% human, 50% Tengu, and a 100% gremlin. Also those are horns on her head, not panda ears.

[2022-12-22 10:50:10] <@%^Streamlabs> Birdie has a neurological disorder called "visual snow", she constantly sees the world in static. It makes things harder for her to see, especially in the dark. Visual snow causes letters to blur together making it hard for Birdie to read out loud. If you want to learn more about Visual Snow this is a great article! https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/visual-snow-syndrome/

[2022-12-22 11:29:24] <%+mdkubit> @mdkubit I think that was the original intent behind the name, but it also applies to 'tingles' as a feeling, because it's part of the same response "system" in your body.

[2022-12-22 11:30:26] <%+mdkubit> For me, I get the tingles specifically if the sound hits a certain low frequency. Some of the sounds hit it, the others just are soothing and relaxing in general. :)
[2022-12-22 11:30:30] <%disrupted__sphinx> Idk why I went with egg but here we are
[2022-12-22 11:30:43] <%+AggroTheYokai> but i used my prime love your asmr :D
[2022-12-22 11:30:48] <%+mdkubit> As a kid, I'd get it whenever I got a haircut and they used the electric clippers near the end. That would make my arms go all weird tingly. :D
[2022-12-22 11:31:00] <%reivehnfliyt> You know what's even grosser? Zefrank1 youtube video on "true facts about"... well most animals featured in that series. but they're educational, memorable and fun to watch if you get the time, i recommend watching them with Ren in your free time, i guarantee some laughs.
[2022-12-22 11:31:03] <%disrupted__sphinx> I either don‚Äôt get tingles or don‚Äôt know what they are
