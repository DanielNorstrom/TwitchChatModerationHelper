[2022-12-19 09:22:48] <%Thelete> Bwop TeaTime morning
[2022-12-19 10:00:07] <%Thelete> any mikers this week?
[2022-12-19 15:35:00] <%voldar_fumbledink> Office destroyed? D:
[2022-12-19 15:35:21] <%TheRealJinjix> we getting a stream soon!? Office destruction sounds really bad... I wonder how bad it flooded, being on the not ground floor
[2022-12-19 15:36:05] <%voldar_fumbledink> It was likely rain then I guess?
[2022-12-19 15:36:25] <%TheRealJinjix> Ah yeah, flooding from the top, yikes
[2022-12-19 15:37:22] <%TheRealJinjix> I can only imagine how they found out like Chris going in to work and being like "Oh fuck..."
[2022-12-19 15:37:34] <%voldar_fumbledink> Yeah indeed
[2022-12-19 15:37:50] <Voltekka15a2> I hope the equipment made it out safely

[2022-12-19 15:38:13] <%Tossberg> Hope you fellas get the Office sorted with minimum damage <3
[2022-12-19 15:38:40] <%TheRealJinjix> I wonder how it even happened. Like what kind of ceiling holes/cracks/leaks would have to be there to flood it.
[2022-12-19 15:38:54] <%voldar_fumbledink> Discord says it was a burst pipe, maybe frozen?
[2022-12-19 15:39:54] <%Thefatkid145> Bwop
[2022-12-19 15:40:21] <%TheRealJinjix> I'm terrible at keeping up with Discords, didn't see that... sucks either way. Hopefully there's not too much damage that can't be sorted reletively easily.
