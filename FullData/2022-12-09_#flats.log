[2022-12-09 00:43:56] <RianaFelblade> @benrkellar2 Idk, orb + succ does a decent amount if her movement is good.
[2022-12-09 00:43:59] <ChChChChiyo> @Skyzok1 I believe a primary issue is that the general utility she brings to the team is very selfish. Although you need to do some damage to heal, she doesn't have lots to provide. In comparison, Mercy +Zen bring dmg boost in different ways, Lucio and Brig bring "keep away" playstyles, etc.

[2022-12-09 17:33:04] <flipperg_> been playing splatoon for 7 years and its so deserved
[2022-12-09 17:33:09] <sleeperrnick> they should nerf genji since they did not get the award
[2022-12-09 17:33:09] <+PineappleOverlord9k> @Flats the real question tho is what squid would yuo wanna fuck if you played splatoon
[2022-12-09 17:33:10] <Bright_raf> found the number 2 FeelsWeirdMan
[2022-12-09 17:33:12] <+BizzleFoShizzle> they made everybody mad maybe there's an award for that
[2022-12-09 17:33:13] <javader332> dont do it to yourself or the others
[2022-12-09 17:33:13] <+dookieshoes93> Splatoon makes me rage more than OW ranked though. I‚Äôm so bad!

[2022-12-09 17:34:35] <soord_n_boord> @flats I think Ram could use some CD reductions on his shield and E, as opposed to "more damage," thoughts?

[2022-12-09 17:35:07] <chaosflame1> Hi guys
[2022-12-09 17:35:10] <+Shalaladida> I boycott splatoon, a game I bought and could play online for free and then they make online sub. F that out of principe.
[2022-12-09 17:35:14] <+BizzleFoShizzle> @reversecrab yeah i dropped genshin last month after i realized what they did to my boy scara & also i realized the general Issues with the game whilst writing an essay on gacha addiction LMAOOOO
[2022-12-09 17:35:19] <%lzimmlive> I play on Nintendo Switch cause it's all I have to play on.
[2022-12-09 17:35:19] <samii_b01_> @nymph0ow Yeah, sonic fans mades memes about genshin, then they both wanted blood
[2022-12-09 17:35:23] <Zee_Guy> I was expected Ramattra to have a meter for nemesis like Defense Matrix rather than a cooldown
[2022-12-09 17:35:26] <Drmmiillk> yo why does your game look so great
[2022-12-09 17:35:26] <soord_n_boord> facts
[2022-12-09 17:35:27] <flipperg_> fair enough
[2022-12-09 17:35:27] <%+Fullmetalbeng> true
[2022-12-09 17:35:28] <tv1light> ppl who own a switch are some weird mfs imo
[2022-12-09 17:35:29] <%SaraSlaught3r> true
[2022-12-09 17:35:32] <%RoadRunner27> switch is casual
[2022-12-09 17:35:34] <+dookieshoes93> In Japan it is
[2022-12-09 17:35:34] <barebonesdm> Other than smash
[2022-12-09 17:35:36] <soord_n_boord> it's just the "portable"
[2022-12-09 17:35:36] <+RedBeardll> Nintendo is not interested in esports anyway
[2022-12-09 17:35:43] <%+Fullmetalbeng> @RoadRunner27 this
[2022-12-09 17:35:44] <%+sierramarlee> it's the thing you play Mario party with your friends on tbh
[2022-12-09 17:35:46] <the_scranton_stranglerx> My bro plays moria on switch
[2022-12-09 17:35:47] <+ididnotgoogle> switch has smash bros which is like the biggest fighting game comp scene
[2022-12-09 17:35:47] <barebonesdm> I agree
[2022-12-09 17:35:47] <+Shalaladida> 5 Ram ults is kinda terrifying, or 4 and a Lucio boost.
[2022-12-09 17:35:53] <e_m_a_8> Smash bros, kinda mario kart, and def splatoon, but that's about it

[2022-12-09 17:35:56] <+PineappleOverlord9k> we need a switch 2 that has the power of a ps4 pro or xbox 1 series x something for switch 2

[2022-12-09 17:35:57] <%Keystone4274> I do sadge
[2022-12-09 17:35:57] <blue_tetris> Nintendo's iron grip on its communities probably lends to that.
[2022-12-09 17:35:58] <%+SuperNamekian> 100% true. The switch is what I play when I wanna feel the nostalgia of how gaming used to be.
[2022-12-09 17:35:59] <wonjers44> when people think of competitive smash its mostly on the gamecube
[2022-12-09 17:36:01] <%SaraSlaught3r> @tv1light nah, we dont judge like that here, we game here.
[2022-12-09 17:36:03] <barebonesdm> They stay in their own lane

Within his first week there, someone else on the team ended up crossing a line and pissing Flats off. Flats flattened the kid with his 6ft body, thus earning him the nickname "Flats" since "Flatten" sounds stupid.

[2022-12-09 17:59:12] <mojo0040> @rabidraider19 yeah he gets out of stuff way too easily. id say at the very least bring him down to 600, and a few more seconds cooldown on the heal so he has to be more calculated with his plays.
[2022-12-09 17:59:14] <%Hakuna_Mufasa> @beatingyacheeks theyre not even in his area Sadge
