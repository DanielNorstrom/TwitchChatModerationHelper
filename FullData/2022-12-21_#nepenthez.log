[2022-12-21 19:20:10] <Acampbell854> The cards in this game don‚Äôt excite me anymore Its just like a cosmetic at this point. I do the stupid picks or SBCs for the curiosity of what player I‚Äôll get and I like doing SBCs but I never use many players.
[2022-12-21 19:20:11] <+RazorKameo> 20+ chem imo is good enough

[2022-12-21 19:22:15] <+BloodBucketz> la liga might work
[2022-12-21 19:22:18] <jezfi> Should just remove chem all together. Silly to call it 'Ultimate team' if you get punished for building your 'ultimate team'.

[2022-12-21 19:23:03] <bizo9> hi nep, i feel like the power curve in this game is way too high and by the end we need like 105 OVR players to make the difference in the late stage of the game

[2022-12-21 19:40:05] <CraigMcD13> you've got to wonder how miserable their actual lives are if they have to do this when they win a game of Fifa
[2022-12-21 19:40:10] <boomwap5499> Is it me or is the ability to intercept a pass manually almost gone. I played a game and almost didn‚Äôt try to defend and I seemed to get it back more. Anyone else got any thoughts on defending?

[2022-12-21 19:40:47] <000skeletor000> @boomwap5499 the game punishes you for manually defending. You have to move your player towards the opponent then switch off and let the Ai intercept

[2022-12-21 19:41:52] <+amandamac1007> So if they don‚Äôt upgrade goalkeepers composure and reactions are they worth upgrading over the gold?
[2022-12-21 19:41:53] <Erzu97> @manlikecech_33 I'd say it is. The card is not expensive but still really good ingame

[2022-12-21 19:44:44] <gorgeousporgeous> i normally do this every end of season but im on like 20 cba
[2022-12-21 19:44:51] <m4nny1403> He‚Äôs just sat there I think
[2022-12-21 19:44:54] <%+jjw98__> I need someone to do this for me lol I need one more win but everyone I‚Äôm playing is an absolute demon for some reason
[2022-12-21 19:44:54] <boomwap5499> Give him the ball on pen spot. All others will do the exaggerated ball roll. Wonder if EA could put in if you‚Äôve conceded 10 goals the game quits for you
[2022-12-21 19:44:59] <%+Downtroddenz> hold the ball
[2022-12-21 19:45:00] <jpompeo40> I don‚Äôt understand why they don‚Äôt just quit after you score a goal. This happened to me multiple times today and it‚Äôs frustrating because it‚Äôs so boring.
[2022-12-21 19:45:02] <%+Downtroddenz> yeah kick out
[2022-12-21 19:45:02] <DaarkHuunter> could be holding r2

[2022-12-21 19:56:06] <%AHumanAlien> This work in Squad battles?
[2022-12-21 19:56:09] <henleys_magic> This is what FIFA has become. two people sat not playing the game for a pack that'll most likely contain nothing. what has the FIFA community become. Sad
[2022-12-21 19:56:11] <+rokerjoker_> Someone will spend 8 hours doing this today and end up with a few 84's
[2022-12-21 19:56:11] <+khan_victed> If I only had like 4 games to go and din't need wins I would too I think TBF

[2022-12-21 19:56:15] <BigTTamko> like it should disconnect the other player for not moving towards the ball imo

[2022-12-21 19:56:27] <+adsiow> thats why he said literally
[2022-12-21 19:56:30] <%+gourjamz> The thing is EA have made it so there is no incentive to actually play if u have ur 8 wins and don‚Äôt want to go up another division

[2022-12-21 19:57:05] <bizo9> yeah i get you but it takes like 30 seconds to get into the game and then 12 to 15 minutes you do something
[2022-12-21 19:57:06] <%Creativename_> on a scale of something to nothing he is like 99% towards nothing
[2022-12-21 19:57:08] <%blazer33x> wait
[2022-12-21 19:57:10] <%+big_mcmatt> People get literally and figuratively wrong

[2022-12-21 19:57:12] <%$BobbyTambling> i think he was exagerating to make a point
[2022-12-21 19:57:12] <+rokerjoker_> Literally doing nothing would be if the Playstation turned itself on and entered the game mode
[2022-12-21 19:57:14] <+graff26lf> I can't loe I afk for 8 games earlier and did some housework, my opponent gets the win I get things done or the rage quit and gets you a game played

But recently just got back to this fifa thing because of the cup. Missed you because you were basically part of my childhood Cheer100 Cheer100 Cheer100

[2022-12-21 20:23:49] <zongorpista> how will you compete in Champs? spamming rivals?
[2022-12-21 20:24:04] <%H0NKTV> is it not annoying if some redeems TTS whilst your filiming a YT or does the sound not carry over?
[2022-12-21 20:24:12] <+thescampi> Antakayi also has a token card for WC swaps
[2022-12-21 20:24:33] <here4rewards_> @eric_bailly_nincompoop Nep is doing the full 4 hours now
[2022-12-21 20:24:38] <+CrackerJackMatt> I heard there is going to be a  Jairzinho sbc. Is this true?
[2022-12-21 20:24:40] <emmettoc> For the red world cup players do we get the level when end up on or the level we are on and all before? On the screen it says earn all 10 levels
[2022-12-21 20:24:43] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> @zongorpista He just has 4 hours to build the team. He can then qualify by rivals spamming and then use the same team for Champs. So the speed run part is just about getting the team together

[2022-12-21 22:10:56] <VladyB19> Not that is really matters but is it an rtg if you use the fifa points from the ultimate edition but dont buy ?
[2022-12-21 22:11:03] <%+xqtJack> dont you need a totw player for di maria or no?
[2022-12-21 22:11:08] <StepzyLad> What did u enjoy better fifa 17 or 18 nep?

[2022-12-21 22:11:22] <+Renny_G> @VladyB19 yes it still is as you didn't purchase the fifa points after the game came out
[2022-12-21 22:11:25] <%+Kieran96cfc> maybe dont open the tifos ect
[2022-12-21 22:11:30] <+Cavacom> @VladyB19 some people say yes but its up to u

[2022-12-21 22:41:26] <+Jeeves14> it does mean ur sprint is less consistent as u may not be pressing the trigget 100% but also it has the advantage of letting u sprint at <100% and not take such heavy touches

[2022-12-21 23:56:06] <+zaneyj98> 81 x11 seems awful
[2022-12-21 23:56:06] <%+riff_hunter44> 81 sucks ass
[2022-12-21 23:56:07] <+FreddieG_TV> Don‚Äôt play it safe - it‚Äôs a fun challenge
[2022-12-21 23:56:14] <%mannyn90> I would say trippier the 81x11 looks horrible from all the ones I‚Äôve seen
[2022-12-21 23:56:14] <%$ItsTr3ple> Walker > Trippier
[2022-12-21 23:56:15] <lpd1996> what are people going for? im looking at the 85+ WW pick
[2022-12-21 23:56:17] <jimmothycheeseburger> Trippier, but you do need chem for him I recon

[2022-12-21 23:56:21] <%+bropezzz> I‚Äôve never seen a good 81x11 yet. Trippier is the safe bet for sure
[2022-12-21 23:56:26] <%Dezalleycat> 81x 11 for the fodder and then it‚Äôs only 2 more for tripps
