STEP 2 Make a well in the centre, then add 3 tbsp olive oil and 300ml water, and mix well. If the dough seems a little stiff, add another 1-2 tbsp water and mix well.  STEP 3 Tip onto a lightly floured work surface and knead for around 10 mins.  STEP 4 Once the dough is satin-smooth, place it in a lightly oiled bowl and cover with cling film. Leave to rise for 1 hour until doubled

[2023-01-09 02:31:02] <%$Dio444777> jurassic park was 93. i was 9 years old and obsessed with dinosaurs at the time
[2023-01-09 02:31:05] <!%eevee133eevee> you don't put mascara on your dog to let others know it's a girl? Kappa

[2023-01-09 02:31:36] <ClammsCove> I was literally 1 month old when jurassic park came out
[2023-01-09 02:32:25] <%$Dio444777> remember tim, the kid in the movie who's a dinosaur nerd and names all the species when he sees them? i was him lol
[2023-01-09 02:33:00] <!%eevee133eevee> speaking of mascara on dogs, I may potentially be moving to my mom's house to the downstairs apartment next year and we can get a doggo.
