[2023-01-05 08:04:29] <@^Nightbot> God clown girls are so hot. First you pull down her pants and she squirts water in your eyes. Then she says "Don't worry, I brought protection for you" and she pulls a chain of 100 condoms from out of her empty palm. Finally, when she's going to put the condom on with her mouth instead she quickly blows the condom up into a balloon dog.

[2023-01-05 08:37:08] <+IKnowThatMyUserIsVeryLong> Chain smoking is the practice of smoking several cigarettes in succession, sometimes using the ember of a finished cigarette to light the next. The term chain smoker often also refers to a person who smokes relatively constantly, though not necessarily chaining each cigarette.

[2023-01-05 08:40:23] <!%+ajingus> but the allure of it isn't a kink thing specifically its more that you can cum with your balls or something

[2023-01-05 10:38:03] <Mewdels> When I was young I wanted to wear normal clothes. But Mother knows best and would put me in what she thought would look nice. "Matching Coloured Clothes" was what Mother wanted, and I wanted to wear a sapphire coloured polo-neck (tube neck) top, white choc (off white) Adidas tracksuit, Blue Leather Adidas mid tops (ankle support), and a White Adidas Tennis visor (with the velcro backstrap)... I was a very Peculiar kid when I was 6, in 1989.

[2023-01-05 10:45:05] <!%+ajingus> pre jon leaving was better Dan just kinda does nothing most of the time
[2023-01-05 10:45:07] <%+foppy78> they definitely got a lot better over the years
[2023-01-05 10:45:08] <!%garfield1187> i think dan just has great energy
