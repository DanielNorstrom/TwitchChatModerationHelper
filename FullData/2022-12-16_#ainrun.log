[2022-12-16 05:42:50] <@%^Nightbot> The runner either has to complete a full row/column/diagonal or get the most squares on the board to win. Lockout rules prevent runners from getting squares if someone else has already got them. The run also has to be done glitchless.

[2022-12-16 06:46:22] <@%^Nightbot> The runner either has to complete a full row/column/diagonal or get the most squares on the board to win. Lockout rules prevent runners from getting squares if someone else has already got them. The run also has to be done glitchless.

[2022-12-16 08:34:17] <@%EnSevenTea> Off the top of my head I can't think of something but relatively speaking the tiles on the board you can get by progressing the game. But more stuff like going to misbegotten, for example, doesn't progress the game. And you have to go out of your way to get it
[2022-12-16 08:34:29] <Ohad9631> how about reaching some isolated merchants?

[2022-12-16 10:05:27] <%MeMadeFox> So just go +9
[2022-12-16 10:06:00] <SkepticTanker> !bingo
[2022-12-16 10:06:00] <@%^Nightbot> The runner either has to complete a full row/column/diagonal or get the most squares on the board to win. Lockout rules prevent runners from getting squares if someone else has already got them. The run also has to be done glitchless.
[2022-12-16 10:06:04] <%amazingballs1> no i def encourage getting +9 because if he gets it before you, you basically lose
[2022-12-16 10:06:07] <%$scribblesofa> Do you have a somber weapon to upgrade and take into the right?
[2022-12-16 10:06:07] <%MeMadeFox> should you just pick up SH?
