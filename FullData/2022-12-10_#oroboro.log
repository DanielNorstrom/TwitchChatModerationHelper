[2022-12-10 01:33:29] <@%Pallydan9K> it probably works like ds2's where it tries to match you with someone normal and then eventually finds whoever
[2022-12-10 01:33:33] <%$loran_cleric> in ds2, the aura tiers were like rank floors
[2022-12-10 01:33:38] <@%Pallydan9K> BUT it might just bypass levels entirely if you use a password at all
[2022-12-10 01:33:39] <%lolmato010> @sir_varg ayyo?!?

[2022-12-10 02:34:15] <Nyanbro> caestus use an animation cancel to hit like 5 right?

[2022-12-10 02:54:26] <!%Ebonslayer> @NeededElsweyr_ In some ways they are. Look at what you're sacrificing for it in here: poise and damage reduction.

[2022-12-10 03:03:22] <SkottHv> @Nyanbro eeeeh that would cause problems, in high level play being able to make out there build in an instance can be very benificial so if they were different colors that would just make it impossible if not harder

[2022-12-10 03:05:41] <thedopestjedi> People tend to panic roll against this build I’ve noticed. Easier to roll catch them too.
[2022-12-10 03:05:41] <ClawsOfLyco> If you win with any weapon that means it's cheap :)

[2022-12-10 03:19:50] <!%Ebonslayer> @soggyxox That's aimpunch. This game has an annoying quirk where if you get hit your weapon will be thrown around mid-attack. This can cause a complete miss for attacks with a small hitbox like thrusts or downwards strikes.

[2022-12-10 03:20:07] <kingcon315> How does the ranking work? People keep leaving combat when they lose in duels so it doesn’t affect their rank?
[2022-12-10 03:20:17] <Dottie3M> @v1cirylyt Oro doesnt hate them because he counter them hard
[2022-12-10 03:20:23] <soggyxox> that explains alot ebon because I feel I have no chance sometimes hitting

[2022-12-10 03:21:28] <%+anarkeiii> dragon breath is worse imo
[2022-12-10 03:21:36] <%x2spooky4me> so apparently you can use starlight shards in the arena and its totally not broken or anything

[2022-12-10 03:29:46] <+captain_balrick> @captain_balrick Because I enjoy the more chaotic team modes. I don't *want* to duel, the thread is about disconnects forcing unbalanced teams. 3v3 turns into a 2v3 or even a 1v3, etc.
[2022-12-10 03:29:46] <Einosuke_Kinslayer> maybe Zelda hit away a dead body

[2022-12-10 03:30:08] <renandrill> If they are those bathroom flies, they're probably feeding off organisms growing in your drain or bathroom
[2022-12-10 03:30:11] <EwesNah> if you have an outdoor cat they bring friends home
[2022-12-10 03:30:15] <+Zsizihas> if you have any drains/sinks/baths that you don't use frequently, just run hot water down for 10~15 minutes or so
[2022-12-10 03:30:18] <renandrill> A clean up would solve it
[2022-12-10 03:30:32] <renandrill> If it is mosquitos, it might be a regional problem
[2022-12-10 03:30:36] <Oobidoob> a lot of people i know have them infesting them right now, i've tried traps annd boiling water andn can't get rid of them\
[2022-12-10 03:30:38] <+VanOnTheMoon> yeah just to check it our to make sure it doesn't become an issue
[2022-12-10 03:30:50] <%$Noob_Almost> the drain flies normally only pop up if you pour a lot of foodstuff type things down the drain. you see it in pubs where people get a bit lax about closing

[2022-12-10 03:31:05] <+House_013> There are tons of reasons there could be flies, one of which is a neighbor has something drawing them to the area, and they are finding their way into your house instead

[2022-12-10 03:35:42] <!%Ebonslayer> @soggyxox Not happening. ER is very different from DS2 so a lot of things wouldn't fit.
[2022-12-10 03:35:42] <%lolmato010> @dr_k3tchup nope it isn't

[2022-12-10 03:37:27] <%$Noob_Almost> i think a golden aura on spawn that goes away for the fight would send the message without being too "noisy"

[2022-12-10 03:37:44] <!%Ebonslayer> I think the ranks would have to be harder to earn if they did that. In DS2 you knew someone was good because they were glowing red, and you were at high risk of getting your ass beat. In this arena even I can reach max rank.
[2022-12-10 03:37:49] <Picuira> so is the spawn supposed to be silent or did they just fuck it up?
[2022-12-10 03:37:52] <jabrony67> noice noice

[2022-12-10 03:38:12] <Oobidoob> yeah i really hope they try to make ranks mean something at least
[2022-12-10 03:38:15] <soggyxox> didn't u need like 100 wins for the Bell Keeper outfit
[2022-12-10 03:38:27] <@%Pallydan9K> yes
[2022-12-10 03:38:27] <soggyxox> and a good win ratio for the better red auras
[2022-12-10 03:38:29] <!%Ebonslayer> @soggyxox Something like that, I think.

[2022-12-10 03:42:10] <junksprungs> siluria's tree isnt worth it
[2022-12-10 03:42:17] <!%Ebonslayer> @lolmato010 Hence why I'm saying, if they wanted to make ranks more visible, they'd have to be harder to attain.

[2022-12-10 03:43:14] <%lolmato010> @ebonslayer agree, they could also make more ranks but that would be too high effort

[2022-12-10 03:43:38] <!%Ebonslayer> @lolmato010 Maybe one more platinum rank and boost up the requirements of gold and silver by a ton.
[2022-12-10 03:43:47] <!%Ebonslayer> @lolmato010 Or add a bronze rank in there.
[2022-12-10 03:43:58] <%lolmato010> @ebonslayer I could get behind that

[2022-12-10 03:44:56] <%Qwozle> yay this build!
[2022-12-10 03:44:58] <!%Ebonslayer> @Fan_n1_de_Abbychuela In DS2 it really was a grind.
[2022-12-10 03:45:01] <%+ZeGreatPumpkinani> anyone else have this problem where when you eat spicy food it only makes you more hungry? I swear I can just keep eating hot wings till I'm crying and still want something after

[2022-12-10 03:45:11] <+Tortuga_GG> Guys, sorry if im asking too much but its worth to buy the ps5 version?
[2022-12-10 03:45:14] <%lolmato010> @fan_n1_de_abbychuela farming that damn glow with a 150 so character was fuckin hell
[2022-12-10 03:45:22] <heretic_acolyte> @tortuga_gg of course
[2022-12-10 03:45:24] <+Fan_n1_de_Abbychuela> @Fan_n1_de_Abbychuela It was, but holy cow how worth it I found to be seen as a cancerous tryhard when invading

[2022-12-10 03:45:59] <@%Pallydan9K> I hear the ps4 version runs really well on a ps5
[2022-12-10 03:46:00] <SkottHv> @Tortuga_GG Im confused by the question, is this compared to you getting it on pc instead or just getting the game in general?
[2022-12-10 03:46:04] <+Tortuga_GG> Vs pc
[2022-12-10 03:46:04] <!%Ebonslayer> @Fan_n1_de_Abbychuela I took those people not to be tryhards, but genuinely great players unless their equipment indicated otherwise.
[2022-12-10 03:46:13] <%lolmato010> even worse was the blue sentinel glow @fan_n1_de_abbychuela
[2022-12-10 03:46:19] <!%$Mohl97> oro loves doing moonveil samurai builds yes he does
[2022-12-10 03:46:33] <!%Ebonslayer> @Fan_n1_de_Abbychuela But if someone's using a thrusting sword or whatever I consider them a tryhard in the first place, regardless of glow.

[2022-12-10 03:48:02] <heretic_acolyte> @jabrony67 it’s the same game, just runs differently on each platform, performance wise

[2022-12-10 03:48:07] <@%Pallydan9K> @jabrony67 no uh I think you get both ps4 and ps5 versions if you buy the game for playstation but if you run the ps4 version on a ps5 then it runs really smoothly, not that I've had issues using the ps5 version
[2022-12-10 03:48:22] <!%Ebonslayer> @SkottHv Not really. ER on PS4 and PS5 effectively just have different graphical settings.

[2022-12-10 03:48:41] <%hokmon_> I found it kind of rough dueling with Silura's tree when I tried it on a similar build, feels like it just doesn't have enough damage for the speed in a dueling situation

[2022-12-10 04:12:10] <rakkoz> what RL is this?
[2022-12-10 04:12:12] <$yaboi_clav> well, it would stop and rank 3 iirc

[2022-12-10 04:15:04] <subashubadooba> Don't know if Peeve would really be interested in AC6, but he used to do retro streams. Would be a cool request to see him try out some of the originals in anticipation for AC6
[2022-12-10 04:15:09] <%hokmon_> he lost his composure too much after getting that cast stuffed

[2022-12-10 04:15:56] <%hokmon_> you use the ps4 version of the game on ps5, right? I might eventually get it if just for the more active playerbase
[2022-12-10 04:16:00] <subashubadooba> Unless he really gets into mechs
[2022-12-10 04:16:00] <@%Pallydan9K> No, Oro only has a tournament trophy

[2022-12-10 04:20:32] <Calpernius> I need to get better at roll catching. Super useful in 3v3’s
[2022-12-10 04:20:36] <subashubadooba> @yaboi_clav They had to buff colossals like four separate times to make them semi worthwhile LUL
[2022-12-10 04:20:49] <@%Pallydan9K> roll catching is an incredibly useful fundamental

[2022-12-10 04:21:39] <subashubadooba> @yaboi_clav Funny enough it's still too slow to reliably roll catch anyone with two brain cells and that's one of the only good moves on colossal swords besides the poke
[2022-12-10 04:21:47] <@%Pallydan9K> morgott's cursed sword is probably the best curved sword
[2022-12-10 04:21:47] <lou529> Is there a recommended level for new pvp system?

[2022-12-10 04:22:14] <Calpernius> @pallydan9k just cuz of the weapon art?
[2022-12-10 04:22:17] <$yaboi_clav> @subashubadooba that is just sad, but somewhat expected i guess.
[2022-12-10 04:22:20] <%puff7717> faith builds are the bomb

[2022-12-10 04:22:42] <@%Pallydan9K> well it also scales really well with arcane and is the lightest curved greatsword and it looks cool @Calpernius
[2022-12-10 04:22:44] <marzetty23> what build you going for now
[2022-12-10 04:22:54] <@%Pallydan9K> but yes

[2022-12-10 04:23:08] <Death_IP> @Pallydan9K Still: Due to their slash damage type and their low poise damage (compared to DS games), they are irrelevant for most content. Greatswords and greataxes work better in most  situations
[2022-12-10 04:23:13] <+calikush226> is eleanora poleblade still viable

[2022-12-10 04:24:30] <Death_IP> They have a diagonal swing, which misses half the time. Oh, how I loved the versatile moveset in DS 2. I played the Murakumo in every playthrough :D
[2022-12-10 04:24:35] <!%Ebonslayer> @Pallydan9K If it hits.
[2022-12-10 04:24:38] <Calpernius> I max out poise on my build. And use 2 greatswords to just swing through everything

[2022-12-10 04:25:05] <@%Pallydan9K> dual greatswords and max poise doesn't let you swing through everything

[2022-12-10 04:25:18] <Bloodysaint969> And bleed in souls games has two conditions: it either broken af or not working at all

[2022-12-10 05:03:12] <%$Loukillius> how did they buff the daggers?
[2022-12-10 05:03:22] <!%Ebonslayer> Even before the patch, no poise vs daggers was a death sentence.
[2022-12-10 05:03:22] <+THEPH0NECOMPANY> Can you roll catch with the 2x daggers? or is it all just close range fast pressure
[2022-12-10 05:03:24] <@%Pallydan9K> daggers faster now
[2022-12-10 05:03:30] <playboi_asim> @playboi_asim ah okay, they do seem a lot faster though
[2022-12-10 05:03:34] <ChaserVellian> did claws get buffed?
[2022-12-10 05:03:37] <!%Ebonslayer> @Loukillius Slightly faster and more forward momentum in attacks.
[2022-12-10 05:03:44] <!%Ebonslayer> @ChaserVellian Not as much as daggers.

[2022-12-10 05:04:08] <%$Loukillius> the forward momentum sounds interesting. I remember trying to make dual daggers work before and range was always an issue
[2022-12-10 05:04:16] <ChaserVellian> man, I was about to start a strength build, now I might just go dual daggers
[2022-12-10 05:04:16] <playboi_asim> gna have to try out blade of calling
[2022-12-10 05:04:31] <!%Ebonslayer> @Loukillius It's not much better, you're gonna have a bitch of a time roll catching.

[2022-12-10 05:05:05] <!%Ebonslayer> @Loukillius It's most noticable with the 1H R1s and all the running attacks. They cover a lot of distance.
[2022-12-10 05:05:17] <Calpernius> I feel like I’m doing better in 2v2’s than 3v3’s

[2022-12-10 05:05:45] <!%Ebonslayer> @Loukillius 1HR1s may or may not roll catch. Probably depends on latency.

[2022-12-10 05:06:42] <%$Loukillius> at least in my experience
[2022-12-10 05:06:54] <!%Ebonslayer> @Loukillius Depends on how laggy. I think daggers could only rollcatch with R1s in a perfect connection.
[2022-12-10 05:07:01] <Smugloosh> it has slightly more forward momentum iirc
[2022-12-10 05:07:03] <%$Loukillius> yeah thats what im thinking too

[2022-12-10 05:07:25] <+kamgonnacamp> @kamgonnacamp because of the crouch mechanic? dual spears and lances werent used that much in ds2
[2022-12-10 05:07:26] <!%Ebonslayer> @Loukillius Whereas even a straight sword can catch even with a mediocre connection.
[2022-12-10 05:07:34] <+kamgonnacamp> or is it a hit box issue

[2022-12-10 05:16:53] <Namalus20> DS2 PvP goated PogChamp
[2022-12-10 05:17:04] <%$Loukillius> what makes ds2 pvp better?
[2022-12-10 05:17:13] <%$Loukillius> the speed?
[2022-12-10 05:17:14] <Namalus20> @loukillius Balance
[2022-12-10 05:17:14] <%+anarkeiii> more balanced
[2022-12-10 05:17:25] <%hokmon_> dark souls 2 felt way too reactive
[2022-12-10 05:17:29] <+cappincheeks> Thanks for answering
[2022-12-10 05:17:30] <!%AuroraUnit486> dark souls 2 is objectively the best pvp
[2022-12-10 05:17:40] <%$Loukillius> ah i see. i only ever played the pve aspect of ds2
[2022-12-10 05:17:43] <%hokmon_> everyone just sitting there waiting to backstep every attack or bait you into doing something so they can banana parry
[2022-12-10 05:17:50] <rusticitrus> More balance has to come eventually…right?
[2022-12-10 05:17:51] <+Gabetono> the hit reg sucked but everything else was great, like weapon animations felt really good
[2022-12-10 05:17:52] <nuttt123456> The pvp area was better

[2022-12-10 05:18:03] <dawronia> I could go through college and get my degree in the time it takes you to stand up from a party in DS2 though. that shit felt way too long
[2022-12-10 05:18:10] <dawronia> parry*
[2022-12-10 05:18:11] <%$b1uewhirlwind> DS3 had some pretty solid duel pvp tho imo
[2022-12-10 05:18:13] <Namalus20> on another note, I'd like to see an update for Elden Ring where they add new enemies to NG+ cycles
[2022-12-10 05:18:13] <%+anarkeiii> i loved the two handed straight sword stance in ds2, i wish they brought it back
[2022-12-10 05:18:26] <+Yianyan> Might be a bad take but I would say DS2 Arena (layouts) were more flavourful than these Elden Ring ones.
[2022-12-10 05:18:31] <+boneloid> ds2 without soul memory :/
[2022-12-10 05:18:33] <Rennat47> I just learned you can draw in a duel if you die at the same time
[2022-12-10 05:19:00] <Felipe_smith8314> joga aí meu querido
[2022-12-10 05:19:01] <RiPCasEOG> ds1 was backstab fishing ds2 had more variety's different stances with 2 diff weapons only downside was soul memory thats about it
[2022-12-10 05:19:23] <Namalus20> Soul Memory saintrPathetic

[2022-12-10 05:20:32] <rockmih> @Namalus20 Even with SM you could get back to back invasions in DS2, Opt in pvp is waaaaaaaaaay worse than SM

[2022-12-10 05:20:58] <+Gabetono> My level 170 Character was matching with the same people my level 119 was matching with, seems above 100 is fair grounds below 200
[2022-12-10 05:21:04] <%$Professor87> What is the meta level for the arena? 125 or 150 or 200?
[2022-12-10 05:21:09] <the_musko> Freaking awesome
[2022-12-10 05:21:46] <+Gabetono> @Professor87 kinda depends on the build what level youll end up at

[2022-12-10 05:22:53] <%$Loukillius> unfortunate
[2022-12-10 05:23:02] <%hokmon_> toothpaste?
[2022-12-10 05:23:02] <DivineSSGaming> He would have to lower his physical damage output in order to proc it meaning not leveling the weapons

[2022-12-10 05:23:16] <+CTopTV> Dude what when did they add arena??
[2022-12-10 05:23:26] <%hokmon_> oh, I was just sort of tabbing in and missed that
[2022-12-10 05:23:26] <+Mac_McBride> @Loukillius like 20
[2022-12-10 05:23:30] <Frizerrl> Mac_McBride Because at the end of a duel one person is dead
[2022-12-10 05:23:33] <%$Loukillius> oh, BRUH
[2022-12-10 05:23:34] <the_musko> Do you prefer Arena over Invasions, now?

[2022-12-10 05:24:27] <the_musko> Like. 3 v3 ?
[2022-12-10 05:24:33] <%hokmon_> what about more free for all matches?
[2022-12-10 05:24:35] <+Mac_McBride> you cant invade?
[2022-12-10 05:24:35] <Calpernius> Hey that’s just your opinion man
[2022-12-10 05:24:37] <%hokmon_> are those more interesting?
[2022-12-10 05:24:50] <+Yianyan> I feel like free for alls and team fights might be more interesting
[2022-12-10 05:25:03] <b00dha> if you do  a team fight with summons, can u you summon latenna to ride a wolf summon?
[2022-12-10 05:25:17] <Calpernius> I feel like I’m having more fun in the arena. But i was always looking for right clubs

[2022-12-10 05:26:01] <halomaker6> they get too used to the tankiness
[2022-12-10 05:26:06] <rockmih> this blight build wont blight at all LUL
[2022-12-10 05:26:13] <Morber_Bot> Yeah. It looked like there'd be colosseum spectators and rewards and stuff. But no
[2022-12-10 05:26:18] <%+anarkeiii> you dont even get runes from arena fighting
[2022-12-10 05:26:19] <Calpernius> The incentive is your rank. That’s good enough, I guess

[2022-12-10 05:27:09] <rusticitrus> Incentive: more suffering

[2022-12-10 05:28:25] <RiPCasEOG> since there is no covenents there is no incentive for any invading or pvp
[2022-12-10 05:28:29] <mokaida> Arena isn’t just 1v1
[2022-12-10 05:28:31] <Mekonancer> Why not do 1v2s vs spirit ash users?

[2022-12-10 05:28:39] <ebbebobe> @Oroboro you can fight 5 people at the same time

[2022-12-10 05:31:04] <@%Peeve> it can be multiple against you and it's more hectic. If that's your issue then 1v1 will always be just that, FFA at least has chaos.

[2022-12-10 05:35:15] <!%Ebonslayer> @KOKOgyi111 Raw damage means less than status.
[2022-12-10 05:35:15] <Tiny_Axolotl> Milos has death blight?
[2022-12-10 05:35:15] <%+ChaseTheBroYT> i heard about the compass being off in invasions
[2022-12-10 05:35:24] <%+Setis_Dagre> You could always do FFA with chat, then you could have yourself 1v5! ;-)
[2022-12-10 05:35:30] <JagersAC0G> do u use the death mist or death lightning or just the duel weild
[2022-12-10 05:35:32] <!%Ebonslayer> @KOKOgyi111 Especially when that buildup can scale with Arcane.

[2022-12-10 05:35:39] <mathieugriggs> hey Oroboro, whats your opinion of morgott's cursed curved greatsword? ive been using it in my build and it feels pretty good
[2022-12-10 05:35:45] <%+ChaseTheBroYT> i didnt invade the past 2 days so didnt notice haha
[2022-12-10 05:35:46] <KOKOgyi111> @ebonslayer so status kicks ass more than raw dmg?

[2022-12-10 05:36:21] <ferWHAAAAT> what compass?
[2022-12-10 05:36:22] <%threothree> I guess invasions can be annoying as hell with a broken compass for sure
[2022-12-10 05:36:25] <+Irish_Trunks> if it feels good, go with it. Have fun!
[2022-12-10 05:36:27] <!%Ebonslayer> @KOKOgyi111 Yeah. It does a ton of damage, can proc very quickly, ignores rolls and stuns so you can get more hits than you might otherwise.
[2022-12-10 05:36:28] <mathieugriggs> yeah its pretty good at catching people
[2022-12-10 05:36:29] <ferWHAAAAT> oh

[2022-12-10 05:40:28] <!%Ebonslayer> @KOKOgyi111 Oh, you mean buildup. Due to the game's shit netcode you can hit someone in their roll animation. The iframes absorb the damage but status will build through these iframes.
[2022-12-10 05:40:28] <Smooth3three> Do you use incantations in pvp ?

[2022-12-10 05:41:30] <!%Ebonslayer> @KOKOgyi111 They won't do damage, but it will actually cancel the roll if it hits full and apply the stun. Something curved sword users in particular abuse.

[2022-12-10 05:48:32] <mathieugriggs> hey oroboro, how would u rate the overall drip of elden ring's armors?
[2022-12-10 05:48:46] <!%Ebonslayer> @KungFuAndrew Oh, gotcha. Correct in both cases.
[2022-12-10 05:48:56] <+vezzevv> level ranges seem to be the same as with invasions
[2022-12-10 05:49:02] <Inekura> @vezzevv thanks
[2022-12-10 05:49:07] <Calpernius> I keep wanting to try HTS and other big pokers, but I haven’t gotten the hang of it yet
[2022-12-10 05:49:28] <!%Ebonslayer> Probably a message rating if I had to guess.
[2022-12-10 05:49:46] <+THEPH0NECOMPANY> So Erdsteel daggers have innate faith on them so with 60 faith and flame art i have 522 AR on each of them this is kinda dumb lol
[2022-12-10 05:49:48] <!%Ebonslayer> Oh, interesting.
[2022-12-10 05:49:58] <%hokmon_> ow

[2022-12-10 05:50:31] <Calpernius> I love the erdsteel dagger. I used it for a while in invasions because it’s so light + strong
[2022-12-10 05:50:44] <+vezzevv> I wonder if the firebolt will get nerfed in the future
[2022-12-10 05:50:57] <rockmih> was that guy trying to hit his teammate KEKW
[2022-12-10 05:51:09] <!%Ebonslayer> @vezzevv Giantsflame Take Thee? Probably not, it's fairly balanced in actuality.
[2022-12-10 05:51:37] <+vezzevv> @ebonslayer I agree. just see lots of people complaining

[2022-12-10 05:52:12] <+vezzevv> waves of gold could deffo do with an area nerf tho
[2022-12-10 05:52:23] <+vezzevv> it's a bit wide
[2022-12-10 05:52:28] <%KungFuAndrew> Did you just i-frame the heal?
[2022-12-10 05:52:32] <%+primal_xl> they may nerf the dual catalyst stacking damage though cuz 2k dmg fireballs is just stupid
[2022-12-10 05:53:02] <!%Ebonslayer> @primal_xl Maybe. I do think bonuses shouldn't be stackable.
[2022-12-10 05:53:17] <+St_Kushburn> i feel like im getting dumber watching this
[2022-12-10 05:53:18] <!%Ebonslayer> @primal_xl Or at least only apply when cast with that catalyst.
[2022-12-10 05:53:26] <$JagersAC0G> dang u almost had the backstab

[2022-12-10 05:53:46] <kaztheunbreakable> theres a million scummy ways to play. choose one or get left behind
[2022-12-10 05:53:56] <kaztheunbreakable> is my take

[2022-12-10 05:54:08] <!%Ebonslayer> @kaztheunbreakable Then there's me with my meme CKS build kicking ass.
[2022-12-10 05:54:17] <ferWHAAAAT> imo the only real scummy way to play is abusing a bug or glitch
[2022-12-10 05:54:17] <mikehoncho8567> nobody wants to fight with ghost friends on sadCat
[2022-12-10 05:54:20] <%KungFuAndrew> Not seeing much RoB in arena, interestingly
[2022-12-10 05:54:21] <ferWHAAAAT> the rest is just in the game
[2022-12-10 05:54:37] <kaztheunbreakable> @ferWHAAAAT exactly
[2022-12-10 05:54:45] <$JagersAC0G> @kaztheunbreakable yeah true but also if u can get kills with less used still strong weapons its pretty fun
[2022-12-10 05:54:48] <ferWHAAAAT> there are definitely boring ways to play though LUL
[2022-12-10 05:55:03] <dustnoise> damn i love the boulder/pickaxe build
[2022-12-10 05:55:06] <the_musko> I love it when you acknowledge other 'gamers'
[2022-12-10 05:55:10] <kaztheunbreakable> @JagersAC0G agreed
[2022-12-10 05:55:18] <blazedarca9> are you doing weapon art only? lol
[2022-12-10 05:55:39] <+Arkantoscream> is my low level 80 faith 10 waves of piss spam build scummy? PauseChamp
[2022-12-10 05:55:40] <!%Ebonslayer> @ferWHAAAAT That's unavoidable. Even DS2 has a meta, the important part I think is making the meta not too much stronger than other options.
[2022-12-10 05:55:57] <ferWHAAAAT> Death Stranding 2?
[2022-12-10 05:55:59] <+vezzevv> what are peoples thoughts on dual gs crouch attacks?

[2022-12-10 05:56:53] <Angusb123> The dual pickaxe build was cool
[2022-12-10 05:56:53] <%hokmon_> probably the host disconnecting
[2022-12-10 05:56:58] <%KungFuAndrew> I'm confused about the heals. It looks like sometimes they aren't tirggering?

[2022-12-10 05:57:14] <get_Ziggy_with_it> you only get a heal when you kill someone

[2022-12-10 05:57:27] <get_Ziggy_with_it> if you help but don't secure it, you get no flasks or heals
[2022-12-10 05:57:32] <+vezzevv> @kungfuandrew ive never used it either tbh, but playing against it I feel like it's in a good place now that wavedashing is gone
[2022-12-10 05:57:34] <blazedarca9> @ebonslayer thats fair. arena still seem like quick fun though
[2022-12-10 05:57:41] <+Arkantoscream> leading killer doesnt get healed
[2022-12-10 05:57:48] <+Arkantoscream> thats why

[2022-12-10 05:59:24] <NotHivetex> this seems fun
[2022-12-10 05:59:25] <!%Ebonslayer> @reload46 The only real nerf was probably the blanked WA damage reduction.

[2022-12-10 06:06:49] <FoxKnight32> FDS should just be removed at this point. it has had so many exploits LUL
[2022-12-10 06:06:50] <ThatsFugly> FDS has been bugged since 1.0. How have they not fixed it?
[2022-12-10 06:06:55] <%KungFuAndrew> He's cheating because he is using fire's deadly sin, combined with frost build up. It's a glitch.

[2022-12-10 06:07:20] <!Lyevi> @Ebonslayer It is for sure, but he can't get the benefit of frostbite because FDS resets the debuff timer, although maybe it's easier to build up?

[2022-12-10 06:17:59] <+bossmandwil> it says pvp damage increase 8% no?  So that is nt correct @rnblaze  thanks bro
[2022-12-10 06:17:59] <blazedarca9> its a cool exotic but also award being a floating target
[2022-12-10 06:18:12] <!%Ebonslayer> @AuroraUnit486 Gotcha, and I'm asking for accuracy, not really stability. How is it over ranges longer than 5 meters?
[2022-12-10 06:18:16] <blazedarca9> I wish it gave you an air dodge on charge or something

[2022-12-10 06:20:40] <blazedarca9> stat wise my God roll funnel gets outgunned by it. by the numbers I should out range it but I dont
[2022-12-10 06:20:44] <!%Ebonslayer> @AuroraUnit486 How exactly does Heat Rises not work with it? Does using the perk of the weapon deactivate HR?
[2022-12-10 06:21:02] <blazedarca9> so the exotic perform better than range says imo
[2022-12-10 06:21:09] <noxypoxyroodypoo> you got shadowbanned for being too good

[2022-12-10 06:21:31] <!%AuroraUnit486> @Ebonslayer from what i've seen people say, since i don't warlock much, heat rises literally does not turn on if you are currently using this exotic, so i imagine if you're currently floating with it you'll just fall
[2022-12-10 06:21:35] <marvOlous3> aimbot? walls?

[2022-12-10 06:32:30] <!%AuroraUnit486> @Ebonslayer oh yeah it has a new perk where projectile hits improve melee damage, and melee or projectile hits extend the duration of that

[2022-12-10 06:33:12] <x_BMC> weight ratio is a main reason he doesn't use many shields
[2022-12-10 06:33:15] <!%Ebonslayer> @AuroraUnit486 Ah, interesting. Too bad they removed Arcstrider synergy with Glaives in Arc 3.0, I would have liked that a few months ago.
[2022-12-10 06:33:21] <+TangyBlueBerry> your the one winning
[2022-12-10 06:33:30] <x_BMC> no room for it when min/maxing
[2022-12-10 06:33:41] <!%AuroraUnit486> it can also roll pugilist in the other column so that's good synergy
[2022-12-10 06:33:50] <Oobidoob> most shield builds in this are either heavy shield pokers (which is boring) or shields with utility like sentinel shield

[2022-12-10 06:35:20] <!%Ebonslayer> @AuroraUnit486 If you weren't aware, before Arc 3.0 Combat Flow, the Arcstrider passive that restored dodge on a melee kill, worked with Glaives. Since that's built into a melee ability now it doesn't work.
[2022-12-10 06:35:22] <+zekrond> Wtf Oroboro I was in your lobby just now thought you were a fake. Why didn’t you focus the mage

[2022-12-10 06:40:25] <!%Ebonslayer> @AuroraUnit486 I was hoping Arc 3.0 was gonna give them some synergy. It'd make sense since Arcstrider's "weapon" is a staff, a polearm just like Glaive. All they did was remove every bit of synergy the class had with the weapon type instead.

[2022-12-10 06:41:42] <!%Ebonslayer> @AuroraUnit486 Ironically the class with best synergy with Glaives is Warlock, the one class that doesn't have a melee focus anywhere in its kit.

[2022-12-10 06:46:15] <JELLOPHOBE> hows the arena been so far? havent had a chance to check it out myself
[2022-12-10 06:46:26] <%KungFuAndrew> @whitebat_ivi I'm super hyped for that. All I want is straight action, no QTE's, and I'll be happy

[2022-12-10 06:46:32] <!%AuroraUnit486> @Ebonslayer im guessing glaives don't proc it properly right
[2022-12-10 06:46:34] <%Wamoo57> everyone is poised to the gills in these arenas lol
[2022-12-10 06:46:36] <+zekrond> @oroboro is 66 str enough for a str build at 150
[2022-12-10 06:46:38] <!%Ebonslayer> @AuroraUnit486 Well, glaives will trigger Knockout on a killing blow, which is only supposed to happen when you get an enemy to critical health, 1 shots don't trigger it.
[2022-12-10 06:46:38] <Nomad_Kane> Are the regular R2's a lot stronger now?
[2022-12-10 06:46:40] <JELLOPHOBE> good or bad clusterfuck
[2022-12-10 06:46:45] <moffnat> Is there a password chat is using to pair up?
[2022-12-10 06:46:53] <!%Ebonslayer> @AuroraUnit486 But the damage bonus of Knockout also doesn't apply to Glaives.
[2022-12-10 06:47:01] <KelsoTabasco> Dang lmao
[2022-12-10 06:47:03] <mylifical> have you ever tried the pokémon arena?

[2022-12-10 06:47:31] <JELLOPHOBE> can you use flask in arena?
[2022-12-10 06:47:31] <!%AuroraUnit486> yeah but cragblade is cool
[2022-12-10 06:47:38] <%lolmato010> cragblade looks cooler so I'll go with that
[2022-12-10 06:47:48] <Jus1ice1> is it known the level range and weap upgrades for pvp?
[2022-12-10 06:47:58] <!%Ebonslayer> @AuroraUnit486 Neither does the new part of it in Arc 3.0 that used to be Reversal, where health regen kickstarts on a melee kill. Ironically, the Sentinel fragment that does exactly the same thing works fine.
[2022-12-10 06:47:59] <%KungFuAndrew> I modded Cragblade to work on whips, it looks hilarious

[2022-12-10 06:48:38] <+zekrond> Oh ok nice
[2022-12-10 06:48:46] <Nomad_Kane> Keep in mind that 99 isn't a breakpoint for anything.
[2022-12-10 06:48:50] <Gohd> @zekrond Yea but you gotta have the flast strength buff and 2 hand the weapon
[2022-12-10 06:48:53] <+LostInTheCosmicSea> The arena is fun AF when it works in the snap of a finger. Someone budget From.
[2022-12-10 06:49:01] <mylifical> is cragblade jus like a flat damage buff
[2022-12-10 06:49:04] <Gohd> Flask
[2022-12-10 06:49:08] <%lolmato010> for faith weapon infusion which is better holy or fire?
[2022-12-10 06:49:16] <%KungFuAndrew> @mylifical Adds some physical, and increases poise damage
[2022-12-10 06:49:17] <+zekrond> @gohd I do 2H but I don’t use the flash buff, is it a big difference?
[2022-12-10 06:49:25] <%shirou01> go fire honestly
[2022-12-10 06:49:27] <%+primal_xl> flash for strength is pointless if you are going to 2h at 66
[2022-12-10 06:49:28] <%Tech_EX> wait can you crag fists?
[2022-12-10 06:49:29] <!%Ebonslayer> @AuroraUnit486 I actually made a (incomplete) list of synergies some months ago on Reddit. If you want I can whisper you the link.
[2022-12-10 06:49:32] <TheRealWholehorse> @zekrond if you're 2 handing 54 is good enough since it puts you at 81
[2022-12-10 06:49:32] <Nomad_Kane> For 2handing str weapons you get the same scaling from 54 to 99 str. It's all 80+ scaling.
[2022-12-10 06:49:36] <%+primal_xl> flask*
[2022-12-10 06:49:37] <mylifical> @kungfuandrew ic ty

[2022-12-10 06:49:43] <+hermaeu> Don't you lose physical dmg with mimic head ?

[2022-12-10 06:49:55] <%A2345667> arena mode above 4 players i'd say is bound to be a mess
[2022-12-10 06:49:55] <!%Ebonslayer> @AuroraUnit486 Well, I say "synergies" but in reality it's mostly what I thought could have synergy but didn't.
[2022-12-10 06:50:01] <%batterdaddy32> cragblade is like hot sauce you can put that shit on anything
[2022-12-10 06:50:03] <!%AuroraUnit486> things that should have it

[2022-12-10 06:52:01] <Nomad_Kane> Them nerfing thrusting sword crouch pokes was actually a buff to colossals.

[2022-12-10 06:53:31] <%KungFuAndrew> @tiwtch_youtuber9 Occult is really great on weapons that have bleed normally
[2022-12-10 06:53:38] <Nomad_Kane> Oh neat... they buffed the raptor talons R2's. They're significantly faster.

[2022-12-10 06:54:01] <!%Ebonslayer> @tiwtch_youtuber9 Occult has better Arcane scaling, Blood will add a bunch of bleed buildup to the weapon.
[2022-12-10 06:54:03] <vGhastt> this is atrocious
[2022-12-10 06:54:03] <KoyFoster> Occult gives physical dmg off of arcane. And greatly increases arcane scaling.

[2022-12-10 06:56:57] <tiwtch_youtuber9> the use smart Style
[2022-12-10 06:56:57] <+zekrond> That guys lightning ain’t much better lmao
[2022-12-10 06:57:02] <%KungFuAndrew> If you bleed him, does the Iron Perfume prevent his stagger?
[2022-12-10 06:57:06] <+slamminsam28> whats that guys stat build
[2022-12-10 06:57:06] <%shirou01> when he spawns, everyone have to target him or
[2022-12-10 06:57:15] <akatosh_1318> Pretty good invasion build POG
[2022-12-10 06:57:16] <vGhastt> I think ranges from 125 to 150 tho. no one knows the exact arena levels tho. but that guys build definitely not 125 @devinguy
[2022-12-10 06:57:16] <mylifical> is endure what's making him so tanky?
[2022-12-10 06:57:24] <%+Skwizgarr> not even a good player, just cheesing
[2022-12-10 06:57:30] <!%Ebonslayer> @mylifical He's using Ironjar Aromatic.
[2022-12-10 06:57:31] <%KungFuAndrew> @mylifical It's a perfume that grants Iron Flesh
[2022-12-10 06:57:33] <dustnoise> jesus fucking chirst this dragon fire breath guy
[2022-12-10 06:57:34] <Oobidoob> that's hilarious

[2022-12-10 06:57:42] <%+KeetsScrimalittle> 300
[2022-12-10 06:57:43] <tiwtch_youtuber9> probably 140
[2022-12-10 06:57:46] <loutnov> He’s a villain fr
[2022-12-10 06:57:47] <%shirou01> probably around 200 lol at the least
[2022-12-10 06:57:48] <waffleRox> 387
[2022-12-10 06:57:48] <+paipai314> he is not immune to grab right?
[2022-12-10 06:57:48] <DennisOkiba> he's fatrolling tho
[2022-12-10 06:57:53] <$JagersAC0G> prob around 200-300
[2022-12-10 06:57:59] <zxthed> jesus
[2022-12-10 06:58:00] <tiwtch_youtuber9> @shirou01 nope exist limits
[2022-12-10 06:58:01] <mylifical> how can you even match with this dude
[2022-12-10 06:58:02] <+Devinguy> @vGhastt i was playing at about 240 and people had basically the same kind of builds lmao
[2022-12-10 06:58:04] <!%$Mohl97> if there was ever a guy to deathblight, it's this dickhead
[2022-12-10 06:58:04] <+BombPop> HypeLUL
[2022-12-10 06:58:06] <+Bl4z31n> based
[2022-12-10 06:58:06] <+zekrond> So I wonder how and when they can nerf that dragon breath man
[2022-12-10 06:58:07] <%+Skwizgarr> judging by him fatrolling, he has 0 endurance and every point in damage and health
[2022-12-10 06:58:09] <%shirou01> @tiwtch_youtuber9 LUL well fuck
[2022-12-10 06:58:09] <iFailedEnglish> Fair. and. balanced
[2022-12-10 06:58:12] <+itsKWRU> arena levels aren't normalized? bs LUL
[2022-12-10 06:58:12] <Nomad_Kane> At least he's getting fucked up by lightning bro.
[2022-12-10 06:58:13] <chicasloco11433> And people complain about moonveil lol
[2022-12-10 06:58:14] <Or0ku_Saki> theres rankings for combatants? gold etc
[2022-12-10 06:58:20] <x_BMC> he's fatrolling though, build balanced. kekw
[2022-12-10 06:58:28] <!%Ebonslayer> @Or0ku_Saki Yeah, but they mean basically nothing.
[2022-12-10 06:58:29] <Picuira> balanced
[2022-12-10 06:58:29] <%KungFuAndrew> @Skwizgarr He's fat rolling as a side effect from the aromatic
[2022-12-10 06:58:33] VIEWERS: 1 549
[2022-12-10 06:58:37] <+zekrond> This guy makes the wave of gold and cannon spammers look reasonable hahahaha
[2022-12-10 06:58:40] <%+Skwizgarr> even without it he was fat rolling
[2022-12-10 06:58:44] <%hokmon_> at least the bullgoat didn't win
[2022-12-10 06:58:46] <mylifical> LUL LUL ain't no way he's the same level as everyone else
[2022-12-10 06:58:47] <GloriousDutch> At least FromSoft is collecting all this shitter data
[2022-12-10 06:58:49] <the_vermin_kingx> are these password fights?
[2022-12-10 06:58:49] <!%AuroraUnit486> he didnt even win LMAO

[2022-12-10 06:58:51] <%shirou01> that;s fucked
[2022-12-10 06:58:55] <medmig> what did i just witness
[2022-12-10 06:58:55] <+paipai314> is there any cheap grab in the game?
[2022-12-10 06:59:00] <+RennellJr> That was hilarious
[2022-12-10 06:59:00] <gosutosheruu> jfc that was chaos
[2022-12-10 06:59:01] <%KungFuAndrew> Okay, so can status proc stagger the Aromatic?
[2022-12-10 06:59:02] <%lolmato010> @oroboro GG originally got to play with you
[2022-12-10 06:59:03] <Bsaa_agent_tony> That was rough af lol
[2022-12-10 06:59:04] <%+rnblaze> @Oroboro that was one of the worst macthes i've been in
[2022-12-10 06:59:06] <marvOlous3> lolol
[2022-12-10 06:59:07] <vGhastt> actually if he's fat rolling then it probably is a 125 build and he's just sacrificing his endurance @devinguy LUL LUL
[2022-12-10 06:59:11] <iFailedEnglish> You could fill an ocean with the sweat
[2022-12-10 06:59:12] <Bathezid> going to go bleach my eyes now :)
[2022-12-10 06:59:13] <tiwtch_youtuber9> bro create a video about this build bro 😂😂😂😂
[2022-12-10 06:59:16] <!%$Mohl97> @paipai314 the only grab that isn't a backstab or the likes is inescapable frenzy afaik
[2022-12-10 06:59:21] <Nomad_Kane> Try barbaric roar so you can just poise it and get a bleed proc?
[2022-12-10 06:59:28] <!%AuroraUnit486> @lolmato010 please tell me you weren't the bullgoat
[2022-12-10 06:59:28] <%lolmato010> @oroboro I was the dude with the katana then vyke's
[2022-12-10 06:59:28] <tiwtch_youtuber9> I think is good content for u
[2022-12-10 06:59:29] <%+ChaseTheBroYT> was he using ironjar aromatic and dragon breath LUL
[2022-12-10 06:59:31] <1021022> ive heard that the 1 handed fist heavy is really fast
[2022-12-10 06:59:31] <+paipai314> ye true
[2022-12-10 06:59:38] <%KungFuAndrew> The only counter to that build is to exploit FDS
[2022-12-10 06:59:47] <%+rnblaze> @lolmato010 i was the guy with morgotts
[2022-12-10 06:59:48] <%+ChaseTheBroYT> lol thats a fun time
[2022-12-10 06:59:50] <Seylamander> Yeah you can do that at 125
[2022-12-10 06:59:52] <%+Skwizgarr> you need a pure caster to blast him out of dragon breath
[2022-12-10 06:59:57] <Bluestin> I kinda wish more people would bust out Godrick's axe in arena
[2022-12-10 07:00:00] <%+rnblaze> @lolmato010 that shit w cancer
[2022-12-10 07:00:01] <+zekrond> @oroboro is there a best str weapons list for pvp or nah
[2022-12-10 07:00:02] <tiwtch_youtuber9> Is some Builds people create Original Builds and is super cool
[2022-12-10 07:00:03] <%+primal_xl> using the perfume in full bullgoats and dragon spamming...completely balanced
[2022-12-10 07:00:06] <%lolmato010> that bullgoats and dragon lighting my god
[2022-12-10 07:00:08] <Bsaa_agent_tony> Back him up chase
[2022-12-10 07:00:08] <%Shmanglebby> I was not aware arena was introduced. Fucking sick
[2022-12-10 07:00:23] <%+ChaseTheBroYT> im slowly making a ps5 build, or i totally would
[2022-12-10 07:00:31] <%lolmato010> @rnblaze glad we kinda ganked them

[2022-12-10 07:00:36] <!%Ebonslayer> @AuroraUnit486 Best Glaive build I've tried since Arc 3.0 is just a Voidwalker I think with the exotic Glaive and Karnstein Armlets.
[2022-12-10 07:00:44] <Oobidoob> wish this game had crossplay, perfect game for it
[2022-12-10 07:00:44] <vGhastt> @chasethebroyt WeirdChamp
[2022-12-10 07:00:47] <%+rnblaze> every other match has been like that for me
[2022-12-10 07:00:47] <tiwtch_youtuber9> I think this guy is Fat Rowling but use Fast Ash of war to move fast
[2022-12-10 07:00:56] <%+Setis_Dagre> @ChaseTheBroYT I look forward to getting my ass handed to me by you on PS5
[2022-12-10 07:00:59] <Bsaa_agent_tony> Yoo that would be sick
[2022-12-10 07:01:06] <%batterdaddy32> @zekrond night rider glaive is a must have for str. it has an S scaling at +25 heavy
[2022-12-10 07:01:10] <1021022> kinda bugs me that alot of weapons which are the best in their class are best regardless of str or dex build
[2022-12-10 07:01:13] <%+ChaseTheBroYT> yeah being on ps5 will definitely be a fun time
[2022-12-10 07:01:18] <hpmv19> witch platform?
[2022-12-10 07:01:20] <Nomad_Kane> Giant hunt or lions roar counters that kind of thing pretty easily.
[2022-12-10 07:01:21] <iFailedEnglish> At least when you run builds like that you get everyone on your ass, but even so it was doing ridiculously good against everyone
[2022-12-10 07:01:22] <+zekrond> @batterdaddy32 niiiiice ty
[2022-12-10 07:01:26] <FaZe_AlecBaldwin> how does matchmaking work is it just sl+wep lvl?
[2022-12-10 07:01:29] <%Shmanglebby> Elden Ring definitely should have crossplay I agree. The longevity would be insane too
[2022-12-10 07:01:34] <Bsaa_agent_tony> Cant wait to see you there!

[2022-12-10 07:04:06] <Docta_Pingu> is this build a reference to your first Dark Souls 2 fist build?

[2022-12-10 07:04:40] <%Shmanglebby> How’s everyone feeling about the current balance of the game? I been out of the loop since the first balance update
[2022-12-10 07:04:42] <Nomad_Kane> Everyone's fucking that guy up now after the breath.

[2022-12-10 07:09:30] <val_draconis> i just lost about 11 days worth of progress thru ng+7 so im slowly working my way back thru it all
[2022-12-10 07:09:40] <vGhastt> 1v1 and 2v2s are pretty much more active

[2022-12-10 07:10:29] <JhofSwag> 2v2s and 4s or duels are way better imo
[2022-12-10 07:10:36] <%Shmanglebby> I’m surprised the 1v1s have that level of volume. Time to kill is very quick so it seems pointless to 1v1

[2022-12-10 07:39:13] <!%$Mohl97> you may lose out on a talisman slot, but you turn your mimic into a more effective decoy since he shouldn't be looking like a spirit summon
[2022-12-10 07:39:13] <Calpernius> 200+ is fun
[2022-12-10 07:39:14] <Nomad_Kane> 200 is like this except everyone has more incantations I think.
[2022-12-10 07:39:14] <BaronVonThule> Danke
[2022-12-10 07:39:14] <dandersonwithcheese> what weapon upgrade level do you use at rl90?
[2022-12-10 07:39:15] <Bluestin> 150 is popping off like mad on PC
[2022-12-10 07:39:21] <GeneraIRadhan> 1 vs 1 me bro. I would smoke the sht out of you
[2022-12-10 07:39:25] <%batterdaddy32> @Rysir 90 is a pretty complete build. I invade in that range all the time.

[2022-12-10 07:39:27] <+satori_hanzo_san> 200 is great, I have a 200 and a 90 character, both are good

[2022-12-10 07:40:58] <%batterdaddy32> the compass doesn't work for invasions or co-op right now
[2022-12-10 07:41:02] <%xAgrezion> @GeneraIRadhan this guy is funny
[2022-12-10 07:41:03] <daddydemonic> Fromsoftware took away invasion to promote the arena chat
[2022-12-10 07:41:09] <GeneraIRadhan> @thesortinghelmet remove his D out of youe mouth fanboy
[2022-12-10 07:41:09] <!%$Mohl97> @GeneraIRadhan what was your build then?

[2022-12-10 07:41:16] <fyrsword> Yeah, Arena is tired already. I'm at the end of my session and the nerd builds are everywhere
[2022-12-10 07:41:23] <+HungryTaurus> no they didn't lol
[2022-12-10 07:41:31] <Nomad_Kane> You'd think it'd be pretty easy to get invasions with all the reds doing arena. No competition.
[2022-12-10 07:41:31] <$TheSortingHelmet> @Noob_Almost My guess he was a laggy wave of piss
[2022-12-10 07:41:45] <FoxKnight32> invasions gone forever FEelsBadMan

[2022-12-10 07:42:06] <GeneraIRadhan> @thesortinghelmet so if he dies its only because of lag. sure bud cope more im just better

[2022-12-10 07:43:11] <%batterdaddy32> the compass is bugged for co-op and invasions currently
[2022-12-10 07:43:14] <%batterdaddy32> it has to be fixed
[2022-12-10 07:43:17] <$umbasaFGC> @GeneraIRadhan why are you so mad at a helmet
[2022-12-10 07:43:26] <wander_falke> what would happen if there was a choice between melee and caster mode, wavespammers spamming waves at other wavers while beeing dragonroared and the melee having fun ?
[2022-12-10 07:43:26] <$TheSortingHelmet> @GeneraIRadhan Sounds like he dropped his pacifier in the toiler.

[2022-12-10 07:43:51] <%batterdaddy32> invasions are not gone. I did invasions today
[2022-12-10 07:43:54] <dogclergyman> @Oroboro is this a tribute to your DS2 punchy build?
[2022-12-10 07:43:56] <MSTRPRFKT> Everyone seems to be using miracles now
[2022-12-10 07:44:02] <Nomad_Kane> @wander_falke I don't think it would be interesting if there was a mode that disallowed spell slots.
[2022-12-10 07:44:03] <%+primal_xl> @generairadhan are you 12? it's not that deep bro
[2022-12-10 07:44:09] <+satori_hanzo_san> @Markytous yeah it only works on one weapon at a time anyway
[2022-12-10 07:44:09] <MSTRPRFKT> The dragon lightning got buffed or something?
[2022-12-10 07:44:11] <Harukosama11> It's not impossible to invade, I feel like they place you closer than they used to

[2022-12-10 23:54:02] <%+Setis_Dagre> Since I have 1 150, 5 125s, 2 90s, and 2 50s, thinking about moving my 150 up to 200 and one of the 125s up to 150, but it's hard to choose which one

[2022-12-10 23:54:45] <%+Setis_Dagre> @Illuna_Meira Honestly the tech is what gets my attention, when they have a really good, expressive model/rigging
[2022-12-10 23:55:43] <@%Pallydan9K> Uho uho uho
[2022-12-10 23:55:48] <%$Illuna_Meira> @setis_dagre I like the artwork, rigging nowadays is not that hard (in my opinion since I do too)

[2022-12-10 23:56:08] <%$Illuna_Meira> expressiveness improves with good camera and expression tracking
[2022-12-10 23:56:31] <%$Illuna_Meira> if you have a resting bitch face like me all the time your model won't be expressive despite how much you put into it..
[2022-12-10 23:56:35] <%$Illuna_Meira> Big sad
