[2023-01-10 12:11:51] <%tonykrow1> move right 2 marks, move left 5 marks, youll move right again but it will most likely be a full rotation
[2023-01-10 12:12:00] <%+Stephooon> so you turn it right twice and then from there you turn it left 5 times
[2023-01-10 12:12:00] <%savijin> it means 2 to the right then from where you stop go left 5 times
[2023-01-10 12:12:02] <%+imAaza> never used locker i went to school without a bag most of the time

[2023-01-10 13:45:15] <%kiyuree> peepoWow god I love the Fire Keeper so much. everytime I visit her and she says 'welcome home' i feel at rest. whenever i wanted to get stronger she would gladly and gently reach out her hand and lets me touch it without hesitation at all. when i leave she would always give me a sweet farewell message which encourages my poor and tired soul. she really is the Fire Keeper indeed, for she always warms my heart whenever I think of her. i would let her burn me to ashes as a form of my love to her.

[2023-01-10 13:55:34] <%kiyuree> DS1 is nice, DS2 though BASED
[2023-01-10 13:55:39] <%Swiftpain> 1 is worth playing
[2023-01-10 13:55:42] <%+imAaza> this mod is gonna be very cool when it comes out
[2023-01-10 13:55:42] <%Robo_Hood> 1 might be worth but 2... its okay
[2023-01-10 13:55:44] <%+AshenGlister> dark souls 1 and demon souls are worth it
[2023-01-10 13:55:46] <%Dragonmassag77> U gotta beat them all tho Aki
[2023-01-10 13:55:48] <%Dragonmassag77> :)
[2023-01-10 13:55:53] <%+AshenGlister> dark souls 2 aint worth it
[2023-01-10 13:55:58] <%vic_n1> play DS4 OK
[2023-01-10 13:56:04] <%Malithas4> I love DS2
[2023-01-10 13:56:16] <%+imAaza> This is a sekiro moveset boss
[2023-01-10 13:56:16] <@%MurderCrumpet> DS2 is a fav of mine but it’s legit super different much slower and more punishing in some ways much easier in a bunch of others

[2023-01-10 13:56:47] <%Robo_Hood> ds2 is worth it if you can't get enough soulsborne games but I'd play it last out of from soft's library

[2023-01-10 13:57:15] <%+imAaza> So this mod is basically a bunch of other dark souls packed into one mod
[2023-01-10 13:57:22] <@%MurderCrumpet> DS1 is super nostalgic but very clunky, it’s def got this special feeling though

[2023-01-10 13:58:05] <%kiyuree> Its far from soulsborne imho
[2023-01-10 13:58:14] <+Ramza_> sekiro was game of the year for a reason :)
[2023-01-10 13:58:16] <%Dragonmassag77> buy it play and if u don't return it before 2 hours ez nagBrain

[2023-01-10 13:58:25] <@%MurderCrumpet> I didn’t like sekiro cuz of story + environment I thought it was too different
[2023-01-10 13:58:28] <!%Andre_R91> Thats 6
[2023-01-10 13:58:36] <%+imAaza> THAT'S 6 AKI BadCowsin

[2023-01-10 13:59:48] <@%MurderCrumpet> Sekiro has crazy fun and fast combat when u get good but it’s kinda annoying until that point

[2023-01-10 15:32:45] <%Mizuirazu> the other thing that deterred me was the anxiety every time I booted it up though lmao

[2023-01-10 16:00:44] <%AbineVRC> a boss having more hp doesnt make them harder, while on paper Morgott is harder than Margit, Margit is much earlier in the game so you have less options to fight him @dcccxliilegion
[2023-01-10 16:00:52] <%dcccxliilegion> @abinevrc I died less then 30 times to Margit and a bit less then Morgot
