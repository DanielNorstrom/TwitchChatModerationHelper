[2023-01-07 02:24:51] <%saturn_ring> @Alfonso_Khan Will see - I have faith it will be at least decent but really hoping there are things that make it stand out as a sequel than DLC. Also, hoping performance isn't too bad lol. I am guessing still some pop-in and such but hopefully a little better than BOTW at least

[2023-01-07 04:31:21] <%potapeno> it doesnt work in a sandwich bc they arent flat
[2023-01-07 04:31:21] <%+robbyplease> yeah in a sandwich that is a bit weird. slices please

[2023-01-07 04:31:26] <%+IchiMango> another bad take huh barb
[2023-01-07 04:31:26] <roedtogsvart> they are only good on a sandwich sliced like japapenos
[2023-01-07 04:31:28] <%RIFFOSAURUS> just slice em real thin and dont use too much since theyre very sweet
[2023-01-07 04:31:30] <+HandofRag> yeah cut in half
[2023-01-07 04:31:31] <%Almar_AZL9S> barbShrug
[2023-01-07 04:31:32] <%Patty> cherry tomatoes would overpower the sandwich as well as add a lot more skin changing the sandwich texture
[2023-01-07 04:31:33] <%luigi_sama7> they taste better with cured meat sandwiches
[2023-01-07 04:31:35] <%Patty> I feel ya
[2023-01-07 04:31:43] <%cloudhppr> know what you do with cherry tomatoes - throw them on some foil with some olive oil, garlic, salt pepper, cook them in the oven til the skin wilts a bit. then put them on the sando

[2023-01-07 20:43:44] <%JOHUshy> just assume Nintendo will be assholes
[2023-01-07 20:43:46] <%+KoltonMcCombo> smash community, gross
[2023-01-07 20:43:48] <%$jimbobsandwich> smash players are forever stunted and it's honestly a BIG shame on Nintendo
[2023-01-07 20:43:50] <%HCPnator> Nintendo sees their game and money around it and they're not getting any...ALERT ALERT!
[2023-01-07 20:43:54] <%$mprziv> @fruitmuffins Nah, you are. SMW romhacks are built on SMW. Just like Super Metroid hacks are built on SM.
[2023-01-07 20:43:58] <+Cobrahh> attention is bad from nintendo pretty much always
[2023-01-07 20:43:58] <%Diegazbro> its so wierd how nintendo just hates the smash community so much

[2023-01-07 20:44:05] <%Drunxgg> what happened with smash bros?
[2023-01-07 20:44:06] <%$dotBik> @conanthevegetarian They usually schedule them for off-hours
[2023-01-07 20:44:06] <%+Trance8> Nintendo is like the Eye of Sauron. Always watching, always witing
[2023-01-07 20:44:12] <%Qu_Marsh> can't just keep running the vanilla games over and over ever year
[2023-01-07 20:44:14] <hallow1880> I enjoy the Runners talking about the strats.... thats a real strength of GDQ IMO
[2023-01-07 20:44:15] <+Mase_Face_> people were using the Slippy method to play online with each other and they didn't like it and stopped the tournament
[2023-01-07 20:44:17] <%ToaSTy_T0aST> the whole smash community is just a weird community in general
[2023-01-07 20:44:18] <+Phadafi> Nintendo sucks in this matter
[2023-01-07 20:44:19] <%+FruitMuffins> @mprziv I think you replied to the wrong person :)
[2023-01-07 20:44:21] <%$dotBik> The ultra-long speedruns are what they put in when there aren't any other short runs to slot
[2023-01-07 20:44:23] <%BeatnautLives> what did they do to smash bros this time?!@??!
[2023-01-07 20:44:23] <%Rocky210420> Nintendo always protecting their IP'S
[2023-01-07 20:44:25] <%$ACIDRIOTT> what happened with smash bros?

[2023-01-07 20:44:34] <%mdz4040> I'd say mario maker opened up the interest to rom hacks
[2023-01-07 20:44:34] <%$PatKilo> Wasn‚Äôt the issue with the smash brothers thing was because the competition site hosted the actual rom instead of a patch to it?

[2023-01-07 20:44:41] <%mort459> wasnt that the first one? Original kaizo had a mythical quality to it
[2023-01-07 20:44:47] <%+jamescid> they realized miyamoto is busy hunting  barb
[2023-01-07 20:44:48] <%$dotBik> It's been running for like a decade, makes sense that criteria and what's popular changes.

[2023-01-07 20:44:57] <%$freya_thuriaaz> it might be because its for charity, essentially a nonprofit

[2023-01-07 20:45:02] <%+bazinga219124> so many decisions by nintendo are just weird and it gets worse.
[2023-01-07 20:45:04] <big_feez> It might be cause of the consistency of runners too. Kaizo players are so much better now. In the early days runs might have been risky
[2023-01-07 20:45:05] <%+WilyBomby> and then barb says it immediatly in interviews barbToxic

[2023-01-07 21:21:47] <%drkirienko> its not necessarily that those are the only levels. is just that its hard to find things that AREN'T that. they're out there. just hard to find

[2023-01-07 21:22:46] <%drkirienko> no, the #1 problem with Mario Maker is people's aversion to skipping. If you just skip levels you don't like, it becomes a tremendously better game
[2023-01-07 21:22:48] <%FreshPrinceOfRockBand> idk if it has a scene tho

[2023-01-07 21:40:37] <%+heputyf> Shoulder is also bad
[2023-01-07 21:40:39] <%+waffle_irony> lots of nerves going through a small space

[2023-01-07 21:40:44] <%Diegazbro> yeah once something happen to a knee its never going to be the same and will always be more sensitive.

[2023-01-07 21:40:46] <%$Windyfionn> I would think spine or neck are worse
[2023-01-07 21:40:47] <%$ChickenLobotomy> Ankle too
[2023-01-07 21:40:48] <%Skr3wball> knee surgery is a bitch
[2023-01-07 21:40:49] <hereholdthis> penis injuries are bad

[2023-01-07 21:40:50] <%+dogfoodomelette> shoulder is horrible.
[2023-01-07 21:40:50] <%+FruitMuffins> probably any large joint
[2023-01-07 21:40:52] <%SirRetro91> @BarbarousKing i broke and dislocated my Elbow... got fucked up for 2 years with PT
[2023-01-07 21:40:54] <mmmmsugar> It‚Äôs hard to say because there are different types of pain‚Ä¶..for example, I had sciatic nerve pain that left me in 24/7  nerve pain for weeks. That was a completely different than when I had a level 2 ankle sprain or broke my collarbone
[2023-01-07 21:40:56] <%$freya_thuriaaz> lots of nerves and your boidy kinda needs those joints to move your legs and arms
[2023-01-07 21:40:56] <teamLNCHBX> back and shoulder are really bad, most chronic back pain never goes away
[2023-01-07 21:40:57] <%+zokered> Any hinge joint
[2023-01-07 21:41:01] <$ChappyGilmorre> @lazymashi ive had discectomy. relived tons of pain
