[2023-01-03 23:37:14] <thegamerboi1223> hi
[2023-01-03 23:37:22] <!%Runato> Hallo
[2023-01-03 23:37:38] <thegamerboi1223> @Runato hru?
[2023-01-03 23:37:44] <!%Runato> ok and you?
[2023-01-03 23:37:48] VIEWERS: 207
[2023-01-03 23:38:00] <@%pilllowofbees> which show was worth it, was it the one where they go to different priced restaurants?
[2023-01-03 23:38:01] <thegamerboi1223> good
[2023-01-03 23:38:29] <!%Runato> They go to different restaurants based on the price points of a specific dish
[2023-01-03 23:38:37] <!%Runato> Like $1 Ice Cream vs $1K
[2023-01-03 23:38:59] <@%pilllowofbees> ye that one okay
[2023-01-03 23:39:03] <!%Runato> It was like one of those few shows that people were like "Yeah this is the only thing of worth Buzzfeed has" LUL
[2023-01-03 23:39:38] <@%pilllowofbees> i always remember the high priced ones always had gold leaf

[2023-01-03 23:39:51] <!%Runato> Not always but it was generally gold leaf, truffles, or caviar
[2023-01-03 23:40:14] <!%Runato> Eventually it evidently became too tired that they looked for other expensive things instead
[2023-01-03 23:40:50] <@%pilllowofbees> KEKW i mean id get tired of shitting gold too eventually
[2023-01-03 23:41:03] <!%Runato> I still remember that Donut episode

[2023-01-03 23:43:49] VIEWERS: 202
[2023-01-03 23:43:54] <@%pilllowofbees> glove grind is the real struggle but at least you only need it once
[2023-01-03 23:44:21] <!%Runato> The equipment grind and needing Cons for Limiteds is really my biggest issue with the game so far and why I'm so down on it nowadays cause it helped burn me out
[2023-01-03 23:44:28] <@^StreamElements> Come check out my new YT video at https://www.youtube.com/c/MaiRubeeVT
[2023-01-03 23:44:41] <@%pilllowofbees> ye i get that
[2023-01-03 23:44:41] <!%Runato> And ofc, since I took a couple of weeks off for hiatus I'm severely behind
[2023-01-03 23:44:55] <!%Runato> Genshin is way more generous in that regard imo
[2023-01-03 23:45:25] <@%pilllowofbees> i will say tho is that most the new limiteds coming out wont require cons to be good
[2023-01-03 23:45:50] VIEWERS: 215
[2023-01-03 23:45:50] <!%Runato> Which ones specifically? I'm wondering if I should go for Lyra cause I want her or Tian cause Volt breaker (but not waifu)
[2023-01-03 23:46:11] <@%pilllowofbees> idk about genshin being generous lol i still lack basic characters for most comps after 2 years
[2023-01-03 23:46:29] <!%Runato> But you don't necessarily "need" them to be multi con'd
[2023-01-03 23:46:36] <!%Runato> The closest is Faruzan
[2023-01-03 23:46:47] <@%pilllowofbees> both lyra and tian are strong at base and better at a1
[2023-01-03 23:47:23] <!%Runato> It's hilarious there how multiple or even 1 4* is harder to get than the 5*, like I never got a single Faruzan
[2023-01-03 23:47:31] <@%pilllowofbees> KEKL i have c0 sucrose and benny i kind of need those
[2023-01-03 23:47:50] <@%pilllowofbees> tell me about it
[2023-01-03 23:47:54] VIEWERS: 215
[2023-01-03 23:47:57] <!%Runato> I feel like you almost have no excuse when it comes to Benny for even C1 since he's in the monthly shop
[2023-01-03 23:48:12] <@%pilllowofbees> i just got rosaria this banner after going for her like every rerun
[2023-01-03 23:48:26] <!%Runato> But yeah I feel like my point still stands
[2023-01-03 23:48:35] <!%Runato> about A/C's
[2023-01-03 23:48:45] <!%master_quadrillion> ye benny is the shop every 6 months but u do need the star gitter
[2023-01-03 23:49:19] <!%Runato> Yee. But I feel like the starglitter is easy enough especially if you keep rolling dupes past C6 like I did lol, that's 5 starglitter each time
[2023-01-03 23:49:37] <@%pilllowofbees> star glitter is scarce bc i need to save for characters i actually want and there are no weapons with crit stats
[2023-01-03 23:49:54] VIEWERS: 207
[2023-01-03 23:49:57] <!%master_quadrillion> ye it can be hard as a f2p to save em
[2023-01-03 23:51:13] <@%pilllowofbees> gotta go months without pulling just for 1 character a lot of the time
[2023-01-03 23:51:28] <@^StreamElements> Howdy do~ This worm is Pepega and will miss a few messages in chat rubee5Head If I missed your message, greetings, or goodnights, please post it again <3 Thank you for your time! rubeeH rubeeChoco
[2023-01-03 23:51:33] <!%Runato> I'm F2P on ToF and a...not even a dolphin but below that for Genshin, but I agree with Mai's thoughts that ToF tries to get you to pay more often
[2023-01-03 23:51:56] VIEWERS: 207
[2023-01-03 23:52:21] <@%pilllowofbees> it really does but at least you dont need to when it comes to progressing

[2023-01-03 23:52:54] <!%Runato> I dunno, I feel like with the hiatus I took plus being a week behind that there's just so much missed that I'm just way too far behind to catch up even at lvl 80
[2023-01-03 23:53:15] <!%Runato> I don't have a Visor or Reactor and I just recently mapped out the Confounding Abyss so RIP

[2023-01-03 23:54:16] <!%master_quadrillion> I'm behind on matrcies but I haven't been playing that regular tbf
[2023-01-03 23:55:03] <!%Runato> I guess that's like my main blessing that besides Cobalt/Saki/Tian/Lyra that I have the other chars, and the matrices are...ok tier
[2023-01-03 23:55:29] <@%pilllowofbees> tbh visor and reactor are too hard to get to worry about, they are just extra stats base gear is more important

[2023-01-03 23:56:29] <@%pilllowofbees> like you have to get lucky lucky for those to be good
[2023-01-03 23:56:46] <!%master_quadrillion> still need good crit gloves, current 1s have 2400 crit  rubeeDeadge
[2023-01-03 23:57:31] <@%pilllowofbees> mine are 2800 im pretty fine with that
[2023-01-03 23:57:39] <!%Runato> 3.1K for gloves, 1.8K for Boots, which is about 49.66% chance atm
[2023-01-03 23:57:59] VIEWERS: 195
[2023-01-03 23:58:14] <!%Runato> 9.2K Crit total, 520K HP....about 9.4K Volt/Altered
[2023-01-03 23:58:21] <@%pilllowofbees> thats pretty good
[2023-01-03 23:58:30] <!%Runato> It certainly doesn't feel like it lol
[2023-01-03 23:59:18] <@%pilllowofbees> i mean tof isnt genshin, you attack a lot more so 50% isnt as bad as it is there
[2023-01-03 23:59:41] <@%pilllowofbees> 50% is like the base line you wanna reach for f2p
[2023-01-03 23:59:41] <!%Runato> It's also significantly easier to get crit in Genshin especially if you're Cryo
