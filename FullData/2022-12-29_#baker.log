[2022-12-29 00:14:37] <Laydln> you dont need to build 4 orbs for stagger and TE + BF do more stagger than LTS

[2022-12-29 17:41:04] <%+GHOSTEDonline> Roxx admitted to false positive bans, it can definitely happen. But if I mail a friend 200k gold they can see where that 200k came from right?
[2022-12-29 17:41:45] <%polig> how much for 10k?
[2022-12-29 17:42:11] <%polig> im thinking to buy 100k, do you lower the price for higher amounts?

[2022-12-29 17:47:25] <freedomer07> I just noticed, that Lost Ark is too active, could explain in a couple words, why? :D

[2022-12-29 17:49:23] <%polig> dont see large gatherings
[2022-12-29 17:49:28] <%polig> many bots*
[2022-12-29 17:49:40] <freedomer07> Oh, I just don't know what to download btw, played Path of Exile, looks somehow similar
[2022-12-29 17:49:49] <@%+strengthie> I think this game could be in a really good spot if they merged EUW into EUC and NAW and NAE into just NA.
[2022-12-29 17:50:26] <freedomer07> Something like that, mate, yes :D
[2022-12-29 17:50:39] <AncientCapitals> Why is everyone focusing on bots in this game?
[2022-12-29 17:50:39] <@%^Streamlabs> because it's the best.
[2022-12-29 17:50:42] <freedomer07> Want to play with chill sometimes

[2022-12-29 17:51:24] <%polig> @AncientCapitals my man, bots are stealing from AGS, not players prob agree :)
[2022-12-29 17:51:33] <@%+strengthie> @AncientCapitals because it's a game where you can purchase power with gold which is what bots farm.

[2022-12-29 17:52:56] <%polig> i mean we had biggest raid in LA launched and its holiday season, should be surprising that brings more players
[2022-12-29 17:53:42] <%polig> i was lvling alt acc dont see many tbh
[2022-12-29 17:53:54] <%polig> there is some walking around but not a lot
[2022-12-29 17:54:19] <%polig> i really think that player base is fairly evenly divided by timezones yes
[2022-12-29 17:54:42] <%polig> and LA is very good game to minimize and leave it on
[2022-12-29 17:54:51] VIEWERS: 556
[2022-12-29 17:54:53] <freedomer07> so, the game isn't the best for f2p player?
[2022-12-29 17:55:00] <AncientCapitals> @strengthie you mean like every MMO out there these days?
[2022-12-29 17:55:18] <%polig> if you are willing to grind a lot you will be fine
[2022-12-29 17:55:35] <%polig> if you think to play 10h a week as f2p you prob wont have much fun
[2022-12-29 17:56:02] <freedomer07> Sure! Take your time!

[2022-12-29 17:58:06] <%naujokas3> hello baker ! i got legendary chaos gate map good day :D
[2022-12-29 17:58:07] <AncientCapitals> @strengthie its on the exact same level as wow or any other mmo
[2022-12-29 17:58:21] <@%+strengthie> @AncientCapitals That's absolutely not true.
[2022-12-29 17:58:43] <%polig> hold on now you get easy valtan groups? or casually playing get a good community ? neither of those are happening with casual time
[2022-12-29 17:58:52] VIEWERS: 556
[2022-12-29 17:58:54] <freedomer07> I played Conqueror's Blade for a while, but that game requires a lot of time to invest at least for a little improvements :D
[2022-12-29 17:59:10] <%polig> good community groups*
[2022-12-29 17:59:28] <AncientCapitals> i used to boost or "bus" in wow and i can tell you the amount of gold that was involved in that is insane
[2022-12-29 17:59:35] <@%+strengthie> Klone was a good example playing 10 ish hours per week
[2022-12-29 17:59:42] <%naujokas3> you maybe doing learning vykas or just the ones that know?

[2022-12-29 18:00:45] <@%+strengthie> @AncientCapitals Good for you, the main point is that gear caps out and that gold doesn't let you upgrade gear infinitely.
[2022-12-29 18:00:52] VIEWERS: 556
[2022-12-29 18:01:38] <%polig> im getting 2nd acc with pala, maybe i can check in a month or so
[2022-12-29 18:01:41] <llogicll> I got lvl 80 roster and im getting shit talked everytime :D  you think I got time for 13 other alt
[2022-12-29 18:02:05] <AncientCapitals> @strengthie no not inde but gear is in that case not guaranteed either so ppl have to buy 15-20 boosts to get that one item so i would say its atleast as prevalent
[2022-12-29 18:02:23] <SylvieEllis> you dont have to play everyday with 13 alts
[2022-12-29 18:02:26] <%polig> he prob waits 1h looking for group
[2022-12-29 18:02:27] <SylvieEllis> you have rested

[2022-12-29 18:03:46] <@%+strengthie> @AncientCapitals Yeah that's what I mean, and at the end of the tier it's basically a soft reset for the people getting boosted.
[2022-12-29 18:03:52] <llogicll> Usually w8 for 10-20 min max, roster doesnt means you are a pro, I got 1 main, started 2 alts atm
[2022-12-29 18:04:01] <%polig> my deadeyes sometimes gets gatekept by idiots, believe me low roosters has it rough if they dont find community or guild for new ppl xD

[2022-12-29 18:04:34] <%Grizzlybooey> I get rejected from parties every week but i dont see this as gatekeeping, its about just getting picked
[2022-12-29 18:04:37] <@%+strengthie> If your roster is shit then just get Demon's Roar
[2022-12-29 18:04:43] <@%+strengthie> problem solved
[2022-12-29 18:04:46] <%polig> yeah they will but waiting 30mins in party find every week aint fun xD

[2022-12-29 18:06:34] <@%+strengthie> Every MMO I've ever played getting a group as a dps is alway more painful than as a support

[2022-12-29 18:07:20] <llogicll> and you got 209 roster Baker
[2022-12-29 18:07:51] <irrationale2> easy to say while being 200 roster :)
[2022-12-29 18:08:13] <llogicll> Basically he got no chance to show the example
[2022-12-29 18:08:17] <@%+strengthie> Like I said above
[2022-12-29 18:08:18] <llogicll> bcs of the roster
[2022-12-29 18:08:42] <%polig> if you get acc with completely trash engr with that rooster that proves you got accepted because of rooster
[2022-12-29 18:08:43] <@%+strengthie> If you're actually good at the game, and your roster is low go get a Valtan Hell title
[2022-12-29 18:08:48] <%polig> 4x3 is not trash xD

[2022-12-29 19:38:48] <%+sarazein81> does it make a difference which class does which gate
[2022-12-29 19:38:54] <+pong670> it helps
[2022-12-29 19:39:03] <+pong670> but would say depends on player
[2022-12-29 19:39:11] <+pong670> if robot played and its perfect yes class matters

[2022-12-29 21:11:08] <%AncientCapitals> if you wanna brel you have to xP i usually go 4x3 + 1 or 2 might 5x3 if the engravings are decently priced

[2022-12-29 21:12:15] <%+sunnyice> I'm coming back after a long break stopped around argos I don't know if should go 4x3 now or save up for 5x3
[2022-12-29 21:12:42] <%AncientCapitals> i would go 4x3 to get invited to valtan / vykar NM its such a low cost
[2022-12-29 21:13:06] <%Kristolicious> I got the tip to go 5x3, or if 4x3, dont waste pheons on it, whatever that means
[2022-12-29 21:13:17] <+Ras______> LUL
[2022-12-29 21:13:21] <+Ras______> he didn't know
[2022-12-29 21:13:21] <Ushpia> :tf:
[2022-12-29 21:13:26] <%+sunnyice> @ancientcapitals then I would have to sound pheins again
[2022-12-29 21:13:34] <%+sunnyice> spend*
[2022-12-29 21:13:54] <%+Caedes55> so each legendary accessory purchase is 15 pheons, you need relic accessories to go 5x3 which are 25 pheons ea. if you have the gold upfront, in the long run its beneficial to go 5x3 if you can afford it
[2022-12-29 21:13:58] VIEWERS: 602
[2022-12-29 21:14:04] <%AncientCapitals> @sunnyice yep all depends on how much gold you got cause 5x3 is gonna cost you prob 3-4 times the cash and also cost you more peons cause you need a better stone
[2022-12-29 21:14:13] <%polig> i dont think pugs do wei
[2022-12-29 21:14:39] <%polig> i mean they can just ppl used to just ts

[2022-12-29 21:15:17] <Binkz> I tried
[2022-12-29 21:15:29] <%Kristolicious> @sunnyice yes at the bare minimum
[2022-12-29 21:15:39] <%+Niki_xyOn> pugs ts medusa too
[2022-12-29 21:15:42] <%+Niki_xyOn> just easier
[2022-12-29 21:15:43] <%Kristolicious> Then you need 1 12 engraving book
[2022-12-29 21:15:48] <%+Caedes55> @sunnyice 7-7 if you are going purple class books. 6-7 if you have legendary books
[2022-12-29 21:15:52] <+Ras______> with one +12 book you need 7/7 stone, if you have 2 +12 books you dont

[2022-12-29 22:46:57] <%+Niki_xyOn> took me 2 hours to get into 1-2 group with my 1510 main for example
[2022-12-29 22:47:45] <%+Niki_xyOn> i would have gone sleep and cry ^^
[2022-12-29 22:47:49] <%+Niki_xyOn> i think

[2022-12-29 22:48:48] <%+Niki_xyOn> it doesnt exclude each other
[2022-12-29 22:49:27] <%AncientCapitals> i have like 80 roster level and get accepted into groups, but then i dont apply to the deathless juicer group
[2022-12-29 22:49:36] <%+Niki_xyOn> ye i get the point ofc

[2022-12-29 22:52:34] <%+Niki_xyOn> sometimes i think about switching my main with barde, so i can do new content better, getting into groups etc.
[2022-12-29 22:52:54] <%Nikodermos> glad i preview the leaf skin, it removes the facial hair on my striker
[2022-12-29 22:53:30] <%AncientCapitals> man south vern storyline for the 10th time xP this is painful

[2022-12-29 22:54:24] <%+sarazein81> I dunno what to suggest, its hard with just a a handful of us around trying to hold 3 together

[2022-12-29 22:54:58] <%+Niki_xyOn> nah i got ditched with this tactic like a hundred times now, it doesnt work normally
[2022-12-29 22:55:10] <%+sarazein81> wasnt sure if we had new members or not as not checked
[2022-12-29 22:55:38] <%Kristolicious> I mean I just cleared vykas hard without a bus for the first time, not on my main, but on my alt pala, cuz my main just doesnt get let in, being 5x3 and full relic, doesnt happen
[2022-12-29 22:56:13] <%+Niki_xyOn> title i would suggest
[2022-12-29 22:56:16] <%+Niki_xyOn> like clown
[2022-12-29 22:56:26] VIEWERS: 574
[2022-12-29 22:56:48] <%Kristolicious> I mean I just did it on my alt, same scenario, why would I not be able to do it on my main
[2022-12-29 22:56:48] <@%^Streamlabs> because it's the best.
[2022-12-29 22:58:03] <%Kristolicious> I mean we talk about this all the time, so lets not drag it out, but I just wanna say, learning partys on vykas, is as rare as unicorns, and yes I did try to make my own

[2022-12-29 22:59:36] <%naujokas3> or what ever they called

[2022-12-29 23:00:54] <%naujokas3> imagine if people paying for like learning parties that be good
[2022-12-29 23:00:55] <%AncientCapitals> I dont know if ppl are not used to playing mmos or something but coming from playing high mythic plus and mythic raiding in WOW gatekeeping is as harsh or harsher cause you have addons tracking how "good" the person is so new players wont get in at all.
[2022-12-29 23:01:21] <Ahcydraws> GroupJAM
[2022-12-29 23:01:25] <%polig> @Niki_xyOn it wont work no one will want to waste time over small reward and big one would be abused
[2022-12-29 23:01:36] <%AncientCapitals> you have DPS meters, you have RaiderIO score, you have gear score and so on
[2022-12-29 23:01:49] <%AncientCapitals> and there is no "learning parties"
