[2022-12-21 17:12:14] <%TigerLuv> optimus_blaster you can see the lights on the storage drive thing, over on the wall
[2022-12-21 17:12:24] <sidsayian> so its not java realm or anything right
[2022-12-21 17:12:25] <PureSpider> i thought crafting cards only requested the craft from the system?
[2022-12-21 17:12:30] <razborsek> Crafting cards dont work like that
[2022-12-21 17:12:33] <PureSpider> you still need the auto crafting setup to actually craft it
[2022-12-21 17:12:37] <jayrickson87> making sure you have passive polymer clay automation should be you first priority
[2022-12-21 17:12:43] <officialhunterx> @razborsek ive been trying to make the poinrt
[2022-12-21 17:12:44] <%0omkins> Don't Crafters hold like 10 patterns?
[2022-12-21 17:12:51] <sidsayian> oh wait
[2022-12-21 17:13:11] <sidsayian> you can use the big puffy tree things with sugar cane
[2022-12-21 17:13:12] <officialhunterx> no
[2022-12-21 17:13:14] <%nitroussss17> It might work in a compacting drawer
[2022-12-21 17:13:14] <SeaOfMadness_> just plant a block of rubber trees
[2022-12-21 17:13:23] <optimus_blaster> @TigerLuv cool thanks
[2022-12-21 17:13:27] <PureSpider> crafting cards only request the craft, you still need an actual auto crafting system to craft it
[2022-12-21 17:13:32] <officialhunterx> crafting cards only request
[2022-12-21 17:13:35] <officialhunterx> from the network
[2022-12-21 17:13:40] <jayrickson87> @0omkins in this pack there is pattern storage upgrades you can make up to 40 slots
[2022-12-21 17:13:49] <officialhunterx> if the patterns already exist

[2022-12-21 17:36:19] <Jibbur> nah, if you are doing it via software to connect to them, you can do it once and it applies to all 20

[2022-12-21 18:05:15] <%bobolpwnz> 1 amp is fine
[2022-12-21 18:05:16] <stormzwest> 1A MV
[2022-12-21 18:05:21] <MonteKuchen> depends on which wire you want to use
[2022-12-21 18:05:34] <%Abyssal_Hawk> you were looking at HV
[2022-12-21 18:05:37] <Syrkaz> @kenshin2666 Any language that gets you excited about building stuff is a good starting language! :) You can translate most knowledge from one language to another… It's mostly changing syntax, but the fundamental principles translate well. It's more important to go "deep" first, and then start going wide (to to deep elsewhere whenever you get excited about something)
[2022-12-21 18:05:37] <MonteKuchen> 1 amp means you need one converter per machine
[2022-12-21 18:05:47] <EevoPeevo> Thicc wire?
[2022-12-21 18:05:48] <+b0ltz12> IIRC determines the number of machines that can be run at the same time.

[2022-12-21 18:06:15] <PureSpider> @kenshin2666 💯
[2022-12-21 18:06:27] <MonteKuchen> but if you use a 16amp converter you need 16x wire on the whole line
[2022-12-21 18:06:38] <%Venxuri> each machine uses 1A by default, bad cables also lose Amps, 16A is best but v expensive, 4A should be good enough
[2022-12-21 18:06:39] <+kenshin2666> @XxPyrooxX  so much googling haha. every time its like "okay so i want to do X, how do i do that, and fit it in to what i already got"
[2022-12-21 18:06:43] <+stormblaz> nice walmart wir3
[2022-12-21 18:06:50] <MonteKuchen> it can run 4 amps of lv at once
[2022-12-21 18:06:55] <%bobolpwnz> 4 amps = 4 machines working at the same time max
[2022-12-21 18:07:01] <MonteKuchen> depends on recipe

[2022-12-21 18:08:28] <jayrickson87> I always made 16a so more machines can run all at once
[2022-12-21 18:08:30] <Trollsamaa> with the setup you have, not really. but if you have to run wires long distance, using the smallest wire you need saves a fair bit

[2022-12-21 18:37:39] <%+CoolAcid> I wish they had a basket that you could dump stuff into that would order on the same day. So like, dump all the house hold things into one basket that would order every Thursday.

[2022-12-21 18:38:13] <%$mobfarmer> subscribe and save.. gets you a 5 or 15% discount
[2022-12-21 18:38:13] <%GeekJenn> And you get a discount so it's great

[2022-12-21 18:39:33] <%+CoolAcid> @PureSpider I mean, it would auto-buy what ever is in the basket on the day you set. So instead of lots of small orders, you get one per week.

[2022-12-21 19:32:36] <Trollsamaa> if you are not using the MV too hewavy, a buffer could actually be a decent solution. at least to sidestep the duty cycle issue whiloe working on the new power

[2022-12-21 21:14:00] <%+LaroStar007> imagine tying to the Twitch Sub as the reference currency
[2022-12-21 21:14:01] <+wr1th3> only after 100k though right?
[2022-12-21 21:14:02] <+AdamMcAdamson> Is it not marginal?
[2022-12-21 21:14:02] <@%+Nexhunter> twitch does it progressively KEKW
[2022-12-21 21:14:10] <+Crossed_legion> after or total?
[2022-12-21 21:14:13] <Al_Kappaccino> boardroom decision
[2022-12-21 21:14:16] <+HyperKitty_> why isn't it bound to the bracket
[2022-12-21 21:14:16] <+Traverus98> it should be 50/50 over the cap not for all subs
[2022-12-21 21:14:16] <Comrade_Suhov> Sell bathwater?
[2022-12-21 21:14:18] <@%+Nexhunter> it folks not understanding how a progressive system works with regard to brackets KEKW

[2022-12-21 21:14:41] <%+Tasar_> take my money
[2022-12-21 21:14:44] <@%+Nexhunter> cause more subs is easier than selling and supporting merch
[2022-12-21 21:14:46] <Driitzz> gamer boi bath water , take my money sir
[2022-12-21 21:14:49] <+b0ltz12> the twitch execs wanted more money, so they made the split better for themselves, imo
[2022-12-21 21:14:52] <Milanimal> bathwater with NFT mystery box youd be rich
[2022-12-21 21:15:01] <$ShadowBlade72> @Nexhunter Yeah, this is like the same argument for high tax brackets and people claiming they'll actually lose money if they "get a raise".
[2022-12-21 21:15:01] <+AlphaSchnauzer> so 100k and 140k pays the same for you. KEKW
[2022-12-21 21:15:01] <Battle_Crow> surely its 50% after that, right?  like a tax bracket?
[2022-12-21 21:15:03] <+Swocoom> is it 6 figures pre or post tax?
[2022-12-21 21:15:06] <%Dagmoo> yeah if you are approaching 100k you literally dont want more subs

[2022-12-21 21:15:43] <+Crossed_legion> go to youtube

[2022-12-21 21:15:45] <GuardMoony> Waffle Code NFT from AOC
[2022-12-21 21:15:46] <%ImNotDonut_> maybe they have special contracts?
[2022-12-21 21:15:48] <+F1r3punch> Cause they dont wanna deal with keeping them on platform
[2022-12-21 21:15:49] <+CommanderUrsus> stockBezos gib more
[2022-12-21 21:15:51] <Doomwyte> no, cause they lump it for all channels
[2022-12-21 21:15:52] <+HyperKitty_> they don't care as much perhaps
[2022-12-21 21:15:53] <%+LaroStar007> @Giantwaffle imagine valuating in Giantwaffle T1 Subs... Like... the GDP of the US is X GWT1S
[2022-12-21 21:15:54] <%+lvyEartman> more than 6 figures, you mean more than 100k, or 1 mill?
[2022-12-21 21:16:00] <Intohimos> isn't that against TOS?
[2022-12-21 21:16:05] <bartjedb> Not Even thinking about Lirik Sadge
[2022-12-21 21:16:07] <%GarlicJelly> KEKW
[2022-12-21 21:16:09] <%Dagmoo> yeah he definitely does on main channel
[2022-12-21 21:16:13] <tandazo03> But xQc and others get spacial treatment and still get 70/30s
[2022-12-21 21:16:18] <%TheWonderLlama> RIP everything
[2022-12-21 21:16:19] <%+deathfroma6ove9> y not 4?
[2022-12-21 21:16:30] <Doomwyte> @Intohimos no, parttners can ask for another channel with subs, bunch of streamers do it
[2022-12-21 21:16:43] <%Dagmoo> @intohimos plenty of streamers have 2 channels so its definitely ok
[2022-12-21 21:16:46] <@%+Nexhunter> also it $100k @lvyEartman
[2022-12-21 21:16:59] <tandazo03> Oh wow I didn’t know that
[2022-12-21 21:17:02] <Doomwyte> @Giantwaffle Jonbams has 2 channels and he said twitch lumps them together, so I don't think 2 channels bypasses it
[2022-12-21 21:17:04] <@%+Nexhunter> more of costs
[2022-12-21 21:17:14] <SeaOfMadness_> Bahroo gets 50K for the amount of ads he runs. Don't know the timeframe

[2022-12-21 21:17:23] <+nothenewmemeguy> And here I thought it way the other way around where small streamers made like 50/50 on subs and bigger streamers made 70/30
[2022-12-21 21:17:31] <%ImNotDonut_> @SeaOfMadness_ 1 month is the usual time frame for ad incentives
[2022-12-21 21:17:31] <Intohimos> @Dagmoo I remember couple years ago it was against TOS maybe something changed 🤷
[2022-12-21 21:17:43] <+8R00KS> I assume its only sub revenue and not ad revenue?
[2022-12-21 21:17:44] <Cpt_Ruby> that's crazy
[2022-12-21 21:17:49] <@%+Nexhunter> if they run ads
[2022-12-21 21:17:52] <@%+Nexhunter> then they will make more
[2022-12-21 21:17:54] <%DrHax_> speaking about a lot of money, @Giantwaffle did you see the new PoE Core Support Packs already? WAYTOODANK
[2022-12-21 21:17:55] <%+Grumpage> yeah but moving to YT would lose them more
[2022-12-21 21:17:58] <%+ohbi78> theres nowhere else to go to do this tho sadly
[2022-12-21 21:18:03] <pi70n> more sponsored streams than
[2022-12-21 21:18:03] <Driitzz> they get it back from ads lmao
[2022-12-21 21:18:05] <%praxiz> Why don't they pool their money and make a new streaming platform? How much could that cost, really?
[2022-12-21 21:18:06] <@%+Nexhunter> they upped ad split
[2022-12-21 21:18:11] <+8R00KS> turbo gang run all the ads
[2022-12-21 21:18:12] <Doomwyte> they want people to play more ads so they can make more money from sponsers
[2022-12-21 21:18:18] <+HyperKitty_> what proportion of their income even comes from subs anyway
[2022-12-21 21:18:19] <%Tenkaichi500> isnt like the lowest ad is like 7 ads per hour
[2022-12-21 21:18:20] <Spirevipp> @praxiz KEKW
[2022-12-21 21:18:20] <Driitzz> they go HAM with their ads
[2022-12-21 21:18:25] <@%+Nexhunter> january is garbage for advertising
[2022-12-21 21:18:26] <%+LaroStar007> @praxiz make an Open Sourced Platform
[2022-12-21 21:18:27] <+Raffataff> Incentivise or force...
[2022-12-21 21:18:31] <+i_am_davis> turbo gang rise up
[2022-12-21 21:18:32] <@%+Nexhunter> and also you would be late for any actual Q1 bookings
[2022-12-21 21:18:32] <IHaveShirts> but the bounties seem to be pretty good
[2022-12-21 21:18:35] <InternetPlumber> it will just drive them to also take in more money off platform like personal sponsorships
[2022-12-21 21:18:37] <tandazo03> That’s so limiting to the company tho. Cause less motivation for growth for  smaller streamers
[2022-12-21 21:18:37] <%+Grav1s> Guessing this is why I’ve been seeing more larger streamers doing more #sponsored streams.
[2022-12-21 21:18:41] <Frag_Magnet_> I heard its 10 min of ads per hour for some
[2022-12-21 21:18:41] <+bugsplatter23> ads are bad in recessions too, so there's that to look forward to
[2022-12-21 21:18:45] <Umoeder1> I really dont likt the 5 ad strike

[2022-12-21 21:19:21] <+HyperKitty_> @tandazo03 small streamers will take whatever growth they can get, I don't think they're in much of a place to be picky
[2022-12-21 21:19:23] <@%+Nexhunter> @bugsplatter23 for streamers they are late to Q1 bookings for companies, most ad spending for Q1 would have been already laid out by beginning of Q4

[2022-12-21 21:19:28] <SeaOfMadness_> I got 7 ads one where 5 were the same one, back to back
[2022-12-21 21:19:29] <tandazo03> I’ve gotten 8 ads before
[2022-12-21 21:19:30] <Driitzz> i go to a channel , see prerolls , im like nah ill go somewhere else
[2022-12-21 21:19:30] <bartjedb> @giantwaffle the Banner ads Are fine
[2022-12-21 21:19:34] <TheResinger> yeah I will never not use ad blocking
[2022-12-21 21:19:35] <lilgangstagoth1> i get the odd 8hr add on youtube now

[2022-12-21 21:19:55] <nvrmissashot> @Giantwaffle do you still have your "never played ads badge"? I know you did a year or 2 ago
[2022-12-21 21:20:01] <Al_Kappaccino> yeah checking out diff streams is terrible with preroll
[2022-12-21 21:20:01] <+lateknighthero> ads would be fine if they were like banner or minimized the stream but didnt block it entirely, losing many minutes of content without any way to see it cause amazon is greedy and likes Wendy's money is just horrible
[2022-12-21 21:20:02] <%Rongoel> Also i hate that the ads break the interaction. Like i loose what i am tryign to watch
[2022-12-21 21:20:04] <Shantrix> trying to find a new stream is pain i stop doing it and just watch the same 3 streamers
[2022-12-21 21:20:05] <%+Grumpage> I get ads here as well
[2022-12-21 21:20:06] <%$Tro95> Andy Jassy is making Amazon become revenue-focused rather than customer-focused
[2022-12-21 21:20:08] <Al_Kappaccino> turbo ftw
[2022-12-21 21:20:09] <%+ohbi78> turbo has sorta saved twitch for me - no prerolls
[2022-12-21 21:20:10] <tomey36> Adds on twitch are out of control
[2022-12-21 21:20:10] <Spirevipp> YEP thats why i never look for any new channels

[2022-12-21 21:20:10] <+Thr0h> just get Turbo

[2022-12-21 21:20:11] <+AlphaSchnauzer> I stopped searching tbh
[2022-12-21 21:20:13] <+orneryman> for how much i watch twitch turbo was the best investment
[2022-12-21 21:20:13] <+8R00KS> But who gets the money is the thing
[2022-12-21 21:20:21] <%+Kaines> you watch add longer than the stream if you look for someone to watch
[2022-12-21 21:20:21] <InternetPlumber> i'm dreading when twitch fucks turbo
[2022-12-21 21:20:21] <Al_Kappaccino> yeah
[2022-12-21 21:20:22] <%praxiz> if you pause a stream, for whatever reason, and then unpause it, you get ads
[2022-12-21 21:20:24] <%Dagmoo> prerolls and no ads like waffle does is 100% the best way imo
[2022-12-21 21:20:24] <+Crossed_legion> even adblock sucks
[2022-12-21 21:20:30] <+bugsplatter23> imagine if you had to watch an ad every time you flipped channel on TV
[2022-12-21 21:20:31] <kypudo> ublock ftw
[2022-12-21 21:20:33] <+Galline> i also have the problem where when i join a stream and get a preroll the audio is messed up so i have to refresh and then i get another preroll -.-
[2022-12-21 21:20:33] <Driitzz> fuck turbo ill never pay for that
[2022-12-21 21:20:41] <coolcake2> twitch prime doesnt even block ads anymore

[2022-12-21 21:20:55] <+AlphaSchnauzer> 1000+
[2022-12-21 21:20:56] <%praxiz> "because of the zeros" he says ... so how did that engineering degree go? :D
[2022-12-21 21:20:56] <lordsandwish> Yoy mean monthly?
[2022-12-21 21:20:59] <Linkitch> I know some streamers can get $35k for running 3-5 ads an hour for like a month.
[2022-12-21 21:21:04] <+8R00KS> but if there is a buffer on prerolls only first person gets paid
[2022-12-21 21:21:04] <Muricanplayer> 1000-9999 is 4
[2022-12-21 21:21:05] <nellydocs> is there something different with the pistons in this modpack ? mine wont move :/
[2022-12-21 21:21:06] <sentient_pancakes> meanwhile every 30-60 minutes streams tend to bug out for me and i have to refresh and get another preroll
[2022-12-21 21:21:07] <%+Grumpage> so you make $99.99 max?
