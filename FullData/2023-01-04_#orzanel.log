[2023-01-04 13:16:12] <!%basin79> Come now Mr Orzanel. You don't have 330mm pen. That's just your average pen. You might have only had 248mm for those particular shots.

[2023-01-04 13:18:27] <!%basin79> But it just shows the insanity of WoT. The HEAT can be as low as 248mm. Yet because you see the average as 330mm you automatically think it will be 330mm.
