[2023-01-03 09:35:42] <@%Dark_Fable> FFXIV they design the armor on Hyur, then rescale for the other races. Its why it mostly looks best on the normal human sized races

[2023-01-03 12:28:59] <@%+operatorviera> Imagine Sleepi if they killed Thancred
[2023-01-03 12:29:00] <Snowwraith> I don't really count that she already effectively got written out and then she came back to be written out again.
[2023-01-03 12:29:02] <tf_reeee> Clap Urianger  Clap in  Clap the  Clap bin  Clap
[2023-01-03 12:29:03] <!%LulubyVT> honestly if one of the twins die and the other becomes a villain
[2023-01-03 12:29:06] <!%LulubyVT> imma cry my eyes out
[2023-01-03 12:29:08] <!%DeeNugLife> omg Alisae has her Evil Willow from Buffy the Vampire Slayer arc?
[2023-01-03 12:29:08] <%Mellentt> i mean minfilia was with the mother crystal since end of ARR
[2023-01-03 12:29:09] <chobii> i call them minitifa for whatever reason
[2023-01-03 12:29:09] <!%LulubyVT> but it'd be so good
[2023-01-03 12:29:10] <!%DeeNugLife> I'm here for it
[2023-01-03 12:29:13] <@%DosesMimosaz> what if kill tataru and everyone goes crazy and evil
[2023-01-03 12:29:14] <chobii> instead of minifilia

[2023-01-03 12:29:29] <@%+operatorviera> I feel like the twins are the people we are sharing our journey with cos they are with us in the starting cutscenes
[2023-01-03 12:29:43] <@InfiniteYeet> Tataru goes crazy from being neglected for years and finally uses all of her funds to make a machine more powerful than Alexander Stare

[2023-01-03 12:30:23] <@%Dark_Fable> I really get where your coming from Aiya, but honestly I prefer a story be well writen with actual unexpected shock vs instant easy shock via death
[2023-01-03 12:30:28] <!%+Edrem> the game straight up says the twins are adults now and the community still won't accept it, you think they'll accept tall elezen KEKW
[2023-01-03 12:30:31] <@%+operatorviera> I agree Aiya with aged twins
[2023-01-03 12:30:32] <@%Dark_Fable> death always feel lazy to me
[2023-01-03 12:30:34] <!%LulubyVT> ff16 but the twins are now our boomers
[2023-01-03 12:30:45] <!%LulubyVT> like mega boomers
[2023-01-03 12:30:46] <@InfiniteYeet> They could do something like show Four Cheese and Ambulance as younger kids so they look similar to their kids and then see how people react
[2023-01-03 12:30:59] <!%LulubyVT> er

[2023-01-03 12:31:51] <Snowwraith> You can still write it badly.
[2023-01-03 12:31:52] <%Mellentt> pretty sure the first oldy will be yshtola. what with her becoming her mentor
[2023-01-03 12:31:56] <MelonPantsu> tataru is being saved as the final end boss

[2023-01-03 12:32:08] <%epiknub> We should kill off Graha he would have a good death that would hurt people :)
[2023-01-03 12:32:09] <!%DeeNugLife> - and scene
[2023-01-03 12:32:14] <@%DosesMimosaz> tataru is actually an old god
[2023-01-03 12:32:28] <%Mellentt> i mean a lot of people are dting, just no one you care about
[2023-01-03 12:32:35] <!%ManaMichelle> classic anime death tho
[2023-01-03 12:32:56] <!%Ennendra> I really disliked the whole ending zone story for Endwalker imo because of the death-baiting
[2023-01-03 12:32:58] <%epiknub> Fake deaths/too vanilla make for bad stories. Need an iconic death
[2023-01-03 12:33:00] <!%+Edrem> funfact chat, she says "a certain lalafel" because she forgot his name Madge
[2023-01-03 12:33:07] <@%+operatorviera> Yeah but if you merch a character that ends that characters ability to have growth
[2023-01-03 12:33:17] <tf_reeee> Kill Hildibrand  GIGACHAD

[2023-01-03 12:34:31] <@%+operatorviera> that sounds like YoshiP trolling the player base
[2023-01-03 12:35:08] <+Nevarato> didn't the nier guy want to delete ppl's characters? KEKW
[2023-01-03 12:35:15] <@%+operatorviera> if they try to kill Ilse i will murder EVERYONE, too much gametime for that shit
[2023-01-03 12:35:23] <%Mellentt> kill the player, reincarnate on a new reflection at level one as a new class
[2023-01-03 12:35:31] <@%Dark_Fable> what im saying is to me keeping an interesting character around > even a heart wrenching death. I want deaths to be "earned", like the characters arc is done. I hate "wasted" potential killing a character halfway through their story

[2023-01-03 12:36:55] <@%+operatorviera> well DeeNug tried to not spoil it smh
[2023-01-03 12:37:12] <!%+Edrem> they've moved all the deaths onto side characters now in 14, which is good because they've stopped doing the fake outs
[2023-01-03 12:37:42] <@%+operatorviera> They gave us plenty of death in shadowbringers
[2023-01-03 12:37:56] <%Mellentt> dyne was already shot so he wouldve possibly died anyway but went over a cliff so he couldnt be helped
