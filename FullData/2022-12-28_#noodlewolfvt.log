[2022-12-28 00:41:07] <%$Dio444777> it might be a loophole, like how delta 8 thc is legal in my state because the law specifically says delta 9 is illegal but doesn't mention other compounds

[2022-12-28 20:29:59] <%$Maldoran_> As far as I know the main reason Canadian candies aren't available in the US is that Nestle the main producer can't get distribution rights in the US.
[2022-12-28 20:30:09] <%Paulus_jr> The UK put heavy tax on sugar so most of our sweets dont use a lot of it compared to the US
