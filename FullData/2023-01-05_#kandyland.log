[2023-01-05 08:38:43] <2TREADx> Is your GPU driver updated using NVIDIA Geforce experience? if not, that could be causing problems. @Kandyland
[2023-01-05 08:38:57] <2TREADx> the driver specifically
[2023-01-05 08:39:14] <thegeezster> can I be your floor matt?

[2023-01-05 08:42:48] <gilharday> maybe there are programs you have that don't work together and cause a crash?
[2023-01-05 08:42:57] <2TREADx> @detriod, she said the GPU driver came from a windows update, this is a known cause of that very error on the OBS forum
[2023-01-05 08:43:01] <SwedishForestEngineer> Nvidia is the problem Kappa

[2023-01-05 10:19:19] <%kostasgggg> because s3x is so good. like ahhhhh lalalalallalalalla yes ahhhhh @Quickfaith
[2023-01-05 10:19:21] <imosh> I feel the same, but then again, I remember how much I've learnt and grown from those encounters
[2023-01-05 10:19:26] <%+bruceleroy1111> oh, i think you mean insecure

[2023-01-05 10:20:12] <+validationnation> totally valid
[2023-01-05 10:20:14] <%+bruceleroy1111> would be better if women didnt use men for validation, for the woman

[2023-01-05 10:20:50] <illtakemytimewithem> guys use women for validation too. both genders are guilty of this
[2023-01-05 10:20:56] <2TREADx> People are social animals, if they can get validation easy, they will.
[2023-01-05 10:21:00] <+validationnation> the dilemma is that sometimes toxic relationships can be helpful tho sadly
