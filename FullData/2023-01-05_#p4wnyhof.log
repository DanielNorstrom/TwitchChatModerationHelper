[2023-01-05 10:30:22] <Dinzyy> Armaguerra has 657ms TTK in WZ1 so 500ms compared to that is pretty fast. If we get longer TTk for close range and keep long range TTK as it is, would be amazing

[2023-01-05 14:25:46] <%+xwurzel> @xwurzel Anno 1800 is the latest one. i liked it. otherwise Anno 1404 (but that's from 2009)
[2023-01-05 14:26:10] <@%CSChaos91> @xwurzel my personal favourite is the 1701 because it combines the old classic one with some refreshing stuff. but if you want it more complex go with 1800 which is the newest
