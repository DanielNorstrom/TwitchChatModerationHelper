[2022-12-27 02:57:08] <%$The5oClockShadow> @KOOLSM0KE I guess I'd say 'ease of use' is different than 'this game has _some_ thing that appeals to most gamers, fro story, to art, action, music, etc'. FPS are more straight forward if you've done FPS for sure, but it's even unique in that realm in some mechanics
[2022-12-27 02:57:09] <%KOOLSM0KE> @thorn_42 bit the difference is doom has difficulty settings which aides in player enjoyment. I get what you're saying about elden ring, but it too has its fast hardcore moments with bosses.

[2022-12-27 02:58:59] <%+Thorn_42> @KOOLSM0KE And maybe part of what I am thinking is that Doom Eternal takes a lot of energy to play. Its physically exhausting. Much more than many other games.

[2022-12-27 03:01:41] <%+Thorn_42> Yes, I agree. Glass Onion was definitely good, but the pacing was bad and it was definitely stilted.
[2022-12-27 03:01:41] <%$The5oClockShadow> @KOOLSM0KE I get it, I think that some fighting games are chaos, but I don't really play those. I enjoy watching and playing Hades and Doom eqully, they scratch different itches for me
[2022-12-27 03:01:42] <%+MikeConcho> So were you aware TSM made that video before they put it up?
[2022-12-27 03:01:50] <%+robbobert> i thought it was a spot-on portrayal of elon musk honestly

[2022-12-27 03:03:46] <%KOOLSM0KE> re8 gameplay was great. the story fell apart so much and had nothing to make you feel like this could happen. putting a dead baby back together kind of sealed that for em.

[2022-12-27 04:07:44] <%+CaliggyJack> It's because there is a hardcore contingent of Doom fans who are REALLY into the lore, like the comics and side games and shit. Originally Doom 2016 wasn't even supposed to have anything related to previous games, but the fans got so uppity about the vagueness of the story that it forced the writers to insert the Doom 64 connections into Eternal.

[2022-12-27 16:34:24] <%+Sorry4HavingFun> maybe its just me but from a watchers perspective romhacks lately have been more "guess the gimmick" and less "really cool/hard platforming". So for me i just tune out
[2022-12-27 16:34:25] <%destructo__spin> What upcoming games are you looking forward to?

[2022-12-27 16:45:00] <Retalia2> As the relative experience and skill of the community increases, the quality will be sacrificed for difficulty in an attempt to create something people find hard again @barbarousking

[2022-12-27 16:45:07] <de_surge> DC wanted to copy marvel and didnt take the time to set up anything. They wanted to skip straight to Thanos and get that avengers money.

[2022-12-27 16:46:47] <niceguy7734> This is very easy, i can rush to the goal in 1 run
[2022-12-27 16:46:47] <%+darkart800> no where near as painful as casio

[2022-12-27 16:46:58] <GluecksTaube> but I think that's the point, it looks impressive, which is more than enough for the viewer base that would never play kaizo

[2022-12-27 17:10:54] <%BelAirJeff> a barb sleep stream would probably be mildly successful
[2022-12-27 17:11:01] <alicekhaajiit> new squads, harder difficulty
[2022-12-27 17:11:02] <%$EternalHav0c> keep playing to unlock new squads but if that doesnt hold value for you then you might be done with the game and thats fine
[2022-12-27 17:11:02] <%FreshPrinceOfRockBand> i wouldnt be able to handle streaming as a full-time job

[2022-12-27 17:33:36] <+Zigryous> the only thing subway had going for them was the cheapness.  if you were poor you could get a foot of sandwhich for 5 bucks, not it seems they're on the same price level of everbody else, but their quality is shit

[2022-12-27 17:37:55] <%FlowersForAlgorithm> and the attitude is "hey, we took this successful and popular series and fixed it."
[2022-12-27 17:37:57] <Showsni> @SpeaksBrittlish Other Terry Pratchett adaptations seem to be hit or miss
[2022-12-27 17:37:59] <%drkirienko> realistically, there will never be an adaptation (or even a translation) that doesnt piss SOMEONE off. and since we're addicted to drama instead of nuanced takes, here we are.
[2022-12-27 17:38:02] <%$corignis> As evidenced with lord of the rings, I LIKE IT when they make good changes (cutting bombadil for instance), but the changes in Rings of Power were just pants on head moronic :(((

[2022-12-27 17:38:58] <SlyProspect> I feel like to many t.v. shows like resident evil or horror games are slowly just throwing more and more Powers into the enemies or people. doesn't feel like a horror show anymore
[2022-12-27 17:38:58] <%theWaitingMole> let me tell you all about Mega Man lore
[2022-12-27 17:38:59] <%SquallGCS> first season of The Witcher could have made the timeline of the story more coherent I think
[2022-12-27 17:38:59] <%TalynOne> Chris Pratt is MegaMan
[2022-12-27 17:39:00] <%+XLVIItheRoman> they'll base a Mega Man movie off of the original NES's game's box art
[2022-12-27 17:39:00] <%drkirienko> was there a story that needed to be told in Sonic?
[2022-12-27 17:39:01] <%mik53afk> yeah, we have to stop dr wily obviously
[2022-12-27 17:39:01] <%dusty_blade> yea how would megaman even translate to something like a movie or show
[2022-12-27 17:39:01] <%CeeJac> Mega Man already had a great cartoon

[2022-12-27 17:56:26] <%DonkeyMintInc> Violent Night was pretty dumb.  Without David Harbour, there’d be no reason for it to be popular.
[2022-12-27 17:56:26] <DurantsHookah> Thoughts on The Godfather trilogy?
[2022-12-27 17:56:31] <%+Sorry4HavingFun> is there some kind of weird mainstream appeal to Avatar that i dont see? I have no clue why anybody cares about it? I watched the first one and was meh besides the visual tech

[2022-12-27 19:20:35] <Retalia2> Glass onion was decent, but the main appeal of knives out was that if you watched the movie again you could pick up on everything. There were so many things that you could have never seen/figured out. So instead of watching along and trying to figure it out you basically had to be told what happened for it to make sense
