[2022-12-10 12:05:56] <%abinator2345> @tobyc280 is this because of the s++ grind
[2022-12-10 12:06:05] <+Zzoner> this the car matt had a while ago right?
[2022-12-10 12:06:11] <alphybac> Run some test race
[2022-12-10 12:06:17] <tobyc280> @abinator2345 yeah people want to do them for the rep
[2022-12-10 12:06:18] <d_mavn> Yeah selling contracts is bread RN
[2022-12-10 12:06:21] <+LyndonJaxson> yea it looks so nice
[2022-12-10 12:06:24] <maikyy96> i mean the first ones to s++ will prob make alot of money from it
[2022-12-10 12:06:29] <itsbigoz16> Does it need a wing?
[2022-12-10 12:06:30] <399g> imagine you drop an rb into this lol
[2022-12-10 12:06:43] <%abinator2345> cant sell it
[2022-12-10 12:06:46] <dafsik> @maikyy96 Not really because u can't sell them
[2022-12-10 12:06:50] <keiranbatavia> didn;t koil say you can't covert
[2022-12-10 12:06:57] <maikyy96> ahhh thats sick
[2022-12-10 12:06:59] <ziurxx> ur basically forced to use it to swap cars
[2022-12-10 12:07:00] <alphybac> What yo
[2022-12-10 12:07:01] <maikyy96> i love that way more
[2022-12-10 12:07:17] <d_mavn> Its about having a hypercar as a VIN
[2022-12-10 12:07:18] <maikyy96> the rare s+ cars no?
[2022-12-10 12:07:20] <399g> just rarity
[2022-12-10 12:07:25] <%+Circelo> yh I think that's right
[2022-12-10 12:07:34] <deathreaper361> they are supposed to be gta cars like the gta online ones
[2022-12-10 12:07:37] <%abinator2345> imagine if a senna boost comes
[2022-12-10 12:07:38] <399g> s++ pinkslip races could be sickkk
[2022-12-10 12:07:43] <+LyndonJaxson> yea definitely
[2022-12-10 12:07:47] <%shay15> Don’t think you can vin S++
[2022-12-10 12:07:55] <maikyy96> u can transfer vins no?
[2022-12-10 12:07:56] <danial9494> i dont think s++ can be converted
[2022-12-10 12:08:03] <+KevinDeBoss23> I think with the debadging, i wouldn't be suprised if they are GTA Online cars
[2022-12-10 12:08:06] <Turki_18> It’s gta cars only no?
[2022-12-10 12:08:12] <399g> truee
[2022-12-10 12:08:15] <+LyndonJaxson> a risk car
[2022-12-10 12:08:30] <maikyy96> makes more sence if everryone gets 1 for them self and thats it
[2022-12-10 12:08:31] <+KevinDeBoss23> Its good that you can't convert them
[2022-12-10 12:08:34] <%+CrispyTunaLuis> its a risk and race with the VIN which is good

[2022-12-10 12:08:46] <d_mavn> Also, how insane will the hacks be
[2022-12-10 12:08:50] <hitchens010> They can keep the look of the car just not the badge
[2022-12-10 12:09:02] <%+CrispyTunaLuis> rather than making money with them but to revive boosting
[2022-12-10 12:09:06] <399g> kaiba stocks boutta be up massive  lolll
[2022-12-10 12:09:10] <+KevinDeBoss23> NSX looking like the ruiner
[2022-12-10 12:09:14] <tobyc280> You would definitely need flair on the hacks
[2022-12-10 12:09:16] <d_mavn> Kaiba stonks up
[2022-12-10 12:09:17] <+faintxxxx> @399g and alfie
[2022-12-10 12:09:21] <%+darkscales> The only way they make hacks harder is to add brail back to hacks
[2022-12-10 12:09:25] <toseethomas> you gunna be the S++ beacon
[2022-12-10 12:09:32] <maikyy96> u think u will be able to only vin these cars or also normal drop offs

[2022-12-10 16:15:55] <Itami7> What is it lacking in would you say?
[2022-12-10 16:16:18] <%abinator2345> it looks like it will give up at a certain steering angle
[2022-12-10 16:16:23] <+ldixt> once u get fittment done on it wont that make a difference wider wheel span
[2022-12-10 16:16:31] <d_mavn> OMG the dubai is still alive
[2022-12-10 16:16:43] <399g> @ldixt nah fitments are purely cosmetic
[2022-12-10 16:16:50] <%yazzzzzzaaa8> yea this seems like a car good drivers can only excel in
[2022-12-10 16:17:00] <%+markwalker92> prob just that corner is so tight
[2022-12-10 16:17:19] <+ldixt> @399g have u seen when the charger gets a central tyre that bug that messes the cars up so surely it makes a little difference
[2022-12-10 16:17:27] <+ashy2bashy> 2.5 was a steal tho
[2022-12-10 16:17:29] <Itami7> It looks cold and u could deffo master it
[2022-12-10 16:17:29] <%s1ndd3r> How is that only cosmetic. You wheels have a bigger span
[2022-12-10 16:17:40] <d_mavn> Overall good purchase?
[2022-12-10 16:17:40] <%yazzzzzzaaa8> its value for the money

[2022-12-10 16:18:10] <%+teewongwho> icl for 2.5 mil i dont think there is a better car you can get
[2022-12-10 16:18:18] <%ikky_0> 2.5 is a steal
[2022-12-10 16:18:18] <%s1ndd3r> @kylicks So the game thinks your wheels are still in the old spot?
[2022-12-10 16:18:30] <%kylicks> @s1ndd3r Yea I assume so

[2022-12-10 16:19:01] <%+stefanvanhouten46> Shouldn’t you just stick to a car and learn it instead of swapping every day because a car gets nerved. A car can be the best car today and shit tomorrow.
[2022-12-10 16:19:02] <+o8j8m> i have a feeling they’ll make one change to it and it will jump in value crazy
[2022-12-10 16:19:10] <399g> @ldixt thats a scuff issue where the axis of the wheel makes it so its central, when the bump speed buff was still there it did make a difference. Now I dont think it will

[2022-12-10 16:20:01] <+KevinDeBoss23> is there an engine swap for this
[2022-12-10 16:20:02] <+dylan7hm> you should ask to use patars car for the serious races
[2022-12-10 16:20:03] <affanseyed> i remember when the nsx was the best car in the city

[2022-12-10 17:21:20] <%+Najeeto> What car is he testing ?
[2022-12-10 17:21:25] <+o8j8m> the mcclaren is broken atm in terms of acceleration

[2022-12-10 17:21:30] <%billz_z_> 100-120 seems sluggish
[2022-12-10 17:21:32] <%kylicks> For a 4 wheel it seems slow acceleration
[2022-12-10 17:21:34] <Elgid2000> i am not going to say it's bad but is a very mid car
[2022-12-10 17:21:38] <%billz_z_> but no idea
[2022-12-10 17:21:48] <%s1ndd3r> Nsx was slightly faster

[2022-12-10 17:22:41] <nando12_2> Worth if you get 1.5
[2022-12-10 17:22:41] <%+teewongwho> you get 1.5m and a car that is the same if not better
[2022-12-10 17:22:41] <jackx_3> Adam might be this off you to for 3 ms
[2022-12-10 17:22:42] <vMuza> Is the NSX worse or better than this?
[2022-12-10 17:22:44] <%+Kenty90> I would counter with 1.75m and hope they counter back with 1.5m
[2022-12-10 17:22:44] <!%krypticfn11> @kylicks oh it's the V8 niceee
[2022-12-10 17:22:55] <beberocker> is Jay on keyboard or controller?

[2022-12-10 17:22:58] <Elgid2000> but are you going to get 1.5 for this don;t think they are giving 1.5 on top
[2022-12-10 17:23:08] <dnlgamingsx> is this the V8?
[2022-12-10 17:23:21] <vMuza> What about a counter offer of 1.25 m
[2022-12-10 17:23:22] <lukewheeler2003> It’s defo a 2.5/3m car   So I’d go for 1.5m cash
[2022-12-10 17:23:26] <+chrisnl12> I'm exited to see you customise it
[2022-12-10 17:23:32] <+ashy2bashy> Looks a bit slow Acceleration
[2022-12-10 17:23:37] <quantum__za> nsx is alot nicer imo. but money is king, and you can just resell this
[2022-12-10 17:23:43] <dnlgamingsx> there's so many custom stuff to do with it LUL LUL
[2022-12-10 17:23:48] <%s1ndd3r> This car seems very wobbly
[2022-12-10 17:24:00] <zipits_> kinda mid but its ok
[2022-12-10 17:24:05] <399g> arnie has some harry potter broomstick lines in this race

[2022-12-10 17:24:30] <dnlgamingsx> @ahmad_karam he didn't customize it
[2022-12-10 17:24:31] <divij_jain> There is some mad customization for this as well right ??
[2022-12-10 17:24:34] <davy_rtl> Does Jay have an end goal car?

[2022-12-10 17:24:52] <d_mavn> Jay playing car swap at this point
[2022-12-10 17:24:54] <zunilf> I like the v8 sound tho
[2022-12-10 17:24:57] <shadowknight_555> idk i feel like you wont do nothing with the money and you will stay again without a car
[2022-12-10 17:24:58] <%eyelovereddit> chats opinions are irrelevant anyways BatChest
[2022-12-10 17:25:17] <knight_wing98> will jay martin stick to one car at this point Kappa
[2022-12-10 17:25:19] <+iciclx> Prefer the nsx but hey at the end of the day it’s your choice so you do you
[2022-12-10 17:25:21] <+o8j8m> worst comes to worst jay buys back a nsx and have more cash than he did originally
[2022-12-10 17:25:24] <+KevinDeBoss23> this was Mary's go to car before
[2022-12-10 17:25:25] <therrealh> It slides a lot more than the nsx and the acceleration ain’t quite there
[2022-12-10 17:25:26] <%abinator2345> its worth
[2022-12-10 17:25:27] <Ahmad_Karam> we are Aware
[2022-12-10 17:25:27] <pixeled12> the only opinion jay needs is jaymartin4mdm's
[2022-12-10 17:25:30] <+Ryanbutler2001> it’s a decent deal tbh
[2022-12-10 17:25:33] <+Bassgod42> is it a 2 seater or 4?
[2022-12-10 17:25:33] <Elgid2000> defac3GIGACHAD

[2022-12-10 17:25:49] <emilyisme8> @pixeled12 true honestly
[2022-12-10 17:25:51] <jordan_fisher> You think you can flip it for a better car
[2022-12-10 17:25:54] <+o8j8m> it’s not like you lose the chance of ever owning a nsx again LUL
[2022-12-10 17:26:03] <%ikzauul> Change the wing as well
[2022-12-10 17:26:04] <%billz_z_> I guess its either the money or a better racing car
[2022-12-10 17:26:06] <zqamz> its a good car but there is a chance they might change it
[2022-12-10 17:26:19] <+mxzly96> should get it for the intentions to flip it
[2022-12-10 17:26:20] <dnlgamingsx> there's also the wide body one Kreygasm
[2022-12-10 17:26:22] <%ikky_0> i really like it ic
[2022-12-10 17:26:34] <%ikzauul> At least you’ll have more money when you want a new car too
[2022-12-10 17:26:41] <%billz_z_> Christmas decorations?

[2022-12-10 17:26:45] <philiplmao> new vlc?
[2022-12-10 17:26:48] <L3FT_ALONE> The customisations are what makes this car worth it tbh
[2022-12-10 17:26:48] <Itami7> A massive arrow and apartments
[2022-12-10 17:26:48] <+alpha_psycho1> a bunch of apartments
[2022-12-10 17:26:49] <%kylicks> Probably Christmas decorations
[2022-12-10 17:26:50] <Ahmad_Karam> worth taking still
[2022-12-10 17:26:51] <%Twicks__> if youre gonna stick with reselling this deal is decent
[2022-12-10 17:26:51] <%10bloo> vlc
[2022-12-10 17:26:52] <%ikky_0> apartments
[2022-12-10 17:26:56] <tebb1234> It’s apartments
[2022-12-10 17:26:56] <bigbean2121> New gun
[2022-12-10 17:26:58] <MoistPocketLent> Apartments
[2022-12-10 17:27:01] <+FaizanV2> maybe new apartments or Christmas decorations
[2022-12-10 17:27:02] <+bilal1572> new vlc been in for a few days
[2022-12-10 17:27:02] <%kylicks> Oh yea apartments
[2022-12-10 17:27:05] <+o8j8m> gallery has been in for a day or two already it’s not tha
[2022-12-10 17:27:06] <jackx_3> It’s not the vlc it’s optimised
[2022-12-10 17:27:08] <%X1XMISSION> Could be the big arrow in the sky
[2022-12-10 17:27:12] <L3FT_ALONE> Like 50 new apartments and Christmas decorations
[2022-12-10 17:27:18] <Itsfaz88> arrow and apartments
[2022-12-10 17:27:26] <+FaizanV2> a massive arrow or apartments
[2022-12-10 17:27:29] <%+shotty233> I think it’s worth if u can get 1.2 to 1.5 tbf
[2022-12-10 17:27:30] <+o8j8m> apartments and decorations
[2022-12-10 17:27:30] <jackx_3> Could be Mike blocks arrow the apartment
[2022-12-10 17:27:35] <%kylicks> Ain't the arrow gone now tho ??
[2022-12-10 17:27:43] <+zain828z> how many strikes does the car have?
[2022-12-10 17:28:02] <therrealh> Ask 1.7 then they could counter down to 1.5
[2022-12-10 17:28:03] <%ikzauul> Go look at the customise stuff before restarting the game
[2022-12-10 17:28:06] <mora61> Worst case you just keep the nsx if she dosent also give money
[2022-12-10 17:28:11] <jackx_3> You should deffo squeeze as much money out of them as possible they rich rich
[2022-12-10 17:28:22] <rey_okami> I still think nsx is better just cuz of it’s slick body it could squeeze thru more stuff
