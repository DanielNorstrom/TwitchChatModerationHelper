[2022-12-23 16:13:29] <%leunamand> Molina is in draft now too LUL Shame the other day he didn't appear

[2022-12-23 16:13:46] <correia301> @hazzat1345 ok thanks for clarifying. So just a personal goal right. In terms of packs, is it worth it?
[2022-12-23 16:13:57] <+smokeymcpot_99> No loss glitch
[2022-12-23 16:14:00] <%hazzat1345> @dawg_pacific SBC players are in draft

[2022-12-23 16:14:08] <+filthyjmoney35> You gotta watch a celebration in order to lose the draft
[2022-12-23 16:14:09] <+eder724136> Because I believe only 54 tokens have been released and there was 60 in concepts

[2022-12-23 16:15:04] <+RazorKameo> same with winter wildcards there 30 tokens in concept but they said only 25 will release
[2022-12-23 16:15:16] <%+Kieran96cfc> putting 60 into concepts probably tricked so many people into taking different rewards thinking they'd get 60 and not 54
[2022-12-23 16:15:19] <%masonmountskillz69> @8ehnz going outside?
[2022-12-23 16:15:22] <+mickyd2006> the rewards for champs at better atm imo
[2022-12-23 16:15:24] <+1predz> i dont trust my pack luck which has been proven so far
[2022-12-23 16:15:25] <%+tobywankenobi101> get much better fodder too, an 86 gold is better than an 84 red
[2022-12-23 16:15:26] <%jjaden10> I like no red picks but if pack
[2022-12-23 16:15:27] <sweatyarch3d> fifa fallen off so much
[2022-12-23 16:15:28] <+ryounger7> if they go back to red picks, champs will be dead for rewards
[2022-12-23 16:15:33] <harrypicko97> Anyone know what date toty starts?
[2022-12-23 16:15:39] <%hazzat1345> @1predz Personally would rather a chance of a promo card in a pick then a dead low rated inform red
[2022-12-23 16:15:39] <baldchoc> I got harry Kane out of the picks they alr
[2022-12-23 16:15:39] <%fitzyyy7> They put 60 in concepts so they have some extra if they mess up
[2022-12-23 16:15:44] <+iFlightz> Good night everyone, hope you guys have a great day
[2022-12-23 16:15:46] <+eder724136> Damn, I need one more for Cafu but I don‚Äôt think I have time before 6 pm

[2022-12-23 16:15:56] <%+tobywankenobi101> prefer the in form pack for the guarnteed 30k
[2022-12-23 16:16:02] <+mickyd2006> used to just get crappy 83 rateds now at 11 I can atleast get a walkout or 2
[2022-12-23 16:16:02] <+mattyd889> the IF pack was trash when they were 10k
[2022-12-23 16:16:10] <%hazzat1345> Was fortunate enough to get TOTT Theo last week in rewards
[2022-12-23 16:16:17] <%$8ehnz> they should just mix informs with promo cards in the special packs
[2022-12-23 16:16:23] <%FUTDAN26> Do we know how many WW tokens there are? Altogether

[2022-12-23 16:16:32] <USER420D> last two weekends ive got 84 as my highest form the 83x5
[2022-12-23 16:16:36] <%+Kieran96cfc> can you get promo cards in the 85+ picks and pack from champs? if so thats better, but atleast having the chance at a IF mbappe ect is nice

[2022-12-23 16:37:13] <+slang608> i started an rtg played maybe 8 hours and have a sick squad already
[2022-12-23 16:37:13] <@%Viperlization> They haven't shapeshift any other cards though which is odd

[2022-12-23 16:38:16] <correia301> what I dont get are the prizes. I mean I grind so much on rivals to get 8 wins upgrade, to get 90 games for season, and yet, the rewards are so bad... I dont understand how people have such good teams with such rewards... much money must be spent, no other way around
[2022-12-23 16:38:20] <+JidgeMate> dont you think that any game mode will turn into a sweat fest ?

[2022-12-23 16:38:48] <%leunamand> Last year we had a "no rules" gamemode for a while and it was super fun, or that 11 goalkeepers gamemode. Things like that could be fun
[2022-12-23 16:38:53] <%masonmountskillz69> cuz in fifa 13 there were other good games so u didn;t have to rely on fifa

[2022-12-23 17:16:21] <+calcium_77> I thinks it's shocking RTG people like myself have got several players for my team with them
[2022-12-23 17:16:22] <+Metcalfe11> the season progress was their attempt of some kind of battle pass other games do right ?
[2022-12-23 17:16:25] <@%Viperlization> speedruns n dat
[2022-12-23 17:16:29] <%+bongyyyyy> We get the free card at 6?
[2022-12-23 17:16:53] <+Padee> @NepentheZ they will probably do some sort of paid season progress like Battle Passes. I'd actually like that
[2022-12-23 17:17:11] <+vecnaussy> and SBC speed runs could be fun Nep
[2022-12-23 17:17:11] <%+csmacph_> Zerkaa‚Äôs packed out series is quite enjoyable

[2022-12-23 17:17:27] <%+zoe9593> Sounds fun
[2022-12-23 17:17:27] <+calcium_77> I genuinely think the New EAFC game will be shocking it's going to be even worse than now with micro transactions. RTG NMS won't be possible!!!
[2022-12-23 17:17:29] <hmcfc97> Selling 5m + 1400 players ps account , pm if interested

[2022-12-23 17:17:40] <%$Mainzer111> So many things they don't care about. Still have to turn the trainer off and timed finishing on before every game since the start of FIFA 23.

[2022-12-23 17:17:57] <@%Viperlization> Yeah literally
[2022-12-23 17:17:58] <@%Viperlization> 2 weeks
[2022-12-23 17:17:59] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> I like the idea of relegating to div 10 on an account you put points on. And then do a "Road To Elite" series where you use a different team for each 10 games
[2022-12-23 17:18:04] <freshprince8638> What are you getting for Christmas fatty
[2022-12-23 17:18:06] <%+stackmillz> do it

[2022-12-23 17:18:11] <%krk0707> each div up  = 50k to your team
[2022-12-23 17:18:11] <11lfc1892> Maybe a limit of fifa points?

[2022-12-23 17:18:28] <%+azza_shergill> What if you did a road to elite but for each division you use a different team from the most recent promo
[2022-12-23 17:18:41] <$MrMcMikey> nep remember that guy rammer garcia ? LUL
[2022-12-23 17:18:53] <%Exothermicc> Has the rivals grind been done for that 4 hour RTG account yet?
[2022-12-23 17:18:54] <+Cavacom> speed run video at the start of every promo?
[2022-12-23 17:19:07] <iiMsv> could we see league sbcs tonight?
[2022-12-23 17:19:14] VIEWERS: 1¬†734
[2022-12-23 17:19:16] <+baldnose> might need to start day before promo so you can make sure you're qualified for champs before the promo
[2022-12-23 17:19:21] <+winterspeckk> Nep Vieira or fodder packs for the wild card promo?
[2022-12-23 17:19:23] <+Cavacom> @iiMsv possibkle but unlikely
[2022-12-23 17:19:30] <@%Viperlization> you cant relegate tho can you
[2022-12-23 17:19:35] <@%Viperlization> unless you wait 3 seasons
[2022-12-23 17:19:46] <%+zoe9593> I liked it when it was harder to get great players, made you work harder for it. Just my opinion
[2022-12-23 17:19:47] <%oxjacksonx> draft to save the bank if you win pay nothing or depending what round you get knocked out you have to add a cash code
[2022-12-23 17:19:51] <jake123playz> new account?????????
[2022-12-23 17:19:53] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> Or just start a new acocunt you put points on so that you can afford to swap teams out
[2022-12-23 17:20:02] <%+stackmillz> ww rtg would b great
[2022-12-23 17:20:02] <+CDiesel207> Do you expect EA losing the Fifa License will impact the gameplay next year?
[2022-12-23 17:20:13] <%krk0707> how about each time you div up = 100k to your team
[2022-12-23 17:20:25] <@%Viperlization> yeah you're low
[2022-12-23 17:20:37] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> And you can start off small, like non rare team or silver team. And slowly work it up when you pick up more and more coins
[2022-12-23 17:20:42] <%+csmacph_> I wish it was like old fifas where 75 gold rated strikers could destroy the best defence in the game
[2022-12-23 17:20:45] <byggaretod1337> i feel like its either SO easy to get players or SO hard, thoughts? Up until fifa 17 it was super hard to get players but after fifa 17 it has been to easy, its extreme either way
[2022-12-23 17:20:50] <%$kinglester2692> are you not on andy's avent showdown series this year?
[2022-12-23 17:21:05] <%ntblue1034> It's a bit funny that you call it a pay to win account when you don't play any games on it

[2022-12-23 17:21:40] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> Like Noahs2noah videos they are just rivals grinds with different players or teams
[2022-12-23 17:21:41] <%+Chris__Malone> Road to elite div 12k fp every promotion. No restrictions on team but loose the lowest rated player on you team with every loss/draw
[2022-12-23 17:21:41] <%+csmacph_> My account is pay to lose LUL
[2022-12-23 17:21:42] <%+zoe9593> I always just kinda feel like I lose interest quicker each year on fifa, I get a great team earlier and earlier in the fifa cycle
[2022-12-23 17:21:50] <%+zoe9593> Kinda makes me lose interest
[2022-12-23 17:22:10] <dexter__morgann> hi nep, how's those 81+?
[2022-12-23 17:22:11] <%+azza_shergill> What about building a draft and making that your main team for a champs run or per division
[2022-12-23 17:22:33] <azeem454> I hope EA can release some objectives at 6 that we can grind towards
[2022-12-23 17:22:33] <%+csmacph_> Matthaus Mid btw best CDM in the game
[2022-12-23 17:22:39] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> yeah has to be next week
[2022-12-23 17:22:41] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> thats ok though
[2022-12-23 17:22:44] <boomwap5499> Will you be doing the ToTY group chat with vipes Cianni and the other guys?  That‚Äôs always fun viewing ?
[2022-12-23 17:22:45] <+SpentBuffalo> can you pack a special from the 85+ semi final sbc ?
[2022-12-23 17:22:49] <+calcium_77> I would love to see how "easy" it will be to do a true No money spent RTG cause at this point I don't think it's possible. The Fifa scene is that competitive now a days that you will be left sooooo far behind

[2022-12-23 17:23:47] <%+zoe9593> That would be easy though, it‚Äôs so easy to get good players. It took about 45 mins to get pavard completed lol
[2022-12-23 17:23:50] <boomwap5499> I disagree with the no spend. I‚Äôve not spent a penny and every player is first owner and would say is pretty decent
[2022-12-23 17:24:00] <amenger4> Do we think we are getting special TOTY icons like we did for the world cup?
[2022-12-23 17:24:06] <%+warnerbruva> @calcium_77 if anything it‚Äôs too easy, so why would you want to spend more money when you‚Äôve already bought the game
[2022-12-23 17:24:07] <+calcium_77> @jaay_tekz totally agree mate that's what I'm trying to get at the model EA has isn't good enough unlike 2K
[2022-12-23 17:24:08] <+smokeymcpot_99> It‚Äôs never been easier to build an insane team without spending money
[2022-12-23 17:24:08] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> @calcium_77 the pass aggy nature of this message whilst be so hilariously wrong is like a perfect nugget of the internet in its current state
[2022-12-23 17:24:09] <James_Matty> it's possible. You could build a solid 100k-150k team that'll be competitive which wouldn't take that long to get the coins for.
[2022-12-23 17:24:21] <%+arnas86> no money RTG's are still very much doable. In Belgium, we have no FiIFA points for a few years now, kind of got used to it and how to build your account, even this year

[2022-12-23 17:25:24] <calsimpsoni> Yeah that is actually quite unbelievable
[2022-12-23 17:25:29] <+littleshak96> It's so easy! I have played 1 weekend of champs. very little squad battles, and got to div 5 rivals! Hero Forlan, WC Keane, WC Govou, Hero Toure, WC Vieira, RTG Bruno, Showdown Acuna, WC Carvalho, WC Mascherano, WW Trippier, Showdown Pope. With a decent bench!
[2022-12-23 17:25:29] <shantoudiin> sick team for 4 hrs
[2022-12-23 17:25:29] <%+KingViera> There‚Äôs a series a MLB the Show creator does called Pack Squads. Might be a cool idea to do for FIFA. You basically would play Rivals/Champs and open packs based on performance after every game and only use packed players.
[2022-12-23 17:25:34] <+calcium_77> That team ain't allowing you to compete at the highest divisions though
[2022-12-23 17:25:42] <+thirsty2828> is team of tournaament robinson considered a silver chat
[2022-12-23 17:25:51] <sorarejosh> this team illustrates whats wrong with the game

[2022-12-23 17:26:39] <+calcium_77> yes I get 4 hours well done but over a whole year of fifa you look at the amount of promos released you get left behind
[2022-12-23 17:26:41] <%+stackmillz> its ganna take 2 weeks b4 u get to elite and by then the team would b double that
[2022-12-23 17:26:49] <%+csmacph_> Well if hesketh can go 20-0 with a none rare gold team then anythings possible ü§£

[2022-12-23 17:27:58] <IraqiRoadman> maybe I'm doing this wrong. I'm in the elite division, but it's getting difficult playing against Mbappe and Pele every game when I can't save enough for them
[2022-12-23 17:27:59] <+itsrj1991> Maybe he's just spending all of his coins on store packs
[2022-12-23 17:28:00] <gg13theking> it was the 4-4-2 I think bro
[2022-12-23 17:28:02] <11lfc1892> Look at neps previous years when he kept rtg through toty
[2022-12-23 17:28:05] <DucxSauce> this team is soo good

[2022-12-23 17:28:16] <+calcium_77> yes now not from start of game though
[2022-12-23 17:28:16] <+sergibonga> Everyone has an insane team outside of the pool of 20 or so super expensive top players
[2022-12-23 17:28:22] <%+killa_mole> team evolves with promos as u go as well, it doesn't stay stagnant
[2022-12-23 17:28:32] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> @calcium_77 oh ffs
[2022-12-23 17:28:36] <%+danarlli> At the end of the day. Just have fun in the game. It‚Äôs a game!
[2022-12-23 17:28:36] <boomwap5499> My main staring 11 is Voller Al Owairian Brolin  WC Hero‚Äôs then Di Maria enzo Fernandes. Matthaus, and back line is Cancelo IF Tomori and Laporte (special orange card) and Walker RB with new pope in goal all FO. And I‚Äôm 41 who doesn‚Äôt get that much time to play
[2022-12-23 17:28:37] <%+stackmillz> the later u wait to start playing the easier the game becomes good cards become discard
[2022-12-23 17:28:38] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> Hes saying you cant catch up now
[2022-12-23 17:28:39] <insomnixc__> Ive had the game two weeks ( first time playing this game) and have a mega team already also got 14 wins in my first week of champs. I think it helps being good at the game.
[2022-12-23 17:28:40] <milky_snoww> This dude man lmao
[2022-12-23 17:28:42] <DucxSauce> midfield is kinda weak but everything else is good

[2022-12-23 17:28:44] <%krk0707> it's crazy that ronaldo this year is 70k but 3,4 years ago he would be 500k +. fifa has changed

[2022-12-23 17:29:04] <Bonus_Exitus> I also think people think that cards are good bc of the price, I have 4 mil coin WC Eusebio and 60k Gareth Bale and Gareth Bale is def better. Just bc the Icons are expensive doesn't make them better
[2022-12-23 17:29:05] <gg13theking> üò≥ no way lol
[2022-12-23 17:29:09] <+calcium_77> Cr7 is under 100k now like majority of players from start of game without spending fifa points you get left behind FACTS
[2022-12-23 17:29:13] <James_Matty> You could be very casual for a couple weeks and build a competitive squad.
[2022-12-23 17:29:13] <%$blublud84> Pack only in 19 was your best ever series. This year would be even better as pack weight is quite low. It would be hard to get a very good team quickly imo

[2022-12-23 17:30:31] <+Metcalfe11> is he talking about without fifa points its impossible to have a esports "comp" team because id agree there but a competitive team is very very easy to get

[2022-12-23 17:30:40] <Byrne1704> how can people be this delusional, the market is on the floor, you can get a competitive team for 200k this year, which is achievable in a few hours
[2022-12-23 17:30:41] <%krk0707> the 84√ó25 and packs like that provide no fifa point players with better cards

[2022-12-23 17:35:56] <Norris36> Was 650 elo in elite last season with gold Koulibaly and salah. Pretty sure its not the teams fault

[2022-12-23 17:38:49] <%skeroboy10> Because he is doing Eredivisie RTG
[2022-12-23 17:38:49] <+Metcalfe11> people really over estimate the difference of stats from cards to card this game. al owairans 99 pace isnt the reason you cant score using your 95 pace di maria or whoever it might be
[2022-12-23 17:38:49] <jens_mo> I'm in elite, without Mbappe or Al Owairan on a Belgian account, can't even buy coins. I still run a free Gosens with 963 games played and the full team is first owned. If you grind this game, anything is possible.
[2022-12-23 17:38:49] <%bazza3166> he just scored a banger with yaya

[2022-12-23 17:39:11] <$antman2682> I think your team is probably better than an average elite team it‚Äôs just that elite players  are so good and I don‚Äôt enjoy playing at that division.
[2022-12-23 17:39:17] <amenger4> OTW Schlotterbeck is 16k and with a shadow he is a 91 rated CB
[2022-12-23 17:39:17] <+vecnaussy> @chrisg22382 probably not the paredes card since it‚Äôs not a TOTT card

[2022-12-23 17:39:21] <Roboo_95> Do you not think Trippier is good enough for RB?
[2022-12-23 17:39:21] <+calcium_77> So if players are a factor having the best via fifa points give you an advantage hence why I said being left behind from the start of fifa I.e. Gold mbappe from start etc the fact your trying to say its possible to compete at the highest level without spending money is so wrong

[2022-12-23 18:23:48] <%+riff_hunter44> Its not a mystery is it the popular players get special cards
[2022-12-23 18:23:50] <DomMilburn> didnt alexis sanchez get the exact same special card 2 years in a row
[2022-12-23 18:24:03] <$kuruptsnake> I really do wish we would get new players, tired of it always being the same ones
[2022-12-23 18:24:06] <$fawzi158> @NepentheZ what do you think of the idea of removing managers from the game and just have a default manager , and for us to be able to just choose the nation and league, cuz there are so many nations missinf for managers
[2022-12-23 18:24:09] <+Ready_99> Chiellini had 3 SBC cards last year
[2022-12-23 18:24:14] <+Bravia60> Living legend
[2022-12-23 18:24:21] <Richm1996> Should've done Carlos Vela

[2022-12-23 18:24:40] <m4nny1403> Chielini gives chem to ur bale
[2022-12-23 18:24:41] <%CrazyEskimoPenguin> Yeah this year Chiellini makes good sense for the diversity of teams
[2022-12-23 18:24:44] <%+Th1sSecretN1nj4> i would've gotten Arango 100% dude had such a good year as well
[2022-12-23 18:24:46] <+rokerjoker_> I am all for EA giving cards to give OP cards already in the game much needed links

[2022-12-23 18:25:31] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> Bar Musa (who I think is for nostalgia) almost all the cards are solid nation links for their league.

[2022-12-23 18:35:00] <%+Mightynemesis29> a good advice to doing it is instead of thinking of how much wokr just say it will wake you 5 to 10 mminutes to get some of it done

[2022-12-23 19:36:23] <+marshb9> is the 75k pack worth it?
[2022-12-23 19:36:25] <%exclusive457> i agree, i think an 84 or 85 squad would have been plenty, still did him as he fits my team but he is too much
[2022-12-23 19:36:30] <$rogroper> whoch player with his stats cost 30k?
[2022-12-23 19:36:32] <ScHoolboy_Food> neppo! didn‚Äôt realize you had moved from fb to twitch! Been a while since I consumed any fifa content!
[2022-12-23 19:36:36] <%+yasin__7> The only reason to do de Paul is for the Di Maria and enzo link
[2022-12-23 19:36:37] <+10wazzarooney10> Gullit gang from LaLiga and argentina for 30k ??
[2022-12-23 19:36:48] <Sal1171> But is his name de paul?
[2022-12-23 19:36:48] <MarioBr0ther> @NepentheZ compare De Paul to OOP Lucas Vazquez that is <20k
[2022-12-23 19:36:49] <+atxmix> rating is irrelevant, yeah 5* but also has poor defending at shooting idk
[2022-12-23 19:36:51] <+s0uheil> I'm getting myself that Tonali with the swaps they released and grind the rest for the 3 83x25 (fyi i already took Trippier with the first 2 tokens)
[2022-12-23 19:36:53] <%+chriscfcwooooo> crazy we are saying a gullit gang card isn't special. 3 fifa's ago that was unheard off
[2022-12-23 19:36:56] <%Creativename_> of course I got 81 Enzo dude come on EA
[2022-12-23 19:36:56] <opaza01> De Paul is overpriced and just an ok card
[2022-12-23 19:36:57] <+atxmix> i guess maybe
[2022-12-23 19:37:07] <%+ray_rockwood> I was hoping De Paul could play CAM and then I'd pair him with my PTG Griez, but he can't, so De Paul can't replace my Vieira or PTG Brozo

[2022-12-23 19:41:04] <xplopkoekx> de paul in game is a beast tbh
[2022-12-23 19:41:07] <+atxmix> nah im not doing him nep just thought it was interesting
[2022-12-23 19:41:09] <+Track_PadOS> I'm doing him wallah
[2022-12-23 19:41:11] <%Creativename_> They have different value systems though, De Paul being 'bad value' because there's a better unobtainable card in the game can't be used against De Paul if they need a link for Correa/Di Maria
[2022-12-23 19:41:12] <%Da_kapo> Compare his card to robertone
[2022-12-23 19:41:18] <%+rishray> id rather just stick trippier in cm for 2 tokens tbh
[2022-12-23 19:41:23] <+atxmix> @Creativename_ exactly
[2022-12-23 19:41:31] <rjball3> overall thoughts on this promo? seems quality to me
[2022-12-23 19:41:31] <%+eddg_023> Is he better than Macalister?
[2022-12-23 19:41:31] <the_real_mark_henry> It's enough with the Argentinians
[2022-12-23 19:41:31] <%Exothermicc> They gave Verde 99 passing, I'm sure that'll get patched...
[2022-12-23 19:41:34] <+GeorgeCuz> WW's sit at the back of the pack btw nep

[2022-12-23 19:41:44] <zootiiez> dead promo
[2022-12-23 19:41:50] <linus_teo> the thing is there is always someone you can compare to that makes him bad value and someone else that makes him good value relatively
[2022-12-23 19:41:52] <+atxmix> @moistcoot3r hes sensational
[2022-12-23 19:41:53] <%+Evolving_Gaming1> @moistcoot3r agreed
[2022-12-23 19:41:56] <+iFearIess> Also the ppl with the Argentina players should already be on full chem for the most part

[2022-12-23 19:42:21] <%Creativename_> that's true but De Paul has that nice hyperlink
[2022-12-23 19:42:23] <moistcoot3r> and play
[2022-12-23 19:42:31] <andreww3104> like guys he's said that if you want to do him then you can do him , he's just saying that the card is overpriced because on the market they are cheaper that's all

[2022-12-23 19:43:20] <%Creativename_> No way haha I have Correa but he is way too pricey, but this should be the comparison not with Paredes/Enzo etc who you can't get
[2022-12-23 19:43:22] <%+eddg_023> Can you compare him with Macalister please nep?
[2022-12-23 19:43:23] <m4nny1403> LUL LUL LUL

[2022-12-23 19:43:38] <andreww3104> @atxmix yeah I know bro hah , just some dudes won't listen to him hah
[2022-12-23 19:43:39] <+FoNts___> Not really
[2022-12-23 19:43:40] <+grimmers88> Opportunity cost on fodder too
[2022-12-23 19:43:40] <+KA3H> Can you review Toljan?!
[2022-12-23 19:43:44] <amenger4> and you could use that fodder on something else
[2022-12-23 19:43:48] <humanage> it's not as liquid as cash
[2022-12-23 19:43:49] <hecriva> Skills arguably you haven‚Äôt even played with the card‚Ä¶ what if it‚Äôs a cheap card like di maria and just feels so broken ? Idk you can‚Äôt judge til you try
[2022-12-23 19:43:49] <%+stackmillz> de paul base gold was real good at the begining of the game
[2022-12-23 19:43:49] <QueenHeartie> i packed duplicate from champs so i did him no other reason to do him @nepenthez
[2022-12-23 19:43:50] <BernaLeoMessi> gotta spend that on something though
[2022-12-23 19:43:50] <%+riff_hunter44> Its not the way I look at it though
[2022-12-23 19:43:58] <deziixixv> Rivals x WL isnt free
[2022-12-23 19:43:58] <humanage> but I get your point
[2022-12-23 19:44:00] <hecriva> You‚Äôre judging a book by its cover
[2022-12-23 19:44:03] <m4nny1403> @nepenthez tonali is free and he is so clear
[2022-12-23 19:44:05] VIEWERS: 3¬†197
[2022-12-23 19:44:12] <+atxmix> yeah saying fodder is free is so stupid lmao, cus then youll have to pay x amount extra for the next sbc for the fodder u used
[2022-12-23 19:44:33] <%+olrichie> Always cost something because you may use all your fodder and then a great card comes out. So now your buying fodder
[2022-12-23 19:44:36] <+jsarrami> fodder is easy to come by, I don't even use FIFA points, done Ronaldo, showdowns etc and rarely buy fodder of transfer market, might be one of the lucky ones though
[2022-12-23 19:44:37] <the_real_mark_henry> There's nothing to put my fodder in because they didn't give us a good new icon
[2022-12-23 19:44:40] <xRamiresx> pato is crap, horrible stamina and dribbling
[2022-12-23 19:44:46] <QueenHeartie> yep i packed duplicate from champs so i did him no other reason to do him @nepenthez
[2022-12-23 19:44:50] <grantmc23> wtf i just lost my draft because i scored too many own goals
[2022-12-23 19:44:57] <m4nny1403> Zenetti is probs better
[2022-12-23 19:44:58] <+FoNts___> Guarantee de paul is so much better ig
[2022-12-23 19:44:58] <%Da_kapo> Verde with a finisher is a really good card
[2022-12-23 19:45:00] <%+DirtyDishFC> Robertone
[2022-12-23 19:45:10] <%+markcheesyy> di Maria was one 83 squad more than De Paul
[2022-12-23 19:45:13] <%+ray_rockwood> Just think about how much cheaper these players would be if EA didn't make all these packs untradeable!
[2022-12-23 19:45:15] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> INSANE WINTER WILDCARDS PROMO + FREE HISTORY MAKERS!
[2022-12-23 19:45:17] <Pelle13579> You do have to use your fodder every ones in while tho, otherwise you will start getting those anoying dupes, which is a waste
[2022-12-23 19:45:18] <m4nny1403> Maybe zenetti
[2022-12-23 19:45:19] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> Happy with that?
[2022-12-23 19:45:25] <hxrrison_plays_fifa> De Paul is still better
[2022-12-23 19:45:26] <jaofrank24> Macalister
[2022-12-23 19:45:31] <%+portagoon> Do we know if the new history cards go up?
[2022-12-23 19:45:47] <+atxmix> nstead of argentina compare with other laliga
[2022-12-23 19:45:51] <DOOBTEN> You pay a premium for a card that is never going to be on the market, is that so odd at this point? We also get "ridicolous" players for cheap, and all we hear is "W from EA" - fair enough on both ends, each card to their own at the end of the day.
[2022-12-23 19:46:05] <%+Kieran96cfc> They'll always be better options on the market for cheaper with how dead the market is
[2022-12-23 19:46:05] <deziixixv> he needed to be butlands rating TOTY few weeks
[2022-12-23 19:46:05] VIEWERS: 2¬†851
[2022-12-23 19:46:06] <%+mateyboyyy> macherano cheaper aswell
[2022-12-23 19:46:09] <marc123412341234> Prem st for 400k or under
[2022-12-23 19:46:13] <linus_teo> compare with wc goretzka
[2022-12-23 19:46:16] <+ashtonhall99> Chat do we know how many winwild tokens are coming out
[2022-12-23 19:46:16] <jhub3000> plus de paul has a generic face which makes him even more worthless
[2022-12-23 19:46:17] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> wow, prices have rocketed
[2022-12-23 19:46:19] <+grem1983> he worth it if you need him
[2022-12-23 19:46:22] <thengelbrown> compare to de jong
[2022-12-23 19:46:28] <xRamiresx> @DOOBTEN exactly
[2022-12-23 19:46:29] <+jsarrami> would you say 83 and 84 would be good price???
[2022-12-23 19:46:30] <+GansoGo> hes mid at best
[2022-12-23 19:46:31] <+atxmix> nep isnt it mental that a gullit gang card at 80k is too expensive, like i agree with u but the games changed so much over the last years
[2022-12-23 19:46:32] <+TheGreenePotato> some of these comments are hilarious LUL
[2022-12-23 19:46:38] <%Creativename_> I agree, the Robertone comparison is better. Comparing to Enzo, Paredes etc who you can't get is a bit tricky
[2022-12-23 19:46:41] <+afcmattinho> Don‚Äôt think there should really be a dilemma either v meh considering what‚Äôs available & how much he is
[2022-12-23 19:46:48] <+jsarrami> what would be a good price for you nep for this card?
[2022-12-23 19:46:51] <%+riff_hunter44> @atxmix Its free to me and Im afraid your stupid if you argue with that
[2022-12-23 19:46:56] <%+ace2ey> I don't think I would have done him if it weren't for the token
[2022-12-23 19:47:03] <+Harrison_9519> It's as simple as this, if you want to complete him then do, if not then don't. Merry Christmas Nep and chat
[2022-12-23 19:47:10] <+Metcalfe11> hes just a coin sink/ fodder sink. not a bad player and not stupidly priced but hes a card youll enjoy for 2-4 weeks then there will be better players and kinda wish you didnt do
[2022-12-23 19:47:10] <veedee08> show me the money, between France and Argentina links
[2022-12-23 19:47:16] <%ntblue1034> honest to god he's going to be behind the power curve in a month and you can't get rid
[2022-12-23 19:47:16] <%blazer33x> are these winter cards better then icons or fut heroes?
[2022-12-23 19:47:19] <+atxmix> @atxmix what? fodder literally isnt free, nep just explained this lmao
[2022-12-23 19:47:20] <+Jhaytch1> Is there 7pm content lads??
[2022-12-23 19:47:21] <+madforlan> you did Nick pope Nepp?now you got butland which is ***s the same what you say now

[2022-12-23 19:47:37] <lowkey_cole> Minus the traceable packs back? 70k???
[2022-12-23 19:47:39] <%+rishray> why do people in chat get riled up about others opinions, if you want to do it then do it nobody‚Äôs telling you not to
[2022-12-23 19:47:43] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> Butland doubled in price, verde up massively, klost up massively
[2022-12-23 19:47:44] <+1predz> what price do u think kante will settle as
[2022-12-23 19:47:47] <xlibbyx11> Does anyone know how to do the mystery objective
[2022-12-23 19:47:48] <Mazzah___> De Paul has the same card as Marchisio
[2022-12-23 19:47:49] <%+markcheesyy> di Maria was one 83 squad more expensive
[2022-12-23 19:47:51] <+atxmix> @rishray  whos getting riled?
[2022-12-23 19:47:57] <+Harrison_9519> @andreww3104 I don't get the back and forth, just pointless
[2022-12-23 19:47:58] <+hassan_rm> Is Ea extremely slow for anybody else?
[2022-12-23 19:48:00] <+madforlan> You did Nick Pope ok?butland is cheaper
[2022-12-23 19:48:02] <%exclusive457> wonder why EA dont release an loan version of the sbc player with the actual player?
