[2023-01-09 18:08:06] <+sighlentshots> @tsm_viss have you ever tried winning a mini trio by yourself?
[2023-01-09 18:08:22] <%+Moe25531> They don’t want to too have 150 wins
[2023-01-09 18:08:23] <%PrinceHumperdinck> There is a website to appeal a ban, and it basically shows you if you are or not.
[2023-01-09 18:08:25] <+sighlentshots> it is pretty fun
[2023-01-09 18:08:44] <%PrinceHumperdinck> @ron_again88 dizzyHey What is up today my human person!
[2023-01-09 18:08:44] <%RealityOGX> Viss how much do you really think operator choice matters, the frequency of warzone streamers to go with the sleek operator skin seems overkill wyt?
[2023-01-09 18:09:02] <%Lukienfin> I really wish I liked this game lol. Apex is dead to me, but just can't seem to get into this for some reason.
[2023-01-09 18:09:04] <%+nexusxxiii> sir there's a 149 win limit

[2023-01-09 18:11:44] <%RealityOGX> @Lukienfin well youre coming from apex which arguably has the best/most well developed movement of any BR. hard to go back after that but just have to get the fluidity down (i.e. no slide canceling anymore, etc.) TTK can be rough i hear that too, feels like i die instantly but takes forever to down peeps, lot of that had to do with the guns i was using, best of luck

[2023-01-09 18:30:43] <%RedShadowHTX> @mangowizards if you only have WZ2 and not regular Multiplayer MW2 it will take a bit leveling your weapons too to create custom loadouts. Just stick with it,
