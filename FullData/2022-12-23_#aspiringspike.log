[2022-12-23 16:47:28] <%aghi16> @aspiringspike it's because the first dungeons were made for standard
[2022-12-23 16:47:28] <%+andykv> it's tied to initiative which is a different mechanic
[2022-12-23 16:47:28] <+middeterminist> Under its was designed for commander

[2022-12-23 16:47:39] <+rasius_aj> imo they intentionally tuned the first dungeons to be pretty weak. Undercity was toned up
[2022-12-23 16:47:42] <%Claudiohmtg> dungeons were limited power lvl

[2022-12-23 16:49:10] <+rasius_aj> Undercity also was able to be pushed because it went straight to 'eternal' formats and not standard

[2022-12-23 16:54:32] <+benitar_oxford> This is a weird, noobish question for chat, but can the Undercity itself be banned in legacy formats? Not exactly sure how banning or how taking the initiative works tbh. Can you go into the other dungeons when you take the initiative?

[2022-12-23 17:01:04] <@%^MTGBot> The Oops All Spells deck uses MDFC Spell-Lands. Then they use Balustrade Spy or Undercity Informer to mill whole deck. They mill 4 Creeping Chills for 12 damage. Then they return 4 copies of Sword of the Meek by milling Narcomoeba, return Salvage Titan to hand by exiling 3 artifacts from the yard, then sacrifice 3 Swords of the Meek to cast Salvage Titan, which triggers the 4 Vengevines in the yard. Vines attack for 16, finishing you off after the Chills drained you for 12.

[2022-12-23 18:06:07] <rowrow_> @LapsywithTwitch in cedh I'd say it's tricky. You have the best tutors in the game, but no card advantage in the command zone
[2022-12-23 18:06:15] <%+eu_gandalf> ask them to concede in Esperanto, maybe it'll work

[2022-12-23 18:06:35] <rowrow_> @LapsywithTwitch but in cedh I'd say almost anything is viable
[2022-12-23 18:06:36] <deamzer> a misclick of going to the wrong dungeon locks you out tho

[2022-12-23 18:10:12] <%Bambino430> I thought it was correct to scam Fury over Grief
[2022-12-23 18:10:44] <rowrow_> grief is a 3 for 2, that can usually then use fury to clear the next wave of cards (creatures)
[2022-12-23 18:10:49] <+mattmanw2> You should just pick the initiative when you play acererak. Much quicker.
[2022-12-23 18:10:54] <+LapsywithTwitch> Is this a pretty good combo? I’m considering brewing around with in cEDH and I’m curious how it feels

[2022-12-23 18:28:42] <rowrow_> @SlL0e it dilutes the cards that get you closer to winning, not a lot of cuts you can make that aren't already interaction points

[2022-12-23 18:41:18] <elvesthe3rd> Does splashing into green or red for acceleration actually speed you up? Or just make the consistency worse?

[2022-12-23 18:50:57] <%iceman012> I'll admit, seeing this deck has made me interested in building an Acererak EDH deck.
[2022-12-23 18:51:12] <+Edac_plays> Sorry if this question has been asked a bunch what’s with the Orvar in the side for?
[2022-12-23 18:51:23] <rowrow_> the fact that acerarak can navigate mad mage on turn 4 on curve is... phenomenal
[2022-12-23 18:51:29] <+WhyeHD> Wow

[2022-12-23 18:51:30] <@%^MTGBot> Orvar is for the Archon of Cruelty decks. When the opposing Archon enters the battlefield, you discard Orvar to it, it enters as a copy of Archon, and they have to sac their Archon to your trigger.
[2022-12-23 18:51:35] <rowrow_> turn 2 heartless, turn 3 made mage 3 times, mad mage 4 times, win

[2022-12-23 19:13:01] <+Polivyus> Isn't Flash's reminder text "You may cast this any time you could cast an instant", so it would become a circular "you may cast this any time you may cast a sorcery with flash, which you may cast any time..."
[2022-12-23 19:13:06] <BigMoneyCrab> i believe Maro said if they could go back and do it all against Instant would be a subtype of Sorcery so functional a Sorcery with Flash
[2022-12-23 19:13:07] <%jpfeinberg> I feel like changing tribal to a super type is a small and easy change for wotc, but instant to sorcery with flash is too massive a change

[2022-12-23 19:18:58] <rowrow_> if you do tomb, you can't win

[2022-12-23 19:19:09] <%ghost111157> Sprite Dragon is cooler imo

[2022-12-23 19:20:11] <%+seeker509> I've played like 10 games with TPI prowess? I know its a small sample size but I think dragon feels better. I think the deck is just better positioned now with 4c gone

[2022-12-23 19:21:25] <nick_spears> This deck can’t combo if your library is smaller than ops life total, right?
[2022-12-23 19:21:30] <%+seeker509> I think sprite dragon is specifically better against bolt. and bolt decks are on the rise as well

[2022-12-23 19:22:17] <+1MrLeE> why not take bolt?
[2022-12-23 19:22:17] <%Bfitz88> @aspiringspike is this deck "big mana" enough to play a couple of rooftop storm?
[2022-12-23 19:22:21] <+brusselssproutswarm> do you ever complete the tomb of anihalation?
[2022-12-23 19:22:22] <rowrow_> @nick_spears depends by how much. you can deal an extra 1-3 damage if they have no cards in hand by doing the first two of Tomb
[2022-12-23 19:22:34] <@%Marvoleath> @seeker509 it depends though, if you t3 dragon into a spell and they bolt it, with iconoclast you still have a body

[2022-12-23 19:54:45] <BigMoneyCrab> Modern was so far disconnected from Standard that the only way to put "Standard" cards into Modern was to make them really over powered for Standard so they needed another avenue to put cards into Modern. Pioneer is not that far from Standard, it doesn't need another avenue for cards to enter.

[2022-12-23 19:56:38] <%+SolemnMTG> @LiminaIPraxis Because most of the cards you want to add to Pioneer could just be added through standard. Just let it naturally evolve instead
[2022-12-23 19:56:41] <@%Marvoleath> @hateindustry based on data from modern challenges etc, with top 10 modern popular cards only 2 of them are mh2

[2022-12-23 20:02:13] <@%Marvoleath> Modern should always be a format where you can take your 2014 Jund deck and go 3-2 in a league
[2022-12-23 20:02:13] <LiminaIPraxis> @trans1uc3nt Thats basically what LGS paper magic is LUL
[2022-12-23 20:02:16] <%+nicol_b> My take, which I thought was a hot one, is that pioneer should always have been a type of "extended" format with the last 4-5 years of sets to prevent power creep and make easier barrier of entry. I guess since TAndy literally just created that at least one person out there agrees with me and the take wasn't that hot

[2022-12-23 20:03:12] <%+mxawng> i agree with spike that modern was broken for many years in a row and is less broken now. unlike spike, i don't like MH2 in particular bc of how many old staples it pushed out of the format. i would have preferred to... i guess wait it out, which is what i did for years

[2022-12-23 20:15:14] <%+mxawng> the more i think about it, the more i come to terms with modern, to me, being a format where bolt, snap, and goyf are good important staples, which obviously has not been the case for like 7 years

[2022-12-23 20:15:37] <@%Marvoleath> @Bdell0vibri0 the dino was only reducing dinos though, I think

[2022-12-23 20:17:04] <+Bdell0vibri0> which is why it dealt damage to incoming creatures instead of being like summoning (plus that makes more sense for a red card)

[2022-12-23 21:41:45] <rowrow_> it's so weird narset is so good but people aren't even running 4 of them in legacy
[2022-12-23 21:41:47] <rowrow_> MiniK
[2022-12-23 21:41:48] <Tectek> the no hit run is dead, you have to reset
[2022-12-23 21:41:48] <Dragonbear1982> Are they better primarily because they are cheaper and have a similar impact on the board?
[2022-12-23 21:41:49] <%Bambino430> Expressive Iteration goes around Narset really well
[2022-12-23 21:41:55] <%DevilishGreg> I like the post combat sword.
[2022-12-23 21:41:56] <%$oshin1> opps deck is pretty solid

[2022-12-23 21:42:48] <+brusselssproutswarm> The fact that it's even a conversation says a lot
[2022-12-23 21:42:48] <TheTunnelingCat> oko being blue i think pushes it over
