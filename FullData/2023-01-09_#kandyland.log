[2023-01-09 10:27:03] <susanaeliasolraysioseum> If a program just randomly shuts down without warning and withouot any error messages, it is most likely due to resource issues

[2023-01-09 10:31:20] <@%MrMashalla> I got a new idea for the stream. Get a punching bag and hang it up in the room and start punching it for 10 minutes every time shit happens and you need to vent. @Kandyland
[2023-01-09 10:31:31] <Milad_96> probably your internet, i mean someone should put right diagnose

[2023-01-09 10:32:06] <%SAXEL34> Its so weird in english. En norsk reset är när man drar ur något ut väggen som fortfarande är på. Om du fattar hur jag menar. Så i detta fall dra ur strömkabeln till datorn, ur väggen, medans datorn är på. Kolla dock så att inte datorn gör nåt viktigt. Sen pluggar in den i väggen igen och sen låter datorn starta upp och se om det är bättre. aldrig behövt göra de på datorn men funkat med andra saker jag haft.

[2023-01-09 14:34:24] <%SAXEL34> Dont judge a car by its mile and amount of owners. Can be a super nice car. 7k mil is not much. 7k in 3-4 years is between 1500-2000 miles a year. That normal if the owners have used it for "Pendling". Talk to them, test drive and then think. Your the one spending money so you they can demand anything. Im sure it will be GREAT!
