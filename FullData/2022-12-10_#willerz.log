[2022-12-10 21:37:38] <+imLelly> @blackandchill run a practice with your friend, stand in the control room and learn the sounds while he runs around the perimeter. That's truly the best way to learn D2, next step is learning the peeks

[2022-12-10 21:53:26] <littlest0TTER> @gate_three nailed it
[2022-12-10 21:53:26] <+imLelly> @captaincresch There's a switch that you can pull near white pawn that spawns this alarm, it also spawns raiders at the K buildings (long buildings near hermatic door), additionally, while the alarm is sounding, any PMC can extract via the hermatic door extract. Once the alarm goes away, you no longer can until someone pulls the power switch again
[2022-12-10 21:53:31] <bazingaBalls> @captaincresch it turns on power for an extraction and it is super loud. hence raid is ruined. last about 4 minutes
[2022-12-10 21:53:32] <%+oldmanhandsss> OMG the alarm

[2022-12-10 21:56:19] <%TSvassilev> @loosy_goosy1 air raid alarms (and such) are very loud and are transmitted to many loudspeakers
[2022-12-10 21:56:19] <%+brys_on_pc> @loosy_goosy1 think it plays in multiple places
[2022-12-10 21:56:19] <bazingaBalls> willerz do you know why dehydration kills you through max metabolism when you have black head/torso?
[2022-12-10 21:56:23] <%+Jason1ZA> @engegangster He drops it in the end, so u get it back from insurance.

[2022-12-10 22:47:50] <+obiwanlegacy> @captf1shyf1nger asking how much money somebody makes, no matter what they do for a living, is rude

[2022-12-10 22:48:45] <%+captf1shyf1nger> @obiwanlegacy its not rude, sometimes it is a pertinent question. asking someone you dont know, is maybe a little aggressive, but not rude.
[2022-12-10 22:48:46] <%TakticalPickles> i just wish i could know big streamers CPM and monthly impressions :\
[2022-12-10 22:48:47] <%arodgg> Still tho someone wouldn’t go to a job interview and ask what they interviewer makes

[2022-12-10 22:51:02] <vnyeee> if someoen asked someone who worked at mcdonalds how much they made a year and they said 7 thousand dollars ppl would think down on them because they make less or more than u
[2022-12-10 22:51:07] <@%+iwiber> Sharing a middle wage yearly salary is not the same as sharing super low and super high
[2022-12-10 22:51:08] <%The9inWhiteBoy_YT> smfh kids
[2022-12-10 22:51:08] <%+hirtchu> i think its funny that corporate america has brainwashed people into thinking its taboo to know what another person makes for salary
[2022-12-10 22:51:08] <%$Godzillian> if you care that much you can easily work out a ball park figure with youtube views and top donors. you dont have to get the streamer to announce it themselves on stream officially
[2022-12-10 22:51:10] <teechair> alright, everyone in chat submit your tax returns to will
[2022-12-10 22:51:11] <+jordan45453> Willerz a public servant. I demand to know his salary.
[2022-12-10 22:51:15] <+obiwanlegacy> thats the same as telling a cop when he pulls you over that you pay his salary hahah

[2022-12-10 22:54:04] <thoclidias> someone mentioned that the date of the wipe is based on the answer to nikitas question in his tweet
[2022-12-10 22:54:07] <%soundskape> the curiosity is always gonna be there, but you're never obligated to discuss or disclose it
[2022-12-10 22:54:07] <+jordan45453> You are right.
[2022-12-10 22:54:11] <%+alpacacheese> respect the answer
[2022-12-10 22:54:12] <%toxic_munchkin84> WHO CARES , YOUR A ENTERTAINER
[2022-12-10 22:54:16] <+captain_chronicz> then the 16th?
[2022-12-10 22:54:16] <%nog00d4u> agreed 100%
[2022-12-10 22:54:17] <Butic> also get clipped
[2022-12-10 22:54:17] <%Sickhowl> yeah, I don't think they're doing a x-mas event pre-wipe this year, but it's weird that we don't have a REAL pre-wipe event
[2022-12-10 22:54:22] <+obiwanlegacy> its like asking what he likes to do in the bedroom lol
[2022-12-10 22:54:22] <+jordan45453> Bitches, do in fact, be tripping. And will get jealous and spiteful.
[2022-12-10 22:54:22] <%$Godzillian> He's saying he earns a lot lol
[2022-12-10 22:54:28] <+jordan45453> RESPECT HIS PRIVACY
[2022-12-10 22:54:29] <%+oconnor1795> im going to guess about $2s... yearly
[2022-12-10 22:54:29] <Butic> guy thinks hes talking to his buddies at a bar
[2022-12-10 22:54:41] <%impactblu_> when viewers find out , they become envious and they change how they see the streamer most of the time
[2022-12-10 22:54:42] <%jambon_to_fakie36> its not a very good example but if street artist had a recount of all tips they got ppl would absolutely stop giving away
[2022-12-10 22:54:43] <+captain_chronicz> we had our pre wipe events guys
[2022-12-10 22:54:43] <%+I7IUNTER> absolutely its personal I'd never ask anyone how much they make, but really im just curious KEKW jkjk
[2022-12-10 22:54:47] <vnyeee> not a single soul in sight
[2022-12-10 22:54:47] <%soundskape> hes comfortable and that's what we are all here supporting him for
[2022-12-10 22:54:49] <+captain_chronicz> it just wasn't announced
[2022-12-10 22:54:57] <%nog00d4u> my best friends IRL have no idea how much I make a year

[2022-12-10 22:55:18] <KingMetacomet> there's a ton of information out there that can give you an idea of what streamers are making
[2022-12-10 22:55:20] <%smoke802x> @oggie02 why are you in the same  profession because im more then happ to talk about my pay because equal pay across the board is important

[2022-12-10 22:55:23] <+the_big_grimy> besides, it fluctuates so much based on ad rev, sponsors, bits, affiliate vs partner. tournaments,...
