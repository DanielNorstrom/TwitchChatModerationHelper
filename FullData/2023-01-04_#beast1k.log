[2023-01-04 14:13:50] <+sgtbloodelf> @Redvid1  Just not a fan of big groups ganking solo / small groups. I indulge it don't get me wrong, but I really like even fights, and challenges. There's a ton of improvements on it, but would and continue to want better scenarios for PVP not constantly ZVZ / big groups hunting people down. And you can say hellgates-but I mean like open world. The chest n 'stuff do bring that sometimes, but its mainly big groups. Mist I've barely played but mostly seen tier 8 runners, so I dunnah.
[2023-01-04 14:14:10] VIEWERS: 4¬†975
[2023-01-04 14:14:23] <+sgtbloodelf> I liked hellgates and Corrupted cause of the Item level limit, but I prefer open world, since its more robust and unique to gameplay. Personal peeve though, it's in a good state vs 2 years ago.

[2023-01-04 14:16:22] <%Redvid1> @sgtbloodelf u say that but this game was designed and meant to play in groups and big fights the facts u have so much solo and smaller groups content nowadays is really good but open world should stay the same because thats why people play this game for years
