[2023-01-09 15:34:42] <OfficialPvlse> @Sp4zie the thing is shadowflame gives you flat pen, so it's better early game. VOid gives % pen so it's better as soon as they have a high amount of mr
[2023-01-09 15:34:45] <Honels> Shadowflame is like old morello FeelsOkayMan
[2023-01-09 15:34:48] <L4stKnown> I think its the same just opposite, like if shadowflame isn't enough, then buy void staff aswell
[2023-01-09 15:34:49] <+Keyah> Most champs that want to build a SF build it early

[2023-01-09 16:52:58] <Gopeto21> anything that came from a goat tastes like goat smell and is a no no for me
[2023-01-09 16:53:04] <%boostedharambe_> mizithra and feta are very different in texture
[2023-01-09 16:53:11] <%baterixSF> I understand dislike of blue cheese like Roquefort and Blue d'auvergne, it's quite bitter
[2023-01-09 16:53:15] <%boostedharambe_> flavor kinda similar
[2023-01-09 16:53:18] <elodriel> feta is godly in greece, very bad abroad

[2023-01-09 16:55:34] <@%MacYodaNL> aKsuaLLy wixeisNerd Feta is made of sheepsmilk and might contain goatsmilk as well, all depends on the manufacturer. Its part of the family of WHITE cheeses (yes that is a thing) together with beyaz peynir (Turkey), sirene (Bulgaria) and telemea (Rumenia).

[2023-01-09 18:08:06] <+Trecz> I could explain Akali's abilities but I'd hit the character limit before the passive was done

[2023-01-09 18:12:31] <+Yoshisaur> I hate Akali as Fizz and in general
[2023-01-09 18:12:33] <polduran> ask how her e works :D
[2023-01-09 18:12:35] <!Hypersugar> when she hits her E on something or inside her W cloud, she can dash to it
[2023-01-09 18:12:42] <!Hypersugar> she hit a minion
[2023-01-09 18:12:43] <wilzdilz> she can put her E on her smoke screen or a minions or you
[2023-01-09 18:12:43] <TheResistance13> she still suggs
[2023-01-09 18:12:44] <+Newtruss> SHE CAN HIT HER CLOUD WITH IT
[2023-01-09 18:12:46] <%Khamul__rw> she can E her smoke, and go to the smoke marked

[2023-01-09 18:12:55] <%Rincewurst> she puts a mark on units she hits with one of her blades and can jump to the marked unit. marked units have this manta ray thingy above them @Sp4zie
[2023-01-09 18:12:59] <$SilverNightwing> @sp4zie if her E hits her SMOKE SCREEN specifically she can dash back to it

[2023-01-09 18:14:09] <%Eagorath> if I recall correctly, she dashes with both her ultimate and with her shuriken spell (when it's out)
[2023-01-09 18:14:15] <wilzdilz> Her Shuriken can be placed on a smoke screen/minion/champion. Then she can dash back

[2023-01-09 18:15:05] <%Sintherioo> Thing you're getting hit by the most is the Q which yea, goes through minions and after the ability she has a stronger auto attack as well
