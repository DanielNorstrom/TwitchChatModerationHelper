[2023-01-11 07:09:29] <%Taylor131313> actually horrendous, best upgrade I can take is +7 ilvl
[2023-01-11 07:18:04] <%OJ_Hype> better than picking the currency LuL
[2023-01-11 07:39:46] <%Taylor131313> I'll just not pick anything for the moment and see if I can cheat myself a good +20 forsenCD
[2023-01-11 08:22:18] <%itsClubby> 421 tier in my vault its just too easy
[2023-01-11 08:22:30] <%Wardrick7> Smadge
[2023-01-11 08:22:37] <%Wardrick7> how is it possible to get the same trinket 3 weeks in a row in the same slot...

[2023-01-11 08:25:25] <%Wardrick7> trash vault 4 weeks in a row, weapons, m+ slots 415 neck same trash 411 trinket and 411 cloak
[2023-01-11 08:25:34] <%Wardrick7> no weapons*
[2023-01-11 08:25:56] <%Geoffku> anniesSole
[2023-01-11 08:28:43] <%Geoffku> time for my vault peepoOkay
[2023-01-11 08:29:41] <%Geoffku> Hmmm 408 bis chest or 411 bis grieftorch trinket
[2023-01-11 08:31:06] <%Geoffku> my m+ slots are dogshit this week Sadge
[2023-01-11 08:31:19] <%Wardrick7> this game hates me, got 16 AV SadgeCry
[2023-01-11 08:31:32] <%Geoffku> oof
[2023-01-11 08:31:57] <%Wardrick7> i never got a sbg or cos key always some trash key
[2023-01-11 08:41:48] <%Taylor131313> my vault was also ass
[2023-01-11 08:42:02] <%Taylor131313> trying to see if the method to cheat out keys works though xdd
[2023-01-11 09:01:21] <%Taylor131313> it fucking works xdd
[2023-01-11 09:02:19] <%Wardrick7> you did a 20? or just any key works?
[2023-01-11 09:02:31] <%Taylor131313> no, so here's the deal
[2023-01-11 09:02:50] <%Taylor131313> if you don't pick your vault yet, you will get a key of the level you're supposed to be from the first m+ you fo
[2023-01-11 09:02:59] <%Taylor131313> so in my case, a 20
[2023-01-11 09:03:13] <%Taylor131313> but if you turn auto loot off, you can see what it is and not pick it up if it's garbage
[2023-01-11 09:03:38] <%Taylor131313> so you can run another key and retry until you get a good one xddgarlic
[2023-01-11 09:03:43] <%Wardrick7> 5Head
[2023-01-11 09:03:48] <%Wardrick7> should have done the same SadgeCry
[2023-01-11 09:03:58] <%Taylor131313> my first one was RLP so I left it there like the piece of trash it is xddgarlic
[2023-01-11 09:04:09] <%Taylor131313> second one was a nokhud so it's proven to work
[2023-01-11 09:04:56] <%Taylor131313> still left it there cuz I want SBG or CoS xdd
[2023-01-11 09:36:48] <%Taylor131313> CoS 20, I'm happy with that YEP
[2023-01-11 09:45:53] <%+Alastor7783> happy vault day, chat
[2023-01-11 09:46:13] <%Taylor131313> that was not happy anniesMadgeClap
[2023-01-11 09:46:27] <%Makkan780> best option gave me 50 dps
[2023-01-11 09:46:37] <%Taylor131313> have you picked already makkan
[2023-01-11 09:46:39] <%Taylor131313> if not wait
[2023-01-11 09:46:39] <%Makkan780> not a single good vault in DG so far
[2023-01-11 09:46:54] <%Makkan780> will jsut pick sockets
[2023-01-11 09:47:02] <%Makkan780> everything is shit
[2023-01-11 09:47:02] <%Taylor131313> wait
[2023-01-11 09:47:04] <%Makkan780> no
[2023-01-11 09:47:08] <%Taylor131313> you can abuse this to get the key you want
[2023-01-11 09:47:12] <%Taylor131313> instead of random ass key from vault
[2023-01-11 09:47:28] <%Makkan780> how=
[2023-01-11 09:47:30] <%+Alastor7783> Susge
[2023-01-11 09:47:36] <%Taylor131313> turn auto loot off, run any key
[2023-01-11 09:47:51] <%Taylor131313> see chest, if the key is good pick it up, if not leave it there and run another key
[2023-01-11 09:48:30] <%Makkan780> ok
[2023-01-11 09:48:32] <%Taylor131313> remember to turn auto loot off or you won't have the chance to leave it there
[2023-01-11 09:48:51] <%Taylor131313> I went RLP -> NO -> CoS that way xdd
[2023-01-11 09:49:13] <%Makkan780> not sure if i really care
[2023-01-11 09:49:27] <%Makkan780> so tired of this shit rng
[2023-01-11 09:56:02] <%Wardrick7> i dont get it why they didnt try to add s4 upgrade or dinar system into vault, just let us use vault coins to pick an item or at least pick a slot

[2023-01-11 12:45:36] <%+Alastor7783> I'd get the pvp robe
[2023-01-11 12:45:58] <%Taylor131313> it's a lot of valor to upgrade to 415, hurts when you're still very capped
