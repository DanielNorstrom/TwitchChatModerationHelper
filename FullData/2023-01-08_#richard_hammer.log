[2023-01-08 06:08:03] <%AnxietyPrime> too old for drugs, and I did have a girl dancing up all on me but also she had a bf and got very upset when I asked if she was looking for a threesome or what
[2023-01-08 06:08:31] <%$Rararawr> was he looking for a twosome?

[2023-01-08 06:09:18] <%AnxietyPrime> idk I think my stripper dancing gave the impression I was gay so she was dancing with me because it was "safe" if that makes sense
[2023-01-08 06:09:35] <%$Rararawr> you're never too old for drugs. old people love hallucinogens'
[2023-01-08 06:10:26] <%$Rararawr> is dancing with her boyfriend not safer? thats still odd logic

[2023-01-08 09:54:36] <derivative12> ah
[2023-01-08 09:55:34] <derivative12> as long as nobodies around though, who's gonna know
[2023-01-08 09:55:36] <%+Salerodis> and if you catch something else by accident they gotsta go back
[2023-01-08 09:55:46] <%h4rdcorenub> I am a pro cast netter
[2023-01-08 09:55:52] <%+Salerodis> fishing kinda works on an honor system unless you get checked by a ranger
[2023-01-08 09:55:57] VIEWERS: 379
[2023-01-08 09:56:10] <%BrackMadar> is cast netting the thing where you grab a net, fan it on your arms and then toss it as it spreads to hit the water?
[2023-01-08 09:56:29] <%h4rdcorenub> throw cast nets from a kayak while seated is kinda hard. I used to do that
[2023-01-08 09:56:47] <%BrackMadar> I actually know how to do that, its tiring as a mother fucker after a while
[2023-01-08 09:57:00] <%TheOriginalFelord> I got pretty good at throwing em we used to fuck around with em trying to catch my buddies dog back in the day
[2023-01-08 09:57:05] <%BrackMadar> the trick to get it to open is quite easy actually, its all on the spreading on the arms
[2023-01-08 09:57:15] <%BrackMadar> and then just a swing and hips
[2023-01-08 09:57:24] <%h4rdcorenub> 8ft net is MUCH easier than like 12ft
[2023-01-08 09:57:36] <+rkt227> that's just math
[2023-01-08 09:57:57] VIEWERS: 379
[2023-01-08 09:58:23] <derivative12> I think it's all in the spin
[2023-01-08 09:58:33] <%BrackMadar> they are probably spreading it wrong, i havent done that in more than a decade at this point i think, but it was all on the spin and how you hold it
[2023-01-08 09:58:33] <%h4rdcorenub> we used to always have to catch our mullet, croakers, or shrimp before we went fishing
[2023-01-08 09:58:43] <%h4rdcorenub> so I got a lot of preactice growing up
[2023-01-08 09:58:46] <%+Salerodis> riding a bike is quite easy for someone who has learned and figured it out
[2023-01-08 09:58:51] <%BrackMadar> like, do they put the excess net behind their elbow? i think i remember that being most of the trick
[2023-01-08 09:59:41] <%BrackMadar> i could get it to spread open, i just never got the reach my shitty dad had, that mother fucker could just toss the net like 4 meters in front of him
[2023-01-08 09:59:57] <e_v_r_> would it be unsporting to use something like a t-shirt cannon to launch it?
[2023-01-08 09:59:57] VIEWERS: 357
[2023-01-08 09:59:59] <%BrackMadar> like just toss it all the way he wanted kind of far
[2023-01-08 10:00:08] <derivative12> fish can't see in the dark so probably not much bites now
[2023-01-08 10:00:59] <%BrackMadar> come to mexico rich, we can go cast some nets and teach you all the secrets rich1 rich2
