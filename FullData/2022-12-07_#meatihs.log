[2022-12-07 17:38:49] <leonardompad> If you are f2p that pretty much true
[2022-12-07 17:38:50] <%Zounderkite_> xdd
[2022-12-07 17:38:52] <+zMuffinMan> its because meat has a gambler's brain, the frost DK deck ran out of juice and he needed to switch machines (i mean decks)
[2022-12-07 17:38:59] <@%+DanTheGreat94> ;)
[2022-12-07 17:39:03] <jpalermo> I think the more informative answer is he lost a few in a row and wanted to try something else…

[2022-12-07 17:46:10] <evil_troy> just seems good because druid is so slow and don't do anything right?
[2022-12-07 17:46:10] <+RoboClam> does feno ever whisper lovingly into your ear
[2022-12-07 17:46:10] <grippppe> Hey MeatiHS should I craft that hunter deck XDDD
[2022-12-07 17:46:10] <%MercenaryQ> hunter is always good at the start of an expansion because it prays on unrefined decks
[2022-12-07 17:46:10] <+TheSmokeSniper> its definetly good maybe not tier1 but quite strong
[2022-12-07 17:46:10] <leonardompad> hunter stats shows otherwise
[2022-12-07 17:46:11] <Vengeance_88> Lost to a tier 3 meme deck LUL
[2022-12-07 17:46:14] <@%+DanTheGreat94> tony has a point
[2022-12-07 17:46:18] <+zMuffinMan> 3 losses tho... let's ignore the sample size
[2022-12-07 17:46:20] <helmetwearer> @MeatiHS you mean lists running brewmaster are meme decks?
[2022-12-07 17:46:26] <+Zeggix> It somehow killed me from 37 on turn 9, thought i was save
[2022-12-07 17:46:28] <ShatteredTV> yes obviously
[2022-12-07 17:46:29] <%qmTeemu> It's one of the highest winrate decks atm at 57%
[2022-12-07 17:46:31] <Piplupper> yes
[2022-12-07 17:46:32] <Vengeance_88> But is it 1%
[2022-12-07 17:46:33] <BigBlueBottle> How do you get 1% wr?
[2022-12-07 17:46:33] <@%MightyKingPin> if it wins 3 times against you its for sure more than 1%
[2022-12-07 17:46:36] <Orzler> well the win rate isnt looking too bad on stat sites
[2022-12-07 17:46:37] <dereverse> how do you know its 1%?
[2022-12-07 17:46:42] <jonny720> Kanye west
[2022-12-07 17:46:44] <+TheSmokeSniper> that deck has like a 60% winrate probably
[2022-12-07 17:46:46] <%qmTeemu> It's 57% winrate
[2022-12-07 17:46:54] <+willbrisco> rank 20 legend 1% winrate
[2022-12-07 17:46:57] <+juulinnn> Oh hes salty lol
[2022-12-07 17:46:57] <dereverse> dude its 57% winrate
[2022-12-07 17:46:58] <+BoltharHS> Very salty about a bad tier 3 deck
[2022-12-07 17:46:58] <+Dtkaze> the chances of me seeing it win 1/100 times is pretty unlikely
[2022-12-07 17:46:58] <+zMuffinMan> he's gaslighting you chat
[2022-12-07 17:46:59] <Urkoth> YEP
[2022-12-07 17:46:59] <!ChopperTony> But it is highest winrate on hs replay yet. Its not a 1% winrate
[2022-12-07 17:47:01] <+tonioshelby> Twitch chat is a country
[2022-12-07 17:47:02] <+rlp_patrick> 1% make sense
[2022-12-07 17:47:07] <+quinode> imagine losing to a 1% winrate deck
[2022-12-07 17:47:07] <helmetwearer> won current game, must be the nuts Kappa
[2022-12-07 17:47:19] <toxicrain1719> Hi champ, are Tess deck still good after expansion??
[2022-12-07 17:47:22] <%+itsdatboyduddus> @MeatiHS if you're constantly losing to it, it must be good. We haven't seen you beat it once.
[2022-12-07 17:47:23] <+juulinnn> you play druid randy
[2022-12-07 17:47:27] <@UbererHS> vandicator drawing that buff is just ridiculous
[2022-12-07 17:47:27] <Orzler> opinion b will happen tomorrow and meatman will say it's a good deck Kappa
[2022-12-07 17:47:30] <+Zeggix> then 2% it is
[2022-12-07 17:47:39] <Vengeance_88> If it counters druid it looks good to me honestly

[2022-12-07 18:13:30] <+DeinXsichtv2> Yo man got a stupid kinda question. I haven’t played hs in years and started playing again couple of days ago. Hs offers me a free deck from the previous expansion. One of the decks contains most of the cards your playing right now. I’m wondering if I should take this one or a Druid deck with less legendaries but with some alignment cards that seem to be core in most Druid decks right now
