[2023-01-02 01:01:33] <MyNamesD1> Why is nobody grinding this season
[2023-01-02 01:01:42] <Bustacap007> Thanks!
[2023-01-02 01:01:47] <TmR_1999> there should be a badge/skin that you only get if you end the season top 5 pred or sumn
[2023-01-02 01:01:48] <MyNamesD1> Fuhnq and Zach are like the only ones
[2023-01-02 01:01:55] <@%jimmy_turtie> Food sounds so good
[2023-01-02 01:01:57] <@%jimmy_turtie> Right now
[2023-01-02 01:02:27] <MyNamesD1> I mean #1 needs it’s own badge at least
[2023-01-02 01:02:42] <MyNamesD1> Or even just a number beneath ur pred badge that says ur place
[2023-01-02 01:02:49] <TmR_1999> yea true #1 should get a bunch of unique stuff
[2023-01-02 01:02:52] <+Warma99> You are dropping to 100 fps very often
[2023-01-02 01:02:53] <Bustacap007> For sure. If they did that people would 100% grind more
[2023-01-02 01:02:58] <%FAnaite> there should be a number on the badge what rank you got at the end of the season
[2023-01-02 01:03:02] <TheBunbies> borderless window maybe??
[2023-01-02 01:03:05] <%FAnaite> would be cool
[2023-01-02 01:03:10] <MyNamesD1> Just the number beneath the pred badge would be an incentive
