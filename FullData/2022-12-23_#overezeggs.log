[2022-12-23 06:16:25] <!%$DarkRaigeFire> it's twitch
[2022-12-23 06:16:33] <%$nemafow> I think the game isnt very well optimised for Eggs setup
[2022-12-23 06:16:38] <!%$DarkRaigeFire> twitch is being terrible to a lot of people

[2022-12-23 06:17:01] <!%$DarkRaigeFire> no it's not the game, this has been happening to Egg and other people for a while now
[2022-12-23 06:17:11] <!%$DarkRaigeFire> it's just been getting worse the last few days
[2022-12-23 06:17:14] <%eksdra> a likely excuse
[2022-12-23 06:17:44] <%$nemafow> Usually when twitch dies/craps out for me the audio goes with it; the audio isnt crapping out for me in gtfo is all

[2022-12-23 08:51:59] <%Flamebunnyy> Hair has growth cycles so you have to zap if over a few sessions so you can catch each hair while its growing

[2022-12-23 08:52:42] <%Flamebunnyy> It heats up the melanin and kills the root
[2022-12-23 08:52:53] <%Flamebunnyy> hence it doesn't work well for light hair or darker skin unfotunately
[2022-12-23 08:52:56] <%haiddon> normally I don't care, it's just occasionally my hair just annoys me into taking action. no other part of my body does that

[2022-12-23 09:08:58] <%$nemafow> You'd need to learn to draw in the colours you intend to use wouldnt you?

[2022-12-23 09:11:45] <%vexingvoid> Sometimes you can make the lines a lighter color, and that helps, but it might just be a personal thing ;-;

[2022-12-23 09:41:42] <%$raven2dance> I was like that with elden ring. but I got sucked into it hard and got Plat in like 5 days.
[2022-12-23 09:41:56] <!%+operatorviera> yeah that looks very interesting
[2022-12-23 09:41:57] <%vexingvoid> I play Warzone DMZ because I can’t get a pc ;-; and that game mode is the closest thing I got to tarkov
[2022-12-23 09:42:18] <%WarwWolf91> yeah it looks good, it has that Bioshock feel
[2022-12-23 09:42:18] <!%+operatorviera> I really want Stalker to come out, but i understand it's delay
[2022-12-23 09:42:18] <what_ameme> Judas
