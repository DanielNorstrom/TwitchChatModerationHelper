[2022-12-19 09:01:43] <pulse21274> Hello @P4wnyhof How are you?
[2022-12-19 09:02:29] <%vkphoenixfr> I think if you work based on the viewer image reading time, the text should not be tilted, as it makes it slower to read. Viewer may read the "damage" text first, and may not go back left to read the rest
[2022-12-19 09:04:03] <SaltDisney> good day sir
[2022-12-19 09:05:05] <%LordOverflow> Or EBR14 could be part of weapon skin but yeah :D

[2022-12-19 10:11:20] <Xann_> The hit registration is actually really good in this game you just don't get any sort of assist.
[2022-12-19 10:11:40] <Xann_> So if you missed, you actually missed.

[2022-12-19 10:12:09] <Xann_> You can miss by moving AFTER you've swung your mace.
[2022-12-19 10:12:18] <%Bugacman> meanie lil 8legs :D

[2022-12-19 10:13:14] <Xann_> You have the spells that you spawn in with. You can get SOME charges back by using a campfire.
[2022-12-19 10:13:26] <+zeroduk3> yeah ot rly is and it is also realy hardcore
[2022-12-19 10:14:26] <Xann_> Shrines can only be used by 1 person they will full heal you though. Once the charge on the shrine is used its gone for everyone.

[2022-12-19 10:14:56] <Hi_im_Nath_Btw> gg adverts
[2022-12-19 10:15:02] <Xann_> yah unlucky
[2022-12-19 10:16:02] <Hi_im_Nath_Btw> one of these days these boots are gonna walk all over you
[2022-12-19 10:16:12] <Hi_im_Nath_Btw> use ur team mates head
[2022-12-19 10:16:50] <Xann_> You can get in there, there is a path. You can hit 3 to bring our your torches to throw them in places with no light. These can be picked up after.
[2022-12-19 10:17:01] <Xann_> Also yeh, its a BR. zone shrinks
[2022-12-19 10:18:44] <Xann_> You can, its weird. MAKE SURE you actually cast the spell completely before you move.
[2022-12-19 10:19:12] <Xann_> Holy Light work but it does 100 flat damage skels have more than 100 hp
[2022-12-19 10:19:28] <Xann_> Fighter is probably the best class to start with.
[2022-12-19 10:22:25] <%LordOverflow> It will probably bring some competition so it's good that they show the game this early
[2022-12-19 10:22:56] <%ITGuy_Gaming> So much noise :D
[2022-12-19 10:23:18] <Xann_> Barrels, Boxes and Urns can all contain loot. Loot on the ground is often VERY SMALL so be thorough.
[2022-12-19 10:23:46] <%Bugacman> raised the shield so slow... :D
[2022-12-19 10:23:52] <Xann_> Take his SOUL off his body
[2022-12-19 10:23:59] <+quzohr> take the soulstone
[2022-12-19 10:24:03] <%ITGuy_Gaming> Why do we need soulstone?
[2022-12-19 10:24:10] <Xann_> You can res him WITH his SOUL if you find a res station.

[2022-12-19 10:25:51] <%LordOverflow> is there archer?
[2022-12-19 10:25:55] <Xann_> Okay. Near the inner part of the map BLUE and GREY STONES will spawn. in either sets of 1 or 3. You need to channel to open the portal and then WALK through it.
[2022-12-19 10:26:04] <%Bugacman> massacre :D
[2022-12-19 10:26:28] <%ITGuy_Gaming> there is resurection spell :D
[2022-12-19 10:26:38] <Xann_> RED and GREY stones also spawn, they take you down to the next floor where a couple bosses are. At your level avoid these.
[2022-12-19 10:26:40] <SpiralEve> tip for the cleric, holy light big heal only heals others, the small heal you can heal yourself as well
[2022-12-19 10:26:42] <%LordOverflow> That lobby house looks interesting
[2022-12-19 10:26:48] <Xann_> If you block something, you block period.
[2022-12-19 10:27:03] <%+jthetibian> You are level 1 so probably you need to get levels to become stronger
[2022-12-19 10:27:29] <Xann_> You cannot block magic through, gotta dodge.
[2022-12-19 10:28:04] <%ITGuy_Gaming> and arrows?
[2022-12-19 10:28:11] <%$Felix_Mdft> what kind of game is this ?

[2022-12-19 10:28:53] <Xann_> Yes, you are SEVERLY undergeared. You will want to go very slow and focus on getting of the map a few times.
[2022-12-19 10:29:17] <SpiralEve> and yeah for blocking alot of overheads you must look up slightly to be effective
[2022-12-19 10:29:26] <SpiralEve> nice little baby rogue haha
[2022-12-19 10:29:30] <Xann_> Yeah, blocking is directional.
[2022-12-19 10:29:49] <+Rammy_101> the RP is real
[2022-12-19 10:30:28] <%LordOverflow> if you take enemy player soul, can you revive them? :D
[2022-12-19 10:30:33] <%+buenzel> can you collect the soul of the player?
[2022-12-19 10:31:18] <Xann_> Go inside that inner room, there are mobs in there but there's also 2-3 chests
[2022-12-19 10:31:35] <Dan_Shallow> Morning everyone, please keep me busy for the next few days! Life can be shitty sometimes!
[2022-12-19 10:31:37] <+quzohr> hahaha
[2022-12-19 10:31:42] <%ITGuy_Gaming> they waited on :D
[2022-12-19 10:31:42] <%LordOverflow> trap :D
[2022-12-19 10:32:05] <%Bugacman> we lvl2 :D
[2022-12-19 10:32:08] <%LordOverflow> well that was fun
[2022-12-19 10:32:15] <+quzohr> great game
[2022-12-19 10:32:16] <Xann_> Also @P4wnyhof sound is VERY VERY good in this game. Steps are very loud. Rangers can hear steps before other classes.
[2022-12-19 10:32:34] <TheRealRomulux> this game is sick, i just downloaded it
[2022-12-19 10:32:41] <%LordOverflow> it's like who cares about the AI enemies. it's all about killing other players
[2022-12-19 10:33:01] <Xann_> in your inventory
[2022-12-19 10:33:01] <%Redmiddle_mist> hello
[2022-12-19 10:33:02] <+quzohr> only problem with the game is the expected release date to be Q4 2023
[2022-12-19 10:33:08] <Xann_> but you didn't get out with any
[2022-12-19 10:33:10] <Xann_> so you have none
[2022-12-19 10:33:15] <%Redmiddle_mist> is this the game that has been popping off
[2022-12-19 10:33:58] <TheRealRomulux> @Redmiddle_mist yes, they're doing free playtesting on steam
[2022-12-19 10:35:11] <%Bugacman> okay so i can heal 50%, good to know :D
[2022-12-19 10:36:40] <%LordOverflow> playtest end 23.12
[2022-12-19 10:36:55] <+zeroduk3> do u need a 3rd party member?
[2022-12-19 10:37:30] <+quzohr> easy to learn, hard to master
[2022-12-19 10:38:11] <+zeroduk3> sure why not iit is at least better than to die alone
[2022-12-19 10:38:48] <%Redmiddle_mist> all this work for one guy
[2022-12-19 10:38:56] <SpiralEve> hes a mini boss actually
[2022-12-19 10:39:11] <+Nagwag> By his looks he died a loooong time ago :D
[2022-12-19 10:39:11] <%ITGuy_Gaming> hihihih
[2022-12-19 10:39:21] <%$Felix_Mdft> what was that ?
[2022-12-19 10:39:22] <%$Felix_Mdft> :/
[2022-12-19 10:39:27] <%Redmiddle_mist> out playes
[2022-12-19 10:39:30] <+cptstabbing> Even if it is the slightest headshot you'll get hit when you block
[2022-12-19 10:39:58] <+zeroduk3> he can take ur soul under the breastplate and try to revive u at the shrine with the white light
[2022-12-19 10:40:39] <SpiralEve> the reason is because he was side slashing you needed to look a bit left or right, directional

[2022-12-19 10:41:43] <%ITGuy_Gaming> jinxed him on "good block" hahah

[2022-12-19 10:41:58] <%Bugacman> timing is crucial... :)
[2022-12-19 10:42:10] <+dedlazer686> yeah when they overhead swing u gotta block higher cuz ur head is above a small shield, same with side swings, can't block right if sword coming from left
[2022-12-19 10:42:12] <%LordOverflow> at least socials works on this :D
[2022-12-19 10:42:20] <%LordOverflow> not like in MW2/WZ2
[2022-12-19 10:42:23] <+cptstabbing> The game needs a solo que and a automatic group up button.
[2022-12-19 10:42:33] <%Bugacman> lvl 8 legend!!
[2022-12-19 10:42:57] <Xann_> Solo Queue would be a godsend yeah.
[2022-12-19 10:43:00] <SpiralEve> in the first alpha shields were all pretty much 100% block, but i believe now some of the smaller shields sometimes the attacks just go through as well
[2022-12-19 10:43:11] <+cptstabbing> Also rangers :) they reign supreme. Hate them.
[2022-12-19 10:43:31] <+dedlazer686> game is rough in the start til u start getting some money to buy meds and gear
[2022-12-19 10:43:53] <+cptstabbing> Yeah once you get soem cash for pots and bandages.
[2022-12-19 10:44:19] <Xann_> That altar with the Light on it is your res station
[2022-12-19 10:44:34] <+dedlazer686> i recommend breaking boxes, barrels and pots cuz they usually got sellable stuff
[2022-12-19 10:44:59] <+cptstabbing> Don't you have some sort of extra damage vs undead as a cleric?
[2022-12-19 10:45:12] <+cptstabbing> I only played rouge and ranger.
[2022-12-19 10:45:18] <Xann_> @P4wnyhof Loot on the ground from Boxes, urns and barrels can often be VERY SMALL pay close attention when you break something and stare at the ground.
[2022-12-19 10:45:45] <greyfox1987> Damn this looks cool! So is it like BR Tarkov in dungeons or something?

[2022-12-19 10:45:57] <Xann_> @greyfox1987 yes, exactly
[2022-12-19 10:46:04] <+dedlazer686> p4wnyhof just casually ignoring all my tips :'( i crai :3
[2022-12-19 10:46:23] <+cptstabbing> Backpedaling is your best friend. :)
[2022-12-19 10:46:25] <%LordOverflow> don't forget the zone
[2022-12-19 10:46:31] <+dedlazer686> @LordOverflow i prefer playing solo :3

[2022-12-19 10:46:37] <greyfox1987> Awesome! Anyone know if it would run decently on 1080p with a Ryzen 5800X and a 1070? My pc is getting old :/
[2022-12-19 10:46:42] <%LordOverflow> @dedlazer686 same
[2022-12-19 10:47:04] <Xann_> yes grey it'll run fine.
[2022-12-19 10:47:11] <+dedlazer686> @greyfox1987 yeah no worries i run it on all highest graps with a 1080
[2022-12-19 10:47:22] <%LordOverflow> of course there's mimic :D
[2022-12-19 10:47:26] <%ITGuy_Gaming> there really is Mimic :D
[2022-12-19 10:47:27] <greyfox1987> Awesome! thx guys
[2022-12-19 10:48:32] <+dedlazer686> there is no value in saving gear for other classes since stash is individual for each character and they don't sell for that much
[2022-12-19 10:48:32] <+cptstabbing> @P4wnyhof Love your enthusiasm :) The little schreeches of joy when you find a chest. :)
[2022-12-19 10:49:13] <Xann_> get the SURGICAL KIT, BIG heal item
[2022-12-19 10:49:38] <+cptstabbing> You can throw the torch too, to light up areas.
[2022-12-19 10:50:01] <+dedlazer686> i love the fact that you didn't know that much about the game and went head in :P enjoying this content so much ! also keep up the great streams <3
[2022-12-19 10:50:35] <+dedlazer686> @P4wnyhof you can right click to loot btw
[2022-12-19 10:51:02] <+dedlazer686> yeah when looting chest or players you can right click
[2022-12-19 10:51:12] <Viceasrev> you can aoe purge undead by Q ability for 100 dmg
[2022-12-19 10:52:16] <+zeroduk3> okay didnt see him coming LUL
[2022-12-19 10:52:19] <%ITGuy_Gaming> Hold the fort :D
[2022-12-19 10:52:27] <Xann_> You gotta make him miss.
[2022-12-19 10:52:31] <%Bugacman> he attacked fast
[2022-12-19 10:52:35] <%+Realist_87> no stamina bar?
[2022-12-19 10:52:48] <+dedlazer686> side stepping is your best friend when turning the tide of who is attacking :P
[2022-12-19 10:52:50] <+zeroduk3> i was lotting Bugac soul to rez him LUL
[2022-12-19 10:52:52] <%LordOverflow> could've drank invisibility potion until he reached you :P
[2022-12-19 10:53:05] <%LordOverflow> but yeah who remembers such item
[2022-12-19 10:53:05] <%Bugacman> gotta go, maybe someone wants to join :)
[2022-12-19 10:53:33] <+cptstabbing> Wan't he decked out too. This game has no a shit matchmaking.
[2022-12-19 10:53:39] <+dedlazer686> they gonna add it in next playtest :P
[2022-12-19 10:53:44] <%$Bluubbaa> woop woop...how you guys doing ?
[2022-12-19 10:53:48] <Inchiuvatu> Sure ill just make character
[2022-12-19 10:54:12] <+dedlazer686> i would love to but I'm doing some work rn :3 lemme finnish this and I'll join ^^,
[2022-12-19 10:54:25] <%LordOverflow> probably the people who have good gear probably do the high ante runs
[2022-12-19 10:54:28] <Inchiuvatu> Nobbledoc
[2022-12-19 10:54:38] <Xann_> Its pretty hard to beat a geared player. They have access to more spells and do a LOT more damage. the base weapons for all the classes are really bad.
[2022-12-19 10:54:46] <+dedlazer686> people with good gear are the best ! free realstate !
[2022-12-19 10:55:04] <%LordOverflow> Guess high ante runs give better loot also
[2022-12-19 10:55:18] <+cptstabbing> unless you're a naked wizard with chain lightning :)
[2022-12-19 10:55:23] <+dedlazer686> high risk high reward
[2022-12-19 10:55:25] <+cptstabbing> You can do!

[2022-12-19 10:56:08] <%LordOverflow> floathing combat text or something. or just sound like in WZ that you know you hit something
[2022-12-19 10:56:16] <SpiralEve> @cptstabbing they did, and no more 3 man blue portals
[2022-12-19 10:56:38] <+cptstabbing> Hard enough to extract as it is :)
[2022-12-19 10:56:44] <SpiralEve> the pots have good chance for gems and potions
[2022-12-19 10:56:50] <+dedlazer686> i got 40h in this weekend :P 1st 20 runs are just for learning but after that you gonna be escaping alot ^^, after 40 runs ya gonna be trying to get the boss on last floor :3
[2022-12-19 10:56:53] <+cptstabbing> But I mainly solo
[2022-12-19 10:57:02] <%ITGuy_Gaming> that L9 rogue is not it. He does 20 stabs for nothing XD

[2022-12-19 10:58:45] <SpiralEve> yeah the weapons and armor really dont sell to well, you want to fill up inventory with gems mostly, just keep gear you want to use
[2022-12-19 10:59:42] <+cptstabbing> Because it is vintage armor, duh.

[2022-12-19 11:03:07] <+cptstabbing> Spiders are so hard to hit
[2022-12-19 11:03:33] <+zeroduk3> X to put ur weapon away and run faster
[2022-12-19 11:03:41] <Inchiuvatu> damned spider

[2022-12-19 11:05:00] <%LordOverflow> At least it's good for the genre to get such game and not just shooters
[2022-12-19 11:05:12] <%+x__jehuty__x> Good morning @P4wnyhof, good morning chat!
[2022-12-19 11:05:14] <+dedlazer686> the devs are actually listening to players =) the whole point of the playtest is so devs get info on what to change and not, what to add and remove :3
[2022-12-19 11:05:32] <im_warez> Hey Powny :) How u doing ? :D Greetz from Siegburg :)
[2022-12-19 11:05:52] <%LordOverflow> I tried to find any videos about that but didn't find any so you might want to make one if you go for it ;)
[2022-12-19 11:06:09] <+cptstabbing> yes
[2022-12-19 11:06:19] <Yoni_Gafni> Poooound Poooound
[2022-12-19 11:06:43] <+dedlazer686> skelly archers get 1 hit by the spell, melee skellys are 1 hit after spell :P
[2022-12-19 11:07:23] <+dedlazer686> mage has a light spell
[2022-12-19 11:07:26] <%ITGuy_Gaming> Heal?
[2022-12-19 11:07:31] <im_warez> So i guess this is a medieval Dungeon Crawler Tarkov ? :D Looks sick :D
[2022-12-19 11:07:44] <%LordOverflow> Wix is pretty popular from same kind of services but I personally hate any site that says it's powered with Wix :D
[2022-12-19 11:08:37] <TastieFlyer> you look like bigdawstv
[2022-12-19 11:08:53] <+dedlazer686> go in the middle and use spell
[2022-12-19 11:09:01] <+dedlazer686> will 1 hit everything :P
[2022-12-19 11:10:03] <%LordOverflow> is there in game text chat?
[2022-12-19 11:10:14] <+dedlazer686> only lobby chat
[2022-12-19 11:10:21] <%LordOverflow> shame

[2022-12-19 11:13:00] <%LordOverflow> that crouching animation :D
[2022-12-19 11:13:03] <+dedlazer686> blue portals start apearing after 3 minutes, the smaller the zone the more portals.  you can also see top right who dies from what and what portals appear

[2022-12-19 11:16:12] <SpiralEve> in class
[2022-12-19 11:16:22] <+dedlazer686> rushing trough rooms usually does not work :P so moving ahead of the zone is recommended :P
[2022-12-19 11:16:24] <+zeroduk3> u can take ur second passive
[2022-12-19 11:17:30] <Inchiuvatu> yeah voice chat would be useful! lol

[2022-12-19 11:31:36] <%xjoev> just feels like everything is a little too slow
[2022-12-19 11:31:44] <%ITGuy_Gaming> aa throw a torch! Smart play :D
[2022-12-19 11:32:04] <zaarags> hey pawn im sure you got asked already. What is your opinion on the nadia case? Or you dont want to talk about it? But i thought i ask. Was curious on your opinion

[2022-12-19 11:34:34] <%xjoev> @Dotrein right?! I would definitely increase the swing/action speed 2x
[2022-12-19 11:34:57] <%sirsweetpotato> @keyboardcowboy666 its in the lore hahahah
[2022-12-19 11:35:09] <%xjoev> maybe 1.5x just feels like I'm watching the oversized antman try and a swing a mace
[2022-12-19 11:35:52] <+dedlazer686> also always aim for head cuz it's more dmg :3

[2022-12-19 11:43:17] <+cptstabbing> Can you not sell purples and stuff to other players?
[2022-12-19 11:43:28] <SpiralEve> I reccomend buying some bandages or possibly a campfire
[2022-12-19 11:43:40] <+dedlazer686> @cptstabbing you can but no1 really trading now during playtest
[2022-12-19 11:44:08] <%LordOverflow> save the money until you can do high ante run :P
[2022-12-19 11:44:25] <+dedlazer686> i only got 26 candycanes in 40h of gameplay this weekend xD
[2022-12-19 11:45:36] <SpiralEve> i also havnt seen very many candy canes
[2022-12-19 11:47:04] <%qb4trolls> which one of you is Dark?
[2022-12-19 11:47:54] <%+berserkjaguar88> who are you playing with?
[2022-12-19 11:48:20] <%LordOverflow> My son always wants to test his new weapons on me in every game if possible

[2022-12-19 11:51:52] <Optimmuss> it brings me some 90.s vibes :D
[2022-12-19 11:53:13] <%$DonDLow> zombiefarts....hell nooo
[2022-12-19 11:55:31] <%SU_Shadow> TAG and P4wny, my favorite European streamers, playing together
[2022-12-19 11:57:29] <%xjoev> definitely a lot of refining to do before release
[2022-12-19 11:57:43] <SpiralEve> It costs health to rezz, so after the bat hit him he didnt have enough health to rezz
[2022-12-19 11:58:24] <%xjoev> not a great mechanic imo LUL
[2022-12-19 11:58:42] <SpiralEve> its like 10 or 15% but he was at like 1hp haha
[2022-12-19 11:58:46] <SpiralEve> that and 12 zombies lol
[2022-12-19 11:59:16] <%xjoev> definitely should play fable, I recently completed it for a 3rd time
[2022-12-19 11:59:20] <Barakabites> cool ebr video...
[2022-12-19 11:59:25] <%xjoev> fable 2 is also good but fable 3 is horrendous
[2022-12-19 11:59:34] <SpiralEve> i agree that fable is a great experience
[2022-12-19 12:00:14] <SpiralEve> Its magic missles, it never misses Kappa
[2022-12-19 12:00:26] <SpiralEve> but it definitely shouldnt have locked onto you after the skele died
[2022-12-19 12:00:51] <%LordOverflow> If you have great balls of fire, you use those!
[2022-12-19 12:01:12] <%SU_Shadow> there is nothing in the coffins, till there is
[2022-12-19 12:01:26] <+cptstabbing> There is a skeletal mage there
[2022-12-19 12:01:46] <+cptstabbing> Jump up on the pots that the spiders spawn from then they cant get ya
[2022-12-19 12:02:36] <%qb4trolls> According to twtich I'm top 1% catter in this channel. I wonder how this happened.... LUL
[2022-12-19 12:03:37] <%xjoev> @qb4trolls same :D
[2022-12-19 12:03:39] <S4cro> There might be a hidden loot room there just look for suspicious books
[2022-12-19 12:04:54] <+cptstabbing> In the labyrinth?
[2022-12-19 12:04:59] <+cptstabbing> On top of it
[2022-12-19 12:05:26] <%SU_Shadow> i wish i was a flying nerd, i am currently is just a landbound one
[2022-12-19 12:05:33] <+cptstabbing> Wasn't it a shield in the hidden roiom?
[2022-12-19 12:05:41] <S4cro> Did he loot your soul already?
[2022-12-19 12:06:17] <+cptstabbing> Zombies spawn in there
[2022-12-19 12:06:23] <+cptstabbing> at the big chest
[2022-12-19 12:06:56] <+cptstabbing> He can shoot trought the hole
[2022-12-19 12:07:21] <+cptstabbing> Invis spell?
[2022-12-19 12:07:37] <%LordOverflow> :D
[2022-12-19 12:08:02] <+cptstabbing> He has invis spell?
[2022-12-19 12:08:58] <SpiralEve> the fighter got blown up though

[2022-12-19 12:24:06] <%ITGuy_Gaming> one more level, lets go!
[2022-12-19 12:29:20] <SpiralEve> some people didnt like the zone in this game, but the reason i like it is because it keeps the extract portals random, if no zone, there would be more camping the escapes
[2022-12-19 12:29:33] <SpiralEve> i love that the portals are random though
[2022-12-19 12:35:21] <$alurosu> this game looks nice
[2022-12-19 12:35:33] <SpiralEve> they actually just slowed the zone down in a hotfix today haha
[2022-12-19 12:39:39] <%ITGuy_Gaming> L10 :D
[2022-12-19 12:39:43] <+quzohr> you have improved since I watched you 1 hr ago
[2022-12-19 12:39:52] <SpiralEve> good run! and yeah level 10 another perk!
[2022-12-19 12:40:34] <%ITGuy_Gaming> What are the quests with Merchants?
[2022-12-19 12:40:49] <SpiralEve> Not available yet @ITGuy_Gaming
[2022-12-19 12:40:55] <SpiralEve> but its just there
[2022-12-19 12:41:24] <SpiralEve> but they did add some crafting this patch as well, mining pick and make gear
[2022-12-19 12:42:33] <%ITGuy_Gaming> Any new shields?
[2022-12-19 12:42:38] <%ITGuy_Gaming> @SpiralEve ty
[2022-12-19 12:43:20] <SpiralEve> @P4wnyhof i love in the shop you can get a skin to make yourself look like a Skele Kappa
[2022-12-19 12:45:13] <%+phandoumas> how many ppl are in a run ?

[2022-12-19 12:48:07] <%+mrsundgren> What's this game about?
[2022-12-19 12:48:10] <+b4ck2r3ality> This isn't a cash store? is it?
[2022-12-19 12:48:17] <Ahh_Dean> They had walls in Egyptian times?
[2022-12-19 12:48:59] <SpiralEve> I reccomend with the extra cash grab like a stack of bandages and/or maybe a campfire for spell refill
[2022-12-19 12:49:11] <SpiralEve> campfire is a bit expensive but a stack of 3 bandages always good
[2022-12-19 12:50:13] <%+grimuletz> good morning, handsome!  game looks cool. mind sharing some more info on it? what type is it, where can we get it from/ what platforms etc? it looks like smth i would love to play with a friend

[2022-12-19 12:51:33] <%+mrsundgren> blood from a skeleton? exciting
[2022-12-19 12:55:47] <%ITGuy_Gaming> Those players are camping around a corner bcz. they know you need to move in the zone
[2022-12-19 12:59:38] <+b4ck2r3ality> leave fast
[2022-12-19 13:00:42] <megamoneyman911> can u play this solo boss?
[2022-12-19 13:02:32] <SpiralEve> Gold coin is just 1 gold Kappa
[2022-12-19 13:02:38] <SpiralEve> out of a 10 stack
[2022-12-19 13:02:51] <SpiralEve> honestly it took a while for me to figure that out too lol
[2022-12-19 13:03:48] <SpiralEve> Its really fun with friends, a solo mode i feel like would work in in this too though
[2022-12-19 13:05:24] <SpiralEve> That stuttering is new this wipe. hasnt been there previously

[2022-12-19 13:07:47] <SpiralEve> X to sheath weapons will run slightly faster for chasing rangers/rogues
[2022-12-19 13:08:02] <SpiralEve> but that was a good fight
