[2022-12-27 09:15:04] <+prav2850> They probably thought it‚Äôd be a resident sleeper control card like warrior to bait overplaying their hand
[2022-12-27 09:15:26] <%Kaguyavn> if druid has brawl I can see it
[2022-12-27 09:15:41] <+prav2850> Oh it‚Äôs a Druid card? Nvm
[2022-12-27 09:15:43] <%Impbloody> maybe you play that and nosdormu and your opponent gets confused reading the card lol
[2022-12-27 09:15:46] <%PamelaLansbury> good morning mr beard, good morning chat, I hope you're all having a wonderful holiday season and have a pleasant new years with lots of kisses, dog kisses specifically
[2022-12-27 09:15:46] <kp2416> @kaguyavn you just live as Druid then you play it with say a 4 mana 6-6 and then the next turn UI for free plus 10 more mana and hope you're not ded LOL card sucks
