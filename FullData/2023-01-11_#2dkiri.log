[2023-01-11 13:59:41] <%agravicvoid> ooh what a neat looking game kiriDance- and hi kiriWave
[2023-01-11 13:59:58] <Vh4r> A trawler is a fishing boat
[2023-01-11 14:00:05] <+DesignbyHowell> trawling is what boats do when they have big nets dragged behind them to catch fish
[2023-01-11 14:00:06] <vanivan239586038183905213> trawl is when you drag a net along the bottom of the sea to catch fish and other stuff iirc
[2023-01-11 14:00:09] <%Draksis45> Trawl: an act of fishing with a trawl net or seine.
[2023-01-11 14:00:09] <%$DamagedCarbine> trawling is like net fishing
[2023-01-11 14:00:13] <%agravicvoid> no game is complete without fishing mini games
[2023-01-11 14:00:15] <vanivan239586038183905213> somethign like that
[2023-01-11 14:00:18] <!%+Wrinxz> @billfershort Credit card or Debit? Debit associated to a checking account isn't as protected as an actual credit card. I hope it gets resolved quickly my friend kiriBless
[2023-01-11 14:00:20] <%$Reger464> trawl also means search

[2023-01-11 14:00:37] <%CarloTheCurious> trawl is a fishing term, but you can trawl though things as a person (e.g. trawl through twitch chat in search of a useful comment ;p )

[2023-01-11 14:00:58] <+DesignbyHowell> It's second meaning is to sift through a large amount of stuff to find something
[2023-01-11 14:01:01] <%$DamagedCarbine> I didn't know this. but apparently it also means: An act of searching for or examining something

[2023-01-11 14:02:52] <!%+Wrinxz> Thankfully the trick to Core Keepers mini game is to make sure you're catching "treasure/junk" instead of fish or I'd never have got the achievement. Well not that quickly.
