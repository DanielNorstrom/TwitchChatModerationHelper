[2022-12-25 09:49:12] <%KaitoOnTheClock> TheMoreYouKnow
[2022-12-25 09:49:51] <!%Nimnitz> Depending on how old your cables are you get a constant if weaker internet over your vcables
[2022-12-25 09:50:10] <!%Nimnitz> For example i got 7mbs with dlan
[2022-12-25 09:50:18] <%KaitoOnTheClock> @Nimnitz My apartment complex is so old so the cables are still insulated with waxed cloth
[2022-12-25 09:50:29] <!%Nimnitz> Wlan only gave me around 450 kbs

[2022-12-25 11:41:58] <!%Nimnitz> Cheer100 I heard recently about a school that was shamed into changing its school motto. The motto was "I hear, I see, I learn." Nothing wrong with that per se. Unfortunately the motto was in Latin, and the Latin for "I hear, I see, I learn" is "audio, video, disco."

[2022-12-25 14:04:46] <$ttkartemis> They are, but having good number of them without a camp in Tesla town is impossible LUL
[2022-12-25 14:04:51] <!HawoooBakeinu> If you research Automatons fully they can even hit like 95% work efficiency. Compared to 100% with full healthy humans.
[2022-12-25 14:05:24] <$ttkartemis> @HawoooBakeinu 90%, for extra 5% you need an event that only happens in the Arks scenario afaik
[2022-12-25 14:05:37] VIEWERS: 255
[2022-12-25 14:05:42] <!HawoooBakeinu> @HawoooBakeinu The event happens in main scenario too. I had it many times already
[2022-12-25 14:05:47] <%Edorah> even 60% is better than human work tho .-)
[2022-12-25 14:06:13] <JacqueDeOrsh> Fun fact - Automaton work efficiency is actually higher than humans, the game just doesn’t tell you that. The reason is because Automatons work 24/7, 10 more hours than humans do
[2022-12-25 14:06:13] <!HawoooBakeinu> Basically the robots can work in absolute coldness too. The steam hub just needs to be there, not even turned on to heat.
[2022-12-25 14:06:13] <%Edorah> ofc
[2022-12-25 14:06:15] <$ttkartemis> Yes
[2022-12-25 14:06:20] <!HawoooBakeinu> Yes
[2022-12-25 14:06:28] <!HawoooBakeinu> Upgraded coal mines are the best
[2022-12-25 14:06:29] <%Edorah> automatons only replace your workers, theyre basically the same
[2022-12-25 14:06:40] <!HawoooBakeinu> Automatons are better workers Ceri.

[2022-12-25 14:07:32] <JacqueDeOrsh> @ashura422 Refugees, the final phase pf the game is brutal
[2022-12-25 14:07:33] <+NekoArchangel> Nothing woopsHmm
[2022-12-25 14:07:34] <!HawoooBakeinu> Actually if an automaton runs it you can run a food house somewhere out in the nowhere in freezing cold LUL

[2022-12-25 15:16:17] <JacqueDeOrsh> Anyways, I was playing for the pther side of the spectrum - pretty much authoritarian communism. And I crossed the line, I signed the “New Order” law, which opened one VERY good thing - The Execution. Once every two or so days you can execute one person as the enemy of the state, driving discontent down (hope in New Order no longer is a resource, it’s defaulted to 100%). I had no food. I ran out of coal 3 days in, people were dying, but every two days another person was murdered nd that saved me
[2022-12-25 15:16:19] <!mrpersonaiity> even if there's 3 it looka like it would be hard to find
[2022-12-25 15:16:20] <%$ttkartemis> All the others have 3 afaik
[2022-12-25 15:16:37] <@%LT_Jakal> the default first map only has 2 I am very sure

[2022-12-25 15:29:04] <!HawoooBakeinu> There are a few scenarios I can highly recommend.

[2022-12-25 15:30:10] <Chessrook44> I mean, this IS basically the only city management game that has a BOSS BATTLE.

[2022-12-25 16:27:23] <$MyrkDomolith> Says they're part of the intrigue system and can recruit agents. Essentially spies and thiefs who go around, investigate other forts and sites, change loyalties and even steal artifacts while under a false identity. Nice~.

[2022-12-25 16:46:49] <$MyrkDomolith> @FunkyChickens007 Something you might have to go to a doctor for, if it's that bad. LUL In all seriousness, nothing really. Even with all the QoL improvements this game can be a challenge to get in to. The in-game tutorial SHOULD help you learn the controls, but it doesn't really leave you in a good spot as far as fort survival.
[2022-12-25 16:46:53] <jaxin75> dwarves can't climb, their legs are too short
