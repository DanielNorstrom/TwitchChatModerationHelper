[2023-01-06 11:31:49] <%+orctiz_king_of_sloths> Black in white 1 and 2 run on a old windows architector that make them not compatable with curent builds of windows. if you want to play it you can you will just need to run a older version of windows on your PC. You can do this by emulating or by setting up a box on your PC that can fun old windows. or you can do what i did and build an old PC i like the old PC method my self.

[2023-01-06 12:09:32] <Knife_Eared> I might give it a go
[2023-01-06 12:09:33] <%+RubyRose2077> i think Armored core 6 will be souls like, they are gonna change how the games play now that Souls likes are popular. but if they prove me wrong the mass people are not gonna like Armored core's gameplay
[2023-01-06 12:09:39] <%VrtniPatuljak> sounds like warhammer

[2023-01-06 12:09:59] <%GabrielFranc0> Same applies to warhammer… you need a lot of patience
[2023-01-06 12:10:10] <Duazzet> @RubyRose2077 No, Miyazaki said in interview its nothing like souls. Its just same old armored core.

[2023-01-06 12:10:10] <myheaven09> stamina bar for robots , souls like game Kapp
[2023-01-06 12:10:14] <%OnikenUK> @RubyRose2077 they already said in interviews it wont change because of souls, going to be mission based still
[2023-01-06 12:10:23] <%Dr_Truter> reminds me of the riddler in arkham city
[2023-01-06 12:10:23] <%+RubyRose2077> oh well people are gonna not like that as much as souls
[2023-01-06 12:10:28] <%B00GE> Why would they make armored core like souls when it already has an established series LUL

[2023-01-06 12:11:04] <%VrtniPatuljak> because souls fans only know souls, they see From and assume

[2023-01-06 12:12:08] <Duazzet> @RubyRose2077 Well thing is that Miyazaki dont really care if ppl dont like it as much as Souls games. He just really really wants to make new armored core.

[2023-01-06 12:17:13] <%TurtleExpress> Problem with streaming is that you need a server relatively close to you. I dont know how that works in Japan, but shouldnt be a problem when you move back to the US

[2023-01-06 14:03:06] <$The3Kingdoms> @RetroGaijin i just googled it - Donate 33,333 gold to the temple of avo to get the Sentinus, to pull the sword you need max of all your strength attributes. level 7 in physique, toughness, and health. there is no way to see the god Avo. Also The Harbringer sword isn't that strong.
[2023-01-06 14:03:09] <+Tristar49> Did u life the sword from the stone?

[2023-01-06 14:04:22] <$Dwiin> actually, to pull the sword you need to improve your stats after your first try it.
[2023-01-06 14:04:25] <@%+Sotenbori> It is the second best one-handed weapon
[2023-01-06 14:04:30] <@%+Sotenbori> Or at least the top 5

[2023-01-06 14:16:39] <Shivalla> 1.buy a huge number of an item(will potions or gems) 2.Make sure to get at least over 60 of the item for profit 3A. use the trader near the gate of Bowerstone South(for potions) 3B. use the general goods trader in knothole glade(for gems) 4.buy and sell the items back and forth between the screens as many times as you want. 5.repeat,repeat,repeat. 6.PROFIT!!!
[2023-01-06 14:16:44] <Crouz_z> @RetroGaijin if it hasent changed the more items shop owners got the tcheaper ut us ti get the items (buy it all at once) then sell it (all at once) and they give you more monay for it ,do that with the expensive gemmes at the village when you were a kid and you get rich superrrrr fast . . . :'D no cap
[2023-01-06 14:16:48] <BTheWhite> @chorionicmirror what about buying all items of 1 at a salesman, then selling it b ack immediatly at the higher rate?

[2023-01-06 14:17:39] <$Dwiin> so the fastest way to make money legit is to play a gambling game, Spot the Addition you can play with Slow Time to keep doing it.

[2023-01-06 14:20:02] <+justlikemikeyj> Find some ladies and men of Ill-repute...  But look really good...  Slowly start offering their company for a small fee.  When people are upset about the fee or the company, beat them up and take there money...  As the individuals feel more confidant with you, you can let them collect from the customer directly, and give you a cut...  It's a prost...  A pyrami...  A money making scheme...

[2023-01-06 15:19:20] <!+sgt_rubberducky9> there is a community patch for the emulator but it has allot of texture bugs
[2023-01-06 15:19:25] <+biggitybenjamin> 2 is the best imo
