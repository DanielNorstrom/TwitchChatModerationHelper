[2022-12-29 00:07:45] <%zorg666> they dont actually base the rank off the win\loss ratio, but it wouldn't be surprising if what they base it off of is strongly correlated with win\loss ratio
[2022-12-29 00:07:49] <%+gm_brewlay> I think wins streaks help you rank up, but your MMR goes up and down every win/loss

[2022-12-29 00:09:55] <%zorg666> I think the win\loss ratio is strongly correlated with rank, but don't think it was that they are basing it off of

[2022-12-29 00:10:03] <+Jellybee85> yea this is where i see ppl's profiles, and see if their rank is your elo or not.

[2022-12-29 07:02:45] <+DarkLight917> You guys had a zen and a mercy which is basically the least amount of healing, encouraging a super passive play waiting for your dps to get picks with the zen.
[2022-12-29 07:02:47] <+vendettareaps> that works when helers pick the best dps or tank to heal

[2022-12-29 13:28:18] <%atomchoco> yes
[2022-12-29 13:28:19] <%markpygas> Rein was my main in OW1, he's so fun
[2022-12-29 13:28:21] <nickayyy> YES HAHAHAAH
[2022-12-29 13:28:22] <%+xlordx100> yes
[2022-12-29 13:28:22] <sunsetyellow> yeah leave em
[2022-12-29 13:28:25] <harharr95> kekw
[2022-12-29 13:28:29] <sunsetyellow> ana can combo and burst them
[2022-12-29 13:28:29] <Rogue_Marcus> not to sound like a bad critic but in the defend round the switch to Zarya would have been the better choice
[2022-12-29 13:28:30] <%dearenier> oh
[2022-12-29 13:28:32] <%5up> depends on sometimes you leave a person asleep, sometimes you wait for everyone to walk up and kill them
[2022-12-29 13:28:34] <%markpygas> Unless you can kill them instantly, you leave them
[2022-12-29 13:28:36] <@%mrkmattos> if it's a squishy then yeah you can burst
[2022-12-29 13:28:37] <sunsetyellow> yes but you gotta wait for your team to help with the burst
[2022-12-29 13:28:43] <%TheGreatBillyMays> they wake up on any damage reception
[2022-12-29 13:28:44] <%+xlordx100> well sometimes
[2022-12-29 13:28:46] <@%fabriisio> NOTED
[2022-12-29 13:28:47] <GreaterDeath> btw if I didn't say this earlier I was thinking chin on knees when I said use legs as headrest
[2022-12-29 13:28:49] <%5up> but yea a few of your long distance shots woke ppl up, you generally want to stand like on top of them
[2022-12-29 13:28:51] <@%fabriisio> we learning NOTED
[2022-12-29 13:28:52] <%+mfpow1> in higher elo it usualy is, people will countdown in voice chat "3..2...1" then the whole team kills the target
[2022-12-29 13:28:59] <%5up> then our dps target focusing was fairly bad
[2022-12-29 13:28:59] <%dearenier> i am learning
[2022-12-29 13:28:59] <%markpygas> If you can kill them before they get up, you can burst em
[2022-12-29 13:29:01] <nickayyy> situational, if its in a intense fight, leave him so u can have a 4v5 team fight
[2022-12-29 13:29:04] <%markpygas> If not, leave them out of the fight

[2022-12-29 14:06:01] <%markpygas> At least you got POTG
[2022-12-29 14:06:04] <behindinfinity> I think lance spin works better if you run up to their face
[2022-12-29 14:06:16] <%atomchoco> we learn everyday

[2022-12-29 14:06:28] <behindinfinity> like you could knock back the Sym if you ran at her and then shoot her when she's staggered
[2022-12-29 14:06:32] <%markpygas> worked out in the end

[2022-12-29 14:09:52] <uneasyfeelings> Gotta be aggressive with the first ability and push them back
[2022-12-29 14:09:54] <LuuLuis_P> or instead of Orison any tank will do that deals dmg

[2022-12-29 14:10:58] <TheGuyHeretic> A reaper or junk would be POG right about now
[2022-12-29 14:11:00] <the_silent_gamer3> push them back with the 1st kill
[2022-12-29 14:11:06] <LuuLuis_P> like if all headshots
[2022-12-29 14:11:14] <%+claytona_gaming> I think kiriko headshots have a 3x multiplier on them
[2022-12-29 14:11:20] <%markpygas> nice double

[2022-12-29 14:14:25] <%atomchoco> its hard to get out of her ult
[2022-12-29 14:14:27] <%Mr_Pirate> Orisa is good when you play her aggressively and her ulti is pretty OP

[2022-12-29 14:16:33] <yuckiducki> dva was sm more fun for me with another tank
[2022-12-29 14:16:33] <behindinfinity> you did well as Orisa for not being used to her! gentle reminder her spinny thing works better if you run up at someone's face because it knocks them back <3

[2022-12-29 14:16:36] <Rogue_Marcus> orisa is a tanky tank you just kept using fortified at the wrong time
[2022-12-29 14:16:36] <yuckiducki> still love playing her tho

[2022-12-29 14:17:44] <Rogue_Marcus> but you did amazing considering you dont main orisa
[2022-12-29 14:17:48] <behindinfinity> @LuuLuis_P Orisa ult + Moira ult is amazing together
[2022-12-29 14:17:50] <%+PrizeGottiGaming> I'd rather have 2 tanks on my team  instead of 2 useless supports.

[2022-12-29 17:15:15] <Golden_shadowz01> @nowhereman__ All characters technically have their own DPS but the DPS character tend to have the highest and are meant to do damage specifically. That’s why they are in the DPS slots

[2022-12-29 18:23:16] <ashleyferns> Depends if you can isolate art from the artist
[2022-12-29 18:23:19] <t4itum20> i think its allowed to like something even if the creator is terrible, as long as you can acknowledge the creator has done shitty things and don’t financially support it do what you will

[2022-12-29 18:23:42] <jiracheez> she doesn't get the profit for merchandise
[2022-12-29 18:23:43] <c0okiecutter> youre supporting them if you purchase them
[2022-12-29 18:23:46] <t4itum20> pirate instead!

[2022-12-29 18:23:50] <BluELoQ> depends on how weird but if its really off putting id just not see their work the same way
[2022-12-29 18:23:52] <+ocloudo> i only separate art from the artist when im not directly contributing to that person so like if they died etc
[2022-12-29 18:23:52] <%luchadora> oh hell no i wouldnt wear the merch in public
[2022-12-29 18:23:57] <asianboi0212> i mean alot of ppl probably pirate it sooo...

[2022-12-29 18:24:24] <annejuliii> i dont really know what to feel about it bc i like hp but her opinions are part of hp
[2022-12-29 18:24:26] <cpstyxx> I think Harry Potter as a franchise has moved quite far away from jk. she may have created it, but shes not the sole creative or representation behind it anymore

[2022-12-29 18:24:47] <+kirito31313> but is she wrong
[2022-12-29 18:24:51] <webbernsk> you support bad people with almost every action you do every day, so don't keep yourself from getting stuff you want
[2022-12-29 18:24:57] <xneptabyss> Wearing merch of the person itself is still weird like a sports Jersey. But a creation, like a show or an idea seems okay to me
[2022-12-29 18:24:58] <+Aserus_Nai> for JK i think it's very easy to separate the harry potter realm from her

[2022-12-29 21:47:00] <XuathUrzXath> caffeine is poison
[2022-12-29 21:47:00] <+One_Eh> too much caffeine isnt great, but thats more so over a long period of time
[2022-12-29 21:47:02] <mfsweatypenguin> caffeine can get your heart in a lethal rhythm.
[2022-12-29 21:47:02] <DivineOrmagoden> It can and it depends on your health condition

[2022-12-29 21:47:23] <AsterialWolf> but idk
[2022-12-29 21:47:25] <supremekai_weeb> actually drinking lots of energy drinks can give u a heart attack

[2022-12-29 21:47:36] <mfsweatypenguin> in a long time frame, it can cause an enlarged heart
[2022-12-29 21:47:37] <%tthomiv> caffeine is a drug no cap when i quit i had withdrawl symptoms for like a week
[2022-12-29 21:47:39] <StoicSpiderlily9> if you have over 5 cups probably
[2022-12-29 21:47:40] <antw44n> Caffeine can change ur heart rhythm which could cause a heart attack
[2022-12-29 21:47:45] <AsterialWolf> @xdjohn_ same
[2022-12-29 21:47:46] <KTop27> they say 400mg of caffeine and nothing more should be daily if anything
[2022-12-29 21:47:46] <DivineOrmagoden> Okay if it’s energy drinks yeah that’ll do it
[2022-12-29 21:47:47] <Tsouda> 36 oh my lord
[2022-12-29 21:47:53] <abean46> Can mess with heart beat if a lot is consumed

[2022-12-29 21:50:04] <kendo_zZ> does ow2 not have arcade/custom games setup yet? i know in the original you could make custom lobbies like for qp/comp style games
[2022-12-29 21:50:07] <supremekai_weeb> @divineormagoden my opinion i think it's best to drink two can of energy drinks a week and have a bottle of water or two on the side
