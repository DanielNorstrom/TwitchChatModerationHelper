[2022-12-27 19:41:15] <%$istreet98> I think the issue is too make people play FUT now which is why they've reduced pack weight, otherwise prices would be on the floor. And which is why they're pushing more to untradeable

[2022-12-27 19:45:22] <itsRamzilla> Benz, Messi and Mbappe is a pretty obvious 3.

[2022-12-27 19:45:41] <masatex7> Will Messi win Ballon de or?
[2022-12-27 19:45:43] <joegranelli> Benzema will be, he won the ballon‚Äôdor
[2022-12-27 19:45:44] <+brendanmcd8> lewa was poor at end of season for bayern - great at start - not a special WC
[2022-12-27 19:45:45] <@%+DavidMNobrega> If Lewa gets it over Benzema I think that's incredibly unfair
[2022-12-27 19:45:47] <+durii11> you should support platense

[2022-12-27 19:48:01] <zaraankhan200> benzema is better than Haaland because he won more also he did well last season
[2022-12-27 19:48:03] <lpd1996> @pyrofut not looking good for him
[2022-12-27 19:48:09] <+brendanmcd8> the importance of the goals Benz score tho...cant discount

[2022-12-27 19:48:19] <@%+DavidMNobrega> It's a crazy amount of Lewa but I think less important

[2022-12-27 19:48:30] <sparkly24432> Benzema will get one anyway because he won DOR

[2022-12-27 19:48:37] <%theJFKexperience0> Lewa is the best striker of the last 10 years
[2022-12-27 19:48:42] <+telma_mukambi> nah not better if you consider the games hes scored in
[2022-12-27 19:48:43] <basedgod417_> Benzema, mbappe, vini should win Toty (Le√£o close behind)

[2022-12-27 19:51:38] <+louisw26> they just has possession united had the better chances i think

[2022-12-27 19:54:08] <+smokeymcpot_99> Top 4 would be a success for arsenal this season, the position you‚Äôre in atm means you should be aiming higher though
[2022-12-27 19:54:13] <MaliBoomZAR> our primary goal was UCL football. I want the league now as an Arsenal fan, we are playing like a team that can win the league too

[2022-12-27 19:54:40] <+sealdawg> This Arsenal team is nowhere good enough to win league most seasons. Awful midfield

[2022-12-27 19:54:58] <+sealdawg> City miles better than Arsenal
[2022-12-27 19:54:59] <marinojab> Arsenal are an amazing team I just feel they need a big name one day and maybe a big name in defence and your set for a while. Many young players with big potentiel
[2022-12-27 19:55:03] <%melvin25_> I believe Arsenal will win  it
