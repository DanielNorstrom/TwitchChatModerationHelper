[2022-12-10 17:04:17] <%+childs_plays> no one pitted cops before this
[2022-12-10 17:04:19] <%+NYGamble> they got away originally but they found them when trying to take car to spot
[2022-12-10 17:04:19] <+killernugge> he lost sum sum a few times
[2022-12-10 17:04:20] <NotTheFakeTJ> Apparently tracker was off
[2022-12-10 17:04:20] <%+Strikerzz9> his reasoning what the crew were being aggressive with interference
[2022-12-10 17:04:21] <RocknRoll69yo> cop just want the W

[2022-12-10 17:05:17] <%+NYGamble> yep
[2022-12-10 17:05:21] <%+Bloodshot91> i mean if the chase is 30 mins and multiple interference vehicles, he had every right to pit like that

[2022-12-10 17:05:36] <%p99_daddydonald> and kept getting away but the cars were scuffed
[2022-12-10 17:05:37] <stevetwitch7> That’s putting ?
[2022-12-10 17:05:43] <oaui> NOTED  hutch has no nipples
[2022-12-10 17:05:45] <lTEEI> casterman legit had to use 3 adv kits lmao
[2022-12-10 17:05:48] <stevetwitch7> That’s pitting ?
[2022-12-10 17:06:01] <Coreytries> It had been like 10 minutes later after the chase too
[2022-12-10 17:06:02] <+killernugge> u gotta watch the other side as well
[2022-12-10 17:06:02] <smok3eh> summit said casterman mustve learned to drive from croc LUL
[2022-12-10 17:06:10] <NotTheFakeTJ> https://www.twitch.tv/cosmic/clip/OptimisticBreakableMagpieWOOP-6sYZuyIADAD-9CQ4 This is his POV btw
[2022-12-10 17:06:11] <%+NYGamble> That's the issue I see here too, pitting is fine, but that wasn't really pitting

[2022-12-10 17:06:18] <xJustPayBacKx> The first hit can be considered a pit, but every hit after that is not pitting, some people need to look up what a PIT is KEKW
[2022-12-10 17:06:18] <+frostygunzzzz> @VexedVarianT no it didnt the second and third did but not the first
[2022-12-10 17:06:20] <RvTv_> !graphics
[2022-12-10 17:06:21] <Buckem> they were pits in his eyes, the dsync was crazy tbh
[2022-12-10 17:06:21] <+Cheetosrule> did u watch it from casterman's perspective? it looks a little diferent @HutchMF
[2022-12-10 17:06:22] <%+childs_plays> the first pit.. yes good job but the other 3 of him ramming into it was a little much
[2022-12-10 17:06:26] <%+kurt4201> 100%
[2022-12-10 17:06:27] <+olivia_copper_fan> all hail King Hutch
[2022-12-10 17:06:27] <+killernugge> it didnt look that bad from castermans pov
[2022-12-10 17:06:30] <%+i_am_harvey> that wasn't a pit, it was ramming
[2022-12-10 17:06:30] <%Emarie> Pitting is one thing, that was a rocket launch with SRBs
[2022-12-10 17:06:35] <zypher01> the boys might have been pitting a bit before that but nothing crazy. seemed pretty unjustified
[2022-12-10 17:06:39] <%drayvar_> there's a difference between putting and ramming. he was ramming the vehicle.
[2022-12-10 17:06:39] <+HostileBirdhat> Pitting then try to box is fine but that was excessive
[2022-12-10 17:06:43] <tipsyturkey38> Agree full right to pit. No need to do mad max
[2022-12-10 17:06:46] <Myk63> If that is justification for cops shooting it's justification for crims.
[2022-12-10 17:06:47] <triggeredviewer> look at the speed
[2022-12-10 17:06:53] <RocknRoll69yo> omg
[2022-12-10 17:06:56] <frostygunzzzz> yeah that doesnt look the same does it
[2022-12-10 17:06:57] <%d3ltaf0x> that was a pit

[2022-12-10 17:07:10] <%+Carvine> yeah under 100 is a pit
[2022-12-10 17:07:10] <+YumboYak25> “Didn’t look that bad” lol okay chat

[2022-12-10 17:07:12] <%TheLegendarySpanky> that is a pit
[2022-12-10 17:07:13] <%triggeredviewer> first one is ok, after is whats bad
[2022-12-10 17:07:15] <%+VexedVarianT> 100 is max speed now tho
[2022-12-10 17:07:17] <%+Carvine> thats how it works
[2022-12-10 17:07:20] <FoulThunder> it's good pit
[2022-12-10 17:07:23] <%sherminator011> thats you want that person's fun to end 100
[2022-12-10 17:07:29] <llama21mango> make cop cars flip and break as much as crims and see how often they do that.
[2022-12-10 17:07:36] <+frostygunzzzz> yes bubble made it worse but it wasnt a straight ram
[2022-12-10 17:07:43] <Catatonic21> @VexedVarianT ya if your in a b class lmao
[2022-12-10 17:07:44] <+HostileBirdhat> It's okay, his bubble made it worse, the next 2 "pits" were too much
[2022-12-10 17:07:54] <$FatManJon2> Bubble is insane
[2022-12-10 17:08:04] <House_and_Molly> Pretty indefensible that 2nd one
[2022-12-10 17:08:05] <%+NYGamble> the bubble isn't helping
[2022-12-10 17:08:10] <xJustPayBacKx> That Supra is light as hell KEKW
[2022-12-10 17:08:11] <FoulThunder> now the 2nd time it's  not good to do
[2022-12-10 17:08:13] <+tehuuu> looks like that supra has no weight at all, and flying all over :/
[2022-12-10 17:08:14] <IVIRHayden> bubble causing 70% of it tho
[2022-12-10 17:08:14] <+silvahawk21> the issue he is pitting without trying to box
[2022-12-10 17:08:16] <tomc1k> yeah chat hoppers did not help the situation too

[2022-12-10 17:08:41] <dietn5> just asking im from EU buth pitting is that not with the front side instead with full front
[2022-12-10 17:08:50] <+LootGang_> @ivirhayden Yeah cops are trained to bubble pit

[2022-12-10 17:09:05] <+HostileBirdhat> I would not have pitted there, he was barely going just block his ass
[2022-12-10 17:09:05] <+LootGang_> They have to or else it’s be tbone central

[2022-12-10 17:09:42] <ColdarionMF> @HutchMF how do u adjust idk rly what tht means
[2022-12-10 17:10:10] <+tehuuu> looks like that supra has no weight at all, and flying all over :/
[2022-12-10 17:10:23] <House_and_Molly> I can see why CG got mad, and i can see why cosmic thinks he did fine
[2022-12-10 17:10:33] <+workh0rse_> this was an ooc sequence to me lol
[2022-12-10 17:10:36] <IVIRHayden> lets see full speed one last PauseChamp
[2022-12-10 17:10:37] <+Darksen> hitting a car in the middle is not a pit
[2022-12-10 17:10:51] <minirine_> it was pretty desynced for summit, looked like he was T boning unfortunatley
[2022-12-10 17:10:54] <%SKMOforge> @workh0rse_ stop saying OOC just shut up omg
[2022-12-10 17:10:55] <kid_thor> the desync and ping makes it look bad from the other  side
[2022-12-10 17:10:57] <NotTheFakeTJ> I think the first pit he didn't expect summit to turn left
[2022-12-10 17:10:58] <ianjarvi5> And no wonder they get shot up
[2022-12-10 17:10:58] <+TheMeowstardCat> @Darksen I agree.
[2022-12-10 17:11:04] <%+daddyuvi> Think what summit was most upset about was that the cop couldn't keep up as primary the whole chase
[2022-12-10 17:11:08] <sadpluto666> dead channel
[2022-12-10 17:11:11] <%+NYGamble> yep, it kinda shitty both ways unfortunately
[2022-12-10 17:11:12] <%sherminator011> im just glad they blew him up after
[2022-12-10 17:11:22] <%nipplesoffreeman> Yeah they hurt there toe for sure on that one
[2022-12-10 17:11:27] <Coreytries> This chase also happened at least 10 minutes after they lost them too
[2022-12-10 17:11:29] <llama21mango> only reason that happened was because the cop reversing making chawa slow down
[2022-12-10 17:11:32] <+Zonii> Yeah looks different from this POV
[2022-12-10 17:11:32] <zypher01> Not a very fun or interesting way to end the chase/RP
[2022-12-10 17:11:33] <+ben_v_art> yeah they were desynced bad
[2022-12-10 17:11:36] <+workh0rse_> @workh0rse_ holy shit, touch some grass man
[2022-12-10 17:11:58] <Catatonic21> @zypher01 didnt end there they finished the boost
[2022-12-10 17:11:59] <+LorAster01> 99<100
[2022-12-10 17:12:11] <+LorAster01> factually correct NOTED
[2022-12-10 17:12:17] <ColdarionMF> @HutchMF how do u adjust idk rly what tht means
[2022-12-10 17:12:18] <%SKMOforge> @workh0rse_ ?
[2022-12-10 17:12:23] <+Myk63> But that would get cops shooting.
[2022-12-10 17:12:30] <%defiantal> Mornin' @HutchMF. Here's hoping you demagnetized today. LUL
[2022-12-10 17:12:30] <zypher01> @zypher01 no shit
[2022-12-10 17:12:32] <%leikoze> May not be a rule,  but the crims are gunnna feel a certain way about it that will get you grenaded at a gas pump
[2022-12-10 17:12:34] <%Emarie> whiplash of the century
[2022-12-10 17:12:38] <FoulThunder> I mean a crim doing it's crim thing ,but if cop does ,wait he is cop he needs to do correctly tho
[2022-12-10 17:12:40] <+workh0rse_> @workh0rse_ turn your computer off for 1 day bro
[2022-12-10 17:12:51] <+HostileBirdhat> I have no issues with the pit in itself, the problem is the constant ramming and throwing him off on the tracks KEKW
[2022-12-10 17:12:56] <+LorAster01> it just seems so salty because he lost them prior to that
[2022-12-10 17:13:03] <minirine_> and in return K gave them C4 :)
[2022-12-10 17:13:13] <RocknRoll69yo> ramming was bullshit

[2022-12-10 20:41:41] <KazumoR> I'm pretty new to this type of content, but why does the police hesitate so much to use guns in a chase?

[2022-12-10 20:41:57] <KazumoR> Is it because the RP would end too quickly or something?

[2022-12-10 20:42:27] <%+HeSoGrizzly> LFG! r35
[2022-12-10 20:42:37] <+T40r> @KazumoR well think about it in real life terms, cops wouldnt just shoot someone for running. WHILE this is roleplay and real life is different, this is one of the rare cases it meets
[2022-12-10 20:42:37] <+xYipyup> @KazumoR they have to follow SOP
[2022-12-10 20:42:37] <%+Byronious> I hope the action today is as good as yesterday
[2022-12-10 20:42:37] <%+GobletGoblin> @KazumoR It's very complicated. They have rules of engagement to follow which is the TLDR
[2022-12-10 20:42:48] <warriorgage> @HutchMF whats the best car in the city you think?

[2022-12-10 20:43:31] <KazumoR> Thanks for the answers guys. I feel like they might have a slight disadvantage because the bad guys always seem to be able to start shooting, while the police doesn't.

[2022-12-10 20:44:16] <+T40r> @KazumoR oh sure, but crims can only have 6 people involved while cops have like 12-14? something like that

[2022-12-10 20:44:21] <+Pazz> Nissan dealers are asking $50o over MSRP for 2023 Zs.. so $117k for a Nissan

[2022-12-10 20:45:20] <KazumoR> @T40r Do the guys who are chased ever get caught? So far the only clips I've seen, they always manage to get away somehow, because the police never shoots at them, they run on foot until they reach another car, and repeat.
[2022-12-10 20:45:27] <%$StevenB79> When is the Pampers sponsor stream?

[2022-12-10 20:48:14] <+T40r> @KazumoR so a bit of both, depending on what they do/what was done. They get months added to their sentence (months = minutes in real life) and they get sent to jail and fined. They can do things in jail to lower their time etc. But do something bad enough and its held until trial
[2022-12-10 20:48:17] <%+boostedcircus> what game @curtisryan

[2022-12-10 20:49:19] <+T40r> @KazumoR oh 100% I rp in NP WL and looking at this from the outside is WILD and can be so confusing
[2022-12-10 20:50:24] <%+HeSoGrizzly> this should be fun KEKW
[2022-12-10 20:50:29] <%+thegolfguy15> hutchmfPls
[2022-12-10 20:50:34] <KazumoR> I'm playing on basic medium-RP anyway so this is completely different. I was super surprised at first to see that accidents are not really 'rolled', like people getting out of the cars crawling and stuff. But I understood that they don't do that because it would kinda ruin the fun of the chase if you have to act like you've hurt yourself over every single crash.
[2022-12-10 20:50:49] <grumpygr1ngo> its good too hear gav again xD
