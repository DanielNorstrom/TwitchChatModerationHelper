[2022-12-22 15:52:38] <LANiD> ahh yes inertia... because devs get angwy when they get jiggle peeked and tarkov is not a video game but a rEALISTIC simulator.

[2022-12-22 15:54:53] <%+captf1shyf1nger> i like the inertia because to me it prevents the call of duty style ridiculous movement that you see in so many FPS games these days
[2022-12-22 15:55:03] <%+SeeMoreMcFly> if youre not used to the speed movement then you will get reked in tarkov. It definitely leveled the playing field to be a bit better for new players

[2022-12-22 15:59:09] <+ReK_42> @captf1shyf1nger I agree about cod but I think unrealistic movement is totally fine if it's done well. Splitgate is an excellent modern example. COD just tries to appeal to as many people as possible so it sits in this weird middle ground that isn't realistic but also isn't interesting
