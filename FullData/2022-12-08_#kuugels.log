[2022-12-08 18:18:00] <ka1kaze> I need to figure out what im doing wrong than I keep dyeing on both my classes. is there anyone maybe that might be willing to add on discord and kind of give me some kind of guidance for the game some other time and hunter is awesome is a lot of fun
[2022-12-08 18:18:18] <byndoser> gl
[2022-12-08 18:18:23] <%+Dreagge> felt like choices were, tank dps or healer from the 3 first ones

[2022-12-08 18:19:35] <+kchille> i've mained a hunter since day 1. but some of the new warlock and titan builds are just so much better than hunter i've been playing them more lately.
[2022-12-08 18:20:04] <+kchille> titan solar helmet is just invincible in pve

[2022-12-08 18:22:10] <%+Dreagge> well the warlock sounded hella fun too, the (titan?) sounded most boring one ngl
[2022-12-08 18:22:43] VIEWERS: 268
[2022-12-08 18:23:14] <+kchille> none of the classes are boring imo.
[2022-12-08 18:23:19] <%+Dreagge> thats perfect then, stroker hella boring too
[2022-12-08 18:23:39] <IzeBit> tamer is boring
[2022-12-08 18:23:53] <ka1kaze> titan  has a build where you can do a punch that does 1 million damage
[2022-12-08 18:23:54] <+kchille> in destiny*
[2022-12-08 18:24:43] VIEWERS: 280
[2022-12-08 18:24:56] <+kchille> solar titan with throwing hammer + wormgod exotic. = win
[2022-12-08 18:26:02] <%+Dreagge> okey next question, at what point you start to be relevant in pvp in destiny?
[2022-12-08 18:26:44] VIEWERS: 280
[2022-12-08 18:26:55] <ka1kaze> relevant whenever however you can also just look at the meta for pvp and than use that it you prefer
[2022-12-08 18:27:00] <+kchille> i'd say by the time you finish the campaign. you'll have acquired enough weapon choices to make a viable loadout
[2022-12-08 18:27:42] <%+Dreagge> But, do my weapons in example. Take 3 clips to kill someone, or do it somehow balance?
[2022-12-08 18:27:43] <ka1kaze> ever play during the gravaton lance meta
[2022-12-08 18:27:56] <+kchille> no. it's not like BDO in that way
[2022-12-08 18:27:59] <+kchille> it's normalized
[2022-12-08 18:28:16] <%+Dreagge> So my starter pistol same does dmg as higher gs ones?
[2022-12-08 18:28:34] <+kchille> so a 140rpm hand canon will do the same damage regardless of gear level.
[2022-12-08 18:28:40] <+kchille> correct
[2022-12-08 18:28:44] VIEWERS: 276
[2022-12-08 18:28:48] <%juntao2g> hai kuugels <3
[2022-12-08 18:28:56] <ka1kaze> as long as its not iron banner and there isnt some special effect to an exotic weapon than yes they do same damage
[2022-12-08 18:29:03] <%juntao2g> hope all is well for you and also hope youre feeling better :P
[2022-12-08 18:29:09] <+kchille> things that alter damage is weapon perks
[2022-12-08 18:29:33] <%juntao2g> doing ight about to start some bdo for a bit :)
[2022-12-08 18:29:57] <+kchille> so like ace of spaces is a 140 rpm hand cannon but it has a perk memento mori that makes it do the damage of a 120rpm after you reload from a kill.
[2022-12-08 18:30:10] <+kchille> but it's not like BDO gear score. affecting your abilities in pvp
[2022-12-08 18:30:22] <%+Dreagge> Aight thats kinda sweet then, gotta try some pvp out at some point then

[2022-12-08 18:32:23] <+kchille> destiny pvp is far more reliant on your movement and positioning than a lot of other fps games. cause it's so much faster pace than most fps games.
[2022-12-08 18:32:44] <+kchille> so your aim can be god tier but if your movement sucks you're gonna get shredded
