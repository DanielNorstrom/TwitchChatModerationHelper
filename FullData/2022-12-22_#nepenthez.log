[2022-12-22 00:41:18] <+zaneyj98> gone from div 3 to elite on new gen in past couple weeks, div 3 is easily the hardest until you get to elite
[2022-12-22 00:41:22] <XTeNX11> nep how's trippier been?
[2022-12-22 00:41:23] <gg13theking> timer stop bro
[2022-12-22 00:41:27] <%+Supplecactus> Elite Divison on new gen was the worst mistake I made getting to. I hate it
[2022-12-22 00:41:28] <%+ReazMimic> I got cantona in my icon pack the other day and i really dislike him unless hes playing CM, then hes mediocre
[2022-12-22 00:41:29] <robinn_x> is the gameplay more enjoyable on old gen or is it just a case of weaker opponents?
[2022-12-22 00:41:31] <+FUNFACT0R> Happy Holidays NepemtheZ!  how's Trippier been for you today?
[2022-12-22 00:41:44] <%+kingnovakin> I can‚Äôt get over 550 sr on new gen, might have to give old gen a whirl KappaClaus
[2022-12-22 00:41:44] <m4nny1403> @gg13theking the times is supposed to be stopped
[2022-12-22 00:41:44] <%$LilFishFart> seen any good 81+ x11?
[2022-12-22 00:41:45] <Mazzah___> Trippier is very good for me
[2022-12-22 00:41:45] <+sergibonga> @gg13theking he finished already
[2022-12-22 00:41:47] <%+jaythemillerman> was you happy with that 4hrs or would you have changed anything
[2022-12-22 00:41:48] <jack_bay> Whats the best pack options if u do all 25 tooens

[2022-12-22 00:41:49] <champs1x> Are servers down i cant get in??
[2022-12-22 00:41:53] <marketmaestro> nep do you reckon if i do 81x11 now and do trippier now i can still get enough for the 3(83x25)s
[2022-12-22 00:41:56] <+OldManCod> its mostly because the players base is less on old gen and easier to find easy games i guess
[2022-12-22 00:42:02] <+jamesgomez03> Does old gen actually play much different aside from the player pool difference you‚Äôve mentioned
[2022-12-22 00:42:14] <XTeNX11> @LilFishFart i watched all the youtubers and didnt see one so no, best was probably like 88 or even less
[2022-12-22 00:42:25] <+Aaron_McD9> It‚Äôs still mad to me that juranovic didn‚Äôt get a special card throughout the World Cup he was brilliant
[2022-12-22 00:42:37] <XTeNX11> 84 squad for vlasic is mad
[2022-12-22 00:42:38] <$Rocky94RPC> Any down side to doing old gen?

[2022-12-22 00:45:11] <XTeNX11> WC Kuyt is the most underrated card in the game, insane that he only costs 260k

[2022-12-22 00:51:42] <%+keisarikivi> payback for RvP lool
[2022-12-22 00:51:43] <+Bigshakk> Cr7 is the most anti arteta signing
[2022-12-22 00:51:47] <%fifa_mikek> way too toxic
[2022-12-22 00:51:48] <%+kingnovakin> Messi extending his psg contract for another year
[2022-12-22 00:51:48] <%Creativename_> No way man, all the work Jesus does for Arsenal, Ronaldo wouldn't do half of it
[2022-12-22 00:51:58] <here4rewards_> cr7 doesn't like being bencehd though
[2022-12-22 00:52:00] <%$LilFishFart> just camp in the box for saka to feed him
[2022-12-22 00:52:03] <+treebeardfarmer> CR7 would split the dressing room week 1
[2022-12-22 00:52:03] <azza_2k_> To build a good team you have to sign good as the first team if not better. That‚Äôs what city do
[2022-12-22 00:52:04] <robertcusack_97> Cr7 on a 3week contract
[2022-12-22 00:52:07] <%+fistyanan> Oh god imagine pierce Morgan ... he‚Äôs be creaming
[2022-12-22 00:52:07] <JammieDodge191> Cr7 goes against the project
[2022-12-22 00:52:10] <abiro_0> as a neutral, mbappe to arsenal would be legendary
[2022-12-22 00:52:12] <leunamand> I don't like Ronaldo for the dressing room atmosphere
[2022-12-22 00:52:12] <Rhysmead1> Would be a horrible idea imo to bring him in, would completely ruin the harmony that arteta has managed to get
[2022-12-22 00:52:12] <%+Supplecactus> Ronaldo or Giroud as a plan B Nep?
[2022-12-22 00:52:12] <+Wissco> ronaldo plays like aubameyang... he would be dreadful for us
[2022-12-22 00:52:13] <m4nny1403> Jonathan David ?
[2022-12-22 00:52:14] <%$lfcplz> Arteta didn't want Auba, no way he'd ever want CR7
[2022-12-22 00:52:20] <jackovx> he targets Copa America
[2022-12-22 00:52:28] <jackovx> 50/50 for WC
[2022-12-22 00:52:29] <%+keisarikivi> 6 world cups is mad
[2022-12-22 00:52:29] <princehairry> xhaka and cr7 on the same team LUL
[2022-12-22 00:52:29] <AbdulTarar> imagine messi goes back to back
[2022-12-22 00:52:30] <papatr0lll> Chat I‚Äôm new to fifa I have like 25k coins or wtv only what should I do with them if I want better strikers for ultimate team
[2022-12-22 00:52:37] <%$LilFishFart> i think copa and wc qualifying
[2022-12-22 00:52:49] <%+DirtyDishFC> So Messi plays in MLS before World Cup. That is 100% US marketing strategy.
[2022-12-22 00:52:50] <chrisd_95> He should retire realistically, end on a high idolised
[2022-12-22 00:52:50] <%Creativename_> Messi doesn't rely on his fitness either
[2022-12-22 00:52:50] <%$lfcplz> honestly think Messi would be better going out on a. high and retiring from Argentina
[2022-12-22 00:52:51] <%jjaden10> That‚Äôs why I‚Äôd take cr7 and Chelsea, he could easily score 10 goals in this Chelsea team who‚Äôs top scorer last year was Mount with 11
[2022-12-22 00:52:52] <robertcusack_97> Messi at Chicago fire
[2022-12-22 00:52:53] <%+nepenthez121> messi & thiago almada at atlanta united would be fire ... but i know he's going miami
[2022-12-22 00:52:53] <MickeysIce> Messi and CR7 eventually to MLS retirement home
[2022-12-22 00:52:56] <%+keisarikivi> Brazil winning in 2026, Endrick 20yr, Vini and a lot of others in their Prime
[2022-12-22 00:52:56] <%$LilFishFart> messi not even top 30 in ballon dor
[2022-12-22 00:52:56] <ninad1997> Next wc in us also

[2022-12-22 00:53:00] <+JamesMcgreavey> I‚Äôd love to see messi go back to Barca for a season
[2022-12-22 00:53:02] <+Natty1904> maybe you would

[2022-12-22 00:53:09] <%kev_theo> Do you think Arteta will stay if Barca come knocking at the door?
[2022-12-22 00:53:10] <%+Kieran96cfc> Cr7 just gonna go to saudi and be forgotten about
[2022-12-22 00:53:13] <+hibbert_gg> penalties
[2022-12-22 00:53:16] <abiro_0> USA will take the Copa America Kappa
[2022-12-22 00:53:21] <+Bigshakk> I mean Ronaldo is the Champions league GOAT
[2022-12-22 00:53:27] <%$istreet98> But does 6 months in their late 30s define whos better over the 10 years of their prime?
[2022-12-22 00:53:33] <ZombiePlant> @JamesMcgreavey Yea, Messi + Lewandowski would be something interesting to see
[2022-12-22 00:53:33] <%ando1977> Ronaldo is older so I still think their equal
[2022-12-22 00:53:33] <+Mxtsoe> many of messi's goals were just pens tho
[2022-12-22 00:53:35] <AbdulTarar> @Bigshakk Messi is gonna beat his goal record
[2022-12-22 00:53:36] <%+keisarikivi> can't be in a GOAT convo without a WC win i'm afraid
[2022-12-22 00:53:37] <doctorahmedd> CHAT is there prime icon Moments this year?
[2022-12-22 00:53:37] <+treebeardfarmer> CR7 is self sabotaging the ending of his career
[2022-12-22 00:53:38] <%+DirtyDishFC> Messi> Ronaldo BUT Euros is harder than World Cup for me (Im American FWIW)
[2022-12-22 00:53:39] <jackovx> fun fact Maradona never won Copa
[2022-12-22 00:53:40] <azza_2k_> Messi won a World Cup at 35, ronaldo 38 and still trying lmao
[2022-12-22 00:53:41] <%+nepenthez121> so what maradona & pele still ahead of CR7?
[2022-12-22 00:53:53] <+samm_786> Ever since messi scored them 91 goals in a calendar year he‚Äôs been the goat for me
[2022-12-22 00:54:00] <%+MARVELLOO> @istreet98 no it just makes people finally realize messi has always been better
[2022-12-22 00:54:00] <Naetep> no it doesnt lol
[2022-12-22 00:54:02] <%+keisarikivi> yes @NepentheZ CR7 ain't top 5 oat
[2022-12-22 00:54:02] <jester23y> Pele #2 Maradona #3
[2022-12-22 00:54:03] <%Creativename_> Ronaldo has given Portugal their only 2 trophies, Messi has added like 2 to Argentinas 19 I think
[2022-12-22 00:54:05] <+Bigshakk> I mean I just respect cr7s ability to do it across various leagues in the world
[2022-12-22 00:54:08] <+shaqhinds03> vamosLeo vamosMessi vamosLeo vamosMessi vamosLeo vamosMessi vamosLeo vamosMessi vamosLeo vamosMessi vamosLeo vamosMessi vamosMessi vamosLeo vamosMessi vamosMessi
[2022-12-22 00:54:08] <%+Supplecactus> What about Depay Nep?
[2022-12-22 00:54:08] <papatr0lll> Haaland or Mbappe @nepenthez
[2022-12-22 00:54:10] <%+keisarikivi> @nepenthez121 I mean
[2022-12-22 00:54:10] <Drakkerz> But its silly thinking its easier to win a world cup for Portugal, Argentina Brazil etc have more football culture
[2022-12-22 00:54:12] <here4rewards_> as a United fan I always gravitated towards Messi
[2022-12-22 00:54:22] <+SirTrumpet> Where do you guys see Musiala in the future?
[2022-12-22 00:54:25] <jackovx> that had to be like Championship Manager days
[2022-12-22 00:54:28] <jackovx> damn
[2022-12-22 00:54:29] <Naetep> ronaldo single handedly change the way footballers treat their physical and mental health
[2022-12-22 00:54:37] <%+DirtyDishFC> Euros is harder to win for e than World Cup.
[2022-12-22 00:54:38] <Naetep> ronaldo has had a bigger impact on football than messi
[2022-12-22 00:54:40] <c1dotloose> using ronaldo's age is a terrible excuse
[2022-12-22 00:54:44] <%+nepenthez121> he hurt us when he was at united.
[2022-12-22 00:54:44] <+husseinakif> hhhh
[2022-12-22 00:54:45] <+cjd21> Messi won't spit his dummy out when he starts to naturally decline in form though
[2022-12-22 00:54:47] <AbdulTarar> @Naetep too bad Messi is better
[2022-12-22 00:54:48] <9koLFC> some would say it was Nep who discovered Cristiano Ronaldo
[2022-12-22 00:54:54] <Wqlly> lol
[2022-12-22 00:54:57] <jackovx> @DirtyDishFC 2016 was already 24 teams so nah]
[2022-12-22 00:54:57] <%ando1977> Argentina are a better team than Portugal though. 1 player doesn‚Äôt make a team. Look at Croatia, no huge players just a good overall team
[2022-12-22 00:54:59] <chrisd_95> Bit of a pr*ck outside of football though isn‚Äôt he
[2022-12-22 00:55:05] <+husseinakif> scouts used football manager at that days

[2022-12-22 00:55:09] <hzvz> disagree. Portugal can't be compared to Argentina
[2022-12-22 00:55:10] <mufasasimba69> Pele
[2022-12-22 00:55:13] <Glacier_b> Messi is the greatest, still a debate who¬¥s the better player imo.
[2022-12-22 00:55:15] <+Natty1904> what if cr7 won this world cup?
[2022-12-22 00:55:18] <%blazer33x> does it matter who the Goat is?
[2022-12-22 00:55:18] <%+Kieran96cfc> Messi carried an average Argentina team aswell
[2022-12-22 00:55:19] <%m3elv1n> pele has 3
[2022-12-22 00:55:20] <ajjarred26> @ando1977 no cup for argentina without messi. portugal play better without cr7
[2022-12-22 00:55:23] <here4rewards_> especially how influential Messi was in their WC win
[2022-12-22 00:55:23] <jamzyxv> Messi has been the goat since 2014 but people cant accept it
[2022-12-22 00:55:23] <azza_2k_> Messi carried Argentina as well pretty much and stepped up
[2022-12-22 00:55:24] <maurice1117> World Cup ends the debate
[2022-12-22 00:55:24] <Naetep> i guess then gotze is a goat lol
[2022-12-22 00:55:33] <lustreamz> Messi has and always been the better player
[2022-12-22 00:55:34] <%Creativename_> When Ronaldo won the euros, everyone was saying you didn't need a international trophy to be the goat..
[2022-12-22 00:55:34] <m4nny1403> Messi carried
[2022-12-22 00:55:34] <%$istreet98> Argentina have been to 2 of the last 3 finals
[2022-12-22 00:55:36] <+theirishbeardedpirate> @cjd21 Messi retired a few times from International football so don't forget that
[2022-12-22 00:55:37] <jackovx> nah i say only 4 years
[2022-12-22 00:55:38] <%therealcathal> on paper Portugal much better player for player
[2022-12-22 00:55:38] <+CarlBildtThisCity> but if the WC is the decider to be a GOAT does that mean a player from a small country cant be a GOAT?
[2022-12-22 00:55:39] <Stevennguyen8> nep u do not think messi was the GOAT prior to the WC?
[2022-12-22 00:55:40] <AbdulTarar> @Naetep say that again without crying
[2022-12-22 00:55:43] <+Bigshakk> Its not Messi carried the shit out of them
[2022-12-22 00:55:43] <swfc_haden> Nep speaking facts
[2022-12-22 00:55:44] <%+jaythemillerman> cr7, bale, Messi, hazard etc been brilliant to watch over the years. I don't have an opinion on goats because every player has different qualities
[2022-12-22 00:55:44] <%+Kieran96cfc> its not, Portugals team is way better
[2022-12-22 00:55:44] <ninad1997> My goat is giroud
[2022-12-22 00:55:47] <+Renny_G> The best nations win the World Cup. Not the best player.
[2022-12-22 00:55:47] <abiro_0> i am a manchester united fan and a portuguese citizen. yet even i can see past penaldos delusions, he only scores tap ins and shouts siu a lot. the real goat is the little boy from rosario, open your eyes people.
[2022-12-22 00:55:48] <%+kingnovakin> Carried by Messi so hard this world cup
[2022-12-22 00:55:49] <%$LilFishFart> no
[2022-12-22 00:55:50] <+pumpin_the_guns1> If you look at Ronaldo‚Äôs stats from 2 seasons ago though it evens it up massively.
[2022-12-22 00:55:50] <jamiemayss> Current Portugal team is better than current Argentina
[2022-12-22 00:55:53] <jackovx> Cristiano also had rotten luck with his generation
[2022-12-22 00:55:53] <%$cc1883fc> Portugals squad is better than Argentinas
[2022-12-22 00:55:54] <%+jamesob2903> The people who say it can‚Äôt be used are the same people who would use it if CR7 had won it to say why he‚Äôs better
[2022-12-22 00:55:55] <+Bigshakk> they get knocked out in groups
[2022-12-22 00:55:56] <hzvz> it is second Messis final
[2022-12-22 00:55:57] <MickeysIce> Portugal won Euro's recently
[2022-12-22 00:55:57] <+Bigshakk> without messi
[2022-12-22 00:55:57] <%ando1977> @ajjarred26 disagree.
[2022-12-22 00:55:57] <Naetep> without the 5 pens lol
[2022-12-22 00:55:58] <+sergibonga> Portugal won the euros with Eder
[2022-12-22 00:56:02] <dangoodwin1> And Martinez
[2022-12-22 00:56:02] <PhunkMF> at least on paper Portugal team looks better than the Argentina one, no?
[2022-12-22 00:56:03] <here4rewards_> Portugal have world class players in every position
[2022-12-22 00:56:03] <+zappinho157> Portugal has so many young talents
[2022-12-22 00:56:04] <%simplefifayt> Portugal squad way better
[2022-12-22 00:56:04] <+shootersshoot473> they don't win without martinez
[2022-12-22 00:56:04] <PhilipNMx> Look where most of the players in the Argentina squad play at club level.
[2022-12-22 00:56:05] <robertcusack_97> In 2018 it was dybala higuin and messi
[2022-12-22 00:56:08] <Rickz1999> Argentina without messi would not have the refs help lmao
[2022-12-22 00:56:09] <%m3elv1n> argetnina has 4x the population
[2022-12-22 00:56:11] <+timmynlane> Salt bae carried
[2022-12-22 00:56:11] <dangoodwin1> Don‚Äôt forget Martinez
[2022-12-22 00:56:12] <mufasasimba69> Without 5 pems
[2022-12-22 00:56:12] <bigceo_37> All for money rigged world cup
[2022-12-22 00:56:13] <Xajsz> only the best of the best win the WC but this Argentina team has stinkers in it?
[2022-12-22 00:56:14] <+bamborinoo> so what about mbappe he won the wc at 18 and nearly another one
[2022-12-22 00:56:15] <kyleknoeppel> Agreed, Portugal is nasty but needed to play Leao
[2022-12-22 00:56:15] <thejoker394> 118 international goals deserves a world cup
[2022-12-22 00:56:17] <jackovx> like in the peak of his powers that portuguese crop was mid at best
[2022-12-22 00:56:17] <+jordxn_321> Take Martinez out and they already lost
[2022-12-22 00:56:19] <%Creativename_> scored 5 pens?
[2022-12-22 00:56:19] <maurice1117> favourite player doesn't mean goat, you just like cr7 more
[2022-12-22 00:56:19] <%$istreet98> Look what portugal achieved before Ronaldo, they we're no one
[2022-12-22 00:56:21] <%ando1977> I think Argentina win it without Messi
[2022-12-22 00:56:21] <+theirishbeardedpirate> They don't win without Martinez
[2022-12-22 00:56:22] <ajjarred26> literally portugal won 6-1 without ronaldo @ando1977
[2022-12-22 00:56:25] <+liampj78> only the best of the best win the world cup, then I would think Pele is the best of all time. Messi is second.
[2022-12-22 00:56:26] <+whufcconnor> Payet injured him
[2022-12-22 00:56:27] <c1dotloose> it doesn't change anything just use your eyes, it's that simple, messi is clear from the start
[2022-12-22 00:56:29] <AbdulTarar> Messi won the world cup and Ronaldo got benched for the knockout games, it's embarrassing
[2022-12-22 00:56:29] <+whufcconnor> Eder scored
[2022-12-22 00:56:29] <Rickz1999> EDERRR
[2022-12-22 00:56:29] <Stevennguyen8> Portugal team is stacked
[2022-12-22 00:56:29] <%+keisarikivi> Eder
[2022-12-22 00:56:30] <sorarejosh> Argentina without Messi woulda been lucky to better than Spain
[2022-12-22 00:56:30] <stennnnnnnnnnnnnnnn> eder
[2022-12-22 00:56:30] <%+Kieran96cfc> Eder

[2022-12-22 00:56:30] <%+toxiiczo> eder
[2022-12-22 00:56:31] <Glacier_b> Ronaldo basically had one go, maybe two, Argentina have been good for all 5 of Messi¬¥s runs

[2022-12-22 00:56:35] <mikegreenyt> eder
[2022-12-22 00:56:35] <%m3elv1n> ronaldo carried portugal to the final
[2022-12-22 00:56:36] <%+jjw98__> Eder
[2022-12-22 00:56:37] <adriantheimert> But they were in the final because of Ronaldo
[2022-12-22 00:56:38] <+CarlBildtThisCity> EDER
[2022-12-22 00:56:39] <mufasasimba69> He carried
[2022-12-22 00:56:39] <+ibster10> Ronaldo carried Portugal to that euros lmaoooo
[2022-12-22 00:56:39] <steele1921> So many deluded opinions in the chat. Why can‚Äôt we just appreciate both players?
[2022-12-22 00:56:41] <%+DirtyDishFC> HGH though KEKW
[2022-12-22 00:56:41] <lozzer360> I think knockout type tournaments have an element of luck too
[2022-12-22 00:56:41] <yoo_andrew> But Ronaldo  carried that team to the final
[2022-12-22 00:56:42] <%$cc1883fc> they also won it by winning 1 game in 90 minutes
[2022-12-22 00:56:42] <Naetep> payet took him out
[2022-12-22 00:56:43] <%+jaythemillerman> I personally don't like the goat debate. every single play is different and has different qualities
[2022-12-22 00:56:45] <%+nepenthez121> I think it was ronaldos ego that got in the way again. He would've started every game if he didnt stir things up.
[2022-12-22 00:56:46] <Sezar93> what a brain-dead take from that guy
[2022-12-22 00:56:50] <%+csmacph_> Eder went missing after that goal
[2022-12-22 00:56:50] <hzvz> withou cr7 portugal not even play in final
[2022-12-22 00:56:50] <+moreganfreakman> that's a shit take
[2022-12-22 00:56:51] <dropluckop> Cr7 carried Portugal that year
[2022-12-22 00:56:54] <azza_2k_> Messi scored 5 pens is such a bad argument. He missed a pen in copa america and was laughed at saying he choked
[2022-12-22 00:56:54] <nero_182> What an interesting conversation between these 2. Love it!
[2022-12-22 00:56:55] <ifbbsami> Dont know How People Compared Ronaldo with messi ... messi is just LEVELS ABOVE ALL
[2022-12-22 00:56:55] <DavyeBee24> And if it wasnt for ronaldo scoring 2 agianst bulgaria and wales they wouldnt have won it
[2022-12-22 00:56:56] <dangoodwin1> If it wasn‚Äôt for Martinez they wouldn‚Äôt have the copa America and World Cup. Just FACTS
[2022-12-22 00:56:57] <ifbbsami> EDER
[2022-12-22 00:56:59] <+SirTrumpet> btw. gameplay is really nice
[2022-12-22 00:57:02] <%xWhispy> Portugal are held back bu their manager more than anything
[2022-12-22 00:57:02] <Rickz1999> EDER just spawned to score that goal
[2022-12-22 00:57:05] <%+keisarikivi> Portugal drew all of their GS games and only won Wales in 90 mins LOL
[2022-12-22 00:57:06] <ben032005> Who carried them to the final though. The other guy talking knows nothing
[2022-12-22 00:57:06] <%m3elv1n> ronaldo got portugal out of the group and to the final
[2022-12-22 00:57:09] VIEWERS: 2¬†092
[2022-12-22 00:57:10] <ajjarred26> portugal play so much better without cr7
[2022-12-22 00:57:11] <leunamand> Eder couldn't even believe that goal LUL
[2022-12-22 00:57:12] <+simonaus21> Yeah but Portugal wouldnt of even got to the final without Ronaldo
[2022-12-22 00:57:14] <%+csmacph_> Guess w
[2022-12-22 00:57:15] <jackovx> Copa definitely
[2022-12-22 00:57:19] <+BandidoxD> PORTUGAL LACKS HUMILITY AS A SQUAD, MOST PLAYERS UNDERPERFORM ON OUT NT, THERE IS NO CHEM BETWEEN THEM

[2022-12-22 00:57:20] <+sergibonga> Di Maria carried
[2022-12-22 00:57:23] <+moreganfreakman> Di Maria
[2022-12-22 00:57:24] <jackovx> he won that shootout v colombia
[2022-12-22 00:57:24] <Glacier_b> Martinez won that game, the last minute save
[2022-12-22 00:57:33] <%+Kieran96cfc> Di maria carried that final
[2022-12-22 00:57:36] <%+csmacph_> Guess how portugal won the euros? CR7 was on the bench
[2022-12-22 00:57:39] <+CarlBildtThisCity> Considering its mostly EU teams in WC late games, is it THAT big difference between winning WC and Euros?
[2022-12-22 00:57:40] <nero_182> @Glacier_b Aids save that was
[2022-12-22 00:57:41] <%+nepenthez121> yeah you need a keeper with cojones in net for pens
[2022-12-22 00:57:42] <Rickz1999> messi is just one more argentina player, in history ronaldo is portugal's full history
[2022-12-22 00:57:45] <abiro_0> di maria went to past and peaked
[2022-12-22 00:57:45] <azza_2k_> Di Maria was the difference in final tbf, they missed him in 2014 as was injured
[2022-12-22 00:57:45] <+samm_786> Alvarez was huge for them this World Cup
[2022-12-22 00:57:46] <ifbbsami> Messi Scored Most goals and Most assist in Copa
[2022-12-22 00:57:48] <ninad1997> I would say its  50 -50   Martinez deserved his credits
[2022-12-22 00:57:52] <+Africs10> i cant agree with that. messi won a worl cup with argentina,  a country that has won it 3 times, the only trophys portugal won where with Ronaldo. Messi is amazing,  but won 2 ballons dor that came out of nowhere. ronaldo is the true goat
[2022-12-22 00:57:55] <sorarejosh> Let‚Äôs remember enzo didn‚Äôt even start at the beginning of tourney
[2022-12-22 00:57:56] <+moreganfreakman> but a shit couch
[2022-12-22 00:57:57] <correia301> is completly different to win on Argentina team or win on Portugal team. Just go look how many mundials and euros was portugal in before Ronaldo. 3-4... After Ronaldo, Portugal reached all final stages. What about Argentina? They are always a cronic potential winner, so its much easier. Is like playing on Real Madrid or on Valencia. Valencia win 1 time in 100y, Real Madrid wins everytime, thats Argentina vs portugal
[2022-12-22 00:57:57] <caretakerrrrr> Love winning the draft without getting a single board!
[2022-12-22 00:57:58] <%+keisarikivi> Portugal on paper was the best team this WC
[2022-12-22 00:58:02] <ajjarred26> Alvarez is gonna be sooooooo goooooddddd
[2022-12-22 00:58:03] <Glacier_b> @nero_182 It was the clutch moment in that game
[2022-12-22 00:58:06] <%kev_theo> Do you think Martinez is to big for Aston Villa now?
[2022-12-22 00:58:06] <%$istreet98> Muapay won Messi the world cup
[2022-12-22 00:58:07] <truegooner_27> Argentina's spirit and fight got them through most games

[2022-12-22 00:58:09] <Yhuc> leao
[2022-12-22 00:58:10] <galligz1994> It was fixed where was the French team that played England ?
[2022-12-22 00:58:10] <Sezar93> Garbage manger though
[2022-12-22 00:58:11] <AbdulTarar> all the Ronaldo fanboys coping, it's over
[2022-12-22 00:58:12] <opaza01> Martinez saved Argentina and Costa made the mistake for Portugal
[2022-12-22 00:58:13] <jackovx> 2nd most talented crop this WC
[2022-12-22 00:58:13] <+sergibonga> Portugal also didn‚Äôt get 6 pens in 7 games
[2022-12-22 00:58:13] <cfc_Ray19> portugal team is better but Argentina have a better system
[2022-12-22 00:58:15] <%+jaythemillerman> that picture with golden glove haha. and he played at my team on loan from arsenal (Rotherham)
[2022-12-22 00:58:16] <%+azza_shergill> Felix and leao
[2022-12-22 00:58:17] <+theirishbeardedpirate> Flashback a few years when Messi retired a few times and Cr7 won the euros the debate was different.  Even Messis first year at Psg people said he was finished and Cr7 was better but not anymore.   Time flies in football
[2022-12-22 00:58:17] <%+Arkuvio> Rafael Leao
[2022-12-22 00:58:17] <jackovx> portugal
[2022-12-22 00:58:18] <AsickJoke> He also got unlucky with higiuain miss, Messi could have 2 world cups
[2022-12-22 00:58:19] <Naetep> CR7 has inspired the youth to take care of their bodies and mental health.
[2022-12-22 00:58:23] <m4nny1403> Felix
[2022-12-22 00:58:23] <+Pughy30> Argentina are good but Molina and Tagliafico are hardly Cafu and Carlos
[2022-12-22 00:58:23] <%+stackmillz> maccalister played lights out that whole touney and he plays for brighton
[2022-12-22 00:58:24] <MickeysIce> Rafael Le√£o
[2022-12-22 00:58:24] <%+Kieran96cfc> like 3 of argentinas team get into portugals
[2022-12-22 00:58:24] <m4nny1403> Leao
[2022-12-22 00:58:29] <+kenny_fung> As a Wolves fan, if Portugal are that good, why are we so bad...
[2022-12-22 00:58:29] <hzvz> they are too young
[2022-12-22 00:58:29] <galligz1994> How comes france played like they did against Tunisia in the final
[2022-12-22 00:58:32] <+pumpin_the_guns1> Better individuals but not as a team I‚Äôd say.
[2022-12-22 00:58:35] <TekkersJR> I was saying the same thing to myself.
[2022-12-22 00:58:37] <AbdulTarar> @Naetep Ronaldo also inspired the youth to not misbehave with women
[2022-12-22 00:58:37] <correia301> this was the most rigged World Cup EVER. FACTS
[2022-12-22 00:58:42] <+whufcconnor> erm josh?
[2022-12-22 00:58:42] <nero_182> @Naetep Amen
[2022-12-22 00:58:46] <+Africs10> portugal  had a dumb ass for a coach
[2022-12-22 00:58:46] <lozzer360> I think you cant forget its not messi fc and Ronaldo fc its argentina and portugal not all about them

[2022-12-22 00:58:49] <jackovx> the rigged guys are funny
[2022-12-22 00:58:49] <yoo_andrew> Agreed I‚Äôm Portuguese but lets not act Portugal has had a better team than Argentina for 8-10 years like you said lol
[2022-12-22 00:58:53] <abiro_0> that 6-1 over swiss for portugal inflated them a lot
[2022-12-22 00:58:57] <Glacier_b> Argentina had a fairly easy run though, the better side of the bracket and didn¬¥t have to face Brazil
[2022-12-22 00:59:00] <+timmynlane> The morocco game was sus v portugal
[2022-12-22 00:59:00] <Naetep> without CR7 there wouldnt be mbappe and haaland.
[2022-12-22 00:59:01] <galligz1994> And otamendi plays for who
[2022-12-22 00:59:03] <+moreganfreakman> you're just overhyped true

[2022-12-22 00:59:18] <+theirishbeardedpirate> Argentina 100% do not win without Martinez but that doesn't belittle how good Messi played
[2022-12-22 00:59:18] <steele1921> @correia301 Get your deluded head out of the clouds and wake up. You have any idea how much organisation it would take to ‚Äúrig‚Äù a World Cup?

[2022-12-22 00:59:27] <sorarejosh> That was Brazils downfall too , their fullbacks let down the rest of team

[2022-12-22 00:59:39] <%$istreet98> Portugal we're no one before Ronaldo. Can't underscript what he's done for them
[2022-12-22 00:59:40] <opaza01> doesnt change the fact that the Argentina players outperformed the "stars" at Portugal

[2022-12-22 00:59:43] <+whufcconnor> Swansea he was awful
[2022-12-22 00:59:48] <Naetep> @Naetep it frustrates that no one talks about this. no other player has had a bigger impact on football than cr7.
[2022-12-22 00:59:49] <AbdulTarar> Renato has been awful, don't compare him to Enzo
[2022-12-22 00:59:50] <%+jjw98__> Renato wasn‚Äôt even called up

[2022-12-22 01:00:12] <jackovx> respect benfica this year tho
[2022-12-22 01:00:12] <correia301> @steele1921 as much as deciding where will be the next worldcup. dont be naive. Money buys evertyhing. FIFA is the most corrupt football institution
[2022-12-22 01:00:17] <yoo_andrew> @keisarikivi 8-10 years ago Portugal didn‚Äôt make it out the group stage of the World Cup lol
[2022-12-22 01:00:20] <jackovx> they gave it to psg
[2022-12-22 01:00:21] <Rickz1999> Pessi?
[2022-12-22 01:00:24] <+jamietwitch_> I'd have emi Martinez over lloris and he plays for villa, not always the case
[2022-12-22 01:00:28] <swfc_haden> Ronaldo was the  manager
[2022-12-22 01:00:28] <m4nny1403> But they wouldn‚Äôt of get there if he didn‚Äôt though
[2022-12-22 01:00:32] <%+jaythemillerman> Di Maria rolled back the years
[2022-12-22 01:00:32] <jackovx> great tactical move
[2022-12-22 01:00:33] <hzvz> if u compare names. England much better tham Argentina

[2022-12-22 01:00:45] <+sj1718> Di Maria was class hence the card
[2022-12-22 01:00:47] <dangoodwin1> De Paul was great. He needs a move to the prem 10000%
[2022-12-22 01:00:51] <azza_2k_> Di Maria didn‚Äôt roll back tears, he‚Äôs always been a big game player
[2022-12-22 01:00:54] <marketmaestro> the di maria pen wasnt a penalty
[2022-12-22 01:00:55] <azza_2k_> Years
[2022-12-22 01:00:59] <abiro_0> messi was actually trying to defend
[2022-12-22 01:00:59] <%+Kieran96cfc> scored the 3rd goal aswell right?
[2022-12-22 01:01:00] <%$LilFishFart> di maria and de paul
[2022-12-22 01:01:01] <+sergibonga> If Ronaldo performs like messi in that final he gets called Penaldo instead of getting praised

[2022-12-22 01:01:07] <ninad1997> Fun fact loris was awful in both final in euro and wc

[2022-12-22 01:01:10] <Rickz1999> if portugal had won with that many pens, the world would be all on top of him, because its messi no one says nothing
[2022-12-22 01:01:11] <robertcusack_97> In 2018 they only played with Messi in 2022 they play with Messi

[2022-12-22 01:01:13] <@%AaronBrookes94> What I said on the day, while yes that defender should've been on Di Maria for Argentina's second, he saves a bit of face because who the hell expected Di Maria to turn into his prime to get on the end of the pass?
[2022-12-22 01:01:14] <+CarlBildtThisCity> making 1 good pass dont make iot a good game for him
[2022-12-22 01:01:14] <earvillage> Don't really think Messi carried the team throughout the majority of the games. He just walked around on the pitch and scored pens. However, he showed up in the semis and final.
[2022-12-22 01:01:21] <princehairry> LUL
[2022-12-22 01:01:21] <%KKAAMMUU> messi even tracked back in the final and got some balls back

[2022-12-22 01:01:27] <+grem1983> Argentina had a Brighton and Villa player in there team! That says it all really
[2022-12-22 01:01:27] <%+DirtyDishFC> I wonder if Messi and Di Maria do as well if WC was after a full season and not at the beginning caus of their age
[2022-12-22 01:01:30] <Stevennguyen8> @earvillage that is such an L comment
[2022-12-22 01:01:33] <Naetep> CR7 and Messi are equally the Goats
[2022-12-22 01:01:34] <+geosb> I can see Ronaldo playing in the 2026 World Cup
[2022-12-22 01:01:34] <%fifa_mikek> argentina had a better team spirit, morale and desire in comparison to portugal
[2022-12-22 01:01:37] <%+Supplecactus> Still can‚Äôt believe France got to the final. Easily could of lost twice
[2022-12-22 01:01:40] <%+keisarikivi> 2016 Ronaldo scored 3 goals, drew all of their GS games and finished 3rd, only won Wales in 90 mins, how can yall say he carried lol. Nani and Quaresma >>
[2022-12-22 01:01:40] <DavyeBee24> @hazzat1345 Agreed
[2022-12-22 01:01:42] <AbdulTarar> the fact that the debate has turned from Messi vs Ronaldo to Portugal and their history shows that the goat debate is over
[2022-12-22 01:01:44] <yoo_andrew> If Ronaldo scores penalties he gets hate but Messi scores he gets praise weird
[2022-12-22 01:01:44] <dropluckop> Cr7 the goat üêê
[2022-12-22 01:01:46] <kingkurdo00> LORIS IS THE BEST GOALKEEPER ON EARTH
[2022-12-22 01:01:46] <1only007> messi gave the ball away that led to a goal
[2022-12-22 01:01:49] <dangoodwin1> Who does your mate support? Curious
[2022-12-22 01:01:50] <+jamietwitch_> messi for me is the greatest but it's not nice too see Ronaldo get so much hate he's given a lot too football
[2022-12-22 01:01:50] <%+jjw98__> Josh who do you support mate?
[2022-12-22 01:01:51] <ajjarred26> @AaronBrookes94 Di Maria in finals is gameover mate. man shows tf up
[2022-12-22 01:01:57] <Rickz1999> and tbh the teams argentina faced were so dead lol
[2022-12-22 01:02:03] <senatordreams> Nep youre clear of pie
[2022-12-22 01:02:06] <+JamesMcgreavey> @earvillage he literally scored in the RO16 quarters semis and final and was 1 off the golden boot and got the most assists
[2022-12-22 01:02:07] <AbdulTarar> @yoo_andrew because Ronaldo scored 0 non pen goals at the world cup lmao
[2022-12-22 01:02:08] <senatordreams> i love you
[2022-12-22 01:02:10] <jackovx> @jamietwitch_ its fueled also by ronaldo stans
[2022-12-22 01:02:11] <abiro_0> @1only007 out muscled unfort
[2022-12-22 01:02:15] <%+michael2ooo> Ronaldo getting too much disrespect atm even that chant at the game tonight was a joke
[2022-12-22 01:02:15] <+donsanchez10> He was beautiful he was the point of difference  He has always been the point of difference  Unparalleled and maybe today there will of course always be those who argue always be those who debate and the debate can rage on if you like But as he falls in love with the object in the world his heart most desired It is hard to scape this opposition that he has rendered himself today The greatest of all time
[2022-12-22 01:02:16] <Rickz1999> @JamesMcgreavey Pessi?
[2022-12-22 01:02:17] <robertcusack_97> If Ronaldo play in 2026 Portugal aren't winning for a fact
[2022-12-22 01:02:21] <leunamand> @jamietwitch_ His personality doesn't help that cause
[2022-12-22 01:02:23] <%+keisarikivi> @Rickz1999 Croatia who beat Brazil, silver medalists in 2018? Netherlands? FRANCE?
[2022-12-22 01:02:25] <ninad1997> Fun fact: Argentina would have won the wc in 2014 only if higuan was benched for some good @nepenthez

[2022-12-22 01:02:28] <Stevennguyen8> im sorry to all the cr7 fans but u can have your favourite player but if ur talking about GOATs its over
[2022-12-22 01:02:37] <+whufcconnor> @ojaxson no x
[2022-12-22 01:02:41] <nero_182> @ojaxson now?
[2022-12-22 01:02:41] <Rickz1999> pens all game
[2022-12-22 01:02:44] <%$coys51> @ojaxson no
[2022-12-22 01:02:44] <%KKAAMMUU> @ojaxson fuck that
[2022-12-22 01:02:47] <yoo_andrew> @abdultarar and how many non pens did Messi score? Like 2
[2022-12-22 01:02:47] <senatordreams> lads di maria in finals is basically a different player, phenomenal
[2022-12-22 01:02:48] <abiro_0> KDB is my Goat CAM
[2022-12-22 01:02:51] <warrent06> I think it's crazy on how if psg win nothing this season Messi would probably still win the Ballond'or
[2022-12-22 01:02:51] <Rickz1999> random pens tho, not once a clear pen
[2022-12-22 01:02:53] <+JamesMcgreavey> @rickz1999 üêê*
[2022-12-22 01:02:59] <+CarlBildtThisCity> IMO national games dont make a difference to "GOAT". With that reasoning a player from a "small/bad/ country could never become the "GOAT"
[2022-12-22 01:03:00] <AleksanderVK> @ojaxson no thanks
[2022-12-22 01:03:03] <+jamietwitch_> people should respect them both irrespective of their status as the best of all time
[2022-12-22 01:03:06] <%+dtf1325> how to settle the messi cr7 argument. MESSI COMPLETED FOOTBALL.
[2022-12-22 01:03:13] <AbdulTarar> @yoo_andrew yeah, thats 2 more than Ronaldo has in his entire world cup career in the knockouts

[2022-12-22 01:03:20] <%+Supplecactus> Seeing prime icons are out tomorrow. Great, can‚Äôt wait to pack none of them like the other non existent icons  ive not packed in any normal packs this year
[2022-12-22 01:03:27] <opaza01> what? both France pen were crystal clear
[2022-12-22 01:03:28] <saalund> but, are you playing good in matches ? are you are genius in matches ? when you walk around for 85min? serious.  I Mean, of course he did 4-5 key thing, in every match, but, if you look at Di Maria, Fern√°ndez, etc, they where so much more involved in every game. also, messi scores 5 goals on pens, and 2 in open game. Imaging if it was ronaldo. the hate he would listen too.
[2022-12-22 01:03:33] <earvillage> @JamesMcgreavey My comment literally mentioned he showed up in the semis and final...
[2022-12-22 01:03:33] <%+dtf1325> @stevennguyen8 I'm a cr7 fan tho lol
[2022-12-22 01:03:34] <%+Kieran96cfc> Soft pens doesnt mean undeserved pens
[2022-12-22 01:03:34] <%Creativename_> Everyone saying this WC makes Messi the goat, Pele surely is undeniably the goat since he has 3?
[2022-12-22 01:03:35] <jackovx> dembele pen was his stupidity. soft pens exist?
[2022-12-22 01:03:36] <+shootersshoot473> france pens ? what ?
[2022-12-22 01:03:36] <+CarlBildtThisCity> what a moron, how was the first france pen not a pen
[2022-12-22 01:03:38] <MoonboyXI> pendu fans talking about non pen goals LUL
[2022-12-22 01:03:44] <senatordreams> either way, those pens made the game more exciting, questionable pens or not idc for a neutral fan its great
[2022-12-22 01:03:48] <leunamand> I think all final pens were right and ref performed well
[2022-12-22 01:03:49] <nero_182> @saalund Agreed
[2022-12-22 01:03:49] <yoo_andrew> @abdultarar Messi scored 1 non penalty goal in the knockouts lol
[2022-12-22 01:03:51] <%+jaythemillerman> did you see Rashford goal tonight was brilliant
[2022-12-22 01:03:52] <steele1921> It genuinely baffles me how many morons believe the whole tournament was rigged for Argentina. Madness
[2022-12-22 01:03:52] <jackovx> the only fuck up ref did in final was the coman counter
[2022-12-22 01:03:53] <%+jamesob2903> Yep, he was excellent
[2022-12-22 01:03:53] <%+Kieran96cfc> That ref was brilliant the call of the dive was great
[2022-12-22 01:03:53] <%+Supplecactus> The ref in the England vs France game was the poorest for me
[2022-12-22 01:03:55] <shazik192> Not only that but these pens actually didn‚Äôt mean anything in the games, except Netherlands where it was a clear pen
[2022-12-22 01:03:56] <dropluckop> Pessi got 6 pens this wc OpieOP
[2022-12-22 01:03:56] <+Pughy30> The mental gymnastics people go through to try and downplay Messi is crazy
[2022-12-22 01:03:58] <+whufcconnor> the call on the dive was class
[2022-12-22 01:03:59] <mufasasimba69> lol
[2022-12-22 01:04:01] <Rickz1999> when ronaldo gets questionable pens, everyone calls him penaldo, when its messi carried by pen everyone looks away, thats pure facts
[2022-12-22 01:04:01] <%Mazeours> Imo messi is the player who always has done the massive carryjobs at club or national team level. Copa he had 9 g/a - wc is 10 g/a. But even messi cant carry the team all 90/120 minutes EVERY game. Otherwise he would literally be a god
[2022-12-22 01:04:03] <AbdulTarar> @yoo_andrew yeah, 1 more than Ronaldo's entire world cup career
[2022-12-22 01:04:07] <+lukaSIvI> in general it was crazy how much the refs guarded messi, he never got a yellow
[2022-12-22 01:04:09] <greenforestbear89> messi led the team by leading by example with spirit and pride
[2022-12-22 01:04:09] <leunamand> @Kieran96cfc True, he also got that right
[2022-12-22 01:04:09] <azza_2k_> Messi goal against Mexico was just the tell that they would go on to win World Cup. It was destiny
[2022-12-22 01:04:09] <opaza01> @senatordreams the first pen ruined the game as a neutral
[2022-12-22 01:04:12] <%ando1977> ü§£ not every team. The Australian vs Argentina game was the most one sided game I‚Äôve seen
[2022-12-22 01:04:12] <DavyeBee24> Hell nah, ottamendi should got booked atleast 4 times and the tackle on rabiot was a red
[2022-12-22 01:04:15] <+slang608> the argentina netherlands ref was the worst
[2022-12-22 01:04:17] <%+keisarikivi> There IS NO WAY I'm seeing Ronaldo fans talking about non penalty goals
[2022-12-22 01:04:17] <+playkingleo7> They got a pen at the start of every knockout game lol
[2022-12-22 01:04:24] <AbdulTarar> @yoo_andrew also, Messi got 2, vs australia and france, watch more football mate

[2022-12-22 01:04:24] <+CarlBildtThisCity> France first pen was 100000% a pen, not soft
[2022-12-22 01:04:26] <opaza01> Otamendi should have gotten a red
[2022-12-22 01:04:29] <+creasybutt> The pen vs poland was a joke
[2022-12-22 01:04:34] <%+bazzay10> do u think England would have beat Argentina?
[2022-12-22 01:04:36] <opaza01> fax
[2022-12-22 01:04:41] <saalund> Guys, but, are you playing good in matches ? are you are genius in matches ? when you walk around for 85min? serious.

[2022-12-22 01:04:41] <MoonboyXI> @yoo_andrew did you see the games he was he best player on the pitch in every game
[2022-12-22 01:04:42] <%$LilFishFart> the penalty against poland?
[2022-12-22 01:04:44] <SEiFElDeN999> Hater
[2022-12-22 01:04:49] <%+609blazers> his emotion got the best of him in Netherlands game you can tell
[2022-12-22 01:04:49] <+whufcconnor> 18 yellow cards weren't it?
[2022-12-22 01:04:50] <%KKAAMMUU> the ref in that game was so shit
[2022-12-22 01:04:52] <Stevennguyen8> no one talks about the pace that the players move at that any contact can bring a player doen

[2022-12-22 01:04:53] <finoallafineforzajuve> yeah the one with the hand ball was madness
[2022-12-22 01:04:53] <+shaqhinds03> But Dutch players aswell
[2022-12-22 01:04:53] <Rickz1999> paredes on netherlands shold have ben sent off 2, when he kicked the ball on to the bench
[2022-12-22 01:04:56] <%+keisarikivi> Mateu Lahoz <3
[2022-12-22 01:04:56] <finoallafineforzajuve> clear yellow
[2022-12-22 01:04:58] <jackovx> nah it was PRIME Lahoz
[2022-12-22 01:04:58] <%+koojababy10> VVD should gotten red
[2022-12-22 01:05:03] <+timmynlane> Argentina were treated lightly by all the refs
[2022-12-22 01:05:07] <%josh_rawlins21057> If Messi gets one yellow no way is he doing what he did to get booked
[2022-12-22 01:05:09] <%+aarona93> even vvd for sending that player to the showers
[2022-12-22 01:05:09] <+Cavacom> 17 yellows in that game and only 1 red (after the game ended
[2022-12-22 01:05:10] <Rickz1999> -messi -paredes on semi, rip argentina
[2022-12-22 01:05:11] <+JamesMcgreavey> @saalund but messi doesn‚Äôt just walk around he analyses the game so when he does get that chance he know exactly how much time he has to get a shot or pass off which ends up winning the game

[2022-12-22 01:05:17] <%+Kieran96cfc> every single team gets pens that shouldn't be pens

[2022-12-22 01:05:21] <yoo_andrew> @moonboyxi I wouldn‚Äôt say every game but he was very good I‚Äôm not denying that lol
[2022-12-22 01:05:22] <senatordreams> that referee in that netherlands game had no control, lets be honest he wasnt fit for a fiery game like that
[2022-12-22 01:05:25] <greenforestbear89> the team unity won them the WC
[2022-12-22 01:05:25] <%+futbolistic97> Well said Josh
[2022-12-22 01:05:30] <+ansgar_7> Six pens mate.
[2022-12-22 01:05:30] <jackovx> Argentina was a classic tournament team
[2022-12-22 01:05:32] <robertcusack_97> Benfica making bank in the summer
[2022-12-22 01:05:33] <Rickz1999> everything around the last 4 years in international football was to get messi trophies
[2022-12-22 01:05:33] <shazik192> Same as ronaldo as well over the years, he got same respect from the referees
[2022-12-22 01:05:35] <correia301> what about 5 out of 8 refs being argentinian on portugal's games?
[2022-12-22 01:05:39] <%+Supplecactus> Ref in the England vs France game has me fuming. France first goal comes from Upamecano fouling Saka

[2022-12-22 01:05:41] <%+koojababy10> Messi doesn‚Äôt get that other yellow tho if he gets that handball card
[2022-12-22 01:05:47] <abiro_0> true
[2022-12-22 01:05:50] <saalund> Argentina had 13 players on the pitch, when messi scored to 2 - 3. Corrput
[2022-12-22 01:05:51] <Messagge> wasnt it only back foot on the line
[2022-12-22 01:05:51] <%Mazeours> can you please discuss your opinion on Messi/Maradona/pele as THE goat ?
[2022-12-22 01:05:59] <jackovx> you can do a step
[2022-12-22 01:06:04] <+shorich3> a player was in a box before messi hit the ball
[2022-12-22 01:06:04] <greenforestbear89> back in the good old days there was no such thing haha
[2022-12-22 01:06:08] <+MrCurns> The refereeing all World Cup was fairly bad
[2022-12-22 01:06:09] <%+keisarikivi> bloody hell lads
[2022-12-22 01:06:18] <azza_2k_> Comparing goats from different generation makes no sense
[2022-12-22 01:06:18] <+Burns603> the best players in every major sport get refereed differently, its just the human nature of it
[2022-12-22 01:06:24] <Rickz1999> var confirmed that its not human error, its realy corruption
[2022-12-22 01:06:27] <yoo_andrew> I just don‚Äôt like how Ronaldo gets hate for scoring pens and Messi gets praise for scoring them
[2022-12-22 01:06:39] <+theirishbeardedpirate> Half the pundits don't even know
[2022-12-22 01:06:41] <%+Kieran96cfc> also the amount of people who stutter now when taking pens cant really blame a keeper for having a foot off the line
[2022-12-22 01:06:41] <%+keisarikivi> Before the pen to make it 3-3 in the Final the ball deflected off of Kolo Muanis hand for Mbappe on the edge of the box but aint nobody talking about that
[2022-12-22 01:06:42] <senatordreams> best players always get benefits, its just how it is

[2022-12-22 01:07:07] <Rickz1999> @yoo_andrew simple as that, if it was ronaldo with 4/6 goals with pens the world would be on fire now

[2022-12-22 15:07:41] <saalund> Nep, can i ask you? Because, Zwe, RTFM and so, they all HATE on squad battles. I actually think on world class and legendary its quite fun/challanging. Way more than many rivals matches. But, if you have the time, why not also do the squad battles for the coins/packs? You can get to +40k points, which gives good packs and coins in under 20 matches. I just think, why not? Whats your oppinion?

[2022-12-22 18:52:08] <%CrazyEskimoPenguin> (I know this is weird) but I actually hope we don't get them at this point. I know me, and I know I'll probably end up grinding them, but I'm quite enjoying not grinding menus this year and just doing the gameplay I enjoy (again, very weird I know)

[2022-12-22 18:52:30] <omarrashad95> But they can leak pack sbcs like the 85+ packs and stuff
[2022-12-22 18:52:32] <%+Mightynemesis29> i dont think even leagues sbcs will make this fifa more enjoyable , ea really this game down even by their standards
[2022-12-22 18:52:33] <Stallone986> league sbc has become a fifa myth/legend. its folk lore ahahah

[2022-12-22 18:52:50] <marinojab> I just can‚Äôt wait for them, I miss grinding while watching my fav streamer at the same time. Best vibes ever
[2022-12-22 18:52:50] <iZuloft> They won‚Äôt put players in as it made it too easy to complete and use for other SBCs
[2022-12-22 18:52:53] <%+thegoslow> @omarrashad95 because it has to be added, league SBCs are already there
[2022-12-22 18:52:53] <@%Viperlization> there is just nothing to grind and chill doing on fifa
[2022-12-22 18:52:57] <%+tomcivis> can you explain the LSBC grind?

[2022-12-22 19:22:17] <curtj_012> The fact they are requiring a team of the week when the has been no totw upgrades  for a while makes it alot more difficult to complete several sbc they are requiring

[2022-12-22 19:22:28] <%+clanwalk3r> How can they update the moments store with packs costing 20/35/65 tokens but not give us any more moments to do?? I have 3 and completed everything but get punished for spending them on last seasons packs??
[2022-12-22 19:22:29] <@%Viperlization> wtf
[2022-12-22 19:22:43] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> If its a "quality" card rather than "hes only as good as what Ive got" that is pushing up the power curve. This is as good as almost every left back in peoples teams.
[2022-12-22 19:22:44] <fordykyle1> marquee match ups didn't give me a token

[2022-12-22 19:23:05] <%Dezalleycat> The way they have carried on this cycle I fully expect them to announce that TOTY items will not be available in saved packs in the store
[2022-12-22 19:23:09] <jackleftdead> I got it this morning and there's another 1 big W
[2022-12-22 19:23:09] <%+2siick87> theres a ww swap tocken in the marquee matchups if you didnt know @NepentheZ
[2022-12-22 19:23:12] <%+jaythemillerman> even as an ex Rotherham player I don't want that tutu at that price
[2022-12-22 19:23:15] <+MrCatuh> lmfao this player won't get in most squads anymore cause of how ridiculous the power curve is

[2022-12-22 19:23:22] <Makezuu1> Fifa 22 had soo much better sbc. Ways to grind players, packs, picks etc. More often. Compared on Futbin and it shows how much downgrade this 23 is

[2022-12-22 19:25:03] <+goldenstrider10> world cup lol
[2022-12-22 19:25:04] <+dntblametay1989> moments is so dumb and waste of time
[2022-12-22 19:25:12] <%+kane25> means you can barely even select the rewards
[2022-12-22 19:25:13] <@%Viperlization> yeah it shoud be repeatable, of course the packs are limited
[2022-12-22 19:25:14] <+BEANZLORD> hi nep you mentioned 3 swaps tokens today but I can only see 2 the sbc and moments one which is the other one?
[2022-12-22 19:25:14] <%CrazyEskimoPenguin> new showdown feature... the winner goes up, the loser goes down lol
[2022-12-22 19:25:18] <%Creativename_> should be infinite, it's not hard just copy and paste the objectives or something
[2022-12-22 19:25:20] <@%Viperlization> so it literally doesn't matter
[2022-12-22 19:25:21] <%+Kieran96cfc> goldenstrider10 they arent releasing anymore
[2022-12-22 19:25:23] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> there should either be repeatable stars or hundreds and hundreds to get
[2022-12-22 19:25:26] <LunarRedRs> facts
[2022-12-22 19:25:29] <%Dezalleycat> Like events last year,wannnnk
[2022-12-22 19:25:30] <%+shemlaa> should be like squad battles, refresh it every week
[2022-12-22 19:25:32] <%+derrickp_13> seriously
[2022-12-22 19:25:37] <+goldenstrider10> @kieran96cfc figured thanks
[2022-12-22 19:25:38] <here4rewards_> I am lucky I have 500 stars, but it is unfair to others
[2022-12-22 19:25:41] <@%Viperlization> that could be fun tho couldnt it
[2022-12-22 19:25:41] <lazika6161> Limiting the amount of games is stupid in general
[2022-12-22 19:25:45] <%Creativename_> EA love time walls
[2022-12-22 19:25:49] <67jezza> we were meant to get 175 stars last season and got nowhere near to that
[2022-12-22 19:25:51] <woke_up_older> what's the hidden challenge in moments?
[2022-12-22 19:25:52] <@%Viperlization> "I OPENED 100 Premium Gold Packs from Moments"
[2022-12-22 19:25:52] <+kenny_fung> Similar to draft
[2022-12-22 19:26:00] <+darkheist8819> and you have to open them on the spot. you cant even store them
[2022-12-22 19:26:02] <%+derrickp_13> its basically like tokens only select some things
[2022-12-22 19:26:03] <%hughr1983> I use my stars for drafts
[2022-12-22 19:26:03] VIEWERS: 3¬†610
[2022-12-22 19:26:04] <%+clanwalk3r> 100% agree!! having limited tokens but a store with lots of packs you can't even get is awful design!!
[2022-12-22 19:26:06] <+jackdoni> Personally, I think moments should have replaced league SBC's. 3 moments per team, per league with a 86-88 rated league player costing 60 stars
[2022-12-22 19:26:16] <+jayden_joshua21> Do you think now is a smart time to sell informs? I picked up a couple for 11k when they were still available in packs, they‚Äôre like 19/20k now
[2022-12-22 19:26:16] <%+elpeano> Just got that special Pope card in the draft
[2022-12-22 19:26:20] <+xochubbzox> is the 11x 81 worth it M
[2022-12-22 19:26:22] <+xochubbzox> ?
[2022-12-22 19:26:29] <%Creativename_> EA under-delivering again? Surely not
[2022-12-22 19:26:30] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> Im thinking 8pm for second channel vid. Can delay if you want
[2022-12-22 19:26:30] <@%Viperlization> yeah jack makes a good point
[2022-12-22 19:26:30] <the_real_mark_henry> They could at least put some gold's in with that moments pack
[2022-12-22 19:26:32] <+grimmers88> I think that about swaps token objectives too, repeatable with same token every time, if I want to grind every reward, let me
[2022-12-22 19:26:33] <TreWinz22> deleted fifa so disappointed in the game
[2022-12-22 19:26:35] <@%Viperlization> moments is league sbc replacement
[2022-12-22 19:26:37] <kingkurdo00> i never played moments i think now its time
[2022-12-22 19:26:39] <bigjayarch> I did all the World Cup 1s yesterday it was crap
[2022-12-22 19:26:41] <afifnaufal> ea wasting their potential man
[2022-12-22 19:26:43] <Makezuu1> Last year these 85+ star player packs were SBC. Now just packs so people would spend fifa points. Wont buy any and support this bs.
[2022-12-22 19:26:50] <%Dezalleycat> Do you rekkon for EAFC next year we are heading for fully untradable nep?
[2022-12-22 19:26:52] <%+elpeano> Just got that sbc Pope card in the draft
[2022-12-22 19:26:52] <islander771231> nep there will be more fifa world cup tokens or theyre done?
[2022-12-22 19:26:54] <%+Kieran96cfc> such a good idea but a terribly implemented thing again, just like the team event thing
[2022-12-22 19:26:57] <%+ace2ey> I got Dumfries in mine, luckily dupe tradeable
[2022-12-22 19:27:04] <+kingnothing_x7> the 3 84+ pp's are good
[2022-12-22 19:27:10] <tovers98_1> Nep do you still think League SBCs won‚Äôt come?
[2022-12-22 19:27:14] <messi303issem> nep how many tokens are out?
[2022-12-22 19:27:16] <+JakeHann7> they don't like grinders its become apparent, imagine repeatable stars and unlimited draft tokens.. but they'd never allow for anything like that
[2022-12-22 19:27:17] <$princ3mihai> just got here, no 6PM ?
[2022-12-22 19:27:23] <%+wardy11xx> league sbcs at 7pm LUL LUL LUL
[2022-12-22 19:27:23] <TreWinz22> is efootball any good?
[2022-12-22 19:27:25] <+CroaCrado> check bateson tweet? sbc cards in draft

[2022-12-22 19:27:32] <%johnfive21> Why Thursday?
[2022-12-22 19:27:32] <+tylercon1> SBC cards are now in draft
[2022-12-22 19:27:37] <+caldeira19> @NepentheZ Benfica turned down an 100M offer for Enzo! the release clause is 120M, i think he will leave this market sadly
[2022-12-22 19:27:37] <+tenma_1019> feels like they deliberately fucc this game up in order to hype their next game
[2022-12-22 19:27:37] <+tylercon1> Showdowns are now in draft
[2022-12-22 19:27:39] <%Creativename_> EA are a company that work like they are a part time, small little startup business ran by waster college students on the side
[2022-12-22 19:27:39] <+memphisdepie88> knowing ea will be a store add on
[2022-12-22 19:27:43] <+CroaCrado> shaw too
[2022-12-22 19:27:45] <kj_stakz> the teams event is the most useless thing ever
[2022-12-22 19:27:47] <+tylercon1> Fofana is in
[2022-12-22 19:27:48] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> I mean it doesnt have to be thursday right
[2022-12-22 19:27:49] <johnthegg> maybe EA doesn't want to release them before toty
[2022-12-22 19:27:51] <+simonaus21> Why does that mean they wont come?
[2022-12-22 19:27:54] <%+mojawad> I genuinely got hyped cause generally FutDonk is reliable
[2022-12-22 19:27:54] <%+colinthfc93> shaw is there too
[2022-12-22 19:27:54] <+tylercon1> Fofana and Shaw are

[2022-12-22 19:28:00] <+plantedwharf545> Aguerd is in draft too
[2022-12-22 19:28:01] <%+Jack_Lacey2005> i think league sbcs will come after world cup items are gone
[2022-12-22 19:28:01] <Bonus_Exitus> Didnt one of the leakers reply to you when the SBC card got leaked and said something about January?
[2022-12-22 19:28:02] <NiceToMichu09> I saw a Correa

[2022-12-22 19:28:11] <lozzer360> At what point would u quit this shit game

[2022-12-22 19:28:15] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> Theyve released them on four separate days over the last 5 years
[2022-12-22 19:28:16] <+drisshoogers> do u think any promo pack is worth opening?
[2022-12-22 19:28:18] <%+clanwalk3r> All completed moments should reset with the season. I want to engage and grind them but I have NOTHING to play in the mode!!
[2022-12-22 19:28:22] <+tylercon1> Just seen Aguerd now as well
[2022-12-22 19:28:28] <kingkurdo00> i think its better that there is no content today so that we save our fodder for tomorow

[2022-12-22 19:28:56] <%Frog1786> EA have been all about FP so really can't see them bringing league sbcs out when TOTY just round the corner
[2022-12-22 19:28:56] <here4rewards_> @SpreadsheetFifa Why was everyone obsessed with it coming on a Thursday if EA change it around so much?
[2022-12-22 19:28:59] <+JakeHann7> criminally underrated card

[2022-12-22 20:41:41] <69tw> they literally have the score predicitons
[2022-12-22 20:41:41] <%+TheJamieP123> NBA was a test run for new rewards i assume
[2022-12-22 20:42:08] <%m3elv1n> the giving league gives 2x on assist and rebounds
[2022-12-22 20:42:28] <69tw> second column
[2022-12-22 20:42:35] VIEWERS: 1¬†008
[2022-12-22 20:43:06] <69tw> since theres no cap you just wanna put players that score high and get a lot of Assists and Rebounds
[2022-12-22 20:43:07] <%$lfcplz> dunno what to take for WW swaps, stuck between the 85 x 10 and 83 x 25 or three 83x25 and  three 84+ PPs
[2022-12-22 20:43:20] <%+Brandez84> Yeah pretty much your best lineup but assists n rebounds I think are double
[2022-12-22 20:43:22] <%m3elv1n> its 2x on assist and rebounds
[2022-12-22 20:43:28] <+drewcox999> if steph is still out, klay is a good shout
[2022-12-22 20:43:33] <savvyon> porzingis is questionable to play tomorrow thoughh
[2022-12-22 20:43:33] <69tw> its 2x score on assists and rebounds
[2022-12-22 20:43:56] <niiick____> Gn nep i love u
[2022-12-22 20:44:08] <savvyon> rozier is doubtful for friday as well
[2022-12-22 20:44:10] <+RDEP1423> just a tip for when it comes to the free swap if you check rewards and the tiers for each those will be your options depending on the player you trade in. so say you trade in a LeBron in tier 1 your 5 choices should be 5 players from those in tier 1 rewards that week if that makes sense
[2022-12-22 20:44:22] <+whufcconnor> you sold Allen on the RTG nep?
[2022-12-22 20:44:30] <+3dgyracoon> Nep jalen green is the equivalent of saka btw
