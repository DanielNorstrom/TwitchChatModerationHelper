[2022-12-09 00:13:58] <Grognosh2> When PocketTrain was but a wee lad there was a Thomas the Tank Engine model in his room. One day he decided to take it outside and play with it. After playing with it for hours on end he put the train in his pocket when some girls came around and teased him for his pocket train. As time passed people forgot his real name until one day he himself forgot it and became PocketTrain.

[2022-12-09 00:41:31] <Nefarius4> It gives more time for skill expression and lowers the reliance on draw.

[2022-12-09 00:42:38] <Nefarius4> Absolutely. I don't see how you could argue there is less skill expression in games that last a few turns longer on average.

[2022-12-09 01:53:08] <%ChrisIsError_> don't float any mana rogue

[2022-12-09 02:16:35] <leskobr4ndon> hey guys, I was wondering about the new dh weapon that removes the minions from the deck and shuffle the discovers. It feels super weak, because that way it's not possible to get the minions discounted by dimensions. I get that it makes it so you draw the minions more consistently while activating other cards that require no minions in the deck. But is that really good enough? Am I missing something?
[2022-12-09 02:16:43] <HectorDoesGoRug> @leskobr4ndon not reading all that

[2022-12-09 02:18:58] <vv_hs> @leskobr4ndon It is superstrong, maybe you should try a different build of this deck. This deck has so much draw and don't need to discover a minions early.

[2022-12-09 02:19:12] <leskobr4ndon> @leskobr4ndon interesting have not thought about  this card. I've been seeing many dhs using it for the usual jace, naga and xymox package, it feels really underwhelming
[2022-12-09 02:19:29] <HectorDoesGoRug> its never bonelord KEKL

[2022-12-09 02:19:51] <HectorDoesGoRug> bonelord ends the wrong player KEKL
[2022-12-09 02:20:02] <Zoulis> @leskobr4ndon there's relic-less spell dh. But tbh I think the best list has brand and relics. You don't really care about discounts, it's a much more balanced deck than it was pre-expansion
[2022-12-09 02:20:05] <Vaevoe> @leskobr4ndon I use jace, xymox, and the spell damage +2 3 mana minion. its just so versatile and feels quite good into aggro and control

[2022-12-09 13:19:21] <%+Devilsmouth> yep great win rate vs druid
[2022-12-09 13:19:27] <+nocnocnocnocnocnocnoc> what list?

[2022-12-09 13:19:41] <%+Eranidor> no way paladin beats druid LUL
[2022-12-09 13:19:43] <damondse> meati why are you running saurfang
[2022-12-09 13:19:46] <Fogoo1> I am watching these games and my question is: is frostmourne really that good here?
[2022-12-09 13:20:21] <@^StreamElements> Play Yumon with Meatman's exclusive cards to support my channel! https://app.yumon.world/creators/meatiHS/booster
[2022-12-09 13:20:35] <frozen887> they are so expensive and slow
[2022-12-09 13:20:42] <%+Devilsmouth> paladin does beat druid. By the time druid does anything you play jailer and  fill the board with big threats they cannot answer, Paladin is all i play but i'm not arguing with @Eranidor who know sbest
[2022-12-09 13:20:49] <%+Eranidor> i think if you running more legendarys and cut weapons it would be better
[2022-12-09 13:21:06] <kazikazinova> do u think this is the best dk deck right now?
[2022-12-09 13:21:07] <%+Eranidor> or something like Watch post LUL

[2022-12-09 13:21:28] <frozen887> @Devilsmouth that depends on the druid hand KEKW not yours
[2022-12-09 13:21:30] <hediNhos> i cannot for the love of god beat druid at blood dk
[2022-12-09 13:21:32] <!%404Jude> Anyone plaued the 30 frost aggro dk?
[2022-12-09 13:21:34] <frozen887> u could die turn 6 vs them
[2022-12-09 13:21:55] <Fatamerikans> 40 is better than 30 by about 33%
[2022-12-09 13:22:00] <UADokKi> @MeatiHS What do you think about Jailer in this deck?
[2022-12-09 13:22:26] <kazikazinova> sorry was disconnected what u say about the deck ?
[2022-12-09 13:22:27] <%ChrisIsError_> patron Kappa
[2022-12-09 13:22:30] <bigpump2000> @hediNhos Highest standard dk against druid is 35% wr. Very likely youre not going to win
[2022-12-09 13:22:32] <baeqvist> 1/3 corpse gen maybe
[2022-12-09 13:22:37] <kazikazinova> u think it has potential?
[2022-12-09 13:22:39] <snensch> @Fatamerikans Ye but 30 is only 25% worse
[2022-12-09 13:22:45] <%+Eranidor> @devilsmouth yes I know it better i beat every paladin every time with my druid LUL
[2022-12-09 13:22:46] <Sevel07> mutanus ixdWaddle
[2022-12-09 13:22:48] <LeoBM> Is almost impossible to win against Armor druid with this deck :(

[2022-12-09 13:23:11] <LeoBM> and blizzard still didn't fixed the astalor brann bug
[2022-12-09 13:23:14] <@%+DanTheGreat94> when friends say lets party dont prty you will come home at ridicilous times -.-
[2022-12-09 13:23:15] <bigpump2000> Is patron just for skipping your opponents turn?
[2022-12-09 13:23:19] <q7pie> I think Ashbringer is fine because it can function as removal with little downside.

[2022-12-09 13:23:25] <%up_the_down> i kinda like mutanus aswell
[2022-12-09 13:23:30] <q7pie> But Frostmourne takes too long to pay off imo.

[2022-12-09 13:37:52] <%Zounderkite_> @MadamMimsMan nah It's a bug it counts manathirst as battlecry too It's supposed to deal 24 with brann
[2022-12-09 13:37:52] <%+rakuzanseirin> zola is good for copying patchwerk
[2022-12-09 13:37:55] <+LotionFeelsGood> how is it a bug
[2022-12-09 13:37:59] <Fatamerikans> anub'rekhan is a bug

[2022-12-09 13:38:00] <PaladinIRL> Plague spreaders are Poggers
[2022-12-09 13:38:01] <Chanji_The_Beast> and blood spells you dont use
[2022-12-09 13:38:02] <Gerend> it should be 24 damage not 32
[2022-12-09 13:38:03] <+LotionFeelsGood> it says in the card
[2022-12-09 13:38:06] <%ChrisIsError_> there it is #MetaBreaker

[2022-12-09 13:38:21] <+MadamMimsMan> @LeoBM i dont see how. The manathirst part triggers on both battlecries like it should
[2022-12-09 13:38:21] <+LotionFeelsGood> @Gerend so 48 damage and not 64?
[2022-12-09 13:38:25] <!Frommytv> the 5 mana divineshield draw guy for consistency

[2022-12-09 13:38:55] <LeoBM> @MadamMimsMan Bro, if this was true, you would get armor twitch and deal 2 dmg twice, which doesn't happen.
[2022-12-09 13:38:57] <havertzon> Why patron ?
[2022-12-09 13:39:03] <+LotionFeelsGood> @Gerend so 48 dmg on turn is good

[2022-12-09 13:42:26] <+MadamMimsMan> @LeoBM also... looking through some of the other manathirst minions they dont all have battlecries, so manathirst is not tied to the battlecry like i thought. Thx for explaining

[2022-12-09 16:48:31] <Fogoo1> honestly I don't understand why do you refuse to play that health-cost guy
[2022-12-09 16:48:36] <cizuss> @smilingsaint yeah, thats how it works, minions give corpses when they die
[2022-12-09 16:48:38] <blaze35hs> saurfang seems like a terrible card
[2022-12-09 16:48:47] <+ClyonBlizz> @smilingsaint you really are obsessed with saurfang

[2022-12-09 16:49:02] <smilingsaint> @cizuss not saying the corpses outweigh the arguments against, but he is very low on corpses
[2022-12-09 16:49:18] <+markshev> saurfang against rogue = deal 5 damage to your own face chat
[2022-12-09 16:49:24] <nife_hs> ah yes 5 health gain a corpse what a great card
[2022-12-09 16:49:24] <owl9t> Am i greedy put 2 Amalgam of the Deep to discover another rune minions in DK ?
[2022-12-09 16:49:27] <Hachiibee> he's saving saurfang for next game guys, chill
[2022-12-09 16:49:35] <GerardTCG> have you tried a 1x devourer in blood DK? it adds a huge threat + swing and lets you preserve soulstealer for the wide boards
