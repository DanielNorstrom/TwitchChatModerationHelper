[2022-12-12 05:30:58] <%ssdeluxe> Tumblr will be one of those websites, like Furaffinity, that I stay away from. Not because i dislike the people on them but i fear what they would do to my mental health. Just looking at Grimmi shows what long term Tumblr-itis can do.

[2022-12-12 06:20:48] <%$Tempest_52> I have seen a video on the later seasons and this is nothing compared to where it goes
[2022-12-12 06:20:52] <%ssdeluxe> easy way to overcome pedophilia 1 see child 2 be aroused 3 seek immediate psychological help.
[2022-12-12 06:20:53] <%if_you_seiso> it's just like Hilda and Zelda from Sabrina

[2022-12-12 06:21:24] <%+smococoa> grimmi14Grandmacandy Omg this is my favorite candy
[2022-12-12 06:21:25] <+christheghosthost> also, fun fact involving Riverdale and the Netflix marketing program. depending on what you view you may get a different key card. one being more dark and edgy for dramas. and peppier slash funny if you watch more comedies. this method also has done a racism cause guess what? robots can be a racist.
[2022-12-12 06:21:25] <%RomeoEchoDelta> @combustedlemon Good fucking question, I'm not even sure the writers know.
[2022-12-12 06:21:26] <@%Extrafuzzy> I cant be the victim of a abuser if I AM THE ABUSER grimmi14Grimmilin
[2022-12-12 06:21:41] <$UltraFist0> Wat
[2022-12-12 06:21:42] <%ArthurAbbott> @247psi Like the show is like "uwu she just loves him its so pure and kind and the meen parents make her leave town so sad"

[2022-12-12 06:21:46] <userredacted404> I think that disqualifies her as being nice
[2022-12-12 06:21:48] <247psi> but those later seasons though? legit insanity that absolutely no one could have ever predicted
[2022-12-12 06:22:04] <%CombustedLemon> Race Bot war
[2022-12-12 06:22:05] <%code_phoenix410> omg what the heck is the writers smoking
[2022-12-12 06:22:11] <@%Extrafuzzy> There's an arc where the town is the warzone of a 3 way cult
[2022-12-12 06:22:15] <%$eleni_afk> Racist robots?.. notkohSip
[2022-12-12 06:22:23] <%KyokoAsura> it's because people are super racist on the internet
[2022-12-12 06:22:25] <%CombustedLemon> Based Robots
[2022-12-12 06:22:25] <@%^Nightbot> based on what? grimmi14SmugGrimm
[2022-12-12 06:22:29] <!+Jignx> arent there multiple supernatural serial killers in riverdale

[2022-12-12 06:22:42] <247psi> well, the ai is based off of the people it's learning from, soooooooo
[2022-12-12 06:22:43] VIEWERS: 322
[2022-12-12 06:22:45] <%ArthurAbbott> Its happened with so many chatbots its insane
[2022-12-12 06:22:46] <!%$Prof_PavloVT> It's mostly because internet algorithms are tuned to get engagement, anger gets engagement, and bigotry drives anger.  So robots get trained on bigotry.
[2022-12-12 06:22:48] <%ssdeluxe> Get on internet, get racist, hate women! grimmi14ArmLeft cottonwLetsGo grimmi14ArmRight
[2022-12-12 06:22:49] <Fridge_Draws> I thought they just recycle the things people spam into them

[2022-12-12 06:22:55] <$UltraFist0> probably check at the engineers who keep making the racist programming
[2022-12-12 06:23:01] <%k_yama_> they get like that because they learn from us
[2022-12-12 06:23:04] <%AbsoluteMenhera> AI can't help but be terminally online
[2022-12-12 06:23:08] <%+KaptiRevo> It's cause they soak up the internet and there is sooooo much of that out there
[2022-12-12 06:23:12] <%delighteddotard> crazy ideologies are always most prominent in propaganda
[2022-12-12 06:23:13] <%lord_badong> People think it's funny to teach the chatbots gamer words
[2022-12-12 06:23:16] <%$Tempest_52> It made the news recently that a bot DIDN'T racist
[2022-12-12 06:23:17] <Pond_water> Use racist dataset (or let trolls screw with it) and you get what you get.
[2022-12-12 06:23:35] <!%$Prof_PavloVT> Fun Fact:  Twitter couldn't implement an algorithm to suppress white supremacy because too many Republican politicians got caught in it....
[2022-12-12 06:23:44] <%otecoy> i dunno. i talked to an elon musk ai and he just seemed like he was a king. then i told him that if people are born into countries, then they have no natural right to their own liberty. and the elon musk king ai was like "huh. never considered that."
[2022-12-12 06:23:47] <247psi> there was an ai that was learning off of a small niche crowd on tiktok and she was really sweet and a minecraft gamer
[2022-12-12 06:23:54] <Magpi12> i love your super soothing voice
[2022-12-12 06:24:01] <%RomeoEchoDelta> @christheghosthost So what like if you watch a Medea movie it portrays the show as a comedy where all the characters are played by a single black actor?
[2022-12-12 06:24:11] <%ArthurAbbott> Not YET
[2022-12-12 06:24:17] <paperm00nzzz> yay
[2022-12-12 06:24:19] <%ArthurAbbott> Give them another season
[2022-12-12 06:24:21] <%+KaptiRevo> Grimmi, have you ever played Hello Neighbor? Would you do that on stream?
[2022-12-12 06:24:26] <+christheghosthost> then it happened to Netflix and I laughed my ass off cause they made key cards not include the African American cast for some people cause the ai assumed
[2022-12-12 06:24:28] <%ssdeluxe> I'd love this as default Grimmi voice.
[2022-12-12 06:24:28] <%code_phoenix410> just pedophiles and zombies lol

[2022-12-12 07:07:31] <%KumotsuneSV> Somehow Grimmi has a tendency to pick very difficult games to play on stream
