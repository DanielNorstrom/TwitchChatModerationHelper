[2023-01-01 02:45:01] <@^Nightbot> Introducing Akiko the shapeshifting magical Tanuki! (she will be my custom model sometime in the future. Drawing by me) https://tinyurl.com/y8duvjh6
[2023-01-01 02:45:06] <@%NautAJerman> sure @bakeup
[2023-01-01 02:45:09] <Naliina> It's the leash that makes me think its a puppo.
[2023-01-01 02:45:12] <Naliina> Not a wolf or a tanuki.
[2023-01-01 02:45:40] <$yoanndelord> at least the collar will be meaningfull if you are a dog :D

[2023-01-01 02:46:37] <Naliina> For the 3D I know a rather talented modeler that's also a V-tuber.
[2023-01-01 02:46:44] <Naliina> They know the ins and outs really well.
[2023-01-01 02:47:24] <Naliina> They prefer making models accurate and efficient, over painfully perfect but also... can't run on a NASA super-computer.
[2023-01-01 02:47:42] <$yoanndelord> it must be because im bit drunk but my eyes are hypnotized by some round things hahahaha :D
[2023-01-01 02:47:55] <Naliina> Like what the ref image you give is most likely what comes out sorta deal.
[2023-01-01 02:48:12] <$yoanndelord> The but of the dog at the left lol

[2023-01-01 20:23:44] <Elohunt> The worth of money is actually just the amount of money in relation to the population. Everything else is decided by the prices of the seller and the wages. Imagine the minimum wage would raise equally with the inflation every year.

[2023-01-01 22:18:59] <%Zhylf> Its hard to describe the taste. took this fomr a site that makes it.
[2023-01-01 22:19:01] <%Zhylf> Sweet and salty with a real pinch of character and own style. It is not easy to put into words the taste of mess butter, but "good" is one of the most common. It is also completely natural, made from whey which is a good source of calcium and protein and with added iron for extra energy.
