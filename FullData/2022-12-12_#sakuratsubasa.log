[2022-12-12 21:39:38] <+mboytwo> Google says "Culatello is one of Italy’s best known and most prized salumi. It comes from the province of Parma and is made by curing only the rear muscle of the haunch of pigs born, raised and butchered in Lombardy and Emilia Romagna, which explains its fairly high cost. It is shaped like a large egg and weighs about 6 1/2 pounds. It has been eligible for DOP (Protected Designation of Origin) recognition since 1996."

[2022-12-12 23:42:33] <%ChibiFlonne> what if you had a random assortment of nintendo music playing in the background?

[2022-12-12 23:43:16] <codemann813> no, like its literally not anything nintendo can do
[2022-12-12 23:43:25] <%+sleepyaussor> Nintendo hit hard on projects that were interfering with their secret projects. Like AM2R getting hit hard about a year before the Metroid 2 remake came out
[2022-12-12 23:43:28] <@%Smashface_Games> To be fair, that information was part of the big Nintenleak from 2 years ago right?
[2022-12-12 23:43:30] <@%ReynZephyr> oh good. I thought I got isekaid
[2022-12-12 23:43:32] <@%+TheFogz> I could get used to waking up to SakuStream :P

[2022-12-12 23:43:43] <!%sparkboi21> An early Saku stream!? And I missed the run!? Noooooo
[2022-12-12 23:43:44] <@%EsponMyst> What if it was forever?  What if Saku was forever stuck 12 hours in the past?
[2022-12-12 23:43:47] <+mboytwo> too late this is my first Saku stream and im used to Saku normal people hours!
[2022-12-12 23:43:50] <codemann813> its some random schmuck who uses copyrighted music and sampling it in their crappy rap album

[2022-12-12 23:44:03] <@%+TheFogz> @sleepyaussor Yeah I was gonna say this is a really good sign that there is a zelda tactics game coming out

[2022-12-12 23:44:36] <@%+Skarthe> I would play a Zelda Tactics game.
[2022-12-12 23:44:45] <%ChibiFlonne> saku unga bunga
[2022-12-12 23:44:47] <@%+TheFogz> Fire Emblem: Zelda
[2022-12-12 23:44:49] <@%+Skarthe> It's a bit outside my normal genre, y'know, but I 'd play it.
[2022-12-12 23:44:49] <%+Hyperstryke> ...That's a viable strategy, you know.
[2022-12-12 23:45:00] <%+murixbob> Saku is a daywalker vampire confirmed
[2022-12-12 23:45:03] <%+Hinopio> But Saku, sunlight is great!
[2022-12-12 23:45:10] <+smbarbour> Yeah, YouTube's copyright dispute system is complete garbage...  The claimant gets to exclusively decide if your dispute is valid.
[2022-12-12 23:45:10] <+mboytwo> Sets alarm for normal people hours Saku streams
[2022-12-12 23:45:11] <@%+Skarthe> (I am maybe being a little sarcastic.  :P )
[2022-12-12 23:45:14] <shopvacboy> some people never thought a Zelda warriors would happen, but look what came out
[2022-12-12 23:45:27] <%+murixbob> @Hinopio Sunlight has UV that causes skin cancer
[2022-12-12 23:45:33] <@%+TheFogz> WHO SAID SUNLIGHT IS GREAT!?
[2022-12-12 23:45:35] <@%+Skarthe> Oh man, Saku, let me tell you, speaking of sarcasm and bad jokes
[2022-12-12 23:45:38] <%+Hyperstryke> True, and HW is practically perfect.

[2022-12-12 23:45:41] <%+Hinopio> Sunlight has vitamin D which is good for you.
[2022-12-12 23:45:42] <@%Smashface_Games> theyre starting to bring out spinoff games that im not a huge fan of. 1st it was Musou, now it could *maybe* be tactics
[2022-12-12 23:45:52] <@%+Skarthe> So I had a guy out here to measure my windows and give me an estimate on replacing them
[2022-12-12 23:46:01] <%+Hinopio> I'm normally a night person but being able to do stuff and go places is great.
[2022-12-12 23:46:06] <@%+Skarthe> Turned out the company does a whole like, three hour presentation on prices and different types of windows
[2022-12-12 23:46:09] <%+HtomSirveaux85> I find it silly how the claimant doesn't have to PROVE they own the rights
[2022-12-12 23:46:24] VIEWERS: 127
[2022-12-12 23:46:25] <@%+Skarthe> But it was ok because that also meant I had a captive audience who couldn't complain at my constant window puns
[2022-12-12 23:46:49] <+mboytwo> They need to have the claimant prove they own the material
[2022-12-12 23:46:53] <%+sleepyaussor> what if someone were to copyright claim the person?
