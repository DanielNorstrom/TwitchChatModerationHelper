[2023-01-06 19:58:17] <!%schelite> ive got a 30kg draw weight bow in my shed. cant hunt with it but it works.

[2023-01-06 19:58:52] <%+Ahriii01> Your body does shake if you're not used to firing a bow, that is correct

[2023-01-06 19:59:32] <!%schelite> @Ahriii01 thats why you should be starting with a weaker bow to get the form right and develop the necessary muscles and slowly moving up the strengths.
[2023-01-06 19:59:39] <%+Ahriii01> @Ahriii01 exactly

[2023-01-06 20:00:05] <NewfieNewbie> @schelite Question on draw weight. Does the meaning of that imply that drawing the bow takes the same energy as lifting a weight of the same mass?

[2023-01-06 20:00:51] <%+Ahriii01> @schelite It's the amount of force needed to fully draw the bow

[2023-01-06 20:01:33] <NewfieNewbie> @schelite Right, but weight is not a force measurement. It's a mass measurement.
