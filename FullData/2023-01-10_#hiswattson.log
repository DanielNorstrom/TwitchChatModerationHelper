[2023-01-10 03:08:05] <+jjmax11111> yes
[2023-01-10 03:08:06] <AndrewDragonCh> W
[2023-01-10 03:08:08] <DerangedTennisBall> it's like Denuvo DRM but for tractors
[2023-01-10 03:08:09] <+phillycheese259> John Deere did that
[2023-01-10 03:08:11] <!%$nihimm> farmer meas merica
[2023-01-10 03:08:12] <@%+BernieTheThird> thats a w for farmers

[2023-01-10 03:08:14] <%+TheAttackDonkey> that was correct but extremely vague
[2023-01-10 03:08:17] <%Hitosherizu> Apple was the same way with their devices, which is I believe the precedent they used in John Deere's case
[2023-01-10 03:08:17] <@%Nephthys_52> and if they do. the equipment gets locked out and they cant start it @HisWattson
[2023-01-10 03:08:19] <+KingSlabith> Same with mcdonalds ice cream machines

[2023-01-10 03:37:58] <MyLow21> High key recommend getting twerked on
[2023-01-10 03:38:06] <c18shadow1> will the g7 still be optimal over the 30/30 after its nerf yall think?

[2023-01-10 03:38:20] <%HellaSama> "Will Twerk for RP"
[2023-01-10 03:38:27] <%QueenAlyx_> wattson is a good Christian conservative Floridian now and would never have anyone twerk on him before marriahe

[2023-01-10 03:38:39] <%Proud_Mimic> ok real talk how much of a difference is the 2 damage on the g7 reallllly gonna make?
[2023-01-10 03:38:42] <%+GeorgieLive> if you go to Puerto rico and go to a pub you will get to know the "DOBLE PASO" it's basically a better version of getting twerked on (x

[2023-01-10 22:53:28] <+getnthere> people care more about horizon being nerf then they did when path and octane got the same nerf pretty much
[2023-01-10 22:53:29] <HotTotties> it won't let me queue, keeps timing out then giving me abandon penalty even though i never get in game :(

[2023-01-10 22:53:39] <@%^Nightbot> No one important.
[2023-01-10 22:53:47] <%Hitosherizu> Pretty sure they use a custom client/patch as they also have to remove heat shields, sky dive emotes (new), and a few other things @strificus8
[2023-01-10 22:53:51] <SourPinapples> @Pocoloco989 not how that works
[2023-01-10 22:53:55] <okey77> the nerf is probably a bug since they didnt mention it in the patch note

[2023-01-10 23:11:39] <麗奈さん (reina_osu)> idk psure they nerfed her speed when she goes up on her Q, and the strafe-speed a few seasons back, should revert that if they're increasing the recoil

[2023-01-10 23:17:44] <steezylmao> dayum :(((
[2023-01-10 23:17:47] <goukibuki> Best Seer nerf would be his passive and tactical share the same cooldown! It makes his tactical so much more critical and missing with it way more detrimental

[2023-01-10 23:18:30] <KoAsT00> Wattson ( the legend ) is OP .. fight me if you disagree
[2023-01-10 23:18:48] <%Hitosherizu> You think Wattos is good enough to use scouts in the Q Messiah? Let's be honest here
[2023-01-10 23:18:57] <cad_dude> @goukibuki He just needs to not see people that are not moving or crouch walking
[2023-01-10 23:19:02] <+EddieMountain> slow start
[2023-01-10 23:19:08] <!%NV_MessiaH> he only uses scout playing horizon anyways
[2023-01-10 23:19:08] <%+tacticbuzz> Yeah... I think they buffed Fuse's alt and didn't tell anyone.

Are they ok with watching this game die?   Please help me understand.    It doesn’t even make sense on the capitalism side of things.

[2023-01-10 23:21:14] <goukibuki> @cad_dude you mean with his passive? I guess that would help ratting in ranked. His passive is crazy strong still. You are right it probably shouldnt see crouchers.

[2023-01-10 23:36:19] <+BigolBaconNA> i feel like it was part of her ability that her aim wasn't random on the lift bc it's not like jumping or jump padding, youre just going up slowly
[2023-01-10 23:36:22] <goukibuki> it's probably not wrong...i doubt they really extend server space for a 4 year old game. I think the userbase is where its gonna be
