[2023-01-04 01:47:50] <%JakenVeina> actually, I have a coincidental question, for anyone who knows: If I set Heat 1 on the sword, to be able to get the first 3 bounties again, and then end up with that being my first clear for the sword, do I get 2 Titan Blood from Hades?

[2023-01-04 01:49:22] <%JakenVeina> so, like, I could clear it on Heat 1, and then have to go BACK to Heat 0 to get the final reward? Hmmm.... fuck it, let's see what happens

[2023-01-04 01:50:49] <LoonyNo7> @JakenVeina if I remember correctly exceeding the heat simply unlocks as if you were on the basic heat level (i.e. 5 heat when at 1 rewards unlocks you the the rewards for 1)

[2023-01-04 02:10:56] <!%Ebonslayer> @Illuna_Meira I was wondering about that. The block rush is his special isn't it? So if he got the Athena special could he block and deflect projectiles at the caster?
[2023-01-04 02:11:04] <zxthed> charon's well
[2023-01-04 02:11:23] <Camopon> bull rush is charged normal

[2023-01-04 02:18:52] <LoonyNo7> I wonder if the cast happens where you are or where it shoots, the latter would be brilliant

[2023-01-04 03:59:54] <%OptPlaysGames> poseidon and zeus
[2023-01-04 04:00:00] <StillTrynaGetAHandbeezy> zeus with this special in insane
[2023-01-04 04:00:00] VIEWERS: 538
[2023-01-04 04:00:01] <Hachiyon> zeus could be good
[2023-01-04 04:00:01] <%SlamDunkinson> pretty sure that mark counts towards privileged status
[2023-01-04 04:00:07] <StillTrynaGetAHandbeezy> especially with the special buff hammer
[2023-01-04 04:00:08] <LoonyNo7> crit and big damage on the attack
[2023-01-04 04:00:08] <falcon3939> Level up Pom
[2023-01-04 04:00:08] <+magnafides> @avianartworks the hidden aspects have specific triggers
[2023-01-04 04:00:14] <Hachiyon> poseidon for attack zeus for special?
[2023-01-04 04:00:14] <LoonyNo7> this bow can literally work with anything
[2023-01-04 04:00:18] <%$Illuna_Meira> do you have mirror buff for doing more damage when enemies have at least 2 debuff?
[2023-01-04 04:00:19] <rightsidedown> i like zeus special with artemis attack
[2023-01-04 04:00:20] <+MegaCookieOfDoom> No crit you already did that :)
[2023-01-04 04:00:20] <zxthed> for Rama? Artemis or Aphrodite
[2023-01-04 04:00:24] <littlepigb0i> Ares and Artemis has heat seeking chainsaw blades, right?
[2023-01-04 04:00:24] <+evilweirdo0> I'm hyped for Hades 2
[2023-01-04 04:00:27] <zehdre> Zeus on special only hits lightning once though, so kinda bad
[2023-01-04 04:00:28] <Larinett> time to lvl up keepsakes
[2023-01-04 04:00:31] <Aruvella> Run back Artemis?
[2023-01-04 04:00:32] <+headofthewood> artemis crit?
[2023-01-04 04:00:37] <%+ms_p_dorkle> I just did Artemis on attack and Demeter on special on this aspect today
[2023-01-04 04:00:38] <+MegaCookieOfDoom> Posiden for the wave lol
[2023-01-04 04:00:47] <Aruvella> Poseidon would be amazing.
[2023-01-04 04:00:53] <MatrimCauthon__> I like butterfly and then just see what comes up
[2023-01-04 04:00:59] <zehdre> Artemis on Sharanga is just for b i m g n u m b e r
[2023-01-04 04:00:59] <AvianArtworks> magnafides thanks, I remember getting burned out at how damage spongey some of the bosses were so I didn't get this far
[2023-01-04 04:01:03] <%SteveSketches> If you think about it, Rupture is kinda like super poison
[2023-01-04 04:01:12] <%$Illuna_Meira> I would go dionysius and demeter
[2023-01-04 04:01:16] <Hachiyon> poseidon for attack zeus for special could be good i think
[2023-01-04 04:01:46] <zehdre> @AvianArtworks They were damage sponges because you didn't get this far. The upgrades you unlock permanently increase your power a lot

[2023-01-04 04:02:20] <MrPeer> @AvianArtworks you are missing out, early on you need good rng to do good damage but the game makes sure with the mirror and aspects you will do good damage
[2023-01-04 04:02:23] <AvianArtworks> Makes sense, just got really tedious to deal with
[2023-01-04 04:02:27] <%+ms_p_dorkle> anything's gonna be fun

[2023-01-04 04:03:05] <+magnafides> @zehdre yup, seems like almost everyone hits an inflection point where clearing almost every run is expected, until the heat gets high enough
[2023-01-04 04:03:11] <%jigglejuicegamez> do it
[2023-01-04 04:03:13] <StillTrynaGetAHandbeezy> poseidon special with the slam buff with this bow in hilarious
[2023-01-04 04:03:14] <+MegaCookieOfDoom> Give enemies max health tbh

[2023-01-04 04:04:41] <StillTrynaGetAHandbeezy> explosive shot reminds me of dead cells runs with the explosive bow, you fucking 1shot everything
[2023-01-04 04:04:48] <StillTrynaGetAHandbeezy> but yeah, it's slow and you're vulnerable

[2023-01-04 06:08:44] <eternalpiemaker> @Unholy_Revenant Great long story and well designed end game. 200-300 hours isn't surprising at all.
[2023-01-04 06:08:53] <!%$Mohl97> I love that you beat the game without even finding the entire mechanic
[2023-01-04 06:09:01] <%WakeX> max uses per run
[2023-01-04 06:09:03] <YamiXx> you cant summon skelly against skelly
[2023-01-04 06:09:05] <%+GIHunter6> Until you rank it up, yes
[2023-01-04 06:09:11] <%WakeX> you cant summon it twice per encounter
[2023-01-04 06:09:11] <%mistahmistah> yes, until you rank it up
[2023-01-04 06:09:18] <Aruvella> Until you rank it up
[2023-01-04 06:09:20] <%dustbuni> if you give him more it'll rank up
[2023-01-04 06:09:22] <sineporf> it's good
[2023-01-04 06:09:24] <%OptPlaysGames> the 1 per escape is green because you can rank it up
[2023-01-04 06:09:43] <%+ZeGreatPumpkinani> it's in addition, you get one summon
[2023-01-04 06:09:44] <+derek3891> it's like the dd you can buy it back at carons well
[2023-01-04 06:09:53] <+thedarthgecko> need Poseidons call for rip current

[2023-01-04 06:10:04] <!%Ebonslayer> Should go plume the whole run and try to double down on the Hermes damage buff.

[2023-01-04 06:15:22] <blackendflesh> I feel like Hermes boons never show what you need
[2023-01-04 06:15:39] <Akiha_Khai> @Oroboro You were looking for more titan blood earlier, clearing at each heat level it the best way to get more.
[2023-01-04 06:15:55] <rayne2914> how do u go about making ur build in this game? i cant find one too good
[2023-01-04 06:16:30] <eternalpiemaker> If ur lazy u can just watch different speedruns ^, experimenting is 100 times more fun though.

[2023-01-04 06:45:40] <%nola_epeeist> @siscoross Yes. Haelian was the first to do it. That's on his YT channel. As is the video of the lead dev calling him to talk shit on an earlier failed attempt. He also did it with EM4 IIRC.
[2023-01-04 06:46:00] <%nola_epeeist> And Vorime beat the game in the first run on hell mode.
[2023-01-04 06:46:09] <eternalpiemaker> ^ he also had a bunch of rules when he did it. No athena or shield I believe.
[2023-01-04 06:46:10] <+i_am_takikumo> The Beowulf shield with the Aphrodite shard is crazy good too
[2023-01-04 06:46:17] <eternalpiemaker> For the no hit
[2023-01-04 06:46:30] <+i_am_takikumo> That's honestly what I use for the most part
[2023-01-04 06:46:41] <%nola_epeeist> There's also challenge mods like chamber 2 hades. current world record for that is a win with 50 damage (2 hits)

[2023-01-04 06:46:51] <+siscoross> i mean thats not a no hit thats a no hit no deflect no block lol
[2023-01-04 06:47:20] <eternalpiemaker> Depends on how you define hit, but yeah, he felt it was cheesy to use stuff like that for no hit.
[2023-01-04 06:47:46] <%nola_epeeist> @siscoross that stuff is usually considered the difference between no hit and no damage in the challenge runner community. So his rules make sense.
[2023-01-04 06:47:47] <sineporf> wreckless, but i appreciate the aggression
[2023-01-04 06:47:59] <+siscoross> idk the game differentiates it in the registration so I'd say its fair game but im also not someone that sits there hardcore grinding those runs
[2023-01-04 06:48:03] <@$Advanst_> more damage is always needed NODDERS
[2023-01-04 06:48:05] <!%Ebonslayer> @eternalpiemaker Many games do use those rules. It often defeats the point of no hit.

[2023-01-04 06:49:00] <eternalpiemaker> @Ebonslayer Only other popular game with no hit is the souls series which doesn't really have those rules.
[2023-01-04 06:49:18] <!%Ebonslayer> @eternalpiemaker Souls actually does have those rules. Blocks are strictly not allowed.
[2023-01-04 06:49:25] <!%Ebonslayer> @eternalpiemaker Parries are fine though.

[2023-01-04 06:50:01] <eternalpiemaker> Block is a hit with 0 damage, so yeah. Parries is definitely equal to something like athena, just way more skill.

[2023-01-04 06:53:28] <eternalpiemaker> Typically speaking, you have to record yourself dying before starting a speedrun, so rng manips are limited officially.
[2023-01-04 06:53:46] <eternalpiemaker> There is a seperate category for seeds though
[2023-01-04 06:53:48] <%nola_epeeist> @siscoross they used that analysis to make the official speedrun mod pack to eliminate needless resets and grinding.

[2023-01-04 07:05:31] <%nola_epeeist> @RickyRelucent The meta stuff isn't meta b/c of high damage at the end. It's meta because it's consistent and fast enough in the early biomes. Something that comes online in 3rd biome is too slow even if it does massive damage.
[2023-01-04 07:05:31] <MrPeer> shield with pos also rocks
[2023-01-04 07:06:10] <RickyRelucent> nodders, but its sad when it takes a feww biomes for your build to take off
[2023-01-04 07:06:30] <+siscoross> multi shield throw + ricochet on enemies + posedion is a loot of fun
[2023-01-04 07:06:33] <RickyRelucent> almost always better to focus 1 2 gods at the start, then start switching keepsakes
[2023-01-04 07:06:51] <%nola_epeeist> @RickyRelucent But realistically, beo with pos cast and mirage shot can consistently do enough damage to phase dad in one hit. That other stuff will get bigger number, but since he goes invulnerable, the extra damage doesn't actually do much besides be fun.

[2023-01-04 07:17:31] <+siscoross> aura damage reduction?
[2023-01-04 07:17:37] <faded1896> +100 w that sword and the collar Kreygasm
[2023-01-04 07:17:40] <zxthed> yeah
[2023-01-04 07:17:42] <Tylerjsmith97> @Oroboro it's SO good
[2023-01-04 07:17:43] <+MegaCookieOfDoom> You can win with only revenge lol
[2023-01-04 07:17:48] <%hokmon_> yeah it looks really similar
[2023-01-04 07:17:51] <+thedarthgecko> aphro and arty best build
[2023-01-04 07:18:02] <BitsySweet> it is slow but it has the highest base damage in the game
[2023-01-04 07:18:03] <%+GIHunter6> Those aren't charges, no
[2023-01-04 07:18:06] <%hokmon_> it is SLOW
[2023-01-04 07:18:06] <%+GIHunter6> That's just how slow they come out
[2023-01-04 07:18:08] <%darkspark33> That'd be my new favorite piece
[2023-01-04 07:18:10] <rightsidedown> just slow but hit hard
[2023-01-04 07:18:12] <BitsySweet> you can dash in-between strikes to so cancel animations and set up big swings after dash. doesn't get any dash-strike bonuses afaik tho
[2023-01-04 07:18:15] <+MegaCookieOfDoom> You can dash before last hit to aim for their back
[2023-01-04 07:18:18] <%hokmon_> there you go
[2023-01-04 07:18:18] <+Rxnin> Press special!
[2023-01-04 07:18:24] <RSomner> attack speed on this thing makes it truly busted
[2023-01-04 07:18:26] <Taciturn_Dragon> special special
[2023-01-04 07:18:27] <faded1896> Hades 2? I havent heard about that yet
[2023-01-04 07:18:29] <zxthed> you can attack twice, dash, then attack again for a quicker charge attack
[2023-01-04 07:18:41] <%$TheSortingHelmet> This is my favorite Weapon
[2023-01-04 07:18:47] <+siscoross> can you sumon multiple auras?
