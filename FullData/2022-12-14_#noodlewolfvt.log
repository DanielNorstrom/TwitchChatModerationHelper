[2022-12-14 20:31:39] <%reivehnfliyt> if you can, best thing you can do with an on coming tornado if you have no structural or solid protection it's best to pray and simply secure yourself to the ground as best you can, lay flat to the ground in such a way that rising currents can't get under your to give lift, ideally hold something. anchored to the ground very firmly, this is far from ideal but it beats being flung potentially many miles into hell knows what
[2022-12-14 20:31:49] <@%$Miikeyy115> so if you see a movie where people are in a room with a decent explosion, and they walk away fine, that is a huge lie cause they would have ruptured organs at the least

[2022-12-14 20:35:30] VIEWERS: 292
[2022-12-14 20:35:48] <!%admiral_frostbite> 60% water meaning 40% of the body is likely compressible, should dampen shockwave and catch shrapnel
[2022-12-14 20:36:16] <@%$Miikeyy115> In most cases it would, the body can absorb a lot and grenades are not really powerful explosives, just meant to send shrapnel everywhere
[2022-12-14 20:36:19] <%reivehnfliyt> fragmentation grenades are much less explosive and more about using shrapnel to damage their targets, HE and HF grenades are far more reliant on explosive force

[2022-12-14 20:44:13] <kurnas_86_plane_guy> There are a few wars I'm surprised we still don't have many movies for, those mostly taking place in the middle east. Stuff like the Six Day war, or Yom Kippur War
[2022-12-14 20:44:28] <@%$Miikeyy115> Like the Battle Of Okinawa was the bloodiest battle fought in the Pacific i believe

[2022-12-14 20:45:17] <kurnas_86_plane_guy> Oh, those are the wars I find really interesting. I have ties to that area (since I'm Jewish, and have cousins that live in Israel).  There was a lot of very interesting stuff, but also a ton of depressing stuff

[2022-12-14 20:45:46] <%reivehnfliyt> in ww1 Germans felt that shotguns were a breech of the Hague convention. their argument was that a shotgun is a weapon if undue torture and suffering as it was almost impossible to treat 28 small wounds instead of maybe one or two bullet wounds

[2022-12-14 20:46:29] <%+OrphanCain> the Marines just have a policy of only using them for breaching doors, but apparently down range there's a lot of doors standing around with guns
[2022-12-14 20:46:36] <Tadas13571> o did you know that kids in Japan don't properly learn about world was 2 until they are in there lait teen so there is a trend to dress up like natzes because Japan has a culture of admiring the USA and Germany because of how strong they were in WW2 but it's more like a fase until they learn what Germany actually did
[2022-12-14 20:46:48] <kurnas_86_plane_guy> Yeah The Arab-Israeli wars and Vietnam/Cold war are the ones I focus on, and even then, it's mostly just the aerial part (so aircraft). I'm only just now getting into the politics behind them

[2022-12-14 21:22:50] <Tadas13571> it was a shipping scam were I sent out an item and the person had to pay for it but the person didn't pay so I went back to the post office to get the item back but by the time that I got there the item was already taken away and apparently royal mail legal can not intercept an item so I just had to hope that they are not home when the dilivery happens and then I could redirect it to a post office were I can pick it up and get it back luckily they were not home and I had it sorted
[2022-12-14 21:22:53] <Tadas13571> sadly royal mail is currently on strike so the only date that I could have it dilivery to a post office is next Monday
