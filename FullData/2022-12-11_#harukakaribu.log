[2022-12-11 08:02:52] <venomthesunwonk> LORE (This is just a joke... maybe...): As young children Haruka and Dasher were close friends. Eventually as they got older their friendship grew in a more romantic way. As a relationship they were quite cute and a good couple. At some point Haruka and Dasher got in a huge fight for unknown reasons which ended badly, Years later Haruka seeks revenge by killing Dasher.

[2022-12-11 08:07:53] <%$I_Am_JarvisTM> You know, actually, I only recently discovered this via Froot, but apparently there's a sort of Hide And Seek thing for Apex, too, which is actually pretty neat honestly. It's not an actual game mode though so it's something to have to arrange ahead of time.
[2022-12-11 08:07:56] <%+briangruen5> Haruka, did you know that there’s a cult of dyslexic devil worshippers in the Ozarks who sold their souls to Santa? And no, I don’t believe it’s this one 😂

[2022-12-11 08:22:13] <%SpacemanPika> much more common than in US/Canada
[2022-12-11 08:22:14] <+D_Kaiju> Japan is all trains :D

[2022-12-11 08:22:26] <%wolfpackmn> There is a lot of highways and a lot of trains as well
[2022-12-11 08:22:26] <+owlieowl> This train is definitely more an experience than way to travel

[2022-12-11 08:22:47] <@%Cpl_Elemena> Japan is small so it works for them
[2022-12-11 08:22:48] <%+briangruen5> Because the US doesn’t want to have it
[2022-12-11 08:22:48] <%+ltcolinsane> because the airline companies don't like that
[2022-12-11 08:22:49] <Dr_Mooose> distance + money

[2022-12-11 08:24:25] <%$I_Am_JarvisTM> That's not bad honestly, for the size of an island nation
[2022-12-11 08:24:27] <mikeygonzales> I very will travel to Tokyo to enjoy those Delicious Japanese food  looks very delicious

[2022-12-11 08:24:47] <+Walopoh> you should check out one of the comparison websites.
[2022-12-11 08:24:52] <+crowbar777> Come visit us in Cali we are friendly here I swear.
[2022-12-11 08:24:52] <%+RushRacing_> Cali has more people than Canada lol
[2022-12-11 08:24:52] <%$I_Am_JarvisTM> California is like... top ten largest US states
[2022-12-11 08:24:53] <%Minanonn> Out of curiosity - have you heard of a YT channel called 1bike1world? Cycling adventures of a Scotsman and (eventually) his formerly stray cat Nala
[2022-12-11 08:24:55] <%Just_Reboot> I was asked to compare America to Japan once by a Japanese friend. I said 'America is bigger in every way, and more of a bummer'
[2022-12-11 08:24:55] <%Fluffyshinigami> I'd love to visit Canada TBH
[2022-12-11 08:24:56] <GKNolan> Yeah but 90% of it is mountainous and nigh-ninhabilitable.

[2022-12-11 08:25:10] <%kyulen742> that is a very tiny restroom, but i guess it makes sense since it's on a train
[2022-12-11 08:25:10] <%$JonCipher> The reason why Japan relies on trains is that there are not a lot of space in Japan compared to United States and Canada which have a lot of space

[2022-12-11 08:28:39] <%$I_Am_JarvisTM> Okay, so Japan is actually closer in size to Montana, which is 147k square miles as opposed to Japan's 145.9k square miles, though California does have the similar shape, so it's an understandable comparison

[2022-12-11 09:38:22] <@%+Sery_Bot> Researchers are unsure exactly how a cat purrs. Most veterinarians believe that a cat purrs by vibrating vocal folds deep in the throat. To do this, a muscle in the larynx opens and closes the air passage about 25 times per second.

[2022-12-11 09:59:23] <%+asthetic_se> LAX isn't the worst airport it's Newark. It's always under construction and it's an absolute cluster
[2022-12-11 09:59:23] <%+scud_dumpster> The airline you use doesnt really matter
[2022-12-11 09:59:23] <+owlieowl> I'd avoid flying directly into LA if you have to
[2022-12-11 09:59:23] <Potatorican> LAX is fine if you're using it as a connector, otherwise it sucks ass
[2022-12-11 09:59:24] <%$kusaland_ceo> Just Drive it'll be funner

[2022-12-11 09:59:29] <%thekingrulz9090> Just gotta walk at this point
[2022-12-11 09:59:30] <%avfusion> Alaska flies out of most Canadian airports

[2022-12-11 10:12:45] <%SpacemanPika> cooked sushi is oddly fine (but thats not really sushi)

[2022-12-11 10:23:09] <%thekingrulz9090> Cheer300 I had something on my mind, but I already completely forgot what it was. So instead, I'll just leave you with a little fun fact that I just realized right now. So you had your debut last Saturday, which lined up with my resub anniversary, I don't know if that was pure coincidence, or did you plan this out? If I do remember what that though was from before, but i'll let u know. Good night Haruka
