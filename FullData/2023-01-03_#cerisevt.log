[2023-01-03 13:16:35] <@%LT_Jakal> all of Vermintide was just Nurgle too wasn't it?
[2023-01-03 13:16:55] <$sircool099> vermintide added chaos warriors and beastmen later on
[2023-01-03 13:17:04] <@%LT_Jakal> Vermintide had Rats, Beastmen and the Rotblood North Men
[2023-01-03 13:17:10] <%Iffiie> rats have their own gods
[2023-01-03 13:17:21] <!%$Pikinator> id love to see them add genestealers to this
[2023-01-03 13:17:24] <!%$Pikinator> it would work so well
[2023-01-03 13:18:11] VIEWERS: 184
[2023-01-03 13:18:12] <$sircool099> oh, genestealers would be neat, but could it be handled at the power level of the grunts you play?
[2023-01-03 13:19:04] <$sircool099> the grunts we play couldn't handle a chaos marine tbh
[2023-01-03 13:19:17] <bunglinglummox> Sweetie, they handle *demonhosts*

[2023-01-03 13:19:53] <@%LT_Jakal> but yes that is a thing
[2023-01-03 13:20:11] VIEWERS: 184
[2023-01-03 13:20:16] <$sircool099> are demon hosts stronger than chaos marines? I don't really know the comparison that could be
[2023-01-03 13:20:58] <!%$Pikinator> in reality yes
[2023-01-03 13:21:02] <%Iffiie> yes demon hosts are stronger
[2023-01-03 13:21:09] <!%$Pikinator> a daemon host is infinitely more dangerous than a single chaos marine
[2023-01-03 13:21:11] <bunglinglummox> Demonhosts are extremely dangerous. It's technically possible to bind a demon who wouldn't be, but in practice anything less than a major demon doesn't get bound because they become useless.

[2023-01-03 13:22:56] <%Iffiie> the box is so funny tho yokaiLUL
[2023-01-03 13:23:14] <bunglinglummox> Per wki "With few exceptions, the daemon bound within a host is potent, on the level of a Herald or Daemon Prince, because the wards and bindings that enslave a Daemonhost also fetter its power. A Lesser Daemon bound to a host is weaker than that Daemon would be otherwise, and seldom worth the risk of summoning and binding in the first place."

[2023-01-03 13:24:05] <$sircool099> 40k, it's pretty much the same but not as many returning characters. I think only the chaos gods and SKARBRAND are the biggest things in both fantasy and 40k
