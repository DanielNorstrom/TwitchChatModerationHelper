[2022-12-27 09:22:20] <%+Zithras2> Terraria was like that too, but well made arenas helped ALOT.  This game doesnt really seem to let you make boss arenas :(
[2022-12-27 09:22:38] <PizzaHi5> yeah not like terraria

[2022-12-27 09:25:25] <%+Zithras2> maybe if he breaks a wall with ore in it it drops the ore?
[2022-12-27 09:25:54] <%+Zithras2> which means you could speedmine ore with him!
