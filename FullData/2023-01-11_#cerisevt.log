[2023-01-11 11:57:27] <Carridin> That's a quick way to get people into Pathfinder, instead.

[2023-01-11 11:58:43] <@TheKneecapKnabber> there is a hydra btw that you can unlock but it might be hard
[2023-01-11 11:58:49] <Chanakarl> what are good tips for beginners? i just play it yesterday.
[2023-01-11 11:59:21] <@%$CheeseToastiesPlz> yokaiMemo waaNotes
[2023-01-11 11:59:22] <%+ZukaZealanee> @Chanakarl kill things, don't die
[2023-01-11 11:59:41] <@TheKneecapKnabber> play more and buy upgrade (and don't die)
[2023-01-11 12:00:08] <Darkfirephoenix> Just rushing for more items isn't the best way to play. Often it is far better to just upgrade the items you already have
[2023-01-11 12:00:17] <Carridin> And if you do die, that's okay. It's just better to not.
[2023-01-11 12:00:28] <%+ZukaZealanee> save up for the extra projectile upgrade first, super op

[2023-01-11 12:01:25] <%FinalCipher> double whip! i bet they combine
[2023-01-11 12:01:57] <%FinalCipher> well you've got an up down nuke, may as well add side nukes
[2023-01-11 12:02:02] <Chanakarl> made me want to play old Castlevania games.
[2023-01-11 12:02:27] <%FinalCipher> yeah castlevania's wall chicken inspired the floor chicken
[2023-01-11 12:02:41] VIEWERS: 175
[2023-01-11 12:03:01] <Carridin> The absolutely key thing is to play it. It's the roguelike staple; learn, accrue power, and then luck out with the alignment of everything in your favour.
