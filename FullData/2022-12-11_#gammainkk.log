[2022-12-11 11:03:38] <%+purr_lude> @shypotatoboy yeah. i always hated guitar hero because of it.
[2022-12-11 11:04:30] <%shypotatoboy> For me, it just takes a bit to adjust and focus. Still, it feels awkward at times and when I think I do have the rhythm, I begin to screw up.

[2022-12-11 11:05:25] <%+purr_lude> most rhythm games have latency adjustment now but sometimes it takes a while to get things to match, and then there will still end up a difference between speaker audio and headphones

[2022-12-11 12:46:57] <NicoRakshasa> tbf I think it's confusing because creamer just refers to the component of coffee that's fat. You can use milk, powdered milk, pre-sweetened cream, half an half (half cream and half whole milk)
[2022-12-11 12:46:57] <hollowlian> *and hi chat?

[2022-12-11 12:47:54] <DeadPixel21> cream is just a thicker milk thoough
[2022-12-11 12:48:01] <NicoRakshasa> it's made to reduce the acidic component in the coffee
[2022-12-11 12:48:18] <%Chaostyrant87> nah its friggen weird
[2022-12-11 12:48:18] <DeadPixel21> yes

[2022-12-11 12:48:39] <+Psymon12> I think you're concentrating too much on the cream part of creamer. It's more of a diluted milk.
