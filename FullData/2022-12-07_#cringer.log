[2022-12-07 17:34:03] <%Arazaki> ah, in classic it would hide it away until you actually found, guess its a change for steam
[2022-12-07 17:34:11] <%+wikes60> you will need something to make coal I believe
[2022-12-07 17:34:17] <+ranger225500> magma stuff need no fuel
[2022-12-07 17:35:03] <+Ryoku_23> I have heard some absolutely ludicrous things can happen in this game.
[2022-12-07 17:35:12] <Larren_DeCosta> is it wrong that the graphics and animations of this game reminds me of the game SimAnt from 1991?
[2022-12-07 17:35:16] <+PumperPixel> ahhaha de nada hombre
[2022-12-07 17:35:26] <%+wikes60> Does clicking on a stone tell you if it can produce a metal?
[2022-12-07 17:35:53] <%+wikes60> yeah yeah

[2022-12-07 17:38:22] <+Sw1tched> oh wow how intuitive. tanks FeelsFunnyMan
[2022-12-07 17:38:31] <%Wraldpyk> do other zones have sub-zones?

[2022-12-07 17:40:03] <%Arazaki> stone cutters are smoothers and tracks/fortification, stone carvers make furniture, masons make rock blocks. i only found out late last night

[2022-12-07 17:42:03] <%Arazaki> coke for steel. iron -> pig iron -> steel
[2022-12-07 17:42:21] <%wickwrack> don't make too many coins, just a bit
[2022-12-07 17:42:24] <%Oskatatv2> There was an attempt at making an economy with coins and a mint and wages for different jobs some versions of DF back. It turned out to be somewhat buggy and very unpopular with the players, so it was abandoned. The coins remain as something to spend metal on
[2022-12-07 17:42:31] <rene_a_77> no one, coke for extra energy
[2022-12-07 17:42:51] <%Arazaki> for those in chat wondering, open up the metal page in the wiki, prepare for info dump

[2022-12-07 17:43:26] <%Arazaki> hematite, magnetite, limonite are iron
[2022-12-07 17:43:42] <%Wraldpyk> did you know you can collapse a section in that overview of the rock-list by clicking on the different coloured header
[2022-12-07 17:43:47] <%+wikes60> you may want to create like a bar storage area by the smelter
[2022-12-07 17:43:57] <%+wikes60> to cut down on hauling back and forth

[2022-12-07 17:44:11] <Whisperio> Coins are loaded into a minecart, the cart then loaded a few z-levels up, rolled down to an abrupt stop into the waiting pockets and eyes and inner organs of trader elves
[2022-12-07 17:44:47] <%Oskatatv2> ah yes, that too, coins and other small items can be weaponized
[2022-12-07 17:44:54] <%Arazaki> shotgun minecarts, its a feat i've yet to try
[2022-12-07 17:44:57] <%JohnDoeRadio> oh snap
[2022-12-07 17:45:03] <%JohnDoeRadio> wow

[2022-12-07 17:46:32] <%+BoredToBeers> are your dwarves wearing them?
[2022-12-07 17:47:14] <%Oskatatv2> you can make a dodge trap @JohnDoeRadio set up a narrow walkway over a deep pit with overhang, with maybe some traps, and crossbow dwarfs shooting at whatever walks on them. When they dodge a shot or trap, they have a chance to jump off the walkway
[2022-12-07 17:47:51] <warchild421> Any bear shells though?

[2022-12-07 17:48:18] <%JohnDoeRadio> nice thanks
[2022-12-07 17:48:50] <%+wikes60> @JohnDoeRadio you can also build a draw bridge that smashes things
[2022-12-07 17:49:11] <Larren_DeCosta> can you eat the elves?
[2022-12-07 17:49:51] <%Oskatatv2> @Larren_DeCosta dwarfs won't eat sapients. Not without some modding or editing of game files. Elves don't share that reservation
[2022-12-07 17:50:00] VIEWERS: 908
[2022-12-07 17:50:06] <%Grunkzzz> I tried to trade with them and they were very particular about what I could sell them and got huffy and left
[2022-12-07 17:50:29] <%Oskatatv2> ah yes, elves don't like it when you sell them wood stuff
[2022-12-07 17:50:58] <%Oskatatv2> their own wooden stuff is organically grown wood, they don't want your crude industrialized destruction wood things
[2022-12-07 17:51:08] <Larren_DeCosta> must be beer stains included
[2022-12-07 17:51:21] <GrodenGreaseman> Is there a dragon under the mountain?

[2022-12-07 17:52:54] <%Oskatatv2> copper crossbows and wooden bolts are usually enough against most wildlife @JohnDoeRadio
[2022-12-07 17:53:11] <%+FataltheBaptist> Any more turtles, r They domesticated
[2022-12-07 17:53:22] <HiFiPanda> Beat elves into pulp, force them to buy wooden stuff
[2022-12-07 17:53:33] <%gamerclint> a forge for a kid? monkaS
[2022-12-07 17:53:58] <zoeyzanidoo> that crushed miner was there when we started construction...

[2022-12-07 17:54:03] <%Arazaki> rope: chains (which can be placed and animals or criminals tethered), wells, traction benches
[2022-12-07 17:54:03] <%Oskatatv2> also, you can tell a soldier to use a pickaxe as a weapon @JohnDoeRadio experienced miners are a force to be feared in the dwarf army
[2022-12-07 17:54:16] <2908_Juno> spices PogChamp
[2022-12-07 17:54:50] <2908_Juno> having low birth rates? Spike the water with red sang KKona
[2022-12-07 17:54:54] <%JohnDoeRadio> how do you give the dwarves weapons outside of the miltia though?
[2022-12-07 17:54:59] <%Bux0> Lots of cloth and leather, nice.
[2022-12-07 17:55:03] <%Arazaki> clothe the masses!!
[2022-12-07 17:55:30] <HiFiPanda> Give your dwarves weapons, they still gonna use their teeth in combat KEKW
[2022-12-07 17:55:44] <%Arazaki> you can make wooden and bone bolts for training your marksdwarves
[2022-12-07 17:55:58] <Bkulan> You can make them all woodcutters and make some really nice axes and they will use them as civilians to defend themselves
[2022-12-07 17:56:01] VIEWERS: 941
[2022-12-07 17:56:20] <%JohnDoeRadio> oh snap, thats a good idea
[2022-12-07 17:56:28] <%Arazaki> cheese grommet, cheese!
[2022-12-07 17:56:32] <%JohnDoeRadio> @HiFiPanda HAHA
[2022-12-07 17:56:32] <+Sw1tched> Can dwarfes still work if they are designated fighters?
[2022-12-07 17:56:43] <Larren_DeCosta> enormous corkscrew?
[2022-12-07 17:56:50] <Bkulan> Same for miners, if all your dwarves can mine then they all carry a pickaxe that is a decent weapon
[2022-12-07 17:56:57] <Vars95> Huge
[2022-12-07 17:57:08] <%+FataltheBaptist> Cringer is out of control
