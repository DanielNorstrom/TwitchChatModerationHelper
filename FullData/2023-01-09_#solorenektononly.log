[2023-01-09 19:49:37] <%the_misanthrope13> team got dicked
[2023-01-09 19:49:49] <%Darth_Mack92> you get kass shield when Q is clicked now, not when it hits something
[2023-01-09 19:49:58] <!%hossxox> same thing for gp with sheen @BaldestCanadian if you Q a minion but it died , Q dosnt go off or lose mana but you get a sheen effect on you
[2023-01-09 19:50:01] <%Darth_Mack92> they made a bunch of quality of life changes to kass like 2-3 patches ago
[2023-01-09 19:50:05] <!%hossxox> its prob like that for other champions

[2023-01-09 19:51:41] <bloodyseth> @SoloRenektonOnly do you find you have enough mana without two mana items? Since presence of mind exists I always kind of though it was a bit overkill, although rod will be strong next patch

[2023-01-09 20:25:08] <UnkleJiggy> Yea, nothing makes me feel better than FF'ing a probably lost game at 15 minutes to run it back....
[2023-01-09 20:25:11] <haydenh19> the majority of players play for 3-4 hours, if you're giving up 4-5 of those at 15 minutes to save time for an extra game, you're probably tilted anyways and you'll just lose the extra games
[2023-01-09 20:25:13] <%the_misanthrope13> but mike they have more kills they are better Kappa
[2023-01-09 20:25:14] <%+malkraven> but if your botlane is 0-6 in 5 mins u know its done
[2023-01-09 20:25:22] <%+Diamonddusts> You even see it in Pro play too, it looks so 1 sided and then BOOM the other team wins o.o

[2023-01-09 21:27:03] <Pekoneko117> Have you tried Illaoi with Riftmaker,? You deal more dmg with AD + true dmg form riftmaker than going only AD xDD

[2023-01-09 21:27:07] <%PlutonicPoltergeist> There is NO communication about the changes, why they made them, etc
[2023-01-09 21:27:12] <%ItzYaBoi34> Didnt they swap LCS with Valorant? I think Val is more popular in NA.
[2023-01-09 21:27:19] <Sqeezle55> it's spring split, so it probably has lower viewership anyways
