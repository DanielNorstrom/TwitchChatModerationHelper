[2023-01-05 15:40:01] <@%Eyohna> even if karjen is indeed a hunter god, it should be allowed to have any AT
[2023-01-05 15:40:02] <%tarpor_> I'd like to see them do a -Author didnt drive AT, but this aint it

[2023-01-05 16:30:49] <Zere_> This rule also applies to matchmaking, then?
[2023-01-05 16:30:53] <%Blarrgz> doesn't it say in the rulebook that the wallbang has to be intentional?

[2023-01-05 16:31:43] <%+Shokkaaa> It's kinda the same with track and field runners. You do not necessarily gain an advantage by cutting into another track, but it can happen - therefore "cut into other track - DQ". Same logic applied here I think.

[2023-01-05 16:57:13] <%19Vendetta95> They need to make Champion medal a real thing for maps, so AT can be a nice time but you don't lose the real challenge

[2023-01-05 16:57:58] <Chezuss> ATs should be community controlled. If they want to worry about prestige medals, they should stick to golds

[2023-01-05 16:58:12] <Norbinarius> Developer anwsered me about this on reddit, it's an issue and will be fixed in upcoming weeks. So you can claim TOTD medals later on for prestige skin.
[2023-01-05 16:58:13] <%TheNewManInYourLife> Yeah. Get better bozos
[2023-01-05 16:58:17] <+JRodslegend> The author medal on the nascar red track is pretty filthy, Ill never get that one
[2023-01-05 16:58:18] <%7x9x0> its so annoying when companies try to make everything accessible to everybody, completely defeating the point of something being an actual achievement.
[2023-01-05 16:58:23] <%ShcrTM> so on a map i've been working with sophie since april 2022 that will never get totd because the AT is gonna be too hard, sounds fair, it had a disaster IRL backstory to it
[2023-01-05 16:58:24] <ViggyNash> The medals should be a reflection of relative skill, so yeah most people cant get AT, thats how it should be

[2023-01-05 16:58:58] <bigjoshfamous> I only cared about medals the very first campaign I played, and getting all ATs was satisfying that first campaign
[2023-01-05 16:58:59] <Cabinss> I guess for the full completionists they want to have very skin, but do "regular" people really care about those dings?

[2023-01-05 16:59:00] <@^StreamElements> Back at it again with some 'Track of the Day' author hunting. Check out !medals to see the most difficult author medals in the campaign and my personal best on !midori - Before you ask, https://www.author-tracker.com uses a different medal for Midori compared to the ingame one. The goal is to just gather the available ones slow and steadily.

[2023-01-05 17:00:05] <%ShcrTM> probably yes
[2023-01-05 17:00:06] <MrPot4to> and if they could pay for them they would totally do it
[2023-01-05 17:00:08] <%+unanimousindecision> Can you just download the skin and send it to me
[2023-01-05 17:00:09] <BluBarry4> Spam malding cause he can't get this AT for his skin xdd
[2023-01-05 17:00:10] <Magpie_AI> This AT is way too hard for most players
[2023-01-05 17:00:12] <Jenda1337> @Spammiej when did you get neo cupra?
[2023-01-05 17:00:16] <Cabinss> I would say so
[2023-01-05 17:00:16] <%TheNewManInYourLife> Nadeo can fix this by making the premium skins cost money OR be earned with ATs @Spammiej
[2023-01-05 17:00:16] <%IntaxTM> my AT wasnt hard Sadge
[2023-01-05 17:00:17] <%SirRobin___> add a prestige medal for the skin that is somewhere between gold and author i guess
[2023-01-05 17:00:20] <The_BraveTitan> Same thing with that Wirtychan map probably
[2023-01-05 17:00:24] <kraazy_kid97> the issue is attaching "official nadeo" skins to player-made TOTD tracks imo

[2023-01-05 17:00:35] <Magpie_AI> Most ATs where fewer than 100 people have it are too hard imo

[2023-01-05 17:00:36] <Razitchi> i mean didnt you at one point say, that ATs shouldnt be so hard that its only a handful of people who will ever get it?
[2023-01-05 17:00:38] <+KStu82> the people complaining about totd ATs being too hard probably don't even have winter 21 AT xdd
[2023-01-05 17:00:39] <%mime_> idk weird, there is many people that can get that prestige gold dings skin
[2023-01-05 17:00:40] <@%Alliance> Maybe I should set the ATs, hire me mappers! winke
[2023-01-05 17:00:42] <ViggyNash> @kraazy_kid97 xdd 100% this

[2023-01-05 17:00:43] <%+BirdieTM> champ medal introduced in-game can be a good idea maybe
[2023-01-05 17:00:44] <%mime_> author should be for the real grindahs
[2023-01-05 17:00:49] <%+BirdieTM> ^
[2023-01-05 17:00:49] <+lostpebble> they need to maybe make a new prestige medal
[2023-01-05 17:00:51] <%BigML> I mean if it was a karjen at... if he hunted it badly, who even has a chance to get it KEKW
[2023-01-05 17:00:52] <scheiterhaufen_aus_money> @TheNewManInYourLife its a prestige skin tho so you it would be dumb to be able buy them
[2023-01-05 17:00:53] <DacuberTM> naa
[2023-01-05 17:00:54] <BigthirstyTM> literally every FS AT at this moment
[2023-01-05 17:00:57] <%SirRobin___> true
[2023-01-05 17:00:58] <dadadadadap> or make top 100 or something
[2023-01-05 17:01:03] <DacuberTM> there are people who edit medal times
[2023-01-05 17:01:09] <%tarpor_> this increases the chances of speq getting totd because his ATs are dogshit
[2023-01-05 17:01:10] <bd_raoul> make gold medals a little harder or  actually introduce champion medals for the insane times
[2023-01-05 17:01:10] <BluBarry4> Make it so basic skin is just playing a map and make the cool skin up to gold? idk I'm just a widdle guy
[2023-01-05 17:01:15] <Chezuss> maybe they can add a challenge medal
[2023-01-05 17:01:18] <%ShcrTM> it's not called prestige for nothing

[2023-01-05 17:01:26] <%mime_> @DacuberTM still doesnt make the gold impossible 99% time
[2023-01-05 17:01:29] <Magpie_AI> Almost every FS and ice AT are way beyond casuals
[2023-01-05 17:01:30] <%vlees> PepoG players make maps
[2023-01-05 17:01:38] <%scuba_scones> make gold medals harder imo rather than authors easier
[2023-01-05 17:01:39] <vlees> nadeoDown too hard AT
[2023-01-05 17:01:40] <%PiercyTTV> IMO the jump between gold and AT can be quite large, it'd be nice if gold was a little harder and AT just stayed as they are. Then have prestige use gold
[2023-01-05 17:01:44] <%tarpor_> ye and nadeo decides if they want it as totd? its their vision
[2023-01-05 17:01:44] <%+Sampler30> 100%
[2023-01-05 17:01:45] <kraazy_kid97> exactly
[2023-01-05 17:01:54] <%TheNewManInYourLife> @scheiterhaufen_aus_money most people do not care about the prestige skin anyway. Let people that complain about the game being hard buy them
[2023-01-05 17:01:54] <%tabooConcept> hope the person checking is good on your map's style and Prayge
[2023-01-05 17:01:57] <v_ppooww> @AurisTFG these people would go crazy about diamonds xdd
[2023-01-05 17:02:05] <%Keissla> youre still free to make maps with hard ATs, they just wont be TOTD i guess
[2023-01-05 17:02:11] <%Blarrgz> "AT is too hard" makes no sense. Basically the same as saying "your time is too good" on your own map lol
[2023-01-05 17:02:12] <!%Nsgr> Chatting if the map doesnt have x finishers after the 24h its too hard
[2023-01-05 17:02:12] <DacuberTM> man at this rate every AT is gonna be a freebie... what will I have left to strive for
[2023-01-05 17:02:13] <Razitchi> but would you like it if the AT was so good, that it would never be achieved?
[2023-01-05 17:02:14] <+DennissTM> AT medals shouldn't be part of the prestige skins, setting rules on that just removes the "author" part of the AT
[2023-01-05 17:02:14] <scheiterhaufen_aus_money> @TheNewManInYourLife why even have them in the first place then HUH
[2023-01-05 17:02:14] <pinfel> bronze and silver medals are irrelevant for most ppl so u only have 2 medals
[2023-01-05 17:02:15] <Magpie_AI> @PiercyTTV agree, the gold- AT gap can be stupid. Gold is usually free within minutes

[2023-01-05 17:02:22] <ViggyNash> Instead of judging AT medals, just make a separate medal for the Nadeo official time on a track
[2023-01-05 17:02:28] <Gertzik> don't submit the map for TOTD then. At this point you need to think of TOTDs as community-made campaigns
[2023-01-05 17:02:34] <%johnara2002> i mean how many ppl will play the map if its not cotd
[2023-01-05 17:02:35] <Gertzik> official campaign*+
[2023-01-05 17:02:37] <%jethrobaggins> then whos gonna play it?

[2023-01-05 17:02:43] <DacuberTM> most players build for TOTD because they want players to play them
[2023-01-05 17:02:44] <%Silver_star12> The whole point is to drive fast for trackmania... Now they basically destroy the biggest part of their game
[2023-01-05 17:02:45] <%Grmigrim> Personally I think Nadeo should drive a medal themselves on every totd. I dont know how much work that would be, but that way we could one more medal and avoid any issues that come with this, no?
[2023-01-05 17:02:46] <%JesseW070> why would you make totd worthy maps but drive a shit at cus you have to
[2023-01-05 17:02:47] <%Keissla> I mean thats most maps tbh LUL
[2023-01-05 17:02:48] <v_ppooww> braindead decision
[2023-01-05 17:02:51] <The_BraveTitan> Why doesn't Nadeo just decide w/e the time is they want for some medal then? use the Gold medals like you said or make up something inbetween AT and Gold

[2023-01-05 17:02:52] <MrPot4to> I think what Nadeo wants to say is that ATs should be proof that you can master the track, not a wr hunt, but it came out wrong? Just Chatting here
[2023-01-05 17:02:55] <z1gris> what is with the title
[2023-01-05 17:02:55] <%tarpor_> there's hundreds of maps that dont get totd ?
[2023-01-05 17:02:56] <SryoZz> maybe some kind of validation time which limited you not to take forever to set AT's?
[2023-01-05 17:02:56] <%mime_> @Grmigrim what
[2023-01-05 17:03:01] <CrerisRs> make 25 maps put them to a mappack and then just run bingo on that pack all day
[2023-01-05 17:03:01] <%BigML> how about we get progress for every single medal, no matter if bronze or AT (higher medal could progress more), that way lower skill players can still get skins just slower.
[2023-01-05 17:03:04] <bd_raoul> @Grmigrim i like this, a seperate nadeo AT
[2023-01-05 17:03:04] <%Keissla> But i understand what you mean
[2023-01-05 17:03:05] <%arppaax> Making hard ATs so once in a blue moon someones RMC run dies on it xdd
[2023-01-05 17:03:05] <yxhuvud> can't they just make so that top N finishers get the trophy regardless of medal?

[2023-01-05 17:03:20] <DacuberTM> it's not the goal
[2023-01-05 17:03:23] <Hedgedogue> my opinion as a dogshit player, is that challenging times to get just give you an objective to get to. challenge is good, and if you're not good enough you're not good enough thats it. I cant get half the campain medals but im grinding to get each of em and thats neat
[2023-01-05 17:03:23] <DacuberTM> it's the method
[2023-01-05 17:03:24] <%TheNewManInYourLife> @scheiterhaufen_aus_money There is no reason to have them. Just like there is no reason to have all At medals
[2023-01-05 17:03:25] <Cabinss> @Grmigrim Think this might be a good idea actually
[2023-01-05 17:03:25] <%tabooConcept> That's kinda funny considering the cupra tech map
[2023-01-05 17:03:32] <BluBarry4> @Grmigrim nadeo employee when theyre asked to set the time on a troll map voices
[2023-01-05 17:03:34] <%vlees> maybe make a map that uses a code execution exploit to change AT if it detects being TOTD HACKERMANS
[2023-01-05 17:03:37] <DacuberTM> the goal is to get players to play your map. TOTD is one of the best methods to achieve that
[2023-01-05 17:03:44] <%Cendius> I think the skins shouldn't be linked to user made maps, just Nadeo maps.
[2023-01-05 17:03:44] <%7x9x0> they introduced AT medals then wanna push the brakes when the A drives a fast T lel
[2023-01-05 17:03:44] <%johnara2002> give it time maybe its one time thingy Prayge
[2023-01-05 17:03:53] <%+porl_ger91> I don't get the Complaint of these People. For example I got a Top 100 World Time pn the Dirt map 2 Days ago (Tencho by Intax) but I wasn't even close to AT Time..I was still super proud of this Time. SO Kudos to all People who got AT on this Map! ...Prestige Skins have a higher Meaning then...with harder ATs
[2023-01-05 17:04:00] <helipod0> What if Nadeo could set the gold medals on TOTD? IDK
[2023-01-05 17:04:00] <%TheNewManInYourLife> People just want a participation AT trophy
[2023-01-05 17:04:08] <%Silver_star12> It's way more fun if it's challenging rather than just try for 5 minutes, get it and think you're a pro
[2023-01-05 17:04:09] <%IntaxTM> just checked the map out and the AT is rly hard YEP BUT, its legit the perfect map for the totd imo
[2023-01-05 17:04:10] <hachikuku> AAAAAAAAA I WANT THE AT MEDAL NOW WHY ARE YOU A GOOD PLAYER MAKE THE AT MEDAL EASIER SO I CAN SCREENSHOT AND PUT IT ON REDDIT FOR UPVOTES IW ANT THE AT GIVE ME THE AT NOW !!!!!
[2023-01-05 17:04:13] <scheiterhaufen_aus_money> @TheNewManInYourLife i dont get ur reasoning but ok
[2023-01-05 17:04:18] <hafusion> idk how people can complain about hard ATs, the difficulty makes earning ATs prestigous and rewarding
[2023-01-05 17:04:24] <mhrz_> @hachikuku xdd
[2023-01-05 17:04:25] <v_ppooww> i should make the decisions.

[2023-01-05 17:04:30] <%pokejulius> Redditing
[2023-01-05 17:04:31] <Cabinss> Also a bit strange that Nadeo, who have been profiting from the community with the success of COTD, that they are now limiting authors basically, doesnt make sense
[2023-01-05 17:04:45] <scheiterhaufen_aus_money> @hachikuku xpp
[2023-01-05 17:04:46] <%tarpor_> I mean the map you're playing right now shows that it's a one time thing? if they dont want any hard ATs they wouldnt have picked this, but karjen's AT is so over the top that they just dont want that
[2023-01-05 17:04:53] <DacuberTM> I don't understand why nadeo wants to put skins behind TOTD medals anyway... they should know TOTD medal times range from super slow to super fast
[2023-01-05 17:05:01] <%IntaxTM> now im gonna be scared of grinding the AT ok thank u nando
[2023-01-05 17:05:03] <%tarpor_> @DacuberTM yep
[2023-01-05 17:05:06] <%steengarden> wait what are we takling about? just got here
[2023-01-05 17:05:13] <%Silver_star12> With really bad AT's it's also possible that the maps aren't really calculated and then the good players just rage
[2023-01-05 17:05:16] <+Steffla> tbh I like more I like that ATs are a challenge - before it was just another name for gold, now it's actually worth something
[2023-01-05 17:05:17] <DacuberTM> like I can now also see players getting "AT too easy" comments but they just can't drive faster than that
[2023-01-05 17:05:17] <@^StreamElements> COPIUM
[2023-01-05 17:05:17] <Gertzik> @Cabinss it isn't strange. The prestige skins have potential to increse TOTD player count much more than AT hunting
[2023-01-05 17:05:21] VIEWERS: 1 008
[2023-01-05 17:05:37] <%Grmigrim> What I said will never happen though. Too much effort for nadeo I think.
[2023-01-05 17:05:43] <%+GrdAlf> no mechanics should be tied to something invisible in vanilla game. Console players will never know what the AT is even
[2023-01-05 17:05:43] <mhrz_> i guess midori AT wasn't that hard for nando guy mhm? xpp
[2023-01-05 17:05:48] <%saghzs> this map could have been chosen a week ago already
[2023-01-05 17:05:49] <%+smiQii> perhaps there should be 2 systems: mm rank you get prestige skins. Rank you level up for just playing anything + other skins
[2023-01-05 17:05:52] <%saghzs> doesnt prove anything
[2023-01-05 17:05:53] <%7x9x0> if nadeo needs some nascar maps with avg at's just hit me up man guuut
[2023-01-05 17:05:53] <helipod0> Chatting What if we introduce microtransactions to boost engine power?
[2023-01-05 17:05:55] <scheiterhaufen_aus_money> totd review surely isnt 1 perso
[2023-01-05 17:05:55] <InsaniityTM> I think this map was picked before the dings
[2023-01-05 17:05:57] <%tarpor_> no its a hard AT but not too hard in their opinion, I reckon
[2023-01-05 17:05:58] <%patricktm> @tarpor_ but how do they know if an at is hard, i dont think they play the maps before themselves
[2023-01-05 17:05:58] <+Garbooh> supah free AT
[2023-01-05 17:06:01] <%+boltdan> they're called prestige skins not everyone should have the skins
[2023-01-05 17:06:09] <Razitchi> maybe the KarjeN time is so good it will allegedly never be beaten
[2023-01-05 17:06:17] <Hedgedogue> this AT is insane lol
[2023-01-05 17:06:17] <BluBarry4> Nadeo will say an AT can't be too hard then change the physics and make ATs impossible
[2023-01-05 17:06:17] <DacuberTM> @mhrz_ naa, that map was just before they introduced prestige skins so they didn't need to care yet
[2023-01-05 17:06:25] <%Silver_star12> What's the point of the skins when everyone can get it... even with only a few hours of gametime
[2023-01-05 17:06:25] <@%Eyohna> any time can be beaten
[2023-01-05 17:06:26] <v_ppooww> im super hard rn
[2023-01-05 17:06:28] <Erooop> Can someone TL:DR what's happening with AT's or somewhere I can read aobut it

[2023-01-05 17:06:35] <%jethrobaggins> maybe the change for hard AT came after this map was selected

[2023-01-05 17:06:42] <%7x9x0> people said chroma's map was never gonna get beaten and it was beaten multiple times over. someone is always faster eventually.
[2023-01-05 17:06:42] <%AzYmuthS> I don't think Nadeo has a fs player that can judge AT on fs maps
[2023-01-05 17:06:43] <%IntaxTM> they legit punched me in my face and said "ur AT was decent at best" with this  widepeepoSad
[2023-01-05 17:06:45] <Gertzik> @boltdan but I don't think that it should be a thing that only 6 players can achieve

[2023-01-05 17:06:49] <%tarpor_> I see people typing here like every random person will just get the prestige skins now when we just had a hard af dirt map AT and a hard fullspeed map AT
[2023-01-05 17:06:52] <%19Vendetta95> I'd like to see Karjen's AT now

[2023-01-05 17:07:32] <Razitchi> is Nadeo even able to determine how good an AT is compared to top level players?
[2023-01-05 17:07:33] <%tarpor_> idk thats for nadeo to decide, maybe they can just lower an AT manually if they feel its over the top

[2023-01-05 17:07:57] <%+IamPd> @Uprush_ for full author skin to level 13 you need 109 of 115 possible ATs
[2023-01-05 17:08:02] <%+smgluten> What about that one map that involved 2 routes, the AT only possible on the one being a kacky route. Would that be allowed under this new judgement?
[2023-01-05 17:08:08] <%ShcrTM> i had in plans a tricky plastic map with an absurd AT targeted to be TOTD since april 2022, i guess it's a dead project now

Check out !medals to see the most difficult author medals in the campaign and my personal best on !midori - Before you ask, https://www.author-tracker.com uses a different medal for Midori compared to the ingame one. The goal is to just gather the available ones slow and steadily.

[2023-01-05 17:24:36] <@%JoranWitte> solution: nadeo should add a new medal to track of the days where it is themselves driving the track, factor those in for potential prestige shenanigans and leave author medals however people want them to be (as long as they are valid)

[2023-01-05 17:28:45] <%Spyder23_> birdie34Despair
[2023-01-05 17:28:47] <%+Juphee> it's 10 bucks
[2023-01-05 17:28:49] <%pidesquare> one thing for that to be a silent policy... on the other hands its a little YIKES to say it out loud.
[2023-01-05 17:28:50] <Hedgedogue> im gonna get gold then
[2023-01-05 17:28:50] <stoshag0vnazad> i cannot buy tm directly OMEGA
[2023-01-05 17:28:51] <Glocom> At that point you had the value of the free version
[2023-01-05 17:28:52] <%arppaax> I mean at that point get a job if you dont have couple extra bucks xpp
[2023-01-05 17:28:53] <%ThatRei> he phrased it really badly, that's for sure
[2023-01-05 17:28:57] <Hedgedogue> fuc em
[2023-01-05 17:28:57] <meamorui> @MASSA make games F2P
[2023-01-05 17:28:59] <%tarpor_> you just make a new account and smurf the shit out of bronze ok
[2023-01-05 17:28:59] <%Kriidy> I mean, how many people with starter get to gold, lets be honest
[2023-01-05 17:29:01] <%jethrobaggins> if only there were more players mabye the could pick cmpign or WT maps
[2023-01-05 17:29:04] <@%Eyohna> what if you are 14 and you can't afford the game
[2023-01-05 17:29:05] <SheepPog> WAYTOODANK
[2023-01-05 17:29:08] <+RikuXan> it's understandable but still feels bad for competitive integrity
[2023-01-05 17:29:10] <ViggyNash> If its in matchmaking, you should be able to practice the map...
[2023-01-05 17:29:14] <VVSpinBounce> He has a point, but it's such a stupid one xdd
[2023-01-05 17:29:15] <@%MASSA> bro
[2023-01-05 17:29:16] <%NotEnoughSpeed> @meamorui this game has no in-game transactions, it can't hold itself F2P
[2023-01-05 17:29:18] <@%MASSA> if costs 10 euro
[2023-01-05 17:29:19] <%pidesquare> @Eyohna then get rekt scrub
[2023-01-05 17:29:19] <cha0t> raid question: how do you farm to level 25? i'm 22 but cannot progress in the campaigne with my team, do i just spam old campaign maps?
[2023-01-05 17:29:19] <ReubanoCubano> it's 10 bucks a year like if you can afford a PC that can play this game well enough to reach high ranks, you can afford 10 beans a year
[2023-01-05 17:29:21] <%pepperoneh> then they should cap rank to silver for starters
[2023-01-05 17:29:23] <@%MASSA> and if u cant afford it, play fortnite

[2023-01-05 17:29:28] <%Tylionshield> if matchmaking is free and the maps show up in matchmaking, then the maps themselves should be free as well
[2023-01-05 17:29:28] <%alexS_> i had 10 euros with 14 eyohna
[2023-01-05 17:29:29] <ViggyNash> I get that its a money thing to make sure people buy standard
[2023-01-05 17:29:29] <whensacrix275> typical pay 2 win game
[2023-01-05 17:29:31] <%tarpor_> this whole thing could be fixed with 2 different queues ok

[2023-01-05 17:29:37] <meamorui> @MASSA this is does not work like this
[2023-01-05 17:29:37] <%OnlyFireball> i have to agree with mosso
[2023-01-05 17:29:38] <%KamielMonteur> I dont see how someone with starter access can make his way to the TM discord and wants to play TMWT maps
[2023-01-05 17:29:42] <@%MASSA> why, theres so much free.... its a business move
[2023-01-05 17:29:43] <@%MASSA> all gucci
[2023-01-05 17:29:44] <n4zgul3001> maybe if you put the hours to get good as gold, you have had enough fun to spend 10 bucks per year.
[2023-01-05 17:29:45] <%Schmaniol> its either a meal at mcdonalds/burgerking or tm2020 standard access
[2023-01-05 17:29:46] <%Schmaniol> choose wisely
[2023-01-05 17:29:48] <grassvy> tbf standard is pretty fairly priced
[2023-01-05 17:29:52] <hachikuku> @reubanocubano very privileged take
[2023-01-05 17:29:56] <Magpie_AI> i like mcdonalds
[2023-01-05 17:29:56] <CoolReal> I finished COD battlepass and haven't bought it, no money
[2023-01-05 17:29:58] <%NotEnoughSpeed> TM has no other way to monetize tho, fortnite is selling dances and skins
[2023-01-05 17:29:58] <@%Eyohna> I know it's only 10€ but when I was 14 my parents would never buy me something online KEKL
[2023-01-05 17:29:59] <%Silver_star12> But then you can't afford any game above 50 euros then, like never
[2023-01-05 17:29:59] <hachikuku> im gona eat 2 burger

[2023-01-05 17:30:05] <misiekf71> you can play any map with starter access if you open it through hot-seat, it's not even an exploit, intended from the start
[2023-01-05 17:30:05] <%pidesquare> muh mickeyDs
[2023-01-05 17:30:05] <yxhuvud> I wonder how many players it affect though
[2023-01-05 17:30:05] <%arppaax> just put the maps behind paywall xpp 1€ / map
[2023-01-05 17:30:11] <@%MASSA> well i think its stupid that u can play mm without prac
[2023-01-05 17:30:11] <%FullOfTryxz> it's strange that some part of matchmaking is free and some of it is not
[2023-01-05 17:30:11] <%+PizzleGG> so is it gold matchmaking now or masters?
[2023-01-05 17:30:13] <grassvy> @arppaax xdd
[2023-01-05 17:30:14] <+WonarioStrike> what if Matchmaking was not in the free access in the first place?
[2023-01-05 17:30:16] <JJAndrew_> Shouldnt be expected to pay to practice maps that are included in a free part of the game
[2023-01-05 17:30:17] <Buuuuurd> long chicken menu > standard access
[2023-01-05 17:30:17] <%+PizzleGG> for the E maps
[2023-01-05 17:30:18] <%7x9x0> mm = demo. if you like it you gotta pay. i kinda agree
[2023-01-05 17:30:19] <%alexS_> gold @PizzleGG
[2023-01-05 17:30:21] <@%MASSA> gold should be locked fully behind paywall or everything free
[2023-01-05 17:30:21] <%matmarex> hear me out, car hats
[2023-01-05 17:30:21] <+shakydoehl> you play so much, that you get gold...a movie in cinema costs more, cmon
[2023-01-05 17:30:21] <%Spyder23_> @pizzlegg gold
[2023-01-05 17:30:23] <Zaco_> YEP imagine if you're 14 years old and are good at TM
[2023-01-05 17:30:24] <%luiarag> It should be an unlock once you reach gold
[2023-01-05 17:30:25] <%+mk7mcgee> Like it’s only $30. We’ve all spent money on worse shit lolol
[2023-01-05 17:30:25] <%Permzilla> instead of pay to play it's pay to practice
[2023-01-05 17:30:25] <%+IamPd> @PizzleGG changed to gold
[2023-01-05 17:30:25] <%+PizzleGG> thank god
[2023-01-05 17:30:28] <%+cornucopia_99> Agreed spam
[2023-01-05 17:30:32] <%NotEnoughSpeed> is mm free content, or is it to test the game?

[2023-01-05 17:30:41] <@%MASSA> OR!!!!!!!!!!!
[2023-01-05 17:30:44] <%Kriidy> @MASSA didn't you say that in another thread it was saud that definitely something to consider
[2023-01-05 17:30:45] <yxhuvud> gold paywall seems worse.
[2023-01-05 17:30:46] <%allfightstar> gz you unlocked payment Pag
[2023-01-05 17:30:47] <+RikuXan> if anything MM should be completely locked

[2023-01-05 17:31:03] <DacuberTM> naa you can get gold, you just can't level up anymore
[2023-01-05 17:31:04] <%+IamPd> they wanted to make MM only free in bronze at one point
[2023-01-05 17:31:04] <%pepperoneh> you can be capped at silver and gigasmurf everyone
[2023-01-05 17:31:10] <meamorui> @MASSA there so many dead games that did it MASSA, so many... games that you play are fully F2P
[2023-01-05 17:31:10] <Magpie_AI> cant F2P accounts just get locked at silver 3
[2023-01-05 17:31:10] <whensacrix275> this game went downhill since this p2w dings started xdd
[2023-01-05 17:31:10] <%Cifer524> it should be like the twitter blue thing, monthly sub for bein able to stay with a golden sign

[2023-01-05 17:31:45] <%NotEnoughSpeed> if you reach gold you got like 300+ hours in the game I bet
