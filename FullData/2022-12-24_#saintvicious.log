[2022-12-24 21:35:20] <+nandozimmer> i feel like the ad route are so much harder to stabilize then the ap route
[2022-12-24 21:35:34] VIEWERS: 638
[2022-12-24 21:37:21] <+nandozimmer> yeah but like the ap builds have alot of medium transition units that you can play, since poppy + rell or maybe riven/vi/rell/annie/allistar, there's alot more units that can help stabilize the mid game and save some hp. For AD i feel like theres only the bruiser route or only nilah, idk

[2022-12-24 23:40:09] <%+jaws98765> is rfc a slammable jax item? or do you only want it when people run the evasion augment?

[2022-12-24 23:48:00] <%+juskasin> does birthday present work at level 10?
[2022-12-24 23:48:09] <%+coolz85> oh right, cuz you get a 2 star level 5 at 9
