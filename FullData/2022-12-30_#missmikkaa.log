[2022-12-30 15:44:46] <skweefus> @CasualEmma yeah thats the case with many dogs unfortunately :(

[2022-12-30 15:45:35] <fabe_sd> thats what they think about children too :)
[2022-12-30 15:45:35] <%+ihavenoidea567> the pooping part would seem the worst. if one doesnt want to
[2022-12-30 15:45:37] <%theghostbaby> two dogs? poor kabeh might have to move out Sadge
[2022-12-30 15:45:37] <skweefus> just train one to feed the other. big brain
[2022-12-30 15:45:43] <!%+bmap72> exactly
[2022-12-30 15:45:43] <%cropperTV> i get 2 cats but it would be double poop scoop duty hercul7Cry
[2022-12-30 15:45:46] <%Bmoney159> If you get a puppy tho, that will be challenging
[2022-12-30 15:45:48] <+ODREN13> think like a child
[2022-12-30 15:45:49] <oskerdegrump> depends on the dogs personality
[2022-12-30 15:45:49] <kane_ong> train 2 dogs to take care of each other Kappa
[2022-12-30 15:45:51] <+ODREN13> 😄
[2022-12-30 15:45:52] <Diakunn> Have two black labs, literally feels no different to having the one
[2022-12-30 15:45:59] <%ChibaJP> I have a main coon cat
[2022-12-30 15:46:05] <%zylowolf8> 2 dogs are great
[2022-12-30 15:46:07] <%Daeriius> I have three plus rotating fosters.  Its not hard if it's a labor of love mikkaaBlush
[2022-12-30 15:46:09] <%+voried> Hello Mika and chat! Hows ur days been so far?
[2022-12-30 15:46:13] <%cropperTV> @ChibaJP ooh a friend in norway has one, they're amazing
[2022-12-30 15:46:17] <@%$CasualEmma> Both mine have totally different personalities from eachother so it's definitely different. Both rescue dogs too!
[2022-12-30 15:46:19] <%ChibaJP> I wanted a shiba but not dog person
[2022-12-30 15:46:22] <%brianthebroken85> Ooh, can a Shiba be trained to like, use the toilet or something?
[2022-12-30 15:46:29] <%+rmestarii> get a golden an it feels like not having a dog at all
[2022-12-30 15:46:29] <%FernoFry> 2 dogs is harder, I just spent Christmas with some. They get jealous of each other
[2022-12-30 15:46:32] <GibbonLrt> Is playing two Elden ring games only a bit harder than one game?

[2022-12-30 15:46:46] <!%+bmap72> hahha
[2022-12-30 15:46:48] <%spittingglass> Puppies are definitely more challenging, they're made of nothing but needle teeth and poop
[2022-12-30 15:46:49] <%Gypsylights> Yoshi could be role model
[2022-12-30 15:46:52] <TheSgtYoshi> not playing elden ring for 1 hour
[2022-12-30 15:46:56] <yunolool> imagine walking into the bathroom seeing a shiba taking a dump

[2022-12-30 15:58:50] <%brianthebroken85> I do get the part about Ranni being a doll because her real body died when she...wait...I forgot already...haha. something about the rune of death and separating herself from the goldern order...
[2022-12-30 15:58:59] <%+voried> @Dru2037 all is good man, hope all is well with you too!
[2022-12-30 15:58:59] <%+InsightfulRhino> i recommend not going the wrong way
[2022-12-30 15:59:01] <@%Yruhatin> no, you had that problem with the A5100 when you first plugged it in if you remember. the FPS were really low, until you moved it to the front of the case which uses another internal USB controller on your motherboard
[2022-12-30 15:59:17] <%+H_Fuller> I've never played Elden Ring, nto a big Souls fan... but this has actually made it look fun.

[2022-12-30 18:11:00] <%+Ender1321> dont you have to summon her at the end of her quest though? Latenna I mean
[2022-12-30 18:11:06] <%Lithium__F> didnt know that, so cool
[2022-12-30 18:11:09] <%Snake__0> damn good to know
[2022-12-30 18:11:10] <IanMidknight> or use a charm branch
[2022-12-30 18:11:29] <%+insanesamly> Yeah what she said haha
[2022-12-30 18:11:36] <%+Ender1321> it is through the dialogue I guess
[2022-12-30 18:11:46] <%+insanesamly> never actually need the summons
[2022-12-30 18:11:55] <%brianthebroken85> yeah, when you get to where you need to take Latenna, you just have to interact with something I think. No need to fight anyone with her.
[2022-12-30 18:11:58] <%+Ender1321> that's good to know actually thanks!

[2022-12-30 18:12:40] <%+Ender1321> she always dies in my play throughs before I get there so I have never actually done her quest

[2022-12-30 18:46:03] <%h_filmbert> Not even for a second hehe.
[2022-12-30 18:46:04] <%arcus_brutalis> I never thought ypu cheatet
[2022-12-30 18:46:05] <FloraMerigold> Never thought that
[2022-12-30 18:46:05] <%venturific> not at all
[2022-12-30 18:46:06] <VagabondJC> i dunno im a pre recorded bot with predetermined responses
[2022-12-30 18:46:06] <choopa__> i was suspicious at first ngl
[2022-12-30 18:46:07] <cornnuts> looks legit to me
[2022-12-30 18:46:07] <papatreo> never ever
[2022-12-30 18:46:07] <+Peteman1000> I don't think you are, but this game has such a reputation for being really punishing
[2022-12-30 18:46:08] <%+de_gree_> i still think that :)
[2022-12-30 18:46:08] <%h0tperse> nah. nothing fake to begin with
[2022-12-30 18:46:09] <%michael_r_hassler> None
[2022-12-30 18:46:10] <%Snake__0> I think that happens to all women streamers unfortunately
[2022-12-30 18:46:12] <%dennisthemenace_1> You can see that that is not true,,,
[2022-12-30 18:46:12] <+Dr_OmegaX> i’m watching closely i can tell ur not cheating
[2022-12-30 18:46:13] <%+voried> i didnt think that, i was just genuinely intrigued
[2022-12-30 18:46:13] <@%Yruhatin> I still believe that
[2022-12-30 18:46:13] <%leetnanas> Never once. Thats probably just misogynists
[2022-12-30 18:46:14] <+icantbel1eve1t> Anything that looks sufficiently difficult will always attract people who can't believe it's possible. You're just awesome.
[2022-12-30 18:46:14] <christofferjen02> never
[2022-12-30 18:46:15] <azullikeblue> just found this stream like 5 min ago, I never thoughts otherwise
[2022-12-30 18:46:16] VIEWERS: 3 613
[2022-12-30 18:46:17] <Ulrahgol> Never tought it was fake, what'd be the point otherwise
[2022-12-30 18:46:17] <%vic__boss> I know it's Yoshi playing this whole time Kappa
[2022-12-30 18:46:18] <xT4SK> always looks legit to me
[2022-12-30 18:46:19] <FloraMerigold> You're just hella good at these games (and multitasking apparently)
[2022-12-30 18:46:19] <+Sheikah_Slacker> I thought it was ridiculous but like difficulty and not in terms of cheating lol
[2022-12-30 18:46:20] <nemerfadez> im actually person playing both games and this is replay from 2015
[2022-12-30 18:46:21] <%arodSG> nah, I thought you were just good
[2022-12-30 18:46:21] <%n_o_r_e_n_> never thought that
[2022-12-30 18:46:22] <+GameLegenddd> when i first came in i did not think that LUL
[2022-12-30 18:46:22] <+iced_coffee420> everyone can see youre the GOAT theyre just jealous
[2022-12-30 18:46:22] <%RandomRed38> ev0raNo
[2022-12-30 18:46:22] <+simplekom> in fact Mika is a full cg model
[2022-12-30 18:46:25] <%+HeSellSeaShells> i found your channel through Jake Lucky tweeting about you, so i figured you were legit if he was advertising you
[2022-12-30 18:46:25] <@%xblom> @Yruhatin lol
[2022-12-30 18:46:26] <%jonkiwi_lurk> i didnot wath what you have post but i wath you playfor me it legit!
[2022-12-30 18:46:27] <pow_cs> you are a honest person, even with your webcam off, i would believe you
[2022-12-30 18:46:29] <PizzaFaceNerd> I didn’t necessarily think that, but I still can’t rap my head around it being real @missmikkaa
[2022-12-30 18:46:30] <%+Doctor3_> it would be more diffictult to sync up movements, to a prerecorded video, than it would be to just learn this. people just need to naysay everything
[2022-12-30 18:46:31] <%michael_r_hassler> Too legit to quit
[2022-12-30 18:46:32] <+GameLegenddd> but now it reeks of a conspiracy theory Kappa
[2022-12-30 18:46:33] <gamminnnng> i dident know what a dance pad was
[2022-12-30 18:46:33] <%sealeyourface> LUL how could you watch and think it's fake. It's very obvious you are constantly moving your gaze from screen to screen
[2022-12-30 18:46:33] <%Gen_C_R6> yea... yoshi is actually playing the other one mikkaaKEKW mikkaaKEKW
[2022-12-30 18:46:34] <+Mazerin_Firenze> I assume it's genuine until proven otherwise.  But I'm a generally trusting person
[2022-12-30 18:46:42] <%wakuzanym> It looked suspicious until I saw you struggling with gravity. Repeatedly.
[2022-12-30 18:46:44] <%+RubunASandwich> Never thought suspicious. You can't convince everyone though its just human psychology
[2022-12-30 18:46:44] <xTIGERxls> dont be like that u r doin fine dont care what their thinking
[2022-12-30 18:46:44] <SultanSaidi> i just thought from the beginning that you are insane in trying this and insanly good in actually achieving this
[2022-12-30 18:46:45] <%hortasio> if someone can do it with a banana why not like this? lbwHaha
[2022-12-30 18:46:45] <+s41nttr1n4> they just can't stand to see a woman shine sophie28Scream sophie28Scream
[2022-12-30 18:46:46] <%Snake__0> it just wouldn't be worth it to fake it, dont know why anyone would fake it
[2022-12-30 18:46:47] <Mystery121o1> your movements on the dance pad lines up with gameplay so didnt doubt it much
[2022-12-30 18:46:47] <JRScribe> maybe I know enough about gaming have never been suspicious about this it's like an intuition
[2022-12-30 18:46:48] <%+Totald78> the whole world is mikkaaSus
[2022-12-30 18:46:50] <kurosagi59> I think that you're not cheating :) Just think that you are talented :)
[2022-12-30 18:46:54] <Epinephilim> Very odd instinct. Self-imposed challenges have always been a thing, so I don't see why not to believe you when you do one.
[2022-12-30 18:46:56] <+metaljesus1987> Just put a camera on your controller
[2022-12-30 18:46:57] <Luckspider> Its just so damn impressive
[2022-12-30 18:46:57] <Err0rrek> Maybe its kind of cheating, cause women are better at multitasking
[2022-12-30 18:46:58] <%vic__boss> I never had a reason to doubt you or to think you were cheating
[2022-12-30 18:47:00] <+ekazhiel> Jealousy ? For them it is impossible in their mind I guess
[2022-12-30 18:47:03] <grimnasherr> they finally relaize your greatness
[2022-12-30 18:47:05] <+Zelda_Boy_> I only caught myself saying game is either that easy or she's that good
[2022-12-30 18:47:08] <%sydewinder007> the thought nevber crossed my mind. I did however doubt you would be able to do as well as you have. Note to self "never underestimate MIkkaa"
[2022-12-30 18:47:10] <%justjeeto> how dare are they say mikkaa cheating ?
[2022-12-30 18:47:11] <Ulrahgol> I suppose people are getting to know amazing challenge runs are kinda your thing
[2022-12-30 18:47:12] <%ZelioGames> Never crossed my mind. It could have also been easily debunked by Tracing your dance pad steps with the actions in game
[2022-12-30 18:47:13] <wilky37> miika reading chat + playing on 2 screens at once rn
[2022-12-30 18:47:15] <%+runningwolf27> I've watched a lot of streamers do challenge runs, so this isn't much that's new to me, pretty damn cool though
[2022-12-30 18:47:15] <%michael_r_hassler> @ekazhiel Yep
[2022-12-30 18:47:15] <%ArvaNode> meeks is running on spoon power
[2022-12-30 18:47:17] <%justjeeto> clearly they are not watching live
[2022-12-30 18:47:19] <kurosagi59> Not everyone can do what you do now
[2022-12-30 18:47:20] <%savanntt> looked sus untill gideon fight
[2022-12-30 18:47:22] <SaiPhani100> Nah. I personally just admire your skill at the game.
[2022-12-30 18:47:23] <+BoomerGamer> People know how hard it is on controller, so you have more credibility here I suppose b/c if the controller is real so is the dance pad. Never doubted that it was real, just in AWE
[2022-12-30 18:47:24] <tommytomtoes> There will always be haters on social media, unfortunately.
[2022-12-30 18:47:28] <firstname_surname> Given your other runs, this just seemed like the next logical step up in dificulty...
[2022-12-30 18:47:28] <JRScribe> gaming knowledge plus mikkaa personality knowledge hehe. she's a fairly honest person
[2022-12-30 18:47:29] <+aldeuur> howw??
[2022-12-30 18:47:30] <CaStike> i still don't understand how you do this
[2022-12-30 18:47:31] <Epinephilim> I guess maybe it's because meme runs and challenges have been such a huge part of Elden Ring?
[2022-12-30 18:47:40] <%+Totald78> everyone knows by now that Yoshi is off screen playing both for you mikkaaKEKW
[2022-12-30 18:47:41] <ErinyaBucky> I saw a clip from asmongold and i though HOLY she has a huge brain to be able to do that and also not get distracted. But didnt doubt for a second
[2022-12-30 18:47:42] <EllJustin> Elden Ring needs some DLC, I'm itching to play now
[2022-12-30 18:47:44] <%jonkiwi_lurk> she is very talented and  like to do hard challenge for the few time i come
[2022-12-30 18:47:49] <rik2205> @CaStike simple she doesnt
[2022-12-30 18:47:50] <%jonkiwi_lurk> you are *very
[2022-12-30 18:47:53] <+aldeuur> she got 2 brain or what ?
[2022-12-30 18:47:57] <cornnuts> idk how tf youre gonna do Malenia... i struggled on her playing normally lmao

[2022-12-30 18:48:12] <!%bmap72> yeah maybe I'm just to trusting but when I found the stream during the dance pad run, I thought it was awesome and didn't doubt it for a second haha
[2022-12-30 18:48:13] <xTIGERxls> @CaStike su she does
[2022-12-30 18:48:13] <Sivicks> solid try tho
[2022-12-30 18:48:13] <%+s_ebecrep> maybe it is just too crazy to think you cheat, i arrived here and was just amazed that this could be done
[2022-12-30 18:48:13] <DLeon_Art> I mean, after watching the 1 hand and the dance pad runs I guess it would "make sense" in a way XD
[2022-12-30 18:48:13] <%queeran> lolll yes anyone who saw you walk up to loretta would believe believe that this is legit

[2022-12-30 18:49:18] <%h0tperse> I thought that its gonna be a struggle fulltime but you proved that we humans can adapt and overcome
[2022-12-30 18:49:19] <%+s_ebecrep> in fact, dancepad being recorded and you having to comment it could be harder
[2022-12-30 18:49:22] <%Gypsylights> now your too cold?
[2022-12-30 18:49:22] <%Nochtiz_wh> i thought that this was awesome and i needed to watch this challenge
[2022-12-30 18:49:23] <%dennisthemenace_1> if you were cheating, you would be killing bosses on fewer attempts
[2022-12-30 18:49:27] <%+Totald78> what's a human brain? LUL
[2022-12-30 18:49:27] <%michael_r_hassler> @epinephilim My challenge is not to look away

[2022-12-30 18:53:33] <%+Ender1321> The souls community is also very picky and judgemental. just look at how they respond to people using magic and playing in ways they dont seem acceptable. Your dance pads runs flaunt all that so it upsets them. maybe that's it? just my opinion
[2022-12-30 18:53:41] <mybatterywas86whenijoined> how is this possible?!

[2022-12-30 18:53:51] <zalmoxis404> It was hard to belive when aI heard you wanna finish the game on the pad, now that you finish both at the same time is litteraly insanity .. or sparta, idk
