[2023-01-08 12:13:48] <!HawoooBakeinu> You need the personnel anyway right? But if you save up the money for the steam cores you can hire more workers who'll go on strike

[2023-01-08 12:14:38] <!HawoooBakeinu> My brother played Ixion just a few days ago LUL
[2023-01-08 12:14:46] <+Uwianger> Hi
[2023-01-08 12:14:47] <madmaxc44> im playing it now
[2023-01-08 12:14:51] <$sircool099> i've heard that ixion is disappointing
[2023-01-08 12:14:53] <!HawoooBakeinu> Seems Ixion is way easier than Frostpunk or so
[2023-01-08 12:15:15] <madmaxc44> its fairly slow
[2023-01-08 12:15:15] <$sircool099> that you HAVE to play it in certain ways and only certain ways, else you just lose
[2023-01-08 12:15:20] <!HawoooBakeinu> Though from what I know the game seems to have only 1 scenario and 2 endings?
[2023-01-08 12:16:21] <$sircool099> Riftbreaker is something i'd suggest myself. it's like factorio but more action-y and won't destroy your brain trying to understand it
[2023-01-08 12:16:26] <!HawoooBakeinu> Imagine just hiring 2x as many ppl and working 24/7 LUL
[2023-01-08 12:16:28] <madmaxc44> you always need at least food and alloys, but if you don't use your stuff you can slowly blead Resorces

[2023-01-08 15:35:35] <Synesh> My dwarf fortress is under a deluge of migrants and I have no job for them. So frustating, I had a job for everyone and now it's a micro-managing headache
[2023-01-08 15:35:38] <!HawoooBakeinu> Always good to have spare parts no?
[2023-01-08 15:36:32] <!Skarbimir> yes-yes?

[2023-01-08 15:37:15] <!HawoooBakeinu> Ceri certainly took a liking to building the security measures as well :)
[2023-01-08 15:37:55] <!HawoooBakeinu> And it reduces progress loss/prevents deaths, no?
[2023-01-08 15:38:03] <!HawoooBakeinu> Perfect timing
