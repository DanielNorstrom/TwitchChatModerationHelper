[2022-12-07 13:23:36] <+QaptainGeebs> was trial of elements nerfed? I just did it and couldnt see the event and couldnt open the chest
[2022-12-07 13:23:38] <+RezCnt> anyone know what his rare weakaura is called?
[2022-12-07 13:23:48] <+xallar> Are there any other weekly quests like "dragon eyes" that give high ilevel rewards. this one is giving me 385 atm

[2022-12-07 16:14:05] <masch1ne13> @dracboomiekek i read that. But most Players prefer "better" Class over better Player. So if you dont play a meta class you get a hard time sometimes in wotlk
