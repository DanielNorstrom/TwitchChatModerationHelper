[2023-01-05 07:39:34] <+pocket_colloseus> there are differences in the bodies response between a walk and an ice bath, but they have a similar enough impact for general population that ethier works well. I'm an exercise physiologist and this is an area I used to work with
[2023-01-05 07:40:00] <Omatche> Walking doesn’t activate your vagus nerve.

[2023-01-05 08:08:32] <%LiamG> It can’t add anything to the audio, only change what’s there by post processing

[2023-01-05 08:08:52] <%BanthaFodder> Atmos or DTSx works. Yeah, Sequisha figured the sound engineers working on the new audio probably had it active, so some sounds are playing on audio channels that a standard headset would miss. @BreaK
[2023-01-05 08:08:52] <%Line_Noise> DTS is licensed so it’s an add on  yeah

[2023-01-05 08:10:22] <%LiamG> Proper spatial audio requires a source encoded for it. Tarkov isn’t, so it’s all just a postfx trying to fake it. Like a stereo upmix
[2023-01-05 08:10:30] <%BartjuhOnFire> Im thinking of just not doing any quests
[2023-01-05 08:10:37] <Gerdoran> are the task different eacxh season? or is it more or less the same?
[2023-01-05 08:10:40] <%LiamG> Good if it works for you, but no way is it universally better
[2023-01-05 08:10:48] <%LiamG> And yeh, zero chance of that
[2023-01-05 08:10:55] <%+dootplays> Im not sure it works any better for me

[2023-01-05 08:11:02] <%BanthaFodder> I was trained in broadcasting audio and have had Atmos for that reason. I need my ear sex.
[2023-01-05 08:11:02] <%BartjuhOnFire> @gerdoran  its the same.  Just some very minor changes
[2023-01-05 08:11:13] <%Line_Noise> The DTS stuff I believe fundamentally alters Windows’ sound mix

[2023-01-05 08:11:34] <%BanthaFodder> @BreaK not really, an audio engineer would be using the best tools available.
[2023-01-05 08:11:39] <dnfraceing> SeemsGood
[2023-01-05 08:11:57] <%BanthaFodder> I would.
[2023-01-05 08:12:03] <%LiamG> @line_noise well, it does. Just like activating stereo upmix
[2023-01-05 08:12:03] <%BartjuhOnFire> @mykl3  I do
[2023-01-05 08:12:05] <shortymen1982> Atmos I also use it and am happy with it

[2023-01-05 08:12:17] <%LiamG> You build for what your users have
[2023-01-05 08:12:20] <%Line_Noise> The real thing is that the audio engineer and whoever did the audio engine in the actual code should have had this talk
[2023-01-05 08:12:29] <%LiamG> @jasoneight that is exactly what they’re using…
[2023-01-05 08:12:29] <Gerdoran> @BartjuhOnFire yea sounds like it. i dont play the game myself but questing is kinda essential isnt it?

[2023-01-05 08:13:48] <%BanthaFodder> I always have Atmos running, I wouldn't have thought to turn it off unless specified to. Audio engineers are a strange lot.

[2023-01-05 08:14:09] <%LiamG> You can basically watch Reddit and know what chat is gunna be full of the next day based on what’s random guy has said the day before
[2023-01-05 08:14:34] <%+wanderergod> all I know is that yesterday was the first time in EFT that I actually knew where shots were coming from ingame. and I was using DTS.
[2023-01-05 08:14:51] <%SingularFish> DTS hayzKEK
[2023-01-05 08:14:52] <%BartjuhOnFire> @mykl3  ahhh.  Well we could do a raid later.   Im a bit washed tho
[2023-01-05 08:15:07] <%+wanderergod> but I am also absolute shit at EFT
[2023-01-05 08:15:09] <%BanthaFodder> @BreaK as I said; that's what Sequisha was saying, and as a trained audio engineer, it made sense to me. Beyond that tarky be tarky.

[2023-01-05 10:25:26] <%noize> its like 10 times more efficient than putting the oven on and takes half the time. no brainer
[2023-01-05 10:25:29] <%Ed_1878> Yeah i have one that looks like a mini oven. I can fit a large chicken and veg in it
[2023-01-05 10:25:32] <%BartjuhOnFire> I will never air try a steak.   But chips, or chicken wings are great
[2023-01-05 10:25:38] <+phangz_dpg> much healthier it drips away fats and grease
[2023-01-05 10:25:43] <yawn334> I won one, haven't used yet, you're inspiring me haha
[2023-01-05 10:25:50] <%fredboi1> I think the air fryer is great but i still prefer deep fried chips Kreygasm
[2023-01-05 10:25:52] <%Line_Noise> Healthier than deep frying

[2023-01-05 10:25:58] <%Line_Noise> But you eat more chips
[2023-01-05 10:26:00] <+adentos> healthier, faster, easier to get a good cook
[2023-01-05 10:26:00] <%kriissshh> healthier than frying stuff in a pan
[2023-01-05 10:26:02] <%+Rummage79> Can roast a whole frozen chicken in 40 mins

[2023-01-05 10:27:38] <%svekky> kleier the amount of power it consumes makes me question if it’s cheaper than a conventional oven though
[2023-01-05 10:27:49] <%kleier> Lemings for some people yes, but i don't think shaving 20 minutes off cooking time a game changer when you have to spend that long cleaning the bastard KEKW

[2023-01-05 12:06:25] <%LiamG> i think you have to have a profile setup
[2023-01-05 12:06:28] <@%GreggStrat> I thought it usually meant too many scavs queuing for raids
[2023-01-05 12:06:30] <Runarh> Legendary drop inc.
[2023-01-05 12:06:30] <%Jo0LzTV> There are, but you take two slots of scav, if you solo queue it you'll be in a lot faster

[2023-01-05 12:06:38] <+wee_l_p> I think it means there is too may scavs qing so it struggles to find a serve for you, cus if u q reserve on pmc u get it
[2023-01-05 12:06:38] <%+teep17> think it was too many scavs
[2023-01-05 12:06:43] <%ZCrimes> 100+ left
[2023-01-05 12:06:43] <%SM0GGI> there's nobody playing reserve so no raids to scav into

[2023-01-05 12:07:50] <Kumakx> long? you could complete game with killing only 11 bosses. glitchless But thats requires knowledge of what to do and where to go

[2023-01-05 12:09:51] <Kumakx> 18k could make diference, if they were all from same region, elsewise not really
[2023-01-05 12:09:52] <@%sRede> all big tech is doing it
[2023-01-05 12:09:52] <%ZENDRY> they always lay off after christmas

[2023-01-05 12:09:55] <%+wanderergod> all in the Alexa/Fire division... it was too bloated.
[2023-01-05 12:09:59] <%Darkmascott> Most of the job losses will come from its consumer retail business and its human resources division
[2023-01-05 12:10:01] <%PR3TENDr> small indie company
[2023-01-05 12:10:07] <%JonnyTBH> they just use robots now
[2023-01-05 12:10:07] <@%GreggStrat> @ZCrimes Indeed. In all fairness he didnt really explore it much. He sorta just went straight to the boss and left.

[2023-01-05 12:10:23] <+admiralantares> probably extra staff employed for a short period
[2023-01-05 12:10:24] <%LiamG> they just officially published the number yesterday because it was leaked

[2023-01-05 12:58:16] <%JonnyTBH> its "broken" in the sense it uses a lot more cpu so can reduce performance for some
[2023-01-05 12:58:29] <ska_to_go> Its not binural - the hole soundengine isnt working as intended
[2023-01-05 12:58:33] <%fredboi1> Guy outside
[2023-01-05 12:58:36] <addoK> Is that DTS activated on Dolby Access?

[2023-01-05 12:58:42] <%Line_Noise> Binaural has been fine for me since the start as far as errors or crashes
[2023-01-05 12:58:47] <%LiamG> @GriffZero it's worth trying, just appreciate it's 100% subjective and hardware dependant, so see if it sounds better for you. Just don't think it's adding anything to the audio at all, all it can do it modify what's output by the game, not create anything new

[2023-01-05 13:53:50] <%+Under_the_C> @LurkerCM i think packages can be delayed due to "busy airspace" so it may well drop late, but i remember being told that if you trigger it with less than 8 minutes or something it wont work

[2023-01-05 14:56:35] <%piiioneer> dlss sucks
[2023-01-05 14:56:43] <%kleier> fair dos, ignore me then FrogeNeat
[2023-01-05 14:56:44] <@%OutbreakBot> If you want to support me you can sub for free using Twitch Prime! See if yours is available below. brkGood
[2023-01-05 14:56:50] <+geonoxes> The idea is you get a slightly worse image, but a lot more FPS, but tarkovs implementation of DLSS is pretty bad
[2023-01-05 14:56:58] <MrCM> it can give visual artifacts and ghosting, but its remarkable how well it can upscale. as long as you dont use it on 1080p, it should be fine. For me its worth it for all the extra fps i gain
[2023-01-05 14:56:58] <%fofo8383> not doing bad for a boomer
[2023-01-05 14:57:31] <%+DirtyDangles111> What’s wrong with 1080p ?
[2023-01-05 14:57:32] <%LiamG> DLSS is a module for your game engine. You don't implement it yourself
[2023-01-05 14:57:36] <%thirty3baboons> Every time digital foundry cover upscaling they're zooming to 400% to show the difference - if you need to be that close, I don't care...
[2023-01-05 14:57:38] <@%sRede> it feels like most people don't even know what dlss does and how it works and we just get these urban legend placebo takes
[2023-01-05 14:57:38] <MrCM> but you are on a 1080p monitor, and turn on DLSS, it upscales from 720p or something.. THAT does not look good

[2023-01-05 14:57:57] <%LiamG> for once i agree with sRede

[2023-01-05 14:58:07] <+geonoxes> @LiamG The why is tarkov's DLSS total shite and for other games it feels fine?
[2023-01-05 14:58:27] <%kleier> just coz it's a module doesn't mean it doesn't need some implementation
[2023-01-05 14:58:32] <@%sRede> can't wait for the dlss 2.5 and 3.0 confusion KEKL
[2023-01-05 14:58:37] <%Lemings> geonoxes Because it's Tarkov YEP
[2023-01-05 14:58:42] <+cherryghost2013> I think DLSS + unity = shitshow
[2023-01-05 14:58:49] <MrCM> for me it was a massive FPS jump, so i cant really think of a reason to turn it off. i dont notice the blur honestly
[2023-01-05 14:58:49] <%+JediSnowman> unity engine possibly?
[2023-01-05 14:58:50] <%+alcarp> surely for tarkov where you still need a crystal clear image and every pixel even on the side of the screen for spotting players, Tarkov its not DLSS's best example
[2023-01-05 14:59:00] <%thirty3baboons> If you started on a ZX81 and tolerated that...everything these days is buttery smooth and high rez.
[2023-01-05 14:59:02] <phrj> DLSS + DLDSR isn't bad
[2023-01-05 14:59:06] <heisenbergsnake> Cause dlss is for GPU problems. Tarkov problem is CPU sided mostly
[2023-01-05 14:59:13] <%DeadlyDag> Surely noone enables DLSS with 1080p.

[2023-01-05 15:00:31] <%FDeppy> 1080p to 1440p means less fps tho, right? brkHmm
[2023-01-05 15:00:42] <@%sRede> dlss isn't fully plug and play for devs, needs some work and if they don't do it properly it won't look good

[2023-01-05 15:00:53] <MrCM> im just saying, a legit 30-40 FPS jump just by enabling DLSS, thats kidna bonkers
[2023-01-05 15:00:58] <+Beardedbob> for tarkov 1440p is the sweet spot but you need a good setup
[2023-01-05 15:01:05] <%CandiedMango> 1440p is wild compared to 1080p

[2023-01-05 15:15:56] <@%GreggStrat> Streamers should eat before they start streaming. Eating while streaming, unless you put other content on and take the camera off you, is extremely bad manners and disgusting. "Streaming is a real job!" It is.

[2023-01-05 15:32:58] <%DeadlyDag> @phrj As I said, it doesn't show the correct values. YOU might have the correct values, but the variables are high. CPU-Z always shows the correct ones. It also depends if you're running AMD or Intel.  Mine are default at 3200, so it shows 3200 in windows. They are however OCd to 4000, which is mirrored in both BIOS and CPU-Z.

[2023-01-05 16:03:01] <MrCM> damn, when even granddaddy pestily rants a little about the game, you know its getting too much
[2023-01-05 16:03:13] <%hastig> except santa
[2023-01-05 16:03:17] <%JonnyTBH> and if another scav has killed a scav/shot you, you can kill them and not lose rep
[2023-01-05 16:03:21] <%hastig> which i did yesterday

[2023-01-05 16:03:37] <%Royce55> Koba27 and, as a pmc you can positively influence scav karma too, with the car extracts. and I think the scav coop extracts too

[2023-01-05 16:04:12] <7rav7> @BreaK EFT is a game where low-key cheating is super super rewarding - not even wallhacks but basic radar cheats will make your experience just so so much easier. The incentive to cheat in EFT is higher than in any other game.
[2023-01-05 16:04:12] <%FDeppy> as a scav, you want to team up with other scavs. i've been killed twice by other scavs WTFF
[2023-01-05 16:04:32] <CokeFlakes> you can also trick player scavs that you are new and could they leg tap you with pistols or knife to test damage taken, after that you are free to kill them KEKW
[2023-01-05 16:04:32] <Runarh> i think most bad scavs at the start of wipe are new players that dont know

[2023-01-05 16:04:43] <+DrBadLlama> pre karma, scav runs killing everything used to be so fun

[2023-01-05 16:05:48] <7rav7> @BreaK yea exactly. The best comparison I'd make is with original Dota wh. in terms of how much of a difference cheating makes. Which is why EFT for me is a dead dead dead game

[2023-01-05 16:10:43] <7rav7> @BreaK PUBG has the best anti-cheat in existence - no joke. It's called ranked mode. Normal games are just so chill and fun. Too bad it's too late for that game.
[2023-01-05 16:10:55] <Rawsick> Your game looks like it’s running super good. This game is all cpu an ram extensive it’s ridiculous

[2023-01-05 17:23:00] <%BazHicks> mine is way cheaper than that version @Lansdell_
[2023-01-05 17:23:08] <%smokeygerald> do you wash your dishes before they go in the dishwasher?
