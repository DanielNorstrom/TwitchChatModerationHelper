[2022-12-30 01:24:40] <%+zHellaa> I can get in just takes me forever as scav

[2022-12-30 19:44:03] <justboyo> But if id have to guess its gonna perform similar to @willerz s pc since the rx6950xt is equivalent to a 3080ti and the new raptorlake i5 is better atleast gaming wise than the i9 12900k

[2022-12-30 20:17:21] <xwaifusquad> @coconutsunrise69 there's no other way but to play solo. You have to get used to 1v2 and 1v3 and you have to be willing to die and learn from your mistakes. Start of wipe is not best to get over gear fear and pvp fear.

[2022-12-30 21:41:30] <xwaifusquad> @pizzybo hopefully they bugged it out so that people couldn't extract down there, thus deterring campers, thus deterring people ratting D2 and going underground so often -- wouldn't be surprised if they did it on purpose lol
