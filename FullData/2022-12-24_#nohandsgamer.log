I can't use a keyboard and mouse without severe pain. Luckily, I discovered hands-free technology as a way to control my computer. I may have the slowest APM in the business. My disability doesn't hold me back in hearthstone, though it may create some amusing moments when I can't click fast enough."2020 update: !nohandsbetter

[2022-12-24 02:48:13] <@^Nightbot> Hands have been doing really well lately. Started doing using new pain management strategies in June of 2019 and have been doing really well. Pain was so bad in 2018 and early 2019 I thought I was going to have to quit hearthstone. I'm able to type again in moderation which is a huge quality of life increase. Before on the stream I could only communicate with voice to text. Hoping to keep improving. Not looking to play high apm video games anytime soon though.

[2022-12-24 02:55:49] <+piecell> They’re probably pretty comparable
[2022-12-24 02:55:51] <%akaricrow> just joined, did I miss anything
[2022-12-24 02:55:56] <+piecell> Like it doesn’t matter right now
[2022-12-24 02:56:01] <+CaptPanda> it's not great into bonebreaker but they take face damage at least
[2022-12-24 02:56:01] <+piecell> Both work
[2022-12-24 02:56:27] <heavendivee> I lost with this deck facing blood dk
[2022-12-24 02:56:33] <+piecell> It’s inifnitrly more pressure Vs Druid than slither is
[2022-12-24 02:56:37] <%starwarz1> doomsayer hasn't been good since rush became a keyword
[2022-12-24 02:56:39] <+piecell> Ups and downs to both
[2022-12-24 02:56:44] <sekkaTFT> make warrior work :)
[2022-12-24 02:56:59] <+piecell> Yeah this meta is kind of boring
[2022-12-24 02:57:06] <%akaricrow> if I ever get to the point of not finding fun decks, I play a diff game for a bit
[2022-12-24 02:57:11] <%+GuildChatter> now it's like 15+ damage from hand

[2022-12-24 02:58:16] <+fireflygrave> Frost Deathknight so thematic, but Blizz just walked into an obvious trap Jebaited
[2022-12-24 02:58:25] <+piecell> It’s just whatever now
[2022-12-24 02:58:27] <+Smeet2> This was the DK deck I was worried about pre-expansion, and now nerfs paved the way for it to exist.
[2022-12-24 02:58:28] <+HouseTM> and they nerf draka
[2022-12-24 02:58:36] <xxvladtepesxx> still dont get the hit on renathal, why not go for Bran, its too toxic for burn combos
[2022-12-24 02:58:39] <+piecell> When mage is good I’m kind’ve not happy beer
[2022-12-24 02:58:56] <thedesstroier> I think the other changes would have all been fine except renethal
[2022-12-24 02:59:07] <+AdlerXI> i hit legend today with my second account and ladder is %90 of aggro decks
[2022-12-24 02:59:09] <+DrewStar23> we always have thief rogue
[2022-12-24 02:59:18] <+piecell> Renathal change was cringe
[2022-12-24 02:59:30] <+piecell> Just rotate it
[2022-12-24 02:59:32] <+HouseTM> is there anything that we can ad to secret mage?

[2022-12-24 03:00:44] <+CaptPanda> I think you could pretty easily make a control warrior deck that just crushes frost DK and loses to everything else

[2022-12-24 03:04:29] <%+irrationalwife> Is mage decent against Frost DK? or is solid alibi not good enough stall

[2022-12-24 03:05:14] <%akaricrow> I mean, they shafted the casuals, which is the chunk of players, idk
[2022-12-24 03:05:24] <FarseerMicro> ads over did I miss anything?
[2022-12-24 03:05:30] <FarseerMicro> oh gg
[2022-12-24 03:05:34] <!%pocket_train> I really don't think this deck is strong

[2022-12-24 03:05:38] <+AdlerXI> Renathal was very ver good. They killed the unique decks with that nerf too
[2022-12-24 03:05:42] <1bigd11> I'm casual and don't like 40 hp decks
[2022-12-24 03:05:53] <+helix_sky> i wish blood DK was a bit stronger
[2022-12-24 03:06:05] <%BabyRage_HS> really surprised they didn't nerf thief rogue
[2022-12-24 03:06:06] <+helix_sky> I also like the idea of unholy
[2022-12-24 03:06:08] <%+irrationalwife> Pocket Train has spoken. His word is absolute
[2022-12-24 03:06:20] <+HouseTM> against it if your deck uses board, u need to kill it before 7
[2022-12-24 03:06:33] <!%pocket_train> I mean it's ok but think it's been good in a fresh meta but will get phased out
[2022-12-24 03:06:34] <priestgod222> if you like priest i have a svalna combo ive been trying to push past 2k very fun, owns frost rogue an pala
[2022-12-24 03:06:39] <+ChristyMacAndCheese> Why wasn’t Frost played more then before when the best decks had 30HP?
[2022-12-24 03:06:48] <bitbangboom> its strong but its not op
[2022-12-24 03:06:49] <+datfrogger> thief rogue is sick
[2022-12-24 03:06:50] <+datfrogger> imo
[2022-12-24 03:07:01] <+animeissinful> Casuals like renathal coz he's like reno, it's a design that shouldn't be good competitively but when it is it's toxic
[2022-12-24 03:07:01] <+AdlerXI> @NoHandsGamer Fire Rush Warrior Tier 0 right ?
[2022-12-24 03:07:05] <%akaricrow> wow that looks fun Kappa
[2022-12-24 03:07:05] <%+irrationalwife> what is agro mage?

[2022-12-24 03:08:02] <+AdlerXI> %90 of games finish before turn 7-8 yeah i want to play more
[2022-12-24 03:08:46] <+datfrogger> thats lethal
[2022-12-24 03:08:52] <bizjeet5> thassarian on 4 btw, the game makes it happen
[2022-12-24 03:08:54] <+AdlerXI> i wish they nerf all decks into Blood DK power
[2022-12-24 03:08:55] <!%pocket_train> renathal games never felt that complex to me
[2022-12-24 03:08:57] <+DrewStar23> i just hate every aggro deck being bad
[2022-12-24 03:09:12] <%+irrationalwife> The Gluggernaut ends it
[2022-12-24 03:09:24] <bizjeet5> @drewstar23 aggro mage is good
[2022-12-24 03:09:28] <%BabyRage_HS> aggro decks are brain dead
[2022-12-24 03:09:29] <bizjeet5> as are a few others

[2022-12-24 03:09:44] <+DrewStar23> with 40 life aggro was tier dumpster
[2022-12-24 03:09:51] <%+irrationalwife> @drewstar23 this is an agro deck and is the 4th highest win rate deck
[2022-12-24 03:09:55] <%BabyRage_HS> @Zaxlor of course :)
[2022-12-24 03:09:59] <%+GuildChatter> nvm.. guess he would have traded
[2022-12-24 03:10:01] <+animeissinful> This is just perception though, a longer game doesn't necessarily mean more/better decisions
[2022-12-24 03:10:04] <+DrewStar23> the other meta
[2022-12-24 03:10:08] <chromat1> I tried the new BKibler warrior control it was pretty sweet!  Lorthamar + Trechstalker XD
[2022-12-24 03:10:12] <+AdlerXI> Curse implock was tier dumpster to you @DrewStar23  ?
[2022-12-24 03:10:25] <BAJSNIGHTOUT> aggro decks are harder than control :)
[2022-12-24 03:10:30] <chromat1> i was farming frost DK
[2022-12-24 03:10:36] <+DrewStar23> imp lock wasen't good for only one or two weeks and got nerfed
[2022-12-24 03:10:46] <khuchten> @NHG, is this deck viable and consistent Kappa ?
[2022-12-24 03:11:01] <+outra_coisa> Beautiful beard
[2022-12-24 03:11:03] <%BabyRage_HS> Aggro is just cheap and tacky imo
[2022-12-24 03:11:18] <+AdlerXI> Aggro is easy to play guys sorry
[2022-12-24 03:11:21] <priestgod222> infinite value turn= infinte decisions = infinite tempo
[2022-12-24 03:11:21] <heavendivee> How frost dk even good?
[2022-12-24 03:11:29] <+AdlerXI> Combo decks are hard not aggro ones
[2022-12-24 03:11:30] <%rotemv3> It wasnt like that though, it came down to removing and who plays denat first wins
[2022-12-24 03:11:34] VIEWERS: 596
[2022-12-24 03:11:35] <bizjeet5> burn damage
[2022-12-24 03:11:36] <%rotemv3> And theo ofc
[2022-12-24 03:11:37] <+animeissinful> 40 card hunter was the best deck in the game not a couple months ago and it's tempo based
[2022-12-24 03:11:38] <%+irrationalwife> Agro is for peasants. Lords play control
[2022-12-24 03:11:44] <chromat1> its just a worse agro mage
[2022-12-24 03:11:57] <%BabyRage_HS> @irrationalwife facts
[2022-12-24 03:12:50] <+datfrogger> frickin A i have lethal

[2022-12-24 03:13:03] <%BabyRage_HS> It's so satisfying beating an aggro deck tho
[2022-12-24 03:13:08] <Zaxlor> Can't snipe the top-deck SeemsGood
[2022-12-24 03:13:18] <bizjeet5> and that is how this deck wins
[2022-12-24 03:13:34] VIEWERS: 596
[2022-12-24 03:13:34] <%BabyRage_HS> Agreed
[2022-12-24 03:13:35] <!%pocket_train> control vs DR Rogue is fun because it's free
[2022-12-24 03:13:44] <chromat1> my fave thing in MtG is board wiping elves since 1999
[2022-12-24 03:13:50] <priestgod222> i miss that rogu

[2022-12-24 03:14:35] <!%pocket_train> My favourite matchups are combo vs aggro, trying to survive while also maintaining combo potential
[2022-12-24 03:14:41] <Magnarn1> i enjoy attrition control decks

[2022-12-24 03:16:38] <+pennybagz90> @NoHandsGamer do you know why there isnt a priest card that lets them overheal for a shield like in wow?
[2022-12-24 03:16:41] <+nargas97> @nohandsgamer is demonhunter still good in this meta?
[2022-12-24 03:16:45] <%BabyRage_HS> KEKW
[2022-12-24 03:16:46] <bizjeet5> he might as well leave when double slitherspear hits the board
[2022-12-24 03:17:00] <%+ericBG_> What do ppl in chat think of Frost DK funwise? Unpopular opinion from me - naga priest is far more fun
[2022-12-24 03:17:02] <+AdlerXI> Druid is not dead right now btw i hit legend with a ramp druid (2 nd acc)
[2022-12-24 03:17:09] <+DrEvil69I> is nohandsnamer still good in this meta? Kappa

[2022-12-24 03:17:39] <Yristul> blood dk is good exclusively vs aggro lmao
[2022-12-24 03:17:45] <%snaktray> becuase it's not even great at controlling the board
[2022-12-24 03:17:49] <Yristul> lowkey lacks healing vs burn
[2022-12-24 03:17:55] <jjrodriguezmayo> @ericBG_ I think its ok,  DK was very weark, its tehir time to shine
[2022-12-24 03:17:59] <+DrewStar23> blood dk feels odd
[2022-12-24 03:18:02] <curtarc> Blood DK win condition is too slow compared to other decks
[2022-12-24 03:18:02] <+AdlerXI> zero mana cheat makes blood dk very bad in this mana cheating meta
[2022-12-24 03:18:09] <+animeissinful> It's not good coz it's an arena deck just with more legendaries KEKW

[2022-12-24 03:18:14] <prabh23> It plays like a card or 2 per turn and has clunky high cost cards

[2022-12-24 03:18:24] <+pennybagz90> priest should be able to overheal for a shield

[2022-12-24 03:19:00] <curtarc> Blood DK is like a better CWarrior, but that is not saying much considering CWarrior is like Tier 10

[2022-12-24 03:19:14] <prabh23> @pennybagz90 What would be the point of warrior hero power then
[2022-12-24 03:19:17] <Magnarn1> warrior should start with 30 armor then
[2022-12-24 03:19:18] <JonnyFairplay2000> Why not start priest at 50 life
[2022-12-24 03:19:19] <%+ucdchris1> just discover vampiric blood and u can have ur 40 Kappa
[2022-12-24 03:19:23] <%+ericBG_> And then renathal decreases max health? KEKW
[2022-12-24 03:19:25] <ashen_s0ul> 40 life with 30 cards would be broken lol

[2022-12-24 03:19:59] <%+irrationalwife> change priest hero power to: Passive: Start the game with 40 health

[2022-12-24 03:20:51] <+Smeet2> I played control warrior in early Nathria. It was playable. I just don't think blood DK has a gameplan beyond stay alive and hope to discover something else to do.
[2022-12-24 03:20:56] <curtarc> CWarrior manages to get a 30,3% winrate at top 1000 Legend. Astounding !
[2022-12-24 03:20:57] <colossus_001> vicios slitherspear is a must have in this deck?
[2022-12-24 03:21:04] <%BabyRage_HS> It's sad that warrior is so deadge
[2022-12-24 03:21:07] <prabh23> I have like 50-100 games experimenting with control warrior in legenf
[2022-12-24 03:21:10] <prabh23> Conclusion
[2022-12-24 03:21:12] <prabh23> Don’t play it
[2022-12-24 03:21:27] <prabh23> You only beat frost dk and maybe theif rogue

[2022-12-24 03:21:47] <%+irrationalwife> @colossus_001 you can use the 1/2 that gains +1 attack for each frost spell in hand as an alternative but Slitherspear is probably better

[2022-12-24 03:22:42] <curtarc> At this point I think even if they unnerfed From the Depths and Nellie CWarrior wouldn't even pass the 40% winrate

[2022-12-24 23:07:44] <grimBleeper> also a more aggro meta should keep down the ramp druids even if they can still combo against slower decks

[2022-12-24 23:55:48] <+pero_puff> Guff should become evergreen :)
[2022-12-24 23:55:49] <TheAtheistGod> @atomicwaffleks seems like that goes against the entire point of Astalor being the Manathirst legendary
[2022-12-24 23:55:50] <samodin_> @atomicwaffleks nice idea. May be should add endless infuse too

[2022-12-24 23:56:25] <%+ucdchris1> druid can have a max of 20 mana, but you have to use mana growth cards after 10 to get there
[2022-12-24 23:56:25] <Nihiel1> thoughts?
[2022-12-24 23:56:26] <Mangolorian123> 10 armor is too good, make it 5
[2022-12-24 23:56:27] <sekkaTFT> warrior would still be tier 3 lmao

[2022-12-24 23:56:55] <TheAtheistGod> no automatic mana crystals after 10 could balance it
[2022-12-24 23:56:56] <PaladinIRL> Rogue should start as another class Kappa
[2022-12-24 23:56:58] <%+ucdchris1> warrior should start with 10 armor and their hero power should do 4 armor

[2022-12-24 23:57:32] <erich68> no, mage should have automatic spell damage +1
