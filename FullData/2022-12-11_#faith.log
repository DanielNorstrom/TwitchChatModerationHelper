[2022-12-11 14:13:50] <%+pepemilkshake> my rizz is at least 5 out of 50
[2022-12-11 14:13:54] <+StaysInVegas1> Rizz is NYC slang created by YouTuber and Twitch streamer, Kai Cenat. It refers to a male's ability to impress women aka game, as per Urban Dictionary. Although it's only just circulating on TikTok, the term has existed since at least June 2021 and Cenat has made several videos dedicated to rizz.

[2022-12-11 15:22:29] <Kpl_Kampfsemmel> Automod is just a good 1st line of defense. For things which need more brain and knowledge like knowing that "31" is bad if it's coming from someone who speaks Turkish just requires Good bots and eventually human mods. It's unlucky, but we can't change it.

It's our way of showing support, because we want to prevent the problem to keep causing issues. It might not be what you want at the moment, but it's the way we communicate our interest in people we like. @Faith

[2022-12-11 15:46:33] <aceC5> I have actually noticed that I am social in waves. 1 or 2 days I would be social, and then the next day I would be resting, and it would alternate over and over
