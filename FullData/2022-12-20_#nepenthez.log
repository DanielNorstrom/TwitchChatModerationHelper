[2022-12-20 00:15:33] <%+Kieran96cfc> what could they do to stop making cards go so low? make packs even worse or just remove alot of packs from rewards

[2022-12-20 14:16:18] <Luziph> You never consider making more content just talking podcasts for example and other things?
[2022-12-20 14:16:19] <capitainharrymaguire> Danny also went to facebook

[2022-12-20 14:17:06] <+thenorwegiandrogba> A real no bs, controversial podcast would blow up. You are already very likeable. People listen to you.
[2022-12-20 14:17:06] <gorgeousporgeous> @NepentheZ not anymore. everything even partner is 50 50

[2022-12-20 14:19:32] <timsunessson> I tried a fun team in rivals but its horrible
[2022-12-20 14:19:35] <+smokeymcpot_99> Bringing relegation into rivals would make a huge difference imo
[2022-12-20 14:19:37] <+M4N5F1ELD_> Rivals stinks ive got nothing to play tho everything else is done
[2022-12-20 14:19:41] <benburridge42> Why don‚Äôt you like rivals?
[2022-12-20 14:19:46] <+babyice_> This fifa I have an RTG with the top players in the game and I‚Äôve no interest in playing it anymore idk why
[2022-12-20 14:19:46] <%ryanb2717> people are scared to play hard matches against equally level opponents
[2022-12-20 14:19:47] <%+thegoslow> @NepentheZ You thought about going to ***? 95% rev for streamer- Trainswrecks twitch alt site
[2022-12-20 14:19:48] <fifasweat97> all we need is tourneys with good rewards

[2022-12-20 14:19:51] <+thenorwegiandrogba> No SBMM would even it out
[2022-12-20 14:19:52] <Baine95> even the pros are struggling for motivation this year gorilla said he doesnt know if he will continue @NepentheZ
[2022-12-20 14:19:52] <%+whufcconnor> Afternoon neppo!
[2022-12-20 14:19:54] <Luziph> So podcasts will be starting after Christmas mate?
[2022-12-20 14:19:59] <+arobson094> Why don't you do something with your viewers, like a tourny or something?

[2022-12-20 14:20:03] <fordykyle1> preach
[2022-12-20 14:20:03] <cp09888> they need to bring back relegation imo
[2022-12-20 14:20:06] <Navi_gate> We need the daily knock out tornement again
[2022-12-20 14:20:08] <%+Kieran96cfc> Maybe next season dont get promoted
[2022-12-20 14:20:09] <BigBaz89> swaps gameplay is absolute dog bollocks
[2022-12-20 14:20:16] <j4ckt__01> Will u upload ur podcast to Spotify?
[2022-12-20 14:20:16] <TzortziTime> @dazbala10 apart from nep Ofc you‚Äôre the second goat
[2022-12-20 14:20:16] <benburridge42> I find it fun being seriously sweaty - it‚Äôs more challenging imo. It‚Äôs boring winning all the time
[2022-12-20 14:20:20] <%$chief_maxyj> SBMM makes sense, but for the people that play the game alot, it's just such an L
[2022-12-20 14:20:22] <%+derrickp_13> and cant find anyone in friendlies unless it is the sweaty game modes
[2022-12-20 14:20:24] <@%+Owen_Slater> I used to be shite in FIFA 17, the DKT was a nightmare
[2022-12-20 14:20:25] <fifasweat97> many companys are doing that with their games,cod is exactly the same
[2022-12-20 14:20:25] <tsmithy65> For me champs is the best game mode and most rewarding , then friendlies then rivals then squad battles
[2022-12-20 14:20:26] <%+whufcconnor> To get better you need to get pumped though
[2022-12-20 14:20:27] <alfreddavidssonn> Paint SeemsGood
[2022-12-20 14:20:30] VIEWERS: 1¬†288
[2022-12-20 14:20:30] <%AHumanAlien> probably is a pyramid scheme for EA ha ha
[2022-12-20 14:20:31] <+pumpin_the_guns1> Don‚Äôt know why they wouldn‚Äôt make it so you got small rewards every so many wins on rivals.
[2022-12-20 14:20:32] <%josh_rawlins21057> Painttttttt
[2022-12-20 14:20:33] <snifferii> Hello nep! just got the game. how does the champs work nowdays?

[2022-12-20 14:20:38] <%$hazzat1345> Daily Knockout for a promo player would be brilliant to see again
[2022-12-20 14:20:44] <+MrBigBenoit> Is there SBMM on top of div ranking?
[2022-12-20 14:20:47] <Darkoparko> would be nice to have different tournaments available with differents rewards
[2022-12-20 14:20:51] <Brawnaldo> paint is back

[2022-12-20 14:21:24] <IbbyKanj_> Neppo I just got let off my job and I‚Äôm going through headaches! But I know I‚Äôll push through ! If you can pull through I can pull through keep it up legend !
[2022-12-20 14:21:31] <+m_mxx1> Sadly its the same every week. Playing fut chmaps, qualify again, get those 8 Rivals wins and then Wait for a week. Maybe do some sbc‚Äòs during the week haha
[2022-12-20 14:21:34] <timsunessson> @benburridge42 Its not just about winning, thats not really the point
[2022-12-20 14:21:34] <puppetxvi> Every time I come to the stream all I see is nep complaining lol
[2022-12-20 14:21:41] <yasin_ez_> Nep did u see partey is a winter wildcard?
[2022-12-20 14:21:43] <+thenorwegiandrogba> im in Elite and you cant blink or else youre ***d
[2022-12-20 14:21:52] <benburridge42> @timsunessson but having close challenging games is  fun I think?
[2022-12-20 14:22:07] <%+TheJamieP123> Dereks

[2022-12-20 14:22:09] <%+anth0ny0rrell> i used to play rivals but when SBMM came in i made a new account and not touch rivals
[2022-12-20 14:22:11] <benburridge42> I‚Äôm elite and find it fun against seriously good people - it makes you better
[2022-12-20 14:22:14] <+domele> its crazy to think that ALOT of players dont even know what competitive gaming is
[2022-12-20 14:22:31] VIEWERS: 1¬†288
[2022-12-20 14:22:33] <+dbabbs87> @thenorwegiandrogba out of interest though,. What do we expect in the best division ? I get confused with some of thinking towards it
[2022-12-20 14:22:35] <+cant_touch_this1234> Heya Nep! You good pal?
[2022-12-20 14:22:49] <%iamcroatianeagle> Mind: blown
[2022-12-20 14:22:59] <azeem454> In my opinion EA should add different tournaments based on real life in ultimate team for example the fa cup etc, but instead give the options of giving more packs and coins, therefore there is a different game mode, other than rivals and champs.
[2022-12-20 14:23:09] <+louisw26> Yeah before sbmm in Friendlies some guy had like 200 wins in a row
[2022-12-20 14:23:10] <%+kasper_edv> scoop di whoop
[2022-12-20 14:23:11] <%+whufcconnor> You calling me a top 1% player Nep? I‚Äôm flattered pf23Creep
[2022-12-20 14:23:14] <benburridge42> I don‚Äôt get how what you‚Äôre explaining is a bad thing??
[2022-12-20 14:23:14] <+ajpent1> But this doesn‚Äôt make sense cos u can be semi regular player but be in div 4+
[2022-12-20 14:23:19] <+thenorwegiandrogba> @dbabbs87 never said Elite should be like this, did I? I just said how SBMM is stupid. I have no casual mode to play, and champ/qualifiers takes a day max.
[2022-12-20 14:23:22] <kian_1103> What about splitting an amount of games against different divisions
[2022-12-20 14:23:24] [Notification] kasper_edv subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! [gaming angle]
[2022-12-20 14:23:29] <pablokruk> im div 3 and i dont play champs anymore, i didn't play a single champs match in the whole of fifa 23, is just not enjoyable
[2022-12-20 14:23:30] <@%+Owen_Slater> Its like DKT, most people loved it because it was 4 easy wins for a reward. In 17, I was hideous, and I couldnt get into Champs until the end when they added qualification for most games instead of winning it
[2022-12-20 14:23:34] <benburridge42> Surely, surely it makes sense to play people your skill level?
[2022-12-20 14:23:36] <$PennyOfficial> Just play the game, your opinions have never changed the game never will üôà
[2022-12-20 14:23:47] <yasin_ez_> Nep did u see partey is a winter wildcard?
[2022-12-20 14:23:52] <ron_from_duluth> I‚Äôm not good at FIFA but I enjoy playing. I‚Äôm Div 8 but only play a few online per week. Aside from that I‚Äôm a Squad Battles World Class level player
[2022-12-20 14:23:56] <slucify44> these brains are destyoing me smart smart person nep
[2022-12-20 14:23:56] <Darkoparko> @pablokruk champs is fun, is more casual, rivals is boring
[2022-12-20 14:24:00] <m4nny1403> !leaks
[2022-12-20 14:24:01] <+StarboyX0> thats why I stay in div 8
[2022-12-20 14:24:01] <%AHumanAlien> @azeem454 100% They need a variety of different tournments. Could have an open cup so if someone ranked lower beats someone higher ranked get better rewards
[2022-12-20 14:24:02] <+BeRoLn> whats the odds of them matching the top 1% tho, its 1%
[2022-12-20 14:24:05] <loofa717> Every time i see the griddy now, i just laugh because of your video about ¬´Derek¬ª üòÇ absolute class
[2022-12-20 14:24:15] <puppetxvi> So basically you guys just want to be matches with beginners so you can have chill and have easy wins?
[2022-12-20 14:24:19] <@%Witchwalker70> @puppetxvi Are you actually listening to what he's saying or just being toxic for the sake of it
[2022-12-20 14:24:21] <kian_1103> So 5 games div 7 above, 5 games div 5 to 6 then 5 games div 3 to 5 and 5 games elite to div 3
[2022-12-20 14:24:22] <%AHumanAlien> The rules for their form is so bizarre
[2022-12-20 14:24:24] <+dbabbs87> @thenorwegiandrogba I get that. I feel we ask for a lot though. WE smash the game so will easily complete Qualifiers in a day. but not everyone
[2022-12-20 14:24:24] <grantmc23> whats the cap?
[2022-12-20 14:24:27] <+mcscotlanddd> Even div 5 is pretty hard this year
[2022-12-20 14:24:30] <timsunessson> @puppetxvi NotLikeThis
[2022-12-20 14:24:31] <%+beardedlegend83ttv> is that elo
[2022-12-20 14:24:31] <puppetxvi> I am not being toxic

[2022-12-20 14:24:39] <southernmedal_38> Afternoon nep. Hope u well
[2022-12-20 14:24:42] <+placidjack> Been asking myself thr same thing
[2022-12-20 14:24:45] <%LachyHarka> Wouldn't the bottom 90% rarely come up against the top 10% because they would have the same chance of matching the sweats?
[2022-12-20 14:24:47] <+dbabbs87> People have also just got better at the game
[2022-12-20 14:24:53] <adamdaboss237> I hate the cap for friendlies like win ten but 4 a day I get why but it‚Äôs annoying
[2022-12-20 14:24:56] <+dbabbs87> consider that
[2022-12-20 14:25:03] <+scottyhotspur> I always assumed champs was form based on your record? I know Rivals is skill based which makes it less enjoyable
[2022-12-20 14:25:05] <+ajpent1> How‚Äôs this a bad thing tho? Play friendlies if u want to play casual
[2022-12-20 14:25:06] <+joshy_f1997> Cod is similar, you have a couple games then you come up against optic scump
[2022-12-20 14:25:10] <%AHumanAlien> @Owen_Slater Same, it was a real struggle. They should have brought in a Europa league tournament for those who couldn't qualify. Instead they did SBMM
[2022-12-20 14:25:16] <@%Witchwalker70> Saying he's complaining every time you come to the stream is toxic @puppetxvi
[2022-12-20 14:25:17] <+m_mxx1> I mean does EA really care? They just want as much casuals as possible to Play the Game. Its Not about us that Love the Game and Try to Play Roughly every day right
[2022-12-20 14:25:20] <%$chief_maxyj> if fifa ever stops working out for you, you can just become an artist @NepentheZ
[2022-12-20 14:25:20] <+thenorwegiandrogba> @dbabbs87 If you are Elite in this game, realistically you should win 95%+ of your games. WIth SBMM you will be more like 50/50, just like the guy in div 7
[2022-12-20 14:25:22] <hds96> @puppetxvi we need a variety thats all.
[2022-12-20 14:25:22] <kian_1103> Have a look at my recent comments, I believe it‚Äôs the way to go or at least it‚Äôs an idea
[2022-12-20 14:25:26] <unchartedferritory> hi
[2022-12-20 14:25:27] <%+whufcconnor> @joshy_f1997 The GOAT
[2022-12-20 14:25:37] <RyanH03> champs compared to rivals is a walk in the park
[2022-12-20 14:25:41] <martendhfdb> hi neppo how are you
[2022-12-20 14:25:49] <%+anth0ny0rrell> thats what every mode should be
[2022-12-20 14:25:49] <%bazza3166> dont you think there needs to be a mode like rivals though
[2022-12-20 14:25:51] <%$deathskamikaze> But once you hit your ceiling In champs. Every game is sbmm no?
[2022-12-20 14:25:58] <+joshy_f1997> @whufcconnor appreciate that man. You too
[2022-12-20 14:25:59] <%AHumanAlien> @m_mxx1 They don't care, otherwise they would never have done this, or would have fixed by now
[2022-12-20 14:25:59] <%+pwyld91> I feel like I‚Äôve lost 3/4 in a row in champs and it hasn‚Äôt felt any easier though üòÇ
[2022-12-20 14:26:01] <superskarm4> this reminds me of reverse boosting on cod
[2022-12-20 14:26:01] <johnterryspants> Half day get in how‚Äôs it going Nep?
[2022-12-20 14:26:15] <grantmc23> champs is literally the most fun game mode
[2022-12-20 14:26:27] <+dbabbs87> @thenorwegiandrogba I would just assume the easiest way is to play whoever is in your division 100+ or - your skill rating or something. Then other modes for other game modes. Ps I hate it in Elite haha!
[2022-12-20 14:26:27] <+joshy_f1997> Servers in champs are just miles better too
[2022-12-20 14:26:27] <charlie____fox> Watched the player review on Angle
[2022-12-20 14:26:33] VIEWERS: 1¬†350
[2022-12-20 14:26:37] <%AHumanAlien> I found Champs boring because It was always 0/50 outcome for me. If I won a game guaranteed I would lose next one.
[2022-12-20 14:26:48] <Gibboh> Be good in cod too tbh
[2022-12-20 14:26:48] <%AHumanAlien> 50/50 outcome
[2022-12-20 14:26:50] <+joshy_f1997> Cod has it
[2022-12-20 14:26:53] <+Alt839_> Hey nep, What can i Do against a softban? Only Having ps4 tho
[2022-12-20 14:26:53] <trisa05> Hi, I've been playing FIFA on PC but have had frame lag issues for about a month and have updated all drivers, any suggestions?
[2022-12-20 14:27:00] <puppetxvi> Ok, how is saying he always complains being ‚Äútoxic‚Äù?lol
[2022-12-20 14:27:01] <brogrammer0611> draft also?
[2022-12-20 14:27:03] <kian_1103> Look at my recent idea I commented
[2022-12-20 14:27:03] <yasin_ez_> Nep did u see partey is a winter wildcard?
[2022-12-20 14:27:04] <taylorsgaming1> @nepenthez have you got an advice for someone who is starting out streaming
[2022-12-20 14:27:05] <cp09888> since they've made all online objectives in friendlies why don't they bring back relegation? is it because ppl will abuse it for skill based matching?
[2022-12-20 14:27:09] <+baldnose> @puppetxvi what are friendlies based on now?
[2022-12-20 14:27:10] <trisa05> i've never had any problems
[2022-12-20 14:27:10] <+NoToeJoe7> I‚Äôd kill for a tournament/cup mode that was free to enter.
[2022-12-20 14:27:10] <%+gpnick7> it explain how every weekend  I find it sweaty in quali easy at the start of chmps a little twitchy in the middle then plain sailing at the end and rinse and repeat
[2022-12-20 14:27:12] <%FUTDAN26> Until people start throwing games to get easier opponents
[2022-12-20 14:27:16] <%+helburger> Best winterswaps options?
[2022-12-20 14:27:16] <+scottyhotspur> What coffee you gone for?
[2022-12-20 14:27:16] <%bazza3166> i dont agree with that tbh. sometimes i wanna sweat fifa so i play rivals
[2022-12-20 14:27:17] <tsmithy65> For me I like champs the most , then draft , then friendlies , then rivals then squad battles
[2022-12-20 14:27:18] <f3lixwalk3r> is martinez good?
[2022-12-20 14:27:22] <Kuhrim> i feel like they need more gamemodes
[2022-12-20 14:27:25] <%+Michael_Conroy> I would love every new season to get put back to div 10. Then people can work their way back up to what level they want to be at. Going back two divisions is just not enough. I HATE rivals as every game feels like life or death. I actually don't even know why I play it to be honest.
[2022-12-20 14:27:25] <+StarboyX0> about the mm
[2022-12-20 14:27:28] <hds96> Or have more games modes bases on form and leave Rivals for practice
[2022-12-20 14:27:28] <%+whufcconnor> You wasn‚Äôt mate
[2022-12-20 14:27:29] <yasin_ez_> Nep did u see partey is a winter wildcard
[2022-12-20 14:27:31] <m4nny1403> Not that guy
[2022-12-20 14:27:33] <+placidjack> You're not allowed opinions or ideas
[2022-12-20 14:27:35] <+joshy_f1997> The lights in bmouth are nice nep. Lots of things to do. Just hopefully it doesn‚Äôt rain for you
[2022-12-20 14:27:35] <$GrizzzlyFX> how is he complaining? he's explaining a flaw in how matchmaking works.
[2022-12-20 14:27:36] <johnterryspants> Jog on out of the stream then lil
[2022-12-20 14:27:38] <%+Brandez84> weren't complaining he was explaining it
[2022-12-20 14:27:40] <+arobson094> @trisa05 Are you playing in full screen mode
[2022-12-20 14:27:44] <tarkoffski> How many winter wildcard swap tokens will there be?
[2022-12-20 14:27:46] <xOmsSs96> the thing is, casuals have plenty to do with 30 games of champs on top of potentially squad battles and divisions so I don't think they will change it because once again its only small majority of us affected
[2022-12-20 14:27:46] <m4nny1403> It‚Äôs ur opinion lol
[2022-12-20 14:27:48] <%bateson87> pack battle again?

[2022-12-20 14:27:54] <cp09888> since they've made all online objectives in friendlies why don't they bring back relegation? is it because ppl will abuse it for skill based matching?

[2022-12-20 14:27:57] <%+zoyebali> smetimes i question my own ears as people hear things so differently to me, such a clear explanantion!
[2022-12-20 14:27:57] <andrew_maggipint0> I don't even play rivals because I want to have favorable match making in friendlies. much more to get out of friendlies than rivals
[2022-12-20 14:27:58] <%bateson87> shauna4MJ
[2022-12-20 14:27:59] <+thenorwegiandrogba> @dbabbs87 well I still win like 70-80% of my rivals games. Div 1 I was unbeaten, but yeah. WL is tough once I go 7-0 and I accept that. Rivals should be no SBMM and the game will be fun again
[2022-12-20 14:27:59] <%+portagoon> Not complaining, explaining. There is a difference.
[2022-12-20 14:28:01] <smitemaca> At least friendlies should be casual

[2022-12-20 14:46:51] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> Honestly dont think they will. They have always been a "collection" based company. The problem with NFT's is that theyve been introduced as collectibles or works of art. That is one of the worst utilities of that technology.

[2022-12-20 14:49:54] <Omarelli> in terms of selling the legos: keep the tutorial books and keep the boxes as clean as possible

[2022-12-20 14:51:43] <here4rewards_> I think there should be a digital and physical version of every card
[2022-12-20 14:51:46] <ARusso258> it's so much better physical
[2022-12-20 14:51:49] <+bigtime_247> It‚Äôs a reasonable argument. But not applicable in our lifetime

[2022-12-20 14:51:57] <%josh_rawlins21057> For the owner to see physical copy
[2022-12-20 14:52:01] <JammieDodge191> @omarelli yeah defo, I‚Äôm convinced I have some valuable legos in the loft from my childhood ready to be sold straight up lol
[2022-12-20 14:52:02] <%+Kieran96cfc> but doesnt it feel better actually being able to hold the card and see it compared to on the screen
[2022-12-20 14:52:08] <%s_embo> because it is a physical item . i could screenshot any digital card in the world
[2022-12-20 14:52:10] <%+whufcconnor> with signed cards though? patch worn?
[2022-12-20 14:52:13] <%AHumanAlien> 100%%%
[2022-12-20 14:52:16] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> I just think something physical will always have the edge. Theres soemthing about it being tactile that makes it different. Even though Im seeing it digitally, its real and interactive on your side and I can see that.
[2022-12-20 14:52:22] <here4rewards_> Would you have a signed Arsenal jersey as NFT
[2022-12-20 14:52:26] <%+heresthett> anyone can google something & see an image of it
[2022-12-20 14:52:29] <layton754> It just feels better physically
[2022-12-20 14:52:29] <%+gourjamz> I think the issue between the 2 is that you could just make more digital stuff for free that physical stuff can be reproduced but it won‚Äôt be orginal
[2022-12-20 14:52:35] <%$hazzat1345> I understand but for example signed cards wouldn‚Äôt feel the same
[2022-12-20 14:52:35] <%$Rocastle78> The best digital cards I've seen is the way you can look at your cards on NBA2K23... the was you can move them and flip them, and the light catches them - they look beautiful

[2022-12-20 14:52:58] <%jordan97jw> would be sick if you could claim a physical version but it can only be done once per NFT and if you sell it then someone else can claim it but only if its never been claimed then when its claim it would lose value

[2022-12-20 15:00:01] <@%AaronBrookes94> Highly doubtful the blockchain can collapse simply because there's a very little in terms of actual real world assists. However because of that it is a lot easier to disrupt and potentially finish it completely

[2022-12-20 15:01:07] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> The problem with FI was that, for the business model to work, you needed enough transfers of stocks and new money entering the market to finance the money they were paying out in dividends. When that balance went the wrong way, they reduced the dividends and that just demolished the market and everyone wanted out. That just put it in an absolute death spiral.

[2022-12-20 16:45:48] <%+marinoatlason> I have a theory that some gold cards are not in draft, because it's always the same players
[2022-12-20 16:45:49] <Brawnaldo> give this guy and his guest the win<3
[2022-12-20 16:45:52] <TimLumb> no Emi Martinez is maybe the most surprising
[2022-12-20 16:45:56] <%+amatthew87> Every player should be in draft

[2022-12-20 18:02:09] <+0lly> Chem styles go would be good, only use 5 at most of them. Just pack fillers
[2022-12-20 18:02:09] <FILLEFJUTTEN> do you speak much with jj these days?
[2022-12-20 18:02:11] <%+thegoslow> @nepenthez have you looked at kick yet?
[2022-12-20 18:02:13] <%Exothermicc> So there's more than 374 players 81+ rating and 49 of them are Spanish...
[2022-12-20 18:02:15] <%blazer33x> maybe they could have a separate mode no chem
[2022-12-20 18:02:17] <r6pengo> by the time of endgame we wont need to boost the stats with chem styles so we can use any players we want without any negatibes tbf
[2022-12-20 18:02:22] <%+ray_rockwood> Remember the FIFA where there was a glitch and chemistry didn't matter? Playing that Mexican left back at striker. Haha
[2022-12-20 18:02:22] <zriqoe> ah im idiot
[2022-12-20 18:02:26] <suryansh756> chem system is very bad
[2022-12-20 18:02:28] <%+609blazers> Keep chem styles but everyone gets full chem. So you can apply the full chem boost toward defending shooting dribbling defending how you want to use the card
[2022-12-20 18:02:30] <%+mikekozy23> di maria is cheap lul
[2022-12-20 18:02:41] <+BotBill32> That is interesting, and finally it would actually mean(to you) you could literally build your version of an actual ultimate team, with these chem restrictions, it can never be ulitmate.
[2022-12-20 18:02:44] <Mcr_xMaYheMx> think we will see the end of tradable cards before chem goes

[2022-12-20 18:11:03] <@%+Owen_Slater> And its no surprise FIFA 20 Futmas was the worst one, its because the idea was outdated and needed changing
[2022-12-20 18:11:05] <%+stickz__rr> 3 sbcs a day was great
[2022-12-20 18:11:16] <%+stickz__rr> like the idea of that is good
[2022-12-20 18:11:20] <%+stickz__rr> but the cards they released were shit
[2022-12-20 18:11:23] <%+stickz__rr> i agree with that
[2022-12-20 18:11:26] <@%+Owen_Slater> @stickz__rr Lad, during WC we were getting 2 showdowns most days, and was WC good?

[2022-12-20 18:16:47] <+rmartin31> @leunamand they literally don‚Äôt care about this iteration at all, just cleaning up the cash
[2022-12-20 18:16:48] <%therealcathal> i think Tripper is very close to TOTT Dalot, who is 180k, and Trippier is effectively free

[2022-12-20 18:30:40] <%$deathskamikaze> i got giving 6 wc picks i dindt want
[2022-12-20 18:30:42] <hooky3333> What are you wanting to achieve by doing a 6 hour RTG?
[2022-12-20 18:30:47] <+NFFC_Lovey> I logged on today and had 6 random World Cup play picks
[2022-12-20 18:30:49] <%danthewolvesfan> that's why I had a random 5 wc player picks
[2022-12-20 18:30:52] <%bolts2thecup> Was playing rivals games chat we we looking at
[2022-12-20 18:30:54] <Mcr_xMaYheMx> i got 10 picks today so thats why
[2022-12-20 18:30:54] <+jefzy_> Is this a only one day 6 hour rtg?
[2022-12-20 18:30:57] <jarko_musinko> so how many wc swaps came out in total 54?
[2022-12-20 18:30:58] <%+adamo419> so that's why i got 4 player picks for some random reason üòÇ
[2022-12-20 18:30:59] <jsaps1871> What‚Äôs the aim of this 6 hour rtg? To see how good your team can get? How many coins you can make? How much progress you can make?
[2022-12-20 18:31:00] <+Cavacom> how many swaps you think u can get
[2022-12-20 18:31:03] <+Ryan23961> That might explain why I just got 10 random World Cup players üòÇ
[2022-12-20 18:31:05] <cerys_fifa> you could do 100 finesses
[2022-12-20 18:31:17] <@%Viperlization> nah its not impossible
[2022-12-20 18:31:22] <@%Viperlization> you can defo do it with rqs
[2022-12-20 18:31:29] <Mr_Arneg> you'll need about 20 wins in rivals
[2022-12-20 18:31:29] <@%+Owen_Slater> Rivals at D10 gives like 10/20 points a win
[2022-12-20 18:31:32] <jamie_bv123> i have 84x20x3. should i open it at 6pm???
[2022-12-20 18:31:34] <%+SamSurg3> Nep did u finish the Tott cup ?? did u get the Big trophy ???
[2022-12-20 18:31:38] <@%Viperlization> you'd get rqs all the way to div 6
[2022-12-20 18:31:39] <+GeorgeCuz> you'd need like 40+ wins in those 4 hors
[2022-12-20 18:31:40] VIEWERS: 2¬†742
[2022-12-20 18:31:43] <%$coys51> div 10 you get shit points though
[2022-12-20 18:31:43] <r1chstace> u get barely any points down in the low leagues
[2022-12-20 18:31:48] <%CrazyEskimoPenguin> You get very few champs points in the early divs tho
[2022-12-20 18:31:52] <%$Rocastle78> Your points per win in Div 10 etc are horrifically low
[2022-12-20 18:31:52] <%+DeanCrawfordTWA> Why have we got to wait 15 more days for these World Cup rewards? I‚Äôve got well over 1000 of these players‚Ä¶just a pain at this point
[2022-12-20 18:31:52] <+jefzy_> Not many people rq actually in div 10, they just stay in the game
[2022-12-20 18:31:53] <@%+Owen_Slater> As someone who just been through that process, people in D10 are so bad, they dont RQ
[2022-12-20 18:31:55] <fatalityonme_> i can comfirm i made an account a week ago and div 10 players rage quit after a goal
[2022-12-20 18:31:57] <@%Viperlization> it's doable
[2022-12-20 18:31:58] <j4ckt__01> What is he trying to do? Is he starting a new road to glory?
[2022-12-20 18:32:06] <+jefzy_> Agreed @owen_slater
[2022-12-20 18:32:07] <+crotzer2010> Ivan Toney up to 262 breaches now üò≥ his season is definitely over
[2022-12-20 18:32:07] <%DmacPrototype> Hey Neppo, hey Josh, hey chat
[2022-12-20 18:32:08] <Zak_5> why not makeit a 1 week rtg
[2022-12-20 18:32:09] <+jayden_joshua21> Season ends Thursday as well so you might get people rubber banding
[2022-12-20 18:32:15] <%+jameswycombe182> Good evening nep, hope you are well :)
[2022-12-20 18:32:16] <+jsarrami> do a 2 day RTG there more fun
[2022-12-20 18:32:23] <+KhatoXII> You don't get a lot of Champs points in Div 10. Even less if it is a RQ, I think
[2022-12-20 18:32:23] <henry428> i did this yesterday from div 10 in rivals im 16-0 in div 6 now, halfway on champs points
[2022-12-20 18:32:24] <shaqqiifresh10> only way to find out is to try it
[2022-12-20 18:32:25] <horr0h> you played a game yet today @NepentheZ the gameplay is the heaviest its ever been
[2022-12-20 18:32:29] <+jsarrami> the minimal hours ones are a scramble
[2022-12-20 18:32:30] <8met_> My brudda Neppo how are you doing today
[2022-12-20 18:32:32] <@%+Owen_Slater> Although, one benefit, you can do the "Win 6" tokens while qualifying, which could make the 3x84x20 doable
[2022-12-20 18:32:34] <j4ckt__01> Nep u starting a new road to glory?
[2022-12-20 18:32:47] <+Cavacom> episode 2 can be q'ing for WL
[2022-12-20 18:32:53] <+jsarrami> 2 day, one day offline grind for swaps tokens for the packs and then another day of rivals and champs
[2022-12-20 18:32:54] <%+jamesob2903> that sounds like a better idea
[2022-12-20 18:32:55] <+KhatoXII> You can do like a Series
[2022-12-20 18:32:56] <AbdulTarar> @Owen_Slater you can't do the win 6 tokens in rivals
[2022-12-20 18:33:00] <cerys_fifa> yes
[2022-12-20 18:33:03] <+KhatoXII> 6Hours RTG
[2022-12-20 18:33:05] <@%Viperlization> so many sbcs to build a team
[2022-12-20 18:33:07] <+Pughy30> You could do it based on how high a squad rating you can achieve in 6 hours
[2022-12-20 18:33:07] <+jsarrami> Wednesday and Thursday
[2022-12-20 18:33:08] <@%Viperlization> dynamic duos
[2022-12-20 18:33:09] <@%+Owen_Slater> @AbdulTarar Well I must have broke the system cos I did
[2022-12-20 18:33:11] <%+DeanCrawfordTWA> Varane, Robertson, Kimmich have been leaked for WWC
[2022-12-20 18:33:12] <%+jameswycombe182> is there anything due to drop today? or rumoured too
[2022-12-20 18:33:24] <@%Viperlization> all the fodder you'll have for meta cards
[2022-12-20 18:33:34] <@%+Owen_Slater> If you do go via rivals, you can so easily do the "Win 6" objectives
[2022-12-20 18:33:34] <+viilz9> You can get 5x WC Players for 3 Bronze players in the SBC to build a starter team
[2022-12-20 18:33:39] <+reece_1995> tifo packs galore
[2022-12-20 18:33:39] <AbdulTarar> @Owen_Slater the objective literally says win 6 in live fut friendlies lmao
[2022-12-20 18:33:41] VIEWERS: 2¬†838
[2022-12-20 18:33:50] <TTVAL7> Are League SBC's coming tonight?

[2022-12-20 18:33:53] <@%Viperlization> very meta
[2022-12-20 18:34:01] <%+clanwalk3r> moments is tradeable
[2022-12-20 18:34:06] <henry428> di maria + kean potm i got very easily
[2022-12-20 18:34:06] <freysi123> and Keane to link to Dima
[2022-12-20 18:34:11] <degraff9> are you resetting cub?
[2022-12-20 18:34:14] <@%+Owen_Slater> @AbdulTarar "Win 6 matches in SB semi pro (or rivals) having at least 6 Belgian WC player items in your starting squad"
[2022-12-20 18:34:17] <+reece_1995> @AbdulTarar there is rivals ones win 6 and play 8 which give tokens as well
[2022-12-20 18:34:21] <xxxxsiuuuxxxx> chat any idea on when we can start grinding ww swaps?
[2022-12-20 18:34:28] <em8751> cheeky lil keylor navas
[2022-12-20 18:34:43] <+KhatoXII> 7 games
[2022-12-20 18:34:43] <@%Viperlization> 7 i think josh
[2022-12-20 18:34:47] <@%Viperlization> in 7 seperates
[2022-12-20 18:34:48] <AbdulTarar> @Owen_Slater ah you're talking about those ones, i get you, although there's only like 2 or 3 of those rivals ones
[2022-12-20 18:34:49] <@%+Owen_Slater> Bare in mind, rivals is so dumb easy, do it in rivals
[2022-12-20 18:34:52] <%+DeanCrawfordTWA> You need seven wins
[2022-12-20 18:35:01] <+Cavacom> u can get 2 swaps tokens an hour if you win every friendly
[2022-12-20 18:35:07] <+Craig951> get the french token too
[2022-12-20 18:35:07] <+Lukeflynn89> Do you got time to start this today, sounds like it will be a fun watch??
[2022-12-20 18:35:11] <@%Viperlization> you could get all dynamic duos in rivals, aswell as pavard
[2022-12-20 18:35:11] <@%+Owen_Slater> You could also do the "Win 6" tokens from showcase in rivals
[2022-12-20 18:35:11] <georgiapeplow27> 3 bronzes for the WC cards would make a decent team
[2022-12-20 18:35:14] <%+DeanCrawfordTWA> Assist with a defender too
[2022-12-20 18:35:29] <x5noopy> You could do the play 8 with France swap token with pavard
[2022-12-20 18:35:31] <yankeeman352> whats happening here?
[2022-12-20 18:35:35] <%+anth0ny0rrell> When you starting this?
[2022-12-20 18:35:38] <@%+Owen_Slater> You get the 6 when you score one
[2022-12-20 18:35:41] <Ro0kz> if your going to be in div 10 might be quicker to do it all in rivals no?

[2022-12-20 18:35:50] <+reece_1995> can get so much done in 6 hours, pretty mad actually.
[2022-12-20 18:35:54] <@%+Owen_Slater> So if you gonna do Pavard, you may as well whack 6 into the team
[2022-12-20 18:35:56] <+HoosBean> Update: messi still hasn‚Äôt let go of the World Cup üòÇ
[2022-12-20 18:36:02] <+rigby1968> this fifa would not be bad with some league sbcs the promo teams arent bad theres a load of sbcs but no way to get packs lol

[2022-12-20 18:37:27] <+Cavacom> if you play with an additional GK in outfield position, you can switch out the starting GK to score
[2022-12-20 18:37:28] <beanzgaming21> you think the 81x11 is gonna give out?
[2022-12-20 18:37:28] <@%+Owen_Slater> Well if you score with an Englush player, you get 6 WC English anyway
[2022-12-20 18:37:32] <+Craig951> 8 with france, can do with pavard
[2022-12-20 18:37:34] <%+theoldmanrtg7619> How did your fair with your twich pack neppo?

[2022-12-20 18:39:05] <%+adamo419> picking a Major Nation as your Wc Starter pack would be smart aswell
[2022-12-20 18:39:20] <+Cavacom> @adamo419 u mean Qatar
[2022-12-20 18:39:30] <@%+Owen_Slater> Need to do them for Swaps (I spent 2 hours trying to pack 2 from one club on my pack only account)

[2022-12-20 18:40:15] <@%+Owen_Slater> Its probably against the spirit, but whatever coins you have, you could chuck into those 75x5 WC packs if it was just for immediate effect
[2022-12-20 18:40:18] <%+anth0ny0rrell> I did two new ones to see what I get at same time one I got a 88 quad in 24 hours and the second was a 84 squad
[2022-12-20 18:40:20] <girldiator> Nice plan
[2022-12-20 18:40:33] <%iamcroatianeagle> Nep, as a majority owner of Arsenal, can we count on you to buy a new striker?
[2022-12-20 18:40:48] <%Prynner11> Evening nep hope all is well
[2022-12-20 18:40:50] <+orhando_> Looking forward to nontent today?
[2022-12-20 18:40:53] <@%+Owen_Slater> 3 players to 5 is decent, and their pack weight is good
[2022-12-20 18:41:09] <masonbros8> Is this a new series?
[2022-12-20 18:41:14] <%+rockmanl0l> plus better chance of better players for the futchamps squad if you use the world cup cards
[2022-12-20 18:41:28] <%+ray_rockwood> I hope Nep packs TOTT Mbappe or TOTT Messi in his first pack so he can end the video quick. Haha

[2022-12-20 18:42:11] <@%+Owen_Slater> Like the starter pack you get will have 18 or so bronzes, you can turn that into 30 WC cards, which saves coins and could give good cards
[2022-12-20 18:42:14] <%therealcathal> i hope w get a party bag type sbc today

[2022-12-20 18:58:19] <%+Kieran96cfc> I think people have done it trading to 1mil ect
[2022-12-20 18:58:21] <%+thegoslow> it's got to the point that the market is so saturated you have to play two games at once using all your limbs to get noticed LUL

[2022-12-20 18:58:46] <campcrystal> Traders do speed runs all the time.
[2022-12-20 18:58:46] <%$deathskamikaze> i can go 0-20 in about 20 mins. beat that

[2022-12-20 18:58:51] <%+derrickp_13> besides matthdgamer with so many days or hours you can get a meta team
[2022-12-20 18:58:52] <+jamescwood> Moments speed run has potential too
[2022-12-20 18:58:52] <xYounes97> yeah outside of fut champs there's not much
[2022-12-20 18:58:54] <+ajaayy> I don't think there will be speed runs incorporating the whole gameplay aspects
[2022-12-20 18:58:55] <Bret__> I think you can differentiate a fut champs speed run from a menu grind speed run
[2022-12-20 18:58:55] <@%Viperlization> good chance pal
[2022-12-20 18:59:00] <+domy2602> I can do a speed run o 20 minutes, but if I go 0-20
[2022-12-20 18:59:01] <+SCF08onFIFA> Fuji does it every week for champs on stream

[2022-12-20 18:59:04] <+GeorgeCuz> the hard thing will be choosing things that are able to be completed hundreds of times on the same acc
[2022-12-20 18:59:04] <%$istreet98> look at the speed running website, there's some categories but nothing solid
[2022-12-20 18:59:04] <basdvsg1998> fuji does speedrun every week
[2022-12-20 18:59:05] <%sorarejosh> 11wins fut champs speedrun will pop off imo

[2022-12-20 18:59:12] <@%Viperlization> champs speed runs dont count
[2022-12-20 18:59:12] <Neoranto> the Career Speedrun Any% looks grim

[2022-12-20 18:59:13] <%+ray_rockwood> How about speed running to who has the highest club value in a certain amount of time without spending FIFA points?
[2022-12-20 18:59:15] <r6pengo> i swear if while you do this rtg someone steals it

[2022-12-20 18:59:35] <+IGoByJeff> Fut champs speed runs aren‚Äôt as accessible as other more fun categories

[2022-12-20 19:46:58] <leunamand> I saw a guy get both Azmoun ptg and gold in the same pack
[2022-12-20 19:46:59] <%+marknorman92> it's one guaranteed player from the promo
[2022-12-20 19:46:59] <thethirdkey3> you get a guaranteed ptg not any of them
[2022-12-20 19:47:00] <%+mikekozy23> the special card is independent of the gold card
[2022-12-20 19:47:04] <darkfifer> That store pack so pathetic from EA, just sad
[2022-12-20 19:47:04] <experiment626_squish> you can get gold and special at the same time
[2022-12-20 19:47:04] <peydrow> yes
[2022-12-20 19:47:04] <wastedash> One special is rolled separately, then the gold players
[2022-12-20 19:47:04] <+TaeTae> 1 special and the rest is "normal" cards
[2022-12-20 19:47:05] <%+eddg_023> So you can get Gold Messi and PTG Hincapi√© LUL

[2022-12-20 19:47:05] <+grimmers88> I imagine it picks the special from a pool and then the rest from everything in packs
[2022-12-20 19:47:06] <Brady2109> oh yeah coz you got a gold Wijnaldum aswell as the special in the video
[2022-12-20 19:47:06] <mohammadhwiedi> of vini ya

[2022-12-20 19:47:25] <alfabetac> yes
[2022-12-20 19:47:26] <%+mikekozy23> the special is independent of the golds
[2022-12-20 19:47:29] <%Dezalleycat> That is absolutely vile
[2022-12-20 19:47:29] <leunamand> You can get both Lukakus yeah

[2022-12-20 19:47:34] <snoopdog_125> huh
[2022-12-20 19:47:34] <jacobf1717> this is oiterally how every fuckin pack works ever
[2022-12-20 19:47:34] <ssfahim_1> LUL
[2022-12-20 19:47:34] <princehairry> it's only 1 guarenteed, the rest is all random. not that hard
[2022-12-20 19:47:35] <%johnfive21> you could get gold Mbappe even though he as RTWC card
[2022-12-20 19:47:35] <+Tone2Fifteen> its not
[2022-12-20 19:47:37] <%m3elv1n> its like opening 2 packs at once
[2022-12-20 19:47:38] <wastedash> yes exactly. That's how all of these have been this year
[2022-12-20 19:47:39] <+WillBride> it‚Äôs not a ‚Äòcurrent‚Äô promo so the cards are still available
[2022-12-20 19:47:39] <+ismilann> Its always been like that tho
[2022-12-20 19:47:39] <+PlupertV2> The guarantee is its own pool, the rest of the rare golds are based on what's in packs rn. Technically PTG isn't in packs
[2022-12-20 19:47:40] <justaskingaq> i think it‚Äôs fair tbh
[2022-12-20 19:47:41] <TonyVWPT> that is beyond atrocious
[2022-12-20 19:47:41] <+sayado_> nep got gold wijnaldum in his pack with the rttwc wijnaldum too
[2022-12-20 19:47:42] <%djz19_> i thought it‚Äôs always like that?

[2022-12-20 19:47:43] <+supersims2> Imagine getting gold nkunku hahahaha
[2022-12-20 19:47:43] <+sergibonga> Ptg isn‚Äôt in packs so you‚Äôll get the normal card unless it‚Äôs the year in review one
[2022-12-20 19:47:44] <+Tone2Fifteen> it makes total sense
[2022-12-20 19:47:45] <jih3105> Its just logical
[2022-12-20 19:47:46] <%$carlos05t> you got normal wij in your pack nep

[2022-12-20 19:47:50] <kneck238> You can tenchnically Get mbappe tott and road to the world cup
[2022-12-20 19:47:50] <+MiernikGaming> imagine you get two players from the promo and it rolls the crap one like gold vini and ptg osori

[2022-12-20 19:47:56] <+stripey155> makes sense
[2022-12-20 19:47:56] <Bret__> It's not fair at all

[2022-12-20 19:48:16] <jamesstott95> Where do you get the third winter wildcats player?
[2022-12-20 19:48:16] <%+chemicallocust> It
[2022-12-20 19:48:16] <+Tone2Fifteen> no for some rare golds or any other special cards in packs atm
[2022-12-20 19:48:16] <Mcr_xMaYheMx> so u have more chance to get the gold  then
[2022-12-20 19:48:18] <%s_embo> it says 1
[2022-12-20 19:48:18] <xquasarx> its not
[2022-12-20 19:48:18] <Awon_> thats how it always is?
[2022-12-20 19:48:19] <+RazorKameo> no chance thats fair
[2022-12-20 19:48:21] <aaronconvey1999> Packed vini jr in the store pack, doesn‚Äôt fit my untradeable team and have no coins to change team
[2022-12-20 19:48:21] <wastedash> it's scummy, but they tell you. I think it should be the other way
[2022-12-20 19:48:21] <+gamegas22> so if u open it own risk
[2022-12-20 19:48:23] <+aseru7> You could get TOTTs no?
[2022-12-20 19:48:23] <+ClubCrackerz> You can get special cards just not special cards that aren't in packs
[2022-12-20 19:48:24] <%+tobywankenobi101> yeah it's fair
[2022-12-20 19:48:25] <%Dezalleycat> It means to me the the packs aren‚Äôt random in that case,pre determined
[2022-12-20 19:48:25] <%LukePingu> im not touching that pack LUL
[2022-12-20 19:48:25] <justaskingaq> @senor_8a exactly

[2022-12-20 19:48:27] <asb71> they say it's fair here then go cry to another streamer
[2022-12-20 19:48:28] <+Natty1904> no difference
[2022-12-20 19:48:28] <%+glenposh> EA have messed with peoples heads
[2022-12-20 19:48:29] <Saif_Gebreel> No way it's fair, but such is life

[2022-12-20 19:48:30] <+mackam69> Yeah you got dupe WIJNALDUM you got him twice once gold check vid
[2022-12-20 19:48:31] <jacobf1717> its literally how every party bag works
[2022-12-20 19:48:31] <thethirdkey3> it's not fair but it is what it says
[2022-12-20 19:48:32] <+ismilann> You are getting a rare gold player pack with 1 special card. Its horribly prices but you know what you are getting.
[2022-12-20 19:48:32] <neil1989> they have put it in description tho
[2022-12-20 19:48:32] <letmehaveanameman> you wouldn't be able to get mbappe tott otherwise
[2022-12-20 19:48:32] <%johnfive21> Any store pack that's untradable is unfair
[2022-12-20 19:48:33] <princehairry> thats literally what the description of the pack says LUL
[2022-12-20 19:48:33] <TonyVWPT> lots of people here "Hey! You're mistreating the multi-billion dollar company!"
[2022-12-20 19:48:33] <ZackRMB> It's fair based on the fact that you know you're gambling on it in the first place IMO
[2022-12-20 19:48:34] <ProDangIes> if you thought you were gonna get 2 specials in the pack youre a bit dense
[2022-12-20 19:48:34] <+gamegas22> thats bs nep
[2022-12-20 19:48:34] <fitzyyy7> It's crap but it's what they advertise.
[2022-12-20 19:48:34] <cheaky_barstool> Could you pack two mbappes?
[2022-12-20 19:48:35] <+sjm501> That should say ONLT one
[2022-12-20 19:48:35] <%+antocasey> I got 87 Zakaria in mine so going off these it‚Äôs a massive W
[2022-12-20 19:48:36] <%$jake1q1> Sorry but Ea have the community by the balls of people think that‚Äôs fair üòÇüòÇüòÇ
[2022-12-20 19:48:36] <JaySsack> it's gambling, they aren't misleading anyone.  I know I'm not buying this pack though
[2022-12-20 19:48:37] <+grimmers88> Does that mean you could theoretically pack the same player twice in a pack, the gold and their special @NepentheZ
[2022-12-20 19:48:38] <+keano1967> It‚Äôs fair
[2022-12-20 19:48:39] <xiiket> Scummy
[2022-12-20 19:48:40] <+gamegas22> it says it good
[2022-12-20 19:48:40] <+smokeymcpot_99> Did you think it was a full pack of promo players or something?
[2022-12-20 19:48:40] <%$jake1q1> If*
[2022-12-20 19:48:45] <wastedash> I think they do make it clear, I just don't like it still
[2022-12-20 19:48:45] <jih3105> The pack isnt worth it, but its still logical
[2022-12-20 19:48:45] <+chiller702> not a single TOTT packed smh
[2022-12-20 19:48:45] <+stripey155> pretty clear its always been like that
[2022-12-20 19:48:45] <ayyytrick> Imagine getting osorio and gold vini LUL
[2022-12-20 19:48:46] <%simplefifayt> gives more chance of shitty rares i guess
[2022-12-20 19:48:46] <%+stackmillz> should b a min garentee
[2022-12-20 19:48:50] <+wingnuttttt> Na your right nep should be two if get two players that where
[2022-12-20 19:48:50] <%+glenposh> People are that caught up in the game they just cant see it
[2022-12-20 19:48:52] <+sjm501> It is ambiguous
[2022-12-20 19:48:53] <pasbolaa> minee pls nep
[2022-12-20 19:48:53] <%+WaxiRL> Imagine getting a regular Mbappe instead of his road to the World Cup which is 2.8 mil more
[2022-12-20 19:48:55] <+sjm501> for sure
[2022-12-20 19:48:55] <%+Fvley> the cards aren't in pacls
[2022-12-20 19:48:56] <+keano1967> They literally couldn‚Äôt be clearer lol
[2022-12-20 19:48:56] <kieeeeraaaan> if you daft enough to open the pack then you deserve it
[2022-12-20 19:48:58] <michaelmcallion73> @chiller702 Casemiro?
[2022-12-20 19:49:00] <$Th1sSecretN1nj4> and you got packs that had two specials in them earlier too @NepentheZ

[2022-12-20 19:49:03] <%+mikekozy23> but lukaku isn't in packs to be packed as a special
[2022-12-20 19:49:04] <+PessiIsWashed> I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs possible for Ea to take out his gold out of a specific pack
[2022-12-20 19:49:04] <%+mdelco673> so open for compensation chances?
[2022-12-20 19:49:07] <+hainzyy> it's like a Trading card pack. one slot dedicated to the chase card
[2022-12-20 19:49:07] <%+Freddie14325> Neppo got suspended from school today for cutting someone‚Äôs hair. Is that fair
[2022-12-20 19:49:08] <AbdulTarar> gurantees one means there is one, i dont think anyone though you could get more than 1

[2022-12-20 19:49:14] <+ismilann> It baffles me how many of you guys are willing to do this pack. Its such a shit deal.
[2022-12-20 19:49:17] <+sergibonga> I can‚Äôt believe people genuinely thought it was all specials lol

[2022-12-20 20:17:36] <+MoisMF> how can u be so convinced of yourself? we dont know if thats true
[2022-12-20 20:17:36] <zongorpista> they could just update all argentinians who were at the wc
[2022-12-20 20:17:40] <+sealdawg> Nothing at all wrong with that. They are a business
[2022-12-20 20:17:44] <+meganyeung> but thats just ur speculation right? its not confirmed that they released it an hour late

[2022-12-20 20:18:21] <+ItsAdamTwitch> they started to release certain store packs at 9pm like a token one the other week so you spent points when promo comes out then need more for token

[2022-12-20 20:18:50] <+imthecheetah20> They're almost as bad as gambling companies
[2022-12-20 20:18:51] <+StevenHartley> i think the older people of us are more wiser to it
[2022-12-20 20:18:51] <+Owen_Halsey8> didn't someone say content moved to 7pm? which is weird cause ea should've said imo
[2022-12-20 20:18:51] <+Juckeeh> @chriscfcwooooo Standards? It's their game
[2022-12-20 20:18:52] <+ChineseDan> Yep
[2022-12-20 20:18:53] <+callumalc7> They‚Äôve mugged people off

[2022-12-20 20:18:53] <+MagicXR> epic just recently got sued for predatory marketing. ea can too
[2022-12-20 20:18:54] <$supahmarioo> @mesut1o88 holidays are about giving back, no?
[2022-12-20 20:18:55] <%H0NKTV> perisic or carrasco in the WC pick? who would you go for?
[2022-12-20 20:18:56] <+medocr7777> Wait what happened
[2022-12-20 20:18:58] <JadsonXI> 100%
[2022-12-20 20:18:58] <+BloodBucketz> Epic Games literally just had to pay out over $250 million for predatory store tactics
[2022-12-20 20:18:59] <hussainwasiq09> business means to give value for your time/coins
[2022-12-20 20:19:01] <+polskamg> @sealdawg I think you are missing a point. No one cares - and everyone knows - that they are a business.
[2022-12-20 20:19:01] <+Dripathon_> Nep I‚Äôm with you
[2022-12-20 20:19:01] <%+yasin__7> U doing SharePlay‚Äôs?

[2022-12-20 20:19:03] <warraquadruple> just getting here, whats gone on?
[2022-12-20 20:19:03] <i_cant_find_a_good_name99> exactly ,they will try more and more scummy things as years go by,it WILL get worse
[2022-12-20 20:19:03] <mikegreenyt> are they being twats because last E
[2022-12-20 20:19:05] <here4rewards_> It‚Äôs morally wrong, but is it legally wrong
[2022-12-20 20:19:05] <burnsyla> what will it take from ea for these people to realise how scummy they are
[2022-12-20 20:19:07] <Bellzoi> o no -75k lmao
[2022-12-20 20:19:07] <hussainwasiq09> not business
[2022-12-20 20:19:08] <%$blublud84> but we're still all doing the SBC though
[2022-12-20 20:19:08] <%+DirtyDishFC> If it was a  mistake they should refund everyone their coins or FP's.
[2022-12-20 20:19:08] <+thebricktamlin> just got Guendouzi!
[2022-12-20 20:19:09] <mikegreenyt> edition
[2022-12-20 20:19:12] <HIPPO_________> must be the only company that openly abuses their consumer base
[2022-12-20 20:19:12] <+imherebishes> whos the other guy in the call nep?  recognise the voice but dunno who it is
[2022-12-20 20:19:13] <Mcr_xMaYheMx> it would of been ok if they both got released together but the way they did it is scummy
[2022-12-20 20:19:13] <+RioMeahUK> And yet streamers who arent happy with those being okay with it, will yet still open said pack. banter
[2022-12-20 20:19:13] <%+suraj672004> theyve just aimed a shotgun at my bank card
[2022-12-20 20:19:14] <%+Smudge__Cat> not the first time EA have done this, but just because it's happened before, doesn't take away from our scummy and underhanded it is
[2022-12-20 20:19:16] <+fawkes6191> It‚Äôs a never ending cycle.. we keep giving them exactly what they need and they keep abusing customers..
[2022-12-20 20:19:17] <+ty97x> Apparently last year ea released winter wildcard content at 7 nep, is this true
[2022-12-20 20:19:17] <MajorLeeHung2> Christmas bonus for EA
[2022-12-20 20:19:19] <%+Fvley> packs shouldn't be 6pm 'content' regardless.
[2022-12-20 20:19:19] <xBeanhead> i missed everything can someone explain :)
[2022-12-20 20:19:27] <peydrow> lews gooooo
[2022-12-20 20:19:27] <+jamietwitch_> agree but they don't force you to buy the pack no?
[2022-12-20 20:19:27] <%+Kieran96cfc> and people will buy the pack AND do the sbc which makes EA think this is what we want
[2022-12-20 20:19:27] <+gamertagerror404> gonna cry?
[2022-12-20 20:19:27] <BradTheGeneral> Nani sbc coming ?
[2022-12-20 20:19:27] <+bigfut_> what can we do? we still play the game so they play us
[2022-12-20 20:19:27] <calsimpsoni> Ea at christmas:
[2022-12-20 20:19:30] BAN: gamertagerror404
[2022-12-20 20:19:32] <+ChineseDan> Also think WHY they didn't release the SBC 1st at 6pm and the pack at 7pm chat? Because they wouldn't make near as much money.
[2022-12-20 20:19:33] <philipjakobsson321> can I sharplay from ps4?
[2022-12-20 20:19:36] <+xiix_loki_xiix> Did we ever expect anything else from EA when this community is so desperate for content
[2022-12-20 20:19:36] <+Lujano916> They changed Argentina players dynamic pics of them kissing the World Cup
[2022-12-20 20:19:37] <Boony1997> Money money money grabbing rats
[2022-12-20 20:19:38] <dannyboy66551> This game is dead already. No content most days, gameplay unrealistic. I don‚Äôt have motivation to grind this game
[2022-12-20 20:19:38] <+weglobalfootball> The pack was untradeable and the SBC was cheaper and a better reward w a pick plus Phenoms and TOTT
[2022-12-20 20:19:40] <x5noopy> I need to stop spending money on this game
[2022-12-20 20:19:40] <%+OddSlice> it is shady practice from EA... but i will not complain at my Ben White that i just got finally

[2022-12-20 20:19:42] <+bigfut_> STOP BUYING FIFA POINTS
[2022-12-20 20:19:42] <+sealdawg> People have to be pretty stupid to do a pack they don‚Äôt want though surely
[2022-12-20 20:19:44] <%H0NKTV> perisic or carrasco in the WC pick? who would you go for?

[2022-12-20 20:20:29] <%+J98KE> I hope EA and fifa parting ways paves the way for a new football game.. they get away with this because theres zero competition
[2022-12-20 20:20:29] <wastedash> people like to learn new words and then just throw them around
[2022-12-20 20:20:31] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> @brokecollegefifa Absolute bullshit
[2022-12-20 20:20:34] <sudamericollin> its already a shame they make the packs untradeable imo, but this is just next level xD
[2022-12-20 20:20:35] <+Juckeeh> @BEANZLORD Just don't spend any money from this moment?
[2022-12-20 20:20:36] <Boony1997> Doing stuff like that ruins the game and turns the community away who have been playing for years
[2022-12-20 20:20:37] <+jd_ed1> swear some people are just fishing all the time, just come in the chat to cause beef
[2022-12-20 20:20:38] <+fastfil7> You got to be really naive to think Ea didn‚Äôt do this on purpose, chat

[2022-12-20 20:21:09] <+FinchyStryda> I wish EA would reach out to people like you, the people who talk sense and know what people want. It‚Äôs sad how this game is right now.

[2022-12-20 20:28:14] <bluenose1988> France euro 2000 and WC 98 team was too sick
[2022-12-20 20:28:15] <+iFearIess> it wasnt an average team

[2022-12-20 20:28:19] <%+TheRealClubhouse> no, but still far from average
[2022-12-20 20:28:19] <antisty> nobody said that was Frances best team. that doesn't make them bad
[2022-12-20 20:28:20] VIEWERS: 4¬†440
[2022-12-20 20:28:20] <+MrCatuh> was a very good team
[2022-12-20 20:28:21] <basedgod417_> France didn‚Äôt have most of their good players and got carried by mbappe
[2022-12-20 20:28:22] <bjornivara> not even the best keeper
[2022-12-20 20:28:23] <michaelmcallion73> not best but not close to average
[2022-12-20 20:28:24] <+callumalc7> I was okay
[2022-12-20 20:28:24] <matt100982> it wasn't Frances best team
[2022-12-20 20:28:26] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> France were average but also I think Argentina made them look incredible averafe for about 100 out of 120 minutes
[2022-12-20 20:28:29] <+MrCatuh> they were a stronger team than Argewntina
[2022-12-20 20:28:29] <$MrPeranz> Nah Konat√© should‚Äôve played
[2022-12-20 20:28:29] <+callumalc7> not their best though
[2022-12-20 20:28:29] <0wenwllls> it wasnt but argentina made them look awful for most of it
[2022-12-20 20:28:29] <+fastfil7> Lmao chat is crazy today
[2022-12-20 20:28:30] <$Amit_Alon> no but they played shit for 80 minutes
[2022-12-20 20:28:30] <xquasarx> Not Frances best team certainly not average though
[2022-12-20 20:28:30] <Phopper> no way in hell that was frances best team
[2022-12-20 20:28:34] <wastedash> It's a good team sure, but SO MANY INJURIES
[2022-12-20 20:28:34] <%Da_kapo> I got Grealish and giroud
[2022-12-20 20:28:37] <$marat0n__c0n> no chance it was
[2022-12-20 20:28:37] <%+pringle100> It certainly wasn‚Äôt an average France team though.
[2022-12-20 20:28:38] <+PlupertV2> France's best team that wasn't injured lol
[2022-12-20 20:28:38] <renz_uk> mandem think tchouameni clear of kante
[2022-12-20 20:28:39] <JaySsack> France had injuries to big players and then the flu ran through them
[2022-12-20 20:28:39] <TigerRTX> NOOOOOOOO stop reading idiots, that france team was only mbappe
[2022-12-20 20:28:39] <+lFantom> argentina wouldve had more passion than england
[2022-12-20 20:28:39] <+GansoGo> kante, benzema, kimpempe, nkunku missing
[2022-12-20 20:28:39] <danielqvs> Not their best eleven but still best squad mate üíÄüíÄüíÄüíÄüíÄ
[2022-12-20 20:28:40] <ruthlessslayer2> NGOLO POGBAA NKUNKU BENZEMA ..........
[2022-12-20 20:28:40] <%MooMoo177> ppl forgot 2018 pogba
[2022-12-20 20:28:41] <DavyeBee24> they missed kante and pogba massivley
[2022-12-20 20:28:41] <%+israelolivos> It isn‚Äôt France best but it‚Äôs above average
[2022-12-20 20:28:42] <+philipio1> It was mbappe v Argentina
[2022-12-20 20:28:43] <+RioMeahUK> You said Argentina made them look good. I dont think they looked good at all. Just a bit of genius by Mbappe
[2022-12-20 20:28:44] <renz_uk> n ppl forgetting benzema
[2022-12-20 20:28:45] <+Quaninh0> There is a reason why they wont last world cup and made it to this final?
[2022-12-20 20:28:46] <r6pengo> how konate didn't start idk
[2022-12-20 20:28:46] <jancey07> Pogba kante benzene unkunka all out
[2022-12-20 20:28:46] <$jose_1245> I got Mbappe I cant believe it
[2022-12-20 20:28:46] <steffenjo88> !psn
[2022-12-20 20:28:46] <@^Nightbot> NepentehZ
[2022-12-20 20:28:47] <mati_afc> They didnt even play their best CB Saliba FeelsBadMan
[2022-12-20 20:28:47] <ButlerBoyy_> theres only like 20k in it
[2022-12-20 20:28:52] <%+ray_rockwood> How is it Frances best team when Benzema was injured?!?!
[2022-12-20 20:28:55] <TigerRTX> Mbappe was literally the whole team
[2022-12-20 20:28:56] <@%Viperlization> yo
[2022-12-20 20:28:56] <%+rlewis94> Southgate will never win us anything unfortunately
[2022-12-20 20:28:57] <%MooMoo177> 2018 pogba was next level
[2022-12-20 20:28:59] <%+ray_rockwood> Also Nkunku!
[2022-12-20 20:28:59] <sBailey28> They didn‚Äôt even have the current balon d‚Äôor holder fit to start so clearly not their best team
[2022-12-20 20:29:00] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> They didnt have a shot until 70 minutes
[2022-12-20 20:29:01] <%+Johnnyv421> Henderson was very good this world cup
[2022-12-20 20:29:02] <%+paulmc93> Silly question but how do I invite to share play on PS4 chat?
[2022-12-20 20:29:02] <xquasarx> Argentina would beat england
[2022-12-20 20:29:04] <olsson1998> !psn
[2022-12-20 20:29:04] <@%Viperlization> did we get enouggh for a 81x11 video?
[2022-12-20 20:29:04] <+Makek83> if hes fodder price dosent matter so rating would be better
[2022-12-20 20:29:05] <%$istreet98> France first shot was the penalty
[2022-12-20 20:29:05] <$supahmarioo> That guy had a premier league back line Silva was probably better
[2022-12-20 20:29:06] <@%+Owen_Slater> Why are objectives bad? Why are rewards unrewarding? Cos ingame, you not in the store.  Why are league SBCs gone? Why is there no repeatable content? Because then you are in SBCs not the store.  And finally... objectives and repeatable SBCs gone, whats left is the single time SBCs. And this is now a strategy to take you to the store over them.  This isnt a single, one off thing, its just a part of the overall picture, which is horrific. Thats why its bad
[2022-12-20 20:29:07] <+fistyanan> @jose_1245 nice lie weirdo
[2022-12-20 20:29:08] <ruthlessslayer2> NGOLO POGBAA NKUNKU BENZEMA .........
[2022-12-20 20:29:10] <@%Viperlization> or going in with the other packs
[2022-12-20 20:29:10] <islander771231> ea i want messi....or else...
[2022-12-20 20:29:11] <+BloodBucketz> they literally had giroud over ballon d'or winner Benzema
[2022-12-20 20:29:11] <+PlupertV2> @ray_rockwood and Kante, and Lucas Hernandez, and Pogba...
[2022-12-20 20:29:14] <%+DirtyDishFC> USA drew England and probably were closer to winning. So while France was beatable by ENgland...its likely England dont win.
[2022-12-20 20:29:14] <+beansandchip> @riomeahuk where was the genius?! a pen and a shot that the keeper should've saved tbh
[2022-12-20 20:29:16] <%hughr1983> No kante either
[2022-12-20 20:29:17] <GHOSTIN313> without mbappe they had no weapon against argentina defense
[2022-12-20 20:29:22] <basedgod417_> That Argentina team was still good, France got cooked first half and in extra time
[2022-12-20 20:29:23] <ungalabugala2> What are you talking about?
[2022-12-20 20:29:28] <%+zoyebali> We made France look better, they did win it against us!
[2022-12-20 20:29:28] <zongorpista> argentina dominated the final, they just made a mistake  and conceeded 2 goals in 1 minute
[2022-12-20 20:29:28] <%cerrronnneeetfl> Wasn‚Äôt it the same team that played England?
[2022-12-20 20:29:28] <Bigchunk433> There‚Äôs no way Rabiot is in Frances best 11
[2022-12-20 20:29:32] <hiiitcvnj> That bang average team also beat England
[2022-12-20 20:29:36] <greenforestbear89> @owen_slater so true so disgusting from EA
[2022-12-20 20:29:37] <+Davidj595> England made France look amazing
[2022-12-20 20:29:39] <%+taylorallen133> Argentina were the better team over the whole 120
[2022-12-20 20:29:44] <mufcrashford123> @dirtydishfc that‚Äôs big waffle pal
[2022-12-20 20:29:44] <+llhashemll> @jose_1245 what pack?
[2022-12-20 20:29:45] <TigerRTX> that whole team was MBAPPE
[2022-12-20 20:29:46] <jamsekmiha> saka had theo on strings
[2022-12-20 20:29:48] <layton754> without mbappe they were done.
[2022-12-20 20:29:48] <%+kingnovakin> They had Pogba, Nkunku or Benz
[2022-12-20 20:29:49] <+halvalentine> Are we going to ignore the virus running thru French camp ?
[2022-12-20 20:29:49] <2M00N> statistically we should have beat france
[2022-12-20 20:29:52] <TigerRTX> it was rigged at the start
[2022-12-20 20:29:52] <+sceinz> its just mbappe things
[2022-12-20 20:29:52] <%+kingnovakin> no*
[2022-12-20 20:29:53] <shebanimoad> Argentina get influenced by pressure easily
[2022-12-20 20:29:53] <+ChineseDan> Subbed off Di Maria
[2022-12-20 20:29:57] <+mg_x_wolfy> tielemans or silva?
[2022-12-20 20:30:00] <+MrCatuh> France had one of the best squads in the competition and better than Argentina's but Argentina were the better team on the day
[2022-12-20 20:30:00] <+ChineseDan> YEP
[2022-12-20 20:30:00] <+sceinz> yep
[2022-12-20 20:30:00] <%+SamSurg3> the dude sent you the invitation ages ago
[2022-12-20 20:30:00] <mr_aaron300> Rabiot was one of the French best players loool
[2022-12-20 20:30:00] <Th1sSecretN1nj4> yup
[2022-12-20 20:30:02] <hussainwasiq09> France played for 20. mins only
[2022-12-20 20:30:03] <%+maxxx_007> both that and lack of fitness
[2022-12-20 20:30:05] <%+israelolivos> YES
[2022-12-20 20:30:05] <%danthewolvesfan> @tigerrtx explain
[2022-12-20 20:30:07] <%+derrickp_13> plus the amount of people france had injured
[2022-12-20 20:30:10] <+Lankyssj> Couldn't agree more
[2022-12-20 20:30:11] <supermercadotelebancos> @nepenthez did you see that Upamecano made the hand ball before the penalty that lead to 3-3
[2022-12-20 20:30:12] <%+maxxx_007> i would say france were the fitter team
[2022-12-20 20:30:13] <+mackam69> Benzema, Pogba, Nkunku, Kante, Maignan, Kimpembe all injured
[2022-12-20 20:30:14] <greenforestbear89> Argentina played more as a team with more cohesion and pride
[2022-12-20 20:30:15] <islander771231> the pen was very crucial..then i think argentina panicked
[2022-12-20 20:30:15] <0wenwllls> argentina would have beats us tbh, imagine maguire coping with their press
[2022-12-20 20:30:15] <hussainwasiq09> Martinez should've scored 1 atleast
[2022-12-20 20:30:15] <%+Johnnyv421> Nep if you‚Äôre gonna make a football podcast it‚Äôll be awesome
[2022-12-20 20:30:16] <+MoisMF> @tigerrtx oh please man.. have u actually watched
[2022-12-20 20:30:17] <r6pengo> acuna had a stinker onj the left
[2022-12-20 20:30:18] <Niceandfly> Di Maria was a menace at LW
[2022-12-20 20:30:20] VIEWERS: 4¬†517
[2022-12-20 20:30:22] <%+cooksteve88> absolutely Nep, di maria had kounde on toast
[2022-12-20 20:30:23] <%+michael2ooo> That kolo Muani changed the game I thought
[2022-12-20 20:30:23] <basedgod417_> England would just sit back against Argentina, it would have been a boring game
[2022-12-20 20:30:26] <+Lankyssj> A bit like when we took Saka off, totally changed the game
[2022-12-20 20:30:26] <ryan__donohue02> Mbappe was a ghost until he scored that first pen then he was unstoppable
[2022-12-20 20:30:28] <%+riff_hunter44> S
[2022-12-20 20:30:28] <ungalabugala2> France would‚Äôve literally beat everyone else except Argentina. No chance would England beat Argentina, Brazil or France
[2022-12-20 20:30:30] <+philipio1> Ad for e-football nice
[2022-12-20 20:30:32] <%tismad7> if you have two 86 players how do u fill in the 84 squad
[2022-12-20 20:30:32] <anisoss> Bro what?ü§£ü§£France had 0 shots until the 80th minute
[2022-12-20 20:30:34] <+cullenetz_16> Agreed
[2022-12-20 20:30:36] <zongorpista> they were soo nervous, and DiMaria sub was one of the biggest coaching mistakes at a wc
[2022-12-20 20:30:38] <+RioMeahUK> Regardless of the flawed point about the final I agree England wouldve beat Argentina
[2022-12-20 20:30:39] <+mp_1017> acuna was out of position
[2022-12-20 20:30:43] <yakuza977> LUL
[2022-12-20 20:30:44] <%+riff_hunter44> Argentina could easily of won in 90 mins
[2022-12-20 20:30:45] <layton754> Di maria made Kounde like he was nothing
[2022-12-20 20:30:47] <+sceinz> LUL
[2022-12-20 20:30:47] <%+QwadBhoy> You skipped me lol
[2022-12-20 20:30:48] <+Davidj595> Martinez was so bad should never had been subbed on
[2022-12-20 20:30:49] <islander771231> the think is that it was an amazing final
[2022-12-20 20:30:50] <here4rewards_> Yep
[2022-12-20 20:30:56] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> I think Argentina made France look average for 100 out of 120 minutes. But I also think thats because argentina are average as well. I actually dont think there was a single "great" side at this WV

[2022-12-20 20:42:33] <+placidjack> Your brain sees someone else yawn and thinks there's a lack of oxygen so it's a survival instinct

[2022-12-20 20:42:35] <$justbeingjames_> your brain probably looks at someone else yawning and maybe believes it also needs oxygen if someone else does
[2022-12-20 20:42:39] <%+bluenoserfc1> empathy is the reason

[2022-12-20 20:42:50] <jess___> You see someone else struggling for oxygen and your brain tells you that it‚Äôs coming for you next so preemptive yawn
[2022-12-20 20:42:51] <KapzeMcLovin> Man I really got lucky with my Asensio it seems
[2022-12-20 20:42:54] <%blazer33x> whats been the best pull?

[2022-12-20 20:42:57] <chrismdcd78> Contagious yawning may be a survival instinct, in that pack animals yawn to keep alert. So when 1 animal in the pack starts to get tired and yawns to stay alert, all the other animals in the pack do the same

[2022-12-20 21:02:24] <@%Viperlization> do you want me to add the 81x11's in the end
[2022-12-20 21:02:28] <Bret__> Do you feel that ever since they introduced swaps back in 2019 that they have overused it and utilized it incorrectly?
[2022-12-20 21:02:33] <soy_chema16> have you played the 90 games for rivals?
[2022-12-20 21:02:40] <+GeauxBeavs> I know nothing... Thiago Silva or Cavani?

[2022-12-20 21:03:06] <vikkstonker> What‚Äôs the reasoning behind the packweight being soooo bad? Wouldn‚Äôt it encourage more players to spend more time with the game if they get at the very least interesting player picks?
