[2023-01-09 17:58:30] <%CorndogN21> @kush06 they definitely have elite pieces aroudn him, so not saying I agree with the point completely because it wasn't all Stafford

[2023-01-09 17:59:31] <%+TanktopChad> @TanktopChad BIG time dude. Like Rosburg had the team averagine 27ppg and russ looked like a whole new qb. Really wished we would have gotten quinn last year. But I think harbaugh would be ideal, idk if it's worth trading a 1st round pick and more for Payton.

[2023-01-09 18:05:10] <%DaBeanieBaby> @mtroy50 good luck, if they trade the pick im guessing they drop lower to get multiple early picks to help WR and maybe DB
[2023-01-09 18:05:11] <EL__GRIEGO> Well it's kind of cool that it is more realistic than Warzone 1 with that TTK and movement, but it is just not that much fun

[2023-01-09 18:05:25] <jephrey802> @kush06 But I feel like WZ1 didn't have as much BR competition as there is now.  It's a battle of BRs, and whichever game is going to be the most accessible/fun is going to win.

[2023-01-09 20:43:59] <%+koolguykeith> And not only does it throw off the streaks. But like how do you even keep a consistent gameplay style. You‚Äôre either playing safe cause your going for wins, or playing safe cause your running from the stream snipers. We all love seeing the 20+ kill wins but this is just getting to be ridiculous.

[2023-01-09 20:57:49] <%itsPistoIPete> it turns red as soon as you enter the area and start killing the bots
[2023-01-09 20:57:49] <@%Hyperbeam__> @Ryku912 you have to wait for it to go all the way to 0 and then you have to kill some bots so you can get the loadout, you wont get the uav ping though
[2023-01-09 20:57:50] <%genothamean0> @Ryku912 from what i understand, it's red when someone is close enough to start the timer on bomb. doesnt necessarily mean someone is there. just means bomb can still be defused
