[2023-01-05 15:00:55] <vinarynkat> @rover_45 if your group is good you can lust the 1st pack and it'll most likely be back up for elemental boss
[2023-01-05 15:01:03] <+jet24twitch> wait you can see all the partie'S cooldowns like that?

[2023-01-05 15:20:21] <+gamerirl> @gamerirl Is Feral any good? I normally tank too, but I hear bears were good the first two weeks then got hit with the nerf stick. I also hear resto druid seems to be strong in raids and M+?
[2023-01-05 15:20:23] <%Sebleh> Also I love how she says “ME! Handle it!” when she orders her clones around.

[2023-01-05 15:21:01] <%Sebleh> @gamerirl you could do an offspec until you get 4PC because boomie is strong with 4set but you’ll be a bit behind on damage without.

[2023-01-05 15:37:45] <%+Mr_Espresso_Bean> also depends on the key level, if things don't live long enough you're not gonna do enough dmg. I definitely think orbital strike is better for lower keys in these situations

[2023-01-05 15:41:28] <@%^StreamElements> Limited range makes it feel like a melee, not a fan of charged spells. Not my thing.

[2023-01-05 15:41:48] <Significant7> @Naguura I am in a delima. I have to choose for the BiS Trinket or 4 set. Whats your opinion?

[2023-01-05 16:07:17] <+thor4love> What are your quick thoughts on the 10.0.5 talent revamp for boomies?  Mediocre? Bad? Insanely good?
[2023-01-05 16:07:23] <+Orcan3> anyone else turn off their damage numbers? I can concentrate so much more without BBoomer
[2023-01-05 16:07:25] <@%itsClubby> I think there is a talent boomies have that increases damage to a target with 3 dots on it but im no boomkin
[2023-01-05 16:07:36] <xBelgarx> !wago
[2023-01-05 16:07:36] <+Orcan3> If you want to do every bit of damage.. yes
[2023-01-05 16:07:57] <%Sebleh> I usually flare while the mushrooms dot ticks down
[2023-01-05 16:07:59] <@%itsClubby> not sure if they even run that talent anymore

[2023-01-05 16:08:54] <+BahumutGold> There's enough different paths in the trees that you rarely need to take a specific talent you'll never use to get to another one.

[2023-01-05 16:10:08] <%Sebleh> @lodekz in general boomie doesn’t work in low keys
[2023-01-05 16:10:14] <@%Kuroz> because details swaps both to overall at the end of the dungeon so everytime both go to current the next even if she had them current/overall
[2023-01-05 16:10:15] <%Tareah> @Venarra i think it's just a glitch . i think normally one is current and one is overall .. we are all human

[2023-01-05 16:25:56] <@%Kuroz> proximity pull by the paladin seems more likely
[2023-01-05 16:26:06] <@%itsClubby> what if it did LUL
[2023-01-05 16:26:08] <Panasonic82> Would the demon hunters Netherwalk be showing in the OmniCD if he isnt talenting it? That is not something you usually run
[2023-01-05 16:26:12] <+omes11> this is the one thing that make me upset. someone pulls and starfall takes the agro. but you still get blame
[2023-01-05 16:26:12] <DjUrsu> check the logs
[2023-01-05 16:26:16] <fishandkids> It only pulls when you don't want to pull. That's how Starfall works

[2023-01-05 19:11:15] <%Sebleh> Because you get one you have to use the other. You can get them back to back for opposing spells
[2023-01-05 19:11:20] <+thhanatos> U can get a proc out of a proc
[2023-01-05 19:11:25] <+Acalaysia> You can technically not have both, but when you use your starweaver proc for starfall you can get a starsurge proc.

[2023-01-05 19:12:06] <+Exitim> @Acalaysia you would miss a 2nd crafted item  .. so maybe overall less dps. Sim it for best information. I did it, and it was +/-0 but got 3rd craftet item .. overall + then

[2023-01-05 19:12:12] <%Sebleh> You can’t have both Naguura. It requires casting one to get a free of the other.

[2023-01-05 19:12:30] <%Sebleh> So if you have a free surge you can’t get a free fall without casting that free surge
[2023-01-05 19:12:30] <Nemesis_> cant have both free together they have to be one after the other

[2023-01-05 19:32:35] <@%Kuroz> duh
[2023-01-05 19:33:01] <%Sebleh> @thhanatos trinkets should also proc it
[2023-01-05 19:33:16] <+thhanatos> yes
[2023-01-05 19:33:22] <+thhanatos> thats why I mentioned skovold trinket
[2023-01-05 19:33:53] <%Sebleh> @ronannwow gotcha. With 4pc it should be the same thing as the guide, but you cast the free proc immediately when you enter eclipse.

[2023-01-05 20:50:00] <+katattakks> @xSEExSAWx the best recent advice I saw someone give a new player was to play each class until level 20 and see who you had more fun with/felt more comfortable with the most
[2023-01-05 20:50:06] <%Sebleh> @xseexsawx sadly the combat I think is the easiest thing to figure out? It’s mostly dodging things and what order to use abilities. The complicated part is navigating quests and the world. L

[2023-01-05 20:51:43] <MrAnzdy> You can have 1 guilds strategy as a baseline for your own guild but in the end you gotta make the fight your own
[2023-01-05 20:52:06] <%+xSEExSAWx> @katattakks oof ok, that is a good idea and actually thought about doing something similar, but that is a lot of time. I was thinking of waiting till I get 1 to 60 then trying a few others. I figured by character 3 I would assume I liked them more cuz I understood the game the best by then, ya know?

[2023-01-05 20:53:15] <%+xSEExSAWx> @Sebleh yeah, I am just mega used to fps games and my destiny raid team was like "lets play WoW" so here I am lol dodging and then weaving spells in is all good and dandy, but keep my focus is hard. I thought my league background would help. It really doesn't lol
[2023-01-05 20:53:18] <%+ZzapsIRL> thats why you swap 5 at a time every few hours
[2023-01-05 20:53:51] <+katattakks> @katattakks sometimes, I've rolled characters and didn't make it to 60 cause I either got bored or just couldn't understand lol. But always go with what's best for YOU.

[2023-01-05 21:02:32] <%Sebleh> Oh the boss

[2023-01-05 21:03:01] <%Sebleh> Yeah I kinda don’t like it even in heroic. My least favorite part is having to go to the platforms and interrupt but then I can’t do any damage before everything dies.
[2023-01-05 21:03:22] <taekwonyoshi> my take on this boss is "cool fight but not fun to play"
[2023-01-05 21:03:34] <%2000ish> you told them but they didn't listen naguuraPepeHands
[2023-01-05 21:03:36] <%Sebleh> Yeah I agreed with you. Targettable starfall with drift was better. The range was still massive.

[2023-01-05 21:04:10] <%Sebleh> And fuck it worst case you drop the aoe on yourself and dodge while casting at max range still a lower dps loss than moving around a lot.

[2023-01-05 21:05:11] <tutu5049> @taekwonyoshi i feel like the timing of the marks/tornado movement with the jump to the surounding platforms it's the most annoing thing
[2023-01-05 21:06:13] <tutu5049> depending on the dps on the adds, you either kill them too slow and the tornados are right in your face when you wanna jump, if u kill them too fast i guess nothing bad really happens xd
[2023-01-05 21:06:23] <altair19992> whole raid is "eh" as range KEKW

[2023-01-05 21:11:13] <%Sebleh> When I first started raiding again in Legion and early BFA that’s how it was - heroic focused and we’d just pug like 4-5 people to do the first boss in mythic. Eventually I just joined mythic focused guilds tho.

[2023-01-05 21:26:23] <+dsune_> yeah what i meant was if you want R3 guaranteed its really expensive since it requires so many mettles, hence why you craft R2 20k  free recraft your mats

[2023-01-05 21:26:28] <%+Mendez523> I usually let people tip me whatever for my Rank 3 epic gems. The mats are so expensive as is, imagine tipping 10k ontop for someone to push a button
[2023-01-05 21:26:29] <Uzzex> People need to understand that you are buying peoples time. Ive a top LW crafter myself, and i dident do it for the laughs. I put time into it to make gold, and ive mostly stopped doing crafts at this point, cus i can make much more just farming, and i dont have to deal with teaching people how crafting works, and then at the end be turned down, cus they think they can find cheaper crafts

[2023-01-05 21:29:35] <%Kahlandra> you cannot
[2023-01-05 21:29:39] <%Kahlandra> i went faceting
[2023-01-05 21:29:58] <%Anelit21> Its expensive because professions were sidekick for too long, the intense transition to professions actually being something created consequence of inflation.
[2023-01-05 21:30:09] <%+Gravit8_> I hear you naguura - which is why I can wait a bit for more JC specialists to skill up and price will go down for commission
[2023-01-05 21:30:15] <+vegitalander> So, did they make this raid easier?
[2023-01-05 21:30:20] <+vegitalander> or is this not mythic?
[2023-01-05 21:30:24] <manchesto_the_balloon_> 10k recraft. 8k only for nagura
[2023-01-05 21:30:34] <@%Kuroz> it's mythic
[2023-01-05 21:30:45] <+antibodies69> All crafters iv done are free recrafts so just look for that
[2023-01-05 21:30:57] <%Anelit21> Its like in 90s were people were saying PC-s are joke and they wont succeed as implementation in society
[2023-01-05 21:31:01] <taekwonyoshi> people should be able to do guaranteed max ranks by now, it's dumb that we have to rely on inspiration procs for almost everything

[2023-01-05 21:33:20] <Fharli> Another thing to consider is that due to people speccing for inspiration, a crafter can almost guarantee 2-3 recrafts by gearing or speccing poorly
[2023-01-05 21:33:25] <Fharli> and then charge for them
[2023-01-05 21:33:46] <+KaladinHS> is there a better way to find crafters than to spam trade chat?

[2023-01-05 21:34:38] <Rolaz> Maybe i am wrong, but if you are not a minmaxer just stay with t2, you will save a lot of money. With t3 the increase in dps is so low, that you will not notice it at all.

[2023-01-05 21:35:14] <+Crohnnn> @Anelit21 In this WOW economy KEKW!!?!?!??! but kinda understand now.
[2023-01-05 21:36:05] <%Anelit21> @Crohnnn thing is its NEW, its something that we were missing for a long time , so I am not saying that you should support it at all costs, but I think its good for the game in long term for it to be supported as system early on.
[2023-01-05 21:36:18] <%+Gravit8_> yeah, muy rationale for it is I have that neck and it's BIS, so who not totally maximize it out? I can go lower level and wait for a good JC to craft the top of the line one and I can wait a week or so
[2023-01-05 21:36:20] <taekwonyoshi> do we even unequip next patch? or do we just recraft it at a higher ilvl when that comes out NOTED
[2023-01-05 21:36:23] <Rolaz> maybe we can recraft lariant in next patch, and it will be BiS every time=)
[2023-01-05 21:36:29] <%+Gravit8_> *why not
[2023-01-05 21:37:04] VIEWERS: 1 428
[2023-01-05 21:37:06] <Dusquoes> but resourcefulness is lowering the price, if there are 100 crafters for 1 thing and the one who has resourcefulness thinks that in 10 crafts he gets the materials back once he can lower the price 10%
[2023-01-05 21:37:26] <%+Gravit8_> I like that three gems can all have separate procs that can overlap, but the same procs don't overlap.
[2023-01-05 21:37:29] <Dusquoes> then the others wont sell their things and also have to lower their price
