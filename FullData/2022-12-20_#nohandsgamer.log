[2022-12-20 00:36:14] <meteospasmyl> why not add quest ?

[2022-12-20 00:36:23] <@^Nightbot> I took a vow to never play quest priest because it's too OP and immoral. Sorry. You can play it, but you're a bad person if you do.

[2022-12-20 00:43:38] <Wombat_inCombat> ill jsut wait for the mini set and see what happens then, enjoying dk so far.
[2022-12-20 00:43:45] <%rexmkh> the obliterate buff should be pretty pog for blood. i wonder if more decks will start running it now

[2022-12-20 00:43:56] <Wombat_inCombat> also i got alot of hunter cards so ill might be looking into that, i just cant seem to enjoy beast hunter at all
[2022-12-20 00:44:03] <%carolineluin> hey, @NoHandsGamer are you ok? where is our DK?
[2022-12-20 00:44:03] <ShellBasher1> @Wombat_inCombat Yea np, good idea. Rotation is soon so theres no rush really

[2022-12-20 00:50:15] <JJJ67> this looks like 10 mana to me
[2022-12-20 00:50:20] <ShellBasher1> It seemed that the benefits of Renathal were so much outweighing the negatives

[2022-12-20 00:50:42] <KungCheops> Apart from renathal nerf the changes looked pretty nice but idk
[2022-12-20 00:50:50] <+DMRhythm> Is DR Rogue playable anymore? I literally just crafted it 2 days ago lol
[2022-12-20 00:50:57] <ioreign1> Is it even possible to play location/draka rogue at this point?
[2022-12-20 00:50:57] <KungCheops> Maybe I just hate rogue
[2022-12-20 00:50:57] VIEWERS: 159
[2022-12-20 00:50:59] <%rexmkh> tbh, I'm glad that dr rogue is dead. That deck just seemed way too high rolly
[2022-12-20 00:51:01] <ShellBasher1> Rogue got taken to the back alley and beat across the head
[2022-12-20 00:51:02] <Bilwitz> Thief rogue is going to be meta for over a month. Not happy with that
[2022-12-20 00:51:02] <PaladinIRL> Nohands how does your chat have so many seasoned professional game devs BatChest
[2022-12-20 00:51:41] <Bilwitz> because they don't know what they're doing?
[2022-12-20 00:51:45] <%rexmkh> i was surprised that they killed off all the good rogue cards. I thought that that they target just one rogue archetype
[2022-12-20 00:51:54] <%+Antonbrehbrahbruh> for ppl to buy packs then nerf LUL
[2022-12-20 00:51:56] <%rexmkh> would target*
[2022-12-20 00:52:01] <JJJ67> the 2 drop nerf is really weird, I agree with sketchy nerf though
[2022-12-20 00:52:02] <+Ozryel626> Gotta use up that Dust somehow
[2022-12-20 00:52:03] <+haydn_290> dr rogue was playable for 1 patch
[2022-12-20 00:52:08] <Hipokeimenon> this was just dust for Christmas
[2022-12-20 00:52:20] <%rexmkh> norwis said theif rogue should be t1 now

[2022-12-20 00:52:53] <ShellBasher1> The positives of Renathal were WAAAY outweighing the negatives
[2022-12-20 00:52:55] <meteospasmyl> they print them so people buy packs, then nerf them so people keep playing
[2022-12-20 00:52:57] VIEWERS: 247
[2022-12-20 00:53:05] <JJJ67> Well it's the reddit echo chamber, other opinions get downvoted to hell
[2022-12-20 00:53:28] <+BoltharHS> Reqvam said Renethal was the strongest card in Hearthstone's history behind 2-mana Illucia
[2022-12-20 00:53:32] <Cnoko> boon to 5 mana is the biggest loser
[2022-12-20 00:53:33] <zeroxhaust> a lot of these changes were predicted by VS
[2022-12-20 00:53:34] <+haydn_290> do you think renathal bc they were afraid games could be too long?
[2022-12-20 00:53:36] <%rexmkh> the nerf gun lobby owns reddit
[2022-12-20 00:53:40] <s3rgihs> looks like reddit people dont even play hearthstone
[2022-12-20 00:53:52] <+phrasinghs> Nohands you’re in Chicagoland right? Looks like we’re about to get blasted
[2022-12-20 00:54:08] <%Penguin_Edd> just finished watching your vid (great vid btw), and I basically agree. kinda sad that the idea behind the renthal nerf was unholy dk because I enjoying playing bad dk decks. so sad about the renthal nerf

[2022-12-20 00:55:18] <%rexmkh> nowis thinks that quest dh is still t1 despite the nerfs
[2022-12-20 00:55:24] <starhunterone> They buffed terrible cards and the buffs are terrible LUL

[2022-12-20 00:55:40] <%Penguin_Edd> It did feel a bit overkill with rogue
[2022-12-20 00:55:49] <%rotemv3> Weird
[2022-12-20 00:55:57] <ShellBasher1> DR rogue was cool but they didnt have to absolutely murder it
[2022-12-20 00:56:23] <%rexmkh> they need to bring in somebody new for warrior
[2022-12-20 00:56:29] <+BoltharHS> It just ends up being good discovers for Rogue
[2022-12-20 00:56:33] <starhunterone> They want DR Rogue to be a meme deck, not a meta deck
[2022-12-20 00:56:35] <+helix_sky> why even print warrior cards when they are so bad
[2022-12-20 00:56:39] <starhunterone> That's how it has always been

[2022-12-20 00:56:48] <patrikk808> why do they even print cards, most of them will be unplayable FailFish

[2022-12-20 00:57:12] <Kallenger> depth should be 3 mana again
[2022-12-20 00:57:13] <%rexmkh> warrior wasn't invited to the blizz christmas party :(
[2022-12-20 00:57:21] <acidc0w> why do we even exist?
[2022-12-20 00:57:22] <+crazyoldjay> they forgot warrior exists
[2022-12-20 00:57:27] <%Penguin_Edd> they did say they would make "spicier" changes in the next patch, their reasoning being lack of data rn
[2022-12-20 00:57:36] <OurYoungHero> They should just give Warrior a 1 mana 5/2 weapon, death rattle: goes back to hand. Something small and simple to give them a little boost.
[2022-12-20 00:57:43] <+helix_sky> warrior: to be or not be...
[2022-12-20 00:57:44] <khuchten> Warrior should be Hall of Fame and only playable in classic, pointless class
[2022-12-20 00:57:45] <meteospasmyl> meati got 50% wr with warrior, so no buffs
[2022-12-20 00:57:50] <ioreign1> Did we do full circle back to last expansion's beast hunter being the top meta deck again?
[2022-12-20 00:57:55] <Kallenger> warrior is a sleeping class since june
[2022-12-20 00:58:17] <%rexmkh> @meteospasmyl was he running any new cards in his deck besides maybe astalor?

[2022-12-20 00:59:33] <JJJ67> Last expansion Spooky Mage + Astalor is probably fine
[2022-12-20 00:59:34] <%rexmkh> @Royseprime quest dh is still good, but it's a little slower and more vulnerable to aggro now

[2022-12-20 01:08:38] <dendaihs> druid is better but feels bad against hunter
[2022-12-20 01:08:42] <OurYoungHero> They should just let all classes have 20 mana and Guff could do like 40 or something so we can all do big combos

[2022-12-20 01:09:02] <%+soccernerd22> with rena life only going to 35 the anub nerf isnt enough to completely shut down the druid otk

[2022-12-20 02:00:28] <%$Cadian_9th> I do like how they didn’t just make the body worse. Like they could have made it a 5 mana 3/4 or something

[2022-12-20 02:02:03] <88Architects> they did good in battlegrounds nerfs. the problem was the cards they re introduced
[2022-12-20 02:02:03] <@%lass_leah> they keep printing these stupid insanely powerful Rogue cards and people wonder why Rogue is always nerfesd
[2022-12-20 02:02:21] <+BrodieTK> What’s a warrior?
[2022-12-20 02:02:22] <%breakfast_boi21> They found the evil alternate universe versions of the rogue team to do the rogue nerfs.
[2022-12-20 02:02:34] <Bilwitz> thief rogue is going to be tier 1 so it will get more nerfs a week after the mini set
[2022-12-20 02:02:36] <yoimkou> hey whats a good deck to craft for this season?!
[2022-12-20 02:02:51] <%+Rennman8> Its also funny that deathrattle rogue was pushed for so long and now the first week it’s good it got nerfed
[2022-12-20 02:02:51] <+YoHablo_Espanol> is plague spreader really at threat of being nerfed?

[2022-12-20 02:03:38] <+DrEvil69I> if a card is played, it might see nerfs - wisdom of the week Kappa

[2022-12-20 02:03:59] <%rexmkh> northshire footman still gets played in low ranks. I guess that it's at risk of being nerfed Kappa

[2022-12-20 03:05:02] <+Lunarb00mer> More mana does not matter for a Druid with 20 mana
[2022-12-20 03:05:02] <Amyviel> @lvl_100_magikarp just have to play brann and astalor before you play anub
[2022-12-20 03:05:05] <+joblessleo1861> @nohandsgamer come salsa in nyc for christmas!
[2022-12-20 03:05:06] <bizjeet5> it is pretty consistent cause they just run the 30 card jarla list now, you need to disrupt

[2022-12-20 03:19:38] <SpykoNukov> I liked the infinite ghoul board DR Rogue could make, would just wish it would've been it's main wincon and required more mana and set up
[2022-12-20 03:19:38] <ThisSilhouetteLie> yeah dh rogue was fine, bronze redditors killed it
[2022-12-20 03:19:40] <%+GuildChatter> DR Rogue got really popular when the websites showed it as being the #1 deck to legend.  Then, we're constantly playing against DR rogues.
[2022-12-20 03:19:56] <+luciogabrielx> DR was lotta fun and wasn't broken in legend, but most ppl don't even hit diamond, so to them de deck was kinda unfair imo
[2022-12-20 03:20:02] <fly1ngcat> @shanevapid theres also that 4 mana 2/5 card they created then nuked
[2022-12-20 03:20:07] <OurYoungHero> I think the best way to stop these stupid OP combo decks would be to lower all starting health to 1.
[2022-12-20 03:20:16] <gravitas3k> i never played DR rogue but I thought it was fine. At least it was unique and rogue-y

[2022-12-20 03:50:09] <SpykoNukov> @rexmkh how is the implock and aggro druid MU now ? I play spell and aggro drood is doable but implock feel impossible
[2022-12-20 03:50:13] <%rexmkh> that 5 health definitely lost me some games vs dk beforehand
[2022-12-20 03:50:26] <bizjeet5> @rexmkh yea the nerfs were good for my infinite svalna priest as well except the valishj nerf stings slightly
[2022-12-20 03:50:58] <bizjeet5> I can kill from 30 for free, 40 is harder but usually doable, and 50 is unlikely

[2022-12-20 04:06:48] <brockmalkmus> the 1 mana card "nerf" prob only matters vs aggro druid. 99% of the time won't matter

[2022-12-20 04:23:40] <VineetTogani> @nohandsgamer is druid dead now?
[2022-12-20 04:23:48] <NORGAMKA> Thats not gonna help Unholy literally has noway to leverage their board
[2022-12-20 04:23:59] <NORGAMKA> All Corpse spenders and Corpse generators are bad
[2022-12-20 04:24:16] <Sevee7nn> @NoHandsGamer 5 of life justifies using renatal yet? despite the 10 extra cards
[2022-12-20 04:24:25] <lightfreeze_hs> @FlyingPuncake oh damn, that's a shame
[2022-12-20 04:24:30] <%+shanevapid> People were comparing it to totem golem lol
[2022-12-20 04:24:55] <NORGAMKA> Totem Golem wouldnt see play now days is the funny thing
[2022-12-20 04:25:07] <+jewelsftw> It’s good but you basically need to have bodybagger on 1

[2022-12-20 04:25:30] <NORGAMKA> I wished they move Graveyard Shift to 2 mana
[2022-12-20 04:25:31] <JJJ67> the 3 mana for 2 reborn 1/1s is so weak
[2022-12-20 04:25:35] <NORGAMKA> that would have helped there early game
[2022-12-20 04:25:54] <%4910bob> Is Warrior busted
[2022-12-20 04:26:23] <NORGAMKA> To me Unholy looks like a subclass that the devs were too scared of and heavily nerfed it in testing
[2022-12-20 04:26:33] [Points] VineetTogani redeemed Answer questions (3 000) [Is Druid dead now? If not, please suggest a deck, aggro Druid?]
[2022-12-20 04:26:42] <%rotemv3> I mean they made a lot of content this expansion
[2022-12-20 04:26:48] <%rotemv3> Takes time
[2022-12-20 04:26:53] <KaK_HS> the combo still works :(

[2022-12-20 04:27:09] <+datfrogger> druid might actually be better than before
[2022-12-20 04:27:11] <%4910bob> only been 2 weeks

[2022-12-20 04:27:18] <+jewelsftw> How does the combo work now?
[2022-12-20 04:27:21] <%JonsyBones> Druid isn't dead. But should be. Guff needs to be left in the gutter. Thoughts?

[2022-12-20 04:27:40] <NORGAMKA> My main problem with Unholy is what does this Rune do better than other classes?
[2022-12-20 04:27:46] <NORGAMKA> nothing
[2022-12-20 04:27:47] <+datfrogger> @jewelsftw play 2 mana astalor the turn before then u go brann anubarak 5 mana astalor and two 8 mana ones
[2022-12-20 04:28:14] <%+shanevapid> I don’t think he will be able to otk
[2022-12-20 04:28:20] <+kmartsceo> where is cult neophyte Kappa
[2022-12-20 04:28:50] <+jewelsftw> @datfrogger But you can’t play 4 8 mana astalors anymore Sadge Kappa
[2022-12-20 04:28:51] <%+YouGotCut> This is kind of perfect - I'm considering trying both of these decks

[2022-12-20 04:31:28] <+jewelsftw> Warrior didn’t get a single buff, right? KEKW
[2022-12-20 04:31:50] <+WarWalrus88> Arena in shambles
[2022-12-20 04:32:01] <JJJ67> Think only DK and Warrior really needed buffs
[2022-12-20 04:32:14] <NORGAMKA> I hope next patch they do another set of buffs because I think Warrior and Shaman may need it just for gameplay value
[2022-12-20 04:32:26] <@%lass_leah> I'd also like Hunter buffs
[2022-12-20 04:32:52] <@%lass_leah> buff the new mage cards too
[2022-12-20 04:33:09] <!%pocket_train> Make Mozaki 4 mana and apprentice not just arcane spells
[2022-12-20 04:33:19] <NORGAMKA> its kinda sad how this expansion is just making me look foward to next years rotation

[2022-12-20 04:39:26] <whenifapicri> should have made the nerf another 5 less hp but hit the deck size as well, maybe down by 10
[2022-12-20 04:39:40] <!%pocket_train> Make you start with 5 cards and starting health 50

[2022-12-20 05:14:30] <caybellHS> i agree with renathal in core, we cant just always appease the pooping gamers out there thoughts?
[2022-12-20 05:14:42] <ColonelBlabby> why are we so low monkaS renathal save us monkaS
[2022-12-20 05:14:48] <ElvenAcademy> maybe they nerf now to less blatantly open design space for next ex pack

[2022-12-20 05:15:54] <TheAtheistGod> @lass_leah releasing a new class at the end of a standard format doesnt make sense
[2022-12-20 05:15:57] <chromat1> +7 life?
[2022-12-20 05:16:00] <%starwarz1> it's not like aggro was unbeatable before renathal was printed.
[2022-12-20 05:16:01] <Yo_NiK> whats the point of getting 5 extra hp just to add 9 cards in deck
[2022-12-20 05:16:15] <TheAtheistGod> either DK will be underpowered on release or it will be overpowered on rotation when everyone else loses a bunch of stuff
[2022-12-20 05:16:21] <@%lass_leah> @TheAtheistGod I wouldn't disagree
[2022-12-20 05:16:37] <%+shanevapid> Worlds was irrefutable proof that dk was a complete failure. Not a single one. They even added a rule saying you couldn’t ban dk because they were so terrified people wouldn’t get to see high level dk gameplay. OMEGALUL
[2022-12-20 05:16:48] <Yo_NiK> @theatheistgod exactly
[2022-12-20 05:17:04] <!%pocket_train> not being able to ban dk reduced the chances anyone would bring it

[2022-12-20 05:17:09] <@%lass_leah> I told the "no DK at worlds" story to a few lapsed HS players and they all got a good laugh at it

[2022-12-20 06:21:00] <+tribunal12a> @mightyergoTV i played against an undead aggro deck that got a big corpse bride so thats cool
[2022-12-20 06:21:11] <+Knives_Out> Meat Grinder is a must craft. It will be in every deck, even non DK ones
[2022-12-20 06:21:25] <%+yodacao> meat grinder isnt worth the craft
[2022-12-20 06:21:26] <부랭중다앵 (redsox0009)> ㅠ_ㅠ
[2022-12-20 06:21:30] <+tribunal12a> the obliterate buff is HUGE tho, the card is fully playable now and is incredibly good removal
[2022-12-20 06:21:42] <+TheBerryMan0> Does he lose the other 5 drop if we whirlpool there?
[2022-12-20 06:21:45] <NORGAMKA> Yeah they def overestimated Corpses power level
[2022-12-20 06:21:45] <%+yodacao> i rather have the mount in WoW than craft it

[2022-12-20 06:22:18] <NORGAMKA> Corpse spenders should be Vanilla baseline with upside, like Corpse Bride a 5/5 the Bonedigger a 2/3
[2022-12-20 06:22:18] <+tribunal12a> honestly obliterate really helps blood dk overall, you just have more removal that goes through divine shield too
[2022-12-20 06:22:54] <NORGAMKA> Obliterate is now really good at removing Druids 23/23 Devourers
[2022-12-20 06:23:35] <+tribunal12a> @NORGAMKA honestly it may be the best removal in the game
[2022-12-20 06:23:39] <+tribunal12a> without thinking about it at all
[2022-12-20 06:23:40] <NORGAMKA> I have a theory they're nervous about Buffs because they dont want DK to be OP at the start of next rotation
[2022-12-20 06:23:41] <mightyergoTV> DK just need some more actual powerful corpse pay off cards. It's impossible to go all in with corpse rushing atm
[2022-12-20 06:23:46] <saddochi> Glory is currently playing dk without obliterate

[2022-12-20 06:23:57] <marveleternalsofficial> @NORGAMKA Disagree on corpse bride. I like buffing the other body more than buffing the bride herself
[2022-12-20 06:24:01] <NORGAMKA> @NORGAMKA best single target for sure altho Priest The Light it Burns may beat it

[2022-12-20 06:24:38] <NORGAMKA> @NORGAMKA Yeah maybe give it Taunt or Rush or something but I think the problem honestly is card text space
[2022-12-20 06:25:13] <+tribunal12a> @NORGAMKA oh yeah idk how i forgot about that card, that probably is better

[2022-12-20 06:26:22] <marveleternalsofficial> but for control priest 40 cards is important if you're not running quest
[2022-12-20 06:26:45] <mightyergoTV> the 40 card deck is also upside for control. Was a baby nerf if anything for renethal
[2022-12-20 06:26:47] <부랭중다앵 (redsox0009)> aggro little bit relatively buffed
[2022-12-20 06:27:00] <NORGAMKA> I think Renethal now is a card where the 10 extra cards is the upside

[2022-12-20 06:54:44] <%RattlegoreLMBO> remember when warrior was the best class by a narrow margin (and had plenty of counters) and then they nerfed 8 cards in the deck
[2022-12-20 06:54:47] <+datfrogger> nerf everything until dk is best KEKW
[2022-12-20 06:54:59] <NORGAMKA> nothing rn stands out as a nerf target honestly
[2022-12-20 06:55:01] <%+yodacao> priest mirror hype
[2022-12-20 06:55:03] <marveleternalsofficial> @Big_boy787 midrange decks benefitted more because they could survive aggro without having to run sustain
[2022-12-20 06:55:11] <Bilwitz> Every class but shaman and warrior would need a nerf then
[2022-12-20 06:55:12] <+datfrogger> maybe its infinite priest
[2022-12-20 06:55:15] <RBY7> then people complain that dl is op.. nerf dk KEKW
[2022-12-20 06:55:16] <%randomer22> eventually they'll realize that all the problematic decks come from nohandsgamer and just nerf him EZ
[2022-12-20 06:55:28] <%+Xeath5> druid completley deletets every kind of dk
[2022-12-20 06:55:46] <+Big_boy787> Facts @marveleternalsofficial but so midrange decks would run renathal so they basically were double dipping

[2022-12-20 06:56:24] <marveleternalsofficial> thief rogue and beast hunter were helped so much by renethal
[2022-12-20 06:56:30] <+Big_boy787> I also feel like Druid is still strong af and they need to nerf it more somehow lol
[2022-12-20 06:56:41] <marveleternalsofficial> Druid was tier 3 before the nerf
[2022-12-20 06:56:42] <NORGAMKA> i honestly wish scales of onyxia gets nerfed a tad
[2022-12-20 06:56:44] <Bilwitz> also ridiculous they nerfed Sire when Astalor is basically him but better
[2022-12-20 06:56:48] <%RattlegoreLMBO> Druid was tier 3
[2022-12-20 06:56:56] <%randomer22> is this person playing nerfed boon priest?
[2022-12-20 06:56:58] <skofguldan> druid is so bad vs any aggro though
[2022-12-20 06:57:07] <Bilwitz> atleast Sire required minions to infuse. Every class is running astalore now
[2022-12-20 06:57:09] <ChungKring> druid so slow
[2022-12-20 06:57:10] <%+Xeath5> sire nerf was just cuz he was bored
[2022-12-20 06:57:10] <marveleternalsofficial> druid also got nerfed by the renethal nerf
[2022-12-20 06:57:14] <LeonGaltran> Imp/curse on top now BrokeBack
[2022-12-20 06:57:25] <%+Xeath5> like the player when playing him Kappa

[2022-12-20 06:57:31] <RBY7> I got so much dust that idk what to do with it KEKW
[2022-12-20 06:57:32] <%Kinchmind> i don't think scale of onyxia is too op, but the fact that they have it EVERY time is op
[2022-12-20 06:57:45] <marveleternalsofficial> sire nerf was completely unnecessary from a balance perspective

[2022-12-20 06:57:49] <+Big_boy787> I still feel like Druid is strong but maybe I’m just bad lmaooo
[2022-12-20 06:57:52] <Bilwitz> is this going to be sister apm

[2022-12-20 06:58:17] <%+Xeath5> nobody said druid isnt strong
[2022-12-20 06:58:27] <ChungKring> druid strong in late game
[2022-12-20 06:58:28] <+Big_boy787> Imo sire should’ve been a dk card and left it how it was and then blood dk would have that as a win condition
[2022-12-20 06:58:29] <%RattlegoreLMBO> I did @xeath5  fight me
[2022-12-20 06:58:38] <z_whitte> doesnt matter cutting ruins when the opponent pops off on whirlpool angle
[2022-12-20 06:58:42] <marveleternalsofficial> druid play patterns are annoying. the consistency of drawing ramp early is crazy. However, it might be better than the old days when druid had absurdly differing winrates based on drawing wild growth or not
[2022-12-20 06:59:03] <warbrut> @Big_boy787 now you can use 30 cards druid version. And its even stronger but you need to find guf fo sure
[2022-12-20 06:59:18] <%+Xeath5> @RattlegoreLMBO why would you talk like a crazy person? KEKW ofc druid is strong
[2022-12-20 06:59:26] <+Big_boy787> I mean guf is always what makes that deck pop off
[2022-12-20 06:59:29] <Bilwitz> Ramp limits design space and makes druid a 1 dimensional class
[2022-12-20 06:59:38] <+Big_boy787> Just being able to go all the way to 20 mama is just too strong imo
[2022-12-20 06:59:53] <Bilwitz> which is why druid breaks the game everytime a strong neutral is out
[2022-12-20 06:59:56] <hskookdoug> big dick guff
[2022-12-20 06:59:56] <%+yodacao> get wrekt fail priest
[2022-12-20 07:00:03] <warbrut> @Big_boy787 before nerf you can kill op without guf
[2022-12-20 07:00:15] VIEWERS: 934
[2022-12-20 07:00:20] <skofguldan> if druid gets guff and goes to 20 druid is op. But ramp is so bad vs aggro and stuff like pure paladin
[2022-12-20 07:00:22] <warbrut> now you cant
[2022-12-20 07:00:38] <WishingPoo> Currently 69% win rate with my mage deck.  Optimal

[2022-12-20 07:05:35] <+Big_boy787> I mean I guess but that’s how Card games are tho, you make a deck with a win condition and other minor win conditions and then you play to set them up.
[2022-12-20 07:06:09] <+Big_boy787> I do agree that most hero cards are op but that doesn’t mean it’s not balanced right? 🤣

[2022-12-20 07:09:44] <unknlai> win condition is to make your opponent die bcs he has no hp. qctually I dont know what you mean by" set up a win condition".   only otk decks need a specific win condition in the past
[2022-12-20 07:10:19] <ViewDeath> @Xeath5 is it easy to get bots to build channel, and if yes, why aren't more doing the same and why stop @ the 100 or so viewers the channel has?

[2022-12-20 07:11:04] <+Big_boy787> What I mean is, you play cards and keep trying to bring down your opponent until you get that one card that’s gonna get you the victory aka win condition
[2022-12-20 07:11:22] <%randomer22> because you're a nice person and you want their cards to cost their normal amount :)

[2022-12-20 07:18:12] <eveningcoffee_> The only real money is advertising for twitter and you don't want to advertise on platform that cozies to neo nazies.

[2022-12-20 07:18:47] <%RattlegoreLMBO> mark zuckerberg was an effective executive up until Meta. evil yes, but not a bozo the 🤡
[2022-12-20 07:18:49] <kidblue57> howdy
[2022-12-20 07:18:50] <+Valistin14> Everyone just slackers compared to elon musk tbh
[2022-12-20 07:18:55] <+Valistin14> His work ethic is insane
[2022-12-20 07:19:13] <%+geezlix> Exactly. What he "tried" to enforce at Twitter completely backfired on him. Now he's stuck with a company to "manage" and that's not his gig
[2022-12-20 07:19:13] <ViewDeath> its also hard to inspire employees when at this point your entire shtick exists on Twitter for them to form an opinion about him before they even meet
[2022-12-20 07:19:13] <EarthStone> At least that ex-twitter employee is in jail now for selling people personal info
[2022-12-20 07:19:16] <%JonsyBones> This whole twitter thing exposed what a clown elon really is. Turns out he just had a really good PR team
[2022-12-20 07:19:17] <androidrevolution> thats because he got lost in the sauce and surrounded himself in an echochamber of sycophants who just fondled elons ego
[2022-12-20 07:19:18] <Valioes> How has fel DH seemed after nerds? @nohandsgamer
[2022-12-20 07:19:41] <%berkiee> everyone in chat is an expert on musk and companies its hilarious
[2022-12-20 07:20:03] <%+PineappleTrainWreck> people dont have a clue how many people starve literally do death for elon musk to have billions of dollars. simps online actually defend this monster
[2022-12-20 07:20:05] <%JonsyBones> Imagine defending a billionaire and not even getting paid for it KEKW
[2022-12-20 07:20:07] <%+geezlix> What he "tried" to enforce at Twitter completely backfired on him. Now he's stuck with a company to "manage" and that's not his gig
[2022-12-20 07:20:09] <+charlesdotwin> I follow one of the top tech/silicon valley journalists (Kara Swisher) and a leading theory is that he tanked Twitter value so much that it triggered a clause in the loan forcing him to sell off some Tesla stock which is tanking Tesla, so Tesla board gave him a come-to-Jesus talk telling him to get it together and hand control over to someone else,  so now he'll prob step down and those stupid polls/etc is just cover to save face.

[2022-12-20 07:21:02] <EarthStone> Is he selling the company or just making someone else ceo?
[2022-12-20 07:21:06] <%+Parabellvm420> @charlesdotwin i dont buy that for a sec
[2022-12-20 07:21:07] <%RattlegoreLMBO> you have opinions? who are you to have opinions. I sit here with no opinions
[2022-12-20 07:21:09] <%JonsyBones> He's already lost a ton. No longer the richest person in the world. Truly a genius
[2022-12-20 07:21:22] <%huntstv> that's because he was never good at business or innovation, he bought his way into companies that existed and then used money and PR teams to pretend like he made those companies
[2022-12-20 07:21:23] <%+Xeath5> i dont understand that people are suprised hes not gonna stay ceo
[2022-12-20 07:21:27] <%+Xeath5> he said that like 3 months ago

[2022-12-20 07:21:42] <%berkiee> just how much attention billionaires gets is a real canary for how sick our society is
[2022-12-20 07:21:45] <%+PineappleTrainWreck> if you dont have an opinion on billionaires then you're hurting the exploited by letting it continue
[2022-12-20 07:21:54] <%huntstv> he didn't even start tesla, he bought his way into it when it was already a company and had all its patents
[2022-12-20 07:21:55] <chrisccd2018> who cares VeryBased
[2022-12-20 07:21:58] <%JonsyBones> People just need to stop simping for the wealthy. They will never care about you. You're just useful idiots to them.

[2022-12-20 07:23:41] <%+PineappleTrainWreck> the frontier of freedom of speech is JOURNALISM lmfao
[2022-12-20 07:23:59] <Carthradge4> he banned a lot of leftists accounts who had never been suspended before or broken any rules because white nationalists told him to do so
[2022-12-20 07:24:06] <unknlai> I am only curious about when will he put some IC chip things in his brain. LUL
[2022-12-20 07:24:08] <%+Xeath5> didnt he just ban some guys leaking live location of people?

[2022-12-20 07:24:54] <%+synnebane> for some, concerns about free speech aren't about speech being controlled but rather they aren't the ones controlling it.
[2022-12-20 07:25:27] <%+PineappleTrainWreck> i will be so happy if twitter falls apart. we need myspace to make a comeback :)

[2022-12-20 07:25:32] <%RattlegoreLMBO> I think we will need to get chat off this subject asap. no way will anything else be discussed tonight. too many strong opinions lmbo
[2022-12-20 07:26:01] <%JonsyBones> @RattlegoreLMBO Sure. As long as we agree that we don't owe allegiance to ultra-wealthy egomaniacs
[2022-12-20 07:26:10] <Carthradge4> @PineappleTrainWreck he also banned legit orgs like CrimethInc which are not cia ops.

[2022-12-20 07:42:57] <zurfilo> Couldnt you just slot quest into this deck and it'd work? Taking a look at the list it seems very similar

[2022-12-20 07:43:12] <@^Nightbot> I took a vow to never play quest priest because it's too OP and immoral. Sorry. You can play it, but you're a bad person if you do.

[2022-12-20 23:34:47] <%sirsquilliam_tentpoles> I say put renethal is core set and revert the nerf
[2022-12-20 23:34:49] <%matmarex> i've been winning with gigachad paladin today and i am concerned about the state of the game if that deck is good

[2022-12-20 23:35:27] <minerwator> my problem with dk is that mechanics are kinda meh
[2022-12-20 23:35:29] <meltingnt> dh doesn't otk you it deals like 20 before jace comes down KEKW
[2022-12-20 23:35:30] <astroworldhs> any wins yet?
[2022-12-20 23:35:32] <minerwator> corpses arent really fun
[2022-12-20 23:35:54] <SadLH> so.. what is our play for turn 5?

[2022-12-20 23:36:01] <@^Nightbot> Check out my thoughts on the nerfs https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67bpoQ04hvU&ab_channel=NohandsGamerBlizzard article here:https://hearthstone.blizzard.com/en-us/news/23892223
[2022-12-20 23:36:13] <%SuperiorDavid> Yeah I think they played it safe
[2022-12-20 23:36:21] <galacticlobster> cards feel so weak without them and barely playable with them
[2022-12-20 23:36:34] <minerwator> payoff is good for clearing cards
[2022-12-20 23:36:35] <+savanah1> they should reduce the corpses that u get.. some DK have 30 corpses +.. and increase the value of corpses spent
[2022-12-20 23:36:36] <+kafkekretz> @NoHandsGamer theg ame isj ust not complex enough toi add mechanic like this
[2022-12-20 23:37:11] VIEWERS: 489
[2022-12-20 23:37:15] <sinjako3> @NoHandsGamer  as often as druid ramps and goofs into clearing with scale of onyxia, often it just ramps pointlessly and dies
[2022-12-20 23:37:29] <%vayazu2> that's the ideal design, feels strong when you play it and feels counterable when you face it
[2022-12-20 23:38:03] <meltingnt> i think dk released kinda weak because dh ptsd
[2022-12-20 23:38:04] <Elijahhhgaming> only class they killed in my opinion is druid
[2022-12-20 23:38:12] <minerwator> i got 1600 dust
[2022-12-20 23:38:16] <minerwator> why?
[2022-12-20 23:38:16] <SadLH> are chillers really that good? I do not use them..
[2022-12-20 23:38:16] <meltingnt> jailer owns
[2022-12-20 23:38:26] <+ucdchris1> minerwator did u have a signature anubrekhan
[2022-12-20 23:38:30] <grimBleeper> YEP jailer is cool
[2022-12-20 23:38:31] <%berkiee> @minerwator signature lothamar?
[2022-12-20 23:38:33] <galacticlobster> out of the scaling concepts they've tried with corpses, corrupt. manathirst what do you think works the best?
[2022-12-20 23:38:33] <+ucdchris1> if u did u got 1600 dust for the nerfg
[2022-12-20 23:38:34] <meltingnt> theres that 6/6 that kills you in 3 turns
[2022-12-20 23:38:37] <meltingnt> that guy rules
[2022-12-20 23:38:42] <FenoHS> i mean theres a lot of factors that come into it
[2022-12-20 23:38:42] <minerwator> maybe i was opening 200 packs
[2022-12-20 23:38:44] <FenoHS> its not bad
[2022-12-20 23:38:44] <astroworldhs> A great bad card
[2022-12-20 23:38:51] <FenoHS> just the meta isnt right for it
[2022-12-20 23:38:52] <CASA__yy> aggro clearly wasn't at the top of the meta enough. Control decks had a chance to survive and that's clearly not allowed. So they nerfed Renathal...
[2022-12-20 23:38:52] <SadLH> overseer any day
[2022-12-20 23:38:53] <FenoHS> and also we are at the end of a rotation
[2022-12-20 23:38:57] <FenoHS> so we got so many cards in play
[2022-12-20 23:39:06] <+Onyrius> It’s like egg I think, it feels strong but it’s not that strong 😇
[2022-12-20 23:39:11] <lodk4> I got both signatures anub and loth but got only 1600 dusts
[2022-12-20 23:39:12] VIEWERS: 509
[2022-12-20 23:39:27] <Elijahhhgaming> they killed deathrattle rouge right?
[2022-12-20 23:39:32] <minerwator> i for example like to play casino mage even if its crap
[2022-12-20 23:39:42] <minerwator> feels good to highroll sometimes
[2022-12-20 23:39:42] <+ucdchris1> lothemar im not sure what the case is
[2022-12-20 23:39:42] <meltingnt> dr giga dead yeah
[2022-12-20 23:39:42] <SadLH> wait.. he didn't put Kappa...and yet he wasn't banned????
[2022-12-20 23:39:47] <+ucdchris1> if ur supposed to get another legendary or something
[2022-12-20 23:40:07] <minerwator> @Elijahhhgaming its still playable
[2022-12-20 23:40:11] <tchelet> what are safe disenchants after the nerfs in your opinion? if you're low on dust
[2022-12-20 23:40:16] <+ucdchris1> is horn used here cause u want to coin the 6 drop?
[2022-12-20 23:40:24] <meltingnt> draka is unplayable for sure
[2022-12-20 23:40:31] <+big_spyro> the fact that a card is bad or good depends on the entire environment of the metagame, from a balance standpoint, from the fun standpoint, well, the entire environment depends on his cards in the meta
[2022-12-20 23:40:31] <%berkiee> are you feeling better today nh

[2022-12-20 23:41:14] <+DraganDE> what losing 40hp does to a guy
[2022-12-20 23:41:27] <+SnowMyzer> except we didn't know this nerf was coming lol
[2022-12-20 23:41:28] <JJJ67> This digital card has a -5 on a number Sadge
[2022-12-20 23:41:36] <+Onyrius> I don’t feel your pain NHG but I can understand…
[2022-12-20 23:41:37] <TapLast_> Whar are best decks currently?
[2022-12-20 23:41:42] <+ucdchris1> u lose less hp at 35 then 40, so you actually take less emotional damage kappa
[2022-12-20 23:41:43] <SadLH> time to start the freezes and hope he doesn't heal or kill us Kappa ?
[2022-12-20 23:41:44] <+ucdchris1> Kappa
[2022-12-20 23:41:53] <Agyambagyam> Agree, aggro feels so unforgiving now.... back to the same cycle again
[2022-12-20 23:42:10] <+ucdchris1> aggro always killed u by turn 4-5
[2022-12-20 23:42:11] <%vayazu2> now you take 5 emotional damage every game before it even starts
[2022-12-20 23:42:12] <%+saa_soli> not having 40 health in wild is rough
[2022-12-20 23:42:18] <+ucdchris1> that hasnt changed since face hunter has been a deck since forever
[2022-12-20 23:42:24] <meltingnt> surely he can't deal 22
[2022-12-20 23:42:25] <+ucdchris1> people forgot aggro existed because of renathal
[2022-12-20 23:42:26] <FenoHS> you dont like the meta now?
[2022-12-20 23:42:33] <JJJ67> Renathal was emotionally abusive, you're better off without him Kappa
[2022-12-20 23:42:45] <+ucdchris1> u need to find the new egg priest of thsi meta Kappa
[2022-12-20 23:42:54] <+big_spyro> the meta is the meta
[2022-12-20 23:42:55] <+Dazlidorne> Is two days even enough time to have a meta?!
[2022-12-20 23:42:55] <meltingnt> jackpot rogue ig
[2022-12-20 23:42:56] <%SuperiorDavid> The meta is complaining about the meta
[2022-12-20 23:43:02] <CASA__yy> hearthstone nowadays is so fast and has so much reach that a standard 40 hp for heroes is the consequence
[2022-12-20 23:43:15] <Agyambagyam> I hate to be the generic meta asker after 2 days, but honestly, do you think priest will be good post nerf?

[2022-12-20 23:44:41] <%+arpeggi_hs> renathal wasn’t holding back efficiency hs, and they know that because they nerfed a bunch of efficient decks
[2022-12-20 23:44:45] <+big_spyro> do the hs design team reach any proplayer when they are balancing?
[2022-12-20 23:44:45] <Erabus31> I hated it :)

[2022-12-20 23:45:26] <%vayazu2> i never liked the card but don't complain all day about it. i think the same people complain about different things all the time
[2022-12-20 23:45:28] <CASA__yy> I loved it. more in deepth games like the good old metas
[2022-12-20 23:45:31] <+Onyrius> I think 35 health is a good compromise
[2022-12-20 23:45:31] <FenoHS> i do think most people liked it
[2022-12-20 23:45:35] <grimBleeper> i didn't like renathal but i don't understand why they nerfed it
[2022-12-20 23:45:43] <jeffm123> Haven’t played dk yet.  Does the class actually have top tier decks already.
[2022-12-20 23:45:46] <+SnowMyzer> then we have this mindless aggro druid lol
[2022-12-20 23:46:00] <Erabus31> nothing will stop me hitting gold with my curse imp warlock now
[2022-12-20 23:46:00] <FenoHS> but i dont think the people that liked it are that much more than the people who didnt like it / didnt care for it
[2022-12-20 23:46:01] <SpykoNukov> @jeffm123 FFF seems close to it
[2022-12-20 23:46:02] <youngmoneygangsterqq> that still doesnt make sense though really bc prenerf renathal already gave the option to do either no?
[2022-12-20 23:46:07] <CASA__yy> they could evem reduce the deck by 35 too. Than it would be still playable
[2022-12-20 23:46:10] <Sriex> look how they massacred my little boy
[2022-12-20 23:46:24] <JJJ67> I see a lot of glad people as well, think decktechs poll also had people mainly all across of like, neutral and hate
[2022-12-20 23:46:35] <FenoHS> i dont see that at all
[2022-12-20 23:46:40] <FenoHS> maybe its just a reddit thing
[2022-12-20 23:46:45] <meltingnt> EZ
[2022-12-20 23:46:55] <%vayazu2> that's how internet bubbles work
[2022-12-20 23:47:04] <%WezaRipoto> the main subreddit or compHS? because the opinion of the former doesnt matter lol
[2022-12-20 23:47:15] <+rjones800> i think they nerfed it to shake up the meta and compete with Snap.  not bc it deserved a nerf.

[2022-12-20 23:47:33] <Jimmy_Page_> so do we blame zeddy for this meta?

[2022-12-20 23:52:30] <%matmarex> @shibainuboy yeah and? it's completely different decks. and they did nerf the #1 slow deck enabler, so i guess thta was intended

[2022-12-20 23:52:44] <%rexmkh> ultimate skill
[2022-12-20 23:52:44] <SadLH> ...oh this is better
[2022-12-20 23:52:46] <CASA__yy> renathal with 35/35 would be so awesome. The game is faster and renathal still useable in the meta. Everyone would be happy, but they had to kill this card. Really sad ...

[2022-12-20 23:53:35] <Magnarn1> renethal enables midrange
[2022-12-20 23:53:40] <%rexmkh> no hands knew he would draw the 6 mana card. he was just pretending to be nervous Kappa
[2022-12-20 23:53:41] <BLAZK000> is there super hero with luck ability??
[2022-12-20 23:54:27] <JJJ67> How does VS shit on midrange, they heralded Beast Hunter as the best deck a lot
[2022-12-20 23:54:38] <SpykoNukov> @BLAZK000 I remember a comic series where goofy, donald and co became super hero so the lucky cousin duck was a super hero with chance as it's super power
[2022-12-20 23:54:44] <shibainuboy> but the card is still good
[2022-12-20 23:54:51] <shibainuboy> like wut
[2022-12-20 23:54:58] <BLAZK000> cool
[2022-12-20 23:55:06] <+ucdchris1> they will fix this by making renathal a 4/4 Kappa
[2022-12-20 23:55:14] <CASA__yy> a real pro can outtempo a 40 hp opponent ;)

[2022-12-20 23:55:30] <%+arpeggi_hs> The existence of midrange wasn’t holding back the streamlined decks though. Quest DH  and Miracle Rogue players weren’t upset that other people were playing midrange.
[2022-12-20 23:55:53] <grimBleeper> if renathal was op then it should have been nerfed last expansion, if it was overplayed then it should have been nerfed last expansion when it was ramp druid, beast hunter, thief rogue
[2022-12-20 23:56:00] <SadLH> nice draw
[2022-12-20 23:56:40] <%rexmkh> buffed card pog

[2022-12-20 23:57:32] <SadLH> if only we had a frost strike to kill our own..
[2022-12-20 23:57:50] <SadLH> they always have it..
[2022-12-20 23:57:59] <%rexmkh> no scale prayge
[2022-12-20 23:58:09] <+Samuelphamuel> Heart strike woulda been lethal from visor
[2022-12-20 23:58:20] <+Dazlidorne> Cooking tip:  Never sub vanilla almond milk for milk when making hamburger helper.  It tastes awful!
[2022-12-20 23:58:23] <%+earl_of_darkness> time for another couple of months of thief rogue and alignment druid
[2022-12-20 23:58:33] <JJJ67> Heart strike is minion only
[2022-12-20 23:58:33] <SadLH> still no scales?
[2022-12-20 23:58:42] <grimBleeper> @Dazlidorne YEP will remember that
[2022-12-20 23:58:50] <+Samuelphamuel> Heart strike on lady to double frost spells
[2022-12-20 23:58:53] <SadLH> they have so many tools to draw..
[2022-12-20 23:58:54] <SpykoNukov> @JJJ67 yeah, kill deathwhisper with to duplicatd the burst spells

[2022-12-20 23:59:32] <Protoplasmascope> how much mana worth was that
