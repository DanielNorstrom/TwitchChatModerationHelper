Copenhagen is still one of the favorites for the title, however if Midtjylland is not ending in top 6 in the regular season, they should be smashing every team in the playoff, maybe worth keeping a eye on

[2023-01-07 13:53:21] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> Definitely think with both your propensity for picking attackers but also with the number of attacking picks you get in reserves, you should take defence first to get a better defence.

[2023-01-07 17:52:55] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> @danielxdabo I think they do have to be careful. Because if it becomes too easy  to go totally f2p and enter the limited divisions it will murder the market

[2023-01-07 17:54:45] <$andreww3104> base icon pack surely ?
[2023-01-07 17:54:49] <Erzu97> @bradnufc459 kimpembe's 86 special card is in packs so no you cant
[2023-01-07 17:54:53] <sourenaaa> why do you get informs in bronze pack then?
[2023-01-07 17:54:53] <%+FBSLeo> so how can i get the ifs in bronzes packs?
[2023-01-07 17:54:54] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> @lRickybalboal You said sorare is for rich people, and that to do "anything worthwhile" you have to spend real money. The conversation was in relation to sorare being better than FPL where there is literally no cash prize whatsoever. In comparison, it is the best thing since sliced bread. It is 100% the best iteration of fantasy football. It is not only the playground of the rich and its certainly more "worthwhile" than farting around FPL.
[2023-01-07 17:54:56] <bigboybarrybrown69> Worth doing 75/83s
[2023-01-07 17:54:58] <+lRickybalboal> what about inform in a bronze pack??
[2023-01-07 17:54:58] <+GingeTom> How can you get 79 rated IFs in bronze packs then?
[2023-01-07 17:54:59] <%AHumanAlien> @AaronBrookes94 That's probably it isn't it. Claiming everthing probably adds 20 days worth of gameplay across 1 year
[2023-01-07 17:55:01] <+stunnano1> cheeky lil keylor navas might appear from these packs
[2023-01-07 17:55:04] <@sorarejosh> @AHumanAlien that would be fine , but eventually the novelty of winning commons to earn more commons will fade away
[2023-01-07 17:55:14] <+rkel96> i don't think so nep, i got Hernani from a four silver players upgrade pack in winter wildcards

[2023-01-07 17:55:26] <+CastellaTTV> sure? I'm pretty sure i'v seen some pack butlands special from silver packs?
[2023-01-07 17:55:34] <%jbrownie22> You can get promo cards from silver packs
[2023-01-07 17:55:36] <+kalheade84> I got Hernani and Touljan from silver packs
[2023-01-07 17:55:40] <%+nessiemad13> got Vieira and etoo from the 2 icon picks after completely mudding my club for them and Zidane, happy with that tbf
[2023-01-07 17:55:55] <+lRickybalboal> @spreadsheetfifa I'll kindly disagree with you but I respect your opinion
[2023-01-07 17:56:05] <Erzu97> I have packed Boateng 87 3 times from silver packs
[2023-01-07 17:56:13] <+danielxdabo> @sorarejosh I'm not sure it would for many, millions play FPL for literally nothing but enjoying the gameplay
[2023-01-07 17:56:16] <logankerr96> Let‚Äôs hope for better pack luck than the league sbc speed run
[2023-01-07 17:56:18] <%AHumanAlien> @sorarejosh That's fair. A half way house where there are more options than just common casual would be good. Plus 1 or two other divisions maybe
[2023-01-07 17:56:22] <$myridemypride> think there are packs in milestones aswell for scoring

[2023-01-07 17:57:16] <+FIFPro1991> im on 2 so far, got Kimpembe untradable, and Sczezny tradable
[2023-01-07 17:57:23] <@sorarejosh> @danielxdabo i've never really got into FPL, but the gameplay compared to sorare is shocking, the scoring system etc, im suprised it is so popular
[2023-01-07 17:57:27] <Post_FUT_Clarity> @spreadsheetfifa I wholeheartedly agree with your take
[2023-01-07 17:57:53] <%+hennuthiinggoes> its always pain
[2023-01-07 17:58:12] <%AHumanAlien> @sorarejosh I think its because there hasn't been another good option until Sorare
[2023-01-07 17:58:24] <+danielxdabo> @sorarejosh sorare is 100x better for gameplay. it's so interesting. been playing for about 2 years now. Excited for the prem to come onboard and see how the platform develops

[2023-01-07 17:58:56] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> @TheJamieP123 Easy is 100% the reason why. Sorare is way too analytical for a proper mass market.

[2023-01-07 19:04:30] <+anishp4tel> If it was tradable then yes
[2023-01-07 19:04:30] <%+jjw98__> Trolling surely MiniK
[2023-01-07 19:04:31] <Creativename_> you think you're getting more than 11 85s in there??
[2023-01-07 19:04:31] <+Reinaldo_C> Like 90k to do
[2023-01-07 19:04:32] <%lpd1996> hmm I'm not picking up what you are putting down nep i cant lie

[2023-01-07 19:04:33] <joely198736> if there is 33 83+ I'd agree
[2023-01-07 19:04:34] <%+dougee93> there is no chance you will make the fodder you put in back
[2023-01-07 19:04:34] <amblerr19> STILL HAS PROMOS LUL
[2023-01-07 19:04:35] <mr_trxgger> thats not good value
[2023-01-07 19:04:35] <%+ray_rockwood> Those Ligue 1 silvers are still high
[2023-01-07 19:04:36] <azim1903> Nep you‚Äôre better than this
[2023-01-07 19:04:37] <stennnnnnnnnnnnnnnn> this pack would be like 350k in the store it's good value
[2023-01-07 19:04:37] <ryannorthey1995> love a good ad break
[2023-01-07 19:04:37] <+castrogoal> you hve 6 days
[2023-01-07 19:04:38] <%+OddSlice> the pack is definitely cheaper than those 100 player packs from Black Friday
[2023-01-07 19:04:38] <LukaTee> 3 squads for 2 walkouts :D
[2023-01-07 19:04:39] <+Fifamatt9> Is this worth saving for TOTY?
[2023-01-07 19:04:40] <FUTstradamus> youll never get  back what youve invested, NEVER! xD
[2023-01-07 19:04:40] <+mrperfection27> That was a base icon sbc value in the past
[2023-01-07 19:04:40] <+T___Train> W value

[2023-01-07 19:04:42] <sebahattin_t> You will get a 82 max
[2023-01-07 19:04:42] <+charliecole45> It‚Äôs about 120k where 125k only gets you 30 players
[2023-01-07 19:04:44] <ando1977> Is there a minimum guarantee rated?
[2023-01-07 19:04:44] <+zacj888> out of 80 rare gold cards you need to get 11 85s 11 84s and 11 83 not worth it
[2023-01-07 19:04:45] <$LilFishFart> Hold up let him cook
[2023-01-07 19:04:45] <%m3elv1n> its more worth it than the 100 players store pack

[2023-01-07 19:05:03] <Mr_Arneg> 110k value atm.. 100k pack has 24 players, this one has 80
[2023-01-07 19:05:03] <+fifaant98> this is ea trying to take fodder before toty

[2023-01-07 19:05:04] <mymanenjoy> If you opened that store pack you know how awful this pack will be, maybe like a page of 83+s max
[2023-01-07 19:05:05] <steffens1234> Good for toty
[2023-01-07 19:05:09] <+danielxdabo> its untradable and you aint getting that fodder back out of it
[2023-01-07 19:05:11] <lucas_d23> Just did it and packed Mbappe

[2023-01-07 19:05:16] <1234567sui> for toty
[2023-01-07 19:05:18] <s4__mo> It‚Äôs a good value if you‚Äôre blind
[2023-01-07 19:05:19] <%jjaden10> Any silvers that are specials rn?
[2023-01-07 19:05:21] <%+HugoStiglitz1886> Go on lad GL
[2023-01-07 19:05:25] <%$TraFFi_csgo> you will prob get that 85 squad back in fodder if you are unlucky, and most of the time prob even more than you "payed" i think
[2023-01-07 19:05:27] <+tunined> i didnt even get 1 walkout
[2023-01-07 19:05:28] <+B_Ro11z> its cool but meh value
[2023-01-07 19:05:30] <jayyjokerr> Fodder funnel from EA
[2023-01-07 19:05:32] <fatfortnitevirgin> 20 silvers is an L
[2023-01-07 19:05:33] <%dedsec19966> it might be good for toty though
[2023-01-07 19:05:35] <%chrisparks21> Just do league SBCs if you get dupes
[2023-01-07 19:05:35] <+T___Train> silvers are expensive now
[2023-01-07 19:05:39] <+danielxdabo> do you think you're getting all this fodder back out?

[2023-01-07 19:05:50] <+castrogoal> 6 days to grind the 100 player pack
[2023-01-07 19:05:52] <+tunined> 84 dzeko as my highest LUL
[2023-01-07 19:05:52] <%+scholsey_18> agreed
[2023-01-07 19:05:52] <%EasyGriezy> probably worth it for toty
[2023-01-07 19:05:52] <astxnsttv> tou wouldn‚Äôt be able to build an 85 84 and 83 squad with the contents of the pack. nowhere near
[2023-01-07 19:05:53] <+jamiemacpherson1099> What value would you give it for project toty, 300k coin value?
[2023-01-07 19:05:55] <+anthonycatalanotto> Save for TOTU
[2023-01-07 19:05:55] <Jeroyk> i agree with nep
[2023-01-07 19:05:56] <%m3elv1n> 10x 84+ from draft obj
[2023-01-07 19:05:56] <%lpd1996> if you get lucky its a W if you dont its an L just like most things on fifa
[2023-01-07 19:05:57] <+danielxdabo> doesn't make it good value though
[2023-01-07 19:05:57] <%brane2345> this song is a banger

[2023-01-07 19:05:58] <gunster42> 84x5 isn't worth it to you but this is lol no shot
[2023-01-07 19:05:58] <+anthonycatalanotto> save it for TOTY

[2023-01-07 19:06:01] <mrmikey2509> I assume this 100 player pack wouldn't have icons in it?
[2023-01-07 19:06:01] <+fifaant98> if youre rinsing its worth but save your fodder imo
[2023-01-07 19:06:02] <lucas_d23> I agree mate it‚Äôs worth it. People just being snowflakes
[2023-01-07 19:06:04] <uncledavethebrave> I want a mid icon. Nothing else
[2023-01-07 19:06:04] <kayddycaain> im not though

[2023-01-07 19:06:19] <fataarons> Is it rare golds tho?

[2023-01-07 19:06:29] <TuKay2K> save for TOTY
[2023-01-07 19:06:30] <sheadylano2003> 83 squad is easy , 84 is okay , so basically the 85 squad is the only proper grind to do
[2023-01-07 19:06:30] <Mr_Arneg> futbin has it at 110k, seems gv to me also
[2023-01-07 19:06:32] <here4rewards_> Majority of people have no idea about League SBC grinding, this is a good SBC

[2023-01-07 19:06:43] <TylerJ> sometimes the odds are horrible for some packs like this, which would make the pack bad even if it seems good
[2023-01-07 19:06:43] <LukaTee> 100k sbc for rare golds ....
[2023-01-07 19:06:43] <+danielxdabo> just dont see how you're getting better than 2 82s, 11 83s, 11 84s and 9 85s back out of the pack

[2023-01-07 19:10:06] <here4rewards_> 120k for this SBC for 80 rare golds, or 125k pack for 30 gold rares. Seems like good value

[2023-01-07 19:10:07] <+kalheade84> its different, its grindable, i like it

[2023-01-07 19:10:10] <+Styalize> when all rares are 1k come TOTY that pack is value for money

[2023-01-07 19:10:11] <AbdulTarar> you submitted 11 83s, 11 84s and 11 85s for 80 rare gods under 85 rated, thats awful value

[2023-01-07 19:10:12] <TylerJ> it doesnt make any sense that a 100k pack gets you better odds than a 100 player pack

[2023-01-07 19:19:32] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> The amount of times weve gone to whip a ball in and look at Martial who couldnt win a header against a child. Having a 7 foot animal in there is going to be amazing

[2023-01-07 19:25:24] <AbdulTarar> why would you farm a pack that gives you an 85 rated as the highest player though?
[2023-01-07 19:25:25] <+plantedwharf545> @jjaden10 Lmao i will if we play
[2023-01-07 19:25:27] <+joncell7> Fam it n get wat doh lol
[2023-01-07 19:25:38] <here4rewards_> Nep, a 125k pack give 30 golds, this SBC gives 80 rare gold and is grindable at 110k ish
[2023-01-07 19:25:42] <+ab51194> its worth a shot at TOTY. Just another massive pack for TOTY pack openings
[2023-01-07 19:25:43] <Creativename_> But you can't. How are you meant to do this if you also want Mahrez and Zizou? Why would anyone choose the pack instead of the 20 odd players you can do

[2023-01-07 19:25:47] <%+mikekozy23> its 4/5 the pack for 1/5 the value. its good value
[2023-01-07 19:25:49] <+kilvino> 80 gold rares are 50k at the market. so at the absolute WORST case, you get half your money back. how is this a bad pack LOL

[2023-01-07 19:27:05] <%+biggestalph> During tots you always need gold rates for upgrades, do with untradeables now and open when you have now golds left in 2 week etc, good value
[2023-01-07 19:27:06] <%+shezzzzzzzz> Plus, and most importantly, its virtual coins and content. Its supposed to be something to enjoy, not stress about milking every last bit of value out of everything.

[2023-01-07 19:27:30] <%$Rocky94RPC> Are you likely to get the 8 85s and 10 84s back you put in? Doubt it. Really not worth at the mo, with what‚Äôs in the store at the mo.. in my opinion anyway. Depends if you wanna risk it for a biscuit I guess
[2023-01-07 19:27:31] <$Philopmedd> Chat that 100 player pack worth it please?

[2023-01-07 19:27:58] <Rian_swain18> with all the fodder from that SBC in a week/ 2 weeks you‚Äôll do a shit tone of player picks and get a lot of the fodder back

[2023-01-07 19:46:34] <%JWISEY249799> it makes you question how we ever got anything in packs before min rating guarentee tbh
[2023-01-07 19:46:36] <+drakeisoverrated> why tf are u so grumpy

[2023-01-07 19:46:39] <madforlan> but you sait it was good
[2023-01-07 19:46:42] <hernancrespo2022> If zidane wasn‚Äôt his name he would cost 300k
[2023-01-07 19:46:48] <adshad2> Bro switched up as soon as he actually saw them opened

[2023-01-07 19:47:03] <jayyjokerr> At this point in the year ANY pack with no minimum rating is a fraud imo
[2023-01-07 19:47:03] <CallmeAB> My best player was Busquets hahahaha
[2023-01-07 19:47:03] <+kilvino> it is good. at the worst case you get half your money back. 80 gold rares == 50k at the market
[2023-01-07 19:47:10] <%+fuglyscarecrow> good pack to save for league upgrades during toty?
[2023-01-07 19:47:12] <adriantheimert> Who says he have ears at all
[2023-01-07 19:47:14] <Revealed> Not only is the chance to get promo cards awful, they've given it a 99% chance to be discard value cards only. You can do 20 - 5 player picks for a promo and only get 2 usable out of 100 players
[2023-01-07 19:47:15] <+DeTwinkz> Hey Nep, whats the drops been like from these packs? just got on

[2023-01-07 19:48:05] <$Mythirteen> U said nothing bad about the team tbh but u said the best player on the field wasnt when it clearly was, thats why they were hating but hey dont mind them, they are morons and thats no reason for all that hate, but not all Benfiquistas are like that just the ones that are internet trolls.

[2023-01-07 20:03:10] <nmassey1985> Is he that good?
[2023-01-07 20:03:11] <AbdulTarar> Enzo is better than De Jong already imo, He's a top top player
[2023-01-07 20:03:14] <+kilvino> these packs are good. if you literally went to the market and tried to buy every player in the pack, you would pay more than 100k, which is the cost of the pack.
[2023-01-07 20:03:19] <+aidanlv_> what makes enzo so good in your opinion
[2023-01-07 20:03:23] <RafaKDB> Changing Benfica for chelsea is a huge downgrade
[2023-01-07 20:03:26] <+IIMSGIl> Mate you‚Äôve never watched him either remember this comment he won‚Äôt even be as good as Fabian Delph
[2023-01-07 20:03:27] <%+markcheesyy> Lets go Wrexham!! Are we all Wrexham fans now?
[2023-01-07 20:03:29] <Reaneeyy> I hope Enzo isn‚Äôt the next James Rodriguez
[2023-01-07 20:03:32] <$Mythirteen> he need to put his eyes on Aimar and be humble like he was during his carreer and he will be the best mid in the world for years
[2023-01-07 20:03:32] <migueldresantos> yeah but he always played in good performing teams, I think in a bad performing team he won't make the difference like Bellingham can
[2023-01-07 20:03:34] <hitikkumar> Enzo is not better than De jong . OMG people and recency bias
[2023-01-07 20:03:35] <$8ehnz> chelsea isnt the best place for enzo atm
[2023-01-07 20:03:35] <callumlord15> id say de paul played better in the midfield during the world cup campaign
[2023-01-07 20:03:39] <+budmonwiskidal> So overrated holy, no wonder he thinks his shit dont stink
[2023-01-07 20:03:48] <thatirishguy900> Reckon Mudryk comes to Arsenal this month?
[2023-01-07 20:03:49] <boohoo0701> why didn't he start against Saudi then?
[2023-01-07 20:03:51] <RafaKDB> London is red, such as Lisbon
[2023-01-07 20:03:52] <%liamspeed2018> 16ish
[2023-01-07 20:03:55] <hitikkumar> @callumlord15 You're crazy
[2023-01-07 20:04:00] <AbdulTarar> @boohoo0701 and they lost against Saudi.. nice one
[2023-01-07 20:04:03] <hbayyeb44> its not worth it
[2023-01-07 20:04:03] <%+dillon634> Wasn‚Äôt he close to joining chelsea a few days ago? What happened there
[2023-01-07 20:04:10] <the_dude3000> wow that was the worst pack of the mall
[2023-01-07 20:04:12] <the_dude3000> all
[2023-01-07 20:04:12] <+CroaCrado> well he didnt start and see how it went for argentina
[2023-01-07 20:04:17] <+primegoat10> Xavi would rather go for a Spanish overrated midfielder than Enzo
[2023-01-07 20:04:22] <%+Rebzy__voxz> enzo nowhere near overrated lol
[2023-01-07 20:04:25] <%+hendry86> @markcheesyy I'm on that wagon
[2023-01-07 20:04:26] <%blazer33x> compare him to another player
[2023-01-07 20:04:27] <+qwerty_jc> why do i even open packs. got an 82 as my highest rated in the centurian pack.
[2023-01-07 20:04:28] <%+shezzzzzzzz> Hes not overrated, but is he 120million>?
[2023-01-07 20:04:29] <%$oclarkk> over rated doesnt mean bad tbf
[2023-01-07 20:04:32] <+GansoGo> what abot mccalister
[2023-01-07 20:04:34] <%+clanwalk3r> 100 player pack I got 3x86s and nothin else, did a 45k from the league SBC and got gold mbappe üòÇüòÇ makes no sense
[2023-01-07 20:04:36] <$medara55> Very very overrated
[2023-01-07 20:04:37] <zlxxky> glad i stuck at one pack. Managed to get 1*89, 1*86, a bunch of 85/84's and 2 centurians
[2023-01-07 20:04:40] <roesden> 82?? can't be true
[2023-01-07 20:04:45] <+budmonwiskidal> Hes overconfident
[2023-01-07 20:04:46] <thatirishguy900> @shezzzzzzzz thats his buy out clause
[2023-01-07 20:04:47] <%+Rebzy__voxz> @shezzzzzzzz a player doesn‚Äôt determine his price tag that‚Äôs irrelevant
[2023-01-07 20:04:48] <+cianmcsweeney14> CMcSweeney97 open mine pls
[2023-01-07 20:04:48] <%jhunter123> I think he‚Äôs good but he needs a bigger pool of evidence
[2023-01-07 20:04:53] <FarmerManBill> wolves almost signed enzo in the summer but didnt want to wait for libatadores to end LUL
[2023-01-07 20:04:55] [Notification] AaronC2995 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months!
[2023-01-07 20:04:55] <+anthonycatalanotto> Who are we talking about?
[2023-01-07 20:04:57] <hitikkumar> Enzo has amazing passing range and weight of pass, most important things
[2023-01-07 20:04:57] <Micael_Caetano> if you have to pick a Portuguese team, what team would you choose?
[2023-01-07 20:05:00] <AbdulTarar> only game Argentina lost was without Enzo
[2023-01-07 20:05:00] <ajbentley96> Chelsea so close to spending 120mil before all this
[2023-01-07 20:05:00] <boomwap5499> Messi retired and he wrote on Facebook as a 16 year old not to or unretire.  it all came out in the locker after the final. Very emotional
[2023-01-07 20:05:01] <liampatrick99> @markcheesyy no but i am a cheese fan ;)
[2023-01-07 20:05:01] <RafaKDB> The kid is a game changer, he transformed the way he play
[2023-01-07 20:05:02] <+qwerty_jc> @roesden stg this game just shafted me
[2023-01-07 20:05:05] <adriantheimert> He is good, but no way he have shown enough to get called potentially the best for the next 10 years
[2023-01-07 20:05:09] <+IIMSGIl> Overrated Forsure so many better players
[2023-01-07 20:05:10] VIEWERS: 4¬†970
[2023-01-07 20:05:12] <sparrowboi93> Enzo chat is boring mate
[2023-01-07 20:05:15] <%jakehall0762> Enzo had a huge impact in the world cup
[2023-01-07 20:05:15] <+hendez51> I think he is good but I don't think it will work at Chelsea
[2023-01-07 20:05:16] <+TheRaq> Overrated, underrated.. how can he even be "rated" at this point, the guy played few games in tier 3 league and scored a good goal in WC, played nothing special, just decent. Cant tell if hes good or no
[2023-01-07 20:05:16] <+anthonycatalanotto> Who are we debating chat
[2023-01-07 20:05:16] <markthegrinder> he was crucial to argentina's campaign. The lungs on him just offered so much energy to the team
[2023-01-07 20:05:19] <%+markcheesyy> @markcheesyy LUL
[2023-01-07 20:05:21] <%+alexjames21R> West Ham United 1-0 up against Brentford
[2023-01-07 20:05:26] <%+FUTAccountants> west ham 1-0
[2023-01-07 20:05:27] <jayyjokerr> Watch the game you won't see Enzo, watch Enzo you see the whole game!
[2023-01-07 20:05:28] <%+Rebzy__voxz> he was benched game 1 , argentina lose‚Ä¶ he starts for them rest of the tournament see what happens
[2023-01-07 20:05:29] <conuwuxd> mbappe,haaland are  going to be the best over the next 10 years enzo wasnt evem the best youngster on argentina
[2023-01-07 20:05:33] <+fordykyle1> haahaha
[2023-01-07 20:05:34] <+afcevan> Gvardiol probably deserved the golden ball
[2023-01-07 20:05:39] <ibrahemoLo> Haha
[2023-01-07 20:05:39] <callumlord15> de paul is the better argentine midfield imo
[2023-01-07 20:05:40] <boohoo0701> alvarez would have won but it's 21 or under
[2023-01-07 20:05:41] <skeroboy10> People dont understand that Benfica is asking for 120M because we don't want to sell him. He will probably be sold for less in the summer
[2023-01-07 20:05:43] <boomwap5499> Messi retired and he wrote on Facebook as a 16 year old not to or unretire.  it all came out in the locker after the final. Very emotional
[2023-01-07 20:05:44] <%iDersch> @conuwuxd brother we are talking about midfielders

[2023-01-07 20:05:47] <%+bazzay10> I'm enjoying the Enzo chat
[2023-01-07 20:05:49] <$medara55> Not even close that he is worth that kind of money what Benfica is looking.
[2023-01-07 20:05:50] <zlxxky> i havent watched much Enzo, what player would you compare him to in terms of playstyle?
[2023-01-07 20:05:50] <Snipersi459> passive agressive nep is my favourite nep lol
[2023-01-07 20:05:51] <liampatrick99> saka is the next GOAT
[2023-01-07 20:05:51] <Letplanet6> @conuwuxd he said midfield clown
[2023-01-07 20:05:54] <%+pierce_23> these seem awful
[2023-01-07 20:05:55] <AbdulTarar> @conuwuxd he won best youngster at the World Cup, just like Mbappe
[2023-01-07 20:05:57] <+cianmcsweeney14> Enzo reminds me of when frenkie broke on the scene, great footballer
[2023-01-07 20:05:57] <%+shezzzzzzzz> @Rebzy__voxz No he doesnt, but do you think its worth spending ¬£120million on him. thats a lot a lot of money
[2023-01-07 20:05:58] <Jonker_> you should make a football talking short channel
[2023-01-07 20:05:59] <%liamspeed2018> booom

[2023-01-07 20:06:03] <migueldresantos> he's good, but he isn¬¥t as good as Bellingham, Valverde, for me he isn't a difference make. in a bad performing team he won't make the difference
[2023-01-07 20:06:05] <jayyjokerr> doesnt this mean no walkouts LMAO?

[2023-01-07 20:07:00] <+TheRaq> @jayyjokerr not really, I pulled Centurion Alba as a walkout (88 or 87 rated) and there was Casemiro 89 in the pack as well
[2023-01-07 20:07:01] <%+ray_rockwood> i seriously don't know why people get mad when Nep talks about real life football. He's very knowledgeable and interesting and has interesting options
[2023-01-07 20:07:02] <boohoo0701> because he's the only under 21

[2023-01-07 20:07:19] <sparrowboi93> Bro I was just gonna say you could compare Enzo with pedri or something interesting no hate
[2023-01-07 20:07:20] <josedurante20> Alvarez just scored more golas but Enzo was the best young player
[2023-01-07 20:07:25] <%+shezzzzzzzz> @iDersch spending 120million on players is usually just lazy. How many players over ¬£50 million have actually been good buys?
[2023-01-07 20:07:26] <%liamspeed2018> booo
[2023-01-07 20:07:27] <%+teasyy_tom> @boohoo0701 garnacho under 21
[2023-01-07 20:07:29] <+AxEStolli> no shit messi didnt win the young players award
[2023-01-07 20:07:32] <easternmantis10> Monaco out of the French cup
[2023-01-07 20:07:33] <Joe_E3541> mac allister was the best player on that team 100%
[2023-01-07 20:07:33] <fuddyduddygewgaw> Politano, Mahrez, or this pack? I don‚Äôt think I can do all three
[2023-01-07 20:07:34] <AbdulTarar> @josedurante20 Alvarez isn't eligible for under 21 bruv
[2023-01-07 20:07:34] <Niceandfly> The only way I would be satisfied opening this packs if I pack Neymar
[2023-01-07 20:07:36] <%+tyler_kirk> nep when you opened my pack with the 2nd centurion there was Bastoni at the end of duplicate so it was actually 4
[2023-01-07 20:07:40] <conuwuxd> alvarez was definitely the best had a way better performance
[2023-01-07 20:07:41] <RafaKDB> Enzo and a kid from Benfica youth handled PSG and Juventus Midfielder stars, they still didnt left their pockets
[2023-01-07 20:07:46] <arimyrte> nep do you know how many token swaps are available? cuz i have 26
[2023-01-07 20:07:47] <hitikkumar> Enzo was the 2nd best player for argentina in the world cup
[2023-01-07 20:07:50] <vadersmaddogs1> He is very good, can‚Äôt wait to see him at a big club
[2023-01-07 20:07:51] <naappo> Argentina lost to Saudi arabia when Enzo wasn't starting and won the world cup when he was starting
[2023-01-07 20:07:52] <%H0NKTV> what pack is this? how do i get it
[2023-01-07 20:07:54] <+NinetyThreeTwenty> Alvarez clear
[2023-01-07 20:07:55] <+ttvbylebtw> Sad that at this point only player I really hope to pack to fit my team in this promo is Ney/:
[2023-01-07 20:07:55] <+lifterlife> Awful
[2023-01-07 20:07:58] <josedurante20> @AbdulTarar I know, I was talking about young argentina players
[2023-01-07 20:07:59] <liampatrick99> tbh to fill the club up it aint that bad of a pack

[2023-01-07 20:08:07] <conuwuxd> people think he was the 2nd best? joke man
[2023-01-07 20:08:07] <+Tommy_Edman> alvarez would have won of eligible
[2023-01-07 20:08:09] <AbdulTarar> @RafaKDB helped that Messi was injured

[2023-01-07 20:08:13] <%iDersch> @shezzzzzzzz im on your side there, player prices have just become silly. but 120 mil, by comparison to to other players, is alright i think
[2023-01-07 20:08:15] <hitikkumar> Alvarez has like 5 lungs
[2023-01-07 20:08:16] <the_dude3000> Lukakau got the "MIss Boy" award at the WC. Hahahaha, i will see myself out now

[2023-01-07 20:08:27] <%+DirtyDishFC> My worry for Enzo is tournament play can make people stand out by its nature. He plays in a league that can flatter if you play for the big sides.  Remains to be seen

[2023-01-07 20:13:54] <+tetoboi1234> if enzo went to chelsea he would genuinely delay his career progression by a couple of years the way chelsea have been playing
[2023-01-07 20:13:56] <%+chriscfcwooooo> that's why Gabriel Jesus was relatively cheap for arsenal, cause city didn't really need him. If Jesus was at somewhere like crystal Palace he would've been much more expensive
