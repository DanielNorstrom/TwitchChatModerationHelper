[2022-12-26 08:06:33] <@%PendrivE> there is shitload of people who only play new releases etc
[2022-12-26 08:06:42] <!Niezzer_> i thought it was just that good
[2022-12-26 08:06:45] <@%PendrivE> and they don't dare touch any older games
[2022-12-26 08:06:46] <!Niezzer_> or something like that

[2022-12-26 08:07:10] <!Niezzer_> i see why most people are just doing react now
[2022-12-26 08:07:20] <%DistilledHoney> only play new realeases but still complain about there being no games DIESOFCRINGE
[2022-12-26 08:07:28] <@%PendrivE> yup
[2022-12-26 08:07:29] <!Niezzer_> @DistilledHoney Classic
[2022-12-26 08:07:33] <@%PendrivE> have you seen
[2022-12-26 08:07:36] <@%PendrivE> that tweet
[2022-12-26 08:07:40] <!Niezzer_> elisLook
[2022-12-26 08:07:43] <@%PendrivE> about someone being denied partner
[2022-12-26 08:07:49] <%DistilledHoney> don't use twitter
[2022-12-26 08:07:50] <@%PendrivE> due to only reacting?
[2022-12-26 08:07:51] <!Niezzer_> i dont have a twitter
[2022-12-26 08:07:52] <@%PendrivE> LULE
[2022-12-26 08:07:53] <%DistilledHoney> only for porn
[2022-12-26 08:07:56] <!Niezzer_> LULE
[2022-12-26 08:08:01] <!%Atsuelei> I seen that pen
[2022-12-26 08:08:03] <%DistilledHoney> BASED twitch
[2022-12-26 08:08:04] <!%Atsuelei> LULE
[2022-12-26 08:08:05] <!Niezzer_> I didnt know twitch refused people for that
[2022-12-26 08:08:14] <@%PendrivE> it's kinda based
[2022-12-26 08:08:19] <!Niezzer_> i thought if you met the requirements you could just send the thing
[2022-12-26 08:08:19] <@%PendrivE> because reacting isn't really "content"
[2022-12-26 08:08:27] <!Niezzer_> i mean,its just stealing content
[2022-12-26 08:08:31] <@%PendrivE> funny how we were all riled up back in like 2015 or smth
[2022-12-26 08:08:31] <%DistilledHoney> if you do it right it can be
[2022-12-26 08:08:33] <!Niezzer_> from people who already made it
[2022-12-26 08:08:36] <@%PendrivE> at the reactors on yt
[2022-12-26 08:08:38] <@%PendrivE> remember that?
[2022-12-26 08:08:44] <!%Atsuelei> gn for real this time veiSleep
[2022-12-26 08:08:47] <@%PendrivE> and we're now fine with the same shit ICANT
[2022-12-26 08:08:49] <!Niezzer_> oh shit yeah
[2022-12-26 08:08:50] <%DistilledHoney> if you add good stuff to the content you react to
[2022-12-26 08:08:56] <%DistilledHoney> Tuckahomie fr atsu
[2022-12-26 08:09:05] <!Niezzer_> @DistilledHoney that doesnt really help much imo
[2022-12-26 08:09:10] <@%PendrivE> well
[2022-12-26 08:09:19] <@%PendrivE> it takes x amount of time to react
[2022-12-26 08:09:28] <@%PendrivE> some of the videos people react to take 2-3 weeks to make
[2022-12-26 08:09:31] <@%PendrivE> or longer
[2022-12-26 08:09:34] <@%PendrivE> so uhhh monkaLaugh
[2022-12-26 08:09:36] <!Niezzer_> I remember there was a boom in react content on yt and people started complaining about it back then
[2022-12-26 08:09:49] <!Niezzer_> idk why people never complained here on twitch
[2022-12-26 08:09:52] <%+Nanu991> react andys classic
[2022-12-26 08:09:56] <%+Nanu991> Classic
[2022-12-26 08:10:02] <@%PendrivE> I mean some complain
[2022-12-26 08:10:14] <!Niezzer_> but the majority dont I think
[2022-12-26 08:10:14] <@%PendrivE> check out darkviperau on yt pepeLaugh
[2022-12-26 08:10:19] <!Niezzer_> oh yeah pepeLaugh
[2022-12-26 08:10:21] <!Niezzer_> i know him
[2022-12-26 08:10:31] <@%PendrivE> I watched that whole series he made about it
[2022-12-26 08:10:34] <!Niezzer_> i used to watch his speedruns
[2022-12-26 08:10:49] <!Niezzer_> i read his document back when he first published it
[2022-12-26 08:10:49] <@%PendrivE> and he has a lot of very legitimate concerns about react "content"
[2022-12-26 08:11:06] <@%PendrivE> just looking from the content creation perspective
[2022-12-26 08:11:30] <%DistilledHoney> honestly I enjoy it more as a watchalong experience
[2022-12-26 08:11:33] <@%PendrivE> and what can happen in a while if it continues etc
[2022-12-26 08:11:41] <%DistilledHoney> watching stuff with chat and strimmer
[2022-12-26 08:11:41] <!Niezzer_> i gave that some thought before,like the streamer having to pin the video hes watching or making views from twitch count on youtube
[2022-12-26 08:11:46] <!Niezzer_> but theres no real good solution
[2022-12-26 08:11:54] <@%PendrivE> yup
[2022-12-26 08:11:58] <@%PendrivE> I will say tho
[2022-12-26 08:12:07] <%DistilledHoney> only very rarely is the stuff the reactor adds to it actually good
[2022-12-26 08:12:09] <@%PendrivE> if you react and put up the entire reaction to your actual yt channel afterwards
[2022-12-26 08:12:22] <@%PendrivE> the creator of the og vid should be getting at least 50/50 adsense on this
[2022-12-26 08:12:30] <!Niezzer_> peepoGiggle
[2022-12-26 08:12:49] <!Niezzer_> i think the original creator should get more
[2022-12-26 08:12:56] <!Niezzer_> like 70/30
[2022-12-26 08:12:58] <!Niezzer_> minimum
[2022-12-26 08:13:00] <@%PendrivE> yeah hence hwy "at least" veiNodders
[2022-12-26 08:13:20] <!Niezzer_> I can only imagine the amount of furious streamers complaining
[2022-12-26 08:13:27] <!Niezzer_> specially hasan and xqc
[2022-12-26 08:13:49] <@%PendrivE> otherwise it just sucks, since you're basically reuploading someone's content in its entirety with just additional commentary, which will never be as substantial in content as the video itself veiSalute
[2022-12-26 08:14:19] <!Niezzer_> i cant type dm ca OMEGADANCEBUTFAST
[2022-12-26 08:14:25] <@%PendrivE> oh yeah
[2022-12-26 08:14:29] <!Niezzer_> i just wrote a giant thing and it didnt send
[2022-12-26 08:14:30] <@%PendrivE> it's because people are braindead
[2022-12-26 08:14:35] <!Niezzer_> i know dw
[2022-12-26 08:14:36] <@%PendrivE> and we have split vod track setup
[2022-12-26 08:14:55] <%DistilledHoney> what's the problem with letting other people do the majority of your content? Clueleg
[2022-12-26 08:14:56] <!Niezzer_> I was always surprised react content didnt fall into the dm ca thing
[2022-12-26 08:15:01] <@%PendrivE> and vei got tired of seeing "STREAMER, YOU GONNA GET BANNANNED FOR DM CA!!!!!! Pepega üì£ "
[2022-12-26 08:15:10] <!Niezzer_> you can type it btw pen
[2022-12-26 08:15:16] <!Niezzer_> mods can type blocked words
[2022-12-26 08:15:29] <@%PendrivE> hmm, I remember not being able to a long time ago
[2022-12-26 08:15:33] <!Niezzer_> the split vod track thing is so good
[2022-12-26 08:15:36] <@%PendrivE> dmca
[2022-12-26 08:15:41] <@%PendrivE> yeah it works
[2022-12-26 08:15:51] <@%PendrivE> wonder why it didn't let me back then
[2022-12-26 08:15:58] <@%PendrivE> oh
[2022-12-26 08:16:02] <@%PendrivE> it could be the words
[2022-12-26 08:16:09] <!Niezzer_> there has been a lot of changes to moderation since corona
[2022-12-26 08:16:13] <@%PendrivE> that are only visible to the owner of the account or smth
[2022-12-26 08:16:17] <@%PendrivE> since you can hide them from mods
[2022-12-26 08:16:20] <!Niezzer_> oh
[2022-12-26 08:16:45] <@%PendrivE> twitch blocked words are stupid anyway
[2022-12-26 08:16:48] <!Niezzer_> tbh twitch has some weird moderation shit
[2022-12-26 08:16:51] <@%PendrivE> there is no regex
[2022-12-26 08:16:54] <!Niezzer_> like shadowbans
[2022-12-26 08:17:02] <@%PendrivE> well, restrictions are nice
[2022-12-26 08:17:13] <@%PendrivE> because I don't punish someone to the point they can't even sub or get gifted
[2022-12-26 08:17:20] <!Niezzer_> i mean,with regex it could become a problem
[2022-12-26 08:17:20] <@%PendrivE> they just speak to the void pretty much
[2022-12-26 08:17:30] <!Niezzer_> like those games that censor ass in lass or bass
[2022-12-26 08:17:33] <@%PendrivE> but they can still be subbed and get gifted, so that's nice in a way
[2022-12-26 08:17:54] <@%PendrivE> yeah our regex in SE can sometimes catch something random too
[2022-12-26 08:17:54] <!Niezzer_> i think perma timeouts should be a thing
[2022-12-26 08:18:05] <!Niezzer_> you can still get gifted and shit
[2022-12-26 08:18:12] <!Niezzer_> and see chat
[2022-12-26 08:18:13] <@%PendrivE> yeah restriction works like that
[2022-12-26 08:18:16] <!Niezzer_> just not chat yourself
[2022-12-26 08:18:17] <@%PendrivE> the only thing is
[2022-12-26 08:18:22] <!Niezzer_> hmm
[2022-12-26 08:18:23] <@%PendrivE> it doesn't tell you, which is stupid
[2022-12-26 08:18:30] <@%PendrivE> it's completely silence
[2022-12-26 08:18:33] <@%PendrivE> *silent
[2022-12-26 08:18:46] <@%PendrivE> and also
[2022-12-26 08:18:47] <@%PendrivE> fun fact
[2022-12-26 08:18:51] <!Niezzer_> wait,so someone can just type in a streamer's chat forever without knowing theyre restricted?
[2022-12-26 08:18:57] <@%PendrivE> there is no lists of restricted users available
[2022-12-26 08:18:59] <@%PendrivE> monkaMega
[2022-12-26 08:19:11] <@%PendrivE> and you cannot request an unban
[2022-12-26 08:19:12] <!Niezzer_> so even you dont know whos restricted here?
[2022-12-26 08:19:16] <!Niezzer_> huh
[2022-12-26 08:19:17] <@%PendrivE> yup
[2022-12-26 08:19:24] <!Niezzer_> what do you even do to get unrestricted then
[2022-12-26 08:19:30] <@%PendrivE> so we only restrict very hardcore cancerous cases
[2022-12-26 08:19:39] <@%PendrivE> prob dm mods
[2022-12-26 08:19:40] <!Niezzer_> mikey ?
[2022-12-26 08:19:41] <@%PendrivE> Clueleg
[2022-12-26 08:19:57] <!Niezzer_> tbh I dont see much cancer here
[2022-12-26 08:20:09] <!Niezzer_> mainly thirsty weebs or like mikey style chatters
[2022-12-26 08:20:14] <@%PendrivE> restriction is just good for schizos
[2022-12-26 08:20:22] <!Niezzer_> SCHIZO
[2022-12-26 08:20:23] <@%PendrivE> who you know will not get better no matter what you do
[2022-12-26 08:20:29] <%Spyanide> SCHIZO
[2022-12-26 08:20:41] <@%PendrivE> and it's just painful to watch them descend into madness more and more TriSad
[2022-12-26 08:21:04] <@%PendrivE> I will say tho
[2022-12-26 08:21:20] <@%PendrivE> there should be requests for lifting restrictions
[2022-12-26 08:21:25] <!Niezzer_> have you seen that chatter that got the fbi sent to his home because he threatened to shoot a school or some shit
[2022-12-26 08:21:25] <@%PendrivE> because right now it's really fucking stupid
[2022-12-26 08:21:32] <%Spyanide> LeftHand babyMonka
[2022-12-26 08:21:41] <@%PendrivE> well, that's reasonable if they said that lmao
[2022-12-26 08:22:01] <%DistilledHoney> didn't the guy go to jail niez?
[2022-12-26 08:22:03] <!Niezzer_> classic twitch halfway job,same with the shield mode thing
[2022-12-26 08:22:03] <@%PendrivE> edgy kids SMH
[2022-12-26 08:22:14] <!Niezzer_> @DistilledHoney dont think so? i dont remember rn
[2022-12-26 08:22:19] <!Niezzer_> it wasnt even a kid
[2022-12-26 08:22:21] <%DistilledHoney> me neither
[2022-12-26 08:22:22] <!Niezzer_> guy looked old
[2022-12-26 08:22:28] <@%PendrivE> shield mode as an anti-raid measure Clueless
[2022-12-26 08:22:32] <@%PendrivE> yeah just don't let the bots speak
[2022-12-26 08:22:42] <@%PendrivE> surely leaving them unbanned without knowing their names even will be fine
[2022-12-26 08:22:43] <!Niezzer_> shield mode is absolute garbage
[2022-12-26 08:22:45] <@%PendrivE> Clueleg
[2022-12-26 08:22:56] <!Niezzer_> at first I thought it had the nuke feature from fossa built in
[2022-12-26 08:22:59] <!Niezzer_> but it hasnt
[2022-12-26 08:23:31] <@%PendrivE> one day twitch will have good and logical moderation tools FeelsStrongMan
[2022-12-26 08:23:33] <!Niezzer_> only times ive seen shield mode were when someone accidentally clicked it because of its shit positioning
[2022-12-26 08:23:40] <!Niezzer_> Clueless surely
[2022-12-26 08:23:45] <@%PendrivE> yup
[2022-12-26 08:23:49] <@%PendrivE> I've heard about those cases LULE
[2022-12-26 08:24:01] <!Niezzer_> i mean,youtube has even worse mod tools I think
[2022-12-26 08:24:07] <@%PendrivE> oh fuck that
[2022-12-26 08:24:11] <@%PendrivE> I don't even wanna imagine
[2022-12-26 08:24:18] <@%PendrivE> modding on youtube OMEGADANCEBUTFAST
[2022-12-26 08:24:20] <!Niezzer_> youtube chat doesnt even work
[2022-12-26 08:24:28] <!Niezzer_> people cant even chat properly
[2022-12-26 08:24:30] <!Niezzer_> imagine modding
[2022-12-26 08:24:40] <%Spyanide> dude people get auto restricted randomly
[2022-12-26 08:24:43] <!Niezzer_> i wonder how ludwig's mods even do shit
[2022-12-26 08:24:43] <%Spyanide> lmao
[2022-12-26 08:24:52] <!Niezzer_> cause they earn money from modding
[2022-12-26 08:24:59] <@%PendrivE> yeah I heard something about yt modding from fellow moderators from other communities PepeLaugh
[2022-12-26 08:25:09] <@%PendrivE> it is not very good apparently ROBERT

[2022-12-26 08:25:52] <@%PendrivE> funniest thing is, when someone's restricted here on twitch
[2022-12-26 08:26:01] <%Spyanide> only way you can tell is if they have chat on screen and ur message doesnt pop up anymore
[2022-12-26 08:26:03] <@%PendrivE> you can see their messages in native chat, in real time
[2022-12-26 08:26:08] <@%PendrivE> but they don't go to any logs

[2022-12-26 08:33:25] <@%PendrivE> I specifically asked for the feature
[2022-12-26 08:33:33] <@%PendrivE> because otherwise we would not have christmas emotes rn Clueleg
[2022-12-26 08:33:35] <!Niezzer_> Pog
[2022-12-26 08:33:50] <@%PendrivE> if I would have to manually remove and readd 70+ emotes each holiday

[2022-12-26 08:34:29] <@%PendrivE> or bttv since bttv has so many slots free rn
[2022-12-26 08:34:46] <!Niezzer_> remove ICANT and add it instead so you dont use slots
[2022-12-26 08:34:53] <!Niezzer_> theyre pretty much the same anyway

[2022-12-26 08:54:32] <@%PendrivE> in the past I liked the game corruption streams the most
[2022-12-26 08:54:34] <!Niezzer_> oh he was
[2022-12-26 08:54:46] <@%PendrivE> but now the android trash streams are the best sodaHappy

[2022-12-26 08:57:26] <!Niezzer_> what games have you been playing ? =
[2022-12-26 08:57:32] <@%PendrivE> but it depends on a game for me veiSalute
[2022-12-26 08:57:39] <!Niezzer_> hmm
[2022-12-26 08:57:57] <!Niezzer_> i generally watched cuts of vods on youtube from time to time
[2022-12-26 08:58:06] <!Niezzer_> but actual full vods are weird
[2022-12-26 08:58:13] <@%PendrivE> recently I haven't been playing much, I just play car sims mostly and then recently some zomboid again, some Warzone 2.0 with friends etc
[2022-12-26 08:58:24] <!Niezzer_> sometimes I go to answer something to the streamer but then I go to type and its just a replay
[2022-12-26 08:58:27] <!Niezzer_> i feel so dumb

[2022-12-26 08:59:04] <@%PendrivE> yeah it's good, I just like survival games veiNodders
[2022-12-26 08:59:17] <!Niezzer_> I want to try car sims with those wheels and pedals at least once
[2022-12-26 08:59:25] <!Niezzer_> surely i wont be bad at it
[2022-12-26 08:59:43] <!Niezzer_> tbh aside from old games there isnt much new
[2022-12-26 08:59:47] <@%PendrivE> it's great, but definitely challenging especially if you drive irl
[2022-12-26 08:59:49] <!Niezzer_> even forsen is doing elden ring again
[2022-12-26 09:00:00] <@%PendrivE> since it's not 100% accurate
[2022-12-26 09:00:09] <!Niezzer_> thats gonna feel weird

[2022-12-26 09:00:27] <@%PendrivE> and you don't really feel the speed in most of the car sims
[2022-12-26 09:00:31] <@%PendrivE> not as much as you do irl
[2022-12-26 09:00:32] <!Niezzer_> i remember seeing like lewis hamilton playing forza
[2022-12-26 09:00:39] <!Niezzer_> he was pretty good
[2022-12-26 09:00:47] <!Niezzer_> so maybe it will be the case for me
[2022-12-26 09:00:58] <!Niezzer_> i mean irl theres g forces and shit
[2022-12-26 09:01:05] <@%PendrivE> I will just say that forza is better on controller, since it's a little bit too arcade-y
[2022-12-26 09:01:17] <@%PendrivE> at least Horizon series
[2022-12-26 09:01:19] <!Niezzer_> so I wouldnt expect car sims to be that great at representing the feeling
[2022-12-26 09:01:27] <!Niezzer_> @PendrivE he did motorsport
[2022-12-26 09:01:33] <@%PendrivE> yeah that's a little bit better
[2022-12-26 09:01:50] <@%PendrivE> Assetto Corsa is one of the most realistic
[2022-12-26 09:02:01] <The_Reaper_719> ashiShy
[2022-12-26 09:02:03] <!Niezzer_> there was some super complex controls to match what he knew irl too

[2022-12-26 09:02:30] <@%PendrivE> yeah that's not really playable on controller
[2022-12-26 09:02:36] <@%PendrivE> some people would argue that it is
[2022-12-26 09:02:47] <@%PendrivE> but it's made for the wheel
[2022-12-26 09:02:52] <!Niezzer_> I only have a kb rn elisPain
[2022-12-26 09:02:59] <@%PendrivE> so it's kinda Pepega on a controller or keyb

[2022-12-26 09:08:13] <@%PendrivE> just feel like it would give me so much anxiety
[2022-12-26 09:08:17] <!Niezzer_> then i started playing it and it made more sense

[2022-12-26 09:08:43] <!Niezzer_> not anxiety but if you get a super op build early on you can pretty much just afk
[2022-12-26 09:09:17] <!Niezzer_> the game has a lot to offer but I dont think its suitable to most people
[2022-12-26 09:09:19] <@%PendrivE> maybe I will try it at some point then veiNodders

[2022-12-26 09:23:09] <@%PendrivE> switch can barely handle the game at 720p in docked mode? Welp it runs interpolated to 1440 or 4k on pc in 60 fps LULE
[2022-12-26 09:23:16] <!Niezzer_> so they can either go for a super powerful switch like console or split
[2022-12-26 09:23:35] <%+Nanu991> i played BOTW on cemu also, far better experiance
[2022-12-26 09:23:36] <!Niezzer_> my worse than average pc runs it better than the switch peepoGiggle

[2022-12-26 09:23:47] <!Niezzer_> and a switch here costs more than it

[2022-12-26 09:24:21] <%+Nanu991> i remenber how hard it was first emulating switch. time changes
[2022-12-26 09:24:21] <@%PendrivE> oh yeah, it's because people would keep asking what emulator etc
[2022-12-26 09:24:22] <!Niezzer_> emu
[2022-12-26 09:24:23] <!Niezzer_> lator
[2022-12-26 09:24:30] <!Niezzer_> oh
[2022-12-26 09:24:33] <!Niezzer_> doubt my pc can run a ps4 emu lator
[2022-12-26 09:24:37] <@%PendrivE> and since people are undeducated on the matter
[2022-12-26 09:24:42] <@%PendrivE> and most think emulators are illegal itself
[2022-12-26 09:24:50] <!Niezzer_> Classic
[2022-12-26 09:24:57] <@%PendrivE> it's just a tiring topic to bring up all the time and explain to each single person

[2022-12-26 09:26:03] <@%PendrivE> although nowadays I prefer to sort that out with SE
[2022-12-26 09:26:11] <@%PendrivE> since then I can see the message posted and the bot can be banned
[2022-12-26 09:26:11] <!Niezzer_> i get some whispers of scam bots sometimes

[2022-12-26 09:28:04] <%+Nanu991> discord worse
[2022-12-26 09:28:11] <@%PendrivE> yeah way worse
[2022-12-26 09:28:19] <!Niezzer_> you can literally upload files to discord so i can see why
[2022-12-26 09:28:28] <@%PendrivE> horny morons joining "nudes" server because someone posted it in a server
[2022-12-26 09:28:34] <!Niezzer_> i can literally just upload a keylogger LULE
[2022-12-26 09:28:42] <@%PendrivE> "bot" asks them to scan QR code with discord app to "prove they are human"
[2022-12-26 09:28:47] <!Niezzer_> nudes? where BOOBA
[2022-12-26 09:28:53] <%DistilledHoney> seen underage nude server scams too veiDespair
[2022-12-26 09:28:55] <@%PendrivE> and they get their account yoinked, since QR code bypasses 2FA and password
[2022-12-26 09:29:11] <@%PendrivE> and then their account is used to spam the same link in all the servers they are in
[2022-12-26 09:29:16] <@%PendrivE> and the chain continues
[2022-12-26 09:29:22] <!Niezzer_> SMH
[2022-12-26 09:29:38] <!Niezzer_> the youtube bot problem too
[2022-12-26 09:29:43] <@%PendrivE> so sometimes we get 2-3 people banned a day for posting the link, because their account is yoinked
[2022-12-26 09:29:47] <!Niezzer_> the difference is that youtube does nothing about it
[2022-12-26 09:29:55] <!Niezzer_> @PendrivE wtf

[2022-12-26 09:30:21] <@%PendrivE> and yeah better don't scan any qr codes with apps on your phone
[2022-12-26 09:30:27] <@%PendrivE> since you can get into steam like that now too
[2022-12-26 09:30:39] <@%PendrivE> most apps allow it nowadays
[2022-12-26 09:30:53] <!Niezzer_> i wonder why even have that if theres so many people getting scammed by it
[2022-12-26 09:30:54] <@%PendrivE> it's convenient, too bad people use it for nefarious reasons too Clueless
[2022-12-26 09:31:02] <!Niezzer_> hmmm
[2022-12-26 09:31:16] <%+Nanu991> there was that loading image one when if you just viewed it, bang, details gone
[2022-12-26 09:31:34] <!Niezzer_> id rather make something a bit less convenient in exchange having less of my users scammed
[2022-12-26 09:31:36] <@%PendrivE> well those are mostly urban legends

[2022-12-26 09:31:45] <@%PendrivE> 99% of the time if someone gets their discord hacked
[2022-12-26 09:32:04] <@%PendrivE> it's because they either scanned the qr code or actually logged into a phishing website that looked like discord
[2022-12-26 09:32:05] <!Niezzer_> i saw an image on my discord and now they have my bank details CRY
[2022-12-26 09:32:11] <!Niezzer_> what to do CRY
[2022-12-26 09:32:12] <%+Nanu991> ha, think it did turn out not real
[2022-12-26 09:32:20] <@%PendrivE> with discord it's kinda fucked as well
[2022-12-26 09:32:25] <@%PendrivE> since if someone yoinks your account
[2022-12-26 09:32:27] <!Niezzer_> phishing is fucked dude
[2022-12-26 09:32:29] <@%PendrivE> they see your payment details
