Here's a list of what things do: Channel points = 15 object thrown, Bits = 1 - 10 objects thrown, Gift subs = 19 objects thrown per 1 gift sub. Bits and Gift Subs push me off the screen

[2022-12-03 01:34:26] <%+ztmackin> @cerberus0alpha Deadspace was better, the new game is less so because it heavily punishes you for not doing melee vs deadspace which is just fun times
[2022-12-03 01:34:27] <@%Draconyite> @LightninRaiden and THIS right here, all it's making me do while watching it, is go play DEAD SPACE LUL
