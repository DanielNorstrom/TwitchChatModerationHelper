[2023-01-03 15:56:59] <MunchMunchie> @Axel_tv i find tarkov funny in that sense because once youve played for a set amount of time you just know sometimes when someone is cheating

[2023-01-03 18:24:00] <%rattrap_yt> depends, generally between 5-8% sales taxes
[2023-01-03 18:24:03] <28183232> Tax varies by state
[2023-01-03 18:24:03] <+Kleptokalvin> usually not food, some states do though
[2023-01-03 18:24:10] <+Cantu237> 10% tax typically
[2023-01-03 18:24:11] <bbc_correspondant> no... we have vat and it is included
[2023-01-03 18:24:12] <%Qweets> @max5602 really depends on your PC specs
[2023-01-03 18:24:18] <%rattrap_yt> depends, but usually only unprepared food isn't taxed
[2023-01-03 18:24:21] <%p_mob> i bought a coffe maker at walmart for 99UDS it was a peace of shift man
[2023-01-03 18:24:24] <+Cantu237> california is around 11% i believe
[2023-01-03 18:24:25] <bbc_correspondant> same in UK
[2023-01-03 18:24:28] <%rattrap_yt> something like candy would be taxed

[2023-01-03 18:24:54] <PsdOffElephants> i wish america was like that. atleast in certain states like in mine, food isnt taxed so if its 3.50 for 2 apples its gonna be 3.50

[2023-01-03 18:25:02] <junkieanimorph> Yeah like the price would be “9.99+Tax”= 10.81
[2023-01-03 18:25:10] <hypedfuture> How’s the raids been? Think aug is better then mdr? Tax here is 7%
[2023-01-03 18:25:12] <%+da_bruninator> Price + tax + tip = out the door
[2023-01-03 18:25:15] VIEWERS: 616
[2023-01-03 18:25:20] <%+otacon237> just the tip
[2023-01-03 18:25:22] <%rattrap_yt> yeah, restaurant meals are taxed, I don't think it's clear whether tip is pre or post-tax, I think traditionally pre-tax
[2023-01-03 18:25:27] <+nasty_nath> in australia we added goods & sales tax to products in the late 90's but still the advertised proice is the total price dont havr to math the tip and tax lol
[2023-01-03 18:25:27] <junkieanimorph> I don’t tip if I have bad service lmao
[2023-01-03 18:25:27] <%bubble_d> Where I live, approximately $15
[2023-01-03 18:25:34] <%Qweets> @max5602 you could try it out but only 70 on customs means you'll probably have not so good frames on streets.
[2023-01-03 18:25:41] <nebulae87> Total + Tax (varies by state) + Tip (15% stanard)
[2023-01-03 18:25:41] <junkieanimorph> That’s why I use Uber cause I can tip if they actually do a good job
[2023-01-03 18:25:50] <junkieanimorph> In NA we have a choice
[2023-01-03 18:25:52] <+Cantu237> not always
[2023-01-03 18:25:52] <%rattrap_yt> tipping isn't like... clear
[2023-01-03 18:25:53] <28183232> You don't have to tip, no.
[2023-01-03 18:25:53] <%bubble_d> Tips are NOT included in NA
[2023-01-03 18:25:57] <%tomme7331> @Axel_tv can u mod the AUG so its usable? or nah
[2023-01-03 18:25:59] <%Qweets> @Axel_tv Tips aren't included here in US
[2023-01-03 18:26:02] <yomultex> its by choice
[2023-01-03 18:26:09] <+max5602> @Qweets okay xD not sure if i download it again then^^ is it atleast fun?
[2023-01-03 18:26:11] <%rattrap_yt> US tips are never mandatory unless it's a restaurant policy, generally based on large parties only
[2023-01-03 18:26:15] <+Cantu237> tips are encouraged and frowned apon if you dont lol
[2023-01-03 18:26:15] <%+otacon237> I thinknit depends which place you go to, and it depends on the party size. if it's a large party then it vecomes compulsory
[2023-01-03 18:26:19] <%Qweets> @max5602 yeah it's great :)
[2023-01-03 18:26:23] <%+da_bruninator> some restaurants will include the tip (gratuity) on the bill.
[2023-01-03 18:26:26] <hypedfuture> Na wages are based off tips depending you don’t have to tip, I tip less if it’s shitty service
[2023-01-03 18:26:27] <vincent20017> by choice nut expected no?
[2023-01-03 18:26:30] <+Cantu237> SOME places WILL AUTOMATICALLY force tips
[2023-01-03 18:26:30] <@%ImSoBurr_> some restaurants will include it in the bill, especially with large parties @Axel_tv
[2023-01-03 18:26:35] <+dr3pie> they twist your arm to tip basically
[2023-01-03 18:26:37] <%bubble_d> Tips are culturally mandatory because Servers in the US get paid far below minimum wage
[2023-01-03 18:26:37] <%+otacon237> you are more or less expected to
[2023-01-03 18:26:42] <iSnipeLikeJesus> Yea cause most people tip and you will 100% get called a scumbag and piece of shit if you don't
[2023-01-03 18:26:42] <%p_mob> sometimes it is very rerely tho
[2023-01-03 18:27:05] <hypedfuture> I’d want to tip the chef anyways the people bringing me the food should make minimum wage
[2023-01-03 18:27:07] <Kasiimir_> u havent played much?
[2023-01-03 18:27:12] <yomultex> same
[2023-01-03 18:27:12] <+matchttv> @Axel_tv no you don't tips aren't included. tipping isn't even a thing outside of the usa. the USA just has some stupid point of views lol i dont tip lol get a better job if you wanna have an issue with not getting a tip lol

[2023-01-03 18:27:15] <@%ImSoBurr_> I don't believe in tipping for bad service. I will tip for adequate or good service
[2023-01-03 18:27:16] <iSnipeLikeJesus> Don't come to NA. They'll get you
[2023-01-03 18:27:20] <%Jib____> Bosses should pay their workers properly, then tips would be for exceptional service again.
[2023-01-03 18:27:21] <%+otacon237> lol we are the opposite, my parents are from soviet union always tip super minimal or none
[2023-01-03 18:27:29] <%rattrap_yt> US, not tipping is bad form because servers aren't paid shit
[2023-01-03 18:27:40] <+Kleptokalvin> everytime I think about tips I think about that scene in Resevoir Dogs
[2023-01-03 18:27:47] <%rattrap_yt> tip min wage is $2.13 still
[2023-01-03 18:27:47] <%+otacon237> the way server pay works in US axel, let me explain:
[2023-01-03 18:27:48] <@%$GigsTM> NODDERS
[2023-01-03 18:27:53] <+get_it_hahn> the only tip axel gives, makes babies
[2023-01-03 18:27:58] <hypedfuture> Find a different job is what I say 😂
[2023-01-03 18:28:01] <%bubble_d> But your servers get paid a livable wage right? in the US they get like $4/hr when minimum is like $13
[2023-01-03 18:28:04] <@%ImSoBurr_> GigsTM 4 cheaters in a row on shoreline Gladgers
[2023-01-03 18:28:06] <junkieanimorph> Lmfao be a good server or give good service and you’ll deserve the tip
[2023-01-03 18:28:12] <@%Par4doXon> @rattrap_yt and whos fault is that lol.. corporate greed is forcing the common people to pay more for nothing? fuck that shit KEKW
[2023-01-03 18:28:15] <%+otacon237> servers get paid LESS than minimum wage, because tips are expected.
[2023-01-03 18:28:15] <%rattrap_yt> US service industry/tip culture is bullshit
[2023-01-03 18:28:19] <%+KraljSrba> you need like 4 keys

[2023-01-03 18:28:41] <%rattrap_yt> oh I agree, I think servers should be paid fair wages and tips should really be optional/rare for good service/whatnot
[2023-01-03 18:28:50] <%+otacon237> and if you don't get enough tips to get you to minimum wage, the employer is supposed to pay up the difference

[2023-01-03 18:29:14] <PsdOffElephants> i hate the things where it says to tip cuz minimum wage is $2. By federal law they are supposed to be paid federal minimum wage, not state minimum wage. So if a waitress didnt get enough in tips by the end of her pay period by law the restaurant has to pay her as if she was paid the federal minimum wage per hour

[2023-01-03 18:34:33] <PsdOffElephants> federal minimum wage is 7.25 so in a 40 hr week youd get 290 before taxes. if anyone doesnt make the 290 in tips the restaurant needs to pay them enough to reach the 290. ive seen hella restaurants and roofing compaines get sued and have to give back pay.

[2023-01-03 18:34:59] <%rattrap_yt> @PsdOffElephants this is true, but minimum wage of $7.25 also isn't survivable
