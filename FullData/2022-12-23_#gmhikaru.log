[2022-12-23 02:57:23] <@%^Moobot> @MrYellow8666 Hikaru'll obviously try and get into the 2023 Candidates but there's 7 spots available and every top-50 player wants one. Hopefully he can qualify through whichever of the events are feasible in his schedule, the GCT has two of them already!

[2022-12-23 02:58:35] <@%^Moobot> @MrYellow8666 Hikaru's playing the Speed Chess Championship Semifinals tomorrow vs Nihal Sarin Pog If he wins he'll probably play Magnus in the Finals! ðŸ’¥ He'll then be Playing the World Rapid and Blitz in Kazakhstan December 25-30 ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡¿
