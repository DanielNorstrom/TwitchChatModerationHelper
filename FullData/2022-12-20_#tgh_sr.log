[2022-12-20 09:00:03] <RizTheWizard> the tracker likely isn't doing this @Cryten0

[2022-12-20 09:03:04] <RizTheWizard> oh heck it actually was the tracker. my bad, I assumed otherwise
[2022-12-20 09:03:08] <@%^Nightbot> Follow TGH on Twitter!  http://www.twitter.com/tgh_sr
[2022-12-20 09:03:10] <%iamanissue> if he has storage, deleting stuff shouldn't help that much
[2022-12-20 09:03:25] <RizTheWizard> Although I've seen multiple other people running emerald on turbo with the tracker? that's why I assumed otherwise
[2022-12-20 09:03:26] <%Cryten0> might have some looping logic
[2022-12-20 09:03:27] <%endrift> oh I wonder if this is because Emerald is a more CPU-intensive game
[2022-12-20 09:03:44] <%endrift> there's a bug in Pokemon Emerald that makes it use 100% of the GBA's CPU at all times
[2022-12-20 09:03:55] <%endrift> It's not present in Ruby or Sapphire and I don't think it is in FRLG either
[2022-12-20 09:04:04] <RizTheWizard> wait is that actually true lmao
[2022-12-20 09:04:08] <%endrift> yeah it is lmao
[2022-12-20 09:04:11] <RizTheWizard> LUL
[2022-12-20 09:04:18] <%+Darkrai_the_Reaper> It wasn't in FRLG for sure
[2022-12-20 09:04:22] <%endrift> There's a workaround for it in mGBA, but it's disabled in BizHawk
[2022-12-20 09:04:26] <RizTheWizard> I did not know that :)

[2022-12-20 09:04:46] <%endrift> It's possible to fix it in a patch

[2022-12-20 09:05:03] <RizTheWizard> well, the *slight* good news is that the tracker team is working on mgba support lol
[2022-12-20 09:05:09] <%HUGHmungous> what's the bug I just got here
[2022-12-20 09:05:33] <TushAvi> Congrats on the FRLG dub :D
[2022-12-20 09:05:42] <%endrift> No, it actually is good that it's disabled in BizHawk; the workaround reduces accuracy of the emulation
[2022-12-20 09:05:44] <taytaylortv> Why not just play then?
[2022-12-20 09:05:59] <%$AnimatedElf> what map do you use for the trainers and items?

[2022-12-20 09:19:20] <%HUGHmungous> I think this game gives you a lot of pivot opportunity if I'm remembering right
[2022-12-20 09:19:32] <%HUGHmungous> should be up to the forest who's name I've forgotten
[2022-12-20 09:19:42] <%+Versher777> Emerald is a different beast.
[2022-12-20 09:19:52] <%Izandai> Because there's more trainers, but of lower level, than in FRLG, right?
[2022-12-20 09:19:55] <$光の狐太郎 (hikari_no_kotaro)> Ralts <3
[2022-12-20 09:20:01] <%HUGHmungous> right yes that's it
[2022-12-20 09:20:15] <%Cryten0> how far away is your first rival fight?
[2022-12-20 09:20:18] <%iamanissue> needs more hp tbh
[2022-12-20 09:20:27] <%$ShenkBros> tail glow and two physical moves mmmm
[2022-12-20 09:20:28] <%HUGHmungous> @Izandai apparently the emerald kaizo boosts the trainers by 60% as opposed to 50%
[2022-12-20 09:20:46] <%HUGHmungous> so that you can actually reach steven at level 100
[2022-12-20 09:20:57] <%Kembro> Oh! Did that Porygon2 beat FRLG?? tghHappy

[2022-12-20 09:21:32] <%HUGHmungous> @Izandai yeah my memory is that FRLG is unique in terms of sheer quantity of trainers
[2022-12-20 09:21:34] <%Ralthien> Tubthumper Beff Jezos
[2022-12-20 09:21:52] <+sorrychangedmyname> is our goal to go all the way in Emerald too?
[2022-12-20 09:21:56] <%Izandai> Oh there's fewer trainers in this game than in FRLG?
[2022-12-20 09:22:05] <%Izandai> I thought there were more but they were lower level.

[2022-12-20 09:24:01] <+sorrychangedmyname> "fight me nerd..." can't be original
[2022-12-20 09:24:02] <%Izandai> Okay I had never seen Wartortles Emerald sprite before and uh
[2022-12-20 09:24:03] <JonDBS> I got confused with emerald kaizo especially with the last year's nuzlocke challenge LUL
[2022-12-20 09:24:04] <%Izandai> wow
[2022-12-20 09:24:07] <%Izandai> That's a hell of a stance.
[2022-12-20 09:24:09] <dries247> that sprite is uhm....

[2022-12-20 09:24:13] <%Ralthien> From what I recall, Amber did have problems setting Emerald up because they had high CPU usage.
[2022-12-20 09:24:23] <ThePlumberHimself> wait did you beat the FRLG kaizo?
[2022-12-20 09:24:24] <%Kembro> I always preferred Emerald to FRLG. Possibly for the very biased reason that I like the Pokemon movement animations. LUL
[2022-12-20 09:24:32] <%KweenChi> OMG WE GOT PAST MAY
[2022-12-20 09:24:37] <%KweenChi> SQUEEEE
[2022-12-20 09:24:38] <%HUGHmungous> I assumed it was similar to Ruby and Sapphire but emerald has 130 more trainers than R/S

[2022-12-20 09:36:09] <%$ShenkBros> @Iceblue I thought about this the other day and came to the conclusion it should be called automasochism

[2022-12-20 09:36:22] <%+Gameaholic2D> Cheer250 Just a heads up, you may not be familiar with this dangerous move, but the Bulk up is known to abruptly sweep teams.  Just thought you should keep an eye out on that move, oh wait sent the wrong warning to the wrong trainer.

[2022-12-20 09:37:41] <%endrift> @TGH_sr I just finished making that patch. When you're done with this seed, try applying it to the base ROM (after backing it up) to see if it fixes it
[2022-12-20 09:37:45] <%endrift> I posted it in the discord
[2022-12-20 09:37:46] <%+SheepTalk> well, that was anticlimactic

[2022-12-20 09:39:44] <%endrift> correct, it changes nothing else, though it may affect RNG stuff and the like if you care

[2022-12-20 09:39:52] <%endrift> due to internal changing of timing in the game

[2022-12-20 09:41:08] <%endrift> @Izandai there's a bug in Pokemon Emerald that makes it use 100% of the GBA's CPU at all times
[2022-12-20 09:41:16] <%Izandai> Huh. Weird.
[2022-12-20 09:41:17] <%endrift> so it makes the game run slower in emulator
[2022-12-20 09:41:29] <%endrift> or more accurately, more intensive to emulate at full speed
[2022-12-20 09:41:30] <Ionic_Iris> she's not in vanilla pretty sure

[2022-12-20 09:42:09] <%Izandai> Reminds me of how the RNG doesn't initialize properly when you boot up Emerald. Because they literally just dummied out the function to do it.
[2022-12-20 09:42:17] <Tiluvien> congrats for your win !
[2022-12-20 09:42:20] <%endrift> yeah, probably the same culprit tbh
[2022-12-20 09:42:20] <%Izandai> If it evolves into a special attacker...

[2022-12-20 09:49:57] <%Izandai> Wait, with +60% levels shouldn't that first encounter be level 3? Or is that straight-up a level 1 encounter vanilla?

[2022-12-20 10:05:40] <mjbrosxf> So basically you do the same challenge, with another game, right? :)
[2022-12-20 10:05:49] <nightbringer57> Is mega drain legal in the first fight here? (like in the lab fight for FRLG)
[2022-12-20 10:05:57] [Raid] 27 raiders from teddyras have joined!
[2022-12-20 10:06:04] <%DrMaple> There's actually a difference in this game choosing Brendan or May.
[2022-12-20 10:06:06] <Momirstar> grats, it seemed like a really solid mon
[2022-12-20 10:06:15] <ocyc> @nightbringer57 no but it is legal in the rival fight

[2022-12-20 10:06:49] <%iamanissue> isn't it 4096
[2022-12-20 10:06:51] <%mewmore> congrats on beating frlg yesterday!!
[2022-12-20 10:06:52] <%englishmc> when did you start the kaizo attempts? was it May?
[2022-12-20 10:06:56] <%Izandai> 4092 was the winning seed.
[2022-12-20 10:06:56] <$teddyras> love me the funny duck
[2022-12-20 10:06:57] <%sadib100> i don't know what makes 4092 special
[2022-12-20 10:06:57] <%Mirby_Studios> yeah 4096 is the relevant number
[2022-12-20 10:06:59] <%mizukibara> well the frlg code is based on ruby/sapphire and emerald is the most advanced version of Gen3 code scripts
[2022-12-20 10:07:00] <%+HateFilledDonut> @TGH_sr congrats on the win, just watched the vod :D
[2022-12-20 10:07:01] <+ALackofPants> that's 4096 you're thinking of

[2022-12-20 10:07:43] <$teddyras> I was doing a pokemon mod for dark souls 3, so time to watch more pokemon :3
[2022-12-20 10:07:44] <thelargeone> it's still a satisfying number
[2022-12-20 10:07:47] <Datlossit> Wasn't Emerald released after FR/LG?
[2022-12-20 10:07:56] <$pizza_for_free> Being well versed in computer number, I can understand the confusion, tbh
[2022-12-20 10:08:00] <%sin_pyro> If a mod wants to update the TMs, command, the gym TMs in Emerald are TM39, TM08, TM24, TM50, TM42, TM19, TM04, TM03
[2022-12-20 10:08:03] <+michaelchany> @Datlossit yes, Emerald 2005, FRLG 2004
[2022-12-20 10:08:06] <Datlossit> No wonder
[2022-12-20 10:08:17] <Resuu> I kinda like the nidoking.
[2022-12-20 10:08:27] <Cariyaga> I look forward to seeing you run gen 4+ and seeing how you handle the phys/special split with attacks
[2022-12-20 10:08:38] <~%TGH_sr> !addcom !emeraldtms TMs in Emerald are TM39, TM08, TM24, TM50, TM42, TM19, TM04, TM03
[2022-12-20 10:08:39] <@%^Nightbot> @TGH_sr -> The command "!emeraldtms" has been added successfully.
[2022-12-20 10:08:39] <$Wrenzo> Yo just watched the end of the last run cause I fell asleep! Grats!
[2022-12-20 10:08:41] <Datlossit> Gen4+ is gonna be interesting once ya get there
[2022-12-20 10:09:01] <TushAvi> is there any difference in mechanics between these gen3 games?
[2022-12-20 10:09:03] <+michaelchany> Emerald is forever GOAT for the PC duplication glitch
[2022-12-20 10:09:08] <ocyc> 1/4 not bad

[2022-12-20 10:09:19] <%Izandai> So, Teej. On the topic of rival AI. Normally the rival uses smart AI. But in the Rustborough rival fight, if Brendan is the rival and you chose the middle or right ball at the start, he'll use the dumb AI for that one fight.

[2022-12-20 10:09:36] <%Izandai> So if you wanna give yourself a slight advantage, you can play as a girl and never take the left ball.
[2022-12-20 10:09:43] <%fyraell> Do you like Emerald soundtrack btw ?

[2022-12-20 10:10:43] <%DrMaple> @izandai It's left or right ball if you choose May as your character
[2022-12-20 10:10:45] <+michaelchany> the Battle Frontier alone is probably pretty advanced, especially with the item duplication glitch that was found out
[2022-12-20 10:10:51] <%+Silverrain64> SeemsGood
[2022-12-20 10:10:51] <%Izandai> At least, so far as I know that's real. People were talking about it in Reimi's stream last night. Here's a pastebin showing the AI code for all the rival fights: https://pastebin.com/wHkQS41q

[2022-12-20 10:11:43] <+michaelchany> however the international release did remove e-Reader so you can only get Eon Ticket by mixing records; you can't directly connect it.
[2022-12-20 10:11:46] <%Izandai> @DrMaple Oh, the [TRAINER_BRENDAN_ROUTE_103_MUDKIP] section refers to which starter the player chose, not which starter the rival has?
[2022-12-20 10:12:06] <nightbringer57> I'm pretty sure bugs are intended to be part of those games tbh
[2022-12-20 10:12:07] <%DrMaple> @izandai Yeah, I messed up and messaged Reimi about it lol
[2022-12-20 10:12:08] <%stupidcooper33> did you move to emerald after a FRLG win?
[2022-12-20 10:12:15] <%Izandai> Ah, okay, good to know.
[2022-12-20 10:12:24] <%Int90> And that move will win the run.

[2022-12-20 10:12:54] <%DrMaple> @endrift Yeah
[2022-12-20 10:12:55] <%Izandai> Yeah, but it's left or right ball to get the dumb rival AI, not middle or right.

[2022-12-20 13:35:40] <%HUGHmungous> definitely a lot more variance in early game exp in emerald than FRLG

[2022-12-20 14:10:51] <+murixbob> Have you considered trying the Ironmon Kazio league thing that Spike is a part of? From what I gather people all play the same 100 pack of seeds and always pick the same ball. They get points for things like beating the rival and gym leaders

[2022-12-20 14:32:49] <OzelotlGames> it does look more ice like. fun fact, "sui" is one of the readings for the kanji for water :)
