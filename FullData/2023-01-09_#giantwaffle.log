[2023-01-09 18:30:18] <%maimvice13> you can get away with a normal craftingterminal until tier 4 or 5
[2023-01-09 18:30:18] <n00rman_> also eventually you want that to be passively made and sent off

[2023-01-09 18:33:16] <%+brenner1265> Is this something that you can automate using a crafting card?
[2023-01-09 18:33:22] <%+Markus11982> you can automate the miner on demand
[2023-01-09 18:33:30] <tomey36> Just limit it
[2023-01-09 18:33:31] <deadgolfer> time for ore washing side quest
[2023-01-09 18:34:06] <kane1941> better if there is 0 of some ore than send a new one
[2023-01-09 18:34:09] <%+brenner1265> Or can you use it like the drawers, once a resource is needed, it then sends the miner?
[2023-01-09 18:34:09] <n00rman_> me level emitter for low ilmenite = send micro miner
[2023-01-09 18:34:15] <Alyad> my ocd...
[2023-01-09 18:34:17] <+sorefingers> i think autocrafting the microminers with ae will gum up your crafting cpus
[2023-01-09 18:34:21] <%Littleme02> you might need to put a void on all of them, since you might need one ore much more than the others
[2023-01-09 18:34:28] <%maimvice13> @piiixxx i think at the moment the is still nobody that have achieved to this day at the new difficulty

[2023-01-09 18:37:17] <%+daedmissica0> and need chests
[2023-01-09 18:37:18] <%matori666> @sailorws Mix usually
[2023-01-09 18:37:23] <kane1941> better to do like "if there is 0 of one of the ores then send a new drone"
[2023-01-09 18:37:33] <her0zer0> @meller127 yes he is voiding he byproducts. not the pristine matter
[2023-01-09 18:37:34] <+WARHERO322> The drone requires chest too
[2023-01-09 18:37:37] <+sorefingers> i think it autooutputs
[2023-01-09 18:37:48] <%maimvice13> @piiixxx and it would take him a half a year to get to the waiting statge
[2023-01-09 18:37:52] <+xDeadBringerx> @daedmissica0 You run into power supply issues with P2P. It can only do so much power per tick
[2023-01-09 18:37:54] <Intohimos> You should only be inserting when requesting ore
[2023-01-09 18:37:57] <%mechoriet> @SailorWS seperate KEKW cause my autism can't handle mixed shit
[2023-01-09 18:38:17] <kane1941> make a patter to make ores from miner
[2023-01-09 18:38:18] <+jmm548> void what ?
[2023-01-09 18:38:18] <%DaemonSzyman> void what?
[2023-01-09 18:38:20] <+xDeadBringerx> What is that ticking noise? almost like a geiger teller
[2023-01-09 18:38:22] <%Littleme02> you probably will
[2023-01-09 18:38:26] <deadgolfer> yes, you will. Just do big stacks and then void
[2023-01-09 18:38:26] <PureSpider> SailorWS mix that shit all together peepoFat
[2023-01-09 18:38:28] <@%$SailorWS> mechoriet are you the type of person where different types of food cant touch? I have a buddy that does that
[2023-01-09 18:38:31] <%Littleme02> but also put huge upgrades on it
[2023-01-09 18:38:31] <+ns0z> max upgrade drawers. You should be good
[2023-01-09 18:38:33] <smash_mint_> process + compact
[2023-01-09 18:38:34] <$Stillglade> yeah, drawers for each with voids

[2023-01-09 18:38:52] <+JimTheShark> Isn't there a way that you can process things through a specific set of systems based on the name of the item?
[2023-01-09 18:38:55] <CoolReal> What if you need a byproduct
[2023-01-09 18:39:12] <+JimTheShark> You could set up an auto ore system and have it processed into useful things
[2023-01-09 18:39:15] <Ghandus> hey @Giantwaffle are you hyped for ksp2?
[2023-01-09 18:39:17] <+sorefingers> you could make a minerroom with the drawers attached to each tier of miner
[2023-01-09 18:39:21] <%DaemonSzyman> Galena is very useful
[2023-01-09 18:39:22] <%DaemonSzyman> for indium
[2023-01-09 18:39:30] <n00rman_> galena is crucial
[2023-01-09 18:39:36] <n00rman_> save it
[2023-01-09 18:39:41] <%bobolpwnz> you need galena
[2023-01-09 18:39:45] <n00rman_> purified
[2023-01-09 18:39:49] <+xDeadBringerx> Yeah, Galena -> Indium
[2023-01-09 18:39:54] <@%$SailorWS> monkaS
[2023-01-09 18:39:55] <%+brenner1265> Might as well process it out of the raw ore once you get it
[2023-01-09 18:39:57] <%mechoriet> @SailorWS touch is fine for me but I generally do eat then in a order like finish the meats then the potaters then greens
[2023-01-09 18:39:58] <%DaemonSzyman> Galena plus Sphalerite = Indium
[2023-01-09 18:39:58] <Intohimos> Cretes with emerald upgrades cost you nothing so you should store as much as possible
[2023-01-09 18:40:00] <@%$SailorWS> theres someone behind you
[2023-01-09 18:40:01] <%DaemonSzyman> yes
[2023-01-09 18:40:03] <weightmaker> zinc is also a byproduct i believe
[2023-01-09 18:40:09] <kane1941> you need billions of every ingot
[2023-01-09 18:40:11] <drsnaki96> washed galena i think
[2023-01-09 18:40:12] <%DaemonSzyman> Its a main dust in EV+

[2023-01-09 18:40:24] <%matori666> @sailorws relax, it's just my cat
[2023-01-09 18:40:24] <%DaemonSzyman> Purified Galena and Purified Sphalerite make Indium concentrate

[2023-01-09 18:40:34] <%Littleme02> is there an easy way to check if the drawers all a half full or less and then send the drone if one of them are. Then just put void upgrades on them all. That way you never run out of a thing and also don't get full

[2023-01-09 20:53:52] <Qbertman> dont u just need one automation crafter? why not just send like one micro miner
[2023-01-09 20:53:52] <%+GoodOldXijan> what its getting way more complicated? crazy
[2023-01-09 20:53:57] <deadgolfer> handcraft miners
[2023-01-09 20:53:59] <%silv> sounds good :)
[2023-01-09 20:54:00] <IAmJester> the miners are absolutely going to be faster
[2023-01-09 20:54:01] <%bobolpwnz> you can gen platinum grp sludge from tetrahedrite ore which comes from T3 drone
[2023-01-09 20:54:06] <%DaemonSzyman> Both are valid solutions, just depends on what resources you got
[2023-01-09 20:54:12] <+rofl1436> just send one miner
[2023-01-09 20:54:23] <kafenaisu> @giantwaffle this is the time to team up
[2023-01-09 20:54:27] <deadgolfer> miners definitely faster
[2023-01-09 20:54:36] <+rofl1436> do the miner YEP
[2023-01-09 20:54:37] <IAmJester> you're trying to make a loaf of bread by piling up bread crumbs when you could just bake a loaf in the first place.
[2023-01-09 20:54:41] <Qbertman> just send a miner to make the automation crafter
[2023-01-09 20:54:44] <DarkbuilderX> The chem reactor route is totally bait, unless you want literally all of the byproducts
[2023-01-09 20:54:56] <%DaemonSzyman> Miner is faster, chemistry is more of a long-term gain of iridium
[2023-01-09 20:54:58] <+WARHERO322> Dont you have 2 stacks of this stuff already the 8020
[2023-01-09 20:54:59] <+CommanderUrsus> do both stockAgain

[2023-01-09 22:10:16] <@%$Apparentthreat> @Giantwaffle can't you use multiple energy input hatches to overvolt and get faster speed?

[2023-01-09 22:11:16] <%DaddyDiddy> you can only do one recipe at a time so you only need 1 output hatch waffle

[2023-01-09 22:12:53] <InternetPlumber> the hatches / bus is for size and speed
[2023-01-09 22:13:10] <Bulltank> not speed, no

[2023-01-09 22:38:38] <jdude20202> HSLA is a lighter steel that is still strong (i think)
