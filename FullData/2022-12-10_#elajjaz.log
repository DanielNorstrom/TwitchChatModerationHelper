[2022-12-10 13:22:23] <%Vortalization> so Serperior work, I don't know much about Sawsbuck
[2022-12-10 13:22:23] <%Thatsa_Bruh_Moment> i could maybe suck it dry with leech seed and OMEGA drain like 4th gym elaG

[2022-12-10 13:37:40] <%Vortalization> @Thatsa_Bruh_Moment, decent idea, Electabuzzes give Speed EVs so it's good for most pokemons
[2022-12-10 13:37:46] <%$ToxicBurrito> elaFeels sorry friend dankHug
[2022-12-10 13:37:58] <%Thatsa_Bruh_Moment> oh i didn't know DankNoted
[2022-12-10 13:38:25] <%Thatsa_Bruh_Moment> i was thinking electabuzzes because they give most exp out of everything spawning there Okayge
[2022-12-10 13:38:54] <%Vortalization> @Thatsa_Bruh_Moment, I didnt either tbh, just checked bulbapedia. Right now, EVs aren't really your concern, but eventually, for the League, you will probably need to respec and grind them so your mons have perfect builds
[2022-12-10 13:39:58] <%iSilent_> I forget the town name but can probably grind the battle house in the 2nd town, the normal type guy gives a lot of xp
[2022-12-10 13:40:13] <%Thatsa_Bruh_Moment> ElaNOP im not doing that
[2022-12-10 13:40:22] <%Thatsa_Bruh_Moment> ElaNOP we'll get through

[2022-12-10 13:40:58] <%Thatsa_Bruh_Moment> yeah the battle house is nice too elaHmm
[2022-12-10 13:41:07] <%Vortalization> When you get access to route 13/14 grinding exp becomes MUCH easier
[2022-12-10 13:41:29] <%Vortalization> and in post-game even more
[2022-12-10 13:41:47] <%Thatsa_Bruh_Moment> i also decided not to use healing items so there's that Okayge maximum pain Okayge

[2022-12-10 14:31:53] <%Quifenadine> shame the pricing model on it
[2022-12-10 14:32:01] <%Quifenadine> pay 100 bucks for collectible version and not get the game
[2022-12-10 14:32:10] <%Quifenadine> games gonna be kraken scam
[2022-12-10 14:32:23] <MatriaxV> Yeah + Put awesome crusaders into your trailer but dont have a crusader class in the game Madge
[2022-12-10 14:32:29] <%$ToxicBurrito> dude that forspoken game ela demo'd yesterday is 80‚Ç¨ LULW
[2022-12-10 14:32:46] <%iSilent_> was it good btw, i had to leave and missed it
[2022-12-10 14:32:56] <%Quifenadine> it looked good imo
[2022-12-10 14:33:01] <%Quifenadine> but yeah the price is unjustifiable
[2022-12-10 14:33:01] <%$ToxicBurrito> gameplay seemed interesting, charactered yapped way too much
[2022-12-10 14:33:10] <MatriaxV> the world seems kinda empty
[2022-12-10 14:33:11] <%Xaimou> i think its good but its too donkTalk and cringe lines
[2022-12-10 14:33:20] <%Quifenadine> yapping is already turned down no?
[2022-12-10 14:33:26] <%Xaimou> no idea
[2022-12-10 14:33:28] <%iSilent_> yeah, one of the trailers seemed a bit Painsge so I was a bit turned off
[2022-12-10 14:33:37] <%Quifenadine> someone said that demo was old one given to journalists
[2022-12-10 14:33:45] <%Xaimou> i would play it though
[2022-12-10 14:33:51] <%$ToxicBurrito> oh elaISee
[2022-12-10 14:33:53] <%Quifenadine> and after the journalist feedback they turned down the yapping giga
[2022-12-10 14:33:54] <%Xaimou> seems a good game
[2022-12-10 14:33:57] <%iSilent_> 80 is just a lot though
[2022-12-10 14:34:03] <%Quifenadine> i like the nail idea
[2022-12-10 14:34:06] <%Quifenadine> liked
[2022-12-10 14:34:11] <%Quifenadine> quirky and interesting
[2022-12-10 14:34:17] <%Xaimou> but the game is too expensive
[2022-12-10 14:34:27] <%Quifenadine> NODDERS
[2022-12-10 14:34:28] <%Xaimou> i'll for it NODDERS
[2022-12-10 14:34:34] <%Xaimou> wait*
[2022-12-10 14:34:36] <%Vortalization> I wasn't a fan of the world in the game, seems like a generic high fantasy
[2022-12-10 14:34:45] <%Quifenadine> its an isekai
[2022-12-10 14:34:47] <%Quifenadine> what do you think
[2022-12-10 14:34:49] <%Quifenadine> PepeLaugg
[2022-12-10 14:34:55] <%Vortalization> well yeah, that speaks for itself LULW
[2022-12-10 14:35:12] <%Quifenadine> im saying that explains the generic high fantasy shit
[2022-12-10 14:35:16] <MatriaxV> what is an Isekai
[2022-12-10 14:35:31] <%Quifenadine> you basically get thrown into a different world
[2022-12-10 14:35:34] <%Quifenadine> weeb shit
[2022-12-10 14:35:46] <%Quifenadine> reincarnated, teleported, summoned whatever
[2022-12-10 14:36:17] <%Vortalization> FeelsDankMan well yeah, that's why I said "that speaks for itself" @Quifenadine
[2022-12-10 14:36:25] <%Quifenadine> Danki
[2022-12-10 14:36:53] <%Xaimou> i think forspoken is more portal fiction than a isekai
[2022-12-10 14:37:16] <%iSilent_> crisis core on the 13th elaHmm
[2022-12-10 14:37:17] <%Vortalization> what's portal fiction? elaHmm
[2022-12-10 14:37:26] <%Xaimou> basically transported to another world
[2022-12-10 14:37:32] <%Xaimou> similar to isekai
[2022-12-10 14:37:32] <%iSilent_> should be good
[2022-12-10 14:37:34] <%Thatsa_Bruh_Moment> DonkBonks AwakenedGarou don't miss rock slide you dingus
[2022-12-10 14:37:36] <%Xaimou> but not entirely same
[2022-12-10 14:37:37] <%Quifenadine> so its just isekai
[2022-12-10 14:37:43] <%Quifenadine> KEKW but the english word
[2022-12-10 14:37:46] <%Vortalization> FeelsDankMan explain how @Xaimou
[2022-12-10 14:37:58] <%Xaimou> since all the isekai i've seen or heard
[2022-12-10 14:38:06] <%Xaimou> is reincarnated to another world
[2022-12-10 14:38:14] <%Quifenadine> its not though
[2022-12-10 14:38:23] <%Quifenadine> theres a bunch of isekai that get teleported/summoned
[2022-12-10 14:38:29] <%Vortalization> ohh, I think both reincarnated/teloprted is in definition
[2022-12-10 14:38:38] <%Xaimou> i guess its the same idk
[2022-12-10 14:38:40] <%Xaimou> LuL
[2022-12-10 14:38:46] <%Quifenadine> Nerdge
[2022-12-10 14:39:33] <%Xaimou> just looked it up
[2022-12-10 14:39:38] <%Xaimou> i guess its just the same
[2022-12-10 14:40:51] <%Xaimou> but the term isekai is more known
