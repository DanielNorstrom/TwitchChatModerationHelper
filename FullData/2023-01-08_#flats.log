[2023-01-08 00:00:07] <$CMoocha> Flats if ive been a hog connoisseur since my first time playing in 2016 does that make me a bad person?
[2023-01-08 00:00:12] <Splosh0> @apexoxo69 cause she would be useless otherwise. It‚Äôs 5v5 now
[2023-01-08 00:00:13] <%$atsBrew> inb4 random chatter says just go ball or winston for widow Clueless
[2023-01-08 00:00:13] <%IrZKuma> @glitched_life it often resulted in a lot of long games that ended in draws that were really fucking annoying though too. its low point games were pretty much on the extreme end of rough
[2023-01-08 00:00:14] <Frost_Dragon00> Should have played around it

[2023-01-08 00:00:25] <%themariocuevas> Should Widow be more squishy? Like if she can one tap, people should be able to almost one tap her back(?) Opinions?

[2023-01-08 00:01:21] <Dewrand> And yet most streamers say 5v5 is better.
[2023-01-08 00:01:21] <PaladinSorceress> Do you think sniper meta on those maps would be counteracted if flanking heros like genji get buffed again at the hog rework later this month? Or still would they absolutely dominate?
[2023-01-08 00:01:22] <%+kungfukenny1855> lol
[2023-01-08 00:01:23] <%+JimmyGoneTwitch1> @flats so many fundamental problems with this game

[2023-01-08 00:06:52] <%LordHepipud> I think Widow itself is in  a very healthy state. Unlike Sojourn, you play far away and become vulnerable to flankers. And her hook has a 12s cooldown, which makes it not as oppressing than Sojourns movement. And she only really deals dmg when you hit shots at all
[2023-01-08 00:06:56] <apexoxo69> @flats HOW DARE YOU BETRAY WINSTON
[2023-01-08 00:07:04] <%infamous_paragon> @OverlordDavid 0.85 invincibility after the suzu, I believe. That's why it didn't work.

[2023-01-08 00:12:34] <%LordHepipud> @apexoxo69 I'm not saying it's hard to hit shots as Widow, you just need to practice. I would reduce her health to 175, which it was back in OW1 later on. But in general Widow itself is still in a very solid position, compared to Sojourn
[2023-01-08 00:12:35] <CollectingWelfare> @sahyko_ This is OW3 pre-alpha quick play

[2023-01-08 00:14:12] <%LordHepipud> @slendergamer2003 Ye I agree with that fully. But if you play Widow on a flank, you can even as Genji burn your cooldowns because in general there are no other teammates nearby. It's situational in my oppinion, but I agree with your points

[2023-01-08 00:20:09] <gordan127> genji is good if you do everything right
[2023-01-08 00:20:12] <Splosh0> Would be hard to buff genji when he dominates low elo
[2023-01-08 00:20:14] <tawwny> What do you think about the Brig buff?
[2023-01-08 00:20:14] <+adamftk> i think genji should have some of the nerfs reverted since they nerf'd dps passive but thats prob my copium

[2023-01-08 00:21:46] <+RaggyD> @surprisedrobin a middle ground is the dream, but it‚Äôs hard to gauge what that means or looks like
[2023-01-08 00:21:47] <%Suspect333> a buffed sombra would be hell on earth

[2023-01-08 00:21:55] <%+kaslwood> I think sombra should be taken out of the game LMAO
[2023-01-08 00:21:55] <%+rodenttft> Mei needs a nerf

[2023-01-08 00:21:57] <+naaasch> it's just sad the go-to flank hero is always Genji and not Sombra or Echo

[2023-01-08 00:21:58] <Spoodnix> makes the game boring and depressing
[2023-01-08 00:21:58] <antinex0> Pls REWORK Sombra. She can make the game miserable
[2023-01-08 00:21:59] <$rids800> just nerf genji, idk what why we arent
[2023-01-08 00:21:59] <%$atsBrew> hacked on cooldown as a tank is a great time YEP
[2023-01-08 00:21:59] <%+JimmyGoneTwitch1> i‚Äôm a sombra main and i think she need a rework
[2023-01-08 00:22:01] <%Strattekun> Sombra needs a rework to not be awful before she can come back
[2023-01-08 00:22:04] <+fewert> She has a time and place, doesn't need to be stong

[2023-01-08 00:22:15] <%SeanMunchie> agreed
[2023-01-08 00:22:19] <pineappleman_art> as a hog main, I totally agree that hog should be nerfed, I'm just worried their gonna nerf his tankyness, it's like the whole reason I play him
[2023-01-08 00:22:19] <+adamftk> sombra as a character is prob the most annoying comp, you have to dedicate sm to just take her out bc of TP
[2023-01-08 00:22:19] <bingchilling2333> !shoesize
[2023-01-08 00:22:20] <+Uulyaoth> sombra is the worst kit design in the game tbh
[2023-01-08 00:22:21] <+EastCoastPride> truers
[2023-01-08 00:22:21] <Salty_Scot> Giving Sombra no timer on invis was a mistake imo
[2023-01-08 00:22:23] <%$TankMittens> Sadge TeaTime
[2023-01-08 00:22:24] <xx_lynx18_xx> lowkey as a past sombra main she just needs a full rework
[2023-01-08 00:22:25] <+freakityfresh> Man I love playing OW as a game but the community is so toxic it makes me not play ranked
[2023-01-08 00:22:25] <walio21> hog too
[2023-01-08 00:22:28] <Xezc_17> the one tricks would crawl out
[2023-01-08 00:22:30] <+naaasch> then buff Echo
[2023-01-08 00:22:31] <hahaamerchant> Basically the game is not fun
[2023-01-08 00:22:31] <%+EradXX> imean honestly when any one character is hard meta the game isnt fun.. like all the time
[2023-01-08 00:22:33] <%mchsraider> sombra isn't fun
[2023-01-08 00:22:35] <%+Transphobiaphobic> i stopped playing overwatch 1 when sombras hack got buffed to stop lucios wall ride and stuff
[2023-01-08 00:22:36] <+O_Neros> i honestly believe that any multiplayer game goes to crap when a player can be invisible
[2023-01-08 00:22:40] <Nexallus> I have fun as doomfist and mercy though
[2023-01-08 00:22:40] <bagexx2243> @naaasch I hope you fall into a ditch you beach

[2023-01-08 00:22:46] <Ravendrel> i mean hog is miserable to play as and against
[2023-01-08 00:22:47] <%+kernul_> I like it only when she used to counter someone to help the team. Like taken care of a good ball
[2023-01-08 00:22:49] <ChrisTheMoney33> Fax
[2023-01-08 00:22:50] <Kuligon> Worst era of this game was bleed genji and scatterarrow hanzo
[2023-01-08 00:22:54] <thelastpatryn83> the problem with ow is about 1/3 of the crap in game doesn't belong in the game
[2023-01-08 00:22:54] <Mauserek> sombra is just a nuisance
[2023-01-08 00:22:55] <Spoodnix> league is way worse

[2023-01-08 00:22:59] <natsam2301> I have a lot of fun in ranked actually
[2023-01-08 00:23:00] <platformerkar64> I also agree with the Sombra thing
[2023-01-08 00:23:03] <%+sdcsly23> Smite was toxic af
[2023-01-08 00:23:04] <rached_mindfreak> fifa is the most toxic game
[2023-01-08 00:23:05] <SlySogeking> I think the matchmaker hates me KappaHD
[2023-01-08 00:23:05] <$freshestdougie> Sombra actively makes the game less fun. Abilities are the most fun part of the game and she impedes you from using them
[2023-01-08 00:23:06] <%+rodenttft> Nerf mei flatsBelieve flatsBelieve flatsBelieve
[2023-01-08 00:23:06] <%mchsraider> the abilities I hate are the ones that stop me from playing my character
[2023-01-08 00:23:08] <%MCDraws_> I feel like sombra should have a timer again, and make it so she can contest a point while invis like before
[2023-01-08 00:23:10] <@%AwCrap> Valorant and COD are so damn toxic
[2023-01-08 00:23:12] <Xezc_17> lol, dota, cs are just a few way worse than ow
[2023-01-08 00:23:12] <Splosh0> You think this game is toxic? Try siege bro holy shit.

[2023-01-08 00:23:23] <+BasenjiAoE> any game that relies on heroes being released will face these situations with power creep and toxic mechanics, unfortunately

[2023-01-08 00:23:25] <%$BodyOdor> Overwatch is far more toxic than most fps from my personal experience
[2023-01-08 00:23:25] <LandoCali> @bodyodor her ult should be reworked anyway. the fact that it's just the ability to use a normal ability faster is boring and shows how broken that ability is to begin with.

[2023-01-08 01:11:05] <@%^StreamElements> When Flats was in high school he joined the football team. Within his first week there, someone else on the team ended up crossing a line and pissing Flats off. Flats flattened the kid with his 6ft body, thus earning him the nickname "Flats" since "Flatten" sounds stupid.

[2023-01-08 01:35:24] <%sammcrank> @tjshell05 yea, bronze
[2023-01-08 01:35:28] <%a_witcher> @gordan127 because thats the ability
[2023-01-08 01:35:28] <Kuligon> @a_witcher if they just reduce her tankiness she'll be fine where she is
[2023-01-08 01:35:32] <%sammcrank> @tjshell05 not gold
[2023-01-08 01:35:38] <virendeluxe_bra> @a_witcher I feel like ult wont be changed because it going through shields does only slightly impact hog for example with sym and maybe with brig

[2023-01-08 01:39:02] <virendeluxe_bra> @a_witcher I agree but thats his thing. maybe reduce his dmg through shields a bit. And also his move speed in shift form because of the dps passive but now that thats gone it should go down to 105% because its a horror to supports that have no mobility. and those that doo have it aren't really influenced by it

Ik its for the Oneshot but arent the opponents chipped anyway because you shoot at them for charge or because everyone is fighting (Im garbage thats why im asking). Reason is because i think Ana is good vs Hog even with Kiriko since she cant cleanse Sleep and Anti Heal.

[2023-01-08 01:57:36] <1stplays> @Rego1704 I see the same argument being made by low rank players about Ana. Ana's nade just doesn't impact tanks anymore. Purple, even without cleanse, usually just gets healed up anyways. Pocket Sojourn is consistent oneshot, and even if you don't oneshot, she does so much damage with her gun.

[2023-01-08 01:59:56] <1stplays> @Rego1704 Just to note. Ana's counters are usually higher skilled heroes, which might be why she might feel strong. Learning to disengage when being anti'd makes Ana's nade useless. That's the most important skill to learn against her.
[2023-01-08 02:00:01] <%Stonks368> @Stonks368 Clueless idk Kapp
[2023-01-08 02:00:03] <%a_witcher> @virendeluxe_bra yeah somehow they will mess it up LUL but lets wait and see ^^
[2023-01-08 02:00:03] <%Rivgane> @a_witcher what? the season is two months, it started on december 6th so it will end somewhere in early february. so that means early january is the middle of the season. midseason patch is in the middle of the season. the "big changes" patch is everything they have pushed back from the midseason because its not finished because they went on holiday vacation

[2023-01-08 02:16:28] <virendeluxe_bra> @ambrosiatv maybe just explore more styles of cloothing that can indicate that but never ever talk about sexuality because the game isnt about that at all and everyone can belive in whatever they want

[2023-01-08 02:28:30] <%ThatOtakuInTheCorner> @savag3r101 Orisa is generally considered the best hog counter though cuz if he tries to vape, javelin, and you can help prevent one shots by displacing him with spear spin

[2023-01-08 02:28:46] <SkitzoCTRL> @gringlestimp Yeah, that's what I'm saying. You smell bad.  You're not good at smelling things. Your ability to sense smell is weak.
[2023-01-08 02:28:48] <virendeluxe_bra> @SkitzoCTRL I believe it will either be a nuke or kinda a buff because blizz missed te mark alot recently but it currently stands as a rework so we'll see
[2023-01-08 02:28:50] <gordan127> @toaster12343 probably not soon he is very unhealthy for the game

[2023-01-08 20:33:35] <underdog_0512> Pharah is like Reinhardt. C tier character because mobility is bad, rockets are slow and no splash damage, hitbox is massive and hit scans ruin her

[2023-01-08 20:34:07] <%+shpookie__> widow and hanzo are good because you need really good aim to one hit
[2023-01-08 20:34:07] <rabidraider19> you gotta hit shots with widow which takes skill. that's all she has. I can out sniper a bad widow with Mei

[2023-01-08 20:34:30] <EverydayEnby> So I have aquestion, a lot of yall say your team isn't the issues. But we have a 5 stack and one person that gets really agressive while playing and tries to command the whole game. He pushes too far ahead and screams about heals. It feels hard to play with him and I think it's going to be hard to rank up with him. Any advice here?
[2023-01-08 20:34:30] <digitalhadoken1> besides rein xd.. also who cares about owl .. shouldn't affect our games
[2023-01-08 20:34:35] <Rob_501> I don‚Äôt think agree on Zen being _pretty_ good tbh. He‚Äôs viable but there are better options
[2023-01-08 20:34:35] <mafiaferret_> Hog is losing the one shot in the rework? Is that true?
[2023-01-08 20:34:39] <TrmxZenny> does Moira have good healing and how do u feel about enemy Moira dps

[2023-01-08 20:35:45] <%+TrollALong> It's really the damage boost that is the problem not the DPS. I think MERCY needs a rework
[2023-01-08 20:35:47] <elgattozelatto> I, a sombra main but perm invis is stupid and should me changed
[2023-01-08 20:35:48] <stargriefer190> is it weird I semi like the new comp system?
[2023-01-08 20:35:51] <+robofluff144> I really hope they give doom a small buff and then leave him be, he is so close to being simply good and I can accept that, I don't want him OP

[2023-01-08 21:20:21] <@%^StreamElements> When Flats was in high school he joined the football team. Within his first week there, someone else on the team ended up crossing a line and pissing Flats off. Flats flattened the kid with his 6ft body, thus earning him the nickname "Flats" since "Flatten" sounds stupid.

[2023-01-08 22:20:13] <+Megatto> orisa's ult should make her fly and turn her into an attack helicopter

[2023-01-08 22:33:37] <%AnAbsoluteUnlt> @ace__balthazar i mean a threadripper is not made for gaming, a ryzen 9 would be better, as it is designed for gaming, so that may be why, also a 3070 ti with a threadripper, could also mean that the 3070 could be bottlenecking it
[2023-01-08 22:33:37] <%NattoXO> i also sweat SO badly the first few days of covid

[2023-01-08 23:40:06] <+ihassquidhat> @Flats just watched your new video on flats 2, I think all of the stuff in the vid is pretty true except the support role is mostly balance in comparison to eachother but the actual output and play potential in the game is way lower then anyone else. The way you do more then the other support is by not dying
[2023-01-08 23:40:09] <IxNVxU> is it just me or do Hog and Orisa feel very... not engaging?

[2023-01-08 23:51:26] <%GhostieEravela> I've been playing a buncha red dead online, it's real fun when you're not being griefed peepoShy
[2023-01-08 23:51:27] <jackstoningt0n> I tried playing the newest Dragon age, that was rough
[2023-01-08 23:51:33] <+AreWeClear> that was the first game iin that series I played (andromeda)
[2023-01-08 23:51:33] <+drglamm> Andromeda was not half as bad as people made out imo
[2023-01-08 23:51:36] <+Nynzy> There is a ME2 DLC that lets you remake (most) decisions from ME1 again~
[2023-01-08 23:51:37] <kiwibloke3> flats you can redo your decisions in a short animated cutscene
[2023-01-08 23:51:37] <IxNVxU> this is my take but I feel Orisa needs a full rework or be removed from the game entirely.
[2023-01-08 23:51:40] <robl97> play jq
[2023-01-08 23:51:41] <clam245> I was in a 5 stack in silver last night it was so much fun we won so many games teamwork does make the game great
