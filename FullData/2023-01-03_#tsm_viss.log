[2023-01-03 18:57:31] <%Snow_Trouble> One of the best improvements to Apex.. the removal of the self res. vissHAP
[2023-01-03 18:57:34] VIEWERS: 845
[2023-01-03 18:57:44] <Tranquilite> i think the general consensus is that self-res is too common and too quick
[2023-01-03 18:57:57] <%+codyphoto> @snow_trouble they did?!
[2023-01-03 18:58:11] <+manxycakes> Self res never works for me, I‚Äôm always killed during a self res, so I find it pretty useless lol
[2023-01-03 18:58:13] <JDF1RE> is lvl 250 max right now?
[2023-01-03 18:58:17] <%Snow_Trouble> @codyphoto Yes!!!
[2023-01-03 18:58:21] <%+Fl1cksh0tShep> @Tranquilite Agree. No problem with it. Just like you said, too fast and spawn rate is too high.
[2023-01-03 18:58:23] <%+codyphoto> Yeah self res is bs. And if they‚Äôre including it it shouldn‚Äôt stack. AND it‚Äôs too common.
[2023-01-03 18:58:28] <%+Gratchinsson> @Snow_Trouble i agree, it made the game so much better
[2023-01-03 18:58:34] <%Snow_Trouble> Hey @codyphoto when did you get the red badge?
[2023-01-03 18:58:47] <%Manpeckz> Maybe a non-stowable item.
[2023-01-03 18:58:48] <%+jcoons13> Only carry one self res at a time would be a good solution

[2023-01-03 18:59:02] <%+codyphoto> @snow_trouble 6 months ago or so! I‚Äôm almost at 5 years. Only a few months
[2023-01-03 18:59:04] <%+Fl1cksh0tShep> Cody appears to be 1 month into the red :)
[2023-01-03 18:59:15] <%Snow_Trouble> @gratchinsson not gonna lie though, COD would need some balancing in order to remove the self res or simply make it so you can only have 1, because it‚Äôs basically necessary.
[2023-01-03 18:59:19] <%+codyphoto> @fl1cksh0tshep I should be more than that no?
[2023-01-03 18:59:21] <%midnightmoonlightt> damn 6 months ago

[2023-01-03 20:49:05] <%ddot196> damn
[2023-01-03 20:49:34] <%Snow_Trouble> @ddot196 win 5 games in a row, on the next game you‚Äôll have the option to activate the quest. Once activated you have to gather 3 elements with debuffs (global position marked, constant damage over time aoe, and radar interference), in ring 4 the nuke spawns, you have to put the 3 elements in and activate it then protect it for like 2 minutes until it detonates.
