[2023-01-05 11:16:45] <%$shypotatoboy> The one thing I love about your original song is your voice. And what I mean by that is your accent is noticeable. To me, every Japanese/Asian song I’ve heard so far all sound the same. And by that, I mean it sounds like there’s no real difference between singers if that makes any sense. Sure, every singer sound different but yours stand out because of your Australian accent. And because of that, your song is so refreshing and something new to the table.

[2023-01-05 13:36:47] <%+soulwillin1997> I got bullied cos I had a moustache in Year 8 before the rest cos I had to stay back a year due to the principle not sorting papers properly
[2023-01-05 13:36:49] <DRAWING_DAEMON> I was the bully in school so
[2023-01-05 13:36:53] <%misterdonuto> I have worn dresses of all sorts as a dude. from maid uniform dresses to kilts to a wedding gown to a latex dress for cosplay. all people look good in dresses

[2023-01-05 13:37:33] <%primordealvoid> Some kids tried to bully me, I beat them
[2023-01-05 13:37:41] <%TheLastTriceratops> In primary school the big problem I had was that I was a slow eater and took about 30 minutes to eat my lunch. Several times, I agreed to hang out with my friends but they ditched me because I was still eating lunch and didn't show up. Then when I turned up to the place where we were supposed to meet, they weren't there. I didn't want to ditch them and it never occurred to me that they might have ditched me, so I ended up just standing there waiting for my friends for the rest of lunch
[2023-01-05 13:37:47] <%+soulwillin1997> at least I made some good friends that I still game with
[2023-01-05 13:37:50] <%primordealvoid> Oh look leet a clock

[2023-01-05 13:46:45] <Kardshark> Performance points (or pp for short) is a ranking metric that aims to be more contextually relevant to a player's progression in osu!.  It aims to shift the focus of skill progression from the amount of time played to an actual representation of the player's skill. This is attained by the calculation of a unique score known that is based on the difficulty of a beatmap and a player's performance on that beatmap.
