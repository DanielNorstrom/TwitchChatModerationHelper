[2022-12-11 08:08:33] <%StarsyNA> but that flexibility isn't worth 1 mana probably lol

[2022-12-11 08:29:30] <%StarsyNA> i think that they think that the kitsy "charm" of hearthstone is their major selling point
[2022-12-11 08:29:44] <littlemarmar69> But funny among us memes
[2022-12-11 08:30:05] <aramister> blizz has like 3 decades of stupid puns
[2022-12-11 08:30:57] <aramister> but hearthstone cards with flavor text is the pinnacle of that effort

[2022-12-11 08:36:05] <@%Tazny> I agree and I think a lot of people agree, but I guess theres a reason we arent successful business people and they are. Like at the end of the day, it must just make them more money to do it this way
[2022-12-11 08:37:01] <@%Tazny> Yeah thats true, its a very short sighted way of making money
[2022-12-11 08:37:05] <aramister> I guess they wanted to use this few months to better idea how to balance core for dk next rotation

[2022-12-11 08:39:26] <@%Tazny> It happens a lot, the original dev team that was passionate about it eventually get phased out and the products get worse. BioWare used to be my favourite game company but they're not even the same company anymore, just the same name

[2022-12-11 08:40:15] <%StarsyNA> it is strange though that I rememebr when they released DH there was literally not a single DH card that was bad by the standards of the meta.. DH had cards that had 0 representation in any decks that were better than the shit other classes had
[2022-12-11 08:40:52] <Kazoojisan> you don't think part of why they change so much is just listening to kneejerk feedback more?
[2022-12-11 08:41:16] <%StarsyNA> Like remember that 9/5 rush that turned into a 5/9 taunt when it died? never used in standard lol.. DK doesn't have anything like that

[2022-12-11 08:54:26] <@%Tazny> Its kinda cool because usually drafting is pretty mindlessly easy, but you can really mess up a dk draft

[2022-12-11 08:54:31] <%+draculaic2> all of constructed right now is aggro decks or snowball decks that are impossible to counter without exactly the right cards. I know, I know, play arena.

[2022-12-11 09:16:48] <mclerobe> Zeddy is a lot lol
[2022-12-11 09:16:58] <%+fiximol> no because HSreplay only pulls from deck tracker

[2022-12-11 09:17:26] <@%Tazny> Makes sense now that you mention it, it only records the results of games and retires dont play any games
[2022-12-11 09:17:36] <%gchlmp> Winrate can go down across all classes, not that weird

[2022-12-11 11:16:35] <%+d3vbr4h> I think Hearthstone's refusal to have in game stats is partly due to Blizzard trying to market the game as a "fun" experience and not necessarily a "competitive" one. similar to how Nintendo handles Smash Bros.

[2022-12-11 11:45:00] <KKhadgar> I think adding more and more tribes to BGs is a good thing, with the different set of minions every game. It can make more interesting combinations of synergies viable. "Okay, this game has undead, dragons, and pirates, what's good with that"
[2022-12-11 11:45:20] <Pissbeard> but its easier for them to just make random skins and sell them LUL

[2022-12-11 11:47:28] <KKhadgar> I disagree, I think it gets better the more tribes are in the pool, maybe just to an extent though. With a pool of 5, picking 3 has like what, 5 combinations? But if you have 8 tribes to pick 3 from, suddenly it's 27 combinations
[2022-12-11 11:47:37] <@%Tazny> I remember when it was a big deal that a new skin came out and everyone went wild for it, like the first Tyrande skin. Now theres like 10 new skins every update and they all suck

[2022-12-11 11:51:04] <%disssen> tft even when playing for the first time each season is super confusing @kkhadgar  I can see how it would be worse for a viewer
[2022-12-11 11:51:19] <KKhadgar> Yeah, Watching TFT would benefit from a twitch overlay like 1000%
[2022-12-11 11:51:28] <General_HAM> TFT is currently in Set or season 8, usually around 4/5 months theyll do a Set 8.5 and then Set 9 in another 4/5 months
[2022-12-11 11:51:30] <!%kingcharles__69> even when I know what I'm doing, its hard to understand what streamers are thinking when everything happens so fast
[2022-12-11 11:51:35] <KKhadgar> Being able to hover all the champs and items to find out what they do? üëå
[2022-12-11 11:51:37] <%disssen> but, I hit Plat already and the season started on Tuesday. so I'm up in it.

[2022-12-11 11:59:25] <KKhadgar> Just like hero-card reno's Poof, it wasn't a silence + kiill, it was "remove from game", so they werent even in ressurect pool
[2022-12-11 11:59:27] <+TillyVilly> i wonder if it keeps rush if you dont attack with the rush attack monkaHmm
[2022-12-11 11:59:37] <KKhadgar> @TillyVilly Yeah that's what I wonder

[2022-12-11 12:24:49] <KKhadgar> @black_cleric92 on standard, it's a deckbuilding mechanic. on arena, it's a drafting restriction.
[2022-12-11 12:25:03] <%moh_elkhatib> whats best combo of colors in your opinion?

[2022-12-11 12:25:47] <KKhadgar> Green is flood / tokens, red is removal, blue is attack spells (generally speaking, as architypes)

[2022-12-11 12:26:54] <KKhadgar> The best cards for DK arena (in my barely informed opinion) are the ones that say "discover a <something> rune card"
[2022-12-11 12:27:05] <!%treebeardhealz> not bad eatting a doughnut maybe play some OW
[2022-12-11 12:27:18] <KKhadgar> Because almost every rune card is stronger than every card without a rune, so discovering them are amazing discovers.
[2022-12-11 12:27:37] <%kaenni> get scourge and cast it
[2022-12-11 12:27:47] <%kaenni> satisfaction guaranteed
[2022-12-11 12:27:49] <plexecute> I played a discovered Marrowgar with 25 corpses.  It was insta-concede for the opponent
[2022-12-11 12:28:18] <General_HAM> The devs had SOME foresight when they made Army of the dead not give you additional corpses lol
[2022-12-11 12:28:25] <%+NExt__88> I honestly dont even know how the color mechanics work, can you explain them again?

[2022-12-11 12:29:02] <!%treebeardhealz> monkaS
[2022-12-11 12:29:02] <KKhadgar> @NExt__88 Some death knight cards have runes on them, between 1 and 3. Your deck is only allowed to have max 3 runes total. So if you draft a card that is 3 green, you can never get any red or blue cards.
[2022-12-11 12:29:08] <+darkruse_> @kaenni why draft it when you can discover it and play it on 7 with vezier SeemsGood
[2022-12-11 12:29:32] <mish___mash> @kkhadgar can you get 1 rune or 2 rune though?
[2022-12-11 12:29:41] <mish___mash> 1 green*
[2022-12-11 12:29:49] <%kaenni> darkruse_ that's the better way of getting it
[2022-12-11 12:30:01] <KKhadgar> Yeah, it makes a lot more sense in constructed
[2022-12-11 12:30:17] <%+NExt__88> So whats the ideal color combos right now to look for?
[2022-12-11 12:30:24] <%+NExt__88> thanks @KKhadgar
[2022-12-11 12:30:32] <%kaenni> blue/green imo
[2022-12-11 12:30:42] <KKhadgar> On constructed, when you are making a DK deck, it shows 3 empty slots above the decklist. if you put in a card with 1 blood rune, it fills one of the rune slots with a blood rune, and all the cards that are now invalid for you deck (3blue, 3green) become grayed out.

[2022-12-11 12:30:50] <Woodsyy11> How have I drafted 10 times and still not drafted a single Dk yet redbird :(
[2022-12-11 12:31:07] <KKhadgar> If you put in another card with 2 blue, yuor runes fill into 1 red 2 blue, and only cards that match are allowed. which in that example, would be 1 red, 1 blue, 2 blue.
[2022-12-11 12:31:28] <KKhadgar> Some of the strongest cards are 3 runes of a single type, but that also makes your deck the most restricted as to what cards you can put in.
[2022-12-11 12:31:35] <%kaenni> I had a bit more fun last meta

[2022-12-11 12:33:05] <%$Timihash> Is Dk busted?
[2022-12-11 12:33:07] <KKhadgar> For arena, there are rune discovers on 2 blue, 2 red, and 2 green, so i would recommend only locking in 2 runes with one of those cards, they are too good.

[2022-12-11 12:37:38] <@%Tazny> Yeah why did they do that I dont get it
[2022-12-11 12:37:39] <KKhadgar> I find the phrasing weird as well, it's just the distinction between counting the enemy's turn as well.
[2022-12-11 12:37:50] <%+NExt__88> gonna end up killing him with Deathlord SMOrc
[2022-12-11 12:37:53] <%kaenni> I found it intuitive bc it worked the way I thought it would
[2022-12-11 12:37:59] <+JoblessFr3ak> omg that deathlord value.
[2022-12-11 12:38:12] <@%+smellyhead> "this or last turn"
[2022-12-11 12:38:18] <%kaenni> could also read "in the last 2 turns"
[2022-12-11 12:38:25] <%lordoy0> it means it also counts if it died on your opponents turn i gues
[2022-12-11 12:38:29] <KKhadgar> But it's NOT last turn, it's only the enemy's turn, and then your current turn.
[2022-12-11 12:38:45] <KKhadgar> I think changing the word "after" to "since" would make it clearly, to me anyway
[2022-12-11 12:38:48] <%moh_elkhatib> wow it is hard to word it, maybe "the next 2 turns, your opponents and yours"
[2022-12-11 12:38:51] <%kaenni> usually reading the text in hs is not enough, but for this thing it is

[2022-12-11 12:40:24] <@%Tazny> So correct me if Im wrong, but its another way of saying "If an undead minion died on your opponents previous turn"?
[2022-12-11 12:40:37] <KKhadgar> I suppose they just wanted to differentiate it from nagas, elementals, beasts, dragons, etc. Nagas are "if you cast a spell with this in hand", elementals were "played last turn", dragons are "have one in hand" etc
[2022-12-11 12:40:40] <%kaenni> this turn or last turn

[2022-12-11 12:42:16] <KKhadgar> I think saying "recently" would work well, if when you hovered over the card it would explain more in depth what that means
