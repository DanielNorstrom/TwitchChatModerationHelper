Zidane at 5 is arguable you can put someone else there, Ronaldo 4th because of all the accolades.  (minus WC)

[2022-12-24 17:31:45] <@%BladeRunnerKing> @barkrufallo that squad has a lot of glaring holes and weaknesses, they were inspired by messi's greatness and a top form di maria, solid defense, but otamendi is older now, and there isnt many young talent to keep this momentum going. but then again anything can happen in 4 years
[2022-12-24 17:31:47] <%+iceyog__> @bladerunnerking cr7 and lm10 they changed football, they made 30 goals a season look cheap, made winning 1 or 2 ucl weak, made it look like if you don't perform for close to a decade, you don't even get mentioned in the GOAT debate. we'll probably never see anything like it anymore, El classico became WC finals
[2022-12-24 17:31:56] <daangey> but they have good players coming up in defense midfield and attack

[2022-12-24 18:04:19] <doughboy3141> I agree on both counts. The gulag is supposed to give you a fair, competitive shot at reentering the map. 2v2 really makes it more likely that a bad teamate will cost you the win

[2022-12-24 21:12:33] <%+Bradrr239> What do you all think that every 50 wins you get a nuke attempt (once they have stats) cause casual players like me ain’t winning 5 in a row lol
[2022-12-24 21:12:41] <rondofc1> whats good
[2022-12-24 21:12:42] <%+xSTEWDEEx> 200 bucks an hour is a solid wage for nuke runs

[2022-12-24 21:15:40] <+dkryptr> The only purpose is to get additional in-game content
[2022-12-24 21:15:43] <%Hidden_Ace91> Before shipment DMZ was an easy weapon booster.
[2022-12-24 21:15:47] <%+bigkenmiller> There is no incentive other than if they put a blueprint to extract
[2022-12-24 21:15:51] <+travytrav123123> lmao I actually feel like the exact opposite...if you lose in BR...you just go again
[2022-12-24 21:15:52] <+stevo2254> Lol the only reason is for the m13
[2022-12-24 21:15:54] <yikesuh__> i think its mainly for in game content
[2022-12-24 21:15:59] <+dkryptr> Everything you loot doesn't matter either. There's no market or use for it.
