[2022-12-11 16:28:24] <@%Grimstab77> @rin_narumi it really depends on the enemy team composition
[2022-12-11 16:28:37] <@%Grimstab77> Usually your dmg will be higher than mit
[2022-12-11 16:28:40] <@%Grimstab77> or equal

[2022-12-11 17:01:42] <KingofFables> wait does  twitch care about kill

[2022-12-11 17:01:54] <+pyromana192> my school used to have an overwatch team that got cancelled because the manager uploaded the scoreboard and the network service manager saw the word kill and reported it
[2022-12-11 17:02:06] <UndeadGraduate> 'i just took out both healers' is better than 'both healers are dead'

[2022-12-11 17:46:42] <%rin_narumi> he's good. he's balanced honestly. I feel like his shield is bad tho. like useless.

[2022-12-11 17:47:28] <@%Grimstab77> @rin_narumi if you use it correctly it's a very strong shield
[2022-12-11 17:47:34] <%rin_narumi> his ult and normal atk is good other than that I feel like his abilities are ok. his punches are good too.

[2022-12-11 17:48:30] <%rin_narumi> @grimstab77 Yea, that's true but the thing is it's very situational, unlike Sigma and Reinhardt who if they put up their shield at the wrong time they can recover. Ramatra is kinda hard to get that timing.
