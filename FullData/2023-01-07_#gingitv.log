[2023-01-07 14:35:55] <Chr0nicConsumer> outlaw is probably the best, but sub is also top tier
[2023-01-07 14:36:10] <NETRAV3R> it was tier and legendary taht made it good in SL
[2023-01-07 14:36:11] <torunom> @mysterious_guy Yes

[2023-01-07 15:04:49] <%+Teddsan> u cant get enough cp on 3 targets
[2023-01-07 15:04:50] <Kappadroid> Maybe something for bosses and just ignore on AoE
[2023-01-07 15:04:58] <+lalicich> guys listen to what he sayingh isntead of telling him. he cant get 2-3cp cause he gets max combopoints only aeverycast
[2023-01-07 15:05:11] <%Nymzeee> Does your combo point tracker track them as well?
[2023-01-07 15:05:25] <%Nymzeee> Ah yeh, does
[2023-01-07 15:05:26] <+plskniev> he can get low cp if unlucky with crits i tihnk

[2023-01-07 15:06:28] <+plskniev> Its the only viable option i think
[2023-01-07 15:06:33] <erabohmer> + stealth movement
[2023-01-07 15:06:33] <%Nymzeee> I guess only use it when facing up to number of mobs to give max CP with Fan?

[2023-01-07 15:07:09] <+Epixil> single target rly good
[2023-01-07 15:07:16] <%+Teddsan> why assa when sub exists
[2023-01-07 15:07:16] <dbrz> i love it but you need big pull
[2023-01-07 15:07:16] <Makenebun> assa for tiranycal
[2023-01-07 15:07:20] <+lalicich> @dbrz he cant get 7 cp rupture anyways  cause he cant hit 3-4cp for a max slap
[2023-01-07 15:07:20] <erabohmer> It absolutely pumps on ST, and can will be nuts with new AoE buffs.
[2023-01-07 15:07:22] <Pantist> maybe in 10.0.5
[2023-01-07 15:07:22] <+munkh_xd> try assa for weekly keys, would be fun to watch

[2023-01-07 15:08:15] <+lalicich> 6 isnt 7lol
[2023-01-07 15:08:16] <Pantist> outlaw overall will be allways higher than ass in dgs,  more balance in st and aoe
[2023-01-07 15:08:19] <%+Blueberi_> under rated but bad for cleave it's it's good at full aoe or full mono
[2023-01-07 15:08:26] <dbrz> you dont understand its fine bro
[2023-01-07 15:08:31] <ironmaiden256> could have potential at higher keys tbh, when stuff doesnt insta die @GingiTV

[2023-01-07 15:08:41] <Makenebun> think you should always envenom on reprimand combo
[2023-01-07 15:08:43] <+N00B_L0RD> u do
[2023-01-07 15:08:55] <Makenebun> it does the 7cp damage
[2023-01-07 15:08:56] <+N00B_L0RD> but its not like always 100% better than envenom
[2023-01-07 15:09:00] <+N00B_L0RD> there are times for it
[2023-01-07 15:09:03] <Makenebun> but does not give you rupture duration

[2023-01-07 16:13:03] <inteus82> @whiteiversen_  mm should e fine it just got 3 % nerf. doubt they will nerf them more
[2023-01-07 16:13:04] <Alliof> @xxtravert yeah but losing unerring vision for that is kind sad too
[2023-01-07 16:13:11] <+N00B_L0RD> set bonus is illegal for boomie

[2023-01-07 16:13:17] <totorio713> you hitting way more targets tho
[2023-01-07 16:13:20] <+Thoreya> onezy knew
[2023-01-07 16:13:27] <%+Sparda_67> boomkin without 4p is so bad
[2023-01-07 16:13:34] <+Spekky> think they finally fixed boomkin after underperforming for a few expansions now?
[2023-01-07 16:13:43] <%+Sparda_67> yhe up from 4p is insane
[2023-01-07 16:13:50] <YukiTrip> the only problem is how they swapped some talents for boomie, where it might lose a bit of its aoe baseline, but hoping for changes soon Cope
[2023-01-07 16:13:55] <%+Luscioo> UH DK with 421 gear must be also pretty insane
[2023-01-07 16:13:59] <%Rizavi> What do the talents look like?

[2023-01-07 16:17:13] <demazLol> Yeah but he was triggered that Boomy never got touched but rogue got touched because it was "outperforming everything" is what the developers gave as a note.. lol and he immediately hovered Onezy and was like What about this guy.. he tops every meter and he doesnt get anything xD
[2023-01-07 16:17:29] <%+Omeniaa> @vaeny Just do big keys an unholy thrives with high target cleave
[2023-01-07 16:17:35] <syku1> its just some classes flying under the radar
[2023-01-07 16:17:51] <+Vaeny> @Omeniaa I'm already doing like 22s but I need to pug and its gatekeeping hell PepeLaugh
[2023-01-07 16:18:00] <sadpant> shocker, only rogues don't agree that the entire class is outperforming in all content
[2023-01-07 16:18:01] <+SyMmBoLz> @GingiTV is Boomy getting a buff?
[2023-01-07 16:18:09] <+PMrD97> boomy doesnt even have a kick KEKW meanwhile rogue with the most utility in the game also topping meters and they cry when nerfed
[2023-01-07 16:18:11] <+Fudge__cake> I know you've already probably answered this 1000000 times so sorry to be annoying, but would your prio embelishments be helm + lariat?
