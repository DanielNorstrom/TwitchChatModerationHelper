[2022-12-11 13:28:00] <%Methaies> You go scenario into Peach into dana and have 75 points on board for no reason
[2022-12-11 13:28:29] <@%+xahverius> @Methaies no that much or I play it wrong lol

[2022-12-11 13:28:59] <prisioneroelectrico> what deck is more interesting to play from those?
[2022-12-11 13:29:09] <puzzle_express> @Methaies ye i was quite curious
[2022-12-11 13:29:09] <@%+xahverius> BAPreda still the quax version?
[2022-12-11 13:29:15] <%insilico_man> chat Peach is 12p?
[2022-12-11 13:29:21] <puzzle_express> to be fair i feel like dana first form is busted as fuck
[2022-12-11 13:29:32] <%sp1cy_gr> @BAPreda to me it doesnt seem that good because u only have 2 other relicts to play in that deck, and usually u quax into dana anyways
[2022-12-11 13:29:40] <%forsenWP> @insilico_man 13
[2022-12-11 13:29:47] <%Methaies> 2 is more than enough
[2022-12-11 13:29:58] <%insilico_man> MonkaW 13 is expensive
[2022-12-11 13:29:59] <%Methaies> if the horse lives its over
[2022-12-11 13:30:11] <%sp1cy_gr> but dont u want to quax into dana r1?
[2022-12-11 13:30:11] <%BAPreda> @xahverius yeah. only matchups i've lost so far are reavers & monke tactics shirru
[2022-12-11 13:30:12] <%sp1cy_gr> so for quarixis u wont have relicts other than leader
[2022-12-11 13:30:18] <@%+xahverius> I still not seen spyro's version of harmony, missed it Sadge
[2022-12-11 13:30:20] <%BAPreda> still far away from finishing placements tho
[2022-12-11 13:30:39] <%insilico_man> quax enjoyer Stare

[2022-12-11 13:30:57] <%Methaies> BAPreda I was able to beat it a few times with blaze of glory. You can leader the Peach and kill dana with boosted raids
[2022-12-11 13:30:59] <%BAPreda> @sp1cy_gr i've been using quax mostly for quarixis actually
[2022-12-11 13:31:08] <@%+xahverius> insilico quax so fun right now if they miss the evolve card KEKL
[2022-12-11 13:31:16] <puzzle_express> he just bait you to play your sentry front kekl

[2022-12-11 13:33:56] <%BAPreda> @Methaies sure but if i play quax onto quarixis onto leader while scenario is on the board i suddenly get 3 extra tags on the board in one turn. can't remove them all at that point

[2022-12-11 14:46:31] <%Mark_Loop> gwent is a terrible game (c)
[2022-12-11 14:46:34] <CaptainCaffeine1976> bushy streams gow and elden ring
[2022-12-11 14:46:34] <%Mark_Loop> YEP
[2022-12-11 14:46:39] <nemopants> you can get your first 10-20 viewers here YEP
[2022-12-11 14:46:44] <@%zubedoo> @insilico_man Nah its off season and I am not in the right place to stream rn
[2022-12-11 14:46:53] <shashank0034> are bushies streams popping off?
[2022-12-11 14:46:55] <%Mark_Loop> Kapp
[2022-12-11 14:47:03] <%insilico_man> my bushenko NOOOO his watch parties brought me back to gwont SadgeCry
[2022-12-11 14:47:04] <@%zubedoo> @shashank0034 with his youtube
[2022-12-11 14:47:07] <%Methaies> I think mosh is the best example for what you can achieve in gwent
[2022-12-11 14:47:07] <nemopants> @zubedoo 100 viewers easily Kapp
[2022-12-11 14:47:13] <juststfuplsty> when most of the big streamers do variety they lose like 90% of their viewers
[2022-12-11 14:47:13] <@%zubedoo> @nemopants KEKSure
[2022-12-11 14:47:15] <@hippotompotomus> yeah i guess the idea was that you build up a community that's interested in you and then have them when you switch games
[2022-12-11 14:47:19] <%insilico_man> @Methaies true
[2022-12-11 14:47:19] <juststfuplsty> big gwent streamers*
[2022-12-11 14:47:23] <shashank0034> @zubedoo wheres ur hundred viewers HamStare
[2022-12-11 14:47:31] <@%zubedoo> Bushy is literally hitting million viewers with Elden OMEGALUL
[2022-12-11 14:47:41] <juststfuplsty> @zubedoo on yt
[2022-12-11 14:47:44] <@%zubedoo> to him its an ez "fuck gwent I am done" scenario
[2022-12-11 14:47:53] <%insilico_man> i'm so happy for Bushy YAA
[2022-12-11 14:47:56] <@%zubedoo> @juststfuplsty yeah thats still a lot
[2022-12-11 14:47:56] <%Methaies> @insilico_man I was kinda bummed when mosh said on stream that gwont is not paying and he has to go back to work. true TrollDespair moment
[2022-12-11 14:47:59] <juststfuplsty> he averages about 400k per video now
[2022-12-11 14:48:05] <@%zubedoo> yup thats insane
[2022-12-11 14:48:14] <juststfuplsty> its not bad
[2022-12-11 14:48:17] <%Lulucienne> Bushy is a mega star now KEKWait
[2022-12-11 14:48:18] <%insilico_man> @Methaies KEKWait when did he say it?
[2022-12-11 14:48:20] <@%zubedoo> and Elden Ring is saturated af dont forget
[2022-12-11 14:48:25] <@%zubedoo> its not easy to do well there
[2022-12-11 14:48:31] <shashank0034> @Spyro_ZA you should try marvel snap imo. the audience seems fragmented there
[2022-12-11 14:48:32] <@%zubedoo> SOOO many big creators were doing content for it
[2022-12-11 14:48:45] <shashank0034> mtg would be very competitive
[2022-12-11 14:48:47] <%Methaies> @insilico_man he said it before october. But maybe something changed in his personal life tho
[2022-12-11 14:48:53] <juststfuplsty> its kinda the opposite because it was favoured in the algorithm a while back
[2022-12-11 14:48:58] <%Methaies> he kept streaming
[2022-12-11 14:49:00] <+NaLu_David> When do you plan on streaming another game and will it be split stream between or all in on new game ?
[2022-12-11 14:49:02] <juststfuplsty> so it was ez to get lots of views
[2022-12-11 14:49:14] <%insilico_man> @Methaies hopefully things turn for the better for him
[2022-12-11 14:49:20] <%Methaies> NODDERS
[2022-12-11 14:49:21] <testing_pred> bushy has moved on to bigger things now and we’re still hollowing with gwent KEKSociety
[2022-12-11 14:49:54] <CaptainCaffeine1976> what do you all think is the strongest ng deck is atm?
[2022-12-11 14:49:59] <%insilico_man> @zubedoo Bushy's YT content for ER is some of the best. and i say it as someone who has never played soul's games
[2022-12-11 14:50:08] <@%zubedoo> yeah he is great
[2022-12-11 14:50:10] <@%zubedoo> great ideas

[2022-12-11 14:50:42] <%JohnnyL0513> Is Enslave better than double cross?
[2022-12-11 14:50:43] <%Methaies> bushy is kinda my favorite twink NODDERS
[2022-12-11 14:50:44] <testing_pred> I’m personally not a big fan of this type of content but I can see the appeal
[2022-12-11 14:50:59] <juststfuplsty> he should try elden ring pvp content
[2022-12-11 14:51:16] <shashank0034> bushy is doing a lot hard content
[2022-12-11 14:51:24] <shashank0034> like beating gow on hardest without taking damage
[2022-12-11 14:51:28] <shashank0034> wtf

[2022-12-11 14:52:47] <%berdel__> @zubedoo but busy is not only a random player and streamer, I was watching his GoW gameplay and holy shit, this guy is a gigachad making all bosses hitless on the hardest mode
[2022-12-11 14:52:48] <%insilico_man> @Methaies Bro i feel you

[2022-12-11 14:53:03] <CaptainCaffeine1976> maybe the relaunching of the witcher will help a little.
[2022-12-11 14:53:07] <handsomeklain> cdpr has done nothing to promote gwent
[2022-12-11 14:53:08] <@+QuillandLance> your mom told me she joining gwent, thats all the growth i need FeelsOkayMan
[2022-12-11 14:53:12] <@%zubedoo> FeelsOkayMan
[2022-12-11 14:53:13] <bacel_of_rivia> I started Legends of Runeterra to ease myself in another type of CCG.. it's no Gwent but it seems fun
[2022-12-11 14:53:17] <juststfuplsty> yeah bushy surprisingly next lvl at those games
[2022-12-11 14:53:26] <%insilico_man> @sargonautilus explains the color of your name BlueBalls KEKW
[2022-12-11 14:53:46] <sargonautilus> KEKSure
[2022-12-11 14:53:47] <%+fullhaeuss> I wanted to look at LoR but the whole UI fried my brain
[2022-12-11 14:53:47] <shashank0034> @bacel_of_rivia legends of runterra is similar to gwent in terms of financials. its not making money, and receving fewer updates as a result
[2022-12-11 14:53:59] <shashank0034> runterra will die just like gwent HamStare
[2022-12-11 14:53:59] <%Methaies> bushy reminds me a lot of smallant if you guys know him

[2022-12-11 14:54:40] <@%zubedoo> @insilico_man all that is doing is making me buy a new GPU OMEGALUL
[2022-12-11 14:54:40] <+raptr0364> I really would like to see a game mode like Rogue Mage in Gwent , where you DRAW each turn
[2022-12-11 14:54:46] <$EwaldBrosodi> but that red line is an expectation, not aligned with actual numbers
[2022-12-11 14:54:46] <@%zubedoo> new players my ass OMEGALUL

[2022-12-11 14:55:02] <sargonautilus> also why did they announce it so early? it kinda made me even less willing to play gwent
[2022-12-11 14:55:10] <DarthMonkeyyy> try mtg arena
[2022-12-11 14:55:27] <%insilico_man> @zubedoo i will be jamming W3 NG on my laptops 2070Super Prayge

[2022-12-11 14:55:39] <sargonautilus> yeah at least until then
[2022-12-11 14:55:42] <%Methaies> gwent needed to do something drastic like HS did with Battlegrounds. Battlegrounds got me to play HS again for a year after i allready peepoExit ed the game
[2022-12-11 14:55:46] <Gedrox> meaning there wil no new cards ever right? only changes to old cards
[2022-12-11 14:55:47] <testing_pred> try elden ring, pull a bushy
[2022-12-11 14:55:48] <%insilico_man> yeah not waiting for w3 next gen is such a strange decision
[2022-12-11 14:55:50] <%Methaies> but there is no hope left now
[2022-12-11 14:55:52] <shashank0034> i didnt believe you when you told us gwent would die in a year or two.

[2022-12-11 14:57:27] <mickeyAD_> why not using mirror earlier? had like 3 engines on board
[2022-12-11 14:57:29] <shashank0034> you should try marvel snap. the viewerbase seems fragmented ( one streamer does not have all the viewers), and it seems popular rn @Spyro_ZA
[2022-12-11 14:57:43] <nemopants> i was hoping for vodanoi expansion with dagon but those hopes died long time ago Sadge
[2022-12-11 14:57:45] <Kessman5> will mr streamer play Gwent the whole 2023 and after?

[2022-12-11 14:58:49] <@%zubedoo> like the game can't do it
[2022-12-11 14:58:49] <%+fullhaeuss> so did the avengers game
[2022-12-11 14:58:51] <shashank0034> at least
[2022-12-11 14:58:53] <%Methaies> @Spyro_ZA did you have any exchanges with other strimmers? what are their plans?
[2022-12-11 14:58:54] <@%+xahverius> marvel snap seems boring to watch but probably cause I dont understand it
[2022-12-11 14:58:55] <Riivian> @shashank0034 so does marvel avengers and that game is Deadge
[2022-12-11 14:58:59] <%+oVagante> @Spyro_ZA The solution is to reset Elden Ring in 500 possible ways LUL
