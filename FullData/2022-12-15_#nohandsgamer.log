[2022-12-15 23:26:27] <+SnowMyzer> what did you cut for the watch posts
[2022-12-15 23:26:32] <%+Razorbam> You don't need quest if you have an egg
[2022-12-15 23:27:22] <%+yodacao> i swear everytime i play spirit guide i over draw
[2022-12-15 23:27:56] <%WezaRipoto> ive been really enjoying big spell mage
[2022-12-15 23:28:04] <DysenteryGary7> if put in quest is just card draw... you never win with quest
[2022-12-15 23:28:09] <tenaciousbe> @yodacao yeah same, i started to avoid playing it early if i can, so its not included in all the red pools
[2022-12-15 23:28:11] <ColonelBlabby> in the report they say they think this deck will end up being better i think its jsut that quest priest is easier and builds itself better
[2022-12-15 23:28:16] <tenaciousbe> res*
[2022-12-15 23:28:26] <%JonsyBones> EZ
[2022-12-15 23:28:26] <%+ikrebmart> So you're saying VS shouldn't put all of its eggs into one basket?
[2022-12-15 23:28:26] <%FatalVindicator> easy decks are also on average better decks. power level is important but so is ease of use. alongside matchup spread, those 3 attributes define a deck's overall winrate
[2022-12-15 23:28:29] <%Penguin_Edd> holy shit, this song was in fifa like 7 years ago, absolute bop
[2022-12-15 23:29:25] <tictac_hs> Yeah I'm pretty sure at least 1 spirit guide is core, still on the fence about 2
[2022-12-15 23:29:49] <tictac_hs> It's not sorted is it
[2022-12-15 23:29:52] <+KoalaBlast> @NoHandsGamer skip egg, go switcheroo, more draw to right minions, skip bad minions
[2022-12-15 23:30:02] <tictac_hs> Oh nvm

[2022-12-15 23:35:55] <+hilaryisthedevil> should your ladder matter
[2022-12-15 23:36:34] <xaybaybay> I prefer tourney over ladder

[2022-12-15 23:47:43] <%WezaRipoto> opponent concede = win condition
[2022-12-15 23:47:43] <@%littleballofhate> @NoHandsGamer But to your point, Mi'da is 100% a win condition, but it's slow and gradual, rather than single-turn crushing
