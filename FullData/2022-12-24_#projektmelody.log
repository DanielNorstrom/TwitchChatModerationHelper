[2022-12-24 11:31:12] <@%Mikulex> i also only draw like 3 or 4 times a year now and i guess that you can see that
[2022-12-24 11:31:32] <@%QuestionableHero> thanks (: i still enjoy drawing but i just havent been motivated
[2022-12-24 11:33:41] <@%Mikulex> It's more of a time thing for me

[2022-12-24 16:28:20] <Kagumiiin> mustirWut someone's about to swipe
[2022-12-24 16:28:49] <Kagumiiin> which server are you on ?
[2022-12-24 16:42:50] <@%Mikulex> US

[2022-12-24 16:43:06] <Kagumiiin> FeelsBadMan
[2022-12-24 16:43:11] <@%Mikulex> which one are you in
[2022-12-24 16:43:14] <Kagumiiin> EU
[2022-12-24 16:43:37] <@%Mikulex> is it worth or stupid to start another session in eu
[2022-12-24 16:43:48] <Kagumiiin> very stupid tbh
[2022-12-24 16:43:54] <Kagumiiin> it's way too much of a grind
[2022-12-24 16:44:04] <@%Mikulex> i never spent a single cent and i dont have that much content unlocked rn i think?
[2022-12-24 16:44:12] <Kagumiiin> what do you have
[2022-12-24 16:44:21] <Kagumiiin> and where are you in the story
[2022-12-24 16:44:24] <@%Mikulex> adventure rank 36, world level 4 if that helps you
[2022-12-24 16:44:26] <Kagumiiin> monkaHmm
[2022-12-24 16:44:55] <Kagumiiin> tcg is locked behind ar 32 or 34
[2022-12-24 16:44:59] <@%Mikulex> i dont even remember much of the story cause it was a while i last played properly
[2022-12-24 16:45:13] <Kagumiiin> in that case it may be worth revisiting
[2022-12-24 16:46:14] <@%Mikulex> i prolly just got to liyue or something storywise
[2022-12-24 16:46:21] <@%Mikulex> im done with mondstadt
[2022-12-24 16:47:50] <Kagumiiin> in that case it may be worth redoing it
[2022-12-24 16:47:51] <@%Mikulex> only thing that would prolly suck is that i wont have keqing
[2022-12-24 16:48:17] <Kagumiiin> you are guaranteed an early 5* from standard banner
[2022-12-24 16:48:43] <Kagumiiin> qiqi keq tighnari mona diluc jean

[2022-12-24 16:49:05] <@%Mikulex> yeah but how probable is it that i get keq
[2022-12-24 16:49:10] <@%Mikulex> cause shes fun to play imo
[2022-12-24 16:49:14] <Kagumiiin> she is
[2022-12-24 16:49:35] <Kagumiiin> and is actually way better than she used to be now because of dendro
