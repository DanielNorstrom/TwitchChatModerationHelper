[2022-12-16 00:25:11] <@%^StreamElements> I am struck by Panic. My shackles are shattered by Panic, and it grants me total emancipation. I embrace my Panic. It envelops and consumes me. Through it, I become Panic Personified! And where Panic thrives, there grows Freedom! But we must accept: The cat-streamer is gone forever.

[2022-12-16 06:03:02] <@%^StreamElements> I am struck by Panic. My shackles are shattered by Panic, and it grants me total emancipation. I embrace my Panic. It envelops and consumes me. Through it, I become Panic Personified! And where Panic thrives, there grows Freedom! But we must accept: The cat-streamer is gone forever.

[2022-12-16 06:03:16] <@%^StreamElements> I must not panic. Panic is the mind-killer. Panic is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my panic.

[2022-12-16 13:42:03] <@%^StreamElements> I must not panic. Panic is the mind-killer. Panic is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my panic. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the panic has gone there will be nothing. Only cat-strimmer will remain

[2022-12-16 14:30:16] <@%^StreamElements> I am the fear of my panic. anxiety is my body, and fright is my blood. I have survived over a thousand jumpscares. Unknown to calm, nor known to composure. Have withstood poise to create many dreads yet those hands shall never hold anything. so, as I pray, unlimited panic works

[2022-12-16 19:19:05] <@%^StreamElements> I am the fear of my panic. anxiety is my body, and fright is my blood. I have survived over a thousand jumpscares. Unknown to calm, nor known to composure. Have withstood poise to create many dreads yet those hands shall never hold anything. so, as I pray, unlimited panic works

[2022-12-16 20:51:56] <%+snakeandwolf7> right
[2022-12-16 20:51:56] <WhyWorry07> I've heard the same thing about Shakespeare
[2022-12-16 20:52:01] <%Dragonator_g> That must be why it's so difficult for art critics to properly identify the artist of some pieces.
[2022-12-16 20:52:02] <%$earin_copper> There are still aspects of it in academia
[2022-12-16 20:52:03] <%Moon_feral> That is practically what happens at times in academics when a "lab" research is published

[2022-12-16 20:52:09] <%+H7bridsigh> mhrm!
[2022-12-16 20:52:13] <%ynlokk> Renaissance era artworks are usually done by a team too, and not a single artist
[2022-12-16 20:52:14] <+Skeletalgoose> Its like reposting other ppls art today except without a power relationship
[2022-12-16 20:52:15] <@%$zMiyuZ> art was a weird thing at the time
[2022-12-16 20:52:22] <%mitnakaesh> it feels like if someone was getting  "paid in exposure" today but their work isnt even being credited so no actual exposure
[2022-12-16 20:52:30] <+ArgonFalcon> sort of like how if someone commissions an artist the idea belongs to the person commissioned it?
[2022-12-16 20:52:34] <EthanPierce0318> OH! I think I get it now. It was loooong before Copyright was invented.
[2022-12-16 20:52:34] <%+snakeandwolf7> LOL
[2022-12-16 20:52:36] <%+bluedude153> But enough about AI art :v
[2022-12-16 20:52:39] <friscoborn> remember: artists were seen as craftsman: like carpenters and bricklayers back then
[2022-12-16 20:52:39] <%Melancholy_mage> I credit DM for being being marginally less bitter at the universe.
[2022-12-16 20:52:46] <misermark> Interesting, it makes sense, I think I get it, still feels insidious in a way.

[2022-12-16 20:53:29] <%vic_weave> it was akin to doing lab work under a supervisor
[2022-12-16 20:53:35] <regolith__> in my art school when you won a cash prize for some artwork, some % was taken by the school, that was not very nice :)

They appear as young women and use their enchanting beauty to tempt humans in spiritual training and cause their downfall. Apsaras take Gandharvas as their mates, but are also known to marry human males. They are said to carry the souls of those who die in battle to heaven, where Indra, the god of thunder, awaits them. In the Indian epic "Ramayana." they are called Apsara.
