[2023-01-10 17:09:17] <@%^Moobot> @nice__csgo Hikaru's ring was forged from the gold decorations of the family's samurai sword which dates back almost 1000 years and is a family heirloom which has been surgically attached to Hikaru's hand at age 20. Rumors have it that since he's the single most successful Nakamura in history, he will be buried with it, at sea, in a Belgian viking burial.

[2023-01-10 18:53:59] <%+DocEducation> @wrisles I don't know all the neurology but something about plasticity in the brain... to get to GM you have to hit the training hard as a young kid up to like 18 or so... if you're not GM by then it's statistically almost impossible...
[2023-01-10 18:54:00] <%+oKPI> i still think it's very impressive that the mother in Queen's Gambit was the only person to ever adopt Beth Harmon.
