[2022-12-10 17:27:38] <sipharty3> that's why he re-stamp the blueprint continuosly, each time something get researched "you stamp" the recipe on those empty machines
[2022-12-10 17:27:43] <%thedoh> So from A to B, which is handy if both A and B share ingredients (such as chemplants and oil drills)

[2022-12-10 19:31:09] <%warsoul88> if you're building outposts with bots and they're idle for quite a long time sometimes, did you think about like a robo network expansion blueprint? so you could stamp it on the side of the base where future outposts will go?
[2022-12-10 19:32:57] <%devjock> Maybe some blueprints with powerlines plus roboports?
[2022-12-10 19:33:06] <%devjock> just for spamming away from mainbase

[2022-12-10 19:39:53] <%devjock> ah okay
[2022-12-10 19:41:38] <pantaboo> might want to ckear the steel base that backing up to get a clearer picture

[2022-12-10 19:47:22] <pantaboo> fast inserter?
[2022-12-10 19:48:51] <pantaboo> but how would you put the coal there?
[2022-12-10 19:49:13] <pantaboo> why not splitters with prio?
[2022-12-10 19:49:19] <pantaboo> @AntiElitz
[2022-12-10 19:49:25] <%warsoul88> try copying the exact same thing to 2 tiles above, that may fix the issue
[2022-12-10 19:49:58] <pantaboo> then splitter is the same issue
[2022-12-10 19:50:00] <%warsoul88> by buffering few pieces of ore before letting them to 2 last inserters

[2022-12-10 20:01:30] [Notification] TIFF3RT subscribed with Prime.
[2022-12-10 20:01:57] <%TIFF3RT> Thx for your content <3
[2022-12-10 20:06:13] <pantaboo> what issue are you working on rn? did you fi the steelfurnaces, if so, how?
[2022-12-10 20:06:59] <pantaboo> how did you fix the steelfurnace issue?
[2022-12-10 20:09:29] <pantaboo> do you posssibly bufffer gc or redc somewhere?
[2022-12-10 20:11:21] <pantaboo> one belt misin
[2022-12-10 20:11:41] <pantaboo> oh, that was on purpose
[2022-12-10 20:13:11] <%sipharty3> @thedoh is this the command? /perf-avg-frames [tick amount]
[2022-12-10 20:13:19] <%sipharty3> i use it but nothing appears Kappa
[2022-12-10 20:13:24] <%sipharty3> need to be in multyplayer?
[2022-12-10 20:13:55] <pantaboo> maybe repurpose some of the iron buffer to steel or something (handfed)
[2022-12-10 20:14:29] <%simrock> what's the signal on the yellow?
[2022-12-10 20:14:33] <pantaboo> the wire on the belt
[2022-12-10 20:14:52] <SingularityApoc> what is the inserter capacity at this point?
[2022-12-10 20:15:18] <%simrock> 1
[2022-12-10 20:15:27] <pantaboo> why hold it? shouldnt enabling the inserter be neough if its backing up?
[2022-12-10 20:16:37] <Elwendir> i think this belt was placed by bots
[2022-12-10 20:17:33] <%torrentialecho> looks like you didn't place the inserter
[2022-12-10 20:18:43] <tagrv> bots fix the inserter
[2022-12-10 20:20:56] <drommedarius> wheres the timer
[2022-12-10 20:23:15] <pantaboo> that seems to happen in the last times? something similar happend to me
[2022-12-10 20:23:44] <pantaboo> maybe outpost train is overloaded?
[2022-12-10 20:23:53] <poepklodder> You can normally trace all problems down to a single source
[2022-12-10 20:23:55] <poepklodder> !why
[2022-12-10 20:23:55] <@^Nightbot> Why did Nefrums do this?

[2022-12-10 20:24:37] <tertioni> Evening chat, what is being debugged?
[2022-12-10 20:25:25] <pantaboo> inserter stacck size?
[2022-12-10 20:25:29] <tertioni> An outpost taking more belt than it needs? Outrageous!
[2022-12-10 20:25:34] <pantaboo> when it has 156
[2022-12-10 20:25:39] <pantaboo> and it puts in 5
[2022-12-10 20:25:43] <%sipharty3> yea it's stack size
[2022-12-10 20:26:18] <%sipharty3> the signals take time to go forth and back
[2022-12-10 20:26:22] <%sipharty3> it's not instant
[2022-12-10 20:26:29] <raside1> Use Helmod?
[2022-12-10 20:27:06] <%sipharty3> also...
[2022-12-10 20:27:09] <%sipharty3> !blamenefrums
[2022-12-10 20:27:09] <@^Nightbot> Why would Nefrums do this?
[2022-12-10 20:28:25] <%sipharty3> 158 now LUL
[2022-12-10 20:30:54] <%sipharty3> tick , signals go to counter, tick , process, tick, goes back and stops the inserters (while inserter is still going)
[2022-12-10 20:31:43] <pantaboo> thats interesting
[2022-12-10 20:32:11] <%sipharty3> if you want 156, put 154 limit Kappa
[2022-12-10 20:32:22] <%sipharty3> or i mean 152 idk
[2022-12-10 20:34:52] <%sipharty3> unreachable station acquired Pog
[2022-12-10 20:36:12] <pantaboo> why not include anough bots to only have them fly once each. so the train can leave imidiately
[2022-12-10 20:36:25] <pantaboo> then they recharge only when the train is gone
[2022-12-10 20:37:03] <%+prof_lesmis> Hello, hello. How is it going? Still gonna do a run, or only debugging left?
[2022-12-10 20:37:24] <%sipharty3> warm up run done, we are waiting for the real deal Kappa

[2022-12-10 20:39:24] <pantaboo> maybe add circuitry if it also placed miners and stuff? to not have it leave early
[2022-12-10 20:39:29] <%devjock> hmm, good christmas gift idea; Gamer gloves
[2022-12-10 20:39:38] <%sipharty3> you are doomed then elitzCry @devjock

[2022-12-10 20:49:03] <mmmkkaaayy> @AntiElitz maybe you can reconnect the outpost to the global network after it's built, to reclaim the bots (and send more in the train)
[2022-12-10 20:49:40] <mmmkkaaayy> ah, cool
[2022-12-10 20:50:16] <%seky16> hey, will you do another run today?
[2022-12-10 20:50:27] <mmmkkaaayy> it's hard to estimate the value of idle bots waiting/travelling in a train vs non-idle bots flying across the map
[2022-12-10 20:50:39] <%sipharty3> AYAYA massive multiplayer soon, in 10mins @seky16

[2022-12-10 20:55:07] <%Squabblol> have you found different areas where you need to slow down/do earlier since you're going faster consistently?
[2022-12-10 20:55:51] <%sipharty3> depends also on the map
[2022-12-10 20:55:58] <%sipharty3> if you find a forest slowing you down etc

[2022-12-10 21:00:04] <Sir_Oranje> Whats the issue, are those too intensive to build?
[2022-12-10 21:00:05] <%sipharty3> nope, but he placed rails 1 step before in blueprint
[2022-12-10 21:00:17] <%sipharty3> so that uranium train will be built instantly
[2022-12-10 21:00:19] <mmmkkaaayy> it feels like the issue is remembering to start the train, no?

[2022-12-10 22:24:42] <BiBaButzeBenne> are the other bases using the same blueprint? can you check where the frames are getting GCs from?
