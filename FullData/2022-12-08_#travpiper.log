[2022-12-08 16:33:07] <%TylerSensei> @travpiper I'm going to say it, it's honestly gatekeeping the roleplay.

[2022-12-08 16:43:14] <+Seetherrr> @boolove I think a lot of them.  I was watching someone kind of new to the server and he was upset he would get chased by cops for driving a stolen car while speeding and running red lights.  Even funnier is he never considered just pulling over when the cops turned their lights on.
[2022-12-08 16:43:14] <%buddha_hands> hes also a pathological liar lol

[2022-12-08 18:13:03] <d0ttti> @larsbrunkhorst The search of the vehicle, but Wrangler can frisk the guy and get his gun. But he still had a license so in hindsight if u go by 100% legal moral route, there was nothing.

[2022-12-08 19:26:58] <Colden226> I think the big issue here is the person in question that he arrested Just got raided and could've been sent up for drug trafficking or have more of there propertys raided cause of the whole establishing a Pattern in arrests with drugs. But since croc didnt do that report or submit evidence but charged him with having drugs it couldn't happen.

[2022-12-08 19:43:53] <%+CrabLordHida> I think civs and Crims get annoyed because cops are the ones who can hand out the punishments, so even if rp punishments people shouldn't be 'rewarded' for the behaviour they punish others for

[2022-12-08 19:45:49] <%xChevinxForever> @xchristax Oliebollen are Dutch pastries similar to doughnuts. These deep-fried treats are typically filled with raisins and dusted with powdered sugar. Some modern variations are served with berry filling, but this is a traditional recipe. Oliebollen are a popular treat on New Year's. Eat them hot if possible!

[2022-12-08 19:46:13] <%buddha_hands> the extremity of what cops do these days (& get away with like its nothing) is one of the many reasons fueling people not wanting to do policework

[2022-12-08 19:46:50] <%+CrabLordHida> the issue is that characters are cops and not people, so if you remove the cop part from them with a suspension or being fired they have no rp in their eyes

[2022-12-08 19:47:42] <+allknowing934> an easy fix to make people more accepting of it would be keeping your pd prio when sent off duty/suspended so people who rely on their cop streams can still have something to do
