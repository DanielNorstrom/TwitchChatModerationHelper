[2022-12-20 23:01:33] <+Zenstudent> they did most of their extra trash here right? first and second bosses they just cleared the mobs u need to play boss correctly?

[2022-12-20 23:02:04] <+SxyOdawg> Just get 100% here is easier and skip 2 last big mobs before last boss tbh
[2022-12-20 23:02:14] <+SxyOdawg> Just go boss and 2 adds seperately and meld them off

[2022-12-20 23:04:14] <Berg1642> @Fragnance if you care so much about loot, why dont you go 7/8?
[2022-12-20 23:04:54] <%+RobcyYy> bcs they need gear to get 7/8
[2022-12-20 23:05:27] <%+Vanishiny> @RobcyYy i think they would have killed it if they have had 1 day on it instead of a couple of hours
