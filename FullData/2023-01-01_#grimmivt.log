[2023-01-01 06:30:22] <KillerQ13> That and lack of vitamin D supplements

[2023-01-01 08:26:35] <!%Prof_PavloVT> World hunger has a very easy solution.  Distribute all the food we throw away or just doesn't get harvested for economic reasons to those who are hungry.  It's an issue of distribution not production.
[2023-01-01 08:26:39] <%lms9000> Grease fire

[2023-01-01 08:26:51] <%RomeoEchoDelta> Yes it can cause clogs
[2023-01-01 08:26:54] <!%Prof_PavloVT> It's fine for your sink as long as it's an oil that is liquid at room temperature.  It's bad for sewer systems.
[2023-01-01 08:27:07] <@%Extrafuzzy> I've had to pay for pipe fixing so they do mess up your pipes
