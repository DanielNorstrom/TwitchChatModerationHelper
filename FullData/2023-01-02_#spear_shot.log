[2023-01-02 19:09:09] <crypticc789> whats best lane for panth
[2023-01-02 19:09:14] <Eperkaine> wasnt he just buffed tho?
[2023-01-02 19:09:15] <%fireball_125> make it scale downwards Clueless
[2023-01-02 19:09:18] <FapPitched> should go from 15 to 30 scale
[2023-01-02 19:09:19] <%Mykol98> nah he aready scales. thats to make him not shit early

[2023-01-02 19:09:28] <z_NSR> his q and something else was buffed
[2023-01-02 19:09:29] <+ShadowOzz_> Sion deserves only the worst
[2023-01-02 19:09:34] <skrriimms> is making his ult more steerable a good idea
[2023-01-02 19:09:42] <%+Koz_n_Effect> I want mythics to be like Jg or support items where you buy a thing that gives mythic passive to all legendary items but you have to earn it. This will increase build diversity
