[2023-01-10 05:16:20] <StrawHatTony> @jenazad what is Yulha used for in Rta now? I see her drafted sometimes, what's the idea behind it.

[2023-01-10 05:16:31] <%darwinjohn016> !yulha
[2023-01-10 05:16:31] <^Nightbot> Yulha is currently popular because 1: She has a 100% provoke on her S1 (krau does not) 2: her S2 lets her full cleanse + gives herself a barrier AND cr push, which essentially guarantees she gets her S3 off at low hp (krau is worthless vs debuffs) 3: her S3 ignores all damage share (including arrowell's escort) + heals her if it kills. She is a solid answer to currently popular units like Lhc, adin, riolet, etc due to how easy it is for her to kill them with her S3

[2023-01-10 09:02:45] <revdanny> Problem with stacking dogs  is that they can level up and go into your party
[2023-01-10 09:03:02] <Ichi___1> i hope sg focus more on QoL
[2023-01-10 09:03:13] <son_of_magnustv> My assumption would be that they want to limit the amount of dogs you can have
[2023-01-10 09:03:24] <%Beanflakes> then again you can have dogs equip stuff to lessen equip inventory space right
[2023-01-10 09:03:24] <hinagikukatsurachan> why dog still exist
[2023-01-10 09:03:26] <%+SAlpda> yes
[2023-01-10 09:03:27] <+d34thscyth34> i mean 5x5* dogs into 1 potion, since potion makes unit 6*
[2023-01-10 09:03:27] <loboto1> pet system is worse lololol

[2023-01-10 09:03:44] <Dundainn> craft 5 dog to one potion
[2023-01-10 09:03:55] <%Hyoukenx> they may as well just remove the dogs then, and make characters reach 6 star with catalyst or something
[2023-01-10 09:04:02] <%barald> ye the gold dogs in bulk is bad
[2023-01-10 09:04:03] <%+SAlpda> the total 3,4, and 5 star characters like approximately 280
[2023-01-10 09:04:06] <%Railgun2K20> why

[2023-01-10 10:20:40] <%ML_Zahhak> re-rolling is about maximizing your start so you can horde all your gems
[2023-01-10 10:20:40] <%ie_g> also this game also features account deletion so yeah re-rolling really is smooth
[2023-01-10 10:20:46] <%ML_Zahhak> its not about getting 1 SSR
