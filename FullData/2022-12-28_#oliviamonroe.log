[2022-12-28 16:38:28] <tietie5> doom 64
[2022-12-28 16:38:29] <leo_coelho> doom 1996
[2022-12-28 16:38:32] <socialistOtter> Chex Quest was genuinely very fun
[2022-12-28 16:38:37] <leo_coelho> doom 2
[2022-12-28 16:38:38] <+Billyblbl> didn't you start one of them already ? might end what you started
[2022-12-28 16:38:46] <Corrupted_Pancake> Doom 69 is a game apparently
[2022-12-28 16:38:47] <%$Puipu> Düm Wan olivia50Cheer
[2022-12-28 16:38:48] <Corrupted_Pancake> I googled it
[2022-12-28 16:38:48] <@%owlishnick> Split screen play all three at once
[2022-12-28 16:38:51] <%beta_weasel> we gotta rip and tear from the beginning, right?
[2022-12-28 16:38:51] <%Temporal_Paradox> might as well start with the first then I suppose
[2022-12-28 16:38:51] <%+TsarBomba9271> NOT MORE REVIEWS
[2022-12-28 16:38:54] <%Sotetsu> You gotta play them in order so you don't miss any plot

[2022-12-28 16:39:00] <@%BlackCharcz> Doom 64 is acutally pretty amazing, but much better when you have some experience with Doom 1 and 2
[2022-12-28 16:39:05] <%rempac15> LUL something you want to tell us Oli?

[2022-12-28 16:40:19] <leo_coelho> a one star review will teach bethesta a lesson
[2022-12-28 16:40:19] <%$SigWtf> Why you do this Todd Howard?!
[2022-12-28 16:40:20] <%Sleeper_can> Morbis left a Doom review.
[2022-12-28 16:40:24] <%$Puipu> that dude is ENDING the entire DOOM franchise with that one star
[2022-12-28 16:40:25] <+SASVULTURE> Im about to head to bed but happy timeone olvia
[2022-12-28 16:40:29] <!%AirahsELL> gonna guess this game requires it.
[2022-12-28 16:40:32] <SystemOfADork> Doom2016, unless you're trying to use a usb mouse&keyboard too, is built to be playable on a controller, unlike it's gramps
[2022-12-28 16:40:35] <%ChibiDeviChaosCH> valid
[2022-12-28 16:40:40] <%berrymike> requiring certain accounts/boot services that will inevitably stop being supported is such bs
[2022-12-28 16:40:40] <%Sotetsu> olivia50Bop Sing in
[2022-12-28 16:40:41] <%Furudehan> I'd rather you try 2016
[2022-12-28 16:40:44] <%rempac15> always online is a bad idea

[2022-12-28 16:40:52] <%+JayBusch> I think they removed the Bethesda account requirement, no?
[2022-12-28 16:40:55] <%beta_weasel> gotta warm up my voics before singing in

[2022-12-28 16:41:11] <%+shibiririreruwa> Playing doom on a console is legit heresy

[2022-12-28 16:41:29] <leo_coelho> I feel 35 of those reviewrs are the same person
[2022-12-28 16:41:29] <!%AirahsELL> you need to be always online to play a single player game. i can think of 37 reasons why this is a bad idea.

[2022-12-28 16:42:23] <%Furudehan> I very mind.
[2022-12-28 16:42:27] <%TalkingObject> I don't mind.
[2022-12-28 16:42:28] <$AFlatCap> I can't believe I come in and Olivia says HELL. Not very wholesome for the Christmas season!!!
[2022-12-28 16:42:29] <tietie5> or you could play doom 1 in doom eternal
[2022-12-28 16:42:30] <%Sotetsu> I prefer m&k
[2022-12-28 16:42:31] <!%AirahsELL> i mean doom 2016 and eternal are not doom games. theyre closer to to quake and unreal.
[2022-12-28 16:42:32] <!%Fuzzgotgames> I dont mind, but I do prefer mouse keyboard
[2022-12-28 16:42:36] <twFROMAN> I have friends that worked on all of the modern Doom releases, so I don't care which one you end up playing haha
[2022-12-28 16:42:36] <$haiddon> I can do it, but mouse and keyboard is better
[2022-12-28 16:42:42] <%+Kaithar> DRM is always hell, but sign in is probably one of the less obnoxious ones... not "find word in manual" or "install this root kit"
[2022-12-28 16:42:44] <@%BlackCharcz> yes, honestly can't do it for FPS, but I don't dunk on it. I know it's just my MASTER RACE upbringing
[2022-12-28 16:42:46] <%+JayBusch> I used to not mind, now I can’t play with controller
[2022-12-28 16:42:46] <%+shibiririreruwa> You'll switch over to the light side eventually
[2022-12-28 16:42:46] <%Meowjln> It's fine depending on how you can customize the controls
[2022-12-28 16:42:47] <%$ArcReaper_21> I prefer mouse and keyboard, but can deal with controller
[2022-12-28 16:42:47] <twFROMAN> I prefer M/KB, but I can use controller without issue
[2022-12-28 16:42:49] <%ChibiDeviChaosCH> depends on the game
[2022-12-28 16:42:51] <%TalkingObject> I like KB+M for aimming, controller for everything else
[2022-12-28 16:42:56] <%Meowjln> Need sub 5% deadzone
[2022-12-28 16:42:56] <%$SigWtf> i need keyboard and mouse

[2022-12-28 16:43:14] <%beta_weasel> it seems the bad reviews aren't really about the game
[2022-12-28 16:43:14] <%RekkyVidya> I've played FPS games on PC for so long that playing them with a controller feels unwieldy as hell

[2022-12-28 16:43:56] <!%AirahsELL> Doom64 is the N64 installment of Doom. a lot of people think its a port but its actually a sequel to Doom 2.

[2022-12-28 17:09:22] <@%BlackCharcz> 32 bits, it was running on 386 afirst
[2022-12-28 17:09:24] <MS06_Borjarnon> Yes, but I never let my mom know my username, TheSilverMedian, so you're just guessing in the dark that I'm your kid as you play WoW.

[2022-12-28 17:09:57] <%Sleeper_can> resolution?
[2022-12-28 17:09:59] <%Furudehan> It's either 16 or 32.
[2022-12-28 17:09:59] <%angeryaboutelves> jk 320x200
[2022-12-28 17:09:59] <abysshunted> actually I take it back, the original game required an Intel 386... so, 32-bit game
[2022-12-28 17:10:02] <%+Kaithar> 386 was 16 bit iirc?
[2022-12-28 17:10:06] <%+JayBusch> This game was 320x200 I think.
[2022-12-28 17:10:14] <%Rolandkrain> People are still making mods for this game to this day.
[2022-12-28 17:10:15] <!%Fuzzgotgames> you want the bitrate

[2022-12-28 17:10:23] <%enixtm> unfortunately you're not free of the number keys in this game, that's where switching the weapons is
[2022-12-28 17:10:24] <!%+jossahmol> 6 pixels LUL
[2022-12-28 17:10:24] <!%AirahsELL> she means the color count.

[2022-12-28 17:10:28] <%+JayBusch> @abysshunted Nah, that’s a 16-bit game. Windows 95.
[2022-12-28 17:10:28] <nerdmeistere> they are zombies

[2022-12-28 17:10:32] <+TheSilverMedian> You’d be amazed at the number of mods this game has. I’ve played quite a few.
[2022-12-28 17:10:35] <%+Rocrhulan> NOBODY GETS ANY PIXELS
[2022-12-28 17:10:35] <%SaintanickClause> Probably 32 bits
[2022-12-28 17:10:37] <MS06_Borjarnon> This was during the VGA era. 256 colors.
[2022-12-28 17:10:38] <%Krallericoner> PC games don't go by bits count. It's a console games thing.
[2022-12-28 17:10:40] <%errno22> The bit depth for graphics?
[2022-12-28 17:10:43] <Lareolan> This game is before the first story was written
[2022-12-28 17:10:48] <%SaintanickClause> I don’t know lol
[2022-12-28 17:10:49] <@%BlackCharcz> based onion though, the soundtrack slaps
[2022-12-28 17:10:49] <ZillaOmega> the people are possessed by demons
[2022-12-28 17:10:52] <%devriestron> anyone know which version of this game she's playing
[2022-12-28 17:10:52] <D3monLuBu> they are not people....they are demons
[2022-12-28 17:10:55] <%TalkingObject> Can you go into options and turn up the gamma a bit?
[2022-12-28 17:10:57] <!%AirahsELL> its a 64 bit unity wrapper, the game was originally 16 bits i think
[2022-12-28 17:11:01] <!%+jossahmol> this game was made before the wheel
[2022-12-28 17:11:09] <%merchantilist> 2-4-8-16-32-64-128. Pixels just kept doubling from 2.
[2022-12-28 17:11:13] <twFROMAN> original doom was 16 or 32 bit, depending on what PC you were playing on haha

[2022-12-28 17:11:28] <%TalkingObject> Gamma or brightness
[2022-12-28 17:11:28] <%StuckBoy> gamma = level brightness

[2022-12-28 17:11:43] <MS06_Borjarnon> Gamma is a type of brightness that's more like contrast than general brightness.
[2022-12-28 17:11:49] <%Carkistador> theres a mod where every sound is the Tim Allen grunt.
[2022-12-28 17:11:52] <%ZataraSWE> one of the last easter eggs was found recently in this game, quite fun how it took people years to find it

[2022-12-28 17:12:31] <%+JayBusch> No autosave
[2022-12-28 17:12:32] <@%BlackCharcz> Tech talk, OG doom was 32 bits, 256 colors, and used special 320x200 resolution, stretched to look like 640x480. Was that enough numbers for you? LUL
[2022-12-28 17:12:35] <%Krallericoner> It auto-saves at the start of every level.
[2022-12-28 17:12:35] <%+penguin_poggers_> @Sotetsu i might use that
[2022-12-28 17:12:39] <%enclave2701> backseat is allowed ?
[2022-12-28 17:12:42] <%devriestron> there should be keys for quick save and quick load, so you can just press a key to save the game instantly

[2022-12-28 17:12:53] <%Furudehan> No saves if you die in the game you die for real.
[2022-12-28 17:12:55] <%Sleeper_can> This game DOES NOT Autosave in levels only at the start of levels. You need to save manually.
[2022-12-28 17:12:57] <twFROMAN> yee, vertical aim is handled automatically
[2022-12-28 17:12:58] <!%+jossahmol> the back seat is super comfy in this stream

[2022-12-28 17:22:37] <%Teknemancer> a lot of video game violence panic was because of this game
[2022-12-28 17:22:39] <MS06_Borjarnon> To be fair, gore is kind of out there and horrific, but oddly we accept it more than lovin' of the more physical kind.
[2022-12-28 17:22:40] <%twFROMAN> yes correct. Pong, (no mario or anything, of course not,) then Doom.
[2022-12-28 17:22:41] <@%BlackCharcz> they almost didn't get away with it, but the bad press they got still helped to sell the game

[2022-12-28 17:23:04] <%Furudehan> Lots of old pc consoles existed before NES.
[2022-12-28 17:23:04] <!%AirahsELL> youre completely forgetting the entire early console generations, the great video game crash of 1983, and the nintendo renaissance. doom came out in 1993.

[2022-12-28 17:40:43] <MS06_Borjarnon> I recommend dropping into the small channel of toxic sludge and running to one of the two ends anyway, because you'll eventually end up getting another weapon and the blue sphere.

[2022-12-28 18:31:59] <$vyran022> These extrovert behaviors sound like something a narrator would mention in a true crime documentary. "She knew the names of all of her neighbors. She waved to everyone she passed by."

[2022-12-28 19:14:58] <MS06_Borjarnon> You always start an episode with the pistol. But guess what? Each level has the weapons and items you need to complete it, so you can start any level with just a pistol and fist.

[2022-12-28 19:21:45] <+Twilight_Gamer9206> Bit of advice: Explore as much as you can. Episode II can be unforgiving for the under-prepared. Especially on Ultra Nightmare difficulty.

[2022-12-28 19:22:47] <%TalkingObject> Do you prefer this or the 2016 one?
[2022-12-28 19:22:50] <CrypticNinja24> that's so funny I'm playing elden ring

[2022-12-28 19:22:51] <MS06_Borjarnon> One of the mashers contains a side room you can sneak into if you are fast enough to get in there without getting squished.
