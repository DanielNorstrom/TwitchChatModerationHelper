[2023-01-08 00:57:09] <KoJack92> argon is easy
[2023-01-08 00:57:14] <KoJack92> well annoying as well
[2023-01-08 00:57:22] <!%micahlee83> argon is the ice sculptor
[2023-01-08 00:57:22] <%whipseclip> you're on Thirian right?
[2023-01-08 00:57:31] <!%micahlee83> it's ez, but it's boring and slow
[2023-01-08 00:57:34] <+Ralir> you need to do the perfect amount of damage
[2023-01-08 00:57:38] <+Ralir> without being able to see hp

[2023-01-08 00:58:23] <!%micahlee83> you have 100% chance of the sculpture being made if you get it's hp to exactly zero
[2023-01-08 00:58:37] <%whipseclip> yeah but he takes the pan and its 100%
[2023-01-08 00:58:39] <!%micahlee83> so you get it low and you slap it with the mokoko skillet until you get it

[2023-01-08 01:06:19] <!%micahlee83> yes
[2023-01-08 01:06:24] <%Failchon> you see the red bar above?
[2023-01-08 01:06:26] <%Kwadrat_> thats the best part u dont
[2023-01-08 01:06:31] <%Failchon> the red part will be gone soon
[2023-01-08 01:06:32] <!%micahlee83> exactly
[2023-01-08 01:06:39] <KoJack92> it needs to dissapear
[2023-01-08 01:06:41] <%whipseclip> no its a lot
[2023-01-08 01:06:45] <%Failchon> yes
[2023-01-08 01:06:46] <!%micahlee83> that's why we use the skillet later do garauntee it
[2023-01-08 01:06:46] <@%^Streamlabs> because it's the best.
[2023-01-08 01:06:53] <!%micahlee83> yes
[2023-01-08 01:06:54] <%Failchon> just be patient
[2023-01-08 01:06:58] <%Failchon> it takes some time
[2023-01-08 01:07:00] <%whipseclip> i did this witha right click macro
[2023-01-08 01:07:01] <KoJack92> no
[2023-01-08 01:07:01] VIEWERS: 578
[2023-01-08 01:07:05] <%whipseclip> took 20 minutes or so
[2023-01-08 01:07:07] <KoJack92> you can still see red
[2023-01-08 01:07:15] <!%micahlee83> took me like 30-45 minutes, but i was super weary
[2023-01-08 01:07:21] <+Xpotion> @Baker I would not risk it tbh just go pan and afk hit away
[2023-01-08 01:07:29] <!%micahlee83> i started using the skillet way too early lol
[2023-01-08 01:07:39] <!%micahlee83> you can't afk @Xpotion
[2023-01-08 01:07:40] <KoJack92> I think DonTheCrown has a good method, hits like 20 times after it's no red bar
[2023-01-08 01:07:43] <%Failchon> i think i was using pan at this point
[2023-01-08 01:07:46] <!%micahlee83> they stop you after a bit
[2023-01-08 01:07:49] <%Failchon> but it will take like 10 min
[2023-01-08 01:07:57] <%whipseclip> best is to have the red bar disappear
[2023-01-08 01:07:59] <%Kwadrat_> if u see any red its way to much for pan

[2023-01-08 18:08:19] <@%+strengthie> People can fuck you in vykas pretty easy though
[2023-01-08 18:08:20] <+Gafiam> it's not hard, it's just that kakul is easier xD
[2023-01-08 18:08:23] <+Gafiam> in my opinion
[2023-01-08 18:09:13] <+Gafiam> when I'm doing with my guild Vykas is safe, but on pubs I've been jailed more in Vykas than Kakul xD

[2023-01-08 18:11:00] <@%+strengthie> it always feels worse getting jailed in older content imo

[2023-01-08 19:14:15] <!%micahlee83> don't you just have to spend money?
[2023-01-08 19:14:25] <%+UnzipsRS> if its your main steam account you probably never run into this issue since you probably buy games all the time but if its a fresh steam account which u havent spent money on before u have to buy something via steam to be trusted
[2023-01-08 19:14:34] <%+UnzipsRS> doesnt have to be a big game can be a $5 one for all the ycase
[2023-01-08 19:14:37] <%+UnzipsRS> they care*

[2023-01-08 19:17:08] <!%micahlee83> is this Lost Ark support? Why is my account banned? I didn't cheat or anything
[2023-01-08 19:17:08] <@%^Streamlabs> because it's the best.
[2023-01-08 19:17:12] <%+UnzipsRS> doesnt require anything else
[2023-01-08 19:17:45] <!%micahlee83> the funny thing is you have to do the 2 factor thing to spend money inside game

[2023-01-08 19:39:16] <+Xpotion> @Sasquoth It's just a game there is no need to feel succesful as long as you enjoy the game, when you don't enjoy it anymore take a break or play something else
[2023-01-08 19:39:20] <+WorthyVI> yeah true actually
[2023-01-08 19:39:39] <%+TrickmasteH> yep

[2023-01-08 19:41:22] <Tamedgod> @WorthyVI it's usually better to just buy the ones u need, only saves about 30-40k gold ea while wrecking your silver
