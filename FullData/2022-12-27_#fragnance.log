[2022-12-27 12:58:53] <+Darkwater_Ebonrose> ya that part would be super foreign to me given that i'm born and raised in wisconsin, usa. we have snow on the ground 5-6 months out of the year often times lol
[2022-12-27 12:59:07] <+supanova84> lol
[2022-12-27 12:59:10] <+Darkwater_Ebonrose> a non-winter christmas would be so weird
[2022-12-27 12:59:46] <%+devilbride> we had snow exactly 1 week before the xmas-days.. and now we have spring or rather autumn weather.. its sunny, cloudy, windy, rainy - in all ways of rotation.. and 10°C +.. crazy weather
[2022-12-27 12:59:54] <+Darkwater_Ebonrose> does australia get much for snow in its winters?
[2022-12-27 13:00:07] <+supanova84> no snow, slapping on the sunscrean, firing up the bbq and playing cricket on the beach is the AUS christmas
[2022-12-27 13:00:10] <+Darkwater_Ebonrose> @devilbride sounds pretty nice not gonna lie

[2022-12-27 13:00:40] <+Darkwater_Ebonrose> @supanova84 interesting lol. makes sense though
[2022-12-27 13:00:41] <+supanova84> @Darkwater_Ebonrose in some parts of Aus yes we get plenty of snow in winter
[2022-12-27 13:00:48] <+Darkwater_Ebonrose> gotcha
[2022-12-27 13:00:50] <%+devilbride> @Darkwater_Ebonrose you cannot imagine how happy I am that there is no snow.. me and my dog hate snow^^
[2022-12-27 13:00:56] <+Darkwater_Ebonrose> i imagine the more southern areas?

[2022-12-27 13:05:05] <%+devilbride> snow is really annoying - especially if you have to walk with dogs and bec of no license^^ its fcking disgusting with all the little stones in the shoes  which you carry all over where you go -.- even for my dog a nightmare :/
[2022-12-27 13:05:26] <+Darkwater_Ebonrose> :(

[2022-12-27 13:07:37] <+Darkwater_Ebonrose> thing is though, snow is fine when it's cleared from traffic areas
[2022-12-27 13:07:49] <+Darkwater_Ebonrose> it's when it keeps coming down and cluttering up the place that it sucks
[2022-12-27 13:08:30] <+Darkwater_Ebonrose> but the cold quiet of the north woods in the middle of winter is pretty serene imo. a bit eerie, but serene

[2022-12-27 13:08:48] <+Darkwater_Ebonrose> pretty calming
[2022-12-27 13:09:19] <+Darkwater_Ebonrose> especially if you get a nice gentle wind on a cold day or night. whispering pines
[2022-12-27 13:09:37] <+Darkwater_Ebonrose> it's a pretty specific gentle howl through the pines
[2022-12-27 13:09:58] <%+devilbride> yea, and if you don´t have to go for a few walks with the dog on this not cleaned ways / streets..  here the neighbours didn´t clean up the ways, so i stood ankle deep in the snow and had to walk this way for 200m.. the other street was cleaned and mountained the snow on the walkers way side -.-  awful

[2022-12-27 13:10:59] <+Darkwater_Ebonrose> they make little dog booties though, for their feet
[2022-12-27 13:11:23] <%+devilbride> if you life in an area where is a beautiful landscape, snow is really beautiful, but not if you´re living in a city / village.. that sucks as hell
[2022-12-27 13:11:38] <+Darkwater_Ebonrose> indeed
[2022-12-27 13:11:40] <%+devilbride> @Darkwater_Ebonrose my dog would never wear shoes^^
[2022-12-27 13:12:22] <+Darkwater_Ebonrose> most dogs wouldn't feel right in them at first for sure, but they might grow to like them when they realize their feet are warmer in the snow lol

[2022-12-27 22:39:37] <!Lazelia> they throw bodies at the boss and at some point the boss dies anyways because the game isn't built in a way everyone needs to be team players
[2022-12-27 22:40:05] <!Lazelia> and dps players abuse that fact (never become better players) by just whoring/padding or w.e so your guild is in shambles all the time

[2022-12-27 22:40:29] <!Lazelia> it is only when you play a tank or a healer in the game to a respectable degree you learn that padding as dps is never the move

[2022-12-27 22:40:43] <flawlesslykun> but i don't even mean raiding as the main issue... it's game design dogshit imho, and it's not just wow like i said
[2022-12-27 22:40:46] <!Lazelia> or if someone puts you in your place for padding i guess

[2022-12-27 22:49:58] <flawlesslykun> @Lazelia last thing on this topic just because i remembered... the best example i use nowadays is cod warzone. You legit cannot find a single mf that plays that game, that lands within 2 km's of your squadmates
[2022-12-27 22:49:58] <%iMarius> No info on Twitter, do we know who frag is doing the MDI with?
