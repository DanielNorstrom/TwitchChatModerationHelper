[2022-12-16 10:39:23] <%fps_wolf22> @Abandoned_Bad_DragonToy don't think clear the mind close your eyes and I usual just listen to asmr and listen to there voice and I fall asleep pretty quick
[2022-12-16 10:39:23] <%Maxximooose> Also 6'0" :D  (on a good day maybe 6'1", my back is really messed up)  No real preference, but I enjoy short friends that I can lift up in huge hugs

[2022-12-16 11:18:26] <%Maxximooose> As a man I always thought that it wasn't good to be called cute, it was like "you're not someone to date, but someone to enjoy being near" but over time I learned it's ok.  Handsome/cute/pretty/manly are perfectly valid.
[2022-12-16 11:18:26] <Brand_New_Sol> male self confidence is directly related to their ability to attract partners (most guys I think), so shy guys don't think they're hot
