[2022-12-29 13:04:21] <@%R2DU> @loboged Heisting is a treasure hunt that happens once in a while. You can take part with other viewers to get a chance to double or lose your Salt Crystals (maximum 10,000 points per heist). To start a heist or enter an existing heist type !heist followed by the number of points you're heisting, e.g. !heist all, !heist 1. Also see !points and !pointshelp AYAYARRR AYAYARRR

[2022-12-29 16:33:06] <HeeJaw> pi's decimals do not show any repetition, and are infinite. So they are random until you've calculated the next/last decimal. And they do not fit anywhere, the information of pi i mean. Not even in the universe. That is why we are living on the last pi's decimals. I believe.

[2022-12-29 16:37:45] <HeeJaw> FUN FACT: An old man is as old as a baby. Why? BECAUSE WE ARE MADE OF ATOMS. And ATOMS are about as old. Over 10 billion years at least. Maybe as old as the universe is.
[2022-12-29 16:37:47] <HerculeanTusk> it is slower than zerus but more powerful so in the end it balances out

[2022-12-29 17:13:12] <%LetsGetBoosted> @FRANzesFRANcisco during WOTLK in 2008-2012 they started doing fucked microtransaction stuff for pets etc, and it just went rampant from there. Like you used to be able to CALL blizzard support if you had an issue. Now customer service doesn't exist
