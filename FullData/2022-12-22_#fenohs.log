[2022-12-22 19:59:20] <babyyshaark_> no matter what you do it was always lethal

[2022-12-22 19:59:46] <secondbonsai> if order was same you'd only hace spawned 2 shooty things so would have bee 1 off
[2022-12-22 19:59:51] <%bogmonster2> @blaze35hs it was a 50/50 lethal
[2022-12-22 20:00:01] <blaze35hs> so id miss
[2022-12-22 20:00:15] <+Moophisto> It was 50/50 you either kill him or he lives
[2022-12-22 20:00:23] <+kwnstantine> nope
[2022-12-22 20:00:23] <%bogmonster2> it was 1 off with 2 stalks
[2022-12-22 20:00:30] <GengarSmiles> if u could summon 3 of the 1-2s u would win
[2022-12-22 20:00:30] <+kwnstantine> you needed 3 stlks

[2022-12-22 20:00:38] <GengarSmiles> 16+2+2+2 was lethal
[2022-12-22 20:00:55] <suji_baby> no because of boardspace - you would have had to play the 16 damage guy first then its 50/50 if giga spawns first or dh thing
[2022-12-22 20:01:01] <GengarSmiles> would probably not get board space for the 1-2s
[2022-12-22 20:01:15] <ath3rishispida> 50/50 really good since its not the all in play

[2022-12-22 20:02:03] <GengarSmiles> he would summon astalor, gigafin is 2 spaces and then the other colossal was 4 spaces which means 6 damage from him no?

[2022-12-22 20:02:15] <GengarSmiles> or did i miss a minion that would be summoned
[2022-12-22 20:02:29] <%bogmonster2> @GengarSmiles astalor, trickster, gigafin is 4 spaces so xhilag+2 stalks
[2022-12-22 20:02:35] <suji_baby> @GengarSmiles he would have had to play the 4 mana guy to get the stash in

[2022-12-22 21:06:54] <!%fribzi> @FenoHS - Real answer. I do enjoy you switching decks the most, but sometimes I miss the "spam Alignment" kinda days. It's nice to see you dedicated to a certain deck sometimes
[2022-12-22 21:06:57] <babyyshaark_> you play one bad deck i think wich is shaman

[2022-12-22 22:25:37] <%+KBB24_Mamba_Forever> This game as forged some of my earliest memories of playing games but does is this still a pretty good game or no because this game is an BANGER. The soundtrack just goes so well with where you are in the game and the controls are so much easier to get the hang from the first game. It feels just so good to roam around in the game spray painting and grinding. If you have some friends who are willing you try out the multiplayer mode my favorite is most likely ball hog.
