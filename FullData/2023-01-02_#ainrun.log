[2023-01-02 09:24:50] <%YourSkillIssue> the portal is on a broken pillar. There is another way to drop there from...Nokstella, not from here
[2023-01-02 09:24:56] <%shklortt> i think you can fall from nokron to dragonkin but not climb up from deep siofra
[2023-01-02 09:25:00] <+DanielMors> other way is dropping down from second moose

[2023-01-02 09:26:17] <%BigPissser> okay so if you ARE gonna allow yourself to fight radahn, you'll be able to get the greatshield soldier ashes, 5 soldiers with greatshields that throw frost pots. obviously, this summon will be very good, since they're tanky as hell, block all the time, and they use frost, yet another percentage based damage

[2023-01-02 12:01:34] <%+Sirpnie> Hey guys, did you know that in terms of male human and female Pokémon breeding, Vaporeon is the most compatible Pokémon for humans? Not only are they in the field egg group, which is mostly comprised of mammals, Vaporeon are an average of 3"03' tall and 63.9 pounds. this means they're large enough to be able to handle human dicks, and with their impressive Base Stats for HP and access to Acid Armor, you can be rough with one.
