[2022-12-09 03:51:58] <%$the_realcryptotech> How I believe taxes should be structured is what I call artificial demand. Meaning addictive products are rated and have a % tax placed depending on how addictive they are. This tax would be applied to both production and purchase by consumers.  Then a small 2% income tax that would lower by 1/8% every year till it‚Äôs nonexistent. No more income tax. When someone reaches retirement they are now exempt from all taxes. If you make 1 million a year then the 2% will continue to apply to you.

[2022-12-09 04:07:40] <%haiddon> best part of the show so far, tbh
[2022-12-09 04:07:48] <@%AJ_Hyper_Bit> you know, I think our taxes are mostly fine, I think the main thing is we need a fraction of what we have going into the military, not in the military KEKW so you know, we get some level of our taxes to do shit for the citizens, not companies. I don't think taxing people more is a good solution at this point, and I don't think taxing people less (unless it is because the military expense basically disappears) is a solution either KEKW

[2022-12-09 05:29:08] <!%willrob87> isn't Microsoft/ Xbox the only one with their own OS (operating systems)
[2022-12-09 05:29:12] <%UnH0lyHal0> ARMORED CORE that is what I'm most hyped for
[2022-12-09 05:29:15] <%captain_supermarket> they were almost like polar opposites in where elden ring didn't give you much hints and GOW wouldn't stop giving you hints

[2022-12-09 05:29:51] <!%DarkRaigeFire> I mean if they're going to stay competitive with Xbox they really really need to drop even their one year wait times, and do something similar to the gamepass
[2022-12-09 05:29:54] <@%chairthrowingtim> Another FromSoftware game!

[2022-12-09 06:22:54] <!%DarkRaigeFire> Aioli, allioli or a√Øoli is a cold sauce consisting of an emulsion of garlic and olive oil; it is found in the cuisines of the northwest Mediterranean, from Andalusia to Calabria. The names mean "garlic and oil" in Catalan and Proven√ßal.
[2022-12-09 06:23:02] <%that_bly> aioli is made from garlic and olive oil
[2022-12-09 06:23:05] <$AbbyssalChimera> aioli is an emulsion like mayo, but with garlic.  saying garlic aioli is redundant
