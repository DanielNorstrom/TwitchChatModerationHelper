[2023-01-08 09:53:54] <@%Uhmge> The year is 2050. Cyleo is the only user left on this ancient internet server called Twitch. He remembers the good old days when thousands of people would cheer at his spamming in Thijs chat. They used to call him silly-oh or something like that. With a tear on his cheek, before stepping on the train home after visiting his grandkids, he posts yet another meaningless cocking in that chat, hoping that someday some lost user will join in and notice him.

[2023-01-08 10:05:34] <@%Uhmge> The year is 2050. Cyleo is the only user left on this ancient internet server called Twitch. He remembers the good old days when thousands of people would cheer at his spamming in Thijs chat. They used to call him silly-oh or something like that. With a tear on his cheek, before stepping on the train home after visiting his grandkids, he posts yet another meaningless cocking in that chat, hoping that someday some lost user will join in and notice him.

He remembers the good old days when thousands of people would cheer at his spamming in Thijs chat. They used to call him silly-oh or something like that. With a tear on his cheek, before stepping on the train home after visiting his grandkids, he posts yet another meaningless cocking in that chat, hoping that someday some lost user will join in and notice him.

[2023-01-08 12:43:10] <@%Uhmge> Leeroy Jenkins created a strategy that revolved around trying to defeat your opponent in one turn without requiring any cards on the board. Fighting for board control and battles between minions make an overall game of Hearthstone more fun and compelling, but taking 20+ damage in one turn is not particularly fun or interactive.

[2023-01-08 14:39:25] <@%Uhmge> The year is 2050. Cyleo is the only user left on this ancient internet server called Twitch. He remembers the good old days when thousands of people would cheer at his spamming in Thijs chat. They used to call him silly-oh or something like that. With a tear on his cheek, before stepping on the train home after visiting his grandkids, he posts yet another meaningless cocking in that chat, hoping that someday some lost user will join in and notice him.
