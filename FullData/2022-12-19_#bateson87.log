[2022-12-19 17:24:07] <baileyh_06> it was a great game
[2022-12-19 17:24:12] <+xbox_anon08> No question Argentina would win pens be Martinez is a savage
[2022-12-19 17:24:15] <baileyh_06> best of the tournament

[2022-12-19 17:24:24] <+fedora_the_explorer_69> Is prime gaming pack out yet?
[2022-12-19 17:24:27] <Op7iMiZeD> 5 very questionable penalties in 7 games for Argentina, I dont like to think theres such thing as a bought wc, but.....
[2022-12-19 17:24:36] <NBF_82> I didn’t think France’s second penalty was a penalty personally, probably the only thing the ref got wrong
[2022-12-19 17:24:45] <$stuartjamess88> They got lucky in previous rounds with some decisions tbh but they won the final fair and square, just don’t like how unsportsmanlike they are tbh especially the keeper. Bordering on disrespectful
