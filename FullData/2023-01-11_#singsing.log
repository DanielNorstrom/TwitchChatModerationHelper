[2023-01-11 07:41:14] <!%LinLin_nn> What kinda leaves they having
[2023-01-11 07:41:22] <@%julliant> The female VIPS then used her body to get more leaves from other VIPS
[2023-01-11 07:41:22] <%Nutzzz96> @LinLin_nn, I think it was leaves distributed as currencies
[2023-01-11 07:41:23] <%trolsopol> @Ji04 female monkeys would learn more leaves is better and would start givingthe puttang to other monkeys for extra leaves
[2023-01-11 07:41:35] <%Nutzzz96> so the MONKE could trade leaves for some random food

[2023-01-11 07:43:11] <%Nutzzz96> thats the part thats illegal in my country I think
[2023-01-11 07:43:13] <%trolsopol> prostitution is not bad itself because prostitutes decide who to fuck and not
[2023-01-11 07:43:18] <%trolsopol> pimps are bad
[2023-01-11 07:43:23] <%trolsopol> cause they abuse all the time
[2023-01-11 07:43:24] <%Nutzzz96> ye
[2023-01-11 07:43:35] <%trolsopol> for age, steal the money of the women etc..
[2023-01-11 07:43:42] <%trolsopol> and human trafficking

[2023-01-11 07:43:57] <%Nutzzz96> mulitude of crimes
[2023-01-11 07:44:03] <!%LinLin_nn> Basically taking advantage of
[2023-01-11 07:44:10] <%trolsopol> the "madamme" in movies is the pimp effectively
[2023-01-11 07:44:25] <%Nutzzz96> I mean if tomorrow you decide to sell ASS I wont stop you cause thats what you want to do Okgayge
[2023-01-11 07:44:27] <%Ji04> fuck movies skewed my vies so hard then
[2023-01-11 07:44:32] <%Ji04> views*
[2023-01-11 07:44:45] <%Nutzzz96> but if I decide to sell your ASS for 5$ that doesnt sound fair doesnt it?
[2023-01-11 07:44:57] <%Ji04> so prostitutes are always solo,unless threesome etc
[2023-01-11 07:45:03] <!%LinLin_nn> So if they willing to sell and not being abuse etc = prostitution?
[2023-01-11 07:45:06] <!%LinLin_nn> Hmm
[2023-01-11 07:45:20] <%Nutzzz96> it comes with more rules I think
[2023-01-11 07:45:26] <%Nutzzz96> like it shouldnt be an establishment
[2023-01-11 07:45:34] <%Nutzzz96> or a certain building etc

[2023-01-11 07:56:48] <%Ji04> the worse one gotta be hygiene right? you can eat shit and sleep 23 hours a day but if you have bad hygiene its gg
[2023-01-11 07:56:59] <%Nutzzz96> not sure
[2023-01-11 07:56:59] <%suxexile> aka WeLost
[2023-01-11 07:57:05] <%Nutzzz96> bad hygiene is up there
[2023-01-11 07:57:25] <%Nutzzz96> but I think not eating shit like iron/zinc would kill you
[2023-01-11 07:58:02] <%trolsopol> There are people who live in terrible hygine conditions and stull live till 50-60
[2023-01-11 07:58:07] <%Nutzzz96> yea

[2023-01-11 07:58:37] <%Nutzzz96> you wont hear about the guy dying at 30 due to poor hygiene but you'd hear about the guy living upto 60 and never taking a bath
[2023-01-11 07:58:37] <%Ji04> survivor bias?

[2023-01-11 07:59:11] <%Nutzzz96> thus our great grandparents used to have 6-8 kids

[2023-01-11 08:25:43] <%trolsopol> wTone_ cause its in my contract 10% extra hours monthly is expected, they never use ot until they do
[2023-01-11 08:25:47] <%trolsopol> :(
[2023-01-11 08:26:16] <%Ji04> WTFF scummy as shit
[2023-01-11 08:26:18] <%darkbiacksnow> Despairge
[2023-01-11 08:26:19] <@%$wTone_> 10% extra hours monthly is expected based on contracts but you arent getting paid for it ?
[2023-01-11 08:26:25] <%trolsopol> And today and tomorrow we have special project that is time sensitive
[2023-01-11 08:26:38] <%trolsopol> Its considered in my salary
[2023-01-11 08:26:39] <!%Yolovsky> SCAMMED
[2023-01-11 08:26:45] <%trolsopol> I am not hourly worker
[2023-01-11 08:26:45] <%darkbiacksnow> Hmm
[2023-01-11 08:26:47] <@%$wTone_> so... it is not overtime then
[2023-01-11 08:26:52] <%trolsopol> It is
[2023-01-11 08:26:52] <%darkbiacksnow> True
[2023-01-11 08:26:53] <@%$wTone_> is actual work hours
[2023-01-11 08:27:05] <@%$wTone_> but you are getting paid for it
[2023-01-11 08:27:08] <%trolsopol> I have to stay after standard work hours
[2023-01-11 08:27:28] <@%$wTone_> thing is you are getting paid for it if it is in your salary
[2023-01-11 08:27:41] <@%$wTone_> is just that you are staying after standard work hours
[2023-01-11 08:28:02] <%trolsopol> Well yes and no. I always get same salary, but have to work more this week
[2023-01-11 08:28:31] <%darkbiacksnow> sounds like SCAMMED to not compensate for overtimes
[2023-01-11 08:28:36] <%trolsopol> So either i am getting payed more for other weeks that i dont do extra time
[2023-01-11 08:28:40] <%darkbiacksnow> but if it pays well then WCYD
[2023-01-11 08:28:50] <@%$wTone_> is not that you are working more this week, you are getting paid more every other week
[2023-01-11 08:28:51] <%trolsopol> Or am not being paind extra for this week
[2023-01-11 08:29:00] <@%$wTone_> because the 10% extra is already part of your salary
[2023-01-11 08:29:12] <%Nutzzz96> Thinkge
[2023-01-11 08:29:14] <@%$wTone_> if they dont use that 10% extra time, or w/e is really their problem
[2023-01-11 08:29:14] <%darkbiacksnow> I have the same clause in my contract actually
[2023-01-11 08:29:16] <%trolsopol> Shrugeg idk it just feels bad
[2023-01-11 08:29:23] <%darkbiacksnow> it says up to 48 hours
[2023-01-11 08:29:33] <%Nutzzz96> depends upon what he should be paid and what he's getting paid Thinkge
[2023-01-11 08:29:38] <%darkbiacksnow> but we are still compensated for it as overtime
[2023-01-11 08:29:52] <%Nutzzz96> same
[2023-01-11 08:29:53] <%Ji04> SCAMMED
[2023-01-11 08:29:55] <@%$wTone_> is like usually people work 40 hours a week, but you signed a contract to work for 44 hours a week
[2023-01-11 08:29:59] <%trolsopol> 11hour days Despair
[2023-01-11 08:30:01] <%Nutzzz96> if I have to stay back = extra pay
[2023-01-11 08:30:09] <@%$wTone_> you are getting paid for 44 hours a week regardless of whether you work 40 hours or 44 hours
[2023-01-11 08:30:21] <%trolsopol> Contract says 35 +10% if needed
[2023-01-11 08:30:25] <@%$wTone_> since you mentioned it is part of your salary
[2023-01-11 08:30:28] <!%Yolovsky> mine was specifically written 9 hours a day (8 hours Workge + 1 hour break) okey
[2023-01-11 08:30:39] <%Nutzzz96> same
[2023-01-11 08:30:46] <@%$wTone_> so either 35 hours a week or 38.5 hours a week work
[2023-01-11 08:30:46] <%Nutzzz96> but overtimes do come once in a while
[2023-01-11 08:30:58] <@%$wTone_> but you are getting paid for 38.5 hours a week
[2023-01-11 08:31:00] <%darkbiacksnow> I hate that 1 hour break is not included in pay here FeelsBadMan
[2023-01-11 08:31:06] <@%$wTone_> every other week you are just working less XD
[2023-01-11 08:31:15] <%darkbiacksnow> my UK coworkers have 8hr work only including break
[2023-01-11 08:31:18] <%darkbiacksnow> MADGEY
[2023-01-11 08:31:25] <@%$wTone_> this week you are fulfilling your contracted hours for your pay
[2023-01-11 08:31:41] <%trolsopol> NOTED wTone_ is in hr
[2023-01-11 08:32:08] <@%$wTone_> i mean everything is in calculated in dollars/hrs
[2023-01-11 08:32:15] <!%Yolovsky> my previous company didn't pay for overtime at all xdd
[2023-01-11 08:32:35] <%darkbiacksnow> isn't that monkaTOS
[2023-01-11 08:32:36] <!%Yolovsky> a server is broken and need fixing? Better fix that ASAP without additional compensation xdd
[2023-01-11 08:32:46] <@%$wTone_> @Yolovsky depending on your country and contract , you may be able to sue them
[2023-01-11 08:32:49] <%trolsopol> The idea is that i can stay later than usual every day if something happens, not to call us for extra hours of standard work imo but i guess its different understanding
[2023-01-11 08:33:05] <%darkbiacksnow> we have government law to protect us from that at least
[2023-01-11 08:33:52] <%Nutzzz96> @Yolovsky, SCAMMED
[2023-01-11 08:33:59] <%darkbiacksnow> but I stopped doing overtime xdd
[2023-01-11 08:34:07] <%darkbiacksnow> I say NOMEGALUL always
[2023-01-11 08:34:11] <%Nutzzz96> same
[2023-01-11 08:34:12] <@%$wTone_> @trolsopol i mean if i am being fair to your employer, i have contracted you for 38.5 hours a week and paying you for 38.5 hours a week, i should be able to use you for that 38.5 hours a week regardless of the case as long as it is work related

[2023-01-11 08:35:03] <%Ji04> Classic legality
[2023-01-11 08:35:23] <%trolsopol> Well the contract doesnt say 38.5 it says 35 +10% extra time if required but this week i'll do 42
[2023-01-11 08:35:41] <%darkbiacksnow> thats 20% Despairge
[2023-01-11 08:35:41] <@%Skwishi> Nukes are armed and ready for chat to use
[2023-01-11 08:35:45] <%Ji04> thats 5 hours over no?
[2023-01-11 08:36:16] <%trolsopol> Yes but they say emergency project smhmyhead and since im senior i'm expected to be there
[2023-01-11 08:36:17] <%Ji04> so they should compensate for that
[2023-01-11 08:36:43] <%trolsopol> They wont and i know it
[2023-01-11 08:36:49] <@%$wTone_> @trolsopol yeah thats 20%
[2023-01-11 08:37:13] <%trolsopol> They will say well last week we didn't call you in so it works out just fine okey
[2023-01-11 08:37:21] <%trolsopol> But imo its nokey
[2023-01-11 08:37:29] <@%$wTone_> TECHNICALLY that is not true
[2023-01-11 08:37:41] <%Ji04> but the 10% is monthly you said?
[2023-01-11 08:37:42] <@%$wTone_> are you paid weekly or monthly ?
[2023-01-11 08:37:56] <@%$wTone_> 10% weekly
[2023-01-11 08:38:00] <%trolsopol> 10% weekly according to contract
[2023-01-11 08:38:15] <%trolsopol> I am paid monthly but hours are calculated weekly
[2023-01-11 08:38:24] <@%$wTone_> if you are paid weekly. they cant make you work 42 hours this week without overtime
[2023-01-11 08:38:30] <%trolsopol> Its weirs but WCYD golden cage
[2023-01-11 08:38:41] <@%$wTone_> if you are paid monthly they can wiggle their way to make you work 42 hours this week
[2023-01-11 08:38:51] <%trolsopol> The pay is still better than competition
[2023-01-11 08:38:54] <@%$wTone_> it all depends on how they play with hthe time
[2023-01-11 08:39:00] <%darkbiacksnow> if pay is good WCYD
[2023-01-11 08:39:11] <@%$wTone_> @trolsopol that is why i didn say dumb shit like "YOU SHOULD QUIT YOUR JOB HUEHUEHUEHUEHUHEUHEUHUE"
[2023-01-11 08:39:34] <%darkbiacksnow> they should at least make
[2023-01-11 08:39:40] <%darkbiacksnow> the overtime hours be wfh instead
[2023-01-11 08:39:42] <%darkbiacksnow> okey
[2023-01-11 08:39:47] <@%$wTone_> also job market is not very good, unless you have specific skills
[2023-01-11 08:39:55] <%trolsopol> Yeah i know just annoyed sajj i can quit any time but others will probably do same shit and pay me less
[2023-01-11 08:40:30] <%trolsopol> Nop mandatory in the office for this project cause its secret and they want to make sure no info leaks
[2023-01-11 08:40:38] <!%Yolovsky> the market is weird, there are a lot of layoffs but I still get a lot of message from recruiters
[2023-01-11 08:40:47] <%darkbiacksnow> yeah
[2023-01-11 08:41:11] <%Ji04> they want more workers,but pay even less Despairge
[2023-01-11 08:41:18] <%darkbiacksnow> dev have this weird idea
[2023-01-11 08:41:21] <%trolsopol> I am infosec so i have specific skills but others just pay less IIWII
[2023-01-11 08:41:22] <%darkbiacksnow> where its better to hire a new one
[2023-01-11 08:41:29] <%darkbiacksnow> than retain and experienced guy and pay that guy well
[2023-01-11 08:41:33] <%darkbiacksnow> WCYD
[2023-01-11 08:42:00] <@%$wTone_> @Yolovsky is because they probably want to replace people who cost too much and arent generating much
[2023-01-11 08:42:39] <@%$wTone_> @trolsopol well , for now i would say just do the 42 hours , treat it as you are giving back for the weeks of 3.5 hours you are ripping off froim them KEK
[2023-01-11 08:42:44] <@%$wTone_> grind hard salaryman
[2023-01-11 08:42:52] <!%Yolovsky> my salary in my previous position was 50% higher than the new hires
[2023-01-11 08:42:58] <!%Yolovsky> same level
[2023-01-11 08:43:11] <@%$wTone_> then why dont you quit
[2023-01-11 08:43:11] <%trolsopol> Yeah WCYD just obey the boss
[2023-01-11 08:43:17] <@%$wTone_> and re apply for the job ?
[2023-01-11 08:43:31] <%darkbiacksnow> you can't re-apply here for at least 6 months
[2023-01-11 08:43:34] <%darkbiacksnow> some actually do that KEK
[2023-01-11 08:43:48] <%darkbiacksnow> guy left 1 year, returned got 3x his salary
[2023-01-11 08:43:48] <@%$wTone_> or look for your HR/boss for a contract review
[2023-01-11 08:44:01] <@%$wTone_> i mean if they are paying new hires for more
[2023-01-11 08:44:15] <!%Yolovsky> I meant, they pay new hires less
[2023-01-11 08:44:23] <@%$wTone_> means you are getting paid less even with more experience
[2023-01-11 08:44:33] <@%$wTone_> means you are probably quite valuable
[2023-01-11 08:45:19] <@%$wTone_> business standpoint, if they are willing to fork out more money for new hires , means they can afford to pay their current more experienced workers more
[2023-01-11 08:45:26] <@%$wTone_> just that they dont tell u about it until u ask
[2023-01-11 08:45:36] <%Ji04> HmmNOTED
[2023-01-11 08:45:37] <%darkbiacksnow> thats what you think but some HR are NOMEGALUL
[2023-01-11 08:45:51] <%darkbiacksnow> until you actually leave for a better offer
[2023-01-11 08:45:54] <@%$wTone_> they wont even offer it to you as that means they have to pay you more
[2023-01-11 08:46:06] <@%$wTone_> @darkbiacksnow then leave
[2023-01-11 08:46:08] <%darkbiacksnow> but at that point its better to just PeepoPeaceOut
[2023-01-11 08:46:13] <%darkbiacksnow> yeah thats what I did in my old work
[2023-01-11 08:46:47] <@%$wTone_> think about it, i am paying new hires with less experience more salary
[2023-01-11 08:46:55] <@%$wTone_> means i probably need someone to train them
[2023-01-11 08:47:01] <@%$wTone_> or break them in
[2023-01-11 08:47:02] <!%LinLin_nn> Is it time to jump company
[2023-01-11 08:47:06] <%darkbiacksnow> ask for more pay, showed evidence, got said NOMEGALUL
[2023-01-11 08:47:16] <@%$wTone_> then it is time to leave
[2023-01-11 08:47:18] <%Ji04> fuck em
[2023-01-11 08:47:23] <%darkbiacksnow> I then submitted my notice then they suddenly
[2023-01-11 08:47:26] <%YeeeeHeeeeCeeee> Time to leave? Shrugeg
[2023-01-11 08:47:26] <%darkbiacksnow> they suddenly have money to pay me
[2023-01-11 08:47:30] <@%$wTone_> ^
[2023-01-11 08:47:30] <%darkbiacksnow> :O
[2023-01-11 08:47:33] <@%$wTone_> that is what i mean
[2023-01-11 08:47:37] <!%Yolovsky> sounds like a normal HR behaviour xpp
[2023-01-11 08:47:41] <@%$wTone_> by they cant afford to lose you
[2023-01-11 08:47:52] <!%LinLin_nn> Idk how to approach the subject of increment PepeLaf
[2023-01-11 08:47:56] <!%LinLin_nn> Too introverted
[2023-01-11 08:47:57] <!%Yolovsky> anyway that was a red flag already
[2023-01-11 08:47:58] <!%LinLin_nn> KEK
[2023-01-11 08:48:11] <%+hongyi90> this corporate way has been like this for years now
[2023-01-11 08:48:13] <!%LinLin_nn> Or even how to leave the company
[2023-01-11 08:48:22] <%darkbiacksnow> in that work, I was the only guy that knew a subset of their tech
[2023-01-11 08:48:27] <%darkbiacksnow> or the only one left
[2023-01-11 08:48:28] <%YeeeeHeeeeCeeee> Just speak up in a normal tone
[2023-01-11 08:48:32] <%darkbiacksnow> so idk what happened to them after xdd
[2023-01-11 08:48:43] <@%$wTone_> if you have 10 experienced guy paid 2500, 20 new hires paid 3000, something obviously isnt right
[2023-01-11 08:48:51] <%YeeeeHeeeeCeeee> Stare into their eye when talking to them to let them know you're serious
[2023-01-11 08:48:54] <%Ji04> WCYD they dont want to retain you
[2023-01-11 08:49:06] <@%$wTone_> if 1 of the experienced guy decides to just peace out,
[2023-01-11 08:49:11] <@%$wTone_> the other 9 will likely follow
[2023-01-11 08:49:16] <!mirakuru797> all these experince HmmNOTED
[2023-01-11 08:49:26] <%darkbiacksnow> yeah thats why they have these bullshit
[2023-01-11 08:49:29] <%darkbiacksnow> clauses in the contract

[2023-01-11 09:13:00] <%Ji04> i dont think soft is the right word,its more desensitized to bad environments
[2023-01-11 09:13:00] <@%$wTone_> remember when you parents would slap you across the face and factory reset you as a result ?

[2023-01-11 09:13:33] <%+hongyi90> its always the parent's responsibility for their child's conduct and actions in public

[2023-01-11 09:14:25] <%+hongyi90> parents whom shirk that responsibility to educate their child on public conduct have no one to blame if their child gets into mishap or accidents

[2023-01-11 09:57:12] <!%mirakuru797> solo leveling is good at art but story is pepeW
[2023-01-11 09:57:24] <!%mirakuru797> too bad i dropped it

[2023-01-11 09:58:45] <%Lei069_> korean manga
[2023-01-11 09:58:59] <Kikuhiko_> yeah its manhwa  Personally I liked how korean manhwa reads from top to bottom
[2023-01-11 09:59:26] <Kikuhiko_> it felt like watching anime since you can't accidentally glance the other panels and authors can really use this kinda panel really creatively sometimes
[2023-01-11 09:59:35] <%YeeeeHeeeeCeeee> Asura the venom dragon is a good read too
[2023-01-11 09:59:37] <!%mirakuru797> https://youtu.be/3ss8A5aaWQ8 Despairge
[2023-01-11 09:59:39] <%+2bitplaya> I dunno where the trend for the protagonist to be a greedy and selfish asshole started but i like it
[2023-01-11 09:59:50] <%YeeeeHeeeeCeeee> There are some whinners complaining the protag is greed
[2023-01-11 10:00:02] <%darkbiacksnow> its because some are bored of the
[2023-01-11 10:00:04] <%YeeeeHeeeeCeeee> There are some whinners complaining the protag is weak
[2023-01-11 10:00:06] <%darkbiacksnow> nice protag trope
[2023-01-11 10:00:13] <%YeeeeHeeeeCeeee> Not greed
[2023-01-11 10:00:14] <!%mirakuru797> just a trend
[2023-01-11 10:00:19] <%Lei069_> need some spice
[2023-01-11 10:00:37] <%+2bitplaya> It's a good change from the usual protagonist tropes
[2023-01-11 10:00:42] <!%mirakuru797> gonna go away after sometime
[2023-01-11 10:00:48] <%darkbiacksnow> usual protag

[2023-01-11 10:04:47] <%darkbiacksnow> is so she can weaken the bullshit villain
[2023-01-11 10:04:55] <%darkbiacksnow> because they made the villain too OP
[2023-01-11 10:05:07] <%darkbiacksnow> and can't actually defeat him without making bullshit

[2023-01-11 11:00:40] <@%julliant> How is it passive

[2023-01-11 11:01:59] <@%julliant> Well passive income usually means very low effort/input
[2023-01-11 11:02:18] <@%julliant> But 3d animation especially for patreon subs would expect X output per month
[2023-01-11 11:02:21] <!%keru_woah> hmm I see, maybe wrong choice of word

[2023-01-11 11:25:44] <@%$Durminon> GDQ got so bad. It isn't that funny geek fest anymore. You are only allowed if you have the save views as the organizers. A few people got banned for just not wanting to display pride stuff while they never said anything against it.

[2023-01-11 11:26:46] <%majemboy> the cause could be better too tho
[2023-01-11 11:26:58] <%majemboy> like, donate to an international fund instead of a USA based one

[2023-01-11 11:27:10] <%majemboy> since you have an international fanbase

[2023-01-11 11:27:35] <%majemboy> Shrugeg
[2023-01-11 11:28:00] <%$satoamina> i think few years back they donated to doctors without borders?
[2023-01-11 11:28:04] <%$satoamina> or did i remember wrongly
[2023-01-11 11:28:10] <!Kyyuna> they still do no?
[2023-01-11 11:28:25] <!Kyyuna> or cancer research
[2023-01-11 11:28:26] <%$satoamina> the current 1 is for prevent cancer foundation
[2023-01-11 11:28:43] <!Kyyuna> but iirc cancer has always been their thing
[2023-01-11 11:29:00] <@%$Durminon> the "best" thing is: the prevent cancer foundation is doing something regular health care is doing in other parts of the world.
[2023-01-11 11:29:03] <%darkbiacksnow> i'd like to see an FF9 speedrun
[2023-01-11 11:29:05] <!Kyyuna> since I always remember the stream of sad cancer dono messages every second that donate for the lowest amount possible
