Now I have a question, when I take some ibuprofen or any other stimulant the video looks more "sharp" is there any setting I can touch so that I can always see it that way?

[2023-01-10 15:54:52] <%+muddycan> @damooseninja so what‚Äôs the grenadier task like for now?üòÇ
[2023-01-10 15:55:01] <Wishs_> I don't feel like the ammo change makes that much of a difference,  as a casual running into sweatlords is still gonna be the same as I usually die to them anyway, running into other casuals is just going to be a longer fight most likely

[2023-01-10 15:56:20] <+Boz____> I feel like these changes will just remove weapon variety because now there‚Äôs hardly anything viable that pens class 4 at lvl 3 traders just bt, and 7.62x54 ps

[2023-01-10 15:57:42] <%+muddycan> Honestly not the worse change for bp considering that‚Äôs all anyone ran but if they took others out what will we doüòÇ
[2023-01-10 15:58:07] <+Boz____> I don‚Äôt really care about bp and m61 cos I mainly crafted bp and just used m62 which I can still do what pisses me off is m80 and ps12b. Ash 12 was my favourite gun and now it takes 30 hours to craft enough ammo for one raid‚Ä¶

[2023-01-10 16:22:24] <@%727life> @ImSoBurr_ bingo! Theres nothing to grind for now and with ahlf the shit removed from flea it just doesn't make sense. So many will still be using paca and shit ammo at the end of wipe because they can't progress/ survive a raid where they actually found some ammo in riad KEKW
[2023-01-10 16:22:24] <%18Cass> at least to me, i'm a casual player it going to take me forever
[2023-01-10 16:22:28] <T0ZKA> @T0ZKA no but maybe when the cassuals become higher level so that the streamers and people who play this game all day wont just kill everyone
[2023-01-10 16:22:29] <Envok33d> @axel_tv do you reset after every streets run?
[2023-01-10 16:22:31] <+Shokwave2k> @ImSoBurr_ same in the beginning for me, i also always died on streets, i hate looting bags and loot and scoot is the way, if you have a good route, you can make 700k each 15 min raid

[2023-01-10 16:23:35] <T0ZKA> @DapperDabber at least they have a chance and dont just get rolled by people in slicks and altyns with BP
[2023-01-10 16:23:39] <@%727life> and yeah I agree @Axel_tv feels like they just dropped off the change without a slow trickle to these type of changes. Just doesn't seem fitting for the current state of the game/ wipes/
[2023-01-10 16:23:58] <%+Airride101> Then what did you have in your rig ?
[2023-01-10 16:23:59] <@%ImSoBurr_> @727life Yeah KEKW some guy yesterday (after I killed his friends) was like "bro you are just wasting money on me, I have nothing", I was like I do not care and proceeded to GL him. He added me and was all mad that I killed him when all he had was a vepr. These new players don't realize with the ammo changes they have literally 0 chance now
[2023-01-10 16:24:04] <@%727life> @T0ZKA they will still get rolled because that other players spends more tiem playing and crafting ammo/ finding it in raid....
[2023-01-10 16:24:12] <+DapperDabber> @t0zka I promise you, Axel will dust your average player with shit gear even if that player has the gear you mention

If they accept, both participants say !roll to roll a number. The higher roll wins, and the lower roll gets a time out. Ties are a reroll.

[2023-01-10 19:05:52] <%+lyrickz> Streets of Tarkov is a main reason a lot of them decided to play this wipe, and to a degree its unplayable without a super computer lol
[2023-01-10 19:06:01] <@%727life> I'm just so over the same shit wipe after wipe after wipe. Hopefully arena will be nice to come back for

[2023-01-10 19:06:23] <%masonvalo> @727life agree, i wanna play that shit on high lvl, comp :D
[2023-01-10 19:06:35] <@%727life> And then (not holding me breath) hopefully we acn see some better changes/ future updates soonTM

[2023-01-10 19:08:05] <@%727life> @lyrickz People like axel, myself and others who had the time to play a lot have ALWAYS said changes like the ones being made now are not good for the game. This type of stuff kills it for casuals (not all but I'd say a major majority).
[2023-01-10 19:08:10] <+OutJoshed> I have got most of my flash drives from cabinets
[2023-01-10 19:08:27] <BorpaScoots> whats with this new factory spawn in the tiny hallway in the corner where a guy spawns outside the hallway? not glass , the opposite corner. any tips
[2023-01-10 19:08:35] <%masonvalo> im thinking about wating till next wipe also, and its only my 2nd wipe overall, its just not it tbh
[2023-01-10 19:08:40] <%+brinnhild> hey hows it going man
[2023-01-10 19:08:41] <%+lyrickz> I honestly think my biggest problem with the changes is that they waited until week 2 of the wipe. Just pull the plug at wipe start and people wouldn't be as angry
[2023-01-10 19:08:48] <%+Flxxxw> Are you gonna go for kappa

[2023-01-10 19:11:13] <+OutJoshed> I like that they want to make gunfights last longer but I get shot in the head so much I don‚Äôt think it will matter with ammo nerfs

[2023-01-10 19:14:47] <%masonvalo> it feeks like i started playing tarkov waaaaaaay to late, started last year, should have started in 2019 ngl ( the good old days)
[2023-01-10 19:14:49] <@%727life> @lyrickz Tbh if a AAA company wanted to they 1000% could replicaet tarkov lol
[2023-01-10 19:15:03] <%Dstruktr> @lyrickz Ohh ok, yea I can agree
[2023-01-10 19:15:08] <%+lyrickz> Let tarkov stay tarkov, but have competition so they can't be complacent
[2023-01-10 19:15:09] <@%727life> but also would ruin the game even faster than BSG LUL

[2023-01-10 19:17:09] <@%727life> @lyrickz yeah I meant more so if like stealing game ideas/ design wasn't a big no no that a AAA company could make tarkov and be better about it due to more funding, resources and ability to have more peopel working on it for faster patches of content/ fixes.

[2023-01-10 19:17:58] <%+lyrickz> @727life Yea that I agree with. I had hopes DMZ on Cod would have had more effort put into it. I don't love COD , but atleast it could have threatened them
[2023-01-10 19:18:06] <+OutJoshed> Literally for me just stop making tarkov sales and I would enjoy this game in almost any state ammo nerfs, gun ect..
[2023-01-10 19:18:20] <%$HazardwasteQc> Is it just me getting better at noticing them or are there more cheaters this wipe? at least 4 blatant cheaters killed me yesterday
[2023-01-10 19:18:30] <Crujien> @727life I'm still sad that both BF with HazardZone and CoD with DMZ completely failed to understand what people like about extraction based games like Tarkov

[2023-01-10 19:19:00] <%+lyrickz> They need to do the sales, after like 2-3 wipes most people don't want to do play anymore. If they don't try to bring in new players the game will die for sure

[2023-01-10 19:21:59] <@%727life> @lyrickz I think it's a bit of both, more people are coming to see what hackers are looking like when not rage hacking and then being more annoyed with the amount they are running into.

[2023-01-10 20:57:28] <Lion_Jonson> ttk will not higher cuz i have 3k stock of 762 bp Kappa

[2023-01-10 20:58:24] <jabba22r_ttv> I think they should also address recoil for guns like the m4/hk
[2023-01-10 20:58:24] <Zakexx> yo, hey, is there any fix how to not be rubberbanding 100% time one streets?

[2023-01-10 20:58:57] <kotelonorsu> Is money making a lot harder now?
[2023-01-10 20:58:59] <%+SteelRhythm> Don't play streets until they fix it.
[2023-01-10 20:59:00] <@%$GigsTM> Streets always has lag until some of the PMC's die.
[2023-01-10 20:59:00] <%Dstruktr> Foolproof
[2023-01-10 20:59:02] <%Yuki_Duki> @Zakexx and turn off binaural
[2023-01-10 20:59:02] <%Thrillpickle> The pull out method KEKW
[2023-01-10 20:59:07] <Zakexx> KEKW nice
[2023-01-10 20:59:11] <jabba22r_ttv> 5.45 and 5.56 need buffs
[2023-01-10 20:59:12] <Arukora> That sounds amazing, very good method KEKW

[2023-01-10 20:59:18] <@%$GigsTM> If you spawn into streets and never have lag issues, it's likely dead or has a low number of PMC's.
[2023-01-10 20:59:36] <@%$GigsTM> Frames/server issues are noticeable with more people.
[2023-01-10 20:59:38] <%$Xv_Ruckus_vX> Once the server settles down though streets is amazing
[2023-01-10 21:00:09] <@%$GigsTM> Bsg should reduce the number of players to a stable count. At least until they get the rubberbanding sorted.
[2023-01-10 21:00:12] <jabba22r_ttv> I think this change shoukd have been at the start of wipe however @Axel_tv
[2023-01-10 21:00:26] <jabba22r_ttv> makes no sense 3 weeks in
