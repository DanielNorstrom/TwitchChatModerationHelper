[2023-01-06 15:54:24] <BranannerBread> TTK on new MW2 is faster. Not sure about WZ1 though.

[2023-01-06 15:54:27] <@%ThatOneCel> Yep that it
[2023-01-06 15:54:27] <%tickclaps> no faster TTk than a Kar98 to the face

[2023-01-06 15:57:08] <%JC_Flow_> I loved the pace of Rebirth
[2023-01-06 15:57:08] <+xRelish> Of course everyone loved Verdansk when it was followed with Caldera. This map is so much better than anything before
[2023-01-06 15:57:09] <%ttvhyper_1> chill teep your gunna hurt some of chats feeling 😂😂
[2023-01-06 15:57:10] <$JusMurkin> Teep, you might want to turn your game filters off because it's flickering in OBS
[2023-01-06 15:57:11] <@%BladeRunnerKing> @Bust3dKnukl3s no cap i remember i tuned into lipp matt's stream once and all he was doing for 15 min straight was camp top airport back in Verdansk, most rattiest, cringe shit ever KEKW

[2023-01-06 15:57:15] <%tickclaps> The BEST part of Dansk was dropping superstore; and when they added the vault downtown
[2023-01-06 15:57:16] <%+allup86> The reason that I like Verdansk so much is bc I hated Caldera equally as much. This map is by far better.

[2023-01-06 15:57:29] <+tommyo1123> @kyote7667 it would make the game play better yes. Obviously other things need to be fixed but with those 3 I believe it will be better.

[2023-01-06 16:16:36] <%mrosswilson> @mrosswilson @Domet Every time Teep gets his second load out for the High Alert perk, he has to pick up his throwing knives and smokes because that load out currently has a different tactical and lethal.  If he added those he wouldn't have to pick them up each time.

[2023-01-06 16:16:59] <!%FatThor66> @Domet it doesn't work on custome class.  Only way to get high alert is get it from a default loadout instead of a custom one.

[2023-01-06 16:17:44] <%Domet> @FatThor66 oh really. i did not know that. i assume that is a bug right? bc vanguard perk package in custom loadouts still has high alert
[2023-01-06 16:17:45] <%ryne_not_ryan> @therealflynnshady it was the clan tag of the guys they killed ICANT

[2023-01-06 18:20:55] <MlsterB00mbastlc> @kweenbdot I think they would all agree that rather have no stream snipers period. Good or bad
[2023-01-06 18:21:03] <%+itsentzy> @dabighutch he likes high alert and dualies better than an smg and no high alert
[2023-01-06 18:21:04] <+Dumpzter> Does Chipotle count as fast food?

[2023-01-06 18:55:10] <@%kush06> Maybe cuz you're always yelling so you get tuned out @Hyperbeam__
[2023-01-06 18:55:10] <%$RAWBisWAR> in the ehat they do its super hard to listen
[2023-01-06 18:55:11] <Minicube45> i remember a clayster clip talking about the urgency of comms
[2023-01-06 18:55:12] <%chuckbuckb0buck> when cloak is locked he's got great comms, i remember wsw
[2023-01-06 18:55:12] <%+mahnster406> urgent all the time is when you see Maven just spinning in circles cause he doesnt know what is more pressing.
[2023-01-06 18:55:18] <@%Hyperbeam__> @kush06 ICANT
[2023-01-06 18:55:19] <@%BladeRunnerKing> and then you got other people who dont comm squat

[2023-01-06 18:55:22] <%OrtegaYea> my squad def stuggles with comms. I call someone out. they die from them and say the callout. IM like i just told you that
[2023-01-06 18:55:24] <%+Lewtherian> Apex call out are 1000x worse than COD comms tho
[2023-01-06 18:55:24] <%+grovey79> The worst is marking everything and anything in game. Ping Ping PING PING

[2023-01-06 20:19:51] <@%^Streamlabs> TeeP enjoys the core gameplay of WZ 2.0. Loves the look and feel of the map. TeeP prefers free loadout to be during 1st circle and more money economy on the map. Hitching/Lagging is an issue as well. TeeP loves the game so far and looks forward to quality of life improvements. TeeP does not know what the exact meta will be for the game, but the meta will probably evolve quickly as it did for WZ 1. TeeP will be using a variety of loadouts. - !guns for more info

[2023-01-06 22:14:45] <+dome_pieces> He 100% challed
[2023-01-06 22:14:50] <%+grovey79> Shooting the dead body is no biggie either, the live marker made it iffy there
[2023-01-06 22:14:56] <!%FatThor66> @Oceanz21 they have new ones we get our kids for snacks that are like raspberry/strawberry.  Delicous.
[2023-01-06 22:14:56] <%$ItsNotThatGross> a little too aggro but very unlucky on that fucking melee lunge lol
[2023-01-06 22:14:57] <%theJurassicPat> from your POV he yelled Leeroy and ran lol
[2023-01-06 22:15:04] <%KylestKyle> he was trying to reverse pressure
[2023-01-06 22:15:05] <%thexrealness> he didnt really chall though
[2023-01-06 22:15:09] <%+gnawtyF0X> Your POV made it seem like I was in-game
[2023-01-06 22:15:09] <+Tbird05> I feel like revive pistols shouldn't end if your teammates die.
[2023-01-06 22:15:12] <%+flipjoe21> what was the main result
[2023-01-06 22:15:13] <%FOSEVENS> 😂
[2023-01-06 22:15:15] <%$TechShotGaming> He probably thought you had Self and not the gun too
[2023-01-06 22:15:15] <%$Oceanz21> @fatthor66 yummmm
[2023-01-06 22:15:22] <%thexrealness> he peakked and got sent

[2023-01-06 22:15:23] <%+xbingkingx> Let's see the VOD
[2023-01-06 22:15:23] <%+heysuschristo> Maven is never really going for kills. He was trying to shoulder the staircase and maybe catch a guy running out
[2023-01-06 22:15:26] <+dome_pieces> He probably figured you hit a bunch of shots on the guy, I would
[2023-01-06 22:15:26] <%+beaverhunter15> shouldve known that guy was there though he saw him run out
[2023-01-06 22:15:27] <+DopeOutdoorsEnt> All I know is I’m running through every door frame elbows out from now on
[2023-01-06 22:15:31] <%+PurpleKushx17> that melee lunge was insane
[2023-01-06 22:15:33] <%+mahnster406> he peaked the door and was backing up to plate and the guy saw his gun and bashed him in the face.
[2023-01-06 22:15:35] <!%GreenBassGuy> Then got bullshitted by the stupid melee in this game
[2023-01-06 22:15:39] <%+xbingkingx> vod review
[2023-01-06 22:15:39] <kingdeuce23> Ur the pro but deploy covers trophy’s look fire for that situation. Or is it excess junk in ur bag?
[2023-01-06 22:15:39] <%+heysuschristo> Yea, i didn't even know that was a thing
[2023-01-06 22:15:40] <%+grovey79> Was he plated? That seemed like 2 melee hits
[2023-01-06 22:15:41] <+PRODiiiG_Y> He was trying to buy time for you to res
[2023-01-06 22:15:45] <+PRODiiiG_Y> But damn that melee lol
[2023-01-06 22:15:46] <Does_Not_Even_Lift> looked like he just wanted to clear the staircase and got melee rushed
[2023-01-06 22:15:52] <$TropicalsBeach> so is Walt Disney
