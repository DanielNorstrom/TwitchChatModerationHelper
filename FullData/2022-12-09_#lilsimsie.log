[2022-12-09 00:00:06] <%Missygirl93> Auto mod likes big Porch better
[2022-12-09 00:00:12] <%andscottie> big deck energy
[2022-12-09 00:00:13] <@%+MrsTomato101814> @ElixirOfEmotions please dont backseat mod! we've got it!
[2022-12-09 00:00:13] <%+fully_caffeinated> I had "duck" autocorrect in a chat message.  sure glad I re-read it before sending.
[2022-12-09 00:00:13] <%$River_Styx19> i remember when certain spices used to be banned in chat for no reason too

[2022-12-09 00:00:17] <%Jeais> Automod gets me a lot, I usually giggle to myself trying to guess the problem
[2022-12-09 00:00:22] <%+snowy_flake> auto mod is sometimes quite something
[2022-12-09 00:00:24] <+rxsmith3> Do you know if you can feed the critters multiple times now? I was able to feed several of them like three times yesterday and I was hoping it isn’t a glitch
[2022-12-09 00:00:25] <@%^Moobot> simsieNo NO, DO THIS! CHANGE THIS! EWWWW! Backseat gaming is NEVER allowed. Suggestions are always appreciated, but do not attempt to make demands or force Kayla to do anything. There is a difference between friendly suggestions and aggressive demands. Ultimately she is the one playing the game, not you! simsieNo
[2022-12-09 00:00:26] <MariposaMoon> im playing not so berry rn!
[2022-12-09 00:00:27] <@%mivyard> @cosmic_riversx22 it's an automated system that can automatically catch messages that might be bad/inappropriate so human moderators can manually approve them!

[2022-12-09 00:00:59] <cosmic_riversx22> @mivyard oh- what is it doing wrong lol?
[2022-12-09 00:01:01] <sunflower_honey_> @river_styx19 auto mod doesn’t season its food unicaLaugh
[2022-12-09 00:01:06] <%kiriokatoji> Yay I have money to donate to simsie
[2022-12-09 00:01:14] <lindsayx0> I don't know what I'm supposed to use instead though. Temporarily not working???
[2022-12-09 00:01:31] <sitdarling> Have you got all the critters yet? I’m after all the foxes
[2022-12-09 00:01:35] <@%mivyard> @cosmic_riversx22 it just catches innocent messages pretty often haha
[2022-12-09 00:01:37] <!+sydknee__> pov: you're a mivmod who doesn't know why we can't say recipe or princess in miv's chat
[2022-12-09 00:01:39] <+FranqlysNumber1Fan> Your reaction to automod was so  loud and it made my baby jump in my belly. Lordy she hasn’t kicked me that hard in a while. Felt like she did a whole roll in there lmao
[2022-12-09 00:01:40] <%zoeanndc> are we raising money for charity all week or am i dreaming about that lol
[2022-12-09 00:01:42] <%42hitch42> @lindsayx0 "made redundant"? lol
[2022-12-09 00:01:45] <mxlbarracin> its the second time i watch you play disney dreamvalley i usually i watch you play sims on youtube
[2022-12-09 00:01:47] <+the_reluctant_craftster> One time I was in a chat where you couldn’t say nuggets
[2022-12-09 00:01:50] <%salty_machela> and dinosaur
[2022-12-09 00:01:50] <+taylor9655> hey chat and kayla! hope y’all are doing great!

[2022-12-09 00:01:51] <cupcakemagic420> This might be a dumb question, but couldn’t people just put spaces in between the letters? Like t h I s?
[2022-12-09 00:01:52] <@%+MrsTomato101814> @lindsayx0 nah, youre fine! we know the context so we approved your message!
[2022-12-09 00:01:54] <kamiskin> Auto mod was just in the good place

[2022-12-09 00:02:09] <+indigoeternity> I remember that
[2022-12-09 00:02:09] <mirificentjoy> @cosmic_riversx22 automod mainly detects some expressions that it considers inappropriate when it's actually not, mainly because it misses context

[2022-12-09 00:02:13] <%afrench1520> when you literally had a sim named pepper

[2022-12-09 00:02:28] <%+EvilKitten47> a sim was named pepper once
[2022-12-09 00:02:30] <%+SimmerClaw> @lilsimsie r u gonna make christmas merch
[2022-12-09 00:02:31] <+CommanderKidGrump> its because weirdos asks girls streamers to take ur shirt off its gross

[2022-12-09 00:02:49] <%Missygirl93> There's 1 word banned in chat forsure..
[2022-12-09 00:02:52] <!+sydknee__> we turned to saying cooking diy or "rest of pee" in miv's chat bc it blocked recipe
[2022-12-09 00:02:53] <@%parsnaps> hello gamers
[2022-12-09 00:02:58] <%afrench1520> those sims, like anna, have been around since march of 2022
[2022-12-09 00:03:03] <cupcakemagic420> @missygirl93 oh I see. So annoying that it even has to be this way 🙄
[2022-12-09 00:03:05] <remy_strips_for_soup> maybe it was detecting "pepper" as "peppa"
[2022-12-09 00:03:06] <@%+MrsTomato101814> also please dont try to get around the bot!!

[2022-12-09 00:03:37] <$bts_loona> i like how you say accused :D
[2022-12-09 00:03:39] <karenam7> WALL-E!

[2022-12-09 00:03:44] <$feastandexist> lmaoo
[2022-12-09 00:03:44] <%Jeais> Yeah people say questionable things on that topic anyway simsieS
[2022-12-09 00:03:45] <kamiskin> I was taught growing up not to accuse people of that but I get it all the time
[2022-12-09 00:03:46] <lindsayx0> the joys of being a woman... everyone assumes you're with child when you order a water at a restaurant
[2022-12-09 00:03:47] <%+reaganh3621> why does everyone assume when someone is sick they think something of it
[2022-12-09 00:03:48] <%+willisx2dan> people can be so annoying
[2022-12-09 00:03:52] <+indigoeternity> so rude
[2022-12-09 00:03:52] <%afrench1520> i always forget when i talk about my sims or people i know irl
[2022-12-09 00:03:52] <+the_reluctant_craftster> Is Stitch in this same update?
[2022-12-09 00:03:56] <%simsbygia> usually its because of quite the opposite
[2022-12-09 00:03:58] <+FranqlysNumber1Fan> Everything is a symptom of that lol
[2022-12-09 00:03:58] <%justRayxox> thats nobodies business until you want to share
[2022-12-09 00:03:58] <%+Abi_Jee> and it's okay that words are banned ^^.

[2022-12-09 00:04:43] <+SG816> It can be a REALLY sensitive issue for some of us for a lot of personal reasons. Never ask someone that
[2022-12-09 00:04:44] <thea_sl> Everytime I see my family, they ask when I'm going to get kids... it's so annoying!

[2022-12-09 00:04:44] <%stripeyhunt> i just got the star path to "harvest something sweet" does anyone know what that means doodle109Comfy
[2022-12-09 00:04:48] <@%mivyard> like thats not ur business randos

[2022-12-09 00:04:54] <%justRayxox> I hate it when strangers think its ok to ask when you're having kids. Its not appropriate conversation
[2022-12-09 00:04:55] <lorettabelleart> super frustrating being a woman
[2022-12-09 00:04:55] <%dawnpenguin> they need to reevaluate their life
[2022-12-09 00:04:55] <%+BeeOMeeGames> Yes!!! I actually am that at the moment and everyone just wants to know every minute detail, and tells me what to do with my body every second. I feel like an incubator. Doesn’t seem to stop even if you are simsieRage

[2022-12-09 00:05:03] <mrsfathalpert> it's just so insensitive. there's so many women who can't or don't want to and people just don't have a filter when it comes to that
[2022-12-09 00:05:06] <kamiskin> I get it like once a month at work
[2022-12-09 00:05:06] <%$Fresca_123> Honestly I would consider pregnancy a tragedy for myself because I really dont want kids lol
[2022-12-09 00:05:07] <%Sventovid> @mivyard Exactly!!! Like if it was they would tell you!
[2022-12-09 00:05:07] <%+love4allpplz> being that would be very bad for me.....hate when ppl dont mind their own business
[2022-12-09 00:05:08] <%+pixiecupcake> People are weird with this stuff, like why do you care?
[2022-12-09 00:05:12] <lindsayx0> a coworker asked me if I was "pregernate". no! I ate a lot of turkey of Thanksgiving! rude!
[2022-12-09 00:05:16] <Care_stars> That topic is so sensitive. No one should ever bring it up unless the woman wants to talk about it
[2022-12-09 00:05:17] <%+smooth_tortoise> Or how you had to block Jeb
[2022-12-09 00:05:19] <%stripeyhunt> @buzz_thebeee OH thank you
[2022-12-09 00:05:20] <%paxxypaxx> it feel so wrong to always think when a woman has something exciting to say they HAVE to be that

[2022-12-09 00:05:47] <%$jacksonpent> its like the most personal thing in the world so you should mever ask
[2022-12-09 00:05:48] <jennybsweeney> It’s like not people’s business
[2022-12-09 00:05:49] <cosmic_riversx22> 100% agree with you
[2022-12-09 00:05:51] <+indigoeternity> it's so rude and inconsiderate
[2022-12-09 00:05:52] <%Missygirl93> Jennifer Anniston had to deal with this her whole career
[2022-12-09 00:05:55] <%ElixirOfEmotions> @ItIsDanya wtf?? men are so wrong and weird

[2022-12-09 00:05:59] <+fragile_nonsense> my MIL still asks me when I'm going to have babies, even though i told her I can't
[2022-12-09 00:06:00] <@%mivyard> pregnancy is like a legitimate phobia for me it sounds HORRIFYING
[2022-12-09 00:06:03] <+indigoeternity> it reduces women to baby makers
[2022-12-09 00:06:04] <mrsd1901> yea i have infertility and have had 2 miscarriages so i hate when people ask me when im having kids because its all i want
[2022-12-09 00:06:05] <%+snowy_flake> if you wouldn't say something to someone in real life don't say it to them on the internet either
[2022-12-09 00:06:06] <mih455> thanks for talking about this, it would be nice if we didn't have to...
[2022-12-09 00:06:07] <mrsfathalpert> @itisdanya unbelievable. I'm so sorry
[2022-12-09 00:06:07] <sunflower_honey_> @itisdanya so such a weird thing to be mad about?? 😭 im sorry that happened though
[2022-12-09 00:06:09] <casually_maddie> One time I puked at work and my boss was like are you preggnat and I was like “omg noooo that’s a nightmare”
[2022-12-09 00:06:09] <%paxxypaxx> its so rude! something like that would never be asked to someone who isnt a woman
[2022-12-09 00:06:09] <%+catkilledcuriosity> People are so weirdly possessive  over women's bodies
[2022-12-09 00:06:11] <%procrasticrafting> be kind and mind your own beeswax!

[2022-12-09 00:06:23] <%+ThatRogueVessa> If you wouldn't like being asked constantly, don't do the same to others. pretty simple
[2022-12-09 00:06:23] <lindsayx0> you could be carrying 4 babies at 8 months and I'd still avoid the topic

[2022-12-09 00:09:15] <!+sydknee__> Hello! I have been following your tweets for the past two days, and have come to the conclusion you do not deserve to have Raymond on your island. He is my comfort character and seeing him in an environment not meant for him brings me anxiety, so I will be expecting a reply to this DM when you have him in boxes and ready to relinquish him to someone who will treasure him like he deserves.

[2022-12-09 00:10:20] <!+sydknee__> Hello! I have been following your tweets for the past two days, and have come to the conclusion you do not deserve to have Raymond on your island. He is my comfort character and seeing him in an environment not meant for him brings me anxiety, so I will be expecting a reply to this DM when you have him in boxes and ready to relinquish him to someone who will treasure him like he deserves.

It can create get things just from you typing in what you want, even houses, or floor plans that you could use for sims 4 vids or streams.
