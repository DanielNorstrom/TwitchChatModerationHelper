[2022-12-11 00:53:15] <!%admiral_frostbite> I mean arguably _everyone_ gets taxed that much since the employers pay the other portion (and adjust salaries accordingly). Self-employed pays both so it just feels extra brutal. To be clear I am definitely not defending it but it's universal.
[2022-12-11 00:53:30] <koleracaput> Taxation is vexation.

She gives her Cup a shake, And laughs until her belly aches. The only other sound's the break, Of distant waves and birds awake.
[2022-12-11 19:51:51] <masked_dragon12235> The Cup is shiny, clean and deep, But she has promises to keep, After cake and lots of sleep. Sweet dreams come to her cheap.  She rises from her gentle bed, With thoughts of kittens in her head, She eats her jam with lots of bread. Ready for the day ahead.

[2022-12-11 20:53:56] <de4dm4nw4lkin> Like if you took all the actors from cats movie and just made them A dress like cats actors, or B VA cg cats. Then make the script more inline and then you have a movie.

[2022-12-11 21:49:37] <%reivehnfliyt> I usually just respond if I am asked by people of a dogmatic faith to just look at how enacting religious "morals" as law goes for the countries that have done so, etc. Iran, Afghanistan, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia's new law banning sexual acts before marriage will just create further ignorance and stigma around consent, safety and understanding.

[2022-12-11 21:56:30] <%reivehnfliyt> personally, I think removing marriage from being a legal thing and instead renaming it like "co-residency" or "co-reliance" in law, just de-religion marriage in government, doesn't mean people can't still get married, just that marriage regardless of religion no longer has legal grounding, so "co-reliance" can't be barred to anyone like homosexuals via religious context, side stepping the issue of gay marriage in a way
[2022-12-11 21:56:33] <%Shinbun> its cuz we respect others opinions i guess

[2022-12-11 22:17:25] <MysticJanus> Very true, language always changes. How we speak now is different from 30-40 years ago and some linguists think English is about due for another big shift.

[2022-12-11 22:18:27] <Abandoned_Bad_DragonToy> So I was just watching a horror movie, the power shut down, I went to look outside if its just me, the light behind door in my uncles house was on but nobody is in there and the light is on movement sensor. It was on cuz the power got back up and it activated it. Worst timing ever that scared the sh*t out of me.

[2022-12-11 22:19:51] <MysticJanus> @FishApp Well, the internet IS affecting English for better or for worse. It depends on which side of the prescriptive/descriptive bracket you sit in.
[2022-12-11 22:19:59] <%reivehnfliyt> but I woke up early and couldn't get back to sleep, I had all up I suppose around six and a half hours sleep, tolerable for a part-time job here

[2022-12-11 22:21:40] <RevSnowfox> heck, Romanian pretty much lost all diacritics ("accent marks") from the language because of computers and internet not supporting them for decades
[2022-12-11 22:21:44] <+ToastyBunzUwU> isn't 8 hours the healthy number?

[2022-12-11 22:22:56] <FishApp> @MysticJanus the lack of boundaries that the internet promotes has been a pretty steep shift in how we speak, imo. I think there's almost as many words recognized in English today borrowed from Japanese as there is French now.

[2022-12-11 22:25:02] <MysticJanus> @FishApp I don't think we're quite there yet with loan words from Japanese as we are with French. There are a whole lot more French words in our vocabulary than we realize since we take them for granted.

[2022-12-11 22:36:52] <%AslanGrants> They're basically stacking extremely high infant mortality against an actual average lifespan of 60
[2022-12-11 22:37:00] <MysticJanus> @FishApp Yeah, because haute cuisine isn't something that is very prominent in the US, as you said, is hasn't been that way for quite some time now.

[2022-12-11 22:42:47] <White_Blaze> @nojouplays nope. it was 13, and that was 50 or so years ago in some states. and that's was only ever with written permission from the parents of the child.  --but even then it wasn't like a 13 year old was getting married off to someone 20 years older then themself. and i believe that was only ever legalized for things like pre-aranged marriages, cause that was still a common practice back then even in the states. its not so much a thing these days here in the US - but it is in some other count

[2022-12-11 23:12:04] <%Achievement_Goblin> it supposed to be 2 parts played by two people cellist. There is a bit that doing by yourself is a 11/10 challenge
[2022-12-11 23:12:08] <%$shadowsneverdie_> basically there's a point in the song where they are in it , and the arppegios that are played in the song span over the 4 strings at reallly far lengths - kinda like rachhmaninoff i cant spell his name lol
[2022-12-11 23:12:18] <%reivehnfliyt> Noodle, To me you come across as an example of an excellent role-model. and in a way i'm sad to say i'm impressed because that expectation should be a given. The minimum a person should be expected to be is considerate and welcoming of difference.
