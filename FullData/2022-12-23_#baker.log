[2022-12-23 00:28:07] <+bunnycups1> what are the main attributes i should focus on for being a bard, im new.
[2022-12-23 00:28:30] <@%ragingqueen666> @bunnycups1 swiftness and spec, spec for buff damage and swift for couldown (you other go full spec or full swiftness) and the one that isnt the priority is only on neck
[2022-12-23 00:28:42] <+bunnycups1> Anything else?
[2022-12-23 00:28:48] <%+TrickmasteH> only bottom 3 matter, and its not a cheese its just simple method
[2022-12-23 00:29:10] <@%ragingqueen666> @bunnycups1 if you are new go full swiftness and spec on neck (no other stats are good)
[2022-12-23 00:29:25] VIEWERS: 511

[2022-12-23 21:30:33] <%+Hi_Im_JJ> So here's the better question, do I keep saving for my level 10 gem (about 2 weeks away from buying it) while the 10 gems are cheap and THEN hone the pally or the other way around Hmm
[2022-12-23 21:30:46] VIEWERS: 504
[2022-12-23 21:31:54] <+TheJuan> @ragingqueen666 maybe i have to try it again dunno.
[2022-12-23 21:32:04] <%+Hi_Im_JJ> Nah no express. I used the new one on Reaper. But I already have 6 gold earners so he won't make me any gold short term. It'll only be to get relic set earlier
[2022-12-23 21:32:07] <hoodidupeh> btw baker sell your blue stones for 7
[2022-12-23 21:32:09] <hoodidupeh> ppl cant do math
[2022-12-23 21:32:36] <%+Hi_Im_JJ> I think I wait because I'd have to gear him as well so getting him to 60 would probably be like 100k with gear.
