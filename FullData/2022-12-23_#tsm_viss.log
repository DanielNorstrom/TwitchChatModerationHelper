[2022-12-23 18:23:16] <t3h_f0x> whats weird is it shoots a 5.7, which is known to be fucking deadly as shit from most ranges, it also has the fast ass fire rate so it should technically rip

[2022-12-23 19:23:51] <ShermanJames> It isn't JUST Matt Ryan. As a colts fan we have never had good O lines to protect QBs. Manning was a king at getting the ball out quick. The offense is still built for that cause the same guys are in charge up top. Ballard needs to go along with the rest of the coaching staff and maybe we can start to rebuild.
