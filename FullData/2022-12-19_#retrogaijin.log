[2022-12-19 10:25:05] <Guomi> This might be GOTY in concept, if the dev really used to make lootboxes for FIFA
[2022-12-19 10:25:12] <$BrittaNeko> I agree with Retro. 🤷‍♀️
[2022-12-19 10:25:16] <Guomi> Or redemption of the year anyway

[2022-12-19 10:29:10] <CoryFTWs> she can go to osu
[2022-12-19 10:29:14] <$yuckyarmadillo> it does suck, I did long distance with my fiancee during uni days, so def do-able but was hard
[2022-12-19 10:29:17] <TheEyesofSyn> awww, that's sweet, I mean, you can visit her! Either way, I hope things go well! You two make a great team!
[2022-12-19 10:29:19] <ShowtimeTylers> I see thats why you chose Ohio, cool.
[2022-12-19 10:29:31] <%+nashymedz> What college was she thinking out here in Cali?
[2022-12-19 10:29:36] <TheEyesofSyn> that you're communicating about it so openly is important and fantastic :D
[2022-12-19 10:29:41] <%+RubyRose2077> imagen she goes to THE ohio state university. make a buckeye of her LUL
[2022-12-19 10:29:46] <%nunienunie> go buckeyes
[2022-12-19 10:29:51] <ShowtimeTylers> either way, long distance relationships can totally work and in the grand scheme one year isn't 'that' long

[2022-12-19 13:07:11] <%Shivalla> Burke ends around these times or hour later. Basically just because Cohh starts then. So Burke is generally a waiting room in a sense for Cohh. @phelagor

[2022-12-19 13:07:48] <DeeperShadeOfPurple> @Zeros93 as far as I know, no green cards in Japan even if you marry Japanese
[2022-12-19 13:07:49] <ColonelSanders2022> I only watch Retro for big streamers
[2022-12-19 13:07:58] <%Phelagor> Shivalla, yep for instance cohh starts in like an hour. I usually watch em when retro ends.

[2022-12-19 15:51:13] <VrtniPatuljak> zenlay nah. they already plagiarized the old republic and called it high republic
[2022-12-19 15:51:23] <%zenlay> would explain how he is that powerfull in the force
[2022-12-19 15:51:33] <%+Mr_Kevin01> lmao
[2022-12-19 15:51:34] <BakaBryanBC> got a lockpick

[2022-12-19 15:51:43] <%GGuts> wild guess
[2022-12-19 15:51:44] <%+Mr_Kevin01> he's powerful because he's literally a creation of the force
[2022-12-19 15:51:45] <VrtniPatuljak> zenlay pretty sure palps made him in a lab
[2022-12-19 15:51:48] <veloxmors> workaholics I think

[2022-12-19 15:52:22] <%+Mr_Kevin01> anakin was created by the force to stop palp, he is quite literally space jesus
[2022-12-19 15:52:30] <chillarz> lol
[2022-12-19 15:52:30] <%zenlay> VrtniPatuljak  after what i know high republic is 300-400 years befor ep 1 and old republic is like 1-2 k years

[2022-12-19 15:54:30] <%+AgonyAndShame> Too many Jedis, had to get them killed first. No balance.
[2022-12-19 15:54:30] <VrtniPatuljak> then horses rode the star destroyers
[2022-12-19 15:54:31] <brothermanhobo> space wizardssssssss
[2022-12-19 15:54:31] <KingOfRedNames> star wars after the OT atpCap
[2022-12-19 15:54:32] <crashion00> ummm, anakin was just to bring balance to the force
[2022-12-19 15:54:38] <%ZombieDodgeKing> from my point of view the jedi are evil
[2022-12-19 15:54:42] <%+Mr_Kevin01> yeah yoda was alive during the high republic
[2022-12-19 15:54:45] <+Tinsei1> without anakin there could be no luke
[2022-12-19 15:54:57] <crashion00> exactly
[2022-12-19 15:55:00] <KPVader> Star Wars is for nerds
[2022-12-19 15:55:07] <%zenlay> @Mr_Kevin01 yoda is op

[2022-12-19 15:56:52] <!%Emodecon> had a friend that tried to convince me that fantasy like starwars isnt good, but startrek could be real in the future so its not fantasy
[2022-12-19 15:56:54] <crashion00> i feel like star wars is more real, while star trek is for children with good moral lessons in life

[2022-12-19 15:58:40] <chillarz> bibi with these fireballs
[2022-12-19 15:58:41] <@%NallePops> Cleric can revive.. one use.. but have to have enough knowledge normally
[2022-12-19 15:58:43] <chillarz> lol
[2022-12-19 15:58:43] <Dr__D> With the memory changes they might not have it available though
[2022-12-19 15:58:46] <%$Zencodion> @NallePops retroWOW
[2022-12-19 15:58:48] <%devisrain> but they are memory locked out of it by default unless they redo there spell list which leaves them with like one heal and the res only
[2022-12-19 15:58:59] <+Tinsei1> it has a high spell capacity, so you can only bring on heal spell with you
[2022-12-19 15:59:01] <%zenlay> NallePops  is a legend

[2022-12-19 15:59:22] <gamez_brown> yeah, you dont normally have enough spell slots by default so you gotta do some configuring
[2022-12-19 15:59:24] <VrtniPatuljak> you get 12 spell points. Rez is 8 so its fukt
[2022-12-19 15:59:25] <%$Zencodion> @NallePops retroCUDDLE , i can now retroYAY again
[2022-12-19 15:59:32] <%zenlay> NallePops  living legend then :P
[2022-12-19 15:59:38] <Dr__D> Each spell uses a certain amount of points I think
[2022-12-19 15:59:45] <@%NallePops> @Zencodion Welcome home retroLOVE Good to have you back on the emotes
[2022-12-19 15:59:48] <%+AgonyAndShame> Reminds me of playing Icewind Dale way back with friends, one friend played a monk with improved evasion which enabled him to avoid damage from area spells with successful saving throws. So he ran into the middle of a group of enemies and aggroed them, I started spamming fireballs...
[2022-12-19 15:59:48] <%devisrain> Gear with knowledge is god tier for cleric.
[2022-12-19 15:59:49] <chillarz> LUL
[2022-12-19 15:59:52] <!%Emodecon> msalex1Old
[2022-12-19 15:59:53] <Dr__D> So you can take spells to equal up to X amount of points based on your knowledge(?)
[2022-12-19 16:00:11] <gamez_brown> each spell has a certain tier, the tiers take up certain amounts of spell slots - clerics start with 12 slots and rez takes up 7 more slots than is allotted
[2022-12-19 16:00:11] <%$Zencodion> @NallePops FeelsStrongMan
[2022-12-19 16:00:14] <+Leader_of_Germany> I bet you'd enjoy wizard and doing massive damage, blowing everyone up :)
[2022-12-19 16:00:20] <VrtniPatuljak> RetroGaijin try wizard. see what the fuss is about

[2022-12-19 16:00:46] <gamez_brown> rogue ranger are the tests favorites for solo players
[2022-12-19 16:00:47] <brothermanhobo> Wizard def highest dps, but rogue is nutty
[2022-12-19 16:00:57] <R41D3NZ> trade off is wizard has like zero health
[2022-12-19 16:01:03] <+Sieglarm> try it and you will understand
[2022-12-19 16:01:09] <gamez_brown> i dont think wizard is highest dps, its still rogue/ranger
[2022-12-19 16:01:09] <VrtniPatuljak> you CAN do all of that theoretically. realistically you get stabbed by a rogue LUL
[2022-12-19 16:01:14] <@%NallePops> yeah i think the Wiz invis compared to the Rogue invis is a bit OP... Rogue should have 10 steps in invis as generel invis skill..
[2022-12-19 16:01:16] <gamez_brown> just a lot of versatility

[2022-12-19 16:01:42] <brothermanhobo> Rogue and ranger are single target
[2022-12-19 16:01:48] <Dr__D> Yeah it feels weird that wiz gets a better invis than rogue
[2022-12-19 16:01:49] <R41D3NZ> faith shouldn't rez, health is too low
[2022-12-19 16:01:52] <R41D3NZ> can't rez
[2022-12-19 16:01:54] <Bigwigg221> it costs health
[2022-12-19 16:01:56] <BakaBryanBC> Needed more health
[2022-12-19 16:02:01] <chillarz> i thinkn it takes a %  of their hp to res
[2022-12-19 16:02:13] <@%NallePops> it does cost health.. so would be smart not the cleric do it
[2022-12-19 16:02:39] <@%NallePops> cause the cleric cant do big heals on self.
