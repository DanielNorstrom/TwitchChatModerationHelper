[2022-12-16 12:10:53] <!%Gemsplitter> and then time for last boss on heroic times 4 or whatever
[2022-12-16 12:11:00] <hiwago> idk why echo is all offline still tho? thought they start at 8am or whatever?
[2022-12-16 12:11:38] <smoochsmoochy> maybe trouble at the venue?

[2022-12-16 12:12:46] <!%Gemsplitter> probably not streaming heroic last boss
[2022-12-16 12:12:58] <!%Gemsplitter> or just watching discussing shit
[2022-12-16 12:13:03] <hiwago> ah right ye they did have last boss splits left to do
[2022-12-16 12:13:39] <!%Gemsplitter> i mean limit released video right and bdgg has already done some of their splits
[2022-12-16 12:13:49] <+puttputtx> did they turn in the aiding the accord quest?
[2022-12-16 12:13:55] <smoochsmoochy> well, liquid is already 4 bosses in
[2022-12-16 12:14:13] <!%Gemsplitter> so no reason not to stream but maybe they try and figure out how to do more heroic splits
[2022-12-16 12:14:36] <!%Gemsplitter> 4bosses in doesn't really matter all about last boss

[2022-12-16 20:32:23] <+Vaeny> true and factual
[2022-12-16 20:32:34] <+Vaeny> (council ebola spreader)
[2022-12-16 20:32:53] <!%Reddy> the thing is
[2022-12-16 20:32:58] <Nexxalys> i always thought momentum was the greatest thing since dh released and then they fucked dh to spam cs with random fury generation and blade dance on cd :x
[2022-12-16 20:33:01] <!%Reddy> momentum is fun 1 extension per 5 years
[2022-12-16 20:33:12] <Nexxalys> I do think its problematic on many bosses though
[2022-12-16 20:33:12] <!%Reddy> other than that
[2022-12-16 20:33:14] <!%Reddy> this is omega shit

[2022-12-16 20:48:21] <+Shirk88> I just don‚Äôt like it. Feels super clunky and I hate watching an extra timer constantly on TG, pooling fury, etc. Much easier and less annoying to just use a 20-sec CD with GT

[2022-12-16 21:28:02] <Glumey> its shit
[2022-12-16 21:28:37] <Glumey> if u play havoc u have to accept using movement skills to dps
[2022-12-16 21:28:40] <Glumey> or just reroll
[2022-12-16 21:30:27] <ziphertv> i think momentum is more skill based, and its more fun when you are good at it
[2022-12-16 21:31:17] <Glumey> then get good at it, momentum rn is piss easy compared to legion momentum
[2022-12-16 21:31:31] <ziphertv> yea, im having hella fun playing momentum actually

[2022-12-16 22:53:13] <&Strifelol> Are we going to see a big spike in damage when we get our 2/4pc?
[2022-12-16 22:53:31] <&Strifelol> It feels like we're pretty avg in terms of overall damage
[2022-12-16 22:53:50] <&Strifelol> Yeah
[2022-12-16 22:53:59] <erabohmer> DH still your favourite class so far?>
[2022-12-16 22:54:31] <FightingSodomyt> so whats going on now
[2022-12-16 22:54:32] <&Strifelol> I'm currently running tempest build because I really don't like momentum but I was wondering how much of a difference it is in terms of numbers
[2022-12-16 22:54:43] <&Strifelol> Sims say it's like 1k difference x.x
[2022-12-16 22:54:55] <!%Guukkii> there u have it then
[2022-12-16 22:54:57] <!%Guukkii> 1k difference
[2022-12-16 22:56:08] <&Strifelol> But that's assuming near perfect momentum play right?
[2022-12-16 22:56:40] <&Strifelol> It's a bitch to play on Dathea
[2022-12-16 22:57:08] <Nexxalys> if you have less problem using something you will always perform better with small difference in sims
[2022-12-16 22:57:20] <Nexxalys> sims are perfect, yeah
[2022-12-16 22:57:23] <&Strifelol> I guess on heroic it's just super hectic because of the size of the groups
[2022-12-16 22:58:13] <erabohmer> wild how hard rasz is on heroic tbh
[2022-12-16 22:58:34] <+mukzington> Jimmy bro - just kill it now pls. Kill next try and I use my free twitch prime thing
