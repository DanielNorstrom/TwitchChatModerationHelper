[2023-01-05 13:32:53] <ScarredVulcan> If I remember right, Biotech didn't actually introduce a new ending, with the point of the mod itself being expanding lifespans of colonies on the Rim through Genetics or Mechanoid assistance.

[2023-01-05 13:46:28] <ToddVO> Hard to say if neanderthals were smarter or not. But they did not have the numbers or, apparently, aggression of homo sapiens.
[2023-01-05 13:47:20] <vanivan239586038183905213> @ToddVO i dont think there's a way to tell how aggressive they were. we can judge based on their tool making and left over cultural relics how smart they were tho. just what i remember from anthropology classes in uni tho, not an expert

[2023-01-05 13:49:14] <vanivan239586038183905213> @ToddVO i dont doubt it, but when you look at bird vs mammal brains for example; bird brains are much much smaller but have much better performance cause there's selective pressure on them to be as efficient as poss with what they got. so not indicative of intelligence

[2023-01-05 14:48:41] <vanivan239586038183905213> i mean archotech is almost certainly heavily based on nanomachines, so it can probably restructure on what we would call cellular level. that's how it heals and adapts to tasks

[2023-01-05 15:52:21] <%Brynjarbjorn> Old French "bacinet" does mean "little basin" so I guess the helmet, being a "close fitting" one, was named after that. Which then created this basinet/bascinet/bassinet spectrum.

[2023-01-05 16:58:22] <%derping_dutch> @2DKiri No. It's just the game derping out from time to time. Some previous order just blocked the capture order. It's not clear to me on how to fix it. Other than reloading the game.

[2023-01-05 17:10:53] <ToddVO> A friend used to live near Washington, DC, and said that one winter, it started snowing very lightly, and the highway turned into a parking lot. People were getting out of their cars and walking away.
[2023-01-05 17:11:23] <torlack> Back when I lived in the southern US, that once a year snow usually came with some  ice.  That is a nightmare no matter where you live.
