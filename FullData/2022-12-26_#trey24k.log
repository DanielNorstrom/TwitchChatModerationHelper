They are unable to distinguish between reality and imaginative events. These unusual experiences seem real to the person whereas others assume that the person is lost in their own world.

He creates the HOA's and maanages them. What he does is he takes a 5 foot by 5 foot plot of land and deeds it to the other neighboorhood and by law since there is land own by another HOA that has no access then a company by law has to management both HOA's  and gets paid a fee yearly to do it.

[2022-12-26 19:46:00] <%$tim50kgg> Cheer100   Heres the best twitch troll story. Girl streamer had the title, Just got back from BHVR. Someone asked what the f is BHVR, instead of answering she makes fun of the guy and bans him for being stupid. The answer is that it was the developer for the game she was playing. The guy goes on 4chan, gets a ton of ppl to make new accounts named wtfisbhvr1, wtfisbhvr2, wtfisbhvr3 and kept dono'ing 100 bits to text to speech wtf is bhvr. She quit early and didnt stream for 3 weeks.

[2022-12-26 21:26:37] <+Maver1ck3dge> Nikita did say they wanted everything to be a surprise. But with how long it took to get Lightkeeper and Streets in the game, maybe they held back too much
