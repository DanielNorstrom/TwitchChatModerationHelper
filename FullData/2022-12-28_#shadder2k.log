[2022-12-28 20:59:15] <xversone> did he shoot at ana
[2022-12-28 20:59:16] <hieh_> From a non cheating POV he justs aiming at a wall constantly
[2022-12-28 20:59:18] <CamiloSC30> is always pointing to the face
[2022-12-28 20:59:20] <rambo_ow> yes the first tracer kill was toggling on

[2022-12-28 20:59:27] <NanComand> and why she doesnt use ult? ^^
[2022-12-28 20:59:27] <+Shufflevvs> as he still not used ult
[2022-12-28 20:59:33] <NanComand> thats my biggest question
[2022-12-28 20:59:34] <+yayza> why isnt he ulting
[2022-12-28 20:59:34] <bananstol> not cheating
[2022-12-28 20:59:36] <%$‰∏ªÊí≠Â´ÅÊàë (dracala31)> not like hacking for me

[2022-12-28 20:59:46] <rambo_ow> hes never ulting
[2022-12-28 20:59:48] <CamiloSC30> up close, he does not have the same aim
[2022-12-28 20:59:50] <kingxtr3m3> smoothing
[2022-12-28 20:59:51] <+ChiefCrispyNips> @hieh_ thats how you hold angles
[2022-12-28 20:59:55] <Tazer31> Hmm
[2022-12-28 20:59:57] <sn0ips> it looks normal idk
[2022-12-28 20:59:57] <+zooM_cs> he looked up at widow before peeking
[2022-12-28 21:00:00] <MosquitoTV> they look unnatural to me
[2022-12-28 21:00:00] <%susheerolls> Clueless hmmm
[2022-12-28 21:00:06] <NanComand> she has like 5min ult now xd
[2022-12-28 21:00:08] <nec_9> the difference between free shots and hard shots make it obvious
[2022-12-28 21:00:09] <+autumnKouyou> i think he‚Äôs walling but definitely not aimbotting
[2022-12-28 21:00:14] <+roguecrafter2k> it's too big of a coincidence that he always locks on behind walls
[2022-12-28 21:00:16] <AcogSens83> prefire very common widow gameplay
[2022-12-28 21:00:16] <kingxtr3m3> possibly aim assist cheat
[2022-12-28 21:00:18] <+zooM_cs> i was gonna ask if he has ult popped but he looked up before seeing widow
[2022-12-28 21:00:20] <NanComand> no not 5 min but 2 mins ult at least
[2022-12-28 21:00:30] <nekonights> why woudnt he ult if widow in other team is ulting
[2022-12-28 21:00:33] <+OniMalice> ana just died tho
