[2023-01-04 06:14:16] <solarcook> Yay gatekeeping
[2023-01-04 06:14:20] <capsaicinJT> kinda toxic and gatekeepy
[2023-01-04 06:14:23] <%Sasam> I don't even get why they're removing old already verified runs though like, you don't have to look at those anymore
[2023-01-04 06:14:31] <Froob> Like I get not accepting like say...12+ hour just vod records with a timer, but that kinda shit is disgusting

[2023-01-04 06:14:48] <!%BigKaruge> the spreadsheet kills me to think about
[2023-01-04 06:14:52] <Froob> Why do they decide whats fast enough in speedrunning...? Not everything needs to be WR pace lmao
[2023-01-04 06:14:52] <unknownabysss> hello froob
[2023-01-04 06:15:02] <+LazyInvaderShiya> I think people forget that speedrunning is just for fun
[2023-01-04 06:15:07] <!%DECosmic> honestly we don't even gotta get into whether or not this is gatekeeping (it is, for the record), it's just straight up not allowed by SRC lol.
[2023-01-04 06:15:17] <solarcook> Name change for Froob Macguffin?!?!
[2023-01-04 06:15:18] <+Moikazzz> so if you can even went to check if your run is worth it, you'll become a joke for those douches? good to know :')

[2023-01-04 06:15:20] <LonerHero> ^
[2023-01-04 06:15:33] <@%SatoriEarth> @froob they legit removed old runs only 30mins off WR already
[2023-01-04 06:15:34] <+LazyInvaderShiya> you mean the mods can't do there job?
[2023-01-04 06:15:41] <@%H1pp0__> this doesn't happen on the re4VR board maxyySmile
[2023-01-04 06:15:46] <Froob> @SatoriEarth The actual FUCK lmao
[2023-01-04 06:15:47] <$RATTRocka> geez. that's wack
[2023-01-04 06:15:48] <!%DECosmic> one of them learned Excel and was like, "guys I got a fuckin' sick idea"

[2023-01-04 06:16:22] <!%DECosmic> it absolutely is
[2023-01-04 06:16:24] <LonerHero> Correct
[2023-01-04 06:16:31] <%Sasam> From the outside it looks like a bunch of WR holders got mod and decided they didn't want new competition coming in
[2023-01-04 06:16:36] <%ThatAllFrosty> would it be possible to have the current mod team reprimanded for this then?
[2023-01-04 06:16:38] VIEWERS: 249
[2023-01-04 06:16:45] <!%DECosmic> @ThatAllFrosty definitely
[2023-01-04 06:16:46] <capsaicinJT> i mean if they wanna say "we will not verify a 20 hour run" thats one thing, but if someone did a valid run and they were actually making a real attempt, it should be given a chance
[2023-01-04 06:17:03] <solarcook> Re4 is srsfknbzns
[2023-01-04 06:17:19] <%BullseyeDuck> Have the appropriate people been made aware of this situation? maxyyW
[2023-01-04 06:17:29] <%Sasam> also removing old WRs destroys the Statistics WR history function of the board
[2023-01-04 06:17:35] <!%DECosmic> ^^^^^
[2023-01-04 06:17:36] <solarcook> @bullseyeduck yes nobody has been made aware
[2023-01-04 06:17:43] <LonerHero> Boards are meant like archives of insane game's history development rather than just measuring biggest e contest.
[2023-01-04 06:17:52] <%ThatAllFrosty> @Sasam yeah makes it kind of ridiculous
[2023-01-04 06:18:02] <%ThatAllFrosty> that they deleted old runs

[2023-01-04 06:45:46] <%Sasam> my favourite mod slander story is I requested mod for a game I had run years prior because I saw people running it and I got the acceptance over night and woke up to someone claiming I stole the board and was squatting on it and should give it up to "actual runners" I had WR by over 20 minutes and when I pointed it out the other runner changed their vod to "former WR" even though as my run was 2 years old, their 1 day old run was never WR.
[2023-01-04 06:46:39] <%Sasam> It was Secrets of Raetikon, it was an absolute meme game no one runs (though someone did recently and found some skips so that's cool)

[2023-01-04 07:45:31] <%danejerus> glitches make some games into great speedruns and they make some games into awful speedruns. depends entirely on the game

[2023-01-04 10:43:29] <+Selverya> there was a series of gamedev on I don't remember which website who were reacting to speedrun of their own games and some were like "maybe we should put messages out of bond for speedrunners only"

[2023-01-04 10:52:11] <risk907> the launches are insanely rng heavy like 1/100 tries which is why people hate them

[2023-01-04 10:52:32] <!+DemonicRobots> On the bright side, the dev probably made bank off of this game.

[2023-01-04 11:16:03] <$Fina2112> MarcnificentTV is very good, and has an acoustic kit. you could probably ask him for some pointers.
[2023-01-04 11:16:15] <$Fina2112> He does exactly what you're talking about.

[2023-01-04 11:16:59] <%$woodmaster437> amok would be a ok band name
[2023-01-04 11:17:11] <bbfmd> so does anyone know whats going on with the glitch? or is it just getting abused at this point, like is the car trying to flatten itself?

[2023-01-04 12:43:16] <+Joel_White> DLSS 3 can take CPU-intensive games like Microsoft Flight Simulator and more than double the frame rate from around 60fps to 135fps which is pretty impressive for a game that‚Äôs a tremendous resource hog. My personal favorite, Spider-Man Miles Morales, is shown running at nearly 200fps with raytracing on.

[2023-01-04 12:43:31] <DrFiremanPC> Yeah at the Obscure Speedrun Club we sometimes get developer who are glad someone is speedrunning their game, it's fun.
[2023-01-04 12:43:34] <emmab_88> if i was dev i'd be excited but embarrassed. but they probs had no budget so it's pretty good considering
[2023-01-04 12:44:12] <+Joel_White> Fuck man it‚Äôs worth the asking price for a 4090 tbh
[2023-01-04 12:44:18] <@%Poddo__> DLSS 3 is quite literally fake it till you make it

[2023-01-04 13:08:00] <emmab_88> but for launch runners it's like 99% mental fortitude. doesn't matter what you do. for the optimisers at least you can point to mistakes.
[2023-01-04 13:08:00] <nerdingputik> i remember the bloodborne WR attempts by runners before.. the lunch skip was so RNG... but it shaves of a decent amount of time... so i guess risk vs reward eh?

[2023-01-04 13:08:05] <SoulsideJourney_> the launches are so shit that I reckon even if someone gets one in a run it won't be nearly an optimal launch
[2023-01-04 13:08:27] <+NervyDestroyer> I dunno, based on what I've been seeing, I doubt someone will hit this without some better setup.

[2023-01-04 13:11:33] <D_Art_Drawing> @shadowk222 Well that mean if you do great clean run. That even somebody with good run would still be behind you. Even if anybody find to do it more consistent It would not be the guy who is use it to get WR. Am i run. It would be easier to just learn the skip after somebody find out and use it in his cleaned run. Because there is not that much time.
[2023-01-04 13:11:33] <$Fina2112> smh my head cmon maxy

[2023-01-04 13:21:36] <FraserQuest> Some speedrun game communities are pretty chill
[2023-01-04 13:21:37] <shadowk222> @D_Art_Drawing there are also multiple people that could relatively easily get wr with this skip, when they get it
[2023-01-04 13:21:38] <D_Art_Drawing> @shadowk222 Well, if that so. Then everybody just looking for another strats to get that reward. Thanks for info. :)

A popular souls streamer accused another of splicing on questionable evidence, when shown how he might have been wrong, he wouldn 't back down, even though most people agreed the evidence disproved the cheating claim. Lost a lot of fans and friends from that.

[2023-01-04 13:48:33] <spikepsych> this does look almost like the only way would be to just grind runs until you get one with the perfect launch

[2023-01-04 13:48:35] <+Cammdenn> would you say this is the hardest launch?
[2023-01-04 13:48:35] <LiminalKei> It's just finding that middle point between not enough speed and becoming an astronaut
[2023-01-04 13:48:37] <spikepsych> which is pretty toxic
[2023-01-04 13:48:38] <D_Art_Drawing> I think that Tarja or Sharon from Whitin Temtation would be able to sing Opera.
[2023-01-04 13:48:39] <shadowk222> it'd probably good to do it at least once, because the air movement is supposed to be a bit tricky, with the right speed

[2023-01-04 13:53:06] <+ZombXGaming> Maybe it can be judged how the launch will go by how the player is positioned inside of the car when exiting, like how they are standing inside? Idk if this is known or not, I've got no idea, just my input

[2023-01-04 13:54:36] <D_Art_Drawing> @Soccer_WHOvian First someone would have accident after map opened. After that people would want to replicate and after that they would looking for places where can be also done. That is my guess.

[2023-01-04 14:07:20] <+Strife_The_Historian> does it have to be that specific car? Or i guess it's not a GTA-like and you can't pick up other people's cars?

[2023-01-04 14:11:52] <„ÇÑ„ÇãÊ∞ó‰∏çË∂≥ (sakasha)> I assume the camera 'tunneling' is to simulate speed in this game, but I don't understand why since at no point do you move faster than a disabled snail throughout the whole game
[2023-01-04 14:12:29] <D_Art_Drawing> Is this game has the same engine as Mafia 2?
[2023-01-04 14:12:30] <+Con_IV> @„ÇÑ„ÇãÊ∞ó‰∏çË∂≥ It's because of the engine, not the game itself lol
[2023-01-04 14:12:36] <DuckyBert> @„ÇÑ„ÇãÊ∞ó‰∏çË∂≥ maybe a remnant of Unreal Engine
[2023-01-04 14:12:40] <Sovamorco> @„ÇÑ„ÇãÊ∞ó‰∏çË∂≥ probably built into engine the dev used
[2023-01-04 14:12:41] <shadowk222> @„ÇÑ„ÇãÊ∞ó‰∏çË∂≥ i would assume they didn't write the engine themselves
[2023-01-04 14:12:54] <wozzezz> I don't know how you guys can endure speedrunning this game for so long, watching is already painful enough

[2023-01-04 14:13:33] <gracefulartorias> Ik this is outta nowhere but is there any music genres u really dont like
[2023-01-04 14:13:50] <+Strife_The_Historian> Unreal Engine works out that way ye. Also it's not a camera tunneling effect, it's just what happens when the FOV increases too much, which i assume here is because the camera goes too far away from the actor
[2023-01-04 14:13:57] <+Strife_The_Historian> the camera just inverts entirely
[2023-01-04 14:14:18] <+ZombXGaming> What if you lean the car slightly left on the hill instead, it might do something different since the torso would be in the car, but still not too far in.
[2023-01-04 14:14:29] <D_Art_Drawing> @BigDilGamer First Ascendant was out on Beta. I could say there was problems with compatibility. But do not know if that was a problem of developers or the engine itself.

[2023-01-04 14:38:10] <+ZombXGaming> Do we know which parts of the car have collision? From what I see, I think the wheel has full collision and flings you or the car, while the body of the car doesn't do anything for the fling, just pushes itself away to stop colliding with the player. Maybe it would be best to position yourself on the wheel, but slightly away from center in the direction of the mansion so that it pushes you out that way?
[2023-01-04 14:38:12] <+dubramaster> yea im also wondering - how far are you supposed to shoot right here?

[2023-01-04 14:40:14] <+dubramaster> holy shit
[2023-01-04 14:40:18] <+Con_IV> At some point its going to be pointless to practice, might as well just do runs until the final day and hope you hit it
[2023-01-04 14:40:24] <+dubramaster> bro - wow
[2023-01-04 14:40:58] <+dubramaster> god damn him
[2023-01-04 14:41:04] <shadowk222> @Con_IV that's what people so now
[2023-01-04 14:41:07] <SoulsideJourney_> it's a bit of a shame that the skips are really unreliable, because they look pretty cool and really flashy
[2023-01-04 14:41:16] <ItheApologist> Lol that map is so long
[2023-01-04 14:41:16] <+dubramaster> but i saw how far you went - wow

[2023-01-04 14:41:50] <shadowk222> @Con_IV but air control is tricky and it's worth to have done it at least once
[2023-01-04 14:42:09] <bobomb6> so this launches you across the map. is it the car that sends you flying?
[2023-01-04 14:42:35] <+dubramaster> this is wild what people have found in this game lol
[2023-01-04 14:42:36] <D_Art_Drawing> cock skip is also some kind of consistent. Is not it?
[2023-01-04 14:42:38] <+ZombXGaming> I think its the wheels that fling you

[2023-01-04 14:45:59] <bobomb6> with all the skips, what time is possible?
[2023-01-04 14:46:02] <+Con_IV> log is worse apparently
[2023-01-04 14:46:13] <shadowk222> yeah but it saves like a minute more with cone
[2023-01-04 14:46:14] <+Con_IV> because of how hard it is to even get on the log
[2023-01-04 14:46:35] <shadowk222> it is but people try log anyway

[2023-01-04 14:47:49] <+ZombXGaming> why do you m9ve the car down when it goes up to the fence?
[2023-01-04 14:47:53] <+kasiya13> my theory for this is that the car launches if your center of gravity is outside the bounds of the car (wheels probably?). I don't feel like buying the game just to test it though
[2023-01-04 14:48:14] <Lets_Go_Raichu> I need all the COPIUM I can get roo1 roo2 roo3
[2023-01-04 14:48:16] <+FinkHD> What does opening the map do?
[2023-01-04 14:48:50] <Archmagus> GL on the challenge gamer sophWave Just wanted to say thanks for taking a stand before, the scene doesn't need that stuff
[2023-01-04 14:48:57] <derpandaz> they say it simlates a higher FPS
[2023-01-04 14:49:00] <+dubramaster> does holding the map open longer launch you further? or maybe not opening it as long might shoot you further?
[2023-01-04 14:49:03] <shadowk222> it slows down the game, so you get artificially more fps
[2023-01-04 14:49:04] <derpandaz> in map mode verything is kind of slow oation
[2023-01-04 14:49:10] <+kasiya13> height and lateral distance probably has to do with the angle of the car on the hill, hence the reversing a bit helping. you probably need to aim for 45¬∞
[2023-01-04 14:49:11] <ItheApologist> It looks like it slows down time?
[2023-01-04 14:49:13] <derpandaz> *mmotion

[2023-01-04 14:49:38] <+outlaw_militia_gaming> Probably disrupts the code. Like when you pause sometimes and then see the game jitter a little when getting back into it. That might be what‚Äôs happening
[2023-01-04 14:50:07] <+Con_IV> It also might help with FPS
[2023-01-04 14:50:17] <+kasiya13> *nods* the map screwed with the physics of the fence breaking in that other skip from a few days back
[2023-01-04 14:51:20] <+ZombXGaming> what if you drive the car up the hill backwards? The front of the car would collide with your legs and fling ou up instead of flinging the car, possibly

[2023-01-04 14:51:54] <shadowk222> i think when the map slows down time and you have the same fps more physics calculations happen in a shorter time

[2023-01-04 14:56:22] <+ZombXGaming> Definitely the wheel that fl8ngs the player from what I've observed, cuz the car flings when you aren't in the wheel, and the player flings when in the wheel. It could just be a coincidence, but I personally think its unlikely and see a link
[2023-01-04 14:56:43] <shadowk222> it turned into giga rng from hell

[2023-01-04 15:47:37] <+lukaryne> @Maxylobes Sorry I was in a call and couldn'#t say sooner. One thing I'm noticing on this setup is the position of Amok's elbow. If the elbow comes out of the car, it's a failed launch, but if the elbow stays within the car's model, it's a successful launch.
[2023-01-04 15:47:43] <@%+MalachiteKell> well, when it gets consistent, someone's going to have to find another skip to work on

[2023-01-04 15:51:47] <+lukaryne> Maxy, keep an eye on Amok's elbow, if it clips outside the car when you're standing on it, it's a failed launch.

[2023-01-04 15:53:05] <CyanideCocoa> idk how true this is but I've heard the launch is mostly based on how deep into the back tire Amok is

[2023-01-04 16:05:36] <Maria_Bulgaria> do you think Amok is one of the games in the world?
[2023-01-04 16:05:48] <Lidawano> sub pls I is poor
[2023-01-04 16:05:56] <emmab_88> borderlands has had multiple ag/sgdq runs

[2023-01-04 16:06:04] <%MsRaynie> Yaaas and I had to come say thank you
[2023-01-04 16:06:07] <eyessownshutt> I want to see how this launch works
[2023-01-04 16:06:16] <Redchord17> hopefully that killer klowns game will be good, or at least fun to watch
[2023-01-04 16:06:18] <+grande0989> oh
[2023-01-04 16:06:38] <%+PhranklesTV> DBD has all the licenses tbh they really cant be competed with, its even worse the WOW in the MMO space
[2023-01-04 16:06:48] <DragonChronicler> honestly my opinion on Riot's stuff: TFT is ok. Don't touch League. Watch Arcane - even my parents could get into it how noob friendly it is
[2023-01-04 16:07:15] <+lukaryne> Texas Chainsaw Massacre might actually do good as it's coming to Game Pass day 1
[2023-01-04 16:07:15] <+PrimeDarkseid> TCM is gonna hype. F13 was a very fun game
[2023-01-04 16:07:17] <%+PhranklesTV> why no touch league game is fun if you can avoid toxicity
[2023-01-04 16:07:27] <D_Art_Drawing> What is in your opinion the best PvE COOP game?

[2023-01-04 16:14:46] <wittier_in_the_shower> considering how inconsistent this is, do you think you will bother to do runs before the deadline?
[2023-01-04 16:15:01] <eyessownshutt> It looks like aiming in between the break of the 2 fences is the spot
