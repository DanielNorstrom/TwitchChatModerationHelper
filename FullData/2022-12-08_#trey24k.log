[2022-12-08 17:22:00] <ogsoloalpaca> I have had trouble putting on weight. even when I was carbo loading
[2022-12-08 17:22:02] <%madmanritz95> a strong core feels good tho, helps with lifts

[2022-12-08 17:22:09] <+Alchin0> You need core muscles to be able to show them off regardless of being skinnny or not

[2022-12-08 17:22:19] <%+notcrissy> running to burn calories will make you want to eat more than just not eating the calories originally
[2022-12-08 17:22:28] <Syrnevar> Ab workout is more fore toning your muscles and getting rid of loose tissue on ur belly
[2022-12-08 17:22:40] <logicalconclusions> i figured logical would just ban this name as soon as he saw it
[2022-12-08 17:22:41] <+beardedvamp> but the ab belt thing you wear and it flexes your core passively and gives abs... remember that shit lol
[2022-12-08 17:22:49] <%Kaigey96> All of your movement comes from your core
[2022-12-08 17:22:50] <+Mr_Rad> that core strength be important
[2022-12-08 17:22:51] BAN: logicalconclusions, logicalconclusions
[2022-12-08 17:22:55] <orngoutlooker> dont train for abs tho train for core strength
[2022-12-08 17:22:59] <+Alchin0> You can gain bigger and more prominent abs by doing core work outs
[2022-12-08 17:22:59] <%+brickquicker> everything is core. literally

[2022-12-08 17:23:13] <+slavmafiaboris> abs and back are the most important muscle groups. everything else comes from the stability that those muscles bring
[2022-12-08 17:23:15] <%$WushuDeathKICK> compound lifts are superior
[2022-12-08 17:23:16] <%madmanritz95> all lifts use core its soo important, helps prevent injury as well

[2022-12-08 17:54:05] <%Scannerrrr> I mena with the time i spend on gaming id spend the 1k eventually. but would have to test out other ones first. the nice part is that theyre molded to your ear
[2022-12-08 17:54:06] <%cravenLX> its all a balance
[2022-12-08 17:54:10] <%+lt_carl_winslow> @lt_carl_winslow That's facts. The next step up would probably be some of the beyerdynamic dt's. I have a pair of Yamaha HS 8's so I don't wear headphones that long.

[2022-12-08 17:54:32] <Echoback> I mean some people just have nearly no expenses besides food and rent/mortgage/whatever because theyre focusing on getting the tarkov bag
[2022-12-08 17:54:35] <%tacoboutit_> trey would be right i am a broke bitch
[2022-12-08 17:54:41] <l0rd_havok> I make well over 500k a year and think its a waste to spend 1k on headphones. If you make 500k and spend 1k on headphones youre probably in debt up to your eyeballs because you make obviously poor financial choices
[2022-12-08 17:54:41] <+onepunchmango_> getting an expensive car is only fun if you can pay it off immediately

Car, house, subscriptions, better lifestyle, more luxury's? It goes fast tbh. Most people don't stay at the 40k a year living parameters when  they increase thier income.

[2022-12-08 20:10:04] <prokisprok> i disagree i think that 99% more damage was the most realistic part of this game your not going to walk away if someone shoots u in the leg and   or run like its more realistic when u die fast your not taking 10 bullets in real life ur dead lol
[2022-12-08 20:10:05] <%gkplaysgames_> make it as rare as 7N40
[2022-12-08 20:10:10] <%$pkraider23> m80 will still zero level 5 in like 5 shots
[2022-12-08 20:10:16] <%+PsycoPrankster> BSG should buff shittier ammo or reduce price of it so its more feasible to run
[2022-12-08 20:10:19] <NZmiddamoore> i like the idea of ammo still shreading class 5 and lower

[2022-12-08 20:11:02] <%+shakyxe> More realistic doesn’t equate to fun. No one would play if 2 shots of 9mm killed you

[2022-12-08 20:12:17] <NZmiddamoore> i do like what youre saying, using more variety of tarkovs guns would be good to see
[2022-12-08 20:12:18] <@%^derks> i think they should add another 9x18 round
[2022-12-08 20:12:18] <%jakecud> They add guns to distract from lack of actual patches that would fix game breaking bugs.

[2022-12-08 20:13:26] <+smurrGG> buff all best ammo types to the same as m62. make all lvl 6s gear fir only make all good ammo types quest locked like bp and you will see a lot more calibers of weapons and a lot more low level gear
[2022-12-08 20:13:28] <NZmiddamoore> id run the MCX over most if it was cheaper, love that gun IRL
[2022-12-08 20:13:33] <%+Nyanzito> 9mm in this game is a bad joke

[2022-12-08 20:13:44] <@%stopdodgin> It makes sense.
[2022-12-08 20:13:46] <%+AresGamingFPS> should be max 80 or even 50
[2022-12-08 20:13:58] <@%stopdodgin> I said it
[2022-12-08 20:14:02] <NZmiddamoore> it shouldnt be one tap tho its subsonic

[2022-12-08 20:15:36] <SummaryAlarm> i like your point though
[2022-12-08 20:15:38] <NZmiddamoore> if the game felt like the first 2 weeks for over 2 months and it took trey 4 months to get cappa, itd be fun

[2022-12-08 20:16:40] <%+Nyanzito> they could still be good, but needed to be rare as f* and the whos have it should be a god at the game
[2022-12-08 20:16:52] <@%stopdodgin> If you want to make the game more realistic, buy a 4080
[2022-12-08 20:16:57] <NotAMeme_ZA> it was a missclick
[2022-12-08 20:16:59] <TheDeadMoose154> if we are talking about realism, you cant just eat a landmine and walk it off with some morphine

[2022-12-08 20:18:13] <+fable_october> tarkov just needs to make the whole entire wipe feel like it does the first 4 weeks that would feel more balanced

[2022-12-08 20:27:44] <+fable_october> tarkov should reduce recoil and increase bullet bloom by a percentage of distance

[2022-12-08 20:29:01] <%+ttubbs2> Doesn’t that just lower your player base by neglecting them by saying he won’t balance now?
[2022-12-08 20:29:04] <+CafePatron> When EFT is done and balanced we will be warping around the universe in Star Citizen 1.0 also
[2022-12-08 20:29:06] <Roloisanewb> nikita wants the game to die though lmao feels like he wants a smaller base
