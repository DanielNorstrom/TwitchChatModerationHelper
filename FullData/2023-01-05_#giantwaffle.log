[2023-01-05 15:58:32] <%Pbjtime54> so kinda like the snapchat glasses?
[2023-01-05 15:58:33] <Bulltank> @BobTaco21 yes

[2023-01-05 15:58:53] <Svenhof> LinkedIn has become a cesspit of web3 and metaverse bullshit influencers. That hype is going to die real quick. Just my opinion

[2023-01-05 15:58:56] <@%$Apparentthreat> quest 2 has it as well, but it's grayscale and not very great

[2023-01-05 16:18:01] <+tcRunaway> Die size is important because nvidia pays per wafer. And smaller die means they get more chips on every wafer meaning the price for the chip is less

[2023-01-05 16:18:38] <ValueTown> nvidia is pricing these so high because they over made the 3000 series and didn't sell them all

[2023-01-05 16:21:12] <+WDForty> i think someone said it comes down to their vapor chamber?
[2023-01-05 16:21:13] <+UnholyLP> atleast intel is trying to get into gpus, so more competition
[2023-01-05 16:21:16] <ValueTown> debaur figured it out. the cooler's vapor chamber is broken. it most likely doesn't have enough coolant inside
[2023-01-05 16:21:17] <arkun_> It’s a flaw in the reference design for the cooler causing the thermal issues

[2023-01-05 17:33:17] <%+deandosss> As an IT guy.... if your computer BSOD... you got a issue with it....
[2023-01-05 17:33:18] <+Nostromo6467> and then you bluescreen, lol
[2023-01-05 17:33:20] <thetexasewok09> im in IT and i get bsod issues and they are all user error
[2023-01-05 17:33:20] <lilgangstagoth1> i havent seen a blue screen in so long
[2023-01-05 17:33:21] <jinkleft> bad drivers/hardware have been my causes
[2023-01-05 17:33:22] <+daza009> human error
[2023-01-05 17:33:23] <+WDForty> my bsod are usually from old hardware reaching end of life, or bad drivers
[2023-01-05 17:33:26] <natsu130> you will get blue screen when you wrong unplug USB @Giantwaffle OMEGALUL
[2023-01-05 17:33:26] <%CanadianHealthCare> I had some bad memory that would fail sometimes
[2023-01-05 17:33:33] <AleXanDreMau> @Giantwaffle maybe diferent updates!
[2023-01-05 17:33:36] <%+punkgeek> Lots of blue screens are from too aggressive overclocking or user error, but not all. Corrupt drivers, failing RAM, etc
[2023-01-05 17:33:36] <@%$SailorWS> I dont get blue screens but my PC will just shut down
[2023-01-05 17:33:37] <+jmm548> only blue screen i ever got was due to power outage or over heating cpu cause the cooler got jostled
[2023-01-05 17:33:40] <%+LokiRulez> i had 1 BSOD in the years ive been gaming, and that was becuase my RAM was being stupid and needed to be replaced
[2023-01-05 17:33:41] <BlueVariant> I've only ever blue screened from random websites misbehaving, like twitter, twitch, or youtube.
[2023-01-05 17:33:42] <+Thr0h> using CPUs from 2014 Kappa
[2023-01-05 17:33:46] <Tom7258> yes
[2023-01-05 17:33:46] <+GableGrip> Many are caused by bad drivers
[2023-01-05 17:33:49] <+MrWizard1974> I haven't blue screened since the athalon days
[2023-01-05 17:33:51] <%0sem0> makes sense
[2023-01-05 17:33:51] <Al_Kappaccino> i only blue screened from overclocking i think yeah
[2023-01-05 17:33:53] <Jaroait> Shouldn't it be yellow since it shows you what room you are going into, not what room you are in?
[2023-01-05 17:33:55] <+TomSeether> I remember when Apex just released, the anti-cheat gave me a blue screen once
[2023-01-05 17:33:58] <+BobTaco21> The only time I have blue screened was a cheap laptop I was messing with core windows files on

[2023-01-05 17:34:02] <+Sentinel1_9> @Giantwaffle whats the fors and against for upgrading to win11?
[2023-01-05 17:34:03] <+Supremagorious> Old blue screens were usually memory allocation errors where multiple things would claim the same memory block at the same time and fight
[2023-01-05 17:34:11] <JasonDM_> I was having a bad time with firefox freezing up randomly at times, tested my ram rigorously and found out my mobo or CPU is messed up

[2023-01-05 17:35:49] <kane1941> wouldnt each floor different color better?
[2023-01-05 17:35:51] <gtluszcz> Why not have a different  color for every room?
[2023-01-05 17:36:02] <natsu130> you can do one elevator block that will be express from totaly bottom floor to top floor
[2023-01-05 17:36:03] <+RockyMountainHiThere> is that a Ci creation in the other room?
[2023-01-05 17:36:03] <%+brenner1265> Why not colored floors? Like surrounding the center elevators with the color
[2023-01-05 17:36:39] <%0sem0> do 2 by 2 elevators.. It makes it way easier.

[2023-01-05 17:45:46] <%Immp> Is there a reason you put a drawer controller per line, rather than link the drawers with trim?
[2023-01-05 17:45:49] <thomasausen> can you set the me terminals number of items again
[2023-01-05 17:46:17] <+loaded57> you can use oak trim to connect each line of drawers
[2023-01-05 17:46:24] <DarkbuilderX> Trim acts like a drawer for connecting around corners and stuff
[2023-01-05 17:46:26] <lilgangstagoth1> u can use trim to link drawers together but dont think that will help with what ur doing
[2023-01-05 17:46:26] <+loaded57> 1 drawer control can go 12 in every direction

[2023-01-05 17:46:54] <%Immp> So a drawer controller on reads 12 blocks away, but it you link rows of drawers with Drawer Trim, you can link them together. But yes, unless you hide them , they are ugly
[2023-01-05 17:46:55] <+jmm548> i like the dark oak
[2023-01-05 17:47:00] <+korderoi> are they backwards? since you're going to come in the room from the other way

[2023-01-05 18:05:31] <InternetPlumber> on demand is too slow and crafting cards are too server intensive at massive scale

[2023-01-05 18:06:05] <Pvtsjoerd> @PureSpider I mean I get that you want to passively craft most things but nothing
[2023-01-05 18:06:14] <%+lvyEartman> how are you going to do this if a craft has multiple outputs?

[2023-01-05 18:13:20] <bandani> @PureSpider what the truck you mean?
[2023-01-05 18:13:26] <%TheWonderLlama> I think Truck-kun should be isekai'd and we get an anime of a truck going around running over monsters and bandits...
[2023-01-05 18:13:31] <PureSpider> and you not once stop to think "hold up, this shit kinda weird"?! not once?
[2023-01-05 18:13:36] <@%$SailorWS> PureSpider isekais have a tendency to kill their MC's with trucks at the start
[2023-01-05 18:13:37] <%+IronGajeel> chat someone saw My Life as Inukai-san’s Dog yesterday? KEKW
[2023-01-05 18:13:37] <+All_Tech> or it shows the person hit having this crazy adventure while the driver's life spirals down hill

[2023-01-05 18:13:44] <PureSpider> SailorWS bless you
[2023-01-05 18:13:56] <%TheWonderLlama> and those monsters and bandits are isekai'd back to earth... booom
[2023-01-05 18:13:56] <%Allmostdone> But that would make the truck a hero. He isn’t a hero

[2023-01-05 19:05:57] <$Saytos1> 90 hz ok
[2023-01-05 19:06:02] <%$Tro95> Battery extension packs make you look like a french tank

[2023-01-05 19:06:06] <SmartDoll> index can do 144 if you really want
[2023-01-05 19:06:13] <@%$Apparentthreat> CiVR just get that thing on the back to counterbalance
[2023-01-05 19:06:18] <%Littleme02> it depends on how close you can get the lences to your eyes

[2023-01-05 19:07:19] <@%+Nexhunter> @ImEightBall yes
[2023-01-05 19:07:20] <AIex_0> nothing about this would really make me want to pick it over the quest
[2023-01-05 19:07:25] <@%+Nexhunter> which is why it gonna be intereference up the asshole
[2023-01-05 19:07:30] <+mkam225> They can do a few fingers with those
[2023-01-05 19:07:31] <Pticrix> Oh wait that's going to stream from our routers? Man, most people have shitty networks because people aren't network engineers.
[2023-01-05 19:07:34] <+stickman_02> My index will randomly go grey screen after like an hour of using it anyone know what be happening I’ve tried solutions online and haven’t had good results yet
[2023-01-05 19:07:44] <%+Askjong> Isn't this the step up from quest?
[2023-01-05 19:07:56] <@%+Nexhunter> @stickman_02 contact valve support
[2023-01-05 19:07:59] <Casual_Steve_> does it have Foveated rendering or eye tracking
[2023-01-05 19:08:01] <SmartDoll> @stickman_02 should talk to valve support
[2023-01-05 19:08:02] <@%+Nexhunter> it the same hardware
[2023-01-05 19:08:02] <DarkbuilderX> These don't have a visible strap, so index/thumb only?
[2023-01-05 19:08:03] <iloveplants> what if im missing fingers tho
[2023-01-05 19:08:10] <@%+Nexhunter> just better screens
[2023-01-05 19:08:14] <%+Askjong> less then the quest pro tho
[2023-01-05 19:08:17] <+Alamose> I hate the index controllers, but I play pretty much only beatsaber so I use my vive controllers
[2023-01-05 19:08:17] <+stickman_02> Ight I reach out to them thanks guys
[2023-01-05 19:08:31] <%dreamylunar> this is gonna be like that for a while
[2023-01-05 19:08:36] <%OrangeW2> 90Hz is a huge dealbreaker for me
[2023-01-05 19:08:39] <%dreamylunar> alot of ppl are gonna buy a new headset

[2023-01-05 19:08:52] <+YoFunkey> @giantwaffle can u compare the index side by side now?
[2023-01-05 19:08:54] <+baconburgerfries> bingPog
[2023-01-05 19:08:54] <%dreamylunar> but will still use the index controller
[2023-01-05 19:08:54] <Harmar> to me only thing that that is a plus seams to be how the lenses work other than that seams like a index
[2023-01-05 19:09:06] VIEWERS: 2 981
[2023-01-05 19:09:06] <SmartDoll> @Shounanek that's the max, min is 1.5m by 1.5m
[2023-01-05 19:09:14] <@%+Nexhunter> @Giantwaffle per HTC they have a spare battery in the main headset so you can hotswap the main battery that is on the back of the strap
[2023-01-05 19:09:29] <Spirevipp> wasnt it inside out tracking?
[2023-01-05 19:09:31] <+michaelmichaelTV> Curious if passthrough is good enough to make VRDJ much easier
[2023-01-05 19:09:33] <poop_nukem> Even the quest 2 can do 120hz OC on the screen and it has wireless at 400$ moon2PAIN
[2023-01-05 19:09:53] <farcryer2> "+Add to comparison" big button on the screen Kappa
[2023-01-05 19:10:12] <%cmmeth> have you seen the pico 4? what do you think about it?

[2023-01-05 19:10:37] <%DustyPC_> What browser are you using?
[2023-01-05 19:10:46] <%+Askjong> But you can't hit 120 on standalone headset

[2023-01-05 19:13:23] <%+Askjong> So you can break it and buy another one
[2023-01-05 19:13:24] <+Zett121> pully system
[2023-01-05 19:13:25] <%MasterKraft> so they can sell the 90 degree addon for 50 bucks
[2023-01-05 19:13:28] <%+MetalBBA> because fuck your cable integrity
[2023-01-05 19:13:28] <@%+Nexhunter> @Giantwaffle so the internal battery will only last 10 minutes on a full charge when hot swapping
[2023-01-05 19:13:32] <%Littleme02> what happends when you look up waffle?
[2023-01-05 19:13:33] <%DrHax_> I bet its on purpose peepoSip

[2023-01-05 19:13:37] <BBQgril> just put the battery in  upside down @Giantwaffle
[2023-01-05 19:13:44] <Cephalospor1n> you could use a magnetic right angle to route it facing back
[2023-01-05 19:13:44] <+Bizmarty> it would interfere with your beak!
[2023-01-05 19:13:45] <Saishu_> i use the oculus link attached to a spring hanging from the ceiling
[2023-01-05 19:13:49] <@%$Apparentthreat> what was that other nose looking thing?
[2023-01-05 19:13:50] <%$YOUCEP> it would pinch your neck maybe

[2023-01-05 19:13:51] <%+Psyclone____> i wonder if it has issues with the cable falling off
[2023-01-05 19:13:53] <%mechoriet> no shot the battery pack is only for 2 hours
[2023-01-05 19:13:57] <%TheIrishGuy> 80 euro more
[2023-01-05 19:13:59] <+Marguti> the one with the cable plug downwards is 50 bucks more expensive
[2023-01-05 19:14:02] <%LinearLayer> 80 for a cable....
[2023-01-05 19:14:03] <@%+Nexhunter> Q1 2023 HTC says @Giantwaffle

[2023-01-05 19:15:12] <HostileLogOut> it's a pretty bad headset. low resolution no mention of PPI? etc

[2023-01-05 19:15:32] <@%+Nexhunter> OMEGALUL
[2023-01-05 19:15:32] <%+bcdmonkey> but do you want only 2 hours of wireless
[2023-01-05 19:15:34] <+em_t_hed> 180 dollar cable  LUL     makes the quest cable look cheap AF
[2023-01-05 19:15:44] <@%+Nexhunter> it HTC
[2023-01-05 19:15:48] <DespiseTheirLies> every 2 hours ... "battery low" pepeLaugh
[2023-01-05 19:15:49] <Casual_Steve_> up to 2 hours

[2023-01-05 19:15:56] <+navbryn> trying to convince him self to buy something he already wants
[2023-01-05 19:15:57] <@%$Apparentthreat> what's the wrist tracker doing?

[2023-01-05 19:16:03] <@%$Apparentthreat> besides the obvious
[2023-01-05 19:16:04] <HostileLogOut> i wonder how the PPI is on it. cause its only 1920x1920 per eye lol
[2023-01-05 19:16:15] <%+Kyogerfan> what if you just turn the back upside down
[2023-01-05 19:16:18] <DarkbuilderX> I don't see why not, just get one of those mini backpacks
[2023-01-05 19:16:20] <$1soton1c> see ? wworks
[2023-01-05 19:16:21] <BBQgril> can you plug in the battry "upside" down
[2023-01-05 19:16:34] <+Obliviron> lmao "strapped bomb" is literally making a suicide vest of batteries OMEGALUL
[2023-01-05 19:16:34] <Andy_975> peepee?
[2023-01-05 19:16:40] <HostileLogOut> if the PPI or PPD is not higher then the quest 2 or index. then eh. not worth it
[2023-01-05 19:16:41] <Cephalospor1n> PPD is pupilary Distance
[2023-01-05 19:16:42] <%satyasann> pp big = better
[2023-01-05 19:16:42] <InternetPlumber> PeterPanDam?
[2023-01-05 19:16:44] <@%+Nexhunter> as long as the power connector connecting the battery and the headset isn't some proprietary trash they should be able to create pass throughs
[2023-01-05 19:16:44] <+em_t_hed> math it
[2023-01-05 19:16:52] <PureSpider> big PP YEP
[2023-01-05 19:16:59] <%+Askjong> compare it to the Pico 4

[2023-01-05 19:17:57] <+Lemures322> JUST tuned in; Been considering a better VR headset (looking for wireless) than my Pimax 5k.  How does this new thing look?
[2023-01-05 19:17:58] <KrunkleDunk> you can buy it for me and I'll test it for you
[2023-01-05 19:18:07] <$Asneakyninja1> they are def trying to take on the quest pro with this it seems
[2023-01-05 19:18:07] <%GFQPR1882> Waffle do u know if the psvr2 is any gd compared with them ?

[2023-01-05 19:18:19] <%+Askjong> The Pico 4 is so much cheaper and have good specs
[2023-01-05 19:18:22] <rauko_64> that hand control stuff is old tech tho
[2023-01-05 19:18:27] <HostileLogOut> @Lemures322 dont buy pimax. they got god awful support and has a ton of issues.
[2023-01-05 19:18:28] <%GFQPR1882> I’ve ordered it but don’t know KEKW
[2023-01-05 19:18:30] <DespiseTheirLies> I still use my og vive lol
[2023-01-05 19:18:37] <+haydcarney> It has hand tracking but not sure good it will be
[2023-01-05 19:18:37] <+Mick_> it does not look that much better than the current offerings out there

[2023-01-05 19:18:44] <HostileLogOut> going from 144 > 90 hz is rough AF @Giantwaffle it looks slow and blurry

[2023-01-05 19:18:46] <%+Vargh> LUL
[2023-01-05 19:18:51] <$Asneakyninja1> @Askjong but you can't really get outside of Asia unless you go through some roundabout ways right? or did that change finally?
[2023-01-05 19:18:58] <%+brenner1265> @Giantwaffle what price do you think they should be asking?
[2023-01-05 19:19:03] <Vaarel> yea I've pretty consistently heard for VR 120hz or better is the only way
[2023-01-05 19:19:04] <%+Askjong> @Asneakyninja1 I can get in in EU

[2023-01-05 19:19:27] <GuardMoony> depends if the battery is included
[2023-01-05 19:19:30] <+Lemures322> @HostileLogOut Ya, I bought the Pimax 5k through kickstarter YEARS ago.  It sucks, support sucks, etc, I want something better for PC gaming, preferably wireless, but I dont' know what to get.
[2023-01-05 19:19:31] <HostileLogOut> the Index is worth more in my opinion. a full set is what 1079$ or so right
[2023-01-05 19:19:49] <HostileLogOut> and 2 stations
[2023-01-05 19:20:00] <PureSpider> but the quest 2 has hand tracking
[2023-01-05 19:20:07] <AIex_0> might aswell get a quest and use your controllers
[2023-01-05 19:20:09] <HostileLogOut> @Lemures322 ehm then you have to go quest 2. or wait for valve to get something wireless
[2023-01-05 19:20:10] <%+Askjong> Finger tracking with cameras?

[2023-01-05 19:20:15] <%CanadianHealthCare> can you compare the Vive with the Quest Pro
[2023-01-05 19:20:22] <$Asneakyninja1> @Giantwaffle having used nothing but Airlink with my Quest 2 for wireless PC VR i can say that its worth it to get a device more dedicated to wireless vr. i have to have a battery on the back of my head to be able to play for more than an hour and a half
[2023-01-05 19:20:27] <+Math354e> Are they not trying to compete with the quest pro?
[2023-01-05 19:20:35] <+Lemures322> I already have stations and index controllers; I'm strongly considering the Vive Pro 2 w/ wireless adapter.  I was hoping Vive would announce something new in that realm but apparently not.
[2023-01-05 19:21:04] <%OrangeW2> so $1100 + $400 in batteries KEKW

[2023-01-05 19:21:09] <+Obliviron> is the VR experience worth it if you dont like vrchat? @Giantwaffle
[2023-01-05 19:21:09] <+em_t_hed> gotta love proprietary
[2023-01-05 19:21:11] <%OrangeW2> this looks like a terrible offer, actually
[2023-01-05 19:21:12] <PureSpider> using an external battery on the quest 2 funnily makes it more comfortable, because then you have similar weights on the front and back of your head :D
[2023-01-05 19:21:16] <@%+Nexhunter> @Giantwaffle they have a sunglasses mode
[2023-01-05 19:21:24] <@%+Nexhunter> so you can bypass the battery
[2023-01-05 19:21:25] <HostileLogOut> pretty sure they are targetting Businesses with this headset
[2023-01-05 19:21:26] <GuardMoony> I got the rift S on 80hz. And it ain't too bad with the refresh
[2023-01-05 19:21:27] <%CanadianHealthCare> I think the XR is competing with the Quest Pro
[2023-01-05 19:21:29] <%+Askjong> But with the quest you do never get high FPS, you get around 30-60 fps. Only small games you can get 120
[2023-01-05 19:21:47] <HeyAFrozenZebra> Is there information on the optics?
[2023-01-05 19:21:48] <%+Askjong> PC VR
[2023-01-05 19:21:48] <RedDirtSK> how about the pico 4?
[2023-01-05 19:22:00] <PureSpider> Askjong sounds like you got a shitty cable danHmm
[2023-01-05 19:22:02] <HeyAFrozenZebra> Oh I meant the lenses
[2023-01-05 19:22:21] <HostileLogOut> @Askjong do you have the official oculus cable? or some 3rd party one
[2023-01-05 19:22:21] <%+Askjong> @PureSpider i get 3.6 GBs
[2023-01-05 19:22:32] <$Asneakyninja1> the cable is more stable, but that said airlink has gotten pretty damn good. only downside is the SLIGHT latency i have which is more notable when im hanging with people in VRC krisuSmile
[2023-01-05 19:22:42] <@%+Nexhunter> @Giantwaffle "USB-C connecting port on the right-hand side allows users to plug into a power source for 30-watt fast charging"
[2023-01-05 19:22:47] <Saishu_> i use the oculus link cable and battery never runs out
[2023-01-05 19:22:53] <+Lemures322> So what's the go-to wireless VR gaming from your PC headset right now then?  Or is the whole problem that there isn't one without significant issues?
[2023-01-05 19:23:03] <%+Askjong> @HostileLogOut 3rd party. But i get highter FPS then all my other friends using quest 2
[2023-01-05 19:23:04] <+haydcarney> What do you think about the Pico? @giantwaffle
[2023-01-05 19:23:06] <HostileLogOut> @Lemures322 Quest 2. sadly
[2023-01-05 19:23:07] <PureSpider> Askjong should be 5GBB/s++

[2023-01-05 19:23:16] <%OrangeW2> Pico is owned by Bytedance who owns TikTok so that's an immediate no
[2023-01-05 19:23:28] <$Asneakyninja1> the HTC is going to be more for those who have wanted wireless vr that don't want to deal with facebook/meta
[2023-01-05 19:23:32] <HostileLogOut> @Askjong you possibly just got a better pc then them. but thats also the issue 3rd party cables are not guranteed to work.
[2023-01-05 19:23:32] <+Mick_> it is a good entry device if you are curious on VR
[2023-01-05 19:23:34] <+Lemures322> Quest 2?  I have the original Vive, and a Pimax 5k... seems like a downgrade, even if it adds wireless :(
[2023-01-05 19:23:35] <Sander20011> Minecraft?

[2023-01-05 19:23:50] <HostileLogOut> @Lemures322 side upgrade.
[2023-01-05 19:23:50] <+em_t_hed> but the main processor isnt an actual upgrade?
[2023-01-05 19:23:53] <PureSpider> Askjong which means, at least USB 3.2 Gen 1
[2023-01-05 19:23:55] <+Fhuey> $1100 to be surrounded by traps... nty

[2023-01-05 19:25:18] <%+suicidebolt> You can do an access point that will do it no need to get a router just plug the router into the access point
[2023-01-05 19:25:19] <sogerr> you can build your own router, its not hard

[2023-01-05 19:25:21] <+Lemures322> I guess I could get the Quest 2 for wireless games like beat saber and stuff, but if I want higher quality gaming I'll just have to accept no wireless, and stick with my Pimax 5k for now. *sigh*

[2023-01-05 19:25:28] <PureSpider> Askjong if you want those sweet fps, yea :D those cables are somtimes marketed as quest 2 cables, but just make sure it's USB 3.2 gen 1 or newer

[2023-01-05 19:27:31] <%Littleme02> i'm thinking there is going to be index price drop first
[2023-01-05 19:27:37] <+TheShaddo13> and he needs rubber coated aluminium cables
[2023-01-05 19:27:39] <HostileLogOut> @MonkeyOnDonkey yes. index is vastly superior.

[2023-01-05 19:36:36] <BBQgril> can you turn the battery upside down?
[2023-01-05 19:36:36] <Exo0De> @Giantwaffle i think its suppose to go with pulley system
[2023-01-05 19:36:37] <+jdog0616> apple said officaially the charger is on the bottom to prevent wired mouse use
[2023-01-05 19:36:37] <+Koeckie> no they did not it's just bc it's $$$$$
[2023-01-05 19:36:38] <+MaroLupus> big brain moment
[2023-01-05 19:36:39] <iloveplants> clearly they designed it upside down

[2023-01-05 19:36:50] <MonkeyOnDonkey> @HostileLogOut yes thats true. You need one for both. Quest 2 can already do wifi...
[2023-01-05 19:36:51] <$Asneakyninja1> there has to be a weird reason for it
[2023-01-05 19:36:54] <@%+Nexhunter> @Giantwaffle it is USB-C
[2023-01-05 19:36:54] <%Dagmoo> yeah ceiling hook?
[2023-01-05 19:36:56] <%Sir_Leinad_> Some people install pullys on their ceiling for VR cables but it seems way too big of a niche for them to do that
[2023-01-05 19:36:57] <+All_Tech> same people that put headphone jacks at bottoms of phones
[2023-01-05 19:36:57] <+NephilimXS> probably thinking people will use some type of pully system

[2023-01-05 19:37:01] <+jdog0616> they have an official statement why
[2023-01-05 19:37:03] <%Littleme02> You can't have it on the bottom since its gunna hit your back when you look directly up
[2023-01-05 19:37:05] <The_Holas> its for cealing hooks Kappa
[2023-01-05 19:37:06] <InternetPlumber> ov everyone has an overhead cable management gantry
[2023-01-05 19:37:06] <$Mongo_Smash> I'd prefer to have it straight out the back.

[2023-01-05 19:37:10] <%lazyhot> Rather an engineer and product owner argued for months, the PO won :p

[2023-01-05 19:37:22] <%iamforever27> Did they think it would easily fall out if on the bottom vs top?
[2023-01-05 19:37:26] <%Stragmol> sounds like a designer assertion more than an engineer... "it doesn't look good with the cord at the top or back, put it under"

[2023-01-05 19:38:45] <commander_scheppert> @hostilelogout They did, until now. VR support from them is kinda half-assed, i hoped they would do a bit more, since we barely got some good games since Alyx and other companies mostly put out mobile looking shit.

[2023-01-05 21:07:53] <Kerold> The FTB Client are available on Mac, at least
[2023-01-05 21:07:54] <+Sentinel1_9> you can

[2023-01-05 21:07:59] <%+Schutter07> should work fine, did it like 10 years ago
[2023-01-05 21:07:59] <IHaveShirts> Minecraft: Java Edition versions later than 1.18 are no longer supported on Mac OS below version 10.14. 5. We updated our codebase for Caves & Cliffs Part II to Java 17, which had an inadvertent effect on users playing on MacOS versions below 10.14.
[2023-01-05 21:08:01] <+Kaiuwe31> yes it is, im on the m1 pro and its easy playable
[2023-01-05 21:08:02] <%+Vizion_TV> Does anyone use Mac for anything other than video editing and music? LUL

[2023-01-05 21:08:34] <%lazyhot> Java's main slogan is write it once deploy/run everywhere
[2023-01-05 21:08:35] <thepolaroidbear> Yeah I've been liking it over multi-mc. Very similar though.

[2023-01-05 21:34:11] <BakaPixel> @Giantwaffle You can also put them into a slave and have a connected drawer for the desire item and one voiding for the nondesired.

[2023-01-05 21:34:47] <lilgangstagoth1> can use a trash can if need be for less important or thing ualready produce
[2023-01-05 21:34:48] <zzzDai> Output it into multiple drawers and void the byproduct drawers
[2023-01-05 21:34:50] <raironzera> items byproducts into other drawer with void upgrade
[2023-01-05 21:35:45] <%+inforv> and runs well
[2023-01-05 21:35:48] <%Hurtwolf> I like the resource websites they make for games like PoE
[2023-01-05 21:35:52] <%+Purecrew> Thats why you would need a seperate Drawer system for biproducts. If you void the 2x2 it will void the primary product as well and never stop making it.

But then they drive a good number of turbo users into subbing to several streamers instead of paying less than the cost of two subs to have absolutely no ads.

[2023-01-05 22:49:56] <Smileynator> Cache is FASTER data access than RAM, so when the CPU needs data from RAM, it catches as much as it can at once, into L3/L2/L1 cache, so it can then access the next bytes so much faster (iterating lists and arrays go brrr)

[2023-01-05 23:00:43] <ryan_wellence> well, when we define colors via hue, saturation, and brightness, we say brown, but that is specified by a hue we would refer to as organge, and darken it and desaturate it as well. When someone says, "it isn't real" we mean we wouldn't define it as a hue.

[2023-01-05 23:02:50] <%omar21cu> @lgamer7 not all of them, they all produced from mixing blue red green. The one color which is fake is brown, because its just a dark orange. Check out this video:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh4aWZRtTwU
[2023-01-05 23:02:56] <pinhead_larynx> what happens when you have 1000 energetic bars but no vibrant?

[2023-01-05 23:03:17] <+W84M3> you could limit it with the 1 stack on the drawer
