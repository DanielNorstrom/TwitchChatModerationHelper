[2022-12-08 14:06:32] <%+Lurkio79> that was over way too quick
[2022-12-08 14:07:49] <%$tidolar> yes, but most of the time you're playing it against a board clear, buff, or some combo shit @bizjeet5 . you'd need a super buff heavy meta for it to actually be worth using, and you'd still need to tailor the deck around it
[2022-12-08 14:08:16] <+Spooky_The_Ooze> @Lurkio79 Do not FeelsBadMan because it's over, FeelsStrongMan because it happened.

[2022-12-08 14:33:14] <%FawKa> He makes his own @SoEmpty322 been like that since forever. It's part of the stream that Zeta makes up something nobody else sees (like armor priest pre expansion)
[2022-12-08 14:33:18] <SoEmpty322> I think darkbishop is a cut , if you are using hero power it means ur losing anyway and its a bad draw

[2022-12-08 14:48:41] <imawisdom> @zetalot are you unconfident in your deck or just playing hearthstone as ben bride intended?
[2022-12-08 14:48:48] <SoEmpty322> also most decks gonna win out of hand I think

[2022-12-08 14:50:29] <Totallynotillu> armour priest was grand design, pure art
[2022-12-08 14:50:33] <Aszendenz> I think priest has never been in such a bad spot. New cards are just too weak compared to others
[2022-12-08 14:50:46] <SoEmpty322> priest has been in worse spots
[2022-12-08 14:51:06] <Aszendenz> Yes thats what i meant:(
[2022-12-08 14:51:07] <SoEmpty322> also priest still has strong decks as a class
[2022-12-08 14:51:09] <%LobotomizzamiTutto> We are not running the only broken card that priest has at moment

[2022-12-08 14:51:43] <Totallynotillu> all good priest decks are aggro, which is not priest-like
[2022-12-08 14:51:49] <SoEmpty322> its just generate 2 good cards for 3
[2022-12-08 14:51:58] <SoEmpty322> good (if lucky)

[2022-12-08 14:54:41] <SoEmpty322> he has otk with bonelord
[2022-12-08 14:54:46] <SoEmpty322> like 80 dmg or smth
[2022-12-08 14:54:47] <%LobotomizzamiTutto> !wincon
[2022-12-08 14:54:48] <^StreamElements> And if you're looking for a "win condition" by looking for cards that say "Win the game.", I think that's setting yourself up for disappointment. Rather, there's several ways that Priest can win games; high value control, healing synergies, big minions, Rally stuff, etc.

[2022-12-08 16:45:40] <SoEmpty322> obviously boards with secrets were best
[2022-12-08 16:45:52] <%$tidolar> ya this one has none except breaking ice top right and summoning frostmourne

[2022-12-08 16:57:07] <%$tidolar> @Zypsit blood DK is a pure control deck, and combo gets stronger as the game goes on because you have more time to get your combo pieces
[2022-12-08 16:57:10] <aendlessssssly> @tidolar well unless they nerf all the druid crap, balance the hunter a little bit and people get bored of concoctions of rogues, it wont even be B tier KEKW
