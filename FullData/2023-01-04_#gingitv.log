[2023-01-04 00:21:42] <Storpande> @akashaEdge being invited to a 15 is impossible with 1270 rio
[2023-01-04 00:21:42] <mastashiffu> good luck next week as a caster
[2023-01-04 00:21:42] <Storpande> yes
[2023-01-04 00:21:52] <+staralfur12> what rio is recommended for 15?
[2023-01-04 00:21:55] <Exodir0502> of course because the competition is so big, there is easily one with a higher gearscore/io then you
[2023-01-04 00:21:55] <+akashaEdge> @Storpande i never said i was 1270
[2023-01-04 00:21:58] <Zroow> so next week is gonna be awful dungeons with overtuned bosses ?

[2023-01-04 16:50:32] <whoisape> as someone who competes on such a high level and being a WF raider, do you still enjoy the story elements of the game, the new zones, cinematics, etc? This was probably asked a million times before but im curious

[2023-01-04 16:51:05] <BellMaiQT> quick question, for outlaw is it better to have 2 1-handers or 1 1-hander and a dagger?
[2023-01-04 16:51:07] <fishtower404> is ded

[2023-01-04 16:51:37] <thv_> So I’ve been trying to figure out why I drop frames super hard in raid. I drop to like 15fps on Raz, does anyone have suggestions because I have a pretty good pc. I downloaded Elvui a while back and am now having issues. Does anyone think uninstalling it would fix it

[2023-01-04 18:30:21] <%JuckFrump> I think it's kinda ridicolous as well that people that got tier equipped can need on tier pieces anyway, that suck so many ninjas,
[2023-01-04 18:30:29] <Almostskilled> Got 3/4 of my tiers from vault, we have not had a single mage/druid/hunter token from the spider, 3 weeks in a row, on normal or HC, hell, even our mythic kill, 0 tokens for those classes, we still have a main mage without his 4set

[2023-01-04 20:26:26] <Pawco12> yes mage is not very skilled instead of blinking backwards he turned and was running out of circle, but still frost is underperforming on aoe only solid dungeon cause almost all bosses has 2 target or hight mobility one is Nok, for other dungeons frost is crap, with that argument that you can manage to rest orb on sible pack ... how many time you can?

[2023-01-04 22:48:27] <%Coizu> @Coizu But how long did it take you to get used to it and how did it affect you until that point? Also everyone is different so if it affects one key player a lot it could already be problematic

[2023-01-04 22:48:51] <vvs_dre> @vvs_dre thos were added into the later stages of WoW.. even PVP its trying to incorpate an MMO RPG into competitive gamaing scene
[2023-01-04 22:48:58] <vvs_dre> if it was that competitive, u guys would all have the same gear
[2023-01-04 22:49:13] <Chubbypaws21> I agree that having same release times would be better for RWF. But what about all of the other people not competing in world first. Would that not just mess them all around.
[2023-01-04 22:49:23] <MILEEES> but Gingi, are u sure u will adapt to US timezone the whole raid days? the longer a race goes the more you will prolly go back to EU times right?
[2023-01-04 22:49:30] <kraftVAERK_> A huge amount of planning must go into the world first race? What is the hardest, planning or progressing?
[2023-01-04 22:49:31] <+rosstherosstrich> I wish wow and FFXIV had the same loot so you can eventually jus buy your gear with toekns
[2023-01-04 22:49:33] <%purplegoofy> are you going to play frost pr arcane for m+ during the season? @GingiTV
[2023-01-04 22:49:38] <blade23master> How many players are in Echo?
[2023-01-04 22:49:50] <+zarrzxtv> @vvs_dre in the mdi and great push they all have same gear doesnt matter if it was added later whut lol i see what you're saying for pvp tho when it comes to the regular game

[2023-01-04 22:50:45] <+KW_Kryptikk> Like 3pm if you use the PST time
[2023-01-04 22:50:48] <+mattjee1> i think if they make global release they will push it back compared to normal US release

[2023-01-04 23:40:24] <morgott21> @20PAP4R all classes have a good amount of buttons to press, but most are not buttons you press often in your rotation, a lot are defences, utilities... if you want an easy class for roration than fury warr, havoc DH or BM hunter

[2023-01-04 23:45:28] <Godtsen> @morgott21 You clearly don't know what the DH rotation is like right now. And yeah, I have a DH alt, that doesn't invalidate what I'm saying. DH currently plays momentum, and it's not easy to play, and defniitely not in the same league as fury and BM hunter..
