[2022-12-22 18:18:40] <+lamename_twitch> He's collecting the amulets so he can identify them and show us how to detemrine if they are valuable or not.

[2022-12-22 18:28:48] <polygamoos3> @luiso4123 It's possible but it's probably the most difficult build to do sanctums with.
[2022-12-22 18:28:54] <Axyle231> I feel RF is safe, but real slow for sanctum.

[2022-12-22 18:42:32] <SolidLogik> Hey Pohx when starting RF at 34, is it normal to be using life flasks to keep RF up?
[2022-12-22 18:42:50] <%Xuletz> I was more thinking of the interaction with immortal flesh @pohx
[2022-12-22 18:43:05] <@%donavanshepard> @paddyx3 alright sec let me get on and check
[2022-12-22 18:43:07] <reyjinn> @SolidLogik you are missing either regen or resist
[2022-12-22 18:43:13] <polygamoos3> @SolidLogik No, not normal. At 34ish when I started, I had about double the life regen necessary to sustain.
[2022-12-22 18:43:18] <%Xuletz> noted
[2022-12-22 18:43:23] <+TheFrankHorrigan> @SolidLogik stone golem and vit should keep up with rf degen
[2022-12-22 18:43:24] <+TheFrankHorrigan> no?

[2022-12-22 18:43:38] <SolidLogik> @reyjinn I'm missing the regen then, because in my hideout I have to use flasks to keep RF up

[2022-12-22 18:44:18] <polygamoos3> Basically, the more meta builds you know in great detail, the more value you can extract from random loot you find.
[2022-12-22 18:44:18] <Demmou> @MOKlN Does Inflation effect poor people?
[2022-12-22 18:44:18] <%MsSinclaire> that sounds useful I'm bad at figuring out if something is good
[2022-12-22 18:44:32] <@%donavanshepard> @paddyx3 what dex craft you need... str and dex or dex and int
[2022-12-22 18:44:38] <reyjinn> when switching over I think you should have either 78 or 79% fire resist... just from the tree
[2022-12-22 18:44:52] <%Xuletz> it all depends on what's your definition of casual

[2022-12-22 19:23:59] <@%GoGoLoThirty> @Moxsy yeah theres a lot of reading unfortunately. the game kinda expects u to read text that is normally pure flavour text in other games. its a bit weird but you get used to it i think

[2022-12-22 19:37:54] <@%GoGoLoThirty> @DerRasierer there is greed for life or envy for chaos res. chaos res is less consistent but should have a better chance rolling something pog because chaos weighting is low.

[2022-12-22 19:39:26] <mab0913> not worth fight 99% time
[2022-12-22 19:39:38] <+Gunsenhouse> Yes, but mostly because of the degen that keeps stacking forever
[2022-12-22 19:39:40] <@%GoGoLoThirty> @DerRasierer screaming bare min. you would use higher ideally imo, but again depends on budget

[2022-12-22 20:30:31] <@%GoGoLoThirty> I am glad this turned into an exercise showing that amulets are good every 1 in 50 amulets lol
[2022-12-22 20:30:38] <@%GoGoLoThirty> this has been my experience too
[2022-12-22 20:30:59] <adolebitque> The thing about ID'ing gear is that +1 to all skill gems is 1/1500 for example, and if we assume an average of 2.5 prefixes per amulet (which is slightly generous), you can think of the chance of ID'ing one such mod at 2.5/1500
[2022-12-22 20:31:21] <%$Janzxer> I currently have +3 max fire res, so I'm still hunting better, have 90% fire res tho :D
[2022-12-22 20:31:21] <@%lemoncoolers> \
[2022-12-22 20:31:26] <@%GoGoLoThirty> @adolebitque wouldnt it be slightly less because youre assuming the weighting is equal with that 2.5/1500

[2022-12-22 20:32:07] <adolebitque> @GoGoLoThirty WDYM equal weighting? If you add a random prefix to a high ilevel amulet, it has an approximately 1/1500 chance of being +1 to all skill gems

[2022-12-22 20:33:59] <@%GoGoLoThirty> @adolebitque right but how can you just multiple that by the number of possible prefixes? Im not very good at math but that doesnt make sense to me. you would be assuming that it has an equal chance compared to the other prefixes that could fill those two slots. if you're rolling twice, it wouldnt be 1/1500 x 2
[2022-12-22 20:34:01] <VeeohTV> Im followed your build this league and i wanted to thank you for it. There is SO MUCH great information and im pushing harder into endgame content than i ever have. Cheers!

[2022-12-22 20:37:38] <adolebitque> @GoGoLoThirty 1842 is the more accurate weighting so it'd be 1/1842 for "one prefix" to be +1 to all skill gems

[2022-12-22 20:38:05] <@%GoGoLoThirty> @adolebitque yeah i was just confused about the 2.5 average prefixes making it 2.5/1842
[2022-12-22 20:38:08] <adolebitque> It's not exactly 2,5/1842, but very close to it when we consider the case where we pretend we'll have an average of 2,5 prefixes per ID

[2022-12-22 20:41:40] <adolebitque> Again, I don't consider the very small change in the weighting that happens since we can't roll the same non-+1 prefix more than once per amulet (this is the folly)

[2022-12-22 21:15:02] <MintberryCrunchS> How you sustain a map like cage at the start of an ssf journey when you farm chains on it?
[2022-12-22 21:15:10] <convay121> yeah level 25 auras seems good at late progression, they just sell slowly

[2022-12-22 21:21:36] <DeCoyThatGuy> adding a veil mod
[2022-12-22 21:21:39] <+Fahqu420> the one where the guy follows you is pretty sick it lets you have one of his aura's and mods from his equipment on maps from heist nodes
[2022-12-22 21:21:40] <adolebitque> Armor quality is "good", socket colour
[2022-12-22 21:21:42] <DeCoyThatGuy> white sockets

[2022-12-22 21:25:33] <Oct0_Pus> rog is a bait in ssf i feel tbh ur far better off getting essences

[2022-12-22 21:33:12] <+furpnate> that part is irrelevant, it basically turns every favorite map into a never drop block

[2022-12-22 21:35:41] <%$Janzxer> Well yeah in that sense, there is always a better build. But it's not that bad for sanctum, there is worse
[2022-12-22 21:35:56] <+P0XYFR34K> im assuming i cant just spam alterations to get increased mana efficiency on a jewel in ssf?

[2022-12-22 21:36:02] <%$Janzxer> But just learning the layouts and monster makes it quite a bit easier.

[2022-12-22 21:36:08] <adolebitque> Cast on death
[2022-12-22 21:36:11] <%$Janzxer> Viper strike
[2022-12-22 21:36:12] <ToraTorita> Well, I arrived at t16 with acts itams...  xd
[2022-12-22 21:36:21] <+Unsaken1> Poison concoction?

[2022-12-22 21:36:37] <$Enaio> I played Bladestorm in the beginning of the League... melee sucks in this league
[2022-12-22 21:36:41] <+furpnate> RF is bad for sanctum but relics can carry so hard. I have two that give 50 inspiration on minor affliction gain. Havent lost a sanctum yet since then

[2022-12-22 21:36:47] <%+Degorous> where i can find a cleave build? FeelsGoodMan
[2022-12-22 21:37:00] <Sharpblazer> You go Kirac first or the Syndicate part first?
[2022-12-22 21:37:06] <Oct0_Pus> i felt like playing totems was the play this league, man was i right
[2022-12-22 21:37:15] <convay121> relics are both broken and infuriating
[2022-12-22 21:37:20] <antanoripdriptan> Fire trap is pretty damn good, and staying close to the guards in sanctum makes it easier to run around in cirles. And RF can tank last boss weird phase
[2022-12-22 21:37:27] <%$Janzxer> Yea, I have constant 1000 inspiration :D
[2022-12-22 21:37:31] <+furpnate> yeah and its rng in the end, since they are account-bound
[2022-12-22 21:37:38] <adolebitque> I've done a full T16 run in Sanctum on your RF, but especially in some of the gauntlet rooms I'm just not enjoying life, so I'm doing everything except the league mechanic on your RF and will do a league mechanic character later on
[2022-12-22 21:38:35] <+furpnate> ranged is so much better yeah, someone on reddit did a no-hit sanctum run with tornado shot
[2022-12-22 21:38:35] <%$Janzxer> Also I prefer to use flame dash instead of frost blink, so easy to dodge pretty much anything
[2022-12-22 21:38:36] <kruger2> doesnt mean we need to roll diff char for sanctum
[2022-12-22 21:38:40] <Oct0_Pus> for normal gameplay kirac is the best, it gives you the shop refresh as well as unique maps, its good

[2022-12-22 21:39:40] <%SearingDarkness> Honestly I've been having tons of fun with Sanctum RF because it feels just like a proper hard roguelike

[2022-12-22 21:40:02] <%$Janzxer> I mean if I'd had better helmet, pretty sure I could do no hit run on sanctum with RF only :D
[2022-12-22 21:40:12] <+twitchaccountforsmite> How much dps did you get out of your Empower change on your setup?
