[2022-12-15 21:02:55] <pepefrogqt> they have to nerf rogue and dh and priest and druid otherwise the other heroes will remain unplayable
[2022-12-15 21:03:11] <Vengeance_88> I think they will make unleash fell not hit face
[2022-12-15 21:03:23] <genius69> if he doesnt kill u u have lethal prob

[2022-12-15 21:03:59] <worldcitizen92> @MeatiHS  will DR rogue be nerfed?
[2022-12-15 21:04:01] <Grognosh2> everyone is bringing it for worlds
[2022-12-15 21:04:05] <toprizzxox> they gotta nerf druid too
[2022-12-15 21:04:14] <toprizzxox> and rouge
[2022-12-15 21:04:18] <genius69> how about they buff the others instead of nerf ?
[2022-12-15 21:04:20] <Throgvar> DH quest reward would be "Your charge minions have +1 attack"
[2022-12-15 21:04:23] <+SirScrapsHawk> rogue nerf def
[2022-12-15 21:04:30] <pepefrogqt> druid needs to be nerfed too otherwise it will dominate hard if rog and dh are nerfed
[2022-12-15 21:04:30] <Vengeance_88> Druid will get nerfed itself after guff rotates

[2022-12-15 21:05:14] <poogyboy> that was fun and interactive :)
[2022-12-15 21:05:25] <alexmirash> this deck is a joke
[2022-12-15 21:05:31] <+willbrisco> Fel target minions only

[2022-12-15 21:06:12] <genius69> its always the same gameplay
[2022-12-15 21:06:15] <poogyboy> it's honestly unleash fel being able to target enemys
[2022-12-15 21:06:16] <+willbrisco> Just make fel target minions and the deck is gone
[2022-12-15 21:06:32] <waffa1> that would actually be fun, remove your view of enemy class & hand. only keep the board

[2022-12-15 21:07:49] <pepefrogqt> yeah dk is meme tier
[2022-12-15 21:08:02] <generallycrappy13> 1 mana draw four discount 14 mana jeepers
[2022-12-15 21:08:07] <D0nDi4blo> i mean thijs smewhat made it work in top 100
[2022-12-15 21:08:09] <waffa1> DK is fun to play, as both frost aggro & blood control, but it's pbad
[2022-12-15 21:08:13] <D0nDi4blo> but its just... yeahh
[2022-12-15 21:08:16] <genius69> isnt dk frost alright ? not op but not that bad
[2022-12-15 21:08:24] <pepefrogqt> dk can only win if you get extremely lucky with patchwerk / mutanus
[2022-12-15 21:08:24] <D0nDi4blo> i mean u have a hard time dealing with this highroll BS
[2022-12-15 21:08:35] <pepefrogqt> or theotar
[2022-12-15 21:08:38] <waffa1> theo is also trying to make blood DK work in top 100, but it's just relying on removing all combo cards from DH's

[2022-12-15 21:08:59] <pepefrogqt> yeah thats the only way dk can win is to get lucky with  removals
[2022-12-15 21:09:04] <youngmoneygangsterqq> if you played thief rogue and only took warrior cards would it have a higher wr than playing warrior
[2022-12-15 21:09:04] <waffa1> tbf everything is "alright" at best vs the broken meta decks
[2022-12-15 21:09:04] <pepefrogqt> if they dont get lucky its gg insta lose
[2022-12-15 21:09:05] <genius69> @lamamaycry its prob not DK being bad , its those 4 other class being OP
[2022-12-15 21:09:07] <Vengeance_88> Blood dk gets slapped hard by dh
[2022-12-15 21:09:23] <tsjipper> How come we have 0 DKs in worlds?
[2022-12-15 21:09:38] <pepefrogqt> because dk isnt good
[2022-12-15 21:09:55] <D0nDi4blo> yeah but thats the problem - i dont want to play games that just evolve around disrupting ur opponent cause otherwise the sole order of cards in his deck decide the outcome of the match
[2022-12-15 21:10:00] <D0nDi4blo> that is just boring

[2022-12-15 21:10:43] <Yristul> rune system lowkey hurts dk
[2022-12-15 21:10:44] <genius69> @MeatiHS isnt it a bit hard to say its not that good ? feels like its just the rest being OP rn
[2022-12-15 21:10:46] <+saa_soli> i think you could've fel barraged instead of second extinction for lethal
[2022-12-15 21:10:47] <cointerm> jambre's shaman is good if you're in Diamond. it eats DR rogues
[2022-12-15 21:10:47] <Vengeance_88> You think dk is bad or other classes are oppressive?
[2022-12-15 21:10:49] <pepefrogqt> i love watching rogues get stomped

[2022-12-15 21:10:59] <+SirScrapsHawk> They balanced DK so much it is awful lmao
[2022-12-15 21:11:14] <+SirScrapsHawk> they didnt want to repeat what happened with DH
[2022-12-15 21:11:17] <%OxyZ1_> You can also tilte your enemy
[2022-12-15 21:11:17] <+Alpr1010> DK is just too fair
[2022-12-15 21:11:18] <+bluedevilblue> Frost DK is fun, but losing sucks and is not fun.
[2022-12-15 21:11:30] <Yristul> dk just having fewer possible cards per archetype hurts it
[2022-12-15 21:11:31] <+Alpr1010> Beast Hunter is the right kind of Fair though. Just got legend with it for first time
[2022-12-15 21:11:34] <+bluedevilblue> So frost DK ends up not being fun.
[2022-12-15 21:11:42] <+Alpr1010> tech'd in royal librarian & tarantulas though
[2022-12-15 21:11:45] <Vengeance_88> DK doesnt feel like a new class more like a forgotten one
[2022-12-15 21:11:50] <genius69> @SirScrapsHawk the rune system kinda cuck them , they have good cards in every runes but u need to commit in those and then u cant have the rest of the goods meanwhile other class have everything
[2022-12-15 21:11:51] <AcezWild> more than losing
[2022-12-15 21:11:52] <+fratley21> it will be better after the rotation. this way was way better than the demon hunter release
[2022-12-15 21:11:52] <AcezWild> yea lol
[2022-12-15 21:11:53] <cointerm> i gave up after a week of frost. it's almost there
[2022-12-15 21:12:10] <+bluedevilblue> so close, but not close enough.
[2022-12-15 21:12:22] <6Moriarty9> no its not

[2022-12-15 21:12:39] VIEWERS: 924
[2022-12-15 21:12:39] <D0nDi4blo> great take
[2022-12-15 21:12:41] <pez_hs> i hin kthey did the runes... jsut to have a better way to nerf cards... and not change the card itsel.. jsut change amount the runes you need to play it
[2022-12-15 21:12:47] <+bluedevilblue> If they did that, would help other classes, too.  Shaman, Mage, etc.
[2022-12-15 21:12:57] <D0nDi4blo> if it wasnt for this BS DK wuld be a SUPEr enjoyable class
[2022-12-15 21:13:04] <%scientific_b_assist> DK may be a class designed for arena. There it is very strong
[2022-12-15 21:13:23] <Vengeance_88> You think dk got released on time or soon/later?
[2022-12-15 21:13:28] <curtarc> Warrior needs a buff though. Don't see Warrior doing much even if they nerf other classes
[2022-12-15 21:13:41] <+SirScrapsHawk> @scientific_b_assist Do the runes affect deck building in Arena?
[2022-12-15 21:13:51] <+bluedevilblue> Warrior does need a buff.  Their new set is all weaker than everyone else's.
[2022-12-15 21:14:14] <youngmoneygangsterqq> its seems like every warrior set has been weaker since like naxx lol
[2022-12-15 21:14:32] <pepefrogqt> warrior is just sad

[2022-12-15 21:15:21] <%scientific_b_assist> @scientific_b_assist I'm not sure because almost every DK is strong in arena. Every card that let's you create value is strong

[2022-12-15 21:18:52] <youngmoneygangsterqq> all those are tier 2 on hsreplay, so youre kinda right, none are tier 1
[2022-12-15 21:18:55] <Vengeance_88> 1 person didnt bring quest dh i think
[2022-12-15 21:18:57] <Yristul> aggro is just super easy
[2022-12-15 21:19:06] <Yristul> ease of play is a big thing
[2022-12-15 21:19:17] <%+MrDeeJay> doesnt the data have tiers for each rank tho?
[2022-12-15 21:19:19] <%+Agamemnon_UK> Wrong on purpose to make puppies spend money to get extra decks
[2022-12-15 21:19:21] <Vengeance_88> Tiers are determined by winrate so its biased
[2022-12-15 21:19:28] <Dannying> The data isn‚Äôt filtered

[2022-12-15 21:19:33] <+datfrogger> vicious syndicate meta report has boon priest and quest DH as the top 2 decks in the game
[2022-12-15 21:19:37] <+datfrogger> in the stats
[2022-12-15 21:19:39] <Yristul> at low ranks less mistskes cus the deck is good leads to higher winrate
[2022-12-15 21:19:43] <youngmoneygangsterqq> id like to look in specific ranks but you have to pay to see that data KEKL
[2022-12-15 21:19:47] <Bladefire20> Well you're not just taking decks to worlds that are good, you're taking decks that counter other decks and cover your other deck's weaknesses
[2022-12-15 21:19:56] <+bluedevilblue> I think lower level players win with it because it is easier to play.  Lots of misplays of the top decks at lower levels.

[2022-12-15 21:21:26] <%+MrDeeJay> the highest win % on high legend is bless priest not imp warlock  @MeatiHS

[2022-12-15 21:21:29] <Alexander2606> as a player who never reached legend before and is currently platinum 7 struggles with this dh list a lost compared to imp warlock
[2022-12-15 21:21:33] <Yristul> boon has a lot of edge cases

[2022-12-15 23:01:03] <KingOfWatch> @MeatiHS how exactly does the quest reward work? do you get a discount for every card youve drawn ever or only in that specific turn? @MeatiHS

[2022-12-15 23:53:24] <stillnotking75> the mulligan is kinda tricky because you have to think about how to complete the quest

[2022-12-15 23:53:39] <+leon3739> I did my RCA Jan 2021, was BS
[2022-12-15 23:53:39] <BakedZnake> isnt RCA a car breakdown service?
[2022-12-15 23:53:47] <BigBlueBottle> Royal College of Art?
[2022-12-15 23:53:59] <+leon3739> Yep
[2022-12-15 23:54:02] <@%tictac_hs> @g0thbaddie Thing is, the best deck is the deck that wins most at top legend, not the deck that wins most at diamond to legend or whatever and in top legend people are playing a ton of druid
[2022-12-15 23:54:12] <+leon3739> Part timer, I do 2.5 sessions
[2022-12-15 23:54:13] <Antoinesko> i am gp too :)

[2022-12-15 23:54:20] <@%+DanTheGreat94> where are the mathematicians :(
[2022-12-15 23:54:25] <g0thbaddie> @tictac_hs most people aren't at top legend that isn't the best for most people necessarily
[2022-12-15 23:54:26] <%+1mikas> I am GPU they call me G-force
[2022-12-15 23:54:33] <stillnotking75> you're looking at top legend right now, do you see a ton of druid?
[2022-12-15 23:54:34] <Antoinesko> gp=gay btw
[2022-12-15 23:54:38] <!Mikitko> @bargilia KEKW

[2022-12-15 23:54:43] <+MstafaNabeel_OW> Here is an AIR TRAFIC CONTROLLER
[2022-12-15 23:54:51] <@%tictac_hs> @g0thbaddie Yeah, which is why VS sucks for high legend players and which is why I've never taken it seriously
[2022-12-15 23:54:51] <@%DerPeetz> i did my RCA so good, i slammed the mugihumbus in it so hard! (no clue what im talking about Kappa )
[2022-12-15 23:55:01] <+MstafaNabeel_OW> WHO IS AN AREA CONTROLLER HER
[2022-12-15 23:55:01] <+reaperonetho> @MeatiHS do you work in a hospital or in a private clinic?
[2022-12-15 23:55:12] <+leon3739> Yeppp never going back
[2022-12-15 23:55:12] <@%tictac_hs> @g0thbaddie And which is also why I'll keep telling people that druid is good, because it literally is
[2022-12-15 23:55:14] <BigBlueBottle> Can I sexually identify as a GP? :)
[2022-12-15 23:55:22] <Throgvar> Imagine going to a doctor and it's bloody Meatman Pog

[2022-12-15 23:55:44] <g0thbaddie> @tictac_hs you can still look at legend stats. honest question are you dumb becaue i'm not talking about what is best for you and your responses clearly are implying what i'm saying is wrong for 99% of players which is just isn't
[2022-12-15 23:55:46] <@%+DanTheGreat94> just do maths guys
[2022-12-15 23:55:51] <@%+DanTheGreat94> maths is fun  :)
[2022-12-15 23:56:09] <BigBlueBottle> Wait, is it pronounced GP, or JP?

[2022-12-15 23:56:19] <g0thbaddie> @tictac_hs for like you and your 6 friends no one cares what deck if played perfectly is best they can't do that
[2022-12-15 23:56:24] <%+apexwarden> do you get more money from streaming hearthstone or being a doc? cuz you stream alot
[2022-12-15 23:56:24] <edshades_> can u believe theres 3 losers not playing DH at worlds

[2022-12-15 23:57:45] <g0thbaddie> yeah when i said "use vs report it has good information about decks at various levels of play" i meant top 10 players should definitely be exclusively looking at it and play what is best at diamond that is obviously a fair and reasonable take
[2022-12-15 23:57:55] <Vegaskko> Hello resttL
[2022-12-15 23:58:00] <just_blade_> why dont we play sir finley in this deck, it completes quest and put jace back if hes in opening hand??
[2022-12-15 23:58:00] <BigBlueBottle> Its almost as if Twtich is not a real job :)
[2022-12-15 23:58:02] <danian45769> Its so strange that you like the worst Itzy song imo
