[2023-01-08 11:28:41] <%fmvgomes> Foch made his way out of the CC program with the Chrysler video, and although he did talk the truth he also was pissed and wanted to piss someone off, and he did just that
[2023-01-08 11:28:45] <zuna_fanboy> And here I thought they complain because it's the best performing T8 tank, even outperforming some TX tanks. Silly me.

[2023-01-08 11:59:13] <zuna_fanboy> Bad players are bad, good players are good. I was just trying to say that when a tank has disproportionately high dpg and win rate, then I think it is overpowered. I don't think me being a bad player changes that, just like I don't think my 3 marks on Panther 88 make it a good tank. I was just pointing out statistics, I apologise if I said it disrespectfully.

[2023-01-08 12:19:38] <MUGEZUIKKELI> I remember the days when is-6 and wz-111 used to fight against in every battle :D
[2023-01-08 12:19:43] <zuna_fanboy> It's wonderful. Except it turns like a boat and couldn't hit one.
[2023-01-08 12:20:06] <MUGEZUIKKELI> @orlin_19 I'd say it is bad nowdays, since there is too many strong tier 9 tanks that it can play against
[2023-01-08 12:20:20] <zuna_fanboy> IIRC they made the BZ roof 41mm so the 122s cannot overmatch it.

[2023-01-08 12:22:27] <@^Nightbot> Orza got the tank for 30K. Decent tank, very nice acceleration but no high top speed, nice turret armor, ok-ish gun handling, dispersion not very good on the move, decent pen with standard and gold, nice dmg potential, decent gun depression, mediocre moneymaker, average viewrange. Play it like a heavy using the turret, not so much flanking around and the lack of speed will not be a problem. Overall decent tank.

New subs or resubs have the benefit of one free tank request/stats check with their sub/resub message, provided that Orza has that tank in garage.

[2023-01-08 14:26:21] <Leventhe> I already have Liberte and Patriot, another tank with 8000 bonds?
[2023-01-08 14:26:22] <%+cavaleruu> !bonds
[2023-01-08 14:26:22] <@^Nightbot> None of the Tier X tanks for bonds are worth it. Libert√® or Guard if u want to make credits, Chrysler if you want something overpowered.

[2023-01-08 14:28:12] <%+cavaleruu> guys he asked a tank to do credits and buy with bonds... focus on the questions
[2023-01-08 14:28:18] <NunexTK> theres no such thing as "the best premium"
[2023-01-08 14:28:32] <NunexTK> the best premium is the one that you perform the best in
[2023-01-08 14:28:45] <%+cavaleruu> @madmax_365 read the question before sugesting tanks
[2023-01-08 14:28:56] <Leventhe> I have around 2000 wn8 but not a lot of premiums for credits
[2023-01-08 14:29:03] <NunexTK> i usually make a lot of credits with the guard
[2023-01-08 14:29:14] <%+CallMeRazzie> yeah sure Nunex, then go play your guard against mine BZ

[2023-01-08 14:29:46] <+BAGHEAD2004> !premium
[2023-01-08 14:29:47] <@^Nightbot> Orzy recommends for average/not so good players Defender, IS3-A, Object 703 if for sale, if not L√∂we also works. From the bond shop Liberte and Guard. For more experienced players/good players the previous tanks also apply + Su-130, Skopion G, Progetto, ShPtk,Object 274a for grinding credits. Other OP premiums that suck at moneymaking can be Chrysler, Skoda T56, Bourrasque. For Light Tanks, M41 GF and LT432.
[2023-01-08 14:29:47] <%+cavaleruu> yes @i0r115  for bonds
[2023-01-08 14:29:51] <NunexTK> your armor isnt reliable and your dpm isnt the best
[2023-01-08 14:30:01] <NunexTK> but hitting for 390 at tier 8 is pretty good and the gun is also very nice
