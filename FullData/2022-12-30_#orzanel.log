Yet some idiot from my team, messaged me said I was a bot and they would report me for inactivity, the map was Steppes, I was constantly moving flank to flank, trying to give support when needed. I actually felt like deinstalling the game after that.

[2022-12-30 11:30:54] <%+aaronp5041> Just a tip with higher power engines, make sure your fuel pressure is constant and stable. Because if it fluctuates then your ECU starts to see unstable AFR and starts to compensate for that which costs you power.
