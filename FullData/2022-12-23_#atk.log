[2022-12-23 17:35:43] <+nwrtz> might be weapon quality, salvation is better on worse weapon quality
[2022-12-23 17:35:58] <zercy03> @nwrtz wait really?
[2022-12-23 17:36:16] <zercy03> damn never heard of that
[2022-12-23 17:36:38] <FamiMisaki> On paper yes Nightmare is stronger with higher weapon quality. BUT you need to prevent going into endless mana state, you lose a ton more DPS if you are in that state
[2022-12-23 17:37:08] <FamiMisaki> if you can maintain the mana addiction state you deal more. Otherwise you become a little weaker than salvation set. So up to you if u can manage mana

[2022-12-23 22:31:29] <+JokeStarXV> @ATK I had an idea the other day for content fatigue. What if instead of chaos dungeon you could choose one of the mini games they release, pvp or the moba to earn chaos rewards
[2022-12-23 22:31:30] <+Lookana> Right now I kind of wish you could still run the last legion raid just for cards kinda like running the lower abyss.  But I also just enjoy the raids a ton
