[2023-01-10 11:19:10] <zsba> morning stokes
[2023-01-10 11:19:11] <cfc_Ray19> i can see them giving Bale a hero card even tho he deserves an icon.  A hero would be better for links anyway
[2023-01-10 11:19:15] <+marnzzz> stokes who is a good cb for 600k or under
[2023-01-10 11:19:15] <bwrca> Yaya Toure deserves an icon card

[2023-01-10 11:19:46] <RickyPizzle> He meant Terry Crews
[2023-01-10 11:19:47] <%aidan_acluvsufan_fan> that was wayne bridge no?
[2023-01-10 11:19:50] <%arnold_od18> Not ideal at all LOL
[2023-01-10 11:19:51] <@%+dezperado618> COnsidering most pros play Sunday LEague after retirnement, technically CR7 can become an icon since he is currently doing the same
[2023-01-10 11:19:53] <stepdro> @daworldpeace would you give him a hero or icon card?
[2023-01-10 11:19:55] <Lwilko99> Nah Stephen bunting is the one
[2023-01-10 11:19:55] <rygn922> You look like yaya toure
[2023-01-10 11:19:59] <+narbsie> yh hero is a good shout for bale. certainly last few years he's been about moments in key games really

[2023-01-10 11:20:08] <@%+lizardking82> Not ideal. Bit of an understatement
[2023-01-10 11:20:12] <+helpme87> Hero CR7 from the Saudi league would be a laugh
[2023-01-10 11:20:12] <%+whltemagnum> When JT did that to Wayne Bridge apparently wayne bridges instant response was "noted"
[2023-01-10 11:20:13] <itsRamzilla> I always thought you looked like Kimbo Slice.

[2023-01-10 11:20:38] <cfc_Ray19> @fifa_swift22 yeah i could see it, not as old as other icons. Hero would be more useful too. Obviously based on abiliity he's an icon

[2023-01-10 12:38:53] <%zmlkc> i dont mind finesses being strong bc who doesnt love seeing them fly topbins, far more realistic than trivelas lol
[2023-01-10 12:38:56] <+ajetovic> @arnold_od18 i agree but the should fix the animation keepers make when they concede a finesse because i dont want him to look like a spastic its just triggering
[2023-01-10 12:38:58] <iver_b> Only sometimes tho
[2023-01-10 12:39:01] <+xxreddevil16xx> It's criminal that they're patching corners when we still have goal keepers with half the diving out of the way animations they have

[2023-01-10 12:41:17] <toastd39_> I'm on old gen and I can do it. L1 then take your cross as normal. after you've finished your power it will swap cam. then press square again and it will take the corner as you aimed it and powered it up before

[2023-01-10 12:49:59] <JackAFC14> Most of the toty nominess has very heavy world cup tax
[2023-01-10 12:50:03] <SMACKYOU4NOTHING> Does someone know why Pele is so slow in game? Get five moments per match where he get bullied and not speed boost
[2023-01-10 12:50:09] <octavian29592> one day a legend will win FGS with a low tier team

[2023-01-10 12:53:12] <%+palachu_04> alaba should be there, at this point EA might just want to avoid a full Real, PSG team with maybe some City players
[2023-01-10 12:53:13] <FrostyYSL_> Would 90 Trent be a good midfielder
[2023-01-10 12:53:16] <+76ersgoat4> did u hear about the toty icons
[2023-01-10 12:53:25] <%pablo_kash> yo stokes when is the best time to use the double tap x pass? the slightly off the ground one?
[2023-01-10 12:53:33] <kookaburra_fc> even more effective when you run into the space
[2023-01-10 12:53:33] <androzaa> don't need a swinger, a lefty also take a left corner. just the same only move it to the backline your aim thing

You can keep your statistics. I prefer the magic.
