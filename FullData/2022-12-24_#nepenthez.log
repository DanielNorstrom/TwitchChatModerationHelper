[2022-12-24 15:43:10] <sterudd123> I was thinking earlier, I think it would be a good idea to release World Cup managers, so If you use the Portugal World Cup manager it auto gives ronaldo 2 chem, like make it so you can change the league on them
[2022-12-24 15:43:16] <+0lly> @crimi25 except my plyers don't want to make contact and treat is like speed skating
[2022-12-24 15:43:17] <000skeletor000> its good having so many elite cards in draft. WC Smolerek is next level

[2022-12-24 15:43:37] <+johndecoyfifa> I think the 1000  coin boost should be standard when you win a match, it makes such a difference

[2022-12-24 16:53:53] <%+anth0ny0rrell> course there is scripting in the game, it was the 45th min the game wanted him to score. not saying it decides the result but it decides outcomes during the game regardless of what the person is doing

[2022-12-24 17:08:40] <%bluemooner1990> @Danthegooner46 No no, not pressure making people lose composure, it affects the mentality of the in game players. IMO, that's a problem. If you're under pressure, it should be down to the individual using the controller to make a mistake, not the actual virtual players making mistakes.

[2022-12-24 20:02:17] <%BrackenWBA10> I think it killed them to have to release them before toty

[2022-12-24 20:03:53] <godreid> Should i keep the bronze players that are worth nothing or sell them?
[2022-12-24 20:03:56] <kevintherandomdude> the 11 from 1 club is impossible

[2022-12-24 20:04:08] <realmythicflame> This 1 club squad is really annoying, should I just leave it for a while or do you recommend buying?
[2022-12-24 20:04:09] <+Twist0301> Suds count as rares
[2022-12-24 20:04:10] <+Jamie602> think ill wait a week and pay 11k for the whole one club teams rather than 11k for 2 players right now
[2022-12-24 20:04:15] <%+chriscfcwooooo> I'd 100% recommend not even look at league sbcs today. BPM will make u rich right now.
[2022-12-24 20:04:16] <shazik192> Stocked club with bronze French for 200 each. Like the profits

[2022-12-24 20:35:05] <%+danarlli> Is the fact you can get 5 position modifiers for a bronze and yet spend 1,500 coins on the market
[2022-12-24 20:35:10] <Zolious> is bpm the move
[2022-12-24 20:35:13] VIEWERS: 4 891

[2022-12-24 20:35:29] <+jefzy_> Do u kinda wish u stayed with no fp spent on this account?
[2022-12-24 20:35:31] <+arthur_dx> players from Belgium league is selling
[2022-12-24 20:35:32] <%+gpnick7> surely all lg sbcs do is make certain cheap cards expensive and higher rated cards cheaper in the long run?
[2022-12-24 20:35:36] <Zolious> sorry if this was answered but, should i keep or sell bronze players worth 200 from bpm
[2022-12-24 20:35:38] <kingkurdo00> what is bpm
[2022-12-24 20:35:38] <+Fornicras> people overpay because searching for a card that goes 100coins cheaper is tiresome, the just dont care, menus are so slow to navigate around (on PC at least)
[2022-12-24 20:35:41] <+V10Vernon> merry christmas nep, btw bought that winter icon pack got van persie, made the coins back in selling league sbc cards

[2022-12-24 20:36:13] <+Bailey28J> I have opened about 40K worth of BPM and started at 890K i am now at 920K with stuff selling
[2022-12-24 20:36:19] <Zolious> should i keep or sell bronze players worth 200 from bpm
[2022-12-24 20:36:26] <+MiernikGaming> Tell you what, the theory you had on price vs pack weight is so true. The amount of commons listed when they were 600 was like every search. Now they're updated for 9k on futbin, every 30-40 searches
[2022-12-24 20:36:32] <nikhorvat99> @Zolious keep

[2022-12-24 20:41:23] <+ace280> Both upgrade sbcs cost 90k to complete total. They need to be done 5 times each. So it’s 450k for packs which are untradeable, and in those packs you will probably get like ~8 walkouts total. If each of the 11x 81+ packs have a walkout. 450k for like, good case, 10 untradeable walkouts isn’t worth it imo.

[2022-12-24 21:09:25] <+bbking84> bpm is always a good idea. List ALL non rare players. Always worth a try to sell a bronze at 200. Send everything that doesnt sell to the club. Check rares if they are 300+ sell, if not keep until they are. Imagine you had your club stacked with 1000+ bronzes right now. Its not always insta profit, but slow profit is also better than no profit. And hitting a Brazil Manager, or a totw when those are in packs. It adds up.

[2022-12-24 21:22:07] <+nultwintiger020> angers is the best option
[2022-12-24 21:22:08] <%$KopiteJosh> Every league SBC that EA have ever done they've always made sure there's at least 1 segment that's more expensive than it probably should be
