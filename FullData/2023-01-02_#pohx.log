[2023-01-02 16:43:32] <%+gunnar50o1> there's a f2p version of the battlepass cosmetic i think that changes seasonally

[2023-01-02 16:45:09] <Argenthor> Hello Mr. Streamer. Have you ever thought about doing a RF Challenge? Taking ALL ascendancies to 100 with RF.
[2023-01-02 16:45:32] <Argenthor> Fair enough
[2023-01-02 16:45:44] <%+mrp1nk_live> @Pohx I think they make enough from supporter packs. They can probably get away with giving a single premium tab to incentivize more purchasing.
[2023-01-02 16:45:59] <butch3r_kush> getting a premium stash tab for Killing Kitava could be a great deal for ftp player

[2023-01-02 16:47:07] <Zwierzunio> hi is it worth getting into poe rn as a noob when poe2 is kinda on the way? hope ur having a good day bro @Pohx
[2023-01-02 16:47:25] <Strollein> Poe 2 on the way lol
[2023-01-02 16:47:27] <tatiantel7> poe2 isn't a brand new game
[2023-01-02 16:47:27] <Strollein> Nice joke
[2023-01-02 16:47:30] <@%lemoncoolers> @Zwierzunio you should learn it now. PoE 2 isn't going to be much different
[2023-01-02 16:47:31] <Illumina> PoE2 isn't a new game
[2023-01-02 16:47:34] <@%lemoncoolers> also PoE 2 is never coming out
[2023-01-02 16:47:41] <Illumina> PoE2 has also been two years away for 3 years
[2023-01-02 16:47:54] <+soshiruo> poe2 is also just added to the base game so you dont even lose anything
[2023-01-02 16:48:00] <%MrIceolator> hall of grand masters is the only map in poe i never completed KEKW
[2023-01-02 16:48:23] <+pvt__snowball> diablo 4 will hold us over until poe 2 releases :)
[2023-01-02 16:48:23] <shameer123321> poe2 is poe with extra steps :D
[2023-01-02 16:48:29] <%$threttz> Yeah it’s just adding on to poe1 is t it

[2023-01-02 16:49:01] <%+mrp1nk_live> Yeah sorry bud hate to break it to you but PoE2 is just PoE with a 2 after it. Kinda like Overwatch 2
[2023-01-02 16:49:17] <tawil_at_umr> like diablo immortal? it was made by chinese studio @Pohx
[2023-01-02 16:49:19] <Strollein> well yea its different people working on d4 compared to refunded, so there is hope
[2023-01-02 16:49:29] <%+mrp1nk_live> They are redesigning the campaign and stuff too
[2023-01-02 16:49:29] <@%lemoncoolers> New ascendancies, no more linked skills, new campaign.
[2023-01-02 16:49:30] <Illumina> werewolves
[2023-01-02 16:49:32] <tatiantel7> 19 more ascendancies for RF Pog
[2023-01-02 16:49:33] <Illumina> awoo
[2023-01-02 16:49:37] <Argenthor> New ascendancies is without doubt the most interesting thing in PoE 2
[2023-01-02 16:49:45] <+soshiruo> dont forget the spears as weapons! @Pohx

[2023-01-02 17:25:56] <MulletOfflane> @Pohx i just suck at math, so if my rf deals 100.000, a 40 inc is 40.000 more?
[2023-01-02 17:26:03] <@%GoGoLoThirty> @TheMikeSnow the bench is in your hideout!

[2023-01-02 17:26:48] <@%GoGoLoThirty> @MulletOfflane inc isnt calculated that way. there are a lot of difference damage formulas but a dps increase of 40k from 100k is not a 40% increase
[2023-01-02 17:26:50] <rony6634> to be honest fire trap really really strong for bossing thinking about to make sabo to see how much damage can push it
[2023-01-02 17:26:51] <MulletOfflane> @lemoncoolers ty lemon, so what number ish can i count on
[2023-01-02 17:26:56] <@%lemoncoolers> There is a damage formula on the wiki.

[2023-01-02 17:43:49] <%+Indifferus> i think he means like is the damage recouped numbers pre or post mitigation

[2023-01-02 17:45:46] <@%GoGoLoThirty> well your build is really smooth for you because youve played it a lot. its much more punishing to not go in with a really good plan in SSF, redoing things isnt easy
[2023-01-02 17:46:04] <simplygrass> crafting just lets you progress quicker i feel, I'm p new and am not good at crafting but I still make progress, just at a slower pace than if I knew how to craft goated gear

[2023-01-02 17:48:13] <@%GoGoLoThirty> @lemoncoolers its not honestly that great tho. betrayal is like the one mechanic that can still be confusing even if you read everything
[2023-01-02 17:48:27] <Arthrex> Why is it bad?
[2023-01-02 17:48:29] <@%GoGoLoThirty> mostly because there are choices you can make which arent necessarily super clear, and again, redoing stuff isnt easy in betrayal
[2023-01-02 17:48:41] <kagens> Might try and do a few bosses like elder/maven on rf
[2023-01-02 17:48:44] <kagens> to see how its like

[2023-01-02 17:48:55] <@%lemoncoolers> you never had a lot of agency over betrayal anyway. It's just about knowing how to mitigate the RNG of it.
[2023-01-02 17:48:57] <%idiotslayer> you want to keep the rivalries
[2023-01-02 17:49:04] <@%GoGoLoThirty> @kagens if you do maven bring a burn immune flask, they are fun tho

[2023-01-02 17:51:37] <kagens> i usualy just do what i like doing.. thats why im doing legion
[2023-01-02 17:51:52] <@%GoGoLoThirty> yeah i mean the way you teach is basically ideal. you are really good at teaching ppl how to figure stuff out rather than just feeding it to them without them actually getting it
[2023-01-02 17:52:08] <@%GoGoLoThirty> which isnt easy and definitely takes more effort than just saying what you think they should do

[2023-01-02 18:30:30] <@%GoGoLoThirty> @bananishwatermel00n atlas is really based on your personal preference and what you want to do in the endgame. you gotta set goals and figure out the path to achieve those goals
[2023-01-02 18:30:57] <@%GoGoLoThirty> @bananishwatermel00n there are no trash nodes on the atlas. i would avoid keystones if you dont know what youre doing, maybe try stream of consciousness since that one isnt really that weird

[2023-01-02 20:24:53] <%Strollein> The problem with that is that there are alot of parents that dont have time or know what to do so the easiest solution is just to ground the kids when they do something wrong
[2023-01-02 20:24:54] <%overwpowered> so your kid learns to be his/her greatest ally.

[2023-01-02 20:45:55] <StoneTheIceMan> Weird question. I didnt follow patch notes this league because WoW. Did Loreweave get buffed. I feel like i havent seen it in leagues and now multiple builds are running it.

[2023-01-02 20:53:16] <DarkKwiskas> did someone screenshotted/copy pasted the last atlas tree pohx is having? (not the one in !atlas command). knowing the good nodes for ssf is useful for me.

[2023-01-02 20:55:21] <%+Deedledo> @zerograviti  had a 3k armour chest, an energized armour in the templar spot, a 21 determ,

[2023-01-02 20:56:17] <@%GoGoLoThirty> @Zerograviti you dont need a basalt, 76k flasked with 50k noflask makes me think your flasks dont have a % armour increase roll which they probably should

My character has 5k+ HP, max all res (85 fire, 83 cold and lightning, and 80 chaos), 100k+ armor with flasks and stuff, but I still feels a lot of monka-S moments even in maps.

[2023-01-02 21:45:50] <+PisoMojado_> I saw in the wiki you would advise jugg for HC. Do you think suppression would be needed along with jugg or nah?
[2023-01-02 21:46:06] <kagens> dident even think about having some spare helmets laying in stash when doing labs
[2023-01-02 21:46:17] <%+IamDreameR_> You just need to face tank everything 4head
[2023-01-02 21:46:28] <@%GoGoLoThirty> if you can get suppression for low investment it can be nice. but we are left side tree with RF, not realistic

[2023-01-02 21:48:04] <+ArcticIceFox> where do I find info on explode RF? I think I reached the end of mid/early late progression. Looking to scale more atm
[2023-01-02 21:48:04] <@%GoGoLoThirty> we also need a different eldritch implicit on gloves. lots of builds can get the spell suppress implicit, not RF

[2023-01-02 21:49:20] <TSM_URF> yeah im hella bored and still play every day
[2023-01-02 21:49:22] <@%GoGoLoThirty> @Jozuel990 I started hc, still love it, but i play all leagues, they are just different. there is plenty of fun to be had outside of HC
[2023-01-02 21:49:26] <@%donavanshepard> but thats just like my opinion
[2023-01-02 21:49:27] <%ishlangu> Try playing with a different set of goals.
[2023-01-02 21:49:27] <+ArcticIceFox> yeah, I just got really lucky with rolls and gear....I basically got gear to get through red maps during white maps lmao. Just trying to do something else with the build. starting to feel bored. explode sounds interesting

[2023-01-02 21:51:13] <+Sval> my explode jugg is 35% through 99, but im having trouble getting to 100 just due to monotony

[2023-01-02 21:51:29] <@%GoGoLoThirty> @Jozuel990 which is a big reason i play all leagues. different ways to play for different vibes im feelin at whatever point

[2023-01-02 22:37:24] <@%GoGoLoThirty> also doesnt apply to most ppl but if you crave salty foods really hard late at night, you might wanna add a bit of sodium to your diet during the day, if youre someone really conscious of how much sodium you eat and usually avoid it. should help the cravings

[2023-01-02 22:40:08] <Desmaner> salty liquorice icecream
[2023-01-02 22:40:11] <@%GoGoLoThirty> NaCl is just NaCl. BUT there are plenty of other minerals you can get in various salts. for example, iodized salt is important for some ppl, especially vegans, because lots of diets are missing it

[2023-01-02 22:51:50] <%SearingDarkness> @kagens One of the minion mods is that they ignore your phys reduction
