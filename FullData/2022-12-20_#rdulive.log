[2022-12-20 12:36:30] <@%R2DU> HmmmG Kripp is only 7k mmr but he is far ahead of Rdu in critical thinking and analyzing the playing field, Kripp is always 5 steps ahead and is allready considering what minions to buy in tavern tier 6 while only at turn 2. wheras Rdu is only looking at the battlefield in front of him. i firmly believe Rdu should leave his bg carreer and focus on his cooking.

[2022-12-20 12:53:26] <mix12324> Poison murloc went to 6 tier instead of 4. They removed Mechanotank and Whitemane. They added back 4 minions: Dude with avenge that adds battlecry cards to hand, dude that makes murloc golden, dude that grows with menagerie and the mehano-egg. Those are the changes.

[2022-12-20 13:02:23] <+benleon1> hello @RduLIVE, a few days ago you mentioned toxfin should be tier 5 to make it more balanced...what are your thoughts on making in tier 6? did they nerf it too much?

[2022-12-20 14:18:23] <dugongo_saccente> @R2DU No thanks, I don't want to give money to Kripp Kappa
[2022-12-20 14:18:24] <@%R2DU> HmmmG Kripp is only 7k mmr but he is far ahead of Rdu in critical thinking and analyzing the playing field, Kripp is always 5 steps ahead and is allready considering what minions to buy in tavern tier 6 while only at turn 2. wheras Rdu is only looking at the battlefield in front of him. i firmly believe Rdu should leave his bg carreer and focus on his cooking.

[2022-12-20 15:24:25] <@%R2DU> HmmmG Kripp is only 7k mmr but he is far ahead of Rdu in critical thinking and analyzing the playing field, Kripp is always 5 steps ahead and is allready considering what minions to buy in tavern tier 6 while only at turn 2. wheras Rdu is only looking at the battlefield in front of him. i firmly believe Rdu should leave his bg carreer and focus on his cooking.

[2022-12-20 17:41:29] <Srynan> In german we have a lot of very well dubbed movies. What can be irritatign is, if an actor/actress has done a very memorable character and you hear their voice again in a completely different movie ^^
[2022-12-20 17:41:30] <+dazzchy> just kidding
[2022-12-20 17:41:32] <+umMendes> Brazilian voice actors are amazing, but it depends

[2022-12-20 17:41:37] <%+ilmandi> yes we have a nice actor's accademy for dubbing, and we are stupid, we know only italian
[2022-12-20 17:41:38] <dugongo_saccente> Yeah they are, and our english is overall very poor

[2022-12-20 17:41:58] <+SendMutes> german subs for big productions are good but i rather watch them in the original language anyway

[2022-12-20 17:41:59] <+Element_25> it's not that italians can't read, it's that written words can't move their hands while talking!
[2022-12-20 17:42:03] <+gilegendary> mech
[2022-12-20 17:42:03] <goldegolem> My country of Brazil has a huge dubbing industry that is actually pretty good so only some movies are in their original languages and you always have the toption to watch it dubbed @RduLIVE
[2022-12-20 17:42:04] <+fry773> Keanu Reeve's voice over in German actually better than original
[2022-12-20 17:42:06] <Rasteej_TV> in Czechia we have dub for everything and its pretty good, but I still think the dub will never be the way the director intended for it to be
[2022-12-20 17:42:15] <%terje439> I remember a story from the 90s, the pope had invited the man who played in the German detective series "Derrick" to an audience. When he arrived the pope thought he was fake cause his voice was different from what the pope had seen on TV LUL

Are we all just monkey see monkey do? I don't know about you guys but I'm sick of every time I look up a game, or a forum post, anything really I have to scroll past like 50 of these.

[2022-12-20 20:23:05] <@%R2DU> HmmmG Kripp is only 7k mmr but he is far ahead of Rdu in critical thinking and analyzing the playing field, Kripp is always 5 steps ahead and is allready considering what minions to buy in tavern tier 6 while only at turn 2. wheras Rdu is only looking at the battlefield in front of him. i firmly believe Rdu should leave his bg carreer and focus on his cooking.

[2022-12-20 20:56:39] <@%R2DU> HmmmG Kripp is only 7k mmr but he is far ahead of Rdu in critical thinking and analyzing the playing field, Kripp is always 5 steps ahead and is allready considering what minions to buy in tavern tier 6 while only at turn 2. wheras Rdu is only looking at the battlefield in front of him. i firmly believe Rdu should leave his bg carreer and focus on his cooking.
