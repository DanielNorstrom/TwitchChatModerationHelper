[2022-12-17 09:18:28] <%+sin_pyro> Speaking of Violet, I've been playing so much IronMON, that when my Froslass was "loafing around" in battle, my brain instantly thought it somehow got Truant instead of it just being too high level for me to command LUL
[2022-12-17 09:18:28] <Wangfou> Seems servicible

[2022-12-17 09:26:13] <scorpaenop> and it makes u vulnerable to whirlwind or something like that
[2022-12-17 09:26:23] <@%Iceblue> water moves are special in this gen
[2022-12-17 09:26:23] <%$Kailaria> nah, stab poison would be best

[2022-12-17 09:26:36] <+stellarsophia0> so wing attack and sludge bomb are optimal here

[2022-12-17 10:43:41] <@%^Nightbot> To promote a healthy community and chat environment for both other viewers and myself as a streamer, I have several words that are blocked from chat (rip, oof, reset, and a few others), and also prefer that you don't use F when I die or fail something in a run as I could not filter the single letter. If you try to send a message with one of these words, you will get an error message. I also purge pepe and pepe-related emotes. I hope you understand, and thank you for watching!
