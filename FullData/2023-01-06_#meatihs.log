[2023-01-06 22:30:37] [Points] BlooduR redeemed Medical Advice (10 000) [A serious question. I woke up today around 9:30 feeling dizzy (stronger dizziness than usual 'get up' dizzy). I though its just dehydration so i drank water immediatly. Nothing changed. That lasted until 16:00. One thing i noticed is that it got worse while laying and better when i had my head straight up. My question is could it last so long from dehydration or could it be related to stress(upcoming exams)? Thanks]

[2023-01-06 23:30:45] <+BillyGoatBuff> dh just needs the quest nerfed cause i have it in golden Kappa
[2023-01-06 23:31:07] <+honawee> according to VS, DH is only viable because it's a decent matchup against Rogue. It might not need a nerf if Rogue gets nerfed, as it'll start to play against worse matchups

[2023-01-06 23:32:32] <+datfrogger> @honawee This keeps Quest DH at a near Tier 1 level, but it’s obviously warping the format in an undesired way.
[2023-01-06 23:32:38] <+datfrogger> thats what vS said
[2023-01-06 23:32:46] <+datfrogger> even if its not tier 1 winrate it warps the meta

[2023-01-06 23:33:12] <+honawee> quest DH will not be as oppressive in a slower meta with more heal + control options
[2023-01-06 23:33:40] <+datfrogger> we arent gonna be in some slower heal/control meta even if they nerf rogue, we just go to minelock and win on turn 7 instead of turn 6
[2023-01-06 23:33:49] <%Red_Rum_> they nerfed and unnerfed gnoll, they wont do it again i think. They`ll nerf something else
[2023-01-06 23:34:01] <%chasaaaaam> What is feno holding in his hands???
[2023-01-06 23:34:03] <ambdoexious> how will the meta shape if they nerf rogue?
[2023-01-06 23:34:05] <ironylad> i bet they nerf shadowtep
[2023-01-06 23:34:06] <+honawee> @datfrogger yeah minelock will need to get nerfed too tbh, or it's going to become oppressive. it's the fastest "infinite damage" combo deck
[2023-01-06 23:34:07] <%Vengeance_88> Minelock stonks will rise after the patch
[2023-01-06 23:34:09] <%+MossyMouth> Coc needed to be slimier

[2023-01-06 23:44:43] <Takkon> I'm sad that potion belt probably gets nerfed.  Its by far the best way to play coc's.
[2023-01-06 23:44:45] <Azerothic_> WeirdDude
[2023-01-06 23:44:48] <+BillyGoatBuff> just queue into me and youll have belt on 2 every game FeelsBadMan
[2023-01-06 23:44:53] <abinadec> which bundle should i buy to be competetive ?

[2023-01-06 23:45:18] <+reaperonetho> i was losing some games because bad rng (ofc) so i just stop being unlucky
[2023-01-06 23:45:18] <Takkon> I agree on gnoll, but I think gnoll isn't enough.
[2023-01-06 23:45:30] <sapnciap> BOOBA
[2023-01-06 23:45:40] <+datfrogger> @abinadec buy the minisets for sunken city and castle nathria
[2023-01-06 23:45:42] <+honawee> if you drew location would you ever hold the 0 mana totem? not worth right?
[2023-01-06 23:45:45] <%Vengeance_88> Will gnoll rotate on april
[2023-01-06 23:45:47] <+sarcastic100> nerf rogue again
[2023-01-06 23:45:48] <rochop> The gnoll interaction should'nt count any cards you get as you're revealed, I feel like that would kill the degeneracy (and maybe the card)
[2023-01-06 23:45:53] <+sarcastic100> really ?
[2023-01-06 23:45:56] <nikke35_> hunters always win if rogue doesnt gnoll em

[2023-01-06 23:46:02] <+honawee> @rochop definitely kills the card
[2023-01-06 23:46:38] <%Ganbare_Gaijin> The song is a whole mood
[2023-01-06 23:46:42] <+honawee> not saying killing gnoll is a bad thing... pretty tired of its oppression after like 2 years
[2023-01-06 23:46:43] <leroyj3nkinss> everyday rogue
[2023-01-06 23:46:45] <Apock13> you play maestra and onto next game ;D

[2023-01-06 23:49:13] <+datfrogger> his hand was trash
[2023-01-06 23:49:41] <+datfrogger> i was thinking ghostly strikes on turn 4 instead of astalor though
[2023-01-06 23:49:48] <+datfrogger> to get the ghostly strike card draw done with

[2023-01-06 23:53:43] <+honawee> i'd use step on the 4/4 to heal it and get +2/2
[2023-01-06 23:54:36] <+datfrogger> 3 drop is stealth

[2023-01-06 23:57:32] <%GameOn__> how did u study if reading was a requirement? was it tough
[2023-01-06 23:57:34] <nikke35_> ???????????
[2023-01-06 23:57:40] <abuy69> we play hearthstone, we cant read Kapp
[2023-01-06 23:57:48] <@%$Raptorheart> We need to talk to Feno about the amount of beers he's kicking back
[2023-01-06 23:57:48] <+snaktray> you prolly need to read to keep up right?
[2023-01-06 23:57:53] <sonofman1930> Reading helps you understand you can't just go in blind.
[2023-01-06 23:57:57] <leroyj3nkinss> reading is good to improve and mediate
[2023-01-06 23:57:58] <!Thomerio> reading cards is the hardest
