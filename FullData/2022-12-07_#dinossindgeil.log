[2022-12-07 17:33:01] You have joined #dinossindgeil
[2022-12-07 17:33:08] <%AsherCanid> Yes
[2022-12-07 17:33:15] <+ZiggsSawPuzzle> to set up her dodge algo?
[2022-12-07 17:33:16] <%+croacx> not sure if she dodges it
[2022-12-07 17:33:26] <%LordSpankworthy> It's hard to stagger her with it
[2022-12-07 17:33:29] <%+remiri> i used lions claw on her
[2022-12-07 17:33:31] <%LordSpankworthy> Because of the cast time
[2022-12-07 17:33:33] <%$originalgengar> @Gosfi i'm not very well versed but it seems like everyone can just put in an appeal to ban books out of school in canada? I see both the bible and harry potter on a list of challenged books LUL
[2022-12-07 17:33:37] <+ZiggsSawPuzzle> she dodges a lot of magic
[2022-12-07 17:33:38] <%AsherCanid> Helps build up poise at least
[2022-12-07 17:33:43] <%LordSpankworthy> And her poise recovers really fast
[2022-12-07 17:33:46] <+ZiggsSawPuzzle> but she wouldnt dodge the dalayed ones
[2022-12-07 17:33:48] <%$originalgengar> *well versed in canada law
[2022-12-07 17:34:04] <%+croacx> im for all-in elden ring
[2022-12-07 17:34:07] <%+Soad3821> follow your lizard heart
[2022-12-07 17:34:14] <%bartyboyk> I'd like ds3
[2022-12-07 17:34:14] <+SharknadeauStreams> I'm enjoying watching elden ring at the moment, but watching some soulsage is fun too
[2022-12-07 17:34:14] <%$ToStrife> just getting in, hello all, were daggers buffed?
[2022-12-07 17:34:14] <+ZiggsSawPuzzle> back and forth maybe?

[2022-12-07 17:34:20] <%$Khaas_> @dinossindgeil try moving around with games and see how it feels and how your numbers change
[2022-12-07 17:34:23] <+Gandolph> pepeLaugh
[2022-12-07 17:34:24] <%+remiri> i like ER and i think you are very close
[2022-12-07 17:34:30] <+Gandolph> Hello Nico LuvSign
[2022-12-07 17:34:36] <+juicybrick> why did we swap radagon to the last boss?
[2022-12-07 17:34:39] <+Gandolph> I'd say full on ER
[2022-12-07 17:34:40] <%$Khaas_> You can always go back to ER only if it's not good for you
[2022-12-07 17:34:41] <%meinMestar> gandork peepoWave
[2022-12-07 17:34:45] <%meinMestar> limmyPoint
[2022-12-07 17:34:46] <%bartyboyk> I just started DS3 and I'm loving it
[2022-12-07 17:34:51] <brokenxcx> Hello human
[2022-12-07 17:34:52] <+Gandolph> meinMestar peepoWave
[2022-12-07 17:34:53] <%$ToStrife> did daggers get a buff in 1.08?
[2022-12-07 17:34:59] <%foxxx0> why don't just play two games simultaneously?
[2022-12-07 17:34:59] <%CableSeadreamer> @originalgengar when you think about it harry potter and the bible are both about young men with magical powers and the trials and tribulations of their life
[2022-12-07 17:35:00] <+Gandolph> bartyboyk Enjoy Pog
[2022-12-07 17:35:09] <%bartyboyk> ty
[2022-12-07 17:35:13] <ToxicKron76> A stream with half ER and half DS
[2022-12-07 17:35:14] <%AThreeFootGiant> Big patch today?
[2022-12-07 17:35:18] <%$Khaas_> You and the audience get both get burned out of playing a single game
[2022-12-07 17:35:24] <%$LeeJamz> Warzone hitless?
[2022-12-07 17:35:28] <%$Khaas_> can*
[2022-12-07 17:35:33] <brokenxcx> Hello chat
[2022-12-07 17:35:41] <+SharknadeauStreams> That's good, that means the DLC won't be just coliseums
[2022-12-07 17:35:53] <%$LeeJamz> Warzone 2 is pretty new so makes sense
[2022-12-07 17:35:53] <+Gandolph> Yes, but we watch Hob for the warzone pain, not his skill KEKWTF
[2022-12-07 17:36:05] <%BanjoTheUncle> He gets very angry sometimes :(
[2022-12-07 17:36:09] <CheesyM1ke> Well, he mostly gets frustrated playing
[2022-12-07 17:36:16] <%+xSpoonman> Hob's rage moments are pretty awesome too
[2022-12-07 17:36:26] <%+Gosfi> @Gosfi well, what happens is that the parents can make an appeal to what books are deemed "bannable" so the schools can either put a note saying the book touches sensitive subjects or just outright ban them, the schools also do a check of their library every year and they decide whether or not they ban them
[2022-12-07 17:36:34] <%mbx220> he clowns a lot it's entertaining
[2022-12-07 17:36:38] <%mbx220> but I miss GR3
[2022-12-07 17:36:39] <+Gandolph> Aye. There's likely some incredibly skilled people out there who would be dull to watch if they have no personality.
[2022-12-07 17:36:53] <+ZiggsSawPuzzle> PoroSad
[2022-12-07 17:36:59] <%AThreeFootGiant> Oh I see the colosseum is a pvp arena
[2022-12-07 17:36:59] <+JoeInNeed> you're not Mr Bean-y enough
[2022-12-07 17:37:05] <%mbx220> Sadge
[2022-12-07 17:37:05] <%+unagiro> how is the run going so far nico?
[2022-12-07 17:37:08] <+juicybrick> i thought we already did the duo today?
[2022-12-07 17:37:14] <%+AndyDale93> Warzone is tough to get better at as well because of the skill based matchmaking putting you against tougher competition.
