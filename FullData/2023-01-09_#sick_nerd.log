[2023-01-09 13:04:41] <@Tyokath> osrs skill def won't be a combination of rs3 skills
[2023-01-09 13:04:44] <@%AriSlash> i think the opposite, i think its probably going to be absolute dogshit
[2023-01-09 13:04:47] <@%AriSlash> but ill get 99 anyway
[2023-01-09 13:04:50] <EshayNemo> Pog new skill, will give me something to do

[2023-01-09 13:05:09] <%+AleonSC> im genuinely surprised the osrs community is mature enough to handle a new skill being added
[2023-01-09 13:05:14] <ImMatRS> @Sick_Nerd What about a new league? Love watching your league streams
[2023-01-09 13:05:26] <%+DvDPlayerDuder> @AriSlash wdym, I look forward to Slayer 2
[2023-01-09 13:05:26] <@Tyokath> I'll try the skill if it offers unique content, if it's a rs3 rehash like 90% off the updates no thanks
[2023-01-09 13:05:30] <@%AriSlash> diesofCringe
[2023-01-09 13:05:39] <ice_cloud_but_again> I think the new osrs skill will be good. but it's a damn shame the polling and "reee jagex game devs can't dev a game" will make it take 4 business years to make

[2023-01-09 15:50:50] <%SolasR6> current thing bad
[2023-01-09 15:50:51] <%+ShayHay> thats because they are farmed more heavily now

[2023-01-09 15:50:56] <+Raw_Potato> avacados are really expensive in the USA
[2023-01-09 15:50:58] VIEWERS: 681
[2023-01-09 15:51:04] <Hax_Muffins> £2 for a bag on 'wonky' avocado's from Morrisons and you get like 6-8 of them
[2023-01-09 15:51:05] <$RancherRancher> Avacadoes here are like $3 each
[2023-01-09 15:51:06] <+Rickers12> Tescos = 79p for large on clubcard.

[2023-01-09 15:51:18] <thebigzun> thank god there is no sugar in fruits
[2023-01-09 15:51:19] <%BrockDaSock> avocados are fruits x0r6ztGiggle

[2023-01-09 15:51:39] <BambooShoots> I stopped going to Starbucks and eating avacado toast and now I own a Ferrari EZ
[2023-01-09 15:51:44] <@AriSlash> avocado + chicken is so fucking good
[2023-01-09 15:51:49] <@$FineBeef> half the weight of them is the huge stone inside them though
[2023-01-09 15:51:53] <Peanut49> i think you can wash the infected hand
[2023-01-09 15:51:53] <@AriSlash> u could probably pour dr pepper over it and it wouldnt be ruined cuz its that good
[2023-01-09 15:51:54] <scrumptulous> i would definitely spend my life savings on a single avocado
[2023-01-09 15:51:56] <Peanut49> before re-wrapping it
[2023-01-09 15:52:04] <%SolasR6> i didn't buy avocado last week now i can afford a house
[2023-01-09 15:52:05] <%R0W2> its a shame avocados are terrible to grow, they use too many resources

[2023-01-09 17:27:29] <SpeakEngIish> cities have crime, polluted air, noise...
[2023-01-09 17:27:29] <Peanut49> 20k and they call it a city?
[2023-01-09 17:27:35] <%GGeasyL2p> So you're moving to kopenhagen then LUL
[2023-01-09 17:27:40] <Broon89> Oh damn, I'm only 4k
[2023-01-09 17:27:43] <ThatLatvianGuy> the capital city here has 1/3rd of our population
[2023-01-09 17:27:46] <@%$Tinkelsia> @Dorullmisbruker lolololol
[2023-01-09 17:27:49] <%SolasR6> YES
[2023-01-09 17:27:50] <%SolasR6> yes
[2023-01-09 17:27:55] <Peanut49> thats my understanding of how it works in the UK but they give out city status to anywhere now
[2023-01-09 17:27:59] <Javentador> I think youre thinking of Hamlets vs villages ?
[2023-01-09 17:28:01] <%SolasR6> in ENGLAND
[2023-01-09 17:28:01] <midtiercabbage> ngl 20k is a decent sized city in denmark
[2023-01-09 17:28:02] <+Fenthule> I think half a mill is nice. its big enough to be alive but not small enough where you know everyone's else by name lol
[2023-01-09 17:28:14] <+Tramfix> In the Netherlands you are a town with a church and a city if you got city rights I believe
[2023-01-09 17:28:18] <met_formin> cities have a population of at least 50k
[2023-01-09 17:28:24] <Peanut49> also true
[2023-01-09 17:28:30] <Peanut49> low pop and low density
[2023-01-09 17:28:31] <Izzu__> Denmark is like you live in Köpenhamn or in a small place

[2023-01-09 17:30:42] <$cgoldsmith95> apparently back in the 19th century having a cathedral was a requirement for city status, but that is no longer the case (in the UK)

[2023-01-09 17:57:42] <%+DvDPlayerDuder> Cheer100 So 4 years ago I was in France. It was around lunchtime, and I had been driving for a few hours, so we stopped at the first Fast Food place we encountered, it being a Burger King. We discussed what we were going to order, and my GF went queuing, and I went to the bathroom. For some reason this massive Burger King had like 2 shared bathroom stalls. It was weird, but okay. The weird thing about this bathrooms was that they where open. So the top of the door was like completely open.
[2023-01-09 17:57:55] <Low_Timez> i either cant find cigs or lighter/matches most of the time lol
[2023-01-09 17:58:03] <@Tyokath> I know where this is going

[2023-01-09 17:58:04] <%$DvDPlayerDuder> Cheer100 I thought I had to take a piss, but when I sat on the toilet, my bowels just opened. I started violently and extremely loudly shitting. It was fucking awful. It kept coming, and the sounds and the smells where so, so so bad. It took like 5 minutes to empty everything out. I wiped. I stepped out. And I saw like 6 people waiting. Horrified by what happened in that stall. We made eye contact. I washed my hands. Walked out, told my GF i was waiting in the car and ran out.
