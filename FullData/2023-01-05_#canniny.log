[2023-01-05 00:05:29] <%$herr__u> Those ear-mics were originally to realistically capture how sound is heard by a human (very useful in some audio fields)... then the twitch-people got a hold of it
[2023-01-05 00:05:42] <%jmm548> two mics built into the head thing

[2023-01-05 00:33:43] <%$morris_FL> the cutting and scar stuff is probably part of the kink
[2023-01-05 00:33:51] <%$mister_mokkapala> Or if they have medical knowledge they can just do the same thing as they do when you give a blood sample
