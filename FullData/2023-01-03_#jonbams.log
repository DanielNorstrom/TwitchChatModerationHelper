It is concerning because over millions of miles this could create huge natural changes.  They have found an anomaly recently in the mass of the earth which is pin pointed to the Buffalo or Rochester area with a decrease in mass which is causing the problem
[2023-01-03 16:33:06] <%Mackapoot> @JonBams  Wyoming has two escalators. Repeating: In its 97,914 square miles, the state of Wyoming only has two escalators (four if you factor in that each has an up and a down)

[2023-01-03 16:45:24] <%NightWolf070> Cheer200 True statistic, but that sounds a lot like that, "More people are killed by toasters than sharks", statistic. Whilst it's true, that toasters and deer are more dangerous, you're only going to get killed by a toaster if you're a through and through total moron. Whereas a shark will just eat you if you smell nice. Yaknow what I mean

[2023-01-03 18:00:44] <%$vincesola> Cheer200 I disagree. A defense attorney's job is to get their client off for crimes they have committed. That's fine and acceptable. But if they lie, destroy evidence or cross the line you don't say well that's their job. There are boundaries and rules. And in a sports commentator roles, he has toed that line for a long time. Just my opinion. And most importantly / / / I respect yours as well.

[2023-01-03 18:43:24] <%Thedarkvet53> Cheer100 Cheer100 Jon, I would argue you have a significant confirmation bias.  I have paid you almost 400 subs to watch movies not in the horror genre which you all loved.  You claim all the best movies are in the horror genre but 80 percent of the movies you watch are horror so that constitutes confirmation bias
