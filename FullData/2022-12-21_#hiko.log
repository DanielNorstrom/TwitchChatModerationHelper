[2022-12-21 16:25:40] <+Austizzlin> @sswolfking465 you cannot get into cave on A in that time. Regardless the rotate is just way too long. CT can hold all chokes and rotate in half the time. The point of a good map is that it is relatively balanced on both sides.

[2022-12-21 18:29:59] <+xocla> any*

[2022-12-21 18:31:09] <+br1kxy> Here!
[2022-12-21 18:31:29] <gjoi777> With replay system they can add an option with sending proof when you report accounts, there are many ways they can deal with boosted players, trolls or smurfs
[2022-12-21 18:31:34] <grouchyVAL> @Riftseaker yeah but theres like 2% of people that would vod review so its not really priority
[2022-12-21 18:31:43] <%+laxnash> They are adding more smurf detection and they promise that the smurf account will get placed in the rank it belongs within 4-10 games

[2022-12-21 18:32:58] <%+laxnash> They would have to work hard to reverse boost and then 4-10 games of actually playing they have to reverse boost again

[2022-12-21 20:58:45] <@%Eurazn> pogg free to play
[2022-12-21 20:58:48] <handsomebulge> Once you get addicted to overwatxh you can‚Äôt go back to valorant. Valorant is way too slow @hiko
[2022-12-21 20:58:55] <+Nomikenz> We love free to play
[2022-12-21 20:58:56] <+giornocannoli> he‚Äôs dookie
[2022-12-21 20:59:01] <itzcookiebtw> I would always recommend overwatch. Or at least giving it a try if you have never played it.
[2022-12-21 20:59:03] <%+katherineobvious77> Overwatch will help with gamesense which a lot of valorant players need to learn
[2022-12-21 20:59:03] <im_kashi> overwatch is fun for sure
