[2022-12-26 13:06:45] <@ZHBot>* Standard blackjack rules, with the exception of a re-roll if the Streamer rolls the same number as you. 10, 11, 12, 13 = 10 (10, Jack, Queen & King). 1 = Ace (1 or 11 down to choice). If you roll over 21 you lose, same to the streamer.

[2022-12-26 13:54:00] <@ZHBot>* Standard blackjack rules, with the exception of a re-roll if the Streamer rolls the same number as you. 10, 11, 12, 13 = 10 (10, Jack, Queen & King). 1 = Ace (1 or 11 down to choice). If you roll over 21 you lose, same to the streamer.

[2022-12-26 16:07:32] <jorenator_> !roulette
[2022-12-26 16:07:32] <@ZHBot>* Standard blackjack rules, with the exception of a re-roll if the Streamer rolls the same number as you. 10, 11, 12, 13 = 10 (10, Jack, Queen & King). 1 = Ace (1 or 11 down to choice). If you roll over 21 you lose, same to the streamer.
