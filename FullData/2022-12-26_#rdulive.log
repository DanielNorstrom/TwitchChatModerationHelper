[2022-12-26 15:37:01] <@%R2DU> HmmmG Kripp is only 7k mmr but he is far ahead of Rdu in critical thinking and analyzing the playing field, Kripp is always 5 steps ahead and is allready considering what minions to buy in tavern tier 6 while only at turn 2. wheras Rdu is only looking at the battlefield in front of him. i firmly believe Rdu should leave his bg carreer and focus on his cooking.

[2022-12-26 20:06:13] <user1482> doesn't taunting make you weaker before you have any other strong unit, now the buff will go to something weak?

[2022-12-26 20:08:02] <user1482> @Rshig without taunt, both the strong ones will likely live the longest, so one will buff the other. With taunt it's more likely the buffs go to some weak unit without damage, no?

[2022-12-26 21:35:18] <%Fo1wS> No. You kick at the ball, you shoot the ball
[2022-12-26 21:35:19] <RNJesus007> just imagine 22 people shooting at a ball
[2022-12-26 21:35:25] <wondrous_wisdomball> I can confirm if Football players were shooting the ball then Americans would be good at it
[2022-12-26 21:35:28] <Pavis11> As an American, shoot is 100% the correct term.
[2022-12-26 21:35:34] <@%RedNote_EZ> @Weirdgus they actually say that

[2022-12-26 21:37:06] <%+SerpentaeK> @greatmemesonly I think probably because queen can get divine shield and may be able to kill 2x the amount, whereas as soon as leeroy dies, he has nothing left to kill
