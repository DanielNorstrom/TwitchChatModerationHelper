[2022-12-10 12:57:12] <%paddy988> @BreaK he should have had a first yellow for the tackle, and then a second for kicking the ball into the bench imo
[2022-12-10 12:57:14] <+KojakLivesOn> Referee totally lost control of that game.

[2022-12-10 13:45:44] <%Mithalder> Nah.  He was head down and run at Liverpool.  Could see the talent was there, just rarely unleashed it
[2022-12-10 13:45:45] <%Cartster> his work rate was better, had to be due to Suarez
[2022-12-10 13:45:58] <%Cartster> even Sturridge worked hard then
[2022-12-10 13:46:21] <%ZCrimes> that's another blast from the past, Sturridge, what happened to him?
[2022-12-10 13:46:23] <comr8d> @zcrimes He used the “know ball” in a football argument of course its a weird comment

[2022-12-10 13:52:08] <comr8d> Watford’s trials used to be a nightmare
[2022-12-10 13:52:10] <%Cartster> thats not the norm
[2022-12-10 13:52:19] <Hobbitlife> I legit cant watch football bc of all the blatant fishing for cards... throwing them selves on the ground etc.... why is that allowed?
[2022-12-10 13:52:23] <comr8d> They would take like 40 thousands kids a year in trial
[2022-12-10 13:52:39] <frankoh100> rip
[2022-12-10 13:52:56] <%GoatRa> I saw Johan Djourou outside a Firkin once, about as close to a football trial I got.

[2022-12-10 13:54:20] <comr8d> Yeah it’s more mad that people who are worse then dele alli still get transfers around the top flights because they didn’t run into a mourinho style manager in their career, or have better agents

[2022-12-10 13:56:16] <%Cartster> true
[2022-12-10 13:56:17] <%+Zuqar> wonder if they'll do drops as soon as they wipe like they've done previously
[2022-12-10 13:56:21] <%AkimboRy> This time they have reworked quests and apparently you need books and etc now

[2022-12-10 15:07:50] <%Cartster> check she's not a scammer & yeah
[2022-12-10 15:07:58] <%LiamG> you should give to your local foodbank imo
[2022-12-10 15:07:59] <%+Blast_67> Check it out 1st and do it.
[2022-12-10 15:08:00] <+Goonie4Ever> not cash...

[2022-12-10 15:09:05] <wiggie2gone> 500 in cash has expectations attached to it.  Gift cards is pretty much no hints attached
[2022-12-10 15:09:07] <%+Fotherby> That´s why vouchers are better as they are not ´capital´

[2022-12-10 15:09:21] <+theinvisiblemuffin> why dont you take her to the super market and get her to shop foir food then pay for it ?
[2022-12-10 15:09:22] <%LiamG> this chat is way too trusting
[2022-12-10 15:09:27] <%GamerGirl07TV> The best charity is paying your taxes and not avoiding them like some big companies do Prayge
[2022-12-10 15:09:45] <%LiamG> just let your local foodbank handle everything
[2022-12-10 15:09:51] <%Bolf> cash feels creepy , grocery cards are a bit more pay it forwardy
[2022-12-10 15:09:53] <Bread_3_> a foodbank might make the money go further?
[2022-12-10 15:09:55] <Bread_3_> idk
[2022-12-10 15:09:58] <%LiamG> yeh but it's their job to handle it, and make sure it goes to who really need it
[2022-12-10 15:10:11] <+Goonie4Ever> she could go to foodbank...and money that way wouod support more families
[2022-12-10 15:10:16] <%+I_Dabble_In_Finagling> I agree with Liam
[2022-12-10 15:10:26] <%Cartster> @BreaK any mutual friends?
[2022-12-10 15:10:29] <wiggie2gone> @BreaK  had a lady on the nextdoor app ask about helping with  some stuff for Christmas and I grabbed her some stuff off the amazon list. So feel good about what ever you choose
[2022-12-10 15:10:36] <BrotherHovis> local foodbanks run by volunteers (non-paid or minimum wage) is the way forward
[2022-12-10 15:10:53] <+Goonie4Ever> a week?!!?
[2022-12-10 15:10:53] <%Ed_1878> I don't agree with LiamG, way ro cyncical this chat
[2022-12-10 15:10:53] <%LiamG> yeh but your foodbank will be for people in your local area

[2022-12-10 15:11:24] <+Goonie4Ever> goes further at a foodbank

[2022-12-10 15:11:29] <+Goonie4Ever> what if she smokes!!

[2022-12-10 15:11:35] <cybermyk> I knew a guy in Liverpool in the 70's was sat near St Johns with a card and a dog earning £100 plus a day.
[2022-12-10 15:11:44] <%nick_mitsh1> i spend about £150 a week on two of us and I shop at ALdi and Morrisons
[2022-12-10 15:11:57] <%nick_mitsh1> Though I'm also an alcoholic :D
[2022-12-10 15:11:57] <%Sgt__Z> The fact that you even thought to do it = stand up guy.
[2022-12-10 15:11:57] <%LiamG> it would. but imagine if you helped 10 families with it instead
[2022-12-10 15:12:16] <p_i_g_e_o_n> can you reach out to one of her friends on social media to verify it's legit?
[2022-12-10 15:12:16] <+Olgit> It's nice to be kind, but be careful.  It might be nice to do a food parcel, then a small amount in cash to cover basics, bread, milk, etc.
[2022-12-10 15:12:19] <%LiamG> just good "foodbank <town>"
[2022-12-10 15:12:25] <%LiamG> i bet there's a very local one
[2022-12-10 15:12:28] <%LiamG> google, even
[2022-12-10 15:12:33] <+Goonie4Ever> 500 to a complete stranger via social media ..... i wouldnt
[2022-12-10 15:12:37] <%Ed_1878> actually now i agree with Liam and chat....foodbank
[2022-12-10 15:12:38] <zenFX_> @nick_mitsh1 i shop at same places yet spend £500 on two people in 6 weeks, how much alcohol do you buy lmao
[2022-12-10 15:12:41] <BrotherHovis> @LiamG yup definitely the way to do it
[2022-12-10 15:12:58] <BeerCanSandwich> @LiamG Saldy it's not all about food. It's general expenses which aren't provided by food banks. Gas and electricity for starters..
[2022-12-10 15:13:02] <+Goonie4Ever> Then go to foodbank
[2022-12-10 15:13:11] <wiggie2gone> walk up to her house and hand deliver it
[2022-12-10 15:13:15] <+Goonie4Ever> where actual people struggling go
[2022-12-10 15:13:21] <%+I_Dabble_In_Finagling> It's social media you have absolutely no idea
[2022-12-10 15:13:24] <%+Arkonios_> but in a local foodbank you could make 100 peoples Xmas Break
[2022-12-10 15:13:25] <%nick_mitsh1> @zenFX_ enough to make watching break accpetable

[2022-12-10 15:13:55] <BrotherHovis> foodbanks can use the money to bulkbuy and help lots of families
[2022-12-10 15:14:04] <%nick_mitsh1> break is the dad @cybermyk hence the guilt ;)

[2022-12-10 15:14:25] <%Ed_1878> I struggle at times....I wouldn't go to a foodbank at it means talking to people i just miss meals. But I live alone
[2022-12-10 15:14:35] <+Goonie4Ever> I think it's a risk via social

[2022-12-10 15:19:41] <%LiamG> food banks can give energy credits now too
[2022-12-10 15:19:49] <%LiamG> so you can help people stay warm in the snow if you just give it to them

[2022-12-10 15:59:18] <%muggins210188> QTCinderlla said this about TSM: She explained that TSM didn’t support or congratulate her when she created and co-hosted the Streamer Awards in 2022. This was allegedly a pattern whenever the streamer would come up with content ideas for the entire organization, which ultimately led to her decision to not re-sign, adding that she wanted a team that would support her.
