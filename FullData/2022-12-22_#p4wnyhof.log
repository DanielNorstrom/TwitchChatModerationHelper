[2022-12-22 10:51:13] <%Grim08a> So my new 7900 XTX is not performing as expected in MW2/Warzone. Weird thing is that when I run the benchmark test I have pretty high avg FPS, I am thinking if there is some weird setting somewhere. Also a mistake I probably made is that I did not let it reset my settings when I slotted in the new GPU. Don't know if I can reset it somehow afterwards?

[2022-12-22 10:51:27] <+Atrionix> Oh have you tried undervolting your GPU? I heard IcemanIsaac talk about it and I think he hasn't crashed since

[2022-12-22 10:51:32] <%superhiman88> Stylerz settings helped me, he made a Video on that

[2022-12-22 10:51:41] <%Kdlahh> even in MP
[2022-12-22 10:51:46] <%Burkielol> have you tried the game on steam?
[2022-12-22 10:51:49] <%superhiman88> He has an amd gpu as well
[2022-12-22 10:51:51] <%+Xantios> and the crashes doesnt make sense at all NotLikeThis
[2022-12-22 10:51:59] <circuit_breaker__> does the game generate some kind of crash reports?
[2022-12-22 10:52:11] <%LordOverflow> Feels like cache gets full so that's why restarting game after each match might "fix it" unless you have really long match
[2022-12-22 10:52:49] <Ellevix> Ok, entertain me... You are running AMD yeh. Check if you have FCLK frequency set in the bios. If so reduce it by 33mhz if not then set it to a fixed mhz, generally 1/2 of your memory speed.
[2022-12-22 10:52:58] <%Grim08a> When is your 7900 XT card coming? :)

[2022-12-22 10:53:32] <%LordOverflow> Well then you need to turn the crashes into content ;) "Video about State of Crashzone 2! Please FIX IT!"
[2022-12-22 10:53:52] <%Kdlahh> every other game runs fine, thats just cod things
[2022-12-22 10:54:02] <Ellevix> or try IceMan settings
[2022-12-22 10:54:07] <lbl4ckf1rel> @P4wnyhof Moin, were you the Lobby lead? My friend and i have the theory that the one that has been invited to warzone gets connection lost to his teammate

[2022-12-22 11:07:50] <%+beardflix> hmm I can't understand why it's crashing. I didn't had a single crash in warzone. that's so strange.

[2022-12-22 11:09:08] <%LordOverflow> in worst case it's something in outer space that cause the crash and that's not even a joke :D
[2022-12-22 11:09:10] <+NoBlack18> @Burkielol I might in the future, it cant be the right way of Twitch though to force me to subscribe to someone I´ve barely watched for 30mins at this point. Its really hard to watch a streamer who´s toggling Ads, missing 2+ Minutes every now and then. Really bothers me, as Twitch is following the concept of linear TV, however, even on the TV you wont miss any content. Best example: Straight up missed Pawny responding to my chat message talking about ads. It just sucks
[2022-12-22 11:09:13] <+LudaLuke> ask primen how much I crash now
[2022-12-22 11:09:17] <%+beardflix> I hope you will be able to fix this and play normally 😊

[2022-12-22 11:18:47] <%LordOverflow> Only way to fix it is not to play it but yeah that's not really a solution :D
[2022-12-22 11:19:01] <Ellevix> You've tried everything else, may as well try the FCLK frequency, if it doesn't work just change it back :)  I know it sounds unrelated but I use to play a heap of Rebirth, it would crash constantly, but no other game would crash, until I dropped the FCLK clock slightly

[2022-12-22 11:22:29] <%Grim08a> @P4wnyhof I think you might have weapon motion blur switched off, if you switch it on you might get rid of that freeze and the lag you had in the plane intro scene.
[2022-12-22 11:22:34] <%LordOverflow> At least we don't need to play around with autoexec bat and config sys just to get 10 extra kilobytes of memory to run game

[2022-12-22 11:26:09] <%+grimuletz> @Grim08a if you're talking about the fog, it's because of filmic something tx2aa
[2022-12-22 11:27:12] <%Grim08a> @Grim08a No I am not, I am talking about when he jumped out of the plane the game froze for like a second and also it lagged a bit in the plane. I had the same issue and turning on weapon motion blur fixes the issue
[2022-12-22 11:27:22] VIEWERS: 556
[2022-12-22 11:27:54] <%Grim08a> Yeah that is why it is lagging when you jump out of the plane
[2022-12-22 11:28:03] <%Grim08a> If you turn it on it will not be as laggy
[2022-12-22 11:28:40] <%xverso87> my motion blur is also OFF and i have no freeze  @Grim08a
[2022-12-22 11:28:49] <%Grim08a> I had the same issue only difference is that in my case the game froze for like 15-30 seconds, in your case it only froze for like a second
[2022-12-22 11:29:20] <%Grim08a> @xverso87 Do you have a AMD GPU? It seems to be an issue when you have AMD CPU and GPU, at least in the reddit post I found on the matter

[2022-12-22 11:30:14] <%Grim08a> @xverso87 Yeah that is why you don't have that same issue ;)
[2022-12-22 11:30:53] <+Atrionix> the issues people have are completely unrelated to system settings... it's a cod problem
[2022-12-22 11:30:57] <+Danwhy666> Motion blur seems to be a hot topic :)
[2022-12-22 11:31:14] <+Atrionix> so one might have intel with issues while somene else with intel doesn't have issues

[2022-12-22 11:31:53] <+Atrionix> for example, my system is fairly similar to Pawny's... yet I don't crash and IFFFFF I crash, I don't crash as often
[2022-12-22 11:33:20] <+jack__th3__ripper> Do you think using the bandera scope on the signal 50 to give it quicker ads is a better use of one of the attachment slots ?

[2022-12-22 12:42:06] <%grimuletz> yeha, i would, but should be restricted to trolls, else they'll get banned if they use it poorly
[2022-12-22 12:42:07] <High_Duty> it should be kinda exclusive and not easily obtainable if it is a free sub I think.

[2022-12-22 12:44:43] <%+Shoqz_nl> You could like use channel points to start a poll? with moderation obviously
[2022-12-22 12:44:59] <High_Duty> maybe a merch item for a lot of points?
[2022-12-22 12:45:20] <%+Shoqz_nl> Exactly
[2022-12-22 12:45:26] <%Mephist00> more like a bet, not poll, right?

[2022-12-22 12:45:52] <%Mephist00> i would vote for a prediction
[2022-12-22 12:45:59] <%grimuletz> @High_Duty a merch item would also draw attention to the merch shop and incentivize people to check it out
[2022-12-22 12:46:03] <BocaTan> 20 kills in tft?!
[2022-12-22 12:46:09] <%grimuletz> but that also means that the merch shop should always have fresh loot
[2022-12-22 12:46:16] <patri_patri> Maybe we can put funny hats and glasses animations on you, for like 10s? I seen it on Quinn69
[2022-12-22 12:46:27] <FennorBellic> ive seen d20 rolls that seem pretty fun. different outcomes per result, nat 20 gets vip for an hour, nat 1 got timed out for 2min. something like that?

[2022-12-22 12:47:55] <@%sateenvarjokauppias> I have also seen a "!first" command so the first one every stream gets a vip for the stream.
[2022-12-22 12:48:33] <@%sateenvarjokauppias> @P4wnyhof Both timeouts are currently paused due to not having time to investigate if they really are against TOS like someone said. i can start them again but i did it as precaution sometime ago
[2022-12-22 12:48:39] <%+Shoqz_nl> You could also do some troll channel point things as in a viewer which starts the ads when you are busy fighting a boss or something like that
[2022-12-22 12:49:25] <%LordOverflow> Timeouting someone else might count as bullying
[2022-12-22 12:49:49] VIEWERS: 432
[2022-12-22 12:50:00] <@%sateenvarjokauppias> Ok, so which of those is the automatic timeout redeem?
[2022-12-22 12:50:19] <%grimuletz> not to get too personal, i understand why this would be a no, but since i mean it in a harmless way: could we redeem an announcer saying "geegee" with your daughter's voice? or your voice in a funny tone? smth that isn't easily spammable
[2022-12-22 12:50:49] <%grimuletz> or "pooonyyyy" :D
[2022-12-22 12:50:54] <@%sateenvarjokauppias> Someone check if the timeout redeem is working properly now. It is activated again
[2022-12-22 12:50:58] <%grimuletz> or "horsieee"

[2022-12-22 12:52:38] <@%sateenvarjokauppias> But ill leave it on as i can do it manually if needed

[2022-12-22 13:18:55] <F1famike> @p4wnyhof can you help me with something. I see a 3080 10gb card has a lower core clock than a 3070. Is that right? Coz I’m confused as I thought clock speed directly translates to frames
[2022-12-22 13:19:56] <%flimaas> F1famike thats correct
[2022-12-22 13:20:00] VIEWERS: 446
[2022-12-22 13:20:06] <%flimaas> but not FPS whise
[2022-12-22 13:20:44] <F1famike> Coz I’m looking at a palit 3080 10gb or the 3070ti but the 3070 says on paper more clock speeds
[2022-12-22 13:21:02] <F1famike> But then watching comparison videos shows more frames on the 3080
[2022-12-22 13:21:07] <F1famike> So I’m super confused hahaha
[2022-12-22 13:21:28] <%+SneakyTapper> Hey everybody
[2022-12-22 13:21:51] <%badvalentin3> @F1famike that is translated in TDP, 3080 has more cores, almost double, so you got to give from somewhere in order to keep it cool and stable
[2022-12-22 13:22:00] VIEWERS: 446
[2022-12-22 13:22:08] <%badvalentin3> So you give in core frequency
[2022-12-22 13:22:09] <%flimaas> clock is not the only part in fps. you have transistorts, Vram and so on... and since the 3070ti has lower heat generation per Watt usage, you can push higher in clock
[2022-12-22 13:22:14] <F1famike> So if it was you would you still pick the 3080 over the 3070ti
[2022-12-22 13:22:19] <%badvalentin3> Yes
[2022-12-22 13:22:23] <F1famike> As the price difference is almost zero in the 2 for me
[2022-12-22 13:22:24] <%Mephist00> my next card will probably be a 6700xt, for 2k 60fps gaming
[2022-12-22 13:22:57] <F1famike> Ok thanks guys for the help
[2022-12-22 13:23:16] <F1famike> Yeah was just a bit worried there looking at spec sheets and seeing lower cores and boost on a better card
[2022-12-22 13:23:18] <F1famike> Got me worried
[2022-12-22 13:24:00] VIEWERS: 441
[2022-12-22 13:24:20] <%flimaas> its the same for CPUs... lower TDP and you mostly have a higher per core speed. but still multi core test are lower, while single core mostly they are better. Not allways. but most of the time
[2022-12-22 13:24:39] <patri_patri> Dat Sivir serving a lot of pizzas!
[2022-12-22 13:25:07] <F1famike> @flimaas so the 3080 would be a better choice for me
[2022-12-22 13:25:07] <%badvalentin3> @F1famike that is not unfamiliar, look at AMD 3D cache cpu, 5800X has better base and boost clock than 5800x3D. but the 3D version has huge L3 cache, Now in order to keep it at the destined TDP you have to save from somewhere, and that was the frequency
[2022-12-22 13:25:36] <patri_patri> What is that nunu doing??

[2022-12-22 13:27:06] <%badvalentin3> @F1famike yup, you get way more cores, more ram, greatly increased RAM speed in the gddr6X compared to the normal gddr6 3070 has
[2022-12-22 13:27:28] <%flimaas> F1famike best would be the 12GB 3080 which is hard to find
[2022-12-22 13:27:33] <F1famike> Thanks guys really appreciate the help
[2022-12-22 13:27:47] <F1famike> The 12gb in my country is a lot more than the 10gb version

[2022-12-22 13:28:14] <F1famike> My current card was a 3070 v1 8GB and that was plenty fine for me. But it’s broken now so I’m looking for a new card
[2022-12-22 13:28:39] <F1famike> The msi 3070ti is the same price as a palit 3080 gaming pro LHR 10gb
[2022-12-22 13:29:02] <F1famike> So I need to just know which one to choose but wanted to ask opinions first as the clock speeds scared me on the tech sheets when comparing
[2022-12-22 13:29:26] <%flimaas> Well, havent locked into prices a long time.... got my 3080ti with vitamin b last year for 800€
