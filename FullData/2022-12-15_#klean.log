[2022-12-15 17:02:08] <+BreadDorito> I've played it before on the classic version a few years ago but the Steam version makes my fortress look so good even with all the shitty stuff in there lol
[2022-12-15 17:02:21] <Rigben> you can put a pedestal in the room with one of your artifacts on it
[2022-12-15 17:02:32] <%+Kalbadour> native platinum
[2022-12-15 17:02:35] <+blazinmonkey> native plat
[2022-12-15 17:02:47] <%+Kalbadour> you could also engrave the statues with gems
[2022-12-15 17:03:00] <+DX_Plates> Encrust
[2022-12-15 17:03:05] VIEWERS: 1 090
[2022-12-15 17:03:25] <Khaladen> @kalbadour do you have to 'unconstruct' them into a stockpile to encrust them?
[2022-12-15 17:03:29] <+blazinmonkey> in order to encrust the statues - you have to remove them, put them in a stockpile then set up the jewl crafter to only encrust furniture to that pre-set stockpile
[2022-12-15 17:03:41] <StarLordsSpaceYoga> I try not to even place an item that isn't decent quality and have a jewelcrafter only encrusting certain quality items/furniture
[2022-12-15 17:03:44] <+blazinmonkey> now that micro management i DONT wanna do KEKW
[2022-12-15 17:03:45] <%iLuminaye> should see about beefing up the cavern layer with a barracks and some peeps
[2022-12-15 17:03:54] <%+Kalbadour> @Khaladen Probably, it has to be done at a gem cutters station
[2022-12-15 17:04:20] <RuilWasTaken> yah bedazzle that shit
[2022-12-15 17:04:25] <+BreadDorito> I wonder how you keep your dwarves happy? My "happiness spectrum" is the complete opposite of yours
[2022-12-15 17:04:29] <%+Kalbadour> jewel encrusting adds so much value
[2022-12-15 17:04:42] <+BreadDorito> But I had a bad start, so every dwarf is just having bad memories from the start of the fortress lol
[2022-12-15 17:04:43] <+DX_Plates> Display Cases for Artifacts?
[2022-12-15 17:04:46] <%Ws_minion> Stockpiles and stockpiles of gems, how very Dorf of you wsminiLeo
[2022-12-15 17:04:54] <Khaladen> welp, I have anither plan to inact when I play again lol
[2022-12-15 17:05:05] VIEWERS: 1 143
[2022-12-15 17:05:06] <+blazinmonkey> make sure to mini micro those stock piles for the statues and then set up the jewler to ONLY PULL from that pile
[2022-12-15 17:05:15] <+blazinmonkey> or else ....
[2022-12-15 17:05:23] <SirLansolot> Anyone know if there is a way to prioritize stock piles?
[2022-12-15 17:05:28] <+DX_Plates> Bedazzle ALL THE THINGS
[2022-12-15 17:05:51] <+blazinmonkey> @SirLansolot your new stockpile should PULL from a main pile or the pile that has the shit you want out of it
[2022-12-15 17:06:02] <%+Kalbadour> yea, they will encrust everything finished unless you specifically tell them otherwise
[2022-12-15 17:06:03] <StarLordsSpaceYoga> Caravan saw the boneyard and was like "Nerp!"
[2022-12-15 17:06:22] <+ArchReaper7> only based on stockpile
[2022-12-15 17:06:23] <+blazinmonkey> like i have a dump stockpile everything goes to with 100 wheelbarrows ... then i have all my bitch stockpiles pulling from the MAIN pile
[2022-12-15 17:06:29] <SirLansolot> @SirLansolot thats an odd way to handle it
[2022-12-15 17:06:36] <%iLuminaye> have him pull from a stockpile of furniture yeah
[2022-12-15 17:06:54] <+blazinmonkey> NODDERS
[2022-12-15 17:06:58] <+blazinmonkey> yeah
[2022-12-15 17:07:06] VIEWERS: 1 143
[2022-12-15 17:07:08] <+DX_Plates> Probably just grab the closest piece of furniture and go to town on it
[2022-12-15 17:07:36] <+blazinmonkey> meh, i dont need a shitty chalk table to have rubies in it
[2022-12-15 17:08:03] <+blazinmonkey> glass everything with encrusted gems Kreygasm
[2022-12-15 17:08:12] <+blazinmonkey> glass is king
[2022-12-15 17:08:44] <%+Kalbadour> are you making the thing that the king wants?
[2022-12-15 17:08:45] <+ArchReaper7> i got a legendary gem setter in one of my waves. tons of value
[2022-12-15 17:08:54] <+DX_Plates> A Troll Raiding Party has been spotted in the area LUL
[2022-12-15 17:08:58] <+blazinmonkey> i wonder ... anyone know if you osmoth and engrave rock ... then put glass wall in front if its all counted for room value ????
[2022-12-15 17:09:06] VIEWERS: 1 143
[2022-12-15 17:10:30] <shyyfoxxy3> U ever looked into Gloria victis?
[2022-12-15 17:10:34] <+blazinmonkey> NODDERS i have 5 dogs per hunter/fighter
[2022-12-15 17:10:35] <MisterZero_> the K9 unit
[2022-12-15 17:10:42] <%+Kalbadour> you could train the dogs into war dogs first
[2022-12-15 17:10:45] <+DX_Plates> @blazinmonkey I would bet that so long and it is in the room selection area it counts. You could probbly put rock walls in front of it and it would still aply.
[2022-12-15 17:10:55] <+DX_Plates> *apply
[2022-12-15 17:11:06] VIEWERS: 1 143
[2022-12-15 17:11:39] <+blazinmonkey> so i think the tool for room drawer only counts exposed walls ... idk how it counts the glass windows
[2022-12-15 17:11:48] <+blazinmonkey> i only every exand it to the glass ... and im at owrk
[2022-12-15 17:11:51] <+glassics> How we doin klean and chat?

[2022-12-15 17:15:23] <+blazinmonkey> @Jaspyre give them a tavern... make sure to limit it to townsfolk if you dont want randoms
[2022-12-15 17:15:32] <+AkimboSawce> have you tried out rimworld? love that game and I'm eager to hop in and try this out
[2022-12-15 17:15:35] <perfectly_wasted> have you played 8 years or 108 years?
[2022-12-15 17:15:43] <+ArchReaper7> no tavern? blasphemy!
[2022-12-15 17:15:43] <+billysboy16> Here comes a spiral....

[2022-12-15 17:15:52] <%iLuminaye> onto year 9
[2022-12-15 17:16:06] <+ArchReaper7> brawls are fine. usually
[2022-12-15 17:16:06] <zynysterg> yeah you should get justice at this point if you dont already
[2022-12-15 17:16:10] <+blazinmonkey> @AkimboSawce this is the base building aspect of rimworld - if you only like rimming for the fighting, be prepared
[2022-12-15 17:16:11] <+baka_maru> hammerer but that is how you lose all your good craftsdwarves lol
[2022-12-15 17:16:22] <PrivatePeepo> @AkimboSawce I hear Dwarf fortress took a lot of inspiration from rimworld PepeLaugh
[2022-12-15 17:16:25] <+glassics> Idk why but I really only use discord to chat with my friends while gaming. I feel like I would lose so much time in my life if I was active in random discords. I like twitch because I can work while interacting here and there
[2022-12-15 17:16:28] <+blazinmonkey> @Klean judge of intent
[2022-12-15 17:16:41] <+ArchReaper7> judge of intent, persuader, intimidator
[2022-12-15 17:16:45] <%+Kalbadour> you want a really weak Hammerer so they don't kill people they punish @Klean
[2022-12-15 17:16:45] <perfectly_wasted> this game is overwhelming. very hard to get into
[2022-12-15 17:16:50] <+ArchReaper7> your captain of the guard is your lead detective
[2022-12-15 17:16:53] <%Ljosapaldr> loyalty and willpower if you don't want them to betray you immediately upon you opening a tavern to the world
[2022-12-15 17:16:53] <+glassics> I also feel like y’all have some great discussions here which is great
[2022-12-15 17:16:56] <%+KARMERICAN> @Klean name him Jocko

[2022-12-15 17:17:14] <+baka_maru> @Klean beware of hammerers and to much law, you lose good working dwarves or legendary craftsdwarfs really easy
[2022-12-15 17:17:15] <+ArchReaper7> i literally used this screen
[2022-12-15 17:17:17] <+ArchReaper7> to pick my captain

[2022-12-15 17:17:54] <%Ljosapaldr> didn't even check if loyal and willpower
[2022-12-15 17:17:56] <+ArchReaper7> and your captain gets his own military squad. anyone you put on that squad also becomes a detective/"cop"
[2022-12-15 17:18:01] <%Ljosapaldr> get ready for corruption KEKW

[2022-12-15 17:18:25] <perfectly_wasted> can you invade other kingdoms?
[2022-12-15 17:18:25] <+ArchReaper7> personality matters a lot

[2022-12-15 17:19:26] <%Ljosapaldr> a flying titan could be fun
[2022-12-15 17:19:29] <+ArchReaper7> a captain with "poor sense of social awareness" will never solve a crime

[2022-12-15 17:23:23] <+blazinmonkey> make every space a MEETING area to encourage this

[2022-12-15 17:23:49] <+ArchReaper7> @NorthernGambit ya, it's great, until someone becomes completely depressed in all aspects of life from being caught in the rain...
[2022-12-15 17:23:59] <zynysterg> yeah but they'll do it on their own too if their interested
[2022-12-15 17:24:13] <+FuzzyMountainBeaver> god damn this game is a onion, so many layers
[2022-12-15 17:24:13] <+blazinmonkey> NODDERS its just an extra*
[2022-12-15 17:24:20] <NorthernGambit> @NorthernGambit I thought they fixed that, it's not as bad as it used to be I think
[2022-12-15 17:24:22] <%Ljosapaldr> @NorthernGambit that is gone now
[2022-12-15 17:24:24] <+AkimboSawce> damn this game is super deep, crazy they are only 50% of teh way through implementing all the features
[2022-12-15 17:24:42] <+killerbrandt555> Actually before I go, how do you handle trash?
[2022-12-15 17:24:47] <StarLordsSpaceYoga> THAT is why I avoid building on the surface instead of into a mountain. Dwarves cry about rain and get all pissy.
[2022-12-15 17:24:51] <+blazinmonkey> the depth of what you can do is in its simplicity - the more modular and broken it is ... the more tools you have to do what you want with
[2022-12-15 17:24:53] <+ArchReaper7> "that is gone" no, no unfortunately it is not. it is not as bad as it used to be
[2022-12-15 17:25:04] <+ArchReaper7> but i literally have a dwarf who has that in my current run
[2022-12-15 17:25:18] <%+Stromguard> @klean I think its mainly for areas where teaching seminars are happening though, i.e. barracks/guildhalls
[2022-12-15 17:25:33] <%Ljosapaldr> okay, it's so rare that isn't fun and interesting, not something you're gonna have half your fort suffering from
[2022-12-15 17:25:42] <+theRealWutever> At least there are no more murder carps.
[2022-12-15 17:25:42] <%Ljosapaldr> that it is*

[2022-12-15 17:25:58] <+ArchReaper7> no, it only matters for things like calculating room value
[2022-12-15 17:26:20] <+blazinmonkey> yeah, only for room value
[2022-12-15 17:26:20] <perfectly_wasted> so what is the next step?
[2022-12-15 17:26:32] <+fresh_mojo> i remember a friend of mine showing me this game in highschool and having zero understanding of what I was looking at. what an achievement to get it to this stage.
[2022-12-15 17:27:01] <%iLuminaye> that miner seems interesting
[2022-12-15 17:27:04] <+ArchReaper7> judge of intent, intimidator, persuader i think are the most important
[2022-12-15 17:27:22] <+blazinmonkey> @ArchReaper7 + not social red skill and you are good
[2022-12-15 17:27:28] <tprodigy4655> i had the biggest issue trying to get a well down... kept saying not enough space??
[2022-12-15 17:27:36] <%Ljosapaldr> do you want them to be good at interrogating, or able to withstand being corrupted by outsiders

[2022-12-15 17:28:03] <+ArchReaper7> oh man on my current run i had a Professional judge of intent/intimidator, who had insanely high social awareness, too. wish she didn't die :(
[2022-12-15 17:28:32] <+ArchReaper7> she uncovered plots unrelated to crimes just by talking to people
[2022-12-15 17:28:35] <%Ljosapaldr> My last fort every captain of the guard I had helped an outsider steal an artifact
[2022-12-15 17:28:37] <tprodigy4655> @blazinmonkey thanks! its ruined like 3 of my runs in a row lol

[2022-12-15 17:30:08] <+ArchReaper7> you can interrogate the person, to see if they confess. you can convict anyone you want

[2022-12-15 17:30:44] <+blazinmonkey> BE AWARE - dwarves LIE - they LIE A LOT ... you can convict INNOCENT dwarves
[2022-12-15 17:31:08] <+ArchReaper7> also, for some crimes, it helps to interrogate the person, because they can sometimes reveal bigger plots, or tell you who put them up to it

[2022-12-15 18:01:26] <StarLordsSpaceYoga> Every dwarf has a skill # of how good they would be, even if it's not like listed as anything
[2022-12-15 18:01:55] <StarLordsSpaceYoga> One dwarf might be 15, one might be 56, etc

[2022-12-15 18:02:36] <StarLordsSpaceYoga> Yea Klein it has the same function for combat stats, etc too so you can super easy just list every dwarf and see the stat #s
[2022-12-15 18:02:53] <StarLordsSpaceYoga> Can sort by migrant wave, skill, etc
[2022-12-15 18:02:54] <Noeat> @StarLordsSpaceYoga ye, thats like novice whatever / skilled whatever / i dont know.. whatever :) and it is listed by top level of skill as first, then lower level, then lower...
[2022-12-15 18:03:01] <Noeat> or am i missing something?
[2022-12-15 18:03:17] <+ArchReaper7> that's a huge oversight

[2022-12-15 18:04:30] <StarLordsSpaceYoga> You can also create custom job sets, like a dwarf that mines and hauls, save it as a specific set then can apply to that to any dwarf
[2022-12-15 18:04:42] <hlidskjalf77708> maybe they mistaken burrow for a burial ....
[2022-12-15 18:04:54] <%GryphonM> bro holy shit you have been grinding DF
[2022-12-15 18:05:02] <%GryphonM> knew you would love it
[2022-12-15 18:05:07] <%iLuminaye> whenever a burrow is alerted a horn should be blown, meaning you should have to craft a horn alarm to sound it and giving you the ability to create burrows

[2022-12-15 18:06:23] <%iLuminaye> it just means more stuff has happened in the world of 200 years vs, 100

[2022-12-15 18:08:04] <+hasturblaster> @Noeat i thought maybe the beasts that did remain could be even stronger
[2022-12-15 18:08:14] <%iLuminaye> greendude024 it's a uniform thingy, gotta make a uniform for a squad, set it, disband the squad and reform it
[2022-12-15 18:08:17] <%iLuminaye> something like that
[2022-12-15 18:08:44] <$Prolapsed> DF is epic, my last play through was 8-10 years ago, it consumed all my free time for a few weeks. My squad of defenders all died but for one, who went mad bathe in his friends blood, killed the goblins then made art of the goblins.
[2022-12-15 18:08:52] <+ArchReaper7> the jail needs a chain, so the door type doesn't actually matter

[2022-12-15 18:36:12] <%+Kalbadour> You could rename your dwarves after chat members if you felt like it
[2022-12-15 18:36:35] <+ArchReaper7> it could be noita-style. where they pick what the next 'thing' is every so often
[2022-12-15 18:36:49] <+ArchReaper7> but half the fun is not knowing what's coming next, idk
[2022-12-15 18:36:56] <+ArchReaper7> would be interesting
[2022-12-15 18:36:57] <Moon_Man_Miles> customizing the look of your dwarf and seeing him go on jobs would be so sick, another cog in the machine
[2022-12-15 18:37:25] <+Kanbyen> Train them on a schedule, easy to make a fighting party in a year or two
[2022-12-15 18:37:25] <%+Lukivah> meh. its wood

[2022-12-15 18:37:55] <%BUZZpunk> I wish we could switch between ascii and tileset on the fly. Learn the classic game while playing steam release

[2022-12-15 18:38:28] <numinor93> @Klean caverns are fun. It's source of the best animals that you can war train. Especially GCS my favorite, I want to do a whole fort designed around spiders where every dwarf has his own GCS pet
[2022-12-15 18:38:43] <NeftisXI> how do you know what furniture types you need for the different room types?
[2022-12-15 18:38:46] <%+Lukivah> 5 master dodgers, master fighters, all proficient or better at wrestling
[2022-12-15 18:38:48] <%+Kalbadour> I never check stats for things LUL I just go down the list and pick dwarves that aren't imporant
[2022-12-15 18:39:06] <+ArchReaper7> my current fort is dog city. every militiadwarf has 2 war dogs
[2022-12-15 18:39:52] <EladOSRS> @Klean are you having fun with df
[2022-12-15 18:39:57] <%+Lukivah> if i build a big cage can i trap with it?

[2022-12-15 18:40:22] <%+Kalbadour> does he have a hospital yet?
[2022-12-15 18:40:42] <%iLuminaye> i think he has triage but no hospital
[2022-12-15 18:40:55] <%+Lukivah> whenever i clicked the "trap live animal" button i never saw the result except for a rat chewing out now and then
[2022-12-15 18:41:44] <%iLuminaye> need to figure out stuff to do with the seeds
[2022-12-15 18:41:54] <%+Lukivah> the moment you run out of cloth fey mood "need cloth"

[2022-12-15 18:42:54] <%+Kalbadour> dwarves can get mad if their pets aren't memorialized
[2022-12-15 18:43:33] <+K4utionZ> does someone know why 2 of my dwarves who have lost 1 leg each are not picking up crutches?

[2022-12-15 18:45:00] <%+Kalbadour> I need them to add in a menu like dwarf therapist, it'll make all of the labor so much better
[2022-12-15 18:45:07] <zdendazeelul> like when he comes and tries to claim if u can tell him to fuck off

[2022-12-15 18:46:44] <Siilis108> You could have a encrusted mug and they wont like it
[2022-12-15 18:47:05] <%+Kalbadour> if you can't gift them an item then you know it will make them mad, that's how I check
[2022-12-15 18:47:18] <EladOSRS> @Klean do you have any quantum storages?
[2022-12-15 18:47:21] <Dilan434> Hey chat a soldier of mine got injured and cant move from an area how do i make my medical people help him>?
[2022-12-15 18:47:22] <Siilis108> Good idea ty
[2022-12-15 18:47:23] <+ArchReaper7> also, steel is a pretty big buff over iron for weps/armor. i highly recommend starting steel production if you haven't already
[2022-12-15 18:47:59] <%+Kalbadour> pig iron into steel is hella good

[2022-12-15 18:48:12] <+bjmunise> oh dang RIP
[2022-12-15 18:48:22] <%+Kalbadour> you might be able to check your boulders
[2022-12-15 18:48:25] <tw1tch_tex> there was another trick i saw for stacking stuff that uses the minecart dumping from a level above into a stockpile
[2022-12-15 18:48:25] <EladOSRS> @Dilan434 establish a meeting area, set a doctor/surgeon make a hospital
[2022-12-15 18:48:29] <HappysFunPalace> you can dig straight down and check every level to see if you struck flux, if its present it will be present throughout the whole level
[2022-12-15 18:48:31] <+Robknightt> cant you request flux stone from the traders to bring?
[2022-12-15 18:48:42] <%+Kalbadour> chalk, lime etc
[2022-12-15 18:48:43] <+ArchReaper7> then make sure to request it during diplomacy meets. that's tough, but you can always just dig deeper :)
[2022-12-15 18:48:45] <+bjmunise> you'd have it in your stock menu, you just need to check the stones
[2022-12-15 18:48:52] <%iLuminaye> you would have found the flux stuff around the top layers of 49~32
[2022-12-15 18:49:02] <+ArchReaper7> you are.... not close to the bottom there
[2022-12-15 18:49:08] <Dilan434> @Dilan434 Ah okay thanks i thought it was just apart of a barracks LUL
[2022-12-15 18:49:27] <%iLuminaye> need to go deeper !!! kleanEvil
[2022-12-15 18:49:30] <+bjmunise> higher levels means sedimentary level which you're in
[2022-12-15 18:49:36] <HappysFunPalace> ye you might need to go deeper then
[2022-12-15 18:49:38] <+ArchReaper7> they changed it so 0 is sea level
[2022-12-15 18:49:44] <%+Kalbadour> Flux stone is generally less dense so it rests higher in the crust
[2022-12-15 18:49:52] <+ArchReaper7> you can definitely find it deeper
[2022-12-15 18:49:53] <+bjmunise> nah you'd already have some
[2022-12-15 18:50:05] <+Kanbyen> There are 7 differnt flux stones, it can be anywhere

[2022-12-15 18:50:25] <+ArchReaper7> i currently have my guys digging on -117 lol
[2022-12-15 18:50:27] <TeeBub> is there a way to check the world map again to see if this location has flux?
[2022-12-15 18:50:58] <+ArchReaper7> @TeeBub yes, he can load the original save into a new game if he remembers exactly where he embarked
[2022-12-15 18:51:03] <%+Kalbadour> calcite, dolomite, chalk, limestone, marble are the flux stones
[2022-12-15 18:51:05] <+bjmunise> you can search the stock menu for limestone, dolomite, and chalk. if it's not there you might still have marble farther down
[2022-12-15 18:51:08] <+dererzmagier> How long is your average DF game?
[2022-12-15 18:51:08] <+ArchReaper7> and it will show in the tooltip before embarking
[2022-12-15 18:51:09] <%iLuminaye> you can, you just need to save and exit, and start a new save on this worldmap and hover over your current location
[2022-12-15 18:51:30] <+ArchReaper7> @dererzmagier depends on what you are doing. if you embark in an evil biome, could be short
[2022-12-15 18:51:41] <%iLuminaye> dererzmagier like a game of DnD
[2022-12-15 18:51:49] <+ArchReaper7> if you are 'safe' and prosperous, it's up to what you want to challenge yourself with

[2022-12-15 18:52:47] <+ArchReaper7> you can also encrust things with bones, gems, metals, etc to raise the value even more

[2022-12-15 19:41:32] <JabroniMerk> 101 Dalmatians over here
[2022-12-15 19:41:35] <bobakanuse> @RumieUS it means they are legendary at a skill

[2022-12-15 19:43:42] <%+Kalbadour> make sure you're clearing out old clothing in the fort, that stacks up pretty quickly
[2022-12-15 19:44:06] <%+Kalbadour> I think it's just whatever's closest
[2022-12-15 19:44:09] <AC_ThirtySix> you can choose mat
[2022-12-15 19:44:19] VIEWERS: 998
[2022-12-15 19:44:48] <%+Kalbadour> You select the option and then pick Mat
[2022-12-15 19:44:57] <AC_ThirtySix> on the far right says mat/color

[2022-12-15 19:45:50] <RumieUS> @klean how do you go about dealing with artifact thieves? I killed a raiding goblin and it caused...side effects

[2022-12-15 19:46:29] <%+Kalbadour> @Dulius6 create an altar and build it in a room, when it's built you can specify a temple in the zones menu
[2022-12-15 19:46:37] <%wombat_medik> ok, wasn't sure sire :D
[2022-12-15 19:47:20] <Dulius6> ty kal
[2022-12-15 19:47:57] <RumieUS> Makes sense

[2022-12-15 19:48:39] <Dulius6> Oh I got it dw
[2022-12-15 19:48:46] <%rareAesthetic> i need to figure out why i have so many children running around outside my fort. i have to keep a squad patrolling outside just to keep them safe
[2022-12-15 19:48:57] <AC_ThirtySix> @Dulius6 place a meeting place, then there is a button when you select the zone to specify further
[2022-12-15 19:49:00] <Siilis108> Half of them are pretty useless
[2022-12-15 19:49:10] <Siilis108> Also if they get injured there is no way of healing them
[2022-12-15 19:49:15] <Dulius6> @AC_ThirtySix I got it! Thanks!
[2022-12-15 19:49:32] <RumieUS> I might practice building some dwarven shotguns in a room they just so happen to be burrowing in
[2022-12-15 19:49:33] <+all_beefwiener> can't you make a human/elf doctor and they'll heal humans or elves?
[2022-12-15 19:49:34] <+XanCanth> @rareAesthetic take away the hauling chore from children and they won't go to the stockpiles you may have out there and linger
[2022-12-15 19:49:44] <JabroniMerk> How long do the kids take to grow up
