[2023-01-06 00:31:42] <sleepyymanz> @broyouwack got cursed with bap’s
[2023-01-06 00:31:44] <jaxmoonstone> instead of  immortality stopping death it should reduce damage taken by 40% and provide minor healing per sec
[2023-01-06 00:32:03] <darkothedog0> And sym stays bad
[2023-01-06 00:32:04] <sh4rks_bro> I'd bump it up to 50 - 60%
[2023-01-06 00:32:10] <darkothedog0> Forever probably
[2023-01-06 00:32:13] <sh4rks_bro> 40% is literally just an orisa ability for the team
[2023-01-06 00:32:29] <GLI7CH_TV> when I use bap I get destroyed

[2023-01-06 00:33:24] <GLI7CH_TV> when you're playing up against itno one can hit his immortality field  but when you're playing it they just focus it
[2023-01-06 00:33:29] <sh4rks_bro> like she does need to be viable
[2023-01-06 00:33:36] <sh4rks_bro> but she does not need to be objectively good
[2023-01-06 00:34:24] <sh4rks_bro> this is exactly why
