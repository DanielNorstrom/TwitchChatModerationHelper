[2022-12-28 13:21:38] <ROXYismydogsname> Trimadol has a central and spinal cord action. It promotes the opening of K+ and Ca2+ channels, causes hyperpolarization of membranes and inhibits conduction of pain impulses. Overdose leads to exhaustion and possibly death.
[2022-12-28 13:21:39] <datboynutss> @tarkychadtv doubt

[2022-12-28 14:30:02] <%EffinNipples> @Trey24k no. because of lawsuits. someone could fail to commit suicide and if you save their life you could be sued.

[2022-12-28 14:55:14] <+promnitetv> i think in major citys it's more about the show of force in numbers than the training, hence the issue

[2022-12-28 14:55:30] <AquaEnjoyerTV> Dude ok so here is the thing, martial arts is useless. Street fighting will be the hardest and a lot of them hit gyms for things like that like boxing gyms
[2022-12-28 14:55:31] <%+Reflex_US_> ya they should definitely have more training in hand to hand combat we have the SWAT team to come in with guns blazing
[2022-12-28 14:55:32] <goldendragon11> should be non lethal force only
[2022-12-28 14:55:33] <%jakeandbake334> it easier said than done. you could raise the pay but would you ever be a cop @Trey24k?
[2022-12-28 14:55:35] <%+fundraser> if i was a cop i would want to do it just to increase my chances of surviving

[2022-12-28 18:24:31] <!%InLikeFlint> thats not PC
[2022-12-28 18:24:31] <pappichulliog> scripted
[2022-12-28 18:24:32] <%Kaigey96> Should have said " no i dont want you to search my car." but the officer would have said "I have probable cause now because of the alchohol" and boom same boat
[2022-12-28 18:24:34] <peakysnete> cops are allowed to lie tho they get away with it anyway
[2022-12-28 18:24:35] <%+dieselnj217> SIR YOULL HAVE TO TALK TO MY ATTORNEY MIKE SAXMAN
[2022-12-28 18:24:36] <oopssorryguy> if they have to ask they don't have probable cause
[2022-12-28 18:24:38] <rezpektin> HE LIEX
[2022-12-28 18:24:38] <EBfromLC> You can‚Äôt tell a cop no they just gonna put the pressure on you after that
[2022-12-28 18:24:42] <!%calebtothemax_> FACT
[2022-12-28 18:24:43] <+Loudpacjak> ok in the real world they do whatever they want because most people cant afford a "decent lawyer"
[2022-12-28 18:24:44] <%Qnasher> Isnt probable cause = he has to ACTUALLY see something ?
[2022-12-28 18:24:45] <RusskyyMedved> depends in some states its legal for cops to lie to adults
[2022-12-28 18:24:46] <+DeceiveSin> he has probable cause with smell
[2022-12-28 18:24:47] <%VOLKSFRAGEN> if you say no to the search theyll just call the dogs to scratch your car up with their nails and say they alerted on something
[2022-12-28 18:24:47] <%+ClutchSR> smell of alcohol is probable but then saying he doesnt think he is drunk kills that cause
[2022-12-28 18:24:48] <kalpatv> he admitted to having weapons in the car tho
[2022-12-28 18:24:48] <rezpektin> HE LIED OFF THE JUMP
[2022-12-28 18:24:48] <+Storm_Chaser5> He didn‚Äôt call saul
[2022-12-28 18:24:48] <+RIOTslow> are you playing with rengarw

[2022-12-28 18:24:52] <PizzaYaaaa> but he asked him if he can search it and he agreed
[2022-12-28 18:24:54] <%+Reflex_US_> well if all he has in there is the other two knives he mentioned then he wont get in trouble

[2022-12-28 18:25:00] <%HarrisonsGodFather> I have refused any search I have been asked to do. And they hate that shit.. They will keep asking, and pushing it, but never give in

[2022-12-28 18:25:02] <xstaymerking> they found a knife thats already probable cause i think

[2022-12-28 18:25:04] <+Yourenogoood> He lied about a knife in his back pocket they would have probable cause anyway
[2022-12-28 18:25:05] <%+Secretbeast> I only say yes to cavity searches

[2022-12-28 18:25:05] <@%+stopdodgin> "lawyer" then they have to arrest you AND still search your car
[2022-12-28 18:25:06] <%oooktony> also probable cause doesn‚Äôt include the trunk
[2022-12-28 18:25:06] <%$llewdac> No you don‚Äôt, he said he has two more knives in their bag he had probable cause. Sorry that‚Äôs not how that works lmao.

[2022-12-28 18:25:08] <@KingsEntourage> I got nothing to hide
[2022-12-28 18:25:08] <whtn0iz> That‚Äôs why he called it in consent to search because he didn‚Äôt have probable cause
[2022-12-28 18:25:09] <sneakyturtlemg> Better Call Saul
[2022-12-28 18:25:09] <+peekin_duck> true but the cop has leverage because of the knive.
[2022-12-28 18:25:11] <+its_spankers> They do not need probable cause to search a vehicle
[2022-12-28 18:25:12] <therottenveggie_> this chat never encountered a situation like this

[2022-12-28 18:25:14] <+hot_coffee_enema> make them bring the dogs if they want to search that hard
[2022-12-28 18:25:14] <realcampbowl> Ayooooo
[2022-12-28 18:25:16] <+H0GANSHER0> not only did he have the smell but that weapon is illegal so they have the right to serech more and they would just send a dog @Trey24k
[2022-12-28 18:25:17] <$bee_uhmazed> Homie was fucking up from the first time he opened his mouth lol
[2022-12-28 18:25:19] <StoneyBologny> they have to run a dog at that point.
[2022-12-28 18:25:21] <%+soniccthesnail> never allow a search always get a lawyer
[2022-12-28 18:25:21] <%oooktony> got a whole weed charge thrown out cause they illegally searched my trunk once
[2022-12-28 18:25:22] <Attica1971> Best plan of action is to not have anything illegal??

[2022-12-28 18:25:26] <sm0cey> BETTER CALL TREY
[2022-12-28 18:25:27] <+brgrjoe> Yeah he can deny search cause no probable cause
[2022-12-28 18:25:30] <+dylanz1369> He‚Äôs on the boy
[2022-12-28 18:25:30] <%Kaigey96> He didnt have an option bruhther. They were searching when they smelled the alcohol
[2022-12-28 18:25:31] <peakysnete> i agree with you, but you're fucked either way

[2022-12-28 18:25:44] <%OsamaTinBin> they have ways to do it without asking
[2022-12-28 18:25:44] <sneakyturtlemg> True but they will wait around for hours and call a canine unit to try and fish for probable cause
