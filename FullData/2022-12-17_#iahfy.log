[2022-12-17 23:59:15] <@%+Door1531> @toastghost18 Taiko was bad girl and left her boarder guard post to chase some bad guys. Bad guys were actually super bad guys who were used to distract her. Other super bad guys got through to the capital (her mom's house) and attacked. Broot held them all back on his own until Taiko realized what happened and showed up. Taiko was distracted fighting evil boss man by Synth screaming when Broot died. The distraction led to her losing an eye. Bad guys ran off. Broot dead. Synth traumatized. Taiko
