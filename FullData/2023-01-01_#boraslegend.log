[2023-01-01 20:35:15] <%+GhostD> Tuchel did not clash with the owners. It wasn't like that. Boehly was asking Tuchel to explain the football side of thing whilst also asking Tuchel to be involved in the decision making on new players coming in whilst training players. Tuchel thought was too much. Boehly wanted Ronaldo and was surprised when Tuchel said he didn't want Ronaldo.
