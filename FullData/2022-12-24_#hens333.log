[2022-12-24 15:20:21] <babyjuice20> @Hens333 Every match I play the killer instantly tunnels the first person he chases. And they also decide to camp with many gens left. Do u have the same?
[2022-12-24 15:20:27] <%eviedudette> @somethingjacket Yes, it says it reduces grunts while injured. Also doesn't work when you are exhausted hensGlad
[2022-12-24 15:20:35] <%+ForestGrandpa> Most of the people that "bully" the killer actually crave the attention, so if you give them none they will be bored quick and leave to find another victim

[2022-12-24 16:52:17] <animism11> I think the respect they give to p100 is the effort and time consuming hensNotes_TK

[2022-12-24 17:09:08] <+diobrandurr> This match reminds me of when I used to play Warframe. I played for thousands of hours, and there was a ton of grind. All of it became just so tedious that I just got burned out.
[2022-12-24 17:09:30] <mightytwex> @kitefruitz same thing happened to me on dusty noose with devour hope trapper
[2022-12-24 17:09:55] <mibbsy> when youre stuck like this your best bet is to let killer decide if you get hatch anyway
[2022-12-24 17:10:02] <@%Ana1661> Yeeeee
[2022-12-24 17:10:10] <+zoedorable_> ye you can jump on the thingy and cut the killer off a lot

[2022-12-24 17:11:21] <%+hibrrnate> I'm more surprised the game doesn't auto kill the surv when they're down and last
[2022-12-24 17:11:26] <$CasualSleepyGamer> Good for them
[2022-12-24 17:11:26] <mightytwex> when 2 people left, the next person who goes down gets automori'd and then the hatch opens

[2022-12-24 17:12:05] <SmackemJack> @hibrrnate why? you can unbreakable? could have key? wake up to get the door open fast too many possibilites
[2022-12-24 17:12:06] <+diobrandurr> @hibrrnate It is because they have a chance to crawl to hatch. But the hatch was closed... so they really should have just killed the survivor when it closed

[2022-12-24 17:13:13] <%AMGC7> @Ana1661 Some people like Twins too, the deal is that devs dont give them the rework they need. Swamp is stuck on ugly graphics
[2022-12-24 17:13:17] <%eviedudette> @mightytwex btw are there going to be reworked Finisher mori? Like in your example or something
[2022-12-24 17:13:19] <%+hibrrnate> yyeea ik there's ways to get up n all but I haven't seen anyone bring a key so after hatch closes I dont see the point in getting up you're not gonna open that gate lol unless ya know blind luck and killer let's you
[2022-12-24 17:13:19] <!%distrruder> yeah ahah
[2022-12-24 17:13:22] <+YourWifesBoyfriend__> what's spirit called then?

[2022-12-24 17:13:26] <%+DerKoaLa22> ngl the german names for spirit and wraith are really bad as well tho
[2022-12-24 17:13:32] <mightytwex> @eviedudette doubt it it wasn't well received
[2022-12-24 17:13:34] <%+glass_kingdom8> Merry Christmas man! Youre my Fav DBD streamer
[2022-12-24 17:13:42] <ninjadragon21345> @grappigevalentijn it kinda makes sense, cause the name wraith is kind of an evil spirit

[2022-12-24 17:14:14] <weiiffer> yeah, in brazil wraith is called “the spirit” too
[2022-12-24 17:14:15] <%PaendaTV> You were still lucky, us dutchies almost never got translations paendaDed
[2022-12-24 17:14:17] <!%distrruder> no wraith is called ghost actually
[2022-12-24 17:14:19] <%the_oracle_> iirc some of the german translations for pokemon names are pretty funny
[2022-12-24 17:14:20] <%Doctor_God> German words in general are kinda big

[2022-12-24 18:20:11] <Loewenbraug> I just enjoy watching
[2022-12-24 18:20:16] <+spacedud3> just to find you you gotta know the game a bit
[2022-12-24 18:20:16] <$drCalico> 1600 here but tapered off quite a bit lately
[2022-12-24 18:20:19] <+rusty420nl> yo hens nice bubba plays
[2022-12-24 18:20:19] <%A2Zephyr> guys hours dont directly equal skill but it's very hard to play for 8k hours and not be quite good
[2022-12-24 18:20:21] <humira4men> I have 400 hours on the switch of all platforms LOL
[2022-12-24 18:20:22] <BulgeConnoisseur> Hours mean nothing, dbd is as skillful as smash bros imo
[2022-12-24 18:20:23] <1800Bedtime> when you win the addon is good duh Kappa
[2022-12-24 18:20:23] <+firestorm427> lmao I mean I play a bit but I always watch, such an entertaining game to watch
[2022-12-24 18:20:24] <kitefruitz> If I have 50 hours but I play like a 3000 hour player can I vote 3000?
[2022-12-24 18:20:28] <+fallshd> i meant to click 0-500 guhh
[2022-12-24 18:20:29] <RustyOsprey9347> I have 30 hours in DBD but I'm just a tryhard
[2022-12-24 18:20:30] <@%Loni1211> Waaait u put chili after engraving :(

[2022-12-24 18:20:37] <dustedl> Hours don’t mean Anything
[2022-12-24 18:20:37] <BraveKeyBoardWarrior> in my 500000 hours I can confirm that basement bubba is best
[2022-12-24 18:20:41] <calistar125> 500 hours is still a lot
[2022-12-24 18:20:42] <detectiveshirogane> I once had a friend tell me they think Trickster is broken despite never playing Trickster
[2022-12-24 18:20:47] <%+Heronik_> I have 3.3k but feel like I have 400 hours in lobby time KEKW

[2022-12-24 18:21:19] <Lockon_TV> Watching gets you knowledge not experience which is a huge difference. Knowing what to do and actually being able to do it
[2022-12-24 18:21:24] <Loewenbraug> I don’t even exactly know the difference between bubba and billy. One day someone will explain that to me… I hope

[2022-12-24 18:21:45] <asyashi> @Loewenbraug bubba is pretty weak whereas billy is also pretty weak
[2022-12-24 18:21:54] <@%animeangel09> modCheck any gen rushers
[2022-12-24 18:21:56] <Ourotheboros> billy zooms with his chainsaw and has one slash, bubba runs around with multiple slashes
[2022-12-24 18:22:09] <+jurian___> @Aventasaurus damn... i havent seen any in like weeks
[2022-12-24 18:22:22] <juniorprs> @Loewenbraug Billy goes fast and cant really steer and Bubba goes slower but can control moviment
[2022-12-24 18:22:30] <Jd_crash> @Loewenbraug bubba easy to play, billy hard to play

[2022-12-24 18:25:50] <%A2Zephyr> stealthing promotes tunneling
[2022-12-24 18:25:51] <HighkouGaming> people who stealth after an unhook are the worst

[2022-12-24 18:27:01] <Rhys_Ravaged> I love when 3 survivors stealth all game and then blame you for tunneling or wanting to body block while one person death hook.

[2022-12-24 18:49:24] <%the_oracle_> 2 4%s is still technically possible, unlikely but possible
[2022-12-24 18:49:33] <+snailwhisperer> Deliverence maybe

[2022-12-24 18:49:50] <the_epiceerie> @firestorm427 I think its a 6% chance of it happening if no slippery meat or map offerings
[2022-12-24 18:50:00] <%eviedudette> Was there a luck offering + slippery meat and  Up the ante? or what
[2022-12-24 18:50:02] <%+ForestGrandpa> if those 2 also kobe its probably up the ante stacking cheaters

[2022-12-24 18:50:27] <ahomelessmannamedfred> it is a 0.16% chance for 2 people to kobe first try afaik, definitely not 6%

[2022-12-24 19:30:42] <%ObsidianLiger> @Hens333 maybe she was clensing at full HP, but not broken and you injured her?
[2022-12-24 19:30:46] <%+xploitr13> My wife mains Plague, but is probably low-mid MMR. She believes cleansing against her is the way to go. I can't say I agree. If you know how to loop, your team shouldn't cleanse. What do you think?
[2022-12-24 19:30:50] <%+hibrrnate> yea it heals my mending and health state last time i fountain
[2022-12-24 19:31:00] <Altairri> Yea that's new same with doctor when you snap out your mend timer stops

[2022-12-24 19:31:40] <%Pandom__> The more important part is where you cleanse when you need to do so
[2022-12-24 19:31:43] <+ekul_brown> Plague is really strong imo

[2022-12-24 19:31:54] <%+SpencerPlaysGG> How often should you cleanse against Plague?
[2022-12-24 19:32:00] <%AMGC7> @Its_The_Doug or a shadow nerf to not being able to mend before snapping out
[2022-12-24 19:32:02] <JDSpirit_> ok but on a serious note, what quick  tip could you give me for learning blight?
[2022-12-24 19:32:06] <+ekul_brown> especially with the right builds

[2022-12-24 19:35:17] <%Pandom__> Maybe a hotter take but I think tier 1 should be 4.4m/s
[2022-12-24 19:35:22] <someonenew222> i think his tier 1 is just a unnecessary nerf tbh

[2022-12-24 19:36:25] <+VT_Doggo> it should take 1/3 the time to get to t2, t1 still has some use early game sometimes

[2022-12-24 19:36:44] <+BG_Beast_> straight tier 3 would be broken but maybe an addon to infinitly stalk survivors as a ultrarare would be fine
[2022-12-24 19:37:18] <%Pandom__> I don't think infinite stalk should be an ultrarare at all, I think having a limit on stalk makes 0 sense
[2022-12-24 19:37:23] <%+xploitr13> Yea i think the update broke this map now

[2022-12-24 20:02:11] <!%frekdunder> Thats why if you do the bug to TP to same portal you become invicible for hole game BloodTrail

[2022-12-24 20:02:23] <!%YourFriendLumpy> dredge nightfall just puts a black filter in front of your camera that like demo when traveling
[2022-12-24 20:02:47] <Crazymack556> lol so can you detect demo with spine chill flying through the map?
