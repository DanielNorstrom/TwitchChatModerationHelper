[2023-01-03 09:27:48] <%Zeroslayer> I've put it off for months cus I got burned out playing the game.
[2023-01-03 09:28:13] <%Zeroslayer> Guild wars 1 is the tits but old guild wars 2 is good but I prefer ffxiv Madge TeaTime
[2023-01-03 09:28:14] <Thirtyfour> what class do you play?
[2023-01-03 09:28:19] <%Criptonix100> @Thirtyfour GW2 Post LWS4 is bad story wise is bad
[2023-01-03 09:28:25] <%Criptonix100> GW1 is Super good
[2023-01-03 09:28:42] <Thirtyfour> idk anything about gw1 or gw2 besides the classes
[2023-01-03 09:28:42] <%Thelete> you probably got another month or two until mike gets to gw2 during MMO december KEKW

[2023-01-03 09:30:38] <%Zeroslayer> ArenaNet has never been known for good class balance.
[2023-01-03 09:30:45] <%ravenribb> Bwop TeaTime
[2023-01-03 09:30:53] <Thirtyfour> can you change clases in GW or is it like EQ where you choose a class and upgrade
[2023-01-03 09:31:10] <%Zeroslayer> You choose your class in character creation
[2023-01-03 09:31:15] <%Criptonix100> @Zeroslayer actually in GW1 they had a good balance and their system was about 2 class skillsets to choose
[2023-01-03 09:31:15] <%Zeroslayer> So like wow I guess.
[2023-01-03 09:31:41] <%Thelete> ye its like wow where you pick the base class but got specializations you can swap between
[2023-01-03 09:31:41] <%Zeroslayer> @Criptonix100 Yeah but that's GW1, GW2 has never been known for good balance Madge
[2023-01-03 09:31:42] <%Criptonix100> well...except in GW1 Mesmer was the goat KEKW

[2023-01-03 10:16:30] <%$fudia> What is a friend?
[2023-01-03 10:16:30] <%P4rappa> I have a good time healing raids. M+ not so much.

[2023-01-03 10:16:34] <Yr_Helwyr> Is this a full time WoW stream now?
[2023-01-03 10:16:38] <zysmos> KEKL
[2023-01-03 10:16:38] <%ArroArroArro> i have one accepting apps
[2023-01-03 10:16:40] <%$cr00ker> Savathun is dead tho
[2023-01-03 10:16:47] <mike32s> not true, plenty of people run m0, also heroics are unnecessary
[2023-01-03 10:16:48] <%Notsure_Shookalex> Def not for weekly being for 4 mythic dung
[2023-01-03 10:16:49] <%+masenka_> loads of people are still doing m0 for alts.....
[2023-01-03 10:16:52] <%Dooplett> I've skipped heroics on every character and I'm a solo player
[2023-01-03 10:16:54] <HalensFFXIV> mistake number one is doing heroics. they are useless
[2023-01-03 10:16:56] <+toobored> now that's the prob going heroics to gear for m+ KEKW
[2023-01-03 10:17:02] <zodd_amhai> they are loads of poelpe doing M0 im doing one now
[2023-01-03 10:17:02] <%KelticNight> PUG life problems
[2023-01-03 10:17:03] <%Agro1969> Mike, that's NORMAL
[2023-01-03 10:17:04] <+baggie95> You can literally get to 385 doing world content without stepping foot into m+
[2023-01-03 10:17:06] <+iiVendettaNA> tons of people are doing m0 lol
[2023-01-03 10:17:08] <%+Boomslang552> Nah skipped it completely
[2023-01-03 10:17:08] <randomnumber39> Never did a single heroic
[2023-01-03 10:17:09] <%+Braggardt> Simply put Mike, some people just don't want to make friends or join a community
[2023-01-03 10:17:09] <Unrealsiege> normal to m0 for me
[2023-01-03 10:17:09] <%War_kebab> dont think i have done any heroics
[2023-01-03 10:17:09] <%Neroniss_> dont elemental storms drop higher gear than m0?
[2023-01-03 10:17:10] <%+Ravkha> A +2 is pretty much a M0 at this point, super doable
[2023-01-03 10:17:10] <$FelPlague> Why would you need to run m0? run some low level m+'s, also heroic was like literally only needed week 1.
[2023-01-03 10:17:10] <%+nisk___> hit 70 did like 8 M0
[2023-01-03 10:17:10] <Guyladriel> I did
[2023-01-03 10:17:10] <+AtomJar> there are tons of m0 going especially this week with the quest
[2023-01-03 10:17:11] <%+MrZxorm> My GF took the first week of DF off due to holidays, now has better gear than me
[2023-01-03 10:17:11] <mike32s> went 70 straight into m0
[2023-01-03 10:17:12] <+Mr_Livesey> literally no reason to touch HCs
[2023-01-03 10:17:12] <%+Kammalla> did like 1 heroic maybe
[2023-01-03 10:17:14] <%+Spira> Thats a long ass way to gear tho
[2023-01-03 10:17:15] <Machetank> just go to m0 directly
[2023-01-03 10:17:16] <+1mcadams> i dont think ive done a heroic since MOP
[2023-01-03 10:17:16] <+ItsDuckarus> bruh you just start a group and people join
[2023-01-03 10:17:16] <+JonnyConrad> heroic is skipped
[2023-01-03 10:17:17] <%+Rhob> By the time you can queue in HC you have enough ilvl to run m0
[2023-01-03 10:17:17] <%trickydice> I did. Most people do that
[2023-01-03 10:17:17] <%+nisk___> heroic is not for gearing
[2023-01-03 10:17:18] <%+Kingpin192> they're probably on at the wrong times
[2023-01-03 10:17:18] <%tazman524> day 1 while waiting for people to lvl @Preachlfw  KEKW
[2023-01-03 10:17:19] <moosewerk> it's normal in the pug life
[2023-01-03 10:17:21] <+Cubick23> that makes sense
[2023-01-03 10:17:21] <%beskarsilver> I did some but M0 requirements are all over the place
[2023-01-03 10:17:21] <%Dooplett> I jump straight to m0 the second I had 340
[2023-01-03 10:17:23] <randomnumber39> I had guildies COMPLAIN that they had to do heroics
[2023-01-03 10:17:23] <+slowdkay> did 2 heroics then went into mythics
[2023-01-03 10:17:23] <+kalorna> went straight to M0
[2023-01-03 10:17:24] <%+Rhob> You should be able to queue HC with no ilvl req
[2023-01-03 10:17:27] <%MagicPants_99> people think they need to do hc first
[2023-01-03 10:17:27] <%+grimwolfuk> geared to hit the ilvl to enter M0
[2023-01-03 10:17:27] <NightWolf070> I have geared up in Heroics exactly once, when I had ever played endgame before. Never done it since
[2023-01-03 10:17:32] <%+Braggardt> NODDERS
[2023-01-03 10:17:34] <ati_ofthesix> we were running m0 before we were geared enough to be allowed into heroic
[2023-01-03 10:17:36] <%KelticNight> good luck getting into a m0 with questing greens LUL
[2023-01-03 10:17:37] <%Notsure_Shookalex> Normal, 2 heroic dung, then into mythic 0
[2023-01-03 10:17:38] <%Roctis_> I've gotten gear better than what heroic gives just from world quests and rares lmao
[2023-01-03 10:17:39] <%Warden120> I dont really play wow, how much harder is m0 than heroic?
[2023-01-03 10:17:40] <+Belazoth> as a dps i dont get accepted into mo until i got +30 ilvl than needed to do the content
[2023-01-03 10:17:43] <+ItsDuckarus> i hit 70 and straight in mythic
[2023-01-03 10:17:44] <zysmos> Just jump into +2s
[2023-01-03 10:17:46] <sniffsc> Especially now that WQ and Crafted gear is so good there is no point
[2023-01-03 10:17:46] <%+Spira> If you have played early expansions it is the thought process tho
[2023-01-03 10:17:52] <zysmos> that's ez
[2023-01-03 10:17:52] <+Flex2142> just open your  own group, especially this week some just wanna do the weekly quickly
[2023-01-03 10:17:53] <Trafikk_> i didnt do ANY normal or Heroic Dungeons at all :P
[2023-01-03 10:17:55] <moosewerk> I dinged 70 and did m0 right away on my heals but my dps toons nobody would take me
[2023-01-03 10:17:57] <%Smapdi_Flaffermann> Heroics don't have a purpose anymore
[2023-01-03 10:17:58] [Notification] doctorfizzlebang subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months!
[2023-01-03 10:18:06] <%+Braggardt> But when you're doing pugs you're practically required to overgear the content to even be considered (if you're dps at least)
[2023-01-03 10:18:08] <+Huduu> BS everyone was running M0 this week for weeklyt
[2023-01-03 10:18:11] <%War_kebab> man i dinged my shaman yesterday and just got greens from AH and jumped into M0.. who the hell does heroics
[2023-01-03 10:18:11] <Roomkaasje> the game does a horrible job of guiding people on what to do
[2023-01-03 10:18:13] VIEWERS: 1 497
[2023-01-03 10:18:15] <+Huduu> Also if you start your own group people will join
[2023-01-03 10:18:17] <%+nisk___> he is playing the wrong game
[2023-01-03 10:18:17] <%trickydice> If you’re dps, you won’t get invited to m0 often unless you’re high
[2023-01-03 10:18:20] <%+Braggardt> and yes the answer is to make your own groups
[2023-01-03 10:18:26] <dorman24> NODDERS
[2023-01-03 10:18:31] <ninzx> are you blocked from m+ without m0?
[2023-01-03 10:18:32] <%+Teorino1984> i was setting up M0 as a dps in the last two days whilst in greens and had no issues
[2023-01-03 10:18:36] <%KelticNight> if a low level ilvl starts their own group people avoid cos they assume they want a carry LUL
[2023-01-03 10:18:37] <%+masenka_> this person is just stupid and stubborn and blizzard cant be held responsible for that
[2023-01-03 10:18:37] <%blainyy> People genuinely have anxiety I think

[2023-01-03 10:18:51] <mike32s> yeah I made m0 groups for my tank and my partner and we got huge pumpers that wanted to do 4 mythic weekly quick... blasted through
[2023-01-03 10:18:53] <%+Teorino1984> got my key, set up the +2 key and still got tanks and healers willing to join
[2023-01-03 10:18:57] <+skedej> for your own grps u dont need ilvl coz u cant get kicked @Preachlfw
[2023-01-03 10:18:58] <%Cara1977> I'm 386 ilvl just completing world content
[2023-01-03 10:19:00] <+MrTRage> Biggest issue is finding like minded people on a similar skill level. So ive stuck to auction house grinding for now
[2023-01-03 10:19:02] <Cates> im struggling find groups as a solo player. 386 dps evoker, people requiring achievements but i cant get into a pug in the first place
[2023-01-03 10:19:04] <%+Quatron> For a lot of people its a huge hill to climb to start groups
[2023-01-03 10:19:05] <$FelPlague> this week alone M0 is FULL of people just doing the "do 4 m0 to get a heroic raid item" @Preachlfw so like wtf this persons complaint?
[2023-01-03 10:19:07] <%+crispysnowball> read the comments, the guy was 340
[2023-01-03 10:19:08] <Xytrixz> I get the "just make your own group response" but some players don't like the responsibility of that, which I can also understand
[2023-01-03 10:19:10] <+AtomJar> same problem....make friends have them carry you to ok ilvl
[2023-01-03 10:19:15] <%Fataldh> Just build up your own key
[2023-01-03 10:19:16] <%+nisk___> LITERALLY M0S EVERYWHERE
[2023-01-03 10:19:20] <%+Braggardt> I made my own M+ group yesterday and at the end got berated by the tank because one of the DPS I invited underperformed KEKW
[2023-01-03 10:19:23] <+iiVendettaNA> people literally do mythic 2-5 at like 345 LUL
[2023-01-03 10:19:25] <zysmos> plenty of groups lmao
[2023-01-03 10:19:26] <%$Jauffre_> I've hardly had time to play because I've been moving house but because I'm in a guild, they're helping me fast track my gear now
[2023-01-03 10:19:26] <%+Spira> I think there is alot of anxiety of joining even m0 as well tho
[2023-01-03 10:19:28] <%beskarsilver> I've tried setting my own groups up and generally have been fine. I've also tried joining M0 in PuGs on my Mage and get declined constantly
[2023-01-03 10:19:35] <ninzx> i see nothing here
[2023-01-03 10:19:36] <+ItsDuckarus> i just host my own groups at ilvl 319 on my alt no problems
[2023-01-03 10:19:37] <%+Ravkha> I made my own M0 groups at 330 ilvl on alts, had no issues
[2023-01-03 10:19:41] <ninzx> no m0s
[2023-01-03 10:19:41] <Roomkaasje> groups up and actually getting invited are 2 different things
[2023-01-03 10:19:41] <+Gazman162> There's so much gear available with enough ilvl to do m0s xD
[2023-01-03 10:19:41] <$FelPlague> @Preachlfw also look up "tour" as lots of people name it world tour not m0
[2023-01-03 10:19:41] <ninzx> :D
[2023-01-03 10:19:46] <%+Azalis1701> good keyword to use if you are unsure is "learn"
[2023-01-03 10:19:46] <%KelticNight> just put "no rush, chill group" in title and you tend to get decent people
[2023-01-03 10:19:53] <Machetank> check m2-4
[2023-01-03 10:19:54] <+Vandarian> TDP returns when?
[2023-01-03 10:19:56] <+toobored> don't see the prob there echoesportHmm
[2023-01-03 10:19:57] <Gorodon> If you feel that the gear isnt enough for M0, cant u fill it up with rare/world quest gear?
[2023-01-03 10:19:57] <%+Braggardt> People don't apply ilvl restrictions but there's still an unspoken preference
[2023-01-03 10:19:57] <+PlattyPuss_> i just dinged a character and got declined for a lot of groups as a mage so i just ended up having to make my own group
[2023-01-03 10:19:58] <%Agro1969> try pugging a mzero in green gear
[2023-01-03 10:19:58] <Valvax> always make your own group. it takes time but it works
[2023-01-03 10:19:58] <%+SlayerKM> no issues getting into m0's this person is just being a odd one lol
[2023-01-03 10:20:00] <$FelPlague> nvm not anymore i guess

[2023-01-03 10:20:02] <%Ookami7113> I was 370 ilvl and couldn't get into a M0 group for weekly NotLikeThis
[2023-01-03 10:20:08] <%Neverlast> isn't a M+1 just easygame anyway? do a quick M0 then go do +1's and 2's and downgrade your key if you need? @Preachlfw
[2023-01-03 10:20:11] <Xytrixz> @Braggardt I made a group for M0 spam for last weeks weekly and a DPS told me to kick the healer after one run because they were low geared, we had no issues KEKW

[2023-01-03 10:20:30] <spookefr> To be honest, with some basic you can even join <+5 with less than heroic stuff
[2023-01-03 10:20:42] <+samaelulu> yep for sure
[2023-01-03 10:20:51] <+1mcadams> you can straight up buy 359 gear with the currency from primal storms
[2023-01-03 10:20:51] <moosewerk> right
[2023-01-03 10:20:52] <%Cara1977> storms
[2023-01-03 10:20:53] <+toobored> maybe he needs a guide? someone link him fatboss guide KEKW
[2023-01-03 10:20:55] <%+SlayerKM> i ding my alts and end up in a m0 very quickly, this person is living in a fairy tale lol
[2023-01-03 10:20:57] <%+ayiana_sevo> that's a change
[2023-01-03 10:20:57] <%+Siranot> Imagine not doing the soup SMDH
[2023-01-03 10:20:57] <ninzx> i got 380 ilvl just doing world stuff
[2023-01-03 10:20:59] <mike32s> ONE SOUP??
[2023-01-03 10:20:59] <%+SchwarzStork> Its games fault though, for telling people to do heroics, especially if you played back in the day where heroics were the way to go
[2023-01-03 10:20:59] <%KelticNight> I ran one m0, no m+'s and my rogue is 383
[2023-01-03 10:21:00] <yifors> outdoor content scales with ilvl so... they prob see it as trash
[2023-01-03 10:21:03] <%AngryFil> pgeHoo pgeDo pgeYou pgeDo
[2023-01-03 10:21:03] <MrGM> Wouldn't have this problem if they were in a guild 👀
[2023-01-03 10:21:04] <Milanesa_De_Pollo> heroic dungeons, or heroic raids?
[2023-01-03 10:21:04] <Jeanssi> I got to 382 without doing single dungeon, just outdoor content
[2023-01-03 10:21:10] <%+Eltreum> truth is he's playing catch up
[2023-01-03 10:21:10] <%+masenka_> i dont wanna be harsh but they are just dumb
[2023-01-03 10:21:13] <%+Kastraios> another thing is we don't know this persons skill level
[2023-01-03 10:21:15] <%+SlayerKM> the scary thing is that these people exist haha
[2023-01-03 10:21:19] <%+Rhob> he might just not know, just grab crafted gear and jump into M0
[2023-01-03 10:21:21] <%Fataldh> I read stuff like this and i just get 'playing victim' vibes, there is so much more way to get geared then just M0, super rares, storms now, crafted gear
[2023-01-03 10:21:24] <%KelticNight> WoWhead was everyone's guide LUL
[2023-01-03 10:21:25] <%ArroArroArro> you have like 4 sparks now as well. you can get 405 items from that right now easy @preachlfw
[2023-01-03 10:21:26] <%Dragonnan> My Evoker alt is 370+ with no real effort put into it, only had a Lariat made for it
[2023-01-03 10:21:28] <tr0kgaming> 100%
[2023-01-03 10:21:33] <Roomkaasje> its hard to know all the rare/superrare stuff etc without spending time googling
[2023-01-03 10:21:34] <%+Siranot> @MrGM For real, I don't think I've ever stepped foot in a heroic DF dungeon
[2023-01-03 10:21:39] <+Twinbros2> Anyone have a suggestion for a replacement for Recount? I'm a VERY casual gamer so don't need something fancy, just like to see my numbers
[2023-01-03 10:21:39] <+toobored> someone link him a wowhead guide god help him
[2023-01-03 10:21:40] <CrazyMike1991> I haven't even gone into heroics or mythics and my IL is 381, it's super easy
[2023-01-03 10:21:42] <Sturmax> ilvl scales with your ilvl tho
[2023-01-03 10:21:48] <%beskarsilver> Heroics are basically useless. It also doesn't help that you need a high level ilvl to even get into the heroics when you can do mythics in worse gear than that
[2023-01-03 10:21:51] <+TheRealBitsy> Twitch has warned me this is a mature stream :)
[2023-01-03 10:21:53] <$FelPlague> Wait pre-storms? even pre-storms you did a couple heroics max then just did your weekly m0 tour
[2023-01-03 10:21:54] <+AtomJar> well the rares drops scale with ilvl
[2023-01-03 10:22:09] <+godmilk__> @Twinbros2 details! or skada
[2023-01-03 10:22:11] <moosewerk> daily heroics are for augment runes and that's it now

[2023-01-03 10:22:41] <%+Siranot> @markja629 It scales with your ilvl. So your rewards get better each week up to a certain point
[2023-01-03 10:22:56] <+mystlineid> What im seeing is people can gear up how they want now.. if people are whining about missing out or not being able to do content thats just on them tbh

[2023-01-03 10:23:29] <ResidentMadman> But you have to enjoy the game to play it and if you dont like the loops then you dont like the game
[2023-01-03 10:23:32] <%Methuzila> that's an L take tbh imo

[2023-01-03 10:23:41] <randomnumber39> I actually see where that guy goes to because it makes sense from his point of view, sadly the game doesnt work that way but it makes sense
[2023-01-03 10:23:43] <$FelPlague> "game forces me to play" in what way? it forces you to play by having content?
[2023-01-03 10:23:45] <shytam> I get the rat race feeling of it
[2023-01-03 10:23:53] <hey_rooo> i mean im debating loggin on for bi weekly resets, u want to but sometimes its just zzz
[2023-01-03 10:23:58] <%beskarsilver> I wasn't happy that dungeons basically became a rush rush as soon as M+ came out in normals
[2023-01-03 10:24:00] <fingerfoc92> isn't it the core of mmos? rat race
[2023-01-03 10:24:00] <+iiVendettaNA> people accept 345 ilvl for mythic 2 lol if he's actually heroic geared he just needs to queue up

[2023-01-03 10:24:21] <moosewerk> yeah that's what happened to me on my lock last week
[2023-01-03 10:24:22] <mike32s> It does feel overwhelming, I think, if you need to 'catch up', for the same reason that the game doesn't really signpost things. But there's always people looking to run content it would take to gear a new 70, so whenever you join you can get there.
[2023-01-03 10:24:22] <+ItsDuckarus> this person just delusional imo
[2023-01-03 10:24:23] <%Succath> Getting gear is not the problem.
[2023-01-03 10:24:24] <soti1> I made my own group for M0s, literally took 1 minute to form a group
[2023-01-03 10:24:25] <%+SlayerKM> people like this baffle me
[2023-01-03 10:24:29] <zysmos> that guy is probably very bad at the game

[2023-01-03 10:24:49] <%War_kebab> capped my shaman yesterday and did m0 in AH greens i am 360 on it now and started with like 330
[2023-01-03 10:24:51] <+TheRealBitsy> Grinding for gear has been a staple like even in classic u cant expect to hit 60 then immediately do nax or AQ
[2023-01-03 10:24:52] <%ArroArroArro> @preachlfw we are getting 5-10 apps a week now in my guild. thats the situation going on with decent guilds/communities

[2023-01-03 10:24:58] <ozzybbq> so feshly dinged kill rares daily?
[2023-01-03 10:24:59] <%+nisk___> not hard
[2023-01-03 10:24:59] <+kalorna> I dinged my priest on 28th December and I'm 385 now
[2023-01-03 10:25:00] <%+SlayerKM> it really triggers me that people like this exist let alone type on the internet lol
[2023-01-03 10:25:05] <+weeb_dude_> maybe they can only play in really bad hours and no one reallyp lays
[2023-01-03 10:25:08] <%Chalkosss> with 350 ilvl i was getting invited to m0 yesterday
[2023-01-03 10:25:08] <uniqeornrider> I feel like regardless what the content is people would always find something to whine and complain about
[2023-01-03 10:25:17] <$FelPlague> Storms came out with M+ so they couldnt have unsubbed before storms came out @Preachlfw
[2023-01-03 10:25:24] <sniffsc> Crafting and WQ/ Rare gear is SO strong in dragonflight

[2023-01-03 10:25:27] <%+Spira> Isnt the storm 385 gear capped by the eggs?
[2023-01-03 10:25:27] <%+SlayerKM> i can imagine they are the type to be in local facebook groups complaing about the traffic or something haha
[2023-01-03 10:25:29] <+ItsDuckarus> i mean at 319 ilvl i still make groups ezpz
[2023-01-03 10:25:31] <seawolf_87> mike it's not your repsonsibility to care for this player
[2023-01-03 10:25:33] <shytam> I think just letting them know they shouldn't stress so much
[2023-01-03 10:25:33] <%Dragonnan> I made a group for m0 Brackenhide on my Devastation Evoker. Had a Vengeance Demon Hunter tank in 336 ilvl. We beat the dungeon. Took a bit longer, because healer left and I had to respec and heal for the first time since Cataclysm, but got a good DPS in my place and we did it. Only left 2 people die on last boss, I managed until then.'
[2023-01-03 10:25:36] <%Saint473> @preachlfw sounds like they tried to get a group on off hours or a doomsayer like normal.
[2023-01-03 10:25:36] <%KelticNight> you couldn't, Blizz could've. they should've promoted rares, chest, events etc better.
[2023-01-03 10:25:41] <shytam> that they're not missing out by taking a few days longer
[2023-01-03 10:25:42] <Xann7> @beskarsilver yep, had a tank in normal neltharus just ran straight to the boss room, it was kinda chaotic.
[2023-01-03 10:25:43] <%+Siranot> @Preachlfw If you're playing at awkward hours, even pugging M0 can be difficult but not impossible
[2023-01-03 10:25:44] <+AtomJar> man if there on your twitter they defo should know better when it comes to gearing
[2023-01-03 10:25:52] <Cimexis> I mean.. totally anecdotal here.. but I didn't farm rares at all, and I've had no issues doing m+. Though you can't expect to get into, for instance, a +16 if you've no experience in +15s etc. You're simply not picked in that case.
[2023-01-03 10:25:55] <%+Rhob> HCs are pointless cause you can't queue until 346 or something which is stupid
[2023-01-03 10:26:02] <%KelticNight> I'm 383 and i've ran zero m+'s LUL
[2023-01-03 10:26:12] <%+Kingpin192> some people also think the primetime hours are late at night when it's really something like 4-8pm

[2023-01-03 10:26:17] <%nessardo> People are doing Heroic because it's queueable, m0 is not and getting constantly rejeted or ghosted can feel frustrating
[2023-01-03 10:26:18] <%ArroArroArro> just join me haha
[2023-01-03 10:26:22] <pupkat> @Preachlfw he has a point... but he can also get 343 crafted gear for 2-3k a piece
[2023-01-03 10:26:33] <%+Rhob> @nessardo Agreed, m0 should be queueable
[2023-01-03 10:26:40] <$FelPlague> oh yeah bloody tokens are insanly fast to farm and thats 366/385 gear, just doing the WQ's/looting warcrates.
[2023-01-03 10:26:42] <+Riot_Blacktimus> Didn't do a single Mythic dungeon first two weeks and already 7/8 HC 400 ilvl, loving all the different ways to gear this expansion
[2023-01-03 10:26:43] <%SZebra> Wierd. On Sunday night my Group Finder was *full* of M+12-16 etc, but only had a handful of M0 groups'

[2023-01-03 10:27:03] <Kimolainen> The Catch up in dF is sooo easdy tho
[2023-01-03 10:27:04] <$FelPlague> rep tokens also become account wide when you hit max renown.

[2023-01-03 10:27:05] <moosewerk> it's like the Pandaria rep boosts
[2023-01-03 10:27:07] <%KelticNight> make gear Account Wide, dagnabbit Madge
[2023-01-03 10:27:09] <asmodai4823> renown also doesnt really matter
[2023-01-03 10:27:09] <%Fataldh> Renown doesn't = player power, it's utterly option
[2023-01-03 10:27:10] <moosewerk> it sucks
[2023-01-03 10:27:11] <%+chivmuffin> Why? Renown gives zero power?
[2023-01-03 10:27:13] <%beskarsilver> The boost is fine but it's still slow imo
[2023-01-03 10:27:13] <%Ookami7113> but the kill rares for 385 gear, is only if you have a certain item lvl to start with otherwise it's still ok gear but usually blues
[2023-01-03 10:27:16] <%+Braggardt> With the 200% boost from rank 20 I found myself at around 20-22 on all factions after doing all the sidequests
[2023-01-03 10:27:21] <+smashmode420> doing the elemental storms and turning in the cores can get some pretty high Ilev gear
[2023-01-03 10:27:21] <+ItsDuckarus> ready for the final fantasy system frfr
[2023-01-03 10:27:26] <%+ayiana_sevo> Yea, I leveled mage to Valdrakken, then switched to pally and was disappointed to see renown level didn't carry over
[2023-01-03 10:27:26] <%+DzikiWegorz1223> I mean, let's wait for relic weapons grind in FFXIV, it's brutal
[2023-01-03 10:27:27] <%$chris_babaganoosh05> You still just feel behind on rep unless you do all the zone quests
[2023-01-03 10:27:33] <THECooja> half the rewards from renown are already account wide, so why not just make the entire thing account wide?

[2023-01-03 10:29:02] <Milanesa_De_Pollo> That doesn't add up
[2023-01-03 10:29:02] <shytam> I think you're missing his point, it's not about difficulty at all

[2023-01-03 10:29:04] <%beskarsilver> I had someone rage at me for declining them in an M0 after the group was full. They thought they should get in due to higher ilvl and to boot someone else
[2023-01-03 10:29:06] <$FelPlague> felplaWhat felplaWhat felplaWhat felplaWhat Cutting edge but doing heroics?
[2023-01-03 10:29:08] <%Dragonnan> Made a group for Brackenhide 0 on my devoker. Had a veng dh tank in 336. We beat the dungeon. Took a bit longer, healer left after first boss, I had to respec and heal for the first time since Cata, but got a good DPS as my replacement. Only had 3 deaths under my first watch. I was below 370, none of them 350+.
[2023-01-03 10:29:12] <shytam> he's just stressed out
[2023-01-03 10:29:16] <Cimexis> With lower 340 you can do HCs to increase your ilvl. People dont tend to invite you if you "skip a step" in the gearing process, so I sort of understand why they're not invited to m0.
[2023-01-03 10:29:16] <%ravenribb> xddTree lore time ?
[2023-01-03 10:29:16] <%+DzikiWegorz1223> @Fataldh Yeah, that's it
[2023-01-03 10:29:18] <+Magaruis> To be fair , the point by the OP stands.  If you are lower geared , people aren't going to pull you through M0's.  They want to cruise through the dungeon with the minimal amount of work.
[2023-01-03 10:29:19] <Mattilainen> that person meant to say "i bought CE carry in legion/BFA and I'm struggling"
[2023-01-03 10:29:19] <djeran1982> they need to remove the extra quest/event you have to do with the weekly 3k rep grind for alts

[2023-01-03 10:29:43] <%+Siranot> If I want to do dungeon quests, I just do normals because it's face roll and I want my quest done and I'm not doing RLP M+
[2023-01-03 10:29:49] <randomnumber39> So I think that guy was looking for a reason to stop playing, had a guildie who farmed for 2 weeks to get to 390 before raid opened and then quit last week because of a bug that didnt let him roll on raz hlem in a pug
[2023-01-03 10:29:50] <%+Rhob> HC = m0 indeed

[2023-01-03 10:29:55] <ResidentMadman> Yeah Heroic should just be m0
[2023-01-03 10:29:56] <+smashmode420> this is actually one thing the guy answerd in your tour on wow.. they made it alot more easier to get gear for solo players, but if you want to get the best you gotta find a group to go with.
[2023-01-03 10:29:57] <%Shelana95> @Preachlfw  90k affli ?

[2023-01-03 10:30:07] <+nidavellir> the fact you need to be 341ilvl to Q for HC dungeons make them pointless
[2023-01-03 10:30:07] <%+thelimitedone> but if hc dosen't make any sense then does mythic in dungeons?
[2023-01-03 10:30:07] <%+Velvarun> there are a lot of people baiting and complaining for nothing the wow forums are a mess right now

[2023-01-03 10:30:13] <+FergMy> Heroics were literally for the time before M+ releasing when you capped M0. Now they are pointless
[2023-01-03 10:30:14] <mike32s> you need like 340 to queue heroic even it's wild
[2023-01-03 10:30:15] <Trafikk_> then you fine to do Mythic )

[2023-01-03 10:30:20] <+walljunior> I did heroics once, to see the fights first
[2023-01-03 10:30:20] <+ryazilla26> Isn’t worth it with the drop chance
[2023-01-03 10:30:21] <%+PvtHudson093> we had 2 weeks of heroic before M0 came out
[2023-01-03 10:30:21] <%Ookami7113> herioc is repeatable tho but M0 isn't you get locked, they should remove the locking on M0
[2023-01-03 10:30:23] <%JakeZGR> Love you my cuties mopHug mopLove
[2023-01-03 10:30:23] <%beskarsilver> You need 342 to get in
[2023-01-03 10:30:23] <%+Spira> Its good to get the hang of dungeons if you are new though
[2023-01-03 10:30:25] <%+Ashidomus> I guess HC is to be cleared before M0s open on day 2 KEKW
[2023-01-03 10:30:29] <moosewerk> I've been thinking about recruiting for m+ in heroics
[2023-01-03 10:30:29] <Kimolainen> Do heroics for 2 days or so yo uwill be close to 360, get your own key start m0 groups and voila. this guy is just whining
[2023-01-03 10:30:29] <Trafikk_> Mythic 0 ^
[2023-01-03 10:30:31] <%Dragonnan> Heroic dungeons are there, I think, to fill gaps in gear that the rares, mythics and profs don't fill if you have bad RNG. Plus to get the rings for the ottuk mount.
[2023-01-03 10:30:33] <%Medias> Still don't get why you can't just queue for M0
[2023-01-03 10:30:34] <+walljunior> m0 couns
[2023-01-03 10:30:36] <i__tv> they are to many difficulties in the game imo is confusing for newer player
[2023-01-03 10:30:36] <%Fataldh> They work in zeroes
[2023-01-03 10:30:37] <%+Teorino1984> they work in m0
[2023-01-03 10:30:38] <%+GwynPally> am i just unlucky cause i've done siege on dragon keep multiple time and have yet to get a single piece of gear from it o.O
[2023-01-03 10:30:39] <Kirzan> M+ could really use Classic's group finder tbh.
[2023-01-03 10:30:42] <+gorblade_69> The only reason for heroics are pretty much the training matrixes for crafting... But that's about it
[2023-01-03 10:30:44] <+Vapo> you loot them from end box of m+
[2023-01-03 10:30:51] <hey_rooo> with the world quests u dont need the old world style of heroics cause u out ilvl it ez
[2023-01-03 10:30:55] <$FelPlague> heroics really only matter in the weeks before m+ opens, after you have already full cleared m0.
[2023-01-03 10:30:56] <%SZebra> I didn't get credit for the painting quests in M+ last night
[2023-01-03 10:30:59] <%+humpybumpy1> I guess the difference is m0 is once per week and heroic can be spammed in finder. But definitely needs some changes
[2023-01-03 10:31:02] <%beskarsilver> The group finder needs a bit of an overhaul tbh
[2023-01-03 10:31:07] <%+Teorino1984> there should be no "normal" at max level - that ought to be heroic
[2023-01-03 10:31:08] <%+Siranot> Heroics were literally only good for day 1 / day 2 capped characters
[2023-01-03 10:31:20] <MrGrievsy> m0 should be in the finder and repeatable, will help people start up fresh groups as well
[2023-01-03 10:31:25] <%+Siranot> Once WQs hit, they became completely useless

[2023-01-03 11:16:02] <%+MrBobbas> There's a trick here to have two clickers on first ballista. It only does damage for one, but it unlocks both the other ballistas for second shot.

[2023-01-03 11:37:07] <moosewerk> you have to get the whole group to move in order to move the archers
[2023-01-03 11:37:09] <zilinskas> elvui and addons do that

[2023-01-03 11:39:06] <%ilandra> @blainyy normalizing volume I guess. Since discord is louder Mike gets muted when normalization says discord needs muting.
[2023-01-03 11:39:08] <grahame64> those longbows are designed to slow you down , don't fall for it , stun  hornsounder casts for mass enrage , kite plainstompers or lancemasters on top of longbows

[2023-01-03 12:22:10] <%Neroniss_> funny thing was he was still tanking fine even when dc'd :D
[2023-01-03 12:22:19] <%Neroniss_> warrior definitely not OP
[2023-01-03 12:22:28] <%+Atomise> I took the dogs out what happened ?
[2023-01-03 12:22:33] <%SinRedblade> so would say he tanked better after the DC Kappa

[2023-01-03 12:22:58] <%Neroniss_> we died to 3 people getting stinned by thundering because you cant clear on dc'd person
[2023-01-03 12:23:01] <%ilandra> The only good tank is an offline tank
[2023-01-03 12:23:35] <%SinRedblade> only good tank is a non Mile tank KEKW
[2023-01-03 12:24:38] <%KhalBones> does this mean uninstall?
[2023-01-03 12:24:41] <+Moai> tank leaving the group is the real dragonflight experience
[2023-01-03 12:25:14] <%ilandra> @khalbones naaah, there will be some excuses, like “not my fault” etc.
[2023-01-03 12:25:23] <%Neroniss_> first a healer leaves, than a tank, mike toxic confirmed
[2023-01-03 12:25:48] <%ilandra> @moai really? Wow. Used to be healers leaving. Or that one dps after the first wipe.
[2023-01-03 12:26:08] <%Neroniss_> healer leaves when tank dies too much
[2023-01-03 12:26:18] <%Neroniss_> tank leaves when tank dies too much because healer cant heal
[2023-01-03 12:26:45] <%Neroniss_> dps leaves when tank dies too much and they get killed subsequently as well
[2023-01-03 12:27:19] <%Neroniss_> so it's always the tank's fault
[2023-01-03 12:27:54] <+Moai> no its healer fault
[2023-01-03 12:27:56] <+Moai> always
[2023-01-03 12:28:02] <%ilandra> I remember there always being that one guy “if we don’t time it I’m out”. They go for 15 minutes and when you have 5 minutes left on the timer they leave, because you need 5 more minutes,
