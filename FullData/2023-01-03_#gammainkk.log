[2023-01-03 12:21:35] <umbra_sky1> highest dungeon you have access to thats not a 50 60 70 80 since they give less EXP than the ones in between. and run fates while waiting for Q

[2023-01-03 12:42:45] <umbra_sky1> dont use ninjutsu when you wait for it to come back. that way you have the most uses during your trick attack
[2023-01-03 12:43:01] <umbra_sky1> thats the best way to do dammage
[2023-01-03 12:43:31] <@%$Scotty_ManOfCulture> Have you got D'nutsu yet?

[2023-01-03 12:57:48] <AtrophyAtomic> As a Reaper you build up a bar that can be spent on big slaps. Those big slaps give you edgy boy points that can be spent on additional big slaps, except this time they're coral blue number 57 gloss lipstick. Then once you've kissed enough boys to build up your fashion bar, you get to turn into a Spooky Ghost.

[2023-01-03 13:57:58] <AtrophyAtomic> No parking, you cant park, but you are allowed to idle in the area. No standing, you cannot park or idle, you can only pick up or drop someone off.

[2023-01-03 14:31:15] <Extrahu3> Weaving is using OCGDs in between GCDs NODDERS
[2023-01-03 14:31:23] <Kamisan89> Weaving basically mean you do something while your normal attack is cooling down
[2023-01-03 14:31:29] <%+VES_Typh00n> I wish I was an RPG person. Hence why I‚Äôve been playing a lot of the Witcher 3 recently LUL
[2023-01-03 14:31:46] <Extrahu3> NODDERS yeyeyeyeyeye
[2023-01-03 14:31:48] <steinzu> See those skills that put other skills on cooldown ? That's the gcd aka global cooldown, there are some skills that don't get cooldowned, you use those skills in between
[2023-01-03 14:31:58] <AtrophyAtomic> Ranryu
[2023-01-03 14:32:17] <Kamisan89> Double weaving means you use 2 skills while your attack is cooling down
[2023-01-03 14:32:22] <umbra_sky1> so weaving is putting oGCD between your GCD. a GCD is when all your skills fall in cooldown after using one. if you use your single  target combo
[2023-01-03 14:32:25] VIEWERS: 530
[2023-01-03 14:32:36] <umbra_sky1> oGCD is basically your super long cooldown
[2023-01-03 14:32:43] <umbra_sky1> youll realise overtime LUL
[2023-01-03 14:32:45] <Extrahu3> NODDERS you'll get it in time
[2023-01-03 14:32:58] <steinzu> You'll get it shisReguman
[2023-01-03 14:33:33] <umbra_sky1> you shouldnt use any jutsu outside of trick attack basically
[2023-01-03 14:33:37] <Extrahu3> NODDERS raiton will be your filler on Single target
[2023-01-03 14:33:42] <umbra_sky1> except the suiton that allows you to use trick attack
[2023-01-03 14:33:46] <iUzue> GCD skills are labelled as weaponskills ingame, oGCD as "ability"
[2023-01-03 14:33:48] <Extrahu3> NODDERS ideally you wanna hold Ninjutsu for next trcik
[2023-01-03 14:34:01] <pilles123> You look like my cat he‚Äôs with me now
[2023-01-03 14:34:13] <Extrahu3> NODDERS then when your Trick is almost off colldown your roll your suiton
[2023-01-03 14:34:22] <Extrahu3> since the buff lasts for 15s
[2023-01-03 14:34:27] VIEWERS: 524
[2023-01-03 14:34:29] <+kutsuumugen> When you use a skill you see most of your skills go on Cooldown, some will not. Those are skills you can use in between the Cooldown, hence Skill Weaving. Hope that helps
[2023-01-03 14:34:29] <umbra_sky1> you dump all your raiton in too yeah
[2023-01-03 14:34:30] <Extrahu3> yeee you wanna hold ideally
[2023-01-03 14:34:31] <AtrophyAtomic> The best way i can explain GCD Weaving is using moves with cooldowns that have INSTANT.  during the 2.5 c seconds between your co bo attacks.
[2023-01-03 14:34:33] <umbra_sky1> just not outside of trick
[2023-01-03 14:34:42] <%$kernymi> gotta build up the muscle memory so you can do the jutsus without the cheat sheet
[2023-01-03 14:34:54] <Extrahu3> Bavakrava same idea, try to hold for trick window
[2023-01-03 14:35:02] <plutonyooom> Yoo i think it's cool you're trying to learn. Keep it up o/
[2023-01-03 14:35:11] <umbra_sky1> if you look under the dummy's health bar on top of your screen youll see the debuff i showed you earlier

[2023-01-03 14:35:45] <umbra_sky1> but yeah thats the plan. raiton, Hyosho, tenchijin and all in trick attack
[2023-01-03 14:36:09] <Extrahu3> NODDERS yeyeyeyeyeye
[2023-01-03 14:36:11] <AtrophyAtomic> 3 or More Targets AOE, 1-2 Targets 1v1
[2023-01-03 14:36:13] <%$kernymi> wait for tank to finish pulling before you put down Doton
[2023-01-03 14:36:14] <plutonyooom> For 3+ enemies, AoEs
[2023-01-03 14:36:23] <umbra_sky1> pretty much AoE on 3+ monsters. katon is stronger on 2+ monster
[2023-01-03 14:36:27] VIEWERS: 524
[2023-01-03 14:36:30] <Extrahu3> There are very few situations where you wanna funnel damage into 1 target if there are multiple enemies around
[2023-01-03 14:36:34] <plutonyooom> fruuug is big AoE damage
[2023-01-03 14:36:39] <umbra_sky1> so you can use your earth puddle. AoE skills and use katon on cooldown

[2023-01-03 15:24:02] <umbra_sky1> in theory if you do it the same way everytime youll have 1  mudra up and youll suiton when you're about to get the second one back. that way when you Trick attack and do your ice into tcj into your raitons youll get an extra mudra
[2023-01-03 15:24:04] <%$itsbfginnit> Hi everyone!
[2023-01-03 15:24:10] <umbra_sky1> thats why you get 2 raiton in your trick attack

[2023-01-03 15:32:21] <%$kernymi> if you use two hotbars, role actions and long cooldown always go to hotbar 2
[2023-01-03 15:32:21] <CurrySauseBandit> @Extrahu3 So as someone that does do ctrl + 7 up to 9. If they are using ctrl + 7, it's used for stuff you pop infrequently.
