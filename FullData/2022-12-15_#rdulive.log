[2022-12-15 17:19:30] <Moop547> theres 2 problems with mercs. 1: the insane amount of grinding you need to do to get a decent comp and 2: their refusal to nerf things
[2022-12-15 17:19:39] <+wayyman> Mercenaries was also super unbalanced when it first came out.  I remember them having to put out a huge pack very quickly after the launch.

You've even got a girlfriend, which is pretty impressive all things considered. I sometimes watch your stream at work and I just want to tell you that I respect what you've done, even though I'll always be better than you lol. Merry Christmas RDU, Tanner.
