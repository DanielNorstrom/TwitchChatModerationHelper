[2023-01-08 01:06:06] <%vaGnomeMagician> @churchofcthulhu nah, she's married to the game tomatoCool

[2023-01-08 01:06:24] <HyperMetalix> AI in trainer battles?
[2023-01-08 01:06:25] <Kavris_Ragehoof> Nemona's whole thing over the course of the plot is that she wants to guide you (the player) to the point where you're a proper opponent. Remember: she wanted to use her original team when you had just gotten your first pokemon.
[2023-01-08 01:06:33] <!%Laimubot> we unlocked LEAN

[2023-01-08 01:06:55] <Kavris_Ragehoof> She was literally going to curbstomp you with her original team at the start of the game if Clavell hadn't reminded her not to.

[2023-01-08 01:07:56] <%Your_New_Adoptive_Parents> Yeah like they could've shown her using her badass strong pokemon to beat someone up

[2023-01-08 01:13:50] <%kepheru446> Arven's story is by far the best of the 3 ye
[2023-01-08 01:13:51] <08Juan80> 1) Arven
[2023-01-08 01:13:53] <%sugarprincet> i love all 3 storylines

[2023-01-08 01:14:03] <%haplaplon> Arven feels like the main rival even though pneumonia is supposed to be that
[2023-01-08 01:14:03] <08Juan80> I love them all, but Arven is on the top

[2023-01-08 01:14:11] <08Juan80> Penny is a close second
[2023-01-08 01:14:12] <%$Grahfvitnir> I loved the fact i started out disliking Arwen, only to build a real affinity for the dude.
[2023-01-08 01:14:12] <%SoulTea> Larry is best girl
[2023-01-08 01:14:17] <+angel_chelsi> I weirdly like Arven for some reason
[2023-01-08 01:14:18] <SirBaltheus> Arven has the best story out of the 3 imo
[2023-01-08 01:14:20] <+ghost_mira> If the main character was allowed to have a personality we 100% would have been Arven on a quest to save our pupper

[2023-01-08 01:14:46] <Kavris_Ragehoof> Arven is kind of the shadow protag, since the 'active' professor is his parent, and a lot of the game is his issues.

[2023-01-08 01:18:13] <08Juan80> now to beat the shit out of Arven?
[2023-01-08 01:18:14] <%KowlDoogle> all the voice acting budget went to ed sheeran
[2023-01-08 01:18:17] <+angel_chelsi> is it time?
[2023-01-08 01:18:18] <%KitsuneofTime> she gave us wins
[2023-01-08 01:18:20] <victaghost> @vaGnomeMagician nah
[2023-01-08 01:18:20] <%Somazure> they spent their vocie acting budget on ed sheeran's song

[2023-01-08 01:18:23] <%+ubermanthehutt> Or the Zelda voice noises when they speak “huh” “heya!”
[2023-01-08 01:18:23] <%+Vvaldir316> yea it was very clear they got time crunched

[2023-01-08 20:36:50] <nickjaquez26> I feel like part of the problem is that there’s lip syncing to the words but no voice acting

[2023-01-08 20:48:21] <+Pachi3000> it's good I just wish they had any interaction at all earlier in the game
[2023-01-08 20:48:24] <%+SleepyCorpse_> This game has the best written characters in a long time for Pokémon games

[2023-01-08 20:48:31] <+collectaBK7> @OneManAgainstheOdds yes but you can't see other player characters. their spawns appear though
[2023-01-08 20:48:31] <%the_lost_messenger> @OneManAgainstheOdds You can do it to get [SPOILERS], but you can't have multiple players in there shown.
[2023-01-08 20:48:34] <%chromapon> @Doormatt X and Y were so close to doing that :(
[2023-01-08 20:48:43] <%$Bugsy_23> @OneManAgainstheOdds yes, but in a0 you can't see the people you play with. can still spawn pokemon for eachother though

[2023-01-08 20:52:30] <%the_lost_messenger> I'd argue Legends has better visuals than SV. Probably due to how the lighting is used in each game.
[2023-01-08 20:52:32] <TheHylianGuard> Would shiny Laimu have yellow hair?

[2023-01-08 20:52:55] <blightyoverflow> @the_lost_messenger yeah thats true. both legends arceus and scarlet/violet wouldve easily gone done as some of the best games in the series if gamefreak had more time for polish

[2023-01-08 20:53:07] <TheRandomHam> I think the lack of stylization is the biggest reason this game's graphics feel bland/bad.

[2023-01-08 21:06:56] <%OneManAgainstheOdds> so... 1995 limesSip
[2023-01-08 21:06:56] <$dragonwatcher22> the only "dick" moment is the serious excitement she gets to see all the pokemon here and battle them
[2023-01-08 21:06:57] <%kepheru446> 87 years. Ancient
[2023-01-08 21:07:00] <%$EPee_Em> 87 might as well be ancient
[2023-01-08 21:07:02] <samiam1616> yes the bed is the important part here

[2023-01-08 21:07:11] <%MakorelFish> I mean 87 years might as well be ancient
[2023-01-08 21:07:12] <%von_ragnar> There's no mean thought in Nemona's head. There's not many thoughts there in general, but it still counts
[2023-01-08 21:07:12] <%donn_is_me> what if we put our area zero research lab beds next to each other 😳
[2023-01-08 21:07:12] <%earin_copper> Nemona: "Oh no there's only one bed"

[2023-01-08 21:07:19] <DonCorlyfries> what are we unlocking monkaS
[2023-01-08 21:07:19] <Kavris_Ragehoof> To be fair to Nemona, tech in Pokemon is super schizo, since they could cheat with, like, Electric pokemon for early stuff long before we'd have electricity...

[2023-01-08 21:13:34] <teefpal> @onegoodtoad The shows made for kids, so they're not gonna go with an adult protagonist

[2023-01-08 21:13:34] <%Mortal_Quinn> Cheren and Bianca are still the best rivals
[2023-01-08 21:13:35] <%NovaAurora> lots of space for grazing
[2023-01-08 21:13:38] <%chromapon> it was a big family
[2023-01-08 21:13:38] <+vincentvangoatt> It's a cool place
[2023-01-08 21:13:39] <+Pachi3000> giraffes all the way down
[2023-01-08 21:13:39] <@Doormatt> Wasn't like the first thing he did like absolutely abandon a pokemon too? Why does he get to be a researcher
[2023-01-08 21:13:39] <%Scaythly> And all of them want your blood
[2023-01-08 21:13:43] <TheKamenZero> Giraffes are scarry.
[2023-01-08 21:13:44] <%EasySqueezy01> Wow limes ageism much??
[2023-01-08 21:13:44] <%Mylexsi> ash just doesn't age, for reasons unknown. gary is just built different; if you remember, out of the 8 badges in the kanto region, Gary earned 12 of them
[2023-01-08 21:13:44] <+Pokenomicon> In the JP dub they haven't mentioned ages in YEARS
[2023-01-08 21:13:44] <%$peekas0> Maybe he got magna cum laude in Harvard or something.
[2023-01-08 21:13:45] <%Terravir> ye but 10 year olds seem to rule the world in pokemon. They beat criminals, hack the government, and beat up god
[2023-01-08 21:13:45] <%$EPee_Em> Streamer too busy to notice Penny dunking on Nemona

[2023-01-08 21:13:46] <Triza9000> for me ash was finished in diamond/pearl that's where he seemed to peak and then they brain reset him for black/white cause he was too good
[2023-01-08 21:13:46] <CryZe92> @danaeSignal it kinda can't. He doesn't have a last name in japanese
[2023-01-08 21:13:47] <%haplaplon> The giraffe hole

[2023-01-08 21:13:57] <@%Kovubot> limesPoggers
[2023-01-08 21:13:57] <TheKamenZero> Nope.
[2023-01-08 21:13:59] <%$EPee_Em> Third faction
[2023-01-08 21:14:00] <%+jakebob5557> nope
[2023-01-08 21:14:01] <%+joporice> Nope usually against them
[2023-01-08 21:14:01] <%NovaAurora> they were independent
[2023-01-08 21:14:01] <+Pachi3000> different factions
[2023-01-08 21:14:01] <%RebeccaHeegaard> No, they're usually enemies
[2023-01-08 21:14:01] <%chromapon> I think they were rivals
[2023-01-08 21:14:01] <+Iceckryss> they're separate
[2023-01-08 21:14:02] <%Scaythly> They did their own thing
[2023-01-08 21:14:05] <%SoulTea> team rocket
[2023-01-08 21:14:05] <@%KieueCaprie> @Kovubot THAT'S RIGHT KOVU! LORE!
[2023-01-08 21:14:06] <danaeSignal> @CryZe92 that's what will make it so groundbreaking
[2023-01-08 21:14:06] <%+jakebob5557> Just another faction alongside Team Rocket
[2023-01-08 21:14:07] <%$Bugsy_23> jesse and james just do their own thing
[2023-01-08 21:14:08] <teefpal> They're independent
[2023-01-08 21:14:08] <Kavris_Ragehoof> Usually, they'd be rivals to the local baddy Team.
[2023-01-08 21:14:09] <%$Flammadeus> they were just kind of.... there
[2023-01-08 21:14:09] <%donn_is_me> @Limealicious you know that image from the office where everyone is pointing guns at each other
[2023-01-08 21:14:11] <%Skyfairer> TR was a side team in the other regions
[2023-01-08 21:14:12] <+vincentvangoatt> The teams did their thing, Team Rocket were not ont heir side, and soemtimes helped Ash and crew
[2023-01-08 21:14:13] <+Busterinabox> They became C plot instead of B plot LUL
[2023-01-08 21:14:14] <%DamianMc15> more or less of that
[2023-01-08 21:14:14] <%dinnydanny777> Cyrus is in the Diamond and Pearl series
[2023-01-08 21:14:17] <+Pachi3000> They were just always interested in Pikachu
[2023-01-08 21:14:18] <%Mortal_Quinn> was Ghetsis in the anime limesO
[2023-01-08 21:14:19] <enith_firestar> Most of the times against the faction too
[2023-01-08 21:14:20] <samiam1616> Jesse/James/Meowth just did their own thing, invovlement with other villain teams was usually its own arc separate
[2023-01-08 21:14:21] <%$EPee_Em> tl;dr "literally nothing ever changed ever" I don't know how else to say it to you
[2023-01-08 21:14:22] <%Ultima_Weapon02> The further Gary is away from ash, the normal flow of time continues for him @limealicious
[2023-01-08 21:14:22] <@%Doormatt> This is like the warhammer lore thing all over again
[2023-01-08 21:14:24] <JohnTheChillMan> Jessie James and Meowth are the best parts of the anime tbh
[2023-01-08 21:14:24] <theworsttimelime> is Team Rocket also retired?
[2023-01-08 21:14:24] <%OneManAgainstheOdds> nope. Jesse and James worked independently. and the TEAMs did their in game equivalent bullshit

[2023-01-08 21:14:26] <+Mario1080p> Gen 5 was interesting where Team Rocket was actually serious in their job
[2023-01-08 21:14:30] <samiam1616> kinda
[2023-01-08 21:14:31] <%Scaythly> Technically
[2023-01-08 21:14:32] <%$adamdotpng> they are antagonizing
[2023-01-08 21:14:34] <+Pachi3000> not really
[2023-01-08 21:14:34] <DizzyWon> Yes
[2023-01-08 21:14:34] <!%Laimubot> reminder that the great Pokemon Debate of Limes memes sound really funny to get rid of the loop, why would a slugcat mod active?
[2023-01-08 21:14:34] <+PKUltraYT> Not really
[2023-01-08 21:14:35] <%Skyfairer> There kind of anti heros
[2023-01-08 21:14:36] <%+joporice> They're fun to have around
[2023-01-08 21:14:36] <%$EPee_Em> Nothing changed.
[2023-01-08 21:14:36] <%FIight_of_Icarus> They're comic relief
[2023-01-08 21:14:36] <%RebeccaHeegaard> Yeah, they still want Pikachu
[2023-01-08 21:14:36] <%+ubermanthehutt> In the manga there is a character who got a PhD when they were like 8 limesSmug
[2023-01-08 21:14:37] <%chromapon> there was one episide a while back where they were against the actual Team Rocket which was cool @Limealicious
[2023-01-08 21:14:40] <CryZe92> no they were cheering for him in the final tournament
[2023-01-08 21:14:40] <%+jakebob5557> Every once in a while they still do something bad but fail spectacularly at it
[2023-01-08 21:14:40] <%SoulTea> have they ever been?
[2023-01-08 21:14:42] <+vincentvangoatt> By definition only from what I hear
[2023-01-08 21:14:43] <%+mingo1426> They're like Wario & Waluigi
[2023-01-08 21:14:46] <samiam1616> They were always sort of the comic relief villains
[2023-01-08 21:14:48] <%Despayeeto777> they are antagonists but not evil
[2023-01-08 21:14:49] <thisisthenam> they gave ash a gift basket when he won the league
[2023-01-08 21:14:50] <%$Flammadeus> they are "untagonists"
[2023-01-08 21:14:50] <%FIight_of_Icarus> STILL been after that poor kid's Pikachu
[2023-01-08 21:14:54] <%Mortal_Quinn> @Laimubot so true NODDERS
[2023-01-08 21:14:55] <%dinnydanny777> Did Ghetsis still lock a child in his room until he became a teenager in the anime limesYikes
[2023-01-08 21:14:55] <danaeSignal> antagafriends
[2023-01-08 21:14:56] <nickjaquez26> They antagonists in the same way a bully character is one
[2023-01-08 21:14:59] <+Pachi3000> they are TECHNICALLY antagonists
[2023-01-08 21:15:00] <%OneManAgainstheOdds> no they're just the show's running gag and source of plot. they're a G-rated Calendarmen
[2023-01-08 21:15:02] <%kirby23590> limesSmug Heh
[2023-01-08 21:15:03] <teefpal> They're wacky guys who try to steal pokemon, but they're low tier in terms of an actual threat

[2023-01-08 22:43:54] <%Mortal_Quinn> And here we are!
[2023-01-08 22:43:55] <+Dozyderp> well depending on how long turo has been dead, he could have been dead for most of Arvens life
