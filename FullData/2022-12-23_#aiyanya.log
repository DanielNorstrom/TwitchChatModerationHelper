[2022-12-23 11:58:33] <!%+The_Haytch> No, because to create tea the immersed is the throwaway, hotdog is the subject and the water is a byproduct

[2022-12-23 12:36:55] <%+RisellSnowcrest> so having the timers does make them a little easier but end of the day its so minor haha

[2022-12-23 12:38:33] <!%LulubyVT> i honestly see it as timing stuff better

[2022-12-23 13:30:40] <@%+operatorviera> Hey guys, did you know that in terms of male human and female Vtuber breeding, MiyaMewrilee is the most compatible Vtuber for humans? Not only are they in the degen egg group, which is mostly comprised of mammals, MiyaMewrilee are an average of 5”7’ tall and 130 pounds, this means they’re large enough to be able handle human dicks, and with their impressive Base Stats for HP and access to VerRaise, you can be rough with one.

[2022-12-23 13:34:44] <@%MiyaMewrilee> There was a number debuff on him too like nidstenion towers
