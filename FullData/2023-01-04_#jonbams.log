[2023-01-04 01:20:41] <@%^Nightbot> Jon is making a lot of builds in one area and designing it to look like a kids play area.  bamYes   We have built a Missile that will hold a manual tree farm and are now making a silo down to bedrock under it.  bamHH   The missile is 175 blocks tall and will look like it is mid-launch out of the silo.

[2023-01-04 17:30:43] <%Danoc812> The Centennial Light is the world's longest-lasting light bulb, burning since 1901, and almost never turned off. It is located at 4550 East Avenue, Livermore, California, and maintained by the Livermore-Pleasanton Fire Department.
[2023-01-04 17:30:44] <%+Jon_Bams_Left_Ball> It's the type of filliment that's used in it

[2023-01-04 17:31:05] <FrogFeathers0> When light bulbs were invented they lasted 4000 hours they realized they couldn’t sell as much so they made it mandatory to make them last 1000 hours only
[2023-01-04 17:31:15] <InflatableSmells> Let’s just use candles
[2023-01-04 17:31:21] <ShionSinX> like why cant they put some stronger metal thing in the bulbs?

[2023-01-04 18:21:25] <%ktorn_> "Leck mich im Arsch" is a scatological German-language canon by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. The title translates to "Lick me in the arse" in English. The song is set to the tune of the French folk song "Ah! vous dirai-je, Maman," which is better known as the melody for the children's song "Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star."  The lyrics of "Leck mich im Arsch" are vulgar and sexually explicit, and the song is not considered to be one of Mozart's more serious compositions. Cheer100 Cheer100

[2023-01-04 18:41:36] <+skittle620> CTE is the major issue the NFL sucked at handling...especially when they dismissed one of those studies a while back to really show correlation

[2023-01-04 18:42:32] <%$ruthlessrellik> Qustion though, why did they have him on the field for 9 minutes instead of in an ambulance faster? 9 minutes should have had him in the hospital. Don't they have ambulances like right at the tunnel?
[2023-01-04 18:42:39] <%TheRJaBee> CPR should of been pumping the blood? Right?

[2023-01-04 18:42:44] <%$SamTheCellist> Cheer200 call me crazy, but i'd really like it if people simply looked at this incident in a vacuum. stop trying to connect the lines to other things, or comparing, contrasting, pro and conning all of the blah blah blah. stop blaming, stop creating noise. its sad and scary. my take, and maybe not a good one.
[2023-01-04 18:42:49] <%+biggirlxoxoxo> cpr is manually pumping the heart
[2023-01-04 18:42:53] <%Danoc812> too much money involved to not play
[2023-01-04 18:42:55] <+skittle620> it depends how he reacts when he awakes from his coma and is stable again
