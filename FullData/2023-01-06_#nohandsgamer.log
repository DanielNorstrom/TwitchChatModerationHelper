[2023-01-06 00:49:37] <baldguyfromcrank> You think they would ever actually increase the life limit? Realistically
[2023-01-06 00:50:01] <%JonsyBones> Twitch has been a poopy mess today. Thoughts?
[2023-01-06 00:50:03] <%+Xeath5> they made decks go to 20 mana
[2023-01-06 00:50:03] <+reaperonetho> they already did it with dk
[2023-01-06 00:50:24] <jpalermo> Predicting the future is easy. It’s being correct that’s hard…

[2023-01-06 00:50:46] <baldguyfromcrank> Reddit claims the game is a dead wasteland, and the most boring it’s ever been. Was on there for 5 minutes and got super depressed.

[2023-01-06 00:50:58] <woodhead81> do you think they will ever replace decks with just 1 giant card?
[2023-01-06 00:51:02] <+reaperonetho> but reddit sucks
[2023-01-06 00:51:09] <%+Xeath5> we dont even have numbers
[2023-01-06 00:51:12] <%+Xeath5> so how do we know
[2023-01-06 00:51:25] <Bilwitz> if you went by reddit wild would be the most popular game mode

[2023-01-06 00:52:57] <+cinnamonchair> you try svalna priest nohands?
[2023-01-06 00:53:24] <Legendary_Anna> invincible isnt that good in this deck?
[2023-01-06 00:53:30] <baldguyfromcrank> Honestly.. VS always says every deck but the super top tier decks are trash though.
[2023-01-06 00:53:40] <+reaperonetho> honeslly control priest is the most boring thing in the game so i'm not so sad that it's bad, the last game of the world championship was sleeping simulation because of the priest mirror
[2023-01-06 00:53:50] <%+helix_sky> theres just different meta at different ranks of ladder
[2023-01-06 00:53:51] <Bilwitz> invincible acts as like a finisher on turn 12
[2023-01-06 00:53:55] <lightfreeze_hs> vs syndicate does kinda makes sense, tbh priest would be fine if the meta wasn't so much full of scam
[2023-01-06 00:53:56] <%+Xeath5> ??
[2023-01-06 00:53:56] <Bilwitz> games end on turn 6 so
[2023-01-06 00:54:00] <%+Xeath5> why is the trading all the time

[2023-01-06 02:19:56] <%$Onyrius> @nohandsgamer i think you develop the soft skill of being able to maintain conversation without visual or audio feedback from your audience, which I think is good in a team based work environment

[2023-01-06 03:19:10] <%+Valistin14> Oh did they?
[2023-01-06 03:19:26] <JJJ67> it was just a worse boar priest, same draw package
[2023-01-06 03:19:41] <sanu03_> btw he's not saying "thoughts" he's just calling us thots at the end of every sentence
[2023-01-06 03:19:51] <huntstv> so hear me out here, but I think beast hunter is the best to play right now
[2023-01-06 03:20:12] <grimBleeper> nice honest deck that you can take home to your parents
[2023-01-06 03:20:22] <%+helix_sky> wait what
[2023-01-06 03:20:24] <%+helix_sky> lol
[2023-01-06 03:20:27] <+filorosa22> why not also run the quest in this deck, it adds one wincon and discover 2 times for 1 space @nohandsgamer
[2023-01-06 03:20:37] <%+Valistin14> Good explanation lol
[2023-01-06 03:20:38] <%+helix_sky> you have been feeling up on some dad bods lately?
[2023-01-06 03:20:40] <~%NoHandsGamer> !quest
[2023-01-06 03:20:40] <@^Nightbot> I took a vow to never play quest priest because it's too OP and immoral. Sorry. You can play it, but you're a bad person if you do.
[2023-01-06 03:20:42] <+filorosa22> mana*
[2023-01-06 03:20:43] <huntstv> it has a decent matchup vs quest dh, miracle rogue, thief rogue, frost dk, and spitter hunter, which seem to make up the vast majority of the ladder right now

[2023-01-06 03:21:11] <johnpiani> seu jorge
[2023-01-06 03:21:12] <%+shanevapid> I liked fenos theory that all the beast hunters spent all their dust on that deck and can’t afford to craft a new one
[2023-01-06 03:21:15] <acidnicers> How many Dad Bods have u Felt?
[2023-01-06 03:21:19] <grimBleeper> @cinnamonchair just play miracle rogue instead, that way you can try and make up the tempo from egg onmywaytoplayeggpriest
[2023-01-06 03:21:29] <%Lvl_100_Magikarp> beast hunter is fine as long as you don’t play in top legend
[2023-01-06 03:21:32] <oPatoViking> I never thought I would hear a seu jorge song on nohands stream
[2023-01-06 03:21:49] <huntstv> maybe I'm biased since a good midrange hunter deck has always been my go to in every meta where it's been viable lol
[2023-01-06 03:21:51] <+cinnamonchair> @cinnamonchair got it will do
[2023-01-06 03:22:10] <huntstv> true
[2023-01-06 03:22:30] <Lmman44> its almost as if its not the deck but the player...Hmmmmm
[2023-01-06 03:22:38] <huntstv> Looking at matchup spreads I think it is purely because the decks beast hunter is good against seem to be the most popular right now
[2023-01-06 03:22:59] VIEWERS: 1 251
[2023-01-06 03:23:04] <JJJ67> that's like any good paladin ever, top legend just scoffs at it
[2023-01-06 03:23:51] <%Lvl_100_Magikarp> the board based tempo decks just don’t translate well to high levels of play
[2023-01-06 03:24:03] <%Lvl_100_Magikarp> but they’re good to climb with
[2023-01-06 03:24:26] <%+Valistin14> Bigspell is board based tempo
[2023-01-06 03:24:34] <Bilwitz> beast hunter used to be good vs rogue
[2023-01-06 03:24:44] <Bilwitz> that was pre cocs tho
[2023-01-06 03:24:46] <!%J_Alexander_HS> rogue is a board deck

[2023-01-06 03:24:59] <huntstv> I'm not a top legen player regardless of deck, but above I gave my reasoning for why I think beast hunter is top tier viable, based off of the popularity of the decks that beast hunter has an advantage vs

[2023-01-06 03:27:18] <huntstv> same, I can usually pilot at least some decks to legend, can make some adjustments to existing decks. But every time I've tried to make a deck from scratch it's been an absolute disaster
