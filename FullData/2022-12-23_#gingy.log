[2022-12-23 16:14:02] <timblp> When you start over like this, are you actually buying another game? or is there another way to "start over"
[2022-12-23 16:14:19] <%+iitsTre_> @the_kraud I’ve heard. But you just have to make your own fun in games like these. I’m only going into my second wipe so for me learning is still fun. But I’m sure I’ll be there pretty soon. Try playing with like only SMGs this wipe or something. Give yourself a challenge
[2022-12-23 16:14:27] <%+AndrewMarkK> they are too expensive in my opinion. just giving away millions to some cheater

[2022-12-23 16:17:29] <@%+LilPoopGod> Nah I'm always happy but I like sad songs more and singing along
[2022-12-23 16:17:39] <+The_Kraud> @iitsTre_  well, i do all the quests, comming to lvl 40-50 with it, sitting on usually 40-100 Mio Rubles.... Can go in however i want..... What am i going in for? PVP? its all the same after so many years... i mean, i played the game, while we could loot in offline raids to make money, where you could only go to Factory and Customs.... with the Godly Sniperscavs, to headshot you with their shotguns 100m away, but if they dont see you? run up from the back and whack em with the melee XD
[2022-12-23 16:17:51] <%aEnby> It's good to feel emotions
[2022-12-23 16:17:56] <%DannySpaz> yes it does, its sad, but brings to mind good memories, or bad
[2022-12-23 16:17:58] <%+iitsTre_> We need some Sara Bareilles in this bish 😂
[2022-12-23 16:18:02] <@%+LilPoopGod> its easier to connect to sad songs

[2022-12-23 16:18:21] <prodigyak> I think it also just comes with age and experience.  Like you can relate to it more because you've lived through some shit.
[2022-12-23 16:18:21] <frightsyy> i could once empathize with the sad song and listening to them now makes me feel empowered

[2022-12-23 16:43:33] <%skuld89> I'd say they are doing events to test things and collect data
[2022-12-23 16:43:35] <mas0nd1xon> my first wipe was the Christmas eve that they sprung it on us
[2022-12-23 16:43:44] <@%TrillOG_> i got tarky re downloaded and im ready for pain
[2022-12-23 16:43:54] <JackaldotJ> I hope you're right, itching so bad to play again but this previous wipe I don't know anyone who played it. Minus you I guess
[2022-12-23 16:43:57] <+RLF3911> They let their 'B' team come up with these events for sure
[2022-12-23 16:43:59] <zxrvr> how much notice they usualy give for wipe
[2022-12-23 16:44:00] <zxrvr> ??
[2022-12-23 16:44:04] <+moule___frite> Street is just not ready yet that's why we get so many shitty events
[2022-12-23 16:44:09] <@%+jimmiedrum> I'm going to wait and do full reimbursement s

[2022-12-23 16:44:32] <%BeoArmsWar> I think one reason people want to know when wipe is, is so they can get time off from work etc..
[2022-12-23 16:44:45] <@%TrillOG_> @jimmiedrum i did but scared to clikc play monkaX
[2022-12-23 16:44:52] <Clasten72> GINGY,,,, Hello how are you feeling today?? hows raids goin
[2022-12-23 16:45:10] <+oldmanhandsss> well most people are getting time off now and i believe that is why they are stressing it
[2022-12-23 16:45:13] <JackaldotJ> So their open world announcement, was that planned directly after streets?

[2022-12-23 17:00:51] <%$Dale_B0203> i find beer on customs but not that much of it, maybe a bottle every 3 or 4 hours
[2022-12-23 17:01:00] <+Nephilimator> Are you glasses prescription or just wearing to block blue light?

[2022-12-23 17:02:04] <%+douginercootttv> Lol you created a wipe for yourself?
[2022-12-23 17:02:06] <+RLF3911> its literally just guessing
[2022-12-23 17:02:13] <SpaceToasti> I’m going bear this wipe

[2022-12-23 17:02:18] <%+illuminist619> drops will be 1 week after wipe
[2022-12-23 17:02:24] <%0x4ndy> what drops ?
[2022-12-23 17:02:30] <@%TrillOG_> drops were really simple stuff last time
[2022-12-23 17:02:30] <SpaceToasti> They’ve done drops like a week after wipes everytime tho
[2022-12-23 17:02:36] <@%TrillOG_> like a water filter
[2022-12-23 17:02:36] <SpaceToasti> It’s like a docs case
[2022-12-23 17:02:40] <Oecleus> makes no sense to do the drops prewipe though either
[2022-12-23 17:02:43] <%skuld89> depends on the drops
[2022-12-23 17:02:53] <sinxstxr> why would they give s drops before the wipe?
[2022-12-23 17:02:54] <%electricshock7> Critical error 1502 is killing me on flea
[2022-12-23 17:03:18] <+hydraneet> can't wait for wipe and drops at the same time, I want my servers to be perma crashing
[2022-12-23 17:03:21] <+RLF3911> Theres always a wipe coming, makes no difference when they do drops
[2022-12-23 17:03:23] <Manic_Marc> airdrops or something im missing

[2022-12-23 17:04:21] <+Blex_Qc> Drops shouldn't be a thing imo, give us cosmetic instead

[2022-12-23 17:04:22] <%electricshock7> How Young is Gingy turning?
[2022-12-23 17:04:31] <Vega_Archer> Did we talk about the Tarkov tweet yet?
[2022-12-23 17:04:54] <SpaceToasti> Drops are harmless
[2022-12-23 17:05:05] <%xNymia> @Vega_Archer Itll be christmas event, only 1h and no mention of wipe. Wipe patch will likely be a 6+ hr one
[2022-12-23 17:05:06] <+Mystic01010> If you think that way of drops, whats ur imput on the Xmas gift they give us?
[2022-12-23 17:05:06] <xSHNOWDENx> @Vega_Archer what tweet ?
[2022-12-23 17:05:15] <%Crawlern> Just had 12 scavs down in the cage bunkers.
[2022-12-23 17:05:18] <+RLF3911> 600 rounds of BP coming in drops
[2022-12-23 17:05:19] <darkstxr45> What are the items usually for drops
[2022-12-23 17:05:20] <Demon_of_the_Crows> personally i wish the drops were account-permanent cosmetics. nothing game-changing, just a cool shirt or hat or something that we cant lose
[2022-12-23 17:05:24] <+0x1ef7> so guess wipe is tomorrow then

[2022-12-23 17:05:35] <%skuld89> the most noticable drop they did was the ash-12
[2022-12-23 17:05:36] <+Nephilimator> Most times I 24/7 twitch for drops events and about the BEST item I have ever got was maybe an injector case? Most the time its junk.

[2022-12-23 17:06:24] <%electricshock7> It's like that with everything in this world. People are just bored with their lives.
[2022-12-23 17:06:41] <+Nephilimator> How did it ruin early game though, the drops are normally 'ehhh'
[2022-12-23 17:06:43] <justoffwork> drops right after wule bull

[2022-12-23 17:07:21] <+0x1ef7> @0x1ef7 why not, tweet looks like it
[2022-12-23 17:07:30] <%xNymia> putting bp in an unmodded akm is just gonna end with you missing everything
[2022-12-23 17:07:30] <Heir_to_throne3> The BP wasnt drops anyways. It was the Christmas Gift

[2022-12-23 19:43:10] <@%XVLNGHOST> but honestly nobody knows
[2022-12-23 19:43:12] <szeretemnetherbarbiit> wipe is on dec 26 guys
[2022-12-23 19:43:31] <+Evi1mojo> BFG changed there minds no wipe coming

[2022-12-23 19:43:36] <+george8bit> streamers know.
[2022-12-23 19:43:37] <@%XVLNGHOST> so I guess technically it could be but imo not likely since its only down for an hour vs like 3-5 @Kube_v2
[2022-12-23 19:43:49] <+george8bit> they know when their drops start.
[2022-12-23 19:43:52] <%$Dale_B0203> might be tagilla

[2022-12-23 22:18:00] <%Mess1as> @2L33Zy I still think that
[2022-12-23 22:18:03] <@%+tobiassolem> The next drops event starts December 29. It makes little sense to have drops just before a wipe.
[2022-12-23 22:18:07] <+waynehaworth> ugh
[2022-12-23 22:18:11] <@%+2L33Zy> @KONIUX27v2 LUL LUL
