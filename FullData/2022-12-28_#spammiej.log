[2022-12-28 16:32:11] <+Kevz95> I found this on google...? "Hi, I'm italian and "bingo bongo" here it's a (pretty uncommon ) racial slur, it's like I call someone an ape/ dumb/uncivilized/ indigenous and is addressed to black people. It's less offensive than the N word but still insulting."
[2022-12-28 16:32:18] <%azteca70> oh nice it has levels

Check out !medals to see the most difficult author medals in the campaign and my personal best on !midori - Before you ask, https://www.author-tracker.com uses a different medal for Midori compared to the ingame one. The goal is to just gather the available ones slow and steadily.

Check out !medals to see the most difficult author medals in the campaign and my personal best on !midori - Before you ask, https://www.author-tracker.com uses a different medal for Midori compared to the ingame one. The goal is to just gather the available ones slow and steadily.

[2022-12-28 18:48:24] <%+Victor1502Games> but it looks like a fun map right?
[2022-12-28 18:48:51] <%+MaheTM> for me the lokogz_ map is the least fun you still have to do
[2022-12-28 18:49:02] <%ThatRei> true, no one played it for 3 months
[2022-12-28 18:49:06] <IntaxTM> this map is one of my overall favorites in terms of enjoyability this year YEP
[2022-12-28 18:49:17] <%TrenboloneAbuser> that map is too stressful
[2022-12-28 18:49:37] <%Kriidy> little dings on this map make it very annoying to hunt

[2022-12-28 19:20:29] <+jviyGishmoigen> costco is a store that specializes in bulk sale
[2022-12-28 19:20:41] <PDS_Yourse1f> Costco is like WalMart on steroids
[2022-12-28 19:20:54] <@%Kem_> @SRK_____ idk, maybe you have smth like PROMO or MERE stores around
[2022-12-28 19:20:57] <+jviyGishmoigen> they also have a pharmacy and inoculation center. as well as an eye center
[2022-12-28 19:20:57] <Talanthalos> That is Mosso? Maybe I'm going deaf... Could not recognize
[2022-12-28 19:21:19] <SRK_____> @PDS_Yourse1f i am giga clueless not too sure what walmart is

[2022-12-28 19:21:29] <Iceman___S> why are you talking about american stores
[2022-12-28 19:21:42] <SRK_____> @Kem_ like like maxima ?
[2022-12-28 19:21:45] <+Kevz95> @Talanthalos definitely mosso
[2022-12-28 19:22:04] <+jviyGishmoigen> because you can get glasses for way cheaper at costco versus an eye center somewhere else @Iceman___S
[2022-12-28 19:22:20] <@%Kem_> @SRK_____ think maxima size, but you buy everything in bulk, like packs of water, etc.
