[2023-01-09 13:41:17] <aceofspadez42> Yes, you will end up accidentally creating false memories at times because the images your brain creates are so real. Hyperphantasics can have issues telling if the dreams they had weeks ago were a dream or was real (assuming the contents were somewhat feasible).
