[2022-12-30 03:04:59] <+jordand198> Snipe was bouncing around Halo teams tbf, that’s actually a fact
[2022-12-30 03:05:07] <bottledtea> @pseudosealion11 i mean... they still got 1st pro league.. so it kinda works
[2022-12-30 03:05:12] <%pray4jeremy> Didnt he play for two teams
[2022-12-30 03:05:14] <Harper2020> what u think of zach , mac and chaotic as a team ?
[2022-12-30 03:05:22] <ShoCopes> "hal is not good" 1st in Pro League  lmao
[2022-12-30 03:05:34] <%pray4jeremy> Or are you talking about pre-apex halo
[2022-12-30 03:05:36] <tom12345674> Did graceful fully igl Mac and naughty at lan?
[2022-12-30 03:05:38] <+jordand198> Zach and Mac butted heads, no way
[2022-12-30 03:05:39] <%sau5ages> @Harper2020 they would just shout
[2022-12-30 03:05:51] <@%+foremostwolf> @tom12345674 it was kind of co-igl with mac
[2022-12-30 03:06:02] <Harper2020> im sure mac would listen to zach no ?
[2022-12-30 03:06:04] <+pseudosealion11> I’d pay to see his teammates who are incredible submissive stand up in pro league and smoke the dude with hands. Just ktfo
[2022-12-30 03:06:09] <Harper2020> hes clearly the igl

[2022-12-30 03:08:14] <+pseudosealion11> If it was me i legit would’ve smoked the dude by now. I get the passion but there’s no need to say you fn dumba and just keep going
[2022-12-30 03:08:18] <tom12345674> What’s crazy is snipe didn’t know slurp and slurp was macs vouch. The contracts make shit messy

[2022-12-30 03:27:17] <Omni35> @FrostyThump controller players usually play the slayer role in comp because a controller is a worse input device and requires more concentration and aim assist to be be on par with mouse and keyboard.

[2022-12-30 03:29:16] <Omni35> it's not a weird take every pro agrees mouse and keyboad is a better overall input device
[2022-12-30 03:29:22] <%opheimer> controller is worse but the game helps you aiming
[2022-12-30 03:29:31] <Omni35> people are switching to controller so the game can aim for them
[2022-12-30 03:29:39] <%opheimer> massive L that aim assist is even allowed in competitive

[2022-12-30 04:21:35] <birdoturdo> Zach what do you consider to be a good Apex salary?
[2022-12-30 04:22:15] <murph4031> @fanaite curious about this too. Wondering what an average pro salary is.
[2022-12-30 04:22:21] <messimaxx19> Doesn’t hal have a 2.5 mil net worth ?👀
[2022-12-30 04:22:44] <VIEWah> @FAnaite that would be counterproductive getting his next contract
[2022-12-30 04:22:47] <+jordand198> Taxi said the average apex pro salary is 2k a month a while ago. Dunno how credible Taxi is though lol
[2022-12-30 04:22:57] <addisnow> Not talking about your salary benefits the employer
[2022-12-30 04:22:58] <VIEWah> he can - he just shouldn't.

[2022-12-30 18:58:54] <+CPatRan> @camo2525 he could but he would have to go through challengers at this point
[2022-12-30 18:59:23] <camo2525> @yayorozu well i know u can but i was more wondering like what the rules are...does it force you to start from challenger series? i know he could sign with an established team
[2022-12-30 18:59:31] <tripodz_4thewin> Zack gent and deeds would be crazy cause they would actually listen to zack but that’s nicks boys that’s not going to happen
