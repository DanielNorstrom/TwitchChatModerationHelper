[2022-12-28 00:00:10] <%Pgh__chill> I mean I have games that I could play but I usually just play the same ones. It’s weird because I always tell my self “play this game” but it never happens

[2022-12-28 02:18:08] <Dr_Cry> Valheim is a good time but its a fat time sink
[2022-12-28 02:18:12] <+MysticAarrgg> Sims 4 is free and Aleks still can't afford to give Art their birthday wish
[2022-12-28 02:18:17] <%ricebunnixxiv> how dare he treat you like that on YOUR birthday art
[2022-12-28 02:18:19] <!%RealOrMagic> like GTA 5 V?

[2022-12-28 02:18:23] <%TannshusOrtoma> V Rising announced a content patch coming in months

[2022-12-28 02:18:35] <%kiba592> when Valheim tho
[2022-12-28 02:18:42] <@%AttackOnCoffee> V Rising was so good on release but there wasn't enough content to warrant the price imo
[2022-12-28 02:19:03] <@%AttackOnCoffee> Sick of game devs doing this shit :)
[2022-12-28 02:19:11] <Dr_Cry> Darktide still crashes like constantly for me

[2022-12-28 02:20:07] <GhostyGang_> @Dr_Cry when you launch the game in the launcher lower cpu cores to 14 and it will fix the crashing issue
[2022-12-28 02:20:09] <+NuFahrenheit> Good gameplay but bad mtx
[2022-12-28 02:20:13] <%TannshusOrtoma> I agree coffee. They're finally adding the ability to build multiple story buildings
[2022-12-28 02:20:15] <+Doplaar> Tech issues I think
[2022-12-28 02:20:25] <%KeepItFraiche> I’m still waiting for that dark tide rant aleks mentioned like a month ago
[2022-12-28 02:20:29] <Indelacio_co_uk> darktide is really about who you're playing it with whether it's fun
[2022-12-28 02:20:33] <@%AttackOnCoffee> @TannshusOrtoma SO much potential with that game
[2022-12-28 02:20:37] <+MysticAarrgg> Tech Issues and MTX seem to be the biggest issues
[2022-12-28 02:20:38] <Dr_Cry> @Dr_Cry Heck, I'll try it.
