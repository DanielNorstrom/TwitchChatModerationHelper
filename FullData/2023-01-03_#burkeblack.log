[2023-01-03 04:39:28] <@%+Nikolai_Von_Imhof> @GetRadicalDude I mean, most people can't do sustain for that long. LUL The one thing I've been doing, is after a walk start with 10 seconds, but 10 seconds before end of walk/job, run at a higher speed, if fine for 10 seconds, add another 10. Keep doing it until it is too hard. Keep at the higher speed and go until that is easy, add 10 more seconds./

[2023-01-03 08:22:30] <%+prfella> @CyberAilurus technically speaking the units their controlling are seperate from the actual player controlling them, because these units can die, and you can get new ones, would be akward if the actual player died burkeS

[2023-01-03 10:41:27] <%Spidersfury> Books books books, stop harping on the damn books lol. You think every movie / series has to be based on the books? Shows part ways with what you think is canon. Marvel has shown that lmao
[2023-01-03 10:42:02] <funsiesbuns> that discussion will never cease to exist @Spidersfury

[2023-01-03 10:42:10] <Luckyguerilla> Right, do your own thing if you have so many ideas that you end up changing the core of the source material. And that is fine
[2023-01-03 10:42:22] <%Spidersfury> @funsiesbuns nor will arguments
[2023-01-03 10:42:40] <+Ed_1878> @Spidersfury Then call it...The Crapper rather than The Witcher, if you claim the IP, it should follow the IP lore
[2023-01-03 10:42:41] <+WantedOne> @Spidersfury marvel has the out of multiverse. dont call it witcher if it has nothing but the name tied to it
[2023-01-03 10:42:54] <%Spidersfury> LUL

[2023-01-03 10:43:25] <%Linvxx> Marvel went the comedy route and tbh its killing the movies. In my opinion.
[2023-01-03 10:43:55] <%+ScrubbishDM> @Linvxx Phase 3 was complete trash, because of the same lazy writing style.
[2023-01-03 10:43:55] <%+spark____> I mean if you dont respect the source material youll end up making a very lack luster story thats been proven coutnless times
[2023-01-03 10:44:18] <funsiesbuns> as opposed to the dark and gritty route that dc took @Linvxx ? I would say its the best choice
[2023-01-03 10:44:43] <%Spidersfury> "Canon is key!" - Meanwhile, Marvel and DC - REALLY? Look how much money we make with new writers, WOO! People like it! lol
[2023-01-03 10:44:53] <%+ScrubbishDM> yes phase 4 sry
[2023-01-03 10:44:55] <%BudaKhan> @funsiesbuns Well, I guess it all comes down to whether or not you like seeing the world with rose colored glasses or not

[2023-01-03 10:45:02] <+MarZexious> @Spidersfury Witcher Origin is like Taking Lord of the Rings and having Sauron do the nasty with Galadriel. wait........
[2023-01-03 10:45:04] <%Linvxx> Yes, I personally would prefer a serious scene to be serious rather than comedy relief being thrown in.
[2023-01-03 10:45:07] <%gingytrucking> what wut you do o.o

[2023-01-03 10:45:53] <%BudaKhan> This whole debate on the Witcher and the rings of power. It’s all the same problem. These bastards can’t come up with nothing new.

[2023-01-03 10:46:01] <$inoooh> Imo, the cinematic universe and any other adaptions it's fine if it deviates from the lore IF it's still good despite the deviation
[2023-01-03 10:46:08] <%+spark____> lord of the rings movies  is a great example they didn't follow the source material but they base off their own creation on the source

[2023-01-03 10:47:13] <%+ScrubbishDM> deviating a little is ok. A lot of comics struggle to make sense with themselves. But witcher writers don't even like the source material

[2023-01-03 10:48:16] <%BudaKhan> The heroes are all 20 and 30 years old. Star Wars is now 30 to 40 years old. They’re not making anything new and when they do a lot of it sucks. My favorite movie in the last 10 years was Cloud Atlas. That movie had more big-name stars in it and you never heard about it than any movie I think I’ve ever known.
[2023-01-03 10:48:16] <wolfscout1950> i watched it it was not bad
[2023-01-03 10:48:20] <K1NGProphet> imma toss a coin, for sure
[2023-01-03 10:48:23] <squigbiz> Blood origin was a fun show.
[2023-01-03 10:48:34] <%Eumalan> i liked Blood Origin

[2023-01-03 10:48:36] <+Ed_1878> Season 2 of the Witcher is a grammy compared to Blood origins
[2023-01-03 10:48:37] <+MarZexious> I'm excited for Cavill produced WH40K.
[2023-01-03 10:48:41] <%+Panda_c260> I loved season 2 of the witcher, but apparently blood origin is just a bad show.
[2023-01-03 10:48:42] <%Linvxx> I likes rongs of power too
[2023-01-03 10:48:42] <%+ScrubbishDM> main witcher show is fine imo
[2023-01-03 10:48:43] <HorreC> rings of power was good
[2023-01-03 10:48:45] <+DockterMan> I liked it
[2023-01-03 10:48:46] <+WantedOne> the real question will be season 3 to see how that turns out :p

[2023-01-03 10:49:04] <$inoooh> I enjoyed Rings of Power, I thought it was fine, but definitely more fan-fictiony
[2023-01-03 10:49:08] <wolfscout1950> still need to watch it
[2023-01-03 10:49:12] <Shivalla> I liked RoP more than HotD

[2023-01-03 10:49:49] <+bert_oldo> probably, if someone has not read the books about The Witcher, he may like the Netflix series. I've known these books for over 20 years and I say the show sucks.

[2023-01-03 10:51:43] <+Revenantforge> @BurkeBlack with witcher season 2 the writers were towing the line of staying true to the lore and creating their own story. Now they know they don´t need to tow it anymore and now we have Blood origin LUL. Jaskar is shoed in in 2 scenes and begin and ending to use him for trailer
[2023-01-03 10:51:46] <%Masta_CriXus> yeh Sadge

[2023-01-03 10:52:53] <squigbiz> There is one instance that I should point out, NCIS changed leads, but did it well and the show is still fine, Also Blacklist also did it but ALSO did it well enough, I don't have much faith in Netflix to write it out well though.

[2023-01-03 10:55:08] <sshen13> @revenantforge oof ok
[2023-01-03 10:55:19] <loksmurfen> They lissen to morgoth not sauron
[2023-01-03 10:55:20] <+nascient> my god people really hate it when women have a leading role in a show they watch - if galadriel role had been elrond doing it all, then people wouldn't have a problem
[2023-01-03 10:55:24] <Luckyguerilla> They followed Morgoth
[2023-01-03 10:55:25] <Rifiru> balrogs are demons, they choke out the light, which elves live on
[2023-01-03 10:55:29] <%Linvxx> Sauron literally tricked celebrimbor into making the rings by playing nice and getting close. Very sneaky. Loki sneaky almost.
[2023-01-03 10:55:34] <%Fairlight_Excalibur> @BurkeBlack I've been doing the deepest dive into Tolkien this past couple weeks cuz of the show I'm on. I was mind blown to find that Gandalf and the Balrog are the same race LUL
[2023-01-03 10:55:47] <%+Enigmal> The Balrogs were foot soldiers of Morgoroth
[2023-01-03 10:55:48] <funsiesbuns> @nascient I swear that is not the problem for majority of people disliking rings of power
[2023-01-03 10:55:49] <%Spidersfury> Burke you cannot play this game and deal with chat right now LUL

[2023-01-03 10:55:59] <sshen13> @nascient women in leading roles are ok when they’re written right. Most of the cases they just shoehorn a leading lady just cause
[2023-01-03 10:56:02] <%+Panda_c260> and if we dip into movie series, james bond, one of the most successful franchises in history, changes lead actor every 10 years or so rooVV burke
[2023-01-03 10:56:09] <%JadeTigerPlays> Balrogs were "Demons of the old world" aka pre Morgoth
[2023-01-03 10:56:11] <+Sir_Magnetron> this is coop?
[2023-01-03 10:56:16] <+Revenantforge> @sshen13 they put jaskar in 2 scenes for him to talk about the "lore of blood origin" so he could be used in the trailer.
[2023-01-03 10:56:17] <Baldville> @Fairlight_Excalibur what show are you going on
[2023-01-03 10:56:20] <%N7Lawson> Gothmog lord of the Balrogs was more powerful than Sauron when it comes to combat
[2023-01-03 10:56:21] <wolfscout1950> then play the game

[2023-01-03 10:56:43] <sshen13> @revenantforge I thought blood origin was a long time before Witcher? How is he in it
[2023-01-03 10:56:44] <darelin83> It's really simple, when your drawing straight from lore from a brilliant author it goes well, when the show writers start trying to make their own things its most often mediocre at best
[2023-01-03 10:56:44] <%gingytrucking> yup

[2023-01-03 11:00:03] <%$WabbitRequiem> just find some 6 feet tall actors to play space marine and find some short actors for everything else , problem solved
[2023-01-03 11:00:05] <%+Panda_c260> if they did that they'd all have to be played by actors the size of the 3 people who played the mountain in game of thrones for me.
[2023-01-03 11:00:11] <squigbiz> I'm just afraid that the 40k show will be too similar to a generic sci-fi alien show. That's all I'm worried about. When adapting, you can't expect the writers to be hardcore fans.
[2023-01-03 11:00:13] <Baldville> for someone who hasnt been in the 40k universe, what is a spacemarine ?
[2023-01-03 11:00:14] <$TunnelRatXIII> Nope, the Emperor wanted to firmly establish a patriarchy.

[2023-01-03 11:02:10] <$TunnelRatXIII> Is GW "woke" for having mixed-gender armies for every other species almost?

[2023-01-03 11:02:23] <squigbiz> frankly, if they make a female space marine, make her a giant badass and give it a solid story, let's be honest, it only sucks when the character or writing is shallow.
[2023-01-03 11:02:29] <GoingGreyGaming> if you're worried about it being "woke", just don't watch it

[2023-01-03 12:17:56] <Gorebane44> the ocean isn't really water its actually just fish urine =P

[2023-01-03 12:27:46] <+MarZexious> @Gorebane44 different.  BB has RNG.  Wartales is basically by the numbers, no RNG.

[2023-01-03 12:30:55] <%+HybridMemorieZ> @BurkeBlack was watching why old warhammer ended was becos they could not copy whited orcs
[2023-01-03 12:30:55] <$Goldfish4k14> supposedly one box of Space Marines outsold that whole line FeelsBadMan
[2023-01-03 12:31:13] <+BaronBobBlitzkrieg> The reason they blew it up is because 8th edition screwed it up badly: They made a few very unpopular changes, and people left for squad-based combat games.

[2023-01-03 12:31:37] <$Goldfish4k14> they also competed against themselves with the Lord of the Rings license. Games Workshop was weird
[2023-01-03 12:31:53] <+BaronBobBlitzkrieg> GW wasn't well-managed, that's for sure.
[2023-01-03 12:31:53] <Lahndon> i thought it was copyright issues they made age of sigmar
[2023-01-03 12:31:55] <Zethuz> fantasy WH found its ideal habitat - games
[2023-01-03 12:32:12] <+BaronBobBlitzkrieg> @Lahndon Nope. They wanted to make their 40k and Sigmar models compatible.
[2023-01-03 12:32:29] <Lahndon> ah ok thanks
[2023-01-03 12:32:34] <+Sparowl> @burkeblack - One of the GW guys, Ronnie, made a game called Kings of War that is the rank and flank. It’s also model agnostic - use any models you want, as long as the base sizes are correct. I’ve been traveling around the west coast for it - lots of players.
[2023-01-03 12:32:45] <+BaronBobBlitzkrieg> Plus with the 8th edition disaster, WFB was sadly not doing well

[2023-01-03 12:33:38] <+BaronBobBlitzkrieg> To give you an idea of what happened in 8th edition: There was a rule where you could bring as many units in a squad as you could: Allowing some players to field a hundred models in a squad. Or more.
[2023-01-03 12:33:38] <+woof_bark> this could go anywhere

[2023-01-03 12:34:23] <+BaronBobBlitzkrieg> Combine that with some units' ability to attack regardless of rank position, and you'd have units that could attack a hundred times in one move.

[2023-01-03 12:59:51] <Baldville> imagine a wartale taking place in starwars setting
[2023-01-03 12:59:54] <Saturn0O> i resonate more with star wars then with warhammer but i know you like it ofc
[2023-01-03 12:59:57] <+squizm> Epic campaign with friends battling over the system, orbit, and locations. Man, what a blast that would be.
[2023-01-03 13:00:03] <%Laser_SeQ> this sounds like Star Trek..that chess game in multiple dimensions
[2023-01-03 13:00:08] <DoomGuyFieri> These kinds of games are what spawned D&D back in the late 60s and early 70s, so it'd be interesting to use one of the Star Wars tabletop rpgs to influence stuff in the big game.
[2023-01-03 13:00:11] <Saturn0O> that sounds so siick

[2023-01-03 13:31:52] <GreyCrow_CZ> is there a blood mode?
[2023-01-03 13:32:09] <%Fairlight_Excalibur> My only time playing this game, there was one veteran player controlling Germany and all the rest of us were noobs. He occupied every ocean space with submarines and we didn't know how to get rid of them so he monopolized most of the map and killed us all fairKEK
[2023-01-03 13:32:52] <macrofusion> What is "IPC"?
[2023-01-03 13:33:16] <@%+Aeovanti> Industrial?
[2023-01-03 13:33:16] <angraham85> industrial production credit or something
[2023-01-03 13:33:38] <brutal_losers> industrial production capacity?

[2023-01-03 13:33:54] <angraham85> That sounds better
[2023-01-03 13:33:57] <macrofusion> It is not even on Wikipedia.
[2023-01-03 13:34:03] <melodiousthonkvi> Probably like accumulating points like Risk?

[2023-01-03 13:36:07] <alerik66> someone is pissed LUL
[2023-01-03 13:36:27] <aeyolius> Can tanks still blitz 2 spaces?

[2023-01-03 13:38:29] <rosecroixx> there is a freeware program called TripleA that lets you play Axis and Allies rules with alot of mods, like LOTR etc
[2023-01-03 13:39:41] VIEWERS: 1 954
[2023-01-03 13:39:55] <rosecroixx> what is US doing?
[2023-01-03 13:40:05] <melodiousthonkvi> So coastal areas have advantages over landlocked areas? Or does land also have something similar?
[2023-01-03 13:40:21] <@%+Aeovanti> They generally are battleing Japan in this game
[2023-01-03 13:41:09] <aeyolius> Correct
[2023-01-03 13:41:17] <rosecroixx> Battleships can bombard when invading sea->land, but not die in the battle, so you can invade with 1 unit and bombard with 4 battleships for example
[2023-01-03 13:41:40] <rosecroixx> for long attiration wars

[2023-01-03 13:43:05] <aeyolius> Yeah, the game is on sale at the moment on steam
[2023-01-03 13:43:36] <+hangeroner> classic game, spent many a day in my childhood playing the board game version.
[2023-01-03 13:43:36] <@%+Aeovanti> Not uncommon to use notepads in the board game version

[2023-01-03 13:45:04] <%Fairlight_Excalibur> I'd play this, sure, but it's gonna be a long game and we'd need some other committed players lol
[2023-01-03 13:45:19] <@%+dawneylee> true
[2023-01-03 13:45:19] <aeyolius> I remember in the old computer game that Japan always did Pearl Harbor LUL
[2023-01-03 13:45:40] <wolfscout1950> griimz maybe

[2023-01-03 13:45:47] <%Fairlight_Excalibur> I think after last time we will be hard pressed to bait Grimmmz/Anthony into another strategy night LUL
[2023-01-03 13:46:03] <aeyolius> 2 players would be enough, 1 the axis and 1 the allies
[2023-01-03 13:46:08] <melodiousthonkvi> If Pops gets into this, another game to progress to is Twilight Struggle set in the Cold War…
[2023-01-03 13:46:14] <+Scorpio1401> Wouldn't this be pretty similar to the Total War Warhammer campaign you had? Or would this be even longer than that?
[2023-01-03 13:46:34] <Purple_Gems> good night byebye
