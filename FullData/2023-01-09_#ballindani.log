[2023-01-09 16:53:58] <!%Romanthony> Also Fujinon MK 18-55mm T2 this was the camera they used apprently.
[2023-01-09 16:53:59] <%zornamix> ITS ALWAYS THE WIDOWS AND ANAS
[2023-01-09 16:54:12] <!%Romanthony> "We shot 90% of the movie on the MK18-55mm T2. 9. In the world of 3D you get much more sense of depth if you shoot wider. Russell Carpenter literally says they shot 90% of the movie using the Fujinon MK 18-55mm T2."
[2023-01-09 16:54:31] <%AWildKumaCub> that's a lot of money but I'm sure it was worth it
[2023-01-09 16:55:11] <!%Romanthony> Well the films budget was $250 Million I believe
