[2023-01-08 16:33:02] <+ClarkHELLSCREAM> Not sure if it's the way to go
[2023-01-08 16:33:05] <Fudov> nerfing atalor is like nerfign chool teacher
[2023-01-08 16:33:08] <!%its_timelord> hello there fenoRB 7
[2023-01-08 16:33:09] <Fudov> makes no sense i my opnion
[2023-01-08 16:33:22] <NoneDark> i would rather play vs pre nerf sire then astalor
[2023-01-08 16:33:24] <!%molino_hs> I agree with fudov on this one
[2023-01-08 16:33:39] <ambdoexious> remove astalor :D
[2023-01-08 16:33:43] <newbieplays> what if You change the battlecry with the manathrist???
[2023-01-08 16:33:44] <EloGiggIe> i do not want to deal with step astalor untill rotation
[2023-01-08 16:33:46] <%AotC_> yeah astalor is just a really good card, isnt it shadowstep + astalor we're actually talking about
[2023-01-08 16:33:48] <%KakarotIsDead> if they nerf the healing from dh , that deck is dead
[2023-01-08 16:33:50] <!%molino_hs> I think astalor will eventually be changed but it doesn't need to be now
[2023-01-08 16:33:56] <%Xeath5> i thought we are past pretending we dont know why they nerf popular cards
[2023-01-08 16:34:00] <@%^StreamElements> Follow Feno on Twitter: https://twitter.com/FenoHS
[2023-01-08 16:34:06] <%ell_papito> At least babyrages will be pleased because they nerfed astalor OK
[2023-01-08 16:34:07] <+Ju2Crane> nerf shadowstep, problem solved
[2023-01-08 16:34:27] <$furrrrrrrret> nerfing neutral cards is cringe
[2023-01-08 16:34:28] <babyyshaark_> im scared astalor can lead to shadowstep nerf
[2023-01-08 16:34:32] <di3hard97> the problem is the amount of astalor per game, it is stupid
[2023-01-08 16:34:32] <ambdoexious> i do want it unplayable
[2023-01-08 16:34:36] <%Demobalderes> Astalor is only broken in 2 decks and it's because of 2 other cards (shadowstep and anub) :) so
[2023-01-08 16:34:46] <ambdoexious> op neutral legendaries are ran in every deck
[2023-01-08 16:34:46] <%Manja9070> it's the card with most value atm
[2023-01-08 16:34:54] <hello4453> it's kinda way too strong right now, easily fits in every deck

[2023-01-08 16:35:12] <newbieplays> i would swap the battlecries with the manathrists
[2023-01-08 16:35:13] <cizuss> astalor will be nerfed the same way dr boom was nerfed
[2023-01-08 16:35:15] <%Manja9070> if it's official, skip

[2023-01-08 18:57:13] <SmokeBuddha> @inquisitor1661 another example is in wild when you play secret passage, it doesnt copy the passage

[2023-01-08 19:02:21] <%Demobalderes> Garrote rogue was MEGA nuts and very hard
[2023-01-08 19:02:27] <%Demobalderes> But that's almost the only one
[2023-01-08 19:02:29] <dalitzking> bc 90% of people killed themselves
[2023-01-08 19:02:35] <secondbonsai> at the same time i bet the win rate for boar priest varies wildly depending on player's skill
