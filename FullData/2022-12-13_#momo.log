[2022-12-13 02:33:42] <Fynagle> You go big or go home, and Kratos NEVER goes home...

[2022-12-13 02:40:01] <Yusdraek> are we also going to watch god of war for ps4?
[2022-12-13 02:40:01] <cyborgsamuraicowboyfanboy> The Ares illusion scene, for Sure. His delivery of the line "Not Again" is fucking HEARTWRENCHING

[2022-12-13 02:40:44] <%Dougdot> My favorite line is when he's screaming ZEEEUUUUUUUSSSS

[2022-12-13 02:45:04] <@%Heavyfoot> @shewtrr Yes, but she wanted the backstory first

And he proceeds to beat the shit out of in order to progress towards saving his brother. It also leads to one of the funniest achievements/Dark jokes in the entire series (or in any game period) called "Inner-Child Abuse" 💀💀💀

[2022-12-13 03:14:53] <%Fox_Fawkes> Even Triton is cooler than Zeus, and Zeus is his uncle
[2022-12-13 03:14:54] <%$Arclock46> Poseidon has always been cooler OMEGALUL
[2022-12-13 03:14:55] <%+Crona_Steingate> everyone's cooler than Zeus
[2022-12-13 03:14:55] <Fynagle> Even in Hades Poseidon has better boons than Zeus.
[2022-12-13 03:14:59] <+dawubbz> bc poseidon didn't get viciously stabbed in the last game?
[2022-12-13 03:15:00] <xGilford> Wasn't Hades the eldest?
[2022-12-13 03:15:01] <impiledhades> Ha! Wake. Like a boat.
[2022-12-13 03:15:04] <%judgment37> The vocal-effect on that water form is sick
[2022-12-13 03:15:05] <%CloverTheCherub> Poseidon is canonically the monster fucker of Greek mythology
[2022-12-13 03:15:16] <Probab1e> Zeus is the asshole that would only work on the group project if they got to lead.
[2022-12-13 03:15:21] <+omegahawks> @momo aren’t you in hades 2 lol
[2022-12-13 03:15:21] <+malthepal4071> Wait no I think Hades is the eldest, Poseidon is the second
[2022-12-13 03:15:23] <impiledhades> Spidermaning it.
[2022-12-13 03:15:24] <Superbatflash84> Hades is the oldest brother
[2022-12-13 03:15:26] <JornNightmane> I thought she said "Talk to my hand" mrbrunGiggle
[2022-12-13 03:15:30] <tarkxt> hades deserved none of this
[2022-12-13 03:15:31] <LazySamurai> Hades got a bad deal
[2022-12-13 03:15:36] <dragonfriend7738> Zeus is simultaneously the younger and oldest brother
[2022-12-13 03:15:39] <%WolferZerotheDarkOne> Yes. Hades was the first born and he gets the underworld xD
[2022-12-13 03:15:44] <Fynagle> Zeus is the youngest, he was the last of Rhea's kids to be born.
[2022-12-13 03:15:45] <+ARavingRaccoon> Hades? Cucked? The man has a wife he spends time with
[2022-12-13 03:15:45] <+malthepal4071> Hades got the short end
[2022-12-13 03:15:45] <%Dougdot> @Strykur ironically in greek lore, hades is the most neutral if not more sympathetic of the big three
[2022-12-13 03:15:46] <dragonfriend7738> @lazysamurai Hades got scammed
[2022-12-13 03:15:48] <%Dougdot> adoreNerd
[2022-12-13 03:15:49] <Oni_Hiro> didnt hades save his brothers from their father though?
[2022-12-13 03:15:52] <%CloverTheCherub> Yeah but being god of the underworld means Hades gets the most money
[2022-12-13 03:15:53] <%+Rexinator> drew the short end of the stick...almost literally
[2022-12-13 03:15:57] <%mikasa88> poor hades
[2022-12-13 03:16:00] <%$TheCollectorRaven> Hades got a wife and all the riches of the underworld
[2022-12-13 03:16:01] <LazySamurai> @dragonfriend7738 basically ye
[2022-12-13 03:16:02] <xGilford> Hades is the only slightly nice god :(
[2022-12-13 03:16:03] <%freximuss> in most other mythology theres always a brother geting cucked
[2022-12-13 03:16:06] <%Doppelganger_Xaos> Hades pull the shortest straw, but he does take it with stride
[2022-12-13 03:16:08] <+malthepal4071> We back here
[2022-12-13 03:16:08] <+jhnn01> isn't hades the most worshipped, since minerals come from the earth?
[2022-12-13 03:16:11] <treble0110> but hades can make his own sitcoms without any input from zeus
[2022-12-13 03:16:12] BITS: Old_Wolf_Logan (100)
[2022-12-13 03:16:12] <%Old_Wolf_Logan> Cheer100 but he does have the healthiest marriage of all the Olympian gods.
[2022-12-13 03:16:20] <+commanderpoes> Hades technically was meant to inherit the world, and since everyone dies everyone becomes his subject eventually.
[2022-12-13 03:16:26] <%WolferZerotheDarkOne> talk about a dead business xD myusagEyebrow myusagEyebrow myusagEyebrow
[2022-12-13 03:16:29] <%Zauana> hades is the only one that actaully acts like a husband too
[2022-12-13 03:16:29] <%judgment37> Poseidon underestimates the Power of Pissed Off

[2022-12-13 03:16:34] <%CloverTheCherub> @jhnn01 well nobody usually worshipped Hades cuz the ancient greeks feared death a lot
[2022-12-13 03:16:43] <thetinygraydog> Its funny because mythologically Hades was the nicest of all the olypians

[2022-12-13 03:18:45] <+commanderpoes> The only thing that people think of as negative behavior from Hades is him kidnapping his wife. However, in the original myth Zeus TOLD him to do it and then lied to everyone else about where Persephone was by saying he didn't know where she was. So the blame was put on Zeus for all of that.

[2022-12-13 04:24:30] <$Eshtarr> Hi
[2022-12-13 04:24:34] <%$biggerb0at> this is a long fall
[2022-12-13 04:24:37] <%wowow2264> he at least respects the reason why hephaestus stood against him even if he doesn't regret it.
[2022-12-13 04:24:40] <%Bakstabr> Its the first thing he mentions when he finds the first automaton he thinks Pandora is Calliope for a second
[2022-12-13 04:24:43] <Haepax> He feels no remorse until much later (GoW4 & ragnarok), because at this stage his rage burned away all other feelings unless he was shocked out of it like with athena's sacrifice

[2022-12-13 04:25:12] <MontyMayhemTV> where can you play this game? I loved god of war 2018 and want to play the other games

[2022-12-13 04:25:25] <PurpleGoetia> You can tell he cares to some degree over someone like Posieson’s wife, who is also a means to an end yet all he does is shove on while Pandora, he shows genuine concern

[2022-12-13 05:01:49] <KunumaHasake> There's a comic that explains what he did before the events of the new GoW, also originally there was another idea for the game that had both the Egyptian and Norse gods that fill I the power vacuum and Kratos teams up with two other versions of himself. When they kill of the gods and I mean ALL of the gods Christianity began and the Kratos along with the two versions of himself become the three wise mean...at least that's what I heard

[2022-12-13 05:16:29] <%+Nyte_Reaper> Yeah, dad Kratos is better than revenge Kratos.
[2022-12-13 05:16:29] <%Yoshi6400> Kingdom Hearts lore is a mess.

[2022-12-13 05:17:48] <%Yoshi6400> @thetinygraydog I felt that a bunch of the lore was just a bunch of random reasons to add in more Disney and Square-Enix series and characters to the game.
[2022-12-13 05:17:50] <%Vorpyrean> I love Barry Kramer's good enough summary of KH lore

[2022-12-13 23:59:29] <UnlimitedCharacter> I had an existential crisis about my father dying, on the anniversary week of my mother's death. he's not in any danger of dying currently however he is old and I just can't help but have those intrusive thoughts because of how old he is. in any case, you asked how I was, I'm ok now, just here to chill, don't mean to be a bummer
