[2023-01-05 10:19:23] <+miltoff> no no
[2023-01-05 10:19:31] <+miltoff> these ones are for battle pass
[2023-01-05 10:19:36] <Ezras> after that start saving gold for bundles
[2023-01-05 10:19:45] <%+Benelioto> you want to get to pool 3 quickly, so makes sense
[2023-01-05 10:19:49] <+miltoff> u dont need to have battle pass to fullfill this missions
[2023-01-05 10:20:03] <Ezras> because it's the best purchase over doing mission refreshes
[2023-01-05 10:20:47] <%criticalinfusion> Hell's Kitchen is a place in NY, this is were Daredevil sits

[2023-01-05 10:23:05] <@%zubedoo> its the best thing to spend gold on anyways
[2023-01-05 10:23:05] <arshiatrex> these are separate missions

[2023-01-05 10:25:53] <@%zubedoo> who goes first

[2023-01-05 10:26:16] <thepipersson13> at who's name revealed is based on who is ahead in the game
[2023-01-05 10:26:19] <+miltoff> look now - oppo is first
[2023-01-05 10:26:20] <Zentimuz> Whoever is winning lanes gets priority
[2023-01-05 10:26:22] <@%zubedoo> @Spyro_ZA now its Nick
[2023-01-05 10:26:31] <@%zubedoo> its the person winning and name glowing
[2023-01-05 10:26:32] <@%zubedoo> basically
[2023-01-05 10:26:33] <%+Benelioto> so high level play is often dictated by gaining or surrendering priority
[2023-01-05 10:26:35] <Zentimuz> So for tech cards it’s best to let them win lanes early CoolCat
[2023-01-05 10:26:42] <+miltoff> you play against same guy KEKW

[2023-01-05 11:12:23] <BlackStarLightning> Can also add hulk

[2023-01-05 11:14:03] <%shashank0034> if u play zabu, cut infinaught
[2023-01-05 11:14:05] <dumbobashh> You become reliant to draw zabu can become a mess

[2023-01-05 11:14:24] <coheran> not worth you need better 4's for zabu
[2023-01-05 11:14:27] <hyperion100> isnt zabu only good if you have the good 4s
[2023-01-05 11:14:37] <+xspectrum7> cosmo bad in zabu deck
[2023-01-05 11:14:53] <%shashank0034> zabu is good if u have more 4's

[2023-01-05 11:16:02] <quantoll> You need powerful early drops like lizard or starlord to secure storm lane, had similar deck while i was in pool 2, took me to rank 70 alone
[2023-01-05 11:16:03] <%shashank0034> then play 4 card
[2023-01-05 11:16:10] <%shashank0034> 4 cost Groot @spyro_za
[2023-01-05 11:16:10] <Zentimuz> Bishop instead of Groot because you most likely won’t storm combo @spyro_za

[2023-01-05 11:16:33] <%shashank0034> the 4 cost version of Groot. play that @spyro_za

[2023-01-05 16:31:29] <quantoll> You can also play white queen on Luke bar if your hand is full, then it won't come back in hand @Spyro_ZA

[2023-01-05 16:34:02] <n3nat> Is this game pay to win?
[2023-01-05 16:34:17] <Crayonfart_> there are cards with minus power for example
[2023-01-05 16:34:17] <quantoll> Hover your card around bar KEKW
[2023-01-05 16:34:21] <Rience__> u can put the hood on that location
[2023-01-05 16:35:00] <drowningseason> compared to gwent, for sure, but gwent was absolutely f2p, most cards games aren't that generous
[2023-01-05 16:35:08] VIEWERS: 403
[2023-01-05 16:35:28] <+ShdwRptr> Snap is better than Hearthstone but worse than Gwent and Legends of Runterra for f2p
[2023-01-05 16:35:29] <drowningseason> you can be f2p in this game but probably will get annoyed by the season pass cards
[2023-01-05 16:35:34] <Iwilljoy> later you fond cards with negative power, that can played in bar, also you can move enemy cards there with magnito or aero for example

[2023-01-05 16:36:19] <drowningseason> but also, 10€/month if you're actively playing is not insanely high, it's hard to whale in this game
[2023-01-05 16:36:20] <xsneiper> The bundle prices are crazy
[2023-01-05 16:36:22] <quantoll> @ShdwRptr I don't know about HS, at least there you can craft new cards or cards you want. not in snap
[2023-01-05 16:36:22] <+ShdwRptr> Snap is amazing for the first ~500 levels of playing which is about 2 weeks. After that it's a pretty steep cliff that makes it hard to compete for a couple of months
[2023-01-05 16:37:03] <+nefarian_klubr> if its bad for everyone its good for everyone

[2023-01-05 16:37:19] <+ShdwRptr> @quantoll I agree that you can craft any deck in HS but it takes about 1-2 months to make each deck in that game and within 4 months of Snap you have most of the cards and are in a great place so it's a tradeoff
[2023-01-05 16:37:36] <quantoll> Snap is unique card game where you don't get excited for new cards because there is no way you can get them unless you already have complete pool 3 and donate a lot of $
[2023-01-05 16:37:43] <Iwilljoy> it is not P2W because its pure casino, but it is play to progress, which is annoying. But you can easily be competitive with F2P
[2023-01-05 16:38:00] <Iwilljoy> pay to progress
[2023-01-05 16:38:46] <quantoll> @ShdwRptr But if you want to play something like negative or galactus, you can't do anything about it unless you get lucky

[2023-01-05 16:40:05] <+ShdwRptr> @quantoll True, Pool 5 is terrible and needs to be fixed but I have been playing Snap since October and am at CL2000 with no Pool 5 cards and only a couple Pool 4 and have 3 very competitive decks that can get me to Infinite no problem

[2023-01-05 16:42:25] <+ShdwRptr> Other than Surfer I guess since that's Pool 5 but was in the Season Pass

[2023-01-05 16:43:25] <%+xspectrum7> I guess we could play second white queen to different location @Spyro_ZA
[2023-01-05 16:43:51] <Iwilljoy> MegaMogwai on 3500+ CL had all pool 3 cards, but he cant get pool4 and pool 5 cards, because he recieve only shit in cache for 30+ cache in a row

[2023-01-05 16:44:34] <+ShdwRptr> Pool 5 is a mess and Ben already said they are thinking of ways to address it. 6000 tokens for a card they are going to discount and potentially nerf for no refunds is BS

[2023-01-05 16:45:45] <+nefarian_klubr> can you buy tokens? 💳
[2023-01-05 16:45:47] <xsneiper> You unlock the token shop at 500 collection level
[2023-01-05 16:45:49] <+ShdwRptr> You also then open 100 tokens every 4 collection caches
[2023-01-05 16:45:56] <Iwilljoy> @shdwrptr Yea, but you also must recieve more tokens in the cache, b cause 100 points for 16 levels of CL is a freaking joke
[2023-01-05 16:46:18] <quantoll> Yes
[2023-01-05 16:46:40] <+ShdwRptr> You can only buy tokens through bundles which are uncommon. Only two token bundles have come out so far

[2023-01-05 17:06:29] <+ShdwRptr> Most high Pool 3+ games revolve more around setups where you know your opponent will play Silver Surfer or Leader and have to know whether you can beat it

[2023-01-05 17:18:03] <Jazzarus_> yeah, that happens a lot, that's why you snap before showing your stuff
[2023-01-05 17:18:12] <drowningseason> but otherwise, you don't snap, yeah
[2023-01-05 17:18:18] <+soarta> 2 cubes and playing games out knowing that you're winning > 1 from snapping on turn 6  and forcing retreats
[2023-01-05 17:18:32] <+ShdwRptr> Snapping early is usually best. Snapping on the last turn usually isn't correct unless your opponent has already done it and you're sure you'll win
[2023-01-05 17:18:34] <+fluffyturt1e> you always snap if you have your win con
[2023-01-05 17:18:45] <Jazzarus_> preferably don't snap and take the extra cube
[2023-01-05 17:18:46] <stefsot> you snap as earlier as you can, your snap was a bit late but not that late
[2023-01-05 17:18:58] <+ShdwRptr> Snapping on turn 5 or 6 is usually too late and your opponent will probably leave
[2023-01-05 17:18:59] <drowningseason> it depends on how obvious it is, but 2 cubes still better than 1, that's why early snaps are better
[2023-01-05 17:18:59] <Jazzarus_> unless you actually want to scare them off

[2023-01-05 18:02:41] <%+xspectrum7> Spyro also close to pool 3 right now @TVkun2
[2023-01-05 18:02:55] <drowningseason> could've played dino mid and hulk left so he can't shang chi either to avoid 50/50, but backseating afterwards is easy KEKW

[2023-01-05 18:04:26] <%+TVkun2> @xspectrum7 yes and that is why he might face opponents that got a pool 4-5 card really early in their pool 3 progression. If you face opponents that have pool 3 cards, they can also, in theory, have pool 5 cards.

[2023-01-05 18:49:21] <drowningseason> when the opponent snaps early and you have a shit hand it's good to just retreat, even if it feels like you can draw the right cards

[2023-01-05 19:00:33] <+ShdwRptr> CL 400-1500 is the hardest to play the game. You get a lot of uneven matches
[2023-01-05 19:00:34] <@%+xahverius> it's slow
[2023-01-05 19:00:56] <Crayonfart_> early p3 is rough
[2023-01-05 19:01:02] <@%+xahverius> shwand after 1500 gets easier?
[2023-01-05 19:01:30] <Iwilljoy> Game is simple for first look, but than it becomes very complex. So easy to lose, so hard to win
[2023-01-05 19:01:40] <+ShdwRptr> It gets easier after 1500 because you have at least 2 very good decks so even facing people at CL3000 isn't that bad
[2023-01-05 19:01:47] <Mithfin> The real hard-stop is then you just enter the tier-3 bracket. Basically, you'll have just 1 or 2 shitty tier-3 cards, and will be playing against fully-optimized pro decks.
[2023-01-05 19:01:53] <xaron_in> he will play infinaut mid or left

[2023-01-05 19:02:12] <ligaturemarx> It’s common to play against people with series 3  cards when you’re almost out of series 2.

[2023-01-05 19:03:02] <Mithfin> you will get to tier-3 matchmaking based on your collection level.

[2023-01-05 19:05:57] <ctssPLay> some 6 prov cost cards affect more locations than one
[2023-01-05 19:06:01] <quantoll> @MoonBrick123 But they problem is both he and dino are 5 energy, so you kinda have to play Fury instead of additional dino

[2023-01-05 19:21:02] <ctssPLay> he played 3 4-cost cards in last turn u can expect that when opponent have zabu
[2023-01-05 19:21:03] <insaniity> because of other cards such as mr negative, sera, etc
[2023-01-05 19:21:31] <+ShdwRptr> @insaniity I tried to make it work pretty hard day 1 and it just didn't No DarkHawk, Shuri, or Absorbing Man made my plays pretty underwhelming.
