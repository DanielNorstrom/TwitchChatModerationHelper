[2023-01-09 03:57:28] <FakeWawi> I collected Pokemon cards as a kid, but I never learned how to play
[2023-01-09 03:57:29] <%StellaraCrow> Are the gloves meant to protect the cards or the h*nd-holding people?
[2023-01-09 03:57:30] <%ZillaOmega> DRAPION!
[2023-01-09 03:57:30] <AslanGrants> Yoooo

[2023-01-09 03:57:38] <%$pikawoo27> hi tane
[2023-01-09 03:57:41] <Zandothar> Drapion is good
[2023-01-09 03:57:46] <%$pikawoo27> what we opening today?
[2023-01-09 03:57:52] <%+InsaneProxy666> pokeman cards
[2023-01-09 03:57:52] <%$pikawoo27> OH SHIT I FORGOT
[2023-01-09 03:57:52] <gundam0121> a wild tane sensei has appeared. gundam says hello
[2023-01-09 03:57:54] <$KeiHarutoVT> Tane just a heads up- that's like a $11 Pikachu
[2023-01-09 03:57:57] <%Chimon_VT> it's good against the mew deck ironically
[2023-01-09 03:57:58] <$KeiHarutoVT> Very big win reiyuWow
[2023-01-09 03:58:07] <%$pikawoo27> I need to order the Japanese vstar universe packs
[2023-01-09 03:58:09] <%ZillaOmega> hmmm interesting
[2023-01-09 03:58:19] <AslanGrants> the problem is the set rotation
[2023-01-09 03:58:25] <Zandothar> there are some abilities that prevent damage to your benched pokemon
[2023-01-09 03:58:27] <AslanGrants> they don't hold their value
[2023-01-09 03:58:29] <%ZillaOmega> maybe its to help kids get certain cards for tournaments?
[2023-01-09 03:58:31] <+sorengedeon94> how much does a pack of those cost?
[2023-01-09 03:58:38] <gundam0121> I learned once at a card shop
[2023-01-09 03:58:41] <%$pikawoo27> i NEVER knew how pokem9n card games work
[2023-01-09 03:59:00] <%ZillaOmega> maybe it goes with a card that does something when your cards are attacked
[2023-01-09 03:59:05] <AslanGrants> @sorengedeon94 about $3-5 USD
[2023-01-09 03:59:11] <+sorengedeon94> and the full box?

[2023-01-09 03:59:51] <%$pikawoo27> hi zilla
[2023-01-09 03:59:51] <%+jjhanzely> It says it ALSO does 60damae to one of your Pokemon....in adition to doing huge damage to an opponent. Pretty much a recoil move.
[2023-01-09 03:59:53] <AslanGrants> idr how much pokemon boxes are
[2023-01-09 04:00:00] <%ZillaOmega> Pikachu used protection. It was super effective!

[2023-01-09 04:04:30] <AslanGrants> It's the cost for such a damaging attack
[2023-01-09 04:04:40] <Zandothar> losing 2 energy for 130 damage isnt the worst
[2023-01-09 04:04:48] <luci_ko> wow the boobs

[2023-01-09 04:24:17] <%$cat_lionheart> I think Gen 3 was the best.
[2023-01-09 04:24:22] <%ZillaOmega> @AirRookie hey same here!
[2023-01-09 04:24:23] <+Zenny_Xanadu> yeah it's a radiant Gardevoir
[2023-01-09 04:24:24] <AslanGrants> Diamond/Pearl/Platinum are great games, they're just a bit slow. Plat is just the Emerald of Diamond/Pearl
[2023-01-09 04:24:25] <%+jjhanzely> @AirRookie Mine, too.
[2023-01-09 04:24:32] <AslanGrants> But imo Gen 4 was the best
[2023-01-09 04:24:36] <gundam0121> wumple had to butt in
[2023-01-09 04:24:41] <$yuginami> hi
[2023-01-09 04:24:47] <%$cat_lionheart> Gen 1 was my favorite. But I just like Gen 3.
[2023-01-09 04:24:50] <AslanGrants> Platinum and Heargold/Soulsilver are a fantastic duo
[2023-01-09 04:24:50] <%$satanix64> Johto was best region
[2023-01-09 04:24:51] <+sorengedeon94> Gen 4 was really good, i just hated  the long saving screen
[2023-01-09 04:24:55] <+AirRookie> @jjhanzely nice
[2023-01-09 04:24:56] <+sorengedeon94> my favorite gens are 1-2

I didn't know you needed the power cards to play the move. I just picked a pokemon with a powerful move to kill my opponent instantly.

[2023-01-09 08:03:26] <FakeWawi> I talk to a lot of Canadians for work, and most of them speak and act pretty much the same as Americans, but one time I got one of the stereotypically polite ones with the funny accent who was mad about a thing, and it was honestly pretty intimidating. Like passive aggressively and politely expressing his anger.
