[2022-12-23 10:16:41] <+adoragon> @ffyte I haven’t seen 7 in ages. Did he get his personal life issues  squared away? I know he had some which affected his streams a year or more ago

[2022-12-23 10:17:41] <+adoragon> Thats good. I wish him the best.
[2022-12-23 10:18:09] <+adoragon> He should take a page from my playbook and shave his head with a razor though hahaha >_<

[2022-12-23 10:19:42] <+adoragon> Speaking of FF. Im debating buying reunion. Bought CC years ago when it released but don’t remember much.
[2022-12-23 10:20:51] <%$FFyte> based on the ~2h I've seen it, it seem very faithful to the original
[2022-12-23 10:20:56] VIEWERS: 128
[2022-12-23 10:21:09] <%$FFyte> some tweaking here and there, in addition to the graphical updates
[2022-12-23 10:21:24] <@%+Mike410459> I never played the original CC. But if you liked FF7R, CC:R plays very much like it. I cant compare to the original but its so much fun.
[2022-12-23 10:21:47] <+adoragon> Are there any updates or just graphical/voice?
[2022-12-23 10:22:07] <+adoragon> I was okay with FF7R but didn't love it
[2022-12-23 10:22:26] <+adoragon> Will still get the others but they weren't my cup of tea

[2022-12-23 10:23:12] <+adoragon> Then again, I seriously disliked FFXV and the battle system is fairly similar
[2022-12-23 10:23:39] <%$FFyte> you can run FF7R in a more traditional mode, iirc
[2022-12-23 10:24:13] <+adoragon> The best part of XV is Pitious (spelling?) IMO
[2022-12-23 10:24:33] <+adoragon> I don't remember that but I'll have to Google it

[2022-12-23 10:27:26] <+adoragon> @ffyte exactly. Reminded me of a 3d Lufia
[2022-12-23 10:27:47] <+adoragon> I loved SNES RPGs with puzzles
[2022-12-23 10:28:48] <%$FFyte> as long as it wasn't like do something, figure out what's next and have a battle in-between

[2022-12-23 11:12:01] <+NurseNerdGamer> never could figure out how they defeated that carrier and their friends came out. Were they being held hostage?
[2022-12-23 11:12:25] <%$Glairs> they were piloting it
[2022-12-23 11:12:31] <%+Lixeffect> Werent they hiding in it cause it was explosion proof
[2022-12-23 11:12:40] <%$Glairs> or something like that
[2022-12-23 11:12:41] <%+Lixeffect> To survive a base exploding etc
[2022-12-23 11:13:01] <%$Glairs> yeah, they hopped in before the base exploded

[2022-12-23 11:13:28] <%TidusZecht> based on what you steal from it, it's constructed from Adamant
[2022-12-23 11:13:41] <%TidusZecht> it withstands explosions no problem
[2022-12-23 11:14:07] <+NurseNerdGamer> I suppose but if they were piloting it, why attack Squall? Maybe I think too much. lol

[2022-12-23 11:17:33] <%TidusZecht> trying to find the "UNLOCK THE DAMN DOOR" button
[2022-12-23 11:18:06] <+NurseNerdGamer> @tiduszecht thank you. At least that makes sense.
[2022-12-23 11:18:06] <%$Glairs> given how selphie "hacked" that terminal that wouldnt be a surprise
[2022-12-23 11:18:25] <%TidusZecht> *places hands on keyboard*
[2022-12-23 11:18:33] <%TidusZecht> *raises left hand a bit*
[2022-12-23 11:18:47] <%TidusZecht> *puts left hand down WHILE raising right hand up*

[2022-12-23 21:38:49] <@%BGG02> very unlikely he got many parts to actually do an upgrade. Usually not worth worrying about it
[2022-12-23 21:39:10] <@%BGG02> especially if he he capped his strength with another spell
[2022-12-23 21:39:51] <%+jerrit09> Ah, gotcha gotcha :) I was just curious bout it but yea I he can hit his dmg thresholds without it
[2022-12-23 21:40:01] <%+jerrit09> Thanks!
