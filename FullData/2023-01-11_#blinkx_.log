[2023-01-11 13:27:29] <borayaga> do you have a cheat day on your diet ?
[2023-01-11 13:27:32] <@%foxxie_6t4> straight into the mad topics
[2023-01-11 13:27:34] <Tobin> Even though women start with 1‚Äì2 million eggs, by the time you reach puberty only about 300,000‚Äì400,000 of the eggs you were born with remain. The monthly cycle described above then continues throughout a woman's life until there are no eggs left.
[2023-01-11 13:27:46] <Constermocking> @Tobin Lmao , but still we don't get a fresh egg every day from them , but a rotten every month :LUL JUSTKIDDINGGGG

[2023-01-11 14:05:27] <%cypherender> I think the L word means something different LUL
[2023-01-11 14:05:34] <%Queza2> So they get the cash twice
[2023-01-11 14:05:37] <ReadyPandaOne> No tax on any gambling winnings as far as I know
[2023-01-11 14:05:39] <+ayazaurum> If it‚Äôs your only source of income then it‚Äôs also income taxed as well
[2023-01-11 14:05:46] <%morts730> if you're a professional poker player you pay taxes
[2023-01-11 14:05:49] <ElxMyth> All of that is taxed stateside
[2023-01-11 14:05:52] <+DeeKay7> theres often a distinction between things where some "skill" is involved like professional gambling and pure chance winnings like the lottery
[2023-01-11 14:06:04] <%+moisesbed> But poker is not ‚Äúgambling‚Äù you win a tournament prize
[2023-01-11 14:06:10] <zlatandaboz> literally  money god surrendered

[2023-01-11 14:06:39] <+DeeKay7> can you influence slots with strategy? not really
[2023-01-11 14:06:42] <Tobin> slots are pure chance since you have no influence on it
[2023-01-11 14:06:42] <ElxMyth> Sorry I was talking about in America your winnings are taxed
[2023-01-11 14:06:43] <%morts730> no that's how they launder money

[2023-01-11 14:06:49] <+DeeKay7> but im not a tax lawyer
[2023-01-11 14:06:49] <nuundavid95> Slots are sexy for sure
[2023-01-11 14:06:52] <nuundavid95> yes
[2023-01-11 14:06:57] <ForminaSage72> In the U.S., there's no tax taken out immediately from winnings under like $600, so best bet is to just win lots of $600 prizes rather than say, 6k or something, strictly in terms of taxes

[2023-01-11 14:07:18] <$LincolnLee_tv> You don‚Äôt have to claim it unless it‚Äôs over so much!! You can also deduct your losses in America as well
[2023-01-11 14:07:18] <@%$heavymetalrules> I mean you lose more often than you win
[2023-01-11 14:07:25] <@%$heavymetalrules> so you'd run out of money through slots
[2023-01-11 14:07:25] <ipoopiedmyself> yup it does suck LUL

[2023-01-11 14:07:32] <Norbut_dyas> @Tobin i would say loosly "pure chance" since they calculate there payout to a percentage
[2023-01-11 14:07:42] <ipoopiedmyself> if you go to a casino they keep track there when you cash out
[2023-01-11 14:07:47] <%Queza2> In holland allot of people just wanna be payed in cash for that reason
[2023-01-11 14:07:48] <%morts730> cash economy is big

[2023-01-11 14:29:44] <@%$heavymetalrules> Sucking the wound only serves to increase the risk of infection and can cause further tissue damage. A tourniquet is also dangerous, as it cuts off the blood flow and leaves the venom concentrated in one area of the body. In worst-case scenarios, it could cost someone a limb.
[2023-01-11 14:29:47] <@%$heavymetalrules> well I'll be damned

[2023-01-11 14:34:41] <+DeeKay7> i def produce more ear wax than some of my friends but it also might be due to me wearing headphones basically constantly
[2023-01-11 14:34:45] <%syzurp1> I only splash soap in me ears and rinse them I don‚Äôt clean them with anything else

[2023-01-11 14:35:20] <%$VinzDucci> @AmontilladoWolf same here, babys ear canals face inward, thats why they get ear infections a lot, and as you age, they should face outward so they can drain water... mine are still inward

[2023-01-11 14:54:50] <@%foxxie_6t4> if it is hunting for survival then fine
[2023-01-11 14:54:53] <%bajablastnachofries> what about hunting to cull overpopulation?
[2023-01-11 14:54:58] <%Queza2> In holland we have hunters for deer population control since they don't have natural predators
[2023-01-11 14:55:02] <@%foxxie_6t4> for sport i think they are the worst people

[2023-01-11 14:56:05] <Norbut_dyas> i think its a bit harsh to judge someone for liking the "sport" side of the hunt
