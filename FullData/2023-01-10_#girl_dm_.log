[2023-01-10 19:25:18] <%Alno_> well, he also gives you one that makes him not target you. But by that point he was already shooting you a bunch.
[2023-01-10 19:25:19] <RadtheGas> You can technically bleed Yorm but it takes forever
[2023-01-10 19:25:20] <%+NotExplosions> i believe! good luck!
[2023-01-10 19:25:20] <Miano_SEA> Part of le badger crew~
[2023-01-10 19:25:21] <TheDayFlower> There's a way to fight Yhorm without the storm sword that still does reasonable damage. So if you don't wanna do Onion bro you can still fell the giant batatWiggle

[2023-01-10 19:25:29] <deus__vult_infidel> yhorm can be knocked down and riposted if you smack his hands
[2023-01-10 19:25:29] <SyrobeNA> bleed in this game sucks

[2023-01-10 19:25:40] <HeavenlyFather> Probably.  I dont think Bleed was good in DS3
[2023-01-10 19:25:45] <SlendersWrath> bleed is pretty good actually vs some enemies
[2023-01-10 19:25:45] <%Jerzeem> if it bleeds, we can kill it

[2023-01-10 19:25:51] <JaakunaLan> I don't think the dual daggers do bleed
[2023-01-10 19:25:53] <%$electrode13_5> started elden ring during the christmas season, quickly settled on a dual sword dex build, cant deal with slow weapons
[2023-01-10 19:25:54] <%Bazeio> onigiriHmm only dagers include shieds?
[2023-01-10 19:25:54] <Sir_Khris> so much shenanigans did I miss?
[2023-01-10 19:25:54] <SyrobeNA> no bleed was very good but it was nerfed in DS3

[2023-01-10 19:25:57] <Jason_Walker_DOC> Does dagger only mean no shields or other forms of damage, or does it just mean mostly dagger damage?
[2023-01-10 19:25:59] <jojovijo> good start so far

[2023-01-10 19:26:42] <Kamenknight> Is this going to devolve into you stabbing everyone/everything and saying "Do you bleed?" over and over...?
[2023-01-10 19:26:47] <Kizrune> does the abyss watcher weapon count as a dagger? seeing as the off hand is a dagger
[2023-01-10 19:26:49] <Miano_SEA> It's going to be a long journey...
[2023-01-10 19:26:50] <Littlezilla> Can you still parry with double daggers? I forget

[2023-01-10 20:03:26] <Raptor_Quill> the jump is more about feeling than strategy. It's like the force.
[2023-01-10 20:03:26] <%clockworkcontrivance> go ask the fire keeper if she'll give us a lil boost girldmWah
[2023-01-10 20:03:27] <!SyrobeNA> no the actual way is buying a key that costs 20000
[2023-01-10 20:03:29] <Jason_Walker_DOC> Finally caught a GirlDM Dark Souls stream. She spent two hours trying to fly off a tree onto a nearby rooftop, and then fell asleep on stream. What a great entertainer she is.
[2023-01-10 20:03:29] <jv5_guy> its the cool way
[2023-01-10 20:03:29] <%+Lonewolf1043> Ive only played the first, 3, and Elden ring
[2023-01-10 20:03:29] <%WhyWorry07> ds1 is also really good. 2 is definitely skippable imo though

[2023-01-10 20:03:34] <Sir_Khris> well... technically I played Demon Souls back in the PS3 days
[2023-01-10 20:03:34] <!SyrobeNA> this is the free short cut way
[2023-01-10 20:03:36] <%+NotExplosions> i 100 percent get it. i streamed my ds1 playthrough to my friend and he sorted killed my drive by backseating and telling me ehat to do. sadge
[2023-01-10 20:03:38] <%noctis_3d> that got a lot of height
[2023-01-10 20:03:39] <%Ronithstyle> best dlc of this game would be a tiny plank that would let you just walk up
[2023-01-10 20:03:39] <%$jimbeezi> @SyrobeNA I'll check it out. I hate the four kings in DS1 I've been stuck
[2023-01-10 20:03:45] <+Suezette> yeah this just saves 20k souls
[2023-01-10 20:03:45] <vic_weave> In this economy? It's the only way
[2023-01-10 20:03:47] <%+Melancholy_mage> No simple challenge will be Determination_DM.
[2023-01-10 20:03:50] <+Dragon_Saint> I think it is possible to do the jump at the right, but you kinda have to glitch it
[2023-01-10 20:03:52] <%1tsblt> it is as a speed runner say , a skip girldmNoted

[2023-01-10 20:07:02] <%$jimbeezi> @Bazeio agreed and then I got scolded for gifting the opponent a sub as a joke
[2023-01-10 20:07:05] <saitax_07> its the hardest boss... it just cant be beaten... that roof is a real gamer.
[2023-01-10 20:07:06] <Miano_SEA> Why did I even doubt the vigor pick earlier?

[2023-01-10 20:07:36] <%a_real_bird> Is the real boss the roof or the tree ?
[2023-01-10 20:07:38] <%roshicon> roof = Giga-chad
[2023-01-10 20:07:39] <Darkcasfire> nameless king was when I learnt why everyone says that the camera is our true enemy in this game
[2023-01-10 20:07:39] <!SyrobeNA> everyone take a shot for each jump missed
[2023-01-10 20:07:42] <%+HarleyKiri> Battle Of The Tree (OST) should be this areas music and its just jump landing sounds with the occasional voice line

[2023-01-10 20:08:27] <Miano_SEA> More like natural selection
[2023-01-10 20:08:27] <ManlyAlbatross> My problem with the nameless king is sometimes he's slower for no reason and catches you on rolls because you rolled too early cuz that was what the previous tempo taught you to

[2023-01-10 20:13:53] <Pols_Voice> @SyrobeNA I know it‚Äôs a bit late but I‚Äôm helping with dancer. They did update Bloodborne recently, changed damages and other things. Cannon took a damage nerf I believe is one big one.

[2023-01-10 20:14:10] <!SyrobeNA> like hold it down
[2023-01-10 20:14:10] <@%$zMiyuZ> I feel they just keybind the most random thing for that
[2023-01-10 20:14:11] <+Czarwardy> basically have to be running to jump

[2023-01-10 20:14:22] <rborgars> thats how it works on controller too right?
[2023-01-10 20:14:24] <!SyrobeNA> AHHAA
[2023-01-10 20:14:24] <Duggerjuggernaut> you literally hold for run then quick release and tap for jump

[2023-01-10 20:14:28] <%JeffOverTime> you also have to rub your belly and pat your head while doing this

[2023-01-10 20:14:30] <Ryxhen> Isn‚Äôt that the same as on controller? Hold dodge to sprint and then tap to jump?

[2023-01-10 20:28:16] <%+ieatpupies> @Ronithstyle daggers are a subset of knives usually specifically designed for fighting
[2023-01-10 20:28:17] <Kapuchu1> A Knife is single-edged, a dagger is not
[2023-01-10 20:28:18] <saitax_07> knife is by construction

[2023-01-10 20:28:19] <%Sun_Rendered> all daggers are knives not all knives are daggers i suspect
[2023-01-10 20:28:20] <vic_weave> Generally, dagger is a weapon, knife is a tool
[2023-01-10 20:28:20] <WaffleCairn> I think someone said a knife is single-edged, while a dagger is double-edged.
[2023-01-10 20:28:21] <!SyrobeNA> @whynotjavascript consider the title
[2023-01-10 20:28:26] <Berrsy> Knifes are intended for food preparation. Daggers are intended to kill
[2023-01-10 20:28:31] <%vicrinatana> dagger is for stabbing people knife is for cutting stuff
[2023-01-10 20:28:33] <+kolyarut> @koragor It's a pure "git gud" issue, but I wasn't gud yet
[2023-01-10 20:28:34] <%+klinkers> Daggers are dual bladed and knifes only have one blade
[2023-01-10 20:28:39] <%+NotExplosions> dagger is like a step betwixt knife and short sword.

[2023-01-10 20:29:02] <$UndeadNinja97> @ronithstyle Essentially, a dagger is for stabbing and is a weapon, a knife is primarily for cutting and slicing and while it can be used as a weapon, it isn't normally meant to be one.

[2023-01-10 22:17:22] <+snake_like> elden ring just has so much...jebaiting, delayed attacks, and giga fast moves

[2023-01-10 22:17:25] <selethag> Friede, definitely Friede

[2023-01-10 22:17:41] <%aSpaceLion89> yeah id say elden ring combat is more challenging
[2023-01-10 22:17:43] <%Spacekivvi> I mean I use mimic tear so i can't tell
[2023-01-10 22:17:43] <+Dead_eye_sleeper> Elden ring combat is also more precise
[2023-01-10 22:17:44] <Ta11ow> elden ring was much harder early imo
[2023-01-10 22:17:47] <+brandon0220> I'd say they both are pretty similar

[2023-01-10 22:17:56] <leshaundre> Elden ring is ruthless at the start and at the end zones
[2023-01-10 22:17:57] <+ArtixViper> Freide is only bad if you forget to watch for her footsteps
[2023-01-10 22:17:58] <%aSpaceLion89> you do have more tools in elden ring though
[2023-01-10 22:18:01] <jetstreamlove_R> How goes the dagger run?
[2023-01-10 22:18:03] <%ConnerWithAnE> Midi broke things in me that ain't never healed
[2023-01-10 22:18:05] <!SyrobeNA> elden ring has roll catching
[2023-01-10 22:18:05] <Azure_Canid> Only bosses in Elden Ring that were hard were Malenia and Beast Clergyman.
[2023-01-10 22:18:06] <%Ghostlehate> elden ring was too much open world
[2023-01-10 22:18:07] <!SyrobeNA> ds3 doesnt
[2023-01-10 22:18:11] <$drclaw99> Friede second phase is so hard
[2023-01-10 22:18:12] <%SideShot_NL> Placidusax had cooler moves than Midir
[2023-01-10 22:18:14] <%Bazeio> Touch the darkness mom0kiPray
[2023-01-10 22:18:15] <%Jerzeem> it's harder to jumping heavy attack in ds3
[2023-01-10 22:18:15] <Joeproton> elden ring gives you way more avenues to get stronger and not be roadblocked.
[2023-01-10 22:18:16] <TheLauron> Legit, Margit has more moves than most DS3 bosses
[2023-01-10 22:18:17] <su6human> personally mostly run strength builds so for me Friede is roughest, but ER still seems harder
[2023-01-10 22:18:22] <Valfore90> Can we request the "Block montage" if you after need a few secs?
[2023-01-10 22:18:23] <%$Layzay73> @jetstreamlove_R One stab at a Time forward
[2023-01-10 22:18:25] <%clockworkcontrivance> bosses have huge movesets in ER
[2023-01-10 22:18:25] <%$Reinorvak> Elder Ring felt easier to me, but Axe Gang always goes easy.
[2023-01-10 22:18:26] <%Zemedelphos> Good afternoon, dm_
[2023-01-10 22:18:26] <%Alno_> well, elden ring CAN be made much easier with mimic
[2023-01-10 22:18:28] <saitax_07> have you gotten good?
[2023-01-10 22:18:30] <dm_darius_> Part of it feeling faster is probably cause of the lack of linearity in elden Ring.
[2023-01-10 22:18:31] <JoshuaGir> If anything Frieda is more similar to Lady Maria
[2023-01-10 22:18:33] <!SyrobeNA> elden ring litearlly tries to wait for u to roll before attacking and fakes u out
[2023-01-10 22:18:35] <!SyrobeNA> ds3 just swings
[2023-01-10 22:18:39] <!SyrobeNA> for bosses and enemies

[2023-01-10 22:18:41] <$Dragoon790> Really? I've only tried Elden Ring and I got fed up with banging my head against one brick wall after another. Everyone keeps saying just grind levels to cheese it, but I don't feel like it's worth it.

[2023-01-10 22:21:31] <%SideShot_NL> because the true DS3 experience doesn't need boss rewards, beating the boss is its own reward!

[2023-01-10 22:47:43] <$DecadeTheKarateBugman> Dark Souls seems like the unholy marriage of an Elder Scrolls game with the difficulty spikes of Ghouls n Ghosts and Battletoads combined. But it manages to come out as a pretty solid series.

[2023-01-10 23:24:55] <%+Krahazik> your personality is what made it work, as it does here

[2023-01-10 23:25:10] <MezkaG> @ConnerWithAnE It's why her facial expressions were good. She kept stealing them from others

[2023-01-10 23:25:44] <Ryxhen> Honestly I‚Äôve always been curious if my deaf brother could read the lips of your 3D model
[2023-01-10 23:25:46] <+Mox4> I mean, a great face tracking is a foot in the door that could allow normies that don't follow vtubers to watch you :P
[2023-01-10 23:25:46] <Sir_Khris> I understand.
