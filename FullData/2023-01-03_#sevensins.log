[2023-01-03 09:34:38] <@%BGG02> yeah resets are used sparingly in the Fiesta
[2023-01-03 09:34:40] <%TidusZecht> and sometimes you've pulled through on those types of fights to your surprise lol

[2023-01-03 09:35:54] <@%BGG02> the idea is we're at least trying. But sometimes we get like softlocked in an encounter with the fiesta rules or some other special circumstance.  It's not a hard rule, but it's kind of an honor system
[2023-01-03 09:36:09] VIEWERS: 160
[2023-01-03 09:37:07] <@%BGG02> yeah I brought it up and I spent a good 10 minutes there but managed to get out of combat
[2023-01-03 09:37:14] <@%BGG02> judgement call

[2023-01-03 09:38:15] <@%+Mike410459> Overall its about keeping the integrity of the fiesta in tact while also not getting screwed over.
[2023-01-03 09:39:14] <@%BGG02> last year I had to leave that area while in combat because I couldn't get out of combat. This year I was able to get clear in about 10 minutes.  It happens

[2023-01-03 11:59:57] <%Neobullseye> It's one of the two biggest annoyances I have with the game. The battle system itself is really cool, but the fact you get an instant game over when the game decides to gang up on the party leader is really annoying.

[2023-01-03 12:24:30] <%Neobullseye> One thing I've learned in FF12 is that you actually don't want multiple heal Gambits. What tends to happen is that Character A gets hurt, Character B starts to queue up a heal... then Character A gets hurt some more, and Character B cancels the first heal for a stronger heal, wasting the charge time for the first heal in the process.
[2023-01-03 12:24:31] <%$FFyte> nice

[2023-01-03 14:09:10] <%+spectr0nn> @sterroth whatever number comes after 13, so 15 obviously

[2023-01-03 14:10:36] <$LichXM> atleast ff15 is beatable at any level ingore the taste of dirt in your mouth form eating it its jsut extra flavor form tasing 15s floor
[2023-01-03 14:10:41] <%+spectr0nn> so i finally started replaying FF15 yesterday with the royal edition. lol at all the extra dlc weapons they gift you right from the start of the game like Masamune 'n shit
[2023-01-03 14:11:47] VIEWERS: 514
[2023-01-03 14:12:06] <%+spectr0nn> thank god for the added combat tutorial though. i feel like i already understand the combat of the gme way more than i ever did when i originally played it
[2023-01-03 14:12:16] <%+spectr0nn> also i think they tweaked some of the controls and mechanics?
[2023-01-03 14:12:27] <$LichXM> idk im not fmailiar with base
[2023-01-03 14:12:39] <%+ReimHikari> base was a real mess
[2023-01-03 14:12:46] <%+spectr0nn> yeah it always felt messy
[2023-01-03 14:12:46] <$LichXM> so i know some of the changes as told to me like extra bosses in the run
[2023-01-03 14:12:56] <%+ReimHikari> not explaining anything or what changing stick direction midcombo does
[2023-01-03 14:12:58] <$LichXM> patch 1.0 base is a real mess it got much better
[2023-01-03 14:13:00] <%+spectr0nn> but i now actually understand how linked attacks function for example
[2023-01-03 14:13:20] <$LichXM> id argue even if you dont own royal its a game worth revisitign with all the patch content
[2023-01-03 14:13:32] <+DKROMO> hows the offline ff12 run going?
[2023-01-03 14:13:35] <%+spectr0nn> also the 60 fps is quite a relief

[2023-01-03 14:14:05] <%+spectr0nn> not sure if PS4 Pro hits that, but PS5 does at least
[2023-01-03 14:14:38] <sterroth> It cost me more to buy FFXV than any other game. Not getting a game on Day 1 ever again.
[2023-01-03 14:15:02] <sterroth> I had to pay for all the Royal content separately.
[2023-01-03 14:15:07] <$LichXM> honestly the main selling point of the ps4 pro for me is it had better than the stock gen one ps4 hard drive connection so you could drop an ssd in it
[2023-01-03 14:15:19] <$LichXM> and actulaly see improvement

[2023-01-03 14:22:03] <sterroth> The episodes and stuff. The worst thing is I got it with a DVD that didn't work, but because the only Blu-Ray player I had was my PS4 I couldn't determine it was the disc. Eventually saw the content of the DVD ON NETFLIX. That was £10 down the drain.

[2023-01-03 14:41:11] <Emptyeye> yeah, same @crfed (Though I didn't do all the postgame stuff). I beat it, did a *little* crafting, but had no idea what I was doing throughout any of it. HypeLUL
[2023-01-03 14:41:26] <crfed> There was this one boss that was tough, I forget his name. Def a gate keeper boss
[2023-01-03 14:41:28] <Emptyeye> (The crafting I mean, I got the rest of the game mechanics easily enough)
[2023-01-03 14:41:36] <crfed> Name is at the tip of my tongue

[2023-01-03 14:50:39] <Shihali9> I've underappreciated Barthandelus in the Scheming Olympics. Immortality is an unfair advantage, but didn't he lose to a literal deus ex machina instead of his own arrogance or weakness?

[2023-01-03 14:55:08] <Shihali9> @Neobullseye My theory: FF13's encounter balance is based on later SaGa, and SaGa final dungeons and bosses are...not known for being short and easy.

[2023-01-03 15:57:46] <%Neobullseye> In all honesty? FF13 is probably my least favourite game in the franchise. It's still a great game in its own right, mind you; it just does pretty much all the things I don't like in my JRPGs.
[2023-01-03 15:58:09] <%Neobullseye> I never feel like I'm actually in control. Which is of course the entire point of the plot, I get that, but...
[2023-01-03 15:58:11] <%+Delthanin> Oh, Laura Bailey is Serah.  Didn't realize
[2023-01-03 15:58:17] <+Jencey86> cut scenes are good, there's a lot of them
[2023-01-03 15:58:17] <Duxxors> i love the 13 story so much

[2023-01-03 15:58:28] <%Neobullseye> I just want to do stupid stuff and mess around :P
[2023-01-03 15:58:28] <+Jencey86> the story is great for ff13
[2023-01-03 15:58:30] <%+Gryndell> without sequels, it's a good game
[2023-01-03 15:58:33] VIEWERS: 583
[2023-01-03 15:59:11] <%+Kinitawowi> so what zero punctuation accuses jrpgs of being; a movie where you pause every so often to pick up the remote and fiddle with the controls
[2023-01-03 15:59:17] <%+ReimHikari> ff xiii-2 noel story is good
[2023-01-03 15:59:18] <@%+Mike410459> 13 to be great needed (better, repeatable, and just more) minigames
[2023-01-03 15:59:31] <%+ReimHikari> issue is serah doing things in the middle for me
[2023-01-03 15:59:47] <+Jencey86> My single biggest gripe about FF13 is getting money LUL
[2023-01-03 15:59:48] <+arkyre> did i make it just in time for ff14?
[2023-01-03 15:59:49] <%TidusZecht> so, i got a question: why did CID have to die twice in this game? did he not die enough on FF VI playthroughs? bggHaa
[2023-01-03 15:59:52] <%+Gryndell> change eidolons fights :p
[2023-01-03 16:00:04] <%Lonefellow> We needed more Pulse freedom and a bit more variety in content. That's about it
[2023-01-03 16:00:08] <%Neobullseye> It's just the complete lack of choice through the first half of the game or something that completely turns me off.
[2023-01-03 16:00:22] <+Wolpetinger> it did not exceed our nerds expectations ... but still good =)
[2023-01-03 16:00:34] VIEWERS: 583
[2023-01-03 16:00:42] <%IndecisiveNinja> Too much lore in FF13 was in the friggen log book
[2023-01-03 16:00:46] <%Neobullseye> Again, it makes sense in the plot. It's just the opposite of what I seek in JRPGs xD
[2023-01-03 16:00:48] <Duxxors> gorgeous game
[2023-01-03 16:00:55] <+nemo_76> the linearity is one thing, but having no control of who is in your party and who the leader is kinda chains your hands, like you have no control at all
[2023-01-03 16:01:35] <%Lonefellow> And then they tried again with Luminous before backpedalling somewhat
[2023-01-03 16:02:20] <%Lonefellow> Square seems to be at its best when it's not focusing on engines and instead focusing on making a good game
[2023-01-03 16:02:30] <%Neobullseye> I remember X. I also remember X allowing me to do stupid shit like putting Yuna into Wakka's or Auron's path and bonk Fiends in the face for max damage XD

[2023-01-03 16:02:55] <%+Delthanin> 7 remake is crazy good
[2023-01-03 16:03:08] <crfed> So what’s the best take away from ff 13 story? Real talk
[2023-01-03 16:03:11] <@%+Mike410459> If your party leader dies its game over and is also susceptible to Insta Death attacks is the worst thing about this game.
[2023-01-03 16:03:12] <+nemo_76> @Neobullseye yep, and choosing who you want in battle, assuming you have more than 3
