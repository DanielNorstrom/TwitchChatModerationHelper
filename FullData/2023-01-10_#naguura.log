[2023-01-10 13:32:27] <+mischy_> I was going to say I think sometimes people die with a pot available or something because they didn’t think they were in lethal

[2023-01-10 14:26:36] <%Stricken79> I swear every healer in every key is either an evoker or rdruid, and I don't do high keys. I've had some really good healers that aren't these classes

[2023-01-10 15:13:25] <+steazwonder> @HairClog they just get stale tho if its the same 8 dungeons for 2 years
[2023-01-10 15:13:38] <Yuno___Gasai> @mothypants 2-3 of them ye, was just for mages trinket, but still dmg profile is weird if you compare it to 20's only damage that i feel like has that much random group damage is the early part of nokhud

[2023-01-10 16:19:08] <Analfabestia> moonkin is in the same state as before, but maybe with the new rework to the talent tree will do great
[2023-01-10 16:19:10] <kroxywuff> yeah, you jump while moving as it blows up, never take a ground dot tick
[2023-01-10 16:19:24] <+shoxxntv> so we can just remove starfire from our bar right ?

[2023-01-10 16:28:46] <Honeybear> its like wrathion raid boss from bfa
[2023-01-10 16:28:55] <Honeybear> gotta move as little as possible
[2023-01-10 16:29:04] <shedixe> when u have stacks check
[2023-01-10 16:29:08] <shedixe> the orbs will run at u
[2023-01-10 16:29:55] <shedixe> if u have 10 orbs run at u

[2023-01-10 16:33:00] <HairClog> Thats smart of them
[2023-01-10 16:33:34] <shedixe> so if u have 10 stacks then run at u

[2023-01-10 17:39:26] <+AloftPanda> 411 M+ Tier chest today.... 55 runs of HoV for mote and no mote....
[2023-01-10 17:39:31] <elegoras> hello from Czech Republic
[2023-01-10 17:39:39] <+Mishkka> yea dude, and i have my vault complete full, all raids and all dungeons complete, just bad rng i guess
[2023-01-10 17:39:56] <+Mishkka> i just wish the catalyst was out already
[2023-01-10 17:40:10] <%+Hyppotilus> 0 set pieces ftw
[2023-01-10 17:40:15] <lvl_up_together> that chest is for sure vault :) it says mythic on it and has upgrades

[2023-01-10 17:40:49] <@%Kuroz> VIBE
[2023-01-10 17:40:53] <%Sebleh> IMO they should double the weekly valor cap increase with the catalyst release and remove it a month later.
[2023-01-10 17:41:01] <%Sebleh> @warryvibe VIBE laters!
[2023-01-10 17:41:01] <joksi91> Hey what party frame you use?

[2023-01-10 17:41:25] <+buzzaa> Ok , thx
[2023-01-10 17:41:32] <+buzzaa> :)
[2023-01-10 17:41:45] <%Sebleh> Remove the cap a month later*
[2023-01-10 17:42:14] <%Sebleh> Because clearly the catalyst is the point where blizz is like “okay catch up now” but they probably still don’t want people to just free farm loot just yet.
[2023-01-10 17:42:36] VIEWERS: 2 314
[2023-01-10 17:42:42] <%Sebleh> So IMO 6 weeks after raid we get catalyst and bigger valor cap increases and 10 weeks we get valor cap removed.
[2023-01-10 17:42:45] <%+sim967> What I’m wondering is if the catalyst will be unavailable for the first few weeks of each season?
[2023-01-10 17:42:57] <+Danielnworb> What's the highest key you've completed?

[2023-01-10 17:44:09] <brotdassbernd> i like nokhud, a lot of big packs for big dps xD
[2023-01-10 17:44:09] <LukasasPlays> this and Temple of the Jade Serpent
[2023-01-10 17:44:21] <MemoAcebo> do tanks sim gear?
[2023-01-10 17:44:22] <%Sebleh> The first part of CoS is naguuraMonkaS but the rest is pretty cool.
[2023-01-10 17:44:25] <meatbun> temple is mega aids as healer
[2023-01-10 17:44:26] <Reloe> where does court rank on your "worst trees" tierlist?
[2023-01-10 17:44:28] <+jackderbaer1337> i can understand the valor cap for world first situation, but after it, no  onde needs it in my opinion
[2023-01-10 17:44:33] <palvaro123> hey naagura evoker dps or druid balance?
[2023-01-10 17:44:37] VIEWERS: 2 359
[2023-01-10 17:44:46] <%+bigtilter> @MemoAcebo yes but its not as accurate as dps sims
[2023-01-10 17:44:49] <%+LtJenkins> @MemoAcebo absoutely. Tanks are just dps that don't die.
[2023-01-10 17:44:50] <+AloftPanda> I've run HoV 55 times now :D  .....
[2023-01-10 17:44:50] <Zelaise> not sure why they don't just remove the boat from the key peepoGiggles
[2023-01-10 17:45:36] <@%itsClubby> They hurt monkaW
[2023-01-10 17:45:58] <%jacksplatt> its seems like you are always doing CoS
[2023-01-10 17:46:07] <Uzzex> try playing melee in CoS. its a bloody nightmare :P
[2023-01-10 17:46:15] <Reloe> @Zelaise yea they should just remove boat and reduce timer by 1minute
[2023-01-10 17:46:40] VIEWERS: 2 359
[2023-01-10 17:46:48] <Zelaise> @Reloe exactly ahahah
[2023-01-10 17:46:48] <Zelaise> just tedious and annoying
[2023-01-10 17:46:58] <+cptnfat> everytime i am starting her stream she´s in COS :D
[2023-01-10 17:47:14] <Reloe> esp with how many ways to skip the boat ride in the past I'm surprised they haven't just done that PepeLaugh
[2023-01-10 17:47:37] <%+sim967> It’s all true, but still it’s the second easiest dungeon to time
[2023-01-10 17:47:44] <+MeshyMan> Jesus what is that warrior damage
