[2023-01-07 11:19:35] <coolfurry1876> Sleep is a period of rest that alternates with wakefulness. You have internal body clocks that control when you are awake and when your body is ready for sleep. These clocks have cycles of approximately 24 hours. The clocks are regulated by multiple factors, including light, darkness, and sleep schedules.

[2023-01-07 14:37:30] <%Skaydger> vrc was such a wild experience for me when it came to nausea. first time using the headset I lasted like 15 minutes. 2nd time for like 30 minutes. 3rd time was going great, hit 3 hours and then with no warning my body rejected existence and I had to lie motionless face down on the floor for a solid 40 minutes. Then I have been fine ever since (even in fast moving worlds with cars and stuff)
