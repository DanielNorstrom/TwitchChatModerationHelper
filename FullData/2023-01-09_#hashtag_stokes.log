[2023-01-09 11:18:13] <%aidan_acluvsufan_fan> when didy was playing, he kept triggering his RF/RCM to run in a straight line then doing a lobbed pass/through ball and the defenders didnt react at all he kept scoring it

[2023-01-09 11:19:08] <%ADelaney1991> if history has anything to go by you know EA ain't doing shit haha
[2023-01-09 11:19:08] <%+gugashero> R9 was moving fraudulently for everyone yesterday
[2023-01-09 11:19:14] <%st_dani1712> from what I saw you relied too much on cr7 and he needs to go as you sometimes rushed crosses for him .. I think mbappe would fit you so much better
[2023-01-09 11:19:14] <%aidan_acluvsufan_fan> thoughts on payet being the chubbiest most useless lump of fat on the game?
[2023-01-09 11:19:16] <eddarrd> should i start mid puskas or adama, other attackers are mahrez, jair and mbappe
[2023-01-09 11:19:21] <%+LionXCR> Varane over Van Dik?
[2023-01-09 11:19:21] <MattyyCakes> is it best to have balanced on the forwards or get in behind for 4321
[2023-01-09 11:19:23] <!%Daanfc> Bro even fut champs and div rivals is just 24/7 4321
[2023-01-09 11:19:26] <%followthesponge> can you show the tactics again bro
[2023-01-09 11:19:26] <russellwijayaa> Whats the 4321 custom tactics
[2023-01-09 11:19:28] <+migeftw> 4231 is good defensively but for me is so slow in attacking, i find it really hard in elite to attack with 1 striker
[2023-01-09 11:19:30] <xylexxy> use ethans tactics for 4321
[2023-01-09 11:19:30] <callemane> what have you boght ?
[2023-01-09 11:19:32] <maz162> best formation to see out a game?

[2023-01-09 11:19:40] <%sonyman123> Ethan will spend the money on clubbing and hookers ;)
[2023-01-09 11:19:40] <daWorldPeace> don't like Mbappe?

[2023-01-09 12:45:16] <+andreass95> Pogba the worst united signing of all time no?
[2023-01-09 12:45:18] <%+palachu_04> since going to United Pogba has spent more time injured than playing
[2023-01-09 12:45:18] <%+topshelfmari0> It was a really weird marriage with pp
[2023-01-09 12:45:19] <maz162> pogba with casemiro would be unstoppable

[2023-01-09 12:46:00] <%+Footimaster> Yeah Pogba left his blood sweat and tears on the pitch every Utd game
[2023-01-09 12:46:17] <eastcowescrews93> Pogba and caserimo would be absolutely disgusting

[2023-01-09 13:09:20] <ayzouu_by> @russellwijayaa rb ronaldo is very good for me
[2023-01-09 13:09:21] <zII_Punisher_IIz> Having R9 etc is a big upgrade to running round with a neymar or something

[2023-01-09 13:09:34] <%+jammymctavish> i added jairzinho and capita this weekend and got 17-3 for the first time - just made that extra little difference

[2023-01-09 13:09:53] <zII_Punisher_IIz> jairzinho is the most annoying card this year

[2023-01-09 13:10:13] <ayzouu_by> @russellwijayaa highly recommend getting him :)
[2023-01-09 13:10:15] <+GuiltyArcher> getting mbappe was the biggest game changer for my team, jair and vvd is probably next

[2023-01-09 14:26:31] <+Cocoman_Fact> 4321 is good because you don't have to manually trigger runs most of the time.
[2023-01-09 14:26:32] <LyricalGhost> ethan has that through ball vs set defenses tho. no one else doing it

[2023-01-09 14:28:58] <+aymuni> You can make it defend as a 442

[2023-01-09 14:29:57] <sixpenny_keep256> Your going to GA some formations

[2023-01-09 14:30:29] <+aymuni> Baby Henry LF or Di Maria?
[2023-01-09 14:30:34] <+giantosti10> As an italian, i‚Äôm deeply offended. As a fifa player, i agree
[2023-01-09 14:30:35] <+punyay> who's 4321 tatics are you trailing?
[2023-01-09 14:30:37] <+BroomeyJC> Issue is would people just use narrow and 352?
[2023-01-09 14:30:37] <drizzy10> once you get use to it, other formations feel very limited
[2023-01-09 14:30:37] <LyricalGhost> I mean if they ban 4321 everyone will use the tuga formation. 3421. same patterns
[2023-01-09 14:30:40] <+Leonboro> But then everyone will just use 41212 narrow or 4312 for same effect no?
[2023-01-09 14:30:41] <%+Harwoodinho> Havent used 4321 since the Ibarbo Doumbia Gervinho days tbh
[2023-01-09 14:30:42] <%+migeftw> i dont think ea can actually do anything about the formation whatsoever

[2023-01-09 14:47:46] <+saurabh_17> what makes 4321 the best formation?
[2023-01-09 14:47:49] <McSauce1> Im gonna stay 442 every year now
[2023-01-09 14:47:49] <+anonymoyz> yo stokes best chem for saint?
[2023-01-09 14:47:55] <SUMZUH> 4222 the best for me
[2023-01-09 14:48:06] <+little_jimmy07> Does anyone use the basic 442?
[2023-01-09 14:48:09] <k0iramies> Is that really the case? one formation is so much better than others?
[2023-01-09 14:48:15] <%+Skovzy> yeah thats mad
[2023-01-09 14:48:34] <McSauce1> Anders playstyle isnt perfect for those shitty swiss servers tho

[2023-01-09 14:49:25] <+little_jimmy07> game gets stale when everyone uses the same thing and you play the same thing
[2023-01-09 14:49:26] <algobyte> its like saying the backpass rule in football wasn't a problem because all teams could do it

[2023-01-09 14:49:38] <Thunder_pug> it leaves no room for the tactical game either
[2023-01-09 14:49:39] <McSauce1> Formations shouldnt be broken, everyone should  be equal

[2023-01-09 14:49:46] <+saurabh_17> 4321 is super enjoyable tho
[2023-01-09 14:49:46] <Rutskaa> sorry
[2023-01-09 14:49:46] <+aymuni> I thought 4231 would be the formation this year
[2023-01-09 14:49:48] <%DNNYKLLY> @ichelinski no
[2023-01-09 14:49:49] <mullianho> i will not speak then

[2023-01-09 14:50:06] <bluehorse99> at least 4321 is a fun formation
[2023-01-09 14:50:10] <Premtitty> you prefer prime r9 or WC r9?
[2023-01-09 14:50:13] <%+Footimaster> It says it all if the highest placed players were running common formation
[2023-01-09 14:50:13] <ichelinski> @DNNYKLLY dont u find yourself open when oppoent counter attack
[2023-01-09 14:50:17] <DM_XI> @harwoodinho much easier to play against 352 this year, just hit the wings early
[2023-01-09 14:50:19] <niktraj17> Nkunku potg worth it at striker ?

[2023-01-09 14:51:08] <%papa_pronezz> @hashtag_stokes I have fodder for half the SBC, should I do Zidane or wait for another good SBC?
[2023-01-09 14:51:11] <%+Harwoodinho> @DM_XI Oh yeah its definitely not as good this year, but I've just upped the depth a lot and look at it as a 325 more tbh, try outscore people

[2023-01-09 14:52:24] <%DNNYKLLY> @ichelinski I have IF Tomori and Maldini CB‚Äôs and Baby Vieira CDM so those three contain most counters.
[2023-01-09 14:52:28] <%moonedog97> Can't you do a Gentlemen agreement for fifa pro's like they do with cod pro's
[2023-01-09 14:52:29] <trundle93> Mid zidane good and sbc worth completing
[2023-01-09 14:52:33] <%+TylerJord> think of it like this, imagine been forced to use a certain formation or you lose. not healthy for esports
[2023-01-09 14:52:33] <+DAREEN> Feels like 90% of playerbase use 4321

[2023-01-09 14:53:04] <bluehorse99> free kick getting a patch too?
[2023-01-09 14:53:08] <%jordan_g1888> Header knock ons are the worst, no idea why they aren‚Äôt manual

[2023-01-09 14:53:27] <+Cocoman_Fact> With short corners they need to fix how the player who comes short drifts into the attacking position in space to receive the pass.
[2023-01-09 14:53:34] <ShyShyBoi_> Thoughts on trent
[2023-01-09 14:53:41] <%cj_nsza> they have to fix corners so many free goals yesterday
[2023-01-09 14:53:45] <Premtitty> you prefer prime r9 or WC r9?
[2023-01-09 14:53:49] <savvom> Fuck ea
[2023-01-09 14:53:57] <+marnzzz> @niktraj17 if you watch football, the rw or rm marks the fullback in most times, that doesnt happen on fifa
[2023-01-09 14:54:09] <+uniquezuk> i dont play LoL but people i know do and im sure they say that the pro scene ban / patch broken champions / mechanics when stupidly op so ea have no excuses for slacking and should be doing the same if they want to go esport ready right.

[2023-01-09 14:54:28] <%+Harwoodinho> @jawaadslays Depends how confident you are defensively mate, you get punished big time, but you'll definitely get chances if you use your wings and spread opponents teams out, its a nice option to switch to mid game i'd say more than anything
[2023-01-09 14:54:30] <kcrazy767> who do u prefer stokes di maria or the new mahrez
