[2022-12-31 06:37:03] <%+murixbob> you can get one of those faucet filters that should be able to remove the chlorine though

[2022-12-31 06:37:52] <%+Zithras2> Some places the tap water just tastes bad though
[2022-12-31 06:38:06] <+hamaal1> A reverse osmosis system would
[2022-12-31 06:38:07] <%+murixbob> @Zithras2 that mostly has to do with mineral content
[2022-12-31 06:38:07] <%zebrin_star> activated charcol filters do not remove chlorine.
[2022-12-31 06:38:12] <$Anaxeala> It should. I had an aunt who wouldn't drink tap water unless it was like at her place with a filter on the tap
[2022-12-31 06:38:18] <williamneilssen> yeah, my city's tap water is booboo

[2022-12-31 06:42:28] <!%TropicalFreeze21> i agree migraines are the most pain ive been in
[2022-12-31 06:42:31] <$Anaxeala> low tech solution to chlorine is to let it evaporate (it'll evaporate from the water in fridge as long as it's in an open container.)

[2022-12-31 08:31:00] <%DragonfaceX> @KiwiTasticStreamer Fun fact; Did you they named it Feraligatr instead of Feraligator because engine restrictions wouldn't let them have the extra character so they removed the O?
[2022-12-31 08:31:04] <%Ezzlin> All hail present launcher!
[2022-12-31 08:31:05] <%+hamaal1> That thing is seriously OP

[2022-12-31 10:13:54] <%Ezzlin> I don't why more mice don't have at least like 4 buttons
[2022-12-31 10:14:00] <%Ezzlin> On the side
[2022-12-31 10:14:10] <@%TidusZecht> i recently bought that one
[2022-12-31 10:14:10] <Seraf04> the Naga Pro is almost the same (while wireless), but the 6 button is 2 rows instead of a circle... the 6 button one is the best for just general use too
[2022-12-31 10:14:16] <%WitnessProtection_> buying them up before they go out of stock.
[2022-12-31 10:14:17] <@%TheInfamousBug> I used the first gen version of that a long time ago when I played WoW.
[2022-12-31 10:14:45] <@%KiseSwiftmist> I used to use the Hex, but I didn't like the software. So I ended up using the Rog Spatha X which has similar side buttons, but not in a circle
[2022-12-31 10:14:49] <@%TidusZecht> i needed another one with all 12 buttons lol
[2022-12-31 10:14:55] <Seraf04> 12 is too many, 2 is too few
[2022-12-31 10:15:00] <%ZenithMedium> I have an old 3-button mouse, I don't think it's even USB, probably PS/2
[2022-12-31 10:15:26] <@%TheInfamousBug> 12 is not enough when you play a raid healer in WoW and trying to also multitask raid leading at the same time with callouts sakuLUL
[2022-12-31 10:15:28] <%Ezzlin> I had a 6 button the side mouse which was nice, but it started dropping inputs so I had to replace it
