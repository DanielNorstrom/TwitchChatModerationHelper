[2022-12-07 17:32:33] <%MORFIXX> Just seen a vib on youtube with a FP race, looked kinda wicked
[2022-12-07 17:33:45] <BenHodgson17> It would probably get very annoying after a while
[2022-12-07 17:33:46] <%MORFIXX> Would make cop chases harder, and easier for people to get away
[2022-12-07 17:33:48] <SneakyTeddy> its wicked cause its new but not in a long term

[2022-12-07 17:54:38] <%+Atom8tik> @Atom8tik Would also recommend 'eslint-config-prettier', which will make them work together. Else it might be a hassle with the conflicts.
