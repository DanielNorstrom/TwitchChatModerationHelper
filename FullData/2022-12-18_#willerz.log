[2022-12-18 23:31:53] <%thelastleroy> Killcam would help a lot with that problem, but would also take away from the tarkov experience I think
[2022-12-18 23:31:54] <%+Ganked_Gamer> I had a bad habit of calling sus for the first couple hundred hours, because the random "how the FUCK did I did" moments were spread out enough to make it feel that way

[2022-12-18 23:33:49] <+Twis26> feel like its impossible to call cheats unless they r flying around or shoot u in the head 20 times with a gun and ammo that would be impossible to do so
[2022-12-18 23:33:52] <%exexXD> But not because of revealing cheaters or anything

[2022-12-18 23:35:05] <%exexXD> SilentService12 Yeah, but more or less it can effect just your attitude or better your mindest. I played alot of CS or Pubg and so on....and the only thing killcam is really good for, getting to know your mistakes better
