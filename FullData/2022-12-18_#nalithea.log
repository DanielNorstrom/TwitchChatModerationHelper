[2022-12-18 00:02:21] <+BetrayedFoxy> @Nalithea you should put a specs panel in your about.
[2022-12-18 00:03:11] <%+pyromana192> one more panel would be fine
[2022-12-18 00:03:29] <%+pyromana192> you did a lot liar

[2022-12-18 00:03:50] <WatermelonVT> gg!!!
[2022-12-18 00:03:51] <+BetrayedFoxy> Not everyone is going to read the panels. There are some people who never even look at people's about. Panels are there for those who want to see them so adding another panel isn't going to hurt.
