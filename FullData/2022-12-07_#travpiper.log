[2022-12-07 17:40:12] <%krplop> I personally prefer compound bows, but recurves are really nice

[2022-12-07 17:40:39] <%NemisizZ> compund is the one that you barely have to pull in
[2022-12-07 17:40:42] <%SalaciousSpoont> compound requires less strength to keep pulled
[2022-12-07 17:40:46] <%1blueplague> compound bows output more energy and speed
[2022-12-07 17:40:50] <%xChevinxForever> Damn those mini cheeseburgers were good
[2022-12-07 17:40:53] <%+markus_6969> I used to train with a compound bow. Its a great upper body workout
[2022-12-07 17:40:55] <%+DIRTBOMB13> I was looking at them. They have a set for like 100$ I might get
[2022-12-07 17:41:00] <%+itsxbuzzkill> im using my HD 280s again
[2022-12-07 17:41:01] <%xChevinxForever> but I'm still hungry lol
[2022-12-07 17:41:23] <Lacks_Pants> recurve is awesome for bow fishing, killed so many carp with a shitty bow when I was a kid
[2022-12-07 17:41:31] <%krplop> compound bows are easier to pull with more powerful output
[2022-12-07 17:41:35] <%ShadowFox1803> @travpiper if your getting into bows please get a forearm guard
[2022-12-07 17:41:36] <+rhetts14> @xChevinxForever Should've had normal size cheeseburgers
