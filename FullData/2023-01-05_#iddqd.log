[2023-01-05 08:48:32] <strife_ow1> they should do the banning thing like in League or Dota, just vote to ban 1 character each role

[2023-01-05 08:49:56] <%+elcocal> @iddqd you know, I have 1400 hours on the game, i placed tank and dps silver for the first time on over watch 2‚Ä¶ obviously I got diamond as tank in 2 weeks or so and as dps I‚Äôm shredding at low ranks‚Ä¶ so yeah I find the game way better then the end of over watch 1 but the matchmacking system is trash in my opinion:/
[2023-01-05 08:49:56] <zeddidit> @iddqd  in league u have  bans and all it dpoes at high elo is people target ban one trick heroes and then these guys are just not performing and either havre to get carried or they feed
[2023-01-05 08:49:57] <r1ptidestv> in diamond no one pockets sojourn

[2023-01-05 08:50:45] <stickmanstock> push would be banned on everyones game
[2023-01-05 08:50:45] <KreyGasmed> push is the best mode though

[2023-01-05 08:51:18] <+y04rm0m> I haven't enjoy a single push map...
[2023-01-05 08:51:22] <%Spitfire2k6> Hero pool isn't deep enough for a b/p system imo
[2023-01-05 08:51:25] <%gsh14> i mean the current map pool is pretty limited rn if we had the full pull i feel like then it would be weird if we didnt have it
[2023-01-05 08:51:26] <%pheasant_sc2> i'm suprised blizzard doesn't copy their own good ideas sometimes

[2023-01-05 08:51:45] <@%daisy82078> If we can get a better mix of maps, would be good as well. Playing the same map 4-6 times in a few hours of play sucks.

[2023-01-05 09:00:21] <iKeepTV> well twitch has build a monopoly, of course they get greedy....
[2023-01-05 09:00:22] <+eFShaD> if u already had that 70 / 30 split u could keep that no? they just removed that for new "partners" who would have gotten into that split bracket, no?
[2023-01-05 09:00:23] <DragonfaceX> There's a dude I watch that has 18k subs, that's 90k a month, and Twitch gets half of that.
[2023-01-05 09:00:40] <%best_cica> hi thx for the sub <3
[2023-01-05 09:00:43] <%GreenJL> @eFShaD they capped it to a certain amount per month
[2023-01-05 09:00:45] <%w3_rd> whats the topic?
[2023-01-05 09:00:46] <%Clapts> Still making 100% more money you would be making without the job
[2023-01-05 09:00:52] <DragonfaceX> @DragonfaceX There's 0% chance it costs them $9.5k to host 1 dude per month.

[2023-01-05 09:01:29] <+eFShaD> was a pretty "high" cap tho no? first 100k in that split
[2023-01-05 09:01:42] <dorev_> My man is just clicking
[2023-01-05 09:01:42] <bigbotCas> @DragonfaceX it's more the fact that the majority of people who stream make them absolutely no money, think about all the 5 view andies out there

[2023-01-05 10:30:44] <Aiki_Taka> I think he could also benefit from trying to mix things up more, he kept dieing from the ashe the same way because he did the same thing which made him predictable

[2023-01-05 12:18:09] <+isojeh> I remember them saying every role would have players in the same skill rating etc 2 diamond dpses on my team would mean 2 diamond dpses on their team. This is still not in effect any ideas when ?

[2023-01-05 12:55:51] <%2kl2live2hot2die> my view as well, not just in this game, but in general, as a support, you shoot a tank 10 times in a row and NOTHING happens. Whereas a dps and a healer will get killed in 3 shots.

[2023-01-05 12:57:56] <%Goryllo> @taargetfight you stress your shots more when you're on widow because she is the actual sniper and you're just too stressed about landing a one shot?
[2023-01-05 12:58:18] <+bluberryninja> @iddqd what if they have a flanker like genji or Winton and they focus you high ground? What goes through your mind when a stronger opponent challenges high ground king?

[2023-01-05 13:35:46] <%alenaistyping> yes quite common
[2023-01-05 13:35:47] <%+Tsaku007> sometimes
[2023-01-05 13:35:47] <taargetfight> yes with mercy
[2023-01-05 13:35:48] <dorev_> Depends
[2023-01-05 13:35:48] <dylannifermeloni> sometimes but mostly ashe recently in diamond

[2023-01-05 13:35:51] <ezmoneyok> yes
[2023-01-05 13:35:54] <%+sliime69420> its such a broken pick
[2023-01-05 13:35:55] <KiiXuOG> No one targets them in low ELO
[2023-01-05 13:35:55] <+Adjilino> Yes, and no ones can kill :V
[2023-01-05 13:35:57] <%+Jupiter_Witch> I see Sojourn a lot more
[2023-01-05 13:36:00] <%T3rminatria> almost every game last weekend I had a pharmacy in the enemy
[2023-01-05 13:36:00] <+isojeh> Nah pharah distribution among all ranks is pretty similar imo
[2023-01-05 13:36:00] <MellowzTV> @iddqd its also region, EU is very pharah heavy
[2023-01-05 13:36:00] <maandelbrot> gold and i hardly see her
[2023-01-05 13:36:04] <%+ellier18x> my boyfriend hates it when I play Moria I'm getting the hang of playing her but I can't position properly
[2023-01-05 13:36:07] <GetawayStar> I hate playing with and against pharahs LUL
[2023-01-05 13:36:10] <Infinity22> i just pick it when they have no air control like reaper/junk
[2023-01-05 13:36:11] <sithism> there is a lot of pharmercy
[2023-01-05 13:36:20] <%+sliime69420> im so good w pharah but i just feelk guilty
[2023-01-05 13:36:20] <%+Tsaku007> pharah mercy is annoying in my support rank because people avoid looking up
[2023-01-05 13:36:22] <%strichz> Gale plays ashe
[2023-01-05 13:36:22] <%alenaistyping> I see more ashe and more widow in my rank every day
[2023-01-05 13:36:25] <KaylonGrace> Pocket Pharah is common in bronze/silver and usually the movement is bad but people don't know how to punish it
[2023-01-05 13:36:26] <Brutal2Easy> Pharmercy is pretty broken at lower ranks
[2023-01-05 13:36:30] <%Spitfire2k6> Who's replay is this?
[2023-01-05 13:36:33] <%Bezemgast> I think pharah is the only hero in the game that makes your opponents instantly switch to counter her, people hate playing against her
[2023-01-05 13:36:39] <%+sliime69420> soj, moira, soldier ju8ghhhh\
[2023-01-05 13:36:42] <%+Jupiter_Witch> I see Pharmercy for like early pressure, then they change

[2023-01-05 14:28:35] <@%^Fossabot> Vod review submissions are on hold for now, we have so many that we want to try to get through during the educational series. We will open it back up if we need more vods. Exception: if you need to provide a re-review vod per the request of IDDQD from a vod review. Please contact a mod.
