[2023-01-06 10:37:22] <sheck5588> do you think orisa need nerf ?
[2023-01-06 10:37:22] <hoohula> revert game to orisa release from ow1 and call it a day

[2023-01-06 10:38:59] <gzone_ow> problem solved
[2023-01-06 10:39:18] <hoohula> bliz has been botchin the game for years
[2023-01-06 10:39:33] <talon824> Brig buffs always scare me coz we ALL KNOW by now she is 1 meta shift away from running the game. Moira is gonna take giga buffs or a rework to make her meta in top tiers for anything other than survivability, but lower rank players don‚Äôt want a STRONGER Moira‚Ä¶

[2023-01-06 10:42:24] <talon824> They have to look at you without a barrier
[2023-01-06 10:43:01] <platypus17> Blizzard is just bullying players by not fixing Hanzos dumb bow animation, and the Zen orb bug where outlines are constantly blue on enemies. Straight up disadvantageous. How can these things be ignored so much. Fix that pls before you BUFF MOIRA.

[2023-01-06 10:44:31] <talon824> @wepth Coz she never gets played in top tiers
[2023-01-06 10:44:31] <gzone_ow> kirko doesn't cleasne herself anymore when she tps
[2023-01-06 10:44:56] <+sortabulletproof> As a newer player one of the only reasons im still playing is because im 2 games off a rank up
[2023-01-06 10:44:56] <talon824> I miss when they included all the changes in the patch notes
[2023-01-06 10:44:58] <%TheFitnessGamer> yeah.. those JQ buffs.. they're something arent they?
[2023-01-06 10:45:02] <hoohula> what is he up to now?

[2023-01-06 10:50:21] <talon824> @zelnyte_ Yes, her bleeds don‚Äôt get cancelled if someone dies, carnage can be used more often, and her bleed for landing knife is better, for some less damage on landing it
[2023-01-06 10:50:53] <AWildMat> So your solution is to nerf all tanks? How?
[2023-01-06 10:50:53] <zelnyte_> oh that's nice, I actually really enjoy playing junkerqueen
[2023-01-06 10:51:06] <scally0x> hard to please everyone

[2023-01-06 12:06:54] <UrineAssassin> The shots learn perfectly in the middle of the head yea
[2023-01-06 12:06:58] <M0rg3nT> mozey288 anti cheat will never be good enough unless its like valorant
[2023-01-06 12:07:04] <cloutpatrol7> cheat or no cheat its just widow doesnt belong in this game
[2023-01-06 12:07:06] <M0rg3nT> even then valorant still has cheaters sometimes
[2023-01-06 12:07:19] <ppOverheater> blizz has no anti cheat and a million dollar company doesnt care it seems like
[2023-01-06 12:07:19] <+matureadult_69420> lol that wall there on the tracer

[2023-01-06 12:07:44] <+NapZi_> @M0rg3nT Valorant anti cheat only works because of valorants slower pace though
[2023-01-06 12:07:45] <+iSeraphh> His positioning seems abysmal
[2023-01-06 12:07:46] <+CaTaLyST_24> @cloutpatrol7 she does belong in this game. It's an fps game and snipers are part of every fps game.

[2023-01-06 13:33:11] <mozey288> @oprahsclam you can research arm and wrist aim. Low sens is why many people have giant mousepads so they cant move their whole arm
[2023-01-06 13:33:13] <nudelockerroomguy> haha, it's not possible to detect all cheats, once you get to masters and GM cheating is rampant, anyone who says different naive
[2023-01-06 13:33:15] <PhysicalMagic> @nudelockerroomguy nah he has strange aim corrections all the time, and sudden mouse movement changes

[2023-01-06 14:20:46] <Magic_Gopher> overwatch is dead by daylight now. Tanks are the killers
[2023-01-06 14:20:48] <HazyForMe> I think we need 2 tanks. Thoughts?
[2023-01-06 14:20:49] <loojey> How would they even balance it
[2023-01-06 14:20:49] <ckinfiler> Overwatch has been ready for esport since release :)

[2023-01-06 14:21:18] <%Ëå∂Â§™ (solinthia)> tanks are strong because theres only 1 role of then unlicke heals and dps idk how you would balance that
[2023-01-06 14:21:19] <+chodegod69> maybe its a kink

[2023-01-06 14:21:51] <wowwwooww> it's flexibility that allows for extra days off
[2023-01-06 14:22:00] <ckinfiler> My favorite caracter is the reaper guy
[2023-01-06 14:22:07] <%wruvv> if most comp players dont care abt OWL, what demographic are they even appealing to?
[2023-01-06 14:22:11] <+chodegod69> id rather work 6 8 hours personally
[2023-01-06 14:22:11] <wowwwooww> just like in everything there is give and take but making 4 day work weeks illegal in UK is objectively soft

[2023-01-06 16:40:07] <+lstratz> It's not that it shouldn't be better. It's that blizzard has taken the route of making the game casual

[2023-01-06 16:41:10] <hunter7668r> so proper balance changes hurt the casual audience?
