[2022-12-16 21:11:10] <+KillinInstinct> @Sunshinewalker the rich person carries the real risk if his investment gets trashed and he loses that
[2022-12-16 21:11:25] <%fridayfunfunfun> outplayed moira so hard
[2022-12-16 21:11:32] <+KillinInstinct> that kill was personal
[2022-12-16 21:11:37] <%Sunshinewalker> rich people carrying risk is a good joke
[2022-12-16 21:12:02] <%Sunshinewalker> the people carrying risk are the workers at the bottom of the system
[2022-12-16 21:12:28] <+KillinInstinct> @Sunshinewalker imagine a factory. Someone has to pay for all the employees, the machines, the resources. While nowadays a machine does almost all of the work, the people are still present.

[2022-12-16 21:21:15] <Bamboo808> you could rent it to movie creators or commercials
[2022-12-16 21:21:16] <8unnn> most times monthly rent its like upward of 100k a month
[2022-12-16 21:21:42] <%Sunshinewalker> rent it for one stream Kappa
[2022-12-16 21:22:03] <+KillinInstinct> I think they wouldn't want to risk destruction of property or bad usage of the house by people who just rent it
[2022-12-16 21:22:12] <+zerkuei> Material wise prob like half a mil
