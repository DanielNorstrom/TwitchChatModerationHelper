[2023-01-10 19:21:01] <@bearnugget> i remember that one warrior deck where if you play the mirror you could get to the turn limit :)
[2023-01-10 19:21:02] <+Karatedom> fatigue decks were kinda based
[2023-01-10 19:21:04] <%solazahs> @FenoHS I keep facing warriors and blood dks in dumpster legend and getting fkd, they remove everything i play
[2023-01-10 19:21:09] <DaggettTheAngryBeaver> you mean attrition decks...
[2023-01-10 19:21:18] <%Giggle_hs> thats my favorite kind of win condition tbh

[2023-01-10 19:28:17] <zakitten> the proof is the number of classic players

[2023-01-10 19:29:16] <DaggettTheAngryBeaver> yes, power creep is normal and needed, but every few years it needs a RESET.... so for the next rotation i would hope they severely nerf all 2022 sets, so the first set in 2023 can have a lower power level

[2023-01-10 19:32:09] <Keldyra> its true, more playable decks, but I would hate it. I dont like HS games that go on for 10min or longer
[2023-01-10 19:32:11] <%Grudge902> some people want every game to go to fatigue, 30+min grindfests

[2023-01-10 19:32:15] <babyyshaark_> renathal was more playable decks but also every deck was playing the same cards like school teacher denathrius brann and stuff so
[2023-01-10 19:32:25] <@L0RINDA> @Grudge902 ladder system isnt really built for that on a regular basis
