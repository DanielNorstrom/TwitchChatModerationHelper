[2022-12-08 16:46:29] <$Zonra> some of my favorite characters iv had where scheming mass murderers. Once had an african king that had killing people with scemes as his solution to everything, also his hobby when nothing much to do. had like 100+ secret kills when he passed at 80 years old. Sadistic is fun for stress relief. pkroseManic
