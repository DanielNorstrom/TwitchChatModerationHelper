[2023-01-02 09:34:49] <@%^Nightbot> To promote a healthy community and chat environment for both other viewers and myself as a streamer, I have several words that are blocked from chat (rip, oof, reset, and a few others), and also prefer that you don't use F when I die or fail something in a run as I could not filter the single letter. If you try to send a message with one of these words, you will get an error message. I also purge pepe and pepe-related emotes. I hope you understand, and thank you for watching!

[2023-01-02 09:40:30] <%rixkey> yeah honestly having to be this reliant on blaze kick probably would have killed you at some point, if it wasn't sunflora
[2023-01-02 09:40:30] <Tauqmuk> 10% chance to miss and hasn't missed again yet =/

[2023-01-02 10:07:38] <%ChocolateDave> Very important. Mitochondria is a great class. Powerhouse of the cell and also is 12 characters which is why it is a trainer class

[2023-01-02 10:09:36] <ChrisLink> but also your spdef was badge boosted, idk if you accounted for that

[2023-01-02 10:50:00] <$UTDZac> red icon is fine, but first drag the file to your main tracker folder

[2023-01-02 12:48:26] <lucky__starfish> infinite pp with berries would be very op
[2023-01-02 12:48:35] <%+Gameaholic2D> Even if it wasn't farmable infinitely, there would've been a reliable source of berries
[2023-01-02 12:48:38] <nuhji> Lum berries would suck though, cause they only yield 1 unless you actually keep track of them
[2023-01-02 12:48:46] <%PyroJakk> that'd be a lot of extra item rolls I guess
[2023-01-02 12:48:53] <%2pert> You could make kaizo-lite rules for yourself and harvest them
[2023-01-02 12:48:57] <%AwakenSmok3> Imagine if the items from the berry trees were also randomized

[2023-01-02 13:41:27] <%+CourageousAxolotl> @jayemecee I believe the vast majority of the time they are the same as their earlier evolutions. Although i think there are weird cases where there's a difference
[2023-01-02 13:41:40] <%ocran_> Just as it was foretold
[2023-01-02 13:41:42] <jayemecee> oh so even though its impossible to have a blastoise b4 36, on the game database, he has "learnable" moves. am i getting it straight?

[2023-01-02 14:39:35] <%sin_pyro> I think my most unfortunate loss was due to my Milotic's low speed. Right before Gio in Hideout, a Dustox used Perish Song. I could have just beat it out if the last mon wasn't a Feraligatr which I had no coverage for.
