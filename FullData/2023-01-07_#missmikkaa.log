[2023-01-07 16:47:19] <@%Radolov> @MissMikkaa if you turn off ray tracing, turn off DX11
[2023-01-07 16:47:20] <%deymoro> In steam settings u can actually make it so you can see fps of the game
[2023-01-07 16:47:21] <Billbob> no

[2023-01-07 16:47:26] <+Duraikan__> you could just switch dlss to performance
[2023-01-07 16:47:27] <luxusAI> yeah with a 4090 :D

[2023-01-07 16:47:30] <@%Radolov> @MissMikkaa I meant turn on DX11
[2023-01-07 16:47:30] <@%Yruhatin> ray tracing might be viable for 4090
[2023-01-07 16:47:32] <Extectic> If you have a 4090, it's sorta viable

[2023-01-07 16:49:42] <@%K3nzz0> Still dropping
[2023-01-07 16:49:42] <Extectic> Raytracing loks great and dramatic but... there's such a thing as too much realism
[2023-01-07 16:49:42] <@%xblom> hahahhahaha
[2023-01-07 16:49:42] <Iukyn> this looks GREAT

[2023-01-07 16:49:50] <%batsybats117> less than 60 fps for sure for us

[2023-01-07 16:49:51] <@%xblom> hatin is low fps
[2023-01-07 16:49:52] <+Duraikan__> nah this is perfect
[2023-01-07 16:49:52] <@%Radolov> @Yruhatin It's relatively fine, but I would suggest DX11

[2023-01-07 16:49:58] <%fire_bird613> @super_cool94 its actually siri i think
[2023-01-07 16:49:59] <sans342165> The update isn't optimised
[2023-01-07 16:50:01] <Capsa84> I think, after switch to RT, You have to restart game

[2023-01-07 16:50:08] <jokuTM> RT Ultra really only runs on 4080 and 4090
[2023-01-07 16:50:09] <Sith_Lord_JarJar_Binks> Game devs love RT but no one can use it lmao

[2023-01-07 16:50:13] <Billbob> @Radolov is there any difference to play on DX11 vs 12? Just raytracying right?
[2023-01-07 16:50:13] <%deymoro> RayTracing is shit pushed by NVidia that does nothing epheyMad

[2023-01-07 16:50:24] <Irohsw> Update is great on PS5,  but PC with Raytracing is fucked up lol
[2023-01-07 16:50:24] <%Thydus_76> this is why we play Elden Ring mikkaaMmh it works
[2023-01-07 16:50:27] <korbin_dallas_> what you do in your own time is your own business LUL
[2023-01-07 16:50:29] <@%Radolov> @Billbob Just the RT yeah, also the CPU performance is better in DX11
[2023-01-07 16:50:30] <%brianthebroken85> I find it funny that you can earn far more money selling weapons than killing monsters...I'm more arms dealer than Witcher. :)
[2023-01-07 16:50:33] <Extectic> When DLC drops for me... I usually have to replay the game, because I've forgotten everything HypeLUL
[2023-01-07 16:50:34] <%jerzh93> My RTX 3060 can keep the FPS at minimum 60 at 1080p without ray tracing
[2023-01-07 16:50:35] <star_swarm> 3080 - try without DLSS + Ray Tracing, should be OK (do not know if you play 4k)
[2023-01-07 16:50:35] <Storyteller_max> i hope she goes fetch better witcher armors
[2023-01-07 16:50:37] <%schattenvektor> its clearly lagging
[2023-01-07 16:50:43] <Thedudec> My suggestion: - Everything on Ultra except RT (off) - DLSS - Quality - Disable Nvidia Hairworks - Fullscreen mode - Restart the game
[2023-01-07 16:50:44] <meaper77> 3 saddles - one for yen , triss and geralt

[2023-01-07 16:50:59] <%deymoro> It's classic CDPR guys, we just need to wait like half a year until they fix it

[2023-01-07 17:06:27] <%deymoro> CDPR games never had great combat sadly
[2023-01-07 17:06:32] <+Augusto1600> just my opinion but god of war combat is better than elden ring combat
[2023-01-07 17:06:32] <chunleyy> the combat is meh, but the storytelling is great
[2023-01-07 17:06:32] <the__tay> it's somewhere between Skyrim bad and Elden Ring good lol
[2023-01-07 17:06:34] <%cropperTV> nooooooooooo
[2023-01-07 17:06:34] <Irohsw> did the same played it after elden ring, its fell more old for combat but still good when you get use to it again
[2023-01-07 17:06:34] <dazai_kenny> TURN QUICK CASTS ON MIKKAA

[2023-01-07 17:06:54] <%+hoopy24> @missmikkaa turn on quick casts. it's so much nicer

[2023-01-07 17:07:29] <andthekey> you can go back to the old camera angle from the settings, that camera is much better for combat

[2023-01-07 18:10:18] <doeddy> You should watch the movie Sucker Punch... lobotomy plays a big role in this.
[2023-01-07 18:10:18] <+yaxutiwa1> Technically the game started it?

[2023-01-07 21:25:00] <@%Radolov> The water reflections are broken I've heard
[2023-01-07 21:25:00] <%parotaur> graphics > fps
[2023-01-07 21:25:02] <witherscarf> game's real heavy, you need DLSS 3 to have a consistent 60fps, so not possible with RTX 3000 series
[2023-01-07 21:25:04] <%batsybats117> they gave reflections for the sake of it
[2023-01-07 21:25:05] <@%Radolov> For rivers
[2023-01-07 21:25:07] <%$Timgoespew> well amost
[2023-01-07 21:25:10] <blackavocad0> and raytracing is really not worth it
[2023-01-07 21:25:10] <%GrimGarcia> an infinity pool lol
[2023-01-07 21:25:12] <chef_vii> that view was awe inspiring in game

[2023-01-07 21:25:15] <%parotaur> it's glitched it look like
[2023-01-07 21:25:22] <Micah89> but that reflection would happen if the water was still

[2023-01-07 21:25:52] <@%xblom> wise eyes lol
[2023-01-07 21:25:54] <@%Yruhatin> yeah, it's better for sure
[2023-01-07 21:25:54] <stianz0> 55 fps now
[2023-01-07 21:25:55] <%Michelanio> first time Mikkaa have called Hatin Wise
[2023-01-07 21:25:59] <+Cal_Twitches_Too> ambient occlusion is the soft shadow between two close objects
[2023-01-07 21:26:02] <@%Yruhatin> @Michelanio I will remember this day
[2023-01-07 21:26:02] <%+Daemon138> human eye sees 30-60 fps anyway, so its not like 90 fps is going to look so much different to 60
[2023-01-07 21:26:05] <WeeMah> Looks around 45-55 fps
[2023-01-07 21:26:07] <%$Timgoespew> Ambient Occlusion would mean more shadows cast by objects that normally wouldn't for a more realistic scene. Also softer shadows
[2023-01-07 21:26:08] <%meinMestar> ambient occlusion is like those little object shadows, probably very taxing
[2023-01-07 21:26:08] <%MikeRNight> I don't know what half that stuff means. Ambient Occlusion, wtf
[2023-01-07 21:26:09] <Masterbahner> hello
[2023-01-07 21:26:12] <ThatBexar> yeah, I¬¥d say about 60
[2023-01-07 21:26:13] <Masterbahner> this looks Great
[2023-01-07 21:26:13] <@%Radolov> It's not 60 but acceptable
[2023-01-07 21:26:15] <%Michelanio> @Yruhatin you better have clipped it

[2023-01-07 21:26:42] <%$Timgoespew> Really the main thing you absolutely want is RTX reflections, anything else is just icing if you have the GPU horsepower
[2023-01-07 21:26:44] <%The_Gimp_nVidia> @MissMikkaa you can via NVIDIA GeForce Experience setting show FPS in game
[2023-01-07 21:26:46] <Jutigrillaa> monkaHmm

[2023-01-07 21:31:59] <@%Yruhatin> steam can overlay fps
[2023-01-07 21:31:59] <maiisiie> theres a setting in steam
[2023-01-07 21:32:00] <%batsybats117> if its on steam there is a setting in steam to enable fps

[2023-01-07 21:32:01] <maiisiie> for fps
[2023-01-07 21:32:02] <Corv7nus> it's aight
[2023-01-07 21:32:03] <+BrunoOfMars> light looks better shining through trees
[2023-01-07 21:32:03] <kpd99x> no difference

[2023-01-07 21:32:11] <chef_vii> focus on the 2nd tree to the left with settings on
[2023-01-07 21:32:11] <%GrimGarcia> geforce exp app can show fps
[2023-01-07 21:32:12] <%parotaur> it's more realistic almost

[2023-01-07 21:32:19] <WeeMah> It does, folliage has more depth. But you won't notice while playing
[2023-01-07 21:32:19] <%meinMestar> yeah indoors is where it's at, outdoors is mostly reflections
[2023-01-07 21:32:19] <witherscarf> ctrl+shift+tab for fps iirc
[2023-01-07 21:32:22] <%deymoro> Do you need magnifying glass to see difference? KEKW
[2023-01-07 21:32:23] <%+round_top> tousaint just oversaturated
[2023-01-07 21:32:24] <stianz0> you got 2560, id turn off antialiasing tbh, it should be sharp
[2023-01-07 21:32:26] <+conf585> One of the crazy things about ray tracing are the perfect shadows
[2023-01-07 21:32:29] <blackavocad0> 40 fps ish
[2023-01-07 21:32:31] <@%xblom> @Yruhatin yea i have it turned on by default

[2023-01-07 21:32:52] <%keosak> Ray tracing makes a big difference in shadows and reflections. But honestly, unless you studied computer graphics and if you are used to how games look, you probably won't even notice the difference.
[2023-01-07 21:32:52] <%+kixn_n> no
[2023-01-07 21:32:53] <%meinMestar> that does look good

[2023-01-07 21:39:44] <stianz0> try turn down antialiasing and check if you eyes can tell the difference. If the textures are good it should just look as good with it off.
