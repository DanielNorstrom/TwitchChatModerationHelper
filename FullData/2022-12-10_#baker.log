[2022-12-10 20:23:56] <+TheJuan> problem is he has 0 leapstones
[2022-12-10 20:23:58] <%DAbz786> Omgg, is this that Baker guy everyones talking about ;o catRose meow
[2022-12-10 20:24:09] <+TheJuan> and leapstones if i have to buy are E X P E N S I V E
[2022-12-10 20:24:17] <%+TrickmasteH> Juan that is rough
[2022-12-10 20:24:17] <%+TrickmasteH> Did you buy from Frog vendor?
[2022-12-10 20:24:26] <%+TrickmasteH> Since the value of leaps are high right now.
[2022-12-10 20:24:34] <+TheJuan> no i didnt

[2022-12-10 20:24:53] <%+TrickmasteH> If you want to hone on him, maybe buy out frog vendor
[2022-12-10 20:24:59] <%+TrickmasteH> before u resort to getting leaps off AH
[2022-12-10 20:25:55] <+TheJuan> but those 2 hons can cost me a lot even with vendor and i just dont wanna spend gold :( im on globin mode
[2022-12-10 20:26:11] <%+TrickmasteH> Lol Juan
[2022-12-10 20:26:25] <+TheJuan> coz i also want to save so i can switch my striker to DB
[2022-12-10 20:26:30] <%+TrickmasteH> Its hard to say, what roster you have & what your ambitions are. If you want to make gold, thats 1 extra gold earner :)
[2022-12-10 20:26:40] <timsnart> catRave
[2022-12-10 20:26:48] <%+TrickmasteH> But overall, holding him back 2 taps that could be new materials & gold on week 1...
[2022-12-10 20:26:49] VIEWERS: 568
[2022-12-10 20:26:53] <%+TrickmasteH> I wouldn't advise that :)
[2022-12-10 20:26:56] <%DAbz786> Can someone mail me 20k gold so I can get 1490 so I can do raids with Mr.Bakey <3

[2022-12-10 20:27:41] <%DAbz786> You could have got the stagger, why didnt u use igniter
[2022-12-10 20:27:42] <@%^Streamlabs> because it's the best.

[2022-12-10 20:28:32] <%+TrickmasteH> @TheJuan how much gold you have?
[2022-12-10 20:28:33] <%DAbz786> u would have got it, I always get my stagger done that way and then awakening if I have it up

[2022-12-10 20:29:44] <%+TrickmasteH> so you've loaded them with shards / silver already?
[2022-12-10 20:30:07] <+TheJuan> im checking

[2022-12-10 20:37:07] <%+TrickmasteH> I mean Juan its hard to say honestly, but since hes apart of your 6 gold earning roster, I would make the investment. However I would be concerned now since you waited so late to make the decision with the cost of leaps rising.
[2022-12-10 20:37:14] <%+TrickmasteH> I don't want to tell you to blow your gold, to hit 1490...
[2022-12-10 20:37:19] <%+TrickmasteH> but I do think its of value.

[2022-12-10 23:34:50] <%SyzzAMV> that's barely a bus KEKL
[2022-12-10 23:35:02] <%+DennySommer> in kr only 1 bus you just do with op dps and skip all mechs
[2022-12-10 23:35:07] <%polig> i bet there is setups and ppl who can

[2022-12-10 23:36:12] <%SyzzAMV> I know why people do it but bussing is pretty cringe DIESOFCRINGE
[2022-12-10 23:36:12] <@%^Streamlabs> because it's the best.
[2022-12-10 23:36:14] <%+DennySommer> some buying even multiple clown at onece

[2022-12-10 23:37:16] <%polig> 5k for waiting for a dude and than doing a slower clown, count me out :D
[2022-12-10 23:37:19] <Travistheman425> the video is mainly for new ppl but interesting he bring up bussing and created your own learning party
[2022-12-10 23:37:24] <%hoodidupeh> i said yes in dc
[2022-12-10 23:37:26] <%hoodidupeh> KEKW
[2022-12-10 23:37:37] <%+DennySommer> so every week some people paying 3 or more clown at once
[2022-12-10 23:37:57] VIEWERS: 601
[2022-12-10 23:38:05] <%+DennySommer> but you need burst class to skip marios
[2022-12-10 23:38:15] <%+DennySommer> and no innana thats for pussas
[2022-12-10 23:39:02] <%+DennySommer> m1 cant beskipped
[2022-12-10 23:39:15] <%+DennySommer> you can solo stagger as a pala or destro gl
[2022-12-10 23:39:18] <Boffer123> In KR they started doing 1 man clown bus recently. Busser does all the dps, 3 bus riders do marios and maze and such. It requires people can do mechs though.
[2022-12-10 23:39:21] <%polig> i think perfect setup, juiced mains, good players can 3 map x90 to 0
[2022-12-10 23:39:32] <%polig> 3man*
[2022-12-10 23:39:37] <%honor7m7m0> ATK did a vid about it  is full afk with 3 ppl like 1600+ skiping maze and m3 m4
[2022-12-10 23:39:37] <Boffer123> and the bus riders equip HA-3.
