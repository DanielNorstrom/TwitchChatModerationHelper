[2022-12-29 12:02:41] <+Luckyn1604> yea I picked the spec one too, but maybe expose might help if party lack of crit synergie

[2022-12-29 12:21:42] <+Luckyn1604> the content we're missing take a lot of time, like brel normal gear is like ~3month for most, because they can't consider everyone doing 6 gates from 1st week. Then hard brel will be the same (maybe faster because less progression cause we know patterns). Or they'll increase rewards

[2022-12-29 14:22:43] <goodykerby> @ryan___c based on damage tests i personally did, sb damage is higher. or i might be doing smtg wrong
[2022-12-29 14:23:08] <ryan___c> i believe sb u need to get the last hit in consistently in a raid
[2022-12-29 14:23:43] <ryan___c> cb is a holding skill as well, which can be a filler

[2022-12-29 14:26:39] <ryan___c> u dont take super armor for CB
[2022-12-29 14:26:51] <ryan___c> only energy blast and energy release
[2022-12-29 14:27:20] <+LukiinhasY> @toobruh  you always have to think about the number of times you use a skill in a rotation and its damage consistency, to be able to say that it is strong
[2022-12-29 14:27:44] <ryan___c> force orb u need to be in melee range, to get all 3 orbs to hit and it has insance cooldown

[2022-12-29 19:38:37] <SalemVendetta> @AntipainK you need the crit to make KBW viable

[2022-12-29 19:40:45] <Junichi8369> you should be at like 60%
[2022-12-29 19:40:49] <Junichi8369> at least
[2022-12-29 19:41:02] <@%+Shikiro> for summoners you NEED hallucination for the crit to achieve KBW
[2022-12-29 19:41:21] VIEWERS: 1 334
[2022-12-29 19:41:21] <SalemVendetta> or go salvation/charm and have 1000 from accs, shurdi + adrenaline
[2022-12-29 19:41:22] <%+diiarmuid> @Junichi8369 with hallucination ( swift/spec neck), adrenaline + class engraving you get past 60%
[2022-12-29 19:41:40] <Junichi8369> so 11 from shuri, 15 from adren and what like 20 hallucination
[2022-12-29 19:41:54] <SKKAJU> What class are you playing?
[2022-12-29 19:41:59] <Junichi8369> wait does commune give crit?

[2022-12-29 19:42:12] <@%+Shikiro> communication goes swift crit
[2022-12-29 19:42:14] <SalemVendetta> you go swift crit neck on hallu
[2022-12-29 19:42:17] <SalemVendetta> no spec

[2022-12-29 19:42:31] <SalemVendetta> yeah...

[2022-12-29 19:42:54] <@%+Shikiro> yes
[2022-12-29 19:42:58] <Junichi8369> with those all added up its like 45%
[2022-12-29 19:43:07] <SalemVendetta> + the crit from your accs

[2022-12-29 19:43:39] <Junichi8369> so you have to have party synergy
[2022-12-29 19:43:42] <Junichi8369> ?

[2022-12-29 19:43:51] <SalemVendetta> no, but it's appreciated
[2022-12-29 19:44:00] <SalemVendetta> you can build like that if you have a static, but it's kinda monkaW
[2022-12-29 19:44:05] <@%+Shikiro> 500 crit (+17), Adren 3 (+15), Shurdi +11, Hallucination +20
[2022-12-29 19:44:05] <Grekob> I'm not even taking into consideration lvl 5 shurdi tripod for crit
[2022-12-29 19:44:07] <Junichi8369> ah ok. i need to look more into it.

[2022-12-29 19:44:22] <@%+Shikiro> 17+15+11+20 = 63
[2022-12-29 19:44:25] <Grekob> You can get even more crit with card set
[2022-12-29 19:44:28] <%+diiarmuid> @Junichi8369 nope 11 (shrudi) + 15 (adrenaline) + 20 (hallu) + 17 (crit neck) = 63%

[2022-12-29 21:24:11] <+TroyThe2nd> There's a certain level of gatekeeping that's actually fine - expecting people to have a real build is fine, because there's no other real way to enforce a bare minimum of player understanding if the game isn't going to do it for you - I'm personally not getting gatekept from too much stuff that I really wanna do in the game, I'm just worried that new players are getting smoked out of the game by denies from wild expectations
[2022-12-29 21:24:12] <%wolder1305> Im hyped to play my first valtan after 2 weeks atkRave
[2022-12-29 21:24:14] <+TroyThe2nd> can post roster if you want
[2022-12-29 21:24:17] <okNate> @Excoupe7 i've been playing this whole time and i wont attempt to do clown on an alt unless its 5x3.  I feel like i'm deadweight trolling if i'm only 4x3 tryna do clown

[2022-12-29 21:25:23] <okNate> @TroyThe2nd it is, but why would i expect a random group of ppl with 5x3 to lower the bar just so i can get a group?
