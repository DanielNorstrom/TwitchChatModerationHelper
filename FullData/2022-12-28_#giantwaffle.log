[2022-12-28 19:48:26] <SolariusUOX> Question. I just started the pack and I am wondering something about the ore scanner.  Is the number next to the ore (Iron ore -- 124) the density, or y level?  Does this just tell you it is in the chunk but you still have to find it?  Thanks.  Sorry for long question

[2022-12-28 20:42:24] <kane1941> Is there an ME Fluid chest?
[2022-12-28 20:42:25] <+rofl1436> Turnpoint no, its filling up the fluid drives rn
[2022-12-28 20:42:25] <TxMaverick88> @nesse007 basically, if the system is seeing it, it should be in that tank
[2022-12-28 20:42:30] <coolcake2> if you put more in to the tank, does the number increase in the storage system?
[2022-12-28 20:42:33] <magnus_tottrup> is the export hole on the back of the tank? maby wrench it to an other side
[2022-12-28 20:42:33] <pi70n> search with T if already is stored somewhere
[2022-12-28 20:42:34] <Vickens> high prio - insert there first and output from there last
[2022-12-28 20:42:37] <MidwayAtom> Does it work with another liquid? Then you can cross that the machine or not.
[2022-12-28 20:42:39] <3mmpc> dont you need to configure GT machines to allow input from the back with a screwdriver? or is that different in nomifactory
[2022-12-28 20:42:42] <%+TPells67> Is it storing in the old storage sytem
[2022-12-28 20:42:42] <+IlsaGold> memorycard needed for the bus?
[2022-12-28 20:42:46] <+sorefingers> just leave it and let pati solve it😂
[2022-12-28 20:42:47] <%Turnpoint> did pati maybe up the prio on the drives
[2022-12-28 20:42:54] <papatex15> FIFO
[2022-12-28 20:43:02] <AlfredTheSalmon> you can try passing your fluid drives trough an ME IO Port
[2022-12-28 20:43:06] <+rofl1436> Turnpoint no we just checked its -1 for the drives

[2022-12-28 20:53:54] <+Sentinel1_9> you can use the nichrome coils @Giantwaffle
[2022-12-28 20:53:59] <Tyvern> These homie's taking full advantage of the no-channel feature of this pack^^ Insane amounts of crating terminals everywhere
[2022-12-28 20:54:18] <+HiRez45> @TelRehiad @babyaddalyn i have heard about both of these maybe i gotta give them a try. Ive been playing the 1.12.2 pack and tekkit 2 through the technic launcher
[2022-12-28 20:54:27] <Niceyyy> is it faster than obsidian furnace
[2022-12-28 20:54:28] <jayrickson87> the better coil make the multi smelter go faster
[2022-12-28 20:54:31] <lukasalbert> input output stuffs ?

[2022-12-28 20:55:46] <%TelRehiad> @HiRez45 another option is looking at Sevtech Ages. it restricts what things you can even make based on "ages" which reduces the cognitive load required.
[2022-12-28 20:55:58] <+Sentinel1_9> if you put it down here you should put it in its own room so you can put the HV ebfs in
[2022-12-28 20:55:58] <%00Seren> you have a glass system already
[2022-12-28 20:56:03] <%Dagmoo> waffle could mute that sound but he doesnt just to keep us awake too :)

[2022-12-28 21:46:33] <%+SirNickGaming> Maybe have a manifold that inputs into the furnace
[2022-12-28 21:46:37] <+rofl1436> add a second lvl emitter?

[2022-12-28 21:47:03] <%babyaddalyn> add a buffer chest, with inputs as level emitter
[2022-12-28 21:47:05] <SeaOfMadness_> EnderIO has ORgate cards
[2022-12-28 21:47:06] <%+SirNickGaming> Just move it back a bit. You can have a bunch of interfaces and emitters that put into the furnace
[2022-12-28 21:47:15] <%thecodealive_original> OR gate = point 2 level emitters at conduit
[2022-12-28 21:47:25] <gtluszcz> just pyt separate machine, its simpler and more expandable
[2022-12-28 21:47:34] <1killersquirrel> Why do you need an OR gate? You already filter for the inputs

[2022-12-28 21:51:08] <%+SirNickGaming> Make sure you limit the input to the chest otherwise it will fill with a single request
[2022-12-28 21:51:12] <+Sentinel1_9> @Giantwaffle what i was saying is you have to filter the output from the me system in the conduits so it doesnt dump all the items its set to put into the smelter for the others if one item isnt met

[2022-12-28 21:51:23] <IveBeenWandering> why not from top down to ender chest for more output

[2022-12-28 21:51:27] <+mdsooter> could compress more by putting the chest in a corner instead of conduit right?

[2022-12-28 21:53:37] <InternetPlumber> the real answer is because EnderIO is fucking awesome
[2022-12-28 21:53:40] <%babyaddalyn> it will still fill the multismelter continuesly
[2022-12-28 21:53:48] <%Fufcia> Pati left for 30 minutes and Waffle is back to playing with Sand and Snad Kappa

[2022-12-28 21:54:14] <+Sentinel1_9> you need speed upgrades on those also @Giantwaffle
[2022-12-28 21:54:15] <+mdsooter> you use global ender chest freqs? or did they change the mod?
[2022-12-28 21:54:16] <%mechoriet> shouldn't it trigger on the end product and not the product you want to smelt?
[2022-12-28 21:54:17] <%$Tabakhase> worst placement possible YEP
[2022-12-28 21:54:30] <%babyaddalyn> ok :p
[2022-12-28 21:54:49] <%$Tabakhase> why even mess with that chest (what can now fill up pepeLaugh )
[2022-12-28 21:54:52] <+rofl1436> mechoriet it does in the lvl emitters
[2022-12-28 21:54:58] <SeaOfMadness_> can't you just use an import bus then?
[2022-12-28 21:54:58] <+Gamernxc> ender chest in floor?
[2022-12-28 21:54:58] <CoolReal> It will only smelt 1 type at a time tho
[2022-12-28 21:54:59] <Yakobro> @Giantwaffle ender conduits extract real slow compared to the speed of the multismelter, might try greg robot arm + filter?
[2022-12-28 21:55:00] <+Sentinel1_9> @Giantwaffle speed upgrades
[2022-12-28 21:55:30] <%$Tabakhase> call me lst here, but i got no clue why that enderchest is in that chain other than for making problems LUL
[2022-12-28 21:55:35] <thomasausen> why not use a import bus instead of conduit that should be faster right ?
[2022-12-28 21:55:44] <%mechoriet> pepeLaugh you have all the time right

[2022-12-28 21:56:04] <+Sentinel1_9> @Giantwaffle you should do a 2nd enderchest into it that you can put upstairs to throw stuff into you need smelted so it gets smelted and dumped into the me system

[2022-12-28 21:57:11] <+Sentinel1_9> @babyaddalyn hence the 2nd chest not the same chest
[2022-12-28 21:57:13] <+rofl1436> BBQgril it just does one thing after another, but its so fast it does not really matter
[2022-12-28 21:57:13] <+mdsooter> @Giantwaffle don't you need ender chest frequency protection?
[2022-12-28 21:57:26] <Filikeu> 9 at the same time, but u could have more

[2022-12-28 22:47:04] <+xDeadBringerx> @Giantwaffle Southwest's crew system isn't based on actual location but planned/scheduled location and trips and requires constant manual input to fix things up. So if a crew gets stuck the system needs manual intervention from the scheduling helpdesk to mark crew members as such so the system can recalculate the scheduling.
[2022-12-28 22:47:04] <%+Seerion> Firefox by far better

[2022-12-28 23:56:51] <+TheGeekPeek> does anyone know why the ME system + sign is grayed out even though I have all the ingredients? is that a glitch?
[2022-12-28 23:57:08] <Starmetal_> should be input
[2022-12-28 23:57:10] <%$frainsbreeze> it should be inputting this
[2022-12-28 23:57:13] <1killersquirrel> turn it around?
[2022-12-28 23:57:15] <%$frainsbreeze> make another memory card
[2022-12-28 23:57:20] <+Obliviron> but ur doing 32k x 5 but the pipe at the bottom is only 32k, making your output of 150k bottlenecked right?
[2022-12-28 23:57:34] <kypudo> find the first input you made and copy it
[2022-12-28 23:57:48] <fedeoeae> no, it means it is connected to the ME system on the outputside, it says 1 input right besides it
[2022-12-28 23:57:51] <Starmetal_> so p2p input here and p2p output where you have the main input p2p for power @Giantwaffle
[2022-12-28 23:57:57] <+Koeckie> @Obliviron p2p is 2k i think
[2022-12-28 23:57:59] <%babyaddalyn> do not make another channel!
[2022-12-28 23:58:09] <+Sentinel1_9> @Obliviron the cable has no limit the connections are what have the limit
