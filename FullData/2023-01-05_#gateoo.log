[2023-01-05 02:45:13] <@%^StreamElements> 1* (high priority) > 3* (Death prevention + 1* buff. Note if you have high Tian or invested in Tian get 3* Fen) > 5* (whale star and added dmg) > 6* (30% crit rate permanent on Fenrir and 5s when switched). Her matrices are really good if you can get them. If F2P pick between her or spearboi.

[2023-01-05 12:02:44] <$Ripperoniis> @Poosedge Often we say that three things are needed for a fire: fuel, oxygen, and ignition. This is called the "fire triangle." If you have all three things then you can have a fire.

[2023-01-05 12:03:02] <$Ripperoniis> @Poosedge Most fires will be put out when you add water--this typically removes two things from the triangle: ignition (heat) and oxygen.
