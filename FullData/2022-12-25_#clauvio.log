[2022-12-25 12:14:59] <Masuyuu> I did this game Keyboard only
[2022-12-25 12:15:04] <@%KafroHudrep> @SASVULTURE i'm pretty sure this is just the game's normal framerate
[2022-12-25 12:15:12] <Namington2D> But have you used the n64 controller?

[2022-12-25 12:15:31] <BlazeKong64> @KafroHudrep Yeah, this is the normal framerate for the game
[2022-12-25 12:15:32] <%BlueBlazeGX> I thought the N64 controller was fun to use, despite half of it being useless >.>
[2022-12-25 12:15:44] <%Frostova> goodbye friends clauviShy
[2022-12-25 12:15:45] <BoneMiser> the N64 controller was not intelligently designed. but it was memorable
[2022-12-25 12:15:46] <i_am_jessa> ope, I was joking about running away. I didn't realize there was an up coquiOGEY
[2022-12-25 12:15:57] <%BlueBlazeGX> It looked cool clauviSway

[2022-12-25 12:16:05] <BlazeKong64> By the way, speaking of the N64 controller, what was everyone's favorite way of holding the controller?
[2022-12-25 12:16:14] <papercompass> @Frostova take care
[2022-12-25 12:16:25] <%caltimoose> its to make clam juice

[2022-12-25 12:16:54] <+SASVULTURE> the N64 controler had some cool things, but the grindable stick was the worst
[2022-12-25 12:16:57] <%BlueBlazeGX> Idk clam anatomy
[2022-12-25 12:16:58] <@%KafroHudrep> clams are actually super clean.... they filter out bacteria by succing in the toxins and peeing clean water.........
[2022-12-25 12:17:08] <BlazeKong64> The stick on the N64 controller is really bad
