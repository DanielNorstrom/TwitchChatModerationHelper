[2022-12-26 13:17:42] <%Eunactes> which means if you're doing overgeared content like valtan or clown
[2022-12-26 13:17:47] <%Eunactes> spec summoner is better
[2022-12-26 13:17:51] <%Eunactes> because they die too fast

[2022-12-26 13:18:35] <%+deadlypants112> i jsut know swift is let your pets do damage spec is big spear and electric boi
[2022-12-26 13:19:14] <%Eunactes> yeah
[2022-12-26 13:19:20] <%Eunactes> spec is the one where you do cool combo

[2022-12-26 13:25:32] <altruvice> @SilkyThokks yes, that's why i said he is just playing better than the people in the raid. but that does not mean that the kia is faster by standard empirical metrics

[2022-12-26 15:56:22] <Transcendence> @dante_afton you can switch mains even if we are at brel normal now, much less the fact that your ilvl is 1450 and you're barely dipping ur toes into legion raids
[2022-12-26 15:56:26] <oAchelous> issue is, not a burst class Sadge

[2022-12-26 16:07:21] <%+weirdflavour> @weirdflavour I tested it out on trixion, overall its nearly the same damage, i bought a new neclace and it just feels better not because of movement. You just provide much more buffs for the team because you are in boundless mp mode most of the time. You can cast nella, taunt every 15s and shield breaks every 5 seconds
