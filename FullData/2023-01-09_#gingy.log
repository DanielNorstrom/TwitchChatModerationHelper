[2023-01-09 14:20:06] <%+mr_ax> Speaking of challenges, Kappa and stuff... I really liked the 100 million in 100 scavs challenge you did way back. To not do the same thing, and to maybe not bore you to death, an idea for a change would be to do something like "20 million in one 8h stream session, scavs only" or something like that? (just thinking out load)

[2023-01-09 15:24:23] <%Meecrob_tv> all clear bra LUL @reigndear1
[2023-01-09 15:24:31] <+mcfurrow> Other channels have the option for chat to silence attention seekers for 10 mins using channel points. Wish I could do that right now. . .
[2023-01-09 15:24:32] <%StoneValleyKing> well @reigndear1 hold your breathe until the ok. Thanks

[2023-01-09 15:25:08] <+Megidus_> So this guy says he sells cheats and his business model is to sell cheats and then rat to BSG? Smooth brain

[2023-01-09 15:25:16] <reigndear1> @humanitas_ if she’s not banned then BSG need to check DM’s
[2023-01-09 15:25:17] <+dakerse973> Professor Gingy has reported to EFT 101 for the day lol
[2023-01-09 15:25:23] <%Kreezaa> apparently having eyes + ears + map awareness is cheating
[2023-01-09 15:25:25] <+johnnylaw59> you do anything for 11k hours your gonna get good at it, works most things in life

[2023-01-09 15:25:47] <+budmoon1> @megidus_ yeah but he can just write many more lines of code to cheat. because that's obviously how it works
[2023-01-09 15:25:53] <@%+jimmiedrum> id feel that BSG vet the people they give streamer items pretty well @reigndear1 ....
[2023-01-09 15:25:54] <%nopeboats> @Kreezaa having a nose is a nose job so what is having a mouth
[2023-01-09 15:25:55] <humanitas_> @reigndear1 So there's NO chance in this case that you're actually wrong? Either she's banned or BSG is not doing their job? I feel like you're being very unfair
[2023-01-09 15:26:01] <Neffeleptic> @Megidus_ he sells bad cheats too, so already had a bad business model
[2023-01-09 15:26:03] <Leiksa_> you need that 15 key that is one floor below you

[2023-01-09 15:30:45] <shakenbake38s> you can repair them to almost full I guess
[2023-01-09 15:30:46] <%$Alex_2CC> probably so that you can repair them and use them
[2023-01-09 15:31:05] <KeenF_Studios> is this the intended way the scav guns are to suppose to be now so it makes sense to repair them? LUL

[2023-01-09 15:42:25] <FastBullet007> @FastBullet007 There is no K/D in atm that only looks at player v player it has scavs mixed in atm so that stat is garbo atm. ATM there is no stat that shows how good you are. A player with 25% S/R that focuses hunting players vs me in the high 60 low 70% where I prio looting and questing over pvp is much better at the game then me IMO.

[2023-01-09 16:32:13] <%+iImagineWagons> @jwmishka710 personally think they're trying to make it more difficult and less enjoyable for the casual players... I think most of the ammo changes are probably okay minus M80, but its annoying that they didnt do these changes at the beginning of wipe... i finished grenadier only to have bp revoked from me and probably wont have any other compensation from bsg for that inconvenience
[2023-01-09 16:32:17] <cripplergaming> @noreseto I agree
[2023-01-09 16:32:45] <+Noreseto> Some people exagerate the number of cheaters but a lot of people are honestly in big denial, the game has a massive cheating issue

[2023-01-09 17:31:36] <KarshelS> @sykodude24 yeah, I just suck at pvp at this point, so scav is like a trainer for me :)  but if scaves are killing scavs that handicaps it a bit

[2023-01-09 17:35:20] <Sandman3279> so it makes it easier for lower level players to survive becsuse they aren't constantly getting destroyed by the chads with the good ammo. because if a super high level player has access to BP for example they grinded up for it

[2023-01-09 18:42:36] <+stonepiece0078> Is the lexos key worth anything

[2023-01-09 18:43:39] <+adderall_chan> 50k is therapist price, it will jump on flea when they lower the chances for the gingy keychain
[2023-01-09 18:43:45] <hennymeeh> shot santa the first raid in the darkness as a pmc, took a long time to get it positive again :D

[2023-01-09 18:45:16] <%$MagicMeech> i just want my b100 ak grip
[2023-01-09 18:45:16] <dewberto69> @InuyashaITB That too
[2023-01-09 18:45:17] <+KlyRu_> You can still buy scopes on flea, minor change

[2023-01-09 18:45:56] <%CallMeSleeepy> this is the greatest change in tarkov in the last 2-3 years
[2023-01-09 18:45:57] <+vilidrex> I think making any crazy powerful attachment crafting or really expensive is really good for the health of the game
[2023-01-09 18:45:59] <amishfury> Flea for barters items only!
[2023-01-09 18:45:59] <+stonepiece0078> You should have to find in raid things
[2023-01-09 18:46:00] <+Boomstix225> Itll make you value everything more
[2023-01-09 18:46:01] <Colorswift> there is a tan one you can buy from jaegar that is good
[2023-01-09 18:46:02] <%+Vedavolta> that stuff should be only found in raid
[2023-01-09 18:46:03] <+swaggy_sid> i started playing with a scope and it is a GAME CHANGER
[2023-01-09 18:46:07] <+MoHi___> that is true
[2023-01-09 18:46:07] <+swamain> hello Gingy. I 100% agree
[2023-01-09 18:46:12] <creatingkurt> i agree wipe is only fun for like 3 weeks
[2023-01-09 18:46:13] <%+Vedavolta> kids should be made and acquired, not bought
[2023-01-09 18:46:14] <%+InuyashaITB> the scopes give sooo much power
[2023-01-09 18:46:15] <+Dom123> i agree with the ammo not the scopes though
[2023-01-09 18:46:16] <+TenDogg> its hard for people that dont play as many hours but still want to enjoy the game
[2023-01-09 18:46:22] <%+PapaTomss> you just put people who dont play all day every day at a major disadvantage

[2023-01-09 18:46:30] <!%MissJessMJM> I think it would only prolong the wipe for Casuals though.

[2023-01-09 18:47:22] <senor_chungus> its only going to prolong things for the people who career the game though, how about streamers and people who put more than 8 hours a day into the game get locked vendors

[2023-01-09 18:48:02] <%+NattyNatty2x4> srs make all the hyper good shit not buyable from traders or flea so that the end game stuff isn't the default, it's special
[2023-01-09 18:48:02] <%+thomas8man> french
[2023-01-09 18:48:03] <+thebski> I think it just provides more and more incentive to cheat. the further out if reach they put the good stuff the more the average player is faced with the decision to cheat or stop playing. it's not realistic for the average person to grind enough to access good stuff anymore

[2023-01-09 18:48:43] <SatolboGT> @thebski i don't think anyone is faced with that decision - not everyone expects to be a chad if they play casually

[2023-01-09 18:50:26] <+thebski> I'm just telling it how it is. everytime they put better gear further out of reach its just going to push more people to cheat. it also provides less incentive to grind because you're not going to get there no matter how much you grind

[2023-01-09 19:35:14] <%WitchyKittyy> this is not casual friendly game. if you want casual play cod
[2023-01-09 19:35:17] <+Sirrealkilla> ammo changes cater to people with more time aka not the common player
[2023-01-09 19:35:19] <Spanky4277> lol found all scavs on the map in 1 spot
[2023-01-09 19:35:20] <kiwipoptv> where those player scavs?
[2023-01-09 19:35:22] <%BennyBritishman> the streamers arent even the people to be worried about most of them dont even rush levels, far more grinders that arent in the public eye
[2023-01-09 19:35:27] <rocksender> theres a reason why im watching you and not playing because being casual in this game just means you get pumped
[2023-01-09 19:35:27] <+Alpha48433> @xsadporkyx that would kill the game lol

[2023-01-09 19:36:10] <xsadporkyx> @Alpha48433 well sounds like a bad game... they can add new content with out wiping the game. plus once the game is finished they said wiping will stop
[2023-01-09 19:36:24] <xmrmackeyxx> casuals will defintely not enjoy this game, itll be more punishing than naything else. this game is not supposed to be fun
[2023-01-09 19:36:39] <%ivienotme> what is considered casual?
[2023-01-09 19:36:41] <Androidonator> it just means you will get shafted sometimes
[2023-01-09 19:36:41] <%WitchyKittyy> @Shrumdog what do you mean? this game is not casual player friendly. cod you can get on and play once a week and you wont be set back in gear than anyone else
[2023-01-09 19:36:45] <%+BongoBongolo> they need to have an ammo in between ps and bp because it doesnt make sense

[2023-01-09 19:36:52] <PeteyRete> @Alpha48433 wiping is part of the game homie. Early wipe is some of the funnest times in this game
[2023-01-09 19:36:56] <+Alpha48433> @xsadporkyx Don't like it? Don't play. The game in its current state would not work without a wipe.
[2023-01-09 19:36:56] <Nathrach> Honestly i'm more of a casual player and I have had no problems with the over all speed of the game. Being casual tends to mean you need to be about 60% rat 40% chad if you really want to make it work right.
[2023-01-09 19:36:57] <sheepsc> casuals have trouble killing scavs Kappa
[2023-01-09 19:37:04] <xmrmackeyxx> casual would be like 4-7 hours a week
[2023-01-09 19:37:16] <+latebreakfast> you cant bruteforce roubles as casual
[2023-01-09 19:37:24] <xsadporkyx> @Alpha48433 i dont play i only watch now. cant stand doing the came quest over and over XD
[2023-01-09 19:37:25] <+Sirrealkilla> @ogjoker88 thats a joke not nearly enough to sustain multiple labs runs players would have to grind one map forcing people back all on reserve killing options
[2023-01-09 19:37:25] <Shrumdog> @WitchyKittyy i mean the player base is much more friendly imo. when was the last time you were in a cod lobby? shit is toxic af  easy for casuals, no. kinder playerbase, yes
[2023-01-09 19:37:46] <@%+LilPoopGod> @xmrmackeyxx even like 20 hours could be considered casual in tarkov imo
[2023-01-09 19:37:54] <+Alpha48433> @xsadporkyx then i guess its irrelevant lmao
[2023-01-09 19:37:59] <%ogjoker88> @Sirrealkilla Cant run lab''s back to back anyway so your point?
[2023-01-09 19:38:00] <Androidonator> its easy because of sbmm and controller aim assist
[2023-01-09 19:38:01] <%BennyBritishman> Also guarantee 90% of the casuals have never tried to speak their way out of death, so much mercy in this game
[2023-01-09 19:38:02] <Endoflife911> @Shrumdog not even cod, try playing rust XD so toxic XD
[2023-01-09 19:38:06] <kiwipoptv> As someone who just started, it definitely wouldn't have been possible without my friend who has 1k+ hrs on the game
