[2023-01-09 14:14:41] <+dondappa16> am I the only hear who think castro took that very well , chunky basically took 20k of a cards value , I'd be flipping regardless of money
[2023-01-09 14:14:46] <bigfoot1258> @samb101018 what happend? i whas just too late to see what happend
[2023-01-09 14:15:04] <@%$iBeastVii> He won't ever sell the Messi so it doesn't matter
[2023-01-09 14:15:04] <rygn922> @howdyitsdavid i feels like for my skill level, i will utilise jairzinho better than zizzou, im not that good at skill move

[2023-01-09 14:15:37] <samb101018> @bigfoot1258 chunky took off the sticker of authenticity off the card and opened the case, basically losing all of its value
[2023-01-09 14:15:37] <+howdyitsdavid> @rygn922 Im not either. haha.
[2023-01-09 14:15:43] <+dondappa16> why use messi as your tester though ?
[2023-01-09 14:15:45] <%BoyRobErtson19> I don‚Äôt blame him, I would have done the same
[2023-01-09 14:16:03] <@%$iBeastVii> He had no idea

[2023-01-09 14:16:13] <@%$iBeastVii> It was a harmless, expensive mistake

[2023-01-09 14:16:22] <@%$iBeastVii> But Castro won't ever sell it so it doesn't matter
[2023-01-09 14:16:31] <samb101018> Just frustrating I guess
[2023-01-09 14:16:34] <+howdyitsdavid> he replaced my 90 capita. Trent is really good.
[2023-01-09 14:16:41] <+dondappa16> I'm sorry , if u pay 15k for a box of cards , common sense tells u , I better not take this case of this 20k messi
