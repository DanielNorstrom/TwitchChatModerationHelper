[2022-12-09 15:53:07] <@%ziolxx> chrome devs announced that they will be changing their software in 2023 to something which will make adblockers harder to implement
[2022-12-09 15:53:20] <dextermorganfreeman> why 1st or 4th?
[2022-12-09 15:53:20] <@%+Weirdgus> @ziolxx is this a joke?

[2022-12-09 15:53:56] <%funny994> Isn‚Äôt this quest bad with pirates since the animations is long af?
[2022-12-09 15:53:58] <@%+Weirdgus> @Golgothanus I used to be on firefox but it was buggy witgh 7tv

[2022-12-09 15:54:48] <%+Golgothanus> @Weirdgus worst thing is that it's not just Chrome, but all the browsers built on Chromium. So Opera, Edge, Safari etc are gonna be affected
[2022-12-09 15:54:48] <%ThanozofTitan> What if they did a rotation of Quests, buddies and prizes? and it was EXTRA random lol

[2022-12-09 16:47:39] <%+Gripeaway> @RduLIVE I think you had conflicting goals. When you saw George, if you're going to roll for blaster, you shouldn't buy fort. Otherwise you should also buy menace.
[2022-12-09 16:47:41] <ninjaw1> I think you forgot to consider that chat can see into the future :)
