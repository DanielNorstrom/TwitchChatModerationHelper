[2023-01-05 16:57:18] <@^Nightbot> My favorite character is the reaper guy. he is very powerfull. special move, honestly is one of the best in the game and so he comes equipped with these two revolvers and only takes about 3 or 4 shots to actually execute a kill so it comes really in handy specially when you come from the side

[2023-01-05 19:21:56] <%alaviiva__> now you'll be stuck at 6k sr PagMan
[2023-01-05 19:21:57] <minounn> not a bug, but a feature
[2023-01-05 19:22:04] <%thelaziest78> Imagine unlimited sr
[2023-01-05 19:22:05] <kasper93> no cap
[2023-01-05 19:22:09] <rasp_ow> you can play 10k games with 51% winrate to get 5k
[2023-01-05 19:22:10] <minounn> nah they will just double the cap
[2023-01-05 19:22:11] <xyzYoussef> they can just revert it to ow1 system
[2023-01-05 19:22:17] <%thelaziest78> like ppl can get 10k, 29k
[2023-01-05 19:22:24] <sirgoulas> what cap?
[2023-01-05 19:22:37] <%YoungsterGlenn> If it's like Apex that's awful
[2023-01-05 19:22:55] <%YoungsterGlenn> The rank system only shows which top 30 player played the most not who's best

[2023-01-05 19:23:10] <doodooboiiiiiiii> mm def not u cant climb past 5k pre much
[2023-01-05 19:23:12] <KnocksFPS> Apex you can go as high as u want but u lose more ranked points higher in the ladder
[2023-01-05 19:23:23] <%MintJamz> They are gonna fuck it up somehow
[2023-01-05 19:23:29] <doodooboiiiiiiii> no for apex i mean

[2023-01-05 19:23:58] <minounn> Pepelaugh its blizzard
[2023-01-05 19:24:10] <avoidthestalk> with zero decay too
[2023-01-05 19:24:13] <kasper93> agreed, they fuck up bad
[2023-01-05 19:24:19] <Janolt_ow> if theres no cap, and ur like 6k wouldnt that just make qs 10h long
[2023-01-05 19:24:22] <shud_as_genji> ill tell u in 40 min..
[2023-01-05 19:24:24] <%YoungsterGlenn> Make it decay each hour not played
[2023-01-05 19:24:28] <beissi555> they remove sr completely and matchmaker just randomly places ppl in games :)
[2023-01-05 19:24:29] <+Kettlez> #1 should have nothing to do with what level ur account is
[2023-01-05 19:24:31] <!%Beggare94> its ok u killed all the mines
[2023-01-05 19:24:32] <%MintJamz> You get matched with actual diamonds as a top 10 player
[2023-01-05 19:24:39] <Jrspartan> fk it you cleared mines
[2023-01-05 19:24:59] <%MintJamz> Then what about plats or golds?
[2023-01-05 19:25:04] <%GIRLinMaleBody> every dps is short
[2023-01-05 19:25:06] <Janolt_ow> yeah but uncapped sr makes qs longer

[2023-01-05 19:25:53] <%MintJamz> It's horrible to have top 500 players and plats in the same lobby, the games are extremely unbalanced
[2023-01-05 19:26:17] <%MintJamz> I did in ow1 as a support

[2023-01-05 19:29:46] <%+Aceattack> your complaints are legit but top500 issues are rich ppl problems atm. without fixing matchmaking game is in a worse spot

[2023-01-05 19:30:56] <@%$PayMeToThrow> why else would you play ranked
[2023-01-05 19:30:57] <%+Aceattack> what you are saying is legit but it’s rich people problem
[2023-01-05 19:30:58] <%+MorgothPlays> No newcomer can get rank more less 20 in NA

[2023-01-05 19:31:23] <+Kettlez> it should be fair with anyone who can get rank 1, the fact it doesnt work like that is silly
[2023-01-05 19:31:34] <%GIRLinMaleBody> ye
[2023-01-05 19:31:38] <Janolt_ow> new ow2 acc can never reach rank 1 and thats kinda stupid for a competitive game

[2023-01-05 19:31:42] <beissi555> it has always worked like that?
[2023-01-05 19:31:47] <%GIRLinMaleBody> @beissi555 no
[2023-01-05 19:31:53] <tendiesPls> then why do I get matched with golds and masters players?
[2023-01-05 19:31:54] <!%Beggare94> it doesnt matter if its a rich peoples problem, it may be low priority but its like the easiest fucking fix
[2023-01-05 19:31:59] <beissi555> @GIRLinMaleBody pretty sure it has been like that always
[2023-01-05 19:32:00] <%+MorgothPlays> @Aceattack I mean everyone right now on twitch, even wathers are rich, from global perspective
[2023-01-05 19:32:04] <z0ne__> ye rank means nothing im masters and only get gm lobbies
[2023-01-05 19:32:04] <@%$PayMeToThrow> basing rank off a game that doesn't exist anymore is just all wrong
[2023-01-05 19:32:06] <%YoungsterGlenn> If it was hard to fix it'd probably be low priority but surely it's super easy to fix lol
[2023-01-05 19:32:09] <shud_as_genji> you pussies need to grind instead of quitting because of qp
[2023-01-05 19:32:13] <trixiexo> what's the point of hidden mmr, why not make it visible
[2023-01-05 19:32:34] <ThisIsSnex> its the same in league, cant really see your mmr
[2023-01-05 19:32:36] <%+MorgothPlays> yeah, it's stupid also for lower ranks - I was plat end of season, I still have probably plat MMR, but I am gold now
[2023-01-05 19:32:41] <%anung> huh tell me about it Clueless
[2023-01-05 19:32:42] <!%Beggare94> its an easy fix way easier than mm fix everyone is asking for so they will do it. removing a cap in code is easy
[2023-01-05 19:32:45] <minounn> "surprise mechanic" Kappa
[2023-01-05 19:33:09] <%YoungsterGlenn> MMR is hidden because it doesn't behave as nice and would probably frustrate people to see

[2023-01-05 19:35:34] <sirgoulas> remove sr then have only mmr
[2023-01-05 19:35:35] <doctorleche> makes ur team say "their X dps is high rank, focus them"

[2023-01-05 19:35:50] <+Kettlez> some people tilt when they see a grandmaster in their game but they're a support main on dps
[2023-01-05 19:35:53] <kaymaroarts> one more thing to verbally abuse team about
[2023-01-05 19:36:07] <doctorleche> how can they show STATS but not ranks and think its less toxic.......
[2023-01-05 19:36:10] <!%Beggare94> if u show only team sr, u wont know which player is high since ranks are hidden
[2023-01-05 19:36:20] <+Kettlez> it says "grandmaster challenger" or whatever
[2023-01-05 19:36:21] <adrenTX> if i see that their tank is masters, then i know they will fall for dumb stuff
[2023-01-05 19:36:42] <+Kettlez> Yeah I know you do not, but it effects the mindset of the enemy team an can tilt them
[2023-01-05 19:36:44] <@%$PayMeToThrow> titles are from last season too and can come from open queue
[2023-01-05 19:37:01] <!%Beggare94> @PayMeToThrow or different roles

[2023-01-05 19:39:36] <%epickio> whats important for dps?
[2023-01-05 19:39:49] <ashley_yea> top 500 yeah it should be instant
[2023-01-05 19:39:49] <ThisIsSnex> for tank its the same, dont die 4Head
[2023-01-05 19:39:58] <%AbortionOW> i love that i have to play 7 games to see my reward :)
[2023-01-05 19:40:05] <%YoungsterGlenn> Doesn't make much sense in top 500 since can already tell what rank you should be from the leaderboards
[2023-01-05 19:40:15] <+isnt_henry> @epickio i'd say applying pressure to the enemy and not dying as a general tip for dps
[2023-01-05 19:40:28] <generalvonroom> supports want to survive, dps want to kill and tank wants to help them do both
[2023-01-05 19:40:29] <tendiesPls> I think what is frustrating for people is most games feel like a roll or get rolled
[2023-01-05 19:40:48] <ladyman111> so dannedd playstyle?
[2023-01-05 19:40:54] <xblaze5_> Yeah I rather dps die more than tank
[2023-01-05 19:41:00] <%Postknowledge> the unmotivating thing for me is I am plat playing in masters lobbies, but even if I get long win streaks I still increase my SR at the same rate as a plat playing in plat lobbies
[2023-01-05 19:41:00] <%tokekberacun> a trade is MINIMUM as dps, i feel that as a tank
[2023-01-05 19:41:16] VIEWERS: 391

[2023-01-05 19:41:27] <xblaze5_> Correct
[2023-01-05 19:41:41] <+isnt_henry> you dont have to get kills as a dps if you manage to pressure the enemy tank down
[2023-01-05 19:41:48] <%thelaziest78> How to carry as a tank while enemy widow kills 2 before fight every time?
[2023-01-05 19:41:51] <keiytan> Trading is bad i think if you have a way longer way from you respawn than the enemy team

[2023-01-05 19:44:37] <ladyman111> @Lilltornis at the start of the game that is what it meant but as the supports evolved the terminology changed
[2023-01-05 19:44:45] <%YoungsterGlenn> Main/flex is a pro play division so it's just a historical thing

[2023-01-05 19:45:20] <generalvonroom> pog
[2023-01-05 19:45:33] <xblaze5_> That’s a fair outlook
[2023-01-05 19:45:33] <+AGirlCalledJim> Main support = made up, main heal = real
[2023-01-05 19:45:33] <%tokekberacun> what makes brig main support, or did i misheard
[2023-01-05 19:45:34] <!%Beggare94> why is chat braindead today ?
[2023-01-05 19:45:36] <sirgoulas> main healer makes more sense than flex main support gibberish tbh
[2023-01-05 19:45:40] <luazri> usually flex support are heroes that require mechanical skill, excluding moira ofc
[2023-01-05 19:45:44] <Lilltornis> ye but im heard mainhealer alot when i was plat in ow1 so it just stuck i guess
[2023-01-05 19:45:54] <ashley_yea> WHY
[2023-01-05 19:45:56] <%MintJamz> and Moira
[2023-01-05 19:45:57] <%anung> Flex support is something that exists and no one knows what it means
[2023-01-05 19:46:00] <ashley_yea> PLS IM SO CONFUSED

[2023-01-05 19:46:01] <!%Beggare94> whoever called zen main support aint braindead ?
[2023-01-05 19:46:06] <keiytan> I think flex supports get their value by Utility like Antinade, main support get their value by healing
[2023-01-05 19:46:15] <xblaze5_> Lol
[2023-01-05 19:46:19] <%YoungsterGlenn> Main healer is a sign you're in plat
[2023-01-05 19:46:20] <%Magicturtle12> i thought brig was supposed to protect the main support

[2023-01-05 19:48:03] <luazri> the word "main healer" makes no sense, you're assuming that supports only do healing

[2023-01-05 19:48:28] <+Kettlez> In my mind it's a support that doesn't have strong heals to sustain fights
[2023-01-05 19:48:35] <sirgoulas> @luazri it makes sense. is healing output. the other terminology makes no sense
[2023-01-05 19:48:40] <+AGirlCalledJim> @luazri no it means they're expected to do more of the healing while the other focuses on utility... e.g. Mercy dmg boost, Lucio speed

[2023-01-05 19:49:12] <Beastehh> people want an excuse as to why their healing is shit so they call it flex
[2023-01-05 19:49:15] <%YoungsterGlenn> The word just means "does RJH or Tobi play this hero"
[2023-01-05 19:49:18] VIEWERS: 423

[2023-01-05 20:24:51] <%Nevs_H200OW> and monitor counts as player
[2023-01-05 20:24:53] <tirdni> @LhCloudy27 its 2 sec less per enemy. so basically if she swings into 4-5 enemies, she swings forever
[2023-01-05 20:24:53] <%senapena> @LhCloudy27 Adrenaline Rush (Passive) - Now heals from remaining Wound effects when an enemy dies while the Wound effect remains. Carnage - Cooldown is reduced by 2 seconds per enemy hit. Jagged Blade - Direct damage when thrown reduced from 80 to 50. - When thrown adds 30 additional Wound damage to targets that are pinned by the knife. Can be stacked with Wound caused by punching a knife. or from pulling the knife back.
[2023-01-05 20:24:53] <rasp_ow> monitors buff
[2023-01-05 20:24:54] <mushcamando> well does it really matter if it's bugged with the monitors? would it even be useful practically

[2023-01-05 20:25:01] <PikeTheLegend_> ***

[2023-01-05 21:04:54] <%ShaiDied> The obv answer is to change the voice line for the person using the skin, but not for other players
[2023-01-05 21:05:01] <+Kettlez> I dont think it's bad so long as the ult voiceline is the same length as the original else it could give an advantage

[2023-01-05 22:53:19] <@^Nightbot> My favorite character is the reaper guy. he is very powerfull. special move, honestly is one of the best in the game and so he comes equipped with these two revolvers and only takes about 3 or 4 shots to actually execute a kill so it comes really in handy specially when you come from the side
[2023-01-05 22:53:48] <+Kettlez> was pretty fun watching you stress over lucios an being frozen by widow lmao
