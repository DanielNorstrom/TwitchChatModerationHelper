THATS NOT PLAYING DDR. holding the damn bar and barely moving your feet is not playing god damn ddr. At that point why even use the pad? just use a controller, its exactly the same level as playing ddr. either do it correctly or dont do it. otherwise you are just saying " i managed to trigger all the arrows, so i played ddr right?" do you wanna play ddr? or just trigger the arrows? they arent the same damn thing.

[2022-12-22 02:38:50] <%goldreaver> I once almost choked to death while eating pasta. I did my own research and discovered that I am not alone.

Now plenty of people will point out that there are others ways of choking but I'm not gonna feed my kids Cirno's Long Drive runs either so it's all good.

[2022-12-22 08:08:29] <%ZsnakeX> cirPrise uhh
[2022-12-22 08:09:25] <%ZsnakeX> CirnoShrug i cant help with the dying, but for 6 evo weapons i usually plan that out ahead when picking my survivor
[2022-12-22 08:10:03] <%AchievementSlayer> I managed to get 5 weapons evolved but time ran out before I could evolve the 6th

[2022-12-22 08:12:19] <%ZsnakeX> cirThink
[2022-12-22 08:12:55] <%ZsnakeX> for me its also kinda stage dependent as for when i get my full evolutions
[2022-12-22 08:13:12] <%ZsnakeX> like one stage will be maxed out in 15mins, others in 20+
[2022-12-22 08:17:12] <%AchievementSlayer> which stage + character gives you the best results?
[2022-12-22 08:17:17] <%AchievementSlayer> NOTED
[2022-12-22 08:18:00] <%ZsnakeX> character doesnt matter for me
[2022-12-22 08:18:18] <%ZsnakeX> but recently for unlocking stuff, i've been doing library
[2022-12-22 08:18:55] <%ZsnakeX> cirPrise how far are you currently Slayer
[2022-12-22 08:19:38] <%AchievementSlayer> I just shut off my XBox cirSlain I fogor
[2022-12-22 08:20:08] <%AchievementSlayer> I have unlocked the rings and the left and right magento things
[2022-12-22 08:21:07] <%ZsnakeX> NOTED do you have hyper/hurry mode unlocked?
[2022-12-22 08:22:13] <%AchievementSlayer> yes
[2022-12-22 08:23:51] <%ZsnakeX> so idk if you're trying to unlock anything currently but Hyper/Hurry Library is my go to stage
[2022-12-22 08:24:17] <%AchievementSlayer> I need to unlock that cursed gold bar thing
[2022-12-22 08:24:25] <%ZsnakeX> as the corridor is simple enough to use AoE items and camp in the center of the screen
[2022-12-22 08:24:57] <%ZsnakeX> NOTED oh that thing
[2022-12-22 08:26:55] <%ZsnakeX> oh and for the ring/magno red things, its better to unlock one at a time rather than both
[2022-12-22 08:27:33] <%ZsnakeX> e.g either grab both red things and skip rings or vice versa if you wanna do thier unlocks
[2022-12-22 08:27:51] <%ZsnakeX> cirSlain cause i've tried and its not fun
[2022-12-22 08:29:46] <%ZsnakeX> cirISee and for the dying part, really i guess the only thing you can do is try to synergize your weapons
[2022-12-22 08:31:39] <%ZsnakeX> some of my go to weapons are magic wand/axe/knife with their evo items
[2022-12-22 08:33:00] <%ZsnakeX> CirnoShrug but then again try to match with w/e your character choice is
[2022-12-22 08:33:21] <%AchievementSlayer> NOTED Wand, Axe, Knife...

[2022-12-22 22:52:36] <Niezzer_> Maybe you not the standard chatterino/dankchat etc is what makes the difference

[2022-12-22 22:53:36] <%insofaras> @Niezzer_ not any more. I think early-on it was based on presence in chat and I got quite a few - but pretty sure they've changed it to require watching now
