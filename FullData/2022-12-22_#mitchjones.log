[2022-12-22 01:42:41] <+phlie> RAID: Shadow Legends™️ is an immersive online experience with everything you'd expect from a brand new RPG title. It's got an amazing storyline, awesome 3D graphics, giant boss fights, PVP battles, and hundreds of never before seen champions to collect and customize. I never expected to get this level of performance out of a mobile game. Look how crazy the level of detail is on these champions!

[2022-12-22 23:33:11] <rockaeroooo> yo mitch I sent you a message on skype. If you want advice I have some good ones. so we can talk off stream like 2 bros even if you don't know me and I can definitely tell you what you need to do. because I've been through what you are going through and now I'm perfectly fine. just let me know, love you bro ❤
[2022-12-22 23:53:20] <+Acepoepsnor> Remember what you did
[2022-12-22 23:53:25] <ArnoKitteh> I wonder why he killed Reckful
