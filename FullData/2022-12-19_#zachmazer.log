[2022-12-19 05:45:43] <zodiacRex> I think if Finals was like 2 or 3 games longer Optic would've qualled
[2022-12-19 05:45:45] [Notification] zDevilsfood subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months!

[2022-12-19 05:47:01] <yeezyreloaded> He meant they would‚Äôve won
[2022-12-19 05:47:03] <+hasooba28> if optic didnt grief reps then ESA wounld't have won because tsm were winning the fight
[2022-12-19 05:47:16] <%+zDevilsfood> Def could have won one, they were playing well today
[2022-12-19 05:47:17] <zodiacRex> oh I meant they could've won through MP
[2022-12-19 05:47:57] <syszkc> I remember when people used to be scare of fighting G2, now they just get evaporated

[2022-12-19 05:49:18] <%OldManMuppet> I wanted complexity to qual so bad. Land  is better with Monsoon in it
[2022-12-19 05:49:18] <RivaIed> optic not going is crazy
[2022-12-19 05:49:41] <%+zDevilsfood> I still dont get why of all people tripods decided to contest both optic and esa today

[2022-12-19 05:52:09] <Minndx> idk why faze is trying to switch up comps so much as an excuse for their macro issues

[2022-12-19 05:52:17] <Minndx> their issue isn't comp

[2022-12-19 05:52:44] <nftiddy> @flyingpurplepath nope missed lan
[2022-12-19 05:52:48] <%+BDinoScoutSpammer> Getting Naughty and Slurp on the same team and not playing edge is kinda troll imo
[2022-12-19 05:52:49] <%OldManMuppet> @Minndx They change there landing spots to so there comp has alot to do with that
[2022-12-19 05:53:07] <flyingpurplepath> damn and they were so good last year that's crazy @nftiddy
[2022-12-19 05:53:11] <+imcrihn> What is going on
[2022-12-19 05:53:29] <Minndx> @OldManMuppet well this comp has nothing to do with their drop spot, this comp is just blatantly atrocious
[2022-12-19 05:53:38] <%+zDevilsfood> optic review gonna be fun LUL gonna see them deal with all the shenanigans from pods and g2
[2022-12-19 05:53:41] <ok_arturrr> tsm was trolling cuz they already qualed no point watching

[2022-12-19 06:11:59] <JetScream69> @zachmazer It didnt bug, cuz of the way he threw it it took longer to activate. U can see if in enemy pov after they die
[2022-12-19 06:12:10] <%pray4jeremy> @biggseyec correct
[2022-12-19 06:12:10] <cr4kf0x> LuL
[2022-12-19 06:12:11] <%+zDevilsfood> @biggseyec they finished in 20th overall
[2022-12-19 06:12:16] <+DiggySD> gave them a chance maybe
[2022-12-19 06:12:18] <+confident_cake> They were still dead imo
[2022-12-19 06:12:20] <+biggseyec> Sadge
[2022-12-19 06:12:21] <+Dillbitmaaate> nah no chance
[2022-12-19 06:12:25] <%warlord5186> that wouldn't have saved them at all
[2022-12-19 06:12:26] <+Dillbitmaaate> shot from two angles
[2022-12-19 06:12:29] <tiptop069> its sliding off ever so slowly low
[2022-12-19 06:12:29] <prettyboy2103> It‚Äôs Genburton you can‚Äôt beat him
[2022-12-19 06:12:33] <yeezyreloaded> He had good res they would‚Äôve won
[2022-12-19 06:12:45] <%+zDevilsfood> Q'ing on uneven rocks always a hit or miss on newcastle
[2022-12-19 06:12:47] <+DiggySD> if the just held tracks with castle wall the win this game
[2022-12-19 06:12:49] <hey_its_slater> That Q was actually bad
[2022-12-19 06:13:06] <C1yd3fr0g> they are 100% dead but bug provides pure cut copium
[2022-12-19 06:13:09] <d1v1vneyt> Gold res could sheild other side
[2022-12-19 06:13:14] <+VLAZVELD> i think mac is thinking q saves from then snipes knockdown safves back
[2022-12-19 06:13:16] <phoenixsuns1994> Why did they not just fight dz
[2022-12-19 06:13:17] <%+zDevilsfood> it wouldnt have saved him
[2022-12-19 06:13:23] <+VLAZVELD> back
[2022-12-19 06:13:23] <420aabuser> they should just ap them
[2022-12-19 06:13:34] <%+zDevilsfood> theres a delay for the shield coming up once its landed
[2022-12-19 06:13:38] <+VLAZVELD> makes sense @zachmazer
[2022-12-19 06:13:43] <%basic_pancake> NC tac should‚Äôve been put down sooner and facing the other way imo
[2022-12-19 06:13:51] <Jargenmach> would still give them an opportunity
[2022-12-19 06:13:51] <kabeee710> all three were cracked on Dz
[2022-12-19 06:13:52] <%basic_pancake> But DZ being right there‚Ä¶ idk
[2022-12-19 06:13:56] <Liquid_Arisu> What if it‚Äôs facing the tracks and he res facing dz?
[2022-12-19 06:14:04] <zodiacRex> yeah they were dead either way
[2022-12-19 06:14:16] <hey_its_slater> DZ would have puished because DZ had that whole section of the mpa to themselves
[2022-12-19 06:14:23] <+Ares_Reaper> DZ didnt get the knock on Snip3 so would they know to wrap during rez?
[2022-12-19 06:14:23] <prettyboy2103> Do you think DZ will 3 peat at Lan?
[2022-12-19 06:14:50] <realbackwoods> REPTHESET
[2022-12-19 06:14:54] <+DiggySD> tbh man the just ran around this spot clueless looking for kills
[2022-12-19 06:14:54] <kabeee710> @prettyboy2103 DZ barely qualified
[2022-12-19 06:14:57] <%pray4jeremy> I want DZ to 3 peat so the weirdos who keep trolling their performance in NA can cry some more

[2022-12-19 06:19:05] <prettyboy2103> @phoenixsuns1994 they seem really bad at team fighting. Then seem to lose every 3v3
[2022-12-19 06:19:05] <d1v1vneyt> Why not valk ult to to the building with the care package?
[2022-12-19 06:19:17] <%+zDevilsfood> it pulled to the water between the prowler pit and the island w/ the pills

[2022-12-19 08:52:48] <+just_benjigg> @DEATHKRUSH saves ammo, both guns burn a lot of ammo and if you use the same ammo type youll run out very quickly

[2022-12-19 08:55:53] <DEATHKRUSH> @just_benjigg everyone uses light ammo, way simpler to just loot one ammo type it‚Äôs kind of a nobrainer cause you‚Äôll still run out of ammo regardless

[2022-12-19 09:01:53] <+just_benjigg> @DEATHKRUSH its a preference kind of thing mostly, theres a very situational upside to running heavy + light. wheras running both light just kinda, makes it look cleaner?
