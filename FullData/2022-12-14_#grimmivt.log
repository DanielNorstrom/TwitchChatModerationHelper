[2022-12-14 04:58:55] <+VeryRarePlayer> older means more wise maybe, but def not smart
[2022-12-14 04:58:55] <!%Prof_PavloVT> They didn't even count all the laser energy.  They used like 500 megajoules to power the laser and only got like 2 megajoules into the plasma nugget.  They got out 2 megajoules in new energy, but when you account for the loss to the laser system they're still off by a factor of 100+ to break even.
[2022-12-14 04:58:57] <theresnoonehere21> The best part of being old is misinforming the young about events you allegedly lived through.

[2022-12-14 05:09:03] <%k_yama_> a brand collab with kanye west and addidas, brand was dissolved after he said insane anti-semtic stuff
[2022-12-14 05:09:05] <!%socialistOtter> he is surrounded by people who are deliberately making it worse
[2022-12-14 05:09:08] <%crownedpanda132> meds are good

[2022-12-14 05:09:45] <@%Extrafuzzy> Yea but his mental breakdown is not just his problem because he has a lot of money and influence
[2022-12-14 05:09:46] <+RemnantAdvent> awwww fuck not etika

[2022-12-14 05:10:00] <%ssdeluxe> Some have speculated that the masked Kanye is Kanye's evil twin trying to ruin his life.
[2022-12-14 05:10:02] <%Silentouch> imagine having a mental breakdown but having so much money you can buy and do whatever you want, and no one around you to say no in a way you will listen to
[2022-12-14 05:10:04] <!%socialistOtter> Kanye is unmedicated and surrounded by people who basically believe the same things and just use dogwhistles
[2022-12-14 05:10:05] <@%Extrafuzzy> Joycon Boyz forever

[2022-12-14 05:12:54] <%+Epicc11> I'm convinced most of what he says isn't even his own thoughts, He's just a hollow puppet for his handlers to screw around with and what he's says is just an extension of them.

[2022-12-14 05:25:22] <Phelben> so strange
[2022-12-14 05:25:24] <theresnoonehere21> From my experience  it's very easy to resist a cult leader if you are defensive, but almost impossible to resist if you are desperate and assume the leader wants to help. I can't blame anyone for falling for them and we shouldn't blame followers for falling for the scam. People don't realize that they never scam you right away, they build up trust, and then take everything one bit at a time.

[2022-12-14 06:32:28] <%RomeoEchoDelta> The Metal Gear 4 og ending probably didn't pan out because it's incredibly similar to the ending of a Gundam Novel from the 90's.

[2022-12-14 06:42:13] <itsjusthyde> i think starting with 3 is better because one has more frustrating moments and is less accessible. and three is very self contained so no harm
[2022-12-14 06:42:15] <%faychannel> it was also full of insanity
[2022-12-14 06:42:18] <%lord_badong> the gog version isn't very good tho

[2022-12-14 06:50:19] <SaiaiChan> So they can concentrate on the spooky things
[2022-12-14 06:50:21] <%Nullamm> no tank controls?

[2022-12-14 06:50:32] <%$snow_x_fall> they got to make it accessible to make back all that money they spend on development
[2022-12-14 06:50:51] <%King__Froggo> I think Blooper just needs guidance, and from what I've read Masahiro is gonna get more involved
[2022-12-14 06:50:58] <%King__Froggo> so I'm staying optimistic
[2022-12-14 06:50:59] <+VeryRarePlayer> it'd be funny if instead of a "hard mode", they just have tank controls
[2022-12-14 06:51:33] <%$snow_x_fall> anyone remember how Konami sent an unfinished version of The silent Hill trilogy to be remastered so they were basically setting them up for failure?
[2022-12-14 06:51:40] <Phelben> any control scheme is better than Up goes forward every other direction spins
[2022-12-14 06:51:41] <%RomeoEchoDelta> They need to keep combat semi-clunky.

[2022-12-14 06:53:14] <%King__Froggo> the battle network collection that's being released soon is almost certainly emulated

[2022-12-14 06:58:35] <%RomeoEchoDelta> @snow_x_fall Nah, VAs in Japan get treated like absolute ass regardless of standing.
[2022-12-14 06:58:55] <%RomeoEchoDelta> Same with animators
[2022-12-14 06:59:10] <SaiaiChan> VAs usually get treated well in Japan, but 'well' means... something different here
[2022-12-14 06:59:11] <%$snow_x_fall> @romeoechodelta I thought well-established and known voice actors get treated decently.
[2022-12-14 06:59:24] <%TiraMessiah> The more you know
[2022-12-14 06:59:35] <%RomeoEchoDelta> @snow_x_fall Define "decently"

[2022-12-14 07:00:10] <SaiaiChan> like they'll kill off characters or write them off instead of getting a new VA

[2022-12-14 07:04:41] <!%Prof_PavloVT> Hard to say if it would be better.  On one hand you would get more specific treatment, but you would also have the union representing far less people so have less negotiating power.

[2022-12-14 07:21:03] <TokiroAyakashi> @TokiroAyakashi yeah I think it was, maybe a distractable(their podcast)
[2022-12-14 07:21:08] <%ActionPts> I hope this is gameplay and not pretendered stuff
[2022-12-14 07:21:09] <TokiroAyakashi> Is it weird that I want to fried them and make them into chicharrones?
[2022-12-14 07:21:13] <thatstringfellow> since callisto isn't scratching the dead space itch I hope this will

[2022-12-14 07:22:23] <%RomeoEchoDelta> That looks waaay too much like a vertical slice or pre-rendered gameplay. I hope I'm wrong.
[2022-12-14 07:22:24] <!%socialistOtter> 'Moon's haunted' is a good concept

[2022-12-14 07:22:46] <%$eleni_afk> Something about outer space and horror mix so well..

[2022-12-14 07:22:54] <%+nachtigalfinn> I think the scariest game i have ever played is 5d Chess with Multidimensional Time Travel.
[2022-12-14 07:23:02] <%RomeoEchoDelta> Costello Protocol would be a very different game.
[2022-12-14 07:23:06] <+VeryRarePlayer> scariest concept for me is Soma, for sure
[2022-12-14 07:23:09] <Blizzinam> The guns scope being a low frame rate is so cool
[2022-12-14 07:23:09] <%$TravisBroski> @eleni_afk Probably cause you're in the middle of literal flippin nowhere and nobody is with you

[2022-12-14 07:24:12] <%+WoodedSeeker> It's a good short story
[2022-12-14 07:24:18] <Phelben> you were saying Castello
[2022-12-14 07:24:20] <%$TravisBroski> I remember the title very well, but isn't the whole game just "hey you're humanity, and you're fucked"
[2022-12-14 07:24:23] <%MoonStorm3d> Did you finish you ramin
[2022-12-14 07:24:24] <Lukas_Ipsum> the castanets protocol

[2022-12-14 07:25:14] <Fridge_Draws> the bad ending is the story's ending
[2022-12-14 07:25:15] <!%voltchuckleflumpkinsbunny> I understand that Grimmi would be terrified of having no mouth
[2022-12-14 07:25:17] <IDoSomeShitposting> The game was neat but also not enjoyable to play. It's a shame.

[2022-12-14 07:26:31] <%$TravisBroski> Honestly I can't think of many somehow and I didn't play a lot of horror games but I think the scariest game I've ever played, no joke, was Call of Duty World at War. Just cause the whole feeling is eerie.

[2022-12-14 07:26:40] <Lukas_Ipsum> @blizzinam one of the dreams, but nothing to do with the hanged man

[2022-12-14 07:26:44] <+VeryRarePlayer> that game is an enormous mindfuck and I will never emotionally recover
[2022-12-14 07:26:48] <%+WoodedSeeker> Scorn had me loss hope
[2022-12-14 07:26:49] <SaiaiChan> Kinda.

[2022-12-14 07:27:43] <%MoonStorm3d> ever play the newer PRAY
[2022-12-14 07:27:45] <%solidoutlaw> it's a really cool philosophical question, one that's horrifying to me, but my boss is totally cool with the idea of it if it happened to him
[2022-12-14 07:27:46] <%Nullamm> it's only scary if you think, so Never think

[2022-12-14 07:28:02] <%MisterXim> Non-consensual immortality
[2022-12-14 07:28:11] <thatstringfellow> Signalis is really good
[2022-12-14 07:28:19] <%+SiggyZav> the whole is it really if teleportation happens or do you die and a clone takes your place thing is awful
[2022-12-14 07:28:22] <%$eleni_afk> Have you made it to the trench in Soma?..
[2022-12-14 07:28:23] <%Tempest_52> I watched Leon play Signalis and I still don't understand it
[2022-12-14 07:28:26] <%RomeoEchoDelta> Signalis is way more wild than I ever thought it would be.
[2022-12-14 07:28:27] <marti_party_> Signalis is great
[2022-12-14 07:28:27] <%+nachtigalfinn> Bobiverse book series explores the engram copying pretty well
[2022-12-14 07:28:28] <!%socialistOtter> gonna make Grimmi immortal

[2022-12-14 07:28:34] <%solidoutlaw> Caps incoming but SIGNALIS IS SO GOOD IT'S GOTY I CANNOT STOP THINKING ABOUT IT I LOVE IT SO MUCH IT'S THE GREATEST THING I'VE PLAYED ALL YEAR AND I'VE PLAYED A LOT OF GAMES THIS YEAR
[2022-12-14 07:28:37] <%k_yama_> kana called signalis her game of the year
[2022-12-14 07:28:43] <%ughdontmakemeregister> have you ever looked at iron lung? its a short game
[2022-12-14 07:28:46] <Cozy_Nero> zamn
[2022-12-14 07:28:46] <Pond_water> Signalis is very good.
[2022-12-14 07:28:47] <@%GrevlenNOX> is good, long time I haven't played a game like that
[2022-12-14 07:28:50] <marti_party_> Like space Resident Evil with robo babes
[2022-12-14 07:28:51] <Blizzinam> @solidoutlaw You're loud but you're correct.
[2022-12-14 07:28:59] <%$TravisBroski> I usually like horror that's based in real circumstances, nothing like a giant fleshy monster with sharp teeth around its arm or something. Like fucked, horrifying things that can/actually happened.
[2022-12-14 07:29:03] <@%Extrafuzzy> not only that, you got boba cucked
[2022-12-14 07:29:05] <%Nullamm> she won't be
[2022-12-14 07:29:06] <!%voltchuckleflumpkinsbunny> Grimmi doesn't know how to show love PoroSad
[2022-12-14 07:29:07] <SaiaiChan> That's not quite the whole thing but that's what you're supposed to think it's about so you get a B for your answer
[2022-12-14 07:29:07] <thatstringfellow> Signalis has a lot of nods to silent hill and resident evil
[2022-12-14 07:29:11] <%Tempest_52> I somehow got the """Good""" end first try
[2022-12-14 07:29:11] <%ErraticPillow> needy streamer is needy
[2022-12-14 07:29:12] <%+SiggyZav> @ughdontmakemeregister iron lung is so good
[2022-12-14 07:29:17] <%solidoutlaw> I seldom stream, but I'm genuinely considering doing signalis runs because there's so much cool stuff to show off and talk about
[2022-12-14 07:29:19] <%RomeoEchoDelta> We need an Iron Lung counter.
[2022-12-14 07:29:28] <%code_phoenix410> you have a lot of games to play soon grimmi

[2022-12-14 07:30:41] <Fridge_Draws> fear and hunger 2 came out recently but you probably can't play that on twitch lol
[2022-12-14 07:30:42] <SaiaiChan> No no not like THAT
[2022-12-14 07:30:44] <Lukas_Ipsum> like how all those mortal kombat devs needed severe therapy after making xray moves?
[2022-12-14 07:30:55] <%$TravisBroski> Honestly as much as I don't like the developer, the deep web is a fascinating and horrifying concept for a game.
[2022-12-14 07:30:57] <!%All_bonesJones> he researched the deep web pretty shallowly but the content he found is all based on real stuff
[2022-12-14 07:31:00] <!%$Nyanomancer> yooooo, we hacking?
[2022-12-14 07:31:07] <%MoonStorm3d> only if your done with you food
[2022-12-14 07:31:09] <Blizzinam> Oh you havent started it, I assumed you had finished it LUL
[2022-12-14 07:31:11] <!%voltchuckleflumpkinsbunny> I think the first one isn't as bad? (in term of the sites)
[2022-12-14 07:31:12] <SaiaiChan> I mean like that one game where someone dies and you get their phone and you have to dig through their phone to find out why they died and it gets Weird
[2022-12-14 07:31:17] <%RomeoEchoDelta> A lot of the stuff exists, unfortunately not on the deep web. Most of that crap is just kind of out in the open on Reddit and Tumblr.
[2022-12-14 07:31:20] <SaiaiChan> I can't remember the name at all.
[2022-12-14 07:31:22] <!%7192_ch> just because a game has a category doesn't necessarily mean it's safe so be careful about that
[2022-12-14 07:31:47] <Blizzinam> @SaiaiChan Simulacra! Its fun!

[2022-12-14 07:32:35] <Blizzinam> My only interaction with the deep web was buying drugs off the most boring web shop in existence hampwnSippies
[2022-12-14 07:32:37] <SaiaiChan> Simulacra is a game where you get the phone of someone who die
[2022-12-14 07:32:38] <%sokoshinbutsu> simulacra was so good
[2022-12-14 07:32:40] <Pond_water> The categories are all just taken from a third party database.
[2022-12-14 07:32:40] <%Harrowick> Simulacra is a "found phone" horror game where you uncover the mystery of a missing girl by interacting with her phone
[2022-12-14 07:32:43] <%RomeoEchoDelta> Sim You Lack Ra
[2022-12-14 07:32:49] <@%GrevlenNOX> Are not the users who create the categories?

[2022-12-14 07:32:59] <+VeryRarePlayer> it's twitch safe, right?
[2022-12-14 07:33:00] <SaiaiChan> I think it's fine?
[2022-12-14 07:33:03] <%gilberthrz27> Hi Grimmi
[2022-12-14 07:33:05] <%sokoshinbutsu> it is
[2022-12-14 07:33:09] <Blizzinam> I can recommend Simulacra, it should 100% be Twitch safe.
[2022-12-14 07:33:18] <%Harrowick> I think the first game is the best chocos9Comfy
[2022-12-14 07:33:29] <SaiaiChan> no, no, it just has similar vibes in that it's you experiencing Spookies via technology

[2022-12-14 07:46:09] <%ActionPts> Resident Evil games get more camp toward the end of the game and the campiness starts in earlier in RE5.

[2022-12-14 07:50:55] <%code_phoenix410> the Alone in the Dark I played was traveling to an island and getting inside a mansion
[2022-12-14 07:50:58] <JulioAsiain> PSX was such a good console
[2022-12-14 07:51:00] <Blizzinam> @KillerQ13 It was the first, but Resident Evil is really where the genre saw success on a huge scale.

[2022-12-14 07:55:44] <Pond_water> Let people make stuff in the same space. Like I said earlier, RE borrows heavily from Alone in the Dark, but I don't see sense in rejecting RE because of that.

[2022-12-14 08:06:53] <Blizzinam> It also comes with Mick Gordon music so there's that
[2022-12-14 08:06:58] <%code_phoenix410> this isnt horror

[2022-12-14 08:10:57] <%Tempest_52> That happened with Deadly Premonition, there was original going to be no combat but the publisher demanded it, which is why the zombie segments feel so tacked on

[2022-12-14 08:45:30] <superfreshness> well, not technically, the deepweb consists of anything i cannot access through my normal browser, like your twitch whispers or instagram dms or bank statements
[2022-12-14 08:45:43] <%NunyaBizniz> theyre not the same. the deep web is any site you can only reach on a browser like TOR, the dark web is specifically the fucked up sites
[2022-12-14 08:45:44] <superfreshness> but the dark web/dark net is sites access through special protocols like onion sites

[2022-12-14 10:57:52] <!%voltchuckleflumpkinsbunny> Technically the cops can be considered a jumpscare as well

[2022-12-14 10:58:32] <%Theo768> @Streamers_Psychosis to be fair the mass majority of dark web sites are just harmless but edgy
[2022-12-14 10:58:41] <%RomeoEchoDelta> The deep web is vastly over hyped. Like bad shit happens there, but that incredibly rare even on there. You're more likely to find relatively mundane criminal stuff like drug sellers(scams), bitcoin exchanges(scams), and unregistered fire arms.
[2022-12-14 10:58:46] <Streamers_Psychosis> its not a waste of time if its with you!

[2022-12-14 10:59:30] <%RomeoEchoDelta> That's not even a joke that's extremely common. Even on the biggest sites like Silk Road.
[2022-12-14 10:59:43] <%Corvollo> Depends on which "Dark Web" you're on. A lot of them are "Compromised" meaning a lot of sites are monitored by entities like the FBI, or owned by the FBI directly.

[2022-12-14 11:08:08] <grindcommander> Dark web redrooms literally can't exist because of the lack of an ability to stream over it. That being said, your more likely to find executions on Facebook or TikTok because it's easier to recruit people to things like cartel gangs on clearer social media. Plagued Moth covers that kind of content exclusively pretty much.

[2022-12-14 12:31:18] <%+BigBadWulf97> that speedrun just made me miss the paranoia and all the threats the game has

[2022-12-14 12:33:01] <%Tempest_52> So literally doing nothing is the same as this ending I guess, all this was for nothing
[2022-12-14 12:33:19] <!%7192_ch> how nice of him to offer us a sandwich
[2022-12-14 12:33:21] <%RomeoEchoDelta> Plus why would he let us go if we know a of this. Just because he took all our stuff doesn't mean we can't find the evidence again.
[2022-12-14 12:33:25] <@%GrevlenNOX> thanks for the stream
[2022-12-14 12:33:25] <%+BigBadWulf97> I think the game would have been better with a more spread out plot
[2022-12-14 12:33:37] <%code_phoenix410> Grimmi, this is your resident house spirit speaking, pls get some sleep soon or when you hit the 9 hour mark... Worried about your sanity lol

[2022-12-14 12:35:19] <%RomeoEchoDelta> @nullamm It's a lot easier to avoid people if you know you're being watched already. Both sides can adapt but letting you go Scott free gives you a massive advantage.

[2022-12-14 12:36:13] <%Nullamm> @RomeoEchoDelta but even if he knows, prying and getting evidence leaves some trail. it's how they found him the first time. either they never see him again (he's not getting evidence) or they do...

[2022-12-14 12:37:49] <!%7192_ch> after all that hacking he made you do he probably deserves a little stapler beating
