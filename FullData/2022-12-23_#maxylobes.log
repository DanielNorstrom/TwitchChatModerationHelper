[2022-12-23 08:17:15] <+ZawkoTV> individual level or IL is a term used in speedrunning
[2022-12-23 08:17:50] <%+YamaJuugo> it is very creepy
[2022-12-23 08:17:59] <BANDBBen> @ZawkoTV ah, so like a personal best on a single level?
[2022-12-23 08:18:05] <+ZawkoTV> it means instead of speedrunning an entire game you just speedrun one level from the game
[2022-12-23 08:18:06] <McSwarlton_> You can't look at that and tell me santa isnt smoking
[2022-12-23 08:18:10] <itszairesyear> its pretty funny actually 😭

[2022-12-23 09:15:51] <%+elidangerous> is the nun not fully dying somehow
[2022-12-23 09:15:52] <TheStrange> Like how?!
[2022-12-23 09:15:55] <Blutsense> i think the timer goes very fast the more ppl are escaping

[2022-12-23 09:16:59] <alyryk> this seems easier with the knife
[2022-12-23 09:17:16] <%+einhander00> it's dependent on their pathing and how close they are to an exit
[2022-12-23 09:17:20] <faithdanks> If u press z u can use your knife
[2022-12-23 09:17:22] <TheStrange> That’s the strat!
[2022-12-23 09:17:36] <alyryk> all these nuns are so tall
