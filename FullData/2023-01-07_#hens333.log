[2023-01-07 15:05:16] <stalemaccasfries> @onigoss personally i don’t think pop needs a buff. it’s good on gen kicky killers (knight, sadako, freddy etc) and u can really exaggerate the regression with an extra regression perk. it’s in a very healthy spot

[2023-01-07 16:28:24] <%BuccaneerStinkyButt> honey clobber is rat clobber v2 improved
[2023-01-07 16:28:24] <!%Laser_EU> sometimes its not possible to save but, oftentimes pub killers dont know how to camp so theres an opening
[2023-01-07 16:28:24] <%SarahlMS> if you just tunnel, no. If you tunnel someone that makes no sense, you are toxic. Exemple: there is this meg dead on hook, then someone flash saves, and now I am going to tunnel someone with no hooks just because he did something I don't like
[2023-01-07 16:28:56] <rathumanhybrid> laptop being a laptop
[2023-01-07 16:28:58] <%SarahlMS> it is stupid, but happens
[2023-01-07 16:29:03] <%BuccaneerStinkyButt> that sounds like something 200 hour public game nemesis would do

[2023-01-07 16:29:05] <+VT_Doggo> thats not toxic its just kinda petty
[2023-01-07 16:29:05] <%benhyland777> How is that toxic
[2023-01-07 16:29:07] <%+Fliperotchy> but with 3 monitors that's a lot of pixels just even on the desktop. my work laptop struggles with 2 27in monitors doing emails and web browsin lol
[2023-01-07 16:29:23] <@%Ana1661> @SarahlMS And then you're getting accused of being a bully squad YEP
[2023-01-07 16:29:36] <!%Laser_EU> so instead of going for the DoH meg u go for the fresh hook that flash saved, how is that toxic, thats like actively throwing the game and the flashlight savior probably wants to get chased anyways

[2023-01-07 16:38:26] <%+zebdrinkscoffee> hes extremely effective with tunneling because of the infection off hook
[2023-01-07 16:38:27] <+SkeletalElite> Its because survivors come off hook infected so they're just fucked if you chase htem eventually
[2023-01-07 16:38:27] <Spookychiptune> aint never had a game with a wraith where he isn't taking the time out of his day to inspect every single one of my pores
[2023-01-07 16:38:30] <Kernann> Both RE killers tunnel hard in my experience. It's like the pig effect where you know the person off hook has the slowdown coming soon
[2023-01-07 16:38:34] <papa_peachy> This is what’s happening though and it’s so bad. When you get hooked he stays there and repeatedly uses his extra men to run the area. They’ve also hit me on hook for no reason just to be an ass
[2023-01-07 16:38:37] <deep_in_my_sauce> You have to be good with wesker to get his natural slowdown 😂

[2023-01-07 16:58:39] <+noboolipls> Maybe it’s the context of the violence in this game, like it’s a grim horror game where innocent people are being murdered with no comic relief or anything? Idk

[2023-01-07 16:58:59] <+NameIsMerc> youtube has been lame for awhile, it just doesnt have good competitors so it does what it wants

[2023-01-07 17:07:01] <!%Laser_EU> u know whats impressive about this map @Hens333 , they can rework it making it substantially better - and its still horrible afterwards
[2023-01-07 17:07:19] <%+pribzz> they should add MORE bushes on the rework i think
[2023-01-07 17:07:29] <!%Laser_EU> tile density and size are still too much
[2023-01-07 17:07:51] <%+Ellamin> Map redesign is fine except for the gigantic dead zone behind main

[2023-01-07 17:17:33] <+Propret> @GunpowderPete It's very much in character for RE5 Wesker so it's very faithful. Pinhead's lines are a butchered lines from the first movie. So I feel the opposite way
[2023-01-07 17:17:36] <@%animeangel09> read the title
[2023-01-07 17:17:37] <Skipperrc> i think giving small buffs to the killer after having hooked everybody once and twice would maybe be a good idea to encourage hooking different people

[2023-01-07 17:19:37] <RagingMonkie_Official> thoughts on the anti healing build on wesker? (sloppy, unnerving pressence, coulrophobia)
[2023-01-07 17:19:38] <BulgeConnoisseur> They are all bad, but first one is ok @freshMancio
[2023-01-07 17:19:47] <Spookychiptune> the irl films are goofy. cgi/animated films are closest to the game series
[2023-01-07 17:19:53] <+Propret> @noboolipls I don't like their delivery and some awkward changes like the one with the "no tears" is throwing me off
[2023-01-07 17:19:59] <Skipperrc> @Skipperrc i mean this could go both ways, like getting debuffs if someones dead on 3 hooks. but i feel like this could be pretty abusable by surv
[2023-01-07 17:20:02] <Spookychiptune> welcome to raccoon city is bad but i like it lmao

[2023-01-07 17:20:42] <!%Laser_EU> @Skipperrc im sure buffing survs for losing someone is not healthy
[2023-01-07 17:20:58] <16murrayj> u say u dont need to tunnel but ur a srsly good killer
[2023-01-07 17:21:08] <megasecret1> what about pig?
[2023-01-07 17:21:10] <!%Laser_EU> most killers apart from nurse and blight already struggle with getting someone out of the game before its over
[2023-01-07 17:21:15] <+noboolipls> Wesker’s slowdown is a bit healthier I think
[2023-01-07 17:21:22] <nicane___> pig traps can be better but rely on RNG
[2023-01-07 17:21:33] <megasecret1> not anymore
[2023-01-07 17:21:36] <GunpowderPete> i stil have hope they remake Freddy into something more accurate to the original character
[2023-01-07 17:21:44] <TheKatSidhe> some of the trash loops on these maps always feel really wonky to me as Wesker
[2023-01-07 17:21:50] <Skipperrc> @Laser_EU yeah thats kinda true
[2023-01-07 17:21:54] <vybee__> wesker is probably what i would like nurse to be bcuz imo wesker is a healthier for the game nurse
[2023-01-07 17:21:55] <+PurfectMeow> The problem with Pig is you need to actually down someone first and if people pre-throw and are even semi decent at looping it's rough
[2023-01-07 17:22:00] <nicane___> @megasecret1 i still remove them first try sometimes
[2023-01-07 17:22:11] <MergosWetNurse> nah u can let people start with traps on their head & remove box auras
[2023-01-07 17:22:15] <MergosWetNurse> massive pig early slowdown
[2023-01-07 17:22:15] <RagingMonkie_Official> @nicane___ i keep getting pigs trap me then chase me all game so i can never get it off or escape :(
[2023-01-07 17:22:15] <OhItsNoctu> i wish you could bound a 2nd time after bound vaulting
[2023-01-07 17:22:18] <GunpowderPete> i mean lore wise Freddy is almost almighty in dream and in this game his power reduced to slowing down people a bit, this is pathetic
[2023-01-07 17:22:20] <OfficialHarrow> how the hell did that work
[2023-01-07 17:22:31] <fizzleGG> yo, what is this? PepeLaugh 👉 CATBERUNNING4SLOWDOWNS
[2023-01-07 17:22:36] <megasecret1> if you remove them first try that means other people have to search like 4 boxes
[2023-01-07 17:22:37] <!%Laser_EU> @MergosWetNurse just means ppl dont pop gens until everyone has their trap off
[2023-01-07 17:22:38] VIEWERS: 896
[2023-01-07 17:22:50] <+noboolipls> Also pig can run out of her traps vs wesker who wins a war of attrition from survivors running out of sprays
[2023-01-07 17:23:12] <%A2Zephyr> I like finishing 99'd gens when my team has 2+ traps on
[2023-01-07 17:23:13] <TheKatSidhe> It's one reason I love Sadako, she can pull such interesting mindgames around lower loops
[2023-01-07 17:23:32] <vybee__> object
[2023-01-07 17:23:33] <Yumivers> objekt?
[2023-01-07 17:23:34] <OhItsNoctu> @fizzleGG a cat washing 4 slowdown perks so they feel nice and fresh even if played every single game FeelsOkayMan
[2023-01-07 17:23:36] <MergosWetNurse> @Laser_EU you would be surprised how much this addon combo slows the game down in most cases ^^
[2023-01-07 17:23:42] <%1cappyc_> hes not obsession
[2023-01-07 17:23:42] <Skipperrc> no way people play objerct LUL
[2023-01-07 17:23:43] <Pandom__> Not Object, obsession is dead
[2023-01-07 17:23:52] <megasecret1> you have lethal
[2023-01-07 17:23:54] <+Xytun> object plus lethal
[2023-01-07 17:23:54] <+RallerZZ> Lethal extends it too
[2023-01-07 17:23:58] <+meronna> 3+lethal
[2023-01-07 17:24:01] <!%Laser_EU> @MergosWetNurse im not saying it cant, im just saying if you play against good survivors its nothing more than annoying - it doesnt make you win the game
[2023-01-07 17:24:03] <fizzleGG> @OhItsNoctu that emote is sooo goofy, i love it OMEGALUL
[2023-01-07 17:24:10] <OhItsNoctu> @fizzleGG it is lmao
[2023-01-07 17:24:13] <vybee__> maybe he has object + aura perk
[2023-01-07 17:24:20] <+Xytun> lethal extends any aura reading no matter where it comes from
[2023-01-07 17:24:28] <@%Ana1661> @Laser_EU What's your opinion on Nurse's reworked addons btw I wanted to ask?

[2023-01-07 17:24:47] <+Xytun> @vybee__ that wouldn't give him aura of leon for any longer, it only works the other way around
[2023-01-07 17:24:49] <fizzleGG> @OhItsNoctu but it do be like that fr LUL
[2023-01-07 17:24:50] <!%Laser_EU> @Ana1661 i dont like recharge getting removed because it will make nurse more boring for both sides

[2023-01-07 17:25:10] <!%Laser_EU> @Ana1661 the addon to full blink 2nd and the one that allows you to go back are insanely stupid and shouldnt exist
[2023-01-07 17:25:14] <Yumivers> how
[2023-01-07 17:25:15] <Pandom__> No there was no way it was Object, the obsession was long dead
[2023-01-07 17:25:30] <Pandom__> It was either Floods or some random thing from an archive that I've never heard of
[2023-01-07 17:25:32] <OhItsNoctu> huh?
[2023-01-07 17:25:34] <!%Laser_EU> @Ana1661 the lunge distance addon is much less effective than anticipated and i dont like how it makes nurse take less skill (less accurate blinks)
[2023-01-07 17:25:37] <Leukodystrophy> maybe dying on hook counts for a floods proc?
[2023-01-07 17:25:41] <%1cappyc_> maybe there is a bug with wiretap=
[2023-01-07 17:25:42] <nicane___> the ada perk? he could see u so u aswell?
[2023-01-07 17:25:45] <$dbdpotato87> floods from unhook
[2023-01-07 17:25:49] <!%Laser_EU> @Ana1661 the range addons removed is really good
[2023-01-07 17:25:53] <akkarin412> It was floods the other guy 4%?
[2023-01-07 17:25:58] <+Xytun> you saw him cuz jeff got the self unhook on floods
[2023-01-07 17:26:06] <MandyTalk> What happened?
[2023-01-07 17:26:07] <akkarin412> No I’m wrong cause u hadn’t hooked yet
[2023-01-07 17:26:07] <%BuccaneerStinkyButt> you dont get floods on kobes do you?
[2023-01-07 17:26:08] <itsao69vbucks> No the jeff unhooked himself on a scourge hook thats why
[2023-01-07 17:26:08] <minhquynguyenmi> flood from unhook, the jeff kobe'd
[2023-01-07 17:26:15] <!%Laser_EU> @Ana1661 i hate the buff on the 4.4 walking addon because against nurse gets really really easy to play with that
[2023-01-07 17:26:18] <+Xytun> @akkarin412 yeah he had jeff hooked and he kobe'd
[2023-01-07 17:26:19] <%+dponly15> Instant replay, let’s see it!
[2023-01-07 17:26:20] <Leukodystrophy> oh he kobe'd on floods

[2023-01-07 17:26:23] <Leukodystrophy> makes sense
[2023-01-07 17:26:24] <%1cappyc_> floods work on kobes?
[2023-01-07 17:26:26] <OfficialHarrow> @akkarin412 he saw the leon while he was carrying the jeff

[2023-01-07 17:26:40] <+Xytun> @1cappyc_ kobe is still an unhook, just a self unhook
[2023-01-07 17:26:46] <+SneakyAlbaHD> Floods just specified when unhooked right? It should have triggered surely
[2023-01-07 17:26:50] <%+Commander_Ray> self unhooks don't apply any unhook perk, and Jeff was being carried
[2023-01-07 17:27:12] <!%Laser_EU> @MergosWetNurse thats kind of true yeah, but if youre good some killers allow you to do more than others

[2023-01-07 17:36:18] <el_the_shaman> @Slizza18 if they do its not their choice, bubba ip owners making a texas chainsaw game like dbd so they probably chose to remove him so it didn't hurt their sales
[2023-01-07 17:36:25] <akkarin412> @slizza18 they don’t want to. The theory is that a new game using the bubba license is coming out and dbd may not be able to keep using him

[2023-01-07 17:49:19] <TheKatSidhe> I mean, for a high-end video editing box 15 years ago you'd spend 2-3k easily, so spending that now for a gaming/streaming/editing platform seems quite reasonable to me

[2023-01-07 18:21:35] <nice_feed> not really
[2023-01-07 18:21:36] <ItsIts> @fizzleGG I think it's way too map dependent. Too closed and you can barely chainsaw, too open and they see you coming anyways
[2023-01-07 18:21:37] <plumy_starp> hello!
[2023-01-07 18:21:40] <neopolydora> gift of pain is not as good as pain res, but its not trash i guess

[2023-01-07 18:22:12] <+lumiinoous> she just wanted to show you her epic 99d sprint burst
[2023-01-07 18:22:12] <+MagicD3mon> gift of pain is underrated imo, especially with plaything
[2023-01-07 18:22:18] <FlameGuard76> love watching hens play billy. rarely get to see him played anymore
[2023-01-07 18:22:18] <%fizzleGG> @ItsIts yeah, that's exactly how I feel about this hmmgie
[2023-01-07 18:22:31] <%ClockworkPierrot> also requires you to be able to down everyone which isn't always easy if you're not as good yk :(

[2023-01-07 18:25:55] <neopolydora> if youre gonna run gift of pain, just run pain res and if youre gonna run both why not use agi to reduce luck and rng, not saying this is a bad build but youre using 3 perks and you could still get unlucky
