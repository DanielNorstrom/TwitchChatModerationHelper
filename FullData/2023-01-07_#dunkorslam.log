[2023-01-07 06:31:41] <@^Nightbot> CITBs: The science of understanding, deconstructing, and reconstructing Bet Runs. However, Chase is not a master of video games. It is impossible for him to hold his desire to throw. If one wishes to obtain a CITB, one must vote correctly 7 times in a row. This is the law of Chase In The Banks‚Ñ¢; the trophies of the Moist Mob. In accordance to this law, there is a taboo for Chase. During bets, looking at chat is strictly forbidden. For what could equal his wrath at everyone voting !no on TI Runs

[2023-01-07 07:11:32] <%i_wraith_x> @OverStimulated9000 If you get a 7 streak when betting yes or no on Dunk's adventures, you get  CITB and cash one in to return it to the shop.  But, he'll only put in a few so you may want to get two CITB's in case you don't buy it fast enough and you can forcebuy the item.

[2023-01-07 08:19:26] <%$Wckdneer> @DunkOrSlam you could always make the rule so that its like if there's less than 3 shifts left then it's okay to just call it done. BUT if you have like 4/5/6 shifts left and just ignore it because it got shifted away that feels kinda Sadge

[2023-01-07 08:21:42] <%WaxNumen> @Wckdneer The thing is, running through PWs isn't really a challenge, it's just tedium
[2023-01-07 08:21:43] <%+teh60> @KeviRun have u already played daily or do u have a glue searchin tool like the 62 wand search tool
[2023-01-07 08:21:45] <%+dusty_sprinkles> Ideally the shifts are meant to be experienced before you're OP/pre vault, but usually it takes you till then at least to find glue, adding time to the beginning wouldn't really hurt much
[2023-01-07 08:21:49] <%$Wckdneer> @DunkOrSlam all you'd need is some better or more consistent way of getting green fungus
[2023-01-07 08:21:53] <%vulporium> we need more noita drugs
[2023-01-07 08:22:27] <%$Wckdneer> @WaxNumen well yeha but the shifts themselves are challenge, so that's why if its like 3 shifts left, the time invested is not worth it, but more than that it would be.

[2023-01-07 08:36:25] <%Rychron> Here's the thing. You said a "jackdaw is a crow." Is it in the same family? Yes. No one's arguing that. As someone who is a scientist who studies crows, I am telling you, specifically, in science, no one calls jackdaws crows. If you want to be "specific" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing. If you're saying "crow family" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of Corvidae, which includes things from nutcrackers to blue jays to ravens.

[2023-01-07 10:07:37] <%Naicii> You are interpreting the rule differently to us

[2023-01-07 10:08:38] <%Naicii> @Lordwootman since he is actually shifting and not just stalling on each one
[2023-01-07 10:08:43] <%$Wckdneer> he just needs to find a better wand but dunk doesn't like challenges

[2023-01-07 10:10:06] <ArthurAshford> @DunkOrSlam The substitute rule is: If there is no fungal, you can go to glue or to extra orbs. You got glue.

[2023-01-07 10:44:39] <ArthurAshford> @Blaumagier i see, good to know, i'll keep it in mind, gotta sort some personal stuff but I'd be down to gm again
[2023-01-07 10:44:40] <%$Walnut60> Sorry if I'm a sad man but I only got into Noita probably 5, maybe 6 months ago. From that sorta outside perspective I guess, I see it as the Noita devs are done and it's a "dead" game. What the game is now is what it is forever. The current rules to the game are all it's ever gonna be. I wish it could be more but it is what it is in my mind :/ Maybe I'm pessimistic but here I am :/ @DunkOrSlam

[2023-01-07 11:22:26] <bgijy1> Early in the run Miczu made a good suggestion. Chat liked this.  Dunk then promptly misunderstood the rule in order to benefit himself, and so applied it.  Chat then rightfully rioted to protect the rules system we hold dear.  Dunk then had no option but to comply.
[2023-01-07 11:22:29] <%Sunforest> How about this rule: If fungal is shifted away, the run is lost :)

[2023-01-07 11:27:39] <bgijy1> The idea with grabbing orbs instead of shifting is so that you don't have to go ridiculously out of your way to find glue (can sometimes take multiple parallel worlds).  But the most extra orbs could be is 1 parallel world.  So you could grab extra orbs, but if you see glue, you use that instead.  If you have already grabbed orbs, we wouldn't be upset, so long as any remaining shifts are done.

[2023-01-07 11:36:19] <%+Dalvarious> The hoodie is a Noita good luck charm. If Dunk washes it, he will lose his Noita luck. If he loses his Noita luck, doubters will win. So Dunk will never wash his orange hoodie ever again.

[2023-01-07 13:28:23] <%ruslanbes> Acid was shifted maybe because of that
