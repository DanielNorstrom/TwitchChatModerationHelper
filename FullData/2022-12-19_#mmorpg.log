[2022-12-19 14:32:13] <Ryolm> there is, but if you already selected perma before hand its locked in
[2022-12-19 14:32:17] <fkaus> wouldnt the option to remove permanent iron sort of defeat the purpose of setting it as permanent

[2022-12-19 15:13:00] <%Adrenzy> can i charge the same 28 glories over and over for eternal?
[2022-12-19 15:13:06] <%Adrenzy> or do you need to deplete the charges
[2022-12-19 15:13:11] <@%SaekeaS> luckily not. i guess it depends on a product and whats the problem. they can decide if it cheaper to fix or even possible. and either give new one/money back or fix it.
[2022-12-19 15:13:34] <@%SaekeaS> so if it was fixable it could have taken some time but depending on time they can also give replacement for the time being
[2022-12-19 15:13:39] <%Adrenzy> and if i take 28 in one inventory is that 28 chances

[2022-12-19 16:29:44] <pzode> @misterpategoo it's more about the fact that you have to use a crush style to max on para/husks. seems like it doesn't matter about the slash def roll as long as you're on a crush style
[2022-12-19 16:29:48] <i_breakrules> @misterpategoo you're right it rolls off a predetermined style. PNM has a manual override though to check for crush being the selected style instead of the weapons spec override style. It didn't used to be that way and was fixed in a ninja update on an unknown date
[2022-12-19 16:30:07] <pzode> @i_breakrules ahhh that makes sense, cos I swear I tried it before and didn't max on it with spec
[2022-12-19 16:30:09] <i_breakrules> but claws should definitely be on slash
[2022-12-19 16:30:12] <misterpategoo> oh shit didnt knew

[2022-12-19 16:31:25] <i_breakrules> it is now, but spec weps whose specs aren't crushed used to not max even if you had crush selected
[2022-12-19 16:31:37] <i_breakrules> sgs specs are always slash in normal gameplay
[2022-12-19 16:31:48] <pzode> worth bringing LB/b-ring switch and only use LB when maging?

[2022-12-19 16:33:40] <pzode> ye I use one but ham joint is nicer as I have a max hit of 19 if I lose divine super combat
[2022-12-19 16:33:46] <pzode> with event
[2022-12-19 16:33:48] <i_breakrules> @pzode you mean goblin paint cannon. Event rpg doesn't exist anymore :)
[2022-12-19 16:33:50] <pzode> so ham joint + defender = higher max hit
[2022-12-19 16:33:53] <i_breakrules> why they renamed that item I have no idea
[2022-12-19 16:34:01] <pzode> lmao ikr
[2022-12-19 16:34:06] <pzode> I came back and it changed, weird
[2022-12-19 16:34:21] <i_breakrules> higher max hit doesn't matter if you oneshot husks anyway so it's whatever imo

[2022-12-19 17:00:31] <TailMan> thrall you summon from one of the spellbooks
[2022-12-19 17:00:41] <%NeoPara_> Yeah it's basically an updated version of the zaryte bow they planned for nex isn't it, before they changed to the ZCB after the beta
[2022-12-19 17:00:42] <%+07_mmk> that ghost is called timmy he helps with tiggling nightmare for curtis

[2022-12-19 17:01:09] <pcrooce> huh.. is just for this boss fight or you can summon it whenever? :)
[2022-12-19 17:01:12] <%Corvollo> @pcrooce Thralls that deal 0-3 damage every few seconds. It's part of the Arceeus spellbook that deals with necromancy, demons, basically an occult spellbook

[2022-12-19 17:03:08] <%Corvollo> @pcrooce It is, but it adds up overtime and the thrall works totally passive, you summon it once and let it do it's thing. It's particularly useful when that attack causes the boss to act a certain way.
