[2023-01-10 22:43:11] <%Antoinesko> why
[2023-01-10 22:43:19] <elgranmindungi> Full astalor family
[2023-01-10 22:43:21] <@%tictac_hs> But Astalor isn't problematic in non-rogue/warrior decks
[2023-01-10 22:43:22] <AlogisioS> why not get the armor missplay
[2023-01-10 22:43:25] <@%tictac_hs> I mean uh druid, not warrior

[2023-01-10 22:43:44] <g0thbaddie> imagine talking about warrior like a real deck fucking clown
[2023-01-10 22:43:53] <%gab557> @tictac_hs it does 16 damage how this isnt problematic
[2023-01-10 22:43:57] <+vmightyiy> @g0thbaddie ?
[2023-01-10 22:44:04] <elgranmindungi> Lol @stantehman you have 0 idea dude. Astalor is perfectly fine
[2023-01-10 22:44:11] <Quniverse> everyone wants everything deleted just stop playing
[2023-01-10 22:44:15] <elgranmindungi> It's just a good card, that's it
[2023-01-10 22:44:19] <@%tictac_hs> 16 damage isn't that much
[2023-01-10 22:44:21] <g0thbaddie> @vmightyiy ? yourself warrior is fake
[2023-01-10 22:44:22] <f3000xen> astalor being in every deck that can run more than 3 minions says something

[2023-01-10 22:44:38] <dibblekahn> @gab557 16dmg isn’t problematic but when you get 3 of them it’s more unfair
[2023-01-10 22:44:40] <@%tictac_hs> You can play around it by having a board
[2023-01-10 22:44:42] <Giggle_hs> @elgranmindungi laughed out loud at "astalor is fine".. coffee came out of my nose
[2023-01-10 22:44:56] <@%tictac_hs> 1 Astalor is fine, 3 astalors in one game isn't fine
[2023-01-10 22:45:02] <%+Alieksey> The damage doesn't matter tho. Its 3 cards in one. Plus a neutral. Card generation is really powerful.
[2023-01-10 22:45:11] <@%tictac_hs> Astalor is a legendary you shouldn't be able to play the card over and over
[2023-01-10 22:45:12] <AlogisioS> guys astalor is balanced end of story
[2023-01-10 22:45:13] <elgranmindungi> @stantehman right, I am such an idiot that there is a non-ironic message saying Astalor is broken

[2023-01-10 22:45:40] <Lvl_100_Magikarp> needing to run a card in every deck because you're at a huge disadvantage if you don't have it is the definition of overpowered

[2023-01-10 22:51:21] <Ernest_Khalimov_> i think people who are pro brexit were more likely to vote for it
[2023-01-10 22:51:25] <%+damon791> I also voted brexit
[2023-01-10 22:51:25] <elgranmindungi> I am not surprised at all. I voted Brexit and I don't regret it
[2023-01-10 22:51:47] <Zuranthium> yeah they need to be cleansed.
[2023-01-10 22:51:58] <+paicho85> the german press said "british ppl still got a feeling for the old british empire, kinda want it back"
[2023-01-10 22:51:59] <bongoman__> so half of the British population has major problems
[2023-01-10 22:52:02] <%funkyjakey> Once all the old people die, in like 30 years the UK will rejoin EU. at that point it will be lesson learnt
[2023-01-10 22:52:08] <Poskro_> OMG WHAT A BULLSHIT
[2023-01-10 22:52:11] <hylianhero85> My unpopular opinion? Humans in general suck. Imo, a meteor hitting this planet would do us all a favor, and hopefully the restart is better.

[2023-01-10 22:53:37] <elgranmindungi> Oh. So now that people voted for something I don't like, I say "people are too dumb to decide". When the results are the ones that I like, I call it Democracy
[2023-01-10 22:53:43] <%funkyjakey> it was Boris saying they would get 300 mullion a week extra by leaving the EU which can be then pumped into the NHS. which wasn't entirely true and the old people fell for the trap. Well played Boris GG....

[2023-01-10 23:16:18] <nalbor1989> I know that one. After you make a tattoo you have to wait for 6months and you can donate @MeatiHS
[2023-01-10 23:16:20] <fishy1203> if i don't move for 5 years straight will I get a heart attack

[2023-01-10 23:16:32] <jm4ax> I think it needs sometthing like 3-6 months to pass after u got tattooed

[2023-01-10 23:22:07] <!%+shanevapid> When you start doing heavy weight, just play it safe and get a spotter. A spotter can let you get into position and just put the dumbbells in your hands. Otherwise just do lower weight + more reps @imbot0x
