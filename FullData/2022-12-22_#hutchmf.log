[2022-12-22 18:33:35] <+Heatst0rm> With 4.0 will the legislation be like it is now or is there a reset in that too?
[2022-12-22 18:33:49] <%+TRiiXdt> Cops just need to be held more accountable for doing something wrong thats all. fines or somethinf would help i think. Make them be bike patrol if they screw up to much or traffic control
[2022-12-22 18:33:57] <%+DJSquashy> @Johnjoy121  dont think so
[2022-12-22 18:34:01] <clownpiecettv> I don't know where the gold door is but it has infinite loot /coin pile you can interact with to fill your inventory up.
[2022-12-22 18:34:15] <+Xairuz> I think they should've just made the Mask mandate a server rule. if they don't like ppl wearing mask all the time. Making it a crime/violation is too gray in rp.

[2022-12-22 18:46:29] <DrugsAreForAdults> i think the storage size, and having coins take up slots is good for the game cause it forces people to use their shit
[2022-12-22 18:46:32] <%+Themaddhatter19> whats silver coins for?
[2022-12-22 18:46:58] <%$b4none> they should make a similar mechanic to tarkov cases

[2022-12-22 19:09:26] <Aerah99> u can ignite or invis other people
[2022-12-22 19:09:34] <MegaTheChef> their spells will kill all including teammates easily in small hallways and rooms
[2022-12-22 19:09:36] <+Hurpud> @tonyalmeida rogue for loot and scoot, u might win 1v1 but ranger best by far
[2022-12-22 19:10:04] <biscuitxl> the spiders are so damn annoying. took me 4-5 runs before i realized you could kill what they spawn out of lmao

[2022-12-22 19:11:38] <+Lustruh> A wizard thats not rammee*
[2022-12-22 19:11:45] <MegaTheChef> they have to stand in place to cast these ttoo if its a cast bar like magic missiles
[2022-12-22 19:11:48] <+Hurpud> zap is viable but better off just having a ranger at that point
[2022-12-22 19:11:49] <Aerah99> ill carry you with my Rizzard
[2022-12-22 19:11:51] <Baeltox> you just play wizzard as a support in pvp if in group

[2022-12-22 19:12:28] <%Molth0r> i think its 2 players
[2022-12-22 19:12:34] <+Ephex_> look up kenknobi's wizard play, hes definitely not backline fighting
[2022-12-22 19:12:49] <$MrCM> @CookeTheWook yes its 4.5m tho, and lasts 2 seconds..
[2022-12-22 19:12:51] <MegaTheChef> @MrCM u need to always come in with a iittle more armor than normal from merchants. will help with damage intake but your posittioning in those fights are important
[2022-12-22 19:13:06] <+Hurpud> @MrCM keep up shield and throw an attack if u get a bit of distance just to intimidate, buy time for ur fighter to help
[2022-12-22 19:13:18] <MegaTheChef> u gotta make sure ur fighter is the main target for the enemy @MrCM  so that means he needs to make sure they cant B line u

[2022-12-22 19:13:40] <MegaTheChef> but if ur really good at combatt u can play cleric like a paladin, put on shield and play a little front line but its risky

[2022-12-22 19:22:09] <DSkay> @toxickarma838 what class are u running? If u are dying to pve, maybe try fighter. If pvp is the problem, try rogue or ranger. No shame on avoiding combat and extract with a few items, it will help you get strated. And also, try avoiding big rooms. You got it bro

[2022-12-22 19:23:04] <MegaTheChef> @toxickarma838 i dont think the class has anything to do with it cause even higher leveled mobs like red skeles and red mummies have a attack animation that is so easy tto dodge. ive played wit people that unnecessarily take damage because they have bad movement
[2022-12-22 19:23:12] <biscuitxl> @toxickarma838 you can try ratting on the edge of the circle and avoiding teams while you wait for one to spawn

[2022-12-22 22:35:25] <+StageName> Normal places do it it for under a dollar to check
[2022-12-22 22:35:30] <PUREvilinc> The scammers don't tend to be very good with computers.
[2022-12-22 22:35:33] <%+pichoto> that is the same that Kitboga does
[2022-12-22 22:35:37] <bomb2chest> They already have the money
[2022-12-22 22:35:40] <%stuntrider750> they are just editing the page
[2022-12-22 22:35:42] <%+TRiiXdt> They do it by how much you have
[2022-12-22 22:35:42] <@^StreamElements> Check out HutchMF's YouTube at: https://youtube.com/c/HutchMF
[2022-12-22 22:35:45] <+redfoxlive24> They see your account first and choose an amount I would guess
[2022-12-22 22:35:47] <%+TRiiXdt> not always the same amount
[2022-12-22 22:35:48] <+00whysoserious00> they can only give you the amount in your account or more
[2022-12-22 22:35:49] <%Emywox> they probably use an amount that they can get and not 40k
[2022-12-22 22:35:49] <%Padge_> @HutchMF They only deposit a % that they know you have the money in already
[2022-12-22 22:35:50] <%+atreyq> They would go off of however much you have
[2022-12-22 22:35:51] <%GrimSkallTV> they edit the html page to show it
[2022-12-22 22:35:51] <%iCeReal> They said earlier you can only do loans on what you have
[2022-12-22 22:35:51] <+Nomandino> they will fake deposit the amount that you already have in your bank account @HutchMF
[2022-12-22 22:35:51] <dennimen50> they adding fake money transfer on your screen?
[2022-12-22 22:35:52] <Mr_Sk4z> just numbers in a sheet, @HutchMF
[2022-12-22 22:35:54] <+TweeetoR> they already have enough money in the account
[2022-12-22 22:35:54] <UnlockingJojohn> they make it seem like they gave you money then get you to send them all your money
[2022-12-22 22:35:54] <+bigruth> they make it look like you have 80,000 and give them 40,000
[2022-12-22 22:35:54] <%$StevenB79> add zero's to a 4 dollar deposit
[2022-12-22 22:35:55] <%+MindOfMonsters> they target people that already have the money
[2022-12-22 22:35:56] <%taraist_> find out in RP
[2022-12-22 22:35:57] <+Drunknpoodle> They verify funds
[2022-12-22 22:35:58] <%+pichoto> @HutchMF is the same that kitboga does, they enter in your PC and edit the HTML, to make you believe that they did the money
[2022-12-22 22:35:59] <%+fat_dabber> they only do as much as you have
[2022-12-22 22:36:00] <+Aw4k3ned> example
[2022-12-22 22:36:02] <extruitagonziche> they spoof a 40k account to look like 80k
[2022-12-22 22:36:02] <%justchillinjay> they see your balance when you log in and adjust the "deposit" amount accordingly @HutchMF
[2022-12-22 22:36:02] <+Nefariousdeath> Im assuming the next time its for less
[2022-12-22 22:36:03] <+TheSavageCoder> They do the $$ that you have in your account
[2022-12-22 22:36:04] <+catninjajar> they are editting numbers on a page to show 80k when you only have 40k
[2022-12-22 22:36:05] <+Benzinbird> it was just an example, so they set the value lower
[2022-12-22 22:36:05] <Aztroe22> love this guy
[2022-12-22 22:36:06] <+00whysoserious00> they don't actually send it
[2022-12-22 22:36:06] <Gezis> The money that you already have they take from you

[2022-12-22 22:36:16] <%+Suthernn> They don‚Äôt put anything in. They edit your HTML to fake it. Then you‚Äôre REALLY sending money back. It‚Äôs an ‚Äúoops we messed up‚Äù thing.
[2022-12-22 22:36:17] <%+TRiiXdt> you know but we love you
[2022-12-22 22:36:18] <%Padge_> @HutchMF Here comes the cards, box of money, and such
[2022-12-22 22:36:19] <%Sanjo__> That would only work if they transfered money from one account to the other. Not just html edit. You are not dumb they explained it incorrectly.
[2022-12-22 22:36:20] <%+JoshLineDesign> because they can edit the page @HutchMF so they send 1 dollar but change the screen to 10,000
[2022-12-22 22:36:23] <%+killakapper> you have 40k in your account they fake send 40 then you send "back" your 40k
[2022-12-22 22:36:26] <+catninjajar> Then they hold you hostage against the credit of holding 40k
[2022-12-22 22:36:33] <+StageName> you arent dumb. this shit gets fucking confusing
[2022-12-22 22:36:34] VIEWERS: 2¬†111
[2022-12-22 22:36:35] <+ST0NECUTTER_> they try and double your account balance & have you send back your original ballance
[2022-12-22 22:36:41] <+SA_WhiteWolf> they put in the same amount of money you have in your bank so say 10k in your account they edit it to 20k and ask for 10k back

[2022-12-22 23:54:49] <+SlimeBucket_> is there a mele kick ? ?
[2022-12-22 23:54:51] <+Etrius1> They have to make the other ranger skills better... right now there is zero point to have them
[2022-12-22 23:55:03] <+SlimeBucket_> they need to add something to push bodyblocks
