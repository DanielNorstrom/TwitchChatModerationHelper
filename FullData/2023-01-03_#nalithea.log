[2023-01-03 11:33:55] <@%Grimstab77> Also it's very good to pocket the genji when he goes on a flank like that

[2023-01-03 11:53:30] <@%Grimstab77> If you have Echo and pharah you can fly between both of them. Damage boosting pharah is the default one. If you want advanced tip. You can dmg boost Echo during her bomb and laser cooldowns and then go back to your pharah

[2023-01-03 12:06:27] <%night_wolfiez> i find that 3 stacking is the best

[2023-01-03 12:06:44] <@%Grimstab77> @xalienpoptartx well, overwatch is quite a complicated game
[2023-01-03 12:07:08] <xalienpoptartx> I don’t know, it was just a lot going on lmao and I’m not used to it
[2023-01-03 12:07:23] <%+TacticalAleX> Overwatch is very chaotic at times :')
[2023-01-03 12:07:25] <@%Grimstab77> dw it takes time to understand
[2023-01-03 12:07:36] <@%Grimstab77> there's a lot of chaos and a lot to know. Give it times
[2023-01-03 12:07:42] <panda_senpai12> @TacticalAleX but it can also be for some reason wholesome

[2023-01-03 12:08:44] <%+TacticalAleX> It can be wholesome yeah, ive met some of the nicest people on overwatch
[2023-01-03 12:09:04] <xalienpoptartx> I literally played OW1 didn’t even last a whole match lmaoooooo now I’m trying ow2,,, I like it but I think it would b better w someone to play with. People barely talk in my matches
[2023-01-03 12:09:04] <panda_senpai12> i also met some of the worst people LUL
[2023-01-03 12:09:23] <@%Grimstab77> Haha, overwatch tends to draw to worst side of ppl due to frustration ^^
[2023-01-03 12:09:28] <panda_senpai12> being hardstuck brings the worst in people
[2023-01-03 12:09:47] <%+TacticalAleX> Very true, ive met very toxic people on ow aswell

[2023-01-03 15:06:38] <+emiliogonzo412> Moira is practically a dps but also somehow a really good support at the Same time
[2023-01-03 15:07:06] <%night_wolfiez> ahh right... i think she would sound pretty cute singing haha
[2023-01-03 15:07:18] <alcode_goes_honk> mmoira is my main, she is incredible and gives me gender envy <3
[2023-01-03 15:07:38] <@%Grimstab77> @night_wolfiez she would but I think she's not comfortable with that.

[2023-01-03 15:11:05] <@%Grimstab77> @Nalithea echo is pretty simple. You spam bombs and left click until someone is half HP and then you fly in and use your beam. Your beam deals +200% dmg on half hp targets

[2023-01-03 17:00:19] <firemaster32> maybe is the skin
[2023-01-03 17:00:22] <+Complexitiesss> it didnt look laggy, i know when he throws them they kinda stagger

[2023-01-03 17:00:34] <@%Grimstab77> It's not only this skin but it lags more with this skin
[2023-01-03 17:00:50] <%+MALYG0S> Use the alternative fire more
[2023-01-03 17:00:53] <@%Grimstab77> You're still top dmg in your team xD

[2023-01-03 17:02:01] <@%Grimstab77> I think you should master other dps hero before genji

[2023-01-03 17:02:41] <@%Grimstab77> Yes, genji require a lot of knowledge about DPS positioning and interactions
[2023-01-03 17:02:57] <%+MALYG0S> Don't forget to dash a lot of your burst dmg comes from that

[2023-01-03 20:22:21] <raghav504> I have seen 3 types of aim bot . 1st even you shot opposite to the enemies you still get the no matter if there is a wall too . 2nd a bot which snaps on the head.  3rd will turn to the players and stay there not on the head but random
[2023-01-03 20:22:21] <+0nyxPanther> It's your money, do what makes you happy
[2023-01-03 20:22:21] <JGHorror> Oh lol you should get a mini keyboard for all that
