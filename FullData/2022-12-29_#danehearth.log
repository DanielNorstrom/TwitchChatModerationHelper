[2022-12-29 18:54:09] <@^Nightbot> Hi, I've just played a game of Big Priest and on turn 5 instead of conceding my opponent killed my hero ??? And then the screen showed "defeat" and i didn't even win a star ????? I'm so confused about what happened, so I was wondering if there was any way I could report this bug to Blizzard. For context this happened on the European server at about 5.50 pm. I'm currently Diamond 4 but I'm scared to play now. I don't know if it could be linked but it was 13¬∞C/55¬∞F

Practically costs nothing at all, you drop it on the board and that chill ass motherfucker gives you some memes to use later in the game. And you also get this adorable little dude that can ping things but usually is too harmless to be removed.

[2022-12-29 20:21:48] <+TooTsaka> Blasters are not something I recommend for new players. Has the issue that if people get in your face, chances are you ain't hitting them because the blast goes past them. So you have to directly hit them.
