[2023-01-02 11:31:01] <Knight_Zao> the north wasnt balanced on swamped... apparently the north won 70%of games.. i think it was because of the climb... and the players who knew would win lots of games

[2023-01-02 13:04:59] <%Gekousi> @skill4ltu because War Thunder begun with fighter planes
[2023-01-02 13:04:59] <SkrzypolDT> I think WoT is more arcade type and better to watch

[2023-01-02 13:05:13] <%Gekousi> @skill4ltu and then they added the tanks

[2023-01-02 13:07:30] <%Saiknot> @skill4ltu WT is slow paced. Also its like 3 games in one. You can play planes, tanks, ships or play all  above together. WOT is just tank. Tank community at WOT is bigger than WT

[2023-01-02 13:27:23] <trikolkata> @drevo3 obviously you need more games. You need an average of 1017 dmg over 100 GAMES to get the first mark. if you have more damage than that you will get it sooner than 100 games

[2023-01-02 14:27:14] <%+peter6345> @skill4ltu  the marathon that was a pain in the butt was the one for  T34 B, IS6 B and the Mutz. I did mine as well as both my roommates because they had to work.

[2023-01-02 14:28:03] <xouricoh> @skill4ltu hello king baboon. Is this new account provided by WG with all tanks for you to mark or you bought all these tanks?

[2023-01-02 14:28:05] <%Elite071> TS-5 was lovely
[2023-01-02 14:28:07] <%andrei007_2> @AAKettu Thanks for the gift sub!
[2023-01-02 14:28:08] <%CiKiS> uwu
[2023-01-02 14:28:18] <nindzsucu> which marathon was the last?
[2023-01-02 14:28:21] <%+leicester_square> Do you guys also have the problem receiving the Prime Gaming Loot?  Sometimes i do get it after several days...
[2023-01-02 14:28:25] <Eifprinter> they should make more ts5 marathons
[2023-01-02 14:28:25] <smurfekiller> and it all started when FV4202 was removed from tier X
[2023-01-02 14:28:45] <%+dezuaaa> any new maraton incoming?
[2023-01-02 14:28:48] <Ap3L1nc0ln> i once did the marathon for Pilot with tier6 tanks only
[2023-01-02 14:28:51] <%+peter6345> @skill4ltu getting E25 was pretty easy also
[2023-01-02 14:28:54] <%punish3r_192> @AAKettu Thanks for the gift sub!
[2023-01-02 14:28:58] <oncedead_butsavedby_rng> @skill4ltu  I remember when it was rumored the FV4202 will be replaced by the Centurion so I started grinding the line from the Cromwell. I literally finished 1 day before the updtae when they introduced the Centurion Action shit
[2023-01-02 14:28:58] <Bozydar420> shptk marathon was quite easy compared to the old ones
[2023-01-02 14:28:59] <kokamate> Agree. And also for WZ-111 (it was long time ago but it was eazy)
[2023-01-02 14:29:00] <Ap3L1nc0ln> pure pain
[2023-01-02 14:29:03] <@%Nyxphobia> @nindzsucu I think SHPTK was the last one
[2023-01-02 14:29:11] <narkomanic> @skill what happens if i put improved equipment in rental tanks afrter rental battles have been played
[2023-01-02 14:29:22] <churik_ua> @themaroko1337  not for Russian players, but for players who played in the Russian region
[2023-01-02 14:29:25] <benthen_> Do you think this tank might appear in some auction in future?
[2023-01-02 14:29:33] <wolfscout1950> thats how the tank is

[2023-01-02 14:30:58] <oncedead_butsavedby_rng> @skill4ltu  TBH FV was an okish T10 med, the only bad thing was it's top speed. If I remember right it had 35 as a T10 medium. It was nuts

[2023-01-02 14:32:36] <oncedead_butsavedby_rng> @narkomanic I guess you still need to pay the bonds to demount them, or you can sell them with the tank

[2023-01-02 14:35:14] <@%Nyxphobia> @v1ks1x From heavies, Patriot and KV4 Kreslavsky are the best in my opinion. T-34-3 is good but you get ammo racked or set on fire a lot of times

[2023-01-02 19:25:16] <@%ItzAndreyZhak> @2old4badgames Depends on many factors. If you're in close range, i'd say yes, but if you aim to pen tanks at a high distance, APCR will lose a quite the amount of penetration and might not be that effective.

[2023-01-02 22:39:55] <be1eth> what is your opinion why WG don't encourage tanking? for example in Mark of Ex.? @skill4ltu
[2023-01-02 22:39:55] <staraves1> HT with low alpha dmg guns are not fun

[2023-01-02 22:41:02] <just_likethat> @skill4ltu sometimes being stuck in one place is not so bad, specialy if place is nice warm and wet HypeEvil
[2023-01-02 22:41:16] <antonis360r> best way is use gold ammo to track then attack from side and back

[2023-01-02 22:42:07] <%+psynonamous> Thanks for the drops today Skiiiiillllllll, hoping this year will be better for everyone
[2023-01-02 22:42:07] <%+keysersozeh_souljah> I totally agree @staraves1 , a heavy with low alpha is so discouraging. You do all the work to get to a dominant posions blocking shots taking a hit or two and hit like a powder puff is quite stressful.

[2023-01-02 22:55:50] <@%Nyxphobia> @doyoulikeme36 That tank can meet only +1 tier higher
[2023-01-02 22:55:56] <iamheatnow> @skill4ltu  maybe if WG put rocked and 400 alpha derp with same reload would be fine Kappa
[2023-01-02 22:56:01] <%masters999> me first!!!!
[2023-01-02 22:56:02] <doyoulikeme36> oh okay thankyou guys
[2023-01-02 22:56:03] <Johansson_88> isnt it actually illegal to ninja nerf prems?
[2023-01-02 22:56:09] <@%+evofrogmr> @Reavus1 can still see -2
[2023-01-02 22:56:11] <@%momix99> @Reavus1 +1 / -2 actually :D
[2023-01-02 22:56:16] <%CpillinF2P> which tanks have +1 matchmaking?
[2023-01-02 22:56:18] <+CheezeEater> players cant see hidden stat nerf, like they did with premium t8 skorpion
[2023-01-02 22:56:38] <oldgroq> 184 dmg... jeez, this is awful for a HT
[2023-01-02 22:56:40] <@%Nyxphobia> @CpillinF2P Older tanks like super pershing, is-6, kv-5 etc
[2023-01-02 22:56:46] <%$paranoid_custodian> @skill4ltu nah the game and everything in it belongs to them.  They can do what they want
[2023-01-02 22:56:47] <@%momix99> @CpillinF2P in tier 8 for example Super Pershing, Type 59, T-34-3, M6A2E1, KV-5, IS-6
[2023-01-02 22:56:49] <sun3p604> but how to prove it xd

[2023-01-02 22:57:00] <HaroMangala> @skill4ltu not sure about silent nerf/buff but MM is number one bulshit ...11 years i am playing this game but mm is getting worse ...
[2023-01-02 22:57:03] <%uploader51> they might get sued for anything, but they'd win , they did nerf premiums in past no problems

[2023-01-02 22:57:49] <iamheatnow> @skill4ltu  u forgot to say it has good gun depression Kappa
[2023-01-02 22:57:59] <@%momix99> 112 and WZ-111 have it tho @CpillinF2P
[2023-01-02 22:58:00] <jaciekrynca> @skill4ltu in bp tank is t32M
[2023-01-02 22:58:00] <%meinke012> I think the only problem of BZ is the alfa dmg. If they change pen, ou the HE dynamics, or waht else. The problem should be fixed
[2023-01-02 22:58:03] <%+kriskaem> they will ballance ALL with gun overheating mechanism
[2023-01-02 22:58:04] <rotinvrede> i know so. yes

[2023-01-02 22:58:19] <%+Azwing> if they could they would have already done so
[2023-01-02 22:58:19] <MotivationVortex> wouldn't it be false advertisment?

[2023-01-02 22:58:24] <@%momix99> i think so. since the account isnt really yours. you rent everything from WG basically @skill4ltu
[2023-01-02 22:58:25] <Johansson_88> if they could do it without issues, they wouldnt refund the cyka pershing

[2023-01-02 22:58:30] <+CheezeEater> they already silently nerfed skorpion
[2023-01-02 22:58:31] <%Szczurson> @skill4ltu Why not? Probably there is a sentence in a EULA that tanks are their property and we only "use" them
[2023-01-02 22:58:33] <HaroMangala> @skill4ltu  WG are too big and they will gateway with it ...COD is doing this all the time and silent change the game all the tyime and people have prove and nothing happens

[2023-01-02 23:35:57] <%Dav281> @PrettyPrincessPotato yes, that's why i think EBR is not beginner friendly, because 90% have just 3-4% survival rate LUL
