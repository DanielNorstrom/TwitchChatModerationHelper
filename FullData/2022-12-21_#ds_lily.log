[2022-12-21 17:56:47] <%Useless_Eater> @Kuglorf "“lesbian bed death” is when lesbians in long-term relationships either stop having sex altogether or have it very infrequently. Coined by Pepper Schwartz in 1983, it has its own Wikipedia page debating whether it’s a lesbophobic myth or a genuine problem and there's even a rock band of the same name! The general consensus is that whilst there may be statistics to indicate “bed death” is more prevalent in lesbian relationships, couples of all orientations experience it."

[2022-12-21 20:44:32] <%Konamikoden> kind of bad system that you're "disincentivized" to put down 480 bucks today, because any point purchase after that is unusable unless you want dupe packs I guess
[2022-12-21 20:44:36] <+digao941> i assume the phys converted to fire is useless for srs, thats why you have a lot of added chaos?
[2022-12-21 20:44:44] <auf_der_bahn_zuM_uRANUS> do I even keep animate guardian with occy + blasphemy setup?

[2022-12-21 20:45:16] <%Konamikoden> so it's better to wait until like december to buy the packs because you can use the point discount then instead
[2022-12-21 20:45:17] <auf_der_bahn_zuM_uRANUS> gems are pretty tight
[2022-12-21 20:45:20] <@%Kuglorf> its worth just for the leer cast + dying breath
[2022-12-21 20:46:02] <%Konamikoden> if you buy the 200 point pack you get that much off on your next supporter pack
