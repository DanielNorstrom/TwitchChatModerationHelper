[2022-12-19 10:51:29] <%+Hidefury> you take the power from battery all the time ... UPS depends on model can hold without power for some tine then is off .... UPS can save you for power outage and some times with electric shocks

[2022-12-19 10:52:31] <%+e4gl3m4n> best way to test how does work is to install the software from the UPS (there is a link in the user manual) and after that plug in something like a lamp and take the power cord from UPS out and see what happens

[2022-12-19 11:44:29] <@^Nightbot> Not a very good tank, kinda slow, bad gun, dpm isn't impressive either, bad penetration, rear mounted turret also bad, armor not reliable and it doesn't make credits since it's not premium!

[2022-12-19 11:55:14] <@^Nightbot> Totally broken tank, it makes Defender look like a baby.More lower plate armor than Minotauro and super small turret weakspot.Good penetration with both standard and gold, decent dmg capability, kinda slowish.If you care about the game don't buy this tank as it will ruin T6-T10 matchmaking.
