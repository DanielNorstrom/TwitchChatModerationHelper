[2022-12-18 23:32:46] <%JurgenRapp> pull 17 99,12% really ouch
[2022-12-18 23:40:45] <%JurgenRapp> it's interesting to see how hard it is to be consistent where every other pull is an early throw, ever for the best players, but I guess it's hard for so many players to stay focused.
[2022-12-18 23:42:28] <JurgenRapp> Also would be fun to see an AlphaGo like AI give it a try
