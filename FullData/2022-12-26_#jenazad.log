[2022-12-26 06:55:14] <+Uryll> they should have made her immortal like bbk
[2022-12-26 06:55:15] <RemixChillz> she good for gw and normal arena, but not rta
[2022-12-26 06:55:24] <TheRealestRj> K thx
[2022-12-26 06:55:47] <+Uryll> she needed more survival not freaking damage share ignore
[2022-12-26 06:55:56] <+Uryll> they are clueless about balance
[2022-12-26 06:55:57] <%Jublews> hey jena, chat
[2022-12-26 06:56:00] <Qinjaz> she's a good unit with 480 gs
[2022-12-26 06:56:01] <%+KosmicXIII> do i use my slate on my stene is it worth
[2022-12-26 06:56:14] <steardream> catJAM
[2022-12-26 06:56:24] <nyxxlul> the ignore element disadvantage is actually pretty good on celine s2
[2022-12-26 06:56:24] <%meatyoakair> sennykSleeper not first picking yulha
[2022-12-26 06:56:27] <dafuquiu_aerokiller> why would they give celine survivability
[2022-12-26 06:56:30] <+Uryll> this delta guy playing this game 24/7 or what
[2022-12-26 06:56:32] <+Uryll> i always see this dude

[2022-12-26 06:56:39] <TheRealestRj> @uryll yea she's kind of a 1 and done unit
[2022-12-26 06:56:43] <%rein_kraus> Jena doesnt use it on limiteds as well ok dont be fooled
[2022-12-26 06:57:05] <TheRealestRj> I dont have extra pen gear for celine anyways PepeHands

[2022-12-26 06:57:30] <%ML_Zahhak> think of it this way, celine is just a bad version of Politis
[2022-12-26 06:57:32] <Dark_Kidd> oh boi colin
[2022-12-26 06:57:38] <+Uryll> like how hard is it to just not press s3 and kill celine
[2022-12-26 06:57:40] <nyxxlul> 5Head that's why im telling you tank celine is the real tech

[2022-12-26 06:58:31] <%ML_Zahhak> in any situation ud wanna pick Celine just pick Politis instead, at least she has the passive CR crippling even if they dont use a non attack skill.  That cripples a lot of openers.
[2022-12-26 06:58:33] <+Uryll> like adin and arowell

[2022-12-26 07:09:19] <TheRealestRj> Im still a little confused on how karina works. When she def breaks does her splash dmg hit harder on that unit?
[2022-12-26 07:09:43] <TheRealestRj> Ah i see
[2022-12-26 07:09:44] <+trashdump2> u just need +30 artifact 5k defense karina and shes op SeemsGood

[2022-12-26 07:09:58] <dafuquiu_aerokiller> def break does more damage
[2022-12-26 07:10:00] <TheRealestRj> KEKW
[2022-12-26 07:10:04] <barald> and 200 ER ok
[2022-12-26 07:10:15] <dafuquiu_aerokiller> greater deffense buff
[2022-12-26 07:10:21] <%ML_Zahhak> @Jenazad i learned the trick is to ignore the ER and just go 3k def with def set and draft a def buffer like ARas or Alencia because u cant rely on her own def buff to be up.  Her damage is trash without def buff for sure.

[2022-12-26 07:22:03] <%ML_Zahhak> @severinus3 shes more reliable than a unit like rem since shes tankier she has more room to survive and pop off.  when rem sleeps she sleeps but Shoe provides team utility by just existing

[2022-12-26 07:24:32] <severinus3> @ML_Zahhak Eh I disagree, sure she has crit resist buff but her that's once again rng, and her counters are more rng cuz s2 has to proc. Just a wildly inconsistent unit

[2022-12-26 12:33:10] <Shirousa> but doesn't that apply to all souls games?
[2022-12-26 12:33:17] <Shirousa> it's just visually there in this game
[2022-12-26 12:33:34] <Shirousa> but that's with other souls games xd
[2022-12-26 12:33:40] <Shirousa> where you get your humanity back
[2022-12-26 12:33:40] <dizzydroid3r> anyone see the invader zim ep where he becomes convinced having more human organs makes him more passably human?
[2022-12-26 12:33:41] <%Sabdog> this game has world/character tendency too
[2022-12-26 12:33:42] <coolsilverstar> DS2 does that

[2022-12-26 12:35:33] <Shirousa> also what is that fog wall
