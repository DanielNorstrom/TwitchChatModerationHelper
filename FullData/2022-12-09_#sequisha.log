[2022-12-09 00:00:00] <+BobbyJee> @joshmutiny Overprime came out today also lol and fault
[2022-12-09 00:00:05] <adriiano20> Playing support ?
[2022-12-09 00:00:15] <%D0lphinLundgren> That red dude looks like the Anger character from Inside Out
[2022-12-09 00:00:26] <@%^Nightbot> Follow on twitter: @sequisha
[2022-12-09 00:00:27] <+MicktheFly> I played Overprime first and loved the third person moba. I played pred and it's def harder
[2022-12-09 00:00:39] <@%WeThePeople> @Oukeef seqHi
[2022-12-09 00:01:27] <vDriska> Did original Paragon have a card system, or was it just items as well
[2022-12-09 00:01:29] <vDriska> ?*
[2022-12-09 00:01:56] <+TheRuba> Riktor's hook is probably the most difficult skillshot to land in the game.
[2022-12-09 00:01:59] <+mitchlovesme> it was cards
[2022-12-09 00:01:59] <+Flowswitch> Cards i believe
[2022-12-09 00:02:06] <Starscream_019> cards
[2022-12-09 00:02:07] <+mitchlovesme> screw the cards
[2022-12-09 00:02:21] <%colamanX> seqF
[2022-12-09 00:02:34] <%Espresso_Junkie> They changed the cards at one point and totally destroyed the game.
[2022-12-09 00:02:52] <Starscream_019> yep last update
[2022-12-09 00:02:59] <VicRamen> homie bailed
[2022-12-09 00:03:03] <+mitchlovesme> if u didnt have good cards u were at a big disadvantage
[2022-12-09 00:03:08] <+TheRuba> Cards were cool and allowed theory crafting but they were so hard for new player onboarding.
[2022-12-09 00:03:27] <krauserza> what kind of game is this?
[2022-12-09 00:03:32] <Starscream_019> @mitchlovesme that changed  later
[2022-12-09 00:03:47] <%theReal_McCoy> optimus slime
[2022-12-09 00:03:56] <+Katsua_TheGamingKat> @krauserza a moba
[2022-12-09 00:03:56] <krauserza> is it like smite?
[2022-12-09 00:04:03] <+Katsua_TheGamingKat> somewhat
[2022-12-09 00:04:07] <%+autobotsteve349> @krauserza a shitty moba
[2022-12-09 00:04:07] <Starscream_019> yes
[2022-12-09 00:04:17] <+TheRuba> Like smite but actually 3d
[2022-12-09 00:04:31] <+Katsua_TheGamingKat> yea
[2022-12-09 00:04:31] <VicRamen> kill secured
[2022-12-09 00:04:31] <%theReal_McCoy> gotta em with the wigglies
[2022-12-09 00:04:34] <Starscream_019> more verticality
[2022-12-09 00:04:54] <+Katsua_TheGamingKat> it actually  takes advantage of the 3d plane
[2022-12-09 00:05:11] <krauserza> is it good?
[2022-12-09 00:05:22] <adriiano20> Good trade
[2022-12-09 00:05:43] <+Katsua_TheGamingKat> @krauserza haven't played it, but I did play it a bit in it's previous incarnation
[2022-12-09 00:05:58] <+Katsua_TheGamingKat> Paragon
[2022-12-09 00:06:08] <+Katsua_TheGamingKat> which was fun IMO
[2022-12-09 00:06:17] <+BobbyJee> you are the real carry Kappa
[2022-12-09 00:07:04] <%Omgeddon> Katsua the card aspect is gone now for an item system like other mobas
[2022-12-09 00:07:04] <@%Leminnz> Have you tried the elden ring coliseum yet?  @sequisha
[2022-12-09 00:07:13] <+Katsua_TheGamingKat> there's like 3 or 4 different games being made with Paragon's assets
[2022-12-09 00:07:28] <%Dgtldead> 2, currently
[2022-12-09 00:07:29] <%+Cravin85> i whip my chains back and fourth

[2022-12-09 00:07:31] <+Katsua_TheGamingKat> @Omgeddon sounds like it could be a step in the right direction

[2022-12-09 00:07:39] <%colamanX> yeah they just dropped the update out of nowhere
[2022-12-09 00:07:49] <@%Leminnz> They announced it like the day before it came out
[2022-12-09 00:07:56] <VicRamen> man i really need to go back to elden ring
[2022-12-09 00:08:01] <%Omgeddon> Aye it could be Katsua, I'll maybe try it after Midnight Suns
[2022-12-09 00:08:47] <@%Leminnz> If I had finished the game by now maybe I’d try it lol
[2022-12-09 00:08:50] <%Dgtldead> damn
[2022-12-09 00:08:50] <%+incrediblejoker> Midnight Suns has been fun AF to play

[2022-12-09 00:27:43] <ishpal10> @Yo_its_Bates they're both remakes of a game that released the assets for free after shutting down. both have their own takes, personally i prefer the pred version , its much better

[2022-12-09 00:33:47] <%Dgtldead> the problem with battleborn was that it should've just been a pve game

[2022-12-09 00:47:15] <%Dgtldead> i wonder how long they'll keep this up

[2022-12-09 00:47:29] <@%WeThePeople> I guess cause its free at launch?
[2022-12-09 00:47:39] <bunnehxx> Progression is the main thing
[2022-12-09 00:47:40] <Enderlinq_> @sequisha im a console player that’s the only reason for me
[2022-12-09 00:47:42] <%TonsOfun96> @julestemning while pred has 2 towers in each lane and feels a bit slower paced
[2022-12-09 00:47:49] <%Dgtldead> crosshair feels weird, easy to overshoot your range because you're looking at the crosshair 24 damn 7
[2022-12-09 00:47:57] <Enderlinq_> Full launch will be my chance to play on console
[2022-12-09 00:48:02] <%Dgtldead> that's what the range bar is for but my mind thinks shoot
[2022-12-09 00:48:09] <melodiousthonkvi> Probably people only play when it’s official. They’d rather play when the playerbase is at its peak.
[2022-12-09 00:48:25] <+Majestiic_GC> Pred is more of a traditional MOBA experience. Minions matter more. objectives matter more. If you shoot someone the minions attack you. It's more strategic
[2022-12-09 00:48:27] <ZedMu> @LastVVall damn well its free so ima see if i like the style of game
[2022-12-09 00:48:34] <+Majestiic_GC> OP is more of a brawler with lanes
[2022-12-09 00:48:39] <+OneInchMan87> usually people that played paragon legacy (not monolith crap) prefers overprime over predecessor
[2022-12-09 00:48:40] <+julestemning> @TonsOfun96 oh like fast paced thats a + :D.  might need to download both and try them out. played paragon ranked alot!.
[2022-12-09 00:49:02] <+julestemning> yeah monolith sucked

[2022-12-09 00:56:04] <+Jaeman_63> the gameplay on Op just seems faster but its kinda not pred you get punished fast if not careful
[2022-12-09 00:56:09] <bunnehxx> Yah I dont mess with overprime dashing
[2022-12-09 00:56:38] <bunnehxx> Its more of a overwatch experience rather than a moba
[2022-12-09 00:56:54] <%MrPeGz> This looks nuts
[2022-12-09 00:56:58] <Ventume> ^
[2022-12-09 00:57:03] <Enderlinq_> This Gideon need some milk.
[2022-12-09 00:57:04] <+Jaeman_63> what speed is that cam

[2022-12-09 00:58:02] <+Jaeman_63> F
[2022-12-09 00:58:08] <%Dgtldead> hasn't left lane, can't farm
[2022-12-09 00:58:10] <RickeySauce> Been loving this game. Prime looks good too i just couldnt bring myself to agree to the user agreement spyware lol
[2022-12-09 00:58:13] <%Dgtldead> best carry in the game
[2022-12-09 00:58:24] <+Jaeman_63> you mouse sensitivity
[2022-12-09 00:58:25] <%+Voidq> no speed cams around here KKona
[2022-12-09 00:58:29] <%Dgtldead> seriously though why do people play drongo
[2022-12-09 00:58:49] <BubbaGump30> This game looks awesome! I bet it will be even better when ranked is added
[2022-12-09 00:58:51] <%Dgtldead> imo drongo has always been underbaked
[2022-12-09 00:59:11] <melodiousthonkvi> Does last hitting minions matter or do you just need to be close to them as they die?
[2022-12-09 00:59:27] <+Jaeman_63> you guys should grap it be for the 50% of thing ends next week
[2022-12-09 00:59:42] <RickeySauce> Yes you need to last hit just like any moba @melodiousthonkvi
[2022-12-09 01:00:03] <VAMPIREPLAZA> KEKHeim
[2022-12-09 01:00:10] <PlanetRez> that damage was insane
[2022-12-09 01:00:49] <%TonsOfun96> @melodiousthonkvi you get exp nomater what if your inrange but you only get gold if you last hit
[2022-12-09 01:00:58] <Enderlinq_> Last hit gives a gold bonus right? Been a while
[2022-12-09 01:00:59] <CM5tarke> Well well well
[2022-12-09 01:01:20] <PlanetRez> @cm5tarke VoHiYo
[2022-12-09 01:01:22] <CM5tarke> @Enderlinq_ last hitting gives gold period. no bonus.
[2022-12-09 01:01:38] <CM5tarke> Certain minions are worth more @Enderlinq_ like seige
[2022-12-09 01:01:47] <PlanetRez> wards are your friend with a kallari running around
[2022-12-09 01:01:54] <Enderlinq_> Thanks, my bad asked that literally after they just said it too I feel dumb
[2022-12-09 01:01:57] <%TonsOfun96> @Enderlinq_ only way too get gold from minions is too last hit otherwhise they only give exp when they die
[2022-12-09 01:02:24] <CM5tarke> Dont forget your stasis @Sequisha !
[2022-12-09 01:02:32] <RushFrog> uhhh KEKW

[2022-12-09 01:03:13] <+TheMGamer2804> Eyo is this Paragon renamed?
[2022-12-09 01:03:19] <RickeySauce> thye make a huge difference
[2022-12-09 01:03:23] <PlanetRez> statis is a item correct?
[2022-12-09 01:03:29] <RushFrog> zhonyas
[2022-12-09 01:03:33] <VAMPIREPLAZA> oldClown
[2022-12-09 01:03:33] <symN_> Yas like Hour Glas
[2022-12-09 01:03:38] <PlanetRez> or is it standard every hero gets it now?
[2022-12-09 01:03:47] <PlanetRez> that would be weird
[2022-12-09 01:04:13] <symN_> @PlanetRez Yes it's a Crest item so not every hero gets it
[2022-12-09 01:04:16] <%+CrowdCtrlAlt> They went all out with the attack options and animation Kappa
[2022-12-09 01:04:25] <PlanetRez> makes sense
[2022-12-09 01:04:25] <symN_> you technically could but doesn't make sense
[2022-12-09 01:04:48] <mm5077> Is this game in ps5 or only pc ?
[2022-12-09 01:05:01] <Enderlinq_> @mm5077 soon they said

[2022-12-09 01:05:40] <Enderlinq_> They have a new team working on console version now if I’m not mistaken
[2022-12-09 01:05:46] <mm5077> @enderlinq_ thank you
[2022-12-09 01:06:10] <RushFrog> ask support to ward ontop of the teamfight for killari invis @Sequisha
[2022-12-09 01:06:29] <RickeySauce> hold C lol its a shitty ping system
[2022-12-09 01:06:30] <Louisere1> press C to open team comms
[2022-12-09 01:06:34] <+TheMGamer2804> there is no button to use mouse to click somewhere on the map?

[2022-12-09 01:06:58] <melodiousthonkvi> Quickcoms definitely adds to the competitiveness. Like pings and quickchat, quickemotes, etc.

[2022-12-09 01:08:34] <+IndoorAfrican> c is default ping in this
[2022-12-09 01:08:55] <melodiousthonkvi> It’s one thing knowing how to ping. It’s another if your team knows what your intentions are. pbtvLUL

[2022-12-09 01:25:40] <predzEU> its by far the smoothest paragon remake
[2022-12-09 01:25:55] <+its_crisp_> roadhog pov
[2022-12-09 01:26:01] <%Dgtldead> i mean a GT 1030 is pretty low end card, even older series cards that are halfway decent could run this
[2022-12-09 01:26:30] <%Dgtldead> considering this is still a version of unreal, it shouldn't be too difficult in general
[2022-12-09 01:26:37] <PlanetRez> my fiance has a 980 that runs this like butter
[2022-12-09 01:26:45] <%+bipolarxpress> @predzEU More like Smite. But looks way more smooth IMO
[2022-12-09 01:27:16] <PlanetRez> it's like if smite and gears of war had a baby
[2022-12-09 01:27:49] <%+decado6> its just smite, reskinned
[2022-12-09 01:27:50] <%Dgtldead> more like if Unreal Tournament became a moba Kappa
[2022-12-09 01:27:50] <%+bipolarxpress> I'm glad you played this @Sequisha I may have never discovered it the way things are so saturated.
[2022-12-09 01:27:51] <predzEU> nah its more like paragon im playing pred and my playtime was 110 days in paragon before servers closed
[2022-12-09 01:27:55] <predzEU> and it isnt like smite

[2022-12-09 01:29:13] <PlanetRez> yeah this one plays so much different than smite
[2022-12-09 01:29:16] <%+bipolarxpress> Smite released in 2014
[2022-12-09 01:29:16] <%PhilRamirez> im guessing sequisha isn't bothering with the vga's
[2022-12-09 01:29:21] <Enderlinq_> @blushell good point
[2022-12-09 01:29:24] <%Dgtldead> similar games doesn't mean its a reskin
[2022-12-09 01:29:59] <+arszenki> i want a game like this so bad that's not lane based just like the others that already exist; paragon, smite, ect.  Something with a different primary play mode
[2022-12-09 01:30:02] <%PhilRamirez> oh i didn't know that
[2022-12-09 01:30:05] <DonMAA> Smite never appealed to me at all but this is fun
[2022-12-09 01:30:11] <%+decado6> Paragon actually came out March 2016 lmao

[2022-12-09 01:30:55] <+bwerso> so there 3 of these out now with paragon assets ? is there any difference between them ?
[2022-12-09 01:31:02] <Enderlinq_> Y’all remember the paragon refund. I was a bit embarrassed how much I spent on that game LUL
[2022-12-09 01:31:10] <%Dgtldead> 2 of them, fault is dead @bwerso
[2022-12-09 01:31:12] <%GGibs> who tf cares when smite, paragon, barbie's dreamhouse, or anything came out? enjoy the game, enjoy watching the game. or don't
[2022-12-09 01:31:20] <predzEU> there is only 2, fault dead
[2022-12-09 01:31:26] <+Frenzilla> A lot of people say Predecessor is the best but can't confirm
[2022-12-09 01:31:28] <%+decado6> yeah i got refunded a crap ton too enderlinq_
[2022-12-09 01:31:39] <PlanetRez> a pretty good but @bwerso this one goes for more of a monolith map feel and overprime goes for an og legacy map feel.
[2022-12-09 01:31:43] <BxHaZe87> LUL
[2022-12-09 01:31:56] <DonMAA> at least they refunded. That is respectable
[2022-12-09 01:32:01] <+Blushell> Lots of differences in gameplay mechanics, items and even abilities of the characters. @bwerso
[2022-12-09 01:32:07] <%+Baltimoar> ez Double
[2022-12-09 01:32:13] <Enderlinq_> @decado6 I didn’t even realize, but over time I guess it’s not hard. 20 here 20 there adds up LUL

[2022-12-09 01:32:19] <predzEU> OP is more brawly and faster, Pred is slower. OP is a homage to Legacy map Pred is a homage to monolith
[2022-12-09 01:32:36] <%+TypeG> am I allowed to make fun of the launcher though
[2022-12-09 01:32:38] <%+decado6> lmao tell that to my dota 2 spent money!  yeeesh
