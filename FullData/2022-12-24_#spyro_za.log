[2022-12-24 12:27:36] <+neotrunks111> @Spyro_ZA hey man, coming from a filthy casual, I've found more success by including Anseís in starting deck instead of vandergrift. Because he is just too good with temple not to have him consistently every match. vandergrift is just a nice bonus coming off temple, not a priority imho
