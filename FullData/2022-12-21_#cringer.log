[2022-12-21 15:47:46] <%+Ctl_alt_del> Yep.  Without a doubt, our first  encounter with an alien civilization will be coming across their garbage. abstra4Ups
[2022-12-21 15:48:19] <%Avidbreather> satellite debris, dead drones on other planets, man we're messy
[2022-12-21 15:48:28] <%$k_nord> there are "plans" to create space garbage collectors by various space institutes, but I haven't heard of anyone working with it
[2022-12-21 15:48:28] <%itssalsashark> @Ctl_alt_del What if WE are another alien civilization's junk?
[2022-12-21 15:48:43] <%+JackDeez79> Probably...
[2022-12-21 15:49:10] <%FlareSN> we'll figure it out once it becomes more of a problem lmao
[2022-12-21 15:49:25] <+danneoo1> depending on how you define "space" with exception to a few Apollo missions, everything else has been in earth orbit

[2022-12-21 15:49:42] <%+Ctl_alt_del> Not impossible @itssalsashark , but still going to find garbage.  Pollution is a recursive algorithm.
[2022-12-21 15:49:46] <%+RhedZirus> thats why they are working on lab grown black holes to open up in satellite orbit to vacuum away the debris
[2022-12-21 15:49:46] <%mikkeos> @flaresn it already is a massive issue
[2022-12-21 15:49:56] <@%$Asiak> But the earth is in space so technically we've been in space for billions of years

[2022-12-21 15:50:41] <%FlareSN> @mikkeos  ye ik, being sarcastic
[2022-12-21 15:50:42] <%itssalsashark> in all honesty, the ISS is in a very specific orbit, but it's still weird they would cancel a mission for that. Hitting debris in orbit would be like hitting an asteroid in the asteroid belt at high speed.
[2022-12-21 15:50:57] <%RyuSheng> I mean let's face it, humans can't go anywhere without dropping litter all over
[2022-12-21 15:51:24] <$kett41> didnt china destroy one of their satellites to test a weapon and that debri caused a lot of problems

[2022-12-21 15:52:39] <%Shi__Nobi> @kett41 well China also dropped something near a city in Africa but yes they added a few thousand satellites with that
[2022-12-21 15:52:47] <+danneoo1> only Japanese should be aloud in space, they always tidy up after themselves
