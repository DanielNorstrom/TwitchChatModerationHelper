[2023-01-01 15:30:22] <@%^Nightbot> Seriously??? Unreal. I am sick and tired of this! you do this shit 5 times a month! I will never be back. If Netflix took as many days off as you they'd get sued. No different here. People pay for what's advertised. Not for unscheduled downtime during a pandemic. Unbelievable.

[2023-01-01 16:21:24] <%RandomMarieChick> I’m so sorry. I respectfully disagree. The development studies show kids under 16 only have to hear something like 20 times before they believe it. So if one feeds unsafe things to a child, they will fall for it. So, I prefer to protect kids. Now, as an adult, you have every right to be stupid.

[2023-01-01 18:10:54] <%+0lincoln0> Pulse-width modulation, or pulse-duration modulation, is a method of reducing the average power delivered by an electrical signal, by effectively chopping it up into discrete parts. The average value of voltage fed to the load is controlled by turning the switch between supply and load on and off at a fast rate
[2023-01-01 18:10:55] <+Face_32> perpendicular osculation is very important @JonBams

[2023-01-01 18:56:19] <DeezNuts_> All those item frames wouldnt cause any lag lol
[2023-01-01 18:56:20] <LoLTechtonic> @JonBams how far along are you to the every farm goal
[2023-01-01 18:56:22] <ClutchCard> At 10,000,000 sand shoveled would you consider duping sand?
[2023-01-01 18:56:34] <!%$DeePick> how tiny can you keep the save file and have all the same farms as BDB LUL
[2023-01-01 18:56:43] <%+DEPjrTX> You need to build a "World Eater" machine
[2023-01-01 18:56:45] <%$redghost29> finish the mob zoo
[2023-01-01 18:56:54] <%pissgallon> @4tw0ne it's a great building material, just gotta get the motivation to start it. I'll probably be on later
[2023-01-01 18:57:03] <%$ayyfro> JonBams i think this is right - 1,004 items: 781 stackable items 17 shulker boxes 41 books (max Level) 27 tools 36 combat items (defensive and attack) 39 tiped arrows (stack but rarely used) 63 potions (all levels) excluding dragon breath because it stacks
[2023-01-01 18:57:04] <larsonite> that does sound cool. you could show the progress of minecraft of the years
[2023-01-01 18:57:11] <%Tetsaiga> How many subs for you to sidetrack and find my name on a tree at the lighthouse?

[2023-01-01 18:57:28] <mister_cursed> torch farm?
[2023-01-01 18:57:32] <larsonite> you don't have a dolphin farm, just sayin
[2023-01-01 18:57:33] <+Face_32> would you build a TnT duping machine when Mojang finally break it? @JonBams
[2023-01-01 18:57:35] <LoLTechtonic> oh wow. thats a lot of farms

[2023-01-01 18:57:35] <!%smokey750> Cheer100 Cheer100 You should make a simple cat farm where you just breed them all, and every time chat pisses you off, you cull some of them on stream
[2023-01-01 18:57:39] <frettytom> Is there not a sandstone farm that automatically gives you sandstone
[2023-01-01 18:57:48] <%$OmIAm> Dripstone lava farms are great for early game furnaces when you need to make a bunch of glass or something.
[2023-01-01 18:58:11] <%$Maneo_86> @smokey750 my initial iron farm was a cat farm too, I stopped the cat spawns but it was kinda horrific when I first turned the farm on
[2023-01-01 18:58:19] <+Lachy> Do you ever plan on tweaking with datapacks?
[2023-01-01 18:58:23] <%Tetsaiga> Should just make TNT easier to craft
[2023-01-01 18:58:24] <%RobRuLT> Do you think they’ll ever make TNT less expensive?
[2023-01-01 18:58:29] <Kikclle> tnt duping is such an important "feature" they cant remove it
[2023-01-01 18:58:30] <%$ruthlessrellik> lobbying Mojang to keep tnt duping
[2023-01-01 18:58:40] <!%4tw0ne> I think its more of a code based issue. too much legacy code needs a rework first
[2023-01-01 18:58:40] <birdlikescheese> i mean tnt duping is easy for farms
[2023-01-01 18:58:56] <DeezNuts_> They said it wont leave because of the sci servers and edu servers
[2023-01-01 18:59:00] <larsonite> not to steal ideas, but have you seen DocM break minecraft? he brought the dragon to the overworld. any interest in stuff like that?

[2023-01-01 18:59:12] <%+DEPjrTX> ImpulseSV had a good point about duping, it's required for flying machine TNT because there are no moving containers in Java
