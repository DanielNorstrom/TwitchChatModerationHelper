[2022-12-17 05:38:52] <%+Zithras2> The problem with experimenting is that if it works out really well, you can never remember what you changed from the recipe :(
[2022-12-17 05:38:53] <%AeroRaiser> I'll dm the link to you ^_^
[2022-12-17 05:39:12] <%+Hyperstryke> That sounds tasty.

[2022-12-17 06:57:24] <+Cirvante> Okay but the "5 seconds of emo Saku hair" look actually works lmao
[2022-12-17 06:57:29] <%+Rozalyndis> like game music owners are usually pretty cool like "oh thanks for using our music and thanks for getting folks interested in our game. yeah we're glad you spread for us"

[2022-12-17 07:58:32] <Rashkavar> but amazon.ca ships within country?  That's weird!

[2022-12-17 07:59:36] <Rashkavar> ohh, right, that's why, I generally go for the free shipping over X price, which is all the fulfilled by amazon stuff
[2022-12-17 07:59:49] <+Kaithar> the amount of stuff on amazon that's shipped from China is amazing
[2022-12-17 07:59:51] <%+Zithras2> There's a *lot* of China-based sellers on Amazon.com, you can usually post it by the 5+ days shipping

[2022-12-17 08:00:01] <emteecalories> @zithras2 yeah, great, that's the word we'll use since this is a wholesome stream

[2022-12-17 08:00:07] <Rashkavar> because otherwise it's like "oh hey this reseller is $5 cheaper but they charge $30 shipping, yay"

[2022-12-17 08:00:32] <Rashkavar> even without the duties, the shipping & handling alone can be a ripoff
[2022-12-17 08:01:28] <%+Zithras2> Ebay's super bad about that - $5 item with $30 shipping is a trap - but shows up higher on the list than the $15 item

[2022-12-17 08:10:59] <%Spawnkillers> Cold enough where you don't need to wear fuzzy socks and gloves is the perfect cold.
[2022-12-17 08:11:02] <!%$cybertyche> I already have to plug in my car... but that's because it's an electric car LUL

[2022-12-17 08:11:27] <%+Zithras2> he has a great sales strategy - make people accidentally buy stuff
[2022-12-17 08:11:29] <Ezzlin> So you have to get x number of pieces in order to defeat Ganon and beat the game, I think that is a cool goal
[2022-12-17 08:11:40] <Rashkavar> -40 is the same in both systems
[2022-12-17 08:11:46] <@%madelsberger> -40 is the same, so -30C must be -22F
[2022-12-17 08:11:48] <emteecalories> -40 is -40 in both F and C

[2022-12-17 08:12:39] <Ezzlin> Yeah I agree I think it should finish when you get your pieces
[2022-12-17 08:13:13] <!%$cybertyche> I walked around Calgary once when it was about -40 with windchill. Seeing young women there wearing parkas and miniskirts was very odd.
[2022-12-17 08:13:27] <Ezzlin> One benefit I can see is if you're in a multiworld
[2022-12-17 08:13:49] <Ezzlin> Although you could just forfeit at that point and give out your items
[2022-12-17 08:14:01] <Ezzlin> But that's not as fun

[2022-12-17 08:14:28] <Rashkavar> I saw a thing recently on military operations in the cold, and yeah, what you said checks out.  -5 to +5 is bad because that's the range where it's kinda cold but you also have to deal with the wet and the slippery.  -20 and below you start getting increasing difficulties just because it gets increasingly terrible in general

[2022-12-17 08:46:48] <@%madelsberger> it makes NO assumption about how you will spend the keys
[2022-12-17 08:46:56] <Rashkavar> fair point
[2022-12-17 08:47:00] <@%madelsberger> If it assumed you'd make "bad" decisions, then the least reasonable location would be in logic
[2022-12-17 08:47:19] <Rashkavar> it allows you to make bad decisions, then
[2022-12-17 08:47:52] <@%madelsberger> Sure.  But in keysanity you still don't want to
[2022-12-17 08:48:00] <Rashkavar> true

[2022-12-17 08:48:29] <%+xyzzy_44> Yeah, it makes sure that EVERY possible key spending permutation will still leave you in a winnable state. Which, is *sort of* like always assuming you'll make the worst decisions, but not technically the same thing.

[2022-12-17 09:12:38] <@%madelsberger> Early in my career I worked with a guy who argued for releasing software that wasn't ready, on this logic:  "So-and-so just released such-and-such game and it made $1 million (or whatever) per month in sales.  So a one month delay costs the company $1 million dollars."  To which I replied, "oh, you thinki that game wil make $1M every month, starting on release and continuing forever?"  (spoilers: no, though somehow he failed to acknowledge this)
[2022-12-17 09:12:43] <Rashkavar> yeah, with bugs and things like uninspired graphics and such, I will always blame the publisher first, unless there's something to indicate it's a dev problem.  If it's core game design choices, then I'll blame the devs
[2022-12-17 09:12:46] <@%+Skarthe> Vault of Glass should be up not this coming week, but the week after, I believe
[2022-12-17 09:13:06] <beerman247> Do you play destiny on stream?
[2022-12-17 09:13:27] <%Ezzlin> Yeah you can't assume any particular revenue from a game
[2022-12-17 09:13:32] <@%madelsberger> Premature releases can typically be expected to cost the company money due to reputation of bugginess, but people LOVE to make excuses for doing a half-arsed job with software
[2022-12-17 09:13:55] <Steve87CPFC> Oh how was the Lirum part in Lost Odyssey?
[2022-12-17 09:14:00] <@%TheInfamousBug> Pewpew shooty game where you launch rockets into the back of Skarthe is "Chill" sakuThink

[2022-12-17 09:14:11] <Rashkavar> indeed, made - if you need an example of a game being ruined by its release reputation, look at no man's sky

[2022-12-17 09:14:34] <@%DiscoTech90> so true
[2022-12-17 09:15:05] <+Kaithar> it's a complicated gamble
[2022-12-17 09:15:08] <@%DiscoTech90> yeah cyberpunk is apparently decent but i have no interest in hearing about it still
[2022-12-17 09:15:08] <@%TheInfamousBug> Wasn't there a really recent release with all kinds of framerate issues?
[2022-12-17 09:15:14] <@%+Skarthe> Enough that they also delisted it from the Playstation store for a while.
[2022-12-17 09:15:15] <teckEH> no man's sky is amazing now, tbh
[2022-12-17 09:15:40] <+Kaithar> one reason they release early is that they hope the sales will cover the continuing development
[2022-12-17 09:15:57] <%itsClamp> CP2077 is really good now, but I know a lot of people who still won't touch it
[2022-12-17 09:15:57] <Rashkavar> cyberpunk is such a shame too because CDPR had a pretty decent reputation for being able to release something viable

[2022-12-17 09:16:41] <@%DiscoTech90> yeah, kaithar and unfortunatley that strat works
[2022-12-17 09:16:44] <+Kaithar> another is that corp will push to try and get a minimum viable out because otherwise they risk unending delays and "it's not perfect"
[2022-12-17 09:16:45] <Rashkavar> good to know, itsClamp - it's still on my wishlist, I just didn't buy it because my computer at the time was struggling to run witcher 3
[2022-12-17 09:16:50] <beerman247> also fallout 76 was a mess
[2022-12-17 09:16:56] <%Ezzlin> Early access doesn't really work as well for AAA games
[2022-12-17 09:16:56] <@%+k3vlar12> everyone is just following the Star Citizen model

[2022-12-17 09:17:12] <!%$Murnco> There are downsides to open or even closed beta to the public. Spoilers datamining bad impressions. Things that NDAs should cover that are broken.
[2022-12-17 09:17:23] <@%DiscoTech90> that's why i wont support those games - if it had flopped like it should have, then gotten better sure maybe it deserves a million sales. but if you get a million off hype and let ppl down i'm not adding to your sales
[2022-12-17 09:17:23] <@StreamlootsBot> Support me on Streamloots https://l.stls.to/vhTRw0
[2022-12-17 09:17:48] <@%DiscoTech90> @Ezzlin that's fair.
[2022-12-17 09:18:03] <%Ezzlin> I feel like sometimes early access can also make people decide that they don't like your game even before it's out
[2022-12-17 09:18:21] <+Kaithar> yeah, that's pretty much the gamble bit, whether they can correctly assess the playability of the game... it fails a lot
[2022-12-17 09:18:32] VIEWERS: 166
[2022-12-17 09:18:35] <Rashkavar> thing is, in the old days when we had carts, we just...got a game to a point where it works before release
[2022-12-17 09:18:38] <@%DiscoTech90> yeah i'd def agree there are several ways an early access can kneecap your game unfort
[2022-12-17 09:19:00] <Steve87CPFC> but the amount of people disappionted by early access or open/closed beta is a lot less opposed to a inadequate game on release
[2022-12-17 09:19:09] <beerman247> that shouldnt happen in 2022
[2022-12-17 09:19:24] <Rashkavar> LTTP1.0 is definitely not running perfectly, look at all the glitches we exploit in competitive rando races.....but it works *enough*

[2022-12-17 09:19:30] <@%madelsberger> Entertainment industries generally don't get to operate on the theory of "start with minimum viable".  If a company wants to adapt agile to games (and btw, in most cases they don't; they just misuse the terminology), they need an industry-aware definition of "viable"
[2022-12-17 09:19:37] <teckEH> even with SWSH. there were all the autosave memory issues.
[2022-12-17 09:19:58] <@%+Skarthe> Sword/Shield
[2022-12-17 09:20:05] <+Kaithar> yeah, the big houses really  are pushing it too far... I think it's mostly marketing that stops them doing early access too

[2022-12-17 09:21:42] <Steve87CPFC> how are you finiding Lost Odyssey?
[2022-12-17 09:21:51] <@%madelsberger> @DiscoTech90 Do you have specific questions?  It's a pretty broad topic...  Generally MVP (minimum viable) refers to the idea that you're going to improve a thing incrementally while it's in use.  And it IS a successful strategy for a lot of software
[2022-12-17 09:22:01] <Rashkavar> I know Vampire the Masquerade: Bloodlines had a glitch in its initial release that would cause the whole save folder to get corrupted pretty far through it...but even though the devs were going bankrupt because of their publisher hecking them over, some of them came in on their own time to make 2 patches that got it up to functional
[2022-12-17 09:22:07] <%Ezzlin> Wait what?
[2022-12-17 09:22:11] <%Hiei408> Lost odyssey has good moments

[2022-12-17 09:22:20] <teckEH> yeah, I can see that. different things dampen peoples mood about it. heck. look at mass effect 3's original ending fiasco, I'm not sure if that franchise has recovered since that
[2022-12-17 09:22:31] <@%+Skarthe> I don't think the content violation was for loving the game, I think the content violation was for loving two very specific parts of the game.  :P

[2022-12-17 09:23:05] <@%+Skarthe> @teckEH Ok, let's be fair; Mass Effect 3's endings left a bad taste but not as bad of one as Andromeda as a whole did
[2022-12-17 09:23:06] <@%madelsberger> And a game that, for example, randomly fails to save... ins't.

[2022-12-17 09:26:39] <@%madelsberger> So, when a game company tries to say their prematue release is a "minimum viable", they're borrowing agile terminology to sound hip to modern dev thinking -- but I'll bet at rather extreme odds that they aren't really doing agile development
