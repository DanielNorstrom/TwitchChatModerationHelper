[2022-12-22 12:13:59] <GarlicMayo_> the griddy is so toxic this year

[2022-12-22 12:33:21] <seeeebe> got wc zambrotta w or l?
[2022-12-22 12:33:21] <+Jmste> no date yet but insta post said its done
[2022-12-22 12:33:23] <r0bs0n11> Who should i play ? two out of three. Van dijk, Cordoba, TOTT Gvardiol pls?
[2022-12-22 12:33:28] <%+waaweynka> the game is now more about "the team" attributes rather than the focus on individual brilliance
[2022-12-22 12:33:35] <humza_c> @sp00dercat how many packs u got saved I have 70 so far
[2022-12-22 12:33:50] <bothunter25> i can only afford R9 when the game is about to end and 85x10 comes with R9 SBC LUL LUL LUL
[2022-12-22 12:34:00] <%xylexxy> @humza_c holy respect
[2022-12-22 12:34:03] <+mofeba> @waaweynka yeah exactly. Individuality is dead. Oiling the machine is the way football is going
[2022-12-22 12:34:04] <SUMZUH> Of course
[2022-12-22 12:34:12] <%DNimmo> Not to that extent
[2022-12-22 12:34:23] <%+thejasperb> darwin nunez is the new goat
[2022-12-22 12:34:24] <%+waaweynka> the gap between the average and the elite will regress to the mean of the average
[2022-12-22 12:34:24] <r0bs0n11> Who should i play ? two out of three. Van dijk, Cordoba, TOTT Gvardiol pls?
[2022-12-22 12:34:25] <SUMZUH> It‚Äôs inevitable
[2022-12-22 12:34:27] <+Dannym300> sports science will allow people to performane at higher levels
[2022-12-22 12:34:27] <%+Skovzy> looool
[2022-12-22 12:34:27] <+Vexarex> isn't Mbappe faster or at least as fast
[2022-12-22 12:34:28] <%DNimmo> There‚Äôs a point where it‚Äôs physically impossible for people to just get faster
[2022-12-22 12:34:29] <seeeebe> got wc zambrotta w or l?
[2022-12-22 12:34:37] <%+waaweynka> so we will rarely see Messi/Ronaldos
[2022-12-22 12:34:37] <%aidan_acluvsufan_fan> how much more can we progress something like messis dribbling
[2022-12-22 12:34:41] <%+Atartico> hey stokes do you rate any OCE pros?
[2022-12-22 12:34:47] <+benseed1> yes and when does it stop? like people just keep getting faster and faster? faster than bolt, then faster and faster and faster, when does it stop lol
[2022-12-22 12:34:49] <%DNimmo> Mbappe as fast as bolt, did I read that right
[2022-12-22 12:34:49] <+daniel_lee21> i saw a study that bolt has basically ran the fastest any human body is capable of doing
[2022-12-22 12:34:50] <gy_____> @aidan_acluvsufan_fan didnt ask
[2022-12-22 12:34:52] <%+oioimush89> when i was younger Tony hawks did a 900, now theres 12 year olds doing 1080s
[2022-12-22 12:34:54] <+saurabh_17> are you playing narrow
[2022-12-22 12:34:59] <bothunter25> i don't think there will ever be anyone like Messi
[2022-12-22 12:35:01] <%+waaweynka> but if we do see a Messi he will have different attributes but with his consistency
[2022-12-22 12:35:06] <@^Nightbot> It would be greatly appreciated if you followed my main socials: Insta - https://www.instagram.com/stokesfifa/ Twitter - https://twitter.com/Hashtag_Stokes
[2022-12-22 12:35:12] <Danielnarus> Yeah, Messi is the greatest footballer of all time till now. but thinking there wont be a better in time, if you are one of those who think there wont be anyone.. i got news for u bro.. ur dumb.. Stokes is in the right here
[2022-12-22 12:35:13] <+Dannym300> you remember more fifa pro names than i remember family members names
[2022-12-22 12:35:13] <actually_eugene> @surkkkk Clubs don't drop offers just because a big team has an eye on the same player. Look at Joao Felix for example... A lot of team are in the race of trying to sign him. And, it's not always about the money for all players.

[2022-12-22 12:35:19] <+mofeba> Nah. Especially it‚Äôs becoming a flat curve. You can only get so good before the difference starts to diminish
[2022-12-22 12:35:19] <+HaloBrazy> @aidan_acluvsufan_fan drone
[2022-12-22 12:35:22] <%rygn922> how does you guys save pack for so long, whats the fun in that lol
[2022-12-22 12:35:23] <%+waaweynka> rarely do you find Messi/Ronaldo consistency
[2022-12-22 12:35:24] <humza_c> @xylexxy it's been a week so far hopefully can get a shit ton before toty
[2022-12-22 12:35:26] <dankoo028> gold neymar or di maria?
[2022-12-22 12:35:31] <%DNimmo> Can we get var out for that Mbappe is faster than bolt
[2022-12-22 12:35:33] <@%+fifa_swift22> what is he cooking
[2022-12-22 12:35:34] <paulronaldo7> Injuries are the biggest enemy of longevity and that's where messi and ronaldo were lucky to get as least as possible
[2022-12-22 12:35:37] <+frazmo_> I don‚Äôt think there will be players like this ever again, football is too athletic that someone that likes to dribble and beat players have that taken out of them if there to make it at the top level
[2022-12-22 12:35:41] <@%+fifa_swift22> 4321 formation is glitched
[2022-12-22 12:35:43] <SirPkP> hello fam, did you get anything nice in packs
[2022-12-22 12:35:47] <@%+fifa_swift22> they always find the free man
[2022-12-22 12:35:49] <hammar711> al owairan is such a disgusting card
[2022-12-22 12:35:54] <%aidan_acluvsufan_fan> this discussion wont close the gap at the top of the SPL tbf
[2022-12-22 12:36:00] <%+waaweynka> @mofeba üëåüëå
[2022-12-22 12:36:07] <wowzie7> mid gullit still worth it this game
[2022-12-22 12:36:08] <r0bs0n11> I have Van dijk, Cordoba, TOTT Gvardiol, Which two i should play ?
[2022-12-22 12:36:11] <SUMZUH> realistically Reece james is better than messi
[2022-12-22 12:36:18] <%Dzoney_> stokes when someone asks you what player is better, i can imagine you in futbin just reading all the players stats at the start of the year like yeah this guys good
[2022-12-22 12:36:21] <%+SentedSul> what was that cross R2 Square or normal square
[2022-12-22 12:36:27] <+st0vies26> !4231

[2022-12-22 12:36:28] <%+Skovzy> im wanting that new saint max
[2022-12-22 12:36:39] <%muwx19> My goat pokes
[2022-12-22 12:36:40] <+benjf1> i think mid gullit will rise. he crashed too much
[2022-12-22 12:36:46] <imran_rzk> I'm losing so many coins but don't see point selling, waiting and then buying the same players back
[2022-12-22 12:36:54] <+mofeba> @danielnarus I mean I won‚Äôt really say they are dumb. Individuality in the game is dying. It‚Äôs becoming more of a greatest team of all time than player so that‚Äôs something. Also there‚Äôs not much that can be improved upon at this stage in football. You‚Äôll need to be damn near perfect to beat what we have now
[2022-12-22 12:36:54] <r0bs0n11> I have Van dijk, Cordoba, TOTT Gvardiol, Which two i should play ?

[2022-12-22 12:38:05] <Danielnarus> @mofeba But dont u think we as humans just gonna get closer and closer to perfection in case of athletes over the next decades?
[2022-12-22 12:38:05] <+joshcorleone> do you think theres bots in div rivals or is everyone an actual person

[2022-12-22 12:38:28] <%oOoOdavidOoOo> i cant understand how IF neymar is 500k more than his gold just for the position
[2022-12-22 12:38:30] <SUMZUH> Do u recommend taking coins or risk it taking tradable?
[2022-12-22 12:38:39] <haim9898> R9 mid 5.3 no cheap????
[2022-12-22 12:38:44] <%+JustKrepto> if you play the game you will lose money tbh
[2022-12-22 12:38:49] <%+Skovzy> think market drops heavier tomorrow

[2022-12-22 12:39:29] <imran_rzk> Mud your whole club into 81+ upgrades, then take untrades ro restock it
[2022-12-22 12:39:33] <+joshcorleone> do you think theres bots in div rivals or is everyone an actual person
[2022-12-22 12:39:34] <%+Harwoodinho> @JustKrepto Exactly mate, if I find myself ever worrying about a virtual market thats when I know I need to stop playing
[2022-12-22 12:39:38] <%CHAZINHOOO> I‚Äôve tried going liquid but end up buying a team 2 days later
[2022-12-22 12:39:41] <heatwave180> @dpowerdjnr üòÇüòÇ
[2022-12-22 12:39:42] <%FALSE9lNE> i wont lie, im running full untradable and just trading. find it more fun and then toty ill buy a team
[2022-12-22 12:39:47] <%CHAZINHOOO> I‚Äôve easily lost 2 mil or so
[2022-12-22 12:39:48] <%+jammymctavish> yeah i think of your club is really stacked go tradeable - if you've sunk a lot of players into sbc's and need to bulk club out again just go untradeable
[2022-12-22 12:39:56] <bothunter25> even if I have millions i always play undrsdeable .
[2022-12-22 12:40:00] <%Dzoney_> stokes when people ask you about certain cards, have you actually tried them out or how do you identify they are a good card or not
[2022-12-22 12:40:06] <%+Skovzy> nothing stopping me form saint max and vaeane
