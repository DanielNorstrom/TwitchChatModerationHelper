[2022-12-22 10:38:22] <minh9dngt> @yergoood  ?? are u tiktok football fan.They are Asian champion.They are a strong Asian team tbh
[2022-12-22 10:38:27] <nevemlaci> @mxnsoor Also you get FIRST POOL qualification, meaning you will have a relatively easy group.
[2022-12-22 10:38:28] <+anti_materiel> of course they are automatically qualified, do you know how many hands they had to grease to host the world cup?
[2022-12-22 10:38:33] <ColeHarts> Mid beast is daddy

[2022-12-22 12:48:34] <D12VEVO> for you, 100m probably
[2022-12-22 12:48:36] <kahzmalol> 25m+ gotta be death
[2022-12-22 12:48:37] <%FQER> you okay beans? odd question mate
[2022-12-22 12:48:39] <DIETTWEAK> 1,082 feet
[2022-12-22 12:48:39] <+Vinzl0r> 140 is world record i think
[2022-12-22 12:48:39] <+taalu13> 52m is the record
[2022-12-22 12:48:39] <hendryjwr> For example, Laso Schaller broke the record for the highest feet-first dive in 2015 when he jumped from 58.8 metres above water
[2022-12-22 12:48:39] <+insom__> onto concrete?
[2022-12-22 12:48:41] <+fabsmtz> Like 35 max
[2022-12-22 12:48:41] <xer47> Chatting
[2022-12-22 12:48:42] <FruitsaladOCE> 20m i think bones start to break
[2022-12-22 12:48:43] <DIETTWEAK> is the record
[2022-12-22 12:48:44] <SneakyCuboid354> definitely not scripting
[2022-12-22 12:48:44] <newaccountx999> 30 wouldn't kill you
[2022-12-22 12:48:46] <JossyJoestar> average person like 30 sure, but you can train for higher
[2022-12-22 12:48:47] <FruitsaladOCE> if you land wrong
[2022-12-22 12:48:51] <Kapuso24> around 50m is free jumping record i think
[2022-12-22 12:48:52] <MagpieZaychik> Can survive as long as you dont Belly Flop
[2022-12-22 12:48:54] <NEXTLEVELCHUNK> bro someone has fell out of a plane and survived
[2022-12-22 12:48:55] <xer47> @newaccountx999 Kappa
[2022-12-22 12:48:59] <DIETTWEAK> 1,082 feet is the record for highest dive
[2022-12-22 12:48:59] <hendryjwr> @midbeast  For example, Laso Schaller broke the record for the highest feet-first dive in 2015 when he jumped from 58.8 metres above water.
[2022-12-22 12:49:00] <+Wj9000> If you can break surface tension before you land you can go crazy high
[2022-12-22 12:49:01] <L_U_L_________> 55 to 90 feet
[2022-12-22 12:49:05] <sandpapercondoms> its a technique thing they point with their hands like a spear to move the water

[2022-12-22 12:49:15] <astrothebat> You have to land perfectly otherwise 30 is inevitable death
[2022-12-22 12:49:22] <meliodazx3> saw 52m as a pro
[2022-12-22 12:49:25] <dundersmeden> 52,4m record

[2022-12-22 12:49:53] <+taalu13> i fell out of a plane from 10,000 feet and landed head first on to concrete, all I had was a bit of a headache
[2022-12-22 12:49:54] <needwaterr> these are high and all but not as high as I am right now SeemsGood
[2022-12-22 12:50:06] <DIETTWEAK> i lied google was sending me diving but not the jumping kind
