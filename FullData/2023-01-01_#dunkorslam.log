' And God made the firmament and divided the  dnkThrow  s which were under the firmament from the  dnkThrow  s which were above the firmament. And it was so.

[2023-01-01 00:22:41] <%+toasty_burger> @ForceKnightOfNi this isn't even his longest run... one of his previous event runs was ~36 hours
[2023-01-01 00:22:42] <%juoffi> dunno about Letaalis sleep schedule but its 1:22 am in finland :D
[2023-01-01 00:22:49] <%engel_69> 64 is the new dunkbot 2.0?
[2023-01-01 00:23:07] <%$Nifty255> twolfram you can get 11 orbs just fine. It's just for some dumb reason, daily runs don't count it.
[2023-01-01 00:23:07] <%Mikemage> @twolfram something to do with also not getting the orb spell unlocks in dailies

[2023-01-01 00:23:36] <%Seaguard> Is it impossible for every daily, or just something specific about this daily?
[2023-01-01 00:23:38] <Mayerling> it seems like a consequence of the way daily runs kinda have stuff pre unlocked

[2023-01-01 00:24:13] <%Niddy_Tipples> i mean the main difference between the daily and a normal run, is that on the daily, all spells are already "unlocked" and available for pickup, even if you havent completed the corresponding milestone, so that may have something to do with it

[2023-01-01 00:24:18] <ceelochamp> is it better to roll with a black hole on the tele or cast manually?

[2023-01-01 00:24:47] <%+teh60> @ceelochamp chase likes having black hole on seperate wand so he doesnt  tele-bh-dig into poly

[2023-01-01 00:54:45] <%+FactoryUpgrade> if You have the 63 pillars and you have no 64 pillars, you got a problem Because if You have the 63 pillars and you have no 64 pillars, you got a problem building...wait a minute. You have the 63 pillars, and you have no 64th you got a problem building your 64th. You have the 63..you have the 63 pillars and you don't have the 64th or 65th, the 63rd, it is easier to build. So if you have the 63rd and you don't have the 64th, it is easier to build the 63 pillars.

[2023-01-01 01:03:38] <+esperath> if You have the 63 pillars and you have no 64 pillars, you got a problem Because if You have the 63 pillars and you have no 64 pillars, you got a problem building...wait a minute. You have the 63 pillars, and you have no 64th you got a problem building your 64th. You have the 63..you have the 63 jumper cables and you don't have the 64th or 65th, the 63rd, it is easier to build. So if you have the 63rd and you don't have the 64th, it is easier to build the 63 pillars.

[2023-01-01 01:59:26] <%q_z__> @twolfram it's risky because liquid vacuum field sucks the liquid particles into the center and then spits it out. He could get polyd from that

[2023-01-01 02:18:55] <Mrwrocks> People use long videos as a second monitor or sleep fuel - I think it's good for your stats to have long videos have good watchthrough too

[2023-01-01 02:22:09] <%Teh_Weltschmerz> there's alot of people from twitch who use a second youtube account to backup their vods in case twitch elbow drops them with a dmca
[2023-01-01 02:22:11] <Equ1no0x> They just wanted to record your sweet voice for posterity

[2023-01-01 02:23:15] <%MadderoftheFew> if he wants to upload vods, he needs to record his voice and gameplay audio on one channel, and set the ! and # commands on another non-recorded channel for DMCA

[2023-01-01 02:44:13] <%myndzi> proper pronunciation requires tonal acrobatics that i can't reproduce regularly

Me and the ukkos used to give you a hard time in school. Sorry you were just an easy target lol. I can see not much has changed. Remember Spark Bolt with trigger the spell you had a crush on? Yeah we're married now. I make over 200k a year and live in an essence vault. I guess some things never change huh loser? Nice catching up lol. Pathetic..

You have the 63 pillars, and you have no 64th you got a problem building your 64th. You have the 63..you have the 63 pillars and you don't have the 64th or 65th, the 63rd, it is easier to build. So if you have the 63rd and you don't have the 64th, it is easier to build the 63 pillars.

[2023-01-01 03:59:19] <%dillycattack> is there another achievement you can get to 64 pillars?

[2023-01-01 03:59:27] <%Omnipotent_0> @Letaali That might be just the kind of energy we need to jinx the win
[2023-01-01 03:59:27] <%UnknownForce> if You have the 63 pillars and you have no 64 pillars, you got a problem Because if You have the 63 pillars and you have no 64 pillars, you got a problem building...wait a minute. You have the 63 pillars, and you have no 64th you got a problem building your 64th. You have the 63..you have the 63 pillars and you don't have the 64th or 65th, the 63rd, it is easier to build. So if you have the 63rd and you don't have the 64th, it is easier to build the 63 pillars.
[2023-01-01 03:59:38] <%Letaali> the orbs don't give unlocks, the devs didn't want the orbs to unlock the spells so they only have hearts
[2023-01-01 03:59:42] <$generalmills66> chain spell with black holes is *chef's kiss*
[2023-01-01 03:59:42] <Dellyflo613> isn't it because the daily assumes you already got the orb before?
[2023-01-01 03:59:42] <%baehjer57> COPIUM

[2023-01-01 03:59:45] <%myndzi> if he finishes it out, there's one legitimate argument that it's a bet failure, and that's basically that it's an untested route and part of the bet is whether it works out or not
[2023-01-01 03:59:47] <%Letaali> and due to that limit, it also won't give that pillar
[2023-01-01 03:59:54] <+stalnakerz> so you're saying you didn't do your research properly before putting the bet in
[2023-01-01 04:00:02] <%+CoaxialFlutter> this is a no hit run too right?
[2023-01-01 04:00:05] <%SaTTeK90> its just unlucky and you have no impact on so why discuss.. you did it
[2023-01-01 04:00:07] <%+ailoops> unlock it in the savefile :)

[2023-01-01 04:00:10] <%myndzi> i wouldn't argue for that interpretation to be the one that we run with, though that's how i interpreted the bet
[2023-01-01 04:00:23] <%Letaali> can always pour lava on there to make sure it won't fly
[2023-01-01 04:00:24] <mmelloon> you could also just make the bet null and void. LUL no one loses but neither does anyone win
[2023-01-01 04:00:25] <alchemechanist> @Letaali was the goal to do the work, or get the reward? The stream title says "63 achievements", not "fulfilling the nominal requirements for 63 achievements" Kappa
[2023-01-01 04:00:59] <%JefFunk> !isbet
[2023-01-01 04:00:59] <%myndzi> in other words, what i bet on was not only "whether dunk wins" but "whether everything works out" too
[2023-01-01 04:01:01] <%$Wckdneer> @DunkOrSlam then why does the run say 63 pillar run if this is actually a 64 pillar run? are you trying to SCAMMED us?
[2023-01-01 04:01:04] <@%DunkBot> Bets are CLOSED. Run ongoing - Noita 64 Pillar Achievement Run Attempt 1 - started 1277m ago

[2023-01-01 04:01:18] <%Larandar> @DunkOrSlam IMO you do one of the "cheaty" poly win for a 64th pilar and it's a WIN, else it's a loose
[2023-01-01 04:01:22] <%myndzi> which i think is a fair interpretation, but in this case and for the reason it didn't work out, i wouldn't argue for it
[2023-01-01 04:01:24] <%AgroKragle> Juuuust missed it
[2023-01-01 04:01:28] <Noooiz> Now did the Lord say, "First thou startest thine Twitch stream. Then thou must count to 64. 64 shall be the number of the counting and the number of the counting shall be 64. 65 shalt thou not count, neither shalt thou count 63, excepting that thou then proceedeth to 64. 69 is right out. Once the number 64, being the number of the counting, be reached, then sweatst thou the Grand Sweat unto thine viewers, who, being equally sweaty in my sight, shall praise it."
[2023-01-01 04:01:36] <%+ailoops> waitwait wait… Maybe you get pacifist since you unlock a new world? 🤔

[2023-01-01 04:01:49] <%myndzi> i figured letaali had it covered and you would succeed

[2023-01-01 04:02:29] <%Letaali> yeah, you could call it a failure on my part not testing in daily mode

[2023-01-01 04:03:08] <%Larandar> @DunkOrSlam IMO you do one of the "cheaty" poly win for a 64th pilar and it's a WIN, else it's a loose
[2023-01-01 04:03:11] <%myndzi> @Dellyflo613 that's not the point i'm trying to make... the point is that any number of unexpected things could go wrong in a never-before-done complex 24 hour run the first time, it just so happened that the thing that went wrong was this thing

[2023-01-01 04:16:47] <%$Wckdneer> @DunkOrSlam I checked the replay, and for a SPLIT second you had a stain, and it instantly popped you. You were fine for a second or so it was slowely damaging you and out of nowhere for a frame it popped up a stain of some kind and BAM
[2023-01-01 04:16:50] BITS: Kaedenn_ (420)
[2023-01-01 04:16:50] <%+Kaedenn_> Cheer420 Apparently you got nuked by the ominous liquid for a brief instant, and the center of the sun is instant damage iirc
[2023-01-01 04:16:51] <%Letaali> @DunkOrSlam ok also super important to have kolmi loaded when you do the EoE for a sampo, so the fight starts. then you lead him to a sun

[2023-01-01 04:19:19] <%Omnipotent_0> @tapshell Wasn't really a full second but more so 1 frame. But it doesn't matter because 1 frame is all it takes :)
[2023-01-01 04:19:22] <%$Wckdneer> @DragonfaceX we knew this when he started, it was going to be around 24h

[2023-01-01 04:19:39] <%SaTTeK90> can someone explain how this happend at the sun? 500k to 1 hp dnkOhNo dnkHuh and 1 hp due to perks saved his ass?

[2023-01-01 04:19:48] <%$Wckdneer> @tapshell yeah I didn't know if it was actually 1 frame and people get upset if you say 1 frame and it's not, so I stuck with 'split second'
[2023-01-01 04:19:48] <%$sharkbaitbroohaha> inside sun is midas dmg right?
[2023-01-01 04:19:48] <%Letaali> nope

[2023-01-01 04:19:55] <%Letaali> the ng+ worlds won't have sampo either

[2023-01-01 04:20:34] <%myndzi> (if you happen to know)
[2023-01-01 04:20:34] <%Letaali> the game gets a tag from the first peaceful ending, prevents the sampo from spawning it seems
[2023-01-01 04:20:38] <%myndzi> ah
[2023-01-01 04:20:39] <%SectionTIC> Did saving grace save your ass back there?
[2023-01-01 04:20:43] <%myndzi> so it's because a peaceful ending happened

[2023-01-01 04:22:34] <%myndzi> or wait, "loading back in" as in chunk loading

[2023-01-01 04:22:51] <%myndzi> i'm guessing like 2-3 hours?
[2023-01-01 04:22:54] <%Omnipotent_0> @brbrmensch possibly extended another 5-60 mins
[2023-01-01 04:22:58] <%Letaali> they are most safe when inside the sun already

[2023-01-01 04:23:42] <%myndzi> no he means put as many stones in the sun as possible

[2023-01-01 06:07:32] <@^Nightbot> CITBs: The science of understanding, deconstructing, and reconstructing Bet Runs. However, Chase is not a master of video games. It is impossible for him to hold his desire to throw. If one wishes to obtain a CITB, one must vote correctly 7 times in a row. This is the law of Chase In The Banks™; the trophies of the Moist Mob. In accordance to this law, there is a taboo for Chase. During bets, looking at chat is strictly forbidden. For what could equal his wrath at everyone voting !no on TI Runs

[2023-01-01 06:09:53] <%$Wckdneer> if You have the 63 pillars and you don't have 64 pillars, you got a problem Because if You have the 63 pillars and you dont have 64 pillars, you got a problem building...wait a minute. You have the 63 pillars, and you don't have the 64th you got a problem building your 64th. You have the 63..you have the 63 pillars and you don't have the 64th or 65th, the 63rd, it is easier to build. So if you have the 63rd and you don't have the 64th, it is easier to build the 63 pillars.

You have the 63 pillars, and you don't have the 64th you got a problem building your 64th. You have the 63..you have the 63 pillars and you don't have the 64th or 65th, the 63rd, it is easier to build. So if you have the 63rd and you don't have the 64th, it is easier to build the 63 pillars.

[2023-01-01 06:47:16] <%myndzi> @Letaali this is such a nice conclusion to the big brain route
[2023-01-01 06:47:21] <MrKuluW> this is wild
[2023-01-01 06:47:22] <Bluecrack> golden shields?
[2023-01-01 06:47:23] <+Jonny_Heat> dev's didn't plan for 90% of the shit that goes on in noita LUL
[2023-01-01 06:47:23] <%+kevin_bee> anyone wanna give me the 5c version of what's going on here?
[2023-01-01 06:47:24] <Noooiz> the devs are enraged
[2023-01-01 06:47:27] <KgtheJerk> not just me lol
[2023-01-01 06:47:28] <Ninth_Settler> "i don't think devs planned for people to do this" describes pretty much the whole noita community
[2023-01-01 06:47:28] <%$AndrewKovnat> end the stream exactly at midnight
[2023-01-01 06:47:28] <%+Kaedenn_> the devs will come out of hiding and release a patch JUST to give you a statue
[2023-01-01 06:47:31] <%Omnipotent_0> So we're going to be at like 1604?
[2023-01-01 06:47:44] <%$Wckdneer> @DunkOrSlam would it also include the 'peaceful worlds'?
[2023-01-01 06:47:45] <%Mikemage> 11 orbs modCheck
[2023-01-01 06:47:45] <Mayerling> 1602 isn't it?

[2023-01-01 06:47:48] <%LetsSufferTogether> 'In 1 run' Kappa Has 3 wins Kappa
[2023-01-01 06:47:48] <%Loopyluke> this is what every noita run was intended to be like according to the devs
[2023-01-01 06:47:51] <Mayerling> 1599 +3?
[2023-01-01 06:47:51] <tksuwu> mr streamer can I remove my bet if this actually counts as 3 runs?
[2023-01-01 06:47:51] <ChooperTrooper> what's the progress chat
[2023-01-01 06:47:53] <%$Wckdneer> if so its like 1605
[2023-01-01 06:47:55] <%InfidelCastro1> I thought this was for 1600 wins. scammed
[2023-01-01 06:47:57] <%MadderoftheFew> @Mayerling it was a new file
[2023-01-01 06:47:58] <%555entropy> 26 hours strong
[2023-01-01 06:48:02] <%+FireBurd> going to ng+ dosnt count as a win?
[2023-01-01 06:48:03] <%Letaali> if turning the world to gold wasn't enough, we do it 3 times
[2023-01-01 06:48:03] <%wwwwebster> You’re the best “noob” player with 0 wins
[2023-01-01 06:48:03] <%$AndrewKovnat> @DunkOrSlam how much of your progress did you unlock

[2023-01-01 06:48:09] <%Letaali> just to be sure everyone is dead
[2023-01-01 06:48:12] <%volymic> @kevin_bee rng manipulation when using EoE to spawn chests that contain Sampos (the game end item), and locking in all the wins the game has to offer
[2023-01-01 06:48:18] <%ba_nanananananana> easy just mix gold with gold it will point you into the direction of gold
[2023-01-01 06:48:20] <%+Kaedenn_> @Belberith no need to die to lock it in
[2023-01-01 06:48:26] BITS: myndzi (100)

[2023-01-01 06:48:26] <%Omnipotent_0> uni100 So technically this is not for the 1600th win anymore. Scammed.

[2023-01-01 06:59:15] <%MadderoftheFew> @quinnisgreat42 you can get three EoE orbs in each ng+ loop. one from main world, one from any east, and one from any west. once you get one from east, you can't get any more from any east. same goes for west. same goes for every other orb.

You have the 63 pillars, and you don't have the 64th you got a problem building your 64th. You have the 63..you have the 63 pillars and you don't have the 64th or 65th, the 63rd, it is easier to build.
