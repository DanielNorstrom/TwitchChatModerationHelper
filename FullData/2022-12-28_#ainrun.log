[2022-12-28 09:06:45] <%BigPissser> so why do you dodge away from the thrust? you kick everytime but whiff due to bad spacing
[2022-12-28 09:06:51] <red_trochee> this is silly

[2022-12-28 09:08:06] <%$meuller91> maybe there is no right way of kicking malenia to death....
[2022-12-28 09:08:09] <%arksteyx> ICANT
[2022-12-28 09:08:11] <Noro_magret> maybe there is a reason she gravitates around 69% hp
[2022-12-28 09:08:25] <%BigPissser> if you dodge forward a little bit earlier than you'd think against the thrust, you do end up face-to-face with her for close-range punishes
[2022-12-28 09:08:56] <%arksteyx> she spams waterfowl so much its dumb
[2022-12-28 09:09:20] <%SpecCop> Hmmge
[2022-12-28 09:09:36] <%BigPissser> yeah i guess the ealry thrust dodge is a lil risky for this attempt. but if you die, i'd definately try to leqrn its timing it helps a lot

[2022-12-28 09:11:06] <%AnasSpamsMD> could it be the way you dodge the 3rd attack, it felt like you dodged more forward than to the side when she clips you
[2022-12-28 09:11:10] <%arksteyx> maybe roll back
[2022-12-28 09:11:39] VIEWERS: 357
[2022-12-28 09:11:41] <%arksteyx> so running back is the play?

[2022-12-28 09:11:46] <%BigPissser> @arksteyx rolling back is typically instant death

[2022-12-28 13:12:56] <%SophieDarling> I mean if you just ignore Godskin Noble in the duo fight, don't attack him at all, he remains uber passive so you can just loop Apostle over and over. Not the most interesting fight but definitely a strat <3
