[2023-01-07 06:21:03] <+Dopey0440> also did they say ur going to ranger school?
[2023-01-07 06:21:04] <%+BoySpook_> what happened
[2023-01-07 06:21:13] <2AFrenchToast> @chedzmgedz Yeah I know a lot of guys that are in. I’ll be giving them a call tomorrow

[2023-01-07 06:22:08] <2AFrenchToast> @dopey0440 No but a Op40 contract gives you a spot in Ranger school

[2023-01-07 06:22:23] <%$chedzmgedz> @2afrenchtoast also they’ll tell you they’ll give you a 50k bonus. 25k is payed up front, the other 25k is payed over the course of your full enlistment (6 years). So don’t let them lie to you, I’m just making numbers up but 50% upfront and 50% over the enlistment is what haplens

[2023-01-07 06:24:40] <%$chedzmgedz> @2afrenchtoast getting picked up for ranger is no joke. It’s not like BUDS where they take anyone with a pulse to see who can make it. Rangers can be selective depending on manning
[2023-01-07 06:24:42] <%+DYNAM1C_D> FYI if you can't see gameplay check Husk stream

[2023-01-07 06:25:30] <2AFrenchToast> @chedzmgedz very true. But a Op40 contract gets me a better chance to get into RASP
[2023-01-07 06:25:30] <%vastty_> i peaked when i was born
[2023-01-07 06:25:35] <%+Galacticowboy> did you know you can like smell colors bro?

[2023-01-07 06:26:13] <%sm0k3ydabear987> So when does the prediction close 😬
[2023-01-07 06:26:22] <%$chedzmgedz> @2afrenchtoast also I was in the Navy. But all the BUDS drop outs went to the ships to scrape paint. I’m pretty sure it’s the same for the army but you’d just be burning shit piles on deployments.

[2023-01-07 06:27:54] <2AFrenchToast> @chedzmgedz So with a Op40 IF I wash out (which I won’t) I just become a 11b or 11c
[2023-01-07 06:28:30] <+Dopey0440> n rangers wont pick u for selection till u have min 2 yrs
