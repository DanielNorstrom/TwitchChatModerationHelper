[2023-01-02 09:43:18] <!%CamilaBianchini> Can I ask for dating advice @redbeard
[2023-01-02 09:43:21] <%+fireflygrave> Bloodhoof brothers reunited
[2023-01-02 09:43:41] <forgotaboutbre> thats a pretty good call
[2023-01-02 09:43:50] <!%CamilaBianchini> Of course
[2023-01-02 09:43:55] <!%BlitzFreeman> apparently when ladies ask you to find a smexy man they mean YOU and not actually "go find me another man"
[2023-01-02 09:44:01] <!%BlitzFreeman> maybe
[2023-01-02 09:44:06] <!%BlitzFreeman> im still unclear

[2023-01-02 09:44:20] <!%BlitzFreeman> ur so right
[2023-01-02 09:44:28] <%stevethyme> I have dating advice, especially now at the start of the new year, be always mindful of the year when you date something, its easy to accidentally write 2022
[2023-01-02 09:44:33] <!%BlitzFreeman> such a simple philosophy
