[2022-12-26 15:05:52] <@%prawnofthedead> Uninterruptable Power Supply. If the power goes out or when you get a power surge it keeps your PC running for a bit so you have time to close everything etc before your PC shuts down

[2022-12-26 15:06:01] <%BonesOnly> Dev do you ask brit or fasffy to get stuff off the top shelf for you?

[2022-12-26 15:56:39] <%+UmbralLuna> Corn tortillas are seen as more authentic to Mexican dishes, corn has been a staple ingredient in Mexican cooking for thousands of years. Wheat, on the other hand, has only been around since the Spanish brought the crop with them when they arrived in the Americas.
