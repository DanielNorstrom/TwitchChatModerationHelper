[2022-12-25 09:49:54] BITS: Order_of_Dusk (5)
[2022-12-25 09:49:54] <%Order_of_Dusk> uni5 Testicular torsion occurs when the spermatic cord (from which the testicle is suspended) twists, cutting off the blood supply to the testicle. The most common symptom in children is sudden, severe testicular pain. The testicle may be higher than usual in the scrotum and vomiting may occur. In newborns, pain is often absent and instead the scrotum may become discolored or the testicle may disappear from its usual place. Most of those affected have no obvious prior underlying health problems.

[2022-12-25 13:49:39] <%Lokiharth> @lexi_icefox there are ultimate guns for each gun type, but Wayne's 10 slot pistol for example you can get it way before, and given the range of mods and the fact you can upgrade all stats to 999 , ''best gun'' gets hard pick, but I'd say pistols are your best choice since they have no weakness, but also no strenghts other than what you give

[2022-12-25 14:01:52] <sparkster967> I think adobo mixed with the cocaine might be particularly toxic. But maybe it's safe for onis.
[2022-12-25 14:01:53] <!%+ChillPillVT> Seems pretty handy that you actually get to pick your target instead of it being random like the other one, yeah?
[2022-12-25 14:02:12] <!%+ChillPillVT> i like his blue shirt. it's nice.
[2022-12-25 14:02:31] <%Nikuzaka> its on the 13th floor but I think its time you needed to go?
