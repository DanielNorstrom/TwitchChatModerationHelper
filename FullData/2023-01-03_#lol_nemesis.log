[2023-01-03 17:40:23] <Felanbird> cuz the fix is super funny
[2023-01-03 17:40:48] <Felanbird> oh xdg utils worked damn
[2023-01-03 17:41:07] <!%j0sh1g4> i had to add my windows browser to the thing also
[2023-01-03 17:41:10] <!%j0sh1g4> okay so

[2023-01-03 17:41:28] <!%j0sh1g4> like
[2023-01-03 17:41:31] <!%j0sh1g4> how do i explain this
[2023-01-03 17:41:39] <!%j0sh1g4> the frames bleed together

[2023-01-03 17:42:15] <Felanbird> hmmm
[2023-01-03 17:42:31] <Felanbird> i wonder if that's just a vm issue
[2023-01-03 17:42:39] <!%j0sh1g4> could be
[2023-01-03 17:42:44] <Felanbird> cuz i'm SURE if that happened consistantly we would have heard about it
[2023-01-03 17:42:52] <!%j0sh1g4> are bttv 7tv ffz all the same format?
[2023-01-03 17:42:58] <!%j0sh1g4> then it would be rly weird
[2023-01-03 17:43:15] <!%j0sh1g4> Hmm the logs
[2023-01-03 17:43:25] <!%j0sh1g4> 7tv are called .webp
[2023-01-03 17:43:30] <!%j0sh1g4> other have no extension
[2023-01-03 17:43:33] <Felanbird> 7tv uses webp's ye
[2023-01-03 17:43:37] <Felanbird> other ones are gifs
[2023-01-03 17:43:58] <!%j0sh1g4> so my vm cant show webp correctly
[2023-01-03 17:44:02] <!%j0sh1g4> sounds like the issue
[2023-01-03 17:44:06] <Felanbird> i'd say likely ye
[2023-01-03 17:44:18] <Felanbird> cuz we have the depencancy that lets u see them at all
[2023-01-03 17:44:25] <Felanbird> which is the image plugins one

[2023-01-03 17:50:40] <Felanbird> ya whatever depenancy is called image plugins
[2023-01-03 17:50:44] <!%j0sh1g4> qt5-image-formats-plugins maybe
[2023-01-03 17:50:46] <Felanbird> yeah that
[2023-01-03 17:51:03] <Felanbird> it has a different name on arch/ubuntu/fedora

[2023-01-03 17:56:19] <!%j0sh1g4> seems like nobody in the world has this issue
[2023-01-03 17:57:07] <Felanbird> I remember during the animated PFP testing troy saw the pfp's bleeding on a vm
[2023-01-03 17:57:31] <!%j0sh1g4> what format are pfp
[2023-01-03 17:57:49] <Felanbird> probably webp's too they love their webp's over there
[2023-01-03 17:58:02] <Felanbird> u'd have to boot up chatterino7 tho
[2023-01-03 17:58:25] <Felanbird> it also might not be the same issue, because they blamed qt 5.12.12 for the problem
[2023-01-03 17:58:39] <!%j0sh1g4> Hmm
[2023-01-03 17:59:09] <!%j0sh1g4> ok i found the solution
[2023-01-03 17:59:19] <!%j0sh1g4> make 7tv use different format
[2023-01-03 17:59:21] <!%j0sh1g4> pepegeHmm
[2023-01-03 17:59:47] <Felanbird> you could append .gif to the end of every 7tv emote u load
[2023-01-03 17:59:55] <Felanbird> im pretty sure that's valid on their end
[2023-01-03 17:59:59] <Felanbird> and loads the gif instead
[2023-01-03 18:00:16] <!%j0sh1g4> but
[2023-01-03 18:00:23] <!%j0sh1g4> is there a gif?

[2023-01-03 19:06:52] <!%j0sh1g4> qbaumi2004
[2023-01-03 19:09:02] <!%j0sh1g4> does chatterino save the emotes to somewhere?
[2023-01-03 19:10:00] <%qbaumi2004> ?
[2023-01-03 19:10:05] <%qbaumi2004> which emotes
[2023-01-03 19:10:51] <%qbaumi2004> let me read everything real quick
[2023-01-03 19:10:56] <!%j0sh1g4> yea go read
[2023-01-03 19:13:24] <%qbaumi2004> @j0sh1g4 I think changing wepb to gif does not work
[2023-01-03 19:13:27] <%qbaumi2004> If I recall correctly
[2023-01-03 19:13:47] <!%j0sh1g4> so whats the solution
[2023-01-03 19:14:03] <!%j0sh1g4> i mean it kinda works
[2023-01-03 19:14:05] <%qbaumi2004> so the problem is that you cant display webp properly right=

[2023-01-03 19:14:28] <%qbaumi2004> wepb is a new and currently I think the best format for images/animated images
[2023-01-03 19:14:34] <%qbaumi2004> it just sucks tho
[2023-01-03 19:14:37] <%qbaumi2004> no
[2023-01-03 19:14:40] <%qbaumi2004> but I don't like it
[2023-01-03 19:14:43] <%qbaumi2004> because discord doesnt like it
[2023-01-03 19:15:06] <%qbaumi2004> I don't think your solution is to change all the wepb to gif
[2023-01-03 19:15:12] <!%j0sh1g4> Clueless
