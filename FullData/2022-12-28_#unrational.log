[2022-12-28 07:52:46] <%+helldelta99> @robbyreyn10 Want to‚Ä¶ get to know people? Me personally, I actually do like talking to people and getting to know them, despite being pretty introverted. In the bars I‚Äôve worked at, they‚Äôre typically some pretty influential and wealthy people. So I not only enjoy it but also think it‚Äôs nice being on the good side of people like that. But in my experience, at higher-volume bars, they‚Äôre there for the tip and not much else.
