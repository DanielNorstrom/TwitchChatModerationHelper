[2022-12-29 10:35:55] <@%Breakspear> Yeah
[2022-12-29 10:35:58] <%Cartster> a lot
[2022-12-29 10:36:02] <%thirty3baboons> stupid money :)
[2022-12-29 10:36:04] <%LiamG> you're smart. just bung break a £30 dono, it'll probably be cheaper

[2022-12-29 10:36:11] <%Cartster> 3080ti about 900?
[2022-12-29 10:36:14] <%+Tomshepmx> because its good reviews and half the price

[2022-12-29 10:36:18] <Niko_sito> nope, intel mid tier
[2022-12-29 10:36:20] <bEn_Ja_m1N> when it comes to last gen, i'd just go with AMD if you dont care about RT or DLSS
[2022-12-29 10:36:20] <@%sRede> overpriced, that's why it's at 20 year low for sales
[2022-12-29 10:36:20] <%Lemings> New intel is good for new games, but it struggles with older DX versions
[2022-12-29 10:36:26] <@%Breakspear> @svekky can't get one until I can get a 3080 in stock

[2022-12-29 10:57:36] <%LiamG> @Breakspear you probably should stop listening to tutorial podcasts while you're doing it then
[2022-12-29 10:57:44] <%$CMDR_WeeJet> one time I want to see a streamer ban people who don't backseat. that would be a meme
[2022-12-29 10:57:58] <@%Breakspear> @LiamG It's the live audience mainly
[2022-12-29 10:58:00] <octavian1981> backseating can be dfistracting the streamer ... u might be focused on something and all of a sudden somebody says: " oh by the way, go there, do that" and while u'r reading you might get killed

[2022-12-29 16:55:28] <@%Breakspear> That's also nurses who are at the top of their banding. They start at around £27k. @LiamDubheadScott
[2022-12-29 16:55:32] <%svekky> it's modaal income here
[2022-12-29 16:55:39] <+ItsSynister> My sister is a nurse and striking currently, she said it's not about the money. It's about the lack of nurses; which is due to the low wage.
[2022-12-29 16:55:39] <%Finaija> @JimothyM3 thing with families is, they tend to have 2 people bringing in money. Sure, not when baba is new, but...
[2022-12-29 16:55:41] <%LiamDubheadScott> @jimothym3 i provately rent which is more than mortgage payments and have a family to support, i dont earn 35 and between me and my partner we dont earn 40, we live comfortably

[2022-12-29 16:55:55] <%Josh_93_> @LiamDubheadScott I grew up the same, my whole family has always worked. £35k for what they do isn't a decent wage

[2022-12-29 16:56:08] <%LiamDubheadScott> @breakspear again, the figures i were looking at stated the Uk average is just a tiny bit under 35k
[2022-12-29 16:56:15] <+joeoshock> @liamdubheadscott Nurses getting more money for their work doesn’t mean you also shouldn’t get more money… this is the problem.. people argue against those that strike because they can’t strike themselves.. not saying you are doing that.. but wages aren’t a zero sum game.. others don\t have to suffer for you to succeed
[2022-12-29 16:56:31] <+spardha> @kbgarcia17 been awhile since ive been to the US but I would say, you guys seemed to have more disposible income.

[2022-12-29 17:56:59] <%Mykl3> The audio is also wayyy better with Binaural activated
[2022-12-29 17:56:59] <%Cartster> @WildlandsTom it's due to the CPU doing the maths
[2022-12-29 17:57:05] <%$Funk_Diggiddy> Cause even after being in a playable state for nearly 7 years, the game still isn't optimized for shit
[2022-12-29 17:57:14] <%WildlandsTom> fair enough

[2022-12-29 20:10:19] <@%rockshiv> well, idk. When I've done rougher work, snot tends to be full of it. Maybe it would get into your system more without the hairs
[2022-12-29 20:10:22] <%$Mercenary_Wolf> Gotta wax your nose then snort massive lines
[2022-12-29 20:10:24] <cookingfat> Nose hairs act as a filter that prevents dust, pollen, and allergens from entering your lungs. When particles enter your nose, they get stuck on a thin layer of mucus that coats your hairs. Eventually, the particles either get sneezed out or swallowed. Your nose is also filled with microscopic hairs called cilia
