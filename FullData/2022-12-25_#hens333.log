[2022-12-25 15:28:40] <toooth> was that auto aim or what, how did he miss the swing
[2022-12-25 15:28:40] <%zeenotix> he has a 3 gen I think
[2022-12-25 15:28:42] <ballsniffer90> @TheShape76  I use tombstone piece and some times tombstone bc it just seems very op and I keep winning with the perks
[2022-12-25 15:28:53] <OhItsNoctu> @Commander_Cornflakes can be good imo, depends on the other perks in your build

[2022-12-25 16:22:41] <%zeenotix> they need to rework collision on this map badly
[2022-12-25 16:22:43] <TestSubject_35> lets face it their hasnt been a good map for a looong time now
[2022-12-25 16:22:48] <OhItsNoctu> i hate the color scheme, it's okay to play but i don't wanna look at it tbh
[2022-12-25 16:22:56] <tornhonor> Some maps are way too big
[2022-12-25 16:22:59] <%AMGC7> it has a couple bugged structures and too big still, if they fix those 2 things I think it can be a really nice map
[2022-12-25 16:23:03] <ninjadragon21345> this map is bad, its just less evil then the other 2
[2022-12-25 16:23:17] <TestSubject_35> wonder if this map is bigger than mothers dwelling
[2022-12-25 16:23:26] <UncleStanBana> i wish the maps were blue again like Macmillan Sadge
[2022-12-25 16:23:31] <EnvyOffline> as someone who is a bit colorblind, this map hurts to look at lol, everything kinda blends really hard

[2022-12-25 16:24:51] <TestSubject_35> maybe it just feels bigger because of all the clutter you have to navigate around
[2022-12-25 16:24:57] <SchokomokoTTV> this map is something different, not the best, sure, but a welcome change from time to time
[2022-12-25 16:25:16] <OhItsNoctu> @EnvyOffline yeah you could try reshade in case you're only like red colorblind for example

[2022-12-25 16:57:28] <Anananananas> lery's is not too bad for oni
[2022-12-25 16:57:31] <%sam_vilderness> @TestSubject_35 i think mandatory addons are fine, but i might be coping. i play too much with them
[2022-12-25 16:57:32] <%+HansGetTheFLammenwerfer> trapper should be able to find a rocketlauncher if he gets send to erie
[2022-12-25 16:57:41] <%knifola> @UncleStanBana ill go even further and say that the BP system itself is outdated
[2022-12-25 16:57:50] <0000x0000y> I personally think it's lery's
[2022-12-25 16:57:58] <%+ForestGrandpa> she went outside

[2022-12-25 16:58:01] <%A2Zephyr> @TestSubject_35 addons aren't mandatory to play, i kinda get what you mean but im still a bit weary idk why i dislike the argument

[2022-12-25 17:00:41] <%sam_vilderness> lery's is pretty bad for the oni flicks
[2022-12-25 17:00:51] <TestSubject_35> @TestSubject_35 I feel ya. I think it might just be the disparity between killers and their different addons, where some killers are just good without addons and others really rely on them

[2022-12-25 17:16:35] <%AcOlYtE_oF_sEeR> funnily enough deception works in an amusing fashion with plagues infectio...if you deception a locker it gets infected as if the survivor is inside it...and since deception now removes pools of blood along with marks, round the corner and plagues often stay and open the empty locker kek hensComfy

[2022-12-25 17:22:34] <%AcOlYtE_oF_sEeR> @egyptian_king_194 I like being chased...hags very often just slap and go back to defending their stuff...which is fair it's hag but it's kinda boring in the long run
[2022-12-25 17:22:38] <icemoo0> @AcOlYtE_oF_sEeR The thing about hag is that a good hag on a good map is fucking painful but its so boring to play so nobody plays her. Nurse is at least fun for the nurse player
[2022-12-25 17:22:43] <%+DerKoaLa22> Dwight has the most drip tho LUL
[2022-12-25 17:22:44] <%ObsidianLiger> I think zarina has the best perk

[2022-12-25 17:23:26] <doombuggy12> @reco_st nea's perks are not designed for looping, urban evasion is her main perk and thst is to avoid chase
[2022-12-25 17:23:31] <Phadey> @celiaa_14 prove thyself is for gens, leader is for pretty much everything other than gens
[2022-12-25 17:23:40] <celiaa_14> oh thanks guys! i was confused about that

[2022-12-25 17:52:39] <%+DerKoaLa22> @TickTackBoooom I didn't say the blight needs it be good, I said he needs to be used to the turnrate. Meaning there are blights who only play AV. And in my opinion the 1 second recovery rate of the Tokens are waay to strong. I mean you need 7 seconds to get all your 7 rushes back. And even with the small Turnrate, with bumplogic you almost always get a hit

[2022-12-25 18:01:36] <%+DerKoaLa22> @TickTackBoooom Okay but no Addon is really "op", if the Blight isnt playing well with it lol? For alc ring you need hits as well xD Im not talking about hug tech at all. Bump logic means using your surrounding as a blight to secure a hit. And thats not an issue, thats a way of playing the killer. And considering the distance after a hit, yeah of course you can still make distance. But basekit 10 sec for 5 rushes and AV 7 sec for 7 rushes (plus 10% speed) just seems to be too much of an upside
[2022-12-25 18:01:39] <+TheArctosJackal> @KausarAhmed Its more a conditioning thing, play without it more and maybe you get used too it? Idk

[2022-12-25 18:26:18] <%+DerKoaLa22> @TickTackBoooom Thats a good question actually. I dont really like playing with it, but i know a few Blight players who literally got "addicted" to AV and they are not used to the basekit anymore xD But yeah, a good blight probably can play every addon in a good way imo

[2022-12-25 18:26:42] <%+TickTackBoooom> @DerKoaLa22 hmm i think sth being very strong only becomes a problem when its also very easy to use right? like nurse i dont mind being destroyed by very good player

[2022-12-25 18:29:29] <%+DerKoaLa22> @TickTackBoooom Generally yes, if sth is easy to use and strong at the same time, it can be dangerous for the game. (Looking over the fact that you have to learn how to play blight in the first place). But i actually dont mind playing against an "bad" blight with alc ring, the good ones are the ones that make it even more oppressing u know?
[2022-12-25 18:29:29] <%BuccaneerStinkyButt> @Ana1661 its referencing some clip of john cena talking about ice cream and fast and furious movies in fluent chinese just so you know. Meme was funny but again idk if we should normalize copy pastas like that probably good you deleted it

[2022-12-25 18:41:32] <%+DerKoaLa22> @TickTackBoooom Yeahh well even i as a blight main agree on that point. Alc ring is definetly too strong, no question. (Even tho its really fun to play) Maybe it only should recover half of the tokens or sth like that.  My "concern" only was the fact that i would put AV on the same tier as double speed, maybe even higher.

[2022-12-25 19:45:53] <Loudmuch> feng is a good n00b survivor, alert is handy at all ranks

[2022-12-25 19:46:09] <gyalocer792> Alert is really good
[2022-12-25 19:46:13] <%CptCrunch_> @loudmuch and Lithe is a solid perk aswell
[2022-12-25 19:46:17] <j0nathanGaming> The other originals are technically free
[2022-12-25 19:46:21] <juannyx2> Alert is crazy strong to be honest
[2022-12-25 19:46:27] <wulvazttv> Hey
[2022-12-25 19:46:28] <%+Steve8K> Meg is the best (: Thankfully she's free lirikWINK
[2022-12-25 19:46:37] <%+xploitr13> STBFL <3
[2022-12-25 19:46:45] <j0nathanGaming> Jeff for Distortion is top notch
[2022-12-25 19:46:49] <Loudmuch> @CptCrunch_ I agree! Prob the easiest of the exhaustions to understand
[2022-12-25 19:46:50] <adept_gopnik> Feng is good for new players
[2022-12-25 19:46:54] <j0nathanGaming> Ever since nowhere to hide became a perk, I just constantly run distortion
[2022-12-25 19:47:00] <Just_FrankZ> kate for windows i love windows :D
[2022-12-25 19:47:02] <wulvazttv> Merry Christmas to you @hens333 wulvazLv

[2022-12-25 19:47:17] <%+mig_rattlehead> I hecking love distortion
[2022-12-25 19:47:19] <%CptCrunch_> @loudmuch Precisely. peepoHappy Feng and Kate are great first survivors for starters
[2022-12-25 19:47:26] <juannyx2> @j0nathanGaming can't get NTH value if you always pre-run Keepo
[2022-12-25 19:47:32] <j0nathanGaming> Jeff's perks are quite nice actually, at least my play style
[2022-12-25 19:47:39] <adept_gopnik> Adam for Pebble
[2022-12-25 19:47:47] <j0nathanGaming> @juannyx2 you got me there, but I can also call out "Yo he has Lethal (or insert other aura perk)
[2022-12-25 19:47:52] <+violetmoons856> I love pebble gaming
[2022-12-25 19:47:52] <gyalocer792> What‚Äôs the survivor called that can store generator progress for later
[2022-12-25 19:47:53] <ChristopherMino> I do enjoy some good balanced landing.
[2022-12-25 19:48:07] <%+mig_rattlehead> @gyalocer792 Vittorio
[2022-12-25 19:48:10] <%+Steve8K> Merry Sacrifices NODDERS
[2022-12-25 19:48:12] <Loudmuch> booo boons
[2022-12-25 19:48:13] <j0nathanGaming> Autodidact is the best worst perk in the game
[2022-12-25 19:48:15] <MergosWetNurse> i said it
[2022-12-25 19:48:21] <MonsterKillxDD> boons sofareksKsBald
[2022-12-25 19:48:21] <j0nathanGaming> No one like Mikaela
[2022-12-25 19:48:21] <%Pandom__> No one wants to encourage people to use Circle :tf:
[2022-12-25 19:48:22] <duk_was_taken> fuck coh
[2022-12-25 19:48:22] <gyalocer792> @mig_rattlehead Is he goof
[2022-12-25 19:48:23] <wulvazttv> wulvazGg
[2022-12-25 19:48:23] <+violetmoons856> Her other perks are sorta trash tho
[2022-12-25 19:48:24] <Leukodystrophy> Cause no one wants to see more CoH
[2022-12-25 19:48:30] <%+ElitusEnt> trapper is too good
[2022-12-25 19:48:34] <%+xploitr13> Strong Evan
[2022-12-25 19:48:34] <juannyx2> I dont like to recommend COH to new players because its not a healthy perk to crutch on
[2022-12-25 19:48:41] <gyalocer792> Kate Denson Is Good
[2022-12-25 19:48:43] <%+dponly15> He has Lithe and Balanced
[2022-12-25 19:48:49] <duk_was_taken> no COH user or Mikaela is getting hatch
[2022-12-25 19:48:50] <%+mig_rattlehead> @gyalocer792 i like fog wise, other perks are meh
[2022-12-25 19:48:52] <adept_gopnik> yeah, kate is a good answer
[2022-12-25 19:48:57] <ahomelessmannamedfred> @juannyx2 players who boon in really bad situations are the worst lol
[2022-12-25 19:49:00] <%+Steve8K> Trapper OP Kappa
[2022-12-25 19:49:00] <j0nathanGaming> My problem with Mikaela is that they always seem to prioritize boons over teammates. Perks are good yeah, but the steyrotype of a Mikaela blessing totems is too strong
