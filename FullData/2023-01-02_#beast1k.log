[2023-01-02 12:00:31] <%Redvid1> @lnsomniker that miswalker jacket kinda senna on steroid tho since u dont take damage when u use it
[2023-01-02 12:00:53] <+lnsomniker> @Redvid1 true, but alot of league abilities would be broken in albion, and vice versa... \
[2023-01-02 12:00:54] <%Redvid1> but otherwise it would be usseles
[2023-01-02 12:01:25] <%Redvid1> i already think mistwalker jacket is a little bit to much in some contents
