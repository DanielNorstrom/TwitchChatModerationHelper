[2023-01-10 03:35:08] <@%+sanguine00> hmm i only take an edible once per week because i'm scared it will start to lose its affect on me
[2023-01-10 03:35:10] <+LividCreature> @iblance the carts are nasty
[2023-01-10 03:35:13] <@%+skizem_> You can grow up to 4 plants here legally, I haven't paid for weed in a long time
[2023-01-10 03:35:21] <bigc4_25> Wax users actually fuckin scare me
[2023-01-10 03:35:25] <%stevethekind> @sanguine00 you sound like a quitter
[2023-01-10 03:35:26] <%namorsei> god I wish @skizem_
[2023-01-10 03:35:27] <CameIYogurt> @th3_b3hold3r sounds like you need to take more time for yourself more often my dude. you sound overworked
[2023-01-10 03:35:31] <sirbentley071> Edibles are dangerous. Once you eat an edible skittle you can stop because you think it’s just a regular bag
[2023-01-10 03:35:32] <%$no1fx> @skizem_ nothing better man!!
[2023-01-10 03:35:35] <%stevethekind> one per week will keep you productive... and you have a job.. so stay that way
[2023-01-10 03:35:44] <@%+skizem_> @namorsei It's a fun hobby!
[2023-01-10 03:35:44] <th3_b3hold3r> @CameIYogurt Bad anxiety will do it.
[2023-01-10 03:35:45] <+LividCreature> @NicotineMachine ironically, I quit nicotine on the 1st
[2023-01-10 03:35:47] <@%+skizem_> @no1fx Right?!
[2023-01-10 03:36:01] <%fuzzycurtis> had to quit doing dabs, shit is just straight to the 'way too zoned' territory
[2023-01-10 03:36:01] <CameIYogurt> @th3_b3hold3r yea i understand it man
[2023-01-10 03:36:02] <%namorsei> I bet it is I've seen so many rigs and they look so fun to take care of and work on @skizem_
[2023-01-10 03:36:05] <%stevethekind> ehh..
[2023-01-10 03:36:07] <+iblance> it was to the point where joints didn't make me high anymore
[2023-01-10 03:36:09] <+Dusti_n> @sanguine00 i've had daily edibles. I take a few days break and it all comes back.
[2023-01-10 03:36:10] <NicotineMachine> @LividCreature I actually wish i could quit smoking... =(

[2023-01-10 03:36:28] <%namorsei> widepeepoHappy that's awesome
[2023-01-10 03:36:28] <%stevethekind> weed will keep you from vaping/drinking as long as youre quick to find your even ground
[2023-01-10 03:36:30] <%redbeardsteve1> I tried a delta 8 gummy a while back.  My cheeks felt like they were falling off and I fell asleep.
[2023-01-10 03:36:33] <@%+sanguine00> @stevethekind Yeah I agree. I also don't want to be in a constant fog so once per week is good. maybe twice over a long weekend
[2023-01-10 03:36:33] <%Forsaken_U> smoking a blunt rn
[2023-01-10 03:36:35] <bigc4_25> @fuzzycurtis it makes no sense to murder yourself to the point of comatose on the first hit KEKW
[2023-01-10 03:36:40] <+LividCreature> @NicotineMachine I quit smoking years ago, picked up the vapage for many years... needed to be done with it

[2023-01-10 03:37:31] <benfucito> weed is great for nausea, insta cure for car sickness

[2023-01-10 03:49:51] <%fleeting2020> I hate when someone gets raided and they have an annoying follow alert.  I instantly tune out.   Raid wasted.
[2023-01-10 03:49:59] <%SourSweet> what, the alerts where someone can pay a certain amount of bits to play a sound that they choose on stream?
[2023-01-10 03:50:10] <%Forsaken_U> follower alerts are the worst
[2023-01-10 03:50:19] <%riverswrath27> Dellor makes a living at 5 dollar a pop for being verbally abused……it’s unbelievable.
[2023-01-10 03:50:20] <DrummerxDan> It's bad when they're set to channel points. Then it gets spammed

[2023-01-10 03:50:40] <reallytired_> worst is when streamers ask for like 130000 channel points to say something out loud
[2023-01-10 03:50:40] <CameIYogurt> the worst are when its a stream thats super chill and quiet but it has the loudest sound alerts which totally interupt the vibe of the stream
[2023-01-10 03:50:42] <%Zenonoke> @Ceremor fake mosin shots and bloodsucker sounds are funny if they are really relly RARE ... no???

[2023-01-10 08:59:00] <%sparr_w> @sparr_w it'd be cool if a lot of it wasn't bugged, for example the lubjansk log cabin which if you lock the front door u cannot hit it to break it open
[2023-01-10 08:59:07] <%davidq1103> Can easily combo stun lock with a jump

[2023-01-10 09:01:07] <%sparr_w> so how does this heavy attack not use stamina work? do you have an idea on how to trigger it?

[2023-01-10 09:03:34] <FR_ERA> broke
[2023-01-10 09:03:42] <%sparr_w> perhaps the stamina is taken away at the end of the attack or something
[2023-01-10 09:03:55] <%sparr_w> and something happens to cancel the ending but the damage still delivers
[2023-01-10 09:04:11] <+nwolclown> @Makimanz regular has cars, lighter temps, bases and brighter nights. hardcore does not have these

[2023-01-10 09:57:43] <+mindsbro> if there was mounds dedicated to hiding rather than terrain errors that sounds neat

[2023-01-10 11:11:44] <%Psychoactivehaze> only gotta be right once every 2-3 hours at these odds, average life expectancy is lower than that, even in the south. only time I'd not say is if teamed with someone solid
