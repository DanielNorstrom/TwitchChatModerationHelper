[2022-12-10 00:29:49] <%toonbeastie> 90's xmen comics were the best
[2022-12-10 00:29:54] <%ItsDemonJD> @ShamWOW36 my fav super hero movie.  I bought the box set even
[2022-12-10 00:30:14] <+V1cariousx> Black Panther got the biggest boost by the MCU
[2022-12-10 00:30:14] <%ItsDemonJD> might watch logan while i clean lol

[2022-12-10 00:30:23] <@%+Anubis169> Black Widow... honestly i thought having Black Widow's past as just the couple of scenes in Avengers and Age of Ultron, was perfect
[2022-12-10 00:30:25] <%+ShamWOW36> @ShamWOW36 that movie had me in tears multiple times, Patrick Stewart and Hugh Jackman have great chemistry
[2022-12-10 00:30:26] <@%+Anubis169> it kept the mystery going
[2022-12-10 00:30:27] <mirukuu> Gna - the wutang valkyrie
[2022-12-10 00:30:33] <%+MikeAlight> Tokyo Vice is fantastic! Highly recommended! Can't wait for next season.
[2022-12-10 00:30:37] <%+ShamWOW36> DEADPOOL manGRY manGRY
[2022-12-10 00:30:40] <CopenhagenCool> Tokyo Vice was great, enjoyed that
[2022-12-10 00:31:04] <ghostyzerocool> apparently kratos is mcu now. due to the guardians holiday special... also batman lol
[2022-12-10 00:31:05] <%RyChus> Tokyo Vice was awesome, fingers crossed for season 2
[2022-12-10 00:31:08] <+Jintu> Logan is the best Marvel movie I have seen yet
[2022-12-10 00:31:13] <@%+Anubis169> going abstract for a sec, also i think how Disney screwed ScarJo over on release was underhanded
[2022-12-10 00:31:18] <mirukuu> episode 8 of chainsaw man is legendary.  so emotional and dynamic
[2022-12-10 00:31:23] <%ultimademon> I have such a hard time getting into doom patrol
[2022-12-10 00:31:30] <%Zerotan> How'd you feel about Invincible?
[2022-12-10 00:31:44] <%+ShamWOW36> Deadpool 2 for me was so rewatchable cause i'm biased with Juggernaut, i love that guy LUL
[2022-12-10 00:32:00] <%RyChus> good for her
[2022-12-10 00:32:08] <Cinnam> The whole first run of Chainsaw Man is epic, plenty more material for the

[2022-12-10 00:32:34] <%TOBerserk> Not bacause they lost 1.5 billion in the last quarter on Disney+?
[2022-12-10 00:32:38] <+Noshpan> I am also enjoying watching Chainsaw Man
[2022-12-10 00:32:42] <BlG_B0SS_> this would be so much more easier if they didn't have this little load screen
[2022-12-10 00:33:00] <%+yellgler> I'm really hoping insomniac nail their wolverine game. although I'm pretty sure it'll be teen rated which mean it won't be dark enough for my tastes lol
[2022-12-10 00:33:00] <%+noobiablos> Chainsaw really had it's "Ballad of Fallen Angels" moment with episodes 8 and 9. I'm all aboard this crazy train.
[2022-12-10 00:33:01] <%ultimademon> how long is chainsaw man?
[2022-12-10 00:33:10] <%ultimademon> i keep having it recommended

[2022-12-10 00:34:21] <Cinnam> I don't think it is a spoiler but I read all of Chainsaw Man and didn't notice it was set in the 90s

[2022-12-10 00:34:30] <%+ShamWOW36> my love for Ryan Reynolds came from that movie "Just Friends" that movie is so funny
[2022-12-10 00:34:37] <+Noshpan> @ultimademon The anime isn't very long at the moment, but I recommend it.
[2022-12-10 00:35:03] <wonderland_gaming> reynolds got respect when killing themself as green lantern
[2022-12-10 00:35:05] <%sunny_snow> kind of want them to continue with the x 23 story
[2022-12-10 00:35:26] <@%+Anubis169> ShamWOW36: mine came from that movie where he's that psycho killer who talks to his cat and dog
[2022-12-10 00:35:28] <%Zerotan> For Nilfheim!
[2022-12-10 00:35:28] <mirukuu> They really nailed the neck rolls on Kratos in this one
[2022-12-10 00:35:29] <@%+Anubis169> and the cat and dog talk back
[2022-12-10 00:35:48] <@%Majeye> I've loved Ryan Reynolds starting from the movie "Waiting..."
[2022-12-10 00:35:53] <+Noshpan> I'm a bit sad that Golden Kamuy has been put on indefinate hiatus due to a highly valuable staff member of the studio passing away

[2022-12-10 01:12:38] <@%MANdroid> Rule #2 - No spoilers. This includes asking questions like, "Has MAN fought [name] boss yet?" They are leading, and lead to spoilers if MAN hasn't done that yet.

Any questions MAN asks are him thinking aloud, not asking for advice. If MAN actually wants advice, he will make it VERY clear.

[2022-12-10 01:13:48] <@%MANdroid> Rule #4 - Don't backseat life. MAN is a big boy and knows when he needs to take a break, get some food, etc.

[2022-12-10 01:21:28] <@%MANdroid> Rule #1 - NO BACKSEAT GAMING! This means tips, hints on what is currently or about to happen, guesses, or suggestions on what to do in the game. Any questions MAN asks are him thinking aloud, not asking for advice. If MAN actually wants advice, he will make it VERY clear.
