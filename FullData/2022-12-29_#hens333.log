[2022-12-29 15:11:14] <Alexagon> Maybe example of macro will be: doing proper gens to prevent tri-gen. Playing every pallet without waste and use them without creating deadzones?

[2022-12-29 15:23:32] <%Cairsoir> I'ma be real, if person is competetive I'd 100% recommend playing something like LoL or Dota2 over DBD, at least those games resemble balance

[2022-12-29 15:23:42] <%+dannyhh2000> You could do the streak offline, but then it’s also kinda boring.

[2022-12-29 15:24:38] <%Cairsoir> @xploitr13 I never played it, but seeing it has thriving scene I can only assume it has better balance to dbd at least xD

[2022-12-29 15:24:45] <%jayhena> a streak offline has almost no value anyway

[2022-12-29 15:51:27] <@%^Nightbot> Rules of a survivor escape streak: All survivors will start with no items. Survivors who escape with an item may use it in future matches. A win is 3-4 survivors have to escape the match. No offerings or item add-ons are allowed. The team can only use every perk once.

[2022-12-29 16:51:23] <sabinianmoonstone> What I love about Adrenaline Vial is that it allows you to shoulder bump at a sharp 90-degree angle.
[2022-12-29 16:51:26] <%TheKatWithABat> What were you saying about your editing?
[2022-12-29 16:51:36] <midgardfreak> You could make a video showing the diminishing returns by just playing with 1/2/3/4 chase perks and nothing else.
[2022-12-29 16:51:47] <%babyjuice20> @Leukodystrophy thx
[2022-12-29 16:51:59] <+NekoShepherd> Shadowborne is the ultimate perk, it's both a chase and info perk
[2022-12-29 16:52:01] <cd326s> Shadowborn is a settings perk
[2022-12-29 16:52:06] <%ZoopDoop_Games> what a gross hit lol
[2022-12-29 16:52:09] <+prized_1> Maybe weird interactions that new players might not know about? Like Wesker bound hitbox, what windows you can throw hatchets through, windows you can flashy save through etc.

[2022-12-29 18:46:46] <Crazymack556> only thing they can/should change about pinhead is when solving the box chains don't spawn. maybe have an addon that changes this. that would make solo Q again pinhead so much better.

[2022-12-29 19:07:48] <Dazzarth> @HopeHuggles you might be observing slower teleport speed outside of night fall. not sure on the speed boost though.
[2022-12-29 19:08:24] <RealAnaban> @ObsidianLiger if it was gift of pain you wouldnt have been able to 99 the heal lol
[2022-12-29 19:08:36] <HopeHuggles> well, it's moreso just wondering why dredge's seem to try to tp to the tile i'm approaching all the time, given that it just lets me turn around and put more distance
[2022-12-29 19:08:55] <HopeHuggles> i guess just bad plays, i wasn't sure if it was like sadako where they can go faster is all

[2022-12-29 20:07:57] <+TheFatMelon> Dead hard is funny when you wait
[2022-12-29 20:08:03] <vega813318> sounded like she was doing pushups
[2022-12-29 20:08:05] <adnips> DH should stun the killer, weaker vs gapclose nothing vs projectiles
[2022-12-29 20:08:18] <%+dannyhh2000> Choy fan boy in the chat
[2022-12-29 20:08:19] <+nooo_w4y> we need old DH back or no one plays solo survivor
[2022-12-29 20:08:21] <parizelcupireu> make it back how it was
[2022-12-29 20:08:27] <MergosWetNurse> remove dh already DansGame
[2022-12-29 20:08:32] <%EnderIdiot> 100% agree
[2022-12-29 20:08:34] <beereyy> waiting out dh is still annoying as it used to, but I don't think it should be nerfed
[2022-12-29 20:08:35] <PorousPluto0> i think i  would remove the speed boost it gives, it still tanks a hit
[2022-12-29 20:08:42] <+Nilqy> its just another mind game to dbd
[2022-12-29 20:08:43] <aaaiib> the dumb dance you gotta do is so stupid and tiring when you gotta do it 5-10 times a game
[2022-12-29 20:08:45] <!Lunnefisk> i really don't miss people using it to correct spacing errors and shit
[2022-12-29 20:08:45] <+nooo_w4y> old DH or remove dh
[2022-12-29 20:08:50] <Tyro___> would an added hinderance effect on a dh hit make a difference?
[2022-12-29 20:08:53] <%+GoreGonzola> it's tedious
[2022-12-29 20:08:55] <+themassivehunk> dead hard against trickster is bullshit.  If you dead hard the final knife you just get endurance and have your knifes reset massive time waster

[2022-12-29 20:09:19] <%EnderIdiot> slows
[2022-12-29 20:09:22] <%+dannyhh2000> How would u change dh hens?
[2022-12-29 20:09:24] <n41suu> aha
[2022-12-29 20:09:24] <+nooo_w4y> trickster lowest pick rate
[2022-12-29 20:09:26] <+bubbasboyfriend> I think they should give Bubba a christmas sweater

[2022-12-29 20:09:36] <commacawzitv> yeah the fact that its so strong against some killers and literally useless against others (slinger, legion) is an issue

[2022-12-29 20:09:48] <+Nilqy> isnt that how other perks are
[2022-12-29 20:09:58] <+Nilqy> you're not always gonna get value???
[2022-12-29 20:10:00] <!Lunnefisk> they should give clown a sweater with a knitted zanshin logo on the back
[2022-12-29 20:10:14] <@%$Soulaires_> True @lunnefisk
[2022-12-29 20:10:19] <toooth> I was watching an older dbd clip where old dh was still a thing and I never realized how ridiculous it actually was
[2022-12-29 20:10:20] <h000jun> !lurk

[2022-12-29 20:10:39] <+Nilqy> new dh is so much healthier than old
[2022-12-29 20:10:39] <redude11> imagine giving up against freddy

[2022-12-29 20:10:57] <+nooo_w4y> @toooth it s fun to play and the cost perk
[2022-12-29 20:11:03] <luleqw> hello
[2022-12-29 20:11:12] <@%$Soulaires_> Hens is literally having fun on freddy
[2022-12-29 20:11:14] <@%$Soulaires_> hensHope
[2022-12-29 20:11:15] <+vicentec17> I'd bet not consistently
[2022-12-29 20:11:20] <bladeDivac> Probably around 80%
[2022-12-29 20:11:20] <toooth> @nooo_w4y its fun for the person using it, otherwise... yeah im very glad its gone forever
[2022-12-29 20:11:21] <MergosWetNurse> not very often, tried that on a 3 gen knight
[2022-12-29 20:11:25] <MergosWetNurse> they missed often
[2022-12-29 20:11:31] <+Nilqy> as soon as you know overcharge is active
[2022-12-29 20:11:34] <+nooo_w4y> I hit them 80-95%

[2022-12-29 20:11:37] <@%$Soulaires_> This is like the time over a year ago I convinced hens to run bloodhound on billy and he genuinely got value with the perk
[2022-12-29 20:11:38] <+cybermaster12> im confident i hit 8/10
[2022-12-29 20:11:39] <+Nilqy> you can't get caught off guard
[2022-12-29 20:11:47] <@%$Soulaires_> hensFine
[2022-12-29 20:11:48] <!Lunnefisk> as a dogshit player i outplay overcharge by walking away and pretending someone else missed it peepoHappy
[2022-12-29 20:11:48] <gotthatbrrr> I wonder the minds of some killer mains be like
[2022-12-29 20:11:49] <n41suu> i never saw ada this game
[2022-12-29 20:11:50] <+vicentec17> Not the first time at least. When they know, probably a lot more consistent
[2022-12-29 20:11:55] <+TheFatMelon> If you don’t expect it it’s a lot lower
[2022-12-29 20:11:57] <bladeDivac> Yeah I don’t miss them too often, usually only when it’s before 6 o clock
[2022-12-29 20:12:04] <+nooo_w4y> Ada was on the chest
[2022-12-29 20:12:20] <n41suu> can't remember
[2022-12-29 20:12:36] <@%$Soulaires_> Works every time

[2022-12-29 20:13:18] <+Zarzunabas_> Overcharge + Oppression might be the funniest perk combo..... even in High-MMR a lot of survivors can't hit those skill checks.
