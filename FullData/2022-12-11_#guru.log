[2022-12-11 11:46:25] <%+BullseyeOW> i know if ur gm ur used to it
[2022-12-11 11:46:38] <Overlord_JC> Also some people didn't get their Top 500 rewards because of the hidden SR
[2022-12-11 11:46:48] <%+BullseyeOW> the hidden sr thing is so dumb
[2022-12-11 11:46:50] <v_deity> it's so fucking crazy that they're doing all this bullshit and confusion to the ENTIRE playerbase..... just to make Comp pander to fucking casuals and babies
[2022-12-11 11:46:51] <FrostXJr> why dont they just show the your rea; rank lol
[2022-12-11 11:47:03] <Overlord_JC> To go up one rank (so from gold to plat) is 50 games at a minimum - and that's if you WIN
[2022-12-11 11:47:07] <Hugz> 7 wins is fucking stupid
[2022-12-11 11:47:09] <%+BullseyeOW> yeah you could, in theorey, play 25 games and not see a rank adjustment
[2022-12-11 11:47:14] <%+tiberius_moon> @GURU I have to climb 600 SR
[2022-12-11 11:47:15] <@Hypnott> there should be no time gating in a cosmetic ranking system
[2022-12-11 11:47:23] <Amhash1> I feel like they just need to go back to showing sr or a new system that shows updates every game
[2022-12-11 11:47:25] <@Hypnott> if hidden mmr is your real rank it should just show
[2022-12-11 11:47:28] <DiqBird> my friend though he ended masters but ended diamond and didnt get the masters rewards
[2022-12-11 11:47:28] <%Wombat5Typhoon> ya i got time for like 2 games a week
[2022-12-11 11:47:30] <Amhash1> This system is just shit all around
[2022-12-11 11:47:35] <@Hypnott> that being said

[2022-12-11 11:47:46] <%$ICrazyJI> Why 7 wins or 20 losses? That's the most random shit ever.
[2022-12-11 11:47:47] <AstroElio> R drops enabled?
[2022-12-11 11:47:49] <@Hypnott> high elo players literally begged for fucking rank reset for years
[2022-12-11 11:47:58] <%+BullseyeOW> and if they are still putting u in ur hidden mmr games why even bother changing the visible rank
[2022-12-11 11:47:59] <mounzerthepro> they should bring back the 5 placement matches
[2022-12-11 11:48:08] <%$barbeque_dee> @AstroElio ye
[2022-12-11 11:48:09] <Overlord_JC> I don't mind decay to keep competitive sharp, but this is a scuffed way to do it
[2022-12-11 11:48:14] <@Hypnott> but it rly only benefits gm2+ players
[2022-12-11 11:48:16] <%$ICrazyJI> They were probably high and were like, "Let's randomly pick two number between 1 and 20,"
[2022-12-11 11:48:18] <%rgb_blanket> average players lke me are supposed to be around silver as we don't have the experience for high ranks but even my silver games are sweaty
[2022-12-11 11:48:22] <%$ICrazyJI> Fucking crazy.
[2022-12-11 11:48:29] <AstroElio> @barbeque_dee niceu niceu
[2022-12-11 11:48:30] <$SuperSaiyanRudy> what if a player was peak bronze? Are they decayed to tinfoil?
[2022-12-11 11:48:40] <ReyBallinx> are 11 min queue times normal for you?
[2022-12-11 11:48:41] <%$barbeque_dee> @rgb_blanket welcome to the world of smurf accounts
[2022-12-11 11:48:41] <Amhash1> Imo this does the opposite of what they want. You see how much time it will take just to get back to where you are suppose to be and will just say cba
[2022-12-11 11:48:45] <Hugz> leave it 2 blizz to make something so simple as rank this difficult
[2022-12-11 11:48:48] <Overlord_JC> Your silver games are probably full of gold and Plat players KEKW
[2022-12-11 11:48:55] <@%EvaLangwin> all this shit and the games are still a coin flip Pepega
[2022-12-11 11:49:22] <@Hypnott> a lot of people in low elo dont realize theyre not "diamond" theyre just "diamond" at a specific champ/meta
[2022-12-11 11:49:35] <%+CINABANG> wait blizzard literally saying in this that they are BSing you
[2022-12-11 11:49:46] <@Hypnott> decay benefits those who grind but hurts those who dont cause they dont get their shiny icon next to their name
[2022-12-11 11:49:55] <@Hypnott> rant over matchmaking garbage bring back 2 tanks
[2022-12-11 11:49:57] <Maxiumverse> are you guys getting any drops or is it just me?
[2022-12-11 11:50:06] <!%+oEagl3> i may come back from playing 3-9 BUT WHAT MATTERS IS GURU IS POSITIVE RN LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
[2022-12-11 11:50:20] <%$ICrazyJI> So, remember when Blizzard was like, "Hey, were going to be transparent with you and let you know what's going on." Total bullshit.

[2022-12-11 12:01:42] <%pogjoni> Hog shouldnt be a tank
[2022-12-11 12:01:55] <%$barbeque_dee> hog should be the boss at the end of pve mode
[2022-12-11 12:01:57] <+emrenvironment> Without Kiriko Hog is dogwater
[2022-12-11 12:01:59] <SoggyTaterss> Both Hog and Doom ruins support player's lives LUL
[2022-12-11 12:01:59] <@%^StreamElements> LUL
[2022-12-11 12:02:06] <Siige> orisa is also tanky af NODDERS
[2022-12-11 12:02:08] <%pogjoni> Hog should get liposuction and become a dps hero
[2022-12-11 12:02:08] <+emrenvironment> Just nade and discord

[2022-12-11 12:02:41] <%patthecatguy> Orisa more oppressive than doom tho
[2022-12-11 12:02:46] <HopsTWITCH> hog players are NOT having fun
[2022-12-11 12:02:47] <%pogjoni> Okay mobile delay i said it first

[2022-12-11 12:03:00] <@%EvaLangwin> the game is less fun when my cat Garth can select the funny broken hero and carry the game
[2022-12-11 12:03:03] <Till_Ya> Orisa is just CD Management and holding mouse 1
[2022-12-11 12:03:10] <@Hypnott> just boring meta path of least resistance
[2022-12-11 12:03:24] <%patthecatguy> Garth could lock any hero and hit rank one while sleeping

[2022-12-11 12:03:38] <!UnsaltedSalt> how would you change hog?
[2022-12-11 12:03:41] <%pogjoni> Garth is def a winston main
[2022-12-11 12:03:48] <%$barbeque_dee> garth is probably a based hanzo chad

[2022-12-11 12:04:02] <%pogjoni> They should make a fish hero in overwatch
[2022-12-11 12:04:03] <SoggyTaterss> I feel Garth would be a Sojourn
[2022-12-11 12:04:04] <%pogjoni> Or a water based hero
[2022-12-11 12:04:07] <@Hypnott> theres rly no way to change him
[2022-12-11 12:04:11] <%pogjoni> Elemental heros are always super cool

[2022-12-11 12:04:25] <%funchnit> hog is partly kept good by kiriko being insane
[2022-12-11 12:04:27] <%+BullseyeOW> garth is a junk otp

[2022-12-11 12:04:35] <ninelie08> lowered his hp and heals, hook its his gimmick
[2022-12-11 12:04:36] <%funchnit> hog was kinda shitty before kiriko release

[2022-12-11 12:04:43] <@Hypnott> youd have to give him mobility of some form and remove some of the dmg resist off his vape
[2022-12-11 12:04:45] <hoejanna> a tank should not be able to oneshot idgaf

[2022-12-11 12:05:06] <@%EvaLangwin> @Hypnott make hook widow grapple
[2022-12-11 12:05:10] <HopsTWITCH> @Hypnott small speed boost when vape
[2022-12-11 12:05:11] <dinoblaster1> make him float up like hog air balloons
[2022-12-11 12:05:29] <@Hypnott> give rein wallclimb and make winston have tranq in primal
[2022-12-11 12:05:30] <@Hypnott> game saved
[2022-12-11 12:05:33] <%pogjoni> Give hog a Bulge

[2022-12-11 12:06:17] <%KeanuSausage> remove suzu cleanse and hog has counters again
[2022-12-11 12:06:29] <%+BullseyeOW> yeah if they nerf suzu
[2022-12-11 12:06:29] <%pogjoni> Yay more fun

[2022-12-11 12:06:45] <+TrippyTriangle> don't chage hog's playstyles a lot of nerds will complain, just make him weaker, lower heal amount or damage or both
[2022-12-11 12:06:50] <%+BullseyeOW> but they buffed suzu
[2022-12-11 12:06:50] <%Wombat5Typhoon> i dont know how to fix this game but what i do know is that we have two choices: either we trust in reason and science, and nerf hog... or we trust our guts and nerf genji
[2022-12-11 12:06:56] <hutch_ow> Gg
[2022-12-11 12:07:13] <%$barbeque_dee> nerf genji to save the game
[2022-12-11 12:07:18] <%$barbeque_dee> bring back the players
[2022-12-11 12:07:19] <%$barbeque_dee> ez
[2022-12-11 12:07:26] <Siige> kiriko is the reason what makes hog really strong
[2022-12-11 12:07:27] <%Wombat5Typhoon> it's the only way
[2022-12-11 12:07:27] <SoggyTaterss> Yes we could always nerf genji again
[2022-12-11 12:07:29] <DiqBird> ana should have a widow grapple
[2022-12-11 12:07:30] <hurrakin> are u doing hog only or is that a waste of time?
[2022-12-11 12:07:37] <hutch_ow> I felt like I lowkey did good LMAO
[2022-12-11 12:07:40] <hoejanna> @trippytriangle no one can ever complain as much as mercy mains did when they completely changed her kit. So I say change hog and give him a new identity
[2022-12-11 12:07:47] <@%EvaLangwin> @hutch_ow u were good i saw u kill tracer
[2022-12-11 12:08:01] <hutch_ow> Thanks thanks

[2022-12-11 12:09:42] <%pogjoni> Qp is fun because all tanks and dps are viable
[2022-12-11 12:09:55] <%pogjoni> Even in low ranks ppl r on hog and doom or orisa
