[2023-01-07 01:10:09] <%IdolTr4sh> Nice cock bro. Good girth, pretty nice curve, tip-to-shaft ratio is perfect; only issue is the colour consistency, it gets a little light near the tip. I give it an overall 8.7/10; now onto the cum velocity testing.
[2023-01-07 01:10:25] <%epicbro795> thanks bro, it means a lot to me FeelsStrongMan

[2023-01-07 23:30:55] <enerkaizer> I didn't like the finale of smallvile. I wanted to see Clark actually wear the Superman costume at the end

[2023-01-07 23:30:59] <%Written_Saber> Also wasn't Joss Weddon canceled for being an asshole boss?
[2023-01-07 23:31:02] <SnowDayzVT> I would make a pirate game with open world shooting in an mmorpg man. With the ability to put any image on the saies/flag. For example if the scurge of the high seas was a weeb. His sail could look like hentai.
[2023-01-07 23:31:02] <vilegale> it was about teenaged Superman :D

[2023-01-07 23:31:03] <%+Bwizzle45> YES
[2023-01-07 23:31:06] <spinus_tristis> Probably
[2023-01-07 23:31:07] <%brittis_n3xus> it is worse for teens

[2023-01-07 23:31:08] <%+paraquat__> Yes
[2023-01-07 23:31:09] <$SholynMonkey> I vote yes
[2023-01-07 23:31:09] <%nickss409> probably, I wouldn't know
[2023-01-07 23:31:10] <%Dreamz_theElementalizt> Yes

[2023-01-07 23:31:13] <%Twitch_Prime_Is_Terrible> Does it get easier with experience? No
[2023-01-07 23:31:15] <%dayv23> prolly

[2023-01-07 23:31:19] <alexiscaedmont> Hope you're feeling better.
[2023-01-07 23:31:19] <crimsonharvest> probably, because the canvas is smaller so to speak
[2023-01-07 23:31:19] <%Zarimuss> @fx_studi0s English only stream, prob because mods can't tell what you are saying
[2023-01-07 23:31:19] <%+sonic_slades> It's worse for both, but teenagers have it amplified.
[2023-01-07 23:31:22] <%ScienceTiny> heartbreak is worse the first time, probably.
[2023-01-07 23:31:22] <%netic91> its worse for them
[2023-01-07 23:31:22] <spinus_tristis> @Written_Saber I think he cheated on his wife too
[2023-01-07 23:31:23] <%progamermike18> yes
[2023-01-07 23:31:24] <%+Phyn1x__> Yea

[2023-01-07 23:31:25] <zaaura123> being teenager is like shaving your pubes you dont want to lose a part of you but it eventually leaves
[2023-01-07 23:31:25] <%$EchoSensei> But Adult heartbreak is usually after a much longer time together
[2023-01-07 23:31:26] <thunderwave37> Yes very much so… sadly

[2023-01-07 23:31:41] <spinus_tristis> Teen brains are also structured differently
[2023-01-07 23:31:41] <%freegamer05> my teen age resume is : school,brain issues & pc
[2023-01-07 23:31:43] <%Chelusyth> ye because of the hormones are wacky
[2023-01-07 23:31:46] <%+Alphacombat92> Social standing means much more to teenagers than it does to older adults
[2023-01-07 23:31:47] <NiktrisVoltaris> yes because teeny are WAY more emotional and also don't always know that the pain goes away
[2023-01-07 23:31:48] <%+sonic_slades> If teenagers experience heartbreak, they'll be more defensive and warped for love when they adult.
[2023-01-07 23:31:50] <%steveio19> That's a sentance. "more time to fixate on pain"
[2023-01-07 23:31:52] <goose_kaiju> you don't realize nothing matters yet when you're young LUL
[2023-01-07 23:31:54] <tylovetx> i disagree, teens have mote advantages now.

[2023-01-07 23:32:00] <BestroChen> ooooo
[2023-01-07 23:32:01] <%ApocalypseGardener> Adults have more life experiences to put it in context
[2023-01-07 23:32:02] <%$EchoSensei> Adult heartbreak is worse, but its "quieter" than teens
[2023-01-07 23:32:03] <SnowDayzVT> I would make a pirate game with open world shooting in an mmorpg man. With the ability to put any image on the saies/flag. For example if the scurge of the high seas was a weeb. His sail could look like hentai.

[2023-01-07 23:32:32] <%+sonic_slades> Adult heartbreak is not as bad as teenagers, we have maturity, teens have yet to mature at that point.
[2023-01-07 23:32:33] <goose_kaiju> after a while you get desensitized to soul crushing disappointment
[2023-01-07 23:32:39] <$gutluffy22> Yes

[2023-01-07 23:33:00] <%g33k_7h3_m4g3> Your perception changes as you get older.  When you’re young, you’ve not experienced much pain, so it seems worse.  As an adult you’re just more able to cope.  Source: I was a kid once and now have kids.
[2023-01-07 23:33:00] <%+theRx_> Yeah zentreSuffer
[2023-01-07 23:33:02] <spinus_tristis> The thing about adult heartache is that you can drink away the pain
[2023-01-07 23:33:08] <%brittis_n3xus> its just as hard for adults, but theyve grown to experience it more
[2023-01-07 23:33:08] <%guztawskykow> @fx_studi0s Also the constant @-ing might be obnoxious. We're all talking to Mel here, your messages aren't more important then everyone elses.
