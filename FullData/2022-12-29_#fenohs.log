[2022-12-29 18:19:58] <oldtaricisbesttaric> priest  actually worst class
[2022-12-29 18:19:59] <dalitzking> people mulligan so wrong for miracle at bad ranks it's crazy
[2022-12-29 18:20:06] <%darkseid_omega> Ramp tier 3 -- cant wait for reddit to continue complaining about it

[2022-12-29 18:20:11] <VikingJackAU> @jjj67 Tech? the quest?
[2022-12-29 18:20:11] <nikke35_> ramses says bombs are favored
[2022-12-29 18:20:12] <+No_Gods> hsreplay puts frost mage as favoured into quest dh and miracle rogue at top 1k KEKW
[2022-12-29 18:20:16] <neonbul> ramp druid is broken
[2022-12-29 18:20:20] <%+CursedFish> @dalitzking nope, the deck is just broken that is all
[2022-12-29 18:20:27] <boynissi> miracle rogue should be the benchmark when they do nerfs. it's amazing how devs managed to make a deck tier 1 on the right hands, but tier 4 on wrong hands (plats). it gives everyone a reward for learning

[2022-12-29 18:38:30] <%piki_hs> what they meant is its trash in high legend, good in diamond-plat
[2022-12-29 18:38:36] <luckstard> they say miracle rogue and quest dh are top legend stuff so spitter hunter should dominate non top legend ranks
[2022-12-29 18:38:36] <@%Tinyfred> It doesnt make sens3

[2022-12-29 18:38:43] <JJJ67> Pros wont mind it, but noobs will
[2022-12-29 18:38:44] <NovaBSL> It's a good deck at lower ranks
[2022-12-29 18:38:44] <oldtaricisbesttaric> the first two are strong at high elo, hunter at nid
[2022-12-29 18:38:45] <copperscum> bro vs feno reading actualy unwatchable
[2022-12-29 18:38:47] <Bilwitz> its saying the top rank will be Quest hell and the bottom will be splitter hell
[2022-12-29 18:38:47] <%lewis143> Smooth brain deck for noobs - Plat 5 btw
[2022-12-29 18:38:48] <%stingray772005> trash in high legend good everywhere else
[2022-12-29 18:38:48] <+SirMeI> bro its not that hard
[2022-12-29 18:38:48] <prabh23> It means it‚Äôs good in low Elo where ppl wont play miracle rogue and dh
[2022-12-29 18:38:49] <tromic> they are saying it is tier 1 if no rogues or dh

[2022-12-29 18:38:55] <iTvngo> They are saying quest dh and miracle rogue are popular at higher ranks and spitter hunter is great at lower ranks, which rogue and dh isn‚Äôt popular at
[2022-12-29 18:38:57] <nvmjesushere_> it means spitter is to rest of the ladder, what miralce and quest is to top 100 @FenoHS
[2022-12-29 18:38:57] <%+crashed_btw> in high legend it doesn't work in low ranks yes
[2022-12-29 18:39:00] <@%Tinyfred> I think he just means that WHILE

[2022-12-29 19:15:40] <tholyus> For myth of suing comma before and, here is english grammar book. The answer depends on how you are using or. "Always place a comma before or when it begins an independent clause, but if it begins a dependent clause, don't." So, think about it @FenoHS
