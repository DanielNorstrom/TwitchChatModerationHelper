You MUST have a closed hand (do not call and open your hand). You also are only allowed to discard the tile your drew, win off a draw, or win off someone elses discard.

[2023-01-01 02:30:47] <!%BluBlu_BluBlo> @Cirno_TV you might wanna luck 1 click for this one. Thats requires counting for all mines that left and its still gonna be gamble
[2023-01-01 02:30:47] <%OhIToot> @Cirno_TV so the top left 2 already has a mine around it, but two unknowns. therefore only one of those can have a mine. however, the 4 only has 2 marked, but 3 empty spaces, but the top and top left can only have one mine between the two. therefore, the top right of the 4 MUST be a mine, which solves the 2 to the right of it

[2023-01-01 02:33:54] <%boldCactuslad> @entendir well we can also look at it in terms of mine density but how that affects difficulty is debatable
[2023-01-01 02:33:57] <%Pixelago> you've more safe to mark
[2023-01-01 02:33:58] <%Houdini111> cirAngy Churro. When you know all of a number's mines are accounted for, click all the rest of the surrounding ones @Cirno_TV
[2023-01-01 02:34:00] <%salpo_nolobio> top of top left 2 is safe
[2023-01-01 02:34:06] <kynbound> the one above the 3 is safe
[2023-01-01 02:34:06] <%Haprenti> for that 1 you don't know where the mine is, but you know it can't be to the right
[2023-01-01 02:34:07] <KotaBear4400> @TsukiBaka i think a smaller, tighter board might have more potentially for the bad stuff whereas a bigger board will tend to an average more? ThinkingWright or maybe that doesnt make sense and im dumb

[2023-01-01 04:11:12] <%Sozu_> @boldCactuslad he did stop calling it the horse by the end of his 2nd match, yes
[2023-01-01 04:11:17] <%ArtisticSumo> That's not how this works Cirno
[2023-01-01 04:11:20] <%Mes_> brute forcing, the classic Cirno method
[2023-01-01 04:11:21] <%ArtisticSumo> You don't guess
[2023-01-01 04:11:22] <%ChaosLordR> it doesn't work in real sudokus well because if you screw one up, you screw the rest

[2023-01-01 04:11:31] <%Brezitrex> In pen and paper Sudoku it wouldn't tell you if you're wrong so you shouldn't guess
[2023-01-01 04:11:31] <%ArtisticSumo> No
[2023-01-01 04:11:32] <%A_Name_That_Isnt_Taken> dont guess on sudokus, if you mess up you wont find out till MUCH later and it will be too late to fix it cirno

[2023-01-01 04:11:40] <%ArtisticSumo> You never have to guess
[2023-01-01 04:11:41] <%ChaoticFart> you can solve for the 1 in the middle 3x3 first

[2023-01-01 04:11:50] <%kirbydance> you can literally not guess at any of them
[2023-01-01 04:11:52] <%ChaoticFart> then that will give you the 1 for the top middle 1
[2023-01-01 04:11:58] <%boldCactuslad> so for really easy sudokus you can totally make a ton of guesses since there are thousands of valid solves
[2023-01-01 04:12:00] <%ArtisticSumo> @Illylia the clean one?
[2023-01-01 04:12:02] <%boldCactuslad> but for hard ones there's only a few :)

[2023-01-01 11:21:14] <FireJadian> because things that appear take so long to reappear
[2023-01-01 11:21:14] <!%BluBlu_BluBlo> it helps when you know KQJ or 6-7-8 but it not always happens

[2023-01-01 15:20:36] <%Bbmeltdown> Does it seem at higher levels they want you to guess more?
[2023-01-01 15:20:48] <%ChaoticFart> i tried to find matching first then i realized it was complementary
[2023-01-01 15:20:50] <@%Toonfish> I think the higher levels are for 5k+ viewer streams

At one point, he was called to an old Ministry of Defense base to examine something, and was told to follow the railway tracks and it'd take it to them. Someone had stolen a @30 foot bridge and about 3 miles of railway tracks, and he was confused when he couldn't find them to follow.

[2023-01-01 22:31:29] <%+Elisianthus> @Cirno_TV: The theft story: My father works in the planning and environment section of the council. At one point, he was called to an old Ministry of Defense base to examine something, and was told to follow the old ordinance-shipping railway tracks and it'd take it to the place in question. He couldn't find said lines and was confused, turns out someone had stolen a 30 foot iron bridge and about 3 miles of railway tracks and because they'd been disused for 30 years no-one had noticed.

[2023-01-01 23:58:41] <!%NopeTooFast> well yeah, that's gonna be down to what the speedrun skips and what the speedrun needs. like if the speedrun skips the fun parts of the game and has awful tricks that require either insane precision, rng or both, then ofc it's gonna not be fun
[2023-01-01 23:58:41] <%SellingUsedThighHighs> RE4 Speedrun is fine if you're not a cultist

[2023-01-01 23:59:40] <+frightlever> @RevanTheGray I think Banished From was a real anomaly. I'd have preferred if they'd concentrated on the normal stuff and ignored all that world-ending demon thing
