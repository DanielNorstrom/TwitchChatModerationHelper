[2023-01-05 01:28:08] <siruveri> @siruveri I was just wondering if there's any reason why it's 180 instead of purely 190 or 240.
[2023-01-05 01:28:10] <tofiiiee> Just came from yt yo Faide
[2023-01-05 01:28:13] <@%RipCrow97> !180
[2023-01-05 01:28:13] <@%^Nightbot> Faide prefers to play on 180 because trying to play on 240hz can apparently cause input delay in-game. In addition, it just feels better, so thank you for your understanding :) Have a pleasant day

[2023-01-05 02:18:08] <%+mrpink140> I have no idea
[2023-01-05 02:18:09] <marshywar> helps with recoil in a way
[2023-01-05 02:18:10] <+wonkerking> Probably just scared movement I think
[2023-01-05 02:18:11] <DamsoDeemsss> not me i'm not a pussy
[2023-01-05 02:18:11] <unknowingdumdum> yes it does,for me at least

[2023-01-05 02:18:17] <+ammolator> that guy's name was jake
[2023-01-05 02:18:17] <image_ex> Some can‚Äôt crouch while shooting
[2023-01-05 02:18:17] <wraithmainalc> Cause u can‚Äôt control if they‚Äôre to close cause sense is too fast or slow @faide
[2023-01-05 02:18:17] <shmurda_uchiha95> idk why

[2023-01-05 02:18:18] <%+CSharpEnjoyer> Low fov maybe so they back up
[2023-01-05 02:18:18] <talha_i_m> Proabably trying to get behind the door/cover
[2023-01-05 02:18:19] <+raginrasta> Bots think it helps with recoil
[2023-01-05 02:18:20] <$AsleepII> And to start running
[2023-01-05 02:18:21] <ramyboy_23> Love from the rgv

[2023-01-05 02:18:21] <+FumFumm> i only run backwards al game
[2023-01-05 02:18:22] <idrxpt_finesse> Keep you at distance so aim assist sticks
[2023-01-05 02:18:23] <mochiiko_> I think is because better aim?

[2023-01-05 02:18:25] <decentawarzonere> It‚Äôs a panic thing
[2023-01-05 02:18:26] <!vDokii> TheThing TheThing TheThing TheThing TheThing
[2023-01-05 02:18:28] <+PM_paint> probably lower fov
[2023-01-05 02:18:28] <%jyel_fs> It takes to much time to turn around
[2023-01-05 02:18:30] <reallydok> Waddle and s is the best play
[2023-01-05 02:18:31] <+kennyboy2> They have no movement so their only move is to shoot
[2023-01-05 02:18:31] <imjin2> basically when you shoot and go backwards the algorithsm and the calculations decrease bullet spread by 0.00001 percent which causes them to beam the fuck out of you
[2023-01-05 02:18:31] <%alphanumeric9803> Distance from body blocking
[2023-01-05 02:18:31] <+QueenCessa_> Helps with recoil
[2023-01-05 02:18:31] <%+mrpink140> PAnic mode
[2023-01-05 02:18:33] <sodacat15> Yeah, it decreases the recoil
[2023-01-05 02:18:34] <S0lidGoat> I panic tea bag
[2023-01-05 02:18:34] <%jaycat234> honestly i dunno
[2023-01-05 02:18:35] <%+LuvRell> gives you stronger aimbot
[2023-01-05 02:18:36] <+AnArcaneOne5> controller aim is like aiming with just your keys and an aimbot.  no mouse movement or "aim"
[2023-01-05 02:18:36] <@%^Nightbot> cunt roller
[2023-01-05 02:18:37] <freeccks> so they don't get pushed
[2023-01-05 02:18:37] <%+FrostNix> I think it's a bad habit for them
[2023-01-05 02:18:37] <%alienabs> it's literally just a panic thing lmao
[2023-01-05 02:18:40] <+yungsteazy> Spas probably
[2023-01-05 02:18:40] <Fall_Prophet> what he asked?
[2023-01-05 02:18:41] <itsmellzbellz> It‚Äôs because im bad at the game ok
[2023-01-05 02:18:41] <ramyboy_23> Teach me how to move like u
[2023-01-05 02:18:42] <MazenTQ_> its probably just instinct for some people
[2023-01-05 02:18:43] <Tay69jk> i panic throw my gun :)

[2023-01-05 02:18:45] <+xHeathh> If you‚Äôre too close there‚Äôs no aim assist
[2023-01-05 02:18:46] <+chasepasquale> probably not on purpose, just nervous
[2023-01-05 02:18:46] <7erk> @Faide nah the reason is bc you scared the mans so he was trying to shoot and back out
[2023-01-05 02:18:47] <troublegod1> They think it controls recoil
