[2022-12-28 13:44:22] <%smokeygerald> don't try
[2022-12-28 13:44:22] <%ZENDRY> only Vaati knows lore
[2022-12-28 13:44:24] <%ZCrimes> yep, its on crack grealish
[2022-12-28 13:44:24] <Rixstarian> The lore is difficult. Souls storytelling is always obscure

[2022-12-28 13:44:27] <Loiner> it's loosey goosey
[2022-12-28 13:44:27] <stylage> correct, most people dont follow any souls story
[2022-12-28 13:44:30] <%+NotTheRealJazz> yeah you gotta read item descriptions and infer stuff
[2022-12-28 13:44:31] <%svekky> its japanese what'd you expect KEKW
[2022-12-28 13:44:33] <%numendisal> you have to watch lore videos
[2022-12-28 13:44:40] <Shackleberry112> We rely on Vaati's videos to explain it KEKW
[2022-12-28 13:44:47] <+AR___99> Very, 6 different endings I believe, different gods and shit
[2022-12-28 13:44:47] <%+wheeel> sometimes even things get lost in translation
[2022-12-28 13:44:48] <%+Godofdeer> if you want to know whats going on in the lore watch some VaatiVidya videos
[2022-12-28 13:44:48] <%+Zuqar> from what i've seen people just play to beat the bosses no one cares about story KEKW
[2022-12-28 13:44:49] <%+RJACE_> can I post the official story trailer?
[2022-12-28 13:45:03] <mitchellx1992> easy way to look at it, ranni didnt want to follow her destiny so done a bunch of fucked up things to follow her own chosen path
[2022-12-28 13:45:05] <%+NotTheRealJazz> well you can read all the item descriptions too, its a big puzzle
[2022-12-28 13:45:10] <%Codexnecro> has he fought Astel yet?
[2022-12-28 13:45:14] <+tehfintal> TL:DR. Ranni was bound by the two fingers. You got her the blade so she could kill hers and is now free to be moon Bae.. @BreaK in the most simple sense

[2022-12-28 13:49:52] <Rixstarian> @ZCrimes Pulling is drawing something to your camp on purpose. Leashing is the tether between their designated area & where you're trying to pull.

[2022-12-28 15:11:46] <+v1sgoth> @BreaK hold down the attack when u can it does more damage hits up to 3 times i believe
[2022-12-28 15:11:47] <%mrWiggumz> upgrading the spear makes this boss trivial

[2022-12-28 15:50:14] <%+Crowtein_> oculus audio is a plugin for unity made by meta/facebook apparently

[2022-12-28 15:50:38] <%CompletelyBlank_> Dark Souls is more linear
[2022-12-28 15:50:45] <+I_Dabble_In_Finagling> @wbbigdave Exactly a very sensible decision, now lets laugh at this bulb struggling with basic things in Tarkov KEKW
[2022-12-28 15:50:47] <thirty3baboons> meta bought oculus VR a few years back.

[2022-12-28 15:51:41] <%hashmanZA> at least
[2022-12-28 15:51:42] <%Untalented> Dark Souls feels very rewarding though and its very linear compared to elden ring

[2022-12-28 16:18:54] <explodingheadguy> I work with diagnosing adhd among other things (or did before i got permanently sick). It's a set of sliding scales, not either/or, and the world we live in is a major part of the reason adhd is a problem at all tbh.

[2022-12-28 16:42:02] <%+Seedub7> Tarkov needs to have a shooting range or something to do during queue times. 12 mins on Customs is ridiculous.

[2022-12-28 16:49:44] <%+Seedub7> @wbbigdave I think that is what their "Arena Mode" is for but a dumbed down version of this game would be 10/10. I've said that for years now. There is no place for the casual player.

[2022-12-28 19:47:57] <%+Vitalitea_> Theres no community knowledge any longer for the mainstream shooters
[2022-12-28 19:48:05] <%+Sevenyellowducks> tbf you really didn't talk to chat alot during pubg days

[2022-12-28 19:48:14] <%$dogedia> thanks :)
[2022-12-28 19:48:19] <%+CoyneDawg> It’s because when you play PUBG you know what you’re doing, but when you play eldenring people need to hold your hand or you’re stuck for 6 hours
[2022-12-28 19:48:19] <%Lemings> kleier Break can't even see text right in front of his face, RTS and management games would be impossible KEKW
[2022-12-28 19:48:19] <Yeosha> pubg still my favorite in twitch

[2022-12-28 19:49:56] <%+Nazomet> I like the variety, but elden ring its not my thing. ETF is awesome and I like to watch you play it so I dont have to LUL

[2022-12-28 19:50:48] <%FunkyFlump> I think the issue with PUBG etc. Is everyone has an expectation. Elden Ring is fresh, Tarkov can be similar at times. PUBG is so standard, it's very on rails from a content standard.
[2022-12-28 19:50:51] <%seanlb> lol rawrry
