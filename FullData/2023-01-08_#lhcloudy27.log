[2023-01-08 01:32:54] <@^Nightbot> My favorite streamer is LHChair. he is very dark, has great lumbar support, and honestly he carries the stream when Cloudy is gone. He comes equipped with a very powerful height adjusting lever that’s perfect for our favorite streamer. LHChair doesn’t interact much so it’s really helps when chat can make their own content

[2023-01-08 01:53:28] <@^Nightbot> My favorite character is the reaper guy. he is very powerfull. special move, honestly is one of the best in the game and so he comes equipped with these two revolvers and only takes about 3 or 4 shots to actually execute a kill so it comes really in handy specially when you come from the side

[2023-01-08 01:56:10] <%H0lyMongo> I think you should break and do Rein
[2023-01-08 01:56:21] <%iPRIxMAi> If you're stuck in bronze you just suck
[2023-01-08 01:56:21] <9talesow> what are you cooking in this ungodly hour
[2023-01-08 01:56:24] <TrapezeMe> bronze team mates be different tho....
[2023-01-08 01:56:27] <%+Aceattack> no need to go bronze. his mmr will be masters/gm within 10 games
[2023-01-08 01:56:33] <%surelyURjokingMrFeynman> gold to GM playing off meta hero with self nerf
[2023-01-08 01:56:36] <nicol4501> he is cooking spagetti
[2023-01-08 01:56:40] <%ian11232324> what's not allowed
[2023-01-08 01:56:41] <generalvonroom> i wonder how far you'd get with intimidation reinhardt
[2023-01-08 01:56:43] <YoungsterGlenn> But why do teammates matter
[2023-01-08 01:56:45] <%+Aceattack> look at his gameplay. a gm player plays like gm even in bronze
[2023-01-08 01:56:58] <+Xeffary> @generalvonroom wtf is intimidation reinhardt
[2023-01-08 01:57:04] <+Xeffary> only shield?
[2023-01-08 01:57:05] <TrapezeMe> @YoungsterGlenn well when your ana has 1.2k dmg and 800 healing 5 minutes into a match, it matters
[2023-01-08 01:57:07] <generalvonroom> yes

[2023-01-08 01:57:22] <%spaxnooo> no way bro is still doing this
[2023-01-08 01:57:25] <Lvzt_> shield only
[2023-01-08 01:57:25] <generalvonroom> but firestrikes allowed i guess
[2023-01-08 01:57:39] <%+Aceattack> if you are hardstuck it’s not your teammates. you need to improve
[2023-01-08 01:57:46] <%iPRIxMAi> @TrapezeMe there's no excuse in bronze. You can 1v5 in bronze because they get lost, walk in straight lines, stand still, are out of position 100% of the time and can't aim. If you're stuck in bronze - this isn't your game
[2023-01-08 01:57:53] <+noMereTeddy> @TrapezeMe then their ana will be the same. on average you're just going to climb if you're outperforming
[2023-01-08 01:57:56] <%needabetterpig> @trapezeme go soldier brother you'll 100% get out if you're good enough. hog? you should not be in bronze if you're good enough
[2023-01-08 01:57:57] <YoungsterGlenn> @TrapezeMe Enemies are bronze too you can just kill them without healing
[2023-01-08 01:57:57] <generalvonroom> i saw awkward playing no dmg supp in gold and that was pain to watch
[2023-01-08 01:58:04] <nicol4501> but will we get a support series...ever?
[2023-01-08 01:58:08] <AfflictionsAgents> @spaxnooo he still has two rank ups to go of course he's still goin
[2023-01-08 01:58:10] <InFlames82> ye you dont get "stuck" in any rank
[2023-01-08 01:58:19] <%+Aceattack> healing is low but their dps are also doing bronze dmg so it doesn’t matter
