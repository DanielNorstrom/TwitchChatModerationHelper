[2023-01-06 10:30:39] <steeldeity06> i cannot believe my fav streamer is finally moving to the game I've been loving for the past few months Kreygasm
[2023-01-06 10:31:07] <@%WildB0at> @spyro_za what do you think about the retreat mechanic
[2023-01-06 10:31:22] <~%Spyro_ZA> its good
[2023-01-06 10:31:27] <~%Spyro_ZA> makes rng feel less bad
[2023-01-06 10:31:31] <@%WildB0at> good for noobs
[2023-01-06 10:31:47] <~%Spyro_ZA> nah its goof to mitigate rng
[2023-01-06 10:32:20] <~%Spyro_ZA> would be nice for example in gwent if you could retreat after missing 5 golds and only lose half mmmr
[2023-01-06 10:32:22] <steeldeity06> good in general. rng doesn't feel as bad and climbing in this game is more about cubes rather than winning

[2023-01-06 10:36:58] <+fluffyturt1e> chavez gives you a different play then heimdal and has 1 more power you dont draw until 6 so wont be clunky
[2023-01-06 10:37:03] <%shashank0034> i have 100 games with movement. cut the 2 power dude for scarlet witch
[2023-01-06 10:37:07] <Count_Dooku_breachin> chavez ultimately makes your draws better before 6, cause u can only draw her at 6
[2023-01-06 10:37:09] <steeldeity06> Armor for dhang chi since you have slots
[2023-01-06 10:37:12] <%shashank0034> cut kraven for skarlet eirch

[2023-01-06 10:37:29] <%shashank0034> u dont
[2023-01-06 10:37:38] <%shashank0034> u don't need 4s
[2023-01-06 10:37:45] <+fluffyturt1e> your 2's will fill in the 4's
[2023-01-06 10:37:49] <%shashank0034> u just play multiple man and copy him
[2023-01-06 10:37:59] <%shashank0034> cut kraven for scarlet witch trust me
[2023-01-06 10:38:05] <%shashank0034> u don't need 4s and 5s
[2023-01-06 10:38:15] <steeldeity06> you can put bm or ironman
[2023-01-06 10:38:17] <%shashank0034> it clogs
[2023-01-06 10:38:26] <%shashank0034> u don't need 4s or 5s
[2023-01-06 10:38:28] <steeldeity06> people use them in movement
[2023-01-06 10:38:31] <%shashank0034> in this deck
[2023-01-06 10:38:38] VIEWERS: 49
[2023-01-06 10:38:39] <%shashank0034> multiple man is so many points
[2023-01-06 10:38:48] <+fluffyturt1e> curve isnt as important here as it is in lets say hearthstone
[2023-01-06 10:38:52] <%shashank0034> u don't 5s and 4s
[2023-01-06 10:39:03] <Count_Dooku_breachin> storm can be a consideration, since u can move cards into the storm lane later, and replace bad locations for moving cards
[2023-01-06 10:39:13] <%shashank0034> curve isn't important in this deck. even if u waste energy, playing multiple is good and boosting him
[2023-01-06 10:39:21] <%shashank0034> sont play storm, dosent fit mana curve
[2023-01-06 10:39:25] <%shashank0034> don't*
[2023-01-06 10:39:26] <steeldeity06> blue marvel

[2023-01-06 10:39:36] <%shashank0034> u wanna play multiple man
[2023-01-06 10:39:44] <%shashank0034> then Hulk
[2023-01-06 10:39:51] <%shashank0034> or forge then multiple ma
[2023-01-06 10:39:55] <quantoll> You want to save iron fist for vulture
[2023-01-06 10:40:10] <%shashank0034> play sunspot, i usually skip turn 1
[2023-01-06 10:40:18] <%shashank0034> this is why sunspot is impory
[2023-01-06 10:40:24] <%shashank0034> important*
[2023-01-06 10:40:35] <%shashank0034> this deck wastes a lot of energy
[2023-01-06 10:40:38] VIEWERS: 49
[2023-01-06 10:40:55] <%shashank0034> if u have 3 energy, but need to play multiple man, u need to play multiple ma
[2023-01-06 10:40:55] <steeldeity06> Shashank stop lmao. movement is already iffy you don't want cards without synergy
[2023-01-06 10:40:56] <@^Nightbot> HamStare
[2023-01-06 10:40:58] <tobimk4> only times this deck looked good to me where when human torch or dagger worked out somehow or opponent hit location bingo
[2023-01-06 10:41:14] <%shashank0034> @steeldeity06 i literally have 100 games plus with this deck
[2023-01-06 10:41:16] <+basti_> wrong deck? =)
[2023-01-06 10:41:31] <%shashank0034> @spyro_za try to play multiple man in mid or right most
[2023-01-06 10:41:31] <+basti_> happens to me all the  time
[2023-01-06 10:41:35] <%shashank0034> also try not to fill ur rows

[2023-01-06 10:43:16] <prfaust> this game has no competitive scene right now, you can only act like it has one by farming bots in infinite to reach 200+
[2023-01-06 10:43:37] <prfaust> there are less bots compared to last month though
[2023-01-06 10:44:20] <+fluffyturt1e> hes probably gonna spectrum

[2023-01-06 10:46:07] <%shashank0034> if u don't draw iron fist or multiple man by turn 3 just retreat
[2023-01-06 10:46:12] <%shashank0034> this is how the deck works
[2023-01-06 10:46:26] <%shashank0034> retreat and go next

[2023-01-06 10:47:18] <%shashank0034> cloak is good
[2023-01-06 10:47:28] <agent_182> bc his vulture would move
[2023-01-06 10:47:29] <Crayonfart_> opp can benefit from it i guess
[2023-01-06 10:47:35] <agent_182> is what i meant

[2023-01-06 10:48:10] <Crayonfart_> ironman doubles locations power
[2023-01-06 10:48:12] <Crayonfart_> not cards
[2023-01-06 10:48:12] <agent_182> works with forge
[2023-01-06 10:48:13] <%shashank0034> @spyro_za it doubles hulk buster
[2023-01-06 10:48:15] <quantoll> Iron man doubles points on location, not individual power
[2023-01-06 10:48:39] <%shashank0034> its 4x or something on double buster
[2023-01-06 10:48:43] VIEWERS: 86
[2023-01-06 10:49:17] <agent_182> kraven right is bad since most your cards make stuff go left
[2023-01-06 10:49:31] <%shashank0034> play hulk
[2023-01-06 10:49:32] <agent_182> but i guess you got a good location
[2023-01-06 10:49:37] <steeldeity06> that is a snap

[2023-01-06 12:42:01] <imdoingapoo> how long until you start playing real players?
[2023-01-06 12:42:14] <moonbr0> Word of advice for you mr strimmer, it is generally better not to snap before all 3 locations are revealed. You could get screwed any time with those locations, like that one Sakaar Hulk buster game.
[2023-01-06 12:42:19] <ibrylliant> i played gwent since beta, and this feels like a good continuation to that type of card game
[2023-01-06 12:42:27] <@%+xahverius> imdoingapoo supposedly it's a mix of bots + real players
[2023-01-06 12:42:48] <quantoll> The higher your rank and CL the less bots you encounter
[2023-01-06 12:42:54] <steeldeity06> @moonbr0 that is not true generally. depends on the deck you're playing and your hand

[2023-01-06 12:44:10] <osmosisthehermit> that goes both ways tho
[2023-01-06 12:44:15] <moonbr0> @steeldeity06 I disagree. So many locations can instantly make you regret snapping before you see all the locations. Sakaar, The Peak, Bar with no name... so many.
[2023-01-06 12:44:29] <%sp1cy_gr> can you derank in this game btw?
[2023-01-06 12:44:36] <notlvcatto> @sp1cy_gr Absolutely

[2023-01-06 12:45:20] <edenbeast1408> A good hand is a good reason to snap, always waiting for all 3 locations reveal is definitely not the way to go
[2023-01-06 12:45:22] <steeldeity06> @moonbr0 let's take negative for example. you always snap if you draw psylocke and negative before turn 3
[2023-01-06 12:45:26] <quantoll> @sp1cy_gr You can, but when you hit infinite you can't go lower than that

[2023-01-06 12:47:18] <@%+xahverius> steeldeity06 yep there's no point in buying the pass cause I only have two P4 cards
[2023-01-06 12:47:23] <@%+xahverius> in my case i mean
[2023-01-06 12:47:34] <@%+xahverius> i could not use zabu
[2023-01-06 12:47:36] <moonbr0> @steeldeity06 But then on Turn 3 the third location turns out to be Weirdworld or Lamentis and you've just lost your entire gameplay and 1 extra cube. It's rare I know, but it still could've been avoided if you just waited to see the last location.

[2023-01-06 13:06:33] <moonbr0> @steeldeity06 I think you're grading of power is off if you don't think of movement as "strong". It is a much stronger deck at p3 than Cerebro, Ongoing or Odin On Reveal. This decks are just "decent". Movement has a much easier time than they do. It's not top tier, but it is still generally "strong.:

[2023-01-06 13:08:27] <moonbr0> @Benelioto I never said or implied movement was meta lol. I'm saying it is still a generally strong deck, meaning it will perform at a good rate compared to other decks that fall off way harder. I have a pretty good idea of how decks perform just by looking at card quality.

That deck is one of the easiest decks to shut down I've ever seen. Movement is quite harder to shut down, but doesn't have as many points ofc.

[2023-01-06 14:06:28] <moonbr0> It generally doesn't matter too much because if they, or even you, run into a counter deck, you can always just retreat on the first sign of it and lose a single cube. That's the philosophy of Marvel Snap right now. @Spyro_ZA

[2023-01-06 14:35:51] <moonbr0> Depending on the deck and the RNG, Iceman in Bar Sinister could be an instant concede.
[2023-01-06 14:35:53] <dogma94> unless you havekillmonger I'd never iceman on sinister monka
[2023-01-06 14:36:11] <+Martin_Silenus> @tobimk4 it is pretty much a gamba - you can hit all the right things and just win, or do absolutely nothing
[2023-01-06 14:37:00] <+Martin_Silenus> if your deck has nothing better to play there - it's actually a decent idea a lot of the time
[2023-01-06 14:37:27] <tobimk4> @Martin_Silenus I would assume it's kinda timing dependant but Id bet it goes wrong more often than not

[2023-01-06 14:38:22] <+Martin_Silenus> @tobimk4 you can't really time it, since there is never any guarantee they have what you want to hit in hand, so yeah it is very much just a gamba

[2023-01-06 14:39:36] <dogma94> btw not sure if you appreciate backseating (sorry if not), but usually it's better to save iron fist than playing him on turn 1 without good follow-up

[2023-01-06 14:40:04] <moonbr0> I'd do Forge and pass
[2023-01-06 14:40:19] <tobimk4> @Martin_Silenus scorpion for example can hit 5-6 cards vs slow decks in which case I can see it working( being timed well) but iceman .. you play it early they still draw a card every turn ; it hits one card many times you lose , it hits all the cards once you also probably lose ?
[2023-01-06 14:40:30] <tobimk4> like I said Id bet it's bad more often than not

[2023-01-06 15:12:12] <tobimk4> you cant really 'craft' anything , you gotta get lucky with the cards you open or get in token shop
[2023-01-06 15:12:19] <@^StreamElements> If you are enjoying the stream, don't forget to leave a follow to keep updated of when I go live :)
[2023-01-06 15:12:30] <dracophoenix_> You're approaching pool 3, let's see what cards you pull early and what's in the shop

[2023-01-06 15:13:38] <Iwilljoy> There is no meta decks, meta cards i would say. Like Aero and Leader. You can craft very much you want to and be successful until you faced Leader)
[2023-01-06 15:13:38] <Zentimuz> In the token shop I'd go for a card that is needed for the entire deck to work like Sera is an example @Spyro_ZA
[2023-01-06 15:13:45] <Zentimuz> !card Sera
[2023-01-06 15:13:45] <@Hiketron> Sera | 5/4 | Series 3 | Ongoing: Cards in your hand cost 1 less. (minimum 1)

[2023-01-06 15:14:12] <ZilverZap> yea good pool 3 cards to pick up would be dr doom. aero, leader, sera, destroyer
[2023-01-06 15:14:13] <%shashank0034> advancing is useless
[2023-01-06 15:14:27] <%shashank0034> u need 3000 colelction level to get all cards
[2023-01-06 15:14:29] <+greenehawk> not useless as a streamer
[2023-01-06 15:14:33] <%shashank0034> thats just pool 3
[2023-01-06 15:14:33] <ZilverZap> actually you're about 30 off from pool 3
[2023-01-06 15:14:37] <ZilverZap> so not too far off
[2023-01-06 15:14:55] <ZilverZap> f2p btw YEP
[2023-01-06 15:14:58] <Zentimuz> rushing is fine I believe you get 3000 tokens when you hit pool 3 which is huge
[2023-01-06 15:15:01] <tobimk4> the packages that include tokes are the only thing you really wanna pick up imo
[2023-01-06 15:15:15] <%shashank0034> buy 8000 gold then
[2023-01-06 15:15:15] <tobimk4> everything else doesnt really speed you up that much
[2023-01-06 15:15:30] <%shashank0034> wtf, why u buying then
[2023-01-06 15:15:43] <%shashank0034> its the most efficient

[2023-01-06 15:18:13] <Iwilljoy> Just be aware, that when pool 3 starts you are goes to a casino-in cache boxes you can find random shit, often it is 3  or 4 in a row without cards, so spending money do not guarantees you anything
[2023-01-06 15:18:49] <+greenehawk> its a new card in every bother box for green caches and one in four once you hit the orange boxes

[2023-01-06 15:19:28] <@Hiketron> Wasp | 0/1 | Series 3 | has no ability
[2023-01-06 15:19:30] <dracophoenix_> I mean at least wasp can be useful in Lockjaw and maybe Patriot

[2023-01-06 15:19:49] <LauMei27> i want wasp for patriot deck
[2023-01-06 15:19:51] <ZilverZap> problem is you need to actually pull lockjaw or patriot
[2023-01-06 15:20:09] <ZilverZap> even then patriot is pretty gimped if you don't have mystique

[2023-01-06 15:30:11] <%+xspectrum7> if you wanna buy something from token shop it shoud be  aero, leader, daredevil, dr doom, magneto, death or destroyer @bright_storm

[2023-01-06 15:34:07] <tobimk4> @Iwilljoy Ive said before that if you think you'll have fun with it it's probably worth but many players are restricted by the tokens they have access to so buying cards like deadpool and then not enjoying them cuz they dont beat the good decks is suboptimal imo

[2023-01-06 15:35:18] <tobimk4> tbh the destroy deck is probably better without deadpool. DP is just a fun build atm

[2023-01-06 15:59:04] <%+Raspxxx> @Spyro_ZA how good is the progress compared to gwent?
[2023-01-06 15:59:19] <@%+xahverius> @Methaies Methaies it's impossible to make more than 1 or 2 decks as f2p KEKW
[2023-01-06 15:59:20] <wetboionacroissant> Sentinel doesn't clone, just adds a base copy, if you were wondering about buffing it
[2023-01-06 15:59:36] <@%+xahverius> i'm just stuck with 1 deck, could do a 2nd inefficient one

[2023-01-06 16:00:43] <+Martin_Silenus> sentinel also sheds any debuffs or cost alterations when copied
[2023-01-06 16:00:51] <%Methaies> I stoped playing hearthstone because I wasn't collecting enough resources to keep up with changing meta decks. You were forced to buy packs or play 10h a day to get enough stuff

[2023-01-06 16:01:59] <+untilragnarok> but Snap looks like it is going to be really good here
[2023-01-06 16:02:12] <eeliigaa_> how does forge not buff the sentinel copy?
[2023-01-06 16:02:15] <eeliigaa_> theres no way
[2023-01-06 16:02:22] VIEWERS: 210
[2023-01-06 16:02:30] <+Martin_Silenus> THough since new cards descent through pools, originally you only see them rarely, so they don't immediately ruin the metagame if they are broken
[2023-01-06 16:02:30] <wetboionacroissant> @eeliigaa_ cuz it adds a base copy, not clone
[2023-01-06 16:02:41] <steeldeity06> it's not shooting it's buffing
[2023-01-06 16:02:41] <osmosisthehermit> It takes around 3 months to finish pool 3 if you do dailies if Im not mistaken
[2023-01-06 16:02:45] <steeldeity06> different tower
[2023-01-06 16:03:09] <Iwilljoy> In the future cards of pools 3 and higher gonna be cheaper and more ofter appears at caches. So no problem at all

[2023-01-06 16:03:28] <+Martin_Silenus> And in Snap you don't need full collection to build competitive decks. It helps, but you can make do with what you have

[2023-01-06 16:07:36] <%Methaies> the lvls determine matchmaking or is there mmr on to?

[2023-01-06 16:08:31] <+shiva_ffviii> yes
[2023-01-06 16:08:38] <+shiva_ffviii> Rank does play a factor of course
[2023-01-06 16:08:41] <osmosisthehermit> 100 is infinite. You get rewards until 100
[2023-01-06 16:08:43] <+shiva_ffviii> but not really until 100+
[2023-01-06 16:08:48] <+shiva_ffviii> do you see people with more collections
[2023-01-06 16:08:54] <+shiva_ffviii> cause your MMR inflates
[2023-01-06 16:09:09] <eeliigaa_> season pass has rewards
[2023-01-06 16:09:12] <wetboionacroissant> @shiva_ffviii yeah, he fought pool3 cards but is pool2, if he climbs ranks faster than average
[2023-01-06 16:09:19] <insaniity> oh yeah it's real fun being late series 3 and facing people with multiple series 5 cards KEKW
[2023-01-06 16:09:28] <insaniity> because of rank/mmr
[2023-01-06 16:09:34] <+shiva_ffviii> yeah if your winrate is insane
[2023-01-06 16:09:36] <%insilico_man> i heard if you rank up high enough insnap you queue into bots again is that correct?
[2023-01-06 16:09:39] <+shiva_ffviii> you will facre higher collection
[2023-01-06 16:09:39] <eeliigaa_> well everyone plays all the same cards in high pool anyway
[2023-01-06 16:09:54] <+shiva_ffviii> yes
[2023-01-06 16:10:02] <+shiva_ffviii> bots are very prevelant in high mmr

[2023-01-06 16:10:33] <+ShdwRptr> The really high MMR bots are BS. They actively cheat
[2023-01-06 16:10:35] <osmosisthehermit> Its fine. You won a bunch so now you are getting matched against better decks
[2023-01-06 16:10:39] <eeliigaa_> this deck youre playing is good
[2023-01-06 16:10:40] <+shiva_ffviii> bots are a problem because the game is regional matchmaking
[2023-01-06 16:10:44] <%shashank0034> hard Kapp 'ed?
[2023-01-06 16:10:49] <+shiva_ffviii> so theres not enough players at higher ranks or something
[2023-01-06 16:10:53] <wetboionacroissant> Infinaut and Dino are most consistent in Pool2
[2023-01-06 16:10:58] <%insilico_man> is that not counter intuitive that the game can be played by a bot even at the highest levels? @shiva_ffviii @xahverius
[2023-01-06 16:10:59] <eeliigaa_> super skrull is a really strong card
[2023-01-06 16:11:13] <eeliigaa_> if you see youre against ka-zar just play it
[2023-01-06 16:11:13] <insaniity> you get an insane card for an ongoing matchup
[2023-01-06 16:11:13] <steeldeity06> pool 5 pog
[2023-01-06 16:11:21] <+shiva_ffviii> It sucks @insilico_man but they say it will get better as people develop a collection and get better
[2023-01-06 16:11:22] <osmosisthehermit> @shiva_ffviii There is but it depends on the amount of cards you have also.
[2023-01-06 16:11:26] <eeliigaa_> super skrull dumpsters ka-zar blue marvel
[2023-01-06 16:11:29] <+shiva_ffviii> But yes, it is really shitty, Bots can read your cards
[2023-01-06 16:11:32] <+shiva_ffviii> read your plays
[2023-01-06 16:11:34] <+shiva_ffviii> they know RNG outcomes
[2023-01-06 16:11:35] <%Methaies> @insilico_man chess can be played by a bot better than any human KEKL
[2023-01-06 16:11:35] <+Martin_Silenus> super skrull is a very weird tech card, which can completely ruin certain decks, and then do nothing against most LUL

[2023-01-06 16:12:52] <%Methaies> It makes sense for this mobile model. Imagine you sit down on your toilet and have to wait a minute before an opponent shows up

[2023-01-06 16:12:53] <steeldeity06> you win right they cannot do anything there
[2023-01-06 16:13:20] <osmosisthehermit> the bots are there to reduce wait times YEP
[2023-01-06 16:13:34] <eeliigaa_> torch is pool 3
[2023-01-06 16:13:42] <%insilico_man> do bots ever snap or retreat?
[2023-01-06 16:13:46] <+shiva_ffviii> SD have said the bot issue will fix itself in time, with more players getting cards
[2023-01-06 16:13:55] <steeldeity06> @insilico_man they snap...not retreat
[2023-01-06 16:13:56] <+shiva_ffviii> the problem is the top players with full colections are like 5k +
[2023-01-06 16:14:00] <wetboionacroissant> @insilico_man if they are winning 2 locations on 5, they insta snap
[2023-01-06 16:14:02] <osmosisthehermit> Yes the bots snap and retreat
[2023-01-06 16:14:05] <+shiva_ffviii> For example someone like me who started on release
[2023-01-06 16:14:09] <+shiva_ffviii> I have 2.2k collection
[2023-01-06 16:14:11] <+shiva_ffviii> less than half

[2023-01-06 16:14:25] <@%+xahverius> @osmosisthehermit but this game is so popular right now, do they need that? games take like what, 3 minutes?
[2023-01-06 16:14:28] <+Martin_Silenus> bots are not much of a problem in my experience

[2023-01-06 16:14:32] <steeldeity06> @osmosisthehermit I've never seen a bot retreat in my 3 months of playing this game
[2023-01-06 16:14:34] <eeliigaa_> imagine not doing a post-beta reset
[2023-01-06 16:14:41] <wetboionacroissant> @shiva_ffviii I'm in the same boat as you, Dino & Daredevil carried me
[2023-01-06 16:14:51] <+shiva_ffviii> I mean, I have no problem getting infinite
[2023-01-06 16:14:58] <+shiva_ffviii> I just am bored of playing same decks
[2023-01-06 16:14:59] <+shiva_ffviii> like dino

[2023-01-06 16:15:06] <osmosisthehermit> Im pretty sure if you snap on 6 some bots will retreat
[2023-01-06 16:15:07] <+Martin_Silenus> @xahverius they explained why they need bots and the primary reason is cube economy - without bots it's a zero-sum game
[2023-01-06 16:15:13] <%insilico_man> thanks chat
[2023-01-06 16:15:44] <osmosisthehermit> which you shouldn snap on 6 anyway
[2023-01-06 16:16:11] <+Martin_Silenus> injecting bots at lower levels seems like a reasonable idea, though high-level ladder-padding bots, which cheat actually piss off a lot of people, and I think rightfully so
[2023-01-06 16:16:14] <steeldeity06> @shiva_ffviii i started on release as well have 2k collection level. it can get boring so i just plough my way to infinite then play the most random shit ever KEKW
[2023-01-06 16:16:25] <+shiva_ffviii> Yeah bro
[2023-01-06 16:16:29] <+shiva_ffviii> The fun in the game is in infinite

[2023-01-06 16:21:25] <+shiva_ffviii> Leech is a weird one, cause he only works really in leader decks
[2023-01-06 16:21:27] <osmosisthehermit> Im ok with leech
[2023-01-06 16:21:29] <+Martin_Silenus> Iceman can randomly win you games, scorpion sometimes wins you games, a lot of cards do, it's kinda by design. I think it is only truly frustrating when it happens on turn 6 and you have no option to retreat
[2023-01-06 16:21:33] <+shiva_ffviii> you sac turn 5 onn point to make sure you can recover turn 6

[2023-01-06 16:23:35] <+Martin_Silenus> in most situations even the best hits from gambit can't win you the game, tbh

[2023-01-06 16:23:49] <+shiva_ffviii> Yeah but the game is more akin to gambling than traditional card games
[2023-01-06 16:23:59] <eeliigaa_> this is a retreat

[2023-01-06 16:37:09] <+shiva_ffviii> killmonger is too much of a risk for that

[2023-01-06 16:37:10] <@%+ShadowplayRed> then they Snap and hit Killmonger t6

[2023-01-06 16:39:12] <steeldeity06> fun fact: killmonger is one of the most played and strongest tech cards in the game. especially at when you after you reach P3.
[2023-01-06 16:39:59] <insaniity> KEKW ?

[2023-01-06 16:40:49] <wetboionacroissant> SS is p2w card
[2023-01-06 16:41:21] <+shiva_ffviii> better get used to seeing surfer LUL
[2023-01-06 16:41:26] <bloodybluntt> what why
[2023-01-06 16:41:31] <+ShdwRptr> Second Dinner has been putting high power Pool 5 cards into the Season Pass every month. It's not expensive but it's definitely an advantage
[2023-01-06 16:41:50] <steeldeity06> currently surfer and zabu decks are the top of the game
[2023-01-06 16:41:59] <ctssPLay> why not iron fist mid u would get 6 cost card for free
[2023-01-06 16:42:18] <+ShdwRptr> They are but you need a lot of other cards to build those top decks. The Zabu deck is stacked with Pool 4/5 cards and lots of Pool 3
[2023-01-06 16:42:32] <+shiva_ffviii> not really
[2023-01-06 16:42:36] <bloodybluntt> chavez or heimdall on throne better but here's hoping
[2023-01-06 16:42:36] <steeldeity06> @shdwrptr true.
[2023-01-06 16:42:37] <eeliigaa_> LUL
[2023-01-06 16:42:38] <+ShdwRptr> Even Surfer has a lot of Pool 3 cards needed
[2023-01-06 16:42:41] <+shiva_ffviii> you just need Brood for surfer to be decent
[2023-01-06 16:42:42] <steeldeity06> surfer is fine with p3

[2023-01-06 16:43:45] <@^StreamElements> Thank you for following tharkTV :)
[2023-01-06 16:43:49] <+tharkTV> Im collection level 1100 and mystique is in the shop should i grab her?
[2023-01-06 16:43:56] <wetboionacroissant> @steeldeity06 zabu is good with discard too
[2023-01-06 16:43:57] <+shiva_ffviii> If you have decks that run her
[2023-01-06 16:44:04] <+shiva_ffviii> dont buy her if you dont have cards for her
[2023-01-06 16:44:07] <kr3du> @tharkTV 1000%
[2023-01-06 16:44:15] <+ShdwRptr> @tharkTV If you want to play Wong or Patriot then definitely yes. If not then you can wait
[2023-01-06 16:44:23] <+shiva_ffviii> mystique is not an auto include card
[2023-01-06 16:44:27] <+tharkTV> Ok i dont have wong
[2023-01-06 16:44:47] VIEWERS: 207
[2023-01-06 16:44:53] <+shiva_ffviii> I would save if you dont run patriot
[2023-01-06 16:44:59] <steeldeity06> @wetboionacroissant very iffy. it's decent but definitely not competitive
[2023-01-06 16:45:08] <+shiva_ffviii> Wong is a pretty bad deck as you go higher
[2023-01-06 16:45:13] <kr3du> mystique fits in a lot of decks, not just patriot
[2023-01-06 16:45:15] <+shiva_ffviii> the zabu version is ok
[2023-01-06 16:45:17] <bloodybluntt> if you have cerebro mystique would be good too
[2023-01-06 16:45:20] <+tharkTV> Any series three cards that you recommend to snag from the shop
[2023-01-06 16:45:25] <+shiva_ffviii> Mystique does but isnot a auto include
[2023-01-06 16:45:30] <Iwilljoy> Mystique is gorgeous
[2023-01-06 16:45:31] <+ShdwRptr> @shiva_ffviii I disagree. Wong is excellent in Zabu Surfer decks
[2023-01-06 16:45:34] <eeliigaa_> wogn gets rogued hard
[2023-01-06 16:45:35] <steeldeity06> @shiva_ffviii wong is strong but wong decks are noot good for cuberate
[2023-01-06 16:45:53] <+shiva_ffviii> I just said Zabu is decent LUL
[2023-01-06 16:46:00] <+shiva_ffviii> Wong based decks on their own are trash
[2023-01-06 16:46:06] <steeldeity06> you can win with it quite an amount but not get cubes
[2023-01-06 16:46:13] <wetboionacroissant> @steeldeity06 it is actually competitive, 0.4 cube rate with 4k games from random people that netdecked some streamer
[2023-01-06 16:46:27] <steeldeity06> yeah wong is a win more card but less cubes
[2023-01-06 16:46:27] <+ShdwRptr> Wong on it's own is definitely trash now. Cosmo, Rogue, and Enchantress are everywhere
[2023-01-06 16:46:36] <+shiva_ffviii> Not just that
[2023-01-06 16:46:37] <+shiva_ffviii> Aero
[2023-01-06 16:46:39] <+shiva_ffviii> Goblins
[2023-01-06 16:46:46] <+shiva_ffviii> I could list about 8 cards that counter wong
[2023-01-06 16:46:47] <steeldeity06> @wetboionacroissant sure but it's nowhere near zabu darkhawk or zabu Spiderman and abs man

[2023-01-06 16:47:13] <%metaGL> 486
[2023-01-06 16:47:16] <wetboionacroissant> pay up
[2023-01-06 16:47:39] <+shiva_ffviii> But to the guy who suggest buying mystique because she in run in some decks
[2023-01-06 16:47:39] <maximus4realg> not adding vision?
[2023-01-06 16:47:46] <+shiva_ffviii> Wouold you rather pay 1k for mystique or aero
[2023-01-06 16:47:49] <bloodybluntt> oof no move for u
[2023-01-06 16:47:57] <+shiva_ffviii> or dr doom, leader, magneto
[2023-01-06 16:48:02] <alexc3580> @shiva_ffviii none of them aero is gonna get nerfed
[2023-01-06 16:48:11] <+shiva_ffviii> Aero losing 1 power doesnt matter
[2023-01-06 16:48:12] <+shiva_ffviii> LMAO
[2023-01-06 16:48:16] <wetboionacroissant> @shiva_ffviii aero would still se play at 0 power

[2023-01-06 16:49:17] <+ShdwRptr> Aero is 100% worth the credits. The nerf is 1 power and it's the best card in the game
[2023-01-06 16:49:27] <+shiva_ffviii> And is run in any deck you want
[2023-01-06 16:49:33] <wetboionacroissant> Areo used to be 5/6, then 5/8, now 5/7, I would play it at 5/1
[2023-01-06 16:49:41] <bloodybluntt> naw
[2023-01-06 16:49:51] <Szympansior> but u gonna have chavez always...

[2023-01-06 16:50:09] <+shiva_ffviii> to be fair, you could run mystique in Dino and have great results
[2023-01-06 16:50:17] <+shiva_ffviii> so if you wanna ply Dino, buy mystique
[2023-01-06 16:50:21] <+shiva_ffviii> not an auto include card tho

[2023-01-06 16:58:00] <+shiva_ffviii> I will admit the first season I played a lot, but also it was easier to climb in pool 2
[2023-01-06 16:58:01] <+shiva_ffviii> so idk
[2023-01-06 16:58:02] <Akai_kami> i started the game one month after release. reached 70 but i was too aggressive in raising my ranks... was playing pool 3 in like a month in
[2023-01-06 16:58:05] <bbaattoonn19> ongoing dude
[2023-01-06 16:58:19] <bloodybluntt> when you put hulkbuster on multiple man, play iron first first before playing hulkbuster to also move a buffed multiple man
[2023-01-06 16:58:20] <eeliigaa_> skill gap
[2023-01-06 16:58:22] <+shiva_ffviii> Yeah thats where you fked up @Akai_kami
[2023-01-06 16:58:24] <Akai_kami> once i reached 70 it was pool 3 cards only vs my pool 2
[2023-01-06 16:58:25] <bbaattoonn19> move is bad

[2023-01-06 16:59:06] <bloodybluntt> rock on mid pog
[2023-01-06 16:59:10] <+shiva_ffviii> Dino or Ongoing is most consistent yh
[2023-01-06 16:59:32] <eeliigaa_> just got killmonger who dis
[2023-01-06 16:59:34] <+shiva_ffviii> is Moon Girl pool 2? I forgot
[2023-01-06 16:59:44] <Iwilljoy> I have a feeling that half of the day i have very easy games, but another half I struggling A LOT
[2023-01-06 16:59:49] <eeliigaa_> i think pool 1 or 2
[2023-01-06 16:59:57] <eeliigaa_> yeah pool 1
[2023-01-06 16:59:57] <+ShdwRptr> Ongoing might be the best Pool 2 along with Kazaar for cube rate. You can steal a lot of 8 cube games by surprise
[2023-01-06 17:00:03] <eeliigaa_> moon girl is pool 1
[2023-01-06 17:00:07] <+ShdwRptr> Dino is a decent 2-4 cube deck
[2023-01-06 17:00:11] <eeliigaa_> bc shes a devil dino card
[2023-01-06 17:00:15] <+shiva_ffviii> Ongoing gets you more cubes for sure

[2023-01-06 17:07:18] <Akai_kami> its the best card in the game
[2023-01-06 17:07:41] <Bright_Storm> I don’t think it’s worth spending gold for missions tbh
[2023-01-06 17:07:55] <+shiva_ffviii> It is and it isnt
[2023-01-06 17:07:56] <bloodybluntt> nice
[2023-01-06 17:08:02] <wetboionacroissant> Why do you refresh once at a time, instead of filling all 6 missions at once?
[2023-01-06 17:08:23] <bloodybluntt> if you refresh all missions at once it gets more efficient lol
[2023-01-06 17:08:27] <+shiva_ffviii> @Bright_Storm I have a maybe unpopular opinon that rushing to 1k CL is best
[2023-01-06 17:08:34] <bloodybluntt> yeppers
[2023-01-06 17:08:37] <+shiva_ffviii> because after 1k you enter the gacha game
[2023-01-06 17:08:40] <wetboionacroissant> You can have 6 at a time

[2023-01-06 17:11:37] <+shiva_ffviii> no you have to play it
[2023-01-06 17:11:40] <quantoll> You need to draw and play it
[2023-01-06 17:11:40] <+shiva_ffviii> when drawn
[2023-01-06 17:11:41] <bloodybluntt> you need to draw and play it
[2023-01-06 17:11:43] <Iwilljoy> you can read in click on THOR

[2023-01-06 17:11:57] <Iwilljoy> no, you must draw the mjolnir
[2023-01-06 17:12:02] <+shiva_ffviii> so they are a combo

[2023-01-06 17:12:52] <+shiva_ffviii> but you will be saving the whole season

[2023-01-06 17:13:03] VIEWERS: 181
[2023-01-06 17:13:11] <+shiva_ffviii> I think your first season just get missions and get to 1k CL as fast as you can
[2023-01-06 17:13:12] <+shiva_ffviii> imo
[2023-01-06 17:13:24] <wetboionacroissant> Buying credits with gold is same as missions, except you don't progress battlepass
[2023-01-06 17:13:47] <Akai_kami> @shiva_ffviii but why?
[2023-01-06 17:13:55] <bloodybluntt> yeppers
[2023-01-06 17:14:08] <+shiva_ffviii> @Akai_kami because you will face pool 3 pretty soon if you are good, you will want cards
[2023-01-06 17:14:13] <+shiva_ffviii> instead of saving the whole season
[2023-01-06 17:14:15] <+shiva_ffviii> and getting tilted
[2023-01-06 17:14:18] <bloodybluntt> buster would proc rsft
[2023-01-06 17:14:29] <quantoll> You still get 6 drop even if the last card will move
[2023-01-06 17:14:32] <wetboionacroissant> yes
[2023-01-06 17:14:40] <Akai_kami> thats why i was raising my rank aggressively
[2023-01-06 17:14:40] <wetboionacroissant> 0/0 KEKW
[2023-01-06 17:14:42] <+shiva_ffviii> obviously if you dont care, saving is better because the bundles give you b etter value
[2023-01-06 17:14:51] <bloodybluntt> RIP no destroy
[2023-01-06 17:14:53] <Akai_kami> so that i face better cards and learn from losing

[2023-01-06 17:20:06] <wetboionacroissant> @alexocpmurphy it's a good game, problem is it is a mobile game which comes with some bad stuff
[2023-01-06 17:20:19] <+shiva_ffviii> Its also your collection level man
[2023-01-06 17:20:43] <dice__17> kazoo can gives you more 8 cubes win, it has a lot of suprise power in turn 6

[2023-01-06 18:24:42] <Decode789> @eeliigaa_ no
[2023-01-06 18:24:49] <wetboionacroissant> swarm is 0 cost
[2023-01-06 18:24:51] <Iwilljoy> thats why
[2023-01-06 18:25:04] <+Jekkfje> swarm multiplies every time it gets discarded so he can get like 4 of them if he discards enough
[2023-01-06 18:25:08] <Decode789> Because of sokovia he kept discarding
[2023-01-06 18:25:10] <+Jekkfje> at 0 cost
[2023-01-06 18:25:21] <Iwilljoy> it also was buffed by Nakia

[2023-01-06 19:10:11] <Zentimuz> I expected my CL1200 at beta to be wiped TearGlove
[2023-01-06 19:10:25] <dice__17> leader is literally nilfgaard
[2023-01-06 19:11:00] <%+merlincrh> Leader is annoying cuz it copies the STATE of the last cards you play. So if you do cool things that boost, it copies your cards boosted. And then they boost again cuz their abilities replay.
[2023-01-06 19:11:01] <quantoll> Leader is snap version of pre-nerf Renfri, Kinda, except you don't have to build deck around him
[2023-01-06 19:11:19] <%+merlincrh> So basically you have to constantly have cosmo for leader
[2023-01-06 19:11:23] <Zentimuz> Just don’t double Death and She Hulk + Taskmasrer like me CoolCat

[2023-01-06 19:16:22] <dice__17> i use this deck to reach infinite in early pool 3, it became kinda bad after you progress deeper into pool 3
[2023-01-06 19:17:22] <Zentimuz> I just checked my progress, my last pool 3 cards are Aero & Rogue TearGlove
[2023-01-06 19:17:31] <dice__17> dino is still good in pool 3 and that's it
[2023-01-06 19:17:35] <%+maichenambrai> Less like a traditional competitive card game.  More like poker where you're trying to come out positive cubes over many games in a period with snapping and retreating smartly.  You can climb with a negative win rate.

[2023-01-06 19:18:02] <+korzen> @Spyro_ZA change of game and stream time... permamemt or just trying sth new???
[2023-01-06 19:18:06] <elmaxoupixou> what's the point of snapping ?
[2023-01-06 19:18:28] <Zentimuz> I do agree, I made a booster farming deck at climbed from 70-90 just by knowing when to and not to retreat or snap
[2023-01-06 19:18:44] <%+maichenambrai> Snapping is more powerful the earlier you do it, as soon as the game advances to the next turn it's worth double cubes.
[2023-01-06 19:18:45] <%criticalinfusion> snapping is best mechanic in this game
[2023-01-06 19:19:07] <%criticalinfusion> locations revela maybe second best
[2023-01-06 19:19:19] <dice__17> economic system is shit
[2023-01-06 19:19:25] <%+maichenambrai> Your ability to evaluate your hand and the locations vs what your opponent is doing early on will determine cube earning.
[2023-01-06 19:19:30] <%criticalinfusion> yeah and other stuff is kinda mediocre

[2023-01-06 19:22:12] <%+maichenambrai> People love tier lists for games.  The tier list for earning cubes in this game is really your ability to make good judgment calls.  If cubes are what you're after.
[2023-01-06 19:22:12] <Zentimuz> Mr. Strimer I play and watch thank you very much CoolCat
[2023-01-06 19:22:39] <%+maichenambrai> People don't like retreating because they think they'll always win.  It's why Vegas and the lottery exist.
[2023-01-06 19:22:52] <Zentimuz> and knowing how to pilot your deck instead of unga bunga copy paste CoolCat
[2023-01-06 19:23:38] <%criticalinfusion> for climbing it should just be mathematical decision what to do

[2023-01-06 19:28:50] <Zentimuz> 3-4 after locations reveals and depending on what opponent is playing but definitely before you reveal your best move

[2023-01-06 19:30:19] <Zentimuz> no moongirl so mid combo
[2023-01-06 19:30:27] <Zentimuz> you only have Marvel
[2023-01-06 19:30:38] <Zentimuz> so this match is 50/50 to win in my opinion
[2023-01-06 19:30:40] <%+maichenambrai> In your collection range most people playing Cable/Sentinel are playing Dino.

[2023-01-06 19:35:23] <%+maichenambrai> Rhino costs one more.  You can get much more power for 3 mana.
[2023-01-06 19:35:32] <eeliigaa_> rhino > scarlet witch

[2023-01-06 20:19:20] <%+maichenambrai> You can fill their board with cards like Debrii that you saw earlier. Then Hazmat their side which has more cards.
[2023-01-06 20:19:35] <dracophoenix_> I think they mean Hazmat is a build around that's bad to get randomly

[2023-01-06 20:54:28] <%+maichenambrai> The delta on win rates for *most* decks is very close.  The exceptions are pure move and discard. they are slightly weaker.
[2023-01-06 20:54:28] <Zentimuz> I’ve noticed from your gameplay that is your issue and the best is dino destroy or dino control
[2023-01-06 20:54:33] <GaBane22> One thing that helped me climb is that I was playing very strong finisher decks
[2023-01-06 20:54:37] <GaBane22> so I could snap very late
[2023-01-06 20:54:44] <Zentimuz> snap before your big play around turn 5
[2023-01-06 20:54:47] <GaBane22> And people would not see the loss coming
[2023-01-06 20:55:08] <GaBane22> I was playing stuff like Destroyer, Deathwave and Hela combo, all 3 were really good at catching opponnents off guard

[2023-01-06 21:03:05] <edenbeast1408> your deck is fine for that collection level
[2023-01-06 21:03:17] <+ShdwRptr> I second Dino Control. This is the list I'm using. You can replace Quinjet, Aerom and Leader without much issue at your CL: Quinjet, Scorpion, Armor, Sentinal, Lizardm Cosmo, Enchantress, Moon Girl, White Queen, Dino, Aero, Leader
[2023-01-06 21:03:24] <%Methaies> he does BatChest
[2023-01-06 21:03:40] <Zentimuz> I already suggested Dino Control/Destoy package
[2023-01-06 21:03:42] <Iwilljoy> you have no choice basically.Dino is the best for you right now, maybe ongoing decks be slightly better
[2023-01-06 21:03:45] <+ShdwRptr> I would put in Ice Man, Vision, and America Chavez to replace the Pool 3 cards
[2023-01-06 21:04:08] <Akai_kami> why arent u using vision in the movement deck?
[2023-01-06 21:04:10] <Zentimuz> Enchantress isn’t ongoing she’s on reveal

[2023-01-06 21:06:10] <Nukyur1991> vision isn't that great, 5 energy which means you can only move him once...

[2023-01-06 21:11:59] <Nukyur1991> Just an idea... cosmo to protect your Dino against Chang?
[2023-01-06 21:12:01] <+rotello1> The turns are flexible tho
[2023-01-06 21:12:18] <+rotello1> you dont always want to go Dino on 5
[2023-01-06 21:12:19] <Zentimuz> @spyro_za storm + Jessica fits best for this skeleton

[2023-01-06 21:12:51] <+rotello1> Cosmo is prolly better than killmonger most cases, to protect from Shang chi

[2023-01-06 21:13:35] <Zentimuz> storm is for control to force the opponent to play something
[2023-01-06 21:13:40] <Mithfin> You have to decide if you want to stick to the same plan if possible, or you want options to be more adaptable. Generally, sticking to the plan works better if your snaps are on point.
[2023-01-06 21:13:55] <ctssPLay> heres my deck its kinda simple # (1) Agent 13 # (1) Iceman # (2) Cable # (2) Scorpion # (3) Zabu # (4) Jubilee # (4) Shang-Chi # (4) Enchantress # (4) Jessica Jones # (4) Moon Girl # (4) White Queen # (5) Devil Dinosaur
