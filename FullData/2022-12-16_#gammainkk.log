[2022-12-16 13:54:51] <blisssttv> There was so many things he could have done but the fact that he went on a rant for someone responding to you fully honest pisses me off

[2022-12-16 13:55:15] <justintoons20> his response should have been simple for example he could have said sorry to hear that my prayers to you that's it.

[2022-12-16 14:28:09] <%connorball1997> The UwU counter revolution was begun the day S.nuffy embraced the racoon and did her voice reveal. So many people kinda came out since then. Its not a bad thing to have a "voice" but I much prefer that Vtuberz can be their most authentic selves with chat

[2022-12-16 14:29:13] <PhantomFlan> There's also the fact that you can only have your voicemod license on a single pc, so you have to make sure you remember your license key
[2022-12-16 14:29:24] <@%ThatVtuberAlex> what I do now?!?!
[2022-12-16 14:29:25] <M3RedGT> @TamakoHenka american "customer service voice" is the creepiest sh* i've ever experienced LUL
[2022-12-16 14:29:27] <%JazzKarrah> I love your voice because its like, super energetic and chaotic if that makes any sense, its super fun to listen to

[2022-12-16 14:30:02] <!%+heckelchris> It‚Äôs like how dazey use to stream with her baby dazy voice. now she uses her real voice but can slip back when ever she wants
