[2023-01-05 16:51:52] <%SquidSquaaad> @timmyjarman "you may cast" Yep]
[2023-01-05 16:52:20] <%Goody_Phil> you should have cast the book with plains to allow casting 2nd asmo for 2nd cookbook, maybe @aspiringspike
[2023-01-05 16:52:26] VIEWERS: 911
[2023-01-05 16:52:48] <+TauNeutrino2> I think it had to be the step through tapped for plains if the first one was countered
[2023-01-05 16:52:54] <%gildedgosling> @aspiringspike should we expect any more Commander content like the professor vid?

[2023-01-05 16:53:13] <%Goody_Phil> I feel like cookbook is more important than the asmo, no?
[2023-01-05 16:53:17] <+TauNeutrino2> the professor vid was really cool

[2023-01-05 17:02:44] <+b1aubaer> does opponent see, which cards you exile, or is it hidden?
[2023-01-05 17:02:46] <JammyUF99> is it not better to have the thassa's oracle trigger on the stack?
[2023-01-05 17:02:50] <%deamzer> vial in thoracle to show opp they're dead?
[2023-01-05 17:02:58] <%+makeshiftreaper> @pinkranger If you can fetch a "goblin" with a card then you can get that card
[2023-01-05 17:03:03] <LightSpiritz> So you have to click like 150 times from here to win?
[2023-01-05 17:03:05] <@%Squee_GoblinNabob> @napoleon_borntoparty probably, but actual oops would still probably be better
[2023-01-05 17:03:07] <+TauNeutrino2> @JammyUF99 this line doesn't waste the oracle into removal

[2023-01-05 17:03:28] <flowzillah> would it be worth milling with the oracle trigger on the stack so that the opponent can see the entire combo and be more likely to scoop?
[2023-01-05 17:03:32] <+TauNeutrino2> oracle first if you're worried about counterspell, exile first if you're worried about bolt
[2023-01-05 17:03:40] <zabelb> With Stoneforge mystic and vial usually on two is it worth playing one reality chip that you can vial in after fetching with Stone for?
[2023-01-05 17:03:53] <%fourdeltavictor> They do get to see your entire deck
[2023-01-05 17:04:04] <%Dade_Murphee> Is there a window when a removal spell can break this up or can you always respond with more mantle/untap triggers?

[2023-01-05 17:23:15] <%Goody_Phil> breach would be a 3 mana bolt
[2023-01-05 17:23:18] <@%phuckingmagikal> I think GDS is the better breach red deck

[2023-01-05 17:25:19] <%Goody_Phil> @hugheist you'd also need 7 cards in the yard to be able to cast that bolt twice, 10 for three times
[2023-01-05 17:25:40] <%Goody_Phil> that scenario just does not happen nearly enough to warrant the inclusion, I think

[2023-01-05 18:29:52] <%Aquinas9> We really need to go to 1 card in library. That way we can beat removal for Vial and removal for Oracle. We can never beat a Thoughtseize effect.

[2023-01-05 18:30:43] <%+ROTSam> that's not correct. if Oracle dies devotion is 0 but thoracle says X or less

[2023-01-05 18:30:50] <%Aquinas9> @rowrow_ What if they destroy Vial with Kolagan's Command or something? Leaving 1 card in library allows us to draw the final card in draw phase and cast Oracle in our next main phase.

[2023-01-05 18:32:06] <rowrow_> they have to think about thoracle in this spot is all

[2023-01-05 18:36:55] <rowrow_> !saga
[2023-01-05 18:36:56] <@%^MTGBot> Alpine moon and Spreading Seas remove land types (not enchantment types) and the printed chapter abilities. So Urza's Saga becomes a saga with no chapters, that means it's final chapter is zero and will therefore always be at or past it's final chapter, zero. This causes Urza's Saga to be sacrificed.

[2023-01-05 18:46:28] <%riotboyjhin> for the sake of consistency would you consider finding space in gruul food for 22 lands? I know you generally play the deck you want to play, meaning if you wanted 22 you would play it. But I think theres a reasonable argument for further increase in lands. What is your opinion?

[2023-01-05 18:49:02] <%riotboyjhin> and follow up to my previous question. how did you settle on 20. That feels extremely stretched with 4 saga. I generally like understanding the thought process before attempting to make changes.

[2023-01-05 18:52:25] <sambooch> Its an obvious angle shoot when they go "you didnt say the magic words" and your story to the judge is "i didnt say the ability because they did the ability and I saw them do it"

[2023-01-05 18:53:35] <+ThtColorblindGuy> as a former judge those situation suck, usually the players nearby are aware enough of the games next to them to help with sorting things out. if i couldnt get any info from likely non-bias sources, the player with more details comes off as more believable
[2023-01-05 18:53:37] <%+Drexxie> I'm not sure what the rule is for angle shooting but that is 100% what it was

[2023-01-05 18:56:53] <%+MaybeWaveyDavey> @gwdinosaurs Good point. There's no trigger. It doesn't say "when QB deals damage to player, also hit PW"

[2023-01-05 18:57:25] <%+MarkChalice> I had a situation in a pro tour where my opp flat out told me that they were going to stall it to a draw if they were going to lose. It was a situation where winner made top 8 of the pro tour. I told this to the judges, they did nothing. I kept calling judges over because my opp was stalling, but by the time they came over to watch(like the 6th judge call) it was too late. This was before they added the 5 additional turns. so frustrating.
[2023-01-05 18:57:44] <+joemama8630> how is it not enough

[2023-01-05 18:58:48] <+gwdinosaurs> @gwdinosaurs i guess not at comp rel, but it still seems scummy that the judge would watch both players miss the trigger and not say anything and immediately rule that the borderline cheating they just witnessed was legit

[2023-01-05 18:59:12] <%+MarkChalice> @FourDogsInAHorseSuit @kentuckyfri3d yeah, I know. It was the first Pro Tour Paris. I was going to win on my next turn too.

[2023-01-05 19:01:06] <armater> @DoubleCorvid even an ai wouldn't be able to, because there are many times where it's unclear priority is being held and opp is thinking about responding

[2023-01-05 19:01:14] <Nozdrum> DoubleCorvid judges tried clocks before, was super unfun and also lead to more angle shooting where people thought their opponent is tanking, but it was actually their clock being drained and the other side not saying anything etc
[2023-01-05 19:01:22] <%+MarkChalice> @Drexxie exactly. Taking the dice off is a clear message of "something is happening" and they did it during your turn; so it has to be something happened. total BS what happened to you.

[2023-01-05 19:11:03] <+viperfang_4> there's no point to black in that list, rend is not good compared to just running uw and playing march, i think uw control now plays the jeskai triome for PE and has a red card sb

[2023-01-05 19:49:19] <akaleth> Demon's Souls is a bit of a mess design-wise, but if you like any FromSoft games made since you'll probably enjoy it enough
[2023-01-05 19:49:24] <%riotboyjhin> the rough part can be the silver knight shooting an arrow and catching you in a frame trap on your roll. its rare but... it happens.

[2023-01-05 19:49:39] <armater> demons souls might be a little les janky control wise but it has a LOT of bugs
[2023-01-05 19:49:40] <+feyfroeg> demon's souls is less janky than dark souls, but also much less ambitious

[2023-01-05 20:11:59] <%riotboyjhin> advice for that portion. you can skip all the mobs, light the fire, main menu, and you'll come back to reset mobs. so you can kill necromancer safely.

[2023-01-05 20:42:00] <%riotboyjhin> isn't there a way to queue a run attack from a block animation so its an instant run attack
[2023-01-05 20:42:05] <+Dicho_v2> the thing nobody realizes is that Sif is literally just Athena, and everything in the Dark Souls world is real small

[2023-01-05 20:43:04] <%riotboyjhin> I am CERTAIN you can queue running attacks from block so you can instantly run attack. which is a more effective animation.
[2023-01-05 20:43:10] <%riotboyjhin> I just forget how
[2023-01-05 20:43:13] <armater> i think getting save states would help your practice a lot

[2023-01-05 20:44:51] <%riotboyjhin> Running Attack Hold Run while blocking, then stop running while continuing to hold L1. As long as you hold that block, you can save that running attack indefinitely, and when you press R1, it will be a running attack. Works with all weapons."
