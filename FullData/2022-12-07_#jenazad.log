[2022-12-07 13:24:57] <%whitefang363> charge attack is incredibly hard to dodge if you are close-mid range

[2022-12-07 13:25:02] <barald> you were playing so well there
[2022-12-07 13:25:06] <%termiest> The Colosseums of Limgrave, Caelid and Leyndell are now open.  In these arenas, players can engage in a variety of combat trials: one-on-one duels, free-for-alls & team battles up to six players, and special fights with spirit summoning enabled.

[2022-12-07 13:25:09] <%whitefang363> makes the fight very frustrating
[2022-12-07 13:25:42] <barald> maybe by staying more to the side of the boss ok
[2022-12-07 13:25:55] <barald> but then you cant get hits in on that sweet big head
