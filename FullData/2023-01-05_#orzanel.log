[2023-01-05 08:46:52] <zodmode> what do you think the biggest error is from the very good players is it rushing to a part of the map and then realizing they are alone and dying too soon?
[2023-01-05 08:47:21] <zodmode> one would think that if you are a good player and you realize that you are alone on a flank that you would fall back perhaps

[2023-01-05 09:47:53] <@^Nightbot> Very annoying light tank, view range is kinda low, speed is good, gun handling is good but has crappy salvo shot which ruins the tank entirely. Can only hit close stationary targets or you need to yolo and circle enemies. Overall not worth it.

[2023-01-05 11:43:09] <@%$superreiska> To be honest unless one goes to a trendy gym nobody looks at you (unless you're hot girl) after a first glance so no worries about that
[2023-01-05 11:43:23] <@%$superreiska> it's just ppl are self-conscious, especially if they are new to the gym
[2023-01-05 11:43:34] <+bechems> bodybuilding is actually very dangerous and can deteriorate your body as you age which turns out worse as if you didnt do extreme exercise keeping it tone is where its at
