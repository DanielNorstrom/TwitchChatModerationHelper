[2023-01-01 16:10:50] <+Wildfire_Gaming> my guild leaves it up to raiders, need if you need, so i've seen people on my token upgrade lfr and normal tokens to heroic, while i sit here with 0pc losing rolls
[2023-01-01 16:10:50] <reggiepowa> @scyne2020 it's about efficiently spreading gear so you can progress faster
[2023-01-01 16:11:00] <Pantist> for that you need reliable player, sadge
[2023-01-01 16:11:00] <+shweaterzz> i'd def prefer loot council
[2023-01-01 16:11:04] <@%Lv_ly> Chatting
[2023-01-01 16:11:07] <scyne2020> yeah but there is a difference betwen funeling to good players, or funeling to friends
[2023-01-01 16:11:07] <%Anelit21> True, you dont want new guy to get loot asap
[2023-01-01 16:11:13] <+shweaterzz> but we unfort have to let pugs in to fill our raid cause all my friends are casual
[2023-01-01 16:11:14] <%Limdaer> @Naguura I kinda dont like it, because our guild gives items based on ST dmg boosts... and moonkin.. oh well KEKW
[2023-01-01 16:11:25] <Sparklefartz> i find it mega Pepega that blizzard has us rolling on items in LFR again didnt we figure out this was a BAD fucking idea like 10 years ago?
[2023-01-01 16:11:25] <%nikolayyanev2> Did you decide what are you going to craft with your spark?
[2023-01-01 16:11:32] <Heartic97> Any progression guild should have loot council. Its smart
[2023-01-01 16:11:38] <HecticSpaniard> leave the guild friend :D
[2023-01-01 16:11:39] <%Anelit21> If you want to funnel friends, go raid with pugs KEKW
[2023-01-01 16:11:47] <scyne2020> yeah it is frustrating
[2023-01-01 16:11:49] <%+Coldv2> Loot council is best when used properly

[2023-01-01 16:32:28] <unrealforreal> They should just bring back Vengeance XD
[2023-01-01 16:32:28] <%Tenivir> people always take it to dumb extremes, noone thinks they should do no dmg and only threat
[2023-01-01 16:32:33] <flobbersuk> People dont play tanks based on how much damage they think they are going to do
[2023-01-01 16:32:36] <Orbitori> i would say if a tank does 50% dmg of a dd its ok
[2023-01-01 16:32:37] <%Tenivir> but why more than actual dmg dealer specs
[2023-01-01 16:32:41] <bloodbat007> well dps always has the advantage of burst cooldowns as well
[2023-01-01 16:32:43] <Shankaze> tanks are to tanky to be dealing the same dmg as a damage dealer. A tank should however be within 60-70% of a dmg dealer

[2023-01-01 16:33:26] <Orbitori> i do like 55% of the top dps in my group
[2023-01-01 16:33:26] <+Thedragonsenpai> warrior has also way bigger survivability than other tanks
[2023-01-01 16:33:27] <Calphurnious> That's also like saying one damage dealer shouldn't do more damage than another, that's just something that'll never happen with how they balance things
[2023-01-01 16:33:28] <+Zero0One1> well it would make sense if the tank with more dmg than the other take more dmg as well for example
[2023-01-01 16:33:29] <+Lostdogal> keep tanks strong or we all get rekt, rise up against tank nerfs lol
[2023-01-01 16:33:31] <zero_more> @Naguura depends gear i can say only
[2023-01-01 16:33:48] <innerkindd> WutFace
[2023-01-01 16:33:52] <%Tenivir> this is literally just tank players arguing that tanks should be top dps and other players saying it is over the top
[2023-01-01 16:33:53] <Trif0ld> if tanks do too much dmg then you can get to the point where raids stack 5+ tanks to skip mechanics
[2023-01-01 16:33:58] <MrAdonexus> they should be similar, one tank shouldn't be doing like 2x as much LUL
[2023-01-01 16:34:02] <Sparklefartz> you might not be able to balance WoW perfectly but a better job could be done KEKW

[2023-01-01 16:34:09] <+nevermarky> I think you should specify you mean overall damage for the dungeon, not pull to pull
[2023-01-01 16:34:17] <HybridWes> Now tanks hoping they only do 1% less damage than DPS if a nerf comes lol
[2023-01-01 16:34:21] <zero_more> @Naguura what u think about demo lock dps, its insane
[2023-01-01 16:34:23] <HairClog> Tanks need more mitigation but leas self heals. They should be soloing
[2023-01-01 16:34:42] <mothilium> i think ppl are just stupid or trolling you if they don't understand what you're saying :)-
[2023-01-01 16:34:43] <bloodbat007> @zero_more wait til you see what a demon hunter can do
[2023-01-01 16:34:43] <HairClog> Less*
[2023-01-01 16:34:46] <JaayLay> I say we buff tanks and return to 30 tank raid meta like 9.3 nyalotha

[2023-01-01 16:34:52] <Speshulist> yeah there should be literal tradeoffs.  battle stance to do more dps, but less dmg taken

[2023-01-01 17:26:57] <%Jacksprat47> correct, because it's smaller
[2023-01-01 17:26:57] <nimmw> air fryers filed my taxes, christened my first born child , cleaned my house and rescued my cat from a tree
[2023-01-01 17:26:57] <+IamWambo_> yes
[2023-01-01 17:26:58] <+razzman77> tastes better
[2023-01-01 17:27:01] <ravingmllf> no
[2023-01-01 17:27:01] <+razzman77> important diff
[2023-01-01 17:27:02] <+Ali0t> Modern ovens have the air option anyway
[2023-01-01 17:27:02] <+xlewi_c> and smaller and more efficient

[2023-01-01 17:27:04] <Ieetz0rR_> air fryer pizza Pog
[2023-01-01 17:27:04] <AgentPira> a *convection* oven specifically
[2023-01-01 17:27:04] <%stuatt83> its supposed to be healthier than normal frying, and uses less energy i think
[2023-01-01 17:27:05] <+DeadSlack> faster and doesnt produce as much grease on the foods
[2023-01-01 17:27:06] <Raybomber> You cant really cook huge pieces of meat there, for instance. It wont cook nicely.
[2023-01-01 17:27:06] <dedehousadia> its way healthier
[2023-01-01 17:27:07] <@%itsClubby> in the time it would take to explain ive already cooked my dinner
[2023-01-01 17:27:07] <Jarlan23> it does make things more crispy tbh
[2023-01-01 17:27:07] <hasaki2k16> it's smalle you can't cook a lot
[2023-01-01 17:27:08] <+drowesso> makes tings crispier

[2023-01-01 17:27:10] <+DeadSlack> healthier foods
[2023-01-01 17:27:12] <+goodwin801> and uses less electrÃ­city
[2023-01-01 17:27:12] <+xlewi_c> theyre tiny hahah
[2023-01-01 17:27:15] <+BigTrixian> it makes thing crispier without oil
[2023-01-01 17:27:15] <+JaxThaRippa> it literally turns your food into gold
[2023-01-01 17:27:16] <goldengrubate> An air fryer is just a countertop oven. Its faster and more convenient just because it's smaller
[2023-01-01 17:27:20] <@%Lv_ly> @Kaelangg sorry you have to experience the being ignored by our streamer mode at the first day of the year KEKW
[2023-01-01 17:27:20] <%+Kaelangg> you can do so much stuff in it though
[2023-01-01 17:27:22] <ravingmllf> it doesnt, people dont know whats up xD
[2023-01-01 17:27:22] <+GGunni> you dont have to warm it up 30min before using it
[2023-01-01 17:27:23] <+TheunGaming> it's the size of a microwave
[2023-01-01 17:27:23] <$toshiakalol> its nice for fries
[2023-01-01 17:27:23] <+LilarcorBR> you can just place it in your oven
[2023-01-01 17:27:24] <fishcakelive> you should replace your oven with an oven that can air fry as well
[2023-01-01 17:27:25] <+NAJuantheDon> it makes it crispy. french fries in an oven =/= french fries in an air fryer
[2023-01-01 17:27:26] <+CAVE401MAN> they are about size of coffee maker
[2023-01-01 17:27:28] <%$m0ezy> imo it replaces a mircowave, if u dont need that - thats fine
[2023-01-01 17:27:28] <HawtDaawwgg> but they are good for space LULW
[2023-01-01 17:27:28] <+captivate7> yeah its nice you don't have to use oil for certain things you want to cook
[2023-01-01 17:27:29] <bullxrush> they are usually really small - you can put them on like a counter

[2023-01-01 17:27:31] <ZeroSugarGod7> air fryer is amazing no oil cooking
[2023-01-01 17:27:32] <+EnhaZappe> Buy air frying and put it in oven so it fries air while it fries air Kappa
[2023-01-01 17:27:33] <+DHed91> a lot more energy efficient than oven
[2023-01-01 17:27:33] <+geros2013> also easier to clean I think. but tbh I never cook so my facts are questionable
[2023-01-01 17:27:35] <@%Lv_ly> naguuraLUL
[2023-01-01 17:27:37] <sownys> it's the same as a convection oven....it's not the same as a non convection oven
[2023-01-01 17:27:40] <Braumybrawl> also a million times cheaper
[2023-01-01 17:27:40] <Forcedgj> new ovens have airfryers built in now
[2023-01-01 17:27:42] <+SilkMaster> Put the air fryer in your oven.. ez
[2023-01-01 17:27:43] <%LukasasPlays> its more efficient because it dont heat a big space to get something done
[2023-01-01 17:27:44] <Peqdevil> mine is like a convetion oven, I can make steaks in mine
[2023-01-01 17:27:48] <+DeadSlack> its not just more convienient it makes the food healthier lol with less grease and time
[2023-01-01 17:27:49] <+Randallmoore95> I hope Taliesin and Evitel got one for their house warming
[2023-01-01 17:27:51] <+formation2252> Sell the oven

[2023-01-01 17:27:58] <+NAJuantheDon> its like a tall toaster. but slightly bigger
[2023-01-01 17:28:01] <%+Kaelangg> Naguura if your boyfriends mom would've air fryed those mussels last night you'd have liked them - reason 1
[2023-01-01 17:28:02] <lordmolox> 10?
[2023-01-01 17:28:04] <+Bboyhughes> you dont get it, the air fryer is a symbol that you are better than the mere oven dwelling households and you have acended to a higher form of life and cooking

[2023-01-01 18:03:28] <%+RizGritz> Biggest bene for Air Fryer to me, is not cleaning up the oil for anything requiring deep frying - not to mention health benefit (one spoon of oil versus a whole pan). Everything elese, yes, any other standard heating tool in the kitchen works fine lol

[2023-01-01 18:36:07] <@%^StreamElements> Naguura is the first healer I have seen so far who actually understands her role and is good. She understands that a healer's task is to HEAL, which is why the role name is HEALER. She never deals any damage, because she is not a DAMAGE DEALER role. Hopefully the rest of the healers will catch onto that.

[2023-01-01 19:51:32] <%+DanyKR98> @Kuroz thanks for answering! although it's sooo weird playstyle isn't it? naguuraMonkaS
[2023-01-01 19:51:37] <reactionnnnn7> ty
[2023-01-01 19:51:37] <+PatheticFBS> Is this the worst WoW expansion to date?
[2023-01-01 19:51:50] <%heavanna> Thanks for clarifying @Kuroz <3
[2023-01-01 19:52:02] <+PatheticFBS> Or better than shadowlands
[2023-01-01 19:52:14] <%heavanna> Tbh I'm here for it, I think it makes the rotation feel a little more fluid. But it's definitely counterintuitive XD
[2023-01-01 19:52:21] <Nodontstop> @PatheticFBS think its better than SL imo
[2023-01-01 19:52:25] <+thhanatos> everything is better than SL
[2023-01-01 19:52:26] <%+FafferUK> @PatheticFBS no but that's the worst opinion i've seen in a while
[2023-01-01 19:52:27] <maenkins> @PatheticFBS is shadowlands in the running?
[2023-01-01 19:52:27] <+ImSoBizarre> dragonflights great
[2023-01-01 19:52:32] <%+rjhenator> it is miles better than the last two
[2023-01-01 19:52:32] <%Zantia> easily the best expac since wrath
[2023-01-01 19:52:32] <%+Alcalines> I like it
[2023-01-01 19:52:34] <KohioDotA2> dragonflight is great
[2023-01-01 19:52:35] <Fharli> It's definitely better than Shadowlands and BfA
[2023-01-01 19:52:35] <gdzie_jest_wojtyla> the biggest issue is the gold requirement to do stuff
[2023-01-01 19:52:37] <steelkewl> I almost didnt buy dragonflight cuz of how much I hated shadowlands
[2023-01-01 19:52:37] <%warryvibe> I think most people like it more thanSL
[2023-01-01 19:52:37] <%+TypsyTurtle95> dragonflight is awesome so far, I like it a lot
[2023-01-01 19:52:37] <Nodontstop> its something different for sure
[2023-01-01 19:52:38] <+nokhi1992> What do you think of the current state of mm hunter? @Naguura
[2023-01-01 19:52:42] <Eveala> ofc its still new but feel like most find it better
[2023-01-01 19:52:45] <%matt_xiv> I like it alot but tbh I hate alot of the new dungeons
[2023-01-01 19:52:48] <+Qtrixx> does the vengeance stream?
[2023-01-01 19:52:49] <habitsxd> are you not running UE? ive had trouble casting wrath in lunar with UE and still spending procs on SF

[2023-01-01 19:53:11] <+vachito1> I rly prefered BFa dungeons but the pvp is in a good state now, just they need to do something for shuffles qâs
[2023-01-01 19:53:17] <%iPerspective> I have negative emotions every time I roll my key into a DF dungeon which is a problem for me but I like all the legacy ones
[2023-01-01 19:53:18] <+thhanatos> @gdzie_jest_wojtyla thats not even remotely true
[2023-01-01 19:53:21] <%Anelit21> @NilocAfterDark HOW DARE YOU SAY THAT D:
[2023-01-01 19:53:21] <curse5554> it's rare seeing her play on weekend
[2023-01-01 19:53:24] <%Zantia> yeah boomy is awfull in low keys :<
[2023-01-01 19:53:27] <+vachito1> Class tuning is ok too
[2023-01-01 19:53:28] <%heavanna> Dragonflight pulled me back into the game after being real sure I was forever done after BFA

[2023-01-01 19:53:30] <%+DanyKR98> @heavanna I hate casting starfire on ST so I'm glad we spam wrath but on aoe feels kinda strange for me xD
[2023-01-01 19:53:31] <+PatheticFBS> @fafferuk it was kind of a question not an opinion interesting outtake
[2023-01-01 19:53:39] <+JeriChicks> does she have 4 set?
[2023-01-01 19:53:48] <@%Kuroz> she does
[2023-01-01 19:53:50] <+Tyiralp> ask her
[2023-01-01 19:53:50] <%+DanyKR98> Maybe with the 10.5 rework things will change tho, we will see naguuraSip
[2023-01-01 19:53:58] <+Zagashi> yeah it's a solid expac so far
[2023-01-01 19:53:58] <+JeriChicks> ah so poggers. makes big dam increase in keys
[2023-01-01 19:54:00] <+NilocAfterDark> @Anelit21 hate me for speaking the truth :P
[2023-01-01 19:54:17] <+thhanatos> confused on how wrath would be better even in aoe, when every top boomkin on council is casting it
[2023-01-01 19:54:18] <%Anelit21> @NilocAfterDark dude professions are love, they finally have depth , what do you mean
[2023-01-01 19:54:25] <CarneiosTV> Have you done a higher Nokhuud yet? We had a rough time with it, but wondered how it was with talented players.

[2023-01-01 19:57:37] <alectheacrobat> Hey Naguura! When you're setting up on a pull do you think there's more value in sending all 3 wild mushrooms to get several starfalls going, or maximizing wild mushroom uptime to keep waning twighlight?
[2023-01-01 19:57:39] <CarneiosTV> That's pretty optimistic.
