[2023-01-02 00:57:05] <timoren> is this blitzcrank over camille? or doesnt matter because it will be leblanc/soraka anyway?

[2023-01-02 01:06:31] <%scottballa> i like the concept of hero augments but they influence the game way too much rn
[2023-01-02 01:06:36] <pureroo> kinda sad this set released in almost newyears so they are not patching for a while
[2023-01-02 01:06:42] <Fuldrer> maybe change it so only hero augments for units you have on board or bench
[2023-01-02 01:06:42] <+voidle_NA> problem is that they're not fine tuned to be close to each other in augment choices. some are just far above the rest it's not fair.

[2023-01-02 01:13:00] <@%undlek> haiiii peepoSitHey
[2023-01-02 01:13:11] <%Brotoloigos> I grew up being the son of a single mother. I was verbally abused throughout all my childhood for just trying to be a child. Things were hard and I'm sure she did her best. When I turned 18 I left my home and after a couple of years I learned that my mom had died in a traffic accident. I was never able to tell her that I don't blame her. Now whenever you are streaming and you start yelling you remind me of the best days that I had with my mom and how she used to treat me. Thank you Emily.

[2023-01-02 01:23:04] <!%+nelstrider> @LazloHo velkoz works but hacker loses to yuumi 3 unless it's EoN carry because yuumi projectile oneshots the hacker while aiming for something else and your carry just dies
[2023-01-02 01:23:45] <+LazloHo> there are lots of stuns in the game now actually
[2023-01-02 01:23:56] <+LazloHo> I don't know, I see a Yuumi in top 4 usually but I rarely see it win anymore
[2023-01-02 01:24:05] <!%+nelstrider> Depends on what elo you play
[2023-01-02 01:24:18] <+LazloHo> I only play it if I get a 2-1 aug or just a metric ton of the units early
[2023-01-02 01:24:19] <!%+nelstrider> Higher elo will not hold hands bot 4 as 3-4 yuumi players
[2023-01-02 01:24:32] <!%+nelstrider> So when you see a yuumi player it's mostly uncontested
[2023-01-02 01:24:34] <!%+nelstrider> And often a 1st

[2023-01-02 01:25:56] <!%+nelstrider> @LazloHo Like I said it depends on your rank, vertical duelists is usually a top 4 comp but rarely a first
[2023-01-02 01:25:56] <+LazloHo> gah, I don't know but Anima is really terrible
[2023-01-02 01:26:01] <myldspice> you have to play a lot of dead units

[2023-01-02 01:28:45] <+LazloHo> the advice I've since heard is that you can go up to 5 Anima for a while, or even hit 7 for a moment, but just to rack up numbers and then go back to 3 for end-game

[2023-01-02 16:00:26] <+k3mutant> its for sure 7
[2023-01-02 16:00:26] <%armshott> it depends on the HP also
[2023-01-02 16:00:27] <samme22g> It's for higher 3 cost chance
[2023-01-02 16:00:28] <iejundt> the guys just said that miss wang has the best gameplay ever and gets banned PogO
[2023-01-02 16:00:28] <haihai_24> arent odds better at 7

[2023-01-02 16:00:40] <tamaumu> He is limit testing
[2023-01-02 16:00:41] <!%+Reveritie> Shruge it's 35 gold which is 70 gold with golden ticket
[2023-01-02 16:00:46] <Goredrum> no way
[2023-01-02 16:00:46] <%+mannyorsonny> the tempo in China is so insane.
[2023-01-02 16:00:47] <bratwurstbernhard> High end shopping?
[2023-01-02 16:00:48] <+masarusasaki> weird
[2023-01-02 16:00:49] <Goredrum> you're lying.
[2023-01-02 16:00:57] <+TheNoggin> PogO
[2023-01-02 16:00:58] <samme22g> If you roll at 7, the chances to get 3 costs are diluted by higher cost units
[2023-01-02 16:00:59] <%rtsRANGEL> It might be because lobby takes a lot by the time you get 7?
[2023-01-02 16:00:59] <+marvinleonbutlerii> Yeah you're not hitting hsit
[2023-01-02 16:01:00] <Ziggy_Buckets> I guess the gold for the 5% is less valuable than just rolling to spike board early?
[2023-01-02 16:01:02] <+KonanKohai> Hey Emily and chat! Hope your holidays were good <3 konankJAM

[2023-01-02 19:49:31] <Rapidfuryy> To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Teamfight Tactics. The intricacies of combat are extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of Wangjitsu, most of the fights will leave those unprepared, dead and frustrated. There‚Äôs also the stealth aspects, which are deftly woven into the gameplay - this tactical approach draws heavily from Sun Tzu‚Äôs ‚ÄúArt of War‚Äù, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to appreciate Emily's gameplay.
