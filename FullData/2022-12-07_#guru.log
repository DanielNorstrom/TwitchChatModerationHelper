[2022-12-07 12:49:14] <Jarcow0w> why they didnt make AOE block so we can delete rein from the game KEKW
[2022-12-07 12:49:18] <+Sica> ggss

[2022-12-07 12:49:51] <warmbottom> People so toxic in comp
[2022-12-07 12:50:00] <%+NuFrontier> Yeah Ramattra really needs to stay with his supports more often than not, to play that strong poke game

[2022-12-07 12:50:12] <notgoot> @GURU is he OP in an unfun kind of way tho?
[2022-12-07 12:50:14] <+adum_bomb> Sojourn headshot multiplier from 2 to 1.5 yo
[2022-12-07 12:50:14] <@%^StreamElements> yo x22267
[2022-12-07 12:50:15] <%talon824> @adum_bomb And rail has 1.5x headshot multiplier, plus her ult has 20% faster charge speed
[2022-12-07 12:50:42] VIEWERS: 4 555
[2022-12-07 12:50:51] <+adum_bomb> @talon824 omg she did NOT NEED a faster ult charge wtf
[2022-12-07 12:50:58] <%+NuFrontier> what maps do you favor Ram most on @GURU ?
[2022-12-07 12:51:07] <%talon824> @adum_bomb Not faster ult charge, her rail charges faster in ult now
[2022-12-07 12:51:11] <Richie364> not faster at charging ult, but her right click charges 20% quicker while ult is enabled
[2022-12-07 12:51:21] <+adum_bomb> Ohhhhh ok ty, so scarier ult
[2022-12-07 12:51:26] <axidzz> his snare feels like kinda meh
[2022-12-07 12:51:32] <Richie364> well technically she will generate ult quicker with 10% primary fire dmg buff too @adum_bomb
[2022-12-07 12:51:39] <%talon824> @adum_bomb To compensate for not oneshotting without mercypocket
[2022-12-07 12:51:40] <NimbusTheBad> Don’t forget guys the progress for the skin doesn’t count until you’ve claimed the spray!
[2022-12-07 12:51:52] <%patthecatguy> not the wub pocket
[2022-12-07 12:52:00] <Richie364> @NimbusTheBad theres an autoclaim extension on chrome btw
[2022-12-07 12:52:01] <+adum_bomb> Why do I feel like SOJORUN DISRPUTeR better than Rama cage
[2022-12-07 12:52:12] <Richie364> rama cage is 99% useless
[2022-12-07 12:52:22] <%talon824> @adum_bomb …because it kind of is
[2022-12-07 12:52:25] <%Waizer> I'd love to hear those comms now that wub and slater have swapped

[2022-12-07 12:53:15] <+Guts72> E gives just enough time to slow and kill people
[2022-12-07 12:53:17] <zourns> i thought ramattra was disabled on competitive
[2022-12-07 12:53:21] <+inferno___o> still need to get used to his punch range feels like it should be slightly longer idk if its the visual or what

[2022-12-07 13:45:25] <%pogjoni> Guru the Newgen Overwatch player just bought Midas from the Shop
[2022-12-07 13:45:56] <+SamuraiShaf> @stilltoffee the hitbox is so much bigger, armor now affects self heal so 1.25x healing doesn't mean shit against tanks. it's actually worse than the original 1x heal. Blade recall is now curved and hits less ppl most of the time
[2022-12-07 13:46:12] <%+fredtheboatt> Is it me or all mercy mains sound the same

[2022-12-07 13:47:03] <+SimoneMrg> @SamuraiShaf The curve is just a change, neither a buff nor a nerf, and the bleed is buffed on 4 people and nerfed on 1, it's still overall better
[2022-12-07 13:47:13] <WASTEFEST> The system kinda blows

[2022-12-07 13:47:48] <+Chawizaud> @WASTEFEST yeah and they shut down ow1 so u cant just grind out skins in that game. its pretty toxic ngl
[2022-12-07 13:47:54] <+SamuraiShaf> @simonemrg the change affects more than you think. you'll miss a lot of recall heal procs. 90% of the time the tank is in your face and has armor so it's a nerf.

[2022-12-07 13:48:59] <+SimoneMrg> @SamuraiShaf You'll also hit recall procs that you would have missed before, that's my point. Also you usually want to avoid shooting the tank anyways, and the meta is Hog Doom and neither have Armor
[2022-12-07 13:48:59] <%Momo555> why is every junk player so fucking irritating
