[2022-12-17 00:13:37] <%AslanGrants> lots of water, but probably easiest to colonize
[2022-12-17 00:13:41] <%AslanGrants> Titan has polar ice, iirc
[2022-12-17 00:13:44] <%AslanGrants> more rocks, more ore

[2022-12-17 00:13:57] <+britishlad279> i think europa has ice because in destiny 2 you go to europa and its all ice
[2022-12-17 00:14:03] <%KaiSakurai> i only played the first subnautica
[2022-12-17 00:14:25] <%KaiSakurai> made the mistake of leaving the map area... shat bricks when i realised 3 ghost leviathans chasing me...

[2022-12-17 00:14:27] <demonic_tangelo> yeah they said europa has liquid water because of tidal forces heating it up right?
[2022-12-17 00:14:34] <%KaiSakurai> didnt make it back onto map area alive...
[2022-12-17 00:14:43] <%AslanGrants> if there's liquid water, it's closer to the bottom
[2022-12-17 00:14:45] <yaebidjolten> Europa is the Ice moon with the nearly mile long ice sheet on the surface and titan is a methane moon.

[2022-12-17 00:28:15] <Elohunt> Imo we should either trap aliens on their planets or exterminate them because we don't know the mentality of their species and lifeforms on planets are pretty vulnerable.

[2022-12-17 00:31:11] <%AslanGrants> If this kinda stuff is your vibe, there's a channel out there called Science and Futurism with Isaac Arthur, he does a lot of both introductory and advanced discussions on some pretty out there topics, like the Fermi Paradox, future methods of power generation, and the like
[2022-12-17 00:31:27] <%AslanGrants> The Great Filter theory is a supposed answer to the Fermi Paradox, not a part of it.
[2022-12-17 00:31:33] <%$catfromavoid> What if there is other life forms but they are so different that we just can’t perceive each other? At least not visibly. That would explain any paranormal activity

[2022-12-17 22:51:02] <%$LederIappen> Shooter Movements are evlolving backwards in my opinion, we went from aggressive games where you can push anything you want, to everybody sitting in a god dang corner and not moving
