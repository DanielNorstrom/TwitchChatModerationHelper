He *loved* food, and the horrid part was, because he also totally lost his sense of taste, he overate to an unhealthy amount and got really unhealthy weight-wise.

[2022-12-19 01:37:08] <TitanSlayer640> yES
[2022-12-19 01:37:08] <%eveningmaster> Yes, he is...
[2022-12-19 01:37:08] <%robinthebobbin99> Yeah
[2022-12-19 01:37:12] <!VtuberTalk> Yes.
[2022-12-19 01:37:12] <%Yggy_Ch> he's such a cptdandyClown
[2022-12-19 01:37:12] <Purrbrad> What?
[2022-12-19 01:37:14] <%ultimateheroduh> he's doing the poll, he will 1000% ignore it if it says "yes"
[2022-12-19 01:37:14] <%epsilonremixes> it's a real poll
[2022-12-19 01:37:20] <Tekkame_Ando> yes, and he's loosing
[2022-12-19 01:37:20] <boikaiba> i been having a bad day today, seeing you stream cheered me up
[2022-12-19 01:37:21] <Starrhop> What? amedolNani
[2022-12-19 01:37:21] <@%AfroSquirrel> and then tweeted "BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU WISH FOR"
[2022-12-19 01:37:39] <%robinthebobbin99> He probably wants to get out and put some other asshole in it
[2022-12-19 01:37:41] <%godworrior1> "yes" is winning by almost 16 points
[2022-12-19 01:37:42] <%Yggy_Ch> it just confirms even more to me that he never actually wanted to buy twitter, but forgot that his actions do indeed have consequences mintyy4Kekw
[2022-12-19 01:37:48] <%GojiGoro> get to those polls, chat :)
[2022-12-19 01:37:52] <%ResidentLune> "I'm doing my part!"
[2022-12-19 01:37:56] <!VtuberTalk> Speculation is that he expects to be 'voted out' and that it's a play to leave so the Tesla stock will stop tanking without him looking like he chose to step down.
[2022-12-19 01:37:57] <%SpitfireGunner> SORRY DUMB ASS BUT YOUR ASKING US TO GET RID OF YOU I THINK YES PLEASE

[2022-12-19 01:39:29] <%Yggy_Ch> He never wanted to buy twitter. He made a joke and took it too far. He's an idiot. Twitter is too big and now too important to fail. Someone else will take over. The idiot's down 44 billion bucks. You love to see it
[2022-12-19 01:39:40] <machacha_fulgrim> she wants to yell at us shes live in discord inkkZOOM

[2022-12-19 02:37:25] <%eveningmaster> I think the Linktree issue is they don't want to check all the aggregate sites for people posting the banned links 1 layer removed
[2022-12-19 02:37:27] <%MelkorTheGreat> Something about building walls
[2022-12-19 02:37:28] <%Yggy_Ch> "Any site that blocks you out of competitors is the wrong side"
