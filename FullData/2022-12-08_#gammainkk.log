[2022-12-08 13:13:18] <fm_productions> @Henrique_Kori For modelling: There are usually 2 types, either you use rigging, so eyes can move with bones, but usually you use blend shapes, so you have sliders that deform the mesh. There is a third type too, you can switch eye textures based on the selected expressions, so eyes are drawn as textures applied to the part of the face that has the eye area

[2022-12-08 13:17:33] <fm_productions> @Henrique_Kori I don't have much experience with modelling from source, but I've seen how some models are usually done. There is a regular eye texture. But faces and eyes often use many blend shapes. I have also seen some shapes where the mesh is hidden behind the eye and if you enable the shape, it brings it to the foreground and shows a custom eye texture. I think you could search for some vrchat models, get or buy the source file and inspect how they do stuff too
[2022-12-08 13:17:38] <fm_productions> as a good way to learn how they do it

[2022-12-08 14:35:28] <fm_productions> @BlondieSea If you have a model like gamma, and you purchase an outfit made for that model, it's easy, but if you try to take an outfit of a different model it is harder. Then you usually need to edit the outfit in a 3d application and you have to skin/rig it to the armature of the character model you want to use
[2022-12-08 14:35:47] <%BlondieSea> oh my thats so easy!

And for VRChat there are also requirements to achieve full body tracking

[2022-12-08 14:53:12] <fm_productions> I wanna learn blender too, will probably start with a udemy course I got a while ago. But I often just don't stick with courses and abandon them after a few parts

[2022-12-08 14:55:19] <%$itsbfginnit> Oh it was pretty hectic, but it's all fine now. Relaxing to you freaking out at Blender is just what I needed KEKW
[2022-12-08 14:55:42] <fm_productions> Oh btw, does it work for you to double click an fbx file in Unity and blender opens it? It didn't work for me but I recently made a small unity script to help to do that

[2022-12-08 14:59:18] <fm_productions> if you double click the model file in Unity, it usually tries to open blender for me and crashes
[2022-12-08 14:59:31] <fm_productions> So i have to open bender regularly and do "Import FBX" instead
