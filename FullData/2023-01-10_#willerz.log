[2023-01-10 19:43:28] <Bosikkk> @WillerZ why 8/10 raids there are just shotgun timmies everywhere

[2023-01-10 19:43:37] <%xxxxkrypticxxxx> my first raid lastnight was a creditcard man and it was on customs

[2023-01-10 19:43:41] <%+alpacacheese> Clip it
[2023-01-10 19:43:41] <%biggj9087> I’ve had a few sus encounters. One was on lighthouse but wasn’t sure if it was desync or not
[2023-01-10 19:43:42] <%+VivaLaChad> Why are there so many hackers this wipe??
[2023-01-10 19:43:43] <@^Nightbot> why not?
[2023-01-10 19:43:46] <+soggysinner> and his movement was ass, but his aim was godlike lol.
[2023-01-10 19:43:46] <%$yomabloodd> he was shooting through the green glass that you cant see at all
[2023-01-10 19:43:46] <%BioshineGaming> If you’re not legit then I’ve been wrong for over a year
[2023-01-10 19:43:48] <%+drduck1027> wall hack but no aim bot
[2023-01-10 19:43:54] <%Playermodd> @captainfllntlock yea if you are sus im reporting idc about what account you have

[2023-01-10 19:43:57] <JohnnyFragz> is Bruce getting unlucky or cheated
[2023-01-10 19:43:58] <mugiwarachemz> i feel like customs has all the cheaters
[2023-01-10 19:43:59] <%Drohza> willerGATOR willerGATOR willerGATOR willerGATOR
[2023-01-10 19:43:59] <IDeliriuml> why would you brag about using cheats LUL some people really have no pride in themselves
[2023-01-10 19:44:05] <ShiGuyGaming> @Willerz do you think its better for me to keep doing night raids to try and get my tasks done or should i go more day raids to get better at pvp
[2023-01-10 19:44:05] <%$QcDragonz> Hey will, do you think BAttlestate actually does something when we repport cheaters ?
[2023-01-10 19:44:07] <%aDroniaK> Do they still have that cheat where they suck all the loot up from a long distance?
[2023-01-10 19:44:08] <CellTank> "I'm not legit bro" is what I heard from that, could be mistaken though
[2023-01-10 19:44:09] <+captainfllntlock> @Playermodd facts
[2023-01-10 19:44:13] <%+sickmovement> @WillerZ what do you think the best way to take care of the cheating problem would be?
[2023-01-10 19:44:15] <%$yomabloodd> @drduck1027 he had aimlock too, but bullets are not hitscan bro
[2023-01-10 19:44:16] <%MrRJ_> @whiskycharliejr Because the entire bsg team is working just ammo balancing danexeGotem
[2023-01-10 19:44:17] <+whiskycharliejr> but ammo needs balancing lmao
[2023-01-10 19:44:17] <+DJSRP> banwave where
[2023-01-10 19:44:20] <%JDiamatti> Pathetic excuse for a life form if you cheat in video games sorry not sorry.
[2023-01-10 19:44:24] <%aDroniaK> I remember going into reserve and opening up locked rooms where all the loot is missing
[2023-01-10 19:44:29] <fogkingcro> @johnnyfragz cheat my friend
[2023-01-10 19:44:30] <Akozron> @jdiamatti YEP
[2023-01-10 19:44:31] <%+Kryubi> How do they profit from cheating or is it just to stroke their epeen?
[2023-01-10 19:44:40] <fogkingcro> cheat kill
[2023-01-10 19:44:46] <%snicklefritzthagawd> @sickmovement the obvious right answer is to make you enter a cell phone number and you cant use voip /s
[2023-01-10 19:44:49] <%BioshineGaming> Balancing and patches are not part of the security team
[2023-01-10 19:44:55] <sleepykinns> This music is sick
[2023-01-10 19:44:56] <+DannyMans> IMO non-EoD accounts and EoD alike make up the players who hack in this game.  I chuckle when people tell me if it's EoD its good chance they aren't cheaters
[2023-01-10 19:44:56] <%BioshineGaming> Two completely different teams
[2023-01-10 19:45:01] <+whiskycharliejr> security team is asss!
[2023-01-10 19:45:04] <Bosikkk> @Kryubi profit a lot by boosting / sellig shit / sherpa cheater clearing raid etc
[2023-01-10 19:45:06] <RoadsignCheems> @Kryubi 50% stroke their ego 50% get gear and sell it for profit (rmt)
[2023-01-10 19:45:07] <%JDiamatti> @Akozron Is it harsh? eh. who cares LUL its truth

[2023-01-10 19:45:26] <%+Kryubi> @Kryubi ah ok that makes sense.
[2023-01-10 19:45:29] <%Shooktd> i wonder if they can implement some shit like cod did. where when they shoot is does no damage, or it autolocks to dummies etc
[2023-01-10 19:45:29] <%flushinit> Just murdered some thicccc bois as a scav on streets. loot is fucking fire
[2023-01-10 19:45:36] <+whiskycharliejr> i miss when they just lab spammd and left us alone

[2023-01-10 19:45:43] <%curlyfriesncoke1> guys no matter what game there will be cheaters. just gotta get over it and move on dont let it ruin your day. yes i hate the fuckers too but gotta stay positive<3
[2023-01-10 19:45:44] <%+baldbeardedbam> @Kryubi they take the easy road because they can't...can't do anything legit.   0 skill.  They got pooped on so much they just gave up.

[2023-01-10 19:46:09] <coconutsunrise69> Do you think cheating is more or less of an issue this wipe? I've only seen 1 cheater so far

[2023-01-10 19:46:21] <%aDroniaK> I do not think there are more cheaters this wipe. Every wipe is bad
[2023-01-10 19:46:23] <%0MaG> Someone in a raid earlier was telling me that cheater's are ammo farming now and selling cases of it
[2023-01-10 19:46:33] <PostwarPizza> nothing was done about the cheating
[2023-01-10 19:46:37] <%snicklefritzthagawd> @sickmovement i was kind of kidding, you can just buy sim cards with numbers for like pennies.. i dont know if there is a way to fix it but actually make good games without exploit hooks in them

[2023-01-10 19:50:55] <%snicklefritzthagawd> see yall are missing the thing, the cheaters are the real customers, not us
[2023-01-10 19:51:01] <%+stribbits> BSG sells the cheats, thats why its the only way they keep getting $ why do u think there are ban waves... to make the cheaters buy gain
[2023-01-10 19:51:04] <%+SumYungGui> agreed
[2023-01-10 19:51:06] <%lunchness> The key use just screwed so many people

[2023-01-10 19:51:19] <%aDroniaK> games should embrace that. ez way for them to get a cut by directing traffic through them....
[2023-01-10 19:51:25] <WaldPerks> I feel like there was less cheaters before tagged and cursed and the RMT restrictions

[2023-01-10 19:51:29] <%+thatguymarcel> BSG doesnt sell cheats bruh
[2023-01-10 19:51:33] <%+zootuhh> wassup
[2023-01-10 19:51:37] <PostwarPizza> could they have more anti-cheat admies?
[2023-01-10 19:51:39] <%+TheOnlyHabibi> alot of stupid chatter in this chat right now
[2023-01-10 19:51:45] <bogvandi1> whats a good map for a money run
[2023-01-10 19:51:46] <schwabbyy> is the sr-2m worth using if I don't have the top ammo
[2023-01-10 19:51:50] <%xxxxkrypticxxxx> if they sold the cheats then they need to put all those accounts in theri own matchmaking
[2023-01-10 19:51:58] <%snicklefritzthagawd> they have an incentive to ban the cheaters then let them back on with a new account
[2023-01-10 19:52:01] <%BioshineGaming> The best answer is kernel level drivers but we saw how the public reacted when call of duty announced their kernel security. Doubtful people would let a Russian company into their files that deep
[2023-01-10 19:52:03] <%+SumYungGui> @thatguymarcel they dont sell the cheats but the cheaters buy more games ever time they get offed
[2023-01-10 19:52:03] <+bodash> After all the millenial/genz get into gov were gonna have to register to game and vote
[2023-01-10 19:52:06] <%+sickmovement> i get thtat theyre buying the most accounts but id like to think bsg has more integrity than that. if they just care about income over their community then this game is doomed
[2023-01-10 19:52:08] <theodpainter> do you know if d2 is still bugged ??
[2023-01-10 19:52:13] <%+rfarmer969> @WillerZ I think the best method in terms of effectiveness someone mentioned is that they take a hammer to the game and come back from ground 0 with something similar to valorant's dedicated Anti-Cheat since apparently that sort of anti-cheat isn't practical unless the game is somewhat made around the implementation.
[2023-01-10 19:52:15] <xvalkyrius> yeah bsg definitely make a lot of their money from cheaters
[2023-01-10 19:52:24] <%NotNatooli> aanyone see any fly cheaters yet
[2023-01-10 19:52:27] <%+asteroidblues__> battle eye is already kernal level
[2023-01-10 19:52:28] <+DJSRP> they should just move all cheaters to dedicated servers

[2023-01-10 19:52:41] <%+zootuhh> shadow ban the cheaters
[2023-01-10 19:52:44] <%flushinit> BSG needs to watch you poop, sure no problem LUL
[2023-01-10 19:52:52] <CellTank> BattleEye is already kernel level though....
[2023-01-10 19:52:59] <%flushinit> @CellTank no its not
[2023-01-10 19:52:59] <%BioshineGaming> You understand computers, most people hear that and lose their mind
[2023-01-10 19:52:59] <IDeliriuml> they should match all the cheaters against themselves LUL
[2023-01-10 19:53:02] <%JDiamatti> They can mine bitcoin off my GPU its fine. Fuck it
[2023-01-10 19:53:10] <%snicklefritzthagawd> battle eye is shit AC
[2023-01-10 19:53:13] <%$Toxikshade> @CellTank def not
[2023-01-10 19:53:16] <%+zootuhh> id be ok w a more intrusive anti cheat more similar to valorant tbh im willin cuz i dont cheat and i simply use my pc to game
[2023-01-10 19:53:18] <+soggysinner> get their ISP involved, so that if cheats are detected their internet is throttled to a hault
[2023-01-10 19:53:21] <%+asteroidblues__> @Toxikshade it actually is
[2023-01-10 19:53:23] <%NotNatooli> no shadow ban bsg should do a live stream of them just banning people like a hype train
[2023-01-10 19:53:24] <%0MaG> One of the things CSGO did at one point was you had to have an older account to play on prime. They could easily do that. Separate queue for accounts older than one month or something
[2023-01-10 19:53:26] <xvalkyrius> yeah I saw a level 53 with a 40 k/d lol

[2023-01-10 19:53:28] <CellTank> @CellTank Most certainly is. But okay keep thinking it isn't.
[2023-01-10 19:53:30] <%+thatguymarcel> will does your gym work? mine doesnt
[2023-01-10 19:53:30] <%xgon9> Does BSG use any kind of Anti - cheat? or just a report system?
[2023-01-10 19:53:31] <%XeuUK> @JDiamatti Tarkov might actually use some GPU then kekw
[2023-01-10 19:53:34] <%+thatguymarcel> its bugged as hell
[2023-01-10 19:53:35] <%+asteroidblues__> the issue is the way this game functions makes it incredibly easy to cheat.  Too much of the game is  client side authority
[2023-01-10 19:53:38] <+antelopeTV> who do you guys turn the quest into for chemical part 4? therpaist, prapor, or skier? i cant decide
[2023-01-10 19:53:40] <%bjkooch> @willerz it’s ok. I couldn’t sleep last night and I went 0-7 on my raids. Night boys are try hard af
[2023-01-10 19:53:42] <%SEAmonsta91> @BioshineGaming  Exactly. Kernel level is very invasive. The thing is though they dont need to do that. They could simply take one look at the flea market sellers, and ban those, then take another look at client-server interaction and figure out how to make it to where if a player's bullet trajectors or movement is abnormal it gets flagged for cheatuse
[2023-01-10 19:53:44] <0gb0bbyj0hnson> Tarkovs player base is too small to support the scope of the project so BSG just continues selling keys to 3rd party resellers so that they can get repeat buyers. The game has hamstringed it’s self by leaning into its niche appeal and lack of regard for the existing skill gap without cheaters. Which keeps new players from learning how to comfortably play the game, cutting the amount of monthly new players making the repeat 3rd party resellers keys bsg’s bread and butter.
[2023-01-10 19:53:45] <+tvggamezco> reminds me of The Crow
[2023-01-10 19:53:46] <bababoey04> No hate why do you scav?
[2023-01-10 19:53:51] <%GavTheMighty> Cheaters ruin it in any game one of the dumbest mentalities in modern society
[2023-01-10 19:53:56] <+DJSRP> @xvalkyrius how do you see KDs of people lol?
[2023-01-10 19:53:59] <%+stribbits> They will never get rid of cheaters they buy accounts
[2023-01-10 19:54:03] <juiced96> @0MaG i dont think throwing all new players together with the cheaters is a good idea
[2023-01-10 19:54:03] <%JDiamatti> @XeuUK true I love how so many people will run a fucking 4090 or some shit with an absolute dogmeat cpu+ram combination
[2023-01-10 19:54:04] <%flushinit> @WillerZ BRO THEY SHOULD PUT THE CHEATERS IN THEIR OWN SERVERS AND WE CAN WATCH THEM BATTLE IT OUT LUL
[2023-01-10 19:54:05] <%+drduck1027> because its fun
[2023-01-10 19:54:08] <%+zootuhh> i think the people scared of a more intrusive anti cheat are the people that do weird shit on there pc
[2023-01-10 19:54:13] <+tvggamezco> It's because streets is prob intimidating to new players and people want RMT
[2023-01-10 19:54:15] <%BioshineGaming> @xvalkyrius did you just accidentally admit to cheating since you can see kds?😂

[2023-01-10 19:54:17] <veoko_> battle eye catches copy paste cheats from years ago, anything made in the past year will evade it. i'm sure people would be fine w ring 0 anticheat like valorant, just rootkit me already

[2023-01-10 19:55:48] <%flushinit> @soggysinner its because they have a root kit on your pc, which is what we're talking about because of a russian game company having access to your pc, some people may be skeptical
[2023-01-10 19:55:50] <%drewwper> removing market?
[2023-01-10 19:55:54] <%BioshineGaming> Battle state needs to improve almost every aspect of this game at this point. Game performance, security, servers
[2023-01-10 19:55:58] <Eclipse6980> Do you get better SCAVS the higher you rank up
[2023-01-10 19:56:00] <+soggysinner> @asteroidblues__ i mean, im ascendant.. i thing thats pretty good for not seeing cheaters
[2023-01-10 19:56:01] <xvalkyrius> I think I've seen 1 cheater in over 5000 hours of league of legends OMEGALUL
[2023-01-10 19:56:08] <+tvggamezco> I don't think they know either, anything they try as far as making the game slower, removing ammo, high level equipment, etc, just makes things worse

[2023-01-10 19:57:43] <%+rfarmer969> The thing about BattleEye is that is is Kernel LEvel but it only starts and is active when the processes and services start (you start the game). The only difference Valorant has is that Vanguard is active on PC Startup but even then Valorant has had several in-game development choices to combat cheaters that aren't practical for titles not development to make use of them.. like it's a tailored solution that has a tailored product versus a generic solution (BattleEye)
[2023-01-10 19:57:44] <+captainfllntlock> Bsg will ban all the cheaters dont worry................. then run another sale KEKW

[2023-01-10 19:58:12] <%$Toxikshade> @asteroidblues__ kernel level is more common than i thought!
[2023-01-10 19:58:15] <%Playermodd> Runescape is a right of passage
[2023-01-10 19:58:16] <+soggysinner> @asteroidblues__ 100%. the stakes in EFT are way higher. It's harder to really tell if cheaters are there in valorant too.. no replay, one shot head shot, etc.
[2023-01-10 19:58:17] <Woodnhead> just got a reserve marked key, do i sell it or use :/

[2023-01-10 19:59:18] <%+asteroidblues__> @soggysinner yeah closet cheating with just walls is most common but you still see dudes spinning their ass off sometimes.  it just takes a long time to boost someone so if youre doing boost for profit its not super good return vs farming roubles in tarkov or doing carries for loot in a game like destiny etc.  this is why those games have higher cheater populations imo

[2023-01-10 20:01:43] <%+cgags14> my only complaint with this game is how much people just sit and beat off and never move
[2023-01-10 20:01:47] <CellTank> @e_b_a_h My SR is 40% lower this wipe so far due to trying to quest on EU shoreline, that shit is something else KEKW
[2023-01-10 20:01:49] <+shaqspeepee> @flushinit nah I was talking about the desync with the crazy 0 hit count
[2023-01-10 20:01:53] <%SEAmonsta91> No other games stay in beta for 4 years KEKW
[2023-01-10 20:01:57] <%+cgags14> I legit will run a whole map before people leave there spawn points
[2023-01-10 20:02:08] <+jaybospecial> are you having audio issues or is it just me ?
[2023-01-10 20:02:12] <+bodash> It would be cool if they implemented a moderation system like dayz has, per raid. Idk how to make it worth a persons time but you could chose from scav/mod/pmc in the selection screen.

[2023-01-10 21:16:31] <wambwamp> first ten mins are scuffed if they have a lot of scavs spawning in
[2023-01-10 21:16:33] <+bondoblast> it'll get better after you kill everybody ;)

[2023-01-10 21:16:46] <dinglebunguss> That’s for the men leak not the server rubberbanding
[2023-01-10 21:16:58] <theFecesphantom> its literally server end only. there's absolutely nothing that can be done to fix it on the player end.
[2023-01-10 21:17:03] <%+asteroidblues__> when it rubber bands like that it rubber bands for everyone in the server.
[2023-01-10 21:17:08] <caveBob64> mmaybe some servers are just extra cheeks
[2023-01-10 21:17:21] <%KrisstroniK> get 5 frames for each kill

[2023-01-10 21:17:27] <zzNaii> LOL
[2023-01-10 21:17:27] <+MrFlatClock> So i'm new here. These servers are filled with both bots and real players, right?
[2023-01-10 21:17:29] <%+Ageond> Yikes
[2023-01-10 21:17:32] <%S_mea_R> oh, so there ARE sparkplugs in the game. Wouldn't know, been looking for them for about 3 days
[2023-01-10 21:17:34] <peepohappy9> stuck in the matrix
[2023-01-10 21:17:35] <%fouldser> @asteroidblues__ thats bs i have been killed during rubberbands
[2023-01-10 21:17:39] <+hackshott> that's packet loss
[2023-01-10 21:17:41] <@%sushibarsamurai> @MrFlatClock correct
[2023-01-10 21:17:41] <hzk04> thats packetloss symbol i thought
[2023-01-10 21:17:46] <+Arknaado> @MrFlatClock yes, AI scavs, player scavs, and player PMCs
[2023-01-10 21:17:48] <caveBob64> @MrFlatClock if by bots you mean ai scavs then yeah
[2023-01-10 21:17:51] <+bondoblast> sure it's not a new feature?
[2023-01-10 21:17:54] <theFecesphantom> @asteroidblues__ doesnt stop bullets LUL

[2023-01-10 21:18:07] <+Att0msk> map is an absolute mess
[2023-01-10 21:18:09] <%bliss561> this map is so broken right now. cannot wait for a patch
[2023-01-10 21:18:13] <+hackshott> oh he tryin to extract lol
[2023-01-10 21:18:13] <+MrFlatClock> Thank you guys
[2023-01-10 21:18:15] <hzk04> crawl
[2023-01-10 21:18:18] <%bliss561> it would be cool if it was actually playable
[2023-01-10 21:18:19] <%+highplainsdrifter> damaged house is kinda close ot you
[2023-01-10 21:18:22] <%+dirtbikemx09> packet loss, is that our own network isue or is there more ping and packet loss issues this wipe on Tarkovs end??
[2023-01-10 21:18:22] <IDeliriuml> this map is really bad for lag. i get it every time i play streets
[2023-01-10 21:18:26] <%bucknasty_ttv> lol
[2023-01-10 21:18:26] <caveBob64> it plays better at night I've found SeemsGood
[2023-01-10 21:18:29] <ddraggbagg> Not gonna lie, this might be one of the worst servers I have seen for streets
[2023-01-10 21:18:30] <javier07cuellar> WutFace
[2023-01-10 21:18:33] <%+asteroidblues__> @fouldser just because they are rubber banding doesnt mean their guns dont shoot.  i met like 4 dudes on voip and all of use were rubber banding exact same times and i could see them teleporting on my screen
[2023-01-10 21:18:34] <%Shooktd> i really wish they would just fix their network bullshit across the board
[2023-01-10 21:18:35] <ddraggbagg> put this toaster down
[2023-01-10 21:18:38] <%+Kryubi> I wonder if it's when scavs are loading in
[2023-01-10 21:18:38] <%+redneckpat> 38 minutes to get there monkaEyes
[2023-01-10 21:18:43] <%Shooktd> hire a network engineer and fix their bs.
[2023-01-10 21:18:56] <+tvggamezco> the map will get better over time
[2023-01-10 21:19:04] <%+redneckpat> Jebaited
[2023-01-10 21:19:09] <@%$DrtyWash> This looks like one of those shitty velocity edits on tik tok with how much hes rubberbanding
[2023-01-10 21:19:11] <%S_mea_R> Who needs QA when you can just go straight to production. Big fo head move
[2023-01-10 21:19:11] <%DrMantisTBaggin> seqChat just fix the things
[2023-01-10 21:19:13] <%fouldser> @asteroidblues__ well i couldnt move at all today but another pmc could and he killed me freely
[2023-01-10 21:19:17] <%CoL3> @Shooktd hopefully in 2 years itll be fixed
[2023-01-10 21:19:31] <%JDiamatti> This is random as fuck but I dig the gloves your PMC is using.
[2023-01-10 21:19:33] <%+Floopyxo> they tested it drunk on vodka so they saw nothing wrong with servers LUL
[2023-01-10 21:19:41] <+The_BMoe> sup will
[2023-01-10 21:19:44] <%+dirtbikemx09> is this Ping and packetloss issues due to Tarkovs servers or our orwn internet?
[2023-01-10 21:19:55] <Bas4s> @WillerZ go night it will not log as much
[2023-01-10 21:19:56] <+tvggamezco> i think the gloves change as your level up right?

[2023-01-10 21:20:34] <%+dirtbikemx09> I have been having more lag and ping / latency issues this wipe then ever, to the point i get kicked from game and have to load in
[2023-01-10 21:20:46] <%Shooktd> they made plenty of money last year. im just curious what it will take for them to get the game fixed. is it not a money or engineer issue? is it a server limitation? i would imagine they have an idea by now.
[2023-01-10 21:20:50] <wambwamp> they were loading the server with player scavs. it should be better now
[2023-01-10 21:20:54] <%Playermodd> Hopefully a fix for streets is coming soon, im waiting to do those quests last
[2023-01-10 21:20:56] <caveBob64> let's see if a restart/cache clear will help BloodTrail

[2023-01-10 21:21:25] <ramg37> i have issues but not for more then 30seconds. then its just bad frames (30-60)

[2023-01-10 21:22:19] <!%MadDogHux> IMO night limits your view distance so it plays smoother
[2023-01-10 21:22:19] <%+highplainsdrifter> They should decrease the amount of player scavs. The shit fucks the entire server up every time a batch loads in
[2023-01-10 21:22:32] <%+dirtbikemx09> @ebelskivers I have been playing this for years and remember the BS back then for sure lol. Im just curious if anyone is struggling with Ping and packet loss issues this wipe on any map more than normal or last wipe? cuz mine is dumb most times lately

[2023-01-10 21:22:51] <%fluff_sama> they just can't handle 15 to 17 PMCs plus a bunch of player scavs on one map. they should tone down the player amount until they fix it imo

[2023-01-10 21:31:35] <%+rfarmer969> @WillerZ I feel like crab walking is bugged along with the sound it's one of those changes that makes less sense. Same like traders just doubling in price rnadomly for random intervals

[2023-01-10 21:42:16] <%Primacord> @Starweezyy 5800X3D is best gaming CPU right now, aside from 13900k. new 7xxxX3D will beat it but if you are on AM4, 5800X3D is beast
[2023-01-10 21:42:24] <%S_mea_R> You can build the exact same PCs, 5 of them, same everything. Each will likely run Tarkov completely different. bet

[2023-01-10 21:42:59] <%+campnf> only player scavs
[2023-01-10 21:43:01] <%axdragon1105> I say both
[2023-01-10 21:43:01] <+WhySync> scavs
[2023-01-10 21:43:01] <!%+seaotter42069> depends what part of the map but player scavs
[2023-01-10 21:43:03] <Official_SylaR> Should I wait till mild muscle pain is gone before lifting again?
[2023-01-10 21:43:04] <%+highplainsdrifter> Maybe 1 PMC every other raid, mainly player scavs
[2023-01-10 21:43:05] <%0MaG> pmcs because I don't stay in long
[2023-01-10 21:43:08] <%Deeman52055> i had one good raid with both of them coming at me
[2023-01-10 21:43:08] <%+imanato> player scavs own this map tbh
[2023-01-10 21:43:12] <%+asteroidblues__> streets feels like TDM tbh
[2023-01-10 21:43:13] <%+M3ridius> yes they need to turn down player scavs
[2023-01-10 21:43:13] <@%2L33Zy> More players but WAY more player scavs tbh
[2023-01-10 21:43:14] <%yournansbowl> alot of scavs if you hang central late game
[2023-01-10 21:43:14] <smeatures> i dont live long enough for the scavs to show up
[2023-01-10 21:43:19] <+londart21> Ok, I find it helpful as a viewer of good players, to be able to see what they are using, and how they use their hot key setup. But I get it.
[2023-01-10 21:43:20] <+Starweezyy> @asteroidblues__ true but not sure if I wanna buy an AM5 mobo yet
[2023-01-10 21:43:28] <%+rfarmer969> @WillerZ neither. My day raids are about the same since I usually hit my quests and dip.
[2023-01-10 21:43:39] <%+highplainsdrifter> funny that you assume I live long enough to fight the PMCs

[2023-01-10 22:23:37] <%Primacord> Ammo changes make it feel like it favors the pros even more so at the start of wipe. They will rush t4 trades & slower people will have an even bigger gap to overcome. Mid/end wipe it probably won't matter too much though
[2023-01-10 22:23:37] <+attackerr2> is 9x21 bt actually that good? never got to use it lol

[2023-01-10 22:24:13] <%EtherealDabi> I just see it as balancing MOST players. The 1% 2% of the no-lifers and streamers are still gonna roll people, but at least it'll be a smaller amount than normal.

[2023-01-10 22:26:11] <+TheDrov> To the far right
[2023-01-10 22:26:12] <KorgiAnalogue> @asteroidblues__ Leveling is only easy to people who know exactly what they're doing, later levels get very slow if you don't know how to task efficiently. Most ppl I play with never broke past like 30-32 last wipe

[2023-01-10 22:27:41] <KorgiAnalogue> @asteroidblues__ Idk but I know several people who quit because the progression became way too slow and the options became too low. Game's not fun if you're not getting to engage at all with the gun porn and gear aspect of it at all

[2023-01-10 22:28:11] <KorgiAnalogue> @stolemycannoli The issue with that is that the ammo spawns are super biased and some ammo like 5.45 is everywhere but some rounds are insanely rare despite not even being that good ^^'

[2023-01-10 22:36:21] <%vilelogan> @KorgiAnalogue If this was truly the case, no one would run anything other than a mosin or vpo. Even just a few decent mods are enough to make a "bad" gun good, and the best should be more rare.

[2023-01-10 22:38:12] <%vilelogan> @KorgiAnalogue That was my point. If they were only as good as the ammo you used, you'd only use what does the most pen and damage but its not as simple as that.
[2023-01-10 22:38:12] <KorgiAnalogue> BP being level 4 is 100% a good change its endgame ammo but damn they shouldve done it at the start, not after some ppl already hoarded a stock of it KEKW

[2023-01-10 22:38:52] <@%2L33Zy> Idk about you but SMGS have been RIPPING people apart
[2023-01-10 22:38:55] <%tom_kvass> that and with how accurate mutants and rds are ps will still laser people
[2023-01-10 22:38:59] <%+n1ghthavvk31> one of my dailies gives me a tank battery, so glad i dont need to struggle to carry one out now lol
[2023-01-10 22:39:00] <KorgiAnalogue> @vilelogan Yes and the point is nobodys gonna touch 7.62 ever again until level 4 traders. Youll never see people use stock/budget M1A/FAL/SR25 or anything because the ONLY people who CAN get usable ammo will also have level 4 mods

[2023-01-10 22:39:36] <KorgiAnalogue> @asteroidblues__ Wow ok thats a joke then lmao I have like two thousand rounds just because I leveled up early. This is exactly the type of progression related meta stuff that should be handled wipe by wipe and not 2 weeks after

[2023-01-10 22:40:06] <%vilelogan> @KorgiAnalogue It's not hard to find good ammo outside of traders though. Kill players. Kill raiders. Loot boxes. It still exists, you just cant buy it.

[2023-01-10 22:41:49] <%$ApacheSwiftness> @KorgiAnalogue I agree with the whole not doing it untill wipe not this 2 weeks after stuff. Its tarkov and we dont need meta everthing  it should be like a warzone. Hard as shit to find good shit unless you dedicate time and effort  not just farming a reset

[2023-01-10 22:42:33] <%vilelogan> @KorgiAnalogue I'm not talking about you. I'm talking about me! This wipe changed my playstyle to the extreme! I'm living proof all ANYONE has to do is play the game to get good stuff.
[2023-01-10 22:42:35] <KorgiAnalogue> @ApacheSwiftness Yeah, facts. Altho I do wish they would remove global trader limits since we have personals on so many things. Would like to play raids not camp vendors :x

[2023-01-10 22:43:23] <%$schwans__> @apacheswiftness come into streamers chats and just complain and complain and complain LUL
[2023-01-10 22:43:34] <wambwamp> there will be like dead zones on the map that have like 20 scavs on it. basement of concordia is one of them. cant be good for the game
[2023-01-10 22:43:43] <%vilelogan> @KorgiAnalogue Then people should try to find the things they want in raids rather than waiting 20 minutes on a vendor to buy it
[2023-01-10 22:43:45] <Trustno1diealone> U think there’s too much data for a PC to decifer

[2023-01-10 22:45:44] <%vilelogan> @ApacheSwiftness I actually agree with him on that one, Perma would devastate the game overall. Most players wouldn't touch it, as only hardcore players and cheaters could really thrive.
[2023-01-10 22:45:54] <magdude> is marked key worth keeping and using or should i sell?

[2023-01-10 23:37:31] <%AdderallBeforeBed> you can climb one of these staircases really high, the one that takes a key to get into a room
[2023-01-10 23:37:33] <%JDiamatti> God damn I wish I could afford to stream full time. I fucking love tarkov and twitch LUL

[2023-01-10 23:38:05] <DustyisHigh20> thats because none of our pc's can run this map
[2023-01-10 23:38:05] <Chinocchi> everybody scavs cuz its about same reward for less risk NODDERS
[2023-01-10 23:38:12] <$dryfartgang> Are players not running streets because of the rubber band?
[2023-01-10 23:38:13] <sHUC_> i cant even run this map LULW
[2023-01-10 23:38:13] <@%+AcidicRainDropZ> send the play scavs as scouts and have them sound off shots when they find one
[2023-01-10 23:38:33] <!%iDerpPD> we need a peeporubberband emote for streets Kappa
