[2023-01-08 13:47:31] <+icedoutroleyyy> @djheffs04 some people are just weird
[2023-01-08 13:47:36] <tweattyy> @suggestful So it‚Äôs a hit or miss. Maldini isn‚Äôt an auto defender. Maldini is for players who really know how to defend really well. He‚Äôs also the only cb in fifa that has his own tackling animations. Imo maldini mid-prime is arguably the best cbs in the game. I had both but did baby for free to save coins for toty. Slap a sentinel on him. That should fix his physicals and help you more in game
