[2022-12-28 14:59:16] <+axo_zx> what about midtown
[2022-12-28 14:59:38] <%+theeabsolutemaniac> @axo_zx you take space by using a corner to get back armor and shield so you can push in past said corner then take the next corner when low armor and shield
[2022-12-28 15:00:12] <+axo_zx> ah and shield is used to close/retreat that space and recharge armor/shield
[2022-12-28 15:00:14] <%+Aceattack> corner is L shaped so you make them walk the long line in L and hide behind the small line in L
[2022-12-28 15:00:17] <+axo_zx> ah I see I see actually
[2022-12-28 15:00:20] <@%aidreu> what if i want to be a dumbass peepoHappy

[2022-12-28 15:01:13] <%+theeabsolutemaniac> @axo_zx For example on paraiso when cloudy just played, on attack when you push to under the bridge you don't need to have shield up you can get shot a bit in poke phase to save shield and farm ult for your support
[2022-12-28 15:01:15] <%+Skar_> Im top 150 dumbass

[2022-12-28 16:46:32] <@^Nightbot> My favorite streamer is LHChair. he is very dark, has great lumbar support, and honestly he carries the stream when Cloudy is gone. He comes equipped with a very powerful height adjusting lever that’s perfect for our favorite streamer. LHChair doesn’t interact much so it’s really helps when chat can make their own content

[2022-12-28 19:51:20] <flannelmonke> my b
[2022-12-28 19:51:24] <hgr126> everytime i think about orisa, i just get tilted because i cannot imagine what the devs are thinking
[2022-12-28 19:51:52] <%iPRIxMAi> They are trying to figure out how to make 1 tank work
[2022-12-28 19:51:54] <%iPRIxMAi> honestly
[2022-12-28 19:51:59] <$marodas2> about being op in past. Is Zarya even played anymore in your games nowdays @LhCloudy27
[2022-12-28 19:52:04] <warab8> When r u going to start playing meta heroes
[2022-12-28 19:52:20] <CHICKEN2XD> Orisa is the moira of tanks. Nobody wants to play her because they like the character, all they want to do is abuse tank role for not dying and playing left click sim
[2022-12-28 19:52:34] VIEWERS: 521
[2022-12-28 19:52:35] <GenuineSB> zarya is used to counter dva :)
[2022-12-28 19:52:49] <%+Aceattack> there are some jq otp in top500
[2022-12-28 19:53:06] <CHICKEN2XD> Zarya still counters dva no? What happened that changed
[2022-12-28 19:53:20] <luazri> you can outplay the enemy Orisa as much as you can, but she's gonna stay alive and kill your backline
[2022-12-28 19:53:22] <+TrippyTriangle> jq is decent into ram
[2022-12-28 19:53:31] <+chesly_vakarian> people dont know the JQ match up so you can squeak out some wins but everyone knows how to crush nerfed zarya because she is a legacy tank
[2022-12-28 19:53:33] <%iPRIxMAi> Dive tanks are good against orisa
[2022-12-28 19:53:50] <@%aidreu> Oh yeah this is super fun with zen mercy
[2022-12-28 19:54:30] <CHICKEN2XD> Me when i see Zen mercy as my support “i love getting healed! I will get healed so much this game!” Kappa

[2022-12-28 19:54:54] <%iPRIxMAi> You don't need heals if the enemy team is dead
[2022-12-28 19:55:07] <luazri> zen mercy is ok if your dps and your zen can get a lot of dmg and end fights fast
[2022-12-28 19:55:13] <CHICKEN2XD> @iprixmai now this is a cloudy take
[2022-12-28 19:55:19] <@%aidreu> Nooo it’s fine but against pharah mercy ur echo has to destroy everything or gg
[2022-12-28 19:55:21] <%iPRIxMAi> It's just true
[2022-12-28 19:55:26] <CHICKEN2XD> Just kill them omegalul

[2022-12-28 19:55:44] <@%aidreu> @avon_blocksdale what do you mean?
[2022-12-28 19:55:45] <%plinkotheklinko> Finally finished up work for the day time for some OW. Thanks for getting me through 💜
[2022-12-28 19:55:50] <%+herpesfreesince3> @hgr126 Theyre like "we've gotta remove CC to make it more fun to play tank" but then simultaneously went "lets make Orisa a character who just makes the enemy tank constantly stunlocked and pushed around and literally unable to play the game for the whole match"
[2022-12-28 19:56:10] <avon_blocksdale> @aidreu was just a play on your name, aidreu sounds like "I drew" LUL
[2022-12-28 19:56:18] <CHICKEN2XD> @aidreu that sentence sounds like “press the middle button and get a sentence” type thing

[2022-12-28 19:57:07] <%iPRIxMAi> @CHICKEN2XD probably not in low elo but in high elo, people play smarter so you don't need as many heals for certain comps
[2022-12-28 19:57:13] <$marodas2> I found 2 zarya players in top 500 EU LULW

[2022-12-28 19:57:19] <CHICKEN2XD> @avon_blocksdale no problem LUL
[2022-12-28 19:57:32] <CHICKEN2XD> it’s funny after you explain it @avon_blocksdale
[2022-12-28 19:57:36] <luazri> @herpesfreesince3 it's not just that, Orisa has so much sustain that even if you outplay her and killed a dps or a support she's gonna stay alive more than you can
[2022-12-28 19:57:48] <avon_blocksdale> @aidreu haha I see lmao, had a feeling I wasn';t the first LUL
[2022-12-28 19:57:51] <warab8> Even though i like lbdd7 but i hate watching pharah players win

[2022-12-28 19:58:38] <avon_blocksdale> wn;t lie, sometimes I'm not sure what my role is on tank in OW2
[2022-12-28 19:58:50] <avon_blocksdale> do I match the other tank, or do I just bee line to supports
[2022-12-28 19:59:00] <CHICKEN2XD> @iprixmai that support would work with either pharah/echo for #1 dps and tracer/genji for 2nd dps. Zen keeps discord on squishy and mercy heals the airborne dps. Hog for tank- sounds good no?

[2022-12-28 20:06:13] <@^Nightbot> My favorite streamer is LHChair. he is very dark, has great lumbar support, and honestly he carries the stream when Cloudy is gone. He comes equipped with a very powerful height adjusting lever that’s perfect for our favorite streamer. LHChair doesn’t interact much so it’s really helps when chat can make their own content
