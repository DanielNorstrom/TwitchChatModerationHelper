[2022-12-08 14:21:05] <%StarAnjeLyn> How is that possible. Don't they have to inspect it for insurance reasons every year?
[2022-12-08 14:21:31] <@%Pydrex> Only came up when I got it inspected for remortgage and then had to pay like £1k to even have a structual report done.

[2022-12-08 16:11:08] <%RoyalWolfXD> @Silverheart59 This is why streamers run controlled ads, it disables pre-roll which is most likely to affect a viewer. If they know when ads play, they can go for bathroom or try to limit the "exclusive" content

[2022-12-08 17:28:29] <+ros_ego> @fenxor yep this is basically what state/county level police are for, the municipalities that are too small to have their own police force
