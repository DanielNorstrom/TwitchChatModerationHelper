[2022-12-21 00:02:06] <%$SweetSietske> I took a shuttlebus out of LAX and was out of there real fast, but by car it's probably way harder

[2022-12-21 00:02:18] <%Missygirl93> Just change and accessory
[2022-12-21 00:02:19] <%+jo_lyn_rct> My husband and I are sick and our roof leaked last night. Our Xmas travel probably won’t happen.
[2022-12-21 00:02:19] <%+simmerskye7> Sacramento isn’t too bad, just confusing if you don’t know which terminal you’re going to
[2022-12-21 00:02:28] <%DeepestNightmare> driving is scary
[2022-12-21 00:02:28] <%+alicia_raee> I feel very lucky to live near a fairly small, easy airport
[2022-12-21 00:02:32] <leifeste> the driving anxiety was really really bad for me for a while, but it got better once I started therapy again!

[2022-12-21 00:03:11] <rubieluna> My driving anxiety was so bad and then my therapist started forcing me to do in person sessions and it’s much better now that im back in texas instead of hawaii😅

[2022-12-21 00:06:19] <emopancake> honolulu international airport can be miserable at times because you have to walk outside to most of the gates and its always humid and hot
[2022-12-21 00:06:25] <@%brewwin> yup they want it to be like a dome. you probably dont remember ours that well but its smaller.

[2022-12-21 00:10:24] <@%brewwin> i randomly caught fugu i was so mad i didnt even try i just needed something else

[2022-12-21 00:11:09] <%$SweetSietske> do you get like long rainy days in florida or mostly just short showers? cause isn't the climate based on your actual location?
[2022-12-21 00:11:17] <%munchella> the one and only time I caught it was a thunderstorm
[2022-12-21 00:11:21] <%modernwednesday> I understand the oven is there for gameplay, but out of context it looks very bizarre

[2022-12-21 16:08:41] <%Jeais> I love beagles but I'm so happy I went for a breed that doesn't bark much. I get too many migraines for that
[2022-12-21 16:08:44] <@%goosekingdom> my grandpas first two were pretty chaotic and independent but his rescue one was the opposite, but some severe separation stuff simsieCry

[2022-12-21 16:16:05] <monbebestarlight> This is fun because I'm working from home today and we are also playing bingo at work. I've got a bingo card and our HR department is sending out random numbers throughout the day 😂
[2022-12-21 16:16:07] <cakepersona> a big paramedic strike in uk happening today its scary
[2022-12-21 16:16:16] <simsxing> My switch does that in the basement

[2022-12-21 16:16:17] <jammie_dounut> who does she have seen
[2022-12-21 16:16:21] <zoton2> The Switch WiFi is notoriously bad. Might as well just use ethernet if it's only for streaming while docked.
[2022-12-21 16:16:21] <simsxing> So annoying
[2022-12-21 16:16:21] <writerinfandomworld> my switch is picky too! my room's upstairs and its not too too far from the wifi box but for whatever reason it just does not wanna hold a good connection 🤣

[2022-12-21 16:22:26] <%$Theresevers> @AnnetteMaily villager hunting is hunting for a villager in animal crossin, you do this by visiting the islands where one random villager will appear. you can then choose to invite them to live on your island and be your friend. you can only do this if you have an empty plot i.e. a place where a new one can move in because another one moved out

[2022-12-21 16:25:03] <+caroline_olivia> I’m making a cherry apple crumble for my husband 🥰
[2022-12-21 16:25:03] <%$gwensimmer> I can’t believe Simsie is voluntarily making cooked fruit
[2022-12-21 16:25:06] <%+madisonemily8> i like both, but i feel like cherry pie is more summery
[2022-12-21 16:25:06] <%+sophielovescoffeeanddogs> but you'd have to pit the cherries dont you
[2022-12-21 16:25:07] <%+1mp3rfectb0y> DOnt forget to buy a lot of tea bestie, the british will wnat it
[2022-12-21 16:25:07] <%+rubymadigan> luckily here you just buy mincemeat in a jar
[2022-12-21 16:25:08] <%$quinoasalad26> but you also have topit the cherries
[2022-12-21 16:25:09] <+TenaciousSweets> what about a cherry and apple pie!
[2022-12-21 16:25:10] <@%Equipy> I was in London for a full month during holiday season and didn’t try mince pies once
[2022-12-21 16:25:10] <SandbagX> I wonder what's more awkward... giving an apple to Cherry, or giving a cherry to Apple....
[2022-12-21 16:25:10] <+norekretzz> Gotta core cherries though too and that’s worse
[2022-12-21 16:25:10] <%+mcat11> Yes, dutch apple pie with the sugary crumbly topping

[2022-12-21 16:25:13] <@%hellcathhh> also youd hav to pit the cherries anyway
[2022-12-21 16:25:13] <@%+MrsTomato101814> you can also crowdsource peeling apples if you need to
[2022-12-21 16:25:14] <%alicexaw> bestie get that apple pie with custard on the go thats the best

[2022-12-21 16:25:15] <@%goosekingdom> you can use frozen cherries
[2022-12-21 16:25:16] <$stormsgalore> you should make american pie

[2022-12-21 16:25:22] <@%goosekingdom> that are already pitted
[2022-12-21 16:25:22] <%+TheClumsyGamer4> do they sell mince meat (for mince pies) in jars in the USA like they do here in the UK? a lot faster and easier
[2022-12-21 16:25:25] <%+ThatgirlChristine> What about Apple crisp? its soo good. with the nice crumble on top. yumm
[2022-12-21 16:25:25] <@%goosekingdom> i think so
[2022-12-21 16:25:27] <NicholleStephani> Apple seems more christmassy, with the warm spices
[2022-12-21 16:25:27] <%+Pizza_Party_Princess> Yes!
[2022-12-21 16:25:28] <%+lovatolane> Will his family be on stream?

[2022-12-21 16:25:37] <%+kaleygb> i’ve made blueberry pie and it’s very good but apple is the best

[2022-12-21 16:25:38] <TheQueerArtPagan> Halved cherries are usually pitted before freezing.
[2022-12-21 16:25:38] <%$alaurel17> they should be but i have gotten an acciental pit in them before
[2022-12-21 16:25:39] <%breayonasaurus> you actually dont have to peel the apples for apple pie. I don't peel the apples for my pie
[2022-12-21 16:25:39] <%+gamesr4mums> They would. But they would get super mushy

[2022-12-21 16:31:39] <TheQueerArtPagan> Eh, it's a horse apiece. We went through a tornado a few years ago, trashed everything. Wind damage from that tornado on trees caused a lot of them to fall during our last snowstorm and took out power for days. :( Wind sucks, too.

[2022-12-21 16:48:49] <HolyTrashpandas> I had a dream about DDV, I don’t even have it…
[2022-12-21 16:48:54] <%$alaurel17> i worry about what might change when it has paid stuff in game
[2022-12-21 16:48:57] <hithenamesreese> you can already pay for the moonstones
[2022-12-21 16:49:00] <poetpretzel> hopefully the starpath is like the battle pass in fall guys, where buying ONE pays for them all (if you spend wisely)
[2022-12-21 16:49:03] <stefan_bodie> do you have cammo frog
[2022-12-21 16:49:03] <%Jnxsey> I brought the deluxe i think because I saw you playing it and I loved it.  Also, if i hated it i could pass it to my kids who really wanted it, lol.
[2022-12-21 16:49:04] <+Rosa_Luna> i bought the expensive version for pc and switch....
[2022-12-21 16:49:08] <%+sarahbenton4> I bought the basic ddv pack and I’ve ended up getting some of the stuff that came with the most expensive pack from chests and stuff
[2022-12-21 16:49:11] <zook22238> hiiii
[2022-12-21 16:49:24] <$zakrunchy> do you think if you buy it in early access you'll have to pay for the "battle pass" thing once it goes free?
[2022-12-21 16:49:24] <%Dawnie3296> Good morning!
[2022-12-21 16:49:27] <%Jeais> Why is he so cute

[2022-12-21 16:49:35] <+lex_in_tenebris> he does look vaguely Florida though
[2022-12-21 16:49:41] <writerinfandomworld> i love rod! he was one of my starting villagers
[2022-12-21 16:49:42] <%chaosollie> If you like the gameplay - buy stardew. I know its vastly different but I know I wouldn't like DDV because I can't get to know new characters and they are romance-able XD
[2022-12-21 16:49:46] <+Silent_Five> Did anyone else get the deluxe edition but didn’t get the extra stuff?
[2022-12-21 16:49:47] <$chaicricket> I haven't even played DDLV obsessively or anything, and I've already got 106hrs. Totally worth it to me.

[2022-12-21 16:54:17] <@%goosekingdom> it took me like 4 hours to complete the story so would be a good 1 stream endeavor
[2022-12-21 16:54:22] <+tay_handstand> i saw someone play lil gater it is so cute
[2022-12-21 16:54:28] <%dora_the_destroyaa_> i dont feel its needed
[2022-12-21 16:54:29] <%+swagcamryn> hi!!! just got here ;) good morning
[2022-12-21 16:54:32] <%MustangCJ> i don't have one villager yet in bingo :(
[2022-12-21 16:54:33] <lou22eva> you should try Hokko life - it's like my sims meets the animal crossing (sort of)
[2022-12-21 16:54:39] <%$margteer> I bought the cheapest one and I’ve loved it so I don’t think you need it!!
[2022-12-21 16:54:39] <%$jacksonpent> i bought the base and i havent needed any of the things
[2022-12-21 16:54:41] <@%+MrsTomato101814> yeah, the nice perk is the extra moonstones
[2022-12-21 16:54:50] <$GalacticAtlas> I get fomo so I bought the deluxe version, but I also agree. You don't really need it
[2022-12-21 16:54:52] <hithenamesreese> i bought the middle version bc it had the best furniture in my mind
[2022-12-21 16:54:54] <%Jeais> I want the piano for top tier but otherwise I wish I got base pack instead of middle tier
[2022-12-21 16:54:54] <%+brimmstorm> i agree!!
[2022-12-21 16:55:03] <ostothewin> have you try the A Little To The Left? It's a wee bit like Unpacking, but you're not arranging the whole room

[2022-12-21 16:55:14] <%haleysticks> There’s so many things you can buy in Scrooge’s game shop it’s fine without
[2022-12-21 16:55:17] <oceana_blue> Hey Kayla! Just tuned in!
[2022-12-21 16:55:22] <%+brimmstorm> i bought the highest tier, and i think i could still do the same things without it
[2022-12-21 16:55:23] <smolfrogpotato> who was that?

[2022-12-21 16:56:33] <%alicexaw> tbh i wouldnt reccomend streaming it bc it was so hard for me and i got stressed on my own lmao
[2022-12-21 16:56:33] <rivrix> people deffo backseat that game
[2022-12-21 16:56:34] <%Jeais> Back seating can be so bad for puzzles simsieCry
[2022-12-21 16:56:38] <shannonandy> Good morning!
[2022-12-21 16:56:39] <%+Alyx1210> would you and Dan ever consider playing It Takes Two?
[2022-12-21 16:56:40] <ostothewin> I played it on stream and eventho they were friendly I still feel the pressure lol
[2022-12-21 16:56:40] <%$SailorScout04> Ooh I hate Cyrano
[2022-12-21 16:56:40] <coolbabycat> Make us emote only
[2022-12-21 16:56:42] <%kaytast> candy crush stream when??
[2022-12-21 16:56:43] <%socallie> maybe not on stream, but i think you'd enjoy cats organized neatly
[2022-12-21 16:56:50] <%$basically_npr_trash> a little to the left is great, but I don't like watching other people play it because of the backseating that happens
[2022-12-21 16:56:51] <%+snowy_flake> the backseating will probably be bad
[2022-12-21 16:56:52] <@%+MrsTomato101814> if you ever miss a villager, we have a list in the discord
[2022-12-21 16:56:58] <%Jeais> Anyone else unable to focus on work because it's almost Christmas? simsieOMG
[2022-12-21 16:56:59] <%letsclarindo> i really recommend Florence, its like unpacking
[2022-12-21 16:57:02] <%marlibuuuu> everyone will be telling you "go a little to the left" and will be overhwleming

[2022-12-21 17:11:39] <Lynn3gigliotti> I think in some cultures twins were seen as a bad omen.
[2022-12-21 17:11:39] <%RiverTheGreasyRat> My best friend is a twin but her and her sister are so different

[2022-12-21 17:11:42] <aleesya06> My mom is the youngest of 5 and my mom wanted 5 kids before I was born. I can’t imagine having 3 younger siblings

[2022-12-21 17:11:44] <@%+MrsTomato101814> now multiples are more common because women are having kids later in life
[2022-12-21 17:11:45] <%modernwednesday> My nana had twin older brother and sister

[2022-12-21 17:11:54] <TheChirpyCricket> I think you'd be able to tell a lot of times that there's more than one, especially if its not  a first time parent
[2022-12-21 17:11:55] <%+AllyLobster> My dad had an aunt and uncle who were twins, I think about the same age as your grandpa

Please don't make a big deal about it or guilt her in chat. It's really upsetting to have people complaining all day when we're just trying to have fun. She has TONS of Sims content on YouTube, and we'll play The Sims again later this week.
