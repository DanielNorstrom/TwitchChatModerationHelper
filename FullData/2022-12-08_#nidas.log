[2022-12-08 16:25:33] <%JoeA62484> I think being edgy rule brakey usually gets more pogs by certain viewerbase so then they might get more viewers as a result
[2022-12-08 16:25:35] <%leafsprek> YEP the challenge of being staff in any game server is discerning mistake rule breaks to intentional rule breaks

[2022-12-08 16:26:40] <%Pututu> i feel like u and penta have the same view on how RP should be in your eyes, but i could be wrong
[2022-12-08 16:27:03] <BillyBazamWalters> Have you seen the video of Omie talking with Koil about public bans?
[2022-12-08 16:27:04] <%yanusboy69> I was watching some vids of early 3.0 and it is so much better and different to what the state of rp is now
[2022-12-08 16:27:07] <+Ziimms> Do you think more strict whitelist rules might change that?

[2022-12-08 16:27:34] <%IKEA_DOG> I feel like WL should kinda be "light-rp" and hardcore be focused more on rp

[2022-12-08 16:28:22] <%leafsprek> I don't see it as a lesser server but often the RP that is on it is 'light' RP where people are in the world but it's mainly just like a big chat room
[2022-12-08 16:28:25] <vbw12> Imo public’s like a ssb world
[2022-12-08 16:29:01] <!%brutalmoineau> agreed

[2022-12-08 16:45:56] <!%+xthebutchx> Sometimes it burns a hole in your pocket. Having a job or retirement is key so it’s taken before it’s in your pocket.
[2022-12-08 16:46:01] <%leafsprek> It's a lot easier to save money if you cook your own meals and do meal prep tbh, takeaway is expensive KEKW

[2022-12-08 16:46:34] <%bluddee> If I didn’t eat take out food I would probably save a few hundred bucks a month but I like take out
[2022-12-08 16:46:43] <NataIIion> you can just set up an automatic transfer every month and just forget about it
[2022-12-08 16:46:46] <+Ziimms> Not a problem, but when your washing machine breaks its nice that you can buy a new one
[2022-12-08 16:46:52] <%+slomaxgaming> Always makes me think of the fisherman on the beach story
[2022-12-08 16:46:52] <%DAN_I_E_L_> It's not really a massive problem to not save. Debt is the problem.
[2022-12-08 16:46:54] <%+amorton15> have to find balance
[2022-12-08 16:46:55] <%IKEA_DOG> @xilefelo I'm the exact same
[2022-12-08 16:47:01] <%+driimus> Deadge people relying on pension
[2022-12-08 16:47:08] <%leafsprek> At the end of the day, money exists to fund your enjoyment in life. Use it as you please but keep enough to be safe is my take on it @Nidas
[2022-12-08 16:47:08] <%ksking11> Just had a friend die with a huge retirement account before she got to spend it. Gotta enjoy it along the way
[2022-12-08 16:47:12] <!%brutalmoineau> I would save if I could I think, at least a little bit, would be nice to have a safety net
[2022-12-08 16:47:19] <ItsMapleTV> imagine actually having debt KEKW
[2022-12-08 16:47:21] <%Pututu> here in the netherlands neither
[2022-12-08 16:47:28] <@%gostonko> I had to take $20k out of my retirement fund during covid lockdowns maaaaan
[2022-12-08 16:47:32] <santilloo88> im swede, i was the first to anwser
[2022-12-08 16:47:36] <%+Kyffen> yeah dont feel like we learn much about it either atleast when i went to school
[2022-12-08 16:47:38] <@%gostonko> elderly gostonko is gonna be pissed about that
[2022-12-08 16:47:39] <%Xzorgdar> In France neither
[2022-12-08 16:47:46] <santilloo88> i know
[2022-12-08 16:47:46] <Vertxel> yeah having a do not touch savings account of like 2-5k is good, otherwise savings interest isn't going to do much for ya, rather invest.
[2022-12-08 16:47:49] <%leafsprek> yeah we have a site in the UK where you can find your co-workers pay anonymously or some shit
[2022-12-08 16:47:57] <santilloo88> 100%
[2022-12-08 16:47:58] <%okayduud> gostonko thinking he is going to retire in this economy maaaaan

[2022-12-08 16:48:35] <ItsMapleTV> @gostonko covid 19 actually allowed me to make more money then ever and now I am a land lord who sits on his ass at 27 with 2 kids and a wife who's currently going to school for nursing to work in retirement homes
[2022-12-08 16:48:41] <%DAN_I_E_L_> And watch inflation devalue the money Gladge
[2022-12-08 16:48:42] <santilloo88> i live on the hope of zombie apocalyps, that helps
[2022-12-08 16:48:44] <%Heniij> onyl somethingh liek 10 buffer would make me feel comfortable
[2022-12-08 16:48:46] <%+slomaxgaming> You want a 6 month expenses emergency fund, so no matter what happens you got time to figure it out
[2022-12-08 16:48:51] <vbw12> 5k is like 1 ER visit in america lol
[2022-12-08 16:48:55] <%Pututu> 2-5k is a lot for me LUL
[2022-12-08 16:48:59] <GetFacebook> I've had these convos with my friends but we all just started earning money or are still in school
[2022-12-08 16:49:00] <xilefelo> you think that taboo of talking about money comes from "bosses" trying to minmax their workers or is intrinsic in humans?
[2022-12-08 16:49:00] <%leafsprek> @ItsMapleTV GIGACHAD Fellow landlord life

[2022-12-08 16:49:24] <masterswordsmen23> when i took my new position at work, they literally told me NOT to tell anyone how much I make , its weird. Also idgaf if I want to i will but ... its weird
[2022-12-08 16:49:26] <santilloo88> then u live in sweden, everthing costs. THE TAXES
[2022-12-08 16:49:28] <+Ziimms> Just one of the crack commands, keeping it real
[2022-12-08 16:49:28] <%skoshia> You can look up peoples taxable income or something in Sweden right? So even if people don't talk about it, you could kinda find out
[2022-12-08 16:49:30] <eighty5NORTH> But the same time I feel like you might get more bs answer in twitch chat bc u got people trying to “pretend” they are successful so they say more off the wall comments in a chat to fit in
[2022-12-08 16:49:31] <@%gostonko> eat the landlords tbqh

[2022-12-08 17:48:59] <%argonzzzzz> I feel like its a good idea but dont people want to put themselves on the map? Like unless you have a following it would be hard to get recognition
[2022-12-08 17:49:22] <%JoeA62484> Like LGX with the banana bandit stuff
[2022-12-08 17:49:23] <%+Nemeux> those kind of ppl feel like Dungeon Masters of RP

[2022-12-08 17:49:49] <+Monkey_Knife_Fights> the whole point is that it's not for recognition, it's for the betterment of the rp on the server
[2022-12-08 17:50:15] <%+jgd2w22> @Nemeux that's a great analogy. "questgivers" are pretty rare on the server overall
[2022-12-08 17:50:37] <%argonzzzzz> @Monkey_Knife_Fights yeah but how realistic is that approach unless your wiseguy or someone with power and influence

[2022-12-08 19:01:51] <yewert> csgo recoil is different
[2022-12-08 19:01:55] <%leafsprek> To be honest this is better than the bloom before
[2022-12-08 19:02:01] <%bluddee> Are people complaining cause it’s too easy to counter?
[2022-12-08 19:02:05] <+eseShami> Z
[2022-12-08 19:02:07] <SteveNeato> Recoil seems like a good idea as long as there's recoil on all guns.
