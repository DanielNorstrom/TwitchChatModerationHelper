[2022-12-28 12:14:25] <%N1GHTwalkerr> Balls hang out between the ring and cage no?
[2022-12-28 12:14:29] <%+sam_the_stampede> I susppose the testicles can be passed through the loop one at a time, but it does NOT look comfortable
[2022-12-28 12:14:31] <%+AzzaNine> it hurts or pops off
[2022-12-28 12:14:35] <Cielwave> I think balls hang out between the ring and cage yeah
[2022-12-28 12:14:36] <@%ThatVtuberAlex> yes so the ring goes behind the balls
[2022-12-28 12:14:37] <%Dragonator_g> To be fair that would work if the man is fit and doesn't have a contraction reaction.

[2022-12-28 16:31:36] <%+Zero_gs> sunbreak fixes a lot of the issues with rise but if you want a much slower monster hunter experience try Generations ultimate on switch however it is jankey as hell, iceborne is a good mix of of GU and sunbreak
[2022-12-28 16:31:48] <@%MuruVT> yeah wasnt monster hunter the first game i "Bought" for you cuz it was before i had you on steam so i donated the money
