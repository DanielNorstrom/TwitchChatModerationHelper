[2022-12-07 18:01:03] <%denvermullets> depends on the subject but mostly bs
[2022-12-07 18:01:03] <%xdeepsx> I always did it in homeroom so it's was worthless
[2022-12-07 18:01:03] <%potapeno> you need homework
[2022-12-07 18:01:03] <enzostik> i prefeer homework better then exams Sadge
[2022-12-07 18:01:04] <%bracketmanps> it's probably unnecessary?
[2022-12-07 18:01:04] <+MalachiteKell> yes, but not to the extreme that it seems to be now
[2022-12-07 18:01:04] <%midgarsommar> NOPERS.
[2022-12-07 18:01:04] <%$jawsgst> it is getting you ready for a life of never being able to separate yourself from work and to expect work outside of work
[2022-12-07 18:01:05] <fdyin> Like everything, in moderation
[2022-12-07 18:01:05] <%Etterbeer> depends on what and whos doing it
[2022-12-07 18:01:05] <%$richi_lopez_> I believe it exists
[2022-12-07 18:01:05] <Polantaris> Homework on a subject you like is awesome, on a subject you hate is awful.
[2022-12-07 18:01:05] <%Seda_Give> Math homework is required for practice
[2022-12-07 18:01:05] <Selicre> only if it's moderate and not overwhelming
[2022-12-07 18:01:05] <%chillsalmon> hated it but probably good
[2022-12-07 18:01:05] <%Lika_sika> reading is a good home work
[2022-12-07 18:01:05] <+Splatts_mcgee> When I gave homework as a teacher I allowed sufficient time to complete in class
[2022-12-07 18:01:06] <%c_parts> in moderation
[2022-12-07 18:01:06] <%+carwash_> make school 8 hours long and leave the rest of our day to us
[2022-12-07 18:01:08] <%MeatballNicky> hated doing it, understand why its done
[2022-12-07 18:01:08] <%$joshy0302> depended on the subject really.
[2022-12-07 18:01:08] <%balrogRPG> Yes because its a free babysitter
[2022-12-07 18:01:08] <%+Healthier> never did homework in school.  I give myself homework at work
[2022-12-07 18:01:08] <zal0k> yes, but depending on the kid
[2022-12-07 18:01:08] <bobbyprin> e
[2022-12-07 18:01:08] <%$Br1ck4> very little and it can be useful
[2022-12-07 18:01:08] <%+knadams90> yes, can't really learn math without homework
[2022-12-07 18:01:08] <%+sailfinn> homework is fine as long as it's not overwhelming
[2022-12-07 18:01:08] <%slairf> i can see the benefit of it, but allow time in school for it to be done
[2022-12-07 18:01:08] <%eagleheardt> Over the summer work is BULLSHIT
[2022-12-07 18:01:08] <%y0ssarin> Must do or you cannot
[2022-12-07 18:01:08] <%+heatherm176> in moderation
[2022-12-07 18:01:08] <MTGisBetter> I forgot everything I wrote on homework
[2022-12-07 18:01:08] <%greg4231> independent practice is important to master material
[2022-12-07 18:01:09] <%+Shadow5589> I believe in a thing called love tbh
[2022-12-07 18:01:09] <%$Nymh79> indeed so, most indeededly.
[2022-12-07 18:01:09] <Hupsaurus> gives discipline
[2022-12-07 18:01:09] <$moribund> it can be implemented poorly
[2022-12-07 18:01:09] <%Rosisson> it's useful if used right
[2022-12-07 18:01:09] <Code8> good, but not when it's 2 hrs per day
[2022-12-07 18:01:09] <%+Bento_W> homework is good for reinforcing concepts, but if you already have a firm grasp on the subject it feels like a waste of time
[2022-12-07 18:01:10] <bobbyprin> g
[2022-12-07 18:01:10] <%Manon66> Homework is trash. School work is for school
[2022-12-07 18:01:10] <%+Vomitflowers> Some things more than others
[2022-12-07 18:01:10] <%othernathan> most hw was busy work, if it actually helps then its useful
[2022-12-07 18:01:10] <%$rom_eat> it's always busy work
[2022-12-07 18:01:12] <%sergimon90> gotta let kids ve kids and not bog them down with homework, man
[2022-12-07 18:01:12] <$toorima> i dont mind it as a dad, but there needs to be a limit
[2022-12-07 18:01:12] <%$sedael> dumb below high school but fine in high school and college
[2022-12-07 18:01:12] <%+x10power> My bus ride was so long from school I just did all my homework on the bus
[2022-12-07 18:01:12] <%Ekin0x> It sucks, but for most its probably useful
[2022-12-07 18:01:12] <bobbyprin> t
[2022-12-07 18:01:13] <%+Corrugate> Good for math and reading books.
[2022-12-07 18:01:14] <jimmieblack> no

[2022-12-07 18:01:14] <%+ragnucklives> Yes, but not copious amounts for one class/subject
[2022-12-07 18:01:14] <%+penguinfarm> yeah I'm conflicted because it kind of helps, but is stresses the fuck out of kids
[2022-12-07 18:01:15] <%Weebl72> Teaches time management skills
[2022-12-07 18:01:15] <%+Goreum> homework is verifiably a useless holdover from outdated teaching methods.
[2022-12-07 18:01:15] <aries04> depends on amount and quality
[2022-12-07 18:01:16] <86MrMeeseeks> it exists. i believe!
[2022-12-07 18:01:16] <Serchinnho> as a teacher I can tell you, you DO need homework
[2022-12-07 18:01:16] <+based_polski> Busy work shouldnt be homework
[2022-12-07 18:01:16] <bobbyprin> o
[2022-12-07 18:01:16] <Nastradooomus> Unless your class is showing signs of really just not understanding
[2022-12-07 18:01:16] <%ropeaderp> I'd hate it if work made do more work at home at the end of the day
[2022-12-07 18:01:16] <%theBonestorm> I feel like it should be limited
[2022-12-07 18:01:17] <%+Misssster_Anderson> I feel like it can be good to cement class learning but also unnecessary
[2022-12-07 18:01:17] <%wOmBo__ZoMbO> waste of time
[2022-12-07 18:01:17] <%OOOO_Sebby> a little reading or a little bit of studying of some sort
[2022-12-07 18:01:17] <%$Toadv1ne> I think it depends on what it's for. If it's just a rinse and repeat then no, but if you're prepping for a lesson then yes.
[2022-12-07 18:01:17] <%$sloth_fiend> studies show its not that helpful
[2022-12-07 18:01:18] <%rustyjonez_> I personally hated it and didn't need it. Esp with math
[2022-12-07 18:01:18] <TheDankLordSauron> I like the option to do it
[2022-12-07 18:01:18] <%Mango_Gnom> depends, in some cases/classes you have to do it in other they make like no sense at all
[2022-12-07 18:01:18] <Sizukun1> homework is stupid and I hate it because it serves no purpose other than additional practice. If you know the content you know it, if you don't you dont
[2022-12-07 18:01:18] <bobbyprin> m
[2022-12-07 18:01:19] <%box_chan_> when homework is, copy this text, is stupid, i had a lot of thatkind of homework when i was a kid
[2022-12-07 18:01:20] <%yoshigirla> I had homework growing up but I liked it when the teacher gave us the opportunity to get it done in class
[2022-12-07 18:01:21] <%geekella> Teacher here. Homework is a waste of time and energy.
[2022-12-07 18:01:21] <unclever_man> yes, unless your parents are shit and never help you with learning self-discipline, then no
[2022-12-07 18:01:21] <%+MoeFugga43> For certain subjects. Math 100% needs homework IMO
[2022-12-07 18:01:21] <%BurrowCreature> there is a difference between practice and homework
[2022-12-07 18:01:21] <E3hype> home work is useful but should not be overly substantial
[2022-12-07 18:01:21] <%+Spopovich678> its good when it serves a point / reinforces classwork
[2022-12-07 18:01:21] <+BigNeppy> I think it's important for math
[2022-12-07 18:01:21] <%+hobbes1408> it depends. busy work is bullshit. but home projects can be good
[2022-12-07 18:01:21] <%cloudhppr> I never did homework and tested well
[2022-12-07 18:01:21] <%$OffDutyBill> Yes, but I think there's a hard ceiling to how effective it is
[2022-12-07 18:01:22] <bobbyprin> y
[2022-12-07 18:01:22] <IgnoreMySub> like many teaching tools its benefit entirely depends on the student
[2022-12-07 18:01:22] <%Superlink> a lot of teachers are forced to give it, so it's meaningless. but some classes are good for it, like math where you have to practice
[2022-12-07 18:01:23] <%Vbraille> If there’s stuff not finished in class then sure. But no beyond that. Not homework for the sake of it
[2022-12-07 18:01:23] <%SWIZZPLS> me :)
[2022-12-07 18:01:23] <%+WeedBullet> As much as I hate homework I tend to see it as akin to practicing a musical instrument
[2022-12-07 18:01:23] <Vincinerator> homework was great for me in my math classes where repetition of formulas was the goal
[2022-12-07 18:01:23] <%Switchorz> bunch of school district shills
[2022-12-07 18:01:24] <bobbyprin> c
[2022-12-07 18:01:24] <%Spirilicious> it allows kids to go at their own pace and it's good to consolidate  what you've learned
[2022-12-07 18:01:25] <%PapaNug> i think homework is great for math and sciences, but makes no sense for english or history
[2022-12-07 18:01:25] <%tenlittlepiggies> I think it’s training for a nation of wage slaves to take their work home with them, unpaid
[2022-12-07 18:01:25] <%IdolizeDT> depends on the subject and style of homework, but repetition helps instill knowledge
[2022-12-07 18:01:25] <%+GaimeGuy> Makes more sense than 1 giant test worth 30-70% of your grade
[2022-12-07 18:01:25] <%+demZyxx> I hated it, did bare minimum
[2022-12-07 18:01:26] <bobbyprin> b
[2022-12-07 18:01:26] <%wolttam> omgthechat
[2022-12-07 18:01:27] <BonsaiMaverick> I usually did it in class before I got home.
[2022-12-07 18:01:28] <bobbyprin> a
[2022-12-07 18:01:28] <%evanworse> as a teacher i profoundly dislike most homework
[2022-12-07 18:01:29] <%$spyderr> Homework = Overtime for children basically. I hated homework.
[2022-12-07 18:01:29] <%JusticeNipples> Wait. Do kids not have homework anymore?
[2022-12-07 18:01:29] <%$MossBeard> Get a software engineering degree without homework LUL
[2022-12-07 18:01:30] <%$agn0sis> I feel like I do, but studies show it's not great. I'm conflicted about it
[2022-12-07 18:01:30] <%$jawsgst> i always hated homework
[2022-12-07 18:01:32] <%$mDoys> exactly, I needed the homework in some case, and sometime, it was just a waaste of time
[2022-12-07 18:01:32] <%Demagus3> homework is for work that wasn't finished at school. i taught physics which can be HARD so i would much rather students do the work in class where they can ask questions
[2022-12-07 18:01:32] <%HungSolo1625> yes to homework
[2022-12-07 18:01:32] <$SpiritWarriorx> I learned more outside then at school......
[2022-12-07 18:01:32] <%+RolloDaViking> Yes, need to learn to self motivate through a task
[2022-12-07 18:01:32] <%SamuraiPoet88> Clockwork Orange monkaS
[2022-12-07 18:01:33] <+UraniumQ33> Also, ONCE you graduate you can always look up how to do it.
[2022-12-07 18:01:33] <%InsolentFork> I hate that my kids teachers think I should teach them it all again at night
[2022-12-07 18:01:33] <%alucard835> strapped down? COCKA
[2022-12-07 18:01:33] <%BradRobertson09> long term projects = yes, but busy work and worksheets? that's dumb
[2022-12-07 18:01:33] <bobbyprin> i
[2022-12-07 18:01:33] <%$HuntFilmz> I had a college prof give me an fail on a creative paper because she thought my opinions were "wrong"
[2022-12-07 18:01:34] <%+WhiskeyWood> I feel they should give extra work for those who need it but not mandatory busy work.
[2022-12-07 18:01:35] <+captain_bustemup> I think it's a valuable learning tool in some courses.  but it isn't the only learning tool.  it should be available, but not required.
[2022-12-07 18:01:35] <bobbyprin> ?
[2022-12-07 18:01:35] <%+groooves_> I don't believe in homework. But I do think there should be long running projects that help reinforce learning
[2022-12-07 18:01:35] <%$redechidna9> you need both
[2022-12-07 18:01:35] <%frame_perfect_failure> Homework yes. Busywork no.
[2022-12-07 18:01:36] <MarvinOGravel> In my undergrad, the homework was necessary to learn the material.
[2022-12-07 18:01:37] <%Cesnik> also depends on the level of education. primary education absolutely, but maybe not depending on the kind of secondary education
[2022-12-07 18:01:38] <bobbyprin> o
[2022-12-07 18:01:39] <%Perico__Jones> Homework is good for people to understand that Learning isn't 8 to 3 , even in life.
[2022-12-07 18:01:39] <%acerek_> homework is part of studying
[2022-12-07 18:01:39] <+nattybohing> Yes, but some teachers over-do it.  It’s only meant to reinforce.
[2022-12-07 18:01:40] <@%$DanTheVP> @sergimon90 There is a difference between someone being religious and a politician VERSUS someone using politics to enforce their religion on other
[2022-12-07 18:01:40] <%$goodwaon> It absolutely helps, practicing thing like math is essential for hammering in concepts
[2022-12-07 18:01:40] <%tweedledip> homework for reinforcement of concepts=good, homework for busy work and to fill in grade percentages=bad
[2022-12-07 18:01:41] <%scarbo87> If you have photographic memory then yes homework works
[2022-12-07 18:01:41] <bobbyprin> r
[2022-12-07 18:01:41] <username_needed_> Isn’t homework to show the teacher that you’ve understood what they taught you?
[2022-12-07 18:01:41] <rentborne> As someone who also taught for a year (HS calculus), my opinion is that the stuff that is done at home really should be the lecture portions of the class, and that school work should be done at school to get assistance from an "expert"
[2022-12-07 18:01:41] <%evanworse> i also give oral tests, though, so...
[2022-12-07 18:01:42] <%+maced2020> Home work is a way to indoctrinate kids in doing work off the clock
[2022-12-07 18:01:43] <+Splatts_mcgee> When I gave homework as a math teacher I allowed sufficient time to complete in class
[2022-12-07 18:01:43] <%+Toasticus> chat has strong opinions, holy fuck
[2022-12-07 18:01:44] <%$rom_eat> my kids homework is always busy work
[2022-12-07 18:01:44] <bobbyprin> s
[2022-12-07 18:01:44] <%JazzkattLive> i dont think it should effect grade
[2022-12-07 18:01:44] <%+edibleaudio> For certain subjects it can help to re-enforce, but it not for everything.
[2022-12-07 18:01:44] <%$jack_of_hertz> in the era of work from home, practicing working at home seems sensible
[2022-12-07 18:01:46] <GenoWilder> I'd be the opposite, I learnt more from homework than the teachers
[2022-12-07 18:01:46] <%+commander_doyle> homework is a scam
[2022-12-07 18:01:47] <zal0k> my kiddo needs it to see the information on her own terms to really get some stuff

[2022-12-07 18:02:06] <%+Thrilllho> I think it can get in the way of living life and turn living into a rat race. So homework can be good if its not taking away all of a person's time to do.

[2022-12-07 18:02:11] <Serchinnho> as a math teacher in university, yes, you NEED homework
[2022-12-07 18:02:12] <%$rom_eat> maybe not a pic pipe

[2022-12-07 18:02:16] <%slipstick73> Practice is good. Proper practice is even better. We don't learn to pole vault by watching someone pole vault over and over...
[2022-12-07 18:02:19] <+nickolok> homework growing up in my school district was busy work like crossword puzzles and word searches
[2022-12-07 18:02:21] <toxicpycnometer> can the p switch make the switch real?

[2022-12-07 18:05:46] <1337boogie> paper mario takes the concept and maeks it 1000  times better
