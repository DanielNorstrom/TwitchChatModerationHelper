[2023-01-03 17:58:05] <+JustcallmeDyno> If you loose to someone twice, then why would you be mad to be on their team? Shouldn't you be happy and excited for a potential win?
[2023-01-03 17:58:08] <A_SquadBroFist> this was the only way to make you lose
[2023-01-03 17:58:12] <eppu_100> you play a lot of champs tho

[2023-01-03 18:04:33] <+xG0DSWRATHx> only low elo people think that. watch high elo players and they see the same crap all the way to challenger
[2023-01-03 18:04:35] <%ItzYaBoi34> I heard there are bots now in bronze
[2023-01-03 18:04:36] <%henrylongfootus> Forest would call plat & Diamond the mental asylum
[2023-01-03 18:04:38] <%+ProjectCrysis> something has to generally be wrong with them if this is fun for them

[2023-01-03 18:10:24] <buclatypan> @丂尺片 Trying to get a revenge is a downward spiral buddy. He be mad already. You be mad more, getting "revenge", makes him angrier (but he's already on breaking point - runs it down), you angrier, then you try to make him even angrier and so on and on. That's why it's toxic.
[2023-01-03 18:10:25] <zstar13> great outlook, people like annie just want to see a 'reaction' narcisist

[2023-01-03 19:02:58] <jack_the_sniper9> Because if u played right away u are going to lay versus good players if u don’t silver people will go to gold and etc

[2023-01-03 19:04:40] <%ToxicDthumper> @teamplay4victory so they aren’t Splitting the season ?
[2023-01-03 19:05:06] <@%teamplay4victory> what has splitting to do with when the season starts?
[2023-01-03 19:05:16] <orrvaa> if they put everyone in silver they should match everyone as if they are in silver
