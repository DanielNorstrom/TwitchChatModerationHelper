[2023-01-03 17:19:11] <@%^StreamElements> @austin9042 The Pipe is called Midwakh, and it is used to smoke Dokha. Dokha is a tobacco product, it consists of finely dried and shredded tobacco along with herbs and spices. It also has different levels depending on the person's liking! Badr uses the Hot version which is the strongest.
