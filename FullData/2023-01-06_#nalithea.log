[2023-01-06 17:31:38] <+DMOC6969> i agree with that like i have 5K hours on bastion and its because i like him (hate the rework with him ) but the game is fun if you dont go so tryhard or serious at it

[2023-01-06 17:48:44] <%ManuKawaii5> moira is more a dps than a healer change my mind
[2023-01-06 17:49:23] <@%Grimstab77> @ManuKawaii5 that's because you said healer. And overwatch doesn't have "healers" but "supports".

[2023-01-06 19:02:25] <%+MALYG0S> So Grim there is an easy way to tell which house you're for. Slitherin is the house for dushbags, Ravenclaw is for the logical and quite people, Hufflepuff is for the aloof and friendly ones and Griffindor is for the proud and freewilled
[2023-01-06 19:03:01] <%Subconscious__> The only true way to know which house you belong in is through the sorting hat nalithPopcorn nalithPopcorn nalithHehe

[2023-01-06 19:24:55] <Lairfeyra> nali just ask her if she wants to play with you, i think she will be happy, i mean she invited you to rl stuff, so i think the vibe is good
[2023-01-06 19:24:58] <%farhood3000> so if i become a vtuber i would become cute?
[2023-01-06 19:24:58] <%+MALYG0S> Well anonymosity is the biggest reason for a lot of VTubers
