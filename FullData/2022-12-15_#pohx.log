I noticed you spec out of inc AoE nodes on the tree and on stream I heard you mention you may spec out of the ascendancy that gives you aoe per endurance charge. The pob doesn't use awakened inc aoe gem either, so I am a bit confused on how much aoe I should have for comfy clear

[2022-12-15 17:15:38] <+eljay1026> I had a minion attack damage - but that does NOT apply - right?
[2022-12-15 17:15:43] <@%lemoncoolers> ask yourself: does "increased damage" affect RF and firetrap? Yes. Yes it does.

[2022-12-15 17:16:28] <+eljay1026> @lemoncoolers but "attack damage" doesn't apply to RF, right? or am I not understanding that vs just "increased damage"

[2022-12-15 17:17:14] <@%GoGoLoThirty> @eljay1026 correct attack damage is not relevant for RF. counterintuitively, Spell Damage also does not apply. check pohx.net
[2022-12-15 17:17:15] <Strollein> I mean you cant really blame new people when they ask the same question for the 100th time when they dont know the question has been asked 99 times already LUL
[2022-12-15 17:17:23] <@%lemoncoolers> @thefoffo it can drop still but removing them may help
[2022-12-15 17:17:28] <+eljay1026> @lemoncoolers  I don't think it was a septer specifically, just some piece of gear

[2022-12-15 19:09:27] <wycratius> Hi Chat - I'm currently sitting at 81 in white maps and I'm about out of currency trying to off color 4-links.  I've got 20C should I just resort to trade to find what I need or keep farming maps in hopes of better drops, currently I have only 1 good 4L for RF
[2022-12-15 19:09:37] <+Dyrend> has anyone tried the skitterbots temporal chains for sanctum runs?

[2022-12-15 19:10:06] <+warmonger210> @wycratius are you trying to off colour straight up armour? or hybrid pieces?

[2022-12-15 19:10:17] <Ahmose_> @wycratius what base is that
[2022-12-15 19:10:32] <@%+fmsttv> @wycratius easiest way is to just buy a 4L early if u can't get what you want, normally u should save your currency for crafting end game, as RF build is very tanky just from your tree, gear doesn't matter a whole lot when your just doing white maps. imho

[2022-12-15 19:14:00] <@%+fmsttv> @wycratius put it this way, I like crafting, but i probably spent three times as much currency on 'crafting' an item, that I could of used to just purchase an almost identical version.  with GGG's update with loot, loot is MUCH cheaper and more available to lower content.

[2022-12-15 19:19:12] <@%lemoncoolers> @Freaker4o there's always more you can do to invest in explode of course. The flask just lets you throw it on and pop packs.

[2022-12-15 20:01:34] <+Martintin11> Hey guys just started playing RF and i was wondering why you needed a rruby flask even with fire res caped ?
[2022-12-15 20:01:36] <0izo> i kinda dont understand how Saffells frame gives me more dps than Dawnbreaker
[2022-12-15 20:01:36] <madvillanyyy> @mab0913 its still great to use
[2022-12-15 20:01:51] <@%lemoncoolers> @Martintin11 it reduces fire damage taken which means you regen faster
[2022-12-15 20:01:53] <eraInferno> @Martintin11 less dmg taken read the flask
[2022-12-15 20:01:57] <0izo> thought "+ spell dmg" doesnt count for RF?

[2022-12-15 21:10:27] <MustDy> @Pohx , regarding RF Jugg. Is it worth going for Ashes amulet, or better stick to the rare? (it is fine to farm for it for me) With Ashes it is possible to fit Vitality without Arrogance (with Enlighten)

[2022-12-15 21:14:44] <%Bloody_Gosu> HUH

[2022-12-15 21:15:13] <+juniorbatalhabr> what is the name of this mechanic that appears 2 pillars with 2 choices?
[2022-12-15 21:15:13] <Strollein> Well in this case it might be the problem that newer people dont know how important ailment immunities are
[2022-12-15 21:15:17] <PrimeBlackDodo> PoE is a game that is all about learning besides following the guide. READ what you do in g ame with gems and gear and such. Or you will never learn.
[2022-12-15 21:15:18] <%CrypticalReasoning> I feel ya, have friends that play Poe for 6+ leagues without reading their gems/passives and so on
[2022-12-15 21:15:18] <+Derpstar42> just make it part of the FAQ if its not there and then you can just say read the website

[2022-12-15 21:18:34] <$LazyActor> well your guide is the most new player hand holdy of any of the guides, it really is superb the amount of detail you can get from the wiki you made. so much so that it attracts mainly new players and no matter how clear and easy you make it there is only so much new shit someone can learn at one time. they just need time.

[2022-12-15 21:22:24] <+antonhavree> I've got a small feedback of something you can add to the notes of the PoB, add that you kill all bandits and the 2 main pantheons you use.

[2022-12-15 21:23:32] <+CaldoDeLuca> I had that same question and all I did was look at the pob with attention and eventually found the answer
[2022-12-15 21:23:37] <+antonhavree> I can't see anything of the pantheons in the notes. But could also be me being blind..

[2022-12-15 21:24:07] <@%+fmsttv> brother, I"m following your guide to a T, and i'm almost 95 which I've never hit before in a season, your guides are fine, people just need to read and use their brain, which some people wont, its unfortunate but happens.
[2022-12-15 21:24:10] <Redpainwolf> there is no info on minor pantheons

[2022-12-15 21:38:00] <%+Mr_Titan253> @Salvicta Kirac will sometimes have a mission to complete a lab trial, that'll guarantee the spawn
[2022-12-15 21:38:25] <Salvicta> @kindoramns and do the trials Look like the knes in the campaign?
[2022-12-15 21:38:31] <%Kindoramns> sounds like map trials are bugged so I'd suggest looking at other league content like rituals, tujen expedition, or delerium

[2022-12-15 21:49:35] <+LightcallerTV> Ah i saw a leveling mapping strat revoling around blue maps today
[2022-12-15 21:50:02] <doesbaddl> can I run RF+lifetap+swift affliction if I have nothing else that has lifetap (ruthless)?
[2022-12-15 21:50:02] <darkpundapower> Exarch alter rewards just seem more consistent

[2022-12-15 21:51:07] <%lilslaske> Do u have plans on running some bosses before switching to SSF like last league? I still remember u getting that perfect rolled ashes
[2022-12-15 21:51:09] <utterlycyan> @Pohx do you think cold dot elementalist could reach the same level of walking simulator as rf  with new flask?
[2022-12-15 21:51:09] <doesbaddl> can I run RF+lifetap+swift affliction if I have nothing else that has lifetap (ruthless)?
[2022-12-15 21:51:29] <%+Matcha0515> reduce aura + ele weak is a skip for me
[2022-12-15 21:51:44] <%bEC69_> I know you still not gonna run it but -max is not enough to scratch a jugg, I'm runing in in ssf for 1/10 of your jugg's power KEKL jug op
[2022-12-15 21:52:00] <Strollein> but dont you want clusters for fan the flames and such?
[2022-12-15 21:52:07] <Luniaril> How was the density compared to this, on the build with no grand design but with scarab pack size node?
[2022-12-15 21:52:22] <poison_rf_deadeye> I think exposure is also higher this league
[2022-12-15 21:52:24] <%+Matcha0515> @doesbaddl you won't have your lifetap buff swift works i think

[2022-12-15 22:28:37] <justsedricplease> and you can always tech in a bleed flask if you want to
[2022-12-15 22:28:48] <%Motarkus> if you happen to survive the explosion you get really fcked up.. right

[2022-12-15 23:52:55] <@%GoGoLoThirty> this is a pretty 5Head strat you gotta give yourself more credit

[2022-12-15 23:52:57] <+Lappenforce> how good is RF on bossing?
[2022-12-15 23:53:05] <@%GoGoLoThirty> the cocaine and the expedition and the delirium orbs, its pretty legit lol

[2022-12-15 23:54:04] <@%GoGoLoThirty> hm I think the currency thing is all about like ROI rather than capital though. cause even if a juice strat is high level if its very straightforward for returns then its pretty simple/easy accessible no?
[2022-12-15 23:54:05] <+Dizzlekrew> do you have a video about the syndicate? This is my first league I've made it to end game and idk how to do the unveil stuff best.

[2022-12-15 23:55:42] <+Pipnotiq> You should see if you can get the entirety of a logbook into one area and kaboom it
[2022-12-15 23:55:53] <%jibanthamum> Vorici is the one who has to be in research right?
[2022-12-15 23:56:13] <@%GoGoLoThirty> @GoGoLoThirty I want to say everything but really if you just have the top right and the center then you're pretty good to go! you can sell logbooks and do as much tujen/gwen as you want with that and rusted scarabs :)
[2022-12-15 23:56:13] <+haroldcarefree> Vorici in research gives white sockets yeah
