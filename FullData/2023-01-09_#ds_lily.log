[2023-01-09 18:14:30] <teoati> When a curse expires, Doom Blast activates. So, you need to use +1 more curse above your limit. The first curse from Vixen gloves is canceled, then Doom Blast starts. Works with Cursed Ground too.

[2023-01-09 21:48:47] <rixaN_> logically it should be you have 0 physical reduction
[2023-01-09 21:48:55] <!%Bisholio> and the only things on it in terms of dmg were overwhelm and phys as chaos
[2023-01-09 21:48:55] <rixaN_> but its poe so maybe not
[2023-01-09 21:48:58] <%cyanne112> overwhelm is basically phys spell pen

[2023-01-09 21:49:03] <%cyanne112> it works jsut as spell pen
[2023-01-09 21:49:07] <+TheRivenBlade> overwhelm is phys pen essentially
[2023-01-09 21:49:07] <theFufuu> 10%
[2023-01-09 21:49:15] <%Mom_Online> overwhelm is penetration but it can't go negative
[2023-01-09 21:49:16] <rixaN_> overwhelm works exactly as it should but mobs only have a base amount so it can't go negative
[2023-01-09 21:49:17] <wefookenlostman> ye
[2023-01-09 21:49:24] <wefookenlostman> Overwhelm is a property of hits that ignores a set amount of the target's physical damage reduction.
[2023-01-09 21:49:24] <rixaN_> so you only need like 30% for mobs to have 0
[2023-01-09 21:49:33] <!%Bisholio> yeah so if they have 100% overwhelm, i would have 0 armor?
[2023-01-09 21:49:37] <rixaN_> so giving mobs 100% overwhelm is big dam

[2023-01-09 21:50:35] <E1ppa> I think your armour calcs to some % of phys redo. Then it adds up to your flat phys redo. and then "overwhelm" value is substracted
[2023-01-09 21:50:37] <wraque> So when you do logbooks, don't take the overwhelm remnants

[2023-01-09 23:38:29] <intball00> yeah paak has the answer

[2023-01-09 23:38:38] <%MuffinWasTaken> am i dumb? u only have 2 curse limit, ur missing whispers

[2023-01-09 23:38:45] <+th3mpire> they play it as a troll to get others to play it
[2023-01-09 23:38:51] <SiCkWoOd88> you might need more cast speed
[2023-01-09 23:39:00] <intball00> i think cdr is the fix
[2023-01-09 23:39:02] <%MuffinWasTaken> where is the 3rd from?
[2023-01-09 23:39:04] <SiCkWoOd88> i think this is the problem ziz had
[2023-01-09 23:39:05] <intball00> unironically
[2023-01-09 23:39:05] <wraque> We should put gyrotex on the job
[2023-01-09 23:39:09] <hloride> need 3 max curses with gloves
[2023-01-09 23:39:12] <intball00> because doom blast has a cd
[2023-01-09 23:39:19] <%+LanceFT> just self cast tempchains
[2023-01-09 23:39:20] <evanmcmastar> @wraque one from ascendency, one from gloves, and one base
[2023-01-09 23:39:21] <intball00> it only pops from 1 cast bc of thr overlap
[2023-01-09 23:39:26] <SiCkWoOd88> you have too cast your curse before the vixens cast goes off or somehtign like that
[2023-01-09 23:39:27] <%+LanceFT> temp chains in 6link
[2023-01-09 23:39:29] <intball00> so i think you need cdr
[2023-01-09 23:39:30] <%+laxwal> only way it hits with one cast without woke is if the reg spell cascade overlaps
[2023-01-09 23:39:30] <%+LanceFT> over despair

[2023-01-09 23:42:05] <Jukage01> idk how u managed to do it xD it worked for me since lvl 37 when i got my vixen in
[2023-01-09 23:42:11] <%+GrumpyTommmy> And with a lot of cast speed and cdr you wont even mind to quickly cast it 3 times.
[2023-01-09 23:42:12] <%LordTekkless> i remember doing untainteds with him
[2023-01-09 23:42:12] <SiCkWoOd88> try faster casting in 1 of the links and see what happens, thats what ziz did for the having to double cast, or jus message gucci and ask him
[2023-01-09 23:42:15] <%+LanceFT> most use temp chains  not despair
[2023-01-09 23:42:16] <+Dia_1982> Aren't you supposed to have temp chains in chest links?

[2023-01-09 23:42:23] <+wariows> I think CDR is only important if you  have more than 4 casts per sec
[2023-01-09 23:42:24] <zombilaufanneymar> Didnt it say something about cursor placement?
[2023-01-09 23:42:42] <SiCkWoOd88> he said the same thing
