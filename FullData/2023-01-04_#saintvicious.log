[2023-01-04 00:45:50] <%Slamm> tbh I would have played hacker over oxforce there, and I asked why you did otherwise to change my mind and learn

[2023-01-04 22:30:05] <%+Codename_Duchess> i think at the core charisma is your ability to get others to follow you. leaders are inherently charismatic because of this

[2023-01-04 23:46:47] <+uberspidey> I was about to ask if gunblade is usually better than BT but didn't realize it was an accident KEKW
[2023-01-04 23:46:59] <%+coolz85> he tried for BT
[2023-01-04 23:47:07] <+BixodoAtaque> why is gunblade so much worse than BT?
[2023-01-04 23:47:09] <+pinkpuffles> Depredge
[2023-01-04 23:47:37] <%Louisthexv> stone plate for riv maybe?

[2023-01-04 23:47:55] <%+coolz85> I think it's because it's only every 3rd auto that hurts more, BT gives more value every 2/3 auto's
[2023-01-04 23:48:11] <Drainus> gunblade lowkey better
