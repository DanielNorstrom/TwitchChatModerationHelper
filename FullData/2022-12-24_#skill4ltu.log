[2022-12-24 14:07:27] <aleximan3> this tank is so much worse than T56. At least skoda T56 had large weakspots. Caliban wasn't that accurate. It's tank is just too much powerful, you just can't do anything against him, just taking 800. Even in Tig II i'm struggling to penetrate. The funniest thing is that the tank has gun depre :/

[2022-12-24 14:50:18] <%+deadlad_wot> @skill4ltu and chat, i really dont feel like ruining the christmas spirit but i want to share it with you because it will make me feel better. Im not sure if you remember, i have an uncle that served in polish army. He has sadly passed away today. He meant a lot to me, he was my mothers only brother. The medics tried to resucitate him but they sadly failed. This is the worst christmas ever, sorry again if i ruined the spirit :(

[2022-12-24 18:08:43] <%Kedare9999> @skill4ltu I watched your latest video and that one was one of a kind battle. Also, very interesting concept for video. Two different perspectives with big plot twist at the end. One thing i noticed. Two perspectives should be timed so both would happend at same time. I think i would help with the flow of the video and i would be even better, you can consider this to implement in future videos. Thanks for great content, video was skil10

[2022-12-24 21:05:40] <socialgeograf> Vz 176, this is a Tank with "the function of throwing wooden poles from power lines". With the possibility of "launching a salvo installation from the rear". This is exactly what was "really missing". I wonder what will happen next? I hope that no one will come up with the idea of "Introducing salvo artillery"....

[2022-12-24 21:37:32] <+AbralincHamCone> @skill4ltu I used to play a game called Asheron's Call and there was a bug in the game which meant that some players had worse luck than others. Maybe WoT developers made a similar mistake ;)

[2022-12-24 21:39:22] <WoTWhirls> @skill4ltu - But when you don't have anonymizer u get the baboons raising the guns, which could be free damage for you technically
[2022-12-24 21:39:23] <+FarekP> twin towers Kappa
[2022-12-24 21:39:27] <polik__xd> i dont think that is the anonymizer issue

[2022-12-24 21:39:30] <+senkisem16> dancers steal a lot of dmg also some play differently when they see u are skill @skill4ltu

[2022-12-24 21:39:39] <Deminutiv> skill issue? Kappa
[2022-12-24 21:39:39] <%tvrzna> 56 battles is not a significant statistic sample
[2022-12-24 21:39:42] <$F0R_M07H3R_RU5514> you are truly demonstrating that RNG for MM and shots is NOT TRULY RANDOM ... it impacts accounts differentely

[2022-12-24 21:39:46] <@^StreamElements> Are you interested in Skill's Favourite Tier X Tanks? Just check out this YT playlist: shorturl.at/cMS78
[2022-12-24 21:39:48] <Drunkard_Tanker> maybe individual skill is an illusion and it's all predetermined by Wargaming.
[2022-12-24 21:39:48] <Mr__AN0NYM0US> but you are having bad RNG. nothing to do with anonymizer so far tbh

[2022-12-24 21:39:54] <%+Durmanush> @skill4ltu you didn't buy as many lootboxes in this account that is your problem
[2022-12-24 21:39:54] <G0urami> @skill4ltu After 4K battles, I turned on anonymiser AND hide MoE, i got better AND i dont get targeted as much.. XVM can be a pain
[2022-12-24 21:39:54] <+pyroprick> @skill4ltu its because of your sweater, BZ is at bottom of chimney LUL
[2022-12-24 21:39:57] <warbeastn> I will use anilyzer too now

[2022-12-24 21:40:12] <Ocara115> I use randomizer so people that use xvm cant harass me for having lower stats than they do
[2022-12-24 21:40:14] <!%PeterBFS> @skill4ltu  Same  equiped ?
[2022-12-24 21:40:14] <%teppotunari> @tvrzna usually when i play less games with a tank for example 10 i have better statistics than if i played 100
[2022-12-24 21:40:14] <warbeastn> People focus good player
[2022-12-24 21:40:18] <geaniyz> @skill4ltu maybe this happens because there are more players on the game now since is Christmas ?
[2022-12-24 21:40:28] <%bikercbr1000rr> anonymizer is for tinfoil hat wearers
[2022-12-24 21:40:37] <warbeastn> Arti also focus good player
