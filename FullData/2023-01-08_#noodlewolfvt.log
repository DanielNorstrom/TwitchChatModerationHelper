[2023-01-08 21:53:43] <Soyama_akaza> @NoodleWolfVT  If your first like native language is English, then what is your second language and what other languages can you learn? because from my perspective its really weird, because our first language is our "native" that we learn all the time ofc and our second language is English that we learn from 2nd grade, and then on Highschool we get to choose another 3rd language.. So Iam just really confused of how this works in English speaking countries kyaninKEK

[2023-01-08 23:52:04] <stratosedge> I don't know how you do it but even the triggers you do don't sound too harsh. Some asmrist make really harsh sounds which take you out of the experience. It usually is not intend by them though, I guess it's about figuring out the right settings.
