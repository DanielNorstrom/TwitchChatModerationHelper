[2022-12-07 17:35:48] <@%zeekbt_dores> ok new idea for ladder matches. When you win, the losing player/team picks how many ELO you gain/they lose, but that then becomes the stake in their next match
[2022-12-07 17:35:48] <%+andymandering> gotta get that win rate back down to 69
[2022-12-07 17:35:48] <aukrofe207> HOW CAN U PLAY FOR SUCH LONG WITH SO MUCH ACTIVITY ?
