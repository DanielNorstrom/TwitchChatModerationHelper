[2022-12-19 00:02:25] <khuchten> !Bloodlust
[2022-12-19 00:02:25] <@^Nightbot> You were 100% winning that without bloodlust lol. You can’t be a good player if you don’t realise that. You had the board against aggro Druid. You realise that means you win right?
[2022-12-19 00:02:42] <gravitas3k> tentacles screwed you like a Lovecraftian sex cult
[2022-12-19 00:03:00] <AceSpectre> He's no longer NoBeardGamer!! How long have I not been here? 😅🤣
[2022-12-19 00:04:02] <%+Razorbam> I love playing the DeadDraw mage  in this meta even if the deck don't have new cards
[2022-12-19 00:04:57] <gravitas3k> too much skill
[2022-12-19 00:05:04] <bigbaguette_69> everything is interesting about beard
[2022-12-19 00:05:07] <soulsmanic> where are eggs? DansGame

[2022-12-19 00:06:08] <gravitas3k> on friday you were over 60% win rate I think. just regression to the mean or you think a slight meta shift?
[2022-12-19 00:07:16] <SnorkyARC> 53% winrate means you are just throwing a coin Sadge
[2022-12-19 00:08:52] <NylonIntruder> Let the value FLOW
[2022-12-19 00:09:21] <minerwator> 53% in for example poker is huge in long term
[2022-12-19 00:10:03] <@%lass_leah> counterspell? I hardly knew her ... spell
[2022-12-19 00:10:13] <%swisshobo> U played around counterspell..
[2022-12-19 00:12:12] <IronfistHS> how do you not rock the beard overall? do you not like it?
[2022-12-19 00:12:48] <NylonIntruder> He likely meant all the time
[2022-12-19 00:12:52] <%+Mr_M0jo> the beard, it is rocked
[2022-12-19 00:13:13] <@%lass_leah> are you rocking the beard, or is the beard rocking you evoThink
[2022-12-19 00:13:29] <%orkonkel> what's the sex cult's opinion about the beard?
[2022-12-19 00:13:33] <bigbaguette_69> polls have been made. .
[2022-12-19 00:13:39] <bigbaguette_69> beard won
[2022-12-19 00:14:10] <+drop_table_subs> If you're swole you gotta post shirtless pics then

[2022-12-19 00:18:09] <+drop_table_subs> Don't to anabolcs to TRT
[2022-12-19 00:18:20] <Murilololo> is it easy to get steroids in the US?
[2022-12-19 00:18:24] <gravitas3k> but the fitness influencers need to pretend to be natural. juice or don't either way but don't lie about it
[2022-12-19 00:18:24] <OurYoungHero> Yes.
[2022-12-19 00:18:34] <coiax> My whole body is covered in muscle required to move my bones
[2022-12-19 00:18:35] <+ucdchris1> steroids got buffed int he last patch Kappa
[2022-12-19 00:18:38] <Ogrr8> yeh, people can make their own
[2022-12-19 00:18:44] <%+The_monster_hunter> Its not always about looking good, its for success in whatever field they go into
[2022-12-19 00:19:02] <+pennybagz90> I wanna be an MD/PhD

[2022-12-19 00:20:15] <grimBleeper> Kappa / raise your hand if you're here to streamsnipe nohands
[2022-12-19 00:20:37] <%+The_monster_hunter> Did you watch that 73 minute Priest mirrior finale for worlds? @NoHandsGamer
[2022-12-19 00:20:49] <NylonIntruder> I remember that one guy who opened Jalex's stream on his stream
[2022-12-19 00:20:57] <NylonIntruder> LUL
[2022-12-19 00:21:02] <%+Mr_M0jo> 73 minutes?
[2022-12-19 00:21:06] <Norwis_> @nylonintruder jayhuang?
[2022-12-19 00:21:16] <%rexmkh> 73 mins of priest poggers
[2022-12-19 00:21:16] <PaladinIRL> I’ve done the math and with all the wins I’ve gotten from stream sniping nohands I accumulated enough packs for 69 meta decks, it’s free real estate
[2022-12-19 00:21:20] <NylonIntruder> @Norwis_ I think so yeah
[2022-12-19 00:21:32] <Ogrr8> smol wong
[2022-12-19 00:21:41] <NylonIntruder> I feel like it would make you worse at hearthstone overall
[2022-12-19 00:21:45] <%rexmkh> i feel like that stuff catches up to you in life tho
[2022-12-19 00:21:54] <Norwis_> And He still got bundles to giveaway from Blizzard:D
[2022-12-19 00:23:24] <OurYoungHero> Are we still talking about steroids?
[2022-12-19 00:23:42] <+ucdchris1> well u would be listening to ur opponents thinking process so that does help ytou learn
[2022-12-19 00:23:44] <Norwis_> it lowers your self considence once you have to play without cheating
[2022-12-19 00:23:57] <gravitas3k> some other card games have built in replays where you can see both players deck lists. that was nice to see and improve
[2022-12-19 00:23:59] <%rexmkh> @Norwis_ +1
[2022-12-19 00:24:01] <+hilaryisthedevil> i spent 10k on this deck and went no where, then i spent 1k on aggro druid and climbed ran3 to lengend in 2 hours
[2022-12-19 00:24:08] <NylonIntruder> Yeah

[2022-12-19 00:25:56] <+Scullythekid> My b, you right
[2022-12-19 00:25:57] <Norwis_> they clearly nerf control priest, boon Priest didnt even make it to finals cause it sucks OpieOP
[2022-12-19 00:26:01] <Agyambagyam> ctrl priest is fine, except quest priest. Why? Cuz bias. Fuck quest priest
[2022-12-19 00:26:12] <@%lass_leah> unleash fel to 2 seems reasonable
[2022-12-19 00:26:13] <%rexmkh> making unleash fel not go face makes it much weaker
[2022-12-19 00:26:15] <+ucdchris1> if felfire doesnt hit face, then u arent at 20 ish life when they combo u
[2022-12-19 00:26:15] <+BattleBean2> Make the quest cost 2
[2022-12-19 00:26:19] <+drop_table_subs> Make quest steps harder? make lifesteal hit friendlies?
[2022-12-19 00:26:19] <@%lass_leah> reddit wants to kill the card and make it only minions
[2022-12-19 00:26:31] <%rexmkh> they could raise its cost to 2 or 3, which doesn't entirely kill the card
[2022-12-19 00:26:36] <+Aquatic_Sloth> quest reward: increase the cost of cards drawn by (1)
[2022-12-19 00:26:55] <+BattleBean2> I’d like to see them buff some Agro cards
[2022-12-19 00:26:57] <%+Mr_M0jo> You midas well

[2022-12-19 00:27:57] <Agyambagyam> 4 mana deal 9 to all enemy minions YEP
[2022-12-19 00:28:06] <%rexmkh> i feel like ghoul dr rogue might be less highrolly if the 5/8 demon was reduced to a 5/6
[2022-12-19 00:28:40] <gravitas3k> it would be nice instead of nerfs they buffed some other cards that never ever see play
[2022-12-19 00:28:43] <grimBleeper> YEP enemy should be playing river crocolisks and razorfen hunters
[2022-12-19 00:28:59] <Norwis_> can't Wait for them to Nerf one of Rogue archetypes So people will just switch to another tier 1 Rogue version HypeSleep

[2022-12-19 00:34:47] <NylonIntruder> Yeah we dont need to kill them, merely break their spirit
[2022-12-19 00:34:56] <+drop_table_subs> When their life points go down you're winning
[2022-12-19 00:35:31] <!%pocket_train> Sadge no egg, betrayed by streamer

[2022-12-19 00:36:11] <%+Mr_M0jo> I just now thought of what NGH's "What?" reminds me of: when Darth Vader's escort is shot by Han Solo so Luke can blow up the Death Star
[2022-12-19 00:36:26] <NylonIntruder> hahaha
[2022-12-19 00:36:26] <+ucdchris1> i wonder what ur plague hit
[2022-12-19 00:36:29] <khuchten> Wintrade KEKWait
[2022-12-19 00:36:31] <+ucdchris1> maybe it hit the 0 1
[2022-12-19 00:36:35] <gravitas3k> probably hit Astalor with the plague
[2022-12-19 00:36:35] <%rexmkh> 73 minute priest mirror denied :(
[2022-12-19 00:36:49] <+Ryukinshin> I'd give up on priest mirror too. Priest mirror is awful
[2022-12-19 00:36:50] <portugues01> he thought .. i might just go play vs other classes , he gets 3 games during that time
[2022-12-19 00:37:20] <khuchten> "I saw what happend at world get me the fuck outta here
[2022-12-19 00:37:52] <portugues01> @khuchten whatchu mean
[2022-12-19 00:38:14] <NylonIntruder> The final match wasa  really long priest mirror
[2022-12-19 00:38:25] <portugues01> how many minutes
[2022-12-19 00:38:39] <NylonIntruder> 73 apparently
[2022-12-19 00:38:52] <portugues01> LULW !!! fuck that ,  just concede and go next
[2022-12-19 00:38:58] <meteospasmyl> someone made a post on hearthstone subreddit ranting about control priest, lmao
[2022-12-19 00:38:59] <portugues01> concede at finals <3
[2022-12-19 00:39:14] <NylonIntruder> Which consisted mainly of drowns and identitity thefts
[2022-12-19 00:39:26] <portugues01> where can i watch that game
[2022-12-19 00:39:30] <NylonIntruder> I think 6 or 7 Xyrella heros were palyed
[2022-12-19 00:39:38] <NylonIntruder> Youtube
[2022-12-19 00:39:41] <+ucdchris1> did u watch the priest mirror in the final game of worlds?
[2022-12-19 00:39:43] <portugues01> ..ok name
[2022-12-19 00:39:56] <NylonIntruder> Search Hearthstone Worlds, its the last game
[2022-12-19 00:40:02] <portugues01> OK !
[2022-12-19 00:40:27] <portugues01> 1day ago ? @NoHandsGamer
[2022-12-19 00:40:30] <portugues01> opps.. wrong person
[2022-12-19 00:40:46] <NylonIntruder> It was like 10-12 hours ago roughly
[2022-12-19 00:41:05] <NylonIntruder> Disruption always best
[2022-12-19 00:41:11] <hammer1234> cathedral
[2022-12-19 00:41:24] <NylonIntruder> Either they burn removal
[2022-12-19 00:41:34] <sinjako3> i think watchpost because if he is unlucky he might have to use arcane spell and ping to clear it which is very good for you, but the 3 drop he can maybe easily ignore
[2022-12-19 00:41:44] <NylonIntruder> Or they get a ton of mana cost increases
[2022-12-19 00:42:04] <azreal3356> if you aren't actively building the next best thing is to disrupt your opponent until you're in your stride. dead turns=dead player
[2022-12-19 00:42:10] <portugues01> is BLOOD DK  strong   or weak ? vs other classes
[2022-12-19 00:42:31] <NylonIntruder> Yeah thats 3 dmg not going face
[2022-12-19 00:42:50] <NylonIntruder> Blood DK has no mana cheating
[2022-12-19 00:42:53] <+Ryukinshin> weak tbh, blood DK doesn't really have a clear win condition.
[2022-12-19 00:43:02] <NylonIntruder> So it gets ran over by decks that do cheat mana
[2022-12-19 00:44:35] <+zac_rules> yoooooo, where are all the eggs? deck tracker still says your deck is called Breakfast Priest, but no eggs 🥚😭
[2022-12-19 00:44:59] <NylonIntruder> Quest DH is mana cheating
[2022-12-19 00:45:09] <portugues01> so DK is low tier now?
[2022-12-19 00:45:14] <NylonIntruder> Yes
[2022-12-19 00:45:15] <NylonIntruder> LUL
[2022-12-19 00:45:19] <dendaihs> @zac_rules we eat Finley now
[2022-12-19 00:45:21] <NylonIntruder> Right fair
[2022-12-19 00:45:34] <%+saa_soli> patchwork deletes like 40% of dh's minions :(
[2022-12-19 00:45:38] <portugues01> i assume BLOOD DK is the strongest of all dk types , right ?
[2022-12-19 00:45:43] <%+Aalardin> What is the best desk and why is it renathal shockspitter hunter?
[2022-12-19 00:45:52] <%+Aalardin> Deck 😓
[2022-12-19 00:46:02] <NylonIntruder> @portugues01 Prolly Frost
[2022-12-19 00:46:05] <+cosmic_yeti> i went on like a 23-2 win streak with frost
[2022-12-19 00:46:13] <NylonIntruder> It at least has a valid kill strategy
[2022-12-19 00:46:15] <portugues01> frost stronger than blood? oh ok
[2022-12-19 00:46:57] <portugues01> Frost is the best archtype ? @NoHandsGamer
[2022-12-19 00:47:07] <+lolalex4d> so i presume its gonna get buffed no?
[2022-12-19 00:47:23] <lightfreeze_hs> it should be okay against bless priest, asphyxiate is a strong removal against them
[2022-12-19 00:47:27] <+Ryukinshin> I imagine the best against deathrattle rogue is priest or evo shaman
[2022-12-19 00:47:28] <%+scotch1986> dk will see a few buffs I’d assume
[2022-12-19 00:47:28] <sinjako3> @NoHandsGamer  the closest blood dk ever got to beating me as death rattle rogue without silence ended way late in the game with a 35 corpse corpse explosion failing to clear the ghouls xD
[2022-12-19 00:47:41] <Eriadar> I had 4-1 as blood DK vs control priest today, is that really that bad of a matchup for DK? I know, small sample size, but it felt like kinda easy matchup @NoHandsGamer
[2022-12-19 00:47:54] <opain1990> Dont unwant to shave ur beard
[2022-12-19 00:47:55] <azreal3356> does filling my heart with child like wonder at something new count as doing something well @NoHandsGamer
[2022-12-19 00:48:09] <opain1990> KonCha
[2022-12-19 00:48:30] <sinjako3> priest max hp is 40 tho
[2022-12-19 00:48:38] <sinjako3> i like big number on my health
[2022-12-19 00:48:45] <+BattleBean2> Unholy death knight feels so cool…I wish it wasn’t such garbage
[2022-12-19 00:48:55] <NylonIntruder> No one is saying not to play DK
[2022-12-19 00:48:57] <+ucdchris1> this is where the mage goes mass poly right?
[2022-12-19 00:49:09] <opain1990> My ultimate blood dk deck wins vs all
[2022-12-19 00:49:55] <Agyambagyam> Honestly alexandros is like the only reason blood DK can win in ctrl matchups
[2022-12-19 00:49:59] <lightfreeze_hs> also unholy works better as being the faster aggressor, if you ever went to 9 mana as UH means you are losing
[2022-12-19 00:50:28] <Eriadar> @Agyambagyam you can say the same about mi'da in priest tho
[2022-12-19 00:50:49] <+Ryukinshin> I like how dawngrasp's hero power still says "+2 damage" for honorable kill but it's actually +1
[2022-12-19 00:50:57] <minerwator> im not convinced priest is as good as you claim
[2022-12-19 00:51:11] <NylonIntruder> Also it doesnt help it was released at the end of a year isntead of the begining
[2022-12-19 00:51:21] <lightfreeze_hs> tbh it would have felt terrible in stormwind era
[2022-12-19 00:51:35] <Agyambagyam> @Eriadar eh, I don't think so. svalna, quest is just two others off the top of my head

[2022-12-19 00:54:18] <khuchten> Control is fun until you have to play mirror nothing new, mirror in general suck
[2022-12-19 00:54:43] <+AshKenchum> yea which is why playing uncommon but pretty good decks is so fun

[2022-12-19 00:55:45] <+Ryukinshin> I think it's more people don't see the value in playing out a 70 minute game when they could clear 3-4 wins in the same amount of time elsewhere.

[2022-12-19 00:56:51] <OurYoungHero> Was it right to buff there? Couldn't you have waited until this turn to take 2 less?
[2022-12-19 00:56:56] <gravitas3k> these games leave impressions and calls for rogue to get nerfed but these are not the common case. i think rogue is kind of fine where it is
[2022-12-19 00:57:12] <Eriadar> @Ryukinshin it depends on why do ppl play... I personally play to have fun and beat my opponent, not necessarily climb fast... and I really love control mirrors.

[2022-12-19 00:59:22] <Tahoth> Its a game, the value is "having fun" not "getting the most wins". For some people maybe those overlap, but not everyone

[2022-12-19 01:09:11] <+hilaryisthedevil> shouldn't you compare the expected value of the time youd spend in the game to the expected value of getting to start another game early
[2022-12-19 01:09:12] <+Khaonic> You're right he could have a heart attack mid game
[2022-12-19 01:09:17] <ofte> your opponent can always blunder/missplay too
[2022-12-19 01:09:20] <ShaTheOne> its also good experience, so there is value in it even if you dont win
[2022-12-19 01:09:22] <Agyambagyam> except when that one win is a disgusting engine line with a 18 move long combination that gets an obsucre endgame which played perfectly with max resistance will yield a win

[2022-12-19 01:16:20] <Eriadar> Ok, mby I wrote it wrong, so let me ask you then, what was the possible win condition for you in that game (after their insane start)? In my mind your deck doesn't have any RNG potential (like thief rogue for example)? As I said, I donť concede often and I don't get why are you taking this to the real life stuff when there is 0 connection (atleast for me).

[2022-12-19 01:16:20] <+Tinyfred> Agreed
[2022-12-19 01:16:23] <$deadly_bunnies> if you can't walk, just roll
[2022-12-19 01:16:29] <+Tinyfred> You're a big inspiration mate
[2022-12-19 01:16:33] <+Tinyfred> Good on you
[2022-12-19 01:16:34] <ThisSilhouetteLie> tl;dr they hit it off
[2022-12-19 01:16:40] <+DrEvil69I> i have second life, what are you even talking about Kappa
[2022-12-19 01:16:49] <SadLH> guys.. this priest plays eggs pelecans and NEVER QUEST.. and you wonder why he never concedes???
[2022-12-19 01:16:57] <+DrEvil69I> MYAA i have 7 lives MyAvatar
[2022-12-19 01:17:04] <+Tinyfred> Good thing you're not French @NoHandsGamer
[2022-12-19 01:17:13] <+Tinyfred> LUL
[2022-12-19 01:17:18] <Fluxcone> So basically, Conceding is like killing yourself
[2022-12-19 01:17:24] <Fluxcone> Kappa
[2022-12-19 01:17:27] <+ucdchris1> look how well it worked out with the concede angle in ww2 for france Kappa
[2022-12-19 01:17:39] <TimmY_PranksteR> It's just a game Kappa
[2022-12-19 01:17:53] <Cantelope> Rip eggs zeddyNotLikeThis
[2022-12-19 01:17:54] <ejvald> And soon you will also say something else controversial like: Have fun when playing video games.
[2022-12-19 01:17:59] <Hipokeimenon> BMgamer?
[2022-12-19 01:18:05] <caybellHS> ifl conceding early says alot abt ones persoanluty traits
[2022-12-19 01:18:19] <%Sir_Hugh_Jaynus> this used to be a egg streams Sadge
[2022-12-19 01:18:22] <+Tinyfred> I guess it's really dark and maybe we dont wanna go there, but suicide is ''conceding''
[2022-12-19 01:18:35] <Agyambagyam> let's say you have a 10% chance to win the game if you stay, but 90% of the time you have to watch you slowly getting destroyed and it feels boring and just draining. Is conceding still a bad thing? I don't think so, it's just not a champion's mindset, differing values. that's it, there is nothing to be triggered about
[2022-12-19 01:19:16] <Agyambagyam> Yes, absolutely, agree
[2022-12-19 01:19:18] <joouiie> people just dont play priest, and dont know that you can turn it around, iworth it trying to find a way
[2022-12-19 01:19:41] <JayPwn> from my experience those 3 dread imps should have turned into a golden dread imp NotLikeThis
[2022-12-19 01:19:58] <JayPwn> 4Head
[2022-12-19 01:19:58] <+Tinyfred> Hope is the real outlier here. If you have any sort of hope that there could be a win or positive outcome, you wont surrender
[2022-12-19 01:20:15] <SadLH> what if it is? BibleThump
[2022-12-19 01:20:17] <Eriadar> I think its also important to be realistic tho @NoHandsGamer
[2022-12-19 01:20:22] <+ucdchris1> i concede when the client starts updating and i dont want to wait 2 minutes Kappa
[2022-12-19 01:20:31] <khuchten> AYAYA
[2022-12-19 01:20:31] <+Tinyfred> People surrender when they don't think they have any way out
[2022-12-19 01:20:31] <Rabid_Lorax> DBZ BatChest
[2022-12-19 01:21:16] <+freebeere> every time I shave, it's like hitting the concede button on a beard, thoughts?
[2022-12-19 01:21:23] <i_is_for_inchiladas> so satisfying to see Cell get the absolute fuck kicked out of him by a little boy
[2022-12-19 01:22:24] <joouiie> you are mixing twoo different thigns: games, which ahvea definitive end and like, and trying to have n acting career, which has no definitive end in sight
[2022-12-19 01:22:30] <JayPwn> are there any possible fatigue decks in current meta?
[2022-12-19 01:22:46] <JayPwn> maybe like diamond/plat level
[2022-12-19 01:22:51] <+jengapiece> how do you take care of your beard?
[2022-12-19 01:22:51] <Agyambagyam> If you don't surrender because you have a passion for the thing itself so much that finding out a possible win is itself a thing that is not draining, then totally, yeah, hang in there, totally, I'm just saying different people have different feelings towards the same thing, eg a hearthstone match
[2022-12-19 01:22:52] <+Tinyfred> @JayPwn Only Warlock maybe
[2022-12-19 01:23:15] <joouiie> it's wise to know when to try for something that isnt gonna happen, for gaming you just play it through to the end
[2022-12-19 01:23:34] <KING_TDoT42> Do the ladies like the beard?
[2022-12-19 01:23:53] <authorJeMac> By ladies, he means his mom and her friends
[2022-12-19 01:24:00] <%Sir_Hugh_Jaynus> it's true
[2022-12-19 01:24:05] <Epica_HS> yep :-)
[2022-12-19 01:24:06] <+Tinyfred> My GF hates a beard when I go down
[2022-12-19 01:24:18] <Inn0x> Clean cut
[2022-12-19 01:24:18] <Agyambagyam> can't confirm, my mom hates beards. mostly because they sting in... private activities
[2022-12-19 01:24:18] <Hipokeimenon> when u play a tournament, do u get to know the matchups ull get?? I mean the order?
[2022-12-19 01:24:19] <+Shadowmental> oh i know trust me
[2022-12-19 01:24:21] <+trashjon> Beard softener helps
[2022-12-19 01:25:08] <Eriadar> @joouiie I think ppl should be realistic in gaming too... for example when you are playing aggro druid and some control player clears your board, you have 1 card in hand, they have 7 and you dont concede its not some "champion mentality", its just dumb imo :)
[2022-12-19 01:25:16] <authorJeMac> Payback for girls and their razor pubes. amiright?!

[2022-12-19 01:52:18] <tromic> @LibertarianLawyer make your opponent fall asleep
[2022-12-19 01:52:23] <+datfrogger> @LibertarianLawyer torture ur opponent to death by running them out of all their threats
[2022-12-19 01:52:24] <Deceptolon> the goal is to not die before the enemy does

[2022-12-19 01:54:42] <%+The_monster_hunter> @Agyambagyam to be fair thats because the stores start putting stuff out in october these days

[2022-12-19 01:55:07] <%+Rennman8> Why is he still playing I normally concede this matchup as bless priest
[2022-12-19 01:55:24] <OurYoungHero> Some people like to play Hearthstone.
[2022-12-19 01:55:43] <+chrismeng> What percentage of wins with this deck do you think are concedes from your opponent realizing they can't win instead of you actually having lethal
[2022-12-19 01:55:51] <Agyambagyam> @The_monster_hunter I guess it's to prevent shortage in early december, but it's just so weird to me that christmas is this thing we have to prepare for 1/6th a year in advance otherwise the world flips on it's head
[2022-12-19 01:55:54] <%+Rennman8> @ouryounghero yea thats why you go to the next winnable game
[2022-12-19 01:56:06] <OurYoungHero> @Rennman8 Sounds like you like to win, not play
[2022-12-19 01:56:17] <OurYoungHero> Nothing wrong with that, but some people just playing regardless of outcome.
[2022-12-19 01:56:22] <+ucdchris1> it is inevitable mr anderson

[2022-12-19 01:57:25] <%+Rennman8> @ouryounghero I also see it as unplayable when I know I cant win
[2022-12-19 01:57:34] <%+The_monster_hunter> Same, I don't want to pay for a VPN to get around it too
[2022-12-19 01:57:37] <Meeseeks_> it was never there, that was just a glitch in the matrix
[2022-12-19 01:57:52] <OurYoungHero> @Rennman8 Right. Different idea of what's fun. Some people just like playing the game regardless of outcome.
[2022-12-19 01:57:57] <%+shanevapid> The 4th Matrix movie was kinda unnecessary
[2022-12-19 01:58:15] <+ucdchris1> eswaffs gameplan is to drown as many minion as possible
[2022-12-19 01:58:16] <Agyambagyam> @shanevapid what 4th matrix movie? I heard it got cancelled Kappa
[2022-12-19 01:58:20] <%+The_monster_hunter> Theres just no reason for it to exist LUL
[2022-12-19 01:58:30] <%+shanevapid> It was not very good

[2022-12-19 01:58:42] <Agyambagyam> @NoHandsGamer You haven't seen the 4th matrix? well, you're probably better off lol
[2022-12-19 01:58:45] <badmannerkorea> Matrix 4 was unbelievably bad. I wanted to walk out of the theater
[2022-12-19 01:59:15] <%+shanevapid> You saw it in a theater? I just watched it for free on HBO Max and felt ripped off
[2022-12-19 01:59:18] <%+Mr_M0jo> Matrix 4: The Moneygrab
[2022-12-19 01:59:29] <100kCJ> How does 1 walk out of a theatre streaming it at home on hbo max?
[2022-12-19 01:59:33] <+ucdchris1> it cant be a moneygrab if it loses money
[2022-12-19 01:59:37] <%+The_monster_hunter> The only time I've ever considered walking out was Star wars 9
[2022-12-19 01:59:46] <Agyambagyam> I never understood walking out of the theater.
[2022-12-19 01:59:50] <OurYoungHero> I walk out of every movie eventually.

[2022-12-19 02:09:40] <Jimmy_Page_> how worried are you about the "massive changes" coming to hs in the coming weeks?
[2022-12-19 02:09:45] <Rabid_Lorax> the youtube deal was probably not the right move just from a pure marketing perspective
[2022-12-19 02:09:45] <Agyambagyam> I never once met a person who was loyal to a game because it had a competitive scene, I've met plenty who did because they loved it
[2022-12-19 02:09:51] <lunaloveee8> thats like less than a disguised toast stream
[2022-12-19 02:09:55] <dendaihs> it seemed a lot more fun overall during seatstory times.
[2022-12-19 02:09:56] <100kCJ> Blizz prob dealing w a lot internally. Not focused on certain things with their products they should or could be doing
[2022-12-19 02:10:04] <%+The_monster_hunter> I mean the worst the games popularity has been in years was mid-late 2020 its a fair bit better now then at that point
[2022-12-19 02:10:06] <%+Rennman8> 10k still pretty good for youtube more than gm
[2022-12-19 02:10:19] <EranRefael> idk why any1 play shaman on high ranks. the HSReplay says it's the best winrate..
[2022-12-19 02:10:21] <lunaloveee8> i mean 10k for worlds finals when it used to be 100k+
[2022-12-19 02:10:23] <lunaloveee8> is kinda saf
[2022-12-19 02:10:24] <lunaloveee8> sad*
[2022-12-19 02:10:26] <Jimmy_Page_> the final was also going on during the world cup lol
[2022-12-19 02:10:28] <%+Moophisto> @Agyambagyam I'm only drawn to card games with a competitive scene. And look at the flack Hasbro-WotC gets about the direction its taken MTG
[2022-12-19 02:10:58] <Fawzi412> hearthstone used to be really hyped. now it's a smaller community
[2022-12-19 02:10:59] <%+Rennman8> 100k on twitch with live event
[2022-12-19 02:11:03] <%+shanevapid> Do your parents like visiting Chicago?
[2022-12-19 02:11:06] <Rabid_Lorax> its not like prize money went up after the move to youtube either
[2022-12-19 02:11:07] <+dineria> There was a world Finals.
[2022-12-19 02:11:10] <hylianhero85> Hey, but how's the sex cult? Any new members?
[2022-12-19 02:11:22] <AiqueN> last midas ill give you my heart!!! priest song
[2022-12-19 02:11:25] <AiqueN> LUL
[2022-12-19 02:11:33] <Jimmy_Page_> nohands as a dirty plague priest main did u jerk it to the bunny deaddraw finale
[2022-12-19 02:11:37] <%+Rennman8> The fact that it was online post covid is also pretty sad
[2022-12-19 02:11:37] <+HELIEZ> Yeah World Final was only on Youtube, for some reason.
[2022-12-19 02:11:45] <patrikk808> competitive hearthstone is kind of like competitive chess - no money in it and its very expansive. but people actually want to play competitive chess LULW
[2022-12-19 02:11:46] <+bigoogwe> shame i missed out on the meeting last night
[2022-12-19 02:12:01] <%+The_monster_hunter> Why did they move it to youtube anyway?
[2022-12-19 02:12:05] <+dineria> Even didnt Knowledge there was Finals…..
[2022-12-19 02:12:13] <Agyambagyam> @Agyambagyam I wasn't talking about card games specifically, but I see your point. Card games are inherently competitive, if there is no competition the game is probably dead, makes sense. But the question is, does the attraction stem from the competitiveness, or is it more abstract, like just not wanting to play a dead game?
[2022-12-19 02:12:21] <%darkbeeeeeee> DansGame uncle Nohands, please shave your beard
[2022-12-19 02:12:31] <khoraex> i always miss hearthstoen tournaments because i cannot get myself to turn on notifications for the youtube hearthstone since i am also spammed with tons of irrelevant videos then instead of ONLY the interesting live tournament reminders so even if i turned it on i would just get used to ignoring the noticifcation KEKW
[2022-12-19 02:12:40] <Rabid_Lorax> @The_monster_hunter youtube paid them for the rights to several blizzard competitive leagues
[2022-12-19 02:12:41] <Jimmy_Page_> i like it
[2022-12-19 02:12:49] <Jimmy_Page_> grizzly nohands best nohands
[2022-12-19 02:12:51] <Fawzi412> most of us like it
[2022-12-19 02:13:01] <Fawzi412> looks nice on you
[2022-12-19 02:13:04] <+r2d2isdead> They change meta fast af confirmed.
[2022-12-19 02:13:11] <lunaloveee8> it requires an insane amount of time to do that
[2022-12-19 02:13:17] <lunaloveee8> you need to be trying out things non stop
[2022-12-19 02:13:21] <lunaloveee8> ive prepped with dd and bunny before
[2022-12-19 02:13:24] <lunaloveee8> its just so much work
[2022-12-19 02:13:25] <%+Rennman8> The beard makes me believe the sex cult is true
[2022-12-19 02:13:28] <Jimmy_Page_> the only ones saying they dont like your beard are the ones who cant grow one for themselves.
[2022-12-19 02:13:36] <EranRefael> chess player
[2022-12-19 02:13:43] <%+shanevapid> The reason for the move to YouTube involved a deal where Google agreed to host a considerable portion of Blizzard’s infrastructure on Google Cloud Compute. In return Google got exclusive rights to stream Overwatch League and they threw in HS as well
[2022-12-19 02:13:54] <Agyambagyam> Carlsen is just a different person tbh
[2022-12-19 02:14:01] <+ucdchris1> magnus has been really good at both speed, blitz chess and regular chess tourneys
[2022-12-19 02:14:01] <Agyambagyam> that guy is an anomaly on every front
[2022-12-19 02:14:06] <EranRefael> messi getting older tho. even if he's good
[2022-12-19 02:14:09] <100kCJ> Chess got cool again too, that always helps
[2022-12-19 02:14:11] <+ucdchris1> hes been really good in all the chess formats
[2022-12-19 02:14:14] <Deceptolon> Magnus is a salty loser
[2022-12-19 02:14:17] <AiqueN> hikaru
[2022-12-19 02:14:18] <EranRefael> he can't run as he used to
[2022-12-19 02:14:22] <+dnasquared> Fischer Random Chess kinda does that?
[2022-12-19 02:14:28] <patrikk808> carlsen does not care about the meta LUL
[2022-12-19 02:14:33] <Rabid_Lorax> you have to keep training CONSTANTLY at the highest level of chess and the meta constantly evolves, as well as constantly doing dozens of hours of prep for every tournament
[2022-12-19 02:14:54] <Agyambagyam> carlsen just plays 1.G4 and mops the floor with you
[2022-12-19 02:14:56] <%+Rennman8> Chess definitely needs a patch its too stagnant
[2022-12-19 02:15:09] <Hyoob> changing the meta often exists in chess, it's chess 960 or fisher random
[2022-12-19 02:15:14] <%+Rennman8> Stale*
[2022-12-19 02:15:29] <patrikk808> also there is no meta under fide master level. imagine competitive hearthstone but you can play homemade decks and be fine
[2022-12-19 02:15:30] <100kCJ> If chess gets a nerf, its checkers
[2022-12-19 02:15:39] <EranRefael> if you can't heal for 80 LUL
[2022-12-19 02:15:59] <Deceptolon> chess needs a 3rd dimension like in star trek
[2022-12-19 02:16:03] <%+Rennman8> Queen is too powerful needs a nerf
[2022-12-19 02:16:05] <Agyambagyam> isn't chess 960 about the meta changing though? just raw skill no knowledge? I think the top players are still kind of ordered the same way there in therms of skill as the actual game
[2022-12-19 02:16:05] <Rabid_Lorax> chess is about knowing hundreds of thousands of opening lines and being very mentaly sharp
[2022-12-19 02:16:43] <%+shanevapid> You can disrupt the dh so much and still die. I watched Meati make a dh discard their relic of dimensions then ate their jace and he still lost LUL
[2022-12-19 02:17:00] <chalsd> damn dont ever dare critizing chess or all the 200iq fans get rabid
[2022-12-19 02:17:02] <100kCJ> If only we could go hustle kids in central park playing hearthstone
[2022-12-19 02:17:03] <Jimmy_Page_> you gotta give bunny big respect for shutting down his stream for the last month just to focus on worlds. he couldve been grinding viewership/ads/subs instead he risked it and used his time to focus on hs
[2022-12-19 02:17:26] <EranRefael> emphasise on "your deck"
[2022-12-19 02:17:32] <EranRefael> HungryPaimon
[2022-12-19 02:17:46] <roboticowl> Are you still playing tournaments? Or more focused on the stream?
[2022-12-19 02:17:55] <Jimmy_Page_> granted you stream to 20x of his audience so it would be a larger loss of income for you
[2022-12-19 02:18:11] <Hipokeimenon> how does the invitation system work for tournaments?
[2022-12-19 02:18:15] <%+Rennman8> At least there is no Hearthstone computer that bests every human
[2022-12-19 02:18:37] <%+shanevapid> Bunny is an OG. I literally can’t remember a time when he wasn’t playing HS at a high level. I’ve been playing and watching HS on Twitch since the very very beginning
[2022-12-19 02:18:53] <Jimmy_Page_> wait i didnt see you at the lich kign invitational
[2022-12-19 02:18:56] <+ash_l3yyyy> @Rennman8 wym i always lose to the Armor and Rope warriors on wild ladder KappaClaus
[2022-12-19 02:20:04] <tromic> runes are such a failure. the optimal way to build DK is to try to circumvent the system with a ton of discovers
[2022-12-19 02:20:14] <EranRefael> at the end the better Sire Denathrius player won
[2022-12-19 02:20:30] <%+shanevapid> The dk’s cards, individually, are pretty powerful. Just feels like it has no direction.
[2022-12-19 02:20:42] <%rotemv3> @tromic thats not a failure
[2022-12-19 02:20:48] <+datfrogger> @shanevapid feel like bunny wasnt there from the very very beginning. i started at beginning and i dont remember him at the start
[2022-12-19 02:21:00] <!TheoHS_> patchwerk is pretty good YEP just doesnt fit in the other 2 archetypes
[2022-12-19 02:21:06] <Jimmy_Page_> its gonna suck for future DK cards bc people that main a specific rune will only get very few new choices bc they have to be split 3 ways
[2022-12-19 02:21:09] <akmalny2022> Why did Silvername stop playing Lader, did he realize that he was weak at it?
[2022-12-19 02:21:20] <EranRefael> only in wild. with neutral.
[2022-12-19 02:21:43] <TheMrDudeManSir> Im curious. If DK didn't have rune limitations would it be OP?
[2022-12-19 02:21:44] <Agyambagyam> how will they balance the 3 runes with limited cards to print each expansion? that seems weird, it appears to me 2 classes will always be dead
[2022-12-19 02:21:49] <sekkaTFT> are there any new interesting lists

[2022-12-19 02:23:43] <+spacewind> whos ccheating
[2022-12-19 02:23:45] <+ucdchris1> silvername
[2022-12-19 02:23:45] <thedesstroier> It’s a bad look for the community to not care at all with their viewership too
[2022-12-19 02:23:53] <Deceptolon> Cheating how exactly?
[2022-12-19 02:24:01] <Agyambagyam> where I live, be altrustic towards those who you care about, otherwise be a piece of shit YEP
[2022-12-19 02:24:24] <+ucdchris1> silvername was part of a group that targetted harassment at other battleground streamers
[2022-12-19 02:24:27] <%+PineappleTrainWreck> santa baby? i thought this song was concelled for sa? LOL
[2022-12-19 02:24:35] <100kCJ> Streamers can prove they get sniped, but blizz dont care either
[2022-12-19 02:24:35] <%MeatiHS> Morality isn’t really rewarded at all, extremes of morality get punished that’s about it
[2022-12-19 02:24:36] <+r2d2isdead> Like just getting plays from other people?
[2022-12-19 02:24:37] <+ucdchris1> he got banned from lobby legends because of that sort of involve ment
[2022-12-19 02:24:47] <Deceptolon> Santa baby, imagine a toddler with a beard and red hat
[2022-12-19 02:24:48] <%+shanevapid> Being a good person isn’t a good strategy for getting ahead in life, I feel
[2022-12-19 02:25:07] <+r2d2isdead> Or told opponents cards?
[2022-12-19 02:25:11] <Rabid_Lorax> the best strategy is presenting yourself as a good person while turning a blind eye to any bad thing that benefits you
[2022-12-19 02:25:31] <torryfloyd> When did POS get you anywhere in life
[2022-12-19 02:25:53] <Agyambagyam> depends on what your goal is, different startegies are needed for different goals
[2022-12-19 02:26:04] <+kwijiboe> @nohandsgamer if you aren’t cheating you aren’t trying is the term you’re looking for some cultures
[2022-12-19 02:26:12] <Kwe_SBB> @r2d2isdead rigging BGs games to win them to qualify for bug tourney and to get other players to not qualify. Win trading basically
[2022-12-19 02:26:24] <Agyambagyam> I know doctors who would sacrifice everything just to help more people.... and we all know people on the other end
[2022-12-19 02:26:54] <100kCJ> In politics, being a good person matters!!! 🤥
[2022-12-19 02:27:12] <+mrmac46> who got caught cheating?

[2022-12-19 02:37:30] <%+shanevapid> It’s gonna be weird when the hero cards rotate. Imagine playing druid with only 10 mana

[2022-12-19 02:53:47] <%+Aalardin> I got super wrecked because I didn’t know the shrub whelps count towards onyxia staying immune
[2022-12-19 02:54:59] <cabstero> so now there are no eggs or pelicans... how tragic
[2022-12-19 02:55:33] <+the_high_groundd> is this a top 5 meta of all time?
[2022-12-19 02:55:50] <ColonelBlabby> the pelicans migrated
[2022-12-19 02:55:53] <!TheoHS_> did you know the minion off the 1 mana pala spell counts as a whelp

[2022-12-19 02:57:06] <%+Aalardin> I’m just gonna assume all dragons are whelps when onyxia is down lol
[2022-12-19 02:57:08] <ColonelBlabby> whats the token called?
[2022-12-19 02:57:34] <%+OverthinkingJohny> These tokens are whelps
