[2022-12-10 08:20:32] <ot_cosmos> get a professional to do it bro, not worth 20k engine unless you know your stuff
[2022-12-10 08:20:33] <+Robberree> it would be better to be taken to a tune shop and have a professional put a tune on it and get it dynod.

[2022-12-10 08:35:32] <owkay__> @sinatraa ecu is fine preset tunes especially if you’re mostly looking at getting rev limiter off and stuff so should be safe, as long as it’s from a reputable company, always can reset tunes before it goes to maintenance and stuff
[2022-12-10 08:35:32] <%ehmRikki> Theres a installation guide but in all comes down to if you want the tuner on it or not
[2022-12-10 08:35:38] <crono0427> hello chat and streamer :) happy to be here
[2022-12-10 08:35:41] <sibbysibb> That seems like just a level one ecu flash. no crazy remapping. more timing added so you will gain hp and efficiency.  When the tune start requiring other mods to work thats when you are getting a bit more serious. this is like a stage one tho in comparison @sinatraa

[2022-12-10 08:36:24] <+wonpopp> a 30% hp gain is good

[2022-12-10 08:36:31] <Arima_nii> @sinatraa they can tell at the dealership if you flashed your ecu it will log all the changes in cache (they will void your warranty instantly) for drivetrain

[2022-12-10 08:36:45] <@^Nightbot> g640. Check it out here: https://grrt.co/Sinatraa-Mousepad
[2022-12-10 08:36:48] <+Jaysmooth513_> So it’s just a pre tuner but if it actually does what It says it does there will be almost no way you’ll be able to tell the difference with out someone that knows what there doing
[2022-12-10 08:36:51] <+CashDashh> just buy another

[2022-12-10 08:36:55] <+Jaysmooth513_> 20k?
[2022-12-10 08:36:57] <horizonnnnn_> too rich to care

[2022-12-10 08:37:02] <+ManInACar> @sinatraa you can have a map that you can turn on and off this way warranty isnt voided
[2022-12-10 08:37:03] <+example_il> surely too rich for a warranty
[2022-12-10 08:37:07] <sibbysibb> it depends on what software the dealer uses. if its a reputable tuner, the tune isnt what will break the engine. so the warranty will still cover it if they cant prove that the tune caused the issue @sinatraa
[2022-12-10 08:37:09] <%basura223> poor moment Id just buy a new one
[2022-12-10 08:37:17] <Arima_nii> @sinatraa it takes a while to source a motor from Porsche without the warranty
