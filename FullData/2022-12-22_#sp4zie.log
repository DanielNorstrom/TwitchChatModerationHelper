[2022-12-22 16:17:08] <!%$dyson1> visual bug clearly
[2022-12-22 16:17:09] <zanaror> yep, its bugged
[2022-12-22 16:17:25] <!Hypersugar> might not be a bug if she timed her ult
[2022-12-22 16:17:33] <@%DevilHunterJax> Watching the clip, you don't see the tentacle actually appear. You see the spawn animation, then the tentacles just slams out of nowhere.
[2022-12-22 16:17:33] <!Hypersugar> then the first slap goes so fast you don't see it
[2022-12-22 16:17:44] <+IAmNotAfk> @Hypersugar it happened twice
[2022-12-22 16:17:47] <Kruiz01> there was a huge tentacle on the tower, just blind xd

[2022-12-22 16:18:29] <+MadHattersteaparty> yeah there's an indicator usually

[2022-12-22 16:18:40] <+espherix> lol
[2022-12-22 16:18:40] <$J3Iy> Prob bugged, where the tentacle slams right as it spawns, so there is no indicator
[2022-12-22 16:18:46] <halcoo> no no you are crazy, just not about the tentacle thing
[2022-12-22 16:18:48] <%Marknow2> When you ult it slaps faster, and also a couple of patches ago they fixed so that spawning tentacles slaps at once at spawn, when you use W.
[2022-12-22 16:18:50] <@%MacYodaNL> @DjokeeN its fine we cried last monday and last thursday and the monday before that already
[2022-12-22 16:18:54] <+TheScrubLord135> They might have changed it because it became pretty useless with how slow and obvious it was before

[2022-12-22 16:22:19] <Kruiz01> it's on the back of the tower spuz, look better xd
[2022-12-22 16:22:21] <!Hypersugar> if she used ult
[2022-12-22 16:22:23] <@%MacYodaNL> THERE ON THE TOWER
[2022-12-22 16:22:24] <!Hypersugar> then its normal
[2022-12-22 16:22:26] <%Marknow2> Not a bug. It just slaps fast now when it spawns.
[2022-12-22 16:22:32] <!Hypersugar> if she didnt ult
[2022-12-22 16:22:34] <!Hypersugar> its a bug

[2022-12-22 16:22:43] <@%MacYodaNL> Its behind your cam
[2022-12-22 16:22:46] <+IAmNotAfk> @Hypersugar watch the whole clip. it happens twice
[2022-12-22 16:22:55] <@%DevilHunterJax> It's there, it just slams faster than usual...
[2022-12-22 16:22:59] <!Hypersugar> yeah but if she's in ult duration it's normal
[2022-12-22 16:23:00] <zuag1777> When she ults her tentacles goes invincible and fast without indicators. The only thing you Can look for is the little spawn thing
[2022-12-22 16:23:01] <Kruiz01> she ulted xd

[2022-12-22 16:23:04] <zanaror> bug or not, its a stupid design
[2022-12-22 16:23:04] <ETBangry> You can see the tentacle I think spazie is talking about the hit indicator
[2022-12-22 16:23:05] <DjokeeN> The whole process looked buggy xD
[2022-12-22 16:23:05] <!Hypersugar> doesnt matter once or twice
[2022-12-22 16:23:08] <$tjrayne> he sees the tentacle guys. there was no indication of it slamming
[2022-12-22 16:23:09] <!%$dyson1> @Hypersugar it's one that spawns from E though, those should always give the indicator on the ground
[2022-12-22 16:23:10] <!Hypersugar> it lasts 10s or something
[2022-12-22 16:23:14] <$J3Iy> I think we get that the tentacle is there, it's the indicator that's missing xD
[2022-12-22 16:23:14] <@%DevilHunterJax> Like, normally it spawns and you get about 0.5 seconds before it slams so you can avoid it
[2022-12-22 16:23:16] <Kruiz01> @DjokeeN no it didn't
[2022-12-22 16:23:23] <%+will_paterson> Anyone want to partner up and tag each other for the giveaway? sp4zieDerp
[2022-12-22 16:23:27] <!Hypersugar> @dyson1 no, if she ults they go away
[2022-12-22 16:23:36] <DjokeeN> @DjokeeN He died before the tentacle landed, no
[2022-12-22 16:23:36] <!%$dyson1> sp4zieHmmm
[2022-12-22 16:23:37] <!Hypersugar> doesnt matter where they spawned from
[2022-12-22 16:23:38] <DjokeeN> ?
[2022-12-22 16:23:39] <+IAmNotAfk> @Hypersugar but the secone slap was so fast. the second slap should be slower

[2022-12-22 16:24:21] <Lothlorii> @Sp4zie The indicator is a small stream of watery stuff going from you to the spawn location to indicate where it spawns, then it slaps immediately. Apparently nearly invisible with that specific skin

[2022-12-22 16:24:29] <!%$dyson1> maybe she ulted just as it spawned and that made it slam down immediately
