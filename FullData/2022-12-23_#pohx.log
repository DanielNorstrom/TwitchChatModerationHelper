[2022-12-23 16:14:01] <%kjlhs> 20
[2022-12-23 16:14:05] <%dwe0p> it is weaker than ryslathas on bs jug i feel just cause u dont go 2 defensive auras u just go determ but on slayer i can see that being very useful might have to try that out
[2022-12-23 16:14:11] <dancegodmirorb> what is a RMR jewel?
[2022-12-23 16:14:14] <Kecho579> Hey Pohx.  First off thanks for the FAQ very helpful.  I was looking through there and didn't see a question of why your RF Color is different then normal RF.  Are you running something different to change that color?  Thanks
[2022-12-23 16:14:21] <Nosuri1> oh nvm, I thought it was 40
[2022-12-23 16:14:23] <+MadLeds> they should enable stack-trading for Div cards

[2022-12-23 16:15:34] <+Eluvex> Hey @Pohx, do you do gear checks to tell me where to improve my char?
[2022-12-23 16:15:35] <+MadLeds> the default RF effect makes it so hard to see stuff
[2022-12-23 16:15:44] <+MrSlimyTaco> i like the same one but jsut cuz it easier to see stuff compared to everything else tbh
[2022-12-23 16:15:51] <Nosuri1> @MrSlimyTaco I did get 2 Divine drops AFTER I bought the new RF MTX, so im not saying it is buuut.. TheIlluminati
[2022-12-23 16:16:02] <+Eluvex> Thanks
[2022-12-23 16:16:07] <%dwe0p> perseverance actually is very viable for that purpose ty i will look into that mb make my own build hell yeah

[2022-12-23 18:42:11] <%vianadota> I just traded a 140 fire damage sceptre for a 158 burning damage sceptre and i lost damage, is it because fire damage only stacks with fire damage and burning damage only stacks with burning damage ? or could it be another variable like fire damage over time for example?
[2022-12-23 18:42:53] <+Arakismo> Here is mine if you have time to do it :) : https://pastebin.com/7w8ZRNHJ
[2022-12-23 18:42:57] <@%lemoncoolers> @vianadota you need to balance increases and multi both. Without a lot of one, the other is not as effective.

[2022-12-23 19:26:38] <%+Rybsson> yup, i know, that's fair but in the interest of clarity, it's better to use different screenshot

Got the unique belt, boots and the spell block shield and startet mapping today. Should I prioritize Tempest shield over other auras or should it always be the last choice? Currently waiting for socket colors to match so I can finally go malevolence or skitterbots.

[2022-12-23 20:01:25] <+SooperWooper194> I feel that, cilantro can be way over powering
[2022-12-23 20:01:26] <Dremmestar> I have that soap with

[2022-12-23 20:51:06] <Strollein> @GoGoLoThirty meh, expedition in maps like crimson temple sucks imo, because it can spawn on a cross section which usually means you wont get all the skulls
[2022-12-23 20:51:13] <%convay121> oh neat
[2022-12-23 20:51:24] <%naadirius> @gimme yw

[2022-12-23 20:51:30] <@%GoGoLoThirty> @Strollein if you have the nodes, you can get all of them. the range and radius on explosives is super overkill
[2022-12-23 20:51:55] <Strollein> I guess but I feel like those maps spawn less skulls in general too
[2022-12-23 20:52:00] <@%GoGoLoThirty> but yeah i guess super mazelike maps arent quite as good
[2022-12-23 20:52:11] <xArclightx> Speaking of expedition. Beside the signs (if they arent counters to RF), what should I definitely get exploded? All skulls or focus sth else?
