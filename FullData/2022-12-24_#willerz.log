[2022-12-24 03:04:26] <%+Fireballmx> my wildcard bet is we see lightkeeper or get a lightkeeper event for end of prewipe
[2022-12-24 03:04:29] <%mt_l4d2> most of these prewipes were really cool imo
[2022-12-24 03:04:31] <johngjohn> being max strength now is great.

[2022-12-24 19:51:11] <%druwpa> according to the wiki its 4 per raid at 400 raids
[2022-12-24 19:51:22] <Littlewedge> i dont no if thats legit its just what i heard
[2022-12-24 19:51:24] <+SpencerPlaysGG> @SpencerPlaysGG Thanks! Happy Holidays :)
[2022-12-24 19:51:27] <Abel_Jo> you can divide that by two since you black both legs at once most of the time
[2022-12-24 19:51:27] <SirOnyxTDK> yeah... I kinda am down next wipe...
[2022-12-24 19:51:33] <%druwpa> sorry 1400 raids not 400
[2022-12-24 19:51:35] <%TitansHeros> now that he pet baby glu hes gona have "hair on his mouse pad" lol

[2022-12-24 19:52:07] <captainredbeard94> damn thats a cute pup
[2022-12-24 19:52:10] <MrJargon> sure is tempting to just jump off at the end of each raid if i havent already surged
[2022-12-24 19:52:11] <@%$LBoogs_> I know things about you
[2022-12-24 19:52:12] <SimSimExtrem> you guys can brake more than 4 per raid lol just brake multiple times
[2022-12-24 19:52:13] <%WazzuHahn> Rather have max surgery or max search to start the new wipe.
[2022-12-24 19:52:18] <SirOnyxTDK> tried for kappa this wipe but never got a marked key after like 1k runs. so might just do some fun max skill stuff next wipe instead lol

[2022-12-24 19:52:20] <Abel_Jo> dude thats only 700 jumps??
[2022-12-24 19:52:20] <%bootyraider420> he said 400 raids with 4 surgeries per raid
[2022-12-24 19:52:28] <%edisomxl> at least like two three hours of straight cmsing I would say if not more
[2022-12-24 19:52:30] <%druwpa> @bootyraider420 1400 i was wrong

[2022-12-24 20:58:20] <+KevboLocoT2K> use your card then pay it off every month paying interest is not good
[2022-12-24 20:58:29] <HeylmAIone> imagine being on your parents credit card wow what an achievement

[2022-12-24 21:01:32] <%TSvassilev> you only rub it in their face if they like it. in which case they usually rub it in their faces themselves
[2022-12-24 21:01:34] <%gcheezyy> point is take what you got and make the best of it, dont focus on other people and grind

[2022-12-24 21:42:00] <bill_lumbergh1> Since they changed it to 15 i never had flea anymore  ha
[2022-12-24 21:42:06] <BmoXCV> I personally wouldn't mind if flea wasn't open til 20 again. But would probably be easier on newer players if it was 10 or stayed at 15

[2022-12-24 21:43:01] <bill_lumbergh1> 15 still too high for casual players like me. You still have to play quite a bit to get to 15 if your not an expert in tarkov
