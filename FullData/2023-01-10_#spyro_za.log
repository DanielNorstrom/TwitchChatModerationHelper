[2023-01-10 10:48:28] <thenoirman> because you have the high tempo destroy package for your early rounds, a leech isnt sacrificing too much
[2023-01-10 10:48:41] <inther4> you play jubilee
[2023-01-10 10:48:43] <tobimk4> Ive tried that as well entering pool 3 but it's just really slow cuz you dont get ahead enough to afford 3 power turn 5 play
[2023-01-10 10:48:53] <inther4> i mean you can try jubilee
[2023-01-10 10:49:23] <Crayonfart_> we need early tempo tho

[2023-01-10 12:44:57] <%+Mamouthpower> you can roll different effect each time you  max
[2023-01-10 12:44:58] <LauMei27> @quantoll it's true tho, in other games 100$ guarantees you a bunch of cards, in snap you get like 2 on average
[2023-01-10 12:44:59] <Mr0ldBoy> it allows you to constant upgrafde it - gain collection levels
[2023-01-10 12:45:08] <Hekmekk> yes and the rarrest are inkified which is black and white or a golden background  @Spyro_ZA

[2023-01-10 14:17:16] <Ezras> apparently a lot of people think the devs are calling us idiots because we are supposed to be ok with halted progress of getting the better cards as long as we see bigger token bundles from reserves

[2023-01-10 14:19:58] <Ezras> on average for a unfinished pool 3 player it would take them 3-4 months to get a single series 4 or 5 card
[2023-01-10 14:20:04] <Ezras> from the shop
[2023-01-10 14:20:45] <Ezras> that means you and me

[2023-01-10 14:23:27] <Ezras> @iwilljoy apparently it was worse because the paywall behind it as well

[2023-01-10 14:24:44] <+drunkbonjovi> now probably like 90 percent of hearthstone players play battlegrounds
[2023-01-10 14:25:01] <Ezras> @drunkbonjovi here is the eye opener alot of players don't know the average CL to finish pool 3 is around 3600
[2023-01-10 14:25:33] <+drunkbonjovi> yeah I'm just starting pool 3 from what you said, but I only play daily missions and that's all
[2023-01-10 14:25:39] <%+cyper94> @simply untrue, the average is just below 3000

[2023-01-10 14:26:43] <%+cyper94> @ezras sure but that's good, since you will take pool 4 cards, right now tho is below 3000
[2023-01-10 14:26:44] <Darsade> if only it was the only problem of gwont
[2023-01-10 14:26:47] <+drunkbonjovi> you could spam arena in hearthstone and if you were good at it you had pretty much free cards
[2023-01-10 14:26:57] <SharpRL> what would u recommend for pool 2? @Spyro_ZA
[2023-01-10 14:26:57] <%JohnnyL0513> In some way the devs being predatory also helps the game sustain financially
