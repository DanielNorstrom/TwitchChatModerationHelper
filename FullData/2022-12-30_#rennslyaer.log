[2022-12-30 06:12:08] <!%$mister_mingo> If you like defunctland, there's a series called Nick Knacks that's similar in style, all about the history of Nickelodeon TV shows. Each episode is a history of a show as it aired chronologically, so it starts in the 1970s. He just got to the 1990s shows after a few years of doing the show.
[2022-12-30 06:12:38] <%Libiteena> It has one of the best rollercoasters out there, Phantom's Revenge.

[2022-12-30 06:40:21] <%Libiteena> Cheer100 To be fair to Kennywood, the Old mills capacity is abysmal due to its old design. The average ride can handle 800 to 900 people per hour. The old mill can only handle 150 people per hour. That would be 10 hours on grand opening day roughly.

[2022-12-30 08:13:55] <%Libiteena> Cheer100 Last thing, I also rode a pretty... infamous ride. It was a ride called Hellevator. It was the first, prototype drop tower ride, and it was at Six Flags Kentucky Kingdom back in 2006. The ride might not sound familiar, until you hear it was renamed to Superman: Tower of Power in 2007. A certain incident involving cables and a foot later occured that year. It was due to Six Flags buying cheaper, thinner cables than the manufacturer recommended to cut on maintenance... on a prototype.
