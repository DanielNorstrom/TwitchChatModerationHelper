[2022-12-21 16:58:54] <%hannibalfront> The problem is that whenever a cheap deck is Tier 1, they nerf it immediately because everyone is playing the cheap deck

[2022-12-21 17:22:29] <thefrisbeeguy> @FenoHS did you try the tavern brawl this week (i know) but its actually pretty cool this time around
[2022-12-21 17:22:29] <hskookdoug> @FenoHS  https://imgur.com/a/Qoj7GPK The idea is to get bolner, gorloc ravager, clownfish in your mulligan to draw a bunch of murlocs for free to effectively set up a rotgill play. you can usually get it rolling with the coin on turn 5 or 6 without it. schooling also enables rotgills DR easily. The combo is not the only win condition as murlocs were already effective in the past metas. you can use macaw W/ astalor for burst/ Mutanus for disruption and brukan's hero power to do burst damage

[2022-12-21 20:15:40] <%Eriadar> @aquaculturedd without maestra its not, surely not in early game
[2022-12-21 20:15:51] <aquaculturedd> surely we discover 100 cards from other classes

[2022-12-21 20:16:03] <Minidagger> the only reason people play maestra is to confuse the opponent Kappa

[2022-12-21 20:16:09] <+nesben_> I think potion belt and gnoll are so broken together no sense that interaction, potion belt is the rogue card not the other 3
