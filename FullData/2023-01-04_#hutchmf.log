[2023-01-04 00:43:31] <%$StopDropNRofl> @AyeGavMF I don't expect you to assist every person, because that's impractical and opens the door to endless questions, but my sound is definitely more tinny and hollow than Hutch's. I wanted to know if you could quickly describe the signal flow of Hutch's game sound so I can see how it's being processed.

[2023-01-04 02:14:12] <DarkKraken69> They should make less used keys infinite, and more used keys low use (like labs)
[2023-01-04 02:14:14] <dreddski_> i feel like it gets to a point in the wipe that you only play 2 or 3 aps
[2023-01-04 02:14:17] <+JakeyyyGee> Have you unlocked the gym in the hideout yet? @HutchMF I really wanna see it in action

[2023-01-04 05:27:41] <zebruhfy> @langdollars with new update they tried to fix audio but for some reason new audio gives a huge performance loss so people disable it

[2023-01-04 05:28:06] <%steven_aka_d_howl91> @HutchMF Drop your bag so klean can get that ammo
[2023-01-04 05:28:08] <@%RemState> @Langdollars just ignore that guy, it's basically someone who escaped the short bus.
[2023-01-04 05:28:09] <Fear_Winter> @HutchMF PS12A only has 10 penetration
[2023-01-04 05:28:20] <Langdollars> @zebruhfy thank you.
[2023-01-04 05:28:44] <%+StageName> @RemState at least he escaped Kapp
[2023-01-04 05:28:45] <Langdollars> @RemState I am pretty much on the short bus so i'll take what i can get lol
[2023-01-04 05:28:56] <@%RemState> @StageName i think he fell off

[2023-01-04 05:29:17] <%sky_avila> Bad luck to play on this server, some have actually good fps
[2023-01-04 05:29:39] <The_P1zza_Guy> Why is audio so bad in EFT ? I've never played
[2023-01-04 05:30:18] <@%RemState> @The_P1zza_Guy daredevil is working on the audio
[2023-01-04 05:30:18] <+dewragtv> bc the devs hate us and like to see us fail
[2023-01-04 05:30:20] <+RaizT1> First time watching you play this game. Seems like there is a lot of screen tearing (if you're familiar with the term).
[2023-01-04 05:30:26] <mr__p_nutty> I wonder if they‚Äôll ever add the Barrett 50cal to tarkov

[2023-01-04 05:30:29] <EgoBreak3r> who knows, cause it is
[2023-01-04 05:30:32] <%+mutedmedic> audio was never good, but it used to be playable.
[2023-01-04 05:30:35] <+Dementedx1x> ya, PS12A is a flesh round, has very little pen on armor
[2023-01-04 05:30:37] <+deathnightwc3> multi level maps are the problem, woods and customs are great

[2023-01-04 05:31:35] <%+l3on_lgn> Yeah
[2023-01-04 05:31:55] <%+TheBeardedAssassin> Do Factions matter at all in game? or is it just preference?
[2023-01-04 05:32:00] <+BFGHouse> Eh the issues with the engine are the worst imo, it's why hacking will NEVER be fixed
[2023-01-04 05:32:02] <+ToxicRickD99> i swear you would avg 90-100 fps\

[2023-01-04 22:25:11] <+TheJae_> @HutchMF When do drops start for you?
[2023-01-04 22:25:13] <@%RemState> @ColdarionMF open DTS Sound Unbound, change to default headphones set to balanced. If using IEM change to IEM and set to which ever fits your audio best.
[2023-01-04 22:25:43] <@%RemState> @ColdarionMF then turn on in right clicking speaker icon in bottom right on win10 or on your audio source in sound menu in win 11

[2023-01-04 22:27:42] <@%RemState> if you get errors downloading Open the WINDOWS STORE APP in WINDOWS and get it that way
[2023-01-04 22:27:50] <johnnyguitar99> cancel the download and do it again
[2023-01-04 22:28:00] <+arthiXYZ> IF ITS NOT DOWNLOADING THEN DOWNLOAD DTS UNBOUND
[2023-01-04 22:28:06] <+primevi1> binaural tanks my fps
[2023-01-04 22:28:11] <+arthiXYZ> AND NOT DTS HEADPHONE X
[2023-01-04 22:28:29] <+NeishyK> DTS Headphone:X v1 doesn't work for me but I did get dts unbound, is it the same?
[2023-01-04 22:28:29] <%victimcheech> Hard to believe Microsoft cant handle the downloads
[2023-01-04 22:28:35] <johnnyguitar99> binaural off its still good
[2023-01-04 22:28:44] <@%RemState> @arthiXYZ I use DTS:Headphones:X btw, sennheiser 6xx

[2023-01-04 22:29:12] <%+teeohdeedee> Is it a win10 vs win11 thing?  With win11 I had to download DTS Sound Unbound.
[2023-01-04 22:29:12] <%victimcheech> hopefully the 20 bucks is worth it!!!!!!
[2023-01-04 22:29:19] <@%RemState> @victimcheech more people probably used the microsoft store app yesterday than microsoft store has in existence lol
[2023-01-04 22:29:20] <+Relicke_> the scavs smacking your cheeks is what gets me
[2023-01-04 22:29:23] <May_Be_AFK> @CreatureBruhh it might sound dumb but do you have textures low? you might turn them up.
[2023-01-04 22:29:24] <unstablephlegm> Watching your old videos what happened to your acne you had clear skin a couple years ago @hutchmf
[2023-01-04 22:29:31] <+primevi1> ye usually at 100 fps with it on im on 60 lool
[2023-01-04 22:29:33] <+arthiXYZ> @RemState btw even my interface sound changes when I use the DTS setting, is that normal?
[2023-01-04 22:29:53] <atpickle> and if you never open it again it just stays running forever
[2023-01-04 22:29:56] <ColdarionMF> oh u gotta pay for it?
[2023-01-04 22:29:59] <%victimcheech> @RemState you are probably right, figured the azure network would help!!! lol kekw
[2023-01-04 22:30:00] <@%RemState> @arthiXYZ uhh it's changing the audio profile so yeah it might change a little depending on your headphones

[2023-01-04 22:30:30] <+arthiXYZ> @RemState maybe its cause of voicemeeter, i would have to try without that
