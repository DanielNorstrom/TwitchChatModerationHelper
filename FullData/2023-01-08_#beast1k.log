[2023-01-08 15:31:56] <moayaspace> Wanna start a new char, any good weap to start with and main please guys ? im playing solo
[2023-01-08 15:32:12] <myzone0> @SinisterX55 invis right before the one handed uses e, they have to restack, if you cant then use blink for shoes, if you cant then shadow edge eye frame, if you cant then interrupt the E, if you cant then use cleric robe, if you cant then ice block, if you cant then guardian helm, I will stop here, ether way one handed is dogshit.
[2023-01-08 15:32:18] <drivenblank> it and arcane are some the only ones that feel good to play for some reason for me
[2023-01-08 15:32:37] <romba_2020> why don't stash first
[2023-01-08 15:32:38] <antooniekidd> use 1h curse or regular bow its good

[2023-01-08 15:35:44] <antooniekidd> I use 5 flat warbow with 1080 ip and I can still kill players with 1400ip lol
[2023-01-08 15:36:01] <prismatic_moz> i think oathkeeper are good for mist
[2023-01-08 15:36:04] <RestlnPieces> @myzone0 yea im play it last couple days but its annoying to play against dgivers and demonic i mean almost all curse builds :(

[2023-01-08 15:36:34] <drivenblank> i think dual swords is gunna be played ALOT after the next patch
