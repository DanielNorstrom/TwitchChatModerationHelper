[2022-12-08 21:14:07] <MachetePhD> @DimwittedAnimal From what I've heard of Dwarf Fortress, the level of detail goes as far as to have separate healths and states for things like each character's individual fingernails, the skin, the blood under that skin, etc?
[2022-12-08 21:14:18] <GameDevYal> there used to exist a bug where cats would get alcohol-poisoned if they walked in a spilled drink, because they would erroneously absorb an entire mug into their fur and then drink it when cleaning themselves... THAT's how detailed things are simulated

[2022-12-08 22:31:49] <%bunglinglummox> brewing always returns the seeds, yes

[2022-12-08 22:56:07] <ululator> I felt like work details don't work very well. it works better to build another workshop and assign it to a skilled dwarf if you want a skilled dwarf to work on something
[2022-12-08 22:56:11] <ionlich> or they have 7 out of 10 left
