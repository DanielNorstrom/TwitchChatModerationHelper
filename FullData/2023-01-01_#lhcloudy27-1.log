[2023-01-01 14:55:02] <%doximanman> if im decent but not perfect at rein do you think its better to learn another hero or to one trick rein and try to improve even when im playing like shit? @LhCloudy27

[2023-01-01 14:55:21] <VeeXYZ> @sabre5395 probably. I think what they should have done was NOT add that change. But if they really had too.. maybe have shields decrease the damage by 50%
[2023-01-01 14:56:04] <%doximanman> i mean... hog can work even without being super experienced at playing him, no? LUL

[2023-01-01 14:57:38] <+sabre5395> The falloff change was more than enough IMO
[2023-01-01 14:57:40] <%doximanman> i meant play another hero when it goes bad as rein, not to switch completely
[2023-01-01 14:58:13] <%doximanman> not to main another hero i mean

[2023-01-01 17:39:09] <%geno69> sigma for ppl who likes spam crap
[2023-01-01 17:39:14] <papajis> Junkertown sigma is better on first section
[2023-01-01 17:39:18] <%geno69> ofc
[2023-01-01 17:39:20] <%+TheTurtleHax> lol
[2023-01-01 17:39:22] <+kelebraska> sigma when you suck at the game, the dmg stat make you feel like a good player
[2023-01-01 17:39:23] <luazri> LUL
[2023-01-01 17:39:26] <CHICKEN2XD> All sigma is fun for is lifting opponents from point
[2023-01-01 17:39:26] <$marodas2> Winton and Ram?
[2023-01-01 17:39:27] <TheeABCs> rein can spam the chat
[2023-01-01 17:39:29] <%geno69> im totally into rein religion cloudy , you know it xd
[2023-01-01 17:39:30] <despite_ow> so if youre getting rolled by flankers you shouldnt go sigma?
[2023-01-01 17:39:31] <Retaliator3> Sigma has bare feet
[2023-01-01 17:39:32] <%+Shromeshak> Sigma on dorado
[2023-01-01 17:39:32] <+Not_A_Bug_> Sigma Is better than Rein against Bastion comps or spam comps in low rank
[2023-01-01 17:39:36] <%GreenZero> U can eat ults

[2023-01-01 17:39:50] <$Topsy__Cret> sigma doesnt have footstep sounds, thats OP
[2023-01-01 17:39:50] <%evilstunky> you're talking about matchup into rein but most people dont play rein
[2023-01-01 17:39:52] <luazri> sigma doesn't have footsteps
[2023-01-01 17:39:53] <%+TheTurtleHax> rein legiteats sigma
[2023-01-01 17:39:54] <@%$PayMeToThrow> sigma can rock you as rein Clueless
[2023-01-01 17:39:57] <Obsidianpunchbowl> he has no footsteps auto a tier
[2023-01-01 17:40:15] <maxsonfinn> junker queen pounds on rein tho
[2023-01-01 17:40:16] <%GIRLinMaleBody> what if space is on sigma
[2023-01-01 17:40:17] <%anung> true

[2023-01-01 17:40:36] <CHICKEN2XD> All sigma will do is throw rocks at me. But I am gigachad rein
[2023-01-01 17:40:38] <%+Aceattack> sigma has rock and noob reins don‚Äôt block it
[2023-01-01 17:40:39] <alkololol> im trying to figure out why i keep losing against hog and orisa, orisa just focuses me and i cant kite, and hog just hook 1 shots my team
[2023-01-01 17:40:44] <jonkku101> sigma oneshottaa 200hp
[2023-01-01 17:40:50] <@%$PayMeToThrow> if orisa does her rotation correct she never doesnt have an ability up
[2023-01-01 17:40:51] <maxsonfinn> orisa is f tier cause shes fucking boring to play and its a video game i play for fun
[2023-01-01 17:40:53] <%+TheTurtleHax> sig is okay into other matchups
[2023-01-01 17:40:53] <maxsonfinn> thats why
[2023-01-01 17:40:59] <maxsonfinn> i refuse to ever touch that hero
[2023-01-01 17:41:00] <demonsleyor> finish list
[2023-01-01 17:41:08] <maxsonfinn> i get that
[2023-01-01 17:41:11] <maxsonfinn> shes good ik
[2023-01-01 17:41:16] <%+TheTurtleHax> ball is also secert goodie
[2023-01-01 17:41:18] <%GreenZero> U can push dps out of highground positions
[2023-01-01 17:41:19] <%+TheTurtleHax> i think

[2023-01-01 17:41:27] <luazri> poor Winton
[2023-01-01 17:41:34] <CHICKEN2XD> Yes winton bad
[2023-01-01 17:41:35] <maxsonfinn> ball fucks if you cant counter him
[2023-01-01 17:41:36] <+kelebraska> winston is just too easy to kill even with a support
[2023-01-01 17:41:36] <%anung> I rather take the rock or Doom punch before teammates
[2023-01-01 17:41:38] <avon_blocksdale> ball is ok????
[2023-01-01 17:41:47] <gzone_ow> ball is ok?
[2023-01-01 17:41:48] <Sshpongled> monke  catCry
[2023-01-01 17:41:48] <maxsonfinn> but if u rush their backline ball cant protect his squishies
[2023-01-01 17:41:52] <Retaliator3> Ball is L
[2023-01-01 17:41:54] <+Guts72> Only roadhog beats winston atm
[2023-01-01 17:41:58] <GreysonX> how is ball>dva queen and sig
[2023-01-01 17:42:03] <gzone_ow> ball is the most trash

[2023-01-01 17:42:14] <avon_blocksdale> I mean I saw junkerqueen is top 5 LUL
[2023-01-01 17:42:18] <%evilstunky> ball is good because of nerfs to others
[2023-01-01 17:42:20] <maxsonfinn> ball will never be shit just by his design
[2023-01-01 17:42:23] <%evilstunky> And orisa cant always focus him
[2023-01-01 17:42:24] <maxsonfinn> he is a carry hero
[2023-01-01 17:42:25] <%YoungsterGlenn> Isn't Korea a bunch of Balls
[2023-01-01 17:42:25] <+TheTurtleHax> oh yeah
[2023-01-01 17:42:28] VIEWERS: 837
[2023-01-01 17:42:29] <%anung> but you have to be really good at ball
[2023-01-01 17:42:29] <Wh00pSid3iZi> ball needs buffs
[2023-01-01 17:42:30] <avon_blocksdale> man
[2023-01-01 17:42:40] <%+TheTurtleHax> ball is genuinly good  i think
[2023-01-01 17:42:41] <maxsonfinn> just like how necros could carry on genji all those years the hero was shit
[2023-01-01 17:42:46] <maxsonfinn> good balls will always be good
[2023-01-01 17:42:47] <$Topsy__Cret> @anung obviously, to be rank 1.....
[2023-01-01 17:42:51] <sdsgruu> buff rein
[2023-01-01 17:42:52] <+Not_A_Bug_> tell that to Chazm
[2023-01-01 17:42:53] <%anung> meanwhile you can be mediocre at Orisa and be good
[2023-01-01 17:42:59] <%geno69> if ball gets buffs, supports will just stop playing in most ranks xd
[2023-01-01 17:43:04] <+Synex_ow> master challenger, what happened to shame....
[2023-01-01 17:43:05] <bthagreatfc> Oh no season6 on the team
[2023-01-01 17:43:05] <@%$PayMeToThrow> if rein had speed boost ability this game would be completely balanced
[2023-01-01 17:43:07] <papajis> Ball is good, just hard for people to get good with and their team to play around

[2023-01-01 17:43:15] <Wh00pSid3iZi> @LhCloudy27 why did all the ball players like yeatle stop playing ball then? He feels underwhelming compared to meta tanks
[2023-01-01 17:43:35] <kaymaroarts> gigachad
[2023-01-01 17:43:38] <maxsonfinn> ball is actually easy to play and play with because he does his own thing independent of the rest of the team
[2023-01-01 17:43:45] <+AlexIsBeastmode> Only ball change would be reducing cool down on hook when you spawn.
[2023-01-01 17:43:46] <maxsonfinn> winston is a better ball but requires team workl
[2023-01-01 17:44:02] <sdsgruu> he's just better
[2023-01-01 17:44:07] <Wh00pSid3iZi> he switches ball only when it's good? but he mains other tanks?
[2023-01-01 17:44:09] <%+Aceattack> ppl also hit high ranks otp symmetra
[2023-01-01 17:44:13] <despite_ow> just checked asia leaderboards, rank 2-9 all top played hero is doom, geguri rank 1 playing dva orisa sigma
[2023-01-01 17:44:18] <luazri> ball is good for solo queue experience if you're good with him
[2023-01-01 17:44:20] <hairyarmpitsenjoyer> winston hard af to play
[2023-01-01 17:44:20] <maxsonfinn> see i think winston is a lot harder to play
