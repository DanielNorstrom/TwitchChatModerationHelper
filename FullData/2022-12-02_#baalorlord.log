[2022-12-02 18:12:16] <@%baalorbot> @FaeLyka Lifecoach's Watcher streak ended at 42. However, the first 18 runs of the streak were done long ago, before the latest patches, and the videos no longer exist. As such, I am leaving Merl's record in place, and am asking chat to not engage in debate about this decision. Thank you!

[2022-12-02 18:55:35] <%TheManWithTheEggTattoo> I prefered Masterful stab then dash

[2022-12-02 18:59:54] <%+greasedpiglet> Shivs should be retain
[2022-12-02 18:59:59] <@%Zeuthis> all it takes is Infinite Blades + Nightmare to equal 1 Blade Dance

[2022-12-02 19:00:23] <Aton_Kras> With Shuriken are you less partial to taking accuracy or do you tend to stack and not take many other attacks?
[2022-12-02 19:00:24] <IM_dori> which card is better with pyramid? which we get right after

[2022-12-02 19:00:43] <%qwirkyqwilfish> how much higher difficulty is the inclusion of act 4? Like what level of ascension level without heart is about equivalent to A0H or A1H?
[2022-12-02 19:00:45] <acme12x> Deck is slow, need to remove cards.
[2022-12-02 19:00:47] <spaceofdiamonds> I'd say Nightmare here because I can sense the snecko coming

[2022-12-02 19:11:55] <%qwirkyqwilfish> @Airik2112 in act 1 might be worth seeking out more elites to try and get an egg (since you'll be healing at fires anyway) also check shop if you have enough for apo/eggs, then pick up upgraded cards in acts 2/3

[2022-12-02 19:13:56] <+The_Chardzard> I think the game is pretty good at explaining what you need to know when you start

[2022-12-02 19:14:19] <fivetwoeighty> I say take it by act. Like set the challenge for beating act 1, then act 2, etc.
[2022-12-02 19:14:22] <%+BubbaDoongai> was a lot easier coming to slay the spire from mtg

[2022-12-02 19:14:45] <inukealot69> @Aton_Kras bullet time isn't giving you a buff that reduces card cost, it simply reduces the cards in your current hand to zero so bursting does nothing

[2022-12-02 19:20:51] <%+snakeymoses> I feel like it felt very similar to dicey dungeons - with some of the same problems (for me) around in round decision making being less interesting / repetitive.

[2022-12-02 19:22:38] <%+willaoi> agreed

[2022-12-02 19:22:50] <CouchBunnies> Kaycee's mod makes Inscription replayable
[2022-12-02 19:22:52] <EphemeralAsh> I played griftlands several times but then didn't feeel the need to come back
[2022-12-02 19:22:52] <Filthy_Casual_Magic> Kaycee's Mod!

[2022-12-02 19:22:57] <@%Zeuthis> I want a Silent shop relic that gives you 2x damage on turn one so we can always have PK on... maybe in exchange for 2 fewer cards drawn on turn 1
[2022-12-02 19:22:59] <inukealot69> inscryption was a great game but it was also a somewhat a narrative game so idk about replayable, tho there is the kaycee mod not sure how that is tho
[2022-12-02 19:23:05] <%+lith122> deck just needs sustain
[2022-12-02 19:23:07] <%+rotobagel> This run is basically “we have wrath form at home” Kappa
[2022-12-02 19:23:17] <%malarkey7> i like that some of the newer small indie games haven't been super replayable. Not every game needs to be infinitely replayable
[2022-12-02 19:23:18] <thebramhammer> Inscription was amazing and worth a playthrough, dont watch gameplay if you can help it
[2022-12-02 19:23:19] <CouchBunnies> Kaycee's mod is fantastic
[2022-12-02 19:23:20] <fivetwoeighty> dicey dungeons got me into roguelike deckbuilders, love the mechanic of building a deck around dice mechanics
[2022-12-02 19:23:38] <%qwirkyqwilfish> I need to pick up inscryption
[2022-12-02 19:23:40] <%kaeroku> strangely I felt like Griftlands was *more* replayable in beta, before they made it so that selecting your decks before the game was considered a "custom" mode and gated progress
[2022-12-02 19:23:43] <Aton_Kras> Have you ever tryed Nowhere Prophet? I really loved the visual design, sound design and setting but as a deck builder it is LEAGUES behind spire.
[2022-12-02 19:23:45] <twitchforgotmyaccount> Kaycee's mod (official free dlc) makes the first act replayable.
[2022-12-02 19:23:52] <spaceofdiamonds> @inukealot69 Kaycee's Mod introduces an Ascension mechanic for much greater difficulty and much better replayability.

[2022-12-02 20:26:55] <@%FaeLyka> okay I'll add one (1) restriction: has to be first played card of combat
[2022-12-02 20:27:08] <@%FaeLyka> so vuln is fine cause Bag of Marbles
[2022-12-02 20:27:19] <@%FaeLyka> and ambrosia pot too
[2022-12-02 20:27:22] <%tiefull> but we cant make it 0 cost then, i dont think
[2022-12-02 20:27:25] <+WykedAgent> Combat doesn't start until both sides attack. Otherwise it's just assault.
[2022-12-02 20:27:28] <%Scoopikins> so, in theory, Akebeko + 999 str + Divinity + PK + Phrog with a Heavy Blade+ on a vulnerable enemy should be the most single damage a card could do?
[2022-12-02 20:27:33] <Flinntlock> @tiefull Snecko
[2022-12-02 20:27:37] <@%Tomagathericon> @FaeLyka cant sue phantasmal killer then?

[2022-12-02 20:30:40] <%Scoopikins> I'm figuring that you could line all the things up in a single, regular run of spire, without endless mode, and not factoring in outlying entities like giant head, since getting to 999 slow is basically impossible
[2022-12-02 20:31:28] <%cheezzywizz> getting to 999 slow is really easy with any 0-damage infinite
[2022-12-02 20:31:34] <TheQweryuiop1234> plenty of infinites can go 999 slow
[2022-12-02 20:31:39] <Flinntlock> Yeah, was gonna say. Easy but boring.

[2022-12-02 22:03:48] <%Bbtech0251> It does depend on the relics too
[2022-12-02 22:03:52] <%owlmilk> 2 to 6 relics
[2022-12-02 22:04:13] <%aaNawab> blackstar is both best and worst as a boss swap
[2022-12-02 22:04:13] <Flinntlock> Depends what else you could have taken. I've had it give ~8 extra relics and still lost whereas Pyramid would have won.
[2022-12-02 22:04:20] <%fantasiawht> I was thinking 3.  You're giving up a GOOD relic, so it takes like 2 normal relics to make that up and you're just even (but actually behind because of time value), so the 3rd maybe makes you better off.  4 is probably mostly likely better off in most examples.
[2022-12-02 22:04:32] <%atlas_ww> ...I tuned in and what...did I just see in the deck? is that just an army of powers?

[2022-12-02 22:41:26] <Merik72> @brobrarian i think a lot of people find that if you're already stance changing a lot, you'll already have enough damage from other things to kill. flurry often clogs your draws with low impact cards

[2022-12-02 22:58:04] <Abisionkk> I used to do the math whenever I fought hexaghost to see if resting would put me closer or further to the damage threshold, doubt it was ever worth it LUL
[2022-12-02 22:58:06] <%+ScrapBrainSC2> against hexaghost, your ideal life total for it's first attack is (12*x)-1, so 11, 23, 35, etc.

[2022-12-02 23:00:46] <bekchiofwar> I didn't even notice, what was the card?

[2022-12-02 23:01:18] <SirusTO> I feel like trading cards for energy is almost always very strong given how many draw cards there are, yet I feel like I never see people taking Deus Ex. Any reason why Deus Ex is bad?

[2022-12-02 23:03:39] <spaceofdiamonds> @popmonkey Correct
[2022-12-02 23:03:39] <@%Zeuthis> correct @popmonkey

[2022-12-02 23:03:52] <%Joshprox> the math checks out
[2022-12-02 23:04:04] <Karisa> Apparently that also applies if you pass through the shop and don't look at it-- only matters in seeded runs though
[2022-12-02 23:04:12] <ThisCantHappen> how often do you use smokebomb?
[2022-12-02 23:04:12] <ElderSivart> 3 * 1.5 = 4 + 1.5 conclusion addition and multiplication are identical operations

[2022-12-02 23:05:11] <pepper0ni2> i wonder if smoke make going for the extra elite worth it as you could smoke out
[2022-12-02 23:05:37] <pepper0ni2> that's the real use of smoke I think, it means you can be super aggro pathing a lot of the time
[2022-12-02 23:05:39] VIEWERS: 1 706
[2022-12-02 23:05:47] <popmonkey> throw it on the ground? I thought you consumed it so it would make you produce gas once it passes through
[2022-12-02 23:06:14] <@%Zeuthis> a couple of problems with that, though... often you don't know if you need to use smoke or not until you've taken some damage... and a node you get nothing on is a lost opportunity
[2022-12-02 23:06:39] VIEWERS: 1 706
[2022-12-02 23:06:39] <%Joshprox> I think I use it for hallway fights much more than anything else
[2022-12-02 23:06:39] <pepper0ni2> there's risk reward sure
[2022-12-02 23:06:53] <+Isa2485> I love how "you're dead" was the normal continuation of cards to play LUL
[2022-12-02 23:07:10] <%Joshprox> Snake Plant or Avocado/Rat are sometimes real solid smoke bomb opportunities
[2022-12-02 23:07:19] <%the_wrong_guy> you need to replace smokebomb by a green square potion so it looks neat GivePLZ
[2022-12-02 23:07:37] <@%Zeuthis> I wish I could smoke bomb out of the altar event

[2022-12-02 23:21:43] <%Methlyn> @TheQweryuiop1234 don't diss our lord and savior baalorEyes
[2022-12-02 23:21:50] <twitchforgotmyaccount> @TheQweryuiop1234 It's probably just flat-out the best boss relic in standard temperature and pressure.
[2022-12-02 23:22:00] <@%Zeuthis> @DrPizzazz ah, welcome, I'm just glad the !quotes didn't make the transition to the new bots, because I don't come off so well there LUL
[2022-12-02 23:22:09] <TheQweryuiop1234> sneko eye is potentially better in certain decks, but pyramid is almost always amazing
[2022-12-02 23:22:12] <lanigeralord> is there any ways to look at win percentage by relics/cards?

[2022-12-02 23:22:33] <%2wett> does anyone by chance recall how many boss swaps merl's 38 streak had?
[2022-12-02 23:22:33] <DrPizzazz> Perhaps there should be a "Plunger" Relic that allows you to exhaust 1 card from your hand each turn? Prevents hand "clog."
[2022-12-02 23:22:39] VIEWERS: 1 705
[2022-12-02 23:22:50] <%Methlyn> @TheQweryuiop1234 my issue with pyramid is that when its a win condition, its a really solid win condition. Whereas snecko is just crazy fun always
[2022-12-02 23:22:54] <emrjinc> I feel like the Pyramid is the relic that scales best with expertise of the game.  It's garbage when I pick it, because I'm not good at the game.
[2022-12-02 23:22:54] <TheQweryuiop1234> a relic that gives you exhaust per turn would be insanely broken
[2022-12-02 23:23:01] <%Methlyn> in other words, winning with pyramid can be boring, sometimes
[2022-12-02 23:23:07] <lanigeralord> @DrPizzazz That feels more like an iron clad power
[2022-12-02 23:23:10] <%Joshprox> @Zeuthis aw those are gone? There were some vintage quotes in there
[2022-12-02 23:23:39] <%MrPhishHead> yesterday I was blessed with a snecko eye, double meteor strike, creative ai and mummy hand defect deck baalorEyes
[2022-12-02 23:23:51] <DrPizzazz> @DrPizzazz True, maybe ironclad specific or just stronger for him. Can also be useful for other classes but not as much agreed.
[2022-12-02 23:23:54] <%MrPhishHead> most fun run I've had in awhile

[2022-12-02 23:44:54] <ManicDestroyer79> well, i here the watcher does, "crush joints"
[2022-12-02 23:45:06] <plungahbunnay> if you play fasting last in that sequence do you purge the -1 before the +4 str?
[2022-12-02 23:45:13] <@%FaeLyka> no

[2022-12-02 23:46:56] <bekchiofwar> @plungahbunnay Do you mean with Pellets? It doesn't matter a long as you activate Pellets; the relic works different than artifact.
[2022-12-02 23:47:05] <DrPizzazz> @slamte Not as good as 9 DeeDee
[2022-12-02 23:47:12] <ObadiahTheSlim> Remind yourself that overconfidence is a slow and insidious killer.
[2022-12-02 23:47:20] <plungahbunnay> @bekchiofwar yea was wondering if could still get the extra str
[2022-12-02 23:47:30] <%+ocmu> i haven't been able to watch for a few months, but it's great to find back and see the yearly challenge going so well
[2022-12-02 23:48:34] <bekchiofwar> @plungahbunnay It's nice that the debuff and buff are separate, allows for shenanigans like this.
[2022-12-02 23:48:37] <NovaxDeportovic> is pellets a good relic?

[2022-12-02 23:51:22] <%+odditie613> Today’s takeaway, hyperbeam and stone calendar are essential.
[2022-12-02 23:51:27] <bekchiofwar> @novaxdeportovic If you like Sneko Eye, Pellets isn't great. You still draw 2 extra cards, but you lose the randomizing debuff. Your randomized cards keep their new cost, and expensive cards remain expensive.
[2022-12-02 23:51:30] <plague_1> nice speculative omni as well
[2022-12-02 23:51:41] <+Jaxtonian> Just got back, I see the run failed miserably :)
[2022-12-02 23:52:02] <!Squeak363> @infidelzombie did you see SneakyTeak try to play blindfolded?
[2022-12-02 23:52:05] <dabeeestkuhehehe> being able to exhaust a bad card is nice too
[2022-12-02 23:52:15] <%teutonic_nite> tater time
[2022-12-02 23:52:18] <%Virtual256> Also Omni -> Strike can even be good - removing a card, etc.

[2022-12-02 23:53:13] <Edromesis> A french roguelite streamer takes challenges from chat on some days, he does a poll to get one viewer, the viewer gives a set of rules like "no events run" or "no boss relic run" and the streamer tries to complete the run :)
[2022-12-02 23:53:30] <%haligonian89> @Baalorlord I think it'd be sweet if you did a YouTube video for each of the last 12 runs in the 400 for the 12 days of christmas.

[2022-12-02 23:56:03] <%+BubbaDoongai> I don't bother with survivability on hunter for the most part, killing everything is a form of survivability
[2022-12-02 23:56:05] <%Ashandai> all the enemies in a wave?  can you cap out on enemy spawns??
[2022-12-02 23:56:14] <%Ashandai> man i must be bad at this game lol
[2022-12-02 23:56:33] <OGJ0ker> they do cap out and start to dissapear
[2022-12-02 23:56:39] VIEWERS: 1 269
[2022-12-02 23:56:40] <OGJ0ker> but more will spawn
[2022-12-02 23:56:41] <%simian56> imo you're best off hard focusing crossbows on hunter since they allow you to scale both flat damage and % damage off just the range stat
[2022-12-02 23:56:55] <%Ashandai> oh, so it's not "clearing a screen" its "making sure you dont cap"
[2022-12-02 23:56:58] <+feelmygoods> Finally beat A20 Silent took me an embarassingly long time, died to heart but shrug
[2022-12-02 23:57:43] <OGJ0ker> you could play as pacifist which gives you money for the amount of mobs left on the screen
[2022-12-02 23:58:37] <%doomtrain404> It took me a while to realize this, but armor is so important in this game.  Negative armor makes you take more damage.

[2022-12-02 23:59:17] <OGJ0ker> the best thing about this game is that everything that you are unsure of how it works it just works in the best way possible LuL
