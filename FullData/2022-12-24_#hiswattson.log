[2022-12-24 16:48:02] <+syphon_ac007> @wh1tebeltpanda idk how it works but they easily get out of It because they say something looked fishy. I think most cases only places denying licenses is to buy beer/cigarettes, bars, things like that. they can't take chances so they don't allow It if they feel something is off

[2022-12-24 21:37:42] <%+ch13f_v1k1ng> All of the advice you get disappears when you have a kid. Then it's just you and this little guy you'll call "peanut". He changes the way you see EVERYTHING, and you spend the rest of your life ensuring that he has every opportunity to succeed. At least, that has been my journey.

[2022-12-24 22:51:02] <%trinyta_> üòÖ
[2022-12-24 22:51:02] <%BadChickenTaco> depends on therapist. it can help.
[2022-12-24 22:51:02] <%believelandx12> I go bi-weekly just to work on myself

[2022-12-24 22:51:03] <%elzagore> therapist did not but therapist did
[2022-12-24 22:51:03] <Veraxis> therapy is about finding a good therapist, a lot of them are trash

[2022-12-24 22:51:19] <%trinyta_> im napoli pizza spaghetti
[2022-12-24 22:51:20] <aquacina> therapy as a whole is a scam
[2022-12-24 22:51:20] <Jessca> waste of time
[2022-12-24 22:51:20] <EulasBBL> Made it worse
[2022-12-24 22:51:21] <%l33rerkarton1> You have to be open about it
[2022-12-24 22:51:22] <Krazykiller241> maybe it depends on the therapist
[2022-12-24 22:51:25] <%+GeorgieLive> went to one ending up making her my baby momma...... it's not worth going
[2022-12-24 22:51:25] <aquacina> therapy is subjective
[2022-12-24 22:51:28] <Obbsesiv> therapy is for the weak minded there whole profession is to tell you common sense
[2022-12-24 22:51:28] <%trinyta_> pastaThat pastaThat üçïüçï
[2022-12-24 22:51:29] <@%$Zimpelll> i had the same but i feel like if i would go now it would help
[2022-12-24 22:51:32] <bingblapp> dpends on the therapist i suppose
[2022-12-24 22:51:32] <+Medic_IRL> therapists that have theoretical knowledge and no life experience to draw upon are hopeless, and often detrimental
[2022-12-24 22:51:36] <Omni35> depends on the therapist, some just don't work for you.
[2022-12-24 22:51:36] <SymmetricalIlussion> TheRapist

[2022-12-24 22:51:37] <god_of_furi> Some high thoughts right there
[2022-12-24 22:51:37] <%+BruceTheGrey> my therapist was pregnant and had big knockers
[2022-12-24 22:51:41] <+TheMrPenguini> its good for people who gotta work stuff out. and yeah therapist matters
[2022-12-24 22:51:42] <TrevvyG> need to find someone that works with/for you
[2022-12-24 22:51:43] <EulasBBL> A Dog >>>
[2022-12-24 22:51:43] <%$Niovus> i assume it depends on the therapist, YOU, and the guidelines placed
[2022-12-24 22:51:47] <%l33rerkarton1> There are some that arent really your match
[2022-12-24 22:51:48] <KrispyyRice> a big thing about it is that you need to find one that works for you and you also need to give them time to get to know you
[2022-12-24 22:51:52] <%BadChickenTaco> i rely on meds to stabilize my mood.
[2022-12-24 22:51:55] <TahjTamale> Therapy just makes me more willing to stop receiving oxygen
