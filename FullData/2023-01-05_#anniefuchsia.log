[2023-01-05 00:04:45] <%drzaius30> they already change old mechanics for trust npcs
[2023-01-05 00:05:13] <%drzaius30> its really a matter of were they put the team doing the reworks

[2023-01-05 13:33:32] <%Taylor131313> you must be a certified kekega to fail that dungeon
[2023-01-05 13:34:09] <%Geoffku> when does the average pug start having problems with it?
[2023-01-05 13:34:58] <%Taylor131313> 16-17 if people start missing interrupts left and right
[2023-01-05 13:35:20] <%Geoffku> NOTED
[2023-01-05 13:35:53] <%Taylor131313> then again unless you wipe on a boss after committing lust you're timing the key easily
[2023-01-05 13:36:13] <%PanicRush> 13 is when an average pug starts getting oneshotted by everything and fails SBG, speaking from personal experience
[2023-01-05 13:37:13] <%Geoffku> haven't been in a bad 13+ sbg yet LUL
[2023-01-05 13:37:55] <%Taylor131313> my experience in SBG was not good last night xdd
[2023-01-05 13:38:03] <%Taylor131313> the tank was a certified kekega in that case

[2023-01-05 14:03:02] <%PanicRush> i still hate that dungeon, its so difficult
[2023-01-05 14:03:17] <~%AnnieFuchsia> no stream today!  catching up with things

[2023-01-05 14:03:37] <%PanicRush> anniesHug2 take care
[2023-01-05 14:03:48] <%Taylor131313> really Panic, it felt like almost the easiest to me Hmmge
[2023-01-05 14:03:52] <%drzaius30> no prob Annie have a good day anniesHug2
[2023-01-05 14:04:01] <%Geoffku> have a good one annie anniesHug
[2023-01-05 14:04:02] <%Taylor131313> there's like 3 mechanics on trash overall or so
[2023-01-05 14:04:37] <%PanicRush> one of the 3 mechanics is to switch off my brain so i am sitting staring into the monitor for a minute and die
[2023-01-05 14:04:43] <%Taylor131313> the bad thing about COS is that you need to have a tank who knows exactly what to pull or you'll get 120-130% trash count
[2023-01-05 14:04:53] <%+Hezmund> solo tanked Dathea in LFR as DH after my co-tank got yeeted off and no-one ressed him KEKLEO seems tank stacks cap at 5 in LFR though and as DH I cancel the knockback every time. Easy game
[2023-01-05 14:04:58] <%PanicRush> yea, we had a supa tank
[2023-01-05 14:04:59] <%Taylor131313> xdd
[2023-01-05 14:05:19] <%Taylor131313> besides for that now that they nerfed last boss tyrannical almost has no mechanics
[2023-01-05 14:05:29] <%PanicRush> i mean, i've been telling this since week 1 of our guild raids - DH ignores all the mechanics on Dathea LULW
[2023-01-05 14:05:42] <%Taylor131313> all damage on 1st boss is basically avoidable, on 2nd you just need to have enough AOE to nuke imps, 3rd boss much easier now
[2023-01-05 14:06:18] <%PanicRush> i even stopped running away from the cyclones - if it sucks you in all you get is a knock up that you ignore with glide and while you are in the air, you dont take dmg from the dot
[2023-01-05 14:06:29] <%Taylor131313> anniesDude that's cheating
[2023-01-05 14:06:31] <%PanicRush> literally makes it easier for you and for the healers

[2023-01-05 21:26:10] <%Taylor131313> last phase while still not make any sense looks like a walk in the park compared to the previous
[2023-01-05 21:26:15] <%Taylor131313> it's just a 'don't die' phase
[2023-01-05 21:26:55] <%drzaius30> ye most raiders who cleared said it was basically a victory lap
[2023-01-05 21:27:08] <%drzaius30> phase 7 that is
[2023-01-05 21:27:28] <%JurgenRapp> it's a hard victorylap :D
[2023-01-05 21:27:39] <%Taylor131313> they didn't even see the enrage cast this time, they must have been way ahead

[2023-01-05 21:33:03] <%drzaius30> very religious weapons peepoChrist
[2023-01-05 21:36:14] <%Taylor131313> can you farm ultimate weapons over and over or you're locked to one per week?
[2023-01-05 21:37:16] <%drzaius30> i thought it was locked but i guess not
[2023-01-05 21:37:53] <%drzaius30> or the lockout is lifted since we on 6.25
[2023-01-05 21:38:00] <%drzaius30> and this was 6.11
[2023-01-05 21:38:23] <%drzaius30> actually 6.28

[2023-01-05 21:53:06] <%Wardrick7> i love how i cant get in to +16 but +14 i get insta invite xdd
[2023-01-05 21:55:27] <%Taylor131313> 2 keys level at that range add a lot more difficulty than they used to
[2023-01-05 21:56:13] <%Taylor131313> like last week, I did SBG 17 and it was child's play, in the 18 we lusted the 2 void thingies before last boss because we were getting railed hard monkaS
[2023-01-05 21:56:24] <%Taylor131313> group wasn't the best but it was big ouchie
[2023-01-05 21:56:56] <%Taylor131313> last season you wouldn't feel a 1 key level difference that much
[2023-01-05 22:06:28] <%Aegis_2566> Just never invite an evoker healer to anything and you're good to go
[2023-01-05 22:06:55] <%Taylor131313> evokers are like
[2023-01-05 22:07:02] <%Aegis_2566> useless
[2023-01-05 22:07:03] <%Taylor131313> sometimes maybe good, sometimes maybe shit
[2023-01-05 22:08:16] <%Taylor131313> I just find the range a big limit so if I have another source of lust I just invite a druid xdd
[2023-01-05 22:09:46] <%Aegis_2566> As I said, useless
[2023-01-05 22:41:25] <@%Mongbat25> F twitch
