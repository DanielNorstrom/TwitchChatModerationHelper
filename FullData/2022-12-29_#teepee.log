[2022-12-29 16:05:47] <+DeanCavs> @TeePee are you getting sleep while the baby sleeps?
[2022-12-29 16:05:47] <%+flipjoe21> once the baby eats more solid and more active, they sleep more
[2022-12-29 16:05:52] <%$Redhead_Lunatic> instead of kids watching Curious George or Cyberchase before school they have resorted to watching Sym....
[2022-12-29 16:05:56] <%cobrakai1284> I mean, I’m old AF
[2022-12-29 16:05:57] <%+thurstee44> I feel like a million bucks anytime my twin 3 year olds sleep past 5:30 in the morning.

[2022-12-29 16:06:07] <%+xAgentSe7en> I do recall you saying a couple weeks ago she had a random 7 hour - she's locking in slowly but surely!!
[2022-12-29 16:06:12] <%frostypurpz23> Love my little girl she’s a little me
[2022-12-29 16:06:15] <%+soulvaki> @elv1s6 Def. I see that in myself
[2022-12-29 16:06:18] <%+mikezr1> I feel like no one’s trying out of these 4. Thoughts?
[2022-12-29 16:06:21] <%frostypurpz23> So she reminds me a lot of my mom
[2022-12-29 16:06:25] <mattyd054> I still remember the first time my kid slept through the night and me and my wife woke up asking what time we had to feed the baby. Hopefully she continues the trend for you @teepee
[2022-12-29 16:06:26] <+cda__1> @TeePee have to sleep train the baby. I've done it with 2 now. Both of them sleep 12 hours a night, every night.
[2022-12-29 16:06:33] <@%Shedhead_> too EZ
[2022-12-29 16:06:34] <%+LocsNGlocks> Dang those guys were so lost
[2022-12-29 16:06:34] <!%bpc2010> Once they finally sleep consistently, you get used to it and then bam, one night they sleep regress and it’s extremely frustrating
[2022-12-29 16:06:38] <%+xAgentSe7en> those guys were worse than the AI jeez
[2022-12-29 16:06:39] <%cobrakai1284> @tritttycent sounds right
[2022-12-29 16:06:42] <%frostypurpz23> Been going through a little depression since her passing but man she looks like her acts like her
[2022-12-29 16:06:42] <icecoldh2os> We took our son to a pediatric chiropractor and it helped his sleep a ton @TeePee

You can also get a month of prime for free or students get either 6 or 12 months prime for free! If trying to sub on mobile, iPhone users have to go to the desktop version of twitch.

[2022-12-29 18:53:54] <%+iiFawn> @teepee prob already know but for the last couple days I’d tune attachments and then over the course of the day, the tuning would just reset back to zero, so I had to keep tuning it over and over. Now it lets you save a tuned setup and that has seemed to fix it. I think. Although some times I’m still getting a different gun than what I purchase from the buy station. This just me or a known bug?

[2022-12-29 19:07:29] <%incognino> @TeePee I use the other suppressor because of the quicker Aim down sight, most fights I take are mid range, so if its a long range im usually mounted and the initial recoil is negligible

[2022-12-29 23:55:37] <@%^Streamlabs> TeeP has always played Warzone on PC. Typically he plays with a controller, but switches to MKB often to keep the game feeling new. He made the switch to PC for better frames and better FOV | - !ibp | - !specs | for more info | #sponsored |
