[2022-12-26 01:14:33] <StockSavage> @jibberjabstep its actually performant, and the worst bug ive seen is doors being open when they should be closed. pretty nice accomplishment for pre-beta
[2022-12-26 01:14:34] <Farfignueton> I have the same problem as those zombies- if i get scared, i pinch it too
[2022-12-26 01:14:35] <+jibberjabstep> @brykanst Tarkov is held together with ductape and broken dreams rather than anything resembling a game engine.
[2022-12-26 01:14:39] <%+KimSchlongUn69420> @Sequisha u think not being able to see kill feed is good ?
[2022-12-26 01:14:44] <%+brykanst> @PiecesOfMyArt that is more to do with the content creators than it does the absence of the game
[2022-12-26 01:14:50] <%PhilRamirez> sequisha goes like 10 rooms without seeing a soul, when i play i get one room in and there's a tri ready to reem my ass
[2022-12-26 01:15:04] <%+brykanst> @jibberjabstep isn't tarkov made in unity or something stupid
[2022-12-26 01:15:08] <+HermitStew> something I love about this game is how the depth of the game is high (think PvP x PvE = tons of scenarios), but slapped with a simple and intuitive UI + player controls to digest it all
[2022-12-26 01:15:12] <+jibberjabstep> @StockSavage IronMace really fucking nailed it imo. I'm incredibly stoked to see this game progress

[2022-12-26 01:16:41] <%+brykanst> @jibberjabstep and there in lies the problem unity is great for small studios with no budget but to make a good game in it is asking a ton... lucky for these devs they might be small but they have a basically limitless budget

[2022-12-26 02:11:04] <+lawthahost> minibosses should have some kinda ranged attack they use if you attack with ranged without them to retaliate
[2022-12-26 02:11:05] <+Kinkyftw> Best way for both Boss kills you run 2 rangers. they're so strong
[2022-12-26 02:11:05] <%perichoresislive> yes, stone the whores

[2022-12-26 02:11:11] <%+haaaake> Skeletons could throw their spare bones at you

[2022-12-26 02:11:17] <+Sam_Hall_> @Frusa where have you seen that info? that's not what was announced in the Discord. they only stated a global end time, which converts to your local time.
[2022-12-26 02:11:18] <Hunter7777_> they should pull off their own arms and throw them at you

[2022-12-26 02:11:40] <oAvron> Cheese is delicious
[2022-12-26 02:11:43] <ImTrin> im lactose intolerant, so no cheese KEKW
[2022-12-26 02:11:43] <Korkone> @AlaskanShrake ye probably
[2022-12-26 02:11:43] <Big_Headed_Gamer> they need to implement that for all games where it applies. cheesing in games where everything looks so realistic graphically these days just feels bad FeelsBadMan
[2022-12-26 02:11:44] <+cystio> oh
[2022-12-26 02:11:47] <%Tavintha> I agree, throw rocks, spit, swing up or down

[2022-12-26 02:11:59] <IAmThurmal> just replace all enemies with skeleton magesx

[2022-12-26 02:12:20] <%dukewildwood> Simple solution seems to be to just make them so you can’t get on them to cheese like that
