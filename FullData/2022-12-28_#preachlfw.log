[2022-12-28 08:36:19] <%Criptonix100> Bwop Morning
[2022-12-28 08:37:05] <%Zeroslayer> Bwop TeaTime Morning
[2022-12-28 08:38:32] <%Criptonix100> I bought and played Elden Ring...it was horrible KEKW
[2022-12-28 08:39:08] <%Zeroslayer> Well that's a take.
[2022-12-28 08:39:35] <%Zeroslayer> Performance or gameplay?
[2022-12-28 08:39:44] <%Criptonix100> Perfomance
[2022-12-28 08:39:54] <%Criptonix100> I tried to play on 900p...I couldn't
[2022-12-28 08:39:59] <%Zeroslayer> Yeah thought so
[2022-12-28 08:40:11] <%Criptonix100> and 720p was really bad for my eyes
[2022-12-28 08:40:39] <%Zeroslayer> The steam deck can handle it quite fine at that res but it's obviously a smaller screen.
[2022-12-28 08:40:53] <%Criptonix100> yeah...
[2022-12-28 08:41:03] <zreiii> Bedge
[2022-12-28 08:41:16] <%Criptonix100> mine is 1080 so 900p is kinda the norm for me for perfomance
[2022-12-28 08:41:22] <%Zeroslayer> @zreiii We Madge TeaTime ?
[2022-12-28 08:41:28] <%Criptonix100> played other games on 900p and it was great
[2022-12-28 08:41:46] <zreiii> @Zeroslayer i couldnt think of any better time to be Madge
[2022-12-28 08:42:12] <zreiii> leveling crafters and gatherers on the ffxiv trial sent me down a dark path lol
[2022-12-28 08:42:24] <%Zeroslayer> @criptonix100 Kinda reminds me of when I pre-ordered witcher 3 back in the day. Couldn't run it when I started it KEKW
[2022-12-28 08:42:39] <%Zeroslayer> Waited years to finally have a pc that could run it.
[2022-12-28 08:42:52] <%Criptonix100> and tbh the writing was very weird on this souls game...wtf did From rush the game? what's happend to the game industry? KEKW
[2022-12-28 08:43:14] <%Criptonix100> @Zeroslayer ouch
[2022-12-28 08:43:31] <%Zeroslayer> Maidenless KEKW
[2022-12-28 08:43:54] <%Criptonix100> I think I played too much Dragon's Dogma and loved that game KEKW
[2022-12-28 08:44:05] <%Zeroslayer> KEKW
[2022-12-28 08:44:48] <%Criptonix100> Gregorio voice > Elden Ring intro voice KEKL
[2022-12-28 08:44:50] <%+Tibbroar> Bwop TeaTime
[2022-12-28 08:45:01] <%Zeroslayer> I love both games but going from one to another can feel weird.
[2022-12-28 08:45:22] <%Criptonix100> yeah I know lol
[2022-12-28 08:46:31] <%Zeroslayer> Oh yeah btw. I'm switching out my ultrawide monitor for a standard 16:9. Now I don't have to find obscure mod fixes for games like dragon's dogma just to play it without black borders KEKW
[2022-12-28 08:47:03] <%Criptonix100> gotta wait for Dragon's Dogma 2 I guess @Zeroslayer KEKW
[2022-12-28 08:47:39] <%Zeroslayer> Oh I hope they keep some of the BS stuff in the sequel just to piss off new players KEKL
[2022-12-28 08:47:51] <%Criptonix100> same map, probably same story afterall Dragon's Dogma is like a souls game
[2022-12-28 08:47:56] <%Zeroslayer> @Tibbroar Bwop morning
[2022-12-28 08:48:06] <nahey> Bwop loud !
[2022-12-28 08:48:08] <%Criptonix100> @Tibbroar Morning Bwop
[2022-12-28 08:48:22] <%Zeroslayer> @nahey Bwop no u!
[2022-12-28 08:48:41] <nahey> :O
[2022-12-28 08:48:46] <%Zeroslayer> kaneko5Wiggly
[2022-12-28 08:49:56] <%Zeroslayer> Madge TeaTime Where strummer?
[2022-12-28 08:51:10] <%Criptonix100> you know...after I played Elden Ring, I can also agree that Elden Ring and Dark Souls 3 made the souls game lost it's value by making it harder
[2022-12-28 08:51:56] <%Criptonix100> I member when the first souls was only just a simple puzzle game and a bit of rolling on other bosses other than just an infestation of rolling KEKW
[2022-12-28 08:52:57] <%Zeroslayer> Never thought I'd see someone describe a souls game as a puzzle game Bwop
[2022-12-28 08:53:16] <%Criptonix100> @Zeroslayer then perhaps you haven't played Demon Souls
[2022-12-28 08:53:47] <%Zeroslayer> I have played the original demon's souls on ps3
[2022-12-28 08:54:06] <%Zeroslayer> Didn't finish it though but got more than half way through.
[2022-12-28 08:55:01] <%Criptonix100> in that game you had to think...that first Boletaria boss? Bombs will do the trick, the huge knight on boletaria? kill the adds first and then either kill the boss from the top or you can melee it
[2022-12-28 08:55:02] <%Zeroslayer> ... I had a habit of getting interested in other games so I never finished a souls game except for elden ring when it released KEKL
[2022-12-28 08:56:40] <%Criptonix100> did you know that one of the bosses in demon souls in that annoying prison place was fairly easy if you could just use your stick very slightly instead of running? KEKW
[2022-12-28 08:56:40] <%Zeroslayer> Think they just replaced that kind of "puzzle" with figuring out the movesets of the bosses instead as the "puzzle".
[2022-12-28 08:57:13] <%Zeroslayer> Oh yeah the blind dude!
[2022-12-28 08:58:17] <%Criptonix100> oh yeah and the other blind dude on flying mantras place where you could easy farm souls there KEKW
[2022-12-28 08:59:03] <%Zeroslayer> Though those gimmick boss fights still exist even in Elden Ring... for example there's a boss where you have to use a certain weapon and then the boss is super easy... I ignored the game's intentions and killed it with my katana instead GIGACHAD
[2022-12-28 09:01:39] <%Criptonix100> anyway...I can agree that they made them on Dark Souls series more of a figuring out the move set than puzzle but on Dark Souls 3 I feel like they they went beyond and made them a lot more rolling required than I remember it was in DS1(I don't want to talk about DS2 KEKW )
[2022-12-28 09:02:13] <%Zeroslayer> Nobody likes DS2 coming from ds1 KEKW
[2022-12-28 09:02:30] <%Zeroslayer> It did have better pvp though
[2022-12-28 09:02:57] <%Zeroslayer> But I'll still give it a chance when I get around to it.
[2022-12-28 09:04:07] <%Zeroslayer> Think after I'm done with going through the ffxiv story again. I'll play ff10 then 12 and then the souls series.
[2022-12-28 09:04:54] <%Zeroslayer> I'm not playing demon's souls again till it's out on pc Stare
[2022-12-28 09:05:01] <%Criptonix100> did you play Nier ver root square of 1.5? or I'll Madge
[2022-12-28 09:05:43] <%Zeroslayer> I only played through the first 3 playthroughs of nier automata Madge
[2022-12-28 09:05:43] <%Criptonix100> I might buy that game eventually for Ending E KEKW
[2022-12-28 09:06:13] <%Criptonix100> Madge you are like mike you don't like NieR Madge play ma game
[2022-12-28 09:06:43] <%Zeroslayer> You know I actually should focus on nier automata and nier replicant before souls Madge
[2022-12-28 09:07:09] <%Criptonix100> just kidding KEKW but let me remind you NieR Gestalt/Replicant is a lot diffrent than Automata
[2022-12-28 09:07:18] <%Zeroslayer> *ThiS CaNNot CoNTiNue* Madge
[2022-12-28 09:07:48] <%Zeroslayer> Gestalt on pc when Madge
[2022-12-28 09:08:16] <%Zeroslayer> I did play a few hours of replicant. It's fun Madge
[2022-12-28 09:08:24] <%Criptonix100> it would have made Mike cry if he played NieR Replicant
[2022-12-28 09:08:33] <%Zeroslayer> Madge TeaTime Where strummer
[2022-12-28 09:08:35] <%Criptonix100> ...and finished it
[2022-12-28 09:09:12] <%Criptonix100> brb gotta listen to that 'music' of NieR Replicant again
[2022-12-28 09:09:28] <%Zeroslayer> NODDERS
[2022-12-28 09:09:55] <%Zeroslayer> Dunno which one but I wanna discover it myself
[2022-12-28 09:11:04] <%Criptonix100> sadly I have never experienced Ending E on OG NieR(game) because it never existed both on NieR Gestalt and RepliCant only on a japanesee book aka on Russian forums you could find it translated KEKW )
[2022-12-28 09:11:38] <%Zeroslayer> lol
[2022-12-28 09:13:26] <%Criptonix100> tbh if Mike loves his brother a lot I think Replicant will do for me too
[2022-12-28 09:13:30] <%Criptonix100> him*
[2022-12-28 09:26:58] <%+Tibbroar> damn it's kinda warm outside, where the hell did that come from
[2022-12-28 09:27:58] <%Criptonix100> where do you live? around the frontline is like 2/3 C
[2022-12-28 09:28:19] <%+Tibbroar> it's all the way up to -4 C in michigan
[2022-12-28 09:28:30] <%+Tibbroar> that's practically tropical right now
[2022-12-28 09:28:38] <%Criptonix100> KEKW
[2022-12-28 09:29:19] <%+Tibbroar> by the end of february i'll be calling -10 unbearably hot
[2022-12-28 09:29:35] <%Criptonix100> why did I even say "around the frontline"...
[2022-12-28 09:29:52] <%Criptonix100> let me see how much far i am from the frontline sec
[2022-12-28 09:30:32] <%Criptonix100> 1250 km woo!
[2022-12-28 09:30:59] <%+Tibbroar> how far is that in US midwestern distance? KEKW
[2022-12-28 09:31:11] <%+Tibbroar> (aka, how long does it take to make that drive)
[2022-12-28 09:31:28] <%Criptonix100> around 777 miles
[2022-12-28 09:31:36] <%Criptonix100> 776.7 to be exact
[2022-12-28 09:32:06] <%+Tibbroar> okay, so around 10-11 hours, not too bad
[2022-12-28 09:32:32] <%Criptonix100> yeah...about the mountains tho KEKW
[2022-12-28 09:32:47] <%Criptonix100> I put a straight line from Romania to Ukraine KEKW
[2022-12-28 09:32:51] <%+Tibbroar> that does complicate things
[2022-12-28 09:33:16] <%+Tibbroar> the nerve of those mountains just being all in the way and stuff Madge
[2022-12-28 09:36:14] <%Criptonix100> 1k miles to get there with the most optimal route I could put
[2022-12-28 09:36:25] <%Thefatkid145> Bwop
[2022-12-28 09:36:35] <%Criptonix100> and that's 1700 km
[2022-12-28 09:37:05] <%Criptonix100> that's some good news...the bad news is that we got some refugees near us
[2022-12-28 09:38:28] <%Criptonix100> 333.4 km aka 207.1 miles near me (sorry Serbians)
[2022-12-28 09:38:50] <%+Tibbroar> better for people to be out of the way of the fighting at least
[2022-12-28 09:39:50] <%Criptonix100> Yeah you are right
[2022-12-28 09:40:11] <%+Tibbroar> side note: i'm still mad fortnite put the marvel character i want most in a paid pack instead of for vbucks Madge
[2022-12-28 09:40:27] <%+Tibbroar> well, 2nd most, they didn't add the one i want most
[2022-12-28 09:41:36] <%+Tibbroar> didn't add Nova and put Captain Marvel in a paid bundle Madge
[2022-12-28 09:42:47] <%Criptonix100> oh boy another lawsuit awaits for Epic?
[2022-12-28 09:43:52] <%Criptonix100> on a side note: I gotta love living the poor man's side of life

[2022-12-28 09:45:18] <%Criptonix100> even tho my family gets 2500-ish lei(500 euros) we get it very late so we gotta rely on debit KEKW
[2022-12-28 09:45:51] <%+Tibbroar> hah, i am one of the least lawsuit-happy people you will ever meet
[2022-12-28 09:46:31] <%Criptonix100> and by family I mean "just my mom" Sadge
[2022-12-28 09:48:14] <%Criptonix100> I wonder how is life in USA is it worse than here in Romania?
