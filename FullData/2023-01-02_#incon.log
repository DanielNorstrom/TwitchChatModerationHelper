[2023-01-02 18:05:40] <%+lightforceten> just why
[2023-01-02 18:05:42] <+Slothity216> mostly because its trash

[2023-01-02 18:07:01] <EUPHORIC> How you doin dood
[2023-01-02 18:07:04] <%+Calvinman4> like if the phrase was "there's more than one way to skin a deer"
[2023-01-02 18:07:07] <%+lightforceten> feeding two birds with one... something that birds eat i guess
[2023-01-02 18:07:15] <%+Calvinman4> that makes sense bc people do skin deers
[2023-01-02 18:07:28] <%+Calvinman4> when that phrase was created were people skinning cats

[2023-01-02 18:07:40] <%+lightforceten> @Calvinman4 maybe it used to be there's more than one way to skin a person and they scaled it back

[2023-01-02 18:28:42] <@%$air2jodran3> interesting
[2023-01-02 18:28:42] <%+Calvinman4> there are several alternate endings for Clue that all play in a row
[2023-01-02 18:28:42] <%FloridianAidan> i think i firmly prefer Knives Out, but Glass Onion was a fun watch for sure
[2023-01-02 18:28:46] <%+Calvinman4> like "or, it could have happened this way":
[2023-01-02 18:28:54] <%+Calvinman4> but in theaters, it only played one ending, and each theater played a different one
[2023-01-02 18:29:10] <%+Calvinman4> so everyone would watch the movie and then they'd talk to their friends and be like "what are you talkikng about"

[2023-01-02 20:49:32] <%+lightforceten> tortellini is more similar to tentacles, and is therefore a more acceptable misspelling of sqidward's last name

[2023-01-02 20:51:55] <+WhatDothLife> alfredo is just mac & cheese for adults
[2023-01-02 20:51:57] <LettuceCat> alfredo is not real

[2023-01-02 20:52:03] <%+raya_eris> how about gnocchi
[2023-01-02 20:52:04] <+Tomahawk1x> alfredo from scratch is pretty good. Canned is way sub-par.
[2023-01-02 20:52:07] <sw33tn3ss034> Alfredo is so over rater

[2023-01-02 20:52:45] <+WhatDothLife> I work in a family owned Italian restaurant. We don't put alfredo on the menu but we make it when people request it and I make fun of them silently in my head.

[2023-01-02 21:16:48] <%purplecloudz> So instead of boots, they will bring in gloves?
