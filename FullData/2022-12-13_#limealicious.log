[2022-12-13 20:46:51] <bayronbunbun> @peekas0 it actually makes a difference if the dwarf gets into melee since they stop shooting arrows and beging clubbing their target wit hthe actual bow, but at that point your dwarf is dead regardless of what the bow is made out of

[2022-12-13 21:39:03] <ughdontmakemeregister> i think you could use more miners, 2 miners is not that many in a fort of over 100

[2022-12-13 21:53:46] <%bruddahPeetz> @SlipperyElm Best way I can describe it quickly is, you get a cave in if there's an unsupported floor on a higher level.
[2022-12-13 21:54:12] <SlipperyElm> @bruddahPeetz So like if I dig out two identically-sized rooms right on top of eachother, the top one'll collapse..?

[2022-12-13 21:54:45] <%bruddahPeetz> @SlipperyElm Not exactly. If you completely mine out a level, you still have the floor intact

[2022-12-13 22:06:24] <bayronbunbun> you can go with a rimworld mindset and care for every dwarf individual needs, but you'll go mad

[2022-12-13 22:06:30] <%$earin_copper> That’s why when I played I used to set the pop cap to about 15

[2022-12-13 22:06:31] <BrutalM3lon> Nice explanation, I think I'm more of a Factorio person. I'm less people manager, and more product manager lol
[2022-12-13 22:06:33] <hazelberrypie> It's interesting because when I started playing rimworld that's what I wanted was a larger colony sim, but over time I ended up preferring the smaller scale of rimworld

[2022-12-13 22:06:44] <%orbitaltuna> you can keep the pop cap small

[2022-12-13 22:07:02] <%$distractedcamel> LUL figuring out how to limit the stuff I decorate with gems is my proudest achievement so far, the trick is limiting the stockpile
[2022-12-13 22:07:03] <%Mortal_Quinn> @hesh4err I bet someone's working on a mod for that
[2022-12-13 22:07:09] <%GridlineXYZ> Even though I'm too dumb for Dwarf Fort I just like being here for the vibes limesComfy
[2022-12-13 22:07:15] <bayronbunbun> bins and bags count as furniture, if you don't keep close eye to your gem dwarves they'll pimp out the entirety of your stockpile tools and none of your actual furniture
[2022-12-13 22:07:18] <%JefFunk> D:
[2022-12-13 22:07:19] <%zman12380> Isn't there a default limit of 200?
[2022-12-13 22:07:21] <Senaro> i heard someone compare this game to an ant farm
[2022-12-13 22:07:21] <%+smol_bloof> you will get to know one dwarf and watch as they crush their arms in a cave-in, spending the rest of their life failing to pick up a cup because you didn't set up a hospital. Not that that's ever happened to me, just something I heard. SMOrc
[2022-12-13 22:07:22] <%bruddahPeetz> I don't think they'll auto decorate with gems unless you just set "Decorate Furniture with Gems" and don't restrict it...
[2022-12-13 22:07:23] <SlipperyElm> You can turn them into a flesh computer too

[2022-12-13 23:33:11] <%TsunamiAromatic> I think they might have made it easier.
[2022-12-13 23:33:12] <%JoJo0217> easy to learn, hard to master

[2022-12-13 23:33:24] <@Vargskelethor> i think its because dwarf inspired games have normalized this kind of ant sim gameplay
[2022-12-13 23:33:24] <%+LastHazzerd> i think that speaks to how much they've made the game more accessible
[2022-12-13 23:33:25] <%orbitaltuna> what's the savagery level of this plot?
[2022-12-13 23:33:33] <@Vargskelethor> so its been a good entry point into the genre

[2022-12-13 23:33:43] <bayronbunbun> no its fine, it usually takes a few years for goblins to notice your fort and their first expeditions can be fend off by civilian dwarf moth balling them
[2022-12-13 23:33:44] <+DormantFlame> yeah I notice sometimes they just don't do tasks 🤔

[2022-12-13 23:34:00] <@Vargskelethor> nono i liked rimworld, i streamed it a couple of times, its just a bit different from this
[2022-12-13 23:34:01] <%+LastHazzerd> @Laimubot oh NO
[2022-12-13 23:34:03] <samiam1616> I think when the Steam Release actually came out you had a lot of devs saying their game was inspired by Dwarf Fortress
[2022-12-13 23:34:05] <@Vargskelethor> where a good fort gets automated
[2022-12-13 23:34:05] <$Walopoh> RimWorld didn't have enough beards vargDorf

[2022-12-13 23:34:11] <densvenske22> asymmetrical
[2022-12-13 23:34:16] <samiam1616> They're different games
[2022-12-13 23:34:17] <@Vargskelethor> this is more influencing the dwarves themselves
[2022-12-13 23:34:21] <%+LastHazzerd> Rimeworld is a lot more hands on
[2022-12-13 23:34:23] <%TsunamiAromatic> both games are good
[2022-12-13 23:34:30] <人魚ヴーパー (vapormermaid)> It's fun to see people new to DF stream it and not immediately get overwhelmed with the controls and graphics.
[2022-12-13 23:34:34] <@Vargskelethor> for lore, the real name of this game is slaves to armok: dwarf fortress
[2022-12-13 23:34:35] <@%Greygull> It's been a lot of "rimworld is inspired by DF, but the way the games are approached is dramatically different"
[2022-12-13 23:34:38] <@Vargskelethor> armok is the real god of this
[2022-12-13 23:34:39] <%Spinel97> limesButt
[2022-12-13 23:34:41] <@Vargskelethor> and YOU are armok
[2022-12-13 23:34:45] <+DormantFlame> I like rimworld, but I don't like them asking for a bunch of money for DLCs
[2022-12-13 23:34:47] <@Vargskelethor> and you are the good of blood
[2022-12-13 23:34:48] <%jakebikay> @Vargskelethor :)
[2022-12-13 23:34:50] <@Vargskelethor> for better or worse
[2022-12-13 23:34:56] <samiam1616> I've seen the comparison like - Rimworld is more of a "game" in how it throws obstacles at you and does it in a very videogame way. Dwarf Fortress everything that happens to you has been built on top of a bunch of existing variables that make up your world?
[2022-12-13 23:35:00] <%TsunamiAromatic> You have less control in DF for sure
[2022-12-13 23:35:00] <@%Greygull> wait are you actually Armok, is that the actual in-lore context
[2022-12-13 23:35:05] <!%Laimubot> why does everyone in the back kill
[2022-12-13 23:35:05] <samiam1616> something like that

[2022-12-13 23:35:41] <%jakebikay> @Spinel97 some random guy named joey hacked the channel and made himself a mod

[2022-12-13 23:36:25] <$Walopoh> "As implied by his role of reshaping reality for the sake of his own amusement, Armok is essentially an in-lore name for the player of the game." huh!

[2022-12-13 23:56:26] <tjo626262> I tried learning this game 5 yrs ago with the ascii graphics It blows my mind people play it like that
[2022-12-13 23:56:31] <%AK_Zephyr> I've just embraced the 'natural' non symmetric layout

[2022-12-13 23:56:48] <%MeleeTechie> @DevinChadde limesHi
[2022-12-13 23:56:56] <%TsunamiAromatic> I've been trying a new layout where I just make curvy hallways and build off them
[2022-12-13 23:57:07] <smaug133> @tjo626262 *insert matrix code meme*
[2022-12-13 23:57:09] <%$Zotiza> @DevinChadde limesHi

[2022-12-13 23:57:17] <%MeleeTechie> PauseChamp big brain moment
[2022-12-13 23:57:22] <%TsunamiAromatic> If I run into a vein I just turn it into another hallway

[2022-12-13 23:57:49] <DevinChadde> @TsunamiAromatic Be careful with curvy rooms and hallways. They are really bad for DF pathfinding and may cause weird bugs

[2022-12-13 23:58:23] <%TsunamiAromatic> @DevinChadde I know, I don't tend to keep forts long enough to run into that, and apparently pathfinding isn't as much of an issue as we thought

[2022-12-13 23:58:49] <!%Laimubot> That was a little bit ago, but you can save ammo slots with no new york
[2022-12-13 23:58:52] <DevinChadde> Had to retire my old fort because some merchants were stuck and unable to depart as they got lost in my curvy room
[2022-12-13 23:59:00] <%Kilil> @Laimubot zaqList I see...
[2022-12-13 23:59:04] <bayronbunbun> remember the lesson: public infrastructure should accomodate for a growing population
