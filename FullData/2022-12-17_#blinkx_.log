[2022-12-17 14:33:14] <fxkiller81> hi
[2022-12-17 14:33:17] <+Valientt> so I was reading a book about gender bias and one of the things they claimed was that Viagra is really good for period pain but that they pulled the plug on the research for fear it would stop men from taking it if they found out LUL
[2022-12-17 14:33:25] <TechnoWeknes> hello
[2022-12-17 14:33:28] <%$Skydor69> Everytime we use our heater, it trips the fuse after it shuts off. SO I have to switch the fuse back on to use it again lol
[2022-12-17 14:33:30] <@%$heavymetalrules> the snow is so sparse now
[2022-12-17 14:33:39] <Jamestivire> Did you get snow in london the other day?

[2022-12-17 14:33:52] <fxkiller81> you need to make the air out of the heater
[2022-12-17 14:34:08] <+HvyMetal62> OK. I'm caught up. But yes, wash new clothes before wearing them. you have no idea whose nasty parts have been in them?
[2022-12-17 14:34:15] <+Stannington> Icey rain in Sheffield and windy. I went shopping this morning and have only just thawed out
[2022-12-17 14:34:17] <CowboyAquatica> yo i aint taken no pill that make nani blood stop
[2022-12-17 14:34:23] <+Valientt> I guess they worry that if it was associated with being taken for period pains that it would make it less "manly"
[2022-12-17 14:34:28] <Yajo89> that wooden wall on the right looks really nice
[2022-12-17 14:34:40] <%$Skydor69> I never washed new clothes either

[2022-12-17 14:38:09] <+Valientt> ED is not just a physical thing, taking a pill to make it work is often avoiding the real issue
[2022-12-17 14:38:11] <@%$heavymetalrules> I mean if your pp doesn't work and you don't take viagra she's still gonna know
[2022-12-17 14:38:15] <CowboyAquatica> naw most men who "cant get it up" just need more foreplay we just like women
[2022-12-17 14:38:18] <Stormtrooper2212> sooo true
[2022-12-17 14:38:22] <%$stilldeadshot4841> Most women wont mind the pp. Its not the plane. Its the pilot blinkxK
[2022-12-17 14:38:39] <!%AmontilladoWolf> Yeah maybe
[2022-12-17 14:38:46] <%syzurp1> A lot of things can lead to ED. Majority of it is mental

[2022-12-17 14:39:58] <Yajo89> maybe cause im from Holland and we got a different attitude towads it but viagra is pretty normal, although most use camagra
[2022-12-17 14:40:00] <!%AmontilladoWolf> I think for younger men that might be more of a mental thing, probably better alternatives than viagra

[2022-12-17 14:45:16] <CowboyAquatica> When one of your nerves is cut or damaged, it will try to repair itself. The nerve fibres (axons) shrink back and 'rest' for about a month; then they begin to grow again. Axons will regenerate about 1mm per day.

[2022-12-17 15:14:27] <%Daniel_EU> on Twitch for example is 1$ per viewer per hour. So if you average 1k viewers your rate should be 1k per hour for a sponsorship at least
[2022-12-17 15:14:32] <brit_aus> Whats your plan with socials? Do u want to make a living off this?
[2022-12-17 15:14:35] <joedonegal> Well I worked for a company that paid pro gamer twitch streams

[2022-12-17 15:17:15] <%+Valientt> @Daniel_EU it really is, not going to discuss it in chat but you can DM me if you care, see plenty of people do it for years and get away with it

[2022-12-17 15:17:40] <MidnightSun28> Hi liz, hope your having a good day
[2022-12-17 15:17:43] <%CowboyAquatica> in general
[2022-12-17 15:17:47] <%Daniel_EU> exactly also Twitch always came with the "organic subs" arguments for streamers who wanted bigger cuts

[2022-12-17 15:18:11] <%+talldeanblinkx> sounds like california lol
[2022-12-17 15:18:13] <%Alasdair> can you imagine making 50k a month
[2022-12-17 15:18:22] <%CowboyAquatica> spent too much on twitch tbh
[2022-12-17 15:18:25] <%metasinGG> you've gotta be old to use a word like tact
[2022-12-17 15:18:29] <spencermackin> I feel relaxed when I hear your voice, Blink.
[2022-12-17 15:18:32] <mynameisjose34> I heard you're rich like pokimane that makes millions lol

[2022-12-17 15:18:48] <%syzurp1> You seem irritated
[2022-12-17 15:18:48] <%Alasdair> wtf is the young version of tact
[2022-12-17 15:18:49] <%+Valientt> this is why I think it's hilarious when people are like "I'm gonna start a platform where creators get a 90% split", that platform goes bust fast
[2022-12-17 15:18:50] <ryandom190> oh sorry to hear that
[2022-12-17 15:18:54] <JABO0N> pain cuz of twitch taxing 50%?

[2022-12-17 15:20:37] <%$watertiger2075> tact = adroitness and sensitivity in dealing with others or with difficult issues. "the inspector broke the news to me with tact and consideration"
