[2023-01-07 13:09:40] <%ItsDivination> Ya know, with how they gave Focused Shot a QoL change on the PTR, I'm surprised that the Deadeye's didn't get their SFR to be improved so it doesn't push them so far back they miss the last close back attack bonus for the last hit

[2023-01-07 13:12:51] <NathanWearsPants> my biggest issue is bash still existing, and the fact that this change probably means they won't touch it for a long time
[2023-01-07 13:13:01] <%+TheButteryGamer> and some of those that did, were just pvp nerfs, and its like who cares
[2023-01-07 13:13:09] <NathanWearsPants> the changes we got are some nice changes though

[2023-01-07 13:13:43] <%killuazan> since Artist is oficially announced on the west, a new set of reminders will be posted accordingly for all the AYAYAING enjoyers

[2023-01-07 13:14:20] <+nonax85> i prefer shooters or fighting games when it comes to pvp
[2023-01-07 13:14:22] <+JigglyPingu> whats that lightning aoe ?
[2023-01-07 13:14:29] <+CruxialG> maybe martial artist changes gonna come with male scrapper?
[2023-01-07 13:14:35] <yoppii70> @JigglyPingu betrayal set
[2023-01-07 13:14:46] <CocoChanel_> i actally kinda like blue gl change, less dmg for others with taunt, doing a bit more dmg yourself and u can still give more dmg to others with identity skill (more uptime for others and no longer only a downside for self by using it)
[2023-01-07 13:14:48] <+MeSaikou> that is basically going to be there MMO no?

[2023-01-07 14:38:39] <%+Condyxo> @snazlbc bro you have a very biased opinion on this because of 1 interaction
[2023-01-07 14:38:40] <einekleine76> @munamanne Im pretty sure you can buff them after cast. Example is igniter, pressing doomsday first before Igniting

[2023-01-07 14:42:30] <!%LustKR> usually my take is stagger/weak point gatekeeping is reasonable and ilvl/title gatekeeping are pointless
[2023-01-07 14:42:31] <+ReletingOak0> gatekeeping is not a zero thing, that there is a good thing or a bad thing
[2023-01-07 14:42:31] <Savii_chan> @ATK  so demonic and scouter is el cheapo class with 2 gems but arti with 1 lvl 10dmg gem and rest can be lvl 7 easily while always mvp but we demonics have no way to even show up on family photo if not for counter/stagger

[2023-01-07 15:50:22] <RobotPlayer> Rather have a more diverse engraving pool rather then needing the current engravings- so make either more engravings or change current engravings to be viable

[2023-01-07 17:52:09] <+GodSlim7> supports join juicere lobbies not average ones typically so it wont change really
[2023-01-07 17:52:12] <@%+Shikiro> I think I'm gonna be switching to 2 supports when artist comes out. But that support will probably be reserved to a static KEKW
[2023-01-07 17:52:18] <Canidae5> the support shortage is worst at the brel g5/6 range
[2023-01-07 17:52:25] <%theresa_flutura> I think it will help for Valtan and Vykas and maybe Kakul but not higher than that

[2023-01-07 18:13:46] <Munnes> I guess they can only touch like 1-2 class in terms of qol per balance update
[2023-01-07 18:13:51] <Houtsu> control tho KEKW
[2023-01-07 18:13:52] <Munnes> like zerker and scouter got QOL
[2023-01-07 18:13:59] <Munnes> and bard
[2023-01-07 18:14:15] <sheikh_joy> @sheikh_joy oh yes 4% i forgot
[2023-01-07 18:14:16] <Munnes> AT scouter got a lot of qol and love
[2023-01-07 18:14:24] <Munnes> I fucking love it

[2023-01-07 18:14:27] <+el2457> probably you can fit 5 skills in mayhem red dest
[2023-01-07 18:14:35] <Munnes> baby drone also does not spread
[2023-01-07 18:14:38] <+el2457> and not use counter at 10
[2023-01-07 18:14:39] <Munnes> for AT
[2023-01-07 18:14:40] <yoromichi> raid missile mean the ult?
[2023-01-07 18:14:42] <Xtra_Step> @ATK does the "normal skill" buff applies to sync? seen different answers

[2023-01-07 18:14:58] <+TheRealBojangle> @Xtra_Step no it means yellow skills
[2023-01-07 18:15:08] <Munnes> AT scouter enjoyers stonks went up
[2023-01-07 18:15:10] <Munnes> GIGACHAD
[2023-01-07 18:15:36] <Munnes> 3-3-2 build might be better now for AT, but I dont wanna rebuild till ancient
[2023-01-07 18:15:37] <+TheRealBojangle> @Munnes AT still needs work
[2023-01-07 18:15:38] <+TaaviXIV> They should give Lancemaster's base animations WAY FASTER animations, get rid of the attackspeed boost in blue stance and replace it with movementspeed boost so we can fully utilize raid captain. That would be the proper way to go in my opinion. Or make it so LM can fully utilize Super Charge or All out Attack.
[2023-01-07 18:15:47] <%yoohyeonisn> Yellow is 일반 category so i guess so
[2023-01-07 18:15:54] <+TheRealBojangle> Battery is still an issue
[2023-01-07 18:15:56] <Munnes> @TheRealBojangle it's enough in my book
[2023-01-07 18:16:02] <+TheRealBojangle> you still get punished for having high uptime

[2023-01-07 18:16:52] <+TheRealBojangle> they need to either reduce battery usage on skill or buff how fast battery recharges

[2023-01-07 18:17:07] <+TheRealBojangle> @deadlypants112 it does, but its a lame bandaid to an inherent problem with the class
[2023-01-07 18:17:20] <Xtra_Step> what set does AT uses? hallu?

[2023-01-07 18:17:36] <%+deadlypants112> depends on stats u use
[2023-01-07 18:17:52] <+diceGGG> feels like shadow hunters and scouters might as well delete their class
[2023-01-07 18:18:02] <%yoohyeonisn> Scrapper nerfed with synergy nerf
[2023-01-07 18:18:06] <%yoohyeonisn> That’s it
[2023-01-07 18:18:21] <BjornBearTV> So are SS dead? Or atleast DeathStrike?
[2023-01-07 18:18:30] <%yoohyeonisn> Deathstrike is dead
[2023-01-07 18:18:33] <%TekuMehku> increased damage but they got fked by synergy nerf too KEKL
[2023-01-07 18:18:35] <Munnes> PS cooldowns still suck for rotation and still same mana issues
[2023-01-07 18:18:39] <%yoohyeonisn> And double engraving is extra dead
[2023-01-07 18:18:42] <Munnes> and lvl3 engraving is meh too
[2023-01-07 18:18:46] <%lostsoulz1010> the dmg buffs are just to make up for synergy nerfs basically
[2023-01-07 18:18:48] <sta1os> Perfect Suppression has a big problem with mobility
[2023-01-07 18:18:49] <+TheRealBojangle> AT Scouter and PS Shadowhunter overall got like a 4% damage boost. totally lame
[2023-01-07 18:18:54] VIEWERS: 993
[2023-01-07 18:19:02] <Andore97> can you explain why its dead?
[2023-01-07 18:19:20] <+TheRealBojangle> safe and lazy
[2023-01-07 18:19:20] <Munnes> we need what zerker got
[2023-01-07 18:19:23] <Munnes> for every class
[2023-01-07 18:19:29] <Munnes> I get that it requires a lot of work
[2023-01-07 18:19:30] <%yoohyeonisn> Mainly due to silvermaster rework
[2023-01-07 18:19:38] <%+HellEtFendROz> they should tripod on trnsfo class and more gem to use
[2023-01-07 18:19:41] <%yoohyeonisn> And it’s still clunky as fuck
[2023-01-07 18:19:42] <sta1os> Number changes is very lazy
[2023-01-07 18:19:48] <%yoohyeonisn> And mana issues is still a problem
[2023-01-07 18:19:51] <+TheRealBojangle> to be fair, when they try ambitious like what they tried with Soulfist....the community flipped out on them LOL
[2023-01-07 18:20:02] <BjornBearTV> Rip my 1540 DS SS

[2023-01-07 18:20:37] <Munnes> @BjornBearTV just hope they fix it by the end of balance patch
[2023-01-07 18:20:39] <Munnes> i pray for u
[2023-01-07 18:20:47] <%yoohyeonisn> LC is good though
[2023-01-07 18:20:55] <Xtra_Step> with the backlash, how likely it is they change on the sharshooter rework?

[2023-01-07 18:21:25] <+TaaviXIV> Arcana was a bit too succesful in my opinion
[2023-01-07 18:21:25] <yoromichi> number changes make it look like just a bandage on the cut not the actual treatment
[2023-01-07 18:21:34] <BjornBearTV> @munnes thanks! Probably gonna put it in Lopang and play pistoleer isnetad lol

[2023-01-07 19:08:38] <+TheRealBojangle> @bakanoasobi its been a pattern. the class they reworked ends up being bad/underwhelming on PTR. and it comes out strong asf on live.
[2023-01-07 19:08:55] <krosis_666> So with this changes to the zerk and the male scrapper already anounced we can say the scrapper is gonna have a rework in the future?
[2023-01-07 19:09:01] <+TheRealBojangle> if SS breaks that trend....then theres not hope for the class LOL

[2023-01-07 19:50:12] <mist4cray> @felony212 there's no better options, just test some stuff and find a class u like. Tho i'd recommend scrapper for a new player, quite nice to play, not too fragile

[2023-01-07 19:52:19] <mist4cray> @felony212 they are fragile, they can die one shot
[2023-01-07 19:52:26] <orange_power> easy to die on @felony212
[2023-01-07 19:52:33] <+TaaviXIV> Very fragile and the reward is rather low for they risk you're taking unlike other classes

[2023-01-07 19:53:53] <hollowsentry> no one is gonna play blue after the changes. absolutely no reason to
[2023-01-07 19:53:54] <felony212> So then my biggest bet is getting a martial artist class?
[2023-01-07 19:54:05] <felony212> cause i dont like mages
[2023-01-07 19:54:08] <%+weirdflavour> @weirdflavour yh but a shit counter xD
[2023-01-07 19:54:22] <mist4cray> @felony212 again, just test the classes, if you like reaper, do reaper
[2023-01-07 19:54:27] <+TaaviXIV> Play WHATEVER YOU LIKE but some jobs have caveats to them which may hinder your gameplay experience
[2023-01-07 19:54:48] <felony212> @felony212 no point taking reaper if im not gonna be able to progress with me being gatekept
[2023-01-07 19:54:51] <+TaaviXIV> dont let anyone tell you what you gonna play, I'm just a twitch chatter giving you my opinion
[2023-01-07 19:55:08] <+TaaviXIV> You'll get accepted eventually, but its gonna be rather annoying to find parties

[2023-01-07 20:30:11] <+S5un> I think red will allow faster push in the windows where everyone wants to push mechs.
[2023-01-07 20:30:23] <+S5un> Whereas blue is just consistently gonna be slapping the boss.
[2023-01-07 20:30:50] <+S5un> at the end of the fight they’re probably going to be somewhat similar on a lot of instances with variance depending on the player and raid.

[2023-01-07 20:33:41] <+S5un> Exactly, GL overall isn’t a damage class 😅. If you want to do damage play a real damage class. Red and blue are both gigachads.
[2023-01-07 20:33:43] <+IrvingRhames> blues might get gatekept now with the synergy changes
[2023-01-07 20:33:53] <hollowsentry> @Sluin he didn't though. his negative damage got a 3% buff while lowering the damage he offers the party by millions
[2023-01-07 20:33:54] <+S5un> ATK said it right…you play GL for gigachad life.
[2023-01-07 20:33:59] <crushler> can u play a little bit berserker i heard he got skill animation changes
[2023-01-07 20:33:59] <+IrvingRhames> seems like another high dps class would always be preferable
[2023-01-07 20:34:29] <+Funkyy_Sloth> blue can also dps nearly bin Stop. where red maybe needs to wait for positioning. so for Bosses that allow constant dmg blue should be better
[2023-01-07 20:35:06] <+S5un> Blue and red = gigachads. But raid parties are gonna give us the side eye cause they lost 3% synergy damage 😬.

[2023-01-07 20:36:27] <sta1os> so its still desirable. Just less so

[2023-01-07 20:36:53] <+S5un> I’ve seen Mustang Kim play precise dagger over adrenaline. Is that a popular option in KR?
[2023-01-07 20:36:58] <+Azrebalmung> shouldnt GL be more desireable now that SoH benefits non-entropy classes more?
[2023-01-07 20:37:31] <Sluin> @Sluin I guess you're right, in perfect party set up he loses some, in party with hitmasters he will be a little better then before

[2023-01-07 20:38:08] <sta1os> entropy users doesn't always get gunlancers but, gunlancers usually does get paired with entropy

[2023-01-07 20:38:56] <spiritdragon756> For some entropy classes DB + Crit synergy DPS can be better

[2023-01-07 20:40:55] <+S5un> That’s a fair assessment. Thanks for going back and analyzing further though. Stay gigachad ATK 🤝🏻.
[2023-01-07 20:41:15] <sta1os> battlefield shield is clutch, but niche and the damage that they added to it isn't consequential

[2023-01-07 20:44:14] <Sluin> @sta1os damage itself maybe, but it gives your party push immunity, they can keep dpsing through hard patterns on top of that damage you do
[2023-01-07 20:44:45] <Sluin> also cancel and not being out of shield afters sounds great

[2023-01-07 20:48:03] <%+ewey59> if they added the synergy to nella, that would give GL another skill slot

[2023-01-07 20:56:17] <+pparadiise> i mean red gl got a nice buff thought no ?
[2023-01-07 20:56:26] <spiritdragon756> Not only you need to do a lot of Damage, the synergy is not that promising
[2023-01-07 20:56:34] <+moosebruiser1> @pparadiise not really a buff, kind of like a side grade
[2023-01-07 20:56:40] <+ArgentWithAnR> prepare for another fun paint job
[2023-01-07 20:56:40] <aznkayle> the main purpose was probably the shield meter, and then they were like oh hey synergy here
