[2023-01-10 09:05:46] <%Lakart> @Richard_Hammer Does it count as sucking at fishing if their primary objective was always just to get drunk in the woods?
[2023-01-10 09:05:56] VIEWERS: 45
[2023-01-10 09:06:03] <%Lakart> Woods have rivers
[2023-01-10 09:06:04] <%Lakart> shhh
[2023-01-10 09:06:36] <%Lakart> Nah see if I get off the river and I'm in the middle of bufu that still counts as being in the woods
[2023-01-10 09:06:39] <%DannyLockard> my dad has a pond that he stocks, sometimes its just a bad day for fishin
[2023-01-10 09:06:44] <%+Cynder_Dragon> Those were deer, not fish, Lakart.
[2023-01-10 09:06:56] <%Lakart> @Cynder_Dragon If the deer bite my hook that's their own fault
[2023-01-10 09:07:13] <%+K9kroz> Thanks for the pegging and fishing at the same time. Has been a dream of mine for a while :)
[2023-01-10 09:07:24] <%DannyLockard> lol fair
[2023-01-10 09:07:28] <%+badjuju518> @lakart graphics are a little rough though

[2023-01-10 09:08:04] <%+K9kroz> @Richard_Hammer do you have any titanium sinkers?

[2023-01-10 09:08:52] <!%Calastigro> tungsten fishing weights are one of the cheaper ways to get a chunk of tungsten, if you're in the market
[2023-01-10 09:09:03] <%+K9kroz> true
[2023-01-10 09:09:04] <%$kuakae> speaking of tungsten, did you hear about those amazing tungsten cubes? they are a bit expensive but worth every cent
[2023-01-10 09:09:20] <%+K9kroz> LUL
[2023-01-10 09:09:34] <!%Calastigro> yeah the tungsten cube market is a racket

[2023-01-10 09:10:14] <%Lakart> Yea basically shortly before winter
[2023-01-10 09:10:24] <%+K9kroz> @Richard_Hammer do you ever surf fish?
[2023-01-10 09:10:47] <%$kuakae> he is totally gonna put a snapping lizard down your pants
[2023-01-10 09:10:55] <%Lakart> The biggest effect hurricane season had on me last year was it stole my god damn outdoor contractor for cleanup work for a month
[2023-01-10 09:11:10] <%+K9kroz> i did it for the first time.. was scary.. i thought the bait would attract sharks. the old guy with us said he had been doing it for 60 yrs and never been bit
[2023-01-10 09:11:31] <%+K9kroz> flawless logic

[2023-01-10 09:12:31] <%Lakart> All these fucking communities that don't allow through roads make the driving cancerous
[2023-01-10 09:12:41] <%+K9kroz> true.. the plane ride to NC was probably more dangerous than the sharks
[2023-01-10 09:12:45] <%thexLed> Good morning
[2023-01-10 09:12:56] <%+K9kroz> statistically
[2023-01-10 09:13:34] <%+K9kroz> is it advantageous to fish in the rain IRL? @Richard_Hammer
[2023-01-10 09:13:47] <%Lakart> My street goes right to a big arterial roadway that's always solid traffic during any busy time of the day because every street other than mine on said road is a community that you can't drive through, only into, and on the other side is a lake.
[2023-01-10 09:14:00] VIEWERS: 75
[2023-01-10 09:14:23] <%+K9kroz> does this game reflect that properly?
[2023-01-10 09:14:25] <%thexLed> Pike fishing over here is always amazing just after a thunderstorm
[2023-01-10 09:14:52] <%+K9kroz> carbon fiber and tungsten in lightning storms seems terrible
[2023-01-10 09:15:58] <%+badjuju518> so far both times I've come up to fish with you theres been storms when there wasn't supposed to be

Would you have ever entertained a thought of joining a more casual 7 character race on something like GDQ back in the day, just to showcase it?

[2023-01-10 12:25:59] <%+badjuju518> we that's what the captain said was 200lb about 7ft
[2023-01-10 12:26:16] <benispettigrew1> That sounds pretty safe, you just have to avoid boats right? Sharks are not dangerous to humans, they're dangers to seals
[2023-01-10 12:26:16] <%Nanometroid> That has the potential that I'm the bait, and that's not cool.
[2023-01-10 12:26:26] <+dpdicken> yeah we did that too once lol, we saw someone catch maybe a 7 foot hammer head off the beach once using that method
[2023-01-10 12:26:29] <%$kuakae> are they explicitly forbidden or could it be an airbud scenario?

[2023-01-10 12:32:20] <benispettigrew1> It was a real catch, I didn't do it all myself I was with a tour group and the guides set up the bait and and everthing, not trolling on this one

[2023-01-10 12:35:38] <%thexLed> dunno about that, we have like two different types of trout over here, and they are both pink in their meat
[2023-01-10 12:35:45] <%thexLed> and they are delicious af
[2023-01-10 12:35:52] <%+Razzels_tv> Trout depends.. they are very boney. In washington they do alot of truck trout and they can taste like dirt.
[2023-01-10 12:35:54] <%+badjuju518> it's pretty big on Lake Erie
[2023-01-10 12:36:00] <%+Razzels_tv> Rainbows and brook trout are quite good tho

[2023-01-10 12:48:25] <%Lakart> That's only an issue in the everglades national parks, they fail to spread anywhere with actual people
[2023-01-10 12:48:52] <%Lakart> It's really the small shit that spreads like wildfire, like the cuban anole species and frogs.
[2023-01-10 12:49:17] <%Lakart> Temps + environment, large snakes do not do well in anything resembling an urban environment so anywhere people have replaced trees with parking lots big snakes can fuck right off.
