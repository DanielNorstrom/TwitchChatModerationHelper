[2022-12-08 01:17:57] <%Rennekai> @QatriJon It doesn't necessarily have a specific meaning, just more or less a French Symbol of importance.
[2022-12-08 01:18:08] <RYETWO> Suarez can fucking drive.
[2022-12-08 01:18:08] <%typicaldrew719> Saints are trash.

Fucking game infuriates me to no end but I love it beyond any other game. I imagine I’ll be able to one shot the final dragon when the time comes if that’s who the boss is.

[2022-12-08 21:36:12] <%$miIIer_> twitch turbo is the way to go, no ads but the streamer still gets the ad rev as if you had to watch the ads
[2022-12-08 21:36:12] <%+skinnay11> Them putting ads on twitch prime is bullshit

[2022-12-08 21:36:30] <+outlaw_militia_gaming> i love turbo! though you dont get emotes but you could still sub if you want to support or get lucky with a gited sub from soneone but turbo works for everyone stream so no ads anywhere. but it also counts for the streamers ad rev too though so everone wins
[2022-12-08 21:36:33] <Dr_Eric> @skinnay11 True
[2022-12-08 21:36:36] <+hennybones> @skinnay11 They’re doing that?
[2022-12-08 21:36:54] <+ikonicgaming_> just all depends how you value your time on twitch.... I hop channels alot and those ads add up to a lot of time.
[2022-12-08 21:37:01] <+concur89> how do u get twitch turbo
[2022-12-08 21:37:01] <+Mahbody> @skinnay11 you mean subbing with twitch prime?
[2022-12-08 21:37:06] <+DanLGG> Turbo is like being subbed to every system you watch and I watch $10 a month worth of streams
[2022-12-08 21:37:08] <+DoubleCup_Dan> @skinnay11 if you get ads on prime it is prob bc you have an adblocker, for some reason

[2022-12-08 21:40:05] <+BeniiWade> chat is confused because it used to be if you have prime you dont gets ads period, now its you dont gets ads only on whoever you use the prime sub on
[2022-12-08 21:40:07] <DewbieFTW> sub = no ads, just having prime still gives you ads - gotta sub
[2022-12-08 21:40:11] <%+mannydahman> If you have prime you gets ads unless you sub he complaining saying why not make having prime an ad blocker basically without having to sub
[2022-12-08 21:40:13] <%+TrackvinGaming> if you have prime and your not sub u get ads
[2022-12-08 21:40:13] <+kashew201> not True @IceDude62
[2022-12-08 21:40:17] <+TheSavageCoder> Twitch Turbo to avoid viewing ads. $$ donations if you want your $ to actually go to the streamer.

[2022-12-08 21:42:25] <%+eventhorizon___> TRUE, WHICH IS WHY YOU SHOULD DROP A SUB TO MY BOY HUTCH FOR BEING HONEST.
[2022-12-08 21:42:27] <%chibinanu> i would get turbo but i dont watch twitch that much anymore
[2022-12-08 21:42:27] <%+ftejeda23> I sub to @HutchMF because it is donating to the disabled due to him having No Nipples LUL
[2022-12-08 21:42:32] <%+Bunnell> turbo helps the streamer with adds still
[2022-12-08 21:42:32] <%mmajeter2> Anyone know if it works on mobile?
[2022-12-08 21:42:36] <%+tuurgan_14> it's like paying for netflix
[2022-12-08 21:42:37] <+Keuelin2> for me twitch in unwatchable without turbo
[2022-12-08 21:42:38] <+PicklemanJaro> the streamer still gets ad revenue from turbo users
[2022-12-08 21:42:38] <Dr_Eric> @hutchmf do you still get ad money when we have turbo?
[2022-12-08 21:42:43] <+TheNewVirus_> its crazy, ive been watching twitch for years and ive never seen people complain and try to get around ads as much as this last year. borderline annoying af LUL
[2022-12-08 21:42:43] <kismahas> Prime was the way at the time until they introduced turbo what a scam LUL
[2022-12-08 21:42:43] <+DanielTy88> Turbo is 8.99 a month
[2022-12-08 21:42:43] <%GrimSkallTV> its not 6 its 9
[2022-12-08 21:42:46] <+ZomBeastMode> The streamer gets credit for the ads if you have Turbo.....EZ....read the text
[2022-12-08 21:42:49] <+DanielTy88> sumE
[2022-12-08 21:42:51] <+wulftrn> turbo works on mobile
[2022-12-08 21:42:52] <%ThySaltyOne> ide rather sub to the streamer im watching to get no subs then pay for turbo especially if u dont watch a bunch of channels
[2022-12-08 21:42:53] <Shatred69> If you wanna support hutch, you better send a direct dono instead of doing a useless sub
[2022-12-08 21:42:59] <+Mahbody> so i should donate then
[2022-12-08 21:42:59] <+Canadian2k> adblock+donate directly to streamer EZ Clap
[2022-12-08 21:42:59] <+wulftrn> I'm on mobile rn
[2022-12-08 21:42:59] <%ThySaltyOne> now if you do tubro is 100% worth it
[2022-12-08 21:42:59] <%aqinyourface> I'm super excited for trains streaming service to pop off
[2022-12-08 21:43:03] <%+Themaddhatter19> buy turbo then spam prime on hutch every month
[2022-12-08 21:43:04] <+IronsFanDan> Twitch Turbo still gives streamer ad revenue
[2022-12-08 21:43:05] <+Bithed> streamers get paid the same if viewers have turbo
[2022-12-08 21:43:06] <Narcotical> The ad revenue is less than a sub though I imagine
[2022-12-08 21:43:06] <%+VanIsland63> he still gets paid for the ads you dont see with turbo i believe
[2022-12-08 21:43:07] <%+eventhorizon___> THE PRICE IS IRRELEVANT LUL
[2022-12-08 21:43:10] <+jimmy216> <3 <3 <3 <3
[2022-12-08 21:43:10] <+Bithed> it's a win win
[2022-12-08 21:43:13] <%theisis_> ..
[2022-12-08 21:43:14] <+d41mon> Just use Firefox and any adblock for no ads if you are so bothered about the ads
[2022-12-08 21:43:20] <%+skinnay11> @doublecup_dan I get ads on prime for channels I’m not a sub for. Happens on mobile and pc
[2022-12-08 21:43:27] <+jimmy216> @ironsfandan agreed
[2022-12-08 21:43:30] <%+childs_plays> think about all the money twitch makes... with all the streamers.. kinda crazy

[2022-12-08 21:44:03] <%+ftejeda23> that makes no sense
[2022-12-08 21:44:03] <%ThySaltyOne> the reducing the cut payed to streamers blows me away to tbh lol
[2022-12-08 21:44:03] <+superspaz4> lmao i call bullshit on that!
[2022-12-08 21:44:06] <+jimmy216> run those ads
[2022-12-08 21:44:06] <%chibinanu> its true, amazon is a small company
[2022-12-08 21:44:09] <Shatred69> twitch... struggling? KEKW
[2022-12-08 21:44:16] <%+Themaddhatter19> not enough to keep the same cut had to go to 50 50
[2022-12-08 21:44:17] <%defiantal> Twitch does have incompetent management tho.
[2022-12-08 21:44:19] <+DanielTy88> TO avoid taxes
[2022-12-08 21:44:19] <Shatred69> Bezos poor? KEKW
[2022-12-08 21:44:23] <GotchaRexi> ya if they make profit they have to pay more taxes lol
[2022-12-08 21:44:25] <+dorschfordkiatv> "We dont make profit" *HAnds out mega bonuses*
[2022-12-08 21:44:27] <%+eventhorizon___> PROBABLY TRUE, BECUASE THE EXEWCUTIVES TAKE THE PROFIT TO THEIR BANK ACCOUNTS KEKW
[2022-12-08 21:44:27] <%Wootloops> twitch does not make that much
[2022-12-08 21:44:32] <Dr_Eric> The make sure they don’t
[2022-12-08 21:44:35] <tiltsalot> it costs nike 8 bucks to make a 140$ pair of shoes if you're not turning profit that's on you sumLUL
[2022-12-08 21:44:35] <+superspaz4> lmao amazon is making money on my prime without giving me 2-day shipping now haha
[2022-12-08 21:44:37] <+jimlay123> if they claimed they made profits, they would have to pay major taxes
[2022-12-08 21:44:38] <+IronboundFate> Well you have to think about it this way, twitch prime subs come straight out of Amazons backing.
[2022-12-08 21:44:40] <sinfyx_> @HutchMF  sell based on Market Value not on what the Books show
[2022-12-08 21:44:43] <%+mannydahman> They just pay ppl alot of money to not pay taxes lol
[2022-12-08 21:44:55] <+Mahbody> @HutchMF look at how twitter was ran they had way to many employees for the product they were giving
[2022-12-08 21:44:55] <%NivekFPS> because Profit is taxable. if you "break even" or negative you are liable for taxes
[2022-12-08 21:44:55] <Narcotical> @BriggzIsBiz Sure, but that is because a lot of people are watching these ads. If you look at what revenue 1 person watching ads will bring in that surely is lower than 1 sub every month
[2022-12-08 21:44:58] <+Mahbody> same shit
[2022-12-08 21:45:01] <GotchaRexi> @superspaz4 I just saw there is apparently a class action lawsuit about this

[2022-12-08 21:45:09] <+ZomBeastMode> Twitch pays AWS a shitload of money, which is just shuffling money around Amazon....that is how they say they aren't making money.

[2022-12-08 21:45:50] <+superspaz4> @GotchaRexi good! haha thats legit the only reason i pay $140 a year for it
[2022-12-08 21:45:52] <+jimmy216> that's crazy to me
[2022-12-08 21:45:59] <%+quantummayor> @pluto ya heard this
[2022-12-08 21:46:00] <WH1ZZ3R> Twitch generated approximately $2.6 billion revenue in 2021, a 41% year-on-year increase. According to google. take it with a pinch of salt i guess XD
[2022-12-08 21:46:05] <+BriggzIsBiz> @Narcotical thats true im sure. but not everyone can afford $5 a month to every streamer they watch. but can afford turbo and still give ad revenue without watching ads is the point of it

[2022-12-08 21:47:03] <Narcotical> @BriggzIsBiz Oh yeah I get watch Hutch is trying to say for sure. Just saying people would rather sub than get Turbo because the streamer they like would benefit more, especially if they only watch like a handful streamer on the regular
