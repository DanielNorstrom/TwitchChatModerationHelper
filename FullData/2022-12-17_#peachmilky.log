[2022-12-17 03:19:35] <$AkameOda> There's a guy who's lived in JP 8 years. Still doesn't know. KEKW
[2022-12-17 03:19:36] <Bais___> @stratahawk Hey
[2022-12-17 03:20:02] <inari__san> Does the guy have Japanese friends?
[2022-12-17 03:20:12] <gearz_twitch> u can name him after his archon quests, and you get a sheet of paper with which you can rename him any time (sry misspelled smth just now)
[2022-12-17 03:20:16] <$AkameOda> As much as you, & we mock him for it. LUL
[2022-12-17 03:20:20] <gearz_twitch> duolingo?
[2022-12-17 03:20:36] <$AkameOda> @inari__san He does have people help him
[2022-12-17 03:20:37] <inari__san> True, consistency is important.
