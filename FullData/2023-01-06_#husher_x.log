[2023-01-06 08:02:31] <McDominate> you just gotta get out of your head, i feel like you keep trying to 'rein yourself in' when you are making degen jokes or being goofy, and you are accidentally squashing your own energy

[2023-01-06 08:02:44] <@%AslanGrants> Honestly tho, I think the best piercings're naval or belly button piercings. And as fun as nipple piercings look, I don't think I'd very much enjoy them on my partner.

[2023-01-06 08:03:18] <@%$Kris18_TF2> I agree on ear piercings being best as well. Naval is acceptable, but I don't really care for much else. Nipple piercings are a giant turnoff for me.

[2023-01-06 12:01:47] <McDominate> if you want, you can set up a noise compressor on your mic, it will make it to where if the mic ever outputs over a certain noise level, it will automatically lower the volume to a preset max
