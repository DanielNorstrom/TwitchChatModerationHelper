[2022-12-09 00:22:57] <privatebagon> This gargoyle was the most difficult boss in my first playthrough... a complete nightmare
[2022-12-09 00:23:00] <NNimri> You dont have to kill this guy now  - part of his storyline is you just need to hit him a couple of times to subdue him
[2022-12-09 00:23:02] <+TuckerLeigh> Beastial sanctum, head south east cross the bridge to the grace by the tower, up the wind lift, up the next wind lift on the other side of the big tree

[2022-12-09 00:24:26] <NNimri> caelid the part you don't have the map to under the erdtree in caelid is the dragonbarow
[2022-12-09 00:24:31] <%$shplonkey_donkey> Just wanna say, stream is great man keep it up. Thanks for all
[2022-12-09 00:24:41] <%marcyyoma> @eggsboot then you must stand more
[2022-12-09 00:24:49] <%$swoopbandy> this is a shit cave
[2022-12-09 00:24:57] <%$CharlesZane> @Abe_Armstrong I could understand moving around. But standing in one place is misery for me.
[2022-12-09 00:25:11] <+eggsboot> @marcyyoma I was kidding but yes
[2022-12-09 00:25:18] <+Cohaay> Bug boys aren't much more fun than what you'll find in Cailed
[2022-12-09 00:25:19] <+eggsboot> Standing is good
[2022-12-09 00:25:19] <%final_chance_> The trap chest warps you here
[2022-12-09 00:25:38] <%Venomchris> I hope they announce a some good shit at the game awards
[2022-12-09 00:25:50] <+Casavilla458> even the Forbidden Woods being tricky in my mind I still know how to start there and get to Bergen  without a problem
[2022-12-09 00:25:50] <+eggsboot> I too, hope that
[2022-12-09 00:25:50] <%SilverWind19C> back in ma days them trap chests were called mimics! heyzeusRNGzeus
[2022-12-09 00:25:53] <NNimri> Why don't you activate a rune and use a rune arc?
[2022-12-09 00:25:56] <$Abe_Armstrong> @Abe_Armstrong Oh I'm the same actually, motion is lotion! My feet will get sore standing in one space, or I'll lock my knees and pass out
[2022-12-09 00:26:09] <%+Minmatar0> I want Metroid Prime 4 gameplay.
[2022-12-09 00:26:09] <%+hotdogeatingcoach> feel dumb asking but where can you watch online for free?

[2022-12-09 00:26:36] [Notification] jabroneydingus subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! [My lucky day, home from work and the blood God is still at it]
[2022-12-09 00:26:38] <+eggsboot> @hotdogeatingcoach isn’t Zeus streaming it
[2022-12-09 00:26:52] <NNimri> depends on the rune you activate  - runes that are dropped from bosses
[2022-12-09 00:27:03] <NNimri> main bosses
[2022-12-09 00:27:04] <urnansflipflop69_> on what time is the award ?
[2022-12-09 00:27:07] <%final_chance_> Godrick Rune gives +5 all stats when activated
[2022-12-09 00:27:11] <+PrimeSoulSpecter> Yeah those shrimp enemies are annoying
[2022-12-09 00:27:11] <7ckingmad_bw> 1 hour left?
[2022-12-09 00:27:13] <+eggsboot> Hopefully Elden ring dlc announcement
[2022-12-09 00:27:14] <%+Minmatar0> you sit at the grace and set a rune. the one godric gave you gives you +5 to all stats
[2022-12-09 00:27:15] <%+magusthefiend> roachwizards
[2022-12-09 00:27:16] <%$CharlesZane> yep
[2022-12-09 00:27:17] <CloakedSage> yes
[2022-12-09 00:27:17] <+Casavilla458> yes
[2022-12-09 00:27:19] <privatebagon> yes
[2022-12-09 00:27:23] <%+Minmatar0> Yes its like a ember in DS3
[2022-12-09 00:27:25] <%$ShadowWind825> Imagine it's an ember
[2022-12-09 00:27:30] <NNimri> rune arc goes away yes but use another one to activate
[2022-12-09 00:27:35] <CloakedSage> * the effect goes away. not the great rune
[2022-12-09 00:27:47] <%marcyyoma> yes save them
[2022-12-09 00:27:52] <%+chaosemperordragoneote> if you wanna do DLC, I would save em
[2022-12-09 00:27:52] <%SchoonersOnTap> D:
[2022-12-09 00:27:58] <%final_chance_> Its Embering with additional benefits depending on what you pick
[2022-12-09 00:27:59] <%PeterThePickledPepper> how did radahn go?
[2022-12-09 00:27:59] <+Casavilla458> if I'm not mistaken you beat the game your first run without ever using any of them
[2022-12-09 00:28:06] <%$CharlesZane> It gives +5 to all attributes if you use Godrick's.
[2022-12-09 00:28:06] <%daddyshaggy12> @chaosemperordragoneote what dlc
[2022-12-09 00:28:10] <%shredder41> I think the boss here has something good. I don’t remember what though lol

[2022-12-09 00:28:18] <%+Minmatar0> You plan on dying a lot blood god?
[2022-12-09 00:28:21] <privatebagon> @Casavilla458 you're right
[2022-12-09 00:28:22] <7ckingmad_bw> Radahn s rune is the best

[2022-12-09 00:28:26] <%+chaosemperordragoneote> @daddyshaggy12 a potential DLC xD
[2022-12-09 00:28:29] <%Jay7stone> You’re on right path
[2022-12-09 00:28:33] <%Woweeez> Did he finish the volcano manor?
[2022-12-09 00:28:36] <+eggsboot> An inevitable dlc
[2022-12-09 00:28:39] <%jabroneydingus> I saved all my rune arcs till the end of the game like a true dodo
[2022-12-09 00:28:40] <%daddyshaggy12> I just farted
[2022-12-09 00:28:42] <%lordkeeler> you can activate the shards you have
[2022-12-09 00:28:44] <NNimri> you cant use them without activating the great runes to begin with - Godrick's Great Rune gives you 5+ on all stats
[2022-12-09 00:28:50] <%SilverWind19C> increases HP, stamina and mind
[2022-12-09 00:28:56] <%+chaosemperordragoneote> 10% in hp, stamina and mind
[2022-12-09 00:29:04] <%marcyyoma> it's crazy I didn't use runes when I beat the game but I hear they can be helpful
[2022-12-09 00:29:18] <%or_somesay_Kosm> The great runes were a potentially better / more varied version of ember from DS3 but didn’t end up really being as useful as they could have been
[2022-12-09 00:29:25] <%lordkeeler> he has three so far
[2022-12-09 00:29:27] <NNimri> Godrick's Great Rune gives you 5+ on all stats - iss the best
[2022-12-09 00:29:30] <+eggsboot> Any games you’re anticipated for Zeus
[2022-12-09 00:29:33] <houssodheim> Malenia's rune is the rally mechanic @heyZeusHeresToast
[2022-12-09 00:29:34] <7ckingmad_bw> Godrick increases only health
[2022-12-09 00:29:36] <%lordkeeler> godrick
[2022-12-09 00:29:37] <7ckingmad_bw> ZZZZ
[2022-12-09 00:29:44] <%Jay7stone> The best is Godrick the t gives you 40 extra lvls
[2022-12-09 00:29:45] <%final_chance_> Godrick is best early on.+5 all stats. Falls off in lategame
[2022-12-09 00:29:46] <CloakedSage> get the shortcut firsrt

[2022-12-09 04:08:10] <%+Eccitaze_Graycloud> the music in GoW: Ragnarok was so forgettable, I literally don't remember a single song from the entire game

[2022-12-09 04:08:26] <%+qualiify> elden ring deserved it :(
[2022-12-09 04:08:27] <%lPredator_Godl> Elden Ring better win GoTY
[2022-12-09 04:08:27] <G__han> er not nominated is a scandal.
[2022-12-09 04:08:33] <%$1metalnation> It wasn't anything to write home about
[2022-12-09 04:08:33] <$supergreenjoker> i liked elden ring music
[2022-12-09 04:08:33] <%Cascio303> Battlestar Galactica baby!
[2022-12-09 04:08:34] <%+UnkleEnzo> He did the soundtrack for BSG which was amazing.
[2022-12-09 04:08:38] <dotw_iroh> It was good, but nowhere near as good as elden ring.
[2022-12-09 04:08:38] <%+KetsalEynon> did he just say Ethnic
[2022-12-09 04:08:39] <%DuosLeo000> I hate all of you.

[2022-12-09 04:08:41] <%Blog_12345> bro Elden Ring OST was amazing wtf
[2022-12-09 04:08:41] <%$akaWrecks> I would have been fine with Metal Hellsinger winning, but GoW was just... iterative and uninspired
[2022-12-09 04:08:42] <yharnam_sunrise105> he looks like tyr
[2022-12-09 04:08:48] <%Berkelear> Did you ever finish GoW tho Zeus?
[2022-12-09 04:08:49] <%retched95> bruh this shit is rigged
[2022-12-09 04:08:50] <%bugsbunny_xd> Hellsinger needed it
[2022-12-09 04:08:51] <%$1metalnation> but fuck me GOWR didn't have an *amazing* score
[2022-12-09 04:08:51] <%SilverWind19C> he made the soundtrack for godzilla 2, love this guy
[2022-12-09 04:08:59] <%$oigewan> ok, yeah.  that song was amazing.
[2022-12-09 04:09:00] <$meancat19> how much did they pay to win the award
[2022-12-09 04:09:01] <$Alithedude> every music in GOWR was literally like ooooo aaaa eeeee
[2022-12-09 04:09:01] <G__han> mcgreary is ok
[2022-12-09 04:09:01] <bc2acolyte> i think its safe to assume that ragnarok will get GOTY unfortunately.
[2022-12-09 04:09:04] <%+chapeldweller> Yeah either ER or Hellsinger should have got this
[2022-12-09 04:09:08] <needlessly_redundant> Kratos is clearly not a man of free words
[2022-12-09 04:09:12] <%vecci64> I’m convince Elden Ring isn’t gonna win GOTY now

[2022-12-09 04:09:21] <$supergreenjoker> elden ring music was epic
[2022-12-09 04:09:21] <7ckingmad_bw> Literally a Normie died on Grafted Scion and stopped playing, thats why he doesnt know about ER music

[2022-12-09 04:10:53] <+Solomonlike> Yeah it wouldn't shock me either at this point if GOW wins GOTY

[2022-12-09 14:44:22] <%$The_Grae_Pilgrim> I know @blog_12345 felt the same way
[2022-12-09 14:44:24] <%$DeadShotCynic> Ngl I'm kinda annoyed that Armoured Core 6 is the next game, a series they haven't done anything with since 2012. Miyazaki can't say he wants to focus on original IP's and not sequels but then return to an older series, personally I don't get it.
[2022-12-09 14:44:39] <%nwmn420> when did he say that?
[2022-12-09 14:44:39] <%+chapeldweller> @shinra441 Yerp. I was wondering who the hell he was while Miyazaki was talking

[2022-12-09 15:00:33] <swr3212> I remember getting to the end boss in Lord's of the Fallen. it was literally a completely different fight than anything else in the game.
[2022-12-09 15:00:34] <zzclipzz_h> In the trailer the scale looks huge
[2022-12-09 15:00:34] <%+DecayingReaver> very excited!!
[2022-12-09 15:00:37] <houssodheim> im so . excited for AC
[2022-12-09 15:00:40] <nephew69> Armored core let’s fucking goooooo
[2022-12-09 15:00:40] <%disraptor1> no exp.here
[2022-12-09 15:00:42] <%thewal1ofsleep> I'm not interested in AC or Mechs at all, but I'll try it because Fromsoft.
[2022-12-09 15:00:42] <%$CharlesZane> Looked cool, but I don't know what to expect.
[2022-12-09 15:00:42] <+BigPayback> @heyZeusHeresToast The reformed rabbi, Bill Clinton!
[2022-12-09 15:00:42] <%$The_Grae_Pilgrim> I don't know what kind of games they are...are they RPGs?
[2022-12-09 15:00:43] <%darkviking0420> Haven’t played AC in years, might be a nice change of pace
[2022-12-09 15:00:44] <%$Digitised> i watched gameplay pf AC5, i cant imagine how its going to work
[2022-12-09 15:00:47] <%+Saintandrews86> Im very excited
[2022-12-09 15:00:47] <%yuno_hoo> i'm definitely intrigued. is it going to be mech souls?
[2022-12-09 15:00:47] <%+Shrewbie44> Looks pretty sweet to me, but i've never played any AC games.
[2022-12-09 15:00:50] <mrchaosity98> i cant believe lords of the fallen was my first soulslike experience
[2022-12-09 15:00:54] <houssodheim> thats like a redcon i guess
[2022-12-09 15:00:55] <%+M4x182> I'm excited for gameplay, Miyazaki never disappoints
[2022-12-09 15:00:56] <%AFCYouri> Yooooo Zeus, the hype for Armored Core is real. I've never played 1 of the games but super interested in seeing what they'll do with it heyzeusHype
[2022-12-09 15:00:58] <%+shinra441> never touched AC, is it worth looking into the old ones
[2022-12-09 15:00:58] <%candercorn> wish it was Chromehounds 2, but it will be what it will be.
[2022-12-09 15:00:59] <klevas17> i have not seen anything about older AC games
[2022-12-09 15:01:06] <%Blog_12345> I trust in Miyazaki
[2022-12-09 15:01:12] <%marcyyoma> I love when an award show goes off the rails
[2022-12-09 15:01:13] <%+DarkAngelKain> I don’t know the armored core series what kind of gameplay is it?
[2022-12-09 15:01:14] <ingnora> so i am not hyped itslooks cool but that was just a cinematic
[2022-12-09 15:01:14] <%+higgs_89> my mother always gift armored core games when I was young so it's a franchise that I treasure
[2022-12-09 15:01:17] <%thewal1ofsleep> maybe they are hoping that everyone will forget about the original lords of the fallen since the new one will have the same name

[2022-12-09 15:01:24] <+DupinTM> Love the customization in AC. Hopefully its the dream of mecha pvp
[2022-12-09 15:01:31] <CountHedgehog> i wonder why they even named it lords of the fallen? if that has nothing to do with the first one, why name it the same as a giant flop of a game? doesn't make all that much sense
[2022-12-09 15:01:31] <%$Digitised> its nothing like a souls game, it focuses on co-op
[2022-12-09 15:01:32] <%Celestial_Lucid> What is AC?
[2022-12-09 15:01:33] <%ScarletNexuss> Miyazaki isn't the director this time
[2022-12-09 15:01:34] <pleepz_> Have you played any techland games like dying light
[2022-12-09 15:01:40] <drooper1337> Lotf 2 for the same reason we have dark souls 2

[2022-12-09 15:01:47] <dkia_97> Haven’t played any of the last games but I’m really curious to see what miyazaki does to the series. Since I know he simply can’t make bad video games 😂
[2022-12-09 15:01:48] <%darkviking0420> AC= Armored Core
[2022-12-09 15:01:48] <+genpinguim> The theme sounds interesting, but the complexity will not be different than anything that we ever seen; will launch for old gen
[2022-12-09 15:01:49] <Wendy_of_thepinkhair> i'm not disappointed but i didn't understand anything about gameplay, so i'm not hyped yet. is it souls like but with a robot?
[2022-12-09 15:01:59] <%SilverWind19C> 3rd person mecha game with fromsoft gameplay sounds awesome

[2022-12-09 15:09:16] <Wendy_of_thepinkhair> it's like you said zeus, coming from people who doesn't know what narrative means. so it's good
[2022-12-09 15:09:22] <%Knives112> and his fantastic 8 minute speech

[2022-12-09 15:12:10] <dkia_97> Can we have a spotify playlist or something like that for the stream songs ? As a synthwave maniac I love them all 🥺
[2022-12-09 15:12:11] <jimbo18_jr> Well like I said the highlight was muppet dress lady
[2022-12-09 15:12:17] <%candercorn> @mitchp1983 - is asking about the coliseum dlc going to become the next  mutable / bannable channel trend?
[2022-12-09 15:12:21] <%$justin6ix9> I’d wholeheartedly agree that Elden Ring was the best overall game of 2022 and God of War Ragnarok was second best
[2022-12-09 15:12:21] <tbprimeminister> it was so bad. Did you notice how few people there were in the audience too? I was shocked about that based on how much money they spent
[2022-12-09 15:12:26] <%$CharlesZane> And the muppet dress
[2022-12-09 15:12:28] <%frank_mourningtree> Death Stranding 2
[2022-12-09 15:12:37] <%Blog_12345> let's not forget the Muppet skinner chick
[2022-12-09 15:12:39] <@%MitchP1983> @dkia_97 No, as he doesn't use Spotify for it. Or at all, really. This is a full album playing from YouTube.

[2022-12-09 15:13:05] <@%MitchP1983> @candercorn Not at all. Asking about 3 times in a row after I answered them on the other hand, that might be.
[2022-12-09 15:13:07] <ingnora> The muppet was so bad
[2022-12-09 15:13:17] <@%MitchP1983> @pleepz_ Sure. Dont ask it 3 more times now.
[2022-12-09 15:13:21] <%Blog_12345> Pacino looked confused as to why he was there lol

[2022-12-09 15:46:35] <%marcyyoma> @daveybanana I used to hate Mole but as I got older I love it now. And also I make it better than my mom does so there is that too heyzeusFine

[2022-12-09 15:47:20] <+GrumReapur> I've always found if you find out where the restaurant owners are from language wise, learn a few simple things like greetings and thank you etc in their language they become AMAZING hosts
[2022-12-09 15:47:22] <+ShinyScreenz> You have to go to fancy Vietnamese not like ‘mall Vietnamese’

[2022-12-09 15:49:39] <%$CharlesZane> It was entertaining to make fun of it though.
[2022-12-09 15:49:40] <thefurtive_hunter> They need to make games a bit more difficult.
[2022-12-09 15:49:40] <vicesory> gooooodmorninggg Zeus

[2022-12-09 15:50:14] <HeartBreakJoe> Are the old ones good???
[2022-12-09 15:50:14] <%thescottishgeek> @seekerofstars Was on the phone to the docs again this morning and they were like get more sleep and drink more water..... heyzeusSnide
[2022-12-09 15:50:20] <HeartBreakJoe> I never played it before
[2022-12-09 15:50:24] <%nwmn420> @Dum_Chicken_Biryani i moved down here when i was 5 months old tho so i'm barely from Jersey, just born there
[2022-12-09 15:50:28] <%+nickinmotion> @heyZeusHeresToast have you played any of the Last of Us?
[2022-12-09 15:50:29] <phr05t_Byt3> LUL Mecha-Souls
[2022-12-09 15:50:30] <+ShinyScreenz> 😂
[2022-12-09 15:50:32] <%+vatoloco17> man I love that
[2022-12-09 15:50:36] <thefurtive_hunter> basically mecha dark souls
[2022-12-09 15:50:39] <%Jay7stone> Mech souls like
[2022-12-09 15:50:41] <%frank_mourningtree> franifLol
[2022-12-09 15:50:42] <%+piketaylor> never played an armored core before
[2022-12-09 15:50:45] <%AirTurtle69> fromsoft ruined all other games for me. they just arent fromsoft games
[2022-12-09 15:50:46] <boast3r> is there some trailer from the game awards that interest you? @heyzeusherestoast
[2022-12-09 15:50:46] <marwenlah> are you doing pvp today ?
[2022-12-09 15:50:47] <%darkviking0420> Mech souls* 👌
[2022-12-09 15:50:48] <dkia_97> Basically DS5
[2022-12-09 15:50:53] <themanwitch> What about a system like Sekiro
[2022-12-09 15:50:59] <%nwmn420> @nickinmotion he LOVED the first game. second game was hot fracking garbage
[2022-12-09 15:51:04] <$Dum_Chicken_Biryani> Armored core is not dark souls. its faster but it also has a lot of menuing like Nioh
[2022-12-09 15:51:09] <marwenlah> this new armored core is different
[2022-12-09 15:51:09] <%+Devinguy> following up Elden Ring with an Armored Core title is incredibly based
[2022-12-09 15:51:10] <Zasuraaa> never even heard about armored core
[2022-12-09 15:51:13] <HeartBreakJoe> Oh ok
[2022-12-09 15:51:17] <%$ungabungabonkstick> The last armored core game was made 10 years ago
[2022-12-09 15:51:17] <%+Jartasm> @heyZeusHeresToast Just signed up for my first candy cane flute lessons wish me luck

[2022-12-09 15:51:35] <%$justin6ix9> @heyzeusherestoast with your new PC will you be able to play the old Armored Core games?
[2022-12-09 15:51:37] <88frn> do you know the history/lore behind from games?
[2022-12-09 15:51:37] <+j_olivia97> so excited for armoured core, will feel weird playing a fromsoft game with mech stuff
[2022-12-09 15:51:48] <%henry_deaver> im interested in this game with Chuck Norris, michael madsen, Danny glover and vanilla ice xD
[2022-12-09 15:51:50] <%+vatoloco17> now he has to register
[2022-12-09 15:51:55] <%+Jartasm> LUL Definitely a joke but now I feel obligated to this community of heroes.

[2022-12-09 15:52:07] <marwenlah> from software of 2022 is not fromsoftware of ps3 era
[2022-12-09 15:52:13] <%AirTurtle69> next fromsoft soulslike will probably be like 2 more years lol
[2022-12-09 15:52:15] <%+Jartasm> It's available for pre-order on Epic Games Store right now
[2022-12-09 15:52:17] <%+chapeldweller> You walked away as soon as the trailer started.

[2022-12-09 15:52:55] <shadyjoker27> happy friday!!
[2022-12-09 15:52:57] <HeartBreakJoe> Forspoken looks pretty good
[2022-12-09 15:52:59] <%Blog_12345> Crimeboss actually looked interesting
[2022-12-09 15:53:00] <JoeTheAverage> im convinced lies of p is going to be the steelrising sequel
[2022-12-09 15:53:12] <Carlxzz> forspoken demo is live on ps store brother
[2022-12-09 15:53:12] <HeartBreakJoe> There’s a demo out now
[2022-12-09 15:53:14] <%$justin6ix9> Forspoken is bad
[2022-12-09 15:53:14] <$neowizard887> demo of forspoken is live now
[2022-12-09 15:53:20] <%NoumenonG> Sup Zeus! One thing I've realised when I was trying to explain Bloodborne to my girlfriend is that I understand the game so well in my mind, but whenever I try to explain it, it instantly starts to make absolutely zero sense lmao
[2022-12-09 15:53:20] <%itsCREATIV3> and i'd have to assume elden ring dlc will come out before a new soulslike title will
[2022-12-09 15:53:20] <HeartBreakJoe> I was watching stream on it
[2022-12-09 15:53:25] <%narcolepsy___> the demo is free for forspoken
[2022-12-09 15:53:28] <%calllmecrazyy> The demo is out.  The dialogue is atrocious. But gameplay is interesting
[2022-12-09 15:53:33] <%+jb_patrol> YEAY - I'm allowed to play again RaccAttack
[2022-12-09 15:53:34] <%+Devinguy> Foreheadspoken looks good but not sure how it will play
[2022-12-09 15:53:38] <HeartBreakJoe> Forspoken looked pretty good actually
[2022-12-09 15:53:51] <HeartBreakJoe> But I think it’s a PS5 game only though
[2022-12-09 15:53:52] <thefurtive_hunter> Let's hear the truth Zeus, are you really that hyped for ac? I am not.
[2022-12-09 15:53:54] <%$CharlesZane> Wukong looks slow too

[2022-12-09 15:58:23] <letsgorodriguez_> The Bacanno English voice actors were the best though
[2022-12-09 15:58:24] <%calllmecrazyy> Be sure to turn the “banter” off on the accessibility options for Forspoken. Otherwise the characters never shut up

[2022-12-09 16:00:37] <%uberblooddriver> which studio other than fromsoft you think makes good games?
[2022-12-09 16:00:41] <%nwmn420> ugh!
[2022-12-09 16:00:49] <thefurtive_hunter> Ever since I played the soulsborne, normal games like GoW just don't hit that hard. Gotta die a few times to get the KICK.

[2022-12-09 16:01:18] <+saveddragon> I like insomniac too. Spiderman games are fun
[2022-12-09 16:01:18] <%mrhuntercontent> The Elden Ring memes are hilarious. People said Miyazaki and his team were invaded by a Dark Spirit

[2022-12-09 16:01:24] <letsgorodriguez_> Rockstar back then made better games
[2022-12-09 16:01:38] <%marcyyoma> @nwmn420 I would have to disagree as I thought 13-2 and 15 we're pretty good. Not as good as 10 but they were alright
[2022-12-09 16:01:39] <G__han> how fast is your internet, Zeus?
[2022-12-09 16:01:40] <%nwmn420> Naughty Dog hasn't been good since Crash 3
[2022-12-09 16:01:43] <%SilverWind19C> i only like uncharted
[2022-12-09 16:01:47] <mylifical> gow is a hand holding simulator
[2022-12-09 16:01:53] <%$swoopbandy> uncharted 2 was the standout in the series
[2022-12-09 16:01:54] <marwenlah> god of war is so so overrated dude
[2022-12-09 16:01:54] <%+Jartasm> Naughty Dog makes great games if you like walking forward and tapping X to raise ladders.
[2022-12-09 16:01:57] <%$nickowl12> BAHAHAHA naughty dog

[2022-12-09 16:02:05] <ducksnipple> All the good games seems to come out of japan these days. I have completely lost faith in western developers
[2022-12-09 16:02:15] <%+myteafam> @nwmn420 your opinion. XIV is the only MMO I played and it has a very single player feel to it tbh...its def got FF feel.
[2022-12-09 16:02:18] <+JJ_Slaps> Max Payne 3 is amazing
[2022-12-09 16:02:24] <klevas17> there was a time...
[2022-12-09 16:02:31] <%nwmn420> @myteafam yes, it is my opinion. that's why you see "nwmn420:" next to the message :)
[2022-12-09 16:02:31] <dkia_97> It’s just appealing to more casual players means more costumers. It’s what happened with elden ring which is more accessible to people who are not hard core gamers
[2022-12-09 16:02:38] <marwenlah> if fromsoft does all the next games on the sekiro engine it would crush the competition

[2022-12-09 16:07:09] <%rhysbrando> I like Hades but it can get chaotic imo
[2022-12-09 16:07:17] <%$krovogIot> Hades is definitely more bullet hell than this
[2022-12-09 16:07:19] <JoeTheAverage> me likey
[2022-12-09 16:07:20] <+shaye_the_doll> i mean when you start doing Torment it should not be that contained
[2022-12-09 16:07:21] <%nwmn420> yeah the art style is better than 3 but the game looks like it plays like 3
[2022-12-09 16:07:24] <%rhysbrando> how we feeling about Armored Core?
[2022-12-09 16:07:30] <%$swoopbandy> the lighting is pretty sweet

[2022-12-09 16:08:21] <%$osvaldorockdriguez> @heyZeusHeresToast Elden ring is on the category of the stream
[2022-12-09 16:08:24] <%+myteafam> POE never interested me...vids I see are just running through dungeons n everything dies around you. Real engaging gameplay.
[2022-12-09 16:08:26] <%rhysbrando> I never got to play Diablo 1 or 2, I did enjoy playing 3 with friends tho
[2022-12-09 16:08:29] <%+jb_patrol> I've never played a Diablo game but for some reason.....i get the sense it's followers are gatekeepers and won't accept a newbie. Maybe, and hopefully, I'm wrong
[2022-12-09 16:08:35] <+shaye_the_doll> nioh is diablo and ninja gaiden having a baby while ds3 watches

[2022-12-09 16:11:48] <%$MothDaddyWubs> dude that kid lmao
[2022-12-09 16:11:49] <%eldritch_lie> Arrested for what though did he commit a crime?
[2022-12-09 16:11:56] <%rhysbrando> making Bill Clinton a Prophet in Elden Ring in honor of that giga chad
[2022-12-09 16:11:57] <%DenimJeans2006> Didn't win a steam deck, but that interaction was worth it LUL

[2022-12-09 16:12:13] <@%MitchP1983> 'Arrested for what? I thought this was America!"
[2022-12-09 16:12:13] <%rhysbrando> I think they had to detain him because he's some rando who just came on stage, as like a safety precaution
[2022-12-09 16:12:13] <Deathism> kanye came on stage right after said Elden Ring was great but God of war had some of the greatest music of all ime
[2022-12-09 16:12:16] <Deathism> time*
[2022-12-09 16:12:24] <nelsonicrage217> amogus DLC actually looks like a decent and creative expansion on their game
[2022-12-09 16:12:35] <%+shinra441> imagine what the devs were thinking when they saw the kid standing behind him
[2022-12-09 16:12:38] <%SilverWind19C> ! invaded by dark spirit !
[2022-12-09 16:12:50] <%rhysbrando> according to some deep divers on Twitter the kid was on InfoWars once??? but idk who accurate that is because Twitter
[2022-12-09 16:12:50] <%bingbingsy> lol
[2022-12-09 16:12:58] <ashenangel_> developers thought he was with game awards, game awards thought he was with developers
[2022-12-09 16:12:58] <%$MothDaddyWubs> they waterboarded him
[2022-12-09 16:13:00] <%Blog_12345> legendary
[2022-12-09 16:13:01] <+shaye_the_doll> miyazaki lookeed so confused
[2022-12-09 16:13:01] <%eldritch_lie> @MitchP1983 Just arrest people without a reason? Seems kinda sus tbh
[2022-12-09 16:13:07] <%itsCREATIV3> the zoom out while security swarmed was hilarious
[2022-12-09 16:13:12] <%DenimJeans2006> I'm sure this has been asked 1500 times, but what's the download for?
[2022-12-09 16:13:17] <%narcolepsy___> Geoff was pissed atpRtsd
[2022-12-09 16:13:18] <%$krovogIot> oh Twitter, we know how smart those fellas are
[2022-12-09 16:13:20] <guelle2410> @heyZeusHeresToast under what charges could he possibly be arrested though?
[2022-12-09 16:13:24] <DagonMaster_98> also the 10 minuts speach from Chisptofer was hilaryus as fck
[2022-12-09 16:13:27] <nuariyhon> he could have yelled bloodborne to pc at 60 fps and became the ultimate meme
[2022-12-09 16:13:30] <Deathism> my name jeff
[2022-12-09 16:13:34] <@%MitchP1983> @eldritch_lie It was a South Park reference...
[2022-12-09 16:13:45] <Deathism> i could name a few
[2022-12-09 16:13:46] <%+AkaiSuisei1776> disorderly conduct
[2022-12-09 16:13:57] <%eldritch_lie> @MitchP1983 Ahh that's one thing I haven't seen  NotLikeThis
[2022-12-09 16:14:00] <%itsCREATIV3> at least he didn't pull a will smith
[2022-12-09 16:14:03] <%Blog_12345> the security should be the ones getting chewed out tbh
[2022-12-09 16:14:06] <%rhysbrando> honestly I'm more concerned that no one questioned his credentials and he got on stage at all? like that worries me more because anyone could potentially do it

[2022-12-09 16:14:11] <%+chapeldweller> Dimebag Darrel would disagree about it being no big deal.
[2022-12-09 16:14:12] <thefurtive_hunter> Should've slapped Chris judge or someone while he was there, since he got arrested anyway.
[2022-12-09 16:14:17] <%uberblooddriver> what if the kid shouted gow is the game of year? is he still innocent ?
[2022-12-09 16:14:20] <Habibou_Amadou> face surgery Zeus?
[2022-12-09 16:14:24] <%+shinra441> it seems they would have cause to eject him from the property, maybe trespass him but i doubt anything sticks
[2022-12-09 16:14:27] <%eldritch_lie> @Skyzark_Vic Yooo Vic how ya doin?
[2022-12-09 16:14:31] <klevas17> milions went to that event and he went on stage, not rly a good thing to do
[2022-12-09 16:14:31] <%+Devinguy> flute guy > nonsense kid
[2022-12-09 16:14:37] <%$MothDaddyWubs> so they didnt water board him?

[2022-12-09 16:14:47] <%+myteafam> He didnt try to harass anyone....waited to the end of the speech...best manners ever for someone crashing an awards.
[2022-12-09 16:14:51] <+thatOGd_a_k> It’s probably the same charge people get when they run onto a field while a game is being played
[2022-12-09 16:14:54] <jebus12000> Maybe trespassing
[2022-12-09 16:15:06] <%eldritch_lie> @Skyzark_Vic Not bad, holiday just started so i'm in intense chill mode
[2022-12-09 16:15:17] <%+chapeldweller> @eldritch_lie I'm not really joking. it's fucking sad what happened. that's why him getting on stage I think is scarier than it seems
[2022-12-09 16:15:25] <%+AlexShotFirst> hey bud!! morning morning
[2022-12-09 16:15:30] <%rhysbrando> yeah definitely, that's why I'm saying security at the game awards needs to be tighter. I hate to be a catastrophic thinker but what if he had bad intent?
[2022-12-09 16:15:31] <benzopan> oh yeah

[2022-12-09 16:16:52] <%ateoz891> i heard the awards last night was the same garbage like last year🤣
[2022-12-09 16:16:52] <%eldritch_lie> @chapeldweller I mean what happened to dimebag is not because of bad security, its because of mental health issues with people. it is sad what happened to dimebag i agree. But the issue isnt people getting on stage that was a basic manners on behalf of the kid
[2022-12-09 16:16:52] <%$MothDaddyWubs> jeff keely is actually the head of security too
[2022-12-09 16:16:52] <@%MitchP1983> @ethanfrazer05 Liked it. Obviously.
[2022-12-09 16:16:54] <+Casavilla458> I thought the game awards would have the cheapest security guards possible like loss prevention

[2022-12-09 16:17:07] <+shaye_the_doll> yeah but you're telling me that i can just get up from my seat and follow someone and security doesnt notice?
[2022-12-09 16:17:12] <ashenangel_> 1. walks up stage 2. dedicates award to bill clinton 3. refuses to elaborate 4. gets arrested
[2022-12-09 16:17:16] <%eldritch_lie> lack of manners @chapeldweller

[2022-12-09 16:17:32] <%+myteafam> When he was on stage early in the soeech you could see him moving to be in shot....he seemed out of place straight away to me.

[2022-12-09 16:18:36] <%+chapeldweller> @eldritch_lie I do think the issue is how easy he got on stage. luckily all he did was spout some done shit. but it shouldn't be brushed off just cause nothing bad happened

[2022-12-09 16:21:06] <%eldritch_lie> @chapeldweller I mean if he wanted to do something bad he didn't need to get on stage right? Security to get into the event was probably good enough to avoid someone bringing a gun, if someone then wants to do dumb stuff like run on stage or stuff like that its up to him and good sense i believe

[2022-12-09 16:23:53] <%eldritch_lie> @chapeldweller How: because the security was slacking and it doesnt take much to walk on stage unless you wanna put up a gate or something or a line of security which ruins the vibe imo Why: cuz the kid wanted to meme around and do dumb stuff

[2022-12-09 16:47:05] <+LtJenkins> co2 isn't inherently acidic. It turns in to carbonic acid with water
[2022-12-09 16:47:07] <SenatorSigma> carbonic acid is a buffer.

[2022-12-09 16:57:53] <@%MitchP1983> @xtskater I've never had an issue. I've seen Zeus play it 100 times on PS5 and no issues there either!
[2022-12-09 16:58:06] <%ford9863> did Zeus end up getting to fallingstar yesterday?
[2022-12-09 16:58:17] <%EternalBelgarath> You can un-invert if desired

[2022-12-09 18:03:44] <GimmickMusic> Blaidd is one of these, but he fought his instincts and helped Ranni instead of killing her. That was the understanding I got from taking to Igi anyway

[2022-12-09 18:06:17] <@%MitchP1983> @eldenjon So, what you're saying is that you didn't actually read the chat rules you clicked accept on and agreed to follow. ;)
