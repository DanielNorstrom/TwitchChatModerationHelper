[2022-12-26 16:45:35] <sirgregoryadams> @oantzaaa You just need to do some math. RF damages you for 90% of your max HP + 70% of your max ES. So that's how much damage you take per second. Then you lower that by whatever your capped fire res is, and whatever damage still being applied to you you're left with, that's what you need to out-regen (i.e. your HP regen needs to be higher than that.)

[2022-12-26 16:48:37] <sirgregoryadams> @oantzaaa So, let's say your max HP is 1000 and max ES is 1000, then RF damages you for 900+700=1600/second. So you lower it by your capped fire res = 304 fire damage/second. Meaning that your flat HP regen needs to be at least 304 to break even. But, of course, you need more to actually recover HP.
[2022-12-26 16:48:44] <zaurons> @greitdet if u dont know this, dont go to RF build

[2022-12-26 17:09:21] <%i3lue_Fire> i have a question i have always been too afraid to ask. how does "5% of Damage taken Recouped as Life" work? it sounds like it should be very similar if not the same as 5% less damage
[2022-12-26 17:09:24] <ShermanB3> @protomanex14 exactly not at all. if your build has screen wide clear you don't need them. Look at rue cf champ, he has 6 endurance charges on kill+enduring cry on bosses and have all offensive auras. If you play correctly and have a  bit of dmg you clear 99% of enemies 2 screens away so you are never in danger during mapping. You also invest in a lot of max res instead of suppression and even a bit of spellblock later and you are completely fine. WIth fortitude and stun immunity on top of all t
[2022-12-26 17:09:27] <+callahz> good luck for ssf!

[2022-12-26 17:13:08] <+Flymyty> I took out hextouch and replaced it with flame dash, because i like the mobility. As far as i can tell i didn't break anything, well besides obviously i have to cast curse now. Do you i have anything else i should worry about?

[2022-12-26 17:14:05] <+Flymyty> Yeah i've noticed the lower exposure, but also 99% targets don't need it

[2022-12-26 17:42:09] <Skadavra> carn wants to make a guide like you too, but hes lazy LUL
[2022-12-26 17:42:18] <%+Adellund> arrogance is to reserve life instead of mana ( flat ) since u dont care aas jugg ( ur literally immortal )
[2022-12-26 17:42:23] VIEWERS: 1 189
[2022-12-26 17:42:24] <cptspank> I discovered you 2 leagues ago followed your builds with a few changes here and there. You are one of the few guys that makes amazing guides from lvl 1-100
[2022-12-26 17:42:25] <%+Adellund> the empower is for when u swap to helmet
[2022-12-26 17:42:33] <ExiledOzzy> im finding rf truly difficult in sanctums cos im bad.. is there an easy skill/gear swap to help with sanctums? i tried srs but couldnt get the damage from it..

[2022-12-26 17:43:04] <ExiledOzzy> hehe.. cheers man
[2022-12-26 17:43:42] <ShafTea> So in the game your character has empower and AOE support linked to the RF in helm, but in POB it's vitality and arrogance that's linked instead. I was asking if the lower dps is worth the larger AOE @Pohx
[2022-12-26 17:43:50] <%Forseak> I found some pretty good inspiration relics early on and never had any problems with sanctum since then
[2022-12-26 17:44:01] <%+Adellund> @ExiledOzzy  gimmie ur pob (acc name so i can look it up on PoB) maybe I can help u fix ur SRS build
[2022-12-26 17:44:09] <%spooper_trooper> vitality and arrogance has nothing to do with the empower set up
[2022-12-26 17:44:10] <+Trolstoy> morning sir
[2022-12-26 17:44:16] <charcoal8> lot of work and streamers play what is meta or great for league content so doing several char guides of this level is just too much
[2022-12-26 17:44:21] <ShafTea> Sorry I meant lifetap not arrogance @Pohx

[2022-12-26 17:44:58] <balkata> can the jugg  RF build be leagusterter ?

[2022-12-26 17:44:58] <cmonBroh> @ShafTea empower is better
[2022-12-26 17:45:13] <cptspank> someone said on global chat you are not a good player because you make HC builds for SC. I disagree, you build is one of the few ones I had fun from 1-100
[2022-12-26 17:45:16] <charcoal8> and mr streamer worked on his stuff for long time so he acumulated lot of stuff over the years
[2022-12-26 17:45:17] <$threttz> I’m kinda new and I’m on yellow maps right now I’m following ur guide for inquisitor but I was wondering why put life tap with RF it doesn’t seem to Proc it ?
[2022-12-26 17:45:21] <b0nezxnxrezidue> EZ
[2022-12-26 17:45:28] <ShafTea> alright gotcha sorry the gem names confuse me lol
[2022-12-26 17:45:32] <ExiledOzzy> @Adellund i swapped out of srs and went back rf and just skip sanctums now.. i might try an srs helm or chest as a quick swap for it tho

[2022-12-26 17:46:08] <%spooper_trooper> ShafTea try to follow the basic leveling set up, after a certain point, when empower gets involved, there is a level of self-determination involved that requires that you know what you're doing to maximize dps

[2022-12-26 17:46:38] <%+IamDreameR_> @threttz The lifetap+swift affliction on RF is for the buff you get when you use ohter skill with Lifetap.
[2022-12-26 17:46:41] <sirgregoryadams> @threttz When lifetap has quality, it passively increases the damage of whatever it is linked to.
[2022-12-26 17:46:51] <ShafTea> @spooper_trooper @cmonBroh empower never gets mentioned in the pob so that's why I was wondering
[2022-12-26 17:46:52] <2provief> the main skill in poe is game knowledge and he for sure have a good chunk of it .

[2022-12-26 17:47:35] <cmonBroh> @ShafTea u have to sometimes also use ur brain and pob stuff to see why mr streamer deviates from his guide

[2022-12-26 17:49:03] <+corehammer> question at the sideline chat, where would you try to get an empower if you were to "farm" for one? heist?
[2022-12-26 17:49:07] <cptspank> I agree. And your guides are amazing for mapping, which I like a lot. I played a lot of builds that were glass cannon and died while mapping. But RF has a relaxing gamplay

[2022-12-26 17:49:42] <Waaghbafet> does will you switch to RF in this playthrough u think? or is it a matter of finding the right gear
[2022-12-26 17:49:55] <%spooper_trooper> for max dps, but it requires a specific set up

[2022-12-26 17:55:48] <+flawedHumanBro> Agreed about trade… used to only play SSF but then they nerfed unique drops and I can’t play fun builds without them.
[2022-12-26 17:55:54] <b0nezxnxrezidue> SSF your items has a story behind them, as opposed to "Hey I just Bought a item experience"
[2022-12-26 17:55:57] <krimzin_wizard> then you message 10 people who dont respond, the 11 invites you. then 2 of the 10 that ignored you invite you after you got ur item. nice system ggg :)

[2022-12-26 17:56:06] <sirgregoryadams> @bushwookies Funny enough, the fact that trading is a pain stabilizes prices. If it was much easier, it would tank the in-game economy.
[2022-12-26 17:56:07] <+TheGrumpyOldBeard> honestly cant dissagree with any of those statments
[2022-12-26 17:56:07] <welchaczep> Damn, Maybe I will try SSF
[2022-12-26 17:56:09] <@%lemoncoolers> @ExiledOzzy if players have an easier time acquiring items, that means the power level of the character increases more quickly thus people "finish" their characters in a shorter amount of time thus spend less time in the game thus spend less money. They WANT trading to have friction to keep power gain slow.
[2022-12-26 17:56:12] <Tembulon> Trade is so trash on purpose.
[2022-12-26 17:56:14] <%aka_rev0> how about join ho and give a trade before sellers?)
[2022-12-26 17:56:14] <Dougizzle> Its not fun when the entire game loop is just the best way to farm currency to buy items on trade, then its basically a day job

[2022-12-26 17:56:39] <+aidlawski> it isn't even done in game and that really bothers me how an almost essential part of the economy is impacted by mechanics outside of the game
[2022-12-26 17:56:42] <+Solomon_Kain> I don't like trading, but I think they do have a good system, what I find not fun is the inablility to farm gear through gameplay. You could never build a charachter that needs specific uniques without trade due to dogshit droprates.

[2022-12-26 17:56:46] <@%lemoncoolers> @Dougizzle for some people that's fun. It's all subjective. Thankfully SSF exists.
[2022-12-26 17:56:50] <+ben82081> the complexity problems are inevitable because PoE is a complex game with complex gear system, but the human element stuff seems fixable
[2022-12-26 17:56:50] <Shatraugh> the list of unfun in trade leaque is too long for me aswell. SSF = simply fun :)
[2022-12-26 17:56:57] <krimzin_wizard> turn public stashes into a public stash people can go in themselves  to exchange.
[2022-12-26 17:57:01] <bushwookies> @sirgregoryadams absolutely it kind of limits the amount of trades made
[2022-12-26 17:57:12] <%SolidLogik> I've hit a wall on my jugg, level 83 and being held back by my gear. I struggle in t9 maps and I have almost zero currency to craft my gear. Sadge
[2022-12-26 17:57:16] <%CutterSnake> Trading is super importend for me because I do craft everything myself and I wasted around 250 Tripple Socket Resonator and 750 Fossils ... farming that would be a pain for me.

[2022-12-26 17:58:08] <cptspank> the problem I have with SSF is that at some point I will need a lot of rare currency to improve, like fracturing orbs. Farming for days to get a good fracture is boring. So I just buy it
[2022-12-26 17:58:10] <@%lemoncoolers> It's GGG's problem, right.

[2022-12-26 17:58:18] <+BigChief_95> @Solomon_Kain well.... thats a time based argument. Maybe you could rule out mageblood and HH etc but most other uniques are farmable if you play enough. Manni is a perfect example of sweaty play any build you want SSF.

[2022-12-26 18:13:56] <ShermanB3> @Mishrachan no. That's it :D. You need to prepare to grind some things you would get for 1c literally in trade tho. You can go trade and play sudo-ssf and only trade when you have to really if you want to. It's good approach I think you will learn the most that way right.

[2022-12-26 18:30:09] <~%Pohx> @duskhorizon you should look at my crafting guides on pohx.net
[2022-12-26 18:30:09] <ShermanB3> @hazzqt you can use sacrifice fragment yo open vaal side area I think and it drops few vaal gems and vaal orb really often

[2022-12-26 19:02:21] <+MadLeds> if you are a noob (like me) and you don't get good drops this struggles a little bit on SSF

[2022-12-26 20:45:41] <Mauresques> What I do to not struggle with Pohx's build : Read twice everything because he doesn't put irrelevant infos or overwhelming things and if/when it doesn't work : 100% of times I am/was the problem.

[2022-12-26 21:40:40] <Zeuran> They need different elements for RF
[2022-12-26 21:40:43] <Zeuran> xD
[2022-12-26 21:40:47] <lonelygameplay> have you ever played any other build other than RF?
[2022-12-26 21:40:48] <Yukiyuki_> cold rf would be fun like a permanent vortex

[2022-12-26 21:40:53] <cptspank> yo, I just noticed the dot on searing bond totem is almost double compared with fire trap. Maybe secretely op?

[2022-12-26 21:41:06] <%SolidLogik> its because we grew up with the diablo 2 version of chain lightning and watched it demolish mobs
[2022-12-26 21:41:07] <shado712> also cant hit same nob 2 times like normal chain lighting spells

[2022-12-26 21:42:43] <Zeuran> oh btw pohx is scorching ray still a good option for bossing?
[2022-12-26 21:42:50] <Woolfio> @chunglyy can only convert hit damage
[2022-12-26 21:42:53] <Zeuran> im kinda old school
[2022-12-26 21:43:14] <binryong> would you want that they make RF but with different damage type? Maybe new skill or just alt quality that would change the damage to lightning for example
[2022-12-26 21:43:14] <lenbbo> standing still sucks
[2022-12-26 21:43:18] <%tiny_pickle_packer> are there any drops rarer than a mirror hmm
[2022-12-26 21:43:41] <+Skandle> no cause ive had a mageblood xD
[2022-12-26 21:43:45] <Zeuran> *shrugs* i think mirror is rarer

[2022-12-26 21:43:46] <%tiny_pickle_packer> LUL

[2022-12-26 21:44:09] <Zeuran> i think the only thing rarer than a mirror is a perfect 6 tier 1 item

[2022-12-26 21:44:15] <Plausibly_Sane> sacred orbs are rarer than a divine. but not worth as much. rarity isn't always equal value
[2022-12-26 21:44:25] <+Skandle> true
[2022-12-26 21:44:44] <Zeuran> mirror service be costing 2 mirrors, shts absurd
[2022-12-26 21:44:55] <439857345053> can a rare belt ever beat a mageblood?
[2022-12-26 21:45:00] <+Skandle> wait a mirror for the item plus 2 mirrors as a cost??? @Zeuran
[2022-12-26 21:45:03] <Yukiyuki_> @tiny_pickle_packer getting mirror shard that gets converted to full mirror through harbingers is probably more rare than normal mirror drop
[2022-12-26 21:45:04] <Plausibly_Sane> then don't use TFT mirror shop. @Zeuran i had a service done for 100d
[2022-12-26 21:45:22] <Zeuran> there are people charging a mirror as service fee
[2022-12-26 21:45:30] <+Deathgears> are there any good ways to cover in ash outside of infernal cry? the forbidden flame/flesh that does it is a bit out of my reach still
[2022-12-26 21:45:33] <Plausibly_Sane> then don't use their service *shrug*
[2022-12-26 21:45:35] <phadac> well even cwdt cant beat single item and cwdt is whole build around sustaining perma flaks
[2022-12-26 21:45:41] <Zeuran> pretty much...
[2022-12-26 21:45:41] <+Batilla> I mean if the item cost more than a mirror
[2022-12-26 21:45:43] <orthiar> I just got my first ever Mageblood today (as an SSF player) and I am just living in PoB planning builds around it.
[2022-12-26 21:45:49] <TheBDPlayer> mageblood can easily be all your defence layers

[2022-12-26 21:50:07] <SpeedyRabbit> not an RF question, but is there a point in double casting Malevolance in a Divine Blessing + Inspiration link? it lets you do that but i dont get why

[2022-12-26 21:50:28] <@%lemoncoolers> @Zeuran No that has to do with how dps is calculated in the game for damage over time.

[2022-12-26 21:52:07] <adolebitque> Deep delving requires builds that will kill everything before they touch you (as far as I know, at least)

[2022-12-26 21:52:38] <@%lemoncoolers> RF is perfect for delving. You do damage while walking.

[2022-12-26 22:05:17] <TheKatze> check the old pirate man
[2022-12-26 22:05:21] <+thatbigcrit> @lemoncoolers it was a scion herald staker build that was super popular
[2022-12-26 22:05:25] <@%lemoncoolers> @ultrasuperhyper look up a video and learn the fight. Get a remove burn flask.
[2022-12-26 22:05:33] <+Kal_lmn> One quick question for general gearing. For example, right now I am looking for a good ring, should I pick up every ring and identify it, or would it be better to ignore and just look for currency and buy one?
[2022-12-26 22:05:36] <+Skandle> maven is hugely mechanical
