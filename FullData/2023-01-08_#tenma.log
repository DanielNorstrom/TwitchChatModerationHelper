[2023-01-08 18:23:06] <Nuumers> I just googled a bit and got this: "Many Greeks believed that Hades, the ruler of the realm of the dead, had no children of his own. As a lord of dead things, he was incapable of creating new life. Some traditions, however, believed otherwise. They named several deities, some not recognized elsewhere in Greek religion, that were supposedly born to the king and queen of the Underworld. One of these was Melinoe, Persephone and Hades‚Äô daughter."
