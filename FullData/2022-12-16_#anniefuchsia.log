[2022-12-16 10:28:45] <%Geoffku> that happened to me when I dc'ed before last boss in nokhud xdd listened to the whole fight

[2022-12-16 11:30:06] <%Taylor131313> -50 minutes attempting HOV 14 Pain
[2022-12-16 11:30:19] <%Taylor131313> why do I do this to myself Pain
[2022-12-16 11:44:45] <%Swiggyswoo_> 3 minutes over time in hov 16 last night Sadeg
[2022-12-16 11:45:33] <%Swiggyswoo_> full pull up to dragon before boss seems rougher than it used to
[2022-12-16 11:46:26] <%Taylor131313> how do you deal with the wolf split aoe
[2022-12-16 11:46:28] <%Taylor131313> it was massacring us
[2022-12-16 11:46:32] <%Swiggyswoo_> You pray KEKW
[2022-12-16 11:46:56] <%Taylor131313> me: we did HOV 13 with a paper tank, gonna be fine Clueless
[2022-12-16 11:47:00] <%Taylor131313> me in HOV 14: Aware
[2022-12-16 11:47:48] <%Swiggyswoo_> Even tank gets oneshot by raging wolves so pull small and insta soothe LUL
[2022-12-16 11:48:24] <%Taylor131313> no I meant the boss
[2022-12-16 11:49:11] <%Swiggyswoo_> you mean the aoe he does?
[2022-12-16 11:49:20] <%Swiggyswoo_> like the uh
[2022-12-16 11:50:00] <%Taylor131313> https://i.imgur.com/xpL7UOI.png this shit
[2022-12-16 11:50:19] <%Swiggyswoo_> Oh yeah I mean just make sure everyone's in melee
[2022-12-16 11:50:23] <%Swiggyswoo_> the rest is up to the healer
[2022-12-16 11:50:36] <%Taylor131313> even with 3-4 in melee we were still getting clapped eventually
[2022-12-16 11:50:39] <%Taylor131313> guess healer was questinable
[2022-12-16 11:51:18] <%Swiggyswoo_> Gotta have everyone in melee at all times tbh, also the fights gets harder and harder obv cus of bleed stacks
[2022-12-16 11:51:51] <%Swiggyswoo_> If ppl mess up bleeds as well you get stacks on everyone
[2022-12-16 11:51:59] <%Taylor131313> exactly xdd
[2022-12-16 11:52:23] <%Taylor131313> it looks like the minimum goal of getting a 15 this week is harder than I expected TrollDespair
[2022-12-16 11:53:37] <%Swiggyswoo_> Gets easier for every piece of gear you get tho so should be doable FeelsOkayMan
[2022-12-16 11:53:44] <%Taylor131313> wait, gear drops?
[2022-12-16 11:53:50] <%Taylor131313> I thought only cloaks dropped
[2022-12-16 11:53:52] <%Taylor131313> TrollDespair
[2022-12-16 11:53:57] <%Swiggyswoo_> ikr
[2022-12-16 11:54:12] <%Taylor131313> I got 4 drops in like 15 dungeons, 2 were cloaks
[2022-12-16 11:54:13] <%Swiggyswoo_> did 10 dungs without loot but got a bit luckier on the last few so did get some upgrades
[2022-12-16 11:54:25] <%Swiggyswoo_> what ilvl u at now?
[2022-12-16 11:54:40] <%Taylor131313> basically the same as before KEKW

[2022-12-16 11:56:23] <%Taylor131313> I do have the feeling I gotta swallow my pride a bit and drop down to 10s for gear
[2022-12-16 11:56:46] <%Swiggyswoo_> do 10s or preferably 11s so you get focus
[2022-12-16 11:58:42] <%Taylor131313> I do see your key though swiggy anniesC
