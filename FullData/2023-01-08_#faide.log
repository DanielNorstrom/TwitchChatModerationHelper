[2023-01-08 01:57:49] <@%^Nightbot> For anyone that doesn't know. Tap strafing is a mechanic of the source engine. For movement on Mnk to not feel sluggish, they use something called lurch. Which basically sets the values to instant on and instant off (1 and 0). Controllers have a benefit since they can do values between 0 up to 1, while it's impossible on a kb. Tap strafing just exploits this functional mechanic. jordanbrandoo

[2023-01-08 02:28:15] <@%^Nightbot> Faide prefers to play on 180 because trying to play on 240hz can apparently cause input delay in-game. In addition, it just feels better, so thank you for your understanding :) Have a pleasant day

[2023-01-08 23:56:41] <@%^Nightbot> Faide prefers to play on 180 because trying to play on 240hz can apparently cause input delay in-game. In addition, it just feels better, so thank you for your understanding :) Have a pleasant day

[2023-01-08 23:58:19] <@%RipCrow97> @SAKRAYx He owns a 280hz monitor, but apex can go up to 240hz. But, because 240hz is not well to play on thats why he plays on 180.
[2023-01-08 23:58:21] <potatoland1> how do you do that?

[2023-01-08 23:59:38] <@%Entity7x> Refresh rate measures how often your monitor 'refreshes' to display a new image, whereas FPS refers to how many frames your GPU renders per second
