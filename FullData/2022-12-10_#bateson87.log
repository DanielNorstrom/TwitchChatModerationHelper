[2022-12-10 13:31:12] <jobe29> so chat, out of 10, how would you rate the World Cup so far...1 being pants 10 being awsome  ?
[2022-12-10 13:31:16] <anwwaar> i think 3-2 france
[2022-12-10 13:31:16] <%+Gareth1407> i see saka tearing up theo hernandez and im utd fan
[2022-12-10 13:31:25] <+lukeozade8> 2-0 England I think a repeat of the Germany game in euros
[2022-12-10 13:31:35] <Dapeton> I honestly cant see england hold france from scoring for 90 min, my prediction would be a late equalizer for england, ends in penalties
[2022-12-10 13:31:35] <%+Gareth1407> also welsh
[2022-12-10 13:31:40] <jobe29> I'd give it an 8 so far
[2022-12-10 13:31:59] <%dryasscookiess> 8
