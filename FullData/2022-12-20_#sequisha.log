[2022-12-20 16:43:28] <TheApiculturist> For me, unless the weapon damage increase reduces the number of hits to kill than I don‚Äôt see the value in the higher damage. As Barb it‚Äôs usually 1-2 hits to kill a player and a jump from 50 to 70 damage doesn‚Äôt change that.

[2022-12-20 16:58:23] <+Kroovy> Man, I absolutely suck at Dark and Darker. I probably shouldn't be trying to solo queue
[2022-12-20 16:58:30] <+Jinxso> @recnepsir Very possible.   It really is nasty for sure.
[2022-12-20 16:58:40] <rowstyles> im really excited for how they expand the spell memory stuff. for example, i think it would be cool if you could level up your spells while IN the raid. if you killed a boss, maybe you unlock a higher tier spell for the rest of that raid
[2022-12-20 16:58:47] <%+authorized411> can there be more than 16 players in a map?

[2022-12-20 16:59:00] <rowstyles> i think they could do a lot of cool stuff with the wizard / spell memory
[2022-12-20 16:59:04] <%velathore> @Krasn0o it seems like that at first, but once you get used to playing your character your can 1v2 or 1v3 and win at times.
[2022-12-20 16:59:04] <+Jinxso> @recnepsir When the mage is faster than the rogue and does more dmg, something ain't right
[2022-12-20 16:59:04] <fwamewadth> @Krasn0o Well that is fine, the devs targeted audience is groups, they are not ignoring solo players, but they are not catering to them either, if you don't want to play it because you always fight groups, then by all means, just move onto another game ü§∑

[2022-12-20 17:01:36] <+Ziva_sees> @rowstyles thats a bad argument. Everything can be solved with solo queue. It will also appeal to more poeple and add to player base. no negatives
[2022-12-20 17:01:40] <+LiechensteiN> just gotta make sure to hit your swings, it has a brutal recovery time if you miss compared to hit

[2022-12-20 17:02:01] <rowstyles> yeah i agree. i mean most 3-mans are very bad in my experience and you can easily leave the fight. some know how to play together‚Äîso as a solo, you will probably die. its just pixels!

[2022-12-20 17:02:31] <rowstyles> @rowstyles no. there's no point in developing a game and try to cater to every single play style. there are other games. the devs should make the game they want to make‚Äîfull stop.

[2022-12-20 17:03:41] <fwamewadth> @rowstyles Okay, then go become a game developer and do it yourself. The game is designed for group play, everything is balanced on that too. If you now add solo queue, then you'll have to cater to the people who don't like "meta" such as rogues, rangers, wizards and clerics being some of the strongest while everything else is somewhat weaker without gear. This is an alpha, let the game grow and maybe one day there will be a solo queue. I'm sure the devs are just trying to get as much data per t
[2022-12-20 17:03:41] <+Alcopwned> Thanks guys
[2022-12-20 17:03:41] <+Jinxso> @recnepsir Agreed.  It is important to have str/weaknesses in each class, it makes the game feel and play so much better.  PvP will always be a hard balance with someone coming out on top.   Just have to keep it close.

[2022-12-20 17:08:15] <%+Phoenix_Zera> @ins_space The "vision" works as long as it's what people will pay for. VHS is a great example of vision that turned into a dead game. POE tried to pull back into the original vision in 3.15 and the devs had to go full damage control mode because they lost ~30% of their sales

[2022-12-20 17:50:45] <chaselightspeed> I also noticed when I was playing, I was running into groups of 2-3 within, 30 seconds of spawning. So it was just me getting constant buttpoundings for like an hour

[2022-12-20 17:51:09] <carog_the_fat> In a DnD world melee should do mroe damage than ranged as not every class gets ranged attacks

[2022-12-20 17:51:46] <+HermitStew> @chaselightspeed yeah, you'll come to learn which spawn points have quick access shortcuts to other spawn points -- folks have memorized the obvious ones and rush the nearby spot

[2022-12-20 17:52:32] <+AG3ntleOrca> I love the idea of this game however a friend had an important point. This game doesn't really have a goal to work towards and a lot of collecting and playing is pointless I would love to hear what you have to say about it.

[2022-12-20 17:52:45] <xvoss> if you get up close to a ranger, they are 100% doomed. so range attacks are pretty good where they're at rn
[2022-12-20 17:52:46] <+papipicantee> @darkb1gu wait where is the matchmaking?
[2022-12-20 17:52:46] <+HermitStew> @Finvader I love solo. I like the dark souls difficulty setting
[2022-12-20 17:52:52] <+damnbul> @Sequisha both grades of healing potions stack. Heals you faster than bandages.

[2022-12-20 17:53:24] <+tc2030> @AG3ntleOrca there are other progression, character types and perks not in game yet. its an alpha
[2022-12-20 17:53:30] <+lasttshadows> @oreantear I'll take either one, but I feel the sidestep/dodge could really make the class to powerful. it's combo possibilities are to strong in pvp

[2022-12-20 17:54:20] <+vampyzz> @AG3ntleOrca this type of game only attracts the pvp players. There isn't an "end goal" necessarily like with an mmorpg
[2022-12-20 17:54:23] <+papipicantee> @arkhlash way more geared squads in high
[2022-12-20 17:54:34] <%insmett1elf> JFC, Tarkov is way further in their development than this game. This game is a year "old" aka in development. Tarkov is for like 10 years?

[2022-12-20 17:54:37] <+lasttshadows> @oreantear a block would force the class to interrupt attack combos. would be good for pvp. and good for the rogue

[2022-12-20 18:14:02] <+Khartrik> maybe the first 2 circles could be quicker and the remaining circles a bit slow

[2022-12-20 19:29:28] <OzymandiasJ> rogue is hard solo until you get a good dagger
[2022-12-20 19:29:28] <+Bleeski> i think rogue is the best solo lol o.O
[2022-12-20 19:29:28] <Waaam> rogue is best solo class probably LUL
[2022-12-20 19:29:29] <+FishStoriesToldHere> rogue is the easiest solo, for me
[2022-12-20 19:29:29] <%+RoxxyWuffLIVE> With starting gear, super hard lmao
[2022-12-20 19:29:32] <+Lanoitakude> Rogue seems like one of the best solo classes.
[2022-12-20 19:29:33] <%+Acuity_> tbh i have warmed up to the rogue play, always feel like we're on the edge of our seats
[2022-12-20 19:29:33] <RickDeez90> Rogue is really good solo against other solos
[2022-12-20 19:29:34] <%+spookyskellly> you just have to play smarter you cant rush
[2022-12-20 19:29:34] <goodguyhadess> Rogue is way easier solo
[2022-12-20 19:29:34] <%+blazinmonkey> @tufixekt pulled cuz people abused him
[2022-12-20 19:29:38] <sentinelinger> cleric is really hard solo opening a chest feels like building the mars rover

[2022-12-20 19:29:47] <%Seretanplays> You can pretty much pick your fights as a roque, easy to avoid stuff.

[2022-12-20 19:29:55] <+wowff> perhaps against npcs harder but against players rogue ez
[2022-12-20 19:29:57] <xaeblue> cleric solo is fun if you know where enemies are and you can pre-buff

[2022-12-20 19:30:31] <sentinelinger> @xaeblue cleric interaction speed is so obnoxious, by the time i looted a chest the raid is almost over LUL
[2022-12-20 19:30:48] <+wowff> @RoxxyWuffLIVE i belevie some kind of room exist that has good loot but no one knows where it is

[2022-12-20 19:30:55] <OzymandiasJ> @sentinelinger i wish clerics at least got fast magic interaction speed but using a healing shrine or rez shrine is like the whole raid

[2022-12-20 19:32:31] <tamahawkz> does the inventory stack amongst the different classes now?

[2022-12-20 19:33:16] <Waaam> damn 5 damage ticks a second
[2022-12-20 19:33:21] <+savealot2> ranger is the easiest solo imo. place traps to get away, cheese all the mobs
[2022-12-20 19:33:25] <@%ForeverAloneHero> @Sequisha highly recommending airgrill. just made cheese-salami croissants. super cool. have a pic on top
[2022-12-20 19:33:25] <OzymandiasJ> @RalinAura every healing potion "rarity" stacks. if you use the same rarity twice they'll overwrite
[2022-12-20 19:33:26] <%Amebagrinder> Yeah rangers heal is really strong
[2022-12-20 19:33:32] <@%ForeverAloneHero> air-fryer*

[2022-12-20 20:37:52] <%+Malkazzz1> I don't trust free to play. Usually that means your paying through other ways

This value is applied from newly created items.

[2022-12-20 22:41:19] <Baconlitheque> @ins_space and plus it would be far easier to go in naked as a solo, farm some shit in solos likely against other naked solo people and get good gear that you can then in turn use in trios

[2022-12-20 23:57:06] <FynON> So, chat, what's the purpose of dual wield? I feel like you're just losing the speed off both weapons, why not just take those in 2 separate weapon sets? I'm pretty sure I'm missing something

[2022-12-20 23:57:30] <AmaTerasu360> Some Diablo 2hand action
[2022-12-20 23:57:39] <Go420rd> nice 2 handys
[2022-12-20 23:57:41] <@%DamienTheDecoy> @FynON swings faster, and doesn't wave all around so easier to fight in a hallway

[2022-12-20 23:57:46] <Celllie> @FynON dual wielding is basically jsut a disadvantage at this point, apart from being a stat stick

[2022-12-20 23:58:00] <+Eric_Tiberius> i really like the way you take loot back and you  can actually trade it in chat

[2022-12-20 23:59:49] <Celllie> @Faebianna movement speed is big in this game, and you lose a lot by using a 2nd weapon
