[2023-01-07 06:13:44] <!%xrossdelta> 5g and 4g differences not usage
[2023-01-07 06:13:50] <!%xrossdelta> it used more because it loads faster
[2023-01-07 06:14:02] <!%$Entyx__> ye i know
[2023-01-07 06:14:09] <!%xrossdelta> but 5g cost more than 4g
[2023-01-07 06:14:09] <!%MisterMonsieur> YEPYEP how much you load
[2023-01-07 06:14:11] <!%$Entyx__> it sometimes go higher quality for video and stuff

[2023-01-07 11:42:17] <@%Cetkaman> Trangar, i was always wondering about those mice Hmm i dont always cover the entire mouse with my hand so it looks a little uncomfortable for me

[2023-01-07 11:42:33] <!%Trangar> My hands are huuuuge so normal mice are always a bit tiring to use

[2023-01-07 11:44:21] <Nekooooooooo> g502 is still pretty small for me, if i try to palm grip it, fingers go over clickers. i dont like claw grip for the same reason as palm grip, sweaty palms. i cant finger tip grip it because too heavy for my weak fps arms okey
[2023-01-07 11:44:21] <!%Trangar> I bought some cs:go branded mouse a while back and that one has been pretty nice

[2023-01-07 13:11:31] <%seustia> does anyone get turned on by the leg-looking things hanging from Puck's torso? those pale, wrinkled appendages that look like cold chicken wings lathered in leftover jus? imagine getting a footjob from puck and he says "we are in accord" as I cum all over his wrinkly limb sticks. just the thought makes me rock hard.

[2023-01-07 13:18:49] <DoltishMeteor> balls go in the condom Okayge 👍
[2023-01-07 13:18:50] <%$StealthWeeaboo> yeah your balls are where the semen is, a condom not only protects your testicles, but also disables them, so semen wont travel outside of the balls.

[2023-01-07 15:42:43] <%iamanoob> maelstrom rush is basically core on this hero i think theres no better option

[2023-01-07 15:42:50] <%MyCatDanDan> maybe they are simply too good so they do not delay even with falcon blade

[2023-01-07 19:29:13] <%Homeless_Emperor> trolsopol, i feel like our units were playing pinball
[2023-01-07 19:29:20] <%trolsopol> YEPP
[2023-01-07 19:29:22] <%trolsopol> and then EXPLOSION
[2023-01-07 19:29:32] <%trolsopol> i went from 100-35 supply like 5-6 times
[2023-01-07 19:29:41] <%Homeless_Emperor> i couldn't even use my skills
[2023-01-07 19:29:43] <%trolsopol> and i had 35 workers so effectively 0 supply
[2023-01-07 19:30:20] <%trolsopol> this is doable with other commanders, zagara comes to mind or maybe kerax
[2023-01-07 19:30:26] <%trolsopol> cause kerax can spam shit from the sky
[2023-01-07 19:30:28] <%trolsopol> and delete units
[2023-01-07 19:30:55] <%Homeless_Emperor> even weekly mutation nowhere annoying as this KEK
[2023-01-07 19:31:09] <%trolsopol> yeah this was some shit
[2023-01-07 19:31:17] <%trolsopol> also they stole health from our units constantly
[2023-01-07 19:31:22] <%trolsopol> that was the third mutation
[2023-01-07 19:31:35] <%trolsopol> so incase your guys survive on low hp they get leached
[2023-01-07 19:31:36] <%Homeless_Emperor> even my invulnerable medivac gets sucked in ICANT

[2023-01-07 19:32:19] <%trolsopol> ICANT same with dts when omnislash
[2023-01-07 19:32:25] <%trolsopol> they should be invulnerable
[2023-01-07 19:32:27] <%trolsopol> but NOP
[2023-01-07 19:32:32] <%trolsopol> sucky sucky
[2023-01-07 19:32:43] <%trolsopol> hmm not sure
[2023-01-07 19:32:47] <%trolsopol> i should've tried archon
