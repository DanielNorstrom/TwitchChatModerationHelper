[2023-01-04 10:16:55] <@%hatduck_> something about it being cheaper to just make all cars with those features, and charge people who want to use them

[2023-01-04 10:18:23] <@%hatduck_> pay to unlock the top speed
[2023-01-04 10:18:26] <%darkbiacksnow> imagine your sub running out while raining and you can't use the wiper
[2023-01-04 10:18:28] <!Kyyuna> Mercedes is unlocking the last of the top speed
[2023-01-04 10:18:33] <@%hatduck_> i think Tesla already has that?
[2023-01-04 10:18:42] <!Kyyuna> somewhat iirc
[2023-01-04 10:18:45] <@%$Durminon> oh right. Mercedes is ridiculous how much they want

[2023-01-04 10:19:38] <!Kyyuna> among the other computer stuff
[2023-01-04 10:19:41] <@%hatduck_> whats wrong with keyless ignition
[2023-01-04 10:19:46] <@%$Durminon> keyless never made any issues for me
[2023-01-04 10:19:46] <@%hatduck_> my car has keyless ignition
[2023-01-04 10:19:52] <!%Trangar> monkaW
[2023-01-04 10:19:52] <%+2bitplaya> who cares about keyless ignition
[2023-01-04 10:19:53] <!%Trangar> He doesnt' know
[2023-01-04 10:19:57] <!Kyyuna> its just $$$ when you have ot replace it
[2023-01-04 10:20:01] <@%$Durminon> and even if, there is a backup key
[2023-01-04 10:20:03] <@%hatduck_> Death
[2023-01-04 10:20:11] <!%Trangar> Thing with those modules is that you can't fix them, only replace them
[2023-01-04 10:20:16] <@%hatduck_> i have a backup key
[2023-01-04 10:20:19] <@%hatduck_> but the alarm goes off
[2023-01-04 10:20:21] <!%Trangar> If your key ignition works you just get a new cable or something and it's fine
[2023-01-04 10:20:25] <@%hatduck_> if i unlock my car with it
[2023-01-04 10:20:26] <@%hatduck_> Thinkge
[2023-01-04 10:20:31] <%+2bitplaya> not the key, the system that turns the car on. if that breaks down you breaking the bank
[2023-01-04 10:20:50] <!%Trangar> I just want good old hardware
[2023-01-04 10:20:52] <!%Trangar> Less software in my car is better
[2023-01-04 10:20:56] <!Kyyuna> YEPP
[2023-01-04 10:21:01] <@%hatduck_> also, im not sure if my car has a backup ignition thing, in case the push to start doesnt work
[2023-01-04 10:21:04] <%+2bitplaya> Trangar I got your hardware right here Gachi
[2023-01-04 10:21:11] <!%Trangar> OhMyPoggies free car
[2023-01-04 10:21:13] <%darkbiacksnow> there's probably a back up hardware solution
[2023-01-04 10:21:19] <%darkbiacksnow> nobody trust software to work anw
[2023-01-04 10:21:19] <!Kyyuna> you wouldnt download a car Kapp
[2023-01-04 10:21:26] <@%hatduck_> @darkbiacksnow you say that
[2023-01-04 10:21:33] <@%hatduck_> but then u look at a Tesla
[2023-01-04 10:21:35] <@%$Durminon> well, that is like asking what you would do if the power button in your laptop breaks. You can repair it for a bit, but most would just toss it
[2023-01-04 10:21:38] <@%hatduck_> its all touch buttons
[2023-01-04 10:21:43] <%darkbiacksnow> yeah I was about to say too PepeLaf
[2023-01-04 10:21:44] <!Kyyuna> I know theres people using tech to clone keyless fobs to get into your car monkaS
[2023-01-04 10:21:48] <%darkbiacksnow> all of their features are mostly on software
[2023-01-04 10:21:48] <@%hatduck_> like i said before, even unlocking the door is a touch button
[2023-01-04 10:21:49] <@%$Durminon> I would not trust a tesla
[2023-01-04 10:22:07] <%+2bitplaya> hatduck_ you can touch my buttons Gachi
[2023-01-04 10:22:10] <@%hatduck_> @Kyyuna Death i hadnt considered that
[2023-01-04 10:22:13] <%darkbiacksnow> no software engineer trust software to work 100%
[2023-01-04 10:22:15] <!%Trangar> @Durminon I do consider laptops to be horribly unfixable
[2023-01-04 10:22:21] <@%hatduck_> if someone clones my key, my car is ppPoof
[2023-01-04 10:22:24] <!%Trangar> But if your power button in your pc doesn't work you can just fix the one part
[2023-01-04 10:22:25] <%+2bitplaya> Durminon i read that a guy was locked into his tesla while it was burning
[2023-01-04 10:22:39] <!%Trangar> YEPP can't get sued if the person is dead
[2023-01-04 10:22:41] <!Kyyuna> I mean, the odds are unlikely, but at least you dont own a kia in the US

[2023-01-04 10:22:49] <@%hatduck_> @Trangar mine broke
[2023-01-04 10:22:51] <!%Trangar> Aren't kias super safe?
[2023-01-04 10:22:58] <@%$Durminon> @Trangar a power button is quite easy. But that is the point, you can't swap out things anymore
[2023-01-04 10:22:59] <%darkbiacksnow> whats with kias
[2023-01-04 10:23:03] <!%shuraba_> hatduck_ FeelsBirthdayMan
[2023-01-04 10:23:13] <@%hatduck_> when i was cleaning my PC, and pulled out the front panel. the wires inside got detached and the power and reset buttons dont work anymore
[2023-01-04 10:23:24] <!Kyyuna> they have amazing warranties, but some of their recent cars had a major security flaw where you can hotwire the car
[2023-01-04 10:23:30] <!Kyyuna> so people were stealing em in the US KEK
[2023-01-04 10:23:34] <@%$Durminon> just plug it back in 5Head

[2023-01-04 10:23:43] <@%hatduck_> i ordered new switches and use those now, but until i got delivery of those, i had to start my PC by touching the 2 pins on the mobo with a screwdriver tip KEK
[2023-01-04 10:23:47] <%darkbiacksnow> well that actually it, just plug it back in 5Head

[2023-01-04 10:24:20] <@%$Durminon> @Trangar for sure, but think about the money the company looses if they can only sell you a replacement part!
[2023-01-04 10:24:22] <%darkbiacksnow> I would not start my PC taht way KEK
[2023-01-04 10:24:29] <@%hatduck_> MyDemonsHaveFinallyCaughtUpToMe = me without my PC

[2023-01-04 10:24:45] <@%$Durminon> @hatduck_ that is why you always have backups

[2023-01-04 10:25:30] <@%hatduck_> nothing else changed, hardware related
[2023-01-04 10:25:31] <@%$Durminon> "a bit"
[2023-01-04 10:25:33] <%darkbiacksnow> its nice, but its too unstable
[2023-01-04 10:25:40] <@%hatduck_> updated to win 11 and it became so slow and unresponsive
[2023-01-04 10:25:48] <!%Trangar> Unstable? Try using linux for a while PepeLaugh

[2023-01-04 11:09:37] <@%hatduck_> @AcidAnTT so theres quite a few extensions for twitch. if u just want to see the emotes in chat, plus some QoL customizable features, you need only FFZ. inside its settings, under add-ons, you can enable BTTV and 7TV emotes (those are other 2 extensions for emotes)

[2023-01-04 12:36:46] <%nketh> Snapfires phrase "To pay dirt" comes from gold miners in california
[2023-01-04 12:36:48] <%nketh> The miners talk of rich dirt and poor dirt , and of stripping off so many feet of " top dirt " before getting to " pay dirt , " the latter meaning dirt with so much gold in it that it will pay to dig it up and wash it.

Tired and exhausted I open my laptop and go to twitch to watch singsing play dota. I notice he is in a game and I decide to ask “is this ranked?”, but the whole chat starts spamming this stupid PepegaPhone emote instead of answering my question. Fuck you chat and mods, you just lost another loyal viewer and chatter.

[2023-01-04 15:38:19] <morcock> "Nymph" comes from the Greek word "nýmphē" which has the primary meaning of "young woman; bride, young wife", They are often depicted in classic works of fiction. Socially it is used in Nympho as in a person addicted to sex. In Dota however, Nymph is someone who is addicted to throwing. Whether it be weird builds, picking his signature "Treant Mid" you know Agent Nymph is always ready whenever, wherever. Even if its an unlosable game, you can count on Agent noobnymph to find a way nymphSmile

Tired and exhausted I open my laptop and go to twitch to watch singsing play dota. I notice he is in a game and I decide to ask "is this ranked?", but the whole chat starts spamming this stupid PepegaPhone emote instead of answering my question. Fuck you chat and mods, you just lost another loyal viewer and chatter.

[2023-01-04 16:35:16] <morcock> Ouker, also known as Agent O is one of our premier agents. He is really expensive, so most of the time our customers cant afford his services. When he isn't carrying games with his Arc Warden, Pango or Rubick he is in Zen mode playing Jump King for fun. Unfortunately, what makes him lethal in-game makes him even deadlier when he is activated. You get complacent thinking he is gonna carry as usual; and then suddenly you realise you are playing against a Finn stack and its already over. BOGGED
