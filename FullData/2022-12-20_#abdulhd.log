[2022-12-20 03:49:23] <%TheCountyHatter1883> there is no official post-credits scene in God of War Ragnarok per se. Unlike its predecessor, you won't find a proper cinematic at the tail end of this experience to outline where Kratos is heading next.

[2022-12-20 14:11:59] <@%^StreamElements> @legitpoonslayer The Pipe is called Midwakh, and it is used to smoke Dokha. Dokha is a tobacco product, it consists of finely dried and shredded tobacco along with herbs and spices. It also has different levels depending on the person's liking! Badr uses the Hot version which is the strongest.

[2022-12-20 17:08:23] <@%Aresak> Quadratic equations can be quite tough But don't give up, there's no need to huff and puff Just use the quadratic formula to find x It's really not that complex ax^2 + bx + c = 0, that's the equation you see Plug in a, b, and c and solve for x, it's easy (-b +/- sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / (2a), that's the key Two answers, one for plus and one for minus, both could be
[2022-12-20 17:08:24] <@%Aresak> So don't be scared, quadratics can be fun Just use the formula, your work will be done You'll find x in no time, it's really not that hard Quadratic equations, they aren't that bizarre

[2022-12-20 19:33:00] <+packofmisfits> thats if you've already played the story
[2022-12-20 19:33:16] <@%0nlySak> so its "Ghost Of Tsushima Director's Cut improves upon the original by adding proper lip-syncing to the Japanese iteration of the game. The title also comes with subtitles for those who are unable to translate the performances and goes a long way in immersing the player within the story."

Of course, you'll have had to make it to the beginning of Act II on that save."

[2022-12-20 21:08:00] <%+HumousHD> Iconic strawhats in Japan: "In history, hats have multiple functions. One is that it is used as a key fashion item, especially during the earlier times. Another is that it could be used as a means of telling one person’s status in life. There are specific hats used by specific types of people. For instance, the jingasa was used by samurai when traveling or in battle. Then, the ajirogasa is used by traveling monks and lay men."

[2022-12-20 21:22:03] <%+HumousHD> @0nlyPants haha it can be interpreted in different ways. Emotionaly stressing because of the number of times you die but also because of the beauty of the story/characters.

[2022-12-20 21:24:00] <%+HumousHD> @0nlyPants its just as difficult as GoW in my opinion, because the fighting/game mechanics is so in depth. It allows for more flexibility/options on how you take down an enemy.
