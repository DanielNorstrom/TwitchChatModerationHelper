[2022-12-26 09:38:49] <%ProgramMax> that is EXACTLY what I warned StarCraft players about back in the day
[2022-12-26 09:39:00] <+Theydrick> At the same time, some degree of familiarity is always welome
[2022-12-26 09:39:02] <%ProgramMax> if they were only a StarCraft streamer, they would lose money once SC2 loses popularity

[2022-12-26 09:39:34] <%$PixelSkullTank> i only know they did a death note bit. other than that i forgot they were going
[2022-12-26 09:39:47] <%tksi_cu> I mean I just enjoy hearing a person in the background, idk about how others but that's why I put on the stream
[2022-12-26 09:39:47] <Turos_Kensei> Boring, missed its offramp ages ago.
[2022-12-26 09:39:48] <%$MoxieMagician> Rabbit ears stopped working
[2022-12-26 09:39:51] <%+Hashmalla> I stopped watching TV

[2022-12-26 09:39:57] <%lexi_icefox> @poopmonstersupreme being factitious
[2022-12-26 09:40:01] <%k_yama_> i stopped using cable
[2022-12-26 09:40:02] <%$PixelSkullTank> yea i stopped watching tv
[2022-12-26 09:40:06] <Turos_Kensei> Also I don't watch network TV anymore either.
[2022-12-26 09:40:08] <%Rumuwi> apparently the newer seasons have been getting good again but i cant confirm
[2022-12-26 09:40:16] <+truejimbob> Something either has to change it up and stay interesting, or end on a high note
[2022-12-26 09:40:19] <%Shikolti> I mean, some of us never really cared for the Simpsons in the first place so
[2022-12-26 09:40:25] <%lexi_icefox> simpsons stopped being relevant to my interests

[2022-12-26 09:40:47] <%$PixelSkullTank> i stopped watching tv cause i hated sitting through 5-7 minutes of ads. now that craps happening on twitch and other places
[2022-12-26 09:40:49] <%$PixelSkullTank> not fun time
[2022-12-26 09:41:05] <+truejimbob> This game's battle system seems interesting
[2022-12-26 09:41:30] <%Rumuwi> and now everyone and there mother has a streaming service
[2022-12-26 09:41:47] <%k_yama_> i have an issue with netflix style shows. they're more long ass movies, not individual episodes with interconnected plot lines
[2022-12-26 09:41:50] <poopmonstersupreme> yeah like having someone decide what you watch is kinda cringe
[2022-12-26 09:42:04] <%$MoxieMagician> Is it adapting, or is it chasing a trend that cashed out half a decade ago? I canceled all my streaming services but a handful of streamers, and just went back to pirating everything
[2022-12-26 09:42:10] <%Shikolti> picking targets is lame anyway
[2022-12-26 09:42:26] <%$PixelSkullTank> subscription tv and other services and such make my eyes roll to the back of my skull. 99% of the services dont offer anything thats interesting and if it does ill get some other way

[2022-12-26 09:42:39] <%haiddon> binge watching is just hyperfocusing
[2022-12-26 09:43:01] <poopmonstersupreme> yeah pacing yourself is such a weird one but it lets you enjoy more
[2022-12-26 09:43:03] <+truejimbob> Also binge watching doesn't really let cliffhangers sink in as much
[2022-12-26 09:43:10] <%$Heyninja> binge watching just makes me forget the show faster
[2022-12-26 09:43:10] <%$PixelSkullTank> yea, i like waiting for the next episode. if i see a show with alot to watch ill binge it and forget about time and itll be 8 am
[2022-12-26 09:43:15] <%Shikolti> I don't dislike binge watching, but I'll immediately forget like the whole show afterwards
[2022-12-26 09:43:24] <%Rumuwi> gives you something to look forward to
[2022-12-26 09:43:47] <%Noctapus> the only thing I really like about netflix is not seeing ads in the middle of shows
[2022-12-26 09:43:48] <%$Heyninja> mhm waiting for chainsaw man is very exciting
[2022-12-26 09:43:50] <poopmonstersupreme> ngl anime weekly episodes is the only thing that lets me know what day it is

[2022-12-26 09:47:03] <@%+TheVampireZelda> i hate watching streamers that do like ad 1 of 5 i immediately leave
[2022-12-26 09:47:06] <+truejimbob> First death went so hard
[2022-12-26 09:47:19] <Turos_Kensei> If I get an 8 ad pre-roll, I just leave the channel and watch something else.
[2022-12-26 09:47:22] <%+UnlistedNinja> 2-hundred-million-centimeter-long blades is the song. I was just jamming out to it myself
[2022-12-26 09:47:22] <%$Heyninja> songs called 2-hundred-million-centimeter-long blades
[2022-12-26 09:47:32] <%$PixelSkullTank> i leave if i get ads on a stream when i enter
[2022-12-26 09:47:51] <%$Heyninja> twas a banger and i also love the intro song
[2022-12-26 09:47:59] <%+UnlistedNinja> It goes everywhere in the span of like two mins. It's insane
[2022-12-26 09:48:04] <%$MoxieMagician> according to the wiki, burst do weapon damage to targets in the room. Sounds like a buff to me
[2022-12-26 09:48:11] <poopmonstersupreme> it should have the crazy from theme while browsing for guns
[2022-12-26 09:48:17] <%$PixelSkullTank> honestly you could probably find music that would fit this game better as a horror game than the bangers this game has
