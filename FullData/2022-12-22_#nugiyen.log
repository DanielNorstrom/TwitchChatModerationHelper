[2022-12-22 11:10:26] <GrandCleric> Speaking of chatting, I have a quick question. the starter build that I picked had very little info about how to upgrade to end game gear from early, and early gear cant do t14 maps. how do I find out how to upgrade it? each upgrades cost is around 5-6 div.

[2022-12-22 11:15:33] <GIeaming_> From my own experience I usually tend to just use streams as background noise, but I mainly look at personality more so than looking for x or y. But I expect something in a stream where I just wanna chill and hangout

[2022-12-22 11:19:43] <CriErr> did you look into schedule? There times in my following where nobody online only havoc.
[2022-12-22 11:19:48] <+yardsale_eight> It feels like Steel + Ziz have done well this launch, might have pulled from others.  Might have contributed
[2022-12-22 11:20:13] <+bartinobeeferino> Could it just be a micro version of twitch slowing down on the whole?
[2022-12-22 11:20:14] <GrandCleric> @andrew756 skill effects make noise more than other sound sources
[2022-12-22 11:20:30] <GrandCleric> loot filter and such

[2022-12-22 11:21:34] <+treeshark> It's very cookie cutter in terms of play something stable on launch round out the top content then u can be creative imo

[2022-12-22 11:21:36] <%MrBonkeyDollax> @KVahlman yellows? DansGame  The game clearly starts at 100% deli 4 scarabs T16s
[2022-12-22 11:21:48] <+j0zsef> the best you can do is be efficient early, so you can arrive quickly to lategame
[2022-12-22 11:21:59] <+j0zsef> and that's draining
[2022-12-22 11:22:00] <jemoky> true, i just play for meme builds
[2022-12-22 11:22:05] <CriErr> because how ggg balanced stuff, they do not allow weird shit anymore really.
[2022-12-22 11:22:23] <akatosh7> sometimes the crazy builds works to make you popular
[2022-12-22 11:22:23] <GrandCleric> keeping the skill effects volume at low makes sound traffics much less, backgorund is chill but skills blasting blocks it
[2022-12-22 11:22:23] <%+MrVonDutchman> yes often you need a league starter but after a while it gets boring so you never get to the fun builds (for me atleast)

[2022-12-22 11:24:06] <CriErr> yea thats what im saying, i would come out with examples later and show them to you as a point, cant remember any now. Since ive got job at game dev i started noticing a lot in poe that changed.
[2022-12-22 11:24:09] <%+Forenthas> I would love to see some one pick a brand new skill as league starter and try it out but it will end in a mess and nobody wants to see that that so sad
[2022-12-22 11:24:23] <%+MrVonDutchman> i really liked your blade trapper from last league. the whole theorycrafting around it was really fun to watch!

You touched on it, but a lot of the softcore viewership is focused on juicer type streamers, or beginner friendly streamers, whereas any poe fan can enjoy watching a hardcore player engage in risky content
