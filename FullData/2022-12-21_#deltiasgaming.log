[2022-12-21 20:35:38] <@%+brockhoeft1991> delt do you think the warden is the most rounded class in the game. pvp and pve wise? if not which is

[2022-12-21 20:37:35] <@%+brockhoeft1991> I just feel like the warden is top 3 in everything just about
[2022-12-21 20:38:00] <@%+brockhoeft1991> yeah and the change to Artic blast
[2022-12-21 20:38:04] <%PsychoTroop> I gotta say Tanking on the warden is my favorite, but utility wise the necro and DK is better. But warden tanking is my favorite
[2022-12-21 20:38:05] <roginho88> what about betty?
[2022-12-21 20:38:32] <%michaeln89> I don't know what class. I go worth your builds for my stuff. i have 17 characters all different classes and rac3

[2022-12-21 20:38:58] VIEWERS: 688
[2022-12-21 20:39:07] <%PsychoTroop> Its the healing aspect, other tanks its max mitigation and taking less damage while , the warden just eats damage and heals it all. I love healing incoming damage then just getting hit not as hard
[2022-12-21 20:39:14] <!%nyxenwhite> Putting tri res sustain glyphs on jewelry with sustain CP passives makes night and day for the warden

[2022-12-21 20:39:40] <@%+brockhoeft1991> @michaeln89  can't go wrong with a dk tank and a warden healer. if you just trying to content but not the hardest content the warden

[2022-12-21 20:40:28] <%PsychoTroop> Warden use to be the sought after OT’s but then Warden healer became way more main stream so not many people look for warden tanks anymore delOld

It’s cool they wanted to be more inclusive for casual and newer players. It’s just a difficult thing to adapt to knowing a lot of end game players still have a bad taste in their mouths.

[2022-12-21 21:12:07] <%AZN_Synik> @deltiasgaming I get what you’re saying with your feelings on Destiny 2, for me I don’t think I can do anything other than min/max theory craft if I come back to ESO. I get that PvP and PvE meta is straightforward, but I can’t run too many off builds in PvP without getting steamrolled or stalemating

[2022-12-21 21:13:48] <Beastlymanx> i love ESO. I haven't played in awhile but i always come back to it
[2022-12-21 21:13:58] <Beastlymanx> what character are you playing right now?
[2022-12-21 21:14:16] <manaholik> can i recommend yall an audiobook i got recommended?
[2022-12-21 21:14:31] <%AZN_Synik> Like I’m really trying to power through because I do genuinely love ESO, I guess im just finding it difficult to adapt with the kind of characters I want to create
[2022-12-21 21:14:43] <manaholik> i might've spammed it before.  im halfway thru the 5th book.  really helped me with the grind
[2022-12-21 21:14:50] <Beastlymanx> i've been out of touch with what's going on with the game. what's causing the frustrations?
[2022-12-21 21:14:53] <%michaeln89> it's just a game. if will always change
[2022-12-21 21:14:57] <%+ragtor> BTW is anyone on PC NA able to craft me a setup for when i hit CP10? Some heartland/twice-born will pay gold for it ofc delLove

[2022-12-21 21:19:42] <%$Adzer2> I'm just burned out from ESO at the moment, the High Isle/Galen story was OK but lacked substance, I've moved to a few single players for a while
[2022-12-21 21:19:43] <%+TheBarkMan> @ams_ii LUL

[2022-12-21 21:19:48] <%AZN_Synik> Yeah Destiny has the same cyclical problem as ESO, but Destiny also has an over abundance of cheaters in PvP. ESO has the combat I wish all MMOs would have, but it also changes to drastically so often with metas and what’s good.
[2022-12-21 21:20:17] <manaholik> saw it. oh wow.

[2022-12-21 22:06:24] <themrgeorge300> would you recommend me to farm that build or go for the 2 bar builds for pvp?
[2022-12-21 22:06:33] <@%+brockhoeft1991> u want dk, healer plar or magden?
[2022-12-21 22:06:42] <LifeAblaze> Hey deltia,  I had to walk away from eso,  I can’t stand the hybrid push, my mag builds are all instantly outstripped by the hybrid builds, everyone running the same weapons these days.  Feels like there’s no variety in the play styles.
[2022-12-21 22:06:57] <@%+brockhoeft1991> zos break there silence, check out delts break down https://youtu.be/U73AIIEytR4
[2022-12-21 22:07:41] <%D_I_X_0_N> they should make faction change tokens buyable with ap factions are mainly pvp anyways and i thinbk it would bring more players to cyro

[2022-12-21 22:49:30] <disflippant> The last way to squeeze money out of the lemon is to widen the audience that is willing to suck on it. They have to make the game more accessible. It's economics. That doesn't mean the game isn't fun and worth playing- it's just harder to be 'hardcore' in.
