[2022-12-10 06:40:26] <%+AoiWaffles> @CrxnT It does tier 0 damage late game, but only a specific build. That certain build leeches synergy rather than provide it

[2022-12-10 06:41:59] <%$Kilua87> @crxnt the build that does more damage, gives less synergy uptime

[2022-12-10 06:42:24] <%+AoiWaffles> @CrxnT So right the buff bot WD we all love is First Intention WD. The tier 0 damage build is full spec Entropy Esoteric. Also requires max Lazenith and Umar card set
[2022-12-10 06:42:48] <%+AoiWaffles> @CrxnT Tier 0 damage build only buffs for themselves and it is very low uptime like Striker

[2022-12-10 09:18:21] <%+SignGain> spec is good for static groups in discord to skip mechs but overall swift is better dps throughout the fight

[2022-12-10 12:42:49] <%+AoiWaffles> @SataMaz Then spec arti is better but you'd prob would be forced out of wheelchair often because he has a one shot pattern

[2022-12-10 13:14:00] <%$Nil2434> @Nil2434 its pretty obvious in clown. Not so much for vykas or valtan.

[2022-12-10 13:14:19] <%+lucyfer_ek> i like vykas
[2022-12-10 13:14:22] <%$Nil2434> Even if you are the best player in the world playing consistent dps class in clown, you cant outdps an average burst class.
[2022-12-10 13:14:25] <%+NicuLove> @Nil2434 because in vykas or valtan you cannot skip mechs PepeLaugh

[2022-12-10 13:16:55] <%+AoiWaffles> @Nil2434 Nah burst classes still shine by a long shot in bingo, since that's when supps drops all their buffs. Consistent dps classes cannot utilize it as well as burst can
[2022-12-10 13:17:10] <%$Nil2434> AT is spec. Its more burst.
[2022-12-10 13:17:17] <+imnotvocal> AT is crit
