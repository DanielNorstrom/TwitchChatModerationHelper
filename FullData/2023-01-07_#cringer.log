[2023-01-07 17:05:33] <PeaceMonkeyV5> In most Japanese cities (like Tokyo) streets actually don't have names, except for major ones like highways. As addresses they instead number the city blocks. In newer areas they sometimes name intersections for orientation after nearby locations, but those names are not used for official adresses, etc.
