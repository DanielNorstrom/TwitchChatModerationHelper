[2022-12-15 17:05:32] <Niromania> what's the win condition of this deck beside bottomRight Despairge
[2022-12-15 17:05:39] <%rakanishu_21> KEKL win con
[2022-12-15 17:05:46] <Roff3l_> @Niromania how about quest?
[2022-12-15 17:05:53] <%Lukec444> !wincon
[2022-12-15 17:05:54] <^StreamElements> And if you're looking for a "win condition" by looking for cards that say "Win the game.", I think that's setting yourself up for disappointment. Rather, there's several ways that Priest can win games; high value control, healing synergies, big minions, Rally stuff, etc.
[2022-12-15 17:05:56] <%yoavsnake> @Roff3l_ yes but what's the wincon
[2022-12-15 17:06:16] <Niromania> @Roff3l_ draw 3 cards doesn't win you game Despairge
