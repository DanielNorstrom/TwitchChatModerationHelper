[2022-12-09 14:19:56] <%+Kittyhavoc> Hob was the champion of souls and he's grown past it, almost everyone will be there, you can't play the same videogame forever
[2022-12-09 14:19:59] <%painkiller752> at one point you are just done with a genre

[2022-12-09 14:24:52] <!%+Megantron> Did you try anything else?
[2022-12-09 14:24:56] <+Skarr94> Twitch is a heißes Pflaster
[2022-12-09 14:24:56] <+ecstasy_in_service> he likes playing WZ and splitting his attention means his runs are less consistent, honestly dropping DS games till he wants to focus on them is not a bad idea
[2022-12-09 14:25:14] <%Killionaire_OG> cod is addicting

[2022-12-09 14:25:58] <%Dooglie> TurtleArmyJess oh really? LULW Is it actually fun? Laker brought it up one day on stream
[2022-12-09 14:25:59] <%FapFapEZClap> been watching Hob for 4 years... ive always watched him cause he's entertaining not cause of the games he plays... he can find success with whatever i feel
[2022-12-09 14:26:01] <%tommyf091> Many streamer ignore the viewer count while they stream because it would ruin their mood

[2022-12-09 14:26:41] <%TheBadgi> In fairness, this community is fun and wholesome. I think it will grow, even if it is slow going sometimes
[2022-12-09 14:26:42] <%$dain_sounds> Nico you are a great entertainer and variety will fit you perfectly for a lot of memes and new stuff

[2022-12-09 14:27:18] <%$Baryon23> @dinossindgeil hypothetically, for a growing streamer do you think it's better to do some variety early so that people come to expect it? or just stick to the core content

[2022-12-09 14:28:12] <%TheBadgi> @Baryon23 I would think that "start as you mean to go on" applies. You're always going to see a drop in numbers when you change it up.

[2022-12-09 15:08:12] <@%a_chu> @Ixdex1 Also,Hades and Zeus were syncretised at that time so to properly divide the gods later they probably added that LULW So saying she is Hades' daughter is not enirely wrong either
[2022-12-09 15:08:26] <%MicolashTV> perfected your quickstep already i hope!

[2022-12-09 16:06:08] <%+Soad3821> yep, I've played Divinity 2 for ~500 hours
[2022-12-09 16:06:08] <%CaptainUncomfortable> you should take your birthday off to deny chat the ability to say happy birthday legitimately for once.

[2022-12-09 16:08:09] <%just_some_pvp> i messed with bg3 early acess when it first started  and just the lil bit i got gave me alot of faith it was gonna be good when they finish it

[2022-12-09 17:03:51] <!%noxifoxi> @deputydangle24 I don't agree with that, in my opinion the overall animations in ER are better, just the boss fight cutscenes are out of sync with the camera pan
[2022-12-09 17:03:57] <%Ancillius> @nemo_76 if it is interesting for you.. the monmthly contract also means, that you as a strimmer cant change the ad settings for this month.

[2022-12-09 17:06:04] <%+nemo_76> my favorite hot take from last night was someone saying "Some random kid made more announcements than Microsoft" lol
[2022-12-09 17:06:15] <Async_7> yea i wonder how Armor core games are.
[2022-12-09 17:06:15] <katjers> One would imagine that, yes...

[2022-12-09 17:10:46] <%ValhallaOutcast> I think step one is have the normal people in a seperate section of audience not mixed in with the nominees
[2022-12-09 17:11:00] <YaFOOOOOOOOOL> GOW winning so many award then Elden ring wins GOTY seemed odd. and was GOWR really deserving of all those awards (genuinely asking. I'm getting it for Xmas)

[2022-12-09 17:13:23] <%Narcodina> stray was....decent
[2022-12-09 17:13:26] <YaFOOOOOOOOOL> @a_chu ahh ok. as long as the awards are truly deserved I have no issue. just so hard to know when leading up to the game awards there's all this talk about rigging the votes and bots
[2022-12-09 17:13:27] <%Ancillius> Well as far as I can read the kid got arrested. Idk if it was worth it.. but if you sneak into a certain area especially as a kid you might be easily overlooked and since the kid was very confident so that he might have fooled the officials.
[2022-12-09 17:13:28] <%reformedorthodoxrabbi> i wanted vampires suviors to win

[2022-12-09 17:20:31] <%Ancillius> So many games are currently releasing... its pure horror... i cannot play em all at one!!! whyyyy?
[2022-12-09 17:20:34] <%+TheCarson> I'm really scared that Starfield is just going to feel like a No Man's Sky DLC
[2022-12-09 17:20:49] <%Emian375> Ymfah is a GIGACHAD
[2022-12-09 17:20:55] <%aredmongoose> @a_chu Yeah, it's the first chapter. I've been playing it on and off since they released/updated it.
[2022-12-09 17:20:59] <%+GumboTorte> maybe they release the DLC for elden ring when they release the GOTY Elden ring Edition/Patch
[2022-12-09 17:21:03] <%deputydangle24> @thecarson true but if they finish it they can put their resources back into fallout
[2022-12-09 17:21:10] <%+TheCarson> @deputydangle24 Agreed
[2022-12-09 17:21:21] <%cuber1717> lego star wars, and meat boy 2, and the cuphead dlc have come out already, where is silksong peepoSad
[2022-12-09 17:21:25] <@%a_chu> @a_chu yeah, I really want to try it out, even if it might be buggy. I usually love games like that very much

[2022-12-09 17:32:59] <%aredmongoose> I assume ads are based on region of watcher, not streamer
[2022-12-09 17:33:02] <%Eidoiruson> They probably have some basic targeting based on location
[2022-12-09 17:33:03] <%$dennybur> @TurtleArmyJess kazoodWave great job on the armored version if you didn't see that earlier peepoHappy
[2022-12-09 17:33:14] <%CaptainUncomfortable> It just comes down to the IP of the viewer
[2022-12-09 17:33:15] <%Ancillius> Usually you base Ad Choices (if any) on the user, not on the strimmer.. thats at least the usual business solution.

[2022-12-09 17:34:17] <%+Gosfi> @dennybur cats also never became fully domesticated like dogs were, that's why we say they're assholes, camels, horses, dogs and the various farm animals are all very docile towards humans (of course accidents can happen with every animal and they can hurt us) because their brains have been rewired to see us as a more likely chance for survival than going in the wild

[2022-12-09 17:50:59] <%+Stavit2> @dennybur It's completely nonsensical. Orthodox and Reformed rabbis are on the opposite spectrum of Judaism. There's no such thing as a reformed orthodox rabbi. Besides that Bill Clinton isn't even jewish AFAIK. and the guy was wearing Yeezies which makes me think the whole thing is a juvenile prank.

[2022-12-09 17:57:48] <%+TheCarson> @8_Bit_Chad I think its the same reason people care about their favorite teams winning the championship
[2022-12-09 17:57:50] <nosferatu616> if stray can get nominated for GOTY then hades can too
[2022-12-09 17:57:50] <%drhendrix1> It Takes Two
[2022-12-09 17:57:54] <%mbx220> it takes two
[2022-12-09 17:57:55] <%drhendrix1> last year
[2022-12-09 17:57:55] <+ZiggsSawPuzzle> i thought elden ring was gonna be niche cuz of how much god of war swept
[2022-12-09 17:57:56] <@%a_chu> it takes two or so?
[2022-12-09 17:57:56] <%Lovenewton98> it takes two was niche-ish
[2022-12-09 17:57:57] <taftusimus> Hades was nomminated for the GOTY last year
[2022-12-09 17:57:57] <siilk13> hollow knight?
[2022-12-09 17:57:58] <%$dennybur> i mean It Takes Two was pretty niche
[2022-12-09 17:57:58] <@%a_chu> was recently
[2022-12-09 17:57:59] <%drhendrix1> lolololol

[2022-12-09 17:58:22] <%Hornypotsmoker> yea indie games win things like Best Song or at most Best Indie
[2022-12-09 17:58:22] <%bing0pajamas> I think the skeleton had a noticeable boner
[2022-12-09 17:58:31] <Ixdex1> art, direction and goty
[2022-12-09 17:58:31] <taftusimus> Hades only Lost GOTY award because that year another AAA title got it

[2022-12-09 17:58:32] <%AsherCanid> Boned
[2022-12-09 17:58:37] <%thefifthmatt> I can't really complain about any of the award outcomes. seems like it ended up being a good mix of good games
[2022-12-09 17:58:37] <+ZiggsSawPuzzle> should've won score too
[2022-12-09 17:58:38] <old_raspy> Yeah and director, GoW got the most noms but fewer major wins
[2022-12-09 17:58:41] <%+moosemaster17> did celeste win anything? i loved that game sm
[2022-12-09 17:58:47] <%haihighku> Last time I walked in to a window shop I screamed. I couldn't help it, I was in a lot of pane
[2022-12-09 17:58:49] <%bartyboyk> I think dS3 is prettier than elden ring
[2022-12-09 17:58:52] <%$dennybur> @Stavit2 did you know that there is a spooky skeleton inside of you right now?
[2022-12-09 17:58:55] <%$originalgengar> earthblade
[2022-12-09 17:58:57] <%Hornypotsmoker> makers of celeste
[2022-12-09 17:58:58] <taftusimus> I want Hades 2 to win Game awards so it'll sell more
[2022-12-09 17:58:58] <%+8_Bit_Chad> @TheCarson I don't think that's quite the same. The objective in sports is winning. The objective in gaming is to create experiences people enjoyed
[2022-12-09 17:58:59] <%drhendrix1> earth blade?
[2022-12-09 17:59:00] <%Hornypotsmoker> Earthblade
[2022-12-09 17:59:04] <julianwhelanalt> @hornypotsmoker it woulda been nice if elden ring won but I’m glad they showed appreciation towards our reformed rabbi

[2022-12-09 17:59:22] <old_raspy> Looks like Celeste as Hollow Knight
[2022-12-09 17:59:22] <%MrNinja1234> celeste is one of my favorite games of all time
[2022-12-09 17:59:22] <Mendovo> its a metrodvania i believe
[2022-12-09 17:59:24] <%MrNinja1234> !song
[2022-12-09 17:59:24] <%+Gosfi> it takes two is what we used to classify as a double A game in the mid 2000's a game that has a medium budget and is backed by a big publisher, so I wouldn't call it an indie game
[2022-12-09 17:59:25] <%+TheCarson> @8_Bit_Chad Yeah I don't know...I'm not a sports guy, can't relate to it.
