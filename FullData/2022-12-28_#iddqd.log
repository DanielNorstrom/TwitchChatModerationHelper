[2022-12-28 09:40:07] <CHICKEN2XD> Ramattra mirror or hog is best against ramattra imo
[2022-12-28 09:40:11] <%+Lifeonfire22> lol no he punches through shields

[2022-12-28 09:40:39] <OrderOfTheWaffledog> i'm with lhcloudy on this
[2022-12-28 09:40:39] <ilmianso> Ramattra's E slightly reduces FOV and it drives me crazy
[2022-12-28 09:40:50] <fatguy925> Ramatarra can punch threw shields to rein just out tanks and hammers him.
[2022-12-28 09:40:58] <normalpills> owch

[2022-12-28 09:41:26] <OrderOfTheWaffledog> ramattra doesnt do enough damage to kill rein

[2022-12-28 09:42:29] <fatguy925> @CHICKEN2XD close range, Rein hammers him to death, and with a lot of potions, ramatarra can't counter
[2022-12-28 09:42:29] <%sherwin_fernandes> is this the main acc or the other one
[2022-12-28 09:42:36] <garbanzero> @normalpills tru its just the dairy free version
[2022-12-28 09:42:41] <%FusedIon> @garbanzero also btw if you want a "fine" cheap backup, you could get powdered milk
[2022-12-28 09:42:41] <OrderOfTheWaffledog> you force ram to fight you as rein, and because ram can't outdamage rein he loses
[2022-12-28 09:42:43] <%MusketNBeer> alter i think

[2022-12-28 09:43:06] <CHICKEN2XD> Water and cereal sounds bad because water does not have it’s own taste. Otherwise it’s absolutely not bad
[2022-12-28 09:43:10] <%Smacky20> his ult monkaGIGA
[2022-12-28 09:43:10] <fatguy925> A lot of times, Rein shouldn't use shield
[2022-12-28 09:43:11] <garbanzero> @fusedion but waters cheaper
[2022-12-28 09:43:12] <%burbous> infinite if he's doing dmg
[2022-12-28 09:43:21] <guizhito> for the duration of the nemesis

[2022-12-28 09:43:36] <+agassparkle> duration of the ult
[2022-12-28 09:43:40] <sacro9> infinite

[2022-12-28 09:43:43] <shruggy08> he can hold the block

[2022-12-28 09:43:55] VIEWERS: 1 391
[2022-12-28 09:43:56] <Phunkadeliic> He is balanced
[2022-12-28 09:44:01] <Dracksar> block doesnt have a cooldown
[2022-12-28 09:44:02] <%+johnlemon1995> that is his rigth klick
[2022-12-28 09:44:09] <sacro9> as long as ult is up

[2022-12-28 09:44:11] <%keroziner3> if ult is infinite he can keep his defensive form for an infinite amount of time too. if hes not ulting its just 7 seconds tho
[2022-12-28 09:44:17] <CHICKEN2XD> @orderofthewaffledog ram has 675 hp, and his punches can outrange your hammer btw- so if he moves back he can hit you but you can’t.
[2022-12-28 09:44:18] <garbanzero> 3 sec if nobodys in it
[2022-12-28 09:44:19] <fatguy925> Aslong as ulti us up, usually tank is supposed charge AYAYA
[2022-12-28 09:44:19] <shruggy08> yes with his ult and if he's taking damage or doing damage with those lines infinite
[2022-12-28 09:44:22] <%+sliime69420> thats ramatra
[2022-12-28 09:44:23] <zomafollower> no cooldown in nemesis form, as long as he wants

[2022-12-28 09:44:44] <+agassparkle> in ult it is
[2022-12-28 09:44:44] <saghzs> as long as someone is in range, yes
[2022-12-28 09:44:44] <Dracksar> yea
[2022-12-28 09:44:44] <ilmianso> Yes he can
[2022-12-28 09:44:45] <%sherwin_fernandes> 7 sec
[2022-12-28 09:44:46] <zomafollower> yes
[2022-12-28 09:44:46] <+labrat32> You can block as long as he's in Nem form, yeah
[2022-12-28 09:44:47] <%keroziner3> im 99% sure yes
[2022-12-28 09:44:48] <%MusketNBeer> yes?
[2022-12-28 09:44:48] <kuroikyu> Yeah, you just right click
[2022-12-28 09:44:48] <sudden_ow> sure can
[2022-12-28 09:44:49] <%+Lifeonfire22> Only with the ult active

[2022-12-28 09:44:54] <%+sliime69420> so this vod is silver 4
[2022-12-28 09:44:54] <%deansmithereens> yerp
[2022-12-28 09:44:55] <+labrat32> Nem form has a duration, though
[2022-12-28 09:44:57] <+weetgeenhenk> @iddqd yeah... haven't you seen 2 ramatra's do it to each other? its infinite
[2022-12-28 09:44:58] <shruggy08> yes if he's taking damage or doing damage in ult @iddqd
[2022-12-28 09:45:00] <MusketNBeer> when he ults he can hold the tanky big man
[2022-12-28 09:45:02] <OrderOfTheWaffledog> @CHICKEN2XD ram do not have 675 hp
[2022-12-28 09:45:02] <%Smacky20> Yeah that ult requires the tank mode
[2022-12-28 09:45:04] <Dracksar> as long as he is in ult he can block whenever he wants to for as long as he wants to
[2022-12-28 09:45:05] <reagan__> no way monkaMEGA
[2022-12-28 09:45:06] <%deansmithereens> and takes literally no damage from the front
[2022-12-28 09:45:07] <zomafollower> no cap yes he can
[2022-12-28 09:45:08] <+Malificarum> Theoretically
[2022-12-28 09:45:09] <%burbous> oh yeah if he's not in ult its 8 sec, i ult its infinite
[2022-12-28 09:45:14] <normalpills> only when in nemesis form which lasts for only 8 seconds
[2022-12-28 09:45:22] <%FusedIon> not nonstop, but within the nemisis form its unrestricted
[2022-12-28 09:45:28] <saghzs> thats why 2 ramattras staring each other down with their ults is so funny KEKW
[2022-12-28 09:45:31] <%keroziner3> because they can only do that while ulting
[2022-12-28 09:45:31] <ilmianso> Because if he has no armor he blocks very little damage
[2022-12-28 09:45:32] <CHICKEN2XD> @orderofthewaffledog wot, he does in nemesis form lol
[2022-12-28 09:45:36] <fatguy925> Other ramatarras try running forward to keep people into the ultui
[2022-12-28 09:45:39] <Curxis> cause you need to be constantly healed
[2022-12-28 09:45:39] <zomafollower> slows you down
[2022-12-28 09:45:42] <shruggy08> because people stop shooting i thought
[2022-12-28 09:45:42] <%+Lifeonfire22> If you leave the ult radius it ends
[2022-12-28 09:45:44] <%MusketNBeer> only works on ults
[2022-12-28 09:45:47] <OrderOfTheWaffledog> @CHICKEN2XD that's my point

[2022-12-28 10:55:59] <%NuggyLife> It’s why I don’t talk in game unless I have a friend with me or my teammates actually sound nice

[2022-12-28 10:57:41] <chokondix> @iddqd dont apologize, it has to be said
[2022-12-28 10:57:56] <%MidnightDatura> OW is so toxic...
[2022-12-28 10:58:00] <%MidnightDatura> i love this game but man
[2022-12-28 10:58:08] <%+toadgurt> @hijinks blizz doesnt do anything ab reports either so theyre just allowed to run rampant lol
[2022-12-28 10:58:15] <%MidnightDatura> i mean, some people in OW
[2022-12-28 10:58:16] <+elendr4s> @MidnightDatura its not only ow sadly
[2022-12-28 10:58:23] VIEWERS: 1 674
[2022-12-28 10:58:31] <%fawtetaa> honestly ow is much more toxic than valorant for example
[2022-12-28 10:58:32] <%+toadgurt> we appreciate you calling out ppl on their bullshit like that
[2022-12-28 10:58:37] <%MidnightDatura> I know
[2022-12-28 10:58:37] <@%Oshleyy> the internet is toxic
[2022-12-28 10:58:38] <Vorkender> it is mostly the gaming community which is toxic
[2022-12-28 10:58:40] <%hijinks> @toadgurt You're right, they don't lol. I have friends who have submitted whole clips and vod highlights and it was still ignored.
[2022-12-28 10:58:46] <winskill06> my fav OW comp quote is "where are the heals" when you lose 1st fight. Its always somone elses fault, never look at thier own gameplay
[2022-12-28 10:58:57] <%AytenOne> breaking news ow is only a reflection of our society :3
[2022-12-28 10:59:01] <%Bulletproof_santa> every pvp game or online game is toxic now
[2022-12-28 10:59:16] <%+toadgurt> @hijinks yea, sad that we cant simply play a game without having our lives threatened
[2022-12-28 10:59:18] <%Friedolf> iddSus Genji is the answer
[2022-12-28 10:59:29] <%+hajdzik> I think it's that young people have trouble dealing with their emotions and need to bully someone on the Internets
[2022-12-28 10:59:30] <%MidnightDatura> Oh I know... especially for us women... it's HELL
[2022-12-28 10:59:31] <%hijinks> @Vorkender This isn't a "It's a gamer thing" issue. I can play plenty of multiplayer games without getting any toxicity that would rival what happens if I play overwatch and talk.
[2022-12-28 10:59:41] <Vorkender> people who try to find refuge in the internet, most of them have a reason to behave like a jerk... having a reason to do so doesnt mean that it is excused though
[2022-12-28 10:59:52] <Skitttlesx> @winskill06 So true!!
[2022-12-28 10:59:53] <%+Nightsy> name one game with a comp scene thats not toxic

[2022-12-28 11:00:31] <bros123456> do you think its a newwer developement? oing backl to the thing about "hating is a trend now" thing. Or was it always this shit? Dont remember it being this serious 10 years ago tbh
[2022-12-28 11:00:43] <Sephuku> people are toxic on competitive videogames because they mostly have nothing going on in life besides being good at it
[2022-12-28 11:00:45] <%+Lulily> Thankfully my main game doesn't have VC so I can play ranked without that worry, but even having a feminine name can get you flamed sometimes.
[2022-12-28 11:00:48] <winskill06> im all for trying to help people in this game and improve but people just want to flame
[2022-12-28 11:00:51] <@%Oshleyy> people have always been toxic, it's not new
[2022-12-28 11:00:56] <Sephuku> so whenever they lose they take it personally
[2022-12-28 11:01:15] <%+toadgurt> competitive games def feel way more toxic nowadays
[2022-12-28 11:01:20] <Zeirem> PepeLaugh
[2022-12-28 11:01:21] <@%daisy82078> AAAA
[2022-12-28 11:01:43] <brokenbeachchair> As a new ow player just know pretty much every fps is more toxic. Ow people are chill
[2022-12-28 11:01:47] <%MidnightDatura> that tracer got RAILED
[2022-12-28 11:01:48] <Vorkender> being F2P also increases the toxicity imo

[2022-12-28 14:01:38] <tirdni> @bros123456 I was a little pleb and couldn't finish Doom at my current age. So my father would put a little note on the left side of the screen. "Press §, write IDDQD". What does iddqd mean? This is a cheat code that would make you invincible in the game and inevitably make me finish it. This is such a fond memory to me so I decided to keep it close with me and use it as a nickname.
