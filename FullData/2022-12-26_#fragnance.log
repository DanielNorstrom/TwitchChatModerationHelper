[2022-12-26 16:41:25] <%+Misasam> @iluvmycatxo no real choice if it is your "work" or "income"
[2022-12-26 16:42:25] <iluvmycatxo> @misasam idk, seems irrelevant at this point, the main guilds theyre competing with took a break like bdgg, whats the point at this stage then
[2022-12-26 16:42:42] <iluvmycatxo> We got 3rd because everyone else stopped raiding
[2022-12-26 16:42:52] <iluvmycatxo> Idk maybe im delusional
[2022-12-26 16:43:00] VIEWERS: 974
[2022-12-26 16:43:14] <%+Misasam> you could also say they got 2nd coz liquid stopped. in the end they got 2nd.. and they maybe will get 3rd. nobody asks how they got it
[2022-12-26 16:43:16] <%+Misasam> in 2-3years
[2022-12-26 16:44:40] <iluvmycatxo> @misasam i mean to this day its kinda still talked about that they got second bc liquid didnt play idk. Isnt it you either get 1st or you lose?
[2022-12-26 16:45:00] VIEWERS: 974
[2022-12-26 16:45:38] <%+Misasam> not really. since method isn't competing for #1 yet (fully). liquid and echo are still ahead in that point. but for method its like stabilizing the 3rd spot behind them.. to them grow bigger and compete with them in maybe 1 or 2 tiers
[2022-12-26 16:46:07] <iluvmycatxo> @misasam and i mean i would get it if they were to kill like on xmas day or smthing but this modt likely isnt going to die until reset so idk, not worth at all imo

[2022-12-26 16:47:34] <firewavex> I assume it's due to sponsors and funding etc. Easier to advertise yourself as #3
