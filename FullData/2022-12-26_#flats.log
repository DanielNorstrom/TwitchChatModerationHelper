Flats flattened the kid with his 6ft body, thus earning him the nickname "Flats" since "Flatten" sounds stupid.

[2022-12-26 01:39:16] <@%^StreamElements> When Flats was in high school he joined the football team. Within his first week there, someone else on the team ended up crossing a line and pissing Flats off. Flats flattened the kid with his 6ft body, thus earning him the nickname "Flats" since "Flatten" sounds stupid.

[2022-12-26 02:28:10] <%SS_Zero> @supersayzin the reason it's called C9 is because that was the name of a pro team that did that I think in Overwatch League or Contenders, so everyone calls it c9 when you forget to get on objective lol

[2022-12-26 18:23:00] <CooLitten> @some5one genji becomes a support character
[2022-12-26 18:23:04] <%NOTEQU4L> drops are still delayed?
[2022-12-26 18:23:05] <%Violet_Ashes> Genji is getting all the nerfs. The only he hasn't gotten yet is being removed from the game for 3 weeks cause of a bug
[2022-12-26 18:23:08] <%SkitzoCTRL> @Flats If the game was changed back to 6v6 and the tanks balanced around it, what do you think the tank meta might be? Zarya/JQ seems like it would be a very strong brawl comp.

[2022-12-26 19:00:00] <%cashschmear> I have played Overwatch 2 for the last 10 years, and today I'm finally putting my foot down. For a whole decade, I have dealt with the most unbalanced, one-sided characters. The meta hasn't changed for years. The solution has been staring the devs in the face, but they refuse to do it. It's finally time to rise up and say it together: nerf Genji.

[2022-12-26 19:49:01] <%xoCakepop> Cheer245 Flats, I’m really surprised at the lack of people wishing you a “happy birthday” in chat. Did chat forget that was today? Are they too focused on drops?! Be sure to wish the streamer a happy birthday, it’s the big 3 0! We are so proud of our streamer. I think this calls for 30 gifted.

[2022-12-26 20:14:38] <calamityProphet> @arakron02 as a bronze 5 moira, if you want my adivce, most of what I can share is: (1) use fade sparingly, try not to use it unless you know you can get to safety with it, don't waste it if you aren't going to die, (2) learning how to bounce orbs on walls/floors to keep them in place or to do trickshots to reach people not in LOS is CRUCIAL

[2022-12-26 20:14:49] <%SynnfullySweet> @arakron02 with orbs try to ricochet the damage orbs off walls towards enemies. always save the big healing ball for teammates. use succ hand to do damage while also recharging ur heal spray meter. oh and her ult heals n damages. I use it in back line to heal my team directly in front of me while also pushing for space

[2022-12-26 21:19:45] <%SkitzoCTRL> @theogshadowzer Early Symmetra's left click was like Moira's right click, she had 6 turrets instead of 3, she had a projected barrier that was kind of like Sigma's but you couldn't stop, and her ultimate either gave a teleporter from spawn directly to where you wanted it or dropped a shield generator that gave everybody on your team an additional shield.
