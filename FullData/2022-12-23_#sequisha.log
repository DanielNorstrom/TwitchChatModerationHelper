[2022-12-23 00:50:08] <MineBorder> @psykdileva i think the game will prioritize solo lobbies if you are solo, if not then next update

[2022-12-23 00:50:30] <Richie364> @MineBorder it doesnt, the game is balanced for 3v3

[2022-12-23 00:50:38] <+pnwrat> @psykdileva they already said they dont want solo lobbies to be a thing unless a last resort. doesn't seem a priority
[2022-12-23 00:50:58] <%+LusciousTigerAss> JackBlaque i could tell what kinda cooked he was talkin about CiGrip
[2022-12-23 00:51:03] <AdamJamez> they said they might do solo lobbies depending on how people feel and after theyve tried everything else to balance it
[2022-12-23 00:51:04] <Mongbat25> surely someone got us sxome heals 🤔
[2022-12-23 00:51:06] <ManiakMartin> @psykdileva in their discord they discussed the game is being built around group gameplay, if they added solo it would majorly unbalanced. which i agree with lol
[2022-12-23 00:51:14] <%JackBlaque> @LusciousTigerAss yeah, that's the joke
[2022-12-23 00:51:16] <Richie364> @psykdileva which is a crazy thing to say, its just asking for a review bomb upon EA/launch
[2022-12-23 00:51:18] <%+LusciousTigerAss> i like the kill feed

[2022-12-23 00:51:54] <AdamJamez> @ManiakMartin theres alot more solo players then not and these devs listen so chances are solo lobbies end up in the game or they buff solos somehow

[2022-12-23 00:52:33] <%taz_bruh> No one has yet made a good argument as to why allowing solos to que into the game with groups
[2022-12-23 00:52:41] <+swoleacw> Ok
[2022-12-23 00:52:41] <%taz_bruh> would be a bad thing

[2022-12-23 00:58:09] <%+LusciousTigerAss> id like tos ee the devs work on squad fill before trying to make a solo queue, along with balancing it for that.
[2022-12-23 00:58:55] <AdamJamez> dont see any reason why not to add solo queues so people that want to solo can and people that want to trio can like every other game
[2022-12-23 00:59:05] <%JackBlaque> problem with solo queues, everyone wants them, and then they just team when they get them
[2022-12-23 00:59:05] <%+ZayneD420> we are just as likely to see solo lobbies in DnD as we are in Tarkov, i dont see it

[2022-12-23 00:59:21] <Richie364> @AdamJamez because in low pop games it fractures the player base too much especially in some regions

[2022-12-23 00:59:31] <Richie364> also, people may worry it will affect game balance decisions
[2022-12-23 00:59:32] <+Nerds_The_Word> everyones so up in arms about the idea of a solo mode. but yall gotta realize, us hardcore players are the minority. longevity depends on hooking casuals too. just my 2 cents
[2022-12-23 00:59:36] <%+LusciousTigerAss> devs have said this game was designed with groups in mind. solos are just like elden ring invasions
[2022-12-23 00:59:37] <AdamJamez> this isnt a low pop game

[2022-12-23 00:59:59] <SpiffyinaJiff> as a solo I want th3 option to face a team.  don't take that option away
[2022-12-23 01:00:13] <%$ViktorHarks> @SpiffyinaJiff agreed 100%
[2022-12-23 01:00:14] <Catsinabag420> ^
[2022-12-23 01:00:16] <soul_si1ver> @AdamJamez  alot of games like this dont have solo mode like tarkov and the cycle. its not that big a deal, and yeah i play solo i hvave no friends
[2022-12-23 01:00:18] <%+ZayneD420> the one guy is right about splitting the player base up, could kill the game before its even out
[2022-12-23 01:00:20] <%+LusciousTigerAss> Futterwhacken thats a bit hard to do while the lobby is loading. im thinking Darktide style squad filling, i wouldnt play that game if i had to Find a group every time.
[2022-12-23 01:00:24] <Richie364> i like facing teams too, but the fact they can rez is frustrating
[2022-12-23 01:00:26] <+Nerds_The_Word> no ones talking about taking anything away. theyre saying add an additional solo mode
[2022-12-23 01:00:27] <%JackBlaque> there will be plenty of teams in solo queue, don't u worry
[2022-12-23 01:00:35] <AdamJamez> "We will need to test it first. We may make these tests public in future playtests to help us collect data. We will make our decision after these tests."
[2022-12-23 01:00:37] <%taz_bruh> so you make the solo que able to opt out of. IE a solo can choose to go in solo and not with the group.
[2022-12-23 01:00:42] <%+LusciousTigerAss> JackBlaque aint that the truth of it
[2022-12-23 01:00:42] <AdamJamez> there gonna try solos regardless
[2022-12-23 01:00:45] <+PhtevenMGC> bleeding skeletons is cool
[2022-12-23 01:00:46] <SpottyJJ> yeah iwish there was a solo queue
[2022-12-23 01:01:00] <%JackBlaque> @LusciousTigerAss its why solo queues never work
[2022-12-23 01:01:09] <%+Vance_Nibbly> players
[2022-12-23 01:01:12] <%+ZayneD420> i could see that, give solos a 1.5x adventure point boost
[2022-12-23 01:01:15] <%Haumex> Like Hunt Showdown have the option to allow teams of 3 in queue. Facing duo’s doesn’t seem that unbalanced
[2022-12-23 01:01:17] <@%^Nightbot> Follow on twitter: @sequisha
[2022-12-23 01:01:31] <AdamJamez> every game besides apex has multiple queues because not adding them makes alot of players not play
[2022-12-23 01:01:34] <+AgentFunGaming> oh they coming
[2022-12-23 01:01:43] <ez_street> goku at the end of the hall
[2022-12-23 01:01:45] <mimoozoo> the people that really want solo queues might just change their mind once they feel the rush of taking out a 3 man on your own...
[2022-12-23 01:01:46] VIEWERS: 4 854
[2022-12-23 01:01:46] <%+LusciousTigerAss> JackBlaque especially with voip people will want to set that up easy. OR...there could be a dungeon mechanic of if youre too close to someone you guys take damage. idk
[2022-12-23 01:01:46] <AdamJamez> it would split the playerbase having them but it would cause alot of people not to play not having them
[2022-12-23 01:01:47] <SpottyJJ> @ZayneD420 thats a p good idea
[2022-12-23 01:01:50] <nogsTV> bro almost 21 hours you are a machine

[2022-12-23 01:02:22] <%+ZayneD420> theres a few games that dont do solo and u face squads a ton, its doable just not for the casual player i guess

[2022-12-23 01:02:29] <AdamJamez> there gonna test solo queues prob in the next playtest and i think there gonna be poppin
[2022-12-23 01:02:31] <+Nerds_The_Word> @AdamJamez everyone always worries about that, but it never happens. again, casuals are what make games money, not the super hardcore

[2022-12-23 18:31:38] <%BoltSauce> @ForeverAloneHero oh its about that temperature yeah. Heated tires only really do much if you treat the roads like a racetrack though right? Ive ridden in freezing weather too before.

[2022-12-23 18:32:48] <OmniPandacious> @AyeMagPi Exactly. The perk doesn't provide any buffs. It just lets you pick up weapons and use them. Why such a heavy damage reduction? Why reduce damage at all?!?!

[2022-12-23 19:10:48] <OmniPandacious> The horseman's axe seems like simple math. If it attacks 2 times a second and the big axe attacks once a second, then the +10 bonus damage is gonna be way bigger on the horseman's axe.

[2022-12-23 20:47:07] <JamesonBlunts> yall know the rules, kill 1 theres 21, kill 2 theres 3, kill 3 theres another team
[2022-12-23 20:47:13] <JamesonBlunts> 2*
[2022-12-23 20:47:13] <%ganjaClause> Bet they cant win 1v3s like seq tho ceezMT
[2022-12-23 20:47:15] <BELZIE_> they gotta add separate ques lol
[2022-12-23 20:47:16] <handlights> solo queue only lobbies would be so hectic. I would love it
[2022-12-23 20:47:48] <%iamCodec> Well they aren't planning on adding solo lobbies lol Git gud MiniK
[2022-12-23 20:47:48] <%+JayDoobs> solo and duo being together wouldn't be too bad of an idea

[2022-12-23 20:48:36] <AmusingSparrow> at least add a 2-man queue

[2022-12-23 20:48:42] <$steveleking> so just throw em in with 3mans lol
[2022-12-23 20:48:42] <BELZIE_> but thats a guaranteed problem right now with trio in solo
[2022-12-23 20:48:44] <ugongetthiswork> 2 better than 3

[2022-12-23 20:49:40] <BELZIE_> solo que would add a whole different dimension bc you could play each class expecting 1v1 not needing to prep. for 3v1
[2022-12-23 20:49:50] <+Theelootgoblin> watching this is AMAZING lol
[2022-12-23 20:50:12] <+daybreak137> could always just run instead of 1v3

[2022-12-23 21:59:49] <%Seretanplays> Voip can really make or break atmosphere in a game.. rly hard to say whether or not it will be a benefit for dnd

[2022-12-23 22:33:15] <SamileX> @Big_Tata you can just mute it then
[2022-12-23 22:33:20] <mufferino> i like how it is without prox chat tbh
[2022-12-23 22:33:27] <nightshift_2> Yeah hearing edgelords shittalk in a low fantasy game will ruin immersion IMO
[2022-12-23 22:33:37] <godmittten66motel66> yeah should be orange colored
[2022-12-23 22:33:43] <%Beakly_> as long as theres an ooption to mute or turn it off then it's whatever
[2022-12-23 22:33:47] <+rbigbirdm> you can turn it off if you dont like it tho
[2022-12-23 22:33:47] <galentmaul> prox chat in this would turn to toxic
[2022-12-23 22:33:49] <Go420rd> we got the loot pile like 3 times in a row and then never again after that
[2022-12-23 22:33:52] <TARO_LV> I'm sure you would be given the option to disable prox chat if you want
[2022-12-23 22:33:53] <MetaShaker> I vote for Prox VOIP
[2022-12-23 22:33:55] <+Othede> It will end up turning toxic. They generally do.
[2022-12-23 22:34:00] <%MotleyGuts> @Quansto I suppose it could be one more tool for deception etc
[2022-12-23 22:34:02] <+bestname_noother> is this not high fantasy?

[2022-12-23 22:34:28] <%+LusciousTigerAss> if this game comes out with a 30+ price tag, and theres good moderation, voip could be a good thing
[2022-12-23 22:34:30] <+00six> I think I would personally turn it off, you can say a lot w/o VOIP in this game
[2022-12-23 22:34:36] <+BattlingBean> I'd prefer no voip :/

[2022-12-23 22:52:25] <%Kazz_D> I guess you can still enter a dungeon in a party and have someone to drop it for you later

[2022-12-23 22:52:48] <%+Quansto> @Sequisha have you seen the Ironmace About Us page? Pretty refreshing.
[2022-12-23 22:52:49] <ShinyLox> Just feels like insta kill for me as a low level :(
[2022-12-23 22:52:50] <%gratefulred_> @chat I have a stupid Wartales question... how do I cross a border after giving a guard the border pass?
[2022-12-23 22:52:50] <+bigpredictable> Its so fast and i love it
[2022-12-23 22:52:57] <+DragonMonkeys> thats the best thing, not having to buy a new loadout every time, and the matches start so quickly
[2022-12-23 22:52:58] <nightshift_2> marauders is decent too
[2022-12-23 22:52:59] <Zabanov> how long is an average waiting time for tarkov?
[2022-12-23 22:52:59] <Zerez> this game is wayyy more fun than i thought it would be honestly, im excited for what they do with it
[2022-12-23 22:53:06] <%+BigDan1992> The wait time in high roller could be a bit shorter tbh
[2022-12-23 22:53:06] <+HermitStew> this is my favorite game since Diablo 2 LoD
[2022-12-23 22:53:06] <bolonjo> is there cheaters in this game yet?
[2022-12-23 22:53:07] <+Clanky_Balls> has anyone run into cheaters in this game?
[2022-12-23 22:53:15] <$Ozonefreerun> cycle season 2, cheaters are basically gone, it's infinitely better
[2022-12-23 22:53:18] <%+Smoke_Cohhilition> 2 candy cane items Pog this run
[2022-12-23 22:53:21] <+rbigbirdm> i really hope cheating doesn't become a problem
[2022-12-23 22:53:22] <druqksz> They probably don't have a budget for hacking yet or some shit.
[2022-12-23 22:53:22] <%+CorlagTheBard> Seems super fun even after playing for a lot of hours. That's hard to do too with a loot based game.
[2022-12-23 22:53:22] <%$piedmontvirus> I would love to see a lil more weapons like a bastard sword for the barbarian
[2022-12-23 22:53:25] <CrazyMax7> call me a pessimist but, this game will release and a few months later the annoying meta will settled and it will die, like multiple other niche games before it.
[2022-12-23 22:53:26] <%altermealt> ttk in cycle is for ever
[2022-12-23 22:53:28] <FerA_og> @Sequisha What game? cant understand what u mean im not native eng speaker? :P
[2022-12-23 22:53:30] <+Hazilla> fighting the AI is boring though isn't it
[2022-12-23 22:53:33] <ExaUnique> knock on wood, this game still isnt launched
[2022-12-23 22:53:44] <Borlag> i saw a clip earlier of a guy with basically unlimited triple shot with default ranger loadout
[2022-12-23 22:53:48] <goodguyhadess> I feel like the number 1 guys has to be cheating. He’s like double xp from number 2
[2022-12-23 22:53:48] <theory_crafter> i spawned in the colioseum doing a high roller, and me and my group instantly went down to 50% health and we all had 1 arrow in our head, was strange. but we still extracted
[2022-12-23 22:53:50] <%Beakly_> but by then, the damage was done.
[2022-12-23 22:53:51] <+RubDubDucky> I've seen some crazy cheater videos the last two days.
[2022-12-23 22:54:06] <fwamewadth> @Sequisha Sodapoppin and Veibae while playing together encountered a cheater, ranger who was noclipping and I think aimbotting, he walked out into the open for them and they killed him pretty quickly
[2022-12-23 22:54:13] <+rbigbirdm> @CrazyMax7 you def being pessimistic

[2022-12-23 23:08:17] <Mr_Chainsaw> @Magneticall yeah i agree i think its just copying the other games that have multiple traders like tarkov but rn theres no use for them they dont even sell items for more or less than each other

[2022-12-23 23:09:41] <Magneticall> @Magneticall Exactly, it seems that its just copying Tarkov without the need to

[2022-12-23 23:11:48] <%Haumex> It shares similar concepts that have become popular in modern games.
[2022-12-23 23:11:49] <EnmityFervor> You get a stash, make your own loadout, and extract. Basically it
[2022-12-23 23:11:49] <AmaTerasu360> Skeleton Archer don't Head eyes you LUL
[2022-12-23 23:11:49] <MNZ_gg> you can shoot fireballs in Tarkov

[2022-12-23 23:12:00] <GeoSourge> HACKERMANS when you push esc it goes to a menu, like tarkov

[2022-12-23 23:12:35] <%Biozfear14> @Sequisha what do you think of the combat (swings)? could it be faster? or is fine as it is?
[2022-12-23 23:12:36] <+Nezzytime> I like how the portals aren't shared extractions, makes things interesting SeemsGood

[2022-12-23 23:12:43] <$deckard_cain> people already call it extraction royale
[2022-12-23 23:12:43] <Caffem> We had BR games at first. Now we have extractions.
[2022-12-23 23:12:48] <%OldFashioned_Bourbon> seqChat I like to call tarkov and survival CoD
[2022-12-23 23:12:49] <indocl0ud> this poor barb is in a pickle
[2022-12-23 23:12:51] <+MakSmooth> its a relatively new game genre, extraction type games

[2022-12-23 23:12:54] <nightshift_2> Its the new thing, people gotta stop just saying "tarkov game" for every extraction game, gets so old

[2022-12-23 23:13:02] <%rustyg89> true its own genre so it's gonna blow

[2022-12-23 23:13:04] <Mrmagier> how do you fight as a a barb against another barb?
[2022-12-23 23:13:06] <+ReveralX> I been extracting since i were born
[2022-12-23 23:13:11] <faulty_ferret> Like battle royale
[2022-12-23 23:13:15] <Bobsyth> So it’s Chivalry Tarkov? Kappa
[2022-12-23 23:13:15] <+dogedia> I vote we call the genre "loot em up"
[2022-12-23 23:13:24] <gestaltoids> looter shooters are a genre im excited to see spun creatively like this
[2022-12-23 23:13:26] <+havockwrecker> What game genre is tarkov?
[2022-12-23 23:13:26] <rAinbOwTReEz420sixTyniNe> tarkov wasnt even the first game with extracting
[2022-12-23 23:13:26] <cptsavaho101> @Mrmagier hack and dodge
[2022-12-23 23:13:27] <%rustyg89> I was born in the extraction
[2022-12-23 23:13:28] <%Khaladen> i repeat my point from the other day.
[2022-12-23 23:13:29] <+Staticalpumpkin> if this is like tarkov then it might as well be warzone
[2022-12-23 23:13:31] <+mkjagger> nah its felling
[2022-12-23 23:13:32] <%+CorlagTheBard> I'm excited to see an mmo that uses extraction mechanics for dungeons/raids. Think it could be a cool spin on the genre.
[2022-12-23 23:13:34] <+DragonMonkeys> we just need a namesake for this genre of game, sorta like BR or whatever
[2022-12-23 23:13:35] <IMuRkSI> early pubg was Kreygasm

[2022-12-23 23:13:57] <+monotone_moose> it feels like a natural extension of BR's to me, that doesn't mean you have to like it or even play it, but it pushes the BR category in a different direction
[2022-12-23 23:13:59] <gestaltoids> loot shoot n scoot lmao im gonna steal it
[2022-12-23 23:13:59] <Warblazer> Wasn't Tarkov going to a persistent map or did they give up on that,?

[2022-12-23 23:54:08] <%RagingArticulate> one in the center is logical

[2022-12-23 23:54:09] <+LiquidWall_> I agree, the thing though is so many spawn too early so they're out of zone whenever it gets down to 2nd to last zone

[2022-12-23 23:54:10] <%hjalbjorn> seqKEK no, make less portals if anything

[2022-12-23 23:54:23] <Aspect_____> that ruins the experience randomness is fun
[2022-12-23 23:54:24] <supa_sVinoreZ> that's how it should be, less portals higher tension at the end

[2022-12-23 23:54:26] <+notthedroidyouarelokinfor> I would say its a bug that there was no portal
