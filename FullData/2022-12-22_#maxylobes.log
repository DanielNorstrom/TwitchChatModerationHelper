[2022-12-22 07:40:53] <%+YamaJuugo> Dist says its roughly 10% chance for the good warp. I got it a bit more consistently somehow

[2022-12-22 07:41:03] <%+YamaJuugo> however, my PB was with the worst warp lmao.

[2022-12-22 07:44:52] <%+YamaJuugo> the hardest part imo, is getting used to stopping the train where you want it
[2022-12-22 07:45:01] <mkultrapunk> dont forget to quit
[2022-12-22 07:45:08] <%+YamaJuugo> you quit after you exit back outside the gate
[2022-12-22 07:45:08] <+LazyInvaderShiya> could probably use the que of the distance of the x to know when to hop off the train
[2022-12-22 07:45:30] <%+YamaJuugo> yea, you need to quit a tiny bit earlier
[2022-12-22 07:45:34] <%+YamaJuugo> since train was further back

[2022-12-22 07:53:19] <%+YamaJuugo> oh no, its not more damage I think. Hes just less aggressive and his teleports seem more normal
[2022-12-22 07:53:45] <iWhiffRL> also aiming will he smoother on higher fps which could also make it easier
[2022-12-22 07:53:51] <+foxydits> Physics certainly is affected by FPS, at least

[2022-12-22 08:21:15] <+PrimeDarkseid> dist have a theory for the quest in the right side of the map. it's where he think the most time saves could happen
[2022-12-22 08:21:49] <%+YamaJuugo> @PrimeDarkseid PauseChamp
[2022-12-22 08:22:20] <AlmostElise> I believe thats the ligma questline
[2022-12-22 08:22:27] VIEWERS: 842
[2022-12-22 08:22:29] <+PrimeDarkseid> the lonely quest i think it is right ?
[2022-12-22 08:23:28] <+PrimeDarkseid> i think it's a bit above
[2022-12-22 08:23:54] <+PrimeDarkseid> never the lighthouse i think
[2022-12-22 08:24:05] <+PrimeDarkseid> near
[2022-12-22 08:24:21] <%nGsJason> GL
[2022-12-22 08:24:27] VIEWERS: 842
[2022-12-22 08:24:29] <%+YamaJuugo> its gives 40 scrap is why I think
[2022-12-22 08:24:33] <+izbahn> 100% run?
[2022-12-22 08:24:39] <+izbahn> thatsa all I got
[2022-12-22 08:24:56] <%+YamaJuugo> well if you're by the tower and the bunker its not so far
[2022-12-22 08:24:56] <AzraeSky> need to die somehow maybe to make that worth idk?
[2022-12-22 08:25:03] <+PrimeDarkseid> yeah it's why i theorize it. because the ghost thing is near it
[2022-12-22 08:25:08] <+PrimeDarkseid> he
[2022-12-22 08:25:09] <%+YamaJuugo> especially if it speeds up the charles fight or something by upgrades
[2022-12-22 08:25:10] <D_Art_Drawing> Much more damage. Or what is it good for? I mean that much scrap
[2022-12-22 08:25:46] <%+YamaJuugo> @D_Art_Drawing more damage or speed, potentially saves you time picking up some other scrap too
[2022-12-22 08:26:09] <D_Art_Drawing> Is the damage upgreaded by amount or by % ?
[2022-12-22 08:26:19] <+PrimeDarkseid> yeah but the ghost thing is RNG he can spawn you closer to the lighthouse
[2022-12-22 08:26:21] <%+YamaJuugo> these are just my own theories anyways lol. I'll let mastermind Dist figure it out if he thinks he has something
[2022-12-22 08:26:27] VIEWERS: 842
[2022-12-22 08:27:06] <+Everdus> he says that be watch it be the next route tomorrow
[2022-12-22 08:27:27] <D_Art_Drawing> @PrimeDarkseid It would be interesting and ofcourse RNG depended run.
[2022-12-22 08:27:29] <+PrimeDarkseid> yeah it's far i agree but it's what dist is trying to see if it's possible to implement it in some way. I don't know if he will succeed tho, it's a bit far.
[2022-12-22 08:27:30] <+Krystaphonix> what did he say the island name was?
[2022-12-22 08:27:39] <AzraeSky> did they ever say why you came to this island anyway?

[2022-12-22 09:53:15] <%+YamaJuugo> @Beastmister more like the WR from yesterday LuL
[2022-12-22 09:53:29] <Beastmister> I feel like this game is getting as much of a cult followeing as goose game.
[2022-12-22 09:53:48] <%+YamaJuugo> WR was 19:09 just yesterday
[2022-12-22 09:53:58] <%+LeonardoWyrnist> no more choos for eugene Sadge
[2022-12-22 09:54:22] <pandassasin9> family friendly
[2022-12-22 09:54:27] <+NinoDonDino> goose game is way more mainstream
[2022-12-22 09:54:35] <+NinoDonDino> because it's just a good vibes game
[2022-12-22 09:54:45] <%+ChefMannie> has anyone made a Thomas the tank engine mod yet?

[2022-12-22 09:54:50] <hobrev> funnily enough, choo choo charles seems to be a speedrunner thing more then a general thing, at least on twitch
[2022-12-22 09:55:00] <+Krystaphonix> goose game digests easy
[2022-12-22 09:55:19] <+NinoDonDino> charles is pretty much a horror parodie, so people that don't like horror won't really get into it and people that don't like spiders won't like it
[2022-12-22 09:56:00] <Grognosh2> Let's run for 1300 :)
[2022-12-22 09:56:02] <+diggitydingdong> why does the train slow down so much there? isn't that bad LUL
[2022-12-22 09:56:33] <Grognosh2> This glitch will make 100% more fun too?
[2022-12-22 09:56:38] <+diggitydingdong> ah i guess the train has plenty of time to make it to where it needs to go
[2022-12-22 09:56:40] <+NinoDonDino> so that we can kill eugene quicker
[2022-12-22 09:56:48] VIEWERS: 935
[2022-12-22 09:57:05] <%+YamaJuugo> you also have to wait for the slow-mo to end as well according to Dist
[2022-12-22 09:57:11] <%+YamaJuugo> which is a mild time waste
[2022-12-22 09:57:28] <+NinoDonDino> we love you eugenem, but sacrifies have to be made, for the greater good

[2022-12-22 10:01:17] <deathdocs> does the train take more damage than normal by stopping. by the way enjoying your streams

[2022-12-22 10:03:00] <+NicoFnLeon7> what I like is that it is a short rub
[2022-12-22 10:03:03] <+NicoFnLeon7> run
[2022-12-22 10:03:19] <%+YamaJuugo> it still seems kinda RNG, but maybe a tiny bit more consistent
[2022-12-22 10:03:33] <%+YamaJuugo> ALSO, by stopping the train it ensures you leave at the right spot everytime
[2022-12-22 10:03:45] <%MetalWaldo> Right it's nice you can get like 3 runs in an hour

[2022-12-22 10:05:44] <%+YamaJuugo> usually the one jump you did is enough
[2022-12-22 10:05:51] <%+YamaJuugo> you just jump towards the far rocks
[2022-12-22 10:06:25] <%+YamaJuugo> you have to jump towards the further rocks off to the side, its a further fall
[2022-12-22 10:06:53] VIEWERS: 946
[2022-12-22 10:07:08] <%+YamaJuugo> no at the tower i mean, you jump off the tower towards the rocks to the way the guy is facing I think
[2022-12-22 10:07:16] <%+YamaJuugo> and its a longer fall down and deals enough to kill
[2022-12-22 10:07:56] <mkultrapunk> in front of the stairs

[2022-12-22 10:12:11] <+diggitydingdong> if you spam click fast enough you can place two bombs on a single column, meaning if you get it in the first four you can skip the back left

[2022-12-22 10:36:13] <!%Bird650> I'm also curious about dabbling with lower speed and 6 damage but that would be just for funsies
[2022-12-22 10:36:40] <%+YamaJuugo> i think the only issue with less speed is the train wont be in the right spots
[2022-12-22 10:36:56] <RattleMBones> Limited by budget, and what's good?
[2022-12-22 10:37:03] VIEWERS: 925
[2022-12-22 10:37:04] <!%Bird650> could you substitute that with just quitting the game later though?

[2022-12-22 10:37:58] <!%Bird650> like
[2022-12-22 10:37:58] <%+YamaJuugo> it definitely could be worth testing
[2022-12-22 10:38:00] <+woodmaster437> slender does not like you
[2022-12-22 10:38:10] <!%Bird650> you dont have to sit on the train for long
[2022-12-22 10:38:20] <%+YamaJuugo> that too, the speed helps the fight too
[2022-12-22 10:38:22] <!%Bird650> but yeah that would make sense
[2022-12-22 10:38:50] <!%Bird650> I'd be curious with 4 speed 6 damage and like 2 armor
[2022-12-22 10:39:03] VIEWERS: 925
[2022-12-22 10:39:27] <!%Bird650> thats fair
[2022-12-22 10:39:28] <%+YamaJuugo> does anyone know the actual damage reduction for armor?
[2022-12-22 10:39:32] <Akaiphoenix> yessir KKona
[2022-12-22 10:39:37] <%+YamaJuugo> because yea, one point seems like nothing
[2022-12-22 10:40:05] <!%Bird650> I just feel like if you can get through the charles fight with 4 speed you could potentially save time with less rockets and just quit the game later in your lines
[2022-12-22 10:40:33] <Grognosh2> this is the urn PotFriend
[2022-12-22 10:40:43] <%+YamaJuugo> i agree, definitely worth considering
[2022-12-22 10:40:45] <!%Bird650> if you stayed in the train longer during the main portion i could see 6 speed

[2022-12-22 10:41:38] <+woodmaster437> what's the reasoning for the odd map teleport, train clipping or something
[2022-12-22 10:42:18] <%+YamaJuugo> @woodmaster437 it allows the train to move while you're not on it
[2022-12-22 10:42:23] <Lolypopss> I always wonder how speedrunners could be so patient. If something goes wrong over and over in the game, I get angry and drop it, but speedrunners seems to like grinding the best time for years, like in RE runs. Insane serenity, wish I could have that

[2022-12-22 11:34:34] <ivantheshaman> Wasn't Calisto Protocol Unreal Engine 5?
[2022-12-22 11:34:54] <Grognosh2> Can you put the screen under the computer so the pixels doesn't have to go up against the gravity?
[2022-12-22 11:35:04] <hollowfields> callisto was ue4

[2022-12-22 11:36:30] <ivantheshaman> I enjoyed calisto, everyone hating on it i thought it was pretty good

[2022-12-22 11:42:02] <Beastmister> was scorn the body horror game?
[2022-12-22 11:42:05] <krilleknatch> if they removed the combat from Scorn id call it a nice fun experience
[2022-12-22 11:42:06] <D_Art_Drawing> Scorn, because?
[2022-12-22 11:42:29] <Beastmister> I didn't hear much about Scorn.

[2022-12-22 12:11:04] <krilleknatch> i never understood how an autosplitter works, does it check for pixels and split?
[2022-12-22 12:11:11] <%+diggitydingdong> it was actually good i got a reset there COPIUM thats what we wanted

[2022-12-22 12:11:44] <krilleknatch> @KassXCII ah that makes alot of sense
[2022-12-22 12:11:49] <%+diggitydingdong> @krilleknatch A game lives in the computer's memory, RAM. autosplitters read that memory for certain values that indicate different events in game
[2022-12-22 12:11:51] <krilleknatch> thanks
[2022-12-22 12:11:57] <%+diggitydingdong> its a massive pita
[2022-12-22 12:12:12] <Lidawano> that's really cool actually
[2022-12-22 12:12:29] <Lidawano> always wondered how they worked myself
[2022-12-22 12:12:30] <%+diggitydingdong> there are some autosplitters that do what you described though, altho its a bit more complex
[2022-12-22 12:12:37] <%+diggitydingdong> for example cant read the memory of a console
[2022-12-22 12:12:48] <carerletmeon> Is this the route dist worked on or did we figure out a better one since this morning?

[2022-12-22 13:55:01] <harleywilson2012> Im back
[2022-12-22 13:55:08] <jack_burtonpce> I will say that I can at least say I had fun playing FEAR 3 even if I was disappointed with it, I genuinely cant say I even had fun with Dead Space 3
[2022-12-22 13:55:41] <harleywilson2012> Im back
[2022-12-22 13:55:58] <hobrev> Red Faction 2 rolls back on the destructible environments, and its kinda forced to because the game is much more your basic confined space fps

[2022-12-22 13:56:26] <oofouchbonehurtingjuice> Speaking of older games that reminds me of a favorite of mine of the days of old. The Incredible Hulk: Ultimate Destruction
[2022-12-22 13:56:34] <TheAwesomePigeon> and the open world right?
[2022-12-22 13:56:39] <%TheTrueSmaugh> ive never had sesame seed sauce. what's it like?
[2022-12-22 13:56:43] <TheAwesomePigeon> sure rad faction 2 was linear
[2022-12-22 13:56:51] <%ThatAllFrosty> man, kinda feels bad that the GPU I bought during black friday is kinda borked, I can't RMA it either since it was a 'special deal' so I have to return it
[2022-12-22 13:56:53] <hobrev> and to be fair, I did play RF2 PC back when it was new, nowadays you probably can find mods that make it work even half right
[2022-12-22 13:57:03] <%nGsJason> DS3 and Fear 3 I have the same opinion of. Both games were disappointing compared to the previous games AND the player 2 experience was more interesting in both
[2022-12-22 13:57:11] <%ThatAllFrosty> gonna get my money back but cant buy anything equivalent for the same price
[2022-12-22 13:57:28] <jack_burtonpce> @nGsJason I will go to bat for Armageddon anyday, very underappreciated

[2022-12-22 14:15:03] <%nGsJason> but X/Y and 3rd gen remakes were nice

[2022-12-22 14:16:36] <%ThatAllFrosty> Yes, but those are more so based off of the originals than Crystal
[2022-12-22 14:16:40] <+sLimbutin> @BystanderTim_ Yea there isnt a remake unless you count the Liquid Crystal romhack which is 1:1 pretty much with added storyline
[2022-12-22 14:16:40] <%+Hirogashu_Gaming> my faves are crystal and emerald for the music and Electrike is my spirit animal maxyyPom

[2022-12-22 14:16:58] <%ThatAllFrosty> they do incorporate a good portion of Crystal though
[2022-12-22 14:17:01] <BystanderTim_> @nGsJason I mean, sure, but even minor stuff, calling HeartGold and SoulSilver a remake of crystal even though they ignore the things that crystal chooses to do is one thing

[2022-12-22 14:19:04] <oofouchbonehurtingjuice> Did have Gold/Silver though
[2022-12-22 14:19:24] <%nGsJason> first gen had blue, 2nd had crystal, 3rd had emerald, 4th platinum
[2022-12-22 14:19:25] <%ThatAllFrosty> Diamond/Pearl
[2022-12-22 14:19:26] <oofouchbonehurtingjuice> Diamond/Pearl/Platinum
[2022-12-22 14:19:28] <%+TheSanctusNex> Diamond, Pearl, and Platinum
[2022-12-22 14:19:29] <%nGsJason> that was the last of the trios
[2022-12-22 14:19:30] <SoulsideJourney_> i still have all my old cartridges. Sometimes I think about bringing my old ingame teams up to the newer games and bottle capping them so I can battle with them online.
[2022-12-22 14:19:33] <Staenhus> I literally played Crystal so much that the cartridge broke, stopped being able to save the game.
[2022-12-22 14:19:33] <%Silverwolf32> Diamond Pearl Platinum yeah
[2022-12-22 14:19:34] <First_Try_i_swear> i mean can't you bind U as a secondary keybind to all these interactions? Or will it always limit you to binding the same button to only 2 hahah
[2022-12-22 14:19:43] <BystanderTim_> @nGsJason yellow, not blue
[2022-12-22 14:19:50] <%+TheSanctusNex> Platinum was a wild ride.
[2022-12-22 14:20:03] <%nGsJason> Blue was the 3rd release in gen 1 aside from green and red
[2022-12-22 14:20:07] <%ThatAllFrosty> Platinum ending is definitely my favourite of the three
[2022-12-22 14:20:08] <oofouchbonehurtingjuice> @SoulsideJourney_ I'd get anything you want off ASAP so you can beat the internal batterys dying
[2022-12-22 14:20:11] <%nGsJason> yellow was one released later bc of anime

[2022-12-22 14:21:22] <$rockstar420> i wish they would remake yellow. that was one of my favorite gameboy games as a kid.
[2022-12-22 14:21:29] <%+TheSanctusNex> Gen 1 is wild. JP Red-Green is revision 1. EN Red-Blue is rev 2. and Yellow being rev 3.

[2022-12-22 14:44:29] <Cirnostyle> FF has a run button? cirOwO
[2022-12-22 14:45:12] <Multiroester> CCC is ok for 1 dude to code it. Ofc it lacks of many things. But its a very refreshing game concept and not another Walking Sim
[2022-12-22 14:45:18] <TheMeatwad12> Mixed? its at 92% on steam
[2022-12-22 14:45:26] <BystanderTim_> Talking about fatal frame, I'm still incredibly surprised that we're getting a localized port of Fatal Frame 4 next year
[2022-12-22 14:45:38] <Cirnostyle> I kinda wish they remastered FF 1+2 and brought them to PC too
[2022-12-22 14:45:39] <%nGsJason> speaking of FF, FF4 early next year
[2022-12-22 14:45:45] <%nGsJason> like everything else
[2022-12-22 14:45:59] <+Grethar> somebody in chat said so
[2022-12-22 14:46:03] <Eldritch_Potato> On steam it did well but i saw on IGN it was low and Metacritic , they said the game was too short and bare-bones
[2022-12-22 14:46:08] <%nGsJason> FF3 is more likely to get ported than 1/2 next lol
[2022-12-22 14:46:09] <%nGsJason> imho
[2022-12-22 14:46:21] <BystanderTim_> Maiden of Black Water did *okay* for the rerelease, but the fact that we got 4 anyways, make me think that they're just wanting to revive the series
[2022-12-22 14:46:21] <%nGsJason> unless HD trilogy or something
[2022-12-22 14:46:24] <+Grethar> Shouldn't believe people online :D

[2022-12-22 15:30:11] <Malisom> pretty much no unskippable cutscenes and no loading screens = big speedrun potential.
