[2022-12-17 14:07:15] <TinMouser> It's probably to do with the really old cars and checking the lug and if it wobbled... my complete guess

[2022-12-17 14:07:58] <%vollpin> theres one explanation @Sequisha  "There was a good reason to kick duel truck tires. If one had no air, the other tire would hold it up not revealing it to be flat. Kicking a tire with no air would move the tire."

[2022-12-17 14:09:34] <suicideking187> back into the day people would kick the tire to see if the bearings were solid. bearings were made with 25 ball bearings and would sometimes wobble.

[2022-12-17 14:38:20] <%hardcorhobbs> @zunahme get the remote. It keeps your controller from depleting.
[2022-12-17 14:38:40] <Baconfang> reading about it  and watching vids and streams. it is a game i would pick up and i always like to play with two handed weapons. hence why i have been reading up about it.
[2022-12-17 14:38:50] <suicideking187> gotta learn the way
[2022-12-17 14:38:59] <%+Zunahme> @hardcorhobbs does it work well?
[2022-12-17 14:39:15] <+ballaballaJEEZ> @Sequisha yeah - bsically just need to learn the timing and in the end i think evry weapon has ups n down ^^
[2022-12-17 14:39:15] <%+Zunahme> this is my first console in a loooong time
[2022-12-17 14:39:27] <Baconfang> aye you can be a pro gamer so its always good to watch your stream and see how you deal with it.
[2022-12-17 14:39:29] <TinMouser> you would think someone who could swing that monster axe could toss a torch just a little further
[2022-12-17 14:39:49] <%hardcorhobbs> @zunahme we use the 4 and the 5 as media centers. Both official remotes were fantastic.
[2022-12-17 14:39:51] <%Biozfear14> the swing animation looks so smooth compared to Mortal Online. i might try this game!
[2022-12-17 14:40:24] <%+Zunahme> @hardcorhobbs okidoki! I'll look into that then! ty!

[2022-12-17 14:40:45] <%hardcorhobbs> @zunahme the 5 even syncs with the tv. So we can volume control.
[2022-12-17 14:41:03] <suicideking187> so is there a way to increase swing speed ?

[2022-12-17 14:42:37] <Its_Big_Boi> different types of 2h have diff swing speed. usually faster swing speed does less damage @suicideking187

[2022-12-17 23:34:27] <%+Dbrn47> Dwarf Fortress
[2022-12-17 23:34:32] <%+kma_ape> @yaboyjoekozz good to know
[2022-12-17 23:34:35] <Fuzzels__> @Shnabub rogue is pretty decent for solo. You can evade groups easily enough
[2022-12-17 23:34:38] <trizket> how do you get the candy canes ? @Sequisha
[2022-12-17 23:34:43] <0DiNsc> @The_Magic_Dave try sprint its not a solo use, the heal is rough but once you can bring a campfire should be okay. i think fighter feels great
[2022-12-17 23:34:44] <GoddRook> when did maintenance start?
[2022-12-17 23:34:55] <ivory_knife> servers are down for an hour
