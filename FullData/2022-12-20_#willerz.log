[2022-12-20 00:12:22] <%+jasp3rs> SMG meta would be best meta.

[2022-12-20 00:22:57] <%curlyfriesncoke1> so will everybody thats 50/50 right now get 70/30 for first 100k
[2022-12-20 00:22:57] <%ItsMorris762> Twitch has to make their share eh
[2022-12-20 00:23:03] <%SaltySailorTV> kind of garbage imo. then the government taxes you more as well every dollar after 100k
[2022-12-20 00:23:05] <+ittybittybrittyx> seems like a matter of time until people stop subbing and just donate only

[2022-12-20 00:24:25] <%$thwmpp> at least twitch gives the opportunity ig could be worse

[2022-12-20 00:26:09] <%og_thundercat> yeah but shees, twitch takes 50% then the feds take 33% and there goes all your hard work
[2022-12-20 00:26:11] <papapricegaming> someone like Ludwig and ninja are going to loose ALOT tho
