[2023-01-10 02:36:21] <@%^Nightbot> Arianna is an uploaded consciousness. Years ago she died in an accident but her brain was salvaged, scanned, and uploaded into a simulated world. She now lives alone in a simulation with her only connection to the outside world being through the internet and streaming.
