[2023-01-05 00:30:47] <!%+MadDogHux> I feel like there are too many cheaters to be all "old people" who generally quit gaming as time goes.
[2023-01-05 00:30:51] <%+Nine8Twelve> NO ONE IS HACKING! its those Logitech G Herman Miller Chairs... @WillerZ

[2023-01-05 00:32:32] <%Playermodd> I think the majority of cheaters are 20-30s year old who want to 1.) be a popular streamer who is good at the game or 2.) make money with rmt

[2023-01-05 01:34:36] <$Xutsi> 23 reloads = 2.3 points before it turns red
[2023-01-05 01:34:53] <%+SirBake> getting kills with  it def helps

[2023-01-05 01:35:18] <%+Warmaster_OotP> @SirBake shots on target helps, few legs and then the head on scavs helps a ton
[2023-01-05 01:35:21] <%+drduck1027> I just reload 40 then wait 3 min
[2023-01-05 01:35:41] <$Xutsi> esbe412 No one said per raid, it's literally 23 reloads. 0.1 points per reload before it turns into red and u basically gain 0 on red
[2023-01-05 01:35:46] <%Yamama420> I thought they fixed that🤔 you can still lvl up your sniper skill by reloading a mosin? @willerz

[2023-01-05 15:32:04] <+DayjobPlays> bsg should remove the skill ups for reloading and significantly increase the xp you get from sniper kills imo
[2023-01-05 15:32:21] <%xgon9> No lie, that shit is annoying after 17 in a row
[2023-01-05 15:32:22] <+lazysnip3r> they are 2dumb to do that

[2023-01-05 16:34:41] <%+blazinmonkey> at what level scav karma do you get like 10 minute cooldowns?
[2023-01-05 16:35:02] <xcited0ne> Scavs this wipe are complete garbage, they should give away your position at most, not wallbang you.
[2023-01-05 16:35:08] VIEWERS: 1 896
[2023-01-05 16:35:19] <%+cgags14> you need to have the stuff done in the hideout as well for fast scav cooldown
[2023-01-05 16:35:22] <%rekkzan> prob at max + hideout buff
[2023-01-05 16:35:31] <%+cgags14> mainly the hideout tbh

[2023-01-05 17:12:11] <!%+MadDogHux> Bush whacking is a common willerLobstah  tactic in Tarkov, lying in wait for their unsuspecting prey.
[2023-01-05 17:12:17] <lemurkemur> or is it some chad stuff i dont understand as a timmy
[2023-01-05 17:12:32] <Brain64cores> @phinvincible something like that

[2023-01-05 17:13:15] <+Dr1919> @CKsavage_ They're just bad players
[2023-01-05 17:13:15] <%+blazinmonkey> nah whats actually sad is the amount of real cheaters there are and how many bad players blame cheaters for them being bad Sadge
[2023-01-05 17:13:17] <%+trevandezz> @CKsavage_ lol
[2023-01-05 17:13:19] <lemurkemur> insurance scam the flir?

[2023-01-05 17:13:38] <CKsavage_> ive ran almost 200 raids and ran into 1 cheater on labs lol.....its not as bad as you guys make it
[2023-01-05 17:13:39] <!%+MadDogHux> The large claw is mostly for show and  mating purposes, it is the smaller more dexterous claw that willerRAT  should keep away from.
[2023-01-05 17:13:40] <%+trevandezz> theres a cheater in your game every 4-5 raids, i promise.
[2023-01-05 17:13:41] <GnomeGuyyy> @CKsavage_ what servers u on i did every other game to flying aimbotters
[2023-01-05 17:13:53] <%FlowerWater_> @CKsavage_ what servers are you on?

[2023-01-05 17:14:02] <CKsavage_> I have all US servers manually selected
[2023-01-05 17:14:04] <Devgrusome> @CKsavage_ I'm over 100 raids so far and have encountered 2 cheaters. Both times have been shoreline
[2023-01-05 17:14:09] <%+trevandezz> just cause they dont head-eyes you doesn't mean they're not running by and avoiding you with walls
[2023-01-05 17:14:17] <%FlowerWater_> ^
[2023-01-05 17:14:17] <@^Nightbot> ^
[2023-01-05 17:14:17] <%Playermodd> My interchange night raids are 3-5 man squads all fighting in the middle of the mall lol
[2023-01-05 17:14:24] <%+PremiumGamingLive2> What's your goal rn?
[2023-01-05 17:14:25] <Brain64cores> @WillerZ The squick of your mike triggers my brain everytime :)
[2023-01-05 17:14:29] <%+blazinmonkey> so if i watch about 12 hours of tarkov streamers and play about 6 hours a day and see a total of 3 cheaters in 18 hours of game play ... i think people are just shit at the game and dont know wtf is going on
[2023-01-05 17:14:39] <%Drolyx> @maddoghux LUL LUL
[2023-01-05 17:14:40] <CKsavage_> I feel cheater accusations spread like wildfire only because bad/inexperienced players die and blame that

[2023-01-05 17:15:26] <%+trevandezz> like i said, there's a cheater in your game every 4-5 raids. just cause they're not killing you doesn't mean they're not in the lobbby

[2023-01-05 17:15:30] <!%+MadDogHux> LMAO somebody hit him!
[2023-01-05 17:15:38] <+Cutive_> @CKsavage_ nah ive just seen a ton of clips of cheaters today its mad, they float above the ground and all bullets "miss"
[2023-01-05 17:15:41] <%CLOSS__> @CKsavage_ I agree to some extent. But the game is rampant with cheaters atm
[2023-01-05 17:15:41] <Clapp1ty> 1tap Kappa
[2023-01-05 17:15:42] <%FlowerWater_> Acting like cheaters aren't around is pretty naive.  Especially being able to sell keys on Flea again
[2023-01-05 17:15:48] <+bondoblast> anyone who kills me has to be a cheater  :)

[2023-01-05 17:16:12] <+sawzall_surgeon> Do you like the Aug so far? Is it comparable to other weapons?
[2023-01-05 17:16:14] <CKsavage_> noone said cheaters arent in the game. The def are. But not as bad as you think
[2023-01-05 17:16:31] <%+blazinmonkey> its no where near as bad as chat makes it out to be
[2023-01-05 17:16:38] <defrutas> ive never been killed by a blatant cheater in tarkov in my 300hrs, maybe some fishy deaths but thats it
[2023-01-05 17:16:44] <LeviathanT96> @flowerwater_ the community doesn’t care about cheaters because the devs don’t LUL
[2023-01-05 17:16:56] <%CLOSS__> @CKsavage_ clearly not played lighthouse or reserve recently lmao
[2023-01-05 17:17:12] <+Cutive_> @CKsavage_ nah its worse then u think, i havent seen one personally but looking online its insane, just look at zyrachi masks on flea

[2023-01-05 17:18:25] <+Gabe_Valentine> the idea you need to be "chad" to see them is idiotic
[2023-01-05 17:18:25] <!%its_me_its_lee> @WillerZ might as well just turn on the cheats if your gonna use a thermal KEKW

[2023-01-05 18:21:32] <N1S_Ghost> 55 is alot but you cant get partner without an average of 75 so to get partnered you need to be in the less than 1% of twitch at one time
[2023-01-05 18:21:35] <haedenden> 1% is already huge amount
[2023-01-05 18:21:48] <XtremeGucci> my game crashes when i extract and loading in raid how do i fix chat

[2023-01-05 18:21:57] <%JDiamatti> I think part of the risk is the unstable income. You can make 2k one month and $5 the next
[2023-01-05 18:22:04] <%N_I_C_E_XD> @haedenden of what ?

[2023-01-05 18:22:48] <Xeriyo> yo just checking can i get no drops here? thanks in advance
[2023-01-05 18:22:49] <+karizog> the drops are probably ass anyway

[2023-01-05 20:13:10] <%alexibear20> Things have changed since then… Back when the scavs at power station on shoreline wore fort and kiver’s and were terrifying. Instant reload. Healing while gunning. NOT HAVING CMS KITS!
[2023-01-05 20:13:11] <%JurassicWrex> That's why I'm over here. Just like the vibes
[2023-01-05 20:13:13] <R18CH0P> And some people just flat out suck.
[2023-01-05 20:13:19] <wackyshaq> when you could just kill a scav if you liked hjs gun
[2023-01-05 20:13:20] <%captfluffysocks> You could reset your scav clock? wtf
[2023-01-05 20:13:22] <fuddledumpers> i still die around plenty of corners, but maybe the abusability is less now? idk
[2023-01-05 20:13:34] <%iSnipeLikeJesus> I would never play this game if that was the case
[2023-01-05 20:13:45] <%alexibear20> Remember being able to pick which side of the map we could spawn on @willerz
[2023-01-05 20:13:52] <DeathlokTheDemolisher> when shoreline only had the shoreline
[2023-01-05 20:13:55] <+no_urbad> did they remove cultist or are they just really fucking rare now
[2023-01-05 20:13:55] <DeathlokTheDemolisher> lol
[2023-01-05 20:14:07] <%+redhood91007> i think that would be awesome! just have one time clock going and if it happens to be night then you do that raid
[2023-01-05 20:14:13] <fuddledumpers> @no_urbad wouldnt be surprised if the spawn rate is just stupid low... bosses at 5%
[2023-01-05 20:14:21] <%Augoost_> Everyone spawned boilers
