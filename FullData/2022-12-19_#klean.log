[2022-12-19 20:33:43] <TigerAkua> @kastrullpotta if you are clearing rooms correctly you will never run into a mob that blocks you. If it's happening alot then rooms aren't being cleared properly and there's too much running around happening and not enough PvE clearing. It's bad to say it's a damn bug lol

[2022-12-19 21:25:55] <Asnen> I also played KDC: Deliverance
[2022-12-19 21:26:04] <+Hurpud> dark messiah is sick
[2022-12-19 21:26:16] <stinkhat> yeah i loved dark messiah back in the day
[2022-12-19 21:26:21] <+Hurpud> i hope they add a grease/ice attack on the floor to ragdoll people
[2022-12-19 21:26:26] <Cheshired> @Klean torches?
[2022-12-19 21:26:28] <Asnen> But I might give KDC another try, it has a lot of stuff I like
[2022-12-19 21:26:39] <onlyfoxtw> u can check inventory on spectator mode. Change view with V and then just press Tab to check
[2022-12-19 21:26:52] <+Vacc4r0> i havent been able to regain my second wind with fires. Is that not a thing anymore?
[2022-12-19 21:26:54] <CatEatingMushrooms> I gave both Dark Messiah and Kingdom Come another run very recently, as well.

[2022-12-19 21:27:27] <Asnen> I am a big fan of Gothic and Morrowind so that's kind of my style of game
[2022-12-19 21:27:32] <+Hurpud> it's insane how good of a game dark messiah is and nothing has ever been made again with mechanics as goofy and interactable as it

[2022-12-19 21:28:28] <CatEatingMushrooms> Dishonored, by the same dev team, retains a bit of Dark Messiah's DNA.
[2022-12-19 21:29:02] <Asnen> I played Dishonored as well, it's amazing but not really an RPG
