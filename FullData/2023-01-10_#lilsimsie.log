[2023-01-10 00:09:21] <%heatherlouise_> @scassiday81 You can’t kick villagers out unfortunately you have to wait till they ask to leave
[2023-01-10 00:09:26] <%+maiziemaze23> If you run out of days, you could try going back to the 26. I think there was a bubble on that day.
[2023-01-10 00:09:26] <qbert12lol> Will you stream on the 13th?
[2023-01-10 00:09:30] <TheGracefulLion> so we know frank has to go, but who else are you kicking?

[2023-01-10 00:09:40] <@%^Moobot> simsieNo NO, DO THIS! CHANGE THIS! EWWWW! Backseat gaming is NEVER allowed. Suggestions are always appreciated, but do not attempt to make demands or force Kayla to do anything. There is a difference between friendly suggestions and aggressive demands. Ultimately she is the one playing the game, not you! simsieNo

[2023-01-10 00:26:13] <delilahkatherine> would it be less creepy if they didn't blink in sync
[2023-01-10 00:26:13] <%$alxxandraa> if the blinking wasn’t at the same time then they’d be cute
[2023-01-10 00:26:15] <akhigh10> wait they blink in unison???

[2023-01-10 00:26:18] <@%+MrsTomato101814> as a mother i believe i have the right to say that the kangaroos with their babies are super creepy
[2023-01-10 00:26:19] <il0vemycats> does anyone know what simsie has?
[2023-01-10 00:26:19] <@%$ceesees> @fatherfrogust no

[2023-01-10 00:33:49] <akhigh10> florida does have bears...
[2023-01-10 00:33:49] <@%goosekingdom> madison hates maple so much because she says 'honey' and it sounds condescending
[2023-01-10 00:33:50] <%andreaaar28> Can I make a version of you in the sims?
[2023-01-10 00:33:51] <%+SG816> I could see Maple at Disney
[2023-01-10 00:33:51] <%$digitalfa3ery> i hunted for maples once
[2023-01-10 00:33:54] <%mandanaismoi> what's your favourite type of vegan milk?

[2023-01-10 00:33:55] <lucidxluna_> I wish we had more personality types
[2023-01-10 00:33:58] <%+jo_silver90> my area has alot of "hippie/ natural" types so vegan things aren't to hard to come by even though we are a smaller community no near a big city
[2023-01-10 00:34:03] BITS: thats_pretty_emo (100)
[2023-01-10 00:34:03] <thats_pretty_emo> thanks for being a calm cozy space. my mom is currently in the hospitals (shes having some complications with a surgery) so its nice to be able to sit and relax with you Cheer100
[2023-01-10 00:34:03] <@%+MrsTomato101814> maple would be a good villager for an autumn island
[2023-01-10 00:34:03] <%42hitch42> yeah maple isn't florida vibes. Canada vibes, maybe
[2023-01-10 00:34:05] <%Dawnie3296> Daiya makes really good vegan foods and I am not biased because I am Canadian.
[2023-01-10 00:34:06] <RiisYoung> Maple would 100% Disneybound
[2023-01-10 00:34:08] <$julraine> Yuck

[2023-01-10 00:34:17] <qbert12lol> Snap is relatable because she’s always sleeping on the couch
[2023-01-10 00:34:18] <smollbabyangel> mcdonalds in most europe make non vegan french fries

[2023-01-10 00:34:22] <+XMommaSageX> Is Dan Vegan?
[2023-01-10 00:34:26] <+xemily330> so if the cookies are vegan, can you eat them raw?
[2023-01-10 00:34:28] <%+kristastarr> McDonald’s aren’t vegan in the US, they are in Canada
[2023-01-10 00:34:29] <%magix532> @MrsTomato101814 as someone making an autumn fairytale island i want maple

[2023-01-10 00:34:38] <%+cupiditi> I had to break the news about McDonald’s fries to my vegan friend as a mcManager </3
[2023-01-10 00:34:38] <%+kaykayperks> my work had a fryer for only fries! the other fryer is for everything else!
[2023-01-10 00:34:38] <%samanthalovescats> bojangles fries are not vegan
[2023-01-10 00:34:40] <tibbs_dibbs> my friend made me a pinata for a birthday some years back, and she just put loose skittles in it because it was the only vegan candy she could think of - we were both vegan :'D
[2023-01-10 00:34:41] <%heatherlouise_> @smollbabyangel Uk McDonald’s cooks the fries separate in vegetable oil
[2023-01-10 00:34:41] <simparker> DQ fries are vegan!

[2023-01-10 00:34:52] <%justRayxox> Lilsimsie, are there any vegetables you don’t like?
[2023-01-10 00:34:53] <TheGracefulLion> Airfried french fries are the best and vegan too
[2023-01-10 00:34:55] <%+jadethomass> we fry everything in the same fryer at work
[2023-01-10 00:34:55] <lilizazou> @MrsTomato101814 thx
[2023-01-10 00:34:59] <%+Abi_Jee> ohhh so it's not because of a health reason you are a vegan. it's a personal choice! I respect it either way
[2023-01-10 00:34:59] [Announcement] <Moobot> We are villager hunting for Wart Jr. in Animal Crossing! simsiePanic
[2023-01-10 00:35:02] <%+kaykayperks> we also have a lot of gluten free options too!
[2023-01-10 00:35:04] <%+emimadi17> do you have honey? I know some vegans will have it
[2023-01-10 00:35:04] <%$samanthaverb> ick
[2023-01-10 00:35:04] <%+1mp3rfectb0y> i dont think most restaurants fry nuggets and fries in the same oil, me thinks doesnt seem that prtatical tbh
[2023-01-10 00:35:05] <victoria2992> I have himmm
[2023-01-10 00:35:07] <%+littledicastanaccount> i have 1 (one) villager crossed off im so sad
[2023-01-10 00:35:08] <thisiskatithink> I like meat, but the same fryer thing seems like cross contamination? Like unhygienic and what abt allergies
[2023-01-10 00:35:09] <%+Alyx1210> ace is the place with the helpful hardware folks
[2023-01-10 00:35:09] <%yema_ema> not you saying ick to Ace when i thought "oh cute" LOL
[2023-01-10 00:35:11] <lollie_pops_> what does mcdonald’s fry their fries in?
[2023-01-10 00:35:13] <thisiskatithink> Kinda upsetting
[2023-01-10 00:35:19] <%$lollyybee> fav veggies?
[2023-01-10 00:35:22] <@%goosekingdom> ace's catchphrase is ace. that is so boring
[2023-01-10 00:35:26] <%$impatientsquid> kitchen's i've worked in have had a gluten free fryer and thats it
[2023-01-10 00:35:26] <+tanabanana96> They’re not supposed to fry in the same basket that can be considered cross contamination
[2023-01-10 00:35:28] <%Jeais> Husband has had allergy problems from shared oil simsieShake
[2023-01-10 00:35:29] <%missrileybear> When I did the Disney college program I worked in quick service and whenever we had an allergy we had a separate fryer and station to prepare the food to prevent cross contamination
[2023-01-10 00:35:31] <+Smilinsteph83> its jsut so they dont have to reheat it
[2023-01-10 00:35:32] <%+tarheelfan1> As is my fav villager because he was on my OG game cube island
[2023-01-10 00:35:32] <delilahkatherine> ace is so me lmao
[2023-01-10 00:35:33] <madisonhedden> I love how you talk to your chat, it makes it feel like a good community and a good place to come when you’re feeling stressed as well
[2023-01-10 00:35:33] <%niamh_00> also you dont have to go "all or nothing"
[2023-01-10 00:35:35] <@%Little_Dica> @goosekingdom they're very confident i guess LOL
[2023-01-10 00:35:35] <%$alaurel17> its usually one big oil vat with multiple baskets
[2023-01-10 00:35:35] <smollbabyangel> mcdonalds dont often have vegetarian fries so
[2023-01-10 00:35:35] <%Cozy_Gamer8> @lollie_pops_ the same fryer as their meats
[2023-01-10 00:35:37] <%mandanaismoi> @lollie_pops_ they're supposed to fry them seperately but my brother worked at mcdonalds for a while and nobody there cared enough to do that even tho it was policy </33
[2023-01-10 00:35:39] <%+pluuuttoo> I used to work fast food and we used the same two fryers for everything
[2023-01-10 00:35:40] <%Bambalamber> Yeah when I order gluten free most places warn me they're like all fried in the same oil
[2023-01-10 00:35:40] <%+DrKatieRat> surprisingly, McDonald's doesn't.
[2023-01-10 00:35:40] <wtersign> mcdonald's in nz keeps there frying oil for french fries separate to the meat that they fry
[2023-01-10 00:35:41] VIEWERS: 2 735
[2023-01-10 00:35:43] <%+SG816> @simparker my best friend worked at DQ and I couldn't eat there when they had shrimp, because they used the same oil for everything and I'm severely allergic
[2023-01-10 00:35:45] <%FruityCrows> Not where I am, but a lot of people are vegan here in Sweden
[2023-01-10 00:35:46] <%yema_ema> @1mp3rfectb0y reusing oil is actually extremely common practice
[2023-01-10 00:35:51] <+i7_pow2908> oh really, in australia in most fast food we have a double fryer for fries and then a 4 fryer for chicken products
[2023-01-10 00:35:51] <%+cupiditi> McDonald’s fry OIL is vegetable but the fries are made with animal product
[2023-01-10 00:36:06] <%saurusness> at least in europe mcdonnalds has to have separate friers for anything with common alllergens (i.e. fish or breaded stuff) and fries saurusnessEyes
[2023-01-10 00:36:09] [Notification] RiisYoung subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months!
[2023-01-10 00:36:09] <%+Hera450> can confirm. I used to work in a kitchen and we used the same fryer for everything except fish
[2023-01-10 00:36:11] <%$lilthxavier> vege oil
[2023-01-10 00:36:12] <@%brewwin> there was a tiktok of someone allergic to canola and trying to find someone didnt use canola oil. impossible poor canola allergies
[2023-01-10 00:36:13] <$julraine> I wish I was vegan but you can’t get any decent priced vegan items here at all so I just don’t eat meat
[2023-01-10 00:36:15] <%+DrKatieRat> Yeah, the fries aren't vegan.
[2023-01-10 00:36:17] <%+talisha200> the uk mcdonald fries are fried in seperate friers
[2023-01-10 00:36:19] <%$jo_poop> !bingo

[2023-01-10 00:36:26] <%+merridybb> i work at a college dining hall and we fry all of our things in the same frier unless people specifically ask for it to be vegan
[2023-01-10 00:36:26] <%sirmixnone> As a professional server we use the same frier
[2023-01-10 00:36:26] <thisiskatithink> We’ve come full circle
[2023-01-10 00:36:26] <%peachytorii> its most likely the oil is gluten free or vegan but the baskets are always in use and cross contamination
[2023-01-10 00:36:27] <%jessorjuice> do you have any vegan restaurants around you
[2023-01-10 00:36:28] <%little_miss_anxiety> angus go away i need people on my card
[2023-01-10 00:36:28] <+aiphana1> Is Dan vegan?
[2023-01-10 00:36:29] <+Smilinsteph83> there has been alot of food talk this stream
[2023-01-10 00:36:31] <+yanjii> probably in german restaurants they do it better lol
[2023-01-10 00:36:32] <%+emimadi17> how often does dan have non-vegan food?
[2023-01-10 00:36:33] <%$samanthaverb> wait they have KFC in the UK?
[2023-01-10 00:36:35] <onetiredbeing> angus is coming up way too much today
[2023-01-10 00:36:35] <@%ItIsDanya> portillos use a different fryer but the oil is with beef stuff
[2023-01-10 00:36:38] <%RiisYoung> Ooo I like your sub badges!
[2023-01-10 00:36:38] <%plantsy> food contamination is scary

[2023-01-10 00:36:44] <$raylord2002> McDonald’s in aus uses one fryer for meat and one fryer for potato products, so it’s pretty good here, but we had a vegetarian patty that was fried in the same oil as the chicken and fish
[2023-01-10 00:36:45] <%$River_Styx19> right as we were talking about burgers too
[2023-01-10 00:36:46] <@%Little_Dica> KFC is amazing here in italy as well
[2023-01-10 00:36:47] <AmandaJean87> I know a place where ur food gos on the floor and u get 2 eat it
[2023-01-10 00:36:47] <@%brewwin> you kno who likes KFC the most? JAPAN
[2023-01-10 00:36:48] <@%goosekingdom> i had vegan wings yesterday and they put a dOWEL IN THEM!!!!!!! i was upset
[2023-01-10 00:36:50] <%+JustCallMeNerdy> Someone mentioned allergies, most large restaurants (and Starbucks in particular) have a warning in the fine print about cross contamination. Like Starbucks has a pistachio thing happening now i think? So now it’s nit nut allergy free because the syrup is made with real pistachio unlike their other nut flavored syrups
[2023-01-10 00:36:50] <broccoli_robz> when i went to iceland i got taco bell lmao
[2023-01-10 00:36:54] <andyrogyny> the fryer oil thing is a big issue for people with gluten intolerance/celiac too
[2023-01-10 00:36:54] <@%brewwin> KFC was the thing in the 70s
[2023-01-10 00:36:54] <%+JoyInAbility> kfc is super popular in Japan too
[2023-01-10 00:36:54] <veja1> they have kfc in almost all Europe
[2023-01-10 00:36:54] <%+DrKatieRat> KFC is huge in China.
[2023-01-10 00:36:57] <%+kristastarr> Japan loves KFC
[2023-01-10 00:36:57] <@%Little_Dica> I've heard US friends being horrible but i love it here
[2023-01-10 00:36:57] <%Jeais> KFC is all over the world
[2023-01-10 00:36:59] <%$lilthxavier> @mandanaismoi depends on the macdonalds
[2023-01-10 00:36:59] <wtersign> KFC isnt popular in America?
[2023-01-10 00:37:00] <%$naiveindividual> KFC is big everywhere other than the US
[2023-01-10 00:37:00] <%little_miss_anxiety> yeah Japan LOVES KFC

[2023-01-10 00:37:02] <@%+MrsTomato101814> @brewwin one of my college roommates was allergic to canola!! and this was when so many places switched from peanut oil to canola oil. it was awful trying to find places for us to eat
[2023-01-10 00:37:02] <%samanthalovescats> apparently kfc having mac and cheese is not normal outside of the US???

[2023-01-10 00:37:03] <%Dawnie3296> I have a lot of allergies, Crohn's & TMAU so I buy more vegan alternatives I found Daiya when I was still living in Vancouver (where they are from) because I wanted Caesar Salad.
[2023-01-10 00:37:04] <smollbabyangel> kfc is popular in europe yea

[2023-01-10 00:37:59] <%songbear1> when the sims team added the update where they separated lot traits and lot challenges I felt like they should do that with the vegetarian trains and glutton free traits in the sims 4
[2023-01-10 00:38:00] <%+HistoriCLC> I feel like KFC was popular in the U.S. in the early 2000s and has gone down since.

[2023-01-10 00:42:44] <%missrileybear> As a non vegan I’m curious what is it in the beyond and impossible meat patties because I wanna try some vegan food but I’m really picky
[2023-01-10 00:42:47] <+laezytitan> I think morning star rebranded to look more like beyond chicken
[2023-01-10 00:42:47] <%Dawnie3296> If you need to raise your BP by all means do get them.

[2023-01-10 22:02:11] <%$moosiegal> Okay, so yesterday I said that Wisteria was bad luck but then I went and did additional research and found that it's more around lost love and the ability to endure lost love and immortality. But also Wisteria itself is an invasive plant that chokes out other plants to live, so it can also be seen as a symbol of overly passionate/obsessive love

[2023-01-10 22:19:41] <%+mcat11> At this point I think it would need to be a game pack at the very least and it may be western themed at this point since we already have a farm pack

[2023-01-10 22:20:26] <%$moosiegal> Okay, so last week I said that Wisteria was bad luck but then I went and did additional research and found that it's more around lost love and the ability to endure lost love and immortality. But also Wisteria itself is an invasive plant that chokes out other plants to live, so it can also be seen as a symbol of overly passionate/obsessive love

[2023-01-10 22:21:31] <wi770ughby> I feel like the bear will be the sims version of tooth fairy, that fits with generations
[2023-01-10 22:21:32] <matanm03> You can change the male last name under mc pregnancy
[2023-01-10 22:21:33] <+yanjii> the nail polish add was so good tho
[2023-01-10 22:21:34] <valiushhka> hii
[2023-01-10 22:21:35] <%+cadence_underfield> wait teeth and bears stuffed bears and teething it could be the infants
[2023-01-10 22:21:35] <sydneyt04> my hs years is broken and its so sad
[2023-01-10 22:21:35] <@%goosekingdom> what if the free update is a whale, like a singular one
[2023-01-10 22:21:36] <%+JamesHatesPeaches> @MrsTomato101814 omg 'tooths'? I meant teeth hahaha @MrsTomato101814
[2023-01-10 22:21:36] <%+adombear> simsieAHH simsieAHH
[2023-01-10 22:21:38] <fatcow97> Omg I would love hotels in island living just like sims 3
[2023-01-10 22:21:38] <mklilfunny> i wish thogh
[2023-01-10 22:21:39] <alm4palma> how much does ur house cost??
[2023-01-10 22:21:40] <cozybean123> the tree in the background.... its giving family tree🤞🤞
[2023-01-10 22:21:41] <%endakat> I hope they do another pack refresh
[2023-01-10 22:21:41] <@%brewwin> question: do you think they did the refresh FOR the collab or is that just like way too much time in between and a make up
[2023-01-10 22:21:42] <amberhelena> @roguetownie Clever
[2023-01-10 22:21:44] <LeonieB94> it would be great though. make granite Falls a residential world
[2023-01-10 22:21:44] <elphenda> Caribbean world in an expansion with hotels and donkeys
[2023-01-10 22:21:47] <%$Plourde4> Probably not. Unless they see some real movement for it.
[2023-01-10 22:21:48] <lilangie91> @fatcow97 simsie did a video on it. check her YT 😄
[2023-01-10 22:21:48] <CygnetAlpheratz> i hope the pack includes the tooth fairy and it's a bear for some reason
[2023-01-10 22:21:50] <isabell_b02> what would be cool the criminal career but in aktiv mode
[2023-01-10 22:21:51] <%sulsulsunflower> I think you're right unfortunately
[2023-01-10 22:21:52] <%+95Capricorn> I'm not sure it was well marketed that there was a refresh, because I had no idea

[2023-01-10 22:21:55] <%+CPgremlin> i think they just fixated on teeth as a characteristic of age. newborns have no teeth, then toddlers learn to brush, kids lose teeth, and elders have dentures
[2023-01-10 22:21:57] <%$sarcasticsoprano_7> they should've led with a better one

[2023-01-10 22:22:05] <%Missygirl93> If they refreshed Dine out it would have gone better!
[2023-01-10 22:22:05] <XlNYUE> capitalism strikes again
[2023-01-10 22:22:05] <casually_maddie> I wish we got more pack refreshes we lowkey need a couple more
[2023-01-10 22:22:05] <@%^Moobot> SAVE AND SIP! simsieTea
[2023-01-10 22:22:07] <%$meganlovesgames> Dine Out really really needs one
[2023-01-10 22:22:08] <%+bex2600> there are so many teeth teasers
[2023-01-10 22:22:09] <%+purplebeccles> I really liked the refresh but I'l really worried you're correct
[2023-01-10 22:22:09] <elesinia> kaylaaa your cats gonna run away 🥹😭 😭 your making me wanna log in the sims and look after my sims cat 😂
[2023-01-10 22:22:11] <%+herewegoajenn> I think you're right
[2023-01-10 22:22:14] <mcufangal> I wish they would cause I DID get spa day after the refresh
[2023-01-10 22:22:14] <%$elliebear__> yeah because the main reason for them to do refreshes is to sell more of the pack
[2023-01-10 22:22:15] <%lucyhannah36> gotta think of the money first
[2023-01-10 22:22:18] <+yanjii> if they didnt make 20 of everything maybe more people would buy spa day lol
[2023-01-10 22:22:18] <fatcow97> @lilangie91 thank you!
[2023-01-10 22:22:18] <saphisscared> they should've given a refresh to packs that NEED it tbh
[2023-01-10 22:22:19] <@%goosekingdom> i guess im fine with that if we keep getting new and interesting content that worKS
[2023-01-10 22:22:20] <%sulsulsunflower> I don't think spa day was the one they should have tried it with
[2023-01-10 22:22:21] <%+punkin_builds> Jan 31st cannot come soon enough I just hope it doesn’t disappoint

[2023-01-10 22:22:26] <%$dru_skellyington> yes we do know how 'great' the sims is at being sneaky....*proceeds to see new leak online*  gluLOL
[2023-01-10 22:22:29] <matilda_2203> There is no way the sims team doesn’t know that we want refreshes of some packs but why aren’t they doing it argh

[2023-01-10 22:22:30] <sydneyt04> they need to fix hs years
[2023-01-10 22:22:30] <%$Plourde4> I just want them to fix previous packs
[2023-01-10 22:22:30] <@%Little_Dica> LOL it is
[2023-01-10 22:22:30] <irinaloredana> take care of the cat
[2023-01-10 22:22:30] <another_you24> Maybe its an expansion expansion pack with a dentist career, baby teeth and fairy/tooth fairy occult.
[2023-01-10 22:22:31] <@%brewwin> it could just be a refresh takes the same time and manpower as new content and its not worth it
[2023-01-10 22:22:31] <%$seafoampudding_> yeah i think the refresh could've been more beneficial with a different pack but that's just my opinion
[2023-01-10 22:22:31] <sarahsydney> Goldilocks and 3 bears fantasy pack!
[2023-01-10 22:22:32] <@%+MrsTomato101814> @elesinia please stop spamming about the cat!
[2023-01-10 22:22:32] <martheber> Which pack needs it the most?
[2023-01-10 22:22:33] <raex_ch> dine out needs one, it needs to be fixed actually
[2023-01-10 22:22:33] <%+sophielovescoffeeanddogs> dont think its worth it for them bc many people have the packs already
[2023-01-10 22:22:33] <%+RogueTownie> If all they give us is a dentist career I will be displeased.
[2023-01-10 22:22:33] <%+lxhvli> did you find wart. jr yesterday?
[2023-01-10 22:22:36] <616jacey> They need to just refresh the whole game period
[2023-01-10 22:22:36] <+Cozapalmtree> I would buy get to work  or get together if they refreshed it
[2023-01-10 22:22:37] <%+nicci1493> I like the YouTube comments that the bear is quite molar bear like polar bear but it's the sims version of the tooth fairy
[2023-01-10 22:22:37] <%+adombear> i just got eco life style whats some fun stuff i might not know about?
[2023-01-10 22:22:38] <%+chloet877> too nice for EA
[2023-01-10 22:22:38] <AntonioE777> It's hard to determine how profitable it'd be compared to a new pack
[2023-01-10 22:22:39] <%$sarcasticsoprano_7> very unlike EA
[2023-01-10 22:22:41] <%+see_a_mess47> especially when they couldve just added nail polish and stuff to a different pack
[2023-01-10 22:22:41] <um_vada> she needa take care of that damn cat lmaooo
[2023-01-10 22:22:42] <%42hitch42> They have to make money off of it to justify doing it again. There are people to pay, after all.
[2023-01-10 22:22:45] <%+sophielovescoffeeanddogs> time's better invested in new paided content
[2023-01-10 22:22:46] <%wizegirlsmb> Someone said zoo because of the bear and there was a grim reaper post with animals on him.
[2023-01-10 22:22:47] <%breashleigh> I would love to have the pets pack refreshed. More accessories and beds and cat trees and toys would be life changing
[2023-01-10 22:22:47] <sunnysideupper> Pack refreshes make way more sense now with the free base game.

But also Wisteria itself is an invasive plant that chokes out other plants to live, so it can also be seen as a symbol of overly passionate/obsessive love

[2023-01-10 22:44:34] <+thatguyth0ugh> if you max programming you can binge research which builds all skills at the same time
[2023-01-10 22:44:35] <nugsutin_> would it fit the story if she drop out?

[2023-01-10 22:44:37] <%+MsSimsAlot> I wouldn’t do college
[2023-01-10 22:44:38] <@%+MrsTomato101814> the orange gen certainly doesnt need college
[2023-01-10 22:44:39] <%+peachysmeachy> she's missing work

[2023-01-10 22:44:47] <@%^Moobot> @MrsTomato101814 I made a legacy challenge with my friend Zoë called the Not So Berry Challenge! You can check out the rules here: http://lilsimsie.tumblr.com/post/157671494755/not-so-berry-legacy-challenge
[2023-01-10 22:44:48] <chickenpox_CLOUT> this is the only gen where we don’t have to max a career so what’s the point
[2023-01-10 22:44:49] <%Missygirl93> Maybe take 1 class
[2023-01-10 22:44:50] <%livstardust> she would stay with the baby
[2023-01-10 22:44:51] <%+darth_jesweak> I love the orange gen lol
[2023-01-10 22:44:52] <%+smooth_tortoise> You only need level 3 in 3 careers for aspiration
[2023-01-10 22:44:53] <dancing_octopus> could learn skills that way thoigh
[2023-01-10 22:44:54] <ztellza> Is it on short pic span?
[2023-01-10 22:44:54] <%rinnyphoo> It's very jarring to see Barney out of his bear costume
[2023-01-10 22:44:55] <%asinineTwins> plum doesn't need to max any careers so i don't think she needs college
[2023-01-10 22:44:56] <%+see_a_mess47> maybe in a different gen when you have to max a career
[2023-01-10 22:44:56] <froggyballs101> Bonnie seems more of a college person I miss her
[2023-01-10 22:44:58] <ericafc> it just really helps with building so many different skills
[2023-01-10 22:44:59] <@%+MrsTomato101814> @chickenpox_CLOUT okay thatsa good point
[2023-01-10 22:45:01] <mcufangal> All in all I’m just another cat on the wall

[2023-01-10 22:49:34] <%+wrensamphire> @thatgirlrobin also there are ways to swing the gender, e.g. listening to pop increases girl chances... so you might be doing a boy thing?
[2023-01-10 22:49:35] <@%+MrsTomato101814> i genuinely want to try the 100 baby challenge after the infant update drops

[2023-01-10 22:51:37] <RadFoolish> should make the sibling with the highest relashonship with the baby take care of wisteria after parents die

[2023-01-10 23:27:15] <Jaded_Junimo> In middle school I got called over to the computer & there was a picture of a hyena on it and they said “look it’s your cousin” because of my laugh
[2023-01-10 23:27:16] <itsn0tjames> people used to make fun of me for having no eyebrows (i was extremely blonde as a kid so my eyebrows were invisible)
[2023-01-10 23:27:17] <%finch4hearts> i think this chat is a lot of younger teens which are the meanest. i gave a presentation to some middle schoolers and one of them said "why are you a boy who sounds like a girl."

[2023-01-10 23:31:16] <%+blueshellfromhell> let's get back to the teeth conversations... simsieParty simsieParty
[2023-01-10 23:31:16] <+morepanthers> a friend came over who used to play Sims 2 in high school with me and she was so excited to hear Sims 4 was free now
[2023-01-10 23:31:17] <%cassidyleighh> yea i've been playing the sims since it came out and will continue to play it
[2023-01-10 23:31:18] <%+pugmomma93> Saying “20’s-40’s ect” okay?
[2023-01-10 23:31:20] <eiocha> it's true, I know someone who got banned for joking and saying they were underage - a good rule
[2023-01-10 23:31:21] <%+meganj0208> I’m glad you make your community safe for the kiddos ❤️
[2023-01-10 23:31:22] <%trsosa_> i don’t understand why some people think it’s childish to play the sims
[2023-01-10 23:31:23] <drMarchew> i play only battlefield but I watch all of your content 😆
[2023-01-10 23:31:24] <%$bobpancakesmistress> I remember my mom as a kid would have the sims running on the family desktop computer and would pause it and walk away to do chores and whatnot. then in college I found myself also leaving the game paused in the background all the time
[2023-01-10 23:31:25] <+jdeasternkntcky81> lets just say this... I have played the sims since 2001 (came out when I was in college) ... this year marks 20 years since I graduated college... so yeah... I'm old and play sims ... :)
[2023-01-10 23:31:26] <%Clare_eliz21> I think anyone can play sims!! Whos to judge🤷🏽‍♀️
[2023-01-10 23:31:27] <@%^Moobot> simsieNo NO, DO THIS! CHANGE THIS! EWWWW! Backseat gaming is NEVER allowed. Suggestions are always appreciated, but do not attempt to make demands or force Kayla to do anything. There is a difference between friendly suggestions and aggressive demands. Ultimately she is the one playing the game, not you! simsieNo
[2023-01-10 23:31:32] <%sunflowerben> I appreciate the age chat rules! My kiddo heard you talk about it once and see really internalized it

[2023-01-10 23:33:30] <topazure_> the amount of people that judge me for playing minecraft at times as an adult 🤷‍♀️ and sims lol
[2023-01-10 23:33:31] <BentonLikesCommas> if you can graduate HS early, does that mean you can be a child prodigy in University?

[2023-01-10 23:33:31] <%+aussie_armstrong> you have to be very sad inside to ridicule other people's joy
[2023-01-10 23:33:31] <%$Theresevers> i was told i was weird because i like kpop, and that something must be wrong with me becasue i find them attractive....
[2023-01-10 23:33:32] <SummerSimz> As long as it isn’t hurting anyone, people should not judge anybody for anything
[2023-01-10 23:33:32] <%trsosa_> the curfew thing is not the same as sims 3 when the parents would run outside and ground you as soon as you get home

[2023-01-10 23:33:43] <reilly188> depends on if the passion is worse
[2023-01-10 23:33:44] <%SydTheButton> Also I feel the sims is more driven to be an adult game that kids also happen to like. But I do feel it’s an adult game lol

[2023-01-10 23:34:19] <%finch4hearts> i think a lot of people  think "why play the sims when you can just live your life." idk brad why do you watch football when you can just go outside and toss the old pigskin round

[2023-01-10 23:35:22] <maddycat102607> i think that would be so much fun! all plum wooo!!!
[2023-01-10 23:35:23] <lori_beri> yeah I am always embarrassed to tell people I play the sims because it's considered to be an 'easy' game, apparently if you're not playing violent strategic games all times, you're not cool lol

[2023-01-10 23:53:41] <%+ChontoTheDestroyer> Why is that stuff floating? Is a shelf missing?
[2023-01-10 23:53:43] <matanm03> What skills are we working on?

[2023-01-10 23:53:50] <%mallowsauce> It’s so upsetting that my commute takes up an hour of your stream

[2023-01-10 23:54:04] <%+crossims3112> hope they fix the terrain paint bug as well
[2023-01-10 23:54:04] <%magix532> the moving while paused is soo scary
[2023-01-10 23:54:04] <%simsbygia> the sims 4 main menu lol it says a new expansion pack is "joining the family"
[2023-01-10 23:54:04] <%+coeurdechoeur> @fernandanino22 No mom though
[2023-01-10 23:54:04] <%+tycho900> and the wants/fears

[2023-01-10 23:54:53] <celine_catherine> @elsa950_ yeah I don’t know why, but it just wouldn’t let me use origin anymore, there weren’t any problems with the switch for me though
