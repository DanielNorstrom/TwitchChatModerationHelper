[2022-12-08 20:47:01] <+stefthegreek> CAR only good if fully kitted. Stick with R301
[2022-12-08 20:47:03] <FourTwentyFgt> the car is literally taken over shotguns as a secondary. the car is the best gun
[2022-12-08 20:47:06] <%+burniebow> volt is the BEST! i will not have any discussion on this

[2022-12-08 20:47:42] <wetponch0> Wingman is mostly for console/controller for aim assist advantage

[2022-12-08 20:54:23] <chaveeees> the point is switch ADS and hipfire while shoot when very close
[2022-12-08 20:54:33] <frax______> you want to ADS with the R301. no ads with the 301 is quite shit
[2022-12-08 20:54:40] <SeventhFrost> ads at mid range is good, but move still
[2022-12-08 20:54:40] <frax______> depends on the gun

[2022-12-08 21:07:38] <SeventhFrost> can basically ignore attachments that aren't scopes or mags
[2022-12-08 21:08:13] <OfficialTolkien> they should classify every weapon as ar smg lmg and sniper and just have the same attachments for each of those classification

[2022-12-08 21:51:06] <@100Thieves> for people who paid for the hoodie - please whisper the 100T account
[2022-12-08 21:51:06] <+SovereignDSC> so looks like some of us ended up paying for it because the code didnt work first time
[2022-12-08 21:51:15] <@100Thieves> for people who paid for the hoodie - please whisper the 100T account
[2022-12-08 21:51:16] <@100Thieves> for people who paid for the hoodie - please whisper the 100T account
[2022-12-08 21:51:18] <@100Thieves> for people who paid for the hoodie - please whisper the 100T account
[2022-12-08 21:51:24] <+HeyTaXi7> All good. 100T doesn't even have to do this, so even if it didn't work it is what it is.
[2022-12-08 21:51:24] <~%Hiko> ^^^
[2022-12-08 21:51:27] <~%Hiko> they will handle

[2022-12-08 21:51:59] <lordgrimxo> <3
[2022-12-08 21:52:01] <+Lizveth> at least it was a really funny confusion
[2022-12-08 21:52:22] <+Streelder> @100Thieves why are these giveaways always for US only
[2022-12-08 21:52:34] <+Streelder> sadge
[2022-12-08 21:52:37] <Aremdy> @Streelder yea Sadge
[2022-12-08 21:52:49] <+hokage_prime> love you Hiko, TY for sick sweatshirt
[2022-12-08 21:53:21] <+Shhn86> @Streelder SUPER expensive to ship overseas, never worth for companies
[2022-12-08 21:54:01] <+Streelder> I understand but it is a way of Marketing and branding your company. You dont wanna know how many EU people are watching 100T streamers.
[2022-12-08 21:54:11] <+Streelder> And because it's marketing its a write-off anyway
[2022-12-08 21:54:58] <+SkirmishX> @Streelder lol they make half a milly per drop
[2022-12-08 21:54:59] <Nindrone> mostly cuz shipping is expensive asf
[2022-12-08 21:55:03] <+SkirmishX> even more
[2022-12-08 21:55:29] <Nindrone> and giveaway laws are different in other countries
[2022-12-08 21:55:56] <+Streelder> giving a code out to get it for free is allowed everywhere
[2022-12-08 21:57:38] <%+Xandeau> im super confused did anyone actuakky get it for free?
