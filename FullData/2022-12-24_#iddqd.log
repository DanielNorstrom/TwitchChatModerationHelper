[2022-12-24 08:30:14] <!%Born_On_A_Monday> Cheer500 We're locked in and endless spiral, time is a flat circle, and one ripple does not change the direction of the current. Fate is a poor word to describe the march twards death we all engage in, finding fleeting moments of happiness while hanging plastic baubles onto the corpse of the evergreen. Almost mockingly to tell it that despite every ring on it's trunk, every year it stands tall and every season it weathers it is, through my actions, mortal... Merry Christmas.

[2022-12-24 09:24:03] <%Llynok> Hog kinda forces high tier teams to play Ana or Zen
[2022-12-24 09:24:06] <Meek1232> I go Orisa from the start LUL
[2022-12-24 09:24:08] <%$Chevyrebel79> Not to mention the only people that liked the hog meta was hog players
[2022-12-24 09:24:13] <+redwings944> Orisa javelin saves hooked teammates often and is unhookable with golden form
[2022-12-24 09:24:14] <l0po> Ana can f hog easily

[2022-12-24 09:24:17] <M0rtemx> Hog always had a one shot, why is it widely considered op now in OW2?

[2022-12-24 09:24:53] <Stepsies> @M0rtemx it was still considered op before, but now there is 1 less hero on the team which makes a single pick more important
[2022-12-24 09:24:55] <burbous> yeah because Orisa can pressure Hog harder and she can counter play his heal with the spear
[2022-12-24 09:25:08] <AvgSalaryMan> i think because ow2 has one tanks and less shield
[2022-12-24 09:25:11] <Ashtins> Counters hook too

[2022-12-24 09:25:40] <AvgSalaryMan> ow2 has less shield so hog can dominate

[2022-12-24 09:30:01] <%$Chevyrebel79> Without mercy echo is usually pretty bad. Still has burst damage to get one but then has no cooldowns
[2022-12-24 09:30:04] <+Golstan> huh
[2022-12-24 09:30:09] <%CRminus> Never seen a good echo player tho
[2022-12-24 09:30:11] <Hoboleenus> Only on some maps where she can sky-sneak
[2022-12-24 09:30:13] <louisdays6> youre right, worse than torb tho
[2022-12-24 09:30:20] <%carnalacarolina> in the stky she is easy to hit

[2022-12-24 09:30:31] <EskiMorris> echo has been feeling good this patch but she deserve her mid tier, worse than torb
[2022-12-24 09:30:33] <shikstwich> pharah better than echo?
[2022-12-24 09:30:36] <%sirkibble13> I agree she is much more vulnerable in general. She is more needy and can’t sustain herself like torb can
[2022-12-24 09:30:46] <holmezyyy> Echo is kinda underrated but I think mid tier for her is completely fine yea
[2022-12-24 09:30:47] <EskiMorris> i feel like they can trade off map dependant
[2022-12-24 09:31:02] <julia_obeeeyy2> Finally add dun lol
[2022-12-24 09:31:03] <%Kataclysm__> i think mercy should be more than decent tbh, she provides so much, but i suppose if its what they can do *themself* not putting her there makes sense
[2022-12-24 09:31:05] <%sirkibble13> She needs someone to save her after she gets a burst kill
[2022-12-24 09:31:07] <AvgSalaryMan> ECHO is so good
[2022-12-24 09:31:13] <%CRminus> she is a bit to squishy
[2022-12-24 09:31:18] <opaque_jake> i think she can usually trade up

[2022-12-24 09:39:25] <isacksenn> ramattra kinda needs hard pocket to get value
[2022-12-24 09:39:26] <%CRminus> Winton feels beter pressure alone then ramatra
[2022-12-24 09:39:29] <FL_FLAMES_> Yh you’ll need a mercy pocket or something for max value on ram

[2022-12-24 09:42:20] <VikingJackAU> @iddqd Ashe is hitscan right? Some streamers say Ashe is not being hitscan because of something about a delay on her shot or something, I thought it was a troll be they seemed serious

[2022-12-24 09:46:24] <%loyalenv0y> zarya used to be S tier what happened?

[2022-12-24 09:46:29] <urbanned1> zarya worse than winston?
[2022-12-24 09:46:31] <username_needed> zarya went from top to bottom in one patch KEKW
[2022-12-24 09:46:32] <%iceblackteaa> but zarya has a place in the meta
[2022-12-24 09:46:35] <%+Alsadair> ball players SEETHING iddKek
[2022-12-24 09:46:39] <jjbroke00> I’m a bit confused as to why winston is in D tier because they used him in overwatch league…is there comp not suppose to be META?
[2022-12-24 09:46:39] <andrei863> zarya needs to be evicerated out of the game if u ask me :#
[2022-12-24 09:46:39] <%Kataclysm__> remember when zarya was meta XD
[2022-12-24 09:46:40] <%+SvipkeTV> Wait! Why is Zarya so low? Wasn't she in top 2 recently?
[2022-12-24 09:46:46] <reagan__> junker queen is the best dps character
[2022-12-24 09:46:49] <%updownstep> coxFlorida iddB
[2022-12-24 09:46:50] <+datswassup> zarya def okay
[2022-12-24 09:46:51] <Meek1232> idk about better than JQ

[2022-12-24 09:46:53] <VikingJackAU> Yeah I agree with Zarya as okay
[2022-12-24 09:46:55] <%+IV_PREDATOR_VI> you need one more tier between okay and middlefolk
[2022-12-24 09:46:57] <%loyalenv0y> @iddqd Can you explain why Zarya is so low?
[2022-12-24 09:46:58] <+슈니츠 (schn1tz)> so what about Chazm @iddqd
[2022-12-24 09:47:01] <%ElGatoMatador> think shes better than jq tho
[2022-12-24 09:47:02] <+SuperMannyPrime> sorry for asking you to repeat yourself but why do u think zarya is so bad
[2022-12-24 09:47:03] <username_needed> zarya has to be better than JQ
[2022-12-24 09:47:05] <%Smacky20> 🐹 wtf man
[2022-12-24 09:47:08] <Ski751> Zarys wasn't even op before her nerfs, people were just bad at playing vs her
[2022-12-24 09:47:08] <dabeeestkuhehehe> how does zarya even get energy in the high tiers when everyone doesn't shoot her?
[2022-12-24 09:47:08] <BakedZnake> zarya can have more damage and bubbles off junker Queen abilities, no way she's worse
[2022-12-24 09:47:09] <kaoz11_> Zariya has no place in this meta
[2022-12-24 09:47:13] <FL_FLAMES_> Zarya in the dust lol
[2022-12-24 09:47:17] <Jiimby> why genji not 2nd tier, sorry just got here
[2022-12-24 09:47:17] <+ciikp> shes out of meta but not worse than JQ, just other characters power creep more and make her look weak
[2022-12-24 09:47:20] <%ElGatoMatador> zarya ult cant be negated so easily
[2022-12-24 09:47:28] <funchases6> HamJam
[2022-12-24 09:47:29] <username_needed> zarya actually has a useful ult, JQ's is too easy to counter
[2022-12-24 09:47:32] <%ElGatoMatador> and its not super slow charge rate

[2022-12-24 09:55:27] <%+Volker73> That would be too much with his TP

[2022-12-24 09:55:28] <+Nnnxia> that is why moira is a big boss
[2022-12-24 09:55:29] <%+SvipkeTV> It would be insane surprise mechanic
[2022-12-24 09:55:31] <%ElGatoMatador> that would be cancer lmao

[2022-12-24 09:55:43] <DONOTREADMYLONGASSNAME> monkaStop dont give them ideas
[2022-12-24 09:55:44] <%sirkibble13> Reaper disappears iddB
[2022-12-24 09:55:46] <%+izabelabl> Sombra is below bottom of the barrel
[2022-12-24 09:55:46] <%Ligh1_1> @iddqd i like his shift , he can get healed in it
[2022-12-24 09:55:48] <%sir_kil_alott> Moira shift into reaper ult
[2022-12-24 09:55:49] <burbous> I'd prob be on valorant
[2022-12-24 09:55:54] <Sw000n> pre patch shift lol so you cant jump 50 feet up
[2022-12-24 09:55:54] <%alenaistyping> hanzo have no damage fall off and range i think he deserves to be in okay tier but he need slight buff. i saix already. he need faster charge on arrow
[2022-12-24 09:55:55] <andrei863> imagin shifting with his ultimate
[2022-12-24 09:55:55] <Springtrapsu> imagine if it resets if get a kill
[2022-12-24 09:55:57] <andrei863> kekw
[2022-12-24 09:55:58] <%CRminus> The teleport just needs to be a bit faster
[2022-12-24 09:55:58] <+Lostsoldier271> This game would turn into a horror game lol
[2022-12-24 09:56:02] <Jaeducks> moira shift on anyone will be disgusting

[2022-12-24 09:56:19] <+romer94> it would be unfair especially with the way his ult works
[2022-12-24 09:56:21] <+Coco234> @iddqd if you havent done vod reviews yet, can i suggest to review my plat genji vod
[2022-12-24 09:56:30] <VikingJackAU> Where does sym go PauseChamp
[2022-12-24 09:56:32] <Meek1232> @Jaeducks Remember the experimental patch where Moira could shift the entire team LUL
[2022-12-24 09:56:32] <Jaeducks> @Jaeducks no invul
[2022-12-24 09:56:38] <%loyalenv0y> @iddqd soldier better then reaper?
[2022-12-24 09:56:49] <%CRminus> Bab has more dmg output overal
[2022-12-24 09:56:50] <dl_238> Bap maine here.....Reaper aint shit if I have the lamp
[2022-12-24 09:56:58] <Jaeducks> @Jaeducks LUL
[2022-12-24 09:56:59] <Dracksar> @VikingJackAU deleted from the game hopefully
[2022-12-24 09:57:04] <%CRminus> ye
[2022-12-24 09:57:05] <+Dropsies1> I agree
[2022-12-24 09:57:10] <langitpinagkait> fair point
[2022-12-24 09:57:10] <+ClefTheMouse> po
[2022-12-24 09:57:12] <%alenaistyping> you guys dont understand that reaper have to fight in the face
[2022-12-24 09:57:12] <TacticalPew> yea
[2022-12-24 09:57:12] <+familyyguy> definitely
[2022-12-24 09:57:16] <Sw000n> yeah just because of the midrange pressure
[2022-12-24 09:57:16] <%YellowSign1> If you play full rush then Reaper can still go hard
[2022-12-24 09:57:19] <%ElGatoMatador> depends on map tbh but generally yeah
[2022-12-24 09:57:22] <%iceblackteaa> depends on how smart the reaper player is imo
[2022-12-24 09:57:28] <Sw000n> same with hanzo
[2022-12-24 09:57:30] <%alenaistyping> if reaper far away he deal 6 damage
[2022-12-24 09:57:30] <%sinsemilla_swe> God jul! @iddqd
[2022-12-24 09:57:33] <VikingJackAU> @Dracksar She gets her ult way too fast, it's up every fight ResidentSleeper
[2022-12-24 09:57:34] <Sw000n> he can just climb a wall lol
[2022-12-24 09:57:43] <!%Harskare> reaper has 2x the guns that bap does though
[2022-12-24 09:57:48] <Meek1232> @alenaistyping Sniping whit Reaper! Pog
[2022-12-24 09:57:58] <langitpinagkait> he has good burst though, and pretty good positioning options with wall climb?
[2022-12-24 09:57:59] <+Dropsies1> hanzo is kinda bad, specially with the bug it has right now
[2022-12-24 09:57:59] <%ElGatoMatador> ehhhh idk hanzo ult kinda sucks
[2022-12-24 09:58:01] <+ClefTheMouse> <-- Reaper main in OW1 for nearly 1800 hours. You are absolutely correct, assuming similar skill levels between the players

[2022-12-24 09:58:50] <+ClefTheMouse> are you ranking each tier left to right too?
[2022-12-24 09:58:50] <Jiimby> reaper sucks
[2022-12-24 09:58:58] <+Dropsies1> technically reaper has infinite guns, cause he spawns new ones every time he shot 4 times with each LUL
[2022-12-24 09:59:00] <Springtrapsu> yeah I hate moira
[2022-12-24 09:59:01] <+Coco234> hanzo is not better than moira
[2022-12-24 09:59:04] <+wojti_mp3> moira is a dps let's be honest
[2022-12-24 09:59:07] <Springtrapsu> and mercy
[2022-12-24 09:59:10] <allenhue2001> Make a separate row for moira named ‘go fuck yourself’
[2022-12-24 09:59:19] <VikingJackAU> @Dracksar Teleporter from spawn, force her to respawn after 5seconds
[2022-12-24 09:59:22] <reagan__> i feel like reaper is better than mcree
[2022-12-24 09:59:23] <Jaeducks> sym > moira
[2022-12-24 09:59:29] <%Kataclysm__> god i love moira but i dont want her buffed, i feel like they would make her horribly broken and i would rather her be meh honestly XD
[2022-12-24 09:59:35] <!%+Shadowfyre> I respectfully disagree lol
[2022-12-24 09:59:37] <dl_238> reaper is better than Moira
[2022-12-24 09:59:42] <%NuggyLife> I think it depends on who plays her

[2022-12-24 09:59:46] <%Curios1tyy> moira has zero value
[2022-12-24 09:59:49] <jjbroke00> Why did they use winston reaper in overwatch league recently?
[2022-12-24 09:59:50] <rankn1ne> You can't kill a tank till you deal with Moira and dealing with Moira is a pain in the ass
[2022-12-24 09:59:57] <+Dropsies1> I would place bastion at the end of middlefolks
[2022-12-24 09:59:58] <Meek1232> No utility
[2022-12-24 10:00:04] <+romer94> i kill it with moira
[2022-12-24 10:00:05] <%nightmare_747> moira is better than cole lol
[2022-12-24 10:00:05] <username_needed> moira is so player dependent
[2022-12-24 10:00:07] VIEWERS: 1 253
[2022-12-24 10:00:10] <Meek1232> She has massive heals though that's it
[2022-12-24 10:00:14] <%+SvipkeTV> Moira can do shitloads of healing for group pushing. Once people spread she drops hard.
[2022-12-24 10:00:20] <%sirkibble13> Hot take the okay category is like marginal differences in performance minus jq
[2022-12-24 10:00:23] <+Coco234> shes diffs hanzo easily
[2022-12-24 10:00:24] <%ElGatoMatador> lamp and revive and both ults are way better than moira
[2022-12-24 10:00:32] <%+EmaniRenee> mei sooo much better im sawrii
[2022-12-24 10:00:36] <+Coco234> moira 1v1s hanzo is every scenario
[2022-12-24 10:00:37] <Sw000n> i think moira is also dependent on her environment for her ball to bounce
[2022-12-24 10:00:39] <sparky6294> Moira doesn’t work with a lot of team comps
[2022-12-24 10:00:40] <Meek1232> Yeah
[2022-12-24 10:00:41] <!%Harskare> dps

[2022-12-24 10:00:48] <funchases6> catYep
[2022-12-24 10:00:56] <+romer94> u can dps with her
[2022-12-24 10:00:58] <dabeeestkuhehehe> moira's better at harassment than actually healing
[2022-12-24 10:01:04] <@%$bojassim_97> moira is best if the team is together
[2022-12-24 10:01:09] <%NuggyLife> I go in circles around others as her
[2022-12-24 10:01:09] <username_needed> she doesn't do enough imo
[2022-12-24 10:01:17] <Hoboleenus> moira is for when your dps isn't killing what they are supposed to, so you have to do it yourself as a flanker-support
[2022-12-24 10:01:25] <+ChippyDippyInMyFlippy> or ana
[2022-12-24 10:01:29] <MegaBronson5000> I would put mei higher
[2022-12-24 10:01:32] <dl_238> Moira tries to be a lot of things all at once....so shes just mediocre at everything
[2022-12-24 10:01:35] <+ChippyDippyInMyFlippy> ana has way more value
[2022-12-24 10:01:35] <Cudsfab4> Below junker queen, not as much value as those above her
[2022-12-24 10:01:36] <sparky6294> Sometimes I pick Moira if our dps is shitting the bed tho
[2022-12-24 10:01:42] <+Coco234> rank zen
[2022-12-24 10:01:52] <username_needed> no speed, no nade, no damage boost, no suzu, no lamp, she doesn't do enough tbh
[2022-12-24 10:02:02] <skinni789> You play Moira when you’re a DPS and get the healer role in open queue
[2022-12-24 10:02:07] VIEWERS: 1 391
[2022-12-24 10:02:26] <+Coco234> do zen

[2022-12-24 10:02:34] <%ElGatoMatador> sombra is trash

[2022-12-24 10:02:36] <VikingJackAU> You play Moria when you have smashed 8 beers and still want to get some value
[2022-12-24 10:02:38] <ArcLight079> sym is pretty popular
[2022-12-24 10:02:39] <username_needed> zen is pretty bad rn

[2022-12-24 10:02:46] <burbous> "Need more data" tier
[2022-12-24 10:02:46] <%ElGatoMatador> zen is bottom of ok
[2022-12-24 10:02:49] <langitpinagkait> he's kinda a healer you pick for damage because both your DPS is ass.
[2022-12-24 10:02:49] <Ski751> Reinhardt SS tier for fun GIGACHAD
[2022-12-24 10:02:51] <%iceblackteaa> maybe you can play sombra and see KappaCool
[2022-12-24 10:02:51] <%CRminus> Zen is to basic rn
[2022-12-24 10:02:53] <DameNightmare> tricky pick though
[2022-12-24 10:02:53] <+datswassup> please put rein in a good place
[2022-12-24 10:02:54] <username_needed> i think he's either end of okay or beginning bottom
[2022-12-24 10:02:55] <+Dropsies1> Sombra used to be hyper broken on beta and blizzard nerfed her to the ground LUL
[2022-12-24 10:02:55] <%+izabelabl> Sombra is absolutely trash since her nerfs
[2022-12-24 10:02:56] <trevory123> seagull has 85% win rate on sym
[2022-12-24 10:02:58] <Jaeducks> sym has a shield
[2022-12-24 10:02:58] <%NuggyLife> I have seen a lot of zen and syms
[2022-12-24 10:02:59] <+Coco234> sym in between rem and dva
[2022-12-24 10:02:59] <+killuazhere> I am a sombra main and I have to tell she’s trash now
[2022-12-24 10:03:01] <%tanjirogoboomboomboom> symmetra is incredibly niche
[2022-12-24 10:03:03] <Hoboleenus> Discord is pretty huge tho

[2022-12-24 10:03:09] <dabeeestkuhehehe> if you don't see them, they're likely bottom
[2022-12-24 10:03:11] <%ElGatoMatador> sym is better than mei imo
[2022-12-24 10:03:11] <ArcLight079> yeah, i would definetely put symmetra in ok
[2022-12-24 10:03:12] <username_needed> sym can do a lot i think
[2022-12-24 10:03:13] <+Coco234> no
[2022-12-24 10:03:16] <%NuggyLife> I don’t really see sombras as much though
[2022-12-24 10:03:16] <+Coco234> shes okay
[2022-12-24 10:03:18] <+Golstan> i live in the bottom of that barrel

[2022-12-24 10:03:26] <MegaBronson5000> Zen is probably top of bottom of barrel
[2022-12-24 10:03:26] <%+IV_PREDATOR_VI> nahhhhhhhhh
[2022-12-24 10:03:28] <%$Chevyrebel79> I think rein/ sombra is bottom of the barrel
[2022-12-24 10:03:28] <Dracksar> bastion FeelsOkayMan
[2022-12-24 10:03:29] <%ElGatoMatador> i take that back but better than bastion
[2022-12-24 10:03:29] <+romer94> he is higher
[2022-12-24 10:03:32] <getric3d> bastions better than hanzo tbh
[2022-12-24 10:03:32] <+Dropsies1> I think bastion is better than hanzo at least
[2022-12-24 10:03:32] <kazuthebeast> there should be another tier for "Situational"
[2022-12-24 10:03:32] <DameNightmare> wh is abstiononly okay when he kills tanks
[2022-12-24 10:03:36] <dabeeestkuhehehe> sombra can't deal any damage, but she is super annoying
[2022-12-24 10:03:36] <langitpinagkait> bastion is combo reliant, but strong
[2022-12-24 10:03:43] <username_needed> just put sombra in bottom of the barrel already KEKW
[2022-12-24 10:03:43] <%ElGatoMatador> sym > bastion
[2022-12-24 10:03:44] <+ChippyDippyInMyFlippy> no
[2022-12-24 10:03:44] <Springtrapsu> what was the 2 beta moira orb called
[2022-12-24 10:03:44] <olegator56> no
[2022-12-24 10:03:45] <dabeeestkuhehehe> should just make her a support
[2022-12-24 10:03:46] <%nightmare_747> bastion individually is bad
[2022-12-24 10:03:46] <urbanned1> NOPERS def not
[2022-12-24 10:03:47] <+Jeffdini> Bastion is okay tier for me
[2022-12-24 10:03:47] <dl_238> bastion needs some kind of movement ability
[2022-12-24 10:03:47] <+Golstan> he is brave
[2022-12-24 10:03:48] <+Dropsies1> He can deal with multiple tanks
[2022-12-24 10:03:48] <+RakijaFAV> yes
[2022-12-24 10:03:49] <%+Volker73> Bastion has his moments
[2022-12-24 10:03:55] <Ho_Lee_Sit> nah bastion is ok
[2022-12-24 10:03:59] <%deansmithereens> no, if youre getting pushed in spawn, he can be clutch
[2022-12-24 10:03:59] <+RakijaFAV> Sym better than bastion
[2022-12-24 10:03:59] <Dracksar> These are just phrases to describe a tier, perhaps the phrasing needs to change
[2022-12-24 10:04:00] <AbsentLemon> his hitbox is too big imo
[2022-12-24 10:04:00] <%+Alsadair> I'd say hes only in okak after they changed his ult
[2022-12-24 10:04:01] <dl_238> hes okay
[2022-12-24 10:04:02] <TacticalPew> better than junker imho
[2022-12-24 10:04:02] <+datswassup> good at melting shields

[2022-12-24 10:04:08] <%$Chevyrebel79> I'd put him right behind hanzo
[2022-12-24 10:04:08] <$trenticles89> Feels like zen has a big hitbox
[2022-12-24 10:04:10] <%+izabelabl> Fitzy said Sombra is trash now, he doesnt play her at all
[2022-12-24 10:04:12] <%NuggyLife> His ult is not that great
[2022-12-24 10:04:15] <+Bakkushan_> surefour plays a lot of bastion
[2022-12-24 10:04:16] <+Deemadork> MrDestructoid You're easy to hit
[2022-12-24 10:04:18] <dabeeestkuhehehe> he's also slow
[2022-12-24 10:04:21] <Cudsfab4> Bastions counters are common sense

[2022-12-24 10:04:24] <salehq27> bastion stomps low elo, that alone is enough to not put him at the bottom
[2022-12-24 10:04:28] <DameNightmare> rather have a bastion than 76 often tbh
[2022-12-24 10:04:30] <cha0tiic> on an individual plan hes bottom with support hes ok
[2022-12-24 10:04:32] <+Coco234> bastion easy to fighjt
[2022-12-24 10:04:33] <dabeeestkuhehehe> I feel like movement speed isn't being considered
[2022-12-24 10:04:34] <+datswassup> save him forlater
[2022-12-24 10:04:35] <+Nnnxia> ow1 bastion better?
[2022-12-24 10:04:42] <dabeeestkuhehehe> being able to get back in the fight 5 seconds faster is huge
[2022-12-24 10:04:42] <Dracksar> bastion can brute force shield tanks which is nice
[2022-12-24 10:04:43] <+Jeffdini> bring back old bastion sadge

[2022-12-24 10:07:02] <%$Chevyrebel79> rein by far the worse tank imo
[2022-12-24 10:07:03] <dl_238> ball is a secondary tank
[2022-12-24 10:07:04] <%ElGatoMatador> ball gets ult really fast
[2022-12-24 10:07:06] <EskiMorris> feels like there should be a tier between okay and bottom of barrel
[2022-12-24 10:07:14] <%+IV_PREDATOR_VI> two top tank players, ball would win

[2022-12-24 10:08:10] <langitpinagkait> zarya at least is threatning, rein just sits there to soak dmg
[2022-12-24 10:08:13] <rankn1ne> she does
[2022-12-24 10:08:18] <%sir_kil_alott> junker queen with buffs is still worse imo

[2022-12-24 10:09:03] <+Gansterchief1> she does. more survivability and her kit is team oriented. plus anti heal. better than rein

[2022-12-24 10:12:05] <dimerase> Rein is best tank
[2022-12-24 10:12:07] <%+IV_PREDATOR_VI> very W take
[2022-12-24 10:12:07] VIEWERS: 1 247
[2022-12-24 10:12:13] <+killuazhere> Sym is B for sure not F
[2022-12-24 10:12:13] <username_needed> kiriko just made him irrelevant
[2022-12-24 10:12:20] <+RakijaFAV> sym is better than sombra bro
[2022-12-24 10:12:24] <%ElGatoMatador> crazy that a kiriko headshot does more than a discord boosted headshot
[2022-12-24 10:12:25] <%+izabelabl> Sym is WAY stronger than Sombra
[2022-12-24 10:12:25] <Ski751> Kirko shouldnt do much dmg then Zen at all
[2022-12-24 10:12:30] <%deansmithereens> bigger kick
[2022-12-24 10:12:31] <dl_238> he sure as hell needs movement
[2022-12-24 10:12:34] <langitpinagkait> do you think a buff with his crit/headshot multiplier, like kiriko, will bump zen up?
[2022-12-24 10:12:34] <MegaBronson5000> Agree on zen
[2022-12-24 10:12:43] <+killuazhere> To be honest if you know how to play sombra good like Fitzy for example you can get the value to the team
[2022-12-24 10:12:44] <Springtrapsu> why when my supports play bad they switch to moira
[2022-12-24 10:12:46] <dabeeestkuhehehe> why is sombra okay? she can't kill anything
[2022-12-24 10:12:47] <%Qnote> Sombra since nerf ir bottom of the barrel baby
[2022-12-24 10:12:51] <FL_FLAMES_> Hot take on moira tbh
[2022-12-24 10:12:54] <psychobuster69> do all heroes need to be viable?
[2022-12-24 10:12:55] <ClaymoreLdr> Sombra is bottom of the barrel for sure. Coming from a sombra main.
[2022-12-24 10:12:56] <+RakijaFAV> yh but she def better than sombra
[2022-12-24 10:13:04] <+RakijaFAV> hell no
[2022-12-24 10:13:16] <getric3d> sym better than sombra tbh
[2022-12-24 10:13:20] <urbanned1> yeah sombra should be bottom
[2022-12-24 10:13:25] <username_needed> i don't know if her kit is better rn
[2022-12-24 10:13:31] <ClaymoreLdr> Damage buff is basically the old dmg
[2022-12-24 10:13:32] <%Qnote> Sombra is the best bottom of the barrel
[2022-12-24 10:13:33] <%ElGatoMatador> give sombra her 40% back against tanks and shes not trash but without that shes just kinda a support killer
[2022-12-24 10:13:34] <%tanjirogoboomboomboom> sombras gun heals the enemy
[2022-12-24 10:13:48] <%+IV_PREDATOR_VI> iddBroken mhm
[2022-12-24 10:13:48] <langitpinagkait> sombra does work if played right
[2022-12-24 10:13:49] <+RakijaFAV> sombra lower and zenyatta and sym ome tier up
[2022-12-24 10:13:49] <funchases6> SadgeCry
[2022-12-24 10:13:52] <ClaymoreLdr> Sombra is best of bottom of the barrel
[2022-12-24 10:13:57] <%+izabelabl> Sombra too is getting reworked
[2022-12-24 10:13:57] <+killuazhere> To be honest if you know how to play sombra good like Fitzy for example you can get the value to the team
[2022-12-24 10:13:59] <%Exodus_BM> @tanjirogoboomboomboom lmao true

[2022-12-24 10:14:17] <ClaymoreLdr> Fitzy is not even playin that much anymore
[2022-12-24 10:14:18] <iAnimae> i love Brig so much though :<
[2022-12-24 10:14:18] <+killuazhere> @rakijafav nah as a sombra main sombra still one shots zen and sym
[2022-12-24 10:14:19] <BakedZnake> hog is getting reworked shouldn't he be top top with that argument with brig.
[2022-12-24 10:14:26] <Afeatz> what do you think will make brigette playable again
[2022-12-24 10:14:40] <%Qnote> Brig is decent counter dive
[2022-12-24 10:14:45] <+killuazhere> @claymoreldr he has depression and doesn’t play the game for now
[2022-12-24 10:14:47] <%+cindycindyyyyy> how come genji is just in the middle?

[2022-12-24 10:15:01] <%deansmithereens> when did they say brig is getting reworked?
[2022-12-24 10:15:05] <%+izabelabl> yeah Fitzy doesnt play Sombra anymore since she just doesnt do anything
[2022-12-24 10:15:05] <username_needed> bladebot

[2022-12-24 10:15:13] <BakedZnake> that's what I meant shouldn't hog be top of the top because hog needs a rework

[2022-12-24 10:17:06] <%ElGatoMatador> i think thats a bit better i still think sym is very good on some maps

[2022-12-24 10:18:23] <+aj7continue> i think hog one step higher
[2022-12-24 10:18:29] <%Qnote> If rein had a 2k hp shield again would he still be bottom of barrel @iddqd
[2022-12-24 10:18:30] <%+IV_PREDATOR_VI> yeee was waiting for it
[2022-12-24 10:18:39] <username_needed> yeah that's better

[2022-12-24 10:19:03] <+SuperMannyPrime> why is junkrat over widow
[2022-12-24 10:19:17] <%va_firemedic> I think echo is slept on
[2022-12-24 10:19:19] <Springtrapsu> we are in ow2 not ow1 btw
[2022-12-24 10:19:21] <%Qnote> Soldier and echo are one and the same tbh
[2022-12-24 10:19:23] <%ElGatoMatador> hold m1 and get a shitton of damage and a 1 shot with mine
[2022-12-24 10:19:24] <%va_firemedic> And hands down the best dive dps in the game
[2022-12-24 10:19:25] <fatguy925> I feel mercy could be higher, siunce kiriko + mercy is played a lot too for focus healing smiteHmm
[2022-12-24 10:19:32] <%+cindycindyyyyy> not a lot of people can play echo well either
[2022-12-24 10:19:35] <%+cindycindyyyyy> junkrat is insane
[2022-12-24 10:19:38] <Variety8th> coz junk got buffed. his bombs r bigger than logs. theyre atmoic
[2022-12-24 10:19:38] <insacredflames> is this assuming that the characters are being played at their full potential or just in general?
[2022-12-24 10:19:42] <%ElGatoMatador> they both got better from lack of 2nd tank and no shields
[2022-12-24 10:19:46] <rankn1ne> Echo's hitbox is enormous
[2022-12-24 10:19:46] <+killuazhere> He is a rat
[2022-12-24 10:19:48] <%ElGatoMatador> like way better
[2022-12-24 10:19:49] <frockrl> ball can be op tho bottom?
[2022-12-24 10:19:53] <goblinsmoker> bastion though is pretty middlefolks imo
[2022-12-24 10:19:53] <%Qnote> @iddqd make a tier list for bronze players

[2022-12-24 10:21:03] <Eowii_> what makes you value soldier to be in the middle? doesnt he just does subpar damage with little dueling potential comapred to most other dps
[2022-12-24 10:21:04] <+SuperMannyPrime> @IV_PREDATOR_VI yeah i mean his ult is 10x better tbh

[2022-12-24 10:31:35] <%CRminus> they should remove the damage from the orb and make it slow only utility

[2022-12-24 11:27:04] <%backhandbob> they also reverted his knockback nerf with OW2, didn't they
[2022-12-24 11:27:06] <+thewywee> That is why they are implemented

[2022-12-24 11:27:32] <+thewywee> But I am sure there is a good design reason for not allocating space for a minimap in this game
[2022-12-24 11:27:37] <TacticalPew> does that jitter strafe do anything useful?

[2022-12-24 11:34:46] <+thewywee> @ft4cn1k the objective takes place in the main lane. There is no mistaking where the action is going to occur.  Yes, there are multiple rooms surrounding that main road. But, like I said, I think the ow devs assume that if you are new, you will play close to the main lane.

[2022-12-24 12:36:39] <%+AGirlCalledJim> LOL it means a direct hammer crit, not a hs

[2022-12-24 12:37:12] <%Pocketkos> Melee range shatter is a Hammer-down-hit "Headshot" on the first target, then the ground shatters forward.

[2022-12-24 12:37:39] <Grimstab77> If your in swing range target gets crit dmg. You know they buffed shatter to do one shot in melee range a long time ago? Now they added HS to shatter to show that

[2022-12-24 14:28:33] <%Sunnykeel> as a mercy, imo it's better to prioritize healing DPS over your tank since most other healers have to aim and have a much easier time healing the tank
