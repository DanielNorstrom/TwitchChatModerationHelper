[2022-12-28 07:53:39] <nbdtho> the more aggression becomes meta the more zone becomes easier. its a give and take thing. ulitmately the ratio should be decided by the point system and the skill level of the team

[2022-12-28 08:41:33] <%SSCDuvy> it depends on the mood im in haha, if i really wanna grind/ wanna play apex i dont care as much but at times i do end up just not playing and watch someone stream lmao @qtSwept

[2022-12-28 08:42:27] <murph4031> My biggest problem is being masters and looking for a squad and hardstuck D4’s are the only ones who want to run.
[2022-12-28 08:42:29] <joker24324343> i havent added new friends in awhile on apex because a lot of people just have an enormous ego

[2022-12-28 08:42:39] <+146ix> @qtSwept look for a squad in servers, like battlecord or the unofficial apex legends server (the official one you wont see any lfg posts below d3 for the most part)

[2022-12-28 08:51:39] <weibatail> Hi, Zach! Hope you are having a  delightful Christmas. I am always having unhappy experience while playing apex. I am always the guy who gets participant kills and assist kills no matter how hard or how fast i have been to catch up with my teammates. It just makes me like doing nothing in each match, and I felt so powerless about my luck. It seems I am not a lucky man to play this game
[2022-12-28 08:51:59] <qtSwept> @weibatail ...

[2022-12-28 08:53:45] <ZBowman> @weibatail It's not luck, it's skill. You need to learn to rotate faster, loot faster, keep up with your teammates. Even playing a non-movement character, I' can usually keep up with an octane. You just need to play more, practice more. peepoShrug

[2022-12-28 09:15:17] <murph4031> @richardxxi you already know. And on the scuf I feel like the stick tension is a tiny bit better than the pro. Since I play on linear that tiny difference is a game changer.

[2022-12-28 10:13:39] <%+Kelluur> is ranches on mnk?
[2022-12-28 10:13:49] <passion_fps> 150 is not that bad
[2022-12-28 10:14:16] <bighomiemagoo> Controller has higher floor, lower ceiling. Mnk is lower floor, higher ceiling
[2022-12-28 10:14:20] <+Dekharen> I think Roller requires a lot of game knowledge anyway. Positioning and awareness are key in Apex. It's just annoying to see people act as if roller doesn't have a huge issue with close range upper ceiling for sprays. It's something that's almost impossible to replicate on m&k
[2022-12-28 10:14:27] <passion_fps> oh i get it

[2022-12-28 10:16:21] <+Dekharen> I mean it's dumb but in a way it's tearing the pro scene. Apex already has super giga low viewership compared to games similar in size

[2022-12-28 10:50:11] <+Hazelnutsi> @chat is there no split in this season? why they are playing in this map still?
[2022-12-28 10:50:17] <+CookieDoughCutter> So is there a world where you and Alb get back together?
[2022-12-28 10:50:36] <%+SlayrSZN> good shit wishing fuhhnq and drew a merry christmas and not me. dont even care at all, that wouldnt have made me happy at all
[2022-12-28 10:50:38] <+Dekharen> One thing I hope is that "mazer moment" becomes gamer slang. Like, in 10 years kids would be saying having no idea who their lord and savior is LUL
[2022-12-28 10:50:43] <%TropicTv> damn that’s unfortunate your def right, they never got along I just thought that was normal for them. Didn’t think somthing was going on if that makes sense
[2022-12-28 10:50:44] <bannanable> will be interesting to see were mac ends up

[2022-12-28 10:58:44] <Spartangolf15> Honestly. Snipe has great game sense, but it’s kinda like a bad personality in a locker room. Things just don’t seem healthy whatever roster he’s on.

[2022-12-28 11:00:19] <Spartangolf15> Well I mean, alb and him didn’t get along obviously. But previous to that I felt like there was always tension

[2022-12-28 11:00:39] <bannanable> i think snipe had issue with some of macs calls where the stars had to align for it to work out but overall id say snipe is super positive as a teammate
[2022-12-28 11:00:54] <INOJi_yt> sounds like mac...

[2022-12-28 11:03:57] <%lunabenedict> hockey seems like such a cool sport, i wish it has a bigger presence where i live

[2022-12-28 11:07:57] <kobmadw2> Is apex better than warzone2? Are there controller players with fking AIM assist?
[2022-12-28 11:08:33] <+NothingButSchwag> @kobmadw2 could be a hot take but warzone just doesn’t feel smooth at all compared to apex
[2022-12-28 11:08:39] <+richardxxi> @kobmadw2 AA is worse in warzone, warzone is just worse in general
[2022-12-28 11:08:52] <+richardxxi> Warzone gets me so frustrated i quit after 2 games max
[2022-12-28 11:08:57] <bannanable> id say more people play warzone on controller then mnk

Its seems that its so much going on on apex, it will take few weeks to free the game, right? I have never played it but would like to try

[2022-12-28 11:17:05] <+DanImperialKitKat> But it's still bad enough people had to switch over
[2022-12-28 11:17:12] <+DanImperialKitKat> to AA
