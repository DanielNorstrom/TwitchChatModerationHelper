[2022-12-13 23:56:54] <%WhiteWolfe858> Cultural impact?
[2022-12-13 23:56:55] <%Omnijackk> i remember hanging out in the barnes and nobles at midnight waiting for the release with the rest of the crowd. fun times
[2022-12-13 23:56:57] <%BasedKaz> oh no that's totally understandable
[2022-12-13 23:56:57] <!legendofboomba> absolutely
[2022-12-13 23:56:59] <%WolfLord11> Harry Potter is definitely one of those

[2022-12-13 23:57:05] <%robinthebobbin99> I literally started reading Harry Potter, because my mom didn't have time one day to read it to me! vividLul I was THAT stubborn!
[2022-12-13 23:57:16] <JohnnyTightIips> Book good, author evil
[2022-12-13 23:57:18] <!M0YASI> i wish i got into harry potter before the author came out as an asshole
[2022-12-13 23:57:36] <%robinthebobbin99> Oh totally!
[2022-12-13 23:57:49] <!legendofboomba> i loved it as a kid, grew out of it as an adult, and turned off completely due to JKR's statements
[2022-12-13 23:57:57] <%WolfLord11> I own it
[2022-12-13 23:58:00] <%misterdonuto> did you vet your 4 guests to not be transphobic? i assume they won't be but ya know
[2022-12-13 23:58:02] <%itsbearVT> yeah a ton of people looked back and were like "hey maybe these other things in the book were kinda problematic too now that we know this"
[2022-12-13 23:58:03] <%robinthebobbin99> We all know the best way to experience Harry Potter now, is through the games!
[2022-12-13 23:58:05] <%Caleebie> Audio book version too!
[2022-12-13 23:58:06] <jozath12> bought one for 10$ kmaThink

[2022-12-13 23:58:12] <%GhostlyRazgrizX> Think about how quickly the entire Wizarding-World War III would have ended if all of the good guys had simply armed up with good ol' American hot lead.  Basilisk? Let's see how tough it is when you shoot it with a .470 Nitro Express. Worried about its Medusa-gaze? Wear night vision goggles. The image is light-amplified and re-transmitted to your eyes. You aren't looking at it--you're looking at a picture of it Cheer100
[2022-12-13 23:58:13] <theneatestburrito> Pirating these books is praxis at this point.
[2022-12-13 23:58:14] <%misterdonuto> i mean books are free to read if you have a library card
[2022-12-13 23:58:20] <%Omnijackk> having fun isn't hard when you've got a library card!
[2022-12-13 23:58:20] <%BasedKaz> I think I still have my old copy. I'd love to reread it again erosNodders
[2022-12-13 23:58:26] <%+MelkorTheGreat> Nice dodge vividCool
[2022-12-13 23:58:37] <machacha_fulgrim> do you think vrchat should have a library?
[2022-12-13 23:58:38] <%EpicMagikarp> libraries these days have ebooks
[2022-12-13 23:58:52] <LordAziki> The scent of paper is nostalgic, but physical books are obsolete.

[2022-12-13 23:59:13] <%misterdonuto> the libraries in my state have all banded togetehr and created a digital cert you pick up with amazon to rent/borrow books from kindle so long as they're through the local library. it's weird. i do it for study guides
[2022-12-13 23:59:23] <%$FuyuSketch> if you critique it while you read would that count as transformative?
[2022-12-13 23:59:26] <%BasedKaz> yeah you'd only be able to read public domain titles
[2022-12-13 23:59:33] <%Dragonator_g> Theoretically you can read passages for the purpose of tearing them apart.
[2022-12-13 23:59:36] <%Omnijackk> there's an app called hoopla over here that connects you to your library's ebook library. they also got comics and stuff
[2022-12-13 23:59:46] <%captainshotgun> Yup even with comics you can't show text.
[2022-12-13 23:59:50] <%WhiteWolfe858> @ghostlyrazgrizx yer any fantasy gets rocked against modern armys
