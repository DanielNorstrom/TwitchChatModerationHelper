[2022-12-17 14:07:28] <%+kewickviper> you got gas bills to pay dude
[2022-12-17 14:07:29] <%+HemmingJensen> It would also give you more chances to take breaks or just to stand up and relax a bit
[2022-12-17 14:07:33] <%CptCrunch_> Dude, most people have working adblockers anyways. And its 3 minutes that people can use to get snacks/go to the bathroom if you wait for those 3 minutes and don't do boss fights @dinossindgeil
[2022-12-17 14:07:48] <%Mellon_> me
[2022-12-17 14:07:51] <%+kewickviper> yes
[2022-12-17 14:07:53] <%Mellon_> yeah its fine
[2022-12-17 14:08:05] <Gargawang> AdBlock go brrr
[2022-12-17 14:08:08] <%Alvard_Greyheart> I thought we are here for ads.
[2022-12-17 14:08:09] <%Mumpi> You are triggering the ads manually, thats totally fine. For me just the automated ads are really annoying
[2022-12-17 14:08:10] <kingketa4395> then wait on it
[2022-12-17 14:08:13] <+Alessandro_B_88> Helloooooo Nicoooooo 👋🏽👋🏽👋🏽👋🏽👋🏽👋🏽
[2022-12-17 14:08:21] <%+kewickviper> yeah it doesn't work that well
[2022-12-17 14:08:26] <%+prisonerbae> It’s hard to operate based off of what ifs and fear. You have no evidence to work with to discern consequences besides that ain said it works for him
[2022-12-17 14:08:27] <%TheSwedishPlantie> I think you should do it, get that bag. I was under the impression that the 1 minute incentive already got rid of pre-rolls. If it doesn't but the 3 minute one does, then the 3 minute one is better.
[2022-12-17 14:08:27] <%+jimbowizbo> wait this isn't an ad?
[2022-12-17 14:08:31] <%EldritchHunt> it sucks but that's what twitch does. any channel i'm not subbed to i get ads immediately when i go there
[2022-12-17 14:08:44] <%+kewickviper> stream growth is good tho, more money in the long term
[2022-12-17 14:08:46] <%imnotsml> prerolls are much worse imo
[2022-12-17 14:08:47] <Mister_Leisure> just for reference, ads never show up on Chromecast
[2022-12-17 14:08:49] <%CptCrunch_> I have one that usually works. Its been turning streams into powerpoint presentations during ads lately however.
[2022-12-17 14:08:50] <%+Hellomahmilkman> It works fine but lags stream rly bad during ads
[2022-12-17 14:08:55] <%Supergegor> Do you still benefit from the adds if we use an addblock?
[2022-12-17 14:08:56] <+AndyDale93> No one likes ads but since I have 2 monitors I don't mind so much. As long as I can support you by sticking around that's all that matters to me.
[2022-12-17 14:09:09] <%+kewickviper> if you can get rid of pre-rolls then definitely do that, nothing puts me off new streams more than pre-rolls
[2022-12-17 14:09:21] <xsElementality> I think in general mid-rolls are better than pre-rolls
[2022-12-17 14:09:21] <%CptCrunch_> Andy, thats the spirit NODDERS
[2022-12-17 14:09:29] <%+kewickviper> if a new stream has a pre-roll 99% of the time I'm clicking off and never watching them again
[2022-12-17 14:09:34] <%Mellon_> id at least try it , see what happens and go from there, the worst channel growth slows for a month on the other hand Twitch may recommend your channel more because longer ad exposure?
[2022-12-17 14:09:43] <%+camf3> NOTED
[2022-12-17 14:09:50] <Mister_Leisure> Good morning! And yes, we've been watching Twitch on Chromecast for years and have never gotten a single ad
[2022-12-17 14:09:55] <shakyyhandd> Nico <3
[2022-12-17 14:09:55] <%joliru> hey Nico hey chat
[2022-12-17 14:09:57] <kingketa4395> doesnt lag for me
[2022-12-17 14:10:03] <%+kewickviper> doesn't lag for me either
[2022-12-17 14:10:05] <%Witzkatz> @kewickviper Yup, agreed, prerolls are the biggest turnoffs
[2022-12-17 14:10:05] <Arkosios_> Yep. Chromecast has built in ad blocker
[2022-12-17 14:10:11] <%+prisonerbae> Yeah I’m saying you should listen to ain and not your fears
[2022-12-17 14:10:13] <%CptCrunch_> @dinossindgeil Some adblocks that DO work make stream lag sometimes when there is ads being played
[2022-12-17 14:10:14] <%Naruto11k> imo i'd say if your goal is to increase viewership, ads will just be a huge obstacle Hmmm but it's your call
[2022-12-17 14:10:19] <%JustInTime525> I think that it is normal to expect ads when watching a channel you aren't sub to now days. Its not a surprise to see / expect ads.
[2022-12-17 14:10:28] <Arkosios_> I NEVER get ads while watching through Chromecast
[2022-12-17 14:10:38] <kingketa4395> honestly, i think you're right about the 3 minute ad block @dinossindgeil
[2022-12-17 14:10:47] <%Maxax12346> heya people
[2022-12-17 14:10:49] <+tarentina> Hi Nicoooooo 👋🏻👋🏻👋🏻
[2022-12-17 14:10:56] <+AndyDale93> Yeah I agree it's such a hard thing to find a balance.
[2022-12-17 14:11:03] <shakyyhandd> yeaaaaaaaa brother OMEGALUL
[2022-12-17 14:11:05] <%+kewickviper> growth is always good
[2022-12-17 14:11:06] <shakyyhandd> it was epic
[2022-12-17 14:11:10] <%CptCrunch_> @Naruto11k mid-rolls to prevent pre-rolls would help a lot tho. Most people just click off streams when there is pre-rolls and usually don't come back Shruge
[2022-12-17 14:11:12] <cioree84> this Is very kind of you. coz there are people cannot spend Money for It even if they would like to
[2022-12-17 14:11:39] <%Naruto11k> @CptCrunch_ true, that's a huge turn-off Hmmm
[2022-12-17 14:11:44] <%+seijuro13> hello daggerman
[2022-12-17 14:12:05] <shakyyhandd> @dinossindgeil it was Uni exam season as well
[2022-12-17 14:12:10] <%+kewickviper> its tough making a living on twitch because you often don't know the reason for viewership drop and gain
[2022-12-17 14:12:11] <%+marzapower> hola people
[2022-12-17 14:12:13] <kingketa4395> thats pretty decent money tbh
[2022-12-17 14:12:18] <%+marzapower> have a good saturday!
[2022-12-17 14:12:19] <%joliru> take it man 99% of your chat would in your position
[2022-12-17 14:12:22] <+regularproblem> Heya Nico GL with the runs today
[2022-12-17 14:12:25] <%Nawarone> the problem is you can't make that conclusions just based on viewers. You cannot seperate the factors influenting your viewer counts.
[2022-12-17 14:12:27] <%ShamanDOGMAi> \o/
[2022-12-17 14:12:31] <%+kewickviper> some people just have other stuff going on and stop watching, also I think everyone got a big bump in the pandemic
[2022-12-17 14:12:37] <%bienens_> oooor maybe twitch algo helps you more when you play more ads?
[2022-12-17 14:12:38] <%+camf3> Yeah it makes a lot of sense, I definitely get it <3
[2022-12-17 14:12:49] <%Mellon_> In this day and age, grab the money dude, stop trying to please everyone and be selfish for once dinossLove
[2022-12-17 14:13:05] <+regularproblem> Did you see the news about Rich Campbell of OTK getting accused of SA?
[2022-12-17 14:13:07] <feels_like_dev> morning machinoHi
[2022-12-17 14:13:10] <Greywolfe198> can you ask your twitch rep about that?
[2022-12-17 14:13:17] <%MegatonLink> You know, I just had a personal review that has feedback applicable to your situation. "Everyone is doing it, just don't be so open about it" other streamers do it and don't talk about how often it is. It happens like automatically (the ad breaks) and they just keep playing in background.
[2022-12-17 14:13:27] <%CptCrunch_> Personally, I sometimes don't bother checking out streams if they have pre-rolls unless its part of a community like the no-hit community. Don't wanna end up "wasting" my time just to find out that I don't wanna stick around the stream spooks6LOL
[2022-12-17 14:13:41] <shakyyhandd> exactly.. november and early december is exam season at schools and Unis soo maybe less viewers because of that too
[2022-12-17 14:13:48] <%Supergegor> can't you check with Twitch in advance if you can fall back on the 1 minute option?
[2022-12-17 14:13:58] <%MegatonLink> Your people, us simps in chat who are dedicated to the channel, appreciate it. I don't think it's a deal breaker, you know?
[2022-12-17 14:14:03] <+regularproblem> Damn i missed it. Alright.

[2022-12-17 14:37:40] <JohnVeloc> Open World is good and bad in any game.  When it comes to bosses - If you have 165 bosses, they will not be all unique and best bosses in souls.
[2022-12-17 14:37:40] <%happyverii> or do as in sweden where you lose everything if caught doing drugs instead of getting help. It's a fantastic system that wins us the #1 spot in europe in mortality rate:D

[2022-12-17 14:41:56] <taftusimus> one thing I came to dislike, or rather feel disappointed with, about ER was the lack of offence in the game. You have all those amazing options to play with but again the game forces you to be defensive against bosses. Only Bloodborne had that feeling of strong possible offense

[2022-12-17 14:45:11] <%meinMestar> taftusimus i mean i felt like that on my first playthrough but after learning the fights better there aren't many boss attacks that completely block you from getting hits in ainnHmm
[2022-12-17 14:45:11] <%notyetadog> bloodborne run is done? i vaguely remeber you said gonna do one after GR3
[2022-12-17 14:45:13] <JiL000> I think being a policeman can be very cool.. besides the presure, it can be a fun job if you like not having a routine.. I mean if you like having surprises and adrenaline everyday
[2022-12-17 14:45:41] <%+prisonerbae> @meinmestar yeah I do think Paul would’ve liked ER if he played more after form’s balance changes. He plays with colossal/greatswords and they were in ruff shape initially

[2022-12-17 14:50:59] <%Jammy20466> We have a bill for UBI in Wales to start
[2022-12-17 14:51:07] <taftusimus> UBI would prevent so many fucking predatory companies abusing people

[2022-12-17 14:51:34] <+MaritimeRetro> taxes pay for society
[2022-12-17 14:51:37] <@%+Lakerr_> spol CatAHomie
[2022-12-17 14:51:38] <%+kewickviper> yeah but that income comes from peoples taxes right
[2022-12-17 14:51:40] <%Nexaron_dragonbite> @dinossindgeil i agree!! i have absolutly no idea what to do with my life and go to work coz i have to, i am not greedy, with ubi i could live in moderation or look for work i enjoy
[2022-12-17 14:51:42] <+MaritimeRetro> thats how taxes work
[2022-12-17 14:51:52] <%+kewickviper> so everyone pays for UBI
[2022-12-17 14:51:55] <%+Kittyhavoc> @TheMadMoxxie do you have any idea how much of your productivity is withheld through wage theft
[2022-12-17 14:52:13] <%thirtyfiver> The top 1% will do everything they can to not let that happen
[2022-12-17 14:52:17] <+MaritimeRetro> heres a fun one, corporations have tricked you into thinking taxes are somethign the government just takes from you and spends on coke or something. it doesn't. it pays for the roads, schools, every aspect of society
[2022-12-17 14:52:21] <%+kewickviper> it's a very soft form of income equality
[2022-12-17 14:52:29] <%TheMadMoxxie> @kittyhavoc you underestimate how much I'm paid
[2022-12-17 14:52:35] <%+slimgoodie> @dinossindgeil doing well. thanks
[2022-12-17 14:52:36] <%+kewickviper> yeah I agree
[2022-12-17 14:52:46] <+MaritimeRetro> have you noticed how all of your roads are shit? your schools are shit? society is shit? thats because nobody is taxing corporatoins anymore
[2022-12-17 14:52:51] <%TheMadMoxxie> no not a millionaire
[2022-12-17 14:53:01] <%TheMadMoxxie> but not struggling
[2022-12-17 14:53:22] <%TheMadMoxxie> I agree to that
[2022-12-17 14:53:22] <%Jammy20466> UBI is to cover basic needs
[2022-12-17 14:53:33] <%camf3> That makes sense, I agree with that cuteNODDERS
[2022-12-17 14:53:40] <%+moosemaster17> dinossComfy
[2022-12-17 14:53:54] <+Naynachi> this sounds utopic
[2022-12-17 14:53:55] <%+Kittyhavoc> problem with UBI is thatyou have to freeze rent, then more and more stuff, because they WILL take the extra money you get away from you
[2022-12-17 14:54:01] <%+prisonerbae> Money is distributed through taxes from labor but when labor is automated and there is surplus of labor and profit that can be used to bettering society and grating social securities —This is the point of economic advancement.

[2022-12-17 14:54:13] <%jerzy_hedgehog> gg
[2022-12-17 14:54:14] <%notyetadog> plus with automation a lot of jobs bsically will not exist anyomre, those people have to live some way
[2022-12-17 14:54:34] <%happyverii> and society will be so much better if people don't have to struggle to have basic things to live and advance with whatever
[2022-12-17 14:54:35] <%thirtyfiver> I’m with you Dino, but at least in the US, the greed is so great it will always be heavily opposed. Even people who would benefit are brainwashed to hate it
[2022-12-17 14:54:36] <%+kewickviper> yeah job automation means UBI is inevitable
[2022-12-17 14:54:41] <%TheMadMoxxie> @kittyhavoc we do profit sharing at our company and anything over 40 hours a week is automatically double time ...
[2022-12-17 14:54:47] <+MaritimeRetro> ubi is definitely inevitable I dont deny this
[2022-12-17 14:55:04] <%TheMadMoxxie> our company treats us very well
[2022-12-17 14:55:10] <%+Kittyhavoc> There was a german guy who predicted everything Kappa
[2022-12-17 14:55:12] <+MaritimeRetro> i feel like ubi will replace the pension program eventually
[2022-12-17 14:55:16] <%+Kittyhavoc> A couple of german guys in fact
[2022-12-17 14:55:18] <%+Kittyhavoc> And a bald russian
[2022-12-17 14:55:21] <%+kewickviper> @TheMadMoxxie, What is your profession if you don't mind sharing?
[2022-12-17 14:55:25] <%+moosemaster17> Not every company is like this moxie
[2022-12-17 14:55:28] <+MaritimeRetro> because pension programs are bound to fail tbh
[2022-12-17 14:55:41] <%camf3> I wish I wasn't so tired cause I'd add to this discussion Sadge
[2022-12-17 14:55:45] <%Jammy20466> pension programs in the UK are unsustainable and UBI needs to be a replacement
[2022-12-17 14:55:53] <%TheMadMoxxie> @kewickviper I am a finisher

[2022-12-17 16:27:25] <%aredmongoose> Technically, you could still get a dmca claim. But, the software that automates that process checks vod recordings. So, someone who works for the company that owns the copyright for the song would have to make the claim while you're live.

[2022-12-17 17:27:17] <%TheDoctor1208> @dinossindgeil there are a few parry ashes of war. The magic one is better than golden parry because it has the same frames, is easier to get, and doesn't use FP unless you're parrying spells.
