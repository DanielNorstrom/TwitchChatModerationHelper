[2022-12-11 14:44:16] <+nycune> Koreans are in general very good at english, mostly due to the great education system over there
[2022-12-11 14:44:27] <%cjx00> today also rain alot 😂😂 cold weather for Malaysia

[2022-12-11 14:46:01] <%iamthebadside> interesting
[2022-12-11 14:46:16] <%cjx00> language you have to speak and write to be proficient
[2022-12-11 14:46:20] <Mazzeri> Asian education is very textbook memory focused
[2022-12-11 14:46:21] <%miketwng> I believe that overall Korean writes amazing English but not practical on speaking
[2022-12-11 14:46:25] <%IZTheOne> they study business/written English.
[2022-12-11 14:46:29] <+nycune> Never been to Korea (it's my next trip) but met a lot of koreans here in New York and work with them on a daily basis so that might have given me a biased view ...
[2022-12-11 14:47:15] <%miketwng> Ok it's all academic rote learning
[2022-12-11 14:47:25] <%iamthebadside> Koreans don't travel fat from Korea

[2022-12-11 15:18:01] <@%Casedy> they cant choose who they pick up so sometimes they purposely do that so they dont have to travel for or get stuck in the traffic
