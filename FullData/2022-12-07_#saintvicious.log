[2022-12-07 17:42:35] <%+TitusGroen> "love the stream. get me out of here"
[2022-12-07 17:42:38] <sfscintyvp> fiddle stuck or?
[2022-12-07 17:42:47] <+bobbedies> i like how anima squad was "a little strong" according to mort so they nerfed the trait on every stage and half its champs + their correspondent traits :D gg best comp, see ya next patch i guess
[2022-12-07 17:44:19] <%FooBarBazQuux> Fiddle had 375ap
[2022-12-07 17:44:20] <%FooBarBazQuux> lol

[2022-12-07 17:44:35] <%FooBarBazQuux> yah
[2022-12-07 17:44:49] <vrasp> cris probably playing lost ark instead of duoing with the boys Sadge
[2022-12-07 17:45:13] <+bobbedies> yeah they made him get more ap from the souls he collects and nerfed his dmg ... and then they just straight buffed his dmg again at release without nerfing the soul gain, so backline fiddle is indeed strong i guess
[2022-12-07 17:45:29] <%FooBarBazQuux> Top 2?
[2022-12-07 17:45:41] <6dot_> it wouldnt be that strong without janna
