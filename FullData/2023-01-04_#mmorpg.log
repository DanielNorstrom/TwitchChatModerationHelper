[2023-01-04 12:35:37] <%60itemgold> maybe they each drop an important item you need to combine, making you need to kill each
[2023-01-04 12:35:40] <%Adrenzy> maybe they drop a piece of an item each
[2023-01-04 12:35:41] <R0yalDutchman> goodmorning bro
[2023-01-04 12:35:45] <%Adrenzy> yea
[2023-01-04 12:35:50] <R0yalDutchman> update about the sneak : they send me a new shaker straight away
[2023-01-04 12:35:52] <qelnn> hopefully each one drops a piece of somethign
[2023-01-04 12:35:56] <Dreadchain> I mean it's a grandmaster quest with a new prayer book, that's already pretty huge
[2023-01-04 12:35:58] <%Adrenzy> 60itemgold same thought hello
[2023-01-04 12:36:00] <%reelaps> howdy curtis! how we doing today? khanze1Kree
[2023-01-04 12:36:03] <%Adrenzy> pog
[2023-01-04 12:36:06] <@%This_Land> Yeah a different 1/*k drop that either makes one single item or is part of a set would be cool
[2023-01-04 12:36:18] <andthekey> given that they said toa finale would be a duo boss fight i dont thingk the 4 bosses will be that much different x0r6ztGiggle

[2023-01-04 12:37:08] <rasmusbjeppesen> progression in the bosses could be nice aswell, so you would have to get something from 1st to make 2nd possible and so forth
[2023-01-04 12:37:12] <@%SaekeaS> yo some1 lemme know if rob comes online
[2023-01-04 12:37:16] <+Diammmond> maybe each boss will drop a prayer scroll for the book
[2023-01-04 12:37:20] <Gorsol1> gauntlet and zalcano for sote
[2023-01-04 12:37:30] <@%This_Land> Seeing as DT is a 'magic' focused questline (sort of) it could be 4 pieces of a ring that will actually make the ring slot relevant for magic because Seers (i) is pretty garbo
[2023-01-04 12:38:31] <@%GuidoMista96> @This_Land i thought dt2 they were gonna give virtuous robes from the pvm content?
[2023-01-04 12:38:37] <%+Gnarwolfy> Good luck on the drops today man mmorpgNice
[2023-01-04 12:38:37] <TwoPointPerspective> Grandmasters are also obsessed with putting the number 2 after the name of a famous quest
[2023-01-04 12:38:38] <@%This_Land> yeah dmg % init

[2023-01-04 12:39:01] <enrriqueortega> good morning friend
[2023-01-04 12:39:12] <@%This_Land> GuidoMista96 you're probably right bro! I just meant giving us a magic ring with dmg % rather than flat stats for accuracy!
[2023-01-04 12:39:15] <Wise_Deku> @Mmorpg you were doing 400 or higher for toa during your grind?
[2023-01-04 12:39:20] <Ice_Cloud> How does guessing what the boss can drop in OS work? Doesn't anything more than the common drop table have to be polled?
[2023-01-04 12:39:30] <Ice_Cloud> I don't play enough OS to know
