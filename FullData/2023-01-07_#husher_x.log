[2023-01-07 08:17:06] <@%AslanGrants> I never got to play galaxy or 64
[2023-01-07 08:17:08] <SimplyFam1> i played mario clone on pc, in 06, super fun
[2023-01-07 08:17:16] <@%$Kris18_TF2> @skuddyindies husher1Wave Welcome on in~!
[2023-01-07 08:17:16] <@%zeaket> only 3d marios i played were 64 and sunshine
[2023-01-07 08:17:24] <@%zeaket> tbh was never super big into mario
[2023-01-07 08:17:33] <@%$Kris18_TF2> @AslanGrants IMO Galaxy is overrated. 64 is great but controls are a bit clunky by modern standards, even if really damn good at the time
[2023-01-07 08:17:49] <SimplyFam1> odyssey?
[2023-01-07 08:17:52] <@%AslanGrants> One day I'll get my Wii emulator working
[2023-01-07 08:17:56] <@%AslanGrants> I did not like Odyssey

[2023-01-07 08:18:08] <@%+PrimeNakels> oooh nice
[2023-01-07 08:18:21] VIEWERS: 62
[2023-01-07 08:18:23] <@%AslanGrants> it controls and plays great but I do not like the action constantly being interrupted by super super easy challenges or just free prizes
[2023-01-07 08:18:39] <@%$Kris18_TF2> @AslanGrants Odyssey is a great game, but sometimes being too grand can put off some players or make them lose interest. That kind happened to me after a few worlds.

[2023-01-07 09:00:30] <@%$Kris18_TF2> soft-lock means the game is playing, but can't progress.

[2023-01-07 09:01:59] <@%$Kris18_TF2> @itMeDin to be fair, ghostbusters are both super competent and super incompetent.
