[2023-01-02 10:06:16] <ahreniais> any tips for a dps player to grind ladder ? i'm plat and it seems like if i get the better tank i win / enemy tank is better i lose
[2023-01-02 10:06:16] <xTaxedx> That new tank when he ults and nano he just wiped an entire team
[2023-01-02 10:06:22] <+quarkons> at your level is it rude to ask your tank to switch
[2023-01-02 10:06:28] <xTaxedx> Yeah, I’m only plat.. so I dunno a lot
[2023-01-02 10:06:35] <Ag3L3s> Oh no People don’t understand Dive still
[2023-01-02 10:06:47] <Ahshton> @xTaxedx sorry i meant when u said winston cant kill orisa
[2023-01-02 10:07:01] <Ahshton> u dont focus another tank as a dive tank
[2023-01-02 10:07:01] <xTaxedx> Winston can’t kill orisa kraggie even said
[2023-01-02 10:07:24] <xTaxedx> You can if you play hog
[2023-01-02 10:07:26] <xTaxedx> Or Zarya
[2023-01-02 10:07:32] <vIM4KER> teammates shoudlve given u sourjon for ez win
[2023-01-02 10:07:37] <%ketaruz> orisa vs orisa is so silly COGGERS CCOGGERS

[2023-01-02 10:07:58] <ipovx> u think tank in ow2 needs to make space for team?
[2023-01-02 10:08:13] <xTaxedx> Why doesn’t kraggie play sorjourn
[2023-01-02 10:08:14] <+typischandy87> @kragiee happy New year
[2023-01-02 10:08:24] <opti_omgthisana> So true
[2023-01-02 10:08:31] <%ketaruz> happy new year all kragie7
[2023-01-02 10:08:32] <IceTw_> You think they should add 1 more tank, and nerf them all?
[2023-01-02 10:08:33] <dorev_> And people still don't want to admit tanks are busted
[2023-01-02 10:08:44] <xTaxedx> So why did they make tanks so overpowered in  ow2?
[2023-01-02 10:08:54] <ahreniais> @kragiee how do you carry with a bad tank as a dps below diam ?
[2023-01-02 10:08:57] <xTaxedx> I prefer ow1 tbh
[2023-01-02 10:08:59] <Ahshton> is it true hog is getting nerf to 1 shot ? if so thats so lame
[2023-01-02 10:09:06] <Ahshton> thats the only thing he can do
[2023-01-02 10:09:14] <%sm1leFTW> @xTaxedx i think hes just bored of her.. being meta for too loong
[2023-01-02 10:09:19] <opti_omgthisana> The game is not balanced at all 😅
[2023-01-02 10:09:45] <opti_omgthisana> But it’s hard for devs to make it balanced

[2023-01-02 10:09:54] <xTaxedx> I’ve played ow since day 1 and I’m not super skilled but I’ve always liked the game but I’m pretty realistic, I think ow2 didn’t do much for it.
[2023-01-02 10:10:07] <ninelie08> hows your new year ragie
[2023-01-02 10:10:08] <%ketaruz> NOOO
[2023-01-02 10:10:18] <ipovx> same scenario as OW1  realse the game with busted things try to balance and fail realse new op heroes
[2023-01-02 10:10:46] <Awesome356> any patch notes coming soon?
[2023-01-02 10:10:53] <ahreniais> kind of incredible that in every pvp games like ow or lol, the devs just give them a ton of damage + tankiness + cc, how no one is learning thats its shit
[2023-01-02 10:10:58] <xTaxedx> So ow2 is as dead as ow1 already?
[2023-01-02 10:11:00] <Ag3L3s> I don’t think it’s hard to lower numbers
[2023-01-02 10:11:10] <opti_omgthisana> If you nerf a heroe, another one is becoming meta , it’s a long chain
[2023-01-02 10:11:26] <%ketaruz> nice analogy Okayeg
[2023-01-02 10:11:27] <ipovx> @xTaxedx dead? idont think but unbalanced
[2023-01-02 10:11:35] <%sm1leFTW> but its not just the issue for blizzard tho.. all comp games are fucked with balance issues.
[2023-01-02 10:11:42] <opti_omgthisana> Yea yea

[2023-01-02 10:11:56] <vIM4KER> why whats unbalanced other than hog?
[2023-01-02 10:12:13] <fatracooncat> that actually explains it pretty well, how silly it actually is
[2023-01-02 10:12:19] <xTaxedx> I mean this game doesn’t even have a competitive rank system
[2023-01-02 10:12:34] <xTaxedx> I mean shit you don’t know if your rank is going up or down
[2023-01-02 10:12:36] <mintypkr> imo pretty damn hard to balance casual player base with top competitive base

[2023-01-02 10:16:44] <%ketaruz> it pierces shields now so it can secure kills on weakened targets
[2023-01-02 10:16:50] <xTaxedx> Because you can direct the dva bomb

[2023-01-02 10:20:36] <xTaxedx> It’s definitely pay to win. Kiriko sorjourn and the new tank on the same team will 100% win
[2023-01-02 10:20:43] <lanotazyon> OH
[2023-01-02 10:20:47] <fasc_> YESIDOTHINKSO it is
[2023-01-02 10:20:55] <%ketaruz> ram is kinda tricky to use
[2023-01-02 10:21:00] <+theemagician> which Ult is the most OP in the game in ur opinion
[2023-01-02 10:21:08] <0dddshot> @xTaxedx its only p2w if they are locked behind a paywall. you can unlock them for free aint pay to win
[2023-01-02 10:21:10] <%ketaruz> he's both poke and close range

[2023-01-02 10:22:14] <Ag3L3s> It pauses the timer

[2023-01-02 10:23:36] <xTaxedx> Does his ultimate use his health?
[2023-01-02 10:23:45] <jackdunne45> Imo kiriko is unhealthy for the game if a character has to be picked every game over every other character in that role it's not good for the game
