[2023-01-09 23:58:01] <@%^Nightbot> What thy ribbons hath thou spoke about myself, you petite pig-cutter? I shall allow you the knowledge that I hath graduated with honors from a college of marksmanship, and have partaken in many a raid upon the compounds of rabid delinquents. I hath received training in thy courses of stealth and infiltration; My practices and studies of the musket hath rendered me a skilled marksman.
