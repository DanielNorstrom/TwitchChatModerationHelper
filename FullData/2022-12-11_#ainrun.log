[2022-12-11 09:50:18] <%AlaskanBeard> Armored Core has been a series since 1997, I don't think From cares if there's an overlap in fanbase or not.
[2022-12-11 09:50:28] <!%dawnberri> i'm gonna assume respawning enemies and boss arenas are gonna be the 'souls like' elements
[2022-12-11 09:50:28] <heretic_acolyte> miyazaki should make a horror game
[2022-12-11 09:50:37] <+yuki7000> you should try some of the old games, they are good
[2022-12-11 09:50:39] <%MadKingHyperion> did you grab the icon shield?
[2022-12-11 09:50:49] <%Android_Saya> from what I've seen of the old Armored Core, its not really for me
[2022-12-11 09:51:08] <%dairagas> Imagine the only soulslike element they bring into armored core VI is...a fucking poison swamp

[2022-12-11 13:56:46] <FelidaeSocialis> What I wonder is if you can build up status effect with kick Hmm

[2022-12-11 14:41:35] <FelidaeSocialis> @ZombyWo0f Don't reroll, but do you have longer weapon? That may help. If not play very slowly and only hit when you are very sure that you won't get countered. Few AoW are pretty good, like Lion's claw, Blood Slash, chilling mist, etc. Freeze pot can help too.
