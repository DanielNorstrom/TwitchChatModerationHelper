[2022-12-20 12:00:42] <%Dragonator_g> Star Wars was incredible for its time, but by the time I watched it everything it pioneered was already mainstream and improved by others, so I didn't like the original.
[2022-12-20 12:00:49] <angelframe> Why can't more couples just talk about minecraft or digging holes with your hand?

[2022-12-20 13:24:45] <Treiclon> nightmare before christmas is certainly a videogame too
[2022-12-20 13:24:46] <NoahLink3> I think it was unanimously agreed that the E.T. game was unplayable, and many copies buried in the desert

[2022-12-20 13:26:02] <%SpitfireGunner> @n8_crafter You take that back the home of the TTS
[2022-12-20 13:26:08] <+woodbogus> It‚Äôs a flash game you pay for
[2022-12-20 13:26:15] <gorillafinn> any bees in chat?
[2022-12-20 13:26:17] <%CorneredBadger13> im not awake enough for this. I did not hear Peggle, and was very confused how we had gotten to this topic
[2022-12-20 13:26:18] <%Poqksi> Big Rigs: Over the Road Racing is pretty much up there as the worst PC game.

[2022-12-20 13:26:28] <%n8_crafter> @n8_crafter yes, the TTS is the only reason to play it the actual gameplay sucks
[2022-12-20 13:26:37] <NoahLink3> Ever tried peglin? It‚Äôs basically rouge-like Peggle

[2022-12-20 13:27:56] <%SpitfireGunner> Ride to Hell Retribution is a game that was on console and PC It is genuinely Soulless game that was moral and computationally bankrupt that one is a dumpster fire that I wish I could wipe from memory of everyone who interacted with it
