[2022-12-24 05:49:24] <+jundo999> I did Nighmare Raid today and its so annoying to do. I'd be ok with it if there is a teleporter
[2022-12-24 05:49:24] <+KrysisKrow> i dont  mind it, but having to pay millions in gold to switch gear to those characters REALLY sucks
[2022-12-24 05:49:29] <obsoleteshn> I can only beat the queen on nightmare Sadge
[2022-12-24 05:49:31] <%+WildNeptune> i dont thinkthe fights are that hard. its more you need to use 20 different units for it
[2022-12-24 05:49:43] <Taffyions> feels like a chore to do
[2022-12-24 05:49:50] <Fergala> at least you get to see units youd otherwise never use

[2022-12-24 05:50:07] <%ChargingStream> vera, juvelee and queen are the ones I hate
[2022-12-24 05:50:10] <ThirteenLantern> Vera is the hardest YEP
[2022-12-24 05:50:16] <obsoleteshn> Queen is actually the easiest
[2022-12-24 05:50:28] <%AuKi39> how hard a boss is depends on the units you have
[2022-12-24 05:50:28] <Xamess> vera is the worst by far ok
[2022-12-24 05:50:28] <%+WildNeptune> queen is easy because everyone uses their best units for it
[2022-12-24 05:50:32] <lockjaw_live> theyre all needlessly rng

[2022-12-24 07:03:52] <%ChargingStream> It feels like SG can't do anything proper, they always have to put some restriction
[2022-12-24 07:03:52] <%tetorodotoki> they can sell pack from it i think ?
[2022-12-24 07:03:57] <Sly_cooper_18> do you think they'll add more slots to grace?

[2022-12-24 08:46:42] <MoonS1ar> @Jenazad there is an argument to be made in picking arby early game but not complete it then when your mid game change your  pick to stene
[2022-12-24 08:46:44] <xevv___> stene is queen
[2022-12-24 08:46:44] <%+KildTheBuild> Arby vs Spectre was a lot closer when it first came out but Arby fell off a cliff meta wise

[2022-12-24 08:48:59] <%+Leifal> or do like me, start w arby and then reset it for stene?
[2022-12-24 08:48:59] <hamood194> I picked Arby after pulling stene and STILL regret picking him
[2022-12-24 08:49:00] <ashleythetwin> i picked arby but i got stene from covenant summons Clueless
[2022-12-24 08:49:01] <%noresindansgame> arby is just for faster farming in pve but stene is more useful later
[2022-12-24 08:49:04] <%theploxer> She needs balance correction BBRAT
[2022-12-24 08:49:10] <%ayasimpka> i rather build 3 stene than having an arby

[2022-12-24 08:49:19] <%nocting> She'd be a force ban
[2022-12-24 08:49:22] <%ZessZZ> i think her worst state in the future will still be better than most
[2022-12-24 08:49:22] <frostfirefox_> i knew stene was better but chose arby anyway BASED
[2022-12-24 08:49:24] <Fergala> i remember when i say a video saying krau will always be balanced Aware
[2022-12-24 08:49:24] <%3lokikey> I got judge K still mad to this day
[2022-12-24 08:49:24] <%Douma1302> @Jenazad there's a reason why someone on twitch created an account name "tenebae" yumyum
[2022-12-24 08:49:29] <%Lucysbrother> for faster farm can just use free spirit tieria or vildred
[2022-12-24 08:49:29] <%Luckyseven500> NOTED ok feet OP
[2022-12-24 08:49:30] <%HexWan> arby is only good for first 2 episodes even, later on she does more dmg
[2022-12-24 08:49:31] <+rofltank64> Arby was a legit option before the penguin rework, now you can farm with whoever you want
[2022-12-24 08:49:34] <tom2waii> now its S tene Salesman

[2022-12-24 12:33:12] <Biako11> before the remastered version getting to a bonefire in demon souls was like doing a marathon
[2022-12-24 12:33:18] <Biako11> they added way too much in demon souls
[2022-12-24 12:33:23] <eggsu> Bonfires checkpoints in disguise

[2022-12-24 12:35:08] <Shirousa> maybe they lost the rights to reuse the music
[2022-12-24 12:35:12] <Biako11> its more detailed and confusing and a bit darker.
[2022-12-24 12:35:12] <GrimWisp> do you know of any bosses in this game or completely blind
[2022-12-24 12:35:25] <%Remotoz> @benderloin you could but she gets stealthed so dcorv cant force provkes. Not too familiar with the matchup though
[2022-12-24 12:35:30] <Biako11> guys yall remember the death penalty of Demon souls? whenever you died shit got harder and harder to the point people give up.
[2022-12-24 12:35:36] <Biako11> its like NG+1 every death KEKW
