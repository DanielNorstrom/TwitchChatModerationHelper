[2022-12-31 10:26:08] <!HawoooBakeinu> Frostpunk also has an Endless mode to play after you've beaten all Scenarios. But the endless scenario won't have a super storm like the main scenario. After each storm the world map will change though.

[2022-12-31 10:27:01] <!HawoooBakeinu> The Endless mode has 3 scenarios by the way Ceri. One where you start with a generator. One where you first have to build a generator and then use it to warm the city. And one where you have no generator altogether.
[2022-12-31 10:27:11] <%KaitoOnTheClock> I woke up early to shower and to catch the stream. But only negative is that no one will wake up until like 12-13 KEKW

[2022-12-31 10:35:38] <!HawoooBakeinu> One more piece of advice. Building space adjusts to the space available. So if you build a road the circle around the construction site is disrupted. Meaning if you build buildings there now their size gets adjusted to the disrupted circle. Either making them slightly bigger or smaller. Making them perfectly fill the space between roads.

If a journey to an unexplored spot next to an explored spot takes 3 days. The journey to the explored spot takes like 1 day and then 2 hours from there to the new spot. For example.

[2022-12-31 11:34:48] <!HawoooBakeinu> Engineers are more clever indeed. And get stuff done for real. But what we got nowadays irl is actually the worker route taken LUL
[2022-12-31 11:34:50] <EmperorsArmpits> see the bigger picture, but not the person in the picture :D
[2022-12-31 11:34:54] <Nashikage> It's a either or route. They will each have their own unique issues and buildings. Like going faith or order in the basic game.
[2022-12-31 11:35:16] <!HawoooBakeinu> Playing this scenario on both routes is worth it

[2022-12-31 12:25:53] <+SkittlesTC> i gotta forage irl
[2022-12-31 12:25:54] <!HawoooBakeinu> Stockpiling tons of food is good
[2022-12-31 12:26:15] <TheNakriin> people starting using their fireworks two days ago already... i dpont really get why they dont just forbid selling fireworks till the 30th/31st
[2022-12-31 12:26:44] <nppolter> ahh cerise dont worry about it, people are hungry but not starving yet
[2022-12-31 12:26:51] <!HawoooBakeinu> Private fireworks should be forbidden...
[2022-12-31 12:27:11] <!HawoooBakeinu> Just a few days ago ppl bought fireworks and then burned down the same supermarket they bought it from. With the same fireworks they bought.
[2022-12-31 12:27:23] <TheNakriin> that would be even better. but i doubt that will happen in the next 10 or so years
[2022-12-31 12:27:25] <!HawoooBakeinu> Yes it was in the news
[2022-12-31 12:27:31] <bunglinglummox> Governments won't ban fireworks unless there's a big public outcry about it. Otherwise they just look like party poopers.
[2022-12-31 12:27:32] <%$Memil03> Yee we have baned firework in our village beacuse all the animals are so scared
[2022-12-31 12:27:34] <nppolter> i dont like the idea of forbidding fireworks and ruining a new year's tradition over a select few idiots
[2022-12-31 12:27:34] <+SkittlesTC> I don't really wanna ban people from doing shit but honestly a lot of people just aren't responsible enough for that stuff

[2022-12-31 12:27:49] <!HawoooBakeinu> Instead of throwing rocks they shoot fireworks at cars instead atm
[2022-12-31 12:28:10] <$sircool099> it all came apart when you kept that guy's nudie picture
[2022-12-31 12:28:16] <!HawoooBakeinu> Private fireworks should be completely forbidden...
[2022-12-31 12:28:27] <+SkittlesTC> This time for REAL
[2022-12-31 12:28:39] <nppolter> @HawoooBakeinu because a select few are idiots?
[2022-12-31 12:28:44] <%GaeaRosa> To be fair, banning fireworks is iffy, most of the arguments that can be made for it, can be made for banning alcohol as well.
[2022-12-31 12:28:48] <!HawoooBakeinu> An early bathtub is good. Might wanna plan in the place for bathtubs and chapels when placing tents Ceri
[2022-12-31 12:28:55] <+SkittlesTC> Yeah that's the slippery slope of banning stuff
[2022-12-31 12:29:10] <+SkittlesTC> Sometimes I'll be driving and think 'wow i'm allowed to drive this death machine around and people just have to trust me'
[2022-12-31 12:29:14] <+SkittlesTC> Gotta be careful
[2022-12-31 12:29:15] <TheNakriin> fireworks in any kind of hands do passive damage though
[2022-12-31 12:29:20] <TheNakriin> alcohol in the right hands doesnt

[2022-12-31 12:29:49] <!HawoooBakeinu> @HawoooBakeinu And then there are those morons that shoot hundreds of euros of fireworks. from a week before new year's eve till a week after. But they never clean up. Just showing all the dirt onto the neighbor's properties claiming they have to clean it up then. Even though those neighbors never shot even a single firworks rocket...
[2022-12-31 12:29:58] <!HawoooBakeinu> ah yes I heard of that!
[2022-12-31 12:30:01] <Kruschewsky> D:
[2022-12-31 12:30:03] <+SkittlesTC> I guess I just have adopted the mentality that I have to release my fears and worries, I can't control things
[2022-12-31 12:30:04] <!HawoooBakeinu> I think the monkey house caught on fire
[2022-12-31 12:30:20] <+SkittlesTC> Focus more on my own existence, just feel happier that way
[2022-12-31 12:30:43] <bunglinglummox> You can't really issue a large scale ban on something just because you don't like it.
[2022-12-31 12:30:45] <!HawoooBakeinu> those idiots bought chinese flying lanterns and set them off illegally because ''they are pretty''. As a result dozens of animals in the zoo died and millions of property damage came to be
[2022-12-31 12:31:00] <+SkittlesTC> @bunglinglummox Yeah starts to feel a bit too reactionary
[2022-12-31 12:31:09] <!HawoooBakeinu> And those guys only had to pay off like a 10,000 € fine. For mass murder of animals. And doing MILLIONS of € of damage.
[2022-12-31 12:31:27] <+SkittlesTC> There's just too much in this world to be outraged about, it's healthier for your own mind to release control
[2022-12-31 12:31:36] VIEWERS: 243
[2022-12-31 12:31:50] <!HawoooBakeinu> The only fireworks allowed should be professional large-scale fireworks supervised by pyrotechnicians.
[2022-12-31 12:31:54] <TheNakriin> @bunglinglummox what if it causes harm at almost all times of usages?
[2022-12-31 12:32:04] <!HawoooBakeinu> Not only are those safer. They also got a choreography. And are prettier
[2022-12-31 12:32:04] <bunglinglummox> @TheNakriin Then explain why and how.
[2022-12-31 12:32:21] <bunglinglummox> Fireworks don't meet that criteria.
[2022-12-31 12:32:26] <+SkittlesTC> It's pretty easy to claim that most things are 'always' harmful as long as you pick major incidents as evidence

[2022-12-31 12:35:06] <@%LT_Jakal> let them be stinky, proves they worked hard lol
[2022-12-31 12:35:17] <TheNakriin> @bunglinglummox The explosions of fireworks can cause some people and almost all animals react in high panic, increasing their stress levels by such amounts that they suffer greatly from it. I have a friend who actually has to flee to a place far off the fireworks areas because of this each new years. Furthering on this, the amount of idiots that burn down buildings, explode the fireworks on the streets and actively hurt other people directly is insanly fucking high
[2022-12-31 12:35:25] <!HawoooBakeinu> But yes Ceri. Lead me make a proper example of this
[2022-12-31 12:35:26] <+SkittlesTC> I dunno, a little settlement around a forest and body of water seems kinda nice

[2022-12-31 12:36:54] <bunglinglummox> @TheNakriin So your argument is that *some* people and animals are inconvenienced. Counterpoint: you can say that about anything. Also re: animals... that is a whole can of worms. There is a *lot* of debate about where to draw the line and what you can and can't do to animals. It leads into the whole veganism debate.
[2022-12-31 12:37:05] <@%LT_Jakal> Whatever I just said, ignore it, I side with Cerise
[2022-12-31 12:37:32] <+SkittlesTC> @bunglinglummox One can make a pretty large argument against this just by pointing out oversocialization and maladjustment of society has prevented people from healing and developing proper management strategies.

[2022-12-31 12:39:52] <nppolter> big heater in the game, yes, but not at home, but "sadly" temperatures went up to 15°C where i live again
[2022-12-31 12:40:11] <bunglinglummox> @TheNakriin There are people and animals that feel that way about e.g. men. Should we ban men?
[2022-12-31 12:40:18] <+SkittlesTC> @bunglinglummox People can get like this over absolutely anything when put under enough trauma, it's not a good excuse for a blanket ban. It's a good example for why we need proper therapy access

[2022-12-31 12:42:22] <TheNakriin> @bunglinglummox now you are trying to move this ad absurdum. You can ban unnatural things (explosions) that create a natural fear, but for something that creates unnatural fear (of men in your example) its an entirely different argumentative basis in that is has none

[2022-12-31 12:43:38] <bunglinglummox> @TheNakriin The "[terror] to the point of not being able to stay where [they]" are is just as unnatural. It's a result of trauma, which is experiential and is the *actual* problem.
[2022-12-31 12:43:42] <+SkittlesTC> i prefer a good burger for motivation but ya know whatever works

[2022-12-31 13:05:36] VIEWERS: 262
[2022-12-31 13:05:40] <!HawoooBakeinu> Or B - You have spare generator materials to improvise safe solutions
[2022-12-31 13:06:00] <!HawoooBakeinu> Both work. At B some people may still get hurt, but nobody will die. And you wont get major setbacks
[2022-12-31 13:06:50] <@%LT_Jakal> I hear it
[2022-12-31 13:06:58] <!HawoooBakeinu> On research there also are buildings to improve the safety level. But they burn metric fucktons of coal.
