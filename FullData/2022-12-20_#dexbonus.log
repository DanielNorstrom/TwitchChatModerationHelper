[2022-12-20 15:27:03] <%puhtahtoe> have you gone back as an adult to any of the cool stuff you found in the woods?
[2022-12-20 15:27:05] <%xeratun> i also used to go way out in the woods as a kid. As an adult now, its wild how far away we went and my parents had no clue where we got off to. We went miles away, there's no way they'd find us if they went looking
[2022-12-20 15:27:08] <+Ernedar> Building wild homes, dams at springs, ship from tree bark, playing knights and castles.... We done in woods things current generation children will maybe never know.

[2022-12-20 15:27:27] <%Noiremun> Czechia has a thing that kids in the woods build tiny little "gnome houses". It's kinda charming to come across them
[2022-12-20 15:27:37] <%+Plasmafenix> Did you get the talk about root rolls atleast?
[2022-12-20 15:27:42] <%nickoftime16> "What do you know, DAD?!" *underground fort fails*
[2022-12-20 15:27:45] <%xeratun> One time got so far away and were really thirsty and just went up to a random person who happened to be outside and asked for water lol
[2022-12-20 15:28:03] <%+Plasmafenix> We got told a lot to not go near them in school and by my parents
[2022-12-20 15:28:47] <%+Plasmafenix> Uprooted trees
[2022-12-20 15:28:53] <%Noiremun> They are just houses made from sticks and woods yes, but they are tiny, as if sprites live in them :) they get real creative with materials

[2022-12-20 15:29:25] <%$yotoll> One time my mom was spending way too long at church, and I just walked home cause I was bored. Small town, so I managed just fine, but it was not a short walk and I got in big trouble.
[2022-12-20 15:29:33] <%RMutt1917> like fairy circles ppl leave in the woods

[2022-12-20 15:29:47] <%+jareel99> They were building a bunch of new houses behind my parent's house when I was kid, so all our forts were made with old pallets, sheets of plastic and scaffolding boards. The builders must have hated us

[2022-12-20 15:31:00] <purplewubba> I'd say alcohol
[2022-12-20 15:31:04] <%+The_Dawnseeker> usually some form of alcohol

[2022-12-20 15:31:20] <MsTacker> I used to make "perfume" with a friend and it was literally us just adding a bunch of soaps together in water lmao
[2022-12-20 15:31:28] <+Ernedar> Not alcohol. Fat
[2022-12-20 15:31:29] <VaultdwellerLee> Alcohol and fats
[2022-12-20 15:31:31] <%nickoftime16> I remember playing imaginary Harry Potter battle scenes with my buddy as a kid. So many cool sticks "wands"
[2022-12-20 15:31:35] <Mojestic_Unicorn> probably infuse in oil and then add that oil to alcohol
[2022-12-20 15:31:35] <%$ozfroggirl> Oils would hold smell longer
[2022-12-20 15:31:42] <+MIDDLIN> They were alcohol cus my granny is allergic and got anaplaptic shocks when she wanted to go out lol
[2022-12-20 15:31:42] <+Ernedar> Oils do take scents best
[2022-12-20 15:31:52] <%tellyrose_> as a little kid I definitely used puddles and pond water...I'm not sure it was a great perfume but I had fun doogLaugh
[2022-12-20 15:31:56] <%Akabara86> we had tons of raspberries and blackberries growing in the woods i grew up near so not only did i get to wonder the woods but i would usually come back with berries
[2022-12-20 15:32:02] <%$KyltsO> stripNote
[2022-12-20 15:32:04] <%+The_Dawnseeker> depends on what kind of substance you're trying to extract I guess
[2022-12-20 15:32:22] <$0biTom> You should read Patrick Süskind's Perfume, it's a great classic
[2022-12-20 15:32:24] <+Riptide62> You were ahead of your time

[2022-12-20 15:33:49] <%+Qubehog> Yeah most recommendation if you're making perfumes are gonna call for ethanol based solutions since it evaporates around body temperature once you apply it to your skin.
[2022-12-20 15:33:50] <%nickoftime16> They'd be sticks that we'd tie rocks onto. And we'd "sharpen" them against the tree bark LUL
[2022-12-20 15:33:54] <$Shamalaim> We made bows out of pvc pipes !! So i guess we were rangers

[2022-12-20 15:34:21] <%nickoftime16> we'd use grass as rope to attach the rocks. They'd last for, like 1 throw. But MAN, what a rush!

[2022-12-20 15:35:42] <%+bakavic> have you tried the latest sonic game?
[2022-12-20 15:35:49] <$Shamalaim> Best classic weapon was any pipe slightly bigger than a straw and rowan berries, perfect blowpipe
[2022-12-20 15:35:51] <Ipsenscastle> The UK Sonic comics were really weird, Super Sonic was like an evil Mr-Hyde-type character who wanted to kill Sonic's friends, it was nuts
[2022-12-20 15:35:54] <%+S9Stryc9> I watched a video about the comics recently about how one of the artists for it was a bit weird.

It changed me. I started shrimping ironically, but I was wrong. Its amazing, I'm smarter, more productive, more focused at work, a simple task is now much better. Outsiders dont get it, they dont get us. I'm not saying were better but were more open minded and probably smarter. I love this community, and I love this way of life. 🦐
