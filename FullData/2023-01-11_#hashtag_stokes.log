[2023-01-11 10:53:47] <!%Jack_B> hes so so one footed its frustrating
[2023-01-11 10:53:51] <%+Harwoodinho> When's best time to sell Lucio? Price is constantly fluctuating ffs

[2023-01-11 10:54:19] <%kyleharker> I‚Äôm a massive united fan but Antony has been underwhelming, his overall game is bad! Hoping he can improve next season
[2023-01-11 10:54:25] <!%+acluvsufan> Seen you been dodging me in champs nerd
[2023-01-11 10:54:26] <!%Jack_B> meta cards seemed to rise a tiny bit since yesterday
[2023-01-11 10:54:28] <@%Jayden4433> TOTY Militao >>>>>>>>>
[2023-01-11 10:54:28] <+Taylor_98> Yeh massive talent but needs to use his right so many times he could cross it or make a attacking pass and he would cut back on his left
[2023-01-11 10:54:30] <%followthesponge> hopefully team of the week isnt dead. have 6 totw packs saved up
[2023-01-11 10:54:30] <%+chainzsyy> Attackers Friday Mids Sunday Defenders Tuesday Full Team Thursday 12th Friday

[2023-01-11 10:54:55] <%trippyerror> my prayer is that vvd doesn't finesse into toty
[2023-01-11 10:54:56] <%anqlo__> Vvd will be crazy if he gets in

[2023-01-11 12:41:43] <%cj_nsza> @creezyback when 83 is going up?
[2023-01-11 12:41:44] <@%$CreezyBACK> Position modified after 100 unassigned
[2023-01-11 12:41:46] <+fordykyle1> high rated fodder will be useful with toty sbc,s potential mbappe potm mbappe and toty icons etc
[2023-01-11 12:41:51] <itsRamzilla> youtube it
[2023-01-11 12:41:55] <waffling_nr1> I dont agree, the pack weight of 83s will be so high it wont be good enough
[2023-01-11 12:41:57] <%+DaveTheRed> Glitch is do any SBC or Objective that gives you a new card, you can BIN after again
[2023-01-11 12:41:57] <saigerorkd> U
[2023-01-11 12:42:01] <@%+lizardking82> There is no glitch *wink wink. You never know who is watching
[2023-01-11 12:42:01] <@%$CreezyBACK> After you got 100 unassigned
[2023-01-11 12:42:12] <@%$CreezyBACK> Then you‚Äôre free to buy unlimited
[2023-01-11 12:42:13] <%thierrynikolas> Basically u need to add something to ur transdfer pule by force if that makes sense,
[2023-01-11 12:42:13] <Waveth21> it doesnt just have to be position modifier, it can be kits, player picks, anything that goes into your unassigned
[2023-01-11 12:42:14] <%slurmywords> 83s aren't your best bet. You can only buy so many. They are low risk yes but with SBCs going to be dropped on TOY and you have the coins 89s+ are the way forward

[2023-01-11 12:43:13] <Waveth21> im expecting 83's to go to 2k+ at their peak

[2023-01-11 12:43:42] <psycho_chill> You have to buy 1k+ cards to be worth it. It takes so much time and you can also get banned because of it

[2023-01-11 12:50:51] <%slurmywords> Based on past info, the week before TOTY prices will drop. Trying to time it is difficult tbh, but  a few days before is usually fine
[2023-01-11 12:50:51] <%DM_XI> max cards you can list in 24 hours is 3k i believe, before you get shadow banned
[2023-01-11 12:50:52] <+lfcnathann> its 11k
[2023-01-11 12:50:52] <McSauce1> should ido the reds upgrade now or is it a reason to wait? like can u use them to get toty or something?

[2023-01-11 12:51:28] <@%$CreezyBACK> Only need to do the glitch once

[2023-01-11 12:51:46] <!joshibet06> you have to do until you soft banned
[2023-01-11 12:51:47] <!%007sheikh> stokes trust me 11 mill would take at least 10 days cos of soft bans etc while buying
[2023-01-11 12:51:47] <bizhunter_> u need to do it every relog

[2023-01-11 12:52:14] <%BaIdMonk> You can evade the soft ban if you use web :)
[2023-01-11 12:52:15] <gurubiggie7> you can buy like 300 cards with one glitch, but can change to ps4 version to get another 300 cards before ban
