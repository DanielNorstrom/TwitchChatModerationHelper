[2022-12-23 00:00:37] <%+bdpnguins> Tbh those two aren’t that shabby for price and lifespan

[2022-12-23 22:00:21] <+Tezerok> you probably still want drawers with refined for mass storage
[2022-12-23 22:00:24] <+theinsaneeraser> reduced disk usage
[2022-12-23 22:00:24] <tsboehm1> You will want both drawers and rs
[2022-12-23 22:00:24] <%+Nfora> So you don't need to use up disk space
[2022-12-23 22:00:27] <am_andrew> u really wanna storage drawers it makes storing items much cheaper
[2022-12-23 22:00:29] <%+bdpnguins> EHHH drawers require ALOT of chromatic steel
[2022-12-23 22:00:30] <+Blade_xeon> mmmm you kinda need both
[2022-12-23 22:00:30] <+Tezerok> his rs is connected to drawers
[2022-12-23 22:00:32] <%+LaLaBriar> they work better togrther than alone
[2022-12-23 22:00:33] <Filsklor> in drawer u can store million of items
[2022-12-23 22:00:34] <%Tr1cks7er> If u can make 8*16K discks we dont need drawers
[2022-12-23 22:00:34] <+Ribery931> drawer work well with refined storage
[2022-12-23 22:00:41] <+alayna_is_here> Pete has both
[2022-12-23 22:00:42] <lucieluc137> pete has both
[2022-12-23 22:00:50] <+JordanS1101> You want drawers if using refine storage. They don’t take up disk space
[2022-12-23 22:00:51] <Filsklor> in a 64 k disk, just 64 k items ^^
[2022-12-23 22:00:52] <%19Null7> It is recommended to use drawers for bulk storage because the rf storage cards are pretty expensive
[2022-12-23 22:00:55] <tsboehm1> Disks cost a lot still, so using drawers for items with large quantities is helpful
[2022-12-23 22:01:06] <+Ribery931> both is gud.
[2022-12-23 22:01:11] <+bowenalexander> Drawers are great storage of huge amounts of items... takes up less space and is more cost effective than everything in RS
[2022-12-23 22:01:18] <%Tr1cks7er> u need power as well
[2022-12-23 22:01:19] <%Maiionaise> RS can work by itself buy its really expensive for storage so you wanna have drawers

[2022-12-23 22:01:31] <%+LaLaBriar> yeah
[2022-12-23 22:01:41] <%+Nfora> Pretty cheap to make drawers. Compacting drawers is pricey. Some of the capacity upgrades are expensive
[2022-12-23 22:01:44] <%+bdpnguins> Where are you going to put them tho?
[2022-12-23 22:01:45] <TOTHEMOON11> u can make 2x2 drawrs too

[2022-12-23 22:02:22] <%+bdpnguins> I know you need a drawer controller
[2022-12-23 22:02:22] <+Tezerok> or you can use jade
[2022-12-23 22:02:45] <%+Nfora> So that particular drawer can only be used for that item
[2022-12-23 22:02:49] <Filsklor> so it remember even when empty
[2022-12-23 22:02:51] <+trippiegin> locks items
[2022-12-23 22:02:52] <+Tezerok> if you import into a system
[2022-12-23 22:02:54] <joeri_van> so it keeps the memory of the contents
[2022-12-23 22:02:56] <Filsklor> and nothing go in
[2022-12-23 22:02:56] <+theinsaneeraser> when you take all out it remembers what was in it

[2022-12-23 22:03:17] <+Tezerok> there are 2x1 and 2x2 for that
[2022-12-23 22:03:18] <Filsklor> nothing except what u choose ofc

[2022-12-23 22:03:22] <+theinsaneeraser> but when you take all of the item out it wont retain the info unless it's locked\
[2022-12-23 22:03:25] <+bowenalexander> if it is locked
[2022-12-23 22:03:27] <+Ribery931> u can have 2×2  with 4 diff item
[2022-12-23 22:03:34] <+ShapNine> there are multi drawers
[2022-12-23 22:03:36] <%Maiionaise> If its not lock and it got empty other items might go in
[2022-12-23 22:03:39] <mmdonuts> don't really need a key if you're just using filtered link cables
[2022-12-23 22:03:43] <arcanajinx> click the A
[2022-12-23 22:03:44] <+theinsaneeraser> hit the a
[2022-12-23 22:03:44] <%+Nfora> Use a quantify key on the drawer
[2022-12-23 22:03:44] <KaomiMio> you can make a 2x2 drawer which can hold 4 different items in one block
[2022-12-23 22:03:49] <TOTHEMOON11> sort by amount
[2022-12-23 22:03:52] <+Tezerok> the A can chance to amount instead

[2022-12-23 22:22:05] <%+Nfora> idk, the attack speed probably wrecks it compared to a sword

[2022-12-23 22:22:53] <tsboehm1> Barely more and slower. Sword better.
[2022-12-23 22:22:54] <Unknown17z> Sword you can basically spam
[2022-12-23 22:23:06] <%+bdpnguins> You do approximately 37 damage with that axe adding the increased damage
[2022-12-23 22:23:12] <Filsklor> t2 att speed, 1.27 could be worst tbh

[2022-12-23 22:31:52] <%+bdpnguins> @unknown17z no I think it’s 40%
[2022-12-23 22:31:58] <Unknown17z> Oh my
[2022-12-23 22:32:03] <%+bdpnguins> It starts at 10% I think
[2022-12-23 22:32:08] <Unknown17z> It does
[2022-12-23 22:32:13] <%+bdpnguins> It costs 1 or 4 points I think I forgot
[2022-12-23 22:32:23] <Unknown17z> 4 i would assume
[2022-12-23 22:32:33] <%+bdpnguins> Again it is still broken
[2022-12-23 22:32:42] <%DrTasslehoff> Blacksmith is 3-3-4-4 points, and is 10-15-20-25% chance to not use potential

[2022-12-23 22:33:14] <Unknown17z> 25% is still 1/4 of not using crafting potential
[2022-12-23 22:33:15] <%+bdpnguins> It’s PRETTY good tho ngl

[2022-12-23 22:49:05] <someguyisacommonname> it goes to 9% at 32, it's .06 until level 32

[2022-12-23 22:50:50] <Zaborca2000> It basically makes you pick specialization on level 32, going with pure rampage beforehand
