[2022-12-09 00:10:43] <AJ_Hyper_Bit> all of this depends on what version of the character you are referencing, like sure when Tony was at the beginning was 100% an asshole, clearly didn't care for anything but himself, by the end though he had changed at lot, only based off to movies since I know comics have their own shit KEKW

[2022-12-09 01:09:00] <+VoidField101> @GandalfTheTeak I have that camera. Depth data in cameras is nothing new. XBox Kinect had that. But Iphone has a special Machine Learning algorithm added to it's OS that makes the magic. Intel cams don't come with that

[2022-12-09 01:22:49] <%Shizounu> I should stop thinking about this before I actually try and make it

[2022-12-09 01:23:35] <%Tadas13571> so there dancer because there is more water in the same space so it works exactly as the name suggests. because density is how much stuff there is in a given space so if something is more dence so if the cloud is more dence it will have more water
[2022-12-09 01:23:44] <esro_medows> Different color fires and smoke depends on the material that‚Äôs burning the oxygen dioxide mix or a combination of both

[2022-12-09 21:23:37] <%weewee53r86> but most ads aren't even entertaining to sit through
[2022-12-09 21:23:45] <%weewee53r86> so I don't wanna buy what they're selling
[2022-12-09 21:23:45] <8vantor8> All of them were 10 seconds tho
[2022-12-09 21:23:45] <%$huntsman_of_atlas> What would you do for a Klondike bar?

[2022-12-09 21:24:03] <%RatsRump> Also, the thought of gettign like 10 is so the ads can be shown less often,so they show them all at once
[2022-12-09 21:24:03] <%$LederIappen> BTW, do you guys ever play Overwatch ranked, and have your Healer be totally ass?
