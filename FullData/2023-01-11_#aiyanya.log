[2023-01-11 10:07:26] <+IzludeTingel> I can understand what they were trying to do.  They were trying to remove DOT's and remove the fact that it has 3 rotations.  However I feel that they missed it with the update and they also ADDED an additional button with Bulwark.  Paladin is already the most button loaded class in the game and they have not consolidated any of it.
[2023-01-11 10:07:53] <+IzludeTingel> Personally I have no issue with pots 1 per fight.

[2023-01-11 10:08:55] <!%dyseal> I think its just making classes have different time periods for their burst, so aligning them and potting in a reopener is more optimisation
[2023-01-11 10:09:04] <@%kantokii> PAUSERS
[2023-01-11 10:09:16] <loxdiax> ..
[2023-01-11 10:09:39] <!%dyseal> T%he thing is, theres no room for optimisation in fights now
[2023-01-11 10:09:39] <+IzludeTingel> The root of this whole issue is really simple.  NOBODY over in the devs actually plays Paladin.  They play Warrior, Gunbreaker, and Dark Knight for sure but after all these years and how they always miss the mark with Paladin updates it starts to show, nobody plays it over there.
[2023-01-11 10:09:44] <!%dyseal> so its mechanically a bit boring

[2023-01-11 10:11:00] <loxdiax> ?
[2023-01-11 10:11:25] <+IzludeTingel> Yeah I'm sure there's a full rework in store for 7.0 that they couldn't roll out due to level 100 abilities.
[2023-01-11 10:11:26] <Vulpurr> there is a shit ton of after story content
[2023-01-11 10:11:29] <loxdiax> i finish the main story but was wondering how far i can go without dlcs
[2023-01-11 10:11:34] <@%Dark_Fable> from the patch notes it does seem like Yoshi-P has this "what are we doing with jobs post 7.0" stuff lingering on his mind
[2023-01-11 10:11:51] <@%kantokii> @loxdiax do u mean arr? heavensward is included in the trial
[2023-01-11 10:11:51] <Moonsworth> all through heavensward if you're free trial
[2023-01-11 10:12:12] <+IzludeTingel> Also if they could knock it off with the door boss mechanics that would be great, I still hate p8s.
[2023-01-11 10:12:22] <@%Dark_Fable> @loxdiax yeah theres a lot of content in the trial outside the MSQ

[2023-01-11 10:15:44] <+IzludeTingel> I liked how in the HW Sophia where Dark Knights got their shit kicked in because they were used to being top tier with Warrior Bros and then suddenly had physical tank busters instead of magic ones.  Suddenly the Paladins were brought out of the chained up storage chest and allowed to do a fight.
[2023-01-11 10:16:33] <Moonsworth> I remember people melding lightning resistance back when Sophia ex came out LUL

[2023-01-11 10:42:40] <Moonsworth> I think cruise chaser had something similar didn't it, if you didn't get knock back it didn't do damage right? but it's been a while so maybe I'm remembering wrong

[2023-01-11 13:02:53] <@%Dark_Fable> @Kelmir_osue zero chance theyre shipping her with a Hrothgar now that theyre making fem hroth
[2023-01-11 13:03:13] <+ProfessorHojo_> the reason they dont do love interest is due to the wedding system
[2023-01-11 13:03:15] <Kelmir_osue> I'm 100% believe they're gonna do that
[2023-01-11 13:03:24] <+ProfessorHojo_> thats your love interest you have to find them in game.....
[2023-01-11 13:03:51] <!%+Edrem> imagine they announce femhroth in 7.0 by introducing runnars new gf
[2023-01-11 13:03:54] <%$nemafow> Love? In this economy??

[2023-01-11 13:04:14] <Kelmir_osue> @Dark_Fable They're probably still gonna do it. Remember that they want a new group of characters in 7.0
[2023-01-11 13:04:20] <+ProfessorHojo_> BUT if you are interested in a four legged cat guy.... boy do i have a character for you....
