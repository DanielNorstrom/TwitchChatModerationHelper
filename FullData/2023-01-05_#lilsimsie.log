[2023-01-05 21:57:58] <%+PharieFire> @faith_h I don't think so. I've had the same issue.
[2023-01-05 21:58:03] <%$dru_skellyington> @faith_h it's quite possible your prime sub isn't up for use yet? it comes available every 30 days
[2023-01-05 21:58:20] <+faith_h> I’ll wait til I get home then thanks
[2023-01-05 21:58:20] <~%lilsimsie> you can't prime sub from iphone

[2023-01-05 21:58:25] <%+FlooringDemo> @faith_h I've had trouble in the past. Also sometimes it won't let you until the day after it expires. They make it difficult :(

Suggestions are always appreciated, but do not attempt to make demands or force Kayla to do anything. There is a difference between friendly suggestions and aggressive demands.

[2023-01-05 22:25:54] <electriclanee> if your twitch bugs out and says you are not following simsie, do not click follow! It didnt unfollow simsie for you, it's just a bug, however if you click follow (in my own experience) this will cause it to unfollow simsie!!! just leave it alone and it'll get fixed!

[2023-01-05 22:45:23] <lulubao_> snap is sooooo cute
[2023-01-05 22:45:23] <%+herbaI_tea> the screen only went black for like 20sec. for me, and only once
[2023-01-05 22:45:25] <%$jenniferlundqvist> i mean, twice in 45 minutes is not that much, it's not like it's constant
[2023-01-05 22:45:26] <m_lee08> Snap being cute makes it worth the struggle
[2023-01-05 22:45:27] <JadeBeki95> If it’s happens a few move times then stop streaming I guess
[2023-01-05 22:45:28] <l_kalani> its not too bad, just refresh my page and it comes back
[2023-01-05 22:45:28] <xenoholica> it comes and goes, it's not constantly out

[2023-01-05 23:33:03] <%clauria11> the light bed is nice. i think it's more realistic to have not super matching stuff. it's the concept that ties them together
[2023-01-05 23:33:04] <froggyballs101> Period 💅🏽
[2023-01-05 23:33:04] <%+ThatGirlShelbyy> I like this a lot actually! It’s a super cool vibe
[2023-01-05 23:33:06] <1kyles1> @seafoampudding I’ll look into that one then thanks for the suggestion. There’s a lot of people split on that pack so I wasn’t sure if I should go for it
[2023-01-05 23:33:06] <modernwednesday> it's not so berry, it's meant to be a bit wild

[2023-01-05 23:33:14] <%$userlameuserlame> no backseat gaming smh
[2023-01-05 23:33:14] <%misscalendula> it is not Kayla's fault that the sims lacks purple options
[2023-01-05 23:33:14] <charcole6> is the accent wall base game

[2023-01-05 23:33:41] <tigersaymeow_> You asked if they go together and I feel like the bed is a completely different vibe. It’ll be interesting to see id the blues can pull them together, though
[2023-01-05 23:33:41] <%+dysia16> use the bear livingchair! simsiePog
[2023-01-05 23:33:41] <m_doxx> I have to give myself creative liberty when I do this challenge (I'm playing it now)

[2023-01-05 23:59:15] <%Dawnie3296> Chloe was 5 1/2 weeks when I got her, she was born feral, so we didn't know the actual date so we gave her my Mom's birthday but we really don't know. Bonnie adopted her and took care of her since she didn't have a Mom.
