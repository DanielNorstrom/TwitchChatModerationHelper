[2022-12-17 00:01:01] <$RedSpade83> An inugami, meaning "dog god," are a type of yokai in Japanese mythology. They resemble, and usually originate from, a dog, (although other similar species are interpreted as being. e.g., wolves, raccoons and weasels.) and most commonly carrying out vengeance or acting as guardians on behalf of their "inugami owner." They are also occasionally summoned by onmyoji to do their will.

[2022-12-17 00:01:21] <%Ayoub13Berrahel> monkaS So in what place do I exist now, I'm alone in my room
[2022-12-17 00:01:23] <%+Druken_Reaps> Entire chat ceases to be
[2022-12-17 00:01:26] <%+famousreflex> but i'm alone in a room and you acknowledged my existence
[2022-12-17 00:01:28] <Snoozy_Z_Bear> Wait, so i don‚Äôt exist
[2022-12-17 00:01:28] <+Monkiy> If no one is in the room to hear you scream, do you even really die?
[2022-12-17 00:01:31] <readreadchopper> if i fall over and no one sees did I really hurt myself?
[2022-12-17 00:01:33] <%+ChameleonJae> So my working at home alone in my room is just my work doing itself as I no longer exist! Nice!
[2022-12-17 00:01:34] <Zantagio> does it count if we're acknowledging each others existence over pixels?

[2022-12-17 00:02:05] <+ArgonFalcon> i have a cat un Mt room, does that mean I get to exist?

[2022-12-17 00:06:50] <$RedSpade83> How long the practice of creating inugami begun is unknown. However, by the Heian period the practice had already been outlawed along with the use of other animal spirits as tools of sorcery. According to legend, the creation of an inugami is accomplished like this: the head of a starved dog must be cut off. Then, the severed head is buried in the street ‚Äî usually a crossroads where many people pass. The trampling of hundreds or thousands of people over this buried head would add to its stress--

[2022-12-17 00:07:28] <$RedSpade83> and cause the animal‚Äôs spirit to transform into an onry≈ç (a powerful maleficent spirit). Occasionally these severed heads were said to escape and fly about, chasing after food, animated solely by the onry≈ç‚Äôs anger ‚Äî such was the power of the dog‚Äôs hunger. The head was then baked or dried and enshrined in a bowl, after which the spirit could be used as a kind of ****** by a wicked sorcerer, doing whatever he or she commanded for the rest of time.
[2022-12-17 00:07:43] <%DancingCorpse> I never understood that, why do advertisers get to choose what kind of streamers their ads will come up on, but streamers can't choose?  Not fair IMO.
