[2022-12-09 01:02:33] <in_a_hurri> they trademarked leaks so they most likely did profit
[2022-12-09 01:02:37] <riolu124> if you want whos next, you wont spend on the banner its on and wait, thus making you more likely to not spend money
[2022-12-09 01:02:37] <TetraTesseract> they made less from leaking than you did with one video
[2022-12-09 01:02:38] <ChaoticCheshire24> huh

[2022-12-09 23:20:34] <ZeaDraa> @XxColethekidCVxX Agreed
[2022-12-09 23:20:36] <yakuhinaaaa> The butterfly effect is the idea that small things can have non-linear impacts on a complex system. The concept is imagined with a butterfly flapping its wings and causing a typhoon. Of course, a single act like the butterfly flapping its wings cannot cause a typhoon.
