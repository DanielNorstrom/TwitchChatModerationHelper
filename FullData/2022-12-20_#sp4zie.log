[2022-12-20 15:32:38] <Jujoma> Hey Sp4zie! Not a TFT-related question, but since you are now playing League more often, have you ever considered inviting guests to your games like in old times? Thebausffs should be a fun guest since he is also Swed and a fan of you <3 here's a clip of him saying that he watched you a lot during League times: https://clips.twitch.tv/SpookySpicyArmadilloSmoocherZ-2VWfvogjYCJknDGX
[2022-12-20 15:32:40] <%AemenNae> the ball is just an egg if you think about it
