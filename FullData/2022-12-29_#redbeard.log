[2022-12-29 06:16:53] <sleeve_of_roses> Your camera covers up the number of cards left in the opponents deck at the end of the match where the information is most interesting. Would it block anything if it was next to your name instead?

[2022-12-29 06:27:36] <DFOJoe> redbeard is it really a card impression if you're clearly the voice acting talent behind it?

[2022-12-29 06:31:44] <@%Tazny> Maybe you need to see a chiropractor or do some physical therapy
[2022-12-29 06:31:50] <DFOJoe> when you were talking about your back pain yesterday, it was too real, I relate
[2022-12-29 06:31:58] <DFOJoe> I'm 32 but my back feels 72

[2022-12-29 06:32:54] <thepigmann> You're not ready for the kind of $$$ that would net you
[2022-12-29 06:32:55] <!%kingcharles__69> its because a chiropracter is never just a chiropracter. they always have a quirk. "im a great chiro and also believe that you can cure cancer with rocks"
[2022-12-29 06:33:24] <StarsyNA> my co-workers have gone to a chiropractor for years and amazingly their backs / shoulder / hips never seem to get better
[2022-12-29 06:33:29] <StarsyNA> they gotta keep going back..

[2022-12-29 06:34:47] <DFOJoe> Is this why it's not improving RedBeard5Head
[2022-12-29 06:34:47] <%medricx> physical therapist is much more qualified to cure long term pain
[2022-12-29 06:34:50] <%+Jurbek> you at least solve our problems
[2022-12-29 06:35:05] <+texasisbig> like restaurants man.. they treat your hunger but never really quite cure it.. its a scam!

[2022-12-29 06:37:04] <StarsyNA> I had a knee problem a while back and my friend recommended me to go to a chiropractor and when I looked up their website it said they did something called organ manipulation where they shove on the side of your torso to get your liver in a different position or something
[2022-12-29 06:37:20] <StarsyNA> I kept looking, I recommend finding someone who works with athletes on physical therapy lol
[2022-12-29 06:37:49] <%medricx> @StarsyNA what you dont like having your organs rearranged?
[2022-12-29 06:37:59] <@%Tazny> My manager was literally just telling me about something he did like that, the look on my face WutFace
[2022-12-29 06:38:05] <StarsyNA> apparently it was developed in france

[2022-12-29 06:38:11] <Vibby_> hows the arena meta?
[2022-12-29 06:38:18] <DFOJoe> The only way I'm paying for "organ manipulation" is if it's a death knight card from the miniset and it's broken KEKW
[2022-12-29 06:38:19] VIEWERS: 318
[2022-12-29 06:38:41] <%medricx> homeopathy was also developed in france, so that's not particularly promising
[2022-12-29 06:38:54] <pepevictim> "organ manipulation?" are you applying for space marine?
[2022-12-29 06:38:56] <fabinr93> its crazy to me as an european that chiropractors can call themselves doctors in the US as thats very misleading

[2022-12-29 06:46:45] <StarsyNA> yeah they could theoretically swap out the whole core set in 4 months
[2022-12-29 06:46:51] <%Impbloody> ive thought of how they can fix hearthstone just make arena a completely different card game and let constructed be its own game
[2022-12-29 06:46:53] <%medricx> i've discovered Rin many times in Arena, yet only destroyed the deck once.

[2022-12-29 08:54:24] <camplify123> darkhawk isnt that great yet but new card synergizes with it

[2022-12-29 08:55:40] <camplify123> i used to play shadowverse and hearthstone at the same time.

[2022-12-29 08:56:25] <@%Tazny> I did it like 3 years ago, unless theyve changed anything I should be able to figure it out again
[2022-12-29 08:56:33] <camplify123> shadowversse used to be a lot like hearthstone Nowadays there's too many cards that you play them and they do like 20 different things lol
[2022-12-29 08:56:36] <%+Remster101> I think you can just go into .exe settings to allow multiple clients of a game
[2022-12-29 08:56:48] <@%Tazny> It does require you having 2 separate hearthstone accounts though I believe

[2022-12-29 09:03:11] <%Impbloody> personally i think they should have made dk way stronger and then lowered the pick selection to like 1/10000 runs so that way you could face a death knight and be like my god this class is so broken i never get it and i have played 3k runs

[2022-12-29 09:06:53] <camplify123> maybe their goal is to get everyone to stop playing arena Kappa
[2022-12-29 09:06:54] <%$mrfisher101> @cr0me1337 I think its still very viable, but after the nerfs it is more doable

[2022-12-29 09:09:38] <DFOJoe> Honestly, I think the big takeaway from me from this meta is that there IS more ways to make drafting good
[2022-12-29 09:09:57] <DFOJoe> the inherent way that death knight drafts shift depending on your rune choices should be something they find ways to implement for all the classes

[2022-12-29 09:10:24] <%+Quantum_TTV> arena should prioritize fun and than it should focus on other stuff imo, like i play arena to have fun create a good deck or a fun deck to play, for exampla last meta before this for me was full garbage, it was literally classic cards with 0 fun effect how can i have fun and chill in a meta like that

[2022-12-29 09:12:56] <%$mrfisher101> Not just because of the Colossus, but also the dredge mechanic

[2022-12-29 09:14:02] <%Impbloody> yea I feel like if you wanna monetize your game you should prioritize fun first
[2022-12-29 09:14:06] <%Veritas_12647> I think the game has just grown in a direction where they can't make a meta without it being volatile in some way.

[2022-12-29 09:14:59] <%Veritas_12647> Yeah, but unless you're going to remove all the volatile cards, you can't control it and the game becomes boring if you remove all the volatile cards.

[2022-12-29 09:16:31] <%Synastar> The game is more fun with more fun cards. Just offer more of the fun ones to the classes that are doing poorly
[2022-12-29 09:17:00] VIEWERS: 776
[2022-12-29 09:17:13] <%Veritas_12647> I consider things like a 4 mana 9/9 or a 4 mana 2/4 summon two 3/1 divine shields that can easily be played on curve too volatile. Early game massive mana cheat and individual win the game bombs like The Scourge just feel unfun to me unless every deck is so bonkers you can deal with that shit.

[2022-12-29 09:18:46] <%zeddtinn> DK is a very well designed class, it's not too weak and not op. Hats off to the developers.
[2022-12-29 09:18:53] <%Veritas_12647> I'm not against your approach, just dislike the game where you can curve out premium statted 1, 2, 3, 4 and on turn 4 be losing by like 10 mana. Mathematically it is idiotic. LUL

[2022-12-29 09:19:04] <%Impbloody> yea i think either way you look at it, the closer deck quality is the more important your decisions feel and last meta actually showed that when decks are close in power all decks feel competitive
[2022-12-29 09:19:38] <%+zeitthemonke> some frost dk have booped me
[2022-12-29 09:19:56] <%+deformedpoet> they  should start making heroes that are vaping or into crypto that have hidden links so you go to the order sites

[2022-12-29 09:20:39] <%Impbloody> right but what i mean is that if you see that low power decks perform that way then ultimately high power decks could interact the same way
