[2022-12-11 02:35:37] <%KurohanaGeist> It's... a first-person psychological thriller; that's meant to give you the feeling of... I'd say less scary, and more jarring, and into the realm of just making you on-edge, heavily.

[2022-12-11 02:37:01] <kittirine> The flying snake is a species native to Southeast Asia distinctly named for its ability to glide through forests. The Chrysopelea climbs trees through special scales on its belly, where it launches itself off from once it reaches the top.
[2022-12-11 02:37:04] <arely_v1ll> FNAF is psychologically scary to me. I think the reason why is bc horror games often make you move instead of staying in one spot
