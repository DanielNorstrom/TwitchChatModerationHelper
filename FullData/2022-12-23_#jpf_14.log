[2022-12-23 12:44:14] <%pixeled12> is boosting irl any different jay?
[2022-12-23 12:44:20] <%CrispyTunaLuis> @399g yeah like that
[2022-12-23 12:44:23] <Abi2abakaZz> Maybe like after a certain amount of contracts you get like a big mission or so

[2022-12-23 12:45:12] <%mukhtar2112> or you need to do somethings to get the boost in the first place
[2022-12-23 12:45:12] <%CrispyTunaLuis> yeah after a level you boost a rare armour truck that can be kept for a day or something
[2022-12-23 12:45:17] <%+markac99> gwg suggested the other day maybe instead of the parked cars maybe you tail a car and wait a moment to rob it
[2022-12-23 12:45:23] <%d_mavn> I'm really interested to see what they do for S++, if anything will be different

[2022-12-23 12:46:42] <!raslerja96> like you can pay more for silent boost or just do normal one @JPF_14

[2022-12-23 12:48:20] <angell89> I think there police should only be allowed to use their fast cars and Police Motor bikes for A+ or S+    apart from that standed police cars for any boost below
