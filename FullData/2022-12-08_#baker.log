[2022-12-08 00:37:57] <%+alex__gfy> deadeye is the worst at first, once you figure out how to move, thats why i hated deathblade so much at first
[2022-12-08 00:37:57] <@%^Streamlabs> because it's the best.

[2022-12-08 00:39:15] <%+alex__gfy> the only thing that worries me about deadeye is the effectiv3e range on the back attack, you literally have to be able to swipe your credit card in the bosses ass to be effective

[2022-12-08 00:40:38] <%+alex__gfy> the deadeye effective range is so small, its hella punishing like shotgun domiator will hit for 5m at a few meters away, but as soon as youre like 1 or 2m away its like 15mil

[2022-12-08 18:31:08] <@%ragingqueen666> @SyzzAMV to be honest I am just like you, but the reason I like HC in poe is that I always have like that feeling of carring and I am always alert on everything which in Softcore I just blast everything without carring. its just a different mind set to play and I like both
[2022-12-08 18:31:52] <%Renektolijus> its personal pref
[2022-12-08 18:32:02] <@%ragingqueen666> both are fun but both are different ways of feeling and playing

[2022-12-08 18:39:08] <@%+strengthie> POE has a story?
[2022-12-08 18:39:34] <%SyzzAMV> what is much better about PoE endgame than for example diablo III? I hear "maps" but it just better b/c their is more complexity so you aren't done in 2 weeks like d3?
[2022-12-08 18:39:43] <%+eousphoros> you only have to do the d4 story once, then you can skip
[2022-12-08 18:39:46] <%SyzzAMV> there*

[2022-12-08 23:55:05] <%+zeshlal> I didnt like that scrapper was so punch heavy and not very flashy, striker just flipped and kicked everything I loved that

[2022-12-08 23:56:26] <%+zeshlal> yeah it's pretty cool, wardancer is probably my least favorite, buff bot
[2022-12-08 23:57:14] <+PurpleLTV> What do you think about Z-Fighters?
[2022-12-08 23:57:27] <%+zeshlal> reason I dropped soulfist was RS seems super unfun and EO has a bullshit open up pet UI to cancel awakening thing so you can minmax

[2022-12-08 23:58:33] <%ikigami_ikigai> is the pet thing that much of a dps gain?
[2022-12-08 23:58:52] <%ikigami_ikigai> animation cancel
[2022-12-08 23:59:02] <%+zeshlal> @ikigami_ikigai you save a few seconds in hype thats only 20 secs long so i think so
