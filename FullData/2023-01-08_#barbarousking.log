[2023-01-08 04:22:52] <%atty2> Madge lastpass making me move to a new password manager because they look like they're about as competent at managing passwords as I am at playing kaizo
[2023-01-08 04:23:20] <%atty2> barbGrumpy
[2023-01-08 04:24:12] <@%$Kindredmsg> I moved from lastpass a few years ago
[2023-01-08 04:24:14] <%$alex_melted_> i don't wanna trust any password manager
[2023-01-08 04:24:47] <%atty2> i have to use a password manager. too many accounts, and all my passwords are gibberish. I guess i could keep a notebook with me or something.
[2023-01-08 04:25:15] <%atty2> Kindred what did you switch to?
[2023-01-08 04:25:42] <@%$Kindredmsg> Bitwarden. No complaints
[2023-01-08 04:26:43] <%atty2> im trying 1password because I was am hoping to get my wife and my dad to use it on a family plan, and I think they will like the onboarding and use a bit better. If it was just for me I was thinking about bitwarden.

After passing through the Slipgate, Ranger's main objective is to collect four magic runes from four dimensions of Quake; these are the key to stopping the enemy and ending the invasion of Earth."

[2023-01-08 18:18:36] <%$freya_thuriaaz> i liked them when i was younger, good times
[2023-01-08 18:18:37] <%fight_this> the serious sam games are fun but i think controller with it might not be the best
[2023-01-08 18:18:42] <%Endotoxinn> Soldier of Fortune was good
[2023-01-08 18:18:43] <Strike_the_Beat> Serious sam is a classic
[2023-01-08 18:18:46] <Sizukun1> ID made such a good engine it spawned so many good games like Quake, Rift, Chasm, Heretic/Hexen, shadow warrior, crazy
[2023-01-08 18:18:54] <Lyrent91> splat
[2023-01-08 18:18:56] <%meetreality> Honestly Serious Sam really shines in Multiplayer Coop, That would be a fun game to see you play through with someone

[2023-01-08 20:03:28] <torrancecoombs> Quake and Doom started to become kinda the same thing yeah. Quake 4 felt a lot like doom 3
[2023-01-08 20:03:29] <$PunsDeLeon> I want them to make Quake kinda medieval-ly like this one.  They jumped hard into sci-fi.
[2023-01-08 20:03:31] <%rabidwombat311> ut99 and ut2k3 were dope, but that's mp, custom maps and mods, early days

[2023-01-08 20:04:10] <%Martin_Lutter> Quake4 is a sequel to Quake2, fighting the Strogg. Quake Champions or such are based on Quake3 gameplay. there is also ajava-script browser version.

[2023-01-08 20:04:11] <ballgame27> I think it would be great if they did to Quake what they did with Doom 2016.

[2023-01-08 21:05:31] <NoobLearninGame> They could vreate a Mario World maker, so you can create your own scenario, music and world map art. And maybe release several official single player scenarios, some as DLC.

[2023-01-08 21:05:42] <%Oleai> MM was way more than a fad. It's hung around for like, 6 years? It stopped getting support because anything they could make for MM2 could go into MM3 which will actually turn a profit.
[2023-01-08 21:05:46] <%Oleai> Free patches don't make money.
[2023-01-08 21:05:50] <%JikissGamer> The expansions of Quake are great. I really like Dimension of the Machine
[2023-01-08 21:05:50] <%KOOLSM0KE> @manonfire387 sometimes that is true for sure. depending on the size and style of the game. if it is a 2nd in the series the turn around can be faster since they'd have a base game to pull from.
