[2022-12-16 22:22:23] <Rejomei> and yes, it's ducks that float in a pool <3
[2022-12-16 22:22:59] <Rejomei> I just got the newest DLC and the "more ducks" DLC :D

[2022-12-16 22:24:13] <Rejomei> That game only gives you control of the camera, so quite literally all you're doing is watching the ducks float around but this is like my... 4th-5th time I've streamed it :D
[2022-12-16 22:24:29] <Rejomei> Personally I love it
