[2022-12-22 18:17:36] <TheBigShamrock1> Mystery heros ranked would be awesome. It’s so ridiculous that you can’t actually take it that seriously, but I think the randomness makes it super fun, especially with a game with as big of a hero pool as overwatch
[2022-12-22 18:17:38] <mrhorror43> overwatch 2 hero
[2022-12-22 18:17:42] <ChristianSharkTV> Gyro controls wouldn’t effect menus @magicmoosemoo
[2022-12-22 18:17:46] <%$mustycoffee> That is some classic joycon behavior
[2022-12-22 18:17:49] <%Tijica> My joycons keep losing connection if I'm sitting a meter away from the console, not very fun

[2022-12-22 18:18:08] <@%capsNats> i don't think there's an easy fix for joycon drift

[2022-12-22 18:19:21] <$Pilhlip> @Emongg I did the same thing (played on switch) last week cuz I didnt have my PC. shockingly it used my same MMR as it did on console and it was a _reallly_ bad time LUL

[2022-12-22 18:33:50] <ChristianSharkTV> @emongg Would Sojourn still be S tier if Mercy damage boost didn’t exist?
[2022-12-22 18:33:53] <fludiddy> Since Blizzard is all about data - I would love to see the win rate when a team comp consists of a Mercy Sojourn duo.

[2022-12-22 18:34:54] <spreckles_450> The problem is obviously Mercy.  If Soj needs a mercy to be as good as she used to, then Soj is obviously nerfed.  Mercy has always made balancing certain dps troublesome

[2022-12-22 18:35:28] <%nao_ir> is this a case where they need to increase the charge cost for rail gun?

[2022-12-22 18:38:56] <stud_muffin_23> I think her rail charge needs to take a really long time to actually balance her one shot

[2022-12-22 18:39:46] <+Dorassii> wonder if they could move some of the power in railgun from damage to some sort of debuff
[2022-12-22 18:39:47] <%ChipJiggins> best way to nerf Soj is let Bastion's turret headshot again
[2022-12-22 18:39:48] <%ne0n_black> how do you nerf mercy without killing the hero
[2022-12-22 18:39:50] <+8Reverie8> What if they gave her the same recoil soldier has??? Less bullets that land, harder to charge up railgun
[2022-12-22 18:39:54] <+ginjaninja83> yeah they just need to pull rail from her altogether then
[2022-12-22 18:39:56] <%+samsquantch20> rail gun should have a cooldown
[2022-12-22 18:39:59] <+NNT97> 140 dmg but no headshot
[2022-12-22 18:39:59] <+ginjaninja83> maybe just on her ult

[2022-12-22 18:40:04] <+MrUniqueName> Ana is 50%
[2022-12-22 18:40:05] <super1mage> railgun has no cooldown, does more damage that soldier rockets and is hitscan why would you ever play any other hero
[2022-12-22 18:40:05] <%ne0n_black> sojourn is sooooo close to the cutoff dmg boost would have to do like 10%
[2022-12-22 18:40:07] <Ranrokk> What about take the headshot away from non ult railshot?

[2022-12-22 18:40:14] <ChristianSharkTV> I mean Mercy specifically
[2022-12-22 18:40:24] <+Thenorthranger> What if they reduced the fire speed of her primary so it charged slower and required more tracking aim
[2022-12-22 18:40:34] <%ne0n_black> @Rachel3107 mercy is obv the problem here KEKW
[2022-12-22 18:40:35] <Bones______> damage boost should be an ult
[2022-12-22 18:40:40] <+redhood254> What if rail gun can’t charge to 100 but when u ult it can
[2022-12-22 18:40:43] <%+diss_funk_shun> could they change how much percentage is boosted on soj specifically
[2022-12-22 18:40:45] <spreckles_450> Make damage boost a Cd, and not something that can be held forever
[2022-12-22 18:40:47] <stud_muffin_23> If damage boost is the problem Zen is fucked cause thats all he has lol
[2022-12-22 18:40:51] <+jarrhead2> the solution is nerfing rail gun if they touch mercy damage boost overall theyll become unusable
[2022-12-22 18:40:53] <%Rachel3107> It’s all mercy’s fault @ne0n_black

[2022-12-22 18:41:17] <%ne0n_black> why does rail have to headshot?
[2022-12-22 18:41:23] <%ne0n_black> symm and zar dont headshot
[2022-12-22 18:41:25] <%JustSwufty> rail gun* rail gun should be a cooldown
[2022-12-22 18:41:26] <+jarrhead2> put rail gun on a cool down and make it does do 100 dmg
[2022-12-22 18:41:30] <%+DriverSim> Maybe nerf non-ult damage boosts so that it's not awful, but not enabling broken abilities
[2022-12-22 18:41:37] <%puff4me> its clear... the answer to everyone's problem... nerf genji duh

[2022-12-22 18:42:16] <%ne0n_black> making rail not headshot also nerfs more for higher elo than mid elo
[2022-12-22 18:42:18] <%blondejohn96> zoned like a boss
[2022-12-22 18:42:27] <+Thenorthranger> They need to decide if SJ should be a close range or long range dps, because at this point there is no distance where Sj isnt the best choice
[2022-12-22 18:42:27] <ChristianSharkTV> Rail gun I think they wanna keep the sniper shot because it’s a part of the hero’s core design.

[2022-12-22 18:44:00] <spreckles_450> @ne0n_black Widow shots are stronger than sojourn railgun and dont require to charge to 100 to do max damage.  So why is railgun a problem, when it's all around weaker than widow? monkaHmm

[2022-12-22 18:44:35] <%ne0n_black> @spreckles_450 because widow doesnt have an insane unscoped primary fire (which does absolutely have a charge time) or a 7 sec superslide and jump
[2022-12-22 18:44:35] <+Thenorthranger> @spreckles_450 Because SJ can 1 shot while full speed strafing
[2022-12-22 18:44:38] <ChristianSharkTV> @kidritch Gyro controls are a decent sub for mouse & keyboard. 30 fps is more of a adjustment

[2022-12-22 18:50:32] <emeraldplums> @bebader what does tempo tank means?
[2022-12-22 18:50:32] <%+jonah_ward> it seems that their plan of putting the opposing players on the same role as you within the same rank has been working so far, at least in my plat lobbies
[2022-12-22 18:50:33] <spreckles_450> But yeah, people have short memories.  A few years ago, people were complaining just as much about Ashe + Mercy as they are now about Soj + Mercy.  it's almost like Mercy damage boost is teh real problem LuL

[2022-12-22 18:51:20] <emeraldplums> What does tempo tank means?
[2022-12-22 18:51:32] <%blondejohn96> it means a tank that drives a 1995 ford tempo
[2022-12-22 18:51:33] <%$wacko721> @emeraldplums It can keep a beat.

[2022-12-22 18:52:49] <goofyahjame> So
[2022-12-22 18:52:54] <speakr4theded> @emeraldplums Tempo refers to the pace of the game. If the game is going slow you have a tank playing defense. If the tempo needs increased the tank becomes aggressive.

[2022-12-22 19:07:11] <%ne0n_black> they should buff zar charge falloff to make up for bubble uptime nerf

[2022-12-22 19:18:57] <Cucumbered_> @ne0n_black is Lucios speed boost actually long enough to outrun it with just 5% faster movement than him?
[2022-12-22 19:18:59] <+felds> ram ult will be op once people discover its synergies and strengths
[2022-12-22 19:19:04] <speakr4theded> @Emongg In low ranks it's hard to get people to even use an ult that it took them almost 4 minutes to build

[2022-12-22 19:20:15] <%ReuelerLB> @n3rdzillaa it’s either get out of the circle or kill him. Low ranks don’t work together to do either of those and that’s the issue
[2022-12-22 19:20:41] <%ne0n_black> @ne0n_black + lucio boop yeah. At least it feels decent so far

[2022-12-22 19:21:53] <%ne0n_black> but like enemy ram can also have a lucio soooo
[2022-12-22 19:21:59] <%ne0n_black> it depends?
[2022-12-22 19:22:10] <Cucumbered_> yeah, with amp it's obviously enough, but it's on a fairly sizable CD, and enemy lucio makes it trick yea

[2022-12-22 20:27:55] <@%^StreamElements> Llileas, Emongg's ult is on numpad4 because he plays with arrow keys. He does not play left handed. The reason the other abilities say E and Shift is because they are double bound.

[2022-12-22 21:16:45] <+aaymon86> It counters alot of heroes and empowers Hog alot.  Removing cleanse might help with balancing.  Just my 2 cents.

[2022-12-22 21:23:52] <spreckles_450> @spreckles_450 Brig got like 4 buffs in a row after she was released.  Other than right now, she was at her weakest on release.

[2022-12-22 21:25:44] <+Desagono> You probably need an ana to bait the suzu out otherwise kiriko will never use it
[2022-12-22 21:25:45] <certainly_not_a_robot> @aaymon86 or invincibility
[2022-12-22 21:25:53] <spreckles_450> maybe im misremembering after her rework then, 6 years of OW muddles together
[2022-12-22 21:26:02] <+Bob_dud3> Is there a clip of that cleanse?

[2022-12-22 21:26:08] <%ne0n_black> is the guy talking about brig buffs refering to the state of brig on launch of OW2? Cause im talking about when she released in OW1

[2022-12-22 21:26:41] <%7thSea> @russwestbot, is this memes alt acct?
[2022-12-22 21:26:46] <%ne0n_black> kiriko is meta warping/defining
[2022-12-22 21:26:47] <Jonapwns> junker queen needs some buffs, her kit is fun but not self sufficient enough to keep her alive :(
[2022-12-22 21:26:48] <ChristianSharkTV> TLDR they made her super powerful to discourage Tracer & Genji from just assassinating supports instantly but the things that enabled that also created a very annoying meta that everyone hated
[2022-12-22 21:26:52] <+aaymon86> tbh, I think the cleanse part that really sucks.
[2022-12-22 21:26:54] <%+jsapphire6> Brig could beat a tracer and the tracer could nothing about it
[2022-12-22 21:27:05] <bakush> Brig has never been meta, I have no memories of it :)
[2022-12-22 21:27:08] <spreckles_450> @spreckles_450 Comparable with bap, maybe.  But kiriko isn't instakilling flankers with  bash + melee + flail combos

[2022-12-22 21:31:45] <spreckles_450> @spreckles_450 I mean, JQ's two biggest tank counters are Zarya and Hog, and like you said, Suzu already empowers hog, so the two combined make it an almost impossible matchup

[2022-12-22 21:34:52] <spreckles_450> Suzu just needs to only cleanse if they have an affliction, otherwise give the invuln.  Not both.
