[2023-01-06 18:56:16] <%+TheSilvertine> people tell me that SAM is hard and I want to know what game they are playing
[2023-01-06 18:56:36] <%triomino_guy> i think some people just find different things difficult
[2023-01-06 18:56:39] <+herosnax> If every class plays the same, then they should just call the classes 'Warrior of Damage' 'Warrior of Tank' 'Warrior of Heal' and 'Warrior of Magic'. xD
[2023-01-06 18:56:42] <%Keld__> third eye optimization is atleast cool
[2023-01-06 18:56:44] <%krunchi7> Make bard a full dot spec :p
[2023-01-06 18:56:48] <%TheKo0ts> if you play anime intros while playing SAM you get a 50% dmg buff
[2023-01-06 18:57:23] <%yueshiroi> I think they're removing dots
[2023-01-06 18:57:23] <%Keld__> play bleach, samurai champloo, one piece, or ruroni kenshin theme while playing SAM for 100%
[2023-01-06 18:57:30] <%yueshiroi> like possibly just completely removed
[2023-01-06 18:57:33] <%yueshiroi> yeah
[2023-01-06 18:57:40] <%yueshiroi> PLD losing theirs now as well

[2023-01-06 18:57:58] <%Keld__> from bard is a dot based job to dots are buttonbloat on bard

[2023-01-06 18:58:24] <%TheKo0ts> I mean... the design of PLD was going against the design of the 2 min meta FeelsDankMan

[2023-01-06 18:58:33] <%ClumsyOcelot> I remember back in TEA there was an optimization on MCH where you would use Flamethrower on BJ/CC for a dps gain NotLikeThis  only thing it's useful for
