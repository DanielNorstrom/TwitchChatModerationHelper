[2023-01-02 16:19:03] <stighannson> Brah tft has been out for 4 years and it’s still under resourced on the same shitty client and they can’t do independent updates when shits not balanced
[2023-01-02 16:19:10] <WERTZAO> valorant and wild rift together wont ever come close to league alone

[2023-01-02 16:20:13] <+the_godfrog> i don't think they've committed to a year yet
[2023-01-02 16:20:20] <+sehten> @stighannson that's because tft doesn't make money. that's why we're seeing the changes to monetization within it for the lil legends and everything
[2023-01-02 16:20:21] <%+Lafabreezy> 2024 likely
[2023-01-02 16:20:27] <Edmonster68> @jakeothecheese i always describe it to my friends as high speed chess with no limit on how many moves you can make

[2023-01-02 17:53:04] <+ArchToches> @stonesour26 I mean, he could get away with being manaless, and his R essentially "does" make him manaless, but it's probably to keep him in check in the early game
