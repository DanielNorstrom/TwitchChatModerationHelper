[2022-12-09 03:22:32] <@%^Streamlabs> TeeP enjoys the core gameplay of WZ 2.0. Loves the look and feel of the map. TeeP prefers free loadout to be during 1st circle and more money economy on the map. Hitching/Lagging is an issue as well. TeeP loves the game so far and looks forward to quality of life improvements. TeeP does not know what the exact meta will be for the game, but the meta will probably evolve quickly as it did for WZ 1. TeeP will be using a variety of loadouts. - !guns for more info

[2022-12-09 15:43:20] <@%^Streamlabs> TeeP enjoys the core gameplay of WZ 2.0. Loves the look and feel of the map. TeeP prefers free loadout to be during 1st circle and more money economy on the map. Hitching/Lagging is an issue as well. TeeP loves the game so far and looks forward to quality of life improvements. TeeP does not know what the exact meta will be for the game, but the meta will probably evolve quickly as it did for WZ 1. TeeP will be using a variety of loadouts. - !guns for more info

[2022-12-09 16:33:31] <%deputydog803> if they did where you could buy perks I say 2500 a perk at the buy so you can choose between perks or guns or perks and guns if you have enough money for both

[2022-12-09 16:33:49] <$oAngelzz> Teep til they put in buyable perks and you realizes after a month that they dont actually give you the perk because of a "bug"

[2022-12-09 16:33:59] <+DaFloppyOne> I could be wrong but if they rework the gun levelling/attachments so it‚Äôs like a normal levelling system, they would probably get a more consistent player base symfPray
