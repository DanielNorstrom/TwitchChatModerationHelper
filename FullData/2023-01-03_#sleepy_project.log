[2023-01-03 00:00:05] <%Rappolt> Too many buttons to go on console

[2023-01-03 00:00:28] <HiberniaScholar> There is a new quest to kill 10 scavs on each map with melee only
[2023-01-03 00:00:29] <KingAnura> Only found them on scav with no backpack sleepyproReeFree2
[2023-01-03 00:00:31] <thunderaiden56> Good luck to you as well
[2023-01-03 00:00:38] <!%Kirsche> EEPY have you had items go missing in your stash kirscheHuh
[2023-01-03 00:00:51] <+SecretAgentPickles> THE WENDIGO IS LOOSE
[2023-01-03 00:00:52] <red_tips> can you imagine takov with aim assis?t
[2023-01-03 00:00:54] <DHokat> i think they said they would like to if they could make the controls work
[2023-01-03 00:00:59] <DHokat> but not till release
[2023-01-03 00:01:04] <DHokat> and that won't be for a long time

[2023-01-03 00:01:46] <andrios1> tarkov on steam deck
[2023-01-03 00:01:55] <gameralicorn42> don't speak of the aim assust heresy
[2023-01-03 00:01:59] <%kurarindesu> dont even know howd you clear jams
[2023-01-03 00:02:12] <!%Kirsche> I had a car battery inside a pillbox, and i went to rearrange some stuff and its just whole ass gone PepePls
[2023-01-03 00:02:17] <andrios1> jilly should play tarkov on his steam deck

[2023-01-03 00:02:20] <+ContentedLie> Tarkov on Nintendo Wii.
[2023-01-03 00:02:21] <%Zephyr1O2> hence why crossplay would suck so hard
[2023-01-03 00:02:25] <DHokat> i would guess the only way to play with controller if it was a pro controller with al the extra paddles plus some foot controls

[2023-01-03 00:02:34] <%+Plasmodesta> fuckin fighting game length combo to clean a jam smh
[2023-01-03 00:02:34] <%jasondreams37> does tarkov update a lot? that's always a pain with console certification
[2023-01-03 00:02:36] <!%Kirsche> thanks traders
[2023-01-03 00:02:45] <%Rappolt> Console can use mouse and keyboard. They don't get controller compensation
[2023-01-03 00:02:45] <%+Plasmodesta> console would be insane
[2023-01-03 00:02:46] <+SecretAgentPickles> Wii would like to raid
[2023-01-03 00:02:49] <KingAnura> I've had issues moving pillboxes specifically, in and out of backpacks
[2023-01-03 00:02:49] <%Zephyr1O2> the good M+KB players would wreck the aim-assist guys, but aim-assist would wreck us scrubs
[2023-01-03 00:02:52] <MrGoodkatGaming> aim assist doesn't really make sense in tarkov anywat
[2023-01-03 00:03:00] <%baz_exe> I remember that, it happened to me
[2023-01-03 00:03:00] <%FrailSheep> Happy New Year everyone ! sleepyproWiggle

[2023-01-03 00:03:28] <gameralicorn42> Tarkov VR is more likely to happen before console probably
[2023-01-03 00:03:28] <phantomlazarz> Nikita is that generous to give out aim assit

[2023-01-03 00:04:00] <!%Kirsche> this game has issues on PC and we havent gotten audio fixes in over a year, who tf wants this to console
[2023-01-03 00:04:11] <+lynema> @phantomlazarz Id expect him to intentionally make the console controls worse
[2023-01-03 00:04:16] <ashen_deity> Greetings mortals, did you know itâ€™s illegal for a man with a mustache to kiss a girl in public in Iowa?

[2023-01-03 00:04:48] <+yeeter_of_bruhs> id like to play tarkov on my 3ds
[2023-01-03 00:04:51] <%Rappolt> Imagine if they acknowledged these issues and they gave us a menu or even a quick reconnect button
[2023-01-03 00:04:51] <DHokat> just download more ram SeemsGood
[2023-01-03 00:04:53] <KingAnura> Would still work better than modern triple A releases tbh

[2023-01-03 00:05:06] <ph0sphorus7> It would be even worse. Xbox game pass. Then play with cloud gaming.

[2023-01-03 00:05:25] <+Nootkatensis> they just put new audio in this wipe @kirsche not any better though

[2023-01-03 01:34:33] <%TimTamTanny> It's because there's 480p 30fps evidence of you saying you hate chat. If you didnt say you hate chat, the game wouldnt hate you sleepyproSmug2

[2023-01-03 01:35:27] <gameralicorn42> they probably have the raid system set up like that in order to prevent large streamers from just helping other people they know get big artificially
[2023-01-03 01:35:28] <PossiblyAGecko> bruhhh I got 30 rounds for my legendary
[2023-01-03 01:35:40] <@%$jilly_mod> that sure was an intense offline raid
[2023-01-03 01:35:43] <%+aer0wlng> since you're lv15 now so just selling something before end the stream?

[2023-01-03 01:36:24] <@%+ParanoidCorgi> you have to refresh for it to reset the drops counter its weird?
[2023-01-03 01:36:25] <%Astropigey> What typically is the difference between a common, rare, and legendary drop?>

[2023-01-03 01:40:30] <+mrlockets> 12 hours and 5 drops later I think this has been a pretty positive experience
[2023-01-03 01:40:36] <LeoSiegfried> i have played rust heard its alot like that
[2023-01-03 01:40:51] <gameralicorn42> keep that ledx
[2023-01-03 01:40:55] <+KendersGame> tmj is a bitch sometimes
[2023-01-03 01:40:58] <+veradux12> @AransPancakes depends if you want to wait for the price to go up to like 1.2m
[2023-01-03 01:40:59] <%TimTamTanny> EEPERS I TAKE BACK EVERY MEAN THING I SAID ABOUT YOU
[2023-01-03 01:41:02] <CurlEBrace> 700k is like, end-of-wipe price for a LEDX
[2023-01-03 01:41:03] <%Mriggyoggy> has 12hrs of tarkov sent you mad yet?
[2023-01-03 01:41:05] <%TimTamTanny> 2 grizzlies from my rare drop
[2023-01-03 01:41:15] <%+gdj156> Yee Yee
[2023-01-03 01:41:18] <%Rappolt> @CurlEBrace No, they get down to 300-400k
[2023-01-03 01:41:23] <CurlEBrace> at this stage you want at least a million for it, or yeah keep it
[2023-01-03 01:41:29] <LeoSiegfried> when do drops end  in 20 min?

[2023-01-03 01:41:36] <%Astropigey> Damn the time moves FAST lol
[2023-01-03 01:41:37] <%Rappolt> The fees were raised, so you probably can't sell a LEDX for 1.2m anymore
[2023-01-03 01:41:41] <phantomlazarz> Iâ€™d say that itâ€™s more similar to dayz and stalker
[2023-01-03 01:41:56] <AransPancakes> I mean, turning it in in 20 levels.
[2023-01-03 01:42:01] <+Syntheticpilot> <3
[2023-01-03 01:42:01] <CurlEBrace> i think we're learning you should probably just hang on to the LEDX if it's your only one
