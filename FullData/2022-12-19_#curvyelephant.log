[2022-12-19 15:55:14] <el_presidente072> I refuse to ride with her, on principle
[2022-12-19 15:55:22] <$realrickystinks> in my Camaro everyone thinks my brights are on, but trust me.. it can get brighter :)
[2022-12-19 15:55:31] <@%nmussa> @el_presidente072 Doesn't she get pulled over?
[2022-12-19 15:55:43] <laetuss> yeah, they're bright as fuck
[2022-12-19 15:56:15] <el_presidente072> Nope, she nevers wears a seatbelt either. I once sat parked 5 minutes waiting for her to put it on before I drove away

[2022-12-19 15:58:18] <SwerbianTV> rear fog lights are required by law in Sweden I believe
[2022-12-19 15:58:35] <@%nmussa> I've never heard about it here either
[2022-12-19 15:58:42] <@%nmussa> But then again, we don't live out in the desert
[2022-12-19 15:58:57] <laetuss> having the rear lights double as indicators is the most fucked up thing in the world.

[2022-12-19 16:00:23] <@%nmussa> Not using an indicator to say when you're pulling out is so fucking rude
