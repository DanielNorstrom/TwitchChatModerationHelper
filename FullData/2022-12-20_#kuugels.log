[2022-12-20 12:44:29] <@%+rallen1122> then you probably want a normal fs routine with reblath, boss gear and blackstars. you stack normally to 110ish without valks, then fail pen reblath to 140-150ish, then try tet BS to like 200 max 210, then fail normal boss gear to like 240-250, after that raw tap pen bs if you still wanna go higher. 180fs would be where you cron tri fg and 240fs where you make pen bs, tet fg or cheap pen accs (all except disto,dawn or debos)
