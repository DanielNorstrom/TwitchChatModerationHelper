[2022-12-29 20:41:40] <fapdawg> to be fair, there are lots of viable decks outside of top 100. Top 100 is the only place where "only Combo is viable" holds true

[2022-12-29 21:29:37] <!%+shanevapid> I watch Hearthstone on Twitch because I take delight in others' misery, not because I care
[2022-12-29 21:30:12] <sonofman1930> Yes its funny to see people rage over a children's card game. It brings me joy and it
[2022-12-29 21:30:13] <@%tictac_hs> Legit control warrior is in a decent spot rn @MeatiHS
[2022-12-29 21:30:14] <Manja9070> but is not, is a complex deck
[2022-12-29 21:30:15] <sonofman1930> funny
[2022-12-29 21:30:21] <+the_high_groundd> frost dk is falling apart
[2022-12-29 21:30:23] <@%pocket_train> You used to play Boon Priest in the meta you liked, that deck is still busted
[2022-12-29 21:30:27] <BakedZnake> isnt meati playing a deck that only has 3 spells?
[2022-12-29 21:30:42] <+frankplayshs> they unoriginally call it a children's card game yet I never see children playing it
[2022-12-29 21:30:46] <%+FluxxyKarmah> it just sucks that you see like 3 classes on ladder
[2022-12-29 21:30:51] <%+FluxxyKarmah> no variety
[2022-12-29 21:31:08] <Blaze919191> I beat norwis with spitter hunter, boon priest is not busted
[2022-12-29 21:31:09] <Vengeance_88> @FluxxyKarmah You see all the classes thx to maestra Kappa
[2022-12-29 21:31:11] <houndoo95> @frankplayshs imagine a child that play miracle rogue
[2022-12-29 21:31:11] <BakedZnake> @FluxxyKarmah that's a lie, rogue has a card that allows many classes on ladder 5Head
[2022-12-29 21:31:12] VIEWERS: 987
[2022-12-29 21:31:14] <sonofman1930> This game was designed for children I think it's like Yugioh.
[2022-12-29 21:31:20] <+frankplayshs> mhmm
[2022-12-29 21:31:22] <%+FluxxyKarmah> @Vengeance_88 so true

[2022-12-29 21:31:33] <AoD7> before the renathal nerf I think every class was being played bad or not except warrior which is trash for a whole year
[2022-12-29 21:31:34] <+datfrogger> Miracle rogue is super fun
[2022-12-29 21:31:35] <@%pocket_train> @Blaze919191 See, I can tell you're lying because no one beats Norwis
[2022-12-29 21:31:40] <!%+shanevapid> @frankplayshs hang out around playgrounds with binoculars, surely you'll spot some children playing hearthstone

[2022-12-29 21:32:01] <sonofman1930> I remember meati use to have a Shaman deck. Now Shaman is good and he doesn't play it.
[2022-12-29 21:32:03] <+frankplayshs> LOL Shane. that'd be a funny one to explain to the cops
[2022-12-29 21:32:09] <BakedZnake> @Blaze919191 Norwis isnt no 1 on EU is he?
[2022-12-29 21:32:13] <+YoHablo_Espanol> the renathal nerf really killed the variety whether you liked it or not
[2022-12-29 21:32:20] <Blaze919191> he is like 200 eu KEKL
[2022-12-29 21:32:24] <%rexmkh> @Blaze919191 Nrowis is 1 on two servers at the moment
[2022-12-29 21:32:29] <Vengeance_88> @shanevapid I could also see a cop playing hearthstone as well
[2022-12-29 21:32:32] <+the_high_groundd> its crazy how much higher hearthstones skill cap has gotten over the years
[2022-12-29 21:32:35] <IcyMcSp1cy> how have these pelicans pushed 12 damage KEKL
[2022-12-29 21:32:39] <AoD7> I think renathal nerf wasn't needed since they nerfed Denathrius and killed theotar
[2022-12-29 21:32:40] <BakedZnake> EU the only hard mode

[2022-12-29 22:45:17] <%SoapyHS> dude this DH deck might be one of the absolute worst tier1s to date
[2022-12-29 22:45:27] <%+snaktray> you need spells to charge the steno and then play then steno and then have more spells to get the steno to attack. seems like worse abusive seargent
[2022-12-29 22:45:28] <%SoapyHS> it's absolutely unbearable to both watch and play
[2022-12-29 22:45:32] <@%Tinyfred> Control warrior being T1 was worse
