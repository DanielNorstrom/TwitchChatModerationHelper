[2022-12-23 15:52:03] <%AwareWolf6> @ayowhaddup i mean i could see this if youre overweight, but even if youre overweigh, putting yourself in a caloric deficit is kinda not as good as you think, if youre lifting weights the goal is to build muscle, not burn fat. if youre eating the correct amount of protein your body will adjust overtime no matter what.
[2022-12-23 15:52:07] <+RemarkableSeiF> The new body positivity bullshit is just a bunch of fat people trying to normalise it as ok.

[2022-12-23 15:55:35] <@%+TheKoni> if you arent ofver 50-55 and over 280-300, you can find ways to cut calories and just be MORE active than you currently are. just STANDING during the day instead of sitting is HUGE

[2022-12-23 15:55:40] <%AwareWolf6> @ayowhaddup yes but, the noob gains will wear off, i was a person trainer for 5 years. you have to want to be strong and successful. This is the same reason that so many ppl fail weight loss
[2022-12-23 15:55:51] <+poshleyheights> not everybody does well with tough love sometimes it just takes a mental click i think
[2022-12-23 15:55:57] <rhubarbdedubarb> @UncleVictory see how many calories your eating a day and if your getting fatter at that then your maintain is less, as a 5ft6 male mine is like 2000 if that gives restuarant

[2022-12-23 16:24:14] <%zizoi2> Creatine is a natural substance that turns into creatine phosphate in the body. Creatine phosphate helps make a substance called adenosine triphosphate (ATP). ATP provides the energy for muscle contractions. The body produces some of the creatine it uses
[2022-12-23 16:24:15] <%$itsdaveygravy> ALL THAT MEANS IS YOUR RETAIN MORE FLUID and recover faster
[2022-12-23 16:24:17] <+ajwiwnl> we talking about creatine?
[2022-12-23 16:24:24] <SuperSmashBroski> simple science, it slows down fatigue
[2022-12-23 16:24:26] <%$itsdaveygravy> when you stop you drop X amount of pounds in a week
[2022-12-23 16:24:28] <ganiccus> you know what adds water weight too? carbs.
[2022-12-23 16:24:34] <LifeEvanescent> I agree with Lasik surgery being one of the best investments you could make. You don't realize how much having to wear glasses dominates your life until you don't need them.

[2022-12-23 16:25:31] <%+AtomicStalin> @th4third there is no amount of creatine you can reasonably take that would be bad for you. you could take 50g a day and it woudln't hurt you
