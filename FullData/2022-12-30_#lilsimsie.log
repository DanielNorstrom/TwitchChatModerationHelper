Please don't make a big deal about it or guilt her in chat. It's really upsetting to have people complaining all day when we're just trying to have fun. She has TONS of Sims content on YouTube, and we'll play The Sims again later this week.

[2022-12-30 00:50:11] <roseyduckling> It is somehow even more fun than I thought it would be and it already looked super fun
[2022-12-30 00:50:12] <little_miss_anxiety> the map is a little annoying on the switch bc it isnt as fast to move around or click on things

[2022-12-30 00:50:34] <+evie12_> Not on sale though for Mac which is sad :(
[2022-12-30 00:50:46] <topazure_> I have never played this game but have seen lots about it. Would you say its worth getting?
[2022-12-30 00:50:51] <@%+MrsTomato101814> @artistsinlove not with playstation, but between the other platforms yes
[2022-12-30 00:50:52] <%42hitch42> @artistsinlove you have to purchase it separately for different platforms, but once you do you can use the same save on both
[2022-12-30 00:50:56] <%Star_House> I got gamepass to play slime rancher 2 and ended up playing this game more lol

[2022-12-30 00:52:18] <probably_kourtni> @mamabear171921 I think that‚Äôs the only one it‚Äôs not super glitchy on!!! I think it‚Äôs because it is in line with PC!
[2022-12-30 00:52:20] <%$bekahmreed> It was about an hour for me
[2022-12-30 00:52:33] <+XtraCheezPlz_> @clari_nlsn If you aren't on PC I've heard many complaints about crashes and glitches (especially Switch) so I would maybe wait for until it's free if those things are a concern from you. Personally I've spent 150h on the game and bought the more expensive version and would say it's worth it.
[2022-12-30 00:52:36] <mamabear171921> @probably_kourtni ooh that would make sense!
[2022-12-30 00:52:38] <%+Groundhog89> is she playing standard deluxe or ultimate edition?
[2022-12-30 00:52:42] <triniipini> @lenabena19 yeah! i play it on pc but with a controller, bc for me its more comfortable
