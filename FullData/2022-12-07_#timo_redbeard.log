[2022-12-07 17:54:52] <%$KaerieP> Clearly, not giving us worked stone textures is just an oversight.
[2022-12-07 17:55:47] <%freshprince925> It's either an oversight or intentional to draw more players for a future "smaller" update

[2022-12-07 17:58:20] <%GoKartM0zart> They DID add a lot of pieces... geez people  :)
[2022-12-07 17:58:42] <%freshprince925> the game should evolve with it's players....

[2022-12-07 18:00:36] <Saintgein> It just bad that the normal triangle parts can't be done downwards.
[2022-12-07 18:00:46] <NotEtril> damn
[2022-12-07 18:01:25] <Saintgein> No the ones upward.
[2022-12-07 18:01:32] <Saintgein> The small ones.
[2022-12-07 18:01:44] <Prophet_FMJ> Was contemplating jumping on Valheim to check out the Mistlands. How have you found them?

[2022-12-07 18:02:18] <NotEtril> only reason would be triangulated rooms for whatever reason i think
[2022-12-07 18:02:34] <%freshprince925> adds an extra snap point I guess
[2022-12-07 18:02:40] <%reacshuns> make the entire floor diagnal on the inside of walls with that triangle pieces, idk if that makes sense it does in my mind
[2022-12-07 18:02:40] <%+weed00420> snap the gray to the angle maybe
[2022-12-07 18:02:43] <%AZAAD__> so true
[2022-12-07 18:02:49] <Prophet_FMJ> 15 wow, is that whats its been..lol
[2022-12-07 18:02:56] <%AZAAD__> great for combat playing.. but pita for building a base on
[2022-12-07 18:03:09] <Saintgein> I mean the standing up small triangle.
[2022-12-07 18:03:21] <Saintgein> That one should be downwards too.
[2022-12-07 18:03:40] <Saintgein> Yes.
[2022-12-07 18:03:51] <%freshprince925> That would have solved your issue on the circle walls

[2022-12-07 18:04:07] <Saintgein> The rest is upside down.
[2022-12-07 18:04:08] <%$KaerieP> I don't see a use for the triangle pieces the way you were using them just now, but you could use them to fill in a diamond pattern in the floor.
[2022-12-07 18:04:50] <Saintgein> I went all out with the new stuff, you can see it on the discord.
[2022-12-07 18:05:04] <Saintgein> It's just this thing that bothered me.

[2022-12-07 18:08:12] <NotEtril> is this a test character, or do we only test building?
[2022-12-07 18:08:32] <%rieljudoka> @TheBeaverMan I'd say it is a rather constructive stream
[2022-12-07 18:08:37] <+AntlerCarver> I'm still working on playing with the new pieces too.
