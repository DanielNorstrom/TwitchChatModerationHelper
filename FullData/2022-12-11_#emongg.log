[2022-12-11 00:18:34] <@%^StreamElements> If you're noticing ads at unfortunate times, Twitch now requires all streams to run ads at set intervals. We're not triggering them, they're on Twitch's end and out of our control.

[2022-12-11 01:02:24] <%Scytal_> the botanist skin fits well the greek mythology theme
[2022-12-11 01:02:38] <mcmuscles086> When exactly are you supposed to zoom in with Ana?

[2022-12-11 01:03:19] <$tf2dove> hitscan also has a tracer line, so if you want to be subtle on where your teammate is you can intentionally use hipfire
[2022-12-11 01:03:39] <BoringKeys> no scope for stealth mode
[2022-12-11 01:03:51] <Niteblooded> projectile is also a faster fire rate
