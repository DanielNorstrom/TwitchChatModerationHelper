[2022-12-10 13:05:04] <+mllfconnoisseur> rein will out damage the ramattra first
[2022-12-10 13:05:04] <%+Skar_> @soma_af same I love cold but getting out of bed and getting hit right away with low temp hits hard OMEGALUL
[2022-12-10 13:05:04] <uhsuppies> i was gonna say the clear problem is roadhog
[2022-12-10 13:05:21] <%354hamtaro> it's like 12 punches to kill Rein
[2022-12-10 13:05:34] <%354hamtaro> 13, i was close
[2022-12-10 13:05:39] <%Luckball_123> can u hit multi targets with punch?
[2022-12-10 13:05:48] <krokusmelker> @Luckball_123 YES
[2022-12-10 13:05:52] <%soma_af> @Skar_ OH yea it really does LUL i hope you feel warmer soon lhcloudyLove
[2022-12-10 13:06:01] <tubigdomoo> hog can 3 shot rein
[2022-12-10 13:06:01] <%354hamtaro> @Luckball_123 Yes, it goes thru enemies and barriers, including DM
[2022-12-10 13:06:07] <%Austriansamurai1> but he can pUnCh ThRoUgH ShIeLd
[2022-12-10 13:06:07] <+mllfconnoisseur> ramattra is a fun hero not very comp imo
[2022-12-10 13:06:08] <%Luckball_123> oh shit
[2022-12-10 13:06:09] <%Luckball_123> ty
[2022-12-10 13:06:14] <uhsuppies> ramattra feels unplayable against like half the tanks in the game
[2022-12-10 13:06:15] <%+Skar_> @soma_af lhcloudyLove
[2022-12-10 13:06:22] <%GIRLinMaleBody> u can kill 5 reins in 1 use of nemesis form, assuming they dont get heal or attack u Clueless
[2022-12-10 13:06:22] <%Luckball_123> but like
[2022-12-10 13:06:26] <%Luckball_123> NO MOVEMENT
[2022-12-10 13:06:27] <%354hamtaro> His ult callout is fucking METAL though
[2022-12-10 13:06:32] <atte55> are you trying to get back to owl?
[2022-12-10 13:06:39] <tokekberacun> everytime the enemy picked ramattra i always hard gapped them lol
[2022-12-10 13:06:53] <%Austriansamurai1> doom is soooo annoying rn
[2022-12-10 13:07:02] <%xPokesterx> I own rams on hog but hog is just strong atm
[2022-12-10 13:07:11] <aboomer26> feel like his playstyle similar to Doomfist, go for the back line?
[2022-12-10 13:07:14] <%GIRLinMaleBody> i take bastion and shoot doom all the time
[2022-12-10 13:07:23] <%354hamtaro> I feel like his shield CD is a bit too long at 14 sec
[2022-12-10 13:07:25] <waduupbaby> dps that counter doom?
[2022-12-10 13:07:27] <%354hamtaro> could be like 12 imo
[2022-12-10 13:07:29] <kingalba95> are you gonna create a new smurf for only ram or keep this one?
[2022-12-10 13:07:33] <%highly23> Don’t worry they’ll nerf doom and roadhog in season 3
[2022-12-10 13:07:45] <generalvonroom> @waduupbaby echo rly good into him
[2022-12-10 13:07:45] <%xPokesterx> sombra is ok but doom just op atm imo
[2022-12-10 13:07:46] <%+Skar_> Did you bet today for ingerland game
[2022-12-10 13:08:03] <%354hamtaro> @waduupbaby Tracer
[2022-12-10 13:08:09] <%WinstonsNK> huge day of football yesterday
[2022-12-10 13:08:10] <uhsuppies> the doom buffs were so odd they just went against all the anti cc shit they kinda committed to going into ow2
[2022-12-10 13:08:13] <%JuunasWasTaken> this meta has such annoying heroes to deal with
[2022-12-10 13:08:17] <+zenostortoise_> Patches? They're working on the S3 skins guys
[2022-12-10 13:08:17] <%354hamtaro> Brazil chipsaKEK
[2022-12-10 13:08:19] <aboomer26> Croatia all the way
[2022-12-10 13:08:23] <%mrgreenlantern69> doom isn't op you just can't aim KEKW
[2022-12-10 13:08:24] <mawningcoffee> van gaal was talking shit
[2022-12-10 13:08:39] <jjjcicivib> unlucky
[2022-12-10 13:08:44] <%+Skar_> nah croatia is gonna do like 2018 win in penalties every single time and get elimited on final
[2022-12-10 13:09:02] <%354hamtaro> @mrgreenlantern69 yea Doom is *good* but probably not OP
[2022-12-10 13:09:05] <%JuunasWasTaken> they should just start blasting experimental patches
[2022-12-10 13:09:06] <%GIRLinMaleBody> sojourn not nerfed at all
[2022-12-10 13:09:22] <%xPokesterx> I think hog would benefit from a rework
[2022-12-10 13:09:25] <%GIRLinMaleBody> and orisa
[2022-12-10 13:09:45] <%+Skar_> tracer doesn't need shield 👍
[2022-12-10 13:09:48] <appelystreet> do they need to nerf hog? isn't kiriko the issue?
[2022-12-10 13:09:48] <%354hamtaro> LUL
[2022-12-10 13:09:49] <+Liquid_N> yesterday i played in a top 500 lobby as hog i didnt feed my brains out and my team kept dying to a widow all game for teh record im a plat player
[2022-12-10 13:09:58] <tokekberacun> suuuuurely he will use his shield
[2022-12-10 13:09:58] <gcgamingvariety> how about the new Hero, like the AoE on his Ult is insane with that DoT >.>
[2022-12-10 13:10:02] <%GIRLinMaleBody> kiriko will be in the game forever
[2022-12-10 13:10:13] <%GIRLinMaleBody> so the only solution is make hog unplayable without her
[2022-12-10 13:10:19] <%354hamtaro> add 2 seconds more cooldown to Hog's abilities or some shit
[2022-12-10 13:10:22] <%soma_af> what's the cd for cleanse now?
[2022-12-10 13:10:25] <%GIRLinMaleBody> 13
[2022-12-10 13:10:28] <atte55> i actually kind of hope they dont nerf doom, he was unplayable for so long i actually want to see hih for a while
[2022-12-10 13:10:28] <%+Skar_> @gcgamingvariety nah It's really bad, just LOS his ult, he losses instantly and he is really weak even in ult
[2022-12-10 13:10:38] <%354hamtaro> xqcL
[2022-12-10 13:10:54] <aboomer26> neft kiriko's kunai man oneshot my ass from 100ft away with no sound :(
[2022-12-10 13:10:55] <%mrgreenlantern69> I agree, I've been waiting for another doom meta since his release.  all you noobs can cry now NODDERS
[2022-12-10 13:11:05] <%GIRLinMaleBody> make dmg reduction lower, without any reduction he will actually die before his heal animation ends LUL
[2022-12-10 13:11:12] <gcgamingvariety> @gcgamingvariety i guess sooo
[2022-12-10 13:11:12] <Pkkls> kiriko just cancels the ana it's so strong
[2022-12-10 13:11:14] <%354hamtaro> Back when they giga-buffed Breather, I was and still am of the opinion that it should have been EITHER being able to move OR the damage reduction
[2022-12-10 13:11:26] <%JuunasWasTaken> just put him in an over and make some joulukinkku
[2022-12-10 13:11:29] <endcosmos> they could reduce his hp
[2022-12-10 13:11:43] <YukejOW> rein charge should do 400 damage with charge to hog only
[2022-12-10 13:11:46] <kingalba95> but hog is so fat he needs 700hp
[2022-12-10 13:11:50] <%+Skar_> @gcgamingvariety get out of his ult then rush him right after since he won't have any cd he falls instantly
[2022-12-10 13:11:53] <tokekberacun> hog is killable if he doesnt vape
[2022-12-10 13:12:15] <%mrgreenlantern69> make hog heavier so you can boop him consistently, right now he floats like a balloon
[2022-12-10 13:12:16] <%JuunasWasTaken> remove vape lhcloudyYEP
[2022-12-10 13:12:30] <%Austriansamurai1> as rein I can deal with his hooks, relatively easy to bait it, but 350 self heal every few seconds when I do 85 per swing is stupid
[2022-12-10 13:12:46] <DDawNeD> i would not mind seeing hog be completely useless
[2022-12-10 13:13:07] <%+Skar_> !whiff

[2022-12-10 13:13:15] <%354hamtaro> Making his ult a transformation ult is also SUCH a bad call.

[2022-12-10 13:15:43] <+Xeffary> do u think u've gotten a lot better at no-shielding since when u started the challenge in season 1?
[2022-12-10 13:15:45] <+sabre5395> the balanced hero is the friends we made along the way
[2022-12-10 13:15:56] <jjjcicivib> junk is op I think it's gg
[2022-12-10 13:15:59] <%JuunasWasTaken> cool
[2022-12-10 13:16:08] <kingalba95> doom's punch needs to be like when he was a dps, 250hp dmg when you hit a wall
[2022-12-10 13:16:15] <%GIRLinMaleBody> no
[2022-12-10 13:16:25] <%GIRLinMaleBody> doom should punch himself
[2022-12-10 13:16:26] <%mrgreenlantern69> that would be too strong

[2022-12-10 13:24:44] <cogginsnuff> @DDawNeD what you jsut described is not the standard ELO system, glad we agree

[2022-12-10 13:24:49] <+sabre5395> well how do you feel about the picture going down lol
[2022-12-10 13:24:55] <%+ecksdeexd69> So what’s the point then
[2022-12-10 13:24:57] <%+DaddyTiril> Okay but whats the point in putting ur rank down if theyre gonna put u in a game with the same people either way?
[2022-12-10 13:24:58] <+Xeffary> @LhCloudy27 do you think when the enemy team realises u cant shield the game gets harder?
[2022-12-10 13:25:02] <hellstedt_> the real meta is complaining about everyhing in ow out of a habit
[2022-12-10 13:25:04] <tirdni> i went from diamond 1 to gold 2. im not playing this game

[2022-12-10 13:26:14] <%Magicturtle12> i just think it's very cringe they have fake ranks displayed instead of SR
[2022-12-10 13:26:23] <%Magicturtle12> bad system
[2022-12-10 13:26:26] <+sabre5395> but why did the picture go down >:(
[2022-12-10 13:26:42] <+sabre5395> I don't like smaller picture
[2022-12-10 13:26:43] <kasper93> after 4 placements... doing 70% WR. it just pointless grind
[2022-12-10 13:26:47] <+NakiKataki> after 2 placements I've peaked higher than last season
[2022-12-10 13:26:54] <%Magicturtle12> "camping" only matters at top500
[2022-12-10 13:26:58] <terrestrialbug> you gain sr easier by winning until reach gm. ez to climb. noob friendly. that's why they lowered everyone so far down. bc its easy to get back
[2022-12-10 13:27:11] <cogginsnuff> ah yes just 14 wins when, assuming just a 50% winrate you gotta play 28 games, no on is camping their rank below gm LUL
[2022-12-10 13:27:21] <+sabre5395> Why not just have placements every season?
[2022-12-10 13:27:38] <%Magicturtle12> if you have masters SR you have masters SR idk what the problem is

[2022-12-10 13:29:07] <cogginsnuff> i see the argument for decay above diamond, but below theres just not much point, those players dont understand the game let alone the system

[2022-12-10 13:29:14] <+Liquid_N> can u explain why im facing legit top 500 players as a plat
[2022-12-10 13:29:15] <%Magicturtle12> i think it is dumb that your SR doesnt go down

[2022-12-10 13:38:20] <%Austriansamurai1> against orisa bastion your shield would have been useless anyway

[2022-12-10 13:41:20] <cogginsnuff> so the only difference between this and normal unranked to gm is 1 loss per 10?

[2022-12-10 13:41:23] <Thevrex> its almost like rein is about taking space and not holding a shield

[2022-12-10 16:05:19] <%Austriansamurai1> doom does damage even if bad

[2022-12-10 16:05:31] <skunky4x> I dno how you can win vs Orisas without a shield as rein. She wil just spear and spin to keep you away. Oh and kill you
[2022-12-10 16:05:32] <concernedisorder40> just shoot him
[2022-12-10 16:05:32] <%354hamtaro> @raylx79 sure but you still gotta know what to do on Doom or else perish
[2022-12-10 16:05:34] <%pseudonym1k> In low sr the doom kills my entire backline every fight
[2022-12-10 16:05:39] <beegspaghetti> low sr dooms just die
[2022-12-10 16:05:39] <%$finto> i play ball only on my alt account and its pretty free games

[2022-12-10 16:05:54] <%Austriansamurai1> yeah but its annoying
[2022-12-10 16:05:58] <%354hamtaro> Doom is easily one of the most mechanically demanding tanks right now
[2022-12-10 16:05:59] <+Nyhttz> Doom is not that easy to play

[2022-12-10 16:06:10] <%+Aceattack> i think his movement is what makes it difficult for bad aim
[2022-12-10 16:06:14] <+chesly_vakarian> charge punch stuns for like a second tho and low sr doom have perma charge punch
[2022-12-10 16:06:17] <+HydroElectricPlant> but chazm is like the ball tech god
[2022-12-10 16:06:26] <$weeblord069> everyone shoots doom deflect in low sr
[2022-12-10 16:06:36] <%Austriansamurai1> well low sr doom aren't good, but more annoying than ball
[2022-12-10 16:06:36] <+bear_bearow> That’s cause chazm is the one true ball

[2022-12-10 16:53:14] <GreenZero> We need a dps with aoe dmg and the ult kills everyone instant

[2022-12-10 17:28:03] <mixeryow> They should buff rein and give him a gun, problem solved
[2022-12-10 17:28:04] <+Ghostblade1> i had to stop playing ow2 for abit got super bored not ever being healed unless was a zen orb just not fun lol
[2022-12-10 17:28:05] <runnymorringggg> soldiers who run and kite you like tracer when you're rein = not easy
[2022-12-10 17:28:14] <%+sh0kw1v3> in higher SR, as Mr. Kephrii said, rein is a shield
[2022-12-10 17:28:23] <%+Skar_> REINLIFE

[2022-12-10 17:31:07] <Vayatir> If Reinhardt and Ramattra both start hitting each other at the same time, Reinhardt will win
[2022-12-10 17:31:13] <%kikyoyoyo> rein also punch through the shield lmao it is just a weaker version of ram
[2022-12-10 17:31:14] <GreenZero> He does less dmg through shield?
[2022-12-10 17:31:14] <Sshpongled> everyone thinks he counters rein just bc he shoots through shield Clueless

If you need coaching I can help, all you need to do is ask (dia 3 peak).

[2022-12-10 19:48:57] <runnymorringggg> kirk was slammed wasnt she? from slam. but she can still use spell to be unstunned??
[2022-12-10 19:49:01] <nammeechai> kiriko suzu has a delayed cast time so i think thats what was happening there when she shattered
[2022-12-10 19:49:03] <%Kakaobob> she threw her thing before getting stunned probably
[2022-12-10 19:49:04] <nammeechai> was^
