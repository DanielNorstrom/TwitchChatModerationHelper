[2022-12-15 18:34:40] <sadrgatt> @sadrgatt I can understand wanting players to play her more but her kit is annoying to play against. Especially if she has good supports healing her
[2022-12-15 18:34:46] <ignJUMPD> Ur reaper isn’t doing anything

[2022-12-15 18:36:04] <panda4ez> ah yea
[2022-12-15 18:36:17] <panda4ez> they have both no offense only defense
[2022-12-15 18:36:27] <panda4ez> but morocco looked very good vs france
[2022-12-15 18:36:30] <%AngryBanana10> torb

[2022-12-15 18:41:27] <panda4ez> @peteerl_ u think both france and argentina will score
[2022-12-15 18:41:36] <presence95> garlic WutFace
[2022-12-15 18:41:46] <panda4ez> I think so itll be either 2-1 for either team or draw at 1-1 or 2-2
[2022-12-15 18:41:46] <miidwxst> Too much garlic fs
[2022-12-15 18:41:54] <kammuz> france will win 3-0

[2022-12-15 18:42:03] <sadrgatt> 1-0 win for argentina
[2022-12-15 18:42:07] <+DrBadass808> didn't say that, im using the dps in his past game as an example. why play harder dps like genji and put up 1/3 everyone elses damage and lose? instead of playing something easier?
