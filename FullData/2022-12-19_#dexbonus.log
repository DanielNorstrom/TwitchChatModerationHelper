[2022-12-19 14:43:34] <msdartanya> They say that if you take their height at 2 years old and double it, it's going to be their full height as an adult. For my son it gives him 6' and for my daughter it gives her 5'8"
[2022-12-19 14:43:42] <+Munchima_Quchi> never had the pain but I still got the many scars like looks like I was whipped in a dungeon. Jumped from 5'4ish to 6'1 over 2 years

[2022-12-19 15:04:40] <@%ArnarBjornss> I updated yesterday and it's been working nicely (Hive) for me. Hopefully they get more stable soon overall.
[2022-12-19 15:04:42] <%KaiTheirin> Yeah, I prefer Hive’s UI. Mastodon is really hard to follow people on, but after that it’s whatever

[2022-12-19 15:04:44] <%Adrolien> @pzn01 and for some like Hive it doesn't even matter if you have the handle, others can have it too
[2022-12-19 15:04:45] <kylejv127> masterdon just looks like a new version of Google+
[2022-12-19 15:04:49] <%Annerie__> its still growing I suppose
[2022-12-19 15:04:52] <Sirius_Prime1> I think that's because it's federated right?
[2022-12-19 15:04:59] <MrPokeyLopeMD> I feel like we should just all revert to geosites/geocities at this stage…

[2022-12-19 15:05:20] <%floneus_lufts_dreames> Dodger hi
[2022-12-19 15:05:23] <RushUnplugged> we'll end up all back on mIRC
[2022-12-19 15:05:31] <%Noiremun> Sadly it seems like the optimal play here is to wait it out, which will either lead to twitter dying and most switching to one brand or it not dying and fixing itself eventually.
[2022-12-19 15:05:44] <Mojestic_Unicorn> Mastodon is really weird, I like it a lot but can definitely see that it won't be a platform for the masses due to a plethora of reasons.
[2022-12-19 15:05:51] <Swalsugmass> imo there is no like for like twitter alternative and thats alot of people probem
[2022-12-19 15:05:55] <Mex_tf2> and the time investment to grow on twitter Sadge...
[2022-12-19 15:06:01] <%Adrolien> even with the algorithms messing us twitter was still the best
[2022-12-19 15:06:04] <%TrashieBee> i never really used twitter, i just threw my art into the void of instagram
[2022-12-19 15:06:19] <%smoonsky6> yeah I never know where to post my art.
[2022-12-19 15:06:36] <derap41> Isn't that deviantart ?
[2022-12-19 15:06:38] <+chaymand0> Well if the poll he did is any indication things might change if Elon actually does step down

[2022-12-19 15:07:13] <%Brandling> @chaymand0 Bad faith actors are known for following up. Kappa
[2022-12-19 15:07:18] <RushUnplugged> yeah unfortunately no other SM can fill the void off twitter right now, not for the function it has. And none of the direct "replacements" really work as well
[2022-12-19 15:07:25] <%smoonsky6> has anyone tried artfol
[2022-12-19 15:07:26] <%Noiremun> I mean you can, its just not the front page
[2022-12-19 15:07:28] <D0cBrown> maybe letting a billionaire buy a 400 million user social media platform isn't the right definition of freedom but let's not get political ;)
[2022-12-19 15:07:30] <MrPokeyLopeMD> Tumblr and pixiv are my go to for art but i guess pixiv might be tricky
[2022-12-19 15:07:41] <%Annerie__> waiting for a package that should arrive 'end of day'
[2022-12-19 15:07:50] <%$Bloodfire212> DA is usually where I go after I follow someone on Twitter and wanna see more of their art, it’s like supplementary
[2022-12-19 15:07:50] <Heisuisui> well, its sad, but ppl have to adapt if it dies
[2022-12-19 15:07:51] <%TrashieBee> well soon you can just use AI to make art for you and cut out the middle man
[2022-12-19 15:07:53] <%Adrolien> That and most actual artists have abandoned deviantart over the AI art issues
[2022-12-19 15:07:58] <+Shadowlancer128> I have always preferred Reddit to the rest
[2022-12-19 15:08:10] <@%ArnarBjornss> I've seen folks struggle with Instagram also for discovery (how it displays things to you is odd sometimes, I barely see stuff from my friends unless it's a video story thing)
[2022-12-19 15:08:10] <theyellowflash7887> the interesting thing about all this is that it was always going to happen since twitter has never made money, its just that instead of quietly flopping its now going out in a ball of fire
[2022-12-19 15:08:11] <%EquinoxPhoenix> Pixiv is nigh unto impossible to use for me stripLUL

[2022-12-19 15:31:02] <TooRealTerrell> isopods will usually manage populations if they have consistent amounts of food, so as long as you aren't over feeding them you hopefully wont have population problems
[2022-12-19 15:31:04] <melanie_linares> Try putting some veg in the terrarium and you should see several come out of hiding.

[2022-12-19 15:31:50] <@%ArnarBjornss> I remember a story about a fish tank (in Japan I think). Suddenly the fish started disappearing. Then they discovered the big Bobbit worm in the sediment that had gone unnoticed.
[2022-12-19 15:31:52] <waffleho> they remind me of lucas the spider
[2022-12-19 15:31:57] <%+Money_Fish> jumping spiders are not as "spidery" as other spiders lol they don't move as jerky and they have lil stubby legs
