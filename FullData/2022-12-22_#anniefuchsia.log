[2022-12-22 14:07:37] <%Collnaris> screw second boss
[2022-12-22 14:07:55] <%Taylor131313> second boss is hell on earth
[2022-12-22 14:07:59] <%Swiggyswoo_> Second boss is rough but if you get that one the rest is easy at least
[2022-12-22 14:08:10] <%Taylor131313> that's a big 'if' LULW
[2022-12-22 14:08:21] <%Swiggyswoo_> easier than the tree so that's something KEKW
[2022-12-22 14:08:41] <%Swiggyswoo_> it's important that everyone plays that fight perfectly tho
[2022-12-22 14:08:43] <%Collnaris> if your group is still a group LULE
[2022-12-22 14:08:44] <%Swiggyswoo_> try to perma 10 stacks
[2022-12-22 14:08:49] <%Swiggyswoo_> but not take stacks at the wrong time cus then you die
[2022-12-22 14:09:25] <%Taylor131313> I'm still unsure of what makes you take damage there, the response seems to be 'everything' LULE
[2022-12-22 14:09:59] <%Swiggyswoo_> orbs do some damage but it's fairly minor as long as you dont soak a ton of orbs in 2 seconds
[2022-12-22 14:10:23] <%Swiggyswoo_> other than that it's the lightning circles which close to oneshot on higher keys
[2022-12-22 14:10:35] <%Swiggyswoo_> and then his 10 sec fkin aoe pulse bullshit WeirdDude
[2022-12-22 14:11:10] <%Taylor131313> the worst thing is that you have to stay spread to soak and cuz circles are huge
[2022-12-22 14:13:06] <%Swiggyswoo_> you dont take any damage afterwards anyways so it's safe at least

[2022-12-22 14:40:41] <%Sne4ky79> so i just listened to a discussion , so thq got renamed to thq nordic then got bought up by embracer group that then again renamed it to thq nordic but old dev team no more? LUL
[2022-12-22 14:40:54] <%Sne4ky79> heckin confusing
[2022-12-22 14:41:10] <%Geoffku> WAYTOODANK
[2022-12-22 14:41:30] <%Sne4ky79> its just the name brand that got bought?
[2022-12-22 14:41:35] <%NoName6834> FeelsDankMan huh
[2022-12-22 14:42:09] <%PanicRush> they bought the studio and changed the devs?
[2022-12-22 14:42:19] <%Sne4ky79> yeah
[2022-12-22 14:42:41] <%PanicRush> the real question is why is it called "nordic" if their offices are in germany and spain xdd
[2022-12-22 14:43:14] <%Sne4ky79> its was discussed due to new warhammer 40k  been made by thq nordic
[2022-12-22 14:44:05] <%Sne4ky79> @panicrush anniesShrug
[2022-12-22 14:44:53] <%Sne4ky79> basically just bought the brand "Thq nordic" but its a new team has old team got fired
[2022-12-22 14:45:14] <%PanicRush> well yeah, same way it happened to Obsidian for example
[2022-12-22 14:45:39] <%Sne4ky79> oh yeah true they did
[2022-12-22 14:46:04] <%PanicRush> the idea is to keep the recognizable name so old fans get more attracted
[2022-12-22 14:46:28] <%PanicRush> Outer Worlds was advertised as "a game from Fallout New Vegas devs" although those devs are long gone
[2022-12-22 14:46:44] <%Sne4ky79> could backfire though if dev team doesnt do good
[2022-12-22 14:47:11] <%PanicRush> YEP thats the Cyberpunk 2077 story
[2022-12-22 14:47:16] <%Sne4ky79> luckily in the case of obsidian and thq nordic it went great
[2022-12-22 14:47:41] <%PanicRush> yes, its basically a sort of safety net, so even a mediocre game sells just for the name
[2022-12-22 14:47:42] <%Sne4ky79> with outer worlds has an example
[2022-12-22 14:48:20] <%PanicRush> like when some shitty movies hire a big actor for a few scenes just so they can feature them on the poster and in the trailer and attract the viewers LULW
[2022-12-22 14:48:35] <%Sne4ky79> LUL
[2022-12-22 14:52:50] <%Sne4ky79> Talking about bad movies , i watched black adam on hbo max
[2022-12-22 14:53:23] <%Sne4ky79> big name actors but , the movie was crap
[2022-12-22 14:54:19] <%Collnaris> ye, heard it was bad
[2022-12-22 14:55:03] <%PanicRush> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfrmzSX4J-M
[2022-12-22 14:55:11] <%PanicRush> i watched this instead and got the idea
[2022-12-22 14:56:26] <%drzaius30> pretty sure all super hero movies have merged into an amorphous blob in my mind LUL
[2022-12-22 14:56:51] <%Sne4ky79> doctor strange was good though

[2022-12-22 14:57:13] <%Sne4ky79> and black panther
[2022-12-22 14:58:12] <%Sne4ky79> but overall yes dc and marvel series/movies aint good
[2022-12-22 14:58:37] <%PanicRush> i liked the new spider man movies
[2022-12-22 14:58:44] <%PanicRush> with tom holland
[2022-12-22 14:59:06] <%Geoffku> spidey's always good
[2022-12-22 14:59:30] <%Sne4ky79> i haven't watched the new spiderman yet but the tom holland spiderman has been good
[2022-12-22 14:59:32] <%drzaius30> still can't believe that shitty halo show got made
[2022-12-22 14:59:44] <%Sne4ky79> not watched that

[2022-12-22 15:00:20] <%drzaius30> knew it was bad the second they ignored the source material
[2022-12-22 15:00:27] <%+Alastor7783> I watched like 2 episodes

[2022-12-22 15:02:01] <%Geoffku> it's HBO right?
[2022-12-22 15:02:06] <%drzaius30> just a matter if it becomes filler or actually good extra stuff

[2022-12-22 15:15:20] <%drzaius30> @Geoffku Spyro got a remake anniesLurk
[2022-12-22 15:15:36] <%drzaius30> the 2018 version is pretty YEP
[2022-12-22 15:15:40] <%Geoffku> oh you're playing the remake PogO
[2022-12-22 15:16:22] <%drzaius30> the remake plays the same YEP
[2022-12-22 15:16:53] <%Taylor131313> 1 and 3 are the best YEP
[2022-12-22 15:17:02] <%Geoffku> ye but it's funnier to imagine playing the shitty looking original version instead LULE
[2022-12-22 15:17:05] <%Taylor131313> 2 has way too much forced backtracking for 100% anniesHeadache
[2022-12-22 15:17:13] <%drzaius30> also hilarious because the spyro 2 method of gaining lives was accidently included in spyro one
[2022-12-22 15:18:01] <%Swiggyswoo_> Anyone else not phasing when joining grps?
[2022-12-22 15:18:08] <%drzaius30> I prefer 2 over 3 YEP
[2022-12-22 15:18:29] <%drzaius30> didn't like playing the other characters
[2022-12-22 15:19:15] <%Taylor131313> i got tilted in the remakes because already from like the 2nd level you can't fully complete the level and you're forced to come back when you unlock skills LULW

[2022-12-22 15:19:43] <%Taylor131313> when I played the original on PS1 I used the cheat code to unlock skills right away so I wouldn't need to backtrack xdd

[2022-12-22 18:38:17] <%Taylor131313> I miss 8.3 when cloaks didn't drop
[2022-12-22 18:40:03] <%$loppish91> remember legion no weapons kind of sad even if you had the best weapon ever LUL
[2022-12-22 18:40:05] <%Swiggyswoo_> Finally got windows 11 installed

[2022-12-22 18:47:27] <%Geoffku> btw what's the minimum ilvl of a piece you should try to get before upgrading?
[2022-12-22 18:47:55] <%Taylor131313> 392-395 I'd say
[2022-12-22 18:48:01] <%Taylor131313> valor is very limited
[2022-12-22 18:48:08] <%Geoffku> aight
[2022-12-22 18:52:00] <%Swiggyswoo_> just hoard till you get like 405s+ eventually imo
[2022-12-22 18:52:22] <%Swiggyswoo_> unless it's smth like court of stars ring that's definitely 0.001% chance to drop
[2022-12-22 18:54:05] <%Swiggyswoo_> Blissart fix craft orders I need my lariat PepeHands
[2022-12-22 18:55:14] <%$Hasan_Lurker> Sadge
[2022-12-22 19:01:36] <%Geoffku> I wanna spend valor and get dopamine blissart BabyRage
[2022-12-22 19:02:14] <%Taylor131313> they should've uncapped valor but capped upgrade level, increasing it each week
[2022-12-22 19:02:26] <%Geoffku> that would've been pog
[2022-12-22 19:08:26] <%PanicRush> should i upgrade my 392 weapon to 395? anniesThink
[2022-12-22 19:10:03] <%Swiggyswoo_> id say no, 395 / 398 keys are gonna be easy

[2022-12-22 21:54:02] <%PanicRush> i accidentally invited 4 frenchies into the group xddx
[2022-12-22 21:56:26] <%drzaius30> 🥖
[2022-12-22 21:56:50] <%PanicRush> i laughed so hard when one of them said "le hunt" for some reason xddgarlic
[2022-12-22 22:00:35] <%PanicRush> oh yea, i got ruby cringe pools 13 AGAIN LULW
[2022-12-22 22:00:57] <%PanicRush> how come 3 out of 4 keys i have are this same dungeon LUL
[2022-12-22 22:03:50] <%Taylor131313> xdd
[2022-12-22 22:04:09] <%PneumaWHU> i tried pugging 2 ruby 11s, didn't get past 1st boss...
[2022-12-22 22:08:08] <%Taylor131313> was my ruby 11 really a miracle? we 2 chested monkaS
[2022-12-22 22:08:56] <%Taylor131313> if that's the case then I'm content with it until further nerfs xdd
[2022-12-22 22:09:16] <%PneumaWHU> first run got boss down to 20ish% then i died cos got no heals when moved away with the circle
[2022-12-22 22:09:19] <%PneumaWHU> wiped soon after
[2022-12-22 22:09:30] <%Taylor131313> anniesSole
[2022-12-22 22:09:46] <%PneumaWHU> second run ret paladin died almost on pull, got rezzed, died again instantly
[2022-12-22 22:10:04] <%Taylor131313> bursting grevious is just horrible as a combo
[2022-12-22 22:10:11] <%Taylor131313> ok that's just the paladin affix
[2022-12-22 22:10:14] <%PanicRush> yea, i hoped the nerfs in pools will be more impactful
[2022-12-22 22:10:32] <%PanicRush> tbf tyrannical week as well, but still bosses there feel overtuned af
[2022-12-22 22:10:36] <%Taylor131313> boss HP nerf helps a bit but there's a lot of damage stoll
[2022-12-22 22:11:36] <%Taylor131313> bosses generally hurt a lot, even SBG which is the easiest hurts a metric fuckton at 15
[2022-12-22 22:12:34] <%Taylor131313> I don't think I've ever had to use my defensive this often to survive unavoidable damage, says a lot about how dungeons are tuned
[2022-12-22 22:12:42] <%+Chryterion> 22/12/22 22:12:22 has passed
[2022-12-22 22:12:53] <%PneumaWHU> no it hasn't
[2022-12-22 22:12:56] <%Taylor131313> ah shit
[2022-12-22 22:12:57] <%PneumaWHU> it's 21:12
[2022-12-22 22:13:13] <%+Chryterion> Ow yeah
[2022-12-22 22:13:26] <%+Chryterion> !time
[2022-12-22 22:13:26] <@%^Annies_Bot> Current time in Europe/Stockholm is 22:13 (CET)
[2022-12-22 22:15:17] <%Taylor131313> like even coil on cooldown or else I'm constantly at half hp at best, big ouchie
[2022-12-22 22:37:33] <%PanicRush> just did sbg 12, only died once on a huge trash pull
