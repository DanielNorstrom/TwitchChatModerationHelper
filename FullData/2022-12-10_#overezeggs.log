[2022-12-10 06:37:21] <%antroz93> honestly, thats a terrible idea. the games are out of order, and DMC 3 is the first game in the timeline

[2022-12-10 06:39:10] <%Vengrimm> if you watch all of the lroe in one video itllprobably be about 1.5 hrs

[2022-12-10 06:39:19] <%antroz93> @AJ_Hyper_Bit yeah but she said leading up to DMC 3. which would be stopping at the start of the video
[2022-12-10 06:39:54] <!KeyshaunG> getting kicked by egg, don't mind if I do
[2022-12-10 06:40:16] <%CoopKaiju> I assume that somebody named Devil May is crying, that fact that this isn’t a blubbers simulation, makes it a hard pass
[2022-12-10 06:40:25] <%BobaManZz> @KeyshaunG 4 takes place before 3 right?
[2022-12-10 06:40:48] <%antroz93> @BobaManZz no 3 is first in the timeline
[2022-12-10 06:40:50] <!KeyshaunG> no
[2022-12-10 06:40:51] <%Vengrimm> just for the context of Nero. The sword belonged to a Half Demon dude named Virgil, and it has a lot of power in it which Nero can tap into for *some reason*
[2022-12-10 06:40:56] <%Dang_old_Dixie> Sword revving during combo is amazing

[2022-12-10 06:41:05] <%BobaManZz> @BobaManZz OH right right right
[2022-12-10 06:41:05] <!KeyshaunG> 4 is years after 2
[2022-12-10 06:41:08] <%Dang_old_Dixie> This game has some great combo game going on

[2022-12-10 06:41:31] <%RatAcid> WHAT
[2022-12-10 06:41:51] <%Dang_old_Dixie> DMC 4 is: Guy living in a church cult meets DMC but doesn't know anything. Just like egg
[2022-12-10 06:41:56] <%$SilentVash> Much lurking has been had. Fighting with my router atm but overall been good
[2022-12-10 06:41:57] <%haiddon> @KeyshaunG so that means the timeline is 3, 1, 2, 4, 5?
[2022-12-10 06:42:09] <%RatAcid> so according to chat 3 is the first but 4 is before 3 and 2 is way before 3...
[2022-12-10 06:42:25] <%Dang_old_Dixie> This is a great game to just get in on it all
[2022-12-10 06:42:30] <%haiddon> @RatAcid whoever is saying 4 is before 3 is wrong
[2022-12-10 06:42:32] <%antroz93> @KeyshaunG 3, 1, the anime series, 2, 4, 5

[2022-12-10 06:43:00] <!KeyshaunG> the order is 3, 1, anime, 2, 4, comics, manga, 5

[2022-12-10 06:43:15] <%ceazoul> Sounds like Street Fighter’s canonical order, not helped that it’s by the same developer.
[2022-12-10 06:43:22] <%haiddon> @Dang_old_Dixie don't people actually like 5 though?
[2022-12-10 06:43:27] <!KeyshaunG> @dang_old_dixie what's wrong with 5
[2022-12-10 06:43:47] <%Dang_old_Dixie> @KeyshaunG Only X weapon can hit X enemy, honestly
