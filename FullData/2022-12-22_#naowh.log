[2022-12-22 11:12:17] <%+Grenai> @Heia2616 there is some blood DK tech that can push blood even further ahead during the final phase

[2022-12-22 16:30:16] <+Tyrox_Jim> 200 Would be absurd i think ,there's still a whole other phase

[2022-12-22 16:49:03] <Ggx_TV> This fight is so healing intensive. I don't even see DPS checks. The shield barrier is easy if everyone is alive, it's not tight. Basically if everyone is alive, Prog is made.
