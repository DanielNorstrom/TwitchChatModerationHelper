[2022-12-10 11:06:13] <%umce> LOL
[2022-12-10 11:06:16] <%fwumper> depends on how frequently it shows up

[2022-12-10 11:07:24] <%+redsamurai_1> as long as it's not every few minutes  at least 1 an hour is bearable
[2022-12-10 11:07:25] <%twofivefour> That sounds fair, doesn't affect me but if it showed up too frequently it would be annoying

[2022-12-10 11:12:52] <Nightingale147> when its saying to give bits, sub, prime and other things then it just feels like your chat means nothing but money to u and not just enjoying your chat
