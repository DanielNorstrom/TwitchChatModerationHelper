[2022-12-28 22:29:31] <nazorai> when you're in a raid its fine but outside of it its full chaos
[2022-12-28 22:29:35] <!%bender99zz> if they start drops and if the servers are not fixed its just gonna be a lot of people watching stashes.

[2022-12-28 22:30:08] <%tronzorb> @WillerZ It's because it's the same EVERY time.  It's like they refuse to resource up for wipe.  So frustrating.

[2022-12-28 23:09:04] <%+SuperNuts> @aKa__DoPe nah easier to play as bear, because of the quest to kill 20 of the opposite factions. killing 20 usec is a lot easier than 20 bears.

Do you like taking fights where your opponent is unaware?    THEN FRIENDS... Have you considered EXTRACT CAMPING? The bushes and shrubberies around Railway and Emercom are perfect for ambushes... and you will level up your metabolism and soft skills while you wait for your loot to be delivered. Good luck and happy exfil camping!
