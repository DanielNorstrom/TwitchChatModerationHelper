[2022-12-15 17:38:13] <%+Calvinman4> @kinkykinki then maybe the time we saw it had nothing to do with the T5 skin... only other thing I could say is that we had the farm fountain skin as well and for some reason people thought it had to do with that too

[2022-12-15 17:40:37] <%+SWAN_R0NS0N> I think the trick is to have two guardians

[2022-12-15 17:41:29] <%+lightforceten> Can’t help but notice incon seems to have a few more buffs than his teammate there
[2022-12-15 17:41:41] <%+TruePlewd> dmg builds on guardians with decent clear feels like it'd be fine, but I feel like most guardians are building like normal guardians
[2022-12-15 17:42:01] <%Debaucherous> @Incon I know it's a bit late... but I forgot 5 subs got a request.. Could I do a request for those from yesterday?

[2022-12-15 17:48:56] <%Danger_Corpse> Then not Ra.
[2022-12-15 17:48:59] <%Debaucherous> Tanks can't win..but they waste your time so you might now too xD
[2022-12-15 17:49:06] <%+Calvinman4> @Lucasinyo oh not for support lemme think
[2022-12-15 17:49:06] <%Debaucherous> not*
[2022-12-15 17:49:21] <%+lightforceten> @lucasinyo ymir
[2022-12-15 17:49:37] <%+lightforceten> Geb generally but he’s not meta rn
[2022-12-15 17:49:37] <@%$air2jodran3> @lightforceten no way
[2022-12-15 17:49:37] <%+Calvinman4> @Lucasinyo bacchus is pretty easy, atlas is strong and pretty safe
[2022-12-15 17:49:45] <%+Calvinman4> @lightforceten I actually have never thought ymir is that easy
[2022-12-15 17:49:49] <%+Calvinman4> yeah thank you jordan
[2022-12-15 17:49:53] <%Cloud_Sora> @Lucasinyo horus, fafnir, ymir (for growth), bacchus, atlas take your pick

[2022-12-15 17:50:02] <%Cloud_Sora> ymir is your target
[2022-12-15 17:50:03] <Lucasinyo> this game looks really fun !
[2022-12-15 17:50:07] <%+lightforceten> Bacchus isn’t hard but you have to manage your mana
[2022-12-15 17:50:13] <%+TruePlewd> pure tank/sustain partnered with a hyper farmer like baka. tank runs around being a general pain in the butt wasting everyone's time as the hyper farmer does his thing lol
[2022-12-15 17:50:15] <%Cloud_Sora> generally pick people with good escape/engage safety
[2022-12-15 17:50:28] <GhostyrexJake> i got a very close 2nd place using Tyr and had a vulcan first and only time playing this mode
[2022-12-15 17:50:34] <%+Calvinman4> @lightforceten true, but with the spike still being pretty meta (i think?) you barely have to think about it
[2022-12-15 17:50:39] <%Debaucherous> I've been actually workin the past day or two, so I haven't been able to pay attention if you said it already.... 1-10..how much do you  like this mode

[2022-12-15 17:51:12] <%+lightforceten> @calvinman4 @air2jodran3 he teaches you positioning, he does good damage, his abilities are simple to understand and smite gives him to you for free. If you’re playing against other beginners he’s fine

[2022-12-15 17:51:44] <%Cloud_Sora> @lightforceten yes but smite matchmaking wont put you with other beginners and you will get curbstomped
[2022-12-15 17:52:04] <@%$air2jodran3> @lightforceten you're only taught positioning if you understand what's going on, when I first played Smite I had no idea what was going on. also his wall is not easy to use or understand and using your ult makes you very easy to kill
[2022-12-15 17:52:18] <%+lightforceten> @cloud_sora well that’s a separate problem
[2022-12-15 17:52:26] <%+Calvinman4> @lightforceten i agree that he is a good god to learn things like that on, but you can learn a lot about how to be a support without also choosing a god who is punishing to not already know it
[2022-12-15 17:52:33] <%Cloud_Sora> it is but it is a problem you have to take into account
[2022-12-15 17:52:42] <%+lightforceten> @air2jodran3 when you started you couldn’t cancel the wall
[2022-12-15 17:52:42] <%+Calvinman4> like I've played this game for 2k hours and ymir is still a god I have trouble with
[2022-12-15 17:52:48] <+jsrc1115> Omg man

[2022-12-15 17:54:09] <%Debaucherous> They should increase the number of wards you can have in this mode to 3.. but increase the price.

[2022-12-15 20:03:10] <@%+schwarzpastor> @Incon okay, but does Hades win because of girth or does Barron win by length?
[2022-12-15 20:03:10] <@%MichaelxVoorheees> you do
[2022-12-15 20:03:14] <%Spud_Master311> baron suck should win once the passive is applied
[2022-12-15 20:03:18] <%dognus88> but if there was a gab between them who would win by sucking the other one off first?
[2022-12-15 20:03:24] <%dognus88> gap*
[2022-12-15 20:03:33] <%+ExSploderMan> i'm actually a little surprised more people don't pick hades in this

[2022-12-15 20:03:34] <%Cloud_Sora> but the thing is which has a longer duration because if barons lasts longer that is damage and a stun for the baron

[2022-12-15 22:34:49] <%+acraine1> Great dialogue
[2022-12-15 22:36:07] <%+bigo26shen> from my days the only one that was meh was Tony
[2022-12-15 22:36:18] <ItsTheVega> She’s like a C- character unfortunately. She needs a rework.
[2022-12-15 22:36:28] <ItsTheVega> Probably the worst legendary atm
[2022-12-15 22:37:06] <ItsTheVega> And yeah iron man got big buffs. Part of one of the best raid teams in the game.
[2022-12-15 22:38:01] <ItsTheVega> Yeah alliance raids. But his team is still good in all the other game modes.
[2022-12-15 22:38:14] <%+bigo26shen> in my day i had 7 star brotherhood and only person that had like 7 star sinister six before doc oc got realeased when they were kinda bad just cause i liked them lol

[2022-12-15 22:45:05] <ItsTheVega> @incon she’s only good on her team Dormhold but is the worst member in her team.you  need that team to unlock apocalypse.
[2022-12-15 22:45:11] <%ucfhockey10> Scarlet Witch is ok but the darkhold group she is part of is OP

[2022-12-15 22:55:45] <neurak_> inconHi
[2022-12-15 22:57:05] <ItsTheVega> You should also try unlock Shang chi. Very easy character to unlock and is extremely good in just about everything.
[2022-12-15 23:00:16] <%mosecubed> Incon, you got me into this around 484 days ago, and I got super duper hooked.
[2022-12-15 23:01:11] <ItsTheVega> Shang ult is gonna ruin your day
[2022-12-15 23:01:32] <%mosecubed> Shang do be kickin
[2022-12-15 23:02:14] <ItsTheVega> Shang is my highest toon. 220k lol
[2022-12-15 23:02:58] <+blockey87> Yeah he’s a beast
[2022-12-15 23:03:15] <+blockey87> Been playing this a while, hope you’re enjoying it :)
[2022-12-15 23:03:49] <ItsTheVega> Thanos sisters coming in clutch
[2022-12-15 23:03:57] <ItsTheVega> Daughters

[2022-12-15 23:04:51] <%mosecubed> Yuh, his special heals everyone a percentage of his health, which is considerable.

[2022-12-15 23:06:29] <ItsTheVega> @mosecubed how are your minions looking for tomorrow?
[2022-12-15 23:06:53] <%mosecubed> Taskmaster is great
[2022-12-15 23:07:05] <ItsTheVega> Yeah do taskmaster
[2022-12-15 23:07:29] <%mosecubed> @ItsTheVega lol........gear 12...I'm hoping to just unlock Archangel.
[2022-12-15 23:08:02] <%mosecubed> Taskmaster is on one of the new war teams and it's like top 5 strongest war teams.
[2022-12-15 23:08:39] <ItsTheVega> Loki sucks right now. And probably take out shocker? Goblin and taskmaster have synergy so that’ll help
[2022-12-15 23:09:14] <%mosecubed> Loki primarily just speeds up better characters.
[2022-12-15 23:09:17] <ItsTheVega> @mosecubed yeah same mine are gear 11 with except for lt and riot which are 13.
[2022-12-15 23:09:25] <%mosecubed> Scarlet spider pull is huge!
[2022-12-15 23:10:00] <%mosecubed> @ItsTheVega It felt so bad taking minions that high, dawg...
[2022-12-15 23:10:16] <%mosecubed> Kestrel
[2022-12-15 23:10:27] <%mosecubed> Kestrel is one of the best characters in the game.
[2022-12-15 23:11:03] <%mosecubed> Ah yes.
[2022-12-15 23:11:08] <ItsTheVega> @mosecubed yeah but they said they toned down the minion nodes so here’s hoping. I do have like 130 gold and training orbs saved up if I do have up upgrade some more for diff 5.
[2022-12-15 23:11:58] <%mosecubed> @ItsTheVega You are stronger than I. I know we're supposed to hoard for special events, but I don't have the restraint when it comes to gold
[2022-12-15 23:12:10] <%mosecubed> Taskmaster Ultimate and Passive are best
[2022-12-15 23:12:46] <%mosecubed> Yea, cuz blind goes crazy and assisting all the time is good
[2022-12-15 23:13:08] <ItsTheVega> Goblin has the underworld tag so it taskmaster passive helps him to
[2022-12-15 23:14:02] <ItsTheVega> @mosecubed yeah as soon i heard minions I went into hoard mode

[2022-12-15 23:23:10] <%+Warshark22> Rhino is the heartbeat of the team, just like rudy
[2022-12-15 23:23:10] <%mosecubed> He'll be there when you need him. Or he won't.
[2022-12-15 23:23:55] <%mosecubed> Nobu (from the Hand) and Kingpin
[2022-12-15 23:24:40] <ItsTheVega> Click the filters and select ‘underworld’ and it’ll show his entire team.
[2022-12-15 23:24:42] <LeonWuu247> Only using Villains, huh? (Incon HEEL Turn) PowerUpL TheIlluminati krystaaMoney
[2022-12-15 23:25:00] <%mosecubed> It's worth. Kingpin and Nobu and Goblin do well at letting Taskmaster hit the other team with assists.
[2022-12-15 23:25:00] <%+Warshark22> oh how the turn tables.....turn
[2022-12-15 23:25:33] <%+TruePlewd> Rhino is hiding a cool character in the comics as well. He's a super villain, but he's still got a lot of the small time street crook mentality where he tries extremely hard to leave bystanders and people who can't defend themselves alone. He's left multiple teams because they started doing things he found awful or unnecessarily harmful.
[2022-12-15 23:25:50] <%+TruePlewd> rhino is actually a cool character*
[2022-12-15 23:25:59] <ItsTheVega> @mosecubed ravavgers merc lt and guard are the best team for tomorrow apparently.
[2022-12-15 23:26:03] <LeonWuu247> @Warshark22 LUL
[2022-12-15 23:26:44] <%mosecubed> @ItsTheVega I have Hydra Grenadier swapped out because I had already leveled him for Villains nodes.
[2022-12-15 23:26:52] <%+Andy1134> A lot of villains turn out to be more interesting than heroes in comics.
[2022-12-15 23:26:56] <%+Andy1134> I cast gun
[2022-12-15 23:26:57] <%+TruePlewd> Taskmaster also isn't really much of a villain and only generally finds himself on the bad side because "the bad guys pay better" lol
[2022-12-15 23:27:01] <%mosecubed> for Merc Lt*
[2022-12-15 23:27:56] <%+TruePlewd> yup. pure mercenary mentality with a little "looking for a challenge" thrown in
[2022-12-15 23:28:00] <%+Andy1134> Does Rhino run in a circle to get back to his spot while yelling
[2022-12-15 23:29:11] <+OpAzrael> Do you have a link so I could download?
[2022-12-15 23:29:18] <%+TruePlewd> and Norman Osborn might be a hero right now
[2022-12-15 23:30:20] <%+TruePlewd> later!
[2022-12-15 23:30:40] <%+Andy1134> @TruePlewd you mean his iron patriot
[2022-12-15 23:31:13] <%+TruePlewd> @andy1134 nope. Peter's current mentor/ benefit and the Gold Goblin
[2022-12-15 23:31:21] <%+TruePlewd> benefactor*
[2022-12-15 23:31:52] <%+Andy1134> @TruePlewd Ah, Ive not seen the recent stories.
[2022-12-15 23:32:28] <%+TruePlewd> so far, it looks like the Judgement event in the comics pretty profoundly effected Norman, but every reader is suspicious of if it'll stick lol
