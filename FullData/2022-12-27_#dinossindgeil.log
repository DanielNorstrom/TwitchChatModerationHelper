[2022-12-27 16:08:26] <%+unagiro> So you have to go to Gowry and then fight O'Niel to get a needle. give the needle to Gowry, reset, go to the plaigue church. give the needle to her and reset till she leaves. go to gowrys schack twize to meet them both. then go to the lux ruins site of grace to meet her again. then you need the valkyrie prostheses. Now you have sex with dex for the threads or you can continue the quest in windmil village.

[2022-12-27 16:33:53] <%BanjoTheUncle> "Ulcerated" is related to the various ulcers that the boss has all over its body
[2022-12-27 16:33:53] <%Zormi> ulcerated means "really mad" basically @dinossindgeil

[2022-12-27 16:36:52] <%+Kittyhavoc> @dinossindgeil i learned something today that would blow the minds of "masculinity" bros - you can have high testosterone but there is a protein that attacks it making it sort of inert, which is what hormone check found for me

[2022-12-27 17:58:21] <+hotmessmasta> Rock sling didn‚Äôt work for me in this fight and I was so frustrated
[2022-12-27 17:58:26] <hemiak> This guy is a dick. You can get some quick attacks after some of his combos but if you want to land anything but safely you have to wait for one of his jumping plunging attacks.

[2022-12-27 18:04:10] <%Hornypotsmoker> yea too slow
[2022-12-27 18:04:14] <$SurrealJC> it doesnt go that far when I use that dagger weapon art.
[2022-12-27 18:04:19] <%AsherCanid> Ice spear helped me a lot
[2022-12-27 18:04:32] <%Hornypotsmoker> pebble its legit best dmg per FP cost
[2022-12-27 18:04:33] <%+SteveBob104> Although to be fair, any Melee strat will be death if you get hit LUL
[2022-12-27 18:04:36] <+Hampy87> Have you tryed something with sword dance? Grave scythe e. G.
[2022-12-27 18:04:37] <nashdur> is this boss unroteable??
[2022-12-27 18:04:42] <%+SteveBob104> Frost is the best bet

[2022-12-27 18:04:47] <%remiri> yep cant rot her
[2022-12-27 18:04:49] <$PyroBebop> ice spear is a AoW
[2022-12-27 18:04:51] <%AsherCanid> AoW on a spear
[2022-12-27 18:04:54] <%+SteveBob104> Square off could work
[2022-12-27 18:05:00] <%+SteveBob104> Lion's Claw is better though
[2022-12-27 18:05:10] <%+SteveBob104> YEP smash her
[2022-12-27 18:05:10] <hemiak> Just try dragon balls on this bosses face. I hear that‚Äôs very distracting. SeriousSloth
[2022-12-27 18:05:13] <%meinMestar> Lions claw is on claymore
[2022-12-27 18:05:13] <%+Farfalla_Vendetta_> square off could be strong here. you can easiliy break her poise
[2022-12-27 18:05:14] <+Hampy87> sword dance hits twice and staggers
[2022-12-27 18:05:16] <$SurrealJC> its the front flip
[2022-12-27 18:05:16] <%+SteveBob104> I think you get it from Fort Gael or something
[2022-12-27 18:05:18] <%AsherCanid> Already have it, from a night cavalry
[2022-12-27 18:05:19] <+themiggsy> i used comet azul and tera magica then when she chased me i used stars of ruin
[2022-12-27 18:05:24] <+themiggsy> made the fight reallllly easy
[2022-12-27 18:05:26] <%+alexcon18> lions claw is a really good ash of war
[2022-12-27 18:05:27] <%BanjoTheUncle> I think you have it
[2022-12-27 18:05:31] <%thekidindigo> I think you already have ice spear, you just need to put it on a weapon
[2022-12-27 18:05:33] <%+alexcon18> but its probs too slow for alecto
[2022-12-27 18:05:34] <%+SteveBob104> Lion's Claw will knock her down
[2022-12-27 18:05:34] <%remiri> cold affix your broadsword and square off is an option

[2022-12-27 18:10:20] <%remiri> it should work
[2022-12-27 18:10:20] <%+SteveBob104> True, but the weapon arts can consistently knock her down
[2022-12-27 18:10:28] <%meinMestar> She often just spams attacks and you can chuck shit at her during the combos
[2022-12-27 18:10:38] <%+SteveBob104> Well, not sure about this one YEP

[2022-12-27 18:13:55] <%Hornypotsmoker> happens when you take a shower and fall asleep with it wet KEKWTF
[2022-12-27 18:13:59] <%+SteveBob104> You could just put chilling mist on a sword for a lot less FP
[2022-12-27 18:14:03] <%meinMestar> Make use of the lower defences kazoodNODDERS then it is
[2022-12-27 18:14:06] <%$Doudoussin> Pretty sure it deals more damage than an entire FP bar's worth of night shards

[2022-12-27 18:14:30] <%remiri> im warming up to hoarfrost stomp for this run in general
[2022-12-27 18:14:32] <%Dooglie> half health Pog
[2022-12-27 18:14:33] <%+alexcon18> shouldnt you be using staff of loss when using night shard?
[2022-12-27 18:14:35] <%remiri> even nerfed it is good for frost procs
[2022-12-27 18:14:36] <%Dooglie> almost...
[2022-12-27 18:14:38] <%$Doudoussin> Oh yeah why not hoarfrost stomp
[2022-12-27 18:14:43] <%+SteveBob104> Yeah, Hoarfrost and Chilling Mist would both work
[2022-12-27 18:14:48] <%+SteveBob104> Hoarfrost
[2022-12-27 18:14:52] <%thekidindigo> ^^

[2022-12-27 18:14:53] <%Hornypotsmoker> too far for sling

[2022-12-27 18:15:06] <%+SteveBob104> It'll stagger her and frost her
[2022-12-27 18:15:10] <%remiri> applies frost and doesnt cost a full FP bar
[2022-12-27 18:15:12] <%BanjoTheUncle> Remember that she's got really high ice resist at this point too
[2022-12-27 18:15:22] <+hotmessmasta> It stuns her and it does the frost
[2022-12-27 18:15:23] <%+SteveBob104> It's way less FP
[2022-12-27 18:15:29] <%thekidindigo> better FP cost efficiency
[2022-12-27 18:15:29] <%Hornypotsmoker> your burning FP
[2022-12-27 18:15:33] <%meinMestar> That's why i suggest pebbles

[2022-12-27 18:36:12] <Bubalgebra> Number 6: Man urinates on fellow passenger for not being allowed to smoke. An Algerian man was arrested in February 2016 on arrival of his flight, after causing a fight on the plane then urinating on another passenger. The incidents took place mid-air on an Air M√©diterran√©e flight from Algiers to Paris. Halfway through his 90-minute route, one of the passengers was outraged because he wasn't allowed to smoke or drink alcohol on board.
