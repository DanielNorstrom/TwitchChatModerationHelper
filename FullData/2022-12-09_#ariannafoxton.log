[2022-12-09 20:06:35] <terra_live5> he got arrested
[2022-12-09 20:06:47] <!%TheSwatKnight> the only thing I heard was that it was a dog whistle people used before? no idea though so I don't care swatShrug

[2022-12-09 20:09:17] <%LossyInput> yeah i dont think it's anything to freak out over

[2022-12-09 20:12:20] <%Saiokokun> On a positive note about the game awards, one of the musicians who played flute/tube and some other instrument ABSOLUTELY vibed and was for me the highlight of the awards show, such a awesome musician
[2022-12-09 20:12:23] <PantsOnHeadVR> people are so obsessed with award show drama
[2022-12-09 20:12:44] <RADSMILE> i mean the music past was kinda cool
[2022-12-09 20:12:45] <%Kamikaze17> only exception to this I think is fighting game announcements that happen on Evo during the finals of the related game since it mashes so well then
[2022-12-09 20:12:51] <Kiav> Hey I like seeing the celebrities! Did you they got Teal'c side by side with Al Pacino?
[2022-12-09 20:12:58] <Rooboy> The opinions of game review companies makes up 90% of the game awards votes anyways

[2022-12-09 21:06:54] <%Beulena> I saw someone make risotto by cleaning the rice and then saying, I like to add potato starch to make it thicker
[2022-12-09 21:07:51] <%Beulena> also risotto is Arborio rice, so it's a different kind of rice as well
