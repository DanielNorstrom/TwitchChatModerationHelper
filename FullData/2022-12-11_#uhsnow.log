[2022-12-11 14:19:18] <@%^StreamElements> There are bots currently going around Twitch whispering you about giveaways. These giveaways are a scam. DO NOT CLICK ANYTHING, just report them to Twitch and block them!
[2022-12-11 14:19:21] <+ItsFatRabbit> Turbo is honestly a one of the best things on twitch and they should advertise it more
[2022-12-11 14:19:48] <+McCape7> I think turbo is not as beneficial to twitch itself as other options. I do agree its the best value

[2022-12-11 14:36:33] <taylomic> 2 swaps Max imo
[2022-12-11 14:36:36] <%+GalovicV> kind of tiredness and burnout mix NODDERS

[2022-12-11 14:38:27] <ftlfearz> well at that point of chasing so much time after the car maybe start pitting much harder and dropping spikes?

[2022-12-11 14:43:03] <Houdaman> realistically criminals dont get away from the police 99% of the time, but how to balance that so both parties are having fun
[2022-12-11 14:43:04] <%SpectreUK> @Aus24 Yea things like that are a good idea instead of hard limitions
[2022-12-11 14:43:07] <%ArenaKrusher> @Aus24 remember when you cops used to shoot tires after 3 or so swaps that was wild, always thought that was a bit strange LUL
[2022-12-11 14:43:11] <%+RagingSantas> the mentality as a crim is do everything to get away so putting a hard limit is hard to justify but seems like the only thing.

[2022-12-11 14:43:19] <+KennyWolf> I remember i was in a server as a cop where in the SOPs it said chases can only last 15mins then cops have to break off.

[2022-12-11 14:43:32] <slampy15> @uhsnow why not just be like. "dear criminals if there are more than 3 swaps we will go hyper agrressive." like try to make it fun for both sides? its interesting
[2022-12-11 14:43:34] <%SpectreUK> smbsocal that wouldnt fix they would just swap to a car with more fuel

[2022-12-11 14:53:32] <slampy15> 3 different groups doing a 3 hour chase would be tiring
[2022-12-11 14:53:41] <Assigaru> Possible solution for lots of swaps. In crim group there can be only 6 members. But seeing theese kinda of boost it seems, that police focus all units on 1 of the cars and leave alone rest of the crims(if they are not shooting) to supply new cars, maybe police should also try more to catch others before that can happen, there seems to be enought units for it, becouse lots of times there is ~10 or so police cars focusing 1 or 2 of 6 crims(3-4 on main train, others parallel). Maybe i am mistaken.
