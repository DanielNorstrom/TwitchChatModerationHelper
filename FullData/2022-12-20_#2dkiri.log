[2022-12-20 13:39:27] <%BillFerShort> hello Kiri and chat kiriHi  how goes the fortress?
[2022-12-20 13:39:48] <Urzorn> In my last fort, all went well until a pretty mean monster came along and killed 85 dwarves, with about 30 more dying of their wounds. Everyone in my fort has PTSD.
[2022-12-20 13:39:49] <%Silvertunga> Ensorcelled is "has had a spell (sorcery)  put upon it". As in a certain lady who took a bite out of an apple and fell into a magical sleep and was put into a glass casket crafted by dwarves!
[2022-12-20 13:39:49] <icosaeder> Yes I think we could commemorate the poor wombat :(
[2022-12-20 13:40:04] <Urzorn> Likely dead then. yes.
[2022-12-20 13:40:16] <tronman3000> Do you remember the game where you lived in a small room and you made food and coffee in a kitchen? you also fought orcs. but it was very dark and they were hard to find.
[2022-12-20 13:40:34] VIEWERS: 252
[2022-12-20 13:40:40] <Urzorn> Others also have infighting, so the troll might have died to the Kobolds for instance.

[2022-12-20 13:41:25] <tronman3000> I'm sure trolls eat rats. So you could let a few roam around. But definitely kill them if they get too close.

[2022-12-20 13:54:56] <arrioch_> Hello
[2022-12-20 13:55:04] <+rocket_on_rotor> I have schadenfreude seing you wrestle with z lvl and the caverns. I am in the same boat. Seems like the 1st cavern is particularly rough
[2022-12-20 13:55:11] <%+ListlessOnion> You need to be able to stand next to the tile you want to build on
[2022-12-20 13:55:23] <!%TheMoenia> stair would work i think
[2022-12-20 13:55:26] <%$CarloTheCurious> a closed door blocks the whole square. So long as the square above isn't clear it will block passge even for fliers (unless they knock it down)
[2022-12-20 13:55:45] <Urzorn> @CarloTheCurious She has 2 z levels of air.
[2022-12-20 13:56:00] <%$CarloTheCurious> ah, right. I find it hard to tell on this new fangled "graphical" version ;p
[2022-12-20 13:56:06] <%+ListlessOnion> No because the ramp only gets you this level to a valid tile you can stand on... there is no such thing there
[2022-12-20 13:56:31] <Urzorn> Alternatively: You could also build hatches and put them on your stairs on the top.
[2022-12-20 13:56:41] VIEWERS: 281
[2022-12-20 13:56:54] <%+ListlessOnion> in other words, a ramp is only valid if built against a solid wall, then it gets you on top of that wall
[2022-12-20 13:57:46] <+crazyhobbitman> The second floor stairs haven't finished yet.
[2022-12-20 13:57:49] <%$CarloTheCurious> you won't have access until the stairs are built

[2022-12-20 13:59:32] <Urzorn> @TheMoenia They should be able too, as long as you have set them to take these metal equipments.
[2022-12-20 13:59:44] <Calamity_Kyle> I love how Dwarf Fortress looked like an impenetrable fortress of a game when it DIDN'T have graphics, and now that it does have them... I'm not sure it feels any more approachable LUL

[2022-12-20 14:03:18] <kylania> You can raise the priority of Work Orders, but it's a lot of blue arrow clicking to get it to the top.  There needs to be a 'Move to Top' button, for sure!

[2022-12-20 14:18:05] <Urzorn> So, wood bolts are *really* bad at killing stuff, even small animals. In my game, because of the wooden bolts, my hunter kept running around just seriously injuring animals, and then letting them get away because he ran out of ammo.

[2022-12-20 14:33:01] <Calamity_Kyle> if it's fuzzy, it's because the zoom is imperfect (i.e. not an integer) and the pixel art is likely not baked into the game upscaled. common problem.

[2022-12-20 14:39:37] <Urzorn> I was gonna say: You seem to play very conservatively. And I get wanting to do that, I often do the same, but keep in mind: it's quite easy in DF to keep going forever by being careful. You want to play a little risky from time to time, to give things a chance to go very wrong.

[2022-12-20 14:47:04] <+Jaetonik> If you eat them raw, you DO get a seed from it
[2022-12-20 14:47:05] <+crazyhobbitman> You have a lot of plump helmets. You probably just haven't made any drinks from them lately to get more seeds.
[2022-12-20 14:47:06] <%$CarloTheCurious> have you actually run out, or are the seeds in a bag/bin some dwarf is currently using?
[2022-12-20 14:47:14] <starryeyeddemongirl> you do jaet?
[2022-12-20 14:47:17] <%$codihunden> i ran out aswell, no idea why
[2022-12-20 14:47:19] <Urzorn> You probably have a bunch of plump helmets in stock, that are not brewed yet. So you have no seeds.
[2022-12-20 14:47:19] <+Jaetonik> No, they don't eat the seed. lol
[2022-12-20 14:47:20] <liverd> Were they brewed? Or arethey sitting somewhere?
[2022-12-20 14:47:21] <digitaladam123> Plump helmets have electrolytes
[2022-12-20 14:47:28] <holdenjack> And seeds in barrels aren't accesible for planting
[2022-12-20 14:47:31] <Fortunos> check the places menu (capital P) and then the farmplots
[2022-12-20 14:47:56] <+Jaetonik> @starryeyeddemongirl But yes, you do get a single seed back from eating them raw. :)

[2022-12-20 14:49:08] <starryeyeddemongirl> you need a guineacock to get babbies, thats literally wehat its called .-.
[2022-12-20 14:49:10] <+Jaetonik> yes

[2022-12-20 14:49:16] <+TelinArtho> well fowl are all good to have around anyway
[2022-12-20 14:49:20] <+Jaetonik> As long as you have a Nest Box for the Hen
[2022-12-20 14:49:26] <+crazyhobbitman> It will still lay eggs in a nest box.
[2022-12-20 14:49:35] <liverd> Turkeys are awesome, they lay like 12 eggs in average
[2022-12-20 14:49:40] <holdenjack> @codihunden to fix it, you have to dump the items in the barrel, then reclaim the bags
[2022-12-20 14:49:54] <+Jaetonik> oo, spiffy

[2022-12-20 14:50:18] <aarpia> She can have a holiday home
[2022-12-20 14:50:21] <+Jaetonik> you only need the number of nest boxes as you have female birds

[2022-12-20 14:52:21] <+crazyhobbitman> You have to check in the civilization screen. In the bottom right.

[2022-12-20 14:53:36] <OrangeSims> yeah, the information is guess work without the wiki in so many cases
[2022-12-20 14:53:51] <L1ONl> the devs said they might even add animations eventually
[2022-12-20 14:54:17] <%$Krypsyn> The DF learning curve is an issue.  The training wheels have been on back order for over a decade.
[2022-12-20 14:54:19] <Urzorn> It's missing some features, like telling archers to train with wooden bolts, but use regular bolts for fighting.
[2022-12-20 14:54:32] <Urzorn> Ghosties are friends.
[2022-12-20 14:54:35] <Urzorn> :D
[2022-12-20 14:54:42] <%agravicvoid> If you don’t have a body to put in a coffin, you make a stone slab, then engrave a memorial on the slab and place it
[2022-12-20 14:54:45] <tronman3000> do the dwarfs pray to any GODS? It  would be fun to set up a temple where dwarves sacrifice food and other resources at an altar under a giant Dwarf GOD statue
[2022-12-20 14:54:46] <%+Flopsidoodle_> Dead dwarf?
[2022-12-20 14:54:51] VIEWERS: 551
[2022-12-20 14:54:54] <aarpia> Is the slab engraved?
[2022-12-20 14:55:23] <Urzorn> So: burials need a coffin *or* a slab, not both. But you can do both. If you want to put a slab, you need to go to a stone worker first, and engrave it.
[2022-12-20 14:55:24] <%agravicvoid> Spooky scary dwarf ghost
[2022-12-20 14:55:29] <Fortunos> gotta engrave before you place it
[2022-12-20 14:55:33] <icosaeder> No thoughts. Hed emty.
[2022-12-20 14:55:41] <Drygyn> Have to engrave the slab first
[2022-12-20 14:55:49] <aarpia> You'll need to engrave the slab at a mason's or craftdwarf shop, can't remember which, with a specific memorial
[2022-12-20 14:55:54] <%agravicvoid> “Return the slab or suffer my curse!” LOL
[2022-12-20 14:56:00] <%$Krypsyn> @Urzorn Yeah.  In the classic version, at least there were tons of mods for QoL.  I am sure they will be ported to this version eventually (might take a few months).
[2022-12-20 14:56:25] <icosaeder> Yeah as long as one finger lingers somewhere in the caverns ... they might some back to haunt you.
[2022-12-20 14:56:29] <aarpia> Can't do it through the manager window, have to do it on the workshop
[2022-12-20 14:56:29] <%$codihunden> stoneworker
[2022-12-20 14:56:31] <digitaladam123> go to craft shop

[2022-12-20 14:57:26] <Urzorn> It says Ghost. :P
[2022-12-20 14:57:51] <aarpia> IF you have the body you can just bury it that's fine
[2022-12-20 14:57:53] <Urzorn> The body will still be around.
[2022-12-20 14:57:54] <Fortunos> if the body is available burying it in a coffin works
[2022-12-20 14:58:02] <+Jaetonik> The ghost jut means that it wasn't buried.
[2022-12-20 14:58:03] <aarpia> Slabs are for when you have lava accidents and such
[2022-12-20 14:58:05] <holdenjack> If you have the body, just the coffin will put them to rest
[2022-12-20 14:58:11] <Fortunos> the slabs are for when your dwarves aren't reachable anymore (drowning in your well, lava, etc.)
[2022-12-20 14:58:13] <digitaladam123> Ghosts are appeased when their remains at put in a coffin, or a slab that has been engraved for them has been built.
[2022-12-20 14:58:15] <Urzorn> Slabs are basically if something happened to the corpse and you lost it (it fell in magma, or a deep lake)
[2022-12-20 14:58:20] <Rogxu> just the coffin, mark it as a tomb and they will use it
[2022-12-20 14:58:21] [Points] rizzy_69 redeemed Lurker Hello (117)
[2022-12-20 14:58:46] <Urzorn> The tomb zone works a bit different. you want to make a 1x1 zone around the coffin.
[2022-12-20 14:58:51] <Fortunos> tombs need to be marked per-grave, not as a shared hall
[2022-12-20 14:58:53] <Fortunos> it's finnicky
[2022-12-20 14:58:58] VIEWERS: 571
[2022-12-20 14:58:59] <Urzorn> Or else this entire tomb is just for this one dwarf.
[2022-12-20 14:59:00] <Rogxu> yea unfortunately each coffin needs to have its own tomb mark

[2022-12-20 14:59:27] <subparumpire> By tomb they mean the specific tomb of that dwarf, its one coffin per tomb (so small rooms)
[2022-12-20 14:59:40] <%$dominikh> let's try
[2022-12-20 14:59:43] <+Jaetonik> it gives them a tomb for before they die

[2022-12-20 14:59:44] <liverd> You can assign them a coffin

[2022-12-20 14:59:57] <Drygyn> No - you set the tomb for them, for when they do pass on
[2022-12-20 14:59:58] <+crazyhobbitman> You cannot entomb someone who is still alive. It just designates ownership of the tomb.

[2022-12-20 15:00:15] <Rogxu> nah thats for the nobles like Egyptian Pharaohs.. they want their tombs to be organised before death
[2022-12-20 15:00:23] <aarpia> You can assign tombs to the living like they're pharaohs or some shit
[2022-12-20 15:00:33] <Fortunos> if you leave it unspecific, it'll get claimed by any dwarf that needs burial right now (like bedrooms)

[2022-12-20 15:21:54] <subparumpire> You can build a well on the level above water (the empty space above it) and then they can draw from that
[2022-12-20 15:21:55] <+President_Bulldog> dont breach
[2022-12-20 15:22:05] <+Carkan> prolly will flood everything below it
[2022-12-20 15:22:09] <Rogxu> 7 is max, the whole block is water basically
[2022-12-20 15:22:13] <+President_Bulldog> you gather water from surface unless you wanna fill that stair w water
[2022-12-20 15:22:44] <+President_Bulldog> 7 bits of water in the cell
[2022-12-20 15:22:46] <subparumpire> The z level is filled 7/7
[2022-12-20 15:22:51] <Rogxu> that specific block is 7/7 water

[2022-12-20 15:22:52] <+Jaetonik> If you can see the deepness of the water then you are under the water :) (rather on the same Z level. It fills the whole Z level
[2022-12-20 15:22:54] <+toon2k> 7 deep means the cell is full of water

Due to the "rider" making decisions, the mother and baby would die as the baby made the decisions on where mother would go and what they would do. Meaning they'd run around playing and crying.
[2022-12-20 15:41:53] <%+Flopsidoodle_> I read that it's a good idea to restrict soldier positions to males dwarves as females have a tendency to carry their babies into battle, is that still a thing?

[2022-12-20 15:46:13] <+IamCaffy> they sleep with their axe.... not weird at all
[2022-12-20 15:46:30] <Rogxu> sleeping in barrack?

[2022-12-20 15:46:39] <subparumpire> Is he sleeping in the barracks? If its a multi bed room its not considered a "proper room"

[2022-12-20 15:46:47] <subparumpire> Proper room being a private bedroom
[2022-12-20 15:47:00] <+MadHattersteaparty> dwarves need their personal space
[2022-12-20 15:47:00] <LandosLair> Proper room has a door, bed, chest/coffer, and cabinet
[2022-12-20 15:47:06] <!%TheMoenia> time for the good ole 1x3 bedroom
[2022-12-20 15:47:12] <+Ends_Of_Invention> maybe he's embaressed because everyone saw him sleeping with the axe

[2022-12-20 15:47:50] <icosaeder> I think the idea is that being in barracks is SUPPOSED to make dwarves unhappy. Therefore rotating shifts.
[2022-12-20 15:48:27] <+MadHattersteaparty> what are the angry dwarves unhappy about?

[2022-12-20 15:50:10] <+TheEggBeard> Soap Fact: The production of Soap is the earliest known record of a chemical reaction, 4,500 years ago when Babylonians heated a mixture of oil and wood ash, for washing clothing.

[2022-12-20 15:51:26] <Rogxu> only on year 2 so far :)
[2022-12-20 15:51:32] <+TheEggBeard> I had a Tantrumming Child hold off a Goblin Invasion using a Rock Toy Boat long enough for the military to arrive. That child was a life saver.

[2022-12-20 15:51:39] <SillyZili> Tantrum spiral is when a dwarf gets killed/dies and negatively affects the mood of other Dwaves, which make them go into a mood and die.. So on and so on :D

[2022-12-20 15:53:42] <+TheEggBeard> According to the Wiki you can make the walls of your fort out of Soap as a handy way to store it without using stockpile space. Then if you run out of soap, you can deconstruct your fortress and wash yourself with it.
[2022-12-20 15:53:56] <SillyZili> @TheMoenia Hope not haha
[2022-12-20 15:53:57] <icosaeder> You got madhattersteaparty and we got six arms on this snowflake baby!

[2022-12-20 15:54:40] <%$CarloTheCurious> what was the question?
[2022-12-20 15:54:40] <SillyZili> They'll fill chests with the soap
[2022-12-20 15:54:42] <Rogxu> check the zone of hospital
[2022-12-20 15:54:44] <+TheEggBeard> Soap needs a stockpile near water source, but will automatically be stored in hospital chests
[2022-12-20 15:54:45] <+crazyhobbitman> You put it in the chest in your hospital.
[2022-12-20 15:54:47] <SillyZili> You can adjust the amount if you want in the zone settings
[2022-12-20 15:54:51] <!%+Wrinxz> Kiri, all I have been told is you don't drop the soap. Hope that helps! Kappa

[2022-12-20 15:54:51] <starryeyeddemongirl> They'll take it themselves and storee it in the chest placed in the hospital
[2022-12-20 15:54:51] <DadGamerC> If you have soap, and you have chests in the hospital, the dwarves will automatically move it there
[2022-12-20 15:54:52] <holdenjack> have chest in hospital, they will sotre it there
[2022-12-20 15:55:01] <%$CarloTheCurious> Hospital will take some soap automaticaly, I believe (if it has chests)
[2022-12-20 15:55:03] <rhyzian> isn't it automatic in the hospital chest?

[2022-12-20 15:55:22] <+TheEggBeard> I have a water source with soap stored near it, and the water source is close to the hospital. Means Dwarves can use soap for baths, and it's not too far for hospital to restock soap from either.
[2022-12-20 15:55:23] <Rogxu> check the zone
[2022-12-20 15:55:24] <%$CarloTheCurious> If you want more soap elsewhere (e.g. for a bathhouse), you'd need a stockpile
[2022-12-20 15:55:29] <Rogxu> you can define how much you want
[2022-12-20 15:55:31] <+crazyhobbitman> Shared tales will update information on artifacts on the world map.
[2022-12-20 15:55:32] <subparumpire> Probably somewhere on the map under the rumors section, I find it hard to navigate but you can check rumors from all over the world on the global map
[2022-12-20 15:55:33] <!%TheMoenia> you should be able to see in the zone menu of the hospital i think kiri
[2022-12-20 15:55:37] <+AbeBRs> If there a limit on how much can be stored in a chest?
[2022-12-20 15:55:47] <+TheEggBeard> In your Stocks, Soap shows under "Bars/Blocks"
[2022-12-20 15:55:55] <%$CarloTheCurious> if you go to the hospital zone and then the magnifying glass it should show what the hospital has and wants

[2022-12-20 16:06:12] <+TheEggBeard> 5 bars of your soap will be good for like 750 washes

[2022-12-20 16:11:07] <Rogxu> (hit magnify)
[2022-12-20 16:11:15] <+crazyhobbitman> It's best to make the melt object task from a specific smelter if you have more than one because most objects smelt to a fraction of a bar and only make a bar when they get to 100%
[2022-12-20 16:11:17] <+TheEggBeard> It's forbidden as shot ammunition is auto forbidden to stop dwarves collecting it during fights.

[2022-12-20 16:23:03] <+TheEggBeard> I think they fender the fat automatically.
[2022-12-20 16:23:23] <+TheEggBeard> I've never had to create work orders to render fat and I've got more soap than you can shake a stick at.
[2022-12-20 16:23:24] <Kynikos197> i think they try to cook tallow by default so you might have to tell them not to
[2022-12-20 16:23:27] <+crazyhobbitman> Do you have an empty bucket?
[2022-12-20 16:23:29] VIEWERS: 614
[2022-12-20 16:23:30] <Rogxu> check the soap maker and watch if the job gets picked up .. or since you did it as a work order maybe the manager just hasnt had the time to approve it yet
[2022-12-20 16:23:34] <SillyZili> Soap feels a bit dodge in this version so far to me, I haven't been able to make any in my fortresses
[2022-12-20 16:23:46] <SillyZili> Just assumed I screwed up somewhere
[2022-12-20 16:24:20] <+TheEggBeard> Just have Butcher Shop and Ash from a wood furnace, get the furnace to produce Lye, then butcher animal. Fat will happen automatically.
[2022-12-20 16:24:31] <+crazyhobbitman> Fletching.
[2022-12-20 16:24:51] <+TheEggBeard> Once The Soap Maker Has Fat and Lye, it will produce soap

[2022-12-20 16:26:12] <+TheEggBeard> You need a Kitchen for fat to render, but it will do it automatically, just like how the loom spins automatically.
[2022-12-20 16:26:26] <+TheEggBeard> check the kitchen, what is stored in it?

[2022-12-20 16:28:24] <+crazyhobbitman> I think it wants more than two barrels of lye not more than two units of lye.
[2022-12-20 16:28:46] <!Belannaer> I did the same, plus my first fort was bugged
[2022-12-20 16:28:57] <+TheEggBeard> If you don't like wombat soap, you can also press oil from seeds... if you want vegan dwarves
[2022-12-20 16:29:14] <ZaZiiZu> it was a suggested condition. i probably would've clicked that, too
[2022-12-20 16:29:15] <!Belannaer> my crash issue was fixed, it was in the patch notes

[2022-12-20 16:30:58] <+CathodeRayTube> The necromancers that emigrated to my fort resurected the victims and killed it I think.
[2022-12-20 16:31:01] <!Belannaer> If you have beds they put wounded dwarves on the beds
[2022-12-20 16:31:18] <+AvatarGW> they will stay int he bed if you have them
[2022-12-20 16:31:24] <+IamCaffy> you want a table and beds
[2022-12-20 16:31:24] <+crazyhobbitman> You need the table
[2022-12-20 16:31:25] <hypatian_kat> Beds give them a place to recuperate. The table is for operating.
