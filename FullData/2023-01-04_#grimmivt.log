[2023-01-04 05:27:10] <%RomeoEchoDelta> Hinata literally only exists to be Naruto's love interest. She has no God damn character.

[2023-01-04 06:34:35] <%RomeoEchoDelta> O'Hare feels like a mall
[2023-01-04 06:34:35] <%+ItzMochaa> being in an airport when nobody is there is a crazy experience
[2023-01-04 06:34:40] <@%Extrafuzzy> It stopped being liminal for me
[2023-01-04 06:34:45] <!%GinjiVitis> I find some weird peace from airports. like i always feel at ease in them.
[2023-01-04 06:34:46] <%spades_chan> airports always feel liminal especially if you're flights been delayed a lot and you have to stay overnight
[2023-01-04 06:34:47] <%$Tempest_52> Airports are also weird because you also seem to always be there at like 5 am
[2023-01-04 06:34:48] <%$eleni_afk> I never like rooms with no windows.. grimmi14OHNO
[2023-01-04 06:34:49] <$RinzaiGigen> @zeromatter21 ???
[2023-01-04 06:34:55] <%LoremasterofSotek> I always think of the time I was driving through the Texas Panhandle, which is INSANELY empty. Miles of nothing but dirt, no people or buildings for miles and miles. And then a fog rolled in that brought my visibility to about 5 feet and the radio stations ceased working. Was NOT a fan
[2023-01-04 06:34:55] <%Lareolan> Airports are fine
[2023-01-04 06:35:01] <!%socialistOtter> they aren't meant to be comfortable
[2023-01-04 06:35:02] <thatstringfellow> that might be the anxiety
[2023-01-04 06:35:03] <josea9864> what is that weirdly built airport in America?

[2023-01-04 06:35:33] <!%socialistOtter> making you comfortable is the opposite of what an airport wants, they want you to leave
[2023-01-04 06:35:37] <%zeromatter21> @RinzaiGigen Go look at them. Peak cool ps1 skyboxes

[2023-01-04 06:35:54] <!%GinjiVitis> i get nothing but peace from airports. something about the structure of it. its like one big machine. like being in an ant colony. i dont know.
[2023-01-04 06:36:02] <$RinzaiGigen> ALSO the title of an essay by Camus.
[2023-01-04 06:36:07] <%+nachtigalfinn> You know, the most creepy liminal places though are the everyday familiar ones when they are totally empty. Like your school, or a busy street in your city.

[2023-01-04 07:38:46] <$RinzaiGigen> That's a Heideggerian concept, which influenced the design of *Scorn*.
[2023-01-04 07:38:53] <!%Prof_PavloVT> Ever watch Bojack Horseman?  There's a dumb uninsightful really positive character named Mr. Peanutbutter.  At one point he says "Life is full of little distractions, then you die" and it's like, oh, he's coping as much as we are.
[2023-01-04 07:38:58] <%Pond_water> I kind of like existing, though. The squelching flesh bag that is a body is kind of great.
[2023-01-04 07:39:11] <SketchingChaos> heyo everyone
[2023-01-04 07:39:11] <%supersweethoneybunny> "Now, until the moment you die." type of moment.
[2023-01-04 07:39:14] <JayBusch> There's an older comic I remember seeing basically describing this, everyone has a hole in them that needs to be filled. Some people pick work, some religion, but basically if you don't have something to give you meaning or distract yourself, you basically go crazy.

[2023-01-04 07:39:59] <Sardonic_scout> @jaybusch do you remember the name?
[2023-01-04 07:40:04] <@%Extrafuzzy> I fill the hole in my life with vtubers and cereal
[2023-01-04 07:40:05] <%King__Froggo> isn't this a major plot point in Evangelion
[2023-01-04 07:40:11] <!%socialistOtter> fill the hole with vtuber
[2023-01-04 07:40:22] <JayBusch> @Sardonic_scout Unfortunately no, I think it was just a basic webcomic.
[2023-01-04 07:40:32] <+Misterrr_P> Yeah I write to fill mine
[2023-01-04 07:40:36] <$RinzaiGigen> @King__Froggo Yeah, during Instrumentality.

[2023-01-04 07:40:51] <!%GinjiVitis> vtubing and making vtuber friends has been really therapeutic

[2023-01-04 07:43:59] <@%Extrafuzzy> 600+ pages with no Mpreg grimmi. Sure you can handle it?
[2023-01-04 07:44:00] <!%Prof_PavloVT> I'd be calling a university
[2023-01-04 07:44:03] <%Pond_water> Illegal room building!

[2023-01-04 07:44:31] <Free4563> Highly recommend reading it with a nearby closet door open for maximum effect LUL
[2023-01-04 07:44:39] <+Misterrr_P> nah I get scared by jumpscares but my radiator having one extra pipe leading to it will wig me out

[2023-01-04 07:45:06] <+fogcloud_> @free4563 I was scared enough with a solid wall behind me at the end of it
[2023-01-04 07:45:07] <!%GinjiVitis> I found a game that makes me want to do an mpreg stream
[2023-01-04 07:45:09] <ArchRogue_> for when you crave the void
[2023-01-04 07:45:12] <%supersweethoneybunny> nope, uh-uh. would not go.
[2023-01-04 07:45:18] <GreaseChimp> celiHi Hi Grimmi
[2023-01-04 07:45:27] <%King__Froggo> i like how this is all read so it's extra scawey
[2023-01-04 07:45:32] <%Edibleghost> he's describing a public library
[2023-01-04 07:45:35] <%King__Froggo> red*
[2023-01-04 07:45:36] <!%Prof_PavloVT> OMG GRIMMI.  Have you seen Occulus?  It's a horror movie about a mirror that takes control of your mind.  It's insanely good.
[2023-01-04 07:45:43] <%Pond_water> Somehow, he doesn't do what I would do, which is take a saw to the doorframe and wall to see what happens.

[2023-01-04 07:45:54] <$RinzaiGigen> BTW House of Blue Leaves is a decent play.
[2023-01-04 07:46:02] <%TheAussieGiant> the book is so choppy and strange that you'll forget all these spoilers
[2023-01-04 07:46:08] <%Pond_water> ^
[2023-01-04 07:46:12] <@%Extrafuzzy> I would sell the house. Think of the value! Infinite square feet
[2023-01-04 07:46:20] <%SlipMcDrip> Why don't they just leave?
[2023-01-04 07:46:23] <%Pond_water> This does not do the book justice, structurally.
[2023-01-04 07:46:31] <!%Prof_PavloVT> At that point you donate the house to a university physics department who then contacts the department of defense and let them figure it out.
[2023-01-04 07:46:36] <hellfire_5k> Hi
[2023-01-04 07:46:37] <$RinzaiGigen> @Extrafuzzy It would destroy the housing market, though.
[2023-01-04 07:46:45] <!%GinjiVitis> this guy's B-roll  is so on point

[2023-01-04 10:11:58] <@%Extrafuzzy> do not grimmi14Bigeyes
[2023-01-04 10:11:58] <%RomeoEchoDelta> Not that part, just the sheer pessimism of the song overall.
[2023-01-04 10:12:02] <syoxiss> oh nice too ppl, i was just gonna hug my cat, but i can try being nice to ppl....
[2023-01-04 10:12:10] <syoxiss> its a joke btw
[2023-01-04 10:12:31] <thatstringfellow> is it pessimism though? It's more like positive nihilism
[2023-01-04 10:12:32] <@%Extrafuzzy> that one is a different vibe
[2023-01-04 10:12:40] <syoxiss> i always try to be nice..

[2023-01-04 10:12:52] <%LoremasterofSotek> Yeah I’d say that was positive nihilism
[2023-01-04 10:12:52] <$RinzaiGigen> @thatstringfellow Yeah, that's why it feels dumb.
[2023-01-04 10:13:16] <!%socialistOtter> ehhhh
[2023-01-04 10:13:45] <%solidoutlaw> oh I love this artist

[2023-01-04 10:13:57] <$RinzaiGigen> @LoremasterofSotek That's why I think that sort of thing just turns me off; it feels passive-aggressive when it's just a coping mechanism for a lack of meaning in one's life.
[2023-01-04 10:14:18] <!%socialistOtter> 'all of my friends are in love with that shark' is it because he's like 9 feet tall
[2023-01-04 10:14:19] <@%Extrafuzzy> I'm gonna head to bed ina bit batatYee  already past 4 here
[2023-01-04 10:14:30] <@%Extrafuzzy> you need me to do anything before i'm off?

[2023-01-04 10:15:16] <$RinzaiGigen> Well, I don't condone either approach, on principle.
[2023-01-04 10:15:24] <!%socialistOtter> I think it's more complicated than 'just be nice'
[2023-01-04 10:15:24] <jinx_the_sphinx_> Empathy without boundaries is self destruction :)
[2023-01-04 10:15:55] <$Corvus_The_Greedy> Link have no game koriWheeze
[2023-01-04 10:15:56] <$RinzaiGigen> @jinx_the_sphinx_ I concur, absolutely.
[2023-01-04 10:15:58] <maruyamayuki_vt> his profile is just hyah. big mood.
[2023-01-04 10:16:03] <@%Extrafuzzy> dont sacrifice your own happiness and well being for others
[2023-01-04 10:16:06] <syoxiss> kyunHeadpat
[2023-01-04 10:16:17] <$RinzaiGigen> Right. I would not force it. I'm nice to Grimmi because she's a good parsley.
[2023-01-04 10:16:31] <!%socialistOtter> @Extrafuzzy a lot of people will not return that energy! it's dangerous
[2023-01-04 10:16:52] <%LoremasterofSotek> There’s an important lesson to be found in kindness for its own sake. But don’t mistake being kind for being a doormat, you need to be kind to yourself as well
[2023-01-04 10:16:52] <$RinzaiGigen> @Extrafuzzy Oh, that's fine. LUL Just don't be a flatterer.

[2023-01-04 10:17:27] <@%Extrafuzzy> Yea, Until a few years ago i had a history of giving too much to people that didnt deserve it
[2023-01-04 10:17:43] <$RinzaiGigen> @Extrafuzzy who hasn't, here?
[2023-01-04 10:17:48] <egoautemaeternumquodsolum> he tried to catch her face lmao
[2023-01-04 10:17:50] <MeowHong> Well, aren't light hair genes generally recessive?

[2023-01-04 10:17:57] <$Corvus_The_Greedy> She was about to fall so he tried to catch her
[2023-01-04 10:18:00] <%GamingBleach_> guess one of them have to stop Existing to solve that problem
[2023-01-04 10:18:00] <%MoonStorm3d> smooth
[2023-01-04 10:18:05] <$RinzaiGigen> @MeowHong That explains why they're so shy. SeriousSloth
[2023-01-04 10:18:07] <%+Azlehria> I try to be impersonally polite to anyone I encounter. It helps a bit when I deal with someone I really WANT to be nice to for no reason.
[2023-01-04 10:18:17] <some_guy1729> He's ready for the goblin not social situations.
[2023-01-04 10:18:32] <$RinzaiGigen> @Azlehria Yes, I try to be formal until I feel comfortable, personally.
[2023-01-04 10:18:42] <!%voltchuckleflumpkinsbunny> You can, it just wouldn't help
[2023-01-04 10:18:48] <%RomeoEchoDelta> You can actually, you'll just get arrested.

[2023-01-04 10:19:45] <!%$Prof_PavloVT> Can confirm.  Had an hour long buss ride to school (lived in a rural area) growing up.
[2023-01-04 10:19:45] <!%socialistOtter> hang out forever!
[2023-01-04 10:19:45] <%LoremasterofSotek> I’m going back to sleep
[2023-01-04 10:19:50] <%RomeoEchoDelta> It was very fun but you need to be a human
[2023-01-04 10:19:51] <%+Azlehria> @rinzaigigen Increased familiarity often reduces my comfort level. Anxiety about dealing with a stranger is replaced with anxiety about screwing up a positive relationship.
