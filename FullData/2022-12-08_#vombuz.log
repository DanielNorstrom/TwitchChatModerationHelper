[2022-12-08 14:41:06] <%+klingin14> maybe only bounty allows extraction unless you banish which gives some immunity. Encourages people to play the objective then.

[2022-12-08 15:33:44] <%petestojic5> The oled actually gives u the total black, that means the pixel switch off when the colour in the picture is black
[2022-12-08 15:34:00] <%ameg> OLED also tends to have screen burn
[2022-12-08 15:34:01] <%+PigGeneral> oleds are the JAM

[2022-12-08 15:34:26] <%+PigGeneral> the oled pixels have a lifespan, they def die out over time.
[2022-12-08 15:34:27] <%ballbag971> i think TVs are so good nowadays that you dont really notice the difference between qled and oled if you arent an expert in it

[2022-12-08 15:34:31] <%+PigGeneral> the picture quality tho....
[2022-12-08 15:34:34] <%ameg> yeah
[2022-12-08 15:34:48] <%ameg> it all comes down to how much you are gonna use the TV
[2022-12-08 15:35:03] <%+PigGeneral> if you are gonna use the display for SPREADSHEETS
[2022-12-08 15:35:06] <%+PigGeneral> don't get an oled
[2022-12-08 15:35:15] <%+PigGeneral> but if it's primarily for media consumption, it's money well spent
[2022-12-08 15:35:21] <%+PigGeneral> even if you replace the monitor a little sooner
[2022-12-08 15:35:38] <%ballbag971> i'd say if you like the ambilight just go for the tv with the ambilight
[2022-12-08 15:35:40] <%ameg> you are not gonna play in it?

[2022-12-08 15:38:12] <%+PigGeneral> oled monitors aren't bad, as long as you are aware of the use case
[2022-12-08 15:38:18] <%+PigGeneral> you need to stick to media consumption
[2022-12-08 15:38:25] <%+PigGeneral> do not work on it with a text editor or spreadsheets all day
[2022-12-08 15:38:29] <%+PigGeneral> you will get grid lines and shit

[2022-12-08 15:39:20] <%ameg> yeah, that's screen burn
[2022-12-08 15:39:23] <%ameg> nono, that happens
[2022-12-08 15:39:39] <%ameg> stuff you have in a set place for a long period it will happen
[2022-12-08 15:39:48] <%ameg> I had it happening to a phone xD
[2022-12-08 15:40:04] VIEWERS: 330
[2022-12-08 15:40:06] <%ameg> idk how much they've worked on OLED tvs to prevent that
[2022-12-08 15:40:23] <%+PigGeneral> oled tvs are pretty robust ameg, unless you leave it on like cnn or something where it has the news ticker at the bottom
[2022-12-08 15:40:23] <MSRitschi> but that would only happen if you never open the map in 45 min probably
[2022-12-08 15:40:30] <%+PigGeneral> and you have to really abuse it
[2022-12-08 15:40:56] <%ameg> I mean, I think my new phone has OLED too and I haven't seen burn yet
[2022-12-08 15:40:58] <%+PigGeneral> and im talking normal tv lifespan, do people really keep their sets for 8+ years?
[2022-12-08 15:41:04] <bombermangg> Thing is, not only Hunt, but most games have some kind of fixed text/info in the screen all times, so its probably bad for most of then
[2022-12-08 15:41:10] <%ameg> so maybe they've found a way to fix it
[2022-12-08 15:41:24] <%ameg> but in my old s8 I had the keyboard there xD

[2022-12-08 15:41:40] <%+PigGeneral> maybe if you play just the 1 game, exclusively to all others, it could be a problem. they have a wear-leveling thing too
[2022-12-08 15:41:45] <%ameg> I don't change it unless it's broken
[2022-12-08 15:41:54] <%ameg> but my phone went bad in a year
[2022-12-08 15:42:03] <%ameg> I do use my PC way more than TV
[2022-12-08 15:42:05] VIEWERS: 339
[2022-12-08 15:42:11] <%+PigGeneral> i think if the display makes it 5+ years, with how much you stare at it
[2022-12-08 15:42:15] <%+PigGeneral> you got your money's worth
[2022-12-08 15:42:15] <%ameg> I can see desktop bar burning in the monitor
[2022-12-08 15:42:35] <%ameg> I don't think that should be a good way of thinking honestly pig
[2022-12-08 15:42:43] <%ameg> I feel things should last more if you treat them well

[2022-12-08 15:44:03] <%+PigGeneral> i'll usually move inside of 5-8 years, and a 70+ inch tv is too big a pain to move

[2022-12-08 16:56:49] <@%BlackHairVioletEyes> @Helionos01 for me, its the more "competitive" style. like because its more competitive, i want to be confident in the new stuffs before more new stuffs. if that makes sense
[2022-12-08 16:56:53] <Arosco> i love the new content, but i think theyll really need to focus optimization soon

[2022-12-08 17:52:20] <%Mr_Melledork> Hunt is less of a game that focuses on aim. Sure it helps to have great aim. But most of the time it comes down to position and strategy.

[2022-12-08 20:40:35] <%BotStik> the best thing about Hunt is PvP, so new bosses have little effect on that, new map has a big effect on that

[2022-12-08 20:41:10] <@%KainMugrol> maybe the goal of fighting boss and expecting it to be more challenging and different than others...
[2022-12-08 20:41:12] <akzar2020> roaming boss would be cool, even if it's just outside the buildings.

[2022-12-08 20:41:53] <%BotStik> they could make a meathead variant instead of roaming boss honestly

[2022-12-08 20:50:29] <%alkosam> isnt it lower if he dies by two stars
[2022-12-08 20:50:30] <%+professor_phobos> i play sloppy in quickplay to rush the wellspring for cash, and even I don't die enough to derank
[2022-12-08 20:50:35] <DrunkenSnail> @Baconlitheque You are right
[2022-12-08 20:50:36] <%$Baconlitheque> if you kill high rank it goes up more, if you die to low rank it goes down more i believe
[2022-12-08 20:50:38] <+Marathon_Pro> if someone lower than you kills it drops MORE
[2022-12-08 20:50:41] <17nugget> if you kill him, his elo will  drop less bc ur higher no
[2022-12-08 20:50:43] <DoomGuyI_I> yes, if he died to you it registers your far better than him so he stays the same
[2022-12-08 20:50:51] <%bongocat_0090> if 1 star gets killed by 6 star they gain mmr vombuzKEKW
[2022-12-08 20:50:58] <%alkosam> two or one,lower than his :D
[2022-12-08 20:51:02] <DrunkenSnail> Also he wasted time
[2022-12-08 20:51:03] <%$Baconlitheque> if 1 star kills 6 star they probably go straight to 4 LUL
[2022-12-08 20:51:05] <DoomGuyI_I> yes, it's still funny. he wasted more time too
[2022-12-08 20:51:05] <DrunkenSnail> most important part
[2022-12-08 20:51:06] <%Scitmen> @bongocat_0090 vombuzKEKW vombuzKEKW
[2022-12-08 20:51:23] <%melchior037> as a 3 star, you're expected to die to a 5 star, so dying to them will not drop. If he consistently dies to 3star, he's not "at that level" and gets dropped more

[2022-12-08 20:51:36] <DoomGuyI_I> geeze... lol
[2022-12-08 20:51:37] <%bongocat_0090> 5  years on steam...
[2022-12-08 20:51:37] <%BotStik> QP just shouldn't effect elo full stop
[2022-12-08 20:51:43] <%$Baconlitheque> @BotStik 100% agreed
[2022-12-08 20:51:45] <%AraniesEugen> it will lower you too @Vombuz but you have to die a loooot more times. i was testing it and 25 deaths to derank from 3 to 2 ...
[2022-12-08 20:51:47] <%$Baconlitheque> it's not representative of a normal match
[2022-12-08 20:51:53] <goldenjohny_> why people dropping mmr?
[2022-12-08 20:51:54] <%Scitmen> vac ban 4 years ago LUL
[2022-12-08 20:51:56] <gore_ne_beda> yeah that's why going solo is bad for the rank imo, might end up losing to lower star players and lose rank more
[2022-12-08 20:52:02] <%$Baconlitheque> it should probably have its own MMR but I'm also okay with it not having MMR

[2022-12-08 20:52:39] <%BotStik> "quickplay" itself even implies no form of rank at all its insane @Baconlitheque
[2022-12-08 20:52:43] <%bongocat_0090> Might as well make a derank button that disables account for 10 days
[2022-12-08 20:52:54] <%AraniesEugen> but thats 25 deaths if its same rank as you
[2022-12-08 20:52:55] <%$Baconlitheque> also I like how he's like "I'm deranking you're not good" like buddy, if you have to derank, neither are you KEKW
[2022-12-08 20:52:56] <%bongocat_0090> they want the feeling of superiority when killing a new player
[2022-12-08 20:53:04] <%+agent_jb008> One can call him, a bozo

[2022-12-08 20:53:29] <%+ZombieGGR> @Baconlitheque Right?
[2022-12-08 20:53:42] <%$Baconlitheque> every time he dies in bounty to a 3 star he's probably like "fucking smurfs and their deranking" when it was a dude with like 8 hours KEKW
[2022-12-08 20:53:44] <%AraniesEugen> but as you said ... i did it only to test teories if you can derank by same rank buuuut what a waste of time :)
[2022-12-08 20:53:54] <%bongocat_0090> i dropped from 5 stars to 3 stars once and i was 5 star again after 2 matches...
[2022-12-08 20:54:00] <DrunkenSnail> Will that trick with streaming highlights negativly effect your future ad incentives?
[2022-12-08 20:54:14] <%$Baconlitheque> I've gone from 5 to 3 to 5 in one session LUL
[2022-12-08 20:54:32] <%Scitmen> I guess it must feel great to derank, kill a newbie, call them bad and repeat the derank process again
[2022-12-08 20:54:32] <gore_ne_beda> i rarely even see people with <100k total rewards on 4 stars

[2022-12-08 20:54:35] <%+agent_jb008> You‚Äôre making me want to play apex vombuz and which is terrible cause I have a bad loot box addiction
[2022-12-08 20:54:54] <DrunkenSnail> I am just worried that they will just increase the hours, or lower the payout
[2022-12-08 20:55:04] <+ImNakedyt> @vombuz the event path , they only apply on solo game or trio aswel? If u play solo vs trio will it be able to have the passive traits ?
[2022-12-08 20:55:25] VIEWERS: 474
[2022-12-08 20:56:26] <%bongocat_0090> MMR is weird, i played on an account for 100 hours and then changed it because the account wasn't really mine and during those 100 hours i was stuck on 3 stars but when i got the new account i was instantly a 5 star and stayed there + even got a 11 kill game but i felt like 3 stars was harder...
[2022-12-08 20:56:29] <gore_ne_beda> well you get these traits in-game as seen in trailer so i guess you can get them solo

[2022-12-08 20:57:31] <%bongocat_0090> in randoms people never play with 6 star sparks snipers not because every 6 star is bad but because most of them are.
[2022-12-08 20:57:42] <@%$Helionos01> bye bombuj
[2022-12-08 20:57:46] <%AraniesEugen> make MMR for normal and for qp :)
