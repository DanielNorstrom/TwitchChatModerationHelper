[2022-12-11 05:27:04] <%crossfirex17> Who's winning the World Cup Zach. Argentina, Croatia, Morocco and France are left.
[2022-12-11 05:27:20] <+xcogmissionx> @501st_captn_nick I can respect that. Unfortunately my only experience with soccer was in 2nd grad
[2022-12-11 05:27:24] <$JesusIRL_> France all the way
[2022-12-11 05:27:25] <YoHoneyC> teams are dumb to look you over IMO bro

[2022-12-11 05:28:05] <501st_captn_nick> @crossfirex17 my hopeful final was Argentina, Brazil, France and Portugal but sadly that‚Äôs not happening so I‚Äôm hoping for Argentina and France with Argentina taking it home for the üêê
[2022-12-11 05:28:05] <YoHoneyC> that‚Äôs fucking insane dude
[2022-12-11 05:28:22] <%opheimer> croatia vs morroco final would be hype for the smaller countries
[2022-12-11 05:28:39] <%opheimer> and teams with best defenses deserve to get there
[2022-12-11 05:28:41] <%crossfirex17> You got some options though Zach? Even if things seem slow.
[2022-12-11 05:28:42] <%+leeplee2> Most good teams aren't even looking for players right
[2022-12-11 05:28:57] <YoHoneyC> that‚Äôs the worst part bro i‚Äôve never understand why peoples/teams ego get over them finding great players
[2022-12-11 05:28:57] <%aDrunkSanta> id imagine most arent looking till after lan
[2022-12-11 05:29:05] <501st_captn_nick> @opheimer yeah but it was be boring for everyone else, also it would be sad because that means neither Messi nor Ronaldo would win a world cup
[2022-12-11 05:29:31] <%+eggs_n_jakey> it's still early wait until after lan and you're likely to have better prospects
[2022-12-11 05:29:33] <%opheimer> they can wipe off their tears with millions of dollars
[2022-12-11 05:30:04] <officialisabell> ive never caught streams before but ive always been a fan of c9, hope things go smoothly for you babyniCOZY you deserve it
[2022-12-11 05:30:04] <%+leeplee2> probably best to wait until roster shuffles after lan?
[2022-12-11 05:30:11] <501st_captn_nick> but it would make a crazy world cup because it would be full of upsets, I mean it already is full of upsets
[2022-12-11 05:30:43] <DaleGribb1e> Do you think their will be roster changes for OPTIC,FAZE and NRG if they don't make LAN?
[2022-12-11 05:31:00] <%+eggs_n_jakey> ya for sure sucks c9 had to do that mid split but you'll be good
[2022-12-11 05:31:08] <denzelyyy> do you think being really good at gaming is based on genetics
[2022-12-11 05:31:08] <%opheimer> france vs morroco might be a bigger game than the final lowkey
[2022-12-11 05:31:28] <%opheimer> not really but you know what i mean
[2022-12-11 05:31:34] <imcalledcrown> @zachmazer Do you offer coaching or think you will in the future?
[2022-12-11 05:31:39] <YoHoneyC> i agree i feel like that teams built for mac just my opinion

[2022-12-11 05:32:12] <501st_captn_nick> it might since morroco has surprised everyone so far. I watched the Portugal game today and that was very sad and I tried watching the France game but fell asleep at around the 27th minute

[2022-12-11 08:44:08] <linkastarta> theres another way, if all the other teams get disbanded
[2022-12-11 08:44:21] <ColoradoYeti95> Hey so do you have plans to keep playing with C9 competitively if you can keep your spot in tournaments? Have you guys spoken about that?
[2022-12-11 08:44:31] <Kylefarmer8> There‚Äôs 10 teams per region that go to Lan in total at the end of it correct? Where‚Äôs the 10th team come from to qual?
[2022-12-11 08:44:45] <itzzwasparsnips> aren't steam configs bannable in ALGS??

[2022-12-11 08:45:22] <Kylefarmer8> @bigchongus_ so regional finals start after the pro league days are over which is 2 more days. The team that wins that regional final will auto qual for lan and then the top 9 also auto qual
[2022-12-11 08:45:24] <zachrb13> Ask anything?? What‚Äôs the future of c9 looking like??
[2022-12-11 08:45:33] <itzzwasparsnips> huge trade
[2022-12-11 08:45:38] <The_Real_Slyte> @zachrb13 there isnt one
[2022-12-11 08:45:48] <%SSCDuvy> @itzzwasparsnips yeah happened recently like a month ago i think to some random team bc a roller player had configs
[2022-12-11 08:45:48] <The_Real_Slyte> @zachrb13 c9 no longer exists
[2022-12-11 08:45:59] <The_Real_Slyte> @zachrb13 atleast not in apex
[2022-12-11 08:46:04] <zachrb13> @the_real_slyte ):
[2022-12-11 08:46:10] <+vraimentzz> fnatic win
[2022-12-11 08:46:12] <%SSCDuvy> was in challenger or something i dont remember too much of it
[2022-12-11 08:46:15] <+bigchongus_> @Kylefarmer8 But what is the incentive if you're say TSM or really any top 5 team to do well? They pretty much autoqual
[2022-12-11 08:46:15] <%Novaslayr> OMEGALUL the car became an airplane
[2022-12-11 08:46:22] <itzzwasparsnips> @sscduvy that's fked but then again google will tell you lmaooo

[2022-12-11 08:47:09] <+vraimentzz> thats FUN123 2 of them played on CR recently tho
[2022-12-11 08:47:21] <Kylefarmer8> @bigchongus_ me personally I say nothing, but I could be wrong. Basically from what I‚Äôm gathering n my understanding, you just wanna be top 9 after regional finals end. Ig there‚Äôs nothing between being 1st or 9th
[2022-12-11 08:47:29] <The_Real_Slyte> zach u could start playing the solo tourneys gdolphn hosts
