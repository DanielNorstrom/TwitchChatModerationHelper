[2022-12-25 14:42:52] <Roguko> Why is there no Scotland flag emoji?  The Unicode Consortium isn't willfully denying Scotland an Emoji based on political allegiances – they most likely don't even have a view on whether Scotland should be independent or not. However, in the eyes of the internet – Scotland is not a country, but a region.
