[2022-12-20 17:47:03] <%slapperofbutts> so basically dont target for masks, just if it happens organically
[2022-12-20 17:47:04] <@%Vader> Im pretty surprised this mandate was put in
[2022-12-20 17:47:05] <%slapperofbutts> ?

[2022-12-20 17:48:31] <+urns> I feel like wrangler just uses it to the verbiage that it has, so he could use it each time, but not technical abuse
[2022-12-20 17:48:32] <@%Vader> Wrangler will drive onto the GSF block and do it
[2022-12-20 17:48:38] <@%Vader> or drive into the cubby

[2022-12-20 17:51:15] <@%Vader> yea
[2022-12-20 17:51:19] <+lightingfiress> How far can the mask mandate be taken… like will cops get into a active chase of non mask compliance???
[2022-12-20 17:51:19] <%Uf0s8mycat> @Klont tattoos are limited
[2022-12-20 17:51:21] <@%Vader> CG has a lot of ped models in the gang
[2022-12-20 17:51:21] <+DisparagingTurtle> Now how does that effect charactoes like Yeager who wear a mask as their "face" ?
[2022-12-20 17:51:22] <+BakinPacman> it does make gang masks more prominent though
[2022-12-20 17:51:22] <Purcht> Those mask might turn into scarfs now
