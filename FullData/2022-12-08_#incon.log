[2022-12-08 15:44:00] <%Nuku_TV> Team deathmatch but you need to farm
[2022-12-08 15:44:00] <+HoratioDub> @DaTeamaSteel It does stacking damage to enemy structures and gives your team a buff to damage, regen, attack speed and cdr
[2022-12-08 15:44:03] <+Revellius> No @ssors
[2022-12-08 15:44:05] <@%MichaelxVoorheees> @ssors no remakes have the card system
[2022-12-08 15:44:07] <%+kanego2113> @Revellius not completely different. only difference is the passive in Pred, and they have different ult abilities
[2022-12-08 15:44:08] <Poobzee> @ssors thankfully no
[2022-12-08 15:44:13] <+vkhaotikv> which sucks cause u see 20k players on steam and only 2000 on predecessor thats a shame
[2022-12-08 15:44:18] <InvadingZimm> @ssors no
[2022-12-08 15:44:18] <ssors> thank god for that
[2022-12-08 15:44:19] <+JoeCal> Which one is more fun pred or this one ?
[2022-12-08 15:44:22] <+HoratioDub> @DaTeamaSteel each time you do Orb Prime, it does more damage to structures
[2022-12-08 15:44:27] <@%^StreamElements> Support the twitchiest community and use code 'Incon' for 20% off your order! https://gfuel.ly/2Uq4LVI
[2022-12-08 15:44:28] <@%MichaelxVoorheees> @vkhaotikv id give it time. this just came out today
[2022-12-08 15:44:39] <+vkhaotikv> @kanego2113 i have a ton of hours in the old paragon have you played it cause this is nothing like it
[2022-12-08 15:44:54] <@%MichaelxVoorheees> !diff
[2022-12-08 15:44:54] <@%^StreamElements> different mechanics for game, some heros have different abilities, pred heros have passives, diff ui and store items, map, buffs, overprime has a sprint. etc etc !compare
[2022-12-08 15:44:55] <@%MichaelxVoorheees> !compare
[2022-12-08 15:44:55] <@%^StreamElements> Incon has described Predecessor as a traditional MOBA while Overprime plays more like an arena shooter with a hint of MOBA gameplay.
[2022-12-08 15:44:56] <+HoratioDub> @vkhaotikv free to play vs paid to play. OP having bigger numbers only makes sense. Their retention is the question
[2022-12-08 15:44:56] <heyJESS3> Is this not in console ??
[2022-12-08 15:44:59] <+vkhaotikv> ITS TEN DOLLARS A CHARACTER AND U NEED 14 FOR RANKED
[2022-12-08 15:45:14] <Jvac29> @heyJESS3 not yet FeelsBadMan
[2022-12-08 15:45:15] <xXCloudAtlasXx0> @vkhaotikv 12 after patch
[2022-12-08 15:45:15] <%+kanego2113> @vkhaotikv Predecessor is more like og paragon on monolith map
[2022-12-08 15:45:19] <@%MichaelxVoorheees> @heyJESS3 its pc during early access. it will be console when it releases and no we dont know when that is
[2022-12-08 15:45:29] <heyJESS3> When is this game coming to console ?
[2022-12-08 15:45:35] <+vkhaotikv> predecessor is basically just like og paragon
[2022-12-08 15:45:37] <%+danceswithcones> Did your entire team follow you to chase the Feng instead of cutting him off?
[2022-12-08 15:45:41] <vash2373> Lol
[2022-12-08 15:45:41] <@%LeikelaRaeRae> @heyJESS3  Neither Overprime or Predecessor are out on console yet, but both games will be on console in the future, there is no set date yet.
[2022-12-08 15:45:46] <x18x2xwildx> They just released a statement saying they are reducing the pricing and you‚Äôll be getting rewards after each match
[2022-12-08 15:45:48] <+HoratioDub> @vkhaotikv they reduced it to 12 but yeah $10 per character is pricey. At least you can earn in game currency after games soon
[2022-12-08 15:46:06] <@%jguy85> is smite down?
[2022-12-08 15:46:06] <+hanshotfirst25> Low-key feel like predecessor will come out on top
[2022-12-08 15:46:12] <+vkhaotikv> @xXCloudAtlasXx0 u can only earn like 6 a week in game lol
[2022-12-08 15:46:12] <+HoratioDub> Unfortunately, I do fear this game is little more than a cash grab based on these prices and practices
[2022-12-08 15:46:13] <icsdue> @incon did you swap to dx11 during the beta? it's 12 by default
[2022-12-08 15:46:13] <@%LeikelaRaeRae> @jguy85  If only.

[2022-12-08 15:46:22] <%+poll0_loc0> I think I would like to change my vote to Pred...looks way more stable and can easily add content
[2022-12-08 15:46:25] <+BT843> i've been reading the privacy policy on this game is insane? thoughts?
[2022-12-08 15:46:26] <+hanshotfirst25> What's smite?
[2022-12-08 15:46:28] <%+IPOISOIN> I wonder if pred will be better optimized for console as well
[2022-12-08 15:46:30] <InvadingZimm> @leikelaraerae HAPPY BIRTHDAY!

[2022-12-08 15:46:39] <@%MichaelxVoorheees> @HoratioDub iv never dealt with this company but a lot of ppl that have kept saying the company is a massive cash grab lol
[2022-12-08 15:46:43] <@%LeikelaRaeRae> @InvadingZimm  inconSquint
[2022-12-08 15:46:49] <heridh> is a game like this winnable?
[2022-12-08 15:46:53] <%Debaucherous> It's a weird combination of features for these games.   Overprime has ranked and more characters which means more variety.. but Pred is FAR more optimized which would make for better ranked but doesn't have ranked
[2022-12-08 15:46:59] <%+Yooman117> It looks like OP removed some of the jankf from the last test
[2022-12-08 15:47:00] <%ZeroRebellion> @BT843 from my understanding, most of that more applies to Korea than anything else as they have some pretty strict laws on gaming
[2022-12-08 15:47:00] <+vkhaotikv> and did anyone read the stuff u clicked at the begging like tik tok they want rights to all ur browser history and cookies fucking china companies
[2022-12-08 15:47:00] <safeworld1> Stop calling Predecessor OG Paragon. I played the original Paragon during Legacy time and Predecessor is nothing like that.
[2022-12-08 15:47:00] <@%MichaelxVoorheees> @heridh i think thats your answer LuL
[2022-12-08 15:47:12] <InMyClaw> Do you guys prefer Predecesor or Paragon: The Overprime?
[2022-12-08 15:47:18] <%+TruePlewd> I also think Pred has more potential for a pro scene. Once the has been time to develope, I think Pred has all the right tools to be the leader, but they are being much more measured in thier releases and development which allowed OP to take the lead on content at the start. I've not heard great things about NetMarble's continued management is live games as well, while Pred dev and marketing teams have riot alumni on them
[2022-12-08 15:47:27] <+vkhaotikv> @safeworld1 are u crazy i have like 400 hours in paragon its way closer than this game
[2022-12-08 15:47:35] <%+lightforceten> it's just fantasy, lass
[2022-12-08 15:47:42] <+Jidiwise> This game was clearly rushed
[2022-12-08 15:47:48] <%+Yooman117> Probably the one think I dont like about Pred is I think the item art is dooky LUL
[2022-12-08 15:47:49] <InvadingZimm> @trueplewd tldr
[2022-12-08 15:47:51] <Jvac29> didn't say gg back to steel FeelsBadMan
[2022-12-08 15:48:00] <icsdue> sorry for repeating it, but @incon did you swap to dx11 in beta? it's not the default option
[2022-12-08 15:48:02] <+hanshotfirst25> This game finna flop in Asia
[2022-12-08 15:48:17] <+vkhaotikv> @Yooman117 i dont care about graphics if the game play is good and in that sense it still dont look that bad
[2022-12-08 15:48:20] <%+krak3nup> i get 70 and I am super happy lol
[2022-12-08 15:48:23] <heridh> @hanshotfirst25 why do you think?
[2022-12-08 15:48:25] <@%MichaelxVoorheees> @Jvac29 toxic streamer inconFeels
[2022-12-08 15:48:27] <@%LeikelaRaeRae> @TruePlewd  Yeah I've heard that apparently majority don't like NetMarble.  *shrug*
[2022-12-08 15:48:28] <safeworld1> @vkhaotikv I didnt say it is more closer. I said none of them are like original Paragon. So stop saying Predecessor is original Paragon. Predecessor copied the Monolith era which was the worst era in all Paragon.
[2022-12-08 15:48:33] <%+TruePlewd> @invadingzimm tldr, Pred will be better in the future and OPs other didn't have a great track record
[2022-12-08 15:48:41] <Jvac29> @MichaelxVoorheees DMIncon Kappa
[2022-12-08 15:48:46] <%+TruePlewd> OP's owner*
[2022-12-08 15:48:47] <+HoratioDub> @MichaelxVoorheees Same, I was ignorant to Netmarble before OP but friends were very wary of their predatory ways and unfortunately after what I saw last night, the hope I had of this not being pay to win dwindled
[2022-12-08 15:48:53] <%+Yooman117> @vkhaotikv Oh I think the game itself looks great! Its just the item art, like the way the items look in Pred
[2022-12-08 15:48:54] <MrJackems> Pred = dead game
[2022-12-08 15:49:01] <+vkhaotikv> @safeworld1 this is true but its damn well the closest we are gonna get so yes im gonna compare
[2022-12-08 15:49:05] <sirsleepysquid> Im trying my best to not be a toxic teammate but i just had a Steel and Sev who didnt buy any items for a full 45 min game

[2022-12-08 15:49:14] <%+poll0_loc0> So it looks like the great divide is already starting between the 2 games
[2022-12-08 15:49:20] <+BrotherAion> @vkhaotikv yeah i dont like that either but they said they would change it
[2022-12-08 15:49:28] <+Jidiwise> @MrJackems Keep dreaming bud
[2022-12-08 15:49:32] <iforgotmyname_420> @safeworld1 the worst era of old paragon was right before it died with the gem system

[2022-12-08 15:49:41] <+hanshotfirst25> @heridh they'd have to have solid servers and also try to compete against LoL and Dota 2 lol

[2022-12-08 15:49:45] <%+Yooman117> @vkhaotikv Oh thank god, its weird having that cartoony art style in it
[2022-12-08 15:49:45] <%Un45aken> Yea definitely got some people playing right now that have no idea whats going on, just try to be nice
[2022-12-08 15:49:51] <%Un45aken> we want to retain these people

[2022-12-08 15:50:35] <%+Ymmit354> The difference between the two is they are different games so i wouldn't say there is a rift if you see them as different games
[2022-12-08 15:50:40] <%+danceswithcones> Lncon teaching self control.. oof, that's tough
[2022-12-08 15:50:42] <mrmeds> its the free to play
[2022-12-08 15:50:44] <+vkhaotikv> its cause people look at art work and the name paragon
[2022-12-08 15:50:45] <safeworld1> The overprime has 30k player vs like 2k...
[2022-12-08 15:50:50] <%+RNGart19> I‚Äôd rather teach someone so they improve then make them quit playing
[2022-12-08 15:50:53] <+Jaeman_63> one is free no kidding
[2022-12-08 15:50:53] <heridh> @hanshotfirst25 this game is different though than those games

[2022-12-08 15:51:00] <%+Yooman117> The F2P option makes it more accessible
[2022-12-08 15:51:03] <heridh> its obvious why though its free
[2022-12-08 15:51:03] <+vkhaotikv> @mrmeds its not free at all lol
[2022-12-08 15:51:04] <Lukanikon> Its the F2P and the asian (mostly korean) community

[2022-12-08 15:51:58] <%Un45aken> I mean... but there are lots more players... so server load unfair comparison
[2022-12-08 15:51:58] <%+TruePlewd> I think Pred will probably stay smaller until the the EA is over just because of the cost. once the full release is out, Pred will probably tick up. a year from now Pred and Overprime will probably be about equal (Pred will probably get better, OP may actually get worse being managed by Net Marble)

[2022-12-08 15:52:12] <@%MichaelxVoorheees> lol
[2022-12-08 15:52:13] <safeworld1> if we talk about player retention. At least OP has ranked. Predecessor has nothing. So they will both lose players but OP will have bigger retention for sure.
[2022-12-08 15:52:17] <+bigdoinksinhand> you should check out DKO it just released last week
[2022-12-08 15:52:24] <%+LMW_YBC> People buy heroes in League? KEKHeim

[2022-12-08 15:53:03] <Lukanikon> For me OP is the better game atm, but Pred is the better Moba. I'm excited to see where both are christmas next year :)
[2022-12-08 15:53:15] <%+Yooman117> I think they're on rotation you only own tb
[2022-12-08 15:53:21] <+vkhaotikv> @Jidiwise to many people just assume before getting knowledge
[2022-12-08 15:53:27] <%philofyore> green arrows are just free rotation right?
[2022-12-08 15:53:32] <@%MichaelxVoorheees> i thought it was vote 1 person to do both bans

[2022-12-08 15:54:01] <%tyrellthewise> i think overprime is a much more challenging game to be honest
[2022-12-08 15:54:05] <+HoratioDub> @TruePlewd Omeda deliberately want a smaller player base right now as they iron out issues. They want the game to be more robust for it's free to play launch so they have a better chance of retaining players. It's  noble but a massive risk nonetheless. That said, Netmarble are listening and responding so I'm just watching to see how they make further improvements
[2022-12-08 15:54:24] <+Jidiwise> @vkhaotikv You can just tell how rushed this game is in order for Netmarble to start making $$$ where Pred is really taking their time to do it right.
[2022-12-08 15:54:28] <heridh> I wish this game let me change the line that comes out of its head it annoys me so much

[2022-12-08 15:54:59] <@%MichaelxVoorheees> i really like phase's backpack
[2022-12-08 15:55:06] <@%MichaelxVoorheees> i want
[2022-12-08 15:55:09] <+vkhaotikv> @tyrellthewise i dont think its more difficulty cuase i have had some tuff ass games in pred this game someone gets ahead and just crushes everyone its gets very one sided very fast
[2022-12-08 15:55:15] <@%jguy85> @Incon im some random guy on the internet and since you are playing a new game my first message is to tell you, that you should play your old game.
[2022-12-08 15:55:15] <heridh> are they playing on west servers?
[2022-12-08 15:55:19] <+hanshotfirst25> Bee bop capitalism
[2022-12-08 15:55:29] <safeworld1> Omeda choice to make the EA payed was terrible considering they even offer more contents than their F2P competitor. In fact the numbers are proving that
[2022-12-08 15:55:35] <TstMomo> im just really confused why overprime calls this release early access lol. i feel like this is treated as a full release
[2022-12-08 15:55:36] <%+Yooman117> Ah if it still has that teleporty jank I can wait for OP lol
[2022-12-08 15:55:36] <+Jidiwise> @MrJackems Haha, I could say the same about you.
[2022-12-08 15:55:51] <safeworld1> less content than OP i mean
[2022-12-08 15:55:58] <+vkhaotikv> is there even a blink in this game?
[2022-12-08 15:56:01] <%Un45aken> They nerfed phase... but she still busted
[2022-12-08 15:56:02] <@%jguy85> im not playing either game so it don't matter if they are good or not
[2022-12-08 15:56:04] <%+Andy1134> phased him back to base
[2022-12-08 15:56:06] <+AnActualDoggo> !compare
[2022-12-08 15:56:06] <@%^StreamElements> Incon has described Predecessor as a traditional MOBA while Overprime plays more like an arena shooter with a hint of MOBA gameplay.
[2022-12-08 15:56:06] <+wilkinator93> phase mid instead of support hurts my eyes
[2022-12-08 15:56:07] <+vkhaotikv> i didnt see one from the games i played this morning
[2022-12-08 15:56:17] <%LiLbluduck1> this girl like sol?
[2022-12-08 15:56:19] <%tyrellthewise> @vkhaotikv true the snowball in OP is real. I think thats why its a challenging game also its fun when you part of the snowball
[2022-12-08 15:56:25] <@%MichaelxVoorheees> @vkhaotikv your starter. depending which you chose. this mana one is a blink i think
[2022-12-08 15:56:26] <heridh> @safeworld1 they probably made more money though which leads to better funding to the game
[2022-12-08 15:56:27] <+HoratioDub> @MichaelxVoorheees in OG paragon, it was alive! It's name is Slugo
[2022-12-08 15:56:32] <%+Yooman117> @vkhaotikv yes
[2022-12-08 15:56:34] <heridh> they arent funded by epic afterall
[2022-12-08 15:56:39] <+hanshotfirst25> Will one of these games make me stop playing genshin impact? Now that's the real question
[2022-12-08 15:56:39] <@%MichaelxVoorheees> @MichaelxVoorheees inconAww
[2022-12-08 15:56:39] <TstMomo> i think the difference is that overprime is basically a full release and pred is a game still under development.
[2022-12-08 15:56:41] <%+Andy1134> accept my link howie
[2022-12-08 15:56:45] <+BrotherAion> is phase a regular caster now?
[2022-12-08 15:56:50] <%ZeroRebellion> and the blind time, too
[2022-12-08 15:56:50] <%+TruePlewd> @vkhaotikv the blink is on the starter for solo, mid, and adc
[2022-12-08 15:56:50] <+wilkinator93> @hanshotfirst25 pred will
[2022-12-08 15:57:04] <+wilkinator93> @BrotherAion unfortunate yes
[2022-12-08 15:57:13] <+BrotherAion> interesting
[2022-12-08 15:57:14] <heridh> I heard this game is funded by epic is that false?
[2022-12-08 15:57:17] <+CJTh3Immortal> what are your opinions on pred vs paragon
[2022-12-08 15:57:22] <@%MichaelxVoorheees> !pref
[2022-12-08 15:57:23] <@%^StreamElements> Incon has no preference to Pred vs Overprime
[2022-12-08 15:57:24] <+HoratioDub> @TruePlewd Same. They responded to the criticism yesterday well but it's a bad sign that they thought it'd be acceptable to drop those prices in the first place. I don't have much faith in them

[2022-12-08 15:57:32] <@%jguy85> my smooth brain take of the day:  both games will die because of last hitting
[2022-12-08 15:57:36] <+wilkinator93> @heridh the other one
[2022-12-08 15:57:39] <+hanshotfirst25> @wilkinator93 I can buy the epic bundle or whatever it's called for about $5 give or take
[2022-12-08 15:57:40] <x18x2xwildx> My OCD gets triggered by how chaotic the minion placement gets in these two games lol
[2022-12-08 15:57:45] <+BrotherAion> @heridh this and predecessor both are it seems.
[2022-12-08 15:57:48] <%+Yooman117> @heridh Not funded just allowed them to use the paragon name
[2022-12-08 15:58:00] <heridh> interesting

[2022-12-08 15:58:09] <safeworld1> this one is more fun
[2022-12-08 15:58:11] <heridh> but why only this had access to the game
[2022-12-08 15:58:12] <Thork_TV> not even close
[2022-12-08 15:58:17] <+vkhaotikv> @tyrellthewise ya i agree but the snowball can be fun but id rather have good games then just game after game switch snowballs or who wins
[2022-12-08 15:58:20] <heridh> to the name
[2022-12-08 15:58:20] <%+Andy1134> as long as its not 0
[2022-12-08 15:58:30] <@%MichaelxVoorheees> @heridh cuz they chose to buy it probably lol
[2022-12-08 15:58:42] <+wilkinator93> @hanshotfirst25 predecessor always. best moba out there
[2022-12-08 15:58:45] <@%MichaelxVoorheees> overprime bought the name
[2022-12-08 15:58:49] <heridh> @MichaelxVoorheees oh so they bought the ip
[2022-12-08 15:58:50] <@%MichaelxVoorheees> yea
[2022-12-08 15:58:57] <@%jguy85> last hitting is making lassiz toxic...

[2022-12-08 15:59:10] <+wilkinator93> but pred feels more like the og paragon
[2022-12-08 15:59:11] <+Tomahawk1x> #GraphicsSlut
[2022-12-08 15:59:14] <+HoratioDub> @safeworld1 yeah Omeda are taking a massive risk here. Pay to play EA is common but in this situation where a company with more money can manage a free to play product with the same assets AND pump out more content, it's a hard sell
[2022-12-08 15:59:15] <PrognosticTV> did you have youe cbt emblems and everything or did you lose them too?
[2022-12-08 15:59:27] <TstMomo> predecessor did get a grant form epic though @heridh
[2022-12-08 15:59:42] <InvadingZimm> @incon can she crit with that ability?
[2022-12-08 15:59:44] <+HoratioDub> I'm a gameplay first person, and I prefer Pred but it's a skeleton in its current state
[2022-12-08 15:59:46] <@%MichaelxVoorheees> pros and incons
[2022-12-08 15:59:48] <heridh> I thought any game can use these assets though
[2022-12-08 15:59:51] <%+Andy1134> pros and Incons
[2022-12-08 15:59:51] <%Debaucherous> Together they would make for a hell of a game
[2022-12-08 15:59:54] <%+IPOISOIN> Pros and Lcons
[2022-12-08 15:59:55] <%+TruePlewd> I enjoy both. I am wary of OP's management going forward, and think Pred will be better managed and improve faster looking at where thier dev team has been before coming to Pred
[2022-12-08 15:59:55] <%+bigo26shen> @incon I didn‚Äôt like overprime and don‚Äôt really wanna pay for a beta I guess I could try to get good at overprime

[2022-12-08 16:00:06] <@%LeikelaRaeRae> @heridh  They can.  Name doesn't count as an asset like that.
[2022-12-08 16:00:09] <safeworld1> @hanshotfirst25 if it was the best moba why Pred keeps losing players every day since one week??
[2022-12-08 16:00:20] <TstMomo> i enjoy both but im very sceptical of netmarble haha
[2022-12-08 16:00:28] <heridh> @LeikelaRaeRae yeah that makes sense

[2022-12-08 16:01:18] <+wilkinator93> @safeworld1 weird situation here with OP f2p. and the paragon veterans paid money. but the rest of the world didnt..
[2022-12-08 16:01:28] <heridh> I even would pay for pred but there is no servers for where I leave so I have no choice

[2022-12-08 16:01:56] <Sinraaw> The TOS of OP seem really sketchy
[2022-12-08 16:01:56] <%muggs237> @TruePlewd i think you are right, pred has made sure to have solid team in place that were passionate about og paragon in some way shape or form and have established a solid foundation
[2022-12-08 16:02:16] <starwindm> @Incon Overprime or Pred, which do you prefer?

[2022-12-08 16:03:38] <@%LeikelaRaeRae> @jguy85  The only bonus I've noticed for last hitting in this game, you can tell by the creep HP bar when to hit to get that last hit.
[2022-12-08 16:03:43] <heridh> its from korea so I heard in there they need real documents to play
[2022-12-08 16:03:43] <Sinraaw> Ah ok yeah that's the difference I never played a mobile game :)
[2022-12-08 16:03:46] <TstMomo> TOS for a lot of games are sketchy lol especially mobile games
[2022-12-08 16:04:07] <@%jguy85> @LeikelaRaeRae that just shows you how bad it is
[2022-12-08 16:04:24] <@%LeikelaRaeRae> @jguy85  Or shows you how they're trying to help people successfully last hit.   LUL
[2022-12-08 16:04:38] <@%MichaelxVoorheees> @TruePlewd during the OP beta i woulda said i like op. but after seeing pred and looking at op again both in game and choices.. im heavy leaning towards pred lol
[2022-12-08 16:04:38] <safeworld1> the thing i really dislike of Predecessor is how claustrophobic is their Map. The river distance is like 3mt. Doing team fights 5 vs 5 there feels terrible. Here its not big as Legacy but still 10 times better for group fights
[2022-12-08 16:05:17] <%+Andy1134> let me pull up my item notes
[2022-12-08 16:05:17] <starwindm> @safeworld1 Preds map is basically Monolith, yeah?
[2022-12-08 16:05:18] <heridh> you know what would be cool for this game if when you sprint you used a mount
[2022-12-08 16:05:21] <%Debaucherous> They need to give the Smite equivalent for you to know
[2022-12-08 16:05:35] <%+Andy1134> 1 ward unless you have the support item
[2022-12-08 16:05:45] <%Nuku_TV> 1 ward, but the ward got a fat range
[2022-12-08 16:05:50] <Lukanikon> Yeah, one ward but you COULD buy more fpr 50g each I think
[2022-12-08 16:05:53] <%+bigo26shen> @incon maybe do like a patch review while looking in game so you have some reference for YouTube
[2022-12-08 16:05:55] <%tyrellthewise> omg that ability does damage
[2022-12-08 16:05:58] <safeworld1> @starwindm yeah its basically the claustrophobic Monolith
[2022-12-08 16:05:59] <@%jguy85> @LeikelaRaeRae when she told her bf that we were engaged i walked up behind her and said she's my ex-gf and started chuckling

[2022-12-08 16:08:30] <heridh> its not a hero shooter
[2022-12-08 16:08:32] <safeworld1> @vkhaotikv but its slow and boring. Also their map is very small so basically you have many team fights in closer areas. I prefer the open space of the original Legacy for sure

[2022-12-08 16:09:23] <%+LordBifrost> when you realize every hero cost 10 bucks NotLikeThis
[2022-12-08 16:09:23] <TioMeko> @Wook1n disaggree with what? Just tuned in
[2022-12-08 16:09:25] <GrandpaKeif> I just keep hearing how you have buy heroes in OP just to play ranked. You only start with 5. Or grind for like 7 weeks to unlock all of them.
[2022-12-08 16:09:30] <%Big_Headed_Gamer> @MichaelxVoorheees i don't see that in my DM's of discord
[2022-12-08 16:09:32] <+vkhaotikv> @safeworld1 i agree but i have a hard time liking this just comes off has a hero shooter and very cringe i want some strategy honestly the game was kind of easy
[2022-12-08 16:09:32] <%+lightforceten> 1 hour until lor worlds starts
[2022-12-08 16:09:37] <%+Andy1134> Incon is an ambush predator you think hes weak then he just pulls out an uno reverse card.
[2022-12-08 16:09:42] <Wook1n> that this is less of a moba and worse in any way
[2022-12-08 16:09:46] <@%LeikelaRaeRae> @jguy85  Yaaaaaaaaaas.  That's so awesome!  I'm around 10 more payments to finish paying off my debt and I can be back in school by next year!
[2022-12-08 16:09:49] <heridh> you could make an arguement that is more like a moba with hero shooter elements not the other way
[2022-12-08 16:09:55] <%+verictalosson> rev feels so good in mid
[2022-12-08 16:10:08] <@%jguy85> @LeikelaRaeRae you will do so well
[2022-12-08 16:10:16] <%+Andy1134> it could be worse It could be sev range
[2022-12-08 16:10:21] <aWoLunare> Phase should just be reverted with her abilites back to support
[2022-12-08 16:10:33] <@%LeikelaRaeRae> @jguy85  It's gonna be nice being back in school.  I can't wait to finish that degree.
[2022-12-08 16:10:34] <GrandpaKeif> Is there any break in fighting? Jesus
[2022-12-08 16:10:35] <heridh> @vkhaotikv Im the opposite of you as someone that doesnt like mobas as much this game appeals to me a lot
[2022-12-08 16:10:43] <+HoratioDub> @safeworld1 fully agree on the map being claustrophobic in some areas. Pred needs more open spaces like this. That said, Pred does beat this for verticality imo
[2022-12-08 16:10:48] <%+kanego2113> that man chose death
[2022-12-08 16:10:56] <%Nuku_TV> After the first 5 minutes, it just turns into an arena game
[2022-12-08 16:11:00] <@%MichaelxVoorheees> @Big_Headed_Gamer at the top there is a show user profile... idk how the turned on for me
[2022-12-08 16:11:14] <heridh> @HoratioDub does this game have that hero that double jumps on here?
[2022-12-08 16:11:25] <@%MichaelxVoorheees> yes
[2022-12-08 16:11:26] <%+poll0_loc0> !nec
[2022-12-08 16:11:26] <@%^StreamElements> Incon's in a tight spot!  Oh no!  He's going to die, isn't he..... Isn't he?  Wasn't even close 509 times!
[2022-12-08 16:11:26] <+vkhaotikv> @heridh and thats fine but someone who played paragon og and league this was not what i was excpecting at all
[2022-12-08 16:11:28] <safeworld1> @HoratioDub True in face original Lecacy also has verticality which OP hasnt implemented for now
[2022-12-08 16:11:36] <safeworld1> in fact
[2022-12-08 16:11:42] <heridh> @vkhaotikv fair
[2022-12-08 16:11:44] <TstMomo> i think that the fact people are currently arguing over how different the games are shows they can both do well i think
[2022-12-08 16:11:47] <+vkhaotikv> @heridh like he just said its not a mobe so it pisses me off they call it paragon lol
[2022-12-08 16:11:51] <+hanshotfirst25> She just did a kamehameha
[2022-12-08 16:11:54] <+HoratioDub> @heridh Kallari, yes. But she can't double jump in this
[2022-12-08 16:11:56] <afhicarus> how is the ingame feedback feel brotha?

[2022-12-08 16:12:14] <%+lightforceten> is smite really a moba? or is it technically spaghetti?
[2022-12-08 16:12:17] <heridh> @HoratioDub oh thats sad
[2022-12-08 16:12:31] <GrandpaKeif> @vkhaotikv Not a good idea to use the name of a game that DIED lol
[2022-12-08 16:12:31] <+hanshotfirst25> Smite is just a skin
[2022-12-08 16:12:36] <%Big_Headed_Gamer> @MichaelxVoorheees ah i see it. (unavailable) for my current DMs danHmm
[2022-12-08 16:12:40] <Mantequi1la> wut is the announcer even announcing?
[2022-12-08 16:12:45] <+BrotherAion> worst ever? omg
[2022-12-08 16:12:47] <@%MichaelxVoorheees> @MichaelxVoorheees are you nitro? maybe its that
[2022-12-08 16:12:54] <+vkhaotikv> @GrandpaKeif so obviously u have no knowledge of why paragon went away do you lo9l
[2022-12-08 16:12:57] <heridh> why that from looking predecessor feels more responsive
[2022-12-08 16:13:01] <%+lightforceten> @Incon how have the developers for OP and pred been in terms of streamer support?
[2022-12-08 16:13:08] <Mantequi1la> Oh lol. Man's driving me nuts.
[2022-12-08 16:13:09] <+HoratioDub> @HoratioDub Legacy map really was a work of art. Huge, verticality, wide open spaces AND narrow corridors at different points, shadow pools - the works.
[2022-12-08 16:13:11] <+hanshotfirst25> Very offbrand version of the halo announcer
[2022-12-08 16:13:12] <Wook1n> the game never died.. the company chose to put it down to make money on fortnite
[2022-12-08 16:13:16] <DFBonito> so what youre saying is we should play predecessor and not this game
[2022-12-08 16:13:20] <%Debaucherous> 3HP and a dream
[2022-12-08 16:13:21] <@%MichaelxVoorheees> that would be a game dying
[2022-12-08 16:13:22] <%Big_Headed_Gamer> @MichaelxVoorheees I'm subbed to max tier on discord

[2022-12-08 16:13:28] <@%MichaelxVoorheees> the servers literally shut down lol
[2022-12-08 16:13:33] <GrandpaKeif> @vkhaotikv I‚Äôm just saying it‚Äôs funny to use the name of a game that died and failed essentially.
[2022-12-08 16:13:34] <%+Andy1134> might as well be at full Incon
[2022-12-08 16:13:34] <Lukanikon> If more then 2 things happen in very quick succession, the announcer gets confused LUL
[2022-12-08 16:13:37] <Mantequi1la> He on X-Game mode
[2022-12-08 16:13:40] <+vkhaotikv> @GrandpaKeif do you even kno who made paragon do u have any idea what your talking about the only reason paragon went away is cause they put all the resources on fortnite which
[2022-12-08 16:13:45] <+HoratioDub> I realllly wish this game had character passives
[2022-12-08 16:13:46] <heridh> it was because of fortnite
[2022-12-08 16:13:50] <%muggs237> the other thing to consider between the two is that pred is gonna hit console first, which will be big for player base and popularity
[2022-12-08 16:13:53] <heridh> fortnite the game killer Kappa
[2022-12-08 16:13:55] <+hanshotfirst25> X game mode and Adderall
[2022-12-08 16:14:04] <+vkhaotikv> @GrandpaKeif still had a player base it wasnt a failed game lmao read up get knowledge
[2022-12-08 16:14:05] <%+Andy1134> them bugs are from Australia
[2022-12-08 16:14:20] <%dershbag> @GrandpaKeif Paragon didn't die or fail. Epic killed the game in favor of Fortnite.
[2022-12-08 16:14:21] <+hanshotfirst25> Nah from Ohio
[2022-12-08 16:14:28] <+HoratioDub> Passives would add so much complexity to characters in this
[2022-12-08 16:14:32] <heridh> it runs on 60 fps
[2022-12-08 16:14:35] <%Therion28> @Incon She is no Scylla versus a Red buff
[2022-12-08 16:14:42] <+hanshotfirst25> Dying is being killed üíÄ
[2022-12-08 16:14:43] <%Debaucherous> consoles do 60fps normally now
[2022-12-08 16:14:43] <TstMomo> pred is pretty far in console development they've said so yeh
[2022-12-08 16:14:47] <%+lightforceten> modern consoles should be able to do 60
[2022-12-08 16:14:47] <heridh> all on low it runs on 60 I think
[2022-12-08 16:14:57] <TstMomo> when the actual console release is tho, who knows
[2022-12-08 16:15:00] <safeworld1> @HoratioDub True Legacy was really amazing. They changed it with Monolith because they said games were too long... Now you still have 40+ mins lenght games and a map Monolith that i cant stand. Then Fortnite did the rest
[2022-12-08 16:15:01] <%muggs237> @Incon i dont think OP can at all, and they have no update on official controller support which is a good indicator that they wont go to console
[2022-12-08 16:15:01] <+BrotherAion> @GrandpaKeif yeah but its good for marketing. people who lost paragon on console would love to hop on paragon again so to them the thought is just "it's back"
[2022-12-08 16:15:02] <Jvac29> nah i think it would run on current gen console pretty well
[2022-12-08 16:15:02] <+vkhaotikv> @GrandpaKeif fornite came out a year after paragon so it was a business decision so dont just assume ur know ur stuff when u pry werent even old enough lol
[2022-12-08 16:15:03] <+hanshotfirst25> 10 fps on switch
[2022-12-08 16:15:10] <Mantequi1la> I know the ping system in Pred is inspired from og Paragon. they used that ping system because of controllers.
[2022-12-08 16:15:10] <@%jguy85> xSx should be fine at 60
[2022-12-08 16:15:13] <DFBonito> lmao, if it runs on your pc for 75 i better not even install it
[2022-12-08 16:15:18] <+HoratioDub> Pred actually has controller support without the use of Steam or Epic. OP isn't that far yet
[2022-12-08 16:15:19] <%muggs237> not having that added player base can easily kill the game
[2022-12-08 16:15:31] <Wook1n> people dont like being lvl 13 at 25 minutes in pred i know that
[2022-12-08 16:15:31] <heridh> @safeworld1 was paragon graphics better than this games or worse I never saw the game at its prime
[2022-12-08 16:15:33] <%+poll0_loc0> Split push support OP
[2022-12-08 16:15:34] <Jvac29> my pc is too old, i need it to run on console FeelsBadMan
[2022-12-08 16:15:44] <drake8itch> this game better than predecessor?
[2022-12-08 16:15:51] <%Therion28> @DFBonito Same I play on a laptop lol
[2022-12-08 16:15:56] <NikitisDoesEverything> !pref
[2022-12-08 16:15:56] <@%^StreamElements> Incon has no preference to Pred vs Overprime
[2022-12-08 16:16:00] <Mantequi1la> Saw nibori seamlessly switch between key/mouse to controller without issue and mid combat. So im sure they will win the console crowd.
[2022-12-08 16:16:03] <heridh> @safeworld1 I am assuming it was worse
[2022-12-08 16:16:07] <+BrotherAion> @vkhaotikv lol why are you so mad yo. relax
[2022-12-08 16:16:14] <j0hnnyNukem> The monolith map is just so much better then the legacy map imo, legacy map hits the nostaliga i guess, but thats it
[2022-12-08 16:16:15] <+HoratioDub> @HoratioDub maaaan Monolith should've been so much more. We didn't get the true monolith, just some tiny bastard child that was congested
[2022-12-08 16:16:24] <%+bigo26shen> @incon that man came from pred
[2022-12-08 16:16:26] <+hanshotfirst25> I have a rtx 2060 on my laptop and it's great lop
[2022-12-08 16:16:32] <+vkhaotikv> @BrotherAion not mad just facts and im upset this wasnt what it should of been when i was looking so forward to it so sucks lol
[2022-12-08 16:16:33] <prince_tage> what are the classes in this game ?
[2022-12-08 16:16:36] <DoctorPendulum> is this ranked?
[2022-12-08 16:16:45] <DFBonito> i got a desktop but its like 5 yo and has a i5 7th gen and a 1060ti 6gb, i need me a i9 and a rtx 4090
[2022-12-08 16:16:46] <Wook1n> as long as they dont bring back the cards i dont care about the map
[2022-12-08 16:16:47] <safeworld1> @heridh The art was 10 times better. If the talk about graphic the assets were pretty much the same
[2022-12-08 16:16:49] <GrandpaKeif> @vkhaotikv Bro you need to chill. Yes it died cause it alienated its player base. I got a founders pack. Say what you want. If it makes you feel better I‚Äôll say epic games failed. But either way it‚Äôs a dead game. Sure it was killed. But you look to be just looking for someone to channel your feelings
[2022-12-08 16:16:53] <@%MichaelxVoorheees> @DoctorPendulum no
[2022-12-08 16:16:55] <@%LeikelaRaeRae> @MichaelxVoorheees  You know what I find interesting?
[2022-12-08 16:16:55] <%muggs237> preds controller support is seamless, and the fact that it has in game setting for duel sense controller is amazing
[2022-12-08 16:16:58] <PlanetRez> looks like the original legacy map in paragon?
[2022-12-08 16:17:01] <Jvac29> is that ishtar monkaS
[2022-12-08 16:17:03] <+Blushell> @Mantequi1la I do the same. I use controller to play but use mouse and keyboard for pings and the item shop XD
[2022-12-08 16:17:04] <@%MichaelxVoorheees> @LeikelaRaeRae enlighten me inconSip
[2022-12-08 16:17:15] <prince_tage> so warrior , gaurdian, hunter , mage and assassins?
[2022-12-08 16:17:23] <heridh> @safeworld1 interesting I might look at some videos later the art here does look generic
[2022-12-08 16:17:28] <+hanshotfirst25> They have duel sense support? @muggs237
[2022-12-08 16:17:30] <heridh> @safeworld1 you mean it was more stylized?
[2022-12-08 16:17:31] <NikitisDoesEverything> @Jvac29 basically lol
[2022-12-08 16:17:33] <+BrotherAion> @vkhaotikv i feel that. its def disappointing. neither of these games are what i was hoping they would be. but they're better than nothing and we can just try to enjoy what's there, y'know?
[2022-12-08 16:17:33] <+vkhaotikv> @GrandpaKeif why u bringing feelings into this werent we talking about game dont be so emotional
[2022-12-08 16:17:34] <+itsmeChris10> @prince_tage yup

[2022-12-08 16:17:50] <+HoratioDub> @prince_tage basically. hunters are called rangers, mages are called casters but yeah it's 1-1 with what you're used to in Smite

[2022-12-08 16:18:19] <safeworld1> @heridh the map was bigger. There was verticality, the jungle was completely different. It was amazing

[2022-12-08 16:18:21] <+vkhaotikv> @BrotherAion all the people i use to play with are now on pred we been having fun but it deff helps that we have a 5 man sqaud think it would be alot harder soloing
[2022-12-08 16:18:30] <Mantequi1la> @Mantequi1la Pred controller support Is impressive i haven't played many games that can switch so easily between the 2 inputs.
[2022-12-08 16:18:32] <@%MichaelxVoorheees> @LeikelaRaeRae LuL yea.. its like ppl want a carbon copy, and fail to realize its a different company using assets to make their idea of the game
[2022-12-08 16:18:40] <PlanetRez> does over prime have a studio behind it or is it still fan made 1 man team?

[2022-12-08 16:19:36] <safeworld1> @heridh yeah also the arena of the Orb prime was giant and there were incredible team fights. I am sure people remember them
[2022-12-08 16:19:37] <+BrotherAion> @Mantequi1la yeah i actively use both as i'm playing since i more of a console user. after seeing the ping system in this game, i really wonder how its gonna work on controller
[2022-12-08 16:19:39] <@%MichaelxVoorheees> @prince_tage not really but some heros do both dmg types

[2022-12-08 16:20:07] <PlanetRez> @heridh yeah I know that. I just haven't kept up with the projects at all and remember over prime started as a one man project.
[2022-12-08 16:20:08] <Mantequi1la> @Wook1n That is not correct. NetMatble a Korean developer is behind OverPrime.
[2022-12-08 16:20:08] <prince_tage> @michaelxvoorheees basically what I mean , that cool üòé
[2022-12-08 16:20:17] <+vkhaotikv> im gonna try this again later with an actual sqaud and see if the outcome is a little better
[2022-12-08 16:20:21] <heridh> @safeworld1 was the game slower ? or this fast
[2022-12-08 16:20:23] <%+poll0_loc0> Phase is great to dive into the backline and combo a squishy
[2022-12-08 16:20:32] <+vkhaotikv> but i have a feeling most will yell at me and want to go back to pred lol
[2022-12-08 16:20:37] <heridh> @PlanetRez no way thats cool
[2022-12-08 16:20:38] <safeworld1> @heridh OP is much faster
[2022-12-08 16:20:40] <masterbeatertv> Ya thanks, hopefully they add it with the update tomorrow (contorller)
[2022-12-08 16:20:46] <Poobzee> @Wook1n epic let them have the name. thats it
[2022-12-08 16:21:11] <Mantequi1la> If anything Pred had EPIC's backing since Pred can be downloaded from their EPIC games launcher.
[2022-12-08 16:21:12] <%johnkeiwo> hey incon, how is health today ?
[2022-12-08 16:21:13] <%Un45aken> except she cant jungle
[2022-12-08 16:21:16] <%+SalaComMander> Is going from Predecessor to this confusing?
[2022-12-08 16:21:16] <+BrotherAion> @vkhaotikv lol good luck. i might end up trying this out later. it does look fun but a bit too fast for my tastes.
[2022-12-08 16:21:29] <@%LeikelaRaeRae> @MichaelxVoorheees  I installed Skywalker Saga since it's on game pass, and I didn't realize how open it was.   o.o
[2022-12-08 16:21:33] <+vkhaotikv> @BrotherAion you on pc?
[2022-12-08 16:21:35] <%Un45aken> I think she is honestly the best solo laner IMO
[2022-12-08 16:21:40] <%+bigo26shen> @incon could she solo?
[2022-12-08 16:21:42] <%+SalaComMander> She's got HUGE...dive the backline energy KappaHD
[2022-12-08 16:21:47] <%+TruePlewd> so, you're saying phase jungle
[2022-12-08 16:21:53] <prince_tage> @michaelxvoorheees any idea in the size of this game? and where to get ryleerComfy

[2022-12-08 16:22:24] <%+Andy1134> fun fact the shadow realm is different from the shadow zone

[2022-12-08 16:22:30] <j0hnnyNukem> @poobzee They boughy the rights to the name and logo didn't they? Or do you have source that they acually gave them the rights?

[2022-12-08 16:22:55] <@%MichaelxVoorheees> @prince_tage steam. and the size says 15 gb storage i think. predecessor also was about 10 gb they arent big downloads lol
[2022-12-08 16:22:55] <heridh> @safeworld1 I just watched some paragon gameplay it does feel more polished than this ngl
[2022-12-08 16:23:03] <@%LeikelaRaeRae> @MichaelxVoorheees  Also, I just wanna ask if HiRez has really lost their mind.  I saw in the patch notes that they've decided to have fully party queues for ranked from the 13th to 20th?
[2022-12-08 16:23:11] <%+darkoraven> @leikelaraerae new star wars game announcement is coming soon, I think!
[2022-12-08 16:23:12] <%johnkeiwo> RAW natural talent !

[2022-12-08 16:23:20] <@%MichaelxVoorheees> @LeikelaRaeRae and its like 3x a day lol
[2022-12-08 16:23:22] <TossTheBossOut> damn you just pooped on them
[2022-12-08 16:23:28] <@%LeikelaRaeRae> @MichaelxVoorheees  Yeah but still....
[2022-12-08 16:23:30] <cybercena89> now he dies to minions Kappa
[2022-12-08 16:23:31] <Mantequi1la> Phase was a support in og paragon. Her tether was a friendlys link that gave healing on ability cast and her pull was for friendlys only.  She was an amazing anti-gank support. Sad they removed all of that from her kit and made her just some ability assassin.
[2022-12-08 16:23:33] <@%LeikelaRaeRae> @darkoraven  Sweet!
[2022-12-08 16:23:43] <heridh> @safeworld1 I love how it doesnt have that stupid line to the crosshair too and it looks more like pred than this game
[2022-12-08 16:23:48] <+vkhaotikv> hey they could take alot of community advice and make this game good and i deff hope thats the outcome and they can make it be close to the moba paragon use to be just got to wait and see i guesss
[2022-12-08 16:23:50] <%johnkeiwo> damn this man is kinda good, maybe he should go pro Kappa
[2022-12-08 16:23:56] <+BrotherAion> @vkhaotikv yeah i got ps5, series x, just enjoy console gaming more. but i've been enjoying pred bc at least i can play on controller which i'm much better at
[2022-12-08 16:23:59] <@%MichaelxVoorheees> @LeikelaRaeRae inconDerpy yea idk lol it makes no sense cuz...thats teh whole reason they limited to 2 party queus
[2022-12-08 16:24:00] <%+bigo26shen> @incon if I had more time I think I could get at these 2 mobas
[2022-12-08 16:24:03] <%that_one_ginger_boy> @leikelaraerae shhh we here at hirez make meaningful and wanted changes to ranked Kappa
[2022-12-08 16:24:03] <%+Andy1134> almost like you were a professional

[2022-12-08 16:25:00] <+vkhaotikv> @Mantequi1la true but the can balance and put a bigger map on i notice it has like a map selection the missing of one tower was a little odd to me
[2022-12-08 16:25:14] <NikitisDoesEverything> holy 20/3 batman

[2022-12-08 16:26:06] <Mantequi1la> Lol im just trolling. People fault Pred for being in early access but turn around and say overprime need more time even though this is its full release.
[2022-12-08 16:26:06] <+Jidiwise> @Incon Do you notice a difference with the respawn timer increase after 15 minutes?
[2022-12-08 16:26:14] <%muggs237> @Incon that one range minion was putting in work on you for a second there when you were boxing sparrow lol
[2022-12-08 16:26:25] <sycree3> Broken? XD
[2022-12-08 16:26:43] <j0hnnyNukem> 56-33 lmao, killing someone in this must be like killing another minion LUL

[2022-12-08 16:26:56] <+Blushell> 90 kills BTW
[2022-12-08 16:27:09] <%+SalaComMander> So, Incon, is going from Predecessor to this game confusing at all?
[2022-12-08 16:27:16] <%dershbag> I think we can all agree that both games are fun but both still have a lot to work on while they're in Early Access
[2022-12-08 16:27:18] <%Un45aken> Yea I wish they added some end game pots
[2022-12-08 16:27:20] <%+BunsOfBread> Howdy

[2022-12-08 16:29:09] <+Jidiwise> lol, and everyone is going insane for the $10 entry fee for Pred

[2022-12-08 16:45:40] <!%bobisha94> @Incon I think that's because you need multiples of the same item to combine into different items

[2022-12-08 16:52:29] <+hopefulwielder99> I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôll get better as both EAs continue, I liked the characters in Overprime but loved the gameplay loop on Predecessor
[2022-12-08 16:52:42] <NikitisDoesEverything> @bigo26shen you can earn them but there seems to be some confusion as to how easy that grind will be
[2022-12-08 16:52:46] <%+TruePlewd> @bigo26shen you canz but I think it currently takes something to like 50 wins to get a character with in-game currency

[2022-12-08 16:55:56] <Superweasel> 3 daily mission (100 currency each) and a weekly mission for 500 = 2600 currency/week. Most characters are 2000 currency. Zena costs more

[2022-12-08 16:56:12] <!%bobisha94> @Incon about the radius of the sphere is the range you can put it in front of you

[2022-12-08 16:56:20] <%dershbag> this whole buying individual heroes, ranked being locked behind how many heroes you own, and rotation heroes not counting toward ranked is really throwing a wrench in the people's argument that OP is better cus it's free lmao

[2022-12-08 17:06:41] <NikitisDoesEverything> @prince_tage there's a way to earn them, it'll be a grind but not awful
[2022-12-08 17:06:43] <Poobzee> @prince_tage yes, with money or in game currency
[2022-12-08 17:06:46] <%Un45aken> They all have to make money, long as I can grind for it I am fine
[2022-12-08 17:07:00] <+Dukeofwoodberry> league can do that because they were sort of the OG with DOTA, I don't think another can get away with it
[2022-12-08 17:07:00] <@%MichaelxVoorheees> technically correct is the best kind of correct
[2022-12-08 17:07:04] <+Dukeofwoodberry> but fair point
[2022-12-08 17:07:10] <%Un45aken> They should add a battle pass or something to get a few of them unlocked affordably
[2022-12-08 17:07:24] <+Dukeofwoodberry> you can't really grind this game

[2022-12-08 17:07:27] <%oiskeyp0iskey> basically, smite has a lot of problems, but the god pack is certainly not one of them
[2022-12-08 17:07:28] <prince_tage> @NikitisDoesEverything i see
[2022-12-08 17:07:30] <+DanklesD> People also act like you dont have to play LoL for months before you get high enough level for ranked. If it takes a while to unlock characters then it keeps uneducated people out of ranked
[2022-12-08 17:07:32] <+Dukeofwoodberry> they cap currency with challenges
[2022-12-08 17:07:33] <60hz_andy> are ADCs still really strong?
[2022-12-08 17:07:36] <Poobzee> currently 1 hero a week is bad but we'll see with the updates
[2022-12-08 17:07:39] <prince_tage> @Poobzee no god pack like smite?
[2022-12-08 17:07:41] <+Dukeofwoodberry> give you almost nothing for actually playing
[2022-12-08 17:07:50] <Poobzee> @prince_tage nope
[2022-12-08 17:07:57] <+Blushell> Their model is actually worse than Leagues.
[2022-12-08 17:07:59] <%Un45aken> @Dukeofwoodberry they are changing that to start giving per  game
[2022-12-08 17:08:04] <%Therion28> @Incon But League has Level requirement for ranked not a # of champions. Also League has their in game currency system ironed out while this game does not.
[2022-12-08 17:08:11] <NikitisDoesEverything> @Dukeofwoodberry they're adding currency per match today/tomorrow with the patch
[2022-12-08 17:08:18] <prince_tage> @Poobzee so exactly like league
[2022-12-08 17:08:22] <+Dukeofwoodberry> pretty small if I I had to guess
[2022-12-08 17:08:28] <+Dukeofwoodberry> we'll see if I'm wrong
[2022-12-08 17:08:38] <+DanklesD> @Therion28 League has also been out for over a generation
[2022-12-08 17:08:45] <+Dukeofwoodberry> that's outrageous that needed to be patched
[2022-12-08 17:08:46] <+DanklesD> decade*

[2022-12-08 17:08:58] <RandallRawrs> Doesn't matter how small.   I unlocked every single character in SMITE with favor.
[2022-12-08 17:09:05] <+madmaxcdn> Just played my first Overprime match - liked it alot. Predecessor has some genuine competition
[2022-12-08 17:09:07] <alphakappazero> YOOO this game is so much better than that other game
[2022-12-08 17:09:10] <RandallRawrs> I don't play SMITE anymore, but if I enjoy the game enough I can do it.
[2022-12-08 17:09:11] <%Un45aken> thats impressive
[2022-12-08 17:09:19] <%Un45aken> I paid like $10 when it was on sale
[2022-12-08 17:09:24] <%Un45aken> for all gods
[2022-12-08 17:09:24] <%+TruePlewd> I have every character with favor as well
[2022-12-08 17:09:28] <SlackAttacks> Thats like 5k game hours
[2022-12-08 17:09:34] <RandallRawrs> I have over 5k hours on
[2022-12-08 17:09:41] <%Debaucherous> says the man with 3M favor
[2022-12-08 17:09:45] <WinnaBango> I unlocked all the characters in Smite with favor on the PS4. Then I got a gaming PC and said never again.
[2022-12-08 17:09:47] <RandallRawrs> Probably closer to 6k
[2022-12-08 17:09:52] <+Dukeofwoodberry> I unlocked like every solo support with favor and my favorite jungles mids adcs
[2022-12-08 17:10:06] <%johnkeiwo> not even close
[2022-12-08 17:10:08] <%+Jagsman119> You probably spend more on electricity to earn every smite god with favor compared to the $30 to just get them all‚Ä¶.
[2022-12-08 17:10:08] <%oiskeyp0iskey> @Debaucherous to be fair he regrets most of those hours
[2022-12-08 17:10:11] <%Un45aken> People bitch about portals... i love them lol
[2022-12-08 17:10:11] <%johnkeiwo> I wasn't stressed AT ALL
[2022-12-08 17:10:13] <0usedpoptart0> thats like when i got most of the operators in Siege with Reknown

[2022-12-08 17:10:26] <%+bambm3634> y'all are crazy a founders pack was like 40 bucks lol
[2022-12-08 17:10:35] <+Dukeofwoodberry> the portals and sprint causes bad deathball game play
[2022-12-08 17:10:37] <RandallRawrs> @Jagsman119 I'm playing the game regardless. So I'd spend the money on the electric anyways...
[2022-12-08 17:10:37] <%Debaucherous> @oiskeyp0iskey Honestly, that's just life.
[2022-12-08 17:10:48] <WinnaBango> Is this a MOBA or just the new Pac-Man?
[2022-12-08 17:10:52] <Poobzee> @vanguardofhelen after you go through portal is on a cooldown
[2022-12-08 17:10:54] <NikitisDoesEverything> @vanguardofhelen it's a cooldown as soon as any character goes through
[2022-12-08 17:10:54] <%+Jagsman119> @randallrawrs fair fair
[2022-12-08 17:10:56] <+TheUniPhos> yo what up Lncon hehehehe
[2022-12-08 17:10:57] <+Dukeofwoodberry> at high level people will end games under 20 minutes and group and deathball quickly
[2022-12-08 17:10:57] <NikitisDoesEverything> 60 seconds
[2022-12-08 17:11:02] <+ImJokersDC> @WinnaBango Yes
[2022-12-08 17:11:10] <%vanguardofhelen> ah I see. nice
[2022-12-08 17:11:11] <Duelmother69> This game looks complicated
[2022-12-08 17:11:21] <%$GrumpeITiltSkin> this is smites bonus balance update
[2022-12-08 17:11:25] <+Dukeofwoodberry> it's actually pretty simple
[2022-12-08 17:11:31] <NikitisDoesEverything> LUL
[2022-12-08 17:11:35] <darkchocolatezombie> any significant improvements from the beta???
[2022-12-08 17:11:39] <BaconMageLv0> I have all characters with favour with only 1K hours, but yeah, it takes a while
[2022-12-08 17:11:41] <%Un45aken> that prime really had it out for you
[2022-12-08 17:11:52] <%Therion28> @DanklesD thats my point though, League did not have a direct competitor like overprime  has with Predicessor. (I mean a competitor using the same assets). Predicessor is for more free to play friendly
[2022-12-08 17:11:58] <+Dukeofwoodberry> compared to just about any other moba this is simple
[2022-12-08 17:12:09] <+Reign_TKO> DOTA2?
[2022-12-08 17:12:13] <@%MichaelxVoorheees> @darkchocolatezombie you can see their patch notes, a number of heros were buffed/nerfed, same with items, biggest point imo was prime cant kill core, it will dmg but not drop below 1%
[2022-12-08 17:12:24] <BaconMageLv0> still better than Unite though, their character unlocking has been getting so much worse recently, I dumped that game
[2022-12-08 17:12:29] <%+Jagsman119> Mobas are a complicated genre to learn in general
[2022-12-08 17:13:06] <0usedpoptart0> @BaconMageLv0 it was doomed as soon as it was a pokemon moba
[2022-12-08 17:13:10] <%vanguardofhelen> Can you jump over the gadget ground zapper line?
[2022-12-08 17:13:51] <%Un45aken> and people are toxic if you are not good
[2022-12-08 17:13:52] <%Un45aken> especially when you make it so hard to play ranked, you have top tier players playing with people learning right now
[2022-12-08 17:13:53] <BaconMageLv0> free currency inflation (with the company outright lying about planned prices), not letting you buy characters with the free currency for a week, not letting you buy the characters except with a bundle that includes skins, it's insane
[2022-12-08 17:13:53] <%+Jagsman119> Itemization plus learning 100+ heroes that each have like 5 or so abilities
[2022-12-08 17:14:09] <BaconMageLv0> @0usedpoptart0 personally, I would say "it was doomed as soon as it was a Pokemon MOBA *made by Tencent*"
[2022-12-08 17:14:13] <%johnkeiwo> so it does 30% of the core
[2022-12-08 17:14:16] <BaconMageLv0> those greedy mfs
[2022-12-08 17:14:22] <+Ezy_Pzy> is this better then predessor

[2022-12-08 17:15:12] <@%MichaelxVoorheees> it wont dmg the core past 1%
[2022-12-08 17:15:16] <+madmaxcdn> I kinda like how you can hide in the bushes like the boogeyman

[2022-12-08 17:34:46] <%+bossfrisone> @markgrimes4 All of the Smite GMs say Paragon is significantly better than Pred.  I think it's because of more map outplay with the portals on each side and stealth.

[2022-12-08 17:43:10] <%Esquire_Gaming_72> @Esquire_Gaming_72 blue and white with a splash of black are my go-to for artifacts; i've been wanting to make a Sisters commander deck for years
[2022-12-08 17:43:17] <@%jguy85> @Kelinesh i thank you
[2022-12-08 17:43:18] <%+bossfrisone> @NikitisDoesEverything we picked up the foil Pride Secret Lair this summer.  It has a limited Mana Confluence print I'm pretty stoked on.
[2022-12-08 17:43:22] <iriezeig> para pred or smite so far?
[2022-12-08 17:43:30] <%+bossfrisone> @Esquire_Gaming_72 didn't the sisters get reprinted?
[2022-12-08 17:43:45] <+Kelinesh> !pref @iriezeig
[2022-12-08 17:43:45] <@%^StreamElements> Incon has no preference to Pred vs Overprime
[2022-12-08 17:43:50] <%Esquire_Gaming_72> @bossfrisone if they did, not sure what set
[2022-12-08 17:43:53] <%oiskeyp0iskey> so you are saying UE5 is good for the environment
[2022-12-08 17:43:54] <%Debaucherous> my favorite thing in UE5 is the new rendering techniques. gonna make some GREAT looking worlds WITHOUT pop-in
[2022-12-08 17:43:54] <%+Yooman117> !moba
[2022-12-08 17:43:55] <@%^StreamElements> Incon is not done playing Smite! He plans to play Smite, Predecessor, and Overprime. Just because he is playing one does not mean he doesn't like the other two <3
[2022-12-08 17:44:03] <NikitisDoesEverything> @bossfrisone Oh sick!  I personally refuse to pay wizards for secret lairs but there are some really awesome ones out there
[2022-12-08 17:44:09] <%+bossfrisone> Black/blue/white.  I haven't built one of those yet.  Only thing that's rough with that is not having green for ramp.  Means an EXPENSIVE land base to make it work.  @Esquire_Gaming_72
[2022-12-08 17:44:16] <%philofyore> I feel like this is a good ol, #anythingbutSmite2023
[2022-12-08 17:44:21] <%+verictalosson> he's passive because he knows you'll just run into tower given the chance
[2022-12-08 17:44:24] <!%bobisha94> @Incon its like when they were talking about the engine for the division and they were talking about footprint and bullet hole rendering
[2022-12-08 17:44:30] <%+Jagsman119> That grenade ability looks so fun
[2022-12-08 17:44:36] <%+bossfrisone> @NikitisDoesEverything I don't blame you.  I picked up a fabricate secret lair for Emry.  The Phyrexian Tower kinda GOAT.
[2022-12-08 17:44:46] <%+kanego2113> well you ran straight at him with no regard for your life in the first 2 minutes.
[2022-12-08 17:44:46] <%Esquire_Gaming_72> @bossfrisone moxes help, myr if you're really in a pinch for some mana ramp help too
[2022-12-08 17:45:18] <%+bossfrisone> @Esquire_Gaming_72 Yeah I guess in an artifact build you're running all of the dual color artifacts, too.
[2022-12-08 17:45:32] <%johnkeiwo> so close
[2022-12-08 17:45:35] <sh_trev> Noooooooo
[2022-12-08 17:45:47] <%Esquire_Gaming_72> @bossfrisone exactly, plus you're prolly gonna run stuff to get artifacts out faster, or to reduce costs
[2022-12-08 17:45:52] <Sppllaarrtt> Just hit harder DendiFace
[2022-12-08 17:45:54] <BaconMageLv0> only hit point that matters is the last one
[2022-12-08 17:46:09] <%+bossfrisone> @MichaelxVoorheees can I post a Moxfield link to my Emry deck?
[2022-12-08 17:46:14] <%Esquire_Gaming_72> @bossfrisone like i have a white equipment deck that's based around getting equipment costs reduced and fetched
[2022-12-08 17:46:17] <@%MichaelxVoorheees> links are fine

[2022-12-08 17:48:53] <BaconMageLv0> Overprime crashes all the time for me
[2022-12-08 17:48:55] <silverzenith_> Predecessor looks cleaner.
[2022-12-08 17:48:56] <%$Amanipe> Op is a faster game
[2022-12-08 17:48:59] <Poobzee> i just like the actual moba feel. not a fan of tdm anymore
[2022-12-08 17:49:01] <%+Jagsman119> I just want one of them to do well, i dont care which
[2022-12-08 17:49:07] <raginmage69> I take it this has already been asked 12024239 times, but better than predecessor ?
[2022-12-08 17:49:10] <%+bossfrisone> @Esquire_Gaming_72 Right?  There are some CRAZY cEDH builds that people run for the whole turn 2 lockout.

[2022-12-08 17:49:24] <+madmaxcdn> OP has the potential I think to be the better game. Pred is my fav but they need to up their game.
[2022-12-08 17:49:27] <%tyrellthewise> its damn near neck and neck and nobody voted
[2022-12-08 17:49:27] <%+bossfrisone> @Esquire_Gaming_72 I thought it was just super cool to have a graveyard deck in blue.
[2022-12-08 17:49:30] <@%$air2jodran3> @raginmage69 it is subjective
[2022-12-08 17:49:30] <sh_trev> I think pred just feels good in the hand. Overprime offers more skin wise and stuff right now but just at core gameplay and pacing and as a MOBA I think pred has it. But both games can survive and be fun I think they are going two dif directions
[2022-12-08 17:49:30] <+Its_Pure_> they have talked about it
[2022-12-08 17:49:34] <%+verictalosson> OP feels a lot less snowball prone

[2022-12-08 17:49:49] <+kkingblm> ultimately I just want one to make it to console. hoping it is pred though. more of the OG paragon feel with i was obsessed with an got me into mobas

[2022-12-08 17:50:47] <%+bossfrisone> @Esquire_Gaming_72 Exactly!  I leaned into the draw card / discard route, rather than self-mill because the two combo pieces to abuse Emry for infinite card draw and mana aren't artifact.

[2022-12-08 17:52:38] <!%bobisha94> @Incon I think my main preference between the games is that I like how overprime abilities feel more than I like preds abilities.  For example, murdock shotgun in pred does more damage but in OP it does more knockback.  Muriel combo you overlap two abilities to make them explode whereas in predecessor the circle explodes automatically
[2022-12-08 17:52:38] <sh_trev> I think it just depends on what everyone wants. Either u want an arcade ish fighter face paced Overwatch type of game that‚Äôs Paragon the OP. OR you want the true MOBA pacing a little slower more tactical fighting and objective driven that‚Äôs Predecessor. Both good fun but just preference
[2022-12-08 17:52:40] <+H4pk0> op = teamfights neeeh pred= teamfights hell yeaahh
[2022-12-08 17:52:47] <+KnightbirdZ> Man.. I hate what they did to Murdocks E.  You basically Stunlock yourself
[2022-12-08 17:53:03] <%+bossfrisone> @Esquire_Gaming_72 It's always there.  We just need to remember it.
[2022-12-08 17:53:05] <%+pouncingpandaa> id rather pred win out, but either way im happy well have a paragon back
[2022-12-08 17:53:05] <%poopFATbaldOLD> Are some of the weird hiccups like in the final test
[2022-12-08 17:53:18] <%Esquire_Gaming_72> =)
[2022-12-08 17:53:23] <!%bobisha94> @Incon I prefer the prime mechanic in overprime MUCH more than the one in predecessor
[2022-12-08 17:53:31] <%+Jagsman119> I love that the prime guardian is just like a big monkey
[2022-12-08 17:53:41] <Im3Dy> Chat, How long is this early access test lasting?
[2022-12-08 17:53:53] <+madmaxcdn> @sh_trev This man gets it. Its just a preference thing.
[2022-12-08 17:53:59] <dillydill___> i love how all the Smite vets use Smite name equivalents for this game. Makes knowing wtf is going on much easier to digest
[2022-12-08 17:54:16] <sh_trev> @madmaxcdn Indeed my friend indeed
[2022-12-08 17:54:30] <+H4pk0> @Im3Dy i think it depends on the playerbase
[2022-12-08 17:54:42] <spudsthetuber> Anyone know if they changed AA damage for mages in this patch?
[2022-12-08 17:54:45] <sh_trev> All I know it once one hits console we streamin!!
[2022-12-08 17:54:45] <%+Yooman117> @Im3Dy Till full release
[2022-12-08 17:54:57] <@%MichaelxVoorheees> @spudsthetuber no
[2022-12-08 17:55:11] <spudsthetuber> Attack speed crit howie actually bops in Overprime if they didn't LUL LUL LUL
[2022-12-08 17:55:11] <%dershbag> Like those one items in Pred that I call Hydras and magical Hydras
[2022-12-08 17:55:19] <%The_Color_Twelve> its also the one the community knows the best
[2022-12-08 17:55:21] <!%bobisha94> @Incon that's why all old people say they are going to "xerox" something when they are going to make a copy of it because the xerox machine was used so often.
[2022-12-08 17:55:39] <Im3Dy> @Im3Dy Oh ty, so it's not like a weekend-only thing, we don't have an official end date? thanks
[2022-12-08 17:55:41] <+madmaxcdn> I like that OP doesn't have an autobuy option so you forced to learn the items quicker
[2022-12-08 17:55:45] <%andrewg117> @Incon they really need to nerf the hunters..
[2022-12-08 17:55:54] <+KnightbirdZ> @madmaxcdn turn it off?
[2022-12-08 17:56:01] <@%MichaelxVoorheees> @madmaxcdn ffs
[2022-12-08 17:56:05] <@%MichaelxVoorheees> oops
[2022-12-08 17:56:13] <@%MichaelxVoorheees> that was my dropping my phone i swear
[2022-12-08 17:56:16] <%+kanego2113> at 650 gold you can buy the t2 crit item and it'll put you over the threshold for the crit bonus
[2022-12-08 17:56:22] <spudsthetuber> @andrewg117 Wouldn't matter. You can build adc on a mage and still do insane damage.
[2022-12-08 17:56:24] <%Big_Headed_Gamer> @madmaxcdn wot....just turn the thing off....
[2022-12-08 17:56:28] <+mcpherson1996> Teleporters are no fun
[2022-12-08 17:56:30] <%Big_Headed_Gamer> danKEK
[2022-12-08 17:56:30] <@%MichaelxVoorheees> but i disagree. there should be auto buy so you learn the character adn THEN you can learn items in teh store between q
[2022-12-08 17:56:37] <@%MichaelxVoorheees> also yea you l iterally can just turn it off
[2022-12-08 17:56:54] <+madmaxcdn> Yeah I know you can turn off the autobuy but if you're lazy you just leave it on you know
[2022-12-08 17:56:57] <%Big_Headed_Gamer> auto buy is good if you can make custom builds like smite :D
[2022-12-08 17:56:59] <%+kanego2113> how many assists til it counts as a kill?
[2022-12-08 17:57:02] <MrJackems> Show dmg
[2022-12-08 17:57:08] <%Big_Headed_Gamer> i also want custom auto leveling like smite has :D
[2022-12-08 17:57:09] <%+Jagsman119> Yes but lass had 15 more gold than yo that match so who is the real qinner
[2022-12-08 17:57:14] <dillydill___> I need to know what you, samdude, and andy are planning to call the pro team so i can get my first forehead tat @Incon
[2022-12-08 17:57:21] <TxReckless666> is op ranked still duo q?
[2022-12-08 17:57:22] <!%bobisha94> i typically go 2 for 1
[2022-12-08 17:57:44] <+lceguy> do you like the game?
[2022-12-08 17:57:59] <%Big_Headed_Gamer> @TxReckless666 it's ranked dependant and can't do placements as a duo either but ranked play is locked behind an insane grindwall.
[2022-12-08 17:58:01] <!%bobisha94> @Incon got it, steal all my ADC's kills as a support
[2022-12-08 17:58:08] <%+TruePlewd> that's why I play Steel support. still getting my top kills and you will feel supported

[2022-12-08 17:58:35] <%THEDILLYWIGGLE> Goodmorning Incon
[2022-12-08 17:58:36] <!%bobisha94> @Incon can I tie a quarter to a string and get characters for free?
[2022-12-08 17:58:38] <%Esquire_Gaming_72> @Jagsman119 if not Western Union
[2022-12-08 17:58:46] <TxReckless666> @TxReckless666 thats lame but i get it
[2022-12-08 17:58:54] <dillydill___> @THEDILLYWIGGLE imposter
[2022-12-08 17:59:01] <%Esquire_Gaming_72> @Jagsman119 i have some Saudi Prince connections that make it super easy to transfer money
[2022-12-08 17:59:05] <%THEDILLYWIGGLE> Lmao nice name
[2022-12-08 17:59:13] <dillydill___> no u
[2022-12-08 17:59:17] <!%bobisha94> feng mao incoming
[2022-12-08 17:59:27] <%THEDILLYWIGGLE> Honestly surprised people like Pred more than OP
[2022-12-08 17:59:37] <%+kanego2113> jungle is pretty easy in this game... farm until 8 minutes and solo the underling and drop in lane to win
[2022-12-08 17:59:39] <Von_Brohenheim> Do you know if there are any plans for this or predecessor to be on console?
[2022-12-08 17:59:48] <HelzNight> how long does it take to earn enough ingame points to buy someone
[2022-12-08 17:59:55] <Poobzee> @Von_Brohenheim both will be
[2022-12-08 18:00:02] <dillydill___> i havent played either, the description i got is OP is more battleground and Pred is more traditional moba. Is this accurate?
[2022-12-08 18:00:11] <%+TruePlewd> Steel has jungle potential, but it's a little slow to start. his ganks are fire though lol
[2022-12-08 18:00:13] <%$Amanipe> Zena and Feng had been pretty nerfed in jungle since the release fyi, if you didn't check the patch note
[2022-12-08 18:00:15] <+Feyded> they need to buff the PVE in this game
[2022-12-08 18:00:20] <%+hlp_hlp_my_leg> i would like overprine if it didnt have the run system
[2022-12-08 18:00:22] <+Feyded> the pve seems to easy to kill
[2022-12-08 18:00:27] <Poobzee> @dillydill___ accurate
[2022-12-08 18:00:28] <spudsthetuber> As of tomorrow LUL  Definitely had to get that day one moneys.
[2022-12-08 18:00:33] <%THEDILLYWIGGLE> Oh thank the lord its ridiculous how long it takes to earn characters
[2022-12-08 18:00:40] <jansson484> i believe they said everything will be 30% cheaper
[2022-12-08 18:00:57] <%THEDILLYWIGGLE> Level the right click first!
[2022-12-08 18:01:04] <%THEDILLYWIGGLE> Does the most damage by far
[2022-12-08 18:01:12] <spudsthetuber> @Incon iirc her right click fires on release since it's a charge.
[2022-12-08 18:01:16] <Ogtoma> xena is nefted but still OP af
[2022-12-08 18:01:44] <+KnightbirdZ> @THEDILLYWIGGLE Not hard to really.  One is more focused on running around really fast to get into fights, the other is concetrating on laning and punishes for not.   MOBA vs Battle Arena that Looks liek a MOBA :D lol
[2022-12-08 18:02:03] <%$Amanipe> her skills are really OP yes. But her damages nerfed her jungle clear
[2022-12-08 18:02:16] <+jorge_mirando> The game has potential to be a good moba?
[2022-12-08 18:02:31] <+KnightbirdZ> Its all about Preference t hough.
[2022-12-08 18:02:46] <THEDILLYWIGGLE> @THEDILLYWIGGLE Definitely not true. If it were a true battle arena then there wouldnt be farming and items. Mobas are based around farm and objectives
[2022-12-08 18:02:49] <TxReckless666> how are the hunters still op?
[2022-12-08 18:02:53] <%THEDILLYWIGGLE> Both are mobas
[2022-12-08 18:03:19] <SwabDog> jung diff
[2022-12-08 18:03:20] <+FoolWitDaSnoW> Incon liking this more than pred?
[2022-12-08 18:03:24] <%Debaucherous> He very quickly realized he wasn't going to win that and just gave up
[2022-12-08 18:03:28] <Ogtoma> zena have too many HP at the beggining of the game
[2022-12-08 18:03:37] <SwabDog> omg lul
[2022-12-08 18:03:42] <%+Ymmit354> he wanted the buff you just bullied him
[2022-12-08 18:03:49] <%+Jagsman119> Interesting executive decision feng
[2022-12-08 18:03:58] <%THEDILLYWIGGLE> @THEDILLYWIGGLE Also u realize MOBA stands for Multiplayer Online Battle arena so both are technically battle arenas
[2022-12-08 18:03:59] <SwabDog> idk either LOL
[2022-12-08 18:04:13] <+KnightbirdZ> @THEDILLYWIGGLE I didnt say OP wasnt a MOBA.  It just focuses on different things.  OP wants you to get into team fights, Pred doesnt.   So OP feels like a battle arena cause you are constantly fighting.
[2022-12-08 18:04:17] <+lceguy> look fast game
[2022-12-08 18:04:18] <%Un45aken> how dare he try to jungle the jungle you are already jungling
[2022-12-08 18:04:19] <!%bobisha94> @Incon because he's insane
[2022-12-08 18:04:23] <!%bobisha94> by definition
[2022-12-08 18:04:25] <Poobzee> but there's definitely an established moba playstyle that this strays far from. its semantics at this point @THEDILLYWIGGLE
[2022-12-08 18:04:30] <@%^StreamElements> Support the twitchiest community and use code 'Incon' for 20% off your order! https://gfuel.ly/2Uq4LVI
[2022-12-08 18:04:53] <+KnightbirdZ> @THEDILLYWIGGLE Yeah I do.  Just pointing out the reasons for peoples preferences between the games.
[2022-12-08 18:05:00] <@%^StreamElements> Buy your gems and videogames here and support the twitchiest community(All Platforms) https://www.nexus.gg/incon/in-game-content
[2022-12-08 18:05:07] <%+Jagsman119> That was very rude of feng for trying to take your second jungle @incon
[2022-12-08 18:05:09] <+FoolWitDaSnoW> This is like playing arenas in smite pred is like conquest. OP is fun for a little while, pred has a huge ceiling and more strategy
[2022-12-08 18:05:09] <heridh> that was a mechanic Kappa
[2022-12-08 18:05:09] <+Bmwhite3> Solid servers LUL
[2022-12-08 18:05:17] <spudsthetuber> At least they're not Hirez servers yet.
[2022-12-08 18:05:36] <%Raxiuss> +
[2022-12-08 18:05:45] <raginmage69> @FoolWitDaSnoW interesting, I haven't seen a whole lot of either but that's quite the difference
[2022-12-08 18:05:46] <spudsthetuber> I really think the technical difficulties the game has might be the downfall for OP.
[2022-12-08 18:05:46] <+TruePlewd> the servers rubber banding on quick movement is a HUGE issue
[2022-12-08 18:05:51] <+KnightbirdZ> Dont get me wrong, I actually like OP.  Jumping int a game to just run around and kill things is fun.  But Im not anxious at all.. Like i dont worry while playing OP
[2022-12-08 18:05:58] <teki9ne> I don't know, but despite both aspects of the two, I still don't take my preference away from the OP inconRNG
[2022-12-08 18:06:06] <+KnightbirdZ> I worry alot in Pred cause I know if I die we might lose.  If you die here, its not a big deal.
[2022-12-08 18:06:15] <raginmage69> @KnightbirdZ If you're not gaming for anxiety and to rage are you really even gaming ?
[2022-12-08 18:06:17] <%Raxiuss> LNCON coming at yaaaa
[2022-12-08 18:06:22] <%Raxiuss> inconLincoln
[2022-12-08 18:06:22] <+MacncheeseZ> This is not an arena game. It‚Äôs a moba
[2022-12-08 18:06:29] <+KnightbirdZ> @KnightbirdZ lmaaoo exactly ! :D
[2022-12-08 18:06:41] <Poobzee> @MacncheeseZ ehh
[2022-12-08 18:06:47] <teki9ne> @MacncheeseZ up!
[2022-12-08 18:07:00] <+FoolWitDaSnoW> @macncheesez Barely, technically yes but it‚Äôs not really strategically a moba. OW is kinda a moba too
[2022-12-08 18:07:06] <%dershbag> @KnightbirdZ See imo it's a lot easier to make comebacks in Pred while it's easier to snowball in OP
[2022-12-08 18:07:07] <GrandpaKeif> @knightbirdz Would a legit ranked mode change that at all? Cause I feel the same with overwatch but become sweaty in ranked
[2022-12-08 18:07:17] <%+Jagsman119> Feng reslly needs to stop contesting your second jungle inconCreep
[2022-12-08 18:07:19] <+blacksunofdeath> paragon or predecessor?

[2022-12-08 18:07:27] <%hiratik> Nice 3D Fiora
[2022-12-08 18:07:33] <spudsthetuber> That's so nice of you guys to help that person to remind them to buy items.
[2022-12-08 18:07:33] <%Debaucherous> Incon is from Sumaria confirmed
[2022-12-08 18:07:43] <megatrade1> this game is hot
[2022-12-08 18:07:54] <heridh> good boy Kappa
[2022-12-08 18:08:01] <teki9ne> this game is very hot
[2022-12-08 18:08:03] <megatrade1> <3
[2022-12-08 18:08:07] <+KnightbirdZ> @GrandpaKeif Yeah a Ranked mode is gonna create that atmosphere, sure.  Good players vs Good players always does that.  I just think OP doesnt FOCUS on specific things that I like Pred does.  Thats all
[2022-12-08 18:08:12] <Mantequi1la> Seems like dashes are super op combined with travel mode
[2022-12-08 18:08:12] <+KnightbirdZ> @blacksunofdeath Both! :D
[2022-12-08 18:08:37] <+MacncheeseZ> Overwatch isn‚Äôt a moba. It‚Äôs a first person shooter with pushing objectives
[2022-12-08 18:09:23] <SwabDog> is overprime an extension of paragon?
[2022-12-08 18:09:29] <+MacncheeseZ> Overprime is strategically a moba. It has all the aspects as smite and league of legends with the jungle, towers, minions, and team fights
[2022-12-08 18:09:32] <+Dukeofwoodberry> I really don't see this going anywhere in NA unless they make significant monetization changes
[2022-12-08 18:09:36] <%Debaucherous> !paragon
[2022-12-08 18:09:36] <@%MichaelxVoorheees> !paragon
[2022-12-08 18:09:36] <@%^StreamElements> Epic Games released assets to their old game Paragon. Predecessor and Paragon: The OverPrime (both available today on PC for Early Access) and plan to be on console when they fully release, no ETA yet
[2022-12-08 18:09:37] <%dershbag> this character with her lore is peak asian. a sword wielding isekai pop star?
[2022-12-08 18:09:38] <+FoolWitDaSnoW> @macncheesez But they say they have moba elements, like this game. It has elements but you just brawl like an arena. Words are arbitrary it doesn‚Äôt matter this is a mindless brawl pred is a more classic moba most of us want
[2022-12-08 18:09:38] <Poobzee> @MacncheeseZ its technically a moba. multiplayer online battle arena. and this plays more like overwatch
[2022-12-08 18:09:39] <%Debaucherous> !overprime
[2022-12-08 18:09:45] <spudsthetuber> @SwabDog No, not at all. Paragon is dead and gone and this is nothing like it.
[2022-12-08 18:09:46] <+KnightbirdZ> @SwabDog As far as Assets and a bit of the map, yeah.
[2022-12-08 18:09:49] <SwabDog> tyy
[2022-12-08 18:10:06] <%Raxiuss> You sort of live in his jungle, Incon. I think we know why he's not doing those camps LUL poor guy
[2022-12-08 18:10:13] <+Dukeofwoodberry> I'd rather just play overwatch if it's not a moba
[2022-12-08 18:10:19] <Poobzee> @MacncheeseZ sure it has lanes and pve but its not the focus at all
[2022-12-08 18:10:37] <Mantequi1la> Do you know fi Overprime is using Unreal engine 5?
[2022-12-08 18:10:40] <+Blushell> Paragon is alive. Its spirit lives on in Predecessor.
[2022-12-08 18:10:41] <%Randomlea> this character is mad aesthetic, especially the run animation
[2022-12-08 18:10:42] <%Debaucherous> @SwabDog It's a little disingenuous to say it's nothing like it. It uses the same assets and is literally called "Paragon: The Overprime"
[2022-12-08 18:10:44] <%hiratik> So do you finally have some preferences after playing Pred last week and OP today? I know there¬¥s the command for no preferences but do you feel inclined towards some of them more? @Incon
[2022-12-08 18:10:51] <spudsthetuber> @Mantequi1la It is not.
[2022-12-08 18:10:59] <%+Jagsman119> @mantequi1la op is ue4, pred is ue5
[2022-12-08 18:11:18] <Mantequi1la> I wonder if its easy to transition between engines
[2022-12-08 18:11:27] <xXCloudAtlasXx0> I voted and missed the answer @in. Who won?
[2022-12-08 18:11:31] <+MacncheeseZ> @poobzee that is the worst take I‚Äôve heard. Completely different games. Paragon has a map that is distinguishable as a moba. It‚Äôs team fights are like MOBAs. Overwatch is constant fighting focusing on aiming and precision
[2022-12-08 18:11:35] <SwabDog> @SwabDog i see. thank you for the clarity! :)
[2022-12-08 18:11:50] <megatrade1> MyAvatar
[2022-12-08 18:11:55] <!%bobisha94> @Incon do you think that OP and Pred will scratch different itches or are they both equal in that way too?
[2022-12-08 18:11:56] <+xClippy> cant have it both ways
[2022-12-08 18:12:00] <GrandpaKeif> Everyone‚Äôs trying to rush preference. It‚Äôll only take a year for one to fully have all the attention.

[2022-12-08 18:12:08] <%+pouncingpandaa> idc about content at a launch moba much
[2022-12-08 18:12:13] <%+lightforceten> @incon which game‚Äôs developer would you rather partner with?
[2022-12-08 18:12:13] <Mantequi1la> I would say thats a fair take, except Overprime is currently fully released. Pred is in Early access
[2022-12-08 18:12:19] <%Un45aken> comes down to who can improve their game more better
[2022-12-08 18:12:20] <%hiratik> @GrandpaKeif Yea solid point as well.
[2022-12-08 18:12:23] <@%$air2jodran3> @Mantequi1la they are both in EA
[2022-12-08 18:12:26] <xXCloudAtlasXx0> @air2jodran3 Thanks
[2022-12-08 18:12:38] <Fennicks47> idk, watching these games makes me really dislike travel mode, all oevr again
[2022-12-08 18:12:45] <+zewlawk> Currently Predecessor is inferior is every way outside of the bundle that gives all champs
[2022-12-08 18:12:47] <+MacncheeseZ> Overwatch is technically a first person shooter. Go google please. And yes, the objective of Paragon is the same as any moba. Lanes and minions and the jungle is the focus
[2022-12-08 18:12:54] <+FoolWitDaSnoW> I promise you when early access for pred ends and it drops f2p with all the player retention features and on console this game is done in NA/EU
[2022-12-08 18:12:54] <@%MichaelxVoorheees> @zewlawk ok
[2022-12-08 18:12:57] <+KnightbirdZ> @zewlawk lmao
[2022-12-08 18:12:59] <icsdue> also saying a game is EA doesn't mean that much anymore
[2022-12-08 18:13:00] <+Feyded> they needa buff this thing
[2022-12-08 18:13:02] <Poobzee> @MacncheeseZ again it may have the map, but it plays more like overwatch. you can see it here. fights are nothing like other typical mobas
[2022-12-08 18:13:18] <sirsleepysquid> the items in pred give you much more room for experimentation in my opinion
[2022-12-08 18:13:29] [Notification] jjspear subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 6 months!
[2022-12-08 18:13:30] <Mantequi1la> @air2jodran3 Ah i thought they went full release.
[2022-12-08 18:13:39] <Fennicks47> @Poobzee i have no idea what you mean by that tbh
[2022-12-08 18:13:42] [Notification] KnightbirdZ subscribed with Prime.
[2022-12-08 18:13:42] <+Pooper_Scoooper> The sprint feature is terrrrrble for gameplay
[2022-12-08 18:13:48] <%Debaucherous> Overwatch has never been considered a moba outside of the occasional hot take by random people. It's always fallen into the TF2 category of character shooter.
[2022-12-08 18:13:51] <%Danger_Corpse> I'm so tired.
[2022-12-08 18:13:55] <+MacncheeseZ> @poobzee umm yes the fights are the same except OP has verticality. Team fights are team fights. You make no sense
[2022-12-08 18:13:58] <+FoolWitDaSnoW> This game is a brawler, way less strategy. The sprint, portals and smaller map all push constant fights
[2022-12-08 18:13:59] <%Danger_Corpse> Please release me from this mortal flesh prison.
[2022-12-08 18:14:00] <%+KnightbirdZ> :)
[2022-12-08 18:14:00] <raginmage69> Do I need a legit gaming PC to play OP or Pred ? I have just a regular everyday desktop
[2022-12-08 18:14:07] <%Danger_Corpse> So how is everyone today?
[2022-12-08 18:14:15] <+FoolWitDaSnoW> @macncheesez You just seem confused
[2022-12-08 18:14:16] <SwabDog> 3060?
[2022-12-08 18:14:19] <Mantequi1la> @Debaucherous Its a direct TF2 copy LUL
[2022-12-08 18:14:25] <+zewlawk> @KnightbirdZ change my mind, the game has 0 energy compared to Overprime as it stands. played both last night. will be interested to see where Pred is in a year
[2022-12-08 18:14:34] <@%MichaelxVoorheees> !diff
[2022-12-08 18:14:35] <@%^StreamElements> different mechanics for game, some heros have different abilities, pred heros have passives, diff ui and store items, map, buffs, overprime has a sprint. etc etc !compare
[2022-12-08 18:14:39] <@%MichaelxVoorheees> !compare
[2022-12-08 18:14:39] <@%^StreamElements> Incon has described Predecessor as a traditional MOBA while Overprime plays more like an arena shooter with a hint of MOBA gameplay.
[2022-12-08 18:14:40] <%dershbag> !gamingpc
[2022-12-08 18:14:41] <Poobzee> @MacncheeseZ in typical mobas you have to plan for team fights. in this like overwatch you're safe to run around and start one
[2022-12-08 18:14:42] <%THEDILLYWIGGLE> @sirsleepysquid I would disagree since Pred has only 5 item slots as opposed to 6 in OP. I will say the items in Pred seem to be more intricate tho
[2022-12-08 18:14:42] <GrandpaKeif> Yeah people kinda underestimate how much console is gonna boost either game depending on how it‚Äôll perform. Like I think half or more of paragon players were exclusively console.
[2022-12-08 18:14:43] <@%MichaelxVoorheees> bam. done
[2022-12-08 18:14:44] <%johnkeiwo> can you still upgrade the starter ?
[2022-12-08 18:14:47] <+Bmwhite3> @swabdog I play pred on a 3060 high settings 120+ fps easy
[2022-12-08 18:14:56] <%+Ymmit354> to be fair predecessor has had way more funding than OP
[2022-12-08 18:14:58] <%Un45aken> At the end of the day, whichever has more players, has better matchmaking, will be played more
[2022-12-08 18:15:01] <MRCY_Fuba> i play on a 1060 you dont need a poweful computer it will run fine
[2022-12-08 18:15:02] <%Debaucherous> @Debaucherous Certainly not direct.. but also definitely inspired.
[2022-12-08 18:15:12] <linxster007> What it do scooby do
[2022-12-08 18:15:14] <Mantequi1la> @GrandpaKeif I think Og paragon had more player on console than on pc
[2022-12-08 18:15:16] <%hiratik> I played first 2 games last night and I sucked so much. I haven¬¥t played Smite this year at all so even the remnants of some skill are gone
[2022-12-08 18:15:24] <+FoolWitDaSnoW> @zewlawk We knew this was the case when pred dropped tho, they will push the game and advertise more when they have key player retention features
[2022-12-08 18:15:25] <%+KnightbirdZ> @zewlawk I cant change your mind if you dont enjoy the gameplay.  All good though bud.  Best I've got is Pred isnt about ACTION ACTION ACTION.  Its about slow methodically laning and then a team fight here and there, ganking, and then taking core.
[2022-12-08 18:15:29] <@%MichaelxVoorheees> you can go ahead and change your statement to an opinion rather than facts of lacking now.
[2022-12-08 18:15:38] <%+gilmordor3791> Hey @Incon how are you doing today?
[2022-12-08 18:15:44] <%+Burntpeter> i need to play Overprime again. Im not sure which one i like better after playing pred for a bit.
[2022-12-08 18:15:46] <heridh> yeah I am running this game fine in a gtx750ti
[2022-12-08 18:15:55] <Fennicks47> @KnightbirdZ ppl say this, but all of my pred games have been 1.5-2 kills per minute.
[2022-12-08 18:15:58] <+Its_Pure_> @ymmit354 overprimenis owned by net marble,  they've worth millions.bfunding is not an issue
[2022-12-08 18:15:59] <+MacncheeseZ> @poobzee you can do the same in any moba. You‚Äôre not safe, because the enemy team will most always follow up and fight you to back up their teammate
[2022-12-08 18:16:18] <%dershbag> @Ymmit354 that's not really a great argument in this case though considering OP is developed and published by Netmarble one of the biggest international game companies
[2022-12-08 18:16:24] <%+gilmordor3791> Just lost my job so not great
[2022-12-08 18:16:24] <%+Jagsman119> What exactly does her ult do?
[2022-12-08 18:16:35] <@%MichaelxVoorheees> @Jagsman119 murder inconDerp
[2022-12-08 18:16:41] <%hiratik> The UI looks so much better xD
[2022-12-08 18:16:45] <+oksilkyy> So people picked pred over OP huh?
[2022-12-08 18:16:49] <Rebo0t> !nexus
[2022-12-08 18:16:49] <@%^StreamElements> Buy your gems and videogames here and support the twitchiest community(All Platforms) https://www.nexus.gg/incon/in-game-content
[2022-12-08 18:16:50] <Fennicks47> @Jagsman119 hits random targets 5 times for dmg.
[2022-12-08 18:16:52] <%+KnightbirdZ> @Fennicks47 Because you can still run around killing in the game.  You just might not win.  If you play safer and let those people dive you and you have a good team who ganks and plays rigth you will win
[2022-12-08 18:16:54] <+Tagord96> Which game has ranked? Pred or OP?
[2022-12-08 18:16:59] <@%MichaelxVoorheees> OP
[2022-12-08 18:17:02] <%Esquire_Gaming_72> @gilmordor3791 sorry to hear that =(

[2022-12-08 18:17:05] <+MacncheeseZ> Op
[2022-12-08 18:17:08] <+zewlawk> @KnightbirdZ fair fair, i wanna see where it ends up down the line for sure. I dont like netmarble and would love for pred to get more polish once outta alpha
[2022-12-08 18:17:14] <%+Jagsman119> @michaelxvoorheees ahhh, the best type of ult
[2022-12-08 18:17:14] <%+TruePlewd> @dershbag they also have a bad reputation with live game environments though.
[2022-12-08 18:17:16] <BaconMageLv0> @Jagsman119 5 hits of physical damage, each one shredding defense, and the last hit targets everyone in range
[2022-12-08 18:17:18] <Poobzee> @MacncheeseZ dying in this is not nearly as detrimental in other mobas. you can rejoin the fight and push back. in typical mobas, you are punished dearly for falling behind
[2022-12-08 18:17:20] <+Bmwhite3> @hiratik that‚Äôs something pred team has stated, they back seated the ui to focus on gameplay and EA
[2022-12-08 18:17:28] <+MacncheeseZ> Predecessor has no leveling or progression
[2022-12-08 18:17:30] <BaconMageLv0> while the first four hit randomly
[2022-12-08 18:17:32] <%+killerInstinct582> what was that for?
[2022-12-08 18:17:33] <@%MichaelxVoorheees> yet
[2022-12-08 18:17:34] <+Blushell> You cant play ranked in OP without coughing up money anyway
[2022-12-08 18:17:39] <%+KnightbirdZ> @zewlawk For sure.  A lot of stuff will be added during Early Access for Pred in the next 6 months. So only good things imo
[2022-12-08 18:17:39] <@%MichaelxVoorheees> they literally plan to
[2022-12-08 18:17:40] <spudsthetuber> @zewlawk It's extremely polished, do you mean more reasons to play the game?
[2022-12-08 18:17:42] <%Un45aken> If Pred makes it to console first, that will be good for its player base.
[2022-12-08 18:17:46] <Fennicks47> @KnightbirdZ are you saying objectives have more impact? i keep seeing these 'ation game vs moba' claims,and, having played both, i dont see the difff.
[2022-12-08 18:17:49] <%dershbag> @TruePlewd correct. my friends and I were just talking about that.
[2022-12-08 18:17:51] <%+gilmordor3791> Yikes, she has scary burst

[2022-12-08 18:18:11] <%+Jagsman119> Her sound fx are really nice.
[2022-12-08 18:18:18] <+Claybourne> this character is busted, holy cow
[2022-12-08 18:18:20] <%HerculesMWP> Incon please, have mercy
[2022-12-08 18:18:23] <Mantequi1la> @Its_Pure_ i would say funding is conditional with larger developers. EPIC could have shelved the project but left it open source due to a business decision to allocate all resources to fortnite. Larger developer will 100% drop a project if it doesnt meet quotas
[2022-12-08 18:18:53] <+zewlawk> love the last hit sound
[2022-12-08 18:19:03] <Poobzee> @MacncheeseZ no you can ignore minions and go straight for a fight
[2022-12-08 18:19:13] <+dark__woof> Only thing I want is riktor lol
[2022-12-08 18:19:16] <%hiratik> @Incon Kind sir, would you please recommend some good series to watch?
[2022-12-08 18:19:18] <+Its_Pure_> announcer voice is better, but yeah that delay
[2022-12-08 18:19:20] <+MacncheeseZ> @poobzee try playing a different moba besides smite for once sheesh
[2022-12-08 18:19:30] <TstMomo> yeh i'd love for pred to work on the sounds a bit more. especially for autos on certain heroes
[2022-12-08 18:19:34] <%+KnightbirdZ> lol yeah we killed an entire team and for like.. a minute the announcer kept saying "An Ally killed an enemy" or w/e lmao
[2022-12-08 18:19:34] <Mantequi1la> It like playing wow with all suggested addons installed
[2022-12-08 18:19:39] <+MacncheeseZ> @poobzee you can do the same in any moba. Still have no argument bud
[2022-12-08 18:19:39] <Mantequi1la> Thew annoucer
[2022-12-08 18:19:47] <BaconMageLv0> literally the first thing Incon did last game was focus on the enemy over the minions with barely any penalty
[2022-12-08 18:20:14] <Fennicks47> @BaconMageLv0 except he also got almost every last hit..?
[2022-12-08 18:20:26] <BaconMageLv0> yes
[2022-12-08 18:20:43] <@%MichaelxVoorheees> its all in the hips
[2022-12-08 18:20:48] <%+poll0_loc0> Incon be channeling all his Smite hatred
[2022-12-08 18:20:49] <%Un45aken> I love having a sprint
[2022-12-08 18:20:51] <Poobzee> @MacncheeseZ no in other mobas you should be farming to get an advantage early
[2022-12-08 18:20:52] <Stonewall1824> prefer this or predecesor?
[2022-12-08 18:20:56] <%Un45aken> get last hits in this is 10x easier than pred though
[2022-12-08 18:20:57] <+Claybourne> the real deciding factor for me on Pred or OP, is the fact that OP absolutely murdered my boy Howi. He looks awful in this game.
[2022-12-08 18:20:59] <@%MichaelxVoorheees> !pred
[2022-12-08 18:20:59] <@%^StreamElements> HELLO CHAT! Predecessor is currently in Early Access! This means you will have to buy one of the bundles to play it! Minimum is $10! The game WILL be free to play on release! Enjoy!

[2022-12-08 18:21:14] <%+hlp_hlp_my_leg> idk but this game feels more like a team death match first then a moba
[2022-12-08 18:21:22] <%+KnightbirdZ> @Claybourne yeah my poor boy howie :(  plus i really love his KIT in pred better
[2022-12-08 18:21:23] <@%MichaelxVoorheees> !compare

[2022-12-08 18:21:34] <%+swiftjohnny117> but the last hits are auto execute under like 20% hp
[2022-12-08 18:21:34] <@%MichaelxVoorheees> @hlp_hlp_my_leg pretty much what he has said
[2022-12-08 18:21:34] <%Danger_Corpse> More time is needed to find me an arena match. Gooooood sign.

[2022-12-08 18:21:58] <Mantequi1la> @Claybourne His ult in OP is just bad lol
[2022-12-08 18:22:05] <+MacncheeseZ> @poobzee last hitting is essential in this game just like league of legends. League of legends is the same as this game when it comes to Pvp vs Pve
[2022-12-08 18:22:08] <spudsthetuber> That's a big yikers on how far you travel back from that lol
[2022-12-08 18:22:11] <BaconMageLv0> I was more just making a point that the gameplay contradicted the arguments made in chat
[2022-12-08 18:22:14] <%+KnightbirdZ> yeah the server lag is reaaal in OP.  They can fix it eventually, hopefully
[2022-12-08 18:22:39] <+Claybourne> @Claybourne I haven't seen it yet. What does it do?
[2022-12-08 18:22:45] <Poobzee> @MacncheeseZ yes but not so much on minions or camps. you are fighting heroes constantly
[2022-12-08 18:22:56] <%Debaucherous> Does the last hit of your ult NOT hit the initial target?
[2022-12-08 18:23:05] <%+Arnamik> I wonder if they bought some old Hi-Rez servers to use for thjis xD
[2022-12-08 18:23:12] <%poopFATbaldOLD> Is it true that all the servers for this game are in Asia?
[2022-12-08 18:23:16] <%Raxiuss> that sounds so counterintuitive @Incon but then I realize the autos are basically hitscan LUL
[2022-12-08 18:23:25] <Poobzee> @MacncheeseZ in league you are way more calculated and strategic. people aren't running everywhere from the get go
[2022-12-08 18:23:25] <Anonghostxx> @poopFATbaldOLD no
[2022-12-08 18:23:26] <@%MichaelxVoorheees> but incon! your extended warranty!
[2022-12-08 18:23:29] <%+KnightbirdZ> @poopFATbaldOLD no they are around the world
[2022-12-08 18:23:32] <BaconMageLv0> @Claybourne targets a large circle and rains down rockets for about 3 seconds
[2022-12-08 18:23:33] <!%bobisha94> @Incon was the suspected spam at least fried?
[2022-12-08 18:23:33] <+dark__woof> Howitzer is just an easier character in pred, the auto lock ult is just a guaranteed kill
[2022-12-08 18:23:34] <%philofyore> Better call them back, @Incon It could be about your car's limited warranty!
[2022-12-08 18:23:39] <%Debaucherous> @poopFATbaldOLD There are US W and US E servers
[2022-12-08 18:23:42] <Wook1n> this character is dope
[2022-12-08 18:23:48] <BaconMageLv0> anyone still in the circle at the end takes a large burst of damage
[2022-12-08 18:23:51] <spudsthetuber> @Claybourne It's his original Paragon ult. drops bunch of damage in an area with a giant burst at the end but it's hard ot hit unless you have CC
[2022-12-08 18:23:56] <@%MichaelxVoorheees> i dont like the portals in this
[2022-12-08 18:23:56] <%johnkeiwo> not even close !

[2022-12-08 18:24:02] <Fennicks47> @dark__woof his knockup and slow arent targetted, hes way harder in pred
[2022-12-08 18:24:02] <@%MichaelxVoorheees> you should have died there
[2022-12-08 18:24:02] <%+Jagsman119> What role is objective secure in this game?
[2022-12-08 18:24:09] <@%MichaelxVoorheees> @Jagsman119 jungle
[2022-12-08 18:24:17] <+Claybourne> Ah ok. That sucks. His new ult in Pred is so good.
[2022-12-08 18:24:50] <Fennicks47> @Claybourne i think the og howie 'big aoe' ult overlapped too much with gadget and gideon. too 'sameyh'
[2022-12-08 18:24:50] <+dark__woof> @fennicks47 there‚Äôs no way lol the amount of kills I‚Äôve gotten with him in pred compared to overprime is twice the amount, his kit is so easy in pred
[2022-12-08 18:25:06] <%+poll0_loc0> Does the portal connect both objectives? Or only prime to stag?
[2022-12-08 18:25:24] <Fennicks47> @dark__woof i mean,  his knockup and slow are much much much easier to use in OP than pred.
[2022-12-08 18:25:38] <%philofyore> I thought that jungle minion was  a water bear for a second
[2022-12-08 18:25:40] <%philofyore> That'd be cute
[2022-12-08 18:25:47] <@%MichaelxVoorheees> @poll0_loc0 mid portal to mid portal and far portal to far portal iirc
[2022-12-08 18:25:48] <+dark__woof> But those aoe ults work so well with steels stun, dekkers ult, ect
[2022-12-08 18:25:49] <%+KnightbirdZ> Oh they changed the Prime dmh?  No more Core dmg?  thats good
[2022-12-08 18:26:00] <@%MichaelxVoorheees> @KnightbirdZ it can do core dmg but cant kill anymore
[2022-12-08 18:26:07] <Fennicks47> @dark__woof hes also a lot easier to gank if you cant use them correctly
[2022-12-08 18:26:14] <%+KnightbirdZ> Oh it does?  Oh good at least you cant kill it.
[2022-12-08 18:26:17] <+dark__woof> Tbh I just want Riktor in OP and I‚Äôll be satisfied
[2022-12-08 18:26:20] <%Un45aken> cant tell if thats lag or just a bug

[2022-12-08 18:27:35] <spudsthetuber> Just build ADC on mages, it won't make a difference on this game LUL  Fey is just an adc with great CC.
[2022-12-08 18:27:35] <Poobzee> 52-16, who can say this isn't like tdm
[2022-12-08 18:27:37] <+dark__woof> @fennicks47 I was just mentioning good combinations, there‚Äôs plenty more than just that smart a$$
[2022-12-08 18:27:40] <%THEDILLYWIGGLE> They shouldve nerfed the adc items harder tbh
[2022-12-08 18:27:48] <%hiratik> Is OP also on Epic?
[2022-12-08 18:28:21] <Leustad> I can't even login getting login process error 591, how are you playing my man ?
[2022-12-08 18:28:24] <%+kanego2113> it's so close to an ARAM already
[2022-12-08 18:28:24] <Fennicks47> @dark__woof im just saying, the designed OG paragon with those 3 ults to combo with dekker steel. the mages played bery similarly
[2022-12-08 18:28:27] <+Its_Pure_> that's literally what moba means lol
[2022-12-08 18:28:37] <@%MichaelxVoorheees> uh

[2022-12-08 18:28:51] <%johnkeiwo> kallari lookin a bit different
[2022-12-08 18:28:56] <Poobzee> @Its_Pure_ semantics sure. but there's an establish moba style
[2022-12-08 18:29:00] <%hiratik> Kallari here looks cooler
[2022-12-08 18:29:08] <Poobzee> established*
[2022-12-08 18:29:14] <!%bobisha94> @Incon lass has a pet named loki.... that explains SO much
[2022-12-08 18:29:15] <%siv0r> does Lass have a pet named Loki?
[2022-12-08 18:29:18] <%philofyore> It's good to see you having some fun today @Incon inconHype
[2022-12-08 18:29:20] <%+poll0_loc0> Incons definition of MOBA: Murdering or Bullying Arena
[2022-12-08 18:29:27] <+dark__woof> @fennicks47 I mean most games characters have similar abilities, even in smite you can compare character abilities, it‚Äôs more evident because of the small amount they had/have now
[2022-12-08 18:29:39] <+Its_Pure_> I get it, looks like they're going a different route.
[2022-12-08 18:29:46] <+NivzzNeto22> Predecessor is MOBA
[2022-12-08 18:29:46] <@%MichaelxVoorheees> !compare
[2022-12-08 18:29:47] <@%^StreamElements> Incon has described Predecessor as a traditional MOBA while Overprime plays more like an arena shooter with a hint of MOBA gameplay.

[2022-12-08 18:29:52] <Fennicks47> @dark__woof the 3 OG mages had very copy paste kits. after that, there was lot more diversity.

[2022-12-08 18:30:10] <!%bobisha94> @Incon it's the orb prime side i believe

[2022-12-08 18:30:24] <+dark__woof> @fennicks47 I mean what do you expect from early epic studios though lol
[2022-12-08 18:30:37] <Oakkwood> is pred different from this?
[2022-12-08 18:30:49] <BaconMageLv0> at least with pred, there are colored buffs to tell the difference
[2022-12-08 18:30:49] <@%MichaelxVoorheees> !diff
[2022-12-08 18:30:49] <@%^StreamElements> different mechanics for game, some heros have different abilities, pred heros have passives, diff ui and store items, map, buffs, overprime has a sprint. etc etc !compare

[2022-12-08 18:31:00] <Fennicks47> @dark__woof oh sure, im saying, overprime copied that 'copy paste' design, while i liek how pred redefined them somewhat.
[2022-12-08 18:31:23] <Oakkwood> which is better?
[2022-12-08 18:31:24] <%+bossfrisone> Overprime is going for more of an OG Paragon feel.
[2022-12-08 18:31:26] <%Un45aken> Remeber, Q adds backstab damage and you can run around the minions
[2022-12-08 18:31:29] <%+bossfrisone> Pred trying to evolve into something different.
[2022-12-08 18:31:47] <Poobzee> @Oakkwood depends on preference
[2022-12-08 18:31:53] <%+TruePlewd> also, the main strategy against Sev is to starve him. Sev would expect to be camped
[2022-12-08 18:31:57] <%Un45aken> Think you got that backwords bossfrisone
[2022-12-08 18:31:59] <culturalisms2> @bossfrisone its opposite tbh , pred is more paragon like
[2022-12-08 18:31:59] <%VelvetJumpsuit> I feel like it ould easier to stack with Seph in this game
[2022-12-08 18:32:00] <+dark__woof> @fennicks47 I feel that, I think it came down to release cause Pred lacks so much content/characters. OP probably pushed that copy/paste to get more out of the recourses they had and get more out for players
[2022-12-08 18:32:15] <+dark__woof> @fennicks47 doesn‚Äôt mean they won‚Äôt change kits over time too
[2022-12-08 18:32:19] <%+KnightbirdZ> Its like asking do you like LoL of Dota more. Or CoD or BF more.  These games are different enough that its about preference.  You can even play both
[2022-12-08 18:32:35] <Fennicks47> @dark__woof agreeed. time will tell. i mean, i dont see them reworking howie an time soon tbh.
[2022-12-08 18:32:35] <%+bossfrisone> @Un45aken @culturalisms2 then why all of the Paragon OGs and comp players saying Overprime for the win?
[2022-12-08 18:32:49] <%+KnightbirdZ> @dark__woof Good thing Pred isn't released yet.  On full Release when its free they will have everything OP does
[2022-12-08 18:32:49] <+Tagord96> @KnightbirdZ how are they dif tho? they even have some of the same heros O_O
[2022-12-08 18:32:57] <Fennicks47> @bossfrisone quotes from those lol
[2022-12-08 18:33:08] <%Un45aken> It's probably ther preference, I used to play Paragon and Pred felt more like it to me
[2022-12-08 18:33:10] <%+KnightbirdZ> @Tagord96 How the game plays, abilities, objectives, ITEMS, good lord.. so much.
[2022-12-08 18:33:16] <%+bossfrisone> @Fennicks47 At least the Smite GMs and comp players.
[2022-12-08 18:33:20] <Poobzee> @bossfrisone prob because OP is more action heavy, better for viewrships
[2022-12-08 18:33:23] <dkkiiii> you can also sprint on this game? thats look like soldier76 on ow
[2022-12-08 18:33:26] <BaconMageLv0> @Tagord96 different maps, the same characters have different playstyles between games, etc
[2022-12-08 18:33:26] <Anonghostxx> yup thee E is somethinh
[2022-12-08 18:33:29] <+dark__woof> @knightbirdz I sure hope so! I heard they said they‚Äôd release a character every month?
[2022-12-08 18:33:31] <%+bossfrisone> And then Discord pages for both, Twitch chats.  I don't have exact quotes or anything.

[2022-12-08 18:34:14] <+dark__woof> @fennicks47 nah there‚Äôs other things that‚Äôll take priority but fingers crossed they do some reworks
[2022-12-08 18:34:20] <%Un45aken> I always stack Q for the backstab damage
[2022-12-08 18:34:21] <%+Redalict> Morning all. how we digging op?
[2022-12-08 18:34:22] <%+KnightbirdZ> @dark__woof Yup, they have plans for a new hero every month that you get part of the bundle, so you get 25 Characters at Purchase in EA.  They also will add Ranked, Store etc.  Just those come later.  They plan on showing a roadmap soon.
[2022-12-08 18:34:30] <%+bossfrisone> I think the general feedback is Overprime has more outplay with the sprint, stealth, and portals.
[2022-12-08 18:34:56] <Fennicks47> @Poobzee i just do not get this take that OP is more action heavy.
[2022-12-08 18:35:08] <@%MichaelxVoorheees> @bossfrisone werent you green inconSquint
[2022-12-08 18:35:08] <%+TruePlewd> so counter to this character is _hold w key" ..... *shivers from DBD flashback*
[2022-12-08 18:35:11] <Poobzee> @Fennicks47 have you seen Pred
[2022-12-08 18:35:12] <dkkiiii> sprint on a moba or what ot is sound weird
[2022-12-08 18:35:14] <%+KnightbirdZ> @Fennicks47 How, the last game went 52 aND 16 BRO..
[2022-12-08 18:35:23] <+dark__woof> @knightbirdz ah I see, it‚Äôll probably end up more popular than OP, I only play OP cause content and the games seem faster. I do enjoy the feel of pred more though
[2022-12-08 18:35:25] <Fennicks47> @bossfrisone the sprint is one of the least skill-ceiling mechanics they added. it takes skill away actively
[2022-12-08 18:35:35] <Fennicks47> @KnightbirdZ every pred game i play has 2 kills per minute.
[2022-12-08 18:35:55] <!%bobisha94> 8
[2022-12-08 18:36:00] <dkkiiii> where the t2 tower?
[2022-12-08 18:36:00] <%+KnightbirdZ> @dark__woof I also think the audiences may differ eventually.  Give both games 6 months and we can revisit things
[2022-12-08 18:36:10] <@%MichaelxVoorheees> there is no t2 in op
[2022-12-08 18:36:20] <Poobzee> @Fennicks47 sprint, portals, 1 tower, you can dmg structures with prime, wide open jungle. it begs for action
[2022-12-08 18:36:38] <+Haygzy> Which one do you prefer @Incon thus far?
[2022-12-08 18:36:44] <@%MichaelxVoorheees> !pref
[2022-12-08 18:36:44] <@%^StreamElements> Incon has no preference to Pred vs Overprime
[2022-12-08 18:36:49] <!%bobisha94> !pref
[2022-12-08 18:36:49] <@%^StreamElements> Incon has no preference to Pred vs Overprime
[2022-12-08 18:36:57] <+Haygzy> lol
[2022-12-08 18:36:58] <Fennicks47> @Poobzee yeah i think its a lot the 1 tower so laning phase ends faster. thta said, im seeing the same kill counts in this game and pred.
[2022-12-08 18:36:58] <+Haygzy> got it
[2022-12-08 18:37:00] <+dark__woof> @knightbirdz yeah for sure
[2022-12-08 18:37:00] <%+KnightbirdZ> @Fennicks47 Max kills Ive seen in a Pred game was a 34v34 we were super close.  So yes, you get kills of course you do.  But that was at the 35 minute mark.  I dunno man.
[2022-12-08 18:37:13] <%+TruePlewd> @fennicks47 that'll change as more games get played. everyone is the same mmr, such have no match meeting making essentially. games are going to be snow bally stomps with huge total kills until mmr works itself out.
[2022-12-08 18:37:26] <%+KnightbirdZ> ^^
[2022-12-08 18:37:44] <Fennicks47> @TruePlewd which game we talking about here :P
[2022-12-08 18:38:02] <Poobzee> @Fennicks47 i def don't see 40+ kills in pred.
[2022-12-08 18:38:07] <%+TruePlewd> from design, once mmr is worked out, OP should have far higher kill counts then Pred
[2022-12-08 18:38:40] <Fennicks47> @Poobzee so, its more even? what do you mean. they just said they had a 34v34 game, and like i said, every game i play has 2 kills per minute across teams
[2022-12-08 18:38:42] <+LucHighwalker> @Poobzee 40+ kills in pred are definitely a thing
[2022-12-08 18:38:42] <BaconMageLv0> Personal experience from the Pred game's I've played: People dying often here is part of the course, people dying in Pred often means at least one person doing something wrong

[2022-12-08 18:39:04] <%Un45aken> I feel like Pred can be just as bad... it's slower but you see it happening early lol
[2022-12-08 18:39:09] <gamebit1> Do they plan to bring both to console?
[2022-12-08 18:39:20] <%+TruePlewd> yes
[2022-12-08 18:39:23] <%Un45aken> Both have plans for console @gamebit1
[2022-12-08 18:39:28] <%Un45aken> not much detail outside of that

[2022-12-08 18:39:32] <!%bobisha94> @Incon I have had games where we countered snowball by having the better jungler and secuing the orb prime.
[2022-12-08 18:39:36] <%+KnightbirdZ> Snowballing is a balance issue so both games can fix that
[2022-12-08 18:39:37] <%HerculesMWP> All mobas snowball, there‚Äôs no fix
[2022-12-08 18:39:57] <%+KnightbirdZ> well try to fix it, heh :D
[2022-12-08 18:39:59] <Fennicks47> @KnightbirdZ 1 tower and travel mode def contributes a ton
[2022-12-08 18:39:59] <%andrewg117> @Incon seems like OP and Pred need a few months in the lab before they play better
[2022-12-08 18:40:04] <@%MichaelxVoorheees> @TruePlewd its behind you inconScared
[2022-12-08 18:40:06] <%Un45aken> @bobisha94 what are you trying to say lol
[2022-12-08 18:40:17] <Poobzee> @Fennicks47 what i'm saying is in OP you have to worry about team fights/ganks from the get go and onward. in pred its a bit more strategic
[2022-12-08 18:40:32] <%philofyore> Is today pure OP or Pred too for direct comparison?
[2022-12-08 18:40:36] <+dark__woof> I can‚Äôt wait until they add reporting and punishment for griefing in Pred, it‚Äôs a pretty big issue currently
[2022-12-08 18:40:36] <Fennicks47> @Poobzee current meta is to gank at level 1 with jungle in pred. ?
[2022-12-08 18:40:43] <@%MichaelxVoorheees> @Incon in the words of edna from incredibles.... NO CAPE! inconRee
[2022-12-08 18:40:55] <%+KnightbirdZ> @andrewg117 Yes definitely.  Spring mode is crazy, super fun yes, but it allows for so many kills cause you can get to every fight, especially if you use a portal.  In Pred if you are Offlane you wont make it to the fight in Duo. So your job is to push the towers and take them.
[2022-12-08 18:41:03] <!%bobisha94> @Un45aken that this game there is more potential to win when there is snowball than the other games in this atmosphere right now
[2022-12-08 18:41:04] <%+TruePlewd> snowball is actually important to MOBAs so games can end in a satisfying way. the issue is making sure that snowball isn't too fast and that there are comeback mechanics that work, but aren't too strong
[2022-12-08 18:41:17] <+LucHighwalker> @poobzee what are you talking about? pred has a level 1 gank meta atm
[2022-12-08 18:41:22] <%Un45aken> she is more Loki in this game
[2022-12-08 18:41:25] <Poobzee> @Fennicks47 you're safe to leave lane in OP at any point if minions aren't on tower
[2022-12-08 18:41:26] <!%bobisha94> @Incon well since kallari is basically loki that makes sense Kappa
[2022-12-08 18:41:32] <%that_one_ginger_boy> the e is really terrible
[2022-12-08 18:41:38] <+Kelinesh> i mean, the loki clone being bad cant be a negative LUL
[2022-12-08 18:41:39] <%that_one_ginger_boy> like for no reson
[2022-12-08 18:41:41] <%hiratik> @Incon What jungler did you like the most in Pred? Feng?
[2022-12-08 18:41:50] <%+Jagsman119> Which murdock kit do you like better?
[2022-12-08 18:41:55] <%Un45aken> @bobisha94 Yea I was jk you were talking about being a better jungler while incon is jungling
[2022-12-08 18:41:56] <%+Redalict> Balanced.
[2022-12-08 18:41:56] <@%MichaelxVoorheees> @hiratik i think so
[2022-12-08 18:42:01] <Fennicks47> @Poobzee until you run into someone in travel mode
[2022-12-08 18:42:01] <!%bobisha94> grux is a damagy boi
[2022-12-08 18:42:03] <%philofyore> @Incon We doing just OP today?
[2022-12-08 18:42:09] <%+poll0_loc0> Incon up to how many people can you queue with?
[2022-12-08 18:42:15] <@%MichaelxVoorheees> @Jagsman119 i like pred murdock more, i feel he does too? PrideShrug
[2022-12-08 18:42:24] <%andrewg117> @Incon i had a decent game on her. it looks like the snowball is rough
[2022-12-08 18:42:24] <%Un45aken> I have way more comeback wins in this game than most other mobas
[2022-12-08 18:42:28] <@%MichaelxVoorheees> @philofyore today and tomorrow was planned for OP unless he changes his mind
[2022-12-08 18:42:31] <%+Jagsman119> @michaelxvoorheees i feel the same
[2022-12-08 18:42:43] <!%bobisha94> @poll0_loc0 looks like 3 for casual and 2 for ranked unless you are in qualifying matches or masters or above
[2022-12-08 18:42:45] <%philofyore> Thanks Michael :)
[2022-12-08 18:42:45] <+Jbone20> 21 kills at 13 min is crazy
[2022-12-08 18:42:50] <@VirusBot> Don't forget to use !highlight [tag] whenever something cool happens on stream. Use it responsibly.
[2022-12-08 18:43:08] <@%MichaelxVoorheees> @Jagsman119 the mortar seems fun in a goofy way but in reality its so bad lol and in a real fight
[2022-12-08 18:43:09] <+Jbone20> Games all about fighting not objectives
[2022-12-08 18:43:12] <%+Jagsman119> Sneaking away in portals seems kind of uncompetitive
[2022-12-08 18:43:12] <+dark__woof> At least it people feed in this game you can feel like you‚Äôre doing something by reporting, in pred you just have to sit there for 30+ minutes while your teammates throw
[2022-12-08 18:43:15] <Poobzee> @Fennicks47 and then you fight the jungle is pretty visually open
[2022-12-08 18:43:22] <%andrewg117> pentawPain portal outplay
[2022-12-08 18:43:28] <%+poll0_loc0> @bobisha94 ok, thanks. I was wondering if you 4/5 queue. Would be fun to see Incon queue with RushFrog
[2022-12-08 18:43:28] <cybercena89> portal is magic
[2022-12-08 18:43:38] <%+hlp_hlp_my_leg> that portal mechanic is terrible
[2022-12-08 18:43:41] <SpikePsydrag> so.......paragon, predecesor or smite? xd
[2022-12-08 18:43:44] <%+poll0_loc0> GET OVER HERE!!!

[2022-12-08 18:43:45] <@%^StreamElements> Incon has no preference to Pred vs Overprime
[2022-12-08 18:43:45] <Fennicks47> @Poobzee they have travel mode and you dont cause u jungliong, so they always catch you and if they are ahead, they kill you because its op and you cant juke
[2022-12-08 18:43:46] <@%MichaelxVoorheees> !moba
[2022-12-08 18:43:46] <@%^StreamElements> Incon is not done playing Smite! He plans to play Smite, Predecessor, and Overprime. Just because he is playing one does not mean he doesn't like the other two <3
[2022-12-08 18:44:03] <Fennicks47> @Poobzee open*
[2022-12-08 18:44:04] <%hiratik> @SpikePsydrag Anything but Smite
[2022-12-08 18:44:04] <!%bobisha94> @Incon we were having a team fight at orb prime one time while I was playing muriel support.  I took the portal from orb to spirit then ulted back to orb so they couldn't escape through the portal.  it was chef's kiss
[2022-12-08 18:44:18] <FPG_29> if you use the E ont the target that you rmb you will root them
[2022-12-08 18:44:34] <bustabuu> Uh incon I just saw a video that overprime steals your information from StayaliveGG...
[2022-12-08 18:44:38] <%andrewg117> inconFail fighting a hunter ever
[2022-12-08 18:44:39] <+stop_wiggle_wit_it> pretty sure you healed him when you attacked him
[2022-12-08 18:44:41] <bustabuu> looked fairly legit

[2022-12-08 18:44:58] <WinnaBango> At what point does that guy start to get a loyalty check?
[2022-12-08 18:45:01] <+LucHighwalker> @hiratik thats the spirit!
[2022-12-08 18:45:20] <SpikePsydrag> some people just want to see the world burn
[2022-12-08 18:45:28] <+Tomahawk1x> I'm just here for the @Incon cursing. It is by far my favorite thing. #graphicsSult
[2022-12-08 18:45:33] <@%MichaelxVoorheees> @Incon you just did a surrender thats why lol
[2022-12-08 18:45:33] <bustabuu> nah like you agree to give this company your tax ID and bank statements
[2022-12-08 18:45:38] <%poopFATbaldOLD> 16 take it or leave it
[2022-12-08 18:45:57] <!%bobisha94> @Incon request surrender and then decline it.  it's a power play
[2022-12-08 18:46:01] <bustabuu> like seems kinda wild just wanted to ask someone who could read the fine print since I don't have a pc
[2022-12-08 18:46:10] <%+KnightbirdZ> lmao capitol d colon
[2022-12-08 18:46:26] <+dark__woof> Like there was any other option but surrendering lol
[2022-12-08 18:46:32] <%+codenameluis> this time with feeling
[2022-12-08 18:46:42] <+Tomahawk1x> @lassiz gets pooped on 6 more times in a row? typically thats extra charge
[2022-12-08 18:47:00] <+Johanmoney> Pretty sure daretocare is an OG
[2022-12-08 18:47:02] <+an_ambassador> I will have to admit, Rampage feels a lot better in this than Pred
[2022-12-08 18:47:05] <HarleyCream> @bustabuu they just copy pasted their stuff from korea
[2022-12-08 18:47:07] <%+poll0_loc0> I want headshots in Pred/OP...not super high damage just a nice ding sound (like Rogue Company) and like 1.1 damage
[2022-12-08 18:47:09] <%+KnightbirdZ> the Hero Rotation is kinda weird...
[2022-12-08 18:47:21] <@%MichaelxVoorheees> shadowrealm inconCreep
[2022-12-08 18:47:21] <!%bobisha94> Nooo, i don't see muriel in the hero rotation
[2022-12-08 18:47:36] <%+KnightbirdZ> Yeah the roles get messed up.  If they fixed that it would be better
[2022-12-08 18:47:53] <+dark__woof> Definitely blue balled us with the characters in the OP test
[2022-12-08 18:47:54] <+kriptyk60> Is countess playable or still super weak?
[2022-12-08 18:48:02] <%+poll0_loc0> Well you can bash adc heads with a sledgehammer
[2022-12-08 18:48:10] <!%bobisha94> @Incon fine, headshots can do 1x damage and all else can do 0.9 damage
[2022-12-08 18:48:26] <%+poll0_loc0> @bobisha94 Get out of my head
[2022-12-08 18:48:33] <%+Jagsman119> @poll0_loc0 just add the The Sledge into the game
[2022-12-08 18:48:53] <+Cakestackula> It would be awesome if you teamed up with sneakyindustries. He played OG Paragon back in the day
[2022-12-08 18:49:04] <%+KnightbirdZ> 30% discount, still a chunk of change..
[2022-12-08 18:49:06] <cybercena89> will make 4 weeks or 40 box Kappa
[2022-12-08 18:49:16] <%+Redalict> after the first 5 days of free heroes it sl cost $70 usd to get into ranked
[2022-12-08 18:49:18] <Vitautass> new webcam?
[2022-12-08 18:49:20] <!%bobisha94> @Incon at least that will keep people from getting into ranked too terribly early before they have learned the game.
[2022-12-08 18:49:24] <%+bigo26shen> @incon buy any champs with in game currency yet?
[2022-12-08 18:49:27] <BaconMageLv0> that... was a confidence
[2022-12-08 18:49:33] <+LucHighwalker> @poll0_loc0 might be hard to balance since variety of head sizes. Also, grim. Would the head shot be the robots head or the little flying guy? or Iggy, which head does extra damage? either choice is like half the model.
[2022-12-08 18:49:35] <%+poll0_loc0> Incon said "THERE CAN ONLY BE ONE MIDLANER!"
[2022-12-08 18:49:37] <@%$air2jodran3> @Vitautass yes

[2022-12-08 18:50:58] <BaconMageLv0> @camboogie20 she's a mage and Rev has high attack speed as a passive
[2022-12-08 18:51:15] <dognus88> i use to love the full crit power build on rev. you hold that 4th shot for its dmg multiplyer and hope you can 1shot.
[2022-12-08 18:51:49] <@%MichaelxVoorheees> i feel bad..

[2022-12-08 18:53:25] <Wook1n> @Incon Ty for the content today man, always a good time.
[2022-12-08 18:53:26] <BaconMageLv0> she's in a pretty lose lose situation rn, either she runs away and opens herself up to a full Storm Of Bullets or she stays and gets wrecked by autos.
[2022-12-08 18:53:27] <+Conjirus> @MichaelxVoorheees i bet you a mage would stand a better shot
[2022-12-08 18:53:34] <@%$air2jodran3> @farenbudz it's a separate install than the last beta

[2022-12-08 18:53:51] <@%MichaelxVoorheees> @Conjirus what part of she is literally a mage in op is not computing
[2022-12-08 18:53:53] <%+Jagsman119> @conjirus phase kit was reworked to actually be a mage in this game. She is not a support anymore
[2022-12-08 18:53:55] <%+codenameluis> do towers still target you when you ult someone?

[2022-12-08 18:56:17] <%ZeroRebellion> the unfort part is phase could easily punish there a bit, but might be too new to know how
[2022-12-08 18:56:18] <BaconMageLv0> @heyJESS3 TLDR: the answer to when is "yes"

[2022-12-08 18:58:52] <+mastertheiff> is this game out now and is it available on console?

[2022-12-08 18:59:06] <BaconMageLv0> @mastertheiff early access, and no, but planned

[2022-12-08 18:59:42] <+mastertheiff> ok ty
[2022-12-08 18:59:56] <%+jsrc1115> Noooooooooooooooo
[2022-12-08 18:59:57] <+DanklesD> I do think that if pred will probably overtake this game if the servers stay solid and especially when they release ranked
[2022-12-08 18:59:58] <+1violentpacifist> this games okay its just laggy
[2022-12-08 19:00:13] <%+bossfrisone> No!  Smite sucks.
[2022-12-08 19:00:16] <@%MichaelxVoorheees> inconOuch
[2022-12-08 19:00:16] <%$GrumpeITiltSkin> not yet, i think. I feel like they will definitely win out over time

[2022-12-08 19:00:21] <+popoto_mage> @DanklesD yeah, Im curious to see how things go once predecessor goes full release F2P
[2022-12-08 19:00:23] <%TheseGoodGames> do you think they will create pro leagues and teams?
[2022-12-08 19:00:38] <%+bigo26shen> @incon pred better moba overprime better battler is only real diff
[2022-12-08 19:00:39] <@%$air2jodran3> Maybe when either game fully launches with console, until then probably a no-go
[2022-12-08 19:00:40] <+kkingblm> that's unfortunate
[2022-12-08 19:00:54] <%$GrumpeITiltSkin> like once either one of them get on console I think a lot more people will watch it
[2022-12-08 19:01:08] <%+bossfrisone> With all due respect, @Incon, you seem much more happy not playing Smite.  Might be worth considering.
[2022-12-08 19:01:17] <%TheseGoodGames> sorry, do you think they will create A pro league and pro teams for either game?
[2022-12-08 19:01:18] <%$GrumpeITiltSkin> was the old paragon scene considered big on twitch?
[2022-12-08 19:01:25] <lord_vx> @TheseGoodGames : Pred will have a competitive scenes. They already stated that in their last Q&A
[2022-12-08 19:01:33] <dognus88> i liked how feng dashed to you then ran away immediately
[2022-12-08 19:01:34] <%+Bundles6> is adc basic range further in this then pred
[2022-12-08 19:01:36] <%+bigo26shen> @bossfrisone he needs to pay the bills
[2022-12-08 19:01:36] <%+bossfrisone> @GrumpeITiltSkin Mmmm I think OG Paragon was before Twitch blew up.
[2022-12-08 19:01:56] <%Un45aken> Think there is like 1 less crit item if anything
[2022-12-08 19:02:04] <+DanklesD> I think releasing in Alpha hurts a lot of games these days. Mostly because the hype for the games dies down before the game is fully fleshed out. Timed betas seem to work better
[2022-12-08 19:02:08] <+an_ambassador> I mean in comparison, you get 175% crit damage by default in this
[2022-12-08 19:02:15] <%+bossfrisone> @bigo26shen Yeah, I can't speak to that part.
[2022-12-08 19:02:17] <+LucHighwalker> @grumpeitiltskin paragon, towards the end of life, was about as popular as smite. It just didn't have the ridiculous return of investment that fortnite had.
[2022-12-08 19:02:28] <%+colonmedic> this the game that's gonna replace smite
[2022-12-08 19:02:39] <@%MichaelxVoorheees> sure
[2022-12-08 19:02:39] <5tokman> there was only 1 paragon tournament before fortnite things

[2022-12-08 19:25:11] <%philofyore> Its also weird that people dont seem to want to make their own decision about it but rather ask streamers which they should play

[2022-12-08 19:25:13] <@%^StreamElements> Incon has described Predecessor as a traditional MOBA while Overprime plays more like an arena shooter with a hint of MOBA gameplay.

[2022-12-08 19:25:47] <@%$air2jodran3> @philofyore tbf to that, Pred is not f2p. Asking a streamer for an opinion is 100% valid
[2022-12-08 19:25:54] <+DoomCMYK_> Only things I like are valid
[2022-12-08 19:25:55] <12o13> Is predecessor the game where incon was a robot a few days ago?
[2022-12-08 19:25:58] <+beelzebossz> so far, if you had to pick, do you prefer Predecessor or Overprime?
[2022-12-08 19:26:03] <@%$air2jodran3> !pref
[2022-12-08 19:26:04] <@%^StreamElements> Incon has no preference to Pred vs Overprime

[2022-12-08 20:16:24] <+DoomCMYK_> Pred is good but this looks action packed

[2022-12-08 20:16:55] <+belakizdank> over prime feels more arcade like, with pred being more strategy focused
[2022-12-08 20:16:55] <%andrewg117> @Incon yeah, Pred feels smooth but the gameplay is a little boring

[2022-12-08 20:36:36] <BaconMageLv0> Somewhat related, it kind of bugs me when people immediately jump to "X is bad" because they don't like it.

[2022-12-08 20:37:27] <@%MichaelxVoorheees> its funny cuz most of us like pred more
[2022-12-08 20:37:29] <GrayRagnarok> did they get rid of his mortar shots?
[2022-12-08 20:37:31] <%+Andy1134> he killed you before you could look at what he was carrying last time

[2022-12-08 20:38:19] <%andrewg117> I just want something better than smite pentawPain
[2022-12-08 20:38:25] <%+TruePlewd> I think my preference for Pred is also linked to bring a Fortnite player. if I want an arena shooter feel I'll play that. I'm looking for a MOBA replacement
[2022-12-08 20:38:35] <@%MichaelxVoorheees> @GrayRagnarok if he hadnt demanded incon to change game we woulda mostly agreed with him LuL

[2022-12-08 20:39:01] <GrayRagnarok> murdocks Q seems very powerful
[2022-12-08 20:39:01] <%hiratik> Does Op also have the killable minion highlight mechanic as Pred? The last-hitting seems sorta easier here
[2022-12-08 20:39:06] <%+meiisgoddess> I'm the main character of the world so my opinion is right everyone else is wrong
[2022-12-08 20:39:07] <%+Andy1134> those mortars are nasty
[2022-12-08 20:39:18] <@%MichaelxVoorheees> @hiratik its an execute at a point of hp while pred is red when the auto will kill i think
[2022-12-08 20:39:21] <%oiskeyp0iskey> its ok guys, some of us just want the streamer to change the channel Kappa
[2022-12-08 20:39:38] <GrayRagnarok> incon got casting couched

[2022-12-08 20:40:58] <baker0209> Does murdock and rev have the same ability now? Murdocks rocket move seems like a reskin

[2022-12-08 20:41:16] <+WipeoutSG> is this free early access?
[2022-12-08 20:41:20] <!%bobisha94> @Incon I could agree with that, but I think it has to do with how rangers are so powerful right now and should change with balance
[2022-12-08 20:41:37] <@%$air2jodran3> @WipeoutSG yes
[2022-12-08 20:41:42] <+DoomCMYK_> Free Early Access yes

[2022-12-08 20:43:28] <+adxdope> I feel overprime is too low paced
[2022-12-08 20:44:05] <+Flowswitch> Nah its just a fast pace brawler lol
[2022-12-08 20:44:19] <%Danger_Corpse> But it's tough to play Smite when the four other people on your team are just wandering around the map doing nothing at all and you're down 7k and over 20 kills but they WILL NOT F6.

[2022-12-08 20:44:44] <+kushmonk420> This fast paced craziness is why I chose predecessor haha
[2022-12-08 20:45:59] <baker0209> Are there wards in this game?
[2022-12-08 20:46:03] <@%MichaelxVoorheees> the teleport mechanic just seems like an accelerant for snowball
[2022-12-08 20:46:08] <BaconMageLv0> yeah
[2022-12-08 20:46:21] <@%MichaelxVoorheees> you can have 1 ward. or support can have a few @baker0209
[2022-12-08 20:46:22] <+WipeoutSG> is it atleast a smoother experience than the final test?
[2022-12-08 20:46:29] <%+Calvinman4> :)
[2022-12-08 20:46:35] <%+Calvinman4> hey friends I luv u
[2022-12-08 20:46:42] <+BlankeysLab> You can only TP through the portals 3 times. You can lock the portal and watch the timer.
[2022-12-08 20:46:51] <%+TruePlewd> I like OP's feel, but I already play a fast paced third person shooter so I'll likely end up on Pred
[2022-12-08 20:46:53] <+BlankeysLab> Unless that was changed recently
[2022-12-08 20:46:57] <!%bobisha94> @Incon I think the portal when activated should remain open for like 5 seconds and then go onCD
[2022-12-08 20:46:57] <baker0209> @MichaelxVoorheees Ok so nobody is using them this game
[2022-12-08 20:47:12] <%+TruePlewd> because I don't currently have a MOBA
[2022-12-08 20:47:15] <@%MichaelxVoorheees> @MichaelxVoorheees theres a lot of area to ward and you only have like 1 each except support
[2022-12-08 20:47:45] <Mystic_Night94> arent the ward areas small too?
[2022-12-08 20:47:46] <@%MichaelxVoorheees> im sad that lassiz says fore and not yeet
[2022-12-08 20:47:58] <!%bobisha94> @MichaelxVoorheees that's one of the things i love about pred and op is that supports get 3 wards but in pred the wards are so teensy tiny
[2022-12-08 20:48:02] <%Danger_Corpse> @TruePlewd Have you heard of this game called Smite?
[2022-12-08 20:48:05] <@%MichaelxVoorheees> @Mystic_Night94 it feels like that. like i dont think it covers the whole paths
[2022-12-08 20:48:06] <+Flowswitch> Its almost like there are no lane phases. You can literally abandon offlane and just gank. Predecessor is the better moba imo
[2022-12-08 20:48:12] <%+acraine1> Watch out that plant explodes

[2022-12-08 20:49:20] <!%bobisha94> @Incon the antici...pation of waiting to see which team got the objective LUL
[2022-12-08 20:49:24] <%Danger_Corpse> @TruePlewd ...no, you're thinking of...uh...Pokemon. Yeah, Pokemon. Smite is cool.
[2022-12-08 20:49:36] <Mystic_Night94> wait a sec, anyone remember Battleborn? didnt people describe that like a brawler with a moba style? (never played it myself)
[2022-12-08 20:49:54] <%dookyhead24> battleborn had potential
[2022-12-08 20:49:58] <+ScholarMo> lowkey feel like people gotta double down the predecessor is better because they spent the money already KEKW
[2022-12-08 20:50:06] <!%bobisha94> @Incon and that's why the people who play them are so toxic... just years of steeping in frustration

[2022-12-08 20:50:21] <%$GrumpeITiltSkin> @Incon what are the cons of both?
[2022-12-08 20:50:26] <NepNip> I hear that you actually have to pay for the hero's or spend 18 weeks unlocking them with ingame currency. That true?

[2022-12-08 20:50:56] <@%MichaelxVoorheees> @Danger_Corpse and i had a couple good games and regretted it as soon as we left joust and had randoms lol
[2022-12-08 20:51:03] <BaconMageLv0> I personally prefer Predecessor because I can actually play it unlike OP
[2022-12-08 20:51:07] <%$GrumpeITiltSkin> @bobisha94 well played
[2022-12-08 20:51:13] <cybercena89> double fun
[2022-12-08 20:51:39] <%+TruePlewd> @scholarmo spending $10 isn't right to create a sunk cost fallacy for me. I like both, but Pred feels more like a MOBA to me
[2022-12-08 20:51:57] <%+TruePlewd> isn't enough*
[2022-12-08 20:52:08] <@%$air2jodran3> @NepNip they are reducing the cost and playtime to unlock, but the concept is correct
[2022-12-08 20:52:20] <NepNip> I was hoping to play both OP and Pred, but for the cost and timegating in OP ill stick to Predecessor it seems. I like the pacing in Pred more anyway
[2022-12-08 20:52:20] <@%MichaelxVoorheees> @ScholarMo its unfortunate you think that way

[2022-12-08 20:53:17] <NepNip> Pred is $10 but you will get 25+ heros for the cost
[2022-12-08 20:53:19] <!%bobisha94> @Incon it's just piles of heavily breaded seafood
[2022-12-08 20:53:20] <%+TruePlewd> country seafood buffet better have cat fish or it's plain cursed
[2022-12-08 20:53:21] <%+KnightbirdZ> @oksilkyy no Pred is $10 and OP is free to play but you need to buy Heroes
[2022-12-08 20:53:22] <Mystic_Night94> either OP or pred puts out a god pack, prolly gonna get it, prolly the no 1 reason i played smite so much
[2022-12-08 20:53:22] <%poopFATbaldOLD> @oksilkyy the opposite

[2022-12-08 20:54:07] <@%^StreamElements> HELLO CHAT! Predecessor is currently in Early Access! This means you will have to buy one of the bundles to play it! Minimum is $10! The game WILL be free to play on release! Enjoy!
[2022-12-08 20:54:22] <@%MichaelxVoorheees> it will be at min $20 around the 14th which sucks
[2022-12-08 20:54:29] <Mystic_Night94> @Mystic_Night94 yeah, def getting that, just want to know future plans for similar packs
[2022-12-08 20:54:32] <!%bobisha94> @Incon I love how orb prime can let you win games like this where the enemy team is fed
[2022-12-08 20:54:37] <+oksilkyy> For all you pred players out there are u guys enjoying it?
[2022-12-08 20:54:41] <NepNip> Also in OP you need at least 14 heros to play Ranked. So you do the math on that cost or time to even play. So lame, I was looking forward to it too after the EA
[2022-12-08 20:54:41] <@%MichaelxVoorheees> i think if they were gonna make it cost (which i dont agree but i understand) it should stay at $10
[2022-12-08 20:54:49] <BaconMageLv0> yeah, it's pretty fun
[2022-12-08 20:54:54] <%+KnightbirdZ> @oksilkyy yes, althought MMR needs work.  :D
[2022-12-08 20:55:06] <@%MichaelxVoorheees> @oksilkyy i think it feels much better. unless you want a battle moba thing like overwatch lol
[2022-12-08 20:55:10] <BaconMageLv0> some problems, but nothing Pred specific
[2022-12-08 20:55:12] <+jg_duino> @oksilkyy very much so. it feels like the og Paragon
[2022-12-08 20:55:15] <diin126> i would love to get pred but i dont have the money available to spend it in game , so i will have to endure with OP in the meantime, also hi :u
[2022-12-08 20:55:24] <%+TruePlewd> and because of the reputations of the two dev teams/companies I feel like Pred will be in a better place than OP in a year, but I could be surprised easily
[2022-12-08 20:55:25] <+oksilkyy> @knightbirdz mmr is on crack or what?
[2022-12-08 20:55:30] <+DoomCMYK_> More like InAimlabs amirite

[2022-12-08 20:55:49] <+jg_duino> COVID still > No COVID? they must have nerfed the COVID buffs
[2022-12-08 20:55:59] <NepNip> Predecessor is better paced I think. Matches are only 25-40 min average and you hit max build much sooner than OP
[2022-12-08 20:56:04] <+oksilkyy> @michaelxvoorheees any initial changes you would make?
[2022-12-08 20:56:06] <diin126> @MichaelxVoorheees @MichaelxVoorheees  inconHappy
[2022-12-08 20:56:07] <%+KnightbirdZ> @oksilkyy na not too bad, just needs to be tuned. Right now it is placing you but you still get some mixed games

[2022-12-08 20:56:22] <+jg_duino> hey I fought that deer in elden ring
[2022-12-08 20:56:53] <%dookyhead24> hmmm ive been messing with overprime and i like it but if pred is slower pace and feels better i might make the switch
[2022-12-08 20:56:59] <@%MichaelxVoorheees> @oksilkyy i havent gotten around to playing it too much sadly lol i have no intent of soloing mobas anymore inconDerp so been just doing single players games or dbd. others might have an answer
[2022-12-08 20:57:03] <+oksilkyy> @knightbirdz oh okay that‚Äôs good then. As long as it‚Äôs not crazy bad like shooter games we should be chillin

[2022-12-08 20:57:55] <NepNip> Pred is better optimized because they actually took the time to upgrade to UE5 prior to launch unlike OP
[2022-12-08 20:57:58] <diin126> optimization makes everyone horny Kreygasm
[2022-12-08 20:58:10] <+DoomCMYK_> We need more eSports callouts

[2022-12-08 20:58:25] <%Danger_Corpse> I don't know about the game, but this match is buck wild.
[2022-12-08 20:58:36] <@%MichaelxVoorheees> @NepNip i dont think the engine is the issue, its more like overprimes coding isnt holding up as well. like pred put a lot of focus on their code
[2022-12-08 20:58:36] <+jg_duino> @oksilkyy the pace of play on Pred feels very true to the og. there are honestly some things that I believe Pred does better than the og
[2022-12-08 20:58:50] <+jg_duino> ^^
[2022-12-08 20:58:53] <@%MichaelxVoorheees> i dont think EU 4 - 5 diff is that big atm

[2022-12-08 21:00:02] <%+TruePlewd> @oksilkyy OP NEEDS better optimization and the balance feels a little wonky. I'd also like to see them let their characters be ugly because I'm horrified at the idea of uwu'd Rikter. Pred needs to get ranked and maintain their better balance while quickly adding content.
[2022-12-08 21:00:15] <@%MichaelxVoorheees> its what some ppl might turn their noses up that americans do? that mentality ? @Incon

[2022-12-08 21:00:55] <+jg_duino> it kind of rubbed me the wrong way that they took the name Paragon instead of just sticking with Overprime

[2022-12-08 21:01:04] <Mystic_Night94> its definitely an interesting thing to consider, omeda who makes pred doesnt have any reputation yet, but netmarble has previous projects to look at

[2022-12-08 21:02:07] <+oksilkyy> @trueplewd gotchu bro! As long as pred releases ranked within the first month of release along with up-keeping their game I think it‚Äôll work out
[2022-12-08 21:02:10] <%+TruePlewd> @claybourne no, but the possibility exists and the thought haunts my nightmares
[2022-12-08 21:02:12] <!%bobisha94> @Incon oh did they take the player damage away from the orb prime?
[2022-12-08 21:02:16] <12o13> can you headshot minions in this game?

[2022-12-08 21:02:22] <+WhatDothLife> Surely three new versions of Paragon will succeed while the OG didn't?
[2022-12-08 21:02:26] <@%MichaelxVoorheees> @12o13 yes but there is no headshot dmg
