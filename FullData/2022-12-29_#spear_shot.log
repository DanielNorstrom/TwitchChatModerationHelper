[2022-12-29 17:30:59] <%+3i1_> 350 for an hour when he is hard stuck plat KEKW
[2022-12-29 17:31:02] <Snaxo1> to be honest the only valid critisicm is actually just bad advice, but the price issues arent rly a problem considering people buy it
[2022-12-29 17:31:02] <%GrimWillOnTwitchTV> Value your money more
[2022-12-29 17:31:02] <mrconstantine1> mfcker scam people for money fck him
[2022-12-29 17:31:06] <ltmanu99> He's a Snake Oil salesman
[2022-12-29 17:31:06] <donartfv2> hes selling bad lemons but hes saying that they are good
[2022-12-29 17:31:09] <donartfv2> its misadvertising
[2022-12-29 17:31:10] <%+Khaalaan> green lemon > classic lemon
[2022-12-29 17:31:12] <%silversurfer092> A lot of people wanted his coaching, so he jacked up prices. People kept buying his coaching. I don't see how he's in the wrong here. He put a price on his service and people bought it
[2022-12-29 17:31:13] <%+hyunwonji> the problem is he's writing essays and harssing everyone saying they are bad lemons @Spear_Shot
[2022-12-29 17:31:20] <%+Logicals_> yes hes selling bad lemons but his whole fake challanger thing was wrong for him to do no?

[2022-12-29 17:31:30] <%silversurfer092> I think just lying about his ELO is bad though. Just false advertising
[2022-12-29 17:31:30] <hubisxd_> good take
[2022-12-29 17:31:40] <%+yaser1s> he lied about being challenger, he only said the lemons was bad when he got caught
[2022-12-29 17:31:41] <@%$WeepingTiger> i think ppl r mad coz he got exposed for never hitting chall so its false advertising
[2022-12-29 17:31:43] <%Atroxos16> I think it's justified but his customers are dumb af too, everyone is to blame here while he's winning in the end
[2022-12-29 17:31:44] <invisibru_jk2> u guys taking this too serious. it's just funny how he's coping

[2022-12-29 19:10:59] <Arhil120> champ is broken or the kassadin just doesnt exist and you killed a minion?
[2022-12-29 19:11:00] <TakeshiSoda> the item has two passives, they're independent
[2022-12-29 19:11:10] <Necr0mancerish> CHAT THE DAMAGE AMP SCALES OFF YOUR CRIT

[2022-12-29 19:11:19] <JacePT_> if u have at least 60% crit ur attacks reduce ur cooldowns
[2022-12-29 19:11:21] <%AcesPrune> the different passive work independently, i think
[2022-12-29 19:11:23] <%+SLIP_Farengear> @Spear_Shot So maybe you build the letha mythic in 4th item ? cuz the problem with kraken is that all of the as you get is not very interesting since you wanna spam spells

[2022-12-29 19:54:18] <tony_harhko> maybe we swap mortal for collector? dirk + pickaxe that might be good for early (kinda mirrors your normal early build for bork rush)
[2022-12-29 19:54:18] <%GrimWillOnTwitchTV> Except Exodia decks are designed to draw all 5 first turn so its much better than this fucking build Nerdge
[2022-12-29 19:54:19] <+KleuTSchi> So go other builds and at 6 items sell everything to buy these 5, noted.
