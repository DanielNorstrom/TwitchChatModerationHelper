[2022-12-24 06:29:18] <galedss> do you mind explaining what snapping does?
[2022-12-24 06:29:50] <+maverick2056> When you snap it doubles the amount of cubes to play for up to 8 max
[2022-12-24 06:30:30] <galedss> ah so it's basically an I'm confident I can win button so I'll raise the odds?
[2022-12-24 06:30:47] <+maverick2056> yes basically

[2022-12-24 06:32:59] <SirArTHICC> the left one I think doesn't flood until the turn after the other one
[2022-12-24 06:33:15] VIEWERS: 164
[2022-12-24 06:33:50] <Wwwwwildhero> you win now with vision

[2022-12-24 06:36:14] <perping> also, no one in your cl range is gonna have magneto
[2022-12-24 06:36:20] <Wwwwwildhero> the area where magneto is played, doc ock pulls cards from hand

[2022-12-24 10:39:04] <+pickle_bolas> why has wild never taken off how modern has in magic? you would think the concept of getting to play with cards you own would be a universal thing.

[2022-12-24 10:40:12] <Xenth1s> think there was 1 or 2 tournaments
[2022-12-24 10:40:17] VIEWERS: 391
[2022-12-24 10:40:27] <Xenth1s> but its the same as wizards, standard sell newest product
[2022-12-24 10:40:41] <$Yelxor_Cruz> does plaguespreader hit plaguespreader again?
[2022-12-24 10:40:49] <Xenth1s> it can hit same minion yes
[2022-12-24 10:40:51] <+0ddler_> pickle i think its because you dont own the cards, so the incentive is to dust cards when they rotate so you can continue to play standard
[2022-12-24 10:40:58] <+pickle_bolas> @xenth1s modern is more popular than standard and has its own statight to modern sets now.
[2022-12-24 10:41:05] <tm_war> also a but of combo deck have ways to tutor stuff out too
[2022-12-24 10:41:06] <+0ddler_> that said i dont dust my cards
[2022-12-24 10:41:24] <+pickle_bolas> they should have split the events half wild half standard
[2022-12-24 10:41:35] <Xenth1s> but its player driven, i still think hasbro tries to incentivize to buy newest packs/foils

[2022-12-24 10:42:19] <+pickle_bolas> @xenth1s they sell standard packs to pioneers and commander players mainly now. they pack standard full of commander staples
[2022-12-24 10:43:13] <Xenth1s> do they include reprints tho, i still see most good EDH decks going for several thousands
[2022-12-24 10:43:36] <Xenth1s> but it may also be because of paper tcg, not digital ccg
[2022-12-24 10:44:17] VIEWERS: 412
[2022-12-24 10:44:34] <+pickle_bolas> the expensive edh decks have reserved list cards or cards which are only reprinted at mythic. they do reprint when modern staples are too expensive like wren and six was just reprinted. I wonder if that would help wild, reprinting some staples for this format into standard packs
[2022-12-24 10:44:45] <bigdgamerboi> make hunter great again? Jebaited or at least have fun with DK Rexxar <3
[2022-12-24 10:46:09] <Xenth1s> i think barrier of entry to wild is just too high for new players

[2022-12-24 10:46:29] <Xenth1s> you need a lot of old expansions/card that can be only used in one deck in wild

[2022-12-24 10:46:44] <+pickle_bolas> @xenth1s yeah it is, waaaaay too many narrow legendary cards
[2022-12-24 10:47:01] <Xenth1s> and wild has oppresive meta with decks like neptulon priest/secret mage that just gutter homebrews
[2022-12-24 10:47:43] <%+LinkYas> Chat Not working???
[2022-12-24 10:47:54] <+0ddler_> if you have a low enough mmr i bet you could enjoy wild with some bad decks, otherwise your deck has to be pretty focused on what its doing

[2022-12-24 10:48:36] <Xenth1s> token druid costs like 2k dust and is T1 in standard for several months
[2022-12-24 10:49:00] <Senihoo> @xenth1s you mean years?
[2022-12-24 10:49:11] <galacticlobster> token druid also gets boring so quickly
[2022-12-24 10:49:18] <+0ddler_> yeah but that token druid rotates, more expensive to keep up with standard. thats why i think so many players dust cards at rotation
[2022-12-24 10:50:16] <Xenth1s> idk i think wild goes into direction of more of disrupting enemy wincon than having wincon by yourself

[2022-12-24 10:50:36] <+0ddler_> look at secret mage as an example, you could have that as one of your decks and every couple expansion you get one card upgrade etc
