[2022-12-30 06:09:55] <%medricx> Would definitely rather standard arena than wild with boomer sets
[2022-12-30 06:10:08] VIEWERS: 213
[2022-12-30 06:10:39] <%+dannfuller> There's almost always going to be 1-2 classes that just don't have Arena-friendly sets (Hunter, Warrior now) and 1 or 2 classes that are over the top. I feel like the goal should be to have 7-8 honestly viable classes, if that means a win-rate spread of 47-53% for the ~9 classes, then so be it.
[2022-12-30 06:11:13] <%+ashy111101> I've found playing arena semi casual the last few years, that playing more, watching yourself and other streamers had upped my Winrate because I make less stupid small mistakes
[2022-12-30 06:11:25] <fearthereaper87> What format is arena on atm {wild}?

[2022-12-30 06:12:36] <%+dannfuller> Yeah, there were 2 viable classes 2 weeks ago, there's at least 6 now. Which is a start
[2022-12-30 06:12:50] <TheOncomingS> i actually fully support wild arena, rotations are good idea in theory but it still always ends up unbalanced anyway so why bother

[2022-12-30 06:14:20] <%medricx> i feel like they need to just put in the work to let them have more control over the discover pool too

[2022-12-30 06:14:35] <%medricx> instead of just nerfing discover card offering rates
[2022-12-30 06:14:50] <@%Queen__Ari> they cant code
[2022-12-30 06:15:03] <%+dannfuller> Yeah, Death Knight doesn't have 25 cards from Frozen Throne, Witchwood, and Naxx.

[2022-12-30 06:16:38] <@%Queen__Ari> dormant is designed very well
[2022-12-30 06:16:51] <%talrielz> as someone that likes winning, winning at the cost of arena's identity is not worth it to me. i was saying earlier in Dann's chat i went 12 with druid earlier and it didnt feel fun. every deck is the same and every game played out more or less the same
[2022-12-30 06:16:52] <@%gesticulate> 2 mana 4/5 YEP
[2022-12-30 06:17:02] <%+dannfuller> We talked about how the draft has evolved from "All 3 cards are the same rarity" to "changed the class/spell-weapon bonus" to "synergy picks" to "buckets" to "No buckets but also No longer grouping by Rarity gems"
[2022-12-30 06:17:29] <%+dannfuller> That's a lot of crap to shove into and out of the Arena-related codebase
[2022-12-30 06:17:31] <@%Queen__Ari> I am indeed
[2022-12-30 06:17:46] <%+ashy111101> that's why i prefer playing arena, yes class can be OP,  but it's not a guarantee it's good, depending who's playing the deck
[2022-12-30 06:17:56] <@%gesticulate> @Queen__Ari are you making a new year's apple cobbler?

[2022-12-30 06:18:52] <kp2416> Surely Blizzard have to fix DeathKnight asap right? I get they want people to play the new class but even when Demon Hunter was strong early in arena they micro adjusted it. Runs tend to depend on if you face 3 DK or not in your first 6-10 games
[2022-12-30 06:19:04] <@%gesticulate> @Queen__Ari no I made sugar cookies if you wanna decorate some

[2022-12-30 06:22:03] <%+Jurbek> and thus speed runs were born
[2022-12-30 06:22:08] VIEWERS: 296
[2022-12-30 06:22:11] <%+dannfuller> Definitely agree that 1-2 wins should get 50g and a pack. No dust, no cards. That removes "penalty" rewards and you always just buy a pack and get to play 3-5 games.
[2022-12-30 06:22:53] <%talrielz> last meta i dont even think the best players in the world could average 7 wins lol
[2022-12-30 06:22:55] <%+ashy111101> but another of my losses in arena come from op cards
[2022-12-30 06:22:59] <%talrielz> unless they rolled dk every other run
[2022-12-30 06:23:34] <%medricx> My win average is 4.7 according to HearthArena, is that actually decent?

[2022-12-30 06:26:13] <%+ashy111101> in a sense that, maybe of the 30 cards drafted we all should draft 2 rolls as legendary rather than it completely random, because how powerful they are

[2022-12-30 06:28:39] <%+ashy111101> what would be the biggest change for arena you'd want red
[2022-12-30 06:28:42] <%talrielz> @dannfuller through the roof baby
[2022-12-30 06:28:55] <%medricx> Wow there's really cool stats on Heatharena. I've gone 0 wins 5 times and 12 wins 6 times.
[2022-12-30 06:28:59] <pasmandoo> Good stream!
[2022-12-30 06:29:14] <%medricx> i mean opposite 6 0 win and 5 12 win
[2022-12-30 06:29:17] <%blondejohn96> the issue with leaderboards is sometimes dreads makes them and that might be discouraging for people

[2022-12-30 06:29:25] <%+dannfuller> They made it sound like the Sept/October one wasn't going to be published but they would pick up again (possibly in a new form/cadence) with the new year

[2022-12-30 06:29:44] <%talrielz> the funniest thing about the irrelevancy of leaderboards cuz it does nothing in game for me was that when i was the current reigning dual server #1 i had a guy add me and then shit talk my constructed rank telling me how bad i am at hearthstone

[2022-12-30 08:21:44] <%Veritas_12647> I can't get behind that. I think that in the "classic" meta, if you were newer you stood way less of a chance to get to high wins. The start of this expansion all it took was hitting a 3/11 to put yourself on the easy track to high wins.
[2022-12-30 08:22:32] <%Veritas_12647> Or you're me and all 11 of my drafts would miss. FeelsRainMan

[2022-12-30 09:04:25] <%+deformedpoet> lets face it queenie and taz are kind hot but the fact that they spend time severely limits their quantifiable bonafides, you would have to say their judgement is lacking. what if you were in a life and death situation? can you actually trust they have the survival instincts to pull you through
[2022-12-30 09:04:36] <%+deformedpoet> man i am glad my 10 minuted time out is over
[2022-12-30 09:04:36] <KULIXIS> @RedBeard gin or vodka and olive juice
[2022-12-30 09:04:45] <sparvelCS> Gin and vermouth, its very good

[2022-12-30 09:07:07] <KULIXIS> Jerky is so expensive because they take all the water out of the meat. You can make it go much further if you soak the meat in water first.
[2022-12-30 09:07:22] <%talrielz> ive been told i have pretty good eyelashes but my skills are pretty exclusive to being angry about things
[2022-12-30 09:07:34] <sparvelCS> when i started watching dekkster he always wore flanell shirts and trucker caps, so in hindisght that was all a sharade to seem handy. what a FRAUD

[2022-12-30 09:10:52] <%talrielz> wait what is happening with the peehole? after two dudes in a sandbox i sorta avoided the peehole videos but maybe i made too quick of a judgment
[2022-12-30 09:10:53] <%medricx> vermouth is a spirit
[2022-12-30 09:10:59] VIEWERS: 740
[2022-12-30 09:11:05] <KULIXIS> Vermouth is more vinegar taste than wine taste

[2022-12-30 09:11:21] <sparvelCS> but that was my question, remove the olives and replace them with sweet golden raisins????
[2022-12-30 09:11:25] <%medricx> technically a wine, but it goes in the spirits aisle lol

[2022-12-30 09:22:21] <@%Tazny> I guess the downside to that betting idea is that if you happen to be the first person to bet, youd get absolutely insane odds when you maybe dont deserve them as the real odds wouldnt be determined yet

[2022-12-30 09:31:59] <%Synastar> The Island of Doctor Moreau is an 1896 science fiction novel by English author H. G. Wells (1866‚Äì1946). The text of the novel is the narration of Edward Prendick who is a shipwrecked man rescued by a passing boat. He is left on the island home of Doctor Moreau, a mad scientist who creates human-like hybrid beings from animals via vivisection.

[2022-12-30 10:25:45] <@%Tazny> Youtube sometimes age restricts videos and the only way to view them is to verify your age, and the only way to do that is to either send them your photo ID or credit card. Like, no Im not giving you that information to watch a fookin video that probably has one swear word in it

[2022-12-30 12:06:02] <LittleWing322> Maybe weak core
[2022-12-30 12:06:09] <!%Ellyon> I'm off topic like always, but I just 'burped'. And when I burp it doesn't make the sound, just air comes out :( Is this a severe medical condition? Probably...
[2022-12-30 12:06:09] <zifirt> it is cosmetic
[2022-12-30 12:06:21] <%Kaguyavn> yeah you pay money to make your card uglier
[2022-12-30 12:06:23] <%NippyLeanz2021> could be lack of vitamin D
[2022-12-30 12:06:27] <%$fittyleben> Yeh sounds like weak core/ weak back.

[2022-12-30 12:08:08] <kthyress> I did hear that each expansion's signature cards will have different designs
[2022-12-30 12:08:32] <LittleWing322> also that DK gif is comically bad
[2022-12-30 12:08:34] <kthyress> hopefully the next set is more colorful and vibrant
[2022-12-30 12:08:35] <%grimeto> You shouldn't have checked Red, sometimes ignorance is better
[2022-12-30 12:08:37] <%+TennisDamo> the worst ting about signatures is it takes away everything that is amazing about legendary cards. they lose the boarder and everything thats naughty and nice
[2022-12-30 12:08:38] <%NippyLeanz2021> i think the frame is ok if the portrait actually had colour
[2022-12-30 12:08:40] <kthyress> and moving
