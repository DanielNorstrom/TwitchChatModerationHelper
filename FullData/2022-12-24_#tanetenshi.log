[2022-12-24 04:49:43] <%Chimon_VT> Tane, if you open a pack from the back, remove the code card, then move the back 3 cards to the front, you can reveal the cards until the rare card is the final reveal
[2022-12-24 04:49:48] <%+Talthar> Sensei, you should do Smash or Pass while you do this

[2022-12-24 05:46:51] <%Chimon_VT> btw Tane, you can tell if the pack might be good or not depending on the code card. If it's black/dark, there's a higher chance of a good card. If it's white, you lose the gacha

[2022-12-24 05:48:12] <%Greedybaconking> that system is dependent on the set because if you go to older sets it was white codes that would determine if you had a chance at a ultra rare

[2022-12-24 09:03:00] <@%^Nightbot> We are currently watching It's a Wonderful Life! Although It's a Wonderful Life initially received mixed reviews and was unsuccessful at the box office, it became a Christmas classic after its copyright lapsed and it fell into the public domain, which allowed it to be broadcast without licensing or royalty fees.

Although It's a Wonderful Life initially received mixed reviews and was unsuccessful at the box office, it became a Christmas classic after its copyright lapsed and it fell into the public domain, which allowed it to be broadcast without licensing or royalty fees.
