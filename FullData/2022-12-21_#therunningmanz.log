[2022-12-21 17:15:35] <+ILoveCoachYT> @TheRunningManZ  sorry i ment when you have facemask on when you sneeze it takes longer to get sickness away because youre sneezing in mask
[2022-12-21 17:15:41] <%$catfishghilly> Masks are to prevent getting and infecting others haha not keeping you sick

[2022-12-21 17:16:22] <@%Unclefood> @the_dailynomad See, that you think need to ask how to disinfect a canteen (just dump it out) but you insist a mask can make you sick ;)
[2022-12-21 17:16:29] <@%Feast_130> @Unclefood but 360_noscopez said it on reddit somewhere so must be true
[2022-12-21 17:16:35] <%the_dailynomad> @feast_130 it wasn't cold, it was salmonella. i cured it, then got it again without drinking anything I acquired new, only my own water which is good. so I think i got sick again either from facemask or drinking from my own infected canteen that got infected from me
[2022-12-21 17:16:50] <%+jHussle> wheres ish?

[2022-12-21 17:18:56] <rev0luzion> @Unclefood not after dumping . i mean if he got sick from the canteen then cured it if he didnt change the water he probably just got it from canteen again

[2022-12-21 17:19:15] <+TheMetalClone> @the_dailynomad if you get sick while wearing a facemask, pretty sure youll continue to get sick until you disinfect the mask. also, if you drank from a canteen that you didnt dump out first that will do it.

[2022-12-21 17:21:32] <+TheMetalClone> @the_dailynomad so you literally need to cure yourself of your sickness, then use an alcoholic tincture with your mask WHILE you are cured. if you just disinfect while youre sick, it wont work

[2022-12-21 17:35:00] <OldMan_Birch> @therunningmanz back when we could disinfect the masks it was definitely a thing that the mask would hold a sickness I thought. I don‚Äôt believe the mechanic is in the game anymore though. As long as you get full stats then it should all get cured.

[2022-12-21 17:50:10] <@%Unclefood> @lewis5846 Every month but you have to manually do it
[2022-12-21 17:50:12] <+AdamWas_Here> @lewis5846 you get one free one every month to use on whoever you want

[2022-12-21 19:41:26] <%TheZigorkyBarKid> @t0yotaprevia Without getting to technical, if the whiskey is going to be used with a mixer, then probably not worth spending too much. If however you want to drink it neat then taste becomes more important as does the price

[2022-12-21 19:41:54] <NomChompsky58008> the oil from the rind is what's so strong. the oil is a hundred times more "orangey" than the juice

[2022-12-21 22:35:25] <+Tassen87> Fortnite still big,  pubg not so much.
[2022-12-21 22:35:25] <Secrytt> yer you cant copyright a genre lol
[2022-12-21 22:35:26] <%$DBearIt> Pubg is way better then fortnite lol
[2022-12-21 22:35:27] <%OllieKampo> @johnytwitch30 yep, played it last night
[2022-12-21 22:35:34] <cthulusquid> fortnite is shite lol
[2022-12-21 22:35:37] <@%Unclefood> @MileHighOde "I believe" is always a safe way out, or just don't say it without looking things up first ;)
[2022-12-21 22:35:40] <%+CrowdCtrlAlt> Yep total copy
[2022-12-21 22:35:41] <%$BPMETALMILITIA> @crowdctrlalt They made ice cubes out of stainless steel and granite stones that don't melt.
[2022-12-21 22:35:44] <+shankapotomus22> i think pubg was the only battle royale at the time
[2022-12-21 22:35:47] <klumtera> tbh they made another battle royal. neither invented it
[2022-12-21 22:35:48] <@%+Redline_Si> Do we know any more about PlayerUnknowns next game?

[2022-12-21 22:36:06] <Rise0fTheFallen> Fortnite still had millions of casual players a day
[2022-12-21 22:36:07] <%+freundlichetretmine> no they didnt... both were released in the same year. pubg in march 2017 and fortnite in june...

[2022-12-21 22:36:11] <+callumk28> Pubg is bug-ridden
[2022-12-21 22:36:12] <supitskal> its gonna flop it they keep the same PUBG mentality
[2022-12-21 22:36:14] <%yakumo_subaru> Pubg is still a videogame, Forknife... well...
[2022-12-21 22:36:16] <RamaXDL> Fortnite is 100% better than pubg Lol
[2022-12-21 22:36:23] <%+CrowdCtrlAlt> @bpmetalmilitia for that reason LUL room temp best for tasting also, so stay away from those too
[2022-12-21 22:36:26] <SwartzT> @kevkev311 it‚Äôs a $520 mil settlement over children‚Äôs privacy and payment systems tricking players into making unintended purchases

[2022-12-21 22:36:37] <%Skippski> I got a 6 year old and a 8 year old and they love fortnite. I hear their voice chat and honestly its all little kids
[2022-12-21 22:36:37] <%+cannonfodder81> The first BR was in arma
[2022-12-21 22:36:39] <%DelTree_> one of the coolest things ever was me saying in a random stream how bad pubg looked and then i got a whisper from Brendan Greene with a key asking me to try it myself
[2022-12-21 22:36:39] <oks4ne> TRMZ‚úåÔ∏èWay to go!!!
[2022-12-21 22:36:39] <%+toppa35> @klumtera true, but in fairness PU was kinda in at the groundlevel, coming from ARMA BR and stuff
[2022-12-21 22:36:45] <+callumk28> Fortnite is simply the better game like it or not
[2022-12-21 22:36:47] <%+TheGoodDoctor88> I thought I'd never touch Fortnite, until that No Build was released. it's fucking fun as hell
[2022-12-21 22:36:51] <%$DBearIt> Pubg is solid game I don‚Äôt get why more people don‚Äôt play it. Least it don‚Äôt have loadouts
[2022-12-21 22:36:52] <@%Unclefood> @Redline_Si I'd love to see something like it but..
[2022-12-21 22:36:59] <%englishmanzintheport> they should add dances to dayz then we could see the @runningmanz do the running man
[2022-12-21 22:37:05] <skitsbeam> fortnite without building? thats the only good thing abt the game lol
[2022-12-21 22:37:11] <%+d0p3b1scuit> Civi barracks I thtink

[2022-12-21 22:37:23] <+worty2828> didn't pubg kind of copy H1Z1
[2022-12-21 22:37:23] <%$BPMETALMILITIA> @crowdctrlalt will do bud. Trying different whiskey this holiday season
[2022-12-21 22:37:25] <%Skippski> H1Z1 just dies when PUBG came out
[2022-12-21 22:37:25] <dayzen69> my mem is as long as nats peen
[2022-12-21 22:37:26] <%$DBearIt> Fortnite is easier and more popular lol doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs a better game
[2022-12-21 22:37:28] <kevkev311> Proximity chat in pubg was the best
[2022-12-21 22:37:32] <corey_heggie> Merry Christmas when I comes Paul, hope you and the family have a good one!
[2022-12-21 22:37:33] <%simonlh95> pubg got worse i think were they put in sutch things like pink rabbit outfits and soo on
[2022-12-21 22:37:36] <%yakumo_subaru> I miss Double Dragon LUL
[2022-12-21 22:37:48] <IMAMONSTA22> is there anytihng like pc specialist in the states?
[2022-12-21 22:37:51] <%adzz177> playerunknown made h1z1 didnt he?
[2022-12-21 22:37:53] <klumtera> lol no it didnt! it was taking from the old battle royals from arma 2 dayz
[2022-12-21 22:38:02] <Jyfex> and h1z1 copied player unknowns arma 2 br mod
[2022-12-21 22:38:03] <%+FunkyGez> @d0p3b1scuit I love the word you just created....thtink...gonna use that
[2022-12-21 22:38:04] <%K0D3R_> @worty2828 the guy who started PUBG was the same person who helped sony/daybreak make H1's BR
[2022-12-21 22:38:09] <evilmorbius> they are the same
[2022-12-21 22:38:15] <@%Unclefood> H1Z1 wanted to be a DayZ clone and it was TOO HARD, so they switched to a Battle Royale

[2022-12-21 22:38:24] <%$DBearIt> @unclefood I have played it lol just saying it‚Äôs not terrible.
[2022-12-21 22:38:26] <+pobitta> H1Z1 was a bit cursed
[2022-12-21 22:38:29] <RonZacapaX> has anyone played a game that gets your heart rate going faster than dayz? its the only game I've played which physically shits you up

[2022-12-21 22:38:32] <%AllOnBlack> Arma 3 BR was great
[2022-12-21 22:38:34] <b14q> I thought Arma 2 Battle Royale came before the Dayz mod
[2022-12-21 22:38:34] <Kuzenogan> minecraft had the OG battle royale servers too, like waaaay back when
[2022-12-21 22:38:36] <paytime666> why not update h1z1 to xbox ???
[2022-12-21 22:38:38] <dayzen69> yep
[2022-12-21 22:38:39] <%+mrnoobels> Anyone know if the reports from the UK of electricity being really 3X the amount this winter. Honest Question
[2022-12-21 22:38:39] <supitskal> h1z1 will never be replaced in terms of BR
[2022-12-21 22:38:42] <+alcarp> so basically dayz is fortnite Kappa
[2022-12-21 22:38:43] <@%Unclefood> @DBearIt We both know its awful ;)

[2022-12-21 22:38:46] <evilmorbius> DayZ is the only original i guess
[2022-12-21 22:38:47] <+ryzin6> @RonZacapaX tarkov
[2022-12-21 22:38:47] <%+Neris4> Dayz was originally an Arma mod
[2022-12-21 22:38:48] <%+movemaker_> @RonZacapaX agreed
[2022-12-21 22:38:51] <%+Lunasnino1989> i used to run a DayZ epoch server, it was so good
[2022-12-21 22:38:55] <klumtera> yeah way more arcady than pubg
[2022-12-21 22:38:59] <%yakumo_subaru> Arma II is the Godfather
[2022-12-21 22:39:00] <Smallsss_> it would be sick if pubg vehicles were in day z
[2022-12-21 22:39:01] <+EpochZ_Grahame> PlayerUnknown was doing BR on ARMA 2
[2022-12-21 22:39:03] <Secrytt> all good games for there ime imo
[2022-12-21 22:39:04] <kevkev311> Yep
[2022-12-21 22:39:08] <%DelTree_> i never played arma 3 br because it seemed too intimidating
[2022-12-21 22:39:13] <jamie56k> Well yeah dayz is like a battle royale you cant win
[2022-12-21 22:39:24] <@%Unclefood> @Neris4 True, and Bohemia hired the modder to make a Stand Alone game of DayZ :D
[2022-12-21 22:39:25] <kevkev311> Like doc
[2022-12-21 22:39:27] <%the_dailynomad> do you think with all the competition in games now, dayz is on ots deathbed?
[2022-12-21 22:39:29] <%$DBearIt> @unclefood I don‚Äôt like the movement lol it makes me feel sick of it hard better movement I prob play it more honestly
[2022-12-21 22:39:34] <+pobitta> There was alot of drama surrounding H1Z1 in the beginning
[2022-12-21 22:39:35] <Paradise_X0> Pubg has changed alot. The skill ceiling is so high now.
[2022-12-21 22:39:41] <+insulinjunky6t9> dayz and pubg are pretty close. just no survival mechanic's
[2022-12-21 22:39:43] <%+FunkyGez> @the_dailynomad nope
[2022-12-21 22:39:49] <%$DBearIt> Fortnite is fun with my kids but I would never play it all the time lol

[2022-12-21 22:40:26] <dyoaks1> It‚Äôs getting a lot more playable on console with each update. I‚Äôd assume that has a reason with the increased player base
[2022-12-21 22:40:30] <+alcarp> nothing comparesto  dayz,  there were them games which tried too but were lacking, SCuM i think?

[2022-12-21 22:40:47] <%+FunkyGez> no survival game like dayz at all. nothing comes close, which is kind of annoying, as competition is good
[2022-12-21 22:40:52] <%$DBearIt> The skill ceiling is high in pubg. New players r matched with level 500 lol they don‚Äôt have player base to separate it some how for newer players
[2022-12-21 22:41:07] <@%Unclefood> H1Z1 tried to clone DayZ, it was shit, Sony Online Entertainment abandoned it and dumped it on DayBreak, they made a BR. It was popular for a while via Summit, now... no one cares
[2022-12-21 22:41:18] <RonZacapaX> I suppose dayz wouldn't be so intense if you didn't have the 3 hours of looting before hand with nothing happening.
[2022-12-21 22:41:18] <sloppie2ndz> i always get good pvp here
[2022-12-21 22:41:26] <@%Unclefood> This is what happens to games that try and compete with DayZ
[2022-12-21 22:41:28] <%+toppa35> @insulinjunky6t9 its because they both found there origins in arma mods
