[2022-12-21 16:30:57] <+bayerr__> to be able to flip easily i guess
[2022-12-21 16:31:04] <%madgmm91> @viking_nephilim if the point invested are the same there is no highest
[2022-12-21 16:31:10] <elektronno> 15
[2022-12-21 16:31:11] <Vituperator> is this autonomy adjusteed dev or real dev to flip?

[2022-12-21 16:31:25] <efes__> @Tazhel not 25% per se: you can only flip to the highest percentage religion, so it's easier if you have more religions

[2022-12-21 17:41:56] <%Knuttiface> When Florryworry has 10 loans he feels that he's in a great position and thus he does not hesitate to take more loans. When Florryworry has 20 loans he thinks that he is at a disadvantage and so he takes more loans to improve his economy. When florryworry has 40 loans he thinks that he has reached a desperate situation and is only waiting passively for bankruptcy if he does not take more loans.
