[2022-12-30 09:42:57] <~%CeriseVT> idk if changing browsers really fixes the core issue
[2022-12-30 09:43:22] <!%Nimnitz> Especially if the other browser are still open
[2022-12-30 09:43:51] <~%CeriseVT> the thing is
[2022-12-30 09:43:55] <~%CeriseVT> if you have so many things open
[2022-12-30 09:44:04] <~%CeriseVT> you are not going to watch most of them ever
[2022-12-30 09:44:08] <~%CeriseVT> or you just build up more
[2022-12-30 09:44:16] <!%+Galondir> The other browser isnt open, only the new browser, the thing is that other people have said they have gotten this bug with "no sprint"  as well so yokaiShrug
[2022-12-30 09:44:17] <~%CeriseVT> let the old ones go and just keep up with things that are interesting

[2022-12-30 10:19:33] <bunglinglummox> a cat in a cage is pretty much ignored by the game logic, so they won't have nearly as much framerate impact

[2022-12-30 10:50:57] <bunglinglummox> @Quitutatur I mean, sure. But I still want an easy way to turn it off. I could mod the raws, but if you remove gods entirely it does weird things to worldgen.
[2022-12-30 10:51:06] <McMarschall> yeah someone explain the justice system too me as well, my artifacts keep getting stolen by dwarfs on behest of humans rooD

[2022-12-30 10:52:42] <McMarschall> @McMarschall rooKek I have so many visitors that criminals are a problems and I stopped taking on monster hunters because they keep dying in my caves roo4
[2022-12-30 10:52:45] <Quitutatur> so investigations may uncover those plots to steal artifacts and the crimes will be shown there so you can convict them of the crimes
[2022-12-30 10:52:51] <Synesh> Deoends by the location of your fort
[2022-12-30 10:52:52] <bunglinglummox> I mean, I suppose there's the annual goblin "visits".
[2022-12-30 10:53:20] <Quitutatur> Captain of the guard should do those jobs of investigation
[2022-12-30 10:53:21] <bunglinglummox> And of course that one time a necromancer siege happened and I thought I was done, before I realised all the zombies were armed with wooden weapons.
[2022-12-30 10:53:51] <McMarschall> @Quitutatur problem for me multible times now is that the culprit does not have the artifact anymore because he gave it to a visitor that left as soon as he got it rooF

[2022-12-30 10:57:25] <McMarschall> @verajonson rooHi rooHug
[2022-12-30 10:57:27] <Quitutatur> but i guess there aren't that many factions on my world since i just got my fort into the second age of legends because of how much murdering i did
[2022-12-30 10:57:36] <Synesh> If you choose a different dwarf culture, it changes their "area of influence." as in to say, the area where you can make a fortress and still expect migrants and trade

[2022-12-30 11:01:01] <McMarschall> light aquafiers are fine, just build walls and be comfy rooC
[2022-12-30 11:01:04] <Synesh> I thought it was simple pools of water to work around. No it's litteraly endless water leaking through walls. Even brick ones.
[2022-12-30 11:01:09] <Quitutatur> Light aquifers are a lot easier and decent sources of water but heavy is hellish

[2022-12-30 11:01:49] <Quitutatur> I love my Silver Hammer Lords
[2022-12-30 11:01:58] <Synesh> I think you can deal with them by smoothing the walls. Unfortunatly it's all clay

[2022-12-30 13:14:05] <Seve82> build massive bridge to middle of lava and make hotell in there
[2022-12-30 13:14:14] <Seve82> no quest will ever be cold
[2022-12-30 13:14:21] <@%Erazu> excessive ass licking could be a sign of parasites and shit
[2022-12-30 13:14:34] VIEWERS: 239
[2022-12-30 13:14:35] <Sakatchi> that sounds like good idea, what could even go wrong
[2022-12-30 13:14:51] <Graknorke> happiness is a bit difficult, dwarves have a strong bias towards memories they already have so once they're unhappy it's a lot of work to improve their mood
[2022-12-30 13:14:54] <Sakatchi> just get fireproof wood. easy
[2022-12-30 13:14:59] <%+Kaithar> sounds like you're designing a trading camp for the elves
[2022-12-30 13:15:00] <Quitutatur> you actually made me think of some funny contraptions now LUL
[2022-12-30 13:15:03] <%$Memil03> My dogs gets parasites  sometimes or well worms and when they do they lick alot of ass yokaiSweat
[2022-12-30 13:15:10] <@%Erazu> but unless he eats some other dog's shit outside, that seems unlikely
[2022-12-30 13:15:13] <Graknorke> but the flip side is that if you show them a bunch of stuff they like early on they're pretty resilient to bad things happening
[2022-12-30 13:15:28] <Quitutatur> Bridge raising to lava and a Garbage Dump set on top of it... just press dah button to throw the thingies into lava LUL
[2022-12-30 13:15:47] <%+Kaithar> elves go great with lava
[2022-12-30 13:16:33] <Graknorke> creatures in DF have... I think it's seven slots for long term memories. so if you can blitz them with mostly positive experiences you can fill those up pretty quick

[2022-12-30 13:16:46] <Quitutatur> i haven't tested it yet cerise and i'm mostly thinking of it as a war catapult
[2022-12-30 13:16:54] <rylexander0> @Kaithar Its great for their skin
[2022-12-30 13:16:57] <Seve82> yeah lava can be used as nice defense for the colony
[2022-12-30 13:17:18] <%FinalCipher> ooh delicious magma crabs
[2022-12-30 13:17:22] <Seve82> magma KREB! FeelsAmazingMan
[2022-12-30 13:17:27] <Seve82> NomNomNom!
[2022-12-30 13:17:35] <%FinalCipher> does this mean we can fish the lava?
[2022-12-30 13:17:37] <Quitutatur> hmm i wonder if that would be better for my hospital instead of a hole in the walls
[2022-12-30 13:17:43] <Sakatchi> Elves reproduce by being on fire you know. Elves are weird
[2022-12-30 13:18:16] <%FinalCipher> yeah they refuse to let you butcher animals but they'll eat anyone they defeat in a war
[2022-12-30 13:18:20] <%$Memil03> Its gotta be so hot for that poor dwarf xD
[2022-12-30 13:18:22] <Quitutatur> What? it sounds funny LUL
[2022-12-30 13:18:24] <bunglinglummox> @Quitutatur you know you can pit things in the magma directly without using a bridge, right?
[2022-12-30 13:18:35] VIEWERS: 236
[2022-12-30 13:18:44] <%FinalCipher> the bridge makes it more dramatic though
[2022-12-30 13:18:46] <%+Kaithar> you can usually tell how many accidental wood trades a player has made by how sociopathic their treatment of Elves are
[2022-12-30 13:18:48] <Seve82> you can build floor over lava
[2022-12-30 13:18:49] <Graknorke> pit is a zone
[2022-12-30 13:18:59] <Quitutatur> well yeah... but isn't the bridge more fun? LUL and i was planning on using it on war instead of the zone Pit/pond
[2022-12-30 13:19:00] <Graknorke> pit/pond
[2022-12-30 13:19:00] <+vodsquad4life> savisePeekk savisePeekk savisePeekk hi hi
[2022-12-30 13:19:03] <%FinalCipher> yeah you make a pit zone basically
[2022-12-30 13:19:40] <%FinalCipher> but making the pit at the end of the bridge means your dwarves can take a nice slow walk before epically yeeting the marmot skeleton into the boiling abyss
[2022-12-30 13:19:40] <Graknorke> wait no
[2022-12-30 13:19:49] <Graknorke> pit is for creatures
[2022-12-30 13:19:59] <Graknorke> garbage dump is what you want for items
[2022-12-30 13:20:04] <Graknorke> yeah you got it

[2022-12-30 13:21:42] <Sakatchi> looks like your bridge bulder  dwarf keeps getting heat stroke or something lol
[2022-12-30 13:22:07] <Seve82> with some luck you get to witness tantrum cascade death of the colony
[2022-12-30 13:22:09] <+SkittlesTC> I was gonna say having the fort directly open to the lava lake terrifies me
[2022-12-30 13:22:19] <+SkittlesTC> Yeah lol i was thinking about those tantrums

[2022-12-30 13:49:29] <%+Kaithar> someone needs to make a mod  that lets cats dig for you

[2022-12-30 13:49:32] <Quitutatur> i understand how minecarts work... i don't understand how i would use them well
[2022-12-30 13:49:43] <Seve82> this vote is #rigged

[2022-12-30 13:51:42] <bunglinglummox> the only thing I ever use minecarts for is the trick that lets dwarves haul magma

[2022-12-30 13:52:14] <bunglinglummox> if you can fill a cart with magma, dwarves will happily carry it overland to a point of your choosing whether you have a track made or not

[2022-12-30 14:27:26] <+SkittlesTC> it should be in the game, but for some reason accessing logs has been removed other than what you see at the side
[2022-12-30 14:27:29] <%angelsforce> gtgh
[2022-12-30 14:27:30] <Quitutatur> oh yeah the last death against the trees was the most tragic one... a mother died while carrying her baby and both got completely crushed by the tree
[2022-12-30 14:27:34] <+catteusofmars> you can read the combat log if someone pushed em but if they  jumped eeeh
[2022-12-30 14:27:46] <+SkittlesTC> I think its a steam release quirk, he's definitely gonna bring logs back
[2022-12-30 14:27:51] <+catteusofmars> the original had "log" that had EVERYTHING but it gone now
[2022-12-30 14:27:53] <+SkittlesTC> it was a big part of old df
[2022-12-30 14:28:04] <%angelsforce> dont let tengu trick you into not tie votes from now on, chat^^
[2022-12-30 14:28:28] <Quitutatur> is the gamelog txt not in the files? gotta check now
[2022-12-30 14:28:29] <%angelsforce> just saying^^
[2022-12-30 14:28:31] <+SkittlesTC> unfortunately i can be tricked very easily
[2022-12-30 14:28:45] VIEWERS: 241
[2022-12-30 14:29:04] <+catteusofmars> could be on purpose to stop players from playing one frame at time and reading the log :3
[2022-12-30 14:29:28] <+SkittlesTC> yeah lots of people did that to follow combat step by step
[2022-12-30 14:29:38] <+catteusofmars> thats what i did :3
[2022-12-30 14:29:41] <%+ashura422> hello there
[2022-12-30 14:29:54] <Quitutatur> oh yeah the gamelog txt isn't logging anything now huh

[2022-12-30 14:30:14] <Spectre_84> that looks liker a decent brawl
[2022-12-30 14:30:18] <Seve82> someone murdured dorf child
[2022-12-30 14:30:20] <%+phantomsalmon> damn, child got murdered
[2022-12-30 14:30:21] <+SkittlesTC> i feel like you could be pretty close to a tantrum spiral
[2022-12-30 14:30:33] <%$Memil03> i think i know why you have so many drinks now xD all your dwarfs are dying xD
[2022-12-30 14:30:34] <Spectre_84> so many angry dorfs XD
[2022-12-30 14:30:42] <+catteusofmars> kekw now THAT is a good scrap
[2022-12-30 14:30:43] <Quitutatur> Child killed? tantrum spiral from the mother getting berserk and trying to kill everyone around her

[2022-12-30 14:31:22] <Spectre_84> time to banish half the fort
[2022-12-30 14:31:31] <+catteusofmars> how big hospital did you build?
[2022-12-30 14:31:38] <+catteusofmars> and is doctor still alive :D
[2022-12-30 14:31:43] <Quitutatur> brawling under influence LUL this is actually a drunken fight and not one of depression
[2022-12-30 14:31:46] <%+phantomsalmon> I find that mental breaks of colonists in Rimworld are more manageable
[2022-12-30 14:31:49] <Seve82> time to make the angry dorf attack force and "export" the problems LUL
[2022-12-30 14:31:56] <Spectre_84> do you have a justice system set up? :D
[2022-12-30 14:31:57] <%$Memil03> well thx to so many dwards dying you got food an drinks now
[2022-12-30 14:31:58] <Quitutatur> check the event log below the baby one the second alert
[2022-12-30 14:32:16] <Quitutatur> someone is literally "brawling under influence" LUL
[2022-12-30 14:32:33] <Spectre_84> tavern brawls are fun
[2022-12-30 14:32:39] <Spectre_84> they can destroy a fort
[2022-12-30 14:32:42] <%+Kaithar> the realism is outstanding
[2022-12-30 14:32:45] VIEWERS: 237
[2022-12-30 14:32:50] <Quitutatur> you deleted the log for that
[2022-12-30 14:32:59] <bunglinglummox> I mean, most things can detroy a fort.
[2022-12-30 14:33:04] <Spectre_84> tru
[2022-12-30 14:33:04] <bunglinglummox> Dwarves are sort of unstable.

[2022-12-30 14:39:56] <+catteusofmars> looked wrong
[2022-12-30 14:39:58] <Seve82> some dorfs are traitors who have joined the goblins
[2022-12-30 14:40:01] <%AriaNottoVT> pretty blue
[2022-12-30 14:40:05] <Vyctorian> I think dwarf wars can happen due to world gen reasons
[2022-12-30 14:40:12] <Seve82> as in they was kidnapped and turned to evil dorfs
[2022-12-30 14:40:18] <Quitutatur> Goblins snatchers grab children and brainwash them into thinking they are goblins
[2022-12-30 14:40:22] <Vyctorian> @Seve82 or kidnapped dwsrf children
[2022-12-30 14:40:32] <+catteusofmars> they can also happen for player reasons like kill someone in bar or mess with trader etc

[2022-12-30 14:41:42] <Quitutatur> this was a pretty decent fortress actually
[2022-12-30 14:41:52] <Seve82> when you make new colony in df next month don't abandon the old map
[2022-12-30 14:42:09] <Seve82> yes keep the world
[2022-12-30 14:42:17] <Quitutatur> retire your fort and keep the world yeah
[2022-12-30 14:42:20] <%+phantomsalmon> I think that whatever Cerise says, it will end with Rimworld being most played again KEKW
[2022-12-30 14:42:26] <+SkittlesTC> that fortress was great compared to my earlier ones damn, and yeah i love using the saame world
