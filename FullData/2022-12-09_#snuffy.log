[2022-12-09 22:50:31] <%Starfyre687> Harvestella looks like a lot of fun
[2022-12-09 22:50:33] <%Geemsinator> ohh I wanted to check out harvestella, it looked cute
[2022-12-09 22:50:36] <%Arsenic_8> harvestella was fun, but still kinda rough to keep on it
[2022-12-09 22:50:38] <REDMVGE> yeah nah, when I saw Square releasing 3+ farming games within weeks I was like these can't be good
[2022-12-09 22:50:39] <+Tighron> i got that on my wishlist

[2022-12-09 22:50:50] <+Tighron> its more rpg than farm sim
[2022-12-09 22:50:53] <%$Shaggy_Baggums> They're just bloody action games these days, might as well play DMC or something instead.

[2022-12-09 22:51:02] <%StromkoPenguin> From the sounds of it, Harvestella seemed low budget considering its price.

[2022-12-09 22:57:39] <%StromkoPenguin> 9 does a really good job of capturing the charm of both old and modern FF. 8 and 10 and everything after just didn't do it for me.
[2022-12-09 22:57:40] <NidhoggSV> This is hearsay, but I'm pretty sure the reason 16 is going back to the European voices after 15 was not is because people made so much of a fuss about Barret in FF7R that Yoshi P said "Fine, you don't like our black characters? No more black characters."

[2022-12-09 22:58:16] <@%ZozzoTN> Death Stranding is a big love or hate thing
[2022-12-09 22:58:19] <Rapitor_> it's kojima, nothing makes sense
[2022-12-09 22:58:19] <@%+Leinhartt> I played it and I don't understand what's happening
[2022-12-09 22:58:23] <+thelaaxx> death stranding is typical kojima bullfuckery
[2022-12-09 22:58:23] <%$Capgun> TBF, it reallllly doesnt get much better if you do know whats going on

[2022-12-09 22:58:25] <Blaze420Kid99Faze360> first game is on the surface conclusive
[2022-12-09 22:58:26] <%$speedyeetboi> LUL
[2022-12-09 22:58:26] <%cg1003> thats just how kojima games are they are lore heavy and confusing
[2022-12-09 22:58:27] <%Bradwarden27> i kind of understand what is happening in this
[2022-12-09 22:58:27] <%$EmiKasumi> you can make some educated guesses but it's still cryptic
[2022-12-09 22:58:27] <%M8two> LUL

[2022-12-09 22:58:31] <Xega99> blossuHmm
[2022-12-09 22:58:33] <+Bakedgood> Kojima said theres a bunch of hidden details in this trailer
[2022-12-09 22:58:33] <+biggerbadderbread> All I remember about it is being a UPS guy
[2022-12-09 22:58:34] <%The_EchoVG> Yeah none of this trailer makes sense

[2022-12-09 23:02:28] <%$theRx_> Mr Funky Fetus
[2022-12-09 23:02:29] <%Samex_Comex> So it's gonna be like when they get big name actors for animated movies but taking it further
[2022-12-09 23:02:30] <%$GeeksGrimoire> cause its easier now to laser scan the actor and pay for their likeness than create a new face from scratch.
[2022-12-09 23:02:31] <%M8two> they can change the models tho right ?

[2022-12-09 23:03:04] <NidhoggSV> I think that's kinda beautiful in a way. We can have close-to-life representations of actors in our games and they're played by the actual actor. Like in a movie.
[2022-12-09 23:03:06] <%+The_Devastating_Lee> I mean maybe this fits the sentiment of wanting to play the shows and movies that you like to watch

[2022-12-09 23:03:27] <%$theRx_> I mean it's Kojima
[2022-12-09 23:03:28] <!%$lugEdit> its a playable movie
[2022-12-09 23:03:30] <%Atomicgodz> kojima games were always movies tbf
[2022-12-09 23:03:30] <SilverFeng> thats kojima
[2022-12-09 23:03:30] <%Deathmemester> Kojima makes movie games
[2022-12-09 23:03:31] <%$Capgun> Because Kojima doesnt make games, he makes interactive movies
[2022-12-09 23:03:32] <%$Aeyrgran> Troy snuffPray
[2022-12-09 23:03:33] <Acidic_Rue> thanks kojimbo
[2022-12-09 23:03:34] <@%Raikon_Z> single player rpgs are just playable movies tho
[2022-12-09 23:03:35] <%tropicalshark> y are they not vtubers Smadge
[2022-12-09 23:03:35] <NidhoggSV> It's great
[2022-12-09 23:03:38] <Blaze420Kid99Faze360> Corpa were a private corporation
[2022-12-09 23:03:41] <newspriteenteringrealm> its its own thing
[2022-12-09 23:03:41] <Logothete2401> That's just kojima being himself
[2022-12-09 23:03:42] <%+justatree2> I like playable movies
[2022-12-09 23:03:43] <Tsukana> Kojima has ALWAYS wanted to make films. That's his other passion. That's why all his games are like that
[2022-12-09 23:03:43] <+thelaaxx> kojima always loved american actors and film tbh
[2022-12-09 23:03:45] <DevilishBoredom> yeah troy
[2022-12-09 23:03:48] <%$GeeksGrimoire> not surprising, Kjima always said he wanted to direct movies than make games.
[2022-12-09 23:03:48] <%Chouko_Aio> I can't wait for death stranding 2
[2022-12-09 23:03:48] <+Toxic__Fry> thats cute guy is Troy Baker @snuffy
[2022-12-09 23:03:48] <RedEye92> Kojima tends to make very movie-ish games

[2022-12-09 23:03:54] <%19chris97> it could've been a movie by all means

[2022-12-09 23:03:57] <+TheOlMitcheroo> It's literally just Troy Baker
[2022-12-09 23:03:57] <lockedheart7> I'd rather characters stand on their own without celebrity actors needing to prop them up. If they can pull off both then great but I usually find it more distracting than anything
[2022-12-09 23:03:58] <%StromkoPenguin> Johnny Maskface
[2022-12-09 23:03:59] <vvvhollo> well yeah, triple A games have become more like movies
