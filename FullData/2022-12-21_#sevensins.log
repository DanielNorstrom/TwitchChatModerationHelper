[2022-12-21 15:40:58] <%rikkuster> it's weird because when Beatrix used it in your first fight against her in Burmecia it hits
[2022-12-21 15:40:58] <%Skyblueaqua> @Lonefellow it was only ever fixed by a mod on PC LUL
[2022-12-21 15:41:06] <+gemuotakuturner> its never been fixed in any re release.. it's the way the attack is coded, it's like a mis match of a gravity attack roll and normal attack. it uses its own accuracy rather than the accuracy of the weapon... the attacks accuracy is 0

[2022-12-21 16:27:24] <%Regasin> Also to lose an entire run, because you were off by a couple seconds. Would be awful
[2022-12-21 16:27:26] <%BerserkNow> excalibur 2 without fleeing would require save scumming segments and stuff
