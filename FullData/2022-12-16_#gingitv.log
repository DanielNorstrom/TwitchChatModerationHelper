[2022-12-16 00:15:06] <cokezero1337> they probably made this raid super easy so liquid can win :)

[2022-12-16 00:15:42] <Niquedouill> @Nanny the day ahead is largely irrelevant, getting the perfect gear is not though
[2022-12-16 00:15:44] <orrange7> Echo didnt start mythic raid or ?
[2022-12-16 00:15:47] <%+haawkel> or is it just for split?

[2022-12-16 00:16:27] <Niquedouill> @Nanny You get shit gear, no set bonuses or no weapons, you will progress slowlier..

[2022-12-16 00:18:04] <Niquedouill> @Nanny Good lord. The fact they get a head start is an advantage, but getting on top of that good gear drops means they're more likely to win the race. Don't be thick.

[2022-12-16 00:19:16] <%+PeterGolden12> Starting on HC splits first gives you less nm splits, so its an advantage for echo I think

[2022-12-16 00:19:29] <matesz33> I am a bit new to WoW,so can you guys tell me why its better to not start mythic yet?
[2022-12-16 00:19:32] <Niquedouill> @TodyrWow Yes... How does that detract from my point? When you get an extra raid day AND good loot drops, it means you are more likely to finish the raid than other guys.

[2022-12-16 00:20:48] <+B0bif> is it NM or HM ?
[2022-12-16 00:21:07] <+raxaas> @F1ipsydes yes
[2022-12-16 00:21:21] <+ELWOW> @F1ipsydes yes but not by echo
[2022-12-16 00:21:38] <Niquedouill> @Nanny It's really exceptions when the race is decided with a 10h gap. It usually boils down to gear and start. If you don't believe, check the difference between the first and second kill of last tiers. Usually the advantage Liquid get is either a) irrelevant because Liquid finishes way ahead or b) irrelevant since Echo wins the race
[2022-12-16 00:21:58] <hathrogue> How much more splits?
[2022-12-16 00:22:05] <matesz33> @iloveeggs  thank you so much my friend:)

[2022-12-16 00:23:08] <TodyrWow> @Niquedouill someone getting a head start in a race is always relevant, its not just about the finish. Its a marthon not a sprint. There's mental levels to it
[2022-12-16 00:23:42] <Nanny> just block that guy, he is just fuming for no reason

[2022-12-16 00:24:31] <%matto684> @Niquedouill i know you're trying to explain that the headstart isn't the deciding factor by pointing out other aspects that can be more important in who wins, but at the end of the day, having a day advantage is definitely a factor, and if u took two guilds with exactly the same gear, exactly the same skill & strats, the winning guild is the one who had an extra day
[2022-12-16 00:24:33] <TheErtan> Echo had to wake up at 4 in the morning with reset.

[2022-12-16 00:26:59] <+bigdoor89> must be bored of splits by now

[2022-12-16 00:28:10] <TodyrWow> idk why you're stressing, in BoD they woke up to Liquid being 6/8M  first day and still won
[2022-12-16 00:28:11] <imduncan> @Yelawtv Trust their work, u complaining wont help
[2022-12-16 00:28:13] <+s_thetic_steve> youre better off getting the most you can before going into mythic, echo will catch up fast. first half is irrelevant tbh, latter half is more important

[2022-12-16 00:28:28] <Niquedouill> @matto684 @matto684 Thank you, yes. But a factor we are also skipping is that it's mitigated by the first guild having to hash out the strat on more difficult bosses while the second guild can avoid the pitfalls and progress more rapidly. Say a 10h headstart can rapidly shrink due to the first guild making suboptimal decisions and the second guild building on a better strategy, learning from the first guild. Players at their level can capitalize quickly on that.
[2022-12-16 00:28:29] <%thetenderice> @Yelawtv liquid did splits all day yesterday aswell
[2022-12-16 00:28:34] <blastboys123> u know ppl have this conversation every time it is world first and also it seems like the guys who are actualyl in echo from what ive seen doesnt really say anything about it so i just think it is what it is
[2022-12-16 00:29:08] <+Gwedo18> is this a world first ? chat QQing back and forth about a day headstart.. unheard of !! hope you all have a good holiday season !

[2022-12-16 00:29:54] <%matto684> @Niquedouill ofcourse, like i said there are many factors to the whole race, but all in all i don't think a full day headstart is small enough to be shrugged off.

[2022-12-16 00:30:12] <%+DubTheSpencer> it is not THE factor but its still a factor, and one that u cant influence, but it is what it is and dont think blizz will change it

[2022-12-16 00:31:01] <%matto684> historically the extra day hasn't even proven to be a game changer anyway, eu guilds have frequently won the world first race, US guilds get up early, stall on later bosses, eu flies through

[2022-12-16 00:31:30] <bearfukuu> @matto684 castle nathria was all about the second reset, so not true
[2022-12-16 00:31:43] <+Coriollis> @certified86 yes because people are robots and don't sleep xD
[2022-12-16 00:31:45] <cha0tiic> guys, just watch the damn race
[2022-12-16 00:31:50] <certified86> @Niquedouill so is copying liquid's strats
[2022-12-16 00:31:51] <bobozchtek> Have echo only been doing splits? can't see any progress on mythic
[2022-12-16 00:31:54] <blastboys123> like europeans and na fans think the performance of who wins will reflect upon them as indivudual players like bro nah
[2022-12-16 00:31:59] <not_that_guy> @certified86 how is it 4 hours? KEKW when this team is going to sleep now and other woke up 4hours ago
[2022-12-16 00:32:01] <%matto684> @bearfukuu i said historically bro, like as in all raids ever to have been released and cleared, there are always a few loose exceptions
[2022-12-16 00:32:03] <%+DubTheSpencer> @certified86 its about 12-13 raw hours
[2022-12-16 00:32:05] <%palookh> @bobozchtek yes
[2022-12-16 00:32:10] <klenis> @Niquedouill Copying a strat and actually training the strat for hours ahead is a huge difference tho
[2022-12-16 00:32:13] <Koroth> anyone had killed mythic bosses yet?
[2022-12-16 00:32:17] <+Eastpasta> why echo still doing splits??

[2022-12-16 00:33:19] <%+DubTheSpencer> i just hope the bosses arent tuned so easy so echo can catch up and we can watch some racing
[2022-12-16 00:33:19] <+iD8vid> Liquid got 3 bosses down
[2022-12-16 00:33:23] <Nissou__> 4

[2022-12-16 00:33:29] <+iD8vid> Or 4
[2022-12-16 00:33:30] <klenis> @certified86 I dont see how you can not see that it IS an advantage in a race where you get a headstart? Its like letting a f1 driver drive a lap before you start, sure you can copy his strat but that still wont make you win because of the headstart
[2022-12-16 00:33:34] <Koroth> ty
[2022-12-16 00:33:50] <+kharzon> mythic is out?

[2022-12-16 00:34:39] <imduncan> @Yelawtv Cool story, now let them do their part and head to another stream if cant shut up about it
[2022-12-16 00:34:41] <Yelawtv> whatt then ????????

[2022-12-16 00:34:53] <Roo_1993> @Yelawtv its almost like theyre NA so ofcourse their splits wouldve been done first
[2022-12-16 00:34:55] <%palookh> Chatters who struggle to get AOTC surely know best
[2022-12-16 00:34:57] <Pilky02> @Yelawtv they will clear mythic very quickly once they have the items
[2022-12-16 00:34:58] <%Lataran> @Yelawtv is this the first race you watch?

[2022-12-16 00:35:19] <+jjustmitch1995> @yelawtv then echo wil be 6/8 in 6 hours from waking up lol
[2022-12-16 00:35:23] <Nissou__> i guess it does not matter how fast you kill the 6 first boss if you dont have enough ilvl for the last  you have to do split again
[2022-12-16 00:35:48] <+Reonan33> @GingiTV WTF WOW IS SAFED CHRIS IS BACK IN IT IM SO FKCING HYPED DOOOD
[2022-12-16 00:35:49] <Nissou__> as long as you clear the most before the reset

[2022-12-16 00:36:36] <Yelawtv> All im trying to say is , If echo wakes up liquid will be 6/8 and they will have a HUGE Adventage being Ahead :D cus that never happend before so far ahead :d  after all Echo are humans aswell and they can make Mistakes like everyone of us :)
[2022-12-16 00:36:40] <Nissou__> they could be right tho we dont know how hard is rasz myth

[2022-12-16 00:41:14] <userenfw> they are still 30 people lol
[2022-12-16 00:41:53] <+Jiblexic> Genuine question now, do we know the avg iLvl amongst the mains in Echo?
[2022-12-16 00:41:55] <+ELWOW> @klenis only echo keep running them, liquid for example did last boss HC and went into mythic
[2022-12-16 00:42:20] <Roo_1993> @Jiblexic I heard they havnt distributed any loot they got, not sure if thats still the case
[2022-12-16 00:42:21] <klenis> @klenis yeah because they are DONE with them, they already did them because they are ahead on time... because of when eu starts
[2022-12-16 00:42:35] <+Jiblexic> @Jiblexic I thought they were distributing earlier?

[2022-12-16 00:44:47] <klenis> @Roo_1993 They did way more and was running 2 teams at the same time
[2022-12-16 00:45:07] <+ELWOW> they ran 3 teams, stop just acting like you know anything already pls xD
[2022-12-16 00:45:11] <Roo_1993> @klenis I dont think liquid did more than 11 heroic splits lol
[2022-12-16 00:45:18] <+BrickedAsF> @Roo_1993 Liquid did 18 splits and ran 3 groups at once
[2022-12-16 00:45:23] <kongenforheved> Har i ikke travlt med at komme igang med mythic ??
[2022-12-16 00:45:30] <klenis> @Roo_1993 They each have 6 characters with 3 teams = 18 splits

[2022-12-16 00:45:58] <klenis> Yeah cause thats what we discussed in the first place

[2022-12-16 00:46:01] <+BrickedAsF> I know they did 18 normal splits with 3 groups at the same time but idk about heroic
[2022-12-16 00:46:08] <Roo_1993> no I was talking about heroic splits
[2022-12-16 00:46:15] <Roo_1993> echo did 11 heroic splits iirc
[2022-12-16 00:46:17] <+BrickedAsF> Heroic was probably 10-11 splits with 2 at the same time
[2022-12-16 00:46:20] <Roo_1993> what I heard on the mai nstream
[2022-12-16 00:46:32] <klenis> Why did you answer him then with 6 splits? we were talking about normals
[2022-12-16 00:46:49] <Roo_1993> huh
[2022-12-16 00:46:51] <%Ghergy> it doesn't matter, what matters is who kills the last boss
[2022-12-16 00:47:09] <klenis> 11* sorry confusing names and i am getting tired
[2022-12-16 00:47:35] <Roo_1993> @klenis for one I asked the question I didn't answer anyone, and no one was talking about normal when I asked the question in the first place

[2022-12-16 00:58:11] <Versiondk> @Odinslayer Plan is to maximize gear onto single mains so they can clear easier and not get stuck and potentially show strats that might fail for them cause lack of items
[2022-12-16 00:58:32] <Sir_Charley> @Odinslayer The plan is very simple, the race won't end today or tomorrow and being behind now doesn't matter at all if they can make up the difference in a few hours

[2022-12-16 20:06:24] <+SPICEaLIFE> from what I heard hunters are having a hard time with this fight do to lack of defensives

[2022-12-16 20:06:29] <%+RheiaOfTheNorth> @bananman9000 they are still distributing gear for their main raiders, not set in stone yet

[2022-12-16 20:10:22] <Exoduc> @alphadeity303 theyre gathering gear now so they wont have to once they begin mythic.. Smart when you think about it, getting all the intel from other raiders while giving no time for others to use theirs
[2022-12-16 20:10:23] <N0oah> Dude i imagine they have so much pent up energy to do the mythic push when they're done here. They'll be blasting through the first 4 bosses for sure

[2022-12-16 20:13:19] <Nanny> not gonna be able to compare ilvl until they are done with splits and 4/8 mythic
[2022-12-16 20:13:21] <Chetroki> @Bekant__ Echo with their 20 most geared ppl will be over 400 for sure
[2022-12-16 20:13:27] <ruivo_andre> @Bekant__ echo ill finish higher probably
[2022-12-16 20:13:27] <%bzk1_> how many world first does liquid have? Please tell me, I forgot
[2022-12-16 20:13:32] <murtokqt> @Bekant__ I think thats a reach tho no?
[2022-12-16 20:13:37] <N0oah> i think coming out of this they will avg. 402-404
[2022-12-16 20:13:51] <Fruze> @bzk1_ Pffft! They have.... And ermh.... Also To mention they have...
[2022-12-16 20:13:57] <murtokqt> @Bekant__ They have jsut couple close 400 atm, surely people wont get near 10ivl from this 1 bos

[2022-12-16 20:15:09] <Chetroki> Idk how u calculate Echo's avg ilvl when they dont even know which chars are bringing in...
[2022-12-16 20:15:26] <murtokqt> @Chetroki They have handed some or even most loot out tho
[2022-12-16 20:15:37] <epicstv_> i was here
[2022-12-16 20:15:47] <+Helzer13> not sure the amount of heroic razy kills is relevant, for example Liquid may have only needed to do 6 to get the gear they wanted...is Echo still trying to get bows and tier helms?
[2022-12-16 20:15:52] <xSayez93> @xSayez93 ty
[2022-12-16 20:15:53] <Fruze> @Chetroki Pretty sure Scripe has it covered all down somehow, the guys a genious
[2022-12-16 20:15:54] <N0oah> well you can guess from limits ilvl and look at echos strat and see that they will land significantly higher with this setup

[2022-12-16 20:16:15] <Chetroki> @murtokqt But still they will bring the 20 most geared of all of the 9 splits so
[2022-12-16 20:16:42] <murtokqt> @Chetroki Ofc, but Ilvl they can gain anymore is this boss and normal loot imo
[2022-12-16 20:16:48] <+bananman9000> fast dinner break monkaHmm
[2022-12-16 20:17:04] <+wozzy038> They will gear far more then 20, more like 30 or even more
[2022-12-16 20:17:08] <+gerdesgubbel> When do you start with mythic?
[2022-12-16 20:17:20] <N0oah> @Chetroki Preach said that they have over 300 pieces of gear ready to be handed out - now obv. they wont all be able to go to the core team but still impressive
[2022-12-16 20:17:26] <Fruze> @gerdesgubbel after 2 more splits

[2022-12-16 20:34:50] <%+killfrenzyyy> Did he get helm?
[2022-12-16 20:34:53] <askisch> is this a myth?
[2022-12-16 20:34:54] <Nanny> no
[2022-12-16 20:34:55] <%+shorty8435> nope
[2022-12-16 20:34:55] <flippityfiloppity> are they still 0/8?
[2022-12-16 20:34:57] <murtokqt> @killfrenzyyy No
[2022-12-16 20:34:58] <flippityfiloppity> Mythic
[2022-12-16 20:34:59] <doobyr> lfr split after this?
[2022-12-16 20:35:03] <Spark026> i think he had 4 set on Gingipumper, but Gingidrei has more herioc items; i think its between those two depending on what they decide; but he did not get lucky on drei in Group 6 of Rhaz
[2022-12-16 20:35:06] <%+shorty8435> yeah lfr next
[2022-12-16 20:35:10] <haziee> they might do mythic + after his
[2022-12-16 20:35:17] <Sworn070> why no mythic ?
[2022-12-16 20:35:20] <xkillergod> @doobyr mythic splits 8 x 3/8 mythic splits bra
[2022-12-16 20:35:25] <rubberduckburg> did liquid do as many 8/8 splits?
[2022-12-16 20:35:27] <rubberduckburg> on hc
[2022-12-16 20:35:36] <blademasto> no mythic today
[2022-12-16 20:35:44] <askisch> is this myth?
[2022-12-16 20:35:44] <murtokqt> @rubberduckburg 2 less
[2022-12-16 20:35:46] <askisch> or hc?
[2022-12-16 20:35:51] <+Xoomer__> nice push
[2022-12-16 20:35:54] <haziee> hc
[2022-12-16 20:36:05] <Blizzard_Ent> fall down damage KEKW
[2022-12-16 20:36:05] <Nanny> after this they have to distribute all the gear aswell
[2022-12-16 20:36:06] <haziee> farming gear to get an ilvl advantafe
[2022-12-16 20:36:09] <shalomski> 3 less on last boss @murtokqt
[2022-12-16 20:36:11] <TheRealFaithLezz> @askisch It says Eranog Mythic not pulled on screen
[2022-12-16 20:36:26] <%+Cordassiuss> did liquid go back to hc after 4th kill?
[2022-12-16 20:36:28] <rubberduckburg> aa they are little better prepared then for mythic
[2022-12-16 20:36:31] <+kingjudethe1st> Do we know when they gonna start mythic yet or gonna start once everyone is geared?
[2022-12-16 20:36:33] <murtokqt> @shalomski Oh thought this is 8th and not 9th hc
[2022-12-16 20:36:35] <haziee> they might aswell do splits on mythic aswell if they anticipate it takes 1 reset
[2022-12-16 20:36:36] <rubberduckburg> but depends on drops
[2022-12-16 20:36:41] <+Gullfoss> WHAT IS LIQUID ILVL VS ECHO?
[2022-12-16 20:36:45] <haziee> just saying...

[2022-12-16 20:36:54] <haziee> liquid is about 399
[2022-12-16 20:37:03] <haziee> sidste run

[2022-12-16 20:37:14] <tyazzo> Pog that timing
[2022-12-16 20:37:25] <Coceandpopcorn> echo will smurf the first 3 bosses in mythic
[2022-12-16 20:37:28] <lastinferno1985> @haziee 399 with mythic pieces :)
[2022-12-16 20:37:30] <medi1> liquid is already at 4/8, you have no chance on WF :(

[2022-12-16 20:38:05] <+sweatyogre> @medi1 4/8 is like 10% of the pulls of the raid, progress is not linear
[2022-12-16 20:38:06] <haziee> @ayomus yes I know but let's say 6th boss is a halondrus and takes entire reset. you would rather do 2 splits on mythic and then next reset merge into 1 pump group
[2022-12-16 20:38:10] <abbapete1> kom så danmark!!! <3

[2022-12-16 20:38:56] <%ayomus> @haziee first 2 mythic runs decide what characters you have so you drag it out as much as possible

[2022-12-16 20:39:35] <Grottig_87> PepoPopcorn
[2022-12-16 20:39:41] <haziee> @ayomus if you run 10 main Chars with 10 alts and give 10 main chars the loot. then next reset you have a group with 20 people that got extra mythic gear
[2022-12-16 20:39:44] <+Frosty_Evades> inb4 more m+ before crafting then finally mythic
[2022-12-16 20:40:22] <+Isarees> how many splits left?

[2022-12-16 20:40:25] <haziee> @ayomus you are quite dense if you don't understand this is the exact thing they are doing on hc and Normal. just saying if boss 7 is a wall they can do it

[2022-12-16 21:02:32] <+재치있는 (feanor952)> wait this will be his main mage cuz 4 set? gingi drei reroll?
[2022-12-16 21:02:38] <+Zenrixx> I mean u guys wanted mythic right ? YEPPERS
[2022-12-16 21:02:43] <%+ashesk1> Which will be the main chracter
[2022-12-16 21:02:55] <joneshyped> why are u not mythic raiding  ?

[2022-12-16 21:03:17] <%+shorty8435> dumb questions in here

[2022-12-16 21:03:42] <+Xoomer__> Yeah if they were ready they would be in Mythic easy as that
[2022-12-16 21:03:51] <+Bpot> u guys giving out gear after M+?
[2022-12-16 21:03:54] <Lexrk> Gingipumper got 5-set, Gingidrei only 3-set, so rerolling Sadge

[2022-12-16 21:04:03] <medi1> RWF is getting worse and worse year by year with this stupid 100 HC and mythic+ splits for several days XDDD cringe
[2022-12-16 21:04:04] <murtokqt> now*
[2022-12-16 21:04:08] <+Bpot> @official_gino they havent given out any loot from any splits
[2022-12-16 21:04:09] <Cantbstopped91> why they so far behind liquid in splits?
[2022-12-16 21:04:10] <%Uguntinsh> @gingitv just at ruby skip first mob with rogue stealth
[2022-12-16 21:04:16] <murtokqt> @official_gino They have tho
[2022-12-16 21:04:20] <+Cosack135> @official_gino not true, lots of splits have just not ALL
[2022-12-16 21:04:28] <blizzardpolice69> prayge
[2022-12-16 21:04:29] <Mafinor> because liquid didn't do 9 of em
[2022-12-16 21:04:31] <blizzardpolice69> for the loots
[2022-12-16 21:04:33] <MuchFantasyVeryNameAmaze> Anyone know what the inspect/char panel addon is? The one that shows ilvl n enchants etc
[2022-12-16 21:04:34] <dixine> did he say this is 5 set?
[2022-12-16 21:04:34] <shalomski> @cantbstopped91 they done more splits
[2022-12-16 21:04:36] <Brainlesss93> its risky to hope that liquid havent the gear to clear the raid before they even start
[2022-12-16 21:04:38] <+nazarenee> @Cantbstopped91 they're ahead in splits.
[2022-12-16 21:04:42] <Joniio> have they killed the dragon 9 times?
[2022-12-16 21:04:44] <%+damale> when you lads raiding mythic
[2022-12-16 21:04:46] <murtokqt> @dixine If they decide to funnel all set to him
[2022-12-16 21:04:47] <+nazarenee> @Brainlesss93 agreed

[2022-12-16 21:05:01] <%+shorty8435> @Brainlesss93 that aint going to beat the raid before they start.. theyve already hit a wall on the 5th boss
[2022-12-16 21:05:02] <blizzardpolice69> @재치있는 sup bestfriend
[2022-12-16 21:05:04] <shalomski> they cleared hc 9 times

[2022-12-16 21:06:10] <shalomski> liquid were struggling on 5th boss, deffo seems a gear check

[2022-12-16 21:06:28] <%+Thoreya> i mean they got it to 30% then went to bed
[2022-12-16 21:06:29] <baitplayer> hey gingi, with as many addons as possible you won't get the "lua error" message on your screen?
[2022-12-16 21:06:30] <%+Thoreya> and are now doing it again
[2022-12-16 21:06:33] <%+Thoreya> idk if its a wall
[2022-12-16 21:06:41] <murtokqt> @shalomski 30ish pulls, 40%, sounds more like a better approach can squish that, not rly gear diff since they are 400+ already
[2022-12-16 21:06:42] <dixine> @shalomski that one is more tactic, but 8+9th requires gear.
[2022-12-16 21:06:44] <%falxie> What a legend that guy listing shit
[2022-12-16 21:06:47] <+Bazzzel> Gingipumper is the new main?
[2022-12-16 21:06:50] <%+Thoreya> if it was a wall theyd be gearing still
[2022-12-16 21:06:50] <%+shorty8435> 26 pulls and they got it down to 43% @Thoreya
[2022-12-16 21:06:56] <snorrow92> @Bazzzel yep
[2022-12-16 21:07:01] <lanadel6> gingo gettin fed gear like a grilled pork :))

[2022-12-16 21:08:17] <+Bazzzel> I guess a tier piece
[2022-12-16 21:08:21] <BadNewsCommin> @nazarenee pumper in his name
[2022-12-16 21:08:23] <dixine> @nazarenee pumper in the name
[2022-12-16 21:08:26] <%+shorty8435> 4 set
[2022-12-16 21:08:31] <BadNewsCommin> @dixine o/ great minds think alike
[2022-12-16 21:08:38] <+nazarenee> But isnt he getting 4 set traded to him after dungeon on gingipumper?
[2022-12-16 21:08:40] <+ForeverOflu> do u getting 4 set?
[2022-12-16 21:08:41] <shalomski> liquid only did 6 hc clears on last 3 bosses vs echo 9
[2022-12-16 21:08:51] <dixine> @BadNewsCommin they sure do.. you want to be assistant to the regional manager?
[2022-12-16 21:09:02] <Mafinor> @GingiTV GET THE LOOT FIRST SwiftRage

[2022-12-16 21:09:10] <+Bazzzel> Can you split mythic bosses? Or do u get locked
[2022-12-16 21:09:17] <%+shorty8435> locked
[2022-12-16 21:09:19] <+Zenrixx> Echo currently has a pretty big item lead
[2022-12-16 21:09:25] <murtokqt> @Zenrixx Not true hto
[2022-12-16 21:09:33] <%+KASKARGO> @Zenrixx yes it is
[2022-12-16 21:09:34] <king_rallod> what is your average ilvl after splits?
[2022-12-16 21:09:34] <blizzardpolice69> @nazarenee my guess is that they did splits
[2022-12-16 21:09:36] <%+Thoreya> liquid has a bunch of loot that they havent distributed
[2022-12-16 21:09:38] <%+Thoreya> yet
[2022-12-16 21:09:39] <blizzardpolice69> and he got no tier set
[2022-12-16 21:09:45] <shalomski> didn't they just say 1 of there guys at 410 now lol?
[2022-12-16 21:09:48] <blizzardpolice69> on his mage run

[2022-12-16 21:09:52] <+Zenrixx> @Thoreya Still Echo did way more splits = more loot

[2022-12-16 21:10:50] <blizzardpolice69> @zrank_fappa Basically there's two competitions going on once with the win condition being killing the last boss. But echo is basically buying extra guns before they fight
[2022-12-16 21:11:06] <blizzardpolice69> gear competition and boss

[2022-12-16 21:11:56] <%+RheiaOfTheNorth> limit is also grinding m+, so limit is looking to make up for the gear they didnt get with this distribution that echo does in m+ it seems
[2022-12-16 21:11:58] <KiwiGuy17> Pulling too much lol :P
[2022-12-16 21:12:05] <shalomski> echo will prob do 1st 3 mythic tonight as fairly easy, maybe 4th if start early enough
[2022-12-16 21:12:19] <lanludar> Limit is in mythic now
[2022-12-16 21:12:24] <%+RheiaOfTheNorth> they back in mythic?
[2022-12-16 21:12:27] <+cettcsgo> is Gingipumper his main char?
[2022-12-16 21:12:27] <murtokqt> @shalomski Prolly takes 1-2h to give all loot
[2022-12-16 21:12:30] <%+RheiaOfTheNorth> got enough gear i guess?
[2022-12-16 21:12:31] <lanludar> yup
[2022-12-16 21:12:32] <%+Jiblexic> Have they distributed her?
[2022-12-16 21:12:36] <%+Jiblexic> Yet
[2022-12-16 21:12:42] <blizzardpolice69> Limit is gearing as they go, i think Echo plans on gearing then going as far they can before the next reset
[2022-12-16 21:12:44] <%+Captain_Bayne> this key tough man
[2022-12-16 21:12:55] <blizzardpolice69> after they gear up
[2022-12-16 21:12:58] <%+RheiaOfTheNorth> doing it now @Jiblexic, it seems, then filling with m+ for rest of day
[2022-12-16 21:12:58] <blizzardpolice69> so they can machine gun pull
[2022-12-16 21:12:59] <+Xoomer__> @blizzardpolice69 yeah seems so
[2022-12-16 21:13:01] <murtokqt> @blizzardpolice69 Chance we dont see next reset race
[2022-12-16 21:13:08] <shalomski> yh loot distribution will take time hence they doing m+ to kill time and side upgrades
[2022-12-16 21:13:08] <lanludar> Don't know if they distributed yet
[2022-12-16 21:13:21] <Nicoulaws> Bonsoir, quelqu’un peut me dire pourquoi ils sont pas en mythic ?
[2022-12-16 21:13:29] <blizzardpolice69> @murtokqt My guess it'll be with the tuning we've seen so far but we could be wrong

[2022-12-16 21:14:08] <%+RheiaOfTheNorth> they think raz will be a though gearcheck right?
[2022-12-16 21:14:08] <Helinum> why are you not pulling the raid
[2022-12-16 21:14:10] <%PatrickDJ1994> They need something out of M+ before they wanna go Mythic
[2022-12-16 21:14:16] <TheRealFaithLezz> @Manwed Fun content right DansGame
[2022-12-16 21:14:17] <Blue4Fire> M+ SINCE BIG HEAD ARE PLANING
[2022-12-16 21:14:19] <+seamuscg> ok so now that heroic splits are done how many m+ we doing
[2022-12-16 21:14:21] <%+KASKARGO> @Nicoulaws Ils font du mm+ pour unlock les craft et avoir une piece de gear mm+upgrade avec le rating
[2022-12-16 21:14:30] <TheRealFaithLezz> If it didnt say RWF nobody knew they were even racing KEKW
[2022-12-16 21:14:47] <darksmectaz> @Nicoulaws  ils se gearent au maximum je pense pour pouvoir rouler sur le mythique, mais bon j'y comprends pas trop non plus car liquid sont bientot a 5/8
[2022-12-16 21:14:49] <jabbarri> I get why they are doing it but its not good entertainment. RWF is dead in this format of all together
[2022-12-16 21:15:01] <gary9496> they pull mythic soon
[2022-12-16 21:15:01] <lanludar> racing is doing some heavy lifting right now
[2022-12-16 21:15:07] <global_klashinkov> how is havoc dh in m+
[2022-12-16 21:15:07] <TheRealFaithLezz> RWF doesnt exist
[2022-12-16 21:15:19] <blizzardpolice69> the only really way to change the split format
[2022-12-16 21:15:20] <%+RheiaOfTheNorth> this is usually the week before mythic raid pressed into 3 days @jabbarri
[2022-12-16 21:15:26] <blizzardpolice69> would be getting rid of gear lol
[2022-12-16 21:15:29] <themaliciousrabbit> Imagine thinking RWF is dead just because guilds aren't rushing mythic day one
[2022-12-16 21:15:30] <blizzardpolice69> or having a guild lockout
[2022-12-16 21:15:32] <darksmectaz> @KASKARGO ok mais liquid l'ont fait ou pas ? Car ils tombent du boss at
[2022-12-16 21:15:34] <darksmectaz> m
[2022-12-16 21:15:40] <Nicoulaws> Merci pour vos réponses. Effectivement, bizarre comme choix
[2022-12-16 21:15:44] <themaliciousrabbit> This isn't classic where the raids are speedran and cleared 45 mins after release
[2022-12-16 21:15:47] <the_qwerto> omg they doing m+ wtf
[2022-12-16 21:15:47] <Baserac> stop the blame tbh, when they start pumping they wont leave it. And no one will remember those m+s
[2022-12-16 21:15:47] <Nicoulaws> On verra à la fin si ça paye
[2022-12-16 21:15:48] <+Zenrixx> This RWF is way less entertaining for most people because they released all difficulties at the same time, normally guilds have almost enough time to fully gear out before mythic drops which is gone this time
[2022-12-16 21:15:51] <Rosharr> What is your Rio atm Mike
[2022-12-16 21:15:54] <maawho> Chatting
[2022-12-16 21:16:03] <%PatrickDJ1994> This is the 1st time that Mythic released Week 1 of the raid generally we have a week of Heroic and THEN mythic so its a bit differend then usual.. so keep that in mind chat
[2022-12-16 21:16:04] <+Rezzfull> @themaliciousrabbit It's bad for viewership. Mythic on week 2 was extremely hype because you knew when the teams were actually going to do mythic
[2022-12-16 21:16:09] <Nanny> yeah people just forgot about the fact that it used to be 1 week between heroic and mythic release lmfao
[2022-12-16 21:16:34] <themaliciousrabbit> @Rezzfull Alright and what about when they all just went to do m+ and heroic splits half way through the race because they needed gear?
[2022-12-16 21:16:37] <matotheace> then just dont watch first few days ICANT
[2022-12-16 21:16:58] <+Xoomer__> i like it that they release it all at same time makes it more of a race
[2022-12-16 21:16:58] <+Rezzfull> @themaliciousrabbit That was obvious when they hit a wall, but Echo hasn't even attempted mythic lol
[2022-12-16 21:17:12] <%+KASKARGO> @darksmectaz Liquid ont fait moins de splits et d'après moi ils ont moins de gear, raz va demander un dps check élevé donc c'est plausible, et liquid tombera pas le raid cette nuit donc bon
[2022-12-16 21:17:18] <jabbarri> @RheiaOfTheNorth I get that but we want to see race to world first. 3 days of prep isn't good for viewers
[2022-12-16 21:17:26] <ReuvenGT> Arcane mage yikes
[2022-12-16 21:17:30] <+Xoomer__> but i can see how some can get unlucky gearwise though
[2022-12-16 21:17:30] <CatakidWoW> what will happen to MM now after changes?
[2022-12-16 21:17:42] <%+shorty8435> @jabbarri don’t watch the prep then 😂
[2022-12-16 21:17:44] <matotheace> u guys realize echo can kill 4 bosses in like 3-4 hours?
[2022-12-16 21:17:46] <%+FozzyTV> I Love the prep
[2022-12-16 21:17:49] <matotheace> 4/8 means nothing
[2022-12-16 21:17:53] <kwlski01> @ReuvenGT eheh
[2022-12-16 21:17:53] <snorrow92> @jabbarri prep and splits has always been a thing in RWF, even in mythic weeks
[2022-12-16 21:17:57] <+sora_wow1> all die kinder peepoLove
[2022-12-16 21:18:03] <%+FozzyTV> You can learn a lot about the game from those preps
[2022-12-16 21:18:06] <%Thomasa123> @CatakidWoW Its still good, not really a nerf
[2022-12-16 21:18:07] <cidoywow> Is this gingis main?
[2022-12-16 21:18:09] <%+shorty8435> Blizzard didn’t release it to cater for RWF
[2022-12-16 21:18:10] <shalomski> mm still very strong, especially aoe grped fights
[2022-12-16 21:18:21] <Blue4Fire> @cidoywow yeah but without gear
[2022-12-16 21:18:24] <+Rezzfull> Whats lame is that the 5th boss looks strong but killable, but no one is attempting
[2022-12-16 21:18:26] <Cantbstopped91> are they way behind liquid? why havnt they started mythic yet?
[2022-12-16 21:18:27] <M0ustacho> When wil Echo start on the mythic progress?
[2022-12-16 21:18:29] <asennaoenn> Before prep was for one full week, now it is 2-3 days, cant sse the problem?
[2022-12-16 21:18:37] <grixtwtch> what ilvl they farming?

[2022-12-16 21:20:43] <jabbarri> @snorrow92 I never said it hasn't but the spectacle of RWL has diminished with the release of all the ways to get gear simultaneously
[2022-12-16 21:20:54] <blizzardpolice69> @Hug_The_Tree It's the skill curve increase that all games have
[2022-12-16 21:20:56] <%+KASKARGO> @Diggodyr it's 18 and they barely have any gear

[2022-12-16 21:23:02] <Syryin> last RWF was a constant battle back n forth on bosses. this one is just turning into a dungeon crawl before finally facerolling every boss in myth

[2022-12-16 21:23:40] <snorrow92> @jabbarri yeah, would be nice to have a tourny realm with same release times world wide and characters with base item gear without ways to upgrade other than mythic bosses
[2022-12-16 21:23:42] <blizzardpolice69> @mcrelaxoqz he got no tier in his split
[2022-12-16 21:23:45] <themaliciousrabbit> @mcrelaxoqz he can't get 4set on gingidrei
[2022-12-16 21:23:46] <matotheace> @Syryin no it was not. last race limit was also ahead by alot and all bosses till crab were basically 1shot

[2022-12-16 21:24:01] <themaliciousrabbit> @mcrelaxoqz he's getting 5 piece tier, weapon, offhand, more loot and maybe trinkets on this mage
[2022-12-16 21:24:02] <Rosharr> Maybe he is main mage this expansion
[2022-12-16 21:24:03] <%mcrelaxoqz> ah good to know thx
[2022-12-16 21:24:04] <lofvet> I think one bad thing with releasing all difficulties at the same time is that there's so much gear to farm that this scenario happens. Echo can keep farming gear when they see that Liquid are stuck on bosses, no need to go and push mythic while Liquid is streaming their tactics/tries
[2022-12-16 21:24:12] <haziee> @blue4fire how? all hc are done on that char

[2022-12-16 21:42:15] <%PatrickDJ1994> @Diggodyr because he was gearing multiple characters and depending on the gear those Characters got would decide what his main would be

[2022-12-16 21:43:02] <blizzardpolice69> because he didn't get 4 set from the splits he did @MadCozBanned

[2022-12-16 21:43:16] <blizzardpolice69> so he has to use an account that he did get it with

[2022-12-16 21:43:55] <themaliciousrabbit> So it's the mage that has the most eligible loot.

[2022-12-16 21:44:03] <blizzardpolice69> I feel bad for the healer not because he's bad but because he has to learn this bullshit lool

[2022-12-16 21:45:31] <blizzardpolice69> and gingi is playing well, using his defensives really well
[2022-12-16 21:45:44] <+Zyttorin> mythic tonight or tomorrow morning instead?

[2022-12-16 22:10:12] <icebreakerssss> Yea I just meant like forcing the 18, instead of running the 17 or even running two 15 keys in this amount of time. just feels weird that an 18 would be worth over an hours time
[2022-12-16 22:10:18] <+reffefyren> @mazerko_ yea its actually depressing
[2022-12-16 22:10:47] <+Xoomer__> @mazerko_ always the same every RWF
[2022-12-16 22:10:51] <Nanny> its because they need a 17 on gingi since he doesnt have key, he had to swap mains after not getting 4 set @icebreakerssss

[2022-12-16 22:23:32] <Sir_Charley> @murtokqt Not really when 4 bosses are pretty much free, just a matter of time management
[2022-12-16 22:23:36] <Zefixa> When do you start with mythic?
[2022-12-16 22:23:38] <Chetroki> @drbagos Thee maybe are, but they want to get the best possible gear before jumping into Mythic
[2022-12-16 22:23:55] <drbagos> i understand they are necessary, i'm saying i wish they weren't.
[2022-12-16 22:24:06] <+LIZARD_Monukuma> nice Transmog btw Kapp

[2022-12-16 22:24:11] <murtokqt> @murtokqt Well it took other guild 10+h to clear, still takes echo half a day to catch and then start to prog, and ofc liguid will see 5/8 forsure
[2022-12-16 22:24:29] <+dennisbooker> But what if..if you dont need this massive Gear? And some dudes with less Gear will win

[2022-12-16 22:24:59] <Fyfan> @dennisbooker it is what it is then
[2022-12-16 22:25:00] <+TheZunzeT> theres no shot you go 8/8 with 397 ilvl
[2022-12-16 22:25:13] <darksmectaz> @dennisbooker razga will be impossible with low gear
[2022-12-16 22:25:21] <+goosh780> they just buffed the last 2 bosses on mythic. which means they did that because they're going into it overgeared imo
[2022-12-16 22:25:31] <Fyfan> but after boss buffs its highly unlikely that the bosses will be killed with low ilvl
[2022-12-16 22:25:33] <nuclearpistachios> @GingiTV dont u need ring from gb?
[2022-12-16 22:25:33] <Sir_Charley> @dennisbooker If boss 5 is a wall for liquid, you're guaranteed no random guild will out of nowhere go 8/8
[2022-12-16 22:25:39] <%+n0tDef1ned> wait how do u become a tuskarr??
[2022-12-16 22:25:39] <kappa288> @dennisbooker that's why atm only liquid is 4/8 and the next guild is 2/8. so yeah, you need gear
[2022-12-16 22:25:40] <+dennisbooker> @Fyfan  that my line ^^ in Germany.. " Es ist, was es ist"..

[2022-12-16 22:30:01] <murtokqt> @Fyfan I mean yes, but meant that some people had last boss to decide you reroll or stick to that toon, example now this mage has just 1 key done which is unfortunate

[2022-12-16 22:50:50] <thekinger55> @cello_73 might I ask why? I thinknliquids on day 2 of mythic. are they focusing heavier on gearing and splits?
[2022-12-16 22:51:08] <casioitsnotme> obviously
[2022-12-16 22:51:19] <%Cello_73> @thekinger55 correct, focused on gearing and the 1st 4 bosses are easy so they should be able to catch up
[2022-12-16 22:51:22] <themaliciousrabbit> Scuffed opener Sadge
[2022-12-16 22:51:23] <+rubyspark> 83,7% before last 4 :D
[2022-12-16 22:51:38] <Sir_Charley> @Mattasaurusx I'm pretty sure strat changed after seeing liquid struggle on 5th boss
[2022-12-16 22:51:52] <thekinger55> makes sense. just has me curious now why NA so confident to not focus as hard on gearing
[2022-12-16 22:52:01] <+lysteria65> why kite into the cave?

[2022-12-16 22:52:22] <%Cello_73> @thekinger55 they kinda did as well honestly but think they may have had better luck at first with drops. Truly though, I am not sure
[2022-12-16 22:52:39] <+mmathiaspre> @thekinger55 Usually HC and Mythic are not released at the same time. Now it is and I think NA believes they can just steamroll through mythic
[2022-12-16 22:52:53] <%Cello_73> not sure that is true
[2022-12-16 22:53:01] <%Cello_73> they did 9 splits as well

[2022-12-16 22:55:29] <%+Nasuria22> @bestmageuniverse wow your opinion is settled on one endbossfight that took alot of energy
[2022-12-16 22:55:31] <%Cello_73> @bestmageuniverse you also see ppl work on their weaknesses to get stronger. To have the mentality that will always be the case is dangerous
[2022-12-16 22:55:37] <+snyth1994> do u think mage or wl are stronger for m+?

[2022-12-16 22:56:21] <+bestmageuniverse> I am not saying Liquid are bad, just they are not on same level as Echo. That's a fact. Again, not being rude or anything.
[2022-12-16 22:56:24] <+Earendil2021> Do they gonna start mythic raid today ?

[2022-12-16 22:57:32] <Sir_Charley> @Cello_73 but not in the same order and did not save loot...they equipped 4 pieces before maximizing ilvl, I'm pretty sure Echo will have a few ilvl more
[2022-12-16 22:57:33] <dumbledotz> Have Echo farmed all items in WoW or are they still farming?

[2022-12-16 22:59:15] <%pew2700> Really bold strategy for them to not do any mythic today...
[2022-12-16 22:59:26] <%Fricko1> @Perolex1 The lock is Ravedisco
[2022-12-16 22:59:39] <klenis> @pew2700 says who tho?
[2022-12-16 22:59:41] <snorrow92> @pew2700 not that bold, liquid is hitting a wall
[2022-12-16 22:59:50] <+mmathiaspre> is gingidrei the main of gingi now=
[2022-12-16 22:59:50] <Witchbladelol> Why havent they started mythic yet?
[2022-12-16 22:59:52] <+mmathiaspre> ?
[2022-12-16 22:59:56] <kwlski01> 25 rog no?
[2022-12-16 23:00:01] <snorrow92> @mmathiaspre no, gingipumper is
[2022-12-16 23:00:02] <+Coffly> Hat Echo schon mit Mythic progress angefangen oder heute noch nicht ?
[2022-12-16 23:00:13] <Versiondk> @pew2700 I think the Raz HC clear took a little longer than anticipated but they decided to stick with it cause the gear upgrades are needed in the long run
[2022-12-16 23:00:20] <+mmathiaspre> @snorrow92 but online it says that gingidrei has higher ilvl so I am confused
[2022-12-16 23:00:24] <%+killfrenzyyy> @Coffly nein
[2022-12-16 23:00:30] <%bzk1_> gindrei is higher ilvl
[2022-12-16 23:00:39] <%bzk1_> but doesnt have 4 pieces set
[2022-12-16 23:00:43] <klenis> higher ilvl doesnt necessary mean better gear
[2022-12-16 23:00:49] <snorrow92> @mmathiaspre gingidrei doesnth ave 4 set
[2022-12-16 23:00:52] <%bzk1_> tihs char hasnt done mythics
[2022-12-16 23:00:57] <%bzk1_> started right now
[2022-12-16 23:01:06] <+mmathiaspre> aah, I understand. Thank you
[2022-12-16 23:01:19] <%bzk1_> gingidrei done around 9 runs
[2022-12-16 23:01:25] <%bzk1_> also crafted items
[2022-12-16 23:01:28] <Sir_Charley> @mmathiaspre I think it's one of his options...they did not do all those splits to not have a second option, but yes seems drei will be his main
[2022-12-16 23:01:46] <corzy99> that frostbolt minmax tho
[2022-12-16 23:02:12] <%+Slicedbacon> rip surprise new main for perfecto
[2022-12-16 23:02:13] <snorrow92> @Sir_Charley drei wont be his main
[2022-12-16 23:02:26] <itsrichardsz> @sir_charley  this will be his main due to tier set
[2022-12-16 23:02:28] <+unluckygamingtwitch> what will be gingis main
[2022-12-16 23:02:37] <matanaist> Oh yeah just order 4 ELX tubes cant wait to try new flavours

[2022-12-16 23:02:52] <Sir_Charley> @snorrow92 which one will be then? not trolling or sarcastic

[2022-12-16 23:11:09] <TheHolyPuppy> it doesn't matter how many kills liquid have - the only boss who is important is the last boss and they need way more gear for it
[2022-12-16 23:11:11] <Kaevlike> @thelion2211 the last ones are the hard ones though

[2022-12-16 23:11:21] <Lidlistfake> lets fucking goooo
[2022-12-16 23:11:24] <Versiondk> @thelion2211 first 5 bosses are about 15-20% of the entire raid pulls if not less
[2022-12-16 23:11:26] <+sora_wow1> perfecto tired cuz no elx ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper
[2022-12-16 23:11:26] <TheHolyPuppy> and they wont kill him this week so bith guilds can take their time
[2022-12-16 23:11:33] <lakers2324> Pog mythic today?
[2022-12-16 23:11:36] <+Frosty_Evades> damn even im 391 and no one is funneling me gear. That seems really unlucky
[2022-12-16 23:11:48] <thelion2211> @Versiondk well they keep getting progress and learning the fights
[2022-12-16 23:11:54] <+pomi2137> yea, im 390 and i wasnt in the raid at all
[2022-12-16 23:11:57] <+Flawer4000> Frost mage1 round?
[2022-12-16 23:12:12] <Torp98> @pomi2137 So how much tier set do you have? =)
[2022-12-16 23:12:18] <%whtshdow> could he get the 4 tier?
[2022-12-16 23:12:33] <+pomi2137> @pomi2137 still, with all the resources they have it seems low?

[2022-12-16 23:13:31] <Versiondk> @thelion2211 yeah? so? they just need to kill each boss 1 time before reset and 1 more time again next reset (if they get there) so having more pulls on bosses that will be easy with better gear don't really matter
[2022-12-16 23:13:43] <+Aneas> Whats Mikes ilvl?

[2022-12-16 23:14:27] <+seamuscg> @murtokqt if they are all oneshots like liquid maybe they get motivated lol

[2022-12-16 23:16:53] <%Velzen__> cool
[2022-12-16 23:17:21] <MRNiFF> As a liquid fan I really hope this heats up. The race just isn’t the same when there’s no competition. I’m rooting for liquid but I hope for the races sake it comes down to the wire and isn’t just a shutout.
[2022-12-16 23:17:45] <Nanny> should be fine since liquid has hit a wall @MRNiFF
[2022-12-16 23:17:47] <%Velzen__> liquid is#3 world

[2022-12-16 23:18:04] <+pomi2137> yea, it's wa
[2022-12-16 23:18:05] <Versiondk> @MRNiFF Don't worry the gap will close soon - But yeah this much time spend without mythic progress is a little sad
[2022-12-16 23:18:07] <foxyca> @mrniff same! I enjoy watching both but rooting for echo a bit more hehe! but love the race being close for sure
[2022-12-16 23:18:30] <%Velzen__> Liquid has a chance to become #2 this time though
[2022-12-16 23:18:38] <Nanny> the issue is blizz not separating release for mythic and hc this time tbh
[2022-12-16 23:18:42] <%Velzen__> Echo #1 and probably Liquid or BDGG #2
[2022-12-16 23:18:45] <foxyca> @velzen__ which is #1 now?
[2022-12-16 23:18:45] <+Zenrixx> @Versiondk Thats what happens when blizzard releases all difficulties at once ... usually we had 1 week heroic and then mythic but now its all clusterd up KEKW
[2022-12-16 23:18:51] <foxyca> ah i see
[2022-12-16 23:18:57] <MRNiFF> @foxyca That’s what I’m saying. I love Echo also but can’t have the top two both be my picks. 😂
[2022-12-16 23:19:04] <%Velzen__> Echo has won last 2 races

[2022-12-16 23:20:32] <Donvigoo> usually the guilds need first week to gear up, then hit some kind of wall in mythic, begin doing hc splits...so if they manage to clear all Bosses this first week, it feels kinds undertuned
[2022-12-16 23:20:39] <foxyca> will be a great show for sure

[2022-12-16 23:23:41] <Versiondk> @JeevesFPS I haven't seen a tier list, sorry but again it depends on if you're talking about m+, raiding and if you really wanna tryhard it comes down to comps with offensive and defensive cooldowns so tier lists can be deceiving

[2022-12-16 23:29:11] <SuddenData> they have not
[2022-12-16 23:29:12] <Versiondk> @shalomski But you said they were easy one shots so the time spend on them is low anyways why not finish the m+ for crafting items for gear upgrades?
[2022-12-16 23:29:17] <+ugotserved_6> which of the 10 accounts is he taking
[2022-12-16 23:29:19] <%whtshdow> @thoorus99 is the only character with 4 set

[2022-12-16 23:30:19] <shalomski> they are mythic + hc cleared now, should honestly start mythic tbh, why wait to clear 1 or 2 more mythic + just to see if a few guys get a 1 item upgrade 🤔

[2022-12-16 23:34:59] <+majituwu> !elx
[2022-12-16 23:35:00] <shalomski> I'm not 1 of the noobs joining asking if this is hc or mythic etc,  been around a very long time....
[2022-12-16 23:35:09] <casioitsnotme> Where's scripe?
[2022-12-16 23:35:14] <+Scratchipants> tomorrow be mythic for sure
[2022-12-16 23:35:15] <Versiondk> @snorrow92 probably but im honestly not sure how many and if its every char or only "personal loot chance"
[2022-12-16 23:35:29] <blademasto> only 392 while liquid mage is at 400+
[2022-12-16 23:35:34] <Aspiko> @scratchipants that’s what everyone said yesterday
[2022-12-16 23:35:45] <mightylamb123> @shalomski well its neither right now because he is in the main city
[2022-12-16 23:35:46] <Snoizer93> @blademasto they are holding gear
[2022-12-16 23:35:48] <snorrow92> @blademasto gingi can get more loot distributed and crafted
[2022-12-16 23:35:59] <blademasto> ok cool
[2022-12-16 23:36:04] <+Scratchipants> @Aspiko but im the only person saying it today
[2022-12-16 23:36:06] <%paulibrap> @blademasto they havent gotten the loot yet;p
[2022-12-16 23:36:16] <shalomski> I know for sure there killing time to start mythic tmoz
[2022-12-16 23:36:22] <Aspiko> @scratchipants you’re taking a lot of risks there
[2022-12-16 23:36:25] <snorrow92> @blademasto and tbf gingi got fucked on by loot. he had a 395 ilvl mage that just needed 1 more set piece but didnt get it
[2022-12-16 23:36:43] <+Scratchipants> @Aspiko what can i say? i'm a risk taker

[2022-12-16 23:37:40] <shalomski> they knew 1hr ago who was going to be main or not, easily could of killed first 2/3 bosses without faffing,  but their building the hype, most likely hoping liquid kill 5th tbh

[2022-12-16 23:38:13] <Versiondk> I don't think anyone had thought the HC Rasz kills would take this long today though. But with them done we will for sure see mythic pulls tomorrow
[2022-12-16 23:38:15] <%Lataran> @shalomski good take

[2022-12-16 23:39:00] <+da44an> @shalomski don't they need higher ilvl in slot to get better gear?
[2022-12-16 23:39:33] <mightylamb123> @Aspiko tomorrow is their day off
[2022-12-16 23:39:42] <SuddenData> lol
[2022-12-16 23:39:49] <+Scratchipants> they're talking mythic rasz strats right now
[2022-12-16 23:39:50] <snorrow92> @da44an thats only from rares drop table. raids have set ilvl drops
[2022-12-16 23:39:55] <blademasto> they should all get 1700 m+ rating for free upgrd
[2022-12-16 23:39:56] <Atzepengzz> Can i raid mytic with écho?
[2022-12-16 23:40:01] <Versiondk> @Aspiko I mean at this point they might just wait an extra day just to mess with us LuL
[2022-12-16 23:40:26] <+ugotserved_6> i think shadow priests should get all the gear :)

[2022-12-16 23:41:25] <SuddenData> tbh, lol at the 3 bows from HC raz earlier... :S
[2022-12-16 23:41:46] <Nanny> if only one of the bows was a gingi helmet instead
[2022-12-16 23:41:56] <SuddenData> yeah
[2022-12-16 23:41:57] <Nanny> 396+ mage
[2022-12-16 23:42:08] <Versiondk> yeah 3 bows really makes you wonder if more hunters are worth bringing.. They are just paper and hits the floor easy though
[2022-12-16 23:42:10] <+Zar_WoW> 3 bows? Orly?
[2022-12-16 23:42:17] <Atzepengzz> I play Assa but only one dager

[2022-12-16 23:43:01] <+ugotserved_6> who won last race
[2022-12-16 23:43:04] <+aocAorus> @shunpo5 Clueless
[2022-12-16 23:43:06] <Nanny> almost 50% droprate on bow for their splits is insane tbh
[2022-12-16 23:43:09] <xotic87> Kungen
[2022-12-16 23:43:12] <%+DubTheSpencer> no place for 2 mages?
[2022-12-16 23:43:13] <jacobyteme> limit can't get past 50% this race isn't over
[2022-12-16 23:43:19] <jacobyteme> echo have the better gear
[2022-12-16 23:43:21] <LoxKR> No shot have they still not started mythic?
[2022-12-16 23:43:27] <ruediruempel> @shunpo5 seems like it. Limit is soon 5/8, Echo really needs to hurry otherwise race is over before Echo is even really starting LUL
[2022-12-16 23:43:34] <SuddenData> @Nanny ye, especially since it has such a low droprate, it is a truly wtf
[2022-12-16 23:43:38] <Tsjoepapke> first 4 bosses are quite easy, for them at least
[2022-12-16 23:43:38] <casioitsnotme> they probably gonna stop for today

[2022-12-16 23:44:49] <ruediruempel> Day 3 and still no mythic boss down?
[2022-12-16 23:45:17] <Tsjoepapke> which one did u down?
[2022-12-16 23:45:17] <blademasto> wonder if their ilvl will be higher then liquid
[2022-12-16 23:45:18] <insaniacc_> Chat, its almost like they prefer to be properly prepared for Mythic instead of just downing a few bosses and then being stuck cause they got shit gear
[2022-12-16 23:45:22] <Nanny> its almost like there used to be a full week for splits and prep before mythic release before this expac
[2022-12-16 23:45:22] <+Zenrixx> @ruediruempel no they gave up, just playing for fun now
[2022-12-16 23:45:24] <xotic87> @ruediruempel playing fortnite at the moment

[2022-12-16 23:45:54] <snorrow92> @blademasto probably close when they start mythic and overtaking when they down the first 4 bosses
[2022-12-16 23:45:56] <+seamuscg> unlucky

[2022-12-16 23:54:30] <%Lataran> @shalomski how can you be this attention seeking
[2022-12-16 23:54:30] <peepounhappy> monkaHmm  Are the still not finished with attunement quests for mythic?
[2022-12-16 23:54:36] <Versiondk> @SuddenData Dude no way. 375 ilvl takes way too long to grind. Take off that gear and make it actually challenging. I bet i could solo it all with 400 ilvl Kappa
[2022-12-16 23:54:41] <maliaxie> they are booking flights home for Christmas after they conceded Sadge
[2022-12-16 23:54:49] <Tsjoepapke> they agreed with liquid that they will give up this time, so its even again
