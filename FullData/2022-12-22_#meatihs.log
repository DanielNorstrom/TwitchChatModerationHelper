[2022-12-22 01:46:43] <+Brianbgrp> if your deck can't cast 15 mana worth of spells on turn 6, it's prolly dumpster tier :D

[2022-12-22 21:45:55] <@%Tinyfred> @ChopperTony Some people specifically want to lose mass to have more cardio (like marathon runners).

[2022-12-22 21:46:34] <@%Tinyfred> Long distance, cardio focused people don't want muscle mass because it drains oxygen.

[2022-12-22 21:48:32] <@%Tinyfred> I would just argue that being less active makes you increasingly less active because you lose energy and motivation, the loss of muscle mass is not a massive factor.

[2022-12-22 23:56:50] <Inn0x> Not if everyone is happy with it
[2022-12-22 23:56:53] <sonofman1930> Its good to have 1 wife tho.
[2022-12-22 23:56:54] <+xfeare> it can be likely to lead to bad outcomes but i dont think it's inherently immoral
[2022-12-22 23:56:54] <+zeemk> Depends imo
[2022-12-22 23:56:54] <%pontiferous> Like Mormons
[2022-12-22 23:56:55] <kaltsas1> your next poll
[2022-12-22 23:56:59] <+paddycakes> depends on where you get your morals
[2022-12-22 23:57:01] <+balansero87> If everyone is happy why not
[2022-12-22 23:57:01] <lore_twitch> not really
[2022-12-22 23:57:01] <Bladefire20> I'm not sure why it would be unless you appeal to some divine morality
[2022-12-22 23:57:07] <!%TopN0tchBanter> if every party involved is fine with it, then its ok

[2022-12-22 23:57:35] <sonofman1930> Well god called it a sin because people had so many idols back then. its hard to keep track of that many women.
[2022-12-22 23:57:39] <Taniss99> Isnt that just confirmation bias? You only hear about the bad examples because people dont complain when its good?
[2022-12-22 23:57:48] <Kiixxx> its not normal, only worked when the guy was a warlord
[2022-12-22 23:57:51] <hskookdoug> humans are inherently jealous/envious of others so it makes sense
[2022-12-22 23:57:55] <%DrGoghe> having 2 more husbands is nice right
[2022-12-22 23:57:56] <ELDORAD0> Everything that can happen in a plural marriage happens in a singular marriage

[2022-12-22 23:58:15] <Taniss99> Yeah sorry, confirmation bias isnt the right word
[2022-12-22 23:58:16] <+thom_smorc> yeah but toxicity is not inherent
[2022-12-22 23:58:30] <@%+DanTheGreat94> these polls seem kinda rigged kekw
[2022-12-22 23:58:41] <+paddycakes> did a twitch Chater just say they have 3 side bits of chicks. mate you're in twitch chat lol

[2022-12-22 23:58:59] <sonofman1930> Solomon was a wise king back in the day and he had a lot of wives but they were worshipping strange idols and it pissed god off.
