[2022-12-11 13:51:04] <+kipppo> I mean Blizzard are a small indie company they cant afford to hire people to test balance patches
[2022-12-11 13:51:10] <+implyzed> Its also so stupid how characters need to be paid for
[2022-12-11 13:51:10] <plastiqueandre> and for them to just wipe the meta off the face of the game one patch later? no one in their right mind would spend so much time like that, especially for free
[2022-12-11 13:51:16] <Schrizeh> blizzard are doing so bad financially in recent years
[2022-12-11 13:51:18] <+implyzed> Its litterally pay to win

[2022-12-11 13:55:01] <plastiqueandre> @evad3 you can't pin the fault of this game on the single players who spend 10$ once every two months, it should be the job of bigger creators with more traction to say "hey, this game is shitty, and altough I get money from it I won't support it anymore" then there will be change lol

[2022-12-11 13:56:59] <ketaruz> @emmy_ish hi emmy guraWave
[2022-12-11 13:57:01] <+Schutkleur> Thats why they should make balances per X amount of tiers.
[2022-12-11 13:57:03] <%+iTzBryaan> Yes.
[2022-12-11 13:57:04] <Evad3> @plastiqueandre you can literally blame everything to people not boycotting stupid stuff in the gaming industry.... early access people paying to test games of developers, people buying expensive skins, ingame stuff and so on, so they don't feel presured to change stuff, people pre-ordering games like cp2077 and much more. the common folks are the ones to blame
[2022-12-11 13:57:05] <Scotnoco> so wait if you are top 500 wouldn't you just want to play the meta and that's it? or we are talking about balancing so that you don't HAVE to run the meta
[2022-12-11 13:57:13] <bluelink6> they better fix all the crap theyve screwed up or by the time season 3 rolls around this shit gonna be dea frfr

[2022-12-11 14:05:14] <Evad3> paypal doesn't take 70%. BUT! if you sub to a streamer and pay 5.00$ twitch takes 50% which makes it 2.50$ before taxes, paypal takes another like 20-30 cents which makes it 2.20$ and then i'm pretty sure denmark has harsh income tax, like 30-40% which makes it so that kragiee has like 1.50ish left after taxes, paypal and twitch taking their interests

[2022-12-11 14:06:57] <@%emmy_ish> @Evad3 ez pz
[2022-12-11 14:07:14] <Evad3> @wesTadej yeah i was going of NA subs since they are prob. the most common

[2022-12-11 14:08:13] <Evad3> @wesTadej gifted subs are even less money somehow, because twitch makes it so that the streamer has to pay both transactions, the one between them and the gifter and the one between twitch and the streamer
[2022-12-11 14:08:16] <%agiro01> https://clips.twitch.tv/TangentialCuriousHyenaPJSalt-H4JTpfVu-wqJvUzm I used to dono only so that you get more BibleThump but it seems like I'm just fattening another corpo sadge

[2022-12-11 14:39:23] <+cjthedjdolphin> 15 seconds is an eternity for a shield. I'd rather it have less health and be able to be placed more often
[2022-12-11 14:39:55] <%ketaruz> maybe blizzard is afraid of shield tanks being meta again
[2022-12-11 14:39:57] <%zacku> iirc someone said that the shield is smaller than sig's

[2022-12-11 14:42:15] <shiki_o7> peepoTalk
[2022-12-11 14:42:32] <%zacku> @Cool_Hand cuz 90% of team 4 left 2 1 month after launch lol
[2022-12-11 14:42:40] <%zacku> they employed a bunch of new people
[2022-12-11 14:42:46] <itzfulmi> OW developers on their way to destroy the game (once again)
[2022-12-11 14:42:51] <EnnaCore> why does it feel like Freedo is talking around the topic :)
[2022-12-11 14:42:58] <EnnaCore> also good day peeps, happy Sunday
[2022-12-11 14:43:03] <Cool_Hand> so new people never heard abt overwatch since 2k18 :D
[2022-12-11 14:43:14] <%zacku> the only notable position is the lead hero design dude tho
[2022-12-11 14:43:16] <+Reap_purr> they genuinely balance the game around bronze players i fucking swear dude they never listen to top 500 opinions like ever
[2022-12-11 14:43:26] <retnuh_92> he talks too much
[2022-12-11 14:43:33] <Rune7s> those guys crrying so much giving me highh blood pressure lol
[2022-12-11 14:43:33] <%zacku> @Reap_purr thats the thing tho
[2022-12-11 14:43:44] <%zacku> only 2000 people are in like t500
[2022-12-11 14:43:54] <Rune7s> facts
[2022-12-11 14:43:58] <%zacku> so you either capitalize on the bronze for money
[2022-12-11 14:44:07] <%zacku> or just fuck every elo OMEGALUL
[2022-12-11 14:44:11] <+ItsCoolWhip> just make an OW equivalent to faceit and have different patches
[2022-12-11 14:44:25] <+Reap_purr> @zacku LMAO this is so true also im malding
[2022-12-11 14:44:49] <itzfulmi> I feel like a lot of YT's, streamers do not enjoy playing this game rn
[2022-12-11 14:45:06] <+ItsCoolWhip> @itzfulmi does anyone??

[2022-12-11 14:45:30] <+cjthedjdolphin> I would present the idea that since sojourn wasn't put into the game specifically to counter something, that the fact that she might not get played at low levels cause she's week doesn't break balancing in low SR, like it does break balancing with how strong she is in high sr
[2022-12-11 14:45:31] <itzfulmi> @itzfulmi Istg the devs want to kill this game
[2022-12-11 14:45:49] <+Steph_You_Up> blizzard doesnt care about top500 bc they'll play the game anyway. flats complained about how he hates the game on twitter and makes videos about his hate but will still play 8 hours a day. all these guys perspective is twisted because they play SO much. this is what happens when you make a hobby your livelihood. you get burnt out
[2022-12-11 14:45:55] <GGRafufu> This video feels sad

[2022-12-11 14:46:45] <%zacku> the thing with hog is that they removed 2 of the main hog counters OMEGALUL kiriko countering ana and mei no longer freeze his ass

[2022-12-11 14:48:14] <itzfulmi> Kragie I like your take on tanks, they should be kinda nerfed.
[2022-12-11 14:48:15] <%grudell> 1st
[2022-12-11 14:48:17] <emji_> i hope their longterm goal is to implement banning after they got the support character count up

[2022-12-11 14:48:52] <LauSVM> exactly
[2022-12-11 14:48:53] <ICrazyJI> And why remove maps? Just why?
[2022-12-11 14:48:54] <%zacku> its so bad lol
[2022-12-11 14:48:58] <+Reap_purr> bans would force people to flex play more though arguably
[2022-12-11 14:48:58] <Rune7s> herroo ban should be for when they have hugggg hero pools
[2022-12-11 14:49:04] <J4A9> Yup. Most powerful character would just get perma-banned until Blizzard nerfs it or buffs another one, and then the cycle starts anew @kragiee
[2022-12-11 14:49:04] <%zacku> everyone will just ban soj mercy
[2022-12-11 14:49:13] <+Slapo0> @reap_purr naaahh
[2022-12-11 14:49:16] <liranhashor> i think we miss a hitscan
[2022-12-11 14:49:23] <emji_> what freedo is saying is that there might be no way to have all characters balanced in all elos
[2022-12-11 14:49:30] <zuhoon> they probably dont add bans because there arent many characters
[2022-12-11 14:49:31] <r3661316> True
[2022-12-11 14:49:34] <SERJENT> Blizzard is bad at balancing
[2022-12-11 14:49:35] <skils> hero bans work in games like league and r6 because you can just swap characters mid-game like you can in OW
[2022-12-11 14:49:38] <itzfulmi> @kragiee I like your take on tanks, they should be nerfed
[2022-12-11 14:49:44] <+Krizzi___> league of legends does balanced changes so much
[2022-12-11 14:49:52] <ICrazyJI> I even said that Sojourn would get buffed while getting nerfed.
[2022-12-11 14:49:53] <J4A9> yeah
[2022-12-11 14:49:56] <+Slapo0> Brooo imagine they said balance patches every 3 months ICANT
[2022-12-11 14:50:06] <instr> blizzard cares more about shop prizes than balancing LULW
[2022-12-11 14:50:07] <Cool_Hand> too many casual players to do such balance maybe
[2022-12-11 14:50:13] <+Reap_purr> werent they saying how we're suppose to have more frequent like balance changes?
[2022-12-11 14:50:31] <Cool_Hand> we're always missing so many factors in the complete equation
[2022-12-11 14:50:38] <+Slapo0> @reap_purr yeah every 3 months instead of every year
[2022-12-11 14:50:38] <StopQuotingNoobs> in their defense the ow2 development team only has 5 people left
[2022-12-11 14:50:46] <r3661316> Dumpster Fire For Sure
[2022-12-11 14:50:50] <ICrazyJI> Next thing you know, they're going to charge us for a balance pass.
[2022-12-11 14:50:52] <itzfulmi> Sojourn, is in fact, buffed for low elo players
[2022-12-11 14:50:55] <+Reap_purr> @Slapo0 truly im crying lmaoo

[2022-12-11 14:51:09] <GGRafufu> Hero ban adds a bit of strategy to the game though I agree that it feels more of a covering up ow mistakes

[2022-12-11 15:12:05] <%+bandaqe> my bed has been under a window
[2022-12-11 15:12:05] <+JVPost> chat gpt: It's generally not a good idea to place your bed close to an open window for a few reasons. First, drafts can be uncomfortable and can make it difficult to sleep. Second, an open window can also let in noise from outside, which can be disruptive. Finally, an open window can also let in pests, such as mosquitoes or other insects. It's best to place your bed in a location that is free from drafts and other potential disruptions.
