[2022-12-09 15:39:31] <letswoolgather> wasting a season on bad balance causes people to leave so yeah bad support plan for bliz
[2022-12-09 15:39:31] <+Daiki__21> doing it off win rate i dont think is the play
[2022-12-09 15:39:33] <xxwrexialxx> yeah its pretty painful... I love the game, but balance is so unbalanced it can be a bit difficult. especially since I am not too skilled

[2022-12-09 15:40:14] <+factsmachine_> Yeah but Doom's punch should not stun, and his block should go back to what it was pre-patch and then he'd be balanced.

[2022-12-09 16:26:25] <Yopipimps> tbh tanks are probably harder to overtune on release cause you only got 1 spot

[2022-12-09 16:26:57] <DM_Steel> Ramattra's going to get played because he's new. If he was OP at the start, a bunch of players would stop playing him calling him a "dead hero" if he got nerfed. Now, when he gets buffed, he'll just keep getting played.
[2022-12-09 16:27:04] <+willygladboy> Need movement speed buff in the big dawg mode

[2022-12-09 16:32:35] <+DefnotKali> @entryfireghosthero yeah i think if ram's e was bigger, taller, or went out faster, or preferably all three he'd be a lot more viable when it comes to getting value out of nemi form
[2022-12-09 16:32:41] <%LuriaStars> What would be a good mobility buff to rammatra?
[2022-12-09 16:32:44] <blue_tetris> That would be cool if the cylinder went down.
[2022-12-09 16:32:45] <newness__> I think a second or two reduction on the shield would be good too
[2022-12-09 16:32:46] <%+billybp26> Vortex needs to go to the skybox
[2022-12-09 16:33:01] <entryfireghosthero> I think it would be cool to keep it kind of bad but get two charges, makes him more area denial oriented
[2022-12-09 16:33:06] <+robbo_155> orisa is unkillable
[2022-12-09 16:33:06] <Yopipimps> e needs a skill shot reward

[2022-12-09 16:33:26] <Queen_Conch> God it looks like Orisa just bullies ramatra
[2022-12-09 16:33:27] <+willygladboy> Nemesis form speed boost
[2022-12-09 16:33:33] <newness__> I agree love the left click
[2022-12-09 16:33:33] <elmoskiller> He doesnt needs mobility buff, just less slow on block
[2022-12-09 16:33:40] <newness__> Pretty unique
[2022-12-09 16:33:42] <+apiov> !drops
[2022-12-09 16:33:42] <IC1025> the only mobility buff he'd ever get would be a very small speed boost in Nemesis form and that'll never happen
[2022-12-09 16:33:45] <+thorboy73> but its hard th get kills with it :(
[2022-12-09 16:33:45] <blue_tetris> m1 puts out a nice stream of damage, feels good vs squishies.
[2022-12-09 16:33:45] <+robbo_155> lol
[2022-12-09 16:33:51] <+Pressing_Forward> that snare is so good, the enemies almost noticed it just now
[2022-12-09 16:33:53] <%LuriaStars> Would be cool if u could vortex yourself to levitate like sigma's ult
[2022-12-09 16:33:56] <arywants> His block should heal
[2022-12-09 16:34:04] <+DefnotKali> maybe ramattra's idea of "mobility" should be slowing other heroes down so he can catch up to them easier so if they just buff vortex that would help a lot
[2022-12-09 16:34:04] <Doomneto> he needs to be able to do something else while blocking, it just feels so helpless to block and slowly die

[2022-12-09 16:47:12] <%+Ob1WanKenoli> that punch attack is so satisfying
[2022-12-09 16:47:46] <+DefnotKali> @rottasimulaattori make E wider, taller, go out faster, lower the speed penalty from his block, maybe make his primary fire projectiles a little bit bigger
[2022-12-09 16:47:50] <1takejohn> bro i watched owl and i didnt get any league tokens. and i connected both accs

[2022-12-09 16:48:24] <asteski> gg
[2022-12-09 16:48:25] <Crosis86> The punches are def weak
[2022-12-09 16:48:31] <@%^StreamElements> If you're noticing ads at unfortunate times, Twitch now requires all streams to run ads at set intervals. We're not triggering them, they're on Twitch's end and out of our control.
[2022-12-09 16:48:31] <The_Squ_irrel> huh?
[2022-12-09 16:48:34] <IntelligentGoatt> I think his punches should do more damage to tanks but not to squishy's
[2022-12-09 16:48:35] <bulgingeyesrockstar> have you played red dead 2?
[2022-12-09 16:48:36] <Rachel3107> Emongg what‚Äôs your favorite voice line?
[2022-12-09 16:48:38] <%Culein_> yeah i hope mid season balances make him at least A tier
[2022-12-09 16:48:42] <+Driixx> feels like jq and ram were both balanced for 2 tank
[2022-12-09 16:48:43] <Bezemgast> I think his powerlevel is pretty good, some of the other tanks are just too much
[2022-12-09 16:48:43] <theburkadurka> squadWave squadWave squadWave
[2022-12-09 16:48:43] <%SpookyAzul> i feel like vortex shouldn't just ground enemies, but it should disable movement abilities
[2022-12-09 16:48:45] <%NoTthE_1> He is vulnerable from behind while blocking. They need to remove that
[2022-12-09 16:48:47] <Yopipimps> it sucks when orisa can both poke and be in your face better than ram
[2022-12-09 16:48:49] <rodrik1406> the punches are weak because they dont kill faster than omnic form imo
[2022-12-09 16:48:52] <+scorchers29> Ramattra feels like he fits in 6v6
[2022-12-09 16:48:56] <HermanZeMandrak> jq is really fun, i feel like ram has to many buttons that dont do very much
[2022-12-09 16:49:04] <ShxdowChar> You got the sigma emote I believe
[2022-12-09 16:49:06] <1takejohn> i like how everyone is suggesting buffs for ram

[2022-12-09 17:07:21] <+dookieshoes93> Remember when we thought ram countered echo?
[2022-12-09 17:07:22] <+phd_plague> @emongg what do you think of the new map? I find it really fun personally
[2022-12-09 17:07:22] <letswoolgather> @Nandor It just favors blizzard not the players. Working as intended
[2022-12-09 17:07:29] <mcchubby_ow> his entire team was absolutely garbage, i wouldn't put too much stock in that game @PBeetheFox . also, ranking system is very strange right now
[2022-12-09 17:07:41] <%+rhundley> @potatofosho its less trying to win, and more the fact we didn't have a chance. I've got as much chance of Wrestling a bear as I do beating a GM Tank v Tank
[2022-12-09 17:07:45] <+wetaworkshop> Would you buff ram @emongg ?
[2022-12-09 17:07:48] <%zonar_ow> anyone else still get confused on this map?
[2022-12-09 17:07:54] <+bisexualkaiju> @mcchubby_ow your team shouldn't have to be necessarily good or meta in a public match.
[2022-12-09 17:07:55] <Nandor> @Nandor Like everything blizz does
[2022-12-09 17:08:04] <%NoTthE_1> @zonar_ow yep

[2022-12-09 17:08:39] <letswoolgather> @Hipsteralpeo yes cant play new characters for two weeks in comp
[2022-12-09 17:08:41] <mcchubby_ow> @bisexualkaiju no of course not, however my point was moreso that particular game would not be a good game for the other person to look at as an example ofactual skill level
[2022-12-09 17:08:50] <Panath_> kiriko climbed back over the wall
[2022-12-09 17:08:51] <%zonar_ow> @Hipsteralpeo yes, ramattra's not in comp for another week and a half
[2022-12-09 17:08:55] <+PotatoFoSho> @rhundley isnt that the matchmakings fault more than the gm player just playing his game though? why blame them for 'sweating?'
[2022-12-09 17:08:56] <j10jep2> d
[2022-12-09 17:08:58] <+phd_plague> I feel like Rammatra's shield should last 5 seconds on a 15 second cool down. and make his Ravenous vortex do ticking damage unless you leave it and it instantly deals 20 damage.

[2022-12-09 17:09:09] <+factsmachine_> Make Vortex do 90 damage and make nemesis form give you a 10% speed boost and he'll be a solid tank. Not broken, but good

[2022-12-09 17:13:36] <chromecaviar> I think it's better to have new heroes be OP at release, then to perform as bad as Rammattra

[2022-12-09 17:13:40] <letswoolgather> vortex is a shallow pothole you know when you drove over it but doesn't slow you down much

[2022-12-09 17:14:13] <+phd_plague> @bisexualkaiju I agree. or if they use a movement ability it keeps them locked in the circle forcing them to run out instead of using ability
