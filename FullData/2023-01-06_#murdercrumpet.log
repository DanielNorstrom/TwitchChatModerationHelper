[2023-01-06 00:47:52] <%nefariouspatron> They gave Ryan such a pile, that he couldn't do anything except to rewrite. It all went wrong when the 3rd movie didn't continue anything that either earlier movie focused on

[2023-01-06 01:07:09] <%Scoobert_Dupert> I see what bobe is saying. It would eventually make the competition lose its shock factor. If the competition is super predictable, itâs not as entertaining.

[2023-01-06 01:08:12] <%TeeKhaySwag> Personally I think there's no way to avoid it. Part of the competition is winning over people in the lobby imo, there's a reason the lobby members outside of the judges get a vote sometimes
