[2022-12-22 03:02:10] <%MOSSUP> people make their own maps in Portal 2, they have been excellent too
[2022-12-22 03:02:20] <%メイシーちゃん (macycqt)> i love valve when it comes to them handling the community, they have so much freedom when it comes to mods
[2022-12-22 03:02:21] <%oiKhaled16OW> People been asking for map editor for years, they always said no

[2022-12-22 03:03:12] <%+squeezefresh> I could see there being a whole separate scene inside of the game for map creating. People can create maps around the delayed balance changes.

[2022-12-22 03:17:28] <mootsie> they should do a split-KOTH map, like on HOTS. need control of both points to gain capture

[2022-12-22 13:11:49] <pain__ow> Because when anyone plays rein now they play comps that just poke and melt him before he can get close
[2022-12-22 13:12:01] <pain__ow> Which is why rein without a lucio is miserable
[2022-12-22 13:12:06] <%BallinDani> @pain__ow Please stop baiting people, when 4 out of the top 5 ball players outright quit ball because they're stuck 4100 on him, he's a dogshit hero

[2022-12-22 13:23:58] <%+DapperSolem> My favorite character is the reaper guy. he is very powerfull. special move, honestly is one of the best in the game and so he comes equipped with these two revolvers and only takes about 3 or 4 shots to actually execute a kill so it comes really in handy specially when you come from the side.
