[2022-12-24 15:33:28] <KasuRequiem> I could probably never do that cause my fiance loves having like a thousand mixed seasonings XD
[2022-12-24 15:33:29] <silverswcrd> it's gonna be good later!! trust the process !!!!
[2022-12-24 15:33:29] <%Missygirl93> very zesty

[2022-12-24 15:33:32] <yourtypicalteenager> My mom went to Costco and TJ Max and was overwhelmed and will not go to another store until after Christmas. She said you had to scoot around people
[2022-12-24 15:33:35] <%eunicenotbad> simsie’s kitchen is indeed very pretty

[2022-12-24 15:34:04] <geeehmel> that would be fancy dog food
[2022-12-24 15:34:08] <bigbadbess> @yourtypicalteenager as a Costco employee I can confirm it was insanity and I regret every decision that led me to that moment lol
[2022-12-24 15:34:08] <angrypix88> hi
[2022-12-24 15:34:14] <+blunt420baddie> i love the kitchen
[2022-12-24 15:34:28] <laura_8910> Nooo you don’t need rosemary
[2022-12-24 15:34:29] <ImJakeDeason> so... Dan's mom gave you the recepie?
[2022-12-24 15:34:30] <%+quantumkestrel> That’s interesting, I’ve never heard of that.
[2022-12-24 15:34:30] <nerd1alert1> sounds yummy but also sounds optional
[2022-12-24 15:34:33] <%+EricaWonton> I still can't believe its not meat in mince pie but dried fruit, I'm still processing this knowledge
[2022-12-24 15:34:37] <OrganicCannedMonster95> I just saw saf and Tyler make figgy pudding, it looks like that
[2022-12-24 15:34:37] <%alphabetmafia_01> I also needed fresh rosemary for my roast and I couldn’t find any sadly
[2022-12-24 15:34:40] <KasuRequiem> It's progressively getting prettier rather than a giant raisin mound.
[2022-12-24 15:34:42] <%rrosieeeee> I have never heard of rosemary in mince pies
[2022-12-24 15:34:44] <$oof345> who's recipe is this
[2022-12-24 15:34:46] <sadie_2011> looks like a salad 🥗
[2022-12-24 15:34:48] <%+damecrabtree> Should avoid the white under the zest aka pith next time. It’s bitter
[2022-12-24 15:34:48] <%+littledicastanaccount> @EricaWonton i think it used to include meat a long time ago!
[2022-12-24 15:34:49] <silverswcrd> i guess it's to add a bit of savoury-ness
[2022-12-24 15:34:49] <squiblebaby> i’m watching you like i watch my sims LOL
[2022-12-24 15:34:49] <angrypix88> simsieLegend

[2022-12-24 16:03:55] <Undercover_Witch> Re-use to cook i mean, you can use it endlessly to bake this way ofcourse haha.
[2022-12-24 16:03:57] <%+samimain2> I believe no on reusing rice once baked like that
[2022-12-24 16:03:59] <%carlyeka> the rice will toast but you can still eat it

[2022-12-24 16:42:50] <vicky1128> @asvpalivia university if you want a like enclosed gaming experience, get famous if you want it to fold onto family gameplay a little more smoothly
[2022-12-24 16:42:52] <%+red56teaches> Middle
[2022-12-24 16:42:53] <$mjjj_> middle
[2022-12-24 16:42:54] <$NessieIsNotACat> start wherever youd like
[2022-12-24 16:42:54] <the_yodel> middle and work out
[2022-12-24 16:42:54] <ang_sier> I usually start in middle

[2022-12-24 16:43:00] <daniicasey> i start in the middle so its centered
[2022-12-24 16:43:01] <Jazzysbud> no pressure
[2022-12-24 16:43:01] <%+sweetmusicwoman> Start anywhere and go slow
[2022-12-24 16:43:02] <oliviatoledano> start going One direction only and then fold back every other row and insert rows and alternate folding back every other row as you do the horizontal lines
[2022-12-24 16:43:02] <%alicexaw> Look at a reference picture too that helps me
[2022-12-24 16:43:04] <spacelady___> you start anywhere, just fold it in half to put the others
[2022-12-24 16:43:06] <+diamondminek> you ca do the lattice on baking paper then slide it over

[2022-12-24 16:49:52] <ang_sier> @jaffah_cake I did it with the gingerbreads because because I didn't have powdered sugar for icing lol
[2022-12-24 16:49:52] <Flaming_Spork> pie
[2022-12-24 16:49:54] <%$lisa71670> Just a long strip around the edges and crimp with a fork is easier than a braid.
[2022-12-24 16:49:57] <%Vexasaurus_rex> It does! depending on the pastry!

[2022-12-24 16:50:47] <%+kennie329> You’re doing a great job simsie!
[2022-12-24 16:50:51] <clownactually> pie looks great!
[2022-12-24 16:50:51] <%+Ami_Bess> It looks so good! simsie10 simsie10 simsie10 simsie10
[2022-12-24 16:50:53] <oliviatoledano> it will be much easier if you roll them into longer thinner strips! you lose a lot of length once you braid.
[2022-12-24 16:50:57] <maddhatter9> I believe in you! Don’t stress ❤️❤️
[2022-12-24 16:51:00] <%+BylineBelife> It'll be fine.

[2022-12-24 16:51:18] <oliviatoledano> it'll look fine hidden in the braid!
[2022-12-24 16:51:19] <vicky1128> a tapered end could be good anyway
[2022-12-24 16:51:19] <sims4ever20> It looks good

[2022-12-24 16:51:26] <%+theartofeveryday> You can just make a spiral twist too as a trim
[2022-12-24 16:51:29] <%+snowy_flake> it’s ok!

[2022-12-24 17:17:19] <makaylaoctopi> The dino sweater is better than an apron
[2022-12-24 17:17:20] <ellathefrog12> me and my family are going up on a mountain for christmas dinner and im totally not having an absolute mental breakdown worried that the ice on the road is gonna throw us off the rosd

[2022-12-24 17:17:35] <leah_lol42> Dino sweater is obviously wayyy better than an apron
[2022-12-24 17:17:36] <%DjArtemis1> My office has a joke about dinosaur Christmas sweaters. We all have them.
[2022-12-24 17:17:36] <@%goosekingdom> i would love a merch apron with cats on it
[2022-12-24 17:17:40] <%+theartofeveryday> I never wear an apron
[2022-12-24 17:17:42] <zoeanndc> what are we making right now?
[2022-12-24 17:17:42] <%thebigmac0125> I just got her second cookbook for Christmas! Love her!
[2022-12-24 17:17:46] <%+spidergwens> my mom just talked to a woman who said it’s colder here (maryland) then where she traveled from (massachusetts) which is crazy to me
[2022-12-24 17:17:47] <$NessieIsNotACat> i feel like half the poeple who yell at u during baking streams give advice like they have never baked anything in their lives
[2022-12-24 17:17:48] <%+evolspell> I still think a lilsimsie sensitive apron would be good merch
[2022-12-24 17:17:48] <%irmiej> @goosekingdom Yess!

[2022-12-24 17:50:20] <%belle_the_cota> I'm usually too intimidated to try baking. I'm a novice level baker and then I moved to elevation a few years ago which has made it even harder.

Suggestions are always appreciated, but do not attempt to make demands or force Kayla to do anything. There is a difference between friendly suggestions and aggressive demands. Ultimately she is the one playing the game, not you! simsieNo

[2022-12-24 18:04:02] <$greendragon1997> depending on you recipe some people will store mince pie filling in a jar for a year or more to develop the flavor
[2022-12-24 18:04:02] <+jodinorawr> Anyone else here because they’re spending Xmas alone?
