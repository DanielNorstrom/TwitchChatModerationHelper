[2023-01-03 00:03:28] <+aL_KUPOwn> too many players have no desire to improve or rank up, they just bitterly addicted and autopilot in ranked
[2023-01-03 00:04:06] <+aL_KUPOwn> you are unfortunately the minority who has passion and care to get better and play against better people

[2023-01-03 05:05:15] <colachacha> @Diablosco I play on mercy so my trick is you can boost flying to target you want to heal and prest jump back while holdingin and you hovering back, and repeat that, if you have airborne you just constanly hold jump

[2023-01-03 05:06:26] <jkens2000> Tank definitely is the most important role too though so make sure you know what you‚Äôre at before you start playing some comp games
[2023-01-03 05:06:33] <Emoll1ent> @jkens2000 healing doesnt mattter, its aou tutility
[2023-01-03 05:06:43] <zozo_fm> moira is so good at healing its just frustrating when she runs out and the other healer isnt healing lol
[2023-01-03 05:06:45] <%+mysticangel18> Mei just getting speared in the face lol
[2023-01-03 05:06:56] <jkens2000> Healing is important when your team is dying
[2023-01-03 05:07:22] <Diablosco> yeah i played like 20 games now, and its fun but i wanna learn how to help  and be beter sk8Joy

[2023-01-03 05:08:53] <jkens2000> Moira is also so much better than mercy at low elo because you can carry as her. Mercy depends heavily on if your dps can kill anything and most of the time they cant

[2023-01-03 05:11:09] <%fatguy925> The fact that mei can self heal, and then us wall the escape makes her so strong
[2023-01-03 05:11:12] <jkens2000> She has so much sustain too its annoying dps need to gun her down

[2023-01-03 05:12:09] <jkens2000> Shes not actually op just an annoying character to play
[2023-01-03 05:12:09] <sparethunder> question everyone... what's your opinion on Reaper?
[2023-01-03 05:12:35] <jkens2000> @sparethunder use only if your team cant kill tanks
[2023-01-03 05:12:38] <%+mysticangel18> reaper = tanker killer
[2023-01-03 05:12:40] <sparethunder> im a reaper main and have been since early OW1, im honestly pissed at how badly they have nerfed him
[2023-01-03 05:12:49] <%fatguy925> Good deny AYAYA
[2023-01-03 05:13:00] <Emoll1ent> @sparethunder didnt they buff him
[2023-01-03 05:13:04] <%+mysticangel18> brother nerf?
[2023-01-03 05:13:17] <sparethunder> they gave a SLIGHT buff back to his damage
[2023-01-03 05:13:17] <Diablosco> @sparethunder how did they nerfed him, sorry i am really new into this game
[2023-01-03 05:13:20] <%infrablack98> I liked this new map reminds of uncharted lol

[2023-01-03 05:14:03] <sparethunder> to actually stand a fight anymore, Reaper now NEEDS a healer on his butt
[2023-01-03 05:14:04] <murraymaster777> Reaper did get an indirect nerf to his ult charge if you focus on damaging tanks (tanks give reduced ult charge per unit point of damage)

[2023-01-03 12:49:57] <ViperExp> the longer youre on someone, the bigger and stronger the beam

[2023-01-03 12:50:01] <+superalex218> You keep doing damage to people

[2023-01-03 12:50:53] <JamjaneunSup> your beam does more damage when the enemy is at 50% hp
[2023-01-03 12:51:08] <ryanroserg> Don‚Äôt use the big beam unless they‚Äôre below half hp to get the most damage
[2023-01-03 12:51:08] <JamjaneunSup> its like a finisher basically.

[2023-01-03 15:51:25] <%+Forkitron> @Ra1nbowFlux kinda like sigma? the shield and his E helps contest choke points, but when the fight gets taken too far in or even onto the point, you go fist mode for the team brawl. and i only have defense in mind with that

[2023-01-03 18:17:07] <%+nogdogd> @Jindojay sounds like an average game of moira tbh
[2023-01-03 18:17:08] <m0m0dile> more power boost and pay attention to the other team members

[2023-01-03 18:17:10] <+Jedmumu> support isnt easy
[2023-01-03 18:17:13] <%atomchoco> you said chill LUL
[2023-01-03 18:17:14] <Acari_16> @Jindojay she can revive all right?
[2023-01-03 18:17:15] <skyrazak> ariaHYPERS
[2023-01-03 18:17:19] <%+nogdogd> support is very easy
[2023-01-03 18:17:22] <Jana22544> sitting like that is like the best position to game
[2023-01-03 18:17:23] <Jindojay> @Jindojay she used to
[2023-01-03 18:17:24] <eggs0808> Brig best support (imo)
[2023-01-03 18:17:32] <%+nogdogd> hard to climb but very easy...

[2023-01-03 18:18:11] <OnlyTees> I think support is one of the hardest positions in OW2. You have to have good map awareness, game sense and you depend on your teamates alot
[2023-01-03 18:18:13] <m0m0dile> you need to be in the air almost constantly as merc
[2023-01-03 18:18:14] <%+nogdogd> @eggs0808 weird take she awful
[2023-01-03 18:18:14] <m0m0dile> ppl dont like to look up
[2023-01-03 18:18:15] <Jindojay> @Jindojay but i lost 5 straight comp games. so this was a good morale boost

[2023-01-03 18:18:20] <%markpygas> Mercy dies to a light breeze
[2023-01-03 18:18:28] <%+PrizeGottiGaming> I miss the days were mercy was far more useful, she probably got the biggest nerf out of all of them
[2023-01-03 18:18:30] <%+nogdogd> @OnlyTees depending on ur team does not make a role hard
[2023-01-03 18:18:33] <+WiinterKiid> i think playing mercy is the reason why i have really bad stick drift
[2023-01-03 18:18:33] <%xigbar45> Don‚Äôt lose hope you can do it
[2023-01-03 18:18:34] <eggs0808> She‚Äôs good in the right situations
[2023-01-03 18:18:35] <%+nogdogd> its called unbalanced
[2023-01-03 18:18:46] <m0m0dile> honestly mercy is still the best healer if you know how to maneuver

[2023-01-03 18:19:27] <OnlyTees> @nogdogd but you still have to pay attention to your positioning the most, more than a tank imo
[2023-01-03 18:19:47] <%+ACPSpiffer> @Acari_16 that is never an accident

[2023-01-03 22:57:47] <%Vini_Sensei> If one of your teammates has left the match, the game will tell you it's safe to leave the match without a penalty‚Äîthough you will still get a loss.
