[2022-12-19 14:13:38] <TheMockingbird66> the more powerful nemesis mode kinda makes up for vortex being very meh. Kit in total is more balanced
[2022-12-19 14:13:39] <michellemarsh58> just on my way to a 7hr shift sad violin music stuck in traffic on the bus. Least it gives me more time watch stream before I gotta start work

[2022-12-19 14:13:49] <InsomniaLozenges> He needs a pocket healer or else he's still quite weak
[2022-12-19 14:14:00] <InsomniaLozenges> If he has a pocket healer he's better than most, without he's weaker than msot

[2022-12-19 14:14:13] <srinu150> tracer feels same as 5 dmg as with 5.5 dmg tbh. thoughts on her emong?
[2022-12-19 14:14:14] <ItsCraigAgainZA> i think the slow on the vortex is a bit much, but otherwise the tanks are looking pretty good now

[2022-12-19 14:15:23] <inkhearts> agreed. as a mercy/kiriko girl myself, it doesnt do much lol
[2022-12-19 14:15:44] <argenteaa> also support main and haven’t had issues with his vortex
[2022-12-19 14:15:45] <%+P01S0N_IV> slowed more than vortex NODDERS
[2022-12-19 14:15:52] <InsomniaLozenges> Reduce the left to right, increase the top to bottom radius
[2022-12-19 14:15:53] <argenteaa> it’s his ult that’s nasty
[2022-12-19 14:15:55] <ItsCraigAgainZA> maybe reduce speed reduction but stop movement abilities

[2022-12-19 14:16:44] <+NakiKataki> doesn't it mess up winston's jump?
[2022-12-19 14:16:47] <trrblegrlfrnd> sombra can hack her
[2022-12-19 14:16:47] <inkhearts> as soon as I saw your and flats original vid demonstration of the vortex of pharah, I knew it was a bad ability (for the moment)
[2022-12-19 14:16:48] <Archybaldie> its so jarring to be hitting a sweet roll out then yoink

[2022-12-19 14:17:00] <%+ZeoBishop> the only person i have pulled down is lucio and while junk is mine jumping
[2022-12-19 14:17:03] <denji_pro325> Hey emongg, any tips for getting better as tank?
[2022-12-19 14:17:13] <FireLordKalglo> vortex is fine if you get someone (who has no horizontal mobility) in the middle of it and can rush them, but it's cast time and arc means you pretty much catch people on the edge of its radius who then escape super easy unless you fire into a group and hope
[2022-12-19 14:17:20] <jlcat0207> i find it usefull against winston
[2022-12-19 14:17:46] <inkhearts> I was also confused! I thought the purpose (in the previews at least) was to counter pharrah, mercy, and echo but like....????
[2022-12-19 14:17:55] <InsomniaLozenges> The horizontal is too big, i feel like verticlal height is more important
[2022-12-19 14:18:10] <InsomniaLozenges> Reduce it's horizontal radius and increase it's vertical radius
[2022-12-19 14:18:23] <trrblegrlfrnd> does twitch have subtitles ?
[2022-12-19 14:18:26] <%+JackManSparrow> Good morning Emongg, good morning everyone
[2022-12-19 14:18:32] <ItsCraigAgainZA> i rate if it cancelled movement abilities it would be in the perfect spot
[2022-12-19 14:18:33] VIEWERS: 358
[2022-12-19 14:18:37] <inkhearts> even in bronze with mercy's.....it just doesnt do much
[2022-12-19 14:18:40] <+KGB170> It’s cool for finishing kills as a lower ranked tank where there isn’t as much team follow up lol
[2022-12-19 14:18:40] <Archybaldie> i think it would be more fun if it stuck to walls and ceilings so you could have more pull directions.
[2022-12-19 14:18:45] <InsomniaLozenges> As a Pharah main i kinda just laugh at it LUL
[2022-12-19 14:18:50] <%+ZeoBishop> @trrblegrlfrnd yea the streamer has to turn it on i think
[2022-12-19 14:19:10] <FireLordKalglo> I find it most useful as a slow to affect engages when disengaging (like throw it at my feet when I'm running away from opposing Ramattra ult)
[2022-12-19 14:19:14] <trrblegrlfrnd> @zeobishop thanks

[2022-12-19 14:19:22] <InsomniaLozenges> If they increase the vertical height (as a pharah main) i would panic but he needs it

[2022-12-19 15:21:46] <+seein_oz> problem with DF now, dumping all the cooldowns no longer results in a kill. so u dive in, not get a kill and stand there till they come off cooldown to get away
[2022-12-19 15:21:49] <pigz_e> @ynokrolo very good question
[2022-12-19 15:21:53] <arandomjo3> Ramattra ult is crazy when on overtime
[2022-12-19 15:21:55] <Midnide> i think revert all to the pre nerf and just lower the health gained
[2022-12-19 15:22:20] <ynokrolo> as a DOOM player this nerfs fell pretty strong

[2022-12-19 15:23:02] <pigz_e> i think having stun on regular punch is annoying they should make cooldown back to 3 and make it so theres a 0.5 sec stun from normal punch when you hit a wall

[2022-12-19 15:45:00] <@%zambam5> the tok never lies
[2022-12-19 15:45:11] <@%zambam5> emongg just never plays against good junkrats Kapp
[2022-12-19 15:45:14] <+FragsByTheFoot> It makes sense to me Kappa
[2022-12-19 15:45:16] <tonyhawk1026> who's the worst hero in each role in your opinion
[2022-12-19 15:45:19] <wickaman90> hi everyone!

[2022-12-19 15:45:34] <Huskystar1> they probably think rein counters junk
[2022-12-19 15:45:48] <ChristianSharkTV> People have been saying Junkrat is OP lately & as long as Pharah & Widow exist I will hard disagree LUL
[2022-12-19 15:45:51] <%+xylib> I play junkrat a lot so I can confirm, not a counter to dva
[2022-12-19 15:45:53] <fakekeks> @tonyhawk1026 hog, sombra, brigitte
[2022-12-19 15:46:09] <%+Kbezon12> so about JQ being viable ?
[2022-12-19 15:46:12] <wickaman90> Wasnt that the one wher pharah was a counter to pretty much everyone?

[2022-12-19 15:46:55] <@%zambam5> I watched an emongg video recently where a junkrat jumped ontop of a roof and killed a pharah
[2022-12-19 15:46:55] <2bitmel> junkrat isn't op he's just not fun to play against. whenever i get a game without a junkrat in the lobby I relish it
[2022-12-19 15:46:57] <%Culein_> FeelsOkayMan
[2022-12-19 15:46:58] <+willygladboy> Sym is besg
[2022-12-19 15:46:58] <ChristianSharkTV> Oh he's good but he has some very exploitable weaknesses.
[2022-12-19 15:47:02] <@%zambam5> junk clearly counters pharah
[2022-12-19 15:47:02] <+mirel1983> Seagulls JR is insane
[2022-12-19 15:47:03] <JustSwufty> Sombra is fine
[2022-12-19 15:47:06] <Midnide> i wish his Ult didn't have this much range. It'sd silly sometimes
[2022-12-19 15:47:13] <%+plushcap> junk is op in gold where people stay in the choke for a minute YEP
[2022-12-19 15:47:14] <pocketwolfspitz> Junk should not be able to one shot change my mind
[2022-12-19 15:47:26] <%$TonyBandito13> can confirm through Seagulls j silly streams. hes strong

[2022-12-19 15:48:09] <+moccagaming> Or they have a Sojourn or Soldier being boosted by Mercy and you die anyway xD
[2022-12-19 15:48:11] <wickaman90> Good Junkrat player are scary
[2022-12-19 15:48:12] <+bisexualkaiju> doesn't echo work against junkrat too?
[2022-12-19 15:48:14] <%+plushcap> yeah the junk will be higher in the air than pharah, tru it happens KEKW
[2022-12-19 15:48:26] <tto_fly> Is ash good
[2022-12-19 15:48:27] <+visceron85> Not to mention Ana and one hitscan will shut pharah down
[2022-12-19 15:48:27] <%purpleeggshells_> @bisexualkaiju that wasn't his point lol
[2022-12-19 15:48:30] <spicyblanket> yeah but not everyone is good at widow
[2022-12-19 15:48:33] <+willygladboy> Ash is great
[2022-12-19 15:48:33] <widowmakre> i feel like the only top 500 pharah main is yznsa
[2022-12-19 15:48:33] <RoadRunner27> go widow YEP
[2022-12-19 15:48:40] <+bisexualkaiju> @purpleeggshells_ i know, i'm just asking a question.
[2022-12-19 15:48:48] <Tamamiitsune> nothing scary than seeing a junkrat chasing the pharah and getting her
[2022-12-19 15:48:54] <%cielyphant> Good evening chatters!

[2022-12-19 15:49:01] <%purpleeggshells_> @bisexualkaiju then yes obviously another flying character will counter the ground rat
[2022-12-19 15:49:07] <maliketh_s_blade> rammattra is actually really good
[2022-12-19 15:49:09] <Huskystar1> does balls shield give sojourns rail gun less charge @Emongg
[2022-12-19 15:49:09] <ChristianSharkTV> I mean yeah it is very player skill dependant. But also Junkrat's weaknesses are a LOT easier to exploit than Sojourn's

[2022-12-19 15:49:21] <tto_fly> Is ash good for countering something
[2022-12-19 15:49:29] <maliketh_s_blade> that thing does not die
[2022-12-19 15:49:31] <+adawg2025> Is it just me or is his facecam not matching his words?
[2022-12-19 15:49:38] <pocketwolfspitz> I think junk mine should either be for mobility or damage.  Not both
[2022-12-19 15:49:42] <@%zambam5> noshow_jones PogU extra money is great
[2022-12-19 15:49:43] <+visceron85> Echo is less effective at range than pharah
[2022-12-19 15:49:47] <+visceron85> But yeah

[2022-12-19 15:50:30] <ChristianSharkTV> Oh yeah I get the occasional Pharah that is way lower than they should be LUL
[2022-12-19 15:50:33] <+bisexualkaiju> @Emongg He said, "Aw yes, I just got my pussy pocket."
[2022-12-19 15:50:35] <Tamamiitsune> i would not pocket him after hearing that
[2022-12-19 15:50:45] <@%zambam5> that might be more wild than the vikings coming back from 33-0 KEKW

[2022-12-19 15:51:25] <%faultysaeg> That's why you don't hook and ladder in a draw
[2022-12-19 15:51:32] <%LauSVM> I think gold is a bit too strong
[2022-12-19 15:51:34] <+bisexualkaiju> omg he's still going
[2022-12-19 15:51:36] <ChristianSharkTV> He's a glass cannon. Whether he carries or dies every two seconds is very match/player dependent

[2022-12-19 15:51:56] <CassiHikari> It goes blink blink blink
[2022-12-19 15:52:01] <%notanoobiswr> they increased the blast radius of his grenades
[2022-12-19 15:52:04] <ChristianSharkTV> It feels slightly longer range.
[2022-12-19 15:52:08] <+vrcool0> what the hell did he just say I got my pussy pocket
[2022-12-19 15:52:18] <%ProfWindbag> chat i have hot take about orisa - orisa is kind of a cheese pick that makes it ez to ape teams and just live and hold click
[2022-12-19 15:52:20] <+Vaenenosa> Yea
[2022-12-19 15:52:20] <+bisexualkaiju> @vrcool0 he said, "damn, that pussy fat."
[2022-12-19 15:52:21] <%+KShellZx> they should bury junk's trap more in the ground, it's too easy to see
[2022-12-19 15:52:30] <%notanoobiswr> Junkrat is really good against doom
[2022-12-19 15:52:34] <ChristianSharkTV> The explosion radius is still kinda funky to get perfect. Sometimes I snipe people with it & others I can't hit people two inches in front of me
[2022-12-19 15:52:46] <+Vaenenosa> At the beginning of the match he said that
[2022-12-19 15:52:46] <OrderOfKhaos> Orisa is the main tank I go to when playing tank.

[2022-12-19 15:53:02] <+dmdmg3000> This might be a dumb question, but when do they plan to start calling OW2 just OW?
[2022-12-19 15:53:10] <%stillarobyn> @profwindbag i don't think she's cheese, she's got strong ability rotation but punishable
[2022-12-19 15:53:16] <ChristianSharkTV> I've been a Junkrat main since day 1 & lemme tell you him being meta is a nice change of pace
[2022-12-19 15:53:17] <@%zambam5> dmdmg3000 never I assume
[2022-12-19 15:53:30] <Kibbles193> @dmdmg3000 Why the fuck would they do that exactly?
[2022-12-19 15:53:43] <RoadRunner27> Trapping people in a corner with orisa is so much fun
[2022-12-19 15:53:43] <%ProfWindbag> @stillarobyn its just my hot take
[2022-12-19 15:53:52] <%+TheHeavyHenk> I feel like sigma is really good against roadhog aswell ye?
[2022-12-19 15:53:54] <+aaymon86> They should reduced some of Hogs cooldown in the meantime
[2022-12-19 15:53:54] <widowmakre> huuuge ukt
[2022-12-19 15:53:59] <@%zambam5> man I thought that suzu was gonna get them out
[2022-12-19 15:53:59] <widowmakre> ult*
[2022-12-19 15:54:01] <NoiseCrush> it looked like they were out of the circle to me
[2022-12-19 15:54:19] <+aaymon86> And if it wasn't to mess Hog up, that didn't stop them from messing up Doom lol
[2022-12-19 15:54:20] <@%zambam5> the best dps will never not be torb
[2022-12-19 15:54:20] <%LauSVM> Orisa kinda melts if you have ranged dps and zen
[2022-12-19 15:54:23] <+dmdmg3000> @dmdmg3000 I thought that was the sentiment during beta. OW2 will be the new OW
[2022-12-19 15:54:24] <%LauSVM> she has counters
[2022-12-19 15:54:30] <+bisexualkaiju> Junkrat's my favorite for dps, but I agree, Soldier 76 feels good.
[2022-12-19 15:54:37] <Huskystar1> im obssessed with the echo OWL skin
[2022-12-19 15:54:40] <%notanoobiswr> they should buff soldier dmg back. When they nerfed him it's so hard to confirm kills
[2022-12-19 15:54:40] <BAMrhino> I’m a mei enjoyer
[2022-12-19 15:54:42] <widowmakre> my brother has been a moira main since her release imagine how he feels  😭😭
[2022-12-19 15:54:45] <ChristianSharkTV> The Bastion rework instantly made him my favorite hitscan. i rotate between him & Junk all the time
[2022-12-19 15:54:48] <%+solwold_> echo is fun until you dont get constant heals
[2022-12-19 15:54:50] <@%zambam5> @dmdmg3000 it's the "new overwatch" in that you can't play overwatch 1 anymore. it straight up replaced it
[2022-12-19 15:54:56] <widowmakre> he's a flex support too but he's got ~180 hours on moira

[2022-12-19 15:55:07] <wickaman90> It is still crazy to me hgo well they reworked Ortisa, She is really fun to play. i hope they can do that with some other heroes too that dont get much playtime right now.
[2022-12-19 15:55:10] <+dmdmg3000> @zambam5 indeed it did
[2022-12-19 15:55:12] <Huskystar1> THEY CLICKED BUTTONS
[2022-12-19 15:55:36] <%LauSVM> @wickaman90 True. I'm thinking rein could use a lot more
[2022-12-19 15:55:46] <NoiseCrush> haha the kiriko learned from her mistake with that ult last time
[2022-12-19 15:55:48] <juliemarbbb> damn suzu
[2022-12-19 15:55:49] <harmless1010> what are the drops?
[2022-12-19 15:55:50] <+bisexualkaiju> if only orisa's ut could do things more reliably.
[2022-12-19 15:55:55] <widowmakre> yup 💀
[2022-12-19 15:55:56] <fart_typhoon> Suzu Sadge
[2022-12-19 15:56:04] <Forsakei> Kiriko's Suzu is overloaded imo
[2022-12-19 15:56:07] <NoiseCrush> it is very funny when a basic ability counters an ultimate
[2022-12-19 15:56:07] <juliemarbbb> really need to bait that suzu first…
[2022-12-19 15:56:08] <JustSwufty> Suzuuuu
[2022-12-19 15:56:12] <%ProfWindbag> remember when we complained about lamp?
[2022-12-19 15:56:14] <wickaman90> @LauSVM so true. Also Wrecking Ball and Brigitte
[2022-12-19 15:56:17] <fart_typhoon> Suzu and lamp is fun
[2022-12-19 15:56:30] <widowmakre> omg that sojourn melted
[2022-12-19 15:56:31] <%LauSVM> Yeah I don't think 14 second cooldown abilities should nullify ultimates at all
[2022-12-19 15:56:33] <+aaymon86> A well timed suzu can win games.  It's OP
[2022-12-19 15:56:34] <BAMrhino> They should speed up her damage build up in ult
[2022-12-19 15:56:38] <JustSwufty> Kiriko ends everything you ever do...
[2022-12-19 15:56:40] <+bisexualkaiju> my favorite is when i used suzu to counter reaper ult entirely lol.
[2022-12-19 15:56:46] <martotushka> @lausvm yeah sleep is kinda op

[2022-12-19 15:57:10] <%faultysaeg> @NoiseCrush Cassidy's Flash Bang countered Reaper ult since day one. This is intended game mechanics.
[2022-12-19 15:57:11] <+bisexualkaiju> and even though they nerfed kiriko's ult, when done well, it's still kind of an insta win.

[2022-12-19 15:57:30] <Kibbles193> There's a lot of Overwatch happening right there
[2022-12-19 15:57:34] <NoiseCrush> @NoiseCrush that is also funny, in fact that's probably funnier than suzu
[2022-12-19 15:57:52] <widowmakre> the SUZU😭😭
[2022-12-19 15:57:53] <juliemarbbb> i suzu a 5k highnoon before and won the game for the team. felt so great i almost cried
[2022-12-19 15:58:09] <+bisexualkaiju> @NoiseCrush Who would win, abomination against nature or one humble cowpoke?
[2022-12-19 15:58:10] <+vrcool0> Does overwatch have proximity chat
[2022-12-19 15:58:18] <JustSwufty> No.
[2022-12-19 15:58:32] <ChristianSharkTV> Nope normal chat
[2022-12-19 15:58:35] <JustSwufty> There's voice chat, but not proximity..
[2022-12-19 15:58:35] <%LauSVM> Hot take: Tanks should be as tanky as they were in OW1. No need for one person on the team to be 3 times strong as the others. It makes the contribution imbalanced
[2022-12-19 15:58:52] <Forsakei> @LauSVM agree
[2022-12-19 15:59:00] VIEWERS: 2 021
[2022-12-19 15:59:02] <+bisexualkaiju> Then they'd probably have to put two tanks again.
[2022-12-19 15:59:03] <widowmakre> what is proximity chat
[2022-12-19 15:59:14] <Kibbles193> @LauSVM Good luck getting anyone to play the game if you just have an entirely useless role
[2022-12-19 15:59:15] <MellowzTV> proximity with enemies would be HILARIOUS
[2022-12-19 15:59:21] <alansita> SeemsGood Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm
[2022-12-19 15:59:22] <audka> sombra listening in on their comms the whole game lol
[2022-12-19 15:59:24] <Ulvhir> have to get close and personal with the people you wanna flame Kappa
[2022-12-19 15:59:27] <JustSwufty> @widowmakre it's like Vr Chat
[2022-12-19 15:59:30] <%+LionHeartEVGC> makes no sense, teams would just be comming over each other
[2022-12-19 15:59:32] <Kibbles193> @MellowzTV The sensory overload would be insane KEKW
[2022-12-19 15:59:33] <NoiseCrush> that would make sombra a really interesting character
[2022-12-19 15:59:41] <+CarsonWuzHair> At my rank prox chat would be the same… silence.
[2022-12-19 15:59:52] <Kibbles193> KEKW
[2022-12-19 15:59:55] <MellowzTV> in low elo no one shotcalls so it would just be shittalking eachother all game
[2022-12-19 15:59:55] <wickaman90> @LauSVM i feel some tanks would be completely uselss then.
[2022-12-19 15:59:57] <%LauSVM> @Kibbles193 how would 400 hp with the same abilities be useless?
[2022-12-19 16:00:02] <JustSwufty> Or when you die in warzone and people just scream at you for killing them
[2022-12-19 16:00:11] <JustSwufty> they*
[2022-12-19 16:00:13] <+lazorbheemz> @LauSVM also you would have gigachad healers if everyone the same
[2022-12-19 16:00:26] <Kibbles193> @LauSVM Think about how much damage DPS AND Support does and lemme know how long you'd live in that situation. Think about it for literally 2 seconds
[2022-12-19 16:00:29] <MellowzTV> I played Rust for a long time, proximity can be so damn funny

[2022-12-19 16:02:55] <Kibbles193> @LauSVM Huh? Tanks are stronger in OW2. Now you're literally making the opposite point KEKW If you think only having one tank with 400HP would survive on a battlefield with Zen and Sojurn then I want what you are smoking

[2022-12-19 16:13:12] <widowmakre> idk if you know but for most console players, the career profiles are bugged as hell. i have about 40 hours on echo and atleast 20 on every support, yet during the OW2 changeover, only ~4 hours for each support came in. it's so annoying and it's been months and they haven't changed it
[2022-12-19 16:13:21] <fakekeks> @jhoana_zay brig isn't playable in long range fights
[2022-12-19 16:13:27] <widowmakre> and echo was cut to 20 hours

[2022-12-19 16:27:51] <ChristianSharkTV> Lucio's just one of the most universally good heroes in the game. Unless it's a flying character he can work with almost anyone

[2022-12-19 16:28:27] <!%xx_m3m3_m4chine_420_69_xx> @inxx89 you can always play a game of comp or two to see how it is. if you get absolutely rolled, then perhaps a little more qp.
[2022-12-19 16:29:05] <%stillarobyn> @inxx89 I think you should be familiar enough with the game and abilities before starting comp. Know what everyone can do, and have good enough map knowledge to know where healthpacks, etc are

[2022-12-19 16:43:25] <+nobara_jjkai> Junker queen and sombra needs a buff
[2022-12-19 16:43:45] <DarkFlameShade> Sombra does not need a buff. 😅
[2022-12-19 16:43:46] <T34Boss> What I hear you saying is she's better if they aren't running kiriko!
[2022-12-19 16:43:49] <lesterspring20> Sombra needs to be removed
[2022-12-19 16:43:50] <T34Boss> haha
[2022-12-19 16:43:54] <KlappHS> And how about ramattra?
[2022-12-19 16:43:54] <+Phoenixx_Right> a game without sombra is a good game lol
[2022-12-19 16:43:54] <rabidraider19> okay chat theoretical question. If I go in and out of the stream and keep watching ads does emongg get any revenue or only twitch?

[2022-12-19 16:43:58] <Strattekun> imo Sombra cant be good in her current iteration, she's way too annoying
[2022-12-19 16:43:59] <%JerryTarantinoo> sombra is fucking aids to play against when shes meta
[2022-12-19 16:44:05] <%JerryTarantinoo> game is so shit when shes meta
[2022-12-19 16:44:06] <0fficer_toaster> I did have a few great games with Junker Queen over the weekend,   I actually went 26 n 2 against a Road Hog player.
[2022-12-19 16:44:06] <LizOpTwitch> How are tank queue’s rn?

[2022-12-19 16:44:31] <broccolienjoyer4444444> sombra was reworked a few times already i think
[2022-12-19 16:44:37] <+Dekenizer> @nobara_jjkai Sombra is a high skill char... In my low ranks they are terrible.... but good in higher
[2022-12-19 16:44:39] <%$smokyrosettv> junker queen and ana combo, ana can constantly bait cleanse til jq ults
[2022-12-19 16:44:42] <+Phoenixx_Right> first season was miserable with sombra sojourn every game
[2022-12-19 16:44:44] <$imhutzelman> If sombra gets to good they’ll have to nerf genji
[2022-12-19 16:44:52] <@%^StreamElements> Everyone should join Emongg's discord! emongEZ https://discord.gg/emongg
[2022-12-19 16:44:56] <Strattekun> I'd rather Sombra had more direct combat utility with a teleport rather than the ganker that murders you instantly

[2022-12-19 16:48:04] <fireblazewolf420> my strategy when playing sombra is gather intel on where the enemy is by pinging them and mainly focusing on pinging the supports. and hacking high priority targets.

[2022-12-19 17:21:21] <$sakasaki> hog gets buffed but the only change is a visible six-pack through his fat layer
[2022-12-19 17:21:22] <ertyutrw> relly buff ball pls
[2022-12-19 17:21:26] <ertyutrw> really*
[2022-12-19 17:21:27] <%+ZeoBishop> sounds balanced
[2022-12-19 17:21:33] <%+plushcap> they should buff hook so that it hooks everyone in radius YEP
[2022-12-19 17:21:36] <godzillajj24> hog should 1 shot every character
[2022-12-19 17:21:37] <amazatastic> they should make dva have no cool down on boosters she's a flying hero now
[2022-12-19 17:21:37] <KAVE_M4N> Yeah that's sounds okay, but maybe give him a speed buff too, so people can't run away either
[2022-12-19 17:21:38] <%Kusk> The problem with nerfing hog's one-shot ability is that then no one will play him

[2022-12-19 21:03:53] <@%^StreamElements> If you're noticing ads at unfortunate times, Twitch now requires all streams to run ads at set intervals. We're not triggering them, they're on Twitch's end and out of our control.
[2022-12-19 21:04:14] <%faultysaeg> @sl4tmilk You have to claim the spray to start progress on the skin. So long as you claimed it you should be good.
[2022-12-19 21:04:15] <%TheNastyFridge> @sl4tmilk Should work, yes
[2022-12-19 21:04:20] <OooldG> @sl4tmilk you need to claim each drop individually to get the next one
[2022-12-19 21:04:21] <%Cream8Derp> @sl4tmilk That's bc you need to claim your drop before you get progress on the next thing

[2022-12-19 21:43:57] <%blondejohn96> lutefisk was first invented by great grandpappy sven, son of olaf. he discovered the delightful treat when he accidentally spilled drain cleaner on some salt cod. he didnt want to eat it, but great uncle olaf, son of sven, double reindeer dared him to eat it, so he tried and discovered the delicacy. he then passed it down to his eldest son johan, son of sven, who spread it all about the swedish countryside

[2022-12-19 23:41:09] <+Ericratz> they couldnt push in because of lava
[2022-12-19 23:41:11] <hydruxo> team didn't follow up tbh
[2022-12-19 23:41:14] <tmjoon> see in raplay
[2022-12-19 23:41:22] <+ogsupremehypebeast> How to nerf Roadhog: decrease the radius of his hook. Half the damage mitigation during healing. The character is the same, fundamentally, but the skill floor rises. The one shot potential is still there but it is less frequently hit. During retreat, he is more vulnerable and can easily be out muscled.
[2022-12-19 23:41:27] <%dapdude25> @xx_m3m3_m4chine_420_69_xx Yeah I know, so wild that that gets you banned.
[2022-12-19 23:41:27] <%7thSea> I said jay3 was a stupid idiot and that he sucks at the game and he just banned me :(

[2022-12-19 23:41:57] <%blondejohn96> i just called him a trash ass thrower like 6 or 7 times and then i got banned out of nowhere for no reason :(
