[2022-12-20 00:14:20] <@%Kuroz> cause the wa basically tells when there's less than a sec left on spell cast combined with quaking, I remember adjusting it for sylvanas, so probably doesn't work with tranq

[2022-12-20 22:57:54] <+LtJenkins> Starting a guild with the purpose of raiding would be a great place to start. It is very difficult though. Even for experienced guilds. Keeping 20 people together week after week is like trying to hold water a lot of the times @ow_kaden
