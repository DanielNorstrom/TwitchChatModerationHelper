[2022-12-19 08:16:43] <1s4c10> If 1+1 = 2 than 2+2 = 4 it should turn out like 4+4= 8 so that means 8+8= 16 and 16+16= 32 theoretically 32+32 should be 64, 64+64= 128. 128+128= 256. So now when we figured that out it should mean that 256+256 equals 1

I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink.

[2022-12-19 12:21:45] <Hollow_void> @nnniikaaaa Nah widow is fine, she should be rewarded for headshots they are not easy to get for avrage players.
[2022-12-19 12:21:51] <%CrunchyDee> Rotating meta is a valid game mechanic. There is no perfectly balanced game when every character is designed to be unique.
