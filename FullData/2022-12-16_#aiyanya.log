[2022-12-16 10:24:05] <%+HoboRobo130> the lightning strike itself is just visual. but when the lightning debuff explodes it drops a puddle around you that will kill anyone else in it
[2022-12-16 10:24:49] <%+HoboRobo130> ok yeah, it's the same as nael phase in ucob. the lightning strike is a visual indicator that you get the debuff
[2022-12-16 10:24:59] <%+HoboRobo130> then when the debuff expires you explode

[2022-12-16 12:48:52] <@%Dark_Fable> Hmm people are speculating the girl, named Riko, will be Ash's future daughter. "She doesn't talk much about her family to those around her and refuses to give her family name to anyone except the campus professors"
[2022-12-16 12:48:59] <WarriorOfLight27> man this raid is so hard
[2022-12-16 12:49:04] <WarriorOfLight27> is it the hardest

[2022-12-16 12:49:23] <%+mattyojama> it's also the only relevant one so you actually have to worry about dps here
