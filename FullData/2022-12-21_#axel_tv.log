[2022-12-21 16:43:47] <ghostedghost1> style yea but eh it's tarkov and bsgs decision

[2022-12-21 16:43:56] <+hydarrr> its confirmed, that wipe wont be tomorrow ?:(
[2022-12-21 16:43:58] <bikez__> What up, how are the raids
[2022-12-21 16:44:01] <%scavcatuwu> @Qweets what i should play?
[2022-12-21 16:44:06] <%Ahcenton> @Axel_tv I got lost so streets of tarkov this year with new bosses or without?
[2022-12-21 16:44:15] <ghostedghost1> @wims80 yes it is
[2022-12-21 16:44:18] <wims80> i suppose it doesnt really matter if the helmet is armor class 3 or 4, everything will pen anyways
[2022-12-21 16:44:22] <%Qweets> @scavcatuwu probably customs

[2022-12-21 16:44:40] <ghostedghost1> we will get streets but no bosses
[2022-12-21 16:44:58] <+hydarrr> saaaaaaaaad, guess my hype about wipe will be then over again before the wipe starts
[2022-12-21 16:45:02] <semchev> "streets" coming out, as in a small sections of it, which is really just equivalent to adding any new map. waiting for them to also say "and it will also start with 10-11 pmcs and more will be added"
[2022-12-21 16:45:03] <%Ahcenton> ohh thanks
[2022-12-21 16:45:05] <bikez__> it was weird we havent got a pic today

[2022-12-21 16:45:29] <%cwissttv> there is currently 15 stims that you can barter for (with the event) obdolbos gives you +20, so minus 20 gives us 5, wipe in 5 days

[2022-12-21 16:45:43] <ShadowAlex1200> Is the 7.62x51 MDR better than the 7.62x51 Scar ?
[2022-12-21 16:45:45] <%Ahcenton> So the bsg didn't make it in time with new bosses?
[2022-12-21 16:45:48] <ghostedghost1> not on Christmas because they no like Christmas wipes

[2022-12-21 16:49:48] <%Caskey> I just never expect anything new tbh
[2022-12-21 16:49:50] <!%+NoiceGuy> Also they haven't confirmed streets will be in this patch
[2022-12-21 16:49:51] VIEWERS: 337
[2022-12-21 16:50:00] <%Ahcenton> Axel but even if streets of tarkov come out there is still terminal , town etc
[2022-12-21 16:50:02] <!%+NoiceGuy> They just do weird shit
[2022-12-21 16:50:05] <NYMBO_> wipe is not tomorrow? whyyyy
[2022-12-21 16:50:09] <%Caskey> I thought arena woulda been out
[2022-12-21 16:50:11] <dmvdie> spoiler, next wipe there will be a female character LUL
[2022-12-21 16:50:15] <ghostedghost1> tfw bsg say streets this year but not in patch WutFace
[2022-12-21 16:50:28] <%+xaveir> arena or axeltvRIOT
[2022-12-21 16:50:30] <%cwissttv> it would end really bad
[2022-12-21 16:50:33] <+Destroy3rDrew> what is today's event?
[2022-12-21 16:50:33] <!%+NoiceGuy> Streets will be there 100%

[2022-12-21 16:50:41] <NYMBO_> did they say when wipe is ?
[2022-12-21 16:50:42] <!%+NoiceGuy> but they haven't said it word for word yet

[2022-12-21 16:51:30] <ghostedghost1> bsg is doing the funny
[2022-12-21 16:51:31] <%+ChiefBeefOfficial> it wouldn’t make sense for them not to include streets if they are completely reworking quests
[2022-12-21 16:51:36] <%HazardwasteQc> Then again, I think bsg is the trolliest company ever, nothing suprises me anymore
[2022-12-21 16:51:45] <Wulfgar_RED> Imagine upgrading your PC for this wipe in anticipation of streets. People do this...
[2022-12-21 16:51:48] <semchev> "sorry we tried our best here is in-game trader instead that we promised a long time ago"
[2022-12-21 16:51:49] <+shnatzjr> i say they should do wipe events for the next month, its the best time to play imo
[2022-12-21 16:51:51] VIEWERS: 337

[2022-12-21 16:52:34] <%+ChiefBeefOfficial> pretty sure it was confirmed that quests are going to be completely new this up coming wipe
[2022-12-21 16:52:36] <@%ImSoBurr_> @ghostedghost1 I bet him $100 that streets won't come out til 2024

[2022-12-21 16:53:14] <ghostedghost1> it's technically not a rework
[2022-12-21 16:53:15] <Wulfgar_RED> How would DLC work. Slit player base?

[2022-12-21 16:54:02] <%18Cass> is bsg, we can expect anything from them
[2022-12-21 16:54:02] <ghostedghost1> @fr0inkish that's a theory we all know bsg loves fucking with us
[2022-12-21 16:54:07] <+voelker27> why is the assumption that a wipe is imminent anyways?
[2022-12-21 16:54:10] <%fr0inkish> @ghostedghost1 exactly

[2022-12-21 16:57:42] <temerityx_> flea market would go to shit tho
[2022-12-21 16:57:44] <InteSalty> only ever bought by the casuals
[2022-12-21 16:57:47] <!%+NoiceGuy> Everyone knows what happens when you turn on cheats for a citybuilder game or creative for minecraft. You have a great time for a couple weeks maybe then stop. Because there's nothing to accomplish anymore.
[2022-12-21 16:57:47] <+Crazy_N3wf> rmt sites used to be 3 - 6 for one mill
[2022-12-21 16:57:55] <%scavcatuwu> hell nah 40$ too expensive you can make 1mil in like 2 raids
[2022-12-21 16:57:55] <%$kiris95> paying for pixels that will disappear with the wipe

[2022-12-21 16:58:02] <@%ImSoBurr_> I just want an acct that I can pay $400 for that starts me at lvl 42 so I can skip quests
[2022-12-21 16:58:04] <+shnatzjr> the real question, can i exchange rubles for dollars
[2022-12-21 16:58:05] <+voelker27> if you play the game to get where rubles ACTUALLY matter, then it would be dumb to purchase rubles
[2022-12-21 16:58:09] <%Ahcenton> 1$ equal 165 roubles
[2022-12-21 16:58:09] <%Qweets> @Crazy_N3wf why do you know that?
[2022-12-21 16:58:30] <ghostedghost1> @noiceguy ahuh:>
[2022-12-21 16:58:49] <+shnatzjr> yeah im sick of it.
[2022-12-21 16:58:53] <pyrorodgers> the 500 shoreline quest are such  a pain
[2022-12-21 16:58:53] <@%ImSoBurr_> yeap, can't be bothered anymore, I do them just to get to max traders as fast as possible so I can actually play the game.

[2022-12-21 16:59:22] <wims80> jaeger quests are the worst
[2022-12-21 16:59:37] <%Qweets> @Crazy_N3wf Sure you're not buying roubles? lol

[2022-12-21 16:59:45] <semchev> the majority of quests are play the loot slot machine until you get specific random items
[2022-12-21 16:59:48] <%Seriiozha> Tarkov's biggest problem is and will be no competition! This game is monoploly in genre. Yes there is games which tried to copy mechanics but they not even close. Thats why BSG is lazy

[2022-12-21 17:10:14] <DeepSpaceWanderer> @ghostedghost1 fair enough. but i would say these events make trader discounts a more likely event, not less (why would you give players the ability to relatively easily get max traders and max skills/weapon masteries if you then wouldn't let them cheaply play with all the high level gear?

[2022-12-21 17:47:09] <%$Xv_Ruckus_vX> They haven’t done max trader unlock or 1 rouble event yet so wipe isn’t until probably Thursday next week
[2022-12-21 17:47:15] <@%727life> 3d cache is what helps the cpu preform so well in tarky and rust. I've seen people wit 150-200 fps in rust it's nutty

[2022-12-21 17:59:10] <TheEmptyTV> @everlast_ no, it will take way too much time to convert all the C# to C++ and assetts
[2022-12-21 17:59:12] <@%727life> @everlast_ they would have to rewrite the whole game
[2022-12-21 17:59:16] <+Le_Coyote91> no matter your gpu ;)
[2022-12-21 17:59:23] <+Le_Coyote91> i got 3080
[2022-12-21 17:59:24] <%+FusN> 2k monitor is the Sh*t my man, if you can.. Go for it
[2022-12-21 17:59:31] <everlast_> tru that monkaHmm
[2022-12-21 17:59:37] <chops_games> @Axel_tv how do you like the 4080 by the way? i dont think i was here when you mightve talked about it
[2022-12-21 17:59:38] <+Le_Coyote91> and gain 30 ips when switch 1080
[2022-12-21 17:59:52] <+Le_Coyote91> yes fps
[2022-12-21 17:59:52] <%DannyyS_tv> @Axel_tv hey brother
[2022-12-21 17:59:52] <+Le_Coyote91> same
[2022-12-21 17:59:57] <isoldier46i> Its like the 4080 so strong that it cant be pressured to 99% in tarkov without 3d cash. And then still. he wont lose FPS cuz it runs on 20% OMEGALUL
[2022-12-21 17:59:57] <@%727life> Also Unreal doesn't offer the same customability that Unity does and that's a lot of why BSG went with Unity Nikita said @everlast_

[2022-12-21 18:01:18] <TheEmptyTV> Unity is not that bad, there are actually few interesting games/movies made on unity that looks really well. The main thing is that Unity is not doing anything for you generally, its a tool, you have to use it. Unreal helps a lot in the background with optimalization etc
[2022-12-21 18:01:19] <%$LeGinkgo> More image par seconde haha

[2022-12-21 18:03:03] <TheEmptyTV> @TheEmptyTV yeah + the C# is in my opinion better language for these things. Shame unity uses Mono behind and not the new .net 7, that actually runs pretty fast. That would help too tbh

[2022-12-21 18:04:21] <%mrmisshot> cpu i ment
[2022-12-21 18:04:27] <TheEmptyTV> I mean... I was trying to use DLSS on 2K and it did help with framerate a bit but was unplayable in general, when I scoped (ads) the vision was... pixelated a lot so I could not clearly see
[2022-12-21 18:04:31] <axe_ult> try 1280x960 the game response is like twice FASTER
[2022-12-21 18:04:31] <+Le_Coyote91> i'm hoping for dlss because lighthouse is still not reallly competitive when u play 2k unless having NASA setup
[2022-12-21 18:04:31] <@%727life> @butthustlaaa CPU/ Ram and ram speeds
[2022-12-21 18:04:33] <arkant0zz> if ur GPU not 99% usage ur CPU is in bottleneck

[2022-12-21 18:05:09] <axe_ult> do you use some macro for hold breath ?
[2022-12-21 18:05:10] <ale_barcelos> @butthustlaaa EFT is like Arma 3, because of the AI, AI (bots) need more cpu
[2022-12-21 18:05:13] <TheEmptyTV> @TheEmptyTV Yeah I am planning to dig a bit more to how BSG uses unity, I am really interested in it :D
[2022-12-21 18:05:18] <%ZestyCow> @bobsniffer2 Yes and RAM
[2022-12-21 18:05:23] <arkant0zz> Tarkov is an very CPU heavy game
[2022-12-21 18:05:24] <+Le_Coyote91> @isoldier46i it's better to not run dlss for fps at the moment, since it's up  on EFT actually
[2022-12-21 18:05:26] <vostrapastelka> 3 more FPF for 1,6k is definition on "not worth" .. but you probably use GPU for encoding videos, right?
[2022-12-21 18:05:30] <bobsniffer2> @ZestyCow got it

[2022-12-21 18:10:29] <isoldier46i> @Le_Coyote91 yeah 3900x is really cheap now.  Im thinking about it as well. I need a motherboard as well. I need a cheap but working one. What would you consider for the 3900x?

[2022-12-21 18:10:57] <@%ImSoBurr_> afterburner, asus armory crate, etc
[2022-12-21 18:11:02] <@%727life> @isoldier46i b450m gaming is decently cheap
[2022-12-21 18:11:12] <@%727life> @ImSoBurr_ I only use them for monitoring tbh
[2022-12-21 18:11:18] <isoldier46i> Chat, MSI afterburner with RIVATUNER will help you. You need RivaTuner as well to monitor your fps OMEGALUL

[2022-12-21 18:12:16] <isoldier46i> @Le_Coyote91 im thinking about a used one, if the cpu hasnt been ripped or something a used one should be fine. CPu-s are least that going to break

[2022-12-21 18:13:20] <%HitByBeat> @bobsniffer2 its when you increase the performance of your hardware by allocating more voltage and clock speed to it via either your bios or other apps

[2022-12-21 18:15:51] <isoldier46i> @Le_Coyote91 i mean i do my research. But yeah. I trust used ones. Most of the times its 40% cheaper and works. Maybe no warranty but cpu is the least possibility to break

[2022-12-21 18:24:58] <%qqzar> @Axel_tv Hi Mr Axel <3
[2022-12-21 18:25:12] <kizati> @kizati i got a rx 5500xt gpu tho or does that not matter?
[2022-12-21 18:25:20] <everlast_> we're supposed to get streets before end of year @priestoh
[2022-12-21 18:25:42] <butthustlaaa> Yea I dont know how good I would do at killing raiders lol. I bought the game a little over a month ago. Any tips on killing raiders?
[2022-12-21 18:25:51] <AseterV3> what are the odds they will postpone the wipe till next year due to "technical issues" :tf:
[2022-12-21 18:25:53] <priestoh> @everlast_ yeah sorry I was originally commenting on the guy saying the 25th or 27th. Just thought it would be surprising for them to release it on christmas
[2022-12-21 18:25:58] <arkant0zz> Intel Pentium Dual Core best CPU Tarkov everyone know Kappa
[2022-12-21 18:25:58] <Noduska> @butthustlaaa dont underestimate them...
[2022-12-21 18:26:02] <%+impactblu_> thats the cpu im upgrading to. Have heard nothing but good things about that cpu

[2022-12-21 18:26:59] <@%727life> @Xv_Ruckus_vX haven't seen a single person complain about that so far but could be true
[2022-12-21 18:27:04] <kizati> but yea idk if i got the funds for that
[2022-12-21 18:27:15] <chops_games> @darkvision___ its stressful at first but after that first one, you get addicted. this PC i have right now was my first PC and i built it. 3070ti, Ryzen 9 5900x with 32gb ram. now i want to build another lol
[2022-12-21 18:27:40] <Noduska> @butthustlaaa raiders on which map tho? i dont play reserve or lighthouse. i do play labs tho. basically slow lean peek them and try to go for HS
[2022-12-21 18:27:53] <chops_games> i think applying thermal paste is the most stressfull part @darkvision___
[2022-12-21 18:28:09] <butthustlaaa> I’ve actually never even been to labs. I do t have the gear to play labs

[2022-12-21 18:28:45] <Noduska> @butthustlaaa id reckon its the same for all raiders tho. the slow lean peek thingy
[2022-12-21 18:28:47] <TheEmptyTV> nah, in my humble opinion, the most stresfull part is to sit down he cooler on CPU. I am always so scared the board will crack
[2022-12-21 18:28:52] <%+MrSergo15> The first time I assembled mine it turned on but didn't display anything. Re-assembled and worked fine LUL
[2022-12-21 18:28:54] <@%ImSoBurr_> butthustlaaa sry missed your other message, but for fighting raiders: don't repeek them. they will tap you in the face immediately. Give it a couple seconds before repeeking if you don't kill them on your first peek
[2022-12-21 18:29:05] <butthustlaaa> They rush you though right? After shooting one..

[2022-12-21 18:53:44] <@%^Nightbot> @Axel_tv  Chatters can fight to time each other out for 10 minutes. To start a fight, redeem the 3333 channel point option and @ your opponent. If they accept, both participants say !roll to roll a number. The higher roll wins, and the lower roll gets a time out. Ties are a reroll.

[2022-12-21 19:39:22] <@%mfrayd> maybe i haven't been here in a bit but it looks significantly better
[2022-12-21 19:39:26] <ActivateZeroG> @Massaraksh I see what you meant. Good point
[2022-12-21 19:39:26] <%Massaraksh> @ActivateZeroG there will be no that much of a hype if we know exact date
[2022-12-21 19:39:29] <mysteriussssss> do the events overlap or there is only one at the time ?
[2022-12-21 19:39:33] <tarkovlegend> not removing inertia exactly but like armored rigs on vests, old sights and metas
[2022-12-21 19:39:34] <LifeWatcher_> @Noduska Not likely. We don't have Santa xD
[2022-12-21 19:39:38] <@%727life> it looks better but I meant for others with shit internet @Axel_tv
[2022-12-21 19:39:43] <krispinuggets> im also watching stream in 480 kek

[2022-12-21 19:39:50] <@%727life> It's either 1080p which could cause them buffering issues
[2022-12-21 19:39:51] <@%727life> or 720
[2022-12-21 19:39:51] <tarkovlegend> no black rings on sights would be cool to see again
[2022-12-21 19:40:00] <ActivateZeroG> @Axel_tv Yooo I can see
[2022-12-21 19:40:16] <%Massaraksh> i se no difference

[2022-12-21 19:40:22] <@%727life> you'd be surprised how many people complain about having issues while watching 1080 streams on twitch @Axel_tv

[2022-12-21 19:58:23] <%tronzorb> If you play Tarkov as your primary game, the Ryzen 5800x3D is absurd.
[2022-12-21 19:58:25] <@%727life> it's without a doubt the best cpu for tarkov atm

[2022-12-21 19:59:14] <%tronzorb> @ActivateZeroG I'm not smart enough to explain all the ins and outs but has to do with the 3d cache boosting frames in tarkov by like 30+

[2022-12-21 19:59:41] <@%727life> @xSquadGamingHD tI's not bad but the x3d has 3 times the available cache that the 5800x does which is insanely beneficial in tarkov
[2022-12-21 19:59:47] <%bfcheg> 5800x3d is 350, 5600x is 150
