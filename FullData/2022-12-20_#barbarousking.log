[2022-12-20 01:51:58] <%+Nintenpo> @crunchy93 it's going to be armored core but with more melee options but very true to the old formula
[2022-12-20 01:51:59] <%+lordsynth> @penguinfarm its more than that. they specifically said they werent trying to make it souls like

[2022-12-20 02:02:16] <%+Goreum> I would have preferred a cat walking simulator. the on rails quality of Stray almost entirely removes the fact that you're a cat. the ONE SELLING point completely didn't matter. you might as well have been the robot on the cats back because for all intents and purposes you were. stray was a bad game.
[2022-12-20 02:02:18] <%$Mi4_Slayer> stray almost plays itself, too much auto action shit, it not enough engaging. I like stray but it dosent deserve GOTY indie

[2022-12-20 03:02:18] <%ApogeeRL> speaking of games with good movement, barb should play Prototype sometime.

[2022-12-20 03:07:04] <wariotime1224> what's so bad about Ragnarok?
[2022-12-20 03:07:08] <Oogblad> I feel like some games get praised just for being unique even if they are uniquely trash.

[2022-12-20 03:07:21] <%+kll21> the best thing about the game awards was how horny animal was for melania
[2022-12-20 03:07:21] <%$wishfulthink3r> Metal Hellsinger deserved the best soundtrack award. They were robbed

[2022-12-20 03:07:28] <%kit05> @Beakstore It's just a way to watch game trailers in a less boring fashion than just E3 while seeing a little bit of validation for the things you already like. I don't hate Vampire Survivors now, but it would send a big message if it had on otherwise barbShrug
[2022-12-20 03:07:28] <%$cinemario> didnt give Ragnarok 10/10 so he hates it Sadge
[2022-12-20 03:07:30] <@%$Kindredmsg> I just don't like seeing one game win 10 categories. I'm sorry that just shouldn't happen
[2022-12-20 03:07:35] <%Almar_AZL9S> @wariotime1224 he was disappointed in the story since GOW4 hyped him on the story
[2022-12-20 03:07:40] <%fight_this> eh ragnarok won so many other categories anyway, and elden ring definitely worth goty
[2022-12-20 03:07:41] <%$sloth_moves> i feel like from now on chris judge wont win any awards cause he takes up half the awards with his speaches
[2022-12-20 03:07:42] <%+Rubidium2> Stray won simply because they are hoping the memes will somehow legitimize the Game Awards and turn it into something other than a giant commercial
[2022-12-20 03:07:48] <%Beakstore> @kit05 I do like the trailers ngl

[2022-12-20 03:08:12] <%$wampasaurus> Its so strange since Elden Ring was really the first BIG game to come out since the covid lockdowns, it was further enhanced as an almost catharsis to gaming and game development getting back to normal IMO

[2022-12-20 03:09:04] <%$sloth_moves> they should have updated more in gow ragnorok, it was the same game with shittier story

[2022-12-20 15:29:17] <%+zenqueeen> @drkirienko yea its weird the scabs will pull the ink out if you pick them off before it settles

[2022-12-20 15:29:23] <%$trizgo> @drkirienko scratching a fresh tattoo can absolutely pull the ink out, because it is a fresh wound that has ink underneath it
[2022-12-20 15:29:25] <%+zenqueeen> no touchy
[2022-12-20 15:29:26] <%Lunaphire> @drkirienko It's because you can scratch off the scabs and then the ink is paler later
[2022-12-20 15:29:30] <%Rosisson> drkirienko the scab is connected to the blood, it's scientifically backed (also tofu used to be a tattoo artist proffesionally he knows about it)

[2022-12-20 16:09:57] <%+Sorry4HavingFun> Its like Tarkov, you get put in a dungeon with enemies and other players who can attack you. You try to get loot and escape
[2022-12-20 16:10:00] <%DoctorBalboa> I watched a few mins of it. It’s like Skyrim + rust? It’s a “fps” dungeon type game. It’s having a test play right now it’s not set to release til next year

[2022-12-20 16:34:05] <%flipvanmorritz> It's like, I remember when virtua fighter and tekken first came out, I thought they looked like dogshit compared to the art of SF2, but they were "3D"
[2022-12-20 16:34:07] <%A_Benjineer> The N64 is actually more powerful than the PS1, Nintendo just didn't let 3rd party developers have access to the coding that would have let them take advantage of it.

[2022-12-20 16:34:34] <%+xImNotToast> There was more focus on 3D than gameplay
[2022-12-20 16:34:38] <%+seedmole> a lack of coherent control schemes was a big problem

[2022-12-20 16:34:42] <%$GreenFerret95> did N64 have any 2d games?
[2022-12-20 16:34:44] <%$sloth_moves> i feel like next time you do a 24 hour you should include a link to the steam page so we can see and read about the different games
[2022-12-20 16:34:44] <BaggageID> 3d frame rate?
[2022-12-20 16:34:44] <%+LaLiLupin> there were so many tricks to make it work back then. 3D had sooo many optimizations since the 90s and even early 00s

[2022-12-20 16:34:57] <%+XLVIItheRoman> it was a weird time. things that should have been 2D were 3D, and vice versa

[2022-12-20 16:35:14] <%WestonianB> That infamous gaming mag preview that trashed SotN while praising Castlevania 64 for embracing 3D
[2022-12-20 16:35:15] <%dream_the_cast> yeah, 3d games without dual analogue sticks so you'd look up with the bumpers and stuff
[2022-12-20 16:35:18] <%flipvanmorritz> I'll insist that Alone in the Dark and Virtua Fighter were the worst offenders early on
[2022-12-20 16:35:19] <%$BytePorter> saturn had great 2D but welp

[2022-12-20 18:23:27] <@%$DanTheVP> @opfazonk I do take issue in general with random people thinking there is always some bright line between Dev/Publishing. Plenty Publishers utilize Dev resources when they publish titles.
[2022-12-20 18:23:30] <Vyrlokar> @eatingpotatoes25 Oh yeah, but it doesn't mean I don't miss Torment ;)
[2022-12-20 18:23:31] <%hoodlumroyalty> this whole game is a bit silly, yeah? it seems aware of itself
