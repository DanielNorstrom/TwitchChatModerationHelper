[2023-01-05 16:44:20] <JTTheGreatSchism> @themoongoat so a 1 percent stop loss takes the value you purchased it at. And follows it. If it drops a percentage point below what you bought it at, it’ll auto sell at a loss to stop the loss. But if you trail the stop loss it’ll follow to top value and sell the minute it drops 1% from the new top.

[2023-01-05 16:44:56] <Redphone34> @TheMoonGoat no, but % of value is also a function you can use in tandem to prevent losing too much money from your initial entry point if it's going down instead of up.
[2023-01-05 16:45:11] <%nothingbutcome> ZxinFrenzy theres a lot less liquidity as well so you can't really make market orders and stuff or you'll get terrible fills

[2023-01-05 19:05:45] <%dollarcheeseburger> The Speaker of the House in the US is not legally required to be an elected member of the House. For example, recently Rep. Jim Cooper (TN-5) suggested Colin Powell for the role. Given that, are there any legal limitations on holding the position? I mean, could the House select just any random person? A child? A non-citizen? Would there be limits on holding a job for two branches of government at once?

Theres a high risk with their variable debts, but people need power and rates increase. It dropped from expected divy cut, but a cut i feel at this level would be positive.
