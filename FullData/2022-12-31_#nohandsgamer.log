[2022-12-31 02:59:50] <Tolstoievski> @matmarex You can do that pretty consistently
[2022-12-31 02:59:58] <+jakethezipper> How often do you want to be playing your warbrands when you don't have something to sinful brand? Do you ever want to save them for sinful brand or are the 1/1s on board meaningful?
[2022-12-31 02:59:58] <!%pocket_train> I agree the meta is a bit too fast btw, but not by much. My main point is I much prefer this too Renathal
[2022-12-31 03:00:05] <greggirs> Merry Christmas here’s your shit meta
[2022-12-31 03:00:12] <+chuuwire> Instant gratification turn 5 3 minute games is fun Kappa
[2022-12-31 03:00:26] <%+walrus027> better than yugioh at least you get to turn 5
[2022-12-31 03:00:33] <!%pocket_train> This meta is perfect then, there's something for everyone
[2022-12-31 03:00:35] <+piecell> Yeah I think rogue and DH should be toned down again, but, the meta is pretty good no cap
[2022-12-31 03:00:42] <%matmarex> @matmarex i hope that at least this deck is worse than the usual quest DH if you don't draw the combo LUL
[2022-12-31 03:00:44] <%Kinchmind> you could make something to show the degeneracy, forcing a change
[2022-12-31 03:00:44] <+piecell> Legend is just abusing the popular stuff
[2022-12-31 03:00:45] <%+Xeath5> isnt this the worst meta for pocket182PockChamp ? I remember him saying he hates the renathal animation cuz it takes so much time... now he has to watch the scythe animation Kappa
[2022-12-31 03:00:48] <greggirs> Yea shitting on meta is fun
[2022-12-31 03:00:48] <khuchten> any meta without midrange presense is garbage
[2022-12-31 03:00:50] <%Kinchmind> but complaining is easier
[2022-12-31 03:00:55] <%+TheSphinx1906> If Renny means 30min control games, I'll take too fast...but would prefer it to be slower...
[2022-12-31 03:01:02] <+chuuwire> @walrus027 KEKW When you quit yugioh for hearthstone cuz it was slower and now you die turn 5 YEP

[2022-12-31 03:38:45] <%+Xeath5> ofc the rogue deck is nice
[2022-12-31 03:38:51] <%+Xeath5> but we need other classes to get some good stuff too
[2022-12-31 03:38:57] <skywalkeradam1453> One of the problems right now I think is how much draw rogue and DH have. You like consistently draw your entire deck by turn 6 or 7
[2022-12-31 03:39:07] <+Mungo4u> they're going to nerf the quest

[2022-12-31 04:22:51] <khuchten> you would have beaten rogue but because warrior op, you lost
[2022-12-31 04:22:53] <IcyMcSp1cy> if you discovered arcanist instead of abusive, you would've had enough mana for 2nd fel barrage

[2022-12-31 04:24:27] <%+Darkthunder119> they did the same to deathrattle rogue, not just 1 nerf, multiple nerfs to kill the deck
[2022-12-31 04:24:29] <+zeemk> Even aggro was fun during sunken had a great time playing pirate rouge
[2022-12-31 04:24:46] <XFuriX> bad thing about nerfs is it kills variety
[2022-12-31 04:24:52] <owain1607> spitelash was fun
[2022-12-31 04:25:03] <lightfreeze_hs> i dislike that they said that burn from hand is unfun, then we have a meta with astalor, this and frost dk
[2022-12-31 04:25:11] <amaxagon> nerfs don't always kill variety if there is an oppressive deck shaping the meta

[2022-12-31 04:26:54] <grimBleeper> Sadge he's right
[2022-12-31 04:26:56] <khuchten> there hasn't been S tier oppressive deck in meta for long long time, probably 2 years at least but that doesn't stop blizzard from killing decks left and right
[2022-12-31 04:27:00] <+zeemk> Yeah I hate how value decks are pretty much dead right now been coping by playing battlecry shaman
[2022-12-31 04:27:24] <boynissi> but it's 5 mana draw 4 tho, they spend on potion belt
[2022-12-31 04:27:39] <%+Darkthunder119> interesting point u have there. what if they have 1 team for each: control, aggro and combo KEKW
[2022-12-31 04:27:41] <grimBleeper> Kappa what if blizzard's internal playtesting has a secret op warrior deck that we haven't discovered
[2022-12-31 04:27:48] <Akaryn87> we see our first turn 7 today PogChamp PogChamp
[2022-12-31 04:27:50] <Darwal> @boynissi not when you prep the belt and alchemist the potion, 2 mana for all that
[2022-12-31 04:27:52] <ogbangaz> Is astalor from this expansion?
[2022-12-31 04:27:54] <lightfreeze_hs> @zeemk funny thing in every other meta where you are not dead by turn 7 , oldie shaman is still pretty viable
[2022-12-31 04:27:54] <JakeTheDoggo_> Why can DH have a 1 mana lifesteal AOE that deals damage to the face but hunter can't target face to draw 2 miserable cards KEKW
[2022-12-31 04:27:59] <feduco94> but warrior likes having taunt cards
[2022-12-31 04:28:04] <ScarecrowCR> everyone complained about the power creep so Blizz took action and did all the correction in warrior lol

[2022-12-31 04:28:23] <curtarc> The team that works on Warrior must have worked on Shaman this expansion as well. Cracks me up that they made that spell 10 mana. I mean, it's not even good at 8.
[2022-12-31 04:28:51] <%+Xeath5> remember when rogue and dh had too much mana cheat so they made the first cap on mana cheat on a warrior card KEKW
[2022-12-31 04:28:55] <+zeemk> @lightfreeze_hs it still is viable rn i have a 65% wr over like 50 games in top 500
[2022-12-31 04:29:44] <+helix_sky> what happens in other card games, like i know MtG isnt the same but i dont hear them nerf cards left and right or are they
[2022-12-31 04:29:56] <+zeemk> @lightfreeze_hs Its just a little more tempo focused than the old lists still has a little value though

[2022-12-31 08:39:46] <Fennicks47> it doub les the first half, not the second right
[2022-12-31 08:39:47] <snorbi123> @jerry_34_ fair
[2022-12-31 08:39:57] <Fennicks47> so its 8x2 + 8, so 24 per astalor
[2022-12-31 08:40:01] <%+PineappleTrainWreck> it's 69, chat dont be dumb
[2022-12-31 08:40:44] <snorbi123> its 32 per astalor because it the manathirst buffs the battlecry to 16, so it doubles with brann
[2022-12-31 08:41:04] <Fennicks47> the manathirst part doesnt get copied right
[2022-12-31 08:41:10] <Fennicks47> there was a whole discussion on this

[2022-12-31 08:41:30] <Fennicks47> only  the 8 drop
[2022-12-31 08:41:32] <Fennicks47> ?
[2022-12-31 08:41:38] <snorbi123> only the 8 drop

[2022-12-31 08:41:47] <MierinEronaile> the manathirst does not get copied on 2 mana astalor because that's the battlecry, the manathirst on 8 mana astalor does because it changes the battllecry

[2022-12-31 23:45:09] <%+The_monster_hunter> I get that sometimes too. Like I should be working towards something larger but I don't have the desire or the need really.
[2022-12-31 23:45:12] <%JonsyBones> You either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the rogue
[2022-12-31 23:45:16] <+chuuwire> nearing 30, i can relate to that feeling

[2022-12-31 23:46:56] <picopoker> life's meta can be sumed up in two words: don't starve
[2022-12-31 23:47:18] <+chuuwire> I think we need sucky people in our lives to maintain the balance of the matrix code

[2022-12-31 23:49:02] <+Hepadz> Brasil starving matchup is pretty hard
[2022-12-31 23:49:16] <%JonsyBones> Obesity is a metabreaker
[2022-12-31 23:49:19] <jjrodriguezmayo> here in Cuba is hard not to starve

[2022-12-31 23:50:33] <AcezWild> americans very favored vs starving, deck is very greedy though
[2022-12-31 23:50:40] <+Ninjamonkcy> Your opponent is having a pretty insane curve

[2022-12-31 23:51:27] <chapeludo1> did dh got nerfed or something? it feels like you could really speedrun with dh
[2022-12-31 23:51:52] <jjrodriguezmayo> this deck is not that ez
[2022-12-31 23:51:57] <%davesillygoose> New Year Day is the day of reflection, and I think that we have a shitty year. Covid never left, Russia started a war, US started a global recession, and worst of all, Andrew Tate got arrested and I almost purchased a tequila bottle from the Kadasian. I also got fired, got new job and lost 50k in stocks.
[2022-12-31 23:51:58] <%+The_monster_hunter> I think tooth is clunky in this list

[2022-12-31 23:52:58] <%+The_monster_hunter> Yeah Tates fate is the worst thign that happeneD this year KEKW
[2022-12-31 23:53:20] <tromic> didnt even get to party with andrew tate, 2023 is doomed
[2022-12-31 23:54:01] <%+Mr_M0jo> 30 days in a Romanian jail, what's the worst that could happen?
[2022-12-31 23:54:01] <%+Xeath5> that tate story was awesome... people really believed they arrested him cuz he ordered some pizza... like it was some bad movie from 1960 KEKW
[2022-12-31 23:54:06] <jjrodriguezmayo> how is andrew tate?
[2022-12-31 23:54:36] <%+Mr_M0jo> he's detained

[2022-12-31 23:54:59] <+chuuwire> guy from the future here: control warrior is tier 1 again in 2023, and rogue and dh are rotated out of standard thus starting a hearthstone revolution
[2022-12-31 23:55:29] <%davesillygoose> @mr_m0jo you have not been to Romania jails. There are gipsy voodos.
[2022-12-31 23:55:35] <huntstv> hey how's it going
[2022-12-31 23:55:37] <%+Xeath5> i think the only reason people thought some pizza had something to do with is cuz its east europe ... they think the police is like 3Head there
[2022-12-31 23:55:56] <huntstv> is the new shockspitter hunter that good now? I've been away frrom HS and just playing POE
[2022-12-31 23:56:11] <umjev> no they believed the pizza thing cause it was funny
[2022-12-31 23:56:14] <%JonsyBones> It's more like people were clowning on him cause he's a massive clown
[2022-12-31 23:56:26] <huntstv> ah
[2022-12-31 23:56:29] <+dickard27> its no quest DH thats for sure
[2022-12-31 23:56:30] <%+Mr_M0jo> everyone sucks at trying something new
[2022-12-31 23:56:31] <%+Xeath5> dont think that was funny :o
[2022-12-31 23:56:33] <tromic> @Xeath5 well people do believe that the only reason the romanian police went after him is because he openly said it was easy to do corruption in the country xd
[2022-12-31 23:56:40] <jjrodriguezmayo> @huntstv is good but not in high legend vs dh and rogue
[2022-12-31 23:56:43] <huntstv> am I going to have to finally learn how to play DH? lol

[2022-12-31 23:57:21] <huntstv> everything about him is stupid
[2022-12-31 23:57:21] <umjev> @xeath5 how is a large public figure getting arrested over twitter beef not a funny idea
[2022-12-31 23:57:22] <bob_the69th> HAPPY NEW YEAR GUYS!
[2022-12-31 23:57:28] <%+Xeath5> maybe he payed the police to go visit him so he is all over the news
[2022-12-31 23:57:30] <noway_hs> fordaOhYeah fordaOhYeah
[2022-12-31 23:57:30] <%+Xeath5> who knows KEKW
[2022-12-31 23:57:32] <+Crispymayhem> It was a self-fulfilling prophecy.
[2022-12-31 23:57:40] <%+The_monster_hunter> no one ever said he was smart
[2022-12-31 23:57:42] <+chuuwire> @bob_the69th happy new year!
[2022-12-31 23:57:46] <%+Mr_M0jo> Greta dropped a dime
[2022-12-31 23:57:54] <%JonsyBones> Personally I think he got arrested for his cringy response to getting publically dunked on
[2022-12-31 23:57:58] <%+Xeath5> @umjev idk im a rather logical person
[2022-12-31 23:58:00] <khuchten> These kind of people are addicted to attention

[2022-12-31 23:59:54] <%JonsyBones> Honestly this is karma for playing rogue
[2022-12-31 23:59:56] <dendaihs> There are plenty of oil tycoons who probably do some shady stuff but stay quiet and are fine
[2022-12-31 23:59:59] <%davesillygoose> I thought that if you make fake money, you need to tell everybody about it to invest into your scheme. #crypto #mattdeamon
