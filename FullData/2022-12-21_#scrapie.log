[2022-12-21 15:59:46] <%bpwnz> poor people are sketchy
[2022-12-21 16:00:00] <+5boringgames> what skid colour those scrapie use, those his change colour if he is in a SD?
[2022-12-21 16:00:02] <!%judozwerg> bpwnz I'm not partaking in such strange things as "bits"
[2022-12-21 16:00:08] <!%judozwerg> The only currency I trust are KEKW points
[2022-12-21 16:00:13] <!%Marshad0w0> why scwapie cant post it some where else that he is not streaming Sadge
[2022-12-21 16:00:18] <%bpwnz> exactly what a poor person would say judo.

[2022-12-21 16:00:36] <!%judozwerg> I would ask in the discord 5boringgames, I have no idea

[2022-12-21 16:01:14] <!%judozwerg> true
[2022-12-21 16:01:42] <%bpwnz> I'm guessing there's like 100 xmas maps
[2022-12-21 16:02:00] <%bpwnz> if he spends just 5 minutes each on them it's going to be a 10 hour stream
[2022-12-21 16:02:24] <!%judozwerg> He already said
[2022-12-21 16:02:29] <!%judozwerg> 8-9h stream or something tomorrow xdd
[2022-12-21 16:02:35] <%bpwnz> Perfect
[2022-12-21 16:02:46] <%bpwnz> even though I know my map is going to happen while I'm in a meeting

[2022-12-21 16:08:30] <%bpwnz> everyone should make maps. it's only hard if you're aiming to make a good map.
[2022-12-21 16:08:51] <%bpwnz> well everyone but judo. If you've played his maps you know he should uninstall.
