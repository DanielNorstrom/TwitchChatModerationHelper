[2023-01-06 10:42:06] <leukoc1> @julliant nah i mean like meme wise if you look at the steam store. indie devs have been pushing alot of open world crafting survival games.. but its probably because the tech has developed to the level where most ppl can play it reasonably well

[2023-01-06 10:56:00] <!%xrossdelta> why did cloud wear buster sword different way compare to zack and angeal
[2023-01-06 10:56:18] <!%xrossdelta> whats the backstory Thinkge
[2023-01-06 10:56:28] <@%julliant> well the real reason is the games are made at different times by slightly different teams
[2023-01-06 10:56:29] <!%xrossdelta> surely it meant something right
[2023-01-06 10:56:36] <%$NinjaMuffinTV> Shirley
[2023-01-06 10:56:43] <!%xrossdelta> but its very obvious
[2023-01-06 10:56:48] <!%xrossdelta> so i always thought it meants omething
[2023-01-06 10:57:01] <%YeeeeHeeeeCeeee> HUHH
[2023-01-06 10:57:09] <@%julliant> cloud's posture and everything is an amalgamation of several things
[2023-01-06 10:57:09] <%YeeeeHeeeeCeeee> I saw some cursed shit
[2023-01-06 10:57:12] <%$NinjaMuffinTV> Well cloud just isnt properly trained with the buster sword right?

[2023-01-06 11:22:47] <!%xrossdelta> gunblade are literally gunas blad
[2023-01-06 11:22:48] <@%julliant> Gunblades use blanks to vibrate the blade and cause more damage to the body

[2023-01-06 11:23:20] <%$NinjaMuffinTV> Well gunblades in FF13 are just guns and swords in one weapon
[2023-01-06 11:23:21] <!%xrossdelta> chainsaw = gunblade
[2023-01-06 11:23:23] <!%xrossdelta> NOTED

[2023-01-06 11:23:44] <!%xrossdelta> i still feel reluctant to finish ff13
[2023-01-06 11:23:50] <%darkbiacksnow> ff13 is ResidentSleeper

[2023-01-06 11:23:57] <%darkbiacksnow> that game is flawed design wise
[2023-01-06 11:24:01] <@%julliant> A good axe or spear is still the best melee weapon
[2023-01-06 11:24:01] <!%xrossdelta> but idk the story pepeW me
[2023-01-06 11:24:06] <!%Yolovsky> I got 100% achievements on ff13 and ff13-2 xdd
[2023-01-06 11:24:10] <!%xrossdelta> and some gameplay part
[2023-01-06 11:24:14] <!%Yolovsky> I kinda like the game
[2023-01-06 11:24:16] <%darkbiacksnow> I tried multiple times to play ff13
[2023-01-06 11:24:17] <!%xrossdelta> but so many cool aspectts
[2023-01-06 11:24:17] <cartoonsen> almost there...
[2023-01-06 11:24:18] <!%xrossdelta> idk why
[2023-01-06 11:24:22] <%darkbiacksnow> I keep getting ResidentSleeper
[2023-01-06 11:24:25] <!%xrossdelta> same
[2023-01-06 11:24:36] <%darkbiacksnow> xrossdelta there was a post explaining the bad design of ff13 before
[2023-01-06 11:24:40] <!%xrossdelta> its like everything in it is either so WICKED or so ResidentSleeper
[2023-01-06 11:24:42] <%$NinjaMuffinTV> people bashed ff13 so much for being a hallway simulator but ffx had about the same amount of hallways
[2023-01-06 11:24:43] <!%xrossdelta> nothing in between
[2023-01-06 11:24:45] <FateGasm> lightning though forsenCoomer
[2023-01-06 11:24:48] <@%$wTone_> 7 minutes YEPP
[2023-01-06 11:24:48] <%darkbiacksnow> it was that you don't actually have command of what happens in the game
[2023-01-06 11:25:02] <skadiskida> StillWaiting
[2023-01-06 11:25:08] <%darkbiacksnow> you just go from point A to B
[2023-01-06 11:25:09] <!%xrossdelta> oh yea if u put it that way
[2023-01-06 11:25:09] <%darkbiacksnow> nothing else
[2023-01-06 11:25:12] <!%xrossdelta> it kinda felt that
[2023-01-06 11:25:17] <!%Yolovsky> if party leader dies = game over is stupid design
[2023-01-06 11:25:21] <!%xrossdelta> but ff12 kinda similar in a way
[2023-01-06 11:25:27] <!%xrossdelta> but 13 is more abit
[2023-01-06 11:25:31] <%darkbiacksnow> xdd did you get game overs in p5

[2023-01-06 11:37:16] <@%julliant> Honestly if you just took away the time ghosts i think ff7r would be pretty universally liked
[2023-01-06 11:37:16] <%darkbiacksnow> FeelsStrongMan
[2023-01-06 11:37:27] <%darkbiacksnow> she's just lonely
[2023-01-06 11:37:27] <leukoc1> @NinjaMuffinTV i read somewhere they are trying that the time ghosts are fans trying to protect their sacred game KEK
[2023-01-06 11:37:36] <!%xrossdelta> KEK
[2023-01-06 11:37:38] <%darkbiacksnow> the ghosts were stupid
[2023-01-06 11:37:38] <Breadkrumb> Why is sing chat so active even when sing gone
[2023-01-06 11:37:42] <%darkbiacksnow> whatever their purpsoe were
[2023-01-06 11:37:45] <%darkbiacksnow> they made no sense
[2023-01-06 11:37:49] <@%julliant> Basically yea the time ghosts are meta commentary
[2023-01-06 11:37:50] <%mepsyduck_> DansChamp 󠀀
[2023-01-06 11:37:55] <%DuckWeed23> @wTone_ take care i wont call FBI i promise
[2023-01-06 11:38:07] <%darkbiacksnow> they can just tell their story without doing those ghosts
[2023-01-06 11:38:11] <%$NinjaMuffinTV> @leukoc1 thats some interpretation yeah KEK but i dont think its true. They just added some more mystery to the game so ppl that know the story can also get excited and theorycraft
[2023-01-06 11:38:14] <%darkbiacksnow> I was so shocked when I first encountered them
[2023-01-06 11:38:19] <%darkbiacksnow> cause I remember never seeing those
[2023-01-06 11:38:37] <!%xrossdelta> didnt they say they did that in a way so that they could bring sephiroth out earlier
[2023-01-06 11:38:44] <@%julliant> I think the ghosts robbed the game off some nice foreshadowing
[2023-01-06 11:38:49] <LazyGenes> is sing gonna be streaming today?
[2023-01-06 11:38:55] <@%julliant> He should be yea
[2023-01-06 11:38:56] <%darkbiacksnow> they brought sephiroth earlier tho
[2023-01-06 11:38:58] <%darkbiacksnow> without the ghosts
[2023-01-06 11:39:02] <!%Yolovsky> basically they backseat the characters to get into the real timeline Thinkge
[2023-01-06 11:39:04] <%darkbiacksnow> cloud already remembered him
[2023-01-06 11:39:09] <LazyGenes> okay
[2023-01-06 11:39:11] <%darkbiacksnow> from hallucination
[2023-01-06 11:39:13] <!%xrossdelta> julliant yea but i saw an arguement saying since original story already known its not exactly spoiling in a way
[2023-01-06 11:39:24] <!Kyyuna> this chat is the only place where i see FF fans monkaS
[2023-01-06 11:39:31] <%$NinjaMuffinTV> Cloud remembered way more than just sephiroth though
[2023-01-06 11:39:33] <JuicedJuicer> Susge
[2023-01-06 11:39:44] <!%xrossdelta> yea the time ghost effect in a way
[2023-01-06 11:39:46] <%darkbiacksnow> they basically told
[2023-01-06 11:39:53] <%darkbiacksnow> the entire story of OG ff7
[2023-01-06 11:39:54] <%darkbiacksnow> in part 1
[2023-01-06 11:39:58] <%$NinjaMuffinTV> Also they told people to play CC before playing Rebirth so the big twist will already be spoiled
[2023-01-06 11:40:00] <@%julliant> I mean if you dont like a certain thing you wont go out of your way to find those people
[2023-01-06 11:40:03] <@%julliant> Shrugeg
[2023-01-06 11:40:05] <%+2bitplaya> FF7 has a story? KEK
[2023-01-06 11:40:07] <%darkbiacksnow> so part 2 will probably be new
[2023-01-06 11:40:12] <!Kyyuna> no they told only disc1
[2023-01-06 11:40:14] <!Kyyuna> PepeLaugh
[2023-01-06 11:40:24] <%darkbiacksnow> nah, they told the entire story
[2023-01-06 11:40:29] <%darkbiacksnow> in the final part and all the flashbacks
[2023-01-06 11:40:35] <!Zonularity> where is shenkshenk?
[2023-01-06 11:40:39] <%$NinjaMuffinTV> They already said in some interviews that they will keep all the og story beats in the remake. Order might change though
[2023-01-06 11:40:50] <@%julliant> I dont like the argument that people play ff7 before so they can just assume people know
[2023-01-06 11:40:55] <%darkbiacksnow> I want to see how the weapons would look like
[2023-01-06 11:40:55] <%darkbiacksnow> in HD
[2023-01-06 11:40:55] <!%xrossdelta> also if u think about it, ori ff7 is edgy teen being delusional and remake is him again but what if more delusional
[2023-01-06 11:41:02] <%darkbiacksnow> are they actual GIGACHAD giants
[2023-01-06 11:41:11] <%darkbiacksnow> also gold saucer Pag
[2023-01-06 11:41:16] <%darkbiacksnow> mini game heaven
[2023-01-06 11:41:20] <hayn_e> pls no ff9 shit Aware
[2023-01-06 11:41:23] <%$NinjaMuffinTV> I want to fight the weapons. Thats gonna be POGGIES
[2023-01-06 11:41:39] <darkesTBlue_> I kinda wish they rebuilt the original FF7, then in new game + you get all the things from the new FF7 game
[2023-01-06 11:41:53] <%darkbiacksnow> however they make FF7
[2023-01-06 11:41:53] <@%julliant> 2 billion health mega boss
[2023-01-06 11:41:54] <!%xrossdelta> julliant yea if they gonna do that should just make ff7r into another title like alternate FF7 or smthg so ppl would actually try to play it as another game
[2023-01-06 11:41:55] <%darkbiacksnow> they'll get flak
[2023-01-06 11:42:00] <%darkbiacksnow> so might as well do what they want
[2023-01-06 11:42:21] <%$NinjaMuffinTV> Ill die on the hill that ff7r is a sequel though
[2023-01-06 11:42:30] <!%xrossdelta> not sequal
[2023-01-06 11:42:37] <@%julliant> Its a presequel remake
[2023-01-06 11:42:39] <@%julliant> Kappa
[2023-01-06 11:42:40] <%darkbiacksnow> alternate timeline
[2023-01-06 11:42:43] <%$NinjaMuffinTV> aerith and sephiroth know way too much about stuff that happened in the og game
[2023-01-06 11:42:45] <%darkbiacksnow> thats how I see the entire game
[2023-01-06 11:42:49] <!%xrossdelta> is more like a story retell with ppl trying to alter story or smthg
[2023-01-06 11:43:12] <%darkbiacksnow> they are making it an alternate timeline
[2023-01-06 11:43:16] <!%xrossdelta> basically kh3remind kind of shit
[2023-01-06 11:43:19] <%darkbiacksnow> so those hardcore fangays wont complain they retconned ff7
[2023-01-06 11:43:31] <%sinister_ramen> donkWalk
[2023-01-06 11:43:41] <%+Alleleirauh> Why market it as "remake" when its an entirely different game..
[2023-01-06 11:43:42] <%$NinjaMuffinTV> @darkbiacksnow yeah its an alternate timeline but im pretty sure that sephiroth is from the og timeline

[2023-01-06 11:45:14] <hayn_e> so far still feel same
[2023-01-06 11:45:16] <@%julliant> I hate what they did to wedge
[2023-01-06 11:45:35] <!%xrossdelta> but tbh since they already did it this way
[2023-01-06 11:45:36] <%darkbiacksnow> what happened to wedge
[2023-01-06 11:45:37] <leukoc1> that he's a needy boy?

[2023-01-06 11:46:02] <%darkbiacksnow> nobody dies

In chemistry, it is used to form the names of polymers by being attached to the name of the base unit of which the polymer is made, as in polysaccharide. In Dota 2, Poly is someone who plays for more than one side in the game. BOGGED

[2023-01-06 13:47:28] <%trolsopol> as a person livving in the UK this is very correct. people voted because a lot of them are biggots, and didn't think of the negatives of leaving EU, now we're all suffering and all the people that voted stay want to come back, most of the people that voted leave still want back

[2023-01-06 20:29:46] <%Christmas_Fighters> i think they won't fuck the game up
[2023-01-06 20:30:10] <%trolsopol> make it so 6 creeps per wave but give less gold for instance
[2023-01-06 20:30:14] <%Christmas_Fighters> if they did that i think pros would get angry tbh
[2023-01-06 20:30:31] <@%KJhgfr> base cooldown going down to 100 is already pretty good, either change the talent or increase global cd overall
