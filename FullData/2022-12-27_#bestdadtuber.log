[2022-12-27 08:22:15] <revenantak47> @tsundere_04 well finish them if you want or leave them if you want, it probably has something to do with their fan base, a LOT of vtubers have psycho fan bases especially if you're someone like Vox akuma your fan base is psycho obsessed with them and whole heartedly believe their in a paranormal relationship, they NEED to touch grass
[2022-12-27 08:23:46] <@%+hitsujiVT> @tsundere_04 keep the pose for reference if anything, but otherwise still burn it

[2022-12-27 08:24:00] <revenantak47> and the fact that you became friends with them probably made them jealous and they wanted to make up some bullshit to get you away from them, move on, if they were your friend they would tell you what's up and ask if it actually happened, not believe some random follower

[2022-12-27 09:38:24] [Points] MunchMeisterVT redeemed Good Dadvice (1¬†000) [What do you do about feelings of jealousy, envy, or not being "enough"? This kinda applies to a lot of different areas in my life, but generally it's a feeling of looking at other people, and I do want to cheer ppl on and be happy for their success, or at least find it neat they're accomplished in their own area. But sometimes there's that feeling that I wish I could be that talented, skilled, have their work ethic and passion, or had the foresight to have started doing X at the age of ~13]
[2022-12-27 09:38:29] <%MunchMeisterVT> I'm simply not the same person with the same hand of cards of life, nor should I compare or feel it's a race, but I can't help but compare and feel like I don't have much to be proud of, and I can't do any one thing that well, much less many things well. I guess it's also intimately tied to the fear of regret as well, of indecision and not wanting to be "something" or anything in order to avoid the regret of a choice that becomes a mistake.

[2022-12-27 09:44:37] <%MunchMeisterVT> it's hard to give a concise answer because I can't trust an answer due to coming from a flawed premise/mindset (for example, is my goal in life to avoid pain/suffering? what if that is not really a good way to live after all?)
[2022-12-27 09:45:26] <cherrimode> starting therpary this year really makes you think

[2022-12-27 09:46:45] <NixyNixFaux> sorry, phone died, so if you ask me anything I didn't hear it.
[2022-12-27 09:46:48] <%MunchMeisterVT> I think I do somewhat have an idea of a goal that will make me happy/fulfilled, or rather goal(s)... but they are too spread out and naturally conflict, you can't have everything or be everything, so it kinda boils down to deciding and making sacrifices, closing some doors so others can open
[2022-12-27 09:47:17] <cherrimode> also with social media it's so easy to think you have to "live a certain way" like you need to be grinding and causing highs all the time. ITS OKAY TO VIBE AND ENJOY THE RIDE
[2022-12-27 09:47:25] <NixyNixFaux> Oh! how was your Christmas? got anything good?

[2022-12-27 09:50:41] <%MunchMeisterVT> but yeah I do think I would be a lot happier and fulfilled if I would just choose something, and let those feelings of jealousy or inadequacy wash away
[2022-12-27 09:50:52] <banished_aurora> for one to have self confidence one must first release themselves from the worries of other for the real path is what you think of yourself and your own happiness at first before putting someone above you
[2022-12-27 09:52:20] <%MunchMeisterVT> oh yeah that's kinda why I'm so indecisive rn, I can't really come to a "right" choice, since we can't see the future or perfectly know ourselves

[2022-12-27 09:54:03] <banished_aurora> also while trying to find yourself don't be afraid to reach out if you feel lost or confused

[2022-12-27 09:54:32] <NixyNixFaux> my Christmas was awesome! but the there was one little issue we had. so my mom bought me a capture card but wanna know the catch? she got it for the wrong type of computer. my laptop can only go up to a certain resolution and the requirements for my that capture card was like 3000 by something and she got that for 87$ but thank GOD I found that out quickly instead of it being too late so she can return it. so instead she's getting me a elgato capture card so so I can stream my games.
[2022-12-27 09:54:46] <NixyNixFaux> so even if I have a potato crappy computer it will work amazingly
[2022-12-27 09:55:06] <cherrimode> also remember it takes time so don't rush yourself into having everything figured out. No one has it all figured out. We're all figuring ourselves out and doing our best
[2022-12-27 09:55:12] <%MunchMeisterVT> true yeah, I'll need to better understand myself and it can help to start picking at it bit by bit until I can trust that I know myself
[2022-12-27 09:55:16] <revenantak47> no one is worth not being able to do the things that make you happy, choose your happiness over someone who hates what you enjoy

[2022-12-27 10:36:42] <@%sesamefig> I‚Äôve been delaying repotting these plants for weeks‚Ä¶ because I wanted them to acclimate them to my home first before repotting. Or they will go into transplant shock and die on me.

[2022-12-27 13:55:00] <OriginalHamsta> @lloydgarmy Oh it wasn't written to be good.  It was written to show the publication studio's standards were worse than advertised.
