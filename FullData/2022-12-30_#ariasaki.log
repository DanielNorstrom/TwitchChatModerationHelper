[2022-12-30 00:58:54] <%bobleeswagger27> For this map, once you get get past the 1 at choke point it favors attack
[2022-12-30 00:59:09] <+drgen247> first point is more defense sided where as the fist portion of the escort is more attack sided

[2022-12-30 03:20:23] <%Sparemaple> the way to carry as a healer is to enable your teammates to carry, not try to do it yourself
[2022-12-30 03:20:25] <jkens2000> In bronze and silver it doesnt lol @owllcapone
[2022-12-30 03:20:26] <%Vini_Sensei> nobody died until now ^^
[2022-12-30 03:20:31] <MitsukiSens> @owllcapone nah, a good dps moira can change the whole game
[2022-12-30 03:20:33] <OwllCapone> I was gold 1 and plat 5 last season, extremelly hard to climb if you get placed low

[2022-12-30 03:22:39] <qiqimarri> It really does suck, if it’s a dps or a tank diff you can only do so much
[2022-12-30 03:22:44] <jkens2000> @owllcapone thats why you cant rely on being a healbot at low elo you just gotta hit headshots as kiriko or flank kill supports as dos moira

[2022-12-30 03:30:08] <ilu2_> a dps moira that can throw some heals should slay in lower elo i'd think. tbh, if you get first pick in a team fight you have like a crazy high chance to win that fight

[2022-12-30 03:44:59] <Kuligon> would make no sense if someone is for example plat in one role in terms of win/lose/mmr and then queue another role where they're for example silver, they'd get stomped in the latter role

[2022-12-30 09:58:55] <%mrq02> His staff has infinite distance, although not that much damage; it can be healed through. So what you do is use shield, get close, and then melee mode.

[2022-12-30 10:27:42] <+noy203> ya they get slowed and its easier to kill them
[2022-12-30 10:27:47] <%mrq02> One thing to keep in mind is that he has less health in wizard mode. So if you go into punch mode and get low health, you can end up dying when you switch back.
[2022-12-30 10:27:50] <%Sparemaple> e is the slow thing
[2022-12-30 10:27:51] <%+Daxed> E is how you trap people to make them easier to shoot or punch

[2022-12-30 10:29:22] <%mrq02> the basic idea is that the E slows people down a lot, which makes it easy for you to get in punch range

[2022-12-30 10:30:17] <%mrq02> So you do the same amount of damage at Widowmaker range

[2022-12-30 12:08:48] <%mrq02> @stlbrn she does a lot of damage, she just is too slow. If they have good hitscan, she's dead. But Reaper is in almost every game, so it depends on the other DPS.

[2022-12-30 12:11:57] <%mrq02> @mrkmattos I hear that a lot in the games I play. But Hog is only one character. If your team can come together and kill everyone else, then hog doesn't matter. Killing the healers is typically stronger than anti-healing the tank. fasShrug

[2022-12-30 12:26:22] <Deathpool756> unfair to the ana. They got dived by the ball it looks like. Other supports fault for not keeping her up

[2022-12-30 12:26:32] <stlbrn> Matchmaking is about as bad as Apex honestly.

[2022-12-30 12:26:35] <idkanymore__bruh> 405 healing KEKW
[2022-12-30 12:26:53] <%mrq02> Can't convince Blizzard either. They're like "most people have 50/50 win loss ratio; that means matchmaking works". NotLikeThis
[2022-12-30 12:26:55] <4evathankfulblaze> Noone is balancing that new tank I stg haha
[2022-12-30 12:27:00] <+0VincentRayne0> prolly the reason why i can climb so easily as support role for a good minute. most healers don't really actually heal.
[2022-12-30 12:27:15] <damnthgss> …
[2022-12-30 12:27:16] <stlbrn> Damn, even switched to Baptiste so he could deal 0.5 damage with his stupid burst gun

[2022-12-30 12:28:39] <%mrq02> @0VincentRayne0 they're all pretty tough. OW isn't designed for solo queue.
[2022-12-30 12:28:49] <%atomchoco> does anyone know if i play with a different region player will i get so much ping
[2022-12-30 12:28:54] <midnight_muffins> I mean, play what you want to play and all that. But roadhig is the tank of you can't trust your healers
[2022-12-30 12:28:55] <%Xluffyx1x> What are theses healers doing

[2022-12-30 12:29:11] <+0VincentRayne0> @0VincentRayne0 i mean, support is pretty easy for me to climb with
[2022-12-30 12:29:54] <+locnesss> @atomchoco at least for me ping doesnt seem to be much of an issue when i play in aus servers from cali
[2022-12-30 12:30:06] <+0VincentRayne0> @0VincentRayne0 then what is the hardest? you can solo carry as dps. and support is easy to climb with if you actually heal.
[2022-12-30 12:30:13] <%mrq02> @0VincentRayne0 then you're lucky. I'm a support main. And yet I'll have games where I'm the highest heals in the game, and do more DPS than the worst DPS player in the game, and still lose. fasShrug

[2022-12-30 12:31:26] <AshesBike> is 6k healing avg/10 good for mercy in unranked
[2022-12-30 12:32:14] <%mrq02> @0VincentRayne0 Out of Blizzard's own mouth, they design matchmaking so that you lose as many games as you win. Because they consider that a good/fair system. fasShrug

[2022-12-30 12:32:26] <cadencn> @AshesBike no
[2022-12-30 12:32:45] <aether_bird> 6k healing is low, you should have at least 10k healing
[2022-12-30 12:32:49] <%mrq02> @AshesBike I shoot for 1k healing per minute as an average.
[2022-12-30 12:32:49] <too_itzyy> mercy ult wasted...
[2022-12-30 12:32:51] <+OlgaFanClubMember> @AshesBike for a whole match? not really
[2022-12-30 12:32:54] <+0VincentRayne0> @mrq02 i must have gotten lucky a whole bunch of times in every game i play that has the role in pvp. but 50% winrate is basically a planned outcome for every team based pvp game.
[2022-12-30 12:32:57] <+OlgaFanClubMember> for 1 round yah 6k is good
[2022-12-30 12:33:19] <+0VincentRayne0> but then again, i just play for myself. and it helps a ton with that mindset.

[2022-12-30 12:34:24] VIEWERS: 4 233
[2022-12-30 12:34:26] <%mrq02> @0VincentRayne0 the primary problem with their matchmaking is that they shoot for 50/50 team wins. They don't care how you do; the only thing that matters is whether or not your team wins. So you could carry your team for 9/10 games and lose rank. fasShrug
[2022-12-30 12:34:29] <lostcrowfield> u get wins its all 1-2
[2022-12-30 12:34:29] <%+Daxed> that baptiste was allergic to healing you
[2022-12-30 12:34:32] <LadyMeowss> You need a good healer at least maybe try to duo? with whoever u find thats good

[2022-12-30 12:34:32] <stlbrn> You'll most likely have 90% winrate tomorrow or something
