I hid out in various gas stations until I finally saw Him in the flesh. I jumped out from my hiding spot and thanked Wattson for his streams and all the enjoyment he gave me. I told him I managed to achieve a Gold rank in Apex, and that's when everything went sour. He looked at me with disgust, and spat at me. This whole time I thought he was a nice person, I was wrong.

[2022-12-31 16:10:33] <%$thank_ufor_subscribing> As people age, the body secretes less melatonin, which is normally produced in response to darkness that helps promote sleep by coordinating circadian rhythms
[2022-12-31 16:10:34] <+wbauthor> sleeping less than 7 or more than 8 decreases life span...
[2022-12-31 16:10:39] <ekstaaz_fr> 4 to 5 hours for me

[2022-12-31 16:46:44] <%+QueenAlyx_> @fyshau no he doesn't, he only plays 3 minutes per hour which is the minimum to stop pre rolls
[2022-12-31 16:46:46] <JJPower4> due owns twitch and knows all the things
[2022-12-31 16:46:48] <+Nerugaru> @kh0di subscribers don't get ads KEKW

[2022-12-31 16:47:23] <+CheckeredKarma> At least Wattson runs his add when he is just sitting in the lobby! Rarely do you miss content because of ads. Cannot say the same for a lot of other big streamers….

[2022-12-31 18:01:33] <whataburgerfancyketchup> jasmine rice is run of the mill white rice. it's used in most Asian foods. basmati is seasoned and is used in Mediterranean and Indian cuisine. both are good.
[2022-12-31 18:01:34] <+sakeils> Wild rice is what I was told was the healthiest, but I don’t know if that’s true
[2022-12-31 18:01:35] <+mrbllue> Brown is just higher in fiber

[2022-12-31 18:01:43] <xTheGoodman> @HisWattson brown rice is the best, white rice is literally brown rice stripped of the "husk"/nutrients
[2022-12-31 18:01:44] <%SpiderMonk31> Spanish/Mexican rice the best.
[2022-12-31 18:01:48] <+powmow> brown vs white is just how fast it spikes your insulin, brown rice has more fiber so its slower
[2022-12-31 18:01:49] <@%BESTGlRL> @chatdontbeweird jasmine rice is just so much better lol

[2022-12-31 20:26:16] <%flexougg> @sorashiro10 @sorashiro10 the fundamentals are : playing cover, shooting your guns, and rotating. Master this and you will barely need movement
[2022-12-31 20:26:21] <@%thecrookthatcancook> sorashiro10 wattson's movement may not be flashy but it is clean. this game is about damage you put out vs damage you take and being in the right place at the right time is very important and knowing the movement to get there is very important
