[2022-12-23 01:07:12] <%TheBenShee> also yes you can only level with dungeons, you don't need to touch the story until the raid. especially the wrathion sebillian thing already has an npc you can tell that you did the unlock already.

[2022-12-23 01:39:59] <%jessedaniels> I was the same way with FFXIV but my friends are very anti-mmo
[2022-12-23 01:40:02] <%+Elltrek> Its honestly hard going back to world after getting used to the wirebug in rise
[2022-12-23 01:40:06] <eggofnog> Starsmitten do you have a high end University Degree?
[2022-12-23 01:40:08] <%nighthawk444> same

[2022-12-23 01:40:10] <%silent_tarsius> sunbreak is fun and all after you get to the anomaly investigation Sadge
[2022-12-23 01:40:10] <+ProzexCC> What about ffxiv?
[2022-12-23 01:40:11] <C1ayman_1> That's me and every rogue like LUL friends dont understand why you i like playing the same levels over and over again
[2022-12-23 01:40:11] <%+PrisonerTetsu> MHW and Iceborne was just amazing
[2022-12-23 01:40:11] <%+T3mplarr> same

[2022-12-23 01:40:22] <%flying_chloe> celiJam
[2022-12-23 01:40:22] <%+turtlet08> are you comparing Base MHW to Rise? Or Iceborn to Rise?
[2022-12-23 01:40:24] <+mahunder> oh world was my first too and the graphics spoiled me so hard for the switch
[2022-12-23 01:40:26] <%+LonelyyAbsol> celiJam this song slaps
[2022-12-23 01:40:29] <+ahnsoloxd> I did the same thing @starsmitten iceborne was my first game and then rise wasnt teh same

[2022-12-23 01:40:29] <%huangbr> Agreed. MHW is just a different vibe than sunbreak. It just feels way more polished and better.
[2022-12-23 01:40:30] <%KRaver604> Jelly_Knightx Smile celiBork
[2022-12-23 01:40:34] <%brickbandson> tell them its like a single player with MMO in it @jessedaniels PauseChamp but you probably already tried that tho...
[2022-12-23 01:40:35] <%AznDragon47> Sunbreak isn't bad. It's just from a better version of the olden games. I do support and understand you waiting for World 2 doe!
[2022-12-23 01:40:40] <%+PrisonerTetsu> turtlet08 she played to the end of IB so i think she means iceborne
[2022-12-23 01:40:42] <+JeanGHR> is that Uri?
[2022-12-23 01:40:46] <+Stoopz00> damn, i wish I had friends
[2022-12-23 01:40:48] <+ahnsoloxd> to be fair rise wasnt meant for pc it was meant for their original handheld audience
[2022-12-23 01:40:49] <%+blazentrey87> i like all the mobility of rise, the fight mechanics feel better to me. but world is a much more fleshed out world and game overall
[2022-12-23 01:40:51] <brian1651> I love Ikuta and Yoasobi songs Pog

[2022-12-23 02:39:56] <%TheBenShee> @dnasis_ my guy, i leveled 5 characters since DF 2 of which were from 10. yes. till 60 it's all legion dungeon's now since they threw SL into chromie. i literally did it
[2022-12-23 02:39:59] <%totallynotahealermain> level 55 you just do Shadowlands stuff and queue for dungeons
[2022-12-23 02:40:00] <%+theboddestmon> the new class starts at 58, the starting area brings it to 60 i believe
[2022-12-23 02:40:00] <+Daniel_Duan> Chromie puts you in old expansion
[2022-12-23 02:40:00] <%+Fugeki> @starsmitten I can run you up to 60 on an alt if you want
[2022-12-23 02:40:02] <%MeIsGregory> think just through it tutorial you'll hit 60
[2022-12-23 02:40:05] <%totallynotahealermain> guys level 55 is shadowlands
[2022-12-23 02:40:06] <%Entenstein_> evoker has their own starting area and then goes right into dragonflight
[2022-12-23 02:40:08] <%+Skab_> @starsmitten so chromie time is for questing through old expansions, if you want to level fast just do random dungeon queue and it will pick the dungeons for your level
[2022-12-23 02:40:09] <%mohr> evoker starts at 58
[2022-12-23 02:40:10] <+jWavA> so there's an npc in stormwind you can talk to and then you can do the campaign of any old wow expansion to level to 60

[2022-12-23 03:03:19] <albinopanda96> I cannot speak for others. But personally the ow2 content I enjoy the most as it’s the game I’m most interested in at the moment and I enjoy watching your gameplay. But when you do stream games like wow which I have no idea about I still chill out as I personally enjoy the streamer not the stream. But look as long as your not forcing yourself to play games which makes you miserable who cares what you play. You’ll develop the viewers based on what you wanna play.

[2022-12-23 08:11:46] <%Fitti> but then again, 7tv has many insanely creative emotes, despite the 8 billion slots ICANT
[2022-12-23 08:12:02] <%Fitti> @SpikeLuk Why not? celiHmm
[2022-12-23 08:12:12] <%Fitti> Isn't more demand helpful to grow the industry?
