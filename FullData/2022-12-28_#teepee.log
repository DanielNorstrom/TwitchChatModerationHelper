[2022-12-28 15:32:16] <%Trevyyy12> They should either increase recoil by like 50% or raise health to 150hp. That would create a larger skill gap.

[2022-12-28 15:38:04] <%xkilo_exe> I know he explains this every time, but his first loadout has a pistol. My stock loadout with hi alert has a shotgun. Can you edit the stock loadout and still get hi alert or is mine glitched? Been trying for awhile now and can never get hi alert to pop for me

[2022-12-28 23:21:45] <%JackTheNoble> The slowed the core game mechanics down drastically but made the TTK ridiculously quick. Makes for a slow game with a small skill gap

[2022-12-28 23:21:53] <@%kush06> I think with this being a 2 year cycle, Raven has more of a leash to try to integrate things in the game / fix stuff to try to keep the player base alive

[2022-12-28 23:27:14] <@%kush06> I'm all about giving it a chance its just that NONE of the improvements made with WZ1 was integrated to WZ2 so how can it be called 2.0? @cazbon

[2022-12-28 23:28:11] <+tbss_mac> just turn the volume all the way down and use it to know when people are near

[2022-12-28 23:28:13] <%cazbon> @kush06 different game engine right? and its the second warzone, i think you're looking at 2.0 too literally
[2022-12-28 23:28:28] <%maple42O> @teepee on proxy chat. My Gf and I have it off because when we play together guys say AWFUL shit to her. So brutal and disrespectful so we just had to turn it off. I feel bad for women in the game

[2022-12-28 23:28:37] <%JayHerds> Bobbys no bullet nuke and shotgun nuke have been getting some attention. Making up challeneges in the game seems to be a way to make the game better

[2022-12-28 23:29:48] <%youreexcused> @hyperbeam__ I’m in complete agreement with that lol. I miss it sometimes, but I prefer this. The problem was that all clips displayed goated movement, which isn’t nearly as big of a factor in this game

[2022-12-28 23:30:45] <bvmbl3> perhaps they seen the player count on BR dropping, so invested in DMZ?

[2022-12-28 23:31:19] <%cazbon> @kush06 from what ive read there is going to be tons of add ons to this game, for multiple years, why would they give it all to us at once? thats bad for their bottom line
[2022-12-28 23:31:43] <%youreexcused> @hyperbeam__ exactly lol
[2022-12-28 23:31:48] <bvmbl3> @Svrgical_Precision no, it's more of a tarkov game mode
[2022-12-28 23:31:50] <@%kush06> fine tuned???? that shit was still broken 6 months before it ended. I'm saying all the improvements done could have been implemented here so it didnt feel like WZ0.5
[2022-12-28 23:31:53] <%+A_Darby> DMZ upping their player base to 80 would be nice tho

[2022-12-28 23:32:28] <%deputydog803> The amount of people leaving mid match after being full dead is killing the game too. I personally get left as a solo because of the people leaving and i don't even want to finish the match myself. They need a leave penalty
