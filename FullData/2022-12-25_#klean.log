[2022-12-25 00:52:10] <nademan86> 2 sec cooldown on jumping. will would be the first to approve yeah
[2022-12-25 00:52:15] <datboynutss> @cheddie310 i think vaulting got scrapped
[2022-12-25 00:52:17] <snisky69> actually everyone in tarkov was one of those one leg long jump people in the olympics, there just tapping into it
[2022-12-25 00:52:19] <Beliar_EA> would you agree in putting a delay to shoot after landing in a jump?
[2022-12-25 00:52:20] <Slamtroop> gotcha his parkour is immaculate tho
[2022-12-25 00:52:24] <+OptionalGames> @cheddie310 that would definitely slow down  the game. no more jumping over fences after tossing  your bag and flanking heh

[2022-12-25 00:56:54] <%+ooloafobutter> solo will always be viable if you're smart about your pathing and engagements. only problem with that is you have to understand the game first which is already hard to do for new players. the future will definitely make it a lot harder for newer players coming in to play solo.
[2022-12-25 00:57:08] <+devcloudxd> the guns are cutting about wearing santa hats
[2022-12-25 00:57:11] <+devcloudxd> goons*
[2022-12-25 00:57:15] <%koiks_> so in turn big buff to all ammo types?
[2022-12-25 00:57:15] <II_Kray> If Tarkov had long TTK like apex legends it would be an amazing game..
[2022-12-25 00:57:17] <ComotheConman> can we get the trap remixes? KEKW
[2022-12-25 00:57:18] <lordulstricat> @ooloafobutter you need like 1k-2k hours to get that amount of understanding

[2022-12-25 01:20:10] <Corian614> The people who want to do bad shit are like the dinosaurs from Jurassic Park - "Life finds a way"

[2022-12-25 01:21:08] <inkantor> you can't just make a blanket statement about guns being the only or main factor for violence and crime
[2022-12-25 01:21:12] <+jadedkross> if they are to dumb to find an illegal gun they will look up how to make a bomb or if they are to dumb to do that or too smart to blow themselves up, then they will rent a truck like the guy did and run people over. THEN if they can do that there is the knife. and to dumb to find that, there is the Rock

[2022-12-25 01:21:17] <+alongwell> much like fitness, mental health, and other things, its HARD to be prepared, so most people just throw in the towel and rely on others
[2022-12-25 01:21:18] <freethrowmerchant420> wow
[2022-12-25 01:21:18] <hot_loads> a lot of gun deaths in the US are from legally held guns in the home where they're owned
[2022-12-25 01:21:19] <+tank2003> @Klean You hear that the stalker game developer was killed fighting in Ukraine
[2022-12-25 01:21:23] <junkfarmer> the world has always been messed up, its just now everyone carries around a camera to record it

[2022-12-25 01:21:37] <inkantor> @hot_loads a lot of those are suicides or self defense
[2022-12-25 01:21:38] <GoonishMoose> outright banning things doesnt work, but introducing barriers to entry such as better background checks shows promising results
[2022-12-25 01:21:38] <+itsarbitrage1337> @Theragonas Kicking in a strangers door because they thought it was their home.. So the home owner shouldnt assume a threat? Lol not how that works especially if you have family to keep safe

[2022-12-25 01:22:20] <Suspicious_Potatoes> it's not a gun problem, it's a violence/hate problem

[2022-12-25 01:26:07] <%Kuez> I get influenced by good vibes. kleanTeef kleanKool
[2022-12-25 01:26:07] <inkantor> @PsycoBlast probably half that seeing as it's going to be your own friends, family and community making up the military and they're probably not willing to fire on you and blow up your nieghborhood
[2022-12-25 01:26:08] <+alongwell> So many people also dont understand that military men and women are free thinking people and can make their own decisions. Unlawful orders are unlawful and if you think theyd be so quick as to turn on civilians youre just ignorant

[2022-12-25 01:26:36] <rollatorsved> But the guy in the hut is used to live without power / food / water, the standard american I would assume would last around 2 hours without access to a fast food place, so not quite sure the logic holds true. Also most of the people that think there is a civil war coming are the ones that raided a capitol and did not want to wear a mask, even if would had saved them from the further trouble.
[2022-12-25 01:26:38] <p4nnus> @alongwell this as well.. the whole idea of a sudden "tyranny" is ridiculous

[2022-12-25 01:37:23] <rajaion_> @klean do you think there should be any banned/restricted firearms or weapons?
[2022-12-25 01:37:24] <Beliar_EA> They actually designed Green tips so that people would live. because the army realized that if they wounded the enemy it would actually take more manpower trying to save his life then just outright killing them
[2022-12-25 01:37:33] <Theragonas> I thought 5.56 causes a lot of cavitation, which is what does most of the damage because of the terminal velocity?
[2022-12-25 01:37:35] <Overheadace> if bullets could do that i think we'd have a more underlying issue xD
[2022-12-25 01:37:37] <hot_loads> @klean my last point on guns, Australia had 18 mass shootings before they banned guns, none since, what's your response to that?
[2022-12-25 01:37:40] <%+Laughing_Man_d8D> nope was designed to wound... to burden enemy medical support with casualties

[2022-12-25 02:35:58] <+DutchM_> @DutchM_ Twitch numbers and general consensus. I haven't played in a few wipes myself but getting back in now
[2022-12-25 02:36:17] <+MustardTigrs> @DutchM_ so you have no idea what the player base numbers even remotely are got it
[2022-12-25 02:36:31] <+DutchM_> @MustardTigrs I obviously want the game to succeed as it's my favorite game, but I wonder what others are disliking keeping them away
[2022-12-25 02:36:32] <visualized> the start of a lot of the wipes have went super poorly as well, tons of server issues, queues etc.

[2022-12-25 02:37:38] <+spxxxkyyy> ^^^
[2022-12-25 02:38:01] <+DutchM_> There's no solid metric for playercount, the best data is Twitch viewer count
[2022-12-25 02:38:10] <+DutchM_> over a period of time not over a week i'm talking 3 wipes
[2022-12-25 02:38:11] <ITST1NG5WHENIP> @explosivebobby Won’t that lead to me running around against players who are stacked though? Haha
[2022-12-25 02:38:12] <%+ohdeeay> @DutchM_ I haven't played for 2-3 wipes. The only reason I don't is because there's nothing super innovative.
[2022-12-25 02:38:21] <+MustardTigrs> @DutchM_ which is quite terrible data to use for that.
[2022-12-25 02:38:24] <+DutchM_> @ohdeeay same
[2022-12-25 02:38:29] <%KrackinWise313> Yeah dark & darker is tits if they keep doing what they are
[2022-12-25 02:38:48] <+DutchM_> @DutchM_ you have to go by the best data available.
[2022-12-25 02:39:05] <FOX4N> i mean mmostats estimate there is around 180k+ players daily. easily enough to be in the top 10 of steam games that are tracked

[2022-12-25 02:39:45] <+MustardTigrs> @DutchM_ no you dont lol the playerbase is doing well and as Klean said they have broken player count records in the last three wipes so your data is shit

[2022-12-25 02:53:52] <mosqeet> The cringe minmax playstyle of a lot of streamers is the reason there are maybe 4 or 5 good tarkov streamers, watching people hold w with meta rd-704's all day isn't fun

[2022-12-25 03:09:34] <+deathbyacr1t> I think it should be on the movement bar for the stances
[2022-12-25 03:09:40] <+yeezypeezy3> you could make it an option in settings
[2022-12-25 03:09:47] <+yeezypeezy3> like showdown the hunt

[2022-12-25 03:13:35] <+deathbyacr1t> yes armor hitbox changes is a must
[2022-12-25 03:13:37] <+RebelFoxtrot> Like the armor hit boxes.
[2022-12-25 03:13:40] <InfinitumDiver> Get more in, me love 2A stuff you do, me support
[2022-12-25 03:14:02] <%+serialteabagger> i just want the full auto recoil reversed
[2022-12-25 03:14:09] <+DragonMonkeys> thats what im looking forward too as well, friends want me to play the new wipe but i want to seem some fundamental changes tbh
[2022-12-25 03:14:10] <+DJ_J0SHWA> Fax, i want them to add armor plate hitboxes so "meta ap" ammo is less meta
[2022-12-25 03:14:14] <+deathbyacr1t> sick of this AP round and level 5 armor meta
[2022-12-25 03:14:14] <InfinitumDiver> Idk why but I've been slipping in that lately
[2022-12-25 03:14:15] <%+serialteabagger> tap fire should be accurate spray should be everywhere

[2022-12-25 03:14:28] <mosqeet> armour hitbox change will have chads dying to (thorax, neck)
[2022-12-25 03:14:29] <bugsbleezy> @serialteabagger yes it needs to be toned down significantly, but not reversed I don’t think
[2022-12-25 03:14:32] <+jasp3rs> New maps is inefficient content but necessary. Ultimately, a new map is run dry in a week or so.
[2022-12-25 03:14:36] <%+StealthyHazboola> what they do this patch is more a mystery to me than any other wipe
[2022-12-25 03:14:43] <echoloch> cant wait to check it out
[2022-12-25 03:14:47] <+RebelFoxtrot> Talk to me more about streets Kreygasm
[2022-12-25 03:14:50] <pancake_kimchi> it'll be huuuugggeee
[2022-12-25 03:14:55] <%+serialteabagger> well not reversed because we still had full auto lasers

[2022-12-25 03:16:13] <+RebelFoxtrot> @Beliar_EA Theres been some speculation that up to 40 pmc's
[2022-12-25 03:16:22] <+jasp3rs> @Beliar_EA I don't think they have given a number. At least, I haven't seen one.

[2022-12-25 03:19:50] <jewbronlames> Ran over the loot
[2022-12-25 03:20:05] <+DoldaSlow> Did they do any events?
[2022-12-25 03:20:07] <+ballantt> theres also a ton of stuff on the ground outside
[2022-12-25 03:20:12] <novak1802> maybe testing random loot
[2022-12-25 03:20:16] <doughboyoo> santas here and goons are spawning? anybodsy have more details?

[2022-12-25 03:21:39] <novak1802> maybe they will reduce the container loot so that its only appealing for rats and the hotspot will be for gigachads

[2022-12-25 04:02:54] <+goqart> they made sbih so much more difficult this wipe that i gave up xd
[2022-12-25 04:02:57] <holyfrenzyoffline> any shooter is teen rating or more
[2022-12-25 04:03:00] <!%SgtOkiDoki> The problem isn't the models nor the technical part, the problem is the community coming from Battlefield mostly where attachments are more simple, as, from a player perspective, they expect the same from BattleBit too. We don't want to overwhelm the player with way too many options as I have seen it hurt.

[2022-12-25 04:03:41] <holyfrenzyoffline> yeah that would be dope
[2022-12-25 04:04:00] <siddo__> just having it be visual would be sick. wouldnt crowd the amount of attachments
[2022-12-25 04:04:16] <+squ0nk> WW# does that
[2022-12-25 04:04:16] <kaneDamascus> oooh nice call. have like 3 different handguards but 20 different models for them
[2022-12-25 04:04:17] <CheezeMarine> tarkov is so far behind what they promised just sayin.
[2022-12-25 04:04:18] <holyfrenzyoffline> for me attachment should only be cosmetic but thats just me
[2022-12-25 04:04:19] <+squ0nk> 3
[2022-12-25 04:04:22] <+RebelFoxtrot> That would be cool too.
[2022-12-25 04:04:26] <pancake_kimchi> i'm giggling over "giblets" lol
[2022-12-25 04:04:30] <pandarigger> I would love a system of simple attachment power with cosmetic skins to apply to those stats.

[2022-12-25 04:04:43] <+mrpewpwned> can we find keys in jackets rn?
[2022-12-25 04:04:45] <siddo__> IMO if battlebit had the amount of attachments that tarkov had the menu would be way way overwhelming

[2022-12-25 04:04:56] <!%SgtOkiDoki> Only skins, yap that's def doable. Max (Liquid) he is already working on getting more, it just he is one person, getting more content to each weapon is taking a while.
[2022-12-25 04:05:04] <iguinhobrgames> i love vectors

[2022-12-25 04:06:41] <siddo__> @kaneDamascus yeah and in tarkov its atleast managable because certain handguards can only fit certain grips etc. in battlebit can always equip ever single attachment. having that list be 3x as long would be very very cluttered

[2022-12-25 04:10:10] <!%SgtOkiDoki> Yea, current bipod in-game honestly sucks, making it aimable without forcing bipod would be much better as time is really low on the clock since we are preparing for the Early Access.

[2022-12-25 04:11:57] <Kubiboi> yeah rainbow six siege had that problem. they were just better ARs
[2022-12-25 04:12:06] <siddo__> slow ads, higher recoil would balance that out pretty good id say
[2022-12-25 04:12:25] <%+ooloafobutter> the mp7 goes pretty hard
[2022-12-25 04:12:27] <holyfrenzyoffline> yeah its always been a problem in video games to have lmg work correctly and be fun in games
[2022-12-25 04:12:37] <%+jahale6> @klean merry Christmas Eve buddy. Great to see you stream
[2022-12-25 04:12:43] <%+ooloafobutter> the mp7 just needs to reload faster
[2022-12-25 04:12:59] <+Typehigh> that would feel really awkward tho... fill a dude with bullets and nothing happens
[2022-12-25 04:13:24] <siddo__> what if you flip that idea and give SMGs some dmg buffs close up and gave them some more falloff? @Klean so from longer ranges the dmg would be the same as it is currently

[2022-12-25 04:13:28] <matthatt22> You think Tarkov will wipe its ass tmrw?
[2022-12-25 04:13:33] <holyfrenzyoffline> yeah make it a tier range for fights
[2022-12-25 04:13:35] <%+TaBoaConstrictrR> i feel the whole point of LMGs in video games should be holding down sight lines. maybe higher recoil, slow ADS, bad hip fire. maybe tailor LMG's to be generally used with a bipod or mounted somewhere?
[2022-12-25 04:13:46] <+Typehigh> you could make SMG's also better with faster ADS, faster reloads, maybe even faster strafing, stuff like that
[2022-12-25 04:13:52] <+Typehigh> so they shine in cqb
[2022-12-25 04:13:52] <+RebelFoxtrot> I think Battlefield 3 did LMG's very well, bipods worked great, and the suppression system made them useful.
[2022-12-25 04:13:53] <%+oATLANTICo> doesnt cod do that
[2022-12-25 04:14:05] <+Yliwos> rpm vs damage
[2022-12-25 04:14:19] <pandarigger> missed half the explanation but so true that smg are super strong

[2022-12-25 04:14:41] <guppygaming86> wipe
[2022-12-25 04:14:46] <siddo__> what if you gave smgs a small dmg buff from close range instead @Klean
[2022-12-25 04:14:47] <%goudalock> Not so funny story...I never play kbm. Like never. Battlebit I will play Irregardless of that fact.
[2022-12-25 04:14:48] <pandarigger> but the AR game is stronger.
[2022-12-25 04:14:52] <%+seal45> I remember seeing seals 3d print mags for there mp5s in iraq
[2022-12-25 04:15:02] <%+seal45> complaining about having a hard time getting them in irl
[2022-12-25 04:15:05] <%+ooloafobutter> are there fast mags? i never looked
[2022-12-25 04:15:09] <!%SgtOkiDoki> I really have no idea how the community would feel about a change like that. So far SMGs was, faster running, faster ADs, and smaller barrels to  so you have more room to point your gun, and faster firerate.

[2022-12-25 04:15:48] <@%SamuraiSavv> @SgtOkiDoki How many people do you have doing the level design? Is it one person or a group?
[2022-12-25 04:15:54] <pandarigger> I see the vector alot on the medics
[2022-12-25 04:15:58] <+RebelFoxtrot> Battlefield 2042 does that. Different weapon types have an optimal range for max damage.
[2022-12-25 04:16:00] <+bussin_ttv> stm op love that thing
[2022-12-25 04:16:03] <siddo__> for me the smgs dont have enough of an upside close range to lose the medium range option of an AR
[2022-12-25 04:16:04] <+valvalak_> i think currently the guns dnt work for this system but once the new armor hit boxes come into play the guns will kill faster
[2022-12-25 04:16:06] <%+ooloafobutter> the faster fire rate on the sub machine guns is the only reason that gun should win close quarters imo

[2022-12-25 04:16:06] <+Typehigh> @SgtOkiDoki do you have statistics on the average engagement range? I assume you do. I suspect it's pretty long (correct me if im wrong). That could also explain why SMG's aren't used much.
[2022-12-25 04:16:09] <%JAM_AINT_JELLY> @SamuraiSavv if its 1 guy he deserves a fucking medal
[2022-12-25 04:16:10] <pandarigger> I mean I only get to see them from a sniper scope KEKW
[2022-12-25 04:16:14] <NermChermsker> Don’t mean to be a downer, but one of the devs of Stalker died fighting for Ukraine @klean RIP
[2022-12-25 04:16:15] <!%SgtOkiDoki> @SamuraiSavv One level designed, one 3d modeller, 1 coder.
[2022-12-25 04:16:17] <%+seal45> they havn't updated the api documentation for gun usage since last patch
[2022-12-25 04:16:34] <siddo__> @SamuraiSavv one guy made all those giant maps??? jesus thats nuts
[2022-12-25 04:16:36] <@%SamuraiSavv> @SgtOkiDoki God damn. I've been trying to learn level design. Props to that guy for doing it alone.
[2022-12-25 04:16:44] <grunchism> @Klean So you didnt like Stalkraft or what?
[2022-12-25 04:16:44] <guppygaming86> i miss just watching klean and doing scav runs to learn tarkov
[2022-12-25 04:16:44] <%JAM_AINT_JELLY> @SgtOkiDoki give that man a raise
[2022-12-25 04:16:44] <@%SamuraiSavv> Level design is hard.
[2022-12-25 04:16:48] <vogurt> im stoked for next weekends test ive never played it and downloaded it yesterday thinking it was this weekend
[2022-12-25 04:16:49] <!%SgtOkiDoki> Yes, we have statistics but since I moved to new backend, lost all the panels where we were examining, will have to rework those panels.
[2022-12-25 04:16:53] <%+ooloafobutter> between battle bit and dark and darker you guys are creating some seriously bright gems in the gaming community

[2022-12-25 04:49:37] <$x_jdot> also a max level character with 4 perks makes a huge difference

[2022-12-25 04:58:41] <BRVCKEN> why is it called dark and darker
[2022-12-25 04:58:41] <+ajdirosa1> is this the biggest patch in the history of tarkov?
[2022-12-25 04:58:41] <holyfrenzyoffline> oh nice
[2022-12-25 04:58:49] <@%DesmondPilak> I hope they do 100% bosses soon or something
[2022-12-25 04:58:50] <Danksire> @muffdiver69420 26th
[2022-12-25 04:58:55] <@%DesmondPilak> the game is dark
[2022-12-25 04:58:55] <bjtc_brian> Everyone on factory trying to get the gpu's
[2022-12-25 04:59:05] <+arbiter41> I think it's a play on DnD
[2022-12-25 04:59:05] <+MustardTigrs> @DesmondPilak and sometimes its darker
[2022-12-25 04:59:10] <%+StealthyHazboola> Its a dungeon chat
[2022-12-25 04:59:13] <%+dregos> whats wrong with darkness?
[2022-12-25 04:59:17] <%+MTReese_> its dark, but also darker
[2022-12-25 04:59:20] <holyfrenzyoffline> its dark and they plan to make it darker KEKW
[2022-12-25 04:59:21] <BRVCKEN> idk bro just throwin out questions lol
[2022-12-25 04:59:26] <+jerbil_b> @arbiter41 thats probably true

[2022-12-25 04:59:55] <M4gnus_Manhammer> massive nerds
[2022-12-25 05:00:03] <p1nkape> are you full returning for this wipe?
[2022-12-25 05:00:09] <grey0blivion> @ajdirosa1 yeah its pretty major, but also I think once they add the story for the game. It will be more fleshed out and people have a reason for doing all those tasks in tarkov besides just for xp
[2022-12-25 05:00:14] <BRVCKEN> is better if they put in solo queues, no?
[2022-12-25 05:00:15] <%+Huh864> Merry Christmas @Klean and chat, hope everyone is having a wonderful holiday season

[2022-12-25 05:00:35] <p1nkape> ok fair enough
[2022-12-25 05:00:35] <%oldannyboy> Never go full return
[2022-12-25 05:00:54] <Danksire> @Miltop1G no doubt better than what i know of your language SeemsGood SeemsGood
[2022-12-25 05:00:55] <%+StealthyHazboola> exactly, we need the tarkov dose first
[2022-12-25 05:00:58] <@%SamuraiSavv> The game is intended to have groups of 1 to 3. Im sure it will stay that way.
[2022-12-25 05:01:01] <zyn_g0d> its good to change it up
[2022-12-25 05:01:08] <%Miltop1G> @grey0blivion they might merge some and add some new ones, we still dont have any of the faction skills so who knows ^^
[2022-12-25 05:01:10] <%+jahale6> @klean I know I have said it before but I’m really glad that you and Hutch linked up. Think it would be fun to see you all play together at some point for the new wipe

[2022-12-25 05:01:15] <+DragonMonkeys> @BRVCKEN depends on how you play it and everyone's gear, any class can 1v3, cleric might have the hardest chance tho
[2022-12-25 05:01:16] <Weasel598> @klean what are you looking forward to most with Streets?
[2022-12-25 05:01:19] <+GoRilla2015> i cant play EFT for more than 4h a day just for my sanity  KEKW
[2022-12-25 05:01:22] <grey0blivion> i can't really main tarkov but maybe when the game is fully fleshed out and finished with some story

[2022-12-25 20:45:46] <obelobe1> some scavs have gl's now

[2022-12-25 20:58:36] <Fuego_> I hang mine over the balcony railing for a few minutes like a drying pair of socks
[2022-12-25 20:58:46] <ObiFizzle> Yeah no way liver king would have the physique with only gear.
[2022-12-25 20:58:50] <inkantor> people judge liver king for lying about almost everything
[2022-12-25 20:58:52] <ObiFizzle> Man did do a lot of work
[2022-12-25 20:58:54] <trFlorida> well besides the steroids and the not showering he has some good points
[2022-12-25 20:58:54] <TSvassilev> UV can't be red
[2022-12-25 20:58:58] <+Whaaaale> He did have a really good true diet he was following just a lot of other shit piled on
[2022-12-25 20:58:59] <foe____> i think ill cut a hole in my chair and let em hang with a red light under my chair
[2022-12-25 20:59:04] <ItsRajev> Interesting. Are you stil eating Vegan if u dont mind me asking? @Klean
[2022-12-25 20:59:08] <glajman8512> forgot to pull out my red light from pants. Rudolph the red nose...
[2022-12-25 20:59:18] <+ElusiveV1> He came out and said he was on gear. for anyone that didnt know
[2022-12-25 20:59:21] <%holyfrenzyoffline> hes most healthy except when he does muscle things
[2022-12-25 20:59:23] <ObiFizzle> Exactly. Just be honest about that shit, don't try to make a living off of it
[2022-12-25 20:59:24] <+Idahol0l> hes making jokes about it now its pretty hilarious hes been cool about it after
[2022-12-25 20:59:25] <%JAM_AINT_JELLY> its lying yeah
[2022-12-25 20:59:28] <+insolentcanteloupe> I think it’s just red light, UV would be pretty carcinogenic
[2022-12-25 20:59:37] <grievesodj> Yo this is a banger btw bro
[2022-12-25 20:59:38] <%Crit91> liver king actually got his physique from pouring milk into the cereal box before pouring the cereal into the bowl

[2022-12-25 20:59:45] <docholiday2k> people dont realize the work that goes into it. you cant take gear and just get big or like liver king. it takes way more work and genetics to get that
[2022-12-25 20:59:46] <+Chuck_It> steroids are fuckin sick lmao
[2022-12-25 20:59:46] <%holyfrenzyoffline> yeah not telling the truth makes it the problem
[2022-12-25 20:59:48] <+Idahol0l> their body do whatever they fuck they want haha

[2022-12-25 20:59:53] <jutsu_papii> trt IS technically different from roids though

[2022-12-25 20:59:58] <ShadyBoBandy> When people lie about taking steroids it honestly is so annoying.
[2022-12-25 21:00:05] <+Chuck_It> how often do you light your nuts up
[2022-12-25 21:00:06] <ObiFizzle> what is trt
[2022-12-25 21:00:07] <inkantor> trt is a base for most steroids though
[2022-12-25 21:00:08] <TSvassilev> @jutsu_papii how?

[2022-12-25 21:00:27] <%Crit91> I just refer to steroids and try as PeD's
[2022-12-25 21:00:32] <+maydaypilots> man hands have been getting ashy lately and I've never experienced it in my life
[2022-12-25 21:00:36] <+snowcrackerz> I think honesty is a part of it, but most of the population who complain and talk about arent educated on the subject.... Especially in bodybuilding where they are ALL on gear
[2022-12-25 21:00:38] <%Crit91> trt*
[2022-12-25 21:00:39] <%SlanAbhaile> Careful with TRT, once you start if you ever stop it your body may not come back to natural levels ever again
[2022-12-25 21:00:40] <docholiday2k> @jutsu_papii not really its test just not as high of a dose. any base of steroids is test c, or test e. which a dr will give you for trt
[2022-12-25 21:00:50] <%GameFreakDP_> @Klean when wipe? Kapp

[2022-12-25 21:00:58] <@%SpottedTango> @insolentcanteloupe kleanActually carcinogens are things that can enter, but not be expelled from the body. UV light just causes skin damage , to the point it can cause cells to be so damaged they go cancerous.
[2022-12-25 21:01:02] <docholiday2k> @SlanAbhaile thats what trt is for your levels dropped already and wont recover

[2022-12-25 21:02:00] <docholiday2k> @ElusiveV1 you dont take dball or tren by itself, you use test e or test c as base and add others with it

[2022-12-25 21:02:27] <dankie420> if u go 1 month without fapping u will be a changed man; to all u faptards out there
[2022-12-25 21:02:28] <+ElusiveV1> @docholiday2k correct, but when taking trt youre ensuring natural levels of production - when on gear youre not looking for natural. youre looking for supernatural

[2022-12-25 21:11:45] <5cavlive5matt3r> @holyfrenzyoffline I doubt they're going to wait until next month. They've pretty much signaled they're releasing before the new year and it doesn't make sense to have drops before wipe.

[2022-12-25 21:12:11] <%holyfrenzyoffline> @aikidragon that will prob only happen when the have most of the maps out
[2022-12-25 21:12:38] <%aikidragon> of course, surely streets will be their priority even after the first iteration

[2022-12-25 21:13:33] <siddo__> @aikidragon the end game for tarkov is likely to be that all maps are connected, and you coudl enter on certain maps. but for example in order to get to interchange you would have to go through customs etc.

[2022-12-25 21:14:20] <@%SamuraiSavv> That was their original intention
[2022-12-25 21:14:52] <%aikidragon> Who knows, they might turn the open-world game mode into a DLC
[2022-12-25 21:14:54] <siddo__> @aikidragon it really isnt, they dont even have the individual pieces of the map completed, not to mention theyd probably have to do a lot of backend work for that

[2022-12-25 21:15:31] <5cavlive5matt3r> @aikidragon @ObiFizzle Video game development is much harder than gamers give credit for. This is a very ambitious project. I do think devs tend to buy into their own hype and bullshit and genuinely overestimate how hard and difficult it takes to get projects done. It's hubris but not intentional misleading

[2022-12-25 21:19:49] <5cavlive5matt3r> @aikidragon The reason you know players appreciate it is because no matter how much shit they give the game they complain that other shooters are worse than it. There's no other game like it.
[2022-12-25 21:19:53] <prozak995> @aikidragon its just been awhile so people dont realize how much progress was actually made.
[2022-12-25 21:20:03] <%aikidragon> BSG devs, from what I've seen, get a lot of hate and it's a shame. They've literally invented a new genre
[2022-12-25 21:20:25] <sganonymouz> why would they get hate?

[2022-12-25 21:20:34] <%+mrh1sock> @aikidragon yeah they get hate because the new norm is new content every month or so
[2022-12-25 21:20:48] <mediocre23rd> is it all the time different spot or this spot is the spot on customs ?
[2022-12-25 21:20:57] <+Thaulus> I don't get it what BSG is doing. It does not make much sense. They said prewipes will be short and they will start them when they have build ready to go. I dont expect wipe day being smooth with drops on top
[2022-12-25 21:20:57] <5cavlive5matt3r> @aikidragon I mean sometimes the criticism is legitimate and many of their decisions questionable but still there's a way to be respectful about it.

[2022-12-25 21:24:43] <+nevcogold> Yeah with cheating - its near impossible to stop so long as there is a market for it. Pretty much goes for any game sadly

[2022-12-25 21:40:37] <%KWPaul_Games> @klean To be fair im a pretty hard lurker, but sub when i could to support not due to ad's

[2022-12-25 21:41:00] <+TangoJoker_> @TeflonVipers yeah i feel that
[2022-12-25 21:41:02] <%+Viiseriion_> I mainly sub to support the streamer, even if I don't engage much
[2022-12-25 21:41:02] <mastermindxlk> atleast I can enjoy my time before i die. I could have cancer and stills till ads so....
[2022-12-25 21:41:05] <%JAM_AINT_JELLY> it is kind of wlid that you have to watch like 8 ad's as a preroll before you even get into the stream
[2022-12-25 21:41:05] <AvionRage> to be honest watch adds by far
[2022-12-25 21:41:05] <+FatherOwens> wish guns and armor were harder to get
[2022-12-25 21:41:06] <oddwaan> Hey, Klean. I saw that you used to compete in Muay Thai. Did you watch Adesanya x Pereira at UFC?
[2022-12-25 21:41:09] <%TeflonVipers> I'd rather say a 30 second ad every 10 minutes or so @Klean
[2022-12-25 21:41:10] <Top_Sum> my entire life is having products shoved down my fucking throat
[2022-12-25 21:41:16] <%Crit91> rather deal witht he hardship of ads I guess
[2022-12-25 21:41:19] <d3monsdead> treatable form of cancer ?
[2022-12-25 21:41:19] <chilly_s4m> if that was the two choices i would just leave
[2022-12-25 21:41:23] <TrillmongerJ> sganonymouz Witcher x fortnite collab ad
[2022-12-25 21:41:25] <%+neeenyo> A happy medium imo would be to leave the ads there with audio but just put the ad in the small screen instead of the stream going to small screen
[2022-12-25 21:41:29] <MrGruggs> fo4
[2022-12-25 21:41:35] <sganonymouz> @TrillmongerJ quiet LOL
[2022-12-25 21:41:43] <%xLIQUIDMONKEYx> I'd happily watch the ads knowing it would support my streamer for sure.
[2022-12-25 21:41:44] <CoffeeLoverEric> cancer at least doesn't have as much hope. ads can be anywhere from 3-9. and then some are 30 some are 15. every rare time I see a 2min one. so cancer.
[2022-12-25 21:41:46] <CrypticTitan29> Ads aren’t bad it’s 30ish seconds
[2022-12-25 21:41:53] <%JAM_AINT_JELLY> i wouldnt mind the ads if they werent super cringe "gamer" ad's that make no fucking sense
[2022-12-25 21:41:53] <ZyrraX> I will watch any ads for Klean

[2022-12-25 21:41:57] <sganonymouz> @xLIQUIDMONKEYx if it supports the streamer yeah
[2022-12-25 21:41:59] <Gelrandil> i would have no issues with ads if they werent locking hte live stream
[2022-12-25 21:42:00] <DirtyLesionTV> @CrypticTitan29 6 tmes
[2022-12-25 21:42:01] <captain_c0c0nut> i just started watching chainsaw man and i remember you recommending it awhile back. dope show
[2022-12-25 21:42:02] <+Twilightwalker> A streamer I know puts ads on a schedule and has a timer on screen so people know it's coming
[2022-12-25 21:42:04] <Babyeekz> @neeenyo I know at the worst times the ad pops up, i just want to hear whats happening
[2022-12-25 21:42:12] <%+ironmannrowe> You technically get ad revenue perviewers right ? whether they're subscribed or not correct?  Either way ads are the least people can do to help support the person they lurk and watch all day
[2022-12-25 21:42:18] <+FatherOwens> if they could figure out how to place ads in your dreams, they would
[2022-12-25 21:42:24] <de_pressed02> the ads would be better if they were targeting old people with 401ks
[2022-12-25 21:42:27] <+crimsonandblack> Merry Christmas everyone!
[2022-12-25 21:42:28] <%TeflonVipers> I think if they did like a 15-30 second ad every 10-15 minutes they'd get less bitching @Klean
[2022-12-25 21:42:29] <%MayZou> kleanWee
[2022-12-25 21:42:31] <sganonymouz> has anyone ever seen an ad and actually bought the things from the ad?
[2022-12-25 21:42:35] <TauGames> Convincing people that ads made mandatory "support the streamer" is such a cool trick by Twitch.
[2022-12-25 21:42:44] <chilly_s4m> to be fair if the ads werent dogshit i wouldnt mind
[2022-12-25 21:42:45] <fingersonmyhand> m16VeryEpic
[2022-12-25 21:42:49] <+GoRilla2015> @CrypticTitan29 cant wait for the day u get hit with 9 ads each 30 sec every 10min  KEKW then we talk again :D
[2022-12-25 21:42:52] <%holyfrenzyoffline> or have it in a different place not coving up the content
[2022-12-25 21:42:52] <%Toto0596> I’ll admit at first I payed not to see ads but as time went on I enjoyed the time the community and your way of thinking it was refreshing, like I said ages ago through adopting your can do attitude and learn one’s self I went from bum to someone and I’ll never forget that
[2022-12-25 21:42:52] <CoffeeLoverEric> also. subs they take a huge part of the sub funds right? tips go straight to you? or no? what do you get via their piece?
[2022-12-25 21:43:00] <%SmalltownNGames> Twitch honestly doesn't give two shits about anything but the top 1%
[2022-12-25 21:43:03] <jkingx707> the run alot more now but its alright
[2022-12-25 21:43:17] <sganonymouz> @SmalltownNGames they are the money makers ig
[2022-12-25 21:43:17] <DirtyLesionTV> can you not disable ads?
[2022-12-25 21:43:23] <+Versatildoom> Wish they'd change up the ads a bit, I get the exact same movie trailer every ad break no matter whose stream I'm watching
[2022-12-25 21:43:33] <%holyfrenzyoffline> GL now everybody stop
[2022-12-25 21:43:34] <%JAM_AINT_JELLY> twitch slowly but surely turned into mr krabs. Where me ad revenue sponge bob
[2022-12-25 21:43:39] <SebastianAdico> @Klean / chat, fairly new ETF player here. I've been struggling a bit with the difference between 7.62x39 (AKM) and 5.45x39 (AK-105). I know chart wise 7.62 (PS) is better, but I feel i play better when running with 5.45 (PS,PP,BP). Should i stick with that or make time to learn how to use 7.62 better?
[2022-12-25 21:43:40] <+nevcogold> Wait does twitch take any cut out of direct tips?
[2022-12-25 21:43:47] <%TeflonVipers> Twitch cares about APPEARING as a loving caring social platform...that also wants to make sure you watched at least 30 minutes of CONSUME ads
[2022-12-25 21:43:49] <+chknbckt> I don't mind the ads but a lot of the time it crashes the stream for me so I have to f5 then get even more ads
[2022-12-25 21:43:50] <Gelrandil> Versatildoom i think ads are locaiton based

[2022-12-25 23:16:27] <%JAM_AINT_JELLY> Is that Fallout New London still a thing?
[2022-12-25 23:16:28] <Pariah18711> want fallout london to drop

[2022-12-25 23:16:34] <+KugelWerfer88> the dying animation in fallout 4 was hilarious

[2022-12-25 23:16:50] <HOLOSON1337> I hope the mod includes sprinting
[2022-12-25 23:16:55] <%JAM_AINT_JELLY> Yeah but like they said it was a whole game basically
[2022-12-25 23:17:03] <+RebelFoxtrot> @SamuraiSavv what exactly didnt you care for? I tried playing it and also couldnt get very far, but my gripe was just with how dated it was. So the F4 mod interests me.
[2022-12-25 23:17:06] <%JAM_AINT_JELLY> bruh cyberpunk slaps with the right mods
[2022-12-25 23:17:09] <Pariah18711> DUDE i would play the shit out of fallout london
[2022-12-25 23:17:10] <%+KARMERICAN> Sooo many good mods
[2022-12-25 23:17:10] <+WaffleDefender> that new expansion looks good

[2022-12-25 23:17:13] <+teesk1> @bigdrifter I'm waiting for the updates to framerate and what not to replay 4
[2022-12-25 23:17:16] <+RebelFoxtrot> CyberPunk is amazing.
[2022-12-25 23:17:17] <%SmalltownNGames> Its really good, you'll enjoy it Klean.
[2022-12-25 23:17:17] <%holyfrenzyoffline> wait until the new dlc coming out
[2022-12-25 23:17:17] <+vahlokdotiid> game is alright
[2022-12-25 23:17:18] <grey0blivion> yeah i played recently it's super different from launch
[2022-12-25 23:17:20] <%DespiseTheirLies> NODDERS
[2022-12-25 23:17:20] <sganonymouz> i played it and its pretty good but the worst part is the bosses easily
[2022-12-25 23:17:21] <+itsarbitrage1337> was pretty decent on launch for PC tb
[2022-12-25 23:17:21] <@%+fortburke> cyberpunk is honestly really good, just a sloppy launch
[2022-12-25 23:17:21] <%+Quanz751> Have you watched edgerunners?
[2022-12-25 23:17:23] <+itsarbitrage1337> *tbh
[2022-12-25 23:17:23] <AvionRage> great game aye
[2022-12-25 23:17:26] <glajman8512> same, I waited for them to fix it.
[2022-12-25 23:17:26] <+DragonMonkeys> i mean look man, i like CP when it released. everyone complained but i had zero bugs, ive hear it only got better
[2022-12-25 23:17:28] <+SyrBryn> the add ons are so good for Cyber. best game i have played in years
[2022-12-25 23:17:28] <Pariah18711> i picked up skyrim again and tanked a mod list at it and holy hell
[2022-12-25 23:17:28] <%+KARMERICAN> mods are easy to get to work too which is nice
[2022-12-25 23:17:32] <%SpecOpSpud> I have just finished a play through of cp2077, runs very well, and is a good play
[2022-12-25 23:17:35] <+altezza300> imo its gonna be worth waiting until the Cyberpunk DLC comes out
[2022-12-25 23:17:37] <atlas_is_tipsy> fallout but ohio
[2022-12-25 23:17:38] <inkantor> yeah but imagine even bigger more dangerous creatures

[2022-12-25 23:18:53] <+teesk1> @SamuraiSavv new vegas was better than 4, 4 lacked what vegas and 3 brought to the table, 3 had the best location and characters imo.
[2022-12-25 23:18:54] <+DragonMonkeys> @SamuraiSavv if you liked 4 more than NV, idk how the hell thats possible tbh

[2022-12-25 23:19:31] <Pariah18711> @SamuraiSavv i feel as if obsidian actually had the full 18 months they were originally supposed to get to make new vegas instead of 9 it would be completely different
[2022-12-25 23:19:39] <Retnik> I liked FO3 more than FO4 or NV

[2022-12-25 23:50:29] <@%GameFreakDP_> @Klean with bean bag rounds in it, id say its ok
[2022-12-25 23:50:30] <Ozzamar> well there is the fact if you want to kill someone and not elave shells at the seen . . ., not saying to do it
[2022-12-25 23:50:31] <maxzan_> revolver flamethrower
[2022-12-25 23:50:36] <capttainbuckyohare> leetts go
[2022-12-25 23:50:55] <siddo__> @GameFreakDP_ or some shotgun rounds for it
[2022-12-25 23:50:58] <%+kevincarson89> Reminds me of the joke about the tank. Man says to his friend, I want a tank, but i can't afford it. His friend replies, well get some credit cards. The man goes, well I can't afford to pay them back, they'll take me to jail. His friend says, don't be silly, you'll have a tank! @Klean
[2022-12-25 23:51:02] <+Moonzen_> imagine breaking into revolver oceleots house and you just here twirling

[2022-12-25 23:51:24] <siddo__> i mean you could also pick up the shell if its a clean 1 shot to the head
[2022-12-25 23:51:25] <Rapanui_> why not use MIND BULLETS?
[2022-12-25 23:51:28] <FlamingDOTexe> I think wipe is near cope
[2022-12-25 23:51:36] <+A_Minotaur_Wizard> it looks like the killer bashed the victims skull in with a crowbar then placed a banana peel at his feety
[2022-12-25 23:51:59] <+CallMeChess> or get close enough and use a blank
[2022-12-25 23:52:03] <%Trent_> With modern technology it’s very hard to stage a crime scene

[2022-12-25 23:53:20] <@%^Nightbot> All items on the traders are dirt cheap. We have all been exposed to a Toxin by therapist You WILL DIE if you do not get antidotes in raid though bosses, airdrops and sometimes scavs. You cannot bring them IN to a raid so use them in raid.
[2022-12-25 23:53:32] <%+kevincarson89> Did anyone find my joke about the tank humorous? No? I'll see myself out.
[2022-12-25 23:53:34] <siddo__> @Trent_ kind of crazy to think that back in the day you could shoot someone and just walk away and the chances of you getting caught would be tiny

[2022-12-25 23:55:09] <siddo__> @Trent_ like all the dumb shit people do in action movies and never get caught was probably pretty realistic 30 years ago

[2022-12-25 23:56:26] <%Trent_> @siddo__ yea it definitely don’t work like that anymore lol
[2022-12-25 23:56:28] <sneaky937> Hope the changes are actually chagnes because I've not played this game for 3+ years just because the gameplay loop has been the same for almost half a decade
[2022-12-25 23:56:40] <ItsRajev> How much longer you streaming for tonight if u dont mind me aksing? @Klean
[2022-12-25 23:56:40] <Thee_Smooth> its going to be like the Cycle
[2022-12-25 23:56:44] <%holyfrenzyoffline> that when i will play it non stop
[2022-12-25 23:56:48] <+richboy212> From ur vid talking about streets, would you say the way in-game traders would work would be like in anomaly how you have to transition between maps?
[2022-12-25 23:56:53] <Unbe> Exciting
[2022-12-25 23:56:56] <%+ooloafobutter> that sounds so amazing
[2022-12-25 23:56:57] <ULTIMVTUM> really can't wait for those extremely long raids
[2022-12-25 23:56:58] <+pochiyeah> I wonder if they are gonna do a megamap (no idea how) or if they gonna have loading between
[2022-12-25 23:56:59] <%TheWalkingDad263> please god i hate the timer
[2022-12-25 23:57:15] <MagosZed> They want all maps linked dont they so you could move between them as needed?
[2022-12-25 23:57:17] <SharkToothAU> @pochiyeah They want a mega map
[2022-12-25 23:57:21] <%fatzoots> is itconfrimed streets is actually coming this wipe?
[2022-12-25 23:57:36] <%holyfrenzyoffline> im just happy to get a place with a bigger map
[2022-12-25 23:57:46] <Thee_Smooth> i like the idea of an ongoing lo-cal the way the cycle does it
[2022-12-25 23:57:46] <SharkToothAU> @fatzoots Yes, but only a tiny portion of the map
[2022-12-25 23:57:49] <+SpaceSteg> @fatzoots yes

[2022-12-25 23:58:29] <HellzAngel0> they still need to make sound better
[2022-12-25 23:58:31] <jakkuba99> gosh... just imagine the full game...
[2022-12-25 23:58:34] <+pochiyeah> slideshow streets inc PepeLaugh
[2022-12-25 23:58:37] <gucci_reseller> even if it releases it will be shitshow fps
[2022-12-25 23:58:38] <MagosZed> Even with all the framerate issue I like Lighthouse design
[2022-12-25 23:58:38] <CookiThumper> customs was dumb small i feel like before the ne up date like a year or two ago
[2022-12-25 23:58:40] <+A_Minotaur_Wizard> Like David Ershaun from the movie The Other Guys.... the devs like to tell a story starting at the end and then going back to multiple view points throughout the story and then wrapping back up to the end.
[2022-12-25 23:58:44] <%+ooloafobutter> nikita said when the full map is released, its going to be the most complex map in FPS history
[2022-12-25 23:58:46] <+captainpaddy_ttv> the woods expansion blew me away
[2022-12-25 23:58:48] <+half_n_half> and as Unity gets better, this game will too
[2022-12-25 23:58:49] <Thee_Smooth> EFT also doesnt copy pasta most Assets , so its gonna be all fresh
[2022-12-25 23:58:52] <%+RomanRogal> PepeLaugh Powerpoint incoming
[2022-12-25 23:59:02] <siddo__> @CookiThumper the middle of the map was basically 2 chokepoints
[2022-12-25 23:59:09] <%holyfrenzyoffline> all custom assets

[2022-12-25 23:59:37] <+jedy357> I read the wipe should be on 26th, is it true?
[2022-12-25 23:59:42] <+A_Minotaur_Wizard> If you don't appreciate the toy T-rex in the porn studio room then you arent a real person.
[2022-12-25 23:59:52] <Gr4vediggin> even dorms are not the same.. only room sizes, but not the contents, not the good and bad angles etc @Klean
[2022-12-25 23:59:55] <kennysexman> @jedy357 no one knows
[2022-12-25 23:59:59] <+EkSpectre> I just want a double barrel and a mosin, and I'll be happy for wipe :D
