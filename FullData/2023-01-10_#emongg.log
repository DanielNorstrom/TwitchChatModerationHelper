[2023-01-10 15:45:37] <@%^StreamElements> If you're noticing ads at unfortunate times, Twitch now requires all streams to run ads at set intervals. We're not triggering them, they're on Twitch's end and out of our control.
[2023-01-10 15:45:46] <%+impicklepix> Coloring really does make a difference 😂 that yellow on the mask skin just ain’t it

[2023-01-10 15:53:32] <Xenomorph_98> @talon824 but I do feel like he should be allowed to oneshot a 250 hp char with the grab
[2023-01-10 15:53:37] <%Culein_> if its two dots, its QP, if its a number its comp @finiyatta
[2023-01-10 15:53:40] <%TheBinaryStorm> @T34Boss You'll kill hog quicker if he doesn't have breather
[2023-01-10 15:53:41] <ll00zr> and she will do games too

[2023-01-10 16:46:41] <+darklord1061> rein isnt even that bad, he's one of the most fun to play in this, he heals when he charges, and his ult allows him to spam charge which 1 hit kills

[2023-01-10 18:56:45] <%greg0409> I am a sojourn player and Ive been saying this for a while. Just nerf the railgun, revert the spread change (a tiny bit) for primary. Make it so she cant crit with railgun, and she becomes more focused on her primary fire and less on her alt fire
[2023-01-10 18:56:45] <%+powerupemmy> i rescind my copium statement
[2023-01-10 18:56:59] <%greg0409> also, nerfing damage boost would help too :)

[2023-01-10 18:57:40] <%+Frankenfunk> If they nerf genji it will fix the problem
[2023-01-10 18:57:41] <entryfireghosthero> they should just reduce the railguns range so she isnt both a better sniper AND a better 76
[2023-01-10 18:57:41] <+ActuallyNarwhal> honestly just remove railgun headshot
[2023-01-10 18:57:53] <Cieverpup> 10 is generous
[2023-01-10 18:57:59] <%greg0409> @tm_901 I mean, why not both? and then they can let it crit in ult if they want
[2023-01-10 18:58:02] <%ihateMOONMOON> I used to be in the "one shots are okay" camp but I've been convinced that in OW2 they aren't as needed and can be toned back, I think they need to do that to all 1 shots rn
[2023-01-10 18:58:10] <elitch___> @entryfireghosthero excellent idea! nerf genji

[2023-01-10 19:39:55] <slushie_____> so did they boost her healing from wounds?
[2023-01-10 19:39:56] <+blakey0899> it's interesting to see that the meta for both console and pc are identical, cool to see
[2023-01-10 19:40:29] <%+tm_901> no it just shows how bad the balance is atm
[2023-01-10 19:40:37] <+blakey0899> @slushie_____ the recent one was she gets the healing from a bleeding target that dies, but recently they did buff it
[2023-01-10 19:40:39] <%Serenade212> @slushie_____ sort of, they routed some damage from knife to wounds & made it so that if you overkill you still get the heal
[2023-01-10 19:40:55] <+blakey0899> @tm_901 also fair
[2023-01-10 19:40:57] <+star___bright> The base bleed to JQ heal rate is still abysmal
[2023-01-10 19:41:11] <slushie_____> @blakey0899 @Serenade212 ty. I think it's such a cool mechanic so I'm glad to see some support for it

[2023-01-10 19:57:52] <senator_ko> why people hate hog? he has no block or shield ability, so instead he has one shot on squisheees.

[2023-01-10 20:09:22] <+prized_1> @gamekyrgyz Winston bubble can get rid of his ult
[2023-01-10 20:09:22] <BillyTwoShoes> maybe reduce ram ult aoe?
[2023-01-10 20:09:39] <BillyTwoShoes> or time limit

[2023-01-10 20:09:45] <%+bApplejax> aoe shrinks as time goes?
[2023-01-10 20:09:49] <hannibal314> that could work.  or reduce the mitigation from blocking
