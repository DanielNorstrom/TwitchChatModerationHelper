[2022-12-29 06:55:17] <%Letaali> ilmarinen is the smith who in the myth made sampo, the machine that makes gold, salt and flour infinitely @DunkOrSlam

[2022-12-29 06:55:27] <%DietSilence> unironically exactly how a team of minecrafters located the seed from the OG new world image

[2022-12-29 06:55:49] <%myndzi> minecraft seed finding and prng analysis goes pretty deep

[2022-12-29 06:55:54] <%tw1stf> theres already a sampo next to the mines entrance, can you get any faster than that?

[2022-12-29 06:56:14] <%myndzi> iirc they optimized for more than just massive parallelization

[2022-12-29 06:56:52] <%Letaali> my previous message explained why Ilmarinen was mentioned tho, it is the name for a special role on noita discord, for finding natural extra sampo
[2022-12-29 06:56:56] <%DietSilence> yep SalC1 made the final video on the new world seed project

[2022-12-29 06:57:06] <%pudy248> Basically orbs spawn in place of sampos with a 1/1000 chance, so in finding the orb, I found a lot of sampos that aren't orbs
[2022-12-29 06:57:18] <%xurxo__> ohh gotcha so its just sampos
[2022-12-29 06:57:28] <%DietSilence> i wonder what other mathematical novelties exist in the far reaches of noita seeds
[2022-12-29 06:58:03] <%pudy248> lmfao it's 1 in 150 million for a natural orb, manual checks would be impossible
[2022-12-29 06:58:29] <%Letaali> "just stumbled on on this orb, now give me the secret role"
[2022-12-29 06:58:31] <%myndzi> not impossible, you'd just have to get really lucky ;)
[2022-12-29 06:58:39] <%pudy248> @Letaali literally what I said to slurrps

[2022-12-29 07:06:08] <%myndzi> no, they are unrelated concepts. cosmetics in dunkbot are just an enum for a layer, but could be converted to something more flexible
[2022-12-29 07:06:10] <%Letaali> hold on, should be 5
[2022-12-29 07:06:19] <%myndzi> the json is how dunkbot stores who owns what etc
[2022-12-29 07:06:31] <%nolava> @pudy248 that’s what I was asking 2 - need 3 eoe - 2 orb 1 sampo from how I understand

[2022-12-29 07:06:40] <%myndzi> i was just saying there's a number of classes of improvements that can be made, one of which is better layering

[2022-12-29 07:22:24] <%Letaali> and crashwand would save you from any peaceful endings
[2022-12-29 07:22:36] <%Letaali> and that would save you about 10h

[2022-12-29 07:25:46] <%Astralcorgi> Seems like a good way to stay up for 24 hours
[2022-12-29 07:25:46] <%nouky_73> all in Dunk
[2022-12-29 07:25:48] <%Letaali> it will drive you absolutely mad, is my guess
[2022-12-29 07:25:49] <%AnthonyAgainst> sounds exciting, but its gonna be a bitch to do, so stock up on snacks and stuff @DunkOrSlam
[2022-12-29 07:25:53] <%KookieBreed> i was looking for an all pillars run at the same time i roughly found you. so im super excited! @DunkOrSlam
[2022-12-29 07:25:54] <%$isaacleeontwitch> It's a dirty job but someone's gotta do it.
[2022-12-29 07:25:56] <%Tholinat> i can't imagine going through that grind
[2022-12-29 07:25:56] <%+koolcatwest> Perfect stream to swim to
[2022-12-29 07:26:00] <%nolava> @dunkorslam do multiple runs?
[2022-12-29 07:26:01] <%AnthonyAgainst> and as usual, im gonna be here for the entire event, so dont fuck up
[2022-12-29 07:26:01] <GILF69> I think if you do it blindfolded then it would be impressive LUL
[2022-12-29 07:26:01] <%vulporium> it's a marathon imo
[2022-12-29 07:26:03] <%beanbeam> What is the total EoE count? It’s gotta be a lot
[2022-12-29 07:26:08] <%scobunk> no hit adds an additional 72 hours to the run
[2022-12-29 07:26:09] <BroShock_> I can't wait to see 70 pillars in one minute PauseChamp
[2022-12-29 07:26:12] <%AnthonyAgainst> the 36 hour one took me way too long to recover from LUL
[2022-12-29 07:26:19] <%+ailoops> 3x lotr movies worth of sampo greater chest farming HahaDoge
[2022-12-29 07:26:21] <%JohnnyNineTW> What if it's multiple runs. Just get all the achievements form a fresh file?
[2022-12-29 07:26:23] <LeadSail> I think it sounds great, But if you die at 10+ hours (like last time) just try it again but with glitches so speed things up
[2022-12-29 07:26:31] <%+dusty_sprinkles> I think you're asking too much of yourself to do it glichless tbh
[2022-12-29 07:26:44] <GILF69> doing this event with a controller riiiight?
[2022-12-29 07:26:51] <%Letaali> @BroShock_ would be cool to see LUL
[2022-12-29 07:27:05] <%nolava> @dunkorslam did you have to do it all in one run? Could you split it up? It would still be a massive event to get all the pillars in one stream

[2022-12-29 07:52:04] <%myndzi> @DunkOrSlam there's a very clear argument here; the mod doesn't change the gameplay, and it doesn't give you anything you can't already get. it just makes it less tedious. and you've done position-greater-chests without mods already multiple times

[2022-12-29 07:52:14] <%WaxNumen> Dunk is already sideloading Letaali's chainsaw audio fix. Our streamer is a cheater Sadge
[2022-12-29 07:52:15] <%+Andestrious> mods on if you somehow die then? just to make the run less tedious
[2022-12-29 07:52:16] <%Letaali> 3 peacefuls = 2 orbs 1 sampo x3 = 9. NG+++ = 3 sampos. 3 endings and first sampo is free. Total of 14 EoE uses
[2022-12-29 07:52:31] <%+shmameron> I can't believe dunk is cheating by dnkNoted using a mod that tells you what your coordinates are

[2022-12-29 07:52:41] <%+redtens> especially if you have to do it multiple times in one run, i think the coords in-game is acceptable

[2022-12-29 08:12:31] <%+RNGrizzly> Lumping all mods together as though they're equivalent is illogical. This does exactly what that method does, it just takes infinitely less time. It would be as though in an alternate Noita your wands only show their remaining charges when the menu is open, and you installed a mod to see the charge count on the wand bar, leading to what is there now

[2022-12-29 08:32:27] <%myndzi> @Vexilus_ you've gotta be faster basically, or else you have to hope the shop doesn't sell out and try again. you MIGHT have a chance if you put a bunch of trash on the end, that's improved my chances with double buys

[2022-12-29 08:33:07] <sammas90> what happened if you put the greater chest at the alter
[2022-12-29 08:33:19] <Vexilus_> @myndzi I think I was just ignored by twitch end. usually for shops I just type !deposit 1 in chat and wait for Dunk's open shop message before hitting enter.
[2022-12-29 08:33:23] <%xurxo__> DO A VOTE
[2022-12-29 08:33:24] <%myndzi> it's not entirely "repeated content", we tested that at one point. i think it's most likely just "message rate" - but i still have a suspicion that similarity of message affects it a little
[2022-12-29 08:33:32] <%Mikemage> the one that takes longer is the better one Kappa
[2022-12-29 08:33:33] <DotFIow> @sammas90 same thing as a normal chest, unfortunately

[2022-12-29 08:36:45] <%+dusty_sprinkles> you could maybe make a 2nd yt channel just for the long streams if you're worried about the algorithmtm
[2022-12-29 08:36:46] <%Letaali> this idea we are now considering, could be watchable on youtube too
[2022-12-29 08:36:50] <%$isaacleeontwitch> I watch eight hour OOT rando runs someitmes
[2022-12-29 08:37:00] <%Trypto_phan> gotta cut the footage down by taking out the pauses between words
[2022-12-29 08:37:01] <%MadderoftheFew> same but with WW instead of OOT
[2022-12-29 08:37:02] <KlockoArt> to be honest i'd probably watch the vod on youtube, could be something to keep me entertained while i go about my day
[2022-12-29 08:37:09] <%+Wckdneer> @DunkOrSlam you really really underestimate youtube, its where I came from. I thoroughly enjoy having full runs on there to watch. Even if they are 40 hours I can watch them during breakfast or dinner etc over many days
[2022-12-29 08:37:10] <%rickym4rtin> you should set up a 2nd channel of just full vods im sure it would do better then you think
[2022-12-29 08:37:13] <%xurxo__> @DunkOrSlam you didnt think people wanted to know how to chainsaw wrap but everyone from youtube comes to twitch from that video
[2022-12-29 08:37:19] <%xurxo__> i think you should upload the event
[2022-12-29 08:37:28] <%xurxo__> or just longer runs to yt
[2022-12-29 08:37:34] <nikita20031405> holy bomb to kill the alchemist?
[2022-12-29 08:37:35] <%KookieBreed> as someone who has watched almost all your youtube content, i would 100% watch a 30 hour vod of you farming while at work @DunkOrSlam

[2022-12-29 08:38:10] <%MadderoftheFew> @DunkOrSlam people who do 8+hr streams of their games say their 8+hr vods get more views than their shortform content, especially unedited. ppl like a yt video to fall asleep, work, study, etc. to!

[2022-12-29 08:38:19] <%+Wckdneer> @Ecklerion throw an empty wand into a pool of pheromone, and it will spawn invisible ghosts, you can kill those
[2022-12-29 08:38:22] <%+shmameron> @ecklerion empty wands in pheromone spawn invisible ghosts that can be killed for gold

[2022-12-29 08:38:25] <%rickym4rtin> love the longer vods for just playing while im doing my own long runs

[2022-12-29 08:38:42] <%Letaali> could name it like "Pillar blitz" where you need to get a set of pillars in a row and a death resets the whole thing
[2022-12-29 08:38:44] <%xurxo__> thats the vid
[2022-12-29 08:38:46] <%V1k1ng2003> #viking i have an idea. no hit 36 orb NG+26 or whatever the max is

[2022-12-29 08:38:50] <ergotPheasant> @ecklerion kill those ghosts with tablet, but don't kick tablet!
[2022-12-29 08:38:54] <Ecklerion> Ooooh thank you guys, didn't know that :D
[2022-12-29 08:38:59] <Mayerling> @WUOTE TIL about great depression era "water pies"
[2022-12-29 08:39:01] <%Trypto_phan> i like long videos too, feels less like i have to pay attention to every moment, makes it easier to watch while i do other things
[2022-12-29 08:39:02] <%Letaali> and the pillar cosmetic would still work for it
[2022-12-29 08:39:15] <%scobunk> a long VOD was how I found your channel
[2022-12-29 08:39:16] <%scobunk> !quack
[2022-12-29 08:39:17] <Charlson__> maybe the new game++? I had trouble to find the random orbs.

[2022-12-29 08:39:26] <%+Wckdneer> @DunkOrSlam and its for people who can't be there during a specific time but sitll want to watch what happpened during the stream.
[2022-12-29 08:39:27] <%xurxo__> @Ecklerion i sent the youtube link
[2022-12-29 08:39:34] <%xurxo__> https://youtu.be/Q34tIe-7ycI

[2022-12-29 08:39:38] <%lols_royce> i dont know if im the representative audience, but there are a bunch of people i watch on YT who post long vods with chat overlay
[2022-12-29 08:39:39] <%wwwwebster> Your Midas run is how I found you
[2022-12-29 08:39:41] <%poecilocampa_mothwood> i would also watch super long vods uploaded to youtube
[2022-12-29 08:39:43] VIEWERS: 681
[2022-12-29 08:39:44] <%richoze> if you pick up a thunderstone you can farm with pheromone a lot easier and they are pretty common
[2022-12-29 08:39:47] <%V1k1ng2003> idk nightbot it seems like it
[2022-12-29 08:39:51] <%+shmameron> you could have been digging with holy bomb
[2022-12-29 08:39:52] <CptSpecter> I need something to watch while I endless grind war thunder
[2022-12-29 08:39:54] <%GodmodeDio> I watched the sun quest twice. once to sleep and a second time because it was hella interesting
[2022-12-29 08:40:08] <%poecilocampa_mothwood> i wanted more so i came to your twitch to watch all the twitch vods and now i watch live every day
[2022-12-29 08:40:09] <%+any_one_plz> You could split a stream up into multiple video instead of one long vid
[2022-12-29 08:40:09] <Ecklerion> @xurxo__ Yep thanks I'm watching it :)
[2022-12-29 08:40:12] <%Letaali> read me
[2022-12-29 08:40:12] <%+Wckdneer> @DunkOrSlam you yourself as a person I dont think are a very good representation of the youtube audience :D
[2022-12-29 08:40:13] <%myndzi> my brother caught up on the critical role backlog ... never underestimate media consumers
[2022-12-29 08:40:14] <%$isaacleeontwitch> @DunkOrSlam 2nd channel for giga-vods?
[2022-12-29 08:40:16] <%+any_one_plz> Farm views :3
[2022-12-29 08:40:20] <%xurxo__> @Ecklerion np :)
[2022-12-29 08:40:21] <%Cloudmillion> Hey there sweetheart
[2022-12-29 08:40:21] <%Naicii> @CptSpecter Watcha grinding for
[2022-12-29 08:40:27] <djIights> @Ecklerion if you cover a wand totally with pheromone an invisible ghost picks it up and starts using it like a taikasauva wand.  But if you empty out all the spells from the wands the ghosts start spanning but they cannot pick up an empty wand.  So the game just keeps spawning the invis. ghosts over and over.  Using a tablet to smash them creates a good bit of gold.
[2022-12-29 08:40:30] <ergotPheasant> maybe time for 2nd YouTube channel zeriliSquish
[2022-12-29 08:40:35] <nikita20031405> I watched the sun quest twice. once to sleep and a second time to sleep too
[2022-12-29 08:40:37] <CptSpecter> @CptSpecter Almost on the 29, using a talismaned SMT
[2022-12-29 08:40:44] <%xurxo__> see people love long runs
[2022-12-29 08:40:50] <Mayerling> @DunkOrSlam boredom (or lack thereof) is in the eye of the beholder. the beholders seem to not think long vids are boring
[2022-12-29 08:40:51] <+BtownDtown> just tuned in, whats the theme of tonight's run
[2022-12-29 08:40:53] <Vexilus_> @myndzi A buddy of mine watched One Piece from start to present without a month or two

[2022-12-29 08:41:27] <%+Wckdneer> dunk, dont make me make an unofficial vod channel. Although you're not a true twitch streamer without an unofficial vod channel
[2022-12-29 08:41:28] <bgijy1> @Vexilus_ Is your buddy okay?  That sounds like depression

[2022-12-29 08:41:53] <%myndzi> one piece: ~1000 20-minute episodes. critical role: ~300 ~5 hour episodes. i think CR wins LUL
[2022-12-29 08:41:53] <%Letaali> we could add a lot of the different pillars to the pillar blitz idea, it could have greed curse win as part of it too
[2022-12-29 08:42:04] <%V1k1ng2003> @DunkOrSlam i have an idea. no hit 36 orb NG+26 or whatever the max is

[2022-12-29 09:03:25] <%KookieBreed> does the daily practice run use the same seed as the actual daily? and if so, is alchemical precursor and midas have the same combination in that seed?

[2022-12-29 09:03:56] <%tw1stf> @tw1stf the setup is pretty jank, i haven't got it very consistent yet, i think you want to throw the tablet as soon as you get to the ledge but it depends on the alchemist's path

[2022-12-29 09:15:50] <%darkmatter1987> @DunkOrSlam i just got it! Doesnt this audio (new guy in the corner puking his guts out) explains vomit to meat fungal transmutation?
[2022-12-29 09:15:50] <nikita20031405> @tw1stf can you use invisibility to force him to go to the exact position?
[2022-12-29 09:16:09] <%+shmameron> 1 minute should be safe, my 5 minute timer just went off
[2022-12-29 09:16:23] <%Naicii> why didnt you just make more LC while waiting for the shift cd
[2022-12-29 09:16:24] <%auillolo02> isn't there any mod that helps with that?

[2022-12-29 09:16:31] <%tw1stf> @nikita20031405 no, the boss is weird because he only stands still if he's actively being attacked but can't find the player. His default behavior is to wander around the room idly
[2022-12-29 09:16:36] <%+shmameron> and that was pausing during your pause yes
[2022-12-29 09:16:41] <%Letaali> I think you are good already

[2022-12-29 10:33:11] <Vexilus_> @DunkOrSlam I did a run where I duplicated Faster Movement to try and achieve light speed. I had like 1000+ stacks of Faster Movement, didn't realize it would hit integer overload. I couldn't move and had to spiderman my way around with telebolt
[2022-12-29 10:33:11] <BroShock_> Fair trade. You save the heart mage from the fire, they multiply your HP by 20

[2022-12-29 10:34:34] <ishadows0> i prefer speed untill it comes to movement precision issues
[2022-12-29 10:34:34] <Vexilus_> Gravity didn't affect me either
[2022-12-29 10:34:35] <%measticles> you were probably moving so fast you spontaneously teleported between worlds
[2022-12-29 10:34:37] <%+shmameron> also @vexilus_ how many stacks was that
[2022-12-29 10:34:38] <Vexilus_> I was actually stuck in place
[2022-12-29 10:34:57] <%nikita20031405> I'm sure it was not an integer overflow
[2022-12-29 10:35:19] <%Pe4enie> @nikita20031405 why? isn't the perk just doubling it every time?
[2022-12-29 10:35:25] <%lols_royce> NOTED
[2022-12-29 10:35:34] <Vexilus_> @shmameron I don't remember the total but I think I had 1024 stacks. Afterwards I tested and it only takes like 5-10 to get light speed
[2022-12-29 10:35:35] <%+Tristan_Compton> 4

[2022-12-29 11:03:12] <%Niborius> What's todays run exactly? Is this a predetermined seed to find the sampo in a great chest?
[2022-12-29 11:03:17] <ZaximusRex> I personally like to buy ethically sourced LC

[2022-12-29 11:04:08] <%Niborius> @shmameron Ohh thanks!
[2022-12-29 11:04:08] <%MadderoftheFew> @Niborius no, it's the daily run. chest contents are based on the chest's coordinates. he has a website that tells you what coordinates you need to open a chest at to get a sampo according to your seed.
[2022-12-29 11:04:09] <%683552ccae99> Did you see the condition they live in? Not holy for fish
[2022-12-29 11:04:09] <ZaximusRex> This LC is USDA approved my man.
