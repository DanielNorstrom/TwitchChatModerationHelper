[2022-12-11 14:13:36] <RoloffMatek> one punch man is a parody of shonin and teaches people about depressions and lonelieness
[2022-12-11 14:13:42] <JabezzTV> dragon ball super not bad but a bit too over
[2022-12-11 14:13:42] <CadzFPS> i enjoyed buu saga
[2022-12-11 14:13:47] <monts18> cell saga holy

[2022-12-11 14:13:58] <dezaq> one piece might be good but it has the most cringe fanbase out there
[2022-12-11 14:13:59] <CadzFPS> dragonball super has a bad start but they fixed it mid way

[2022-12-11 14:51:49] <Snaizzz> yeah bus is not good for game health
[2022-12-11 14:51:54] <+reahax> it also kills low level raids. almost impossible find valtan hard grp with below 1460 char.
[2022-12-11 14:51:54] <yourlieinapr1l> reasons why i bus only argos with dps and sup valtan and etc...

[2022-12-11 14:52:12] <xxxdemonhandlerxxx> @Taknarosh the new power pass gives u abyss gear now, so argos bus wan't be that attractive any more
