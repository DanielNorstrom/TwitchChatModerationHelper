[2022-12-26 10:35:53] <willwhit99> @trentthedad no because Hikaru could just block the 2nd rank with that same bishop, protected by queen

[2022-12-26 10:38:20] <iliasnik21> guys the engine you see here is a cloud based stockfish 15 which  means that it is way stronger than lichess' web based one

[2022-12-26 10:39:44] <whocallinthefleet> @hiiipwr8 well all openings are copied from top chess players in history
[2022-12-26 10:39:47] <+marcus071903> @hiiipwr8 yep but its impossible to memorize prep for everything
[2022-12-26 10:39:47] <jchosen> i think white has to take b7 here
[2022-12-26 10:39:49] <+RudySr> @hiiipwr8 yes it's best moves but try predicting moves past move 4 or 5
[2022-12-26 10:39:51] <Mathyu02> there is this thing called preparation bruh

[2022-12-26 10:40:03] <bigpriestslayer> hikaru just needs to play like Sauron
[2022-12-26 10:40:04] <%matterhora> hikaru is going to win this trust me
[2022-12-26 10:40:05] <ravagedtv> @hiiipwr8 nope. Its just prep, still uses a lot of memorization skill. in game would be cheating
[2022-12-26 10:40:05] <echozzzz99> i think engine have perfect path to push the pawns
[2022-12-26 10:40:05] <ViingadoR> i don't want to be annoying but Hikaeu moves doesn't make sense to me he plays one move and then he changes his mind and play what was best originally maybe just warming up still
[2022-12-26 10:40:06] <jchosen> rook takes f8 check, then rook takes b7
[2022-12-26 10:40:08] <+aussby> @papa_deeez it was an opening prep diff

[2022-12-26 12:34:02] <justanotherchatter_> the chess speaks for itself
[2022-12-26 12:34:02] <%Dr_TLMK> when is Hans vs Magnus?
[2022-12-26 12:34:04] <astrecsfps> will magnus play hans or is he going to resign the match ?

[2022-12-26 12:34:05] <@%^Moobot> @d4nie11111 The World Rapid and Blitz is TWO events! The Rapid is a 13 Rd 15+10 Swiss Tournament over 3 days. The Blitz is a 21 Rd 3+2 Swiss Tournament over 2 days -- if players tie for 1st place there's always a playoff!

[2022-12-26 13:05:45] <beadle_a> @ネボ it's a Swiss format — you get points for wins/draws in your games, and the person with the most points at th end wins. So everyone plays every round
[2022-12-26 13:05:46] <asuna12121> hikaru is doing so so sadge
[2022-12-26 13:05:50] <@%Xrispie> Hikaru is at 1.0 /2.0

[2022-12-26 13:06:28] <ainybear> @IPK_1s he may get easier pairings now, because he has low points
[2022-12-26 13:06:30] <IPK_1s> @ainybear swiss format is literally luck in the 1st few rounds
[2022-12-26 13:06:37] <nitrix_live> Would the mods mind editing the title to (1.0/2.0) so it's more obvious that's his score?
[2022-12-26 13:06:43] <ネボ (ayoub_nevo)> @ネボ Can you choose who you're playing or are the looking for about equal points matchups?
