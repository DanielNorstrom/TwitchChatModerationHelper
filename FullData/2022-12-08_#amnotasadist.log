[2022-12-08 21:54:20] <+GamingJeremiah08> Yea. I felt like it was a fair price. Might have been able to get more selling on eBay or something, but figured selling to them was quick and easy. I will be getting enough to get a Nintendo Switch combo (system with game), a new Pok√©mon game, and some accessories or another game. Haven‚Äôt decided.
