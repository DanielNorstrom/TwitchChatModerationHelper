[2022-12-27 02:42:59] <%Awasd999> just because mercy is with genji in a relationship, he deserve to get nerfed more

[2022-12-27 02:46:12] <@%Grimstab77> I don't think there's actual couples inside overwatch. All the relationship we heard about were outside overwatch organization
[2022-12-27 02:46:14] <malik189_> Isn‚Äôt it like that mercy took care of genji when he was dying and such and generally took good care of him and thats why they understand each other so good
[2022-12-27 02:46:25] <@%Grimstab77> @fartsmeller4 don't be mean

[2022-12-27 04:40:01] <%Subconscious__> If you think about it it‚Äôs better that it‚Äôs not in the shop cause you could have paid $10 for the battlepass and unlocked it instead of whatever crazy price they‚Äôd put it for in the shop lsubcoSip lsubcoSip

[2022-12-27 05:08:28] <AtlantisPrince> There are no hard-counters in Overwatch. That's why such a list is always very extensive, and you will end up more confused if you just read that instead of just trying for yourself.

[2022-12-27 06:36:11] <@%Grimstab77> @Nalithea it's good to work on your problems and to think about it BUT ONLY IF you can do something about it. If you've already done everything that you need. You should drop it from the stress balance.
[2022-12-27 06:36:47] <BakaNekoNyaa> I really understand very little English, but I'll stay listening to your strim and watching it occasionally while I'm ranked
[2022-12-27 06:37:16] <@%+zyron999> Sometimes it's not easy to ignore things out of your control. I had a really bad life situation like 5 years ago and it dragged on me real hard for a long time.

[2022-12-27 07:02:16] <@%Grimstab77> Yes drops are finally live
[2022-12-27 07:02:26] <%Subconscious__> A lot of times bans are carried out by an automated system. which can result in unnecessary bans that people have to appeal so a real person at twitch can review it.  but again you haven't done anything that would get you banned. they can look through all your streams and wouldn't find any reason to ban you. It's going to be alright Nali, you're gonna get through this! nalithLove nalithLove nalithPopcorn
