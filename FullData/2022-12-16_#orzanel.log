[2022-12-16 08:54:02] <@^Nightbot> Very annoying light tank, view range is kinda low, speed is good, gun handling is good but has crappy salvo shot which ruins the tank entirely. Can only hit close stationary targets or you need to yolo and circle enemies. Overall not worth it.

[2022-12-16 12:43:24] <@^Nightbot> If you are new to WoT, use these tips: 1. Dont rush tiers. 2. Dont use mods, especially XVM. 3. Stick to Russian heavies for a start to learn game better, sidescraping, angling etc. 4. Dont buy high tier premium tanks, until you play regular tanks in that tier. 5. Watch this stream to become better player, watch my positioning on the maps and listen to what i say because i explain what i'm doing B) . Watch Wargaming videos about game mechanics
