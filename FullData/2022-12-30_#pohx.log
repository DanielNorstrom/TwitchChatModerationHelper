[2022-12-30 00:00:51] <adolebitque> Could just yolo annul as well to see if you can get an empty slot to craft something on if you think the ring is "so-so" but would be "good enough" given a bench craft

[2022-12-30 00:04:19] <adolebitque> From what I can tell (I haven't played trade this league so take this with a grain of salt) you can legit make a profit just fracturing desirable mods on items with how much people are up charging for good fracture bases
[2022-12-30 00:04:32] <+chunglyy> This is not profitable if everyone does it
[2022-12-30 00:04:45] <8arii> no its ok you just buyed me this ring and your name was familiar so i check and i learn all ok :D
[2022-12-30 00:04:51] <mcpiller> I´ll buy the topaz, whats your @ ?

[2022-12-30 00:12:28] <adolebitque> Almost all of their moves seem like they have a very exaggerated, sometimes long (not walways) windup and large aoe to their front
[2022-12-30 00:12:34] <adolebitque> So dashing behind them seems to be the play
[2022-12-30 00:12:41] <adolebitque> When they start an animation, anyway
[2022-12-30 00:13:37] <blarsto> why do you want major afflictions?

[2022-12-30 00:32:20] <ChaosOmega> you need totems in every melee build
[2022-12-30 00:32:25] <+PongLenis213> @Lyrantes @quor405 legends
[2022-12-30 00:32:34] <Lyrantes> Oh, thought Totem AS the main damage source
[2022-12-30 00:32:34] <ChaosOmega> it's like 50% extra damage for your build
[2022-12-30 00:32:37] <mcpiller> Just bought a 17% fire multi sceptre so that might be it
[2022-12-30 00:32:39] <sirgregoryadams> @PongLenis213 tl:dr... there isn't (sorry)
[2022-12-30 00:32:40] <%SearingDarkness> RF is prob the only one unless you mean hits
[2022-12-30 00:32:56] <+PongLenis213> hmm
[2022-12-30 00:32:58] <mcpiller> might do the switch for bossing, guessing the chaos res is big against bosses
[2022-12-30 00:32:59] <R34Ivern> could scion ever go rf?
[2022-12-30 00:33:12] <Lyrantes> I mean you kinda just press the totem and then go to town.. and you dont even use them when clearing
[2022-12-30 00:33:19] <+quor405> i feel like totems on melee is like Animated Guardian on minion. its just a think you have to do
[2022-12-30 00:33:44] <adolebitque> Time for Raider RF

[2022-12-30 16:09:13] <murris> Btw pohx. Just started my first hc char in quite some time. Decided to go with your jugg rf. U said something last night about you going softcore this season that I didn’t quite understand, why did you go sc? And, do you have any recommendations regarding your 3,20 build guide when it comes to making it more towards HC and also for someone like me who don’t like having to care too much about avoiding boss mechanics :D…

[2022-12-30 16:43:10] <@%lemoncoolers> because asenath's combined with a curse on hit ring means both curses are being applied at the exact same time, thus defaulting to that alphabetical rule to determine which gets applied. @dono

[2022-12-30 16:48:34] <Terradoss> I was today years old when I learned blight towers do not work offscreen.
[2022-12-30 16:48:35] <adolebitque> It's  resource saving method that doesn't really work for a tower defense minigame
[2022-12-30 16:48:36] <+booth8604> yea its like 2 or 3 screens
[2022-12-30 16:48:38] <+glubw> and i play poe for some years now.. but never done blight content actually
[2022-12-30 16:48:46] <!+Jadeon77> it's def not 3 screens
[2022-12-30 16:48:51] <!+Jadeon77> it's about a screen and a half 2 max
[2022-12-30 16:48:56] <%Motarkus> yeah keep the towers close to the pump. for me it feels like 2 screens tops
[2022-12-30 16:49:01] <%$RiverSaves> that makes so much more sense now... fuck me

[2022-12-30 17:29:11] <adolebitque> Yeah
[2022-12-30 17:29:18] <@%lemoncoolers> basically the only "rule" with rog crafting is if the upgrade won't brick the item, take it because otherwise it increases the cost of the next one

[2022-12-30 17:36:44] <+Gydion> hi Pohx I've been following your guide and it's got me back into PoE thank you! I've today got 7 divine orbs should I invest in a Brass Dome as the first big upgrade?
[2022-12-30 17:36:47] <firkkoh> Is there an easy way to find high lvl flasks ? I'd like to craft but mine are way too low lvl
[2022-12-30 17:37:17] <+Gydion> thank you!
[2022-12-30 17:37:44] <tawil_at_umr> other good use for rog is weapon crafting btw, I got cheap +1 sceptre with t1 burn dmg for him @Pohx
[2022-12-30 17:37:45] <adolebitque> The confusion about finding high ilevel flasks comes from the fact that neversink and most other filters will not show normal flasks in high tier maps, because they're usually trash
[2022-12-30 17:37:54] <+FiveThreefold> I followed your guide until i made about 20 divs then stupidly switched to some BS, now I'm going back to RF cuz it felt better xD thanks for the guide

[2022-12-30 17:38:02] <Noed22> stupid question incoming, all i need to sustain RF is max fire res and lef regen yeah?

[2022-12-30 17:38:48] <Noed22> oh shit theres a whole site for it, thanks! im so blind
[2022-12-30 17:38:50] <%+Xuletz> @lemoncoolers is there a source for what you said earlier that cast speed affects throw speed at 50%? all I can find is that they're separate stats that don't interact unless you use a unique item
[2022-12-30 17:38:50] <@%lemoncoolers> @Noed22 79% fire res and adequate regen
[2022-12-30 17:38:50] <bienebummsebiene> First time i play RF and got big hit with the essence of horror xD
[2022-12-30 17:38:55] <%flamebate> i'm always surprised by how slowly my life degends in no regen maps
[2022-12-30 17:39:01] <bienebummsebiene> ty for your guides btw^^
[2022-12-30 17:39:34] <@%lemoncoolers> I thought you were talking about the increased cost of rog. Didn't know you were talking about throw speed lol @Xuletz

[2022-12-30 17:42:25] <denipon> yea i love expedition tbh, its really fun
[2022-12-30 17:42:27] <%warmaha> Curent RF jugg build is really strong for casual players who does not trade. I can do T15-T16 maps if looking what to roll, even when not done any trading.
[2022-12-30 17:42:28] <thebwana> Nah mostly tree now for suppress
[2022-12-30 17:42:35] <@%lemoncoolers> pick raider it makes it way easier to cap suppress
[2022-12-30 17:42:39] <%+brizeno1> if you can get 60 on tree your good
[2022-12-30 17:42:55] <rony6634> @Pohx do u recommend mageblood on high budget rf?
[2022-12-30 17:42:57] <abettercreed> this is my first league in history i have 100% spell suppress and 75% chaos res

[2022-12-30 17:43:07] <adolebitque> Are you trying to grind Maven at all at this point?
[2022-12-30 17:43:11] <%warmaha> For me many things are now more fun than earlier, because build works differently
[2022-12-30 17:43:12] <thebwana> I'm capped suppress with none on gear I think
[2022-12-30 17:43:13] <jok7063> once you get mageblood from gwen.. you will love it more
[2022-12-30 17:43:18] <denipon> who knows why i died xdd
[2022-12-30 17:43:39] <PuddiPuddiPuddi> you could probably make some jug build based on that low level suppresion helmet that recovers hp on supression

[2022-12-30 17:44:50] <%warmaha> There should be stats what damages was top when died... Some other ARPGs have that.
[2022-12-30 17:44:50] <Noed22> it does true damage Kappa
[2022-12-30 17:44:51] <%jibanthamum> isnt it lightning damage?
[2022-12-30 17:44:59] <@%lemoncoolers> @jibanthamum no that's it's spitting attack

[2022-12-30 17:45:28] <adolebitque> For getting a lot of maven writs, I found that getting the beyond nodes is very powerful as you can farm a ton of breach stones even at low tiers. It's not what I was doing, but I've specced to breach on my late game grind and I found myself swimming in breachstones and figured it'd be a good way to get maven fights if you do the breach boss invitaitons

[2022-12-30 17:48:59] <adolebitque> RF Jugg is by far the easiest character I've played to push to 100 and the other ones are almost passively done
[2022-12-30 17:49:20] <%+brizeno1> I mean, he WANTS you to go outside of your way to discover how you died, he is like "You want to improve go find yourself"
[2022-12-30 17:49:46] <%+brizeno1> I disagree with the take but eh It is cancerous alt tabbing 50x
[2022-12-30 17:49:48] <adolebitque> Can you imagine even the PoE devs don't know what Stygians do with their DD and that's why they can't do death logs KEKW

[2022-12-30 17:50:28] <denipon> Yea, that's what CW said last year in a podcast. That in the end it would give information on final hit only, which wouldn't be clear to players on the actual death cause. (eg, crits, savage hits, etc that put you  in that precarious state)

[2022-12-30 18:00:46] <smoczakula93> good luck playing RF this league xD
[2022-12-30 18:01:25] <%warmaha> @Kibabeshimi So, not worst, but not easy :D Could change maybe things a bit to run those better

[2022-12-30 18:03:17] <L1ger> benevolent is a minor one i believe
[2022-12-30 18:03:20] <+LesgoBR> you dont need to use the accursed fountain too
[2022-12-30 18:03:38] <%durianBOSS> minor boon for benevolent. major for radiant i think
[2022-12-30 18:03:41] <heinz_franz> @Pohx is the vroci tech the best way to offcolor the chest or is there an alternative option ,

[2022-12-30 18:04:36] <%warmaha> I love roguelike games, but this sanctum thing is like bullet hell which I do not like...
[2022-12-30 18:04:52] <Thanatos_IRL> EZ
[2022-12-30 18:05:01] <ZeroCloud_> for the gloves implicit, are rares considered a unique enemy? or is it only map and guardian/pinnacle bosses @Pohx
[2022-12-30 18:05:27] <L1ger> go for armor/es chests for your 1st chest for easy colors
[2022-12-30 18:05:34] <%warmaha> Different time roguelike and league would have been big thing for me :)

[2022-12-30 19:30:37] <TheLaranjo> RF was my first character to get  past 90 in hardcore
[2022-12-30 19:30:37] <Ninjakens> imo the rest skills need a similar treatment to RF

[2022-12-30 19:30:49] <zoogy2006> I think it is more likely fire trap gets neffed in some way and we need to find a better single target skill.
[2022-12-30 19:30:56] <+Deedledo> yup, and he is right too, the area was like right arounf the char....it was soooo small aoe

[2022-12-30 19:38:43] <Dream__Forge> @Dougizzle ah interessting. i thought maybe you make enough dmg if you stack all the firedots together. RF, flamewall, ray, firetrap
[2022-12-30 19:38:52] <Oct0_Pus> it should be mana cost, because there is no such thing as an ES cost
[2022-12-30 19:38:59] <TheLaranjo> EB protects "mana damage", independently if it's cost or damage taken through MoM
[2022-12-30 19:39:08] <TheLaranjo> So it should work exactly like MoM

[2022-12-30 20:03:38] <+PendingTTV> anyone know why you don't go aegis melding on jugg? is it just overkill for damage reduction? I did jugg for league start this time and noticed the build doesn't require it

[2022-12-30 20:05:04] <totalsanity12> in your build notes for rf jugg it says to use lifetap before swift affliction but i dont quite understand why
[2022-12-30 20:05:25] <@%lemoncoolers> @totalsanity12 lifetap adds the duration tag to RF, swift affliction only applies to skills with duration
[2022-12-30 20:05:36] <+PendingTTV> I've liked running jugg this league, but the damage loss over inquisitor is rather noticable
[2022-12-30 20:05:49] <+Missngo> hi pohx, do you know if its possible to filter an item by the armor base percentile in filter blade? im trying to find a 100% base armor helm or gloves before i craft on them
[2022-12-30 20:05:54] <totalsanity12> oh thats an interesting interaction well..makes sense now then XD
[2022-12-30 20:05:56] <%Moxsy> heyo
[2022-12-30 20:06:04] <iJustMario> but the problem is that lifetap only gives 19% more dmg no ?

[2022-12-30 20:19:56] <+Fryssa1> @pohx He used about 8.5k alts and 5k augs rolling over 70 +1 mods until he finally hit +1 all spells on the dot fracture then regal suffix (perfect at that point to continue crafting) and he did suffix cannot be changed instead of prefix and scoured it, lost the +1 and was about to quit league D:

[2022-12-30 20:19:59] <+SmokeForce> my thought would be malevolence>skitterbots dps, but when you get res & ailment immunity set up you don't need purity anymore
[2022-12-30 20:20:12] <Swagggehhh> Okay, I lied I actually have the Reservation Efficiency point. It's a bit weird, I have 34.97% Reservation on Determination 42.37 on Purity of Elements and 42.37 on Malevolance

[2022-12-30 20:23:00] <+Deedledo> @SingaBinga can harvest swap the map
[2022-12-30 20:23:00] <+Fryssa1> @SingaBinga I think harvest has a mod to reroll corrupted maps or something like that
[2022-12-30 20:23:04] <+ChiefxThief> what d2 build do you recommend
[2022-12-30 20:23:07] <iQimo> @Pohx eater of worlds node (mana reservation)
[2022-12-30 20:23:22] <%+Xuletz> @singabinga either harvest reroll corrupted map or risk it with a tainted chaos orb
[2022-12-30 20:23:29] <Swagggehhh> No worries, I'll ask in the discord chat, thanks a lot :)
[2022-12-30 20:23:31] <Wisteriaz> @Pohx why do we use a ruby flask even with 85% max fire res?
[2022-12-30 20:23:34] <%+SingaBinga> Got it, ty all
[2022-12-30 20:23:35] <hahavia> you cannot have eater on influenced item
[2022-12-30 20:23:36] <+Kal_lmn> I finally got my first divine and wasted it on a good stygian vise... problem is that the last roll on it was "remove burn/ignite on flask use" which I didn't know what it would do at that time.
[2022-12-30 20:23:47] <+Fryssa1> @Swagggehhh whats ur ID?

[2022-12-30 21:21:23] <Shagath> you just have resolve
[2022-12-30 21:21:26] <Shagath> get over with it
[2022-12-30 21:21:39] <Shagath> joking. sorry
[2022-12-30 21:21:55] <%SearingDarkness> Do you have something that is giving you % increased max resolve? Like on boss kill
[2022-12-30 21:22:08] <+Kal_lmn> no
[2022-12-30 21:22:12] <adolebitque> That one might be major
[2022-12-30 21:22:13] <hazzqt> is it really worth divining your immortal flesh for more regen
[2022-12-30 21:22:14] <adolebitque> so everything unknown
[2022-12-30 21:22:16] <+Kal_lmn> room type unknown is what you are thinking
[2022-12-30 21:22:23] <imlpwnyi> okey thanks alot!
[2022-12-30 21:22:54] <adolebitque> I can check
[2022-12-30 21:23:00] <%+Sadisticmgt> On trade league just buy a better one. They're way cheaper than 1 div unless you need perfect rols.
[2022-12-30 21:23:05] <+Kal_lmn> One is room, one is room type. Room type is minor and not too bad, this one is horrid
[2022-12-30 21:23:07] VIEWERS: 884
[2022-12-30 21:23:14] <Shagath> I can say one thing. good regen is always good whatever the game or level
[2022-12-30 21:23:36] <adolebitque> "I thought that it would only hide the room name but it hides all information on all rooms. The only thing you can tell is whether or not you will gain an affliction from entering the room."
[2022-12-30 21:23:39] <adolebitque> So yeah it's the major downside

[2022-12-30 21:24:27] <%+mrp1nk_live> Doesn't that affect your ability to gain Inspiration from afflictions?
[2022-12-30 21:24:32] <adolebitque> It's not @VincereSBG
[2022-12-30 21:24:37] <Cheezygarter> you still see reward I blieve
[2022-12-30 21:24:40] <adolebitque> He doesn't
[2022-12-30 21:24:46] <+Kal_lmn> hey, if you take it and it bricks your run, you can showcase that as knowledge is power, lol

[2022-12-30 21:25:01] <adolebitque> If you want I can link a reddit thread talking about the affliction
[2022-12-30 21:25:01] <%SearingDarkness> It's major so I doubt it lets you see anything
[2022-12-30 21:25:01] <%VincereSBG> pretty sure you ccan see reward, just removes the name of the room
[2022-12-30 21:25:04] <hazzqt> learning DansGame
[2022-12-30 21:25:05] <+Kal_lmn> I know its majorly bad tho

[2022-12-30 21:37:54] <%+Sadisticmgt> I just don't like when videos auto-play.
[2022-12-30 21:37:54] <+Vesticle> you said 2 was no autoplay
[2022-12-30 21:37:56] <+liujordan> 2 not auto right?

[2022-12-30 21:38:01] <GregRamner> You said 2 is no auto
[2022-12-30 21:38:02] <Kait0o> 2 was not auto
[2022-12-30 21:38:05] <JoeyNumbers_> You switched the options, nobody wants auto play
[2022-12-30 21:38:06] <+PopPopBang> you said 2 was no auto

[2022-12-30 21:38:22] <%idiotslayer> fliparoo nizClap
[2022-12-30 21:38:23] <%SearingDarkness> The website is literally about your stream so idk why it matters. Its not like youre embedded on something that isnt relevant
[2022-12-30 21:38:25] <adolebitque> I'm not surprised to see PohX stream on pohx dot net, but I'd be surprised to see random streamers on sites that appear unaffiliated
[2022-12-30 21:38:25] <%SpartaGus423> controversial @Pohx For swapping the numbers there
[2022-12-30 21:38:25] <+koty889> its your personal site, so i dont see the issue
[2022-12-30 21:38:27] <drpartyboymaniac> I mean if it helps you i dont care
[2022-12-30 21:38:30] <+StoweMobile> I just hate all auto-play on anything tbh
[2022-12-30 21:38:32] <%SpartaGus423> I see you
[2022-12-30 21:38:45] <+liujordan> i hate autoplay tbh
[2022-12-30 21:38:50] <%SpartaGus423> auto play isnt the best
[2022-12-30 21:38:51] <+liujordan> i enjoy your content though
[2022-12-30 21:38:51] <%SearingDarkness> @StoweMobile Well it auto plays but is auto muted
[2022-12-30 21:38:54] <+PopPopBang> autoplay is better for you but as a viewer its cancer tbh
[2022-12-30 21:38:55] <Amoebas> I have browser addon that just doesn't allow autoplay anywhere
[2022-12-30 21:39:02] <%+Delfeen> Then again, having it autoplay is benefitial to you?
[2022-12-30 21:39:10] <%SpartaGus423> it is
[2022-12-30 21:39:14] <%+Delfeen> Cause the website is free. It's a way of supporting the content
[2022-12-30 21:39:17] <%SpartaGus423> more views

[2022-12-30 21:39:22] <+bamorgan13> Can you autoplay muted?
[2022-12-30 21:39:27] <%+Delfeen> I mean... it'd be the bare minimum, right?
[2022-12-30 21:39:32] <%SpartaGus423> @Pohx Honestly your guide has been the best thing ever
[2022-12-30 21:39:33] <GregRamner> I like that you talked to Ziz about it and are having this discussion, regardless of what you choose :)
[2022-12-30 21:39:36] <%+Sadisticmgt> Yeah, autoplay muted would be fine for sure.
[2022-12-30 21:39:38] <+liujordan> autoplay muted i'd like
[2022-12-30 21:39:41] <%+Delfeen> Yeah, autoplay it muted would possibly be a good compromise
[2022-12-30 21:39:47] <iHirux> it was
[2022-12-30 21:39:47] <+Winzor> It is your own site, this is a business. I would say it hurts no one and if it helps your overall growth.  You are providing a service of the site so why not autoplay IMO. unless your some kind of charity. :)
[2022-12-30 21:39:48] <!%+Jadeon77> It was already autoplay muted, I changed it to not autoplay at all.
[2022-12-30 21:39:56] <+ugottbag> i see it being that it being your website. do what youu want with it
[2022-12-30 21:40:00] <@%+Ardvatar> wait what is the issue
[2022-12-30 21:40:00] <iQimo> @Pohx now u have soul of arakaali or brine king?
[2022-12-30 21:40:05] <@%+Ardvatar> because it bumps your numbers?
[2022-12-30 21:40:06] <%vianadota> I just learned what forbidden flame does ;)
[2022-12-30 21:40:07] <HypnotizedBird> Azmongold have a video about embed stream. he said he would do it 100% if he knew how
[2022-12-30 21:40:08] <!%+Jadeon77> The difference here is that this is your personal website, and thus I feel autoplay is fine.
[2022-12-30 21:40:12] <@%+Ardvatar> ah okay

[2022-12-30 21:40:24] <drpartyboymaniac> Boxing match between ziz and pohx ?!
[2022-12-30 21:40:38] <@%+Ardvatar> I think its fine
[2022-12-30 21:40:52] <%+mrp1nk_live> I mean....I watched the stream where Ziz blew up about it and he was kinda baby rage. Said some pretty harsh things about how he felt about it. Then again at least you had an adult convo with him regarding it.
[2022-12-30 21:41:12] <+zudood> They can make their own website if they feel it is unfair
[2022-12-30 21:41:17] VIEWERS: 905
[2022-12-30 21:41:18] <Amoebas> The issue is when it's on CoE or elsewhere, almost hidden, not when it's on streamer's own site
[2022-12-30 21:41:32] <Gigex9> Your stream is only on the home page right now ?
[2022-12-30 21:41:33] <@%+Ardvatar> You've built an incredible resource, for free, that costs you money to run. Leaving it on is fine.
[2022-12-30 21:41:35] <!%+Jadeon77> It's 100% their choice not to follow suit with what you have done to build your brand.
[2022-12-30 21:41:44] <%+mrp1nk_live> IMO, it's not your problem to deal with. Twitch needs to be better about how they show viewership.
[2022-12-30 21:41:45] <kayleth_> i dont understand how its unfair? didnt you make the website and pay to host it?
[2022-12-30 21:41:50] <%+Sadisticmgt> Not trying to be disrespectful, but why does it matter what other content creators think about it?
[2022-12-30 21:41:53] <!%+Jadeon77> If it were a site like Craft of Exile very different
[2022-12-30 21:41:58] <+RazorEater> Autoplay it.
[2022-12-30 21:42:21] <+zudood> You put the time and money into making the site so I see it has fair for you to embed your stream
[2022-12-30 21:42:24] <@%+Ardvatar> Do any other POE content creators have similar websites or resources?
[2022-12-30 21:42:25] <+koty889> if theres no respect you wouldnt have ppl like jungroan popping in this morning
[2022-12-30 21:42:43] <adolebitque> Also being a content creator can be hard if you become a pariah, so keeping good relations with peers is advantageous
[2022-12-30 21:42:45] <!%+Jadeon77> Everything that exists on the website i've built has been requested by this community, and that stie is built for this community.
[2022-12-30 21:42:49] <@%+Ardvatar> I see no reason to not have it on then.
[2022-12-30 21:42:50] <kayleth_> but shouldnt you be allowed to benefit from your hard work making a website to help people?
[2022-12-30 21:43:03] <Gigex9> I wouldn't mind it auto play (unmute) it can tell people you're live, it support you and if I don't want it I can stop it
[2022-12-30 21:43:05] <%+brizeno1> TriPolarBear and a group has been making one no? it isnt as detailed about one build tho

[2022-12-30 21:44:05] <%SearingDarkness> @Pohx I think that since it's front and center on the page and not a side popup I would agree. I still stand by it being a website built on top of your stream but its not a big deal

[2022-12-30 21:45:02] <Illumina> I know the whole fextralife wiki autoplays their twitch channel, that's a lot of fake views
[2022-12-30 21:45:06] <+DennehTTV> oh okay
[2022-12-30 21:45:10] <Kait0o> Hey Pohx should I tryhard higher tier maps (12-16) or make lower tiers but faster and without problems? What's more preferable to gain currency faster (I mean trade league)

[2022-12-30 21:46:38] <%SearingDarkness> Yeah thats why I think your site is different because its so innately tied into you as a streamer
[2022-12-30 21:46:47] <denial55> how u doin today?
[2022-12-30 21:47:10] <Illumina> it's more forgivable for you because the website is literally named pohx.net, seeing you in the corner makes a little sense

[2022-12-30 21:47:50] <!%+Jadeon77> If CraftOfExile.com were (THEY ARE NOT ) embedding streamers in hidden frames that were muted and doing it on a pay2play basis that would be wrong.  If the creator of CraftOfExile wanted to embed his own stream in his own website 100% more power to him.

[2022-12-30 21:49:35] <poggazoo> if the frame isnt hidden idgaf
[2022-12-30 21:49:38] <+liujordan> its a lot worse when you host community content on your website but promote your stream specifically

[2022-12-30 21:50:42] <%SearingDarkness> Having it not autoplay but still having it embedded is probably the best compromise we could have for this without people being bitchy

[2022-12-30 21:51:51] <!%+Jadeon77> That 100% depends on what his stream content is.  If his stream is related to what he's doing with craft of exile it's still 100% legit
[2022-12-30 21:51:57] <@%lemoncoolers> pohx has done it in the most justified and ethical way possible. If anyone is hating on the way pohx does it, they're very few and far between.
[2022-12-30 21:51:57] <+RazorEater> People low on bandwidth or something?
[2022-12-30 21:52:09] <adolebitque> If I had to put it into words, your website's guide "continues" and "spills over" onto the stream you're doing here, so it's natural that a user would get directed to the stream, where they will probably end up anyway to ask about their auras and mana reservation
[2022-12-30 21:52:09] <firstpiao> Mr @Pohx how did you acquire 6link from ssf?

[2022-12-30 21:52:55] <raptorxer0> PREACH
[2022-12-30 21:53:00] <%SearingDarkness> Basically the website needs to be a long winded way of being a stream overlay/tool LUL
[2022-12-30 21:53:02] <AeroFantasia> A very good exmaple of this I can bring is Dark Souls Extralife wiki. Extralife is a small group of people (and the community) who edits and puts info onto the wiki. However they have stream autoplay for random diffrent games that aren't even connected to their stream and they dont care about people's questions on the wiki making them much less favored the the communites of the games with their autoplay stream stuff.
[2022-12-30 21:53:07] <Dafnix1> Madge
[2022-12-30 21:53:11] <@%lemoncoolers> @Illumina this is true which is why it should be visible and closable
[2022-12-30 21:53:18] VIEWERS: 895
[2022-12-30 21:53:18] <+rafiluku> but its the same with build someone see phox rf he doesnt who you are doesnt care he wants the build speeaking abaut freshh guy @Pohx
[2022-12-30 21:53:36] <!%+Jadeon77> I agree with you there are shady ways twitch embeds are being used/abused, and there are ways that are completely legit.  Just like you can click on it to start it, you can click on ti to stop it.
[2022-12-30 21:53:42] <!%+Jadeon77> It's when you cant because the frame is hidden thats the issue
[2022-12-30 21:53:46] <+nebuchenazarr> I agree with all you are saying, overall the issue for me is that the majority of streamers are saying : if i cant have it, noone can have it, regardless of the context of use or the way its set up. To be it makes no sense, there are valid reasons to embed, this is, from my point of view, one of them.
[2022-12-30 21:53:49] <ynn67> i have drop a Cinderswallow Flask was good for an RF ?
[2022-12-30 21:53:57] <@%+Ardvatar> thats fine
[2022-12-30 21:54:01] <!%+Jadeon77> I'd be fine with taht
[2022-12-30 21:54:01] <%+mrp1nk_live> @Pohx I think the biggest issue from others' point of view is how it affects your position in the category. And how it can affect your sponsorship deals (if any). Which I think doesn't really have as big as an effect as people are making it seem.
[2022-12-30 21:54:01] <%+Delfeen> Thats fine
[2022-12-30 21:54:01] <+RazorEater> fine
[2022-12-30 21:54:03] <+ugottbag> id be okay with that. he made the site
[2022-12-30 21:54:04] <+Winzor> Its his site he can do it.
[2022-12-30 21:54:06] <Majki1> i think people generaly hate autoplay, coz of ads that autoplay when you open a website
[2022-12-30 21:54:07] <Cozo1> Gaming is the only business it's accepted to create advanced systems and not provide a manual LUL
[2022-12-30 21:54:14] <ZarknBOOM> I think there is a big difference between advertising your stream, and embedding your stream on the landing page when the website is advertised as a "RF Wiki". I think the argument changes if you change your website landing page from an RF guide to an introduction to your content and had a different tab for RF content
[2022-12-30 21:54:41] <%SearingDarkness> His content IS RF tho
[2022-12-30 21:54:47] <@%+Ardvatar> If you created a website and you want to plug your stream on it, your livelihood, then you can. There's no rules saying no. If people don't like it they can create their own website, have it explode like pohx.net, and then add their stream.
[2022-12-30 21:55:13] <@%+Ardvatar> I understand why people may NOT like it that are other creators
[2022-12-30 21:55:16] <@%+Ardvatar> but

[2022-12-30 21:55:21] <adolebitque> Also I'd like to point out that PohX's stream is relevant to his website, because new users *will* flock to his stream to get things clarified
[2022-12-30 21:55:22] <%+mrp1nk_live> 100%, agree. People are going to your site because they know about you.
[2022-12-30 21:55:22] <+Winzor> 100% agree with Ardvatar.

[2022-12-30 21:56:03] <+lAmTheLiquor> roll out
[2022-12-30 21:56:04] <+nebuchenazarr> For sure you have all the right to embed your stream on your own website, theres no arguing that. But lets take method for example, they embed their streamers, they have guides on there, and noone make a fuss about it (and they do feature PoE streamers). But ghazzy giving crafting advice on CoE crosses a line?
[2022-12-30 21:56:05] <!%+Jadeon77> But  i usually just sit here and troll pohx
[2022-12-30 21:56:10] <%VincereSBG> how is Jadeon not a mod?
[2022-12-30 21:56:18] <%SearingDarkness> @Jadeon77 How much work is it to get the twitch chat to be next to the embed? Could have autoplay off except for a tab that says "Pohx Stream" or something and that would further push the validity maybe
[2022-12-30 21:56:29] <Majki1> @Jadeon77 great job with the site cohhL
[2022-12-30 21:56:32] <%SearingDarkness> I code but I havent fucked with twitch embeds n shit
[2022-12-30 21:56:35] <poggazoo> i think the whole ghazzy thing is blown out of proportions
[2022-12-30 21:56:43] <%GrandSentinel> Embed on your own website makes sense because people are going there specifically for your content @Pohx
[2022-12-30 21:56:55] <!%+Jadeon77> @SearingDarkness It's a matter of the controls that twitch themselves gives to embeds.  Atm I am keeping the embed very light and simple per Pohx's request.

[2022-12-30 22:05:25] <%SearingDarkness> For Twitch Drops if the stream is muted you dont get drops so we KNOW they have the tech to stop you from being counted as a viewer when its auto muted 🤷 twitch is the source of the issues

[2022-12-30 22:12:53] <Amoebas> I was watching Sanctum guid and the guy was saying bosses hit both resolve and inspiration simultaneously, and your HP too.

[2022-12-30 22:13:16] <%+l4mpi> probably worded that way because it only affects resolve / inspiration and isn't 40% less health / es damage

[2022-12-30 22:34:19] <+Fryssa1> Yes you do
[2022-12-30 22:34:28] <Doomzx> so first execute them for ranks and then interrogate as soon as they hit 3 star i guess
[2022-12-30 22:34:33] <Doomzx> thanks <3
[2022-12-30 22:34:37] <+Fryssa1> Yup if you don't care about them for cata

[2022-12-30 22:35:52] <%JackOfNoTrades> from your experience, does the pack size atlas from the command self sustain maps or do you need to buy some from time to time?
[2022-12-30 22:35:58] <%Christoforator> is there a way to turn off RF other than with a flask?
