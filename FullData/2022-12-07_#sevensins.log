[2022-12-07 12:55:35] <@%^GilgamEXP> SevenSins --> !natural already exists and can not be added again.
[2022-12-07 12:55:39] <~%SevenSins> !natural
[2022-12-07 12:55:40] <@%^GilgamEXP> Natural Jobs means that Bartz can only use Jobs from the Wind Crystal (Knight, White Mage, Black Mage et cetera), Lenna can only use Jobs from the Water Crystal (Red Mage, Summoner et cetera) and so on. Before you get the Jobs, you are forced to use Freelancer. *After* you get those Jobs, you are never allowed to use Freelancer again.

[2022-12-07 13:23:31] <%Neonlare> It's wild when you realize that leveling in FF5 is a straight multiplier of your class stats
[2022-12-07 13:23:41] <%$RaptorGesus> Good Morning Seven and Sinners. Did I just miss the ending of FF IV?
[2022-12-07 13:23:49] <%Neonlare> I remember reading up on this and apparently each level is like an additional multiplier to your job stats
[2022-12-07 13:23:56] <%$Anak761> FFV is such a great game, it's hard at first but there is so much hiding in the game that breaks it
[2022-12-07 13:23:58] <%XyFreak> @RaptorGesus yep
[2022-12-07 13:24:01] <%Neonlare> so if your intellect is like, 10, and you're level 10, the actual stat is something like, 100?
[2022-12-07 13:24:08] <%Neonlare> It's not an exact 1:1 multlpier
[2022-12-07 13:24:18] <%Neonlare> but it's **intense**
[2022-12-07 13:24:25] <%$RaptorGesus> Well congrats ðð
[2022-12-07 13:24:30] <%Neonlare> Yeah it's why the Old status effect is so brutal in this game
[2022-12-07 13:24:50] VIEWERS: 471
[2022-12-07 13:24:56] <%Neonlare> Reducing you back down to level 1 is a hard, hard effect
[2022-12-07 13:25:13] <%$Anak761> would have been fun to see Old come back in later games
[2022-12-07 13:25:23] <%Neonlare> I think it did as a different name

[2022-12-07 13:25:29] <%Nightscamp> It never appears again right?
[2022-12-07 13:26:04] <%Neonlare> the plot of FF5 may be the most Saturday Morning Cartoon nonsense there is, but my god the game is just

[2022-12-07 13:26:37] <%+Syder87> Exdeath is a very deep character Kappa
[2022-12-07 13:26:49] <%Neonlare> ExDeath is hillarious because of how cornball the guy is
[2022-12-07 13:26:50] VIEWERS: 480
[2022-12-07 13:27:31] <%Nightscamp> FF5 in general isnt too serious its a fun time
[2022-12-07 13:27:41] <%Lonefellow> I thought ExDeath was perfectly voiced. It's exactly how I imagined a huge tree
[2022-12-07 13:28:00] <%Neonlare> yeah he's very serious and overly dark in Dissidia
[2022-12-07 13:28:11] <%tcmatthews_jr> ExDeath really likes to get his roots deep in plots
[2022-12-07 13:28:23] <%Neonlare> I find it hillarious they went with ExDeath instead of the initial intention; Exodus
[2022-12-07 13:28:30] <@%RabidAmoeba> WHELP! Obviously the Pink Tail must've been a joke sevenLUL
[2022-12-07 13:28:38] <%Neonlare> I think they landed on the notion that it translated to "ExDeath" as well as "Exodus" and thought fuck it, pick the dumber option

[2022-12-07 13:28:47] <%Lonefellow> Yeah, Ultimecia (I think) was supposed to have some Russian accent when you look at the FF8 script and you hear none of that in Dissidia

[2022-12-07 13:28:52] <@%RabidAmoeba> SeemsGood
[2022-12-07 13:29:07] <%Nightscamp> I feel Exdeath is one of those mistranslations that just stuck
[2022-12-07 13:29:13] <%Neonlare> Rydia too
[2022-12-07 13:29:18] <%Neonlare> Rydia is "meant" to be Lydia
[2022-12-07 13:29:43] <%Lonefellow> The anime said "Exodeeze".
[2022-12-07 13:29:44] <%+LinkFi> next year we get the names Ilike, Bigbuttz, Andi, Cannotlie :P
[2022-12-07 13:30:05] <%Nightscamp> Ahh the old FF5 fan translation days with Buttz and Renne
[2022-12-07 13:30:07] <%+spectr0nn> @Lonefellow theres a joke in there somewhere
[2022-12-07 13:30:11] <%Neonlare> yeah ExDeath is very silly and dumb
[2022-12-07 13:30:15] <%Neonlare> And I dig it more
[2022-12-07 13:30:17] <%Lonefellow> @spectr0nn I know Kappa
[2022-12-07 13:30:22] <%blaze800000> tall tree armor with void
[2022-12-07 13:30:39] <%Neonlare> Exodus has the biblical link. Tree of knowledge, tree of temptation, etc etc
[2022-12-07 13:30:42] <%TidusZecht> he was dead but then he wasn't so he's ex-death bggHaa
[2022-12-07 13:30:49] <%Neonlare> but ExDeath is, such a nonsense name

[2022-12-07 13:30:51] <%dj_laws> Hey Seven! Hope all is well! sevenWave
[2022-12-07 13:30:56] <%+Nervarel> The only right answer here isâ¦
[2022-12-07 13:30:56] <%Neonlare> What's it mean? Beyond Death? ExTREME Death?
[2022-12-07 13:30:59] [Points] Nervarel redeemed H0NK (5Â 000)
[2022-12-07 13:31:13] <%+spectr0nn> its basically a very metal name
[2022-12-07 13:31:23] <%Lonefellow> @Neonlare It is a super nonsense name, but it is perfectly 90s and campy. Like he's a Power Rangers villain
[2022-12-07 13:31:27] <%Nightscamp> Yeah the best thing is, is that if in the Pixel Remaster they did change it to Exodus fans would e up in arms, its straight up not his name anymore
[2022-12-07 13:31:28] <%+ReimHikari> best boy boko time!
[2022-12-07 13:31:28] <%+Syder87> I AM EXDEATH! DIE!
[2022-12-07 13:31:54] <%+Nervarel> Are there even battles in the water in this area?
[2022-12-07 13:32:01] <%Neonlare> The most frustrating thing about being in Japan is realizing that, even with a dictionary of loan words, they *still* mispell shit all the fuckin time
[2022-12-07 13:32:12] <%Neonlare> they phonetically say it out loud so you get mis-spellings in Katakana EVERYWHERE
[2022-12-07 13:32:47] <%Neonlare> The kanji has 2500 recognized characters but their phonic alphabet is much less
[2022-12-07 13:32:51] <%Lonefellow> @Nightscamp The fan translation of V I think also had X-Death and people parted with that spelling pretty quick
[2022-12-07 13:32:51] VIEWERS: 487
[2022-12-07 13:32:53] <%+Syder87> I think i appreciate how stupid and OTT Exdeath is after this chat
[2022-12-07 13:32:58] <%Neonlare> Katakana is phonetic but if I explain it people's eyes are gonna go lob-sided
[2022-12-07 13:33:10] <%BerserkNow> Good luck on the FF V bggWave
[2022-12-07 13:33:24] <%+spectr0nn> because its not phonetic
[2022-12-07 13:33:27] <%XyFreak> well katakana/hiragana - same thing (for foreign/native)
[2022-12-07 13:33:38] <%Neonlare> FF5 is absolutely a parody
[2022-12-07 13:33:48] <%Neonlare> It's absolutely a parody of RPG stories
[2022-12-07 13:33:54] <%Neonlare> FF6 is a huge deconstruction of it
[2022-12-07 13:34:04] <%Neonlare> There's so many DBZ parody bits in this game
[2022-12-07 13:34:47] <%Lonefellow> FFV is a carefree adventure set between two angsty games
[2022-12-07 13:34:49] <%Neonlare> The FF games alter and swap each game don't they

[2022-12-07 13:34:55] <%Nightscamp> Gogo's fight is pretty fun
[2022-12-07 13:34:56] <%CynniUniflame> I do love the expressions in the sprites in this game. They are the best ones
[2022-12-07 13:35:09] <%Neonlare> FF1 - Silly fun FF2 - HARDCORE SERIOUS FF3 - Silly fun FF4 - HARDCORE SERIOUS FF5 - Silly fun FF6 - HARDCORE SERIOUS
[2022-12-07 13:35:39] <%XyFreak> FF7 - Silly fun - FF8 HARDCORE SERIOUS... oh wait Kappa
[2022-12-07 13:35:44] <%+spectr0nn> im not fully sold on FF4 being hardcore serious. there's lots of goofy stuff in there too
[2022-12-07 13:36:22] <%Neonlare> FF4 literally opens up with a War Crime
[2022-12-07 13:36:26] <%CynniUniflame> wait? You guys don't hit your SO with a frying pan?
[2022-12-07 13:36:33] <%Nightscamp> Also FF1 - Have more free choice in character roles, FF2 - Set characters with names, FF3 - Have more free choice, FF4 - Set party and characters and roles, FF5 - More Freedom in roles again
[2022-12-07 13:36:34] <%Myrthus> ff4 has some good serious funny instead of goofy funny
[2022-12-07 13:36:43] <%Neonlare> Exactly @Nightscamp
[2022-12-07 13:36:51] <%+LadyStarbird> FF4 is mostly serious. Like, "Oh, you like this character? Well, they're dead now! (or at least you think they are dead)"
[2022-12-07 13:36:52] VIEWERS: 511
[2022-12-07 13:36:53] <%Neonlare> Also openness in design in general
[2022-12-07 13:36:56] <%+Syder87> Omg cynni LUL
[2022-12-07 13:37:04] <%Neonlare> FF1 has a "pick your bosses in whichever order design", FF2 is pretty regimented

[2022-12-07 13:37:26] <%Neonlare> FF3 is regimented, but there's a little bit more openness in terms of the places you can explore and go to, lots of optional areas
[2022-12-07 13:37:44] <!%$BlueSamy> They use creampuffs in the Sins household. sevenBrain

[2022-12-07 13:37:54] <%Neonlare> FF4 back to restricted chronological progression and FF5 literally gives you a final world to go explore which consists of like nearly 1/3rd of the game

[2022-12-07 16:29:00] <%BlueMageDanny> @NorthRex Usually you're good if you can apply Shell or Protect depending on the boss. Shell lets you fight the final boss at nearly half the level, since it lets you deal with Almagest much easier, and halves the ailment chances from Grand Cross
