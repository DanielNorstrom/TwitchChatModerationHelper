[2022-12-15 19:46:18] <EddieDevs> if you think you can get kills, dark seal is a must buy. it's free ap per kill but if you die, lose part of the bonus. A really good double-edged item for cheap

[2022-12-15 19:46:33] <@%^StreamElements> I'm currently playing on a whitelisted GTA V RP server called NoPixel using the FiveM client ( https://fivem.net ). If you're interested in joining, visit https://nopixel.net to apply. To answer a few questions, you do NOT need to be a streamer to play on NoPixel. You will very likely have to wait a fair amount of time to receive a response to your application given the recent influx of people interested in playing.
