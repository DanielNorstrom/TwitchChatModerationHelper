[2022-12-31 10:02:19] <@%^botbear1110> Norman_Invasion,  That depends on personal preference. Some people may prefer a six pack of abs, while others may prefer a big dumper behind. Ultimately, it is up to the individual to decide which they prefer.

[2022-12-31 10:04:39] <hippopotamus_bot> @pujzz, Hippos Are Very Vocal Creatures. Hippos are very loud and use a series of noises to communicate with one another in their groups. These sounds are quite distinct and have been described as honks, growls, whines, and squeaks. At times, it also resembles the sound of human laughter.

[2022-12-31 11:09:31] <%QUISL> bb ask whats the point in nymn when you can forsen or xqc
[2022-12-31 11:09:38] <@%^botbear1110> QUISL,  Nymn is a streamer who focuses on playing a variety of games, while Forsen and XQC are primarily focused on playing one game. Nymn also has a more relaxed and laid-back atmosphere, which can be appealing to viewers who are looking for a more casual streaming experience.
[2022-12-31 11:09:57] <%QUISL> Aware casual streamer
[2022-12-31 11:10:47] <+teknik_> bb ask how do i stop people from saying that i have schizophrenia
[2022-12-31 11:10:58] <@%^botbear1110> teknik_,  Unfortunately, there is no way to stop people from saying things about you that you don't like. The best thing you can do is to focus on your own mental health and wellbeing, and to surround yourself with people who support and respect you. If someone is saying something about you that is hurtful or untrue, you can try to talk to them about it and explain why it is not okay. If that doesn't

Some players may prefer a wife with certain characteristics, while others may prefer a different type of wife. Ultimately, it is up to the player to decide who they think is the best wife in Skyrim.

[2022-12-31 13:33:28] <@%^botbear1110> QuisL,  It is up to you. If you want to start your workout routine before January 1st, then go ahead and do so. However, if you would like to wait until after January 1st to begin your workout routine, that is also an option. Ultimately, the decision is up to you.

[2022-12-31 15:48:26] <@%^botbear1110> Kloydan,  A pot friend could faint due to a variety of reasons, such as low blood sugar, dehydration, or an underlying medical condition. It is also possible that they could faint due to the effects of the marijuana itself, such as feeling lightheaded or dizzy. If your pot friend has fainted, it is important to seek medical attention immediately.

Some of us have been sucking the mods off for months in order to get their emote added, and you just decide to purge it all. The emote economy has already been unstable due to covid and the Ukraine war and this certainly isn't helping. You are ruining careers with this shit man..

[2022-12-31 20:17:04] <@%^botbear1110> SparkClouds2,  NymN does not hate fun. NymN is a popular Twitch streamer who is known for his humorous and entertaining streams. He often plays games with his viewers and engages in lighthearted banter.

[2022-12-31 20:17:18] <@%^botbear1110> Kloydan,  The mods likely purged 3rd party emotes to ensure that the chatroom was a safe and welcoming environment for all users. Third-party emotes can often be offensive or inappropriate, and the mods wanted to ensure that the chatroom was a safe and friendly place for everyone.

[2022-12-31 20:25:19] <%Kloydan> bb ask why do people bully poros?
[2022-12-31 20:25:27] <@%^botbear1110> Kloydan,  People bully poros for a variety of reasons, including jealousy, insecurity, and a desire to feel powerful. Bullying is a form of aggression that is often used to make someone feel inferior or to gain control over them. Unfortunately, poros are often targeted because of their cute and innocent appearance, which can make them an easy target for bullies.

[2022-12-31 20:26:37] <@%^botbear1110> MrAstor,  It is impossible to predict the future, so it is impossible to say for sure whether everything will turn up okay at the end. However, it is possible to take steps to increase the chances of a positive outcome. Taking action, making positive choices, and having a positive attitude can all help to create a more favorable outcome.

[2022-12-31 22:33:25] <!%$Rexinus1> people will troll more if they know if something is about to win
[2022-12-31 22:33:38] <@%ayyybubu> just count the total votes
