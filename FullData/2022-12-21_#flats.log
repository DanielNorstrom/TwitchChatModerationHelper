[2022-12-21 00:00:17] <+GoldClassGaming> @ThySeer 99.9% of Ramattra's in bronze are gonna turbo int cuz they're going to somehow have a worse understanding of the character than the high ranked players who already don't really get him.

[2022-12-21 00:01:04] <peppo_giggle> Flats do you know how to get the rammatra silhouette?
[2022-12-21 00:01:07] <%quickburn619> Ram.. and when he gets pwned, hog.
[2022-12-21 00:01:09] <aadamsinnott> it's funny how they spent all season 1 working on the overcast blizz world just for Christmas to replace it immediately
[2022-12-21 00:01:10] <midnightmuffin12> are trollers treated the same way as cheaters if you still see them trolling ?(I.e. ask to draw)
[2022-12-21 00:01:11] <MrPunyama> @iliketoeatpineapples Lol, I have forced Winston into Hog and climbed around 1000 sr in OW1. Now it feels impossible I was stuck plat 5 until I started playing Hog and Oirsa.
[2022-12-21 00:01:12] <%+kazenblade29> I play Dva don‚Äôt care about meta

[2022-12-21 00:02:12] <%+aastorms> But mercy has a high win rate though, nothing to do with sojurn

[2022-12-21 00:02:29] <%OminousEinherjar> @goofproofmocha Havnt met as much of that as you, but in QP atleast you don't lose SR, play to have fun!
[2022-12-21 00:02:32] <%+aastorms> there can only be one storms
[2022-12-21 00:02:34] <djzander_> i rlly hope they don‚Äôt nerf mercy cuz of this whole soj situation
[2022-12-21 00:02:38] <jaeltpf> @aastorms really depends, most mercys dont solo queue and have a great dps duo
[2022-12-21 00:02:39] <@%$R3trohowling> FeelsStrongMan Getting one tapped like the old times
[2022-12-21 00:02:44] <Preston_849> i think ram is so good against orisa cos her big head gives an easy beam from his primary fire
[2022-12-21 00:02:45] <%BorkBorf> @SpaceCircus_ coomer still somehow harder to listen to tho
[2022-12-21 00:02:47] <goofproofmocha> @OminousEinherjar respawn simulator isnt fun
[2022-12-21 00:02:59] <jaeltpf> @djzander_ if they nerf mercy her dmg boost shes useless so no üòß

[2022-12-21 00:03:17] <+GoldClassGaming> @Preston_849 Orisa is solid into Ram soley because she's like the only good tank that has a way to block Nemesis.
[2022-12-21 00:03:17] <%iliketoeatpineapples> @MrPunyama hog's is just pretty annoying to kill. can't wait for that rework.

[2022-12-21 00:05:14] <+GoldClassGaming> @Preston_849 I've been playing Ram non stop since he came out. Orisa is a tricky matchup because she's just as tanky as Ramattra while also being able to block Nemesis punches and use her spear to force out of block. It's not an unwinnable matchup, but it's harder than most of the tank matchups/

[2022-12-21 00:08:53] <+GoldClassGaming> @JetBlack72 It's not getting worse it's just that Sojourn is still frustrating to play against. The balance is objectively better than it was like a wee go.

[2022-12-21 00:10:34] <ghostly4124> might be a weird question but has anyone thought about adding bans to this game?
[2022-12-21 00:10:34] <+GoldClassGaming> @Criller128 Sojourn aside, the Balance is better than it was last week. Doomfist and Tracer are no longer absolute menaces to society plus Orisa and Ana are better which helps keep Hog in check while they work on his soft rework.
[2022-12-21 00:10:34] <%Toddlesworth> who in chat even said smurf LUL

[2022-12-21 00:14:16] <+Cheesie_Muffin> this season made me want to stop playing ranked. besides the meta picks i hate how the game is against flex players now
[2022-12-21 00:14:21] <Tieboo_> They should neft genji, it's no fun anymore.

[2022-12-21 00:15:01] <+Evildee87> don't worry, probability says you'll get the better Sojourn one of these games...
[2022-12-21 00:15:02] <%+aastorms> once hog is re worked hopefully the fun will come back
[2022-12-21 00:15:04] <Multibaker> yeah i went 2-8 today, pocketed soujorn every game
[2022-12-21 00:15:07] <jaeltpf> @zealith_gamer i as a mercy main love ashe bc she can fr 2 shot them or 1 shot + dynamite and kill. If u have good aim shes amazing also for distance + bawb is good
[2022-12-21 00:15:07] <Criller128> True

[2022-12-21 00:15:13] <rphii> I think blizzard should nerf genji due to sojourn
[2022-12-21 00:15:17] <%TheTealPhoenix> Give mercy 5 more bullets and nerf genji @flats
[2022-12-21 00:15:18] <Hussain_Kazmi> they nerfed Sombra because she was killing tanks to quick but we gonna don nothing bout Sojourn?
[2022-12-21 00:15:24] <JohnKavinski> are we winning or loosing with Ramattra?

[2022-12-21 00:15:31] <ghostly4124> might be a weird idea but since she has quakes railgun why not make her m1 a shitty nailgun
[2022-12-21 00:15:31] <kdawg7157> the bots in custom game have an aimbot and ultimate difficulty sorry for saying dis message a lot
[2022-12-21 00:15:36] <$TheMartian_X> @Zealith_Gamer widow has less utility.  ashe can farm Bob super quickly with dynamite and she's good at both close/mid and long range, especially with mercy pocket

[2022-12-21 21:10:02] <%$Steven_Servo> Cheer1000 So as I understand the MM and Comp deep dive you can just have fun in QP to get your MMR up before ever playing ranked... so when you go to rank you would be placed against higher ranks which would likely help placement? Essentially grind QP, then place if you want with no real difference?

[2022-12-21 21:20:01] <%SkitzoCTRL> @ow_sigmaeats Flats has expressed his disinterest in any mint candy. Candy shouldn't taste like toothpaste.
[2022-12-21 21:20:08] <%TxMamaGaming> Snickers or Hershey bar with almonds
[2022-12-21 21:20:10] <livetwall> mars is garbage

[2022-12-21 21:21:31] <%SkitzoCTRL> @littlepeanutberry Just gonna be real, Peanut Butter M&Ms are far better than Reese's Pieces, as a person who has spent a lot of time between the two.

[2022-12-21 21:21:50] <%SkitzoCTRL> @ow_sigmaeats Babe Ruth -caramel -chocolate is Pearson's Nut Roll.
[2022-12-21 21:21:51] <hornmel> also I use Reese's chips to make fudge too with some Jiff extra crunchy thrown in

[2022-12-21 21:26:11] [Notification] whipsurmom69 gifted a Tier 1 sub to Zuggzor!
[2022-12-21 21:26:17] <mr__nacho> just started playing 2 weeks ago and finally got into ranked 3 days ago coming from paladins i felt like i could just hop in but after going 3-12 im no longer sure this game is for me lmao
[2022-12-21 21:26:18] <%SkitzoCTRL> @littlepeanutberry I don't even want her to have the headshot damage she has.
[2022-12-21 21:26:27] <%MADcees> KEKW sounds like a lot of fun
[2022-12-21 21:26:27] <%NFG_Lucky> That thing? Story time??
[2022-12-21 21:26:28] <dragonsoxx> I swear, they put in movable items just cause they new people would play around with them
[2022-12-21 21:26:30] <+brendans1818> You need 50 wins
[2022-12-21 21:26:30] <%SkitzoCTRL> @Lightning_Dove Because the life of support is totally thankless.
[2022-12-21 21:26:43] <sherpa32> you can
[2022-12-21 21:26:46] <+gaunterodimmw> @SkitzoCTRL tanks need to be strong by default i dont think it breaks the game as 1 tank allowed per team and also ball getting buffed 100% confirmed by devs
[2022-12-21 21:26:49] <+Lightning_Dove> @SkitzoCTRL lmaooo yeah thats fair
[2022-12-21 21:26:49] <%litle0ne> I main support...roadhog players I usually meet as teammates/enemies are toxic..
[2022-12-21 21:26:53] <xxpaleassnowxx> i immediately got to play rank on console even though i played on PC
[2022-12-21 21:26:58] <%robot_hero> you can but its a separate leaderboard
[2022-12-21 21:27:00] <sherpa32> you dont need 50 mmore wins
[2022-12-21 21:27:03] <%ow_sigmaeats> I guess emongg‚Äôs favorite candy is babe Ruth or licorice candy
[2022-12-21 21:27:06] <%$dookin0nya> its part of battlepass

[2022-12-21 21:27:08] <+HenyoJo> on console it has a seperate rank to pc
[2022-12-21 21:27:11] <ADesBanana> Just and instantly get 8 ads. :D
[2022-12-21 21:27:12] <%+wolff213> it wont make u do 50 if u already have 50 on a platform
[2022-12-21 21:27:12] <%hannibal314> they should make it so flex queue prioritizes you for other roles after a certain number of games played as support
[2022-12-21 21:27:14] <%flargie> yeah, i was fine to play comp on pc despite all of my time being on console
[2022-12-21 21:27:15] <%$Kafthla> What's the best way to play ball now any advice is good

[2022-12-21 21:27:53] <%SkitzoCTRL> @gaunterodimmw I don't think Ball needs to be stronger, though. Tanks should be strong, sure, but I'm just saying that Tanks don't seem to dictate the meta nearly as much as DPS and Support. Although OW1.0, Tanks were, like, EVERYTHING in the meta.

[2022-12-21 21:31:52] <+Lightning_Dove> the endorsement system is kinda booty cheeks, i never really worry bout it
[2022-12-21 21:31:55] <BlackTiphoon> High endorsement doesn't even feel rewarding in OW2
[2022-12-21 21:32:02] <barica_obama> Ramatra is so op

[2022-12-21 21:32:10] <%SkitzoCTRL> @BlackTiphoon Yeah, you get like 4k to your battlepass? Uuuh... Nah.
[2022-12-21 21:32:20] <%+SweenBeann> endorsements are so wack in OW2 - who cares about a lil extra battle pass xp every few days
[2022-12-21 21:32:24] <vegito_shadow> @QuincysTavern FRRRRRRRr
[2022-12-21 21:32:31] <%meowmeow800> I miss when they would give you free lootboxes
[2022-12-21 21:32:35] <%SkitzoCTRL> @SweenBeann Isn't it like every two weeks, too?
[2022-12-21 21:32:38] <%flargie> Endorsements def need a better reward than a small amount of xp, there's no incentive atm
[2022-12-21 21:32:44] <%slaum00> man flats you look like you wanna go back to bed my guy
[2022-12-21 21:32:44] <%$Steven_Servo> I guess it help to see if someone is a team player

[2022-12-21 21:32:55] <MimicRaccon821> @MimicRaccon821 no im sense your MMR went down so much your still in blank rank but sense you're now winning your MMR is lower then the rank you are in so would you derank
[2022-12-21 21:32:56] <@%^StreamElements> ha ha hey cutie, why aren't you smiling? you should smile more, show those pearly whites! ah ha what's that? you have a boyfriend? pfft I wasn't flirting with you, that's crazy. just tryna make you smile, queen. maybe you should drop that zero and get this hero since you aren't smiling with him. ah ha ha what that mouth do? smile? cos you should do it
[2022-12-21 21:33:08] <+Papa_John5> Hey Flats who‚Äôs the best healer in your opinion? I can do massive healing as Moira but her Ult ain‚Äôt that great.
[2022-12-21 21:33:13] <%SkitzoCTRL> @flargie Coins! 10 coins per level of endorsement twice a week.
[2022-12-21 21:33:20] <%+Sourdoughjack97> they need to give us back the 50 xp for giving endorsements at least
[2022-12-21 21:33:21] VIEWERS: 1¬†807
[2022-12-21 21:33:24] <%flargie> if they made special cosmetics that were awarded based on endorsment levels, that would proabably entice people to behave lmao
[2022-12-21 21:33:27] <%+SweenBeann> @SkitzoCTRL I have no idea the timeframe but that sounds right
[2022-12-21 21:33:28] <%+MartianMagic> The biggest issue with incentives is you can‚Äôt endorse friends. I play with a 5 stack often, so my endorsement is low as a result. Bad system.
[2022-12-21 21:33:30] <aerogaace> I swear I‚Äôve been on endorsement 4 and 5 just seems impossible
[2022-12-21 21:33:36] <%SirDreamt> @Papa_John5 moira ulkt is fire as long as ur team is in front of u
[2022-12-21 21:33:39] <avengedver1> @meowmeow800 I remember getting my first ever lootbox it had a winton skin

[2022-12-21 21:34:26] <%flargie> @WellbeWelloff it can't last forever, bro
[2022-12-21 21:34:27] <+Papa_John5> Ye, Moira can get some fat heals, sadly most players opt for a more damage based Moira
[2022-12-21 21:34:33] <%NFG_Lucky> Only advantage I can see with the endorsements is your matchmaking. According to OW you will be matched up with higher endorsed players. Which means less toxicity, less leavers, etc.
[2022-12-21 21:34:39] <dat4sqn> I smoke weed to help with my apnea, but if I dont sleep right away i become so paranoid i cant sleep
[2022-12-21 21:34:40] <%unpundun> I was getting very little oxygen before I got my CPAP and was basically a zombie for a year. IDK how I survived let alone made it to work/functioned

[2022-12-21 21:35:06] <%SkitzoCTRL> @NFG_Lucky Is that confirmed that there's a behavior-based matchmaking?

[2022-12-21 21:36:23] <%SkitzoCTRL> Bap is B-tier, Immortality Field is S-Tier, therefore Bap is A-Tier.

[2022-12-21 21:38:00] <%$atsBrew> I would say Ana
[2022-12-21 21:38:01] <%+sypher31> id say ana
[2022-12-21 21:38:02] <+Bold_Star> @flargie i have always used crl for crouch in FPS games
[2022-12-21 21:38:02] <%+JP3REIGNS> Kiriko or ana
[2022-12-21 21:38:03] <%+kazenblade29> Moira lowest skill tier
[2022-12-21 21:38:04] <%flargie> ana is mechanically the toughest imo
[2022-12-21 21:38:07] <%+TheEmptySkys1> Define mechanics. Ana, Lucio, or Kiriko
[2022-12-21 21:38:13] <%meowmeow800> bap with the heal shoot min max

[2022-12-21 21:38:16] <sweatynut4> Zen movement is hard to master
[2022-12-21 21:38:17] <krystalsg> Ana
[2022-12-21 21:38:22] <luyanami> it's bap or kiriko
[2022-12-21 21:38:22] <%+JadinSedai> anna
[2022-12-21 21:38:22] <sirhandog> Been a minute since I‚Äôve watched you flats. Hope you feel better as the day goes on ‚ù§Ô∏è
[2022-12-21 21:38:22] <sypher31> ana can be harder to heal
[2022-12-21 21:38:23] <Stefen__> zen - putting that orb on ppl is hard man
[2022-12-21 21:38:23] <dal908> Yes bap
[2022-12-21 21:38:24] <ChaHaeIn_> ZZen
[2022-12-21 21:38:24] <+Papa_John5> Bap ult sucks when yoiu have Doomfist and Winston as your tanks
[2022-12-21 21:38:26] <kazenblade29> Ana you have to aim
[2022-12-21 21:38:27] <%flargie> @flargie its cool for crouch, but the holding of it makes it kind of weird for me, i hit it with my pinky
[2022-12-21 21:38:27] <%soul_stealer5> ana or bap imo
[2022-12-21 21:38:32] <%+kawaiicaa> I say Ana, Kiriko or Bap
[2022-12-21 21:38:41] <aalzi> obviously its moira
[2022-12-21 21:38:44] <e_m_a_8> Lucio does require mechanics but its a lot easier to wall ride than juggling healing and dmg and cooldowns on Bap and Ana
[2022-12-21 21:38:49] <a_spudulike> before the shift change yeh
[2022-12-21 21:38:53] <%$atsBrew> Mercy is a hit or miss but that's movement alone that needs to be mastered
[2022-12-21 21:38:55] <%+sypher31> bap can escape easier
[2022-12-21 21:38:56] <%flargie> trying to keep the rhythm with bap is tough imo
[2022-12-21 21:38:59] <%+kazenblade29> And do damage
[2022-12-21 21:39:02] <%+Evilbeard> I'm here to watch the Toks get made
[2022-12-21 21:39:08] <SonicWaveGaming1> Exactly Ana and Bap need aim, precision. Kiriko and Lucio are more forgiving
[2022-12-21 21:39:14] <%SkitzoCTRL> Bap>Ana=Zen=Kiriko, IMO for skill requirement.
[2022-12-21 21:39:14] <%+JP3REIGNS> Ana. The sleep is one of the hardest skill shots in the game, that can be game changing
[2022-12-21 21:39:15] <+Papa_John5> Ana, but only no scopes
[2022-12-21 21:39:17] <%+kazenblade29> Bap as more survivabiltiy
[2022-12-21 21:39:19] <%$GhostshipRobot> Ana needs aim on those sleeps.

[2022-12-21 21:39:31] <Downstrait> kiriko dmg feels too random for me classify it as skill intensive as the others
[2022-12-21 21:39:41] <%flargie> but kiriko doesn't need to get headshots to provide value

[2022-12-21 21:39:52] <%+kawaiicaa> Kiriko is tricky with dmg
[2022-12-21 21:39:58] <%flargie> she's still giving value with her insane healing output and mobility and obvi her ult
[2022-12-21 21:40:00] <%TJ_0K> i was outside in the cold and now i can feel my heartbeat in my hands
[2022-12-21 21:40:01] <a_spudulike> she is 70% heals
[2022-12-21 21:40:02] <%SkitzoCTRL> @flargie Healbot Kiriko is actually legitimately the best way to player her.

[2022-12-21 21:40:13] <%+WellbeWelloff> Ana is the best old lady support

[2022-12-21 22:11:42] <%KevinKalani> @kazenblade29 It's not deceptive, it's literally functioning at it is meant to. Flexing means you are willing to play any role. They will prioritize putting you in a role that fills the game first. People don't play support, so thus most games are missing support, meaning when you flex you mostly get support
