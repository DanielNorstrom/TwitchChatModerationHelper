[2023-01-05 01:02:22] <@%^StreamElements> we made fun of that guy but yet here we are still stuck in our trepid conversation about our inner psyche.

[2023-01-05 01:20:46] <%+Kaniela1904> @trey24k you gotta use matching bug on scav

[2023-01-05 01:53:07] <RLKallday> idk but it only matters if the bengals lose
[2023-01-05 01:53:08] <+murkax> are people still mad abt the kappa speed run with 2thy?
[2023-01-05 01:53:08] <+BenJammin_lol> i think they have to play it again eventually so the stakes are the same
[2023-01-05 01:53:08] <%xminard> Theyll probably play it the last week, instead of doing the pro bowl stuff
[2023-01-05 01:53:09] <+intoxicatedgary> GOOO LIONS BABY
[2023-01-05 01:53:10] <!%c10v3rk1n6> Not tryin to be heartless. But it is a business. The show must go on at some point
[2023-01-05 01:53:10] <%jack_beamzz> no way the can just avoid the game
[2023-01-05 01:53:11] <+ItBeHabib_1> @ibdaevilmonkey RIP missing mine by like 1-2 min
[2023-01-05 01:53:12] <wimpie1310> or they were in talks about them doing it as they have a 16 game season
[2023-01-05 01:53:14] <hnc41198> they will prob make it a tie
[2023-01-05 01:53:14] <+Taynk_> they usually have a week before playoffs for any make up games
[2023-01-05 01:53:16] <+deputymorgan> they wont call it a tie
[2023-01-05 01:53:17] <%Thegianthippo4> They should shift the playoffs back one week because of the 2 weeks before the superbowl
[2023-01-05 01:53:18] <RLKallday> if they dont then they dont have to replay
[2023-01-05 01:53:18] <+ObviouslySmurfin> They might extend the NFL a week for that one game due to the circumstances
[2023-01-05 01:53:19] <%$headassyerrr> i heard they will play during nfc wildcard while afc takes a bye and then afc will play wildcard while nfc takes bye

[2023-01-05 01:53:29] <%+justmosey> NFL posted something today, they may push back everything a week and play before playoffs. They may null it like it never happened too
[2023-01-05 01:53:32] <%+pleasebecomp> ravens not gonna win lil bro
[2023-01-05 01:53:32] <+way2faast> drops reset in 7 min right?

[2023-01-05 01:53:38] <+deputymorgan> if you guys win this week i think you will win the division
[2023-01-05 01:53:39] <%+GlizzyAllTheWay> @Trey24k so if they void it like a coivd game, Chiefs would potentially clench, ravens in, bills in, bengals in

[2023-01-05 15:29:27] <3X1L3tv> got 1 tapped by a scav today from over 100m and he had m55a1
[2023-01-05 15:29:42] <+chronic_danger> i like the challenge of the scavs and that they seem to be all different caliber of skill. makes pmcs not be able to just run around the map so freely.
[2023-01-05 15:29:43] <fullmetalp0ny> do scavs have inertia?
[2023-01-05 15:29:46] <%topgun3k99> I thought raiders came when the train came. Is there a different condition that makes them show up?
[2023-01-05 15:29:56] <%Shinyleprechaun> yeah wouldnt surprise me if scavs just didnt really change either LOL

[2023-01-05 15:30:17] <%Geron3> if scavs are like this they better do single player mode
[2023-01-05 15:30:19] <%$30secondmains> @trey24k  do you think they should’ve just not released streets and pushed back wipe another month or something else?

[2023-01-05 15:54:21] <viciousalcoholic> People will justify anything in their brain to rationalize that their own cheating is acceptable
[2023-01-05 15:54:21] <+EchoAngelpaw> whats ur take on cheating for fun in single player games like fallout or whatever it may bed?
[2023-01-05 15:54:21] <+RadiaShane> Unless you are actually fighting wildfires. Lol
[2023-01-05 15:54:21] <island_boy_420> found the cheater
[2023-01-05 15:54:21] <+harrytortilla> a good cheater is a one that doesnt get caught duh

[2023-01-05 15:54:25] <tilo_schwarzbach> @chalky_worktime sounds like u are cheating "to kill other cheater"
[2023-01-05 15:54:26] <+ItZzzTheChair> the people that pay for in game help enable the cheaters
[2023-01-05 15:54:26] <TheRealq1q1> only good hacking is hacker vs hacker in csgo where they have servers for it
[2023-01-05 15:54:30] <%samsquanch_9> @Trey24k, why don't they just check the code to catch the cheaters?? monkaHmm
[2023-01-05 15:54:30] <+WNTRfps> tarkov already gives me pain on its own, i dont need a cheater to do it for me
[2023-01-05 15:54:30] <%+divenavy18> Imagine how many cheaters watch you

[2023-01-05 15:54:30] <+sambrady910> What about people that sell cheats cause that’s what they’re good at?
[2023-01-05 15:54:31] <%DrArcy> It's crazy the real life money market cheating can break you into.  People can actually get paid enough to NOT work by doing cheating.
[2023-01-05 15:54:32] <pupkin011> BSG should fight cheaters but they clearly dont give a shit at all

[2023-01-05 15:56:14] <+RelapsdTV> all these people in your chat defending it are the people trying to convince themselves they are a good cheater

[2023-01-05 15:56:14] <+Antireyfer> @Antireyfer weird that both termes exist then :O

[2023-01-05 15:56:17] <+harrytortilla> nah we should all stop playing tarkov til they fix the anti cheat
[2023-01-05 15:56:17] <%Shinyleprechaun> for the record i doubt people hack to kill hackers, i was just wondering if anyone knew if that existed
[2023-01-05 15:56:17] <SlowChief> @Trey24k evading battle eye bans is super easy
[2023-01-05 15:56:18] <%RolledByRobbe> well no and yes
[2023-01-05 15:56:18] <%NineFour0ne> that doesnt punish actual cheaters tbh
[2023-01-05 15:56:19] <%thelynnman> that makes sense but would hurt sales and thats the main goal, not our enjoyment
[2023-01-05 15:56:20] <%RapidlyAgingOldFart> people say spoofing hardware bans is easy tho
[2023-01-05 15:56:20] <JPsour> i think thats how it works on tarkov isnt it
[2023-01-05 15:56:20] <phinvincible> OK but it feels like BE is part of the problem at this point
[2023-01-05 15:56:20] <MrFlubss> Like Vac bans?
[2023-01-05 15:56:23] <J0rdan_p> i level hacked on cod like 10 years ago, should i be hardware banned everywhere? Sadge
[2023-01-05 15:56:24] <%$NadeSpamSam> @olliety1 it can be bypassed so easily
[2023-01-05 15:56:24] <%+barbucha_god> yo, that's an idea!
[2023-01-05 15:56:25] <%dbKYOTO> @Trey24k server i play squad on auto bans people for having a vac ban on their account etc
[2023-01-05 15:56:25] <%$inswizzy> @syntheticnull there’s no drops on this stream
[2023-01-05 15:56:27] <%NineFour0ne> mist cheaters are so good at evading
[2023-01-05 15:56:28] <%RolledByRobbe> only when its like pure cheating, not when its specific exploiting for a game
[2023-01-05 15:56:28] <+Tiny_Dancer187> some people only have an hour or two to play games a week, so when they finally hop on and get wrecked by a cheater, it is infuriating.
[2023-01-05 15:56:28] <Leonntech> do you think BSG is doing enough to stop cheaters? why not direct hardware bans?
[2023-01-05 15:56:32] <locomatador87> can't do that because hardware can be virtualized
[2023-01-05 15:56:32] <jetskins> they dont do that because of money :D
[2023-01-05 15:56:32] <+EchoAngelpaw> but arnt there false positives like LVNDMARK once?
[2023-01-05 15:56:33] <+dougjstone34> Tarkov is a great game, but it has some serious problems. Cheaters is one

[2023-01-05 15:56:34] <%+iiRid> They make too much off the new accounts so
[2023-01-05 15:56:35] <+Synthrix> its not implemented cus they wouldnt make as much money
[2023-01-05 15:56:38] <ggwp123ttv> but how are you gonna connect accounts via battleye ?
[2023-01-05 15:56:38] <%+FilthyShot> @Trey24k  they should just put all the cheaters in their own servers without telling them and let them
[2023-01-05 15:56:39] <%+IIZabuza> 99% of R6 players would be banned on everything LUL
[2023-01-05 15:56:39] <+JesseFX21> What is that handgaurd?
[2023-01-05 15:56:40] <pupkin011> Yeah BE is part of the problem, as well as BSG
[2023-01-05 15:56:43] <%GamerGareb> that’s what some games do with VAC it won’t let you play online
[2023-01-05 15:56:43] <!%+ChiliPoPhili> im not surprised cause they wouldnt make as much money KEKW
[2023-01-05 15:56:44] <%+StvnStan> we talked to a cheater before and he said he just enjoys making people mad
[2023-01-05 15:56:45] <%+xp00pstain25x> It’s because these company’s make money off cheating
[2023-01-05 15:56:46] <%+xTeebZx> "im one of the good ones, like robin hood"
[2023-01-05 15:56:46] <%RapidlyAgingOldFart> it's easy to spoof

[2023-01-05 15:56:48] <%may__bee_> i think the amount of people defending it shows just how many are cheating
[2023-01-05 15:56:48] <kurtjen> isnt spoofing a thing
[2023-01-05 15:56:48] <pupkin011> There are HWID bans
[2023-01-05 15:56:50] <phinvincible> so they can sell more standard accounts duh KEKW

[2023-01-05 15:56:54] <%NineFour0ne> u can avoid hardware bans easy
[2023-01-05 15:56:54] <Ribitx> tarkov does hwid bans
[2023-01-05 15:56:54] <SlowChief> @Trey24k We do have hardware bans. But there are MANY ways around it
[2023-01-05 15:56:55] <DarkRadeon7000> getting around a Battleye ban is not difficult with Raid 0 drive causing hardware ID of null
[2023-01-05 15:56:56] <kingmidas173> I think the main thing that drives people to cheat is alo the time it takes to grind everything in this game
[2023-01-05 15:56:56] <%+Pepe_Enjoyer> It is very easy to get around a HWID ban

[2023-01-05 15:57:10] <ichgehnichtrau> hw bans can still be evaded tho
[2023-01-05 15:57:10] <SwagPumpkinn> they should just make it a criminal offence like a month in prison or something cause then no one would really risk it for prison time
[2023-01-05 15:57:11] <%Shinyleprechaun> theres always a way around it
[2023-01-05 15:57:13] <%samsquanch_9> what is that talking?
[2023-01-05 15:57:13] <%Sebbyz> Spoofing is a thing yes
[2023-01-05 15:57:14] <pupkin011> Yeah, EAC has way stricter HWID bans tho
[2023-01-05 15:57:15] <kr0ghCS> Very easy to spoof
[2023-01-05 15:57:16] <%$thot_rocket> @CardiacArrest__ well they have server bans and account bans, so if you get banned on enough servers, then theyll fully ban the account.
[2023-01-05 15:57:17] <ggwp123ttv> there is software called hwid spoofer
[2023-01-05 15:57:17] <%Shinyleprechaun> as long as they make money, itll be around
[2023-01-05 15:57:18] <tilo_schwarzbach> u cant do anything against hwid spoofing is the problem
[2023-01-05 15:57:19] <%thecoldesthour> i be cheating on bloons tower defense. im sorry trey
[2023-01-05 15:57:19] <%+Zeulius> For every game that has battle eye if you get banned for cheating you should be just put in cheat lobby if you get banned or some shit
[2023-01-05 15:57:19] <BIueTTV> why spoof if you just dont get banned?
[2023-01-05 15:57:22] <JPsour> mhmm it makes sense
[2023-01-05 15:57:23] <+juummppp> Should do like call of duty instead of banning them only put them in lobbys with other cheaters
[2023-01-05 15:57:24] <%$olliety1> @JesseFX21 Its a Troy PRI
[2023-01-05 15:57:26] <lunchness> That’s the biggest problem

[2023-01-05 15:57:31] <Lupofin> there will always be ways to go around anticheats or hardware bans, its about making the leven o f entry harer
[2023-01-05 15:57:31] <SlowChief> not only spoofers, you just change your hard-drive configs and it works again.

[2023-01-05 15:57:33] <%$NadeSpamSam> Who was cheating @Trey24k ?
[2023-01-05 15:57:33] <%olimon_gaming> they should do MAC ban somehow
[2023-01-05 15:57:34] <%+iiRid> Need an anti cheat like valorant
[2023-01-05 15:57:35] <%+thiccroi> I’m sure it would still have an impact tho
[2023-01-05 15:57:37] <$azolaki> cheat providers offer spoofing software as well
[2023-01-05 15:57:38] <casuall_op> theres programs that just switch your hardware id's
[2023-01-05 15:57:39] <Dorta> The cheater situation is kinda weird with BSG, regarding the money they make with them buying new accs sadly
[2023-01-05 15:57:40] <jannikrf> and they dont always hwid ban first time ban either its so fucking weird
[2023-01-05 15:57:40] <%CardiacArrest__> BSG makes too much money off cheaters is the issue lol
[2023-01-05 15:57:45] <!%+ChiliPoPhili> downloading cheats is very sus cause you have to disable your firewall
[2023-01-05 15:57:47] <+cryptotheturtle> do you think bsg isnt harder on cheaters because they make money off the amount of accounts they make
[2023-01-05 15:57:50] <%samsquanch_9> that is so fucking dumb
[2023-01-05 15:57:51] <19number1> it's counter intuitive if anything
[2023-01-05 15:57:53] <phinvincible> yeah, thats not an accident either, BSG knows what they are doing
[2023-01-05 15:57:53] <%DrArcy> It's a lose-lose game trying to stop cheating.  Every time you find a way to stop them, they'll find another way around it.  It's like hacking PC's, there's always trying attempts to break things.
[2023-01-05 15:57:55] <%olimon_gaming> hey man those are paying customers, mkay
[2023-01-05 15:57:55] <%Shinyleprechaun> yeah thats so whack bro lol
[2023-01-05 15:57:55] <%+barbucha_god> reserve alarm broke as well?
[2023-01-05 15:57:56] <%$SwissSteveW> true
[2023-01-05 15:57:57] <%+Pepe_Enjoyer> Idk why they would do that
[2023-01-05 15:57:57] <%samsquanch_9> why would people buy multiple copies?
[2023-01-05 15:57:57] <Leonntech> also there are radars that work via virtual computers  which are absolutely undetectable due to how they work.
[2023-01-05 15:57:57] <chalky_worktime> Thats silly
[2023-01-05 15:57:59] <%$inswizzy> Why is that a thing
[2023-01-05 15:58:00] <TheRealq1q1> fresh accs cost $8 on some sites lol
[2023-01-05 15:58:03] <%+Megidus_> It's helping BSG's bank account and hurting the game and they absolutely know it
[2023-01-05 15:58:05] <$azolaki> I wanna know what that conversation is about tbh
[2023-01-05 15:58:07] <Ribitx> farm hackers
[2023-01-05 15:58:08] <SlowChief> @ChiliPoPhili what lol
[2023-01-05 15:58:12] <R3KK> Dude BSG loves cheaters... They make so much money from it
[2023-01-05 15:58:12] <phinvincible> they know exactly why they do it LUL they know who buys those too
[2023-01-05 15:58:12] <fromthekron> its because they dont want cheaters out of the game
[2023-01-05 15:58:12] <Ribitx> free money glitch
[2023-01-05 15:58:12] <+p0nchyytv> wassup shitter
[2023-01-05 15:58:13] <looslin> still doesnt matter when you can buy russian accs
[2023-01-05 15:58:13] <%mochasoda> reserve alarm?  modCheck
[2023-01-05 15:58:14] <%+drewzifaust> BSG is the cheaters prolly. Only makes sense how much they can make of RMT
[2023-01-05 15:58:15] <fromthekron> they just want them to not be bad
[2023-01-05 15:58:15] <JPsour> oh most def , they can make that money back easy asf
[2023-01-05 15:58:16] <%TvNefarious> more money!
[2023-01-05 15:58:17] <+sambrady910> It’s called greed.
[2023-01-05 15:58:19] <%+StvnStan> they like cheaters makes them mondy
[2023-01-05 15:58:20] <%+ryan231d> @Trey24k  people defending cheaters are on straight copium
[2023-01-05 15:58:21] <+illojuanerreprimido> Good thing about cheaters for bsg is that they buy the game multiple times, same thing happened to csgo before it was free
[2023-01-05 15:58:21] <+EchoAngelpaw> tbh I'm not upset the alarm is broken :)
[2023-01-05 15:58:22] <%+StvnStan> money

[2023-01-05 15:59:04] <%CardiacArrest__> The amount that cheaters spend is fucking insane though lol. You have to buy the cheats, a HWID spoofer, new account when you’re banned

[2023-01-05 16:22:35] <@%^StreamElements> the stupidest thing about it is if they really wanted to ban cheaters it would be easy all they gotta look for is codes that have been changed if u know coding u understand what i mean its not hard to find out when someone changes the codes the only reason they don’t is cuz the money the cheaters bring its facts technically they could make a dummy server and anyone with changed codes aka cheaters could be singled out and always sent to a dummy server

[2023-01-05 17:33:16] <+ForeignVapes> If your in a home defense situation, your gonna want all your neighbors to know your in a gunfight. Thats why I saw no suppressor for home defense.
[2023-01-05 17:33:20] <+DaBearGaming> but worse
[2023-01-05 17:33:21] <+hirtchu> i wont mention how but a 30-30  got fired in my front room - when i was about 16 it was so loud my ears were ringing for hours

[2023-01-05 17:36:21] <%+21foxhound> That’s nuts, I thought it was a 10 day wait for all items
[2023-01-05 17:36:25] <%SteremyJeele> It's in their best interest to make it take as long as possible.
[2023-01-05 17:36:26] <MrSingleLikeaPringle> yeah like

[2023-01-05 17:37:08] <$onepunchmango_> @old_gweg Bro I could say the same shit about you being unreasonably conservative and you'd have the same reaction. Both side are snowflakes
[2023-01-05 17:37:11] <%madmanritz95> ya but 10 days in cali, even if you already have guns makes no sense
[2023-01-05 17:37:12] <+scherbe88> @king_kob_the_corn_king i live in Germany, feels safe at home and in cities. Nobody is getting shot here at least…

[2023-01-05 17:37:47] <%+killabeezey2> They gotta justify their salaries at ATF
[2023-01-05 17:37:48] <%Tonylieh10> They delay it so they throw off your plans for a assassination attempt cause of course that’s the only reason they believe people buy supressor for
[2023-01-05 17:37:48] <%+derrtynater> how many rounds should a suppressor last? or does that depend on the ammo
[2023-01-05 17:37:51] <Tyrosus> @PDRQ yeesh

[2023-01-05 17:38:11] <AidanBk> unless you cook your suppressor lol
[2023-01-05 17:38:11] <%madmanritz95> depends on the design of the supressor
[2023-01-05 17:38:12] <$PDRQ> ye i use the club guns and just buy rounds, but everything is stored there

[2023-01-05 17:38:19] <+Arkhan__> You can own them but have to keep them at designated locations
[2023-01-05 17:38:24] <!%ethan8855> @Trey24k  Every firearm manufactured in the country has to be documented to the ATF, majority of the transactions are coming from manufacturers and that's what starts clogging the system
[2023-01-05 17:38:24] <%+dieselnj217> I went for my firearm license and they just said nah fam you straight lmao 🤣

[2023-01-05 18:06:54] <%madmanritz95> 10mm better than any other pistol cartridge tho
[2023-01-05 18:06:54] <Faraksiss> Need a lucky shot with 10mm
[2023-01-05 18:06:54] <%ColeChiIls> @LegaliseCheese Its probably comparable to 9x21 in EFT so weak still

[2023-01-05 18:48:28] <%+BeardedTortle> @Trey24k, Texas appears to be an exception, allowing use of deadly force when there's no other way to protect or recapture property even in situations involving simple theft or criminal mischief, though only at night, Tex. Penal Code § 9.42; see, e.g., McFadden v. State (Tex. Ct. App. 2018).)

[2023-01-05 18:49:51] <%$DoktorFritz> Cheer100 the only non-lethal shot is a cum shot, learn to splooge in the face of danger and you will be invincible. the only month i have to conceal carry is november (for obvious reasons). but every other month if some dude wants to take my wallet he's gonna take my seed too. and if he still doesnt buggar off i will threaten to jerk him off too. that's call a chicago reload, when you're lil peeter pumpkin eater is all out of the juice, you use their ammunition against them.

[2023-01-05 19:08:17] <+SpuddyA7X> Shots 1-5: Clearly missed. Shots 6-9: Missed due to recoil (bad spray control). Shots 10-11: Very close, but recoil and inaccuracy make these reasonable misses. Shot 12: Likely didn't actually fire because you were already dead.

[2023-01-05 19:14:24] <%SeizeSir> The phrase “it’s just a game” is such a weak mindset. You are ok with what happened, losing, imperfection of a craft. When you stop getting angry after losing, you’ve lost twice.   There’s always something to learn, and always room for improvement, never settle.

Typically, in fora such as this, I am met with ad-hominem mudslinging, anything from “You racist creep” or “Is that your real voice?” to raucous schoolyard laughter and threats of the dreaded “toilet swirly.” However, your willingness to engage with me over the phone on the subject of pizza shows an intellectual fortitude and openness to dangerous ideas which reflects highly on your character.

No, not Suge Knight, I think he's locked up in prison. I'm talkin' shungite. Anyways, it's a two billion year-old like, rock stone that protects against frequencies and unwanted frequencies that may be traveling in the air. That's my story, I bought a whole bunch of stuff.

[2023-01-05 19:59:25] <$SirPanny> Cheer100 The missile knows where it is at all times. It knows this because it knows where it isn't. By subtracting where it is from where it isn't, or where it isn't from where it is (whichever is greater), it obtains a difference, or deviation. The guidance subsystem uses deviations to generate corrective commands to drive the missile from a position where it is to a position where it isn't, and arriving at a position where it wasn't, it now is.

[2023-01-05 20:16:03] <%+lorde15146> That happened to my buddy in high school wrestling. I carried him off the mat when complaining of chest pain and then he started convulsing shortly after. Had to be brought back a couple times. Our senior year at state. He ended up making a full recovery and didnt remember anything in the last 3 weeks.

[2023-01-05 20:16:37] <Flanker> did they fix that scope yet
[2023-01-05 20:16:40] <%$FriedSliceTX> Skip forgot that this is real liife for a sec
[2023-01-05 20:16:55] <%SteremyJeele> Yeah I'm pretty sure he was trying to say that the decision seems so irrelevant in the moment, when watching a player be revived on the field. But he worded it like dogshit, and lacked awareness.
[2023-01-05 20:16:55] <Zeloo> @Flanker yea
[2023-01-05 20:16:55] <%CardiacArrest__> Skip was shitty on Luke after his historic game saying “Well he isn’t Giannis”

[2023-01-05 20:17:20] <+ClawsV> im pretty sure he was just backtracking from the first tweet
[2023-01-05 20:17:23] <+cerret07> his original tweet sounded like the opposite of that one

[2023-01-05 22:22:57] <Christophersen> the televised cases arent regular court though, it's arbitration
[2023-01-05 22:22:58] <bubble_d> they just agree to arbitrate the trail and wave some rights prior to the show
[2023-01-05 22:22:59] <+nu33ets> she is a retired judge and retired before airing her show. So during the show, no she was not a current, real judge
[2023-01-05 22:23:02] <plaugeofenrique> one of the highest paid too look at her salary

[2023-01-05 23:01:52] <%ColonelxHatred> window provides more protection than a full length glass door
[2023-01-05 23:01:53] <ItsPun1sh> Do you think dorms marked is worth?
[2023-01-05 23:01:54] <%+TurbanGerbil> Neg, the door might be setup with some type of trip wire on entry
[2023-01-05 23:02:01] <+MrBubz612> i found him this am fml lol
[2023-01-05 23:02:05] <+geekpuncherttv> Aren’t going in there just want to get less lethal off, and maybe a gas grenade?
[2023-01-05 23:02:07] <%+MrStrothmann> i would think bosses show up less at night
[2023-01-05 23:02:09] <ikilledhomerrr> break the glass and open the door OMEGALUL

[2023-01-05 23:02:11] <+Taynk_> for real tho the door is too exposed by using the window they have cover to use a non lethal rounds and what not
[2023-01-05 23:02:11] <snipery3tti> most agencies wont enter anymore unless they have to they just gas people out
[2023-01-05 23:02:14] <%coffeebean90201> it's him

[2023-01-05 23:04:58] <%OFPBlue_Falcon> All mark rooms should be worth and having some decent in them. But SCAVs should also always spawn around the rooms to prevent chads from sprinting in and out with the goods
