[2022-12-28 00:25:46] <@%^StreamElements> When Flats was in high school he joined the football team. Within his first week there, someone else on the team ended up crossing a line and pissing Flats off. Flats flattened the kid with his 6ft body, thus earning him the nickname "Flats" since "Flatten" sounds stupid.

[2022-12-28 00:26:21] <lautymanword> @raptorgod_ thanks for the tips. btw, when do you think it's better to pick Zen, bap or kiriko? (in what situations I mean, because I think that I could make better choices with the supports)

[2022-12-28 00:26:40] <bright_geist> zen is probably my fav hero but he has no mobility and his heals are weak. the dps output doesnt match moiras either.

[2022-12-28 00:27:59] <bright_geist> @weboremerald because for him to match moira he needs self sustain, which moira has in spades: she can wisp away, and top herself off with heal orb. zen is a sitting duck.

[2022-12-28 00:29:51] <%AnAbsoluteUnlt> @lautymanword I mean it also depends on your rank i guess, as it gets higher, people will be playing more into the meta, meaning that zen would be considered a throw pick, hes even considered a throw pick in plat, etc.

[2022-12-28 00:41:22] <%+BubbaDaBuddha> @bright_geist best case scenario, your tanks move up past it and take space cause you can double heal them while doing many dps

[2022-12-28 01:17:14] <%its_mrriceguy> French toast: egg, vanilla, cinnamon, and a touch of milk. Add butter and syrup after. No "sugar" is needed
[2022-12-28 01:17:14] <drewsin> flats you should try freanch toast with pepper jack chesse, ham and a fryed egg as a sandwich and use syrup as a dipper
[2022-12-28 01:17:15] <squirrelxxxnuts> Bro I’m a chef so you gotta trust. French toast is made with eggs cream and vanilla extract and a bit of powdered sugar as a dredge. Then cooked in a pan. Sweetness from vanilla and sugar
[2022-12-28 01:17:15] <%quickburn619> Powdered sugar/syrup are toppings added AFTER the cooking... It ain't the bread or the eggs.

[2022-12-28 01:18:00] <aguilaryy> Flats is right that white bread is gonna give you sweetness. So just white bread and egg is gonna give you the standard french toast. You can add salt or sugar to the egg mixture and it's gonna be more savoury or more sweet. Reuben going crazy about how white bread can't give you sweetness but it does my dude.

[2022-12-28 03:51:51] <@%^StreamElements> When Flats was in high school he joined the football team. Within his first week there, someone else on the team ended up crossing a line and pissing Flats off. Flats flattened the kid with his 6ft body, thus earning him the nickname "Flats" since "Flatten" sounds stupid.

[2022-12-28 05:21:06] <wild4told> Flats , i recently saw your tiktok react video on yt and i had a reaction to your comment on the “2cp is better than push” topic. i wanted to comment on this but i was not watching the stream. i belive 2cp is better than push BUT only bc of the amount of maps. i personaly only enjoy esperanca and queen street has its moments, but i absolutly hate colosseo. so i only like 1 of 3 maps in an entire game mode, i think that is bad. i also feel that this will be the way for a while with blizz saying

[2022-12-28 05:45:44] <@%^StreamElements> When Flats was in high school he joined the football team. Within his first week there, someone else on the team ended up crossing a line and pissing Flats off. Flats flattened the kid with his 6ft body, thus earning him the nickname "Flats" since "Flatten" sounds stupid.

[2022-12-28 08:55:32] <@%flyingfish1230> no more double coverage
[2022-12-28 08:55:38] <@%flyingfish1230> yeah mine is very good
[2022-12-28 08:55:45] <@%AwCrap> Wait you can have double coverage? Wtf
[2022-12-28 08:56:19] <@%AwCrap> We get it modest you lost your parents' insurance like 40 years ago
[2022-12-28 08:56:28] <@%flyingfish1230> yeah but like only if you have parental coverage and private work coverage for it, thats like theonly way it works i think lul
[2022-12-28 08:56:50] <@%flyingfish1230> although, spousal coverage might give you double?
[2022-12-28 08:56:52] <@%flyingfish1230> idk

[2022-12-28 13:55:12] <@%^StreamElements> When Flats was in high school he joined the football team. Within his first week there, someone else on the team ended up crossing a line and pissing Flats off. Flats flattened the kid with his 6ft body, thus earning him the nickname "Flats" since "Flatten" sounds stupid.

[2022-12-28 19:13:07] <@%^StreamElements> When Flats was in high school he joined the football team. Within his first week there, someone else on the team ended up crossing a line and pissing Flats off. Flats flattened the kid with his 6ft body, thus earning him the nickname "Flats" since "Flatten" sounds stupid.

[2022-12-28 19:39:47] <+ReanuuKeeves> yikes they have reticle bloom on
[2022-12-28 19:39:48] <%original_glm> this happens though like alot
[2022-12-28 19:39:49] <+614Roses> I am sorry I don't have eyes in the back of my head

[2022-12-28 19:39:51] <%bappoclapper> what else can he really do tbh no man’s land is out there

[2022-12-28 19:39:53] <%chisycroissant> When my dps does that to me, I ignore them idgaf
[2022-12-28 19:39:54] <%un_liv4ly> he could have just gone to spawn to heal
[2022-12-28 19:39:55] <%+lazorbheemz> they are all at spawn?!
[2022-12-28 19:39:56] <%bananabonesss> i mean theyre close to spawn soo
[2022-12-28 19:39:57] <%ReebenHauser> not a good situation
[2022-12-28 19:39:57] <%Raptorgod_> @Violet_Ashes are dps were good that game are tank was bad though
[2022-12-28 19:39:58] <marstr1be> sometimes you just cant heal because the front needs to keep tank 100
[2022-12-28 19:39:58] <%$pitch_black03> hmmm looks like the moria was dead so mercy was trying to keep the tank alive while you are in a safe position
[2022-12-28 19:40:02] <redbeanbunplays> as a support this pisses me off

[2022-12-28 19:48:35] <@%^StreamElements> When Flats was in high school he joined the football team. Within his first week there, someone else on the team ended up crossing a line and pissing Flats off. Flats flattened the kid with his 6ft body, thus earning him the nickname "Flats" since "Flatten" sounds stupid.

[2022-12-28 20:08:50] <%xSeveredSaintx> they should turn him into a big bouncy ball tank
[2022-12-28 20:08:50] <%hammydude2001> if he can still pull someone in and do a lot of damage it just makes it where teammates have to help secure a kill

[2022-12-28 20:28:18] <%+Nayyvos> crouch with mouse buttun
[2022-12-28 20:28:19] <%+ESCAY3> you want shift and control because they're bigger keys and easier to hit

[2022-12-28 20:29:32] <%SkitzoCTRL> @Edatox_Sarenu How... Why do you need to bend your pinky for Shift? Your pinky still naturally rests on shift when you are at Home or WASD.
[2022-12-28 20:29:33] <biostrings> I put the f key in the w-key spot, i'll see how it works
[2022-12-28 20:29:33] <%thevoluptuousvelvetfish> Yall still use keyboards? Dont you have a mouse with 104 mouse buttons?

[2022-12-28 20:58:57] <%art3mis_013> Sooo nerf genji ez
[2022-12-28 20:58:57] <scriptedbd> i literally feel like im turning to dust when im a tank with an orb on me

[2022-12-28 20:59:00] <%xShroomies> it should be more like a hunters mark where its up for a few seconds at the very least

[2022-12-28 20:59:02] <+asthelegendgoes> zen discord orb requires skill and team coordination

[2022-12-28 20:59:14] <%+ESCAY3> zen is too easy to kill and that's the trade off
[2022-12-28 20:59:16] <pitym120> BrainSlug
[2022-12-28 20:59:17] <%+PineappleJellie> maybe discord djoesnt dmg tanks as much?
[2022-12-28 20:59:20] <+Dexiray> i guess that all culminates to one simple solution really: Delete Genji
[2022-12-28 20:59:22] <rgb_blanket> If discord gets nerfed then harmony should heal 60 per second
[2022-12-28 20:59:23] <%SpaceCircus_> not many people pick zen despite how strong discord is but people in certain ELOs do not focus the purple ball
[2022-12-28 20:59:24] <MoJiggyGG> Nerf zen n make potheads angry😂
[2022-12-28 20:59:25] <%$alenaistyping> mercy and zen is not under so many eyes being weirdly looked at

[2022-12-28 21:00:21] <x_gingerale_x> It would be really cool if Discord Orb was put on a teammate and gave a weaker damage buff. One Orb per person
[2022-12-28 21:00:25] <matomatical> 25% i think

[2022-12-28 21:00:39] <Oneminuterice> damage amp for1 person vs 5 person damage amp if discoreded
[2022-12-28 21:00:40] <ilovehotmoms58> when they play zen I just pick widow and get east headshots. Benefits of being in silver 3

[2022-12-28 21:00:51] <%0fficer_toaster> @Flats looking on the offical overwatch wiki - Its 25% extra damage
[2022-12-28 21:00:51] <+igoodvibe> and zen still have the orb
[2022-12-28 21:00:51] <Umbra_Skull> and you cant boost and heal as mercy, zen can do both at the same time
[2022-12-28 21:00:52] <koda_kittie> the horror music in this vid kinda makes me laugh

[2022-12-28 21:01:12] <SirBan67> What do you give or change about Zen if youre nuking Discord
[2022-12-28 21:01:13] <%+Hakuna_Mufasa> and mercy is only giving one person 30% damage. if youre zen orbed EVERYONE gets 25% damage on you

[2022-12-28 21:02:35] <%$jasonwocky> Zen is good against Hog but only because Zen is good against every Tank
[2022-12-28 21:02:35] <matomatical> @epic12882 zen is quite good vs hog, but generally ana with sleep/anti is better at least before Kiriko was added
[2022-12-28 21:02:36] <Luzarrow> And zen can play from farther away so hog won’t hook you as often

[2022-12-28 21:02:50] <$PixelLogic_> I mean, zen does have counters tbf. He's right, but he does have a lot of reasons you wouldn't pick him etc.

[2022-12-28 21:05:57] <%$jasonwocky> I just don't see how you do anything meaningful to Discord. Nothing's going to change the fact that 95% of the time it does on the enemy tank. There's still no thought involved whether you add a cooldown or whatever
[2022-12-28 21:05:59] <scriptedbd> noooooo
[2022-12-28 21:05:59] <%KittyQuirky> that keybind clip is onto something btw, historically the up/down/left/right arrows were used in old games in the 90s, moved to WSAD only because it was the more natural left-hand position, furthest to the left

[2022-12-28 21:06:20] <bortisgreatness> worst part about these uninforming tiktoks is that new players see them and assume theyre right because they dont know any better
[2022-12-28 21:06:21] <%+sad_tropix> Weren't you doing something with KarQ's stream?
[2022-12-28 21:06:22] <Zelltribal> Roadhog rework: Give hook a "windup" phase where he can pocked it. While he's winding his movement speed is reduced (or stationary). The longer he charges the further the hook goes. Max charge is like as far as normal hook, no charge hook is like as close as Winston's primary fire. Very similar to Donkey Kongs punch in Super Smash bros.

[2022-12-28 21:06:58] <%+synthed_> As a Zen main fully agree he needs some type of change now with only 1 tank
[2022-12-28 21:06:58] <+truthseekers97> As a zen main, I agree with the zen take
[2022-12-28 21:06:59] <muget5u178> maybe forcing zen to chose between either orbs would be a good start? as well as cooldown
[2022-12-28 21:06:59] <%+PineappleJellie> switch it up, hog gets discord and zen has a hook

[2022-12-28 21:07:15] <%+Sakano_Uzuki> Zen is a problem. Maybe if there was a limit to how long discord stayed on a target and then had a cooldown before you could put it back on

[2022-12-28 21:10:27] <DecayedWanderer> The weapon charms should be acquired through challenges   since they aren't that big a part of  the game and it would be a fun thing to do on the side. Thoughts??? @Flats

Within his first week there, someone else on the team ended up crossing a line and pissing Flats off. Flats flattened the kid with his 6ft body, thus earning him the nickname "Flats" since "Flatten" sounds stupid.

[2022-12-28 21:13:55] <@%^StreamElements> When Flats was in high school he joined the football team. Within his first week there, someone else on the team ended up crossing a line and pissing Flats off. Flats flattened the kid with his 6ft body, thus earning him the nickname "Flats" since "Flatten" sounds stupid.

[2022-12-28 21:13:59] <%BorkBorf> @Flats What about instead of bonus dmg, shooting an orbed target generated self-heal for the hero that shot? It would encourage focus fire in the same way discord did

[2022-12-28 21:58:49] <@%^StreamElements> When Flats was in high school he joined the football team. Within his first week there, someone else on the team ended up crossing a line and pissing Flats off. Flats flattened the kid with his 6ft body, thus earning him the nickname "Flats" since "Flatten" sounds stupid.

Chain Hook: -Damage decreased to 12. -Range decreased to 12 meters. -Cooldown decreased to 6 seconds. NEW PASSIVE: Hamstring -Every 12 seconds, Roadhog's next melee attack is improved to apply Crippled to the target. Crippled enemies dash.

[2022-12-28 22:40:13] <UNCLE__MUSCLE> I'm a really good Overwatch player but the enemy Sojourn is just better. I hit all my heals, perfectly manage my abilities, and my ults are immaculate. If I had any interest in it, I could have gone pro. But I gotta tip my hat to the enemy Sojourn as she shifts up and 1-taps me across the map. "That was a nice shot" I say, as I walk back from spawn.
