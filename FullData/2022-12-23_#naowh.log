[2022-12-23 16:48:59] <+Syrulol> @monty2186 There's a lot of shit in this fight that windmill dunks Prot War if you're not paying attention.
[2022-12-23 16:49:24] <+Syrulol> Monk probably deals with it a bit better than Prot War on this specific encounter tbh.
[2022-12-23 16:49:28] <%+Zaikh> worse for magical damage is defo bear druid, they get shredded
[2022-12-23 16:49:43] <monty2186> I always thought war was the worst

[2022-12-23 17:08:02] <+Krumplord> they woulda been 8% this run if they did a better p2
[2022-12-23 17:08:18] <%+RestorationShaman> its all damage squeeze at this point

[2022-12-23 17:09:32] <%kozoiy> @gamesoar_ or more hps

[2022-12-23 17:10:48] <%+gamesoar_> @kozoiy i think more HPS, unless brought by additional Drops is not possible, they wohnt go down to three healers
[2022-12-23 17:11:09] VIEWERS: 4¬†165
[2022-12-23 17:11:17] <salafull> if they found a way to 3heal it would be more than enought to kill it
[2022-12-23 17:11:18] <%+RestorationShaman> some spicy resto boomkin hybrid
[2022-12-23 17:11:25] <%+pepewrp> but it is as they have said, after the last phase they left it at 39% and it appeared later at 40%. I think that's invariable, but I'm not sure either
[2022-12-23 17:11:37] <tiltcs> salafull not at this ilvl i dont think its possible

[2022-12-23 17:12:31] <salafull> @tiltcs 8% is like 45mi health, an dps does like 65k more dps than a healer
[2022-12-23 17:12:40] <salafull> it would be more than enough im pretty sure
[2022-12-23 17:12:45] <%+gamesoar_> @tiltcs same here, maybe another boss, but not this
[2022-12-23 17:12:58] <tiltcs> im on about hps salafull

[2022-12-23 17:14:26] <%+RestorationShaman> the likelihood of blizzard doing a 5% hp nerf this afternoon is pretty high
[2022-12-23 17:14:34] <%+gamesoar_> @salafull yeah, but you have to keep the raid alive with one less healer, plus the phases are governed vy vault integrity, not Life lost
[2022-12-23 17:14:50] <+ceddybearr> blizz missed the mark on this one lol
[2022-12-23 17:15:01] <tiltcs> salafull honestly they might only kill it on a nerf
[2022-12-23 17:15:08] <Emm_Zee> :tf:

[2022-12-23 17:15:32] <tiltcs> gamesoar_ theres some TASTY raidwides going on that theyre just about pulling through with 4 let alone 3 yeah haha
[2022-12-23 17:15:40] <%+peshack> At least 50 dkp maybe more
[2022-12-23 17:16:04] <%+gamesoar_> @ceddybearr its just that easy to balance a boss for an event Like this chevel3Tune
[2022-12-23 17:16:22] <Emm_Zee> Druids OP? He's doing 25x more damage than anyone else
[2022-12-23 17:16:25] <%+peshack> You all think both liquid and echo kill today?
[2022-12-23 17:16:40] <salafull> @gamesoar_ yeah, if they go down to 3heal then hps is the matter, maybe take an class that have good selfheal and a good utility cds like and dk or an boomy?
[2022-12-23 17:16:51] <ScoobieRoo> dh???
[2022-12-23 17:16:52] <%+Lisim> @peshack if so it will be a nailbiter but i think a bit more dps is needed

[2022-12-23 17:17:56] <tiltcs> nothing announced tho i think
[2022-12-23 17:18:02] <%+Lisim> @tiltcs i mean they did do a 50% nerf...
[2022-12-23 17:18:09] <Emm_Zee> If they 3heal it becomes kinda weird in first intermission no?
[2022-12-23 17:18:21] <%+peshack> Like an hour ago was best pull

[2022-12-23 17:19:01] <%+pepewrp> I thought lowering it below 10% might drop it, like other bosses in mythic, especially due to the crazy dps the last phase requires. I was wrong

[2022-12-23 18:56:16] <%+Ayasira> I mean, boss was 5% with all 20 alive and 4 rez available, I think that was a kill even without the nerf
[2022-12-23 18:56:17] <%Moanion> would've been insane to have the nerf post wake up

[2022-12-23 18:56:23] <%+rias_____gremory> per maxs chat Max legit put the hotfix in chat himself - Slightly adjusted the timing of events at the start of phase 3. -Reduced the rate at which motes of Storm-Energy are spawned. -Slowed the rate that the Raging Storm closes in

[2022-12-23 18:56:28] <%+Lisim> yea roles reveresed it still suck! but the race was amazing both teams perfromed like the top tier champs they are!
[2022-12-23 18:56:28] <YahtzeeUk> Think the soak shit spawns slower so more time before you die
[2022-12-23 18:56:28] <%Critzor> Blizz can actually see wether they pull or not and maybe it was happening off stream
[2022-12-23 18:56:28] <%Sevax> No mate, just enjoy it! it could've been done the other way around, better them getting screwed than you guys!
[2022-12-23 18:56:28] <Ghostick> !wf
[2022-12-23 18:56:28] <@%^StreamElements> didn't get it, got 4th
[2022-12-23 18:56:28] <+Cuttlefishya> You dont think you would have killed it there either way?
[2022-12-23 18:56:28] <+Moinoooooooo> Anyway NA is one day ahead, race is biased from beginning
[2022-12-23 18:56:28] <dmauz22> It felt like overall nerf
[2022-12-23 18:56:29] <cappei> Fuck it. Blizzard nerfed the boss twice while you were either heading out of the venue or sleeping. Didn't hear any Liquid fans complaining at that time
[2022-12-23 18:56:29] <%+Alar1s> 5% boss HP and 50% reduced shield on the adds in intermission, right?
[2022-12-23 18:56:29] <%+Scummybearz> less overlaps?
[2022-12-23 18:56:29] <%MBL999> If they cant do it at this time, when should they nerf it then ?
[2022-12-23 18:56:31] <%+Ayasira> The outer circle came in slower so you had more space
[2022-12-23 18:56:32] <%Ali1331> The fog seemed way slower
[2022-12-23 18:56:34] <%MBL999> either you sleep or they sleep

[2022-12-23 18:56:36] <+and0rio> Cloud closed slower I think @naowh
[2022-12-23 18:56:36] <Doog45> anytime you go to sleep when two teams are sub 10% to a kill, you run the risk of losing a race, pretty simple, no need to feel weird about it
[2022-12-23 18:56:37] <%+vegass66> SL runes?
[2022-12-23 18:56:39] <+Rapid8989> they would have done the samething
[2022-12-23 18:56:45] <+Vaeny> Wasnt there less orbs as well
[2022-12-23 18:56:46] <+Gac_Ttv> not the shield?
[2022-12-23 18:56:49] <%quixef> @Naowh  Slightly adjusted the timing of events at the start of phase 3. -Reduced the rate at which motes of Storm-Energy are spawned. -Slowed the rate that the Raging Storm closes in.
[2022-12-23 18:56:49] <+Vaeny> so less healing intensive
[2022-12-23 18:56:49] <Sisma_93> enrage from 20 to 25 minutes
[2022-12-23 18:56:51] <%stepepega> i mean i don't think the nerf did THAT much then

[2022-12-23 19:16:09] <+and0rio> Honest opinion, it would have been more fair if the nerf was implemented in a couple hours, would have been still regular raid time for echo (9PM) and liquid would be raiding.  But considering you guys were outperforming, still deserved the win.
