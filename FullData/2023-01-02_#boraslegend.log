[2023-01-02 00:22:42] <@%^Nightbot> Boras supports Lazio because they came to his home town in Sweden in a pre-season tour to play against his local team. When Boras saw all of Lazio's legendary players and the best Scandinavian manager in history (SGE) at the helm, he couldn't help but fall in love with Lazio.
