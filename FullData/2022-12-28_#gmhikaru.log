[2022-12-28 11:39:49] <ViingadoR> Hikaru is doubting him, Hikaru might be thinking rn: the zoomer doesn't know the KID

[2022-12-28 11:52:05] <ahontermosthont> @spenceee13 its just sterotype that all best chess players are INTJ cause they have long plan blu bluh bluh but both hikaru and magnus are ISTP and sometimes ISTP can be better in strategy games than INTJs

[2022-12-28 11:54:27] <%kappaklausisreal> black is virtually "up a pawn" but then it's the d6 pawn. I suspect if white can activate their rooks in a timely fashion it's gonna be equal

[2022-12-28 12:27:09] <%+z0sense> FIONA you are not logged into twitch?
[2022-12-28 12:27:10] <@%ChaeDoc> Eric Hansen 5-head. Well rested for Blitz
[2022-12-28 12:27:10] <tetris_tj11> @Fiona did Hikaru won?
[2022-12-28 12:27:18] <dannyjb2141__> is it one overall competition or a separate rapid and blitz?
[2022-12-28 12:27:23] <supermanclark063088> its bec. they embrace the engines. the softwares during there practice.
[2022-12-28 12:27:31] <%+JarateMan006> no he drew
[2022-12-28 12:27:31] <yogishyam> Is Vidit within the goal?
[2022-12-28 12:27:31] <AtuV_Hierophant> @tetris_tj11 no Hikadrew
[2022-12-28 12:27:31] <!%fionchetta> @z0sense yes i am?
[2022-12-28 12:27:32] <ttenhou> naka won?
[2022-12-28 12:27:33] <+RaisedByChozos> separate
[2022-12-28 12:27:35] <valentindorneanu2017> i bet blunders will be very confortable - at their home - in blitz
[2022-12-28 12:27:36] <supermanclark063088> and tune up games.
[2022-12-28 12:27:43] <Schokolokos7> this game even I could win
[2022-12-28 12:27:52] <tetris_tj11> @tetris_tj11 Oh :(

[2022-12-28 12:27:54] <epicgamer123420> caruana / dubov only half a point behind magnus/vlad i think could also win
[2022-12-28 12:27:59] <%+Dutcchy> Artemiev will have a benefit over the win on Magnus in the tiebreak, right?
[2022-12-28 12:28:01] <uzeddy> hIkArU WoN???

[2022-12-28 14:40:10] <katakuri4life> honestly ban him
[2022-12-28 14:40:21] <%+ne0narg0n> So is the Blitz a tournament on its own with separate prizes or is this just one big tournament?
[2022-12-28 14:40:26] <fufuboyyy> why is it odd number of rounds? so unfair some people get more whites than others
[2022-12-28 14:40:28] <twenty_two_and_a_half> @209wuut No Hikaru is
