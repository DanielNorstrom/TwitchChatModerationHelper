[2022-12-11 06:56:55] <Hi_Its_Crimson> Rapaport cat is hilarious
[2022-12-11 06:57:11] <!%Silencyr> Because of food sanitary laws in the U.S cate cafes aren't allowed to make food or drinks. But they can have food brought in from somewhere else if it's wrapped. and they can sell you a cup of hot water and a tea bag or a keurig style coffee
[2022-12-11 06:57:24] <$Burning_Fyre> yea the derp cat that jsut wants love then Rapaports like "AhHHH its a weird cat"

[2022-12-11 06:59:30] <%StromkoPenguin> US authorities are probably just desperately trying to keep toxoplasmosis levels under control so the cats don't take over entirely.

[2022-12-11 09:28:57] <%StromkoPenguin> I used an air fryer for tater tots, fries, chicken strips, etc, so stuff that was already kinda fried and it just had the quality of being cooked in an oven. An oven that has to be exhaustively cleaned every batch.

[2022-12-11 09:40:07] <%hasenpfefferoni> fun fact: apparently natural salmon is not pink / light colored. Its meat is actually gray for the real deal wild-caught

[2022-12-11 09:40:25] <%lorenzoteague> @hasenpfefferoni Correct!! 😄👍
[2022-12-11 09:40:33] <%StromkoPenguin> In the U.S., pretty much every salmon I've ever eaten has been very pink because they dye it 'salmon color', and the dye doesn't go away when it's cooked.
[2022-12-11 09:40:34] <krogbear> One time I had sushi from work and it had tape in it. I thought it was shrimp shells but it was fucking tape

[2022-12-11 09:41:46] <%StromkoPenguin> I heard sharks now have a horrendous ammonia odor because they soak up all the pollution that's in the fish they eat.
[2022-12-11 09:41:50] <Hi_Its_Crimson> grey meat in a salmon is the fatty layer
[2022-12-11 09:41:53] <%lorenzoteague> @hasenpfefferoni Yeah, I know..... lol
[2022-12-11 09:41:58] <doom_bringer007> it's smooth one way and jagged the other
[2022-12-11 09:42:02] <krogbear> Needless to say I demanded a refund for the shit they put in my sushi, and I didn’t touch any until they got the fuck head chef who made it replaced
