[2022-12-27 17:41:01] <cookieexdvr> hey @Baker and chat, i just got back into the game and i wanna level up a reaper, is there any pass i could get myself, those things that get a character to lvl 50 instantly, forgot what they're called
[2022-12-27 17:41:11] <%+FireZky> yeah, its free
[2022-12-27 17:41:15] <%+FireZky> didn't even watch anything
[2022-12-27 17:41:19] <%Kwadrat_> cookie depending where did u end
[2022-12-27 17:41:22] <%Kwadrat_> ifu have t3 char
[2022-12-27 17:41:24] <%+FireZky> we did it with learning party with first try
[2022-12-27 17:41:29] <%Kwadrat_> u should get power pass and express event
[2022-12-27 17:41:43] <cookieexdvr> i have a 1380character, i think i used my punika pass
[2022-12-27 17:41:45] <%Grizzlybooey> it's arguably the easiest g1 along with clown
[2022-12-27 17:41:54] <cookieexdvr> is there any other pass i could get?

[2022-12-27 17:43:07] <cookieexdvr> if i have any
[2022-12-27 17:43:10] <winahane> one to feiton also
[2022-12-27 17:43:23] <%Kwadrat_> during creating char u should be able to use power pass
[2022-12-27 17:43:32] <%Kwadrat_> but u might have it in game mail to claim
[2022-12-27 17:43:48] <%Kwadrat_> so first log ur main and check inventory/mail/universal storage
[2022-12-27 17:43:56] <%+FireZky> if u have char click powerpass button
[2022-12-27 17:44:03] <%+FireZky> then u see if u can use 1 or u need buy one
[2022-12-27 17:44:03] <%+Arwya0203> r u doing 1-4 in this grp?

[2022-12-27 18:06:36] <%Kwadrat_> every wednesday at 9 am server time and servers are back usually 12-1
[2022-12-27 18:07:37] <%SyzzAMV> but bard shields are positionals- it's much easier for mechanics to be close to boss on most fights- especially if you have spec movement
[2022-12-27 18:08:08] <+북미모코코 (lostgoldriver)> Yeah pally is better with hit masters
[2022-12-27 18:08:08] VIEWERS: 593
[2022-12-27 18:08:12] <%Kwadrat_> its also preffered to be close because shield is your 2nd highest meter generator
[2022-12-27 18:08:21] <LordAcid> the main reason you shield back attackers as bard is that the skill gives lot of meter
[2022-12-27 18:08:57] <%SyzzAMV> ^ ah that's also true, a lot of skills require you to be on boss to gain meter
[2022-12-27 18:09:14] <%SyzzAMV> I can follow a GS hip-hoppin all around
[2022-12-27 18:09:18] <%SyzzAMV> I can't**
[2022-12-27 18:09:18] <%Kwadrat_> bard generates much more bars if it plays close range which sux with ranged classes
[2022-12-27 18:09:35] <%Kwadrat_> and one of it dps buffs is positional and also debuff
[2022-12-27 18:09:42] <%Kwadrat_> so u want to place it next to boss
