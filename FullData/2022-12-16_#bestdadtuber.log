[2022-12-16 07:22:50] <@%sesamefig> @kurohanageist we are playing around with the f stop and ISO and yeh.. we will play around some more
[2022-12-16 07:23:08] <@%sesamefig> I wonder if we can use a different stronger ring light so we don’t have to increase ISO
[2022-12-16 07:23:19] <cherrimode> what kind of puzzle you doing?

[2022-12-16 07:35:40] <TechyOracle> @FallenShadowDevotee I've heard part of the issue is they utilized modern hardware to have farther rendering. Which ends up butchering the fog, and the impact of the fog.

[2022-12-16 10:04:59] <+vamorrison55> oh that isnt bad
[2022-12-16 10:05:06] <+vamorrison55> yeah but they might come with you
[2022-12-16 10:05:21] <+vamorrison55> they tend to attach to belongings not people
[2022-12-16 10:05:28] <+vamorrison55> but i havent studied it too much
[2022-12-16 10:05:40] <+vamorrison55> yep like a teddy bear doll etc
[2022-12-16 10:05:42] <%shroomder> i have three and a half ghosts attached ...or at least following me.
[2022-12-16 10:05:53] <+vamorrison55> shroom do they leave your house?
[2022-12-16 10:06:16] <%shroomder> the Half is one that managed to haunt mine and my wife
[2022-12-16 10:06:28] <+vamorrison55> course demons normally attach more than ghosts not sure if ghosts are as vicious
[2022-12-16 10:06:50] VIEWERS: 62
[2022-12-16 10:07:02] <+vamorrison55> sounds like you might have a demon among the ghosts if they are attaching to your wife
[2022-12-16 10:07:46] <+vamorrison55> true i have seen that in the movies
[2022-12-16 10:07:58] <%shroomder> ones my grandpa. and the other three arrived with gifts my wife sent me.  the half ghost seemed to somehow get split between my tebbybear and their stuffed dragon...
[2022-12-16 10:08:15] <+vamorrison55> so they can learn your weaknesses and then they join your life to draw off your pain and agony
[2022-12-16 10:08:22] <+vamorrison55> it is destructive healing for them
[2022-12-16 10:08:41] <+vamorrison55> i have watched a lot of demonic and ghost situations

[2022-12-16 10:57:34] <+VivaVibeVT> Hi Dad <3 I haven't slept yet, but to be honest, I've been in here the entire time. I was just doing some Valorant matches in the background.
[2022-12-16 10:57:46] <LovelyStatic> good!! just finished my daily challenges and such on Overwatch so I'm just relaxing now. the handcam is a cool touch especially with the legos!
[2022-12-16 10:58:25] <+VivaVibeVT> Considering that I haven't slept in almost two days, I'm not quite  sure. But I've been playing fairly well it seems.

Problem: I have to email my professor back (she emailed me two days ago) and I’ve kept forgetting to and now I don’t know if I can even respond. I also don’t know my grade in my main Chem lecture. If I’ve failed both of these, I need to figure out how to explain this to my parents without them blowing up on me. Instead of making me pay rent, my dad’s now making me give him progress reports on how my classes are and if I get good grades,]

[2022-12-16 11:24:52] <Nirrri117> If I get good grades, I don’t have to pay and my rent and I don’t have to get yelled at. But if I get bad grades I know both parents will yell. I already understand all of the mistakes and consequences, but they don’t seem to get that and Im not sure they will even if I try to tell them (I have in the past and they’ve just ignored me). How do I manage this/what do I even do here?

[2022-12-16 12:00:15] <Nirrri117> Braids are my favorite only cause they look best on me
[2022-12-16 12:00:23] <%$littleshyfox_> I would rather cut my hair XD
[2022-12-16 12:00:33] <Nirrri117> I like shorter hair lmao
[2022-12-16 12:00:48] <Nirrri117> I have a side shave myself
[2022-12-16 12:00:50] <LovelyStatic> Thank you dad. Also are you able to read books that aren't public domain?
[2022-12-16 12:00:56] <+Colizmoo> I have long hair but I like it down, keeping it up keeps it out of your face but it's not my style

[2022-12-16 12:48:20] <StrapStreams> it was interesting, when I saw cork I was confused because my first thought was the sound corks make when you pop them out of a bottle and I'd consider that loud for an ASMR thing, so this was a pleasant surprise

[2022-12-16 12:49:34] <White_Blaze> when the batteries finally died on mine and i had to replace them, not only did i replace the batteries, but i went to the next level and actually modified my digivice toy so all i had to do was press down on a piece of paperclip to complete the cricket that kept track of the steps counted. which basically tricked the toy into thinking i was constantly walking. i thought it pretty cleaver back then LUL

[2022-12-16 13:07:53] <White_Blaze> ..oh dear lord these ads. i just saw one for "funnest airport security photos" and it showed someone holding thier hands out, and as hand pistol was located in their bum. literally IN their butt on the X-ray scan. I dont even know how one would FIT a handgun in there, much less a loaded one. - but i fail to see how that is funny'
[2022-12-16 13:08:53] <+Colizmoo> I'm guessing they've only coded that for the only 2 ducks that are capable of going out of bounds
