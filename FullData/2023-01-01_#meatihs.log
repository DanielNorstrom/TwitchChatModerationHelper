[2023-01-01 06:16:08] <dull_bulb> It's not fully random, it's from left to right (most minions attacks first) and attacks are controlled by taunt and other mechanics

[2023-01-01 06:54:10] <+Impotter> if druid draws good they can just outlast
[2023-01-01 06:54:18] <+datfrogger> worst MU is some deck that can actually clear the giant minions/boards

[2023-01-01 08:25:10] <%+TheSphinx1906> that nerf is targeting Druid to (again) cover up for the issue with Bran...
[2023-01-01 08:25:21] <chrisvel89> and if he goes wide you can get some cocs

[2023-01-01 08:30:03] <%+TheSphinx1906> Astalor is in 60% of decks...Renny and Sire topped out at 50...
[2023-01-01 08:30:05] <%Vengeance_88> @caquico_ Holy shit didnt expect that much its insane

[2023-01-01 08:31:57] <chrisvel89> PLEASE SLOW DOWN
[2023-01-01 08:32:10] <oyoyoy_> true
[2023-01-01 08:32:20] <caquico_> @vengeance_88 “by the end of your turn” or just nerf Brann
[2023-01-01 08:32:29] <caquico_> Brann is the problem of everything
[2023-01-01 08:32:39] <Pinuz1> @Vengeance_88 nerf all the manathirst, make em 5-8-10
[2023-01-01 08:32:41] <%Zargath_> i think astalor is fine but should somehow be limited to only 1 use and no copies
[2023-01-01 08:32:43] <%Vengeance_88> @caquico_ Nah man its never brann only druid plays brann
[2023-01-01 08:32:50] <revelin55> neutral ass
[2023-01-01 08:32:55] <%+TheSphinx1906> It's only valid if they are causing all games to play out the same (like Sire did)...Astalor doesn't warp every game...
[2023-01-01 08:32:58] <chrisvel89> change astalor to a deathrattle
[2023-01-01 08:33:08] <%Vengeance_88> I think they will make the middle one manathirst 8 thats all
[2023-01-01 08:33:21] <glassmarbletp> they can make it manathirst 11
[2023-01-01 08:33:21] <chrisvel89> not being a battery would kill the Brann interaction
[2023-01-01 08:33:22] <oyoyoy_> astalor to end of turn is best idea
[2023-01-01 08:33:22] <caquico_> Maybe a nerf could be “by the end of your turn split the damage” so cant abuse with Brann?
[2023-01-01 08:33:39] VIEWERS: 738
[2023-01-01 08:33:41] <caquico_> Exactly, not battlecry just end turn effect
[2023-01-01 08:34:09] <%Vengeance_88> It would be weird that the previous 2 forms are battlecry and the last isnt
[2023-01-01 08:34:18] <%Vengeance_88> Blizzard doesnt like complicated stuff like that
[2023-01-01 08:34:32] <%Zargath_> make it hit random targets (including yourself) Kappa
[2023-01-01 08:34:32] <caquico_> Hmm maybe just normal form battlecry
[2023-01-01 08:34:46] <caquico_> And 5 form at the end of your turn gain 5 armor
[2023-01-01 08:34:51] <caquico_> If manathirst obv
[2023-01-01 08:34:55] <%+TheSphinx1906> Astalor is fine, IMO...it's a 3-step 10man finisher...you actually spend like 17 mana to get to do 18 damage and you have to keep it dead in your hand for at least 2 turns...cards like that are fine...
[2023-01-01 08:35:15] <monstroh> astalor is the problem here

[2023-01-01 11:29:24] <%Vengeance_88> At this point we need more significant buffs than nerfs

[2023-01-01 11:29:47] <cizuss> @prabh23 yeah, rokara nerfed to 9 mana, shield shatter back to 3 damage
[2023-01-01 11:29:55] <darkhydra10> @cizuss blizzard has a dying kid who likes a thief, don't overdo it, we have the 4-player spell from the demo, which costs more while you can summon a maximum of 9/9

[2023-01-01 11:31:18] <prabh23> They legit changed how the card functioned
[2023-01-01 11:31:20] <TerkBS> Is there only one class?
[2023-01-01 11:31:31] <prabh23> Every nerf now is +1 mana

[2023-01-01 11:32:31] <cizuss> i'm not saying sinstone doesn't need a nerf, but removing stealth is enough, why make it 4 mana as well
[2023-01-01 11:32:39] <prabh23> If they wanna be equivalent draka would gain attack for every mana spent
[2023-01-01 11:32:58] <+bwmlax14> @cizuss slow the game down
[2023-01-01 11:33:03] <prabh23> And sinstone would be based on mana spent
[2023-01-01 11:33:05] <prabh23> Not cards
[2023-01-01 11:33:12] <prabh23> That’s how they’d nerf it in warrior loo
[2023-01-01 11:33:19] <%katinent> HUH
[2023-01-01 11:33:27] <prabh23> But since it’s rogue it gets a small plus 1 mana and called good
[2023-01-01 11:33:37] <%Vengeance_88> Blizzard said that mana cheating is rogue's identity so they will never change it
[2023-01-01 11:33:39] <Hiravr46> You mean the hs player purple penis?
[2023-01-01 11:33:58] <cizuss> @bwmlax14 at 4 mana and no stealth it's a way worse questing adventurer
[2023-01-01 11:34:01] <prabh23> @vengeance_88 They don’t follow class identities anymore every class breaks their identity
