[2022-12-07 00:03:52] <%1stubyturtle> @hermysko either way I'm never getting 1
[2022-12-07 00:03:57] <White_Blaze> if the toy is even half out of ya, it aint gonna do shit for ya no matter what your size is. and it comes down to a failure in design. too many moving parts without a solid core structure to basically keep it from bending too much, and the parts that need to be doing the thrusting are too far out on the design to be effective really. take a look on the website and see the design it gives on the inside view and you can see the fail for yourself from a structural standpoint. @NoodleWolfVT

[2022-12-07 00:07:54] <!%admiral_frostbite> @White_Blaze I mean if you're good enough to be designing actual structural components I don't think sex toy company is high on the list usually of places you strive to work at.

[2022-12-07 00:09:54] <%Tadas13571> for me the closest feeling that I can describe the feeling of caring about someone for me is  like I'm willing to do anything for them to a unreasonable degree to were I am willing to give everything if it means that they are happy or health and if anyone would anyone every touch them or hurt them either physical or emotional I get irrationality angry

[2022-12-07 01:28:11] <%KaiSakurai> @NautAJerman had a 6* fighting tera espeon yesterday... most annoying raid EVER. insane sp atk and def. phys attackers did no dmg due to tickle spam. moves like fake tears to reduce its sp def didnt work due to magic bounce ability... and steel or dark type pokemon to reduce/negate the psychic dmg were screwed by fighting type tera blast... since tera blast uses the highest attack stat of the 2 it used the insane sp atk

Lost in the dark, we surrender our minds and forget who we are. But some of us have woken up. They remind us that we all have a choice. To stand, not kneel. To oppose, not obey. To live, not just exist.
