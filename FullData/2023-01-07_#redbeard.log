[2023-01-07 09:48:53] <!%GeordieTwitch> Overcooking is unhealthy, but undercooking can also be a concern. If you use too much heat and burn the meat, it will form harmful compounds like polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and heterocyclic amines, which are associated with cancer
[2023-01-07 09:49:17] <%+ChucklesBiscotti> yeah think it's literally cut from both sides of the pig's spine, usually it's crunchy by default and I think you'd probably like it
