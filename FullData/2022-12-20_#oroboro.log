[2022-12-20 03:58:14] <%Evil_on_Paper> Chess boxing, or chessboxing, is a hybrid sport that combines two traditional disciplines: chess and boxing. Two combatants play alternating rounds of blitz chess and boxing until one wins by checkmate or knockout.
[2022-12-20 03:58:26] <theIMPimp> ok but hear me out; Chess Boxing but you aren't allowed to take the gloves off

[2022-12-20 03:58:44] <Austinkane> @evil_on_paper don't they have it where they box for a round, then play like 5 minutes of chess then back to boxing
[2022-12-20 03:59:07] <%Evil_on_Paper> IDK. Never sat down to watch it. Just kinda went "huh" and had it stuck in my head
[2022-12-20 03:59:07] <%$XdaXcaptainX> how often do checkmates realistically happen in chessboxing? i feel like most of the time they gotta just get a good pop to the head in and win in the boxing part

[2022-12-20 04:14:15] <@%Pallydan9K> full combo into offhand heysel pick into max speed soul greatsword
[2022-12-20 04:14:16] <%KungFuAndrew> @StryfeDragon The fashion in DS3 is considerably better than ER, I'll give it that
[2022-12-20 04:14:20] <%+Fafniroth> I tried magic in DS3, it was mostly a disappointment but some spells were fun to support my MGS/Onyx Blade build
[2022-12-20 04:14:20] <xkryptii> @kungfuandrew good. How do you get better gear? And stats?
[2022-12-20 04:14:32] <%Evil_on_Paper> Got 12 poise, take it or leave it pvpNo
[2022-12-20 04:14:44] <@%Pallydan9K> If you look at bloodstains here, you can see people get deathblighted
[2022-12-20 04:14:44] <%+Setis_Dagre> I thought you actually wanted 76 since the poise value of a lot of attacks was 75?
[2022-12-20 04:14:46] <%+whitebat_ivi> ive been playing ER all year and still finding new fashion
[2022-12-20 04:14:50] <xkryptii> Is there an ‚Äúend game‚Äù where you beat the game as well?
[2022-12-20 04:15:07] <Metallicfender> I got some zero poise build. Helps to have a ash of war with hyper armor
[2022-12-20 04:15:07] <@%Pallydan9K> There are 6 endings
[2022-12-20 04:15:07] <%+Fafniroth> moonveil R2 deals 75 so you want 76
[2022-12-20 04:15:14] <%KungFuAndrew> @xkryptii You gain stats by beating enemies to gain runes. Runes = XP. There are also one-time use consumables that give various amounts of runes to level up. You get gear by finding it in the wild, purchasing it from shops, or random drops from mobs.
[2022-12-20 04:15:16] <!%$StryfeDragon> @StryfeDragon I was able to make dragon form look good. I did the impossible: A dragon build that eats his meals.

[2022-12-20 04:17:00] <!%Ebonslayer> @KungFuAndrew Eh, I think ER fashion is second to DS2. A long second, but still second.
[2022-12-20 04:17:15] <%KungFuAndrew> @xkryptii That's fair. And to advise you on that, they are patching Elden Ring to balance out it's rough edges every 2 months or so

[2022-12-20 04:38:46] <%$KungFuAndrew> My favorite Oro video is the Oro's Arsenal with Blacksteel Katana. The way you just dismantle people in that vid makes me smile to this day
[2022-12-20 04:39:16] <%+ItIsGimp> that was my favorite weapon in DS2 as well
[2022-12-20 04:39:22] VIEWERS: 792
[2022-12-20 04:39:32] <%+ItIsGimp> also loved the alonne bow
[2022-12-20 04:39:48] <TurdBurgs> My favorite video is the first Quest for Hatemail. I remember watching that one day, and just going "omg this guy is the antichrist to these guys" LUL
[2022-12-20 04:39:49] <$umbasaFGC> i didnt know about praise the sun until recently :(
[2022-12-20 04:39:52] <%$KungFuAndrew> I remember you mentioning that person in your vid. Are they no longer with us?
[2022-12-20 04:40:01] <rustytoeknife> Is there any confirmed DLC for Elden RIng yet? Stare CaneTime
[2022-12-20 04:40:01] <%everypopisanemergency> he died?
[2022-12-20 04:40:03] <+Cyphereous> Gotta give it to the Helix Halberd for creativity though
[2022-12-20 04:40:09] <SenApollo> Can you believe I watched through every minute of Oro and Peeve's pure black playthrough?
[2022-12-20 04:40:09] <TurdBurgs> Quest For Hatemail was my intro to Oro
[2022-12-20 04:40:14] <SenApollo> that was... a long journey

[2022-12-20 04:41:54] <Captainqueef1996> i would use the gargoyles black halberd if they were actually all black like the ones they use
[2022-12-20 04:41:54] <the_musko> the worst
[2022-12-20 04:42:00] <AndrogynousRye> ER gargoyles go nuts
[2022-12-20 04:42:12] <+Cyphereous> They're just resistant to everything and immune to all statuses, it's absurd
[2022-12-20 04:42:14] <Shadow04> Double Crucible Knight too
[2022-12-20 04:42:22] <%$R8NDOM1> what level is oro now?
[2022-12-20 04:42:26] <+leg_disabler> gargoyles move too much and the poison dmg build up is cancer
[2022-12-20 04:42:28] <EVVYmusic> what about 2 of those cat statues
[2022-12-20 04:42:29] <%+Fafniroth> DS1 Gargoyle Halberd is my favourite weapon in that game
[2022-12-20 04:42:30] <%$KungFuAndrew> The double crucible knight exists just to teach you how to parry
[2022-12-20 04:42:30] <ungarette> kill him elaDevious
[2022-12-20 04:42:32] <EVVYmusic> those things fuck you up
[2022-12-20 04:42:37] <%everypopisanemergency> was it ds3 that had a lot of doubles?
[2022-12-20 04:42:42] <llyamisanll> The Duo omen twins were cool
[2022-12-20 04:42:42] <+rhyno1394> The godskin duo are stupid easy if you abuse sleep
[2022-12-20 04:43:00] <@%Pallydan9K> Oro do you want to try crystal throwing knives on them to short circuit them
[2022-12-20 04:43:04] <ungarette> @llyamisanll 4 kings vibes
[2022-12-20 04:43:10] <%$KungFuAndrew> @everypopisanemergency Pretty much every game has had duo bosses at varying degrees. I think ER has the most so far
[2022-12-20 04:43:13] <not_a_cat_okk> Hey oro, why do people never use blaspheme claw against malekith?

[2022-12-20 04:43:27] <@%Pallydan9K> people aren't good at parrying
[2022-12-20 04:43:36] <@%Pallydan9K> it's part of Bernahl's questline
[2022-12-20 04:43:47] <CabbitGurl> I liked the duo gargoyles, the godskin duo I oneshot, but they were annoying that it was more like the Godskin quadruple
[2022-12-20 04:43:49] <@%Pallydan9K> ...people don't care about Bernahl oroSad
[2022-12-20 04:44:03] <+Silthous> don't forget about double crucible knights. Or the triple scarlet rot crystalians
[2022-12-20 04:44:03] <internetexplorerer> The parry frames are hot garbage on it. Get hit every time
[2022-12-20 04:44:03] <TurdBurgs> Oro and Peeve Four Kings is my favorite piece of cinema. "Oh nooooo Peeve. You're dead. Ope. I'm dead. You're dead. We're all dead." and it's just 25 mins of that
[2022-12-20 04:44:08] <%$KungFuAndrew> I only saw one vid parrying with blasphemous claw, and it looked insanely hard to pull off. It's also so far out of the way that most people would probably miss it (like me!)
[2022-12-20 04:44:10] <@%Pallydan9K> Bernahl is my homie, he solos godskin duo for me sometimes
[2022-12-20 04:44:15] <EVVYmusic> what is your goal right now
[2022-12-20 04:44:19] <@%Pallydan9K> He inspires me to hurt people
[2022-12-20 04:44:21] <ungarette> @llyamisanll No no, the black environment
[2022-12-20 04:44:27] <Austinkane> Bernhal makes the godskin duo fight easy
[2022-12-20 04:44:35] <%Harukosama11> it ranks up there with Citizen Kane tbh

[2022-12-20 04:46:10] <@%Pallydan9K> So if you want to invade people going through the game, you go 200
[2022-12-20 04:46:38] <!%$StryfeDragon> 200 is also probably the final breakpoint where your build can still be a build, albeit at its max potential.'

[2022-12-20 06:21:15] <TheRealWholehorse> 83 is a hot breakpoint since it gets power stance moves, fists, and HTS.

[2022-12-20 06:26:10] <!%+Nekracyst> Maybe DLC? :-)

[2022-12-20 06:26:28] <powerless_imp0> just go to gerudo desert or something
[2022-12-20 06:26:33] <!%+Nekracyst> To be fair Desert is the only region they dont really cover in terms of biomes within Elden Ring
[2022-12-20 06:26:35] <%bilge_party> frigid desert? sand deer?
[2022-12-20 06:26:40] <%$hugostiglitz71> Copium maybe
[2022-12-20 06:26:42] <!%+Nekracyst> So if there was going to be a DLC, Desert would be a good biome to cover
[2022-12-20 06:26:44] <wok6399> holy shit. didnt know there is a dungeon

[2022-12-20 06:29:05] <%KungFuAndrew> @Valkryna I'm wondering if they are adding that. My modding friend who does Torrent mods said they completely changed the file structure for the horse, making it impossible to use old modding methods. Makes me wonder if they are preparing customization
[2022-12-20 06:29:09] <kid__gorgeous> I wouldn't really give a shit about torrent customization myself
[2022-12-20 06:29:34] <Valkryna> @kungfuandrew oh shit really? That's really interesting. I'd love them to give us *something* more for torrent
[2022-12-20 06:29:42] <iFailedEnglish> I would take literal horse armor dlc and I would actually be happy about it
[2022-12-20 06:29:44] <powerless_imp0> I really hope they let us shade our armor, or at least the non metal parts of our armor
[2022-12-20 06:29:58] <%Patchwork___> Well, Torrent is barely a horse so LUL

[2022-12-20 06:30:25] <%KungFuAndrew> @Valkryna Specifically, she said that it's impossible to alter the packs on his hind quarters since 1.08.
[2022-12-20 06:30:30] <powerless_imp0> was it meant to be a feature or more of a dev tool
[2022-12-20 06:30:35] <!%$Mohl97> you misremembered the video oro
[2022-12-20 06:30:51] <%Imp_Loader> theyll sell horse armor as dlc
[2022-12-20 06:30:55] <vilecrois> we already have enough bright green abominations walking about without being able to do that as well lol
[2022-12-20 06:30:58] <Austinkane> I'd love to change the colors on my armor

[2022-12-20 06:31:13] <suspiciouslymissingsock> Does two handing the bolt of gransax make the L2 stronger?
[2022-12-20 06:31:20] <!%$Mohl97> it wasn't cut or anything, they just used it as a technique to save resources on reskins like the different burger kings and knights
[2022-12-20 06:31:32] <%Patchwork___> I remember dying in Sofia and winding up in this bossfight way way earlier

[2022-12-20 06:31:39] <Valkryna> @kungfuandrew hmm I know the packs would sometimes bug out and not appear. hopefully it's not just a fix for that and it's something for future dlc. Horse armor dlc when seecatWow
[2022-12-20 06:32:01] <iFailedEnglish> More armor customization other than just removing the cape would be cool, like I wanna take the head off the front of the twinned armor chestpiece for example

[2022-12-20 06:32:44] <%KungFuAndrew> @Valkryna Prior to 1.08, she was able to remove the packs altogether. It does make the horse look a lot better. I have been wishing for Torrent customizations forever
[2022-12-20 06:32:51] <%CabbitGurl> Mimic tear fight is pretty interesting rooAww
[2022-12-20 06:33:12] <Metallicfender> That‚Äôs what I usually do when I‚Äôm speed running a new character
[2022-12-20 06:33:17] <powerless_imp0> it's interesting how they made one AI for all enemies instead of their usual deal where they make one for each NPC, which is probably because of that enemy in particular
[2022-12-20 06:33:18] <!%$StryfeDragon> Hot take, they should make mimic significantly harder if it detects you walking in with no armor
[2022-12-20 06:33:23] <powerless_imp0> so that they had one thing to use all gear
[2022-12-20 06:33:29] <+volcanetv> stripping is going pretty far but at least removing right hand weapon is quick
[2022-12-20 06:33:29] <%primal_xl> then you have the other naked mimics that hit like trucks
[2022-12-20 06:33:32] <@%Pallydan9K> personally it's fun to see what the AI might think of doing with my build
[2022-12-20 06:33:46] <@%Pallydan9K> could learn something

[2022-12-20 06:47:40] <iFailedEnglish> Whether or not I can get behind Skywind depends on how many of its mechanics they recreate

[2022-12-20 07:14:00] <Rennat47> A switch pro that uses a new NVIDA chip that allows for DLSS would be nice while not making hard for developers
[2022-12-20 07:14:02] <NeroIscariot12> Valve is the only one that can make back the money lost on every deck's production through steam game sales. Nintendo rarely sells at loss.
[2022-12-20 07:14:03] <HoraceConch> Nintendo only has more backlash to look forward to with every new game that comes out on the current switch lol

[2022-12-20 07:19:13] <powerless_imp0> BOTW 2, silk song  (hopefully) armored core VI, final fantasy XVI, what am I forgetting
[2022-12-20 07:19:16] <suspiciouslymissingsock> Is there anywhere I can read or watch the lore that GRRM specifically wrote for Elden Ring? Or was that never specified other than that it took places thousands of years before the game.
[2022-12-20 07:19:16] <%theIMPimp> Elden Ring? who plays that? Clueless
[2022-12-20 07:19:22] <pantsu__god> @powerless_imp0 possibly er dlc

[2022-12-20 07:19:32] <%CoffeeSack> @thedopestjedi just to name a few, Dead Space remake, Resident Evil 4 remake, Wo Long, Armored Core 6, Space Skyrim (hopefully) from top of my head
[2022-12-20 07:19:34] <suolirusetti> games like Elden Ring DLC, new downloadable content for Elden Ring, expansion for Fromsoft's Elden Ring
[2022-12-20 07:19:41] <%thedopestjedi> How tf. Fromsoft has always had the most beautiful music.
[2022-12-20 07:19:53] <%thedopestjedi> Space Skyrim? What even is that?

[2022-12-20 07:22:56] <Unholy_Revenant> i dont think theyre players unless me, you, and lobos fought that lionell aromor with piercing and those skulls
[2022-12-20 07:23:00] <!%Ebonslayer> @DandyCheeks Then you're crazy.
[2022-12-20 07:23:01] <+DandyCheeks> just shouldnt be released for 20 years straight

[2022-12-20 07:24:06] <%MattCubedTf2> @DandyCheeks I had fun with skyrim, but would never say it was a great game
[2022-12-20 07:24:07] <!%Ebonslayer> @DandyCheeks Music is the only thing I'll say is good about Skyrim.
[2022-12-20 07:24:11] <daddydemonic> What did she give you @oroboro ?
[2022-12-20 07:24:11] <%thedopestjedi> Yeah. That‚Äôs a lot of work that modders gotta do. But the mods they have on Skyrim are literally game changing. I don‚Äôt have PC but I still mod the hell out of my Skyrim on Xbox.
[2022-12-20 07:24:16] <@%Pallydan9K> the other chance is getting the Great-jar's arsenal
