[2022-12-07 17:37:27] <%$Peaches_McCream> @skar_ lhcloudyMadge
[2022-12-07 17:37:43] <%geno69> i actually like the skin, glasses kinda weird though
[2022-12-07 17:37:45] <%Magicturtle12> unironically the "for you" section to the store is great, after you buy something from it it'll refresh instantly with something else it thinks you'll like tomatoMoney it's like a lootbox experience
[2022-12-07 17:37:45] <%+Skar_> @Peaches_McCream listen I hated sym in OW1
[2022-12-07 17:37:46] <Abstrct_Soley> she looks clapped
[2022-12-07 17:37:47] <+Batess> Smash
[2022-12-07 17:37:48] <Thevrex> i think the new pharah skin is way worse
[2022-12-07 17:37:49] <%bino_ln> did you play against bumper in owl?
[2022-12-07 17:37:51] <%$Peaches_McCream> I think it’s just the glasses lol
[2022-12-07 17:37:51] <%+soldiermain31415> how bad is doomfist to play against?
[2022-12-07 17:38:02] <%$Peaches_McCream> @skar_  how could you lhcloudySadge

[2022-12-07 17:39:13] <%+Aceattack> new map with rein lhcloudyHYPERS
[2022-12-07 17:39:16] <%MintJamz> Let's see if Kephrii has a spot for this map
[2022-12-07 17:39:21] <%$Peaches_McCream> Do it @emrehakan
[2022-12-07 17:39:25] <Abstrct_Soley> Make it 11!
[2022-12-07 17:39:29] <%emreHakan> I spent it on battlepass gege
[2022-12-07 17:39:41] <hgr126> how does the rank reset work though. do we gain sr/tier faster back to our last season sr, then normalise again?
[2022-12-07 17:39:42] <%Dapperjeff> poor kephrii, having to deal with this crazy ping as a dps hero
[2022-12-07 17:39:43] <hillopulla> i was plat5 at the end of season1. now im silver 4 even tho i havent played a single game of competitive. why is this a thing? i grinded the whole season 1 to get to plat just to go back to silver
[2022-12-07 17:39:46] <hapicreeper> wait is this the new map
[2022-12-07 17:39:50] <%sansaburo> wideVIBE
[2022-12-07 17:39:56] <hapicreeper> this map looks so strange
[2022-12-07 17:40:02] <raylx79> VIBE
[2022-12-07 17:40:02] <thiccguybilly> this is a junkrat map
[2022-12-07 17:40:04] <stepsisterfriede> course he does OMEGALUL
[2022-12-07 17:40:20] <hgr126> do we gain sr/tier faster back to our last season sr, then normalise again?
[2022-12-07 17:40:22] <buddys181> Yo cloudy what is your opinion about slugs?
[2022-12-07 17:40:24] <endcosmos> can't wait to play this map and not know where the fuck I'm going
[2022-12-07 17:40:34] <Abstrct_Soley> the map is le boring ResidentSleeper
[2022-12-07 17:40:34] <Lepoks> @hillopulla that's ow2 for you, very good system
[2022-12-07 17:40:34] <hillopulla> i spent the whole season 1 getting to plat, and then i got placed back to silver
[2022-12-07 17:40:39] <%+Aceattack> so spawn camp this map lhcloudyStats
[2022-12-07 17:40:44] <%geno69> dva ate those heals
[2022-12-07 17:41:07] <pulsedj_> does everyone have the sr boost
[2022-12-07 17:41:12] <%xPokesterx> @pulsedj_ yes
[2022-12-07 17:41:13] <hillopulla> thats nice to hear, i was about to uninstall
[2022-12-07 17:41:25] <pulsedj_> @pulsedj_ ty
[2022-12-07 17:41:29] <OneManArmystar> Dva does crazy damage but would rather face her than Hog or doom.
[2022-12-07 17:41:29] <%+Aceattack> everyone below diamond should have sr boost
[2022-12-07 17:41:39] <%xPokesterx> if u do ur placements ull prob go up by like 3 tiers in rank at least
[2022-12-07 17:41:59] <%+Aceattack> @xpokesterx you mean first rank up?
[2022-12-07 17:42:01] <%praisepizza> Sojourn best tank GIGACHAD
[2022-12-07 17:42:20] <hgr126> i feel this map is very good for rein
[2022-12-07 17:42:22] <%H0lyMongo> Why playing new MAP????
[2022-12-07 17:42:34] <%+Aceattack> it’s in ranked
[2022-12-07 17:42:34] <%xPokesterx> @Aceattack ye and ull have mmr boost till ur back where u were
[2022-12-07 17:43:03] <hgr126> it's like a mini kings row map, lots of narrow corridors
[2022-12-07 17:43:13] <%+Aceattack> pushing into uphill will require some tactical distractions
[2022-12-07 17:43:41] <%owKSAA> this reminds of blizzardwrld 2nd point when it got released LOL
[2022-12-07 17:43:44] <%owKSAA> me
[2022-12-07 17:44:09] <%Magicturtle12> KEKW hammered the tracer bomb
[2022-12-07 17:44:10] <%blackstrategy> GIGACHAD
[2022-12-07 17:44:12] <%+chorklit> this looks awful
[2022-12-07 17:44:13] <+Gloryallowed> I wanted to see second point :(
[2022-12-07 17:44:22] <ikebrda> ?
[2022-12-07 17:44:25] <%bino_ln> should be auto win on 1st point cap
[2022-12-07 17:44:29] <Hollow111> 2022 blizzard map design Okayeg
[2022-12-07 17:44:31] <%+Aceattack> @gloryallowed there are more uphills this map
[2022-12-07 17:44:35] <hapicreeper> taking inspiration from hanamura lmao
[2022-12-07 17:44:41] <sn3k_04> les go
[2022-12-07 17:44:43] <OneManArmystar> It's the worst map in OW
[2022-12-07 17:44:46] <+Gloryallowed> definitely defense sided
[2022-12-07 17:44:51] <%Magicturtle12> i like the map too
[2022-12-07 17:44:57] <hgr126> it's a rein map >:D
[2022-12-07 17:45:11] <%+Aceattack> so what advantage does ramattra have this map? long sight lines as they push uphill then transform for melee
[2022-12-07 17:45:17] <Roostergaming> isnt first point exact same pathing as the other new payload map?
[2022-12-07 17:45:22] <%bino_ln> it'ls literally an uphill bunker, very defensive oriented
[2022-12-07 17:45:29] <%praisepizza> THEVOICES
[2022-12-07 17:45:53] <@%aidreu> what map is most similar to this one
