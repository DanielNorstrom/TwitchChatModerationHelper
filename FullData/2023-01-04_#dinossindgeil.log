[2023-01-04 15:40:27] <@%voax> Elden Ring is pretty much ds2 2 Pog
[2023-01-04 15:40:32] <%EvilMuffins1> i love all of them, but ds2 is just the jankiest
[2023-01-04 15:40:33] <%remiri> for worldbuilding and such i agree with ds2 compared to er

[2023-01-04 15:40:37] <%DhufishHunter> @barrick_the_fighter there are not many actual bad hitboxes in DS2 if you have iframes. There are about the same number of bad hitboxes as DS1 and 3 its just that the agility stat exaggerates the problem.

[2023-01-04 17:03:35] <+Asparuch123> Demon Souls is also exclusive right?
[2023-01-04 17:03:39] <%Lovenewton98> he said he dislikes the lack of options i think, only 12 weapons
[2023-01-04 17:03:39] <%Captain_Domo> What is your favorite boss in all of fromsoft though? Hmmm
[2023-01-04 17:03:41] <%+juicybrick> im also in the minority of BB dislikers. Never really found myself enjoying the game
[2023-01-04 17:03:56] <luigipizzapies> i wish i could play demon souls :/
[2023-01-04 17:04:02] <%Lovenewton98> @juicybrick even the dlc?
[2023-01-04 17:04:06] <%+juicybrick> yeah
[2023-01-04 17:04:06] <@%voax> I enjoyed BB a lot, but it took me a while to get used to the (under) 30 fps performance

[2023-01-04 17:06:21] <%$Khaas_> @StahFahx_ I have an OLED, still no issues. 30fps is not the best, but not a big deal
[2023-01-04 17:06:22] <%+juicybrick> i wish the blood vials were like the grass in demon souls cause that was so much easier to get

[2023-01-04 17:06:33] <%MeMadeFox> BB isn't half as good without DLC imo tho

[2023-01-04 17:06:41] <+MeepTots> Loved BB but having to farm Blood Vials by running Forbidden Woods over and over got old
[2023-01-04 17:06:45] <%MrNinja1234> blood vials were either in super limited supply (early game) or practically infinite and that's not a good mechanic
[2023-01-04 17:06:48] <%+Vonto_m> also the thing i dislike about DeS
[2023-01-04 17:06:51] <%MeMadeFox> BB base game is kinda meh

[2023-01-04 18:03:17] <!%TurtleArmyJess> dont you have to do the giant memories to kill vendrick?
[2023-01-04 18:03:18] <LCorazza> Giant Souls for Vendrick
[2023-01-04 18:03:20] <!%TurtleArmyJess> Hi dooglie
[2023-01-04 18:03:20] <@%voax> but do they count as bosses?
[2023-01-04 18:03:28] <%MrNinja1234> that lets you fight Vendrick easier
[2023-01-04 18:03:37] <%LittleWing322> With the giant memories you make vendrick weaker
[2023-01-04 18:03:38] <%BenderZGreat> memories lower Vendrick's...defense or resistance or something?
[2023-01-04 18:03:41] <LanturnLunaR> the one in black gulch is easy to get
[2023-01-04 18:03:44] <%BenderZGreat> they're not mandatory but helpful
[2023-01-04 18:03:45] <+Barzonius> @Dooglie Whatever hes doing, he doesn't rotate so he does the same trick in switch and then back to goofy stance
[2023-01-04 18:03:45] <thaewrapt> You got 1 from AD, 1 from GL, 2 more from memories.
[2023-01-04 18:03:47] <%Baryon23> you can fight Vendrick whenever, but to get Aldia you need the crowns and stuff i thought
[2023-01-04 18:03:48] <%SofaBaron> my ds2 final was thron fighters then nashandra and then another ugly boss
[2023-01-04 18:03:51] <+freemanski> the giant souls just make him weak
[2023-01-04 18:03:53] <%sebman000> doit
[2023-01-04 18:03:55] <%MrNinja1234> your damage is lower against Vendrick the fewer giant souls you have
[2023-01-04 18:03:55] <LCorazza> @dinossindgeil That's his questline for crowns. The Giant Souls lower his defense. Else you do no damage
[2023-01-04 18:03:58] <@%voax> lets go to dlc Pog
[2023-01-04 18:04:04] <LCorazza> 4 Giant Souls is good. Max is 5
[2023-01-04 18:04:07] <thaewrapt> And one more from Giants in Black Gulch, forgot them. Total of 5.
[2023-01-04 18:04:08] <%BaZziks> can you level up your weapons ?
[2023-01-04 18:04:08] <@%voax> or jarjs
[2023-01-04 18:04:13] <%+Smomotion> they help with vendrick right?
[2023-01-04 18:04:13] <%+ecstasy_in_service> go jarjars
[2023-01-04 18:04:15] <@%voax> BaZziks yes he can
[2023-01-04 18:04:20] <%LittleWing322> 2nd one iirc
[2023-01-04 18:04:25] <%LittleWing322> For gargoyles
[2023-01-04 18:04:25] <thaewrapt> 4 souls Vendrick is doable.
[2023-01-04 18:04:25] <%Baryon23> did you get the bonfire after Ruin Sents?
[2023-01-04 18:04:25] <LCorazza> After Ruins Sentinels
