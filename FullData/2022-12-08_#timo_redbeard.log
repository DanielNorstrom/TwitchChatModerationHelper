[2022-12-08 20:03:12] <@%ATypicalRedhead> the problem with my set up is I only have one place to put an arm for a mic, itll have to hang upside down for me lol

[2022-12-08 20:03:51] <@%ATypicalRedhead> nope
[2022-12-08 20:03:55] <Bebopcola2021> Hmmm....wonder if the bottom would be better every other one?
[2022-12-08 20:03:56] <Guldbullen> the blue is good, the normal fire is to inviting
[2022-12-08 20:04:00] <%Caleb23395> not sure about the bottom ones
[2022-12-08 20:04:04] <@%ATypicalRedhead> cause the mist blocks a lot of the bottom ones
[2022-12-08 20:04:05] <%freshprince925> add the two outside ones. skip the two middles
[2022-12-08 20:04:07] <@%$the_mykosh> I think the torches at the bottom are a little OTT
[2022-12-08 20:04:24] <%+MissBubbles_1> My tolerance is so low I must have had too much cough medicine last night before bed and woke up at 2am hallucinating LUL It was wild
[2022-12-08 20:04:39] <@%$the_mykosh> that's better
[2022-12-08 20:04:44] <%freshprince925> then do the opposite above
[2022-12-08 20:04:45] <@$caelanish> sounds like a great time Bubbles
[2022-12-08 20:04:59] <%freshprince925> two middle, skip outside on top
[2022-12-08 20:05:00] <%Caleb23395> how about 1 flame torch in the middle except around the door way?
[2022-12-08 20:05:03] <%+MissBubbles_1> Not really 😂 I was quite dizzy too. But I survived

[2022-12-08 20:05:30] <%+MissBubbles_1> I mean, I was using it as directed. I’m just a lightweight I guess
[2022-12-08 20:05:30] <%rieljudoka> could make some small pits for campfires/hearths to give the impression of the orc pits if you wanted to be extra ott
[2022-12-08 20:05:39] <@%$the_mykosh> I think you need to light up those Yag tropies a little more
[2022-12-08 20:05:42] <Guldbullen> I woul dhave remove all at the bottom

[2022-12-08 20:09:43] <illuyer> It looks like Frank.

[2022-12-08 21:04:20] <%freshprince925> pepsi or coke
[2022-12-08 21:04:37] <Guldbullen> both are good as long as it i Max or Zero

[2022-12-08 21:04:41] <einherji101> coke was much better once
[2022-12-08 21:04:43] <%freshprince925> there is a right answer
[2022-12-08 21:04:51] <shamanaras> fun fact, people vote for coke, but in a blind test they chose for pepsi
[2022-12-08 21:05:04] <%$KaerieP> Also known as RC Cola

[2022-12-08 21:05:29] <%+MissBubbles_1> I mean, of course royal crown cola is the best, but it’s not really comparable to coke or pepsi
[2022-12-08 21:05:37] <%$KaerieP> "successful" lol
[2022-12-08 21:06:00] <%$DogBoy17112> is it a bikini team?
[2022-12-08 21:06:09] <%$KaerieP> Whether I prefer Coke or Pepsi depends on whether it's canned or from a soda fountain.
[2022-12-08 21:06:12] <%+Ruestir> @shamanaras Fun fact, I always chose Coke in those tests because I can taste the difference and Pepsi tastes like watered down and slightly flatter Coke.
[2022-12-08 21:06:13] <Guldbullen> from the devs?
[2022-12-08 21:06:20] <einherji101> vegvísir
[2022-12-08 21:06:24] <%$KaerieP> Canned I prefer Coke all day. From a fountain, they're more or less the same.
