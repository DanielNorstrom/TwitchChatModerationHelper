[2023-01-03 00:00:02] <maxlakhman> CAT S TEIR
[2023-01-03 00:00:05] <naughtyones> Damage and Ult charge need to be dropped across the board
[2023-01-03 00:00:06] <$dodgydaniel> overwatch should be 8v8
[2023-01-03 00:00:08] VIEWERS: 9¬†131
[2023-01-03 00:00:13] <falconzitshigh> Why
[2023-01-03 00:00:13] <Wave23212> No
[2023-01-03 00:00:15] <+wildrness> whose damage??? flats off the perc rn
[2023-01-03 00:00:16] <falconzitshigh> No
[2023-01-03 00:00:16] <+Keptic> all supports should be balanced around having a movement ability imo
[2023-01-03 00:00:16] <+Phrankren> I think healing and damage numbers need nerfs
[2023-01-03 00:00:17] <+Mreignsupreme> What breed of cat is that?
[2023-01-03 00:00:20] <%+Eragon_Cola> As long as all the tanks also get dmg down alongside dps it‚Äôd be ok
[2023-01-03 00:00:21] <picklev4> PIG IS FIRST PLS
[2023-01-03 00:00:21] <+MythMannz> I think the point the devs want to address is making supports more fun to play
[2023-01-03 00:00:22] <%SirTryhard7> SeemsGood
[2023-01-03 00:00:22] <1stplays> Mercy rework is a must
[2023-01-03 00:00:25] <%Nennai> !sully
[2023-01-03 00:00:25] <!%xx_m3m3_m4chine_420_69_xx> @Whatthecode :(
[2023-01-03 00:00:25] <@%^StreamElements> If you see a cute small creature causing chaos in the background, that's Emongg's bengal kitty Sully emongDesk
[2023-01-03 00:00:25] <hawks_sa> Bap > brig
[2023-01-03 00:00:27] <reenoxya> nessuno, i taugt same.. thats most prob for supp
[2023-01-03 00:00:28] <+SupportRipper> bring dmg and health down so like that heal would be more valuable
[2023-01-03 00:00:29] <%$janonymous> next two support i think
[2023-01-03 00:00:30] <%+ayeinsist> ana is slower than molasses in january, a mobility boost would be nice
[2023-01-03 00:00:30] <ItsKingSavageBabyy> moira can bounce her ball to heall around corners , she better than ana and brig
[2023-01-03 00:00:30] <rivimatt> support
[2023-01-03 00:00:31] <$hachigatsu08> Support next role
[2023-01-03 00:00:31] <!%Vent_YeahManThatsCool> maybe change role queue to have 1tank 3 dps adn 1 healer
[2023-01-03 00:00:31] <ArcaneLight> support
[2023-01-03 00:00:32] <morfanos> Buff support dmg, remove casting time and reduce cooldowns on abilities; it would break the game and I‚Äôd love it
[2023-01-03 00:00:32] <falconzitshigh> Mercy healing buff
[2023-01-03 00:00:33] <%+enreves> Surely they'll nerf Sojourn COPIUM
[2023-01-03 00:00:35] <%+yokeplex> support
[2023-01-03 00:00:36] <Audgeirr> being back 6v6
[2023-01-03 00:00:39] <+drifbloomin_onion> support iirc
[2023-01-03 00:00:39] <drewiez10> @1stplays W take she enables bad dps which cant be buffed
[2023-01-03 00:00:41] <%+enreves> New hero will be support
[2023-01-03 00:00:41] <LazyLapin> they just got kiriko lol.
[2023-01-03 00:00:44] <+TheGreatWargasm_> next two are support right?
[2023-01-03 00:00:44] <Drinks_TV> lower damage: shields get stronger, armor gets stronger, healing is oppressive, game gets slower
[2023-01-03 00:00:44] <kasper93> @LordDikusMaximus fair, still there are 3 supports in S tier, just make up your mind, either they are S tier and not.
[2023-01-03 00:00:49] <+ZefiTV> tanks are busted
[2023-01-03 00:00:49] <CoachableWorm> 6v6 waaaaaaaaay better
[2023-01-03 00:00:52] <reenoxya> a/s for bap
[2023-01-03 00:00:52] <morfanos> next 2 heroes are support no?
[2023-01-03 00:00:59] <DwDrums123> Hogs belly is probably so comfy
[2023-01-03 00:00:59] <MakeEmMone> I think people whine too much about character balance. Im a support main and there are a lot of ways to increase survivability
[2023-01-03 00:01:00] <%Culein_> i got banned in flats chat but cause i was bringing up the incident
[2023-01-03 00:01:01] <+O_T_K> @dodgydaniel shit I wish it was 1v1 I'd be rank 1 every season
[2023-01-03 00:01:08] <derzky_huerzky> BUT THE BAPTISTE IN S TIER FFS
[2023-01-03 00:01:10] <+arik0n_> what if supports get a modifier for increased incoming healing
[2023-01-03 00:01:15] <+SupportRipper> now support is not fun to play
[2023-01-03 00:01:15] <%+enreves> The incident monkaW
[2023-01-03 00:01:16] <Danval69> now support has insta queue
[2023-01-03 00:01:17] <$dodgydaniel> @O_T_K what rank are you right now
[2023-01-03 00:01:18] <thegargoyle7> Same im banned in his chat
[2023-01-03 00:01:19] <%Nennai> tankds not exploding on cd: players: "tanks are broken" jay3Chat
[2023-01-03 00:01:23] <+Hawk_I_Gaming> @Nessuno_00 what are you talking about? kiriko climbs and tele's, mercy flys, and lucio glides. support movement besides ana, and zen is fine. even brig has dash.
[2023-01-03 00:01:24] <!%xx_m3m3_m4chine_420_69_xx> @Culein_ are you insane, don't bring up the incident now
[2023-01-03 00:01:29] <jlcat0207> Probably Support Dps Support Tank

[2023-01-03 00:01:34] <%Culein_> mods are busy @xx_m3m3_m4chine_420_69_xx
[2023-01-03 00:01:35] <+Steph_You_Up> if you get banned in anyone's chat,  probably cause you were being an ass
[2023-01-03 00:01:36] <%Noeliosis> NODDERS
[2023-01-03 00:01:38] <+herpesfreesince3> "They tried to make tank more fun". and yet, Orisa exists, who literally doesn't even let you control your character when you fight her
[2023-01-03 00:01:39] <chasecagle> I wanna see emong play again

[2023-01-03 00:01:54] <%NoT2BaDTV> pepePoint
[2023-01-03 00:01:55] <+Rakatosu> what about added sub types to the class since they already have class buffs adding a sub type would buff/nerf combination of heros without ruining the heros base stats
[2023-01-03 00:01:59] <$dodgydaniel> imo i think they should buff heroes by changing their names like what they did to cassidy e.g. change ball's name to ethan @Emongg thoughts?

[2023-01-03 00:02:13] <Anameduh> I enjoy support a lot. but I'm only mid diamond.
[2023-01-03 00:02:14] <n0skun0ss0> support is mostly fine
[2023-01-03 00:02:16] <fn1o27> Bap either bottom a top b
[2023-01-03 00:02:18] <+wildrness> support is fine except zen
[2023-01-03 00:02:21] <+SupportRipper> fun to play support and get oneshot by every hero atm
[2023-01-03 00:02:21] <+ZefiTV> @xmmhunterz makes sojourn even better
[2023-01-03 00:02:23] <+Steph_You_Up> @xmmhunterz Sojourn is strong and Mercy can pocket
[2023-01-03 00:02:23] <derzky_huerzky> Brig is @$$
[2023-01-03 00:02:23] <+Belowavrge> Nah but it was always the less enjoyable role
[2023-01-03 00:02:24] <CoachableWorm> Sombra back at the bottom lmmffaaaooooo
[2023-01-03 00:02:25] <naughtyones> Mercy is S tier because Sojourn is S tier.. only reason
[2023-01-03 00:02:25] <%+Garrett_209> @xmmhunterz she enables sojourn
[2023-01-03 00:02:26] <%Nennai> HYPERSULLY
[2023-01-03 00:02:26] <1stplays> @xmmhunterz She makes high burst dps be able to oneshot and live forever
[2023-01-03 00:02:28] <%+enreves> @xmmhunterz Pocket Sojourn meta
[2023-01-03 00:02:29] <%simply_patti> SULLY!
[2023-01-03 00:02:30] <fl1ck_ttv> i love playing kiriko.. lucio.. moira
[2023-01-03 00:02:31] <stowc> @xmmhunterz tldr: giga mobility + enables one shots and shit
[2023-01-03 00:02:32] <%+omnideoist> @xmmhunterz sojurn needs damage boost to oneshot now and ashe is pretty good rn too
[2023-01-03 00:02:35] <%7thSea> Wait someone brought up the incident?
[2023-01-03 00:02:35] <srinu150> @xmmhunterz her movement and pocket is strong and goes well with most of the meta heros
[2023-01-03 00:02:37] <turtl3_dud3> i thinkm sully is mad
[2023-01-03 00:02:37] <+ATLDreams> Brig is not B tier
[2023-01-03 00:02:39] <+Belowavrge> Not that it‚Äôs weak‚Ä¶.but make it FUN
[2023-01-03 00:02:39] <cosimoinexile> are drops busted? I've been stuck at 65% progress all day
[2023-01-03 00:02:40] <%Noeliosis> MEOW
[2023-01-03 00:02:41] <xTookie_> I think support is fine but I need movement reworks
[2023-01-03 00:02:41] <MakeEmMone> If Zen is B tho Bap is Definitely A. Plays too well with Orisa and sigma to be anything less
[2023-01-03 00:02:42] <+anime257> :O

[2023-01-03 00:02:50] <drewiez10> if mercy did not exist people would not complain about soljurn
[2023-01-03 00:02:53] <+relytsey> Lucio and Kiriko should be S. Ana and Mercy in A.
[2023-01-03 00:02:53] <hategape> Lower damage and ruin the game so supports can low intensity heal more? Plz no.
[2023-01-03 00:02:58] <@%$Whatthecode> @7thSea emongLate
[2023-01-03 00:02:59] <drewiez10> Mercy is the only reason why Soljurn is still hated
[2023-01-03 00:03:00] <turtl3_dud3> MEOW
[2023-01-03 00:03:02] <hawks_sa> sully had enough of flats today
[2023-01-03 00:03:14] <ChipJiggins> Orisa is wicked fun
[2023-01-03 00:03:15] <1stplays> nah I think soj would still be strong without Mercy
[2023-01-03 00:03:18] <why_do_you_read_this> Is there any chance blizzard add mnk on console (only in pc pool without any restrictions)?
[2023-01-03 00:03:19] <+Pussifier> I miss old orisa
[2023-01-03 00:03:20] <%Nennai> @drewiez10 people were complaining about her before the pocket became a thing
[2023-01-03 00:03:21] <$dodgydaniel> change orisa's name to ethan, mega nerf
[2023-01-03 00:03:22] <%7thSea> CODE SUBprise
[2023-01-03 00:03:23] <+AmidstDemons> Any increase in mobility or damage makes support feel worse
[2023-01-03 00:03:25] <%DireDaniel> Sully got tired of discussion I guess
[2023-01-03 00:03:25] <+Xadiatul> Brigitte need work man

[2023-01-03 00:03:39] <+WolfieSau> leave the hook
[2023-01-03 00:03:41] <@%$Whatthecode> @7thSea Hope you've been well emongH
[2023-01-03 00:03:42] <morfanos> I went from support main to flex, playing support rn does not feel good. I‚Äôm playing hide and seek all game.
[2023-01-03 00:03:48] <+herpesfreesince3> @hategape Imo DPS does need to come down. BUT healing needs to come down as well. Less total sustain during middling parts of fights and then give Supports more CC to defend themselves. The game wouldn't be just "Kill supports to win", which is what makes playing the role so unfun

[2023-01-03 00:03:59] <%$kittykat_______> anyone know when we will find out the new brig ult?

[2023-01-03 00:04:02] <@%^StreamElements> If you're noticing ads at unfortunate times, Twitch now requires all streams to run ads at set intervals. We're not triggering them, they're on Twitch's end and out of our control.

[2023-01-03 00:04:16] <ire121> You guys should all get together and make a tierlist
[2023-01-03 00:04:17] <+BossyPie> shooting orisa for 4 weeks isn't too fun either though LUL
[2023-01-03 00:04:17] <xTookie_> that's an opinion but okay

[2023-01-03 00:04:20] <kasper93> ml7 would be goated to discuss
[2023-01-03 00:04:21] <%Nennai> D:
[2023-01-03 00:04:21] <BengalsFan4Lyf> this tier list is awful even by top 500 standards
[2023-01-03 00:04:22] <omgstepbrowhatareyoudoing> because this is tank bias
[2023-01-03 00:04:24] <ire121> No that's a very good idea
[2023-01-03 00:04:24] <%zonar_ow> flats really can't be saying that when he puts brig in B tier
[2023-01-03 00:04:26] <!%xx_m3m3_m4chine_420_69_xx> now flats is going to be banned from karq's chat :(

[2023-01-03 00:04:56] <hachigatsu08> @Emongg can you post this on Twitter so that I can refer to it later?
[2023-01-03 00:04:56] <MakeEmMone> Easy A for Bap
[2023-01-03 00:04:56] <morfanos> Karq ml7 kabaji seagull
[2023-01-03 00:05:00] <+ElbeeGaming> KarQ > Flats
[2023-01-03 00:05:02] <ire121> KarQ makes tierlists for average players
[2023-01-03 00:05:04] <1stplays> Yeah Bap is the most reliant solo queue healer
[2023-01-03 00:05:08] <+herpesfreesince3> @emongg The problem with support imo isn't that they're bad or unfun, it's that the games win conditions are "Kill supports". Combined with low team-work in most ranks makes playing the role horrible.
[2023-01-03 00:05:09] <srinu150> BAP is good. but kiriko rn feels like better BAP
[2023-01-03 00:05:22] <GRIMlTO> its great cause its instant
[2023-01-03 00:05:25] <Drinks_TV> The AOE self-burst heal is incredible
[2023-01-03 00:05:25] <turtl3_dud3> immortality feild is amazing
[2023-01-03 00:05:26] <keeerrrk> what is this tierlist?
[2023-01-03 00:05:26] <ire121> kiriko's way better than bap imo
[2023-01-03 00:05:29] <Audgeirr> junk rat.......no mechanical skill required
[2023-01-03 00:05:31] <+ElbeeGaming> @keeerrrk bad
[2023-01-03 00:05:33] <kasper93> @ire121 I think karq is farming content, he doesn't put much though nowadays
[2023-01-03 00:05:35] <%simply_patti> KarQ, ML7, Jay3 & Seagull tier list together! Please‚Ä¶after the patch tho lol
[2023-01-03 00:05:42] <+Drijeridoo> Bap AOE can save a bad turn in a team fight
[2023-01-03 00:05:42] <+kamorzy> Lol no way ana is S tier
[2023-01-03 00:05:42] <Jangefire> Heals more if you're under half hp too
[2023-01-03 00:05:43] <%Teiresias911> I definitely see the swiftmend in it
[2023-01-03 00:05:44] <derzky_huerzky> tier list needs a support point of view
[2023-01-03 00:05:45] <Erlopram> Baptise is the most boring hero to get on mystery heroes LUL
[2023-01-03 00:05:47] <cristianjg12> its heals for more its lower than hlaf hp
[2023-01-03 00:05:48] <$dodgydaniel> imo baptiste should be D tier because he doesnt have a free battletag name change available like what cassidy had
[2023-01-03 00:05:57] <+Steph_You_Up> Tbh if you have trouble climbing as support, Bap is one of the best to climb to Diamond then transition to Kiriko, that's when he kinda falls off
[2023-01-03 00:05:59] <kosmos442> gotta have a hot on target too i think
[2023-01-03 00:06:03] <+saltlesser> ?

[2023-01-03 00:06:21] <+Stadic777> bap shift is pretty impactful
[2023-01-03 00:06:25] <danzayemon> I think echo and Ana should swap
[2023-01-03 00:06:25] <xTookie_> lol
[2023-01-03 00:06:27] <%fuzzyama> it's huge
[2023-01-03 00:06:31] <Agentj007> Bap heals are good, his damage is good, lamp is a great ability and his ult can be terrifying

[2023-01-03 00:06:31] <Drinks_TV> This guy is making a tier list LUL
[2023-01-03 00:06:37] <omgstepbrowhatareyoudoing> tanks players dont know about support
[2023-01-03 00:06:49] <JawaFilms> just arrived what we doing
[2023-01-03 00:06:58] <derzky_huerzky> bap has a 75 damage also, dont forget it
[2023-01-03 00:06:58] <+Steph_You_Up> @omgstepbrowhatareyoudoing Werent they GM supports last season???
[2023-01-03 00:06:59] <naughtyones> Seeing as he put Brig as B tier.. yea tank players do not know about support ;)
[2023-01-03 00:06:59] <$dodgydaniel> where would you place /log in the tierlist?
[2023-01-03 00:06:59] <Sean_FPS_> Soldier and Bastion A tier?
[2023-01-03 00:07:04] <+kamorzy> I find Bap so clunky to play
[2023-01-03 00:07:05] <drewiez10> @JawaFilms bad tier list
[2023-01-03 00:07:05] <+Xadiatul> What is brigitte new ult
[2023-01-03 00:07:14] <omgstepbrowhatareyoudoing> @Steph_You_Up dont think so
[2023-01-03 00:07:16] <Krylphi> Tanks takes on Supports are fine KEKW
[2023-01-03 00:07:19] <curndump> Baps mobility makes him dangerous
[2023-01-03 00:07:20] <+AmidstDemons> Bap can take over for Soldier when needed lol
[2023-01-03 00:07:20] <morfanos> Bap gun is so much fun
[2023-01-03 00:07:25] <chadinbrackets> symmetra is just annoying
[2023-01-03 00:07:28] <UltraWindow> i've seen a bap carry, they are scary
[2023-01-03 00:07:29] <%simply_patti> Bap dmg is fun to dish out!
[2023-01-03 00:07:29] <%+FuturaMajora> why do healers need help but they're all in the top half of the list?
[2023-01-03 00:07:32] <hawks_sa> this tier list is probably a few weeks ahead of its time
[2023-01-03 00:07:34] <vicinq> how is Cassidy C tier?

[2023-01-03 00:07:44] <+mines_ow> @Emongg as a ball main who has hit top 500 dont u think its weird to put him at D. He has such a high skill ceiling that if ur good with him u can still find value. i missed that part of ur tierlist so if u can shed some light on it i would appreciate it

[2023-01-03 00:31:05] <%naultz24> Widow ruins any sort of enjoyment, fun, or happiness that exists for this game. It‚Äôs a pity this game is held back by such dogsht like widowmaker. What‚Äôs that? Go a dive hero to counter? She just grapples out of everything. What an absolute garbage can. Can one shot from across the map, slim hitbox, and can literally yeet herself.

[2023-01-03 00:38:19] <turtl3_dud3> so i had a small brain storm about junker queen, and how to fix her kit. and i wanted to share my ideas. 1) add her life steal to her primary fire. 2) make her lifesteal still activate through overkill damage. 3) make the anti from her ult not be able to be cleansed. now im not say they should do those but i think any of those changes could help. @Emongg

[2023-01-03 01:32:47] <omegapoint2> in europe the most comparable thing i think is just "sour cream and onion" flavor which is sort of widely spread i believe
[2023-01-03 01:32:49] <+zakxtbi1> @SuikaOW2 no its like buttermilk and spices and stuff

[2023-01-03 15:49:51] <%eagleflight06> Correct
[2023-01-03 15:49:53] <weeesd3> She needs ANY sort of  utility other than just healng which is worse than any other support other than mercy.

[2023-01-03 15:51:08] <+ayoCruciaL> i agree!

[2023-01-03 15:51:18] <SteroOO> best way to shot the healing orb at the ceiling to bounce back and forth
[2023-01-03 15:51:25] <gravity1992> Reinhardt needs some buffs tbh. Like make it so that he has a cooldown where he is extra tanky
[2023-01-03 15:51:25] <allenboyhs> suppp strimmer
[2023-01-03 15:51:33] <darkgloomir> healing orb near enemies should force them to rave out

[2023-01-03 15:51:48] <%TheNastyFridge> @LeWitcher That sounds like a unique hero design that we totally don't already have in the game NODDERS
[2023-01-03 15:51:49] <LunarEclipse1996> i remember in ow1 theres a experimental version moira orb can stick on player lol
[2023-01-03 15:51:50] <+ykk_zipper_co> As a player returning from S1/S2 OW1... Moira's healing seems iffy in Silver. She has high total healing in games, but not a ton of impactful healing, if that makes sense. Not sure how or why though.
[2023-01-03 15:51:53] <%$uncljed> Give Moira 69hp and a dream
[2023-01-03 15:51:57] <Boom_america> This is the best ow stream by far <3
[2023-01-03 15:51:58] <gravity1992> Bring back the 100dmg firestrikeeee
[2023-01-03 15:51:58] <+prized_1> healing orb should orbit target
[2023-01-03 15:51:59] <DoormanOW> Right but Moira is support so 600 hp is more balanced
[2023-01-03 15:52:01] <weeesd3> @weeesd3 I mean healing output needs an orb which is a cooldown and on that other supports have better cooldowns

[2023-01-03 15:52:46] <%Kawazoey> give moira 600 hp and 300 shield
[2023-01-03 15:52:54] <+zombiesgosplat> burst heals come from her orbs and spray at the same time
[2023-01-03 15:53:01] <awashsissors1> it kinda has to be aggressive since she has to be closer to the enemy to do damage and refill her heal
[2023-01-03 15:53:03] <%AverageJonas> Oh my god why am I awake
[2023-01-03 15:53:03] <+prized_1> Moira really cant save people like bap/ana
[2023-01-03 15:53:07] <%shavus88> (at least in the lower ranks) I really like playing moira behind a flank hero like tracer/reaper. Tossing a heal orb on a flanker helps them so much

[2023-01-03 15:54:32] <Sir_Wolvesbane> @larryevans3 Probably mid season
[2023-01-03 15:54:49] <herewegoagainbby> meters :O
[2023-01-03 15:54:53] <%eagleflight06> I try to play Moira only when I know my other support has strong burst e.g. Ana or bap
[2023-01-03 15:54:59] <%AverageJonas> Meters! What a gigachad
[2023-01-03 15:55:00] <+ykk_zipper_co> That explains why playing with a Moira (as a Kiriko) often feels like solo healing in team fights. In silver I never see healing orbs, only damage orbs.
[2023-01-03 15:55:01] <floweeaboo> pre patch kirko ult and moira orb was mad funny
[2023-01-03 15:55:07] <+fonttypeaaa> The best thing is throwing a damage orb after someone low and watching them die without having to chase

[2023-01-03 15:57:07] <Sir_Wolvesbane> @gravity1992 I assume it's the same if he's hitting all three bullets for body shot, where as Ashe can do it in one bullet

[2023-01-03 17:30:31] <%iliketoeatpineapples> @trumpcardd use rock when she's DM - ing or trying to dive your backline. use his shift ability if she's dishing out her missiles
[2023-01-03 17:30:31] <WabbitInvictus> @trumpcardd Well yeah she is a counter to him as she's a dive character, but you should aim to bait out her matrix and play around your shield. If possible just try to predict when she's going to predict you since she's a very wide target you can easily hit her.

[2023-01-03 17:47:05] <@%^StreamElements> TooManySnipers, Emongg's ult is on numpad4 because he plays with arrow keys. He does not play left handed. The reason the other abilities say E and Shift is because they are double bound.

[2023-01-03 17:51:00] <%shavus88> Honestly, just make it "play 5 games" instead of "win 5 games" and it's a much better quest

[2023-01-03 17:51:04] <%stillarobyn> yeah, arcade wins are also just...harder to get because people just memeing in the arcade
