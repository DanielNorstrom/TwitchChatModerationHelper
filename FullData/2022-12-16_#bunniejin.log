[2022-12-16 10:28:07] <!%Steffen7> there are many Indian curries
[2022-12-16 10:28:17] <@%Casedy> this is southern indian style of curry
[2022-12-16 10:28:34] <@%Casedy> butter chicken etc is from northern india
[2022-12-16 10:28:53] <!%Steffen7> it's really there specialty to make the best curries
[2022-12-16 10:29:04] <@%Casedy> yeah but in Malaysia we dont call it prata. We call it roti canai
[2022-12-16 10:29:21] <%newbie_2021> actually most of Indian eateries in malaysia are based on southern India

[2022-12-16 10:30:11] <%greatbattles> there are different types like tosai, capathi etc etc
[2022-12-16 10:30:38] <gasparovtwelve> yeah
[2022-12-16 10:30:39] <@%Casedy> to me, as a person who loves curry, i think the chicken curry is the best one
[2022-12-16 10:30:41] <!%Steffen7> best curry in the world you could say actually
[2022-12-16 10:30:41] <%greatbattles> for me, kayu has better roti + curry

[2022-12-16 10:49:58] <@%Casedy> they usually cook the curry in a huge batch in a pot. So usually when u ask for the curry, they just take the curry alone from that pot
[2022-12-16 10:49:59] <pexdas> nice
