[2022-12-10 18:53:43] <forsencd_76> hi mr. Viss. your christmas-tree looks like the DOC MyAvatar 🏆
[2022-12-10 18:53:47] <+JimbleSaurusRex> holy shit, the helo play lol
[2022-12-10 18:54:03] <+RedMageCecil> it's short and runs like crap on PC
[2022-12-10 18:54:12] <+Th3Pre4ch3r> Dude. It's very good. Especially now. The stuttering is so minimal. It's a good game.
[2022-12-10 18:54:17] <+notoriouseze> @jimblesaurusrex it’s not for everyone but I enjoyed it.
[2022-12-10 18:54:20] <Athanatossa> It's a fine playthrough. It's SUPER short so not worth full price, but for a single run it's fine. They patched how it runs
[2022-12-10 18:54:23] <+JimbleSaurusRex> it's good if you like Dead Space that runs like shit
[2022-12-10 18:54:24] VIEWERS: 832
[2022-12-10 18:54:28] <%+MilliNation_> It gets a bit cheesy at the end but I give it an 8 out of 10.  They did a great job on the levels design
[2022-12-10 18:54:28] <%+seiba_alter> They patch the performance but the melee combat is booty and game is meh at best
[2022-12-10 18:54:38] <%+MilliNation_> every room is deifferent
[2022-12-10 18:55:04] <%+corona_killaa> do you have commands for your builds?
[2022-12-10 18:55:08] <%+corona_killaa> !fennec
[2022-12-10 18:55:09] <+RedMageCecil> I'd say it's a very solid "buy on sale" game
[2022-12-10 18:55:12] <%HeWhoFightsMonsters> Yeah, it's like they said let's remake dead space but make everything worse
[2022-12-10 18:55:20] <Athanatossa> The combat does get real same-y real quick. But the vibe is cool, and story is fine and it is 100% worth 1 playthrough. Only takes 5ish hours
[2022-12-10 18:55:25] <+RedMageCecil> I'm turbohyped for Dead Space remake tho
[2022-12-10 18:55:26] <+notoriouseze> I never had any problems with how it ran
[2022-12-10 18:55:57] <%Leoslice> Mistakes were made
[2022-12-10 18:56:07] <Athanatossa> Now it's a puzzle game
[2022-12-10 18:56:11] <Aeropulsioner> can you parachute from that building?
[2022-12-10 18:56:17] <minnideathgod> Should be able to climb up the truck that’s underneath it
[2022-12-10 18:56:18] <icrit_> LUL
[2022-12-10 18:56:19] <%+MilliNation_> Yeah they just need to re-work the fighting mechanics a bit make it about 20-25 hours long for the sequel. But I liked it.

[2022-12-10 18:56:35] <BO551980> @tsm_viss you always find the best solo strat here it is right here the helo strat
[2022-12-10 18:57:06] <+RedMageCecil> PC had massive shader load-in on first run through, it wrecked any immersion I had for it. I'm glad they patched it but it still soured my first play through
[2022-12-10 18:57:13] <%+MilliNation_> every single player game doesn't have to be a 100hours elden ring game
[2022-12-10 18:57:30] <icrit_> haha my man
[2022-12-10 18:57:35] <%+Sohotti> let's go

[2022-12-10 18:57:48] <+JimbleSaurusRex> @MilliNation_ yes but they shouldn't be terrible PC ports
[2022-12-10 18:57:49] <%+seiba_alter> @MilliNation_ Not saying it should be, but 5 hours is pretty meh
[2022-12-10 18:58:07] <%+seiba_alter> And that ^

[2022-12-10 18:58:34] <%+seiba_alter> Tired of PC game being bare minimum when it comes to performance
[2022-12-10 18:58:40] <minnideathgod> I think they should add repair kits for damaged vehicles in here.
[2022-12-10 18:58:52] <%+MilliNation_> @JimbleSaurusRex there were a few hiccups  on my end but it was fine most of the playthrough. And I have a mid-end pc nowhere near a high end.
[2022-12-10 18:58:54] <%+seiba_alter> Looking at your SquareEnix and your BS PC ports ):<

[2022-12-10 20:41:16] <plictisit> @Dangerdune the best cpu at the moment is the 5800x3d, you don't even need to bother with overclocking cuz u can't (something u need to do on intel cpus)
[2022-12-10 20:41:36] <Ninj4doggy> @dangerdune and u can't build a pc for the next couple years man... it's a fact right now.. just look at the statistics how unreal Engine gonna change the game world in just next couple of months
[2022-12-10 20:41:52] <Zaheero> air strike him Kappa
[2022-12-10 20:41:53] <%JaekuTV> @Dangerdune Either one is good tbh both will last. BUT consider if you get an AM5 board, thats going to be long lasting for the next gen AMD processors and you can always upgrade opposed to intel always switching their CPU sockets.
[2022-12-10 20:42:38] <Ninj4doggy> and just look at the warzone2 right now... even after using 4090 u hardly get 240 fps... by that u can just make up they is no future pc build right now
[2022-12-10 20:42:41] <sundo> yeah tbh amd cpus have been killing it the last few years, id go amd for sure

[2022-12-10 20:49:24] <Dangerdune> I have had The i5-9600k since launch, so it’s time to change.
[2022-12-10 20:50:32] <%JaekuTV> @Dangerdune those are good, id even look at a x670E plus. $200-$300 range is good.
