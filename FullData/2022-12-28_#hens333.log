[2022-12-28 16:29:45] <MrFrappa> With all due respect. I always take streaks with a grain of salt. Imo a streak will only last long enough until you face off against a comp squad KEKW
[2022-12-28 16:29:51] <Silnent> I know people that play dbd mobile just to do impossible skill check doc
[2022-12-28 16:29:54] <%Tollerwolf> i mean it feels bad if someone is just playing casually and is put up against someone who tryhards doing a streak so I would understand being upset there when you want to chill and the other side is here to sweat. Thats unfortunate
[2022-12-28 16:30:02] <+killua_121> @Hens333 do you think a ranked and unranked mode whould help the game or not? I'm not sure about this and want to know what you think about it

[2022-12-28 16:31:49] <+killua_121> @killua_121 Idk thats why i ask. The thing is maybe it whould  make the game more sweaty but rn all tryhards are in the same pools witht the no mither group
[2022-12-28 16:31:59] <Silnent> @ipwnmost I‚Äôve been playing the game for like 3 months because I couldn‚Äôt play on my console, it‚Äôs actually pretty alright with friends or as killer. The performance is poor but you can enjoy it a lot if u allow the game to be enjoyable

[2022-12-28 17:47:46] <detectiveshirogane> Well to be fair in most other games people base opinions on balance on the top players, too. The problem is that DBD is just way too different of a game to be able to do that
[2022-12-28 17:47:50] <ace0333> I just wanted your opinion they‚Äôre a lot of streamers who think dbd is surv sided and I disagree

[2022-12-28 17:51:14] <firelustva> Yeah, the aim is to throw them into deadzones, since they gain no distance off throws
[2022-12-28 17:51:23] <%+HansGetTheFLammenwerfer> killer dc also gives adept so this is the 3rd way to escape
[2022-12-28 17:51:26] <%TheKatWithABat> It might give a bit more use on Wesker than Clown but it's still a comfort perk if anything
[2022-12-28 17:51:26] <+benji_8080> can wesker still grab people out of the hatch animation?
[2022-12-28 17:51:27] <FrostWalk3r_> why is surv adept so much easier than killer smh

[2022-12-28 17:55:24] <MarshAlpaca> I remember hearing, I think it was Vel, talking about if there were proximity chat in DbD.  Basically if you play Billy and just put on Raining Blood and if you're playing survivor you just hear this loud thrasher metal getting closer at an alarming rate, and I haven't stopped thinking about it since.

[2022-12-28 18:38:10] <babyjuice20> i just get so sad that my teammates in solo q die in 15 seconds and the survivors i face as killer are usually very experienced while im not even that good with killer
[2022-12-28 18:38:11] <$greyglacier> dc almost always end in a collapse tho, so I think excluding dcs make sense
