But all my games are 1 sided stomps and ive even gotten Master dps players on my and enemy team. Wich results in very unfun games when is blizzard going to fix this. at the moment im having more fun in quick play then in ranked as the games feel alot more balanced in QP.

[2022-12-24 00:21:33] <%AnAbsoluteUnlt> @IrZKuma Ik, but another problem with matchmaking is climbing, since you keep your previous mmr from last season, but then drop a rank, so it is much harder to climb
[2022-12-24 00:21:34] <%+bluberryninja> @owgrandma @sofishdekat I also thank every single support player in advance for taking the time out of their day to heal us. Because I know it‚Äôs rough out there x-x

[2022-12-24 00:21:54] <%IrZKuma> @Nersicah just the way teams are matched together for games being really imbalanced with regard to the highest and lowest ranked players in the matches

[2022-12-24 00:33:44] <%djzander_> @a7xbulletslayer not trying to be mean but get a new duo partner if someone can‚Äôt handle dying might be time to find someone else
[2022-12-24 00:33:47] <tipsy_emu> if i don't play comp is it okay if i trihard in qp?
[2022-12-24 00:33:49] <!%OWGrandma> @chompchomp8 Nah it's actually wild, as high Diamond sometimes I'm getting Masters/GM games and sometimes I'm getting Plats who were gold last season KEKW
[2022-12-24 00:33:56] <%beagle_ow> My mmr is like Masters 3 ish and I played four consecutive GM/T500 lobbies he other day
[2022-12-24 00:34:03] <MEMENTOMORI_X> Like no one really plays it seriously only qp is the comp game mode and it‚Äôs embarrassing
[2022-12-24 00:34:09] <!%OWGrandma> The mixed matchmaking wouldn't be so bad if they matched per role or something

[2022-12-24 00:34:15] <%+bluberryninja> @ndulmage I mean I get diamond and masters in my ranked games and qp games sometimes. The matchmaking in this game is god awful sometimes lol

[2022-12-24 00:34:37] <DeciusCorvinus> @OWGrandma isn't that what their ranked system blog post said they are going to do
[2022-12-24 00:34:39] <%Kelocena> they claim that both teams will have the same spread of ranks but who knows if thats true
[2022-12-24 00:34:46] <!%OWGrandma> QP being mixed doesn't bug me at all, it's fun sometimes to go up against harder opponents for me
[2022-12-24 00:34:49] <%+bluberryninja> @mementomori_x is that what we call try hards in quickplay?
[2022-12-24 00:34:52] <@%chompchomp8> @OWGrandma yeah diamond kinda straddles both sides of the ladder so it can get wacky kekDog
[2022-12-24 00:34:52] <%$jasonwocky> leaving you at the 197 damage breakpoint :P
[2022-12-24 00:35:00] <!%OWGrandma> @DeciusCorvinus YES! Not until S3 but I really hope they do

[2022-12-24 00:35:17] <%+bluberryninja> @chompchomp8 wait I thought it was plat :0
[2022-12-24 00:35:24] <%FireBadLuck> If what they say about the change in matchmaking is true, I'm a bit excited. As a QP warrior, it's nice to know my silver dps gameplay is accompany by an enemy silver gameplay
[2022-12-24 00:35:26] <%djzander_> @lokstar3110 no it‚Äôs only damage
[2022-12-24 00:35:30] <%+A7XBulletSlayer> @djzander_ honestly I've considered solo queueing so I can get out of Bronze. I feel held back when he gets tilted, but I've played with this dude for over 15 years, it would be a dick move to leave him behind
[2022-12-24 00:35:32] <%ow_sigmaeats> @lokstar3110 no just damage
[2022-12-24 00:35:34] <maxdarner567> @OWGrandma THIS omg, high tank elo spread is soo much more detrimental to the game than dps or support
[2022-12-24 00:35:39] <ogkushkilla02> No the matching is awful. I have no idea where I am rn as a brand new player, where I placed is not the games I‚Äôm getting and my rank doesn‚Äôt reflect it at all honestly rlly big L

[2022-12-24 00:35:48] <%kisa_was_taken> @OWGrandma I like going up against higher evel players too because I can try and learn what they do...but getting steamrolled to the point where I can't even study them isn't fun
[2022-12-24 00:35:50] <+ticklishboy> if you and FroggerOW 1v1'd who do you think would win? @Flats
[2022-12-24 00:35:55] <@%chompchomp8> @bluberryninja well i mean plat is technically halfway in pure sr but theres so little people in masters/gm that it will pull from high diamond
[2022-12-24 00:36:01] <lokstar3110> cool thank guys
[2022-12-24 00:36:02] <%+tiberius_moon> @NDulmage I had to wait for the MMR shift so it takes me less matches to climb back to the rank I left off of in Season 1. No comp for 10 days, then after I got back the games felt hopeless as support, the stuff that worked in plat last season just wasn't working in S2.
[2022-12-24 00:36:04] <%+bluberryninja> @owgrandma if I ever climb high enough to masters and diamond and I‚Äôm in your game, can you give me a warm diamond/masters welcome? :)

[2022-12-24 00:36:27] <!%OWGrandma> @maxdarner567 Yeahhh like if we get a plat tank vs a high Diamond tank but they have a plat DPS or support it's pretty much GG for us

[2022-12-24 00:36:58] <%djzander_> @a7xbulletslayer i get that, but sometimes if they‚Äôre holding you back or making you tilted it‚Äôs best to stick to only qp with them

[2022-12-24 00:38:27] <+Richter_Kade> That's the beauty of Widow. Low damage because your damage is generally removing them. Long as the threat is there and you're in their head you have value without even shooting.

[2022-12-24 01:02:41] <%IrZKuma> @Rivgane i mean theres only so much i can type in 1 twitch comment. there is more to it obvs, but what im saying is that its just 2 cycles, it will go up when they play more. also we dont know the losses to that so if they got 7-2 like you they likely would have went up. if they did get that and not rank up there is something else at work

[2022-12-24 01:07:46] <%IrZKuma> @Rivgane no i mean more losses than average to get the 7 wins and maybe have bad personal performance in those games and so it doesnt give them as much credit as it would if they done better personally in the games. theres a ton of variables that can account for it with just 2 cycles. if it was like 4+ cycles then it would be really weird

[2022-12-24 01:10:15] <%IrZKuma> @OWGrandma it doesnt make a big difference, but unless its really different from before then it matters slightly. and so if you have a loss but also do bad it would hurt you more than if you lost but done quite well. both still gonna hurt cos of the loss but the personal performance used to have a small impact too

[2022-12-24 01:13:18] <%IrZKuma> @OWGrandma ill take your word for it then, but either way the losses still matter and i was asking about how many losses they had per 7 wins cos they didnt say. and also previous season rank wasnt said so could be that they have had some unfortunate winrates and starting mmr for the season
[2022-12-24 01:13:19] <woozywiz> So like 1 1/2 months

[2022-12-24 01:44:17] <MAZCAM10> @GL_Outlast thats incorrect, they are enabling the team for pickls and pushes which actually is more than dps specifically, dps get early or late picks helping teams win fights

[2022-12-24 01:44:35] <GL_Outlast> @GL_Outlast It depends a lot on the hero played, but a mercy player cannot be compared to a genji for example

[2022-12-24 22:14:49] <+softlore> small talk sucks and takes too long to build a meaningful conversation with strangers

[2022-12-24 22:15:30] <brayan7979> @talon824 I remember OW1. And while I did like GOATS, what may or may not make my opinion biased. Brig doesn't need a new ultimate. Just lower the cost of Rally, a bit more HP on herself and her shield, and I feel she would be golden.
[2022-12-24 22:15:33] <%Ocara115> @NightSpinner_ nice backpedal when the mod replied

[2022-12-24 22:15:44] <sir_akahito> I feel like most people that claim to be introverts really aren‚Äôt. I find most people actually want to/enjoy going out of their way to build social connections, but don‚Äôt have the social skills to do so.
[2022-12-24 22:15:47] <ohweather> do you knoow who warn is?

[2022-12-24 22:40:49] <talon824> @quickburn619 Probably Orisa. She can land the spear then some follow up shots
[2022-12-24 22:41:04] <%+cool_lad_stephen> they should make firestrike do 700 damage specifically to roadhog
[2022-12-24 22:41:26] <%$TankMittens> ^
[2022-12-24 22:41:34] <talon824> @cool_lad_stephen Firestrike ignites his take a breather canister. Makes sense
[2022-12-24 22:41:36] <Fireblown> you should get SELF DMG when missing a hook with hog, atleast 500 KEKW
[2022-12-24 22:41:44] <+JimmyGoneTwitch1> flats just started watching you like last month and have binged loads of vids, and i‚Äôm just starting to watch the streams merry christmas and good luck for the new year

[2022-12-24 22:44:55] <%+BigNaCl> @poptartdragons doomfist punch him away from your team and watch his ult turn off
[2022-12-24 22:44:55] <%ow_sigmaeats> @flats I got an idea on how to nerf hog, every time you miss a hook the cooldown is increased by 5 seconds
[2022-12-24 22:45:00] <monkey_tomodachi> Happy Holidays Flats and Chat  peepoHappy stay safe

[2022-12-24 22:45:32] <%SkitzoCTRL> @poptartdragons Ana can just sleep him. Orisa is a decent counter. Kiriko and Zen are pretty good, too.
[2022-12-24 22:45:37] <%AlienJoe> @Flats If you make Sloppy Joes with venison, is it still a Joe thats sloppy, or is it something like Sloppy Cletus?
[2022-12-24 22:45:37] <zee_dude_30> How do u counter a good doom on tank
