[2022-12-11 10:55:43] <%Aduriz666> Hello
[2022-12-11 10:56:03] <!%joshibet06> I know how it feels when your nation gets robbed
[2022-12-11 10:56:05] <+liam281991> i can see Croatia troubling Argentina a lot with their physicality
[2022-12-11 10:56:05] <nuriddin99> do you think that Sake should have taken the second pen?
[2022-12-11 10:56:06] <%+iancurr57> Deeelicious tears 😂😂😂😂
[2022-12-11 10:56:11] <%+th3antman> never a foul, saka goes down to easy. the foul on kane is outside the box so var can't intervene to check penalty. you got 2 other penalties.
[2022-12-11 10:56:14] <@%FUTWIZ_NiKSNEB> we had wtm for france tho lets be honest
[2022-12-11 10:56:23] <+21irst> any recommendations for a good CAM, got about 800k?
[2022-12-11 10:56:25] <ziadhisham288> Facts ^^
[2022-12-11 10:56:30] <TheABL> yo yo hope ya good bro f france
[2022-12-11 10:56:36] <nuriddin99> yeah 100% a foul
[2022-12-11 10:56:37] <%rygn922> Harry Kane tried his best, cant blame him
[2022-12-11 10:56:40] <lucas33305> I dont think ref wasnt that bad
[2022-12-11 10:56:49] <+32bitskit> he wouldve drilled the 2nd one if lloris wasnt in net
[2022-12-11 10:56:50] <%Vic2Shiesty_KDB17> blame kane
[2022-12-11 10:56:50] <legalcookie_> unbalanced saka for goal. took his standing leg away
[2022-12-11 10:56:53] <%Vic2Shiesty_KDB17> that fraud

[2022-12-11 10:57:04] <sorb90> We did get two pens, if we didn’t have the pens we might kit have scored
[2022-12-11 10:57:06] <@%FUTWIZ_NiKSNEB> unless people are trolling
[2022-12-11 10:57:09] <yo_pieerree> Saka destroyed Theo Hernandez
[2022-12-11 10:57:11] <samafca123> Lahoz was worse, you guys were Lucky
[2022-12-11 10:57:11] <nuriddin99> But thats how France play , they get 2 or 3 good chances and score them
[2022-12-11 10:57:11] <%+th3antman> Lloris got in Kanes head. he made an early move to the same side and Kane changed his mind during run up.
[2022-12-11 10:57:16] <%rygn922> That Mbappe acceleration against walker is insane
[2022-12-11 10:57:17] <+21irst> it was going to take something special to beat france but man they was not good overall
[2022-12-11 10:57:21] <!%+acluvsufan> Southgate leaving one of the best passers itw on the bench if I speak
[2022-12-11 10:57:25] <@%FUTWIZ_NiKSNEB> 'ref wasnt that bad'
[2022-12-11 10:57:28] <fordykyle1> we cant be relying on pens to win
[2022-12-11 10:57:35] <%+iancurr57> Saka was the best player on the pitch and he took him off
[2022-12-11 10:57:46] <!%joshibet06> @hashtag_stokes why does everyone just doesn’t shoot middle? GK always dives
[2022-12-11 10:57:51] <+jeffrey21218> Yeah 1 v1 he outrun walker stokes
[2022-12-11 10:57:57] <!%+acluvsufan> We need a goal and leave Trent on the bench
[2022-12-11 10:57:57] <%+daada_sk> Upamecano no too good at defender
[2022-12-11 10:58:00] <!%+acluvsufan> 😃
[2022-12-11 10:58:02] <Dhammillama> The ref literally didn’t give the 2nd penalty. Only because the treachery was caught in HD was it given
[2022-12-11 10:58:05] <@dan_x10> The ref had the perfect game they planned
[2022-12-11 10:58:06] <%+iam_echo> hi tom
[2022-12-11 10:58:06] <%+th3antman> Could have been worse. you could have had the Argentina ref 😀😀

[2022-12-11 10:58:32] <+liam281991> ref was bad but that first goal was on us, we had plenty of chance to stop them

[2022-12-11 10:58:39] <nuriddin99> Kane had a very good game as well
[2022-12-11 10:58:39] <landeskog> England really struggle to score in open play
[2022-12-11 10:58:44] <samafca123> How Paredes didnt get a ref still amazes me
[2022-12-11 10:58:45] <%+th3antman> Had him a few times for Rangers games last couple of seasons. he's fucking murder
[2022-12-11 10:58:46] <francisxm> you see Paddy Pimblett get a gifted decision?
[2022-12-11 10:58:46] <!%joshibet06> Trent 💀
[2022-12-11 10:58:59] <TheABL> Morocco ftw
[2022-12-11 10:59:06] <yo_pieerree> All he did was give a lot of yellow I don’t remember him making a wrong decision
[2022-12-11 10:59:11] <fordykyle1> me too
[2022-12-11 10:59:18] <hjcoates> @francisxm he won round 1 and 3
[2022-12-11 10:59:18] <%Vic2Shiesty_KDB17> what's so hard about trying Trent in the midfield he can't defend anyways doesn't hurt experiment or am I dumb thinking that be honest
[2022-12-11 10:59:25] <capitainharrymaguire> We played one of the best game yesterday the ref was so shit
[2022-12-11 10:59:32] <plutodrip777> paddy was so shit

[2022-12-11 11:01:11] <ziadhisham288> Saliba is better than konate, Konate cant pass the ball
[2022-12-11 11:01:11] <%+th3antman> He chopped of a Ryan Kent goal against Borussia Dortmund.  Morelos wins the ball, plays in Kent and Kent scores. referee gave a foul against Morelos for Hummels volleying the back of Morelos leg. its one of the worst decisions I've ever seen
[2022-12-11 11:01:13] <TLOTOOLE> That Upa is shite
[2022-12-11 11:01:15] <%+nicorocq> konate is more comfortable in the french selection than saliba

[2022-12-11 11:01:55] <TLOTOOLE> Konate is much better than Saliba that Saliba is slow to turn
[2022-12-11 11:01:56] <%+th3antman> Amrabat has to be in TOTT
[2022-12-11 11:01:58] <lucas33305> Mbappe not in TOTT? He got a card a week ago
[2022-12-11 11:01:58] <killafragzilla> England had 16 shots, 8 on target. Should of done more
[2022-12-11 11:01:58] <+Cxmmmy> that ref was so bad in that dortmund rangers game

[2022-12-11 11:02:44] <%+iancurr57> I’ve got 100 quid on Mbappe at 12’s and realistically only Messi can overtake him
[2022-12-11 11:02:49] <fordykyle1> the store pack at 200k is a joke for a token

[2022-12-11 11:04:09] <+GTheJanitor> The xG thing is irritating when that’s what people use for why a team should’ve won or not, England had a few shots on target but 3 were practically pass backs. Plenty talking points including the ref but France took their chances well and England didn’t at the end of it

[2022-12-11 11:43:38] <+21irst> rashford only getting 10 mins
[2022-12-11 11:43:39] <%+griff10_> Bottled the subs, bad changes and took too long to make them. Should have killed the game off when on top
[2022-12-11 11:43:40] <IneedKappaccino> this is how france became wc champion in 2018. just defend and be efficient
[2022-12-11 11:43:49] <arnold_od18> I would of said potter would be perfect for England before he went Chelsea
[2022-12-11 11:43:49] <%+waaweynka> Rashford on early
[2022-12-11 11:43:50] <omrshake> Lets not forget you man had Sven and Hodgson Southgates a blessing in comparison
[2022-12-11 11:43:53] <arnold_od18> Now I’m not sure
[2022-12-11 11:43:54] <calhub> We didn't go for it enough though, france were off it so needed to capitalise
[2022-12-11 11:43:59] <%+cel_95> i got gold CR7, wc hero Robbie Keane, wc hero smolarek, and baby eto'o untradeables. What do you think is the best striker pairing out of the bunch?
[2022-12-11 11:43:59] <treckerxd> best full back on fifa 23
[2022-12-11 11:44:04] <%leedevitt> Sterling 1st sub questionable
[2022-12-11 11:44:05] <%+waaweynka> would've missed them too 🤣🤣
[2022-12-11 11:44:13] <arnold_od18> Subs wise rashford should of been on early and foden moved into attacking midfield with Henderson out
[2022-12-11 11:44:17] <+ZaidFreestyle> PTG nkunku or WC zidane?
[2022-12-11 11:44:19] <+AEG_freddo> Griezmann & Giroud great duo that's all it is

[2022-12-11 11:44:30] <%Vic2Shiesty_KDB17> use ur 3 pauses on him
[2022-12-11 11:44:30] <+hatymz> hendo was class though
[2022-12-11 11:44:37] <+21irst> foden did nothing should've been off earlier
[2022-12-11 11:44:47] <drunk_papy> england still should have put a goal in the game

[2022-12-11 11:47:52] <+StealthFatal> then everyone would say why wouldnt you give it to Kane
[2022-12-11 11:47:52] <Neshfox> better players have missed pens in the past
[2022-12-11 11:47:53] <pylori1> say we gave it to rashford, there'd be racists out the woodwork fast
[2022-12-11 11:47:59] <+hatymz> harry 10/10 times

[2022-12-11 11:48:08] <greertops> spurs bottle merchant. he doesn't know what winning is
[2022-12-11 11:48:08] <+bladzf> Yeah but 2 pens in one game is always weird

[2022-12-11 11:48:17] <TheJammo19> I thought the ref was shocking, some of his decisions were laughable

[2022-12-11 11:48:51] <+Cxmmmy> plus he would have been england’s top goal scorer
[2022-12-11 11:48:51] <+frazmo_> He’s tried to hit it harder cause he more than likely knows lloris is going same way and he’s missed, it happens

[2022-12-11 12:06:07] <reedyrobin9> Same things happened with Sancho and Rashford after the euros 2020

[2022-12-11 12:07:07] <XBL_Rofl> I think Kane and Rashford tried to be too perfect with their set pieces, we were so unlucky to not win against france but also lucky a few of their best players were injured

[2022-12-11 12:10:45] <%Petrodoggz> presumably walker and shaw have to move aside?
[2022-12-11 12:10:46] <coys600> walker had a solid game
[2022-12-11 12:10:50] <%+topshelfmari0> Since it went between Jude’s legs as well
[2022-12-11 12:10:51] <Ramtin2k> tbf France didn't have arguably 3 of their best players

[2022-12-11 12:16:59] <%+polskamg> Saka plays for Arsenal. Arsenal players don't know what winning is.
[2022-12-11 12:17:00] <coys600> 3rd place playoff is pointless imo

[2022-12-11 12:17:28] <%+palachu_04> I think morocco main problem is that hte will feel the effor they are making, you can see hte injuries already
[2022-12-11 12:17:34] <$alan555> thats the difference between Croatia and Morroco, if Marroco go down 1 goal they are done

[2022-12-11 13:32:13] <chesanders8> Everyone used to be hyped for rewards Thursday

[2022-12-11 13:32:21] <@%+dezperado618> theres no winning over the community. They go 2 days with no content and FIFA Twiter is complaining
[2022-12-11 13:32:28] <!%+AlexH11231123> It feels like we’re playing Fifa in august
[2022-12-11 13:32:33] <@%$CreezyBACK> Weekly content sounds exciting af tbf
[2022-12-11 13:32:37] <+mancity225> Thoughts on militao
[2022-12-11 13:32:42] <+Enu_Macchie> blatant foul
[2022-12-11 13:32:44] <@+fifa_swift22> @hashtag_stokes dont you think 2  backs on overlap is dangerous if they counter?
[2022-12-11 13:32:50] <@%$CreezyBACK> Defo a foul just annoying they broke away
[2022-12-11 13:32:51] <%+palachu_04> half of this rat community plays for content that's why they need to pump it
[2022-12-11 13:32:54] <%+Darkmaterial95> dunno feel like it would have been a bit soft
[2022-12-11 13:32:55] <+DenizSeason> he swiped his foot and didnt touch the ball, foul all day
[2022-12-11 13:32:55] <+jmh365> Mba
[2022-12-11 13:32:55] <!%Mr_WeLLy> as an honest irish man it was a foul
[2022-12-11 13:32:56] <@%JDenman9> im actually very sad, that loss has effected me
[2022-12-11 13:32:59] <!%+acluvsufan> Oh Yh rip hesgoal
[2022-12-11 13:33:02] <@%$CreezyBACK> If they didnt score 45 seconds later it wouldnt matter but yeah...
[2022-12-11 13:33:02] <@%+dezperado618> but the initial contact was outside of the box no?
[2022-12-11 13:33:04] <yaszuro12> Did you see the refs Wikipedia bio
[2022-12-11 13:33:04] <%ItsJonesy14> the thing that annoys me is the decent meta cards are like 100k then anything better is then 1mil plus
[2022-12-11 13:33:11] <+jmh365> Mbap didn’t have a sniff
[2022-12-11 13:33:20] <!%+acluvsufan> @dezperado618 saka one not kane
[2022-12-11 13:33:24] <!%+acluvsufan> Rip he’s goal
[2022-12-11 13:33:25] <@%$CreezyBACK> @dezperado618 free kick should have been awarded in live play, no VAR criticism
[2022-12-11 13:33:27] <+Nitroz_> most of the stuff i do (gameplay wise) doesn't register and my players are always too slow, but that's down to how close i am to the servers
[2022-12-11 13:33:27] <%+palachu_04> the first pen ? both pens were clear, the second one I have no idea what went through Theo's head
[2022-12-11 13:33:29] <r4zberri> what back 4 is the best with no restrictions ?
[2022-12-11 13:33:30] <the_n0vakan3> Conspiracy theory: they didn’t give the foul because the goal was a banger
[2022-12-11 13:33:36] <@%JDenman9> went to bed so sad and pissed off
[2022-12-11 13:33:36] <@%JDenman9> loool
[2022-12-11 13:33:36] <sharkattckur> Ref was awful why give big game to donkey
[2022-12-11 13:33:40] <@%+dezperado618> @acluvsufan ohh gotcha
[2022-12-11 13:33:44] <@%$CreezyBACK> No problem with VAR it was obvs outside box just the ref in live play LUL
[2022-12-11 13:33:45] <%+ciankeeffe> @jmh365 focused too much on him
[2022-12-11 13:33:46] <%+polskamg> It's easier to handle because England play well for me.
[2022-12-11 13:33:50] <!%+acluvsufan> Homeland security are pagans
[2022-12-11 13:33:51] <+DenizSeason> we was better
[2022-12-11 13:33:54] <cheaky_barstool> you desreved  to beat them
[2022-12-11 13:34:00] <@%+dezperado618> @CreezyBACK facts
[2022-12-11 13:34:02] <@%$CreezyBACK> I was happy watching us play like we are good man
[2022-12-11 13:34:04] <cheaky_barstool> just like belgium 4 years ago, france are very lucky
[2022-12-11 13:34:05] <%+Darkmaterial95> we played better but france took chances, just one fo those games tbh
[2022-12-11 13:34:06] <yaszuro12> Mbappe did nothing
[2022-12-11 13:34:08] <marlons_brandung> when did the wc players usually get their upgrades?
[2022-12-11 13:34:09] <coys600> we should've won
[2022-12-11 13:34:09] <tutur92i> Im loving those tears man
[2022-12-11 13:34:09] <+mikael_the_mod> Deserve doesn’t not exist in sport
[2022-12-11 13:34:12] <+Enu_Macchie> 6 years ago we were getting deservedly beat by iceland
[2022-12-11 13:34:13] <+RamzyCF> ref was that poor Jude had to remind the ref to give a card lmao
[2022-12-11 13:34:13] <cjbroster> Life as an England fan and a palace fan. Will probably never ever win a trophy in my lifetime and missed our best opportunities with England
[2022-12-11 13:34:14] <%+ciankeeffe> 3?
[2022-12-11 13:34:15] <walker1231> france goals were unlucky
[2022-12-11 13:34:21] <lowlifeful> that foul on kane wasn’t in the box
[2022-12-11 13:34:24] <@%JDenman9> @cjbroster fa cup incoming cj
[2022-12-11 13:34:27] <leozo19xx> first one was outside the box.
[2022-12-11 13:34:32] <@%$CreezyBACK> It would have lead to a victory if kane scored 2nd pen I think
[2022-12-11 13:34:32] <dinu_paturica> The 3rd pen was not in the box, that is the reason why it was not called a penalty
[2022-12-11 13:34:33] <%+PadgeR6> 3?
[2022-12-11 13:34:36] <cheaky_barstool> through bells legs
[2022-12-11 13:34:37] <!%+acluvsufan> @jdenman9 shame you support spurs huh
[2022-12-11 13:34:40] <%+palachu_04> everyone complaints about allt eh refs but let me ask you. What league has good refs ? it's easy to ref games were players are not being complicated but take Argentina-Netherlands when the players are in that mood the ref always loses control of the game
[2022-12-11 13:34:40] <@%$CreezyBACK> Sad day man im sad
[2022-12-11 13:34:41] <dotBR> @marlons_brandung when ea wants, no one knows
[2022-12-11 13:34:41] <+ISoo____> You got slapped by france without Pogba and Kante
[2022-12-11 13:34:50] <%+pavett05> we were the better team but good teams see out them kind of games subs wernt great how mount and sterling came on before rashford when he was out top scorer was a joke
[2022-12-11 13:34:51] <@%$CreezyBACK> Pog and Kante LUL
[2022-12-11 13:34:55] <walker1231> pickford couldve reacted faster
[2022-12-11 13:34:56] <@%JDenman9> @acluvsufan lad you think i care who i support
[2022-12-11 13:34:57] <trilungpark> you can't ignore Kane bottled it on the grand stage
[2022-12-11 13:34:58] <@%$CreezyBACK> Slapped LMAO
[2022-12-11 13:35:00] <$monke496> you can what???

[2022-12-11 13:35:01] <ExSkallac> The upa foul was not a pen,first contact was outside the box
[2022-12-11 13:35:04] <tutur92i> and Benzema* LUL
[2022-12-11 13:35:04] <coys600> LUL LUL LUL LUL
[2022-12-11 13:35:04] <danny94832> kane had an awesome turney, feel bad for him is surely blaming himself for missing the pen
[2022-12-11 13:35:05] <%+polskamg> Man said Kante hahahahahahahahahaha
[2022-12-11 13:35:05] <leozo19xx> ill send you a picture twitter if you want, the ball was inside the box but kane wasent
[2022-12-11 13:35:06] <$monke496> feel it where??
[2022-12-11 13:35:07] <grimgorgri> ahahaha

[2022-12-11 13:35:12] <%+PadgeR6> Also the refs Wikipedia says hes born in Brazil not France btw
[2022-12-11 13:35:13] <coys600> man said slapped
[2022-12-11 13:35:14] <!%+acluvsufan> @jdenman9 I wanted a bite
[2022-12-11 13:35:16] <!%+acluvsufan> 😡
[2022-12-11 13:35:16] <@%$CreezyBACK> What an accurate description of that game "slapped"
[2022-12-11 13:35:22] <+TheMoog94> Pogba and Kante would've made their team worse
[2022-12-11 13:35:22] <cjbroster> @jdenman9 lost that final to United in 2016, probably closest we’ll ever get as well. 10 minutes away massnarSad
[2022-12-11 13:35:24] <jacob18united> we deserved it and if it wasn't for the fu**ing ref i reckon we would be through
[2022-12-11 13:35:31] <!%+acluvsufan> They slapped our backsides
[2022-12-11 13:35:33] <%+daada_sk> Boras support Croatia
[2022-12-11 13:35:39] <%+th3antman> I feel dirty. I had to win my last 2 games for 14 wins and I used a loan cruyff 🤦‍♀️
[2022-12-11 13:35:40] <@%$CreezyBACK> We had our bottoms slapped
[2022-12-11 13:35:41] <sharkattckur> Idiots who talk about first contact don’t get that if it leads to inside box it’s a pen
[2022-12-11 13:35:45] <addhyany12> Are you playing 41212 with 60 depth?
[2022-12-11 13:35:47] <whiff> no benz and nkunku either
[2022-12-11 13:35:49] <%+palachu_04> @pavett05 bruh this is this World Cup. Brazil was better than Croatia and are out, Argentina had to go to pens after deserving to win either in 90 or extra, both Spain and Portugal were better than Morocco

[2022-12-11 13:35:59] <+daniel_lee21> It started outside but he also fouled him in the box
[2022-12-11 13:35:59] <afonzy95> I thought he was russian
[2022-12-11 13:35:59] <+Jaime74_> 4222 is insane
[2022-12-11 13:36:00] <+mikael_the_mod> As French it feels good to stop the “it’s coming home” propaganda Kappa
[2022-12-11 13:36:02] <JamesStevenRFC> boras was born in croatia
[2022-12-11 13:36:02] <tutur92i> gotta love that "locked up Mbappe " trophy
[2022-12-11 13:36:03] <%zmlkc> southgate bringing on sterling and mount instead of rashford and a grealish is something we cannot go unnoticed
[2022-12-11 13:36:04] <+Vexarex> Watching Morroco and Croatia play football is worse than paying taxes
[2022-12-11 13:36:09] <@%$CreezyBACK> Everyone has injuries
[2022-12-11 13:36:11] <whiff> lmfao
[2022-12-11 13:36:14] <jhulious> Boras if from Croatia and his wife is from Sweden, no?
[2022-12-11 13:36:14] <sharkattckur> @creezyback you like that feeling though bet you felt conflicted about being slapped
[2022-12-11 13:36:16] <!%+acluvsufan> No James no sturridge
[2022-12-11 13:36:18] <@%$CreezyBACK> It wasnt even a debate of whos injured it was the ref LUL
[2022-12-11 13:36:19] <cheaky_barstool> reece james would break mbappe
[2022-12-11 13:36:19] <GokuOnCrackZ> how do u do that skill move u just did with mbappe?
[2022-12-11 13:36:25] <+mikael_the_mod> Comparing Benzema and Reece James lol
[2022-12-11 13:36:25] <%ottenpro> just packed mid maldini from the 87 icon
[2022-12-11 13:36:25] <+TheMoog94> And the best English defender this season was just picked to make up the numbers before going home
[2022-12-11 13:36:29] <%+PadgeR6> What would have RJ done better than Walker yday?
[2022-12-11 13:36:30] <%+daada_sk> is Dawood marocian?
[2022-12-11 13:36:39] <%+palachu_04> these world cup is the park the bus cup, with 48 teams coming on teh next I can't see how we are going to have better football
[2022-12-11 13:36:50] <@%+dezperado618> Dont thing Boras is married. He still refers to her as his gf
[2022-12-11 13:36:50] <cheaky_barstool> girouds performing better then benz would tbh
[2022-12-11 13:36:50] <@%$CreezyBACK> @sharkattckur ern, good 1...
[2022-12-11 13:36:50] <+MREven05> @daada_sk dont think so
[2022-12-11 13:36:52] <%+nicorocq> helped us tbf
[2022-12-11 13:36:53] <!%+acluvsufan> Giroud is better than benz
[2022-12-11 13:36:57] <ThirdSubstitute> I think he's born in Sweden but one of his parents is from Croatia
[2022-12-11 13:36:57] <+Enu_Macchie> girouds proven for france
[2022-12-11 13:36:59] <afnanfaiq93> Reece James is GOAT man
[2022-12-11 13:37:01] <cjbroster> Nope, giroud far more integral to them
[2022-12-11 13:37:01] <demontimer666> bro the first goal shouldnt of counted cos saka got fouled plus it was avoidable all 3 of our midfield was sitting on top of our centre backs the time tch got the ball it was too lat ebut we deserved to win so unlucky
[2022-12-11 13:37:03] <leozo19xx> Tweeted you bro, check whenever @hashtag_stokes
[2022-12-11 13:37:04] <@%$CreezyBACK> Giroud haunting us LUL
[2022-12-11 13:37:05] <whiff> the depth of this france squad is insane
[2022-12-11 13:37:06] <%zmlkc> they won the wc without him, giroud is too good
[2022-12-11 13:37:13] <cjbroster> And nkunku would not start over that 3 I promise you
[2022-12-11 13:37:16] <+Vexarex> I think France's midfield is much weaker w/o Kante
[2022-12-11 13:37:22] <avp0883> forgetting about kante.. haha
[2022-12-11 13:37:22] [Notification] nds1882 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 13 months! [htstokesGOAT htstokesGOAT htstokesGOAT]
[2022-12-11 13:37:24] <cheaky_barstool> no kante is huge
[2022-12-11 13:37:25] <%+nicorocq> kante specially hurt us
[2022-12-11 13:37:27] <%+palachu_04> agree, Giroud fits better than Benzema in that team
[2022-12-11 13:37:27] <%+polskamg> Tchouameni is better than Kante. It's 2022 and people still rate Kante.
[2022-12-11 13:37:30] <hallouzi> France are playing without a true playmaker tbh
[2022-12-11 13:37:30] <!%+acluvsufan> Theo btw he’s such a bum
[2022-12-11 13:37:30] <jokara5> Becuase he’s not, becuase they have giroud, he’s doing the same think as benz
[2022-12-11 13:37:32] <Kozey> I  think Touchameni is more of replacement for Kante than Pogba
[2022-12-11 13:37:34] <@%$CreezyBACK> They aint in huge form too
[2022-12-11 13:37:35] <whiff> tchouameni is better than pogba
[2022-12-11 13:37:35] <%zmlkc> upamecano really wanted to draw blood last night
[2022-12-11 13:37:37] <+TheMoog94> Kantes been poor this season
[2022-12-11 13:37:40] <$justaskingaq> raboit was good
[2022-12-11 13:37:49] <!%+acluvsufan> Me
[2022-12-11 13:37:51] <cjbroster> People forgetting Kante isn’t the same player either, Kante ain’t scoring that goal Tchou did yesterday
[2022-12-11 13:37:53] <!%+acluvsufan> Id have him on strings
[2022-12-11 13:37:58] <@%$CreezyBACK> Saka is sick cant lie
[2022-12-11 13:37:59] <iMAFlA> gold mendy
[2022-12-11 13:38:07] <crespo95> ENGLANd was much better tbf
[2022-12-11 13:38:13] <!%kiyan544> saka prop from you I can't believe what I'm hearing
[2022-12-11 13:38:14] <+mikael_the_mod> Griezman in midfield is such a great find
[2022-12-11 13:38:15] <%+nicorocq> LUL
[2022-12-11 13:38:15] <%+PadgeR6> Dunno why Southgate took him off last night
[2022-12-11 13:38:16] <kirksnake25> I was just sad grealish never got more game time
[2022-12-11 13:38:20] <sharkattckur> Taking saka off was inexplicable
[2022-12-11 13:38:21] <%zmlkc> saka taken off when he had theo on strings was wild
[2022-12-11 13:38:27] <coys600> LUL LUL
[2022-12-11 13:38:27] <@%$CreezyBACK> I wish he  was left on didnt see any reason to sub
[2022-12-11 13:38:28] <afnanfaiq93> England just miss Reece James imo
[2022-12-11 13:38:33] <+Jaime74_> sancho would be a sick cam
[2022-12-11 13:38:36] <@%$CreezyBACK> should have focused on left attacking side threat
[2022-12-11 13:38:45] <ThirdSubstitute> You're gonna need Eleven Hags to get Sancho to perform ha ha ha
[2022-12-11 13:38:47] <!%+acluvsufan> Holy fucking fifa nerd @jaime74_
[2022-12-11 13:38:50] <@+fifa_swift22> @hashtag_stokes  i can see now why ten hag wanted rabiot
[2022-12-11 13:38:51] <popzgaming> what's up stokes
[2022-12-11 13:38:52] <coys600> it's crazy how much hype there was for sancho
[2022-12-11 13:38:57] <@%$CreezyBACK> Reece would have played all tourney icl
[2022-12-11 13:38:57] <kirksnake25> Reece James best rb in football right now
[2022-12-11 13:38:58] <afnanfaiq93> That Saka and Reece on right side surely be deadly
[2022-12-11 13:39:06] <%+pavett05> u not think we would of been 5 back if reece was available
[2022-12-11 13:39:07] <kermsx> if we had james, i think  gareth may have used a 5 back
[2022-12-11 13:39:07] <themanik03> would james pocket mbappe
[2022-12-11 13:39:08] <cheaky_barstool> reece has improved defensively so much
[2022-12-11 13:39:11] <%+nicorocq> maybe
[2022-12-11 13:39:12] <dotBR> @cjbroster and probably wouldnt conced a pen, we wilp never know
[2022-12-11 13:39:26] <+Vexarex> Walker did alright against Mbappe imo
[2022-12-11 13:39:26] <@%$CreezyBACK> Too fast off the mark
[2022-12-11 13:39:26] <sharkattckur> Reece James locked up vini he could cope with mbappe
[2022-12-11 13:39:28] <demontimer666> bro walker dealt with mbappe stil
[2022-12-11 13:39:29] <@%$CreezyBACK> Walker did well tho
[2022-12-11 13:39:32] <!%+acluvsufan> No one can pocket mbappe wait till he meets me fr
[2022-12-11 13:39:35] <+KeeVos> mbappe done nothing tbf
[2022-12-11 13:39:43] <killua37x> imagine Saka and James on the right
[2022-12-11 13:39:44] <sharkattckur> Kyle walker had a gr8 game
[2022-12-11 13:39:47] <%zmlkc> i think reece james would have put a foot in earlier, walker let him run a little
[2022-12-11 13:39:51] <%xsvtton> Hendo was basically a secondary RB lmao
[2022-12-11 13:39:56] <%+iFearIess> Walker had a lot of help
[2022-12-11 13:39:57] <popzgaming> hakimi would have mbappe on toast
[2022-12-11 13:39:57] <@%$CreezyBACK> He just took the hit
[2022-12-11 13:39:58] <leozo19xx> sent twitter bro
[2022-12-11 13:39:58] <%zmlkc> shawberto kept dembele locked up

[2022-12-11 13:40:03] <!%+acluvsufan> I’m happy hendo is getting some respect
[2022-12-11 13:40:04] <@%$CreezyBACK> he played so wide too
[2022-12-11 13:40:04] <cjbroster> @dotbr yeah potentially but this argument France are weaker just a bit nonsensical to me. Can only play what’s in front of you
[2022-12-11 13:40:05] <avp0883> @KeeVos ooh so you missed the run against walker haha? dembele just bottled it
[2022-12-11 13:40:08] <@%$CreezyBACK> dragged our team over tbf

[2022-12-11 13:40:16] <%+palachu_04> I think English fans have to talk this lose lightly, all these games comes to small details. Maguire had a great header and hit the post, Giroud rebounded out of Maguire and went in. small details are making the difference in every game
[2022-12-11 13:40:16] <@%$CreezyBACK> Hendo was great icl

[2022-12-11 13:41:17] <@%$CreezyBACK> this shows his leg was leaning forwards so must be closer to the line that that angle
[2022-12-11 13:41:17] <%fipon7> for sure a foul, but not a pen

[2022-12-11 13:41:26] <fxJulian> even if it was given as a pen he would havev missed LuL
[2022-12-11 13:41:28] <+bigpokey247365> I doubt England would have been able to overcome Morocco , with all the attacking fire power , they couldn't score from open play

[2022-12-11 13:42:19] <+bigpokey247365> Southgate should be kept and the focus should be on the Euros, the qualifiers starts in March
[2022-12-11 13:42:20] <%pablo_kash> pen or nothing with VAR
[2022-12-11 13:42:24] <!%Mr_WeLLy> awful awful officiating in general most games

[2022-12-11 13:42:38] <%+palachu_04> come on guys, ig we can't agree while looking and looking do you think a ref can see everything. Let's cut them some slack. both teams play well and game could have done either way
[2022-12-11 13:42:43] <%cj_nsza> you want 3 pens in 1 game ? LUL
[2022-12-11 13:42:46] <sharkattckur> The amount of times saka got kicked in front of ref and he didn’t give it triggered

[2022-12-11 13:44:06] <%+newzuh> i think the ref felt guilt for england, so he punished france too @hashtag_stokes
[2022-12-11 13:44:07] <tejshazam> parades red u cant do that.

[2022-12-11 13:44:39] <!%Mr_WeLLy> like the most baffling decision ever
[2022-12-11 13:44:44] <cheaky_barstool> h played well against iran
[2022-12-11 13:44:47] <OhMyGode> Stokes you gotta try to be objective on this, you guys just weren't decisive enough
[2022-12-11 13:44:51] <cjbroster> The ref was appalling, as have been the majority of them this tourney
[2022-12-11 13:44:54] <tejshazam> parades shud have got a red u cant do that

[2022-12-11 13:45:00] <%+palachu_04> Portugal players were complaining about only 8 minutes

[2022-12-11 13:46:57] <scar0072> i think Pepe was feeling a lot of frustration from letting a great opportunity slip. Probably their best shot a WC in his career
[2022-12-11 13:46:59] <cjbroster> It’s weird because I think Southgate should walk ultimately

[2022-12-11 13:48:21] <%+palachu_04> @SarcasticHD1111 agree with you, I'm ARgentinean and I think if we play them we will struggle to control their speed
[2022-12-11 13:48:21] <SarcasticHD1111> Easy fix, put Konate in
[2022-12-11 13:48:32] <FALSE9lNE> hakimi vs mbappe, gonna be a great watch
[2022-12-11 13:48:36] <%+xxreddevil16xx> We getting a Licha card today???
[2022-12-11 13:48:41] <%aidan_acluvsufan_fan> dududududududu dudududu SALIBA
[2022-12-11 13:48:44] <GamerXD_PT> im sorry but they should of not put referees that are from Argentina, it doesn't make sense to me....
[2022-12-11 13:48:50] <%zmlkc> he was molesting them man so many unnecessary attempts that ref turned a blind eye
[2022-12-11 13:48:56] <!%+acluvsufan> Arsenal gassing a saliba semi final bro man pls he’s not touched the ball yet
[2022-12-11 13:48:56] <GamerXD_PT> on the Portugal game
[2022-12-11 13:48:58] <$alan555> first they have to beat Croatia
[2022-12-11 13:48:59] <%+iFearIess> What if it the 2018 rematch?
[2022-12-11 13:48:59] <rietz> i think last final as last time
[2022-12-11 13:49:06] <DannEE__> You played lamaynard?
[2022-12-11 13:49:07] <scar0072> I was really hoping for a messi-Ronaldo final
[2022-12-11 13:49:08] <%+palachu_04> @ThirdSubstitute why should have been messi booked ? for talking to the ref ? Berghius talked to the ref in a worse way and did not get a yellow. Ref avoided a red card to Timber in extra time, come on
[2022-12-11 13:49:09] <sharkattckur> Stokes Southgate in or out? Surely he has to go
[2022-12-11 13:49:13] <SarcasticHD1111> @palachu_04 exactly. Even if you double team Mbappe on the wing, he’ll still get loose
[2022-12-11 13:49:14] <popzgaming> Argentina will play a back 5
[2022-12-11 13:49:22] <cheaky_barstool> hakimi is rapid
[2022-12-11 13:49:47] <!%+acluvsufan> It’s when mbappe slows you down then just darts
[2022-12-11 13:49:49] <%+iFearIess> Morocco is gonna have to play him like England did
[2022-12-11 13:49:50] <cheaky_barstool> tuchel

[2022-12-11 13:57:39] <sharkattckur> I meant from last night
[2022-12-11 13:57:43] <+frazmo_> All the players will get it, some more than other but that’s because there’s idiots that sit and home and feel the need to abuse people for losing a game of football

[2022-12-11 13:57:48] <%+ciankeeffe> didn't he deactivate his insta yesterday
[2022-12-11 13:57:49] <sharkattckur> Saka literally getting abuse cos of yday
[2022-12-11 13:57:49] <%S1cko10> Mbappe toxic rat
[2022-12-11 13:58:04] <samafca123> How is Saka getting abuse? He was the key player yesterday
[2022-12-11 13:58:09] <%zmlkc> idk why kane went same side tho, gk tend to dive the same way as first pens
[2022-12-11 13:58:11] <%+bendavies123> saka played well
[2022-12-11 13:58:37] <jabs_dell> saka got more abuse on insta yesterday than kane and he was the best player on the pitch. sums up the country
[2022-12-11 13:58:45] <+mheavey1992> Saw some people abusing rashford for the free kick at the end, this country is toxic
[2022-12-11 13:58:51] <$justaskingaq> exactly
[2022-12-11 13:58:57] <%+bendavies123> kane got lots of abuse yesterday stop waffling
[2022-12-11 13:58:58] <@%+dezperado618> I heard he tried to change directions at the last min
[2022-12-11 13:59:02] <%aidan_acluvsufan_fan> think he tried to put more power on it to try and beat lloris in case he dived there but overcooked it
[2022-12-11 13:59:03] <+Vexarex> Can't blame Kane that's huge amounts of pressure in that point of the game
[2022-12-11 13:59:06] <@%+skimpolelives> If only Kane had the pen mindset of Sonyman123!
[2022-12-11 13:59:15] <%+ItzSaunders> he's our pen taker while he's on the pitch he takes them
[2022-12-11 13:59:16] <AgwariusEU> fr people change so fast
[2022-12-11 13:59:21] <soloplays99> But second pens are harder because you’re constantly in your head about wether to go the same Side or not
[2022-12-11 13:59:26] <jabs_dell> if kanes pen was on target then he scores as lloris is awful at saving pens##
[2022-12-11 13:59:26] <!%Daanfc> I think he saw lloris going to his normal corner and wanted to adjust last minute
[2022-12-11 13:59:36] <wallahiville> i wouldve bagged both top bins
[2022-12-11 13:59:37] <sharkattckur> @bendavies123 that’s my whole point he played well and got abused last night where as Kane responsible for his misses got oh head up harry I’m tired of the media not protecting the players equally
[2022-12-11 13:59:37] <!%dHorrorist_> milner calm as u like
[2022-12-11 13:59:37] <%+bendavies123> Lampard was good at them
[2022-12-11 13:59:39] <!%+acluvsufan> Toney and Milner if only we had them 😔
[2022-12-11 13:59:44] <%aidan_acluvsufan_fan> im immune
[2022-12-11 13:59:44] <%+xxreddevil16xx> There was NO ONE BETTER ON THAT PITCH for England to take that pen. Kane's record is AMAZING at pens
[2022-12-11 13:59:46] <landeskog> hstikkytokky has started streaming on twitch now
[2022-12-11 13:59:48] <+CFCDondre> Most of the abuse was from foreigners not even English people as well
[2022-12-11 13:59:49] <%+iFearIess> Hakimi clear...
[2022-12-11 13:59:50] <kermsx> mark noble too
[2022-12-11 13:59:52] <djz19_> hazard
[2022-12-11 13:59:52] <%+bendavies123> Lampard was good at them stokes
[2022-12-11 13:59:55] <TLOTOOLE> Ricky Lambert for me
[2022-12-11 13:59:55] <ThirdSubstitute> A lot of England fans' expectations are insanely high in my opinion, all this talk about 'needing' to win a trophy like you're the top nation in the world
[2022-12-11 13:59:56] <$justaskingaq> i would if taken foden off at halftime for rashford
[2022-12-11 13:59:57] <!%+xjazzg123> Gerrard and Lampard were really good
[2022-12-11 13:59:58] <%xsvtton> James Milner my goat
[2022-12-11 13:59:59] <%aidan_acluvsufan_fan> i think i would've converted it for sure
[2022-12-11 13:59:59] <sharkattckur> I would choose neymar
[2022-12-11 14:00:01] <dotBR> Baggio was a great pen maker and lost one on the wc final
[2022-12-11 14:00:02] <%zmlkc> na there aint but also statistically speaking, keepers dive to be a hero so going hard af down the middle but people insist on hitting corners
[2022-12-11 14:00:02] <leozo19xx> James milner
[2022-12-11 14:00:03] <rietz> die on gta
[2022-12-11 14:00:03] <leozo19xx> or Messi
[2022-12-11 14:00:04] <%cj_nsza> neymar dont miss pens
[2022-12-11 14:00:05] <cheaky_barstool> i remember someone pointing a laser in cr7s eyes while he took one in russia or brazil
[2022-12-11 14:00:07] <%+bendavies123> For me Lampard
[2022-12-11 14:00:07] <%xsvtton> Milner

[2022-12-11 14:00:19] <ThirdSubstitute> I take Andre Iguodala
[2022-12-11 14:00:20] <%ItsJonesy14> if you go and watch an international pen shootout live you'll realise how crazy the pressure is
[2022-12-11 14:00:20] <+frazmo_> If Kane doesn’t take that second pen and someone else steps up and takes it imagine the abuse first of all and the mental effect that would have on Kane, he’s captain and pen taker, he has to take it
[2022-12-11 14:00:21] <yo_pieerree> I’m picking balotelli
[2022-12-11 14:00:22] <jbo_diego_davy> Pirlo probably best penaltie taker
[2022-12-11 14:00:22] <samafca123> I’d pick Maguire

[2022-12-11 14:00:58] <%aidan_acluvsufan_fan> tbf a field goal looks easy to score
[2022-12-11 14:01:02] <!%+xjazzg123> NFL kickers legit only get paid for that situation though
[2022-12-11 14:01:05] <jj_efc> ninja had a point tbh
[2022-12-11 14:01:07] <coys51> it's not just England fans other nations also abuse there players Spain and Portugal are super toxic

[2022-12-11 14:01:52] <ThirdSubstitute> @soloplays99 yeah but you haven't had any great results against top nations, not saying you couldnt win it all but there are a lot of countries on par/better than England atm imo
