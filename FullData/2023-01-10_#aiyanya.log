[2023-01-10 10:03:10] <WitherBlaster> 20 seconds should fit 8 or 9 GCDs, right? I think that'd be the magic combo, Goring Blade, a buffed Holy Spirit, and some Atonements to fill it out.

[2023-01-10 10:14:16] <MiridaeTheGiraffe> Yeah, my static WAR gets destroyed during savage content. I feel like they're a lot better with mobs than single targets.
[2023-01-10 10:14:20] <!%LulubyVT> hey, if war is doing my job, that means i get to DPS more
[2023-01-10 10:14:27] <Debaros> In honesty, WAR is still not up to par with other tanks in high end content due to DPS being so behind but its a funny change
