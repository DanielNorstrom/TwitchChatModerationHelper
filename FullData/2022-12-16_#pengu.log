[2022-12-16 12:28:42] <Pasithhh> im trying to prove a point to all my friends that console players arent shitty on pc
[2022-12-16 12:29:25] <jetstreamlev> i've been enjoying ranked 2.0 but before i got into it the climb up to my average rank looked like it was going to be really annoying

[2022-12-16 12:30:34] <ItsSamW96> @The_Shadowman01 i get that, im usually d1 and it takes ridiculously long to get back each season and with all the toxic people its a chore, the rep system has also been great to nullify that
[2022-12-16 12:30:37] <frealarker> i was a hard stuck gold on xbox i switch to pc and i hit gold way more ez then i did on xbox

[2022-12-16 12:31:50] <ItsSamW96> @The_Shadowman01 the amount of champs you see with 0 game sense and unable to do basic strats, just brainless aim
[2022-12-16 12:32:33] <Pasithhh> i mean i have the knowledge and ik what to do because im from console @itssamw96

[2022-12-16 12:41:06] <+TheLegitox> you can make 2 bars 1 longer 1 shorten and show it visualy

[2022-12-16 12:41:56] <+zealpep> so as a returning player to the game how do i know what weapon attachments are best for each the guns now?
[2022-12-16 12:42:08] <+TheLegitox> 2 bars would have been better my g this looks weird af
[2022-12-16 12:42:19] <taidor6> Basically using higher DPI means that looking into multipliers to specify sens is recommended I guess

[2022-12-16 12:43:39] <kiarshh> I think you are wrong, for example 6 6 on 800dpi is 11 11 on 400, this is somthing not many players know but when you double the dpi your sens will be slightly less than double.
[2022-12-16 12:43:39] <+Appiecake> bro its simple math
[2022-12-16 12:43:48] <zZzZennyy> @The_Shadowman01 its okay bro

[2022-12-16 12:50:06] <kiarshh> @kiarshh idk what it is but Its related to circular speed for dpi, for example games that have no vertical and horizontal and have only 1 general sens will be fine when you double your sens and half you dpi.

[2022-12-16 13:31:25] <liuzhaoqi> imo AI art can't be consider as intellectual property
[2022-12-16 13:31:25] <!%realjimmyjams> classic ranked
[2022-12-16 13:31:31] <ferroactiv0> AI art is only to be used to create concepts or ideas. Not to create a final piece
[2022-12-16 13:31:34] <devconn95> Is Blackbeard still a troll pick?
[2022-12-16 13:31:49] <bigperk2> He has emp with no recoil

[2022-12-16 13:32:15] <ferroactiv0> Of course. I'm saying how you should use it.
[2022-12-16 13:32:19] <%+iamAdzy> some person made 432k selling AI art
[2022-12-16 13:32:32] <%$RStep_> that’s crazy
