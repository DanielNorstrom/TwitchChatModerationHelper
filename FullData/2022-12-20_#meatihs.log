[2022-12-20 20:57:51] <androidrevolution> i once got a golden legendary and a normal legendary in the same pack
[2022-12-20 20:57:52] <SpaceCaveOne> 40 cards makes you too slow to find the good ones, the 10 health offset that
[2022-12-20 20:57:58] <venturemann> armor druid still good with renathal
[2022-12-20 20:57:58] <+reaperonetho> i thought it was bugged and i bought (for free) others packages
[2022-12-20 20:58:00] <P1nkrabb1t> still opens up the deckbuilding, more fun with 40 cards still i think, but Def lower winrate
