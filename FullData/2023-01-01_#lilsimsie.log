[2023-01-01 02:26:51] <zhaneel> hey simsie, i've been curious about this for a while - sometimes you'll do videos about a mod like better build/buy which seems like it'd make your life easier, but in subsequent videos you don't have them installed. is it to avoid giving new players a false impression of the game, or something else?

[2023-01-01 03:04:08] <@%^Moobot> simsieNo NO, DO THIS! CHANGE THIS! EWWWW! Backseat gaming is NEVER allowed. Suggestions are always appreciated, but do not attempt to make demands or force Kayla to do anything. There is a difference between friendly suggestions and aggressive demands. Ultimately she is the one playing the game, not you! simsieNo
