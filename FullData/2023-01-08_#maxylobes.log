[2023-01-08 06:53:50] <zombi3slay3r60> ive barely played Hardcore Mode but im sure that its reputation iss what scares people so they overexaggarate how hard it is
[2023-01-08 06:53:59] <+theWabbiit> Agreed. It was the highlight of the DLC for me.
[2023-01-08 06:54:01] <Hootsington> Will teh Dead Space Remake be worth a hoot?
[2023-01-08 06:54:28] <Hootsington> Hmmm.
[2023-01-08 06:54:30] <%+Pollitosh> i love watching interviews wth the director of dead space, dude is passionate about game making
[2023-01-08 06:54:35] <Hootsington> Yeh. I see.
[2023-01-08 06:54:57] <JayJaysCatCafe> that's how my response was to the mannequin part. I wasn't like this is so spooky. my response was oh man this is so cool.

[2023-01-08 06:56:03] <+theWabbiit> I‚Äôm guessing they only said that because of the RE3make backlash?
[2023-01-08 06:56:08] <unknownabysss> they said casual playthrough is 15 hours
[2023-01-08 06:56:47] <xSevenOut> I honestly reallly enjoyed RE3 remake. I played it more than any of the other remakes. I think it was just fun. Too short, but fun.
[2023-01-08 06:56:59] <JayJaysCatCafe> it can be the same length and people will still find a way to bitch about it. that's the internet.

[2023-01-08 07:56:52] <JayJaysCatCafe> I want a RE game where in a cutscene it's finally address what characters do with herbs. like it has to be absurd but everyone just acts like it's normal. lol

[2023-01-08 07:57:52] <Ugh_What_Now> @jayjayscatcafe Right? They can't be smoking them because they take them straight from the plant, so are they chewing them, stuffing them in a bite wound, making pasta? mzflexConfused

[2023-01-08 07:59:06] <JayJaysCatCafe> I just want a character casually smoking it. like it's just something everyone does with these herbs

[2023-01-08 08:07:26] <+PooTipp> Always take my two weeks off for gdq every year so excited to see it Tuesday !!!
[2023-01-08 08:07:26] VIEWERS: 754
[2023-01-08 08:07:46] <unknownabysss> it wouldnt be a remake without the island
[2023-01-08 08:07:48] <im_iLL> as long as there is no machine gun zombies
[2023-01-08 08:08:09] <+dranksouls> Man they shoulda just removed the conclusion because some people received some parts of that area poorly
[2023-01-08 08:08:16] <liebermannen> @im_iLL Oh, there will be
[2023-01-08 08:08:21] <ScruffyTM> last i read, they said they wanted to add more to it not reduce from the RE4 Remake but that could be hearsay
[2023-01-08 08:08:25] <+SuperCezo> I just hope they remove the novistadores, but I guess they are overhauling the Island also
[2023-01-08 08:08:32] <ohbe0ne> what would've been terrible imo if they split the game in 2 releases
[2023-01-08 08:08:50] <SoftboySocialClub> wonder if they'll keep the chapter system at all
[2023-01-08 08:09:05] <im_iLL> more interaction with Mike so his death is more impactful
[2023-01-08 08:09:08] <im_iLL> that would be dope
[2023-01-08 08:09:08] <ohbe0ne> i hope so its iconic
[2023-01-08 08:09:10] <+dranksouls> they should just redesign some of the gun fights maybe
[2023-01-08 08:09:19] <ScruffyTM> @im_iLL agreed
[2023-01-08 08:09:26] VIEWERS: 735
[2023-01-08 08:09:38] <Nyrebo> i think most of what people dislike about the island is very treatable to keep its identity but make people happy
[2023-01-08 08:09:50] <ScruffyTM> i just want them to fully remake the mercenaries mode
[2023-01-08 08:09:50] <imilion99> Krauser, U3 and the Regenerators make the island worth the time for me. But yeah, it has its issues
[2023-01-08 08:10:05] <im_iLL> i honestly never had an issue with the island
[2023-01-08 08:10:08] <s09negan> thanks Maxey and chat! agree with what ya all said
[2023-01-08 08:10:32] <im_iLL> i didn't know people hated the island until i heard other people talk about it lol
[2023-01-08 08:11:26] <kittenstaco> its mostly padding
[2023-01-08 08:11:27] <im_iLL> define filler in an RE game
[2023-01-08 08:11:28] <Nyrebo> the island is a great microcosm for RE4 in general for me. Great but with quite a few things that make me roll my eyes when i have to do it lol

[2023-01-08 08:12:23] <+SuperCezo> Yes, I hate that Ashley driving part
[2023-01-08 08:12:23] <s09negan> i just hope sneaking plays a big part of remake. but it will also be intresting to watch all speed runners run remake!
[2023-01-08 08:12:29] <imilion99> the only thing that I dislike from the island is Mike's section and the stage that happens before you rescue Ashley for the last time lol

[2023-01-08 09:40:16] <totallynotandy> @sham101 for me personally. i feel like AGDQ became to political. I just want to see people playing games and earning money for a good cause. I don't want to see all that other stuff

[2023-01-08 09:45:05] <Pancoar> @totallynotandy literally exposed LMAO
[2023-01-08 09:45:06] <+forzagambit92> Pronouns are literally on screen, how do they take time away from the games? KEKW
[2023-01-08 09:45:09] <Onyx_And_Roman> calling supporting all people a political issue onyxan4Thonk
[2023-01-08 09:45:09] <%MacMakoShark> pronouns are really nice to know so you know how to address the runner? Voice is not always an indicator
[2023-01-08 09:45:13] <%+Darcean> @totallynotandy exposed asf.
[2023-01-08 09:45:14] <%tyzula__> lmao hi maxy and chat what a conversation to come in on
[2023-01-08 09:45:15] <totallynotandy> exposed in what?
[2023-01-08 09:45:17] <%gachabasta> @s09negan the thing is, they want to make sure the runner is referred to correctly. if you're a guy and your pronouns are he/him for example, and I called you "she," you'd be pretty pissed probably
[2023-01-08 09:45:21] <+ko1ru> 1000% NODDERS
[2023-01-08 09:45:30] <s09negan> like just keep it gaming related ect.
[2023-01-08 09:45:32] <NnyThulhu> someones gender or race is not important to the speedrun
[2023-01-08 09:45:36] <capsaicinJT> to right wingers, human rights are political, because they fundamentally can't accept that they lost those arguments decades ago
[2023-01-08 09:45:36] <totallynotandy> lol that ''twitter'' caught metnality
[2023-01-08 09:45:42] <@%LunaGeme> zeldacwNotlikethis
[2023-01-08 09:45:46] <brookipants> yikes imagine living in a bubble where you think blm and lgbtqia+ people shouldn't be heard, have rights or be spoken about
[2023-01-08 09:45:47] <%sham101> @NnyThulhu agreed
[2023-01-08 09:45:56] VIEWERS: 832
[2023-01-08 09:46:03] <%tyzula__> imagine being bothered by pronouns tho
[2023-01-08 09:46:07] <totallynotandy> I AM GAY you special people
[2023-01-08 09:46:07] <Faithless_Zealot> I'd have to agree with the chatter guy. You don't need to constantly be telling people that they're "included". Just include them
[2023-01-08 09:46:08] <+magnis22> I came in at the right time. LUL LUL
[2023-01-08 09:46:12] <KringBrotherWave> i hate when people say they "hate" pronuns, like bozo you use pronouns in your everyday speech. Its called grammar
[2023-01-08 09:46:20] <Pancoar> imagine thinking minorities wanting to be treated decently is WAHHH MUH POLITICS
[2023-01-08 09:46:29] <%gachabasta> but the point is not necessarily "here's this person's gender" it's just how to correctly refer to the person!!
[2023-01-08 09:46:37] <Onyx_And_Roman> being gay and complaining GDQ helps support your ideology and creed
[2023-01-08 09:46:42] <%sham101> i dont need gdq to protect my rights LUL
[2023-01-08 09:46:42] <s09negan> @gachabasta  regardless,  i still address the runner by their name. idc about anything else. if they can speed run im all for it.
[2023-01-08 09:46:44] <%+Kreedos> Kevin Spacey also said he's gay, just sayin.
[2023-01-08 09:46:45] <Pancoar> @totallynotandy lol sure
[2023-01-08 09:46:47] <Faithless_Zealot> Cause that's not what the event is about?
[2023-01-08 09:47:03] <+Zommybait> why do you get to decide what their event is about?
[2023-01-08 09:47:04] <totallynotandy> For the same reason i dont like getting adds of starving children during my comedy shows during new years. I would just like to enjoy my content
[2023-01-08 09:47:09] <%Caveman8080> bawkCorn
[2023-01-08 09:47:16] <%+Kreedos> Kind of the same vibe, I'm gay so I can say whatever?
[2023-01-08 09:47:18] <%+Kreedos> Nah
[2023-01-08 09:47:21] <Darkness_comes> @Pancoar if it's about inclusivity than what "minorities" you are talking about?
[2023-01-08 09:47:23] <%sham101> im gay and disabled i just like games being played fast
[2023-01-08 09:47:27] <Klymenaras> I'm watching Madness Mod right now and I am suffering, you are mad for completing that, good job!
[2023-01-08 09:47:29] <+ChainsawBees> you're talking to a brick wall its not worth it
[2023-01-08 09:47:31] <+ko1ru> @kreedos Truuuue

[2023-01-08 09:47:40] <%AllInOneMighty> When is the right time for you to get ads about starving children?
[2023-01-08 09:47:40] <+forzagambit92> Then just watch the runs you want to watch and close the stream when you don‚Äôt want to KEKW

[2023-01-08 09:48:32] <capsaicinJT> reminder, GDQ is primarily a charity event, the speedruns are secondary to the social justice aspect of the event. it's all related. the human rights stuff is part of the event, if you don't like it that's a you problem

[2023-01-08 10:12:44] <liquafool> I loved going to a 24hr donut place at 3AM when they were making the morning batches
[2023-01-08 10:12:47] <+diet_depression_> Donuts have always been breaksfast.
[2023-01-08 10:12:56] <@%Zaruborah> Okay chat. Real talk. Breakfast food specifically, Pancakes or Waffles?
[2023-01-08 10:13:01] <o_g_had> jaysFat
[2023-01-08 10:13:06] <%+Kreedos> Pancakes.
[2023-01-08 10:13:07] <+ChainsawBees> Pancakes
[2023-01-08 10:13:08] <%MacMakoShark> coffee cake is cake for breakfast which means it slaps NODDERS
[2023-01-08 10:13:08] <TrinityThatcher> Donuts were the treat food dad would buy you when you were running late to school ü§£ü§£ü§£
[2023-01-08 10:13:10] <+MushyyMushy> It was a special treat as a kid to have donuts for breakfast
[2023-01-08 10:13:13] <%$kansascity_chiefs1983> waffles
[2023-01-08 10:13:13] <%$randgridr> Waffles
[2023-01-08 10:13:14] <Onyx_And_Roman> gotta be waffles
[2023-01-08 10:13:19] <+coldstare180> waffles always waffles!
[2023-01-08 10:13:20] <+BTVelrock> waffles
[2023-01-08 10:13:24] <%crowhogen> My mom worked making donuts in college, so ive always thought they were only breakfast pastries. Im sad that people went without them for breakfast
[2023-01-08 10:13:24] <%gachabasta> @zaruborah I'm a waffle guy, the holes filling up with butter and syrup is the GOAT
[2023-01-08 10:13:26] <TrinityThatcher> @zaruborah Pancakes. Waffles are cringe.
[2023-01-08 10:13:34] <+ChainsawBees> they have the IT factor
[2023-01-08 10:13:36] <+MushyyMushy> Pancakes bawkHyper
[2023-01-08 10:13:36] <nerdingputik> that would also make you wonder if your mom was just hiding somewhere near testing you LUL
[2023-01-08 10:13:39] <+Shadow_Neko> Pancakes are too heavy i feel, waffles hit just right eabCOMFY
[2023-01-08 10:13:45] <%gachabasta> though tbh both are good, and I will turn down neither
[2023-01-08 10:13:46] <%$randgridr> I'll revise: Waffles, unless I'm the one having to make them. Cleaning a waffle iron is a pain in the ass.
[2023-01-08 10:13:50] <%MacMakoShark> pancakes. waffles take too long unless im microwavin them
[2023-01-08 10:13:52] <%$kansascity_chiefs1983> would rather have French toast

[2023-01-08 10:14:01] <Onyx_And_Roman> waffle can give you some crunch in addition to the flakey syrup deliverer

[2023-01-08 10:16:59] <%MacMakoShark> id say either NOTED sometimes if i really want sweet i go fruit and syrup
[2023-01-08 10:17:10] <unknownabysss> sausage and eggs for breakfast is the best

[2023-01-08 11:24:37] <%+YamaJuugo> Based on the pictures they tweeted it with it‚Äôs probably the Norse arc for god of war
[2023-01-08 11:24:39] <@%H1pp0__> @deepreceiver you have youtube yourself, do you not? Hmmm
[2023-01-08 11:24:39] <FoilsArt_> Live action is bad for this
[2023-01-08 11:24:59] <+PrimeDarkseid> the words you searching you all is. Greek Kratos or Norse Kratos
[2023-01-08 11:25:09] <%sham101> theyre profitable for the IP and nothing else... rings of power, wheel of time, the witcher
[2023-01-08 11:25:14] <%sham101> just vague fantasy
[2023-01-08 11:25:26] <freeman0001> Greek era god of war live action with danny devito as kratos. Billion dollar franchise easy
[2023-01-08 11:25:31] <avernu5> greekgodx Kratos or bausffs Kratos EZ
[2023-01-08 11:25:31] <FoilsArt_> They do it because it‚Äôs cheap
[2023-01-08 11:25:32] <+TheUnsungLegion> it works more for last of us since thats closer to reality but for something as fantastical as god of qar i dont think it really works
[2023-01-08 11:25:52] <+PrimeDarkseid> Greek kratos is too OP for a show to be accurate
[2023-01-08 11:25:56] <I_Am_Shuu> @h1pp0__ they go into a bunch of speedrunners chats and ask that lol
[2023-01-08 11:26:00] <%+YamaJuugo> The new ones are better for many reasons
[2023-01-08 11:26:13] <%+YamaJuugo> Unrelated to preference even
[2023-01-08 11:26:16] <avernu5> actually, just copy Northman cast and chill EZ

[2023-01-08 11:26:22] <+UncannySnail> I will say, if The Last of Us was not following Joel and Elle I might be less skeptical. Though trying to do a 1:1 story, when character development happened a lot during gameplay I'm super skeptical.
[2023-01-08 11:26:52] <Kyrael99> @TheUnsungLegion It feels like God of War is the type of show that really needs to be an animated one instead of live action. Allows it to really lean into the absurd action elements
[2023-01-08 11:26:56] <@%H1pp0__> @I_Am_Shuu for sure. but i gots nothing better to do rn Okayge

[2023-01-08 11:27:40] <%sham101> the gameplay in TLOU2 was really good
[2023-01-08 11:27:40] <avernu5> how do you film doki, doki is the real question LuL
[2023-01-08 11:27:43] <YerDinner> yeah, they should more set the shows in the world of X rather than re-telling the same story imo
[2023-01-08 11:27:53] <%+YamaJuugo> We can‚Äôt even get the fkn remake LUL
[2023-01-08 11:27:55] <%Klarden> not true, they've made an update a month ago

[2023-01-08 11:28:34] <+UncannySnail> it's okay get ready for the, like, 15th assassin Creed game

[2023-01-08 11:31:57] <%Klarden> I just happen to follow Jordan Mechner on twitter (the creator of Prince of Persia series who was the lead designer of Sands of Time too), so he is unsurprisingly sharing these types of updates :)
[2023-01-08 11:32:02] <JayJaysCatCafe> @yerdinner there was a gameplay trailer. I don't doubt it'll be out this year.

[2023-01-08 11:32:58] <%Klarden> I still wonder if Hellblade 2 will be the first UE5 to get released
[2023-01-08 11:33:10] <FoilsArt_> I wish Netflix did live action anime of more grounded series that you know actually possible, Psycho pass could be a cool love action crime series
[2023-01-08 11:33:17] <freeman0001> Heckblade
[2023-01-08 11:33:26] <%+UncannySnail> Isn't that wukong game coming out this year gonna be first UE5 game ?
[2023-01-08 11:33:43] <JayJaysCatCafe> @foilsart_ best anime of all time. would translate super well
[2023-01-08 11:33:44] <%Klarden> switch to UE5 has been tough for many
[2023-01-08 11:33:45] <Onyx_And_Roman> as in that weird future journey to the west game?
[2023-01-08 11:33:58] <+TheUnsungLegion> @klarden fortnite is ue5 now
[2023-01-08 11:34:01] <%+YamaJuugo> i think you're thinking of wolong
[2023-01-08 11:34:11] <freeman0001> Isnt monster a good candidate for live action anime? I dunno much about it other then its pretty dark.
[2023-01-08 11:34:20] <%+YamaJuugo> or Wo Long *
[2023-01-08 11:34:23] <Onyx_And_Roman> wo long isnt until spring but ye i think its this year
[2023-01-08 11:34:23] <%Klarden> @TheUnsungLegion oh yeah, you are absolutely right. technically Fortnite is the first commercially available UE5 game
[2023-01-08 11:34:25] VIEWERS: 1¬†046
[2023-01-08 11:34:57] <FoilsArt_> Yoo monster as a live action series that be cool
[2023-01-08 11:34:57] <%Klarden> which is unsurprising, Epic know their own engine
[2023-01-08 11:34:58] <%+YamaJuugo> the Wukong game is also supposedly this year, but they are different games
[2023-01-08 11:35:10] <+TheUnsungLegion> which kinda makes sense since epic own UE
[2023-01-08 11:35:10] <%+UncannySnail> oh yeah I'm talking about Black Myth Wukong. it looks like a good game still
[2023-01-08 11:35:15] <freeman0001> Sorry guys but there was a horror game released on steam in November that used ue5 and it sucked lol
[2023-01-08 11:35:30] <freeman0001> Meat harvester or something like that
[2023-01-08 11:35:35] <roy4200626> im also streaming this game
[2023-01-08 11:35:51] <%+YamaJuugo> they both look sick though, and the names are very similar so I don't fault anyone for the mixup LUL
[2023-01-08 11:36:01] <JayJaysCatCafe> all of blooper teams future releases are UE5 as well. lol

[2023-01-08 11:36:38] <%+UncannySnail> I hope first releases of UE5 games are good, because lots of games using UE4 are still rough today
[2023-01-08 11:36:38] <FoilsArt_> UE5 Fortnite doesn‚Äôt look bad I only play that game with my little brother
[2023-01-08 11:36:45] <freeman0001> The devs dropped like 200 gift subs in a streamer i watch chat and begged em to play it lol
[2023-01-08 11:37:19] <%+YamaJuugo> @freeman0001 are you talking about Ela?
[2023-01-08 11:37:23] <%+YamaJuugo> i think I was there for that lol
