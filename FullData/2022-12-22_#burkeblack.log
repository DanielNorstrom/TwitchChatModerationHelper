[2022-12-22 06:49:49] <redentropy_> The main issue I think is supposed to be the wind,  I'm in Iowa and we're forcasting 50 MPH+ wind, taht with the snow will create whiteouts
[2022-12-22 06:49:51] <+TymlesswandeR> its -8 but feels like -20 here in CO
[2022-12-22 06:49:52] <$TunnelRatXIII> It's going to be bad. Pipes will freeze solid, powerlines will snap. Any flesh exposed to the wind outside will freeze solid in a matter of seconds. The oceans will recede and humanity will end its days in darkness.
[2022-12-22 06:49:57] <@%xReadyAimMissx> @ToastFPS Yeah but for us it's mostly the windchill that's gonna be cold. the normal temp isn't gonna be too bad. Kappa

[2022-12-22 07:49:28] <%were_all_mad_here_1865> They want more drama my thought to add more filler.
[2022-12-22 07:49:39] <%+Guttsu_The_Gamer> I understand the need to adjust source material for tv, but the changes in witcher were so bad
[2022-12-22 07:49:49] <%chronicr4ge> no, they admitted to mocking the source material

[2022-12-22 07:50:51] <Skreepy1> "mocking" might mean "we are going our own direction with story"
[2022-12-22 07:50:55] <%Tigonstar> @Guttsu_The_Gamer they inserted some wokeness in the witcher netflix series.
[2022-12-22 07:50:56] <%Lain_2779> there is at least 1 writer that has been talking shit on twitter
[2022-12-22 07:50:58] <%PKM4STER> if you're writing your own thing, dont use the witcher ip. thats all i have to say LUL
[2022-12-22 07:51:11] <Jedgar6> i don't mind if they aren't 1:1 with the source material...BUT...they have to make it as good or better as the original or else we are wasting our time.
[2022-12-22 07:51:14] <%Tigonstar> the new Willow series is bad too
[2022-12-22 07:51:22] <hornycorndogg> Thee twitter of multiple writers has been a shit show
[2022-12-22 07:51:25] <Vermifaux> They shouldnt have bothered with Geralt's story and just went with some other witcher.
[2022-12-22 07:51:38] <ProjectCNGG> Burke you should really read the books or get the audiobooks for the witcher, you'll love them and also see why so many people are upset by the changes :)

[2022-12-22 07:51:43] <@%+Jigawatts42> burke the showrunning for X-Men 97 was a writer on witcher and said there were many writers who did indeed make fun of the source material, so he made it a requirement for his new show that you had to be a fan of the original show
[2022-12-22 07:51:46] <+KarnalSanders> The new Willow is terrible, agreed @Tigonstar
[2022-12-22 07:51:58] <VrtniPatuljak> Witcher writers that never even read the book. StarWars writers that never saw the movies LUL
[2022-12-22 07:52:00] <+Johnny_Gory> I'm not looking forward to this next season of the witcher. Such a shame
[2022-12-22 07:52:01] <%kimba274> thing is, if you want your own fantasy, write your own and don't butcher your source. season 2 of witcher made no flarking sense

[2022-12-22 07:52:02] <ProjectCNGG> Like season two has nothing to do with the books

[2022-12-22 07:52:17] <%+Guttsu_The_Gamer> the first witcher book is a series of short stories, perfect for episodes, and it would have been dope, but they kinda ignore most of that

[2022-12-22 07:52:28] <%Tigonstar> warwick's acting is bad and he has no magic and teh show is not really about him lol
[2022-12-22 07:52:29] <Skreepy1> I just looked it up. There is a Gamerant article about them mocking the source material
[2022-12-22 07:52:40] <%chronicr4ge> https://gamerant.com/the-witcher-writer-recalls-staff-mocking-source-material/
[2022-12-22 07:52:47] <Skreepy1> a writer said it during an Instagram live
[2022-12-22 07:52:48] <%ChesticlesMcgee> if they arent going to stick with cannon for an established character in the source material, then create a new character in the same universe and do what you want.

[2022-12-22 07:52:59] <%Tigonstar> imagine calling a show "Willow" and then making it about other BS characters
[2022-12-22 07:53:05] <+KarnalSanders> @Tigonstar the "kids" in that show act like zoomers, its really takes you out of it
[2022-12-22 07:53:08] <%chronicr4ge> was an ex writer that left and said the show runner actively criticized sourve material;
[2022-12-22 07:53:20] <@%Mrfarside44> Depends on how much you hold on the ex writer
[2022-12-22 07:53:27] <MadMathis> Anyone read the Shadow Moon trilogy set in the Willow universe? I remember liking it as a kid but I might not have known better at the time.

[2022-12-22 07:53:41] <velimirius> yeah, problem with all new shows is that they just want to have easy milking  on established characters and IP instead of making something new
[2022-12-22 07:54:00] <%PKM4STER> its bad yeah, thats why its popular. great logic YEPP
[2022-12-22 07:54:05] VIEWERS: 1 577
[2022-12-22 07:54:07] <velimirius> and they just hire crap writers to write whatever instead to adapt
[2022-12-22 07:54:16] <%chronicr4ge> its just hollywood riding the train of whats popular until they can do what they want
[2022-12-22 07:54:17] <+Johnny_Gory> and that writer is gone and they others stayed... yikes
[2022-12-22 07:54:28] <@%+Jigawatts42> that made me all the more excited for X-Men 97
[2022-12-22 07:54:31] <%oldmannmikey> Yeah, but not ALL of the writers. And you don't want a room full of fanboys writing the show, right? you want some alternative opinions?
[2022-12-22 07:54:33] <DonkeyWonk> Netflix is jumped the woke shark long ago
[2022-12-22 07:54:33] <@%Mrfarside44> Add that and Henry who loves to source so no surprise it went way it did Sadge
[2022-12-22 07:54:35] <%Tigonstar> @velimirius yeah all these reboots thrive off the past-glory of the original stuff. and what they deliver is mediocre crap with other themes
[2022-12-22 07:54:39] <+KarnalSanders> It's called bad production, for the witcher series, nothing to do with wokeness
[2022-12-22 07:54:41] <Jedgar6> makes sense why henry left
[2022-12-22 07:54:49] <%chronicr4ge> fantasy/gaming content is popular so they get on board with the subject and then tell the story they want and not what the viewers want

[2022-12-22 07:57:19] <$PoorDawg> agreed
[2022-12-22 07:57:20] <azriel2k3> I think if they are going to keep going with the witcher after henry cavill they should do a time jump to old man geralt (assuming he doesn't die in season 3) and have Ciri grown up and the lead. Cast Mads Mikelson as Geralt @BurkeBlack
[2022-12-22 07:57:22] <%Lain_2779> thats what I mean, its like the people yelling "socialism!!!!"
[2022-12-22 07:57:22] <SwartzT> LUL

[2022-12-22 08:20:17] <$TunnelRatXIII> ETF are stock portfolios with a general yearly return of 5-8%. They are groups of the biggest companies put together, like the Dow Jones and S&P 500 (i think, I could be wrong on those)
[2022-12-22 08:20:18] <%+CurlyRichard> Do you know about the S&P 500 which is the collection of the top 500 companies it's an etf in itself
[2022-12-22 08:20:21] <%+Mangyanimal> ETFs are when you ignore chat and go to a licensed stock broker

[2022-12-22 09:41:41] <b9chomps> @BurkeBlack, is ultrawide feasible for a streamer? maybe not worth going away from 16:9
[2022-12-22 09:41:43] <insanemoose> but its worth it

[2022-12-22 09:42:57] <%Lain_2779> you would pretty much have to do like with tiktok to use ultrawide for streamer, and only capture the middle of the screen

[2022-12-22 09:43:16] <insanemoose> it has to be widescreen
[2022-12-22 09:43:22] <%Tigonstar> OLED is nice but so expensive
[2022-12-22 09:43:29] <insanemoose> its a simle factor of how they cut them in china
[2022-12-22 09:43:36] <insanemoose> they dont cut 27 inches

[2022-12-22 09:44:23] <%Twisted_Steel> Don't go 32 1440p it's the same pixel density as 24 1080p so it doesn't look much better especially if you factor in price.
