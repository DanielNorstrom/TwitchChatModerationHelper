[2022-12-24 18:42:21] <%ZestyCow> Probably, maybe they learned lesson from lighthouse. Lighthouse was just the test
[2022-12-24 18:42:34] <%WhoDatStreamer> its not that people want it early - we have just been hearing about it for well over a year now.  Same with arena and what not.  we just want it in general
[2022-12-24 18:42:36] <%HitByBeat> probably 20 max i think
[2022-12-24 18:42:39] <%+youezzyttv> HOPEFULLY NOT TO MANY CAUSE 15 players = atleast 4 rats

[2022-12-24 20:42:24] <doznyan> How does this event endorse people to play the game? Looting, making money IS the point of this game. When you remove that, what reason is there even to join a raid? This event is very bad
[2022-12-24 20:42:25] <%+muddycan> And yes @axel_tv how is yours and burr bet gonna play out since it‚Äôs half of streets?
