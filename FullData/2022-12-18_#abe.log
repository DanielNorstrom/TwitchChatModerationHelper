[2022-12-18 00:02:52] <+STELLARMN> you can't afterlife diy i think
[2022-12-18 00:02:55] <%+WilliCookie> Can only do one or the other
[2022-12-18 00:03:07] <ahokkeli> either will exhaust the crystal tho?
[2022-12-18 00:03:24] <%$Tawnnie> Yea we build shop and chill baboComfy
[2022-12-18 00:03:40] <%DrTasslehoff> You can’t afterlife modified crystals have to use Phoenix
[2022-12-18 00:03:43] <sexychefshane> thought you an't afterlife modified crystals with catalysts
[2022-12-18 00:04:14] VIEWERS: 654
[2022-12-18 00:04:17] <%+sarcastic_minion> afterlife can add curses
[2022-12-18 00:04:25] <marcus_cain> does phoenix feather exhaust?
[2022-12-18 00:04:35] <%+lunate87> hmm, couldnt u downgrade the vault so u dont get exp
[2022-12-18 00:04:37] <%+WilliCookie> Either Phoenix or Safezone
[2022-12-18 00:05:04] <+Thakul> probably end up with void trapped x 4
[2022-12-18 00:05:10] <%+LaLaBriar> what does phoenix do?
[2022-12-18 00:05:23] <%the_khaliah> I say you Pheonix
[2022-12-18 00:05:30] <ahokkeli> @lalabriar basically same as afterlife
[2022-12-18 00:05:37] <+tyranitylerr> You will be fine. just don't hit the spawners. your running straight to omega rooms
[2022-12-18 00:05:38] <+krahnsters> Can't you just avoid POIs and run for the Omega rooms?
[2022-12-18 00:05:40] <%+Addrax> Pete's Dragon vault last night was a Void Vault
[2022-12-18 00:05:40] <%$Tawnnie> Afterlife more important
[2022-12-18 00:05:41] <marcus_cain> yeah maybe downgrade and SafeZone?
[2022-12-18 00:05:43] <cibi_x> go with someone doll for more gear?
[2022-12-18 00:05:44] <vtwixii> Afterlife go for the safest route imo.
[2022-12-18 00:05:49] <%DrTasslehoff> So long as you’re not looting POIs you should be relatively safe even in void
[2022-12-18 00:05:54] <%+LaLaBriar> @ahokkeli ohh ty
[2022-12-18 00:05:56] <+wheaties23> just dont hit mimics and trap them, also dont loot common rooms
[2022-12-18 00:05:59] <%+sarcastic_minion> phoenix it
[2022-12-18 00:06:15] VIEWERS: 654
[2022-12-18 00:06:21] <curran007> i dont think u will die and even if shit happens u still have more then enough to get some good gear back
[2022-12-18 00:06:41] <+wheaties23> 70% of my rune vaults have been void theme
[2022-12-18 00:06:50] <+tyranitylerr> Void isn't bad just don't hit poi straight to omega rooms
[2022-12-18 00:06:51] <%+LaLaBriar> HUH
[2022-12-18 00:06:54] <%$Tawnnie> It’s not about getting back gear is the feeling of dying
[2022-12-18 00:06:58] <%+WilliCookie> Either lose 5% of gear to trapped or lose all of it to void theme
[2022-12-18 00:07:05] <+wheaties23> yea
[2022-12-18 00:07:25] <marcus_cain> use diamonds to bring the level below void possibility?
[2022-12-18 00:07:29] <uneasyplatypus7> so pheonix it
[2022-12-18 00:07:33] <uneasyplatypus7> its the smart play
[2022-12-18 00:07:35] <uneasyplatypus7> just do it
[2022-12-18 00:07:38] <+wheaties23> you should be fine just ignoring common rooms
[2022-12-18 00:07:42] <%DrTasslehoff> Runes are just a method to bypass the level requirement, which is a longer task to obtain
[2022-12-18 00:07:45] <+STELLARMN> time immunity idol makes void vault useless
[2022-12-18 00:07:48] <kriptou21> @marcus_cain even lvl 0 vault with runes can be void
[2022-12-18 00:07:56] <%KoalaMager> Prayge
[2022-12-18 00:08:00] <curran007> good luck
[2022-12-18 00:08:01] <marcus_cain> @kriptou21 ahh ty
[2022-12-18 00:08:14] <+wheaties23> block all entrance and exits then
[2022-12-18 00:08:14] <uneasyplatypus7> bring buckets for the void liquid?

[2022-12-18 00:08:31] <kriptou21> take idol with you
[2022-12-18 00:08:33] <%+Taticles> Infinite water bucket is so good for enderman in void vaults
[2022-12-18 00:08:34] <%+LaLaBriar> take time immunity idol just in case itt is void

[2022-12-18 00:13:02] <Shenemir> I did the math and you've used exactly 20% of your total skill essence for skill orbs so far. What are the odds.
[2022-12-18 00:13:05] <LaboePlay> thay can count lvels + extra
[2022-12-18 00:13:06] <nadikatta> Count how many skill point you have spent and subtract your vault level
[2022-12-18 00:13:06] <%+Scoobyfred27> difference between your lvl and spent points?
[2022-12-18 00:13:11] <BigDoggxx2> is there a state that shows how many you used?

[2022-12-18 00:16:57] <%PaneHS> @dr_verm yes but some of those werent crafted
[2022-12-18 00:17:18] <%+LaLaBriar> the stats have reset at some point
[2022-12-18 00:17:28] <%$Tawnnie> And skill point adjustment too making it more expensive
[2022-12-18 00:17:29] <%+LaLaBriar> likely when the server was moved
[2022-12-18 00:17:41] <%raspberrykelly> i dont think you crafted that many early on... maybe 20-25 total
[2022-12-18 00:17:56] <chico9206> and how many skill orbs crafted?
[2022-12-18 00:17:59] <+dr_verm> crafting stats are bugged anyway, depending on if you craft at table, SSN, click full stacks...
[2022-12-18 00:18:20] VIEWERS: 692
[2022-12-18 00:18:46] <Hrry> cant you figure it out by counting your skill points in your character and minus your level?
[2022-12-18 00:18:55] <+dr_verm> it's unclear how they arrive at the numbers, but I've seen several instances that are obviously wrong across items and players

[2022-12-18 00:19:31] <%+LaLaBriar> that would make sense

[2022-12-18 00:19:50] <+dr_verm> if crafted 11, then you bought 20, does that sound right?
[2022-12-18 00:19:50] <madmoe111> Did you buy any from the black market?
[2022-12-18 00:19:50] <chico9206> any vod goblins
[2022-12-18 00:20:08] <%+WilliCookie> Let’s say you’ve crafted 21 skill orbs that’s equal to 168 skill shards that you’ve used and you scrapped 150ish

[2022-12-18 01:06:38] <sofiane_mrch> the imposter
[2022-12-18 01:06:41] <trust199sk> iskall was saying that it will be rare because he intends to do such runs for higher lvls
[2022-12-18 01:06:41] <PogaafThe2nd> no no seriously iskall even said it's possible
[2022-12-18 01:06:53] <0theancientone> Clueless surely intended
[2022-12-18 01:06:53] <ngolongsl1> iskall85 said it's possible
[2022-12-18 01:06:57] <vtwixii> Iskall already take it from him LUL
[2022-12-18 01:06:57] <+kyanshiba> yeah
[2022-12-18 01:07:11] <%$Tawnnie> 2x mine rune is already mind breaking
[2022-12-18 01:07:11] <chico9206> the 0 common is a bug for sure linked to dolls
[2022-12-18 01:07:15] <phantomvander> yours was 16

[2022-12-18 01:09:02] <Hrry> double mine room drop is.. even crazier
[2022-12-18 01:09:07] <%raspberrykelly> mayb he was guaranteed an omega rune since you got one
[2022-12-18 01:09:14] <%+LaLaBriar> dolls generate their own loot shrugEg
[2022-12-18 01:09:15] <MellowKate> @cibi_x ty, nice
[2022-12-18 01:09:20] <%$Tawnnie> Technically you both can share a vault and run together with crazy modifiers

[2022-12-18 01:11:33] <%+sarcastic_minion> instability or something
[2022-12-18 01:11:40] <KiiWiiiii> mm monolith abuse i guess
[2022-12-18 01:11:52] <%+LaLaBriar> chosen came in for a reason other than free crate
[2022-12-18 01:12:07] <KiiWiiiii> true
[2022-12-18 01:12:07] <%Ahzathoth> this was a transactional instance as opposed to abuse
[2022-12-18 01:12:10] <Hrry> Pink Puzzle Block also feels equivalent to a Monolith Chest. So feels like equivalent exchange.
[2022-12-18 01:12:11] <NotSkilledUE> could happen on boss vaults as well
[2022-12-18 01:12:28] <%+LaLaBriar> not wrong
[2022-12-18 01:12:30] <snackinsnorlax> swetJERRY

[2022-12-18 01:31:25] <%+beltar_the_attritionist> You need dolls of undying for that right?
[2022-12-18 01:31:25] <PogaafThe2nd> great idea

[2022-12-18 01:31:38] <GunnerHQ> ir, even better, the price would be a crystal and some other thing
[2022-12-18 01:31:40] <%+Taticles> You could charge them a crystal for it which you can then use to craft more
[2022-12-18 01:31:41] <matikss321> 100 souls for doll :D

[2022-12-18 01:32:14] <+Tatzesan> 1 Crystal + a bunch of soul shards maybe ?

[2022-12-18 01:32:31] <velveeda> They can drop off their dolls and could pay with crystals to keep up your lower level stalks plus whatever you decide as you want as payment
[2022-12-18 01:32:31] <midnight_hail> you could do them in level ranges like 20-29, 30-39 etc

[2022-12-18 03:40:58] <kendi_artista> no beating them with a sword
[2022-12-18 03:40:59] <+StrykerAX> they hold swords Pog
[2022-12-18 03:40:59] <teh0mega> too bad you don't have any bottles

[2022-12-18 03:41:18] <+ChocOhNo> i wonder if theres other dog breeds
[2022-12-18 03:41:19] <+kay_taureau_17> waystone and come back for them
[2022-12-18 03:41:29] <+waikitakore> Now make this your base so you don't have to bring them back Kappa
[2022-12-18 03:41:31] <zerogiven> Do you have cages?
[2022-12-18 03:41:33] <S3rp3nt_007> omg that shiba with a sword reminded me of that one meme with a dog running around with a knife in its mouth LUL
[2022-12-18 03:41:36] <+ostralo> u can use a flute no ?
[2022-12-18 03:41:45] <byzantine279> Mobs can teleport through warp plates fyi
[2022-12-18 03:41:48] <midnight_hail> cages
[2022-12-18 03:41:49] <Treity> Adopts a beautiful Shiba... immediately abandons it
[2022-12-18 03:41:52] <+kay_taureau_17> do mob cages work?
[2022-12-18 03:41:52] <ThoIo> can you not use animal jar?
[2022-12-18 03:42:06] <zerogiven> Iron and wood for cages
[2022-12-18 03:42:07] <its_honk> what are we looking for?
[2022-12-18 03:42:09] <%+lunate87> hmm wont they despawn
[2022-12-18 03:42:15] <%celinabena> we're on a tree hunt
[2022-12-18 03:42:19] <+StrykerAX> could probably quickly craft a supplementaries cage
[2022-12-18 03:42:19] <+monsterdrea> i think if you put a lead on them you can use the waystone and it will teleport them with you
[2022-12-18 03:42:20] <+itskathrn> they wont despawn if tamed
[2022-12-18 03:42:23] <teh0mega> you can't get animals out of jars either
[2022-12-18 03:42:23] <+jojoluvsmc78> you can't them back out of the jars so no
[2022-12-18 03:42:25] <Treity> @its_honk Some tree
[2022-12-18 03:42:37] <%+B1LB0_LAGG1NS> cant you make waystone from the jewel?
[2022-12-18 03:42:37] <+Thakul> ask Kara, she was moving cats with a cage earlier
[2022-12-18 03:42:40] <+mizbizbby> anyone know why we hunt for tree?
[2022-12-18 03:42:51] <S3rp3nt_007> worth a shot
[2022-12-18 03:42:54] <+waikitakore> yep
[2022-12-18 03:42:59] <%celinabena> because he wants to mizbizbby
[2022-12-18 03:43:01] <PogaafThe2nd> maybe with a lead
[2022-12-18 03:43:08] <+jojoluvsmc78> if they work like vanilla wolf they teleport back you
[2022-12-18 03:43:13] <+kay_taureau_17> what is the tree for? a crystal?

[2022-12-18 03:43:25] <CaptIChaos> you need a leed on animals to tp them back
