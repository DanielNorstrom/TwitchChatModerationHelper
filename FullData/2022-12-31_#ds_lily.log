[2022-12-31 01:16:07] <%Nite01> I literally enter it by mistake EVERY SINGLE MAP
[2022-12-31 01:16:11] <%Nite01> its so annoying
[2022-12-31 01:16:12] <SinSmooth> I havent tried to go in since campaign, I've been in every map.
[2022-12-31 01:16:14] <+notorious_irv> it only auto sucks on the first suck
[2022-12-31 01:16:17] <atrialfibrilation> skill issue tbh
[2022-12-31 01:16:27] <%Nite01> also for some reason it always spawn inside some breaches
[2022-12-31 01:16:36] <%Nite01> so I basically also lose dmg uptime on that
[2022-12-31 01:16:47] <Varkorium> Yeah the league mechanic is exactly like my relationship, when I want it I can't go in, when I don't it sucks me in :(
[2022-12-31 01:16:56] <%Nite01> the thing is with vortex I already dont see shit
[2022-12-31 01:17:08] <%Nite01> the mechanic is basically the same color

[2022-12-31 23:45:31] <snuggless21> The average lifespan of an ant can be anywhere from a few weeks to 15 years.
