[2022-12-11 14:15:21] <%$StealthWeeaboo> @singsing @Darth_Pantsu Bees normally are known to buzz. But they also, surprisingly, will "quack" and "toot". These sounds were puzzling, but after a recent discovery, it was found out that they're related to a hive splitting off. Queens will "quack" to have bees release them, but if a queen is making a "toot" sound, it will cause the workers to not release any queens until they can't hear the queen taking part of the hive away. This process cycles until the hive is fully dispersed.

[2022-12-11 15:09:58] <Reveangence> @nguyentran_ Sometimes it's good to avoid using a build if it's your 1st ever playthrough, then use a proper build for your subsequent runs

[2022-12-11 15:15:35] <%xpcqe326> the worst thing is I think he spec a node that spefically destroy corpse so detonate dead dont work
[2022-12-11 15:15:35] <Cascinha> the shittiest part too is that he had corpse clear, but uniques can't be cleared so the only corpse left was the boss body --> DD that

[2022-12-11 15:30:43] <+bobbity_the_builder> it's basic currency, very tradeable
[2022-12-11 15:30:48] <%reactive_power> energy blade is a cool skill
[2022-12-11 15:30:49] <+bobbity_the_builder> also useful
[2022-12-11 15:30:51] <%+stillexistgladge> chaos orb is default currency, like a dollah
[2022-12-11 15:30:57] <agentxiri> mastah sing do u know about the determination aura buffs from a while ago?

[2022-12-11 15:31:12] <xtralevel> too much thing to read if playing this game. sadly i cant read
[2022-12-11 15:31:21] <xpentakill> gives armour
[2022-12-11 15:31:27] <fatedreamer> so just one fine day ppl just make chao orb the "gold" of the game? lol
[2022-12-11 15:31:32] <+bobbity_the_builder> temporal rift allows you to go back in time to a point you choose.
[2022-12-11 15:31:38] <Deimoset> Its weaver ultimate
[2022-12-11 15:31:40] <+bobbity_the_builder> at least in terms of hp, mana, es etc.
[2022-12-11 15:31:41] <%+bd26> @fatedreamer basically yes
[2022-12-11 15:31:43] <agentxiri> determination gives a decent amount of flat armour and also %more armour
[2022-12-11 15:31:44] <jovitacky> determination aura is armor
[2022-12-11 15:31:50] <fatedreamer> @fatedreamer kinda Weird but neat at the same time
[2022-12-11 15:31:50] <%onlyfansing> @singsing Sir lucky this game not have damage number on screen
[2022-12-11 15:31:56] <%reactive_power> fatedreamer sort of, there's other currency way more valuable than chaos orbs though
