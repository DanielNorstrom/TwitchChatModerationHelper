[2022-12-17 11:13:11] <$divinelaziness> Aware thinking about WoW vs playing it
[2022-12-17 11:13:21] <%+theus_crw> maybe in his head, math didn't win the round with calveit?
[2022-12-17 11:13:44] <mickeyAD_> @divinelaziness lots of quality changes, professions, talent trees, flying is actually engaging now, leveling feels quite smooth as well
[2022-12-17 11:14:46] <$divinelaziness> thats good, i liked wow tbh but the timesink just puts me off
[2022-12-17 11:15:37] <nekkrous> penetrating missile vs the offering she told you not to worry about Sadge
[2022-12-17 11:16:09] <nekkrous> only if if bricks I suppose
[2022-12-17 11:16:10] <mickeyAD_> @divinelaziness if you don't have time yeah not very good idea to start, but depends on your needs, always
[2022-12-17 11:16:17] <nekkrous> missile always deals damage
[2022-12-17 11:16:18] <Ghocifer> isnt glynnis basically a percival but for aassimilate?
[2022-12-17 11:16:21] <mickeyAD_> Oferring actually competitive? I guess any card with the word destroy is in that tier KEKL @Spyro_ZA
[2022-12-17 11:16:48] <shashank0034> isn't this sus?
[2022-12-17 11:17:19] <nekkrous> same as piggy is a percival for crimes most factions have something similar @ghocifer
[2022-12-17 11:17:19] <9r4n0> is there a good syndicate deck?
[2022-12-17 11:17:19] <mickeyAD_> puts all the bombs to shame
[2022-12-17 11:18:35] <nekkrous> yeah Sassy
[2022-12-17 11:20:31] <shashank0034> is this deck better than the other

[2022-12-17 11:21:08] <shashank0034> I'm asking to test ur knowledge HamStare
[2022-12-17 11:21:15] <shashank0034> this is an examination
[2022-12-17 11:21:19] <mickeyAD_> Torres is such an insane card, however you look at him, 1st form infinite reach, plus carryover/thinning KEKL and 2nd form just too flexibie with the replays, be it either tall punish or points
[2022-12-17 11:21:42] <%+reryaa> torres is insane yeah and this meta is outpointing old decks Sadge
[2022-12-17 11:22:07] <shashank0034> why not first form the girl?

[2022-12-17 11:27:34] <testing_pred> @thornyreborn the open world is beautiful, I liked the multiple combat stances, they gave some depth to combat and makes you feel like a badass

[2022-12-17 14:42:05] <ThoMax_mixxer> I haven't played gwent in ages and just read on reddit that the game is being abandoned by cdpr ? What did I miss
[2022-12-17 14:42:30] <orthodoxpeasant> Well next year will be the last card drops & tournament. After that it will be silent
[2022-12-17 14:43:10] <BrausStocker> what do u mean?

[2022-12-17 14:43:40] <BrausStocker> @insilico_man whats gonna happen after year?
[2022-12-17 14:43:50] <ThoMax_mixxer> will gwent die after that or what is the theory of what will happen after that
[2022-12-17 14:43:53] <%$xtskater> blows my fkn mind they won't integrate this game with witcher 3/4 instead of abandoning
[2022-12-17 14:43:56] <a_sad_tuna> This is so sus
[2022-12-17 14:44:03] <%insilico_man> in 2024  gwent goes into maintenance mode
[2022-12-17 14:44:22] <%insilico_man> meaning no new cards or balance patches etc.
[2022-12-17 14:44:29] <BrausStocker> why?

[2022-12-17 14:44:48] <ThoMax_mixxer> yeah why don't they keep the game around. It's just stupid to abandon a project they have put so much into
[2022-12-17 14:45:24] <%$xtskater> cdpr hasn't been the same since dropping cyber trash, lots of lies, lots of failure

[2022-12-17 15:59:35] <robert1dz> you probably could do bomb build with it
[2022-12-17 15:59:46] <61Namzo> idk i feel like bombs are boring

[2022-12-17 16:04:11] <%north_forever> you could equip something like the

[2022-12-17 16:04:42] <%north_forever> and not have the hood

[2022-12-17 16:05:11] <%+fullhaeuss> Since you mentioned shani, anyone else feel like the romance scene felt kind of forced on Geralt?
[2022-12-17 16:05:19] <%+fullhaeuss> Like it's so awkward to avoid it
[2022-12-17 16:05:23] <%insilico_man> he wanted to amnesty that i guess
[2022-12-17 16:05:36] <plapes> In tw3 or overall?
[2022-12-17 16:05:41] <%+fullhaeuss> TW3
[2022-12-17 16:06:08] <%north_forever> @fullhaeuss not really
[2022-12-17 16:06:28] <%+fullhaeuss> especially because most people probably play the DLC pretty late and you probably have the big romance locked in at that point
[2022-12-17 16:06:40] <%north_forever> @fullhaeuss avoid yes but you can still say no at the end
[2022-12-17 16:07:26] <BrausStocker> okay i hit 2500 with harmony i am done for today KEKL
[2022-12-17 16:07:46] <%north_forever> like giving her the flower (don't know the name for it) is a must to not make it awkward but you don't have to go with romance
[2022-12-17 16:09:17] <%+fullhaeuss> I know but it feels awkard to me. You basically have no way to avoid all the tension and then Geralt just goes yea no. Maybe it's just me.
[2022-12-17 16:09:49] <%north_forever> it's thier realationship in general all the way from witcher one and somewhat in the books
[2022-12-17 16:10:14] <%+fullhaeuss> it's not like Geralt and Yen or Triss give much of a fuck about monogamy lol
[2022-12-17 16:10:19] <%sp1cy_gr> She was 16 in the books Susge
[2022-12-17 16:10:34] <%north_forever> Geralt likes her but he feels like he can't be WITH her because he's a witcher
[2022-12-17 16:10:39] <netrunner54> she WHAT SUSSY
[2022-12-17 16:10:39] <%north_forever> she's a medic

[2022-12-17 16:11:55] <%north_forever> although Geralt did seem really fond of her

[2022-12-17 16:13:13] <%north_forever> @north_forever with her it's more fucked because shani wants to be a mother have a home etc.
[2022-12-17 16:13:37] <%north_forever> @north_forever really gimme a minute
[2022-12-17 16:14:37] <%north_forever> Dandelion called Shani over to pretend to flirt while he was being pursued by Dijkstra's men, and their encounter led to him asking her to deliver a message to Geralt for him. Shani delivered that message, and during their initial encounter, the two of them were about to have sex when Dandelion interrupted them.
