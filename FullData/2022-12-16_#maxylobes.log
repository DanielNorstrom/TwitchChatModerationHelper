[2022-12-16 05:24:01] <Solghettoguy> well they did do a death scene skip button
[2022-12-16 05:24:11] <+TheDementedSalad> It's 2022 it should be bare minimum to have cutscene skip tbh
[2022-12-16 05:24:17] <+frozenchops> a mission replay would be nice too. i want to get my audio log achievement without replaying the whole game
[2022-12-16 05:24:27] <%AllTheReddest> Howdy maxy and party

[2022-12-16 05:24:52] <chartreusejoker> unfortunately its also 2022 and we have npcs in most games that spoil the game and tell you where to go as you go lol
[2022-12-16 05:25:42] <!%$Disturbedguy666> cant wait to play ragnarok. but its gonna be hard to avoid spoilers untill i can play it lol

[2022-12-16 05:26:12] <+TheDementedSalad> Meh I wouldn't say it's excusable when the likes of MGS4 have cutscene skip
[2022-12-16 05:26:17] <+frozenchops> especially when they charge $70 for a less than 8 hour game thats half baked on launch
[2022-12-16 05:26:21] <%$treefro_> NODDERS

[2022-12-16 05:44:07] <chartreusejoker> so you are saying if you bottled it, and shook it up it would explode all over the kitchen?
[2022-12-16 05:44:07] <Pwnzorrz> Never could wrap my head around kombucha. Find it spooky and disgusting
[2022-12-16 05:44:21] <VogueRogue> I give this banana/10

[2022-12-16 05:45:03] <@%+Piccolo113> Dude, it's almost funny how quick people are to dogpile on someone asking for spoilers to stop.

[2022-12-16 06:03:53] <!%Peanut_Hotdog> Oh heck yeah

[2022-12-16 06:04:37] <!%Peanut_Hotdog> I just can't stand going from 60 to 44 frames over and over. I might have to try Direct 12 again then

[2022-12-16 06:07:13] <!%Peanut_Hotdog> It's hard to go back to 30 when you're so used to being at a higher res

[2022-12-16 06:10:51] <kei_77> Why do companies need to wait till it releases and people have a sour taste. This always happens about week 1 or 2 too. Why don't they learn.
[2022-12-16 06:11:04] <m0nkey2316> Hi
[2022-12-16 06:11:06] <mashtriangle> was the dodge busted or did it feel ok?
[2022-12-16 06:11:11] <Solghettoguy> @ItsQueenNovaa they changed the speed of the healing and weapon swap
[2022-12-16 06:11:18] <SomethingBarbaric> hard to gauge the crowd beforehand
[2022-12-16 06:11:23] <kei_77> It's too late people have already dunked on the game mainstream
[2022-12-16 06:11:32] <%Silverwolf32> Is that not what play testers are for though?
[2022-12-16 06:11:37] <kei_77> But that's why there is QA
[2022-12-16 06:12:06] <+MagatsuDante> Considering crunch was talked about here
[2022-12-16 06:12:12] <kei_77> Like it's always basic shit that passes their QA that is a no brainer
[2022-12-16 06:12:15] <+MagatsuDante> doubt all of the QA team's suggestions got through

[2022-12-16 06:12:44] <%+Xlucrd> Will you be running Callisco now that they fixed a few things ? @maxylobes
[2022-12-16 06:12:45] <+MagatsuDante> They clearly wanted Callisto out before Dead Space
[2022-12-16 06:12:47] <TrinityThatcher> Literally, it can be a matter of having fresh eyes on something. Even QA has to play the same game 1000 times and get used to how it is. When I made a visual novel, I didn’t notice a lot of things in beta until people pointed them out and gave me suggestions
[2022-12-16 06:13:02] <unknownabysss> i feel bad for donna
[2022-12-16 06:13:10] <+howy96> I used to be a play tester. Main thing we looked for was glitches, crashes, ect. We can give feedback on mechanics like that but most are ignored
[2022-12-16 06:13:11] <%+NitzTripleSix> its not if they want to its if the director thinks its worth enough effort to resolve before launch
[2022-12-16 06:13:14] <johnny191> Stupid idiot
[2022-12-16 06:13:22] <mashtriangle> if QA was the end all be all, we’d never have bad games lol
[2022-12-16 06:13:23] <@%+Piccolo113> I mean, this question is what gave rise to the Early Access era where people buy the game at a cheaper price to play it while it's still in development. But not all developers are comfortable, or able to take that approach.
[2022-12-16 06:13:29] <+MagatsuDante> RIP Donna Sadge
[2022-12-16 06:13:32] <kei_77> This is why Nintendo will always have polished games, they will push a game out if it's not ready most times.
[2022-12-16 06:13:32] <hyg3a> Yessir!
[2022-12-16 06:13:42] <kei_77> I mean delay

[2022-12-16 06:13:58] <!MemoriesEmbrace> What about pokemon violet/scarlet

[2022-12-16 06:14:07] <@%H1pp0__> polished YEP
[2022-12-16 06:14:07] <kei_77> Pokemon isn't Nintendo
[2022-12-16 06:14:13] <+MagatsuDante> Like very fun game but holy hell the polish is not there
[2022-12-16 06:14:17] <@%+Piccolo113> @Silverwolf32 Pokemon isn't a Nintendo game. It just releases on Nintendo systems.
[2022-12-16 06:14:38] <+soccer_whovian> Pokémon is game freak
[2022-12-16 06:14:38] <kei_77> fucking chat trying to get a cheap dunk on a non-nintendo game LUL
[2022-12-16 06:14:41] <+EliteLordSigma> Yeah, Game Freak isn't exactly known for being technical wizards.

[2022-12-16 06:15:22] <KNIGHTOFELEMIA> Nintendo is co owner of pokemon along with two other companies
[2022-12-16 06:15:28] <Roguecowboy22> straight to the castle!!
[2022-12-16 06:15:29] <%oryaj_archives> LUL
[2022-12-16 06:15:32] <Fatalkill3r> yeah I did every glitch in the game
[2022-12-16 06:15:32] <mkgdx> and get the Master Sword as soon as you get to it
[2022-12-16 06:15:35] <+soccer_whovian> I still need to play botw enigmaCozy
[2022-12-16 06:15:37] <@%+Piccolo113> Doesn't mean they're developers of them, @KNIGHTOFELEMIA
[2022-12-16 06:15:38] <%+TheSanctusNex> Ocarina of Time is a good example. They literally arbitrary code executed a fucking Breath of The Wild Machinima with live Twitch Chat at GDQ. That was amazing and broken.
[2022-12-16 06:15:54] <Roguecowboy22> oh lord his face
[2022-12-16 06:15:54] <unknownabysss> i think as long as it didnt break the game they will probably ship it
[2022-12-16 06:16:02] <kei_77> @KNIGHTOFELEMIA Yea exactly they own a third. They only have exclusive rights.
[2022-12-16 06:16:17] <Fatalkill3r> breath of the wild is amazing but filled with glitches
[2022-12-16 06:16:54] <kei_77> The average player isn't going to run into those glitches though. I played almost 100 hours with 0 issues idk.
[2022-12-16 06:16:59] <+Nadestark> exactly, its impossible for 100 players to find everything
[2022-12-16 06:17:05] <johnny191> Can’t defend anyone after CD Projekt Red
[2022-12-16 06:17:13] <@%+Piccolo113> Devil's Advocate comments aside, I feel people trying to use Nintendo as a shining beacon of Quality Upon Release are just remembering back in the day when Nintendo used to talk about their Nintendo Seal Of Approval ™
[2022-12-16 06:17:15] <KNIGHTOFELEMIA> No Nintendo is the platform one develops the pokemon game
[2022-12-16 06:17:25] <AlmostElise> wehn you realize your own experience doesn't dictate everyones
[2022-12-16 06:17:32] <AlmostElise> 0:
[2022-12-16 06:17:40] <Roguecowboy22> for the amount of things you guys find they should pay you lol
[2022-12-16 06:17:40] <%Silverwolf32> Which is also a good reason for all games to have a demo before release imo
[2022-12-16 06:18:03] <AlmostElise> its sad demos have been dying
[2022-12-16 06:18:10] <+EliteLordSigma> Pokemon also gets hamstrung by the behemoth of a multimedia empire built around the games.
[2022-12-16 06:18:12] <@%+Piccolo113> Nah, cause if they did that, then the games would be fixed up and the neat stuff would be patched out.
[2022-12-16 06:18:14] <%+NitzTripleSix> best QA testers are speedrunners
[2022-12-16 06:18:20] <puripuribetamale> Back. . . 4 Blood?

[2022-12-16 06:24:19] <Lets_Go_Raichu> i was duplicating pokemon in brilliant diamond and then they patched it :(
[2022-12-16 06:24:25] <%mikekillv> Nintendo is Mom from Futureama
[2022-12-16 06:24:33] <%oryaj_archives> They will patch the Mario movie
[2022-12-16 06:24:36] <ZER0CIOUS> i cant really stand nintendo games anymore

[2022-12-16 06:25:00] <KNIGHTOFELEMIA> Nintendo took down screen shots of a Mario 64 strategy guide the guide was only in Japan
[2022-12-16 06:25:31] <+Shimoroku> at least, Nintendo didn't create a new version of a game seemingly to just break speedrunning routes, like Fromsoft did with DS2
[2022-12-16 06:25:35] <%+NitzTripleSix> myamoto bowser and gamefreak

[2022-12-16 06:27:43] <kei_77> They make the base games too. Tecmo made Three Houses and Engage.
[2022-12-16 06:27:45] <gerikuso> technically they made smash
[2022-12-16 06:27:48] <+Silverpslm> never heard from anyone how it was

[2022-12-16 06:32:32] <Love4TheBay> @s09negan RE2 is the best in the series and the best remake IMO

[2022-12-16 06:32:59] <@%+Piccolo113> LUL
[2022-12-16 06:32:59] <%+TheSanctusNex> Who stole this Hammer Main from the Monster Hunter series?
[2022-12-16 06:33:22] <s09negan> i was hoping when they made remake, the mash re 2 and re 3 together. then release outbreak after xD
[2022-12-16 06:33:26] <TrinityThatcher> And then he made The Guy Game, accidentally filmed a bunch of underage women in bathing suits, and disappeared off the face of the Earth
[2022-12-16 06:33:27] <+Silverpslm> Ya know what's one thing about REVillage I don't like. They don't have the mini games and storyline like 7 had.
[2022-12-16 06:33:39] <+twin_blade_kirito> maxy ever played any camalot games
[2022-12-16 06:33:48] <gMilk> hello maxy, hello frends wideVIBE
[2022-12-16 06:33:56] <InfinityArts> Rather, it's too little monies.

[2022-12-16 06:34:29] <%+DrBovice> @Silverpslm they have the marble games in village
[2022-12-16 06:34:45] <%+DrBovice> thats kind of a mini game?
[2022-12-16 06:35:29] <+twangl> ring ring ring ring ring ring ring.. BANANAPHONE
[2022-12-16 06:35:45] <+Silverpslm> 7 had the storylines of the other survivors like the escape room, or the card game
[2022-12-16 06:35:52] <%+TheSanctusNex> Or maybe the light puzzles?
[2022-12-16 06:36:20] <TrinityThatcher> @the_aerial_ace Like Tommy Tallerico if he was way, way worse of a human being and less successful 🤣🤣🤣
[2022-12-16 06:36:49] <+Silverpslm> 8s storyline was amazing, but what side stories could they make?
[2022-12-16 06:38:22] <s09negan> we had resistance  xD
[2022-12-16 06:38:28] <kei_77> RE3 got resistane
[2022-12-16 06:38:37] <+Silverpslm> Like what the town villagers did when the outbreak started. Or when the women were kidnapped and turned into monster
[2022-12-16 06:38:58] <kei_77> It was a free pack-in
[2022-12-16 06:39:27] <%Silverwolf32> and RE3 Remake suffered for that free game as well
[2022-12-16 06:39:29] <kei_77> But the whole game wasn't dev 1 LUL
[2022-12-16 06:39:35] <s09negan> re:verse made me question capcom
[2022-12-16 06:40:03] <kei_77> RE3 was made by some weird Platinum Games ex-employee team
[2022-12-16 06:40:44] <+Silverpslm> speaking of which, whats the deal with Kotor 2 for switch still not getting its DLC?

[2022-12-16 06:41:41] <Solghettoguy> that just sounds baseless to say
[2022-12-16 06:41:50] <+Silverpslm> @zer0cious pong?
[2022-12-16 06:41:58] <+nyuk00> everyone calling reverse free but I clearly paid for it when I bought RE Village
[2022-12-16 06:42:02] <kei_77> I wonder why it took them like 2 years to release it past the original date though

[2022-12-16 06:42:14] <s09negan> why would  they greenlight it, advertising it along with re8.  Held it back a year and it still feels unfinished
[2022-12-16 06:42:14] <+Silverpslm> @nyuk00 true
[2022-12-16 06:42:15] <youstink457> I think it's nap time for me
[2022-12-16 06:42:32] <+twangl> re7 seemed more fertile for dlc because of the storytelling method IMO. left more questions than answers at the end

[2022-12-16 06:44:08] <Solghettoguy> get this one item you really want and get this "free" DVD you never want to touch your player LUL
[2022-12-16 06:44:27] <kei_77> I beat Village once and uninstalled. This game was super underwhelming imo.
[2022-12-16 06:44:28] <imthedallywacker> Whats up man? Hows your night going?
[2022-12-16 06:44:37] <Solghettoguy> it was ok
[2022-12-16 06:44:40] <Fatalkill3r> Dead by daylight irritates me
[2022-12-16 06:44:41] <%$RedBoxPhen> CatInABox <3
[2022-12-16 06:44:44] <Solghettoguy> nothing to get hooked on
[2022-12-16 06:44:56] <Sasam> even in board games there's a lot of people who just randomly gravitate to asymmetrical games... Though that's mostly Root's fault
[2022-12-16 06:45:05] <+twangl> this is NOTHING like fortnite PepegaAim
[2022-12-16 06:45:05] <s09negan> ok ok ok , i guess re verse not as bad as umbrella corp? lol
[2022-12-16 06:45:16] <+Silverpslm> I loved Village for its retelling of classic monster troupes
[2022-12-16 06:45:17] <Fatalkill3r> I love the game but it gets on my nerves
[2022-12-16 06:45:27] <youstink457> I played dead by day light once and it was so boring
[2022-12-16 06:45:40] <%+IAMBIGBOY> r u sure it dead by daylight isnt like daylight by dead? maxyySmile
[2022-12-16 06:45:45] <%tyzula__> Dbd imo is only fun with friends
[2022-12-16 06:45:53] <+Shimoroku> I love holding left click and running around a wall
[2022-12-16 06:46:09] <Sasam> I found a single player indie games that's dead by daylight
[2022-12-16 06:46:15] <+Hellblazer_Hawkman> I'm being called out BibleThump
[2022-12-16 06:46:19] <kei_77> Sounds a lot like MMO players LUL
[2022-12-16 06:46:26] <loose_tongue> So your not playing Killer Clowns benvanLaugh
[2022-12-16 06:46:30] <lord_frieza666> Like Evil dead the game
[2022-12-16 06:46:35] <%Onyxian> I love how DBD was like my 3rd time category on Twitch but I don't even like that game. Bawk and Bee just played a ton of it for a while.
[2022-12-16 06:46:52] <+Silverpslm> Once you find the perfect game for you, what's the need
[2022-12-16 06:46:53] <+twangl> isn't all horror asymmetrical if it ends up actually being frightening?
[2022-12-16 06:46:55] <%+IAMBIGBOY> @Hellblazer_Hawkman baomoteBongo baomoteBongo baomoteBongo baomoteBongo
[2022-12-16 06:47:27] <kei_77> I think it's more they want the same feeling DBD gave them when they got hooked.
[2022-12-16 06:47:34] <gerikuso> dead by daylight isnt enough like Evolve
[2022-12-16 06:47:43] <%+IAMBIGBOY> @twangl baomoteModcheck baomoteModcheck baomoteModcheck
[2022-12-16 06:47:51] <+J_dabody> what do you mean by asymmetrical in terms of videogames
[2022-12-16 06:47:58] <mashtriangle> I’m praying that texas chain saw has SOME longevity
[2022-12-16 06:48:02] <youstink457> I don't know how people are still playing dead by daylight
[2022-12-16 06:48:03] <kei_77> @J_dabody Like 4v1
[2022-12-16 06:48:07] <%+IAMBIGBOY> did u mod the merchant? LUL
[2022-12-16 06:48:08] <mkgdx> lol, that damn smile
[2022-12-16 06:48:12] <+frozenchops> friday the 13th was better than dbd
[2022-12-16 06:48:12] <+Silverpslm> Reminds me of God of Wars hack n slash mechanic, and the games that mimicked it
[2022-12-16 06:48:25] <+J_dabody> ahh i misunderstood
[2022-12-16 06:48:41] <TrinityThatcher> Why play DBD when we could all be playing Friday the 13th? 🤣🤣🤣🤣
[2022-12-16 06:48:51] <Sasam> that prop hunt dead by daylight clone
[2022-12-16 06:49:15] <+JeepWillys78> Anyone heard anything about the merchant being playable as a character in re4 remake Mercenaries?
[2022-12-16 06:49:23] <+J_dabody> well what did DBD do to create such a monopoly
[2022-12-16 06:49:26] <triplefracture> does the re8 story make sense, in terms of things being explained by umbrella and bioweapons?  or is it more fantastical than others
[2022-12-16 06:49:42] <+J_dabody> sounds about right
[2022-12-16 06:49:46] <vecquity> Would you play DBD if Charles became a killer?
[2022-12-16 06:49:46] <KeyInk> Sometimes being first is all you need
[2022-12-16 06:49:47] <@%Bittie> Not really... Evolve was first technically
[2022-12-16 06:49:49] <+Hellblazer_Hawkman> Yeah, it's just a time thing. Hard to drop a game you've been playing since 2015
[2022-12-16 06:49:55] <@%Bittie> it wasnt horror though
[2022-12-16 06:50:01] <+twangl> @IAMBIGBOY BatChest
[2022-12-16 06:50:01] <%Hiyugen> i liked the friday the 13th one best
[2022-12-16 06:50:16] <InfinityArts> DBD devs have been doing it for a while, surely they've harnessed some secret.
[2022-12-16 06:50:17] <lokilasher_> If you're not first, you're last.
[2022-12-16 06:50:20] <kei_77> DBD was the first slasher coming for you kind of game and has great OG designs for the killers.
[2022-12-16 06:50:23] <mashtriangle> dbd also incorporates a ton of other horror IPs and therefore has endless longevity
[2022-12-16 06:50:23] <Sasam> you could say those other games... had their limelight then died by daylight nubbLisa
[2022-12-16 06:50:32] <+phunkking> god i never noticed the barons teeth are so...wrong
[2022-12-16 06:50:37] <@%+Piccolo113> Evolve feels like it wanted to be a Predator game, only they couldn't legally do that and also wanted different monsters that would change form.
[2022-12-16 06:50:42] <triplefracture> what was wrong with evolve?
[2022-12-16 06:50:42] <SomethingBarbaric> evolves devs are the reason evolve isn't still around.
[2022-12-16 06:50:45] <sleepongoldfish> its like phasmophobia and ghost hunting game people are like weeel phasmo did that and that
[2022-12-16 06:50:47] <loose_tongue> Wasn't Evolve TR also
[2022-12-16 06:51:17] <+Silverpslm> If I could make a dead by daylight knockoff....I'd make a Burger King one. Where you find and give them Burgers as the creepy King guy. What are other good examples?
[2022-12-16 06:51:23] <@%+Piccolo113> @triplefracture Not enough to keep people interested, and also became centered around a cash shop.
[2022-12-16 06:51:51] <mashtriangle> asymms are successful based on their content potential, so games like evil dead will eventually dry out, etc
[2022-12-16 06:51:56] <kei_77> The only downfall of DBD is they are so stagnant. They cannot evolve at all. The game still looks ugly as sin, has hackers all around, and game breaking bugs every new patch.
[2022-12-16 06:51:58] <triplefracture> @Piccolo113 roger that.  i loved watching it at first
[2022-12-16 06:52:26] <@%+Piccolo113> @triplefracture Yeah, it was fun watchin people stream it. I never felt the urge to play it myself, though.

[2022-12-16 07:05:00] <youstink457> do you reckon RE5R could happen or not
[2022-12-16 07:05:04] <+TeamMickMac> People would revolt if they RE3R'd RE4R :'(
[2022-12-16 07:05:10] <InfinityArts> Even without RE2Make and RE3Make, imagine the backlash if they fuck up remaking one of the genre defining games of the generation.
[2022-12-16 07:05:25] <loose_tongue> I know off topic but was there any news on the RoboCop game at the GA?

[2022-12-16 07:27:39] <%+IAMBIGBOY> NOPERS
[2022-12-16 07:27:42] <kei_77> !da
[2022-12-16 07:27:42] <@%^StreamElements> DA = Difficulty Adjustement, which means the game is going to slightly adjust the overall difficulty of the game based on your performance. An example is lowering accuracy and taking damage in Resident Evil 4 on Normal difficulty. Another is quitting and continuing at the start of Silent Hill 4.
[2022-12-16 07:27:51] <Alpha_24> 2nd scenario

[2022-12-16 07:53:32] <%+scopen> re3 og as well is hard imo
[2022-12-16 07:53:44] <%+scopen> but thats just due to rng so u really have no control over it
[2022-12-16 07:53:48] <+TeamMickMac> RE4 is insane. I've tried running it. Even though I did well overall, my time was trash compared to top players. All small things add up it seems

[2022-12-16 07:59:38] <realvioletgreen> when it comes out
[2022-12-16 07:59:43] <+MagatsuDante> CVX glitchless maybe
[2022-12-16 07:59:59] <+MagatsuDante> but with the ammo glitch yeah it's definitely on par with each other

[2022-12-16 08:06:33] <rycka545> ever did evil within speedyrun?
[2022-12-16 08:06:42] <+DragonMZ> Its amazing how every souls clone is mid at best
[2022-12-16 08:07:20] <+illust_rate> disagree, nioh is great
[2022-12-16 08:07:21] <+TeamMickMac> Nioh is good
[2022-12-16 08:07:29] <+TheUnsungLegion> I thought The Surge games were good I really liked the modular nature of the combat and equipment
[2022-12-16 08:07:37] <+LondolianMonstah> Nioh isn't really a souls clone tho tbh
[2022-12-16 08:07:40] <+DragonMZ> Nioh is amazing but I think its far enough removed from being a Clone
[2022-12-16 08:07:49] <+TeamMickMac> It's much more it's own thing than it is a Souls-like, yes.
[2022-12-16 08:07:49] <4D_Hypersphere> Some of the 2D ones are decent like Salt&Sanctuary. Not sure if that even counts as a clone though given, yaknow, 2D.
[2022-12-16 08:07:55] <FoilsArt_> nioh isnt souls like
[2022-12-16 08:07:58] <+illust_rate> fair enough
[2022-12-16 08:08:11] <+illust_rate> if we're not counting nioh then yeah you're right
[2022-12-16 08:08:19] <+stubby_nub> i have been pretty bored with the past couple gdq's. for some reason they turn the classic games into 4 man races and dont feature a lot of games that seem to have been typically featured or are actually compelling or interesting
[2022-12-16 08:08:27] <rycka545> one of the unpopular but best of souls clones is deffinetely sinner and sacrifice
[2022-12-16 08:08:45] <+DragonMZ> I enjoyed Code Vein
[2022-12-16 08:08:56] <+DragonMZ> but it has its issues
[2022-12-16 08:08:58] <+TheUnsungLegion> code vein was fun
[2022-12-16 08:09:05] <%Lskey_> 321 321 321
[2022-12-16 08:09:07] <%Onyxian> is this the rgb rgb rgb one?
[2022-12-16 08:09:15] <SteveChopz> I only know of Salt & Sacrifice which was the sequel to Salt & Sanctuary
[2022-12-16 08:09:24] <taichou_bread> Code Vein was nice af jigzDab
[2022-12-16 08:09:25] <%SlimRothlisbrgr> I love this game Re2 was always my fave and the remake is great too
[2022-12-16 08:09:27] <rycka545> nah man its not 2d its kinda like only boss battles games no regular enemies but is really underated
[2022-12-16 08:09:29] <+JustJoeBear> there's a soulslike with guns called Remnant, i enjoyed that one.
[2022-12-16 08:09:36] <%Onyxian> ah maxyyPaw
[2022-12-16 08:09:38] <e_manh> You're doing really good Maxy
[2022-12-16 08:09:51] <+TheUnsungLegion> I'm actually playing through Remnant lol
[2022-12-16 08:10:01] <FoilsArt_> I love reamant
[2022-12-16 08:10:04] <rycka545> misspeled its name its sinner sacrifice for redemption my bad
[2022-12-16 08:10:11] <taichou_bread> 2 cant wait!
[2022-12-16 08:10:13] <4D_Hypersphere> Remnant is pretty different from Souls at least. For one, no 'souls'.
[2022-12-16 08:10:23] <+LondolianMonstah> Remnant is so good
[2022-12-16 08:10:27] <e_manh> I hear Marvel's Midnight Suns is pretty good for a turn-based RPG game.
[2022-12-16 08:10:29] <%+Booty_Satan> any love for monster hunter?
[2022-12-16 08:10:35] <rycka545> also jedi fallen order was good if youre jedi fan

[2022-12-16 08:11:05] <+MeechanZ> I wonder how many weps from remnant 1 will return in remnant 2
[2022-12-16 08:11:08] <%MetalWaldo> @e_manh I forgot that came out
[2022-12-16 08:11:16] <+TheUnsungLegion> hmm it definatly has souls elements
[2022-12-16 08:11:27] <%Onyxian> Man Runebee played that Midnight Suns game for like 8 days
[2022-12-16 08:11:29] <lokilasher_> Way too easy to be soulslike.
[2022-12-16 08:11:32] <e_manh> I'm surprised Shredder's Revenge didn't win any awards.
[2022-12-16 08:11:38] <rycka545> it kinda was closest we get to jedi souls lol game was more like sekiro stuff
[2022-12-16 08:11:59] <+stubby_nub> tetris.... now that is a souls like game

[2022-12-16 08:56:00] <%Silverwolf32> What was the best looking Gamecube game?
[2022-12-16 08:56:02] <+jayzed2850> Doing good @catsblazing just trying to knock out some Ethan Must Die speedruns for RE7
[2022-12-16 08:56:08] <nGsJason> TO BE FAIR, this is a remaster of this game isn't it?
[2022-12-16 08:56:12] <turlte1> Yeah RE4 and 5 look good to this day
[2022-12-16 08:56:12] <nGsJason> iirc
[2022-12-16 08:56:17] <lucid2cents> Sturdy console too shelld6Maxthatboi
[2022-12-16 08:56:20] <%+hntd187> actually the gamecube was nintendo's last actualy very innovative hardware system
[2022-12-16 08:56:33] <%+hntd187> n64 was way ahead of it's time for it's capabilities
[2022-12-16 08:56:37] <nGsJason> ^The WiiU i would say was too
[2022-12-16 08:56:46] <+H0stil1ty> I was weird I played RE1R, RE0 and animal crossing on my gamecube
[2022-12-16 08:56:56] <turlte1> And Dino Crisis is also hella fun for many game aesthetics
[2022-12-16 08:57:03] <%Silverwolf32> oh I remember my first day with the Wii U, played Zombie U
[2022-12-16 08:57:08] <%Zeph43> I liked the gamecube because the discs were cute FeelsOkayMan
[2022-12-16 08:57:27] <%Zeph43> I got my sister a wii u for christmas and I'm pretty sure she only played it twice FeelsBadMan
[2022-12-16 08:57:40] <nGsJason> WiiU was a pretty cool system, just did not sell well
[2022-12-16 08:57:47] <nGsJason> and it was decently powerful iirc
[2022-12-16 08:58:07] <catsblazing> @jayzed2850 gl on that
[2022-12-16 08:58:08] <+OddyQuinn> Twilight Princess looked good af on GC
[2022-12-16 08:58:11] <%+AnimatedElf> wait Twilight Princess was on the Game Cube?
[2022-12-16 08:58:18] <%+AnimatedElf> I thought it was Wii
[2022-12-16 08:58:21] <%+AnimatedElf> boxO
[2022-12-16 08:58:22] <nGsJason> yeah
[2022-12-16 08:58:23] <+jayzed2850> Yeah GC and Wii
[2022-12-16 08:58:29] <nGsJason> both
[2022-12-16 08:58:29] <%Silverwolf32> I need to replay Twilight Princess, been awhile
[2022-12-16 08:58:31] <+OddyQuinn> It released on both GC and Wii but it was made with GC in mind
[2022-12-16 08:58:35] <nGsJason> i think Wii came out first iirc?
[2022-12-16 08:58:42] <%+AnimatedElf> okay I was like am I having a fucking crisis
[2022-12-16 08:58:54] <+OddyQuinn> Wii came out a month before GC, but the game was developed for GC
[2022-12-16 08:58:58] <+jayzed2850> Wii version was mirrored entirely to make Link right handed
[2022-12-16 08:59:01] <%+AnimatedElf> I played that shit on wii 100

[2022-12-16 08:59:33] <nGsJason> yeah i was almost certain it was on two different release dates, and iirc, LoZ TP was also mirrored on Wii wasn't it?
[2022-12-16 08:59:54] <%+AnimatedElf> yeah so "players could use the motion controls easier"
[2022-12-16 09:00:03] <%+AnimatedElf> since more people are right handed
[2022-12-16 09:00:23] <+jayzed2850> They took the only left handed icon in gaming
[2022-12-16 09:00:24] <+OddyQuinn> Moreso just so it made more sense, because swinging the wiimote with your right hand and having link swing the sword in his left hand would be weird
[2022-12-16 09:00:36] <nGsJason> i just remembered it mostly for being mirrored AND it came out before GC
[2022-12-16 09:00:45] <%+AnimatedElf> yeah
[2022-12-16 09:00:46] <%oryaj_archives> is this the first tyrant ever

[2022-12-16 09:03:13] <%+AnimatedElf> HOLY SHIT THANK YOU. SOMEONE ELSE FINALLY KNOWS WHAT THE EYE TOY IS I WAS LITERALLY HAVING A CRISIS OVER THIS THINKING I DREAMT IT UP
[2022-12-16 09:03:23] <+OddyQuinn> It sucks that there are a lot of good games on Wii, Wii U, DS, and 3DS, but because of the nature of the platforms, a lot of them may never get re-released on other platforms
[2022-12-16 09:03:37] <DreaMSavior> people always want to try something new

[2022-12-16 09:04:14] <lucid2cents> Biggest winners on the Wii were dads who played Tiger Woods PGA Tour with the Wii more
[2022-12-16 09:04:18] <nGsJason> unironically the PS Move is the one i think did not get good treatment at all lol

[2022-12-16 09:05:08] <%+RaziWraith> Too late. I've already called Miyamoto and provided him your IP.
[2022-12-16 09:05:10] <+OddyQuinn> No definitely, the Wii and DS were excellent systems with some amazing games, but both were overly bloated by shovelware titles, and even really bad first-party titles that pointlessly used motion and touch
[2022-12-16 09:05:11] <nGsJason> The PS Eye and the PS Move both felt super useless on PS. You literally got better versions of both with Kinect and Wii LUL
[2022-12-16 09:05:52] <andre93a> well it's true tbh
[2022-12-16 09:06:03] <%+RaziWraith> I actually skipped Wii and went to the WiiU

[2022-12-16 09:06:37] <nGsJason> I don't regret WiiU, Wind Waker HD was great

[2022-12-16 09:06:54] <nGsJason> the WiiU also got Fatal Frame 5
[2022-12-16 09:07:21] <%+AnimatedElf> Smash 4 was on the Wii U
[2022-12-16 09:07:22] <e_manh> Pokemon, Fire Emblem and Ace Attorney games are so great.
[2022-12-16 09:07:26] <andre93a> I can't wait for Metroid Prime games for the Switch
[2022-12-16 09:07:42] <e_manh> Smash 4 was on both Wii U and 3DS.
[2022-12-16 09:07:54] <+DilDaleOrthGasm> you know it cant be a good ssign when your games come in at the bargain bin of CVS
[2022-12-16 09:07:56] <nGsJason> 3DS version of smash 4 felt bad tho
[2022-12-16 09:08:26] <%+AnimatedElf> if you played Smash 4 on the 3DS you just told this whole chat your sexual preferences. Masochism.
[2022-12-16 09:08:39] <e_manh> I never got Smash 4.

[2022-12-16 09:09:45] <%Silverwolf32> I miss Radio Shack
[2022-12-16 09:09:49] <%+AnimatedElf> one of those bins is where I got the Viva Piñata game for Xbox 360

[2022-12-16 09:11:09] <%Necrofitz> I worked in a Radio Shack. It was garbage.
[2022-12-16 09:11:09] <%+Booty_Satan> it was like a worse best buy
[2022-12-16 09:11:10] <nGsJason> radio shack was cool for like things for learning to build circuits and stuff
[2022-12-16 09:11:11] <lucid2cents> They were more the store you drove by lol
[2022-12-16 09:11:12] <+H0stil1ty> imagine a small frys electronics
[2022-12-16 09:11:12] <%+Booty_Satan> but for nerds
[2022-12-16 09:11:15] <nGsJason> just other electronics
[2022-12-16 09:11:20] <%MetalWaldo> My brother worked at the Radio Shack here until it closed down
[2022-12-16 09:11:22] <MacMakoShark> It’s like stepping into worse best buy
[2022-12-16 09:11:23] <e_manh> Radio Shack wasn't all that cool.
[2022-12-16 09:11:26] <dark_zero111> it was like a mini fridge full of electronics
[2022-12-16 09:11:28] <%+RaziWraith> They are technically still around now, but less helpful or needed overall.
[2022-12-16 09:11:28] <lucid2cents> More likely to go inside a Circuit City back then
[2022-12-16 09:11:35] <+nehmetaniat> It's like steping into a store for cell phones, but instead for all kinds of other electronic stuff
[2022-12-16 09:11:38] <%+AnimatedElf> Imagine a Best Buy the size of a Mall Auntie Ann's booth, but with the same amount of things as the normal Best Buy

[2022-12-16 10:38:12] <%$kll21> so happy to not have anything planned for the holidays
[2022-12-16 10:38:38] <!ProtoTypeRaavyn> Also, they removed the Halloween candy from the store 2 days before Halloween this year and replaced it with Holiday candy and I thought that was extreme. I am sure someone left getting Trick or Treating candy until the last moment and then found out all they had was Xmas trees and candy canes.

[2022-12-16 10:58:46] <%Silverwolf32> I always loved the names of the enemies in this game
[2022-12-16 10:59:54] <dawut_berdiliyew0901> @silverwolf32 yeah all of them are Ukrainian Words
[2022-12-16 11:00:02] <Griimmerr> have you played Signalis?
[2022-12-16 11:00:04] <%Silverwolf32> cool
[2022-12-16 11:00:15] <%Silverwolf32> oh baby
[2022-12-16 11:00:20] <%Silverwolf32> suplex city
[2022-12-16 11:00:40] <mattfus2> But have you watched the six movies?
[2022-12-16 11:00:50] <uUlysses_> Signalis, that is a good game SoonerLater
[2022-12-16 11:00:59] <mattynocap> What re6 story line is your favorite
[2022-12-16 11:01:05] <%Necrofitz> Suplex City where Jake is the mayor and likes to spread the good word
[2022-12-16 11:01:07] <%Silverwolf32> Sherry modCheck
[2022-12-16 11:01:13] <dawut_berdiliyew0901> he's trying to be Leon
[2022-12-16 11:01:23] <!ProtoTypeRaavyn> I think you should Check out Undying. It's more wholesome than the regular games you play, but I have known you for long enough that I think you would actually like the uniqueness of the game
[2022-12-16 11:01:27] <%+YamaJuugo> i agree with that
[2022-12-16 11:01:43] <Griimmerr> I just wanted to know did you like it or not
[2022-12-16 11:01:45] <%Silverwolf32> I like Jake's back story and his character development
[2022-12-16 11:01:51] <uUlysses_> Ada
[2022-12-16 11:02:25] <dawut_berdiliyew0901> who knows his Secret Dodge animation from his 1v1 Boss fight against Ustanak
[2022-12-16 11:03:13] <dawut_berdiliyew0901> actually I love this concept of Resident Evil more than Horror Genre
[2022-12-16 11:03:27] <!ProtoTypeRaavyn> You as the main character ARE going to die, you have been bitten, you have a young son, evac will not be able to get to your son before you die, so it's a race to teach him what you can so he can survive as you start to deteriorate.
[2022-12-16 11:04:13] <%Silverwolf32> oh lord he coming
[2022-12-16 11:04:13] <dawut_berdiliyew0901> good old Ustanak
[2022-12-16 11:04:25] <!ProtoTypeRaavyn> So you get worse, as he gets better. A time and strategy game with zombie and escort elements. It's kinda a new take on all the old stuff.

[2022-12-16 11:20:25] <chartreusejoker> I will admit that the mullet immediately makes me assume you aren't very bright :(
[2022-12-16 11:20:25] <det_john_hobbs> leon has cool hair

[2022-12-16 11:43:15] <!ProtoTypeRaavyn> Well I think it was a slide or something, it's been years. like 2013
[2022-12-16 11:43:37] <!ProtoTypeRaavyn> So almost a decade, but it's singularly the only thing I remember from this game.

[2022-12-16 11:48:53] <+twin_blade_kirito> thats one of the dlc for re5
[2022-12-16 11:48:56] <!ProtoTypeRaavyn> Yeah one of them, but it is the one I am talking about
[2022-12-16 11:49:06] <%Zeph43> But now i remember that Kojima did that too, and mgsv came out after this monkaLSD
[2022-12-16 11:49:45] <karlem22> this game is wild wtf

[2022-12-16 11:54:30] <hobrev> this game is the best sequel John Woo's Stranglehold could have ever gotten
[2022-12-16 11:54:33] <ingogneeto> Is Jake's hand and combat is baller
[2022-12-16 11:54:37] <NotToast> lol that's so depressing.
[2022-12-16 11:55:04] <%Krabbykitty> Was it really?
[2022-12-16 11:55:24] <+luke_twentytwo> i played this co-op with my buddy when it came out and we both loved it. i had no idea it was so hated by the fandom until i started watching RE twitch streamers
[2022-12-16 11:55:25] <catsblazing> I don't like playing as Jake in this part I usually die a lot rawrF
[2022-12-16 11:55:32] <!ProtoTypeRaavyn> If it wasn't for this game leaning so far into the action, and people disliking it so much, we wouldn't of gotten the right turn into horrorland with RE7
[2022-12-16 11:56:16] <catsblazing> people just love multiplayer variety
[2022-12-16 11:56:27] <!ProtoTypeRaavyn> Sometime you gotta stumble to run.

[2022-12-16 11:57:52] <%Silverwolf32> I could only imagine what OG RE 7 would have been before that
[2022-12-16 11:58:19] <%Zeph43> Think how much better RE village would've been if Ethan backflipped over an apache smh NODDERS
[2022-12-16 11:58:20] <catsblazing> most people who loved re6 weren't previous re fans
[2022-12-16 11:58:29] <DwightyNight> wish more games were like silent hill origins ... just wanna throw TV's at everything lolol
[2022-12-16 11:58:44] <!ProtoTypeRaavyn> I dunno I will forever hate ORC, don't advertise the entire game as "Play as HUNK" and then give us whatever shit that game was.
[2022-12-16 12:01:35] <%Krabbykitty> This is a long run

[2022-12-16 12:16:30] <catsblazing> wesker left to buy cigarettes but took so long to get any that he forgot he had a son Keepo
[2022-12-16 12:16:30] <%Silverwolf32> Wesker may have kept tabs on Jake for all we know

[2022-12-16 12:25:19] <dawut_berdiliyew0901> the effort behind all those counter attack and melee animations do show that it's that way
[2022-12-16 12:25:20] <%+Marrickfait> Which is your favorite boss out of the 4 campaigns?

[2022-12-16 12:27:09] <+sharinganxghost> i see youre playing the best re game of all time lmao
[2022-12-16 12:27:43] <kei_77> Each campaign feels like 70% as long as a full game yea
[2022-12-16 12:27:50] <dawut_berdiliyew0901> I don't see that much care about martial arts honestly
[2022-12-16 12:27:54] <%+Marrickfait> That's so crazy that they put that much time in the game
[2022-12-16 12:28:24] <%Silverwolf32> and on top of that you get Mercenaries and such
[2022-12-16 12:28:43] <%+YamaJuugo> that time estimate with re7 sounds about right
[2022-12-16 12:28:46] <kei_77> I've gone through the whole game co-op twice and each playthrough was 20 hours
[2022-12-16 12:29:14] <%+Marrickfait> Looking at the WR for Chris' campaign, and it's over 2 hours. That's insane

[2022-12-16 12:31:22] <dawut_berdiliyew0901> and this boss fight's 1v1 part is my favorite of all time

[2022-12-16 12:38:51] <IcyGaming146> yes
[2022-12-16 12:38:54] <lHereticRamzal> the hate is mostly because its more action game than horror tho
[2022-12-16 12:38:59] <%Zeph43> is the chris campaign gonna be on the poll
[2022-12-16 12:39:00] <+ibringdeath2u> same with any game you can have fun in the right circumstance

[2022-12-16 12:39:06] <dawut_berdiliyew0901> I love RE4 first RE6 is 2nd
[2022-12-16 12:39:07] <%+YamaJuugo> it does get a lot of hate tbh
[2022-12-16 12:39:20] <kei_77> It's good now because back then we thought this would just be the norm for the series going forward @Maxylobes
[2022-12-16 12:39:26] <%+YamaJuugo> and I said it before, but I think the majority of people who hate on it havent even played it lol
[2022-12-16 12:39:36] <%+YamaJuugo> they just hate it because the internet says to
[2022-12-16 12:39:39] <lHereticRamzal> im one of the minorities who liked the game back then

[2022-12-16 12:40:44] <%+Marrickfait> @rycka545 the hate on RE7 on release was silly

[2022-12-16 12:40:57] <lHereticRamzal> im more suprised that Umbrella Corps was less hated than RE6 KEKWHD

[2022-12-16 12:42:52] <Sluvock> Joe fights those really bulky molded but they're effectively the same in that mode
[2022-12-16 12:43:21] <beingjustahooman> what are those
[2022-12-16 12:43:31] <+Draconis81> I feel like each entry has its own charm.
[2022-12-16 12:43:34] <silentoldboy> survivor 1 is masterpiece KEKW
[2022-12-16 12:43:35] <%+Marrickfait> My biggest grip with 6 is that enemies have too much HP lol

[2022-12-16 12:44:37] <kei_77> How is there no steam version for the Chronicles games, at least put solo playable.
[2022-12-16 12:44:53] <%Silverwolf32> @lHereticRamzal it's not stated anywhere who she is

[2022-12-16 12:45:43] <+Draconis81> I feel like not having access to 1-3 og, on current platforms, is an issue.

[2022-12-16 12:46:19] <%+Marrickfait> RE2 and 3 OG on Steam would be awesome

[2022-12-16 12:46:34] <+ibringdeath2u> you know I enjoyed ORC back in the day rebuying it was a poor decision LUL

[2022-12-16 12:50:33] <%Silverwolf32> What, a game having built in Randomizers? PogChamp
[2022-12-16 12:50:35] <%+Marrickfait> Randomizers are cool. Hope to see devs take advantage of the idea more as time goes on
[2022-12-16 12:50:43] <+Draconis81> Those juicy roids
[2022-12-16 12:51:07] <Grognosh2> They should make a non randomised version for speedrunning competitions :D
[2022-12-16 12:51:59] <%+Marrickfait> that ceiling spike trap was such a sad death the first time through lol
[2022-12-16 12:52:05] <+ShahriarShiv> man it was such an eh year for games i really only like madison
[2022-12-16 12:52:07] <+Draconis81> Or they could just implement a way to play particular seeds
[2022-12-16 12:52:16] <+Draconis81> Similar to bloodborne chalice dungeons
[2022-12-16 12:52:36] <%+Marrickfait> LOL

[2022-12-16 12:52:51] <dawut_berdiliyew0901> well my latest playthrough of this was like 3 days ago and it was 21:58 not speedrun tho lol
[2022-12-16 12:52:51] <+ShahriarShiv> TRIPLE H POGGERS
[2022-12-16 12:52:53] <Saithiria> "ethan must drug himself"
[2022-12-16 12:52:59] <@%Sin_Dragon> ANY JUICERS
[2022-12-16 12:53:05] <Grognosh2> x
[2022-12-16 12:53:14] <+Draconis81> Ethan is juiced out of his mind
[2022-12-16 12:53:21] <+ibringdeath2u> after the stuff he have seen; I don't blame him
[2022-12-16 12:54:16] <lHereticRamzal> i wonder if ethan is immune to drugs considering he's molded
[2022-12-16 12:54:23] <lHereticRamzal> that makes me think hard
[2022-12-16 12:54:28] <+Draconis81> Interesting to realize that roids boost mold growth/reproduction… apparently.
[2022-12-16 12:54:31] <+TheUnsungLegion> this is the roid rage run
[2022-12-16 12:54:38] <Grognosh2> the auto shooting gun from Breaking bad Pog
[2022-12-16 12:54:47] <Grognosh2> and the trip mines from Half-Life POGGERS
[2022-12-16 12:54:58] <%+Marrickfait> That was close
[2022-12-16 12:55:10] <lHereticRamzal> steroids should've been a counter agent for molded right? since molds are known fungi to fight over each other
[2022-12-16 12:55:11] <dawut_berdiliyew0901> holy shit that was scary
