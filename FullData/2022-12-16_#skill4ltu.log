[2022-12-16 23:55:19] <nebvbn> It seems like they retracted some of the features from the new line, it keeps the normal gun only, but the premium keeps its derp :)
[2022-12-16 23:55:29] <infektologija> hey bro! u re a legend player
[2022-12-16 23:55:44] <!%yetiyetio> @nebvbn yup they completely removed all of the derps from the line
[2022-12-16 23:55:48] <!%yetiyetio> which is good

[2022-12-16 23:59:34] <%bellarchon> hey @skill4ltu ! can u give my any advice? im fairly new, and now feeling a bit desperate. like 2 weeks ago i really dont enjoy the game because there is no reward for starters. im feeling shit. anyone can shoot me from everywhere. if i camp, i can raerly farm tanks, if i go with heavy, they kill me anyway. if i try to spot, most of the time im killed early. theres is nothing the game offers if you are not good enough...
[2022-12-16 23:59:36] <aardappelsoepkommetje> still a nice game tho
