[2022-12-18 08:03:11] <void_kittens> got it wrong sorry
[2022-12-18 08:03:15] <void_kittens> One sneeze means people are saying good things about you; two sneezes in a row means people are saying bad things about you; three sneezes in a row is a sign that someone is in love with you or you may fall in love soon. Four or more sneezes mean a calamity will come upon the person or their family.
