[2022-12-19 11:43:05] <%PanicRush> this is just depressing
[2022-12-19 11:53:13] <%PanicRush> why do i have 360 ilvl peasants sign up for a +10?
[2022-12-19 11:53:22] <%PanicRush> go farm fucking m0s
[2022-12-19 11:56:34] <%PanicRush> oh jeez 397 dh
[2022-12-19 11:58:14] <%Swiggyswoo_> 360 is aight enough for +10
[2022-12-19 11:59:17] <%PanicRush> if you know they are good and are in voice coordinating each other
[2022-12-19 11:59:29] <%PanicRush> i dont trust a random pug

[2022-12-19 12:41:01] <%JurgenRapp> Stupid question but in what way does the reset affect the rwf, is it server downtime or does it change anything?
[2022-12-19 12:42:20] <%Taylor131313> whoever kills the boss first wins, regardless of different downtimes
[2022-12-19 12:47:17] <%JurgenRapp> yeah but the problem with the reset is server downtime?
[2022-12-19 12:47:41] <%JurgenRapp> You can't pull during the reset
[2022-12-19 12:48:39] <%JurgenRapp> so optimally you would like to have the reset when you sleep and not during active hours

[2022-12-19 14:48:18] <%Taylor131313> gonna be nerfed to death once RWF is over
[2022-12-19 14:48:40] <%JurgenRapp> oh that's how it works
[2022-12-19 14:50:09] <%JurgenRapp> it was really fun to watch yesterday when they were so close
[2022-12-19 14:50:29] <%JurgenRapp> if one team is way ahead it's kinda boring
[2022-12-19 14:51:49] <%Taylor131313> it's not dying this reset anyway
[2022-12-19 14:51:55] <%Taylor131313> neither team made it out of phase 1 yet
[2022-12-19 14:52:04] <%JurgenRapp> but also I would really like to see AI play and see what strats it will come up with
[2022-12-19 14:57:17] <%JurgenRapp> the reset is in 1d 14h for EU and you don't think echo will kill 8 before that?
[2022-12-19 14:58:51] <%JurgenRapp> 76% 26 pulls
[2022-12-19 14:59:55] <%JurgenRapp> Liquid at 70%
[2022-12-19 15:00:04] <%JurgenRapp> perhaps there is a long way to go then
[2022-12-19 15:05:09] <%Taylor131313> the hardest phases are yet to come, no chance they kill it with only 1 more day of progression
[2022-12-19 15:30:54] <%JurgenRapp> ok
[2022-12-19 15:38:13] <%Wardrick7> hopefully later phases wont be easy with bonus reset gear so that its not killed just after reset

[2022-12-19 16:15:14] <%Taylor131313> Liquid unironically thinks they can win the race against Naowh, a man who has a daily intake of 450 grams of pure lean protein feeding his bulging muscles and 200 billion brain neurons. The electricity this man generates from perfectly executing his rotation with a 100% uptime is enough to power the whole echo facility. What does Liquid have? Trill? Dont make me laugh.

[2022-12-19 21:05:19] <%JurgenRapp> pay $20 extra to play 4 days before people who won't pay to get a headstart. pay $30 to unlock 20 tiers, pay $1000 and we unlock all achievements so you don't even have to play our game! What the heck is going on with games.
[2022-12-19 21:05:48] <%PanicRush> i missed the start of this convo, is this about some battle pass?

[2022-12-19 21:23:20] <%Teno20> Wait, is that actually a thing? Paying to unlock achievements?
[2022-12-19 21:23:41] <%JurgenRapp> no but it's just the next logical step :)
[2022-12-19 21:24:15] <%JurgenRapp> if you can pay so you don't have to play to unlock stuff why not the same for achivements
[2022-12-19 21:26:22] <%JurgenRapp> but it's a $70 game and they instantly want you to buy a Premium Seasonal Battle Pass  WeirdChamp
[2022-12-19 21:27:23] <%Makkan780> ye gaming have really gone to shit the past 10 years
[2022-12-19 21:27:29] <%Makkan780> it sucks
[2022-12-19 21:32:18] <%Collnaris> most battle passes these days let you pay for levels to unlock stuff.
[2022-12-19 21:33:02] <%Makkan780> most of those are in free games
[2022-12-19 21:33:06] <%Makkan780> big differance
[2022-12-19 21:33:50] <%Collnaris> Happens in CoD and pretty much every shooter regardless if you pay for the game
[2022-12-19 21:34:15] <%Makkan780> ye its sad
[2022-12-19 21:34:37] <%JurgenRapp> For me this kinda sets the tone for D4, but D3 was a disaster at launch and they fixed it so I guess not all hope is lost
[2022-12-19 21:34:49] <%Collnaris> what's really dumb is that people actually dish out big money for it
[2022-12-19 21:35:10] <%Makkan780> i like D3 better at launch
[2022-12-19 21:35:18] <%Makkan780> the RoS patch ruined the game
[2022-12-19 21:35:24] <%Makkan780> not trade etc sucked
[2022-12-19 21:36:13] <%JurgenRapp> Ok, I just felt it was broken when people find their items in the Auction house and not by playing the game
[2022-12-19 21:36:36] <%Makkan780> trading was always a big part of diablo
[2022-12-19 21:37:12] <%JurgenRapp> Yes I'm ok with that people have different opinions
[2022-12-19 21:37:21] <%Makkan780> removing the ah was fine but removing trading was just bad
[2022-12-19 21:37:44] <%JurgenRapp> Yeah but it was to get rid of the botting I guess?
[2022-12-19 21:38:42] <%Makkan780> ruining the game to get rid of botting is not a great plan
[2022-12-19 21:39:01] <%Makkan780> luckily poe is there for peoplethat like trading
[2022-12-19 21:39:15] <%JurgenRapp> Na they can just put up items which randomly drops for people to buy I guess
[2022-12-19 21:39:45] <%JurgenRapp> I mean it doesn't have to be player to player the house(blizzard) can just sell stuff
[2022-12-19 21:39:57] <%Makkan780> wat
[2022-12-19 21:40:03] <%Makkan780> that would be wird
[2022-12-19 21:40:06] <%Makkan780> wierd
[2022-12-19 21:40:52] <%JurgenRapp> if bot plays the game and sells stuff they find why not just randomly drop stuff to sell from they buyers perspective it wouldn't matter?
[2022-12-19 21:41:33] <%JurgenRapp> The buyer can't tell if it a item created by Blizzard or a botter found it and sells it?
[2022-12-19 21:41:51] <%JurgenRapp> same difference for the buyer?
[2022-12-19 21:42:41] <%Makkan780> are you talking about an AH pr actually trading with people now+
[2022-12-19 21:42:59] <%JurgenRapp> that's an AH thing
[2022-12-19 21:43:00] <%Makkan780> because with normal trading that would be a lot of work for blizzard
[2022-12-19 21:43:04] <%Makkan780> o
[2022-12-19 21:43:11] <%Makkan780> would still hate it
[2022-12-19 21:43:25] <%Makkan780> how would they decide on prices etc
[2022-12-19 21:43:36] <%Makkan780> would make the economy really wierd
[2022-12-19 21:44:11] <%Makkan780> and designing a game like that because of bots is just bad
[2022-12-19 21:44:28] <%Collnaris> ye, i prefer an economy dependent upon the players rather than the devs tbh
[2022-12-19 21:44:41] <%JurgenRapp> Yeah if POE have solved it it's clearly possible so yeah
[2022-12-19 21:44:59] <%Makkan780> poe have a lot of boting and RMT
[2022-12-19 21:45:17] <%Makkan780> but its still fun
[2022-12-19 21:46:11] <%Makkan780> not sayin gi like bots
[2022-12-19 21:46:19] <%JurgenRapp> I seems more fun than D3 because there is more endgame
[2022-12-19 21:46:22] <%Makkan780> but you cant have free trading without there beign some boting
[2022-12-19 21:46:35] <%Makkan780> and i prefer to have free trading with some bots than restricted trading
[2022-12-19 21:46:41] <%JurgenRapp> fair enough
[2022-12-19 21:46:43] <%Makkan780> ye its great
[2022-12-19 21:47:13] <%Makkan780> will hopefully be less of a problem in D4 because of the price
[2022-12-19 21:47:49] <%JurgenRapp> The thing I didn't like with d3 was that i felt that people was playing the AH and not the game. So the drop rate was so low in the beginning so you basically had to
[2022-12-19 21:48:04] <%Makkan780> ye
[2022-12-19 21:48:07] <%Makkan780> i played the ah a lot
[2022-12-19 21:48:18] <%JurgenRapp> But maybe Blizzard took it too far the other way
[2022-12-19 21:48:37] <%JurgenRapp> But when i played POE i play SSF
[2022-12-19 21:48:55] <%Makkan780> i have played that a bit and can also be really fun
[2022-12-19 21:49:04] <%JurgenRapp> so I don't know that's just how I like to play the game so it's great that they have both options open
[2022-12-19 21:49:18] <%Makkan780> yep
[2022-12-19 21:49:38] <%Makkan780> would ber great if D4 did something similar
[2022-12-19 21:49:51] <%Makkan780> but i would not want the AH back
[2022-12-19 21:49:56] <%Makkan780> just being able to trade
[2022-12-19 21:50:31] <%Makkan780> and i think d4 is looking ok for that
[2022-12-19 21:50:36] <%JurgenRapp> one thing I miss in D3 is that you don't have create a build based on what you find because you know you will always find everything before long
[2022-12-19 21:50:36] <%Makkan780> but some item wont be tradable
[2022-12-19 21:51:27] <%JurgenRapp> I think it would be kinda cool if you had to make a build more around the items you find
[2022-12-19 21:51:52] <%Makkan780> ye than can be really cool
[2022-12-19 21:54:10] <%Taylor131313> liquid's caster group literally went ignore all mechanics on tree boss in +20 academy and just burned it peepoWTF

[2022-12-19 21:55:47] <%+Chryterion> Impressive
[2022-12-19 21:56:28] <%Taylor131313> they also timed ruby cringe pools 20
[2022-12-19 21:57:54] <%PanicRush> i refuse to believe it is possible
[2022-12-19 22:00:43] <%Taylor131313> then again if some of the best players in the world with the best gear now barely time it, it means it's incredibly overtuned
