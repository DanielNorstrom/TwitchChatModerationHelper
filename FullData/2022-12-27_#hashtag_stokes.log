[2022-12-27 12:30:08] <+Arteta_ball> United need vlahovic
[2022-12-27 12:30:08] <DM_XI> Buying Gakpo with Sancho, Rashford and Garnacho would be mental when you don't have a proper ST
[2022-12-27 12:30:11] <chewablealarm> Felix probably got paid fat stacks at Athleti set himself for life in just 4 years incase of a career ending injury
[2022-12-27 12:30:13] <%+winterhill1> if united win tonight they will have won 7 home games in a row for first time since 2017 under mourinho
[2022-12-27 12:30:13] <+candylover95> Sancho has been a disaster so far and Gakpo is slowly turning into a ST. Huge loss for us. Especially for 40 mill...
[2022-12-27 12:30:13] VIEWERS: 925
[2022-12-27 12:30:32] <%+tunined> Gakpo's best asset is his crossing not his finishing
[2022-12-27 12:30:37] <%+aj_1094> Risk of shifting Rash central is if he gets injured then there's no backup

[2022-12-27 12:39:45] <%bainer2788> Stokes you never thought about having a content account where you build a team trialling all the new players and rating them
[2022-12-27 12:39:50] <+frasskid> @joshibet06 ok thanks. makes sense
[2022-12-27 12:40:04] <madiggh> mid cantona or rb ronaldo
[2022-12-27 12:40:05] <!%jaarvx> @nymach I get that but under his circumstances the fact that he‚Äôs getting himself into these scoring opportunities is more important in the short term. Just my opinion though of course. Can be judged fully next season.

[2022-12-27 14:09:15] <lucas33305> Would be a good signing for United but they need a more rootless striker
[2022-12-27 14:09:19] <+heps92> He‚Äôs a bit of a walker but he‚Äôs got quality
[2022-12-27 14:09:25] <!%+acluvsufan> @callumn17 Yh but he went to your club pottenham
[2022-12-27 14:09:27] <xeardzz> Kloop in Jan is normally right
[2022-12-27 14:09:27] <@%+JSharpp> What is funny
[2022-12-27 14:09:28] <+xRandy_Marsh> Gakpo going to witness the Darwin comedy show from the bench
[2022-12-27 14:09:30] <%+MajesticU47> Gakpo long term injury incoming?
[2022-12-27 14:09:35] <%NikTheQuick96> gakpos best position is LW and you got Rashford there who is clear.. think you are good if you sign a proper 9

[2022-12-27 14:09:45] <%$shaquille_oatmeal110> Stokes how does sancho compare to IF NEY
[2022-12-27 14:09:45] <@%+JSharpp> Gakpo is top of assists and top of goals in Eredivisie and cost ¬£40m
[2022-12-27 14:09:49] <+imdvniel> hey bro
[2022-12-27 14:09:50] <%+DaveBling> Sunak asked a man at the shelter what business is he in and if Business is something that interests him... The man replied 'I just wanna get through today'
[2022-12-27 14:09:53] <@%+JSharpp> You chucked ¬£100m at Antony who scored like three goals
[2022-12-27 14:09:58] <+Jhaytch1> Diaz and jota should start ahead of punez and gakpo
[2022-12-27 14:09:59] <coreKING> dalot wc or walker gold?

[2022-12-27 14:10:43] <nxmi98> If Mane didn‚Äôt leave we‚Äôd be set but we‚Äôve got that extra attacker now and it will be good for Diaz because he was so good as rotation player

[2022-12-27 14:37:43] <+psesh> Gakpo is a modern striker like firmino. Amazing link up play and pressing
[2022-12-27 14:37:51] <+tommyyrawr> Is 442(2) used at all in pro play?
[2022-12-27 14:37:53] <TiReRR> @mgibson2004 did they give you him tradeable or untradeable?
[2022-12-27 14:37:54] <hellowhat86> toney or osimhen would be lit imo

[2022-12-27 14:46:24] <ThirdSubstitute> @psesh Gakpo has almost exclusively played on the left wing his whole career, and I think literally only one game at a striker for the Dutch team

[2022-12-27 14:46:35] <jabs_dell> @psesh he will be a lw that will drift into the am position, like what ox tried to do yesterday and nunez will do the channel running down the left. Idk what that means for diaz but that looks like the plan
