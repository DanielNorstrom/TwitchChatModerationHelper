[2023-01-02 12:56:16] <%+Lord_F_RS> @This_Land most of them dont matter since thralls ignore defense, as long as the can hit you are good to go. most of the ppl go for mage or range since they can attack from a distance.

[2023-01-02 15:43:23] <+GayForMoIeman> Also the whole game is balanced around rune alchables lol
[2023-01-02 15:43:23] <rukia__kuchiki> invention is horrible skill
[2023-01-02 15:43:24] <shac20> no need for smithing rework if we have blast forge and giants foundy
[2023-01-02 15:43:25] <%avexxus_> and it added tons of new good gear
[2023-01-02 15:43:30] <%Senaeth> it only took RS3 7 years to rework

[2023-01-02 15:45:44] <%avexxus_> I like the idea of making sailing into a slayer style dungeon skill. each island could have unique monsters. might be cool
[2023-01-02 15:46:05] <Adelheim> The wife went online, time for duo tempoross? Pog

[2023-01-02 15:52:02] <+Oath_Z> it makes afk legit afk
[2023-01-02 15:52:02] <%+Marc0ric0> A breeding skill where you have a pet following you that gives you stats depending on his level. You can "sacrifice pet" for exp and repeat. Could work for Osrs

[2023-01-02 15:52:33] <%avexxus_> @sincorax we'd like to add a skill where you gather gold pieces from npc's or you create items of value you can sell. I think people would definitely vote for those lol

[2023-01-02 16:38:58] <reallybongs> im curious why you dont bring like 4 mantas to save some brews? every trio setup i see has them even for normies
[2023-01-02 16:39:02] <i_breakrules> @devvtm it boosts your odds 10% beyond their already highest percent when you get it. That's not bad
[2023-01-02 16:39:27] <devvtm> @i_breakrules thats not for signature rolls thats for regular loot.

[2023-01-02 16:40:46] <devvtm> @i_breakrules 10% would have been fair in my eyes if they applied that to signature rolls aswell
[2023-01-02 16:40:49] <i_breakrules> @devvtm no it's for uniques as well

[2023-01-02 16:41:28] <i_breakrules> the newspost literally says "The MVP bonus provides a 10% boost to regular loot and the chance of getting a unique drop."

[2023-01-02 16:41:47] <i_breakrules> read the newspost my man. It's quite clear

[2023-01-02 16:46:34] <i_breakrules> @brinkelbronkel it's a bit different from raids. In raids a purple rolls for the team and then it decides who to give it to. At Nex every person rolls separately so you can have multi item drops
[2023-01-02 16:46:36] <Develhuntr75> and no on tanks the cough
[2023-01-02 16:46:41] <Develhuntr75> no one*

[2023-01-02 16:47:04] <i_breakrules> your specific odds are Your dmg divided by total damage dealt to all npcs, divided by 43. And if you got mvp then multiply that by 1.1

[2023-01-02 17:11:15] <i_breakrules> @2Dewy your odds are your dmg divided by total dmg dealt to boss and minions, divided by 43. If you were mvp multiply by 1.1, every player rolls separately
[2023-01-02 17:11:31] <i_breakrules> that's why you can get multi item kills
