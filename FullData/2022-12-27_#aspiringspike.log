[2022-12-27 16:01:30] <@%$achesst> What is going on all you incredible Spikelings? I am your host, the best part of 2022 and your only hope for 2023 Aspiringspike and welcome to my Shark Typhoon. Today in the Typhoon we're going to continue our end of year jamboree with some Grixis Breach Shadow in modern! And if you all behave yourselves, I might even add in a Nicol Bolas for flavor later. So stay tuned to see if that happens and support the stream with a like, sub, comment, follow, bits, and a purchase from the Spikeling Store.

[2022-12-27 16:04:51] <%$Ocara115> I wonder if Breach could also be good in Murktide with DRC as a way to help fuel it. A couple seem very interesting
[2022-12-27 16:05:15] <paladin_11111> what about grinding station for the ban?
[2022-12-27 16:05:23] <galactuskev> Lurrus was Soo good partially because bauble.

[2022-12-27 16:37:16] <@%^MTGBot> Dear MTGO User AspiringSpike: I noticed your decklist does not contain the Magic: the Gathering card Arbor Dryad. To me, this is a grievous oversight that must be immediately rectified. Please add this card to your deck forthwith or I will be left with no recourse but to unfollow. Again, the card I am suggesting you add is Arbor Dryad. Thank You.

[2022-12-27 17:05:50] <sexy_andy> I mean I get you on the painless part, especially on the mountain, but most of the time if you've got swamp in play it won't  cast iteration , nor most of things found of iteration. Do you think an island could make it for an easier mana managment, or you value the swamp for termintes in blood moon matches?

[2022-12-27 17:12:07] <+rabidocelot918> Personally I'm not too happy with kroxa unless you have a discard outlet like pyromancer or ledger shredder, in a rakdos breach deck idk if we're playing pyromancer

[2022-12-27 18:13:16] <%+rabidocelot918> @mindgamearcade bauble is literally cents lol
[2022-12-27 18:13:25] <@%phuckingmagikal> @hmmyespanda Now you see why I suggested it. And think grixis over esper is the route to go. Theoretically, you can just get 2 DRC's out and only need to exile one card at a time for bauble, 3 is just free baubles to get a full hand.
[2022-12-27 18:13:25] <%+IzexD> @aspiringspike is there a really solid reason Grinding Breach is jeskai over say temur? i feel like the white splash for just teferi, which people are starting to cut down to 1 copy anyway could be better served as a green splash for wrenn, what do you think?
[2022-12-27 18:13:29] <MindGameArcade> ok a few months ago it was like 40 dollars my bad
[2022-12-27 18:13:33] <%$tenorca> bauble & manamorphose (though a bit less on that last one)
[2022-12-27 18:13:38] <samconsumespie> urza's bauble when
[2022-12-27 18:13:47] <%sunsetjaxon> Great I have 8 paper copies
[2022-12-27 18:13:47] <Emperor_Oppai> Breach just screams a reminder that Theros Beyond Death was a horribly designed set
[2022-12-27 18:13:53] <@%+hmmyespanda> @phuckingmagikal yeah busto. the esper thing was a maymay :) it's my pet deck, and bad
[2022-12-27 18:13:54] <Slim_Wenzy> It is a free 0 mana noncreature artifact that gives information and replaces itself. What‚Äôs not to love

[2022-12-27 18:14:36] <jonasso1410> could there be a wrenn safekeeper breach deck thats more arround artifacts?

[2022-12-27 18:14:46] <%HugHeist> root maze can't be legal in modern
[2022-12-27 18:14:47] <%+snakeskins777> you could just push bauble out of the format by printing "mishra's bubble" 0 mana  draw 2 cards
[2022-12-27 18:14:48] <deftjad> I've played a lot of temur breach and if you do want to play temur you still need to play shredder, W6 by itself in the 2 slot is too clunky for the mana.
[2022-12-27 18:14:53] <napoleon_borntoparty> I think breach is a fun card, just not super balanced
[2022-12-27 18:15:03] <%+nsane_goon> twice this week
[2022-12-27 18:15:15] <Dursty_> The counter argument is that wren messes with the t2 saga shredder. I don‚Äôt know why everybody isn‚Äôt on grapeshot though, so much faster clock wise
[2022-12-27 18:15:21] <$delver_of_farts> Grixis is my favorite color combo thank you aspiring spike you are hero to all farts

[2022-12-27 18:17:13] <%+snakeskins777> but it had uro and kroxa.  sigh...poor uro.
[2022-12-27 18:17:13] <%+SolemnMTG> Its mainly that Escape doesnt Exile the card the next time it would leave play or be cast
[2022-12-27 18:17:14] <Venomancer77> No people just slept on everything that wasn‚Äôt Oko + Uro
[2022-12-27 18:17:27] <%CrookedSidewalks> That dingo list sounds like a lot of fun

[2022-12-27 18:17:50] <deftjad> @Fleecemane34 not really, most mechanics can be balanced appropriately. Breach is the only egregious design.
[2022-12-27 18:17:56] <$delver_of_farts> I always liked having dress down main in shadow, but probably not as good as breach without lurrus

[2022-12-27 19:04:35] <@%Badagaboosh> Do we maybe want 1 Alpine Moon for Dwarven Mine? Or is that too cute?

[2022-12-27 19:08:39] <%+forward_aerial> We need legacy horizons to get spike back into it
[2022-12-27 19:08:45] <+Carneage> ah yeah initiative is everywhere
[2022-12-27 19:08:55] <%+kentuckyfri3d> but wat if its part of FIRE design
[2022-12-27 19:08:56] <%+dravencorvinus> WotC doesn't care about Legacy, the sooner people realize that the better off we'll all be
[2022-12-27 19:08:57] <+luponegativo> are you talking about... initiative?
[2022-12-27 19:09:04] <%dadconfidand> Something something true name nemesis
[2022-12-27 19:09:04] <+w0llsm0th> I think that legacy ... as supported has plenty of open space to explore. That said the payoff for breaking it doesnt exist
[2022-12-27 19:09:22] <%+IzexD> @aspiringspike my peak legacy was 2016, I played Grixis Delver with DRS and Probe and it was glorious, the good old days ig

[2022-12-27 19:09:36] <+abagofrocks_> commander cards just probably shouldn't be legal in legacy / pauper
[2022-12-27 19:09:42] <GravidadeBugado> modern still have ragavan, wizards dont care aboult it as well
[2022-12-27 19:10:18] <+YoungxSachi> initiative even making waves in vintage it needs to go.
[2022-12-27 19:10:20] <+doodleman_212> Ragavan without dash is a well designed card

[2022-12-27 19:10:25] <+Optimus_Tom> If Ragavan entered the Dungeon they'd care, smh wotc
[2022-12-27 19:10:28] <+luponegativo> modern has ragavan, solitude, wrenn, fury, expressive iteration... that's why it is the best format
[2022-12-27 19:10:35] <caquaa> just because a card is powerful, doesn't mean it needs banned
[2022-12-27 19:10:41] <doofmonster> @luponegativo based
[2022-12-27 19:10:59] <+DrTerrier> its format warping
[2022-12-27 19:11:07] <+Optimus_Tom> makes sense, people overreact over teh monke
[2022-12-27 19:11:09] <+abagofrocks_> play bad cards, ragavan has no power /kappa
[2022-12-27 19:11:11] <%HugHeist> but spike, deathtouch for players
[2022-12-27 19:11:15] <armater> spike i was sleeping with you on speaker and just wanted you to know you made me dream of ancestral recall but it cost phyrexian white mana and you can only cast it if you're below 13 life
[2022-12-27 19:11:18] <%d0gula> It‚Äôs a red creature.
[2022-12-27 19:11:18] <+BoxingWthShadows> psychic damage is off the charts, but physical damage is 2
[2022-12-27 19:11:19] <+Hottest_Lamia> It's not wrenn getting a land back ? Sad
[2022-12-27 19:11:22] <+Noble_Rooster> @drterrier Because we need to the most basic removal in our decks
[2022-12-27 19:11:24] <%bsanderson22> whats been your toughest matchup with this deck
[2022-12-27 19:11:28] <+ronin93> ragavan is ok if you can't protect it for 0 mana like you could in legacy
[2022-12-27 19:11:37] <%+Dylanthesquig> I miss my old decks, but modern is good right now
[2022-12-27 19:11:37] <+ecstasy_in_service> sometimes it does very little, but the highs it can have are crazy for a 1 drop
[2022-12-27 19:11:41] <+wilnet2> it would feel better if it took a card from the bottom of your library with minimal change to power level
[2022-12-27 19:11:42] <%+lolbrolol> !eprice roiling vortex
[2022-12-27 19:11:42] <%$DrMuggy> I think Raga is format warping, but OK within that warped format it creates
[2022-12-27 19:11:43] <@%^MTGBot> Roiling Vortex prices via MTGOTraders: MTGO: PRM: 22.26tix, ZNR: 8.69tix
[2022-12-27 19:11:47] <+luponegativo> modern is good because there are a lot of strong cards for every archetype, for every play-style
[2022-12-27 19:11:51] <larrylegend420> It's pretty bad when they exile your only wincon...
[2022-12-27 19:11:57] <%dadconfidand> I think the most feels bad moment of getting hit by a ragavan is probably bolt or thoughtseize
[2022-12-27 19:11:58] <+ottreb> its unfun to get hit because he robbs you
[2022-12-27 19:12:00] <%+snakeskins777> I love ragavan warping modern to force t1 interaction
