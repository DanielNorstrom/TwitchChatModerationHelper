[2022-12-07 17:32:06] <%+JoyInAbility> two lofts with desks under?
[2022-12-07 17:32:09] <Archscurl> Oh yeah! A guitar?
[2022-12-07 17:32:12] <ImJakeDeason> Oh I would choose the pink room before the green one
[2022-12-07 17:32:13] <capturingsol2> they could be artists- one with a guitar and one with an easel
[2022-12-07 17:32:15] <%stephafulify> yes
[2022-12-07 17:32:16] <+miaxgraham> double beds? you MIGHT be able to fit in haha
[2022-12-07 17:32:16] <gracehill_> Green guitar?
[2022-12-07 17:32:18] <TheQueerArtPagan> I can't remember, doesn't the Snoball pendant light have a green swatch?
[2022-12-07 17:32:18] <%mallowsauce> This is such a fun build
[2022-12-07 17:32:19] <Jeanieus> are gaming consoles base game?
[2022-12-07 17:32:20] <%+Pizza_Party_Princess> Loveit
[2022-12-07 17:32:25] <TheQueerArtPagan> That paper sphere light?
[2022-12-07 17:32:25] <%sandiecheeks231> Do it
[2022-12-07 17:32:28] <snowysimsie> hows the chaotic fire toilet doing?
[2022-12-07 17:32:35] <+SG816> I would personally hit my shin on the corner of that bed daily
[2022-12-07 17:32:35] <@%^Moobot> SAVE AND SIP! simsieTea
[2022-12-07 17:32:37] <%+batuubabe> baby yoda in this room? he's green!
[2022-12-07 17:32:41] <%msmadamemim> terrible. I love them!
[2022-12-07 17:32:44] <jobailey8> gotta go run some errands, bye!!
[2022-12-07 17:32:49] <@%+MrsTomato101814> you could do a desk under one and a dresser under another loft?
[2022-12-07 17:32:54] <ImJakeDeason> love it
[2022-12-07 17:32:55] <gracehill_> I like that
[2022-12-07 17:33:03] <+elfsoupy> one of them could have the loft bed with a desk under
[2022-12-07 17:33:13] <xxtheragebabexx> I think bunk beds in a different room could be better
[2022-12-07 17:33:17] <ImJakeDeason> but night stands don't work at all
[2022-12-07 17:33:23] <@%+MrsTomato101814> ohhhh yeah
[2022-12-07 17:33:26] <bnpeach> simsieBop
[2022-12-07 17:33:28] <+elfsoupy> just one loft!
[2022-12-07 17:33:38] <%veggioh> Maybe move the bed away from the door?
[2022-12-07 17:33:38] <bleudelphinium4> are you going to add this house to your gallery?
[2022-12-07 17:33:41] <%+stephspotato> it makes kinda like a devide then you could make a little reading nook or something
[2022-12-07 17:33:48] <@%+MrsTomato101814> @bleudelphinium4 once its done, yes!
[2022-12-07 17:33:49] <ImJakeDeason> love that desk
[2022-12-07 17:33:56] <@%+MrsTomato101814> this feels like a teen room that way

[2022-12-07 17:34:07] <bnpeach> simsie10
[2022-12-07 17:34:09] <%mallowsauce> This could be a fun 100 baby challenge house
[2022-12-07 17:34:10] <%+alexbigamer> you could put a wardrobe against the back of the bed sticking out
[2022-12-07 17:34:12] <gracehill_> Maybe you could dress the sims to match their bedroom themes
[2022-12-07 17:34:14] <fungalkitty> two loft beds is so funkyy.... Two Of Them

[2022-12-07 17:34:18] <kamiskin> This looks a lot like my teen sisters room
[2022-12-07 17:34:20] <ImJakeDeason> @MrsTomato101814 it feels like something from a nickelodeon show
[2022-12-07 17:34:22] <jej_123> Computer
[2022-12-07 17:34:27] <bleudelphinium4> oh nice! my first time watching hahaha
[2022-12-07 17:34:30] <%sandiecheeks231> My sim is reading her book while painting. Talk about multitasking
[2022-12-07 17:34:38] <%+daizyisdizzy> the two loft beds gives me dorm room vibes (not in a bad way, in a fun friendship roomies way)
[2022-12-07 17:34:39] <crazydragon1329> looking good
[2022-12-07 17:34:39] <+ladyamyward> been gone for half an hour. I probably missed a ton
[2022-12-07 17:34:44] <larabroto> hey have u saved?
[2022-12-07 17:34:47] <capturingsol2> an easel could go by the window
[2022-12-07 17:34:49] <Jeanieus> @sandiecheeks231 maybe she is using it as a reference
[2022-12-07 17:34:53] <itsjustlouise> hii
[2022-12-07 17:34:55] <rachelanselmo> I love horrible greens
[2022-12-07 17:34:56] <%$River_Styx19> maybe in that corner you could put like an easel or a chair?
[2022-12-07 17:35:00] <gracehill_> Oooh I quite like that dresser

[2022-12-07 17:43:53] <%neebagz> the white wall with the brown and orange dots goes well with a lot of island living furniture!
[2022-12-07 17:43:55] <iisa_ac> you should put more yellow in it

Suggestions are always appreciated, but do not attempt to make demands or force Kayla to do anything. There is a difference between friendly suggestions and aggressive demands. Ultimately she is the one playing the game, not you! simsieNo
[2022-12-07 17:45:34] <+x_sapphirestars> it's fun to try new combos. there's only so much available in the base game
[2022-12-07 17:45:37] <%+avelana1989> this reminds me of Cheaper By The Dozen lol (I mean that in a good way I love that movie)

[2022-12-07 17:45:45] <%erin_mars> It's a fun wallpaper that they put up when the teens were younger, and it's growing up with them in a interesting way.
[2022-12-07 17:45:46] [Announcement] <Moobot> We're building a house for a very large family in The Sims using just the base game! simsiePanic

[2022-12-07 17:45:47] <%matanm03> You can’t never perfectly match not in the sims and not in real lide
[2022-12-07 17:45:47] <%$doodlerskadoodler> I am actually going to use that wallpaper and furniture combo in my next build!!
[2022-12-07 17:45:48] <Jeanieus> I wish the room was larger because colourwise I feel like the modern dollhouse just match

[2022-12-07 17:46:10] <bnpeach> I like building with base game because I find stuff I never k re existed
[2022-12-07 17:46:10] <%saimonsimsly> yeah you have to make the base game exciting

[2022-12-07 17:49:17] <%erin_mars> The "Robin's Egg Blue" that we had painted our kitchen at our old place turned out to be a really bad "Institutional Green" when we used it in our bathroom here. The lighting changes colors in weird ways.

[2022-12-07 17:51:19] <%+dcknx> my mom once painted my room in light pink and purple to match a sofa bed she was given by a family member and didn't know what to do with, so she put it in my room - all without my knowledge and omg I hated it (my parents also refused to repaint it for ages)
[2022-12-07 17:51:26] <Kampfzwergla> I never used this wallpaper, but I kinda love it in that room! I think I´m gonna use it more often

[2022-12-07 17:54:26] <+elfsoupy> u look really pretty in purple kayla!
[2022-12-07 17:54:28] <Jeanieus> ladybugs are the best bugs, you can't change my mind
[2022-12-07 17:54:31] <%stephafulify> when i hear early year, i just assume sometime in the first quarter
[2022-12-07 17:54:32] <hanieluv> helloo!
[2022-12-07 17:54:34] <TheQueerArtPagan> I love when toddlers go to get rid of a plate and through the magic of the game they just WHIP that plate up to the top of a bookshelf or something. LOL
[2022-12-07 17:54:36] <%+wrensamphire> first half but aiming for first quarter would be my guess
[2022-12-07 17:54:38] <@%+MrsTomato101814> im hoping it'll be jan because im impatient
[2022-12-07 17:54:40] <+mymagicmonster> I think it's march

I didn't like the color purple at all and very sad when my room looked purple in the basement due to the shadows! years later I changed rooms, and loved my blue room! now it's a mint teal.

[2022-12-07 18:00:11] <juliebeans2> although i think sleeping across from a mirror is bad luck
[2022-12-07 18:00:16] <%erin_mars> The only time that the woods all match is if you go and buy the "showroom" set.
[2022-12-07 18:00:16] <@%^Moobot> simsieNo NO, DO THIS! CHANGE THIS! EWWWW! Backseat gaming is NEVER allowed. Suggestions are always appreciated, but do not attempt to make demands or force Kayla to do anything. There is a difference between friendly suggestions and aggressive demands.

[2022-12-07 18:01:56] <@%+MrsTomato101814> maybe paint the walls to see how it all ties together?
[2022-12-07 18:01:57] <SpookieToast> It looks lovely and cozy
[2022-12-07 18:01:58] <theflyingfiona> It needs a little pizazz

[2022-12-07 18:02:08] <%Jeais> @mrstomato101814 My husband could honestly just use a timer for showers simsieLOL
[2022-12-07 18:02:09] <itssjamiee> the different wood tones throw it off
[2022-12-07 18:02:09] <gracehill_> and the clock in my dining room doesnt work either and i was on a zoom call and my teacher pointed out it didnt work
[2022-12-07 18:02:10] <%$mynameisshyra> does your grandma have THE bird clock?
[2022-12-07 18:02:10] <agwifey> I do like the white swatch of the fireplace. Maybe try that again since the rest of the room is done?
[2022-12-07 18:02:15] <capturingsol2> instead of a fireplace you could use one of those skinny tables maybe
[2022-12-07 18:02:18] <apwrldddd> the small book self by the chair
[2022-12-07 18:02:19] <%+theanykey_> can we see your nails?

[2022-12-07 18:14:19] <fr0ggyb4bby> no
[2022-12-07 18:14:20] <%+ljewel1120> I agree with Simsie
[2022-12-07 18:14:23] <alasterno> i would delete the whole thing and cry lol
[2022-12-07 18:14:24] <DeathAtTheRave> No I love the way you have it
[2022-12-07 18:14:25] <Lexf0ri> I would put a column
[2022-12-07 18:14:25] <%+Pizza_Party_Princess> Looks great as is
[2022-12-07 18:14:26] <unemployedgarfield> Id put all the way
[2022-12-07 18:14:28] <luuuubeltri> yes
[2022-12-07 18:14:28] <asvpalivia> looks better the way you do it
[2022-12-07 18:14:28] <$passionfairy55> if only you could paint half tiles
[2022-12-07 18:14:28] <gracehill_> maybe you could put a wall there to hide it
[2022-12-07 18:14:28] <crazydragon1329> leave it
[2022-12-07 18:14:28] <%+wrensamphire> I always have to use the wallpaper that matches the top of the tile swatch so I don't have that blend problem
[2022-12-07 18:14:28] <%erin_mars> I would only do it to the edge of the doorfram IF the doorfram ended on the tile.
[2022-12-07 18:14:30] <+BosseladyTV> I agree with @lilsimsie !
[2022-12-07 18:14:30] <DeathAtTheRave> It’s perfect as is
[2022-12-07 18:14:31] <%+samibuni> i like it flush with the counter
[2022-12-07 18:14:31] <%$sarcasticsoprano_7> oh yeah I would definitely put it all the way
[2022-12-07 18:14:32] <$lisa71670> They all bother me so I don't do it  LOL
[2022-12-07 18:14:33] <%lilbuuny> I’d put it all the way since it’s all of the kitchen
[2022-12-07 18:14:33] <+zuzizana> the kids eat in the corner so maybe the whole wall
[2022-12-07 18:14:33] <AmethystWyvernZephyr> i like it that way too
[2022-12-07 18:14:33] <%amaisbooks> I wonder if they didn't realise that the door was on a half tile
[2022-12-07 18:14:36] <fungalkitty> honestly trying to do this kinda stuff gives me headaches every time it's always so jarring... augh
[2022-12-07 18:14:39] <%Missygirl93> kitchens are annoying
[2022-12-07 18:14:39] <neubneub> Are you going to decorate this home for the holidays?
[2022-12-07 18:14:39] <loveforbees> keep what you want the sims is restricting
[2022-12-07 18:14:39] <%+norrisliva> I think one more is better than this, but everybody is allowed own opinion
[2022-12-07 18:14:40] <+Embeth11> Then I'm glad you're happy with it!
[2022-12-07 18:14:43] <TheQueerArtPagan> Nah, ending above the door would drive me bonkers. ^^;
[2022-12-07 18:14:43] <det_shartpants> What if you did it one more than got a higher door
[2022-12-07 18:14:45] <agwifey> Let’s see how much it is now! 😂
[2022-12-07 18:14:46] <%halfmoonmysti> I would put one more and have the arch line up with it but the way you have it is fine
[2022-12-07 18:14:47] <%erin_mars> But not when the doorframe is across 2 tiles
[2022-12-07 18:14:48] <%matanm03> Maybe with an arch way with coulms
[2022-12-07 18:14:49] <%$Maiizee> this house looks so cozy!
[2022-12-07 18:14:50] <snowysimsie> hows the chaotic fire toilet doing?
[2022-12-07 18:14:52] <%miltsuh> What about adding a column there?
[2022-12-07 18:14:53] <%+Pizza_Party_Princess> Can we move them in?
[2022-12-07 18:14:55] <loveforbees> i had a dream I was watching your stream haha
[2022-12-07 18:14:58] <%$SailorScout04> It looks great!!
[2022-12-07 18:15:00] <%+herewegoajenn> I don't mind it abruptly stopping if it makes sense/blends with the other wall color but I feel like IRL if you went from tile to paneling you'd have some type of column/border/trim
[2022-12-07 18:15:00] <%+sam8716> I wish they had an actual backsplash object
[2022-12-07 18:15:07] <%+stephspotato> I feel like thats a perfect spot for a family photo
[2022-12-07 18:15:08] <%+stRoOoObLe> how long are you streaming today Kayla?
[2022-12-07 18:15:11] <%Jeais> I want half and quarter tile wall and floor placement in sims 5 simsieEyes
[2022-12-07 18:15:11] <TheQueerArtPagan> I've done that in a pinch and had to hide it with above-door decorations. ^^;
[2022-12-07 18:15:11] <Lexf0ri> cowplant! cowplant!
[2022-12-07 18:15:12] <mariestar16> Its funny how we have so many different tastes!!You do what you like
[2022-12-07 18:15:12] <%stephafulify> i dont think theres a perfect way to make that aesthetically pleasing
[2022-12-07 18:15:12] <APalKennDream> plates so they fall on the babies heads LUL
