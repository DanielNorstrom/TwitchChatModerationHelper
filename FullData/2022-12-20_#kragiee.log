[2022-12-20 14:00:31] <+Binladeslol> seems legit and i experienced that after winning 2 games i was already matching some master 3/5 but then i dropped back down ( newish to overwatch )
[2022-12-20 14:00:43] <Azmainwara> imagine a person who just gets really lucky with good teammates and faces top 500 while actually plat
[2022-12-20 14:01:00] <deactivated> ICANT now imagine there wouldnt be engagement optimized matchmaking
[2022-12-20 14:01:06] <+Flawlessbuthead11> This new system sucks, I’ll win 7 in a row but since I lost 5 in between I did all that work to not even change tanks

[2022-12-20 14:03:02] <%hskaz> yesterday i had a game on gold/plat level where enemy team had diamond challenger (actualy plat after season reset) and he destroyed our tank
[2022-12-20 14:03:10] <yeaipaid> bro how to get that aim cursor setting?
[2022-12-20 14:03:11] <%bebex001_> It feels to me that I don't get matched into a higher rank lobby but against a higher rank lobby. my stats don't change but it feels so much harder after a winstreak
[2022-12-20 14:03:22] <+Flawlessbuthead11> I’ve noticed that after I placed, even if I won’t change ranks my games will get noticeably harder after 7 wins
[2022-12-20 14:03:34] <Geoneiric> Yep after a winstreak you get bad games

[2022-12-20 14:06:42] <Geoneiric> They throw you a terrible tank and then when you avoid they’re not on the other team, just a different lobby
[2022-12-20 14:06:45] <Azmainwara> wait so its bad to get a winning streak then
[2022-12-20 14:06:50] <Geoneiric> They are only there to make you lose

[2022-12-20 14:12:41] <%hskaz> looking from the support side, I preferred the old system because keeping over 50% win rate I knew that I was slowly going up. now, not having such strength as for example a tank, still maintaining over 50% of wins, I stand in the same rank because I finish my scores 7-4/5 almost always and I don't drop or advance.

[2022-12-20 15:12:30] <%+teh_neilz> The visuals were OPAF especially in 3d.
[2022-12-20 15:12:42] <@%emmy_ish> i'm sure u can just rent it, have a cozy evening inside watching it Comfi
[2022-12-20 15:12:42] <%sweatytxint> @reyy32 Yeah seeing it in 3D made it so much better

[2022-12-20 15:13:13] <novelgiani> I don't like watching 3D movies anymore
[2022-12-20 15:13:16] <+tm_901> it was the same with avatar 1 ig, it was the visuals that made it
[2022-12-20 15:13:17] <%+teh_neilz> @rubstergutt um yes. plot : blue people live happily ever after, white men want to take all their resources, exactly the same plots.
[2022-12-20 15:13:23] <@%emmy_ish> @Bucatin0 whaaat that film is really good!
[2022-12-20 15:13:28] <ocefrag> 3D with IMAX is amazing
[2022-12-20 15:13:32] <novelgiani> It's hard to put on the 3D glasses when I also need my regular glasses to actually see

[2022-12-20 17:10:12] <+Yohoho151rum> is league of legends arcane worth watching for someone who doesn't play LoL or know much about it?  i really like that playgrounds song and didnt know anything about arcane.
[2022-12-20 17:10:31] <serafinrkt> @Yohoho151rum Yeah, watch it
[2022-12-20 17:10:50] <crabf> @Yohoho151rum ive heard multiple people say its friendly to non-lol players and the show is good
[2022-12-20 17:10:57] <Eliciana_> Never played LOL in my life and still enjoyed and understood the storyline a lot
[2022-12-20 17:10:59] <fachan504> @Yohoho151rum yeah man no need to know how to play lol just enjoy it

[2022-12-20 17:11:20] <+owFero> arcane isnt even the same story as league

[2022-12-20 17:13:02] <%OtelDeraj> yeah I am pretty sure that Arcane, considering it is literally run by Riot games, is cannon.
[2022-12-20 17:13:07] <+owFero> @MOURAKUE the creators of the show have stated in interviews and ama's that Arcanes universe is not the same as the LOL game universe
[2022-12-20 17:13:11] <%OtelDeraj> also probably one of the best shows of the last few years easily

[2022-12-20 17:13:53] <Saturdaywww> i think ow pve will be boring af
[2022-12-20 17:13:55] <+owFero> Yes? they have completley different stories in the league lore compared to arcane?
[2022-12-20 17:14:01] <+lstratz> @Chigu in a few hours I think he does
[2022-12-20 17:14:14] <Arcalypse_OW> I'm mainly stoked for PvE to get more of the lore because I'm lame and love the OW lore lol.
[2022-12-20 17:14:18] <Absolism> Off topic but does anyone know where the character config files are located for ow2? My Ashe and cree settings are bugged on my alt and I can’t figure it out
[2022-12-20 17:14:35] <the0spark> i think blizzard will rework the characters just for the pve
[2022-12-20 17:14:36] <+owFero> ok im not gonna argue about something this stupid
[2022-12-20 17:14:37] <Arcalypse_OW> @Absolism - Just reset all settings to default.

[2022-12-20 17:14:46] <Arcalypse_OW> Because place to start is just starting all default and going from there.

[2022-12-20 23:52:21] <%jovach23> @Mikeverv my guess is its some sort of health and safety to force players to have a break before playing so many matches?
[2022-12-20 23:52:43] <%jovach23> since playing 3 bo3 and then 2 bo5 is a lot of games
[2022-12-20 23:52:58] <!%Mikeverv> @jovach23 But team Jake didnt have a break
