[2022-12-07 17:37:07] <%+IOX03> what cops are harder to lose NA or EU?
[2022-12-07 17:37:08] <+xxeternalxzephyrxx> Angel is a better driver but not a better chaser
[2022-12-07 17:37:10] <%+ForcefulM> Aj ez
[2022-12-07 17:37:10] <Kayy24s_> but she's very aggro
[2022-12-07 17:37:12] <%abinator2345> yea
[2022-12-07 17:37:13] <krollo6> Bass is up there as well
[2022-12-07 17:37:14] <%uglygod_complex> yes
[2022-12-07 17:37:16] <%+Unique_Empire> Alex from angles cop
[2022-12-07 17:37:16] <%+Circelo> Suarez just sticks
[2022-12-07 17:37:23] <krishxnaik> I would say suarez and aziz have been the most consistent
[2022-12-07 17:37:27] <+EuanW04> Suarez is consistent
[2022-12-07 17:37:34] <+o8j8m> suarez probs the best in terms of being a fair cop when chasing
[2022-12-07 17:37:36] <%+unofficialpurp> Suarez is the best chaser
[2022-12-07 17:37:47] <finmaxfield> Croc sticks as well
[2022-12-07 17:37:49] <%+unofficialpurp> not the best racer
[2022-12-07 17:37:57] <+kfghd> cops that keep chase going are the best
[2022-12-07 17:37:58] <+CxGray> he would rather chase the racer than the W
[2022-12-07 17:37:58] <sir_ib_dukeofdungun> test
[2022-12-07 17:38:00] <d_mavn> 100% agree
[2022-12-07 17:38:03] <HuntingJack> Suarez is the best for a chase yeah
[2022-12-07 17:38:04] <%RoZee_P> Yeah Wuarez
[2022-12-07 17:38:04] <emilyisme8> Yea
[2022-12-07 17:38:04] <luks10s> he is fair and extends situations
[2022-12-07 17:38:08] <%uglygod_complex> W chaser
[2022-12-07 17:38:13] <%lufc_jamie> aziz too
[2022-12-07 17:38:15] <krishxnaik> I think he knows when to stick on ur ass or give space in a chase really well
[2022-12-07 17:38:18] <+xxeternalxzephyrxx> suarez is a chaser whiles there alot of drivers who are better but can't chase
[2022-12-07 17:38:22] <%+AGL0ve> Yeah Tommy got boxed 2mins in a S+ once
[2022-12-07 17:38:24] <krishxnaik> thats why he lasts so long
[2022-12-07 17:38:35] <urouge_0> They rp as a serious cop as a serious cop u would give a chance to the crim
[2022-12-07 17:38:39] <d_mavn> Suarez is intelligent in chases
