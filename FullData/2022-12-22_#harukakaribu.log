[2022-12-22 01:12:22] <%Xzaven> that are not actual 50%, but 50% to MSRP, you have no idea how much it is regularly
[2022-12-22 01:12:29] <mx990> You need a vacuum pump as well, though
[2022-12-22 01:12:29] <+Tsuyoshi1345> but maybe a little bit expensive to start with
[2022-12-22 01:12:33] <%$Northstar690> is it REALLY 50% off though or did they just add 50% off to take off
[2022-12-22 01:12:35] <%onigirilastfan> does your stove work with it

[2022-12-22 13:04:12] <%invaluableperson> Never really seen why fans of the original would want a live-action adaptation of animated things. Like, animation can usually do so much more that live-action is a step down. Makes sense for companies to want it - wider audience makes more money - but on the fan perspective I don't get it haruchiThonk

[2022-12-22 13:21:27] <KimiVerdure> The first few episodes were bad, it may have got better after though. It was more they didn't know who the audience was for, and they censored a lot at first. Early 00s anime censoring was wild

[2022-12-22 13:21:59] <%+iicrazypanda> imo sub in general is better cause most of the time the energy is conveyed well but sometimes dubs can be really good too. for example I like the dub for the dragonball series more than the sub.

[2022-12-22 15:02:21] <aeroareo> CG is a slippery slope
[2022-12-22 15:02:35] <KimiVerdure> Final Destination is that same era of horror movies as the Saw movies, where they did well and just got pumped out into insanity
[2022-12-22 15:02:58] <%invaluableperson> CG is like autotune - good if used with precision, but generally NOT used with precision so it becomes annoying.

[2022-12-22 16:34:38] <%bushido613> Those scalpers that buy card packs just buy them and then sell them to card shops
[2022-12-22 16:34:41] <BarthusReed> honestly really wish they'd start selling through the mail at a 1 per person rate

[2022-12-22 16:37:55] <%aeroareo> green ranger was the most popular imo

[2022-12-22 16:38:09] <%bushido613> Even then. Reprints shouldn‚Äôt be selling at outrageous rates. They‚Äôre basically reproductions with a McDonald‚Äôs logo slapped on it
[2022-12-22 16:38:09] <RWBYfan95> @aeroareo o7 to Jason David Frank
[2022-12-22 16:38:13] <KimiVerdure> Mighty Morphin Power Rangers was great as a kid, Power Rangers In Space and Power Rangers Lost Galaxy too

[2022-12-22 16:39:35] <KimiVerdure> The Power Rangers movie a few years ago was actually pretty fun, there was some fun nods to the original in there.

[2022-12-22 16:50:25] <%invaluableperson> @invaluableperson Depends. Each programmer writes in a different way. Most code is built on top of previous code, but only amateurs do ONLY Frankenstein code and nothing original. That whole "original writing for each programmer" is why legacy code is such a huge problem for long-lived things - it takes multiple team to understand legacy code.
[2022-12-22 16:50:30] <%SinR2014> agreed BarthusReed

[2022-12-22 17:15:36] <Phovesmos> If the subathon is "Uncapped" and "Uncapped" means that each time someone subscribes, the timer goes up, then how come this timer has yet to go up?
[2022-12-22 17:15:47] <Phovesmos> Or does it just never go up?

[2022-12-22 17:16:00] <%invaluableperson> Funny story about that actually. A previous subathon I followed actually paused it for the "final night" to be nice so there'd be one full day left, but a bunch of people dropped thousands of subs as soon as she went to sleep and pushed it to three more days. Was a nice morning troll for her :V

[2022-12-22 17:34:31] <%+iicrazypanda> I once had a customer who ordered a pizza for pickup so I needed a name for pickup. He said Caprice and I typed in Caprice but as the phones aren't the best I told him: Caprice? Okay? but he misheard it as me saying Capiche and making fun of the name so he asked for manager KEKW

[2022-12-22 18:38:02] <%supersonic407> I haven't seen FMAB yet, but I do remember hearing that it stays more true to the manga than the other anime adaptations.
[2022-12-22 18:38:04] <encon_1988> soul eater is a good one
[2022-12-22 18:38:07] <%nic1984kekwfathead> never finished soul eater, someone spoiled the ending for me lol
[2022-12-22 18:38:08] <Manamari> I like Jojo, but it's not one of those anime I can binge-watch... small doses only
[2022-12-22 18:38:10] <@%Arielle> the person that dropped my food off had their dog I'm so happy
[2022-12-22 18:38:14] <%ThreePennyS> soul eater was good didnt really like the season they brought out a couple of year ago tho
[2022-12-22 18:38:27] <rainaMabow> @Manamari because it puts you to sleep too? or the colors and warped perspectives hurt your head? lol

[2022-12-22 18:38:54] <+Daoverlord> soul eater is great but final ep didnt release to world... only release in japen
[2022-12-22 18:39:02] <rainaMabow> @nic1984kekwfathead courage?
[2022-12-22 18:39:03] <%invaluableperson> If Merryweather's company keeps putting in the work, those Vshojo videos could technically be compiled into an OVA ;)
[2022-12-22 18:39:09] <captdishwasher> IIRC ist‚Äôs
[2022-12-22 18:39:09] <KimiVerdure> The manga is still ongoing. I can dream
[2022-12-22 18:39:15] <encon_1988> war on geminar was kinda fucked up
[2022-12-22 18:39:18] <%iVyze> Fairy Tail is my favorite anime but I'm sad about the ending

[2022-12-22 18:39:43] <captdishwasher> IIRC Kizuna Ai is getting one
[2022-12-22 18:39:46] <Manamari> @rainaMabow tbh I'm not sure what it is that makes it hard for me to binge-watch. it's really only an issue with the Netflix season anyway since before that I watched it weekly on Toonami
[2022-12-22 18:39:47] <%ThreePennyS> didnt hololive technically do one with short 3 min episodes?
[2022-12-22 18:40:00] <%+iicrazypanda> No game no life fans waiting almost 9 years for a 2nd season that probably won't come out KEKW

[2022-12-22 18:58:07] <%Mazzax_Manacry> Ash is only 10 because of time manipulation off-screen. The passage of time has been acknowledged in-universe.

[2022-12-22 19:11:56] <%iVyze> have you played Metal Gear Solid
[2022-12-22 19:12:08] <lunramoth> but I guess that's different
[2022-12-22 19:12:10] <%invaluableperson> I don't have a Switch so, even if I had interest in pokemon, I couldn't play it haruchiShrug

[2022-12-22 19:12:19] <lunramoth> I played every single one
[2022-12-22 19:12:19] <%kyulen742> the only pokemon game i played was platinum, i just like to watch others play pokemon games
[2022-12-22 19:12:24] <lunramoth> I loved them

[2022-12-22 19:12:40] <%invaluableperson> You guys play the Mystery Dungeon games? Those were awesome!
[2022-12-22 19:12:42] <lunramoth> original demon souls was as good as the remake
[2022-12-22 19:12:44] <%+whitegrimknight> I'm finally back.
[2022-12-22 19:12:50] <KimiVerdure> Revengence is just stupid fun, I love that game

[2022-12-22 19:13:28] <%invaluableperson> Pokemon Conquest was also another fun spin-off, though it was the victim of poor marketing.
