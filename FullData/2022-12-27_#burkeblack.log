[2022-12-27 12:34:59] <%Spidersfury> I'm so sick of James Cameron's ego when it comes to movies. He's such a narcissistic douche bag. He couldn't handle how close Marvel movies came close to "his" when it comes to money.
[2022-12-27 12:35:00] <%+macclunkey> it is the production budget X2 for marketing to break even
[2022-12-27 12:35:06] <timewarper9000> witch is shocking becuse i havent seen a small movie like that before  in a while everyones been big production or even small production is grabbing money not a film just doing it for arts sake.
[2022-12-27 12:35:24] <timewarper9000> so is it cgi or is brandon not so fit anymore?
[2022-12-27 12:35:36] <KimTheMisfit> it's mostly practical effects, pretty sure
[2022-12-27 12:35:36] <%Molehj> its a fat suit

[2022-12-27 13:11:45] <%Molehj> When you get into people who can warp reality its gets really messy LUL
[2022-12-27 13:11:45] <DennistheDutchie> @timewarper9000 Who determines what is good?
[2022-12-27 13:11:46] <%+Panda_c260> the flash vs superman and you have that fight from invinvible bukre crreamKek
[2022-12-27 13:11:47] <timewarper9000> yes
[2022-12-27 13:11:51] <+True_King_In_Yellow> Superman has two weaknesses, Kyrptonite, and Lois Lane
[2022-12-27 13:11:58] <%Lain_2779> superman can fly fast enough around the planet to turn back time
[2022-12-27 13:11:58] <timewarper9000> we need an american red sun superman
[2022-12-27 13:12:03] <%Lain_2779> true storyu
[2022-12-27 13:12:05] <+ayohammie> flash power would be useless at that point
[2022-12-27 13:12:06] <%Spidersfury> The power of speed does nothing though if you have nothing to back it up? Supe has speed and....well, ya know.
[2022-12-27 13:12:21] <+BIGGAME2EZ> Superman has laser beams
[2022-12-27 13:12:24] <Jormungander1> superman has nothing on the dark side
[2022-12-27 13:12:25] <sshen13> If there’s one thing the Justice League movie done right it’s how Superman beat everyone easily
[2022-12-27 13:12:32] <+awi5951> Didnt the  flash say he was playing with superman when they was racing
[2022-12-27 13:12:36] VIEWERS: 2 449
[2022-12-27 13:12:39] <SmiteMachine> in terms of comics, what i understand flash beats superman like nothing in terms of speed
[2022-12-27 13:12:39] <austin1561> wouldnt superman weaken if he was super far away from a sun and his powers change due to a diffrent sun?
[2022-12-27 13:12:44] <Shivalla> Do you agree that Wanda Maximoff would absolutely obliterate Superman if they would go against each other? @burkeblack
[2022-12-27 13:12:49] <+BIGGAME2EZ> Superman can fry anyone with laser eyes I think
[2022-12-27 13:12:51] <%+DrkStalkr> @BurkeBlack  I think Doctor Manhattan could take out superman
[2022-12-27 13:12:59] <timewarper9000> and superman himself would determine it good he would argue its the only way to defend the innocent and would only kill if neccucary or the enemy kept persisting like a cop would.
[2022-12-27 13:12:59] <%+IceCrack1> @True_King_In_Yellow Only one weakness in that and it ain't Kyrpt
[2022-12-27 13:13:01] <CocoonMoon> I never watched a Superman movie, but I know the scene from the one where Flash is doing the "running around the enemy" thing and Superman follows him with his eyes like "I see you :) " Thought that seemed very cool
[2022-12-27 13:13:19] <+BIGGAME2EZ> Nothing can stop Superman’s laser beams
[2022-12-27 13:13:31] <timewarper9000> can you imagine a superman who uses magic?
[2022-12-27 13:13:32] <+awi5951> She is worse than that she can change the whole world to her liking
[2022-12-27 13:13:40] <+originalflyboy> @CocoonMoon Yeah, one of the best scenes in a  superhero movie ever =D
[2022-12-27 13:13:40] <+ayohammie> she is technically a god
[2022-12-27 13:13:44] <%Moose__Nipples> Wanda is able to bend reality to herwill
[2022-12-27 13:13:46] <%Lain_2779> ah, the multiverse, the movie that traveled between 3 worlds
[2022-12-27 13:13:50] <NexusHives> Isn't she the only triple S class mutant?

[2022-12-27 13:14:07] <timewarper9000> look ok I admit it I want homelanders cape its cool lol @BurkeBlack
[2022-12-27 13:14:09] <+True_King_In_Yellow> depends on the Superman, hes has done cosmic godlike things, he can see moleuler structurs, hes sneezed universes away..
[2022-12-27 13:14:12] <$BanditWeazle> Question who would win Wanda or the Phoenix
[2022-12-27 13:14:12] <sshen13> The multiverse where every Dr Strange looks alike, meanwhile for Spider-Man…

[2022-12-27 13:14:44] <KimTheMisfit> in the MCU movies she's not a mutant because they don't have the rights to the mutant bit, I believe lol
[2022-12-27 13:14:56] <%Moose__Nipples> i thought her powers were magic
[2022-12-27 13:15:00] <KimTheMisfit> they had her be a result of experiments with the stone
[2022-12-27 13:15:02] <%jake_wu6410> True.
[2022-12-27 13:15:07] <+BIGGAME2EZ> I need to watch more super hero movies I have no idea who Wanda is
[2022-12-27 13:15:08] <%+macclunkey> she is like dark phoenix, moral of the story is dont go to xavier for therapy

[2022-12-27 13:15:28] <timewarper9000> I think we do need a new oriogen story and a new clark kent to start us off a new DC maybe this will give DC what it needs maybe gun will eventually slavage this idk.

[2022-12-27 13:17:24] <%+Enigmal> In MARVEl there was an event called M day, where 99% of all mutants ceased to have powers all because Wanda uttered the words "No more mutants".  Her powers are beyond omega level
[2022-12-27 13:17:24] <+lockthelootgoblin> Her and jean gray are alot alike

[2022-12-27 13:22:15] <timewarper9000> there going to make there own version of 40k vurk so embrace yourself there changing everything to fit there film. it unfortinatly needed to go were they need to go with it the lore is simply material they will use to go off of.
[2022-12-27 13:22:17] <%Spidersfury> Supe essentially a solar battery, so he could live for a long time. He's still alive in the DC Universe in 84,571 AD according to DC One Million. According to Action Comics #1000, he's alive when the Sun expands and crushes the Earth, which is 3 - 5 billion years from now.
[2022-12-27 13:22:18] <spillthebeanz> if a billion can go to rings of power, then 40k should get the funding
[2022-12-27 13:22:20] <+True_King_In_Yellow> it will be Inquisitorial stuff
[2022-12-27 13:22:20] <+Yeti_Fist> the scale of the lore is insane but theres so many good smaller stories to tell within it

[2022-12-27 13:23:22] <%kimba274> i mean, Avatar 2 shows how much you can do with actors turning into *things*.
[2022-12-27 13:23:23] <timewarper9000> there going to make there own version of 40k im prepped for it and hope fans are too just enjoy the story dont look for lore friendly please its not somthing you can do in film and I also hope it has a game of thrones vibe aswell perfect fomela.
[2022-12-27 13:23:24] <%Spidersfury> Cavil is trying to change that, apparently
[2022-12-27 13:23:29] <%PKM4STER> you need something to spark the interest in the universe first for the non-40k fans

[2022-12-27 13:23:49] <Shivalla> Hmm, I wonder who they choose to write the script for the 40k movie and how Cavills executive producer work will show on it. @burkeblack  Also the director needs to be damn on point with it, it needs to be grim, bleak dystopian horror like.

[2022-12-27 13:24:51] <%+Shoggoth75> there are a lot of things in wh40k which can appeal to many people even if thy know nothing of the lore
[2022-12-27 13:24:53] <%PKM4STER> heresy would be a good start.. then flash back into 30k or so
[2022-12-27 13:25:00] <Lerekh> Start with Warhammer fantasy Kappa Holy sigmar
[2022-12-27 13:25:01] <%$pwog> Sentry vs Hyperion, who wins?
[2022-12-27 13:25:07] <%Twisted_Steel> I think you start with no space marines and build the world
[2022-12-27 13:25:10] <novakid1994> i think no matter where you start your gonna have a lot of explaining to do lol
[2022-12-27 13:25:13] <mdc5000> They could start with Emperor retaking Mars
[2022-12-27 13:25:15] <%$D0t_exe_> Eisenhorn would explain Chaos before the Heresy
[2022-12-27 13:25:15] <NewAgeFilms> Hello :)
[2022-12-27 13:25:16] <%+Panda_c260> you CAN'T start with the heresy, the heresy has to be like the red wedding, you'd have to start with at the latest the great crusade
[2022-12-27 13:25:18] <%Molehj> they need to have a classic story that everyone knows that could be set in any kind of setting, and then just put it in the 40k universe
[2022-12-27 13:25:21] <Kealsad> cultist trying to bring in demons
[2022-12-27 13:25:25] <timewarper9000> oh and end off before I leave you start with the apocalypse the emporer arriving than time skip  100 years after his death
[2022-12-27 13:25:26] <+chobtt> But for new people they would have to explain a lot if they would make and Eisenhgorn first
[2022-12-27 13:25:27] <%Spidersfury> WAIT A MINUUUUTE
[2022-12-27 13:25:28] <%PKM4STER> would be badass tho
[2022-12-27 13:25:29] <SultanSaidi> you should start with inquisitors cause they go through all the layers of society, normal citizens, army, space marines
[2022-12-27 13:25:31] <%Lain_2779> they need to pick a battle or something "simple"
