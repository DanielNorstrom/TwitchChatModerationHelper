[2022-12-11 07:50:51] <%+Shionobi> ff1 was my first RPG so it'll always be #1 for me

[2022-12-11 09:31:45] <PopisPropaganda> I think just that quick freeze that happens
[2022-12-11 09:31:53] <@%Megalith> It happens hear in the Portland A LOT because the whole city is in a valley where the we don't get snow very often. So it rains and then freezes over night... turning the whole city into a slip n slide

[2022-12-11 10:01:52] <+Fail_Snail> What I really hate in LA are comedy clubs that have "x item minimums" that don't explicitly say so when you buy tickets
[2022-12-11 10:02:03] <PopisPropaganda> haste dummy good
[2022-12-11 10:02:10] <%+MrZev> interesting they changed from accessories to relics for this game
[2022-12-11 10:02:14] <+Fail_Snail> there have been many times where i've paid like 20 or 30 bucks for a show, then gone and been forced to buy stuff after eating a meal.
[2022-12-11 10:02:15] <%stellazzio1> what @PopisPropaganda get my Son in there!!!
[2022-12-11 10:02:21] <+Genesis_Clone> i loved Haste Regen in this game was an obsession of mine LUL

[2022-12-11 10:03:50] <%+MrZev> @Fail_Snail All the comedy clubs  I have been to here in Houston have all been very up front about a 2 drink \item minimum. Id be pretty annoyed if i was about to walk out and they said i needed to order more.
[2022-12-11 10:04:16] <+Genesis_Clone> imo its one of the more unbalanced spells in the game.
[2022-12-11 10:04:19] <PopisPropaganda> that being said bad guys seem a lot tuffer
[2022-12-11 10:04:25] <+Genesis_Clone> series**

[2022-12-11 10:05:07] <+Fail_Snail> @MrZev I think the ones in LA/Hollywood are pretty upfront AT the venue, but I tend to buy tickets online for stuff in advance
[2022-12-11 10:05:19] <PopisPropaganda> like I thought something was up earlier but this sold it. bad folk doing like 50% more dmg?
[2022-12-11 10:05:57] <%stellazzio1> but wait are the Mods asslep
[2022-12-11 10:06:04] <%stellazzio1> hehe Grinch!
[2022-12-11 10:06:07] <%+MrZev> @Fail_Snail  me and my friends would end up winning free tickets and go that way, so for us, it worked out nicely.

[2022-12-11 11:04:05] <%Cyberventurer> Something like that happened to another streamer I used to watch. Someone joined her community and spent an entire week interacting and being friendly and all that, then suddenly spoiled all of Dragon Quest 11 as she was playing through it for the first time and immediately quit the chat and discord and it crushed her.

[2022-12-11 13:23:23] <%TidusZecht> subgoal when?
[2022-12-11 13:23:24] <NIghtdew14> I've done that run.  It's interesting on what you still can't grab without recruiting a character.
[2022-12-11 13:23:25] <choco_1980> next year's incentive :P
[2022-12-11 13:23:54] <%TidusZecht> what exactly did that guy say?
[2022-12-11 13:23:58] <%bobby678a> seven i completed ff6 many times with only 3 or 4 party members with cheat codes of course
[2022-12-11 13:24:00] <@%Neobullseye> It's actually a specific challenge. Get Edgar and Setzer, and then immediately go into Kefka's Tower -- or at the very least don't Search for any Friends.
[2022-12-11 13:24:25] <%+rtcrules206> thanks for entertaining ^^

[2022-12-11 13:31:22] <%Myrthus> yea well.. the game assumes you would have magic so...
[2022-12-11 13:31:22] <%Lonefellow> IIRC, they were just called potions in the original translation?
[2022-12-11 13:31:57] <%Lonefellow> Yeah, just checked. And potions were tinctures
[2022-12-11 13:32:43] <%Myrthus> @Lonefellow tonic = potion, ether = tinctures, right?
[2022-12-11 13:32:52] <@%Neobullseye> ^ Thought the same, yes.
[2022-12-11 13:32:54] <%Lonefellow> Yeah, yeah. Misstyped

[2022-12-11 13:34:19] <@%Neobullseye> Ugh, Leap Frogs and Rippler... Freaking dog thieves in the original :(
[2022-12-11 13:35:23] <@%Neobullseye> So, here's a thing: Technically, Interceptor counts as a special status effect that Shadow is always 'inflicted' with. Rippler swaps all Status effects. You see where this is going, right?
[2022-12-11 13:35:31] <%Myrthus> stop bugging him

[2022-12-11 13:54:56] <@%Neobullseye> @TidusZecht And that's when you never use Magicite Shards anymore ever again XD
[2022-12-11 13:55:12] <%+JennyBeans> I do not think so
[2022-12-11 13:55:19] <NIghtdew14> I'm not ure you can.
[2022-12-11 13:55:25] <%+JennyBeans> I believe that was fixed in the PR
[2022-12-11 13:55:27] <%Myrthus> pretty sure you cant
[2022-12-11 13:55:31] <%draconix1> i do not know
[2022-12-11 13:55:37] <%TidusZecht> vanish doom bug has been fixed
[2022-12-11 13:55:48] <@%Neobullseye> Vanish still gives spells 100% hit rate, but it just no longer bypasses the immunity check.
[2022-12-11 13:56:41] <%+JennyBeans> Back in the dayyyyy inputs were memorized :P
[2022-12-11 13:56:55] <@%Neobullseye> In the Pre-GBA versions, the "If Vanish > Spell hits, Skip to end" part of the logic was placed *before* the "If immune > Spell fails, skip to end" part.
[2022-12-11 13:56:55] <+wishmaker50> ^
[2022-12-11 13:56:57] <%+JennyBeans> True!
[2022-12-11 13:57:02] <@%Neobullseye> That's where the issue came from.
[2022-12-11 13:57:10] <%+JennyBeans> I was so surprised when I saw they had them in battle
[2022-12-11 13:57:48] <%+JennyBeans> True!

[2022-12-11 14:32:31] <quaxiazu> it's silly how much stronger she'd be if setzer was removed instead of the other two
[2022-12-11 14:32:33] <%TidusZecht> bet it'd be different if setzer had gotten sneezed on

[2022-12-11 14:50:49] <%Makimakesz> FF1 was the worst, with perma crits on attacks , constant flashing

[2022-12-11 14:55:27] <%+Mike410459> Love how scared he got that he might have equipped ifrit by accident, and then now gets the shields and is all about learning things.
[2022-12-11 14:55:59] <%Myrthus> wasnt there something that teaches the lvl 1 elemental spells too?
[2022-12-11 14:56:22] <%Myrthus> so funny
[2022-12-11 14:56:47] <%TaevanGames> there is confusion sometimes that the elemental swords teach the lvl 1 spells but they don't lol
