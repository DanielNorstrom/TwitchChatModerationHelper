Me and my brothers would fight for the only warm blanket in the house but playing meat sword jousting. We would get out our meat sword and start smacking each other until someone gives up. I always went for the turky leg in the fridge. What were you thinking of, streamer?]

Not only are they in the degen egg group, which is mostly comprised of mammals, MiyaMewrilee are an average of 5‚Äù7‚Äô tall and 130 pounds, this means they‚Äôre large enough to be able handle human dicks, and with their impressive Base Stats for HP and access to VerRaise, you can be rough with one.]
