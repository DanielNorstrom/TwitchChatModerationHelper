[2022-12-19 00:00:42] <heraklit_z_efezu> Hikaru, stop this nonsense talking, and just say deeeep true, like our best chess player, Hans N "Chess speaks for themself" and LEAVE. Kappa

[2022-12-19 00:01:08] <+radjedi2020> don't agree with that. Federer's shotmaking was better than anyone in the top 100.  Nadal's speed and anticipation were likewise.

[2022-12-19 00:02:58] <+radjedi2020> Magnus said he doesn't look at Hikaru because he got tricked once when Hikaru pretended he was upset over a blunder, but it was actually a trap.

To some extent are some players just "born with it" in having some sort of immediate intuition?

[2022-12-19 15:03:04] <+carolinamike83> Hikaru basically went into prevent defense mode after that 5+1 smackdown. Almost backfired, but he won the games he needed in bullet under pressure.

[2022-12-19 15:07:55] <gowatchnickeh30> I have excuses for Magnus becuase y’all are saying he got clapped. The fact is Hikaru won by one point. Hikaru has played 30 times the amount of speed games and has practice like crazy. Magnus is hardly sober and was wearing a hood. Love Hikaru

[2022-12-19 15:22:04] <dentils> The Magnus effect is an observable phenomenon commonly associated with a spinning object moving through a fluid. The path of the spinning object is deflected in a manner not present when the object is not spinning. The deflection can be explained by the difference in pressure of the fluid on opposite sides of the spinning object. The Magnus effect is dependent on the speed of rotation.

[2022-12-19 15:32:19] <chesmaniac> Magnus was not as sharp tactically

[2022-12-19 15:32:26] <%+ccarrionsantiago> It is amazing how in the prematch prediction, the odds were 50 - 50%, but even though Hikaru got the advantage in 5 + 1, the statistics didn't fail because they got tied in a certain point later in time. After 5 + 1, the adjusted prediction was like 52 - 48%, and the match ended near like that. It was a great match.

[2022-12-19 16:16:32] <tovion> I always think its almost disrespectufll not using the time to your advantage as you dont do your best to win. Which coud mean you dont think your opponent is good enough to make you do your best.

[2022-12-19 17:22:56] <ddave42> Anyway, according to Smullyan, the last official change in rules occurred in the 1800s.  The previous rule stated that a promoted pawn could become any piece except the king or a pawn.  The rule had to be amended, stating that a promoted pawn could become any piece of the same color, except the king or a pawn.
