[2023-01-07 03:16:00] <%bigchunk4530> it is supposed to be homogenized no?
[2023-01-07 03:16:05] <SteveFrenchHS> cooking and boiling is also a process Kappa

[2023-01-07 03:16:15] <+reaperonetho> i think i drank goat's raw milk in the mountain when i was a child, but i'm not sure it was raw

[2023-01-07 03:16:24] <rekinom> Depends on what process is being used on what. Modern dairy farms *have* to pasturize the milk to make it safe, or you'd die because of how dirty those farms are

[2023-01-07 05:42:40] <+kingofkings1532x> Imbalance particularly hurts ftp or casual players who don‚Äôt buy 500 card packs every expansion, and can only build a few decks
[2023-01-07 05:42:47] <%haoxus_wayne> I don't think power creep is good, because it nullify hero power, which makes drawing cards on curve more important

[2023-01-07 05:48:51] <senikis> I mean, people do vote with their wallets. What we may or may not like is reflected by profits. At any rate, balancing isn't as easy as people like to make it out to be but they probably do very much notice when the game feels boring/bad to the general player

[2023-01-07 05:59:40] <%Slider_HS> @NoHandsGamer What I personnally find frustrating is even if you try to play as perfectly as possible, you may still lose, and even if you know the concept of variance, it's still frustrating, I think. Psychological issue haha

[2023-01-07 06:31:53] <grimBleeper> @bigchunk4530 if gambling laws prohibit you from spending money on gambling like packs then you can make people buy runestones and use that to get around gambling laws

[2023-01-07 06:32:52] <%bigchunk4530> but the gold is free so your not paying for the gamble with runestones you are paying for the gamble now...am i correct in that assumption?

[2023-01-07 06:33:56] <grimBleeper> @bigchunk4530 true but you can get more people to spend money if you take away the things you want to spend gold on and replace that with runestones, by giving uses of runestones, you can say that the runestones aren't just for directly enabling gambling

[2023-01-07 06:46:10] <arcawarchief> @ThisIsChrisHS ahh I see, deal 8 more becomes the text of the original battlecry

[2023-01-07 06:46:12] <%infinite_penguins> 8 mana astalor's manathirst is special in that it upgrades the battlecry

[2023-01-07 06:46:40] <ThisIsChrisHS> @jwpaps yeahthats true, 2 workds that way, 3 the other way, cause 3 manathirst effects the battlecry

[2023-01-07 06:47:07] <arcawarchief> so it transforms the battlecry from deal 8 dmg to deal 16 dmg

[2023-01-07 06:47:44] <+ForgottenOrb> branns double some manathirsts and not others, depending on the specific wording. when it's an "instead", brann doubles it
[2023-01-07 06:47:47] <%Lvl_100_Magikarp> it should be allowed to show your opponent your hand so they know when to concede right away

[2023-01-07 06:51:35] <%Slider_HS> As a "perfectionist" sometimes, I find it frustrating that some games are just 100% win according to draws. The opponent cannot do anything. Feels good when it happens to you, but the opposite is not fun. Gotta accept it I know, but removes "fun" about "skill" in games you know
[2023-01-07 06:51:47] <%rexmkh> everything that no hands doesn't play should be nerfed
[2023-01-07 06:52:09] <+ForgottenOrb> even in chess, sometimes your opponent has luckily prepared a counter to your opening

[2023-01-07 08:05:29] <%Slider_HS> Ok, check some local boxing clubs and see for yourself, if you feel it like going there or not ;-) It's important
[2023-01-07 08:05:47] <+reaperonetho> @NoHandsGamer  can you explain how do the right click works for you??
[2023-01-07 08:05:53] <%+jerry_34_> why throw away wincon D:
[2023-01-07 08:06:08] <teleblock> @slider_hs I'm just unsure about the whole kickboxing, MMA, taekwondo, all the other variants compared to boxing... it's overwhelming
[2023-01-07 08:06:50] <Yaya_> have they even played a weapon
[2023-01-07 08:06:54] <grimBleeper> @teleblock if you're starting combat sports then stick to whatever is most affordable for you then explore outwards and keep an open mind but you should start somewhere and have a good time and feel safe
[2023-01-07 08:07:04] <%Slider_HS> I understand, just try a "trial" lesson in any thing you'd like to try, and check for yourself. Most clubs to that. So you have a better sight of what fits you best
[2023-01-07 08:07:07] <teleblock> I just want to get over nice workout and punch something. maybe kick some thing if it's efficient lol

[2023-01-07 08:08:06] <%Slider_HS> At the time you get much better, you can switch for another fighting style if you see fit

[2023-01-07 08:08:31] <%$Onyrius> I believe fighting sports are not great for your brain in the long run
[2023-01-07 08:08:32] <%Slider_HS> But until that, you have quite a long way to go ;-) "Mastering" a style takes so much time and commitment
[2023-01-07 08:09:06] <Yaya_> legend player confirmed
[2023-01-07 08:09:13] <teleblock> @reaperonetho but does kickboxing involve a lot of boxing too?
[2023-01-07 08:09:16] <grimBleeper> @Onyrius yeah, tell your partners to not kick and punch you in the head because you don't want to develop cte or go to work with a concussion and they'll understand

[2023-01-07 08:10:06] <%Slider_HS> @Onyrius @Onyrius You're right, but it depends how you train. For me for example I just train to learn the bsics, hit bags, and sweat :-) I don't get hit (or very very soft) and don't plan to go Professional or the like. So no brain damage.

[2023-01-07 08:52:59] <%$Onyrius> @torrenaxe how about bran Astolor anubarak? Is that a ‚Äútypical blizzard combo‚Äù?
[2023-01-07 08:53:00] <%snaktray> @Danjerous they'll probably nerf the cards around it. like shadowstep
[2023-01-07 08:53:09] <+Salty1337> they will nerf astalor instead of hitting brann. they always nerf around brann

[2023-01-07 08:53:53] <CheekyApe> nerf brann, amirite
[2023-01-07 08:54:02] <%+Danjerous> na i bet money they dont touch it
[2023-01-07 08:54:03] <%Lvl_100_Magikarp> it‚Äôs a neutral card abused by 60% of decks, there‚Äôs no chance it doesn‚Äôt get touched
[2023-01-07 08:54:06] <+IVIugginz> Im surprised planted evidence makes the cut in the 30 card version
[2023-01-07 08:54:07] <%bigchunk4530> nerf rogue naga

[2023-01-07 08:54:24] <%JonsyBones> If Blizzard doesn't deal with Astalor, I will....
[2023-01-07 08:54:26] <%$Onyrius> @torrenaxe my bad I just didn‚Äôt catch it, you‚Äôre not dumb
[2023-01-07 08:54:44] <%+Danjerous> well if your going to play this deck the time in now
[2023-01-07 08:54:44] <+Salty1337> @Danjerous they will. team 5 loves brann they rather nerf everything else but the true problem. they wont touch it. expect an astalor nerf because its in almost every deck
[2023-01-07 08:55:01] <%Lvl_100_Magikarp> going by their nerf philosophy it‚Äôs a nobrainer
[2023-01-07 08:55:14] <%bigchunk4530> they gonna nerf the final form of astor

[2023-01-07 08:55:47] <+SpaceMonkey3000> Astalor will not get touched before next expansion
[2023-01-07 08:55:49] <%abandonment7> makes sense
[2023-01-07 08:55:57] <%JonsyBones> Me good. Opponent bad. Thoughts?
[2023-01-07 08:55:59] <pepefrogqt> astalor would be fine if brann didnt exist
[2023-01-07 08:56:03] <%+Danjerous> yeah cora said its not going to go anywhere until rotation in april
[2023-01-07 08:56:06] <%$Onyrius> Brann is just for fun, just to spike up the variance in games guys, it‚Äôs a brilliant way to get more out of the same set of cards
[2023-01-07 08:56:09] <%+Danjerous> they do love their brann
[2023-01-07 08:56:09] <+IVIugginz> Planted evidence really better than raid boss?
[2023-01-07 08:56:17] <pepefrogqt> brann needs to be removed asap
[2023-01-07 08:56:18] <Peri_HS> remove brann from standard..and everything wil be fine
[2023-01-07 08:56:21] <+biesanu> he's gonna cream with scale
[2023-01-07 08:56:24] <%monie1127> Sup @nohandsgamer so is this a draw as many cards till you get that spicy combo type of deck?
