[2023-01-05 03:45:57] <%XIII_Aether> I know AVGN did a reading of a megaman book but it was pre recorded on YT so it’s most likely different

[2023-01-05 07:37:18] <%XIII_Aether> Streams become unenjoyable to watch when streamer isn’t enjoying it. As long as you’re happy and your health is good, we’re happy. You, saeko, chubbs, fleshy, and a couple more have this REALLY good community and cozy vibes where every stream feels like a vacation from our stressful lives. ezeggHeart ezeggHeart ezeggHeart ezeggHeart ezeggHeart ezeggHeart
[2023-01-05 07:37:39] <arcticpyro_> better health and rest makes for a better stream so if ya gotta take a day or stream less  ok
[2023-01-05 07:37:59] <%Jaccquee> Honestly starting stream at a consistent time is more impactful in my mind than streaming for a long time
[2023-01-05 07:38:01] <%$nemafow> I just wanna see Egg be Egg

[2023-01-05 07:38:15] <Acrdys14> covid definitely was an opportunity. its basically how i found my streamers to watch
[2023-01-05 07:38:28] <!%$CoopKaiju> Team Egg though
[2023-01-05 07:38:35] <@%chairthrowingtim> Eggs off-site content is quality and brings in people
[2023-01-05 07:38:36] <@%$AJ_Hyper_Bit> Yeah, having time for you to get shit done, or even just time to connect with you outside of stream would be nice sometimes KEKW
[2023-01-05 07:38:49] <%+Elucet> @Jaccquee Pretty sure Cohh said the same thing. He was more successful when he was consistent.

[2023-01-05 07:40:15] <@%$AJ_Hyper_Bit> It'd be nice to grab you for a couple hours too to try to troubleshoot the stream stuff, or to setup the AI TTS again, would be nice if you had the time KEKW
[2023-01-05 07:40:18] <%Jaccquee> From my own personal experience as a viewer, having a consistent start time makes it really convenient to watch streams

[2023-01-05 07:45:31] <%Jaccquee> Agreed
[2023-01-05 07:45:32] <!%$DarkRaigeFire> Depression doesn't need a good reason, it is an illnesss just like the flu
[2023-01-05 07:45:35] <%JBookwyrm> One streamer I follow does 2 shorter streams a day which could be an option some days of the week
[2023-01-05 07:45:41] <!%$DarkRaigeFire> the way you say things matters when it comes to that
[2023-01-05 07:45:43] <%Jaccquee> Also what aj said
[2023-01-05 07:45:43] <%$nemafow> Yeah you are really bummed out with the twitch bullshit, we can see that
[2023-01-05 07:45:46] <%MxBroccoli> there is no such a thing as "reason to be depressed" its just a shit thing that happens

[2023-01-05 07:46:52] <%Jaccquee> It's not about the source
[2023-01-05 07:47:04] <%Jaccquee> Or lack there of
[2023-01-05 07:47:11] <%MxBroccoli> sometimes depression can be another untreated problem, had friends going through everything they could for depression and solving the issue with treating adhd lol
[2023-01-05 07:47:14] <%$leeman225> I mean tricking the mind to work hard and stay positive is a good thing
