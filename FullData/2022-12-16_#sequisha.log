[2022-12-16 06:16:19] <%+Malkazzz1> It's always feast or famine with games right ? @Sequisha
[2022-12-16 06:16:21] <%+Hazonku> Yeah Dwarf Fortress falls into that same real as EVE for me. A game shouldn't feel making sure you put the new covers on your TPS reports.
[2022-12-16 06:16:25] <%+muy_caliente> Ixion is apparently more of a puzzle game, which is a shame cuz it looked like a cool colony sim

[2022-12-16 06:43:37] <%FatalExodusX> Wartales is a solid game. I'm excited for Dark and Darker though.
[2022-12-16 06:43:55] <%$emofelinesad> ... waiting room @Gavly heh
[2022-12-16 06:44:27] <%Gavly> @emofelinesad listen man, i don't want to start any beef
[2022-12-16 06:45:04] <%$emofelinesad> no, this is like a lobby for d and d
[2022-12-16 06:45:23] <%Gavly> i will fight to defend myself
[2022-12-16 06:48:26] <%SporkTheWorld> I still say the best item in the game is the Salt Scoop.
[2022-12-16 06:48:29] <%SporkTheWorld> You can't change my mind.
[2022-12-16 06:49:06] <%+Malkazzz1> So what do ponys do exactly ? Expand your carrying capacity ?
[2022-12-16 06:49:30] <%SporkTheWorld> Carry more stuff and potentially be war ponies.
[2022-12-16 06:49:42] <%SporkTheWorld> But if they're war ponies, they can't carry nearly as much.
[2022-12-16 06:50:03] <%+Malkazzz1> Got yha @SporkTheWorld
[2022-12-16 06:50:07] <+maserati12> do you guys think this game will go on sale on steam for christmas? i want to play this !
[2022-12-16 06:50:37] <%SporkTheWorld> Cheapest I've seen it is 10% off. So, probably not with a big discount if at all @maserati12
[2022-12-16 06:50:46] <%SporkTheWorld> BUT... it's only a few days away, if you can wait.
[2022-12-16 06:50:49] <%+Malkazzz1> Just keep it in your wishlist and i'm sure it will eventually @maserati12
[2022-12-16 06:51:31] <%+Malkazzz1> To be fair, it's worth the 35$ it's set at now
[2022-12-16 06:51:39] <%JimmerOG> God damn 3k times are good right now huh? @sequisha
[2022-12-16 06:51:45] <+AllOutOfEnemies1> whats max level, 20?
[2022-12-16 06:52:22] <%SporkTheWorld> You'll kit up in no time, so many merchants in that area.
[2022-12-16 06:52:41] <%SporkTheWorld> 12 is the highest level with any skills @AllOutOfEnemies1
[2022-12-16 06:52:48] <%SporkTheWorld> but they're still coming out with shit
[2022-12-16 06:53:39] <%SporkTheWorld> Man, I hate fire damage in this game. And it spreads everywhere.
[2022-12-16 06:54:31] <damngoodbreakfast> is this an outlaw playthrough
[2022-12-16 06:54:32] <%SporkTheWorld> And the crocswine.
[2022-12-16 06:55:07] <%SporkTheWorld> He steals and kills, but not constantly @damngoodbreakfast
[2022-12-16 06:55:59] <%SporkTheWorld> I had my rogue go in and decimate a crowd of crocswine that was fighting some lawmen. He noped out at the end of the turn. In ONE turn, the lawmen dude was destroyed by like 7 stacks of mosquitos.
[2022-12-16 06:56:06] <%SporkTheWorld> They're rough.

[2022-12-16 07:49:46] <%Saren42> oof, mange sucks... parvo required a weeks stay at the vet, with IV plasma from parvo immunized dogs, and fluids, was very expensive for a shelter pup, but money doesn't matter, we got to save an amazing pupper
[2022-12-16 07:49:53] <adhdandrea> all of my childhood pups were strays. my mother was huge on helping every animal she could. It definitely stuck with me because all of the pets I have now are either adopted or taken in from friends that couldn't keep them. Seeing you stop everything for that announcement reminded me of something she would do, youre the man seq

[2022-12-16 07:54:21] <%Saren42> @GeekeryCollective I'm happy to hear that, my pup (his name is Tesla), got it at 6-7 weeks, animal control got him off the street
[2022-12-16 07:55:26] <%Saren42> yeah, I told the vet not to give us the odds, cause... I was dealing with some stuff at the time, I couldn't handle it, I got so attached to him so quick, before I even brought him home, cause the first thing he did when he interacted with me, was nom my hand, lol

[2022-12-16 09:33:45] <%+DayXP> i was on youtube.. yeah twitch ads are very rare this year. like 3-4 i would guess. sad cause is disables everything which could block it
[2022-12-16 09:34:09] <+Sam_Hall_> I'm highly considering getting turbo so I can support my favorite streamers through ad revenue without having to sub to so many lol

[2022-12-16 09:35:43] <%faxwell_modemus> yeah streamers still get the ad revenue from Turbo
[2022-12-16 09:35:46] <%ChobPT> it counts as an ad impression even if you don't see the ad
[2022-12-16 09:35:53] <%faxwell_modemus> checked about a week ago
[2022-12-16 09:36:25] <+OneInchMan87> if twitch made turbo regional currency prices, I'd get it
[2022-12-16 09:36:29] <+Sam_Hall_> okay, thanks for verifying guys
[2022-12-16 09:36:33] <%$MTVaughn> turbo counts as a ad viewer

[2022-12-16 20:38:54] <%Dr_DD0S> you have to do more lootin and scooting as a solo in this game

[2022-12-16 20:41:03] <melodiousthonkvi> pbtvPOP so…guilds are out of the equation? Would make it super competitive?

[2022-12-16 20:43:29] <sikovit> the game just isn't designed or balanced well enough for 1v3/4. movement is too slow for a solo to outplay in most cases. unless they get the opening strike

[2022-12-16 20:54:57] <%+TheNightSquatch> @sikovit the Gun play is much better than it looks. Really fun game, although they nerfed damage players take when their ship is being shot when disabled. Which I think is a massive mistake. Makes ship fights pointless.
