[2023-01-05 09:15:12] <@%+Jonno107> That's exciting
[2023-01-05 09:16:30] <Redronn> ANNOUNCEMENT: he's not flushing Fable? retroSMILE
[2023-01-05 09:18:16] <%$Zencodion> @Jonno107 what up retro7
[2023-01-05 09:18:44] <@%+Jonno107> @Zencodion Hey retroHI

[2023-01-05 09:32:29] <%TurtleExpress> Huge announcement PauseChamp
[2023-01-05 09:33:29] <%ZombieDodgeKing> how HUGE though? retroHMM
[2023-01-05 09:33:42] <%ZombieDodgeKing> super huuuuge? or mega huuuuge?
[2023-01-05 09:34:02] <!%+Nbg13> i am guessing it is what he said in Discord LUL
[2023-01-05 09:34:02] <%TurtleExpress> He loved Germany so much he's going to move there instead of Ohio PepeLaugh
[2023-01-05 09:34:15] <%TurtleExpress> What did he say on Discord?
[2023-01-05 09:34:36] <!%+Nbg13> he is planning to move back to Ohio 1st March
[2023-01-05 09:34:40] <%ZombieDodgeKing> so this is the beginning of the German Arc it seems retroHMM
[2023-01-05 09:34:53] <%TurtleExpress> Oh, that's pretty soon already
[2023-01-05 09:35:12] <%$Zencodion> okay announcement over peepoLeave

[2023-01-05 09:35:50] <%ZombieDodgeKing> retroHMM
[2023-01-05 09:35:57] <!%+Nbg13> LUL
[2023-01-05 09:36:05] <%TurtleExpress> LUL
[2023-01-05 09:36:24] <!%+Nbg13> there might bew other news, who knows
[2023-01-05 09:36:38] <!%+Nbg13> be*
[2023-01-05 09:36:43] <%TurtleExpress> Maybe he's pregnant monkaHmm
[2023-01-05 09:36:48] <!%+Nbg13> but it wasn't confirmed, so who knows
[2023-01-05 09:37:50] <!%+Nbg13> or perhaps the announcement is New Year, New Retro and he is un-flushing FF VIII
[2023-01-05 09:38:48] <%TurtleExpress> I think him being pregnant is more likely tbh
[2023-01-05 09:39:03] <@%+Jonno107> @Zencodion It was ok. Hope you are doing alright!

[2023-01-05 12:54:00] <%+HouseOfPaincake> One of my biggest regrets on pet owning was not getting my Corgi a pupper friend. She's gotten pretty territorial so we don't know if introducing a new dog is a good idea.

[2023-01-05 14:40:52] <FrostedZaibatsu> Sekiro was a short game with not much depth. Compared to the others

[2023-01-05 14:43:40] <Oppai_Nani> I would probably delete dark souls or elden ring
[2023-01-05 14:43:42] <!+Bonsense24> And now that I got tieka got a ps5 I’ll play blood borne

[2023-01-05 16:17:16] <@%+Sotenbori> The other games past Chaos Theory can be fun, but they're also loaded with problems at the same time- at least if you look deep into them
[2023-01-05 16:17:27] <@%+Sotenbori> I guess if you're just going into them casually without being too analytical, you definitely can enjoy them
