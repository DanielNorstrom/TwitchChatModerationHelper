I had an interesting discussion with ollelito couple days ago about Vejrgang and about the fact that can he already be considered one of the greatest of all time even tho he hasn't won any huge LAN-events YET. I thought that yes absolutely, he didn't agree with me, your thoughts? I mean after all Anders would be able to beat any pro right now...?
