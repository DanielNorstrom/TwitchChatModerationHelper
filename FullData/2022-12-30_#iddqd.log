[2022-12-30 09:37:34] <llawliet0819> i feel like support needs something else to compensate ( more damage/ more utility) if you take away some healing ( if you think they heal too much now). support already has a identity crisis because people thinks they are healer and support would have even worse experience if you do take away some healing
[2022-12-30 09:37:42] <%Clapts> I feel like headshots are easier on the ground
[2022-12-30 09:37:52] <llawliet0819> they need something to be shown they have impact to the game
[2022-12-30 09:37:53] <%Clapts> because you can aim at head level

[2022-12-30 09:39:34] <%+mademedothis_> I abuse it
[2022-12-30 09:39:35] <%+DINOBURP> someone told me on ground level you only have to move on the x axis and on high you have to do both
[2022-12-30 09:39:37] <Dragskope> On controller shoting down is the hardest. Btw i think this gameplay  is console

[2022-12-30 09:39:46] <underscorePlatform> when you're on an equal level, you only have to worry about their left and right movement, if you're above them you also have to compensate for their forward and backward movement
[2022-12-30 09:39:46] <%shruggy08> i agree with that just being able to aim at head level on high ground is harder for me
[2022-12-30 09:39:47] <tanto_17> head box to body ratio is bigger when looking down

[2022-12-30 09:40:10] <cynderissuper> yo idd do i put what i think is my mmr rank or do i put what im placed rn btw @iddqd
[2022-12-30 09:40:11] <StephanieRara> I'm bad but, I struggle aiming on high ground because of more y axis aiming. But that's on me.

[2022-12-30 10:04:01] <%+hajdzik> it depends on location probably
[2022-12-30 10:04:01] <%alenaistyping> most of ads are region based

[2022-12-30 10:04:27] <%ephillet> depends on the ad
[2022-12-30 10:04:28] <VizeTY> You can still type while having an ad?
[2022-12-30 10:04:31] <+weetgeenhenk> 10-30 seconds
[2022-12-30 10:04:32] <valeska143> yes 30sec always

[2022-12-30 10:04:32] <%fatpig1826> no
[2022-12-30 10:04:33] <Tophs_98> It’s based on the last time you watched an ad not when the streamer plays it
[2022-12-30 10:04:35] <%LadyBlackRoseWolfe> hey :D
[2022-12-30 10:04:35] <%fatpig1826> sometime longer
[2022-12-30 10:04:35] <lady_barlos> Yes
[2022-12-30 10:04:36] <blamjammy> 15 to 30 sec
[2022-12-30 10:04:36] <Fair_Squared> Nah its fairly random
[2022-12-30 10:04:37] <%ishaan221> some are minutes
[2022-12-30 10:04:39] <+impalapig> usually 3 or so 30 second ones

[2022-12-30 10:04:43] <%fatpig1826> I got min ads before
[2022-12-30 10:04:43] <%shruggy08> no before it was like 2 minutes when i was not subbed
[2022-12-30 10:04:44] <lomaaan> Nop can be up to 2 min
[2022-12-30 10:04:57] <lady_barlos> Really
[2022-12-30 10:04:57] <uniAdapter> they can go up to 8 ads of 30s

[2022-12-30 10:05:03] <Fair_Squared> Im sure it based on stream engagement and size. top 3 streamers tend to have around 5-7 ads at a time when they show up
[2022-12-30 10:05:06] <Eclipse_ow24> mine was literally ten seconds

[2022-12-30 10:05:45] <+impalapig> odd.. seagull uses the button to force ads at his timing and I never get others
[2022-12-30 10:05:45] <gentle6hilt> ads even within regions where you can't buy products from that add

[2022-12-30 12:29:25] <Mefisto42> The Ana on this team is so good
[2022-12-30 12:29:31] <%+ALEXEATSOREOS> it is Just Kiriko
[2022-12-30 12:29:53] <%+Danielmm77> kirirko makes hog gud
[2022-12-30 12:29:54] <%brokenbeachchair> No other tank can 1 shot

[2022-12-30 12:29:57] <%Devils_Angel636> Seems like I need to focus on the blocking more with ult and staying on the enemy and squish while keeping my back not open

[2022-12-30 12:30:10] <Mefisto42> Exactly, hog has not received any changes since ow 2 release, people need to realize that other balance changes affect the whole roster in one way or the other

[2022-12-30 12:30:32] <%CHICKEN2XD> But most counters of hog is with Ana though. Making this bad because Ana is dogshit with lack of so much mobility
[2022-12-30 12:30:37] <%crocodile69420> even worse
[2022-12-30 12:30:40] <%winskill06> @Devils_Angel636 i would say yes you do, especailly in a full team fight.
[2022-12-30 12:30:41] <%steptoaster_> I’m a ana 1 trick but if my tank goes hog I lock kiriko
[2022-12-30 12:30:54] <Mefisto42> The balance team is going to murder Hog, they really have no credibility
[2022-12-30 12:31:00] <eff0rt_ow> even with cleans tho hes not that good
[2022-12-30 12:31:05] <+yaboiobz> nah he was an ult charge in OW1,  with the changes to ult charge from hitting tanks, no tank is an ult battery anymore
[2022-12-30 12:31:07] <jhonnythesinner> @Mefisto42 fair
[2022-12-30 12:31:09] <%winskill06> ana nade dead

[2022-12-30 12:34:11] <h2oaddict28> couldn't they just nerf the mercy boost, and fix sojour, pharah and ashe at the same time?
[2022-12-30 12:34:11] <girthygary__> Same with genji except he still is mid
[2022-12-30 12:34:13] <BormahTiid> @mefisto42 nah we nerf Genji

[2022-12-30 12:38:50] <+ScrubDharma> There is a big misunderstanding about aiming and playing properly. Aim is a thing but positioning, learning comps and playing around your team is something else imo
[2022-12-30 12:39:05] <%+mirasweetheart> HOneslty to nerf suzu, remove the healing effect from it, the aoe cleanse and knockback and make it for single target, keep the invurn, @iddqd
[2022-12-30 12:39:13] <jhonnythesinner> @FailedVenture69 zen is supposed to be glass cannon tho
[2022-12-30 12:39:18] <%winskill06> @FailedVenture69 i agree, unless you hit 90% of your shots zen is useless
[2022-12-30 12:39:19] <RiftaHere> Ana's nade doesn't nullify every fcking ability and ultimate in the game..

[2022-12-30 12:41:41] <Mefisto42> @jhonnythesinner I never said it was easy, and that's precisely the reason why this game it's interesting, the thing is, like ID pointed out for example, Hog was never the problem, he did not receive any changes, it was the introduction of Kiriko, so what does the balance team do? Get rid of the classic one shot combo of hog, same story with Doomfist, it's funny how destroy their own work instead of looking for other solutions
[2022-12-30 12:41:43] <%+steaknegggs> kirikos main attack thogh is so weak cos suzu so strong

[2022-12-30 12:42:40] <MrTeall> @mefisto42 just cos hog wasn’t meta before kiriko came doesn’t mean the easiest one shot in the game isn’t a problem though
[2022-12-30 12:42:46] <%FailedVenture69> @riptid3 doesn't change the fact you hit ALL your teammates
[2022-12-30 12:42:52] <%+steaknegggs> hog should have super long vape heal, or change vape to poisonous gas emissions or something
[2022-12-30 12:42:56] <%FailedVenture69> you negate like 80% of current ults
[2022-12-30 12:43:00] <%FailedVenture69> with a 14s cd

[2022-12-30 12:43:04] <%FailedVenture69> and that is bullshit
[2022-12-30 12:43:07] <riptid3> so does immo field
[2022-12-30 12:43:12] <%+steaknegggs> its getting him down to one, then that gdmn vape heal and a pocket healer blasts him back to max and i scream

[2022-12-30 12:43:28] <+SplashbangOW> @steaknegggs Remove it and add an ability where he farts and create a toxic cloud around him. Sounds more fitting.
[2022-12-30 12:43:30] <Mefisto42> @MrTeall it's been like that since 2016, what changed? The most boring times for hog have been when he didn't one shot stuff, it's going to be same story all over again

[2022-12-30 12:43:40] <jhonnythesinner> @Mefisto42 I understand ur sentiment but hog was still good in ow1 and will always be viable with his one shot ability
[2022-12-30 12:43:41] <RiftaHere> @riptid3 No, Suzu needs to do less and have the same or a lower cd. Ability's need less impact and be available a little more oftenm

[2022-12-30 12:43:51] <riptid3> it lets them live with anti heal until it's gone
[2022-12-30 12:43:58] <%+ALEXEATSOREOS> @winskill06 really? I have the opposite issue. Valorant games go on for so long and are so tiring
[2022-12-30 12:44:08] <Mefisto42> @MrTeall Here it comes, spoiler alert, hog it's going to be useless, it's going to be boring for like 4 5 months, and they are going to buff him again some way

[2022-12-30 12:44:26] <%FailedVenture69> I would lower the cd of Suzu from 14s to 10-12 and lower the targets from ALL to 1-2

[2022-12-30 12:44:43] <%+TSgtSeuss> @BormahTiid A good rule of thumb, watch one of your VODs back, and time how long it takes each character to earn their ult, and that's a good guess to go by
