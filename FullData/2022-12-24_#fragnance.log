[2022-12-24 17:03:58] <%+devilbride> in max´s stream there was a giga shitstorm against echo because they won. the limit-fanboys said  "they would´ve never reach wf without that nerf.."
[2022-12-24 17:04:09] <@%Ashlinex> financially method probably is better of than echo
[2022-12-24 17:04:15] <%+devilbride> but which nerf was it? i didn´t see a bluepost O.o

[2022-12-24 17:05:31] <+zippiz23> Liquid basicallly tests all the bosses forst so Echo doesn't have to
[2022-12-24 17:05:47] <%AirsGaming> i mean echo were ahead pretty much the entire last fight
[2022-12-24 17:06:04] <+zippiz23> and the hotfix yesterday definetly helped Echo. Liquid was sleeping when it went live
[2022-12-24 17:06:13] <Fragtt> Always wondered how does he not have wrists injuries
[2022-12-24 17:06:17] <%AirsGaming> and it still took them many more pulls than echo post nerf
[2022-12-24 17:06:18] <SoSalti> if starting behind was an advantage, Liquid would do it. But they don't so that argument is complete dogshit.
[2022-12-24 17:06:29] <%+devilbride> they only cannot accept, that EU has the better players xD so thats why they´re angry bout their 2nd win..

[2022-12-24 17:07:03] <%+devilbride> @zippiz23 the fan-boys of Liquid^^
[2022-12-24 17:07:04] <%+Misasam> or the last 3 if u talk about sepulcher
[2022-12-24 17:07:08] <malicrin> that's not a serious comment from a mod about a full day advantage right lmao
[2022-12-24 17:07:19] <%AirsGaming> say that to the last 15+ years of eu beating na at wf
[2022-12-24 17:07:23] <%AirsGaming> without streams
[2022-12-24 17:07:42] <+zippiz23> I dont think anyone is angry. Just said Echo and Liquid are light years ahead of everyone else is all
[2022-12-24 17:07:51] <@%Ashlinex> why wouldnt it be a serious comment

[2022-12-24 17:08:49] <%+Misasam> the nerf was 8am NA time announced and went live 10am. Liquid slept longer coz they played into the night the day before
[2022-12-24 17:08:58] <%+Misasam> not EU/Blizz fault
[2022-12-24 17:09:17] <@%Ashlinex> I mean even then
[2022-12-24 17:09:24] <@%Ashlinex> liquid took like 6 hours after the nerf
[2022-12-24 17:09:30] <+Sinwee_> Do people think Aisan guilds are just to far behind to stand a chance?
[2022-12-24 17:09:30] <@%Ashlinex> while echo killed it in that hour
[2022-12-24 17:09:43] <malicrin> im not here to argue that liquid should have won. echo won. echo played better. echo deserved it.
[2022-12-24 17:09:49] <Boorzy> @zippiz23 Are you actually beliving that yourself?
[2022-12-24 17:09:49] <weedyz> @Ashlinex not even, they killed it the very next pull
[2022-12-24 17:09:50] <malicrin> the full day advantage comment is a separate issue
[2022-12-24 17:09:56] <+Serebus> @Sinwee_ i think so yeah, which is a shame because they're cracked
[2022-12-24 17:09:59] <+rollstuhljoe> there were plently of nerfs when echo went to bed in the past
[2022-12-24 17:10:05] <+DoctorXtreme> echo clearly played better on the last boss

[2022-12-24 17:10:21] <malicrin> you're now changing the discusison by saying "well post nerf echo killed it faster". thats a brand new conversation from "1 full day advantage:
[2022-12-24 17:10:26] <+Serebus> Im pretty sure the shield nerf happened as echo went to bed

[2022-12-24 21:55:30] <@%Ashlinex> tbh one other issue I have right now is
[2022-12-24 21:55:35] <@%Ashlinex> there is no real short dungeon
[2022-12-24 21:55:44] <qweekWOW> yeah, too bad people doesn't seem to agree and are applauding blizzard being lazy and not creating content for us

[2022-12-24 21:56:24] <@%Ashlinex> if every dungeon is 40ish minutes that brings burnout real quick

[2022-12-24 22:01:28] <qweekWOW> the biggest thing with legion is that it was new so people didn't know what to expect either
[2022-12-24 22:01:34] <@%Ashlinex> there wasnt really a lot of dungeons where you wouldnt like to go
[2022-12-24 22:01:42] <@%Ashlinex> like seat was dog

[2022-12-24 22:04:43] <@%Ashlinex> kind of a weird statement to make
[2022-12-24 22:05:02] <@%Ashlinex> final fantasy is a mmo and has 8 man raids

[2022-12-24 22:05:17] <ergabrowen> nah it only has 7 raids

[2022-12-24 22:05:50] <+JaayKaaay> mmo doesnt imply you have to group with everyone in the game
[2022-12-24 22:05:57] <@%Ashlinex> there isnt 20 people that you like

[2022-12-24 22:06:11] <Omni35> seems wierd

[2022-12-24 22:33:07] <prestkenth> Actually i take it back, its not. Wireless wins.
[2022-12-24 22:33:30] <prestkenth> You win, dog! Me and s1mple can't compete with you bruda

[2022-12-24 22:34:57] <%+DeltaSSK> thing is that a wireless mouse today is almost no different compared to an wired if you buy a good one. downside is that it is capabale of getting delay or die bcs of battery or something that cc's the bluetooth and make it disconnect etc and you dont want that when you play. especially not high tier player in any game
