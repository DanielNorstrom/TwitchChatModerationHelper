[2023-01-11 14:53:35] <%MamaMia9877> I’ve never hit max traders and even I don’t mind the changes.  People are just lazy and don’t want to do the work for the good stuff
[2023-01-11 14:53:36] <matilozano96> It's the scope thing that's a bit dumb imo. They remove the good scopes because people use them because the other ones have issues
[2023-01-11 14:53:40] <+Kyrrros> @Gingy becuase they now have to deal with recoil when shooting alone
[2023-01-11 14:53:43] <%ArsonLt> arena will be their new home
[2023-01-11 14:53:46] <%beardiyo> i was feeling that yea some cod lords crying about how hardcore tarkov is LUL
[2023-01-11 14:53:47] <Vordel> as a total noob only thing i am complaining about atm is that my stash is always full even with eod lol. saving shit for flea

[2023-01-11 14:53:52] <%BTurbo_is_TPC4L> So many people mad that scavs are now actually more difficult.
[2023-01-11 14:53:53] <%MoistPrune2> Last time I checked CoD was still around so they could just go play? LUL
[2023-01-11 14:53:56] <%onetwueduwubie> when things are harder to get, i like the game more. I'm not very good, but when other people aren't able to get things so easily it's more fun to fight
[2023-01-11 14:53:57] <%NoisySharkden> no im from call off duty and im not shittt talking this game im loving it me
[2023-01-11 14:54:07] <lovingthecaine> the people that play more liked it more when stuff was hard to get. the casual players like easier to get stuff
[2023-01-11 14:54:17] <Trenloe> I would like there to be items that you can only find on certain maps
[2023-01-11 14:54:17] <XeaseOG> @Gingy you think it will be possible to only play arena?
[2023-01-11 14:54:24] <Unicorn_Buzz> @Gingy scav??
[2023-01-11 14:54:30] <Xaero86> i see tarkov more rpg than a shooter
[2023-01-11 14:54:31] <+triponurmom> Chads will go to Arena, and normies will have less threats in regular raids.
[2023-01-11 14:54:47] <onlychabo> What a loot haul omg keychain and wallet holy
[2023-01-11 14:54:48] <+Osteee> Arena might ruin the game, Like battleroyale ruined H1Z1
[2023-01-11 14:54:49] <%filet_st_eak> I wonder how Arena will change the Streamer content. Like, will all streamers focus on Arena or will some still play the regular game...
[2023-01-11 14:54:51] <%beardiyo> im casual as F now a days and i like tarkov the way it is :P
[2023-01-11 14:54:54] <+Ogbrog> congrats on the streamer item. it's probably the most useful one yet.

[2023-01-11 14:55:32] <+RYKINX5> prefer to watch tarkov over playing it anyway. i'm a weirdo i guess. but there's something about high skillcap games, and people making them look easy, that i enjoy? like watching tfue destroying people on fortnite kinda for me
[2023-01-11 14:55:38] <Hemmeh> I'm curious, did you get any say about what the item would be? Or any input in the design?
[2023-01-11 14:55:42] <snorlaxxativess> wtf gingy why am i constantly spawning with ur keychain as a scav
[2023-01-11 14:55:50] <%+captf1shyf1nger> @dazedandClowdy gotta love blaming the streamer for twitch stuff

[2023-01-11 14:55:59] <Vordel> bro i am like %150 sure there is not a single streamer who likes ads. its just bad policy of twitch

[2023-01-11 14:56:16] <energie_nb> Hello chat and Gingy! i hope i dont fall asleep cuz its 10am and i havnt slept yet !
[2023-01-11 14:56:19] <%ArsonLt> a new competitive scene will rise from arena especially if it goes into esports, normal tarkov has the streamers who are good at getting kappa arena will have teams and really good pvp streamers
[2023-01-11 14:56:27] <chewepooz> @Vordel why is it bad policy?
[2023-01-11 14:56:42] <+Deckichi> im a casual player never made it pass 24 in 3 wipes played and have been enjoying this wipe its a little harder in some aspects but been doing fine

[2023-01-11 14:56:56] <The_Lost_Prophet> Last wipe everyone had Mutants,M4's with BP and Razors that you could buy nonstop, things need to be limited
[2023-01-11 14:56:58] <%goldenknight22> and buy more $17 855A1 KEK

[2023-01-11 14:57:39] <LoesoeLuukk> lol yea bye asking for subs
[2023-01-11 14:57:46] <BigELive> If Twitch would expand on content and allow creators to monetize that to it would help SO much.
[2023-01-11 14:57:47] <+bucco> is there a set spawn for the skybridge key or completely random, been trying to get it for ages
[2023-01-11 14:57:49] <Vordel> asdfasdf sdf
[2023-01-11 14:57:51] <%filet_st_eak> nowadays Twitch doesn't allow streamers to have NO ads. Twitch is basically forcing ads on everyone
[2023-01-11 14:57:52] <@%+2L33Zy> Drops

[2023-01-11 14:58:40] <%onetwueduwubie> should ask for more subs like twitch prime, usually people do sub a little bit when streamer does.
