[2022-12-10 15:57:05] <eltorrooow> @nepenthez (im dutch) we should have continued playing instead we gave argentina the ball and leaned back, we arent even good at pens normally so nobody in holland understood it
[2022-12-10 15:57:08] <%$EitchBee> @eltorrooow  Watching it live i though it touched by mistake. Watching the replays it seemed intentional. So think the ref might thought it was an unlucky bounce? VAR doesn't intrude in those situations
[2022-12-10 15:57:18] <%LA__2K> Skillz had a great point on cr7 being benched again, He said there is no way ronaldo wanna be subbed off the 60th min at 0-0. so rather him coming of the bench and make the difference

[2022-12-10 16:04:02] <iDersch> @benhowe13 what? underrated= brother, we won the balon d'or a couple years ago. i dont think anyone is underrating modric
[2022-12-10 16:04:05] <Armez__> ronaldo on bench imagine
[2022-12-10 16:04:05] <TheDeerHunterx> Messi
[2022-12-10 16:04:05] <+jancey07> Definitely is for ronaldo
[2022-12-10 16:04:06] <%+brendanmcd8> Ronaldo on the bench - poetic
[2022-12-10 16:04:07] <%AHumanAlien> nah I'd rather England got there
[2022-12-10 16:04:08] <Leexciv> the last dance
[2022-12-10 16:04:12] <%+Golderlight123> If England wins tonight, it be the best early Birthday gift lol - Birthday tomorrow
[2022-12-10 16:04:12] <+htsolna08> yeah
[2022-12-10 16:04:12] <$rojjaaaaa> i'd shed a tear
[2022-12-10 16:04:13] <%$Apple22> but ronaldo would start on the bench LuL
[2022-12-10 16:04:15] <%+609blazers> yeah but ronaldo would be benched lol
[2022-12-10 16:04:17] <+wackyweebo> only if ronaldos not sat on the bench
[2022-12-10 16:04:17] <$Maver28> and then cr7 is benched. imagine that
[2022-12-10 16:04:18] <+htsolna08> its going to happen
[2022-12-10 16:04:18] <%djz19_> messi vs ronaldo showdown sbc
[2022-12-10 16:04:19] <%BobbyTambling> I also agree, but in terms of who deserves it, i think Croatia France again would be ideal
[2022-12-10 16:04:21] <Kassa__> ronaldo would be on the bench
[2022-12-10 16:04:23] <+f1_jacko> yep
[2022-12-10 16:04:25] <polteran316> !song
[2022-12-10 16:04:26] <eltorrooow> @f1_jacko still trying to get the match of yesterday out of my head
[2022-12-10 16:04:27] <Mcr_xMaYheMx> a england win would be better
[2022-12-10 16:04:28] <lbop11> argentina going out next game
[2022-12-10 16:04:29] <%AHumanAlien> Its because its more condensed than normal
[2022-12-10 16:04:43] <+sky_charles> It‚Äôs been a great build up for Christmas
[2022-12-10 16:04:45] <+f1_jacko> @eltorrooow yikes cutie
[2022-12-10 16:04:46] <woolywhite> Croatia vs England will be the final  imo

[2022-12-10 16:04:56] <+Oscarioff94> loving the trim @nepenthez
[2022-12-10 16:04:56] <+jancey07> World Cup been good distracted me for fifa non tent
[2022-12-10 16:04:58] <+james_robertson_> @NepentheZ it wouldn't be good because cr7 would just be on the bench twitter would have a field day
[2022-12-10 16:05:03] <%+Golderlight123> Brazil lost damn
[2022-12-10 16:05:04] <%ItsTr3ple> What matters is, Marseille Toulouse on Dec 29th

[2022-12-10 16:05:12] <+michael2ooo> Don‚Äôt forget the carabo cup resumes in just over a week
[2022-12-10 16:05:15] <eltorrooow> @f1_jacko the ref ruined the match for me
[2022-12-10 16:05:24] <+f1_jacko> @eltorrooow yeah ref was horrible
[2022-12-10 16:05:26] <%jjaden10> Cheeky
[2022-12-10 16:05:30] <+rahulk1988> U got Navas too
[2022-12-10 16:05:31] <%FUTDAN26> Hoping and praying Kyle Walker has the game of his life tonight
[2022-12-10 16:05:33] <%+Brandez84> Groups n last 16 games rushed more than usual, think QF,SF and F are as per normal WC‚Äôs
[2022-12-10 16:05:40] <%+brendanmcd8> goat

[2022-12-10 16:05:48] <+tilehead> I have baby cruyff tradeable should I save up for his mid?
[2022-12-10 16:05:52] <eltorrooow> @f1_jacko we didnt lose bc of the ref but still
[2022-12-10 16:05:55] <+Rileyable> Grinded out the Icon pack for Riquelme, honestly so de-motivated at this point. Last 3 have been Riquelme, Rivaldo and Litmanen. LUL
[2022-12-10 16:06:06] <+f1_jacko> @eltorrooow yeah thats true
[2022-12-10 16:06:09] <MadAimLive> chat i got 20 tokens new to game have no team should i send it for 3x84 ? thoughts ?

[2022-12-10 16:06:14] <%+Golderlight123> @NepentheZ  it was a walkout you just didn't see the  stars in the little area by the  rating on the other side can be a walkout
[2022-12-10 16:06:19] <%+Golderlight123> just wait little longer
[2022-12-10 16:06:20] <%$hazzat1345> That was a chance
[2022-12-10 16:06:21] <+jancey07> Amount of managers leaving once there nation getting knocked out is mental
[2022-12-10 16:06:21] <kilroy188> @madaimlive yes
[2022-12-10 16:06:25] <stackmillz> whats saka down to
[2022-12-10 16:06:26] <+f1_jacko> got to hit the target

[2022-12-10 16:06:30] <+Oscarioff94> fresh trim nello
[2022-12-10 16:06:40] <eltorrooow> @jancey07 its a contract thing mostly
[2022-12-10 16:06:44] <+Oscarioff94> *neppo
[2022-12-10 16:06:48] <%jjaden10> Kerher showed up behind a gold kimmich for me
[2022-12-10 16:06:56] <%ItsTr3ple> Confirmation bias probably, but Matt√©o is amazing in-game
[2022-12-10 16:07:04] <%+Golderlight123> @NepentheZ read my last comment please :)
[2022-12-10 16:07:04] <+jancey07> @eltorrooow Aaah didn‚Äôt no that
[2022-12-10 16:07:07] <%sorarejosh> joao felix BCM already
[2022-12-10 16:07:09] <+noshushing> he just made a crazy save
[2022-12-10 16:07:12] <FeaRLeSS03_BE> @jancey07 Well most of the time the public wants them gone aswell :)
[2022-12-10 16:07:17] <Leexciv> It's really refreshing to see a fifa content creator that doesn't spend half their total mortgage on fifa points lol
[2022-12-10 16:07:22] <prophecygxd> I want that hakimi and pedri.
[2022-12-10 16:07:22] <%$Apple22> yeah save from diving header
[2022-12-10 16:07:29] <+jonte8877> HAKIMI 450k is a ripoff
[2022-12-10 16:07:32] <%+bazzay10> it was an average save
[2022-12-10 16:07:40] <%BobbyTambling> How does 10 world cup goals Lineker have 84 composure...
[2022-12-10 16:07:47] <+philipio1> Or a gerrard
[2022-12-10 16:07:52] <Coolrunnin2018> Is this the RTG
[2022-12-10 16:07:57] <eltorrooow> @jancey07 lots of coaches had a contract untill the end of the wc or euros with an option to extend
[2022-12-10 16:08:01] <+jancey07> Thought Martinez it‚Äôd cb was meant be in this one
[2022-12-10 16:08:02] <GlasgowFIFA> I done 40 yesterday and got 0 walkouts
[2022-12-10 16:08:13] <casualguy_57> @bazzay10 yeah frimpong competes with him that's why I did him
[2022-12-10 16:08:18] <+gwenbruh> I was feeling that as well, ended up getting Casillas :/
[2022-12-10 16:08:51] <+jonte8877> @GlasgowFIFA LUL LUL

[2022-12-10 16:09:04] <+Rileyable> @gwenbruh Did a routlette, got all the way to Brazil Forward, got Rivaldo, wanted to cry ^^
[2022-12-10 16:09:09] <%jjaden10> Rather discard them for 600 coins each
[2022-12-10 16:09:14] <+jancey07> @eltorrooow Wonder what happens with Southgate I‚Äôd love poch but if leaves I can see gerrard or lampard being England manager
[2022-12-10 16:09:25] <royal_flush_dan> I did 50 of these last night. no specials. only 4 walkouts. can not complain though as one of the walkouts was mbappe.
[2022-12-10 16:09:36] <+glowblow_> Portugal playing like an annoying fifa player who only passes to their defender
[2022-12-10 16:09:41] <+gwenbruh> @Rileyable i did a roulette as well hahahha sad man
[2022-12-10 16:09:45] <casualguy_57> @glowblow_ mro
[2022-12-10 16:09:53] <+Pughy30> Crazy how blues can be that hard to pack, some of them are like discard
[2022-12-10 16:09:54] <%ItsTr3ple> I reckon we get 78+ PP's on Monday
[2022-12-10 16:09:54] <%+Golderlight123> @NepentheZ  yoyu didn't read my comment about the walkout - you can also get a walkout on the right side - you just have to wait that little longer and there will be a  star near the rating isnde that area
[2022-12-10 16:09:55] <%FUTDAN26> Back to back Henderson‚Äôs üòÇüòÇ
[2022-12-10 16:09:56] <casualguy_57> Morocco is tough to break down

[2022-12-10 16:10:31] <%+Guiri1WHU> @jancey07 sorry but poch is washed just dwells on his past "merits and all he does is cry about hed do a better job than other managers

[2022-12-10 16:49:08] <Mxtsoe> wheres var?
[2022-12-10 16:49:10] <%+amatthew87> Refs are too scared to book players for diving
[2022-12-10 16:49:12] <BigEagz> its so silly when Goliath vs David and Goliath starts to act and beg for fouls lmfao
[2022-12-10 16:49:16] <+htsolna08> portugal need Le√£o

[2022-12-10 16:49:35] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> I back United players to the hilt. But I really really dislike Bruno. I can‚Äôt imagine what rival fans must think
[2022-12-10 16:49:35] <%AHumanAlien> Portugal players surrounding the ref, embarrassing themselves
[2022-12-10 16:49:37] <uncommittedgamer> @bigeagz lol what

[2022-12-10 16:49:48] <+kierantodd08> Nice hair cu my nep
[2022-12-10 16:49:49] <+blackm456> I feel like players got booked for diving all the time but nowadays it never happens anymore

[2022-12-10 16:49:54] <+hutch_ie> People got too hyped too early on Gancalo Ramos. Barely got a look in today
[2022-12-10 16:49:59] <+ShelliX7> is there a flash challange?

[2022-12-10 16:50:32] <+FUTJDH> Bruno is the definition of a ratty player
[2022-12-10 16:50:36] <flashviking> Let the lad have his soup. That‚Äôs some good good soup
[2022-12-10 16:50:36] <BigEagz> @uncommittedgamer what i mean, portugal morocco is like david v goliath, as if portugal is massive favorite, and all they did in 1st half was cry and beg for foulds
[2022-12-10 16:50:41] <%tja_100> @coys51 Fair enough lolü§£
[2022-12-10 16:50:43] <%ItsTr3ple> @SpreadsheetFifa I think it's the same for Guendouzi, except I love him to death LUL
[2022-12-10 16:50:48] <+craigalexei> Packed Kounde tradable, anyone use him? is he worth the money or sell?
[2022-12-10 16:50:48] <+Yianni33> Remember the SUD/LIB grind. What a time
[2022-12-10 16:50:57] <%+SamSurg3> boufal is actually  gonna be insane with 5* wf
[2022-12-10 16:51:02] <%AHumanAlien> @Yianni33 those were the days
[2022-12-10 16:51:07] <%+SamSurg3> only around 80k now
[2022-12-10 16:51:14] <uncommittedgamer> @bigeagz so them attacking and that happening there should not be a discussion at all? Because they are Goliath. Got it
[2022-12-10 16:51:22] <tounsihaithem> if portugal player continue to cry about everything the will lose
[2022-12-10 16:51:25] <joemarley13> @craigalexei how much is he?
[2022-12-10 16:51:28] <%+Guiri1WHU> @Yianni33 still sing the jingle every now and then

[2022-12-10 16:52:15] <ObeseMan20> Boufal went up 20k just after the goal
[2022-12-10 16:52:23] <$OzStorm> it's halftime
[2022-12-10 16:52:27] <%+OhSxnch> @hutch_ie no
[2022-12-10 16:52:28] <flashviking> Just seen an awful Hyundai advert with Stevie G doing the voiceover work. Rubbush
[2022-12-10 16:52:29] <%tja_100> They butchered this classic
[2022-12-10 16:52:35] <joemarley13> @craigalexei I'd sell, things don't hold much value and I'd take 300k where you can
[2022-12-10 16:52:39] <GlasgowFIFA> Hakimi went up 10k after the goal weird for a non live card
[2022-12-10 16:52:46] <agdaltarek99> whats actually happening we are leading against portugal in a quarter final BibleThump BibleThump
[2022-12-10 16:52:47] <ncantuna> Aa9 skillz is prob dying
[2022-12-10 16:53:01] <+craigalexei> TOTY's will be so rare this year with no one able to grind packs
[2022-12-10 16:53:01] <%$Jamesnewton8> remember to check out Acuna Nep
[2022-12-10 16:53:06] <%tommnstq> Yo nep how‚Äôs weekend league going
[2022-12-10 16:53:13] <vinigem> Do you expect any changes in Eng playing XI vs France?
[2022-12-10 16:53:15] <+craigalexei> @joemarley13 true true man
[2022-12-10 16:53:18] <+crazecricket> u think boufal goes up more if Morocco hold on
[2022-12-10 16:53:25] <Messagge> @ncantuna aa said last night he was expecting Portugal to lose
[2022-12-10 16:53:27] <flashviking> @glasgowfifa not really. I made bank off Lautaro Phenom cards last night when Argentina won. People go crazy
[2022-12-10 16:53:28] <+hutch_ie> @craigalexei they were a lot easier to pack last year though which tells me it should be okay
[2022-12-10 16:53:31] <romellonaidoo> apparently portugal play better without cr7
[2022-12-10 16:53:36] <%+Guiri1WHU> @hutch_ie no but you turn down the volume of the stream to the point where you barely hear the music and still hear nep
[2022-12-10 16:53:39] <%+mikekozy23> @crazecricket wdym "you think", thats how the cards work
[2022-12-10 16:53:39] <iDersch> still a decent card at 86
[2022-12-10 16:53:46] <eltorrooow> cheeky kaylor navas put him in the shaw sbc
[2022-12-10 16:53:46] <the_dude3000> shadow makes him a 93 CB
[2022-12-10 16:53:49] <+plebalertx> would be a decent CB
[2022-12-10 16:53:54] <jester23y> Is it coming home lads?
[2022-12-10 16:54:03] <flashviking> Soup‚Ä¶.Really nice üòä
[2022-12-10 16:54:03] <+craigalexei> @hutch_ie yea good point, I hope so, everything seems harder to pack this year

[2022-12-10 16:55:38] <%+mikekozy23> i think it'll take a while for him to drop another 40k
[2022-12-10 16:55:39] <K7NGDOM> 100% 100k is easy to make back
[2022-12-10 16:55:39] <baldnose> I think you can get a better player nep
[2022-12-10 16:55:45] <%+609blazers> he will also go down if there is an upgrade pack this week he will get packed in upgrades
[2022-12-10 16:55:45] <%$Apple22> if they do a party bag sbc or something he;ll come down more

[2022-12-10 17:17:44] <%+rockmanl0l> Brighton were linked with him for january window, sounds like our kind of striker if he misses loads
[2022-12-10 17:17:44] <kman3164> It‚Äôs a shame that EA haven‚Äôt done any man of the match cards, they‚Äôve missed such an opportunity
[2022-12-10 17:17:56] <+ElCazando> Do you have any millwall players @NepentheZ

[2022-12-10 17:21:17] <+xxMillhouse> I like the new chem system better than the old, but need to add more positions for players, new formations with different position combos, and buff icons & managers
[2022-12-10 17:21:34] <%+mikekozy23> oiii bruno close
[2022-12-10 17:21:48] <droxy3x> penaldo ghosting again unlucky

[2022-12-10 17:21:52] <%+theoldmanrtg7619> I think it refreshing we have a underdog story at the World Cup
[2022-12-10 17:22:38] <%Krossnes> I think the captain should give chem to players, that could've been something they could do.
[2022-12-10 17:22:38] <%+mikekozy23> @droxy3x LUL
[2022-12-10 17:22:39] <%sorarejosh> we need ET , bruno will rack up good pts in 120mins

[2022-12-10 17:22:41] <+Axim404> if it goes to pens moroccos chances are higher, bono is a beast

[2022-12-10 17:22:44] <%+mikekozy23> @Rileyable so they're due to win one you're saying?

[2022-12-10 17:23:08] <%+theoldmanrtg7619> Quite a nice pairing
[2022-12-10 17:23:08] <%+stackmillz> that acuna card looks sick
[2022-12-10 17:23:15] <kailinr2> oh wait he just gave the armband to cr7
[2022-12-10 17:23:31] <%Krossnes> Future Stars Kubo was quite good
[2022-12-10 17:23:31] <%+609blazers> Nep did you ever try the Ben White world cup card? Hes been setting in my club and I may try him this weekend since I am also using Saka

[2022-12-10 17:23:58] <Boony1997> Is lengthy still meta/essential for strikers ?
[2022-12-10 17:24:07] <Maverick_T2> basic don't look bad tho
[2022-12-10 17:24:10] <%$hazzat1345> @boony1997 No
[2022-12-10 17:24:17] <iDersch> @Boony1997 its not bad, but defo not essential
[2022-12-10 17:24:50] <Maverick_T2> waiting for your assessment on Shaw before grabbing him üëäüèø
[2022-12-10 17:24:52] <Boony1997> Thanks, using WC Hernandez and base best but find they are both getting bodied

[2022-12-10 17:25:12] <%+theoldmanrtg7619> Saka shhoting is easy way better than that card suggests in real life
[2022-12-10 17:25:12] <%+stackmillz> does acuna have lb capabilities
[2022-12-10 17:25:40] <%$coys51> I so hope Morocco can hold on

[2022-12-10 17:25:54] <+fifa_quant> Nice team there Nep! Have you tried or heard anything good about WC Schweini?
[2022-12-10 17:25:55] <%Krossnes> Capdevilla best LB in the game imo. I tried Moments Carlos but his WF is scary sometimes.
[2022-12-10 17:25:59] <+xhannnes> My okocha and 3 boufals just disappeared HELP

[2022-12-10 17:26:32] <+tylerdgray15> Do you think it‚Äôs worth me putting in 87 socrates into luke shaw as I don‚Äôt use him?

[2022-12-10 18:56:40] <%+amatthew87> Definitely stream snipers
[2022-12-10 18:56:40] <%+ShortySan1986> I'd maybe take some time out nep, best not play triggered. That way the game is winning and not even your opponent
[2022-12-10 18:56:43] <%+kingnovakin> this is old gen @Hero_CHW
[2022-12-10 18:56:43] <%theJFKexperience0> I‚Äôm just gonna get vieira m8 not worth the risk I played like 10 hrs to get all those tokens
[2022-12-10 18:56:49] <%$SmallBearSports> Theres nothing worse than starting a champs run facing absolute demons back to back
[2022-12-10 18:56:51] <%+pierce_23> do we think theres maybe fewer playing WL atm? im not because not a fan of the changes to rewards and would rather grind vieira?
[2022-12-10 18:57:25] <@%+Owen_Slater> I dont get the thought process behind stream sniping at all
[2022-12-10 18:57:42] <%Dezalleycat> I honestly thought I was playing the AI earlier today in one game
[2022-12-10 18:57:46] <%tomw99_> @Owen_Slater feel important for 5 mins i guess
[2022-12-10 18:57:47] <%+SamSurg3> I dunno but i feel like not having DMs is actully openinig up ur midfield hard
[2022-12-10 18:57:48] <%+609blazers> imagine stream sniping, feel like it takes a sad lonely person to do that that just wants attention.
[2022-12-10 18:57:54] <%+thedispraxicchef1985> Don‚Äôt know why people have nasty to you when I think you are one of the best streamers on twitch love your fifa content keep up the amazing content also love your rtg videos they are top tear
[2022-12-10 18:57:56] <%+Quilva> Same @Owen_Slater its just poor
[2022-12-10 18:58:01] <%+Politik27> nontent or content today then peeps?
[2022-12-10 18:58:06] <%+stackmillz> what advantage do u get when u stream snipe curious
[2022-12-10 18:58:06] <@%+Owen_Slater> @tomw99_ To who though, its no more than any other player who randomly plays Nep.
[2022-12-10 18:58:08] <%+Dr__Dean> This latest patch is made gameplay unplayable.
[2022-12-10 18:58:19] <%+gpnick7> I've had to drop my line in custom tactics literature had about 6 games that where like 12 goals plus have no idea what's happend to defenders
[2022-12-10 18:58:31] <%+ShortySan1986> There's plenty sad and pathetic people who play fifa solely to stream snipe and ruins peoples days. It's laughable
[2022-12-10 18:58:39] <%Dezalleycat> They will be sat in a call group/discord chat ,getting off on each other
[2022-12-10 18:58:40] <+Gworv> sub only mode? what did u pricks do this time?
[2022-12-10 18:58:45] <%+SamSurg3> u know every football coach's advice is dont pick CBs in def
[2022-12-10 18:58:50] <%+609blazers> even if he's getting an ego trip, he still looks like a crumb, stream sniping shows you are a sad and lonely person.
[2022-12-10 18:58:55] <%jjaden10> Did they patch corners in the last few day, I‚Äôve gone from scoring like 70-80% to barely winning a header
[2022-12-10 18:58:56] <%+kingnovakin> 2 mins to 6 neppo
[2022-12-10 18:59:02] <@%Viperlization> yeah he was proper sweaty

[2022-12-10 18:59:05] <%+stackmillz> have u checked gameplay on new gen
[2022-12-10 18:59:06] <%+SamSurg3> that's why i feel that haveing DMs is mandatory to def
[2022-12-10 18:59:07] <@%Viperlization> some silly left sticking
[2022-12-10 18:59:09] <$LukaLockup> Casuals have moved on from fifa at this point.

[2022-12-10 18:59:47] <%CrazyEskimoPenguin> His backline is something else, where have all the casual squads gone this year?
[2022-12-10 18:59:57] <%notgravityeu> FIFA needs good streamer mode to block these clowns just trying to be annoying

[2022-12-10 19:00:10] <%BrackenWBA10> The first 5 games are always the hardest this year
[2022-12-10 19:00:14] <%+Niqfar> should i keep or sell griezman PTG?
[2022-12-10 19:00:15] <$LukaLockup> @owen_slater those casuals that make up the majority aren‚Äôt playing fut champions. They are playing kick off
[2022-12-10 19:00:19] <%+Drogo2015> most the casuals have stopped playing now out of my 6 friends 2 of us are left and we are better players

[2022-12-10 19:00:50] <%+ockyflocka> we need fifa 23 to come out for free so there's more casuals playing ut
[2022-12-10 19:00:51] <@%+Owen_Slater> @LukaLockup That isnt true, there is enough casuals to still give a huge portion through champs, or at least casuals relative to Nep

[2022-12-10 19:06:21] <@%+Owen_Slater> They used to have tokens with challenge SBCs which were like 6-7k with a good pack. Another way they extorting the community

[2022-12-10 19:07:30] <@%+Owen_Slater> @Owen_Slater Silver Stars >>> Playing 8 games of SB with 6 players from x nation
[2022-12-10 19:07:45] <%+609blazers> @Owen_Slater yeah but those were kinda shit tbf because if you were off the game for a couple days you'd miss a token. at least the way it is now most of the tokens are there for a couple weeks
[2022-12-10 19:07:51] <%+mikekozy23> @Owen_Slater do it in rivals then innit, i did all mine in d3
[2022-12-10 19:07:57] <%+67jezza> looks like Giroud with better dribbling

[2022-12-10 19:11:35] <%jjaden10> Packed Baby Stoichkov and he‚Äôs actually pretty decent
[2022-12-10 19:11:41] <%+Politik27> You watching the match on stream or getting off nep?
[2022-12-10 19:11:50] <%jjaden10> Links are the biggest problem tho

[2022-12-10 19:12:13] <%notgravityeu> stoichkov or keep base vjr?
[2022-12-10 19:12:30] <@%+Owen_Slater> They used to have tokens with challenge SBCs which were like 6-7k with a good pack. Another way they extorting the community

[2022-12-10 19:14:30] <%jjaden10> Idk if stoichkov is worth it, in my 2 weeks don‚Äôt u think there‚Äôs better cards and that much for an sbc always pains me
