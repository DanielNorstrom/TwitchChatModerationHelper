[2023-01-06 01:57:29] <%Faithlesssoul> @gamepeeking if you're talking about this camera that gets glitchy that's because the grass in the game messes with the encoder too many objects at one time but other than that I don't know

[2023-01-06 22:06:45] <xGranham> @OlBoyGoose usually the fishbowl sound on virtual surround was caused by the headphones not having enough power. After I started using a dac/amp and turned it way up it sounded fine. You could try another surround thing that's not DTS maybe it works better for you, maybe windows audio
