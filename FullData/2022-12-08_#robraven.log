(1) Save up your channel points or (2) Make clips of your favorite moments of the stream. The more you clip the higher your chance of making VIP for being a valued member and helping out Rob with clips for highlight videos.

[2022-12-08 14:20:03] <captain_reign> to obtain the ghost curse. you will need to be level 100 in the guardian faction whilst being pirate Legend
[2022-12-08 14:20:29] <%+xdaggersx3307> ohhh ok well I'm a legend so now I just got to try and reach 100

[2022-12-08 14:21:00] <captain_reign> to gain the skeleton curse you will need to be level 75 in the reapers Bones and level 100 in servant faction.

[2022-12-08 14:55:25] <+lutherharkon25> he cannons from there
[2022-12-08 14:55:30] <%scr3am1ngsku11s> lol what kind of shot was that
[2022-12-08 14:55:34] <+nedboulter> sometimes I accidentally get far away from the enemy while repairing
[2022-12-08 14:55:46] <%JoshuaHobe> @SyntheticDev you get lag when people have many trinkets

[2022-12-08 14:57:09] <+ItsMeDaniel_LIVE> When did your hair turn grey? Or did you usually dye it?
[2022-12-08 14:57:16] <%scr3am1ngsku11s> hope his boat sails off the circle
[2022-12-08 14:57:20] <1MahdaWi> so what is the most important thing to do after i return back after i died
[2022-12-08 14:57:28] <tazzythederg> how you gonna run with DA sails on?
[2022-12-08 14:57:54] VIEWERS: 485

[2022-12-08 14:58:11] <%JoshuaHobe> @stealthdeagle So a tier 1 is the smallest hole, tier 2 is a medium hole and tier 3 is the biggest hole. They all go up with repairing time as well
[2022-12-08 14:58:16] <tazzythederg> like, you gotta have enough hours to get those sails, surely he did a tiny bit of pvp during all that time?
[2022-12-08 14:58:18] <%Jaeknir> well the DA sails give him the tactical advantage of seeing where he's fleeing to

(1) Save up your channel points or (2) Make clips of your favorite moments of the stream. The more you clip the higher your chance of making VIP for being a valued member and helping out Rob with clips for highlight videos.

[2022-12-08 15:54:46] <%$sniperp_99> Also maneuverability, anchor up fixed wheel, is sometimes more important than forward movement. So sometimes just spinning and shooting will be better than taking the time and fixing the mast

[2022-12-08 16:10:39] <stealthdeagle> then u can get on ships easier without the mermaid showing up

[2022-12-08 16:10:57] <%Danbob_Airsoft> It's not even a difficult concept to program. When >x range from ship, spawn mermaid at y range to player and move it when out of z range of mermaid

[2022-12-08 16:43:12] <@%+vampirevixen90> Rob stop messing with it. I know its hard not to, but messing with it could make it worse
[2022-12-08 16:43:16] <%EmmaBDoodlen> Your health is more importent
[2022-12-08 16:43:17] <%Idriguesk> call it and call the doctor
[2022-12-08 16:43:23] <%JoshuaHobe> paracetamol maybe helps?
[2022-12-08 16:43:24] <RoseStarBunny> Best to go see a doctor. It could be a gland though?
[2022-12-08 16:43:29] <%$TallDarkandBlueeyed> HOney and Ginger
[2022-12-08 16:43:32] <Ryan____2003> that doesn't sound good
[2022-12-08 16:43:54] <%JoshuaHobe> a little bit
[2022-12-08 16:44:03] <+chaserthesewerqueen> Messing with it won't be helping
[2022-12-08 16:44:13] <@%+September_Rose> stop messing with it
[2022-12-08 16:44:13] <%+Patch2707> I get soreness with mine but deffo worth a trip to doctors rob
[2022-12-08 16:44:14] <%harleyqueen19720> see if you can get an emergency appointment if it's getting worse
[2022-12-08 16:44:15] <%Idriguesk> yea, I'd say it's time to go to the doctor and get it checked out before it gets worse

[2022-12-08 16:44:17] <@^StreamElements> Guys I'm also on YouTube! Subscribe to my channel here ---> https://www.youtube.com/robraven
[2022-12-08 16:44:20] <%JoshuaHobe> stop touching it please, it can cause irritation maybe
[2022-12-08 16:44:23] <RoseStarBunny> Some ibuprofen might help fight the pain, but I'd go see a doctor.
[2022-12-08 16:44:24] <%VoodooVR> could be an inflamation, i have something similar
[2022-12-08 16:44:24] <weal0w> prolly an infection man
[2022-12-08 16:44:46] <@%+Hyplivion> definitely need to get it looked at
[2022-12-08 16:44:48] <%+Patch2707> you had a cold recently ?
[2022-12-08 16:44:58] <@%+vampirevixen90> Rob, its best you get to the dr to get looked at.
[2022-12-08 16:45:06] <+nedboulter> just chill out with the singing and stuff for a bit
[2022-12-08 16:45:07] <Ryan____2003> probably pulled it yeah
[2022-12-08 16:45:10] <%JoshuaHobe> yee maybe stop a few weeks with impressions matey
[2022-12-08 16:45:16] <freezing_star> Had something similar a couple of weeks ago. Think it was a swollen gland. NHS advise is take paracetamol/ibuprofen and it will be gone in a couple of weeks.
[2022-12-08 16:45:23] <pjuke> you could go see an ENT, they will tell immediately, probably just temporary :)
