[2022-12-24 20:46:48] <%sheephead__> IMO Imagine Dragons can make 1 style of song, and they keep milking that for what it's worth
[2022-12-24 20:47:07] <Astrid_185> If I remember correctly while Riot is a company they do have different apartments for different things (like Arcane has their own team for that and League has their own teams as well)

[2022-12-24 20:48:16] <!%TheSwatKnight> the songs have more variety yeah but it's quite consistent
