[2022-12-28 12:51:51] <%+drealselix> @astonmkc she doesn‚Äôt want to travel too far I guess
[2022-12-28 12:51:57] <!%Simonrpfan> @Astonmkc yes but she is a tourist here and its far for her with no transport.
[2022-12-28 12:52:10] <%+Astonmkc> @drealselix Fair enough

[2022-12-28 12:52:51] <%+Astonmkc> honestly, I wouldn't mind calling a grab for her to go to Bedok 85 or Old Airport road. Since she's a tourist, she should eat our better food :P
