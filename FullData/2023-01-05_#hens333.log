[2023-01-05 14:43:11] <Cheeper97> so how does this addon extactly work? Does she have to use both standard blinks to get back to her original position? Or is it possible to do that right after the first one?
[2023-01-05 14:43:35] <phishstix01> What if it just puts you into fatigue but you recharge your blinks
[2023-01-05 14:43:40] <aaz1z> nurse now can blink 10 times and they say she got nerfed

[2023-01-05 14:54:45] <DoubleEngravings> theyre still intending on removing hug tech eventually, thus nurse will still be the only killer in the game who can use her power to negate every loop/resource so shes still the strongest imo

[2023-01-05 15:10:07] <%ItsJustHal> twitch is hemorrhaging money   I'm not surprised amazon is slapping ads everywhere
[2023-01-05 15:10:08] <+Humanerror_goldfish> had 6 i a diffrent stream  so 7 sound that nuts to me
[2023-01-05 15:10:09] <5_StarDiego> hello hens downloaded twitch just to watch you since i binged all your youtube vids

[2023-01-05 15:10:19] <Southrobin> number of ads depends on the country you're in imo

[2023-01-05 15:10:31] <Droidzqt> if you enter a stream and during the preroll the streamer plays more adds I believe they stack together so you could get 7 xD

[2023-01-05 15:12:13] <%GENJ1SMOM> It is always around december. twitch gets more and better ad offers
[2023-01-05 15:12:19] <%+Kunklission> @Chase_Roo_ twitch turbo is 8$ usd a month, no ads and i believe streamer still gets ad revenue
[2023-01-05 15:12:22] <Cheeper97> does quick and quiet affect this?

[2023-01-05 15:13:51] <xpeachflavorx_> is it just me or do all knights camp and tunnel lol
[2023-01-05 15:13:51] <JulianCalabasas> imo they needed to massively buff patrolling and massively nerf instaspawning guards to make him not atrocious but I guess they'll do that 8 years from now maybe

[2023-01-05 15:14:28] <xpeachflavorx_> everytime i have a knight match they just camp and tunnel at either 5 or 4 gens lol

[2023-01-05 15:14:34] <Cheeper97> nothing about knight is fun imo
[2023-01-05 15:14:41] <pogs_geller> @xpeachflavorx_ well i guess the killer isn't that great and (correct me if im wrong) he can place guards near hooks
[2023-01-05 15:14:57] <+Propret> I think it's a terrible killer from start to finish. I really hope he'll be completely redesigned sometime in the future
[2023-01-05 15:14:57] <+Slyvaina> Same can be said for bubba or nurse or anyone because any player can decide to camp and tunnel
[2023-01-05 15:14:58] <Danneren_> Meg doing totems KEKW
[2023-01-05 15:14:59] <damodadrugo> @damodadrugo i know, but it's cool that you can see who is and isn't doing anything. best thing about this ptb so far

[2023-01-05 15:20:36] <dz0nnyy> there is a slight bigger lunge on 2nd blink right?
[2023-01-05 15:20:39] <vacivuss> windows is like the survivor shadowborn. It's too addicting to take off.
[2023-01-05 15:20:40] <+im_thinking0> is it fairer?
[2023-01-05 15:20:42] <SarahlMS> @babtmootan I'm addict to windows, when I play without it I feel a little bit lost sometimes, wich doens't happens when I'm with it

[2023-01-05 15:20:56] <xpeachflavorx_> longer lunge add on plus coup de grace lol

[2023-01-05 15:21:03] <%+RunaBlueRuna> is there always a dead zone behind main building on the new eyrie?

[2023-01-05 15:21:49] <%$babtmootan> @sarahlms I'd deffo recommend getting used to playing without it as it's a valuable perk slot for something else like antitunnel etc, i get the addiction though, you can basically have windows if you just try and scout your area before starting on a gen!!

[2023-01-05 15:24:24] <%jorom3> @thedemondoctor they changes the perk a little bit
[2023-01-05 15:24:26] <%GENJ1SMOM> @babtmootan If you play solo stick with windows
[2023-01-05 15:24:36] <%babyjuice20> @TheDemonDoctor nothing but who uses buckle up anyway

[2023-01-05 15:24:55] <ColossalDonut5> @babtmootan it basically gives me an excuse to not learn any of the maps which I kind of struggle with and I don't usually run any perks otherwise honestly but yeah I do need to curb my addiction sometime

[2023-01-05 15:26:07] <%$babtmootan> @colossaldonut5 i get that 100%, it honestly doesn't take too long just gotta learn main for each map and every loop is basically the same on most maps, you can do it!!!

[2023-01-05 15:26:11] <AllDangerous> That was too slick haha
[2023-01-05 15:26:20] <ColossalDonut5> the fact it shows recovery makes buckle up useless KEKW

[2023-01-05 15:26:44] <hugsandstabbies> they changed buckle up anyways
[2023-01-05 15:27:01] <%GENJ1SMOM> @babtmootan It helps you so much. You would waste so much time checking jungely gyms.... I know where pallets spawn but finding filler pallets behinds rocks can be so good. It also gives you information where your mates are looping

[2023-01-05 15:38:43] <ColossalDonut5> @babtmootan no I mean what are they gonna do for next patch when we get it at basekit basically? now we're gonna be able to see dying progress which was the main point of the perk.
[2023-01-05 15:39:01] <+wonderfulturtle> I love ruin on nemi
[2023-01-05 15:39:19] <%$babtmootan> @colossaldonut5 that's what they've done with it! so it has some synergy with a wglf ftp build

[2023-01-05 15:40:04] <ColossalDonut5> @babtmootan oh did they actually buff it? I didn't see it in the patch notes, I was just memeing since we're getting the main part of it at base now.
[2023-01-05 15:40:08] <+CarissMcbober> If the guards would aggro through the floor knight would be good here...
[2023-01-05 15:40:28] <%the_oracle_> @CarissMcbober they can coconuts did a video on it
[2023-01-05 15:40:29] <%$babtmootan> @colossaldonut5 yeah they changed it but for some reason said nothing in the patch notes, classic bhvr KEKW

[2023-01-05 15:41:00] <%jorom3> should have tried
[2023-01-05 15:41:00] <+CarissMcbober> @the_oracle_ Oh, they still can? I thought they fixed that. I tried to do it and it didn't work for me anymore. Maybe I just did it wrong.
[2023-01-05 15:41:06] <+crazy_microwave> do the guards go through the pallets?
[2023-01-05 15:41:14] <+Sinott> the fat guard is the one that chases you the most right?
[2023-01-05 15:41:16] <%+xploitr13> Yes same Knight
[2023-01-05 15:41:31] <+matteriess> Knight seems in a good place (in all honesty)

[2023-01-05 15:42:12] <ColossalDonut5> @babtmootan oh neat, so they give you a speed boost now. that's cool. still kinda useless but it's something.
[2023-01-05 15:42:18] <%the_oracle_> @CarissMcbober they have to miss a skillcheck in the range for it to work but yeah it should still be possible
[2023-01-05 15:42:19] <+matteriess> @matteriess Oh i totally agree with that
[2023-01-05 15:42:51] <ColossalDonut5> it's like kidnapping Victor against Twins
[2023-01-05 15:42:55] <+Mate8_> GULP!

[2023-01-05 15:43:01] <+CarissMcbober> @the_oracle_ Oh, huh. That's super specific. Okay. I guess you need overcharge or merciless storm or something?

[2023-01-05 15:43:39] <%GENJ1SMOM> @matteriess so he is not in a good place. He is in a really bad place. I would prefer a change on the knight instead of twins

[2023-01-05 15:44:43] <%+xploitr13> It's only useless because he occupied you with the guard AND chased you. It's only slowdown if he's not chasing you as well. I think too many Knights dont understand this.

[2023-01-05 15:45:09] <+matteriess> @GENJ1SMOM He does need a total rework in terms of his power, but i honestly don't think BHVR would do that. At least not for another year, or so :( I think with my first comment, i just mean there's now more options of how to play him
[2023-01-05 15:45:12] <ddestructor_> The pallet getsblocks at the moment the guard received an order
[2023-01-05 15:45:12] <ColossalDonut5> oh shit that dude really did just spawn from nowhere
[2023-01-05 15:45:16] <Sdative> yeah i think the ai overrides i

[2023-01-05 15:46:39] <ddestructor_> gwtting the flag does do gives haste anymore?
[2023-01-05 15:46:44] <ColossalDonut5> does the flag still give endurance?
[2023-01-05 15:46:46] <Fishpoint> you are not working on a gen so that means that his power works pretty well

[2023-01-05 16:11:33] <%+Dean_N64> btw how haste works is
[2023-01-05 16:11:36] <%+Dean_N64> When The Knight creates a Patrol Path longer than 10m, he will gain the Haste Status Effect. The Effect’s duration depends on the length of the Path, beginning at 2 seconds and increasing to 6 seconds at the maximum distance of 32m.
[2023-01-05 16:11:42] <+NekoShepherd> How long is his patrol path by default? Can maybe kind of learn by the power bar.
[2023-01-05 16:11:45] <%MegaFangKing> D:
[2023-01-05 16:11:46] <DrTonio> @genj1smom nothing to do with dpi, just the ingame mechanics of being able to turn faster on any killer when looking up or down and the fact that turn limitations are removed once the oni starts the lunge

[2023-01-05 16:17:03] <DrTonio> the "c" isn't silent in "coup de grace", otherwise you'd be saying "coup de gras" which in fact means "strike of fat" 😅
[2023-01-05 16:17:10] <NyquilEvangelist> this killer is worth it just for the SFX and visual design

[2023-01-05 16:32:26] <Sdative> her music is so ass
[2023-01-05 16:32:30] <%+magic_mat1> Its not as weak as I think BHVR believe it is LUL
[2023-01-05 16:32:50] <EmeraldTechno> who is the bot this game?
[2023-01-05 16:32:52] <+Logique_> i mean yeah this is easy as hell but i doubt it's better than basekit
[2023-01-05 16:33:00] <bianc0neri> Can she blink right after she teleport back to her original position? Or she had to wait fatigue?

[2023-01-05 16:33:14] <vBennyZ_> nurse buff o nerf?? 😱
[2023-01-05 16:33:25] <%+magic_mat1> You can just walk close and blink pretty much on them and there is not much you can do
[2023-01-05 16:33:37] <tayl7r> would you say nurse is still better than blight?
[2023-01-05 16:33:37] <+RezedentSleeper> it's an iri tho
[2023-01-05 16:33:39] <+Logique_> ez mode nurse LUL
[2023-01-05 16:33:47] <%+Dean_N64> @vbennyz_ I think neither but "reworked" ive been using
[2023-01-05 16:33:52] <%+magic_mat1> I already enjoyed Matchbox before the buff
[2023-01-05 16:33:57] <$NPCThree> finally I can do nurse daily
[2023-01-05 16:34:00] <%+magic_mat1> Its stronger than people think
[2023-01-05 16:34:03] <+Logique_> @RezedentSleeper yeah and so is iri tape, doesn't stop every sadako from bringing it
[2023-01-05 16:34:15] <%+Ellamin> At the end of the day it's still Nurse
[2023-01-05 16:34:22] <%+Itz_Yayeet2> This ptb has been pretty interesting so far
[2023-01-05 16:34:23] VIEWERS: 940
[2023-01-05 16:34:37] <%+magic_mat1> I do with 1 blink, since it is a quick recharge
[2023-01-05 16:34:41] <+Logique_> are you winning son?
[2023-01-05 16:34:51] <%jorom3> imagine Clueless
[2023-01-05 16:35:04] <%MegaFangKing> I feel like "the counterplay is very limited" has always and always will be Nurse in a nutshell.
[2023-01-05 16:35:12] <NyquilEvangelist> It's also maybe better for stealth builds since she doesn't rely on blink to patrol as heavily
[2023-01-05 16:35:17] <%GENJ1SMOM> walking smb down is always the easier and safer way

[2023-01-05 16:36:46] <dilfeatter> when theses changes will come to dbd?
[2023-01-05 16:37:02] <+Logique_> two weeks probably
[2023-01-05 16:37:06] <%+Dean_N64> Its kind of like playing billy, use it for distance or try your luck with a hit
[2023-01-05 16:37:09] <+JoeJoeLive> i've seen it all, see this streamer taunting me b/c he thought was awesome withis 4 syringe team.  his next match a a blight downs him first he logs out and complains he has 30 minute ban.
[2023-01-05 16:37:10] <NyquilEvangelist> Matchbox is definitely worse against DH

[2023-01-05 16:38:38] <erbufalo666> glad they brought 7 blinks nurse back
[2023-01-05 16:39:00] <%GENJ1SMOM> It is easier and safer but 2 blink is still better
[2023-01-05 16:39:00] <%+Itz_Yayeet2> what a flashbang
[2023-01-05 16:39:02] <%+magic_mat1> Not to sound like a dickhead but I send myself to Lery's with Matchbox and I have not lost a match in longer than I can remember
[2023-01-05 16:39:19] <%Ahzikor> bro this nurse is too fast xD
[2023-01-05 16:39:28] <Amata19> yeah she is speeeeeeding
[2023-01-05 16:39:33] <EmeraldTechno> i feel like these new addons are pretty goofy
[2023-01-05 16:39:42] <%+Dean_N64> I cant tell if games go on longer with nurse because people are testing, or if its because of the changes
[2023-01-05 16:39:51] <%+Dean_N64> i see end game much more in ptb

[2023-01-05 16:41:14] <r3all1febro> @autismemperor the problem is MMR is based on escapes etc and a SoloQ mate stealthing the whole time and escaping through hatch will go up on MMR

[2023-01-05 16:42:59] <autismemperor> most games i play its one mate with brain cells the other two hide and wait it out hate playing the game atm
[2023-01-05 16:42:59] <%ClussyHonks> nurse is more tolerable now @Hens333
[2023-01-05 16:43:01] <%ClussyHonks> imo
[2023-01-05 16:43:06] <%+magic_mat1> I think it is a start as she needed a nerf but I dont think it will nerf good players that much
[2023-01-05 16:43:06] <%crocing> i think nurse will still be the strongest killer but it’s a step in the right direction
[2023-01-05 16:43:08] <miva420> @Hens333 I am soon turning 18, any advice in life from the wise hens?
[2023-01-05 16:43:11] <%waltonbago> I’m glad recharge is gone
[2023-01-05 16:43:16] <%+Dean_N64> I like it but 7 blink gives you a better chance over starstruck
[2023-01-05 16:43:17] <shinybigscary> I think its too little of a nerf
[2023-01-05 16:43:18] <BurrowingParrot> its still nurse
[2023-01-05 16:43:21] <E1ghtysix> range and recharge are dead and that's a pretty big dopamine hit tbh
[2023-01-05 16:43:21] <%+magic_mat1> Its mainly going to affect players who rely on BS builds
[2023-01-05 16:43:21] [Notification] theywhisper subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 10 months! [hensBrows hensHug]
[2023-01-05 16:43:22] <%MegaFangKing> I'm still not looking forward to go against her.
[2023-01-05 16:43:26] <NyquilEvangelist> Nerfing her by limiting her perk interactions I think is the worst way to nerf her, but it's something
[2023-01-05 16:43:34] <shinybigscary> her basekit is the same and still the most powerful
[2023-01-05 16:43:56] <startcook1e> They can't dethrone Nurse without changing her power (i.e. travel speed)
[2023-01-05 16:44:02] <+lumiinoous> i think the point of this ptb to see if the new hud can make nurse more bearable
[2023-01-05 16:44:02] <wonster_chan> gday everyone
[2023-01-05 16:44:08] <wonster_chan> oh shit a ptb today?
[2023-01-05 16:44:09] <%sam_vilderness> she is still strong, but i wonder what will be her comp loadout
[2023-01-05 16:44:22] <%MegaFangKing> The change for Blink Attacks to be Special is great but still gonna hate matches with her.

[2023-01-05 16:53:14] <verykawaii0001> You should put on the perk Coup de Grace, there’s a glitch with the nurse on the ptb so you can have infinite bit lunge swings

[2023-01-05 16:58:54] <Lapp_the_Wizard> can the nurse not grab off gens anymore?
[2023-01-05 16:58:56] <+Kickin_Buttxxx> This is one of those specific PTB changes that really needs to be reworked lol
[2023-01-05 16:59:04] <railgun_whatever_> @Lapp_the_Wizard she can
[2023-01-05 16:59:19] <%sam_vilderness> the term is "double back"
[2023-01-05 16:59:28] <sendach> @NotDrunky Double back is a term in English, it means to go back in the direction you came from
[2023-01-05 16:59:33] <sendach> It doesn't mean you go back twice
[2023-01-05 16:59:35] <Lapp_the_Wizard> because you walk double the distance
[2023-01-05 16:59:43] <+lumiinoous> you need to do two times

[2023-01-05 16:59:56] <%sam_vilderness> now the "double double"  means u go back twice

[2023-01-05 17:00:46] <%+Kunklission> i do agree with the sentiment that when you blink back you should only get like 1 back or something
[2023-01-05 17:00:51] <NyquilEvangelist> Yeah this seems pretty oppressive. 3 blinks to dodge and you also can't dodge backwards
[2023-01-05 17:01:05] <%Tollerwolf> i would prefer recharge addons over that tbh
[2023-01-05 17:01:07] <miva420> @ddestructor_ isnt that 6 tho

[2023-01-05 17:06:43] <%itizAJ> @LeoDeck only when noed is revealed

[2023-01-05 17:07:17] <!%+FireLily3223> @SarahlMS No, devour reveals either way
[2023-01-05 17:07:19] <Cheeper97> have you tried the 4.4 addon?
[2023-01-05 17:07:23] <iwouldve> anyone think pinhead worth getting on controller
[2023-01-05 17:07:26] <+bradc7504> PWYF seemed to increase blinmk speed and lunge
[2023-01-05 17:07:36] <+lmmaheadout> why noed?
[2023-01-05 17:07:37] <%ClussyHonks> get pwyf with noed
[2023-01-05 17:07:44] <%Tollerwolf> is a bug though probably @bradc7504
[2023-01-05 17:07:47] <LeoDeck> he lacked critical information PepeLaugh
[2023-01-05 17:07:47] <miva420> @iwouldve yeah but use the addons where the turn rate increases for your chains
[2023-01-05 17:07:50] <NyquilEvangelist> @iwouldve 99% of the time, you're putting your chain portal directly on the survivor, so your input doesnt need to be precise. go wild
[2023-01-05 17:07:53] <SarahlMS> @FireLily3223 really? oh...
[2023-01-05 17:07:55] <haroune190> hey guys <3
[2023-01-05 17:07:56] <lovelymann> wait have you tried devor with nurse
[2023-01-05 17:08:02] <%+Dean_N64> If you were doing a challenge lower then green add ons is there anything good?
[2023-01-05 17:08:06] <BonesBlinks> 4.4 addon basically turns you into Huntress but you ARE the hatchet
[2023-01-05 17:08:11] <+bradc7504> you think for that? i get its bugged with the stacks not dropping
[2023-01-05 17:08:11] <Cheeper97> did you apply the changes?

[2023-01-05 17:08:24] <lovelymann> ohhh
[2023-01-05 17:08:31] <sarahjean128> do you think devour should reveal with special attacks?

[2023-01-05 17:08:39] <Trammix> whats your thought about the new nurse so far?
[2023-01-05 17:08:52] <Spookychiptune> it does? u cant hide devour anymore?
[2023-01-05 17:08:58] <sarahjean128> lilithomenDEVOURDOPE that is true
[2023-01-05 17:08:59] <%ClussyHonks> doesnt it?
[2023-01-05 17:09:12] <SarahlMS> I'm sure pleague can hide it
[2023-01-05 17:09:21] <Zenott> No super fair, also hilarious
[2023-01-05 17:09:26] <Trammix> @henriquegames07 it got removed
[2023-01-05 17:09:28] <lovelymann> yeah plague can hide devor
[2023-01-05 17:09:31] <railgun_whatever_> Well if they implement the finishing Mori system devour is dead anyway
[2023-01-05 17:09:31] <sarahjean128> no that would not be fair at all, but would be funny
[2023-01-05 17:09:34] <Zenott> Not* super fair
[2023-01-05 17:09:41] <%+Dean_N64> the fun part for me with devour is the panic after realizing
[2023-01-05 17:09:57] <henriquegames07> my friend uses it but i cant

[2023-01-05 17:10:13] <NyquilEvangelist> such a fun perk when it isn't instantly cleansed. i stg totem spawns got neglected on some of these new maps
[2023-01-05 17:10:16] <iwouldve> devour encourages fair and good gameplay
[2023-01-05 17:10:19] <Trammix> @henriquegames07 both of you play on ptb right now?

[2023-01-05 17:30:54] <DesertYoshi> I have the most simple change to make in order to make it less unfair. Make it have a 2 second delay before activating when a Survivor is downed.

[2023-01-05 17:31:26] <NotDrunky> Reducing incap time to 10 sec would be ez to change
[2023-01-05 17:31:39] <DesertYoshi> That way you can still get the incapacitated if you aren't paying attention, but if you are, you can dodge it
[2023-01-05 17:31:39] <wonster_chan> @DesertYoshi then I think it would become useless, would hit first time, then never again (not that I'm against it tho)

[2023-01-05 17:35:49] <DesertYoshi> How would you change Jenner's Last Breath for live release? @Hens333
[2023-01-05 17:35:54] <zyphon01> @VT_Doggo yes the buffs are quite good, very fair now BLANKIES
[2023-01-05 17:35:58] <+vicentec17> bruh nurse got THIS as a "nerf" and billy got overheat as a "balanced killer" ResidentSleeper

[2023-01-05 17:36:45] <RainbOHwen> what if she just automatically went into fatigue after returning? or its that then just a useless addon?
[2023-01-05 17:36:46] <Gonzalo23__> overheat ResidentSleeper
[2023-01-05 17:36:47] <AgeTg> Checked the whole loop and still had 2 blinks for her KEKW

[2023-01-05 17:36:57] <%jorom3> ggs
[2023-01-05 17:37:00] <%Tollerwolf> @wonster_chan  Probably yeah. "We feel like the twins are high mmr monsters and are overperforming, therefore we decided the twins shouldn't be able to move anymore. To compensate for that, we decided to nerf the pig and give her the reversed bear trap after the survivors empowered all 5 gens :)
[2023-01-05 17:37:06] <+lmmaheadout> I feel like getting charges back is too much
[2023-01-05 17:37:19] <IzanaghiOkami> @RainbOHwen it would be useless yes
[2023-01-05 17:37:20] <%mig_rattlehead> ElectricLotus hmmm we are wine and olive what mean D:
[2023-01-05 17:37:21] <+suIIyboy> @rainbohwen that was what it used to be
[2023-01-05 17:37:23] <RainbOHwen> same I thought it was just gonna be like spriits addon you just return and then are an m1 killer for a bit
[2023-01-05 17:37:26] <DesertYoshi> Both or all 3 charges
[2023-01-05 17:37:36] <%mig_rattlehead> oh I gotcha nvm Tess KEKW
[2023-01-05 17:37:39] <gusnic1> so same as spirit, nurse got a "nerf"
[2023-01-05 17:37:48] <+suIIyboy> I think it was so a 2nd blink option before as well
[2023-01-05 17:37:49] <%ElectricLotus> @mig_rattlehead I might come to lisbon this year! Yes that's what I mean I wish I was from south Europe KEKW

[2023-01-05 17:38:06] <solsikkebeskytteren24> What about nurse would only have 1 blink in basekit?
[2023-01-05 17:38:07] <+lmmaheadout> 3 blinks?
[2023-01-05 17:38:12] <+unknownhornet23> campbells with bookmark might be good
[2023-01-05 17:38:18] <%jorom3> i cant join via steam
[2023-01-05 17:38:20] <SonnySharp> might be bugged
[2023-01-05 17:38:22] <Lirroh> just put overheat on all killers = problems fixed
[2023-01-05 17:38:22] <Lapp_the_Wizard> These addons are so op they are probably gonna nerf pig again smh

[2023-01-05 17:39:15] <+DrTerrato> its in the patch notes lol
[2023-01-05 17:39:16] <ddestructor_> They fixed some bugs that are not in the patch notes
[2023-01-05 17:39:17] <maxinthelibrary> theyd apparently been bugged since release, and this change is a bugfix

[2023-01-05 17:39:39] <+bradc7504> i think the switch between charolt and victor is cleaner AND there are bugs
[2023-01-05 17:39:44] <$greyglacier> kinda sad that they have been bugged since release KEKW
[2023-01-05 17:39:44] <ddestructor_> You can now switch to viktor with no delays, so looks much better
[2023-01-05 17:39:50] <+vicentec17> what's the command for patch notes
[2023-01-05 17:39:54] <DesertYoshi> From the event?

[2023-01-05 17:40:49] <+jarnoderechte> update finally finished
[2023-01-05 17:40:50] <%Tollerwolf> I would love a bug fix so I dont see survivors cough anymore, when they are not infected OR they just become infected when they cough. I dont care which way
[2023-01-05 17:40:53] <%Tollerwolf> it feels bad
[2023-01-05 17:40:55] <LastWayTTV> I finally don't get infected anymore from the rifts
[2023-01-05 17:41:05] <%Tollerwolf> if the screen shows it and it doesnt work
[2023-01-05 17:41:20] <MsP1nhead> @imkloon nooo ;-;
[2023-01-05 17:41:41] <DesertYoshi> But Hens, I believe that the Blindness addon is not as bad as you think. It refreshes every single time she hits, misses or fatigues in any way. Sure Blindness isn't the best status effect, but you will most likely be Blind the entire match.
[2023-01-05 17:41:52] <%ClussyHonks> i can sit out for now
[2023-01-05 17:41:58] <%Tollerwolf> dont you overblink too much with that? Or is that a skill thing?
[2023-01-05 17:42:05] <DesertYoshi> The old purple range
[2023-01-05 17:42:25] <Heru_Ra_Ha> you cant see auras afaik
[2023-01-05 17:42:27] <BennyDreadfool> Blindness counters windows, though I guess it doesn't really matter with nurse
[2023-01-05 17:42:28] <DesertYoshi> You fatigue when you hit
[2023-01-05 17:42:34] <+suIIyboy> fatigue within 8m is hot garbage
[2023-01-05 17:42:41] <DesertYoshi> Yes Otz tested it, it happens when you hit

[2023-01-05 17:42:45] <mii_dze> yee
[2023-01-05 17:42:46] <%+Commander_Ray> yes it happens when you hit or miss
[2023-01-05 17:42:48] <SarahlMS> if you hit then you fatige instantly, so yeah, it procs
[2023-01-05 17:42:56] <+bradc7504> Does blindness effect the HUD?
[2023-01-05 17:42:59] <NotDrunky> It works when you hit em too
[2023-01-05 17:43:20] <Lapp_the_Wizard> its not too bad on soloq where perks like windows are common
[2023-01-05 17:43:24] <AlexMenace> regarding the blindness condition: why do people use mindbreaker anyways? do i miss something here?
[2023-01-05 17:43:25] <SarahlMS> its good for slug
[2023-01-05 17:43:33] <Heru_Ra_Ha> maybe it is a slugging addon ya know those 5gens and all people slugged on the ground games
[2023-01-05 17:43:34] <NotDrunky> It would counter woo
[2023-01-05 17:43:34] <%helllcate_> yeah you still have the hud icons
[2023-01-05 17:43:36] <SonnySharp> we still see hud with fearmonger
[2023-01-05 17:43:36] <!%+FireLily3223> imo, you SHOULD still see the HUD if blinded. swfs can still communicate when blinded.
[2023-01-05 17:43:41] <TheArkthurus> Blinded, HUD no. If you get Blindness effect yo dont see auras but can see UI
[2023-01-05 17:43:41] <DesertYoshi> I think the main downside is hiding Kindred and Windows of Opportunity
[2023-01-05 17:43:41] <elias09368> the issue is that blindness doesn´t really affect you if you´re being chased or hooked
[2023-01-05 17:43:42] <Spookychiptune> @alexmenace it's the exhaustion
[2023-01-05 17:43:43] <%EvilD34d> i wish it was oblivious instead of blindness or maybe both
[2023-01-05 17:44:06] <SarahlMS> you cant run third seal, or it procs on special attack?
[2023-01-05 17:44:07] <AlexMenace> @Spookychiptune got it. thank you!
[2023-01-05 17:44:37] <DesertYoshi> Third Seal is Special Attack as well

[2023-01-05 17:44:47] <DesertYoshi> That was a couple of patches ago
[2023-01-05 17:45:26] <+suIIyboy> @firelily3223 but honestly how often do you communicate that you got hit, unless you just happen to mention it, or are sweating.  SWFs would probably adjust, but I think that'd actually nerf most SWF groups as well (hiding HUD)
[2023-01-05 17:45:30] <SarahlMS> I'm sure someone will come with an idea on how to use it
[2023-01-05 17:45:32] <MsP1nhead> I think it’d be neat if the blindness status effect hid the new survivor hud, blindness as it is isn’t too powerful
[2023-01-05 17:45:51] <uhmzachh> hey hens!
[2023-01-05 17:45:56] <DesertYoshi> @MsP1nhead That would be a nerf to Solo but not SWF
[2023-01-05 17:46:08] <Slippy030> damn that ping
[2023-01-05 17:46:20] <MsP1nhead> @desertyoshi true I was trying to think of a way to buff blindness
[2023-01-05 17:46:32] <!%+FireLily3223> @suIIyboy I think swfs would adjust too quickly and then the change would only be hurting solo queue yet again Sadge
[2023-01-05 17:46:44] VIEWERS: 1 011
[2023-01-05 17:46:45] <+suIIyboy> and Tbf blindness is already hard countered by communication
[2023-01-05 17:46:54] <DesertYoshi> @MsP1nhead yeah, it's hard to buff that effect. But I just had an idea

[2023-01-05 17:47:26] <DesertYoshi> What if Blindness kept you from seeing the Killer from further than 24 meters, like Sadako and Freddy?
[2023-01-05 17:47:43] <%Tollerwolf> I feel like hooks are still really bad on Eyrie
[2023-01-05 17:47:47] <Kamendere> nice one!

[2023-01-05 17:48:52] <MsP1nhead> @desertyoshi I don’t think it would pass the nurse litmus test either but that would be cool. Sadly seems to be unique to killer powers

[2023-01-05 17:49:13] <Heru_Ra_Ha> @DesertYoshi i think a buff to blindness is needed as right now it is quite useless isnt it?
[2023-01-05 17:49:15] <%Tollerwolf> how long are you supposed to wait
[2023-01-05 17:49:26] <DesertYoshi> It would also make Killer's unable to see survivors past 24 meters as well
[2023-01-05 17:49:36] <%Tollerwolf> that didnt feel like half a second
[2023-01-05 17:49:40] <!%+FireLily3223> @Heru_Ra_Ha I'd honestly disagree with how popular Windows is right now, but that's just my two cents <3
[2023-01-05 17:50:05] <miva420> @DesertYoshi like when the killer has the blindness status effect or when survivors have it
[2023-01-05 17:50:19] <DesertYoshi> @DesertYoshi When the Killer has blindness due to the Haddie Perk
[2023-01-05 17:50:24] <Lapp_the_Wizard> this addon is probably gonna become the new standard for sweaty nurses

[2023-01-05 17:50:57] <%Tollerwolf> blindness is probably the most useless status effect in the game right now i'd say
[2023-01-05 17:51:04] <%Tollerwolf> maybe I miss sth else though
[2023-01-05 17:51:34] <!%+FireLily3223> @Tollerwolf I'm probably biased, but it messes me up pretty badly - I take Windows and Kindred 99% of the time.

[2023-01-05 17:52:34] <!%+FireLily3223> Haha no I do not, Hens. I also don't like to show killers my aura, that's why my 3rd perk is Distortion 99% of the time KEKW

[2023-01-05 17:54:06] <%Tollerwolf> @FireLily3223  It's just cause it ain't meta mostly, I would say and because other status effects just do more. Blindness doesnt have to be that bad, but players want to see value and as killer you don't see value from other people not seeing auras

[2023-01-05 18:09:41] <E1ghtysix> Knight feels better to play as but playing against him is probably exactly as soul destroying as before
[2023-01-05 18:09:52] <E1ghtysix> unless someone's found some crazy counterplay
[2023-01-05 18:10:16] <+suIIyboy> @e1ghtysix it might be a bit better, since Knight is rewarded more for not just insat-dropping guard
[2023-01-05 18:10:23] <DesertYoshi> Should I waste slots on Fixated and Flashlight when playing against your nurse? I haven't used that strat before
[2023-01-05 18:10:27] <+suIIyboy> so they might do it less
[2023-01-05 18:10:35] <E1ghtysix> but he isn't *punished* for doing it
[2023-01-05 18:10:37] <modmarki> one direction = out of the game

[2023-01-05 18:19:07] <%+pribzz> need all new mental timing such a struggle hensDed

[2023-01-05 18:19:24] <DesertYoshi> OHhh. I don't get to join Sadge. GG whoever popped in
[2023-01-05 18:19:31] <+MiserEnoch> @waltonbago Except for knock downs as Victor. That causes a five second delay to switch
[2023-01-05 18:19:35] <%waltonbago> @miserenoch ahh ok ty
[2023-01-05 18:20:04] <railgun_whatever_> Do you consume your live server add-ons by using them in PTB?
[2023-01-05 18:20:17] <%+DerKoaLa22> Heyoooo Hens and chat! hensHi hensHi
[2023-01-05 18:20:18] <DesertYoshi> Hens you don't have to apologize
[2023-01-05 18:20:19] <horsey_4> @railgun_whatever_ no
[2023-01-05 18:20:20] <+MiserEnoch> @Hens333 Yeah. usually, twins has a five second cool down on switch and a reverse flash bang of black on the screen. That's gone with the PTB.
[2023-01-05 18:20:31] <TheManFromTheEgg> I think that it is more bug than buff, but we still dont know for sure.
[2023-01-05 18:20:43] <Leukodystrophy> They confirmed it was a bug
[2023-01-05 18:20:49] <%ClussyHonks> @Hens333 im hearing abuot the whole youtube demonetization anyhting new yet or no?

[2023-01-05 18:20:56] <%+pribzz> very very good patch i hope each mid chapter keeps up with changing a problematic killer, whether they are too weak or strong
[2023-01-05 18:21:00] <Leukodystrophy> Yes
[2023-01-05 18:21:04] <%helllcate_> my theory is twins rework stuff in progress accidentally getting into the build
[2023-01-05 18:21:26] <Leukodystrophy> I can post the link to the confirmation if you'd like.
[2023-01-05 18:21:43] <%ClussyHonks> fookin' based youtube
[2023-01-05 18:21:55] <DesertYoshi> You can switch while either is in cooldown
[2023-01-05 18:21:58] <+MiserEnoch> Yeah. Switching live. But also you noticed how you started moving as soon as you switched, @Hens333 ? That doesn't work normally. normally it's five seconds before you can even start moving
[2023-01-05 18:22:12] <EneAkita> Yeah, try switching quickly between the two
[2023-01-05 18:22:26] <horsey_4> LOL

[2023-01-05 18:22:42] <EneAkita> SEE??
[2023-01-05 18:22:43] <Vuyhz> That was nuts wtf LUL
[2023-01-05 18:22:48] <+suIIyboy> you can also swing/grab immediately after switching
[2023-01-05 18:22:49] <BlightedCat> What was that??

[2023-01-05 18:22:59] <+MiserEnoch> @toooth No nine second stun AND no reverse flash bang
[2023-01-05 18:23:00] <+jarnoderechte> ...
[2023-01-05 18:23:33] <BenOfMilam> I hope they keep it lol
[2023-01-05 18:23:43] <horsey_4> no way you can literally control both at once
[2023-01-05 18:23:52] <toooth> I hope this stays
[2023-01-05 18:23:52] <Alittar> twins no longer waiting 500 years to switch between their power
[2023-01-05 18:23:56] <%ClussyHonks> so this is a bug right? in the near future Twins will be traash again right?
[2023-01-05 18:24:05] <TheManFromTheEgg> You can even hit someone / pick up without animation right after switching. @Hens333

[2023-01-05 18:24:08] <Leukodystrophy> Mandy confirmed it was not intended and is a bug
[2023-01-05 18:24:18] <AsteriaFreya> Sadge
[2023-01-05 18:24:22] <ChristopherMino> it really should have been like that from the start.
[2023-01-05 18:24:23] <+MiserEnoch> @Hens333 No. Usually you have a five to eight second stun without being able to move.
[2023-01-05 18:24:26] <AsteriaFreya> no twins buff Sadge

[2023-01-05 18:25:02] <Alittar> @cosmic_kimchi no twins cd
[2023-01-05 18:25:04] <Mr_Wriggle> is the cooldown after downing someone with victor still long?
[2023-01-05 18:25:05] <BenOfMilam> @TheManFromTheEgg you could do this before, but only if someone pallet stuns charlotte while you are controlling victor and you have end+fury and dormant hood
[2023-01-05 18:25:21] <soopyGG> mandy confirmed it as a bug in the forums
[2023-01-05 18:25:23] <cosmic_kimchi> oh wtf
[2023-01-05 18:25:30] <toooth> Prayge Mandy please keep it in the game
[2023-01-05 18:25:32] <DesertYoshi> @Hens333 the Buckle Up buff in this PTB wasn't mentioned either
[2023-01-05 18:25:36] <SolariumGarden> what is the thing we thought was a bug regarding twins? i just joined in :O
[2023-01-05 18:25:38] <%the_oracle_> sadako's condemn highlighnting the portraits after each stack was never in patchnotes either
[2023-01-05 18:25:53] <soopyGG> @Hens333 mandy confirmed it as a bug in the forums

[2023-01-05 18:26:19] <TheManFromTheEgg> @BenOfMilam yeah, but now it is basekit, but apparently it is bug so...

[2023-01-05 18:26:27] <BenOfMilam> I feel like devs at BHVR go rogue a lot and do whatever they want and don't include it in the patch notes

[2023-01-05 18:27:28] <N64FanTV> Even if they just halved the slow after the switch back it would be miles better. The sluggish movement is just aaargh
