[2022-12-30 01:35:55] <+Damon_Afta> and 30mins
[2022-12-30 01:35:57] <%JayPlays> Scav timers are between 10-15 for me, every time, all day
[2022-12-30 01:36:00] <%Gerberbaby4> Scav queues have just been bad today
[2022-12-30 01:36:04] <Leshracftw> my scavs on customs take 3 minutes, woods 5  and reserve 10
[2022-12-30 01:36:04] <weremoose13> I pressed BACK and it loaded up lol

[2022-12-30 01:36:18] <%$kleinEdeit23> one thing i noticed was /even with auto servers) that if u duo scav its much faster
[2022-12-30 01:36:19] <%ogjoker88> No bc a reserve scav is less then 5 min and there is like 0 pmc's on that map
[2022-12-30 01:36:21] <Enabled_Gamer> do i need to set up the auto chrome extension?

[2022-12-30 01:36:27] <$PROBLEMxGAMING> my reserve scavs been taking less than 6
[2022-12-30 01:36:28] <%Sapper04> customs and woods is where a lot of players are doing quests still
[2022-12-30 01:36:31] <%Crawlern> imagine being able to play
[2022-12-30 01:36:35] <%Nykademus> They need to open up more instances. They know that post wipe is going to be busy.

[2022-12-30 01:37:35] <+Triksta6> Factory SCAV runs have been taking me about 5mins on average
[2022-12-30 01:37:35] <ButSureLook> I get 20+ on all maps, dont listen
[2022-12-30 01:37:35] <%Gerberbaby4> I just sat for 15 mins on reserve gingy

[2022-12-30 01:37:48] <rawmentik> I'M waiting 12 minuters for a Scav on Reserve
[2022-12-30 01:37:50] <%nopeboats> more people live in the east
[2022-12-30 01:37:50] <%Sapper04> Region matters because of time of day and population density :P
[2022-12-30 01:37:51] <%+MadMoneyM> Earlier

[2022-12-30 01:38:12] <$Dale_B0203> only way that could be true is if they factored ping into match time
[2022-12-30 01:38:15] <%nopeboats> KEKW
[2022-12-30 01:38:16] <Royoneal213> It's possible that servers aren't hyperconverged, so that each region is actually the servers separated which could lead to longer queue times in areas like Eastern US

[2022-12-30 03:26:32] <Dolac84> The new audio is fantastic, especially if you use proper spatial audio codecs with windows (Atmos or DTS:X, I found DTS:X to be the best)
[2022-12-30 03:26:48] <olternaut> Nikita will fix it as a top priority no doubt.  He's proud that he implemented his own audio solution.
[2022-12-30 03:26:56] <%Thaloc78> @MetroKills Really, I was on reserve on top floor next to medical building, i could hear some one in the medical building and the sound was coming from above me..... the medical building is only 2 floors
[2022-12-30 03:27:01] <%+SebastianVonRyan> I heard turning off binaural audio helps with fps...people saying much lower fps with it on
[2022-12-30 03:27:04] <Dolac84> Oculus Audio uses HRTF, you have to use an HRTF codec to realize the full function of the new engine
[2022-12-30 03:27:04] <olternaut> @Dolac84 how do you implement that in game?

[2022-12-30 03:29:17] <%+onekillwalter> you traded!
[2022-12-30 03:29:19] <Dolac84> @Prodiod Without the actual codec, you are getting a simulated experience, where with the actual HRTF codecs running they accurately identify item tagging in the space around the player, in full spherical 360 suround, not just a single plane of 360
[2022-12-30 03:29:20] <%CaerusBlue> fucking hell the train horn on reserve didnt work

[2022-12-30 03:29:47] <%+SebastianVonRyan> bullets were hitting dirt to the right of him when he was close...aim was good but bullet looked right
[2022-12-30 03:29:48] <olternaut> @Dolac84 that sounds like something Nikita should have explained to players.
[2022-12-30 03:29:57] <jonathan_regan> Shots have no been registering lately, happening for Trip and Poolshark earlier
[2022-12-30 03:29:58] <olternaut> @Dolac84 I'm definitely investigating that!
[2022-12-30 03:30:02] <bionic_lemming> I'm a little miffed. I signed up for this just now, but was unable to get my usual user name. buh.
[2022-12-30 03:30:05] <Dolac84> @olternaut Windows has Windows Sonic, which is their free, not good variant of the others, its not included with windows because the user has to have a license for the codec
[2022-12-30 03:30:07] <%Thaloc78> Yes... but desync will give you a blood splatter on your screen... but doesn;t actually hit him
[2022-12-30 03:30:08] <%+toxikstrudel> @jakeyx420 WeirdChamp
[2022-12-30 03:30:08] <Prodiod> @Dolac84 I'll try windows sonic and see if it's different. if not, maybe ill get the other ones. thanks
[2022-12-30 03:30:19] <jammy7512> I think maybe you hit the arm and not the torso

[2022-12-30 03:31:06] <barra_yvl> maybe hit between the arm and body idk if that's possible
[2022-12-30 03:31:16] <Dolac84> @olternaut Literally no game company explains this when they implement proper HRTF, CoD 2019, doesnt mention Atmos support, you have to search for it and find out that its there if you select the "Studio Audio" selection
[2022-12-30 03:31:36] <+GhostGamer_2328> Yes
[2022-12-30 03:31:37] <jonathan_regan> Trip and poolshark both shot scavs in leg and seen blood splatter and it didn’t register the hits still.

[2022-12-30 03:32:33] <Dolac84> @Prodiod Sonic is dog doodoo, but it does /sorta/ it most often just "widens" the sound scape, but doesnt actually lift anything it should like the others... like foot steps
[2022-12-30 03:33:03] <+Nephilimator> How does DMCA work with streaming? You can just play anything or are you paying something a month to play music without DMCA hits?

[2022-12-30 03:34:00] <%+rafatole> @Nephilimator She uses something call dual track audio, i think
[2022-12-30 03:34:16] <olternaut> so i should be looking for the Atmos codec?

[2022-12-30 03:41:08] <Dolac84> @olternaut I use both, some games are better with the other, but DTS:X tends to be the one that sounds and works best with most games, even ones that dont directly support HRTF, it will fall back on simulated HRTF

[2022-12-30 03:52:43] <tysoniner> @olternaut heh nice haha so you can start offline raids then practice finding yourself on a map you have up; also learn how to take a positional fix using orienteering style compass barring (or just memorize the whole map). Then you go do raids and try to find the hidden stashes. After like 2 months of that you’ll be able to find where you are in the dark.

[2022-12-30 16:29:03] <%nopeboats> is it like rbak room on reserve?
[2022-12-30 16:29:04] <+Grimour> marked room is not that much different than the drop down room in reserve

[2022-12-30 16:29:24] <KillAhBite> theres a key. Called abandon building marked room key with 10 uses
[2022-12-30 16:29:28] <OPWarmachin3> either way arent most marked rooms garbage still?
[2022-12-30 16:29:34] <%CaerusBlue> bsg stated they wont simply because they gotta find it and QA kinda is hard
[2022-12-30 16:29:36] <@%+jimmiedrum> cause there is a key for drop down, right?
