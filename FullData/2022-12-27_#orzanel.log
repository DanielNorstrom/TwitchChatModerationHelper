[2022-12-27 14:23:32] <@%$superreiska> skill-based mm would also be pretty nasty since while all tanks are equal, some are just even more equal than others

[2022-12-27 14:36:15] <ARPouret> nah i think people just want to be able to practice versus getting 1 shot killed Nazz - but the game requires practice and skill and the only way to learn is to keep playing it
[2022-12-27 14:37:16] <@%$superreiska> to be fair sticking to lower tiers would make the learning easier

[2022-12-27 14:41:05] <domw_> I wish wg had put more effort into learning tools earlier on, and maybe added a basic casual game mode for people to practice in
[2022-12-27 14:41:09] <gioiceberg> What u guys consider best tiers to learn the game?
[2022-12-27 14:41:14] <domw_> randoms matter too much to people

[2022-12-27 14:41:44] <ARPouret> If you're learning?  Tier 2.  That's probably the best if you're just starting out.  Or watch a channel like this and learn some 'moves;

[2022-12-27 14:44:34] <ARPouret> Im not accusing dude?  Whats your problem?  Gioce is asking questions man - im not razzing your gameplay
[2022-12-27 14:44:52] <Bogdicool> still recommanding tier 2 is a bit sussy
[2022-12-27 14:44:59] <domw_> it's pretty easy to learn to do sealclubbing damage in low tiers if you actually try to benefit from what the tiers offer you

[2022-12-27 14:52:07] <Bogdicool> @opBeasty Cant agree more, Id say dont really judge anyone in general, play the game at your own pace and will, if you consume yourself with everyone around you, dont play multiplayer games arguable

[2022-12-27 14:52:46] <domw_> @opBeasty being angry at other players all the time just completely ruins ur game to the point where it makes zero sense to play in the first place

[2022-12-27 14:53:22] <domw_> the game does encourage people to be toxic because winning is important, but at the end of the day it's the people being toxic, not the game

[2022-12-27 14:54:26] <domw_> @Orzanel I mean the daily bonuses etc, people overrate how much those matter
[2022-12-27 14:54:29] <%yuristylez> I think winning is important. If I contribute to a win, I feel good.
[2022-12-27 14:54:30] <%fmvgomes> u know it wasn't wot that created toxicity right? I play online for like 20 years and people were toxic back in the day as well PixelBob
[2022-12-27 14:54:37] <%yuristylez> I am not into my performance
[2022-12-27 14:54:38] <domw_> I do agree it isn't important lol
[2022-12-27 14:54:48] <+MidnightSociety> People just need to play the game for fun, not like its my job
[2022-12-27 14:54:50] <+Kobila49> @Orzanel winning is important if you grinding money with premiums :D
[2022-12-27 14:54:52] <Bogdicool> Well as long as you get rewarded for your own performance, win or lose is useless
[2022-12-27 14:54:57] <rek28> most people only care about winning. i dont understand why they dont pick smthg they are good at instead. they will see that winning can be boring
[2022-12-27 14:55:16] <domw_> I just wanna feel like I did my role and job right
[2022-12-27 14:55:23] <%fmvgomes> everyone plays for fun either if you are playing for stats, now u can choose to be a dick or not, is that simple OpieOP
[2022-12-27 14:55:23] <Bogdicool> @Kobila49 Yes and no, have 500 damage on a win and make less then 2k on a defeat

[2022-12-27 15:05:43] <%fmvgomes> but IMO if u decide to be the eyes of ur team u need at least 3x ur HP worth of spot to break even
