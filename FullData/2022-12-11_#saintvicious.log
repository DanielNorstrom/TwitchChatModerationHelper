[2022-12-11 07:50:29] <JinSoul7> Threat K6 as an assa would be cool

[2022-12-11 08:10:36] <%bizkuto> @mintyhippo67 imo she's a decent AD item holder through stage 3. Problem is she's single target and doesn't hit priority targets so she can fall off hard if you don't have other carries

[2022-12-11 09:05:53] <%julesSuperHD> it accounts for units in play right? otherwise it would be broken. There are like 12 zeds in the deck?
[2022-12-11 09:06:02] <RitoSux> it doesnt
[2022-12-11 09:06:16] <%julesSuperHD> what?! yeah that was some terrible luck then
[2022-12-11 09:07:13] <sdillett> does bel veth ever stabilize with those items if zed is so contested or is that just a guarenteed 8th?

[2022-12-11 11:17:43] <$MTVaughn> range is so powerful

[2022-12-11 15:28:54] <+decisivetft> @tiipzyy genuinely dont think he needs nerfed, i think tanks other than sej ekko need buffed and shit like samira and 3 cost carries need buffed outside of jax
[2022-12-11 15:29:13] <0nigirIie> for sure Kappa
[2022-12-11 15:29:54] <screamlurn> urgot ap or ad carry?

[2022-12-11 15:30:26] <MrGuy300> @tiipzyy it doesnt need nerf it just needs the hacker bug to be fixed and it'll stop being OP

[2022-12-11 15:44:42] <tryeu> could be worst u could have ur items on a lvl 1 kayle
[2022-12-11 15:44:48] <InqInc> ^ that's true
[2022-12-11 15:45:11] <lofiqiyana> is senna with items and sivir > ashe stronger here dzuThinking
[2022-12-11 15:45:24] <+tiipzyy> level up is only good if you get the all gold opener
[2022-12-11 15:45:42] <+tiipzyy> as a stage 2 prismatic that is
[2022-12-11 15:45:43] <+YoSmashjoy> How come Saint wasn't invited to TFT summit?
[2022-12-11 15:45:47] <0nigirIie> idk I kinda hate level up late also
[2022-12-11 15:45:47] <brakiros> Level Up is terrible compared to High End Shopping and Wise Spending
[2022-12-11 15:45:55] <+bobbedies> yeah i feel it doesnt really change much about your early game, people are still mostly keeping up with your level + having an actual prismatic :D
[2022-12-11 15:46:02] <InqInc> Yeah I feel like having Ashe and Senna in Laser 3 is kinda bad because neither of them will ever get all 3 drones until it's too late
[2022-12-11 15:46:06] <+larn123> damn we poor
[2022-12-11 15:46:23] <einchoi> !comps
[2022-12-11 15:46:23] <@^StreamElements> Set 8 Comps https://imgur.com/a/qzWaM3E
[2022-12-11 15:46:27] <InqInc> Oh no Ashe is great I love playing Lasers lol
[2022-12-11 15:47:00] <+larn123> one more win and 2 more losses
[2022-12-11 15:47:05] <+larn123> I believe
[2022-12-11 15:47:07] <brakiros> Ashe and Senna together is terrible simply because Senna is so fake
[2022-12-11 15:47:08] <%Zedaine112> that man knows how to sit on a fence
[2022-12-11 15:47:10] <InqInc> I just think "optimal" 3 lasers is Yasuo over Senna because you want Renekton and Yasuo to give drones to Ashe
[2022-12-11 15:47:11] <+YoSmashjoy> this set doesn't have a lot of front line?
[2022-12-11 15:47:35] <tryeu> this set has the most front lane sincxe idk
[2022-12-11 15:47:41] <+Arcane_Eli> oh yeah it does
[2022-12-11 15:47:53] <0nigirIie> Opponent goes 3-2 7, instantly hits zed. Saint goes 3-2 7, hits rammus
[2022-12-11 15:47:59] <0nigirIie> sounds about right
[2022-12-11 15:48:00] <brakiros> @YoSmashjoy this set has the highest number of viable frontliners then any other set that I can remember lol
[2022-12-11 15:48:17] <+YoSmashjoy> thanks, i only played 1 game
[2022-12-11 15:48:18] <tryeu> this set lacks on backlane access
[2022-12-11 15:48:29] <tryeu> since no sins
[2022-12-11 15:48:32] <+MeniteTom> How do you build Samira, just raw AD?
