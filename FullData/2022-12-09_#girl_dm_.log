[2022-12-09 21:23:08] <NopeTooFast> @hewoitskai and i'm saying that if you've played original, you'll know that a significant amount of the changes in royal are QoL changes - including a lot of the new mechanics, which make the game very, very much easier. vanilla was pretty much artificially difficult since morgana would force you in at night a lot, lot more, but you are very much wrong about royal being harder.

[2022-12-09 22:10:59] <%$Rhipose> Looking into mod sound boards, it appears that there is a work around where the streamer sits in a discord call with a bot with the mods activating commands to make sounds through the bot as they're redeemed, but that's not really a solution.
