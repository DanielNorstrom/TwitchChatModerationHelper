[2022-12-19 15:49:29] <%looteverybody> Basically a "back to basics" for gaming
[2022-12-19 15:49:29] <+RCShelto> graphics not at the expense of gameplay really
[2022-12-19 15:49:29] <%steves_garage> really only simulation games need photorealism

One day whilst The Intruder was out treasure hunting, Jakob summoned Nyarlathotep to Dusk and Nyarlathotep gave Jakob and his followers QUAKE Powers (Speed, Strength, Endurance, Resilience amongst other things). Slowly they began to take over the town, converting people in followers and killing those who refused or resisted.

[2022-12-19 16:32:48] <%Pint0fBeer> @keith46256  The Intruder and his wife lived in the town of Dusk, alongside Jakob who was secretly building a small cult dedicated to Nyarlathotep. One day whilst The Intruder was out treasure hunting, Jakob summoned Nyarlathotep to Dusk and Nyarlathotep gave Jakob and his followers QUAKE Powers (Speed, Strength, Endurance, Resilience amongst other things). Slowly they began to take over the town, converting people in followers and killing those who refused or resisted.

[2022-12-19 16:34:56] <BlktoothGrN> @quizzub that whole genre is kinda hard to get into when you have Twilight Princess to compare it to
[2022-12-19 16:34:56] <%AdamTheFeverish> is Gloomwood good? I understand it has a slower pace
[2022-12-19 16:34:59] <FrsMns> Wait, the WHOLE thing came out? I thought it was just like, the first two episodes
[2022-12-19 16:34:59] <%clumsy_cultist> cultic is fucking amazing

[2022-12-19 16:35:25] <%TruzzL> wasn't there a boomer shooter called prey a while back? not the space game
[2022-12-19 16:35:25] <%Kentonftw> Forgive Me Father is a boomer shooter with Lovecraftian vibes
[2022-12-19 16:35:25] <%$Squ0g> This level @AdamTheFeverish Gloomwood is really cool, but it's more like Theif than a shooter
[2022-12-19 16:35:29] <%thejumpingmouse> I'm hoping BoltGun is good. We might get Barb to play a Warhammer IP with that game

[2022-12-19 16:39:02] <%blazedmarshadow> games that look like this let you be more creative with atmosphere and tone
[2022-12-19 16:39:02] <%+Tugboat5000> I would usually rather play a stylized game than a photo realistic game

[2022-12-19 16:39:11] <%DOCTOR_SCURVY> some people like the visuals to be sharp as the gameplay
[2022-12-19 16:39:11] <%Zxyyr> i generally trust a game that looks like this more cause there tends to be a higher focus on gameplay

[2022-12-19 16:39:18] <+desktp> the thing with dusk and the plethora of followers, is that dusk understood exactly what you're saying. it doesn't just look old for the sake of looking old
[2022-12-19 16:39:20] <+MeepAhoy> game gives me massive blood vibes
[2022-12-19 16:39:21] <%rebelappliance> smoke and particle effects on point

[2022-12-19 16:39:36] <%homestar440> @Zxyyr that's why I really like pixel art games, I love the style, but I know it's not gonna be the main focus of the devs
[2022-12-19 16:39:37] <%+kazu593> they didn't make that though
[2022-12-19 16:39:38] <%olegplaygame> downwell is way way way better the shovel knight dig

[2022-12-19 16:39:41] <%+IdolizeDT> yeah the low ambient track gives off HUGE quake vibes, whereas Amid Evil is a little more intense and then Ultrakill is just over the top sensory overload in a great way. All by this dev
[2022-12-19 16:39:44] <%XCVIIXCVIIXCVIIXCVIIXCVII> sorry i wasnt sure if you heard. yeah dig sucked. this looks good though. zelda esque style?
[2022-12-19 16:39:45] <%delicioustoast4> yeah hyper realistic graphics and mo cap and such takes so much from the budget of actually making the game you know, good
[2022-12-19 16:39:46] <@%$DanTheVP> yeah Mina will acutuall be developed by Yacht Club
[2022-12-19 16:39:47] <%GnastyGnork_> Same but they didnt develop Dig they just paid for it

[2022-12-19 17:01:00] <%$Biff_Ironbarge> Narrator for Bastion is the voice of Hades
[2022-12-19 17:01:01] <%ecstaticbroccoli> DD definitely better
[2022-12-19 17:01:01] <%$AsteriskX> Narrator, yeah
[2022-12-19 17:01:01] <%$theEntropic> NODDERS
[2022-12-19 17:01:04] <%LordRochester> yeee
[2022-12-19 17:01:04] <%ShiraNoMai> he narrates the game
[2022-12-19 17:01:04] <%fight_this> narrator
[2022-12-19 17:01:04] <%+Corking118> i've never played bastion but that is a HOT take.
[2022-12-19 17:01:04] <%AdamTheFeverish> narrator
[2022-12-19 17:01:04] <%xdeepsx> yes, it's a story driven game
[2022-12-19 17:01:05] <%+gabe_the_engineer> the whole game is narrated in real time
[2022-12-19 17:01:06] <%+seedmole> yeah very iconic one
[2022-12-19 17:01:06] <%+Tugboat5000> Yeah, there's a narrator
[2022-12-19 17:01:07] <%SinfulC> Narrator, not announcer
[2022-12-19 17:01:07] <%Bootbunny> You'll find out soon enough
[2022-12-19 17:01:07] <%$theEntropic> narrator, yea
[2022-12-19 17:01:08] <%DynamiteJustice> Bastion for sure
[2022-12-19 17:01:08] <%RomanHero> Narrator
[2022-12-19 17:01:08] <%$Xel562> yes it's the guy who voiced Hades in Hades
[2022-12-19 17:01:09] <@%$deejay4am> There is a full on narrator in Bastion and it rocks
[2022-12-19 17:01:10] <%LordRochester> sort of like hades
[2022-12-19 17:01:10] <%Dante_Draco> The Narrator.

[2022-12-19 17:01:19] <%+Slacks_McMasters> Bastion is so good
[2022-12-19 17:01:20] <%+AnimusAja> The narrator in Bastion narrated based on how you act. Or not act
[2022-12-19 17:01:21] <%$Dingusamingus> @Corking118 He's REALLY good
[2022-12-19 17:01:25] <Kraelan> Bastion and Transistor have a great narrator.
[2022-12-19 17:01:25] <%+R1NZL3R_87> The narrator in Bastion narrates *everything* you do.. Even bonking walls with hammers, Barb
[2022-12-19 17:01:27] <%destructo__spin> Shhhh @animusaja
[2022-12-19 17:01:34] <%DonkeyMintInc> @rolling_thunderr No

[2022-12-19 17:01:43] <%Nozdrum> half the game is the announcer and music, like darkest dungeon

[2022-12-19 17:02:33] <%$mainlymike> if you're playing this you gotta play Half Life 1
[2022-12-19 17:02:35] <%higHChloride> heretic crossbow?

[2022-12-19 17:02:54] <itscaw> HL1 is fantastic
[2022-12-19 17:02:54] <%ShiraNoMai> Black Mesa, then
[2022-12-19 17:02:55] <AttackTeam_> huh
[2022-12-19 17:02:55] <%+Diabeticcyborg> half life is so good
[2022-12-19 17:02:57] <%thorry84> Black Mesa is the best

[2022-12-19 17:02:57] <%higHChloride> yeaaa that's the Heretic crossbow
[2022-12-19 17:02:59] <Kalrok> KEKW
[2022-12-19 17:03:01] <+morbid478> uh yeah you should play half life. I never played it myself until a couple of months ago
[2022-12-19 17:03:01] <%$Scoutyx> PENTAKILL
[2022-12-19 17:03:01] <%+Corking118> @R1NZL3R_87 now that i think about it i think I've played the first ten minutes of bastion. i remember the music being good
[2022-12-19 17:03:04] <%+tenlittlepiggies> That’s wild. Play it
[2022-12-19 17:03:05] <s2krazykarl> @Dingusamingus Setting Sail, Coming Home is such a good song.
[2022-12-19 17:03:09] <itscaw> I would recommend playing the original and then Black Mesa afterwards though
[2022-12-19 17:03:13] <%GnastyGnork_> KKonaW
[2022-12-19 17:03:13] <%delicioustoast4> you ahve to play half life 1 that is the grandfather of story games, at least fps ones
[2022-12-19 17:03:13] <%Spinjump19> Black Mesa is an excellent HL1 remake
[2022-12-19 17:03:14] <%CarbonAxiom> Black Mesa would be an amazing Marbles pick, for anyone listening in chat
[2022-12-19 17:03:16] <%NGdoc> duke & duke, inc.
[2022-12-19 17:03:16] <%Nufi_ChanDussy> HL1 have nothing in common to this game tho

[2022-12-19 17:03:18] <NotShocked> Black mesa is the way to play HL1 (its a remake)

[2022-12-19 17:03:33] <%+Corking118> @R1NZL3R_87 or maybe i played transistor? fighting was kind of on a grid, I think?

[2022-12-19 17:03:42] <%+FriedBologn> I think he should play the original Half-Life first. If he likes it he can play Black Mesa.

[2022-12-19 17:22:42] <%$sco00bysnacks> a lot of these kids dont have any role models and have no resources, teachers are trying so hard to help them and the parents dont give a fuck
[2022-12-19 17:22:42] <%+BrainstormLaw> Left litigation for teaching. Teaching is harder.

[2022-12-19 17:23:08] <+Killsmith_> Honestly that saying should describe an ideal situation.  You do the thing until you can't anymore, then teach other people how to do it.

[2022-12-19 17:23:22] <%SkoSoSy> A place where “those who can’t do teach” is hilariously incorrect is in music. I studied music in college and the professors were all INCREDIBLY gifted at their respective instruments

[2022-12-19 17:23:40] <%DistastefulGamer> I feel like that saying is more directed to instructors of sports and more skill oriented tasks instead of knowledge
[2022-12-19 17:23:42] <%+Jbowser686> eh I had some college professors who "did" more than they "taught", they were terrible teachers only really focused on their own work with little effort put towards helping students
