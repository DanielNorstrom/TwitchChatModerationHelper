[2023-01-02 18:18:22] <seoliart> Think its just a separate audio channel that is just discarded/disabled in the vod.

[2023-01-02 18:18:27] <EthanShulman> video is already separate image and audio streams, its just swapping out that audio stream
[2023-01-02 18:18:29] <kabookos> windoiws 3.11 isd still best windows
[2023-01-02 18:18:34] <$B00MCAKE> omg have you ever had twitch say "hey nows a good time to remind people to follow" its such a weird thing they started doing. It just makes you wanna be like "well now I'm NOT GONNA" >:(
[2023-01-02 18:18:34] <%pzn01> i guess twitch kinda renders the live stream and the vod separately
[2023-01-02 18:18:45] <%Twigbot4k> Makes sense to me.  Audio usually features various sound channels.  Combo'ed into a final result.  Sometimes many different sound stream channels.

[2023-01-02 18:19:52] <kabookos> some  onf twitches music rules are silly likes strikes over music in the backlground of games
[2023-01-02 18:19:54] <%Twigbot4k> Now, if your chatting voice sound channel, you were yourself also playing an instrument, having it go through the mic, that would hit the PC as a single sound channel source.  Trickier to split that.
[2023-01-02 18:19:58] <%Slime_> doogHi curseLuv @Dojumz
[2023-01-02 18:20:07] <+SpencerAWest> It is challenging, and the situation fo the DMCA stuff should be addressed. until then you kind of have to do what you can
[2023-01-02 18:20:17] <%+SynergistN7> so this no music vod is a feature in obs? recording the vod without the music audio channel?

[2023-01-02 18:33:01] <%AtomicPandas> are there borrowed signs from multiple sign languages? can someone have 2 dialects while signing? Thonk
[2023-01-02 18:33:03] <TylerDrake1790> @wholeycow333 i completely get that; like i said, just never really thought about that, but it makes sense really
[2023-01-02 18:33:16] <%RMutt1917> like dialects in the same country
[2023-01-02 18:33:20] <+Sffau> I work with adults with learning disabilities, lots of them use sign. Some of then have their own sign in their social circles, it's so hard to keep track of... haha
[2023-01-02 18:33:29] <@%ArnarBjornss> yeah like the Nordic countries have their own, each. Despite similarities between most.
[2023-01-02 18:33:30] <MattMGK> It would be amazing if it was a mandatory language subject everyone had to do up until X age
[2023-01-02 18:33:40] <+kozakaz> so when they do it on TV for example in here in the US for the POTUS is it just kind of a universal overlap and *most* people will understand the basics of it?
