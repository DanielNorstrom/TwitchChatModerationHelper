[2022-12-03 10:47:06] <%TheGameskate> if disney hadnt squashed their animation department and pushed Don Bluth out, his 1990s films would've be critical and commercial successes and part of the Disney Renaissance era. Anne-Marie from An American Tale and the titular characters from Thumbelina and Anastasia would've been official members in the Disney Princess media franchise.

[2022-12-03 14:41:21] <SilenceoftheFerret> Mostly the harder mining and everything.
[2022-12-03 14:41:38] <%CNStudioo> The Ocean biome did get an update though. Seaweed, more fish, coral and magma blocks.

[2022-12-03 14:42:09] <%Xenyr0> yeah, the vanilla underwater mechanics are kinda boring and just annoying. To have a good experience you kinda have to install more and more mods, sadly
[2022-12-03 14:42:10] <endlesscries> NOTED hate subnautica
[2022-12-03 14:42:11] <neoipun> am i hearing it right
[2022-12-03 14:42:20] <DigiDemonikk> personally i think the mods that add ocean content often scare people as well.   like sea serpents and the drowned throwing tridents downt help either lol

[2022-12-03 16:36:03] <Rubi_Dragon> it's just, do people care about smaller streamers? or even tiny streamers?

[2022-12-03 16:37:05] <Rubi_Dragon> kinda wanted to ask as one of those "tiny streamers"... just trying a thing i've been dreaming of for a while 😅
[2022-12-03 16:37:25] <@%Leemiie> @Rubi_Dragon most the places im regular at are small streamers, or started small and i was there while they grew like candii for example
[2022-12-03 16:37:26] <%SizeableJoker9> so cute
[2022-12-03 16:38:11] <Rubi_Dragon> @Rubi_Dragon neat, fair enough

[2022-12-03 16:43:16] <%2ezFishStick3000> I think you just shouldn't expect things out of people if you do raid, but nothing wrong with it
[2022-12-03 16:44:04] <%2ezFishStick3000> but im not a CC so take that with a grain of salt

[2022-12-03 16:44:36] <Rubi_Dragon> well, i wasn't expecting anything, just thought of it as a way of ending stream, but 4 people followed me for the raid, that's why i felt kinda dirty, like i had somehow leeched off of Candii...
[2022-12-03 16:44:49] <+RoukaVT> ironmouseHihi
[2022-12-03 16:45:13] <Rubi_Dragon> *because of the raid
[2022-12-03 16:45:24] <@%Leemiie> tbh it takes a lot to get to *the vtuber position* like more than just streaming, marketing yourself in socials and creating content and being a part of the community, also knowing your audience and how to target them, a lot of marketing and performing

[2022-12-03 16:46:47] <@%Leemiie> also raids are a support to the person you're raiding more than to yourself, don't expect anything in return and don't target big streams in hope of exposure, just raid ppl who you enjoy and want to support
[2022-12-03 16:47:45] <@%Leemiie> also candii always appreciates all raids and support ^^
[2022-12-03 16:47:56] <Rubi_Dragon> @Leemiie oh i figure, especially if people wanna take it seriously, i kinda just want to try things out as a "persuing / trying a dream thing", i don't expect success from it

[2022-12-03 16:48:53] <@%Leemiie> yea but you kinda framed your words in a *i wish i was like other vtubers* way
[2022-12-03 16:49:29] <@%Leemiie> i don't mind this topic but try not to self promo, rules are rules even if candice is asleep
[2022-12-03 16:49:34] <Rubi_Dragon> @Leemiie i figured it's how it works, you are literally moving your audience into another person's livestream

[2022-12-03 16:50:34] <Rubi_Dragon> @Leemiie that's kinda why i was iffy to ask, i was worried if i'd be treading the line or something.
[2022-12-03 16:51:32] <@%Leemiie> yea, and usually ppl raid someone in a similar category or community, to build relations
[2022-12-03 16:51:54] <%carmelamh> @Leemiie wait candii's name is candice ? i didn't know that but now it seems so obvious lol
[2022-12-03 16:51:55] <Rubi_Dragon> @Leemiie well... it's a dream to be like them, but i understand it's highly unlikely and it comes with it's own stresses. It's a dream, but a highly unlikely one...
