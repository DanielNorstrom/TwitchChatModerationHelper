[2022-12-22 09:17:40] <%Zeroslayer> Madge TeaTime Good morning

[2022-12-22 09:22:02] <%Criptonix100> I feel like I'm fucked in 2023...

[2022-12-22 09:25:34] <%lexx_87> @Criptonix100 Why?
[2022-12-22 09:26:17] <%Criptonix100> Russia could be planning to attack R.Moldova and there are also russian refugees on Serbia so I'm kinda fucked xD
[2022-12-22 09:26:31] <%Criptonix100> I live near Serbia
[2022-12-22 09:26:58] <%lexx_87> Thats scary D:
[2022-12-22 09:28:40] <%Criptonix100> they updated the article and said they could be planning from 'today' but by 2023 it could be a guarantee attack...I hope not
[2022-12-22 09:29:56] <%Criptonix100> I hope my outdated greek ID will suffice if I need to escape
[2022-12-22 09:34:34] <%lexx_87> oh man that sucks
[2022-12-22 09:35:49] <%Criptonix100> yeah I hope for the best but I am also planning to exchange my savings from uni to euros incase of emergency (Romanian leu will prob drop if Moldova gets into war and Romania will obviously help)
[2022-12-22 09:36:02] <%Criptonix100> so I am also planning for the worst...
[2022-12-22 09:45:39] <%Criptonix100> I feel like I shouldn't say a lot of politics here but I gotta love how Austrians and Hungarians are still Romanian's enemies to this day not wanting Romania into Schengen like they are planning something...

[2022-12-22 10:23:38] <Alvic> influence*
[2022-12-22 10:23:39] [Notification] Aeriyah subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 10 months! [My monthly prime as always!]
[2022-12-22 10:23:40] <+PuddingChef> really good to see a roadmap from blizz
[2022-12-22 10:23:41] <+VerdantSol> dang looks like they've got a project manager
[2022-12-22 10:23:41] [Notification] Penry_ subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 68 months! [so close to the magic number]
[2022-12-22 10:23:50] <+Vuoripeikko> also the funni news for today was Activision Blizzard CEO moving to lead the ape movement LUL
[2022-12-22 10:23:54] <+Liftor> have they said anything about artifact weapon enchant transmog?
[2022-12-22 10:23:54] <%KyaranAmanore> @Preachlfw  iirc Mike or Holy said they wanted to keep the patch release date consistent, big Pog
[2022-12-22 10:23:55] <%ravenribb> like 99% companies don't adhere to their roadmaps
[2022-12-22 10:23:56] <%+Supersenkel> "Content und timing subject to change" PepeLaugh
[2022-12-22 10:23:59] <%$Azikielboi> 6 month major patch cycles is really pretty decent
[2022-12-22 10:24:00] <+Itsapaul> catJAM

[2022-12-22 10:24:08] [Notification] cr00ker subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 66 months!
[2022-12-22 10:24:09] <%iainbruX> Honestly, I'm really liking the fact that Holly Longdale is the head of WoW - been good shit so far
[2022-12-22 10:24:12] <Lissard> So all content will be out by end of next year/early 2024? So maybe shorted expansion cycles as well unless last patch is close to a year again
[2022-12-22 10:24:12] <3rayed> catJAM
[2022-12-22 10:24:12] <%+jhazor> also recognising FF is kicking their ass in content
[2022-12-22 10:24:14] <+Vuoripeikko> ah oop COO yeah
[2022-12-22 10:24:16] <+dwolf010> also @preachlfw this is 2023 only. not the hole expansion

[2022-12-22 10:29:05] <%+toveck15> @ravenribb dayz was the best survival game of all time, the mod not the standalone
[2022-12-22 10:29:10] <+Valtheran87> @preachlfw what’s your thoughts on the trading post. As long as the currency isn’t a weekly cap I think it’s a good idea.
[2022-12-22 10:29:11] <%KyaranAmanore> @Garregorn oh no what did they do
[2022-12-22 10:29:14] <ohooliann> Same here

[2022-12-22 10:29:22] <Stinkefedt> I guess we're setting it up that the titans aren't what we thought they were, so why not

[2022-12-22 10:29:22] <+selphares1> Satisfactory :)
[2022-12-22 10:29:25] <Riyshn> exploration with survival elements usually works better than trying to go for pure survival, imo

[2022-12-22 10:32:39] <%$Azikielboi> when, if you would, would u delay the flight home @Preachlfw ?

[2022-12-22 10:34:43] <%magisterofquelthalas> awesome FF music is awesome
[2022-12-22 10:34:47] <+Breadmun> Would you say the other bosses were appropirately tuned?
[2022-12-22 10:34:48] <+destruu> releasing mythic and hc/normal at the same time was a mistake...
[2022-12-22 10:34:49] <BudBudBudBudBudBudBudBudB> @Dernsby even for a non-wow player like me that fight looks like a lot of fun
[2022-12-22 10:34:50] <%+Artemisthemp> The final boss is fine, people this days just expect the boss to die on day 1 instead of 3 month
[2022-12-22 10:34:53] <brackus79> adding jeath to the casting team has been top notch, very very good addition
[2022-12-22 10:34:54] <%Dschonathan> @Elverskinken if their production was better their production would be better NODDERS

[2022-12-22 10:35:19] <archeonyx> jeaths analysis helps me understand wots goin on in the game, ive never played wow but been tuning in for the great banter

[2022-12-22 10:35:25] <%Funderik> problem is liquid are trying to over production their stream and it just feel like good morning britain breakfast show, hard to watch
[2022-12-22 10:35:26] <%+MrBobbas> Imagine testing it before relasing it! LUL
[2022-12-22 10:35:28] <youcantkillthemetal> Yeah the timing before christmas was pretty tight,
[2022-12-22 10:35:35] <SZebra> @Methuzahla Sadge
[2022-12-22 10:35:36] <%+grimwolfuk> did the boss get tested?
[2022-12-22 10:35:36] <%+Artemisthemp> @Artemisthemp Maybe, look ad Yogg - almost 3 month before 0 was killed
[2022-12-22 10:35:36] <+Rhob> I can't understand how you can miss tuning that much, 50% on the shields is massive
[2022-12-22 10:35:37] <iChickenGod> @Preachlfw you gonna do the FF event by any chance or did you already do it
[2022-12-22 10:35:39] <+Matraxxs> 100m shield in 25s is insane
[2022-12-22 10:35:40] <alexanddra> The casting has been so much fun this race, I've been watching constantly

[2022-12-22 10:35:55] <%PaeToWin> @Artemisthemp you know that the RWF raiders have gear that would take normal raiders 1-2 months to get. And even with that gear and their skill level they're hard struggling?
[2022-12-22 10:35:56] <+theoneeleven> @Preachlfw think they are very afraid of over nerfing now, resulting in the current pulling team winning

[2022-12-22 10:41:54] <%+Azalis1701> @Duduu26 It's a bit different since they kill it internally and know it can be done. I would like to see that tried in WoW, but it would probably lead to a 1 or 2 day clear
