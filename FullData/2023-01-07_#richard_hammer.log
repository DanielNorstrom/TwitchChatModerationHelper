[2023-01-07 06:19:03] <%+theTaskManager> I just finished Chained Echoes. damn good 90s RPG. took me 60 ish hours ha. during breaks from hard fights I play Way of the Hunter to chill out.
[2023-01-07 06:19:34] <%+theTaskManager> came out a few weeks ago
[2023-01-07 06:20:09] <pikathulu> I like that other Hunter game we all played a while ago
[2023-01-07 06:20:16] <%+theTaskManager> I never got into actual fishing games. mini games? sure ha
[2023-01-07 06:20:19] <pikathulu> The one where you could build your own lodge. Can't remember its name

[2023-01-07 06:21:13] <%+theTaskManager> sorry 90s style, like if you liked Chrono trigger or Xeno Gears, it's great.

[2023-01-07 06:23:04] <%NullSignal> yep
[2023-01-07 06:23:13] <%+theTaskManager> yeah, I played theHunter Call of the Wild a lot. I like the gun handling in Way of the Hunter a lot better.
[2023-01-07 06:23:15] <%NullSignal> undecided on right clicking
[2023-01-07 06:23:19] <%NullSignal> but i can see how it'd work
[2023-01-07 06:24:13] <%NullSignal> i disagree. i've lost a lot of fish with shift even when dragging across topwater
[2023-01-07 06:24:26] <%NullSignal> and as soon as i stopped shift reeling, i stopped losing fish
[2023-01-07 06:24:32] <%NullSignal> but, it's anecdotal, so who knows
[2023-01-07 06:24:34] VIEWERS: 118
[2023-01-07 06:25:10] <%NullSignal> 100%
[2023-01-07 06:25:20] <%NullSignal> now, i DO shift reel to take up slack
[2023-01-07 06:25:21] <pikathulu> I'd imagine the meta on this game to be extremely deep.
[2023-01-07 06:25:35] <%+bortz29> well shit then i just suck, i barely shift click and i lose a bunch i feel
[2023-01-07 06:26:24] <%NullSignal> i use only good hooks and i toss them as soon as they've got 1% damage on em

[2023-01-07 06:26:55] <%NullSignal> that's for single hooks, not trebles. i don't know if it matters as much on trebles
[2023-01-07 06:27:00] <%+bortz29> probably not, i have no clue what i'm doing as far as gear, the stuff i have is all kits
[2023-01-07 06:27:09] <%NullSignal> no, you gotta catch a ton of fish for a hook to take damage, but they do eventually take damage
[2023-01-07 06:27:27] <%NullSignal> catchin hogs, man
[2023-01-07 06:28:30] <%NullSignal> i also feel like leader damage contributes to losing fish

[2023-01-07 06:29:19] <%NullSignal> i feel like i lose more big ones but that may just be because i remember those more
[2023-01-07 06:29:56] <%Brophdog88> I feel I lose the most fish trolling
[2023-01-07 06:30:24] <%Brophdog88> yeah but Im lazy

[2023-01-07 06:32:11] <classicrawxd> put a clip 15, so that I wouldn't have to struggle so much while pulling out the fish

[2023-01-07 06:39:41] <%EpicPumaNess> good morning chat and Dick
[2023-01-07 06:39:57] <%Brophdog88> how much you float fish probably inflates that number too
[2023-01-07 06:40:12] <%Brophdog88> since you dont lose fish telescopicing
[2023-01-07 06:40:30] <%Dazziv> haha yeah I had all those "pack" reels and I saw the mech numbers and wanted to test them myself lol
[2023-01-07 06:40:44] VIEWERS: 159
[2023-01-07 06:40:51] <%Brophdog88> so for reference, Ive caught 510 fish float fishing
[2023-01-07 06:40:51] <+nomnom345> the thud of the fish is so satisfying.
[2023-01-07 06:40:59] <%Brophdog88> to your 5k
[2023-01-07 06:41:35] <%Brophdog88> think it puts our lost fish numbers in line though

[2023-01-07 10:27:36] <SoldSword> The Sami are just one of the few nomadic groups still around in Europe. They aren't more 'native' than the Scandinavians, for example. They just were left to themselves for most of their history.
