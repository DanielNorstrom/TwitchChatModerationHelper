[2022-12-29 10:11:12] <%+nautules> I love how people think mods can influence what happens server side. Like hitting unaimed shots... rng will still throw the shells everywhere even when 'cheating'

[2022-12-29 10:11:25] <@^Nightbot> If you want to do a tank request, stats check, field mods check by donating the minimum amount of 5‚Ç¨. New subs or resubs have the benefit of one free tank request/stats check with their sub/resub message, provided that Orza has that tank in garage. On special days you can request a tank with 500 copper by typing !redeem tank followed by the tank name.

He is a melee-ranged splash damage troop with very high hitpoints and moderate splash damage. He appears with black spiked fists and huge armor, along with grey chainmail and a team-colored belt. When deployed, he will deal damage around enemy units around him in a 360¬∫ area around him, which deals 160% the amount of damage as his regular attack.
