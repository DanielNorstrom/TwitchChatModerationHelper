[2023-01-11 01:06:58] <domball99> @bumshico Abby was only forced as we needed context for Joel’s death and the consequences of the ending of the 1st game

[2023-01-11 01:09:11] <Go0sebox> It reminded people Joel was no hero.
[2023-01-11 01:09:30] <Go0sebox> and nobody likes the truuuth
[2023-01-11 01:09:40] <domball99> personally think this would be perfect as a 3rd game, part 2 should’ve been the build up to everything
[2023-01-11 01:09:41] <%jester1256hd> yes
[2023-01-11 01:09:44] <%th3manag3r_hd> it's similar with Uncharted, people liked 4 alot more because of the main character

[2023-01-11 01:12:31] <+Liam_BM> @th3manag3r_hd they lean more on story telling than gameplay. Some people prefer this, some don't

Mother Love Bone woulda got way bigger than most of them perhaps but Andrew Wood was the 1st to go sadly. Then others later down the road. Check out Sweet Water sometime if you haven't ever heard of them. Lead singer was close to dying but got his shit together and is still around thankfully. Amazing 1st cd release back in the day

[2023-01-11 03:47:42] <kritacul> But at that same notion Joel was good in his own right.
[2023-01-11 03:47:52] <freechoerry> theyre all bad and they're all good
[2023-01-11 03:47:55] <%Alshaikh87> she wanted her dad to kill ellie they are not good people abdulLUL

[2023-01-11 03:50:09] <%Alshaikh87> the dogs are propaganda tools to force the story of abby
[2023-01-11 03:50:48] <%Alshaikh87> @domball99 people refuse to hear that because they want joel to be bad
[2023-01-11 03:50:52] <@%+BiggusMadicus> lotsa dirty stinky love making in the zombie filled appocalypse I'd imagine, reminder to invest in wet wipes
[2023-01-11 03:50:58] <TheWolfTank> @alshaikh87 ya casual gamers can't see past that they are blind by the dogs
