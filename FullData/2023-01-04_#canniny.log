[2023-01-04 17:41:46] <%rezaildivision> @MBeltran I did engineering.
[2023-01-04 17:41:52] <%rezaildivision> We had to write books
[2023-01-04 17:41:58] <%rezaildivision> Even technical manuals
[2023-01-04 17:42:38] <%yes_i_am_kazuma_0> cniHmm  THICK
[2023-01-04 17:42:38] <MBeltran> @rezaildivision i focused more on hands-on work to avoid this LOL. I do some technical writing and stuff but its not as bad since its concise and straight to the point
[2023-01-04 17:43:03] <%rezaildivision> Everything I work on with my hands I have to write it down.
