[2023-01-09 12:36:52] <Keshgar> have you tried putting pressure on Frost DKs? Make them use the burn on minions.

[2023-01-09 12:37:50] <%misterloshok> You can’t pressure w priest only cope
[2023-01-09 12:38:09] <SoEmpty322> now he will pressure with tempo 6/6
[2023-01-09 12:38:12] <%+Brinzy> I'm trying to figure out what a lack of pressure has to do with AFK game design. What is priest supposed to play to not die to that hand
[2023-01-09 12:38:25] <SoEmpty322> @Brinzy priest cards are dogshit
[2023-01-09 12:38:26] <ForTheTrees> idk, that aggro deck that loses to just about everything puts a lot of pressure on people OpieOP
[2023-01-09 12:38:43] <Keshgar> 6/6 for 6 on turn 6 KEKWait
[2023-01-09 12:38:44] <yoavsnake> @Keshgar they got it right with stuff that goes both to face and minions, and then printed brand

[2023-01-09 12:40:26] <%+Brinzy> idk I just think it's not that much of a stretch to say the game has a ton of poor design
[2023-01-09 12:40:33] <Keshgar> Remember when 7/7 for 7 with two bombs was the pinnacle of tempo? Kappa

[2023-01-09 14:31:25] <%+Brinzy> @Brinzy I mean sometimes, some cards become problematic well after their release because of the way the game has evolved
[2023-01-09 14:31:42] <%+Lurkio79> ive always hated the mechanic which allows powerful battlecries to be repeated (see Brann etc). i wouldnt be crying if they HOF'd it

[2023-01-09 14:31:47] <SoEmpty322> it should not be useless

[2023-01-09 14:34:46] <~%Zetalot> zetaVoidium this is fun
[2023-01-09 14:34:51] <%+Brinzy> Is the meta fine? almost every deck is enormous damage from hand well before turn 10
[2023-01-09 14:35:03] <@%PepegaSensei> Meta is toxic
[2023-01-09 14:35:03] <%+Brinzy> at least from the streams I'm watching
[2023-01-09 14:35:03] <%kaiserwroth> gnoll is just a small part of the overall mana cheat problem
[2023-01-09 14:35:05] <$tidolar> i don't see why turn 10 is special
[2023-01-09 14:35:11] <+W_clooney1> @Brinzy Meta is fine COPIUM
[2023-01-09 14:35:12] <Urkoth> There are people who are forced to play this game KEKL
[2023-01-09 14:35:13] <@%Shellsman> zetaVoidium  great meta
[2023-01-09 14:35:23] <ForTheTrees> who cares if the meta is fine as long as people continue to buy packs to support it
[2023-01-09 14:35:24] <functionlb> meta a bit slow but okay

[2023-01-09 14:35:40] <$tidolar> you can say you want the game to be slower, totally valid, but to say the meta is in a "bad place" implies an objective negative quality which is unwarranted
[2023-01-09 14:35:41] <gaitsith1> @Zetalot is demolition renovator worth including?

[2023-01-09 14:36:39] <%+Brinzy> @tidolar I was under the impression that everyone was speaking their opinion and not trying to say they were HS gurus. My opinion is these decks that combo kill you early are way worse than other metas
[2023-01-09 14:36:42] <%+Lurkio79> which is often the case right now
[2023-01-09 14:36:53] <@%PepegaSensei> @Urkoth Less broken, and so many bots to farm EZ Clap

[2023-01-09 14:36:59] <$tidolar> @Lurkio79 if top players can remain at the top consistently for long periods, that is an extremely good indicator that the game is more skill- than luck-based and therefore decisions matter
[2023-01-09 14:37:25] <%+Brinzy> Top players play decks just like we're complaining about because they're the best. idk what your point is

[2023-01-09 14:38:32] <simon88> KEKge
[2023-01-09 14:38:50] <SoEmpty322> people will always complain about meta because no particular meta is something everyone likes

[2023-01-09 14:39:08] <SoEmpty322> I try to find decks I like every meta, and 9/10 times I can
[2023-01-09 14:39:16] <@%Shellsman> @tidolar 4 mana 7/7 used to be a problem back in the day though - and now on turn 3 i've killed an opponent with an 8/8 windfury minion
[2023-01-09 14:39:17] <%+Brinzy> Then let me be clear in saying that, I started my entire opinion saying that this game's been poor for years
[2023-01-09 14:39:18] <$tidolar> @Brinzy my point is that if you say that a meta is healthy when "decisions" matter, you should find a way to evaluate if decisions matter. the fact that some people stay at the top indicates that decisions matter. if decisions didn't matter, you would see a large assortment of random lucky people at the top.
[2023-01-09 14:39:22] <papabless666> i like this meta YEP i play rogue btw :)

[2023-01-09 14:40:44] <$tidolar> @Brinzy okay, totally valid, but then i question why continue to play/watch/bitch about it 🤷 the motivation seems strange to me
[2023-01-09 14:41:01] <%+Brinzy> @Brinzy I get your opinion, but I think lurkio's point was that there are a lot of games where it doesn't matter what you do because you've already lost as soon as the match happened. I don't think their point had anything to do with top players and climbing
[2023-01-09 14:41:18] <$tidolar> @SoEmpty322 i see your point here, but it's not just that there are some negative responses, but that there are no positive responses. it's usually a wall of KEKW and shit
[2023-01-09 14:41:52] <%+Brinzy> @Brinzy 'cause I like zeta and other HS streamers as people and check in on their streams. The game can be entertaining to watch, but it can also be annoying. Is that really so strange?
[2023-01-09 14:42:12] <+spidy85x> wtf is the rogue doing LUL
[2023-01-09 14:42:13] <simon88> why didnt he kill the 1/4
[2023-01-09 14:42:17] <$tidolar> @Brinzy my point is that that isn't true and that decisions inside the game do matter for the reasons i gave above.
[2023-01-09 14:42:20] <SoEmpty322> vocal majority is not known to be positive lol

[2023-01-09 14:46:48] <$tidolar> i'd also be very interested to know to what extent the existence of a two-deck meta is a result of people continuing to whine about other cards being OP until blizz nerfs them
[2023-01-09 14:46:51] <functionlb> that's true of most decks though
[2023-01-09 14:46:54] <$tidolar> but that's a long separate conversation
[2023-01-09 14:47:13] <%thunderstone3> they nerfed rogue and its still the best
[2023-01-09 14:47:21] <@%PepegaSensei> @SoEmpty322 Deck is so strong even low skill players will win against better players not playing DH or rogue

[2023-01-09 14:52:59] <%namebannedmeelmo> here comes the asstalor ResidentSleeper
[2023-01-09 14:53:02] <$tidolar> @ChananR that wasn't the reason at all, it was because certain tempo players hate longer match-ups and got sick of their tempo/short-combo decks not working well enough, and then a bunch of people tweeted about it
[2023-01-09 14:53:22] <addy_hs> now big minions gone...switch to astalor scams

[2023-01-09 14:54:40] <$tidolar> @ChananR twitter and reddit YEP but it's not really game design advice, it's that they are more interested in having a popular game than a well-balanced one. which is valid, but then people shouldn't complain these things as balance problems so much as fun problems
[2023-01-09 14:54:48] <%+Lurkio79> what does our priest overlord think about the meta @Zetalot PAUSERS
