[2023-01-01 17:45:21] <%+Pughy30> I don't like how open the pitch is on PS4, it feels more loose and fast paced
[2023-01-01 17:45:22] <+ahmadchess_2008> im on ps5 why would u play ps4
[2023-01-01 17:45:22] <+FUTJDH> I think its because of how it looks is massive difference

[2023-01-01 17:45:26] <+DavyeBee24> Gameplay on ps4 version 100 times better then new gen
[2023-01-01 17:45:26] <inhousechef> im still on ps3 but its really underrated
[2023-01-01 17:45:27] <%+bongyyyyy> I get sick off hearing you reply to people asking it ahahah

[2023-01-01 17:45:32] <+capnharsha> you enjoying the old gen? im on ps4 too
[2023-01-01 17:45:40] <+sheepshaggerxx> @rileyth05 @benjaminrm01 yes the gameplay is quicker on ps4 but just treat it as a different game? Gameplay on fifa 17 is better but no one plays that anymore?
[2023-01-01 17:45:41] <colbydavis291018> Nep do you think Lloris should leave Tottenham
[2023-01-01 17:45:42] <c0normurphy> agreed!
[2023-01-01 17:45:47] <trashboat35> Have you considered playing on PC?
[2023-01-01 17:45:48] <yungmaseyy> Maybe make a short on YouTube explaining why you don‚Äôt play on new gen? Just an idea to maybe lessen the amount of people who come into the stream and ask
[2023-01-01 17:45:49] <Mr_Arneg> well, I legit play ps4 because √é don't have a ng console LUL

[2023-01-01 17:45:51] <%+nessiemad13> I prefer old gen to new, game looks nicer imo and plays better
[2023-01-01 17:45:51] <colbydavis291018> Can‚Äôt you go on the ps4 version

[2023-01-01 17:45:56] <%+nickblandmcfc> on ps4 player can actually turn
[2023-01-01 17:45:57] <FraudGang> I'm still playing on my ps4 from 2014, defo my best entertainment/service purchase of my life

[2023-01-01 17:46:09] <%+shaqhinds03> I like the ps5 version but that‚Äôs just me
[2023-01-01 17:46:10] <+DavyeBee24> Its the same as 2k, old gen is way better and smoother
[2023-01-01 17:46:13] <wizkid_205> Maybe in Europe but in NA next gen is better IMO
[2023-01-01 17:46:16] <%mickyf19> i thought the stream stopped then LUL
[2023-01-01 17:46:16] <+percy2104> I thought ps4 was better last year

[2023-01-01 18:32:49] <+tinybean92> That‚Äôs good though for new players entering the cycle late isn‚Äôt it. Pros and cons I guess
[2023-01-01 18:32:50] <%+Rhysmead1> The 95% team is easy to get too within a day or two of minimal effort gone are the days of fut when it took months of grinding to get there
[2023-01-01 18:32:59] <supermercadotelebancos> It‚Äôs like you said. When you play without pressure, you can compete!
[2023-01-01 18:33:03] <NBF_82> Does it not prove that the individuals skill at the game matters the most? Team really helps when you play someone of a similar level
[2023-01-01 18:33:04] <+Lennnnnnnnnn> Just not worth putting yourself through the stress of getting to 14
[2023-01-01 18:33:11] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> The problem I see is that they could make it harder which people would hate, they could give you more games which people would hate or they could make team count for way more which people would hate. It‚Äôs kind of catch 22

[2023-01-01 18:33:20] <+alphvgam3r> i got 16 wins this week, its ez cuz everyone got free weekend entries this week, u can do it aswell nep
[2023-01-01 18:33:21] <+Aaron_McD9> Can you turn the way it zooms in when you‚Äôre power shooting off?
[2023-01-01 18:33:23] <Stranglehold_2> is chemistry or good players matter more?
[2023-01-01 18:33:29] <%+deathskamikaze> its easier to get a sick team now its deember and theres lots to do, not day 1 though, thats what puts me off an rtg. forst few weeks is pain
[2023-01-01 18:33:35] <freysi123> why not give away 5 wins and then clutch 2 wins? Saves time
[2023-01-01 18:33:36] <ando1977> RTG is about the journey/grind more than wins these days.
[2023-01-01 18:33:47] <+fut22beta> Record?
[2023-01-01 18:33:58] <$SteIngham> @Aaron_McD9 yes u can

[2023-01-01 18:34:39] <prann06> but the flip side is you're using players you dont really enjoy. part of the experience in fifa is using your favourite players and growing attachment to new players (i.e lacazettes sbc a few years ago).. I guess that's why the full grind RTG is always more fulfilling

[2023-01-01 18:34:53] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> I do think you should play all 20 though. It would be great for comparing across different speed runs. Doesn‚Äôt really matter if you hit 11 or 14 just compare them
[2023-01-01 18:34:57] <lior636> no swaps program for fut centuriens and toty right? so 1 month away minimum from another swaps program?
[2023-01-01 18:35:01] <+thebestowen90> have they said what there going to do with totws yet ?
[2023-01-01 18:35:08] <memequeen_ellie> @nepenthez do u believe with these players you could do it on next gen
[2023-01-01 18:36:08] <inhousechef> why quit
[2023-01-01 18:36:08] <inhousechef> instead of play

[2023-01-01 18:36:20] <inhousechef> but you could come back 4-3 it happens all the time
[2023-01-01 18:36:20] <hujacalin> How do you enable to see the opponent squad?
[2023-01-01 18:36:20] <%+whltemagnum> hi nep, Smithy9996 gifted me a sub yesterday but I didn't even realise, thanks to him
[2023-01-01 18:36:22] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> Hmm. Then maybe you‚Äôre right for future vids to not have the champs part.
[2023-01-01 18:36:23] <%+Rebzy__voxz> waiting for the free token at 1 and i get my last 2 draft wins

[2023-01-01 18:36:57] <+sunbaes> that card is too broken
[2023-01-01 18:36:58] <JammieDodge191> @Rebzy__voxz impossible
[2023-01-01 18:37:01] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> @rebzy__voxz that is genuinely impossible
[2023-01-01 18:37:09] <%+shivach00> @Rebzy__voxz same, got two rare gold packs twice for winning the final
[2023-01-01 18:37:10] <killamanshanks> I don‚Äôt blame you for leaving at 2-0. I do that too when you just know the opponent either is extremely good or just an insane team you can‚Äôt compete
[2023-01-01 18:37:22] <+sunbaes> seems to get more jammy than any other card ive played against
[2023-01-01 18:37:23] <ando1977> The amount of people with prime R9 compared to previous years is amazing. More than half of this weekend League opponents had him

[2023-01-01 18:38:05] <%+Kieran96cfc> you 100% make profit from every draft final
[2023-01-01 18:38:07] <haockeydfb> Di maria is a goat freekick taker, scores everytime for me
[2023-01-01 18:38:09] <%ntblue1034> or they're an idiot
[2023-01-01 18:38:12] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> @rebzy__voxz nope. All draft win rewards at bare minimum give you 15k back plus 4 matches worth of match coins
[2023-01-01 18:38:18] <+JackasaurusTV> 3 and a bit bars of power should be enough for a free kick like that
[2023-01-01 18:38:24] <speiirsy> does single player draft count towards the OBJ ? I assume so ?
[2023-01-01 18:38:29] <%+Kieran96cfc> You make 2k from match coins so only need 13k from packs
[2023-01-01 18:38:31] <%+Rebzy__voxz> no walkouts , no lib cards or eredive cards with any value
[2023-01-01 18:38:40] <+TacoCorpWHQ> This Payet WW card has to be my favourite card for ages. Actually got me enjoying player for the first time in forever!

[2023-01-01 19:04:22] <Isshhhyy786> stray stoeng brothers. they want you to stagnate on jarzinho.
[2023-01-01 19:04:22] <+ethan260705> Should‚Äôve made it Base or mid Dont you think
[2023-01-01 19:04:23] <MarioBr0ther> my theory is that the winter wildcards sbc's are so mid because EA knows people have a ton of fodder right now, and so they don't want to release anything good as it would allow loads of people to get good players for next to nothing
[2023-01-01 19:04:23] <Makezuu1> Bellegarde is better than base icon
[2023-01-01 19:04:23] <LootinLarry> Cheap but base icons are terrible
