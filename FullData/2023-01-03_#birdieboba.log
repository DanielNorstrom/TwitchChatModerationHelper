[2023-01-03 09:58:47] <%legionoftruth> @cheshiressmile Have a goodnight. birdiebBirbpat
[2023-01-03 09:58:58] <%legionoftruth> So chat, you Gender-bend for a day, but you have to experience one bad thing specifically with the other gender, would you press the botton?
[2023-01-03 09:59:06] <%$Maxotica> what does that mean a bad thing
[2023-01-03 09:59:06] <verajonson> well if i could gender bend to be a female i would be ok with it but having to experience one bad thing could i PICK the bad thing?
[2023-01-03 09:59:21] <%legionoftruth> @verajonson Sure.
[2023-01-03 09:59:25] <!%snpdrag0n> No you don't
[2023-01-03 09:59:28] <iszabael> i would smash that button
[2023-01-03 09:59:29] <+Doomtroopa> LOL

[2023-01-03 09:59:33] <%Godofwar547> oh i did that once
[2023-01-03 09:59:35] <%$Maxotica> I need to know what hurts more getting kicked or child birth so I can settle the argument
[2023-01-03 09:59:35] <Mr_Grim1> need to know what?
[2023-01-03 09:59:37] <%lostonessouls> No..No you don't
[2023-01-03 09:59:38] VIEWERS: 282
[2023-01-03 09:59:39] <verajonson> NO no no you don't want to experience it
[2023-01-03 09:59:40] <RadioSpirit> It's the same as any other direct never pain
[2023-01-03 09:59:42] <verajonson> IT HURTS
[2023-01-03 09:59:48] <%thefriendlyghostyy> I must know this as well
[2023-01-03 09:59:55] <CrimsonVariety> it personally feels like a sucker punch straight to the lungs
[2023-01-03 09:59:55] <RadioSpirit> nerve**
[2023-01-03 09:59:59] <%$Maxotica> you know it doesn't, have u seen men when they are sick?

[2023-01-03 10:00:02] <ZanshlouCarmina> The general comparison I hear is that getting hit in the balls is similar to being punched in the boob
[2023-01-03 10:00:06] <stereo_saiyan> everyone feels pain differently atmShrug
[2023-01-03 10:00:07] <%thefriendlyghostyy> birdiebCthulhu
[2023-01-03 10:00:11] <bread_mmm> um it’s like a sharp pain that stays for like 5 mins and leaves gradually hugmnsEhe
[2023-01-03 10:00:14] <%cmdr_zelphion> sounds like the start of a bad comedy skit... "Y'know? What's the deal with Cock and Ball Torture anyway?"
[2023-01-03 10:00:18] <%+kami_no_karite> Lol. No cock and ball torture. It can be extremely painful. Some like to get a football punt to the sack
[2023-01-03 10:00:23] <verajonson> i mean ok but trust me it is PAINFUL
[2023-01-03 10:00:25] <HellHoundWoman> Heyyy birdieee
[2023-01-03 10:00:26] <%Godofwar547> @BirdieBoba just leting you know it feels like iron in a grinder type pain
[2023-01-03 10:00:37] <Mr_Grim1> i can just say, i like pain, but man not that kind of pain ... whip me, slap me, punch me if you will, but please leave my poor jewels alone T_T
[2023-01-03 10:00:39] <RadioSpirit> I'd do the womens cramps device
[2023-01-03 10:00:43] <%thefriendlyghostyy> I heard them say it’s a stomach pain too lol
[2023-01-03 10:00:53] <Nirrri117> Honestly? Same. I’d like to know how a hit to the balls feels so that I will never compare the pain again lol
[2023-01-03 10:00:55] <RadioSpirit> But pain and I have an odd relationship
[2023-01-03 10:01:02] <!%snpdrag0n> Its cause many people I know to get sick

[2023-01-03 10:01:26] <%$Maxotica> didnt they come out and say the man in the canoe is more sensitive then a man's equipment
[2023-01-03 10:01:27] <%+kami_no_karite> If you hit a guys in the nuts and punch them in the throat, the pain can kill them.
[2023-01-03 10:01:29] <HellHoundWoman> I heard getting kicked in the balls- what did I walk into
[2023-01-03 10:01:30] <Mr_Grim1> the pain from balls is like choking and puking at the same time and then passing out
[2023-01-03 10:01:31] <!%snpdrag0n> Period pain is cruel too Sadge
[2023-01-03 10:01:31] <verajonson> honestly i'd rather gender bend to be a female IF i could feel what being pregnant is like BUT  if i could wear sexy and cute dresses
[2023-01-03 10:01:38] VIEWERS: 282
[2023-01-03 10:01:49] <%+kami_no_karite> Yeah it can stop the heart.
[2023-01-03 10:01:59] <+D_O_G_0> You can kick me In the balls of I get a hug after
[2023-01-03 10:02:02] <bread_mmm> i mean i was kicked in the balls so much that i don’t feel anything anymore LUL
[2023-01-03 10:02:07] <%Taii017> I've been punched, kicked, got leg cramps, migraines, bitten, scratched, tackled, munched on, knee'd, elbowed, funny-boned but ball-pain is the worst.
[2023-01-03 10:02:09] <%$Maxotica> can I ask why getting tapped on the nuts hurts but slamming them around during fun time doesnt
[2023-01-03 10:02:13] <%Uggmcmuffin> ill trade ya
[2023-01-03 10:02:19] <Mr_Grim1> unless 👀
[2023-01-03 10:02:23] <%OctoMuffin> Ummm
[2023-01-03 10:02:28] <+D_O_G_0> I have a brother
[2023-01-03 10:02:28] <ZoOlja> think of the worst cramp you ever had, now 10x that
[2023-01-03 10:02:31] <%+kami_no_karite> Last time I was hit that hard, the pain in the stomach was unbearable and it lasted for a week.
[2023-01-03 10:02:33] <%cmdr_zelphion> sure! I'm not using them tomorrow I don't think birdiebZoom
[2023-01-03 10:02:34] <%ZeroTheRedHead> think eye poke sentive with stumic punched
[2023-01-03 10:02:34] <+D_O_G_0> We go for the balls
[2023-01-03 10:02:34] <%thefriendlyghostyy> I’ve always wondered how guys walk around without hurting somehow
[2023-01-03 10:02:39] <HellHoundWoman> I remember my first relationship- he tried to fucking jump onto a table but he accidently got himself in the balls XD so stupid lmao
[2023-01-03 10:02:51] <%ShaiPie_> Some of the worst pain I've experienced has been from IBS.
