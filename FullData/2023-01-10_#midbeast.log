[2023-01-10 13:23:03] <gusky651> Hello midbeast. I've noticed your title says "RUSH RANK 1 NOW", but you are not rushing rank 1 now. Please clarify.
[2023-01-10 13:23:04] <LeeamStevenz> look up on the internet where geography can take you... there are heaps of avenues you can pick
[2023-01-10 13:23:04] <playingmyroles> you remind me of a friend we font speak anymore with :(
[2023-01-10 13:23:08] <imstelllar> big words with no meaning

[2023-01-10 13:23:11] <NPCThree> my dream is to be a world class criminal
[2023-01-10 13:23:12] <xtender90> @octoflutsch I did 1 year Geogrphy, no jobs and switched to Psychology, still hard to find jobs. Now I.m finishing Computer Science. If you rly like it go for it, but bare in mind, jobs in this field are rly limited.
[2023-01-10 13:23:15] <looper2121> Geography is not only maps it is the understanding of the soil as well. You could probably land a job within construction
