[2022-12-06 10:16:42] <%+KawaXIV> i like OBS replay buffer
[2022-12-06 10:16:46] <%Fryden_> depends how long you want to clip to be
[2022-12-06 10:16:52] <%+KawaXIV> and if you use nvenc renderer its like same hardware encoder as shadowplay
[2022-12-06 10:16:56] <%+KawaXIV> yeah it grabs all the sources
[2022-12-06 10:17:03] <%HalCynical> can u put padarou on ur head

[2022-12-06 10:17:07] <%+KawaXIV> i still like it cause i dont like to install the geforce experience + the shadowplay thing
[2022-12-06 10:17:21] <%PsyFi_ZA> Shadowplay can capture your game for like 30 seconds and you can bind it to your stream deck
[2022-12-06 10:17:27] <%+KawaXIV> yeah you have to enable replay buffer in the same place where you do stream/record encoder settings
[2022-12-06 10:17:32] <%+KawaXIV> and then you have to set up a hotkey
[2022-12-06 10:17:38] <%+KawaXIV> in OBS since there isnt one by default
[2022-12-06 10:17:42] <%PsyFi_ZA> yeah and you can adjust the time
[2022-12-06 10:17:47] <%Fryden_> Yeah you can change it too. Shortest is 15 sec
[2022-12-06 10:17:52] <%+KawaXIV> the replay buffer clip will be a video file saved in the same place as any videos you get by using the OBS recording function
[2022-12-06 10:18:00] <%+KawaXIV> you set the length yourself
[2022-12-06 10:18:04] <%+KawaXIV> i use 90s for mine
[2022-12-06 10:18:06] <%PsyFi_ZA> need that elgato foot pedal now KEKW
[2022-12-06 10:18:11] <%+KawaXIV> there's like a box where you can enter the length in seconds
[2022-12-06 10:18:19] <%Fryden_> Longest is 20 minutes
[2022-12-06 10:18:35] <pyrix0> I remember being in here back in the day...god it feels so long ago ;-;
[2022-12-06 10:18:51] <%PsyFi_ZA> jusy buy the foot pedal for prog LUL
[2022-12-06 10:18:51] <%+KawaXIV> oh i think replay buffer will match your "Recording" settings under Output
[2022-12-06 10:18:54] <%Fryden_> You can also change the bitrate of the clip so it doesn't completely soak up space
[2022-12-06 10:19:03] VIEWERS: 379
[2022-12-06 10:19:04] <+MezameTV> i misread that as Glasya Legolas
[2022-12-06 10:19:06] <%+KawaXIV> so you just go into the Settings -> Output -> Replay buffer, tick the box, set the time, and set up a hotkey that's it
[2022-12-06 10:19:20] <%+KawaXIV> oh and you have to start replay buffer button underneath the start streaming and start recording buttons before itll work too
[2022-12-06 10:19:24] <pyrix0> I still feel like old content should have a bit lower ilevels so that they weren't so easily steam rolled...
[2022-12-06 10:19:34] <%+KawaXIV> personally i find it has no impact on how my pc runs the game or w/e to use it so im very happy with it

[2022-12-06 10:21:52] <%+KawaXIV> once you check that youll have a start and stop replay buffer button under your Start Streaming button on the OBS main window
[2022-12-06 10:21:58] <%+KawaXIV> so you dont have to use automatically start replay buffer thing
[2022-12-06 10:22:22] <%+KawaXIV> yeah under the hotkeys window look for "Save Replay"
[2022-12-06 10:22:26] <%+KawaXIV> in the list
[2022-12-06 10:22:53] <%+KawaXIV> in OBS but i guess youre just looking for a button that's free right now by checking the game?
[2022-12-06 10:22:57] <%+KawaXIV> you should only need 1 button
[2022-12-06 10:23:03] VIEWERS: 369
[2022-12-06 10:23:09] <%+KawaXIV> just start the replay buffer when you start raiding and leave it on, and use "Save Replay" hotkey
[2022-12-06 10:23:14] <%+KawaXIV> it grabs the past X seconds when you press it
[2022-12-06 10:23:23] <%JustAOrangeWall> numpad masterrrace
[2022-12-06 10:23:28] <%+KawaXIV> where X is the number you set in Settings -> Output -> Replay Buffer tab
[2022-12-06 10:23:29] <%+KawaXIV> yeah
[2022-12-06 10:23:47] <%+KawaXIV> yeah Start Replay Buffer on the main obs window
[2022-12-06 10:23:54] <%+KawaXIV> and then you wipe and youre like wtf where was i standing
[2022-12-06 10:23:57] <%+KawaXIV> hit hotkey and check the file :)
[2022-12-06 10:24:12] <%+KawaXIV> OBS won't pop the clip open for you or anything though so itll be in your default videos folder or w/e obs saves recordings
[2022-12-06 10:24:30] <%+KawaXIV> folder in your Settings -> Output -> Recording in case you cant find the file

[2022-12-06 10:25:46] <%+KawaXIV> at the top of the hotkeys window is there a box that says Filter
[2022-12-06 10:25:53] <%+KawaXIV> you can type "Save Replay" in there to find the bind

[2022-12-06 10:30:01] <%+KawaXIV> bottom of main OBS window should spit out some text about replay buffer saved when you press the save hotkey
[2022-12-06 10:30:05] <%+KawaXIV> hmm...
[2022-12-06 10:30:23] <%JustAOrangeWall> wait under hotkey no "Start Replay Buffer*" ?
[2022-12-06 10:30:27] <%+KawaXIV> and Enable Replay Buffer is checked under Output -> Replay buffer right?
[2022-12-06 10:30:33] <%+KawaXIV> @JustAOrangeWall not necessary to bind that one
[2022-12-06 10:30:38] <%+KawaXIV> its the same as the button on main obs window
[2022-12-06 10:30:51] <%+KawaXIV> i have a theory im test something rq
[2022-12-06 10:31:03] VIEWERS: 361
[2022-12-06 10:31:24] <%+KawaXIV> yeah my best guess is that OBS might not be able to let you have the button activate-able while you're mid-streaming right now
[2022-12-06 10:31:32] <%+KawaXIV> ohhhhhh
[2022-12-06 10:31:36] <%+KawaXIV> separate recording settings might be necessary
[2022-12-06 10:31:42] <%+KawaXIV> are you using recording -> use stream encoder
[2022-12-06 10:31:45] <%+KawaXIV> that could be the problem
[2022-12-06 10:31:56] <%+KawaXIV> you're sooooo close though so just check that out after stream and i think youll be all set
