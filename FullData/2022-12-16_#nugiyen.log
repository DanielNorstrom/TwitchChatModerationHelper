[2022-12-16 13:04:52] <SollSmottoh> speaking of inefficient. I think I want to do a build I'm almost certain won't work very well, but I think I'm going to see how far I can push it. Turong spectres using ignite. As far as I'm aware Turong (the big blue fireball dogs from delve) are the only spectres with a spell that does +150% more ignite damage

[2022-12-16 22:18:00] <icek17cz> build diversity is actually huge this league
[2022-12-16 22:18:03] <Foortsatak> especially because of this league also
[2022-12-16 22:18:05] <icek17cz> what do you mean, it is
[2022-12-16 22:18:11] <Foortsatak> league mechanic
[2022-12-16 22:18:14] <%+meer92> Did you change the cup? @nugiyen
[2022-12-16 22:18:31] <Foortsatak> it really isn't guys
[2022-12-16 22:18:32] <Foortsatak> wtf
[2022-12-16 22:18:39] <+Headskull3> and if you wanna play league mechanic, have fun finding something that does not feel shit
[2022-12-16 22:18:39] <Foortsatak> compared to the harvest days
[2022-12-16 22:18:52] <Lifesigns> there are too many defensive things to check off the list. really limits what you can do
[2022-12-16 22:18:53] <%+meer92> The cold iron point I meant @nugiyen
[2022-12-16 22:18:54] <Foortsatak> the game got a lot harder
[2022-12-16 22:18:56] <icek17cz> i dont, and i still take my state,  do cold BV with supression, 20k armour, flat phys reducton, avoid ailments...
[2022-12-16 22:18:57] <Foortsatak> and crafting is harder
[2022-12-16 22:19:00] <Foortsatak> gearing*
[2022-12-16 22:19:04] <icek17cz> you can do that on any build this league
[2022-12-16 22:19:12] <Foortsatak> even with archnemesis nerfed the game is a lot harder
[2022-12-16 22:19:46] <Foortsatak> it all depends on what you wanna do
[2022-12-16 22:19:50] VIEWERS: 741
[2022-12-16 22:19:57] <Foortsatak> but pinnacle bosses viable
[2022-12-16 22:20:00] <Foortsatak> very few builds can do that
[2022-12-16 22:20:16] <Foortsatak> 8 mods t16 maps
[2022-12-16 22:20:20] <Foortsatak> very few builds

[2022-12-16 22:20:53] <Foortsatak> omg
[2022-12-16 22:20:58] <Foortsatak> i have the grace/determination requirement
[2022-12-16 22:21:04] <Foortsatak> agree!!
[2022-12-16 22:21:09] <icek17cz> then i dont understand what do you mean, there are no other defenses...
[2022-12-16 22:21:10] <Foortsatak> it's so lame
[2022-12-16 22:21:20] <BalderSideSwag> i think the biggest offender are determination , molten shell, and spell suppression
[2022-12-16 22:21:34] <Foortsatak> @icek17cz but the thing is determination is required on every build
[2022-12-16 22:21:36] <Foortsatak> which makes it boring
[2022-12-16 22:21:50] VIEWERS: 741
[2022-12-16 22:22:02] <Foortsatak> @BalderSideSwag jup
[2022-12-16 22:22:12] <+fridim94> i think the probleme is that every build that can not do ubers is shit now
[2022-12-16 22:22:21] <%+Nannniii> @icek17cz before you would go block or armor or evasion or curses, etc now you need it all which limit build a lot
[2022-12-16 22:22:30] <Foortsatak> @fridim94 you can still have fun with it ofc
[2022-12-16 22:22:40] <icek17cz> @icek17cz hmm

[2022-12-16 22:23:36] <%+Nannniii> @icek17cz before you would go glad so block armor for example, raider, dodge eva, now you need armor eva spell supress ailment immune, stun immune etc it's a lot when you're ssf and don't want ot play meta skills
[2022-12-16 22:23:42] <%+ArcadiusXIV> we've had 9 months of very few changes to skill gem balance, each league we get hyped for a "Meta shake-up" and each lleague they disapoint Sadge
[2022-12-16 22:23:49] <Foortsatak> @nugiyen you need that OP triple damage staff for that :p
[2022-12-16 22:23:51] VIEWERS: 755
[2022-12-16 22:23:54] <+Headskull3> just use triple damage staff and most things probably work
[2022-12-16 22:23:55] <Foortsatak> like enki is doing with arc
[2022-12-16 22:23:56] <%+MrVonDutchman> YES. make firestorm great again Madge
[2022-12-16 22:23:57] <+Babylon7k> i did my first league start with pohx RF build... never had it so esy getting going, but damn am I a little bored already.. usually just go for some random starting shit
[2022-12-16 22:23:58] <smoczakula93> yes now u are correct, spells are relatively weak
[2022-12-16 22:23:58] <Foortsatak> which is also kinda boring

[2022-12-16 22:25:33] <Lifesigns> tbf firestorm was absolutely gutted just so ggg could save performance

[2022-12-16 22:26:16] <%+Nannniii> tha'ts what i keep saying about mathil play everything build, he;s good but he;s playing around op mecanic/item not actual skill

[2022-12-16 22:26:38] <BalderSideSwag> yeah imo  the support gem changes made the problem worse @Foortsatak
[2022-12-16 22:26:57] <SouIHunt> yep many skills are just cosmetics nowadays
[2022-12-16 22:26:58] <+fridim94> firestorm just got removed and replaced with  a different skill
[2022-12-16 22:27:09] <%Tnb87113> you also were excited they might rebalance skills now that archnem is changed :)

[2022-12-16 22:27:34] <Lifesigns> ggg has pulled as much power as they can out of gems and the skill tree and put them into items, i think it's really caused what you're talking about

[2022-12-16 22:31:18] <Foortsatak> they could buff every underused skill by 10% more damage every patch and go from there
[2022-12-16 22:31:22] <+Headskull3> next league, oh mna it's gonna be soo goood

[2022-12-16 22:31:55] <%HeffU> I do feel a bit like the requirements for a build to feel decent have increased, be that due to myself over the years, or the game, or both
[2022-12-16 22:32:13] <%HeffU> So I find myself trashing a lot more wonky builds in the planning stage, rather than rerolling and trying them
[2022-12-16 22:32:30] <SouIHunt> then you realize that your 10c budget farming build is better then your 10 mirrors fun build
[2022-12-16 22:32:33] <Foortsatak> the game is great but could be better
