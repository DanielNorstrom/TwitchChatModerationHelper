[2023-01-04 00:00:34] <alexlikesfrogs2> it‚Äôs kind of a lot
[2023-01-04 00:00:34] <@%+MrsTomato101814> ohio law used to be that you could buy fireworks as long as you promised to take them out of the state to launch them. now its a free for all though

[2023-01-04 00:01:02] <%ARomanticAce> like all fireworks are illegal in my city, but not in my state, so people just go outside the city to buy them and then bring them back into our neighborhood
[2023-01-04 00:01:03] <%+acacialea> I hate fireworks. They‚Äôre pretty, but terrifying.
[2023-01-04 00:01:06] <fenristheunlurkiestturkey> fireworks are the worst. all they do is pollute and scare animals
[2023-01-04 00:01:08] <%$LivingwithLife235> someone set off firework on the top of a parking garage in my town while me and my friends were walking up trying to find our cars and holy cow was it loud
[2023-01-04 00:01:08] <valfana> I think the window wall would look better without the tiles
[2023-01-04 00:01:08] <Perixia> first time i have come back in a while and this is the most crusty position ever
[2023-01-04 00:01:08] <%ariflew_af> i wish we banned them in california too many fires

[2023-01-04 00:01:14] <%BaileyIdol> we just moved to washington state this year and the fireworks are crazy here. My dog has had a horrible time with it, poor thing.
[2023-01-04 00:01:14] <lauren1275> in New Zealand we can only buy frieworks on 3 days a year, but we can let them off whenever
[2023-01-04 00:01:15] <%EeveeTinn> in Denmark it is from 27th of December until 1st of January. otherwise illegal. they arrested and confiscated so many people/tings
[2023-01-04 00:01:16] <notkhristian> Fireworks always test my anxiety
[2023-01-04 00:01:24] <%+95Capricorn> Our state is supposed to have like a week on either side of 4th of July and new years only for launching, but that doesn't stop people from doing it whenever they please:/
[2023-01-04 00:01:27] <anabebeca04> kinda liked the wallpaper but not in all the room

[2023-01-04 00:01:29] <lorettabelleart> oh yeah that was kinda how it was in PA/NJ, like you could buy them in one state but set them off in another? it was confusing haha
[2023-01-04 00:01:31] <%$therobinwing> someone in my appartment building was launching rockets off of their balcony
[2023-01-04 00:01:31] <%$userlameuserlame> lmao in the netherlands fireworks are crazy i hate it

[2023-01-04 00:01:33] <%$cmj0222> fireworks are illegal in nyc but folk buy them in pa
[2023-01-04 00:01:35] <+sheymb> Our state is only Fourth of July
[2023-01-04 00:01:36] <alina7516> In canada they are hard to find so I guess why ppl don't do it as much illegally
[2023-01-04 00:01:37] <MissSimly7> yeah thats confusing
[2023-01-04 00:01:37] <lauren1275> in New Zealand we can only buy frieworks on 3 days a year, but we can let them off whenever we want
[2023-01-04 00:01:37] <%ARomanticAce> i was pleased that this NYE people really only set off a few fireworks in my neighborhood and not even at midnight; they did at like 10 pm. probably the cold, but still.
[2023-01-04 00:01:38] <froggyballs101> I love the tile and counter combo it matches so well omg üò≥
[2023-01-04 00:01:41] <%Lizarrdbreath> they're banned in Colorado too because of fires üòÖüòÖ people still do them though
[2023-01-04 00:01:41] <kayterssss> we aren‚Äôt allowed in my city but all anyone gets is a stop letting them off.  Ours is banned due to the houses being close together and old

[2023-01-04 00:01:44] <%+sparkaronicus> actually funnily enough fireworks are illegal here but a theme park near us launches them nightly so we hear them at my house
[2023-01-04 00:01:44] <mrs_kulifa> Banned in ma but you drive 20 mins across the border to get them and bring them home
[2023-01-04 00:01:45] <%+rosiee_bee> We buy them a state over and then all set them off at once. I think they‚Äôre illegal in nj where I am but I don‚Äôt think most people care

[2023-01-04 00:03:49] <MissyB2010> I'm glad the firework hit me though and not the three year old boy stood next to me! despite how painful it was !
[2023-01-04 00:03:50] <%+reaganh3621> one time at my uncles house the firework tipped over and hit me. it didn't hurt that bad but now i don't like fireworks. we even had blocks around it to stabilize it
[2023-01-04 00:03:53] <MCPohato> you can move the cabinet into the wall
[2023-01-04 00:03:53] <hangaszomor_> i love the look of fireworks but people nowadays are so stupid and irresponsible that at this point fireworks should be banned for home use

[2023-01-04 00:03:59] <%+wrensamphire> I think it's 100k per night
[2023-01-04 00:03:59] <%ARomanticAce> i loved setting off fireworks when i was a kid, but i grew up in the country where we were all too far apart to hear much of each other's fireworks and also we had a great big gravel driveway to set them off in, for fire safety.
[2023-01-04 00:03:59] <bibliopaige> my aunt got hit by one of her neighbors fireworks and the neighbors weren‚Äôt punished at all

[2023-01-04 00:04:23] <%ARomanticAce> oh i'm sure it's enormous, from the number of fireworks and then all the setup and prep and permits and stuff
[2023-01-04 00:04:24] <veja1> honestly fireworks should only be allowed to use by profesionals

[2023-01-04 00:05:21] <honest_jackson> I think people should use the silent ones more, firework noises aren‚Äôt just scary for pets but for wildlife and ppl with ptsd

[2023-01-04 00:06:47] <kellya2215> what is your favourite pack
[2023-01-04 00:06:47] <%DeepestNightmare> In Disney Paris they project a lightshow on the castle, at least that's what they did 8 years ago xD
[2023-01-04 00:06:47] <mimmu_munni> simsieNom
[2023-01-04 00:06:49] <%$cheeruppirate> my cousin has worked on the lightshows at disney, won't get me in tho
[2023-01-04 00:06:49] <%+moonpearl33> I‚Äôm very anti zoo
[2023-01-04 00:06:50] <%+reykablue> Animal kingdom used to close at like 7
[2023-01-04 00:06:51] <%+ladyartful> i love animalkingdom at night pandora lights up
[2023-01-04 00:06:51] <frogsmybeloved> i wonder how non-americans see disney parks
[2023-01-04 00:06:52] <pseudoash> I only like animal kingdom and Epcot, only been to magic kingdom once
[2023-01-04 00:06:53] <+barlee89> That‚Äôs why I can‚Äôt bring myself to go to the parks. It‚Äôs criminally expensive. The mouse doesn‚Äôt need more money
[2023-01-04 00:06:53] <%ARomanticAce> yeah some of the drone shows i've seen are super cool
[2023-01-04 00:06:53] <%+fionnualla> @fionnualla Why was it cancelled?
[2023-01-04 00:06:54] <%$purply_unicorn> I‚Äôve never been to Disney always wanted to go
[2023-01-04 00:06:55] <%+louieheuy> animal kingdom is the best park
[2023-01-04 00:06:57] <%Groundhog89> plot twist. recreate animal kingdom in planet Zoo!
[2023-01-04 00:07:00] <valfana> yessss love lightshows
[2023-01-04 00:07:01] <%+wrensamphire> @fionnualla I'm sad they cancelled ROL, it was so nice
[2023-01-04 00:07:01] <too__sorry> they do do the lightshow after dark, everytime I've gone we've stayed to see it

[2023-01-04 00:07:04] <%+mrs_beastlyy> i didn‚Äôt get to enjoy animal kingdom when i went because it stormed all day :(
[2023-01-04 00:07:05] <%master_blastoise> drone shows are easier to plan for since they're programmable
[2023-01-04 00:07:07] <jillification> I‚Äôve just joined can anyone tell me what pack that wallpaper is in?
[2023-01-04 00:07:11] <Jane_Dear> ah, apologies, revision; Disney Parks doesn‚Äôt disclose the cost of all their firework shows, but just the nightly ‚ÄòDisney Enchantment‚Äô fireworks show at the Magic Kingdom costs about $25,000 a night.  Much less than ‚ÄúHappily Ever After‚Äù cost ($45,000/night) because it features a lot more castle projections, lasers, and surround lighting, including lighting down Main Street USA, than actual fireworks.
[2023-01-04 00:07:11] <@%^Moobot> Please don't fill up the entire chat, @Jane_Dear (warning)

[2023-01-04 00:07:21] <%+minleafy> never been to disney, i dont understand the hype
[2023-01-04 00:07:21] <veja1> they do laser shows in my country instead of fireworks rn, but people can still buy fireworks and use them
[2023-01-04 00:07:21] <%+louieheuy> so cool
[2023-01-04 00:07:23] <%l0lamenting> and the music too
[2023-01-04 00:07:24] <$honeyspawn> it was way crowded at animal kingdom at night when we were there years ago. but that's when pandora had just opened

[2023-01-04 00:07:37] <%+skelaceton> Both of my neighbors did fireworks at the same time on new years. Luckily the cats seemed ok though

[2023-01-04 00:11:02] <%sageternal> also we had a lil break due to the aging bug right?

[2023-01-04 00:11:03] <TinaaLeigh> i just got soo confused
[2023-01-04 00:11:07] <%endakat> Gotcha

[2023-01-04 00:11:09] <spegeterspagooter> i just watched the viewer count drop a heck of a lot omg-
[2023-01-04 00:11:10] <%+stephspotato> wait what did they do to the lifespans?
[2023-01-04 00:11:11] <+helenteds> one of the columns in the corners is missing
[2023-01-04 00:11:13] <phil_spear03> How many packs have been used in this build?
[2023-01-04 00:11:13] <%afrench1520> blue teened differently than other teens blue teened
[2023-01-04 00:11:14] <%+snowy_flake> i bought ddv over the weekend because of you!!
[2023-01-04 00:11:17] <%+lex_in_tenebris> you're missing a corner column
[2023-01-04 00:11:17] <lmaze25> When are you playing among us next?
[2023-01-04 00:11:17] <xiaomaryyu> what about vampire rug... is there a light swatch?
[2023-01-04 00:11:20] <MCPohato> @Plourde4 what baby?
[2023-01-04 00:11:27] <veja1> how much longer are they rn?
[2023-01-04 00:11:28] <@%+MrsTomato101814> @heatherlouise_ i think so! theres a lot of shows to watch and overall the attractions there are much more tame than what you would find at a local theme park or universal. theres lots of info online about the intensity of specific attractions too
[2023-01-04 00:11:28] <%mmadsi> Can sims walk there with the columns there?
[2023-01-04 00:11:32] <Gatoapestoso_> Change the carpet please simsieLasers
[2023-01-04 00:11:32] [Announcement] <Moobot> We're building a purple cottage in The Sims 4! simsieHype
[2023-01-04 00:11:34] <@%mivyard> hello
[2023-01-04 00:11:36] <%+wrensamphire> @heatherlouise_ yes it is, there's so much to do without rides. depending on your condition, there's a lot of "rides" that are more like attractions, so you're just sitting in a slow moving vehicle rather than a rollercoaster
[2023-01-04 00:11:38] <%$sharkpopsicles> Honestly the increased lifespan probably only adds up to like two more episodes.
[2023-01-04 00:11:41] <%ARomanticAce> ohhh i thought it was bc of the high school pack
[2023-01-04 00:11:41] <%GeneralXiaoLong> HELLO
[2023-01-04 00:11:42] <fenristheunlurkiestturkey> @afrench1520 LOL i ad to read this like 20 times
[2023-01-04 00:11:43] <Vip101417> when do you think the infant update is coming out
[2023-01-04 00:11:44] <+helenteds> didn't that lead to the auto aging bug
[2023-01-04 00:11:45] <%+snowy_flake> hi miv!
[2023-01-04 00:11:47] <%+stephspotato> oooooh neat! wonder if they will do that with the length of pregnancies too?
[2023-01-04 00:11:50] <%$mushfroggie> @mivyard hello person idk i'm in my merch

[2023-01-04 00:11:57] <%+95Capricorn> I just assumed that was because of high school years! I didn't know

[2023-01-04 00:11:58] <@%mivyard> @mushfroggie NICE
[2023-01-04 00:12:01] <bibliopaige> did they make the young adult lifespan a little longer too?
[2023-01-04 00:12:03] <frogsmybeloved> the aging bug?
[2023-01-04 00:12:03] <honest_jackson> People are saying that might come this week!
[2023-01-04 00:12:04] <@%mivyard> hi christine! hi everyone!
[2023-01-04 00:12:09] <%magix532> hi miv
[2023-01-04 00:12:09] <anabebeca04> did they said when Infance update is going out?
[2023-01-04 00:12:10] <%pugmomma93> I thought it was for longer time for teens and school
[2023-01-04 00:12:15] <yeastess> infants is exciting but I really wish they made teenagers look like teenagers instead
[2023-01-04 00:12:15] <MCPohato> @Plourde4 ah, thanks
[2023-01-04 00:12:15] <%+skelaceton> Did they say when infants are coming?
[2023-01-04 00:12:19] <%$mushfroggie> who is this smivyerd?
[2023-01-04 00:12:20] <%heatherlouise_> @mrstomato101814 That‚Äôs good to know, I‚Äôd still love to go at least once! Thanks simsieLove
[2023-01-04 00:12:24] <%+snowy_flake> its all coming together simsieThink
[2023-01-04 00:12:27] <MissComputer> @skelaceton Early 2023 :D
[2023-01-04 00:12:30] <%+wrensamphire> @anabebeca04 no news since they announced early 2023... so within the next few months
[2023-01-04 00:12:30] <%$mistikfic> we should have figured it out
[2023-01-04 00:12:31] <didarshaz123> @skelaceton early 2023
[2023-01-04 00:12:32] <%ziggylagoon> If they dont add more interactions for object babies I have no more hope
[2023-01-04 00:12:32] <%+sparkaronicus> lmaoo everything makes sense now
[2023-01-04 00:12:33] <@%+MrsTomato101814> tbh i think the age spans are too long for almost all groups now
[2023-01-04 00:12:34] <Vip101417> when do you think the infant update is coming out?
[2023-01-04 00:12:34] <sarah_salade> I gtg now this was a fun first ever live to watch. Succes with the rest of the build bye!!
[2023-01-04 00:12:38] <TheWeenieStanley> love the cat can
[2023-01-04 00:12:38] <Baby_Tsuki> How do I size the items? Like the rug
[2023-01-04 00:12:38] <%sageternal> at the same time im so terrified yet so excited for the infants
[2023-01-04 00:12:39] <lmaze25> When are you playing among us next?

[2023-01-04 00:12:51] <%+meeksity> Remember when we thought they just wanted to let the teenagers have more time as teens? Lol
[2023-01-04 00:12:52] <%$SailorScout04> Simmer*
[2023-01-04 00:12:54] <%master_blastoise> i thought they gave teens more time because of high school years, more time to do teen aspirations
[2023-01-04 00:12:54] <GoofynShady> my discord isn't working Simsie will you be streaming Disney Dreamlight Valley this week? xxxx
[2023-01-04 00:12:55] <$honeyspawn> side note: i really love that baby changed pronouns over time. it's really common for some trans people to try various pronouns, but not something you see in media often (speaking as a nonbinary person lol)
[2023-01-04 00:12:55] <%magix532> @skelaceton "early 2023" is all we have now i assume not this month but within the next couple of months
[2023-01-04 00:12:55] <%justRayxox> I wish someone would leak that information
[2023-01-04 00:12:56] <@%+MrsTomato101814> three weeks of teens is super boring to me

[2023-01-04 00:13:52] <%justRayxox> Well they said early 2023 so I would imagine within the next 12 weeks
[2023-01-04 00:13:54] <%+madisonemily8> thats a cute rug!
[2023-01-04 00:13:55] <sunshine_cutii> how are youuuu

[2023-01-04 00:13:59] <%afrench1520> my guess is March
[2023-01-04 00:14:00] <%+wrensamphire> @heatherlouise_ no problem, it's worth it! I only do about 3 rides (all slow movers) and still get so much from my visits... if you go, make sure to visit the hotels as well - you can visit if not staying and they're so nice to walk around
[2023-01-04 00:14:01] <eve_doggy> its beter then a year
[2023-01-04 00:14:02] <redshadowrose> ohhh sometime within the next 51 weeks thats close üòÖ

[2023-01-04 00:14:22] <$honeyspawn> i feel like "early 2023" means no later than march, but idk
[2023-01-04 00:14:22] <keebabey> I‚Äôm glad they didnt give a specific date, with an update that big there would probably be delays and it would be real disappointing
[2023-01-04 00:14:25] <%dibbesdedipsaus> how believe in friday the 13th???
[2023-01-04 00:14:26] <%+bigblueframes> i think first quarter is a fair bet
[2023-01-04 00:14:26] <%phloxyloxy> nope, no screen crash
[2023-01-04 00:14:32] <bibliopaige> i wonder if they‚Äôll pull a toddlers update and do a surprise drop
[2023-01-04 00:14:32] <+tehole> We all saw what happened when they tried working on it so it‚Äôs probably gonna take a while
[2023-01-04 00:14:34] <redshadowrose> I feel like early in a year is like...within the first three months
[2023-01-04 00:14:34] <honest_jackson> Nifty knitting chair had a nice purple swatch
[2023-01-04 00:14:37] <%$snowyNika> i feel like the expansions will be the same time as usual so july/november
[2023-01-04 00:14:38] <%+grimmalkin_> So Kayla what big plans do you have for early 2023? bc that's when the update will come out
[2023-01-04 00:14:42] <ztellza> have they anounsed if there's going to be an infant pack too?
[2023-01-04 00:14:46] <%+snowy_flake> that would be amazing
[2023-01-04 00:14:48] <@%+MrsTomato101814> i HOPE they would

[2023-01-04 00:14:55] <+Cammny> Generations maybe??
[2023-01-04 00:14:56] <%$sharkpopsicles> honestly, that would be awful and wonderful

Suggestions are always appreciated, but do not attempt to make demands or force Kayla to do anything. There is a difference between friendly suggestions and aggressive demands.

[2023-01-04 00:18:44] <+tehole> That would‚Äôve been a late announcement if they‚Äôre dropping it this month

[2023-01-04 00:20:18] <%+wrensamphire> @RadFoolish it's a free update, it has to be in the base game code to function... but they will probably add infant stuff in packs, just like they do for other life stages

[2023-01-04 00:21:51] <%sleeepybee_> I had to sign an NDA yearly for a while because my parents would talk about their patients without realizing I had insomnia and could hear everything

[2023-01-04 00:22:12] <%ARomanticAce> when i was in the alpha program for coral island, i was comfy enough saying i was under NDA for it bc they explicitly allowed us to say we were in the program so long as we didn't reveal anything about the game that wasn't already public. but i also didn't exactly have the devs hanging out in my chat on a regular basis, lol.

[2023-01-04 00:30:35] <laotoett> does it need an app for streaming on twitch?
[2023-01-04 00:30:36] <%+wrensamphire> @nithesimmer she streams until 7
[2023-01-04 00:30:36] <%+bubble_queen_> how much time do you suggest people put in if they just want to start streaming as a hobby?
[2023-01-04 00:30:40] <%ARomanticAce> the only thing i would highly recommend upgrading if you're starting to stream is the mic. especially with sims building and stuff, you don't need a facecam to start out, and i personally used my laptop cam for years before buying a tower (which i wanted for gaming anyway).
[2023-01-04 00:30:44] <%Dawnie3296> I want to have a cat cam too.
[2023-01-04 00:30:47] <%EuphoricNachtmahr> I've wanted to stream diff games for a while but idk shy I guess haha

[2023-01-04 00:31:25] <%nostalgicmiss> I watched one of your baking streams recently, and someone mentioned you doing apron merch, and at the time I thought it should say "Baking Stream, I'm not taking comments rights now." You just said it again and made me think of it lol

[2023-01-04 00:35:15] <@%^Moobot> simsieNo NO, DO THIS! CHANGE THIS! EWWWW! Backseat gaming is NEVER allowed. Suggestions are always appreciated, but do not attempt to make demands or force Kayla to do anything. There is a difference between friendly suggestions and aggressive demands. Ultimately she is the one playing the game, not you! simsieNo
[2023-01-04 00:35:15] <lysamcneil> I checked out littledica for the first time and he is a CC god!!

[2023-01-04 00:35:40] <%afrench1520> was it scary for you to enter into a relationship with a person from another country?
[2023-01-04 00:35:41] <%mallowsauce> I met my bf through work. I found him a new job cause I didn‚Äôt want to date a coworker lol
[2023-01-04 00:35:41] <%justRayxox> I met my partner on the internet too but some people find it strange. We have been together for 9 years and got married just before covid locked everything down. Don‚Äôt regret a thing
[2023-01-04 00:35:46] <%Cozy_Gamer8> @arithefaiiry hydration!!
[2023-01-04 00:35:50] <domesticatedcryptid6> I want to start streaming, I play sims all the time but I'm shy and don't talk all the time so idk if I can
[2023-01-04 00:35:51] <%+WillowCreekWanderer> I bet Dan never expected that chatting to a girl on Discord would lead to him moving to Florida!
[2023-01-04 00:35:52] <honest_jackson> I have such random taste in games lol
[2023-01-04 00:35:53] <yolacoka> Step away from the screen
[2023-01-04 00:35:56] <%spr0uty_boi> @arithefaiiry maybe rub the area? also drink some water.

[2023-01-04 00:36:22] <%+MrsW86> Love the purple
[2023-01-04 00:36:23] <k41mz> righttt
[2023-01-04 00:36:26] <%ARomanticAce> most streamers are variety to a degree, sort of like simsie is. she does mostly the sims, but ofc she plays other games very often! you can stick to just one game or do kinda like she does and do multiple games that you like!
[2023-01-04 00:36:26] <%magix532> @afrench1520 werewolves i think?
[2023-01-04 00:36:28] <elle_gst> very cute
[2023-01-04 00:36:28] <froggyballs101> I talk to myself when I play sims so I could just film it and bOOM

[2023-01-04 00:36:39] <@%ItIsDanya> the amount of people who tell me to just stream as a job is wild
[2023-01-04 00:36:39] [Announcement] <Moobot> We're building a purple cottage in The Sims 4! simsieHype
[2023-01-04 00:36:39] <%spontaneouskat> Purple is my favorite color
[2023-01-04 00:36:39] <%$Melly640> I have ADHD so being a variety streamer is a much due to my short attention span at times LUL but my 6-month-old puppy is causing a delay in me trying to stream again LUL
[2023-01-04 00:36:39] <%purplegirl0121> @arithefaiiry try squeezing the skin between your thumb and forefinger. Or run some cold water over your forehead.
[2023-01-04 00:36:42] <%+MrsW86> Met my now husband online
[2023-01-04 00:36:43] <ZoombiniBaby> That is SO true, do what you enjoy. I used to follow a streamer that only did what the community wanted and he burned out and quit streaming full-time
[2023-01-04 00:36:44] <honest_jackson> I have a shelf above my bed with books like that
[2023-01-04 00:36:45] <%NicholeMakes> I love those from werewolf pack.

[2023-01-04 00:36:56] <%heatherlouise_> What would you say your favourite world is in sims 4?

[2023-01-04 00:37:03] <simlishjosh> Most people play the sims for hours for a week then don‚Äôt touch it for weeks - do you not ever get bored of the sims?

[2023-01-04 00:37:11] <%justRayxox> I meant I followed you on twitch
[2023-01-04 00:37:12] <veja1> the worst that can happen is that you don't get views so I think it's worth trying
[2023-01-04 00:37:12] <%spontaneouskat> @melly640 I relate so much! That‚Äôs why I stream sims and Minecraft! It‚Äôs so fun!

[2023-01-04 00:37:21] <%ARomanticAce> also if you're the sort of person who sits and talks to themselves a lot while you're playing, you'll probably do well at streaming, lol

[2023-01-04 00:39:44] <%justRayxox> One day I played Sims for a full 14 hours. I am not proud of myself
[2023-01-04 00:39:45] <%+logicalaaalex> but if you get off I have to work so I think you should do a 48 hour stream so I don't have to work /j
[2023-01-04 00:39:47] <%+chelsearc87> I go thu phases with CAS. Sometimes i love it, others times it's exhausting
[2023-01-04 00:39:50] <abbycdefg> where do you get build inspos since you build everyday
[2023-01-04 00:39:50] <tigers123> i'm not great at cas but i love it
[2023-01-04 00:39:50] <xiaomaryyu> have you ever done a sims deaths ranking video
[2023-01-04 00:39:50] <Archscurl> Same. It‚Äôs just not fun for me

[2023-01-04 00:40:02] <%$Plourde4> I too hate CAS. I don't mind it for a little bit, i like making sims. But it gets boring after you have to do 20 outfits per sim
[2023-01-04 00:40:03] <@%+MrsTomato101814> i like making the backstories of sims more than i like making the sims

[2023-01-04 00:40:08] <%ARomanticAce> i like CAS when i have a sim to style (like a child born in my household), but i don't have as much fun just trying to make a sim out of nothing.
[2023-01-04 00:40:11] <%+alanfav11> i loveee cassss i get bored from building so fast
[2023-01-04 00:40:11] <EmilyyAbii> Do you like werewolves or vampires more?

[2023-01-04 00:40:39] <Jessesays> Tbh cas is probably my favorite aspect of the sims, I have dozens of random sims in my Library from just being bored and making sims. Which is REALLY convenient for populating a town for gameplay
[2023-01-04 00:40:39] <justamber13> i don‚Äôt like occults

[2023-01-04 00:40:52] <honest_jackson> I like doing outfits but making sims sometimes feels unhealthy bc I end up making them look too perfect and all the same yknow
[2023-01-04 00:40:53] <Archscurl> I wish there was a gallery for outfits, I‚Äôm so bad at cas my sims wear random stuff

[2023-01-04 00:43:06] <%+ChontoTheDestroyer> Those galaxy leggings are bordering on nostalgic at this point. They had SUCH a moment around 2014.
[2023-01-04 00:43:07] <Riemunen> I think sculpting the Sim's faces is fun! not that into fashion
[2023-01-04 00:43:09] <%breayonasaurus> still love my galaxy leggings

[2023-01-04 00:43:27] <abukitty> cheer150 Would it be possible to request a sims build based on the recent German 3d printed house? I'm scared of curved walls but I think this would be a fun challenge.
[2023-01-04 00:43:30] <%+kayjaaaa> Sims 3 has good cas for its time

[2023-01-04 00:43:49] <%+snarty_mcboi> I feel like you can get away with galaxy leggings as a kid/teen but not as an adult
[2023-01-04 00:43:50] <froggyballs101> My sims brothers husband cheated on him and had 3 kids that I thought were his cuz they all lived together but they were some random ladies üò≠üò≠

[2023-01-04 00:45:49] <@%brewwin> my sims all had japanese names but were white..... look...... now i'm a cultural consultant.
[2023-01-04 00:45:51] <Jessesays> I use the same jeans on like every sim
[2023-01-04 00:45:52] <ZoombiniBaby> i had a couple cybergoth outfits i downloaded as a kid and I ALWAYS used them PrideLaugh
[2023-01-04 00:45:52] <+beeepig> I usually make my female sims with basically the exact same face but that's just because a lot of the facial features just look weird imo lol
[2023-01-04 00:45:53] <frogsmybeloved> Same!
[2023-01-04 00:45:56] <%Dawnie3296> The base game combat boots.
[2023-01-04 00:45:59] <qqwertyuioo123> whos gunnu stop you
[2023-01-04 00:46:01] <%phloxyloxy> I ended up making one of my sims into a mini-me once she aged up into a teen
[2023-01-04 00:46:01] <muktaapte> all my sims have the university chancy sneakers
[2023-01-04 00:46:01] <avulolz> i olny use converse on my sims
[2023-01-04 00:46:01] <honest_jackson> The H&M stuff pack in sims 2 was iconic
[2023-01-04 00:46:02] <%+lex_in_tenebris> @cdotdark that's a cool idea
[2023-01-04 00:46:02] [Notification] benjjiii27 subscribed at Tier 1.
[2023-01-04 00:46:03] <ztellza> even with cc I can't seem to stop
[2023-01-04 00:46:05] <%soymilkcocoa> i only ever played single sims as a kid and teen until they maxed their careers and then i got bored and stopped playing for like half a year
[2023-01-04 00:46:07] <%River_09> Have u played sky: children of the light??
[2023-01-04 00:46:08] <EmilyyAbii> I keep naming my sims Alex or Blake because then I can use they/them pronouns and not have it feel very one sided with the names
[2023-01-04 00:46:10] <%Dawnie3296> I give nearly every Sim those boots.
[2023-01-04 00:46:11] <%+smooth_tortoise> I did the same, dressing sims the same outfits. But I was playing sims2 and you had to go out and buy any extra clothes
[2023-01-04 00:46:14] <svetlllama> I love those boots
[2023-01-04 00:46:14] <+tehole> I swear there were only like two hairstyles I liked in the sims 3
[2023-01-04 00:46:15] <%+snarty_mcboi> Still use them lol
[2023-01-04 00:46:15] <%justRayxox> I just realised on your last video that we can make more than one outfit for each occasion
[2023-01-04 00:46:15] <Archscurl> @cdotdark omg that‚Äôs such a good idea!
[2023-01-04 00:46:21] <%+sparkaronicus> I constantly use the combat boots lol
[2023-01-04 00:46:23] <$floral__green> i wish they‚Äôd rotate the suggested outfits bc sometimes it‚Äôs helpful
[2023-01-04 00:46:23] <SchmLinus> lol whats in that 1x1 room
[2023-01-04 00:46:23] <froggyballs101> I always used the base game sweater dress
[2023-01-04 00:46:25] <@%ItIsDanya> I always named a toddler LIly
[2023-01-04 00:46:28] <%+snarty_mcboi> I use the doc marten style boots a lot in the sims
[2023-01-04 00:46:28] <%$CarlyPea> ever since i got the werewolf pack i cant stop putting my sims in the combat boots
[2023-01-04 00:46:28] <%Sammiskate> If anyone claims that all their sims are unique they are liars
[2023-01-04 00:46:33] <%+snowy_flake> i do that with building too i get obsessed with only using the new pack furniture

[2023-01-04 00:46:42] <%+stardoo16> I used to like the name Liz and I was so mad that my sister had the middle name Elizabeth and not me

[2023-01-04 00:49:14] <%plantsy> the harmonica sensed the moment had passed and moved to oklahoma to become a farmer
[2023-01-04 00:49:14] <yeastess> noooo
[2023-01-04 00:49:16] <%+charlottelunarr> I got a harmonica for christmas 10/10 would recommend
[2023-01-04 00:49:17] <svetlllama> Wait what is sims medieval!!!!
[2023-01-04 00:49:19] <%$sharkpopsicles> oh that's so sad :( It was really sweet for you to do it in the first place. The entitlement is awful.
[2023-01-04 00:49:20] <yeastess> she will be remembered
[2023-01-04 00:49:22] <%MissNintendique> not the harmonica simsieWeenie
[2023-01-04 00:49:23] <%42hitch42> "Oops, lost my harmonica, can't do anymore birthday songs! What a shame."
[2023-01-04 00:49:25] <%Sammiskate> I got my birthday song from Dan and i felt very special
[2023-01-04 00:49:25] <%+sparkaronicus> I will always treasure the one birthday song I got lollll
[2023-01-04 00:49:25] <%magix532> also people lying about it being their birthday seemed like it would be stressful
[2023-01-04 00:49:27] <%soymilkcocoa> she didnt find the new house harmonic
[2023-01-04 00:49:29] <$daniciii300> you didn't sing me a song in august but you wished me happy birthday and that made me very happy (:
[2023-01-04 00:49:29] <$floral__green> i need a harmonica angel emote pls
[2023-01-04 00:49:30] <svetlllama> I am new here and it sounds awesome
[2023-01-04 00:49:30] <eileen_l> rip :(
[2023-01-04 00:49:31] <@%brewwin> she told us in mod chat she's not lying.
[2023-01-04 00:49:32] <+barlee89> Talk about parasocial relationships
[2023-01-04 00:49:33] <%justRayxox> I don‚Äôt expect an internet stranger to sing me a happy birthday song but I would appreciate it
[2023-01-04 00:49:33] <%+kayjaaaa> Gone but never forgotten
[2023-01-04 00:49:34] <%+crossims3112> RIP harmonica
[2023-01-04 00:49:36] <scampi_coral> a bathroom would look good there
[2023-01-04 00:49:37] <Jessesays> Honestly good for you because for me personally wishing people a happy birthday and having people wish ME a happy birthday gives me a weird about of anxiety
[2023-01-04 00:49:38] <%$userlameuserlame> it better not show up
[2023-01-04 00:49:38] <%+snowy_flake> the harmonica decided to not move with the house
[2023-01-04 00:49:41] <%heatherlouise_> They should add harmonicas into the sims, that would be fun for Stanley to make money just playing the harmonica
[2023-01-04 00:49:44] <%$melanie6673> I loved the birthday songs but I totally understand
[2023-01-04 00:49:46] <%justRayxox> Maybe Dan got rid of it
[2023-01-04 00:49:46] <froggyballs101> It‚Äôs served it‚Äôs time
[2023-01-04 00:49:49] <%+elizabethmn97> you haven't done them since early July, it's been a while
[2023-01-04 00:49:51] <@%ItIsDanya> We know all the secrets
[2023-01-04 00:49:54] <sylviat21> but that‚Äôs really truly sad. I‚Äôve watched you for many years now and even on my birthday I never said anything because I did notice the people overwhelming you
[2023-01-04 00:49:57] <+FranqlysNumber1Fan> I can say I‚Äôve had numerous harmonicas over the years, and I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever thrown one away. They‚Äôve just disappeared üòÇ

[2023-01-04 00:54:01] <@%brewwin> its only worth buying if laundry day is your favourite pack.

[2023-01-04 00:54:04] <$cloudydayes> there are worse value packs than bust the dust imo
[2023-01-04 00:54:05] <babyk1439> hi chat im lateee:(
[2023-01-04 00:54:05] <%+wrensamphire> I disabled it so the maids stop taking 10 hours to vacuum a puddle
[2023-01-04 00:54:05] <%PinkyJapan> My bust the dust pack hasn‚Äôt worked since I got it
[2023-01-04 00:54:06] <%Dawnie3296> Get Cats & Dogs and you get a roomba.
[2023-01-04 00:54:07] <thegaygirlrayleigh> What happened to the stream yesterday
[2023-01-04 00:54:08] <linabigsis> the only kit worth it was the one we got for free
[2023-01-04 00:54:08] <@%brewwin> if you hate laundry DONT BUY IT.
[2023-01-04 00:54:09] <%soymilkcocoa> I LOVE Bust the Dust and Laundry Day
[2023-01-04 00:54:10] <%CL_eoke> happy new year! today your YouTuuz finally arrived :D
[2023-01-04 00:54:12] <alexlikesfrogs2> love the idea hate the execution
[2023-01-04 00:54:19] <inapanina> that color looked so nice
[2023-01-04 00:54:19] <%$holy_marisa> Bust the dust is one of those things I refuse to buy lol
[2023-01-04 00:54:19] <%mplaczkiewicz> Does laundry get annoying? Can't decide if I want that or not!
[2023-01-04 00:54:19] <@%+MrsTomato101814> theres so many cool gameplay kits they could have made
[2023-01-04 00:54:19] <feyisim> YeH I completely agree with you
[2023-01-04 00:54:19] <EmilyyAbii> I used to say no but I haven't had any issues with it since like the first week of having it
[2023-01-04 00:54:19] <MyFriendsAreSims> I like it but I have it modded to "fix" it
[2023-01-04 00:54:19] <%heatherlouise_> @dawnie3296 That‚Äôs a good point
[2023-01-04 00:54:20] <%Maimia_> do you think that's why there haven't really been more gameplay kits?
[2023-01-04 00:54:20] <@%brewwin> but if you LOVE laundry buy bust the dust
[2023-01-04 00:54:22] <@%+ceesees> @thegaygirlrayleigh she was busy
[2023-01-04 00:54:25] <$NessieIsNotACat> i love laundry day, but that's a pack and not a kit
[2023-01-04 00:54:26] <%+kayladoesit> The only pack I don‚Äôt own simsieShake
[2023-01-04 00:54:29] <honest_jackson> Laundry day is worth it even if laundry is annoying bc the stuff is cute, but bust the dust is literally just vacuums that don‚Äôt work
[2023-01-04 00:54:29] <inapanina> the other one
[2023-01-04 00:54:31] <%+SunshineNinja92> Bust the dust makes it very easy to be focused if doing the not so berry challenge so mint can get promoted faster
[2023-01-04 00:54:33] <%+Tortoiseruler> Its nice
[2023-01-04 00:54:34] <%PinkyJapan> I think there‚Äôs a bug with it
[2023-01-04 00:54:34] <$nicolina> its.. busted
[2023-01-04 00:54:34] <%$cumby_o_boombox> simsie (or anyone else seeing this) I recently went vegetarian, any favorite meal or food ideas?
[2023-01-04 00:54:35] <%soymilkcocoa> i will be the only bust the dust defender until i die
[2023-01-04 00:54:35] <froggyballs101> I don‚Äôt like dust
[2023-01-04 00:54:36] <%$holy_marisa> @mplaczkiewicz It can be annoying with larger households but I find it can be fun
[2023-01-04 00:54:39] <%sageternal> bust the dust is not great but i would love to see more gameplay kits
[2023-01-04 00:54:45] <fearne777> How longer are you streaming for?
[2023-01-04 00:54:45] <lilspooky1998> Is this baby‚Äôs house
[2023-01-04 00:54:46] <EmilyyAbii> what about wants and fears? Do you like that?
[2023-01-04 00:54:47] <%PinkyJapan> Literally hasn‚Äôt worked once
[2023-01-04 00:54:48] <%+lex_in_tenebris> maybe one of the half paneled ones?
[2023-01-04 00:54:51] <feyisim> I wish they understood that we don‚Äôt dislike it because it‚Äôs a gameplay kit, we diike it because it‚Äôs pointless
[2023-01-04 00:54:52] <%$gothbf_> if it had been tuned better when they released it i think it would've been better
[2023-01-04 00:54:52] <%+wrensamphire> @Maimia_ no, new gameplay needs animation and it seems like they have a limited animation team right now

[2023-01-04 00:54:59] <%soymilkcocoa> the dust bunnies are the cutest things in the game im not kidding
[2023-01-04 00:54:59] <%+SunshineNinja92> I actually really like busy the dust but the dust accumulated too quickly
[2023-01-04 00:55:00] <%magix532> see i like laundry day but only for the clothes and the build not the actual laundry
[2023-01-04 00:55:01] <@%+ceesees> @lilspooky1998 no, just a build for fun
[2023-01-04 00:55:01] <%Maimia_> Can't wait to the next AC stream!!

[2023-01-04 00:55:03] <Jessesays> @archscurl Literally, it wasn‚Äôt even a nice one either, it had some stickers on it but other then that it was just a normal plastic litter box

[2023-01-04 00:55:09] <maddycat102607> laundry day i think is worth it without even using the laundry aspect, i love the build mode items
[2023-01-04 00:55:09] <linabigsis> wants and fears are super annoying
[2023-01-04 00:55:11] <%$userlameuserlame> ok but rags to riches bust the dust is EZ
[2023-01-04 00:55:11] <%+iyllia101> It's on the same level of laundry for me
[2023-01-04 00:55:13] <princess_h04> Exactly
[2023-01-04 00:55:16] <%Dawnie3296> I love the white with the wainscotting.
[2023-01-04 00:55:16] <chegmj> bust the dust is nice as another thing to do but it gets annoyng when every other day the hosue is dusty and its also currently broken for me, the houses just dont get dusty ever
[2023-01-04 00:55:19] <auntienik89> Same as laundry day

[2023-01-04 00:55:23] <$NessieIsNotACat> i like laundry day for the build and the fire potential but the laundry is a little buggy from time to time
[2023-01-04 00:55:23] <veja1> good idea but so annoying
[2023-01-04 00:55:23] <%+ChontoTheDestroyer> I liked the idea of bust the dust, but then I ACTUALLY moved into a  real life large house I have to maintain, and it quickly lost its novelty
[2023-01-04 00:55:28] <$fancyflutter> i really wish my wedding stories actually worked
[2023-01-04 00:55:28] <CygnetAlpheratz> laundry can be fun sometimes but bust the dust Never is
[2023-01-04 00:55:29] <%phloxyloxy> I feel like my Sims have enough to do with skill building without worry about extra chores
[2023-01-04 00:55:29] <+rogue_sapphire> I hate laundry but I like when my sims do it
[2023-01-04 00:55:29] <paintingbees> forever hoping in a future pack they bring back the imaginary friend from sims 3

[2023-01-04 00:55:44] <%$Plourde4> I love the laundry pack. Just hate that it's broken. Like i keep having to replace my machines bc they keep breaking
[2023-01-04 00:55:46] <girlnamedfish> a Piano?
[2023-01-04 00:55:46] <auntienik89> Not sims throwing laundry on the floor
[2023-01-04 00:55:48] <%+ThatGirlShelbyy> I refuse to buy laundry day and bust the dust , for that exact reason. It‚Äôs too much work IRL, I don‚Äôt want it in game. It causes me too much IRL stress.

[2023-01-04 00:56:06] <%cheekiimonkey> I like the washer and dryer, don't like doing the laundry. For me, the best of both worlds was finding non-functional washer and dryer CC.
[2023-01-04 00:56:06] <+tehole> I‚Äôd like laundry more if it didn‚Äôt make my sims yell at me about a dirty house after one shower
[2023-01-04 00:56:08] <keebabey> laundry is fun but I hate how often you have to do it
[2023-01-04 00:56:10] <$NessieIsNotACat> the way sims put their clean clothes on the floor and then refuse to rewash them even though they got dirty

[2023-01-04 00:56:24] <$fancyflutter> the sims randomly change their clothes too often too
[2023-01-04 00:56:25] <%$alaurel17> i cant wait until they are that bad at taking care of infants
[2023-01-04 00:56:28] <%+ChontoTheDestroyer> Laundry definitely has its place, at least. It led to one of my favorite catastrophes ever from my own gameplay.
[2023-01-04 00:56:28] <%Maimia_> They are always starting fires with the dryer!
[2023-01-04 00:56:30] <honest_jackson> Best hair in the game is the claw clip one from laundry day‚Ä¶ just saying
[2023-01-04 00:56:31] <%+sparkaronicus> omg wait your nail polish is purple too
[2023-01-04 00:56:32] <princess_h04> The sims are pretty slow when it comes to chores
[2023-01-04 00:56:33] <%joakimedlund1> its realistic tho
[2023-01-04 00:56:36] <%snarty_mcboi> Or if you only had to do laundry every few days
[2023-01-04 00:56:39] <%sapphicsoup> maybe put a bi or ace flag on the wall? something with purple
[2023-01-04 00:56:39] <$NessieIsNotACat> they wont wash wet clothes even if the wet clothes are dirty and its SO frustrating
[2023-01-04 00:56:40] <%+calicodoodle> Laundry is like my least favorite chore so I relate to the sims lack of follow through

[2023-01-04 00:56:49] <$cloudydayes> i enjoy the chaos
[2023-01-04 00:56:49] <%+awkwardimagination> i love laundry and it works great for my gameplay but the inly is the dryer likes to catch on fire/breaks on the second load always
[2023-01-04 00:56:49] <%soymilkcocoa> its not that bad imo
[2023-01-04 00:56:49] <%+wrensamphire> waiting for a Carl laundry overhaul before I ever put laundry back in game, lol

[2023-01-04 00:57:01] <%$sharkpopsicles> Simsie is a big supporter of more chaos in the sims.

[2023-01-04 00:57:18] <Swizzle_Monster> purple is my favorite color this is great haha
[2023-01-04 00:57:19] <thegaygirlrayleigh> Yeah, Sims in some cases aren't very smart.

[2023-01-04 01:04:03] <+lunavaria> if the little blanket on the chair was purple instead of blue, it'd be perfect, but it's somewhat throwing it off for me lol
[2023-01-04 01:04:06] <%Dawnie3296> The silver blanket works with the room.
[2023-01-04 01:04:06] <%+minleafy> maybe put a rocking chair in the open corner where the desk was going to go?
[2023-01-04 01:04:07] <$NessieIsNotACat> purple and orange are so disrespected in the sims

It‚Äôs super adjustable, it‚Äôs the Titan , and the XL size but he almost wishes he got the regular one because the XL is definitely bigger than the average by a good couple inches

[2023-01-04 01:06:56] <%ARomanticAce> you can kinda make an upright piano using the brown swatch on the keyboard and stacking console tables behind it, but you have to be careful about how and it still only gives you like 1 look

[2023-01-04 01:06:58] <stareemz> cute

[2023-01-04 15:16:07] <c_mics> To get a five star island technically. You want to attract a celebrity to your island to perform.
[2023-01-04 15:16:09] <lobsterman639> ok sorry
[2023-01-04 15:16:10] <justaivlys> @aussieredneck22 its really cool, you basically build your own island, you can talk to your villagers, and decorate, they have shops in game to buy clothes and furniture.

[2023-01-04 15:31:11] <banana_in_boots> @mellowxyellow0 no, you get the island at the beginning of the game
[2023-01-04 15:31:13] <lexiunderwood1> they can live in the forest
[2023-01-04 15:31:14] <+itsjustflan> did you make a whole new island or is this a on a different switch?

[2023-01-04 15:31:31] <%$desert_koala94> The space section or campsite can go by the farm

[2023-01-04 16:07:00] <@%^Moobot> @kadquer We're not playing The Sims today! Kayla is interested in other games too, and we want to play them sometimes! Please don't make a big deal about it or guilt her in chat. It's really upsetting to have people complaining all day when we're just trying to have fun. She has TONS of Sims content on YouTube, and we'll play The Sims again later this week.
[2023-01-04 16:07:00] <%$mistikfic> I will never be upset tuning in to unanticipated stardew lol
[2023-01-04 16:07:00] <%Missygirl93> I feel this... there's so many games I want on Steam, but I don't have time! The remastered ones.

[2023-01-04 16:08:35] <+TrevorPaintz> it is really hard to make them look natural again for whatever reason
[2023-01-04 16:08:38] <%$aridgraye> have you ever tried playing any of the harvest moon games? I used to play them all the time
[2023-01-04 16:08:41] <PeeshoPeesho> shes so sleepy baby

[2023-01-04 16:09:01] <%isaZbela> also it's much more fun to do it with friends, i find terraforming so boring and time consuming when i dont do it alongside one of your streams!!
[2023-01-04 16:09:01] <RottenBioHazard> Story of seasons was made by the original creator i beleive
[2023-01-04 16:09:02] <yo_a_ti_cas> Supernatural?

[2023-01-04 16:09:06] <%$lavenderwhy> i tired  to redo the rivers and flattened my island, but gave up  half way through and its been messy trying to put things back in a natural way
[2023-01-04 16:09:09] <%rabidFairy> story of seasons is harvest moon
[2023-01-04 16:09:12] <%$chwelseaa> story of seasons is i think by the people that originally made harvest moon??? i think???
[2023-01-04 16:09:15] <Quagsire_Joe> @Quagsire_Joe lots of people i know personally stopped really quickly and i havent seen it on twitch...not that ive bothered to look but thats besides the point
[2023-01-04 16:09:16] <%Jeais> Would you play the HM Wonderful Life remake when it comes out?
[2023-01-04 16:09:17] <%+faoncat> yeah they remade some of the old harvest moons under the story of seasons name

[2023-01-04 16:09:33] <%+maiziemaze23> Story of Seasons is Harvest Moon. There was a company dispute between the makers and distributors and the creators lost the name. That's the new name.
[2023-01-04 16:09:34] <Aetherah> story of seasons was made by the original creators of harvest moon they just can't use the name

[2023-01-04 16:09:57] <%+SunshineNinja92> There is a whole thing with Story of Seasons vs Harvest Moon. Long story short SoS is HM and the new HM games aren‚Äôt made by the original creators of the franchise.

[2023-01-04 16:20:00] <AmethystWyvernZephyr> @sydknee__ ^
[2023-01-04 16:20:00] <$stinki_cheese> SCREW JK ROWLING!!
[2023-01-04 16:20:01] <%gracenottheface> its also cultural impact. like you‚Äôre giving her social capital
[2023-01-04 16:20:02] VIEWERS: 2¬†302
[2023-01-04 16:20:03] <heyitscrystal26> good for you!!
[2023-01-04 16:20:03] <%bravelittletaylor> it's also antisemitic
[2023-01-04 16:20:03] <%maybeitswieb> the devs already got paid. royalties go jkr
[2023-01-04 16:20:04] <shenglowts> HELLOOO
[2023-01-04 16:20:09] <animatedwomen29> Also the plot of the story is not good
[2023-01-04 16:20:09] <%marlibuuuu> principles guys let's not argue
[2023-01-04 16:20:09] <%Vexasaurus_rex> Let it bomb screw Jk Rowling
[2023-01-04 16:20:09] <clumsyorca> plus the fact the game & the series supports slave labour?? ew
[2023-01-04 16:20:11] <gr3yskull20> Nah that‚Äôs kinda slay queen
[2023-01-04 16:20:12] <%gracenottheface> also the storyline of the game itself is very gross
[2023-01-04 16:20:13] <%emsims74> wait was is simsie talking about
[2023-01-04 16:20:13] <%+madisonemily8> its taking a stand against something and demonstrating that you don't support it
[2023-01-04 16:20:17] <%+Pizza_Party_Princess> Yeah, no thanks. Jk is the worst.
[2023-01-04 16:20:17] <@%^Moobot> simsieNo NO, DO THIS! CHANGE THIS! EWWWW! Backseat gaming is NEVER allowed. Suggestions are always appreciated, but do not attempt to make demands or force Kayla to do anything. There is a difference between friendly suggestions and aggressive demands. Ultimately she is the one playing the game, not you! simsieNo
[2023-01-04 16:20:18] <%+drinkingwinewithdragons> Yeeees !!
[2023-01-04 16:20:21] <+Cozapalmtree> hogwarts legacy is also antisemitic according to jewish creators as it is based on blood libel conspiracy, its baddd
[2023-01-04 16:20:21] <%+KonfusedKitty> @madisonemily8 this
[2023-01-04 16:20:21] <+spykebb> well put!
[2023-01-04 16:20:23] <benthe_kuijpers> Wait i was gone about what game are we talking, cause that's horrible
[2023-01-04 16:20:24] <%$mistikfic> Any devs working on it should see why people have a problem supporting the game
[2023-01-04 16:20:24] <%isaZbela> that is such an amazing stand simsie thank you!
[2023-01-04 16:20:25] <%+snowy_flake> it stands against principles
[2023-01-04 16:20:25] <heyitscrystal26> also they got paid either way? the devs are done their job
[2023-01-04 16:20:26] <@%$Little_Dica> we are talking about the upcoming harry potter game
[2023-01-04 16:20:26] <%DFTBAlana> @sydknee__ i feel like no one ever talks about this outside the jewish community
[2023-01-04 16:20:26] <%+emmie_mage> im trans and i fully agree with you
[2023-01-04 16:20:26] <$whatkyla> you also have a huge following - you playing it is basically just advertising it! theres a lot of impact to that
[2023-01-04 16:20:28] <%$peaceloveAlex> Good morning!!

[2023-01-04 16:20:31] <%42hitch42> yeah the devs have been paid. they're not going to see the actual profits.
[2023-01-04 16:20:32] <%bublerry> plus JK Rowling is really antisemitic and just horrible in every way
[2023-01-04 16:20:33] <$stinki_cheese> kayla you are so well spoken
[2023-01-04 16:20:33] <%klaf10211> What game?

[2023-01-04 16:20:34] <Aetherah> makes perfect sense
[2023-01-04 16:20:36] <@%+MrsTomato101814> kayla is also in a unique position where she has the power to set a good example to MANY many people
[2023-01-04 16:20:37] <!+sydknee__> @DFTBAlana i agree and that's why im saying it

[2023-01-04 16:35:27] <%gracenottheface> people are so weird like that. like why do you feel the need?
[2023-01-04 16:35:28] <%+trinka08> Hold up, people focus on looks instead of personality and how talented you are? I am so sorry you have to deal with that.

[2023-01-04 16:35:33] <Annerie__> It proves my point how judgemental people are on looks, nobody first of all chose how they look, and second it doesnt matter as long as you are an ok person
[2023-01-04 16:35:34] <+Ricksy_Bizness> I have a weird nose but I love it. I wouldn't change it for the world. I have a hooked nose and my bridge is not smooth but I think that's what makes me look different than other people.

[2023-01-04 16:35:53] <raekir> i'm biased about eyebrows, i'm a permanent makeup tech and i learned eyebrows first. so i think you'd be a great candidate for pmu brows. but not because yours are bad. you'd just look even nicer with less upkeep.
[2023-01-04 16:35:55] <%clochie_cat> Your nose suits your face perfectly!

[2023-01-04 16:36:00] <%+Becca__06> You're such a beautiful and sweet person, i can't understand why people would hate on you :(
[2023-01-04 16:36:00] <pcddiva> Tbh my nose is an insecurity of mine too so for you to say that people give out about your nose is crazy.. but it gives me confidence to know that you're going through something similar
[2023-01-04 16:36:01] <%$chaelinsthighs> i think cozy games are a target for trolls bc they get off on ruining the good environment ;-;

[2023-01-04 16:39:49] <%+regardinglove> high school is ROUGH
[2023-01-04 16:39:51] <+KayyeTea> not all things that pop into your head should be voiced outloud

[2023-01-04 16:39:54] <%NicholleStephani> I‚Äôve heard a saying that basically says when it comes to criticizing people‚Äôs appearance, if they can‚Äôt fix it in 10 seconds, don‚Äôt say it.  So basically, if I have a smudge of something on my face, tell me, but if you don‚Äôt like my nose, keep it to yourself.

[2023-01-04 16:44:43] <msmiscellaneous> There needs to be a body movement where we just don‚Äôt talk about other peoples appearances unless prompted. Like, some compliments can even come off wrong
[2023-01-04 16:44:44] <+okjessicaa> Middle school was something lol everyone was so mean
[2023-01-04 16:44:48] <%+cyclingcyborg> i always got bullied for my big eyes ["frog eyes"] and my "spider fingers", because they're so long and spindly, and now a lot people always compliment me for my big sparkly [deer] eyes and gentle, delicate fingers, which i can agree to, but i STILL get insecure to this days because of those comments from fellow teens and kids at that age
