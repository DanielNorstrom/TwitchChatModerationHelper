[2022-12-25 11:42:33] <Laugh_BDO> 50? probably will be 100
[2022-12-25 11:42:36] <OnlyGFL> @vilkra in trixion it just reset auto when it's 11 ++ armor etc im just wondering if we can auto reset as well in real fight without going out

[2022-12-25 13:53:37] <dhaosnkborrbarad> so yesterday, i wanted to hone my alt from 1472 to 1490. I had 1K Bound leapstones. I thought " okay, this might be enough if i get lucky ". I was honing all pieces,  wasnt focused on just one ( so like i could quit honing if i was unlucky, to get argos gold)
[2022-12-25 13:53:53] <dhaosnkborrbarad> When i  reached 0 leapstones, i was still 1472

[2022-12-25 15:45:19] <Hollowness> @nil2434 so i need to stop honing at +18 right?
[2022-12-25 15:45:37] <gionnisins> 17 i believe
[2022-12-25 15:45:40] <Hollowness> +18 Is 1570. a Little over gear Is always nice.

[2022-12-25 15:45:51] <Nil2434> @Hollowness I mean thats upto you. Honing cost until +20 is not that high. Its the shard and the silver thats the bottleneck for me personally.
[2022-12-25 15:46:21] <Hollowness> yeah, i have notice that too, even the amount of leapstones Is really low as well.
[2022-12-25 15:46:22] <$oAllDayo> man I'm struggling on NA I have 4 1460 one 1475 with no great honors and went gold broke making my main and pally 5-3
[2022-12-25 15:46:32] <Hollowness> akkhan hard Is +22 right?
[2022-12-25 15:46:59] <opwp_madruski> wait i have never seen this mech before
[2022-12-25 15:47:09] <Hollowness> @oalldayo i feel you. which engraiving you pick?
[2022-12-25 15:47:15] <Nil2434> @opwp_madruski its just the normal stagger pattern wdym
[2022-12-25 15:47:20] <happy_but_sad> no offense but why would u go 5=3 on pala? @oAllDayo
[2022-12-25 15:47:32] <Nil2434> medusa is there during the stagger
[2022-12-25 15:47:33] <opwp_madruski> @Nil2434  the mech before that.

[2022-12-25 15:47:54] <$oAllDayo> quick question so you prefer surge over remaining, why? surge just hits hard but remaining does more overall right? I have two DB one surge and one remaining feel like my remaining is always mvp 4
[2022-12-25 15:47:56] <Nil2434> the meteor?
[2022-12-25 15:48:03] <opwp_madruski> yea with the aoe
[2022-12-25 15:48:07] <+extralubee> typing test has always been there
[2022-12-25 15:48:08] <Hollowness> @happy_but_sad because the More engraiving, the More utility you have, and Support are starting to get gatekeep
[2022-12-25 15:48:09] <Nil2434> meteor and typing test is also part of the normal mode
[2022-12-25 15:48:17] <Nil2434> then you stagger
[2022-12-25 15:48:40] <opwp_madruski> i mean it wasnt a mech but more like i saw meteors falling and it was after the typing and the stagger
[2022-12-25 15:48:45] <kyuub1i1> @oAllDayo surge does more btw
[2022-12-25 15:48:48] <happy_but_sad> Who gatekeeps supp statics in g6 brel?
[2022-12-25 15:49:18] <kyuub1i1> @oAllDayo but support wise, yeah remaining energy is nice.
[2022-12-25 15:49:19] <%+Mistressapocalypse> these stickers are so cute
[2022-12-25 15:49:47] <Hollowness> @happy_but_sad i do as the other support. if you dont put effort into your build, you wont into the mechanics, and you bring less to the rsid

[2022-12-25 15:49:57] <+extralubee> I've seen supp get kicked only cause they hostage the run
[2022-12-25 15:50:06] <$oAllDayo> @kyuub1i1 ik but my remaining hits consistently 7-16m my surge hits like 2-4m but surge hits 19-40m seems like remaining does overall more as of right now
[2022-12-25 15:50:38] <Hollowness> I'm glad that support are getting a reality check. as support Main Is beyong crazy how much we can get away in this game
[2022-12-25 15:50:42] <Nil2434> @oAllDayo 40m surge? My guy it hits 60m+ at 1490 in trix.
[2022-12-25 15:50:46] <+flvy_> go into trixion and test it then
[2022-12-25 15:50:54] <$oAllDayo> I'm 1460
[2022-12-25 15:51:07] <happy_but_sad> My 1460 surge does like 50m
[2022-12-25 15:51:08] <%+Kaizeo_> oAllDayo do u have full entropy
[2022-12-25 15:51:09] <happy_but_sad> In raids
[2022-12-25 15:51:12] <happy_but_sad> Sometimes i do 55

[2022-12-25 15:51:16] <Hollowness> i mean all my 1500 (4 of them) support have 5x3, lvl 7 gems, lvl 60.
[2022-12-25 15:51:17] <Nil2434> Ah back in 1460 hits 60m in raids
[2022-12-25 15:51:18] <+kaboom_info> if an outside safe circle happens in like the purple and blue one, and she does that one again it cant be outside safe again right ? Like the one after has to be inside safe or is it random

[2022-12-25 15:52:25] <Nil2434> @kyuub1i1 I was in this caliligos run. First run took 4 mins cause every surge critted for 90m+. Second run none critted and it took 7 mins Despairge
[2022-12-25 15:52:26] <happy_but_sad> Sadly surge does more than deathblow
[2022-12-25 15:52:32] <$oAllDayo> I just need gold tbh so I can get books and decided what to do
[2022-12-25 15:52:33] <kyuub1i1> @opwp_madruski yeah it's a BIG if xdd
[2022-12-25 15:52:44] <kyuub1i1> yeah surge is a win or go home class xdd
[2022-12-25 15:52:45] <Nil2434> @happy_but_sad deathblow is faster burst
[2022-12-25 15:52:47] <%+jerei__> @hollowness yeah i've heard its abit difficult
[2022-12-25 15:53:04] <happy_but_sad> Yes but surge still does more
[2022-12-25 15:53:08] <kyuub1i1> if every surge crits, holy fck your dps is through the roof, but if not Despairge

[2022-12-25 15:54:05] <$oAllDayo> idk if that matters
[2022-12-25 15:54:13] <Nil2434> Deathblow feels more smooth to play at endgame.
[2022-12-25 15:54:31] <Nil2434> Source: I have 1500+ deathblow, surge blade and shock scrapper
[2022-12-25 15:54:38] <Hollowness> @jerei__ in do Sonic vibra (before appair) and kill it with Prelude, shot a sound shock and finish with bucket shot snd the last one used soundholic(from 2 position)
[2022-12-25 15:55:15] <%monts18> just throw nade
[2022-12-25 15:55:35] <%+Kaizeo_> wtf 231m surge already?!
[2022-12-25 15:55:35] <happy_but_sad> I know surge is despairge in endgame but still if u hit all ur surges u will do more than any other class
[2022-12-25 15:55:36] <+extralubee> can throw 2 names to be safer
[2022-12-25 15:55:38] <kyuub1i1> @Nil2434 yeah trix dps at the end is not an indicator of what the "strongest" class is. in theory it's surge (if everything crits and you have perfect stacking etc...) so many variables, whilst db striker doesn't have that many variables
[2022-12-25 15:55:38] <happy_but_sad> Plus if u crit
[2022-12-25 15:55:40] <%monts18> after shapes you will never ue whirlwind again anyways

[2022-12-25 15:56:57] <Nil2434> @kyuub1i1 yeah db striker is much smoother from my experience. Surge needs a good amount of raid knowledge.

[2022-12-25 18:44:53] <%Fluorite_Eyes_Vivy> by the time he did it it was 51G vs 82G
[2022-12-25 18:45:28] <%Fluorite_Eyes_Vivy> Now it's 50G to 70G ish
[2022-12-25 18:45:35] <@%+Shikiro> @arcanegast to actually see the gold, you need to not hone or do anything with gold for the whole week
[2022-12-25 18:45:44] <drewline_yk> @Fluorite_Eyes_Vivy is he going to hone with it or no?

[2022-12-25 19:16:38] <+Imrahel> @ATK and everyone Merry x-mas! guys between Sharpshooter, Gunlancer, Deadeye, Shadowhunter, and Destroyer which would you push to 1490 for brel? as a viable dps or in lancer's case support dps
[2022-12-25 19:16:55] VIEWERS: 1 234

[2022-12-25 19:17:40] <WestSan> @Imrahel gunlancer is the only one that isnt gonna get as gatekept as the others. But all are good
[2022-12-25 19:17:56] <+Imrahel> yeah as a solo most likely

[2022-12-25 22:00:31] <ZenithWho> @RyK_____ well... if you do choose to upload stuff onto the internet like what some twitch streamers do on osu, it becomes an issue
[2022-12-25 22:01:00] <냥냐이냐냥이 (gideryo_)> rhythm games have poor business model because of copyright issues
