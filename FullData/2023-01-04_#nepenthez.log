[2023-01-04 15:29:51] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> I think it makes it a bit more of a grind in some ways tbh. Shows how to generate coins and get involved at a lower level. I think its why a lot of people who dont have coins dont feel like league SBC method works
[2023-01-04 15:29:55] <Mr_Arneg> I think alternating sbcs may be faster than doing 5 premiums first

I understand the point of carrying on for people that have more time if you were to trade from 10K to 100K but is there anything wrong with ending now and saying you know what...this isn't efficient for people wanting to do it quickly?

[2023-01-04 16:12:53] <+alang_93> they should take out injuries cards in packs and replace them with coin boost cards would help players gain alot more coins

[2023-01-04 16:12:56] <%+happyspoon897> I guess what I'm trying to say it was Josh has said, like I said in my message before - is there anything wrong with not seeing it through because it's almost not possible? (sorry bad word selection)
[2023-01-04 16:13:01] <%+Th1sSecretN1nj4> yeah cause other fifa "speed runs" are lets see how big my team gets is arbitrary. this there's a set goal.
[2023-01-04 16:13:09] <sterudd123> Could you not do BPM and whilst you wait for those players to sell do a draft?
[2023-01-04 16:13:11] <DirTyD3NN> I think after 6 and once totws are in packs I think it will be  more achievable
[2023-01-04 16:13:24] <+jd_ed1> @alang_93 that would kill the market further though as inflation would destroy the market
[2023-01-04 16:13:44] <SirVilgaudas> Neuer was super lucky pull

[2023-01-04 16:16:54] <+shadowz476> @kingnovakin i know but like back in the day them man always used to be like best friends now its not like that
[2023-01-04 16:16:56] <freeSaf_> I just got mbappe from a undratable 25k pack omds
[2023-01-04 16:17:02] <%+spareribzzz> if only the pack probabilities were shown
[2023-01-04 16:17:04] <%+markcheesyy> do you want to grind to the 4 hours. open all rewards and see the team?
[2023-01-04 16:17:07] <+jrossino> @howdyitsdavid yeh it‚Äôs noticeable - you rarely see the discard ones let alone mid / high tier doesn‚Äôt exist
[2023-01-04 16:17:09] <dillpill270> Any good WW card players so far?
[2023-01-04 16:17:12] <SirVilgaudas> you still didnt open your objective rewards, i got Mbappe from those yesterday
[2023-01-04 16:17:13] <+mattyitfc99> Do you think they‚Äôve turned down pack weight as winter wildcards are unpackable
[2023-01-04 16:17:16] <+marcuspilk> Don't know if I'm late to the party but Pope has been upgraded finally
[2023-01-04 16:17:25] <%+kingnovakin> @shadowz476 things change, content changes, doesn't mean they aren't talking anymore just bc they don't do many vids together now
[2023-01-04 16:17:32] <%+howdyitsdavid> @jrossino makes me wonder if EA felt like they went too far and now they're overcorrecting.
[2023-01-04 16:17:46] <+konthenurse> sometimes you do 1 round and get everything back and then some and sometimes 3 rounds at it yields absolutely nothing
[2023-01-04 16:17:49] <%+howdyitsdavid> Because clearly pack weight was in a generous place around Black Friday
[2023-01-04 16:17:52] <+shadowz476> @kingnovakin when was the last vid they did together?

[2023-01-04 16:18:56] <alxselpsn> I think that EA just changed probability for this SBC. Because at start of this SBC - I've also got a lot of walkouts both tradable and untradable. Bot now only untradables and 2-3 times less then for example in first 3 days
[2023-01-04 16:19:02] <Mcr_xMaYheMx> 1 pack can change everything nep

[2023-01-04 16:20:09] <%+rickd96> a video on not completing the objective run also shows how hard it is to make coins without playinf rivals/WL/squadbattles. good content for a lot of players

[2023-01-04 16:20:44] <thelameloballe> @here4rewards_ still talked so much shit to just pull out
[2023-01-04 16:21:00] <alxselpsn> And due to the fact that probability of walkouts is so low, the players become cheaper and cheaper. So if in the first 3 days ligue1 common players were like 4-5k, they now cost 2k at most. So for now its imposible to get coins from this
[2023-01-04 16:21:03] <%+teasyy_tom> i think people respect your realness nep. so say it how it is u üêêüß°
[2023-01-04 16:21:07] <%+mikekozy23> playing at least one of those drafts could've been huge

[2023-01-04 16:24:31] <alxselpsn> @alxselpsn but If at start you've got this players (Ligue1 commons or Eredivisie Commons) tradable - you can sell them for 4-5k, and do something like Lans, that was a lot cheaper then others, you can make profit. But now - you can't

[2023-01-04 16:36:33] <Jor0sLaFF> yes , as a massive menu grinder but also who plays a lot there is massive difference

[2023-01-04 16:36:44] <$xJDinvasion> This game is build to lose coins for you if you just play the game and do sbcs

[2023-01-04 16:37:27] <Jor0sLaFF> so lets say u hit 1 mill coin player or 200-300k player from one the treadable packs and u are good to go, u can do the sbc 10 times and get something good from the objectives packs

[2023-01-04 16:47:20] <@sorarejosh> my worry with burnley players is them getting promoted
[2023-01-04 16:47:20] <fut_finz> Im not an expert on Sorare and thought to ask you that do you know if capped 240 requires 5 from same  type or can you use a common gk for limited for example
[2023-01-04 16:47:33] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> For top tier rewards I agree, the low scoring keeper is better. For threshold, I dont know

[2023-01-04 16:55:13] <+GeorgeCuz> @danarlli 250 points with a team with L15 of 240 iirc
[2023-01-04 16:55:16] <$alexwilsonontwitch> Brazil doesn't start until April as well
[2023-01-04 16:55:26] <@%Witchwalker70> Yes they've signed Ricardo
[2023-01-04 16:55:26] <%AHumanAlien> @danarlli Cap will be 240 for L15. You will need to score 250 pts

[2023-01-04 16:59:50] <%eatburgers1> the problem with the changes are that you can't have a "threshold team" that you just lock in and gtind each week.

[2023-01-04 17:02:39] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> I feel like defensive mids should get 5 points for a clean sheet
[2023-01-04 17:02:43] <mulzy67> cheers
[2023-01-04 17:02:59] <%AHumanAlien> Amazing score considering

[2023-01-04 17:03:26] <%AHumanAlien> Nayir always seems to score
[2023-01-04 17:03:26] <%+GPNR11> Had eysseric in and he scored a 100 but captained him and got 142
[2023-01-04 17:03:34] <$frasermc_> bilal was one of 2 U23 keepers playing this GW
[2023-01-04 17:03:47] <@sorarejosh> someone like partey just aint good for the matrix, with how good arsenal have been, the lack of 60+ for him is mad

[2023-01-04 17:04:35] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> Its removing ambiguity. I think theres enough in football that you dont need "duel" as a stat right
[2023-01-04 17:04:39] <%AHumanAlien> What do Opta define as a tackle?
[2023-01-04 17:05:01] <+Jamie602> opta scoring of tackles is weird, some look nailed on and don't get scored
[2023-01-04 17:05:05] <alexanderwidell> Would you say 200.34 for 3/5 players is alright for my first ever lineup for casual common?
[2023-01-04 17:05:12] <%AHumanAlien> What do Opta define a a duel?
[2023-01-04 17:05:12] <%m3elv1n> isnt that also a clearance
[2023-01-04 17:05:18] <alexanderwidell> 200 .34
[2023-01-04 17:05:32] <stennnnnnnnnnnnnnnn> arsenal robbed yesterday :((
[2023-01-04 17:05:52] <DazBala10> I think as long as it doesnt go back to the same newcastle player Gabriel tackled, then it should count
[2023-01-04 17:05:53] <%+Dilly_666> that's a clearance tho
[2023-01-04 17:06:01] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> Should be "tackle gained possesion" and "tackle not gained possession". You should be rewarded for the tackle whether you win the ball or not
[2023-01-04 17:06:08] <%AHumanAlien> It seems Partey's good performances don't translate to Opta

[2023-01-04 17:06:42] <%+Th1sSecretN1nj4> @SpreadsheetFifa yeah like a .25 for tackle but not won and .5 for tackle gained.
[2023-01-04 17:06:55] <%whufcconnor> do UC use Opta?
[2023-01-04 17:06:55] <%+Dilly_666> @SpreadsheetFifa but a tackle not gaining possession is a clearance isn't it?
[2023-01-04 17:06:57] <@sorarejosh> u gotta remember , sorare wanna keep pts as low as possible , to make hitting threshold as hard as possible
[2023-01-04 17:07:08] <%blazer33x> Hey Nep
[2023-01-04 17:07:27] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> @SpreadsheetFifa I wouldnt class it as a clearance. A tackle does not have to push the ball further away from goal right?
[2023-01-04 17:07:27] <here4rewards_> @sorarejosh fix that by just making threshold higher
[2023-01-04 17:07:37] <mikegreenyt> you just going back on fifa at 6 nep ?

[2023-01-04 17:08:52] <@sorarejosh> wont it just exagerate the difference between the small and big clubs, and make the zenit stacks etc even more op?
[2023-01-04 17:09:02] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> Potentially but I also feel like it ruins good players at bad clubs.

[2023-01-04 17:10:45] <$frasermc_> I actually think trippier might be the most meta player on this platform in the current matrix
[2023-01-04 17:10:49] <%$sheesh1000> Is trippier more expensive?
[2023-01-04 17:11:05] <@sorarejosh> works both ways tho , that same game he had 16 possession lost

[2023-01-04 17:13:24] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> "A tackle won is deemed to be where the tackler or one of his team-mates regains possession as a result of the challenge, or that the ball goes out of play and is ‚Äúsafe‚Äù. A tackle lost is where a tackle is made but the ball goes to an opposition player. Both are deemed as successful tackles however, the outcome of the tackle (won or lost) is different based on where the ball goes after the tackle."

[2023-01-04 17:16:16] <%eatburgers1> on draftkings you get points for a cross, even if it goes to nobody, so you have lobg ball merchants getting loads of points whereas the same player on sorare would be penalised massively for losing possession a lot

[2023-01-04 17:16:23] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> Opta dont define a penalty area entry as a cross into the box as far as I can see. Its an "entry into the penalty box with a high defree of control over the ball"
[2023-01-04 17:16:30] <+Tomkinson111> do you think the scoring being capped at 100 ruins it a bit?

[2023-01-04 17:21:28] <%eatburgers1> its also much easier to "predict" matchups in NBA because if a team gives away a lot of rebounds and you have a good rebounder... makes sense they will score well, in football a lot of the scores are much more dependant on decisives which are kind of one off events and may or may not happen due to variance, rather than cumulative smaller actions like in basketball

[2023-01-04 17:23:43] <DazBala10> I had under 5 bookings....ended up being 9!!
[2023-01-04 17:23:50] <+tomtaz10> ref was shocking
[2023-01-04 17:23:53] <+dezzyb2793> anyone thinks that shirt pull wasnt a pen are deluded literally had his own name on his chest LUL LUL LUL

[2023-01-04 17:25:09] <+jlt167> How many times have we seen players get away with this. Referees need to make stance
[2023-01-04 17:25:10] <+RazorKameo> ref set a precedant too early for what goes as a yellow which meant he lost control from then on
[2023-01-04 17:25:16] <reddyd> no answer lol

[2023-01-04 17:25:22] <+kilvino> yes but there are lots of wrong ref decisions across the season
[2023-01-04 17:25:22] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> @kilvino Whats the point in discussing Nep discussing the performance of the ref. Hes already said it, the sentence is over.
[2023-01-04 17:25:28] <+DavyeBee24> old firm was 2 days ago and we are still talking about the ref haha

[2023-01-04 17:26:54] <Saloo94> Bring it back
[2023-01-04 17:26:57] <%+futbolistic97> Yeah looking back the world cup ET should be implemented everywhere
[2023-01-04 17:26:57] <+kilvino> I dont care for them. thats why I cant think of them TBH
[2023-01-04 17:26:57] <+kahnbayern> i hope that Arsenal will win the title

[2023-01-04 17:27:05] <%+jacktwoodard00> Bowen on mendy was horrendous
[2023-01-04 17:27:05] <logankerr96> Stats came out out today that the ball was only in play for 47 minutes in the entire game
[2023-01-04 17:27:09] <+RazorKameo> ref wanted the headline
[2023-01-04 17:27:09] <Dash_counter7> The ball was in play for only 43:17 minutes
[2023-01-04 17:27:09] <%$istreet98> They need to bring back clock stopping like in rugby
[2023-01-04 17:27:11] <%$Rocastle78> Toon really getting a reputation across the league for time wasting. Fully deserved.
[2023-01-04 17:27:13] <%+seanranson1> man city vs aston villa, coutiho should have scored but ref blew for foul which wasnt a foul
[2023-01-04 17:27:14] <mgoat94> I can't hear u nep
[2023-01-04 17:27:18] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> I actually like the 60 minute "live ball" timer. Would make so much sense
[2023-01-04 17:27:20] <+kilvino> Both ARS and NEW played well. I enjoyed the match
[2023-01-04 17:27:24] <%m3elv1n> almiron yellow?
[2023-01-04 17:27:27] <%krk0707> Try having the Spanish ref lahoz
[2023-01-04 17:27:35] <mattyav91> @shdw_moses yes, published on 22nd of December, 6 decisions they got wrong including the Martinelli goal
[2023-01-04 17:27:42] <+joejeff121> Can‚Äôt be giving an amateur ref a game as big as arsenal v newcastle
[2023-01-04 17:27:44] <+tt_spamz4949> the gordies are cheaters time wasters
[2023-01-04 17:27:46] <+Jamie602> i saw a stat that the ball was only in play for 40 something mins
[2023-01-04 17:27:46] <%+thewalshman> what about villas goal against united before the WC
[2023-01-04 17:27:48] <+plantedwharf545> @seanranson1 Ederson literally let it in, was an easy save
[2023-01-04 17:27:49] <@%CaniSports> how are your teams looking sir? @NepentheZ
[2023-01-04 17:27:49] <+xRandy_Marsh> Newcastle wasted about 70mins vs Utd too
[2023-01-04 17:27:51] <+ClubCrackerz> Cucurella hair pull
[2023-01-04 17:27:52] <jack_russell67> shocking refs been robbing arsenal for years, we probably didn't do enough to win the game bit the refs always fucks us
[2023-01-04 17:27:54] <%caseymccabe13> Great game management from Newcastle poor from the officials
[2023-01-04 17:27:57] <+tt_spamz4949> newcastle rigged it ref shit
[2023-01-04 17:27:58] <%+pierce_23> i like the live ball but i do love the shit housery holding it in the corner so its tough
[2023-01-04 17:28:01] <%+AT000> As a chelsea fan this season has been a tough one to complain about refs cause the team‚Äôs performance has been general shitty. But still overall refereeing has been shitty in EPL.. Cucurella hair pull from spurs still pisses me off both refs and var ignored that ..
[2023-01-04 17:28:03] <dilplays> this game could cost arsenal the title
[2023-01-04 17:28:03] <+kahnbayern> finish him neppo
[2023-01-04 17:28:06] <%+pierce_23> maybe a minimum game time would be better suited
[2023-01-04 17:28:07] <+eagleeye_ix> I do feel sorry for Refs with the amount of tactical fouls in the modern game...it swings back and fourth between too lienent and too harsh
[2023-01-04 17:28:18] <+tt_spamz4949> FINISH HIM

[2023-01-04 17:28:21] <+jjmiles16> The ball was in play for 43 minutes, game was terrible
[2023-01-04 17:28:22] <%+kingnovakin> found it hilarious Newcastle crying about Leeds time wasting at the weekend but have no issue doing it themselves!
[2023-01-04 17:28:26] <%+always_rainy98> its interesting, i would like to see a live ball timer but ultimately we'd see much less upsets or underdog wins because shithousery is a massive part of that
[2023-01-04 17:28:27] <%cerrronnneeetfl> There‚Äôs been a lot of questionable decisions in the past from refs tbf to him
[2023-01-04 17:28:28] <%+MlKE_2023> There defo should have been more time than the 5 minutes that‚Äôs why I liked the World Cup punishing time wasting
[2023-01-04 17:28:29] <+RazorKameo> as a newcastle fan that was shocking to watch tbh. hate this time wasting mentality
[2023-01-04 17:28:31] <%+seanranson1> Every club wastes time, cant just say newcastle are cheats for time wasting. Its time management
[2023-01-04 17:28:31] <mrmikey2509> When a ref pulls out some early cards then they feel they need to keep it going and we end up with loads of bookings. Not a good way to control a match imo
[2023-01-04 17:28:34] <%$istreet98> When discussing clock stopping why do people only want 60 minutes of football? Rugby is 80 mins with clock stopping. Why don't we have the full 90 with stopping the clock
[2023-01-04 17:28:36] <%$alfiemayisthegoat> @AT000 I still can't get over how Chelsea got absolutely screwed in that Tottenham game LUL
[2023-01-04 17:28:45] <%+mattyjkellly> lol
[2023-01-04 17:28:48] <@%$ItsTr3ple> Discussing you discussing the game is pointless too, you'll do it anyway Kappa
[2023-01-04 17:28:54] <+kilvino> we watch football because of the game. not the ref. Thats is my experience anyway
[2023-01-04 17:28:54] <@%CaniSports> Nono sir, I bought him and he got the red now. The other one is on you
[2023-01-04 17:28:55] <WHIST1414> while poorly phrased, i think you might be taking he's statement literally, whereas he might have meant that what's happened happened.
[2023-01-04 17:28:57] <+grem1983> Fans of 'Big' clubs seem think Newcastle should just roll over and let them win
[2023-01-04 17:29:05] <+RazorKameo> LUL
[2023-01-04 17:29:06] <%$alfiemayisthegoat> Ball was in play for 43 minutes

[2023-01-04 17:29:15] <%+mattyjkellly> football swings in roundabouts tbf
[2023-01-04 17:29:16] <+josh__m19> imagine everyone walking out the stadium as a mute because you shouldn't discuss it when its done
[2023-01-04 17:29:18] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> @istreet98 Because football in general has 60 minutes of live ball time. Its what were used to. If they move it to 90 minutes it would take liek 3hours to finish every game
[2023-01-04 17:29:18] <%chrisdepot> Pope should‚Äôve gotten a yellow for the time wasting
[2023-01-04 17:29:18] <mgoat94> Course he has
[2023-01-04 17:29:20] <+eric_boro> The ref is a massive part of the game

[2023-01-04 17:29:21] <mattyav91> @rushisbad1852 There have been 48 VAR interventions during current Premier League season, with 42 correct and six deemed incorrect; Gabriel Martinelli's disallowed opener by VAR at United in September reportedly one of the errors.
[2023-01-04 17:29:22] <%+kingnovakin> Howe and all the fans came out and criticised us for it. But its just so hypocritical

[2023-01-04 17:29:31] <jack_russell67> goes to show how good arsenal are,Newcastle attack every1 and they came to us for a point
[2023-01-04 17:29:33] <%jonnyorr16> timewasting is still such a huge problem in the PL i thought when they said they would clamp down on it at the start of the season it would help, i dont know why they dont do like at the world cup
[2023-01-04 17:29:35] <%+thewalshman> Howe is full of crap

[2023-01-04 17:29:41] <%+Freddie14325> Nep the ball was out of play for 43 minutes throughout the whole game last night. Disgracful
[2023-01-04 17:29:41] <SHANEALEX91> the fact they've got VAR now and don't even use it annoys me
[2023-01-04 17:29:46] <+kilvino> I do occasionally. But mostly I think they are the boring part of football
[2023-01-04 17:29:53] <%brexitjamie> It was expected with Newcastle though they done it to Liverpool and got beat

[2023-01-04 17:29:54] <+kilvino> they are ususally subjective
[2023-01-04 17:29:56] <%+kingnovakin> we need World Cup style added time or to stop the clock

[2023-01-04 17:30:01] <stevemarshall01> Arsenal fan so might be biased but surely that hand ball in the last minute deserved a var check at the least ?
[2023-01-04 17:30:05] <+Jamie602> i think the added time in the world cup made the end of games more exciting, bring it to the prem
[2023-01-04 17:30:05] <%+biggestalph> I wonder if anyone has ever discussed if the ball was over the line in 66
[2023-01-04 17:30:05] <%+tall_liam> yeah but all teams time waste, its a part of the game unfortunetely. Should have been like world cup with games having 10+ stoppage time mins
[2023-01-04 17:30:05] <+tomtaz10> I know it's tough to handle, but the referee needed to take control of the game. Every foul that happened, the players were running up to him and complaining. Mostly Newcastle players tbh

[2023-01-04 17:31:17] <+plantedwharf545> @grem1983 Thats because that is what you have done when going to the big clubs, you cannot deny that. They still have a lot of respect and know you are good
[2023-01-04 17:31:20] <%krk0707> did nick pope get booked last night ?
[2023-01-04 17:31:20] <+RazorKameo> last season was 54 i think
[2023-01-04 17:31:21] <%+kingnovakin> @charliecole45 no problem bro
[2023-01-04 17:31:21] <%+MlKE_2023> 60 usually
[2023-01-04 17:31:22] <ThmsHrpr> average is around an hour
[2023-01-04 17:31:25] <jack_russell67> we need players if arteta looking at his bench last night and only brought on tomiyasu it's plain to see
[2023-01-04 17:31:26] <stevemarshall01> Arsenal fan so might be biased but surely that hand ball in the last minute deserved a var check at the least ?
[2023-01-04 17:31:33] <+jjmiles16> Easily 10
[2023-01-04 17:31:34] <monehsaudis> Newcastle have had goals dissallowed for no reason and the willock goal against Crystal Palace should of been allowed bad decisions will even themselves out over a season nep
[2023-01-04 17:31:36] <%caseymccabe13> The average is around 55 it‚Äôs not that bad but yes needs work
[2023-01-04 17:31:38] <%+pierce_23> id much rather a minimum time played because i do like time wasting it adds to the push of wanting to see a game out but equally they do take it too far
[2023-01-04 17:31:38] <+jda_unlockd> opta tweeted that it was in play for 51 mins, which is the 34the lowest in a premium game this season

[2023-01-04 17:32:31] <+ProfuseBasil18> they done it against Liverpool as well
[2023-01-04 17:32:31] <+benglennon123> It is quote sickening considering how much you pay to watch 90 mins of football and you don't even get 60 mins the majority of the time

[2023-01-04 17:32:44] <%+Luggsisluggs> time wasters only draft
[2023-01-04 17:32:45] <%$istreet98> @SpreadsheetFifa Rugby is 80 mins and is full of more stoppages but doesn't take much more then 80 90% of the time. You don't stop the clock every time it goes out, only for injuries and subs. Wouldn't be anywhere near 3 hours as that double the normal 90. It would just save adding 10-15 at the end
[2023-01-04 17:32:50] <%danthewolvesfan> Newcastle got away with not giving away a penalty
[2023-01-04 17:32:50] <+RedArmy411> @jack_russell67 whats wrong with that?
[2023-01-04 17:32:53] <%jonnyorr16> you will never get 90 minutes though
[2023-01-04 17:32:54] <gg13theking> bro league SBC is good I just pack duo ney ney and navas üòÑ
[2023-01-04 17:32:54] <mattysg8> fact of the matter is the level of referees at the elite level is just not good enough. we saw it at the WC
[2023-01-04 17:32:58] <%+MlKE_2023> This prem season is the most exciting for years though
[2023-01-04 17:33:00] <%$nelsonscolumn77> I agree with refs being told to not be as soft with fouls but hold someone back or holding their shirt should be penalised

[2023-01-04 17:33:11] <+RazorKameo> be longer than NFL at that point LUL
[2023-01-04 17:33:11] <%+deathskamikaze> nfl stop the clock, so a 60 minute game takes 3 hours
[2023-01-04 17:33:12] <+peeez9> they do in basketball and nfl
[2023-01-04 17:33:12] <%+futbolistic97> Yeah no, that's American football shit
[2023-01-04 17:33:13] <+kahnbayern> that var Thing should be removed
[2023-01-04 17:33:13] <%$alfiemayisthegoat> For fans, you pay for a ticket to watch a full game of football. Footballers dramatically reduce this time, so makes ticket prices seem even more ridiculous. People suggest doing it like rugby and stopping the clock, but then you get others saying 'its unfair' for footballers. Maybe if they didn't timewaste as much they do then it would be closer to 90
[2023-01-04 17:33:13] <%+pierce_23> make it a minimum of 80-85 mins played so some time wasting is okay
[2023-01-04 17:33:14] <+Cavacom> 4 hours for Madrid games
[2023-01-04 17:33:16] <%jonnyorr16> throw ins corners etc are part of the  game its fine if they take time just not obvious timewasting
[2023-01-04 17:33:17] <SHANEALEX91> stop the clock everytime the ball goes out but play only 30 mins a half.
[2023-01-04 17:33:25] <%+jokehereee> start penalising for time wasting

[2023-01-04 17:33:36] <+jjmiles16> They just need to count every minute wasted! It‚Äôs not that difficult we saw it at the World Cup
[2023-01-04 17:33:40] <%+Surrengar> that would be better tbh
[2023-01-04 17:33:40] <%jonnyorr16> that sounds awful
[2023-01-04 17:33:40] <%$istreet98> Thats what i mean. You dont stop the clock for every thrown in, full 90 but for subs/injuries only
[2023-01-04 17:33:40] <+kahnbayern> 3 corners 1 penaltyüòÇüòÇ
[2023-01-04 17:33:41] <%+jokehereee> 6 seconds to release from a throwing goalkick etc
[2023-01-04 17:33:41] <%+Brandez84> basketball is 48mins long, clock stops everytime it goes out n lasts over two hours
[2023-01-04 17:33:42] <mgoat94> Nah , that's called rugby üòÇüòÇüòÇ
[2023-01-04 17:33:43] <%+MlKE_2023> Would hate that
[2023-01-04 17:33:45] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> @istreet98 Right but injuries and subs are not what's being complained about. Its goal kicks, throw ins, free kicks. Essentially every dead ball. Thats why 60 is more accurate imo
[2023-01-04 17:33:45] <monehsaudis> Newcastle have had goals dissallowed for no reason and the willock goal against Crystal Palace should of been allowed bad decisions will even themselves out over a season nep I know it‚Äôs annoying but that‚Äôs var for you

[2023-01-04 17:36:41] <istreet98> I have a season ticket at Gloucester Rugby and honestly football could learn so much from how the execute the rules. TMO (aka VAR) is used so much better, Refs have mics, only speak to the captains, concussion subs. Its run so much more efficiently

[2023-01-04 18:07:02] <r1chstace> if done joe rogan style with an expert or well informed person on that particular topic that you have an interest in the conversation and information should carry itself
[2023-01-04 18:07:07] <@%Witchwalker70> Umtiti settling into Lecce life it seems
[2023-01-04 18:07:20] <%+Quilva> Skillz streams his Sticktalk but i wouldnt listen to it as a podcast
[2023-01-04 18:07:58] <%+Luggsisluggs> turn the draft to glory into the speed run channel and just general challenges to work towards
[2023-01-04 18:08:04] <+val_gur_1997> For a good podcast you need a good voice‚Ä¶
[2023-01-04 18:08:22] <+Jamie602> draft speed run would just be to afk 10 offline games
[2023-01-04 18:08:24] <@%Viperlization> speedruns and shareplays
[2023-01-04 18:08:28] <@%Viperlization> perfect for nep 2
[2023-01-04 18:08:28] <Stallone986> shareplays are always banter
[2023-01-04 18:08:33] <%+Luggsisluggs> neps got a decent talking voice XD

[2023-01-04 18:08:37] <%+MlKE_2023> Would you ever do a speed run on something else like career mode, pro clubs etc
[2023-01-04 18:08:55] <mattysg8> the unban requests are a work of art üòÇ
[2023-01-04 18:08:56] <jezfi> Player review videos are very over saturated tbh
[2023-01-04 18:09:15] <+Cavacom> he are some podcast topics i would be super interested in: direction of Fifa content, the life of a streamer/youtuber, deciding to purchase a Lambo, etc
[2023-01-04 18:09:15] <@sorarejosh> weirdly unban vids would probs get more views on 2nd
[2023-01-04 18:09:18] <%krk0707> nep who does your thumbnails on yt
[2023-01-04 18:09:23] <+val_gur_1997> @luke44999 for a better life you can‚Äôt be named ‚ÄúLuke‚Äù
[2023-01-04 18:09:24] <%blazer33x> i do like the way you explain 6pm content
[2023-01-04 18:09:26] <spicy_nugget6> I agree nep. I like the long videos where you show how you grind the game. If you can implement that once a week. That would be great
[2023-01-04 18:09:29] <%+Th1sSecretN1nj4> also you could move stuff that bangs on Nep 2 to main. like promotion style, do well you get moved up?
[2023-01-04 18:09:34] <spicy_nugget6> Love you bye since fifa 15
[2023-01-04 18:09:59] <Stallone986> fortnite games talking real ball instead of sit down podcast. Bring in guests like miniminter
[2023-01-04 18:10:23] <@%Viperlization> do you reckon the 4 hr speedrun would've done half as well on the main?
[2023-01-04 18:10:24] <%+Luggsisluggs> what channel gets the most attention
[2023-01-04 18:10:29] <mr_bossfc1> My club is gonna feel so empty today when all they remove all the wc players LUL
[2023-01-04 18:10:35] <+shortstakked> So like the 4 hour rtg you could do it 20 times on the channel but that would just be the same thing over and over again

[2023-01-04 18:10:42] <%+adaker175> I like the longer videos, put them on in the morning when I giving my daughter breakfast
[2023-01-04 18:10:48] <yeb71> maybe you can do a once a week a high quality 30-40 min vid
[2023-01-04 18:10:50] <@%Viperlization> yeah
[2023-01-04 18:11:27] <%+pierce_23> FUT champs rewards was class
[2023-01-04 18:11:31] <@%Viperlization> you defo could still do that
[2023-01-04 18:11:35] <+pringle94> would you not consider moving the Draft To Glory back to the main channel so your not having to worry about getting a draft out every day
[2023-01-04 18:11:35] <@%Viperlization> not sure it'd do so well
[2023-01-04 18:11:36] <%+Luggsisluggs> unless you do a danny aarons and spend a grand every day, not really ideal
[2023-01-04 18:11:37] <pxqueta> will you do a rtg this fifa or is that idea gone now?
[2023-01-04 18:11:39] <+MWSavage> I consider myself a good FIFA player , always do well , but I always give up early goals within the first 10 mins , any tips I‚Äôm always playing catch-up to win
[2023-01-04 18:11:41] <@%Viperlization> maybe try it this weekend
[2023-01-04 18:11:44] <@%Viperlization> with the new rewards
[2023-01-04 18:11:45] <%joebellis67> like the videos wouldn't get the amount of views if you didnt explain the content how he you do, props to you nep
[2023-01-04 18:11:48] <%m3elv1n> remember MM on tuesdays
[2023-01-04 18:11:49] <%+Metcalfe11> i feel like  'best of' content does really well for lots of people and ive never seen short videos like 5-15 mins of people doing like a 'best of nepenthez week 1 2023' and it just being a video of clipped together funny/intresting or good achievements etc be a good way for people to recap good moments or just catch up n stuff you have done each week
[2023-01-04 18:12:00] <+LincsyTTV> Do miss the reward vids but dont think there as popular anymore
[2023-01-04 18:12:03] <$frasermc_> muslera CS already gone
[2023-01-04 18:12:04] <$frasermc_> nice
[2023-01-04 18:12:05] <+jrossino> I like Matt gamer but his content is so lazy
[2023-01-04 18:12:14] <+jrossino> It‚Äôs almost cheeky
[2023-01-04 18:12:14] <%+MlKE_2023> Rashford potm incoming btw
[2023-01-04 18:12:21] <@%Viperlization> thats actually a good point
[2023-01-04 18:12:23] <+pringle94> i understand that may remove a revenue stream in way of the DTG channel but it may drive move views to the main channel and improve the revenue on there
[2023-01-04 18:12:28] <%+adaker175> @MlKE_2023 that confirmed?
[2023-01-04 18:12:36] <%krk0707> I'm out nep have a good one neppoLove

[2023-01-04 18:13:28] <%$billybb> I‚Äôd love the player reviews l, your opinion on the game has weight
[2023-01-04 18:13:35] <%+pierce_23> you can happily rate my team LUL
[2023-01-04 18:13:44] <%+MlKE_2023> @adaker175 nah but honestly don‚Äôt think anyone else has done better than him 2 wins 2 goals and a assist
[2023-01-04 18:14:04] <%blazer33x> you have 3 channels?
[2023-01-04 18:14:12] <%+Luggsisluggs> ive noticed you are capguntoms kryptonite for views they always bang

[2023-01-04 18:14:20] <%+adaker175> @MlKE_2023 Completely agree
[2023-01-04 18:14:32] <%+heresthett> most people don't watch fifa gameplay because they don't even enjoy playing it

[2023-01-04 18:14:44] <+JakeHann7> it also doesnt help that the trending "gaming" tab is never really gaming, if you're wearing a headset and reacting, it often hits the gaming tab

[2023-01-04 18:15:28] <%+bongyyyyy> I would rather watch a hour league sbc run then 5 champs games tbf
[2023-01-04 18:15:30] <Stallone986> maybe next years game might bring in tons of views

[2023-01-04 18:17:28] <grantmc23> 45 mins
[2023-01-04 18:17:29] <%$itsthatja> 44-46mins after ads
[2023-01-04 18:17:29] <WHIST1414> sitcoms still run for ~20-23 minutes though
[2023-01-04 18:17:31] <spears453> @jimmybrook06 how are you
[2023-01-04 18:17:33] <%$arrowgaminghd34> my partner watches korean dramas and they are 1 hour 15 minutes no ads
[2023-01-04 18:17:34] <%$BobbyTambling> 40 minutes is standard
[2023-01-04 18:17:35] <oxjacksonx> draft to save to bank put cash code on the line depending what round you get kicked out bet that would add views
[2023-01-04 18:17:40] <%$sheesh1000> Depends, sitcoms like friends still short
[2023-01-04 18:17:44] <%+mikekozy23> wednesday were all like 55 mins
[2023-01-04 18:17:49] <%+heresthett> a lot of the time people watch things while doing other things, so longer things are necessary which you don't need to focus on as much
[2023-01-04 18:17:55] <Stallone986> float or sink
[2023-01-04 18:17:56] <%jakehall0762> I have a firestick so that's how I watch most of my shows
[2023-01-04 18:18:01] <spears453> @vendra_2 he‚Äôs already done it I think
[2023-01-04 18:18:01] <gg13theking> Josh is so professional
[2023-01-04 18:18:08] <+pringle94> may sound like a money grab but would you not do a day where you go through viewer squads for say 200-500 bits on stream and put them into a video? or even just do it through share play without bits so people dont see it as a cash grab. i think because of how many good players there are this year i see varied teams far more than any other year and its cool to not see the same 5/6 players in every team
[2023-01-04 18:18:22] <+bavz29> thats gonna be me soon :(

[2023-01-04 18:39:26] <+sjm501> "Fearing the worst" - You said that EA will definitely fuck up the WC rewards in someway so thats def true.

[2023-01-04 18:39:44] <@%Viperlization> is there help for it?

[2023-01-04 18:41:27] <mickao7> anxiety for me at least can be so tough
[2023-01-04 18:41:35] <%jakehall0762> I think being around the right people helps you a lot as you can come more out of your shadow compared to people you don't know
[2023-01-04 18:41:46] <%+teasyy_tom> we all have mental health wether good or bad... wether long or short term.
[2023-01-04 18:41:53] <elzfletch03> Optimal level of anxiety has something to do with the inverted u theory i think
[2023-01-04 18:42:04] <%eatburgers1> its as important as physical health and can absolutely be dehabilitating, yet some people still have a mindset that you can simply "snap out of it"
[2023-01-04 18:42:09] <Stallone986> good thing we see more occupational therapist then

[2023-01-04 18:46:19] <+crotzer2010> Social media both helps and ruins mental health.
[2023-01-04 18:46:21] <+AverySnipedYou> agree with all this stuff...... found my friend a few years back... can't get help because I'm not sad enough for extreme therapy but the regular therapy says I'm not too sad.... I'm in a decent spot now but i got no help... the stigma is more there then ever before although they say it isn't..... most people just want it swept under the rug..... I suffer with depression and anxiety on a small scale but my life will never be the same because of what i saw february 28 2018...

[2023-01-04 18:54:03] <securitymayhem> IMO, Listening is the key. Allowing people to vent without giving a opinion can allow them to find the conclusion

[2023-01-04 18:54:33] <%$BobbyTambling> so when you ban someone for being toxic and you give him a few minutes of fame, even though we don't talk about him anymore do you still think about it while the stream is going?

[2023-01-04 19:31:42] <+AnthonyJ1988> Why do some World Cup players have a green triangle and some a timer on them?
[2023-01-04 19:31:42] <Dannyel2709> What should we do with WORLD cup players? Just quick sell them?
[2023-01-04 19:31:44] <%johnthegg> seems right for nep's rewards
[2023-01-04 19:31:44] <+donsblonsje> Surely wait to open rewards when the centurions promo is here right?

[2023-01-04 19:34:30] <here4rewards_> at this point I am saving for TOTY, realistically my team is good enough for 16 wins for the rest of the game, only cards that upgrade it are the TOTYs.
[2023-01-04 19:34:34] <%+Brandez84> Generally think Opta struggle massively with mistaken identity spmetimes

[2023-01-04 20:03:17] <hughesy44> my best pack pulls have been from league sbc grinds which would have been nowhere near a rewards time or 6pm
[2023-01-04 20:03:18] <@%+Owen_Slater> An unreasonable percentage of my good pack pulls have been late at night, compared with the percentage of packs I open late night
[2023-01-04 20:03:20] <r1chstace> I have said this for a number of years a disproportionate amount of my big pulls over the years have come and crazy hours
[2023-01-04 20:03:20] <JaySsack> I pulled TOTY CR7 and prime Cruyff in fifa21 both at like midnight EST, so like 5AM UK
[2023-01-04 20:03:20] <EminentScalar> this is 100% all my best packs come very late European time

[2023-01-04 20:03:22] <%Joshilh98> Yeah I open my toty packs late in the uk time. Avoid 6pm cos everyone will be opening then

[2023-01-04 20:03:24] <+djclear88> I makes sense to be fair, I got my toty Ronaldo at 12M on fifa 22 and go winter Jesus last night at 1am
[2023-01-04 20:03:25] <+philmartins123> I remember I packs neymar first day of fifa at around 2 am
[2023-01-04 20:03:26] <%+Lucky9631> two fifa's ago i would only open icon packs between 11pm and like 4am... hit 2 versions of pele, r9, eusebio and puskas... anything before like 10pm would be shitters
[2023-01-04 20:03:26] <%whufcconnor> time zones though, people will be opening packs all day

[2023-01-04 20:03:36] <%exclusive457> but with that theory, people will now open packs when no one else is and the new time to open packs is when they were but now arent, and that time will keep swapping
[2023-01-04 20:03:39] <@%Viperlization> Did that file go elsewhere again

[2023-01-04 20:03:43] <%+mikekozy23> @Gworv bc it's not falsely advertised, the store pack probabilities say "at x:xx time" not "at all times"
[2023-01-04 20:03:47] <LawsonJP> i packed toty ronaldo at 2am the last day of toty last year
[2023-01-04 20:03:47] <+healtheekid> 9pm est
[2023-01-04 20:03:47] <+joshy32> there's no factual evidence or statistics to back up your theory nep
[2023-01-04 20:03:48] <+xochubbzox> I agree with nep my pack luck has always been late at night I can't pack shit in the day
[2023-01-04 20:03:48] <yungmaseyy> Now everyone‚Äôs gonna nick my grabs at 3am üò°üò°üò°
[2023-01-04 20:03:48] <%JWISEY249799> i will say, at 6pm my luck is alwasy horrible, but between 2am-6am, i have got almost always all of my good pulls
[2023-01-04 20:03:49] <%+Deck81> I always remember you saying we should open packs late at night
[2023-01-04 20:03:50] <ovowalt> i agree with you i think its a percentage chance so more people less likely 1/100 vs 10/1000 etc
[2023-01-04 20:03:53] <%sinkycod> I packed mid maldini last year from a 7.5k pack at 3am lol
[2023-01-04 20:03:54] <%+always_rainy98> i presume they make the weight lower at 6pm as if a good promo card is packed at the same the price would be set extremely low from the start?
[2023-01-04 20:03:57] <Brett_Crack> he didnt get fired, his contract was up.
[2023-01-04 20:03:58] <+kcouper7> open packs on fifa 22 and see if it works no one opening packs there now?
[2023-01-04 20:03:59] <%+N8_FUT> Live in the US and late night here early UK time is crazy
[2023-01-04 20:03:59] <%+ikester213> but there will always be people awake playing fifa right ?
[2023-01-04 20:03:59] <+tsgator2001> Agree 100 percent my pack luck is so much better when everyone else is holding packs
[2023-01-04 20:04:00] <vinigem> that's not how program is written
[2023-01-04 20:04:01] <harlam03akaaaron> does this theory change with cross play on
[2023-01-04 20:04:01] <+mozzaonstix> i packed toty mbappe like 7pm or sum bs
[2023-01-04 20:04:01] <AbdulTarar> @hopelessscrew he didnt get fired....
[2023-01-04 20:04:02] <%coops1871> is there not a theory that pack weight is based on the card value on the market
[2023-01-04 20:04:02] <+lhunty> When I had my injury I mainly played fifa through the night whilst kids asleep and I packed LOADS now I‚Äôm working I ain‚Äôt packed shit
[2023-01-04 20:04:04] <MaliBoomZAR> so NA people have better pack luck? explains why Zwe's RTG is always OP
[2023-01-04 20:04:07] <%+bazzay10> I always say the 2 rare gold upgrade packs are better after 10 at night
[2023-01-04 20:04:09] <%$nightfly89> but night in eu means day in us and now a lot of players play in both north and south America

[2023-01-04 20:04:40] <+joshy32> no one knows how it works, it's all speculation - there's no evidence to support your theory either
[2023-01-04 20:04:41] <%+KapzeMcLovin> Nep, a sorare question: Do you get rewards after every game period? Like after the one from 3-6/1 and 6-10/1? Or is it just once from those two rounds?
[2023-01-04 20:04:47] <+HoldYerTaters> Reyna's mother confirmed it
[2023-01-04 20:04:49] <+smokeymcpot_99> Didn‚Äôt the USA coach kick his wife?
[2023-01-04 20:04:50] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> Nah, Greg Berhalter, the coach, had to come out and say hed kicked his wife when they were teenagers like 32 years ago. He was being blackmailed by Gio Reynas mum with the info.
[2023-01-04 20:04:51] <maddogthejr> Packs are algorithm based so it‚Äôs not dependent upon when you open them
[2023-01-04 20:04:52] <AbdulTarar> he didnt get fired, that guy is lying
[2023-01-04 20:04:52] <Brett_Crack> he didnt get resigned an surely wont now

[2023-01-04 20:04:53] <+electricksabers> he didnt get fired, his contract expired 12-31

[2023-01-04 20:05:35] <@%+Owen_Slater> The code has got to be written in a way where there has to be a minimum amount of say "icons" per period of time. At 6pm, theres more. But at 3am, probs not enough to fill quota
