[2022-12-08 00:35:35] <@^Nightbot> You buy/farm a set of Death or Light and Truth divination cards that gives a unique scepter. You make new level 4 character. You turn in the set on it. You vaal the scepter in the hopes it turns rare. You get other 4 rare bases of the same scepter by casually playing the game. Vendor them with the one you corrupted into a rare. Then you get a rare ilvl 4 Rare clean scepter. How to craft. On average you need 16 scorch fossils to get +1 fire and fire dot multi. - Oct0_Pus

[2022-12-08 16:06:33] <LoganLuther> I was gonna play and league start RF. But being muted for something extremely stupid has left a sour taste. GGG treats their customers like shit.
[2022-12-08 16:06:53] <zanthren> So Jugg is new way to RF? I did your RF inquis in 3.18, but took a break in 3.19
[2022-12-08 16:06:56] <@%donavanshepard> not a whole lot, gonna do that later today

[2022-12-08 16:52:23] <+teufeltal> hey Pohx, I know you're not into uber-bossing, but do you think RF jugg can pull off 40/40 challenges in Sanctum (which will for sure include some ubers)?
[2022-12-08 16:52:53] <drdoppler2k> @teufeltal yes ofc
[2022-12-08 16:53:06] <eraInferno> You can just buy challenge completions
[2022-12-08 16:53:12] <wafflerrrr> i did 40/40 last league with jugg and inquis
[2022-12-08 16:53:16] <wafflerrrr> so it is possible
[2022-12-08 16:53:21] <249洛奇亞 (249lugia)> does rf good for those spore maps?
[2022-12-08 16:53:32] <+m0rdekaiser_> @LePapaZipo97407 they already answered tons of questions - https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/3324388
[2022-12-08 16:53:33] <cebero1> you should be able to get enough currency with the RF in order to gear an uber killer char
[2022-12-08 16:53:41] <Morenizel> THis one looks so intence
[2022-12-08 16:53:56] <+teufeltal> @wafflerrrr nice. Killed ubers yourself?
[2022-12-08 16:54:06] <LePapaZipo97407> @m0rdekaiser_ i ever look it ^^
[2022-12-08 16:54:06] <+doc5482> can RF jugg tank the exarch ball phase? always have an issue with it. or anyone have other suggestions?
[2022-12-08 16:54:11] <5folingen> did they rush to act 10 before they started or are they doing all acts aswell?
[2022-12-08 16:54:13] <eraInferno> @cebero1 that's my plan, rf til voidforge
[2022-12-08 16:54:17] <tommycheaw> i just start back, i gonna try jugg this coming sanctum

[2022-12-08 16:54:22] <siko402> so what's your opinion on socketing volcanic fissure for early levling for jugg
[2022-12-08 16:54:22] <Krazzed324> just the level 60 lake always makes me laugh
[2022-12-08 16:54:23] <+m0rdekaiser_> @LePapaZipo97407 everything else we will discover by playing, they teased a lot in their website, but u still can check on twitter/reddit too (that megathread)
[2022-12-08 16:54:43] <bigearthquakeisrael> so to do jugg as league start we need to level templar to lvl4 for skills?
[2022-12-08 16:54:44] <LePapaZipo97407> ok thx ^^
[2022-12-08 16:54:45] <cebero1> @eraInferno on what build?
[2022-12-08 16:54:48] <axel1v9> did u decide if ur gonna drop an inq updated video guide this league?
[2022-12-08 16:54:52] <wafflerrrr> @teufeltal yh was just a little slow compared to other builds ofc  but you can do it if you know the mechanics of each fight
[2022-12-08 16:54:58] <cebero1> @eraInferno just curious
[2022-12-08 16:55:04] <+erkjrm> Hi, thank you for the RF guides! Are your 3.19 filters usable for 3.20 ?
[2022-12-08 16:55:09] <+m0rdekaiser_> @wafflerrrr ubers can be soloed, but investmet is above the leaguestarter build
[2022-12-08 16:55:13] <+PrantasQQ> @Pohx  Love your RF build really!! What do you think about the new Volcanic fissure skill? I would wanna try to get ubers done with it kinda risky to start but with the new atziri axe might be much fun
[2022-12-08 16:55:16] <bigearthquakeisrael> is it efficient or just the way you like it :D?
[2022-12-08 16:55:20] <siko402> inquisitor remains the same just no conc effect
[2022-12-08 16:55:23] <eraInferno> @cebero1 waiting to see what ends up meta tbh, probably cyclone or flicker strike

[2022-12-08 16:57:12] <bigearthquakeisrael> Do you have any ideas on how the new league mechanic will work with RF?

[2022-12-08 16:58:40] <%+TheAfty> I really want a filter with the currency sounds in where it speaks the currency type.

[2022-12-08 16:58:44] <%+arnoldzgreat> BalorMage has basic loot filters which is pretty good even though generic.

[2022-12-08 17:46:09] <+flawedHumanBro> Agreed, using hydrosphere was clunky for LC so eventually went with Storm brand

[2022-12-08 17:46:21] <addicted_exile> ice nova + frost bolt would probably be better, ya
[2022-12-08 17:46:21] <MushramboVGC> cwc is much cheaper than coc, thats why pohx is talking about that - i think.
[2022-12-08 17:46:23] <addicted_exile> even self-cast
[2022-12-08 17:46:23] <leviky69> @Pohx when it comes to jugg vs inquis.. doesnt juggs unyielding at 6-7 charges actually equal more damage than inquis differential?
[2022-12-08 17:46:24] <+zehkal> I use cast while channeling :)

[2022-12-08 17:46:59] <+SalteeBoii> I got a tabaula doing a practice run yesterday, vaal'd it cuz I didn't care if it bricked and it rolled +49% increased damage. RIP my league start rng sad he
[2022-12-08 17:46:59] <addicted_exile> I did a hydrosphere main but I did it as an archmage heiro with indigon.   I think that's better overall than occultist.

[2022-12-08 17:47:55] <Mr_n2mu> @Pohx what is better spell block or spell suppression?
[2022-12-08 17:47:55] <+Sylphid88> only on inquis
[2022-12-08 17:48:00] <+Sylphid88> or the flask
[2022-12-08 17:48:00] <Eludi> well, forbidden jewels do give multiplier, I guess

[2022-12-08 17:48:24] <leviky69> but bottled faith takes away that conc ground difference...and pious doesnt give the + anymore so jugg has same conc?

[2022-12-08 17:49:06] <+Ashcroftt> Can you get full ailment immune on inquisitor? Tried it for a day before league end and really struggled with DoTs on Aegis
[2022-12-08 17:49:12] <+clondike7> also, Jugg won't have 100% Conc ground via flasks; Inq will
[2022-12-08 17:49:16] <Yurachka> do you setup Elementalist RF  somewhen?
[2022-12-08 17:49:21] <da1gon> are u gonna do another build later league? ore
[2022-12-08 17:49:23] <vietbeo2212> @turok__ i think as casual player should play mapping build first then farm curr for bossing char later

[2022-12-08 17:49:59] <Rybsson> @leviky69 you can have conc ground on jugg even with sulfur flask. the difference is, inquisitor has 'conc ground applies increased dmg taken' on ascendancy
[2022-12-08 17:50:03] <+n64overclocked> oh man i cant wait to try jugg this league. i really dont want to have to deal with all the reconfiguring when switching to melding

[2022-12-08 17:53:21] <staz_____> i have a question regarding pohxs rf jugg which he does not answer on his website.  if you get to the point of melding you struggle alot with resitances on gear. permanent endurance charges would help solve that but the problem is there is no reliable way to really have 100% uptime in his build you get some if you get hit yes but you dont really wanna get hit before your res is capped through charges is there a way besides the body armor mod that generates endurance charges? (in his build he is
[2022-12-08 17:53:23] <%+Mr_Titan253> my prediction, the intended mechanic of distance-scaled resolve loss won't work at launch and melee will get disproportionately destroyed. it'll be fixed in week 2

[2022-12-08 18:05:51] <bigdiddy09> That might be console peice
[2022-12-08 18:05:56] <bigdiddy09> Price*
[2022-12-08 18:05:57] <Doubrol> i was coutning the enchant ye
[2022-12-08 18:05:58] <xtotalityx> @Pohx no ESS on kirac = more spensive RF helms?
[2022-12-08 18:06:01] <siko402> that's a 3 div helmet
[2022-12-08 18:06:02] <iizowenzii> couple essences and a craft 30  div?
[2022-12-08 18:06:02] <mrvhite0> i think thats max 1 div and that depends of the price of the essence
[2022-12-08 18:06:06] <amirius10> ty <3
[2022-12-08 18:06:07] <$afters_shocks> maybe with conc effecburning damage
[2022-12-08 18:06:10] <EnigmaOC> anybody familiar with steel skills? have some question bout those nu gloves Entropic Devastation.
[2022-12-08 18:06:10] <Rybsson> +2 aoe adds 6ish div on avarage to cost
[2022-12-08 18:06:14] <+hoerlahu3> dude probably got 30div standard not league
[2022-12-08 18:06:18] <Rybsson> so it's more like 8-9 div helmet
[2022-12-08 18:06:19] <BubuTroN> 5 to 10 div max
[2022-12-08 18:06:25] <mrvhite0> 5 div
[2022-12-08 18:06:29] <yalkman> im a noob at crafting and made that helm. not 30 div

[2022-12-08 18:06:44] <+LightcallerTV> Its also the 96+ gear set... like thats not the "beginner friendly" gear
[2022-12-08 18:06:44] <Ahmose_> buy elder base and spam essences till you hit 2 required mods and 2 acceptale mods duh
[2022-12-08 18:06:48] <BubuTroN> 30 div with conc and burning maybe
[2022-12-08 18:07:00] <%+Mr_Titan253> if you make it to this point in a league then you should know enough about how to get this gear and moreso what you do and do not need
[2022-12-08 18:07:03] <%+xxflyonfirexx> i made a helm like this in mayhem ssf
[2022-12-08 18:07:10] <%+Asterysm> 96 is gonna be a fair bit of time and money made, right?
[2022-12-08 18:07:12] <leviky69> A 7L helm is expensive even to craft... not a 6L

[2022-12-08 18:18:26] <Doubrol> i still think getting the +2 on a enchant helm is expensive, what i didn;t take into account is selling the usuable stuff you get along the way

[2022-12-08 18:19:11] <+LightcallerTV> Even if the enchant and the helm is expensive. its ONLY in the 96+ gear set
[2022-12-08 18:19:16] <niceplayer69> why does the helmet have to be elder influenced? @Pohx
[2022-12-08 18:19:16] <M3t6> really enjoying the emulator examples.  this is great!
[2022-12-08 18:19:22] <Forseak> I didn't even enchant my helmet last league and I was fine
[2022-12-08 18:19:23] <%+Asterysm> 96+ is endgame, and should be considered as such

[2022-12-08 18:32:04] <aedirne> @kaiwyass OK proper explanation: There are maps in the end game where the boss of them is replaced by an "Elder Guardian". These maps are known as Elder-influenced. In these maps, items can naturally drop with Elder influence, with the Elder guardian themself having a much higher chance to drop these items. There are other sources too, like the Elder himself

[2022-12-08 18:35:11] <dighno89> doing alt Spam will end up being more expensive to finish after that and you also miss damage from the horror essence. Also the mods arent too hard to hit

[2022-12-08 18:37:55] <davidlbowman> @Pohx , I've gone through your guide, and you suggest taking Unstoppable for "Cannot be Stunned." Why not get "Unwavering Stance" for two points if it's so important?
[2022-12-08 18:37:57] <Svetliaka92> You can probably also farm harbis for fracture orbs, fracture either T1 loathing or horror, and then slam the helm with the other essence :D

[2022-12-08 18:43:00] <njn2> @akavuuh oh, you're probably right yea, they used give that file earlier. But at the same time, I don't think you need that file to update pob with the current available info, give people chance to calculate damage with the new curses, we already know how curses work

[2022-12-08 18:45:08] <%lemoncoolers> @iwannadobadthingswithu RF is a more multiplier for spell damage
[2022-12-08 18:45:13] <dalwand> Can you make an Über RF char by pooling items

[2022-12-08 18:46:11] <%+pnxRaul> can you explain how Unbreakable  works please
[2022-12-08 18:46:14] <+zapH2O> and fashion is important
[2022-12-08 18:46:14] <+SeleneSWE> and its usuyally vendor trash for most ppl
[2022-12-08 18:46:28] <+TheoBr0mine> whats the best league mechanic for currency farming with RF builds?
[2022-12-08 18:46:28] <+Turtle69> RF is a dream to play, very low stress even if it doesn't have the highest DPS.    The biggest QOL benefit it that you can collect loot off the ground while still dealing DPS to the monsters.
[2022-12-08 18:46:33] <Kimurriel> BTW thanks for the absolute beast of a guide. you're appreciated!

[2022-12-08 18:46:49] <+Ajdepual> I recomend Delve
[2022-12-08 18:46:50] <+SeleneSWE> expedition and harbingers is what imma do this league
[2022-12-08 18:46:50] <%lemoncoolers> @pnxRaul after mitigation, the elemental damage you take is reduced by a flat amount based on your armor.
[2022-12-08 18:46:52] <+Ajdepual> and u sell maps
[2022-12-08 18:46:55] <+Ajdepual> and fossils
[2022-12-08 18:47:02] <+TheoBr0mine> @SeleneSWE I was thinking the same
[2022-12-08 18:47:03] <dalwand> I saw a video of pure ES (15k) RF - in standard. Is that clickbait or viable?
[2022-12-08 18:47:04] <+Ajdepual> for RF
[2022-12-08 18:47:07] <+Akinau> is there any specific uniques we should get
[2022-12-08 18:47:08] <dighno89> you need skill to do ubers

[2022-12-08 18:47:08] <bewl> Expedition for me this last league was -super- lucrative
[2022-12-08 18:47:10] <zap_angelo> is rf jugg viable for pinnacle bosses?

[2022-12-08 18:47:50] <+zapH2O> I like how unbreakable helps with spike dmg

[2022-12-08 18:55:00] <Yacuy> @Bibouuuuuuuuu the more complex is your board the more INT they generate
[2022-12-08 18:55:05] <!%+Jadeon77> Very Sadge  they took out the ability to prepend my char names with ㆍJDㆍ like have for the past many many many leagues =/

[2022-12-08 18:55:10] <+Turtle69> is there a trick to get your Stash setup to be copied over to the next league?  I've been trying for 3 leagues to do it, but it never happens.

[2022-12-08 19:18:21] <Dremmestar> Makes sense
[2022-12-08 19:18:26] <caracachimba> can this build do breaches and legion good?
[2022-12-08 19:18:31] <Cyber_Exile> i think tyty is looking at everything from a racing pov
[2022-12-08 19:18:36] <+krelium_taken> He says that jugg is for bad/new people
[2022-12-08 19:18:37] <%theredsaylor> there are manyy other builds that are betterr at the thing they are made for, jug str stacker? objectively better

[2022-12-08 19:19:26] <%oscar111> jugg RF is not great, it's amazing
[2022-12-08 19:19:28] <+zapH2O> pretty sure that Tyty would defer to Pohx in anything RF related lol
[2022-12-08 19:19:30] <+Turtle69> not many builds that are better for pickup up loot than RF.
[2022-12-08 19:19:32] <+mastermenno078> i got deffences but no dmg
[2022-12-08 19:19:36] <+IceDivel> mules are for giving skills that you should get early on for another char
[2022-12-08 19:19:41] <+FatRat_> Jugg's only downside seems to be early game boss damage, but you still can kill the bosses
[2022-12-08 19:19:46] <%theredsaylor> so many essences

[2022-12-08 20:50:59] <YeAhx69> @KIeinesEi city square bosses are those 3 in centre of it if im not wrong. well just run through them and keep circling ig. Just like how it is for every boss

[2022-12-08 20:51:52] <ceLaguna> @Pohx First time starting RF probs. What other Jugg or Inq build would you recommend to transition into for bossing later on?

[2022-12-08 20:51:54] <+TheoBr0mine> do you play HC? I am new
[2022-12-08 20:51:56] <%+gawk> RF is the best map walking simulator build

[2022-12-08 20:52:31] <+TheoBr0mine> cool. I dislike HC tbh. feels too bad when death inevitably happens

[2022-12-08 20:54:23] <Vileguy> the bigger the requirement, the more likely to get that color

[2022-12-08 20:58:17] <+vitorivescf> Is there a way to target farm a specific Unique item? The few times i played i just bought from other players what i needed but this time i want to go SSF.
[2022-12-08 20:58:21] <DoomGuy_dot> @krogodaxl_joe on the wiki, it's generally worse but it is kind've a substitute if you really don't like fire trap

[2022-12-08 21:01:31] <+vitorivescf> Sorry about the noob question but Is it possible to target farm Unique items you need in PoE?
[2022-12-08 21:01:33] <Svetliaka92> TheoBr0mine ele weakness is great, since RF doesn't pen. Despair with quality will be also good for the inc damage taken from dots
[2022-12-08 21:01:34] <Hillgrove> Have you ever pushed RF to mirror tier DPS youself?
[2022-12-08 21:01:34] <%theredsaylor> staff sucks
[2022-12-08 21:01:39] <%+yomenss> Whats the most dps you've had on RF ?
[2022-12-08 21:01:43] <%lemoncoolers> @vitorivescf depends on the item
[2022-12-08 21:01:46] <+TheoBr0mine> @lemoncoolers @Svetliaka92 alright thanks
[2022-12-08 21:02:13] <krogodaxl_joe> how good of a weapon would searing touch be for staff variant? (/jugg?)
[2022-12-08 21:02:15] <+m0rdekaiser_> @TheoBr0mine flamm + ele weakness
[2022-12-08 21:02:20] <%lemoncoolers> @krogodaxl_joe PoB
[2022-12-08 21:02:27] <+vitorivescf> @vitorivescf Oh, thank you. Got it.
[2022-12-08 21:02:35] <YozukaYT> what time is the patch?
[2022-12-08 21:02:44] <%lemoncoolers> @YozukaYT pathofexile.com
[2022-12-08 21:02:48] <warchiefbruiser> @pohx since ele dmg is a bigger issue than phys for jugg, do u consider 5-6 points for saffel + max spell block a waste in hc?
[2022-12-08 21:02:54] <eraInferno> If you go staff, go mirror tier rare or kulemak only
[2022-12-08 21:03:12] <YozukaYT> @YozukaYT I see. thanks!
[2022-12-08 21:03:26] <TeiTV> what ascendancy passive you would drop on Jugg in Ruthless ?

[2022-12-08 21:03:32] <+Wafflestein> searing could be alright to hold you over until you get a good staff but eh
[2022-12-08 21:03:39] <+macros86> Hey chat, can I use holy flame totem to level with Jugg? I didn't like levelling with rolling magma
[2022-12-08 21:03:40] <+BEEF__TV> would you recommend SSF to players who've never got to T16 maps? or better to stick to tradeleague?
[2022-12-08 21:03:53] <%+Noctvurnal> @pohx does jugg really care about block?
[2022-12-08 21:03:55] <+Maravilhouso> @Pohx jugg rf is able to do the feared? played rf jug long time ago
[2022-12-08 21:03:56] <%lemoncoolers> @macros86 yes but it's less damage than rolling. I recommend getting used to rolling magma.
[2022-12-08 21:03:57] <+Wafflestein> yea that's fair
[2022-12-08 21:04:09] <%lemoncoolers> @BEEF__TV if it seems fun to you, do it.

[2022-12-08 21:04:47] <+TheoBr0mine> yeah, it makes sense
[2022-12-08 21:04:48] <%+gawk> @Pohx During Kalandra, you did a restart on SSF for RF_Jugg. What do you think your going to do this time around on your mid league restart?

[2022-12-08 21:05:41] <TeiTV> is it because you have no interest playing Ruthless at all or just not played yet?
[2022-12-08 21:05:43] [Notification] Booncetv subscribed with Prime.
[2022-12-08 21:05:46] <Svetliaka92> warchiefbruiser the event unique shield was busted, so not going block was a waste :)
[2022-12-08 21:05:50] <+TheCrazedBanana> @Pohx 2 leagues ago I think you were doing something in the acts for RF crafts.
[2022-12-08 21:05:51] <%lemoncoolers> @warchiefbruiser deep delving is a different beast. People who deep delve build their characters specifically for deep delve and deep delve only.
[2022-12-08 21:05:52] <eraInferno> @warchiefbruiser why are you comparing delve infinite event to trade league
[2022-12-08 21:05:54] <MetaMaxs> i had much joy playing rf last season short question did it get nerfed in any way ?
[2022-12-08 21:05:55] <Rutgrr> do you alch and go ?
[2022-12-08 21:06:01] <Dremichius> I found the answer to my question on the wiki - +1 All Fire Gems (assume around 70% Increase or about 20% Multi)
[2022-12-08 21:06:08] <%Divio> @pohx linked a YouTube video yesterday that had a PoB leveling checklist. looks like they turned it into an overlay for the game. might be worth linking to for newer players in the wiki?
[2022-12-08 21:06:15] <kasabira_21> @Pohx Does "deal double damage" works with RF?
[2022-12-08 21:06:15] <warchiefbruiser> @Svetliaka92 saffels also has 30 spell block like the shield and is busted
[2022-12-08 21:06:17] <eraInferno> @warchiefbruiser you realize it's probably the reliable shield choice because you can't target farm or craft right
[2022-12-08 21:06:22] <TeiTV> fair enough
[2022-12-08 21:06:34] <warchiefbruiser> @eraInferno saffels is pretty similar
[2022-12-08 21:07:08] <warchiefbruiser> @lemoncoolers its harder than mapping so why not overdo defenses a little?
[2022-12-08 21:07:14] <%Divio> gotcha
[2022-12-08 21:07:14] <wrathmd> Hi, big fan of your work. Can you comment on using petrified blood for RF jugg?
[2022-12-08 21:07:16] <Hillgrove> do you have any progression tips for maps and onwards.  Do you focus on specific league mechanics to get gear or again.. just YOLO ? :D
[2022-12-08 21:07:26] <eraInferno> @warchiefbruiser Saffel's is a random drop, the other shield is given to you level 1. Not sure your point
[2022-12-08 21:07:30] VIEWERS: 2 018
[2022-12-08 21:07:47] <%lemoncoolers> because it's basically a completely different game mode. You can't really apply the logic of deep delve to the normal game they're two completely different things. It's not just "overdo" defense it's just different. @warchiefbruiser

[2022-12-08 21:07:55] <warchiefbruiser> @eraInferno i can skip the spell block until i can trade saffels in hc

[2022-12-08 21:09:13] <wrathmd> since we have a super high regen rate does petrified blood help avoid getting killed or is it better to have the higher life pool? not for going low life dmg. tks

[2022-12-08 21:17:54] <budspencer44> Hey Pohx yesterday you did those crafts on wands with "minion" essence for "Minions deal % increased Damage" so is it also good to have this mod on rings to?

[2022-12-08 21:18:35] <+shad0w_wa1ker> @Pohx how do you think RF will perform in the upcoming league mechanic where we have to take the least dmg/hits.
[2022-12-08 21:18:39] <+m0rdekaiser_> @lemoncoolers just saying, cause people feel bad to engage SSF with no confidence
[2022-12-08 21:18:45] <herot1c> How beginner friendly is RF? I have like 100 hours in poe and even with guides struggle to understand the game; when to really start gearing, crafting items etc.
[2022-12-08 21:18:46] <%lemoncoolers> @krogodaxl_joe Yes but only if you have two curses on impresence
[2022-12-08 21:18:48] <Hillgrove> is this the SSF stash? if so I seems juicing is very much possible in SSF
[2022-12-08 21:18:50] <+TheoBr0mine> fair enough yeah

[2022-12-08 21:22:55] <+shinywhimsicott> @Pohx please forgive the question asked probably countless times, would it be possible to use Volcanic Fissure with Righteous Fire as they both would scale with AoE and Fire damage?

[2022-12-08 21:23:07] <%lemoncoolers> @Hillgrove hard to describe. Watch some videos or streams
[2022-12-08 21:23:14] <Vileguy> the game used to be a lot slower and less going on
[2022-12-08 21:23:26] <+Gamoranin> not a spell at all
[2022-12-08 21:23:26] <wrathmd> are influenced gloves with trap mods worth pursuing for extra single target dmg? ty!

[2022-12-08 21:23:29] <+UndeadZX> volcanic fissure seems to be more of a melee attack

[2022-12-08 21:24:15] <%+Chauthe> I see on your FAQ website section it says RF isnt' scaled by "spell damage" , is it affected at all?
[2022-12-08 21:24:34] <+TheoBr0mine> are there any cool alternate quality skill gems this build can/should utilize?
[2022-12-08 21:24:45] <%lemoncoolers> @Chauthe read the RF gem

[2022-12-08 21:25:25] <+m0rdekaiser_> @cazlly so thats okay keep playing with good guides for some leagues until u feel confortable to diverge more and more
[2022-12-08 21:25:26] <%uToaster> @Noctvurnal that's a you call, I personally like something with decent dmg and tankiness for a league start.. after I get that I farm to build higher dmg builds (normally DO Osscultist)
[2022-12-08 21:25:30] <+Bolut> did u buy all  effect for RF? what is r favorite or recommend?
[2022-12-08 21:25:32] <%+AnfieldRed7> it is pretty counterintuitive that it doesnt.  But alas.

[2022-12-08 21:26:20] <%+Chauthe> appreciate explanation though!
[2022-12-08 21:26:34] <+Kanit00> You can get a 21 vaal rf chauthe, just not immediately
[2022-12-08 21:26:35] <%+Noctvurnal> @utoaster I do rather go for fully survival, can It still does a decent damage focusing harder in survive?
[2022-12-08 21:26:36] <%lemoncoolers> @Chauthe read the righteous fire gem. It applies a multiplier to other spells. Fire trap is a spell.

[2022-12-08 21:31:59] <+TheoBr0mine> is it worth to push ES on the Jugg, or just focus on life? the RF skill says it burns ES too but im unsure how well it trades off with mod slots/life nodes
[2022-12-08 21:32:02] <+AtNola> @Pohx With your RF leveling loot filter is there a way to know what items colors and sounds represent for lot that drops?

[2022-12-08 21:34:25] <Fiendmaw> My only gripe with RF this league is that we'll eat a ton of those resolve inducing moves because of how the AoE is centered around you.
[2022-12-08 21:34:27] <sirman_james> go on tft and just sell the tabs? maybe (please dont yell at me)

[2022-12-08 21:34:50] <z1xt3r> in your leveling trees you take the top endurance charge and the leading one has str, but the bottom one has 0.2% life regen per endurance charge, better to take that one instesd ?

[2022-12-08 21:34:57] <Fiendmaw> Yeah.thinking of doing that
[2022-12-08 21:34:57] <Some_Awe> resolve also deals less damage when youre closer to the source
[2022-12-08 21:35:19] <%+dauthitrix> (Gauntlet) - Why is Divine Shield not worth the 1 point dip?
[2022-12-08 21:35:23] <SilverkissTwitch> Also they've said that resolve hits scales inversely to distance so if you're close to mobs you'll take less resolve damage

[2022-12-08 21:35:48] <%+Chauthe> yeah ppl in chat are making me apprehensive to respond, I read the Gem, I read the Vaal Gem, I was still confused so I went to your FAQ "How do you scale RF" says in big RED TEXT that it doesn't scale from spell damage.. so I was confused, figured I'd ask for clarification. I think I understand now thanks!

[2022-12-08 21:36:19] <z1xt3r> the earlier trees take the top endurance charge not the bottom till 80
[2022-12-08 21:36:36] <+Kage_Creed> Divine shield if you dont have Aegis or a shaper ES recovery shield its not worth anything.

[2022-12-08 21:51:03] <+Xmitty> It sounds like you would love the active noise cancelling in some modern earbuds (like the new airpod pros). Complete silence, even in louder areas. It produces soundwaves that cancel ambient noise so you get absolute silence. Quieter than earbuds in a closet. It's insane and a little disorienting at first.

[2022-12-08 22:01:43] <YeAhx69> @Hillgrove Rather farm lower maps if its that bad but you are probably doing something wrong if you can't basic mobs in 1 passing. so take a look at your gear

[2022-12-08 22:22:39] <+mammaries1> @Fiendmaw i definitely feel like they are saving QOL features for after bad leagues
[2022-12-08 22:22:52] <BrutalKGB> I wish GGG would at least set something up to automatically dump affinitied remove only tabs into your normal standard tabs
[2022-12-08 22:23:03] <+ReinVorlind> Yeah. If your build isn't playable by level 90, the last 10 should be whatever
[2022-12-08 22:23:17] <Fiendmaw> Mammaries that might be the case,but I still feel like they are super crunched for time with their schedule
[2022-12-08 22:23:45] <+ReinVorlind> Yeah. You have to force chaos res on every slot

[2022-12-08 22:35:13] <denial55> gem tab or flask is nice

[2022-12-08 22:35:25] <TheCosmicAstro> was thinking about getting a gem tab cause i save gems out the ass and they take up so much space

[2022-12-08 22:35:33] <%Haxel96> but then again i should probably stop using it as a dump tab, because i just quit playing when it eventually fills up KEKW
[2022-12-08 22:35:35] <%+Pope_SWE> IamDreameR_ no
[2022-12-08 22:35:41] <TheCosmicAstro> poe is pay for convenience
[2022-12-08 22:35:45] <snipernee1> @iamdreamer_ no but pay to have a better quality of life yes
[2022-12-08 22:35:48] <%+5y5t3m5> there is 0 pay to win in poe
[2022-12-08 22:35:50] <+ReinVorlind> Pay for QOL
[2022-12-08 22:35:51] <%lemoncoolers> stash tabs save you time. That means it's pay to win.
[2022-12-08 22:35:51] <beyondplan> Ziz says its pay to win
[2022-12-08 22:35:52] <YeAhx69> @lemoncoolers 100% this. throw a quad tab or two

[2022-12-08 22:36:01] <HamzaNaz> Hello beautiful sir.
[2022-12-08 22:36:01] <%+Pope_SWE> tbh i think poe is the perfect mix on ingame money system
[2022-12-08 22:36:11] <+teufeltal> I'm leveling Jugg, got to level 52 and 600 life regen. I think I won't die anymore :D
[2022-12-08 22:36:13] <poe_spinner> quad tabs lost a big portion of there usage since the affinitys were introduced (and i like it)
[2022-12-08 22:36:18] <+TheoBr0mine> but maps is so fun
[2022-12-08 22:36:18] <+jisuo> Ziz says he has a VERY strict version of "pay to win"
[2022-12-08 22:36:20] <denial55> how many max stacks of whetstones do u have good sir?
[2022-12-08 22:36:21] <%lemoncoolers> PoE is the least p2w free game on the market but premium tabs are literally p2w
[2022-12-08 22:36:25] <il_Bananin> for me it's pay to play (in trade)
[2022-12-08 22:36:26] <Fiendmaw> If you are at a point where you need tabs,it means you played for dozens of hours.
[2022-12-08 22:36:29] <%Haxel96> IMO PoE is kind of pay to play, not pay to win, i cant imagine playing without some of the stash tabs
[2022-12-08 22:36:32] <%+mrp1nk_live> I like Pestily's take. PoE is free to try but you pay for convenience.
[2022-12-08 22:36:38] <GlaceShadow> Ziz said it's basically pay to play, not pay to win
[2022-12-08 22:36:41] <LasMike> for me it's more of a buy 2 play after extended trial, you don't have to keep spending money on poe like on other games, you buy tabs once and that's it
[2022-12-08 22:36:46] <Calynz> it is pay for convenience
[2022-12-08 22:36:48] <%Haxel96> @LasMike this
[2022-12-08 22:37:06] <%lemoncoolers> pay to play is a better way to describe PoE
[2022-12-08 22:37:12] <%+5y5t3m5> you can only access the market if you have a premium tab. but not being able to sell is not that bad

[2022-12-08 22:38:11] <poe_spinner> i consider poe not pay to win. you dont get more by dumping more money. if you set the bar very low it is pay to play and free to try (unlimited). for 60$ you get much more out of it compared to any other game
[2022-12-08 22:38:13] <+ReinVorlind> I've give them about $100 for like 5k hours. Absolute steal.

[2022-12-08 23:25:41] <dalwand> Actually, do you want the Brass dome for the big armor thing or for the -5 to max resists?
[2022-12-08 23:25:46] <!%Rickjamesyies> personally I think for fire leveling using rolling magma is just too good to not use
[2022-12-08 23:25:53] <AussieReject> what time does new League start?
[2022-12-08 23:25:58] <dalwand> I.e. when is a rare better than a brass dome?

[2022-12-08 23:27:00] <dalwand> Yeah but for a rich fuk in standard like me ;-) I have 6links with 2500 armor, is that potentially better than a Brass dome?

[2022-12-08 23:28:25] <+Badd_Boi> @asarkiro are you fire res capped?
[2022-12-08 23:28:40] <+Maximummayhem123> should have lik 78 fire res
[2022-12-08 23:28:48] <TheCosmicAstro> how long did it take you to start retaining important information like how to craft everything you need and where everything is on the tree relevant to your build
[2022-12-08 23:28:48] <+Asarkiro> Fire res is 87 so yes capped at 75
[2022-12-08 23:29:04] <+LightcallerTV> cap should be 79 by 35
[2022-12-08 23:29:06] <+Maximummayhem123> should have some max res at that point
[2022-12-08 23:29:12] <krogodaxl_joe> is purity of fire better for leveling than elements? bc of max res?

[2022-12-08 23:30:31] <TheCosmicAstro> @Asarkiro make sure you have the 79% fire res on top of vitality and stone golem cant be level 1, they have to be the appropriate level to sustain
[2022-12-08 23:30:34] <%+deano901> that like 3% of the regen

[2022-12-08 23:31:40] <+Gamoranin> yeah if you have 75 cause that's what it adds up to
[2022-12-08 23:31:44] <%+deano901> possibly
[2022-12-08 23:31:44] <+Isshan> ah

[2022-12-08 23:35:41] <+LightcallerTV> To be clear I understand the max res points. But for new players perhaps make that tree section 30-35 and then add the next 5 points into the next tree up.

[2022-12-08 23:36:16] <+Maximummayhem123> +1% max res is more than just -1% fire damage taken
[2022-12-08 23:36:18] <SuprMeatDude> @TheCosmicAstro ??????
[2022-12-08 23:36:24] <seruarg> @darkkwiskas use holy flame
[2022-12-08 23:36:30] <+TraNNNca> @TheCosmicAstro well, you still get improved regen, however, it looks like you dont get that much as you used to, but I suppose you could still be able to have about 800-900 regen if you get good items
[2022-12-08 23:36:32] <%inig0h> @SuprMeatDude follow the pob please really you need 79
[2022-12-08 23:36:34] <niceplayer69> @Pohx is by any chance a version of RF where you convert to cold or something else
[2022-12-08 23:36:53] <GoGoLoThirty> Bro I remember the very first time I tried to copy Kripps build at the start of beta, PoB didnt exist yet, I got to maps with a spell damage scaling Power Siphon build KEKW
[2022-12-08 23:36:54] <+LightcallerTV> For sure, there is value in learning as a new player too
[2022-12-08 23:36:55] <denial55> do we lose all the red beasts going back to standard?
[2022-12-08 23:36:57] <SuprMeatDude> @inig0h ok thanks very helpful chatters :)
[2022-12-08 23:37:01] <DarkKwiskas> @seruarg good idea :)
[2022-12-08 23:37:07] <BorinBardungson> I was lvl 35 when i changed and i used 3 flask till i rememberd to took out my golem. then it was fine
[2022-12-08 23:37:08] <iNNet> Your guide is already VERY beginner friendly and going into detail more than a lot of other guides! @Pohx
[2022-12-08 23:37:13] <+Metatron77> The guide and supplemental materials, including the FAQ/wiki, are basically the most robust that exist for any build. Making it more granular or explanatory is just wasted work imo
[2022-12-08 23:37:22] <%+deano901> @niceplayer69 he did a cold covert a while back think there might be videos on his youtube.
[2022-12-08 23:37:29] <TheCosmicAstro> @TraNNNca what im saying is the regen between sanctuary and pious path is now exactly the same. So theoretically you should be able to use righteous fire earlier
[2022-12-08 23:37:31] <%+HeartZey> @SuprMeatDude if u have 69 fire res, you are far from doing uber
[2022-12-08 23:37:38] <+Maximummayhem123> if they arent using vitality and stone golem they will degen
[2022-12-08 23:37:47] <%inig0h> Vitality golem and node
[2022-12-08 23:37:49] <seruarg> as a rf jugg what do i respec to later for ubers?

[2022-12-08 23:38:15] <+LightcallerTV> Wasn't trying to call you lazy. I know it would be a big change certainly this late. Just figured since 35 is that transition point

[2022-12-08 23:38:20] <DarkKwiskas> @mab0913 that's what @seruarg  adviced indeed. It's a good idea
[2022-12-08 23:38:21] <+1080pleb> @mab0913 what supports for that? added fire, and...?

[2022-12-08 23:38:46] <TheCosmicAstro> watching your guide videos over and over also helps. Rewatching you pick up things you missed the first go around
[2022-12-08 23:38:49] <ritch850> I followed your RF Inq build for the first time 4 seasons ago, fell in love with it and have played it every league since then, and I'll play it again this upcoming league. It's perfect!
[2022-12-08 23:38:49] <+ReinVorlind> It's never-ending
[2022-12-08 23:38:52] <+LightcallerTV> No no all good. I really really apprecaite your guides and honestly all the stuff i learn just watching stream
[2022-12-08 23:38:53] <+1080pleb> @lemoncoolers ok coo, thanks
[2022-12-08 23:38:58] <+Metatron77> @LightcallerTV one consideration that Pohx mentioned in his campaign playthrough video (published yesterday) is that a newer player may want to wait until 40 to transition instead of pushing right at 35
[2022-12-08 23:38:59] <%+itsVandole> @Pohx the work is NEVER done, you eventually just have to ship it and move on. you killin it and the grind is real

[2022-12-08 23:56:41] <+GIMMETHEL00T> Got it, so all the minion bonuses all apply to you cause of that one node. Pretty cool
[2022-12-08 23:56:46] <+Mr__Struggle> what will you league start ? jugg or inquiz ?
