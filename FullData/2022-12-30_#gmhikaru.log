[2022-12-30 09:07:16] <ieatnsleep> why didny rapport go for it and play the draw line with hikaru

[2022-12-30 09:07:20] <sasastar69> @leftoverlime draw
[2022-12-30 09:07:25] <IMadeh1> rapport knows that hikaru is strong in blitz he does not want to take chances

[2022-12-30 09:07:45] <leftoverlime> @sasastar69 thank you sweetie
[2022-12-30 09:07:46] <ieatnsleep> it was rapport game to win. Hikaru obviously is happy with a draw with black

[2022-12-30 09:07:59] <@%+Creamsicle> @kandyrenee he's up a full point on the field and rapport is one of the strongest players in the field, a draw with black is a good result
[2022-12-30 09:08:00] <%$hiiipwr8> hikaru shouldn't draw, magnus will catch up
[2022-12-30 09:08:01] <tompanathas> did hikaru draw the first round?

[2022-12-30 09:08:12] <!%qtjelly> Anyone wondering, Hikaru is just barely the slight favorite to win going in to today, as expected at 52%, Magnus at 35% , anyone else 13%

[2022-12-30 09:08:47] <%+John_Lloyd_Cruz> You would think he needs at least 7 points to win. Drawing every game for 4.5 pts isn‚Äôt going to get it done, especially with 5 strong players only 1 pt behind

[2022-12-30 09:11:17] <katakuri4life> Jeffery or fiona this is a question I always try to ask but never got an answer, is starting chess again at 20 still fine if I want a title to my name?

[2022-12-30 09:14:58] <%+John_Lloyd_Cruz> @daydreamer38 nah, the problem is if he starts drawing too many games, you would think one of those 5 players behind will get hot and leapfrog him

[2022-12-30 09:18:25] <%+John_Lloyd_Cruz> @daydreamer38 just that it‚Äôs going to be a shootout. Drawing every game will only get him 4.5 pts today. Don‚Äôt think that will be enough, especially since Magnus is now only 0.5 pts behind and they‚Äôve already played so he can‚Äôt stop a Magnus win streak. He‚Äôs probably going to need at least 6.5 pts or 7 pts today to win

[2022-12-30 10:34:46] <@%jaroniscaring> ", Artemiev after a game insisted to have the result a draw he said Hikaru didn't deserve to lose t and Hikaru refused saying "no you won" the stupid arbiter covered it by his back both were REALLY gentlemen about it "

[2022-12-30 10:39:20] <+Kevz95> @wanderingbishop he should be leading though. They marked his round 14 as a loss instead of a win. He beat dubov. So he should have 11.5 and dubov 9.5

[2022-12-30 10:42:45] <!%qtjelly> Grischuk is 1.5 behind
[2022-12-30 10:42:47] <%sujythebrave> Chat...Hikaru played the whole top10 already.
[2022-12-30 10:42:49] <calculus2002> daaamn hes playing horribly today

[2022-12-30 10:43:04] <kegztand> Maybe chess does not speak for itself
[2022-12-30 10:43:08] <!%fionchetta> any idea why hikaru didn't play duda @lozcooper ?
[2022-12-30 10:43:08] <%+Draconide> Because Hikaru had too many poimts

[2022-12-30 10:43:17] <%thewizardmelon> I‚Äôm hoping now Hikaru has played the top 10, we get some easier opponents

[2022-12-30 10:43:50] <Thequeen_ofaus> is the elo bar accurate whatso ever in blitz
[2022-12-30 10:43:53] <parsashahrokni> constantly missing the best move

[2022-12-30 10:44:36] <@%Xrispie> @free_to_try small board is live, the bigger one is for analysis
[2022-12-30 10:44:37] <%+Draconide> 21 rounds so that has to happen
[2022-12-30 10:44:41] <turboopit> hikaru w

[2022-12-30 11:46:45] <CubicaSoundStudio> @aceofspade07 Hikaru was born in Japan to a Japanese father and an North-american mother. They divorced and Hikaru emigrated to live with the mother in the East Coast (Florida and near New York). You can choose to represent a country which accepts you to under FIDE rules. Sometimes, countries accept foreign players if they pay a fee, or sometimes they reject an offer because they want to allow a local player to play and not occupy the representation position

He'll usually start streaming between 8am and 11am Eastern. We will try to pin a schedule to his twitter every week.

[2022-12-30 12:24:52] <shucklesors> @gaiusbaltar_ you cant always be first, and you have to lick your wounds and try to be second in those cases. like the fact that this needs to be explained... do you just watch american protagonist movies all day? wow
[2022-12-30 12:24:56] <ryogai> Magnus had a big chance to save the Sarana game midway, but blew it and made a big blunder a bit later

[2022-12-30 12:39:10] <vega92zzzzz> Don't tell me hikaru already lose in blitz.. no way
[2022-12-30 12:39:10] <popocaffepetl> My prediction: Hikaru wins, Magnus draws and then intense final round, but draw. And Hikaru wins the armagedon after 4+ games
[2022-12-30 12:39:15] <+aveciszka> -_-
[2022-12-30 12:39:16] <%anurag10x> next round in 45 seconds

[2022-12-30 12:39:25] <%klutch_easilyy> @19195 we just need Magnus to draw one of the two games and Hikaru to win both. And hopefully Duda or Sarana won‚Äôt be tied for first as well
[2022-12-30 12:39:25] <xlreliquishlx> Keynes vs hikaru next
