[2022-12-27 15:41:29] <%ven_skywalker> Hello there! Just making the rounds to everyone. How was everyone‚Äôs holiday?
[2022-12-27 15:41:33] <%jerzh93> I started with bloodborne mikkaaCosy
[2022-12-27 15:41:34] <lagastrolo> @Kieran96cfc i normally play on the switch and i saw Darksouls remastered  So hence my question, but if elden ring is easier than i guess that would be better for me?
[2022-12-27 15:41:39] <%+s_ebecrep> elden ring first, but then you're going to miss jumps on souls
[2022-12-27 15:41:43] <Wayneinanity> play gta v
[2022-12-27 15:41:50] <%brianthebroken85> I feel like if you start with Elden Ring, you'd have no reason to go back to the earlier games? I would recommend Dark Souls 3, then if you like it, DS 1 and 2, then if you want more Sekiro, then on to the ultimate game, Elden Ring.

[2022-12-27 15:42:11] <%Bradxkillyou> @lagastrolo If you have any interest in playing the Dark Souls games, play them in order. Playing ER or DS3 and then going back to DS1 feels like crap
[2022-12-27 15:42:14] <%Jeagarn_84> Mikka forgot to charge the controller hehe?

[2022-12-27 15:42:55] <lagastrolo> @lagastrolo This is what I was thinking as well. Cuz elden ring is very smooth and the graphci looks nice!  But DS 1  on switch might be crappy then idd

[2022-12-27 15:43:52] <%brianthebroken85> @enricoboss21 Dark Souls 3 is the most polished. If you play it and love it, then you could take a trip back to the earlier games after.

[2022-12-27 15:44:56] <%Bradxkillyou> Regardless of platform, DS1 is a slower, clunkier game than the sequels. I think if you play 3 first, there's not as much reason to go back for 1 + 2
[2022-12-27 15:44:56] <%brianthebroken85> @Thugmansionz Yeah, there's also that angle. True.

[2022-12-27 16:15:59] <BladeMathews> @NitramYaj I think it's less "split focus" and more like nothing gets our 100% focus unless we're hyperfocused and that's not a choice. We tend to be more aware of the things around us than "normal" people and I think that makes it easier to whip back and forth between both screens. If that makes sense
[2022-12-27 16:15:59] <@%xblom> @Radolov ok thanks

[2022-12-27 16:55:12] <%krenzler> Depends on whether you want open or closed type headphones. And how much clamping force you can tolerate. Beyerdynamic DT-770 are pretty good also for low price. Comes in 32, 80 and 250 ohm versions.

[2022-12-27 17:31:25] <%Longknife> The problem with rushing is Mohg's AI correctly assesses what you're doing and either throws bood down or does blood claw, which you're guaranteed to eat. It becomes a question of if you can keep regularly healing both characters because both will regularly need it
[2022-12-27 17:31:29] <taken_for_granted> fasHYPERS so far so good

[2022-12-27 17:33:41] <sl0wburn420> what do you swing with on the dance mat
[2022-12-27 17:33:46] <taken_for_granted> aliyEAT probably , im only thinking about the elden lord which the whole game is named after
[2022-12-27 17:33:54] <%leetnanas> Play randomizer on PC and normal on PS5
[2022-12-27 17:33:57] <+wSkezzo> to be fair streaming it also makes it 3 things at same time is insane

[2022-12-27 18:19:55] <lifelinememes> the problem is without flask he heals too much its annoying
[2022-12-27 18:19:58] <DoctorCyrax> I forgot, this boss deals some insane damage, I can hardly manage with a controller LUL

[2022-12-27 19:52:24] <%pink_noizz> better to use the tear when hes about to do that blood attack

[2022-12-27 19:52:42] <JRScribe> poor equipment optimization and use is a major reason that a lot of people see this game as so hard
[2022-12-27 19:52:47] <+shekondar1> use it before the phase transistion
[2022-12-27 19:52:54] <%pink_noizz> when he starts counting down
[2022-12-27 19:52:55] <gangtokay> It works for 1 whole Nihil.
[2022-12-27 19:52:59] <+shekondar1> so after 2 rings are around you is when I do it
[2022-12-27 19:53:22] <gangtokay> You can use it right away.
[2022-12-27 19:53:28] <JRScribe> and some people have a gaming style that are best at so some equipment is more suited for them

[2022-12-27 19:53:40] <%brianthebroken85> yeah., before 2nd phase transition. Completely nullifies his whole blood curse - though he still regains life.

[2022-12-27 20:15:22] <+BattyGoose> Could you just constantly dodge roll on controller while killing on dance mat then kill on controller when mat is killed?

[2022-12-27 20:16:32] <JRScribe> that's basically the number one rule of any game... you always have to have slightly more aggression than defense
