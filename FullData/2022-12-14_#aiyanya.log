(And a beautiful one at that) I try my best to respect women. Especially women in gaming. As a matter of fact now i actually do agree with you. I'm sorry maybe you could even add me on PC and we can play some games together. We could play GTA, Overwatch, Minecraft, maybe even a little cod. Add me D$ddy_Sex69.

[2022-12-14 14:43:17] <%Phlink__> @dark_fable thats why I learn to fix as many things I can myself. The same happens in automotive repair. I figure if anyone will fix my stuff right, it will be me. zanyraWiggy
[2022-12-14 14:43:26] <+Kaldannan> @warrenayiss Happens sometimes, unless you specifically toggle off the ability to receive subs to channels you don't follow
