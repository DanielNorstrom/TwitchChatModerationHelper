[2022-12-29 05:56:57] <@%kdlutz> it was pretty wholesome tbh tho, but i did feel bad
[2022-12-29 05:56:58] <%mdkubit> The one time I got that drunk, I'd done something crazy like 10 shots of 151 Rum... while sitting on the floor. I didn't realize how badly I was under, until I stood up to go back to my bedroom. Room went sideways, floor became wall, etc.
[2022-12-29 05:57:05] <%director_jake> OH

[2022-12-29 08:07:13] <noahneptune07> I help alot of depress people on discord because i think everyone need someone to listen yo them
[2022-12-29 08:07:15] <@%kdlutz> music is a big one for me, but you have to find what works for you. Meditation also helped me a lot
[2022-12-29 08:07:29] <%hahaimadecoy> i have to bottle everything up bc i'm the emotionless one, the one you take your problem to, the one that will always help, the one that just doesn't care. little do they know i care more than most people could even image

[2022-12-29 08:08:57] <iszabael> @hahaimadecoy i've been the same for a loooong time, try and talk to a therapist or a counclor, it can help

[2022-12-29 08:09:05] <@%kdlutz> true art whether its a drawing or music or whatever, is for oneself and so i think it never matters what anyone else thinks
[2022-12-29 08:09:17] <%fps_wolf22> I just bottle a lot of stress and depression, probably reasons i'm not good at socializing, but i'll look at other approaches as you said
[2022-12-29 08:09:20] <noahneptune07> I just keep them inside i want them to go out but it’s hurt to do it
