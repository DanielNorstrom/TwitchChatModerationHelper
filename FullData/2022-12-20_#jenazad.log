[2022-12-20 09:03:19] <^Nightbot> Yulha is currently popular because 1: She has a 100% provoke on her S1 (krau does not) 2: her S2 lets her full cleanse + gives herself a barrier AND cr push, which essentially guarantees she gets her S3 off at low hp (krau is worthless vs debuffs) 3: her S3 ignores all damage share (including arrowell's escort) + heals her if it kills. She is a solid answer to currently popular units like Lhc, adin, riolet, etc due to how easy it is for her to kill them with her S3

[2022-12-20 09:05:26] <%thedefault888> I think the problem with e7 YouTube is that it doesn’t age well since something that’s released a couple months ago would be completely outdated. A lot of people advise never watching YouTube for e7 pvp stuff

[2022-12-20 10:49:57] <@%ProfessorBloak> @jopze For the multiple units, take it one at a time. Use hero priority to set your heroes ranked on who you want to have the best gear (lower ranked heroes wont take gear from higher ranked heroes, and higher ranked heroes can take gear from everyone below them). Play around with it to get your units how you like
