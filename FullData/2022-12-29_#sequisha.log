[2022-12-29 04:30:35] <TheKuroKuma> I thought DLSS and FRS is for those going from 720p->1080p and 1080p->1440p,

[2022-12-29 04:50:27] <%+bitter_barista> just had a 12 minute wait to scav into factory, but that mf had 40k rubles in his pocket so I guess it was worth it
[2022-12-29 04:50:32] <%iGotMoxy> As other have said @Sequisha I would probably use Nvidia DLSS instead of FSR because that actually uses the hardware in nvidia cards from my understanding
[2022-12-29 04:50:34] <+AcousticDivine> they should at least give people a tetris mini-game to play while they wait 20-30 mins

[2022-12-29 04:51:22] <+BrownBear2105> @Shaggy_Dan same here
[2022-12-29 04:51:27] <%+OlBoyGoose> reflex works by keeping the GPU render queue in check so it doesn't get overloaded, when it gets backed up is when Latency is introduced. Reflex doesn't necessarily increase FPS, just keeps GPU usage from going higher than about 95%
[2022-12-29 04:51:27] <TompawP> @Sequisha for all the times u made me chuckle, made me feel nothing else matters , and u get us immersed i wanna actually really love u for it, u do alot of good in this world in thsse and any times with ur endless humor and personality. i really love u for it <3<3<3<3<3<3 obe of the very best

[2022-12-29 05:10:10] <%JohnDoeRadio> it was a pretty detailed verdict
[2022-12-29 05:10:12] <%senttiee> They were creating mechanisms that misled children leading to them spending their parents money
[2022-12-29 05:10:16] <+RepoManOG> they made it really easy and not appearent that you're spending moms money
[2022-12-29 05:10:16] <adjacentpixels> I did see that as well, actually
[2022-12-29 05:10:17] <+kinghunter150> epic is just chinese spyware
[2022-12-29 05:10:18] <%Saren42> yeah, they got dinged hard by the FTC in the US, for previous preditory practices, they admited guilt, and were like "We fucked up, we're trying to do better"

[2022-12-29 05:10:49] <brujeria____> one of the reasons is they wouldnt refund people for skins bought bcs of misclicks when the game showed a loading screen
[2022-12-29 05:10:50] <%JohnDoeRadio> id say it was a pioneer tax

[2022-12-29 05:18:13] <CrankyGerman> These "dark patterns" include tricking players into making unintended in-game purchases through a "counterintuitive, inconsistent, and confusing button configuration," including being charged while waking up from sleep mode. The FTC also says that account holders can be charged without authorization, and that children have racked up "hundreds of dollars" in charges before parents were aware of what was happening.

[2022-12-29 08:53:14] <%ArdeeCA> DLSS just reduces the internal render resolution and uses AI to upscale the image, DSR is just feeding it a bigger target image so the internal resolution scales

[2022-12-29 08:56:13] <Subwayjack919> @boboception Its closer but also not, because it's running everything on your system. The BEST way to test it perfectly is to go into a real raid.

[2022-12-29 09:31:07] <jopsie> for hunt bin audio is great
[2022-12-29 09:31:11] <Subwayjack919> Under the Manage 3D settings->Programs, Tarkov is selected when you changed the DSR, right?
[2022-12-29 09:31:13] <s0akitincider> binaural audio = HRTF
[2022-12-29 09:31:16] <ShadowsparksTV> @achilles86 Congratulations

[2022-12-29 09:31:24] <%+OlBoyGoose> hunt showdown was full blown steam audio, they had all modules active and tuned....tarkov only had one module turned on which is binarual
[2022-12-29 09:31:26] <brogsy_> cute congratulations chatter
[2022-12-29 09:31:30] <+Hellyunn> so we are taking binaural off?

[2022-12-29 09:31:45] <Akkrecola> Binaural is generally the way to go, but they apparently broke it for now. It's causing major stutters.

[2022-12-29 09:33:10] <xTmSpAz> Window fullscreen and It might show the "custom resolutions" This is purely guess work because that's how it worked in Albion with custom resolutions @Sequisha
[2022-12-29 09:33:10] <%ArdeeCA> I have a feeling this is going to be a nightmare in OBS to use DSR
[2022-12-29 09:33:19] <JaynisK> Back in March, Veritas made that 3 hour video in favor of Binaural. Now BSG fucks it up with the long awaited Streets patch. pepeLaugh
[2022-12-29 09:33:20] <theepaulraul> He doesn't change them on his game. I believe it takes those resolutions and then downscales them to your resolution automatically. but that is just my guess
[2022-12-29 09:33:24] <brogsy_> 29th is drops for everyone, then the next few days have shifts of streamers

[2022-12-29 09:34:06] <s0akitincider> you never want to use legacy DSR, on deep learning DRS (DLDSR)
[2022-12-29 09:34:09] <ChukKota> Look at resolution maybe?
[2022-12-29 09:34:15] <%+OlBoyGoose> DSR only applies under global yeah
[2022-12-29 09:34:18] <%ArdeeCA> The option doesn't do anything unless you set the game resolution to that DSR res you enabled

[2022-12-29 09:34:46] <%ArdeeCA> Think of it like a 'fake' high resolution that your monitor doesn't support

[2022-12-29 11:22:26] <JaynisK> Revolver Shotgun is the same way, Single Action vs Double Action. SA gives more of a delay between shots, but DA removes that but you get an accuracy penalty. I dunno how big the penalty is though.

[2022-12-29 15:48:03] <%SneakySmoker38> they did add the side arm speed buff if you get a weapon jam last wipe
[2022-12-29 15:48:04] <SwampmanTheNPC> that would make so much sense, because right now having pistol is pretty useless most of time :D
[2022-12-29 15:48:09] <+edgar_frog> what? throwing your weapon on the ground is not realistic.
[2022-12-29 15:48:09] <%+gironimo01> and a sling would get in the way for a fast draw on the sidearm
[2022-12-29 15:48:14] <MisterFriki> Streamer loot.
[2022-12-29 15:48:14] <RandoTheHero> I agree, sidearm should come out and ready quickly, that's the point of a sidearm

[2022-12-29 16:13:28] <+Elitejohny> @x_kraeven_x i would recommend using the wiki maps or one of the interactive map websites that show where all the extracts are. Then when you first spawn double tap O to see your current extracts and make sure which one you need to go to on the wiki

[2022-12-29 16:14:11] <%+Smoke_Cohhilition> @x_kraeven_x yeah i did the same thing, some maps the extracts are easy to figure out; some are quite rough to learn from PMC especially
[2022-12-29 16:14:11] <old_zaweri> thats why grizzly is the fastest medkit in the game, it heals so fast once it starts healing

[2022-12-29 16:21:30] <x_kraeven_x> the fact i cant play this game without a map on a second monitor and youtube videos just ruins my experience big time

[2022-12-29 16:54:51] <%iamCodec> Dark and Darker basically has base version of Tarkov stash size
[2022-12-29 16:54:52] <BodyBones> bunch of junk you never use
[2022-12-29 16:54:53] <%+Deterginator107> more weapon variety required before larger invenvtories
[2022-12-29 16:54:57] <SaltyAsChuck> @Sequisha I think the small stash makes trades more powerful.. only pick up the best and get it sold

[2022-12-29 16:55:02] <+1purplemoose> keep it small, force people to use their gear and potentially lose it
[2022-12-29 16:55:04] <+Fostiir> what if its like location based inventory like early new world
[2022-12-29 16:55:04] <%adjacentpixels> it's definitely a bit more gritty with less storage

[2022-12-29 16:55:10] <%Rida_plz> I like Dark and Darker's stash size. It feels like you're living out of  secure trunk at an inn
[2022-12-29 16:55:11] <MrFoufi> yeah but people love colecting stuff and never go out with it
[2022-12-29 16:55:12] <+zipcodelive> yeah it should feel punishing to die.
[2022-12-29 16:55:15] <%+sandycrax> they should increase the coin bag capacity
[2022-12-29 16:55:16] <%MrNussi> agreed
[2022-12-29 16:55:16] <%+Smoke_Cohhilition> Smaller stash means less hoarding and people using the good gear more often instead of constant gear fear

[2022-12-29 16:55:20] <Kuhnivess> @Deterginator107 no it doesn't. You don't need 1 of every weapon in your stash
[2022-12-29 16:55:23] <%Sean_eth> The inventory was a hurdle for you to over come, that was the point of it, the fact people didn't like it proves they weren't competent with the fucking game.

[2022-12-29 16:55:43] <%Danrul> I would keep the stash on one page, but add ways to further compress the money
[2022-12-29 16:55:43] <nightshift_2> maybe keep stash size the same and double the money bags to 100 cap
[2022-12-29 16:55:46] <SlightlyMorbid> Gamers want everything in their bag. all the guns. But it's supposed to make you feel vulnerable. It's the whole point of the survival horror genre
[2022-12-29 16:55:48] <+abbyssmaul> Ive always thought the magic of Tarkov is lost once everyone is rich which is why i dislike the market in Tarkov

[2022-12-29 16:56:25] <LtAceTFR> would be interesting to see tarkov have a "hardcore" mode with hardly any storage space

[2022-12-29 16:56:53] <%Khaladen> @sequisha I think adding like 2x2 or 3x3 'coffers' to stow gold bags in would solve the stash issues for D&D
