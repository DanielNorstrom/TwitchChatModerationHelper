[2022-12-08 21:37:40] <Captain__Reflex> what do you think of dwarf fortress so far ? should I invest in it ?
[2022-12-08 21:37:44] <latedoomer> corrective eq*
[2022-12-08 21:37:57] <latedoomer> your db output on the game is a tad high compared to your mic
[2022-12-08 21:38:00] <%+FatherOwens> @Captain__Reflex no for everyone
[2022-12-08 21:38:06] <latedoomer> your voice is very faint actually
[2022-12-08 21:38:28] <Captain__Reflex> @FatherOwens no for everyone ? as in its bad ?
[2022-12-08 21:38:41] <%+FatherOwens> no not all
[2022-12-08 21:38:45] <%+FatherOwens> not at all*
[2022-12-08 21:38:49] <itsDravidian> Klean you already play Rimworld? Its really simplified DF, would be a good intro into this game
[2022-12-08 21:38:53] <%+WaldemarMjoeen> How is the game treating you?

[2022-12-08 21:40:08] <%+WaldemarMjoeen> Seems really interesting, but kind of information overload.
[2022-12-08 21:40:10] <7Nights> have you ever played this before?
[2022-12-08 21:40:31] <%itshavoc420> Music low key slaps
[2022-12-08 21:40:39] <junkfarmer> much attention to detail
[2022-12-08 21:40:46] <de_charny> @FatherOwens It's not bad it's just dense and complex. If you like that sort of thing there are hours upon hours of content. if you're not willing to put in the time to learn you could get frustrated very fast
[2022-12-08 21:40:55] <KlngofGods> It says whether you are in a forest or not
[2022-12-08 21:40:55] <%BSDilly> Most people reccomend multiple hour long tutorial/guide videos before playing the game; thats what type of game it is lol
[2022-12-08 21:40:59] <junkfarmer> if you put down a statue then smooth the floors, you have to move statue out of the way
[2022-12-08 21:41:07] <de_charny> @itshavoc420 the vibe is great for the game
[2022-12-08 21:41:10] <RL07_> Can we see your vod from yesterday ?
[2022-12-08 21:41:14] <+macen> Did they optimize the memory usage? is FPS death better?
[2022-12-08 21:41:14] <junkfarmer> to smooth the spot under said statue
[2022-12-08 21:41:16] <ChiefStrongJaw> is this similar to rimworld?
[2022-12-08 21:41:30] <+macen> @ChiefStrongJaw It is the origin of the rimworld style of game.
[2022-12-08 21:41:31] <itsDravidian> Once things click, you will lose 1000's of hours like myself
[2022-12-08 21:41:31] <%+WaldemarMjoeen> Yeah that was what made me abit usecure if I was going to try it out

[2022-12-08 21:41:37] <Slavik_Odessit> @Klean Hi, do you have experience with the original game?
[2022-12-08 21:41:38] <BeefSupremeSenior> Sometimes, if you want to find gold, you just need to keep digging.
[2022-12-08 21:41:39] <de_charny> @ChiefStrongJaw this is the grandfather of rimworld
[2022-12-08 21:41:40] <+HavokReed> no, Rimworld is similar to this
[2022-12-08 21:41:40] <+macen> The "Godfather" of the genre if you would.
[2022-12-08 21:42:02] <bobthebobo3421684> whats so scary about the game?
[2022-12-08 21:42:12] <@%LoeVG> Ahh.. The guitar game seq1 GuitarTime
[2022-12-08 21:42:20] <+macen> @bobthebobo3421684 It doesn't have a learning curve. It has a learning cliff/mountain.
[2022-12-08 21:42:21] <%+WaldemarMjoeen> Chat, do you think Rimworld is much easier than DF?
[2022-12-08 21:42:29] <%BSDilly> @bobthebobo3421684 Its intricacy
[2022-12-08 21:42:31] <+macen> @WaldemarMjoeen 150%
[2022-12-08 21:42:31] <Grinbale> this game is actually for humans now lol
[2022-12-08 21:42:34] <Slavik_Odessit> @bobthebobo3421684 the learning curve is quite steep
[2022-12-08 21:42:34] <scydive> easier to play
[2022-12-08 21:42:48] <HowdyPhoenix> I've only played rimworld but i am interested in this game
[2022-12-08 21:43:10] <%+WaldemarMjoeen> Thanks for the inputs
[2022-12-08 21:43:23] <+Grimdewulf77> this music is amazing
[2022-12-08 21:43:27] <@%LoeVG> seqSus
[2022-12-08 21:43:28] <%+MrMcGrizzly> RimWorld is inspired by the game
[2022-12-08 21:43:34] <s_k_o_m> it's the granddaddy of this genre, rimworld on crack tbh. just deeper in most simulations, but all the more fun

[2022-12-08 21:43:45] <Captain__Reflex> is this game worth the price in your opinion ?
[2022-12-08 21:43:56] <%+WaldemarMjoeen> THe ASCII just made it a bit of a  relic to me earlier
[2022-12-08 21:44:01] <BeefSupremeSenior> In another chat, i saw someone put it like this; Rimworld is a game pretending to be a simulation, Dwarf Fortress is a simulation pretending to be a game
[2022-12-08 21:44:17] <BeefSupremeSenior> And i agree with that statement completely
[2022-12-08 21:44:34] <+tyrithe> LUL BeefSupremeSenior
[2022-12-08 21:44:35] <Captain__Reflex> @BeefSupremeSenior so is dwarf fortress really hard ?
[2022-12-08 21:44:46] <+macen> @HowdyPhoenix If you like rimworld you will love this game. It's much much kluge, but also so much "MORE". And I love rimworld.
[2022-12-08 21:44:59] <BeefSupremeSenior> @Captain__Reflex You can't win Dwarf Fortress, if that counts LUL
[2022-12-08 21:45:02] <+tyrithe> hard? no. complicated enough to make you want to just give up within the first hundred hours? yes.
[2022-12-08 21:45:02] <elishmidt> @Captain__Reflex there is an old free version on the bay 12 website. keep in mind this version is in ascii and harder to learn than this new steam version.

[2022-12-08 21:45:34] <junkfarmer> dig down and find some caverns that have mushroom trees
[2022-12-08 21:45:36] <scydive> you need a great dwal of imgination to play the non steam version
[2022-12-08 21:45:38] VIEWERS: 206
[2022-12-08 21:45:42] <Captain__Reflex> @Captain__Reflex yea id probably get it if I feel convinced enough
[2022-12-08 21:45:45] <%BSDilly> @Captain__Reflex A few hundred times more indepth than rimworld
[2022-12-08 21:45:46] <%+WaldemarMjoeen> I've never "won" RimWorld either, the stories are in taking chances, and that can lead to "defeat"
[2022-12-08 21:45:51] <%TungTobak> @Klean if you find losing is fun. Caves Of Qud is a banger
[2022-12-08 21:46:01] <Captain__Reflex> @BSDilly oh, thats insane, thats really appeaing to me
[2022-12-08 21:46:07] <scydive> CoQ is a banger of a game

[2022-12-08 21:46:39] <hammerdown44> didnt know there was others
[2022-12-08 21:46:47] <+macen> Dwarf fortress is a game about having "fun". You should go google what the term "Fun" means in the DF world.
[2022-12-08 21:46:47] <%ColeChiIls> YEP CoQ
[2022-12-08 21:47:00] <+NEON_ALIEN> @Klean hi bro

[2022-12-08 21:48:20] <BeefSupremeSenior> @scydive They got rid of the only way to control mutations, which makes the game not fun to me anymore. Get three useless mutations in a row and might aswel fight a pyramid and reroll
[2022-12-08 21:48:39] <%+WaldemarMjoeen> Did you beat Zero Sivert, or got tired of it?
[2022-12-08 21:48:44] <+hydro5403> so is this game like what rimworld was inspired by or vice versa

[2022-12-08 21:50:04] <mydadworksatTwitch> @hydro5403 dwarf fortress has been developed by 2 brothers since like the early 2000s, just more and more systems yet no official graphics or mouse til just now
[2022-12-08 21:50:10] <%+zHEIMz> wait so is this a new game or an old one?

[2022-12-08 22:22:05] <+ZayneD420> i watched for a ton of time and was so unsure if it would be fun to play, boy was it worth it
[2022-12-08 22:22:10] <+PassionStallion> I was just wondering how you think they compare if you had.
[2022-12-08 22:22:11] <teggydoe> cuz u built stairs on 2nd floor
[2022-12-08 22:22:15] <teggydoe> remove them
[2022-12-08 22:22:21] <teggydoe> then do the top to bottom stairs
[2022-12-08 22:22:26] <Puffy_Walrus> ive seen the not putting up down stairs
[2022-12-08 22:22:31] <+Lee_of_Lyres> yeah those stairs are fucked, they only lead up, so the dwarves can't poke through the floor to mine the layer below
[2022-12-08 22:22:36] <Puffy_Walrus> usually what it is
[2022-12-08 22:22:43] <cubes158> I think his stairs were fine, they just werent building them because they were busy mining out the rooms up top

[2022-12-08 22:23:02] <+Lee_of_Lyres> stairs are buggy in this version, it tries to smartly designate, but screws it up permanently now

[2022-12-08 22:51:15] <+Matienx> you play one dwarf in the map you create
[2022-12-08 22:51:24] <%Howkin_> one of the fun ''glitches'' with the ascii version is that if you changed the texture for some stuff that was showed as a letter, it could sometimes have the image apear instead of the letter in the UI
[2022-12-08 22:51:29] <teggydoe> u can harvest the plants to make beer
[2022-12-08 22:51:39] <+Matienx> @Ghoulsie its like a lil rougue like

[2022-12-08 23:16:58] <+DeadlyDays> it will auto seperate them

[2022-12-08 23:54:23] <+Superfreaken> you can make your dining hall and meeting place the same place! just place it over the top of the dining hall!
[2022-12-08 23:54:26] <szu_the_snake> Typical dwarfs lmao
[2022-12-08 23:54:29] <Z_ynthia> @Klean if u ahve a dead body u can use a coffin, but if u have a dwarf drown or sth u need slabs since u cant recover the body
[2022-12-08 23:54:30] <derped_up> Make a large room, designate it as meeting pplace, set tables+ seat + statues and engrave the walls and floor
[2022-12-08 23:54:35] <!%Sacriel> temple is the same as tavern, make a room, use z, set it to meeting place, then define it as a temple in the same menu top left
[2022-12-08 23:54:41] <derped_up> = happy dwarfs

[2022-12-08 23:55:25] <!%Sacriel> you can play for a thousand hours and dragon might turn up and Smaug your whole place in 60 seconds
[2022-12-08 23:55:25] <!%Slushpuppy> death is not the end, just the start of another journey lol
[2022-12-08 23:56:04] <!%Sacriel> yeah if youn reroll another colony you might find the dragon that killed your first one and defeat him to take back your old lands

[2022-12-08 23:56:33] <%Howkin_> you can make a temple for all the gods until they start asking for seperate temples
[2022-12-08 23:56:40] <!%RoyaleWithCheeseTV> I’m learning so much! kleanGasm
[2022-12-08 23:56:46] <!%Slushpuppy> @derped_up i do want to, sick af atm though
[2022-12-08 23:56:50] <!%Sacriel> an easy fix is just 10x10 room, set as meeting place, set as temple - thats it
[2022-12-08 23:56:53] <%+TheAlbinoShow> Dralitha are elephant-sized according to the wiki
[2022-12-08 23:56:54] <+Sdwaggy> Book Keeper "Poor analytical ability" XD
[2022-12-08 23:56:56] <!%Sacriel> you can pick a relgiion or do generic which is 100x easier
[2022-12-08 23:57:09] <!%Sacriel> i have like 11 seperate churches in my place, i wish i had made one big generic one

[2022-12-08 23:58:17] <!%Sacriel> important to airlock those long stairwells, you might get like 10 trolls come flying up your stairs and fuck you up real quick
[2022-12-08 23:59:21] <!%Slushpuppy> you'll learn one 10 trolls fuck you up lol
[2022-12-08 23:59:28] <%ForsaikenRedskye> FeelsRainMan
[2022-12-08 23:59:30] <!%Slushpuppy> once*
[2022-12-08 23:59:32] <derped_up> also "explore" the caverns there could be water there
[2022-12-08 23:59:37] <!%Sacriel> instead of having one stairwell that goes down 20 levels, go down 10 levels, then dig sideways, and do another 10 levels of stairs, put some iron dorrs between them
[2022-12-08 23:59:42] <Trogderpinator> If you go to doors etc. you'll see something you can build to put over your stair entrances.
[2022-12-08 23:59:43] <@%SpottedTango> @Klean good idea to get your stonecrafter / mason making stone blocks for wall building -- free exp for him and they move quicker with blocks than they do with boulders! plus they make more blocks out of one boulder. Stonemason also makes toys for kids
[2022-12-08 23:59:50] <Burepishta> pepeJAM GuitarTime
[2022-12-08 23:59:51] <!%Sacriel> so if mobs from the deep wanna attack, they have to break the doors down to get up
[2022-12-08 23:59:51] <fur3x> Just had my first decent run in DF reached 90 pop and these fucking werewolfs kept popping up and slaughtering people KEKW
[2022-12-08 23:59:55] <derped_up> brides and levers to make an airlock
