[2023-01-02 16:02:48] <fluffykoromo> hi everyone
[2023-01-02 16:03:25] <@%phuckingmagikal> I still think if there's going to be an expansion explosion deck, this is it

[2023-01-02 16:03:51] <@%Marvoleath> !suggest Expansion//Explosion
[2023-01-02 16:03:51] <@^MTGBot> Dear MTGO User AspiringSpike: I noticed your decklist does not contain the Magic: the Gathering card Expansion//Explosion. To me, this is a grievous oversight that must be immediately rectified. Please add this card to your deck forthwith or I will be left with no recourse but to unfollow. Again, the card I am suggesting you add is Expansion//Explosion. Thank You.
[2023-01-02 16:03:52] <@%+esqpoe> any thought of 2x quicken in this deck?
[2023-01-02 16:03:55] <%RaupptimusPrime> theres so much sauce here holy cow

[2023-01-02 16:04:13] <@^MTGBot> No, we haven't figured out how to win with infinite turns yet but let's take random game actions and see what happens.
[2023-01-02 16:04:15] <Klossi815> i may be stupid but how does opponent life go to 0? just the 2 manlands and copying lightning bolts?
[2023-01-02 16:04:19] <Psycho_Cyan> doesn't galvanic not work with invoke?
[2023-01-02 16:04:24] <Psycho_Cyan> since you cast both of the spells at the same time?
[2023-01-02 16:04:29] <Matte8pt> thank god Spike exists
[2023-01-02 16:04:31] <Snarwin> But how do we win with infinite turns?
[2023-01-02 16:04:44] <@%phuckingmagikal> You can activate den of the bug bear 30 times with the mana gotten from braids and then just swing
[2023-01-02 16:04:46] <singto12> dwarfen mine an option?

[2023-01-02 16:57:16] <snapcasterbolt> Feels like mystical teachings is generically good in this shell (splash watery grave over breeding pool), would love to see a 1x of (maybe over the 4th fact). Can get invoke, nexus, etc. With braid seems pretty nice.
[2023-01-02 16:57:20] <snapcasterbolt> (sorry if already suggested)
[2023-01-02 16:57:26] <Lock1102> invoke now so they wont draw a counterspell?
[2023-01-02 16:57:32] <Dunastar> @snapcasterbolt rhis
[2023-01-02 16:57:36] <Psycho_Cyan> we can copy hall of storm giants with fable  ;)
[2023-01-02 16:57:36] <Dunastar> this
[2023-01-02 16:57:38] <%+matteosartorii> Bitter reunion could be good
[2023-01-02 16:57:43] <@FourDogsInAHorseSuit> It's the best red card in the format behind Rag and DRC.

[2023-01-02 16:57:49] <Psycho_Cyan> (I know it would enter tapped as a non-creature)
[2023-01-02 16:57:53] <galactuskev> is fable an instant chat?

[2023-01-02 16:58:10] <Psycho_Cyan> and isn't a creature IIRC
[2023-01-02 16:58:15] <+Padreterno87> is treasure vault too narrow to transform braid mana and help with savor turns?
[2023-01-02 16:58:18] <%+K_dorse> Fable gives you a 2/2 to win with infinite turns though.
[2023-01-02 16:58:20] <Hal9004> have you considered adding DRC, Bauble, Murktide, Ragavan, Counterspell, Spell Pierce, Consider...
[2023-01-02 16:58:22] <%Fleecemane34> this deck needs Ral Zarek
[2023-01-02 16:58:25] <%+K_dorse> Otherwise you can’t win

[2023-01-02 18:38:37] <%+jgscore> Hey Spike, hoping to ask you a favor - I watch your streams at night a lot before bed. I super appreciate you doing deck tecs, but they're really bright when trying to fall asleep - Can you use darkmode by chance?

[2023-01-02 18:51:31] <adamy23> @unimpressedinfernape yeah the idea was it’d eventually kill you if you couldn’t use the mana

[2023-01-02 20:16:41] <+Lightningman375> Spike, can i redeem channel points for a kamigawa block constructed tiny leaders deck?
[2023-01-02 20:16:41] <DeadByCutie> Jokes on you opponent, we got another moon lol
[2023-01-02 20:16:44] <HugHeist> 1v1 edh with no commander and a points system instead of a banlist
[2023-01-02 20:16:46] <ElDeadMann> canlander is neat
[2023-01-02 20:16:52] <$FancyFish21> @aspiringspike the biggest brain play was ostone a blood moon
[2023-01-02 20:16:53] <Parole_MTG> Probably was better to discard the moon rather than the remand though. Given you can't win if you cast it.

[2023-01-02 20:17:01] <@%^MTGBot> Help support Spike's new home purchase. For just $10, he will tell you he does not do donation deck.
[2023-01-02 20:17:08] <+kynsareth> 100 cards, vintage banlist, and a point system on restricted cards. Honestly a very well curated and maintained format
[2023-01-02 20:17:09] <+TauNeutrino2> yeah fate counter on the blood moon would have just won for them I think?
[2023-01-02 20:17:15] <TheTunnelingCat> best way to think of canlander for an outsider looking in is like a constructed cube deck
[2023-01-02 20:17:27] <yolando115> Can I take a look at the canlander deck
[2023-01-02 20:17:39] <Handerstone> Well, if you get them down to burn range, you might be able to jam the Moon

There are a limited number of channel point deck techs available each stream but you can always dono or gift 3 subs! donations accepted here: https://streamlabs.com/aspiringspike/tip

[2023-01-02 20:17:59] <+mattmanw2> What about Dandan deck techs?
[2023-01-02 20:18:05] <+TauNeutrino2> it's pretty rare as tron that you want to *keep* the blood moon though yeah
[2023-01-02 20:18:06] <%+RobBovill> hey Spike! if I play 4x Liquimetal Coating, can I play 4x Kolaghan's Command?
