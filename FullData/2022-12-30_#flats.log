[2022-12-30 00:09:56] <RxRexBoy> question just started watching whats kekw?
[2022-12-30 00:09:57] <VirtualDova> we must test every rock on every map
[2022-12-30 00:09:57] <thepacman313> SCIENCE
[2022-12-30 00:10:00] <baldcapedguy> VERY INTERESTING
[2022-12-30 00:10:01] <%xsansthecomic> flats ur teammate was going on bout how he does a 9-5 shift and he had to deal with you 🤣
[2022-12-30 00:10:02] <kilo_g_1337> @flats you just got junk removed
[2022-12-30 00:10:05] <baldcapedguy> IM GLAD I WAS WATCHINT THAT

[2022-12-30 00:10:08] <starlitta> try with torb torret
[2022-12-30 00:10:08] <Leo_HMD> I love flats lobbies if I did that I’d die all the time lmao
[2022-12-30 00:10:09] <placiusky> flats play with me plsss
[2022-12-30 00:10:09] <bathman_1998> SeemsGood
[2022-12-30 00:10:11] <JAR9head7> Its cause it is a slip trigger rock. since you can't stand on the rock itself the trap just says nah.
[2022-12-30 00:10:11] <+ailieff> i think it should roll over to the surface
[2022-12-30 00:10:13] DELETED: placiusky (flats play with me plsss)
[2022-12-30 00:10:14] <+adamftk> do u think zarya grav would fall thru that rock too?
[2022-12-30 00:10:14] <starlitta> or anas nade
[2022-12-30 00:10:14] <kilo_g_1337> no more junk until rocks can be trapped
[2022-12-30 00:10:14] <CooLitten> what are the chances of you finding that?
[2022-12-30 00:10:15] <tripletwoo> Wait til you test out the other rocks in life
[2022-12-30 00:10:17] <VirtualDova> FOR SCIENCE HUZZAH
[2022-12-30 00:10:18] <RealDane> certain rocks or all rocks in the game do this?
[2022-12-30 00:10:18] <thepacman313> EWWWWWWWWWWWW PUSH

[2022-12-30 00:10:19] <%+Afthotstreak719> @Flats i wonder if it works for a torb turret
[2022-12-30 00:10:19] <%anebody> do roofs do the same thing? Probably just the geometry
[2022-12-30 00:10:20] <conte_verdi> lets find other spots on other map that might do that
[2022-12-30 00:10:22] <@%flyingfish1230> @placiusky aint gonna happen
[2022-12-30 00:10:22] <TheStellarMender> why are ramattras pants like that
[2022-12-30 00:10:23] <%yawnslaught> i would assume its any surface you can't stand on?
[2022-12-30 00:10:25] <%Ari0n0s> Im curious if it eats other things tbh , maybe needs work
[2022-12-30 00:10:26] <+ailieff> instead of going away
[2022-12-30 00:10:30] <L4zarusOW> @xsansthecomic lmfao glad i wasn not the only one who saw , only on OW

[2022-12-30 01:44:17] <hippityhoppityhoho> JQ and Zarya need a mini buff
[2022-12-30 01:44:17] <doctor_sour> I really miss enjoying this game, they messed it up so bad that it’s just a character swap fest now. I wish you were character locked from the start of the match
[2022-12-30 01:44:21] <+shmagey9380> !watchtime
[2022-12-30 01:44:22] <%+Gibson7202> This game is basically what happened to me the past 4 games of comp and I lost
[2022-12-30 01:44:25] <iddqds_son> its hitscan like the people with bullets

[2022-12-30 01:44:42] <HangryDragon12> 0s cooldown on the screen? anyone else notice that before or just me?
[2022-12-30 01:44:52] <AllenAndArt> Ramm is so much fun
[2022-12-30 01:44:59] <%LegendaryMach13> Gold gun on that skin looks dope
[2022-12-30 01:44:59] <%+bazelboi> Ram is very fun
[2022-12-30 01:45:01] <hippityhoppityhoho> they should change comp so you can only stay one hero the whole match
[2022-12-30 01:45:02] <robh7_> sig needs a better shield
[2022-12-30 01:45:04] <cuefvce> kiriko gonna get a suzu nerf for sure
[2022-12-30 01:45:06] <+stoonkey> his ult i super fun imo

[2022-12-30 01:45:26] <cuefvce> the cooldown on suzu is too short
[2022-12-30 01:45:33] <vizzzion123> LOL

[2022-12-30 01:46:12] <%+dal908> i find it so funny that there is only one time ball is ever played in gm
[2022-12-30 01:46:12] <doctor_sour> Yeah counter swap is dumb, imagine getting counter swapped mid match and the kid thinks he’s actually good.
[2022-12-30 01:46:13] <hippityhoppityhoho> @DarqPhoenix no, but think about how much more fun the game would be. youd choose the heroes you WANT to play, not the ones just to counter
[2022-12-30 01:46:13] <iddqds_son> nerf genji
[2022-12-30 01:46:14] <+leftkarma2> Wait are you playing comp?

[2022-12-30 01:48:12] <%+Gibson7202> Dont worry guys, Blizzard said the other team will also have a similar sr/mmr player in the future which doesnt fix the issue at hand but atleast its "fair"

[2022-12-30 01:49:23] <%StephaneLevs> @doctor_sour in fighting game, you can swap, you usually do best out of 3 or 5... that's also very different from a 5vs5 game...
[2022-12-30 01:49:23] <DarqPhoenix> @robh7_ not true in the slightest
[2022-12-30 01:49:27] <Chroll0Lucifer> does her javelin even have cooldowns lol
[2022-12-30 01:49:28] <doctor_sour> But the mechanic in question is what I’m showing an example of. It’s ridiculous and just needs to be removed

[2022-12-30 01:49:55] <oknoarguement> @hippityhoppityhoho thats just going to make the counterswap situation a rock paper scissors for the first 30 seconds
[2022-12-30 01:49:57] <%supersayzin> GET'EM

[2022-12-30 01:50:58] <%StephaneLevs> @hippityhoppityhoho I guess if you can see before it might be better but I dont know, it still sounds like a bad idea to me. The biggest problem with counter swap now is that there is almost no downside (you still keep a huge chunk of ult)

[2022-12-30 02:06:05] <%$jasonwocky> "true rank" is typically stored as 2 numbers in games: a "rating" and a "certainty". Players who haven't played in awhile don't lose "rating" but probably lose certainty so it means Blizzard has to guess

[2022-12-30 02:10:53] <%+kiiwiiwaffle> Is Flats playing with someone, or has he just been getting lucky with the Mercy pockets?
[2022-12-30 02:10:55] <unironicallybritish> can't ramattra and doom block some of sigma ult DMG by blocking looking up? or was that bs?
[2022-12-30 02:10:59] <%$jasonwocky> @DayZ3R0_ it's definitely annoying but it's kind of part of the package when you play with randos
[2022-12-30 02:11:00] <a_witcher> he is the baseline for a good tank rn
[2022-12-30 02:11:04] <+gotdamitbobbi> Is winton bubble still optimal against ram ult?
[2022-12-30 02:11:07] <%+Gibson7202> @nappyalfredo I disagree, it 100% makes you a better player because if you do bad you can learn from it and if someone is better you can study what they do that outplays you (besides mechanical skill ofc); QP is really for learning the game, getting better mechanical skills, and warming up imo

[2022-12-30 02:32:58] <@%^StreamElements> When Flats was in high school he joined the football team. Within his first week there, someone else on the team ended up crossing a line and pissing Flats off. Flats flattened the kid with his 6ft body, thus earning him the nickname "Flats" since "Flatten" sounds stupid.

[2022-12-30 02:47:06] <%LordNuggett> Horrible take: Make hog drop the hook if he misses so he need to go get it
[2022-12-30 02:47:07] <CrowQueenAMPS> @tablehermit Yes. When you use your alt on an exploding mech, it counts as that much mitigation.

[2022-12-30 02:47:11] <LiterallyAMeme> @tablehermit yes it is and the cause is known; It's caused by Ana nanoing D.Va as her mech dies

[2022-12-30 02:48:34] <+Paradigmshift080> @grunglegunk that was funny lol idk why they deleted it
[2022-12-30 02:48:34] <ghosttoohigh> Yeah when they remove one shots besides widow and hanzo it’ll be a better game
[2022-12-30 02:48:35] <eebreeze> They should make Ana’s ult blow up everyone’s pc, I think that’d be a good buff
