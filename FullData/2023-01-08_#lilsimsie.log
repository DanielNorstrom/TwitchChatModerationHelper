[2023-01-08 00:00:01] <%$justabby20> Is the lemonade stand from the sims store or did it come with generations?
[2023-01-08 00:00:01] <shortmusicianL> what else is in ambitions?
[2023-01-08 00:00:01] <%$bts_loona> and then a bunch of y'all voted to have laundry in the sims 4 in that survey :(
[2023-01-08 00:00:03] <+xemily330> @iffy_m the same as sims4
[2023-01-08 00:00:03] <Applecrystals> i think its bc laundrymats came with ambitions
[2023-01-08 00:00:05] <Cryia_RX> !Time
[2023-01-08 00:00:06] <%ferretinasweater> I LOVED the kids stove
[2023-01-08 00:00:12] <+xemily330> I miss the toy stove so much!
[2023-01-08 00:00:14] <SummerSimz> @justabby20 Sims 3 Store I believe

[2023-01-08 00:00:22] <batsandbabydolls> Lemonade Stand is Ambitions I think
[2023-01-08 00:00:24] <Applecrystals> like more stores and building became available with ambitions
[2023-01-08 00:00:27] <alaurel17> there was definitely some kind of food stand not from the store because i always used it
[2023-01-08 00:00:31] <+xemily330> did she get promoted again?
[2023-01-08 00:00:31] <%$jen_sim> so epic lol
[2023-01-08 00:00:32] <SimtanicStudios> If I remember correctly, the kids stove could also catch fire

[2023-01-08 00:00:50] <batsandbabydolls> that might be what I'm thinking of then

[2023-01-08 00:00:52] <Skollhati_> hey everyone
[2023-01-08 00:00:53] <%ferretinasweater> the lemonade stand was store, but the bakery table was ambitions

[2023-01-08 00:01:13] <%Sammiskate> Never really understood why people have been so outraged by kits when Sims 3 did the exact same thing with the store. Not like it was a new idea.

[2023-01-08 00:03:16] <%missrileybear> If you really want a challenge try the sims 3 lepacy challenge where you start with just the base game and then you add pack content in chronological order with each generation
[2023-01-08 00:03:21] <ImJakeDeason> and sims 4 multitasking isn't good either
[2023-01-08 00:03:22] <Skollhati_> its so weird to see similar tiles in the kitchen and bathroom to me

[2023-01-08 00:06:41] <@%ItIsDanya> @plantsy I loved the bands and I loved the idea of my sim being a drummer
[2023-01-08 00:06:45] <Grobgobglobgrod__> you can currently do anything you can think of in sims 4 with mods

[2023-01-08 00:07:51] <@brewwin> also like its a bit culturally insensitive to roleplay makng a hotel on a 'island' i think just like generic resort locations or being able to pu them anywhere... much better. i mean white lotus lol

[2023-01-08 00:08:05] <batsandbabydolls> there's a mod that stops inactive sims from moving their houseboats and that helps with the lag in Isla Paradiso a *little* bit but it's still PRETTY bad

[2023-01-08 00:15:53] <$clairebear__> @spookybooze I feel like it depends on what games you have cause I've heard people have problems with their older sims games showing up in the EA app, but if you only have sims 4 it's less of an issue

[2023-01-08 00:28:09] <+actuallyalwaysalex> covid doesn't yet but the flu vaccine you can get without needles. you just inhale it
[2023-01-08 00:28:10] <talvikkixo> This is a genuine question, I’m just interested, how much do horses and cars cost?

[2023-01-08 00:31:30] <%+Marvel_SPN_Lover> Once I got the flu and the Covid vaccine at the same time, on my birthday. it was missable...I didn't think it would be that bad, I was so wrong

[2023-01-08 00:35:16] <Rextheraptorboi> I only found your channel this week. Kinda glad I don’t know what happened lol
[2023-01-08 00:35:17] <%+belovedjasmine> I tried to sign up for the RSV vaccine trial at University of Washington, but was disqualified by my migraines

[2023-01-08 00:35:20] <smallest_turtle> I work with children irl it was so awful
[2023-01-08 00:35:20] <%justRayxox> I hope what I said wasnt considered antivax. I completely think that people should get vaccinated but I am afraid of the flu one. I am fully vaccinated against covid

[2023-01-08 00:35:21] <%+caitb123> It was awful back then. No antivaxers allowed here.
[2023-01-08 00:35:22] <stryder240> honestly, yes they are lol
[2023-01-08 00:35:23] <fod9011> Antivaxxers should get a life.. and some education
[2023-01-08 00:35:26] <%little_miss_anxiety> i live in an area where unfortunately the majority of people are antivaxxers and everyday i get looked at disgustingly for wearing a mask and wanting to stay healthy

[2023-01-08 00:41:35] <phantombree> It’s not an opinion, it’s a denial of facts

[2023-01-08 00:41:43] <samikaysays> kayla is absolutely correct
[2023-01-08 00:41:44] <themacussy> endangering lives is NOT an opinion

[2023-01-08 00:41:45] <%+em_claire14> its a difference of morals
[2023-01-08 00:41:45] <magpie_life> It’s also really dangerous to not get vaccinated, there are people who can’t get vaccinated and are immunocompromised
[2023-01-08 00:41:47] <$sarahmallory> true
[2023-01-08 00:41:48] <%$brindleton_bae> No one likes actually going for a vaccine, I hate needles but personally I think you are selfish if you can and choose not to
[2023-01-08 00:41:48] <shortmusicianL> it's not opinion it's morals
[2023-01-08 00:41:50] <%$piscespossumprincess> public health is public!!!! someone's antivax opinions kill people!!
[2023-01-08 00:41:50] <%+colourofmagik> Exactly it’s not a debate it’s fact vaccines save lives
[2023-01-08 00:41:50] <artheliet> exactly
[2023-01-08 00:41:51] <%+birb_ross> Refusing a vaccine is even worse than refusing a seatbelt, because others can be hurt if you’re not vaccinated.
[2023-01-08 00:41:51] <%Dawnie3296> Totally!
[2023-01-08 00:41:51] <bizzylizzylu> saying "I dont GAF about anyone else but me" isnt an opinion its just being a terrible person
[2023-01-08 00:41:52] <%elli0205> makes sense

[2023-01-08 00:41:55] <+zachattack705> measles becoming a problem again shows it's not a diff of opinion!  it affects everyone
[2023-01-08 00:41:55] <SummerSimz> My daughter & I are high risk & we need the vaccines
[2023-01-08 00:41:56] <%$lolabugge> I blame Andrew Wakefield and Jenny McCarthy for poisoning people against vaccines
[2023-01-08 00:41:56] <admiral_mittensx> Makes total sense. You’re 100% right.

[2023-01-08 00:42:00] <torijk> I’ve had as many vaccines as I can. I still caught covid and it’s weakened my lungs. I now live with severe asthma 😞

[2023-01-08 00:42:04] <neytella> I broke up with my ex because of that exact "difference of opinion" xD

[2023-01-08 00:42:14] <Jeanieus> this discussion just reminded me about how I just zoned out when I found out a friend of mine was dating a serious flat earther
[2023-01-08 00:42:14] <demented_bunbun> I normally am a person that says “it only effects you, its up to you what you do with your body”…. But the problem is that it doesn’t only effect you, not vaccinating effects and endangers everyone.
[2023-01-08 00:42:14] <fangsup> not getting vaccinated isnt an opinion, its an action
[2023-01-08 00:42:15] <@brewwin> EXACTLY

[2023-01-08 00:42:18] <%kamiskin> Also refusing to believe in basic science and medicine is not a difference of opinion.

[2023-01-08 00:42:24] <atbmommyof3> Not all opinions are valid either. People can have an opinion on how I raise my kids, but it doesn’t make their opinions valid.
[2023-01-08 00:42:24] <+piggeesmalls> I just got over covid after avoiding it for 2 years because my husband's new coworkers are anti vaxxers. it was the most sick I've ever been because other people were careless.

[2023-01-08 00:46:34] <cekaycada> is all the toddler stuff like the walker and playpen from a sims 3 expansion?

[2023-01-08 00:46:55] <SummerSimz> @cekaycada That’s store content
[2023-01-08 00:46:57] <ednasnightie> She might not be able to access more than one side of the playpen
[2023-01-08 00:47:01] <AntonioE777> first 7 toddlers and now this
[2023-01-08 00:47:03] <+TCMR21> I've always loved the daycare career. I hope they add it to TS4 when they do the infants update.
[2023-01-08 00:47:09] <SummerSimz> How did you get store content to stay installed in your game? Mine uninstalls randomly
[2023-01-08 00:47:11] <moniquesylvie> I went to a thrift store today and found the sims one and two I was ECSTATIC

[2023-01-08 00:48:18] <$julraine> i hope this month
[2023-01-08 00:48:20] <Grobgobglobgrod__> doggo is so cute
[2023-01-08 00:48:21] <carlapotatoe> i can't play sims I'm on mobile and switch :'(
[2023-01-08 00:48:24] <+xemily330> it's early 2023 dang it! /j
[2023-01-08 00:48:24] <SummerSimz> Sims 4 infant update is going to make the game feel so much better!
[2023-01-08 00:48:24] <%muzenqlkajqm7dude> when do you think infants will be released?
[2023-01-08 00:48:29] <+wondair> Are they just going to drop it randomly one day like they did with the toddler update? LUL
[2023-01-08 00:48:30] <shortmusicianL> that could literally mean tomorrow or in like 3 months

Suggestions are always appreciated, but do not attempt to make demands or force Kayla to do anything. There is a difference between friendly suggestions and aggressive demands. Ultimately she is the one playing the game, not you! simsieNo
[2023-01-08 00:48:42] <%+marijnslays> omg what if a generation ep will come with it, and running a daycare would be one of the features
[2023-01-08 00:48:42] <%sageternal> maybe i'll get it as a birthday present as my bday is in february
[2023-01-08 00:48:44] <karenam7> Would've been so funny if they dropped it on New Years Day. Like, "we said EARLY!"
[2023-01-08 00:48:46] <ImJakeDeason> good night

[2023-01-08 00:48:51] <$sarahmallory> do you think they add a daycare career again?
[2023-01-08 00:48:55] <xViolet_Sunshinex> Less than 5 months for sure
[2023-01-08 00:48:56] <%kamiskin> @little_miss_anxiety I think itll be whoever livds in the pumpkin
[2023-01-08 00:49:00] <themacussy> i hope the infant update works well with occults

[2023-01-08 00:49:05] <SummerSimz> Is CC bad for your game? I want to download more cc buy stuff but I’m worried it’ll ruin my Sims 3/4 game
[2023-01-08 00:49:07] <+xemily330> ballet is so cute in this
[2023-01-08 00:49:10] <%little_miss_anxiety> @kamiskin im hoping for the fairy godmother tbh
[2023-01-08 00:49:12] <%$Plourde4> It depends how you view the months. The way i see it is Early is Jan-April

[2023-01-08 00:49:18] <%+snowy_flake> i would love it if they did
[2023-01-08 00:49:19] <%$grunklz> do you think we'll hear more before the update drops?
[2023-01-08 00:49:23] <+wondair> Could happen this Monday, could happen end of May
[2023-01-08 00:49:23] <%mplaczkiewicz> Isn't there a babysitter part time jon?
[2023-01-08 00:49:27] <%+liza_lou_18> i havent watched in a while but im finally watching again
[2023-01-08 00:49:28] <%+tabaxii> i want a more similar generations pack pls
[2023-01-08 00:49:34] <l0ve_l3y> either they give us a daycare update or update the babysitter part time job would be nice too
[2023-01-08 00:49:38] <%+snowy_flake> i wonder if we'll get a roadmap soon
[2023-01-08 00:49:40] <%Cozy_Gamer8> To me “early 2023” means Q1
[2023-01-08 00:49:41] <batsandbabydolls> if they release a pack alongside the infant update, it would make sense to have a daycare career in it
[2023-01-08 00:49:43] <talvikkixo> Can you see the kid doing ballet if u sign them up?
[2023-01-08 00:49:47] <%kamiskin> @little_miss_anxiety I would love her! I also really want Repunzel and Flynn too
[2023-01-08 00:49:47] <karenam7> @Cozy_Gamer8 Same
[2023-01-08 00:49:47] <%$itisalex05> for some reason whenever simsie says jack my mind goes to jack antonoff (music producer)
[2023-01-08 00:49:49] <%+marijnslays> yeah like a roadmap with some more kits too
[2023-01-08 00:49:49] <@%+MrsTomato101814> i want it nowwww
[2023-01-08 00:49:50] <%+katcasey17> I’d love to have a daycare career in the sims 4
[2023-01-08 00:49:52] <%+WillowCreekWanderer> I assumed early meant first quarter but idk
[2023-01-08 00:49:53] <carlapotatoe> I hate how I'm stuck with sims Freeplay :)
[2023-01-08 00:49:58] <%$samanthaverb> That makes sense
[2023-01-08 00:49:59] <%+swiftie198> Maybe the anniversary?
[2023-01-08 00:50:01] <+annieveronica> @grunklz i hope so! id rather get excited about infants first and then look forward to the day it drops haha
[2023-01-08 00:50:02] <+AllieGSims> I hope they give us a changing table
[2023-01-08 00:50:04] <$julraine> i hope not but i think they'll release the infants for free and then make a pack for them
[2023-01-08 00:50:05] <%+Loud_Lara> I've always thought I'd would either be announced or out by the end of first quater
[2023-01-08 00:50:05] <%$justju234> @carlapotatoe the sims 4 is free
[2023-01-08 00:50:06] <+jenkendar1984> Have they posted a roadmap yet for this year?
[2023-01-08 00:50:07] <%little_miss_anxiety> @kamiskin yes!!!!! that would be AMAZING
[2023-01-08 00:50:08] <+xemily330> @talvikkixo they can practice their moves but it isn't active career

[2023-01-08 00:50:27] <%42hitch42> ruff
[2023-01-08 00:50:27] <themacussy> i hope they don't just release it without warning like with toddlers

[2023-01-08 00:50:49] <%little_miss_anxiety> dont they do a series of releases in jan-march?
[2023-01-08 00:50:54] <SummerSimz> Can’t *
[2023-01-08 00:50:56] <%plantsy> when was the last roadmap? i was in the woods for a little bit and missed a few months of sims news
[2023-01-08 00:50:59] <%+snowy_flake> the roadmap is when you leave the house someting will be released
[2023-01-08 00:51:00] <%$itisalex05> just make random plans, then we'll know when they're releasing stuff!
[2023-01-08 00:51:00] <kiwi824> @carlapotatoe I know your pain :(
[2023-01-08 00:51:04] <honest_jackson> Wonder when they’ll release a roadmap
[2023-01-08 00:51:07] <Applecrystals> @SummerSimz most of the cc i download is from tumblr and modthesims. those sites have generally safe cc. i also download cc in chunks and have multiple copies of my save files in case of any corruption
[2023-01-08 00:51:08] <%heatherlouise_> What do you think of the teaser pics for the new worlds?
[2023-01-08 00:51:08] <%$justju234> i want a major bug fix overload before a pack
[2023-01-08 00:51:13] <%$brindleton_bae> Just think about any major life events you have coming up, that’s when it’ll drop
[2023-01-08 00:51:13] <+AllieGSims> Should I order a pizza tonight
[2023-01-08 00:51:14] <%+brindletonfae> quick go to the post office
[2023-01-08 00:51:14] <carlapotatoe> I think they might do a roadmap soon
[2023-01-08 00:51:18] <xViolet_Sunshinex> @AllieGSims I would think they'd have to. What would be the point of adding infants if they aren't gonna add any furniture associated with caring for them?
[2023-01-08 00:51:19] <%$Plourde4> i Don't think they do road maps in Jan. They don't tend to release anything major in Jan
[2023-01-08 00:51:20] <officiallycami> Hey Lilsimsie
[2023-01-08 00:51:22] <%tatyaniaw> hopefully the infant update comes soon

[2023-01-08 00:51:29] <bizzylizzylu> simssummit was kinda a roadmap

[2023-01-08 00:52:21] <%+WillowCreekWanderer> they probably haven't decided on a release date because they don't know when you're gonna be out of town /j

[2023-01-08 00:52:28] <%+kiemurphy20> by the way, your posted vod that your streamed Jan 3rd has the wrong year in the title on youtube
[2023-01-08 00:52:32] <shortmusicianL> so it could be next friday i guess
[2023-01-08 00:52:33] <honest_jackson> People are speculating the picture simguru ninja tweeted with the scythe is hinting at a grim reaper game pack, because that was one of the things they suggested when they were doing the community voted pack stuff (like an active grim reaper career)
[2023-01-08 00:52:33] <%$samanthaverb> Do you think they would surprise drop it?
[2023-01-08 00:52:35] <OrganicCannedMonster95> Lol
[2023-01-08 00:52:36] <%$alaurel17> we joke....but it could work
[2023-01-08 00:52:37] <+jenkendar1984> If they release influence on January 13, it’ll be Friday the 13th
[2023-01-08 00:52:37] <%$Plourde4> that is true. But usually companies stay away from Jan releases. Plus i think they'll launch with an EP
[2023-01-08 00:52:37] <%+Kchristmas12> My bday is Jan 12 haha

[2023-01-08 00:56:56] <%+Randomly_Sammy01> @cozy_gamer8 I was joking but, I wouldn't put it past them to do that with another feature...
[2023-01-08 00:56:57] <%$Plourde4> Infants are terrifying. So i wouldn't be surprised by a death from them
[2023-01-08 00:56:58] <sot7796> My first funeral stuff pack
[2023-01-08 00:56:58] <%sirmixnone> Death by infant
[2023-01-08 00:56:59] <%+pIushiemi> kayla your headphones area really cute
[2023-01-08 00:57:05] <katiebugthethug> I miss school busses in the sims 4 lol
[2023-01-08 00:57:06] <flufflovestoby> @bluberryoh the thing is i dont like old looking games and it does look very.... old
[2023-01-08 00:57:08] <honest_jackson> Graveyard lot type!
[2023-01-08 00:57:12] <%+alliekayy43> have any of the sims games had funerals?
[2023-01-08 00:57:13] <%kamiskin> The more I think about the the more Im actually loving the idea of a death themes pack
[2023-01-08 00:57:13] <carlapotatoe> just casually talking about funerals :/
[2023-01-08 00:57:13] <nuclearrainbo> do you ever get the grim reaper to join your household? 😂
[2023-01-08 00:57:15] <SummerSimz> Hope they wouldn’t be glitched like wedding stories
[2023-01-08 00:57:15] <$julraine> the infants are deadly apparently
[2023-01-08 00:57:16] <%Missygirl93> Maybe Grim post mean funerals\
[2023-01-08 00:57:16] <%+malloryeilleen> dave pls explain
[2023-01-08 00:57:18] <unemployedgarfield> yumm im hungry
[2023-01-08 00:57:18] <gravyyy_00> Knowing them tho they’ll probably give us barely anything and then a pack to get more stuff for the infacts
[2023-01-08 00:57:18] <Applecrystals> did cleo ever get you gems
[2023-01-08 00:57:20] <veganmama> im wondering about preteens and an elder update w those teaser pictures of the costume jewelry and dentures
[2023-01-08 00:57:20] <+actuallyalwaysalex> I bet it would be behind a pay wall if it were possible. it probably just changes the base game too much so it has to go to everyone
[2023-01-08 00:57:22] <%$itisalex05> it could be interesting, updating the beginning and the end of a sim's lifespan
[2023-01-08 00:57:22] <themacussy> no bc i would be so excited if there was a grim reaper career
[2023-01-08 00:57:22] <%+coeurdechoeur> I would love to get funerals and graveyards
[2023-01-08 00:57:22] <katiebugthethug> I miss school busses and I miss carpools!

[2023-01-08 00:57:24] <$Popcorn_Fairy7> generations would be a really big pack. if so
[2023-01-08 00:57:25] <froggyballs101> Wait who teased huh?
[2023-01-08 00:57:27] <Jeanieus> maybe it is a death related to like infant furniture
[2023-01-08 00:57:32] <%ARomanticAce> it was such a bummer that we didn't get a graveyard lot type with paranormal stuff, but the haunted house lot trait is also fun
[2023-01-08 00:57:35] <JaimieCat> It would be nice if weddings worked before they add another gathering event!
[2023-01-08 00:57:38] <%$Plourde4> I mean if we get a generationspack. It would make sense to have funerals
[2023-01-08 00:57:38] <+jenkendar1984> Did someone pee on the front porch?
[2023-01-08 00:57:38] <%sageternal> russell did u forget to eat breakfast

[2023-01-08 00:57:56] <Applecrystals> maybe we can finally have children with the grim reaper without destroying the game
[2023-01-08 00:57:57] <Cornflake_89> Graveyard in sims 3 is the best. I love the way you can manage the dead
