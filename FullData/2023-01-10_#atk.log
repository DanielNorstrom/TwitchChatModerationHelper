[2023-01-10 11:27:09] <%yunyunku> KEKW
[2023-01-10 11:28:06] <%Eunactes> its going up at an unbelievably fast rate
[2023-01-10 11:28:11] <ShadowDemon_1337> more than korea?
[2023-01-10 11:28:13] <%Eunactes> yesterday it was 4.2k
[2023-01-10 11:28:14] <+lagnumber> Your Robust Interview video motivated me to build on Robust on my soulfist alongside my EO. Spirit bomb is satisfying to look at but hard to master skills being on cooldown
[2023-01-10 11:28:15] <WizemanLAB> it's dead. take a look at steam chart Kappa https://steamcharts.com/app/1599340
[2023-01-10 11:28:16] <%Eunactes> and now its 4.6k?
[2023-01-10 11:28:17] <%yunyunku> RMT is very cheap now, so it makes sense KEKW

[2023-01-10 11:31:29] <ShadowDemon_1337> the prob is no players no servers up
[2023-01-10 11:31:54] <tsunderetemari> atkHey atkHey
[2023-01-10 11:32:04] <Pazam> why are you only doing 2x lopang unas and not 3? @ATK
[2023-01-10 11:32:17] <%yoohyeonisn> he lazy
[2023-01-10 11:32:42] <%yunyunku> i really wish to play raids with mokokos but time doesnt allow me. its kinda problem for me
[2023-01-10 11:33:04] VIEWERS: 163
[2023-01-10 11:33:24] <Pazam> ahh okay, ty
[2023-01-10 11:33:26] <sintiadaria9> i think the rehearsal modes for the raids are really helpful, too bad there are none for valtan and vykas
[2023-01-10 11:33:39] <%+raiichew> oh definitely, not to mention its hard to get through the early game too. A lot of my friends I tried getting the game into quit and barely made it past luterra kek
[2023-01-10 11:33:48] <ShadowDemon_1337> i have 6 and i do in 5
[2023-01-10 11:34:04] <WizemanLAB> chat make sure to submit something for rmt tuesday before he closes the entry.
[2023-01-10 11:34:13] <tsunderetemari> the problem of helping mokoko players is that there are too few players to make consistent lobby
[2023-01-10 11:34:18] <ShadowDemon_1337> hahahaha
[2023-01-10 11:34:28] <%AyeJSuave> Despairge

[2023-01-10 11:35:29] <CookiesOP> i think expecting people to help mokokos out of goodness of their heart is just too much
[2023-01-10 11:35:36] <shadyshirt> if u do gold things for others u will receive the good back SeemsGood

[2023-01-10 11:37:33] <+Traynor123> you should try playing runescape, theres no weekly theres always something to do
[2023-01-10 11:37:33] <sintiadaria9> literally having 1x dailies instead of x2 would make a big difference
[2023-01-10 11:37:55] <%+raiichew> @AyeJSuave do you wait until they have full rest bonus?
[2023-01-10 11:38:11] <+Zarnocs> hey ATK , I have 4 alts for Brelshaza G1-4 , but it is worth it farming G3-4 ?

[2023-01-10 16:31:01] <Ezeelo> 100k for mmo is decent
[2023-01-10 16:31:01] <%Vyse_Hex> most likely
[2023-01-10 16:31:03] <EightSeat> theoretically they are mostly real players

[2023-01-10 16:31:12] <%+jerei__> its high for a mmo
[2023-01-10 16:31:12] <+barbieri89> it it not high
[2023-01-10 16:31:15] <%+deadlypants112> just loook at eso and all them steam charts same
[2023-01-10 16:31:17] <+Hetsu___> tbh 92k on a weekday looks good YEP
[2023-01-10 16:31:17] <+mxsy> it's a decent number
[2023-01-10 16:31:17] <bobdomino> between EU/SA?NA
[2023-01-10 16:31:17] <%Vyse_Hex> 92K is high for MMOs
[2023-01-10 16:31:19] <sepiroth1983> there are still some bots seen in major hubs, so im guessing more on the 80 k mark
[2023-01-10 16:31:19] <+Frots> like 10k are real people
[2023-01-10 16:31:19] <h4zchel> SA prob like 5k KEKW
[2023-01-10 16:31:22] <melik_3> its ait
[2023-01-10 16:31:22] <Amir_0_O_> overall its higher its global time concurrent players
[2023-01-10 16:31:22] <+jeef223> for a game like lost ark its high since people have a ton of alts to continue doing content with eachother
[2023-01-10 16:31:22] <Lundaris> its decent
[2023-01-10 16:31:26] <+GIRORO0> Dude so we was like 60% bots and 40% legit players thats really sad
[2023-01-10 16:31:30] <%+Powerrrrs> chatting yes no
[2023-01-10 16:31:33] <%vegetasaiyanking> No thats a good number imo. I think arnd 100k is great for a MMO
[2023-01-10 16:31:36] <%+deadlypants112> 100k for mmo is good
[2023-01-10 16:31:36] <+pridestalkerino> It's high but if its split into 4 regions its not that high
[2023-01-10 16:31:40] <Ezeelo> 100k concurrent monthly it will be around 3-4mil players
[2023-01-10 16:31:40] <OneLifeOneDestiny> Ку(q)
[2023-01-10 16:31:40] <+elialex_> runescape has like 90k players too

[2023-01-10 16:31:40] <+barbieri89> @h4zchel sad but true
[2023-01-10 16:31:40] <sheikh_joy> Not high considering theres 3 region :p
[2023-01-10 16:31:57] <+Hetsu___> AINTNOWAY
[2023-01-10 16:31:57] <bobdomino> its good but for 3 regions its probably not
[2023-01-10 16:31:57] <ProjectSheeno_o> We have servers to hold 1 million players, we only have 100k, time for NA to have some server merges

[2023-01-10 20:39:23] <DoughBears> so when you choose any move you want to use, you want to check if the pokemon has a higher atk or sp. atk stat.  ideally you would put a physical attack on a high atk pokemon, and special move on a high sp. atk one
