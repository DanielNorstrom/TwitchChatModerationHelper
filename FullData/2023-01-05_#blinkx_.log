[2023-01-05 13:53:21] <%Alasdair> the daft thing about the purge is that it completely overlooks the one crime people would do the most, in favour of murder
[2023-01-05 13:53:21] <Fresh8119> Nicking flowers and giving them to someone you fancy lol

[2023-01-05 15:53:20] <+Fromac40n9> exposure to "bad" things while humans grow up help them become accustomed to the dangers, its like how super religious ppl end up being the biggest sexual deviants

[2023-01-05 15:57:20] <dhNYC> Hi Liz
[2023-01-05 15:57:21] <%Ezpk206> @Fromac40n9 echo chambers for outlandish stuff or far left/right or obscene behavior has never been around to this extent, it was incredible small communities that were shunned by society, but now it is normalized with the ease of access. Do a little research on the topic
[2023-01-05 15:57:22] <+Cwarner312> right answer usually somewhere in the middle
[2023-01-05 15:57:28] <+Fromac40n9> oh social media itself should just be banned in its current state
[2023-01-05 15:57:33] <+Fromac40n9> to all
[2023-01-05 15:57:33] <%maomolinaaa> if a kid doing 3 hours talks more with strangers than her parents
[2023-01-05 15:57:33] <total_acidity> Honestly, there are a lot of adults who shouldn't be allowed on the internet either
[2023-01-05 15:57:35] <%Queza2> I am going for groceries have fun blink
[2023-01-05 15:57:40] <%moisesbed> It‚Äôs not like the church is very safe for kids either‚Ä¶ just saying
[2023-01-05 15:57:41] <wuduyaethink> you guys realize that identifying yourself as leftist/rightest is exactly what the government wants. They want to divide you Kappa
[2023-01-05 15:57:42] <+Cwarner312> hence centrist is right perception to be in
[2023-01-05 15:57:43] <peach_walker> one of one cant take me away from another
[2023-01-05 15:57:43] <LazaruS1697> socializing on social media does not even compares to a real convo., it is a completely different animal
[2023-01-05 15:57:45] <@%$heavymetalrules> drag shows are just the strawman of the week
[2023-01-05 15:57:52] <marbles915> is it unbiased?
[2023-01-05 15:57:52] <phoneofff> Y‚Äôall in here talking about politics? Oh no
[2023-01-05 15:57:54] <+zxeroxhouxr> Corporations take advantage of kids on the internet as a means of income.
