[2023-01-01 12:59:15] <%+XenoMoogle> I just started working for T-Mobile USA, and I will say, their PTO, benefits, and etc are WAY beyond what others offer

[2023-01-01 13:05:23] <%Retaliator_NL> It depends. I don't have a 9-5 mentality. meaning some days I work 9 hours, other days I work 6
[2023-01-01 13:05:37] <%Retaliator_NL> Which is what that means, right? :p
[2023-01-01 13:06:12] <%ooKaballoo> but tehnically, the actual work tends to be 2-3h/day
[2023-01-01 13:06:19] <+Bug_Weasel> my job is shift working 10hr shifts but it's not ON for the full shift so I can manage as i get good sit down periods

[2023-01-01 15:10:25] <+monty_octavarium> I have re-started this game about 3-4 times, never managed to get through it.
[2023-01-01 15:10:43] <%zazu1019> Dry story and not the best of cast of characters
[2023-01-01 15:10:50] <%Retaliator_NL> Ahh. so basically, don't p[lay this game for the story
[2023-01-01 15:11:17] <%TwitchTemplar> Combat is great and thus the endgame activity of hunts is also great

[2023-01-01 15:11:45] <%zazu1019> I mean playing for the story is kind of the point but it's just not a well paced story especially at the start and you're going to be confused through the first play through
[2023-01-01 15:12:16] <+monty_octavarium> Ys8 Lacrimosa of Dana was my favorite last year (though it came out awhile ago)
[2023-01-01 15:12:41] <+Skizz__> @monty_octavarium that game was a surprise hit for me. soooo good

[2023-01-01 15:32:28] <Lonefellow> Part of the reason is that XII has relatively less amount of cutscenes compared to gameplay

[2023-01-01 15:33:22] <%VinalG4ce> do you think they achieved what they needed to convey in this game?

[2023-01-01 15:37:43] <Lonefellow> I don't think Crystal Tools was then used for anything outside of the XIII trilogy

[2023-01-01 15:40:08] <Lonefellow> @TwitchTemplar AFAIK, ARR onwards is a simplified/toned-down Luminous so it can work with an MMO
[2023-01-01 15:40:54] <%+spectr0nn> part of the reason why 13 and 15 took so long to release was because they had to spend so much time on engine tech

[2023-01-01 16:14:09] <%Neobullseye> It's the one thing that I never got about FF13. The core battle system is amazing, but why in the seven heavens do you get a Game Over if the leader dies?
[2023-01-01 16:14:20] <%+wblair> Do you have to rewatch cutscene everytime or can you skip it after game over?

[2023-01-01 16:16:03] <%Neobullseye> @blakey95uk At least in Persona, there are lore reasons for it. In this game, there is no particular difference between the leader and any other character -- doubly so because anyone can be the leader and the leader can be anyone.

[2023-01-01 16:43:22] <skulgun> yall don't like ff7 odin?
[2023-01-01 16:43:27] <%Neobullseye> FF5 Odin is an exception to the rule.
[2023-01-01 16:43:32] <%TidusZecht> FF IX odin is kinda useless
[2023-01-01 16:43:54] <%TwitchTemplar> in 9 you can euip another ability to have it just deal dmg no?
[2023-01-01 16:44:00] <%TidusZecht> FF VIII odin is the bomb
[2023-01-01 16:44:00] <%MasterVGuides> Summons in FF9 are generally useless?
[2023-01-01 16:44:02] <%TidusZecht> never misses

[2023-01-01 16:44:09] <%TidusZecht> but you can't summon him at will
[2023-01-01 16:44:14] <%Neobullseye> Most of the time though, either Odin doesn't work, or whatever it's working on could be oneshotted anyway.
[2023-01-01 16:44:25] <%TidusZecht> yeah, but who uses the Odin Sword ability
[2023-01-01 16:44:38] <%TidusZecht> his damage with that isn't as good
[2023-01-01 16:44:56] <%TidusZecht> FF IV Odin is found in Baron Castle Basement
[2023-01-01 16:44:57] <%AncientGeezer> da duh duh
[2023-01-01 16:45:11] <%Neobullseye> I think it does?
[2023-01-01 16:45:13] <%TidusZecht> FF IV Odin is more and more useful the higher Rydia's magic stat is
[2023-01-01 16:45:15] <%+wblair> Damn Seven you shoulda used your Vanille line there. The l'cie who ruined your life was Vanille
[2023-01-01 16:45:21] <%+imatastypill> I love 13 a whole lot
[2023-01-01 16:45:22] <%TidusZecht> so at high levels he won't ever miss
[2023-01-01 16:45:33] <%TidusZecht> FF IV Odin instakills too

[2023-01-01 16:46:24] <%TidusZecht> so, basically, the highest chance of utilizing Odin on IV is Rydia with Stardust Rod, Tiara, Adamant Armor, and Rune Armlet at a level higher than 50
[2023-01-01 16:46:40] <%$Midnight_Vesper> FFIV Odin does.....things.
[2023-01-01 16:46:47] <%TidusZecht> but level 35 is still tremendous usefulness
[2023-01-01 16:46:47] <%zazu1019> I don't think it's weird since you're normally optimizing your party for more speed or more effective right?
