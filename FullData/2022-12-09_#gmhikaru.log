[2022-12-09 00:01:45] <%+MontyAndo> @TimCannon25 which for me is like 2 buy-ins in 2hours
[2022-12-09 00:01:46] <+YodaCards> I prefer cash to MTTs.  If I'm 2 hours into a cash session and I'm up $1500, I can walk away with my money right then and there instead of having to wait 5 hours for the tourney to end and during that time risk giving up my earned equity.

[2022-12-09 00:07:35] <+YodaCards> Set farming is all about call to pot ratio.  You would have had to commit more than 25% of the pot and so you're not getting the right odds.

[2022-12-09 00:08:03] <jamuraan> Poker isn't always about the cards - It's about HEART
[2022-12-09 00:08:04] <Maartenols> when you double up with 10bb you still do not have much, you are still in the risk zone then  @GMHikaru
[2022-12-09 00:08:05] <+YodaCards> No, 20 is NOT the new 10..  depends on other stack sizes of course.

[2022-12-09 00:13:24] <machinesavage92> 1/2 pot or 3/4 pot is good bet @GMHikaru
[2022-12-09 00:13:26] <%TimCannon25> If u bet too small in that position than you cannot value bet or bluff as well long term, hikaru played it fine
[2022-12-09 00:13:26] <jamuraan> If you only bet 25-30% of the pot, then you are risking less and give them less incentive to bluff, meaning you know they have it more often

[2022-12-09 00:16:25] <+Techranman> no
[2022-12-09 00:16:25] <jamuraan> Betting 3/4 pot on the flop then folding to a re-raise is a HUGE LEAK and if anyone thinks that is a profitable move, you need to rethink poker :)

[2022-12-09 00:29:30] <mjbeazy> @GMHikaru You can click virtual assistant in the bottom right corner.  Then type talk to agent and ask for the password to your 25K guranteed freeroll.  They should give you an updated password.  This happened to another streamer the other day.

[2022-12-09 01:28:48] <+1OutsRUs> it sorta matters if anyone from the table is watching your stream, kinda. like if they know you mucked two hearts and they end up on a heart draw for example.  not a big deal. that's just why they pointed it out probably.

[2022-12-09 02:01:14] <+danandbeard> 50 means you recover more slowly...not that you're weak
[2022-12-09 02:01:17] <%tehceebs> but if you can get scholar's mate, you don't have to box

[2022-12-09 02:17:14] <Maartenols> If you have AA on that flop you also can bet pot, such a small bet is suspicious. Bet pot could look like a bluff  @GMHikaru

[2022-12-09 02:21:27] <+tubslugtv> tight and loose are extremes that you can exploit, ie play loose at this table

[2022-12-09 02:36:03] <+sskinner901> it's too deep for open shoves

[2022-12-09 02:36:09] <MKxJump> cool seeing Hikaru playing Poker
[2022-12-09 02:36:11] <Maartenols> Bet 10.000 you can do preflop and then go all in no mater the flop, you can do @GMHikaru
[2022-12-09 02:36:13] <pranavjoshi7654> you should do it more often hikaru it's a lot of fun
[2022-12-09 02:36:14] <Lancel5891> shoving is correct
[2022-12-09 02:36:14] <swamper101> ACR would probably sponsor you
[2022-12-09 02:36:14] <KoalaWithaNuke> hellooooo
[2022-12-09 02:36:15] <LuckyMagyar> push is fine, best move

[2022-12-09 02:36:37] <thegreatdanton9> Hikaru will make excellent poker player except for his poker face
[2022-12-09 02:36:38] <LuckyMagyar> you dont want to raise/call with A9o really
[2022-12-09 02:36:42] <DrillahSZN> mini raises look stronger than actually shoving at 15 bb
[2022-12-09 02:36:43] <%KenoWC> 15 just 2x from middle position. Button/cutoff/small blind you can shove
[2022-12-09 02:36:43] <hbmsc2> annacSwe annacSwe
[2022-12-09 02:36:43] <+tubslugtv> min raising and limping will get bullied this deep
[2022-12-09 02:36:45] <neevir> gmhmm
[2022-12-09 02:36:46] <%ThinLimmy> shove is fine for 15 there
[2022-12-09 02:36:56] <Lancel5891> You shove there 100%
[2022-12-09 02:36:56] <neevir> have you rmm
[2022-12-09 02:36:58] <+sskinner901> fair point, harder to go wrong with shoving if you're not sure in your skill

[2022-12-09 02:37:18] <leadtub> the online regs playing 630 regularly are miles better better to just not play postflup
[2022-12-09 02:37:20] <Cjarver> @drecandy13 agreed
[2022-12-09 02:37:30] <vcartouche> that song is pushin p
[2022-12-09 02:37:30] <+sskinner901> it used to be that 10 bb was when you started shoving, but now even that is considered too deep
[2022-12-09 02:37:39] <+fretfretfret> MIB

[2022-12-09 02:38:26] <bigdeezyseventhreezy> Love you hikaru but WILL smith is canceled. Mainly cause his music sucks. Haha
[2022-12-09 02:38:32] <neevir> have you ever been so drunk while playing poker you moved your queen card thinking it's chess
[2022-12-09 02:38:34] <lolbit_85> can they see it

[2022-12-09 02:38:47] <jeffbaldwin86> would you ever try chess boxing? even in one of those bouncy rings with sock em boppers?
[2022-12-09 02:38:47] <thegreatdanton9> I believe transitioning from chess to poker is more organic and useful than other way around

[2022-12-09 02:40:30] <%ThinLimmy> fold is right
[2022-12-09 02:40:32] <Maartenols> 45 is a good fold
[2022-12-09 02:40:32] <swamper101> fold
[2022-12-09 02:40:32] <LuckyMagyar> limp with 45o is the best option probably
[2022-12-09 02:40:32] <p3sti1ence> fold is right
[2022-12-09 02:40:33] <sorslasauce> never shove that
[2022-12-09 02:40:33] <+sskinner901> folding is right
[2022-12-09 02:40:36] <+skreap111> fold is fine there.
[2022-12-09 02:40:41] <GaryTTV> shove 4/6 os?
[2022-12-09 02:40:44] <%ThinLimmy> 5 high is a goof fold
[2022-12-09 02:40:46] <%LeftysLife> 10,8s can shove
[2022-12-09 02:40:49] <exDeeLessThanThree> min raise and put the choice on him

[2022-12-09 02:41:03] <Maartenols> Never limp now, raise or all i  @GMHikaru
[2022-12-09 02:41:04] <%LeftysLife> 17bbs is a lot
[2022-12-09 02:41:10] <+skreap111> shove with any ax any kx most qx most jx, suited connectors and pocket pairs
[2022-12-09 02:41:12] VIEWERS: 1¬†664
[2022-12-09 02:41:14] <LuckyMagyar> because your image is tight they wont attack your limp very often, so limp is fine imo
[2022-12-09 02:41:14] <sorslasauce> not blind bounty my bad
[2022-12-09 02:41:15] <milfton19> why shove? u need to trap with limps
[2022-12-09 02:41:19] <lolbit_85> mkxTrevor mkxTrevorW
[2022-12-09 02:41:21] <Maartenols> 45 was a good fold, imo
[2022-12-09 02:41:23] <Cjarver> When I played many years ago the guideline was that ~10bb is where the wacky shoves come in. But you‚Äôre right blind vs blind has a very loose range
[2022-12-09 02:41:26] <%KenoWC> You limp about 50% range sb off 17
[2022-12-09 02:41:32] <thenakedsingularity> A10 and above shove
[2022-12-09 02:41:34] <68W10> is this with real money??
[2022-12-09 02:41:35] <leoduhlion11> how's Ohio?

[2022-12-09 02:56:03] <+thusstle> @sharkmolty just give it a rest
[2022-12-09 02:56:07] <%KenoWC> You should check out BBZ, good training/coaching

[2022-12-09 02:56:15] <+fretfretfret> @good_ol_tesch seems like more when I am watching him, 8 minutes.
[2022-12-09 02:56:20] <%sofasuit> getting poker advice from hikaru would be as bad as his chess advice. cmon. he's a streamer
[2022-12-09 02:56:21] <sharkmolty> I‚Äôd rather see your cards and wait 5 mins for you to respond to chat then look at a fish lmao

[2022-12-09 02:58:10] <libin_> I agree with shark lol its kinda pointless to watch if we cant see his cards. Its a shame bc it would be cool to watch a gm chess player play and share his thoughts on his current hand
[2022-12-09 02:58:36] <thegreatdanton9> i always doubted about legitimacy of acr but seeing hikaru play I have no doubts henceforth

[2022-12-09 02:58:47] <%+wiskirz> It's a live game for cash
[2022-12-09 02:58:53] <%wv223> @libin_ it def would be hugely more entertaining, but still good even without it
[2022-12-09 02:58:56] <cptevanss> if you pay attention its not pointless, sure he will share his cards after he won/lost a hand
[2022-12-09 02:59:01] <SKETHUG> How many people started in the tournament chat??
[2022-12-09 02:59:13] <ExtraterrestrialWizard> @wiskirz that was given to him by the house

[2022-12-09 03:00:10] <%+leetgeek> thanks for the great content
[2022-12-09 03:00:14] <cptevanss> do you care about payout implications or just winning the tournament?
[2022-12-09 03:00:14] <%DreCandy13> i think most of this chat would prefer the cards covered versus a delay with how often he reads chat
[2022-12-09 03:00:15] <boredchessbots> Hikaru, are you tuning in to the chess boxing match?
[2022-12-09 03:00:23] <twitchdeilt> is this real money or fake?
[2022-12-09 03:00:26] <@%+Creamsicle> @cptevanss he'd like to cash haha
[2022-12-09 03:00:30] <thegreatdanton9> Missed opportunity to not stream with hole cards on with a lag

[2022-12-09 03:00:43] <thegreatdanton9> I wanted to hear how you think about poker hands
[2022-12-09 03:00:44] <+sskinner901> Not sure why everyone is acting like Hikaru is about to blind out.  It sucks when your stack is 1/3 of average, but that doesn't mean you should be open-shoving
[2022-12-09 03:00:53] <%wv223> @DreCandy13 not actually sure if i agree with that
[2022-12-09 03:00:57] <aymaneeth> do you plan to chess box someday hiki
[2022-12-09 03:00:58] <twitchdeilt> so what does 16.89BB mean
[2022-12-09 03:01:00] <sharkmolty> @libin_ that‚Äôs how I feel lol. I‚Äôm not mad, but like the guy above said, in terms of gameplay you‚Äôre getting nothing. I‚Äôd rather watch a delay and him explain hands then answer random chat questions
[2022-12-09 03:01:09] <xilft> is it sub money ha ü§î

[2022-12-09 03:01:39] <ShuckMorris> did u take a bong rip on break?

[2022-12-09 03:01:50] <+sskinner901> It's super old school to open-shove 15 bb, it's at least 10 years out of date
[2022-12-09 03:01:58] <paradoxicql> ...
[2022-12-09 03:01:59] <prom2tu> @maartenols stop giving bad advice being adamant you're the best.
[2022-12-09 03:02:02] <sharkmolty> @drecandy13 I don‚Äôt think most chat prefers cards covered
[2022-12-09 03:02:04] <thegreatdanton9> These are all right answers. Depends on how you construct your strategy and how complex you can get with it
[2022-12-09 03:02:05] <cptevanss> its getting closer to fold or shove territory
[2022-12-09 03:02:09] <cptevanss> but not yet
