[2022-12-26 15:52:14] <S4nG0> Yeah that's weird
[2022-12-26 15:52:15] <+Raiyvin> how does water cause splosions?
[2022-12-26 15:52:16] <!%+yrvengalied> and i dont know how to surf
[2022-12-26 15:52:18] <%AlexiusY> it looks cool
[2022-12-26 15:52:26] <%+Smashtro> sim was having a nap and the singing pissed him off

[2022-12-26 15:52:55] <+Dayriu> not now, guru!
[2022-12-26 15:53:02] <%MsCrixii> Was that the Party Pooper song?
[2022-12-26 15:53:10] <+ShikaShogi> Don’t suppose he fired the same number as there are summons/temples did he?
[2022-12-26 15:53:29] <+ShikaShogi> Never thought about it much myself but might make sense ^^
[2022-12-26 15:53:29] <%Onnings> I always thought that was the dark aeons

[2022-12-26 15:54:02] <skulgun> I guess no big deal having 3 chars if you can jump wherever you want in the sphere grid
[2022-12-26 15:55:16] <%quovad15> if you can hit 9999 you are fine
[2022-12-26 15:55:36] <+Dayriu> the hard part is getting to the point of power up
[2022-12-26 15:55:42] <dapbowler> At this point of the game, you don’t care about brining in the other party for exp during the fight?0

[2022-12-26 15:55:46] <+Matequillo> nice 53 from wakka
[2022-12-26 15:55:48] <skulgun> I do like yuna taking her place as the actual protagonist tho
[2022-12-26 15:55:50] <%IcyJimmyJam> Mid game was where some of the challenges really hit hard, the planning and force parties aren't easy
[2022-12-26 15:56:10] <%MsCrixii> The worst part of this challenge is not being able to consistently level up everyone
[2022-12-26 15:56:13] <%Onnings> Its easy to become a super-ripped Arnold Swartznegger. Its the path there that's a pain in the dick.
[2022-12-26 15:56:35] <%quovad15> its funny that you can be so overpowered in this game, but for the main story its not needed at all.
[2022-12-26 15:57:42] <%quovad15> yes but like you said, compare it to other FFs the grind is minimal.
[2022-12-26 15:57:45] VIEWERS: 660
[2022-12-26 15:57:56] <%Yurizo007> I did dark aeons n stuff before finishing the game and did the last bosses in 2 hits. I was disappointed lol. I was also young. these days I do story first before the superbosses XD
[2022-12-26 15:58:01] <+Raiyvin> jparaWelp
[2022-12-26 15:58:25] <%quovad15> @Yurizo007 same, and that is what i mean with that

[2022-12-26 16:56:19] <$TheDarkArgo> I thought this was funny: The other day I found a couple of Rares in the Legion expansion of WoW and they spawn together, so two rares (two being two ponies) and one looks like it has ice magic around the legs while the other has fire. WoW wouldn't let me name them to Blizzaga and Firaga for Mature Language. LUL
