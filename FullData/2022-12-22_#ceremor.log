[2022-12-22 08:02:19] <YarrM8> maybe it's the sharpness of the graphics in this games that makes it more obvious than the other streams idk

[2022-12-22 10:01:48] <kriegfleisch> he was doing that solo, now they are even more likely to run. LuL
[2022-12-22 10:02:20] <cougne> i just started this game as a solo mage,  fucking nightmare

[2022-12-22 10:03:23] <Amuze586> How is it being solo? Just a complete disadvantage?
[2022-12-22 10:03:44] <Amuze586> Or is there some sorta matchmaking that tries to pair you with other solos.
[2022-12-22 10:03:46] <kriegfleisch> seems like it's dependant on your map knowledge and the class you play
[2022-12-22 10:03:59] <kriegfleisch> oh in matchmaking
[2022-12-22 10:04:07] <Amuze586> sheesh
[2022-12-22 10:04:09] <kriegfleisch> doesn't seem like there's a system for it, just

[2022-12-22 10:05:01] <cougne> @Amuze586  complete disadvantage, you cant do shit to escape / fight (as a mage at least)
[2022-12-22 10:05:51] <Amuze586> @cougne Probably only option is rogue/ranger to try one shot before they even know you're there.
[2022-12-22 10:05:53] <kriegfleisch> watching ceremor play rogue, he's been doing well against groups
[2022-12-22 10:06:15] <munchiwack> mage is actually good at escaping, haste+invis
[2022-12-22 10:06:18] <kriegfleisch> taking advantage of darkness and people being completely unaware

[2022-12-22 10:06:49] <YetAnotherVoidling> mages have haste and invis, they can be super rogue-like
[2022-12-22 10:07:46] <cougne> yes, still have to learn map/spell etc, as a first character , its a little bit painfull

[2022-12-22 11:12:23] <kriegfleisch> because your agility changed when equipping items too

[2022-12-22 11:17:21] <kriegfleisch> i have seen people block attacks with shields, so i am guessing you can block arrows too, so long as you're blocking in the direction they shoot from

[2022-12-22 11:28:58] <kriegfleisch> does the dagger poison count as a debuff?
[2022-12-22 11:29:08] <Swoople__> using that dagger and the other rogue attack that does a single time 50% damage buff and hitting with the third hit of it from behind and headshoting is such a silly amount of burst
[2022-12-22 11:29:10] <Mikey904> I was watching my buddy on Discord when it happened. He has an old shitty PC that barely runs DayZ. I never setup his clipping hotkeys because he has AMD GPU and Idk where those settings are xD
[2022-12-22 11:29:28] <kriegfleisch> because if it does, you could pull off some really stupid debuff duration increases

[2022-12-22 11:38:28] <Marcus_Helius> A good barb rebalance would be adding a slow or stun to their roar that affects players

[2022-12-22 12:36:14] <%+Solsh> got to switch to wizard
[2022-12-22 12:36:22] <%+Solsh> play the best class
[2022-12-22 12:36:30] <munchiwack> its less dmg than the bleed unless you got a crazy weap but the -50% defense debuff is real nice
[2022-12-22 12:36:32] <%BlueBengal93> ceremoNade
[2022-12-22 12:36:54] <+classicx> rupture is nice with throwing knives
[2022-12-22 12:37:06] <%BlueBengal93> Wizard rope-a-dope is the best tactic I've seen. Go invis, kite players into skele spawns, then finish with Magic Pissile
[2022-12-22 12:37:16] <%+Solsh> sneak around and shoot orbs üßô
[2022-12-22 12:37:18] <+Yocstar> hi @Ceremor did you used to play DayZ

[2022-12-22 12:37:31] <%BlueBengal93> @Yocstar Retired streamer
[2022-12-22 12:37:35] <%+bhudge_> Yeah he used to
[2022-12-22 12:38:35] <%+Solsh> when is the dwarf fortress stream
[2022-12-22 12:38:38] <%dabombzey> he never plays dayz dont trust him, and even when he does its a short 30-40hours stream
[2022-12-22 12:39:19] VIEWERS: 435
[2022-12-22 12:39:54] <kriegfleisch> my guess would be it just adds physical damage to an already existing physical weapon
[2022-12-22 12:40:01] <kriegfleisch> will increases buff duration
[2022-12-22 12:41:16] <%KOSNPC> I cant find out how to rotate items, is it even possible?

[2022-12-22 12:48:21] <GEEO> probably can sell that for 300g or so
[2022-12-22 12:48:22] <DevAlmighty> I didn't have a chance to play it yet. But I really looking forward to it.
[2022-12-22 12:48:32] <bizlekleze> per the official discord
[2022-12-22 12:48:37] <lovetapr> apparently until the 26th
[2022-12-22 12:48:43] <munchiwack> @DevAlmighty theyve been doing 1 weekend a month though before this so probably end of january after this

[2022-12-22 13:22:43] <kriegfleisch> fireball has 5
[2022-12-22 13:23:28] <neon__lite> a wizard could have 6 bolts 5 fireballs 5 missles and 6 ice blasts if they wanted
[2022-12-22 13:23:32] <kriegfleisch> fireball base is 5, idk if there's items that change it?
[2022-12-22 13:23:36] VIEWERS: 441
[2022-12-22 13:24:38] <kriegfleisch> they can buff their fireball to make you do 10% less physical damage and burn you for 2.5 seconds longer than base though
[2022-12-22 13:25:29] <neon__lite> ya and invis too. Q resets some spells and thats on cooldown so they could keep getting them back
[2022-12-22 13:25:31] <YetAnotherVoidling> yeah all of them
[2022-12-22 13:25:35] <neon__lite> thats the amount at the start ya
[2022-12-22 13:25:38] VIEWERS: 441
[2022-12-22 13:25:41] <kriegfleisch> tiers go from 1-4 and there is also a tier 6, which is chain lightning
[2022-12-22 13:25:53] <kriegfleisch> the tier of spell is the amount of points it costs to "learn" from the looks of it
[2022-12-22 13:26:14] <neon__lite> you can bait out spells but yeah that can have a bunch over time and campfires resets spells too
[2022-12-22 13:26:20] <kriegfleisch> they have a ton of utility too which is cool
[2022-12-22 13:26:44] <kriegfleisch> they can apply a 40% slow for 2.5 seconds
[2022-12-22 13:27:00] <+classicx> usually at most they will have 15 attack spells or so
[2022-12-22 13:27:26] <kriegfleisch> they also do have an invis spell, but it only lasts 4 seconds, it does make you 10% faster though

[2022-12-22 14:03:57] <%Clyde904> do you ever wonder if youll play one of these games and itll just stick with you
[2022-12-22 14:04:02] <%+im0tept> ill war in 4 hours if war is to be had
[2022-12-22 14:04:49] <kriegfleisch> fighters should be able to beat you when you come out of invis, i think just none of them run the things that would counter you bursting them
[2022-12-22 14:04:58] <@fruitkek> have you bumped into the chad 1 shot wizards yet
[2022-12-22 14:05:00] <%DefinitelyNotCristina> Got it. Thank you

[2022-12-22 14:07:07] <stashanz> Can you insure stuff?
[2022-12-22 14:07:20] <stashanz> Rip lol
[2022-12-22 14:07:32] <%DefinitelyNotCristina> @nksharp well...yeah LUL
[2022-12-22 14:07:43] <kriegfleisch> seems kinda pointless for insurance, game is too fast and you regear too quickly to have gear fear
[2022-12-22 14:07:52] <%nKSharp> If you dont suck at tarkov you can have a lot of meds/gear preloaded Kappa

[2022-12-22 14:08:19] <kriegfleisch> but who knows, maybe that changes the longer the game is in development
[2022-12-22 14:08:44] <kriegfleisch> oooo that guy has the 5 arrow shot ability
[2022-12-22 14:08:49] <$bangpowpoopoo> this would be a good game for prediction gambling
