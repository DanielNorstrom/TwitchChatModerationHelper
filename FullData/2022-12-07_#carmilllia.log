[2022-12-07 11:45:42] <%neoquegon> oh it still says just chatting in the title
[2022-12-07 11:45:48] <%MR_Reality_Villain> Think of Get Stuffed as DBD, but with the option to fight back against the killer, and other sub roles that can either help survivor or end everyone. Think you can play up to 10+ players
[2022-12-07 11:46:33] <%BasedGingie> theres also that dbd prophunt game
