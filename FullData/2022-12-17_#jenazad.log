[2022-12-17 02:42:54] <%+parode_> @jenazad I broke it bc I got 3 frames of light and Giselle in 65 pulls‚Ä¶
[2022-12-17 02:42:57] <%Ramsir> "I don't remember" is code for "I totally remember but I just realized it was a very inappropriate dream", right? SUSSY
[2022-12-17 02:42:57] <skysailor_> @beanflakes even at dreams vtubers aren't real huh

[2022-12-17 02:44:21] <JoeK5> Has anyone found a build for Giselle or is she "Earth Roy" at this point?
[2022-12-17 02:44:34] <@%ProfessorBloak> that's my boi PepeLaugh
[2022-12-17 02:44:45] <coolbrycester> Feels bad we lost gw 14080-14200

[2022-12-17 02:44:52] <coolbrycester> We‚Äôre still rank 1 for now tho
[2022-12-17 02:44:54] <Beanflakes> she just needs a bit of s3 damage tweaking ok
[2022-12-17 02:44:57] <JoeK5> I got two pieces of 70 gear... but don't know who to use it on.
[2022-12-17 02:45:00] <%silent_dove> it was funny bc light was complaining that defense was boring KEKW

[2022-12-17 02:45:04] <JoeK5> 70 gear score that is
[2022-12-17 02:45:12] <Beanflakes> or like an s3 soulburn that gives it more damage for 20 souls ok
[2022-12-17 02:45:24] <%KTAKyle> what the heck, i went to bed and you were streaming, i get home from work and your streaming.
[2022-12-17 02:45:27] <%silent_dove> professors with the lua choux senya

[2022-12-17 02:45:36] <+Danzras> when is the content battle?
[2022-12-17 02:45:37] <%+parode_> Elve had a lot more wins with her today but it‚Äôs just a elvemage59 diff lol @jenazad
[2022-12-17 02:45:41] <Waaghbafet> Thats why i dislike straight up huge damage dealers. How do you balance them? How do you balance Giselle? if they increase her damage then she just straight up deletes 2 unit right off the bat.
[2022-12-17 02:45:57] <@%ProfessorBloak> Feels bad I had to get rid of the Rem defense because I needed her counter gear Sadge
[2022-12-17 02:46:07] <%+parode_> Yeah she still sucks
[2022-12-17 02:46:17] <skysailor_> @professorbloak ungearing Rem WTFF
[2022-12-17 02:46:18] <%+parode_> If he has that much of a challenge it‚Äôs not lookin good
[2022-12-17 02:46:19] <+breastedduck> @ProfessorBloak sadge, that def carried us. who did you put it on
[2022-12-17 02:46:23] <%Ramsir> I'mma be honest, I couldn't really see Giselle being any better than Luna since the reveal
[2022-12-17 02:46:39] <JoeK5> I wish I could use Fribbles... but none of my emulators are working anymore.
[2022-12-17 02:46:52] <%+parode_> The thing is she has the potential I think there is just no enabler for her yet
[2022-12-17 02:46:54] <@%ProfessorBloak> @breastedduck it got dispersed so I dont remember PepeLaugh but the sword went to yulha because it had like 41% hp substat
[2022-12-17 02:46:57] <radioactive_goop> the video lied NOWAY

[2022-12-17 02:47:27] <%+parode_> Atleast she isn‚Äôt like arunka and is just dogshit no matter what you do :)
[2022-12-17 02:47:29] <%vyzzu> hunt buff maybe tomorrow??
[2022-12-17 02:47:37] <skysailor_> UrTrippin
[2022-12-17 02:47:52] <@%ProfessorBloak> @breastedduck i think this new defense is not too bad tho! still getting green shields and last gw I got a ton of green shields too so we still out here with it ok
[2022-12-17 02:48:00] <%Ramsir> at least Giselle gave us the UrTrippin meme
[2022-12-17 02:48:08] <Basic_AFF> Man jena UrTrippin she's so good Clueless
[2022-12-17 02:48:10] <%Sotplugs> Hii Jena, your match is tomorrow? Gd luck!
[2022-12-17 02:48:20] <@%ProfessorBloak> @skysailor_ Sadge
[2022-12-17 02:48:24] <pedr_twitch> UrTrippin
[2022-12-17 02:48:36] <%Ramsir> UrTrippin if you think Giselle isn't top tier
[2022-12-17 02:48:43] <Beanflakes> UrTrippin you can see her nipple in the s3
[2022-12-17 02:48:48] <+Kontossis> not even elve could make giselle work PainPeko

[2022-12-17 03:02:09] <+froliz> one direction i saw for her build is build as anti cleave since she's a knight and she cuts with 50%

[2022-12-17 03:02:48] <hyoribo_m3lly> skystones always
[2022-12-17 03:02:52] <lchang1983> I mean RTA is harder than arena.

[2022-12-17 03:03:18] <frostfirefox_> @mehboizz lqc but no preview yet
[2022-12-17 03:03:19] <eljackoloco> like skystone or mystic

[2022-12-17 03:04:13] <hyoribo_m3lly> skystones over mystics because the mystics are way too little. if you do shop refresh with the skystones u can get more mystics from that

[2022-12-17 03:06:02] <+PonchoPyromaniac> WTFF
[2022-12-17 03:06:05] <+crackgyver> problem is that there is no Teleporters !
[2022-12-17 03:06:05] <%+El3m3nT120> it' fuckin trash
[2022-12-17 03:06:06] <Seanroni> i think it's overkill that you have to use different units
[2022-12-17 03:06:08] <JoeK5> Without taking the gear off those units, is this a decent start for Sage or up the eff res more? - https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/788648577857486848/1053492489241239552/Epic_Seven_2022-12-16-20-59-27.jpg
[2022-12-17 03:06:09] <Seanroni> that's the biggest problem
[2022-12-17 03:06:11] <%+El3m3nT120> only ppl in super latye game can do it
[2022-12-17 03:06:15] <smalik05> I think nightmare lab is ok since it‚Äôs only once a month
[2022-12-17 03:06:15] <%+El3m3nT120> it makes no sense
[2022-12-17 03:06:18] <mehboizz> tbh i need to build new units to do nightmare
[2022-12-17 03:06:20] <Seanroni> no seriously biggest problem is having to use new units
[2022-12-17 03:06:21] <+crackgyver> why no Teleporters!?
[2022-12-17 03:06:24] <Seanroni> really really dumb lol
[2022-12-17 03:06:26] <%silent_dove> walk of shame when you die
[2022-12-17 03:06:32] <%+kevingg141> if unequip was free nightmare wouldnt be so annoying
[2022-12-17 03:06:33] <a3rin> should i even bother do nightmare labs? i just want the pen neck on the shop @Jenazad  NONONONONO
[2022-12-17 03:06:42] <%Chandler_ICantFitTheRest1> hi
[2022-12-17 03:06:47] <%hunterbiscuit> by the way jena could you link the musics you use for showcase videos ?
[2022-12-17 03:06:50] <benderloin> you snooze you lose

[2022-12-17 03:07:17] <a3rin> ok i can try that
[2022-12-17 03:07:23] <ChubbyBunny27> like i float in emperor so my gear quality is solid, but having to regear pve units with my pvp gear is just absolutely asinine to do once a month
[2022-12-17 03:07:28] <%+Liharaa> oh i thought tourney matches now o,o
[2022-12-17 03:07:30] <a3rin> i also think about doin some nightmare then dump all on normal
[2022-12-17 03:07:33] <!Aizvern> I do regular cause I can't nightmare yet unfortunately

[2022-12-17 04:10:04] <Treebrot> !yulha
[2022-12-17 04:10:04] <^Nightbot> Yulha is currently popular because 1: She has a 100% provoke on her S1 (krau does not) 2: her S2 lets her full cleanse + gives herself a barrier AND cr push, which essentially guarantees she gets her S3 off at low hp (krau is worthless vs debuffs) 3: her S3 ignores all damage share (including arrowell's escort) + heals her if it kills. She is a solid answer to currently popular units like Lhc, adin, riolet, etc due to how easy it is for her to kill them with her S3

[2022-12-17 04:44:00] <^Nightbot> Yulha is currently popular because 1: She has a 100% provoke on her S1 (krau does not) 2: her S2 lets her full cleanse + gives herself a barrier AND cr push, which essentially guarantees she gets her S3 off at low hp (krau is worthless vs debuffs) 3: her S3 ignores all damage share (including arrowell's escort) + heals her if it kills. She is a solid answer to currently popular units like Lhc, adin, riolet, etc due to how easy it is for her to kill them with her S3

Little did she know I am excited to get the honor to even get close to her spectacular feet. Would I not only kiss her feet but I would personally clean each of her toes by sucking on each one until she is satisfied with the result. I can imagine the smell of roses from her feet as I lick in between her toenails.

[2022-12-17 06:16:06] <^Nightbot> Yulha is currently popular because 1: She has a 100% provoke on her S1 (krau does not) 2: her S2 lets her full cleanse + gives herself a barrier AND cr push, which essentially guarantees she gets her S3 off at low hp (krau is worthless vs debuffs) 3: her S3 ignores all damage share (including arrowell's escort) + heals her if it kills. She is a solid answer to currently popular units like Lhc, adin, riolet, etc due to how easy it is for her to kill them with her S3

[2022-12-17 06:26:39] <meowmutu_> !yulha
[2022-12-17 06:26:40] <^Nightbot> Yulha is currently popular because 1: She has a 100% provoke on her S1 (krau does not) 2: her S2 lets her full cleanse + gives herself a barrier AND cr push, which essentially guarantees she gets her S3 off at low hp (krau is worthless vs debuffs) 3: her S3 ignores all damage share (including arrowell's escort) + heals her if it kills. She is a solid answer to currently popular units like Lhc, adin, riolet, etc due to how easy it is for her to kill them with her S3

[2022-12-17 06:35:46] <^Nightbot> Yulha is currently popular because 1: She has a 100% provoke on her S1 (krau does not) 2: her S2 lets her full cleanse + gives herself a barrier AND cr push, which essentially guarantees she gets her S3 off at low hp (krau is worthless vs debuffs) 3: her S3 ignores all damage share (including arrowell's escort) + heals her if it kills. She is a solid answer to currently popular units like Lhc, adin, riolet, etc due to how easy it is for her to kill them with her S3

[2022-12-17 08:17:28] <Shirousa> Some people think that ML Celine should have 100% nimble strike when she has her buff. Are they tripping for thinking that'd be a good idea? or am i overestimating it

[2022-12-17 09:05:36] <^Nightbot> Specter Tenebria is at the top of every list I see and she completely deserves it. The dark tyrant that requests us lower level humans to kiss her feet. Little did she know I am excited to get the honor to even get close to her spectacular feet. Would I not only kiss her feet but I would personally clean each of her toes by sucking on each one until she is satisfied with the result. I can imagine the smell of roses from her feet as I lick in between her toenails.

[2022-12-17 09:27:21] <Shirousa> it's honestly insulting. "We're going to work towards releasing more balaced units" immediately releases hwayoung. "We're gonna nerf hwayoung because she's too overbearing and limits the design of future releases" -> immediately releases lua
