[2023-01-06 01:24:32] <@^Nightbot> ‚ÄúYour aim is insane.‚Äù Kyedae said, as she slipped her feminine hand into TenZ‚Äôs pants and smirked. ‚ÄúAre you trying to spray me?‚Äù protests TenZ, as Kyedae blushes, the boyish figure undressed before Kyedae. ‚ÄúWeak ass eco play, Kyedae.‚Äù The two kissed, deeply and passionately, and afterwards TenZ dropped his Sova arrow into Kyedae‚Äôs open bombsite.'

NA‚Äôs last hope, and the most wild entry in VALORANT. He‚Äôs not just a mere man, he‚Äôs a myth, a legend, a god. That is PROD.

[2023-01-06 12:53:04] <goop_goop__> !ping
[2023-01-06 12:53:05] <@^Nightbot> Ping (Packet Internet Groper) is a method for determining communication latency between two networks. Simply put, ping is a method of determining latency or the amount of time it takes for data to travel between two devices or across a network. As communication latency decreases, communication effectiveness improves. A low ping time is critical in situations where the timely delivery of data is more important than the quantity and quality of the desired information.

[2023-01-06 12:53:40] <%bluelishi> we had 4-8 on defense, team is mental booming after 2 rounds, I try to keep team mental up, we go on attack and win 7 rounds, we go 11-10. Our pehnoix solo pushes in and tilts because no one trades him but we didn't know what he was doing, and decides he's gonna troll the game, people mental boom all over again and we lose 13-11. I'm so...annoyed. Why play ranked if your mental is so fucking goddamn shit

[2023-01-06 17:14:40] <@^Nightbot> Who is prod? He is the nightmare dream of all radiants. His demonic gameplay has no rhyme or reason. He will waste abilities and still get a 4k. He may bottom frag almost every game, but he does it with style. If you kill him, your stream sniping. If you die to him, your a bot. Don‚Äôt line up for him, because he WILL whiff. NA‚Äôs last hope, and the most wild entry in VALORANT. He‚Äôs not just a mere man, he‚Äôs a myth, a legend, a god. That is PROD.

Don‚Äôt you want top 10? Why are you throwing for your team with those atrocities of what you call skins. You need to step up and be a better man. Change your skins. Grow. Evolve. Be better.
