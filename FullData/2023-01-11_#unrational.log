[2023-01-11 01:18:08] <%$hm0t> But sleeping in a cold room helps you sleep as your core body temperature drops which helps to switch off, if the room is to hot your brains works harder to shut down

[2023-01-11 02:02:56] <%that_pat_guy> it had to have been a visual glitch cause the crown was way outa zone when they armed the bomb
