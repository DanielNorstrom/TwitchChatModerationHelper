[2022-12-07 12:48:51] <Nickvourl> boomkin needs a while to ramp up dmg as usual
[2022-12-07 12:48:58] <Nickvourl> in high keys it will be GG
[2022-12-07 12:48:58] <%+Kl1ck> maybe not in the first tier bur i think in coming seasons it will be better with scaling

[2022-12-07 13:16:45] <%Stricken79> @Byrni you should get max ilvl before doing wq and t hings that items scale off ilvl

[2022-12-07 14:44:59] <+sumthinclevr> @UrNtPrepared Right? The most useful tip I've ever received for travelling is to roll pants, socks, shirts, etc instead of folding them.  Not to put them inside of a bag and then into a suitcase.

[2022-12-07 15:25:18] <%TaeKwonJerry> Like with some old world stuff, if you unlearned a profession, you kept the skill when you went back to it or something.  You'd have to buy back all the recipes.

[2022-12-07 15:40:37] <+yarndyttv> the highways change speed limits by timing cars and traffic
[2022-12-07 15:40:42] <%Sebleh> When I first started driving like 15 years ago I always feared that the toll roads would do that since the ticket has a print time and you give it to someone.

[2022-12-07 15:42:05] <%Sebleh> Well now in Florida they’ve started automating everything. They charge you to your car’s plates or a device you buy that’s linked to your car. Kinda nuts. Still shocked they haven’t tied it to time traveled for tickets PepeLaugh

[2022-12-07 15:45:39] <%Sebleh> @tiny_moona SunPass is expensive only because the tolls are expensive. I checked the signs on the side of the turnpike recently and it’s literally like 60% of the toll by plate price.

[2022-12-07 16:00:07] <bluushie> @Anelit21 No, there are state representative lawyers
[2022-12-07 16:00:17] <+Skylli> if lawyer are gov employee then it has flood as well cuz they would work for government and such they would have interest when someone sue the government/city/public stuff
[2022-12-07 16:00:17] <Anelit21> @bluushie oh really
[2022-12-07 16:00:30] <Anelit21> @bluushie interesting
[2022-12-07 16:01:24] <bluushie> @Anelit21 This is why in movies etc when you are interrogated they always say "you have the right for legal representation and if you do not have a lawyer the state will provide one"

[2022-12-07 17:39:19] <%+scurrywc> I dont get that, how do you craft a 382 cloak without spark?
[2022-12-07 17:39:29] <%+scurrywc> Matrix + what
[2022-12-07 17:39:45] <%polygoncoke> Yeah you still wanna do all the m0’s for Matrices even if you get no gear upgrades, right?
[2022-12-07 17:39:46] <%AceReformed> @scurrywc matrix allows you to craft 392 max ilvl pieces
[2022-12-07 17:39:47] <khyzoleum> 382 is the absolutely highest ilvl for a rank 5 blue base item with the M0 titan training matrix (Titan Training Matrix IV)

[2022-12-07 17:40:08] <bogstark> @scurrywc i think you can craft a non spark item with an epic matrix and it makes it 382. i could be wrong tho
[2022-12-07 17:40:28] <%onegunpete> How's Nagony doing?
[2022-12-07 17:40:35] <khyzoleum> Sparks are used for the epic base items, which are around 382 at the low ranks
[2022-12-07 17:40:52] <%+scurrywc> I guess what im confused about is what crafting order do i palce
[2022-12-07 17:41:02] <%+scurrywc> a blue item and provide titan?
[2022-12-07 17:41:18] <%+Kildrakk> Don't forget the cloak from the Wrathion rep grind is probably better than the crafted
[2022-12-07 17:41:35] <khyzoleum> @scurrywc Yes. Blue base items can use Titan Training Matrices as optional reagents to empower them. Epic base items require a spark as a required ingredient and can use the raid-quality upgrade items (not available yet) as optional reagents to go even higher.
[2022-12-07 17:41:45] <+knokout64> Yes @scurrywc there's a slot in the work order UI for a matrix, but it's not guaranteed 382 it depends on the crafter
[2022-12-07 17:41:51] <%+scurrywc> Got it, thanks so much guys
[2022-12-07 17:42:07] <%Sebleh> I guess the question is how many ilvls is the socket worth on a ring
[2022-12-07 17:42:12] <%polygoncoke> Has anyone seen their WQ rewards scale to more than 379?
[2022-12-07 17:42:47] <kuromebro> socket is worth 7 ilvl
[2022-12-07 17:42:57] <%Limdaer> Just buy the 366 cloak from pvp vendor

[2022-12-07 17:51:05] <@%Kuroz> seblehNotes  deez nuts
[2022-12-07 17:51:54] <khyzoleum> @IVIAZE Infuse with power is an optional reagent to raise its ilvls even higher. For an epic item like this, it is the raid-level items that are not available yet
[2022-12-07 17:51:56] <%KingBliznakov> and when u put gems with primary stat + best scondary is big
[2022-12-07 17:53:31] <+KnotlessKnot> NOTED
[2022-12-07 17:53:33] <bogstark> non spark items can go up to 382 with the epic thing right?
[2022-12-07 17:53:55] <khyzoleum> Yeah 382 is rank 5 blue items with Titan Training Matrix IV
[2022-12-07 17:54:02] <bogstark> awesome thanks!
[2022-12-07 17:54:09] <radicaL3i> oh no chat she's about to waste her spark
[2022-12-07 17:54:30] <bogstark> i waisted my spark yesterday on the leather chest that procs vers for everyone
[2022-12-07 17:54:37] <@%JohnnyOneLung> ... no
[2022-12-07 17:54:49] <@%JohnnyOneLung> for very unrelated reasons you don't need to answer that question
[2022-12-07 17:54:49] <khyzoleum> I think that it procs on main stat gems, but it gives the associated secondary stat. Like the primary stat + haste gem is a Ysemerald, which is an Air gem, so it counts as an "air empowerment" and gives haste.
