[2022-12-27 08:48:49] <@%^Nightbot> UselessFact: Studies show that if a cat falls off the seventh floor of a building it has about thirty percent less chance of surviving than a cat that falls off the twentieth floor. It supposedly takes about eight floors for the cat to realize what is occurring, relax and correct itself.

[2022-12-27 10:17:10] <mightalius> @mthrfckermerg if you're around people who brag about money and you feel bad about it, that's not them being hurtful, that's one's own insecurities at play.

[2022-12-27 10:18:22] <%+bruceleroy1111> bit odd to brag about money, brag about time you have to do what you want if youre trying to impress someone, thats the real waelth
