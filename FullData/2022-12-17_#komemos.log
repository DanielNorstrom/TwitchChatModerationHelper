[2022-12-17 12:23:22] <%whiffhashira> @Rivellonn i'll probably use raiden XQ nahida and kazuah 1st and ningguang, ZL, bennet and someone else 2nd

[2022-12-17 12:23:42] <DoNot_Need> i already have c1 raiden should I go for scara or wait for raiden ? iam at 71 pity  @komemos
[2022-12-17 12:23:53] <%packedskye> @DoNot_Need honestly depends on what you want to play ig. If ur satisfied with raiden I'd go for wanderer or if you want more dmg..c2 raiden
[2022-12-17 12:23:58] <i_am_the_wei> ass
[2022-12-17 12:24:03] <ThatOneBennettMain> c6 itto is the most fun c6 of all. c6 yelan / eula are the most powerful. c6 dori is still weaker than thoma.
