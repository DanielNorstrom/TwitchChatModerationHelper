[2022-12-09 10:54:20] <CyOrion> I think some niche producers make CRTs.
[2022-12-09 10:54:27] <+masumi_tv> I also heard it's illegal to manufacture any more, at least in some countries.

[2022-12-09 10:54:41] <%godot_was_here> they are probably wasteful to make yeah
[2022-12-09 10:55:00] <CyOrion> Yeah, there haven't been tons of them made for 12 or 15 years.
[2022-12-09 10:55:18] <JensenRabbit> probably forest spirits kinda thing
[2022-12-09 10:55:27] <Blizzinam> I think the only manufacturing is military at this point, replacing CRTs on submarines and shit.

[2022-12-09 12:55:24] <@%KafroHudrep> the art style changes in the demon souls remake are enough that people think it's a point of contention rather than just a straight upgrade
[2022-12-09 12:55:33] <%+fittyyen> its kinda funny how theres a game design through line of zelda to darksouls
[2022-12-09 12:55:38] <%godot_was_here> yeah they really messed with the art style a lot
[2022-12-09 12:55:39] <%+Hellbacon> Terrible system, but they made it slightly better in the  remake
[2022-12-09 12:55:40] <+masumi_tv> Demons Souls will be released on PC. The initial announcement leaked it on accident until they quickly fixed it
[2022-12-09 12:55:41] <@%KafroHudrep> this is the shop

[2022-12-09 12:56:28] <Moshmallow980> There was a ton of people insisting Demon Souls was the real best of all, but I think it was just people upset at popularity
[2022-12-09 12:56:28] <@%KafroHudrep> you actually turn into a baby in this game and you are known as a "boss baby"
