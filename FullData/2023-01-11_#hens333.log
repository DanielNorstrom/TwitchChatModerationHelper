[2023-01-11 14:37:44] <%ClussyHonks> with the new survivor hud, communication is still bad because some people will still not understand when to be on a gen

[2023-01-11 14:43:16] <asyashi> i hope they design more killers that just chase for you
[2023-01-11 14:43:27] <jayhena> but why are people playing knight then hmmgie
[2023-01-11 14:43:33] <JulianCalabasas> I wish they buff patrol even more and nerf instaspawning even just a smidge
[2023-01-11 14:43:41] <%ClussyHonks> is this the same Knight??? this one has stbfl as well
[2023-01-11 14:43:42] <@%Loni1211> interesting plays thinkies
[2023-01-11 14:43:57] <%ClussyHonks> no its not nevermind
[2023-01-11 14:44:05] <@%roxannagv> @ClussyHonks it's just a common perk for knights
[2023-01-11 14:44:11] <%babyjuice20> @ClussyHonks stbfl is very common
[2023-01-11 14:44:12] <JulianCalabasas> I like macro in soloq carniverisCry
[2023-01-11 14:44:26] <%ClussyHonks> ive never seen a knight with stbfl lmao
[2023-01-11 14:44:35] <@%Loni1211> +if you just dont like macro plays in general as a solo surv

[2023-01-11 14:46:20] <%the_oracle_> bold of you to assume solo q survivors think peeBrain
[2023-01-11 14:46:22] <horsey_4> status hud is so interesting!!!
[2023-01-11 14:46:23] <@%Loni1211> i mean idk if it counts as macro but making plays with multiple survs whilst in soloQ is nice, i guess thats more coordination tho
[2023-01-11 14:46:24] <+TrashMaster_exe> thats what hyperfocus is for, keeps the skillchecks fun XD

[2023-01-11 14:48:35] <%+Dean_N64> I switched skill checks to F because of the old space bar mash would make me randomly give up

[2023-01-11 14:49:07] <asyashi> the worst are the macro killers that are basically designed to bully soloq like twins
[2023-01-11 14:49:09] <%+Dean_N64> im happy second stage mashing is gone btw
[2023-01-11 14:49:22] <Keksschuetze> Maybe you have to explain what macro and micro are
[2023-01-11 14:49:33] <Snife777> Mouse is 100% the way to go for skillschecks
[2023-01-11 14:49:33] <%ClussyHonks> !lurk i will be back in some 20 odd minutes
[2023-01-11 14:49:34] <@%^Nightbot> hensLurk ClussyHonks, have a comfy lurk!
[2023-01-11 14:49:34] <%+thawrathchild> I use mouse to drop pallets as well
[2023-01-11 14:49:44] <asyashi> twins is just a coordination check for the survivors
[2023-01-11 14:49:48] <sosadheart> what if every match in the game would most have a duo queue? so every solo queue player will have a 2-3 man swf with them and another solo queue player
[2023-01-11 14:49:49] <jayhena> @Keksschuetze he explains it 5 times per stream these days, it gets kinda repetitive
[2023-01-11 14:49:57] <@%Ana1661> One of the first things I did was binding skill checks to M4
[2023-01-11 14:50:07] <Iriish1911> Will the new tome and rift be dropping today, does anyone know?
[2023-01-11 14:50:10] <asyashi> i think pretty much everyone likes open maps more
[2023-01-11 14:50:19] <asap_kiah> Who woulf you say is a good micro killer? Killers like Slinger and Huntress?
[2023-01-11 14:50:36] <JulianCalabasas> Yes that's how I feel
[2023-01-11 14:50:44] <@%Ana1661> @Iriish1911 Usually one rift doesn't drop straight after the other
[2023-01-11 14:50:55] <@%roxannagv> sadly
[2023-01-11 14:50:55] <@%Loni1211> hmm might try rebinding stuff hmmgie i dont rlly have problems with hitting skill checks or sth tho

[2023-01-11 14:54:31] <horsey_4> both my m5 and m4 are already bound to stuff so i cant really bind it there
[2023-01-11 14:54:36] <@%roxannagv> are you admitting to lying then ana otzNotes careful
[2023-01-11 14:54:36] <jayhena> hitting skill checks on not stable, less than 60 fps COPIUM

[2023-01-11 14:54:46] <%+Dean_N64> I guess the controller equivalent of space bar is using a trigger for skill check
