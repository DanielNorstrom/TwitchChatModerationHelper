[2023-01-04 08:42:49] <NettyWerk> WAIT, snapple has caffeine
[2023-01-04 08:43:00] <%emessar> wait, there's more caffeine in a bottle of snapple than in a can of coke? grumpy41Notes
[2023-01-04 08:43:15] <%CharlottePosting> based
[2023-01-04 08:43:24] <%CharlottePosting> snaple has a lot of sugar
[2023-01-04 08:43:26] <NettyWerk> I think it's the "tea" flavored snapple. Usually they're just fruit juice
[2023-01-04 08:43:39] <%emessar> I knew it had sugar, but they are looking at caffeine only I think
[2023-01-04 08:44:02] <%mister__raf> dani gayming
[2023-01-04 08:44:17] <NettyWerk> 400mg of caffeine is also about 4 cups of coffee.
