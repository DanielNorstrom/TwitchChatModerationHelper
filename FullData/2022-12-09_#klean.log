[2022-12-09 00:00:24] <+MrFloomp> Sounds like anyone who plays this needs a mentor to learn it.

[2022-12-09 00:00:43] <!%Sacriel> regarding the crazy thing, its not that they dont have something to do, its that they sometimes get inspired and go crazy if you dont let them act on it, it happens rarely
[2022-12-09 00:00:48] <derped_up> you got a metal working station like to smith stuff
[2022-12-09 00:01:01] <!%Sacriel> did you flag all those bedrooms with the Z tool?
[2022-12-09 00:01:06] <derped_up> remember to place the slab!

[2022-12-09 00:01:24] <Grinbale> it all can go down real quick
[2022-12-09 00:01:25] <%+imexicanbatmani> @Klean dont forget him this time LUL
[2022-12-09 00:01:25] <!%Sacriel> if it says hes working then hes good to go, its bad if hes saying materials like "bone, metal, leather"
[2022-12-09 00:01:27] <Z_ynthia> he managed to find everything he needs and now hes making an artifact
[2022-12-09 00:01:32] <fur3x> he might be making some artifact or something
[2022-12-09 00:01:36] <@%SpottedTango> if he's working secretly -- that means he's got what he needs and is now making a legendary
[2022-12-09 00:01:37] <derped_up> works secretly is good

[2022-12-09 00:03:10] <Z_ynthia> @Klean under objects u should be able to read what the cage is made of and the value
[2022-12-09 00:03:11] <+DeadlyDays> both are iron
[2022-12-09 00:03:11] <bobakanuse> there should be a screen with info on what it smelt into
[2022-12-09 00:03:14] <!%Sacriel> and set them to 'auto craft iron bars when we run out" instead of having to track it yourself
[2022-12-09 00:03:19] <Burepishta> Yep, mag is an iron ore
[2022-12-09 00:03:21] <thatrulegend27> hows it going @Klean ?
[2022-12-09 00:03:23] <%Howkin_> you dont want to showcase your artifacts until you have a military to defend them

[2022-12-09 02:49:23] <owlstronaut> Is it like ONI?
[2022-12-09 02:50:14] <skrzynek> @owlstronaut Mostly RimWorld, because RimWorld was based on DF in many aspects :v
[2022-12-09 02:50:23] <+THEOZygamerr> Dwarf Fortress the only game where you can weaponize a bridge
[2022-12-09 02:50:56] <+DeadlyDays> executioner
[2022-12-09 02:50:57] <owlstronaut> @skrzynek is it worth? D:
[2022-12-09 02:51:03] <skrzynek> also the only game where the game simulated the state of every single tooth the dwarf has.
[2022-12-09 02:51:04] <NorthernGambit> executioner yeh LUL
