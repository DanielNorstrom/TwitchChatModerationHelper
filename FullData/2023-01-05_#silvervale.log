[2023-01-05 07:40:48] <P4riah> i think new players should make careful use of the wiki, going to it with very specific questions then closing it to avoid spoilers

[2023-01-05 09:42:10] <PigWithoutProtection> I learned that the new Focus schools has made eidolon hunts go waaay faster, since I can now blast their shields in about a second with an old flamethrower amp. was kinda fun to find out

[2023-01-05 09:42:39] <avg_adams> volt is also really good for eidos because when you shoot through his shields, it multiplies your damage which is very fun
