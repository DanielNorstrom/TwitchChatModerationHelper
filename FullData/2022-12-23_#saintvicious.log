[2022-12-23 01:28:41] <+two32am> it was more fun when there wasnt an  addon that told you what to force imo
[2022-12-23 01:29:29] <%+uberspidey> I do think stats have warped the game a bit

[2022-12-23 01:30:20] <!%fatguy925> smiteHmm Since more people have data easier, the meta shifts faster and people play certain builds more often.
[2022-12-23 01:30:27] <!%fatguy925> but thats me speculation how
[2022-12-23 01:30:30] <+two32am> idk why yummi rips so hard lol
[2022-12-23 01:30:45] <vrasp> what he means is "the game was more fun when i was still learning how to play"

[2022-12-23 01:30:54] <vrasp> in which case, just don't look at the stats and learn on your own AYAYA
[2022-12-23 01:30:55] <KorgosWoW> it feels way harder to one trick this set imo
[2022-12-23 01:31:11] <+two32am> see im talking about casually. i dont play ranked. so its less fun now cause people can hard force shit
[2022-12-23 01:31:24] <darothy> learning to play sucked ccause i ddint know what anything did lol
[2022-12-23 01:31:27] <vrasp> i think your view is warped
[2022-12-23 01:31:28] <vrasp> most people are casual
[2022-12-23 01:31:36] <%+Cale199> i liked the game better when no one knew how to play
[2022-12-23 01:31:36] <vrasp> once they get 'good enough' or reach their perceived cap, they don't care anymore
[2022-12-23 01:31:39] <+Arcane_Eli> I mean everygame you can learn something different with hero augments no?

[2022-12-23 01:32:19] <AlastorDMC> bro i started playing casually set 6 and hit master the whole fun of the game is learning
[2022-12-23 01:32:22] <toxicbubba21> I try but still loose
[2022-12-23 01:32:27] <AlastorDMC> and i still dont know jack shit

[2022-12-23 01:33:08] <MasterSodaLol> ppl are probably saying that they can't climb as fast and are kinda stuck now
[2022-12-23 01:33:11] <vrasp> the point of a game is to have fun i think
[2022-12-23 01:33:15] <vrasp> but also to win
[2022-12-23 01:33:15] <KorgosWoW> winning is fun
[2022-12-23 01:33:24] <AlastorDMC> i get it for other games but tft is basically all knowledge
[2022-12-23 01:33:28] <%+Nogo_1R> The point of a competitive ladder ranked ladder system is definitely to win and learn/improve.

[2022-12-23 01:34:08] <!%fatguy925> I thought tft is climbing to see saint in ladder, and comp him every game ? /s
[2022-12-23 01:34:12] <+Arcane_Eli> if I tried to winwin, I'd yuumi 20/20 and be at least plat.
