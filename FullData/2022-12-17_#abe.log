[2022-12-17 23:02:39] <%$Tawnnie> baboH
[2022-12-17 23:03:00] <%$Tawnnie> Is free sub automated that speed was insane
[2022-12-17 23:03:07] <%+Addrax> the smart way to balance it out would to figure who tcrafted the most then let people keep enough shards to make that many orbs and then burn the rest
[2022-12-17 23:03:11] <KiiWiiiii> if a game makes changes, they usually dont ask players to get rid of the spoils, might be different, cuz you are all friends etc, but still

[2022-12-17 23:03:26] <%+LaLaBriar> @Tawnnie nah he was just looking at chat
[2022-12-17 23:03:51] <+Im_A_Cat_Im_A_Kitty_Cat> Honestly the skill dust/shards isn't even the main factor for making the skill orbs. Its the black opal.
[2022-12-17 23:03:54] VIEWERS: 485
[2022-12-17 23:04:05] <%$Tawnnie> I see @lalabriar he was talking about automating it lol
[2022-12-17 23:04:06] <%+HydroDyne> but if you burn all the essence and they take skills away ... you still lose out on what you would have gotten at the rate they want
[2022-12-17 23:04:26] <%$Tawnnie> Maybe burning half make sense
[2022-12-17 23:04:29] <+dragster6711> were skill orb values over balanced ??
[2022-12-17 23:04:38] <%f0laaaaa> Hmm would the ore change in the vault affect the black Opal finding rate for lower levels?
[2022-12-17 23:04:52] <+dragster6711> whats going on just joined :D
[2022-12-17 23:05:03] <%$Tawnnie> Meal time
[2022-12-17 23:05:04] <KiiWiiiii> nah, beni and lari are affected in lower vaults

[2022-12-17 23:05:33] <KiiWiiiii> @dragster6711 skill dust too much, getting nerfed, players asked to burn skill dust
[2022-12-17 23:05:33] <%+LaLaBriar> If you had skill points taken away would you be refunded the other crafting mats? bc that's a lot of opal
[2022-12-17 23:05:47] <KiiWiiiii> ^ ofc not

[2022-12-17 23:05:56] <KiiWiiiii> they wouldnt do that ofc
[2022-12-17 23:06:11] <%$Tawnnie> They didn‚Äôt refund gold for 10%
[2022-12-17 23:06:12] <+Im_A_Cat_Im_A_Kitty_Cat> @f0laaaaa Yes black opal is more rare in lower level vaults since the last phase 1 ore update. With beni and lari being more prominent.
[2022-12-17 23:06:19] <%$Tawnnie> pepeLaugh
[2022-12-17 23:06:21] <%f0laaaaa> @lalabriar I think that's where this is getting messy bc it's hard to balance that out
[2022-12-17 23:06:50] <KiiWiiiii> just burn current supplies of dust, keep the skillpoints is best, at least on this server
[2022-12-17 23:07:12] <%puppyman25_> Did you bring enough to share with the class mr strimmer
[2022-12-17 23:07:30] <%$Tawnnie> Compare with Kara
[2022-12-17 23:07:32] <KiiWiiiii> you 2 are also best looters on the server, that plays a big part too
[2022-12-17 23:07:35] <silvia249> Does the raffle tickets work?
[2022-12-17 23:07:45] <sunshinesusie> x per level, maybe
[2022-12-17 23:07:54] VIEWERS: 468
[2022-12-17 23:07:57] <%DrTasslehoff> Considering how it relies heavily on how much you loot gilded chests, there's not really a good metric for expected amount
[2022-12-17 23:07:58] <+SuiteSunrise> probably just don't do any retroactive awarding
[2022-12-17 23:08:02] <%timeisnearlyover> in previous seasons the restricting factor was always skill essence rather than black opal holding players back from crafting skill orbs
[2022-12-17 23:08:07] <%little_dahlia> Abe did you connect raffle yet?
[2022-12-17 23:08:24] <%+HydroDyne> they would have to determine how many of whatever type of chest they spawn in and how many of those chest you have looted

[2022-12-17 23:08:30] <KiiWiiiii> from what i've seen, you guys are about even, but you are a bit better imho
