To me, this is a grievous oversight that must be immediately rectified. Please add this card to your deck forthwith or I will be left with no recourse but to unfollow. Again, the card I am suggesting you add is 4 Siege Rhinos. Thank You.

[2023-01-04 17:17:27] <epicachilles> @loveandmushrooms too many creature types in the actual game would weaken tribal support, so no sorcerer type or paladin type (instead using shaman or knight)

[2023-01-04 18:14:03] <zabelb> The mana base was actually better with 80 cards because of the ability to have triomes but be less likely to draw them. I think that keeping the same 80 and just not registering a companion is better than a 60 card version.

I think keeping vial in is correct but wanted to get your thoughts. Vial is so strong but the constant removal it eats + more potential goblin bodies is interesting to me
[2023-01-04 18:14:33] <%+LaffAtU> Good riddance, I say. That deck was miserable to play against
[2023-01-04 18:14:33] <%+Koskadelli> @zabelb I buy into this a bit, but I think the right answer is something more than 60 but less than 80
[2023-01-04 18:14:33] <+jingojoe> They want the haste lol
[2023-01-04 18:14:43] <%Aquinas9> What happened to Spike's theory that Omnath piles would get better if Yorion got banned? He said Yorion was only necessary for the mirror matches but made you worse against the field.

[2023-01-04 19:30:11] <+the_noblestman> @aspiringspike So, if I understand correctly, it's just accepting that there are always polarizing cards you will lose to, and so long as those cards aren't too common, accepting that if they want to beat you with it they will?
[2023-01-04 19:30:18] <@%+esqpoe> bolted the thing that doesn't matter

[2023-01-04 19:32:28] <DOOTFIVE> probably been asked already, but can you pay an untap cost with a summoning sick creature?
[2023-01-04 19:32:29] <alias_taken> we dont generate mana while looping right? since we make 1 pay 1 right?

[2023-01-04 19:34:15] <alias_taken> thats just a different deck
[2023-01-04 19:34:16] <$argentorum> @aspiringspike you can win if they tap out as long as you tap double white for puresight merrow, on the last activation you can tap puresight for a blue to have UU for oracle

[2023-01-04 19:34:54] <+BeardedDG> Hey semi new to the game what’s the best way to learn the game other than just practicing and getting reps?
[2023-01-04 19:34:59] <@%Squee_GoblinNabob> 4 bolt 1-2 terminate 2-3 push

[2023-01-04 19:35:06] <+mista_wyan> @aspiringspike I think you give awesome advise. Thank you. Me (a newish player) learning that I can’t hedge against everything AND ACCEPTING that I’m going to lose to efficient SB cards was tough to learn and you have helped me with that.
[2023-01-04 19:35:10] <xlovexhoney> If I don’t have 4th shredder for grixis shadow for fnm should I play like one Kroxa??
[2023-01-04 19:35:13] <maletintohs> mmm they can have another push another bolt heat etc but we have to try it I suppose
[2023-01-04 19:35:14] <+puntcity> Damn I was hoping to catch the deckbuiding of this deck I was here when you were theory crafting. How do you like it?
[2023-01-04 19:35:24] <jamjarrs> SPIIKE READ MY COMMENT lol you don't need to tutor Thoracle,, You find it in your upkeep then you draw it and continue
[2023-01-04 19:35:35] <@theeguy420> @BeardedDG besides that, what you're doing now - watching skilled players play
[2023-01-04 19:35:38] <@%phuckingmagikal> This is going to be a lot of clicks.
[2023-01-04 19:35:39] <huge_sesh> i think they are very nervous about the revealed oracle and dont know what to do
[2023-01-04 19:35:40] <!%+illusions_donate_gg> maybe Oracle and respond trigger on the stack so OP knows we have game
[2023-01-04 19:35:40] <@%Iron_Blood> I would hold w and just keep clicking

[2023-01-04 19:35:56] <+gwdinosaurs> is it not better to put the oracle trigger on the stack and then do it? in case they have a counter

[2023-01-04 20:06:01] <@%Dragonlord_Freya> Dear MTGO User AspiringSpike: I noticed your decklist does not contain the Magic: the Gathering card Random [Insert grindy 3 drop]. It'll be good in the grindy matchups like UW control which I've heard is the hardest deck to pilot, much harder than this one. To me, this is a grievous oversight that must be immediately rectified. Please add this card to your deck forthwith or I will be left with no recourse but to unfollow. Again, the card I am suggesting you add is Random 4-drop. Thank You.

If no creatures are currently blocking it (if, for example, they were destroyed or removed from combat), it assigns no combat damage. If exactly one creature is blocking it, it assigns all its combat damage to that creature. If two or more creatures are blocking it, it assigns its combat damage to those creatures according to the damage assignment order announced for it. This may allow the blocked creature to

However, it can’t assign combat damage to a creature that’s blocking it unless, when combat damage assignments are complete, each creature that precedes that blocking creature in its order is assigned lethal damage. When checking for assigned lethal damage, take into account damage already marked on the creature and damage from other creatures that’s being assigned during the same combat damage step, but not any abilities or effects that might change the amount of

During the declare blockers step, the defending player casts Giant Growth targeting Pride Guardian, which gives it +3/+3 until end of turn. Vastwood Gorger must assign its 5 damage to the Guardian.
[2023-01-04 20:13:24] <@%^MTGBot> defending player casts Mending Hands targeting Pride Guardian, which prevents the next 4 damage that would be dealt to it. Vastwood Gorger can assign 3 damage to the Guardian and 2 damage to the Elves, 4 damage to the Guardian and 1 damage to the Elves, or 5 damage to the Guardian.

The damage assignment order of an attacking Durkwood Boars (a 4/4 creature) is the same Foriysian Brigade, then Goblin Piker (a 2/1 creature). Among other possibilities, the active player may have the Baloth assign 1 damage to the Armodon, 1 damage to the Brigade, and 5 damage to the Ape, and have the Boars assign 3 damage to the Brigade and 1 damage to the Piker.

[2023-01-04 20:25:56] <zapyourtumor> @TheMintTest yorion was like the big guaranteed late game value engine that 4c had after grinding the game to a halt so without that guaranteed card anymore its harder for 4c to generate insane amounts of value

[2023-01-04 21:10:15] <Penguin_FTW> the elden ring any% run is faster than the ds1 any% i think

[2023-01-04 21:11:44] <%+moosemaster17> @ozkantheflip in elden ring you can do summons only, which is technically not hitting any enemies lol

[2023-01-04 21:48:51] <@%FourDogsInAHorseSuit> Did you just fall into an open world of eldin ring.
[2023-01-04 21:48:59] <%+sinalco87> you need to talk to Alma to calm them down

[2023-01-04 21:55:18] <@The_Last_God_> @aspiringspike oh you can just use bow and arrow to actually cheese him, you just gotta halaberd dodge the scream
[2023-01-04 21:55:28] <%Fleecemane34> love the variety stream. keep up the great work
[2023-01-04 21:55:36] <%+PlaneshiftWill> Plus you need to practice the 2nd half of hte game as well

[2023-01-04 21:59:39] <%Aquinas9> @Fleecemane34 Blind playthrough is absolutely the best way to play. I was grinding through the Tomb of the Giants before I even realized how to reach Capra Demon and the Depths.
[2023-01-04 21:59:44] <@The_Last_God_> its more of how the game counts
[2023-01-04 21:59:53] <@The_Last_God_> its intentional just wierd
[2023-01-04 21:59:58] <%+moosemaster17> more of an exploit perhaps
[2023-01-04 22:00:09] <%+PlaneshiftWill> The game just counts how many times you awoke mimics
[2023-01-04 22:00:11] <%+felixrda> so you want the symbol or no?
[2023-01-04 22:00:13] <%+PlaneshiftWill> Technically intended mechanic
[2023-01-04 22:00:28] <%$Ocara115> Im sure nothing bad happened up above you
[2023-01-04 22:00:33] <+dorox1> It's like "after you've woken up 6 mimics", and putting them to sleep lets you wake them up again

[2023-01-04 22:01:31] <%+moosemaster17> @felixrda yes because it helps set up a damage buff by lowering our health
