[2022-12-29 00:12:43] <+tobmiafps> It‚Äôs a very expensive gaming chair if it is - very human like
[2022-12-29 00:12:44] <sononawa497> looks legit
[2022-12-29 00:12:44] <altforce0909> That was too smooth
[2022-12-29 00:12:49] <va_firemedic> He‚Äôs way too good at flicking into slowing way down
[2022-12-29 00:12:50] <INeadHealing> I know you're not happy with me sleeping with your mother but it doesn't have to be like that @47vl
[2022-12-29 00:12:59] <+imprzival> thats legit wdym
[2022-12-29 00:13:07] <+DeatheyeHC> no cheating so far
[2022-12-29 00:13:11] <va_firemedic> That‚Äôs one thing for widow to hit the shot on a flick but to be tracking spastic into so many precise flicks
[2022-12-29 00:13:13] <gendalfgray> nah seems legit
[2022-12-29 00:13:14] <nimbuscloako1> idk looks kinda sus to me

[2022-12-29 00:13:29] <INeadHealing> like im the type of guy to sleep with your mother and dip I wouldn't bother you @47vl
[2022-12-29 00:13:33] <+ceneus_> his like predictive tracking does not look natural
[2022-12-29 00:13:35] <+DeatheyeHC> looks like you false reported him
[2022-12-29 00:13:35] <+tobmiafps> As Widow player current in GM these don‚Äôt looks terrible - maybe wall hack
[2022-12-29 00:13:36] <Icyeyeow> how did they still loose with cheater?
[2022-12-29 00:13:39] <Blackhawk_N1> either he's god at tracking or idk
[2022-12-29 00:13:45] <KEVMAN2020> its okay to feel these emotions @INeadHealing having these kinds of dreams you are talking about is a stage of depression if you need to talk about something i am up for it ! as i said i offer counseling

[2022-12-29 00:30:21] <Ashmaterial> Thank you for Junkrat recommendation. Junkrat is my favourite character. His weapon projectile is so hard to predict and also so hard to hit. And his traps make enemy heroes paranoiac all the time. He is ultimate Jester character. And when he dies he doesnt just fall. He leaves his explosive balls behind him making last enemy standing die to unexpected death. I love Jankrat balls. They are my favorite
