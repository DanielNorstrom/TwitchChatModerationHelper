[2022-12-19 20:50:18] <%TheseGoodGames> @acraine1 yea, i think a lot of ppl are still learning, and most people don't read the rules and such.
[2022-12-19 20:50:42] <+BamaMophi> I had to do a 1v8 in this game mode before as Bakasura. I was farming my brains out and went 24-0 before the 10 minute mark, but 1 person worth of gold still goes nowhere close to 2 person‚Äôs worth of gold
[2022-12-19 20:50:42] <%+lightforceten> they'll probably have it for some smite nights

[2022-12-19 20:54:34] <%+acraine1> It can be yes. I think the issue stems from farm being worth more than kills

[2022-12-19 22:06:40] <+fizzyford> Cyno is the 5 star version of Razor now

[2022-12-19 22:07:14] <+BamaMophi> Funny thing is when the game came out, some of the current best 4 stars were considered trash until people actually read what they did and why they were op
[2022-12-19 22:07:25] <ChrysNeoVX> @fizzyford No, he isnt, razor and cyno are veeeery different
[2022-12-19 22:07:27] <%siv0r> this game looks boaring

[2022-12-19 22:10:07] <ChrysNeoVX> @Xiova13 Cyno relies a lot on reactions while Razor is a physical dps. Razor can do damage outside burst, cyno otherwise... without ult cant do "a lot"
