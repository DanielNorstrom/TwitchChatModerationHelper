[2022-12-19 20:36:48] <suh710> Most streamers that live off streaming make enough via sponsorships, donos, and subs to sustain themselves comfortably. Look at Od26, dudes about to make 100k a year just coaching and streaming a bit. If you’re only income in 100 subs a month its tough, but no one has to deal with that alone.
