[2023-01-03 19:23:38] <%Kamikaze17> huh, that may be why I'm not noticing issues - I always have the stream on mobile so it can be better in the background and always in view while multitasking
[2023-01-03 19:24:07] <%Kamikaze17> but I still have chat on PC for better typing and in case buffering goes too hard on delays
[2023-01-03 19:24:10] <+ChillPillVT> I barely ever use mobile but I didn't feel like getting out of bed yet so mobile is the move today lol
[2023-01-03 19:24:41] <%Kamikaze17> as for the song it is a mood, but mostly for background music

[2023-01-03 19:29:11] <%pml103> refresh is ok but you better know the url to the stream if you close your browser
[2023-01-03 19:29:16] <%Kamikaze17> wonder if using the direct link on mobile firefox would work
[2023-01-03 19:29:50] <%Kamikaze17> and yeah, the "ok-ish, but just for a background track and nothing else" seems to be a theme with this queue
