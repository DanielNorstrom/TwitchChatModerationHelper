[2022-12-21 17:54:42] <@^Nightbot> My favorite streamer is LHChair. he is very dark, has great lumbar support, and honestly he carries the stream when Cloudy is gone. He comes equipped with a very powerful height adjusting lever that’s perfect for our favorite streamer. LHChair doesn’t interact much so it’s really helps when chat can make their own content

[2022-12-21 19:15:20] <%yiisusjr> @LhCloudy27 hey bro, greetings from spain lhcloudyLove lhcloudyLove
[2022-12-21 19:15:32] <%iPRIxMAi> Unless it's like Froggies44
[2022-12-21 19:15:56] <PlNKDOVE> tbh in ranked i dont think most lucios even GM+ understand being annoying to her is their job
[2022-12-21 19:16:19] <PlNKDOVE> true
[2022-12-21 19:16:28] <wiltsu__> can you tell why lucio should fight tracer?
[2022-12-21 19:16:35] <botoxication> lucio have good passive heal
[2022-12-21 19:16:36] <$marodas2> Dont tell that to metal ranks PepeLaugh
[2022-12-21 19:16:41] <botoxication> it takes tracer many clips
[2022-12-21 19:16:45] <%MintJamz> It's hard to actually 1v1 a tracer as a lucio, but you can do enough damage to make tracer back off
[2022-12-21 19:16:47] <%LPD_75> 4 lucio headshots kill tracer
[2022-12-21 19:16:50] <botoxication> lucio has mobility to contest tracer
[2022-12-21 19:17:01] <botoxication> he just has to force tracer away from off angle
[2022-12-21 19:17:09] <%iPRIxMAi> That was a diamond Lucio
[2022-12-21 19:17:09] <+Qffset> does lucio damage have dropoff?
[2022-12-21 19:17:10] VIEWERS: 551
[2022-12-21 19:17:12] <botoxication> lucio has heal amp for other support
[2022-12-21 19:17:19] <botoxication> lucio damage has no drop off
[2022-12-21 19:17:20] <wiltsu__> i see NODDERS
[2022-12-21 19:17:20] <Hairc> @Qffset no
[2022-12-21 19:17:23] <%iPRIxMAi> U2GM tracer should never die to a reddit lucio lol
[2022-12-21 19:17:29] <%ClaziOni> what kind of winstreak are we going rn?
[2022-12-21 19:17:42] <%MintJamz> Funnyastro still loses to owl tracer players in a pure 1v1 situation most of the time
[2022-12-21 19:17:44] <botoxication> lucio peeling for backline isnt redditing
[2022-12-21 19:17:48] <$JonTurn> who was the tracer?
[2022-12-21 19:18:08] <J0nnemus> magicturtle and mirkkis hae thrown like 3 games for me and then blamed my rein
[2022-12-21 19:18:11] <Hollow111> I feel like it's more about denying tracer plays rather than killing her
[2022-12-21 19:18:11] <%MintJamz> I mean if there are no health packs then lucio wins
[2022-12-21 19:18:14] <J0nnemus> luckily I'm not in that rank anymore
[2022-12-21 19:18:15] <Hollow111> but what do I know
[2022-12-21 19:18:19] <%iPRIxMAi> I honestly think your tracer needed to peel for ana/kiri.  If he'd have done that - you would have won
[2022-12-21 19:18:35] <%iPRIxMAi> Genji wasn't
[2022-12-21 19:19:03] <%iPRIxMAi> I mean she shouldn't have been ana either I agree

[2022-12-21 19:37:42] <$JonTurn> I feel like these U2GMs kinda show that tanks isnt as OP carry role as people pretend. Even best tanks don't carry 100% wr, but ive seen dps do it

[2022-12-21 23:23:01] <%Austriansamurai1> the speedboost in nemesis form was such a good buff
[2022-12-21 23:23:16] <$lush0W> That I feel is not really rewarding
[2022-12-21 23:23:35] <sarcas89> Yea i know and you can do it, but you got to end it sooner or later. If you can make a high rank ram only you could go rein/ram on main
[2022-12-21 23:23:35] <$lush0W> Fair point
[2022-12-21 23:23:43] <+Xeffary> the problem is you have the same problem when your rank drops at the start of the season you have the same problem
