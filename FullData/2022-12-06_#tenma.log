[2022-12-06 02:12:43] <Nuumers> nah she's using the wrong ability
[2022-12-06 02:12:49] <DanteKorvinus> maybe wingdude is right and you cant touch ground 🤔
[2022-12-06 02:13:26] <ParaLogia> Sorry if you already tried, but can you rebound off of them?
[2022-12-06 02:13:51] <acticlacid> Iirc bash works but it’s been like 2 years since I played ori so I might be wrong
