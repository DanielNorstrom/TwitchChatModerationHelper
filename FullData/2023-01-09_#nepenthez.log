[2023-01-09 01:08:35] <ZTC7> Last year I saved 180 packs and I got 5 TOTYs
[2023-01-09 01:08:36] <OmarA20111> Every-time i saved packs in Fifa i ended up quitting before opening them

[2023-01-09 01:08:45] <@%+DavidMNobrega> I reckon TOTY's are going to be MEGA hard to pack, like next to impossible. Hope I'm wrong
[2023-01-09 01:08:53] <SmithyK97> maybe we might get a toty warm up again
[2023-01-09 01:08:54] <@%+DavidMNobrega> They're giving way too many good packs out for people to save
[2023-01-09 01:08:54] <Btsvfan> start on the 20th
[2023-01-09 01:09:00] <rayyan120703> 20th is the start for attackers
[2023-01-09 01:09:03] <kevpies42> January 20th
[2023-01-09 01:09:08] <%hazzat1345> I had over 100 saved but opened them all to do Zidane, it was worth it
[2023-01-09 01:09:13] <fx1476> if no one can pack a winter wildcard then NO ONE is packing toty's
[2023-01-09 01:09:15] <zizo_00> Is there a no warm up?
[2023-01-09 01:09:16] <JoaoPimpao99> that sounds right
[2023-01-09 01:09:21] <jackh0bbs> predictions for NLD nep
[2023-01-09 01:09:22] <+yunggibbert> attackers will be mbappe Messi and benzema I guess
[2023-01-09 01:09:23] <rayyan120703> 26th is the whole team
[2023-01-09 01:09:26] <%+kingnovakin> Tbh I wonder if ea are getting us to sink all fodder before toty with this centurion sbc
[2023-01-09 01:09:29] <%+SCF08onFIFA> 20th TOTY, 19th expiry date for League SBC's I believe, no coincidence
[2023-01-09 01:09:36] <%exclusive457> last year saved like 200 odd packs and never got close so havent got any hope for this year
[2023-01-09 01:09:37] <emad2803> U reckon we can pack toty‚Äôs in that new 80+ upgrade?
[2023-01-09 01:09:38] <itsjaysharpie> Mahrez as CAM very good
[2023-01-09 01:09:41] <%$istreet98> cent's have been easier to pack then winter wildcards, they were impossible
[2023-01-09 01:09:48] <@%+DavidMNobrega> In general FIFA tradition I do feel like they're normally generous with TOTY's as far as they can really
[2023-01-09 01:09:50] <ZTC7> @hazzat1345 What was the point in that, Zidane lasts 30 days you could‚Äôve saved for TOTY
[2023-01-09 01:09:51] <kermsx> yh we have two weeks of wildcards then toty
[2023-01-09 01:09:52] <%+Beniesta_> I either open packs now and
[2023-01-09 01:09:55] <@%+DavidMNobrega> But it's impossible to pack any specials

[2023-01-09 16:11:32] <69tw> 400 point in Academy is too hard, you need to out perform so hard , and you ll get a low tier limited. Kickoff 400 points is almost top rewards

[2023-01-09 16:31:36] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> @vendra_2 240 is where your 5 players have to have an L15 combined of under 240. If they get 250 points youll get some Eth. Its a grindy mode. Its going to replace underdog most likely. Its coming in March.
[2023-01-09 16:31:49] <@sorarejosh> not better to go into specialist limited ? 3 star rares there

[2023-01-09 16:34:55] <%hughr1983> They should have mangers on, points for good subs and wins maybe ?
[2023-01-09 16:34:56] <@sorarejosh> i saw atletico linked to wendel, which would be a disaster for him
[2023-01-09 16:35:00] <%AHumanAlien> Atlas game plus ligue 1 and ligue 2, that's it right?
[2023-01-09 16:35:04] <%+ace2ey> part of that though is bilal was literally the only possible GK, and scored 16.  u23 points are also lower than most divs

[2023-01-09 16:38:08] <@sorarejosh> its easier said than done but playing 3 gw's in advance is the best play, like if u wanted a team for this midweek should be buying them a week or two ago then either use them or sell in hype and repeat
[2023-01-09 16:38:08] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> @istreet98 2626 got the $50 threshold and 2173 got $25 this week. If we say about $21 - $22k total this week in their main pay out division. Thats over 4 days. In the last 24 hours they sold $240k in new cards. They are making lots and ltos of money.

[2023-01-09 16:49:47] <%+SCF08onFIFA> NEC just lack a proper striker. El Karouani could do great if NEC bring in a striker this window.

[2023-01-09 16:50:33] <AHumanAlien> @a920123_ He did a great job at Fulham so hopefully with some time things will come good.

[2023-01-09 16:50:38] <@%AaronBrookes94> Really, the best people to trust are the experts who are actually linked with the clubs, but it's very hard to find one willing to give team news because a majority of them don't want to risk their jobs
[2023-01-09 16:50:45] <%$istreet98> Like ITK football transfers and actual reporters like "Transfer News" and a Romano
[2023-01-09 16:50:46] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> Genuinely think the next 8 games could massively pump his price.

[2023-01-09 17:50:17] <%vendra_2> are the bundles good or is it better to pick up single cards? @SpreadsheetFifa

[2023-01-09 17:50:37] <@%AaronBrookes94> @SpreadsheetFifa Big list as well to be fair, some right dog been in the Top 50. I'm honestly surprised that stupid 'I'm a Island Boy' remix didn't hit number 1

[2023-01-09 17:51:39] <kadenlovesfifa> The fact ronaldo ain‚Äôt a nominee is a joke
[2023-01-09 17:51:44] <jsaps1871> Do you think arsenal will go for anyone else if felix is going to Chelsea?
[2023-01-09 17:51:45] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> @vendra_2 Honestly depends on the bundle and the price youre paying. You cna get good deals but often end up with cards you dont want or need
[2023-01-09 17:51:58] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> @kadenlovesfifa Is this fishing?

[2023-01-09 17:52:27] <%$alfiemayisthegoat> @SpreadsheetFifa I'd say top 50 is just generally terrible and has been for quite a long time
[2023-01-09 17:52:51] <kadenlovesfifa> I‚Äôm just genuinely wondering why Ronaldo didn‚Äôt get a nomination
[2023-01-09 17:53:05] <%$alfiemayisthegoat> What's Ronaldo done to deserve a nomination?
[2023-01-09 17:53:11] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> @kadenlovesfifa You cant seriously believe Ronaldo deserves to be anywhere near the TOTY and so saying its a joke is just fishing for a reaction right?
[2023-01-09 17:53:14] <%$JiiMiiE> wondering and calling it a joke are 2 different things..

However, in 2022, the year in question. Messi won the world cup.

[2023-01-09 18:54:56] <kruudster> Bales run of games before he left spurs the first time was out of this world
[2023-01-09 18:55:01] <jack_russell67> Bale had a couple good seasons
[2023-01-09 18:55:08] <sourenaaa> cr7 defended bale alot in press conference in RM
[2023-01-09 18:55:08] <@%Viperlization> it's crazy how much his career dropped off after that worldie bicey
[2023-01-09 18:55:12] <%$knosher1> ronaldo was mardy cause madrid paid more for bale than himself
[2023-01-09 18:55:13] <+Romanlamagna> Yeah I think they liked each other but Ronaldo didn‚Äôt want Bale to steal the limelight
[2023-01-09 18:55:13] <baggedagainffs> Bale won‚Äôt get the credit because he wasn‚Äôt English
[2023-01-09 18:55:13] <Rubendran17> Just joined the stream. Lol whats the pinned comment üòÖ You predicted it Nep ?

[2023-01-09 18:55:14] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> @SpreadsheetFifa Bale better than Salah????

[2023-01-09 18:55:15] <%+notgravityeu> Rooney was excellent much younger tbf
[2023-01-09 18:55:16] <supermercadotelebancos> Bale is clear of Beckham
[2023-01-09 18:55:16] <%+willsilva98> I think there was that mutual respect but also that thought of wow he is also amazing and is a type of threat
[2023-01-09 18:55:17] <@%Witchwalker70> Another Koka goal, nice :)
[2023-01-09 18:55:17] <%+saaj003> Bale is underrated by the current generation of TikTok and Twitter fans who didn't watch him play in his prime but "meme" him
[2023-01-09 18:55:18] <em_punk777> No thats facts
[2023-01-09 18:55:18] <%+deathskamikaze> bale won 5 ucl ffs
[2023-01-09 18:55:23] <%$coys51> @jack_russell67 this shows you are a muppet
[2023-01-09 18:55:24] <Calamus252> wasted talent, sometimes not his fault, sometimes was. Should have been the next Ronnie
[2023-01-09 18:55:27] <+arcsike> He is not even the best welsh footballer
[2023-01-09 18:55:28] <dannyvdzande1> Bale was also a big game player, he always performs when its needed the most
[2023-01-09 18:55:28] <%$JiiMiiE> "a couple good seasons" LUL I'm done
[2023-01-09 18:55:30] <%+mikekozy23> bale has one of the best UCL performances ever that one game he got subbed on
[2023-01-09 18:55:31] <yungmaseyy> Do you think the abundance of people with saved packs will have an effect on the pack weight of TOTYs?
[2023-01-09 18:55:32] <@sorarejosh> think that one yr bale under AVB was possibly the best performance from a prem player we've seen
[2023-01-09 18:55:33] <+sjm501> They werent just "good" they were truly great
[2023-01-09 18:55:33] <coffy1993> Gascogne and shearer were better than we thought yet they don‚Äôt be mentioned
[2023-01-09 18:55:34] <+Jamie602> no right foot
[2023-01-09 18:55:34] <%$nelsonscolumn77> Bale would have been in the to
[2023-01-09 18:55:35] <em_punk777> He had a couple at spurs and a couple at madrid, thats it
[2023-01-09 18:55:35] <%Sbradley08> Bale has multiple big moments as well, cup final goal vs Barca, bicyccle kick vs LFC, etc.
[2023-01-09 18:55:36] <@%Viperlization> bale > salah for sure for me
[2023-01-09 18:55:36] <dcr05> @arcsike who is then?
[2023-01-09 18:55:37] <concreteron91> Fairly early to retire 33 no?
[2023-01-09 18:55:39] <sourenaaa> cr7 also defended bale when bernabeu booed him
[2023-01-09 18:55:40] <shebanimoad> He‚Äôs phenomenal but not every time. He was moody at times didn‚Äôt even try to make an effort
[2023-01-09 18:55:40] <%+hiimsausageman> salah better than bale for sure
[2023-01-09 18:55:43] <%+FBSLeo> who had a better career eden hazard or bale?
[2023-01-09 18:55:44] <%+saaj003> Bale won Real at least 2 UCLs
[2023-01-09 18:55:47] <%exclusive457> do you think any EOE or flashback bale would be at LAFC or just for wales?
[2023-01-09 18:55:47] <andyfaeeyy> Vitzeh has dropped a Rooney video üíØ what a player
[2023-01-09 18:55:52] <+joedr621> bale
[2023-01-09 18:55:53] <harry8497> Outside Messi and Ronaldo he was the best player in the world 2013/14
[2023-01-09 18:55:54] VIEWERS: 2¬†123
[2023-01-09 18:55:55] <%+tobywankenobi101> Bale was such a clutch player
[2023-01-09 18:55:55] <jenguslogantwopoint0> Bale was one of my favourite players from young age
[2023-01-09 18:55:55] <%+shane_melaugh123> Bale is still for sure behind Rooney
[2023-01-09 18:55:59] <ksaestad> how good would bale be if he went to man united instead of going to spain=
[2023-01-09 18:56:01] <deziixixv> id take robben tho
[2023-01-09 18:56:01] <%+xjay100x> nah he was a winger
[2023-01-09 18:56:02] <+joedr621> bales recent season at spurs is underrated
[2023-01-09 18:56:04] <fttammorgan> His goal against Barca where he sent Batra to the shops was unreal!
[2023-01-09 18:56:05] <%+tobywankenobi101> Nah he was a winger and only player that could score for us
[2023-01-09 18:56:06] <%$nelsonscolumn77> Bale would have been top 5 of my generation if things had gone better at Real
[2023-01-09 18:56:07] <bandulu360> That‚Äôs 9 golds mate
[2023-01-09 18:56:08] <%+hiimsausageman> @sorarejosh suarez shits on him
[2023-01-09 18:56:08] <%$thomt96> this is such a tune
[2023-01-09 18:56:08] <tucker331> You think his EoE will be better than his 91?
[2023-01-09 18:56:08] <%+saaj003> Remember the Bale hat trick vs Inter Milan as a LB for Spurs
[2023-01-09 18:56:10] <here4rewards_> FIFA 19 TOTY SBC Bale was insane at backpost headers, what a card
[2023-01-09 18:56:14] <%+taylorallen133> Bale is the only player to score 2 champions league winning goals that alone gives him legend status imo
[2023-01-09 18:56:15] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> Nah @Viperlization no way. Salah has had much better individual seasons than Bales
[2023-01-09 18:56:16] <+Romanlamagna> His Copa del Rey goal is one of my all time favs
[2023-01-09 18:56:19] <Rubendran17> Too early for retirement tho imo. Not a long career enough to be grouped with the greats. Had a late development too.
[2023-01-09 18:56:20] <harry8497> This is a banger
[2023-01-09 18:56:20] <CardDre> Wife beater giggs was better
[2023-01-09 18:56:21] <liam_1899> Bale won a trophy every season once he left spurs. Apart from when he went on loan to spurs
[2023-01-09 18:56:23] <%$coys51> Bale is so far clear to Salah people need to watch more ball lol
[2023-01-09 18:56:23] <%+notgravityeu> Injuries will tarnish bale legacy to a degree but he's definitely top 5 British with Terry, Cole Rooney
[2023-01-09 18:56:23] <mattc9090> Not many players who had a bigger impact in the moments it mattered. All those final goals
[2023-01-09 18:56:28] <dcr05> End of era should be 95 rated
[2023-01-09 18:56:28] <%+tordgull177> it is like with Ronaldinho, he was one of the worlds best players in their peak, but the longevity holds them back
[2023-01-09 18:56:32] <%+tobywankenobi101> Remember every game would always be a bale cut in screamer to make it 1-0
[2023-01-09 18:56:33] <hitikkumar> @coys51 L take
[2023-01-09 18:56:35] <em_punk777> 171 games in 11 seasons all comps!!! some pure clowns in here think fifa ratings and onee off CL games make a player an "icon" bahahahaha
[2023-01-09 18:56:38] <$PirloNotImprsessed> Can you run ads sooner to 6 please nep
[2023-01-09 18:56:40] <%+tobywankenobi101> Him and Lennon were unstoppable
[2023-01-09 18:56:51] <@%Viperlization> @SpreadsheetFifa I disagree man. For one, Bale has a better highlight reel, more important goals I'd also argue
[2023-01-09 18:56:51] <+SchaferGX> He didn‚Äôt love the sport, he didn‚Äôt love the job, he lacked the desire because of it to push every time he stepped on the pitch
[2023-01-09 18:56:52] <+Ciesielczuk99> 10 mill for a 5 month loan seems very steep üòÖ
[2023-01-09 18:56:54] <jenguslogantwopoint0> That goal vs Liverpool was the the cherry on top of bales football career
[2023-01-09 18:56:56] <$Cheetoo13> wich time do Sorare rewards come out?
[2023-01-09 18:57:00] <Post_FUT_Clarity> Ribery got 90 with like 80 composure, pure slander

[2023-01-09 18:57:29] <%+saaj003> Bale's peak and career honours > Salah (and I'm an LFC fan) but Salah's consistency/longevity > Bale. Ability wise have to say Bale but overall it's not easy to distinguish. Bale edges it for me for what he's won and done
[2023-01-09 18:57:29] <+ragingrhino48> Do you think Bale isn‚Äôt classed as British legend because most people from the Uk only saw him in champs league, but if he played for a dominate United or Chelsea, City Liverpool Arsenal he would be hands down the greatest
[2023-01-09 18:57:29] <hitikkumar> Bale Hero card level player
