[2022-12-23 10:31:44] <%floofydragonite> Seals are easier to hunt, actually.
[2022-12-23 10:32:13] <%floofydragonite> They like to rest on the ice so if you open a spot in the ice for them to leap out of, they come up for air and rest.
[2022-12-23 10:32:19] <moonlilly666> yeah
[2022-12-23 10:32:22] <%floofydragonite> Then you wait with a gun.

[2022-12-23 10:45:14] <%floofydragonite> Moose is a really tough meat to cook, you need to sear it to lock in the juices and then braise it slowly. You could slow cook it but it becomes really bland.

[2022-12-23 10:56:53] <%floofydragonite> @Nirrri117 You want to respect Cod. Like you said it's very flaky because it's delicate. It's a very light fish so you don't want to over season. A little bit of salt, minced garlic, roasted onion and a hint of lemon zest
