[2022-12-07 17:35:16] <%tautvydas248> don't they look behind you back maybe?
[2022-12-07 17:35:16] <%BoringGenericName> Yeah UK is pretty weird
[2022-12-07 17:35:16] <%Teutonic_Tomahawk1> that is credit score

[2022-12-07 17:35:20] <%The_Yazoo> in the UK its not that bad, If you live a normal life it'll never affect you
[2022-12-07 17:35:21] <%+bagrumandtagrum> If you have a high credit score you get a better rate on a loan than you would in Germany @TommyKayLIVE
[2022-12-07 17:35:22] <@%+RonniBarker> It's somewhat good and bad... idk

[2022-12-07 17:35:26] <%shakethatassett> Its really be like china's credit score lol
[2022-12-07 17:35:29] <ArunJ0> @TommyKayLIVE its their social credit score
[2022-12-07 17:35:36] <%sirmathylos> @TommyKayLIVE we are joking about chinese social score, but we have credit scores in two of the biggest Western nations
[2022-12-07 17:35:41] <ArunJ0> like china
[2022-12-07 17:35:49] <welpserr> You cant live a good life here in America without good credit
[2022-12-07 17:35:53] <TheGreatApex> a good credit score proves u can pay things on time, vs others who might seem untrustworthy
[2022-12-07 17:35:54] <%tautvydas248> When I took mortgage, my bank checked my credit rating. I live in Lithuania
[2022-12-07 17:35:55] <%jimmy300567> different credit card also allow you to get money back on the money you spend like from 1-5% back
[2022-12-07 17:35:55] <+Darkkross123> @ShadyGerman Nobody actually knows what effects the score in detail. Having many bank accounts for example tanks your schufa
[2022-12-07 17:35:58] <@SEWl> wait so u dont pay with schnitzel and kaiserschmarrn?
[2022-12-07 17:35:58] <+bluemelonz> credit score is "data" that you pay your money back
[2022-12-07 17:36:02] <MirkoTomassoni> have you played fatum betula?
[2022-12-07 17:36:02] <%tautvydas248> we have a system for that
[2022-12-07 17:36:05] <%+leftytesti> Thats pretty much what credit is
[2022-12-07 17:36:06] <Perhana> it is not the same COPIUM
[2022-12-07 17:36:07] <%polish_gangsta> It kind of is
[2022-12-07 17:36:07] <%+TheBlueFalconer> @TommyKayLIVE theres the difference, they dont care if you can pay, they care if you make your payments on time KEKW
[2022-12-07 17:36:09] <%MapleNukem> @TommyKayLIVE they also use it to determine if you are allowed to rent an apartment or not, it's just gentrification
[2022-12-07 17:36:19] <BoristheWise> the plot twist that our countries were tyrannical all along
[2022-12-07 17:36:26] <hussinkawaldah> that why interest is haram
[2022-12-07 17:36:27] <@%+wolfpoops> credit score is the way the banks can tell if youre trustworthy
[2022-12-07 17:36:30] <%polish_gangsta> Everyone say your credit score
[2022-12-07 17:36:30] <ImBappus> Will you do a night stream today?

[2022-12-07 17:36:36] <kvassimoto> It's happening
[2022-12-07 17:36:37] <@%+RonniBarker> it just says that you can pay back on time, and your reliable, thats it
[2022-12-07 17:36:39] <%ClosetGoat> Powell
[2022-12-07 17:36:40] <heekarim> No
[2022-12-07 17:36:41] <%+yepcomeshot> you get points that you can use on stuff, i just use the credit card for big purchases and pay it off immediately. This gives me enough points over a year for a free flight somewhere for me and my partner @TommyKayLIVE
[2022-12-07 17:36:42] <shadowcompany666> @ImBappus no
[2022-12-07 17:36:42] <%diesdasgmbh> Powell

[2022-12-07 17:36:49] <Doggo_is_Lyfe> @TommyKayLIVE To be fair, before Paypal, Amazon etc. you could only order stuff with a credit card back in the days
[2022-12-07 17:36:50] <hussinkawaldah> that is why interest Haram
[2022-12-07 17:36:51] <+Ota_Kuma> that's why most of the german people are not in dept. germans hate to be in dept
[2022-12-07 17:36:53] <%+Maixaips> sup
[2022-12-07 17:37:01] <+rubenl5l> credit score is also determined by your payments on other things like mortgage payments, car lease payments, etc. It also depends if you pay on time/late
[2022-12-07 17:37:15] <%Heichou_Kuin> You still are, credit score is just another factor
[2022-12-07 17:37:15] <kvassimoto> TRUEING

[2022-12-07 17:38:10] <Clutrike> credit score is the result of poor people not paying back rich people. It makes sense, but reinforces generational poverty

[2022-12-07 17:44:59] <%GeorgeDWaterhower> @tommykaylive One Problem too, is the fact that banks are allowed to create money for loan out of thin air. They only Need to have 1% of the loan amount in bank. This is sadly used most of the time for speculation, which is really bad
[2022-12-07 17:45:03] <@%+RonniBarker> You heard of 50/40/30 system?
[2022-12-07 17:45:14] <%femboi_hans> hussinkawaldah if you want a car that costs 20k, the bank will buy it for 20k then sell it to you for 25k. that 5k is basically interest lil bro
