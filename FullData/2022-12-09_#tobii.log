[2022-12-09 12:52:33] <mostly_minerals> it looks better with big textures
[2022-12-09 12:52:43] <%ook_3D> it wont scale with embedded collisions no?

[2022-12-09 12:53:28] <%ook_3D> non embedded yeah
[2022-12-09 12:53:38] <+McMadii> Is it the icy lakes again? That was so good last year
[2022-12-09 12:53:42] <%ook_3D> fuck it

[2022-12-09 12:53:58] <Jzen__> a dam freezing? monkaMEGA
[2022-12-09 12:54:07] <+milkydeew> are you doing just pools of water or rivers and streams?
[2022-12-09 12:54:19] <%ook_3D> they will be able to
[2022-12-09 12:54:24] <Qmaster2> Dont forge tthe damn has interior too
[2022-12-09 12:54:26] <%ook_3D> since its not double faced
[2022-12-09 12:54:32] <%ook_3D> wait nvm
[2022-12-09 12:54:35] <mostly_minerals> iirc there are some high waves in the dam.
[2022-12-09 12:54:35] <%ook_3D> u used a prim
[2022-12-09 12:55:07] <%ook_3D> the snow is based on collision i think
[2022-12-09 12:55:08] VIEWERS: 954
[2022-12-09 12:55:11] <+Daz_105> I wish codewalker would attach the collision to the objects new scale
[2022-12-09 12:55:34] <+Daz_105> I know would be cool tho
[2022-12-09 12:55:54] <+Ol_Geiser> is there still the underwater entrance to the dam?
