Please don't make a big deal about it or guilt her in chat. It's really upsetting to have people complaining all day when we're just trying to have fun. She has TONS of Sims content on YouTube, and we'll play The Sims again later this week.

Suggestions are always appreciated, but do not attempt to make demands or force Kayla to do anything. There is a difference between friendly suggestions and aggressive demands. Ultimately she is the one playing the game, not you! simsieNo

[2023-01-09 22:41:14] <$emily96x> That happened one time when I went to six flags. Unexpected storm rolled through and we were drenched leaving.
[2023-01-09 22:41:14] <%Dawnie3296> Especially with the new reservation system.
[2023-01-09 22:41:20] <%magix532> it was downpouring when we went to disney springs during my trip
[2023-01-09 22:41:21] <+kennie329> when I went to disney there was one day it was super rainy and like so much of epcot was closed
[2023-01-09 22:41:23] <%+cynical_biscuit6> @kunam4086 for reference, she found Pietro on island 15 once, and then spent 2k tickets to find him again. So it's random!

[2023-01-09 22:48:09] <%+littleredbeep> the internet theory of a frozen Walt
[2023-01-09 22:48:10] <LimeyBerk> She was disrespecting Walt. Not the Disney brand tho
[2023-01-09 22:48:10] <%$lollyybee> is that the real inspiration behind disneys frozen?
[2023-01-09 22:48:10] <%kayscray> anyone remember the icarly episode lol
[2023-01-09 22:48:11] <ragssaysnotto> HES FROZEN IN DSINEY
[2023-01-09 22:48:11] <sillyorc> its funnier to think its true
[2023-01-09 22:48:13] <$birdfigs> people idolize him a weird amount hence the cryogenics myth
[2023-01-09 22:48:13] <@%+MrsTomato101814> omg we saw violet on island 20 and 25
[2023-01-09 22:48:14] <%$eleanorlovesdogs> i think there was an episode of icarly on this
[2023-01-09 22:48:16] <%+cecehill> Its the whole reason they made Frozen so that when you web search it you don't see that he's frozen
[2023-01-09 22:48:18] <%+kristastarr> Probably not, but he wanted to be I think
[2023-01-09 22:48:18] <%missrileybear> I think I read that he haunts his old apartment that he had on Main Street in Disneyland
[2023-01-09 22:48:18] <%msmadamemim> nope he was cremated
[2023-01-09 22:48:20] <@%+MrsTomato101814> is violet the new naomi
[2023-01-09 22:48:23] <%plantsy> wait that is actually so interesting
[2023-01-09 22:48:24] <%+merridybb> that sounds like such a cool class
[2023-01-09 22:48:27] <+oplepara> since simsie is hunting will she be streaming longer than normal? or will she still end around 7?
[2023-01-09 22:48:28] <%ANTHROUVAILLE> like bogs!
[2023-01-09 22:48:29] <tinyarticuno> theory: they created the movie frozen so that googling "walt disney frozen" didn't bring up results about him being frozen
[2023-01-09 22:48:32] <%$miirasaurus> i remember when u were taking that class! it sounds so interesting
[2023-01-09 22:48:33] <%little_miss_anxiety> @cecehill bestie thats actually genious lmao

[2023-01-09 22:49:09] <%$SailorScout04> There’s a theory that they made Frozen so that when you googled “Disney Frozen” that would come up instead of Walt being frozen

[2023-01-09 22:58:51] <+yarnho> It will be a consideration when/if you have kids. Sending them to that school system currently would be so not good for them.

[2023-01-09 22:59:49] <%+cynical_biscuit6> how DARE you not drop everything to move cross country
[2023-01-09 22:59:49] <%Jeais> I moved states in the past and even that's not easy
[2023-01-09 22:59:50] <%+moonpearl33> let them try

[2023-01-09 22:59:53] <%$SailorScout04> It’s not that easy to just move
[2023-01-09 22:59:55] <%Dawnie3296> People ask me the same thing about moving to California as a Canadian. My wife owned her house at the time and life was easier for me to move there.

[2023-01-09 22:59:57] <%msmadamemim> people sure make a lot of assumptions

[2023-01-09 22:59:58] <%$alxxandraa> the “why don’t you just move” argument is soooo stupid and unrealistic
[2023-01-09 23:00:01] <%+emimadi17> plus you have a house now. that's hard to leave
[2023-01-09 23:00:02] <%+EmazingEmma> even just moving states is tricky and annoying and kinda scary like moving countries is crazy
[2023-01-09 23:00:03] <%missrileybear> I literally HATE that logic… moving states is already hard enough
[2023-01-09 23:00:03] <$birdfigs> the “if you hate x just leave” is such a weird mindset. like you can see that a place has bad things and still want to stay and make it better
[2023-01-09 23:00:04] <mirandaaralyn> i want to go to college outside of florida but it really isn’t that easy. everything is set up here so i have to stay here 🥲

[2023-01-09 23:02:56] <%$mimbim4> for me it's that I've never felt at home in this country (Germany) but I have in other countries (Australia especially)
[2023-01-09 23:02:58] <%+egginawig> you gotta pay taxes to both which is annoying

[2023-01-09 23:03:10] <+lizasauruslocke27> What about moving to Animal Crossing?
[2023-01-09 23:03:12] <%$aouisee> @pencil_thief3 no its only on switch

[2023-01-09 23:03:21] <pugstar0711> animal crossing is one of my comfort games just because of how cute the game is lol
[2023-01-09 23:03:23] <+niahmatcha> Do you use an extension to count how many islands you go to or is it apart of the game?
[2023-01-09 23:03:27] <@%Little_Dica> @rabidcherry it makes sense though, cause you live your own country's problems first hand so they seem like the biggest
[2023-01-09 23:03:27] <%MagickGaymer> 10 years here I think then you test and then get citizenship
[2023-01-09 23:03:27] <@%^Moobot> simsieNo Don't yell! Tone isn't easily conveyed through text. Make suggestions, not demands! simsieNo
[2023-01-09 23:03:29] <%msmadamemim> in the US you can get citizenship by literally only being born there, even if you're parents aren't apparently. Or so I've heard.
[2023-01-09 23:03:29] <%FruityCrows> More complicated than that
[2023-01-09 23:03:30] <itsmesimlie> Yeah here in Canada it takes 7 years until you can even test for your citizenship
[2023-01-09 23:03:31] <pencil_thief3> @pencil_thief3 oh ok ty!
[2023-01-09 23:03:33] <+yanjii> Even after you get married it takes a few years
[2023-01-09 23:03:33] <+xemily330> I want to move to Scotland but it’s probably not going to happen
[2023-01-09 23:03:34] <%heatherlouise_> I used to work for UK immigration but I left literally 3 months before covid and omg I can’t imagine how stressful I would have been working there during the pandemic
[2023-01-09 23:03:34] <%Dawnie3296> They stopped that in the 70's.

[2023-01-09 23:07:40] <moniquesylvie> I have a list of places in the us that seem very american to me that I want to go to unreasonably badly. the cheesecake factory is on that list
[2023-01-09 23:07:41] <%42hitch42> most restaurants with fountain machines will refill for free. If it's canned or bottled, they won't
[2023-01-09 23:07:44] <%$samanthaverb> It's nice but I'm a slow eater/drinker so I always end up with several cups at my place simsieCry
[2023-01-09 23:07:44] <%+lxhvli> i’ve barely been in the uk for 5 years and i’m only now getting my citizenship!
[2023-01-09 23:07:46] <%+simply_kayla> i don’t think we do that here except for with water

[2023-01-09 23:08:16] <notthefamoushandedowen> don't most european countries have soda taxes that stand in the way of free refills?
[2023-01-09 23:08:17] <lmicp> @alicexaw usually they remember what you ordered, or they ask you.
[2023-01-09 23:08:18] <%plantsy> ah yes the diner coffee warmup is an essential part of the experience
[2023-01-09 23:08:19] <%$seafoampudding_> cheesecake factory goes hard fr

[2023-01-09 23:09:01] <%+sagethemfherbb> the four cheese pasta is so gooood
[2023-01-09 23:09:02] <%$samanthaverb> I feel like big portion sizes are a pretty standard US thing though

[2023-01-09 23:09:41] <%+sarenebee> It’s like one salad
[2023-01-09 23:09:42] <aprilkaitlyn> The Thai tacos are vegan and so good
[2023-01-09 23:09:43] <dorinamoonc> i wish i had the money and go to the USA and try all these fun things i see in films or series, even on social media
[2023-01-09 23:09:43] <%Dawnie3296> I love that hesitation.
[2023-01-09 23:09:44] <%CatherineElena> I always look at the menu and decide before I go because it is so long
[2023-01-09 23:09:44] <+xemily330> How does vegan cheese cake even work
[2023-01-09 23:09:45] <%missrileybear> They try so hard to be fancy and not look like an expensive tacky chain restaurant
[2023-01-09 23:09:45] <%+Dennis_Nas> Wait is it more than just cheesecakes
[2023-01-09 23:09:45] <%ARomanticAce> their key lime cheesecake was so tasty the last time i had it, lol. but it def wasn't vegan.
[2023-01-09 23:09:46] <bloxita11> Does cheescake have cheese in it?
[2023-01-09 23:09:46] <%+littleredbeep> as a canada resident, cheesecake factory as always piqued my interest

[2023-01-09 23:09:48] <%+sarenebee> Salad that has no flavor
[2023-01-09 23:09:50] <%kayscray> theres an extent to where a place even having vegan options is super exciting
[2023-01-09 23:09:50] <FrozenCelestine> what villagers have we found yet?
[2023-01-09 23:09:53] <helixspirals> Water is a great vegan option at the Cheesecake Factory
[2023-01-09 23:09:54] <%folieadom> i wouldn't say they have good food, i only go for the cheesecake
[2023-01-09 23:09:54] <$NessieIsNotACat> lots of cheese dishes obviously

[2023-01-09 23:11:37] <%+logicalaaalex> In Europe there are lots of bound menus with lots of pages but there will be like 3 items per page
[2023-01-09 23:11:37] <whatelleplays> If you go to a big chain maybe but it is not normal
[2023-01-09 23:11:37] <%$mistikfic> the length is normal. but the Cheesecake Factory ones are absurdly tall and physically large
[2023-01-09 23:11:37] <%SpoilerCat> i get overwhelmed if theres more then 3 pages

[2023-01-09 23:11:41] <%CatherineElena> menus in europe were that long but they had pictures taking up the page so it made sense
[2023-01-09 23:11:41] <%Necrodancers> HOW DO THEY LOOK OTHERWISE?????

[2023-01-09 23:11:43] <%+JustCallMeNerdy> None of them menus in europe I had were more than two sides of one page
[2023-01-09 23:11:43] <%+bootsgravy> as a citizen of Europe, I have never seen a menu with more than maybe 6 pages

[2023-01-09 23:11:49] <%$morgan_lefay> I was in German and served a pre-fixe menu at every restaurant I went to
[2023-01-09 23:11:49] <masterofduckies> its common in Europe but to be fair there's usually like 50 different hot dogs
[2023-01-09 23:11:50] <+yanjii> idk in europe its like usually at least 10 pages
[2023-01-09 23:11:50] <@%Little_Dica> THAT IS WAY TOO MUCH CHOICE

[2023-01-09 23:11:56] <brynn777> i would get so overwhelmed
[2023-01-09 23:11:56] <feministcheesecake> WHAT
[2023-01-09 23:11:56] <kingfreya> hello```????
[2023-01-09 23:11:56] <%+simply_kayla> no i’ve been there once, it really is abnormally long
[2023-01-09 23:11:56] <%+zomb_bree> MORE THAN
[2023-01-09 23:11:57] <%+ellemayaa> Compare it to a normal restaurant here
[2023-01-09 23:11:57] <eeveelock> I have never seen that other than at a sushi restaraunt where every sushi is a seperate option
[2023-01-09 23:11:57] <%+josierosieposie> average german restaurant
[2023-01-09 23:11:57] <%rabidFairy> LITERALLY HOW
[2023-01-09 23:11:57] <veja1> it's not like super common but some restaurants do have very long menu in Europe
[2023-01-09 23:11:58] <simparker> It’s common to have a bound menu with maybe 4 pages. Not that many pages
[2023-01-09 23:11:58] <%shannoniigans> well not that many dishes, but book menus like that are common in europe
[2023-01-09 23:11:59] <%FruityCrows> Bigger words and pictures, maybe the same amount of pages
[2023-01-09 23:11:59] <%+claraaas> but no pictures, pictures seems cheap haha
[2023-01-09 23:11:59] <jaasminemarie> Honestly the UK is like this it has an insane amount of pages because everything has an option
[2023-01-09 23:11:59] <%+crossims3112> 250??? wow
[2023-01-09 23:11:59] <gigi_redd> LMAO
[2023-01-09 23:11:59] <%ARomanticAce> the only place i've seen with a similarly jam-packed menu is a 3 Margaritas simsieLOL
[2023-01-09 23:12:00] <%lizzylion572> Because the cheese cake factory food is frozen for real
[2023-01-09 23:12:00] <@%Little_Dica> European menus are NOT this long
[2023-01-09 23:12:00] <%+alexmitchellgonzalez1> most places around me have no more than 20
[2023-01-09 23:12:00] <%catieohjoy> Now that I think of it, when I went to a German restaurant in Boston they did have a huge menu too
[2023-01-09 23:12:01] <%+iiimogen> i love cheesecake factory sm but i get so overwhelmed by the menu LUL
[2023-01-09 23:12:01] <%$Theresevers> im too indecisive...
[2023-01-09 23:12:01] <$KlaytonCrow> joyailGasp
[2023-01-09 23:12:01] <%$lisa71670> That is way too many to choose  lol
[2023-01-09 23:12:01] <%Jeais> I've seen slightly longer menus only when there are long wine menus
[2023-01-09 23:12:02] <%$jastewgood> INSANE
[2023-01-09 23:12:03] <%greyscrow> oh my
[2023-01-09 23:12:04] <chlobunny28> yea I always forget about how long their menu is, I usually just flip to a random page and pick something
[2023-01-09 23:12:04] <%+cloudberrytart> that's about 240 too many
[2023-01-09 23:12:04] <%ncstone> if there's more than 3 pages in a menu, the food will NOT be fresh, it'll mostly be frozen
[2023-01-09 23:12:04] <MoonlightBunnies> 21 on my fav restaurant
[2023-01-09 23:12:05] <$pastelcat22> having a bound book menu is normal but 21 pages isn't
[2023-01-09 23:12:05] <%CatherineElena> there's like 3 pages of just cheesecake flavors it's crazy
[2023-01-09 23:12:05] <+kelberg11> I used to serve at Cheesecake Factory. When you get hired, you have a week long orientation and have to take a test on all of the menu items, must know all dishes inside and out
[2023-01-09 23:12:05] <%$alxxandraa> i have too much decision fatigue for that
[2023-01-09 23:12:05] <OrganicCannedMonster95> How is that possible?
[2023-01-09 23:12:06] <%+see_a_mess47> normal is like 20 items in the us
[2023-01-09 23:12:06] <%pearachu> where in Europe?? like what
[2023-01-09 23:12:07] <%MagickGaymer> Gordon Ramsey would say thats insane...with profanity
[2023-01-09 23:12:08] <%FrogTux_> I WOULD NEVER BE ABLE TO CHOOSEEE
[2023-01-09 23:12:08] <@%^Moobot> I didn't post on Instagram today but i need likes on past photos to feed my fragile ego so pls like and follow https://www.instagram.com/lilsimsie/
[2023-01-09 23:12:08] <rachelcb123> in the US typically we think smaller menus mean fresher food as opposed to huge menus of microwaved food
[2023-01-09 23:12:09] <%+aly_longlegs> in europe Wine list maybe but not food
[2023-01-09 23:12:09] <$KlaytonCrow> That’s wayyy to much
[2023-01-09 23:12:09] <crazygrape3> depends where you go
[2023-01-09 23:12:09] <%andscottie> I think what is weird to me (as an American) is that it has Asian, Italian, Mexican, etc.,.like way too many cuisines
[2023-01-09 23:12:09] <+jade_alexis> How do you even decide?
[2023-01-09 23:12:11] <+FxckinJudi> Any place that has that many options doesn't do any ONE thing well.
[2023-01-09 23:12:11] <%+cynical_biscuit6> most places have like 3-4 pages in my experience
[2023-01-09 23:12:11] <%+sophielovescoffeeanddogs> its a difference between it just being a book, thats normal in europe, but with pictures and bigger font and stuff
[2023-01-09 23:12:11] <sleepylxmon_> 250!?
[2023-01-09 23:12:12] <+FloralSkiesTV> Not to mention all the cheesecake options!
[2023-01-09 23:12:12] <%+crossims3112> I would never decide what to eat
[2023-01-09 23:12:13] <helixspirals> Also, Europe is a whole continent filled with dozens of countries. Idk why they always act like it’s a monolith
[2023-01-09 23:12:14] <%madisyn59> i’ve been twice and i don’t even remember that many at cheesecake
[2023-01-09 23:12:15] <%emcaffeine> maybe not 21 pages but about 10 its quite common
[2023-01-09 23:12:15] <janaesisler> that's so many options
[2023-01-09 23:12:15] <%Dawnie3296> Me either.
[2023-01-09 23:12:16] <HolyTrashpandas> Are they all foods? Half of the long menus are usually drinks here
[2023-01-09 23:12:16] <%+sophielovescoffeeanddogs> for sure not 250 options
[2023-01-09 23:12:16] <moniquesylvie> do they have a randomize option
[2023-01-09 23:12:16] <+xemily330> That is too much for me
[2023-01-09 23:12:17] <anc1102> SIMSIE COULD U PLZ SONG ME HAPPY BDAY
[2023-01-09 23:12:17] <%FruityCrows> Never ever had that
[2023-01-09 23:12:17] <@%Little_Dica> I AM USED TO ONE PAGE MENUS 😭
[2023-01-09 23:12:18] <%lizzylion572> It is all frozen lmao
[2023-01-09 23:12:19] <summerrose08> thats just accesive
[2023-01-09 23:12:19] <%$jenniferlundqvist> I mean maybe 10 with the drinking list
[2023-01-09 23:12:20] <MoonlightBunnies> I don't know about items <3
[2023-01-09 23:12:20] <%ARomanticAce> imagine being the chef at one of these restaurants and having to do ALL THOSE DISHES
[2023-01-09 23:12:21] <tove_b> what europe are y'all living in, this is not normal in all of europe
[2023-01-09 23:12:21] <%pearachu> ok having a bunch of wines is way different
[2023-01-09 23:12:21] <%$miirasaurus> this is an intense discussion the chat is going so fast
[2023-01-09 23:12:22] <janaesisler> no wonder I get anxious there
[2023-01-09 23:12:22] <lilangie91> usually.. the bigger the menu, the quality of the food goes down
[2023-01-09 23:12:23] <%shannoniigans> it is
[2023-01-09 23:12:23] <@%+MrsTomato101814> @kelberg11 ive heard that from other past cheesecake factory employees!
[2023-01-09 23:12:24] <odecamile> how do they not lose money
[2023-01-09 23:12:24] <%indigomoons> yep
[2023-01-09 23:12:24] <emerald_em22> The place I work has 2 pages of mains and 1 page of sides
[2023-01-09 23:12:24] <pugstar0711> Where in Europe 😭
[2023-01-09 23:12:25] <AmethystWyvernZephyr> lol
[2023-01-09 23:12:26] <%Necrodancers> i'm so shocked how do they live like that in the US ;_;
[2023-01-09 23:12:26] <%+JustCallMeNerdy> Its absolutely not normal
[2023-01-09 23:12:27] <%+iiimogen> they have the massive menu in dubai cheesecake factory!!
[2023-01-09 23:12:27] <moskas1> i would feel so overwhelmed
[2023-01-09 23:12:27] <%+sticksig> How can they be expected to be able to cook everything on there?!
[2023-01-09 23:12:28] <tibbs_dibbs> the design is normal in europe, but there are usually 6-10 pages, including drinks.
[2023-01-09 23:12:28] <+Saichen> i need a d&d roll chart to eat there
[2023-01-09 23:12:29] <veja1> I'd literally read a menu before coming to restaurant if it had so many pages
[2023-01-09 23:12:30] <%GreenPanda_ee> never played animal crossing, can you send away your first villagers, or do you have to keep them?
[2023-01-09 23:12:31] <%lizzylion572> @Little_Dica Me too fam haha
[2023-01-09 23:12:32] <%viciousvillians98> Hello everyone!
[2023-01-09 23:12:32] <%alicexaw> longest ive ever had in europe its been like 5 pages and it was a fancy place
[2023-01-09 23:12:32] <tinyarticuno> and to think. the one time i went to the cheesecake factory on holiday i only ordered a singular slice of cheesecake
[2023-01-09 23:12:32] <kajsa02> standard in europe is maybe 8-12 depending on their cuisine
[2023-01-09 23:12:32] <elenapaz02> in Spain is normal
[2023-01-09 23:12:33] <%+claraaas> thats  a lot
[2023-01-09 23:12:34] <%paulina_smiles> go to a jersey diner and cheesecake factory will seem short
[2023-01-09 23:12:35] <+yanjii> Honestly, I prefer when restaurants have shorter menu, at least I know its better quality than those 500 dishes that they microwave
[2023-01-09 23:12:35] <%msmadamemim> it's normal for it to be a book
[2023-01-09 23:12:35] <%shannoniigans> Germany
[2023-01-09 23:12:35] <%$writtenrain> only like 24 hour diners are like that
[2023-01-09 23:12:35] <%+dia12> i used to have to enter menus online for my job, and more than a couple pages is crazy to me lol
[2023-01-09 23:12:35] <%+Dinis_Lourenco> Never seen that
[2023-01-09 23:12:36] <cyclingcyborg> germany
[2023-01-09 23:12:36] <%indigomoons> in slovenia this is common
[2023-01-09 23:12:36] <%$userlameuserlame> i'm used to like 5 options lmao

[2023-01-09 23:12:39] <knox_ing> Poland!
[2023-01-09 23:12:39] <Iva_Berg> A restaurant having a million pages is a huge red flag 🚩🚩🚩🚩
[2023-01-09 23:12:39] <$sarahluvs> but like it doesnt even have pictures its a straight list of a ton of different dishes
[2023-01-09 23:12:40] <$gay_soda> i've been to restaurants like that, and they were bad
[2023-01-09 23:12:40] <sasusch> germany

[2023-01-09 23:12:41] <rubieluna> Im shocked
[2023-01-09 23:12:41] <+lizasauruslocke27> Pictures or it Did Not Happen lol
[2023-01-09 23:12:43] <%+kitty_cat9234> its kinda common to get resturants in the UK that have 10 or so but 21 is insane
[2023-01-09 23:12:46] <knitterjulia> UK
[2023-01-09 23:12:46] <%$snowyNika> i think they are talking about the look, like the bound menus not the amount of the menu
[2023-01-09 23:12:46] <%$forthehopeofitall> ive seen it in some places in germany and austria
[2023-01-09 23:12:46] <%Mylokahh> Hungary
[2023-01-09 23:12:46] <sleepylxmon_> you would never get bored of what to eat x)
[2023-01-09 23:12:46] <+i7_pow2908> in aus they have anywhere from 2 to 8 pages

[2023-01-09 23:12:48] <MiaMys306> any restaurant in canada, fancy places are 1 or 2 pages. regular place are 4 to 6 pages
[2023-01-09 23:12:48] <%laursmurp> To be fair in European countries with those menus are only long because they put the many in multiple languages
[2023-01-09 23:12:50] <%andscottie> the better the restaurant, the shorter the menu
[2023-01-09 23:12:51] <%+brittishchick> yeah as a chef I gotta tell you anything more than 50 menu items is too many

[2023-01-09 23:12:59] <chickenpox_CLOUT> DEFINITELY NOT A BOOK
[2023-01-09 23:13:01] <@%Little_Dica> The only place where you'd get a lot of choice here in italy is a pizza place, cause you get a lot of topping choice
[2023-01-09 23:13:01] <$pastelcat22> yes
[2023-01-09 23:13:03] <%+MaeMay101> watch kitchen nightmares and youll never want to eat at a restaurant again
[2023-01-09 23:13:03] <%Amanda_LWood> Went out to eat yesterday and was literally just front and back.. that’s pretty normal
[2023-01-09 23:13:04] <LauraPetrea> In Denmark it’s normal
[2023-01-09 23:13:05] <kajsa02> @artsyEmma right! here theyre like 3 pages or so
[2023-01-09 23:13:05] <+yanjii> In Poland books like that are normal lol

[2023-01-09 23:13:07] <+KeebyMoon> well in germany most places have extra pages for drinks, soups, main courses etc.. each like 5-10 things
[2023-01-09 23:13:07] <%$seafoampudding_> i feel like menus in the us are like 2-4
[2023-01-09 23:13:08] <notthefamoushandedowen> i feel like most restuarants are bi-fold with maybe an insert or extra mini fold
[2023-01-09 23:13:09] <PoweredByEvil> Cafe 63, which is a chain in Australia has 63 items.
[2023-01-09 23:13:11] <%Jeais> @paulina_smiles No way 21 pages is still way longer I've lived in NJ all my life
[2023-01-09 23:13:12] <%+kristastarr> Yeah folded, not a book lol
[2023-01-09 23:13:12] <%$greendragon1997> in the uk a lot of menus are bound but they only have like 5 pages

[2023-01-09 23:13:15] <%plantsy> i feel like most menus are only one page with a wine list on the back

[2023-01-09 23:13:15] <%+erincatherine7> 1 Page menus are the best bc it usually means they focus on a few amazing dishes
[2023-01-09 23:13:16] <HolyTrashpandas> The bound book style is normal in Europe, yes
[2023-01-09 23:13:16] <moskas1> LIKE THAT YESS
[2023-01-09 23:13:16] <%Mylokahh> @Vexiie_ Omg hello hungarian frieng
[2023-01-09 23:13:17] <waywardsymer> 0
[2023-01-09 23:13:17] <%+faoncat> the length maybe is normal but not the amount of menu items
[2023-01-09 23:13:17] <phil_spear03> It’s normal to be a book but the book is 4-12 pages long
[2023-01-09 23:13:18] <%CatherineElena> i always go online beforehand so i know what i want when i arrive lol
[2023-01-09 23:13:18] <%$mimbim4> they have like 50 options for drinks and around 30 for food. on about 20 pages in a booklet
[2023-01-09 23:13:18] <%+marissa1113> a trifold
[2023-01-09 23:13:19] <%+heckaziza> ive seen bounded menus like that a million times but never that length yaknow
[2023-01-09 23:13:19] <%marija_withaj> the Balkan area in Europe it is at least 20 pgs but they have lots of pictures and bigger font
[2023-01-09 23:13:20] <pugstar0711> In every restaurant ive been to its been like that
[2023-01-09 23:13:20] <%+sagethemfherbb> i feel like 3-5 is normal in the US
[2023-01-09 23:13:20] <%+abilliboss> Nicer restaurants will have a bound book like menu, but not nearly as many dishes
[2023-01-09 23:13:21] <%$casserolee4> same
[2023-01-09 23:13:21] <%missrileybear> This has me looking at their menu on DoorDash to see how long it is
[2023-01-09 23:13:21] <%$therobinwing> the folded things are common in cafes over here, but the proper restaurants have the cheescake format
[2023-01-09 23:13:22] <%+kenned1e> non-chain menus often have a booklet menu with lamination and rings in the uK
[2023-01-09 23:13:22] <Hersonat> yes like that!
[2023-01-09 23:13:24] <loverworm> like a folder
[2023-01-09 23:13:26] <diogothedodo> where I´m from most books have like 10 pages
[2023-01-09 23:13:26] <veja1> no we have all types of menus
[2023-01-09 23:13:28] <%+juliabrigatte> I think that in america you can add stuff on your meal, in brazil every adittion has its own plate on the menu, so its very long, like rice with beans, then rice with white beans then with red beans
[2023-01-09 23:13:29] <%artsyEmma> @kajsa02 yeah exactly, maybe 5 at most
[2023-01-09 23:13:29] <%42hitch42> apparently the average chain restaurant menu was 132 items in 2018
[2023-01-09 23:13:29] <%+emi_glitterbook> trifold menus are pretty common too
[2023-01-09 23:13:30] <%ARomanticAce> yeah, "long" menus in the US are like...4 pages, double-sided print so there's 8 pages total
[2023-01-09 23:13:30] <lovisalanden> Sweden has menus like that… sometimes even binders
[2023-01-09 23:13:30] <Ummagumma_player> thats the most normal thing
[2023-01-09 23:13:31] <@%Little_Dica> Yep same
[2023-01-09 23:13:31] <%+cynical_biscuit6> I think they don't know the difference between a menu and a NOVEL
[2023-01-09 23:13:31] <%sunflowerben> I've never seen that large of a menu in Holland or Ireland, but that's all the places I've been in Europe
[2023-01-09 23:13:31] <%little_miss_anxiety> yeah thats what im used to
[2023-01-09 23:13:33] <%+sagethemfherbb> yes. exactly

[2023-01-09 23:13:33] <+hayleywilliams42> now im hungry
[2023-01-09 23:13:33] <%$onthenerdyside> maybe 8 total
[2023-01-09 23:13:33] <%$alxxandraa> the normal ones have pictures that are most of the page. cheesecake factory is all words
[2023-01-09 23:13:33] <%lizzylion572> Normal is like a few pages not a book like
[2023-01-09 23:13:33] <lmicp> why are we having menu discourse rn
[2023-01-09 23:13:35] <samikaysays> also the amount of text vs pictures
[2023-01-09 23:13:35] <sobatheshibe> yea no cheesecake factory is abnormal
[2023-01-09 23:13:36] <stealing_honey> This whole time I thought we were talking about noodles and company
[2023-01-09 23:13:36] <%$pinkkatlady> In Germany big menus are definitely common. Especially in Asian restaurants
[2023-01-09 23:13:37] <%FruityCrows> That's how they look here
[2023-01-09 23:13:37] <%+fully_caffeinated> Or a separate drink menu
[2023-01-09 23:13:37] <MaritaBighome> Yes, bound books are normal in Europe.
[2023-01-09 23:13:39] <crazygrape3> WHATTT???
[2023-01-09 23:13:39] <knitterjulia> UK page or two of starters, page for each meat, chicken, fish and vegetarian, one or two pages for desserts then drinks
[2023-01-09 23:13:40] <%viciousvillians98> maybe an extra page or two
[2023-01-09 23:13:41] <mihabubble> thats like for apetizers at cafes, even
[2023-01-09 23:13:41] <%karuti11> that would even be a tiny menu for like a street kebab stand oop
[2023-01-09 23:13:41] <%jocantcodebinary> Some restaurants have some really fancy leather covers and it’s not even uncommon here
[2023-01-09 23:13:41] <$pastelcat22> book menus are around allt there even at pizza places
[2023-01-09 23:13:41] <%$rinibeeny> 11 PAGES YOU GUYS
[2023-01-09 23:13:43] <%+claraaas> books are normal
[2023-01-09 23:13:43] <%$mimbim4> Germany has books
[2023-01-09 23:13:45] <%+kristastarr> Most I’ve seen is like 6
[2023-01-09 23:13:45] <%LostAsrai> 6-10 pages, maybe. In that binding style. But def not 21 pages of menu. And if they are that much, usually the restaurant isn't that good
[2023-01-09 23:13:46] <laur_asf> In Lithuania it is common that meniu has 20-40 pages :D
[2023-01-09 23:13:46] <+Saichen> we have a local chain that has a book, but it's still not that long lol
[2023-01-09 23:13:46] <@%Little_Dica> Okay cheesecake factory is on my bucketlist
[2023-01-09 23:13:46] <+fishie333> that depends how fancy restaurant is tbh
[2023-01-09 23:13:47] <+lmr66> Books are at fancy restaurants
[2023-01-09 23:13:48] <%GreenPanda_ee> never played animal crossing, can you send away your first villagers, or do you have to keep them?
[2023-01-09 23:13:49] <kajsa02> @artsyEmma yesss i realized three might be to little lol but like not many more

[2023-01-09 23:13:57] <msmiscellaneous> Most menus are less than 10 pages with like 5 to 10 per page

[2023-01-09 23:13:58] <aniisaurus> 10 pages on average
[2023-01-09 23:13:58] <+lizasauruslocke27> Maybe they mean they hav spiral bond menus not the amount

[2023-01-09 23:14:30] <%ARomanticAce> i'd say the average US restaurant probably serves 20-50 different dishes, not counting differences in serving size (like a kid's menu serving of chicken tenders vs the adult's menu serving would be just one dish, practically speaking)
[2023-01-09 23:14:30] BAN: LauraPetrea
[2023-01-09 23:14:31] <%laursmurp> 5 pages are English then 5 are French Spanish etc etc
[2023-01-09 23:14:32] <chipchrome_> they dont get it
[2023-01-09 23:14:34] <victoria2992> In nyc it is common for long menus like this at diners!
[2023-01-09 23:14:34] <MaritaBighome> There is a lot of pages with wine!
[2023-01-09 23:14:34] <sammireads> some of yall are lying for attention i think
[2023-01-09 23:14:34] <+xemily330> She’s so upset about this
[2023-01-09 23:14:34] <Vexiie_> maybe the menus aren't that long but menus definitely look like that. maybe 50 dishes are normal.
[2023-01-09 23:14:34] <$gay_soda> that's so funny ahahah
[2023-01-09 23:14:34] <PoweredByEvil> By the time you finish the book, the kitchen has closed :D
[2023-01-09 23:14:35] <%CatherineElena> and cheesecake factory near here is always out of half of the menu no matter when you go
[2023-01-09 23:14:36] <crazygrape3> average in the UK is around 15 pages
[2023-01-09 23:14:36] <your_local_vampire> where I live it's usually 6 pages long lol
[2023-01-09 23:14:36] <tibbs_dibbs> in europe its normal to have 6-10 pages, including drinks, wines and spirits. At propper restaurants at least

[2023-01-09 23:14:41] <%+theartofeveryday> Greek diners tend to have a large bound or spiral but probably not more than 10-15 pages when you factor in breakfast, lunch, dinner, drinks, etc.
[2023-01-09 23:14:43] <sobatheshibe> dont listen to them kayla
[2023-01-09 23:14:43] <+fishie333> cheap restaurants have more positions usually, fancier have smaller selection but it rotates

[2023-01-09 23:14:47] <%pearachu> yeah just the dishes, having a big book of wines and other drinks is totally different
[2023-01-09 23:14:48] <%ARomanticAce> that is just the cheesecake
[2023-01-09 23:14:48] <%viciousvillians98> I'm so glad I joined stream right now lol
[2023-01-09 23:14:48] <hol_hanna> the restaurant in my town has a 17 page long menu but only like 40-50 dishes
[2023-01-09 23:14:49] <pugstar0711> omg
[2023-01-09 23:14:50] <hajen_bajen> like 5 pages at max
[2023-01-09 23:14:51] <Ummagumma_player> omg thats too many cheesecakes
[2023-01-09 23:14:51] <KariOliver> The Guinness world record for the largest menu consists of 1810 different items achieved by the restaurant Mofarguru in Budapest, Hungary
[2023-01-09 23:14:53] <+lizasauruslocke27> Show someone flipping
[2023-01-09 23:14:54] <@%Little_Dica> THERE IS NO WAY THOSE ARE FRESHLY MADE
[2023-01-09 23:14:54] <%$userlameuserlame> sheesh
[2023-01-09 23:14:55] <akhigh10> can you pull up the actual menu on stream or is that copyright?
[2023-01-09 23:14:55] <%$alxxandraa> ITS ALL WORDS. that’s the difference
[2023-01-09 23:14:55] <%karuti11> a local restaurant where i live has (and this is nont much) 50 (main) dishes plus deserts and drinks of course
[2023-01-09 23:14:56] <%+sticksig> At this point I think chat is just doing this to mess with you Kayla lol
[2023-01-09 23:14:56] <kaytast> paradise
[2023-01-09 23:14:56] <%$alaurel17> and this isnt even the drink menu
[2023-01-09 23:14:58] <sobatheshibe> i live in europe and has been to multiple countries and theres nothing like that
[2023-01-09 23:14:58] <lucytheangel1> I think it’s more about how many items are on the manu and less about how long the book is
[2023-01-09 23:14:58] <kajsa02> thats ridiculous almost
[2023-01-09 23:14:58] <helixspirals> So y’all mean to tell me that every single country in Europe has that? From Portugal to Russia and everything in between?
[2023-01-09 23:14:59] <lucie_doo> Okay ours are more spaced out
[2023-01-09 23:15:00] <+FxckinJudi> @lilsimsie I think you need to Live Stream from a Cheesecake Factory and explain to the people with real life examples
[2023-01-09 23:15:01] <%+dixiwarriorash> I’m from the US and never been to the Cheesecake Factory and I have never seen a menu that long ever, most I’ve seen is like 4 lmao
[2023-01-09 23:15:02] <HolyTrashpandas> We have a lot of pages but they’re not all food and way bigger letters
[2023-01-09 23:15:02] <%Jeais> If I was contracted to redesign the cheesecake factory menu I'd quit
[2023-01-09 23:15:02] <%$doughri> I went to a tea place with 8 pages of tea
[2023-01-09 23:15:03] <Hersonat> Lotta cheesecake

[2023-01-09 23:15:03] <%$mazzgarcia91> what about showing the website? won't that have the menu on it?
[2023-01-09 23:15:04] <%+juliabrigatte> in brazil every little adittion has its own place on the menu, like an item for french fries, another with fries and cheese etc
[2023-01-09 23:15:04] <%+ashlynbeth> Never did I think that a simsie stream would just be fighting over a cheese cake menu
[2023-01-09 23:15:05] <jadeeee_727> Cheesecake galore omh
[2023-01-09 23:15:05] <brookepersephone> I feel like In the US at say a restaurant maybe 7-10 pages tops and that’s including drinks all types of meals and pictures
[2023-01-09 23:15:06] <pugstar0711> Thats ALOT of cheesecake

[2023-01-09 23:17:53] <%dwagonsndinos> pizza restaurants around me usually have around like 200 items on their menu

[2023-01-09 23:18:36] <sobatheshibe> i didnt experience that in germany and ive been there plenty of times
[2023-01-09 23:18:38] <%+Dennis_Nas> Berlin does not have cheesecake factory style menus 💀💀💀
[2023-01-09 23:18:39] <%karuti11> the average street food stand in nuremberg has like 10 optionss alone for bratwurst in bread

[2023-01-09 23:18:39] <%+emmaplaysgames_> oh when I was in Berlin we had a set menu for a work dinner and it was still like 5 pages just for food. it was alarming lol
[2023-01-09 23:18:40] <kajsa02> the drink menus in europe are loooong
[2023-01-09 23:18:41] <+kallistoverse> chat straight up gaslighting u 😭
[2023-01-09 23:18:42] <%$casserolee4> most places will always have more drinks then food
[2023-01-09 23:18:42] <sasusch> in germany the menus are long and definitely books. but the pages aren't that full
[2023-01-09 23:18:42] <elkanashin> And if their menu is long in Germany it means they have like hundreds different beverage xD
[2023-01-09 23:18:42] <@%+MrsTomato101814> yeah take off the beer menu and then count again, germany
[2023-01-09 23:18:42] <rachelcb123> maybe the German menus are long because their words are so long! that doesn't count!!
[2023-01-09 23:18:44] <+Smilinsteph83> i feel like i have arrived at the wrong moment
[2023-01-09 23:18:44] <%$alaurel17> in us drinks are often their own menu so that is not included in the page total
[2023-01-09 23:18:45] <%$jastewgood> that's what I was thinking they were referring to the whole time smh
[2023-01-09 23:18:46] <allison> thats too many options for me hahah

[2023-01-09 23:21:27] <+fishie333> but its a foodchain still
[2023-01-09 23:21:27] <@%^Moobot> simsieNo Don't yell! Tone isn't easily conveyed through text. Make suggestions, not demands! simsieNo
[2023-01-09 23:21:28] <tibbs_dibbs> This is the most standard of menus ever in germany, please stop confusing simsie: ***
[2023-01-09 23:21:30] <%ARomanticAce> the fancier the restaurant, the shorter the menu, but the longer the wine list froogyNodders
[2023-01-09 23:21:32] <%walkthemoo> hiiii
[2023-01-09 23:21:32] <%forthenerd> Expensive =/= fancy to be fair
[2023-01-09 23:21:32] <%$rinibeeny> the NICER the place the smaller the menu, the more options the worse they are
[2023-01-09 23:21:34] <%andscottie> no that's right.
[2023-01-09 23:21:35] <sithlord1313> have you ever considered playing Spiritfarer? I recently finished the game and I'm honestly obsessed.
[2023-01-09 23:21:35] <%$samanthaverb> really? I feel like it's the opposite
[2023-01-09 23:21:37] <%$miirasaurus> the fancier the restaurant the less likely there will be something i like on the menu
[2023-01-09 23:21:38] <%ncstone> the longer the menu, the less fresh the food is
[2023-01-09 23:21:38] <%+daizeerb> hi snappy

[2023-01-09 23:21:41] <a_elsi> Large menus are generally a sign of poorly done food
[2023-01-09 23:21:41] <$NessieIsNotACat> snobby resturants have like 2 options
[2023-01-09 23:21:42] <%peachytorii> simsieAye simsieAye
[2023-01-09 23:21:42] <%bealines> i would say the smaller the menu the bougier the restaurant
[2023-01-09 23:21:43] <%north_cub> when i was younger i thought cheesecake factory was just from icarly
[2023-01-09 23:21:43] <stan_txt_> i want to go to cheesecake factory BibleThump
[2023-01-09 23:21:43] <%$casserolee4> SNAP
[2023-01-09 23:21:44] <%+bookworm95687> You can't make 250 dishes and do a good job on most of them, lol
[2023-01-09 23:21:44] <%$forthehopeofitall> touristy places in Italy always have bigger menus, if you want GOOD food you need to go to a place with a smaller menu
[2023-01-09 23:21:45] <%little_miss_anxiety> if a restaurant has like 5 dishes then you know its gonna be priceu
[2023-01-09 23:21:47] <%plantsy> good, fresh produce that isn't flown in from somewhere else is so expensive
[2023-01-09 23:21:48] <+lilbirdiii> does it count if the restaurant has a different menu for breakfast lunch and dinner?
[2023-01-09 23:21:49] <%little_miss_anxiety> I LOVE THAT SHOW

[2023-01-09 23:21:56] <%$snowyNika> less choice is higher quality since they can focus only on a couple dishes
[2023-01-09 23:21:57] <%$samanthaverb> although my definition of fancy is Olive Garden
[2023-01-09 23:21:57] <%+ellemayaa> There’s a lot of places with like 5 things on the menu
[2023-01-09 23:21:58] <%$lollyybee> lilramsey
[2023-01-09 23:21:58] <%$histephanie> My favorite restaurant has a one page menu
[2023-01-09 23:21:59] <@%+MrsTomato101814> the chefs actually cook the food from scratch instead of reheating in a microwave
[2023-01-09 23:22:00] <%+kristastarr> Yes lol
[2023-01-09 23:22:01] <+lmr66> Quality over quantity
[2023-01-09 23:22:01] <+fishie333> but they are changing small menus like every month or so

[2023-01-09 23:22:14] <%ARomanticAce> yes, every time, and everyone is shocked that it's unreasonable to expect a chef to prepare 97 different menu options fresh to order, lol
[2023-01-09 23:22:14] <holmskii> i would love to watch gordon ramsay tear apart the cheesecake factory
