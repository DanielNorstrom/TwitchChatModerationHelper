[2023-01-02 15:44:16] <%DeNarm> insects have another problem though: they don't have bones and the chitin shell can only keep so much together. it doesn't support the whole weigth eventually and could crack easily. so they can't get super thick, like beatles, but they could get longer like dragonflies.

[2023-01-02 16:00:12] <%titterr> when you have enough attack speed, start putting meadows next to your rivers

[2023-01-02 16:58:08] <%+GaimeGuy> @fight_this Fucking love that dopamine that's some good shit man FeelsAmazingMan
[2023-01-02 16:58:11] <%+Krymzon19> makes me think of Super Mario Land 1
[2023-01-02 16:58:13] <%fight_this> this is gradius adjacent
[2023-01-02 16:58:16] <%+floppie7th> This is a Mario themed shmup
[2023-01-02 16:58:19] <%+Krymzon19> The submarine level
[2023-01-02 16:58:24] <eniak0km> have you played Bangai-0 on Dreamcast?
[2023-01-02 16:58:24] <Heygids> didn't super mario land have a flying level?
[2023-01-02 16:58:27] <%xqcpat> are you thrill for the wo long release ? Seems to have a lot of potentiel.
[2023-01-02 16:58:28] <%+CaliggyJack> As a Shmup fan, I want to play this hack right now
[2023-01-02 16:58:31] <%+JHammon67> You should ask Turkey or Dog rules for mashing tips
[2023-01-02 16:58:34] <%fight_this> @GaimeGuy FeelsDankMan
[2023-01-02 16:58:34] <%+Sorry4HavingFun> in my experience barb tends to like games that are just games
[2023-01-02 16:58:43] <%TimebreakerLucas> there has been a lot of spiritual successors recently. like wild arms devs working on armed fantasia and shadow hearts devs working on penny blood. love to see it
[2023-01-02 16:58:50] <%Kilram> Super Mario Land vibes
[2023-01-02 16:58:52] <%fight_this> you wouldnt believe the shit people who likes shmups deal with
[2023-01-02 16:58:55] <%+GaimeGuy> I heard that "As a schmuck fan"
[2023-01-02 16:58:55] <%olegplaygame> i allways compare hammerwatch to vempaire survaivor due to how they  look and play
[2023-01-02 16:58:55] <%fight_this> that shit looks impossible
[2023-01-02 16:58:56] <%Qu_Marsh> @TimebreakerLucas yeah I'm excited about those!
[2023-01-02 16:58:57] <%$RBPimlico> yes it was
[2023-01-02 16:59:02] <voicesinthesky> sure was
[2023-01-02 16:59:04] <%Balivor> What's shmup?
[2023-01-02 16:59:05] <%GnuHope> early early early late. classic
[2023-01-02 16:59:08] <%+GaimeGuy> Shoot em up
[2023-01-02 16:59:12] <%Balivor> ahhh, thanks
[2023-01-02 16:59:13] <%+Docmorales24> Frieza did it
[2023-01-02 16:59:13] <%$CrunchyManjitou> shmup
[2023-01-02 16:59:17] <%+Docmorales24> Diddy did it
[2023-01-02 16:59:26] <+MarMar0326> Im not sure I’ve seen a game with quite the divided opinion as Vampire Survivors. For a lot of people, it just really clicked, and they made it one of their GOTYs. For people it didn’t click with, they got bored real fast.
[2023-01-02 16:59:28] <%$VinceAyne> Raystorm for PS1 was a blast
[2023-01-02 16:59:29] <%+GaimeGuy> Or you can just replace shmup in your head with "schmuck" and make it hilarious
[2023-01-02 16:59:34] <%+CaliggyJack> I have wet dreams about a potential Gradius 6
[2023-01-02 16:59:39] <KOOLSM0KE> this seems like something you'd find in mm2 LUL
[2023-01-02 16:59:47] <eniak0km> theres also bullet hell category..
[2023-01-02 16:59:52] <%KnusperBKN> The idea is cool, but too hard for a unique gimmick, that no one has ever seen.

[2023-01-02 16:59:58] <%Almar_AZL9S> SHMUPS usually designated as HARD
[2023-01-02 16:59:59] <$onvars> I think a major issue with making mario into a schmup is that schmups normally have zero momentum in their movement, which isn't how mario usually controls
[2023-01-02 17:00:02] <%+Zaiz_En> I think Shmups have been corrupted by the shitty mobile versions .
[2023-01-02 17:00:04] <%+CTG64> Morning Barb! Happy New Year Man. barb7  barbOK
[2023-01-02 17:00:05] <%+Docmorales24> it gets boring. there comes a point where nothing can touch you
[2023-01-02 17:00:07] <%$GooferG> have you played rimWorld? :P
[2023-01-02 17:00:12] <%RedRustRiot> Yeah, Vampire Survives was fun for like 5 hours for me, but I totally get how some folks sunk a lot more
[2023-01-02 17:00:14] <%Almar_AZL9S> barbHi everyone
[2023-01-02 17:00:20] <%+GaimeGuy> you would probably like Brotato
[2023-01-02 17:00:26] <%fight_this> vampire survivors is probably an excellent mobile though
[2023-01-02 17:00:27] <%smoulder1> the most fun games are the ones where you have tangible improvement
[2023-01-02 17:00:29] <%firecrotch007> Wants depth plays Mario

[2023-01-02 17:00:51] <%HCPnator> I got to a point in a Vampire survivor game that i couldnt die anymore. Went AFK for 30 minutes and i was still alive.
[2023-01-02 17:00:59] <%+mav87333> VS is a gatway game. My wife got into it and 3 months later is kiling Sigrun LUL
[2023-01-02 17:01:02] <%thejumpingmouse> I kept going back to Vampire survivors because I want to keep my 100% status on the game
[2023-01-02 17:01:04] <%smoulder1> hades is quickly becoming one of my favorite games ever tbh

[2023-01-02 17:01:18] <%+Sorry4HavingFun> my daughter loves Vampire Survivors because of all the colours and effects
[2023-01-02 17:01:19] <%+judephoen1x> I may have put more time into Hades than I put into Elden Ring, and I loved Elden Ring
[2023-01-02 17:01:21] <%LemonStir> @HCPnator Try to make it 32 minutes then
[2023-01-02 17:01:23] <PlasticAutomaton> how long is this section oh god
[2023-01-02 17:01:31] <%+CaliggyJack> I like games like Vampire Survivors and Jump King, cuz I can relax and just do the same thing over and over again. It's like that South Park episode with Heroin Hero.
[2023-01-02 17:01:32] <%+GaimeGuy> Vampire Survivors is essentially casual Smash TV

[2023-01-02 19:16:11] <%betooth> SOTN and the two GBA Castlevania's are awesome games

[2023-01-02 19:16:13] <Angenga> i play sotn randomizer a lot, depends on the settings but honestly its easier than oot rando
[2023-01-02 19:16:22] <%theBonestorm> Love the SOTN playthrough, I've watched it a few times on YT barbCheers
[2023-01-02 19:16:25] <%Ancient_Book_Wyrm> depends, you can get lucky and get an OP weapon right at the beginning LUL

[2023-01-02 19:16:26] <%Unkey_Phil> It's pretty easy, lots of enemies just drop the best weapons early and you can speed through the early game.

[2023-01-02 20:21:29] <%schmattywinkle> you fuckin with 1899 at all?

[2023-01-02 20:21:41] <%mort459> my 71 year old father refuses to watch any modern dramas without subtitles. I tihnk he has a point
[2023-01-02 20:21:42] <%Vinzi11a> Subtitles as baseline
[2023-01-02 20:21:45] <%OneForTheMoney123> bro the guy can play a drug cartle guy and a smuggler in Andor

[2023-01-02 20:21:51] <%+Saephon> 1883 > 1899
[2023-01-02 20:21:51] <%+Sorry4HavingFun> i feel like we're in a writer drought. All the shows coming out have shit plot, shit characters, shit lines. I think production companies are pouring all their money into visuals and not the actual content
[2023-01-02 20:21:53] <%$FishFlavoredCoffee> as an AuDHD subtitles are mandatory
[2023-01-02 20:21:54] <%$VinceAyne> yeah 1899 was meh

[2023-01-02 20:22:06] <%OneForTheMoney123> DARK onthe other hand
[2023-01-02 20:22:06] <%$JustMoreZowee> Severance is one of the best of the year
[2023-01-02 20:22:07] <%Valandril__> did you use subtitles for GoT?
[2023-01-02 20:22:09] <thelummie> Watching Nolan films with subtitles is almost essential at this point

[2023-01-02 20:22:22] <%$g4m8i7> We just watched West Wing and didn’t need subtitles. Every new show requires them. It’s infuriating
[2023-01-02 20:22:25] <BryanBeretta> Not even by a master baiter?
[2023-01-02 20:22:25] <Kahawamoto> Is severance the apple tv one?
[2023-01-02 20:22:26] <%+DunlapJones> fits in with rogue one
[2023-01-02 20:22:33] <%$VinceAyne> The character development in 1899 made like no sense. So many characters went from not knowing or hating eachother to best friends for no fucking reason
[2023-01-02 20:22:34] <%$razovega> andor is trash

[2023-01-02 20:22:39] <%destructo__spin> Severance was the best show of last year
[2023-01-02 20:22:41] <%TheRealSpaded> I thought Kenobi was awesome.
[2023-01-02 20:22:45] <%SkeptikalKlown> It takes the setting seriously in a way that hasn't been done since the OT
[2023-01-02 20:22:47] <%+Rozzy15> For All Manking on apple tv is also verh good
[2023-01-02 20:22:49] <laserdude17> andor makes you forget that mandalorian is as good as it is

[2023-01-02 20:23:24] <%$crizotibin> I just binged andor and I don't regret it, it's really good. The best things Star Wars has done in a long time
[2023-01-02 20:23:25] <%$crittrTV> Severance is great. Kinda feels like LOST with some SCP vibes
[2023-01-02 20:23:29] <%siricx91> Season 1 and 2 of the boys was great but season 3 was really bad imo.

[2023-01-02 20:23:30] <%$Senverti> book of bobba was surprisingly bad, especially since they had been essentially doing a bobba show with mandalorian already

[2023-01-02 20:24:19] <%CarbonAxiom> @Monknut85 Pretty much every interview I've heard from directors imply they're doing it on purpose. It's something like "these are high quality productions that should be seen in theaters, but even though they're never going to be shows in them we're still making the shows as if they were"

[2023-01-02 20:51:26] <%Electrolith> I remember when Joe Sakic stuck his hand in his snowblower and mangled it. What kind of Canadian does that?
[2023-01-02 20:51:31] <%Martin_Lutter> caryisnaked it respawns. also, get dressed.
[2023-01-02 20:51:44] <KarraChr000> “As of now, we can confirm Jeremy is in critical but stable condition with injuries suffered after experiencing a weather related accident while plowing snow earlier today,”
[2023-01-02 20:51:48] <%xannyboy420> ok
[2023-01-02 20:51:49] <cyclones1989> he got ran over by his snowcat i heard
[2023-01-02 20:51:49] <%+caryisnaked> Did you see Violent Night and did you enjoy playing Santa?
[2023-01-02 20:51:56] <+lockethief11> snow plow injury implied to me a car accident
[2023-01-02 20:51:56] <%KnusperBKN> that section could only be worse with apearing and disapearing boos

[2023-01-02 20:52:22] <%+airhornsurprise> The home alone traps were fun
[2023-01-02 20:52:27] <KarraChr000> @lockethief11 Except, from the way the article reads, Jeremy was the one plowing...
[2023-01-02 20:52:29] <%umbra00> have you ever seen tucker and dale vs evil?
[2023-01-02 20:52:33] <%DonkeyMintInc> I like David Harbour, whole rest of the movie was dumb AF
[2023-01-02 20:52:33] <%RuskiComie> the boys are cool, and overall there's just so much ideas in independent comics for movie industry to develop, but all we get is another reboot barbGabnon

[2023-01-02 20:53:47] <%CarbonAxiom> @RuskiComie I wish comic books would actually make stories that aren't about superheros. There are a lot of good ideas out there that are being limited by the fact that they  need to be superheroes of some sort
[2023-01-02 20:53:52] <%probablyiflames> PauseChamp
[2023-01-02 20:53:52] <%DonkeyMintInc> Violent Night either needed to be harder and more fun, or take itself more seriously.
