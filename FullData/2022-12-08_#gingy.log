[2022-12-08 15:44:27] <LeonaNightsky> So it's a perspective bug on the guard
[2022-12-08 15:44:38] <wallofcrys> bug report
[2022-12-08 15:44:51] <%EffinNipples> @pbosh the repair UI will tell you "Repair will take out 3.3 to 5.4 points of max durability" so if your armor is 98/100 but it removes 3.3 max then you end up with less total durability than if you didn't repair because it will repair to 96.7

[2022-12-08 19:55:20] <MihoiSzaun> @darkstxr45 Even better is to just jump into raids on your PMC, fear nothing, play like it's CoD and you'll get the hang of it eventually. Also having someone knowledgeable to help/teach you.
