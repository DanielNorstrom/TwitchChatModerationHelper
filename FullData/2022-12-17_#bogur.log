[2022-12-17 13:16:08] <%slackanishu> @NicoVibes true, we do plan to reduce the cooldown on hog self heal by half, impossible to interrupt it, add 25% to his movement speed and boost long range dmg to equal closest range (not sure to which distance yet), happy hogging from all of us at blizz balance team.
[2022-12-17 13:16:15] <%katmosk> can they complete change hog design or do they have to keep hook?
