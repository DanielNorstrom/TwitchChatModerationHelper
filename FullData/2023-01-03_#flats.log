[2023-01-03 00:00:04] <MythiccMage> @tarnschnitzel, It was that in the right meta, with no lucio, and if the moon turns red and a stars align she would be good or something
[2023-01-03 00:00:08] <NaveThaShade> if DMG drops then Tank DMG would be superior
[2023-01-03 00:00:08] <cweber9> Nap is F tier
[2023-01-03 00:00:08] <%+Chunko_Muffo> The should let Brig jetpack in any direction and not just bash forward

[2023-01-03 00:00:23] <Arkham_Stein> @flats how much would it fuck up the game if some of the supports could deal a little more weapon damage?  or would it change it  much?

[2023-01-03 00:02:15] <+thekingissalty> they could have reworked the double shield prob without going 5v5
[2023-01-03 00:02:15] <TrueKingKBS> Anyone got tips? Im a gold 3 lucio / zen main who didnt play OW and came in late to OW2 from a bunch of other games and Id like to play tank but dont know who to start on
[2023-01-03 00:02:17] <Swiftcal> supports are great I just want more choices!
[2023-01-03 00:02:18] <cweber9> But nobody was playing half a year ago?
[2023-01-03 00:02:24] <ChronoAura> Joats meta didn't exist in OW2. It only existed in OWL.

[2023-01-03 00:02:29] <%$xepicryan> IMO support is only 'not fun' because it relies too heavily on teammates. You have good teammates you have a great time on support
[2023-01-03 00:02:31] <+5Picoseconds> Why does DPS need a passive?
[2023-01-03 00:02:34] <sir_kil_alott> @bangbrothers LUL LUL LUL
[2023-01-03 00:02:35] <spruceaddict> @TrueKingKBS just play who you actually enjoy
[2023-01-03 00:02:35] <%clever_corvid> Do you think the support passive has any merit, or is a terrible band aid?

[2023-01-03 00:02:39] <%ThatOtakuInTheCorner> Remove tank passive so I can boop people off the edge more as lucio
[2023-01-03 00:02:40] <+Insanityis> @BANGBROTHERS 2 people actually
[2023-01-03 00:02:42] <AlarmRefined> Not being able to properly boop tanks is annoying
[2023-01-03 00:02:43] <+Rey_Rey_Aria> Bap has a good kit but idk what tier. High to mid
[2023-01-03 00:02:44] <%SpaceCircus_> DONT forget the MAJORITY is now NEW F2P players in silver and bellow (aka new plat)
[2023-01-03 00:02:46] <Sunnysunshiner> dps do no dmg in low rank

[2023-01-03 00:02:56] <He_Is_Man> the moment flex queue isn't just support queue we will know support is in a good place
[2023-01-03 00:02:57] <o_soar> @clever_corvid self healing is important af
[2023-01-03 00:02:57] <Luzarrow> there's 0 variety when playing support
[2023-01-03 00:03:00] <ChronoAura> @ChronoAura Yeah. The beta. Not after launch day.

[2023-01-03 00:03:08] <+ivan9917> for half of that time people were just in denial that support had a problem tho, and just claimed that people were complaining for not getting "new toys"
[2023-01-03 00:03:09] <+5Picoseconds> if anything supports need small reworks. Not buffs.

[2023-01-03 00:03:27] <Subzerosnowice> bastion getting booped farther then baby dva cause tank passive scjSnore
[2023-01-03 00:03:28] <steankyboy1228> maybe add a cooldown to discord and make it last like 5 secs but if u kill enemy it resets and buff his healing a bit. maybe 2 healing orbs.
[2023-01-03 00:03:30] <Verona_violet> I enjoy just listening to Flats and Emongg  chat about OW very informative

[2023-01-03 00:03:45] <Cissco> Arcade needs role lock
[2023-01-03 00:03:48] <%+Dagron2331> I don't think support needs a large buff but I think they need more ui recognized stats like amount healed or higher potg chance.
[2023-01-03 00:03:48] <steankyboy1228> Hog is a mini team on hgis own
[2023-01-03 00:03:52] <awfulamir> But he is broken

[2023-01-03 00:05:03] <ChronoAura> burst healing

[2023-01-03 00:05:11] <%+benjiionps> i main bap hes so fun and good
[2023-01-03 00:05:12] <%swinblo> bap and mercy :c
[2023-01-03 00:05:16] <squirtlehermit> bap is so fun to play
[2023-01-03 00:05:17] <spruceaddict> bap damage is crazy
[2023-01-03 00:05:17] <%SleepyBear_18> his shift
[2023-01-03 00:05:17] <%Ari0n0s> The regeneration shift heal is crazy
[2023-01-03 00:05:18] <+PARG0NX> @flats thoughts on abilities like Suzu and lamp?, i think support need to be something other than  heal bots. Lucio feels like the best created support
[2023-01-03 00:05:18] <pk_silver_> 10 burst
[2023-01-03 00:05:21] <+ijamistic2> 100
[2023-01-03 00:05:21] <KeatonWasTaken> AOE heal is pretty dope
[2023-01-03 00:05:21] <+Zylach> Bap is great but is overshadowed by Kiriko in almost every way which is why you don't see Bap very often. He's extremely good but you don't have an incentive to pick him when Kiriko is required.
[2023-01-03 00:05:21] <ChronoAura> The AOE heal insta-heals, now.
[2023-01-03 00:05:23] <Pennlocke> GIGACHAD
[2023-01-03 00:05:27] <%+Quizzystyle> does it still have the instant heal on it?

[2023-01-03 00:05:38] <Two_For_Twenty> honeslty for sojourn make her rail charge half a second slower in ult make her rail do 150 a headshot and revert her drop off and sojourn is still really good but not so opressive that you can't do anything against it
[2023-01-03 00:05:38] <BlitzVolfe> The 100 instant burst under half is crazy
[2023-01-03 00:05:41] <NaveThaShade> good to save a group amount of teammates
[2023-01-03 00:05:41] <%+Chunko_Muffo> it does a pretty good amount

[2023-01-03 00:07:00] <spruceaddict> @Splosh0 the nerfs
[2023-01-03 00:07:02] <%$xepicryan> Bap is so similar to Kirkos utility if she ever gets nerfed I think Bap becomes meta
[2023-01-03 00:07:06] <j3rryyyyyy_> you should do ult tier lists
[2023-01-03 00:07:07] <+Mikazukix1> @Ari0n0s I've had Baps that save ult for the entire game. It's so sad.
[2023-01-03 00:07:07] <+mercym0mmymilker69> has reallllly good dmg
[2023-01-03 00:07:10] <%clever_corvid> My favorite thing to do with Bap is throw my immortality field at the other team by mistake and then swear under my breath.
[2023-01-03 00:07:12] <KeatonWasTaken> I also really think his jump helps a lot in getting safe highground too
[2023-01-03 00:07:14] <MythiccMage> Bap is like the sigma of the heals, just rock solid
[2023-01-03 00:07:19] <spruceaddict> @j3rryyyyyy_ that would be fun
[2023-01-03 00:07:19] <+Rey_Rey_Aria> Solid hero

[2023-01-03 00:07:26] <phatpolarbear> Bap main here, high A
[2023-01-03 00:07:28] <Two_For_Twenty> I went into an lfg and I had a guy who mained dps but was playing support and was topping every single game with dps on bap
[2023-01-03 00:07:28] <NaveThaShade> Moira probably C tier
[2023-01-03 00:07:28] <Splosh0> They gotta revert the punch back to 3 seconds then he’ll be fine

[2023-01-03 00:15:45] <+dsmit130> As a control experiment, would it make sense to have every hero at their strongest, and create a “hardcore competitive mode” that allows top 500 grouping. Would this allow everyone to utilize the strengths of each character when they were most broken?

[2023-01-03 01:29:29] <%JerryTarantinoo> casual play has been a breathe of fresh air tbh
[2023-01-03 01:29:30] <ItalianSquid> torb hammer 5v5 comp
[2023-01-03 01:29:34] <ShaderkaUSA> my last comp was season 8 in OW1
[2023-01-03 01:29:38] <%uncleduges45> comp is not fun
[2023-01-03 01:29:41] <MrShenaniman> @adamthewillie In OW 1, GM had a 350 SR spread allowed, so a GM1 likely can't group with GM5, as an example.
[2023-01-03 01:29:42] <+Markolab> I feel like it's between casual and comp
[2023-01-03 01:29:42] <%mchsraider> I play QP until my dailies are done
[2023-01-03 01:29:44] <%+Quizzystyle> if they add a 15 min ban to leavers in quickplay quickplay is king
[2023-01-03 01:29:55] <!%Mushu> i heard comp is absolutely broken yeah

[2023-01-03 01:30:07] <cozmicastroz> i only playcomp to have a chance to be in spectating bronzes but then again i am poor
[2023-01-03 01:30:08] <lzimmlive> I mean honestly, the only reason I’m doing comp is for my weeklies.
[2023-01-03 01:30:14] <%oedipus_flex> how do i not suck which of flats videos playlists
[2023-01-03 01:30:15] <wolfypie1123> Why aren’t you rank 1?
[2023-01-03 01:30:15] <adamthewillie> fair enough
[2023-01-03 01:30:15] <MrPotato_6> my teammates are bad in qp
[2023-01-03 01:30:16] <Tenth_Shadow> yep as long your top 500 GM
[2023-01-03 01:30:18] <Jazziph> I like your personality on videos, that's what made me follow you
[2023-01-03 01:30:19] <+tylive52> i had someone in ranked the other day said "stfu im just trying this hero my first time"...i HATE DIAMOND
[2023-01-03 01:30:23] <%blueberrybench> @adamthewillie because you have to be between 50 sr between quing
[2023-01-03 01:30:26] <KingCaprese> I got Cyberdemon season 1, now I'm just doing daily challenges and I'm having more fun

[2023-01-03 01:30:52] <%paleassnowx> mystery heros is way more fun than ranked
[2023-01-03 01:30:57] <%mataveztiaz> have you ever been a pro player for overwatch ?
[2023-01-03 01:30:58] <talon824> Hihi Flats Hihi chat, how are games today? Many Hog abusers?
[2023-01-03 01:30:59] <the5thhokageee> as an ow1 character comp is so boring and frustrating that i play ranked in small doses.
[2023-01-03 01:31:04] <ChronoAura> Top 1 doesn't hold any weight/value, like it used to.
[2023-01-03 01:31:05] <TheE_ManGamer> I personally know Leovyn
[2023-01-03 01:31:06] <!%Mushu> YES?
[2023-01-03 01:31:08] <crazed2k> I think rank isn’t fun because it’s not as satisfying having to win 7 before seeing a change
[2023-01-03 01:31:10] <!%Mushu> alright bet
[2023-01-03 01:31:10] <%chisycroissant> Comp sucks rn

[2023-01-03 01:31:26] <Bexypie> doesn't matter comp or qp
[2023-01-03 01:31:26] <Gregwolf007> @Flats basically you just enjoy the game for what it is which is a bit of both comp and QP
[2023-01-03 01:31:29] <@%AwCrap> peepoReallyHappy
[2023-01-03 01:31:31] <FragSpam> u should start doing sub lobbies @Flats that would be a vibe
