[2023-01-07 02:13:53] <%+Spo_0n> Tarkov is a tetris game with a shooter bolted on. I only raid to get more tetris pieces for the real game.

[2023-01-07 02:15:08] <$yawndere> It depends on the game, some games in 21"9 are the same "width" as 16:9 but but squished down
[2023-01-07 02:15:09] <%KuroKamuy> we can hear it

[2023-01-07 02:19:47] <VarVarith> Fun thing that if RPG will ever appear in Tarkov, the shell will be too big to fit in any rig in a game at 5 or 4 tiles long. The launcher would have same lengh, but maybe one tile wider
[2023-01-07 02:20:05] <summerwhiskey> I have so much loot I constantly commit insurance fraud just to make space in my stash

[2023-01-07 04:34:48] <Amaterasudragon> to be fair, “based” doesn’t have much use anyways because of the supposed definition it has.

[2023-01-07 04:41:54] <VarVarith> @taterpictures Precept Fifty-Five: 'Bow to No-one'. There are those in this world who would impose their will on others. They claim ownership over your food, your land, your body, and even your thoughts! They have done nothing to earn these things. Never bow to them, and make sure to disobey their commands.

[2023-01-07 08:24:37] <LeoSiegfried> UK is 16
[2023-01-07 08:24:38] <+mrlockets> legal age doesnt mean that it aint creepy

[2023-01-07 08:25:33] <Baziwan88> its a fine line between okay and wood chipper

[2023-01-07 08:27:24] <%Rappolt> I don't think the people saying 17 is okay are thinking with their top brain
[2023-01-07 08:27:37] <%Rappolt> Or are over 22 themselves
[2023-01-07 08:28:00] <%PhantomLazarz> Isnt the legal age in Japan 13 tho sleepyproCringe2
[2023-01-07 08:28:01] <%cookierobotgames> i remember someone said half your age + 7 is a decent general rule for a min dating age
[2023-01-07 08:28:01] <%Rappolt> "I kicked her out of the store" lol
[2023-01-07 08:28:05] <k0mbatw0mbat432> realistically whats the difference between 17 and 18 really

[2023-01-07 08:28:47] <%hanzomo> how old is eepy? sleepyproSmug2
[2023-01-07 08:28:52] <GarmrUSAF> there is FAR less difference between 17-18 and 17-38
[2023-01-07 08:28:53] <+Twismyer> @PhantomLazarz I think there is no province where the legal age is under 16 at least.
[2023-01-07 08:28:57] <%Rappolt> The point is you don't want huge gaps in mental maturity
[2023-01-07 08:29:02] <%+greasyy__> @cookierobotgames yeah, i remember a general rule being ur age - 3 at most, which then in younger ages does not apply
[2023-01-07 08:29:07] <k0mbatw0mbat432> its totally arbitrary for the purpose of making laws
[2023-01-07 08:29:16] <+Twismyer> A hard line has to be drawn somewhere
[2023-01-07 08:29:23] <%Order_of_Dusk> Yeah there's a big difference between 17 and someone in their 30s, it is not comparable to a relationship between a 17 yo and 18 yo
[2023-01-07 08:29:37] <justaproudpatriot> scavs can open those

[2023-01-07 17:26:22] <VarVarith> Nikke is when the big round ass.
[2023-01-07 17:26:29] <+porkrollterrier> nikke is also insanely expensive to play. F2P absolutely blows.
[2023-01-07 17:27:02] <%+AngelofWrath13> @l3thalsp00n  OOF! That's horrible! I bet Spectrum won't compensate the customer.
[2023-01-07 17:27:18] <+porkrollterrier> Funny enough, Genshin is probably the cheapest gacha to play. and it's also the highest quality one BY FAR.

[2023-01-07 17:27:42] <%l3thalsp00n> @Two_Chimes weirdly since last week weve been getting lots of peer to peer intrusion alerts thru IPV6 address's thankfully the firewall did its job but we went ahead and disabled ipv6 on the network until we investigate the source IP
[2023-01-07 17:27:44] <+porkrollterrier> Genshin isn't just a glorified mobile clicker game, which is nice
[2023-01-07 17:27:44] <%chutche> I've been hearing a lot of people complain about audio issues and like footsteps sounding like they're coming from other floors when they're right next to you, have you been experiencing that?

[2023-01-07 17:55:57] <ambientficus> Their early work was a little too new wave for my taste. But when Sports came out in '83, I think they really came into their own, commercially and artistically. The whole album has a clear, crisp sound, and a new sheen of consummate professionalism that really gives the songs a big boost. He's been compared to Elvis Costello, but I think Huey has a far more bitter, cynical sense of humor.
