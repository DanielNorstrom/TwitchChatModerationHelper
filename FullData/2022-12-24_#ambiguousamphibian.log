[2022-12-24 21:18:23] <bocchi003> for the HDMI addon you need to be knowledgable (???) in modding like physically

[2022-12-24 21:18:44] <lego_pat1993> Ah i was in the horde
[2022-12-24 21:18:53] <hingedgooch> it's really really grindy, more fun with friends. I played a classic cracked server before blizzard released it
[2022-12-24 21:18:57] <%Ass_bear> just use spiffs Infinite Like Exploit Kappa
[2022-12-24 21:19:10] <%korrin_arren> @evilflame he didn't record that stream I don't think
[2022-12-24 21:19:12] <Kruise_Kontrol> Have you thought about videos on the "Planet" games like Planet Zoo?
[2022-12-24 21:19:46] <PlaceboPlaceBro> it's time to pay children.
[2022-12-24 21:19:56] <Some_Kitty_Cat> @bocchi003 nah it just is a thing you slot into the default video out that translates into hdmi without any delay

[2022-12-24 21:20:18] <LSDxHOSTILE> really unfortunate 90% of this game needs the DLC, base game is so bare
[2022-12-24 21:20:32] <evilflame> Darn. Ty though! @korrin_arren
[2022-12-24 21:20:42] <bocchi003> @Some_Kitty_Cat oh i see it's different from the SNES HDMI mod
[2022-12-24 21:20:42] <+nslbjeffrey> @LSDxHOSTILE torrent it
[2022-12-24 21:20:47] <%+Harqinz> this roundabout layout though. it looks so satisfying.
[2022-12-24 21:20:48] <%Ass_bear> @LSDxHOSTILE really? i heavily disagree, i see the DLC more as supporting the devs
[2022-12-24 21:20:58] <%korrin_arren> @lsdxhostile Paradox games tend to be like that sadly
[2022-12-24 21:20:59] <PlaceboPlaceBro> you're doing great I think the 0% tax makes up for the other stuff
[2022-12-24 21:21:03] <suburbanson> Maybe they need a 1.7 trillion check from the goverment
[2022-12-24 21:21:16] <suburbanson> I would live here
[2022-12-24 21:21:16] <%Ass_bear> all of the base mechanics of the DLC get implemented into the base game, and theres an infinity of content on the workshop
[2022-12-24 21:21:29] <%korrin_arren> that is nice that they do that
[2022-12-24 21:21:41] <sadfish616> Love the way you speak
[2022-12-24 21:21:48] <+nslbjeffrey> @Ass_bear deffinitly not theres not as much content at all in vanilla then with dlcs
[2022-12-24 21:21:53] <LSDxHOSTILE> @korrin_arren yup, glad CK3 isnt too bad though or realy at all for that matter LUL

[2022-12-24 21:24:36] <suburbanson> police started as Pinkertons which was a private security force that became the police in local areas.

[2022-12-24 21:27:13] <+LightningSamTwitch> spiff had around 50 toll booths i think
[2022-12-24 21:27:14] <StayHydratedBoy> there are clowns and lots of fun

[2022-12-24 21:30:32] <bocchi003> do americans have the little gates that communicate with a little device on your car that charges you money every time you go under them? like around 30 cents and up to pass, they're regular on highways here
[2022-12-24 21:30:54] <bocchi003> you do not stop to pay you just pass under them at any speed
[2022-12-24 21:31:06] <+LightningSamTwitch> @bocchi003 some do but there also an option to pay with normal cash
[2022-12-24 21:31:14] <+Sgt_Doughnut> @bocchi003 we have a version of that normally its named something like fast pass.  we don't have a lot of toll roads though
[2022-12-24 21:31:15] <StayHydratedBoy> we have "EZ-Pass" here but it's not along the road, it's at the beginning and end of a toll road
