[2022-12-17 17:08:57] <%smurfingsmurfer> give elemental the sorc treatment
[2022-12-17 17:08:59] <%652TRET> boon 10 mana
[2022-12-17 17:09:00] <randomlorplayer> elemental is the problem clearly, radiant to 3
[2022-12-17 17:09:02] <peledziukas1234> remove it
[2022-12-17 17:09:02] <@%^StreamElements> You can check out Waterdrop here : https://go.waterdrop.com/FenoHS-WDDAYS
[2022-12-17 17:09:03] <r1sk4fun> Boon is okay
[2022-12-17 17:09:05] <babyyshaark_> make boon a minion YEP
[2022-12-17 17:09:07] <%HyperionHS> radiant to 3 mana seems the obvious nerf
[2022-12-17 17:09:11] <+gdiii333> Nerf Guff of course. KEKW
[2022-12-17 17:09:12] <+bluedevilblue> Lady is the problem.
[2022-12-17 17:09:12] <rngesushss> radiant to 4
[2022-12-17 17:09:18] <Entely> Do you think it's fine if someone doesn't really leaves his house at the weekends? I really don't feel going out anywhere in the past 3 months. Not sure if it's just that I enjoy myself more at home or it's kinda like a starting serious mental issue or idk. Sadge
[2022-12-17 17:09:22] <!reqvam> yeah it's either boon AND valishj, or only radiant to 4

[2022-12-17 17:09:30] <%652TRET> feno we simply nerf brann and bless preist dies

[2022-12-17 17:09:39] <randomlorplayer> YEP kill it
[2022-12-17 17:09:41] <Mutalak23> if sorcerer went to 4 then radiant should too

[2022-12-17 17:09:56] <BadPlayersAreBad> kill it
[2022-12-17 17:09:57] <%willwait428> Radiant is used in the other otk deck

[2022-12-17 17:10:02] <Monty_Hall> nerf lady so i get a fat dust refund EZ
[2022-12-17 17:10:04] <bitbangboom> the new animate card bringing back radiant is a problem

[2022-12-17 17:10:06] <%Ludik79> +1 mana on lady might be calme down their giga swing turn
[2022-12-17 17:10:06] <+hoagie117> vashj lets the deck get the monster minions like 1-2 turns earlier which is huge, making it 1 mana stops that
[2022-12-17 17:10:14] <OBGrumpyy> It had its time ... Its time to go

[2022-12-17 17:10:45] <chrisvel89> Switcheroo to 4

[2022-12-17 17:10:53] <%Ludik79> @FenoHS what about the 3/2 naga who draw?
[2022-12-17 17:10:56] <monoxide___> draw a minion, put a minion in ur hand into the deck, a literal switcheroo Kappa

[2022-12-17 17:33:53] <Radaton> sketchy information to draw 3 mana minion?

[2022-12-17 17:33:53] <%b0n3d4ddy> can we just nerf priest ?
[2022-12-17 17:33:54] <%HyperionHS> they will never do a good patch
[2022-12-17 17:33:55] <%cejayyce> But blizzard likes to nuke the cards from the orbit
[2022-12-17 17:33:55] <+bluedevilblue> They don't need to nerf to destroy, just tune it down a bit.

[2022-12-17 17:34:11] <guotung96lol> any increase in mana technically destroy the deck
[2022-12-17 17:34:15] <cidarpunch> Nerf draka
[2022-12-17 17:34:25] <cidarpunch> Or graveyard
[2022-12-17 17:34:33] <bitbangboom> I wont be surprised they do rog like they did warrior

[2022-12-17 17:34:39] <Divvix> seems like big nerf
[2022-12-17 17:34:42] <%cizuss> what about nerfing illusionist to add a 4 mana 4/4 copy instead of one that costs 4 less
[2022-12-17 17:34:44] <%TJSCOUSER_> putricide to 4
[2022-12-17 17:34:54] <Thendes> draka weapon can't attack face? 5Head
[2022-12-17 17:35:04] <+bluedevilblue> I wonder if they will just nerf the location for miracle rogue.

[2022-12-17 17:35:31] VIEWERS: 780
[2022-12-17 17:35:34] <+bluedevilblue> They are going to nerf unleash fel.  I think it goes to 2.
[2022-12-17 17:35:49] <guotung96lol> nerf relic of dimension to 7 mana KEKW
[2022-12-17 17:35:59] <cidarpunch> Manathirst of unleash fel might get pushed back too
[2022-12-17 17:36:06] <guotung96lol> nerf trade discount
[2022-12-17 17:36:10] <gymmaxxing> relic vault to 3 and unleash fel to 2 imo
[2022-12-17 17:36:11] <%HyperionHS> this deck is otk dh it kills on T7

[2022-12-17 17:36:18] <%NakazatoJL> spell damage is the problem tbh
[2022-12-17 17:36:21] <+bluedevilblue> Quest Demon Hunter most broken deck
[2022-12-17 17:36:21] <bitbangboom> unleash fel should target all minion nots just enemies
[2022-12-17 17:36:25] <%MusicMan105> Unleash  Fel  really  needs  a  nerf
[2022-12-17 17:36:26] <deamqe> I also run Brann instead of the snake and it's even stronger
[2022-12-17 17:36:30] <guotung96lol> nerf fel barrage to not hit face
[2022-12-17 17:36:36] <%ell_papito> dont nerf relics
[2022-12-17 17:36:40] <%cizuss> my opinion is that the 3 mana spell damage +2 was a mistake to add at the same time as guild trader in the same rotation, too much spell damage at once
[2022-12-17 17:36:40] <%ell_papito> relics iare PepeLine
[2022-12-17 17:36:43] <cidarpunch> Nerf quest
[2022-12-17 17:36:44] <+JigglyJesse> think they have to nerf to 2 mana with the lifesteal aspect
[2022-12-17 17:36:47] <newbieplays> maybe increase the manathrist threshold

[2022-12-17 17:37:02] <bitbangboom> unleash fel should target all minions
[2022-12-17 17:37:12] <+bluedevilblue> Relics are fine.  Only broken because of rest of deck.
[2022-12-17 17:37:15] <%b0n3d4ddy> quest is the main issue tho thanks to the massive mana cheat
[2022-12-17 17:37:18] <%NakazatoJL> relics are fine YEP
[2022-12-17 17:37:23] <+PowerKirby> but dimension manacheat Madge
[2022-12-17 17:37:23] <%cizuss> and too much spell damage
[2022-12-17 17:37:24] <iSultan> make unleash a legendary card
[2022-12-17 17:37:24] <%willwait428> Should just be minions
[2022-12-17 17:37:33] VIEWERS: 780
[2022-12-17 17:37:36] <gymmaxxing> relic vault is the best card in the deck, its stupid at 2 mana
[2022-12-17 17:37:37] <%HyperionHS> yeah it should die to aggro decks and it don't
[2022-12-17 17:37:52] <bitbangboom> if unleash fel targets all minions it kills the spell damage
[2022-12-17 17:38:00] <randomlorplayer> they'll probably nerf unleash to 3 and thats it
[2022-12-17 17:38:08] <Gigobitto> that one spell def won't go face anymore
[2022-12-17 17:38:16] <Gigobitto> the lifesteal
[2022-12-17 17:38:18] <%willwait428> Shouldn‚Äôt go face
[2022-12-17 17:38:20] <bitbangboom> so they get the heal but the kill the minions
[2022-12-17 17:38:23] <+bluedevilblue> If they get rid of the heal, makes the deck countered by aggro.
[2022-12-17 17:38:27] <old_bay> @bitbangboom Pepega
[2022-12-17 17:38:30] <%HyperionHS> yeah i think. so
[2022-12-17 17:38:41] <%HyperionHS> youd have to fel barrage the ennemy minion

[2022-12-17 17:44:51] <newbieplays> why nerf anub card is fun should not be nerfed cause broken combo
[2022-12-17 17:44:51] <bitbangboom> druid is who makes brann so overpowered
[2022-12-17 17:44:58] <+bluedevilblue> People hate the way it feels, but it is not strong.  Not a reason to nerf it, IMO.
[2022-12-17 17:45:01] <%Ramanujoke> @FenoHS they talked about putting scale to 8 before
[2022-12-17 17:45:02] <KingOfBarbies> nothing wrong with nerfing new cards, as long as they buff the new cards of other classes that are not doing anything
[2022-12-17 17:45:04] <+PowerKirby> Druid beats bad players because they trade too much @FenoHS YEP
[2022-12-17 17:45:05] <%+CursedFish> @fake_based dk is playable, its just not tier 1
[2022-12-17 17:45:07] <Ritzyjet> it feels like druid has so many cards that are tuned in a way that make its matchups feast or famine
[2022-12-17 17:45:07] <%KBB24_Mamba_Forever> honestly if they just change carpentor to 3 mana or let it grab a spell 3 mana or less. then it would kill the consistency of druid @FenoHS
[2022-12-17 17:45:08] <6Moriarty9> the armor card ->3 mana
[2022-12-17 17:45:09] <guotung96lol> luna does
[2022-12-17 17:45:10] <%willwait428> How else does druid win?
[2022-12-17 17:45:17] <spazsalot> you can do 30 card Astalor Druid
[2022-12-17 17:45:17] <%+stingray772005> druid isnt that good just feels bad to lose too
[2022-12-17 17:45:18] <guotung96lol> in NA there's alot of druid in high lgend
[2022-12-17 17:45:23] <babyyshaark_> druid loses to the godlike trio of dh/rogue/priest
[2022-12-17 17:45:23] <+bluedevilblue> Luna has repeatedly tried to make a good Druid deck and they are just never quite good enough.
[2022-12-17 17:45:27] <cloister0> its just polarizing
[2022-12-17 17:45:28] <Giannhs1998> well everybody is playing DH so
[2022-12-17 17:45:28] <babyyshaark_> so its not good
[2022-12-17 17:45:35] <%KBB24_Mamba_Forever> there would be more risk to run ramp, insteas of always getting ramp
