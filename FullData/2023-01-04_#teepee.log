[2023-01-04 16:04:32] <@%^Streamlabs> Teep has not switched his input, he plays both KBM and controller. Typically he switches when it gets stale. His movement feels better on controller, but his shot feels better on mouse. He’s roughly a 70% - 30% split favoring controller. To tell what he is using, look under his spare plates, if "Y" (controller) if 4 (KBM). teepMnk

[2023-01-04 17:18:35] <!%FatThor66> @dirtkeef it means he has probably been reported a bunch because he's an ex-COD Pro, so he's good at the game.  People don't believe that there are others that can be better than them, so they report when they get killed.

[2023-01-04 17:19:10] <!%FatThor66> @dirtkeef Activision gets a lot of reports on one person, they can shadowban you to keep you from playing while they review your account for cheating. Can't play the game while your account is under review.
[2023-01-04 17:19:12] <%dirtkeef> @FatThor66 hmm interesting. or he was cheating, too. cant rule that out especially if the people at COD would ban him.
[2023-01-04 17:19:16] <%+savagejoesav> I wonder if its cause nade doesnt play alot so when he does and gets reported for being too good, he gets banned

[2023-01-04 17:53:11] <%reaper_19810> It has positives and negatives. On the one hand, you are avoiding getting ill. On the other, because your immune system isn't getting exposed to various illnesses as frequently, when you finally do catch something you get knocked on your ass.

[2023-01-04 17:53:50] <%+jims1973> Even if remote and sick you should take time to heal and get better!
[2023-01-04 17:53:52] <%silverstreak25> get out sean
[2023-01-04 17:53:53] <%sir_boosted> Yea stay the fuck home if you’re sick. But be responsible about your work   Pretty much just be an adult
[2023-01-04 17:53:53] <+Trueman301190> Yeah for sure. You can still work fform home with some illnesses. Coming in contact people is just unecessary in todays world
[2023-01-04 17:53:54] <%+AngryKoivu> I always thought I had a good immune system. Turns out I was just good at avoiding people who sneeze into your eyeballs while telling you a story
[2023-01-04 17:53:56] <%$maxipotomus> w. I don't like seeing people or leaving my house anyways
[2023-01-04 17:53:57] <@%toothick2fit> would having herpes be considered being sick?
[2023-01-04 17:53:57] <giggles5502> I still wear a mask when I go outside
[2023-01-04 17:53:58] <%+PandemicPatrick> Job is full remote now but if I'm really sick my boss is super chill and no expectation to work. Honestly, though most of the time i feel up to logging in because there's no commute and I can bank my Paid Time Off
[2023-01-04 17:54:00] <loganyoungblood> What’s up teep , would you rather be home in Texas or cali?
[2023-01-04 17:54:00] <%lwrcioperator> For me, its more acceptable to stay home if not feeling well vs. 3 years ago

[2023-01-04 17:54:01] <%+stevechea> being sick is much less stigmatized than it used it be
[2023-01-04 17:54:01] <%+willowbeazt> In my 40 years of watching football I'm still in shock from Monday night. Anyone else?
[2023-01-04 17:54:01] <dannyvader22> I think it's a good/bad thing. It's bad being judged but good thing taking off when you're sick. It's important we normalize that. The pandemic showed the importance of being considerate and think of the health of others.

[2023-01-04 22:21:38] <@%^Streamlabs> https://twitch.amazon.com/prime If you have amazon prime, you can have a free sub each month for 30 days. You can also get a month of prime for free or students get either 6 or 12 months prime for free! If trying to sub on mobile, iPhone users have to go to the desktop version of twitch.
