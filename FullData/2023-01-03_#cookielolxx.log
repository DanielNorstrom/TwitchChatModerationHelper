[2023-01-03 17:03:26] <dopamlna> Hi, I think "map awareness" its better :D
[2023-01-03 17:03:26] <%+Morrky> so, that just evens things up  a bit
[2023-01-03 17:03:28] <TheWheele> People would ghost in pro play if possible.
[2023-01-03 17:03:28] <%remumix10> how did 1 win in lp gain if he got 16 and 1 was lower than 12???
[2023-01-03 17:03:30] <+Dracosowo> who wouldnt take a free win by ghosting
[2023-01-03 17:03:31] <%+Morrky> they need to ghost to win against you
[2023-01-03 17:03:33] <@%joudaTW> 60 is too much
[2023-01-03 17:03:42] <shade0884> i can easier understand a lot of macro decisions with map

[2023-01-03 17:30:12] <re4s_as> Nilah, conceptually doesn't work as an ADC imo. They should just make her a solo laner by changing the passive

[2023-01-03 17:43:08] <Arvapor9> Have you ever lost a bot lane with the feeling that neither you or your adc/supp have bad ideas, just not the same at the same time? Like if you are not playing bad, you just don't connect
[2023-01-03 17:43:18] <saltytakis> @jviimvs i mean if you are expecting to get to chall in a single season might as well give up lol
