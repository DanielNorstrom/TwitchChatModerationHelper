[2023-01-10 19:00:06] <%dognus88> make it spicy and have Medusa stun on crits.
[2023-01-10 19:00:10] <tankyfranky42> That makes sense
[2023-01-10 19:00:16] <%+lightforceten> it is so embarrasing for smite that the store always works but it takes 15 log ins to actually get in a queue
[2023-01-10 19:00:20] <+fl45hbrg> Would it be so toxic for medusa ult to just stun everytime?
[2023-01-10 19:00:23] <tankyfranky42> So it’s for the luls
[2023-01-10 19:00:24] <@%$air2jodran3> @essenceofchickendrink taking it one month at a time for now
[2023-01-10 19:00:30] <%+Andy1134> for the spice
[2023-01-10 19:00:37] <@%TubbyTheSatan> @fl45hbrg that would make the ability way too good
[2023-01-10 19:00:41] <%$EsquireVT> @lightforceten cuz you can't make money in queues
[2023-01-10 19:00:42] <%dognus88> for spice.

[2023-01-10 19:01:12] <%+acraine1> Make dusa ult do a lil less damage but the inner part always stuns
[2023-01-10 19:01:16] <%$EsquireVT> @MichaelxVoorheees can confirm
[2023-01-10 19:01:20] <%+lightforceten> @EsquireVT yep. smite is a cosmetic store that sometimes features a game

[2023-01-10 19:01:32] <%dognus88> it's spicy lore. she coupd insta kill a kraken, so her ult should 1shot lulu in ult too

[2023-01-10 19:01:39] <+fl45hbrg> @TubbyTheSatan lower the stun duration but make it stun reliably. I think her kit has been overshadoweded by power creep
[2023-01-10 19:01:59] <%$EsquireVT> @MichaelxVoorheees i've tried to air-fry pizza twice now, both times, crispy crust, ice cold pep

[2023-01-10 19:02:21] <@%TubbyTheSatan> @fl45hbrg no, do not make the giant aoe cone stun everyone for a long ass range. That would make it ymir freeze but with full auto range on the stun also known as way too fk good
[2023-01-10 19:02:22] <%+acraine1> @esquirevt Your frying it on too high of a temp

[2023-01-10 19:02:52] <%$EsquireVT> @acraine1 i tried to go for temp over time, looks like i need time over temp
[2023-01-10 19:02:54] <%+dragonxmon> let Medusa pick up any god she stuns and throw them at other gods for the spice
[2023-01-10 19:03:02] <%+TruePlewd> @fl45hbrg Dusa still has metas where she is extremely strong. I don't think she needs any real reworks.
[2023-01-10 19:03:06] <+fl45hbrg> @TubbyTheSatan with how dr works now it doesnt seem that bad, now
[2023-01-10 19:03:14] <@%MichaelxVoorheees> @esquirevt i microwave it and wrap it in a paper towel to hold the heat and such in.
[2023-01-10 19:03:16] <%+acraine1> @esquirevt yeah that will help a lot
[2023-01-10 19:03:33] <@%TubbyTheSatan> @fl45hbrg then just start off the teamfight with it and the dr makes no change
