[2022-12-25 05:22:00] <%Koalasniffer7> Aw did I bruise your little ego you try to uphold by being a chat janitor for a girl who doesn‚Äôt know you exist? What a pathetic existence, so deprived of any control in your meaningless life. So desperate for validation and attention. Trapped in parasocial relationships because nobody likes you irl. Embarrassing. What a fucking loser.

[2022-12-25 05:37:03] <%Richardong> Holy fucking shit. I want to bang Bunger from Bugsnax so goddamn bad. I can't stand it anymore. Every time I play Bugsnax I get a massive erection. I've seen literally every rule 34 post there is of him online. My dreams are nothing but constant fucking sex with Bunger. I'm sick of waking up every morning with six nuts in my boxers and knowing that those are nuts that should've been busted inside of Bunger's tight bun. I want him to have my mutant Bugsnax babies

[2022-12-25 07:45:39] <%Maggie_is_tired> wait people are still here? lol thats really weird. i was just gunna click on a vod to watch cuz a friend recommended it and saw you guys still sitting here when the streamer isnt even live. Honestly you guys need a life lmfao, sitting it a streamers chat all day wont make you feel better and it wont improve your chances of sleeping with her, not like you had any to begin with lmfao. you guys are just so pathetic. Later!
[2022-12-25 07:45:39] <%+AlexPotion> omg one of my biggest pet peeves is when someone says something funny and no one reacts to it unless the streamer does
