[2022-12-27 20:13:23] <LeglessLeopard> Why settle for a boring old deck filled with predictable, one-dimensional cards when you can have the thrill and excitement of an evolve deck? With evolve decks in Hearthstone, you never know what you're going to get.  One minute you might have a measly 1/1 on the board, and the next you could have a giant, game-winning monster thanks to the power of evolution. And let's not forget about the element of surprise. Your opponent will never see it coming when you suddenly transform a small minion
[2022-12-27 20:13:25] <LeglessLeopard> into a giant, game-ending threat.  Plus, evolve decks are super easy to play. Just throw a bunch of random minions on the board and let the magic of evolution do the rest. Who needs strategy or careful planning when you have the power of evolution on your side?  So if you want to shake up your Hearthstone experience and add a little excitement to your gameplay, give evolve decks a try. You'll never know what you'll evolve into next!

[2022-12-27 20:15:09] <LeglessLeopard> Well, let me tell you, not getting lethal in Hearthstone is a true art form. It takes a special kind of player to pull off the feat of having all the right cards and positioning, only to somehow still not be able to finish off your opponent.  But fear not, my friend, because you are clearly a master of this art. You should be proud of yourself for not being able to close out the game, despite having all the tools you needed at your disposal. It takes a certain level of finesse to mess up a see
[2022-12-27 20:15:10] <LeglessLeopard> mingly easy win, and you have definitely achieved it.  So pat yourself on the back and revel in your glory. Not getting lethal may not be something to brag about to your friends, but it's a unique accomplishment that only a select few truly understand. Keep on not getting lethal and you'll be the envy of all your opponents!

[2022-12-27 21:05:23] <@L0RINDA> and i know that's unpopular opinion
[2022-12-27 21:05:27] <@%Tinyfred> Agreed. These nerfs did nothing but make the game worse
[2022-12-27 21:05:29] <Spaghetti100> they printed renethal, powercept everything so that you could kill 40hp, removed renethal and now 30hp is a joke

[2022-12-27 21:05:42] <Panlenka> @L0RINDA agreed, no single deck out performing everything, plenty of options

[2022-12-27 21:06:02] <SoEmpty322> exactly they just made the game around 40 hp, but then 40 hp went to 30 LUL
[2022-12-27 21:06:05] <!%bmkibler> Also it's hilarious to me that the quest is busted in so many decks that don't even want to complete it

[2022-12-27 21:06:11] <@L0RINDA> @Panlenka I think Masetra probably needs a tweak
[2022-12-27 21:06:17] <ShellBasher1> The Renathal nerf has to be one of the dumbest nerfs ever. The positives that nenathal brought WAY overshadowed the negatives
