[2023-01-08 00:01:02] <itchybunzzz> you should unlcok them all anyway
[2023-01-08 00:01:21] <%+NopeBadguy> there are a few places

[2023-01-08 00:01:59] <Yami_Hottodogu> LUL
[2023-01-08 00:02:06] <%+NopeBadguy> breaker is a physical attacker, bodyguard is a dark knight and uses health to attack
[2023-01-08 00:02:14] <%+NopeBadguy> musician is a magic attacker with its own job gauge
[2023-01-08 00:02:31] <%+NopeBadguy> idol is a good job for saeko, hostess is good too
[2023-01-08 00:02:57] <%+NopeBadguy> ichi can be a great breaker
[2023-01-08 00:02:57] <%+InfiniDragon> That dominatrix job was kinda awful if I recall right so I never really used it
[2023-01-08 00:03:04] <%+NopeBadguy> i think adachi has riot cop if you want him to be even more of a tank
[2023-01-08 00:03:09] <%+NopeBadguy> bodyguard is great for him too
[2023-01-08 00:03:19] <CrazyPizzaDiamond> yes
[2023-01-08 00:03:20] <%+NopeBadguy> yeah, but that's later

[2023-01-08 00:03:52] <%+NopeBadguy> just try a bunch of different jobs and see what sticks
[2023-01-08 00:04:00] <%+NopeBadguy> hero is a great job, but it only has defensive skill boosts
[2023-01-08 00:04:22] <%+NopeBadguy> does adachi have riot cop rn?
[2023-01-08 00:04:25] <%krunchi7> "endless desire" from musician is pretty useful to unlock
[2023-01-08 00:04:29] <KruelDestiny> Okayge üëç sounds like a plan

[2023-01-08 21:03:19] <%ClumsyOcelot> It's a cultural difference too right? because families can be more strict and you always feel as if you don't want to disappoint your parents and make them proud of you
