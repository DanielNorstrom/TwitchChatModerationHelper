[2023-01-09 07:31:47] <@%Tazny> @talrielz Its not lagging or crashing its just not working correctly. Like when I start playing a game it gives me some random deck from years ago rather than my current one, if it even loads a deck at all
[2023-01-09 07:31:49] <%talrielz> 5 years of runs saved on it starts to slow it down lol

[2023-01-09 09:51:26] <%talrielz> does this guy coach octopi or is he himself an octopus who is also a coach
[2023-01-09 09:51:35] <%talrielz> and if so, what is he coaching them to do
[2023-01-09 09:51:51] <@%Queen__Ari> because he played really well by having minions die
[2023-01-09 09:51:59] <%Veritas_12647> It has a really complex setup though, so it's fine.
[2023-01-09 09:52:13] <@%Queen__Ari> yeah thats a good documentary
[2023-01-09 09:52:19] <!%+topdekka> it was an interesting show

[2023-01-09 09:58:18] <%Synastar> I wonder why Blizzard Decided to give Death Knights as a class an additional resource
[2023-01-09 09:58:43] <%Synastar> If they are going to do that then they should revamp the other classes and give them resources too
[2023-01-09 09:58:48] <%Veritas_12647> I had really bad luck rolling DK at the start of the meta. 3 out of 38 drafts. Kind of killed all my interest. All 3 DK's went 12 and none of the other 35 runs did. this was pre-nerf.
[2023-01-09 09:59:02] <%Synastar> Warriors could get rage, rogues could get energy etc

[2023-01-09 10:57:19] <%+Thehomedemon360> i think it would it be okay to have arena be where people draft Tier 2-3 decks that could compete in semi-low ranks (in standard) with synergies that aren‚Äôt meta but they‚Äôre fun
[2023-01-09 10:57:26] <%+fiximol> YOU KNOW VIBE IT UP wideVibe YOU KNOW TO VIBE IT UP wideVibe
[2023-01-09 10:57:28] <%+Thehomedemon360> but instead it‚Äôs draft the broken card simulator
[2023-01-09 10:57:32] <%talrielz> the sad reality is the DK is actually the most fun design they have created for the drafting experience
[2023-01-09 10:57:41] <%talrielz> so i still think it would be mostly dks even in that case
[2023-01-09 10:57:48] <%+fiximol> yes, and I hate that people are hating on DK FeelsBadMan
[2023-01-09 10:57:54] <%+fiximol> and not appreciating how well designed the class is
[2023-01-09 10:58:03] <%+fiximol> I blame the dev team for that Madge

[2023-01-09 10:58:20] <%Quantum_TTV> when it comes to veiwer, how is your viewership today compare to the viewership you had 2 years ago? like you dreads judge, do you guys got more viewer or it went down a bit?

[2023-01-09 10:58:53] <%talrielz> their takeaway should be to make more classes like DK while in the mean time curbing the current imbalance

[2023-01-09 11:06:48] <%+Thehomedemon360> no purposely bad cards i feel like a new player can make a deck that fits a role but i see current arena more as a pick the broken card simulator and stuff a ton of bad cards into the deck

[2023-01-09 11:08:54] <%+Thehomedemon360> in an ideal world classes have different niches and you can have a ton of variation when you go and draft a class but it‚Äôs more like this class has these good cards, get them or lose

[2023-01-09 11:09:38] <%Comeo> I see everyone talk a lot about how to improve arena, but how would blizz make profit off it?  You don't ever have to buy new xpacs or really spend gold if you're any good or at least do the daily/weekly quests
[2023-01-09 11:09:41] <%+Thehomedemon360> but it‚Äôs more like here are the good rogue cards and you can hope to get them
[2023-01-09 11:10:06] <%talrielz> cosmetics and people aspiring and learning to get to where they can play infinitely
[2023-01-09 11:10:32] <%talrielz> many people who exclusively play arena buy the cosmetics just look at savefile

[2023-01-09 11:11:14] <%+fiximol> @Comeo If you make people WANT to play it, they will pay for it. Most people probably have less than 1000g

[2023-01-09 11:11:30] <%+fiximol> So they will either save up and play arena (if it is worth playing) or pay for it
[2023-01-09 11:11:35] <%+fiximol> Sell arena tickets in bundles
[2023-01-09 11:11:37] <%Comeo> Save's a streamer though, not really a fair argument there
[2023-01-09 11:11:50] <%+fiximol> Sell a arena sub that gives you 3 tickets a week
[2023-01-09 11:12:03] <%zeddtinn> @fiximol i think that makes sense
[2023-01-09 11:12:03] <%talrielz> then you can't use exceptionary people (those that can afford to play the game infinitely) as an example
[2023-01-09 11:12:05] <KULIXIS> Yep you do get it even after it dies
[2023-01-09 11:12:05] <%talrielz> because most cannot

[2023-01-09 11:17:17] <%talrielz> @Thehomedemon360 it buffs only minions played from hand but the way the ordering works it buffs the first copy of the taunts and then the other 2 copy the initial one's buff

[2023-01-09 12:53:50] <pamalshnake> People in the chat act like this is the first time they see arena. It has been like that for a while now
[2023-01-09 12:53:51] <forgotaboutbre> That was neat
[2023-01-09 12:53:52] <%+fiximol> Seems fair to me. Your opponent had a dreads deck and got what they deserved
[2023-01-09 12:54:18] <adventures_w_otto> and duel type minions
[2023-01-09 12:54:21] <%talrielz> its felt like 6 months
[2023-01-09 12:54:25] <%talrielz> this has been a god awful month
[2023-01-09 12:54:33] <%zeddtinn> @FalloutChallenges why? as a class i feel it's very well designed.
[2023-01-09 12:54:44] <%+fiximol> I still enjoy this rotation A LOT MORE THAN DUAL CLASS
[2023-01-09 12:55:07] <%talrielz> its impressive they can make the game so awful that this is somehow preferable
[2023-01-09 12:55:10] <@%Tazny> Bad bomber SMOrc
[2023-01-09 12:55:12] <%talrielz> i wouldnt believe it if i didnt see it
[2023-01-09 12:55:27] <%zeddtinn> this rotation was great as an intro to a new class
[2023-01-09 12:55:38] <AllaMassterran> but he deals 3 damage for 2 mana to face and it's 3/2
