[2023-01-04 03:01:41] <Kuligon> i msis that system, because then you could see who is underperforming, made the game more toxic though
[2023-01-04 03:01:48] <%zorg666> cause profiles were public in ow1
[2023-01-04 03:02:04] <%+kirbyyyxox> yup

[2023-01-04 03:02:25] <azzaroo_> The medals were stupid and it was so toxic, I’m glad they got removed because you would literally have every moira saying “come on guys, I’ve got 5 gold medals?!”
[2023-01-04 03:02:31] <+leminaid> like the endorsement levels???

[2023-01-04 03:02:58] <resetreptiles> OW1 was depressing as hell. You'd win 5 games and get +50SR and then you'd lose 1 game and get -60SR. That shit gave me so much anxiety

[2023-01-04 03:03:25] <Kuligon> ow1 profiles were public and there was 6 stats split up into 3 tiers of medals, if you had no medals that means you were garbo

[2023-01-04 05:38:38] <%zorg666> @fabriisio yeah I know, I just thought she meant she was considering ending when this VOD is forced to end at 48
[2023-01-04 05:38:41] <%pocketcompass> that's so evil
