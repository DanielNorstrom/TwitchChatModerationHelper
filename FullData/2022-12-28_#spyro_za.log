[2022-12-28 11:21:11] <%EmilleJ> Snap is more fun at this point in time @shashank0034
[2022-12-28 11:21:23] <tenVolten> hey Spyro, you are a great streamer, keep up the good work. Best of luck to you
[2022-12-28 11:21:30] <shashank0034> but is it more actually, or if it's because ur new
[2022-12-28 11:21:33] <%BAPreda> could've one-turn poisoned
[2022-12-28 11:21:42] <%north_forever> Gwent
[2022-12-28 11:21:43] VIEWERS: 191
[2022-12-28 11:21:45] <shashank0034> probably snap
[2022-12-28 11:21:47] <%EmilleJ> Gwent would be more fun yes
[2022-12-28 11:21:47] <@%zubedoo> for me Gwent is always more fun, Snap is a toilet mobile game KEKG
[2022-12-28 11:21:48] <saucersigi> Snap KEKW
[2022-12-28 11:21:52] <%Mark_Loop> I haven't even played snap and I'll say snap
[2022-12-28 11:22:01] <%EmilleJ> Im just comparing to what we have in gwent at the moment
[2022-12-28 11:22:03] <@%qnerr> there's no new card game that's why people test snap but this game doesn't even have a future in esports
[2022-12-28 11:22:04] <%north_forever> but honestly DOOM
[2022-12-28 11:22:05] <@%qnerr> so
[2022-12-28 11:22:06] <@%zubedoo> I'd love to finish my dailies in snap while taking a shite KEKG
[2022-12-28 11:22:09] <%$Keen_OMG> marvel ist fun and fast. but is not a high level challenge
[2022-12-28 11:22:10] <%EmilleJ> But two different games honestly

[2022-12-28 11:22:18] <shashank0034> in snap, most cards are viable

[2022-12-28 14:27:48] <kavinskky> yeah, when you start gwent it's toooo overwhelming

[2022-12-28 14:28:06] <%north_forever> Gwent is well was popular because of witcher
[2022-12-28 14:28:14] <%Mark_Loop> No way gwent is more complicated to mtga/duel links
[2022-12-28 14:28:15] <%Mark_Loop> Clueless
[2022-12-28 14:28:20] <live_fast_die_fat> because every card game has random element and then the players reeeee over them being unlucky
[2022-12-28 14:28:27] <@%+xahverius> @kavinskky 3 years ago it wasnt. I liked it cause cards were very well explained and 2 lines max
[2022-12-28 14:28:27] <tumy99> yeah gwent is hard, and the onboarding (tutorial) being not great makes it worse
[2022-12-28 14:28:40] <@%+xahverius> it has complicated these last few years
[2022-12-28 14:28:44] <criticalinfusion> i think that gwont is actually harder than MTG A

[2022-12-28 14:29:27] <criticalinfusion> yep
