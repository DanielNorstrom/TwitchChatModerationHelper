[2022-12-23 16:30:01] <!%Kaladas_> thats how we did it. big gift from Santa. But only 1
[2022-12-23 16:30:01] <!%$DeePick> 1 santa the rest family
[2022-12-23 16:30:02] <!%erebus56> i love the pride of that. god damn.
[2022-12-23 16:30:09] <%+SHAGGY_KNEES> right but it is MY money not Santa's
[2022-12-23 16:30:09] <+LordJakeRyan> that one present better be worth all the other presents combined
[2022-12-23 16:30:13] <%knockinpistols> no thats so your kid doesnt go brag to the poor kids about all the toys santa brought you but they didnt get shit
[2022-12-23 16:30:15] <%hothambell> same here
[2022-12-23 16:30:18] <!%m1jordanallen> what we used to do is 1 or 2 big parent gifts and TONS of cheap shit from santa
[2022-12-23 16:30:18] <%$Richmon117> I maybe got 1 my entire childhood from my parents
[2022-12-23 16:30:19] <Magnallia> its to help low income kids not feel bad if they dont get much from santa

[2022-12-23 16:30:21] <%juh4ni_gg> i never got presents from santa, either no name or from relatives
[2022-12-23 16:30:22] <%The_Knight_Owl> prob closer to half/half for me
[2022-12-23 16:30:22] <Senoden> mum and dad would get me the big present, the rest was santa
[2022-12-23 16:30:27] <!%erebus56> like parents, set your pride aside and let the kids be kids. they really don't give two fucks if you give it to them or santa, just let it be santa
[2022-12-23 16:30:28] <+testanomics> 1 from mom and dad, stockings from mom and dad, everything else from fat man (not jon, santa)
[2022-12-23 16:30:28] BAN: testanomics (5s), testanomics (5s)
[2022-12-23 16:30:31] <%$sarosa25> @jonbams these moms are something else I got way more than one thing from Santa growing up
[2022-12-23 16:30:33] <%$jsTronix> It's best for the under-privileged families when the kids talk to other kids about what they got.
[2022-12-23 16:30:33] <%+DEPjrTX> Never told my kids Santa brought shit, once they know you lie about "good" stuff trust is kinda damaged

[2022-12-23 16:30:37] <%Hamparty> the things i wanted were from santa and the other gifts were from parents
[2022-12-23 16:30:37] <%$doodlebop16> @knockinpistols that's what my partner just explained to me and it makes a lot of sense
[2022-12-23 16:30:38] <NoBucks> No bullshit I‚Äôm the one buying that shit not Santa lmao

[2022-12-23 16:39:41] <@%+JarnoVH> probably half the people see it but are too pussy to say it just like u
[2022-12-23 16:39:51] <imaginarytaco_> When you build mega builds, what do you use as reference to scale them and convert them for Minecraft?
[2022-12-23 16:39:57] <%this_is_clem_fandango_> only gotta work for 20 more minutes then I have the rest of the year off! yaaay!
[2022-12-23 16:39:57] <SuDDenLife> @JonBams it is always worth it. Otherwise you risk that your community is going to shit. Conflict delayed is conflict multiplied.

[2022-12-23 16:42:34] <%+TraffiCoaN> how it works in NJ is that you get 1 license per location, but having a license makes it easier to get more

[2022-12-23 16:42:49] <%$doodlebop16> better to have legal than not though

[2022-12-23 16:42:55] <naughty_eyebrow> the difference is the dealers never owned the product so they couldnt make  discounts. boss wanted full amount

[2022-12-23 18:18:19] <@%^Nightbot> This giant hole is for a giant Wither Skeleton farm. The hole was started in December 2019, but got sidetracked. This was cleared BY HAND (and a lot of repairing of tools). This hole's chunks were generated before the 1.16 update, before Netherite was a thing (SO no netherite was found in the hole). Jon did not copy Ph1lza, this is "standard" practice of clearing every spawn surface for a spawn farm. The floor is spawn protected via a layer of glass.
