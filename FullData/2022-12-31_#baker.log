[2022-12-31 02:26:24] <%+TrickmasteH> so they just cancel the check in a certain amount of time the funds get reveresed, and the re-cut me a new cheque once AP department re-opens strentghie.

[2022-12-31 02:27:59] <@%+strengthie> He will get it back but he's out for 2-3 months
[2022-12-31 02:28:06] <%+TrickmasteH> the company will re-issue the cheque once the funds are reversed.
[2022-12-31 02:28:11] <%+TrickmasteH> and it typically takes like 3 business days.
[2022-12-31 02:28:21] <%+TrickmasteH> but during holidays, its different.
[2022-12-31 02:28:25] <@%+strengthie> plus any fees for payments he's missing
[2022-12-31 02:28:30] <+klone_iron_fist> @micahlee83 we have a few of those in the neighbourhood, one ran past me mid day 3 days ago

[2022-12-31 02:28:47] <%+TrickmasteH> the company is very nice to me that issues the cheque, fortantley strentghie its not locked to my bank account or anything

[2022-12-31 02:30:18] <!%micahlee83> @TrickmasteH any way you can switch it to direct deposit going forward?
[2022-12-31 02:30:26] <%+TrickmasteH> the biggest thing that makes me think about, is what this person is going through to sacrfice there bank account / life for small amount of money. Probably only 500-2000$ they would recieve at best. I asked about direct deposit micha long ago
[2022-12-31 02:30:30] <%+TrickmasteH> but this company is weird.
[2022-12-31 02:30:59] <%polig> i think its NA thing, i doubt stuff like that works on EU banking
[2022-12-31 02:31:16] <!%micahlee83> you in Canada Trick?
[2022-12-31 02:31:17] <%+TrickmasteH> Because it takes time to build credit with a bank to be able to deposit a cheque and get money back quickly.
