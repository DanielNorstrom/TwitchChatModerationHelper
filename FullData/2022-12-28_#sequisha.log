[2022-12-28 01:29:15] <%JackBlaque> alright, spent a week deciding what PC case to get for my new build
[2022-12-28 01:29:20] <%JackBlaque> I hope I don't regret it
[2022-12-28 01:29:29] <%JackBlaque> now time to figure out what CPU/MOBO to get
[2022-12-28 01:59:28] <zenolurk> 13900

[2022-12-28 03:22:14] <%JackBlaque> @zenolurk I went with 13600k
[2022-12-28 03:24:47] <%JackBlaque> jeez, I posted this in chat, and like 4 scammers messaged me
[2022-12-28 03:25:30] <zenolurk> thats fine too, newgen cpu are all pretty dope
[2022-12-28 03:25:44] <%JackBlaque> yeah, I"m on a 7700k
[2022-12-28 03:25:50] <%JackBlaque> and its starting to feel its age
[2022-12-28 03:25:57] <%JackBlaque> keeping my 2080ti tho
[2022-12-28 03:26:11] <%JackBlaque> I just can't justify an upgrade of that yet
[2022-12-28 03:26:20] <%JackBlaque> what with the games I currently play
[2022-12-28 03:26:28] <%JackBlaque> I'm so sad intel arc bombed
[2022-12-28 03:26:34] <%JackBlaque> I hope they stay in tho
[2022-12-28 03:26:45] <%JackBlaque> 3 companies has to help the market
[2022-12-28 03:27:18] <zenolurk> the 2080ti will run all games with that cpu
[2022-12-28 03:27:36] <zenolurk> pretty sure 7700k can bottleneck with that cpu
[2022-12-28 03:27:40] <zenolurk> gpu*
[2022-12-28 03:28:00] <%JackBlaque> plus, 7700k isn't win 11 compatible
[2022-12-28 03:28:02] <%JackBlaque> which sucks
[2022-12-28 03:31:21] <%JackBlaque> oh hell yeah
