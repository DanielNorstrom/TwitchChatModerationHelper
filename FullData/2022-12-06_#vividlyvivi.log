[2022-12-06 15:04:57] <LordAziki> Sega also seems to support emulation since they used it to sell some old games.
[2022-12-06 15:04:59] <JilEmma_Reene> @MainRayne that's actually on the way
[2022-12-06 15:04:59] <%Plolzikx> exactly. if you can't purchase on the primary market, you can't support the creators. Emulation is good.

[2022-12-06 15:06:02] <LordAziki> Gamestop also doesn't give money to the creators since they are known to sell new copies as used copies to keep all the profit.
[2022-12-06 15:06:03] <%ultragunner5> @koalalover70 do you know EBay doesn't support game creators?
[2022-12-06 15:06:06] <%Plolzikx> exactly. if you can't give money to the creators, there is no reason not to emulate
[2022-12-06 15:06:23] <%robinthebobbin99> It's not like the developers put the game on ebay!

[2022-12-06 15:06:28] <blarging2000s> Companies that say emulation is bad are the same companies that will use it themselves when it suits them.
[2022-12-06 15:06:36] <%$koalalover70> True, also most of them are con artists
[2022-12-06 15:06:47] <%Plolzikx> The only real reason to buy games second hand is if you want a physical copy for some reason
[2022-12-06 15:06:49] <Samcool3333> yeah it doesn't benefit the creators on eBay
[2022-12-06 15:06:50] <!MainRayne> To be perfectly fair, most of the older games I emulate are ones I had the disc for back in the day but just have no way to play anymore
[2022-12-06 15:06:53] [Notification] Shwaa subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 9 months, currently on a 7 month streak! [vividComfysquish]
[2022-12-06 15:06:56] <%ultragunner5> buying in EBay is ok, but should never be a MUST. Emulation good my dudes
[2022-12-06 15:07:01] <@%AfroSquirrel> Maybe the last one needs you to wait a cycle?
[2022-12-06 15:07:02] <!MainRayne> Like I emulate kirby air ride, but that disc is in my mum's house somewhere
[2022-12-06 15:07:05] <jozath12> hmm.... maybe you need to wait longer before jumping... cuppyHmm
[2022-12-06 15:07:14] <%MelkorTheGreat> Where you end up on the platforms doesn't center, so maybe aiming to end up more towards the left on the earlier platforms would help line up the last one.
