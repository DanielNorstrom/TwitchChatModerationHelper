[2022-12-10 19:08:42] <@%Entity7x> 16 seasons in and needed to update footsteps, replicator across the map, random error codes, better servers as they promised, deadsliding, better skins, better battle passes, new game engine that isnt 18 years old with the tickrate of like 10
[2022-12-10 19:08:59] <%nitdss> @formings_ yes usually for superglides

[2022-12-10 19:09:27] <Illuminary_> @Entity7x way to much, the most they give us is shitty 160$ legendary skins
[2022-12-10 19:09:28] <%+ParkBO> faideWhy faideAre faideYou
[2022-12-10 19:09:28] <@%RipCr0w_97> EA uses multi play servers which are super cheap
[2022-12-10 19:09:30] <PlanetZora> This game is bleeding out. It needs something crazy to shake things up. This game is bleeding out. Like a fast paced TDM with advanced movement.
[2022-12-10 19:09:32] <formings_> The 10 tickrate servers needa go

[2022-12-10 19:09:48] <hakst3r123> @Entity7x this game engine is responsible for all the cool new movement techs
[2022-12-10 19:10:02] <xd_unicornman> !heirlooms
[2022-12-10 19:10:02] <@%^Nightbot>* Faide has the Wraith, Bang, Octane, Gibby, Caustic, Rampart and Loba's heirloom.
[2022-12-10 19:10:02] <@%RipCr0w_97> There should be no absolute reason as to why we are playing on 20 hz servers
[2022-12-10 19:10:03] <@%Entity7x> hopefully they work on some of the shit when s16 comes
[2022-12-10 19:10:08] <+MrHersheyyy> @PlanetZora It's sad how much they refuse to change things
[2022-12-10 19:10:08] <rKaizer> u are so big xd
[2022-12-10 19:10:09] <@%RipCr0w_97> Bara I doubt it
[2022-12-10 19:10:12] [Announcement] <Nightbot> Have you seen Faide's Recent youtube video? Movement Player Unlocks The Tier 3 Prestige Wraith Skin... - https://youtu.be/HaT4BkWoJa8
[2022-12-10 19:10:29] <@%RipCr0w_97> and pretty I'd give this game another year in terms of its survival
[2022-12-10 19:10:34] <eco1988> move up boiz i snipe him down
[2022-12-10 19:10:44] <Illuminary_> @RipCr0w_97 for real tho
[2022-12-10 19:10:44] <formings_> why don’t they leave control mode permanent
[2022-12-10 19:10:49] <state0fmind> Remember to buy some heirlooms and skins so we can get improvements to the game

[2022-12-10 19:10:51] <@%Entity7x> @hakst3r123 yeah i understand that, dont you think they can update it tho, like fort theyve been thru couple engines so far and it has the same shit

[2022-12-10 19:11:55] <SourPinapples> @seifmohamed421 people need to grow upand just play the game instead of whining when they get rolled

[2022-12-10 19:15:38] <Illuminary_> @RipCr0w_97 i feel like if respawn seperated from EA the game gets better instantly. they should have the funds to do so, seeing as they have 3 new games coming out. especially jedi survivor
