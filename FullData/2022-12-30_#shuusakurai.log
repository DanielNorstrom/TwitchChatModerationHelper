[2022-12-30 11:03:24] <+rikirinka> but i have found that with enough sauce or cheese or something masking them i can tolerate it
[2022-12-30 11:03:28] <0_Osama404> @orionsayshi12345 it just tastes bad
[2022-12-30 11:03:39] <+grookeyyt_1> The only forms of tomato’s that are good is sauce and the oval ones
[2022-12-30 11:03:47] <+rikirinka> i am not willingly eating it but i will force it bc i have to

[2022-12-30 13:20:11] <HenpaiDesu> @n4n4v1 there is no standard. it would be pro by then
[2022-12-30 13:20:23] <%+rikirinka> back then it was called manga studio 5 and it was licensed under a different company in the US
