[2022-12-19 16:26:06] <+shotodza> @TommyKayLIVE the meshes work like this: you connect one with the cable to your router. the 2nd one you put on a different room and expands your network, doesn't repeat it, therefore you don't have 2 networks. is like a router but it expands it.

[2022-12-19 17:08:37] <%f0reignerX> war strategies?
[2022-12-19 17:08:39] <viktor_mehl> i prefer wathcing solo zomboid hoenstly
[2022-12-19 17:08:40] <%WaterIsHydrating> I actually think you solo playing it would be better streaming content
[2022-12-19 17:08:40] <%+Electroblazer> I've been playing alot of Zomboid recently Vanilla+ is so good for it
[2022-12-19 17:08:42] <%HamdyGaming1> yeah solo play with mods
[2022-12-19 17:08:47] <@SEWl> @TommyKayLIVE im playing rn zomboid to get back into it for version 42
[2022-12-19 17:08:52] <@%TheBjornen> Tommy solo zomboid were the good times FeelsStrongMan
[2022-12-19 17:08:54] <%+TheKC> u need steward not leader @TommyKayLIVE
[2022-12-19 17:08:55] <%Hutitutti> solo zomboid could be a thing. Maybe start surviving in winter
[2022-12-19 17:09:05] <%WaterIsHydrating> the thing with multiplayer is it becomes more about the group and less about you in peril
[2022-12-19 17:09:06] <@^Nightbot> This channel is the pinnacle of HOI4 gameplay and it is presented by the best HOI4 player. So you should follow to watch more streams.

[2022-12-19 17:09:14] <dedective000> Project Zomboid Solo with mods can be very interesting

[2022-12-19 17:09:32] <viktor_mehl> i watch it solo more than multi so i dunno
[2022-12-19 17:09:45] <peer__k> @TommyKayLIVE wil you ever get back to Valheim it just got a huge update ?
[2022-12-19 17:09:45] <%+Electroblazer> Is there a way I can like send u possible good mods for zomboid?
[2022-12-19 17:09:45] <%+hunterwolfsbane> i think once they add NPC survivors solo zomboid will be way more fun imo
[2022-12-19 17:09:46] <darthttyranus> can you be a cavalry
[2022-12-19 17:09:54] <ApplePieAlive> once 42 comes out it will be the best
[2022-12-19 17:09:58] <%WaterIsHydrating> Multiplayer is more just listening to people shout over each other and meme about rather than watching the game
[2022-12-19 17:09:58] <%mrschwabbelaim> Found my glasses and texted you XD
[2022-12-19 17:10:04] <%Foxx_1111> you need stewardship for when you make your own warband
[2022-12-19 17:10:06] <%DarKinLove_rl> it could be you could stream ms paint and people would watch
[2022-12-19 17:10:09] <leogutschow> Zomboid is a very underrated indie game
[2022-12-19 17:10:31] <defensiveMAN> I think zomboid is the best game on stream except for ck2
[2022-12-19 17:10:35] <%+Bempa24> No worries.. also got a cold.. just chill having someone to listen to in the background :)

[2022-12-19 17:11:00] <%WaterIsHydrating> Zomboid is a very depressing game, it's great but just a downer

[2022-12-19 17:11:54] <%WaterIsHydrating> @tommykaylive have you tried getting any Swiss achievements yet? I managed to get them all in one run as a Switzerland that joins allies, I'd say it was 3/10 for difficulty.
[2022-12-19 17:12:03] <ApplePieAlive> its not the best horror game there are games that expedite that feeling ten fold than zomboid ever could
[2022-12-19 17:12:09] <kkefka> love you tommy
[2022-12-19 17:12:25] <leogutschow> Not only the loneliness, but the feeling of "I'm just waiting to die, there's nothing I can do to stop it"

[2022-12-19 17:12:33] <@%TheBjornen> best tiem with zomboid multiplayer is when people panic and chaos happens
[2022-12-19 17:12:34] <cchewiee> caravans are more worth it

[2022-12-19 21:07:38] <foxen1905> this game is creepy not Just the crime bit how easy for the police to shoot you as a covilian if something like this happend
[2022-12-19 21:08:02] <+scottish1900> Swat teams have killed a lot of hostages accidently
[2022-12-19 21:09:03] <!matty_2599> I‚Äôm ill in bed and been watching all the hogwarts game gameplay, looks insane I‚Äôm cautiously optimistic @tommykaylive
[2022-12-19 21:09:03] <pbertrand_dev> who are you mailing all the guns to
[2022-12-19 21:09:06] <+scottish1900> I know there was a massive hostage crisis in russia, and they tried to use gas to make them pass out, but a lot of civilians ended up suffocating
[2022-12-19 21:09:21] <BadgerTheStranger> i doubt that guys with guns would've gave up that easy in such a situation irl, but the game is a game, you know LUL

[2022-12-19 21:09:59] <foxen1905> we need some german guns..
[2022-12-19 21:10:32] <+scottish1900> Solo guys give up sometimes but the groups very rarely ever try to surrender peacefully unless they are negotiated to surrender
[2022-12-19 21:10:54] <+scottish1900> Once it is breach tho I don't think many people surrender when swat are entering lol I think it's  a bit late
