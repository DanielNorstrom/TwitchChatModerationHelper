[2022-12-15 17:22:49] <%+Toy_Soldier_x> @5howst0pper i just run some DMZ when i find a gun i like honestly bc i dont have MP

[2022-12-15 17:24:53] <%+Toy_Soldier_x> @5howst0pper yeah its def a lil all over the place. But my advice, if want a specific gun just find an AI in DMZ with it and extract. Youll unlock it nice and easy tht way!

[2022-12-15 17:27:27] <%+Toy_Soldier_x> I do like it. But the fact that there are gas masks kinda ruins it for me. So now only certain ppl getcto utilize zone

[2022-12-15 17:28:48] <%+HauntedPistachio> you cant tank zone really
[2022-12-15 17:28:59] <%Gratchinsson> people are complaining that you cant tank it
[2022-12-15 17:29:06] <%+Toy_Soldier_x> I wish that everyone started with 1 regular gas mask and that was all u ever get. No durable masks and no stacking them
[2022-12-15 17:29:14] <+Berger0> wooo some WZ 2.0 content. LFG
[2022-12-15 17:29:16] <Manpeckz> If your gas mask isn’t durable you may as well not be wearing it
[2022-12-15 17:29:17] <%Gratchinsson> im saying i think its a good thing
[2022-12-15 17:29:27] <Athanatossa> Gratchinsson We all agree'd the other way :)
[2022-12-15 17:29:27] <%Gratchinsson> @Toy_Soldier_x yeah, not a bad idea
[2022-12-15 17:29:29] <Prod3us> does it still do a damage increase with each zone reduction?
[2022-12-15 17:29:36] <jake6934> If you want to tank a zone, there is Apex or PUBG
[2022-12-15 17:29:50] <Prod3us> more deadly now
[2022-12-15 17:29:50] <+survivndaylight> Do you like this healing system that’s both warzones have had or blackout when you have to pick up bandages and heal
[2022-12-15 17:29:52] <+Berger0> @TSM_Viss any hot takes on the new WZ? Looting/movement/game pacing seem to be the biggest gripes people are having.
[2022-12-15 17:30:01] <%Gratchinsson> apex people became masters of tanking zone
[2022-12-15 17:30:03] <Prod3us> mask or dead

[2022-12-15 17:49:56] <%+Flamingcarrot01> siege was like that with a few guns
[2022-12-15 17:50:06] <%Tartug> Recoil is easy in this game. It's the visual recoil / muzzle flash that sometimes messes me up because you just can't see the target. This is with iron sites.
[2022-12-15 17:50:13] <%+Flamingcarrot01> better now though

[2022-12-15 22:11:54] <+turtl3pudding> @tsm_viss what do you think WZ having the first ring visible in drop? what if Apex did that? might make comp kinda crazy.
[2022-12-15 22:13:06] <%+Toy_Soldier_x> @turtl3pudding could b interesting, but generally speaking with Apex matches being smaller (in player count and map size) i feel like the games would get wierd. Everyone dropping in the same area and games being over in like 15min

[2022-12-15 22:16:09] <+turtl3pudding> @toy_soldier_x that is fair.
