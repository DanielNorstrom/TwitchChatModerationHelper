[2023-01-05 13:37:25] <%+Lady_Lorr> @barubasauro yeah that is what the call it and how they explain it, though you keep gained levels and found items magically in the future that you didn't have from the part until you remembered you had it so strimmer is correct about the logic part
[2023-01-05 13:37:49] <%Lonefellow> I never played the new version of this dungeon but as far as I can tell I would be meh about everything up to Cerberus and very hyped about everything after.
[2023-01-05 13:37:52] <barubasauro> so this is the actual timeline and what we played early in the game are noctis' memories @Lady_Lorr
[2023-01-05 13:37:55] <%AngaPeeters> just game logic
[2023-01-05 13:37:58] <%+Lady_Lorr> @neobullseye I was getting to that

[2023-01-05 13:51:20] <%spectr0nn> @Neobullseye agreed although tbh, replaying the game myself now and watching these streams, i can still feel its troubled development
[2023-01-05 13:51:21] <DaRealHizza> @Lonefellow i think jack is 30+ from strangers of paradis
[2023-01-05 13:51:31] <%Lonefellow> @DaRealHizza Mainline FFs I should say

[2023-01-05 13:52:04] <BerserkNow> stranger to paradise is mainline quality
[2023-01-05 13:52:12] <%AngaPeeters> Basch was supposed to be a protag, ain't he above 30?
[2023-01-05 13:52:14] <%Lonefellow> It would have been different if Basch stayed the MC in XII
[2023-01-05 13:52:25] <!%BlueSamy> How old was Celes in in World of Ruin? She's the protag of FF6 which is why I ask. endyeaSIP

[2023-01-05 13:53:05] <%+Lady_Lorr> @bluesamy she was like 18 and then it is a year so 19
[2023-01-05 13:53:07] <%spectr0nn> how may time passes between balance and ruin in FF6 anyway
[2023-01-05 13:53:14] <%TidusZecht> year
[2023-01-05 13:53:14] <%Kruggy> 1 year I think
[2023-01-05 13:53:15] <%Lonefellow> Although Terra is the face of VI, so I just consider her the protag

[2023-01-05 13:54:47] <%+Lady_Lorr> Either way. it is only a year and Terra and Celeste are both young

[2023-01-05 13:55:28] <%spectr0nn> @wee_wah i'm actually trying to get the hang of it now. the added tutorial definitely helped with that
[2023-01-05 13:55:49] <%Neobullseye> In FF6 in the World of Balance, Duane and Katarin (two NPCs in Mobliz) are explicitly stated to be "16 years old and in love". In the World of Ruin, which again is explicitly 1 year later, they would thus be 17... and Katarin is heavily preggers.
[2023-01-05 13:55:56] <%wee_wah> oh, they added a new tutorial?
[2023-01-05 13:55:57] <%Lonefellow> When I experimented with it, I discovered you could use Blizzaga and have it heal you, for example. THat's as far as I got
[2023-01-05 13:56:07] <!%BlueSamy> FFXV Magic - Have your teammates stand on top of one another then toss the magic. endyeaGRIN
[2023-01-05 13:56:09] <%+Lady_Lorr> @neobullseye correct

[2023-01-05 13:56:31] <%spectr0nn> @Neobullseye you could argue that FF6 is set in a time period where that would actually happen irl tho
[2023-01-05 13:57:23] <%Neobullseye> Oh, I'm not questioning it or calling it weird or whatever. It's just a thing that I completely glossed over the first few times I played the game.
[2023-01-05 13:57:32] <%spectr0nn> oh yeah you get that acc right from the start
[2023-01-05 13:57:47] <%spectr0nn> yep
[2023-01-05 13:57:49] <%wee_wah> yep
[2023-01-05 13:58:05] <%Lonefellow> I'm surprised magical friendly fire is a thing. IT's more realistic, sure, but more realistic isn't always more fun.

[2023-01-05 13:59:41] <%spectr0nn> @Lonefellow i clearly remember it was a thing in Baldur's Gate and other DnD based CRPGs, but those are very different games where you control all party members

[2023-01-05 14:00:46] <%Lonefellow> @spectr0nn Yeah, of course, but those are turn based grid games where you can always see the AoE of the magic/item you use. In an action game you can have party members enter that AoE on accident, for example

[2023-01-05 15:33:26] <%Neobullseye> FF15's main game is really short. It very obviously expects you to do all the sidequests.

[2023-01-05 16:03:52] <+Dayriu> no items in battle
[2023-01-05 16:03:53] <%Selnica> hardmode locks out items

[2023-01-05 16:04:05] <DaRealHizza> No items at all right not just in battle
[2023-01-05 16:04:09] <%Selnica> I kinda wish it didn't
[2023-01-05 16:04:15] <%oldandflexible> i ment you get all those potions from boxes and you can`t use them
[2023-01-05 16:04:16] <!%Ensatzuken> Yes, no items and no mana recovery on bench
[2023-01-05 16:04:21] <%IndecisiveNinja> yeah, i find it maddening though. 90% of chests and rewards are pointless when you can use items ever
[2023-01-05 16:04:22] <%EagleFalcon> BREAKING NEWS!!! Hard mode is hard. more at 11 MiniK
[2023-01-05 16:04:24] <%XyFreak> also no mp on bench
[2023-01-05 16:04:24] <%+Lady_Lorr> Hard mode is legit
[2023-01-05 16:04:40] <%Selnica> Iget that no item makes thigns harder which is the point,b ut I almost enver needed items in normal mode, so I kinda wish they'd have been made more needed in hardmode

[2023-01-05 16:05:15] <!%+yrvengalied> @Vinitus you have to think and strategize before just rushing head in and if you played normal mode (100%) then you can just rush in cause you already mastered the game by then
[2023-01-05 16:05:17] <%IndecisiveNinja> no point to selling when theres nothing to buy

[2023-01-05 16:09:14] <%$Aurien__> you're actually only about 40 hours ahead of last years FF15 time, so if you account for penance its not that much faster
[2023-01-05 16:09:22] <%+Lady_Lorr> in the normal you don't need the mp in the boxes and in hard mode you don't need the potions, it is great bggHaa
[2023-01-05 16:09:57] <%+yeroon> i pretty much used that weapon the moment i got it :)
[2023-01-05 16:10:26] <%XyFreak> iirc you get as many yellow materia as you want

[2023-01-05 16:11:11] <%spectr0nn> doesnt nailbat have big crits?
[2023-01-05 16:11:17] <%XyFreak> yes
[2023-01-05 16:11:20] <%+Lady_Lorr> cause kids need nailbats, duh
[2023-01-05 16:11:21] <%XyFreak> and a different stance
[2023-01-05 16:11:28] <!%Ensatzuken> Me that did all hard mode with buster blade cause balance is victory... sevenBlank
[2023-01-05 16:11:29] <%TidusZecht> yeah that's the main thing nail bat goes for
[2023-01-05 16:11:29] <%+Drakorious> im on the sidequest for nailbat lol
[2023-01-05 16:11:29] <%$Aurien__> i hated that stance
[2023-01-05 16:11:33] <%XyFreak> me too

[2023-01-05 16:11:50] <%Neobullseye> Cheer111 Now I have no idea about if treasures change at all in hard mode, but you know what would be hilarious? If a late-game chest casually gave you 99 Elixirs, making the played celebrate for a moment... only to remember you can't use items in Hard Mode XD
[2023-01-05 16:11:56] <%+Vinitus> yrvengalied true i mean sorry i didn't want to be mean. I tried my hm play with all my materias but still had very much trouble killing the bosses, until i looked up guides and tried that materia combos, but then after a while that just felt boring, cause you almost do no changes in materias or playing style, so i decided to play again like i want to now i stuck on Barret and Aerith against the Tank
[2023-01-05 16:12:00] <%$Aurien__> buster blade also has that iconic badass look

[2023-01-05 16:13:37] <%GanD988> no was in the OG too. the summons.

[2023-01-05 16:15:55] <%TidusZecht> I had to retry a couple of the bosses on hardmode once or twice but I had tons of fun with it. and I'll have to do it again once I play it on my ps5
[2023-01-05 16:16:00] <MagnumAF> does hard mode also mean new game plus?
[2023-01-05 16:16:07] <%$Aurien__> yes
[2023-01-05 16:16:09] <%IndecisiveNinja> Pretty much
[2023-01-05 16:16:10] <!%+yrvengalied> @MagnumAF yes
[2023-01-05 16:16:14] <%spectr0nn> yep
[2023-01-05 16:16:18] <%$Aurien__> hard mode is a balanced new game plus designed around being max level
[2023-01-05 16:16:29] <%+Vinitus> yrvengalied thanks, yeah i really need to get this play done, at least i played the DLC once but that was also a bit frsutrating, need more motivation on that again
[2023-01-05 16:16:30] <%+Lady_Lorr> @tiduszecht to get the plat you have to hear hell house three times on hard and I have done it twice bggS
[2023-01-05 16:16:31] <%IndecisiveNinja> It's new game + with some limits on materia
[2023-01-05 16:16:42] <%spectr0nn> @IndecisiveNinja and no items
[2023-01-05 16:16:47] <%TidusZecht> and if you're not max level when you start hard mode... you will by the end lol

[2023-01-05 16:17:51] <%$Aurien__> I think it would be neat if they balanced hard mode in part 2 so you can start it after part 1 if you have a hard mode clear
[2023-01-05 16:17:51] <!%rancid_> catJAM
[2023-01-05 16:17:58] <%IndecisiveNinja> i meant in new game + terms, where you can get everything again, ff7r still limits some of the materia you can buy, like chadley

[2023-01-05 16:31:16] <%AngaPeeters> probably yes @imfazekingslayer
[2023-01-05 16:31:28] <%+Drakorious> family time more important
[2023-01-05 16:31:31] <%spectr0nn> @ImFazeKingSlayer one does simply not vote against warm chicken
[2023-01-05 16:31:37] <%ImFazeKingSlayer> but microwaves
[2023-01-05 16:31:39] <%ImFazeKingSlayer> LUL
[2023-01-05 16:31:41] <%+JaymieGamer> i wanted the extra time i just joined
[2023-01-05 16:31:41] ~Stream offline~
[2023-01-05 16:31:42] <%AngaPeeters> ew
[2023-01-05 16:31:46] <%$Aurien__> microwave KFC?
[2023-01-05 16:31:49] <%EagleFalcon> ew... microwaved FKC is awful
[2023-01-05 16:31:55] <%+Drakorious> gotta cherish every moment with the little ones
[2023-01-05 16:31:55] <%AngaPeeters> microwaved kfc, it's a crime man
[2023-01-05 16:31:57] <%$Aurien__> at that point you might as well eat it cold
[2023-01-05 16:32:02] <+Debordes> microwave doesnt keep it crunchy
[2023-01-05 16:32:08] <%$Aurien__> its either hot and fresh, or cold the next day
[2023-01-05 16:32:16] <%+JaymieGamer> yuk i threw my microwave out.
[2023-01-05 16:32:23] <%AngaPeeters> anyway, I'm off, bye my friends o/
[2023-01-05 16:32:25] <%BoomBaybi> what's wrong with microwaving it? does it get soggy? (I can't eat anything fromKFC)
[2023-01-05 16:32:31] <%+JaymieGamer> i use air fryers
[2023-01-05 16:32:35] <%+Drakorious> it gets very soggy
[2023-01-05 16:32:36] <%EagleFalcon> air fryer or baking is the best way to reheat fried chicken, and even then, not the same as fresh
[2023-01-05 16:32:43] <%IndecisiveNinja> hey, i like cold kfc, still good
[2023-01-05 16:32:52] <%BoomBaybi> soggy chicken skin..... yuck
[2023-01-05 16:33:01] <%$Aurien__> seven comes back and goes wtf guys, you're still here talking about chicken?
[2023-01-05 16:33:05] <%$Aurien__> the streams over, go home
[2023-01-05 16:33:07] <%EagleFalcon> Cold KFC is good too, but still fresh is best
[2023-01-05 16:33:10] <%ImFazeKingSlayer> i dated girls with soggy chicken skin
[2023-01-05 16:33:45] <%EagleFalcon> so we're gonna go open up BGG's stream with unsolicited chatter about fried chicken, right?
[2023-01-05 16:33:48] <%+JaymieGamer> air fryers are better it dont create soggy, i warm my food up from a instant vortex 7 in one air fryer
[2023-01-05 16:34:06] <%+JaymieGamer> it makes things the way it should
[2023-01-05 16:34:17] <%+JaymieGamer> no soggyness at all
[2023-01-05 16:34:39] <%Neobullseye> @EagleFalcon Absolutely.
[2023-01-05 16:34:49] <%+JaymieGamer> so look up vortex instant 7 in one air fryer
[2023-01-05 16:34:49] <%$Aurien__> @EagleFalcon I can do that, for sure
[2023-01-05 16:34:54] <%ImFazeKingSlayer> what if i want something wet in my mouth?
[2023-01-05 16:35:07] <%$Aurien__> thats the best part
[2023-01-05 16:35:13] <%$Aurien__> if you want soggy microwaved chicken
[2023-01-05 16:35:16] <%$Aurien__> you can have it
[2023-01-05 16:35:19] <%$Aurien__> I'
[2023-01-05 16:35:27] <%$Aurien__> I'm not eating it, you do you boo boo
[2023-01-05 16:35:28] <%EagleFalcon> I'll hopefully be at my desk this afternoon to help with that
[2023-01-05 16:35:38] <%Neobullseye> @ImFazeKingSlayer bggLewd
[2023-01-05 16:37:13] <%+JaymieGamer> i replaced my microwave with airfryer i air fry my KFC chicken, it brings the crispy back
[2023-01-05 16:37:32] <%+JaymieGamer> @Aurien__
[2023-01-05 16:37:51] <%ImFazeKingSlayer> i didnt even know they had kfc outside of america
[2023-01-05 16:38:18] <%$Aurien__> airfryers are amazing
[2023-01-05 16:39:04] <%+JaymieGamer> @Aurien__ so look up instant vortex airfryer
[2023-01-05 16:39:08] <%ImFazeKingSlayer> can airfryers warm a pizza
[2023-01-05 16:39:17] <%ImFazeKingSlayer> otherwise microwave it is
[2023-01-05 16:41:06] <%+JaymieGamer> the instant vortext airfryer has bake and other settings also. @ImFazeKingSlayer @Aurien__ so look it up. And yes air fry pizza for 2 minutes to 5 it all depends
[2023-01-05 16:44:26] <%+JaymieGamer> later chat
