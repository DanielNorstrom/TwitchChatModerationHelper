[2023-01-06 22:39:24] <%EmFourThree> theres a hunter meme that hunters need everything because they can use everything
[2023-01-06 22:39:24] <%+Humain> But if you play survival you can't sharpen your bullets
[2023-01-06 22:40:01] <%+Humain> All that monster hunter will pay off
[2023-01-06 22:40:08] <%+Humain> sharpen your bullets like an absolute monster
[2023-01-06 22:40:23] <@%^StreamElements> Remember to save and stay hydrated @Auteru ^_^
