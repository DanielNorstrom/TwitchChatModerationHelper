[2023-01-10 17:27:26] <%Lyles_VT> When you place monsters of different types together in a single place it causes distrust and conflict and they attack each other.
[2023-01-10 17:27:29] <decaff_depresso> not the lava
[2023-01-10 17:27:37] <!%+AirahsELL> how enemies can fight each other: if enemy type A hits enemy type B theyll fight. if enemy type A hits a barrel next to another enemy type A theyll also fight, which they normally wont do.
[2023-01-10 17:27:37] <%Furudehan> Not that one.
