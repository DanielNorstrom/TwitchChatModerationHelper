[2023-01-03 01:45:59] <%+lordofmanyburgers> i think the most situational is pure damage, it is almost necessary for some enemies that have super high defence

[2023-01-03 01:46:08] <%HugBringer> Chrono crystals, combined with the river, sounds like that'd have interesting layout options

[2023-01-03 01:46:26] <KarraChr000> Guessing is a large part of the game...  Even in the game's wiki, people are unsure of some of the game's variables.

[2023-01-03 02:04:25] <%HugBringer> @Xel562 It only ever matters if you're attack/counter/dodge too much in combat
[2023-01-03 02:04:29] <$ghrymnyvek> But if you do counter I expect an apology

[2023-01-03 02:05:01] <%MMage09> stamina im guessing goes up with lvl, never really paid attention to it lol
[2023-01-03 02:05:17] <BirdOfChill> 81%. That's a lot of attack speed.
[2023-01-03 02:05:23] <%HugBringer> I think even Counter has an 'Animation' limiter. You can't counter infinitely fast

[2023-01-03 02:51:49] <%+enxxer> yeah. I'm struggling to follow but I like the game in general
[2023-01-03 02:51:50] <%HisGalacticEminence> I have pretty map and big numbers....am doing good
[2023-01-03 02:51:50] <FolgersInn> If it's anything like Diablo 2 the numbers are almost irrelevant and there are points where you attack speed breaks through to a lesser number of frames.
[2023-01-03 02:51:51] <%RIFFOSAURUS> number go up make unga bunga happy
[2023-01-03 02:51:53] <gazpancho> ratJAM
[2023-01-03 02:51:58] <%goody8727> high numbers good low numbers bad
[2023-01-03 02:51:59] <%+Quansto> I still dont understand some of the sounds that ding while I'm playing - but i love this game
[2023-01-03 02:52:03] <%pinfeldorf> Ok so do I have this right: this is like a Build Your Own Dungeon roguelike, and the combat is kind of like auto battling?
[2023-01-03 02:52:06] <%+zunath> I know what some of these words mean
[2023-01-03 02:52:09] <%RichMoney3315> bigger number better number
[2023-01-03 02:52:11] <%Hupsaurus> is this close to the end of the game?
[2023-01-03 02:52:23] <Khatun_> higher number game gooder
[2023-01-03 02:52:26] <%+Rei_N_Vaded> 75% is what I aim for with a decent chunk of attack speed
[2023-01-03 02:52:27] <%CoffeeBreathingDragon> final fantasy 14 has numbers. I've seen numbers when tofu played. it has many numbers Kappa
[2023-01-03 02:52:27] <$Newmatic> is the attack speed stat on the Necro for the skeletons?
[2023-01-03 02:52:36] <%Araragidono> been playing Brotato and Nobody Saves The World, pretty damn good stuff

[2023-01-03 02:52:40] <%broccolilly> @Newmatic it's for summon speed i think

[2023-01-03 02:52:58] <%$Chymondo> it seems, that the classes are not balanced well.. Necro is much more powerful as the warrior

[2023-01-03 05:03:49] <%Shekelford> Necro just feels a lot easier
[2023-01-03 05:03:52] <%aYoshiHunt> necro seems like easy mode

[2023-01-03 05:04:34] <%$azrael_dr> the warrior automatically increases his defense the longer a fight goes on, it's the class's ability.

[2023-01-03 05:05:58] <%$AsteriskX> poe too honestly
[2023-01-03 05:06:02] <%$MajorMeowMix> D2 is a sifting simulator. As someone who loves D2
[2023-01-03 05:06:02] <$kenguymandude> thats true for most of the items
[2023-01-03 05:06:03] <%mort459> lol thats literally the perfect description of d2
[2023-01-03 05:06:20] <%+kll21> the point is loot drops
[2023-01-03 05:06:22] <%+seedmole> Madge you play to find the challenge

[2023-01-03 05:06:30] <uniquename4> after 1million hours
[2023-01-03 05:06:33] <GuyMcBrofist> Yep, you're OP until you're not, then you fix your build
[2023-01-03 05:06:36] <%$Xel562> yeah it's not about challenge in D2
[2023-01-03 05:06:37] <%+seedmole> COPIUM the challenge really gets going around 200 hours
[2023-01-03 05:06:38] <%drkirienko> yall, don't argue with him about D2. he didn't enjoy. let it go
[2023-01-03 05:06:38] <KyleKatarn7> Where's the punch in the face when you play?
[2023-01-03 05:06:39] <%umbra00> classes dont really come together as a whole until like level 20-30 anyway, so it can be really boring even getting that far unless you are getting rushed

[2023-01-03 14:33:54] <%+GaimeGuy> Hard enough hit to the chest above the heart within like a 10 millisecond window (between beats) at just the right angle = heart stops

[2023-01-03 14:34:07] <%Seda_Give> vitals are normalized, but they need a breathing tube I think

[2023-01-03 14:34:24] <%feeniks0> @Sylamun He actually tackled someone else, even stranger

[2023-01-03 14:34:27] <%CarbonAxiom> Very likely some form of commotio cordis, which is sudden cardiac arrest from a strong hit
[2023-01-03 14:34:27] <%+PhoenoFox> He did the tackling
[2023-01-03 14:34:28] <%$Colburn0004> He was the tackler

[2023-01-03 14:34:56] <%TheMadMoxxie> I make batteries, lots and lots of batteries and when we think we're through you guessed it more batteries
[2023-01-03 14:35:08] <%feeniks0> I still feel like if CTE was diagnosable while alive, football would certainly have rule changes
[2023-01-03 14:35:08] <%+jkaz316> @corignis I played for 12 years, got me into a College I never would of gotten into on Grades Alone, and I will never let me kids sniff the field

[2023-01-03 14:35:21] <%CarbonAxiom> @corignis This is a widely shared sentiment, and probably the biggest indicator that football as it currently stands won't last for much longer
[2023-01-03 14:35:21] <%+Corking118> @jkaz316 100%. no kid of mine will EVER play football

[2023-01-03 14:36:41] <%CarbonAxiom> @feeniks0 The biggest reason why it will likely change despite all the money is that football doesn't have much growth left, as big as it is in the US. It has almost no international exposure, and likely won't get any as a long as it stays with its current rule set
[2023-01-03 14:36:45] <kr4nk> tbh though, other than being in a hospital already, it couldn't have happened in a better place. Wishing all the best

[2023-01-03 14:57:24] <%FunkyFritters> Agreed, and as far as I can tell. The game never tells you anything about them. you just aquire them.
[2023-01-03 14:57:24] <%sporkboots> part of the game is setting up your expedition deck so you get some of these resources since they only drop from certain things
[2023-01-03 14:57:24] <%+Blitzkrieg133> it trys to force you to use different cards and fight different stuff. almost too miuch

[2023-01-03 14:57:41] <%+GaimeGuy> it does get a little grindy but everyone also probably spends the first 20 hours of the game throwing away 70% of their resources because they don't know when to retreat

[2023-01-03 15:16:18] <doctor_hen_dogg> it was an F for us
[2023-01-03 15:16:19] <%$korbaton> depends on your grading scale
[2023-01-03 15:16:25] <%$qzcx> depends on the class

[2023-01-03 15:16:30] <+OVERM1ND> 65 was the cutoff
[2023-01-03 15:16:30] <%+UraniumQ33> incorrect 69 is NICE
[2023-01-03 15:16:30] <%$VinceAyne> 69 for the D, nice
[2023-01-03 15:16:30] <slm_k> "Sure! I guess..." hello barb
[2023-01-03 15:16:35] <%$korbaton> the old grading scale I had in middle school had it as an F, but nowadays it's a high D
[2023-01-03 15:16:37] <%kumakumaman> a lot of schools dont do D's anymore.  It goes straight from C to F
[2023-01-03 15:16:37] <%$Eddieg1230> D+
[2023-01-03 15:16:38] <%Sax_Therapy> Mornin all barbArise
[2023-01-03 15:16:38] <%+jwowillo> lmao what
[2023-01-03 15:16:41] <%FunkyFritters> It depends on your institution. If you're going for a professional certification a 69 is an F
[2023-01-03 15:16:43] <%$EternalHav0c> lower than a 70 was failing in my high school
[2023-01-03 15:16:43] <%+IdolizeDT> if you are on a 10 point scale it's a D, if it's an 8 point scale you're treading an F
[2023-01-03 15:16:46] <%Hurricane> for me anything above a 50 was a pass.
[2023-01-03 15:16:51] <%+floppie7th> D for us and in my SO's high school, F in both colleges she went to

[2023-01-03 15:16:57] <%$wroday> I had an insanely harsh professor whose grading scale was a 70 was an A
[2023-01-03 15:16:58] <%tenebrity> grade inflation is real, too.
[2023-01-03 15:17:00] <%theEntropic> 65 - 70 = D, below 65 = F
[2023-01-03 15:17:03] <%+CowTippa6> C's get Degrees
[2023-01-03 15:17:03] <%+WhiskeyWood> They don‚Äôt even do letter grades here anymore.  1-4
[2023-01-03 15:17:05] <%+GiraffeKiller> Good morning, folks.
[2023-01-03 15:17:06] <NoobLearninGame> pugPls
[2023-01-03 15:17:06] <%AflacGoose> pretty sure 60-69 is C, 70-79 - B, 80+ A
[2023-01-03 15:17:07] <dee_dianne> In my university 60-70 is a D but some courses mandate C or higher to pass
[2023-01-03 15:17:15] <%Fandango101> It certainly is from my perspective
[2023-01-03 15:17:17] <%+donutsforthewin> That's just grading on a curve without changing the numbers
[2023-01-03 15:17:17] <eatingpotatoes25> chapter 3 or 4?
[2023-01-03 15:17:22] <%Missing_Node> @WhiskeyWood My daughter is in first grade and this is how she's graded.
[2023-01-03 15:17:25] <+graffitirooster> 65 or below was an F for us. 66 - 79 was a D. 70 - 80 C and so on.
[2023-01-03 15:17:28] <%theEntropic> @AflacGoose what kind of insane grading scale is this? and why can't i have been a part of it
[2023-01-03 15:17:28] <cohall_> Omg we also used to prank call with the Arnold Schwarzenegger sound board!
[2023-01-03 15:17:37] <cohall_> Good memories

[2023-01-03 15:22:57] <JustSmileMan_o7> @Toasticus Desert until -99.5% HP and nothing but spiders everywhere with vampire mansions and amulet unlocked for magic HP means you get to loop 200 or 300 before RNG makes the spiders dodge enough in a row to oneshot you.

[2023-01-03 15:42:07] <dommmooo> is there a reason why you are saving up certain cards like the groves?
[2023-01-03 15:42:07] <%MMage09> it make less favorable placements on stuff

[2023-01-03 16:15:57] <%$jimbobsandwich> you might as well start with eldenring, you're gonna die a lot either way. might as well enjoy the up to date gameplay/graphics
[2023-01-03 16:15:59] <+RetroMakoStar> well fromsoftware started with tenchu no?
[2023-01-03 16:16:01] <%+darkart800> it's interesting some of the arguments that Elden ring did not deserve GoTY revolve around how punishing it is to new players and a lack of a tutorial
[2023-01-03 16:16:11] <%get_the_mail> the older souls will feel super fast paced compared to elden ring
[2023-01-03 16:16:12] <%retrofox_13> Yea but if you play elden ring first, it kinda ruins the 1st couple games. At least it did for me

[2023-01-03 16:21:00] <%$jimbobsandwich> @barbarousking so the minimal heat required to get the true final ending is like 18-20ish right? do you get any special cutscenes/lore for more heat?
[2023-01-03 16:21:08] <%+lopinzonk> The QOL improvements in Elden Ring are huge compared to Dark Souls, but Im glad Iplayed DS1 first
[2023-01-03 16:21:09] <%$Scoutyx> which God is the worst overall? or are they all potentially viable?

[2023-01-03 16:21:24] <%+noober09> "sometimes" zeus fucks off the rest of the run
[2023-01-03 16:21:29] <%missilechion> you don't need any heat for true ending i think
[2023-01-03 16:21:29] <%$mordborne> @Nigidius than is great bc he pauses the timer. basically a free room
[2023-01-03 16:21:29] <%+BougiePower> Jolted + non expiration of Jolted makes a huge difference at Hades
[2023-01-03 16:21:31] <%barrythechopper_> @jimbobsandwich heat doesn't affect the story

[2023-01-03 17:42:37] <tommy_boba> t can be easily shown that at the end of the algorithm, S contains the itemsets of TopKFI(T, K) and their supports. As an example, let us see how Q and S evolve in the first 3 iterations of the algorithm, when applied to the dataset shown before to compute TopKFI(T, 5). For simplicity we depict Q as a unsorted list. Note that the usual alphabetical ordering for the items is assumed

[2023-01-03 18:46:00] <MarvinOGravel> Contra games are always BS
