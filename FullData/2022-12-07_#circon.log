[2022-12-07 14:44:50] <%+TheBritishMonster> tarkov gets insane views on wipe day
[2022-12-07 14:45:06] VIEWERS: 749
[2022-12-07 14:45:42] <Suchtortoise> I'm guessing tarkov is more intense
[2022-12-07 14:45:48] <@%+CM1994> Thing is, there's SO many people out there who want to see gameplay. Those are often lurkers too.
[2022-12-07 14:45:53] <Suchtortoise> which is more interesting
[2022-12-07 14:46:00] <Mata1997> yeah but tarkov is so much more intense
[2022-12-07 14:46:15] <@%+CM1994> So a game with a lot of down-time, that doesn't help keep the folks who just want constant gameplay happy.
[2022-12-07 14:46:22] <%+Tom4szek> @Circon Circon have you checked that band Iperyt? :)
[2022-12-07 14:46:37] <+DQ_Creative> I have 600h in Tarkov, gave me brain damage worse than WoT
[2022-12-07 14:46:54] <%Gavnixs> Yea I also do not understand why people watch Tarkov
[2022-12-07 14:46:55] <%+TheBritishMonster> i just like watching the really good players wreck noobs in tarkov
[2022-12-07 14:47:06] VIEWERS: 749
[2022-12-07 14:47:07] <itslowj> feel like tarkov people are more invested to seeing if someone survives the raid/dies or finds something crazy the stakes are higher

[2022-12-07 14:48:18] <%giant_noob> Tarkov is just inventory streams. Watching people moving stuff around

[2022-12-07 14:52:28] <+DQ_Creative> It's a ruthless game
[2022-12-07 14:52:39] <+DQ_Creative> The Cycle: Frontier is a more forgiving Tarkov I guess
[2022-12-07 14:52:47] <+DQ_Creative> And new CoD DMZ is actually quite fun
