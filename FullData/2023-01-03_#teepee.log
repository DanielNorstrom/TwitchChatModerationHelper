I know sprint to fire / anything to fire is super slow in this game, but I see folks, mainly streamers, be able to get up immediately from a dolphin dive where as I feel like I have to dolphin dive —> crouch—>standing—> gun up (finally).

[2023-01-03 16:13:18] <GreekoIV> but yet again they didn't "upgrade" as much.. waiting for the resurgence as always

[2023-01-03 16:14:21] <@%^Streamlabs> TeeP has always played Warzone on PC. Typically he plays with a controller, but switches to MKB often to keep the game feeling new. He made the switch to PC for better frames and better FOV | - !ibp | - !specs | for more info | #sponsored |
[2023-01-03 16:14:29] <+roxsoo_> If they go back in time AGAIN for the next major update, I will officially be done with the COD franchise forever. I am so nervous about that
[2023-01-03 16:14:29] <@%Hyperbeam__> @roadratt this is better than caldera
[2023-01-03 16:14:33] <%+emptyspyder> My opinion is Blackout released at the wrong time, if it would have came out after the BR wave i think it would have been successful

[2023-01-03 18:06:46] <+jispin> I can't prove it but I think velocity has alot to do with fall damage so the faster your falling the more likely you break your legs
