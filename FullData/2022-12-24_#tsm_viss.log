[2022-12-24 16:56:11] <%+natelols> Doing a lot of cleans?
[2022-12-24 16:56:12] <%hazardous_waste24> Forearm splints are similar to shin splints, but occur in your arms. This occurs when tendons, joints, and connective tissue gets strained from overuse.
[2022-12-24 16:56:20] <+GringoSuave619> @LurchyPooh take a week of rest, go to a doctor to check it out

[2022-12-24 16:56:42] <+LurchyPooh> @TSM_Viss could be from curls honestly

[2022-12-24 16:58:22] <+jonjones12to6> I've had something that felt like splints my forearms from overtraining with bicep curls. Just layer off the curls a bit and the splint feeling went away. Legit felt like pain in around the bones and joints in my forearms.
[2022-12-24 16:58:39] <%Leoslice> @LurchyPooh Sometimes the forearm near the elbow is because you over lifted and maybe hyper extended the elbow joint

[2022-12-24 17:15:15] <%+drstranglove> @Ninj4doggy It's a user defined term that is different for everyone.  Many peopl use it classify other people into little boxes.  I am just different, dude, and I enjoy being different.  So, I don't fit anyone's self imposed notion of what normal is.
