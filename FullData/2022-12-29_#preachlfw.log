[2022-12-29 10:24:12] <+trestin3> it has a chance as long as it was not on while wet
[2022-12-29 10:24:13] <+paxetluxgaming> @Dev_Nights He has a fair point, it went through multiple days of water exposure the rice trick would work if it was relatively soon but not in this condition.
[2022-12-29 10:24:13] <%Agro1969> @Preachlfw cameras are very bad with water - they're vulnerable to something called lens mould which can ruin them - it may not be apparent how bad the damage is.
[2022-12-29 10:24:14] <%Dranni21312> @Preachlfw is the landlord (or their insurance) going to assume any liability for your damaged stuff and compensate you?

[2022-12-29 10:24:49] <+weird_pumpkin> I hope you have good insurance. As a former insurance agent (not UK)... even the rescue operation should be refundable)

[2022-12-29 10:32:52] <%$Pofferd> The finish was meh, but the rest of the race has been really fun
[2022-12-29 10:32:53] <%Miss_Kas> NODDERS
[2022-12-29 10:32:55] <%+SupoxFlytrap> even with the nerf, echo were much better, max himself recognized that
[2022-12-29 10:32:58] <%+Juskr> it was bad but echo were ahead imo so this kind of takes away from their win sadly Sadge
[2022-12-29 10:32:59] <+Yertle4> Nerfs are a core part of the WoW raiding experience at every level
[2022-12-29 10:33:04] <%Quickfirex4> so many people got so mad at the nerf
[2022-12-29 10:33:05] <%ravenribb> liquid killed it 4h after nerf, Echo on next pull. Enough said
[2022-12-29 10:33:05] <%Zziggz> Liquid still took hours to kill the boss even after the nerf
[2022-12-29 10:33:06] <IkkisFTW> the nerf wasn't the biggest factor too, echo was almost 1 pull away anyways
[2022-12-29 10:33:07] <%USAFace666> @preachlfw thoughts on how the kill pull was seemingly out of no where after it was like 2 hours of dumb mistakes
[2022-12-29 10:33:11] <%Dschonathan> Did you watch BDGG vs Method?
[2022-12-29 10:33:11] <%+jhazor> liquid took 4 hours to kill it after the final nerf - its very clear echo were ahead
[2022-12-29 10:33:12] <%Sphexator> Echo was on path to kill that day
[2022-12-29 10:33:13] <%turtleandfish> bah, that whole nerf is na fans saying that it was unfair bc the timing favoured echo
[2022-12-29 10:33:13] <%+toveck15> @Preachlfw please be careful when plugging in waterlogged electronics
[2022-12-29 10:33:16] <monosapiens2231> Did you watch the 6.3 Live Letter?
[2022-12-29 10:33:18] <%MolotovN> In the end, it was dogshit. Whats a race that needs to be nerfed all the time and is 5 days gearing with 5 days actual raiding?
[2022-12-29 10:33:32] <%+Duduu26> The boss was borked at the start that's for sure, bad boss to end on tbh
[2022-12-29 10:33:35] <+toobored> echo is just too good not even in the same realm lmao

[2022-12-29 10:33:43] <LasyPanda> The Whining after Echo kill kind of ruined the moment, lost all respect to Liquid
[2022-12-29 10:33:44] <%+Juskr> yeah I heard 1.5 as well, idk where it came from
[2022-12-29 10:33:51] <%ravenribb> Liquid didn't get out of bed coz they stayed way way late didn't they ?
[2022-12-29 10:33:51] <Critzor> Max said it

[2022-12-29 10:33:55] <ratskyz> was Towlie that said that

[2022-12-29 10:33:57] <%Zziggz> Max tweeted that lol
[2022-12-29 10:33:59] <+Mitune> Max is the one who said it
[2022-12-29 10:33:59] <Dev_Nights> if it's on the internet it must be true
[2022-12-29 10:34:00] <%+Tipuz> Max said it on stream

[2022-12-29 10:34:06] <%+Collected1> oh yeah Towelliee said it was in a discord
[2022-12-29 10:34:08] <rosina_scarlett> Scripe said something on his stream an hour and a half before the nerf. saying blizzard said a Nerf was coming
[2022-12-29 10:34:08] <%Komly> max said....it got done 2 hours before they started raiding
[2022-12-29 10:34:09] <@%Enoz___> it came from towlee. i think he's bullshit ting as usual
[2022-12-29 10:34:16] <+neahao> Max said it on stream when he went live
[2022-12-29 10:34:17] <%Komly> not that they knew it for 2 hours
[2022-12-29 10:34:20] <Regisin691> but there is only truth on the internet, ofc its true Kappa
[2022-12-29 10:34:21] <+xConstantine1337x> I mean Liquid took hours to kill it after the nerf, so I doubt it would have mattered
[2022-12-29 10:34:26] <%ravenribb> @Enoz___ that man KEKW
[2022-12-29 10:34:26] <%turtleandfish> @LasyPanda important to note that the twitter complaints were from fans, not the liquid raiders
[2022-12-29 10:34:26] <%+knukles0> do you think though the timing of the nerf was the right time as, for echo it was evening and liquid would have been the morning
[2022-12-29 10:34:32] <%MolotovN> Nah they were up 2 hours before the nerf
[2022-12-29 10:34:34] <%MaximumDRG> to be fair they are in the same tme zone as blizzard and were sleeping at 10am the  day before xmas. thats playing with fire @Preachlfw

[2022-12-29 10:34:40] <rosina_scarlett> @Enoz___ Nah it was from a dono on towelliees stream

[2022-12-29 10:35:00] <%realnzall> @Preachlfw What's your opinion on a hypothetical fixed time of day when Blizzard may nerf bosses the next tier?
[2022-12-29 10:35:01] <%Kanyusi> isnt that the standard wow cycle?
[2022-12-29 10:35:02] <%voldar_fumbledink> It had only mattered if Liquid killed it right away after starting, but they needed 3 hours
[2022-12-29 10:35:03] <+Yertle4> What's the last endboss that wasn't nerfed multiple times?
[2022-12-29 10:35:13] <+Mitune> I am disappointed in blizz trying to arms race again with those buffs initially
[2022-12-29 10:35:14] <golgin_> Was it relatively worse then last RWF nerfs?

[2022-12-29 10:35:53] <%Komly> @Preachlfw max said the nerf was 2 hours before they started raiding that day. Not that they knew it happening 2 hours before hand. And even if they did they wouldnt be able to all of a sudden rush to the venue to start raiding cuz they were sleeping
[2022-12-29 10:36:04] <Lyssa_Little_Bear> it's wild, being a FFXIV fan, seeing the massive nerfs to the dragon got, the response to those, and comparing it to the nerfs that P8S got and the kerfuffle there.
[2022-12-29 10:36:08] <Layercake> If Liquid knew 2 hours before and still didn't immediately started raiding it's they own fault, that's why it sounds bulshit
[2022-12-29 10:36:10] <%MolotovN> @cerolith Yeah WHERE THE FUCK are the actual TESTERS?
[2022-12-29 10:36:11] <+Mitune> I mean how much is the fight going to be nerfed going forward because most average mythic guilds are going to have huge troubles

[2022-12-29 10:36:18] <%turtleandfish> @realnzall @ravenribb is right, plus there is no good fixed time, due to time zone differences, and essentially the working hours of blizzard
[2022-12-29 10:36:22] <%+Mak2349> It was so weird. It felt like half a boss at the end
[2022-12-29 10:36:25] <%cerolith> They need an in house raid team

[2022-12-29 10:36:43] <Sabalon6174> Max said that even if they woke up and immediately left, they wouldnt have even been raiding by the time the race was over

[2022-12-29 10:40:28] <%$Azikielboi> @Preachlfw liquid thought the nerf would be way smaller
[2022-12-29 10:40:31] <%Thefatkid145> and stop launching raids in fucking December

[2022-12-29 11:09:54] <%Sphexator> Casters could do community raids bundled with raiders to cope with the splits

[2022-12-29 11:10:10] <%Tossberg> Was fun hearing the casting and the chat during splits so I didnt mind

[2022-12-29 11:10:34] <lionlurks> Chat, i keep getting small stream freeze ups. Is this a twitch issue or do any of you have an idea of what could cause it? been like this for a few weeks

[2022-12-29 11:11:00] <Narva95> splits was worse this time cause they release mythic same time as everything else so its wasnt befor the race start

[2022-12-29 11:58:28] <Lyonidus> echo always crushes liquid's stream
[2022-12-29 11:58:29] <%Sphexator> Liquids stream is just Max
[2022-12-29 11:58:31] <%+Juskr> Oh why did they mute their coms? any reason given?

[2022-12-29 11:58:33] <golgin_> Seems like Echo is making their RWF a must watch quality and entertainment wise
[2022-12-29 11:58:33] <%$Azikielboi> liquids viewers is massively siphoned by max though
[2022-12-29 11:58:34] <Saitouakira> you destroyed liquid cause you were on it NODDERS
[2022-12-29 11:58:35] <mostluckydan> yes chef
[2022-12-29 11:58:37] <%doimos89> same as blizzard + echo crushed liquid in the race :D

[2022-12-29 11:58:50] <%Elydian> Yeh, Max's stream leechs from the Liquid stream a lot.
[2022-12-29 11:58:53] <%+Juskr> @pringlez91 jinxed it, im blaming you for anything bad from now on Madge
[2022-12-29 11:58:58] <%$Azikielboi> like 90% of liquids casters watch the palyers, its not really comparable
[2022-12-29 11:59:00] <Timo4650> Working with Liquid? Traitor Madge
[2022-12-29 11:59:00] <%ralgrado> @varchon that’s why he left mid cast

[2022-12-29 11:59:12] <%Sphexator> Everyone does, the main broadcast is kinda useless for Liquid
[2022-12-29 11:59:12] <Funderik> their main channel was so dull and boring, sorry it was like a morning breakfast show.
[2022-12-29 11:59:13] <%+OrdinaryOlly> The liquid main show is so sleeper

[2022-12-29 11:59:20] <Timo4650> Yes chef!
[2022-12-29 11:59:22] <+mneYEP> yea max usually tops the rwf streams so it hurts their main channel lol

[2022-12-29 12:00:07] <%+Umseslad> You wouldn't be casting then Mike, you'd be busy petting Max's dogs and eating chef Heidi's food

[2022-12-29 12:00:11] <golgin_> Echo know you get in viewers all by yourself as well
[2022-12-29 12:00:15] <%turtleandfish> i didnt like the fact that max's and liquid's viewer numbers were on par with each other, like, shouldnt the main stream get more views?

[2022-12-29 12:00:52] <%Mydw1nter> Liquid's cast feels a bit too bland, I guess? Echo's cast always feels like a perfect blend between professionalism and friendship, and that's great from an audience perspective. @Preachlfw
[2022-12-29 12:00:55] <%KaiZen2048> You are very strangely tied to water and/or anything underwater themed.

[2022-12-29 12:12:12] <%valtari02> my unit is on a farm, can confirm owner is super greedy.
[2022-12-29 12:12:15] <%cgb_spender> too many rats
[2022-12-29 12:12:19] <+richpinn> farmers need that cash
[2022-12-29 12:12:23] <%Assirra> Farm next to the pub
[2022-12-29 12:12:24] <+GazXIII> Farm and build a side building as an office. Perfect scenario
[2022-12-29 12:12:28] <hal0_x> Preach!!! What is this game called!?

[2022-12-29 12:12:37] <%kazurath> I'm glad this sounds like a just a rough hit, but not a critical "we might be screwed" situation.
[2022-12-29 12:12:38] <%+FafferUK> Farmers always wanting more subsidies while they all drive around in range rovers
[2022-12-29 12:12:40] <%+Malkalen> My family is mostly farmers, they tend to be asset rich and cash poor so they need to squeeze their cash incomes where they can

[2022-12-29 12:12:49] <+sirf4ce> Would the pub idea not facilitate the "always at work" mode?
