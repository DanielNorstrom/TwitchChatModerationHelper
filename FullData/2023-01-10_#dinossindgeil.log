[2023-01-10 13:50:57] <%+cirillios> Basically because their mod requires you to pay for their mod with Patreon their endangering the whole mod community. FromSoft allows mods but asking for money for them could be a problem for everyone

[2023-01-10 13:52:52] <%+cirillios> So modding is technically illegal, but FromSoft allows it because it's good for the brand and doesn't take money from them. The idea is that if people are charging for mods that's a more egregious violation of intellectual property.

[2023-01-10 14:15:02] <%actingvictor> supposedly, i think he gave it too someone else

[2023-01-10 14:15:22] <+alexcon18> the second pig he bought because the first got depressed
[2023-01-10 14:15:22] <%+unagiro> he could have had the decency to eat the poor guy at least
[2023-01-10 14:15:38] <%actingvictor> should of done a better job at vetting who he gave it too, so still his fault
[2023-01-10 14:15:55] <+notMyrtle> he wanted a mini pig but then abandoned it when he realised it was a big one

[2023-01-10 14:17:30] <+alexcon18> not sure how trustworthy the sources are, but apparently he might have sold the two pigs on separate farmers, which is fucked up since the sole reason he bought the second was because the first got depressed. apparently pigs are very simpathetic creatures which makes it worse

[2023-01-10 14:23:48] <%actingvictor> i think it just depends on intentions, like did he want if for clout and discard the pig without a second thought, or did he find a new home for the animal he legitimately  thought was good? The obvious problem is how tf do we trust anything logan says at this point?

[2023-01-10 14:56:13] <cubby2tone> all achievements in ER is basically just beating the game 6 times

[2023-01-10 14:56:13] <%foxxx0> yeah, ER plat is not really much

[2023-01-10 15:17:59] <%$Khaas_> @foxxx0 There are A LOT of amazing exclusives. And also, 30FPS gaming never killed anybody. It's not bad.
[2023-01-10 15:18:02] <%Transcience1> The lower the framerate, the longer you can appreciate each individual grame
[2023-01-10 15:18:06] <%+Gosfi> @bigboyjohnhardon ocarina of time playing at 15fps most of the time GIGACHAD
[2023-01-10 15:18:09] <%$TyranosaurusBrett> @ComradeWilson I've played at 1 fps and it is soooo disorienting
[2023-01-10 15:18:21] <%ComradeWilson> @TyranosaurusBrett but you know everything happening in your 1 frame Ok
[2023-01-10 15:18:24] <%foxxx0> if you're otherwised used to 120fps+ games on a 144hz monitor ... then it is really painful. I'm already struggling with ER a bit due to the 60fps lock Sadge
[2023-01-10 15:18:27] <%actingvictor> 1 FPS would just be constant input lag no?

[2023-01-10 15:21:51] <%$Khaas_> You're not allowed to play bingo if you're younger than 65. It's the law.
[2023-01-10 15:21:51] <%$raithian25> i think Bingo is hard to "jump into" as a viewer. all the squares usually have a meaning that isn't clear without someone explaining
[2023-01-10 15:21:59] <oppai_o> they added weapon/mechanic for the game just for PVP that affects PVE
[2023-01-10 15:21:59] <Fenlast> they separated pvp and pve stuff they said
[2023-01-10 15:22:06] <%pay_87> now they changed it I think so that SP and MP are separate entities but before it wasn't like that
[2023-01-10 15:22:06] <%+unagiro> just play on build 1.0 pay Hmmm

[2023-01-10 18:35:16] <%CaptainUncomfortable> PS3 emulator barely works unfortunately.
[2023-01-10 18:35:20] <%actingvictor> thats how hard it was to work with that code base
[2023-01-10 18:35:21] <%CaptainUncomfortable> at least last I checked

[2023-01-10 18:36:02] <!%noxifoxi> @actingvictor what do you mean? playing games with RPCS3 is possible for years already
[2023-01-10 18:36:04] <+Ornstein98> Feel like I only want to emulate games I'll never be able to play again without an emulator
[2023-01-10 18:36:07] <Breadcrumbs85> @CaptainUncomfortable RPCS3 has made big steps forward and even stuff like MGS4 is playing reletively stable :O but you need a monster rig
[2023-01-10 18:36:11] <Breadcrumbs85> But its progress
[2023-01-10 18:36:16] <%wonderboyz27> But did you ever play a sega master system  ?
[2023-01-10 18:36:32] <%actingvictor> yeah but not all @noxifoxi confirmed like a week ago all games now run
[2023-01-10 18:36:47] <%CaptainUncomfortable> I have dolphin and can play wii games just fine with third party sensor bar
[2023-01-10 18:36:48] <%Secret_Berzerker> oui oui
[2023-01-10 18:36:51] <!%noxifoxi> @actingvictor ah yeah, all games boot now
[2023-01-10 18:37:01] <%+Ygramull> for sure you can emulate wii
[2023-01-10 18:37:02] <+Ornstein98> Games like MGS1 that aren't immediately available unless you purchase a ps3 and use the store
[2023-01-10 18:37:22] <%+Ygramull> I'm emulating it on my Steam Deck
[2023-01-10 18:37:25] <%Secret_Berzerker> greetings DinoChad and Dinolings

[2023-01-10 18:37:36] <Breadcrumbs85> Its not the same for every game/platform but legally speaking if you own the game and the hardware you have the right to play the game. Backing up your games digitially is legal and playing them with emulators is but streaming them im not sure about
[2023-01-10 18:37:40] <%+Ygramull> same with the switch KEKW
[2023-01-10 18:37:44] <PotatoShrimpi> Switch can be emulated
[2023-01-10 18:37:45] <%AsherCanid> dinossHK
[2023-01-10 18:37:52] <StrawHatFleet> wish we got more of this in Elden Ring
[2023-01-10 18:38:08] <%CaptainUncomfortable> are you allowed to use emulators on twitch? maybe this is a dumb question..
[2023-01-10 18:38:09] <Breadcrumbs85> Yah ive seen BOTW emulated and it looked good, the water lighting was a bit off but not game breaking at all

[2023-01-10 18:38:16] <!%noxifoxi> it's crazy, switch emulation was possible just a few weeks after launch KEKWait

[2023-01-10 18:38:22] <InitialDVolvo> @dinossindgeil So I bought Divinity 2 over xmas for my girlfriend as neither of us had ever played it before...  Really fun game.   Suddenly realized where your music was coming from LUL    She had no idea what it was at first but has really gotten into it.
[2023-01-10 18:38:34] <%actingvictor> @noxifoxi yeah your right, all at least boot, crazy how bad the ps3 was to build with
[2023-01-10 18:38:41] <%+Ygramull> The new Pokemon ran better on an emulator than the switch KEKW
[2023-01-10 18:38:52] <%general_ll30nn> divinity is amazing hill10Nice
[2023-01-10 18:39:01] <InitialDVolvo> Yea it's like DND
[2023-01-10 18:39:02] <Breadcrumbs85> @CaptainUncomfortable Super grey area. Legally you have the right to play the games you own on the hardware you own and emulation with your own BIOS is legal. But streaming it adds another layer of complication, each studio and platform could have their own issues
[2023-01-10 18:39:11] <InitialDVolvo> It's a refreshing change compared to normal games
[2023-01-10 18:39:21] <InitialDVolvo> she likes turn based, too

[2023-01-10 18:42:20] <InitialDVolvo> I thought you had to take four but now that I think about it, I guess you can actually take as little as you want?
