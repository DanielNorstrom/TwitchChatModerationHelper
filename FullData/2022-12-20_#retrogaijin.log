[2022-12-20 12:56:18] <Affles001> there is also a minimum amount of paint needed on warhammer mini's
[2022-12-20 12:56:32] <deadwarfare_x> haha taking the bizz away from them  and yes exactly make em cheaper
[2022-12-20 12:56:33] <@%$Xiph1987> Hasbro and Wizards of the Coast, yeah
[2022-12-20 12:56:33] <%Shivalla> I actually love WHFRPG, as a PnP.
[2022-12-20 12:56:41] <@%$Xiph1987> wait, i'm thinking of magic
[2022-12-20 12:56:44] <HottKarl> Everything being made in UK is a huge reason is so expensive
[2022-12-20 12:56:47] <%Shivalla> more than 40k on miniatures
[2022-12-20 12:56:48] <Soracaz> like actually what the fuck are they gonna do lmao. once 3d printing is affordable i aint buying SHIT that's made of plastic
[2022-12-20 12:56:52] <HottKarl> Its so expensive*
[2022-12-20 12:56:57] <@%$Xiph1987> but Wizards of the Coast are also fucking greedy
[2022-12-20 12:57:08] <VrtniPatuljak> not any cheaper in eu

[2022-12-20 12:57:27] <SeanHubLive> I live in the UK, warhammer is crazy expensive here still
[2022-12-20 12:57:35] <deadwarfare_x> its only logical that anyone would ask their friend with a printer to do it
[2022-12-20 12:58:01] <HottKarl> I knoww , i mean producing in the UK cost alot more than making it in china. Thats why the lrice is so high. Even if yiu are in UK

[2022-12-20 15:15:21] <+scottish1900> Barbs can throw a throwing axe, but the damage is so tiny
[2022-12-20 15:15:33] <%TurtleExpress> I think they should add more counterplay instead of more bullshit
[2022-12-20 15:15:37] <+scottish1900> Javelins would be nice, that potentially pin targets or slow them down a lot

[2022-12-20 15:15:55] <%Tal_lovesbuns> the throwing axe slows
[2022-12-20 15:15:58] <VrtniPatuljak> maybe axe for runners
[2022-12-20 15:15:59] <+scottish1900> I killed one ranger that was running, he was very very low health
[2022-12-20 15:16:07] <+scottish1900> THe axe does slow but not much
[2022-12-20 15:16:22] <+scottish1900> It slows as much as any other hit, but the damage is small so the slow is very short duration
[2022-12-20 15:16:32] <+Tekamthi> how about a skateboard so you can just roll up on the rangers fast

[2022-12-20 16:03:23] <%+TheTalkingPotato> @RetroGaijin I hope you are doing well sir
[2022-12-20 16:03:43] <%DonyWahlberg> @WildJokerr This is way less of a problem like this week because you can refinance at basically any time and prices have come down enough to offset the inflation
[2022-12-20 16:04:03] <%DonyWahlberg> Yardwork can be fun. I do all the mowing then garden as a reward and keep things looking pretty

[2022-12-20 16:04:34] <FeijoaSmoothie> I think gardens are way better than lawns
[2022-12-20 16:04:37] <FeijoaSmoothie> lawns suck

[2022-12-20 16:04:53] <%WildJokerr> Idk where you‚Äôre at that prices have come down. They are still going up @donywahlberg and remember the prices aren‚Äôt as honest with investments groups out buying regular buyers.

[2022-12-20 16:05:27] <%DonyWahlberg> @WildJokerr I literally signed on a house 20K below it's listing from earlier in the year :P It's definitely varying state to stat but I basically made our seller break even at his buy cost
[2022-12-20 16:05:27] <FeijoaSmoothie> plus when you got a drought lawns do nothing to retain water

[2022-12-20 16:05:59] <%DonyWahlberg> The market is at a point that people who bought in 2022 to flip are now losing money in a lot of areas, because their cost to purchase was already inflated
[2022-12-20 16:06:18] <BakaBryanBC> I think those were the guys i saw
[2022-12-20 16:06:39] <%WildJokerr> @donywahlberg you sure they just didn‚Äôt over price it and did that on purpose? An in all honesty 20k isn‚Äôt much when it comes to buying a house. That‚Äôs like 50/60 on your mortgage.

[2022-12-20 16:07:19] <%DonyWahlberg> @WildJokerr It's all public records, our seller paid 220K, cheapest sale price in the street was ~190K in 2020. So he priced it 250+ and we got it for ~230, just under
[2022-12-20 16:07:34] <%DonyWahlberg> He is basically losing money after he pays the fees and realtor
[2022-12-20 16:07:45] <%DonyWahlberg> Spent 220K to make like $2,000 lol
[2022-12-20 16:08:04] <ligeITrussen22> :(
[2022-12-20 16:08:15] <Dopefishy> hello dude how are you

[2022-12-20 16:08:32] <+gaxarovrc> Damn
[2022-12-20 16:08:37] <%WildJokerr> Sounds like the person was in a bad way and you got a nice find. Also at your price point that‚Äôs a pretty inexpensive house. That would be the cost of a 1bed room apartment near me @donywahlberg
[2022-12-20 16:08:39] <Affles001> is there anything against not pvping and people all just looting?

[2022-12-20 16:10:20] <%WildJokerr> @donywahlberg it‚Äôs insane by me for instance in 4 years at my house it doubled in price. Wish I could sell and buy a larger house but that won‚Äôt happen lol
[2022-12-20 16:10:23] <NotEasyBeinGreen> had the stream on behind a screen and forgot. so when i put my headphones on, all i heard was, "tink tink tink tink" of the bottles lol
