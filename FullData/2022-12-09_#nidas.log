[2022-12-09 17:22:38] <wzem26> Apparently Genshin Impact offered in-game rewards if people voted for the player's choice award
[2022-12-09 17:22:38] <%Ererior> devil may cry!

[2022-12-09 17:22:55] <@%gostonko> wzem26 nidas cant possibly comment on that PepeLaugh
[2022-12-09 17:23:01] <jotello10> It's like rating food by looking at pictures of it
[2022-12-09 17:23:02] <%workwerk> based
[2022-12-09 17:23:24] <%+CuppaT_XYZ> its the nuances of a game though they often make it really good
[2022-12-09 17:23:24] <@%gostonko> idc i'm still gonna apply that to food
[2022-12-09 17:23:25] <@%senlash> I've found the tape PEPW
[2022-12-09 17:23:26] <%GoutOfWar> that ninja turtle game seems good

[2022-12-09 17:23:32] <%+Purplebeansprout> don't need to murder someone to know you probably shouldn't murder people
[2022-12-09 17:23:43] <%pukuotukas666> Turtles should have won all
[2022-12-09 17:23:45] <@%gostonko> senlash PauseChamp was i right
[2022-12-09 17:23:47] <ghengis_is_love> the COD snubs could be real. it's an actual bug ridden game. id love to see the vote counts for each category

[2022-12-09 17:24:21] <jotello10> A Plague Tale didn't win anything Sadge
[2022-12-09 17:24:28] <%punishedkai> best action adventure should of went to Plague tale
[2022-12-09 17:24:42] <%+Purplebeansprout> someone made the argument that gow is just a sony game with extreme polish, perfecting the formula, but still the fformula
[2022-12-09 17:24:42] <%Ererior> Cat hater
[2022-12-09 17:24:45] <%IKEA_DOG> bayonettas kinda hot so I don't mind it that much
[2022-12-09 17:24:45] <MohgLoB> Plague Tale should've won best narrative DESPAIR
[2022-12-09 17:24:58] <%Kikobri_> Plague Tale narrative had some issues
[2022-12-09 17:25:04] <Koltens> ^
[2022-12-09 17:25:14] <%eiho_> the GOW game direction is very similar to the first one, so out of the 2 elden ring deserved it
[2022-12-09 17:25:26] <%Ererior> true
[2022-12-09 17:25:35] <MohgLoB> Why is Horizon there KEKW
[2022-12-09 17:25:37] <%punishedkai> Plague tale action/adventure was where it should of won DESPAIR
[2022-12-09 17:25:38] <%FraudOnTheTele> George Fans PEPW
[2022-12-09 17:25:45] <%argonzzzzz> definitely not a story with that one
[2022-12-09 17:26:04] <%workwerk> 99% of the Elden ring narrative I learnt from Wikipedia
[2022-12-09 17:26:11] <%+CuppaT_XYZ> i dunno
[2022-12-09 17:26:18] <%+CuppaT_XYZ> scorn probably deserved that imo
[2022-12-09 17:26:22] <%punishedkai> I felt scorn should of won art direction
[2022-12-09 17:26:28] <3ven> Elden ring is so much more "big"
[2022-12-09 17:26:32] <%eiho_> SC OMEGALUL RN
[2022-12-09 17:26:42] <%+CuppaT_XYZ> art direction should've been scorn 100%
[2022-12-09 17:26:45] <%Ererior> bet it was close
[2022-12-09 17:26:48] <3ven> Metal hellsinger is the type of game i wish had won
[2022-12-09 17:26:52] <@%senlash> @gostonko he voted tmnt
[2022-12-09 17:26:55] <%Spock_x> Scorn for me even though it’s not the kind of game I would play has a more interesting art direction.

[2022-12-09 17:47:13] <%GetZonked> I feel like games journalism is all bought and paid for in some way by marketing budgets. It seems like it's just all sponsored content.
