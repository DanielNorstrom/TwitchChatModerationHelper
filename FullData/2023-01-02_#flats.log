[2023-01-02 20:39:59] <%+lifelesslinh> maybe giving him a movement ability?
[2023-01-02 20:40:00] <%lukawbu> smoke nade
[2023-01-02 20:40:01] <@%chompchomp8> Hes not even good against flankers @Flats mostly other hitscans like ashe or soldier. Pretty much every flanker has a way to get rid of the predator missile
[2023-01-02 20:40:03] <blackniekro> give him two rolls
[2023-01-02 20:40:04] <%The_Beast_1125_> Something not already done better by Ash
[2023-01-02 20:40:12] <AestheticVampire> flash bang was better
[2023-01-02 20:40:13] <%$jasonwocky> he used to have loud footsteps. put them back and he'll be fine
[2023-01-02 20:40:15] <+Remixed_Nova> Is would be really cool if he had a flashbang to stun enemies that would be crazy i think
[2023-01-02 20:40:16] <busser22> they should change it to a flashbang KEKW
[2023-01-02 20:40:19] <sammoss05> are u ginna play wit somnus or emongg td
[2023-01-02 20:40:20] <hawks_sa> just give him the old stun nade
[2023-01-02 20:40:23] <b_stratos> Bring back right-click headshots
[2023-01-02 20:40:25] <xperiment_x> just give him back the stun tbh
[2023-01-02 20:40:26] <%+rakingitt> also it feels like the only good part of his kit is the predator missle which makes him weird to pay
[2023-01-02 20:40:27] <%Litdaze> That Orisa skin took the starts from the All Star Dva kke.

[2023-01-02 20:40:27] <+cynicaltilt> Its good against 2/3rds of the heros - but its not good lol

[2023-01-02 20:59:45] <skeeterbeater0> comma is best for crouch
[2023-01-02 20:59:46] <shayzeebear> I'd recommend also strafing around a target or bot and changing your around sensitivity until you can stay on the same spot or close to since mouse is a lot different to joysticks
[2023-01-02 20:59:49] <+butt_slaps> voice coms and melee are what i use on the mouse buttons

[2023-01-02 21:00:01] <%+TheAnimeSurgeon> left alt or c is the best for crouch

[2023-01-02 21:00:14] <%sunscreen_queen> The only character I use side button for crouch is Mercy, to make super jumping easier
[2023-01-02 21:00:15] <%Suspect333> i usually have reload on the mouse wheel though.

[2023-01-02 21:18:03] <+InuRobot> Since they moved it down the pass, any semi consistent player should have it unlocked.

[2023-01-02 21:18:21] <hyperfrrr> @aaymon86 it‚Äôs hard to level up and if the character is Meta buying the battle pass to sorta master the character helps when they are introduced into comp

[2023-01-02 21:33:50] <%Name_Amauri> The entire game will be balanced if mercy gets 3 more bullets. Not any more though, she'll be too powerful
[2023-01-02 21:33:53] <%+Spluge_Mcduck> orisa sucks to play against in low ranks because she is the easiest target to shoot.  in low ranks people have no confidence in their aim, so they shoot the easiest target

[2023-01-02 21:53:33] <@%^StreamElements> When Flats was in high school he joined the football team. Within his first week there, someone else on the team ended up crossing a line and pissing Flats off. Flats flattened the kid with his 6ft body, thus earning him the nickname "Flats" since "Flatten" sounds stupid.

[2023-01-02 22:52:57] <schwifster> because hog the way he is currently is what makes him hog, changing him to any major extent would change his whole playstyle, a style thats been around since ow1 launch
[2023-01-02 22:52:59] <Batsat94> doom rework to support
[2023-01-02 22:53:01] <Batsat94> is the best

[2023-01-02 22:53:26] <KeatonWasTaken> Sombra just need her kit reworked from a "poke and disappear back into basically spawn with infinite invis" to a more active strong poker imo

[2023-01-02 23:03:35] <%+aaymon86> Echo is def the hardest hero to play. See could range from S to D tier.
[2023-01-02 23:03:35] <Jouush> I like to imagine devs incorporate 'community feedback' into their hero balancing choices by using an algorithm that sees how often people say "Nerf/Buff HERO NAME HERE" and that as a result, it takes the meme "Nerf Genji" seriously. They already use generalized in-game stats, I wouldn't put something like that past them lol

[2023-01-02 23:05:14] <%+Dauntos> Genji has more survivability, at least.
[2023-01-02 23:05:14] <ChronoAura> Nano Blade still strong
[2023-01-02 23:05:16] <weeesd3> hanzo is worse
[2023-01-02 23:05:20] <+Rey_Rey_Aria> Genji and cass can be equality useless
[2023-01-02 23:05:21] <alex12_pankis> Nerf genji
[2023-01-02 23:05:21] <+zalg0text> genji isn't worse than cass
[2023-01-02 23:05:21] <mhg_poisonous> bottom c tbh

[2023-01-02 23:05:23] <+ChidoriiChan> Good player on Genji or Cass, Genji likely carrying more fights
[2023-01-02 23:05:25] <phatpolarbear> Mei is B

[2023-01-02 23:05:31] <%Ari0n0s> HYPERNOPERS
[2023-01-02 23:05:31] <malmal46> I think mei is a solid B.
[2023-01-02 23:05:32] <lzimmlive> Nope
[2023-01-02 23:05:34] <bladeelover11> these all also depend on how you play them and how well you can optimize their abilities

[2023-01-02 23:08:00] <+jonsnow1605> B tier, hard to play but can dominate with one-shots

[2023-01-02 23:08:25] <+TheSnaccKing> most Hanzo's just get lucky with their shots ngl, I'd put him in C or D
[2023-01-02 23:08:30] <KeatonWasTaken> His damage adds up fast, way more consistently than Genji or Cass, definitely at least B tier here

[2023-01-02 23:14:24] <+BigSkitty> Hard disagree from me
[2023-01-02 23:14:25] <legacy59> Pharah b
[2023-01-02 23:14:26] <danonenord> 3 Anas shoots
[2023-01-02 23:14:27] <legacy59> B
[2023-01-02 23:14:30] <%Ari0n0s> Phara rockets always strong
[2023-01-02 23:14:33] <lzimmlive> B
[2023-01-02 23:14:33] <ChronoAura> I can still 2-tap Pharah as Cassidy.
[2023-01-02 23:14:33] <%+aaymon86> It's not that easy to shoot her out of the air
[2023-01-02 23:14:33] <%Kinda_wackthefirst> B
[2023-01-02 23:14:33] <Â∞ñÂ∞æ (timothy900613)> maybe B
[2023-01-02 23:14:34] <cry0uts> ashe makes short work of her tho
[2023-01-02 23:14:34] <@%chompchomp8> ok well "if you dont have a pocketed really good sojourn on the enemy team" applies to literally every hero @Flats
[2023-01-02 23:14:35] <@%chompchomp8> KEKW
[2023-01-02 23:14:36] <JGExtreme700> echo much better
[2023-01-02 23:14:37] <%t00mbs> B
[2023-01-02 23:14:37] <profsorfluf> B because sojourn is going to slap
[2023-01-02 23:14:38] <composedmage> room temp takes
[2023-01-02 23:14:38] <%jackstoningt0n> Pharah decent on PC but crazy good on console
[2023-01-02 23:14:39] <lovelyaimzyt> B
[2023-01-02 23:14:39] <%+bebex001_> i think pharah is good because Junk bastion is played a lot

[2023-01-02 23:14:50] <+Elsfic> HUH
[2023-01-02 23:14:51] <AlarmRefined> C
[2023-01-02 23:14:51] <MrPotato_6> b
[2023-01-02 23:14:51] <willoexo> I'd say Pharah is A, not being bias cause I main her lol
[2023-01-02 23:14:52] <XaneTheCaveman> b
[2023-01-02 23:14:52] <ballsfan43792> b
[2023-01-02 23:14:52] <Two_For_Twenty> I was going to say B. I've mained her since ow1 and She just ain't as good you have 5 counters That are VERY common picks. I would even argue she is C
[2023-01-02 23:14:54] <composedmage> lukewarm takes
[2023-01-02 23:14:54] <$ZeoBishop> she is an a with mercy
[2023-01-02 23:14:54] <illusionsatlas> Don‚Äôt see her all that often
[2023-01-02 23:14:54] <j3rryyyyyy_> pharah sucks ngl
[2023-01-02 23:14:55] <%+TheDeadlyCloud> b
[2023-01-02 23:14:56] <Slava011_> I never understood how to utilize her properly FallHalp
[2023-01-02 23:14:56] <+Rey_Rey_Aria> A to B because of counter
[2023-01-02 23:14:57] <%SpaceCircus_> if pharah cant get a pocket heal just delete her
[2023-01-02 23:14:58] <gyro_zeppeli_p7> pharah shits on junk so she gets c tier obviously
[2023-01-02 23:14:58] <%+Chunko_Muffo> D tier imo
[2023-01-02 23:14:58] <+obijuankenobi_66> Pharah shit to play against in low ranks
[2023-01-02 23:14:58] <+tom_with_a_t> Ashe, cas, soljourn, widow can counter her so players always switch from pharah to someone else
[2023-01-02 23:14:59] <%+Bcnez> OMEGALUL
[2023-01-02 23:15:00] <%+TheDeadlyCloud> B tier
[2023-01-02 23:15:03] <+Elsfic> true lol
[2023-01-02 23:15:03] <NyxTheNeko> shes really good in gold cause my DPS never seem to shoot at her xD
[2023-01-02 23:15:04] <evnoga09> I would say B
[2023-01-02 23:15:04] <%$ItsNoizyBear> A with mercy. B alone
[2023-01-02 23:15:08] <KeatonWasTaken> Solo Pharah is like a mosquito, annoying but low harm, with a Mercy it's like an attack chopper
[2023-01-02 23:15:08] <toswtkm> Low A she does a shit ton of damage  but once you have hitscan its hard for her to do most things
[2023-01-02 23:15:09] <profsorfluf> junks kill pharahs consistently
[2023-01-02 23:15:11] <+crowdozer> phara is only weak to echo unless phara player is bad
[2023-01-02 23:15:14] <sekki002> shes dominating in gold and silver right now
[2023-01-02 23:15:14] <ziggygm> A
[2023-01-02 23:15:14] <%Ari0n0s> KEKW actual skill issue
[2023-01-02 23:15:15] <@%chompchomp8> I think shes B just because how good hitscan is
[2023-01-02 23:15:16] <%sofishdekat> NODDERS
[2023-01-02 23:15:18] <%+trustytres> current meta, i say B.
[2023-01-02 23:15:18] <%+oscargal53> Junkrats just dont fear pharas anymore
[2023-01-02 23:15:19] <+solxreklipse> D
[2023-01-02 23:15:19] <mrjoesterrrr> Junkrats in high ranks are like physics professors or something
[2023-01-02 23:15:19] <rtx3080ti_abuser> All the pharah is see in gold elo have gold weapons KEKW
[2023-01-02 23:15:20] <ChronoAura> nah. Sniping as Junkrat in OW1 was very easy.
[2023-01-02 23:15:21] <%ItzTheUnknown_G> I think she‚Äôs B, but if she gets pocketed A
[2023-01-02 23:15:21] <yoballs235> B
[2023-01-02 23:15:21] <%SpaceCircus_> is it because of the hitbox thing?
[2023-01-02 23:15:23] <%+Quizzystyle> pharah is a with mercy pocket but b without
[2023-01-02 23:15:24] <ziggygm> Did not change my mind
[2023-01-02 23:15:24] <hikarikariz> B probably
[2023-01-02 23:15:28] <+Mikazukix1> Probably B. She's too easy to counter.
[2023-01-02 23:15:28] <%+Zombi3pinup> C

[2023-01-02 23:16:50] <%+Spluge_Mcduck> the problem with low tier pharah is the skill required to kill pharah is way higher than the skill required to get value on the pharah

[2023-01-02 23:21:24] <%+Placidflunky> I just want her tp to have a duration because you just tp out the moment someone gets close to killing you, and you harass the backline for free

[2023-01-02 23:21:30] <aqua_the_goddess> she is unplayable easily outclassed by other flankers

[2023-01-02 23:21:45] <TheseJeans> if you get rid of Sombras hack you get rid of her entire gimmick lol, it might as well not be Sombra and a different characater
[2023-01-02 23:21:47] <aqua_the_goddess> not to mention kiriko
[2023-01-02 23:21:47] <%EmpoweredWhiskey> make sombra a support
[2023-01-02 23:21:47] <Two_For_Twenty> I think her hack should only shut down abilities for half a second and her ult should shutdown for 5 seconds and the duration should not change

[2023-01-02 23:30:31] <%+SoullessRedhead> Moria is either dominant or snoozer
[2023-01-02 23:30:31] <%clever_corvid> Moira is the anti-Sojourn.  She's amazing at low ranks and less effective the higher you go
[2023-01-02 23:30:32] <sleepibunz> Bc they have the mechanical of a doorknob
[2023-01-02 23:30:32] <toswtkm> Moira is C and i main her

[2023-01-02 23:30:40] <%ItzTheUnknown_G> Low rank only dps moira tho because no one knows how to play against her
[2023-01-02 23:30:41] <sleepibunz> I cant think
[2023-01-02 23:30:42] <KeatonWasTaken> Moira ruins certain heroes tbh, I even like her against Ashe a little if you catch her off
[2023-01-02 23:30:44] <Ventrall> C
[2023-01-02 23:30:46] <SonicBoom113> But I think she‚Äôs decent in terms of pure healing and such

[2023-01-02 23:30:49] <%SpaceCircus_> some people on enemy dps just do not know how to kill a moira or speak up if they get bullied and get dps gapped
[2023-01-02 23:30:51] <+pineecone> as someone who was in diamond for a while, moira still dominated in there
[2023-01-02 23:30:51] <%+SoullessRedhead> I dislike playing her, but she can climb fast if the player is half-way competent
[2023-01-02 23:30:53] <+Rey_Rey_Aria> I think the moira orb used to be slower
[2023-01-02 23:30:57] <sleepibunz> Ok agreed
[2023-01-02 23:30:59] <Two_For_Twenty> Also emongg is talking about moiras that don't throw there orbs out correctly if you have a good moira that knows how to ricochet she has insane heal potential

[2023-01-02 23:32:42] <yoru_567> It's just a skill issue
[2023-01-02 23:32:43] <%The_Mansarde> Ana's lack of movement still can be a problem though.
[2023-01-02 23:32:43] <%SynnfullySweet> thats actually a good point

[2023-01-02 23:33:47] <toswtkm> @Flats Are you gonna post Tik Toks of this tier list to see how bad peoples takes are?
[2023-01-02 23:33:48] <%themariocuevas> @sleepibunz Yes, but then you heal slower, cause you cannot shoot at the same rate
[2023-01-02 23:33:52] <%uncleduges45> if not every support is able to use ana or aim that good no matter the rank how is she s tier?
[2023-01-02 23:33:54] <pk_silver_> is this list for ranked or pro play?
[2023-01-02 23:33:54] <ilovehotmoms58> How do I decide what good guns to buy it‚Äôs very stresdful
[2023-01-02 23:33:54] <xtreme1984> do they ever play moira seriously?
[2023-01-02 23:33:56] <ChronoAura> And better survivability with Kiko.

[2023-01-02 23:38:50] <pure_ivl45> where Karq at >
[2023-01-02 23:38:51] <%ponez> thedogbeard true, my rein is also F-tier ohnFeels

[2023-01-02 23:38:52] <+kam4300> Her ults the only thing lacking and that‚Äôs because of Lucios ult
[2023-01-02 23:38:52] <ChronoAura> Lucio will become meta because of the major Queen buffs.

[2023-01-02 23:39:06] <AlarmRefined> Lucio always seems a better pick
[2023-01-02 23:39:07] <legacy59> She‚Äôs not good

[2023-01-02 23:39:23] <@%chompchomp8> it was the twitter Q&A
[2023-01-02 23:39:27] <%NightSpinner_> Brig is B

[2023-01-02 23:39:42] <didafoo180> what is this tier list?

[2023-01-02 23:39:43] <+ActuallyNarwhal> Brig is Low B. If not Low be, high C.
[2023-01-02 23:39:43] <sir_kil_alott> nah other supports are way better there's never a day where anybody thinks you should switch to brig
[2023-01-02 23:39:46] <%jugatrix> Nice brain ya got there . thats a really good point
[2023-01-02 23:39:48] <+zalg0text> @guccilini he's saying she'd be even higher if the meta characters were nerfed

[2023-01-02 23:39:54] <%IronAddictKidd> @Evilbeard yes that is literally her character. even in the lore. she just protects whats around her and nothing else.
[2023-01-02 23:39:55] <%+bebex001_> Brig is the least fun support to play
[2023-01-02 23:39:56] <cringeindeed> Brig stun for a small fraction back on her shield bash could help her
[2023-01-02 23:39:56] <soniccj_456> F is the lowest rank ?
[2023-01-02 23:39:56] <RandomNinja98> i dont think shes B just because of that specific scenario
[2023-01-02 23:39:58] <%+cabinholetal> Have to respectfully disagree, you are making huge copium and you said yourself that the meta is not in favor of Brig, that‚Äôs the reason she‚Äôs not good. And the fact that she has potential still doesn‚Äôt mean she‚Äôs good.

[2023-01-02 23:40:09] <%its_mrriceguy> I get what you're saying, but I think ranking Brig based on what could happen is weird. While her utility isn't terrible, her ult is garbo and the worst in the game
[2023-01-02 23:40:11] <Graysog> her ult is just so much worse without armor
[2023-01-02 23:40:11] <Vanityssj4> brig is D

[2023-01-02 23:40:13] <+pineecone> if thats ur explanation for brig, why not zar b tier then? shes just off meta rn
[2023-01-02 23:40:14] <ChronoAura> Lucio/Kiko will be meta, after JQ buffs during Mid-season patch.

[2023-01-02 23:41:14] <+BigSkitty> Brig is worst character in the game she has no ult
[2023-01-02 23:41:16] <%its_mrriceguy> @Im_Gilly I think stats like this are a bit biased and gonna be skewed because only the best Brig players are gonna play her

[2023-01-02 23:41:17] <%$Dankey0> STOP THE BRIG HATE CHAT SHES STILL MOMMY
[2023-01-02 23:41:19] <%IronAddictKidd> @Im_Gilly yes brig has a higher win % because the people who pick her tend to know how to play her. Where as people pick ana cause she is ana.
[2023-01-02 23:41:20] <%Severd8> Brig should not be with Moira. @flats
[2023-01-02 23:41:20] <%SpaceCircus_> brig is on the same level as moira

[2023-01-02 23:41:29] <johnwill_> aint no way she stays at B
[2023-01-02 23:41:29] <%clever_corvid> What? I pick Brig specifically to kill Moiras, who's losing that duel?

[2023-01-02 23:41:33] <+mrconflict> brig is super niche. she is good at what she is good at but pretty bad at everything else
[2023-01-02 23:41:33] <%SpaceCircus_> bc some moiras can be shit but some brigs are amazing
[2023-01-02 23:41:33] <noireius> whats the tier list ranking
[2023-01-02 23:41:34] <youngplayyer> Moira and brig can‚Äôt be on same tier
[2023-01-02 23:41:35] <%jugatrix> comission to have 2 moiras 1 for regular moira and another for the tiktok moira playstyle
[2023-01-02 23:41:36] <Roachelle_> im honestly a big fan of brig, shes fun to play for me
[2023-01-02 23:41:37] <+xvanillachaix> Brig is good on certain maps and if not punished can get away with a lot
[2023-01-02 23:41:38] <+BigSkitty> @BigSkitty mald
[2023-01-02 23:41:39] <%NightSpinner_> Brig is B tier flatsH flatsH flatsH
[2023-01-02 23:41:40] <+Victinho_2901> Brig can't shine with Junkrat on S tier

[2023-01-02 23:41:41] <+fersurski> unfollowing all ow2 streamers they play a dead game
[2023-01-02 23:41:42] <+ActuallyNarwhal> @kam4300 Yup! And if the enemy team is actually running a Dive comp you can counter it by playing her. If the other team is running meta, I agree that she isn't the best pick, but she isn't a throw pick by no means
[2023-01-02 23:41:44] <SSynicall> moira should be higher
[2023-01-02 23:41:45] <+dajuicebar> brig is a because shes map dependent like widow

[2023-01-02 23:41:50] <mitokondriya> It kinda just depends what the enemy team is running, if Brig is viable or not

[2023-01-02 23:45:15] <tommy__ani999> MERCY THE DPS BOOST AND HER SURVIVE ABILITY IS JUST OP
[2023-01-02 23:45:15] <+Fou_Emperor> Her Super jump should be on cooldown
[2023-01-02 23:45:15] <pandawarrior0309> I think that for the new hero for season 3 it should be a melee dps because tank and support have melee based character like Reinhardt doomfist and Brigete
[2023-01-02 23:45:15] <swaginthebags> ok but she is not broken 99% of the time

[2023-01-02 23:46:06] <edwes2007> Why is doomfist so high up, he was the worst character and then they mega nerfed his punch and buffed the rest of his kit a tiny bit. He was better in season one with his increased stun and shorter cooldown.
[2023-01-02 23:46:07] <sir_kil_alott> yeah and what dies brig do compared to this ‚ò†Ô∏è

[2023-01-02 23:46:07] <+kam4300> @actuallynarwhal yes!! I think losing a tank actually helped her because now I can focus more on dps while also getting hits in to heal that tank. META CAN EAT MY ASS CUZ BRIG IS GOAT

[2023-01-02 23:54:00] <DrakDragon_05> I feel like hog is 100% S tier because lower rated players don't always know how to counter him with Orise
[2023-01-02 23:54:02] <youngplayyer> No
[2023-01-02 23:54:03] VIEWERS: 8¬†622
[2023-01-02 23:54:10] <%+Chunko_Muffo> they should just make it a cool down ability with like a 30 second cool down and a set length of time to try and burst
[2023-01-02 23:54:13] <+GoIdenRule> @Flats How are Cass, Genji and Hanzo on the same tier??
[2023-01-02 23:54:19] <+ghostslovetacos> i can solo hog all day with junkrat. upclose he cant be beaten
[2023-01-02 23:54:26] <KeatonWasTaken> @GoIdenRule cause they're all mid
[2023-01-02 23:54:29] <DrFreeman23> as a zen main getting people to target the tank is the hardest... everyone is targeting someone else and other supports out heal it
[2023-01-02 23:54:30] <Tam_Questfinder> !video
[2023-01-02 23:54:32] <%4DLuvOfLuthy> hog is def s tier, only like one consistent counter
[2023-01-02 23:54:33] <Zippyheru> Mei is very lack luster these days :(
[2023-01-02 23:54:36] <$ZeoBishop> it is almost like there is not a def answer for this YEP

[2023-01-02 23:54:41] <+5Picoseconds> Having 1 bad matchup doesn't necessarily drop you a rank
[2023-01-02 23:54:41] <+parker31108> !drops
[2023-01-02 23:54:48] <%SleepyBear_18> what kind of teir list we doing? @Flats just got home from work
[2023-01-02 23:54:51] <+Zylach> Isn't that still the same logic as to why Winston belongs in B though? If the enemy team doesn't auto-swap to Hog then what tier is he? Same goes for Hog v Orisa does it?
[2023-01-02 23:54:56] <%$xepicryan> People keep saying amp is to one person, but its 1 person who does damage to all 5 as opposed to discord where all 5 do more damage to 1. Theyre both bad for the game imo
[2023-01-02 23:54:59] <+ActuallyNarwhal> @kam4300 Honestly felt, I really hope rein comps also return, but with ramattra in the cycle I don't think rein comps stand a chance anymore
[2023-01-02 23:55:04] <dJericho_> im so here for it
[2023-01-02 23:55:04] <blackb3rri3s> I would put zen A tier
[2023-01-02 23:55:07] <+SimoneMrg> Orisa is much easier to counter with many tanks than Hog with any hero that's not Orisa
[2023-01-02 23:55:09] <youngplayyer> Orisa is A and brig low C
[2023-01-02 23:55:10] <jtishbk> Hi flats

[2023-01-02 23:56:34] <%+momohimex> @acidodsc Because the meta is so far back Sojourn/Mercy and Widowmaker/Ashe she can't get much play even though she can somewhat counter hog
[2023-01-02 23:56:34] <blackb3rri3s> pls put zen a
[2023-01-02 23:56:34] <%+jodrajoko> I thought Zen Ramattra would be meta when Roadhog gets nerfed

[2023-01-02 23:57:53] <luukulu> ehy is brig not in S tier??
[2023-01-02 23:57:53] <steankyboy1228> maybe add a cooldown to discord and make it last like 5 secs but if u kill enemy it resets and buff his healing a bit. maybe 2 healing orbs.
[2023-01-02 23:57:53] <%themariocuevas> WE NEED IT
[2023-01-02 23:57:54] <%SpaceCircus_> @Ventrall lil bro playing a different game i guess
[2023-01-02 23:57:56] <+Rey_Rey_Aria> He still has mobility issues but seems strong still
[2023-01-02 23:57:56] <+TFA_Deadpool> cap
[2023-01-02 23:57:57] <khaos_wolf73> so then at max go zen has full hp debuff but when he gets low the debuff goes down or something like that #
[2023-01-02 23:57:58] <NaveThaShade> supports need HP buffs
[2023-01-02 23:57:58] <grimnir_xx> thank you!!!
[2023-01-02 23:58:00] <%+jodrajoko> Agreed
[2023-01-02 23:58:01] <Jellypeanut> supports on your tier list are all B+ with three in S

[2023-01-02 23:58:08] <ajeenyis> supports dont die if 1: they are good. 2: if your dps suck
[2023-01-02 23:58:09] <spruceaddict> I think ana is still A tier
[2023-01-02 23:58:09] <dJericho_> speed boof
[2023-01-02 23:58:09] <croakinglizard11> How bruh
[2023-01-02 23:58:10] <%Ari0n0s> I think supp doesnt need b uffs but need reworks , with better kits
[2023-01-02 23:58:12] <+Zylach> Support buffs are dangerous. Do we want the game to be defined by supports being ridiculous like moth meta or release Brig?

[2023-01-02 23:58:19] <%SaintVizard> supports need more variety if that makes sense
[2023-01-02 23:58:19] <sir_kil_alott> supports need buffs to make them fun to heal like ana
[2023-01-02 23:58:20] <+jellphishking> you need to move down brig if zen in B tier
[2023-01-02 23:58:25] <%ThatOtakuInTheCorner> @therealjusthit Speed buff + extra armour
[2023-01-02 23:58:27] <KeaganAnimeGod> The biggest buff to Zen is that all the dive characters aren't able to be played as much into Hog/Orisa, so he has so much space to get value without winston/d.va type dives to worry about.
[2023-01-02 23:58:27] <ChronoAura> Then healing would be too high.
[2023-01-02 23:58:28] <theworsttimelime> yea people melt too fast nowadays where you have to constantly heal
[2023-01-02 23:58:28] <%Ari0n0s> @SaintVizard NODDERS
[2023-01-02 23:58:32] <spruceaddict> @sir_kil_alott ana is fine right now what
[2023-01-02 23:58:35] <spankyhunter> if they lowered all the damage then no need to buff everyone else
[2023-01-02 23:58:39] <Tarnschnitzel> what was his argument for B tier brig LUL
[2023-01-02 23:58:43] <+therealjusthit> @thatotakuinthecorner even after the buff i could've sworn everyone was saying ramattra sucks or is mid
[2023-01-02 23:58:48] <+zenpunk> Flats just not making sense ... supports not weak, everyone else just strong... uh, yeah...
[2023-01-02 23:58:49] <%+jodrajoko> Support sucks cause you are doing everything in your power to live
[2023-01-02 23:58:51] <+ijamistic2> No need to recreate support metas like release brig or moth
[2023-01-02 23:58:51] <sir_kil_alott> @spruceaddict I said they need to make healing fun like ana bruh
[2023-01-02 23:58:55] <scopedog7> bad take, yeah damage is too high but healing is also too high with 2 support + 2 support passive for 5 people
[2023-01-02 23:58:56] <%Ari0n0s> HYPERNODDERS  yes yes
[2023-01-02 23:58:56] <pk_silver_> ??????
[2023-01-02 23:58:56] <NaveThaShade> comps are the average comp match people hard stick characters
[2023-01-02 23:58:59] <Intereo> ana
[2023-01-02 23:59:01] <kab193> Support stigma, they don‚Äôt need much help, just a little buff to brig and they all ok to play
[2023-01-02 23:59:03] <lucindiee> @lucindiee in my opinion if you are good at hanzo you can beat any of the b and low a tier dps
[2023-01-02 23:59:05] <+SmokerSasha> @therealjusthit ppl learned to use him, he can absolutely dominate if played correctly
[2023-01-02 23:59:05] <pk_silver_> more?

[2023-01-02 23:59:21] <%+ALEXEATSOREOS> I'd like them to nerf sleep to give ana more mobility
[2023-01-02 23:59:23] <%+cabinholetal> Damage is what makes the game more fun tho, just buff healing then
