[2022-12-29 00:00:06] <%babyaddalyn> acording to wiki Tunnels are 1 input to N outputs. This means you can output to as many points as you want, but only input at a single point per tunnel.

[2022-12-29 16:13:42] <%OrangeW2> they also replace it for free almost infinitely

[2022-12-29 16:15:06] <officialhunterx> why not hang the cable from the celling so you dont step on it
[2022-12-29 16:15:17] <@%+PiratePati> Valve replaced my entire base station when it broke for free

[2022-12-29 16:16:00] <%OrangeW2> AFAIK the best thing you can do is to unplug it from the breakaway and untangle it every time you finish playing

[2022-12-29 16:16:06] <$venom366> just buy liquid metal Kappa
[2022-12-29 16:16:15] <+bugsplatter23> it sounds like the best thing to do is tie the cable to the headset so stress doesn't go to the connector

[2022-12-29 16:16:38] <zonizyde> i tend to punch my headset l0l
[2022-12-29 16:16:38] <%OrangeW2> @bugsplatter23 unfortunately it's usually never the connector failing, it's the actual wire within the cable at any point
[2022-12-29 16:16:39] <%$mobfarmer> never use a cable, and it won't break

[2022-12-29 16:25:28] <%Dagmoo> @zynithtv the adblocks can cause the ads. the only real way to fix it is disable the adblocker on twitch.

[2022-12-29 16:37:20] <%+P00nDozer69> They don't have live tracking of staffing, it's all based on expected location and has to be updated manually
[2022-12-29 16:37:21] <%+Deystan> why spend money on software when you can keep the money Pog
[2022-12-29 16:37:22] <%Allmostdone> Supposedly that the software couldn’t match up crew with planes
[2022-12-29 16:37:25] <Archie8300> why invest in improving when you can scrape by

[2022-12-29 16:37:30] <%DaemonSzyman> That must have cost them millions
[2022-12-29 16:37:30] <+Droly> southwest doesn't have a hub like delta etc. So they have a plane go to 4 places if that flight gets canceled it is a domino effect
[2022-12-29 16:37:31] <+elric689> they did stock buy backs instead of updating software
[2022-12-29 16:37:32] <%+Thalmize> it was only a matter of time
[2022-12-29 16:37:33] <Artzmann> @giantwaffle this is what happens when you spend all your money on stock buybacks instead of investing in the company
[2022-12-29 16:37:33] <+xindianx> They said they were attempting to track ALL of their crew and pilots via paper while trying to sort it out.

[2022-12-29 16:46:23] <%$mobfarmer> if it takes 600 seconds,  create 10 systemes. that it takes 60 seconds per process.
[2022-12-29 16:46:25] <kane1941> i think its intended to have like 20 specialized EBFs
[2022-12-29 16:46:32] <+Manacaym> make a massive ebf room, you got the power now

[2022-12-29 16:47:22] <%Venxuri> @Giantwaffle I'd recommend emitting base on the amount of boules that you have, since 1 Wafer cuts into so many boules
[2022-12-29 16:47:28] <Niceyyy> wafer or booles ?
[2022-12-29 16:47:32] <%$Venamah> your gonna need more EBF's for late game, id just bite the bullet and make more
[2022-12-29 16:48:12] <%Turnpoint> just a 1000 in your system at all
[2022-12-29 16:48:13] <dylan0806> You should use the booles not the wafers

[2022-12-29 16:49:33] <%Venxuri> there is a cover for gt machines that makes them accept redstone signal than you can level emit straight to the ebf and it turns off
[2022-12-29 16:50:04] <%Venxuri> your way is also good, tru

[2022-12-29 20:31:34] <RingSong> to be fair .. they do literally have to make money. Because they are big. Now if only ... other, smaller, game dev companies were more stable as a work environment, that'd be great..
