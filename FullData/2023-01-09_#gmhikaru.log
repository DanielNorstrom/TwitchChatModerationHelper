[2023-01-09 17:14:16] <rs10rs10> Urban Dictionary: üí¢ Disrespect is when you show a lack of regard or consideration for someone or something. üò§ It can be as simple as not saying "please" or "thank you," or as serious as openly mocking or belittling someone. üò† Disrespect is a big no-no and can really hurt someone's feelings. üö´ So let's all try to be a little more respectful, yeah? ü§ù

[2023-01-09 17:33:37] <spirigatito> Legend has it that chess was invented around 200 B. C. by a commander, H√°n Xin, who invented the game as a battle simulator. Soon after winning the battle, the game was forgotten, but it resurfaced in the 7th century. For the Chinese, Chess was invented by the mythical Emperor Shennong or by his successor, Huangdi
