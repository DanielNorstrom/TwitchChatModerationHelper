[2022-12-26 00:54:47] <%Tadas13571> you know how english has 2 ways to pronaunce every letter. for exemple the letter a you can have it said as ei or  a in lithuanina it's only the second one and all words ar read as they are writen un like english were one letter can make 5 diffrent letter sound like C can be C K S but in lithanina C is only C

[2022-12-26 01:04:06] <atcolt> true with the sticking to the language thing... I learned French in school and during university, I lived in Belgium (where they speak French), but I was so close to the GErman border that everyone was speaking GErman there still... Only if the phone company or someone gave me a call, there was a little bit of French involved, and by the time they did speak to fast for me to understand them anymore ^^;
