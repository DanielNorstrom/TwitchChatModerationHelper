[2022-12-28 14:30:11] <%$Memil03> for example make sure to save up money when you think your ruler is about to die so your heir got lots of money to bribe and such
[2022-12-28 14:30:16] <%KaitoOnTheClock> I woke up late so the cats are pissy about me not having done chores. So I will be right back yokaiHey

[2022-12-28 14:31:15] <verajonson> also a good idea is to make sure your heir is 16 or else EVERYONE is going to auto dislike them and they just take BIG penalties because they are a child
[2022-12-28 14:31:45] <%$Memil03> Mm thats why you want lots of money so you can bribe a ton of people
