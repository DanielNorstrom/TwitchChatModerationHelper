Me and my attack buffs used to give you a hard time on ladder. Sorry you were just an easy matchup lol. I can see you do not possess true power. Remember top 100 legend, the rank you wanted to reach? Yeah it's only demon hunters now. I deal over 10 damage face every turn from hand and lifesteal to full. I guess you are not prepared, huh? Nice catching up lol. Vengeance

Me and my attack buffs used to give you a hard time on ladder. Sorry you were just an easy matchup lol. I can see you do not possess true power. Remember top 100 legend, the rank you wanted to reach? Yeah it's only demon hunters now. I deal over 10 damage face every turn from hand and lifesteal to full. I guess you are not prepared, huh? Nice catching up lol. Vengeance

[2023-01-05 15:07:14] <@%Uhmge> Leeroy Jenkins created a strategy that revolved around trying to defeat your opponent in one turn without requiring any cards on the board. Fighting for board control and battles between minions make an overall game of Hearthstone more fun and compelling, but taking 20+ damage in one turn is not particularly fun or interactive.

[2023-01-05 15:49:14] <@%Uhmge> Leeroy Jenkins created a strategy that revolved around trying to defeat your opponent in one turn without requiring any cards on the board. Fighting for board control and battles between minions make an overall game of Hearthstone more fun and compelling, but taking 20+ damage in one turn is not particularly fun or interactive.
