[2022-12-23 22:48:04] <%AlphaRabbit> I mean JJ does have some goo points. People just disregard him because his thoughts come from the perspective of a rational person who doesn‚Äôt understand Spider-Man as we do

[2022-12-23 22:48:16] <Azzy_Fox> @Lt_Shadow No, he was bonded with Venom at the time and threatening Eddie Brock for photoshopping him into a crime.
[2022-12-23 22:48:18] <hofferTF2> do not underestimate the power of eye dirt

[2022-12-23 22:48:40] <%$highlordtibblesthemighty> Question. So, is Miles a spider mutant like Peter or is he a super tech-geek that's weirdly skilled at parkour?
[2022-12-23 22:48:42] <!%Laimubot> oh yeah these fireworks suck.
[2022-12-23 22:48:47] <%Lt_Shadow> @Azzy_Fox yes sorry thats what I meant but I couldn't remember Venoms name.

[2022-12-23 22:49:50] <%MrThrope> I think the idea is Parker, especially the Toby version, like "Clark Kent" is a bit of a dork. Nerdy old-fashioned raised by grandparents with wholesome family values and an, importantly here, a penchant for out-dated and goofy sounding idioms.
