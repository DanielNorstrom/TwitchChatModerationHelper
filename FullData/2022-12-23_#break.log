[2022-12-23 12:37:02] <%Kiwo> he might enjoy bloodborn more than dark souls
[2022-12-23 12:37:06] <%+MMaRsu> But Tarkov is wiping soon too
[2022-12-23 12:37:09] <%JimmyThickness> I'd love to see how Break handles Dark Souls 1 and 3 after this
[2022-12-23 12:37:15] <%FDeppy> @Kiwo what about GTA RP with break? set up a bike shop and scam people selling them electric bikes brkHmm
[2022-12-23 12:37:19] <%pistrencejx> Sekiro he would enjoy. seeing that
[2022-12-23 12:37:19] <%Kiwo> DS 1 can fuck off
[2022-12-23 12:37:20] <%+MMaRsu> Bloodborne is better than Dark Souls imo
[2022-12-23 12:37:23] <%tez______> Bloodborn Pog
[2022-12-23 12:37:27] <@%Breakspear> Watching MrAtomicDuck 's YT guides helped me out on Project Zomboid. #possiblyanAd
[2022-12-23 12:37:28] <%Kiwo> it's easily the most accessible of all the souls games
[2022-12-23 12:37:28] <%ManSolo> DS1 is great
[2022-12-23 12:37:30] <%JimmyThickness> DS1 is beautiful!
[2022-12-23 12:37:34] <%+MMaRsu> Hell yeah
[2022-12-23 12:37:35] <%Kiwo> DS1 Is a fucking hellscape
[2022-12-23 12:37:35] <+calclaus> imagine Break playing Sekiro pepeLaff
[2022-12-23 12:37:36] <%JimmyThickness> Except for Sif :(
[2022-12-23 12:37:39] <%+MMaRsu> Dark Souls 1 is still great
[2022-12-23 12:37:40] <+Bullets> and its been a blast watching you play it @BreaK
[2022-12-23 12:37:46] <%JonnyTBH> it had a remaster though
[2022-12-23 12:37:46] <%JimmyThickness> 2010?
[2022-12-23 12:37:46] <%Kiwo> i played Demon Souls in 2008/9
[2022-12-23 12:37:46] <%Mikkedin> 2011
[2022-12-23 12:37:47] <Kumakx> ds1 is great but kinda out-dated. There is remaster tho
[2022-12-23 12:37:49] <%+MMaRsu> It has indeed @Bullets
[2022-12-23 12:37:53] <%+RJACE_> demon's souls remake worth too
[2022-12-23 12:37:55] <%ManSolo> DS1 is probably one of the hardest to get into
[2022-12-23 12:38:01] <%kleier> fking burger king wizards
[2022-12-23 12:38:03] <%ManSolo> but imo the best
[2022-12-23 12:38:05] <%3mind> hello Elden Crab

[2022-12-23 12:38:07] <@%Breakspear> ManSolo you're hard to get in to
[2022-12-23 12:38:12] <%Kiwo> Demons Souls was the first
[2022-12-23 12:38:15] <%Kiwo> in 2009
[2022-12-23 12:38:17] <%Untalented> Demon's Souls was the first
[2022-12-23 12:38:18] <%JimmyThickness> yeah DS1 is more recent than you think
[2022-12-23 12:38:20] <%Kiwo> yea
[2022-12-23 12:38:22] <%ManSolo> Breakspear Legendarily so
[2022-12-23 12:38:24] <Kumakx> demon souls is way older
[2022-12-23 12:38:26] <%Kiwo> we had it imported from Japan LUL
[2022-12-23 12:38:31] <%SmokinDave73> 2009
[2022-12-23 12:38:34] <%+MMaRsu> Dark Souls is 2011
[2022-12-23 12:38:35] <%+Jessy103> I would love break to try all of soulsborne
[2022-12-23 12:38:47] <%Kiwo> i think you'd enjoy dark souls 3
[2022-12-23 12:38:47] <Kumakx> but recently demon souls was rereleased
[2022-12-23 12:38:47] <%kleier> sounds about right
[2022-12-23 12:38:50] <%ManSolo> Sounds like you've not changed much break
[2022-12-23 12:38:53] <%Kiwo> DS1 is pretty fucking rough though

[2022-12-23 12:38:54] <%+MMaRsu> Demon Souls/Dark Souls 1/Bloodborne are so good
[2022-12-23 12:39:05] <%Kiwo> OH in DS there is no jump
[2022-12-23 12:39:05] <%SmokinDave73> Dark souls 3 is the most similar to this game
[2022-12-23 12:39:07] <%JimmyThickness> Break is the sort of fucker who would first try O&S in DS1 though but the invisible crystals will destroy him
[2022-12-23 12:39:10] <%kleier> ManSolo he saw a wizard and one brown pixel and was like nah fuck it i'm out KEKUp
[2022-12-23 12:39:12] <%MattTheHuman> DS1 is my favourite
[2022-12-23 12:39:13] <%+MMaRsu> I think this game opened @BreaK s eyes though

[2022-12-23 12:39:32] <RiggsTorvak> i started on ds2 and it took 45mins to kill the first troll
[2022-12-23 12:39:37] <%+Jessy103> or the baby bears
[2022-12-23 12:39:58] <%3mind> EZ
[2022-12-23 12:40:04] <%ManSolo> DS1 with the DLC added has some of the best fights in all the Souls likes. Artorias and Manus are such great fights

[2022-12-23 12:40:19] <%Kiwo> remember there was a time where Break used to take the piss out of me for playing fantasy games
[2022-12-23 12:40:29] <%Kiwo> look at him now
[2022-12-23 12:40:31] <Kumakx> ds2 is the one i enjoyed the most lore-wise, but mechanics were so clunky, replay was hard for me
[2022-12-23 12:40:32] <%+RJACE_> shit spell

[2022-12-23 12:49:49] <mitchellx1992> Double-jumping doesn't make falls any safer or more dangerous, as the game only considers the vertical distance between the ledge you fell from and the ground you ultimately end up on. This means you cannot double jump slightly before landing to protect yourself from a lethal fall.
[2022-12-23 12:49:50] <%+MMaRsu> Total darkness would be awesome, but would make exploring shit at night
[2022-12-23 12:49:54] <+Trav18> This month KEKW

[2022-12-23 12:57:59] <mitchellx1992> you should try jumping over sweep attacks, the iframes when you jump are really really good and allow for an instant attack

[2022-12-23 12:59:20] <%Kiwo> i cleared out a bunch of areas but the bosses are too stressful
[2022-12-23 12:59:21] <%ManSolo> At least in DS you could see if the chest was a mimic from the chain
[2022-12-23 12:59:25] <!%+xT1TANx> kiwo did you play a wizard?
[2022-12-23 12:59:30] <%+MMaRsu> @bigbashbang12 It really is amazing

[2022-12-23 13:00:29] <%+MMaRsu> @bigbashbang12 If youve never played a souls game or anything like it I say take your time, try not to get too frustrated and play the tutorial
[2022-12-23 13:00:34] <@%OutbreakBot> Save £30 off your order with code BULB: http://pcspeciali.st/break
[2022-12-23 13:00:34] <mitchellx1992> @ManSolo if im not mistaken does grace point not show you the direction of the nearest grace?
[2022-12-23 13:00:35] <%Kiwo> it's a banger
[2022-12-23 13:00:42] <%ringstAbekk> don't worry we know you'll do better... eventually
[2022-12-23 13:00:43] <%+MMaRsu> @bigbashbang12 It cant be that hard to learn if @BreaK can master it
[2022-12-23 13:00:45] <%+Tomshepmx> why is Grace always lost

[2022-12-23 13:01:10] <%Kiwo> uhhhhhhh
[2022-12-23 13:01:15] <%Kiwo> i think i stopped because the map is too big
[2022-12-23 13:01:19] <%Kiwo> and it got overwhelming
[2022-12-23 13:01:33] <%ringstAbekk> size can be a problem sometimes
[2022-12-23 13:01:36] <%+Godofdeer> The Seemless Coop mod's pretty great for coop in this game
[2022-12-23 13:01:40] <%Kiwo> i need to search every corner
[2022-12-23 13:01:44] <%Kiwo> so it got exhausting
[2022-12-23 13:01:51] <+moosE3knucklE> i took a break after fighting melania 100 times and dieing. lol i cant wait to watch break fight her
[2022-12-23 13:01:56] <%+MMaRsu> You know you dont have to explore every corner :P

[2022-12-23 13:02:28] <%+Tomshepmx> ye I couldn't handle a game where you can potentially miss 1 tiny item. I'd need to get everything too.
[2022-12-23 13:02:29] <%Kiwo> just exploring
[2022-12-23 13:02:32] <+moosE3knucklE> i feel you there kiwo i wanna own every piece of armor and sword in the game and beat all the bosses.
[2022-12-23 13:02:36] <%JimmyThickness> if this map had a blue circle then break would be out searching every corner
[2022-12-23 13:02:41] <%Kiwo> but i suck at fighting bosses

[2022-12-23 13:03:11] <Snapdraco> When you roll you cover your armor in it
[2022-12-23 13:03:12] <numendisal> when you roll you got that shit on you
[2022-12-23 13:03:13] <%+Pneumoniac> When you roll it sticks to you
[2022-12-23 13:03:13] <%tez______> No
[2022-12-23 13:03:14] <%ManSolo> Roll makes it stick to you

[2022-12-23 13:03:19] <%+Godofdeer> no its cause you rolled
[2022-12-23 13:03:21] <%Cartster> DEADGE inbound
[2022-12-23 13:03:22] <%+randomcallsign> the roll sticks to you
[2022-12-23 13:03:22] <!%+xT1TANx> it's ticking down
[2022-12-23 13:03:25] <%+Godofdeer> so you got coated in it
[2022-12-23 13:03:25] <%JimmyThickness> in the other room i think
[2022-12-23 13:03:25] <%Hopsecution> you rolled earlier
[2022-12-23 13:03:29] <%ZENDRY> no
[2022-12-23 13:03:31] <alanfordnr1> it lingers on your clothes

[2022-12-23 13:03:41] <%Hopsecution> but you rolled
[2022-12-23 13:03:42] <%+Pneumoniac> You may have some balls to cure it
[2022-12-23 13:03:43] <%FDeppy> better reset
[2022-12-23 13:03:44] <@%Breakspear> Why does the background sounds sound like an unbalanced washing machine on a fast spin?
[2022-12-23 13:03:45] <%ManSolo> Rolling makes the rot stick so it stays on you after you leave it
[2022-12-23 13:03:45] <%FDeppy> youre gonna die
[2022-12-23 13:03:46] <%+dootplays> shit THIS community :(
[2022-12-23 13:03:47] <Buttzyy> you rolled in the rot so it sticks regardless
[2022-12-23 13:03:47] <%JimmyThickness> when you roll is clings to you faster
[2022-12-23 13:03:47] <%+randomcallsign> use boluses

[2022-12-23 13:03:50] <%+Godofdeer> If you roll in the rot or posion it coats your clothing basically
[2022-12-23 13:03:50] <@%GreggStrat> Do you have any Preserving Boluses?
[2022-12-23 13:03:51] <%Devs1976> check your inventory for balls to get rid of it
[2022-12-23 13:03:53] <Snapdraco> No but it sticks to your armor so it ramps up even when you are out of the rot
[2022-12-23 13:03:53] <%+Pneumoniac> Check your balls
[2022-12-23 13:03:53] <+Agitated_Snail> check pink bolus

[2022-12-23 13:38:42] <%ZCrimes> @Rixstarian The notoriously difficult boss in Elden Ring, Starscourge Radahn, has now been buffed back up to full strength following an accidental nerf. This was the result of a recently released patch for the game which fixed a bug in the balancing system that weakened several attacks.

[2022-12-23 13:53:03] <Rixstarian> @ZCrimes That sounds about right. I thought his magic was weaker, but it might just be the slower projectile speed ensuring not all of them hit.

[2022-12-23 14:21:53] <%Clarkefruit> Cheer300 Got home from work the other day and sat to chill when my son came in. Asked what I was doing, so told him. Daddy's just going to do video games for a bit. He got all excited, asked if he could watch so I booted up my new copy of Elden Ring. As soon as the title screen hit he just lost all excitement. Few minutes later he got up and said. I'm going to see what Mommy's doing. Then he left. Have I done something wrong as a father? Should I love him less? Maybe he's correct 💀🕹️
[2022-12-23 14:21:53] <%numendisal> it was the crater

[2022-12-23 15:16:17] <%MitosisDNB> @ZCrimes debatable with tiche
[2022-12-23 15:16:26] <+moosE3knucklE> i use the black knife tiche over mimic
[2022-12-23 15:16:42] <%JimmyThickness> Tiche is good too true, but I feel I can rely on mimic more
[2022-12-23 15:16:43] <%ZCrimes> tiche imo isn't great for a lot of fights, whereas mimic doesn't care LULW
[2022-12-23 15:16:44] <%psilisophic> I use Finlay, tiche, and mimic pretty interchangeably

[2022-12-23 15:24:06] <%SmokinDave73> @JonnyTBH it just means you get diminishing returns if you level certain stats above 40
[2022-12-23 15:24:08] <%+MMaRsu> I think its 40
[2022-12-23 15:24:09] <Rixstarian> There's different soft caps.
[2022-12-23 15:24:13] <%MitosisDNB> you'll still make good gains if you have high scaling up to 60 though

[2022-12-23 16:11:41] <Dylbert_> @MMaRsu it's not that bad once you know the controlls but they are incredible scuffed compared to other games

[2022-12-23 16:12:02] <%+MMaRsu> @Dylbert_ Yeah mouse and keyboard support in japanese games is mostly shit
[2022-12-23 16:12:14] <Dylbert_> @MMaRsu True actually
[2022-12-23 16:12:28] <limpzii> eeh it feels the same as the rest
[2022-12-23 16:12:28] <+Loki57_> but controller is still ideal imo
[2022-12-23 16:12:29] <Drensky> oh damn this area
[2022-12-23 16:12:43] <%+MMaRsu> @Dylbert_ Maybe just general pc support from japanese games haha. But I love them

[2022-12-23 16:25:36] <IDUELiiST> If it's 3v1 then do it
[2022-12-23 16:25:46] <+Loki57_> doing it without summons is super satisfying, radahn was my favorite to pull off
[2022-12-23 16:25:47] <%+Mr_Nezbit> the summons are cool but them stealing aggro for ANY time from bosses completely changes the game
[2022-12-23 16:25:48] <%+Mr_Nezbit> but it's good
[2022-12-23 16:25:50] <IDUELiiST> Just for satisfaction brotherman

[2022-12-23 16:56:30] <+Loki57_> keen or bloody would probably be best

[2022-12-23 16:56:43] <%+DaveNF> Yes
[2022-12-23 16:56:43] <+Loki57_> the affinities change the scaling of the weapon so your stats make better use of it @BreaK

[2022-12-23 16:56:54] <mitchellx1992> you would need 2 of it
[2022-12-23 16:57:16] <mitchellx1992> you only have 1 copy of that ash of war
[2022-12-23 16:57:24] <%pistrencejx> blood slash damage could be 1K now? could test it
[2022-12-23 16:57:28] VIEWERS: 804
[2022-12-23 16:57:34] <%Devs1976> dont matter
[2022-12-23 16:57:39] <+Loki57_> he wont use the ash but he could have more bleed buildup or better dex scaling right?
[2022-12-23 16:57:39] <%SmokinDave73> can you have 2 different ash of war ability is you dual wield?
[2022-12-23 16:57:43] <%Devs1976> your lead hand weapon will obly ever proc
[2022-12-23 16:57:43] <sam_aeal> check the rememberance
[2022-12-23 16:57:44] <sanosuk3> blood loss build up will increase with bloody slash

[2022-12-23 16:57:51] <%twilezu> L2 uses only primary weapon ability
[2022-12-23 16:57:56] <%SmokinDave73> if*
[2022-12-23 16:57:56] <mitchellx1992> you cant use the special attack on your off hand
[2022-12-23 16:57:56] <Thadorus> L2 uses your main hand ability
[2022-12-23 16:58:12] <DonerStoom> this is your special move, you can't have 2 special moves at the same time because you only have one special move button
[2022-12-23 16:58:16] <Thadorus> L1 is attack with both weapon
[2022-12-23 16:58:16] <%+DaveNF> L1 doesn't exists and anyone who says otherwise is a liar
[2022-12-23 16:58:26] <%twilezu> l1 is the same always
[2022-12-23 16:58:27] <%pistrencejx> think right hand has the special move
[2022-12-23 16:58:29] <mitchellx1992> bloody slash then keen
[2022-12-23 16:58:30] <%Devs1976> no
[2022-12-23 16:58:40] <%+Beastwood95> there is a point
[2022-12-23 16:58:41] <+poonaniest> the "ability" can only be used on the left hand weapon if you put it in 2 hands
[2022-12-23 16:58:42] <Thadorus> no but you could set bleed or keen affinity if it gives more damage
[2022-12-23 16:58:46] <%Line_Noise> You still get the stat bonus
[2022-12-23 16:58:50] <%+Beastwood95> you choose which honing you want on your weapon
[2022-12-23 16:58:51] <+Loki57_> even if the ash doesnt get used it will scale better or have more bleed buildup so its worth
[2022-12-23 16:58:52] <+poonaniest> the bonuses and attributes do matter
[2022-12-23 16:58:56] <sanosuk3> it increases blood loss buildup right passively
[2022-12-23 16:59:12] <Drensky> yes

[2022-12-23 16:59:27] <mitchellx1992> id go keen but no massive difference

[2022-12-23 16:59:36] <%SmokinDave73> it would be a waste not to use your arcane levels now
[2022-12-23 16:59:40] <%Line_Noise> Less damage more bleed
[2022-12-23 16:59:42] <%pistrencejx> definitely could try blood slash
[2022-12-23 16:59:43] <+Loki57_> slightly less dmg but way more bleed buildup
[2022-12-23 16:59:49] <%Untalented> a little, but its worth to procc your bleeding faster
[2022-12-23 16:59:58] <%Devs1976> you will soon change you main weapon, well a little later when you find the best ash for katana's
[2022-12-23 17:00:06] <mitchellx1992> you dont have keen, my bad
[2022-12-23 17:00:10] <Drensky> can keep it at standard for now, but bleed procs will be slightly faster
[2022-12-23 17:00:28] <%pistrencejx> your last grace, rest at grace, pass time till night. then rest at grace again but don't pass time.

[2022-12-23 17:00:57] <sanosuk3> if your gonna level up arcane with dex then put the blood one on both weapons
