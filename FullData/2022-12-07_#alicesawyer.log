[2022-12-07 23:40:32] <@%xsolus> what can u do, their shell makes their DEF too high for conventional weapons
[2022-12-07 23:40:38] <derpaton> if you squash snails it attracts more snails because they are notorious canibals
[2022-12-07 23:40:55] <%UnclePutte> that was a very comedic dynamite
[2022-12-07 23:40:58] <@%achievementguy> @xsolus jump on them  so you can pick up the shell to relocate them
[2022-12-07 23:41:04] <esinahkalaukku> Reminds me the spanish slug has been spreading across europe and idk why but that kinda freaks me out LUL

[2022-12-07 23:41:25] <Lyles_VT> roaches will eat other roaches too, I smashed a big one and seen it half eaten by another *shivers*
[2022-12-07 23:41:39] <@%achievementguy> unlike us, animals are free of sin
[2022-12-07 23:41:46] <@%xsolus> then how do u explain this picture of u putting a funny little hog in a blender

[2022-12-07 23:42:58] <derpaton> if we get roaches too im gonna mald. I hate roaches and im very pleased that there are no native roaches
[2022-12-07 23:42:59] <Lyles_VT> Tiger snails are probably the only snail large enough to pet, like a slimy kitty
