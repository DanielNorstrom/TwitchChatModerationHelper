[2023-01-10 20:10:31] <%+MaheTM> I don't like Kameto as a french cast because he doesn't care about the game outside of the TMWT season. Not healthy for the game...

[2023-01-10 20:10:59] <$Hatchet302> I feel like trying to have every org have a caster instead of just having one central cast like other esports (e.g. csgo), is just shooting themselves in the foot in the long term
