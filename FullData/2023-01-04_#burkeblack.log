[2023-01-04 04:54:24] <@%+jstubbles> @Cairax_Annages Am I right in assuming, if the heart STOPS - they shouldn't be using a defib, right? Just chest compressions? I thought defibs are just to fix hearth rhythm issue?

[2023-01-04 05:22:24] <%djuice_> You can have real guns on stream as a background, other streamers like DonutOperator, Klean, BrandonHerrara has guns on their walls or in the background, and its perfectly fine
[2023-01-04 05:22:28] <%+Panda_c260> battlestate games, tarkovs devs, got banned in 2019 for pointing a realistic looking toy gun at one of the people on streams head, if they did it again just shows they're not the brightest
[2023-01-04 05:22:28] <HenshinBob> There's one I saw where some genius accidentally shot a cup on his desk.

[2023-01-04 05:23:58] <%+Panda_c260> @XxpireD cause the point a gun at someone on stream was a 14 day ban in 2019, would be surprised if they did it again after that lol

[2023-01-04 05:28:03] <%+Panda_c260> so apparently the reason the tarkov devs got banned this time is someone on the stream pretended to spray a gas cannister as everyone else came on stream, nothing to do with a gun

[2023-01-04 05:47:14] <%+WastingSanity> @BurkeBlack I forget what state, but they passed a law where police can not remove a trespasser anymore. They can ticket them, but they can not remove them. Even if it is a private residence.
[2023-01-04 05:47:16] <%OldGamerJooky> no laws on west coast

[2023-01-04 05:47:28] <notNOTjack> it's probably all about insurance, since most stores have their goods insured if the crime isn't violent it will just be up to the insurance companies to access and cover the damages

[2023-01-04 06:08:11] <+thehivemind1> Overused Boomer term
[2023-01-04 06:08:12] <%$dangerousgoods> 20 years or more is considered classic
[2023-01-04 06:08:15] <Ferc8> boomer meme is the 30 year old boomer meme meaning someone who does not like to accept new things and it is misrepresented to hell and back, I'll try not to die on this hill Kappa
[2023-01-04 06:08:17] <$Maltidas> @SGTCARAMELNOODLE igaHi
[2023-01-04 06:08:21] <+Wychlight> You are making the complaints like the actual old people do about there not being any Chuck Berry music
[2023-01-04 06:08:23] <galtakie> I thought Xx ended 80s. and millennials from there
[2023-01-04 06:08:24] <%NoobxxNoob> these boomers don't even know what a boomer is Kappa
[2023-01-04 06:08:26] <%xen_mind> it's an ageist term
[2023-01-04 06:08:30] <%+WastingSanity> basically

[2023-01-04 06:08:38] <%MarkRH> I mostly listen to classic rock stations in the car.  At home I listen to all kinds of stuff I've collected over the years.. Classical, New Age, Caltic, Country, Heavy Metal, Electronic...etc
[2023-01-04 06:08:39] <Ronan37> It has been overdone.
[2023-01-04 06:08:39] <%+Atreyu4800> boomer just means old yeah
[2023-01-04 06:08:42] <%djuice_> If music is 30 years ago, you must be late 40s and early 50s
[2023-01-04 06:08:50] <%+Mangyanimal> People getting upset about the term boomer is very boomer Kappa
[2023-01-04 06:08:51] <%+WastingSanity> boomer became a slang term
[2023-01-04 06:08:51] <%britedog> old isn't bad term
[2023-01-04 06:08:52] <wolfscout1950> out of current trend in another word
[2023-01-04 06:08:53] <%Lerekh> Words used to mean something then all the Gen z types come around and make new words for stuff

[2023-01-04 06:09:07] <+thehivemind1> Using Boomer is like hating Nickleback... it became popular
[2023-01-04 06:09:09] <%Malfunction141> back in my day
[2023-01-04 06:09:10] <OldManMaple> 90's rock is classic rock,  2000's rock is classic rock... in 5 more years 2010 rock is classic rock

[2023-01-04 06:47:15] <%+r8gato> The game company I work for already uses AI to generate quick concept art. So, I would argue it's already taking some jobs/hrs from potential concept artists in the game industry.
[2023-01-04 06:47:22] <$nicademice> personally burkeblack, AI Art may actually make art made by humans more valuable, think about it, AI Art would be easy to produce making it cheep, but a piece done by hand would be much more work, making it more valuable

[2023-01-04 06:47:47] <notNOTjack> art is a ultra competitive space, any number of AI users taking work from artists is already a huge problem. Besides one of the major issues being how these AI's use art without the artists' consent.

[2023-01-04 11:27:33] <+Techno_Mage> We sail the seas in search of gold, Our pockets always hungry, never bold. We'll take and plunder, steal and loot, Until our hold is full, there's no room to refute.  Hark! What do I spy on the horizon's edge? A ship ripe for the plundering, a sight to bepledge. We'll board and capture, take what's ours, The ship and its treasure, a pirate's true powers.

We are the pirates, feared by all, Our reputation for plundering, a story to be told. We'll sail the seas, in search of more, Our thirst for treasure, forever to endure
