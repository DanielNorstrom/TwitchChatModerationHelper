[2023-01-01 08:35:06] <%TheTrueCatMan> it is secret fat garth image on top of yellow discs of money
[2023-01-01 08:35:39] <%TheTrueCatMan> probably need to outline yellow disks so they stand out more and brighten garnth

[2023-01-01 08:58:44] <@%Scytal_> it's mainly garth he's hard to make out the coins are good guuNODDERS
[2023-01-01 08:59:12] <%TheTrueCatMan> Maybe its bad source material and it will take more to make it look good :\
