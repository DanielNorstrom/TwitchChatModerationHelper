[2022-12-10 07:35:31] <%Lungjuice> @AkeenSin From wiki: Martian Madness is a Hardmode, post-Golem invasion-style event that includes several alien-themed enemies. It can only be triggered after Golem has been defeated.  Martian Madness is triggered by a Martian Probe, which spawns randomly in the two outer lateral thirds of the map (with a higher spawn chance in the Space layer). "

[2022-12-10 10:36:45] <@%^Streamlabs> Rolled 52, @BaosilisK won 200 Bazinga Bongos and now has 1145 Bazinga Bongos
[2022-12-10 10:37:02] <%BaosilisK> why i didn't gamba everything this time GAMBAADDICT
[2022-12-10 10:37:10] <ThanDone> not die 4Head
[2022-12-10 10:37:16] <choiyerims> upgrade weapons and accessories
[2022-12-10 10:37:28] <%BaosilisK> i guess y'all can work on accessories ye
[2022-12-10 10:37:37] <ImKrezai> what you saw was probably the forbidden armour that you need to get forbidden fragments and ademantite to make
[2022-12-10 10:38:06] <%alrightsimon> also i found a way to put money on my steam wallet i thought it was impossible after my country got cancelled LUL back to being a gamer
[2022-12-10 10:38:14] <%BaosilisK> but look at the defense it gives
[2022-12-10 10:38:45] <ChemicaaLz> I think harpy wings will be the best one you can get atm
[2022-12-10 10:38:47] <choiyerims> forbidden fragments are grindy at this stage
[2022-12-10 10:38:53] <ImKrezai> you get forbidden fragments from a desert mini boss during a sand storm
[2022-12-10 10:39:07] <koumajou> sandstorms happen during a windy day
[2022-12-10 10:39:15] <%BaosilisK> oh they can do that rn ImKrezai ? pogg

[2022-12-10 10:39:30] <%BaosilisK> forbidden would be an upgrade ye

[2022-12-10 10:41:22] <%BaosilisK> ye mini bosses kick asses but its probably easier than slime queen
[2022-12-10 10:41:26] <ImKrezai> upgrades you can get now is the forbidden armour and the cool whip. but you need to grind mini bosses to get both of them
[2022-12-10 10:41:41] <ImKrezai> that is the annoying part
[2022-12-10 10:42:05] <%Mentalpathy> ouo

[2022-12-10 11:29:09] <%mangbroke> oh getting giant feathers is annoying
[2022-12-10 11:29:17] <%cyberchig> Too bad royal gel is garbage
[2022-12-10 11:29:25] <%mangbroke> I find getting the demon wings easier imo
[2022-12-10 11:29:32] <+corneliuscummins> I think the best staff for right now that attainable is the pirate staff
[2022-12-10 11:29:36] <rayymmond> Oh yeah you could also invest into an imbuing station to make flasks as well for more dps
[2022-12-10 11:29:52] <%+3buucks> i went with demon wings out of luck alone kinda the same as harpy last time i remember
[2022-12-10 11:30:17] <%mangbroke> yea it's the same I think demons are easier to kill imo
[2022-12-10 11:30:18] <rayymmond> Imbuing station from the witch doctor btw
[2022-12-10 11:30:20] <%BaosilisK> i usually buy the dryad one
[2022-12-10 11:30:33] <%+Manicteddie> @aleks so you have two options for a new staff either the saguine staff or the optic staff... optic you need to kill the twins which is the first main boss of hardmode you will need his souls of sight hallow bars and 2 lens and 1 black lens... optic is going to amazing for a long run mostly because it got lasers like a rave
[2022-12-10 11:30:55] <%+3buucks> @mangbroke ^^^
[2022-12-10 11:30:56] <ThanDone> you got hella regular feathers by now
[2022-12-10 11:31:06] <Vanesco> gachiHYPER
[2022-12-10 11:31:14] <koumajou> harpy wings requires a giant harpy feather
[2022-12-10 11:31:19] <%+3buucks> optic staff is fire
[2022-12-10 11:31:20] <%+3buucks> lol
[2022-12-10 11:31:20] <@%^Streamlabs> ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ
[2022-12-10 11:31:21] <%pepperballista> optic staff also my personal favorite, fashion wise
[2022-12-10 11:32:03] <%BaosilisK> peepoRun
[2022-12-10 11:32:12] <%mangbroke> flame wings need a fire feather
[2022-12-10 11:32:39] <%Lungjuice> get the wings before twins
[2022-12-10 11:32:43] <ChemicaaLz> also, melee speed accessories affect whip speed too, so getting the feral claws upgrades can be beneficial for that quick whipping ppOverHeat
[2022-12-10 11:32:51] <%mangbroke> yea wings are a must have for sure
[2022-12-10 11:32:51] <rayymmond> Yeah I don’t think you’ll be getting optic staff anytime soon
[2022-12-10 11:32:52] <%pepperballista> well you can skip some bosses and come back to them later
[2022-12-10 11:33:02] <+corneliuscummins> Pirate staff has a .5%- 1% to drop from pirates and it’s like the goblin invasion
[2022-12-10 11:33:02] <rayymmond> Optic staff isn’t that worth it
[2022-12-10 11:33:23] <%+3buucks> i think you guys can handle the twins aleksH
[2022-12-10 11:33:25] <%Lungjuice> also having wings lets you slow down during falls to reneutralise fall damage
[2022-12-10 11:33:32] <%mangbroke> ^
[2022-12-10 11:33:37] <%+3buucks> focusing the beam fucker is crucial
[2022-12-10 11:33:37] <%cyberchig> Get everyone to help you kill the blood moon mini boss
[2022-12-10 11:33:44] <%alrightsimon> any Pog bosses soon? modCheck
[2022-12-10 11:33:50] <rayymmond> Sanguine staff is from the dreadnautilus you fish up during the blood moon
[2022-12-10 11:33:56] <%BaosilisK> get everyone and farm all minibosses would be good for everyone
[2022-12-10 11:34:03] <%cyberchig> Peace candle

[2022-12-10 11:34:25] <ChemicaaLz> @Lungjuice no need to slow down the fall, wings make immune to fall damage altogether

[2022-12-10 12:12:54] <ChemicaaLz> funny enough, Ruthless is best prefix for summons since they don't benefit from most other perks, so damage perk is best
[2022-12-10 12:12:56] <%mangbroke> AlienDance AlienDance
[2022-12-10 12:13:00] <ImKrezai> the best prefixes are Unreal for ranged. legendary for melee. mythical for magic. and defense or damage 4 for the accesorys
[2022-12-10 12:13:22] <%mangbroke> Sadly a lot of the crate stuff and drops from the sea are mostly useful pre hardmode
[2022-12-10 12:13:28] <%mangbroke> but they're good money

[2022-12-10 12:34:29] <Zreaper_> very cool. the spiders probably do more but these will hit more often
[2022-12-10 12:34:31] <Swargwarn> but which way are the daggers spinning above your head?

[2022-12-10 12:35:09] <+corneliuscummins> These are better since I’m master mode everything has high defense so I think they are better

[2022-12-10 12:35:53] <%cyberchig> It’s bad
[2022-12-10 12:35:56] <%pepperballista> tinker might want it cuz it has plus 4 defense
[2022-12-10 12:36:13] <%+viollama> it got buffed but im pretty sure its still kinda bad
[2022-12-10 12:36:49] <anextremeemo> morning chat
[2022-12-10 12:36:53] <anextremeemo> Wokege
[2022-12-10 12:36:57] <anextremeemo> and streamer I guess
[2022-12-10 12:37:09] <@%ken_mayor> @anextremeemo GoodMorning
[2022-12-10 12:37:11] <%BaosilisK> 1 damage KEKW
[2022-12-10 12:37:24] <%+viollama> try using spider and see if they del more dmg
[2022-12-10 12:37:24] <rayymmond> You can
[2022-12-10 12:37:25] <se_nor> you can have one of each kind
[2022-12-10 12:37:34] <%mangbroke> It does really low damage tho
[2022-12-10 12:37:35] <%pepperballista> the dam is crazy though
[2022-12-10 12:37:35] <rayymmond> Just click each staff a little amount each
[2022-12-10 12:37:36] <%mangbroke> Hmm
[2022-12-10 12:37:38] <+Oepoepoepoe> you can have different summons, but why use the shit ones when you get a better one
[2022-12-10 12:37:46] <Zreaper_> Yeah, damage is low but the tracking on them is really good
[2022-12-10 12:37:49] <%BaosilisK> i dunno spider might be better ye
[2022-12-10 12:37:58] <choiyerims> they'll do extra to whatever you whip
[2022-12-10 12:37:59] <%+Manicteddie> @aleks try pirates now seems like yall can do it
[2022-12-10 12:37:59] <%BaosilisK> not for flying things tho
[2022-12-10 12:38:01] <%cyberchig> They stagger
[2022-12-10 12:38:04] <%mangbroke> I assume optic staff is still better tho?
[2022-12-10 12:38:19] <+corneliuscummins> Nah
[2022-12-10 12:38:25] <se_nor> i believe the knive can only attack thru walls
[2022-12-10 12:38:25] <+corneliuscummins> Lil slow
[2022-12-10 12:38:42] <ImKrezai> the good thing about the swords is that they track enemies a lot better. most of the time in that slime fight the spiders weren't even hitting it
[2022-12-10 12:38:48] <rayymmond> Optic staff might be bad only because the attacks might miss
[2022-12-10 12:38:50] <+corneliuscummins> CTRL
[2022-12-10 12:39:09] <ChemicaaLz> tracking summons are generally better
[2022-12-10 12:39:21] <%bluu_mynT> Wait no dps meter?
[2022-12-10 12:39:25] <+corneliuscummins> Yeah it’s weird
[2022-12-10 12:39:47] <%pepperballista> also if you guys havent tried it you can share summon staffs so everyone can have a lil knife over their head
[2022-12-10 12:40:10] <%mangbroke> Oh yea might as well give everyone a summon

[2022-12-10 12:43:17] <%Lungjuice> no crimson in your world, only corruption
[2022-12-10 12:43:20] <%+viollama> you need to create the other evil biome since your world dont have it

[2022-12-10 12:44:11] <%pepperballista> crimson is an alternative to corruption, worlds can only corruption OR crimson, so you cant get them unless you make a crimson biome
[2022-12-10 12:44:12] <ImKrezai> you can make a crimson biome. the dryad has crimson seeds
[2022-12-10 12:44:24] <rayymmond> You can make the biome buy placing the dryad in the corrupted biome

[2022-12-10 13:33:31] <%mangbroke> Yea I think crate potions are hurting your chances
[2022-12-10 13:33:33] <+corneliuscummins> Inventory a mess lol

[2022-12-10 13:33:48] <%BaosilisK> jelly is a bait ?
[2022-12-10 13:33:56] <%Lungjuice> bait power good for fishing stuff, helps speed and rarity
[2022-12-10 13:34:26] <Vanesco> bait this SUSSY
[2022-12-10 13:34:33] <%Lungjuice> @BaosilisK you can fish up special bait/item jelly, different from enemy jelly
[2022-12-10 13:34:51] <%Lungjuice> cant just net a wild enemy jelly
[2022-12-10 13:34:54] <%Lungjuice> sadly
[2022-12-10 13:35:39] <%mangbroke> Tinky is having a blast with that ship
[2022-12-10 13:35:52] <Vanesco> tink Gladge
[2022-12-10 13:35:56] <%mangbroke> Hopefully the next time you do a pirate invasion you get the black spot as well
[2022-12-10 13:35:58] <%BaosilisK> looks like there's a special fishing pole for fishing ennemies btw
[2022-12-10 13:36:31] <doscomputer> tinker is a master architect
[2022-12-10 13:37:23] <%BaosilisK> wait nvm i think its a modded thing wiki is confusing
[2022-12-10 13:37:46] <%mangbroke> Yea they were doing it the right way
[2022-12-10 13:38:05] <%+Manicteddie> yo aint going to lie i really like tinker tower you guys should upload the map sometime to the workshop
[2022-12-10 13:38:27] <%BaosilisK> is the chum caster not a vanilla thing ?
[2022-12-10 13:38:39] <doscomputer> blow up the hive
[2022-12-10 13:38:58] <prazzza> the primal urge to start a terraria playthrough every 3 months
[2022-12-10 13:39:00] <prazzza> love this game
[2022-12-10 13:39:15] <%bluu_mynT> The chum bucket is vanilla
[2022-12-10 13:40:48] <@%ken_mayor> the chum bucket is plankton's restaurant
[2022-12-10 13:41:05] <%BaosilisK> spongebob peepoGiggles
[2022-12-10 13:41:23] <%mangbroke> Aleks it may be worth considering getting some sonar potions
[2022-12-10 13:42:02] <%BaosilisK> PauseChamp
[2022-12-10 13:42:13] <rayymmond> Honey takes longer to fish in btw
[2022-12-10 13:42:24] <choiyerims> you're probably better off finding another give with a bigger pond
[2022-12-10 13:42:38] <choiyerims> hive
[2022-12-10 13:42:48] <cyronh> oh damn, the terraria grind is real huh ?
[2022-12-10 13:42:52] <cyronh> hello people :)
[2022-12-10 13:42:59] <%BaosilisK> heyy cyronh
[2022-12-10 13:42:59] <%+SinisterVB> could need more honey before fish show up
[2022-12-10 13:43:00] <rayymmond> Pond needs to be bigger though
[2022-12-10 13:43:08] <%+viollama> trying to fish in a pudle
[2022-12-10 13:43:22] <rayymmond> 300 blocks minimum
[2022-12-10 13:44:06] <%BaosilisK> beeBlob
[2022-12-10 13:44:18] <%Lungjuice> 300 blocks ensures you have no reduction in fishing rating thingy due to pond size
[2022-12-10 13:44:18] <rayymmond> I meant 200 blocks minimum that was a typo
[2022-12-10 13:44:37] <%mangbroke> The honey life is a hard one
[2022-12-10 13:44:53] <%+SinisterVB> its 50 minimum, 200 makes it optimal but 50 can work
[2022-12-10 13:44:56] <rayymmond> But 300 is optimal

[2022-12-10 13:45:44] <%+SinisterVB> should still make it optimal in the future.  not onlywill you get more honey quests, but some fish make good potions
[2022-12-10 13:45:45] <%Lungjuice> or use LOTS of bucketing
[2022-12-10 13:46:16] <Dragarai> not enough honey
[2022-12-10 13:46:16] <%BaosilisK> suraciPain
[2022-12-10 13:46:20] <doscomputer> I still vote for the explosive option
[2022-12-10 13:46:26] <%+SinisterVB> i do know of a way using pumps and wiring to make infinite honey
[2022-12-10 13:46:27] <%+Manicteddie> this is a great fishing trip
[2022-12-10 13:46:30] <%+Manicteddie> very chill

[2022-12-10 13:47:16] <%Lungjuice> a fishing quest for honey fish also has a decent chance of giving something useful for it too
