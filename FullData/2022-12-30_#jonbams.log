[2022-12-30 16:51:03] <%+Kenekeu> As a general rule, minimum wage is usually the same amount as a fast food meal. If you raise minimum wage, the cost of a fast food meal rises to match ending up not providing any gain because when the cost of producing the food rises, the price of the food must also rise to match.
