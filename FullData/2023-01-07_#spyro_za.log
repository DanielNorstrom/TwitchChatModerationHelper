[2023-01-07 10:10:25] <Crayonfart_> peepoGamble
[2023-01-07 10:10:33] <DeraJN> it makes sense to snap on 50/50
[2023-01-07 10:10:40] <swift167> It's NY, anything can  happen
[2023-01-07 10:10:45] <DeraJN> because your odds of winning only going up because they can retreat
[2023-01-07 10:11:16] <+Smarzy> retreat equity
[2023-01-07 10:11:23] <DeraJN> they still retreat thinking you have the winning play and they don't
[2023-01-07 10:11:50] <swift167> got shang chi for the monster, it's a snap
[2023-01-07 10:11:56] <DeraJN> they never know your hand and they know their own. sometimes their hand is just garbage

[2023-01-07 10:20:02] <BM844> its playable with maximus and shit
[2023-01-07 10:20:02] <Ezras> @Spyro_ZA check shop
[2023-01-07 10:20:03] <LIANEGE> @ERB0L gwent is dead unfortunately
[2023-01-07 10:20:04] <+Benelioto> ronan is one of the worst for sure
[2023-01-07 10:20:06] VIEWERS: 201
[2023-01-07 10:20:10] <BM844> the worse is like crystal, baron mordo etc
[2023-01-07 10:20:24] <ERB0L> in snap you grind for cards
[2023-01-07 10:20:24] <BM844> @Benelioto its not
[2023-01-07 10:20:36] <Crayonfart_> @BM844 + quake
[2023-01-07 10:20:51] <@^StreamElements> Type !deck to view all the decks I am currently using
[2023-01-07 10:20:55] <Basmal> what sucks is even grinding this game doesn't reward much
[2023-01-07 10:20:59] <LIANEGE> @Spyro_ZA it's a bad thing for a free game
[2023-01-07 10:21:04] <Iwilljoy> Ronan is good with Sandman and Maksimus
[2023-01-07 10:21:07] <+Benelioto> @BM844 one of top 10 worst cards
[2023-01-07 10:21:08] <BM844> snap has all the addictive gacha mechanics u can imagine
[2023-01-07 10:21:12] <BM844> @Benelioto its not
[2023-01-07 10:21:16] <Iwilljoy> So it for future
[2023-01-07 10:21:21] <nyx_naganohara> and this is why gwent never made much money imo

[2023-01-07 10:21:42] <+rotello1> yeah gwent and snap are on the opposite sides of the monetization scheme
[2023-01-07 10:21:43] <RaunoSaul> you cant really grind cards in snap LUL only thing you can grind is battle pass lvls buts that it
[2023-01-07 10:21:45] <Basmal> ronan thins your opps deck by 1 for free who cares it cost 6
[2023-01-07 10:21:49] <%+Smarzy> i do really like the retreat system, because it's more about managing long term cube equity
[2023-01-07 10:21:59] <inther4> skip round 4?
[2023-01-07 10:22:06] VIEWERS: 207
[2023-01-07 10:22:06] <+rotello1> the fact is, spending money in snap is never a good idea unless you go full whale mode
[2023-01-07 10:22:10] <Basmal> literally worse than yondu
[2023-01-07 10:22:54] <BM844> @Benelioto adam warlock, baron mordo, black bolt, black cat, crystal, drax, hazmat, quake, yellowjacket
[2023-01-07 10:22:56] <BM844> there u go 10 worse cards
[2023-01-07 10:23:02] <+rotello1> like dropping 10 bucks or 20,doesnt do anything
[2023-01-07 10:23:04] <BM844> @Basmal thats not ronan my dude
[2023-01-07 10:23:11] <BM844> !card ronan the accuser

[2023-01-07 12:21:08] <steeldeity06> now this is gonna sound iffy but as a player around 2k collection level and infinite for 3 seasons, i think you should buy Zola. Now before the 5heads in chat kill me, hear me out: Zola is telegraphed and people see him coming but not on dino and especially not on your collection level. zola's surprise value in on reveal decks is got me to infinite my first season at early collection level. this is my opinion @spyro_za
[2023-01-07 12:21:09] <BM844> i love these hot takes

[2023-01-07 15:36:09] <AfatSUMO> the problem was just that you didnt want to play in the superflow so you clogged mid when you already didnt want the extra mana

[2023-01-07 17:34:02] <PeterPark79> its a matter of morality should i risk it. or take the money :). but the point its real clear not always go to forfit. you could win
[2023-01-07 17:34:09] <%+TVkun2> And the points were almost even. I would call that a 50/50
[2023-01-07 17:34:18] <Zentimuz> it’s not only a 50/50 there are other things at play

[2023-01-07 17:40:25] VIEWERS: 323
[2023-01-07 17:40:39] <steeldeity06> if we take this dino 50/50 situation as an example, all the high level streamers that are climbing will retreat, here's why: because in this game winrate doesn't matter, cube rate matters. focus on this: having a chance that you may lose 4/8 cubes should never be taken by a player who's climbing. that's how it works. you can always win cubes later but taking the chance of losing 4-8 cubes is not worth it
[2023-01-07 17:41:00] <hyperion100> wrong
[2023-01-07 17:41:09] <Zentimuz> I agreege

[2023-01-07 18:37:06] <@^StreamElements> steeldeity06 just subscribed for 2 months in a row PogChamp
[2023-01-07 18:37:56] <%steeldeity06> C3 deck pog
[2023-01-07 18:37:59] <DoomToWin> cerebro 3 play litch as well
[2023-01-07 18:38:01] <+Jekkfje> cerebro 3
[2023-01-07 18:38:04] <+Jekkfje> insane
[2023-01-07 18:38:24] <kr3du> he just plays only 3 power cards and boost them by 2 with cerebro, there is C2 C3 C4 up to C7 decks
[2023-01-07 18:38:41] <quantoll> That's not a spectrum KEKW
[2023-01-07 18:38:44] <quantoll> It's cerebro
[2023-01-07 18:38:45] <+Jekkfje> no
[2023-01-07 18:38:46] VIEWERS: 335
[2023-01-07 18:38:46] <%steeldeity06> no they can't play spectrum
[2023-01-07 18:39:03] <quantoll> They can't play anything more powerful than 3
[2023-01-07 18:39:11] <kr3du> thats pool 3 card
[2023-01-07 18:39:13] <%steeldeity06> the idea is to play cards that have the same power and buff everything with cerebro @spyro_za
[2023-01-07 18:39:18] <%shashank0034> why didnt game end
[2023-01-07 18:39:20] <%shashank0034> at turn 4
[2023-01-07 18:39:23] <@^StreamElements> Ever wanted your own unique gwent voice-line? If you are a sub, you can request your own card quote. !subs for more info
[2023-01-07 18:39:25] <+Jekkfje> cerebro 3 feels so odd with silver surfer now
[2023-01-07 18:39:33] <Ezras> @shashank0034 scarlet witch turned it after
[2023-01-07 18:39:37] <@%+xahverius> @steeldeity06 looked more scary than it was in the end
[2023-01-07 18:39:49] <DoomToWin> yes it dose
[2023-01-07 18:39:59] <Iwilljoy> yes, pretty hard
[2023-01-07 18:40:01] <%steeldeity06> it does. very good observation
[2023-01-07 18:40:04] <kr3du> yeah but they play with storm and/or scarlet sometimes to control the locations
[2023-01-07 18:40:06] <Ezras> @spyro_za Luke Cage denies that value now and makes scorpion useless now
[2023-01-07 18:40:18] <edenbeast1408> yes, many things ruin cerebros game plan, thats why its mostly a meme
[2023-01-07 18:40:18] <Ezras> even after he debuffs your hand
[2023-01-07 18:40:35] <edenbeast1408> but when it works it could be very strong

[2023-01-07 18:41:03] <%steeldeity06> @xahverius you need a lot of late p3 and one or two p4-5 cards to fully make cerebro decks work

[2023-01-07 18:41:18] <NoConcept_> KEKWait

[2023-01-07 18:42:41] <@^StreamElements> Thank you for following BearNecessitiesZ :)
[2023-01-07 18:42:43] <edenbeast1408> its pool 5 i believe
[2023-01-07 18:42:43] <quantoll> Synergies
[2023-01-07 18:42:45] <Ezras> @spyro_za viper can sene it back
[2023-01-07 18:42:45] <%steeldeity06> idea is to destroy that void or send it to their location with viper
[2023-01-07 18:42:46] VIEWERS: 335
[2023-01-07 18:42:47] <+Lastenchia> its good with viper
[2023-01-07 18:42:48] <+rotello1> you destroy that with carnage or send it with viper @Spyro_ZA
[2023-01-07 18:42:48] <Ezras> *send
[2023-01-07 18:42:52] <+Jekkfje> you can send that card to their side of the board
[2023-01-07 18:42:54] <Minus54> if you fill right, it doesn't show up, or if you have viper and pass it across
[2023-01-07 18:42:56] <DoomToWin> u can play it if u location is full as well
[2023-01-07 18:43:02] <DoomToWin> and u can send it or eat it
[2023-01-07 18:43:03] <+BearNecessitiesZ> @Spyro_ZA You can carnage it for no negative
[2023-01-07 18:43:08] <edenbeast1408> or you could eat/destroy the -8
[2023-01-07 18:43:12] <kr3du> viper sends ur cards at a location to opponent side
[2023-01-07 18:43:13] <wetboionacroissant> carnage, viper, or full location deals with -8
[2023-01-07 18:43:14] <%steeldeity06> it is shit lol. don't get us wrong
[2023-01-07 18:43:23] <wetboionacroissant> valkarye also
[2023-01-07 18:43:27] <%steeldeity06> but that's the general idea: to get rid of the void
[2023-01-07 18:43:30] <+rotello1> yeah still trash, but KEKL
[2023-01-07 18:43:38] <Iwilljoy> Many tools, also there is card nqmed Zero, which is disable cards ability
[2023-01-07 18:43:54] <edenbeast1408> or fill the right location before playing sentry,, it wont spawn the -8

[2023-01-07 18:51:53] <Ezras> also absorbing man off brood into surfer is disgusting
[2023-01-07 18:51:59] <%+xspectrum7> since golden nekker right? @XxJulio23

[2023-01-07 19:05:15] <+Jekkfje> it's cancer
[2023-01-07 19:05:32] <+amOblivious> the kang flavour is top tier
[2023-01-07 19:05:32] <%steeldeity06> @jekkfje that is not even the best play. the best play is Spiderman and absorbing man on turn 5 to completely lock out 2 locations for them on turn 6
[2023-01-07 19:05:59] <+Jekkfje> 90% of the player base doesn't have absorbing man
[2023-01-07 19:06:01] <+soarta> Carnaging into Cable so you could copy another Dino might've been worthwhile too. Lamentis games are just weird like that tbh
[2023-01-07 19:06:04] <+Jekkfje> irrelevant
[2023-01-07 19:06:30] <%steeldeity06> @jekkfje 90% is a stretch but yes majority. i was just talking about the better play
[2023-01-07 19:06:44] <Amighh> it is a bot no?

[2023-01-07 19:07:02] <%steeldeity06> this is a bot
[2023-01-07 19:07:12] <+Jekkfje> I could tell you about a million better plays with dark hawk and absorbing man and Galactus and knull but they don't apply to the average player

[2023-01-07 19:08:31] <Ezras> @jekkfje I got him the day the shop came out and for 2 months I wondered if he was a waste cause I never got much value out of him but with Zabu he is disgusting now
[2023-01-07 19:08:47] VIEWERS: 350
[2023-01-07 19:09:03] <+Jekkfje> yea absorbing man in general was a decent pick up just with zabu he's disgusting
[2023-01-07 19:09:07] <yous_ackman> What’s your nostalgia level for open beta gwent?
[2023-01-07 19:09:56] <%shashank0034> is this better than old dino
[2023-01-07 19:09:56] <Ezras> yea out of series 4 I'd say him and she hulk are the best the rest are meh

[2023-01-07 19:10:48] <%steeldeity06> @jekkfje i know about those plays. Galactus knull is definitely not better. it's very iffy. Spiderman abs man is currently meta along side darkhawk
[2023-01-07 19:10:48] <Ezras> yea it's a meme
[2023-01-07 19:11:01] <Ezras> not very reliable
[2023-01-07 19:11:10] <%steeldeity06> it's on the meme side. when it works tho it seriously feels good
[2023-01-07 19:11:11] <@theKeYeR> its quite good in some decks but normaly you run vision instead
[2023-01-07 19:11:16] <yous_ackman> Do you want to try the client Freddybabes provided?
[2023-01-07 19:11:19] <Ezras> it also can't beat Dracula
[2023-01-07 19:11:24] <Amighh> Captain marvel is a good counter to Leader
[2023-01-07 19:11:38] <+Jekkfje> captain marvel is a good card copium
[2023-01-07 19:11:45] <+Jekkfje> but I love the artgem art
[2023-01-07 19:11:49] <+Jekkfje> so I run it anyway

[2023-01-07 19:21:43] <Ezras> @akai_kami he did
[2023-01-07 19:21:55] <%steeldeity06> black panther is like A tier. Just strong but not top
[2023-01-07 19:22:05] <Ezras> @dice__17 no he isn't unless it's with Zola or the million pt version
[2023-01-07 19:22:09] <%steeldeity06> he was tier 1 on release with on reveal decks
[2023-01-07 19:22:14] <Akai_kami> how come not using any pool 3 cards?
[2023-01-07 19:22:18] <%steeldeity06> and now he is t1 with shuri decks
