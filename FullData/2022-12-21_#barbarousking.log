[2022-12-21 15:41:25] <abstract_octopus_> it is the best Madge
[2022-12-21 15:41:27] <%Rubizco> you want multihits, armor pierce, and AoE and status and a lot of synergy

[2022-12-21 15:54:50] <%$gamefunatic_prime> @StarfireShepardo why not buy it and try it. the entertainment comes from how good he is at the game. Dollars to donuts you can't beat it on the base difficulty let alone 32 heat.
[2022-12-21 15:54:50] <hallow1880> Its sad to me just how much Diablo dropped the ball for other games of the genre to take it up and run with it
[2022-12-21 15:54:58] <%FlowersForAlgorithm> seems like the Mario crowd is really working against their own self-interest
[2022-12-21 15:54:58] <%$TWCblank> @drkirienko I think what makes this person stupid is that barb asked them what their favorite games are and they said "I don't know"

[2022-12-21 16:07:20] <%StarfireShepardo> You play what you like to play, It just looks to me that way as i said.
[2022-12-21 16:07:20] <%thejumpingmouse> This game is amazing, it defiantly helps watch enjoyment if you've played the game. You know the boons and can tell what's going on a bit better if you have experience playing it.
[2022-12-21 16:07:21] <%rocketgruntdru> nah you don't owe us any explanation duder
[2022-12-21 16:07:24] <%+MrDisagree> this is your world, we're just living in it
[2022-12-21 16:07:26] <%GnastyGnork_> But WHY though? Madge
[2022-12-21 16:07:28] <%y2zipper> Sifu is incredible.

[2022-12-21 16:07:29] <%+twistedfred87> Barb now mains Hades out of spite KEKW
[2022-12-21 16:07:29] <%DonkeyMintInc> I don’t think I’ve ever wondered why you’re playing Hades
[2022-12-21 16:07:30] <%+MentallyInept> Some sort of survival mode IIRC
[2022-12-21 16:07:30] <Mush23> pvp? OhMyDog
[2022-12-21 16:07:30] <%CrossFortune> oh shit really?
[2022-12-21 16:07:30] <%MobyDew> SIF OOOO
[2022-12-21 16:07:30] <%sththunder> Loved sifu
[2022-12-21 16:07:32] <%Bloody_Raw> i think PvP is the worst addition to any game. it just means the Devs couldnt make enough content so fight eachother
[2022-12-21 16:07:37] <%littlebirdytoldme> I hate having to stay in a stream where the streamer is playing what I’m not interested in…oh wait, I don’t!
[2022-12-21 16:07:37] <%wolftickets88> Sifu was sick
[2022-12-21 16:07:37] <%+Triple_Zed> I dunno, yump gets explained a lot
[2022-12-21 16:07:37] <+enhoshen> have barb beaten 45 heat
[2022-12-21 16:07:37] <ToasterSteak> I think it’s really transparent when streamers are just chasing the popular game vs something they enjoy playing.
[2022-12-21 16:07:37] <shina69> we need sifu on steam
[2022-12-21 16:07:37] <%+Krymzon19> I guess its the burden of becoming a variety streamer
[2022-12-21 16:07:38] <%$Dingusamingus> After some days of SMW I ask why you're playing SMW KEKW

[2022-12-21 16:07:41] <%RageTWD> been a hot minute since I've seen sifu
[2022-12-21 16:07:42] <%JHammon67> But why male models?
[2022-12-21 16:07:42] <%DoctorBlowfly> coming to steam in march
[2022-12-21 16:07:43] <%y2zipper> like a kung Fu movie as a game.
[2022-12-21 16:07:44] <%+TheHundaddy> why pway Madge
[2022-12-21 16:07:44] <%+megmoo4u> love sifu. great game
[2022-12-21 16:07:52] <%+IdolizeDT> @Bloody_Raw that's a bit reductive, a lot of people WANT PvP
[2022-12-21 16:07:53] <%chickeneer> I legit just don't watch streamers when they are playing something I don't like. Crazy concept.
[2022-12-21 16:07:53] <%+Sorry4HavingFun> Its the Content Creator's curse, you ignore all the positive comments and hyperfocus on the negative ones.
[2022-12-21 16:07:54] <%90PercentLettuce> does Sifu scratch the Sekiro itch at all? been hunting for a game that gives em similiar feelings
[2022-12-21 16:07:54] <%$ChicCanyon> challenge arenas and new moves
[2022-12-21 16:07:55] <%+TheHundaddy> i can't wait fr more sifu

[2022-12-21 16:08:02] <%$anonsama9001> does barb enjoy chess?
[2022-12-21 16:08:02] <%$EternalHav0c> I love the shield
[2022-12-21 16:08:05] <%+Triple_Zed> and regrab
[2022-12-21 16:08:06] <%$Dingusamingus> I wanna say 45, I think shield was your PB before gun
[2022-12-21 16:08:10] <palmturner> the acid always fucks me up here
[2022-12-21 16:08:10] <%+ech0cide> @littlebirdytoldme i stay here because barb is awesome, even though I don't really like Hades much
[2022-12-21 16:08:10] <@%$DanTheVP> @Bloody_Raw I think that is a very ignorant view, PVP is literally one of the hardest things to balances and get right for Devs
[2022-12-21 16:08:13] <%Ekin0x> People not aware of the ungodly amount of Hades 2 coming our way KEKW
[2022-12-21 16:08:13] <%wolftickets88> I think chaos shield is maybe the best weapon in the game
[2022-12-21 16:08:15] <%DoctorBlowfly> I hope sifu runs well on the steam deck
[2022-12-21 16:08:16] <dye_clc> thats why i never gonna stream again. imagine me going back and forth to anthem. i love the game. i can imagine chat
[2022-12-21 16:08:18] <%y2zipper> I'm stuck on museum boss there...
[2022-12-21 16:08:18] <unsavedprogresswillbelost> barb, no offense but that one guy in chat really ruined your day? sheesh...
[2022-12-21 16:08:18] <%$ChicCanyon> @90percentlettuce not at all
[2022-12-21 16:08:33] <%90PercentLettuce> @ChicCanyon dang. well that's a bummer.

[2022-12-21 16:08:33] <%Cataphract116> Poison is the worst mechanic in this game
[2022-12-21 16:08:36] <%flavvless1> rats have too much HP imo...so fuckin annoying

[2022-12-21 16:08:47] <%+Lord_Suiadan> Those big rats hit fucking hard
[2022-12-21 16:08:48] <%+AnimusAja> @Bloody_Raw This 100% true. Look at WoW. It's been around forever, and PvP there still sucks and is an unbalanced mess.
[2022-12-21 16:08:48] <%$Applin_L> for me thats playing around 16-20 heat for fun... 45 looks INSANE
[2022-12-21 16:08:49] <%$freya_thuriaaz> EZ
[2022-12-21 16:08:51] <%$Dingusamingus> @Bloody_Raw Especially if PVP ties into PvE at all. Then you have to balance around both NotLikeThis
[2022-12-21 16:08:53] <%+RolloDaViking> @Ekin0x Pretty sure it will be very Godly
[2022-12-21 16:08:54] <%FrsMns> I hate this arena. Once the rats start shitting there's NO place to stand

[2022-12-21 16:09:25] <%+AwakenSmok3> @StarfireShepardo The game can be a bit jarring if your only experience in watching it is at such a high level as this. So much going on that you really just can't understand what's going on.
[2022-12-21 16:09:26] <%Electrolith> @jigantor33 All my least favorite rooms start with saw blade traps. WutFace

[2022-12-21 16:09:37] <$BiosageX> If you run out of time, does it use a death defy and give you a little more time? or is it a full murder?

[2022-12-21 16:09:59] <%thejumpingmouse> @BiosageX It damages you every second. So you can go over quite a bit with full health and death defies

[2022-12-21 16:17:47] <%MrSpaghettiZone> Hades is called "Redacted" for lore reasons

[2022-12-21 16:18:04] <%$pythonLB> not enough tbh
[2022-12-21 16:18:04] <%Electrolith> They just redact Hades’ name. He’s not supposed to be on the surface murdering his son.

[2022-12-21 16:18:04] <%bizangles> I tried a fresh file some time ago and got it in 11

[2022-12-21 16:18:13] <%FlowersForAlgorithm> @swedechick in the fiction of the game Hades doesn't like it known that he has to fight his son to keep from escaping so the records lists Hades as "redacted"

[2022-12-21 17:49:51] <%$Scoutyx> tim jim and bim
[2022-12-21 17:49:53] <%+Standard_Deviation_> if you remove the game testers and special thanks theres like 5 people
[2022-12-21 17:49:54] <%$IsntEvenMyFinalForm> Mike, Mike and Mike
[2022-12-21 17:49:54] <+mcrage12> playtesters are different
[2022-12-21 17:49:55] <%Topgun486> I'm curious were they take elden ring. I'm hoping they follow miquellas story.
[2022-12-21 17:49:58] <%gitwithit> its kevin not jim
[2022-12-21 17:49:58] <%zal0k> does a marketing team count, though? Kappa
[2022-12-21 17:49:58] <%$anaanook> Hollow knight primarily was 3 people
[2022-12-21 17:49:58] <%+GiraffeKiller> Ari, William and Jack, looks like.
[2022-12-21 17:49:58] <%dream_the_cast> they hired outside playtesters and stuff
[2022-12-21 17:49:58] <%RoccoLetsPoop> what rules
[2022-12-21 17:50:01] <%+AdamSabre> Wow, no checkpoint?
[2022-12-21 17:50:02] <%$Cj_Version1> maybe 7
[2022-12-21 17:50:02] <%+royalruraljuror> it's three people the same way that GPW2 was made by one person
[2022-12-21 17:50:06] <%titzzzz93> so, I guess EA is taking over for Sekiro 2
[2022-12-21 17:50:06] <%$izombie387> credits will have thousands probably
[2022-12-21 17:50:08] <Kraelan> Hollownight main game has many more people, but all the assets they needed for Silksong were already made, so far fewer are needed.

[2022-12-21 17:50:18] <PixlBitNick> Team Cherry is based in Adelaide, South Australia. Hollow Knight is the team’s only finished product, but it turned Team Cherry into an indie development darling nearly overnight. Outside of the listed three, Team Cherry also employed or contracted dozens of people for Hollow Knight. The positions include technical directors, environment designers. beta testers, musicians, and more. The same is likely true for Silksong.

[2022-12-21 17:50:37] <zzestyy1> they def have contractors
[2022-12-21 17:50:37] <%+Standard_Deviation_> The problem is that the game would not be as good without all those extra people (play testers and others)

[2022-12-21 17:50:46] <%$TWCblank> ok, so the TEAM is made of 3 people, but more than 3 people are working on it.
[2022-12-21 17:50:48] <%+Leo_Fara> Well Outer Wilds is like 8 people or something and is huge
[2022-12-21 17:50:55] <%+pinkpuffles> The credits back it up
[2022-12-21 17:50:55] <%bizangles> It's 3 people. 2 co-directors and a coder. That poor coder with 2 bosses
[2022-12-21 17:50:55] <%JasperWho> 2 devs, a technical director and christopher larkin for music. the rest are a handful of contractors, game testers and special thanks
[2022-12-21 17:50:55] <%$Anthuulos> that's just indie development
[2022-12-21 17:50:55] <+veddy0> they want all the credit :(
[2022-12-21 17:50:58] <%+CakeBearer> Its built on Unity yeah?
[2022-12-21 17:50:58] <%$anaanook> nearly everything except playtesters/marketing etc

[2022-12-21 17:51:03] <%$pythonLB> the game isnt made by 3 people, but the company has 3 employees
[2022-12-21 17:51:07] <%+Almemon> isn't supergiant also very small studio?

[2022-12-21 17:51:13] <%Mugzippit> hollow knight included a few dozen people but the bulk of it was done by the 3 people
[2022-12-21 17:51:13] <MathMath343> amazing games are made by incredibly small teams, like Tunic too
[2022-12-21 17:51:14] <%+mav87333> Chained Echoes was made by one person and another made the music and it's one of the most lauded RPGs of the end of the year @barbarousking
[2022-12-21 17:51:14] <%Daramane_> it's wild but true
[2022-12-21 17:51:15] <%+BarlesCharkleyX> instantly 4 different names in the Hollow Knight credits lol
[2022-12-21 17:51:17] <@%$DanTheVP> Hot Take: but they should hire more people and actually finish the game
[2022-12-21 17:51:18] <%FlowersForAlgorithm> THOSE ARE PEOPLE!!!!!!!!!!!!
[2022-12-21 17:51:19] <%+odym82> 4 devs who also said “we brought in friends when we could”

[2022-12-21 17:51:24] <medictbh> they tested hollow knight with savestates tho so :/
[2022-12-21 17:51:24] <%$sournewt> Just Google the composer for Silksong and he’s not listed in the team, so it’s not just 3 people working on the game. Maybe 3 people are the main devs
[2022-12-21 17:51:25] <%+TotoQuebec> They really don't want to upscale and split the profit heh
[2022-12-21 17:51:27] <marlowe3> the dev team is 3 people, there's probably publisher support for porting, playtesting etc. but actual dev team is 3 people

[2022-12-21 17:51:35] <%$razovega> they should give credits to the other workers

[2022-12-21 17:51:54] <%titzzzz93> Barb did you hear the EA is taking over production of Sekiro 2?
[2022-12-21 17:51:54] <timAter> they're not gonna publish their other workers because weird nerds will harass them "whar silksong"
[2022-12-21 17:51:54] <%$KiD_ViD> that's the tradeoff... but the combat is so immaculate
[2022-12-21 17:51:56] <%+BougiePower> FlowersForAlgorithm It's my non person money and I want it now!

[2022-12-21 17:51:58] <%DickZippem> The core game developed by 3 people, another for music, and another for marketing. They had tons of contractors for programming tools, voice actors, etc.
[2022-12-21 17:52:01] <%$Blastphemy1290> 1 way to play Sekiro, refund it.

[2022-12-21 17:52:12] <%$The5oClockShadow> Sekiro multiple playthroughs are more challenge runs than different playstyles
[2022-12-21 17:52:12] <%rawsp33d> I heard GPW 2 was made by only 3 people
[2022-12-21 17:52:12] <%+ThisIsHalloweenOnRepeat> If only 3 people made Hollow Knight, only 1 person made GPW2
[2022-12-21 17:52:15] <%+solidpeyo> still Sekiro is better
[2022-12-21 17:52:16] <%$Lance_J> sekiro is only his favorite fromsoft game because he's never played metal wolf chaos

[2022-12-21 17:52:20] <MathMath343> yep sekiro = masterpiece
[2022-12-21 17:52:21] <$therealJedhigh> have you tried using the bow?
[2022-12-21 17:52:24] <%vesipera> My problem with Sekiro is that after it other fromsoft games feel slow and clunky
[2022-12-21 17:52:28] <%$MiniMausespeck> i just got the plat in sekiro and i love and hate it now
[2022-12-21 17:52:30] <%+PoshVolger> My favourite will also always be Bloodborne, even though I play Elden Ring more
[2022-12-21 17:52:41] <%$Xayren> Man there is a bunch of really dumb takes on this idea that Hollow Knight was made by a team of 3 or not.
[2022-12-21 17:52:43] <%$The5oClockShadow> Sekiro makes you feel like you earn eery win
[2022-12-21 17:52:44] <%Babaganoush44> barb likes games copypasta incoming

[2022-12-21 17:52:53] <%+MustangDrvr> loves gameplay....also loves walking simulator
[2022-12-21 17:52:56] <Exotic_Potato_> I think because sekiro can only be played one way, the gameplay is way better balanced and more fun
[2022-12-21 17:52:58] <$therealJedhigh> barb, do you have any interest in that High on Life game?
[2022-12-21 17:52:59] <%waywardfrantz> sekiro and doom eternal have such good gameplay that it's hard to play other games

[2022-12-21 17:53:17] <%imisgrunbula> i can't get into nioh at all
[2022-12-21 17:53:20] <%+seedmole> nioh 1 was tough to learn, but then nioh 2 was a blast after that
[2022-12-21 17:53:21] <%higHChloride> borb do you go to SMWCentral and search up "Munchers"
[2022-12-21 17:53:21] <@%$DanTheVP> Fans talk about Hollow Knight being made by 3 people as it it makes the game better. Impressive as it may be
[2022-12-21 17:53:22] <%CancerousGrowth> you didn't like it the 1st time arounddd

[2022-12-21 17:54:28] <Audiocrow> how much do you have to grind in Nioh 2?
[2022-12-21 17:54:29] <skepticaljesus> what is mario's hat? is this vanilla or does he have an ability?
[2022-12-21 17:54:32] <Sax_Therapy> Been playing Nioh 2 myself, it's just better in almost every way than 1. Great game
[2022-12-21 17:54:33] <snivyx33> people do really love ds1
[2022-12-21 17:54:34] <%+seedmole> yeah in nioh 2 you get the Penance Stone mechanic instead, so you can ramp it up if you want but it's not always so stupid
[2022-12-21 17:54:34] <%+stoveboy22> I went out on a date with a girl and she said her favorite game was DS2 and I laughed thinking it was a joke but she was dead serious and thought it was the best souls game

[2022-12-21 18:16:10] <mmmmsugar> The issue is that games are getting more and more complicated to make and there is no financial incentive to maintain them but due to their complexity you would need a team to patch them properly. And so hobbyists won’t be able to independently keep up and fix them properly either
[2022-12-21 18:16:10] <%CeeJac> is it really piracy if you buy the broken version on steam and then download a working version elsewhere?
[2022-12-21 18:16:13] <%$Headhuntern1> You can get it to launch by editing the settings in notepad to force windowed mode

[2022-12-21 18:22:52] <bluefaintingpig> yea too bad they decided to make sequels to the bible instead of the matrix
[2022-12-21 18:22:53] <zzestyy1> still better than 2 and 3

[2022-12-21 18:23:33] <NTheo> but then they need to do real work and design something
[2022-12-21 18:23:33] <%CeeJac> but the Terminator being unkillable is kinda his thing

[2022-12-21 19:02:31] <%MrAlexBoom> because of gamepass it probably is
[2022-12-21 19:02:32] <%bean_dip40> multiples less
[2022-12-21 19:02:32] <%saundsr> $250 for series s isn't bad
[2022-12-21 19:02:33] <%+breedwell> gamepass is fantastic
[2022-12-21 19:02:33] <stormbrewer55> Graphic cards are insanely expensive right now

[2022-12-21 19:02:34] <%$zeromegaman242> Way cheaper
[2022-12-21 19:02:36] <+TexasCoconut> For the specs its still a bit cheaper
[2022-12-21 19:02:36] <%$joejoejoe_joejoejoe> cross-save on xbox/pc is really nice, I can pick up a game in another room
[2022-12-21 19:02:36] <OneForths> still very true, video cards are still insane for PC
[2022-12-21 19:02:37] <%firecrotch007> Save up for a PC at that point
[2022-12-21 19:02:37] <%+agchee> Yes. PC's are still pricey if you want decent performance.

[2022-12-21 19:02:38] <%$archang3l_media> well... For my gaming PC, i spent this year 1500€ alone
[2022-12-21 19:02:38] <%SacraficialYoshi> quite a bit
[2022-12-21 19:02:40] <%$Night_river> My Xbox is my gamepass machine and I'm happy about that

[2022-12-21 19:02:42] <%$azrael_dr> It's quite cheaper because of NVidia

[2022-12-21 19:02:42] <%$freya_thuriaaz> you can use the game pass on PC though

[2022-12-21 19:02:43] <%Pumpanickle> Building a PC is outrageously expensive these days
[2022-12-21 19:02:44] <@%$DanTheVP> it is a lot cheaper
[2022-12-21 19:02:44] <%PastyWhite_> storage is still a problem on xbox
[2022-12-21 19:02:45] <%$twister9246> 220 € for the xbox series s is a good deal

[2022-12-21 19:02:50] <%imisgrunbula> i dont have time to play a shit load of games so game pass for me would be a waste
[2022-12-21 19:02:51] <%+comrade_lucifer> a GPU alone costs more than an xbox
[2022-12-21 19:02:52] <%DickZippem> Just don't be poor 4Head
[2022-12-21 19:02:53] <+Fatd33r> bye greenscreen Sadge
[2022-12-21 19:02:53] <%+breedwell> gamepass is better for Xbox than PlayStation for sure
[2022-12-21 19:02:59] <+TexasCoconut> A graphics card costs as mucha s an xbox these days
[2022-12-21 19:03:04] <stormbrewer55> PCs used to be better value pre crypto
[2022-12-21 19:03:04] <%$Definitely_Alive> By a big margin. 4K gameplay for $400 is less than a decent gfx card.
[2022-12-21 19:03:04] <%+ChaosZeroX> Xbox is useless. Its a game pass machine and its it and even then you could just build a decent PC rig and get gamepass anyway lol
[2022-12-21 19:03:07] <%+iGrowwearyofthisworld> no 300 dollar PC is doing what a Series S does at least, I like it for couch gaming with my dog
[2022-12-21 19:03:08] <%$azrael_dr> NVidia's GPUs have fucked the costs of pcs
[2022-12-21 19:03:09] <%$Blueberry_Scones> peepoVanish
[2022-12-21 19:03:10] <%+jasonpizzaburger> xbox is way cheaper than a modern gaming pc
[2022-12-21 19:03:13] <%Daramane_> hi legit just bought an Xbox for $200 because it was cheaper than buying a brand new computer for more
[2022-12-21 19:03:23] <%+TheGamingSwampcat> a used XBOX Series X near me is like...350.
[2022-12-21 19:03:23] <%Xintoxed> That's barbs blanky from when he was a kid. His parents knew he'd grow up to be a cave goblin.

[2022-12-21 19:03:33] <%Demagus3> the wendy's around the corner from me closed suddenly last month so now i don't have a convenient source of nuggies
[2022-12-21 19:03:36] <%toadflaxhc> i haven't needed to upgrade my pc for anything in at least 10 years. new games just don't make me want to spend that amount of $$
[2022-12-21 19:03:39] <%+johnbakedboy> for an equivalent performance xbox is gonna be cheaper than building a PC
[2022-12-21 19:03:40] <%DickZippem> My 3060ti was $450, which is almost as much as the series X on its own.
[2022-12-21 19:03:41] <%LemonStir> If you want something as powerful as a $250 Xbox Series S you're looking at $1000 for a PC at a minimum

[2022-12-21 19:04:08] <%+IdolizeDT> no but for real, FPS Boost on old xbone and 360 titles is SUPER cool, getting 60 or even 120 Hz on games that definitely never had that in mind, such as the gears games and the like. The list of supported games is quite nice.

[2022-12-21 19:04:17] <MeekMogwin> Xbox with Gamepass and then a Steam Deck is the perfect combo these days
[2022-12-21 19:04:23] <%$Blastphemy1290> @toadflaxhc 10yr old PC is pretty yikes. I built my own comp in 2012 and was lucky it lasted til 2020

[2022-12-21 19:04:50] <%$FengWeiWay> xbox selling better
[2022-12-21 19:04:51] <%+IdolizeDT> 28m ps5 vs 20m xbs
[2022-12-21 19:04:52] <%+johnbakedboy> @elpo91 can hook a pc up to a TV and bluetooth controller
[2022-12-21 19:04:57] <%+IdolizeDT> that just came out a few days ago
[2022-12-21 19:04:58] <TrapCat88> used for $350? You could buy a new one for that or series s
[2022-12-21 19:04:58] <%$archang3l_media> well, you CAN get an xbox... try that with a PS5
[2022-12-21 19:04:58] <%+solidpeyo> Xbox is at the bottom
[2022-12-21 19:05:01] <%imisgrunbula> @FengWeiWay you're tripping
[2022-12-21 19:05:03] <+Fatd33r> I think Xbox sells better as of right now because of console availability
[2022-12-21 19:05:05] <%$Blastphemy1290> @toadflaxhc unless you replaced the CPU, memory, and video csrd, it is def. very yikes
[2022-12-21 19:05:07] <%Crusher_Odinson> I think they re competing because xbox is more available
[2022-12-21 19:05:11] <%$Definitely_Alive> Xbox sold more because of better availability
[2022-12-21 19:05:12] <%+Matronix> Xbox is probably selling better because you can find them in stores.
[2022-12-21 19:05:12] <%firecrotch007> I’d rather know game pass numbers
[2022-12-21 19:05:18] <OctavianWolfbane> probably about the same, coz nobody buys xbox and nobody could get PS5.....KEKW
[2022-12-21 19:05:18] <%+Fail_Snail> who the hell is buying xboxes?

[2022-12-21 19:05:26] <$PatrickMJones> xbox people use it for netflix lol
[2022-12-21 19:05:28] <%Dante_Draco> Considering PS5 are made one at a time by blind monks on top of some mystic mountain it might be easier to get the XBOX.
[2022-12-21 19:05:28] <%+Dr1919> Still can't buy a ps5 easily
[2022-12-21 19:05:29] <%$FengWeiWay> no because you can't buy PS5
[2022-12-21 19:05:29] <MeekMogwin> Both are great machines but Series S is fantastic from a performance and affordability.
[2022-12-21 19:05:31] <%+tbomb3081> but the Activision deal is worth more than Sony
[2022-12-21 19:05:31] <%+Elpo91> @johnbakedboy true but I just don’t want a whole pc setup next to the tv in my living room
[2022-12-21 19:05:32] <%+jaquiil> probably cause you cant buy a ps5 atm
[2022-12-21 19:05:32] <%$freya_thuriaaz> PS5 had the supply issue going on, I wouldn't be surprised if they undersold
[2022-12-21 19:05:33] <%+johnbakedboy> the only reason xbox would have more sales would be due to stock and shortages
[2022-12-21 19:05:36] <%MrBushido0> @barbarousking, did you have doubts of what to do with your life? Like job, study, or even hobbies
[2022-12-21 19:05:36] <%saundsr> if it 28m vs 20m.. thats impressive for xbox since they've had halo and forza and thats it
[2022-12-21 19:05:36] <%$EdgeCloud777> wasnt xbox easier to get for awhile?
[2022-12-21 19:05:37] <%PastyWhite_> I work on my PC all day, I don't want to play games on it too. That's why I prefer consoles for gaming
[2022-12-21 19:05:38] <%Pumpanickle> Xbox is having a killer launch. Game Pass is a huge value
[2022-12-21 19:05:39] <%auri0ch> Xbox is cheaper and more available

[2022-12-21 19:05:44] <%+darkart800> @BarbarousKing pretty sure xbox only sells better because the PS5 is still hard to get
[2022-12-21 19:05:44] <%+solidpeyo> @octavianwolfbane PS5 are everywhere now
[2022-12-21 19:05:48] <%toadflaxhc> @Blastphemy1290 you're entitled to that opinion but i disagree. i keep it clean and it works more than fine
[2022-12-21 19:05:49] <%$pythonLB> ive been thinking about selling my ps5. literally nothing coming out that i care about for it, kinda feel like i got scammed
[2022-12-21 19:05:50] <%cloudhppr> game pass is very successful
[2022-12-21 19:05:50] <random5765> i bought a series s because it's cheaper
[2022-12-21 19:05:50] <+Clophen_> If they sold more it's because they had more stock
[2022-12-21 19:05:55] <%toxicpycnometer> it was during PS4 but it's weakening, less PS+ too
[2022-12-21 19:05:56] <%+BougiePower> IdolizeDT I wonder how much the numbers would be if PS5 didn't have availability restriction
[2022-12-21 19:05:57] <OctavianWolfbane> playstation is the only profitable dept in Sony
[2022-12-21 19:05:58] <%vstpnv> I heard that that new Xbox has finally set a new record on sales in Japan, it's still kinda low though
[2022-12-21 19:06:00] <%xdeepsx> 36 here, working, still have doubts

[2022-12-21 19:06:00] <stormbrewer55> Sony makes a lot compared to Xbox, but nintendos profit margin is nuts
[2022-12-21 19:06:01] <%+ANRSaan> Over the past 24 months, the PS5 has sold over 1 million more units in the US than the X-box
[2022-12-21 19:06:04] <threewisemen12> those are boring people
[2022-12-21 19:06:04] <nixonfitzpatrick> SONY tvs fell off, SONY movies are absolute garbage. PS5s are pretty damn good

[2022-12-21 19:06:06] <%RicoTheSaboteur> At some point it was the biggest division as far as profit goes, but it was far behind in size

[2022-12-21 19:57:05] <@%$deejay4am> @DJ_Sesame You're welcome! Yeah it can happen in small bits over time and before you know it you're 5, 10, 30 seconds behind. The idea is that if you buffer then you don't miss anything, rather than skipping a bunch of content when it happens (I guess!)
[2022-12-21 19:57:07] <%BenDoubleU> andor is like a tom clancy star wars series
[2022-12-21 19:57:08] <%$lansiar> best star wars since the og 3

[2022-12-21 19:57:28] <%+royalruraljuror> first two episodes had big problems, but it was great after that
[2022-12-21 19:57:30] <Dexthedog123> Andor takes itself as seriously as the characters do.
[2022-12-21 19:57:32] <%para_lll> Andor is really solid
[2022-12-21 19:57:33] <%DJ_Sesame> Andor shows how good these IPs can be with real writing
[2022-12-21 19:57:36] <%$CriticalBuzz> it was a great star wars story without lightsabers.  not a coincidence.
[2022-12-21 19:57:36] <%theBonestorm> It's not even good, just decent compared to all their other drivel
[2022-12-21 19:57:38] <%+thethorgot> i've already forgotten what happened to him

[2022-12-21 19:57:43] <%+topo_grande> hadnt watched any of the new star wars shows, but got disney plus to watch Andor based on your rec
[2022-12-21 19:57:47] <%$NightTrace> I like that Andor shows that you resist fascism through violence and Liberals don't quite grasp that still even though they enjoy it and understand that that's what is happening in the show :P
[2022-12-21 19:57:50] <%Cronny> it's an adult film?

[2022-12-21 19:58:13] <Screegar> Andor was good enough to tell me that the issue with Star Wars in general is Jedi storylines. Only OG trilogy has a decent Jedi story.

I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn’t want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything. He said, “Oh, like you’re doing now?” I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off.

[2022-12-21 20:10:51] <%drkirienko> @Nuke144 if by "Wendy's" you mean "Kaite", then yes
[2022-12-21 20:10:54] <threewisemen12> there is a coin leading to the top cheese. secret exit somewhere up there?
[2022-12-21 20:11:16] <%+OneWonderfulFish> Barb has one of those Amazon buttons but for Wendy's that automatically orders a 10 piece with ghost pepper ranch.
[2022-12-21 20:11:17] <ZylaxBeeple> do u think that yoshi gets embarrassed when he poos out eggs in front of mario??? sorry if this ofends anyone but i thought it was a funny thing haha. and i would like to know if any of you have any pics of yoshi pooping an egg while he looks nervous or embarrassed i just want to see it for a few laughs haha. another thing i am wondering is what do you think the eggs smell like haha im just curious for laughs haha i would like to smell them
