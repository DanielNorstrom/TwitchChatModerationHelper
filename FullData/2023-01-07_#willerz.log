[2023-01-07 16:06:22] <To_Toasty_4_U> which is just benadryl

[2023-01-07 18:13:10] <%xgon9> @WillerZ i usually sight the DVL to 100 and hit more shots. Is there any other gun you really need to do that with?

[2023-01-07 22:38:41] <+thedylann91> @Da_Dush I just dont think BSG has any incentive to stop cheating, bc these dudes that get caught keep buying copies of the game so its just continued income for them
[2023-01-07 22:38:42] <%+BodyPartSalsa> @thedylann91 I think they do, I've seen a lot of nakeds killing themselves in factory

[2023-01-07 22:39:41] <+thedylann91> @BodyPartSalsa I think a lot of who gets caught has to do with how extensive you're cheating, like aim bot and flying and shit. Dudes with radar can 2nd PC run it which is virtually undetectable

[2023-01-07 23:54:12] <%Can0fWhoopAss> Yeah SOLO, the guys youre playing with are nice, but the playstyle changes soo much.
[2023-01-07 23:54:16] <%mouazo> duo
[2023-01-07 23:54:16] <%+l0fer> But you have lots of solo interactions too

[2023-01-07 23:54:30] <%+nog00d4u> solo, but not upset about duo stuff
[2023-01-07 23:54:33] <!%pastpresentfuturemusic> it's fun to see you play with folks, because you spend a lot of time not later on in wipe
