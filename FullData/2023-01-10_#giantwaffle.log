[2023-01-10 16:39:59] <%+wonly> It‚Äôs weird because usually when I have dns issue on my network they don‚Äôt get any access not intermittent access
[2023-01-10 16:40:09] <tomey36> It‚Äôs not DNS lol
[2023-01-10 16:40:28] <Turbo703> NOT DNS indeed
[2023-01-10 16:40:35] <%$Tabakhase> @maccabeus playerdata was there at first... maybe nino wiped it, or the half-login-logout-again fucked it..

[2023-01-10 16:57:34] <Atrius> 19 is also bad. if they don't respond all should be *, if they don't respond sometimes, that's not good.
[2023-01-10 16:57:38] <gamabunt> 19 hops?

[2023-01-10 17:04:42] <Nooooe> why should a VPN work? it it not changing the route is it? it just makes a virtual route that makes it looks like you are in another place. VPN always makes it a little slower

[2023-01-10 17:05:13] <%$Tabakhase> @Nooooe ofc. it changes the route
[2023-01-10 17:05:13] <%GGoodGGuy> lol no
[2023-01-10 17:05:17] <+Mick_> they do
[2023-01-10 17:05:17] <maccabeus> it literally does
[2023-01-10 17:05:19] <+Fyrboxer4> @chaoskub than you bud, i have interest in these things but no knowledge and get lost listening sometimes lol
[2023-01-10 17:05:20] <@%ninopanda> @FuraiTHD i am not having any issues
[2023-01-10 17:05:23] <%0x4273> they do that guy doesnt know what hes talking about
[2023-01-10 17:05:26] <+HyperKitty_> they do
[2023-01-10 17:05:38] <%+thenaylander> They DO change your route
[2023-01-10 17:05:38] <%+Traverus98> not looking good
[2023-01-10 17:05:39] <+Cloppeh> VPNs change your route
[2023-01-10 17:05:41] <+orillion> @Nooooe you connect out to vpn then connect from there
[2023-01-10 17:05:41] <%$bar10dr> @Nooooe Depends, if you connect away from the faulty node. The VPN might have a different route from its node.
[2023-01-10 17:05:42] <Janzert> @Nooooe it does change the route, because it causes you to route to the vpn then the actual server
[2023-01-10 17:05:42] <john_from_it> you may try switching vpn server
[2023-01-10 17:05:45] <%Aivarm> theres is 2 types of vpn.-. routed and tunneled
[2023-01-10 17:05:46] <+Akunin_EQ> I test issues alot of times by pinging the target, pinging my router, and pinging the 3rd hop from the tracert.  all of them pinging at the same time can narrow down where the break is happenning.
[2023-01-10 17:05:46] <+Silver_Skeeter> most do. some cheap ones don't
[2023-01-10 17:05:47] <+automatikaonline> restart your IPS router. This in normal error here in Eu. VPN makes your network more slower
[2023-01-10 17:05:47] <deadgolfer> they change it
[2023-01-10 17:05:48] <Harmar> vpns will connect you dirrectly to a computer and it will be your new start point
[2023-01-10 17:05:48] <@%$Apparentthreat> @Giantwaffle your VPN can end up on the same ISP KEKW
[2023-01-10 17:05:50] <FinnYellowbelly> if your route to the VPN is the SAME as the route to the server, you will still have issues
[2023-01-10 17:05:50] <%+suicidebolt> It does change you go to the VPN first so you want an IP you don‚Äôt have loss to and then it goes to the IP you target
[2023-01-10 17:05:55] <officialhunterx> weird question can it be dying network adaptor
[2023-01-10 17:05:59] <geraldtgnome> Yep but it could be a node close to the datacentre that is lagging
[2023-01-10 17:06:02] <%$Jolle450> What's next step in this process?
[2023-01-10 17:06:07] <%Surge43> Get star link to fly over the broken node.
[2023-01-10 17:06:11] <Chilled_Voodoo> flip your breaker
[2023-01-10 17:06:11] <%RafaLorenzo> maybe just maybe its time to get starlink  waffleSTARE
[2023-01-10 17:06:13] <%RationalLies> but have you tried restarting your smart fridge? Keepo
[2023-01-10 17:06:15] <%GuardMoony> It's only towards the server you got bad connection or also to google or such?
[2023-01-10 17:06:15] <%atamala> do you have the same issue in SE factorio?
[2023-01-10 17:06:19] <%GGoodGGuy> blame Ci
[2023-01-10 17:06:21] <WhatWhattington> a vpn that's close to the server you are connecting to might change your route, but a vpn to location that's not the shortest path might avoid a network routing issue
[2023-01-10 17:06:21] <%$Tabakhase> "access VPN" as in "connect to your office with lan-ip" is not what anyone is talkign about when people talk about "using a VPN" tbh...

[2023-01-10 17:06:23] <FinnYellowbelly> if they used a different peer, yes
[2023-01-10 17:06:28] <FuraiTHD> Nah, depends on how your traffic was routed.
[2023-01-10 17:06:28] <Harmar> depends on how they have endpoint set up
[2023-01-10 17:06:28] <sktls_> could disable vpn to test
[2023-01-10 17:06:28] <+MrRiskyClick> @Giantwaffle vpns change your location by bouncing you to a diff node, but some vps will bounce you through a bunch of servers giving bad ping. wtffast uses thier servers to give shourtest route to reduce ping
[2023-01-10 17:06:28] <Version037> Waffle problems Kappa
[2023-01-10 17:06:33] <Swizzelz> turn off the VPN?

[2023-01-10 17:06:37] <deadgolfer> VPN to wherever NINO lives, his connection was fine

[2023-01-10 17:07:04] <%chaoskub> @Fyrboxer4 No worries, it's a good place for there. There are a lot of IT professionals in here. If you're interested in whats happening, google "dns for beginners" and take a look at some of the info there.
[2023-01-10 17:07:05] <%snoipa__> The Tuesday gods are against you unfortunately
[2023-01-10 17:07:05] <%+suicidebolt> So it is a larger BGP issue between two ISPs or Data Centers
[2023-01-10 17:07:08] <%+Traverus98> Have nino DM you where he lives and see if there's a vpn node near him

[2023-01-10 17:07:19] <+Akunin_EQ> It's not good to look at tracerts, those "drops" could just be a node set to not respond.

[2023-01-10 17:07:21] <FuraiTHD> Try different VPN edge, geolocated on the other side of the server.
[2023-01-10 17:07:22] <geraldtgnome> @Giantwaffle can you go to visual traceroute online and get ci to do it as well to see if there is a different route

[2023-01-10 17:08:26] <@%$Apparentthreat> but your VPN still has to use the same physical network as well like some are mentioning so it could still be a problem there

[2023-01-10 17:21:43] <+sorefingers> why do you have a stack limit on the secondary resource drawers? max upgrades + a void could make future ressource needs better
[2023-01-10 17:22:04] <%+Gh3ttoboy> @traverus98 all good then üòâ

[2023-01-10 17:23:49] <+sorefingers> its the secondary resources tho, you dont actively produce these
[2023-01-10 17:24:25] <+OhYesHumi> not voiding stuff, might bring you to situation where you need overpowered energy generation to coverup the needs of ALL machines (if it ever happens) when voiding at least there is no energy surprise x)

[2023-01-10 17:25:33] <+sorefingers> you need to void the secondary outputs anyway, might as well void at the maximum point possible would be my philosophy, bitches love resources haha
[2023-01-10 17:25:38] <%+Gh3ttoboy> 2048 items of each resource should also be fine

[2023-01-10 23:39:51] <%wakm> Aioli is mayo with garlic
[2023-01-10 23:39:55] <+TheRiehlDeal> Mayo is an emulsion of mayo and oil
[2023-01-10 23:40:02] <+DFron1> u mean fauxnaise
[2023-01-10 23:40:03] <DaFez_> Mayo uses oil too

[2023-01-10 23:40:11] <+PlayMavs> Mayo is egg and oil
[2023-01-10 23:40:11] <+DrBeardGuy> Both uses egg and oil, but aioli uses garlic
[2023-01-10 23:40:15] <IAmJester> gotta watch the aioli video by adam ragusea
[2023-01-10 23:40:16] <winulff> its just added garlic? afaik
[2023-01-10 23:40:18] <%Gay1e> I went and got fire fries from a gyro place. They're drizzled in garlic humus and and a tingly hotsauce, topped with tabuli
[2023-01-10 23:40:18] <%+TheGeekPeek> there is no actual difference. Aioli typically has garlic. They are fundamentally the same
[2023-01-10 23:40:32] <+caldex> NO, aLIOLI IS ONLZ OLIVE OIL AND GARLIC
[2023-01-10 23:40:32] <@%Kuroiorb> why does chat never look anything up? so loud and so wrong at the same time

[2023-01-10 23:40:50] <+caldex> sorrz for the caps
[2023-01-10 23:40:55] <Cinns_> The name is literally garlic (ai-all) and oil (oli)
[2023-01-10 23:40:56] <@%Kuroiorb> aioli is made from garlic and olive oil while mayo is made from egg yolks and canola oil
[2023-01-10 23:41:23] <+caldex> @TheGeekPeek there is a lot of difference
[2023-01-10 23:41:33] <+Koeckie> yeah thank you, I have no idea who is putting eggs in his aioli KEKW
