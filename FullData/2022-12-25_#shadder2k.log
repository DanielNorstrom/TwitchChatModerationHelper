[2022-12-25 18:53:58] <rocketslay_1> what is going on bruh
[2022-12-25 18:54:03] <+darkwarrior_> If other DPS were so much better then no one would be playing genji, genji pick rate is still VERY high, and his winrate is still very good
[2022-12-25 18:54:12] <switchbladessss> that orisa good with her cds
[2022-12-25 18:54:18] <brad_hawk_> woah
[2022-12-25 18:54:24] <%mixeryow> Genji is fun thats why people play him
[2022-12-25 18:54:41] <switchbladessss> yea genji really fun
[2022-12-25 18:54:50] <StoicBliss> Genji is difficult to play thats why I play the character GIGACHAD
[2022-12-25 18:54:51] <inquisitivejones> ^
[2022-12-25 18:54:53] <Dainter> give him back 30 ammo and hes 100% fine
[2022-12-25 18:55:02] <Dainter> in my tank opinion though
[2022-12-25 18:55:03] <inquisitivejones> legit there is no other reason for his high pickrate, he's Genji
