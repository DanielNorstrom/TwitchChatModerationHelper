[2022-12-29 14:50:19] <Calamity_Kyle> here's a fun one: do you know the (likely) original pronunciation of "knight"?
[2022-12-29 14:50:20] <!%RezaDarkside> kiriGreed
[2022-12-29 14:51:32] <+xenoside2003> Wasn't it Knicht or something, with the "K" pronounced.
[2022-12-29 14:51:37] <%Jadekaiser> @Calamity_Kyle is it knicht?
[2022-12-29 14:51:42] <Calamity_Kyle> in middle english, more or less everything was pronounced the way it was spelled, or spelled the way it was pronounced. so it was highly irregular. It looks like gibberish, but sounding it out sounds more or less like english. So "knight" was something to the effect of "kuh-nee-cht"
[2022-12-29 14:51:57] VIEWERS: 357
[2022-12-29 14:52:53] <Calamity_Kyle> I had a passionate linguist professor teaching us about Robin Hood (middle english stuff) in college. Learned some cool things.
[2022-12-29 14:53:50] <%Brynjarbjorn> Icelandic completely lacks an equivalent to "knight" but uses instead "riddari" - most likely from Ritter.
[2022-12-29 14:53:57] VIEWERS: 357
[2022-12-29 14:54:01] <+xenoside2003> Modern English is what happens when Norman soldiers try to seduce Saxon barmaids.
[2022-12-29 14:54:18] <%Brynjarbjorn> Possibly since there wasn't much of a nobility or a "knighthood" around here.
[2022-12-29 14:54:59] <Calamity_Kyle> Another fun bit from the middle english times: the original Robin Hood stories depict the character is enormously violent and at times, sadistic. The "steal from the rich" thing is barely a footnote, but it survived the ages.

[2022-12-29 15:18:46] <%Mindkeep> I originally found you streaming Rimworld/Biotech, but you always have such a calming voice first thing in the morning (7a in Colorado) no matter what you're playing.
[2022-12-29 15:18:58] <%Mindkeep> much different vibe with this game. lol
[2022-12-29 15:19:07] <laughingbear> I heard strawberry jam...so I woke up and joined the stream. :)
[2022-12-29 15:19:11] <Wit_R> wait there is mint in strawberry jam ? or is it a game thing ?
[2022-12-29 15:19:14] <Calamity_Kyle> Right? Kiri has a fantastic voice.
[2022-12-29 15:19:21] <%Mindkeep> ah, that too

[2022-12-29 15:20:32] <!%RezaDarkside> chunky mint too
[2022-12-29 15:20:43] <$FrothyDV> I wish I could get into DF more.   I tend to like Rimworld's small intimate population.  (And even like it more in the early stages when there are less colonists).   DF feels less personal - but I'm not sure I've given it a fair shake yet.
[2022-12-29 15:20:51] <laughingbear> I'm kinda stuck on the honeycomb. Honey, I get but honeycomb....not so much.
[2022-12-29 15:20:56] <%+dukearioch85> Thank you for the stream kiri, seems we have more people that want kiri narrated audiobooks, lol
[2022-12-29 15:21:11] <Calamity_Kyle> @laughingbear honeycomb is a texture thing imo. It's wonderful.

[2022-12-29 15:30:12] <Calamity_Kyle> @CubieDev cat bites have some sort of unique property to them that is practically venomous. It's ludicrously painful and requires the hospital.
[2022-12-29 15:30:36] <Calamity_Kyle> deep bites that is
[2022-12-29 15:30:37] <CubieDev> Really? damn

[2022-12-29 15:31:00] <Zyndr_> but I do play and dm D&D
[2022-12-29 15:31:02] <Calamity_Kyle> I think it's something in the saliva? But I cant remember for certain. My dad worked the E.R. and cat bites were a specific thing for treatment.
[2022-12-29 15:31:14] <!%RezaDarkside> you've had good dog experiences once or twice tho Kiri?

[2022-12-29 15:32:07] <%Gornser> @Calamity_Kyle it's that they are venomous but that their teeth are so sharp and thin, that they'll get you an infection because you can't clean those wounds

[2022-12-29 15:35:23] <!%RezaDarkside> @RezaDarkside you need the owner to train them properly, get them used to kids and getting their teth cleaned. no cat owner does that
[2022-12-29 15:35:54] <%Canslli> I know nobody wants to read this, but my dad (a doctor) have to stitch up kids who were bit by a dog on a weekly basis.....dogs are great, but they can be unpredictable

[2022-12-29 15:36:08] <Calamity_Kyle> @RezaDarkside seriously. Growing up with cats... I got plenty of (thankfully small) bites. So. Many. That cat was a jerk and a half.

[2022-12-29 15:36:47] <Calamity_Kyle> Would literally walk up to me, nuzzle me for a moment, then decide he hated me and bite me even though I hadn't even moved.
[2022-12-29 15:36:54] <!%RezaDarkside> @Canslli that is true, pet owners of all types should be lisenced and have some training in my opinion
[2022-12-29 15:37:44] <Calamity_Kyle> Pets need to be trained. Not training a pet that is capable of hurting someone is extreme negligence.

[2022-12-29 15:42:16] <%arrioch_> Yup, that's bad. I don't have a muzzle, but my doggo is almost always on a leash, i let him go only in parks where there are not a lot of people, and i'm always with him
[2022-12-29 15:42:18] <Calamity_Kyle> I love when (friendly) dogs jump up to me, but yeah, you need to train your pet to behave if you're going to take them around other people
[2022-12-29 15:42:32] <%+GwydionTTV> outside leash is mandatory in my place for that reason...
