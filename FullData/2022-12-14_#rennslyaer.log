[2022-12-14 11:27:33] <%$DeliberateConfusion> Also, it's a bit reductive to just label civilizations as good or evil in the context of the 40k universe. If you accept the premise that morality has some connection to reality and the laws of the universe, then what is moral in the context of 40k and what is moral in the context of the real world are vastly diffferent.

[2022-12-14 11:27:44] <%mikks_wav> @DeliberateConfusion the point is that its reductive

[2022-12-14 11:30:22] <%mikks_wav> but yeah people seem to have forgotten that the empire of man would be the evil imperial forces in basically any other setting and the specific nuance of 40k is that they aren't portrayed that way, only because the setting is so hilariously bleak
[2022-12-14 11:30:31] <%mikks_wav> it is part of the social and political satire of the world

[2022-12-14 11:32:11] <%mikks_wav> @mikks_wav you'd think people'd glean onto that based on the number of references to literally sauron, orcus, and other such "great evils" in media and mythology, but

[2022-12-14 11:36:08] <%mikks_wav> it was a little weird that they were playable because in-universe for fantrasy they are Big Deals but tbh all the Elf classes were a little uhhhh

[2022-12-14 11:59:36] <+ArsonBoy5996> I do love that every cutscene in the story is just each of the crew telling your PC to get bent in some way
[2022-12-14 11:59:52] <Wall_Lock> CUBE
[2022-12-14 12:00:12] <Valteine> Arson the cutscenes are even better as an Ogryn. Always crouched down jus to be eye level
