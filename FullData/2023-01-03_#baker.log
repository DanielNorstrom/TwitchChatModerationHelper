[2023-01-03 17:07:00] <%+ibkstorm> the ones that are interractable say "moved since" something
[2023-01-03 17:08:03] <%+ibkstorm> check the map. do the left top circle and some are in the middle line down. that adds up to 15
[2023-01-03 17:08:23] <%+ibkstorm> you can skip the starting part

[2023-01-03 17:46:02] <%+DennySommer> not worth your time
[2023-01-03 17:46:04] <%+Hi_Im_JJ> @strengthie No, it's my day off Smadge
[2023-01-03 17:46:07] <%Kwadrat_> depends
[2023-01-03 17:46:08] <MRxVIKO> I say the truth
[2023-01-03 17:46:13] <MRxVIKO> it is grindy
[2023-01-03 17:46:14] <%+UnzipsRS> i save them and say dont do it
[2023-01-03 17:46:16] <%+DennySommer> Its the ture
[2023-01-03 17:46:23] <MarkoLee78> for me the game is giga fun tbh, but Im just starting out.
[2023-01-03 17:46:24] <+klone_iron_fist> I think the game is worth a playthrough for sure, and then it depends if someone likes the end game cycle of chores or not.
[2023-01-03 17:46:28] <%Kwadrat_> if i know he is hardocre like me sure why not
[2023-01-03 17:46:28] <@%^Streamlabs> because it's the best.
[2023-01-03 17:46:33] <%Kwadrat_> but for casual play? hell no
[2023-01-03 17:46:35] <%polig> ok if the friend is fine with getting carried and i can carry him on content i would say go ahead
[2023-01-03 17:46:37] <%Grizzlybooey> NOPERS never have
[2023-01-03 17:46:43] <%SyzzAMV> my friend actual likes the game a lot but refuses to do chaos/guardians so won't play XD
[2023-01-03 17:46:50] <%+Hi_Im_JJ> I say "the game is a lot of fun but takes a lot of time" so people have the correct expectations going in YEP
[2023-01-03 17:46:51] <@%strengthie> Telling a friend to play LA now is like telling a friend to pick up League or Dota. We don't do that to friends.
[2023-01-03 17:46:54] <%+TrickmasteH> Its not always on weekend @Baker the guilds can control it, and my friends is on fridays
[2023-01-03 17:46:57] <%AncientCapitals> i tell them you can play this game , but you need to invest 200-300usd first cause otherwise you wont have a even close shot at catching up
[2023-01-03 17:46:58] <%polig> but if friend wants to grind things out themself id say no
[2023-01-03 17:47:01] <%+TrickmasteH> yep
[2023-01-03 17:47:04] VIEWERS: 562
[2023-01-03 17:47:08] <%+TrickmasteH> so you have to watch the schedule
[2023-01-03 17:47:16] <%+TrickmasteH> sometimes they do that too and fuck eachother for sure
[2023-01-03 17:47:30] <%Nikodermos> stop pitching the game as something to catch up to
[2023-01-03 17:47:33] <%polig> @AncientCapitals that wont give u a chance to catch up either might as well not waste it xD
[2023-01-03 17:47:38] <MRxVIKO> i think euc is more fun than other servers, Imagine starting as a new player in SA
[2023-01-03 17:47:43] <%Nikodermos> just have ppl enjoy their time playing the game
[2023-01-03 17:47:53] <%polig> unless you spend 200-300 in g2a you can somewhat catch up xD
[2023-01-03 17:47:57] <%AncientCapitals> @polig it will, it will get you easy to 4x3 1460 if you know what you are doing
[2023-01-03 17:48:00] <%Nikodermos> there isnt a actual rush to achieve anything

[2023-01-03 17:48:25] <%polig> @AncientCapitals what catch up is that? catch up to peoples sht alts?
[2023-01-03 17:48:29] <%SyzzAMV> it's not about "catching up" necessarily in this context - it is about being able to even play with your friend reasonably ICANT
[2023-01-03 17:48:54] <@%strengthie> Baker, You could do an undercover "New player" in NAE
[2023-01-03 17:48:58] <%+TrickmasteH> If a player starts today, and compares themself to anyone that started 1 year ago, they have to understand that the gains in this game are so slow and progressive. Its nearly impossible to be on the same playing ground, but that can be comparable to anything in life. Recommeding the game comes with a grain of salt, yes this is good, this is good, but heres where you will suffer etc.
[2023-01-03 17:49:00] <%polig> they will need tier reset sooner or later simple as that
[2023-01-03 17:49:01] <%AncientCapitals> @polig it will get you to a point where you can start catching up, there is no point for a new player to go to 1490 brel instantly since the person doesnt know the basics of doing mechanics

[2023-01-03 17:50:51] <%+TrickmasteH> Lost Ark is realistic, since we are all a bunch of lost souls, wandering around in this game.
[2023-01-03 17:51:00] <+klone_iron_fist> @strengthie you like some horizontal sir? :)

[2023-01-03 17:51:31] <%polig> unsub
[2023-01-03 17:51:31] <%SyzzAMV> they legitimately have to reduce daily requirement (whether it is amount of alts or amount per alt) to keep up with progression or the game will die imho
[2023-01-03 17:51:33] <@%strengthie> @strengthie not really like but I did them on NA and EUC

[2023-01-03 17:52:06] <%+TrickmasteH> its trash
[2023-01-03 17:52:08] <%Kwadrat_> oh mentor program for sure should be a thing

[2023-01-03 17:52:39] <%polig> if they want to fix something they need tier reset simple as that, doing tier reset at current mismatched patches would mean death to west, situation is scuffed in many ways
[2023-01-03 17:52:49] <%Kwadrat_> id say if u queue as mentor you should not get rewards but not use up ur pots/nades

[2023-01-03 17:53:27] <%+DennySommer> ye
[2023-01-03 17:53:39] <NotGrenton> 2 guardian raids and 2 chaos is dumb but its a KR mmo and tedious content is content for them idk
[2023-01-03 17:53:42] <%polig> its your fault tbh, you have too many brel chars
[2023-01-03 17:53:43] <%AncientCapitals> i mean a catch up to around 1445 with a beginner card set thats in place over time. would be good cause right now i think we loose alot of ppl cause we cant get them in to the exciting content for weeks
[2023-01-03 17:53:43] <@%strengthie> Maybe has to do with King River stepping aside?
[2023-01-03 17:54:03] <%Kwadrat_> even with rested its a shit load of content weekly
[2023-01-03 17:54:03] <NotGrenton> @strengthie goldriver said he thinks 2x guardian and 2x chaos is good for the game though. so hes not perfect
[2023-01-03 17:54:03] <+klone_iron_fist> They also need to make the weekly dungeons random, and pair people at high level doing their weeklies with low levels doing the dungeon to get through the campaign. Not finding groups for dungeons is terrible
[2023-01-03 17:54:13] <%Nikodermos> 2 /3 lego's from today's daily login card packs , zinnervale and armen , defn take those
[2023-01-03 17:54:18] <@%strengthie> @strengthie hahahaha sooo trueee
[2023-01-03 17:54:48] <%+TrickmasteH> Sad part is, the game Revolves around the time we consume doing dailys = play time for lost ark, which bumps there numbers. Without Dailies what would we do just raids? You know how quickly you run out of raids if you only do raids? They want us to stay online, to play, but they need to create a different avenue to earn gold. Since Gold Gate Keeping early on for new players is literately the only thing holding them back, besides runes / skill points etc.
[2023-01-03 17:54:53] <%+DennySommer> no
[2023-01-03 17:54:56] <%AncientCapitals> i have no friends that play this game ^^

[2023-01-03 17:55:36] <@%strengthie> @klone_iron_fist Yeah like the FF14 ssetup
[2023-01-03 17:55:54] <%+DennySommer> too many raids
[2023-01-03 17:56:02] <%+UnzipsRS> doing THIS?
[2023-01-03 17:56:09] <NotGrenton> they need to lower the daily loop then the raids become less overwhelming
[2023-01-03 17:56:09] <%+UnzipsRS> ayo
[2023-01-03 17:56:12] <%+UnzipsRS> wheres my emote
[2023-01-03 17:56:17] <%+UnzipsRS> THESE?
[2023-01-03 17:56:24] <%AncientCapitals> @DennySommer not too many raids, too many chaos dungeons and guardians raids are the fun thing that you wanna play xP

[2023-01-03 17:56:40] <NotGrenton> you know how behind on dailies i had to go just to prog hellkiss. Just reduce the daily loop and let people do the content they want
[2023-01-03 17:56:41] <%Nikodermos> that just ppl being unrealistic about what raiding is suppose to be
[2023-01-03 17:56:42] <%+DennySommer> toom many jail raids
[2023-01-03 17:56:45] <NotGrenton> and tehn add more content that isnt daily raids
[2023-01-03 17:56:49] <%Nikodermos> its never suppose to be a 1 shot
[2023-01-03 17:56:54] <%+TrickmasteH> There is a toxic culture in this game, when people wipe. But at the end of the day we should just enjoy our time together as best as possilbe. But I feel that pressure during bussing for sure.
[2023-01-03 17:56:54] <%+Hi_Im_JJ> I gatekeep like a mother fucker so I get especially annoyed when people fuck up simple mechs, not gonna lie KEKW
[2023-01-03 17:57:06] VIEWERS: 574
[2023-01-03 17:57:29] <%polig> daily for sure something they could cut down on
[2023-01-03 17:57:36] <NotGrenton> EXACTLY make him like 50% stronger and drop 2x the rewards
[2023-01-03 17:57:55] <%+TrickmasteH> If they gave us the same mats for 1 clear, for 2 clears. (however, they would have to double the relic drops, and such) since its each kill = an rng gamble kill.
[2023-01-03 17:58:09] <+klone_iron_fist> and ANYTHING can drop in a map
[2023-01-03 17:58:13] <%+TrickmasteH> They just maximizing our play time lul

[2023-01-03 18:00:24] <%ikigami_ikigai> cool
[2023-01-03 18:00:25] <%+TrickmasteH> I think there are inherited ingame systems baker that are very hard to change with changing there numbers on how much people play the game, which has a big effect too.
[2023-01-03 18:00:26] <%+TrickmasteH> even tho i agree and want 1 of each
[2023-01-03 18:00:38] <%ikigami_ikigai> same SadCat hadn't have a good card in like 3 weeks
[2023-01-03 18:00:44] <%+TrickmasteH> yep
[2023-01-03 18:00:47] <%Nikodermos> the base of an rng dung farm, they last less than 5 mins, the whole fact we can run them ENDlessly , i dont get ppl being made the first 2 per day are full rewards
[2023-01-03 18:00:56] <%+TrickmasteH> they can change the system, for sure some how
[2023-01-03 18:01:00] <%+DennySommer> The thing is the west isnt KR if the value is shit or the system is shit people are jus going working around. Just look at the sold items sortet from highest price
[2023-01-03 18:01:06] <MRxVIKO> dailies became annoying for sure, but like i always say i only care about gold prices for items other stuff i dont mind as much
[2023-01-03 18:01:07] VIEWERS: 587
[2023-01-03 18:01:08] <%+TrickmasteH> more hp on guardian / more hp on chaos, double the rewards 2x (like doing 2 clears)
[2023-01-03 18:01:13] <%+TrickmasteH> so the time is similar
[2023-01-03 18:01:20] <%Nikodermos> id rather they make raids bi weekly than change dailies
[2023-01-03 18:01:36] <%+TrickmasteH> tru
[2023-01-03 18:01:53] <NotGrenton> @Nikodermos ?? You mean doing 12+ chaos dungeons and guardian raids a day is more fun than doing raids idk man i dont agree LUL
[2023-01-03 18:01:54] <%ikigami_ikigai> I got 8 I'll be around
[2023-01-03 18:02:00] <%+TrickmasteH> some people even hate raids niko at this point they are drained them them too
[2023-01-03 18:02:06] <%polig> what profit, our weekly grind is 20euros on g2a, just have fun first xD
[2023-01-03 18:02:36] <%+DennySommer> profit KEKW
[2023-01-03 18:02:39] <%+TrickmasteH> i think this is a long term game baker, and we just have to know how to pace our selfs for our own pace.
[2023-01-03 18:02:57] <%Grizzlybooey> Honnestly im doing the same, just doing raids, and havent really Grinded past 3 weeks

[2023-01-03 18:03:17] <%ikigami_ikigai> honestly 1 chaos less and unas becoming weekly instead of daily would fix a bit of burnout I believe
[2023-01-03 18:03:30] <%+TrickmasteH> The only thing i dislike about the game at the moment right now. Is Mokoko retention & there ability to grow there character and earn gold. Otherwise there is no future.

[2023-01-03 18:04:42] <%+TrickmasteH> thats the problem for them
[2023-01-03 18:04:53] <%+TrickmasteH> they should not have to whale to create a char
[2023-01-03 18:05:00] <%+TrickmasteH> for gold..

[2023-01-03 18:05:13] <%+DennySommer> What new players you cant even use AH as a new Player ???
[2023-01-03 18:05:21] <%+TrickmasteH> i cant imagine how long it would take a brand new player to make a 5x3 char 1490
[2023-01-03 18:05:22] <+klone_iron_fist> but that's the thing, everything is known in almost any raod you go in. Lost Ark's draw pure and simple is the gameplay. infinite classes that feel different that are balanced yet moves all feel impactful!
[2023-01-03 18:05:23] <%Nikodermos> the point of games is to have fun right, the game is a RPG for adventuring / dung crawleing/ and yes raiding is the end game of that genre, but to say that the x2 5-10 mins dungs for gear /mats etc is the biggest issue for burn out, i dont get it , play other games rather than change the base of what this game is
[2023-01-03 18:05:30] <MRxVIKO> u got 200k gold what can u buy with that, almost nothing
[2023-01-03 18:05:51] <+klone_iron_fist> that being said "gearing is hard with gold" most toons are over geared when getting to content.
[2023-01-03 18:06:21] <%polig> there is no one that like that base of what this game is
[2023-01-03 18:06:23] <irrationale2> I think chaos dungeons should be like tower defense where you have constant swarm of monsters,. now u have to wait till they spawn after each kill
[2023-01-03 18:06:24] <%+DennySommer> I have note don my weeklys over a month now every chars has 15+ boos cub tickets xdd
[2023-01-03 18:06:31] <%+Hi_Im_JJ> Yeah it's just like what I said yesterday, the fact that the game balance is good enough to the point where we can agree or disagree how easy a class is to play and have both opinions be valid is just so nice.
[2023-01-03 18:06:38] <%+TrickmasteH> The vast majority of poeple hate chaos dungeon / guardians
[2023-01-03 18:06:52] <+klone_iron_fist> 12 chaos dungeons a day, 12 guardians a day with a 6 cjaracter roster, which impacts your game A LOT gets daunting, which causes burnout
[2023-01-03 18:06:53] <%+DennySommer> even use resting system you will burn out
[2023-01-03 18:06:56] <%+TrickmasteH> some even hate the repetitiveness of the same raids every week too
[2023-01-03 18:07:08] VIEWERS: 580
[2023-01-03 18:07:14] <%Nikodermos> you know thats a good highlight of the difference
[2023-01-03 18:07:38] <%Nikodermos> the few times i show the game off , i go into c dung to show the abilites of the class to the person
[2023-01-03 18:07:47] <%polig> if you go by that logic and everyone that dislike daily grind leaves you would have hay barrels flying around instead of players xD do something else if you dont like some points of something you enjoy is bad logic
[2023-01-03 18:08:02] <%+DennySommer> i hate doing same raids on 6 chars  every week 18 raids of the same shit without argos crap
[2023-01-03 18:08:12] <+klone_iron_fist> Chaos Dungeon weekly, every statue you break open like in the thrid phase, the pack is harder, you go until you die andgame rewards you for the further you get.
[2023-01-03 18:08:24] <%Nikodermos> i dont say , hey let me show u a 10-20 min raid  we can do once a week
[2023-01-03 18:08:28] <%+TrickmasteH> A mental challenge in the chaos dungeon something like in POE, what was that system where you would go and get that rng map and have to solve the puzzle @Baker
[2023-01-03 18:08:31] <%Nikodermos> i show the core of the game off
[2023-01-03 18:08:41] <%Nikodermos> to each their own
[2023-01-03 18:08:49] <+klone_iron_fist> @TrickmasteH LAB?
[2023-01-03 18:08:50] <%Nikodermos> smoking and lurking
[2023-01-03 18:08:54] <%+TrickmasteH> yes klone
[2023-01-03 18:08:55] <%+TrickmasteH> like lab
[2023-01-03 18:08:57] <%+TrickmasteH> excactly
[2023-01-03 18:09:06] <%+TrickmasteH> yep
[2023-01-03 18:09:08] VIEWERS: 580
[2023-01-03 18:09:20] <%+TrickmasteH> if you pass the challenge, you get a benificial reward
[2023-01-03 18:09:31] <%+TrickmasteH> and hopefully its hard enough to prevent bots from completing it of course.
[2023-01-03 18:09:43] <%Nikodermos> the gate system on dungs could defn go
[2023-01-03 18:09:50] <%+DennySommer> Make it auto runing xdd
[2023-01-03 18:10:00] <MRxVIKO> hmm, i would like to see chaos bosses with mechs

[2023-01-03 18:10:34] <%+TrickmasteH> i think making challenges within the dailiy activitys that actually stimulates our mind is important.
[2023-01-03 18:10:43] <MRxVIKO> A chaos dungeons similair to raids, that has mechs would be fun
[2023-01-03 18:10:43] <%+DennySommer> Last before reset is pain
[2023-01-03 18:10:45] <%+TrickmasteH> Otherwise we are just slaves in a mine.
[2023-01-03 18:10:47] <+batobatoidea> even an easy mech on the chaos boss could screw up the bots' ability to complete the dungeon, might help
[2023-01-03 18:10:50] <raniegro> also quality system is trash, after u hit for example 85-95 quality weapon u are hardstucked and cant make it higher without spending milions of gold ( imagine this happens on your main ), they should add   craftable item that allows you to get 1-3% guaranteed quality upgrade for idk like 50chaos stones
[2023-01-03 18:11:04] <%polig> @raniegro recraft

[2023-01-03 18:11:16] <%polig> fixed
[2023-01-03 18:11:20] <%Nikodermos> personally i have thought that the best way to fix the skins lack is more c dung set drops like the maze set that drops , if u have a wider pool of rare drops that can come from those rare portals it makes things a bit more fun to the hunting/farming side
[2023-01-03 18:11:48] <%polig> why do you have to have 100 grade anyway? xD
[2023-01-03 18:11:49] <@%^Streamlabs> because it's the best.
[2023-01-03 18:11:55] <%Nikodermos> or even transmogs for the t1/t2 items appearance
