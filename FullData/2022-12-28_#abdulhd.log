[2022-12-28 15:12:08] <+MountainMAN1990> it's when the stick doesn't stay still and it makes you walk
[2022-12-28 15:12:26] <+Kiiismet> the dpad on this controller is good for fighting games
[2022-12-28 15:12:27] <+M3RLN> Stick drift happens when one of your analog sticks starts to move by itself without you pressing it
[2022-12-28 15:12:34] <+MountainMAN1990> yep
[2022-12-28 15:12:35] <leighton_james> me watching this thinking of the headset that is only together due to a roll of tape
[2022-12-28 15:12:43] <@%Salem7> Its when the stick drifts while it should be sitting still, basically when the sensors get dirty or old and the sensor thinks youre moving it.
[2022-12-28 15:12:45] <bobby_nova_tgc> sticks register movement without touching them
[2022-12-28 15:12:50] <yesimtheshortone> yes
[2022-12-28 15:12:50] <+M3RLN> exactly
[2022-12-28 15:13:21] <+ChillySpunc> Stick drift is inevitable with wear and tear and faulty manufacturing

[2022-12-28 17:16:21] <%BooneDog_HD> Hello Habibi. This is my first comment ever. I usually like my entertainment passive and not interactive, but for you I've made an exception.  I want to thank you and your community for the years of content. Someone named xQc recently gifted me a sub, out of the blue, and for that reason I decided to change my name and join the HD crew.  I only watch you and one other streamer and he won't care. In fact, your brief interaction with him is what brought me to your channel. Have a happy New Year!

[2022-12-28 17:40:48] <austin9042> this is why Mosquitoes cannot transmit HIV for two reasons. Firstly, when the mosquito bites with its probosis, it draws blood and injects saliva, which contains antiviral factors and immunoglobulins and hence cannot transmit HIV. The blood from one person is not injected into the mosquito's next victim
[2022-12-28 17:40:49] <%insane_dictator_DMCA> aids is the resulf of men fucking chimapnzees no kappa

Badr uses the Hot version which is the strongest.
