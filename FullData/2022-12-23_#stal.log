[2022-12-23 14:49:11] <%SlimeMush> It looks flashy but playing it is
[2022-12-23 14:49:16] <%BoysAreVeryCute> whats bad about bard, managing dots and songs and all that stuff, or smth else

[2022-12-23 14:49:28] <%BoysAreVeryCute> tho i did recently make a venti glam so i wanna play it more
[2022-12-23 14:49:28] <+Ashidomus> RPR I like the burst, but it is indeed boring in the long run overall
[2022-12-23 14:49:47] <%79james> i have not played my bard this xpac, it was my main b4, just so bored of it now
[2022-12-23 14:49:53] <%+Nesprito> I like being Tanky in games so I'll keep playing tanks lol
[2022-12-23 14:49:55] <+iraizunia> FFXIV deciding to go down a simplifying route has kinda ruined the game for me atm, everything feels too similar
[2022-12-23 14:49:56] <%DoctorTog> i play ranged because vibes and fun but brd is Sadge right now
[2022-12-23 14:50:01] <%Cetonis> Bard used to have lots of help the party buttons and skill expression, SE removed all of it in ShB and only gave us a tiny bit back in EW
[2022-12-23 14:50:09] <%+Nesprito> that said I'm very afraid of playing Tank on console. it's just so different D:
[2022-12-23 14:50:12] <%DoctorTog> army's being 43 but mage's short is so cursed

[2022-12-23 14:50:33] <%SlimeMush> The rotation is very dull and kinda awkward cause of how they want everything in 2 min

[2022-12-23 14:50:43] <%Mungola> current bard is very stiff also. moving thru songs to get that 2mins.
[2022-12-23 14:50:49] <%SlimeMush> ^
[2022-12-23 14:51:10] <+iraizunia> give bard red mages gap closer but replace the rapier with an arrow
[2022-12-23 14:51:12] <%DoctorTog> the only interesting thing about brd right now is when there's downtime so you need to adjust songs like barb ex and p2s
[2022-12-23 14:51:25] <%Krilwya> copium they'll rework it
[2022-12-23 14:51:30] <%DoctorTog> oh yeah for sure
[2022-12-23 14:51:35] <%+Pumptime> I like boring sometimes… smooth brain hours
[2022-12-23 14:51:35] <+Ashidomus> You are making me even more worried how I am gonna feel about PLD when I try it KEKW
[2022-12-23 14:51:38] <%79james> i feel like they forgot bard was in the game, till 5mins b4 release and then just chucked some stuff at it
[2022-12-23 14:51:42] <%Cetonis> SE rushed a rework of the media tour build that they didn't need to do, released it half-broken and then just.... kinda left it that way
[2022-12-23 14:51:53] <%nameinusage> waow... those are strong feelings about brd stalalaSweat
[2022-12-23 14:51:54] <%DoctorTog> yeah and if you forget you fuck your songs up for the whole fight stalalaLMAO
[2022-12-23 14:51:56] <%SlimeMush> I think a lot of the issues is just them enforcing 2 min meta when they didn’t need to. Can only hope it gets changed for 7.0
[2022-12-23 14:52:09] <%SlimeMush> Yeah idk why they changed stuff from the media tour

[2022-12-23 14:52:52] <%BoysAreVeryCute> @SlimeMush idk i think 2min meta is so entrenched in the game that so much stuff is designed around it combat wise that in order to move away form it would be like maybe the expansion after the next one
[2022-12-23 14:52:55] <%79james> will always be my fav job, i am just playing it, till they remember its in game
[2022-12-23 14:53:14] <%79james> done playing it *
[2022-12-23 14:53:14] <+iraizunia> complexity isn't a bad thing, idk why they're so against it
[2022-12-23 14:53:19] <%Mungola> shb bard had it's own burst windows and the big one was way rarer than the current 2min spam. way more flexibility when you have raging strikes on short cooldown and songs being spells etc.
[2022-12-23 14:53:22] <%SlimeMush> @boysareverycute it only got super heavily enforced this expansion
[2022-12-23 14:53:24] <%DoctorTog> i'd like it if they gave us some like 90s stuff back, even if it was personal stuff
[2022-12-23 14:53:36] <%Cetonis> they could make dealing damage easy and let people express skill with support button usage, but they won't even do that
[2022-12-23 14:53:39] <+Ashidomus> 2min is killing variety of jobs a lot and fights can be very annoying with 2min, like dog vs snake first in P8s
[2022-12-23 14:53:39] <%BoysAreVeryCute> the game is designed for wide appeal and console players
[2022-12-23 14:53:46] <%spellsword91> its because by making things easier they achieve growth which is their main concern
[2022-12-23 14:53:49] <%SlimeMush> ShB moved towards it but there was still some flexibility

[2022-12-23 14:54:10] <%79james> i think there should be different skill levels, to give ppl choice

[2022-12-23 14:54:17] <%Krilwya> removing skill floor is always a good thing imho, but the ceiling should be kept as high as possible

[2022-12-23 14:55:06] <+iraizunia> I think by making jobs easier they're pushing more people away than bringing them in, as people play more they want more challenge. Eventually they'll leave to like WoW or something cuz they have more complexity
[2022-12-23 14:55:16] <+HoLeeShet> is there also TOKYO subs?
[2022-12-23 14:55:30] <%pontirak> savage in pugs is still pretty yikes, I was on p8s p1 a2c for a few weeks and just gave up9 because pugs were a nightmare
[2022-12-23 14:55:32] <%SlimeMush> Majority of players are casual though @iraizunia
[2022-12-23 14:55:35] <%HidekiKojima> just make a savage savage mode ok
[2022-12-23 14:55:37] <%Krilwya> @iraizunia WoW is also becoming way more casual
[2022-12-23 14:55:53] <%DoctorTog> casual that does hc raid hours to get it over with quicker NODDERS
[2022-12-23 14:55:59] <%BoysAreVeryCute> id be amazed if even 0.05 of active players cleared dsr ngl
[2022-12-23 14:55:59] <+Ashidomus> I like where current savage is personally. I can play with my friends that are not that great and prog something
[2022-12-23 14:56:07] <%DoctorTog> Q kidnapped you into HC
[2022-12-23 14:56:21] <%Cetonis> If you think about the base audience of people who play the FF series, by definition they like JRPG battle systems where you make decisions about what skills to use
[2022-12-23 14:56:34] <%Cetonis> but that's been drained from 14

[2022-12-23 14:57:07] <+iraizunia> @SlimeMush oh I know, but I feel like over time even casuals want some challenge. I'm a casual but dungeons and stuff are boring because the rotations aren't interesting

[2022-12-23 14:57:31] <%SlimeMush> I just want stuff not to only be 2 min because it makes DPS over the course of a fight so volatile and inflexible
[2022-12-23 14:57:36] <%79james> i was never into raiding till i started to watch you, now i force my friends to raid with me :P
[2022-12-23 14:57:50] <%Cetonis> I just want some flexibility and decision making, it doesn't need to be insane but let me feel like I can do something to play better besides prayRNG

[2022-12-23 14:58:17] <%SlimeMush> Yeah, there’s no variety by putting it all on 2 min
[2022-12-23 14:58:18] <%DoctorTog> songs being spells was such a huge QoL
[2022-12-23 14:58:25] <%Keld__> I like 2min burst but thats cause i liked hw mch. Its most certainly isnt for everyone and shouldnt be on every class.

[2022-12-23 14:59:47] <%SlimeMush> That’s what I liked about the MCH rework for ShB, because you could adjust when you bursted based on party comp. Now it suffers from the 2 min meta same as PLD does
[2022-12-23 14:59:53] <%valfayr> no more translators, damn i hope they got good ones
[2022-12-23 15:00:14] <%+Pumptime> I care to clear so the rotation doesn’t matter to me for the most part. Guess we all have different fun which variety gameplay is nice
