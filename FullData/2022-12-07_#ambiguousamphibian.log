[2022-12-07 17:32:28] <fratriarch> it makes 10 if theres less than 25?
[2022-12-07 17:32:29] <+teraaabyte> 25 is the condition, 10 is the amount to be made
[2022-12-07 17:32:31] <Dumbsnarky> That's how many times they will do the task when the condition is triggered.
[2022-12-07 17:32:34] <MyuraJinsei> ı didnt played before
[2022-12-07 17:32:35] <HowlingBark7> @ambiguousamphibian 25 is the check, 10 is hte work amount
[2022-12-07 17:32:38] <ChilliDogDave> @ambiguousamphibian manager being a dummy and guessing because he doesnt have an office
[2022-12-07 17:32:46] <liiqi_> ambiSnek
[2022-12-07 17:32:48] <cloudsoda> you only got 10 plump helmets?
[2022-12-07 17:32:56] <+Retro42JL> Cooking is kinda a bad idea until you have a solid farm/seed supply
[2022-12-07 17:33:00] <%+seymour47> So, if you have 25, it makes 10?
[2022-12-07 17:33:04] <%thejatman_> This game looks just as complicated as I thought it would
[2022-12-07 17:33:10] <%+JaneWhitwork> Are ya winnin' son?
[2022-12-07 17:33:14] <fratriarch> brews 25 if below 25 now
[2022-12-07 17:33:15] <$deadlikeyou11> if you have 24, you will make 10 more. if you have 14, you will make 10, then make 10 more
[2022-12-07 17:33:20] <fratriarch> sounds good
[2022-12-07 17:33:26] <+teraaabyte> @seymour47 now you changed it to make 25 when less than 25
[2022-12-07 17:33:33] <Stretchbuddy> Yeah agreed
[2022-12-07 17:33:34] <parawerke> 10 is the step size
[2022-12-07 17:33:46] <YourShadowDani> tileset looks great
[2022-12-07 17:33:48] <seraphimdunham> wait is that silver in the main enterence hall?
[2022-12-07 17:33:51] <cloudsoda> I like that you get to customize the fuck out of your king in CK
[2022-12-07 17:33:54] <suckscriber> that wasnt only in ck3
[2022-12-07 17:33:54] <KnukN> you should rename a dwarf to "john beard"
[2022-12-07 17:33:56] <TheRoggle> He doesn't like the game btw
[2022-12-07 17:33:58] VIEWERS: 2 430
[2022-12-07 17:34:02] <suckscriber> or was it
[2022-12-07 17:34:03] <Sherkath> is this version just as complex as the text-based one?
[2022-12-07 17:34:11] <+teraaabyte> @Sherkath yes
[2022-12-07 17:34:15] <%akrogon> @Sherkath Yep, just improved UI
[2022-12-07 17:34:20] <seraphimdunham> @Sherkath it is the text based one with a coat of paint and a new ui
[2022-12-07 17:34:22] <Stretchbuddy> @Sherkath Easier to use, just as complex.
[2022-12-07 17:34:24] <cystic_pizza> @Sherkath it's the exact same game with mouse support and graphics
[2022-12-07 17:34:25] <+Retro42JL> Same game, new ui
[2022-12-07 17:34:26] <+teraaabyte> @Sherkath but with way better GUI and tutorials
[2022-12-07 17:34:29] <%akrogon> The engine is virtually identical
[2022-12-07 17:34:51] <fastets> rush b
[2022-12-07 17:34:51] <%akrogon> Although different enough that the DFHack contributors have to redo all their memory mapping
[2022-12-07 17:34:52] <Sherkath> Aaah, I see, so all the crazy shenanigans are still in this one, perfect xD
[2022-12-07 17:34:55] <Bohnenblatt> @Sherkath yes just improved UI. That is different from previous iterations. So veteran players need to learn controls again
[2022-12-07 17:34:57] <TheRoggle> Does anything ever happen in this game? How long till something interesting happens?
[2022-12-07 17:34:58] <FrozenMonkey> Pdoors.  the P is silent
[2022-12-07 17:35:07] <+moldy_fuzz> i heard performance is greatly improved over the original too?
[2022-12-07 17:35:08] <%akrogon> Yes, shenanigans (!!FUN!!) are untouched
[2022-12-07 17:35:09] <+Retro42JL> AFAIK the whole no adventure mode thing isn't engine related but no UI made yet
[2022-12-07 17:35:11] <KnukN> are there enemies that can break down doors
[2022-12-07 17:35:17] <Alisphere> ambiSnek
[2022-12-07 17:35:17] <juaneshpta> ambiSnek
[2022-12-07 17:35:20] <cloudsoda> @KnukN yes LUL
[2022-12-07 17:35:20] <Rexxig> anyone experiencing random crashes ?
[2022-12-07 17:35:21] <silhoucat> Tudors?
[2022-12-07 17:35:22] <%akrogon> @moldy_fuzz I hope that's true, it's still single threaded AFAIK
[2022-12-07 17:35:24] <cloudsoda> "clowns" can
[2022-12-07 17:35:27] <+teraaabyte> @TheRoggle zombie, wild animal, goblin attack, just to name a few
[2022-12-07 17:35:27] <WellingtonSkellington> @KnukN yes
[2022-12-07 17:35:28] <Bohnenblatt> @KnukN Yes. But not everything that attacks you
[2022-12-07 17:35:31] <+hyperhopper> @TheRoggle depends on how happy he keeps his dwarfs, depends on how far he digs, depends on how much wealth his fort generates
[2022-12-07 17:35:33] <+A_fluffy_pillow> Any cell biologists/microbiologists here and fancy helping me with an exam? LUL
[2022-12-07 17:35:42] <+kralec> oh my god! WOOD! Clap
[2022-12-07 17:35:44] <KnukN> yeah usually I go with drawbridge
[2022-12-07 17:35:45] <+moldy_fuzz> @moldy_fuzz I saw some saying it has more multithreading but didn't see a source
[2022-12-07 17:35:50] <+teraaabyte> @A_fluffy_pillow something something semipermeable membrane
[2022-12-07 17:35:55] <%+JaneWhitwork> Corpses

[2022-12-07 17:36:00] <%akrogon> @moldy_fuzz Ooo, I hope so!!
[2022-12-07 17:36:05] <cystic_pizza> naw keep corpses outside
[2022-12-07 17:36:06] <Bohnenblatt> @ambiguousamphibian you see food stocks at the top
[2022-12-07 17:36:08] <+A_fluffy_pillow> @A_fluffy_pillow Incredible, thank you
[2022-12-07 17:36:09] <cystic_pizza> if you keep them inside you'll get miasma
[2022-12-07 17:36:12] <cystic_pizza> and everyone barfs
[2022-12-07 17:36:19] <seraphimdunham> slapdash?
[2022-12-07 17:36:22] <cloudsoda> top UI needs little icons for food and stuff, like in age of empires
[2022-12-07 17:36:24] <+hyperhopper> @TheRoggle if you are a little tiny hole in the ground nothing fucks with you. if you fuck up, your fort will start to collapse on itself though. and if you make a dank fort, then FUN starts to come for you
[2022-12-07 17:36:31] <%+JaneWhitwork> @cystic_pizza No honest dwarf would want to be buried above ground ;)
[2022-12-07 17:36:31] <+SouDescolado> Bottom left stockpile not symmetrical. Please fix?
[2022-12-07 17:36:39] <Yellowone_1> in the end of the day, a cemetery is just a corpses stockpile

[2022-12-07 17:37:08] <cystic_pizza> the miasma pisses dorfs off and makes them sick lol
[2022-12-07 17:37:18] <AntiOrdinary> its dworbin time
[2022-12-07 17:37:20] <TapdancingNinja> Totally cant be taken out of context’s
[2022-12-07 17:37:31] <+Doffney> Rimworld was inspired by Dwarf fortress no?
[2022-12-07 17:37:32] <emp_john_romero> the dwarfs are economical
[2022-12-07 17:37:32] <seraphimdunham> i will admit sometimes i like playing rimworld
[2022-12-07 17:37:32] <cloudsoda> is there friendly fire in dorf?
[2022-12-07 17:37:36] <+moldy_fuzz> 2x3, such luxury

[2022-12-07 17:38:02] <%akrogon> I love Rimworld and DF, but definitely prefer DF
[2022-12-07 17:38:09] <Zyhmos> @ambiguousamphibian Ctrl+R record. Ctrl+P play
[2022-12-07 17:38:12] <liiqi_> hai der, came from yt! I wanted to say that your videos are so nice and calming!

[2022-12-07 17:38:35] <cloudsoda> punch it?
[2022-12-07 17:38:36] <timeandaraf> click the wagon
[2022-12-07 17:38:37] <+teraaabyte> top right
[2022-12-07 17:38:41] <seraphimdunham> @ambiguousamphibian the little X at the top right corner
[2022-12-07 17:38:43] <Boraxx92> click on it, then the decunstuct icon
[2022-12-07 17:39:00] <%+JaneWhitwork> This is like watching an ant farm
[2022-12-07 17:39:03] <+moldy_fuzz> I have noticed it's easy to miss alerts
[2022-12-07 17:39:15] <+teraaabyte> @moldy_fuzz yeah they no longer pause the game for most alerts
[2022-12-07 17:39:19] <+SouDescolado> Stockpile bottom left not symmetrical
[2022-12-07 17:39:19] <cloudsoda> click on the wagon itself
[2022-12-07 17:39:23] <%akrogon> @moldy_fuzz I saw a workshop mod just today that adds an alert sound
[2022-12-07 17:39:24] <%+seymour47> Never forgiven.
[2022-12-07 17:39:27] <+GShogun> @moldy_fuzz yeah i've noticed that as as common complaint
[2022-12-07 17:39:28] <seraphimdunham> you need to select the wagon first! @ambiguousamphibian
[2022-12-07 17:39:33] <+GShogun> it's not as prominent as it could be
[2022-12-07 17:39:44] <+moldy_fuzz> @moldy_fuzz nice!! gonna check it out
[2022-12-07 17:39:51] <Sch0ckrazor> If you click on a dwarf you can use the camera icon to follow him around
[2022-12-07 17:39:56] <ExtraRaven> can you make your dwarf fortress outside

[2022-12-07 17:40:00] <kagirabunne> GOLD
[2022-12-07 17:40:04] <+imscomobob> @ambiguousamphibian when you build - if you toggle advanced options, you can set work priority
[2022-12-07 17:40:05] <timeandaraf> You can set mining priorities by expanding. So you can set this mine at priority 1 - 10 or something like that
[2022-12-07 17:40:22] <nagamommy> dwarves have offices? my mind is blown
[2022-12-07 17:40:29] <+moldy_fuzz> i forgot how quickly time passes when i play this game... almost stayed up all night
[2022-12-07 17:40:34] <%akrogon> @ExtraRaven You definitely can, but dwarves are much faster at digging than building
[2022-12-07 17:40:34] <%+slippry_john> oh boy, more than two tiles for the dwarven rooms, how opulent
[2022-12-07 17:40:44] <%akrogon> ^ LUL
[2022-12-07 17:40:45] <casinocop> this looks complicated
[2022-12-07 17:40:51] <kagirabunne> @nagamommy Where else is your bookkeeper going to count every mushroom
[2022-12-07 17:40:53] <+teraaabyte> @ambiguousamphibian if your manager doesn't have an office you can't give orders
[2022-12-07 17:40:59] <cloudsoda> @ambiguousamphibian if you click the wagon itself you can deconstruct it by clicking the x in the corner
[2022-12-07 17:41:05] <emma_smileyface> tysm for this tutorial, this is great
[2022-12-07 17:41:06] <TapdancingNinja> Do we have booze yet
[2022-12-07 17:41:18] <RutgerRNG> He hasnt deconstructed his wagon yet?
[2022-12-07 17:41:26] <+imscomobob> "Use Closest Material"
[2022-12-07 17:41:30] <+Tooizy> You can use the closest material option
[2022-12-07 17:41:30] <HowlingBark7> @ambiguousamphibian is you select use nearest material when building, you wont have to select which door to use
[2022-12-07 17:41:38] <skinnyhunn> zippy zippy hole
[2022-12-07 17:41:55] <RutgerRNG> oh shit bedrooms are zones now?
[2022-12-07 17:41:57] <emp_john_romero> the dwarfs  see the difference
[2022-12-07 17:41:58] VIEWERS: 2 587
[2022-12-07 17:42:05] <pieboy321> you should include the walls, it increases the value of the room and can give happy thoughts
[2022-12-07 17:42:15] <%akrogon> If you include the walls in the room zone and engrave them, the engravings contribute to the room quality
[2022-12-07 17:42:20] <Bohnenblatt> @RutgerRNG yes but you can select multiple rooms with one click
[2022-12-07 17:42:22] <%+JaneWhitwork> I am a dorf and I'm dorfing a dorf, dorfing a dorf, dorfy dorfy dorf
[2022-12-07 17:42:27] <+teraaabyte> @RutgerRNG you can mass designate bedrooms now if they are in separate rooms with doors and beds
[2022-12-07 17:42:45] <RutgerRNG> My mind is being blown by the minute
[2022-12-07 17:42:47] <kagirabunne> @ambiguousamphibian If you select Multi before placing hte bedroom, you can select a whole row of rooms in the rectangle and it will make a room for each one as long as they're enclosed
[2022-12-07 17:43:05] <cloudsoda> you get swamped
[2022-12-07 17:43:12] <+Tooizy> You got some migrants comming right now @ambiguousamphibian !
[2022-12-07 17:43:19] <%akrogon> @RutgerRNG My muscle memory is absolutely rekt
[2022-12-07 17:43:43] <kagirabunne> Needs chairs
[2022-12-07 17:43:44] <lithaiku> ah yes, the first people that get rooms are the government, army and scholar dwarves. this will be the basis of dwarf proletariat revolution war in the future
[2022-12-07 17:43:46] <TheRoggle> Man this game is a sleeping aid

[2022-12-07 17:44:02] <kedzar> so hows this version, it's the same, better or worse than the original edition of DF ?
[2022-12-07 17:44:10] <kagirabunne> @ambiguousamphibian Yeah you're doing it right, it just needs the furniture or at least a chair

[2022-12-07 17:44:32] <3lanca> yep the furniture needs to be placed
[2022-12-07 17:44:33] <+GShogun> dolomite is a flux stone, hopefully that means magnetite and hematite is nearby
[2022-12-07 17:44:36] <%akrogon> @earthmeLon It's coming soon, but I've heard folks are running it fine with Wine

[2022-12-07 17:45:52] <+moldy_fuzz> same thing, chairs are wood
[2022-12-07 17:45:52] <emp_john_romero> a throne is just a different kind of chair

[2022-12-07 17:46:02] <tribaja> @ambiguousamphibian Thrones are from rock, chairs are wood
[2022-12-07 17:46:02] <+GShogun> thrones are chairs just made of rocks
[2022-12-07 17:46:10] <+KravenLupei> dwarves prefer stone thrones :)
[2022-12-07 17:46:12] <%+slippry_john> the only difference is the material
[2022-12-07 17:46:12] <+LieutenantMilk> well youre not a dorf
[2022-12-07 17:46:12] <ChilliDogDave> @ambiguousamphibian thrones are noble chairs usually reserved for very needy dorfs
[2022-12-07 17:46:12] <Tumuel> A chair is a wooden throne from what I understand
[2022-12-07 17:46:13] <+KravenLupei> wood is for elves
[2022-12-07 17:46:13] <HowlingBark7> resource thing i'd guess
[2022-12-07 17:46:15] <%+Kellgoth> Dwarves love their stone stuff though
[2022-12-07 17:46:16] <Bohnenblatt> But stones are usually more plentiful than wood
[2022-12-07 17:46:16] <ummyeah1929> how about a wood throne
[2022-12-07 17:46:17] <%+JaneWhitwork> A dorf would enjoy stone
[2022-12-07 17:46:17] <cloudsoda> @Tumuel lol
[2022-12-07 17:46:19] <+teraaabyte> Real dwarves use rock, but no gameplay effect
[2022-12-07 17:46:20] <+DragooKnight11> They’re Dwarves, they usually like stones more
[2022-12-07 17:46:21] <+Z4n4duz> Stone thrones sound cold
[2022-12-07 17:46:22] <%akrogon> Thrones and chairs are identical, just different names based on the material
[2022-12-07 17:46:23] <069lelele069> dwarves have harder buttcheeks than humans
[2022-12-07 17:46:24] <emp_john_romero> only a Nobleman will  care about the difference between a Chair and a Throne
[2022-12-07 17:46:32] <+iAmKetPain> where's my gold throne? Kappa
[2022-12-07 17:46:36] <+moldy_fuzz> a dwarf could have a personality trait that prefers a certain material
[2022-12-07 17:46:36] <+GShogun> yes
[2022-12-07 17:46:38] <%+Harqinz> yay more dwarfing! Stone furniture has a higher potential beauty stat, wood will always be wood.
[2022-12-07 17:46:39] <cloudsoda> @069lelele069 must make buttsex kinda hard
[2022-12-07 17:46:40] <+GShogun> just stonemade

[2022-12-07 17:46:50] <+Jaromero435> I'd rather sit on the porcelain throne
[2022-12-07 17:46:50] <%+Yodathecool1> some materials are worth more, but the biggest factor is gonna be craftsmanship
[2022-12-07 17:46:50] <kagirabunne> It just depends on the material
[2022-12-07 17:46:50] <+moldy_fuzz> no, wooden chair is a different work order
[2022-12-07 17:46:56] <mistuhhezakiah> Dwarves like stone. But they also like pissing off elves by cutting down trees. Tough choice.

[2022-12-07 17:47:06] <Bohnenblatt> @ambiguousamphibian watch out. They will now make another 10 chairs when you have 9. So you will end up with 19 chairs
[2022-12-07 17:47:09] <seraphimdunham> dwarves always prefer stone from what i understand, some dwarves can have a preference for certain materials, and you are way more likely to get a favorite stone than a favorite wood

[2022-12-07 17:48:00] <+DragooKnight11> Thrones are usually better because dorfs tend to prefer a type of stone over logs. Likely gives happy thoughts if their throne matches their favorite stone, but don’t quote me on that.

[2022-12-07 17:54:24] <+hyperhopper> before it was just the checkered tile on the ground with most tileset
[2022-12-07 17:54:32] <+Roninsix> Is it too early to ask dwarf fortress or rimworld if you had to choose?

[2022-12-07 17:58:38] <hopman42> It is decreased
[2022-12-07 17:58:40] <+GShogun> wheelbarrows help with that
[2022-12-07 17:58:41] <+ibgoge> 100%
[2022-12-07 17:58:42] <Stretchbuddy> It is
[2022-12-07 17:58:43] <+LieutenantMilk> yes
[2022-12-07 17:58:45] <+iAmKetPain> yeah weight plays a factor
[2022-12-07 17:58:45] <Chiablo> Rocks are heavy
[2022-12-07 17:58:46] <+moldy_fuzz> @ambiguousamphibian make wheelbarrows and assign them to stockpiles
[2022-12-07 17:58:48] <seraphimdunham> @ZachTheNebula you want to put a table next to it because they can sometimes choose to eat in their office and then they complain that they dont have a table to eat on
[2022-12-07 17:58:49] <+nropevoli23> Is it decreased when walking over stuff?
[2022-12-07 17:58:49] <CaptainClue93> yes it is
[2022-12-07 17:58:49] <+krip123> I hope this sells really well. Tarn and Zack really deserve it
[2022-12-07 17:58:49] <+ibgoge> give them a wheelbarrel
[2022-12-07 17:58:51] <+LieutenantMilk> wheelbarrows help a lot
[2022-12-07 17:58:52] <Dumbsnarky> It is, wheelbarrows can be designated to the stockpiles
[2022-12-07 17:58:54] <HarlemGlobetrotter> yeah 100%, that's why stone blocks are great because they're lighter
[2022-12-07 17:59:00] <hopman42> You can add more wheelbarrows to stockpiles
[2022-12-07 17:59:00] <+GShogun> you can designate an amount of wheelbarrows per stockpile, too
[2022-12-07 17:59:10] <%+Harqinz> give them a *supply* of wheelbarrows they'll use them interchangably between all heavy item stockpiles
[2022-12-07 17:59:14] <+GShogun> @HarlemGlobetrotter exactly
[2022-12-07 17:59:16] <ZachTheNebula> A lot of alerts lol
[2022-12-07 17:59:20] <Kijiro> Yes, and if your dwarf is wearing 500 lead crowns they will also slow down.
[2022-12-07 17:59:22] <+GShogun> stone blocks make things way more efficient
[2022-12-07 17:59:26] <+kishmond> Some of your dwarves are getting unhappy thoughts. Can you check what these are?

[2022-12-07 17:59:56] <%akrogon> @Yodathecool1 Were they allowed to be cooked or eaten?

[2022-12-07 18:00:00] <Siilis108> You cooked all the plump helmets. It doesnt give seeds. Need to brew them.

[2022-12-07 18:00:03] <%$Flying_Nostril> you have to process the plants into seeds
[2022-12-07 18:00:06] <+GShogun> because a dorf liaison usually shows up with a caravan
[2022-12-07 18:00:07] <cloudsoda> that wagon is begging to be taken apart
[2022-12-07 18:00:16] <+GShogun> lol
[2022-12-07 18:00:16] <Kijiro> Does brewing still give seeds?
[2022-12-07 18:00:19] <Bohnenblatt> @Yodathecool1 make sure that you dont use plump helmets for cooking. Cooking will not give a seed. Brewing and eating it raw does
[2022-12-07 18:00:19] <%+seymour47> There's plenty of time to get the depot set up after the trader arrives.
[2022-12-07 18:00:19] <cloudsoda> pfft
[2022-12-07 18:00:21] <+ibgoge> @Yodathecool1 if they were all planted you need to wait for them to grow and brew again to get more seeds  it only starts you with 5 seeds which is not nearly enough
[2022-12-07 18:00:22] <+GShogun> "Some migrants have arrived."

[2022-12-07 18:03:44] <+digital_fartist> is this game really hard to learn ?looks very complex
[2022-12-07 18:03:44] <+TheGhostlyOnyx> @Nico_tsb let him play what he wants and everyone here wants to see df
[2022-12-07 18:03:46] <Yellowone_1> dead amphibians D:
[2022-12-07 18:03:49] <+Zakaluka15> my dwarves won't haul anything to the dump even if i mark it for dumping, very confuse
[2022-12-07 18:03:53] <+moldy_fuzz> the df wiki is still relevant, thankfully
[2022-12-07 18:03:59] <+imav1ctor> how does this compare to rimworld? I know it's much more complex but can anybody who has played both chime in?

[2022-12-07 18:04:12] <Nico_tsb> @TheGhostlyOnyx Chill dude, was a joke. Stop taking people on Twitch seriously.
[2022-12-07 18:04:15] <+GShogun> @Zakaluka15 are the things they're supposed to be hauling accessible or forbidden?
[2022-12-07 18:04:15] <cloudsoda> buy some chickens
[2022-12-07 18:04:15] <+teraaabyte> @Zakaluka15 do you have multiple dumps?
[2022-12-07 18:04:17] <%+seymour47> @Nico_tsb A large raid comes in and some random person just tells the streamer to play something else? How the hell else are we supposed to take it?
[2022-12-07 18:04:18] <WellingtonSkellington> @imav1ctor this has more complex and in depth systems

[2022-12-07 18:04:19] <+Zakaluka15> one dump
[2022-12-07 18:04:24] <bigscreebo> go to the help page it explains it pretty well!!
[2022-12-07 18:04:27] <+Zakaluka15> nothing is forbidden
[2022-12-07 18:04:28] <cystic_pizza> @imav1ctor you answered your own question -- this game is much more in depth/complex and it's 20 years old
[2022-12-07 18:04:29] <Bohnenblatt> @ambiguousamphibian trading is really easy. Just move thing you want to sell to the depot and then trade like rimworld
[2022-12-07 18:04:31] <Nico_tsb> @seymour47 Imagine getting upset over a Twitch chat. Ouch
[2022-12-07 18:04:35] <+TheGhostlyOnyx> @Nico_tsb you clearly weren't joking
[2022-12-07 18:04:35] <+SpaceGhost8> no mug industry?
[2022-12-07 18:04:42] <+GShogun> yeah trading is super easy
[2022-12-07 18:04:43] <+imav1ctor> hm
[2022-12-07 18:04:45] <friscoborn> sell them bone cups, buddy!
[2022-12-07 18:04:47] <%+Yodathecool1> yeah, i had issues trading.... it didn't let me move the cut gems i had to the depot. they didn't appear in the menu for moving
[2022-12-07 18:04:50] <bigscreebo> go to the help page it explains it
[2022-12-07 18:04:51] <%akrogon> @imav1ctor It's more difficult to learn how to play, but the emergent storytelling is top notch
[2022-12-07 18:04:51] <+CornFrogInTheCornFog> Not trading increases the odds of FUN :D
[2022-12-07 18:04:52] <cloudsoda> deconstruct the wagon, get the materials!
[2022-12-07 18:04:57] <Nico_tsb> @TheGhostlyOnyx You clearly don't know what you're talking about. :-)
[2022-12-07 18:05:00] <%+seymour47> @Nico_tsb Imagine thinking being a dipshit in a chat makes it ok?
[2022-12-07 18:05:03] <+GShogun> are spiked balls still a stupidly easy way to get money in this version?
[2022-12-07 18:05:05] <%+complexquanta> it's more of a bottom-up simulation, starting with systems of physics and personality and building up a society. rimworld is more top-down, starting with narratives and adding details frugally as necessary.
[2022-12-07 18:05:05] <%akrogon> @imav1ctor Also it has z-levels which is a huge difference
[2022-12-07 18:05:13] <+GShogun> or did they change the value of spiked balls?
[2022-12-07 18:05:13] <Nico_tsb> @seymour47 Dipshit, lmao. Did I hurt your feelings?
[2022-12-07 18:05:17] <+TheGhostlyOnyx> @Nico_tsb you're the one being an asshat and saying it's just a joke
[2022-12-07 18:05:18] <sleepy_knight00> LUL
[2022-12-07 18:05:25] <+iAmKetPain> trading is nice for resource deficits, like wood for a wasteland playthrough
[2022-12-07 18:05:28] <Siilis108> Probably some dead bugs
[2022-12-07 18:05:34] <Nico_tsb> @Nico_tsb Damn, pull out your panties dumbo, wth is going on xD
[2022-12-07 18:05:37] <Siilis108> Luckily dwarves dont poop
[2022-12-07 18:05:42] <friscoborn> mental musing to poo on a stool: pure df
[2022-12-07 18:05:43] <Siilis108> Just smell when they die
[2022-12-07 18:05:45] <cloudsoda> @Nico_tsb dont talk to yourself
[2022-12-07 18:05:46] <+GShogun> if you're mining out dolomite, more than likely there will be iron ore deposits
[2022-12-07 18:05:57] <Bohnenblatt> @imav1ctor Dwarf fortress is more complex. Rimworld is harder. In DF you can build yourself in and nothing can hurt you. In Rimworld you face raids after raids after raids and if you block yourself of they will just dig in.
[2022-12-07 18:05:57] <%+JaneWhitwork> DF Battle Royale when?
[2022-12-07 18:05:59] <+imav1ctor> @imav1ctor okay that's pretty interesting

[2022-12-07 18:06:13] <Nico_tsb> @cloudsoda Imagine upsetting so many people by mentioning Rimworld. Kappa

[2022-12-07 18:06:23] <scootieloo> AA's got a really nice voice, I love how soothing it is. His voice would suit DF very well
[2022-12-07 18:06:23] <+minderbinder141> didnt this game used no to have like no gfx? how tf did anyone play
[2022-12-07 18:06:25] <+GShogun> @swizzter_ eat more pineapple
[2022-12-07 18:06:25] <cloudsoda> @Nico_tsb its twitch, what do you expect LUL
[2022-12-07 18:06:26] <Nico_tsb> @Nico_tsb We're not arguing sweety

[2022-12-07 18:06:29] <+GShogun> @minderbinder141 imagination
[2022-12-07 18:06:36] <Siilis108> Rimworlds great. Dwarf Fortress is great. Played both. Enjoyed both.
[2022-12-07 18:06:36] <+TheGhostlyOnyx> @cloudsoda no you demanded that the streamer play something else not just mentioning rimworld
[2022-12-07 18:06:40] <Nico_tsb> @cloudsoda Thats what I said :D
[2022-12-07 18:06:42] <WellingtonSkellington> @minderbinder141 ascii isn't that bad, and tilesets existed
[2022-12-07 18:06:43] <+GShogun> @minderbinder141 this is a dorf vargDorf , pretty easy to understand (:
[2022-12-07 18:06:44] <TheSovietMoose> I cant wait to try out Dwarf Fortress, such a charming game
[2022-12-07 18:06:48] <WellingtonSkellington> distan16Pog NUMBERS
[2022-12-07 18:06:48] <+Retro42JL> @Bohnenblatt There are certain"Fun" things that DF deals with that RW doesn't though
[2022-12-07 18:06:48] <+pvtbones> need to assign them?
[2022-12-07 18:06:48] <%W33hawk> how long can you go without a militia commander or a sheriff?
[2022-12-07 18:06:49] <%+complexquanta> so DF is "crunchier" and has more emergent storytelling but less hard-coded interesting stuff. the procedural generation can sometimes lead to samey feels; rimworld has a stronger setting and is a better "game" but df is more detailed and in some ways interesting
[2022-12-07 18:06:49] <nagamommy> maybe he wants a throne
[2022-12-07 18:06:51] <+imav1ctor> @Bohnenblatt oh wow really? That's a new way to play, gives you the ability to create a mega society
[2022-12-07 18:06:51] <friscoborn> offices need chair, table is all
[2022-12-07 18:06:51] <Nico_tsb> @cloudsoda It was a joke dude, shut up lmao

[2022-12-07 18:07:09] <Bohnenblatt> @minderbinder141 once you got used to it it played better for a veteran player than playing the steam release as a veteran. Veterans need to learn the controls from the beginning
[2022-12-07 18:07:14] <pieboy321> coffee time!
[2022-12-07 18:07:17] <+GShogun> @complexquanta the game is about as samey or complex as you want to make it, though

[2022-12-07 18:07:49] <+imav1ctor> I saw this game has steam workshop as well, that's what really interested me
[2022-12-07 18:07:51] <+GShogun> if you want to have a super easy and possibly boring experience, you can do that in DF, if you want a hellish and challenging experience, you can also do that
[2022-12-07 18:07:51] <cloudsoda> STOP MENTIONING ME LOL

[2022-12-07 18:08:45] <Bohnenblatt> @minderbinder141 the problem for me is have really deep mustle memory for DF. And now all this mustle memory is pretty much useless

[2022-12-07 18:08:54] <dev_spajus> yes, oxygen and temperature are cellular automata

[2022-12-07 18:09:05] <+GShogun> @Bohnenblatt same, i wish they gave the option for classic controls
[2022-12-07 18:09:13] <dev_spajus> I did play dwarf fortress for 20 minutes while tests were running LUL

[2022-12-07 18:11:58] <Socioscythe> What are the odds of survival in winter?
[2022-12-07 18:12:03] <+GShogun> @Bohnenblatt i'm mulling on getting it or jsut sticking with DF classic

[2022-12-07 18:12:18] <+GShogun> you should have a fine winter if you have a good plump helmet production
[2022-12-07 18:12:18] <nickydeedles> Not much early, first year is forgiving
[2022-12-07 18:12:18] <+Jack9Twitch> do you have a well in the cave Cavern
[2022-12-07 18:12:19] <+Krillxen> make a fishery
[2022-12-07 18:12:20] <+TheGhostlyOnyx> PogChamp time to starve and freeze to death
[2022-12-07 18:12:21] <CleverShadow> Make sure you're converting the plump helmets to food or booze so you get the seeds back quickly. Thats key for keeping the farm going
[2022-12-07 18:12:21] <+LieutenantMilk> you seem fine to me tbh
[2022-12-07 18:12:23] <+iAmKetPain> you might starve but nothing will kill you other than that, might dehydrate, depending on length of winter

[2022-12-07 18:12:35] <+hyperhopper> @ambiguousamphibian make some cage traps or drawbridge to prep for invasion

[2022-12-07 18:12:46] <ChilliDogDave> your biggest threat right now is lack of drinks and food, make a bunch of buckets and barrel and collect water and get a bigger farm
[2022-12-07 18:12:47] <cloudsoda> make a fishery!
[2022-12-07 18:12:48] <cursedwist> water source that won't freeze over?
[2022-12-07 18:12:49] <+imscomobob> make sure you set your seeds up to not be cooked
[2022-12-07 18:12:49] <Bohnenblatt> @GShogun i bought it mainly to give the brothers some money they really deserved
[2022-12-07 18:12:49] <%+seymour47> @GShogun If you know what you're doing in the normal game, it kinda feels like you don't need the steam release.
[2022-12-07 18:12:57] <+MemTheMiner> hunt, plant foods,fish, gather
[2022-12-07 18:12:57] <%akrogon> Designate plants to gather outside
[2022-12-07 18:12:57] <+iAmKetPain> fishery is a workshop
[2022-12-07 18:12:58] <z29v> @ambiguousamphibian disable plump helmets to be cooked in the kitchen tab under labor, brewing plump will produce seeds, infinite plumps
[2022-12-07 18:12:58] <nickydeedles> farm plot, gather plants (area setting outside), hunt animals (crossbow and bolts)
[2022-12-07 18:12:58] <%W33hawk> select a gather plants zone and make it like 4000 tiles and have them pick all the berries and plants in that area
[2022-12-07 18:12:58] <+DragooKnight11> If nothing else, the cats will kill you.
[2022-12-07 18:12:59] <+LieutenantMilk> getting a small tomb set up in case people die, so it doesnt spiral too much
[2022-12-07 18:12:59] <Siilis108> @ambiguousamphibian You need mechanisms (mechanic) and build a lever somewhere and the bridge. Click lever, hook up to bridge :)
[2022-12-07 18:12:59] <sayagainsquid> fishery is a workshop
[2022-12-07 18:13:00] <Socioscythe> @dvorak586 Damn, psycho LUL
[2022-12-07 18:13:00] <ss_skittle> milk/eggs from livestock? :)
[2022-12-07 18:13:00] <+Syluxrox> @CleverShadow do the dwarves automatically harvest the seeds before turning them into wine? Or do you have to specifically tell them to gather them?
[2022-12-07 18:13:00] <CleverShadow> You can designate areas if you want them to fish in a specific area, but you also should make a fishery workshop. @ambiguousamphibian
[2022-12-07 18:13:07] <DatHarass> nah man the cat question was to prevent future problems
[2022-12-07 18:13:09] <DatHarass> tbh
[2022-12-07 18:13:14] <+JTBossHogg> my last play through i have over 600 food, but only 12 dwarves. Kept getting zero migrants every year. fortress wiped out from 3 undead.
[2022-12-07 18:13:15] <Lilstoudey> Heya! Is this the type of game you can learn as you play or do you really need to look at multiple videos to even play it? @ambiguousamphibian
[2022-12-07 18:13:15] <+littlediobolic> Make sure to brew them to get more seeds
[2022-12-07 18:13:17] <leons_sentient_jacket> @ambiguousamphibian bawkStare Bawk Stare
[2022-12-07 18:13:23] <Rexxig> You got a few good dwarfs children to butcher and cook for the winter
[2022-12-07 18:13:25] <Siilis108> DONT COOK THEM
[2022-12-07 18:13:26] <RedBrickAce> is crop rotation a thing?
[2022-12-07 18:13:29] <CleverShadow> @Syluxrox Different things like eating the raw plump helmets, brewing with them or making say biscuits with them will produce seeds
[2022-12-07 18:13:30] <+GShogun> @Bohnenblatt i'd settle with straight up donations, but i'm glad they have a good revenue stream from the steam release
[2022-12-07 18:13:33] <%W33hawk> @ambiguousamphibian how do you get seeds after a grow season? I really struggle with getting the seeds i need.
[2022-12-07 18:13:35] <+hyperhopper> @ambiguousamphibian they nerfed dirt farming in steam, caverns = faster farming now
[2022-12-07 18:13:42] <ChilliDogDave> @ambiguousamphibian the door helped nothing was getting to your crops
[2022-12-07 18:13:43] <just_bees__> yeah, coming from rimworld, cooking up all my plump helmets caused some problems
[2022-12-07 18:13:43] <+iAmKetPain> @ambiguousamphibian if you cook the plump helmets, you'll lose the seeds
[2022-12-07 18:13:49] <+Retro42JL> @W33hawk brewing and eating raw give more seeds
[2022-12-07 18:13:50] <+GShogun> @seymour47 yeah, plus i can get my own tilesets and other customizations from the community if i need
[2022-12-07 18:13:52] <Bohnenblatt> @GShogun one thing i dont like about the steam release is that farms dont show planted plants
[2022-12-07 18:13:58] <%+seymour47> @GShogun Yea
[2022-12-07 18:14:00] <+GShogun> @Bohnenblatt oh, that's weird

[2022-12-07 18:14:23] <Mananskatar> Ypu can harvest plants from the surface
[2022-12-07 18:14:25] <%kosine> I do like that rimworld has warnings like "tattered clothes, hunter lacks ranged weapon, and low food". It seems like DF doesn't really offer things like that.
[2022-12-07 18:14:31] <%W33hawk> @W33hawk thanks!
[2022-12-07 18:14:51] <CleverShadow> Has it been winter yet? Does the water freeze here?
[2022-12-07 18:15:03] <sayagainsquid> I heard butcheries are better outside? can the vets correct me if I'm wrong?
[2022-12-07 18:15:03] <+GShogun> @kosine DF is more macro focused, you dont have to worry about tattered clothing if you have a stable clothing industry
[2022-12-07 18:15:11] <Bohnenblatt> @kosine I always say Dwarf fortress is harder to learn but Rimworld is a harder game
[2022-12-07 18:15:11] <+imscomobob> @CleverShadow it does
[2022-12-07 18:15:12] <+two_capybaras> poultry is also a good food source quite easy to set up

[2022-12-07 18:15:12] <+GShogun> @kosine because dwarfs will always pick up new clothes when evailable
