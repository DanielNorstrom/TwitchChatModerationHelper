[2022-12-16 22:01:25] <rameesspit> Randy should be 2 days cause of what k did but Vinny and ramee got the most times,
[2022-12-16 22:01:26] <+Silvia240> think ramee got 5 on a plea deal, everyone else has like 2 or 3
[2022-12-16 22:01:45] <Diatom86> aren't those sentences for the raid stuff?

[2022-12-16 22:02:24] <rameesspit> @loksmiff was for weapon manufacturer and drug trafficking plus that’s with a plea deal, if they take it to court it would be a minimum of 10 but they where being told they would be lifers until 4.0
[2022-12-16 22:02:49] <+monkeyshash> did they ever say when they'll start releasing s++ cars for boost

[2022-12-16 22:04:26] <+55Hoes> 5 days of Cops incoming
[2022-12-16 22:04:28] <rameesspit> @yoobones actually they where pretty close bass had tracked Ks calls from kidnapping Mickey there’s a clip on YouTube about it when he didn’t know there’s an ooc reason behind it
[2022-12-16 22:04:30] <%+th3_n0torious> how do lifers get content?
[2022-12-16 22:04:30] <%+redfoxlive24> @flexmasterzach Also IMO streamers would be smart to expand out of RP if they want to stream into the future....never know when RP will die
[2022-12-16 22:04:32] <%+canve123> baas all about that money
[2022-12-16 22:04:33] <mutilatedmule> This is where misinformation is spread it was not an event it was going to get raided regardless as bass had been investigating it he was given a time on when to do it because it was being removed said by koil himself btw
[2022-12-16 22:04:38] <%hem1so> LOL
[2022-12-16 22:04:38] <@%summit1g> Wait the boys get full consequences for that gallery event?

[2022-12-16 22:04:44] <%+Hylidian> basically, CG did it for content, and cops had to flex so they look good to their viewers, but again what's new
