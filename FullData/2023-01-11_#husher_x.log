[2023-01-11 08:29:29] <DoubleLightning> House Cats can literally train themselves
[2023-01-11 08:29:29] <AutumnTeien> To say nothing about our ability to sweat. Most animals need to stop and pant to regain energy, but humans can basically run forever. Underrated human ability, if you ask me.

[2023-01-11 09:35:53] <White_Blaze> cuddles are amazing ebcause there's so many ways to do them despite the concept being so simple. you can be wholesome, or lewd, or a mix of other things in between. so i still dont understand why some folks dont like cuddles.
