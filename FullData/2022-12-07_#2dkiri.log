[2022-12-07 17:35:00] <%+brewhogg> Ah, I didn't see that dorm

[2022-12-07 17:35:20] <%+brewhogg> Boy, that was a jinx moment

[2022-12-07 17:36:30] <+SinisterOctopus> How do you get that happiness indicator at the top of the screen?
[2022-12-07 17:36:35] <Solshinery> Really wish they let us save custom stockpile configs for later.

[2022-12-07 17:37:01] <%+brewhogg> @SinisterOctopus
[2022-12-07 17:37:02] <+SinisterOctopus> Oh snap
[2022-12-07 17:37:12] <Solshinery> You can assign one in the nobility screen, accessed by 'n'
[2022-12-07 17:37:25] <Graknorke> you can grow farms on any kind of dirt, it's a bit silly how permissive the game is. sand or loam or clay all work
[2022-12-07 17:37:34] <Graknorke> though i think there's now a penalty for bad soil
[2022-12-07 17:37:39] <Solshinery> Oh is it just there without a bookkeeper?
[2022-12-07 17:37:49] <Solshinery> I stand corrected.

[2022-12-07 17:38:04] <+SinisterOctopus> Yeah, I have a bookeeper, no hapiness indicator
[2022-12-07 17:38:06] <Solshinery> Let me investigate for you @SinisterOctopus
[2022-12-07 17:38:16] <@%2DKiriBot> We're making a snowflake garland this Holiday season. Sub, gift at least 1 sub, cheer at least 500 Bits, or tip at least €5 to get your snowflake in the garland kiriSee
[2022-12-07 17:38:22] <+Aryaltel> Happiness/Stock bar on top is a resolution issue.   There's a good guide in Steam Discussions on video settings for everything to show.
[2022-12-07 17:38:27] <Solshinery> Ahhhh.
[2022-12-07 17:38:31] <+SinisterOctopus> @Solshinery I appreciate that
[2022-12-07 17:38:36] <Solshinery> They really need to address that.
[2022-12-07 17:39:02] <+SinisterOctopus> Oh, weird. I'm playing DF on my primary laptop screen, let me move it to an external screen
[2022-12-07 17:39:20] <%+brewhogg> @Solshinery Seriously. Luckily I've been playing on a wide screen
[2022-12-07 17:39:23] <%Breiair> apparantly there's issues with resolutions over 1920*1080
[2022-12-07 17:39:24] <+Aryaltel> Yeah, it's a pain.   But it's a resolution issue, not a 'game' bug, so that should be fairly quick to fix for 'em.   Fingers crossed.

[2022-12-07 17:39:37] <%+brewhogg> @Breiair Wait, resolutions larger than that?
[2022-12-07 17:39:41] <Solshinery> Well, UI is never as simple as it seems.
[2022-12-07 17:39:45] <%+brewhogg> I'm playing with a wider res
[2022-12-07 17:39:46] <%Breiair> @Breiair ye

[2022-12-07 17:40:29] <octeris> @Breiair my monitor is 3440x1440 ultrawide do you know if there a problems with that aspect ratio?

[2022-12-07 17:40:50] <%Breiair> @Breiair idk what limits it has, I just saw a post in a discord about it, but that was also in reference of certain CTD issues
[2022-12-07 17:41:03] <%legofisch> hej hej
[2022-12-07 17:41:14] <+SinisterOctopus> Um, Im in 3840 x 2160 still not there

[2022-12-07 17:41:16] <%legofisch> @Breiair ah well, there is always windowed I guess :D

[2022-12-07 17:41:31] <@%2DKiriBot> Did you see it too? kiriChair It's MOVING!! kiriGasp
[2022-12-07 17:41:31] <%Breiair> @Breiair don't think it's purely based on monitor size, as long as you keep the game windowed and set to a 1920*1080 resolution
[2022-12-07 17:41:33] <%+brewhogg> @SinisterOctopus So, it's missing those happiness indicators at the top?
[2022-12-07 17:41:37] <%+brewhogg> I have the top bar
[2022-12-07 17:41:45] <+SinisterOctopus> Yeah
[2022-12-07 17:41:53] <Solshinery> Yeah monitor size is not the same as resolution, I have a fairly small monitor that is still 1080p.
[2022-12-07 17:41:53] <%+brewhogg> I'm on 2560x1080
[2022-12-07 17:41:58] VIEWERS: 513
[2022-12-07 17:42:09] <Solshinery> I'm not finding that guide for resolutions on steam, if someone would like to provide it instead.

[2022-12-07 17:43:08] <octeris> is this the first time you have played Dwarf Fortress?
[2022-12-07 17:43:22] <!%Dome007> I love that sound kiriLove
[2022-12-07 17:43:33] <Solshinery> Right... so 1080p seems like the sweet spot for the GUI currently.
[2022-12-07 17:43:47] <+SinisterOctopus> I'm going to check Reddit
[2022-12-07 17:43:59] VIEWERS: 513
[2022-12-07 17:44:31] <Solshinery> @SinisterOctopus under video settings in-game there's a setting for GUI scaling if not everything fits, perhaps changing that to something smaller than 400 would help?
[2022-12-07 17:44:31] <%Breiair> @Solshinery https://steamcommunity.com/app/975370/discussions/0/3716062978729823946/?ctp=3#c3716062978730335511 should be a dev comment on it
[2022-12-07 17:44:41] <Solshinery> also see above ^ @SinisterOctopus
[2022-12-07 17:44:42] <octeris> I've always wanted to learn the game but never persevered through the ASCII version or setting up tiles. With the Steam GUI update I'm going to try again.
[2022-12-07 17:44:51] <Solshinery> thanks @Breiair
[2022-12-07 17:44:58] <%Breiair> np HypeSeemsGood
[2022-12-07 17:45:02] <+chaostrojan> agree on resolution, can see resources now :)

[2022-12-07 17:45:12] <+astrosteve> I find it relaxing, but that's because I don't care what happens to my fort, I can always make another.
[2022-12-07 17:45:14] <%wombatwhole> you pay more for down scaling
[2022-12-07 17:45:18] <Solshinery> @octeris Don't hesitate to ask veteran players for help if you need it, the community is very keen to help new players :)
[2022-12-07 17:45:33] <%RonanSoleste> Graphics!! :D
[2022-12-07 17:45:41] <Solshinery> @wombatwhole Well, maybe, but as a stopgap solution?

[2022-12-07 17:45:45] <%Breiair> @Solshinery that one was specifically about crashing but I also saw some posts mention it fixing other issues

[2022-12-07 17:46:29] <Solshinery> There was always mouse support, it was just incomplete and not very polished.

[2022-12-07 17:47:17] <%legofisch> With all that talk about resolutions, I have to praise the good old gem that is Settlers 2 kiriCool  That game needs DosBox to run nowadays, but deals with 1080p just fine. Which is amazing considering it is from the early 90s

[2022-12-07 17:48:00] <%legofisch> @RonanSoleste yeah. I can seal with the art, and there is some tilesets for that, but the lack of mouse support was too much for me

[2022-12-07 17:48:35] <DiamondDestructe> ya, i know, kinda hate that zoom order. coulndd't change it cryptD
[2022-12-07 17:48:36] <%Solshinery> I dislike the control scheme for zooming/moving z-levels, and I hate that you can't change it.
[2022-12-07 17:48:41] <%brewhogg> Ctrl-Mouse scroll zooms. I didn't see if you were doing that
[2022-12-07 17:48:51] <+astrosteve> yeah. you have to hold Control to zoom
[2022-12-07 17:48:56] <DiamondDestructe> there might be option to change hard config change it but don't know
[2022-12-07 17:49:17] <%+inakleinbottle> keep on digging Kiri!

[2022-12-07 17:49:34] <%legofisch> ah mouse wheel for z levels is nice
[2022-12-07 17:49:35] <+astrosteve> I also don't like the wheel is backwards for z-level changing.

[2022-12-07 17:50:14] <octeris> if a game has z-levels it's definitely my kind of game LUL
[2022-12-07 17:50:18] <%legofisch> can you switch it? ctrl +wheel for z and just mousewheel for zoom
[2022-12-07 17:50:19] <%Solshinery> Thank you so much.
[2022-12-07 17:50:34] <TactfulKook> I am starting to learn the new keybinds for build-menu, which is immensely helpful
[2022-12-07 17:50:52] <%brewhogg> I haven't even looked at that difficulty tab yet.
[2022-12-07 17:51:15] <%Solshinery> It's so unintuitive. If I'm scrolling up I'm scrolling -toward- what I'm looking at. That's how it is in literally every other game. LUL

[2022-12-07 17:52:20] <Starmage> bird audio or so
[2022-12-07 17:52:38] <+Netriak> @octeris Depends on your fortress location. In a safe place, there is no real threat for quite a while
[2022-12-07 17:52:42] <TactfulKook> @octeris Build drawbridge with lever and a moat and you can just hole up
[2022-12-07 17:52:47] <%Solshinery> @octeris depends on your embark. You can embark in a peaceful area away from hostile factions, and you might be quite a while before getting attacked. You also get more attention depending on how much wealth you accumulate.

[2022-12-07 17:53:10] <DiamondDestructe> it depens on your surrounds, if you in a safe spot, good change it will take a long time for bad ies
[2022-12-07 17:53:29] <%brewhogg> There's a ton of reddit posts on the tutorial putting them in a location that killed everyone off in a manner of seconds/minutes
[2022-12-07 17:53:43] <Graknorke> @octeris attacks are dependent on who you're near. if you embark near a necromancer tower then defence is VERY important. if you're on an isolated island you don't need to bother with much of anything
[2022-12-07 17:53:52] <%Solshinery> @Solshinery What software is that?

[2022-12-07 17:54:14] <%Solshinery> The simple answer is 'it depends, fortress defense is a little complicated'
[2022-12-07 17:54:16] <%legofisch> @brewhogg I played Kenshi, I can probably deal with that frustration :D
[2022-12-07 17:54:31] <%Solshinery> But there's loads of guides about it online, they're just for the classic version, which for the most part is still the same game.

[2022-12-07 18:13:23] <Graknorke> grazing animals just eat grass you're good
[2022-12-07 18:13:40] <TheCalamari> isnt this game supposed to be mega complex
[2022-12-07 18:13:42] <%Oskatatv2> unless it's snowy
[2022-12-07 18:13:54] <+Bean03> @Graknorke Other than common sense is there a way to know which are grazing and which need to be fed? How do you feed them if they aren't grazing?

[2022-12-07 18:14:32] <%Oskatatv2> most of the complexity is kind of buried, you don't really have to interact with the worst of it
[2022-12-07 18:14:45] <AquaTsar17> If animals don't graze, they don't need to be fed
[2022-12-07 18:15:02] <%Oskatatv2> otherwise it's always mostly suffered from a bit of a UI problem
[2022-12-07 18:15:11] <+Bean03> Well that makes it easy. Thanks!
[2022-12-07 18:15:37] <mr_snypes> I started a fort yesterday, this is way ahead of what I managed to figure out LUL
