[2023-01-04 09:42:27] <%SAXEL34> I guess regular gasoline, diesel car have a bad history aswell. But in 2023 there should be anything as child labour. And especially in such an industry so dangerous as these mines
[2023-01-04 09:42:30] <17twentynine> an ev produces more carbon emissions during it's manufacturing than a petrol car does over it's entire lifetime, so whats the point?
