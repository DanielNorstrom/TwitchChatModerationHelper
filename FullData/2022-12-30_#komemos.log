[2022-12-30 11:20:22] <%+Hannibal_78> @komemos I struggled with VV set Crit dmg circlet as i could get the first on set after 5 month, almost six. No good onset Anemo goblet. So before i got Midsplitter i went for Blackcliff sword as the crit dmg substats was also low. So it helped a lot to balance the crit ratio. In this scenario i consider a good investment.

Talking about ANY other leaks directly or indirectly in twitch chat will get your message deleted and if you continue to do so you'll get timed out , because 1. he likes to surprised by every new content 2. He doesnt care.

[2022-12-30 11:51:49] <%+Hannibal_78> @komemos if they introduce more extra level maybe they could just decrease with every level the matterial what we need to farm for Characters and weapons and maybe talents, but only the material what we get from killing mobs, not from Domains with Resins.  That would be a good think in my opinion

[2022-12-30 13:13:40] <%Avatarinator_> @pjamezzz Her skill procs the seeds very reliably and consistently, also the healing is a nice bonus
[2022-12-30 13:13:41] <%HackerManEz> @pjamezzz bc she heals and applies constant electro and doesnt just apply it to enemy but everything around her
[2022-12-30 13:13:50] <%syaz167> @pjamezzz Because she can reliably trigger the cores without relying on her Burst (so you can stack as much EM as possible without needing any ER on her)

[2022-12-30 14:20:39] <Popabogdan> The good thing about Raiden weapon is that it frees up The Catch for XL
[2022-12-30 14:20:53] <!%peepogaclap> @QuietusGale for me it's about 300k FeelsOkayMan

[2022-12-30 14:21:05] <ducktrophy> Best thing about raiden weapon is that it fits her aesthetic and she deserves your love
[2022-12-30 14:21:08] <%QuietusGale> @peepogaclap thats not normal
[2022-12-30 14:21:11] <%QuietusGale> Smoge
[2022-12-30 14:21:11] <ShaiMeerKat> so just go for the catch, and go for c2

[2022-12-30 14:22:14] <%QuietusGale> catHug
[2022-12-30 14:22:14] <zhrrix> does sara burst levels increase her buffing powers or just her personal damage?
[2022-12-30 14:22:24] <ducktrophy> If you work for the ammount of time it takes to get catch you can just buy primos for Engulfing 5Head but you have to work FeelsBadMan Catch it is FeelsGoodMan
[2022-12-30 14:22:30] <popalot12345> if you wishes for only one weapon you can try it for shits and giggles
[2022-12-30 14:22:31] <rorothewolf> @zhrrix her E level increases her buff
[2022-12-30 14:22:34] <!%peepogaclap> @Komemos 40% OMEGADANCEBUTFAST
[2022-12-30 14:22:41] <+rakujiix> @zhrrix bigger buff too
[2022-12-30 14:22:44] <dj_skillex> it worked by chance and the behaviour was reinforced since it worked, but its all probabilistic in the end YEP

[2022-12-30 14:22:48] <+DryDorito> Englufing gives the atk buff thats whats so huge abt it

[2022-12-30 14:23:58] <+DryDorito> my only reason to go for engulfing would be so my xiangling can use catch KEKW
[2022-12-30 14:23:58] <rorothewolf> engulfing feeds into her kit and the attack gain is insane
[2022-12-30 14:24:05] <zhrrix> @zhrrix i use ER sands
[2022-12-30 14:24:27] <%neter0san> 240 is enough with engulfing right kome?
[2022-12-30 14:24:35] <ducktrophy> with 280 ER and ER sands u probably can switch to ATK sands
