[2022-12-11 00:20:52] <%polig> depends on class
[2022-12-11 00:20:58] <%polig> if lvl 1 class engr

[2022-12-11 00:21:06] <%+kiite1991> yeahsave lots of peons
[2022-12-11 00:21:09] <%+Arwya0203> on lvl 1 class engr you dont need 9/7
[2022-12-11 00:21:10] <%+DennySommer> lol just two tapped bard to 1495

[2022-12-11 00:22:41] <weaponz_xshotz> ancient is stupidly expensive
[2022-12-11 00:22:44] <%polig> but with ancient you get 5x3 plus lvl 2
[2022-12-11 00:22:45] <%+Arwya0203> @TheJuan i konw
[2022-12-11 00:22:52] <%polig> if you have 9/7
[2022-12-11 00:22:54] <!%micahlee83> i can't even afford relic yet KEKW
[2022-12-11 00:22:56] <%+Arwya0203> @polig you need 9/7 for that
[2022-12-11 00:22:58] <%SyzzAMV> good ancient gear won't go down in price until months after brel hard release
[2022-12-11 00:23:07] <%+Arwya0203> and then the lvl 2 engr MUST be the 7 on the stone
[2022-12-11 00:23:28] <+TheJuan> imagin buying all your accesories all over again
[2022-12-11 00:23:34] <%+Arwya0203> just get lucky and drop it KEKW

[2022-12-11 00:25:01] <%+Arwya0203> @polig you get insane amount of stamina
[2022-12-11 00:25:08] <%+Arwya0203> and in ancient rocks you have 4 levels
[2022-12-11 00:25:11] <%+Arwya0203> each levels gives more hp
[2022-12-11 00:25:18] <%+Arwya0203> but for that we need elgacia
[2022-12-11 00:25:27] <%+Arwya0203> aswell as lvl 3 set bonus
