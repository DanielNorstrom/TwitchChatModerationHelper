[2022-12-05 22:45:21] <!%+AirahsELL> last gym, then elite four, possibly rayquaza first

[2022-12-05 22:45:33] <!%Fuzzgotgames> just to make sure

[2022-12-05 22:45:34] <David_Lemieux> yeah, there
[2022-12-05 22:45:37] <@%DrGoodStrats> The small isalnd to the far east middle

[2022-12-05 22:45:51] <trublu1003> and you NEED waterfall to get there
[2022-12-05 22:45:54] <JodanTheHero> Makes sense, it's the island BY ITSELF AT THE EDGE OF THE MAP.
[2022-12-05 22:45:58] <@%$BlackCharcz> but there's victory road in the way, same as in fire red
[2022-12-05 22:46:09] <@%owlishnick> What you NEED is to go to the bathroom
[2022-12-05 22:46:12] <@%$BlackCharcz> yep
[2022-12-05 22:46:26] <JodanTheHero> As most final areas in games be. It's by itself at the far edge of the map.
[2022-12-05 22:46:27] <!%+AirahsELL> catch him before
[2022-12-05 22:46:29] <JodanTheHero> Bless you?
[2022-12-05 22:46:30] <%Sotetsu> Bless you
[2022-12-05 22:46:48] <JodanTheHero> Can't wait to see what Rayquaza looks like.
[2022-12-05 22:46:50] <!%+AirahsELL> he'll be lvl70 but should be a fun fight
[2022-12-05 22:46:53] <%Wolffang_Amadeus_Mozart> I don't understand why Oli is tourture her blader so much
[2022-12-05 22:46:53] <%GinTamashiVT> It wouldn't be bad to have a legendary, but at this point, I'd say it's up to you and how much more time you want to put into Emerald

[2022-12-05 22:47:53] <@%$BlackCharcz> Rayuqaza and Outrage pretty much carried me through the league. Might be worth it. And it will probably be the only legend Oli gets to catch
[2022-12-05 22:47:56] <Kanashii_Kuroneko> Oli so vtubular she sneezes and gets lost?
[2022-12-05 22:48:03] <@%$BlackCharcz> we do want to see her malding at least a bit, right?
[2022-12-05 22:48:07] <!%+AirahsELL> maybe she could do a postgame legend hunt tomorrow with chat to get the regis and the 3 big boys
[2022-12-05 22:48:24] <JodanTheHero> "vTubular". I LOVE THAT.
[2022-12-05 22:48:28] <@%DrGoodStrats> Isn't Raymond at level 75 when you find it?

[2022-12-05 22:49:33] <!%+AirahsELL> yeah if uoure not intending on a legend hunt it might be best to burn your master ball on rayquaza
[2022-12-05 22:49:36] <!%Fuzzgotgames> Fighting, Rock, Steel, Fire
[2022-12-05 22:49:42] <+KRX50> Despite the ice puzzle, this is a Water Gym

[2022-12-05 22:50:48] <trublu1003> Also note that all the gym trainers in this gym are all female. Juan is quite the chad
[2022-12-05 22:50:49] <JodanTheHero> Skarmory and Pikachu may be the play here then.
[2022-12-05 22:50:57] <!%+AirahsELL> Pikachu, or Gardevoir (if you want to teach it Thunderbolt with a TM)
[2022-12-05 22:50:58] <%Wolffang_Amadeus_Mozart> you can also learn thunder to gardevoir

[2022-12-05 22:51:18] <+KRX50> Gardevoir probably has higher stats
[2022-12-05 22:51:40] <@%owlishnick> Not thunder, go with thunderbolt
[2022-12-05 22:51:55] <!%+AirahsELL> well gardevoir cant learn thunder anyway iirc. just thunderbolt
[2022-12-05 22:51:57] <%Wolffang_Amadeus_Mozart> she don't have thunderbolt

[2022-12-05 23:08:51] <michaeljande> Poll
[2022-12-05 23:08:52] <%GinTamashiVT> I don't mind either way
[2022-12-05 23:08:53] <+kenTacoHut_> YES
[2022-12-05 23:08:54] <%+Abstract_Endurance> lets see it
[2022-12-05 23:08:54] <%Wolffang_Amadeus_Mozart> that is probably a stream it self

[2022-12-05 23:08:59] <%Hentaiwatcher_> wanna see you kick more butt
[2022-12-05 23:08:59] <!%Fuzzgotgames> I think you'll see some new pokemon on victory road
[2022-12-05 23:09:07] <!%Fuzzgotgames> the trainers there usually have endgame pokemon
[2022-12-05 23:09:13] VIEWERS: 316
[2022-12-05 23:09:14] <@%owlishnick> You should be able to fit Victory Road and E4 in one stream
[2022-12-05 23:09:20] <JoesGuy> We need new waifus. MVGame
[2022-12-05 23:09:45] <%gorillafinn> @joesguy heathen, how is tummyvoir not enough for you!
[2022-12-05 23:09:45] <!%Fuzzgotgames> at this rate, you should be done in the length of a normal stream with what you have planned
[2022-12-05 23:09:48] <%Wolffang_Amadeus_Mozart> If you have Ray it sould be easy
[2022-12-05 23:10:08] <Flamesabre14> wayqwaza
[2022-12-05 23:10:08] <CptTinko> E4 has always a champion on top aicBAKA
[2022-12-05 23:10:08] <JoesGuy> @gorillafinn I wanna catch 'em all. ;)
[2022-12-05 23:10:12] <%GinTamashiVT> I think it shouldn't be too hard for one stream. Then you can choose if you want to try and hunt down the other legendaries or not
[2022-12-05 23:10:26] <!%+AirahsELL> you could grab Rayquaza today and then head to victory road and E4 tomorrow, and then cap Groudon and Kyogre right after
[2022-12-05 23:10:48] <%Wolffang_Amadeus_Mozart> It's not the elite four, it's the Elite five with the most Elite on the top
[2022-12-05 23:10:51] <!%Fuzzgotgames> The last time you did a champion battle you did it all on your own. Think you'll do that again?
[2022-12-05 23:10:56] <$Taciturn_Tactics> Isn't victory road just a normal road for you Oli? Given that you always win
[2022-12-05 23:10:57] <trublu1003> wrong

[2022-12-05 23:24:09] <%Wolffang_Amadeus_Mozart> save state every step
[2022-12-05 23:24:09] <!%Fuzzgotgames> Gotta go ham on holding the direction down. Dont turn
[2022-12-05 23:24:11] <lanturn1> need more speed
[2022-12-05 23:24:13] <%coco19067> Go sonic fast!

[2022-12-05 23:24:21] <%$Aiakos_VEVO> you gotta build up speed
[2022-12-05 23:24:22] <Flamesabre14> it takes a tile to build up speed
[2022-12-05 23:24:26] <%Sotetsu> DO a fast turn so you don't lose speed.
[2022-12-05 23:24:27] <!%Fuzzgotgames> and you need enough room to build up speed
[2022-12-05 23:24:30] <%Wolffang_Amadeus_Mozart> I LOVE VIDEO GAMES! can we have a counter for that
[2022-12-05 23:24:37] <!%+AirahsELL> yeah thats gothic lolita fashion. very much looking like victorian era clothing but with a modern twist
[2022-12-05 23:24:41] <trublu1003> that's hot??
[2022-12-05 23:24:48] <%Sotetsu> Oh good, your cheerleader outfit still fits? olivia50Oho
[2022-12-05 23:24:49] <%Hentaiwatcher_> gotta zoomies
[2022-12-05 23:25:01] <%GinTamashiVT> basically, you can't stop at that little respite. it's a trap
[2022-12-05 23:25:06] <%Wolffang_Amadeus_Mozart> remember to save state
[2022-12-05 23:25:08] <%Sotetsu> You gotta do a fast turn
[2022-12-05 23:25:15] <%Wolffang_Amadeus_Mozart> cheating is key
[2022-12-05 23:25:17] <!%+AirahsELL> save state?
[2022-12-05 23:25:18] <%Wolffang_Amadeus_Mozart> you can
[2022-12-05 23:25:18] <@%Athagorn> I think you can.
[2022-12-05 23:25:20] <%$Aiakos_VEVO> you gott a turn while moving
[2022-12-05 23:25:20] <%GinTamashiVT> Just have to keep the momentum
[2022-12-05 23:25:21] <!%xman1712> Can't you turn while maintaining speed?
[2022-12-05 23:25:21] <@%arcanumghost> oh yeah, good advice - save states will make this much easier

[2022-12-05 23:34:16] <!%xman1712> Pikachu maybe?

[2022-12-05 23:34:18] <!%Fuzzgotgames> I mean I know pikachu is really carrying us
[2022-12-05 23:34:20] <%Wolffang_Amadeus_Mozart> but did the quest line
[2022-12-05 23:34:23] <%coco19067> The lowest level has gotta go.
[2022-12-05 23:34:23] <@%DrGoodStrats> It kind of doesn't amtter. Ray is so much stronger you don't really need to think about coverage
[2022-12-05 23:34:26] <!%+AirahsELL> or Pikachu
[2022-12-05 23:34:28] <Fryman80s> I'd dump the Skarmory
[2022-12-05 23:34:31] <%Wolffang_Amadeus_Mozart> pikachu

[2022-12-05 23:34:43] <Fryman80s> Skarmory is going to be redundant
[2022-12-05 23:34:45] <P1ZZAC4T> I am doing good, I am back home from work
[2022-12-05 23:34:46] <SassySlayer69> lombre
[2022-12-05 23:34:48] <JoesGuy> Lombre is just there
[2022-12-05 23:34:50] <%Wolffang_Amadeus_Mozart> Ray is fly dragon
[2022-12-05 23:34:54] <SassySlayer69> give lombre the boot
[2022-12-05 23:34:55] <Fryman80s> Lombre is also redundant though
[2022-12-05 23:35:01] <%Sotetsu> Get rid of Lombre and put Torkoal in.
[2022-12-05 23:35:11] <%Furudehan> Get rid of your other dragon?
[2022-12-05 23:35:14] <Fryman80s> Wait, you didn't put surf on your Swampert?
[2022-12-05 23:35:14] <%Wolffang_Amadeus_Mozart> you need waterfall to
[2022-12-05 23:35:15] <PC_4S_H> Rayquaza isn't a very good Pokemon. You should probably release it

[2022-12-05 23:35:39] <%+Abstract_Endurance> counterpoint, have TWO dragons
[2022-12-05 23:35:42] <%Furudehan> Wow terrible moveset
[2022-12-05 23:35:42] <Fryman80s> Quick attack on steroids
[2022-12-05 23:35:46] <!%Fuzzgotgames> Extremespeed is like quick attack but faster and useful
[2022-12-05 23:35:53] <CptTinko> extremely depressed Sadge
[2022-12-05 23:36:02] <JoesGuy> Fast AND powerful. So it's the best move then.
[2022-12-05 23:36:02] <!%+AirahsELL> it knows fly by default? skarmory gotta go
[2022-12-05 23:36:06] <%GinTamashiVT> Those are actually some solid movrs...
[2022-12-05 23:36:06] <%Sotetsu> If I were a pokemon, my moves would be Rest, Outrage, and Struggle.
[2022-12-05 23:36:08] <%Wolffang_Amadeus_Mozart> that attack always goes first, don't know if it works for protect
[2022-12-05 23:36:09] <Fryman80s> Replace Rest with Dragon Claw and you look good
