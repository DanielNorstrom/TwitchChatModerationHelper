[2022-12-14 16:46:22] <Temporal_Paradox> they probably started at the bottom and worked their way up
[2022-12-14 16:46:24] <%PigWithoutProtection> they were graves, and used a lot of ropes and pulleys

[2022-12-14 16:57:35] <MagikBased> They're much cheaper at walmart and they will put it in for free.
[2022-12-14 16:57:37] <AllHailKingJulian> I've had dead battery situations too many times in the past.  Thank goodness for roadside assistance coverage.  Hope everything gets resolved soon prayersHeadpat

[2022-12-14 17:01:17] <!AirahsELL> philadelphia has decent subway transit just because of how the city is built. its just that the subways are always very dirty.
[2022-12-14 17:01:23] <%+aathray> the problem is car centric infrastructure, public transit literally doesn't exist

[2022-12-14 17:52:43] <%ArcReaper_21> We told you last stream. Paying friends too be with you will only give you friends until you lose your money.

[2022-12-14 17:57:30] <Temporal_Paradox> tomes save inventory space
[2022-12-14 17:57:31] <Komfigaming> you can keep filling it up
[2022-12-14 17:57:36] <Komfigaming> you only need 1
[2022-12-14 17:57:39] <%TalkingObject> Don't get mad, get glad
[2022-12-14 17:57:44] <Carveca> 1 in the portal and 3 in the ident
[2022-12-14 17:57:48] <WirtsThirdLeg> so, Diablo 2: Load actually has better graphics than what you're looking at, the "legacy" setting sets them back to when Diablo was originally released, not after it updated with patches and the expansion
[2022-12-14 17:57:49] <GuyMcGuy> ctrl-right click to fill the book i think
[2022-12-14 17:57:49] <ChibiDeviChaosCH> it came with 1 or 2
[2022-12-14 17:57:52] <%PigWithoutProtection> the book is like, a jar for scrolls. you dont lose it and it takes a lot less inventory space than 20 scrolls
[2022-12-14 17:57:56] <Proteus42> @TalkingObject I know that commercial. LUL

[2022-12-14 18:00:03] <%Leon27607> You really don't want to equip items after you die because diablo only saves items from your most recent corpse

[2022-12-14 18:00:27] <%Leon27607> so if you die now, you will lose the items from your first corpse
[2022-12-14 18:00:27] <$Frankthetank30> Oh no! It's Oli's fans chasing her like; LUL
[2022-12-14 18:00:33] <%PigWithoutProtection> yeah items on the ground despawn
[2022-12-14 18:00:41] <GuyMcGuy> @Leon27607 only if you quit the game session
[2022-12-14 18:00:42] <WirtsThirdLeg> so if you die again you lose everything
[2022-12-14 18:00:50] <ChibiDeviChaosCH> use atown portal so you have a way back in case you die
[2022-12-14 18:00:52] <GuyMcGuy> i think you can have like 8? corpses total saved
[2022-12-14 18:00:55] <+JayBusch> Just don‚Äôt die again

[2022-12-14 18:01:28] <Redamaford> You might want to drop a town portal HERE at the enterance, so if you die again you can just instantly zip back.
[2022-12-14 18:01:29] <ChibiDeviChaosCH> always drop a portal jus to be save
[2022-12-14 18:01:30] <CanofUniGear> safer to unequip everything before pickin up your corpse
[2022-12-14 18:01:30] <Komfigaming> this isn't even a hardcore character

[2022-12-14 18:08:33] <!%AirahsELL> This is "Normal" difficulty which is the easiest difficutly in the game. harder modes unlock after you beat the game

[2022-12-14 18:08:51] <Chaosheal> diablo 2 is the dark souls of souls-like
[2022-12-14 18:08:54] <NagasakiMH> guess what, diablo2 also got an own hardcore mode
[2022-12-14 18:08:54] <Chaosheal> or something

[2022-12-14 18:09:00] <+Shadowape34> you had potions in your inventory but you didn't put them in your potion bar
[2022-12-14 18:09:01] <NekripTor> this is way easier than DS tbh
[2022-12-14 18:09:05] <!%AirahsELL> its called the salty runback.

[2022-12-14 18:09:43] <NekripTor> you can always explore more before entering that cave
[2022-12-14 18:09:45] <InaneDugong> playing it in retro mode KEKW
[2022-12-14 18:09:47] <+JayBusch> You should kill basic enemies more, grind up like crazy
[2022-12-14 18:09:48] <!%AirahsELL> you dont have to close the program, just go back to character select
[2022-12-14 18:09:49] <NekripTor> fights enemies at your llvl

[2022-12-14 18:09:55] <Temporal_Paradox> put on clothes, use your skills. barbarians don't use all that much mana, health pots are more important

[2022-12-14 18:10:02] <WirtsThirdLeg> she reequipped different items and will lose all her gear if she leaves game LUL
[2022-12-14 18:10:02] <%PigWithoutProtection> not killing enough to get better loot/xp
[2022-12-14 18:10:08] <NagasakiMH> you shouldnt pull giga-groups
[2022-12-14 18:10:11] <GuyMcGuy> making a portal before running into the people that killed you, and running back after you pick up body SeemsGood
[2022-12-14 18:10:12] <%Sotetsu> Oli has too much skill, this game can't handle it.
[2022-12-14 18:10:14] <Natal_KOG> tobsNotes
[2022-12-14 18:10:21] <+JayBusch> Barb is easy, you need to kill more enemies
[2022-12-14 18:10:24] <%Leon27607> Barb is very gear dependent late game if you make it there
[2022-12-14 18:10:25] <newtonia09> stock up on ALOT of potions
[2022-12-14 18:10:28] <%Lillowh> You need: to deal more damage. You need to stop: taking damage. olivia50Pat
[2022-12-14 18:10:32] <GuyMcGuy> @WirtsThirdLeg except she grabbed the body with invenotyr space
[2022-12-14 18:10:32] <%kirby23590> the8bitXD
[2022-12-14 18:10:33] <Proteus42> correction. TP is Town Portal from teleport scroll.
[2022-12-14 18:10:33] <%Sotetsu> That's smart, Guy
[2022-12-14 18:10:46] <%gorillafinn> next time dont die
[2022-12-14 18:10:47] <redmanticore> well, 1st we can learn:how to use town portal, how to use health potions with numbers, not knowing how to put health potions into belt... its a beginning.
[2022-12-14 18:10:49] <!%AirahsELL> or use health potions.
[2022-12-14 18:10:52] <InaneDugong> going bankrupt speedrun?
[2022-12-14 18:10:54] <NagasakiMH> you are a piece of wet paper at the beginning, regardless of class. they rebalanced D2 resurrected in some things
[2022-12-14 18:10:56] <+JayBusch> Or use potions
[2022-12-14 18:10:57] <Temporal_Paradox> yeah, you need to run back to sell loot anyway
[2022-12-14 18:10:57] <GuyMcGuy> tactical use of portals helps
[2022-12-14 18:10:57] <+DiabloGraves> I mean you don't HAVE to be a coward, you can be a brave dead person
[2022-12-14 18:11:01] <CanofUniGear> make a TP before getting into danger, and you dont lose anything on death on normal, so dont worry
[2022-12-14 18:11:03] <%Sotetsu> Only the bravest cowards run away.

[2022-12-14 18:11:13] <SteelRat0> is this your first death?
[2022-12-14 18:11:15] <%TalkingObject> Don't you just drag it?>
[2022-12-14 18:11:16] <Womperschnitzel> just drag and drop
[2022-12-14 18:11:16] <GuyMcGuy> in town, move the potion from inventiry to belt
[2022-12-14 18:11:18] <NagasakiMH> in Og barb really was easy because of an exploit, but that probably doesnt work in ressurected
[2022-12-14 18:11:20] <fylkzahdeyax> you don't go deeper. That's like spongebob driving a car.
[2022-12-14 18:11:31] <newtonia09> God sends the bravest soldiers to the hardest diablo levels
[2022-12-14 18:11:32] <Womperschnitzel> you just drag the potions from your inventory to your belt
[2022-12-14 18:11:32] <Proteus42> Setting up hotkeys for skills too.
[2022-12-14 18:11:36] <NekripTor> You didn't lose much, it's better to lvl up some more before going in
[2022-12-14 18:11:40] <Temporal_Paradox> barb is fine
[2022-12-14 18:11:41] <newtonia09> Barbarian is the easiest
[2022-12-14 18:11:41] <!%AirahsELL> oli please look at the controls to see what your hotkeys are. there should be a "use health potion" button.
[2022-12-14 18:11:44] <GuyMcGuy> starting out as another class is the same basics :)
[2022-12-14 18:11:46] <twFROMAN> Necromancer is a lot of fun!!!
[2022-12-14 18:11:46] <Appleman6> Sure
[2022-12-14 18:11:48] <WirtsThirdLeg> druid summoner!!!!
[2022-12-14 18:11:48] <%Sotetsu> Sorcerous is fun. Pew pew!
[2022-12-14 18:11:48] <InaneDugong> NotLikeThis
[2022-12-14 18:11:49] <%PigWithoutProtection> remember to use your skills too.
[2022-12-14 18:11:50] <LoxTyx69> necro is easier
[2022-12-14 18:11:52] <+JayBusch> I mean, you‚Äôll have to start completely over
[2022-12-14 18:11:57] <redmanticore> i mean it will be the same problem in all classes
[2022-12-14 18:12:01] <CanofUniGear> nerco is easier yeah
[2022-12-14 18:12:02] <newtonia09> Necro has the issue of managing mana
[2022-12-14 18:12:04] <!%AirahsELL> we will have the same problems if you do
[2022-12-14 18:12:04] <%Leon27607> Barb is only easy in the beginning but falls off late game
[2022-12-14 18:12:04] <Temporal_Paradox> everyone is kind of the same at this point in the game
[2022-12-14 18:12:15] <GuyMcGuy> once you get and use skills you'll be able to kill enemies easier
[2022-12-14 18:12:16] <Womperschnitzel> barbarian is a good beginner class
[2022-12-14 18:12:21] <NagasakiMH> nothing is easy in D2 when you paly it first time
[2022-12-14 18:12:29] <InaneDugong> Can you exit the dungeon without finishing it?
[2022-12-14 18:12:30] <!%AirahsELL> oli needs to learn how to use a keyboard
[2022-12-14 18:12:34] <GuyMcGuy> but you have to get there first LUL
[2022-12-14 18:12:40] <%+Dataskvid> PALY DIBLO???
[2022-12-14 18:12:40] <InaneDugong> Like, just turn around and go home kinda thing?
[2022-12-14 18:12:43] <Redamaford> In general if you spend too much time not getting exp or items this is what happens.
[2022-12-14 18:12:44] <%Megaket> To put potions into the belt slots you just drag and drop them from your inventory
[2022-12-14 18:12:44] <NagasakiMH> there is no cheesy way around, and thats good this way
[2022-12-14 18:12:49] <Redamaford> It's an ARPG staple.
[2022-12-14 18:12:50] <Temporal_Paradox> just keep an eye on your HP and pull back when you need to. use skills/potions and keep upgrading gear. you'll be fine
[2022-12-14 18:12:55] <GuyMcGuy> the good news here: we've mapped the part of the cave that goes to the wrong exit prenSip

[2022-12-14 18:13:42] <%PigWithoutProtection> equip the armor yo uhave in the inventory too?
[2022-12-14 18:13:42] <+JayBusch> Oli, when you run back to get stuff, don‚Äôt just ignore enemies. You need to level up to be strong too.
[2022-12-14 18:13:45] <newtonia09> Hardcore on being easy :)
[2022-12-14 18:13:50] <%PigWithoutProtection> or was it higher lvl than what Olivia is?
[2022-12-14 18:13:50] <GuyMcGuy> it can help if you just keep the left hand hovering over 1234
[2022-12-14 18:13:53] <InaneDugong> Isn't hardcore = permadeath?
[2022-12-14 18:13:56] <NagasakiMH> hardcore mode is permadeath loose everything you have collected in cahr stash and game progress

[2022-12-14 18:15:48] <%PigWithoutProtection> put the armor on too?
[2022-12-14 18:15:53] <Redamaford> All active skills use mana.
[2022-12-14 18:15:57] <+Ser_Destroyer> that might be a problem? why aren't you using mana?
[2022-12-14 18:15:58] <MagikBased> press "S" then hover over the spell and press f1-10
[2022-12-14 18:16:01] <%PigWithoutProtection> you only lose if you die dont you?

[2022-12-14 18:19:36] <%+aathray> my first computer came with a little piece of paper above the F keys that said what the common shortcuts were, like F1 save, F2 new
[2022-12-14 18:19:40] <MagikBased> well assign them first
[2022-12-14 18:19:42] <%ArcReaper_21> Makes it even more confusing when keyboards added in an actual separate Function key "Fn"
[2022-12-14 18:19:45] <newtonia09> John Diablo says not in town

[2022-12-14 18:19:59] <olemars> took a while for someone to invent WASD so a bunch of shooters even into the 2000's used arrow keys for movement

[2022-12-14 18:20:51] <%Hentaiwatcher_> it's ok, older games or genre's your not used to can be a bit tricky!

[2022-12-14 18:21:03] <enixtm> it might be an issue but you can reassign the F keys to something else though

[2022-12-14 18:21:52] <!%AirahsELL> you only really need to use like 4 skills so probably not. put your town portal scroll on F10  and F1-4 as your most used skills like attacks.
[2022-12-14 18:21:57] <%PigWithoutProtection> no, you will now do a shout on F1

[2022-12-14 18:22:14] <Redamaford> For most builds you literally only use one or two attacking skills, so this layout works just fine.
[2022-12-14 18:22:17] <SteelRat0> and to think you can have up to 30 skills, lol
[2022-12-14 18:22:24] <+DiabloGraves> Yeah, you wanna use that Howl ability; instead of you being a coward, make THEM cowards LUL
[2022-12-14 18:22:34] <enixtm> yea this is the wierd part, the hotkeys will only put the skill on the bar, you need to right click it to use it
[2022-12-14 18:22:39] <+Ser_Destroyer> yeah the f key will select what skill is equipped then right click to use it
[2022-12-14 18:22:40] <%PigWithoutProtection> oh right thats how it works, it just equips the skill and dont use it. I remembered wrong on that part
[2022-12-14 18:22:47] <Redamaford> Like for barb?   Pick Berserk, Frenzy, Whirwind, (or if you are kind of insane, war cry) and spam that on everything.
[2022-12-14 18:22:48] <GuyMcGuy> my basic layout for the keys is F1 for main dmg skill, F2/F3 for buffs, F8 for portals LUL

[2022-12-14 18:23:50] <!%AirahsELL> if you find it too difficult you might want to go into options and change the controls around to something that works better. i suggest rebinding your skill slots to the number buttons

[2022-12-14 18:25:07] <InaneDugong> 1 2 3 4 F1 F2 F3 F4
[2022-12-14 18:25:08] <ArchWolf1911> Control-C ? Control-C
[2022-12-14 18:25:09] VIEWERS: 376
[2022-12-14 18:25:09] <GuyMcGuy> i blame that person
[2022-12-14 18:25:11] <redmanticore> you can now practice throwing the town portal and entering it and back again
[2022-12-14 18:25:14] <CorvusDelta> 1 is not F1
[2022-12-14 18:25:16] <ArchWolf1911> Control-V
[2022-12-14 18:25:23] <CorvusDelta> 2 is below F1 usually
[2022-12-14 18:25:23] <fylkzahdeyax> what kind of keyboard does she have?..
[2022-12-14 18:25:31] <leo_coelho> I fear we may overload Olivia brain
[2022-12-14 18:25:33] <NekripTor> ThisIsFine
[2022-12-14 18:25:35] <GuyMcGuy> @redmanticore we'd have to buy extra scrolls tho, probably LUL
[2022-12-14 18:25:39] <$StrikingWalrus> ThisIsFine
[2022-12-14 18:25:40] <!%AirahsELL> when I get home I might suggest a control layout to switch to. you can rebind all your keys in this version of the game.
[2022-12-14 18:25:45] <JoesGuy> Let's start with "keys"
[2022-12-14 18:25:46] <newtonia09> use a town portal
[2022-12-14 18:25:50] <enixtm> its doing it
[2022-12-14 18:25:52] <Temporal_Paradox> Oli coxPLEAS
[2022-12-14 18:25:55] <%$GimmeAFreekinUsername> my soul
[2022-12-14 18:25:58] <WirtsThirdLeg> jeosenSad jeosenSad jeosenSad jeosenSad jeosenSad jeosenSad jeosenSad
[2022-12-14 18:26:02] <redmanticore> it only chooses it with "f1", you need to still cast it with right mouse click
[2022-12-14 18:26:03] <MagikBased> you are changing what your right click does, you still need to right click to use them.
[2022-12-14 18:26:05] <%Hentaiwatcher_> should have your character keys,  above that a line of number keys, and above that F number keys
[2022-12-14 18:26:07] <enixtm> try to use a potion on the number keys
[2022-12-14 18:26:07] <%PigWithoutProtection> there you go, you switched between the town portal and shout skills
[2022-12-14 18:26:11] <fylkzahdeyax> yeah let's give her a tutorial on keyboard key!
[2022-12-14 18:26:14] <leo_coelho> Diablo too advanced, lets go back to Tetris
[2022-12-14 18:26:16] <%GinTamashiVT> You got this!

[2022-12-14 18:28:26] <Redamaford> THIS IS THE IMPROVED VERSION
[2022-12-14 18:28:27] <%RabidBeefalo> there's at least 4 steam gamers

[2022-12-14 18:28:40] <%+aathray> It's funny because lately I've been leaning on games that are more controller friendly
[2022-12-14 18:28:49] <InaneDugong> like dota2
[2022-12-14 18:28:53] <%+AMooseOnSpeed> im the same, got a gaming rig in october, use a controller for everything

[2022-12-14 18:29:48] <InaneDugong> @GinTamashiVT yeah it is
[2022-12-14 18:29:48] <+DiabloGraves> Right, but now you're out of town portals so it's reverted to basic attack with right click
[2022-12-14 18:29:54] <%Hentaiwatcher_> olivia50Pat
[2022-12-14 18:29:56] <GuyMcGuy> yup the right icon is your rightclick action, the left icon is the left click action. the arrow is Attack With Weapon
[2022-12-14 18:30:04] <%GinTamashiVT> @allhailkingjulian Thats what I thought! LUL
[2022-12-14 18:30:08] <WirtsThirdLeg> the other one is your left click skills

[2022-12-14 18:30:48] <%$GimmeAFreekinUsername> if its a driving game then controller but for shooters and stuff KBM

[2022-12-14 18:31:09] <%Hentaiwatcher_> action adventure games, racing and fighting work nicely on controller
[2022-12-14 18:31:16] <%PigWithoutProtection> I mean you can kill some of them on the way

[2022-12-14 18:31:53] <fylkzahdeyax> and then during the game. Your battery runs out and rip controller XD...
[2022-12-14 18:31:57] <marklarphd> Imo, kb/m is more strain on your hand than controller in most cases

[2022-12-14 18:52:58] <@%owlishnick> Moving five inches then having to start from zero until you get a little further is just real life, this is a sim game
[2022-12-14 18:52:59] <Womperschnitzel> I guess farming could be good. You get exp and also get to learn the buttons in peace
[2022-12-14 18:53:04] <$Tsucchie_> Pog collab
[2022-12-14 18:53:05] <%$GimmeAFreekinUsername> ohhhh Coqui is poggers

[2022-12-14 18:53:17] <Temporal_Paradox> Just weak enough that you're not struggling with them and using all your resources. Its designed to run back to town often to sell and heal
[2022-12-14 18:53:17] <chromasnare> yeah, that collab looks like it will be fun
[2022-12-14 18:53:18] <%Hentaiwatcher_> collab with coqui, that's awesome!
[2022-12-14 18:53:25] <raxx1217> You need to start making a Necromancer Oli
[2022-12-14 18:53:31] <mewmewkissycutie_> players 8 sets monsters dmg and health as if there were 8 players

[2022-12-14 18:53:46] <+PumpkinPieman> Coqui is going to turn Oli in to a delinquent.
[2022-12-14 18:53:50] <Tolrath1> Necromancer is a pretty good soloing class
[2022-12-14 18:53:57] <raxx1217> It would be less painful for you
[2022-12-14 18:54:05] <Temporal_Paradox> If you want to change it up, it is still pretty early. Not sure it would help that much, but necros do make other creatures that fight for you. it might help
[2022-12-14 18:54:07] <newtonia09> you click it?
[2022-12-14 18:54:09] <chromasnare> I can't remember the last time I played this, i'll be no help coquiFine
[2022-12-14 18:54:10] <%$GimmeAFreekinUsername> practice
[2022-12-14 18:54:10] <Womperschnitzel> muscle memory
[2022-12-14 18:54:11] <enixtm> necro is good, but there's many buttons though

[2022-12-14 18:54:16] <%TACNextGen> Just practice
[2022-12-14 18:54:17] <%Megaket> Necromancer is a class where you have twenty skeletons that do everything for you so you don't have to worry about anything
[2022-12-14 18:54:17] <%StuckBoy> two decades of muscle memory
[2022-12-14 18:54:19] <$StrikingWalrus> practice
[2022-12-14 18:54:20] <Temporal_Paradox> muscle memory. Play some Mario Teaches Typing
[2022-12-14 18:54:23] <%TalkingObject> Just click them
[2022-12-14 18:54:29] <fz5_94> experience
[2022-12-14 18:54:30] <mewmewkissycutie_> oh that's muscle memory
[2022-12-14 18:54:35] <%Sotetsu> Practice
[2022-12-14 18:54:39] <newtonia09> hover your hand on the numbers
[2022-12-14 18:54:40] <mango__7> you could get one of those fancy mmo mouses with 9 side buttons
[2022-12-14 18:54:42] <ughdontmakemeregister> cuute
[2022-12-14 18:54:42] <baccon13> just have your left little fingers on numbers
[2022-12-14 18:54:44] <+DiabloGraves> I mean if you really want you can program a controller to map the buttons to keys but that takes some setup
[2022-12-14 18:54:45] <Womperschnitzel> been using keyboards since mid 90's, you tend to learn the button locations in that time
[2022-12-14 18:54:47] <clamps00> If it makes you feel better I forget how to breath from time to time
[2022-12-14 18:54:49] <redmanticore> even diablo cries sometimes gazacaPET
[2022-12-14 18:54:49] <+SirHawke> position your fingers on said numbers, remember which is on what number, and press it
[2022-12-14 18:54:58] <+Ser_Destroyer> usually over the numbers there is a space so it should be easy to find them
[2022-12-14 18:54:59] <%+Abstract_Endurance> howdy ho chatterinos
[2022-12-14 18:54:59] <%GinTamashiVT> Like how do I know where my fingers are? It's kind of like driving. When you're younger, you have to watch your feet on the petals, but eventually it become second nature
[2022-12-14 18:54:59] <@%owlishnick> macro learning stream time
[2022-12-14 18:55:05] <MagikBased> Just go to diablo and ask him to stop. he legally cannot forge soulstones if you say no.

[2022-12-14 18:55:14] <Tolrath1> Theres some mouses with 12 buttons, like the Razer Naga series
[2022-12-14 18:55:15] <%$GimmeAFreekinUsername> 3
[2022-12-14 18:55:16] <Proteus42> You just memorize the placement of the keyboard like you do when you type for "clicking numbers"
[2022-12-14 18:55:17] <newtonia09> practice clicking numbers now?

[2022-12-14 18:55:17] <Temporal_Paradox> most people that played this game have been using keyboards since before this game came out. You just get used to it

[2022-12-14 18:55:24] <+Ser_Destroyer> or keep your hand there
[2022-12-14 18:55:24] <squishybulgogi> gotta make oli play Mavis Beacon to become a good typist

[2022-12-14 18:55:27] <fylkzahdeyax> left ring finger on 1, middle finger on 2, index finger on 3 or 4. You need to learn a certain habit
[2022-12-14 18:55:30] <enixtm> also there's no shame in running from some monsters, if you start seeing many arrows flying its ok to run away.
[2022-12-14 18:55:31] <Proteus42> "clicking numbers" is more like "typing numbers"
[2022-12-14 18:55:39] <%ABRAoriginal> Oli doing "Typing of the Dead"

[2022-12-14 18:56:00] <Tolrath1> i think you could change the control bindings in the options
[2022-12-14 18:56:01] <Proteus42> Mavis Beacon typing game is what I used growing learning to type on the keyboard.
[2022-12-14 18:56:02] <newtonia09> yeah, I beat this game when I was 6 years old LUL
[2022-12-14 18:56:02] <mewmewkissycutie_> my mom is farming mephisto as we speak, you can do it
[2022-12-14 18:56:04] <+DiabloGraves> Nono, it's a game called Typing of the Dead
[2022-12-14 18:56:05] <wallchicken> You're not wrong, there
[2022-12-14 18:56:08] <Womperschnitzel> Typing of the Dead is a on-the-rails shooter where you have to type words fast to shoot the enemies
[2022-12-14 18:56:08] <chromasnare> might want to check out Epic Story or Typing of the dead. fun games where you attack by typing
[2022-12-14 18:56:13] <%ABRAoriginal> Typing of the Dead is a typing video game where you type to kill zombies

[2022-12-14 18:57:19] <newtonia09> hmm.... Path of Exile is a diablo clone, you can try that
[2022-12-14 18:57:26] <%Hentaiwatcher_> everythings easy if you're used to the controls,  if you've never played before it takes a little bit of time to learn it and get used to the movements for the keys
[2022-12-14 18:57:28] <rockmih> Diablo 3 is definitely easier
[2022-12-14 18:57:32] <enixtm> path of exile is 999999% harder
[2022-12-14 18:57:33] <baccon13> dont worry about it, just have fun, it's diablo and you'll die a lot
[2022-12-14 18:57:37] <wallchicken> It's easy, but you need the gaming practice for better reaction time
[2022-12-14 18:57:39] <Temporal_Paradox> Why do you think we all knew about finding your corpse
[2022-12-14 18:57:43] <+Ser_Destroyer> yeah it's normal to die a lot at the beginning
[2022-12-14 18:57:44] <melly_is_besty> so Skyrim? oh, then Elden Ring. or Doom.
[2022-12-14 18:57:45] <%Apteix> I'm imagining Oli playing Deus Ex and it's great
[2022-12-14 18:57:48] <Womperschnitzel> dying is part of Diablo. You get smacked around and then you learn from that and try to do better
[2022-12-14 18:57:51] <chromasnare> what type of games do you generally like?
[2022-12-14 18:57:54] <%GinTamashiVT> You deserve a hug! olivia50Heart
[2022-12-14 18:58:04] <newtonia09> I think you're having trouble because you don't have the obligatory mountain dew?
[2022-12-14 18:58:05] <!%AirahsELL> Path of Exile is NEEDLESSLY complicated. imagine if the ff10 orbs system and ff7 materia system had an onholy demonspawn. thsts Path of Exile.
[2022-12-14 18:58:08] <%Grawne> You can't get good in 2 hours

[2022-12-14 18:58:10] <Temporal_Paradox> Isn't there a difficulty setting as well?
[2022-12-14 18:58:10] <Komfigaming> just look on steam for games you think are fun and play that! pc gaming doesn't mean one or two games, it's eveeything
[2022-12-14 18:58:11] <clamps00> Dying is repetitive for these types of games LUL
[2022-12-14 18:58:12] <Proteus42> you have to farm

[2022-12-14 18:58:40] <Komfigaming> they are for functions
[2022-12-14 18:58:41] <olemars> they're for functions
[2022-12-14 18:58:45] <mango__7> so you can trick people into pressing alt+F4
[2022-12-14 18:58:45] <%StuckBoy> Programs do different things with them
[2022-12-14 18:58:55] <!%AirahsELL> F1 is usually a help button for example
[2022-12-14 18:58:56] <fylkzahdeyax> F1 in most programs is the "help" function

[2022-12-14 18:59:00] <MagikBased> Maybe playing League of Legends is a good way to learn pressing the numbers and the top row of keys.
[2022-12-14 18:59:01] <steelgolem9> function keys are from a time when we didn't use mice, and needed hotkeys for "help", and "load" and "save"

[2022-12-14 18:59:25] <Temporal_Paradox> You can always come back to it if you're not feeling up to it yet. It IS fairly advanced for people new to gaming

[2022-12-14 18:59:56] <%gorillafinn> stop doing it
[2022-12-14 18:59:56] <Temporal_Paradox> Don't just do it

[2022-12-14 19:00:30] <wallchicken> stopping under a rain of arrows is how you've died the last 2 times
[2022-12-14 19:00:31] <Temporal_Paradox> Alt+f4 just closes the program, it's not funny

[2022-12-14 19:02:26] <%+Dataskvid> If you want to learn how to remember keys start with using your index finger on 4 and then the rest of the fingers on 3, 2 and 1. Muscle memory is most of it

[2022-12-14 19:03:04] <Temporal_Paradox> Diablo also works in a weird sort of way with lobbies. It was common to leave a game and start a new one with the same character, to fight bosses you've beaten over and over again for new loot. You could do that too

[2022-12-14 19:25:34] <FullM3talErn> @mango__7 current day diablo 3 isnt worth playing imo. it was good pre reaper of souls and a bit after. If you want the "spiritual" successor to diablo 2 try path of exile.
[2022-12-14 19:25:38] <InaneDugong> This is easy.

[2022-12-14 19:26:19] <FullM3talErn> @OliviaMonroe Yeah diablo 2 isnt easy, it looks basic but this game was earth shatteringly advanced for when it came out
[2022-12-14 19:26:19] <enixtm> try to find the waypoint first!
[2022-12-14 19:26:22] <%^StreamElements> Thank you for following lagatras :)

[2022-12-14 19:26:53] <Proteus42> This game was amazing when it first came out. There was nothing like it at the time.
[2022-12-14 19:26:53] <FollowingSnail> Yeah, there is so much stuff under the hood. this game is super complex
[2022-12-14 19:27:03] <+watabou207> I can't wait to see Act 3
[2022-12-14 19:27:06] <Proteus42> like mind blowing.

[2022-12-14 19:27:28] <Proteus42> Diablo 2 is gold standard of how to make a fun game.
[2022-12-14 19:27:37] <%Hentaiwatcher_> nagHandsup well done
[2022-12-14 19:27:47] <FollowingSnail> It might just be me but I always felt like the Barbarian was the hardest character to play
[2022-12-14 19:27:54] <+watabou207> hello streamer, did anyone tell you, you look like Kokomi from Genshin?
[2022-12-14 19:27:57] <newtonia09> No more Axes, maces are my best friend now
[2022-12-14 19:27:57] <Proteus42> fun
[2022-12-14 19:27:59] <Vincanthofred> oh no you guys made her start as barbarian
[2022-12-14 19:28:00] <redmanticore> also you have blue mana potions on belt, those wont heal.
[2022-12-14 19:28:00] <Womperschnitzel> and that clink means level up
[2022-12-14 19:28:05] <$ShadowMoon878> sorceror is hardest
[2022-12-14 19:28:05] <@%Athagorn> @leo_coelho It does not, iirc.
[2022-12-14 19:28:06] <%gorillafinn> barbarian absolutely isnt hardest
[2022-12-14 19:28:08] <Vincanthofred> it's the most boring one KEKW
[2022-12-14 19:28:12] <Redamaford> He can be tricky since his early skills are just... hitting stuff but different.
[2022-12-14 19:28:15] <%$ipponsky> She's pretty
[2022-12-14 19:28:21] <$lalo_undascore> laloun2SOCIETY
[2022-12-14 19:28:23] <!GoodishGames> are you saying that games can't be fun AND hard?
[2022-12-14 19:28:26] <Redamaford> Meanwhile the other classes can do stuff OTHER then just hitting things early.
[2022-12-14 19:28:26] <newtonia09> kokomi isn't a gremlim though
[2022-12-14 19:28:32] <%Megaket> She looks like she could be your granddaughter
[2022-12-14 19:28:33] <InaneDugong> &
[2022-12-14 19:28:34] <InaneDugong> ^
[2022-12-14 19:28:37] <FullM3talErn> @OliviaMonroe Yeah barbarian is the HARDEST class to start solo with. I hate myself and like to suffer so thats why im level 91 barb in single player
[2022-12-14 19:28:42] <Vincanthofred> I would have started as druid, paladin or sorceress
[2022-12-14 19:28:43] <newtonia09> LUL
[2022-12-14 19:28:48] <%GinTamashiVT> It's actually true. I actually thought she was a mod for you
[2022-12-14 19:28:49] <Proteus42> LUL
[2022-12-14 19:28:54] <Vincanthofred> maybe assassin
[2022-12-14 19:28:54] <leo_coelho> We found olie granddaughter?
[2022-12-14 19:28:56] <%Megaket> KEKW
[2022-12-14 19:28:56] <!GoodishGames> oh yeah, i see it
[2022-12-14 19:28:58] <Vincanthofred> or necromancer
[2022-12-14 19:29:01] <%PigWithoutProtection> coquiSnicker

[2022-12-14 19:29:05] <!GoodishGames> definitely a granddaughter
[2022-12-14 19:29:11] <$ShadowMoon878> sorceror is hardest. because out of mana= dead'

[2022-12-14 19:29:16] <FollowingSnail> @Redamaford Yeah, barbar has easily the worst early game. Sorc can be bit of a bore with simple "Shoot one thing" spells

[2022-12-14 19:29:32] <leo_coelho> @GoodishGames time to update the Olivia wiki
[2022-12-14 19:29:35] <%$ipponsky> Why is granny angry for having a granddaughter? bakukyCry
[2022-12-14 19:29:37] <Temporal_Paradox> Oli is new to these kinds of games, so honestly the most straight forward barb is probably a good way to go for now
[2022-12-14 19:29:45] <%TalkingObject> She has a unga bunga brain,
[2022-12-14 19:29:53] <FullM3talErn> if you want sword and shield go paladin
[2022-12-14 19:29:55] <GL_HF_Guy> There are 2hand weapons
[2022-12-14 19:29:58] <%PigWithoutProtection> I usually went druid and went werewolf for the hp steal and fast runspeed

[2022-12-14 19:30:03] <Obsidian_Dragoon> Great Sword is good unga bunga in Monster Hunter
[2022-12-14 19:30:12] <FollowingSnail> Paladin can be very unga bunga
[2022-12-14 19:30:20] <newtonia09> did you just raise your eyebrows? LUL
[2022-12-14 19:30:23] <!GoodishGames> see, you said Sword and Shield and my brain said "Pokemon?"
[2022-12-14 19:30:23] <baccon13> sword and shield is actually most complex weapon
[2022-12-14 19:30:24] <!%AirahsELL> i mean that makes no sense considering sword and shield is one of the most complicated weapons in the game. unga bunga is hammer or greatsword
[2022-12-14 19:30:25] <Temporal_Paradox> coquiCheer
[2022-12-14 19:30:32] <marklarphd> Nvm, Olivia probably hasn't played Monster Hunter

[2022-12-14 19:37:05] <%PigWithoutProtection> yeah technically, but majority of ppl just use pc games thru steam or other similar platform
[2022-12-14 19:37:06] <MagikBased> i think its northwest
[2022-12-14 19:37:07] <Proteus42> There was Warcraft 1, 2, and 3. They were Realtime Strategy PC games.
