[2022-12-28 01:02:39] <dredlock470> so would it just be soaking bread in egg then cook no added extra stuff?

[2022-12-28 12:54:37] <Vaizel88> @P01S0N_IV I think one shots isnt healthy for the game and even if she has cause shes a sniper ofc she shouldnt have every one sec, a good widow can only be countered with another good widow, just good aim shouldnt be this rewarding and she can win fights only by herself (I know flankers and winston and all that but like on circuit royal first point you cant get to the widow, and if they go winston you can easily defend widow with brig or reaper) I think she should be nerfed or reworked

[2022-12-28 13:25:09] <TenshiAUSSIE> increase
[2022-12-28 13:25:21] <%$ThisIsCrabTV> Hey, that's the same Reinhardt as in the previous match
[2022-12-28 13:25:22] <+bruddaoasisfromdabooshes> she needs faster fire rate
[2022-12-28 13:25:25] <+zelorus_1> compare to other Tanks i think she goes down pretty fast
[2022-12-28 13:25:26] <Goofy0W> @Kawazoey not me tho
[2022-12-28 13:25:26] <kajezerk> would you say increase her bleed as well?
[2022-12-28 13:25:27] <%+masakiss_eucalyptus> so called spicy changes on jq dont necessarily mean buff right?

[2022-12-28 13:25:34] <aceofoverwatch> I think junkerqueen needs more heals from the bleed effect and 475hp
[2022-12-28 13:25:36] <%$ThisIsCrabTV> @kajezerk It already got increased
[2022-12-28 13:25:40] <Goofy0W> I lived twice BBoomer
[2022-12-28 13:25:44] <Tobin> just wait out suzu to use JQ ult KKona
[2022-12-28 13:25:53] <%$ThisIsCrabTV> I actually believe that her upkeep is in a good state
[2022-12-28 13:26:00] <HenriqueCaiu> emongW_BW
[2022-12-28 13:26:42] <+zelorus_1> i think the heal is a bit weak she gots from bleeds, dmg inc is to big compared
[2022-12-28 13:26:44] <+bruddaoasisfromdabooshes> well guru is good at junker queen
[2022-12-28 13:26:45] <%$ThisIsCrabTV> When you don't play against a oneshot team (which is kind of common when playing in low elo) then her upkeep is pretty good and doesn't need buffs imo
[2022-12-28 13:26:58] <kasper93> mtd
[2022-12-28 13:27:08] <%$ThisIsCrabTV> The only thing I would maybe change is to decrease the shout CD by 2 seconds

[2022-12-28 13:53:12] <%WolfIsBad_> oh you have iddqd and Kragie on dps, how is this game losable lol
[2022-12-28 13:53:23] <darthraider100> @bruddaoasisfromdabooshes because bronze players have no clue how to use anything else anyway
[2022-12-28 13:53:26] <%+rhundley> because she has good mobility and Bronze have memory issues the minute she fades
[2022-12-28 13:53:27] <gravity1992> Moira past diamond is usually looked down on. Much better range healing and other supports have better kits

[2022-12-28 13:56:01] <+bruddaoasisfromdabooshes> @Nennai I was "researching" in bronze and found that most people shoot at you for 10s and then forget youre even there
[2022-12-28 13:56:10] <+MalumIncarnum> Moira is a beast of a healer if you can figure out a balance
[2022-12-28 13:56:10] <PratishSungum> I usually get more heals than dmg on Moira though I focus dmg orbs

[2022-12-28 13:57:03] <gravity1992> Moira had a duality that makes her too neutral
[2022-12-28 13:57:05] <+tairdnaxela> it was just to my point
[2022-12-28 13:57:14] <norkieehoc> i mostly get 15k-25k healing depeding on the match, but yeah she's quite good in that regard
[2022-12-28 13:57:18] <%cubixx_ow> shes not that enjoyable imo

[2022-12-28 13:57:18] <+tairdnaxela> shes the only support that has the ability to do that
[2022-12-28 13:57:21] <%$ThisIsCrabTV> Moiras that don't use healing orbs only feed and don't do anything useful. If you want to really annoyingly harass their backline you use the Healing Orb a lot for yourself

[2022-12-28 13:57:25] <+tairdnaxela> other than bap i guess

[2022-12-28 14:01:07] <+DaylightDemon> @rhundley they really should think about reverting some of his buffs in the history of ow. like for example him needing to stand still while healing or his heal giving damage reduction

[2022-12-28 15:00:10] <%+ProjektTheory> Put rail gun on a cooldown
[2022-12-28 15:00:12] <%Kawazoey> Her dash and jump
[2022-12-28 15:00:13] <ineedpineapples> put another second on her slide obviously LUL

[2022-12-28 15:00:30] <%iliketoeatpineapples> @soeholttt need to rework him. fully
[2022-12-28 15:00:34] <xdToby_> maybe they should add more recoil and slower charging to her?

[2022-12-28 15:01:14] <+enpeece> make it similar to monkey railgun
[2022-12-28 15:01:16] <+MietzeKatze157> lol eben before the rail the damage of normal bullets is too high @Emongg
[2022-12-28 15:01:18] <+MizzXerox> I'm definitely not biased and an Orisa main or anything...totally don't want her ult buffed for me... jeaLol jeaLol
[2022-12-28 15:01:26] <yorandomman12> And her kit lets her play aggressive or high ground far
[2022-12-28 15:01:31] <derpflerb> might be a very specific question but where are you from?
[2022-12-28 15:01:34] <renananan63> what do you think about Kiriko???
[2022-12-28 15:01:35] <sogeking3d2y> Slower rail gun charge build could work and no building it off shields
[2022-12-28 15:01:41] <soeholttt> Emongg how do you think they will make hog work? if he doesnt have his one shot, he will be absolute trash.
[2022-12-28 15:01:43] <%$ThisIsCrabTV> Railgun builds way too fast tbh

[2022-12-28 15:02:08] <+Trottie_xD> could make the smg hit scan and weaker and the railgun projectile

[2022-12-28 15:02:19] <%Dewrand> Hog's has had his hook/1shot combo for 6 years...why now
[2022-12-28 15:02:21] <no_one_911> healers need massive changes to become a support what do think @emongg

[2022-12-28 15:02:23] <+ge0dnb> why on earth would they make the character useless while they "figure it out "
[2022-12-28 15:02:30] <Risen_Phoenix21> imo. tanks should do much less damage and supports should have more health. the main damage should be dps as it's their name. tanks doo too much as is rn and supports die to a feather touching them
[2022-12-28 15:02:31] <needabetterpig> they're gonna do hog like my boy doom in season 1 lhcloudySadge
[2022-12-28 15:02:32] <+ZukaZealanee> nothing
[2022-12-28 15:02:34] <+padrehoss> Which leaves like 3 good tanks. Lol

[2022-12-28 15:02:42] <GregoriusDaneli> How to Nerf Hog: Step 1) Find a glitch with him. Step 2) Removed for three weeks.
[2022-12-28 15:02:43] <%+Bumpy1031> just make his hook range to 1 foot away
[2022-12-28 15:02:44] <iLouWavy> Maybe make railgun work almost like echo beam

[2022-12-28 15:10:49] <Antarctic_Citizens> wonder how ranked would play if they replaced open queue with an optional "Flex Queue" option... where you can group up to 5 at all levels, but it still locks to roles
[2022-12-28 15:10:49] <kite_1713> Ram needs more hp in his base form hes a very meltable tank
[2022-12-28 15:10:54] <%stillarobyn> @dontejxoxo right, that's why the last patch of the OWL this season was Winston, Sojourn, Reaper mirror matches. But that was two patches ago now

[2022-12-28 15:35:42] <BigSerg_98> playing as Mei is fun still too throwing out an ice wall almost endlessly is amazing to me
[2022-12-28 15:35:43] <%+zepinkone> those sheild generators you can hide was awesome
[2022-12-28 15:35:44] <Gl1tch_THL> I think they should change MOIRA where the healing "ammo" is unlimted then the damage "ammo" does. and she has to heal in order to damage not damage in order to heal o.o idk
[2022-12-28 15:35:46] <Dubdadda> this is what "playing" OW feels like

[2022-12-28 15:48:00] <+starvdwolf> her old shield was worthless
[2022-12-28 15:48:01] <+Protoman20XX> I'm fine with this slower hero release schedule, as with the case for OW1, there were heroes that kept throwing things out of whack with every successive release, and usually for the worse.

[2022-12-28 15:49:05] <%N30NxL1T3x> pull was fun the range was crazy
[2022-12-28 15:49:06] <+Hydrate_km> they should bring the pul back but it's the javelin

[2022-12-28 15:49:13] <Andolono> Fortify is the most unfun thing to play against vs Orisa though. She is more unfun to play against now than in OW1 imo.

[2022-12-28 15:50:56] <d5ar_k> h
[2022-12-28 15:50:57] <dontejxoxo> I would give it a slower rate to get hook
[2022-12-28 15:50:59] <%+brabbers_> give him a motorcycle and make him a mobile tank
[2022-12-28 15:51:02] <%+phantastic321> Who in your opinion was the most overpowered hero on release?
[2022-12-28 15:51:03] <biginvestments> i say decrease hit hook length
[2022-12-28 15:51:07] <moggadeet> poor roghog Sadge
[2022-12-28 15:51:07] <biginvestments> his
[2022-12-28 15:51:12] <mrwang30> They should buff hog. Longer hook, more damage, more healing
[2022-12-28 15:51:14] <+jake16411> they should just give him longer hook cooldown
[2022-12-28 15:51:19] <xxsebixx1234> opinion on genji nerfed???
[2022-12-28 15:51:20] <+MightyMakki> Roadhog hook now pulls 12m instead of the full 20m. That way he can still 1 shot but it's not so punishing to be playing the objective.

[2022-12-28 15:52:18] <KingCheepCheep6> I love that orisa is now a direct hog counter though
[2022-12-28 15:52:19] <+Kolteas> Completely agree. I definitely love the re-work Orisa...but the OW1 right-click was fun in low elos getting good pulls for environment deaths.
[2022-12-28 15:52:23] <+JunglePL> Since the changes ill tried ONCE to play the Orisa and i dint like it. I don't understand why they didnt make another character and just one skills completely... But its Blizzard...

[2022-12-28 15:53:55] <kliessen> the Jav throw has potential to be way more satisfying and clutch than the orb ever was.

I also wouldn't mind going back to the idea that supports don't have to heal in anyway. Example being old Sym with her shields as the utility. Cheer100 Cheer100 Cheer100 Cheer100

[2022-12-28 16:35:39] <%stillarobyn> @n0meh9 I'm not sure how it works under the hood. I think also another issue with it would be Blizzard being hesitant to say that certain playstyles are more valid. For instance, using damage numbers as a comparison for an ana player, which can be really powerful, but so can healing numbers. you might be the top 1% of mercys in terms of pistol accuracy, but does blizzard want elims to be the mark for success for Mercy?

[2022-12-28 16:49:40] <calamityProphet> @tm_901 in my incredibly low ranked opinion, I'd say it's a skill thing (be it a diff in Soldier's favor or against him); if you know how to position, can secure kills, etc. you should do well, but if you're just shooting the tank and getting yourself killed...

[2022-12-28 16:50:28] <yGihkkk> @n0meh9 I'm not sure how it works under the hood. I think also another issue with it would be Blizzard being hesitant to say that certain playstyles are more valid. For instance, using damage numbers as a comparison for an ana player, which can be really powerful, but so can healing numbers. you might be the top 1% of mercys in terms of pistol accuracy, but does blizzard want elims to be the mark for success for Mercy?

[2022-12-28 17:03:30] <DecialTv> i see kiriko lucii more
[2022-12-28 17:03:34] <DecialTv> lucio
[2022-12-28 17:03:37] <friedbento> lots of mercy, rarely lucio
[2022-12-28 17:03:37] <nobothehobo_> It is in low ranks with mercy mains and Reddit lucios
[2022-12-28 17:03:38] <%+brominn> I see mostly Mercy Moira, or Lucio Moira
[2022-12-28 17:03:39] <%izzykizzy3> i think mercy and lucio is a bad comp imo
[2022-12-28 17:03:41] <xShroomies> occasionally people will try to force it but one will usually swap if you point it out to them
[2022-12-28 17:03:46] <@%^StreamElements> If you're noticing ads at unfortunate times, Twitch now requires all streams to run ads at set intervals. We're not triggering them, they're on Twitch's end and out of our control.
[2022-12-28 17:03:48] <luazri> no it's mostly Mercy Kiriko, Lucio Kiriko
[2022-12-28 17:03:48] <%naultz24> american gladiators? That was a fun show. Lots of steroids, I think.

[2022-12-28 18:44:41] <%Culein_> I am coming back from my 10 minute ban, and I want to say that I think it was bullshit. Yes, I wrote a funny paragraph that turned into copypasta, which happened to bring a laugh or a smile to a few people. If you mods wanted that to stop, you could have just said so, there is so much copypasta going on in this chat that I could have never thought that deserved a 10 minute ban. naultz24 is probably a mod in here and he is the one that banned me. Anyway, I’m glad to be back

[2022-12-28 20:46:14] <+zoom8> @zoom8 what i thought it slightly matters for ur rank is it really just about wins and nothing else would i rank up the same with 5k damage on dps but still win
[2022-12-28 20:46:17] <%ne0n_black> you can have 100% accuracy and 20k damage if you spend all game farming hog, but you'll never win

[2022-12-28 21:03:47] <@%^StreamElements> If you're noticing ads at unfortunate times, Twitch now requires all streams to run ads at set intervals. We're not triggering them, they're on Twitch's end and out of our control.
