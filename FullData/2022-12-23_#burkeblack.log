[2022-12-23 04:24:10] <Vex_Ahlia_CR> pro tip, use little clip seal baggies for the different tokens, or small tupperware containers @BurkeBlack its what i do

[2022-12-23 04:24:27] <%Eumalan> yeah there are alot of cool after market plastic tokens etc, but if you play in tournaments then you have to use the original movement and range finders as some of the plastic ones are a few mm different

[2022-12-23 04:29:29] <Vex_Ahlia_CR> different upgrade cards can change weapons, thats what the dual turret one is for likely
[2022-12-23 04:29:35] <$Djsoulhart> 2.0 is a 200 point limit.
[2022-12-23 04:29:36] <%CyberAilurus> I think you are supposed to turn them while playing to show how your turrets are aimed

[2022-12-23 09:23:23] <K1saac> the show 1883 illustrates it pretty well
[2022-12-23 09:23:32] <%+rambletonne> go watch "English"
[2022-12-23 09:23:35] <+TwystedKynd> While not the Oregon trail itself, the show 1883 does a pretty good depiction of the dangers of heading westward in those times
[2022-12-23 09:23:37] <Reckless_Rob> @thedoucherino you just said: animals would murder plants
[2022-12-23 09:23:42] <+thedoucherino> @Reckless_Rob also not very reckless of you
[2022-12-23 09:23:42] <stellamoon93> liked the english till the end
[2022-12-23 09:23:46] <Darunima> million ways to die in the west :D takes a comedic take on the things that could kill you :D
[2022-12-23 09:23:50] <+doctorpoopypantz> Vaccines weren't a thing, either, so lots of smallpox and measles and all sorts of nice things
[2022-12-23 09:23:51] <+JakeDeviant> Did you play the orginal version of this game?
[2022-12-23 09:23:58] <%+Guttsu_The_Gamer> whta show?
[2022-12-23 09:24:00] <%Twisted_Steel> 1883 is amazing
[2022-12-23 09:24:02] <%djuice_> Since it was so wild, and there was probably no government, authority out there, how'd you claim land if you did come upon fertile arable farm land? Just put down a sign?
[2022-12-23 09:24:06] <%OldGamerJooky> think of walking and dragging a overloaded waggon through 500 miles of deep muddy road
[2022-12-23 09:24:07] <+WoodenMonkeyGod> Consumption was a huge problem
[2022-12-23 09:24:08] <Baldville> medicin woman dr. queen!
[2022-12-23 09:24:09] <%+sel369> Oregon Trail was the trail from the Virginia state (the east coast) to Oregon (the coast state on the other side of USA).  There was not enough land to jobs to work in the east coast, so large groups of people, or even just families, would leave to take the "Oregon Trail" the only confirmed safe route to get there.  It still was a grueling trip, crossing the entire USA to get there with the tech (or lack of it) at that time
[2022-12-23 09:24:10] <+TwystedKynd> @Guttsu_The_Gamer  it's called 1883
[2022-12-23 09:24:14] <%+Guttsu_The_Gamer> ah thx

[2022-12-23 10:14:34] <%GratuitousCatouflage> Across America. Each pod will be in different regions.
[2022-12-23 10:14:41] <Dishes09> @zamlaata : really? i'm saying that based on viewership numbers. where the world cup eclipses the olympics

[2022-12-23 10:14:44] <+thehivemind1> multiple locations, i think

[2022-12-23 10:15:35] <%Diabetic_Cheezeburger> imagine the world cup being held at some random park in a neighborhood rooBobble
[2022-12-23 10:15:38] <+chobtt> it happens sometimes
[2022-12-23 10:15:42] <+x_3_r_o> I don't think so
[2022-12-23 10:15:42] <%+electrigasms> Multiple stadiums
[2022-12-23 10:15:45] <alen_crnalic> It's going to be the biggest yet with 42 countries
[2022-12-23 10:15:52] <%+electrigasms> Even in Qatar they built like 6 stadiums
[2022-12-23 10:15:57] <%+Thod_Nysid> It usually doesn't happen in EU, because there are so MANY football pitches

[2022-12-23 10:16:24] <$LokiTheHarvester> @ant0mus original crossfire was an irl game where you shot like pinballs at spinny things to try to get it into a goal against someone else
[2022-12-23 10:16:30] <+hightowerkiller> no they needed three countries of money to influence fifa this time lol
