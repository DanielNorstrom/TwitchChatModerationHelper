[2023-01-09 09:32:36] <Kappatechy> Hidden Power! It MIGHT be Shed coverage! You won't know until you delete your other Shed coverage! Isn't it great? PridePog
[2023-01-09 09:32:43] <@%Shayy> 70 power rock isn't possible, it'd be dark
[2023-01-09 09:32:49] <%SweetLew_> @kappatechy he has faint attack for shed
[2023-01-09 09:32:57] <jpcicno6> take a chance and rewind lol

[2023-01-09 09:33:57] <Kappatechy> IF this is shed coverage, it's likely better than Faint Attack. But we can't tell if it is or not. muhShrug
[2023-01-09 09:34:01] <@%Shayy> i think it's better than faint attack? idk
[2023-01-09 09:34:03] <jpcicno6> imagine its rock or ground eh
[2023-01-09 09:34:04] <KittehWarlord> Hi teej, how's the run?
[2023-01-09 09:34:07] <%+celadxn> i believe this hidden power is grass
[2023-01-09 09:34:14] <%+celadxn> thats my guess
[2023-01-09 09:34:18] <TrashNutt> Do it for the conten-... I mean 'coverage', yeah
[2023-01-09 09:34:19] <%endrift> @Shayy faint attack is shed coverage
[2023-01-09 09:34:26] <@%Shayy> ohhh right makes sense

[2023-01-09 10:21:56] <%ocyc> ice has such awful defences
[2023-01-09 10:21:57] <%Ralthien> I mistyped @Annibal I meant Grass. I can't think well at 3 AM

[2023-01-09 10:22:00] <Finngus> Abomasnow has such woeful typing it's amazing
[2023-01-09 10:22:05] <%Rootballa> the third best rock move in gen 3 is weather ball
[2023-01-09 10:22:07] <MotherLeopard87> I'm sad that Ice is so vulnerable, because I think it's such a cool type
[2023-01-09 10:22:08] <aurorajet> !bullshi
[2023-01-09 10:22:08] <Annibal> @Ralthien Not weak to grass either iirc

[2023-01-09 10:22:10] <Angela_Ra> They really need to make ice resist more than one type
[2023-01-09 10:22:13] <Annibal> but it's true that Ice only has 1 resist
[2023-01-09 10:22:15] <@%Taco_Champ> multi-hit moves changing your type is real strong
[2023-01-09 10:22:18] <%ocyc> @Finngus one word for you: frosmoth
[2023-01-09 10:22:20] <Annibal> Ice only resists itself and that's garbage
[2023-01-09 10:22:22] <%+Embossedone> ice at least is a great coverage type
[2023-01-09 10:22:23] <%$Varldin> also rock moves are all like not 100% accuracy too

[2023-01-09 10:58:33] <%+einlanzer625> do they make unflavored hot coffee? preferably whole bean, but ground or pod is fine too
[2023-01-09 10:58:37] <%BridgetEndeavor> As a French Press user, I prefer to grind my own beans anyway since it takes a courser grind
[2023-01-09 10:58:45] <%+celadxn> @DukeFireBird buy one and mail me the contents :)

[2023-01-09 13:28:51] <%S17Master> @etaks The stats will warp to match the stat values of the new mon, ie it could change into lightning fast mon with no SpA, or a ultra tank, or a balance mon
