[2022-12-11 04:28:54] <Rumbidzai> @Rumbidzai Yeah, that works too. I think grinding your own beans and making a cup at the time is the key thing

[2022-12-11 04:29:25] <TodoGuts> If you don't like espresso it's a bad investment. You can still make amazing cappuccinos, etc...there's cheaper machines for that.

[2022-12-11 06:23:33] <thejerii> Please God, I want to impregnate Kim jong un so bad. I want him to bear my children with those beautiful child-bearing hips. That beautiful, radiant asian angel. Like a god, having come down to Earth to cleanse us of our sins.  Kim Jong un is beyond divine. I can’t help but drop to my knees in worship whenever I see his beautiful figure. I yearn for him in a way both primal and spiritual. I would commit more war crimes than every president in United States history just to lick the sweat.

[2022-12-11 09:13:06] <%robandfyr_4> (Low-key and quiet confidence) ..
[2022-12-11 09:13:10] <+dan2L> one of my ceramics projects exploded and it took out the other projects that were next to it LUL
[2022-12-11 09:13:30] <+saxm13> was it the same with music? like playing the drums was more hobby?
[2022-12-11 09:13:36] <+jajajordie> I mean currently what you do is a form of art no?
[2022-12-11 09:13:44] <katyjaja> Is ther eany type of stream u wanna do but dont know how to approach it?
[2022-12-11 09:13:53] <CoffeeDelite> a safe space hobby?

[2022-12-11 09:14:10] <%+HonourableOne> So do you still do it in your spare time as a hobby?
[2022-12-11 09:14:21] <4rt420> But I’m glad we can easily monetize creative ideas now
[2022-12-11 09:14:22] <+saxm13> i  wonder how many streamers see their form of entertainment as an artform
[2022-12-11 09:14:22] <%+grimgore33> streaming can be creative so it fills a thing for you

[2022-12-11 10:02:04] <m2monsoon> and sometimes they romanticized it. saying the "bad" things were actually good things
[2022-12-11 10:02:05] <thadonza> SAME. I went to 6 different schools before high school.

[2022-12-11 10:02:20] <+AnAwakenedPanda> parents give their kids to shut them up and calm them down
[2022-12-11 10:02:22] <+bmariod> Nobody really knows how to raise a kid you just do the best you can
[2022-12-11 10:02:26] <+Calcool321> yes ipad kids
[2022-12-11 10:02:30] <ligmalBlgwayvos> I think it's better now that parents can share their experiences with other parents and collectively get better as a whole
[2022-12-11 10:02:34] <unlessthan3> @AriaSaki Do you think there are certain things left out of school curriculums that could impact mental health/parenting?

[2022-12-11 12:09:06] <%thekevboe> i disagree because i feel like clout chasing is a term when you specifically hide your intentions. Like if i was to act lieka friend with the end goal of gaining a following
[2022-12-11 12:09:27] <grooveremotelockjaw> The accusatory "clout chaser" label just strikes me as sublimated envy.

[2022-12-11 13:37:24] <syndromexv> you can't expect people to cherish you as much as you do them
[2022-12-11 13:37:25] <Awesomechad> that sounds like a pretty healthy way to view it
[2022-12-11 13:37:32] <Zerotu14> Kappa
[2022-12-11 13:37:34] <alffine> I think that although that is true, being able to find friendships that lasts for long time is beautiful and that the journey is worth seeking out for people like that

[2022-12-11 13:43:19] <Awesomechad> i wouldn't bother with the response. You already reached out. Thats all they get from you.
[2022-12-11 13:43:24] <%jonno98> Setting a time limit for a response can be very helpful for planning anything

[2022-12-11 13:50:35] <celest_celestial> Life is the consciousness of humanity; it is perception of the world and the universe. So life is sadness; life is death. Life is suffering and destruction. But life is also happiness; life is living. Life is joy and creativity. Life is finding a cause to survive, a reason not to die – not yet. It is youth and old age, with everything in between. Overall, life is beautiful – ugliness is fleeting. Corpses and skeletons are lugubrious; living flesh is resplendent, all bodies are statuesque. Human
