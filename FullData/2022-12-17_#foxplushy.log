First off, I just finished my college semester strong yesterday, which means that I will be editing a lot more than usual. So prepare for a variety of funny, epic, and whacky clips that I will be working on. Secondly, my sweatshirt is coming very soon. I promised that if I bowl a 300 while wearing it, I will reveal my face to the patrons and show the whole game recorded by my sister. Thank you so much for 2 months btw!

I'm not sure if you could bring actual sharp weapons. dull ones, probably. or you could bring some LARP weapons instead.
