[2022-12-11 05:13:59] <quixotic_raconteur> i gotta say, coming into the stream with zero context about what this game is right when charles shows up was really great timing by the universe XD
[2022-12-11 05:14:16] <+Zinriemtv> “Choo-Choo Charles is a very bad train, but you have a machine gun. Good luck.” PC Gamer
[2022-12-11 05:14:18] <+1337Atreyu> Also, pay attention to your train as you upgrade armor. It changes visually
[2022-12-11 05:14:25] <+Zinriemtv> that is written on steam lol
[2022-12-11 05:14:48] <+Silverpslm> I say nuke the train
[2022-12-11 05:14:58] <KittenMask> why wasn't this game nominated for the game awards

[2022-12-11 05:16:41] <leo__nn> i love how soulless and uncanny the human characters look as if theyre anymore inviting than the fucking evil train
[2022-12-11 05:16:43] <AlmostElise> Cultists
[2022-12-11 05:16:52] <pasta_man978> Yea there be a cult
[2022-12-11 05:16:52] <%TheNewSon> seriously though, I believed that this would be just a little meme game, but it's looking pretty legit
[2022-12-11 05:17:10] <alyryk> well he speedily met god
[2022-12-11 05:17:11] <AlmostElise> @thenewson same, i was actually avoiding watching it till now

[2022-12-11 05:17:30] <+Silverpslm> so how again did Charles come to be?
[2022-12-11 05:17:40] <@%+Piccolo113> @TheNewSon Legit, just unfinished? Or are the missing animations intentional?
[2022-12-11 05:18:11] <%$kll21> sup
[2022-12-11 05:18:15] <+1337Atreyu> Game is cut off at the top btw, so we can't see the top of the scrap menu and such
[2022-12-11 05:18:20] <%ITZPOKKET> how are you tonight?
[2022-12-11 05:18:33] <%TheNewSon> @AlmostElise For real, surprised
[2022-12-11 05:18:42] <+LazyInvaderShiya> spoopy Forest
[2022-12-11 05:18:46] <KittenMask> only one way to find out
[2022-12-11 05:18:49] <KittenMask> triSMILERS
[2022-12-11 05:18:59] <+Silverpslm> Was Charles made by a mad scientist? a mad mechanic? a mad biologist? was is birthed by a mother spider train?
[2022-12-11 05:19:09] <+1337Atreyu> NEVERMIND
[2022-12-11 05:19:10] <+1337Atreyu> It's fine
[2022-12-11 05:19:16] <+1337Atreyu> Had an issue with the player
[2022-12-11 05:19:20] <KittenMask> maybe he means chat
[2022-12-11 05:19:20] <Varynova> trainless speedruns when
[2022-12-11 05:19:20] <@%+Piccolo113> You scrolled down a little, huh? LUL
[2022-12-11 05:19:27] <+LazyInvaderShiya> where you zoomed in?
[2022-12-11 05:19:35] <youstink457> why are you on foot with a evil train running around
[2022-12-11 05:19:50] <saggyiguana> Counterstrike?
[2022-12-11 05:19:56] <+Silverpslm> I'm sure eventually you could be autokilled
[2022-12-11 05:20:14] <+1337Atreyu> I can tell you, literally impossible to go trainless
[2022-12-11 05:20:18] <+LazyInvaderShiya> I wonder if scrap is just Charles poop
[2022-12-11 05:20:32] <%TheNewSon> @Piccolo113 I don't know man, but I thought it was going to be kind like a rail shooter. For a game made by what... one guy, a little more? That's way more than I could wish
[2022-12-11 05:20:35] <+Silverpslm> like in village
[2022-12-11 05:20:36] <%$toomanysteamgames> Looks like he has killed all rival trains
[2022-12-11 05:21:02] <%ElementalYoshi> looks like a poor mans captain spalding
[2022-12-11 05:21:16] <+Silverpslm> @toomanysteamgames I would of liked to see the Scorpion Train
[2022-12-11 05:21:20] <@%+Piccolo113> Ok, come on everyone, cut down on the backseating, please. Memey horror game it may be, but the rules against backseating still apply unless Maxy actually asks for help or advice.
[2022-12-11 05:21:25] <+1337Atreyu> lol his chin disappears when he turns his head
[2022-12-11 05:21:33] <%$toomanysteamgames> I'm liking The Duke recast here

[2022-12-11 05:23:03] <+1337Atreyu> The island has evolved beyond the dollar. They just trade in scrap
[2022-12-11 05:23:04] <+Silverpslm> So Satan is the Train Conductor

[2022-12-11 05:28:31] <%ElementalYoshi> orange is cool. But you eat the chili and you might paint your pants brown
[2022-12-11 05:28:45] <%$kll21> is the purple thing on the map charles?
[2022-12-11 05:28:59] <youstink457> music is pretty good in this game
[2022-12-11 05:29:05] <%$toomanysteamgames> Charles is always nearby, in our hearts
[2022-12-11 05:29:13] <%+soccer_whovian> Does Charles come from anywhere or just on the track?
[2022-12-11 05:29:34] <%$toomanysteamgames> @soccer_whovian Charles is a spider now - he has no need for tracks
[2022-12-11 05:29:48] <+1337Atreyu> I've gotta dip for now for my stream
[2022-12-11 05:29:55] <%+soccer_whovian> Oh gotcha I missed that @toomanysteamgames
[2022-12-11 05:30:10] <+1337Atreyu> Good to catch ya though. Hope you like it! I'll try to catch you when my part comes
[2022-12-11 05:30:17] <%$kll21> maxy there was a purple critter on the map with two legs what was that?
[2022-12-11 05:30:53] <+Silverpslm> Since Charles is part spider, does it crawl in tunnels? or hang upside down on trees?
[2022-12-11 05:31:00] <Varynova> they dug too greedily..... and too deep...
[2022-12-11 05:31:17] <+1337Atreyu> If you fail too much, Charles pops out of the chest
[2022-12-11 05:31:28] <+LazyInvaderShiya> more chili
[2022-12-11 05:31:35] <%$kll21> is it the spider or the balrog that is supposed to be really hot?
[2022-12-11 05:31:36] <%ElementalYoshi> we have to at least look at the green.. come on

[2022-12-11 08:09:04] <cynoid> I don't understand this game, how do you beat the boss or get away from him?
[2022-12-11 08:09:56] <@%+eightbitm0nster> well this is the ending. it appears to me as like an on the rails shooter and you just gotta kill him here
[2022-12-11 08:10:05] <kedurki8_> ohh there's a healt bar on the top
[2022-12-11 08:10:16] <%jrustlive> you can do it!
[2022-12-11 08:10:30] <kedurki8_> hard
[2022-12-11 08:10:31] <Aethd> @eightbitm0nster damn this game is on rails?
[2022-12-11 08:10:36] <kedurki8_> NAhh

[2022-12-11 08:11:29] <4D_Hypersphere> Does the rocket launcher reload during cutscenes?

[2022-12-11 08:12:46] <%jrustlive> more health
[2022-12-11 08:13:01] <cynoid> Is it something you're doing wrong? or you just need more upgrades? @Maxylobes
[2022-12-11 08:13:16] <@%+eightbitm0nster> I think more health is the play?
[2022-12-11 08:13:21] <@%+eightbitm0nster> or scrap
[2022-12-11 08:13:40] <%fti_wheerawr> *starcraft voice* you must acquire additional scrap
[2022-12-11 08:13:46] <LLIaMaHa> choo-choo chrales on the rail, choo-choo chrales wouldnt fo to jail, choo-choo charles will play the game, choo-choo charles will gives you pain HypeSquawk
[2022-12-11 08:13:53] <lupus_familiaris> but speeeed...
[2022-12-11 08:13:56] <+LazyInvaderShiya> I saw someone just use the flame thrower the whole time
[2022-12-11 08:14:31] <%tyzula__> hi maxy hi chat!!
[2022-12-11 08:14:33] <howlucky4> I think dist uses it
[2022-12-11 08:14:33] <lupus_familiaris> i'm just curious to see how strats evolve over time. i love wathcing new games gat figured out
[2022-12-11 08:14:35] <+LazyInvaderShiya> they had there levels from top to bottom as 5, 7, 2
[2022-12-11 08:14:38] <+NinoDonDino> yeah it is slow, you have to tab the flamethrower and not perma shoot it
[2022-12-11 08:14:40] <%tyzula__> just joined, are we speedrunning?
[2022-12-11 08:14:43] <howlucky4> but it's because he skips everything else
[2022-12-11 08:14:59] <+LazyInvaderShiya> oh ya talking about dist
[2022-12-11 08:15:33] <%dansto619> f
[2022-12-11 08:15:37] <%tyzula__> oh shit bye old man

[2022-12-11 08:16:36] <+LazyInvaderShiya> we never did find Eugene son right?
[2022-12-11 08:17:06] <Aethd> movement tech in this game looks like it'll eventually get crazy
[2022-12-11 08:17:23] <4D_Hypersphere> He's the guy on the balcony of the arachnaereum or w/e It's called
[2022-12-11 08:18:01] <4D_Hypersphere> Pretty sure? Could just be crazy but I think he says stuff like "It's too bad my Dad couldn't come back with you."
[2022-12-11 08:18:14] <+NicoFnLeon7> are u speedrunning this?
[2022-12-11 08:19:02] <+LazyInvaderShiya> doggo is so passed out on my bed she's snoring loudly
[2022-12-11 08:19:02] <%puptime>* moistB sanxBless pieBully sanxSip howdyWin
[2022-12-11 08:19:38] <+NicoFnLeon7> is it possible to max everything at 100%? (not in a speedrun of course)
[2022-12-11 08:19:47] <+LazyInvaderShiya> he did yes
[2022-12-11 08:20:01] <+lofty_ideals> Wheres choo choo magoo?
[2022-12-11 08:20:37] <Aethd> can't wait for the eventual trainless run
[2022-12-11 08:20:53] <+Ghouldude> choo Chhoo Chuck, Charles' big BIG brother.
[2022-12-11 08:21:30] <+NinoDonDino> Carcinogen played it yesterday trainless, don't know if he did it until the final boss fight or not
[2022-12-11 08:22:25] <Aethd> I just assumed that challenge runners are crazy lol
[2022-12-11 08:22:41] <+LazyInvaderShiya> I don't think it's possible to beat the game without the train cause you gotta use the train at the end
[2022-12-11 08:22:43] <+NinoDonDino> dying must be really bad, if you respawn at your train and have to walk alway again NotLikeThis
[2022-12-11 08:23:43] <cynoid> Is there any way to fight w/o your train? or you still need it for final boss
[2022-12-11 08:23:50] <Aethd> I was just making a joke, because all I know about this game is the ~30 minutes of watching @Maxylobes play it
[2022-12-11 08:23:58] <!MemoriesEmbrace> Maxy and chat peepoShy
[2022-12-11 08:25:32] <!MemoriesEmbrace> I'm good was hanging out with friends in vrchat that why was a bit a late enigmaAYAYA

[2022-12-11 08:28:16] <!MemoriesEmbrace> So what does this game entail? you just drive a train? Hmmm
[2022-12-11 08:28:41] <4D_Hypersphere> Just a nice peaceful train driver :)
[2022-12-11 08:28:56] <4D_Hypersphere> Pay no attention to the rocket launcher mounted on the back

[2022-12-11 08:30:53] <HUNK4> @Aethd yeah, glad it's weekend
[2022-12-11 08:31:10] <+LazyInvaderShiya> you know I don't think burning down the house is gonna work on Charles you should probably just burn down the whole island
[2022-12-11 08:31:55] <Aethd> @LazyInvaderShiya think fire will do it? might need something stronger
[2022-12-11 08:32:10] <HUNK4> @Maxylobes i found this game surprisingly fun and well made

[2022-12-11 08:35:15] <HUNK4> oh i didn't noticed you were speedrunning it, good luck maxy
[2022-12-11 08:35:25] <Aethd> random question, but anyone have any favorite Dungeons and Dragons monsters I should throw at my party tomorrow? sadly train spiders wouldn't fit the setting
[2022-12-11 08:35:59] <HUNK4> @Aethd their lvl's are?
[2022-12-11 08:36:18] <farvarmada> Spectral anything
[2022-12-11 08:36:19] <+LazyInvaderShiya> dist got flamethrower, then just got the eggs and went to finish the game his train levels were 5,7,2
[2022-12-11 08:36:19] <+Ghouldude> @Aethd Pull some from Monster Hunter, there are sheets made for some of them too.
[2022-12-11 08:36:43] <+Caterasan> Are those guys voiced by jerma?

[2022-12-11 08:36:46] <Aethd> @Aethd @HUNK4 10 but they're in a special area where they can't die at the moment so anything works
[2022-12-11 08:36:58] <HUNK4> got it
[2022-12-11 08:37:12] <+LazyInvaderShiya> sorry meant 4,6,1
[2022-12-11 08:37:15] <+Caterasan> I don't know why but they sounded like him just then
[2022-12-11 08:37:16] <Aethd> @Ghouldude not a bad idea, I've seen some of those and they look pretty fun to fight

[2022-12-11 08:39:57] <+Ghouldude> @Aethd Yeah, I hope you enjoy your session, I haven't gotten to play in over a year.
[2022-12-11 08:40:58] <%Aethd> @Ghouldude @Ghouldude sorry to hear that, I miss playing in person, but my group is all online these days. Used to be in 4-5 games pre-pandemic
[2022-12-11 08:40:58] <cynoid> What is the story for the eggs?
[2022-12-11 08:41:11] <HUNK4> @Aethd i think is cool something they feel is killable if they can't die due surprise, so a CR 15 monster mught be ideal, phantom train is an option LUL but void wraith are classics
[2022-12-11 08:41:28] <!%Failmore> failmBigdodo
[2022-12-11 08:41:58] <HUNK4> also young adult red dragon for epic if you feel like it
[2022-12-11 08:42:09] <%Caveman8080> The door squeaking gets me every time.
[2022-12-11 08:43:07] <!%Failmore> i got a 24:04
[2022-12-11 08:43:10] <!MemoriesEmbrace> Why is there an evil spider train PauseChamp
[2022-12-11 08:43:11] <!%Failmore> failmBigdodo
[2022-12-11 08:43:50] <!%Failmore> well you only get the flamethrower....and you dont use the train to much, you more position it for death teleports
[2022-12-11 08:44:03] <+LazyInvaderShiya> if you tap the flamethrower it doesn't overheat I think
[2022-12-11 08:44:09] <HUNK4> @Maxylobes probably rushin eggs and abusing flamethrower stun
[2022-12-11 08:44:22] <!%Failmore> tapping and some scrap for heals
[2022-12-11 08:44:40] <Lets_Go_Raichu> im going to have nightmares tonight rooGlue
[2022-12-11 08:44:48] <HUNK4> btw you move faster without the train maxy, dist said sometthing about that
[2022-12-11 08:44:50] <ToxicWildHog> Who do you main when you play tekken
[2022-12-11 08:45:11] <%Aethd> @HUNK4 yeah Void Wraiths might be appropriate, the current situation is they're stuck on an island where no one can die and it's torture, so inhabitants are starving to death etc
[2022-12-11 08:45:11] <!%Failmore> well heres this if you want to see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eex05iNUNqs&t=3s ...  he is pretty random , sometimes he just destroys
[2022-12-11 08:45:55] <!MemoriesEmbrace> riPepperonis WutFace go away evil spider train
[2022-12-11 08:45:56] <!%Failmore> i had some pretty bad rng in the run, could get 22 or so
[2022-12-11 08:46:01] <!%Failmore> nah, no side stuff
[2022-12-11 08:46:02] <+LazyInvaderShiya> Jesus fight takes like 3-4 mins
[2022-12-11 08:46:55] <+LazyInvaderShiya> and running is really faster then the train?
[2022-12-11 08:46:55] <!%Failmore> yeah i put most of it on low
[2022-12-11 08:47:10] <!%Failmore> running isnt faster than the train, but dieing sure is
[2022-12-11 08:47:20] <cynoid> low graphics and faster train it looks like???
[2022-12-11 08:47:31] <4D_Hypersphere> Train probably has higher velocity but it has to stay on tracks and go in big circles, so beelining on foot and death warping is faster.
[2022-12-11 08:47:58] <!%Failmore> yup
[2022-12-11 08:48:13] <!%Failmore> just damage
[2022-12-11 08:48:35] <!%Failmore> i think that run it got to 6 and i had like 20+ scrap
[2022-12-11 08:48:40] <!%Failmore> crates are random
[2022-12-11 08:49:01] <cynoid> 6 it looks like for dmg
[2022-12-11 08:49:07] <HUNK4> complex choo choo charlie strats LUL
[2022-12-11 08:49:14] <cynoid> 22:28 in vid
[2022-12-11 08:49:26] <%Aethd> powering up with food is best strat
[2022-12-11 08:49:27] <youstink457> the tapping is a great idea
[2022-12-11 08:49:34] <%paranoid_aykroyd> eat and WoS?
[2022-12-11 08:49:44] <HUNK4> btw, didi callisto protocol speedrun got better?
[2022-12-11 08:49:57] <cynoid> Their train seems to be so much faster than yours, the spider is so much further back @Maxylobes
[2022-12-11 08:50:17] <!%Failmore> i dont think you need 6 though, i just ran into a lot of scrap and was forced to take bad lines by random charles
[2022-12-11 08:50:21] <!%Failmore> he also killed me once, lol
[2022-12-11 08:50:30] <+TheUnsungLegion> What did Bittie make tonight?

[2022-12-11 10:09:47] <%mikekillv> So I was reading about this game and I knew this game took inspiration from Thomas The Tank Engine but I guess it was also inspired by a Stephen King kids book called Charlie the Choo Choo
[2022-12-11 10:10:31] <Narratorway> Fella seems a lil off center...
[2022-12-11 10:10:36] <+NymRydor> Stephen King the legend

[2022-12-11 10:19:50] <!%Failmore> around it
[2022-12-11 10:20:06] <IngameAsylum> I don't know if you know yet, but you can zoom into the map and actually see scrap. Hard to see, but it looks like 2 yellow dots
[2022-12-11 10:20:13] <IngameAsylum> And hello :D
[2022-12-11 10:20:21] <IngameAsylum> Yes

[2022-12-11 10:20:33] <IngameAsylum> It's hard to see, but it may help with planning routes

[2022-12-11 10:22:54] <IngameAsylum> I'm not sure if crates do. I've not searched.
[2022-12-11 10:23:28] <IngameAsylum> There are two there on that bridge
[2022-12-11 10:23:32] <IngameAsylum> I dunno if you saw them

[2022-12-11 10:24:52] <%dansto619> that was the barn no?

[2022-12-11 10:26:52] <00OD> i love a one-dev game with some experimental gameplay
[2022-12-11 10:26:53] <xandurr> i hope the game eventually gets a higher difficulty option, a lot of players have been complaining about the game being boring and it's mainly due to the charles encounters being too sparse
[2022-12-11 10:27:29] <IngameAsylum> Also, the game usually looks better than this. I'm assuming Maxy dropped all the visual settings to get better frames.
[2022-12-11 10:27:36] <crimboh> eugene noooo
[2022-12-11 10:27:47] <IngameAsylum> haha nice

[2022-12-11 10:29:00] <%dansto619> that npc gives the key no?
[2022-12-11 10:29:11] <IngameAsylum> Oh, I think the guy at that house gives you the key @Maxylobes
[2022-12-11 10:29:18] <IngameAsylum> The house you passed up to get to this barn
[2022-12-11 10:29:32] <IngameAsylum> I believe so
[2022-12-11 10:29:40] <RhetoricaIAnswer> yeah the review I saw was rather pretentious and seemed like he was taking this game way too seriously
[2022-12-11 10:30:17] <IngameAsylum> that's decent haha
[2022-12-11 10:30:23] <plaguedust22> Those boxes of scraps are hella random I think

[2022-12-11 10:35:34] <SchizophrenicDerek> When you’re being paid to play a game it can become your are being forced to play this game
[2022-12-11 10:35:47] <mashtriangle> I just think the scoring metric is out of whack -- a 7.5 is considered "bad" or "average" in high-end outlets
[2022-12-11 10:36:04] <SchizophrenicDerek> ^
[2022-12-11 10:36:04] <mashtriangle> exactly, they take it out on the whole outlet and not just the one reviewer's opinion
[2022-12-11 10:36:12] <antsbit> can you up the graphics settings
[2022-12-11 10:36:23] <plaguedust22> 7.5 ain't bad. Excuse me LUL
[2022-12-11 10:36:43] <SchizophrenicDerek> I write reviews, people ask me to give a grade at the end but I won’t because it is so misleading

[2022-12-11 11:33:33] <youstink457> why didn't you stop and say hi to Barry
[2022-12-11 11:33:47] <Quioraa> is this trainless%?
[2022-12-11 11:33:55] <nGsJason> so the crates are just RNG?
[2022-12-11 11:34:24] <mudkip009> trainless%
[2022-12-11 11:35:17] <youstink457> will a no damage run will be impossible
[2022-12-11 11:35:53] <nGsJason> DA manip clearly NODDERS
[2022-12-11 11:36:01] <searin23> they chase you pretty far it seems
[2022-12-11 11:36:38] <nGsJason> it genuinely looks like running is faster than the train lol

[2022-12-11 11:37:05] <nGsJason> makes sense
[2022-12-11 11:39:12] <%GRoWlLiX> are those the lowest settings?
[2022-12-11 11:39:22] <Juba60> what is this game about?
[2022-12-11 11:40:34] <RhetoricaIAnswer> you must train so that you may train better than train!
[2022-12-11 11:40:46] <HUNK4> i see, this game is a choochoolike
[2022-12-11 11:41:03] <%Zeph43> If you were a train what color would you be Hmmm
[2022-12-11 11:41:28] <RhetoricaIAnswer> @HUNK4 more of a metroidtrainia
[2022-12-11 11:41:30] <+BigDilGamer> Blue all the way
[2022-12-11 11:41:43] <%GRoWlLiX> i remember having a rainbow six on cd as a kid idk wich one tho but yeah the game looked like that xD
[2022-12-11 11:41:55] <nGsJason> I went back and played R6 3 I think a few years back
[2022-12-11 11:42:09] <nGsJason> lmao
[2022-12-11 11:42:38] <RhetoricaIAnswer> aged like milk... mmmm cheese
[2022-12-11 11:42:46] <+Ruby_Rhodd> tasty chewy past games
[2022-12-11 11:42:46] <nGsJason> it's still so hard and you have to play so tactical
[2022-12-11 11:43:16] <lHereticRamzal> if your operatives dies... they're perma dead LUL
[2022-12-11 11:43:41] <+stefanehj> i remember this
[2022-12-11 11:43:50] <nGsJason> R6 3 gold was on steam and my friend and I thought it would be funny to try playing a co-op mission again lol
[2022-12-11 11:44:04] <nGsJason> it was SO hard

[2022-12-11 11:44:57] <lHereticRamzal> cuz i wont get past the first level
[2022-12-11 11:45:23] <nGsJason> R6 Vegas is still fun tho
[2022-12-11 11:45:31] <lHereticRamzal> game was made for you to think carefully
[2022-12-11 11:46:22] <lHereticRamzal> the rainbowsix now is far away from that methodology
[2022-12-11 11:46:32] <Quioraa> Vegas was good, I played that in between playing Splinter Cell and SC: Chaos Theory
[2022-12-11 11:47:29] <@%H1pp0__> personally couldn't get into early rainbow six and ghost recon games. but splinter cell always stood out as the best tom clancy game
[2022-12-11 11:47:36] <nGsJason> ok so I'm kinda curious, is there a benefit to low settings in this game?
[2022-12-11 11:48:00] <Quioraa> agreed
[2022-12-11 11:48:09] <nGsJason> or is it something as simple as visibility/FPS?
[2022-12-11 11:48:30] <%GRoWlLiX> is it just me or does twitch lower the stream quality if its not focused
[2022-12-11 11:49:28] <%GRoWlLiX> saving bandwith i assume
[2022-12-11 11:50:30] <cranksam> mhh, he's not wrong z0mThink
[2022-12-11 11:52:56] <nGsJason> did they patch the thing where tapping it keeps Charles stunned/back?
[2022-12-11 11:53:14] <+K1LL3Y> Surely soon there'll be a way to clip into that room where you spawn to hell?
[2022-12-11 11:53:44] <+K1LL3Y> Ah okay, makes sense!
[2022-12-11 11:54:50] <@%H1pp0__> KEKWHD
[2022-12-11 11:56:07] <nGsJason> It looks like the flamethrower is just overheating a bunch of something
[2022-12-11 11:56:29] <searin23> would some sort of speed or defense help balance charles a little?
[2022-12-11 11:56:43] <Ghoulgott> everybody loves RNG in boss battles barbOK
[2022-12-11 11:56:49] <searin23> or at least make it more consistent
[2022-12-11 11:57:20] <searin23> fair nough
[2022-12-11 11:57:50] <%Zeph43> imagine going slow LUL
[2022-12-11 11:58:42] <%Zeph43> as he's dying he's still trying to help Sadge
[2022-12-11 11:58:51] <nGsJason> it's also curious how much each damage actually saves in time.
[2022-12-11 11:59:09] <+DuXeNMX> he will be missed... for another 20 min...
[2022-12-11 11:59:17] <nikita_bullet> Is it collisto protocol speedrun?
[2022-12-11 11:59:26] <%Zeph43> ghost riding the whip EZ
[2022-12-11 11:59:49] <nGsJason> like if you only got 7 instead of 8 how much does that lose for example
[2022-12-11 11:59:56] <%+ChefMannie> i mean spider train might as well be in space
[2022-12-11 11:59:57] <CodyTheGod> its train vrs spider train from hell

[2022-12-11 12:02:24] <@%H1pp0__> any new skips since last run of callisto ?
[2022-12-11 12:02:27] <nikita_bullet> I saw your Collisto protocol walkthrough. Seemed like you didn't like the game much LUL
[2022-12-11 12:02:35] <aspect_sn0wz> Hello
[2022-12-11 12:02:46] <CodyTheGod> I remember someone is believed took the dev's name and pretending to be them its unclear because the account was made 13mins ago when they where talking in a different stream
[2022-12-11 12:02:50] <nGsJason> hippo there is one right at the start that saves like 10 min
[2022-12-11 12:02:54] <x_reyz> is this game well optimize?
[2022-12-11 12:02:55] <nGsJason> lmao

[2022-12-11 12:10:24] <%+Marrickfait> I was gonna say Fear too yea
[2022-12-11 12:10:47] <+Magical_2HU_Girl> Really disappointed in this game. Really falls short in the fact that the developer wasn't smart enough to commission Crazy Train from Ozzy Osbourne as a boss theme. /s
[2022-12-11 12:11:28] <CodyTheGod> the coolest skip is the gate skip in fear 1
[2022-12-11 12:11:32] <nGsJason> like the lag ones by tabbing in and out after getting hit or w/e

[2022-12-11 12:13:47] <+Magical_2HU_Girl> Man companies just seem to have walked away in general. I know a streamer who watched the entirety of Attack On Titan, streamed from Crunchyroll, and nobody batted an eyelid.

[2022-12-11 12:16:39] <+Magical_2HU_Girl> @nGsJason I agree, but the point is if it was during the DMCA hell era, they would have have been banned. Due to it being streamed recently, companies don't really care to check now.

[2022-12-11 12:37:03] <TheTrigen> Hello trigenSure
[2022-12-11 12:37:20] <TheTrigen> I did not follow while you speedrun Calisto protocol but twitch is giving me your stream again so here I am
[2022-12-11 12:38:04] <sasa_gamer09> Hi
[2022-12-11 12:38:28] <Slaydahrd> you're in my recommended and here i am
[2022-12-11 12:38:30] <DennisTheMenace99> I found you by watching the re8 speed runs
[2022-12-11 12:38:31] <CodyTheGod> i found your youtube thru recommendeds
[2022-12-11 12:38:40] <sasa_gamer09> Hello
[2022-12-11 12:38:42] <TheTrigen> is this game good ? :D
[2022-12-11 12:38:55] <sasa_gamer09> Yea
[2022-12-11 12:39:02] <TheTrigen> I played village for first time yesterday :D
[2022-12-11 12:39:17] <TheTrigen> I though its fully only about the vampire mommy
[2022-12-11 12:39:21] <TheTrigen> and It was not
[2022-12-11 12:39:25] <+NinoDonDino> Kreygasm Crate RNGsus
[2022-12-11 12:39:42] <SpookyGibberish> can you toot the train horn
[2022-12-11 12:40:13] <%+Marrickfait> Was Elden Ring your GotY or did you have Ragnarok over it?
[2022-12-11 12:40:50] <BusySummoningMelina> Toot toot 🚂
[2022-12-11 12:41:07] <sasa_gamer09> He is scarry
[2022-12-11 12:41:19] <lHereticRamzal> if elden ring people will say "skill issue" i would say ragnarok is a "purchase issue"
[2022-12-11 12:41:21] <+Magical_2HU_Girl> Do you agree with Ragnarok beating Metal: Hellsinger for best soundtrack? (I'm salty I just want somebody to agree)
[2022-12-11 12:41:47] <%+Marrickfait> Oh nice! Pretty refreshing hearing people not giving those games a 10/10 all the time
[2022-12-11 12:42:09] <sasa_gamer09> What is the world record for this game
[2022-12-11 12:42:32] <%+Marrickfait> Ragnarok has the same issue with soundtrack as Marvel movies. We can't remember anything but hte main theme when it is over lol
[2022-12-11 12:42:37] <Heretikki> @Magical_2HU_Girl i agree
[2022-12-11 12:42:41] <CodyTheGod> GoW had the music done to a teaa
[2022-12-11 12:42:56] <Quioraa> metal hellsinger has a great ost but it's also context dependant. if you're not not a metal head, it's kinda lost on people imo
[2022-12-11 12:42:57] <Lolypopss> imo Plague Tale had better sound that GoW
[2022-12-11 12:43:02] <+bfuqua55> dont think there is a set WR yet since this game just came out @sasa_gamer09
[2022-12-11 12:43:20] <SpookyGibberish> runs are probably locked for 2 weeks right?
[2022-12-11 12:43:35] <SpookyGibberish> dist got 25 minutes and something yesterday though
[2022-12-11 12:43:50] <cypher987097> ji
[2022-12-11 12:43:54] <cypher987097> hi
[2022-12-11 12:43:54] <fullwildline> eldenring buckethead edition, when? LUL
[2022-12-11 12:44:03] <SpookyGibberish> oh I just assumed every new game gets locked for a short period after launch
[2022-12-11 12:44:03] <%+Marrickfait> Do you think you'll give Dead Space Remake a speedrun chance after getting your fill of it?
[2022-12-11 12:44:19] <+Magical_2HU_Girl> Like personally I have an issue with GoW winning at TGA. There should be a rule where a game has a release date per nomination cut-off. GoW was out for 29 days before TGA and swept. I might be alone but the same thing happens every year and I feel it's disgusting and unfair to every game that came out over the course of those 11 months.
[2022-12-11 12:44:25] <SpookyGibberish> full damage run?
[2022-12-11 12:44:32] <+Magical_2HU_Girl> Not taking away from GoW's quality though
[2022-12-11 12:44:59] <%+Marrickfait> There is a cut off date for Nominations lol. God of War Ragnarok just beat it
[2022-12-11 12:45:25] <CodyTheGod> true about Elden Ring
[2022-12-11 12:45:33] <paytar0> 1 year isn't enough time to build a game to compete with god of war
[2022-12-11 12:46:05] <%+Marrickfait> Next year sounds STACKED for potential GotY nominees.
[2022-12-11 12:46:36] <paytar0> game development takes so long now a days that a cutoff wouldn't do much except maybe just secure the winning spots early in the year
[2022-12-11 12:46:40] <Frookie12> this run looks scrappy LUL
[2022-12-11 12:46:44] <+Remersion> If a game comes out to late for it to be in the game awards does that mean it doesn't qualify for next year cause it technically didn't come out that year?
[2022-12-11 12:47:17] <TheTrigen> I love how you just dont care and run... It have to be awful from their pov.. He just commin for the eggs and nothing can stop him
[2022-12-11 12:47:23] <SpookyGibberish> I think rethinking security is Geoffs top priority atm LUL
[2022-12-11 12:47:25] <lHereticRamzal> IMO GotY contenders should have a 4month incubation period before they can get nominated as a GotY contendr
[2022-12-11 12:47:33] <+Remersion> Sounds like a super rare case for sure
[2022-12-11 12:47:51] <%SacredLegion2> I think it just goes into next years pool. But other games come out that year as well so its harder for it to stay relevant.
[2022-12-11 12:47:54] <djndbebe> bro I'm knew
[2022-12-11 12:48:10] <+Ruby_Rhodd> damage level 9, zero heal run
[2022-12-11 12:48:11] <%+Marrickfait> Hoping that RE4 Remake is good enough for nomination next year...
[2022-12-11 12:48:16] <Quioraa> I was surprised to see Plague Tale be nominated for a bunch of stuff too, not to hate on the game, just feel like too short of a time window for it
[2022-12-11 12:48:20] <djndbebe> I like your streams
[2022-12-11 12:48:42] <TheTrigen> lets burn the lava train
[2022-12-11 12:48:57] <CodyTheGod> elaBless Charles be kind
[2022-12-11 12:49:10] <+Magical_2HU_Girl> Like the question is, if GoW for example missed the cut off, would it win or lose to the next AAA game that barely made it's cut off date and releases days before TGA.
[2022-12-11 12:49:17] <+Magical_2HU_Girl> Because I'd say it loses, personally.
[2022-12-11 12:49:43] <SpookyGibberish> depends on the quality of the game that barely makes the cut off date
[2022-12-11 12:49:51] <SpookyGibberish> it's quality vs quality
[2022-12-11 12:49:59] <SpookyGibberish> no matter when it got entered
[2022-12-11 12:50:29] <+Magical_2HU_Girl> I'd agree and disagree and say it's hype VS memorability.

[2022-12-11 12:58:24] <Dallou> Howdy enigmaHowdy What's the current WR for this game already?
[2022-12-11 12:59:04] <@%H1pp0__> i do wonder what would happen if you kill charles before hand Hmmm
[2022-12-11 12:59:45] <+Magical_2HU_Girl> Like kill him in the opening sequence?
[2022-12-11 12:59:54] <@%H1pp0__> pretty much. you'd need cheat engine
[2022-12-11 12:59:59] <+Magical_2HU_Girl> It looks like it's timed or he has a set disengage value
[2022-12-11 13:00:52] <Dallou> Debating on grabbing this or not enigmaHmm
[2022-12-11 13:01:53] <Dallou> Yeah I heard its avg about 2-3 hours
[2022-12-11 13:01:56] <Grognosh2> I think 20 bucks is slightly too much
[2022-12-11 13:03:13] <SpookyGibberish> 20$ is fair for an indie game made by 1 dude imo

[2022-12-11 13:05:03] <+Magical_2HU_Girl> Reset
[2022-12-11 13:05:08] <+Magical_2HU_Girl> Or die

Glitching is cheating and if you don't stop glitching I'm gonna call the glitch police.

[2022-12-11 13:46:17] <+NinoDonDino> maxy definitely is getting his money worth
[2022-12-11 13:46:44] <+HuskySmallz> did you see their remaking dead space for ps5
[2022-12-11 13:47:58] <+HuskySmallz> imo that protocol game brought the sale scheme about
[2022-12-11 13:49:25] <paytar0> now is it a reboot or remaster?
[2022-12-11 13:49:30] <+HuskySmallz> I hope its different but still scary af
[2022-12-11 13:49:31] <SpookyGibberish> sale scheme?
[2022-12-11 13:49:39] <%+Marrickfait> Are you more excited for SH2, Rem4ke, or Dead Space Remake?
[2022-12-11 13:50:03] <+Magical_2HU_Girl> RE4 for real, I can't wait to see more
[2022-12-11 13:50:11] <fullwildline> RE4 remake GOTY confirmed
[2022-12-11 13:50:29] <%+Marrickfait> Apparently a demo happening in january, but you know... leaks, never believe them till they happen
[2022-12-11 13:50:31] <myndgamez_> scrap in crate rng based?
[2022-12-11 13:50:34] <+Magical_2HU_Girl> I just hope they don]t cut 40% of the game
[2022-12-11 13:50:39] <PlayingOnBacon> don't remake mean it's gonna have total different things from the original
[2022-12-11 13:50:52] <+NinoDonDino> if anything, i think callisto protocol made people more hyped for Dead Space Remake, because Callisto was by far not as good as people hope it would be
[2022-12-11 13:51:23] <PlayingOnBacon> ahhhh okay
[2022-12-11 13:51:31] <quantic_gamble> Godamn i love RE4
[2022-12-11 13:51:40] <my5teryb0x> f
[2022-12-11 13:51:48] <SpookyGibberish> can't wait to see the new silent hill game tbh
[2022-12-11 13:51:53] <paytar0> they better not fuck up the audio. thats what made dead space special to me
[2022-12-11 13:52:00] <+NinoDonDino> Remake baiscally means that they took the original and remake the whole game the way it was, but redo everything
[2022-12-11 13:52:03] <Cindorian> Ah damn
[2022-12-11 13:52:05] <+Magical_2HU_Girl> Oh lawd he hootin
[2022-12-11 13:52:11] <%+Marrickfait> Re1 Remake the best remake in gaming imo.
[2022-12-11 13:52:17] <krackersk2> Oh Charles.
[2022-12-11 13:52:22] <+NinoDonDino> a remaster would just be stuff like better resolution, better textures etc
[2022-12-11 13:52:23] <myndgamez_> They need Samuel Jackson VA saying 'choo choo mutha fucka' as hes chasing you
[2022-12-11 13:53:00] <mkgdx> heh, wouldn't be a surprise to see someone make that into a mod
[2022-12-11 13:53:24] <avelxic> ff7 dont forgor, if u want to mention abt the sample
[2022-12-11 13:53:44] <%+Marrickfait> @avelxic FF7 is barely a remake lol.
[2022-12-11 13:54:25] <%+Marrickfait> Are there any bosses you don't want to see remade in RE4?
[2022-12-11 13:54:31] <%GRoWlLiX> @mkgdx instead of charles they should mod thomas the tank engine with the theme in this game
[2022-12-11 13:54:49] <noriken> thomas the tank with spider legs
[2022-12-11 13:54:50] <+HuskySmallz> they should put the dead space 2 pvp on dead space 1 that'd be dope
[2022-12-11 13:54:55] <noriken> that's a mental image i didn't need
[2022-12-11 13:55:08] <%archer0reflex> That sounds like the RE2 music
[2022-12-11 13:55:13] <+Magical_2HU_Girl> For the RE4 remake, the fact it's been in development for so long, supposedly, gives me hope that they are not cutting content, and that gives me hope they are rather adding things to it.
[2022-12-11 13:55:20] <%+Marrickfait> We really need a gameplay demo for SH2.
[2022-12-11 13:55:31] <%+Marrickfait> LOL
[2022-12-11 13:55:50] <%+Marrickfait> A lot of people say U3 but I agree with you
[2022-12-11 13:56:18] <dav_the_hat_man> Just make the giant salamander into a cutscene
[2022-12-11 13:56:27] <dav_the_hat_man> No fight all cinematic
[2022-12-11 13:56:50] <%+Marrickfait> Turn Del Lago into the Alligator Fight from RE2 remake lol
[2022-12-11 13:57:17] <%+Marrickfait> I agree 100%, and U3 has a cool design and is... intimidating in phase 2
[2022-12-11 13:57:19] <krackersk2> It's a Fishing minigame
[2022-12-11 13:57:48] <Bucits> what is the best boss in re?

[2022-12-11 14:22:16] <DriverBen> When I saw gameplay for it I was speechless.
[2022-12-11 14:22:16] <Katenkiokotsu> it came so out of nowhere
[2022-12-11 14:22:18] <noriken> surely it will be fun...
[2022-12-11 14:22:19] <%+SaintNick2> what a different direction to go in
[2022-12-11 14:22:24] <Katenkiokotsu> @Magical_2HU_Girl yes
[2022-12-11 14:22:44] <Katenkiokotsu> @Magical_2HU_Girl we play as a young Cereza and Chesire
[2022-12-11 14:22:54] <+Magical_2HU_Girl> Wait I had no idea about this what the hell is this
[2022-12-11 14:23:01] <DriverBen> They probably wanted something that would actually work on the Switch
[2022-12-11 14:23:04] <+Magical_2HU_Girl> Imma brb I'm looking at the trailer
[2022-12-11 14:23:14] <Katenkiokotsu> @Magical_2HU_Girl the Game Awards my dude
[2022-12-11 14:23:26] <+Magical_2HU_Girl> Ohhhh, yeah, Maxy you know how I feel about TGA. I didn't watch it. Love Geoff though.
[2022-12-11 14:24:20] <Cindorian> Oh god don't tell it harder Kreygasm
[2022-12-11 14:24:27] <dav_the_hat_man> Shoot me harder
[2022-12-11 14:24:27] <MasterDragul> stop trying to shoot me and shoot me eogNo
[2022-12-11 14:25:28] <Katenkiokotsu> sounds like a Nicholas Cage quote or at least it does in my head lol
[2022-12-11 14:25:29] <noriken> @Magical_2HU_Girl i just watch it for the trailers
[2022-12-11 14:25:37] <%+GaretFarendan> Wasn't that from Borderlands 2? Shooty mc shootface or something like that? This weird NPC that wanted to be shot in the face.
[2022-12-11 14:25:48] <krackersk2> Morpheus :)
[2022-12-11 14:25:56] <noriken> i usually skip TGA's but i'm glad i didn't this year
[2022-12-11 14:26:18] <noriken> that ARMORED CORE VI announcement; i'm still excited over it
[2022-12-11 14:26:21] <Katenkiokotsu> yeah the awards part of the game awards it's bullshit, but the trailers are sometimes good
[2022-12-11 14:26:27] <dav_the_hat_man> Armored Core 6 was like the one announcement to interest me
[2022-12-11 14:26:29] <Katenkiokotsu> unless everything has been leaked out lol
[2022-12-11 14:26:45] [Announcement] <StreamElements> Maxy is partnered with LogitechG! He uses a G915 Keyboard and G502 Mouse. Please use Max's link and code, Maxylobes, before making a purchase on LogitechG's Website! https://imp.i125364.net/6JGVr maxyyWoo
[2022-12-11 14:26:57] <%RPD_CHAMBERS> cantaHi
[2022-12-11 14:26:58] <+Magical_2HU_Girl> Okay so Bayo Origins is uh... Different, for Platinum.
[2022-12-11 14:26:59] <krackersk2> One of the best side quests Garet, never fails to make me laugh
[2022-12-11 14:27:13] <noriken> honestly..i forgot everything outside of armored core
[2022-12-11 14:27:16] <%+GaretFarendan> I just love the memes that were spawned by TGA. LUL
[2022-12-11 14:27:16] <noriken> oh right hades 2
[2022-12-11 14:27:23] <mhig48> love the game
[2022-12-11 14:27:30] <CodyTheGod> the best part of the awards show was that Bill Clinton has done rehab
[2022-12-11 14:27:53] <Katenkiokotsu> Bisexual hell 2 @noriken that looks interesting, and if it's just the same game again at least gameplay would be fun
[2022-12-11 14:27:59] <mhig48> CHOO CHOO CHARLES
[2022-12-11 14:28:23] <noriken> our patience has been rwarded
[2022-12-11 14:28:27] <Katenkiokotsu> @Magical_2HU_Girl it looks like a puzzle platfomer game
[2022-12-11 14:28:28] <%+Marrickfait> I'm surpised it was such a large announcement since the series doesn't exactly have high marks in regards to critical reception lol
[2022-12-11 14:28:48] <noriken> oh right judas i forgot about that
[2022-12-11 14:28:59] <+NinoDonDino> are you interested in "atomic heart" ?
[2022-12-11 14:29:04] <noriken> oh right death stranding 2
[2022-12-11 14:29:06] <SpookyGibberish> judas looks sick af
[2022-12-11 14:29:07] <Katenkiokotsu> oh yeah
[2022-12-11 14:29:08] <+NinoDonDino> Crime Boss
[2022-12-11 14:29:08] <p0uet> Boss something
[2022-12-11 14:29:15] <taupesauce63194> The Darkness?
[2022-12-11 14:29:16] <noriken> Rockay City
[2022-12-11 14:29:24] <Katenkiokotsu> @NinoDonDino THAT'S IT
[2022-12-11 14:29:35] <mhig48> CHOO
[2022-12-11 14:29:36] <Katenkiokotsu> might just play it just because of the memes lol
[2022-12-11 14:29:40] <krackersk2> Oh yeeaah that game was stacked with big names
[2022-12-11 14:29:54] <mhig48> CHOO CHARLES GO CHOO CHOO
[2022-12-11 14:30:07] <SpookyGibberish> games with stacked names I'm super wary of
[2022-12-11 14:30:11] <Katenkiokotsu> Judas could be what Bioshock 3 was supposed to be so that could be cool
[2022-12-11 14:30:20] <taupesauce63194> I thought it was The Darkness but no it’s probably not
[2022-12-11 14:30:25] <noriken> the FF XVI trailer though...
[2022-12-11 14:30:27] <Katenkiokotsu> I liked Death stranding but it was just so weird
[2022-12-11 14:30:37] <SpookyGibberish> kind of wondering about how bioshock 4 will be without ken levine since he's making judas instead
[2022-12-11 14:30:48] <+NinoDonDino> Game Awards had so many good announcements
[2022-12-11 14:30:50] <noriken> oh right remnant 2 was a thing too
[2022-12-11 14:30:56] <+NinoDonDino> 2023 seems really packed for me
[2022-12-11 14:30:59] <@%H1pp0__> SUSSY
[2022-12-11 14:31:09] <Katenkiokotsu> @noriken FFXVI trailers have been really good so far but i'm not sold on the combat
[2022-12-11 14:31:25] <noriken> @Katenkiokotsu i have faith in Yoshi-P

[2022-12-11 14:33:34] <+Magical_2HU_Girl> I'm gonna suplex your trains.

[2022-12-11 14:34:00] <noriken> it just comes across as "future fedex man" the game to me

[2022-12-11 14:36:14] <+Muhmed2> @magical_2hu_girl what is 3 sugars?
[2022-12-11 14:36:19] <SpookyGibberish> it looked super weird for a transformers game
[2022-12-11 14:36:20] <noriken> but >splash damage
[2022-12-11 14:36:36] <krackersk2> 1 more than 2 sugars
[2022-12-11 14:36:40] <noriken> to be fair @SpookyGibberish the last game i can think of that developer made was Brink
[2022-12-11 14:36:41] <+Magical_2HU_Girl> 3 teaspoons of granulated sugar. I'm Irish, so your tea is different to my tea.

[2022-12-11 14:36:55] <SpookyGibberish> @noriken the transformers game director?
[2022-12-11 14:37:02] <SpookyGibberish> didn't brink bomb? LUL
[2022-12-11 14:37:05] <noriken> developer splash damage
[2022-12-11 14:37:09] <lastinout> is the speed upgrade not useful for the speedrun?
[2022-12-11 14:37:18] <noriken> yeah it bombed pretty hard
[2022-12-11 14:37:23] <noriken> for how hyped up it was
[2022-12-11 14:37:33] <SpookyGibberish> alot of the transformers games have been mediocre anyways so
[2022-12-11 14:37:39] <+Havrrics> Kinda crazy, you were playing this before I went to bed this morning and almost six hours later here you are, still going at it
[2022-12-11 14:38:02] <SpookyGibberish> honestly they should just make a transformers game akin to war of the monsters for ps2 imo
[2022-12-11 14:38:04] <+kindfoxtv> Hey Maxi! It feels weird seeing you live at this hours
[2022-12-11 14:38:11] <taupesauce63194> Not Super Charles

[2022-12-11 14:41:12] <Katenkiokotsu> @DontAskJeremy maybe? i don't know what that clown posse is tho
[2022-12-11 14:41:42] <%+DontAskJeremy> @Katenkiokotsu They were a musical group, maybe still are? Many years ago in a place called "The 90s"
[2022-12-11 14:42:24] <Katenkiokotsu> "THE 90s" THAT'S INSANE

[2022-12-11 14:49:08] <secondchanceq8> Yo maxy, how’s the game? Is it worth getting?
[2022-12-11 14:49:30] <SpookyGibberish> oh no

[2022-12-11 14:50:22] <SpookyGibberish> missed scrap :(
[2022-12-11 14:50:28] <Cindorian> Does fighting Charles put scrap in your inventory
[2022-12-11 14:50:53] <SpookyGibberish> you walked right over it by a tree
[2022-12-11 14:51:16] <my5teryb0x> die from the rocket launcher dynamite
[2022-12-11 14:51:21] <SpookyGibberish> fall damage
[2022-12-11 14:51:25] <my5teryb0x> oh yeah fall damage
[2022-12-11 14:51:37] <SpookyGibberish> B)

[2022-12-11 14:52:48] <SpookyGibberish> omg charles just went up that hill monkaSHAKE
[2022-12-11 14:53:14] <SpookyGibberish> yes
[2022-12-11 14:53:26] <DriverBen> I just imagine Charles running around following you, hiding behind small tree's
[2022-12-11 14:53:36] <DriverBen> "you can't see me!"
[2022-12-11 14:53:44] <SpookyGibberish> what if charles was a trapdoor spider
[2022-12-11 14:53:44] <+WitchHat> Mhhh.. do I have to imagine this as Trainlien: Isolation? With a train constantly stalking you?
[2022-12-11 14:53:47] <SpookyGibberish> that'd be dope af

[2022-12-11 14:54:52] <SpookyGibberish> charlie knows the route his AI adapts
[2022-12-11 14:55:01] <FullCitris> Is speedrunning this game just rng from charles?
[2022-12-11 14:55:04] <+majimapilled> i love these runs its fun to listen to in the background while i read manga :)
[2022-12-11 14:55:10] <MasterDragul> that death wrap though 👀
[2022-12-11 14:55:28] <SpookyGibberish> yeah I know I was just messin
[2022-12-11 14:55:36] <BIOkassin> game itself is fun but as a speedrun game thats super bad, so much rng
[2022-12-11 14:55:46] <lHereticRamzal> idk RNG speedruns are more fun to watch than Calculated ones
[2022-12-11 14:55:51] <SpookyGibberish> sub 20 run will be GOD rng
[2022-12-11 14:56:10] <fullwildline> i just dont like RNG its just not my music, maybe some Tony Braxton, buts thats the most i  would go
[2022-12-11 14:56:11] <TheLoco> At least is a 20 min speedrun
[2022-12-11 14:56:35] <BIOkassin> old man Sadge

[2022-12-11 14:57:42] <DriverBen> You get to drive a train.. how many games let you drive a train? A train with guns nonetheless
[2022-12-11 14:57:56] <SpookyGibberish> we will avenge Eugene in 30 minutes or less or his money back

[2022-12-11 14:58:40] <%+DontAskJeremy> I liked Spirit Tracks
[2022-12-11 14:58:45] <FullCitris> Spirit tracks was cool
[2022-12-11 14:58:47] <SpookyGibberish> robbing the train is much more fun
[2022-12-11 14:58:48] <DriverBen> I was like "sweet, a train!" 10mins later... "Well this is boring"

[2022-12-11 14:59:13] <%+DontAskJeremy> It was an accompaniment to Phantom Hour Glass
[2022-12-11 14:59:31] <%+DontAskJeremy> The animation was similar to Wind Waker

[2022-12-11 15:00:35] <Cindorian> Charles has the "tentacles" for that job
[2022-12-11 15:00:48] <DriverBen> Charles lays out scrap for Maxy. Maxy: "Ooh, piece of candy! Ooh, piece of candy!"
[2022-12-11 15:00:59] <SpookyGibberish> lvl 1 train run, you just get scrap to heal. LUL
[2022-12-11 15:01:03] <+hack_chirac> might be a good thing to be pre-hurt with fall damage juste enough to get killed faster?
[2022-12-11 15:01:11] <+HuskySmallz> it's Sunday...
[2022-12-11 15:01:16] <MasterDragul> would that even be possible? no healing, no upgrades sounds like hell LUL
[2022-12-11 15:01:32] <SpookyGibberish> i don't think 0 scrap run is possible
[2022-12-11 15:01:52] <+HuskySmallz> ok still Saturday

[2022-12-11 15:10:35] <+Magical_2HU_Girl> But BTTV gives you the Audio Compressor option which increases volume.
[2022-12-11 15:10:49] <SpookyGibberish> I use both fine
[2022-12-11 15:11:11] <lHereticRamzal> but hey you dont need to pay BTTV and 7TV if u have them both active... BTTV is just extra emote slots
[2022-12-11 15:11:17] <+thee_wall> Is this on low settings? Or just looks different from how I saw it yesterday? LUL
[2022-12-11 15:11:21] <KonShika> use ffz then, and then you can use all emotes @Magical_2HU_Girl

[2022-12-11 15:32:32] <Grognosh2> Charles isn't really a bad guy. He is just misunderstood
[2022-12-11 15:32:50] <MasterDragul> would the train whistle alert charles?

[2022-12-11 15:33:33] <+Magical_2HU_Girl> Just because Charles is a bad guy, doesn't mean he's a "Bad Guy"

[2022-12-11 15:41:04] <+Magical_2HU_Girl> It's funny, I spend dozens of hours a week on twitch, and yet when I'm sat in work, looking for something to watch I always forget about twitch streamer vods. (I can't access my subscriptions)
[2022-12-11 15:41:14] <Krabbykitty> Importante you say? Lol
[2022-12-11 15:41:18] <@%H1pp0__> you gonna do the wide open mouth face, with charles in the background, video title 'choo choo charles is a scary speedrun' ?

[2022-12-11 15:43:06] <+Magical_2HU_Girl> Maxy, have you played Krampus Kills?
[2022-12-11 15:43:44] <%De_cloud> You might actually hit the algorithm with that
[2022-12-11 15:43:54] <+thee_wall> It makes me laugh every time I see it
[2022-12-11 15:44:04] <KittenMask> gotta respect the hustle

[2022-12-11 15:44:56] <!MemoriesEmbrace> Hippo peepoShy
[2022-12-11 15:44:58] <+thee_wall> As long as you put up a speedrun with ENDING EXPLAINED in the title I'm sure that shit will pop off
[2022-12-11 15:45:16] <%De_cloud> Thats because you didnt call the video i called thor at 3am you wont believe what happens next
[2022-12-11 15:45:22] <%RPD_CHAMBERS> jiyuDisgust
[2022-12-11 15:46:54] <lHereticRamzal> idk why thor from GOW feels so huggable
[2022-12-11 15:47:05] <lastinout> how long have you been doing speedruns?
[2022-12-11 15:47:27] <!MemoriesEmbrace> Guys modCheck
[2022-12-11 15:47:58] <KittenMask> because you're too fast
[2022-12-11 15:48:00] <KittenMask> peepoRun
[2022-12-11 15:48:21] <+thee_wall> Some of the faces on the masks do remind me of the old MOMO stuff
[2022-12-11 15:48:35] <+thee_wall> I suppose that's intentional, since it feels like Two Start wanted this game to go viral
