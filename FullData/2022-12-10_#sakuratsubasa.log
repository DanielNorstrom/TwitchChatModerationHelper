[2022-12-10 05:17:03] <%zebrin_star> Tech will break. Sometimes the manner in which it breaks is useful. Most of the time... It is not.
[2022-12-10 05:17:05] <Ezzlin> I would keep your hopes way down, in fact. Look at what they did for Halloween this year, aka not much.
[2022-12-10 05:17:11] <Ezzlin> Which is fine!
[2022-12-10 05:17:11] <@%DiscoTech90> sakuHiYo lost, zebrin

[2022-12-10 06:40:33] <@%+KanmuriDaYo> There's a dairy about a block from my house that has the best ice cream with generous portions. Like a single scoop is more than what a double would be a like Baskin Robbins.
[2022-12-10 06:40:45] <@%DiscoTech90> omg that's amazing kanmuri

[2022-12-10 06:41:19] <@%DiscoTech90> i live near dairy farms, but i doubt that's the same kinda "dairy" that you're talking about
[2022-12-10 06:41:50] <%+Blandation> sure thing.  and yeah local farm ice cream is the best ice cream you'll get
[2022-12-10 06:41:52] <@%DiscoTech90> but for a moment, i envisioned someone driving off to a dairy farm for some ice cream
[2022-12-10 06:42:25] <@%+KanmuriDaYo> No, you're right. It's an actual dairy farm at the edge of town.
[2022-12-10 06:42:33] <@%+KanmuriDaYo> They just have a storefront there as well.

[2022-12-10 07:59:42] <+GroovyMistress> are you using a tracker
[2022-12-10 07:59:49] <%ROT8> "[...] amazing. *bonk* *bonk*"
[2022-12-10 07:59:54] <!%SereneSnake> The quality of this camera compared to the last one is so good, it's almost jarring.

[2022-12-10 08:01:20] <%+FF3LockeZ> I always think that Saku's tracker is just a decorative border
[2022-12-10 08:01:55] <%Jack_Carsons_Rail_Videos> good lighting is good but for the most part ya also need a good camera to bring out the best of it
[2022-12-10 08:02:18] <@%Smashface_Games> looks alot better than having a big ugly tracker box in a corner of the screen sakuLUL
[2022-12-10 08:02:27] <+GroovyMistress> what setting for this seed

[2022-12-10 08:57:34] <@%+Skarthe> For bonus points, I have an extra D2 that gets in my head, because "D2" was the common abbreviation for a spell in Final Fantasy XI.

[2022-12-10 08:57:51] <!%$cybertyche> The really good ones are OMGRPGs
[2022-12-10 08:58:05] <@%+Skarthe> (it was the abbreviation for Warp II, because Warp in Japanese is "Dezone" and FFXI servers aren't language-specific, so all languages use "D2" for that spell)
[2022-12-10 08:58:37] <%$Aluvae> I was about to ask if FFXI D2 was Warp
[2022-12-10 08:59:25] <@%+Skarthe> Warp was the FFXI equivalent of FFXIV's Return, but it was specific to Black Mages instead of a base functionality.  Warp II was a version that they could cast on party members, so it was common for people to pay for a Black Mage to cast it to send them home.

[2022-12-10 09:02:50] <LegendOfZenith> I almost 100%ed the game. Cane of Somaria was on Master Sword. Everything was all locked in Turtle Rock or in pitch black places. Ice Palace enemy placement made the dungeon a nightmare

[2022-12-10 09:04:22] <@%+madelsberger> you can item-dash with a lot of things.  it's not always intuitive what will happen
[2022-12-10 09:04:34] <@%+madelsberger> like hoot-dash puts you in a superspeed state... because of course it does
[2022-12-10 09:04:40] <@%+madelsberger> *hook

[2022-12-10 09:07:53] <@%+madelsberger> you can drop back out of eg, or if you wander into the aga fight you can get into a weird loop
[2022-12-10 09:09:06] <%+Hyperstryke> The game becomes unplayable.
[2022-12-10 09:09:23] <PizzaHi5> oh i thought hardlock meant you have corrupted your game. Time to reload the geam
[2022-12-10 09:09:30] <@%+madelsberger> traditionally hardlock meant that the computer was completely frozen up, to the point that it might be continually playing a single note of audio.  Softlock pretty much always means "unable to progress".  But unfortunately the specific meanings have become dependent on what game community you're talking to

[2022-12-10 09:35:07] <@%TheInfamousBug> [nerd]Pokemon technically had one of the first randomizers, but the first with true logic checks was Super Metroid[/nerd]

[2022-12-10 09:36:43] <%+murixbob> don't most of the pokemon randos let you adjust the exp rate though?
[2022-12-10 09:36:45] <!TropicalFreeze21> is that THE INFAMOUS BUG?

[2022-12-10 09:38:53] <%+murixbob> there's also Ironmon type randos so you get much more exp from the level boost that trainers end up with
[2022-12-10 09:38:56] <!TropicalFreeze21> is the butter sword margarinely better than the normal sword ? bardA
