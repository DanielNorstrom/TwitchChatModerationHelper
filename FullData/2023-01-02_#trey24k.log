[2023-01-02 01:09:37] <$mrmclolz> shoot the weapon without a round basically
[2023-01-02 01:09:46] <%monkimonki_> @turr16xd the thing is he was inciting he was shooting himself, pretty dumb
[2023-01-02 01:09:55] <%+CapHawk_> is that bad to do?

[2023-01-02 01:10:10] <+ImBlueDuck> didnt that guy on tiger king think he was gonna do that and it wen twrong
[2023-01-02 01:10:13] <%Slayforpay> it can be useful to train with dry fires and a casing or a nickel balanced on your frontsight. just don't put it to your head.
[2023-01-02 01:10:22] <Kepelii> @CapHawk_ was not pointed at a safe location
[2023-01-02 01:10:24] <thats_brazy_> Lots of people have done it
[2023-01-02 01:10:24] <+T0kyoXL> @swedxn shot the gun without it being loaded
[2023-01-02 01:10:27] <%itz_soccer> @762x39killedmydolphin Last question. If you want to customs for all of those where did you get your food for the acquaintance?
[2023-01-02 01:10:29] <!%calebtothemax_> @b3njamino we got Kob a sledgehammer and portable FIRST ATTEMPT
[2023-01-02 01:10:31] <%monkimonki_> @CapHawk_ dryfire can ware on your firing pin and increase failure to fire
[2023-01-02 01:10:32] <thats_brazy_> And hurt themselves
[2023-01-02 01:10:37] <!pittiky> monkaSHAKE
[2023-01-02 01:10:38] <%Brad14w> holy
[2023-01-02 01:10:39] <X_Raid> You should always treat a gun like it's loaded even if you know it's not - so definitely don't point it at yourself and pull the trigger

[2023-01-02 01:10:58] <%Slayforpay> a good rule of thumb is never point a firearm at something you dont absolutely want to destroy
[2023-01-02 01:10:59] <jakeOHHGEE> @CapHawk_ not for most guns
[2023-01-02 01:10:59] <%+MrStrothmann> maybe would have gone for the green stim there

[2023-01-02 01:11:03] <%+shobbzane> You never aim it at a human. EVER unloaded or loaded
[2023-01-02 01:11:06] <island_boy_420> it had to be airsoft right?
[2023-01-02 01:11:07] <%Slayforpay> even if you are positive its unloaded

[2023-01-02 01:11:16] <Kepelii> but you need to handle any firearm if its was live no matter what

[2023-01-02 01:43:24] <+endowedturtle> @PooSmusher  I agree that drugs are a much lesser problem (excluding opiates, that shit needs to be addressed) but people who want to be violent and cause harm are gonna kill eachother with knives or hammers just as much guns. Any amount of firearm legislation harms those who follow the rules
[2023-01-02 01:43:30] <+TheCrazedBanana> Check grenade kills. You RG him.

[2023-01-02 01:44:56] <%PooSmusher> @endowedturtle oh dont get me wrong I dont want more gun laws. I want less gun laws fuck the ATF I just think we as a country should arm more citizens to reduce the rise of gun violence. if you notice they go for sooft targets

[2023-01-02 01:46:06] <%cleeterrr> coming out juiced was the most fun
[2023-01-02 01:46:06] <+natty_slight> true irl too
[2023-01-02 01:46:08] <fvbben> @endowedturtle great deer and fox shotguns aswell tho.. 12 gauge atleast
[2023-01-02 01:46:08] <TOWBAtv> not true for me :/
[2023-01-02 01:46:09] <xxprobigfloppaxx> zero motherfucker
[2023-01-02 01:46:25] <%+Hyp0beric> I thought they were going to bring in the second PMC this wipe that doesn't wipe every season, what happened with that?
[2023-01-02 01:46:25] <Esperek> @xxprobigfloppaxx zero for 1 Miles Kappa
[2023-01-02 01:46:26] <%^b3njamino> which is why i 'accidentally' kill my homies and take their gear
[2023-01-02 01:46:26] <0hhNaTo> !zero
[2023-01-02 01:46:27] <+mx33> true. i ended last wipe with 50mil from scav runs and i was so bored. this wipe just losing all my money not scavving is way more fun
[2023-01-02 01:46:29] <zeus_658> Why dont you zero the distance?
[2023-01-02 01:46:30] <%^b3njamino> so they have more fun
[2023-01-02 01:46:38] <%funkyphysics> going in with some rat kit and then coming out full juiced is the funnest thing
[2023-01-02 01:46:39] <leijo2002> whats kappa?
[2023-01-02 01:46:40] <TOWBAtv> pvp is whats most pvp, especiallly high gear lvl pvp
[2023-01-02 01:46:43] <+jerryg_ttv> trey thats called type 2 fun
[2023-01-02 01:46:48] <+endowedturtle> @edoggee  Think about it. An armed society is a polite one. You don't run up and mug people if you think they're packing. Guns are just tools, they can be misused the same as any other tool
[2023-01-02 01:46:50] <hypercrazy33069> honestly that is true because when they did the last wipe where everything was 1 rouble, it was kind of boring having everything in the game.
[2023-01-02 01:46:51] <TOWBAtv> fun*
[2023-01-02 01:46:52] <%F1ckel> more fun when you have notihng to lose

[2023-01-02 02:35:17] <+TargonRS> no clue what goon squad is
[2023-01-02 02:35:20] <%+allemsu> makes it that much better when you run into the mtho
[2023-01-02 02:35:20] <inferiorrrrr> i just killed a level 42 on Streets, i lowkey thought u were only lvl 42 @Trey24k
[2023-01-02 02:35:23] <+JNips15> I played 10 raids and ran into the goon squad at level 5
[2023-01-02 02:35:26] <$jocecs> 2 wipes ago cultists were everywhere
[2023-01-02 02:35:26] <+Staerk> I cultist farmed though, and then accidentally found goons on woods @ tower... that was awful
[2023-01-02 02:35:26] <%+KamiKatz3> ~350 Hrs, no Cultists, No Goons, didn't see every Boss yet
[2023-01-02 02:35:28] <+l0fer> I saw Sanitar once, before the event.
[2023-01-02 02:35:28] <%+coyoteecal> i got killed by the goons my first raid on customs this wipe 😂
[2023-01-02 02:35:30] <%SteremyJeele> But also, the average player isn't fighting cultists/goon squad anyway, they're just dying to them.
[2023-01-02 02:35:33] <%Bxnnp> @Trey24k ive seen goons twice this wipe and it was back to back me and my friends couldnt believe it
[2023-01-02 02:35:33] <@%LogicalSolutions> Cutlists are 2% rn I think

[2023-01-02 02:36:23] <+Staerk> I spent 190 hours last wipe trying to learn how to kill cultists on Woods, that was awful and would never recommend that shit again. Theyre so hard to fight outside of Lumber + up north in sunken village.

[2023-01-02 02:37:13] <irishpixiecorn> Imagine cultist hiding in the bathrooms
[2023-01-02 02:37:13] <edisomxl> not last wipe, but the wipe before I found they spawned so much, didn't really see them too much last wipe.
[2023-01-02 02:37:14] <+Staerk> Cultists spawned at dorms for the H'ween event didnt they?>
[2023-01-02 02:37:14] <%F1ckel> bushes in the back of dorms could be cool
[2023-01-02 02:37:18] <@%^Boos> the cultist event 2 wipes ago for halloween was fun @Trey24k
[2023-01-02 02:37:20] <%lolaustin> Cultist should be able to hide in the rooms and run through them and shiz
[2023-01-02 02:37:20] <Esperek> @99Slayerbtw next to church i think
[2023-01-02 02:37:21] <%Cookies_nCream> it’s so annoying because you forget these ai exist in the game and just get slapped by them
[2023-01-02 02:37:22] <@%^Boos> they were in dorm then

[2023-01-02 04:29:19] <+Remixt_> I can explain a memory leak if you want. Am software engineer.
[2023-01-02 04:29:20] <%+Murcovsky> @hyumenn where did you get that from?
[2023-01-02 04:29:21] <okturtleee> game just keeps using more ram than needed
[2023-01-02 04:29:22] <+BrotherBloat> stutters for my machine were caused by binaural - some configurations are suffering from some bug

[2023-01-02 04:29:26] <+xxxkaydee> the longer you play the more ram game needs basicly
[2023-01-02 04:29:30] <%hyumenn> sacrifices must be made for the gains
[2023-01-02 04:29:40] <+Equinox_Zo> "a memory leak is a type of resource leak that occurs when a computer program incorrectly manages memory allocations in a way that memory which is no longer needed is not released."
[2023-01-02 04:29:41] <%Slayforpay> it does like a ton of processes over and over which opens more processes so it keeps processing the same shit unnecesarily...i think
[2023-01-02 04:29:43] <+hyraxify> are you the highest level right now or are there players higher levek
[2023-01-02 04:29:45] <%+king_coolboi> A memory leak is when code is writing data down and not deleting it. it accumulates somewhere and is like a bag getting heavier and heavier

[2023-01-02 04:30:06] <AmplifiedTV> @F1ckel Memory leak is when things are stored in memory and not cleared. So the memory usage over time keeps increasing.
[2023-01-02 04:30:07] <Esperek> @Slayforpay My ram usage is like 97% when I am on Lighthouse :D
[2023-01-02 04:30:09] <%Slayforpay> the fuckin health on that guy
[2023-01-02 04:30:12] <%+youngbaggg> that boy be eating
[2023-01-02 04:30:26] <+Remixt_> Basically a memory leak happens when you allocate memory for a task, then when that task is complete, not all of the memory is added back to the pool of available memory.
[2023-01-02 04:30:30] <%toohardtoofard> Im on a 2060 and if i play streets my pc literally just turns off
[2023-01-02 04:30:40] <+Remixt_> If you do that task enough, it will fill your memory all the way up.
[2023-01-02 04:30:41] <%Slayforpay> @Esperek lmao same
[2023-01-02 04:30:43] <%$lt_carl_winslow> ram leak basically means when tarkov uses up ram it doesn't give it back once its finished

[2023-01-02 04:31:23] <AmplifiedTV> @F1ckel So the longer you play the worse it'll run. Probably due to the language they use. Some languages add it back to the pool automatically, others don't. They likely use a language that doesn't and haven't manually set it to do so in some of their new processes

[2023-01-02 04:31:59] <%jeadexo> @kisukes_hat yo I was talking to you about the cali sushi roll right?
[2023-01-02 04:32:01] <%Slayforpay> but directionally and distance is so fucked

[2023-01-02 04:32:32] <!%^kisukes_hat> Its just simply registering the sound
[2023-01-02 04:32:33] <+ImBlueDuck> you can tho because you're my strimmer
[2023-01-02 04:32:39] <MapFlow> @Trey24k I had to turn spatial sound back on in windows settings, it helped with directional.

[2023-01-02 04:38:59] <+Remixt_> If you randomly clean memory outside of the game it could cause a crash. Wouldn’t advise.
[2023-01-02 04:39:06] <%$bennie5fingers> @Trey24k Nothing you can do other than restart the game every while.

[2023-01-02 16:20:45] <%$Ubernoobtuber> @orbitazi it’s early wipe, a lot of people focus on quests earlier to build your hideout and level traders, then you can start looking for more pvp

[2023-01-02 17:46:42] <%+CONFIRMEDxKILL> @CONFIRMEDxKILL The officers have weapons and body armor for officer safety. If a state doesn't allow for it's citizens to have window tint it should apply to everyone and there be no special carve outs for commercial and government vehicles.

[2023-01-02 19:18:44] <+jasp3rs> Ergo should effect more IMO
[2023-01-02 19:18:46] <NoRoubles> can i have that gas analyzer
[2023-01-02 19:18:46] <JuioWS> supressor is too strong
[2023-01-02 19:18:46] <+vrightnuttt> they should lower horizontal recoil whole muzzle brake lowers vertical, thats the realism to it.

[2023-01-02 19:19:04] <cryocsgo> BMD gets beat by QDC and suppressor
[2023-01-02 19:19:04] <StonedSights> they should go for gassing mod, suppressed weapons cycle faster than unsuppressed

[2023-01-02 19:24:07] <%+justinsert420> I'd go shark fin irl all the way
[2023-01-02 19:24:09] <%$fullerk55> @ChongRips Yeah it is lame
[2023-01-02 19:24:12] <%SteremyJeele> I tried a 45 degree grip on one of my guns and it was super uncomfortable. Made the gun feel twice as heavy.
[2023-01-02 19:24:12] <$Monkinator37> @humID_chad what shit, there's nothing there
[2023-01-02 19:24:13] <+Demaestro_TTV> People use shark-fins so they can C-Clamp their rifles.
[2023-01-02 19:24:18] <+thegreatme22> i feel like the gangsta grip would be the worst for recoil in real life
[2023-01-02 19:24:18] <+Perish_TV> i like my bcm gunfighter nice
[2023-01-02 19:24:20] <%YogurtEnema> pistol grips look mad cool when you cock back a shotty

[2023-01-02 19:24:27] <%F1ckel> i think IRL most guys use SE-5 type grips or a over barrel grip
[2023-01-02 19:24:28] <%Slayforpay> yeah irl just like a 2 in stopper is perfect
[2023-01-02 19:24:29] <Ferfin> That's what I use, the mlock hand stop, small, effective, doesn't get in the way of a full c grip

[2023-01-02 19:55:41] <%Scuba_SK> what if they gave you a special slot just for keys. That way you could loot task keys and not lose them
[2023-01-02 19:55:42] <+RookieWinter1> what about for kits
[2023-01-02 19:55:42] <rvbfill> Container should be locked after join the raid. You can take stuff out but cant put in.

[2023-01-02 19:59:41] <a7_n1ghtmar3> WHats with the long wait times in between matches?

[2023-01-02 19:59:44] <snd_guy> Just stop giving the keys value by giving more spawn frequency so the value drops
[2023-01-02 19:59:45] <+k1ng__duck> so far my keys luck has been great. i got dorm marked key and cottage key in a single day

[2023-01-02 19:59:48] <xdabanx> but its only annoying the first few months of wipe and for ppl like you who do speedruns
[2023-01-02 19:59:50] <epicbarrie1> just killed a guy who had fir taiga-1 probs found it at old gas if i pushed him i couldve gotten it maybe ;c
[2023-01-02 19:59:51] <tilo_schwarzbach> the most people that play like only 2 hours a day, play in big groups, so if anyone find a key they all can use it

[2023-01-02 20:00:22] <%+shobbzane> True. You have to play this game like 6 hours a day per wipe in order to enjoy it.
[2023-01-02 20:00:22] <%$TvNefarious> it can be hard and still possible for casuals to succeed
[2023-01-02 20:00:22] <+PinchWinters> thats what arena will be for
