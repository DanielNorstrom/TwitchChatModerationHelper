[2023-01-04 16:40:42] <lamoo7> @TBou_nyncuk i have 1 mil on garen so nope
[2023-01-04 16:40:44] <lunatiikk_> thats why zeri dont get buffes
[2023-01-04 16:40:46] <940907> who buy skin if you can drop it
[2023-01-04 16:40:48] VIEWERS: 2¬†548
[2023-01-04 16:40:52] <artfulchaos9> rip :/
[2023-01-04 16:40:52] <wildriftboi1> Id rather join in a difficult season like when aphelios released in s10
[2023-01-04 16:40:54] <lunatiikk_> because she has not a llot of skins
[2023-01-04 16:40:54] <+olafciioo> when does new season start??
[2023-01-04 16:40:54] <%MeGudMyTeamXD> and they nerf zeri KEKW
[2023-01-04 16:40:59] <200ckobra> they should make easy champs with low skill cap that get u to plat not fkn challenger walk and kill all
[2023-01-04 16:41:02] <940907> make new acc and pretend you play toplane champs only
[2023-01-04 16:41:07] <+Hartassen> @olafciioo 10th
[2023-01-04 16:41:07] <lurinay> But should still be fair
[2023-01-04 16:41:14] <940907> you will drop  adc skins till lvl 20
[2023-01-04 16:41:15] <ALHmercs> sylas is juicing up from ur wave then
[2023-01-04 16:41:23] <%lerf0> @lerf0 master+ jgl is dominated by sylas/graves/kindred/heca. Rammus is only good because a lot of low elo players draft full ad teams. You can reach chall with any champ that doesn't mean its strong or broken
[2023-01-04 16:41:25] <wonder_vat_land> Lord Doms next, right?
