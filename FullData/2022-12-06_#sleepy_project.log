[2022-12-06 23:36:22] <VictusThraex> I understand sleepy PA the state i lived in for some time has the same bullshit going on
[2022-12-06 23:36:23] <%+speznasv> but at the same time it isn´t worth the time doing that for a gun
[2022-12-06 23:36:28] <tacticaloni1> the 12 gauge deagle hmmmm
[2022-12-06 23:36:31] <%+Mijolnir__> the majority of cops are like that
[2022-12-06 23:36:31] <Jraie> it's becoming a more and more common reality
[2022-12-06 23:36:32] <@%jilly_mod> rappolt has no idea what hes tslking about i bet he moves cones Feloniously
[2022-12-06 23:36:33] <%Rappolt> "He said he didn't wanna be arrested, that's resisting arrest" (actually a thing in some counties, usually called "Passive Resistance"
[2022-12-06 23:36:36] <+admiral_bllau> yeah theres zero recourse unless you can spend a shit load of money
[2022-12-06 23:36:37] <Jraie> which is frankly disturbing.
[2022-12-06 23:36:42] <+admiral_bllau> which most people can't especially now

[2022-12-06 23:37:43] <chuito12> Passive Resistance charge exists for good reason, its when a person goes limp and forces the cops to carry them for an arrest. Its just the cunts abusing it
[2022-12-06 23:37:44] <tacticaloni1> oh the atf they think a bianary triggers make the guns full auto

[2022-12-06 23:37:56] <%+Ingress_> That ATF agent getting arrested was GOLD
[2022-12-06 23:37:57] <CupcakeWarrior> i dont ever want a gun tbh

[2022-12-06 23:38:03] <CupcakeWarrior> but i need to get oen
[2022-12-06 23:38:17] <%Rappolt> When you don't comply with a wrongful arrest, you're now being charged with not complying, which makes it infinitely harder to get defense and much more expensive. Oftentimes, that non-compliance is still criminal
[2022-12-06 23:38:22] <shiijei_kun> AuditTheAudit's a fun channel to see police behaviour

[2022-12-06 23:39:11] <+Ausl0ser> @Blue_Cornflower he got roughed up
[2022-12-06 23:39:13] <%+heftychonkster> ATF had it coming, he was out there harassing locals for solvent traps allegedly
[2022-12-06 23:39:13] <+SecretAgentPickles> Got his ego checked
[2022-12-06 23:39:21] <%$noirnit_ttv> taze him?
[2022-12-06 23:39:26] <%$noirnit_ttv> more like shot him in the chest
[2022-12-06 23:39:29] <+Ausl0ser> she was just happy to see a fed getting smacked aorund

[2022-12-06 23:40:04] <%chutche> 1 taze per dog the ATF agent has shot
[2022-12-06 23:40:05] <@%ParanoidCorgi> also don't sweat it, its your project gun and zatsu
[2022-12-06 23:40:27] <%$noirnit_ttv> @Jraie ik it was a joke the cop that accidently shot the person instead of tazing
[2022-12-06 23:40:29] <%Rappolt> THat's what Zatsu is, though
[2022-12-06 23:40:30] <+SecretAgentPickles> This upsets the Pippa
[2022-12-06 23:40:35] <%+speznasv> the flyer handling gameplay looks good
[2022-12-06 23:40:39] <Jraie> I mean it was blatant over reach on the police's side, But at the same time the ATF agent was in a legal grey area in the first place.
[2022-12-06 23:40:42] <+admiral_bllau> the ATF agent in that video was also a serial thief tenmaStare
[2022-12-06 23:40:47] <%$noirnit_ttv> take em on in court
[2022-12-06 23:40:49] <Circa_Sisyphus> u cant talk ur way out of getting arrested
[2022-12-06 23:40:50] <chuito12> Watch donut operator guys. He's great at covering police stuff, when the cops are in the right and calls them out when they're being idiots
[2022-12-06 23:40:57] <@%jilly_mod> shoot the cop
[2022-12-06 23:41:00] <%rushtee_snacklefjord> qualified immunity as well

[2022-12-06 23:41:29] <Jraie> I'm pretty sure she got cleared of charges didn't she?
[2022-12-06 23:41:32] <%+speznasv> it´s a waste of time for you, they are being payed to appear in court
[2022-12-06 23:41:34] <tum_tum474> sleepyproFear  you still lose money and time
[2022-12-06 23:41:36] <%$noirnit_ttv> @Jraie yea lol
[2022-12-06 23:41:36] <%+speznasv> so it´s not worth it
[2022-12-06 23:41:38] <WhiteRen> the cops use your tax money to fight you in court
[2022-12-06 23:41:42] <+SecretAgentPickles> "Don't try to debate law on the street, save it for the courtroom."
[2022-12-06 23:41:42] <AnarcKyo> That’s so dumb wtf
[2022-12-06 23:41:45] <tacticaloni1> oh btw one of the best 2011s is probably  infinity works they are so god dam expensive
[2022-12-06 23:41:46] <+Ausl0ser> for us mere mortals we can't afford lawyer fees for things like that
[2022-12-06 23:41:55] <%+heftychonkster> Should be able to sue them for cost PLUS in order to keep them accountable
[2022-12-06 23:42:18] <+Ausl0ser> and that's why i carry a boring glock instead of a nice gun
[2022-12-06 23:42:23] <%Rappolt> As long as you're being reasonable, you won't get arrested... by a reasonable cop. You still will if the cop is unreasonable
[2022-12-06 23:42:25] <%+ewfisher> That's why when you sue you sue for court costs and punitive damages.
[2022-12-06 23:42:35] <@%jilly_mod> No victim no crime

[2022-12-06 23:44:47] <Jraie> it's not just a corrupt individual but sometimes it's a broken system.
[2022-12-06 23:44:54] <%+speznasv> they are civil servants
[2022-12-06 23:44:57] <%$noirnit_ttv> apparently ive been told to always get 2 guns licenses because if ur gun is involved with a crime and they seize your gun or guns license u can still have your other guns and prove you can own them

[2022-12-06 23:45:13] <$WanderingDisciple> the problem with any government worker is that they inherently represent the government they work for yet are still individuals
[2022-12-06 23:45:21] <LoyalCavalier> Some cases with police corruption there are those high in power that even fighting it is hard for the non corrupted police officers.
[2022-12-06 23:45:27] <Jraie> Yeah, shit changes so much based on the local level, And the US is a big place.

[2022-12-06 23:53:21] <%SimpIyLogan> HOLY SHIT..... never expected the LEDx to be so big when i was looking at it on the store page.... or you have really tiny hands...
[2022-12-06 23:53:28] <%$noirnit_ttv> @noirnit_ttv like if u think about it lets say every female gives birth to 2 off springs and every asexual parthenogenesis females gives birth to 2 there is more of an impact on the population if 2 asexual reproducing females are born compared to sexual reproduction in case a male is born with the offspring
[2022-12-06 23:53:39] <%+speznasv> you wanted to grab something to drink
[2022-12-06 23:54:02] <%$JrD94> right i go sleep goodnight
[2022-12-06 23:54:04] <%$noirnit_ttv> so its just better overall to have an asexual female in the species
[2022-12-06 23:54:15] <%$noirnit_ttv> compared to male and female
[2022-12-06 23:54:16] <%KuroKamuy> I have a similar mindset
