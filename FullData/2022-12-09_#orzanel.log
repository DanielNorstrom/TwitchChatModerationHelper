[2022-12-09 09:41:41] <@^Nightbot> If you are new to WoT, use these tips: 1. Dont rush tiers. 2. Dont use mods, especially XVM. 3. Stick to Russian heavies for a start to learn game better, sidescraping, angling etc. 4. Dont buy high tier premium tanks, until you play regular tanks in that tier. 5. Watch this stream to become better player, watch my positioning on the maps and listen to what i say because i explain what i'm doing B) . Watch Wargaming videos about game mechanics

[2022-12-09 09:49:04] <@^Nightbot> If you are new to WoT, use these tips: 1. Dont rush tiers. 2. Dont use mods, especially XVM. 3. Stick to Russian heavies for a start to learn game better, sidescraping, angling etc. 4. Dont buy high tier premium tanks, until you play regular tanks in that tier. 5. Watch this stream to become better player, watch my positioning on the maps and listen to what i say because i explain what i'm doing B) . Watch Wargaming videos about game mechanics

[2022-12-09 09:49:55] <@^Nightbot> Ok-ish tank, pretty much a super pershing with better gun and slightly better armor but no preff mm. Decent speed and gun handling, good penetration, bad dpm. Overall an ok-ish tank.

[2022-12-09 10:52:02] <@^Nightbot> Ok-ish tank, pretty much a super pershing with better gun and slightly better armor but no preff mm. Decent speed and gun handling, good penetration, bad dpm. Overall an ok-ish tank.
[2022-12-09 10:52:12] <%wims80> hm okay

[2022-12-09 12:40:55] <@%stevie__ray_vaughan> !ambt
[2022-12-09 12:40:55] <@^Nightbot> Orza got the tank for 30K. Decent tank, very nice acceleration but no high top speed, nice turret armor, ok-ish gun handling, dispersion not very good on the move, decent pen with standard and gold, nice dmg potential, decent gun depression, mediocre moneymaker, average viewrange. Play it like a heavy using the turret, not so much flanking around and the lack of speed will not be a problem. Overall decent tank.
