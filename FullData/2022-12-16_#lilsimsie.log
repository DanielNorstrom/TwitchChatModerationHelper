Please don't make a big deal about it or guilt her in chat. It's really upsetting to have people complaining all day when we're just trying to have fun. She has TONS of Sims content on YouTube, and we'll play The Sims again later this week.

[2022-12-16 22:23:53] <@%^Moobot> simsieNo NO, DO THIS! CHANGE THIS! EWWWW! Backseat gaming is NEVER allowed. Suggestions are always appreciated, but do not attempt to make demands or force Kayla to do anything. There is a difference between friendly suggestions and aggressive demands. Ultimately she is the one playing the game, not you! simsieNo

[2022-12-16 22:26:20] <%+erincatherine7> yes she did babybel cheese
[2022-12-16 22:26:22] <harleynori> I'm not a swimsuit kinda girl lol
[2022-12-16 22:26:23] <%Jeais> Strapless is a bit risky if you want to actually swim
[2022-12-16 22:26:24] <%+coeurdechoeur> Strapless bathing suits always make me nervous for the poor sim's chest, even though I know it doesn't matter in game
[2022-12-16 22:26:24] <%$baileycakes215> I do not understand strapless üòÇüòÇ
[2022-12-16 22:26:25] <%$lollyybee> it would be public indecency for me to wear anything  strapless
[2022-12-16 22:26:25] <Ari_0401> yellow is only valid in the nb flag and nowhere else
[2022-12-16 22:26:26] <%+pamvl2001> strapless scares me
[2022-12-16 22:26:27] <callmereeses> tattoo?
[2022-12-16 22:26:27] <+SulkyShine> i always get insecure about my wide shoulders LOL

[2022-12-16 22:26:28] <%bunnyofnightvale> @maricathefrog Yep! Lion and blue babybel cheese
[2022-12-16 22:26:29] <+bybarbella> thats artsy
[2022-12-16 22:26:29] <+isabella_sherry> you mean purple lol
[2022-12-16 22:26:29] <%+herewegoajenn> The plum gen of NSB was painful for me to decorate with lol, that being said for some reason I don't mind wearing purple as much but decorating with it is just not my thing
[2022-12-16 22:26:30] <%c_leanna> That too is amazing!!
[2022-12-16 22:26:32] <%+13Flags> @maricathefrog Yes! We had a lion plushy and a blue babybel!

[2022-12-16 22:26:38] <%modernwednesday> I thought she liked yellow but hated purple?
[2022-12-16 22:26:39] <%+MaeMay101> @qu33nofkhaos if all the rocks are in the middle! eat only 1 fruit, break the very top rock and pole vault over then hit the rocks and all should be money
[2022-12-16 22:26:40] <%moonyschocolate> doesn't she hate purple?
[2022-12-16 22:26:42] <%$mistikfic> That shirt is so cute

[2022-12-16 22:26:45] <%afrench1520> what if she was both a painter and a photographer and sold her paintings and photos
[2022-12-16 22:26:45] <%$baileycakes215> Strapless is possible for like 3% of people lol.
[2022-12-16 22:26:46] <%+cate_12345> Strapless seems rly stressful especially when swimming
[2022-12-16 22:26:46] <%+fluffy0003> tattoo?
[2022-12-16 22:26:47] <MoniqueMoon260> Ellie is pretty tbh

[2022-12-16 22:26:49] <maddhatter9> She reminds me of my aunt lol
[2022-12-16 22:26:50] <+isabella_sherry> love the shirt
[2022-12-16 22:26:50] <$rabidcherry> living recklessly through them and their questionable top structures is it for me

[2022-12-16 22:26:57] <%+EmazingEmma> I mean orange is the exact opposite of purple so that kinda makes sense!
[2022-12-16 22:26:58] <%$alaurel17> have we decided what kind of retail store?

[2022-12-16 22:58:10] <@%^Moobot> simsieNo NO, DO THIS! CHANGE THIS! EWWWW! Backseat gaming is NEVER allowed. Suggestions are always appreciated, but do not attempt to make demands or force Kayla to do anything. There is a difference between friendly suggestions and aggressive demands. Ultimately she is the one playing the game, not you! simsieNo

[2022-12-16 23:07:15] <%+lemons_limes0> When you change the lifespan does it change other saves too?
[2022-12-16 23:07:16] <%The_Wickerest> It would be pets all over again

[2022-12-16 23:07:23] <@%brewwin> im really excited but im playing a challenge where im playing with custom lifespans :))))))))))))))))))) going to mess up everything
[2022-12-16 23:07:27] <%$River_Styx19> @themostprecioussweetbean yeah and they haven't added anything for pets since

[2022-12-16 23:07:34] <%afrench1520> and that would mean no toddler assets either, like new beds

[2022-12-16 23:08:21] <%+maiziemaze23> Do you think the new life state will be able to be created in CAS?
[2022-12-16 23:08:23] <%+mollslovescats_> my concern w the infants is that the life state will be skewed - if you spend so long being a baby/infant/toddler then just as much time as a kid/teen/young adult? just feels disporportionate
[2022-12-16 23:08:23] <%aoiT0RI> i personally wouldnt mind an infant kit/stuff pack for extra changing tables or strollers or whatever
[2022-12-16 23:08:25] <@%+MrsTomato101814> @afrench1520 on console it is, but not for pc/mac
[2022-12-16 23:08:28] <wonderfullbabyy> hello
[2022-12-16 23:08:29] <%$jasperryan6> do you think in sims 5 they will make pets come with it? so they can keep adding things?

[2022-12-16 23:09:25] <@%brewwin> i hope they just give us generations ;)

[2022-12-16 23:09:30] <%afrench1520> if toddlers were dlc we wouldnt have gotten toddler stuff, then again we might not need that pack in that instance

[2022-12-16 23:10:01] <savthesoupbucket> they added the pack refresh in spa day why didnt they do that in cats and dogs
[2022-12-16 23:10:04] <%+moonpearl33> @wonderfullbabyy Nopppp
[2022-12-16 23:10:08] <%Missygirl93> They could make a generations pack for more baby stuff
[2022-12-16 23:10:10] <ryanmcknght> There‚Äôs pet clothes in nifty knitting? I knew about the ones in Cottage Living but not that
[2022-12-16 23:10:17] <%alicehasnolife> 500k eggs finally simsieAHH
[2022-12-16 23:10:24] <%$kskeine> yeah it's not the whole focus of the new pack, so it's like a bonus if you have it and if you dont, you dont miss out

[2022-12-16 23:10:30] <%$jasperryan6> so do you think sims 5 will have pets come with it for free so they dont have a repeat of my first pet stuff?
[2022-12-16 23:10:32] <%+Berean01> Hmmm, I should play sims again. I need a relaxing game.
[2022-12-16 23:10:33] <%42hitch42> it's normal dlc instead of dlc for dlc
[2022-12-16 23:10:34] <%salty_machela> I think if my first pets came out like a year later people would have liked it better

[2022-12-16 23:10:43] <%+jennylynnsims> we don't have money for a lottery ticket lol
[2022-12-16 23:10:45] <%+moonpearl33> @wonderfullbabyy You welcome bestie
[2022-12-16 23:10:55] <%+lemons_limes0> @ryanmcknght I believe you can knit the clothing in cottage living for your ‚Äúpets‚Äù (chickens, cows, etc)
[2022-12-16 23:10:56] <@%brewwin> there is something about the packs not being completely seperate from each other that makes the game more seemless- but when you have a dlc MADE for another dlc thats different
[2022-12-16 23:10:57] <%afrench1520> cross pack compatibility makes the game feel more unified rather than each pack feeling like a different game at times
[2022-12-16 23:10:59] <carolmanbat> imo it takes so long for them to decide to buy
[2022-12-16 23:11:04] <laotoett> how about buying some perks using perk points

[2022-12-16 23:11:15] <%+mona1987> @lilsimsie you should use your retail perk points.

[2022-12-16 23:11:18] <kimorasimz> are you using a retail mod for a live-in business?

[2022-12-16 23:20:18] <%Missygirl93> New flooring was put in last year

[2022-12-16 23:20:32] <GoldenWing6> @13flags the part at the bottom of your walls
[2022-12-16 23:20:33] <%afrench1520> the only time i ever look at the baseboards is when i paint them
[2022-12-16 23:20:36] <%+snowy_flake> just don‚Äôt look down and the guests are good
[2022-12-16 23:20:39] <+haleylooya> I just use a broom to dust the baseboards before I vacuum. If it's been a while it does get sort of stuck on though and requires a little more elbow grease
[2022-12-16 23:20:41] <quest_ce_what> Put a vacuum hose under the drill next time - no need to wipe the dust :P
[2022-12-16 23:20:45] <%+13Flags> @GoldenWing6 Ooooooooooooh, thanks!
[2022-12-16 23:20:46] <%+moonpearl33> you strike me as a very clean and tidy person I‚Äôm a right ?
