I just thought maybe itâd be fun to roleplay with you as your online gf maybe? I know youâre straight. Iâm a boy thatâs why I was saying roleplay.. this isnât a troll. again, I know itâs really random and weird. Iâm sorry.

[2023-01-03 06:42:52] <%SteremyJeele> @richard_cranium777 I think I gave you directions to part 2 earlier by mistake. There's a building with a really nice palace-looking interior near sewers. There's a table with like 9 bodybags and a camera.
[2023-01-03 06:43:00] <datcolorman32> thats some bullshit if i even look at a scav i get one tapped

[2023-01-03 06:43:33] <metrize> @colechiils yeah it's just venting at the end of the day but if there are enough people voicing their opinions they will have to change at some point
[2023-01-03 06:43:33] <%alexcarp33> i wish they would add more AK variants and 9x18 ammo TBH

[2023-01-03 06:44:32] <quacksacktey> @drakzmeister yea
[2023-01-03 06:44:32] <+Vanillasoup_> @alexcarp33 personally i think there could be a few more 12 gauge shells, as well as a few more random bullets that have 0 purpose
[2023-01-03 06:44:34] <+tonelul> farming strength too at the same time
[2023-01-03 06:44:35] <%ColeChiIls> @metrize Have you spent the last 6 to 7 years coding an overly complicated game in Unity? LUL I get about venting I do. But what do you want? More content faster? I dont think its as simple as reee lead the devs better. Every game out has issues with content keeping up with the players. As far as I know though
[2023-01-03 06:44:44] <quacksacktey> why u keep them for last lol
[2023-01-03 06:44:45] <+GlenJam0> just go to woods tagged and cursed
[2023-01-03 06:44:45] <shananiginsoriginal> On woods the town next to the car extract you can melee scavs
[2023-01-03 06:44:46] <!%calebtothemax_> "if this tweet gets 6 likes i'll drop my onlyfans"
[2023-01-03 06:44:48] <%JakegotCakeO> power station

[2023-01-03 06:44:53] <+codenamepa> shoreline is going to be the worst
[2023-01-03 06:44:53] <%ColeChiIls> Did you try the naked marked and cursed
[2023-01-03 06:44:56] <waitimdesyncd> resort on shoreline and village on woods its easy
[2023-01-03 06:44:56] <%Roloisanewb> a lil resort action?
[2023-01-03 06:44:57] <+Uncle_Cheddar> prob scav bunker area?
[2023-01-03 06:44:57] <%CranioDraven> @metrize there are players in the game that dont even stream that are nearly kappa promise
[2023-01-03 06:44:58] <%+ghost51fteen> shoot the scavs make them run inside of fob and scav house
[2023-01-03 06:45:00] <+ttstylez> whats the reward for this quest @Trey24k
[2023-01-03 06:45:01] <%General_HAM> Surely 2thy finishes those maps tonight :)
[2023-01-03 06:45:02] <+Vanillasoup_> @Trey24k rush power plant on shoreline prolly, on woods the northern village?

[2023-01-03 06:45:18] <waitimdesyncd> village on woods has 10 scavs u can melee in the houses alone
[2023-01-03 06:45:18] <metrize> @colechiils yeah you're right, but it's a consistent failure on their part so it's just annoying. what can you do though
[2023-01-03 06:45:19] <Faraksiss> How's it going trey
[2023-01-03 06:45:24] <!%calebtothemax_> you gotta do it

[2023-01-03 06:45:52] <+Vanillasoup_> ill gift 10 if you can manage to melee shturman lmfao
[2023-01-03 06:45:59] <quacksacktey> honestly if you just suicide rush the scavs with a 9mil and a melee its quick
[2023-01-03 06:46:02] <metrize> @craniodraven yeah I can imagine tbh even in China and places that don't stream on twitch necessarily
[2023-01-03 06:46:11] <Sc0tty2Hotty91> So does the new transmitter work on the new mines they added above Building three as well in deactivating. Or just lighthouse? @trey24k
[2023-01-03 06:46:12] <+Boz____> kappa still 55?

[2023-01-03 06:46:39] <%ColeChiIls> @metrize Nothing at all really. Ive been seeing the same complaints since alpha man. People literally crying about artist not fixing netcode, and coders not designing maps. People crying cuz game is too arcadey or too hard, crying that theres too much x content and not enough y. Its kinda funny at this point LUL

[2023-01-03 18:15:46] <%SteremyJeele> I think vitals just means like blood pressure, oxygen and heart rate. But his vitals would not be good if he wasn't intubated.

[2023-01-03 18:16:57] <bhatch145> its a really rare condition that only happens when you get hit at a very precise time in the cardiac electrical cycle
[2023-01-03 18:16:57] <Frag_Magnet_> It can happen in baseball. Get hit on the right stroke of the heart
[2023-01-03 18:16:57] <$storeboy84> blunt trauma to the chest.
[2023-01-03 18:16:57] <dwangy> nah
[2023-01-03 18:16:58] <+slimmrust> They have him sedated so theyâre prolly just monitoring. If you get hit at a certain time in the heart the electric waves will get fucked up and can throw it into afib

[2023-01-03 19:24:24] <%Beartoxth> works best with ironsights, helps with the bounceness in moving while aiming

[2023-01-03 19:26:46] <%SteremyJeele> Really wish this was an option. This is how most shooters work, or at least they give you the option.
[2023-01-03 19:26:48] <%alexcarp33> freedom isnt free
[2023-01-03 19:26:48] <%$LichhD2> klean wants everything removed lol

[2023-01-03 19:26:51] <%rickrollwolf> you can free look while ADS'd again!!!??? i am coming back to tarkov!!!
[2023-01-03 19:26:53] <+themanghoul> bad take
[2023-01-03 19:26:57] <%rEgUlArdUtchnUtmUlkEnjOyr> thats a klean take
[2023-01-03 19:26:59] <+winterowl90> Klean bitches about everything whatâs new
[2023-01-03 19:26:59] <IamStrifeGaming> Klean has some takes. LOL

[2023-01-03 19:27:00] <%DubssOnly> Iâd kill for that tape measure
[2023-01-03 19:27:02] <@%LogicalSolutions> Free look in Tarkov sucks. It locks up all the time and you canât look over your shoulder. Itâs just used to free look sprint past doors/bhop for unimmersive Chad movement. The game would be better without it.
[2023-01-03 19:27:06] <%+csCINNABUNS> dude
[2023-01-03 19:27:06] <%Zumwar> Removing freelook would be dumb as hell for a realistic shooter lmao
[2023-01-03 19:27:07] <dbarss> he made a video about it
[2023-01-03 19:27:09] <%$king_kob_the_corn_king> @jon_trihard certain ammo types have crazy camera recoil that makes it hasrd to hit follow up shots
[2023-01-03 19:27:11] <%+DeadlySideAffect> Let Klean play dungeons and dragons. Heâs the worst
[2023-01-03 19:27:12] <%RapidlyAgingOldFart> he thinks its only used for unimmersive chad shit
[2023-01-03 19:27:12] <unclebarryog> thats dumb, your able to look around like that irl why  shouldnt it be in game
[2023-01-03 19:27:25] <+winterowl90> Klean is a cry baby
[2023-01-03 19:27:25] <2bucks69> does klean even play tarkov anymore
[2023-01-03 19:27:26] <%nicymo> Exact tweet: Just found one of the best quality of life changes in Tarkov and itâs a glitch. Not like a exploit or anything. But just a nice QoL change that should be an i game setting.
[2023-01-03 19:27:32] <%+old_gweg> Klean is a penis pump
[2023-01-03 19:27:32] <%monkimonki_> thats actually a good point

[2023-01-03 19:29:07] <%frnk_> i mean, theres gonna be a new meta right after that but lets just hope its a better one @Trey24k
[2023-01-03 19:29:09] <iiAmAnt> newbie here - how do you right hand peak like that
[2023-01-03 19:29:10] <tonygp_> recoil needs to be fixed second shot recoil is stupid
[2023-01-03 19:29:11] <2bucks69> god dam meta GAMER!
[2023-01-03 19:29:17] <+DrLilNut> wait what did klean do lol
[2023-01-03 19:29:17] <%+ips626> is the lightkeeper cute?
[2023-01-03 19:29:22] <%+PopeRonPaul> they need to finally add shouldering from the left shoulder so you can left-hand peek
[2023-01-03 19:29:23] <%jfxentreri> it's called an exploit chat get lernt
[2023-01-03 19:29:23] <%+SkinnyVans> twitch being broken is breaking drops too. Time to mald
[2023-01-03 19:29:24] <Ogchampayne> they just have to add changing shoulders idk why they havent
[2023-01-03 19:29:27] <%SteremyJeele> Klean just wants the game to be more realistic, which is what BSG keeps saying they want. But then they make decisions and mechanics that completely counter that.
[2023-01-03 19:29:28] <%+shobbzane> Asmongold talks about it all the time. You always take advantage of the bugs.
[2023-01-03 19:29:30] <%CheekyTransGirl> Add ganja to Tarkov pvperEz
[2023-01-03 19:29:30] <%Zumwar> Well, you did say shoreline would be the dumbest for this quest lol
[2023-01-03 19:29:30] <%meatman24k> anyone else have twitch just shit out?  drops are gon
[2023-01-03 19:29:32] <+hnep1> I'm sure you talked about it, but, thoughts on propital no longer being a painkiller?
[2023-01-03 19:29:32] <%+shobbzane> It just makes sense
[2023-01-03 19:29:34] <%+TheCrazedBanana> If they don't want the fov abused maybe they should fix it?
[2023-01-03 19:29:35] <CosmicRequiemNA> i used the bhop jump rengawr made a video on last wipe still thought it was dumb af
[2023-01-03 19:29:39] <%nicymo> Klean is like the Stephen A Smith of tarkov as far as hot takes go lol

[2023-01-03 19:29:43] <its_just_june> What do you mean recoil needs to be fixed
[2023-01-03 19:29:47] <%tacoboutit_> facts. its part of tarkov gameplay culture, you can hate the right peak and still use it since its the best way to fight in pvp lol
[2023-01-03 19:29:50] <+MatchedPlayr> Nobody does it better than Tarkov, but nobody does it worse OMEGALUL
[2023-01-03 19:29:53] <%EZ_E_32> Not sure about lightkeeper but @trey24k be Lookinâ cute.
[2023-01-03 19:29:54] <%+Drillsrgt52> yup twitch is fucked
[2023-01-03 19:29:56] <The_Spaghett_Boy> I still think there should be a button to swap which shoulder your using so everyone can benefit from âright side peakâ on both sides
[2023-01-03 19:29:57] <+pgwolfy> should just ue blue bloods instead of props

[2023-01-03 20:44:01] <csjoe420> do you think they should add a boat extract to the lighthouse island, like the one on shoreline?
[2023-01-03 20:44:01] <+WrangleRz> anyone knows if d-2 extract button (the one thats open the wall) has time now like bunker exit (that u have 5min to reach the extract)? Because sometimes also if the power is activated button cant be pressed (near the wall) so exit is locked.

[2023-01-03 20:45:16] <%nicymo> @wranglerz the doorway into the physical extract space just glitches and makes no noise. So as long as power is on and you hit button the extract will open and you wait a few seconds before walking through the door.
