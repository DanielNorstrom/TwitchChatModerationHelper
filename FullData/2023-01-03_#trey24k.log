I just thought maybe it’d be fun to roleplay with you as your online gf maybe? I know you’re straight. I’m a boy that’s why I was saying roleplay.. this isn’t a troll. again, I know it’s really random and weird. I’m sorry. It would just be a fun online relationship - nothing serious and I could donate to you and your stream and support you

[2023-01-03 02:31:25] <Rapanui_> @xrkzhukovski they were going to tow her car, and I assume she is poor, so it costs money. Then who knows if she can even get a ride to the place, let alone afford the tow.

[2023-01-03 03:20:41] <%30secondmains> @Trey24k  IV isnt typicaly that bad tbh most injuries you will be put on one just to keep u hydrated

[2023-01-03 03:23:32] <%+KamiKatz3> @snowman2314 Long Term Survival Rate after CPR isn't great tho. His Situation might be a bit brighter, since they started faster than usual i guess.

I’m a boy that’s why I was saying roleplay.. this isn’t a troll. again, I know it’s really random and weird. I’m sorry.

[2023-01-03 06:44:35] <%ColeChiIls> @metrize Have you spent the last 6 to 7 years coding an overly complicated game in Unity? LUL I get about venting I do. But what do you want? More content faster? I dont think its as simple as reee lead the devs better. Every game out has issues with content keeping up with the players. As far as I know though
[2023-01-03 06:44:44] <quacksacktey> why u keep them for last lol
[2023-01-03 06:44:45] <+GlenJam0> just go to woods tagged and cursed
[2023-01-03 06:44:45] <shananiginsoriginal> On woods the town next to the car extract you can melee scavs
[2023-01-03 06:44:46] <!%calebtothemax_> "if this tweet gets 6 likes i'll drop my onlyfans"
[2023-01-03 06:44:48] <%JakegotCakeO> power station
[2023-01-03 06:44:49] <$martimar77> tagged and cursed i guess
[2023-01-03 06:44:50] <%+AnActualDoggo> Scav town and bunker are ez in woods
[2023-01-03 06:44:50] <xGerk> shoreline power station and bus station
[2023-01-03 06:44:52] <+drakzmeister> @drakzmeister no way KEKW
[2023-01-03 06:44:53] <+Korrdaxx> shoreline at power station
[2023-01-03 06:44:53] <+codenamepa> shoreline is going to be the worst
[2023-01-03 06:44:53] <%ColeChiIls> Did you try the naked marked and cursed
[2023-01-03 06:44:56] <waitimdesyncd> resort on shoreline and village on woods its easy
[2023-01-03 06:44:56] <%Roloisanewb> a lil resort action?
[2023-01-03 06:44:57] <+Uncle_Cheddar> prob scav bunker area?
[2023-01-03 06:44:57] <%CranioDraven> @metrize there are players in the game that dont even stream that are nearly kappa promise
[2023-01-03 06:44:58] <%+ghost51fteen> shoot the scavs make them run inside of fob and scav house
[2023-01-03 06:45:00] <+ttstylez> whats the reward for this quest @Trey24k
[2023-01-03 06:45:01] <%General_HAM> Surely 2thy finishes those maps tonight :)
[2023-01-03 06:45:02] <+Vanillasoup_> @Trey24k rush power plant on shoreline prolly, on woods the northern village?
[2023-01-03 06:45:04] <%JakegotCakeO> bet?
[2023-01-03 06:45:05] <chivo_502> need to watch that one movie the patriot
[2023-01-03 06:45:05] <+cantreLs> The scavs in the little cabins
[2023-01-03 06:45:06] <%sleepgoat> +1
[2023-01-03 06:45:09] <+Tethtizan> woods, u can bait the scavs around the hunter shack and use it for cover
[2023-01-03 06:45:11] <+tweddy01> ResidentSleeper
[2023-01-03 06:45:11] <%ucir> whats that thing in ur special slot
[2023-01-03 06:45:14] <sisoly> How much for acc reset?
[2023-01-03 06:45:14] <+Budgt> shorleline should be easy just go tagged and cursed but idk about woods
[2023-01-03 06:45:15] <+tweddy01> Kreygasm
[2023-01-03 06:45:15] <%+ghost51fteen> +1 make 2hy do it
[2023-01-03 06:45:17] <%+JediMindTricks_TV> @Trey24k Do woods and Shoreline on night raid with NVG. Sneak attack
[2023-01-03 06:45:18] <waitimdesyncd> village on woods has 10 scavs u can melee in the houses alone
[2023-01-03 06:45:18] <metrize> @colechiils yeah you're right, but it's a consistent failure on their part so it's just annoying. what can you do though
[2023-01-03 06:45:19] <Faraksiss> How's it going trey
[2023-01-03 06:45:24] <!%calebtothemax_> you gotta do it
[2023-01-03 06:45:26] <!%calebtothemax_> <3
[2023-01-03 06:45:27] <%Roloisanewb> 2thy 100% finishes the melee kills while you are sleeping
[2023-01-03 06:45:32] <doinkbadoink> nah just 360 em off of spine
[2023-01-03 06:45:32] <+durzobluntt> so when do u get lightkeeper missions?
[2023-01-03 06:45:36] <+ThumblessStick> Have you killed lightkeepers fuck boy?
[2023-01-03 06:45:43] VIEWERS: 3 798
[2023-01-03 06:45:49] <+GlenJam0> when you do woods you could just go tagged and cursed
[2023-01-03 06:45:52] <+Vanillasoup_> ill gift 10 if you can manage to melee shturman lmfao
[2023-01-03 06:45:59] <quacksacktey> honestly if you just suicide rush the scavs with a 9mil and a melee its quick
[2023-01-03 06:46:02] <metrize> @craniodraven yeah I can imagine tbh even in China and places that don't stream on twitch necessarily
[2023-01-03 06:46:11] <Sc0tty2Hotty91> So does the new transmitter work on the new mines they added above Building three as well in deactivating. Or just lighthouse? @trey24k
[2023-01-03 06:46:12] <+Boz____> kappa still 55?
[2023-01-03 06:46:20] <%ucir> i feel like 2thy would do this quest he such a troll
[2023-01-03 06:46:22] <BigPurple7> harrison gonna fall again
[2023-01-03 06:46:30] <alpacayarn> aqua did it
[2023-01-03 06:46:35] <metrize> would be cool if it gets confirmed first kappa by Nikita or something tho  Pog
[2023-01-03 06:46:39] <!%+CryingShamus> Is this the Sub machine gun in the shrimp caliber?
[2023-01-03 06:46:39] <%ColeChiIls> @metrize Nothing at all really. Ive been seeing the same complaints since alpha man. People literally crying about artist not fixing netcode, and coders not designing maps. People crying cuz game is too arcadey or too hard, crying that theres too much x content and not enough y. Its kinda funny at this point LUL
[2023-01-03 06:46:43] <%+thec_man2000> great youtube video my guy
[2023-01-03 06:46:44] <+Vanillasoup_> i was sniping on woods today and shturman got triggered by my suppressed dvl, and tapped me all the way by the medical base OMEGALUL

[2023-01-03 18:15:46] <%SteremyJeele> I think vitals just means like blood pressure, oxygen and heart rate. But his vitals would not be good if he wasn't intubated.

[2023-01-03 18:16:57] <bhatch145> its a really rare condition that only happens when you get hit at a very precise time in the cardiac electrical cycle
[2023-01-03 18:16:57] <Frag_Magnet_> It can happen in baseball. Get hit on the right stroke of the heart
[2023-01-03 18:16:57] <$storeboy84> blunt trauma to the chest.
[2023-01-03 18:16:57] <dwangy> nah
[2023-01-03 18:16:58] <+slimmrust> They have him sedated so they’re prolly just monitoring. If you get hit at a certain time in the heart the electric waves will get fucked up and can throw it into afib

[2023-01-03 18:17:20] <+DrHendric> Hey Trey, what are your thoughts on the new audio? I feel like it was better before the changes
[2023-01-03 18:17:21] <%3oo3ies> Rip rip for sure
[2023-01-03 18:17:21] <Wyzed> The timing of when he got hit messed up the rhythm of the heart. No prior heart condition
[2023-01-03 18:17:25] <bonesshow87> He didn't have a cardiac problem... its a condition called Commotio Cordis... very unique situation... when an athlete gets hit at the perfect time of depolarization of the heart.
[2023-01-03 18:17:25] <+NoobNugget92> yeah but ken block died and thats sad
[2023-01-03 18:17:25] <%SteremyJeele> Had two major surgeries and he's in the ICU now.

[2023-01-03 18:18:43] <%+LichhD2> Cheer100 what happened to Hamlin is called Commotio cordis. Happens when a blow to the heart happens when it is in resting and causes it to stop. The timing has to be perfect. Its very rare.

[2023-01-03 19:26:44] <@%LogicalSolutions> he doesnt free look at all
[2023-01-03 19:26:46] <zencetv> @LeShades yeah thats false
[2023-01-03 19:26:46] <+frosty_skullz> klean is a npc
[2023-01-03 19:26:46] <%nicymo> He tweeted it
[2023-01-03 19:26:46] <its_just_june> Wtf
[2023-01-03 19:26:46] <%SteremyJeele> Really wish this was an option. This is how most shooters work, or at least they give you the option.
[2023-01-03 19:26:48] <%alexcarp33> freedom isnt free
[2023-01-03 19:26:48] <%$LichhD2> klean wants everything removed lol
[2023-01-03 19:26:49] <+LilTaisu> dumb af lol
[2023-01-03 19:26:51] <+TopGrifter> That sight would be perfect for this
[2023-01-03 19:26:51] <%rickrollwolf> you can free look while ADS'd again!!!??? i am coming back to tarkov!!!
[2023-01-03 19:26:53] <+themanghoul> bad take
[2023-01-03 19:26:57] <%rEgUlArdUtchnUtmUlkEnjOyr> thats a klean take
[2023-01-03 19:26:59] <+winterowl90> Klean bitches about everything what’s new
[2023-01-03 19:26:59] <IamStrifeGaming> Klean has some takes. LOL
[2023-01-03 19:26:59] <+LilTaisu> cant move your head around KEKW
[2023-01-03 19:27:00] <%DubssOnly> I’d kill for that tape measure
[2023-01-03 19:27:02] <@%LogicalSolutions> Free look in Tarkov sucks. It locks up all the time and you can’t look over your shoulder. It’s just used to free look sprint past doors/bhop for unimmersive Chad movement. The game would be better without it.
[2023-01-03 19:27:06] <%+csCINNABUNS> dude
[2023-01-03 19:27:06] <%Zumwar> Removing freelook would be dumb as hell for a realistic shooter lmao
[2023-01-03 19:27:07] <dbarss> he made a video about it
[2023-01-03 19:27:09] <%$king_kob_the_corn_king> @jon_trihard certain ammo types have crazy camera recoil that makes it hasrd to hit follow up shots
[2023-01-03 19:27:11] <%+DeadlySideAffect> Let Klean play dungeons and dragons. He’s the worst
[2023-01-03 19:27:12] <%RapidlyAgingOldFart> he thinks its only used for unimmersive chad shit
[2023-01-03 19:27:12] <unclebarryog> thats dumb, your able to look around like that irl why  shouldnt it be in game
[2023-01-03 19:27:25] <+winterowl90> Klean is a cry baby
[2023-01-03 19:27:25] <2bucks69> does klean even play tarkov anymore
[2023-01-03 19:27:26] <%nicymo> Exact tweet: Just found one of the best quality of life changes in Tarkov and it’s a glitch. Not like a exploit or anything. But just a nice QoL change that should be an i game setting.
[2023-01-03 19:27:32] <%+old_gweg> Klean is a penis pump
[2023-01-03 19:27:32] <%monkimonki_> thats actually a good point
[2023-01-03 19:27:32] <%ciditi> i free look all the time IRL without moving my body
[2023-01-03 19:27:34] <%nato4r> yeah it's shit
[2023-01-03 19:27:36] <%alexcarp33> these dono sounds are gettin too realistic
[2023-01-03 19:27:38] <%monkimonki_> thats not realist
[2023-01-03 19:27:39] <its_just_june> Agreed

[2023-01-03 19:29:10] <tonygp_> recoil needs to be fixed second shot recoil is stupid

[2023-01-03 19:29:17] <%+ips626> is the lightkeeper cute?
[2023-01-03 19:29:22] <%+PopeRonPaul> they need to finally add shouldering from the left shoulder so you can left-hand peek
[2023-01-03 19:29:23] <%jfxentreri> it's called an exploit chat get lernt
[2023-01-03 19:29:23] <%+SkinnyVans> twitch being broken is breaking drops too. Time to mald
[2023-01-03 19:29:24] <Ogchampayne> they just have to add changing shoulders idk why they havent
[2023-01-03 19:29:27] <%SteremyJeele> Klean just wants the game to be more realistic, which is what BSG keeps saying they want. But then they make decisions and mechanics that completely counter that.
[2023-01-03 19:29:28] <%+shobbzane> Asmongold talks about it all the time. You always take advantage of the bugs.
[2023-01-03 19:29:30] <%CheekyTransGirl> Add ganja to Tarkov pvperEz

[2023-01-03 19:29:32] <+hnep1> I'm sure you talked about it, but, thoughts on propital no longer being a painkiller?
[2023-01-03 19:29:32] <%+shobbzane> It just makes sense
[2023-01-03 19:29:34] <%+TheCrazedBanana> If they don't want the fov abused maybe they should fix it?

[2023-01-03 19:29:43] <its_just_june> What do you mean recoil needs to be fixed
[2023-01-03 19:29:47] <%tacoboutit_> facts. its part of tarkov gameplay culture, you can hate the right peak and still use it since its the best way to fight in pvp lol
[2023-01-03 19:29:50] <+MatchedPlayr> Nobody does it better than Tarkov, but nobody does it worse OMEGALUL
[2023-01-03 19:29:53] <%EZ_E_32> Not sure about lightkeeper but @trey24k be Lookin’ cute.

[2023-01-03 19:29:56] <The_Spaghett_Boy> I still think there should be a button to swap which shoulder your using so everyone can benefit from “right side peak” on both sides

[2023-01-03 20:44:01] <+WrangleRz> anyone knows if d-2 extract button (the one thats open the wall) has time now like bunker exit (that u have 5min to reach the extract)? Because sometimes also if the power is activated button cant be pressed (near the wall) so exit is locked.

[2023-01-03 22:20:37] <mushroom4> MD self defense laws require you to have no other option besides shooting, meaning you have to try to remove yourself from the scenario first

[2023-01-03 23:24:27] <%SteremyJeele> Worth a report. If BSG finally does something about the cheating problem, we won't need to report so much.
[2023-01-03 23:24:31] <+speccsyttv> wont get banned if he was cheating SADGE
[2023-01-03 23:24:32] <%Zumwar> Sadge
[2023-01-03 23:24:33] <fake_based> if you have a twitch channel you probably are cheating, the biggest streamers on this platform have been caught for cheating in CoD dozens of times

[2023-01-03 23:25:34] <fake_based> There are so many cheaters in this game, the cheaters pay the bills for BSG buy buying EoD accounts on repeat
[2023-01-03 23:25:34] <%SteremyJeele> Exactly. Not absolutely hacking, but more than possible he could've been.
[2023-01-03 23:25:34] <theFecesphantom> techlight camper man
