[2022-12-28 12:34:52] <hgr126> yea, the 4s kill hog tech , cant get it

[2022-12-28 12:35:21] <wruvv> are you playing any ramattra? he's the most fun ive had with tank since hamster released
[2022-12-28 12:35:36] <%Spitfire2k6> Morning kragiee
[2022-12-28 12:35:41] <%TheFitnessGamer> so recharge armour before you pop ult?
[2022-12-28 12:35:42] <fatracooncat> so tank mode, normal mode and than ult
[2022-12-28 12:35:56] <%sp33dyal> You should he's nice
[2022-12-28 12:36:02] <%sp33dyal> if only he wasn't this overtuned though
[2022-12-28 12:36:29] <wruvv> i wish there were more transformation ults
[2022-12-28 12:36:41] <hxghesyy> hey kragie hows it going?:)
[2022-12-28 12:36:45] <caliQe> 225hp in armor is busted, it'd be fine it was overhealth only
[2022-12-28 12:36:50] <wruvv> i feel like hog and especially orissa fuck ramattra pretty hard
[2022-12-28 12:36:50] <%Spitfire2k6> Next hero will be purchasable apex style, this battle pass unlock was just a trial run. P2W game soon™
[2022-12-28 12:36:54] <%TheFitnessGamer> it's a good move that they buff others to help balance things out a little no?
[2022-12-28 12:36:55] <caliQe> armour does too much
[2022-12-28 12:37:11] VIEWERS: 24
[2022-12-28 12:37:11] <ipovx> fun? i think its meta to play/boring to play
[2022-12-28 12:37:18] <wruvv> i just want junker queen to be buffed :(
[2022-12-28 12:37:36] <biglavacake> @kragiee romanian deadlift to this song
[2022-12-28 12:37:38] <biglavacake> does*
[2022-12-28 12:37:46] <%TheFitnessGamer> probably not till season 6 or 8 for dps im sure
[2022-12-28 12:37:49] <wruvv> the orissa rework was really good too imo
[2022-12-28 12:37:53] <fatracooncat> they said what the next three would be right? like what class
[2022-12-28 12:37:54] <ipovx> next one will be healer in april i think
[2022-12-28 12:38:08] <%TheFitnessGamer> season 4 is a support hero again right?
[2022-12-28 12:38:23] <%Spitfire2k6> Sure we just got Sojourn
[2022-12-28 12:38:42] <ipovx> they said every 4heroes would be 2 healers 1dps 1tank
[2022-12-28 12:38:52] <%TheFitnessGamer> makes sense i guess, based on numbers. support is quite small
[2022-12-28 12:38:56] <razed36> kragie do you find widow fun
[2022-12-28 12:38:56] <frostwind88> Poh

[2022-12-28 12:38:58] <+Fuuskey> Love the queue times in overwatch

[2022-12-28 12:39:16] <wruvv> thoughts on giving zen the big jump he had in that one experimental last year?
[2022-12-28 12:39:26] <fatracooncat> @TheFitnessGamer yeah, but also not interesting enough for most, always short on support
[2022-12-28 12:39:28] <ipovx> @Fuuskey NUMBER 1 IN EVERYTHING RAHHH
[2022-12-28 12:39:29] <%TheFitnessGamer> makes the already hard job of balancing even harder no?
[2022-12-28 12:39:29] <frostwind88> because they need to make skins for those amazing bundles
[2022-12-28 12:39:36] <%Spitfire2k6> The can't balance the 36 they have now
[2022-12-28 12:39:49] <%+thebrisket49> support needs the love though. they have like 2 heroes to choose from lol
[2022-12-28 12:39:54] <%Spitfire2k6> And you want one a season? EleGiggle
[2022-12-28 12:40:03] <wruvv> @Spitfire2k6 i feel like besides tank balance it's not that bad
[2022-12-28 12:40:03] <frostwind88> 14 bucks for that Genji skin is the best bargain you can ever get
[2022-12-28 12:40:10] <%TheFitnessGamer> @fatracooncat i agree, not the most exciting role as a whole
[2022-12-28 12:40:18] <diablozooo> hey dude how you doing
[2022-12-28 12:40:20] <ipovx> 22$ WOW
[2022-12-28 12:40:41] <wruvv> @thebrisket49 every game is either kiriko mercy or kiriko ana lmao
[2022-12-28 12:40:45] <Apuphis> tips to improve your aim?
[2022-12-28 12:40:53] <frostwind88> @kragiee i heared that they sue Blizzard for these sales. because the discounted prize is the "real" prize, and since everything is always on sale, its just manipulation
[2022-12-28 12:40:53] <Apuphis> and hi
[2022-12-28 12:40:57] <fatracooncat> @TheFitnessGamer I mean I love playing support, I main zen and moira but I do see the lack of excitement in my friend groups
[2022-12-28 12:40:59] <frostwind88> not sure what was the outcome
[2022-12-28 12:41:11] VIEWERS: 191
[2022-12-28 12:41:18] <wruvv> @frostwind88 EU or USA?
[2022-12-28 12:41:29] <frostwind88> i dont remember the details
[2022-12-28 12:41:37] <%TheFitnessGamer> @fatracooncat if i do end up playing support it's mostly just for Ana really
[2022-12-28 12:41:39] <frostwind88> but EU is usually more strict
[2022-12-28 12:41:52] <%+thebrisket49> they need to be sued over these queue times
[2022-12-28 12:42:01] <ipovx> 20$ FOR 1 SKIN FOR 1 HERO OF 35 HEROES
[2022-12-28 12:42:12] <wruvv> @frostwind88 yeah but i feel like a lot of times american companies dont listen to EU :(
[2022-12-28 12:42:22] <fatracooncat> @TheFitnessGamer I only play casual as I'm not good enough for comp so zen and moira can be pretty good
[2022-12-28 12:42:23] <razed36> do you have any tips to get better at tracer
[2022-12-28 12:42:56] <wruvv> make the skins 200€ but keep the heroes free

[2022-12-28 12:43:26] <frostwind88> dont know man, i played like 2 days in S1, and that was it. this game is just a cosmetics simulator, at least for me
[2022-12-28 12:43:41] <wruvv> @TheFitnessGamer they need to give him the charge jump he had in the OW1 experimental
[2022-12-28 12:43:48] <1000kronersgabriel> siuuu Kragie gl
[2022-12-28 12:43:53] <fatracooncat> @TheFitnessGamer it's amazing, ord of discord, charge fire and a kick and I can get close to killing a lot of tanks

[2022-12-28 12:44:11] <%+thebrisket49> tanks are so over tuned still man
[2022-12-28 12:44:15] <razed36> its kind of sad that people were complaining about loot boxes but would rather have them than the current system

[2022-12-28 12:45:42] <wruvv> i hope every other season, if they don't release new characters, they do character reworks
[2022-12-28 12:45:52] <ninelie08> why they so shit at balancing? ow isnt their first pvp game
[2022-12-28 12:45:55] <ipovx> yeah but make the curenccy farmable

[2022-12-28 12:48:52] <razed36> @TheKiki7 fr solo queing dps the game is already decided based on the tank you have
[2022-12-28 12:48:58] <ninelie08> @wruvv its not powercreep we just dont have much option to begin with

[2022-12-28 16:19:51] <+Red__Rain> one thing i wish Overwatch does it migrate to how other FPS's deal with Recoil. They did it for solider but no one else. Give us the ability to control recoil(Bastion, Sojourn, Widow, wrecking ball, Ashe) Feels bad to rely on spam spread
[2022-12-28 16:20:10] <seaskythe> doesn't beaver used to be a Hammond one trick?

[2022-12-28 16:23:53] <%+TheSickInfluenza> @Red__Rain i agree with you, its better to have recoil(which you can control) instead of rng spread
