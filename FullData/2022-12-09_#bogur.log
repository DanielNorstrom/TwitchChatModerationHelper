[2022-12-09 10:40:09] <!%MapleRoar> Phase out the support players and give everyone the support passive

[2022-12-09 10:40:39] <%ian11232324> just bring back release brig
[2022-12-09 10:41:15] <%BallinDani> the balance is fucked already peepoShrug
[2022-12-09 10:41:17] <!%MapleRoar> Even if you just power shift parts of their kit to mix things up
[2022-12-09 10:41:45] <Parandroid> @bogur they should have given the speed passive to supports instead of DPS, and for healing. So you heal, you get 15% speed to run away from the flankers :P

[2022-12-09 10:42:23] <!%MapleRoar> This patch for support is such a slap in the face it's almost funny
[2022-12-09 10:42:36] VIEWERS: 55
[2022-12-09 10:43:08] <%BallinDani> especially since they were talking about reworking the entire role for this season @MapleRoar Shruge

[2022-12-09 10:43:22] <Parandroid> @bogur we got kiriko and nerfs
[2022-12-09 10:43:27] <!%MapleRoar> The worst part is they tried out a moira rework, it got bad feedback so they had a tantrum and threw the entire idea out
[2022-12-09 10:43:33] <Parandroid> and mercy superjump rework
[2022-12-09 10:43:54] <%ian11232324> I thought support was a top priority
[2022-12-09 10:43:55] <borodjonok> errytime i click here no kiss (¬¥‚à©œâ‚à©ÔΩÄ)
[2022-12-09 10:44:02] <Parandroid> yeah, then only nerfs, brig no stun and mercy superjump
[2022-12-09 10:44:05] <%BallinDani> @ian11232324 so was ball apparently OMEGALUL
[2022-12-09 10:44:09] <Parandroid> that is all what changed for supports

[2022-12-09 10:44:38] <%BallinDani> Stare hi
[2022-12-09 10:44:45] <Parandroid> @ian11232324 yes. but at their speed, we will get fix sometime in season 15, when there will be last 5 support players still playing the game
[2022-12-09 10:46:03] <%ian11232324> is this the same balance team that took 4 months to get SJ right
[2022-12-09 10:46:03] <@^Nightbot> N OMEGALUL
[2022-12-09 10:46:20] <%BallinDani> @ian11232324 sj isn't right.
[2022-12-09 10:46:36] VIEWERS: 53
[2022-12-09 10:46:38] <forcing_it> junker queens shout should give 25 health per teammate in its range that way if you use it pre-emptively as a team player there is a bigger buff for teammates. (100 health)
[2022-12-09 10:46:51] <Parandroid> the real issue is that Blizz doesn't know what to do with older heroes who do not fit OW2 that much. It is an issue with other roles as well, but it is made much bigger for support because we literally have a fraction of hero pool, and with current patch you are literally stuck with 3 viable options (kiriko, lucio, moira). The rest can be made work, but hard to get use from

[2022-12-09 11:26:08] <@^Nightbot> Of course bogur has a circular window! You might think it is a bad architectural design a circular window seperating the bedroom from the kitchen but it actually serves a great purpose. It allows the person on the bed to view the people in the kitchen without all the smells and sounds coming through. The circular window motives bogur to get up, be happy, and play winston Monke

In the bogur experience, you get the following: An experience where the streamer is in a constant state of mental balance between sanity and complete and utter insanity. Have you ever seen a man expereince a complete descent into madness? You get that here every 2 days! (or whenever pigeon is in chat). We also have a wonderful chat with so many cosmetic moderators.

[2022-12-09 13:51:45] <+DaylightDemon> its so funny to me that ppl of lower ranks think that generally speaking, they will think their teammates are good at the game and they will be in "better " matches.
[2022-12-09 13:51:47] <%EyreOW> I think I can throw games too
[2022-12-09 13:52:00] <%comfyshane> I only carry games when I'm in the zone, but usually I'm just shit
[2022-12-09 13:52:02] <+DaylightDemon> when they rank up
[2022-12-09 13:52:09] <%samxdesu> where was it? tasmania?
[2022-12-09 13:52:24] <Spyhy_> what Im getting at is that generally if you lose a game in masters, you didnt carry hard enough, but in gm even if play like the best player you will lose
[2022-12-09 13:52:27] <+DaylightDemon> i shit bricks every day

[2022-12-09 13:52:36] <%comfyshane> you can drive over a wombat in a 4x4 and it won't die
[2022-12-09 13:52:44] <BaardGoldstein> They have a split penis right? Female koalas have 2 vaginas
[2022-12-09 13:52:53] <Spyhy_> what was your winrate tho?
[2022-12-09 13:52:56] <Tuppelur> statistics
[2022-12-09 13:53:00] <TeeTeeXD> but skill is just relative to the lobby, a diamond player is "bad" compared to GM, but "cracked" in bronze
[2022-12-09 13:53:08] <!%AbsenceOW> its all about consistency
[2022-12-09 13:53:14] <Spyhy_> so you won every game until u hit rank 50?
[2022-12-09 13:53:15] <+DaylightDemon> @DaylightDemon tbf if you keep looking at your teammates too much you will never be happy in any rank bc 4 ppl make more mistakes than 1 person

[2022-12-09 13:58:05] <+DaylightDemon> it comes from the misunderstood thing that the matchmaker tries to find matches where your chance of winning is close to 50%
