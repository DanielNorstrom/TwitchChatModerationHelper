[2023-01-07 16:45:24] <RandleRains> How do NFTs get prices? A nonfungible token's floor price is initially determined during the minting process by the NFT project's founder or creator.
[2023-01-07 16:45:24] <+popepsychedelic> think of NFTs like a country club.  Some country clubs cost $100k a year to be a part of
[2023-01-07 16:45:28] <asmondrop_2> cryptozoo?
[2023-01-07 16:45:28] <@%$turtleTiff> i am
[2023-01-07 16:45:32] <%SenniVeera> what's up senniv1Love
[2023-01-07 16:45:33] <BronzyOW> People probably pay more if its coming from someone they like (streamer, artist, whatever).. so they price it for more knowing that people will buy it
[2023-01-07 16:45:33] <@%$turtleTiff> if you buy NFTs youre a dumbass
[2023-01-07 16:45:34] <lightzout_b> its fraud
[2023-01-07 16:45:40] <+Drowsy_Gamingg> @HisWattson what people are willing to pay , its just like regular art
[2023-01-07 16:45:41] <@%BESTGlRL> im knocking u cause why do u do that
[2023-01-07 16:45:45] <%sugurhoney> i an

[2023-01-07 16:45:49] <lightzout_b> buy low sell high, there is zero true value
[2023-01-07 16:45:49] <+you2sleepy> i made 4k on one
[2023-01-07 16:45:50] <DovahSheep_> It‚Äôs based on an artificial demand, which everyone just goes along with
[2023-01-07 16:45:51] <+sicknastylaney> Typically set a mint price at the start, and then from there those that buy it really decide if its worth more
[2023-01-07 16:45:54] <%+RadZacc> @BESTGlRL facts
[2023-01-07 16:45:56] <xxstewybrownxx> oh yeah but then its just a country club and you use it for what exactlyh
[2023-01-07 16:45:56] <%FURIA_Chase> that's what we're asking too
[2023-01-07 16:45:57] <swagstrfather420> Good job on. the tourney yesterday, dude
[2023-01-07 16:45:58] <lightzout_b> its all a scam
[2023-01-07 16:45:59] <xxstewybrownxx> nothing
[2023-01-07 16:46:01] <!%$SchugDoog> Agreed, tiff should heat up every nft holder
[2023-01-07 16:46:01] <Mayuwushii> why would i wanna own a picture GIGACHAD
[2023-01-07 16:46:02] <@%^Nightbot> because why not?
[2023-01-07 16:46:02] <bruhlifeshit> hi
[2023-01-07 16:46:04] <1Flammeus1> he thinks he owns a picture PepeLaugh
[2023-01-07 16:46:04] <Magron091294> well you actually own a code to a webpage that has the picture
[2023-01-07 16:46:05] <BronzyOW> Because people think the price is going to go up and they're going to profit
[2023-01-07 16:46:07] <lightzout_b> real art decorates a home

[2023-01-07 16:46:09] <@%$Zimpelll> TTours ctrl+c ctrl+v my nft now
[2023-01-07 16:46:11] <%Rehio> The end goal (supposedly) of NFTs isn't just pictures. It's supposed to be stuff like in-game items that you can trade because they belong to you.
[2023-01-07 16:46:13] <%Rehio> It's bullshit right now.
[2023-01-07 16:46:13] <RandleRains> kind of
[2023-01-07 16:46:14] <xxstewybrownxx> 49cents and ill copy all the nfts and send it to you
[2023-01-07 16:46:16] <+sicknastylaney> Its just like anything - its what people are willing to pay for
[2023-01-07 16:46:21] <xxstewybrownxx> nope its digital
[2023-01-07 16:46:21] <XersesTv> like you own a skin in game xD all pixels
[2023-01-07 16:46:24] <xxstewybrownxx> rgb
[2023-01-07 16:46:26] <+TimidRemi> its gotta be tangible
[2023-01-07 16:46:26] <+leo08606> they work on the Blockchain so they offer unique ownership
[2023-01-07 16:46:27] VIEWERS: 5¬†694
[2023-01-07 16:46:30] <xxstewybrownxx> 123 easy as you and me
[2023-01-07 16:46:30] <lightzout_b> you dont pay thousands for art at your house unless youre a super rich prick
[2023-01-07 16:46:32] <%A_PerfectEnd> Bored Ape
[2023-01-07 16:46:34] <@%BESTGlRL> thats different though cause if you own an actual piece of art you own the physical piece of it generally
[2023-01-07 16:46:35] <Quinis> nfts are just a pyramid scheme, there's no excuse - it's an excuse for the people who make em or buy em early to steal money from the rubes they convince to buy in later
[2023-01-07 16:46:35] <Waaasiebassie> more ppl that cannot watch on phone?
[2023-01-07 16:46:41] <%sugurhoney> not only is it a scam but its bad for the environment too
[2023-01-07 16:46:41] <raylangdivens> because you can verify ownership that's all. what makes paper money worth? jpg nfts are just proof of concept. real use cases are music artists sharing music, verifying ownership of a product, nfts of game skins you could trade to other gamers etc
[2023-01-07 16:46:43] <+leo08606> brands offer exclusive items and discounts etc to owners
[2023-01-07 16:46:44] <everydaywordle> NFTs basically scam who buy jpg for nothing
[2023-01-07 16:46:46] <%+VanViolence> i dont consider digital art as authentic art
[2023-01-07 16:46:47] <%+paracule_> if I have art, I own it, it's physical and tangible. NFT i just save as, and I have another one KEKW
[2023-01-07 16:46:51] <@%$turtleTiff> its not even art
[2023-01-07 16:46:53] <kcranberries13> What is your beef with art?
[2023-01-07 16:46:53] <+leo08606> it's just more consumerism lol
[2023-01-07 16:46:53] <+sicknastylaney> The bigger NFT projects you can sell the rights to movies, shows etc and get royalties
[2023-01-07 16:46:53] <Diorrdio> you dont own the picture itself tho, you own a link to a webpage with the picture
[2023-01-07 16:46:55] <+lolawyer> nft = digital collectible
[2023-01-07 16:46:56] <%+fadedwithfader> you also get access to private events, meetings, networking opportunities
[2023-01-07 16:46:59] <cheesaphobia> fuck nfts

[2023-01-07 16:47:00] <+mlynch89> It's not like regular art. It's a spot on a block chain. It's a scam.

[2023-01-07 17:04:54] <xEmperorOvaltine> I like this split, I just think there needs to be a KP cap
[2023-01-07 17:04:57] <%+mkaplan13_> current system is decent
[2023-01-07 17:04:59] <GooseGod1278> no. Grinding that was a 2nd job
[2023-01-07 17:05:00] <C_Beta_yeeyee> kinda
[2023-01-07 17:05:00] <joedirtisunderrated> It was awesome, they just shouldn‚Äôt have dropped everyone two tiers since demotion existed

[2023-01-07 17:05:01] <+ginjaninja9871> yes

[2023-01-07 17:05:08] <thejonathan24> broken moon sucks ass so cant compare lol
[2023-01-07 17:05:10] <solo_grinder831> Any season map better than this one reminds me of advance warfare
[2023-01-07 17:05:10] <InfinityESQ> What is the difference to season 13?
[2023-01-07 17:05:11] <joedirtisunderrated> Led to a bunch of people in wrong tier for too long
[2023-01-07 17:05:14] <+River2463> No because this map was new to everyone
[2023-01-07 17:05:21] <@%$Zimpelll> endgames were way more fun
[2023-01-07 17:05:24] <%ralieghwhite> Maybe more points for placement and somewhat high KP cap??
[2023-01-07 17:05:26] <@%BESTGlRL> that season did favor anyone but the 1% and theres no way this whole chat is the 1%

[2023-01-07 17:05:30] <Bucketz> It was better but it sucked solo/duo imo because the lobbies were harder
[2023-01-07 17:05:30] <goukibuki> as a viewer, yes. As a casual playing, no...too grindy
[2023-01-07 17:05:30] DELETED: name1300455 (—è –Ω–µ —É –º—é –ø–∏—Å–∞—Ç—å –ø–æ –∞–Ω–≥–ª–∏–π—Å–∫–∏–π.)
[2023-01-07 17:05:30] <+Rowijoe> as a player it felt way way better, as a viewer the chaos of constant 3rd and 4th party fights is nuts to watch
[2023-01-07 17:05:33] <@%BESTGlRL> didnt favor*
[2023-01-07 17:05:34] <supersaiyajin64> It was good before because only good players were in high ranks

[2023-01-07 17:05:41] <Fejjy01> Wasnt S13 the same system as rn?
[2023-01-07 17:05:42] <Crashswizzy> storm point was goated on release
[2023-01-07 17:05:43] <cybiosha_> what map was that one?
[2023-01-07 17:05:44] <misteryhunt> @hiswattson but bro, that was for 2hrs..
[2023-01-07 17:05:46] <Abexxx11> peak Apex
[2023-01-07 17:05:49] <solo_grinder831> Sniping was a thing
[2023-01-07 17:05:49] <asmondrop_2> cuz you were #1 then
[2023-01-07 17:05:52] <unexpectid> back when people cared about playing the game correctly
[2023-01-07 17:05:53] <%ralieghwhite> S13 S1 was super fun!
[2023-01-07 17:05:54] <@%$turtleTiff> bring back ranked reloaded
[2023-01-07 17:05:56] <Fejjy01> What changed on S13 to S14?
[2023-01-07 17:05:57] <@%SN0RLAXES> you and hal racing for rank 1 was the best ranked content since it launched
[2023-01-07 17:05:59] <+Nsight1> doesnt matter what the system is my randoms will throw it
[2023-01-07 17:06:01] <+strubes11> Which is your favorite map?
[2023-01-07 17:06:03] <Crashswizzy> Storm point was goat on release
[2023-01-07 17:06:04] <%+RadZacc> @BESTGlRL yeah but this map is so boring
[2023-01-07 17:06:04] <Abexxx11> @Fejjy01 no.
[2023-01-07 17:06:08] <@%$Zimpelll> it was so much more fun with 5 teams alive last circle
[2023-01-07 17:06:10] <KratosFonFabre> @Fejjy01 they made split 2 what it is right now kind of. split 1 was 90% placement based
[2023-01-07 17:06:10] <%+Twolittleorphans> AS a solo queuer it wasn't great
[2023-01-07 17:06:12] <InfinityESQ> What changed then?
[2023-01-07 17:06:13] <GlacierZeroOne> @bestglrl yeah people saying it are just regurgitating what their fav streamer says, casuals don‚Äôt like how hard that was
[2023-01-07 17:06:16] <%+PawBandito> It was good for high level players.
[2023-01-07 17:06:19] <@%BESTGlRL> @RadZacc he isnt asking for peoples opinion of the map tho
[2023-01-07 17:06:21] <supersaiyajin64> Only good players in high ranks @HisWattson
[2023-01-07 17:06:23] <goukibuki> so it played like pro scene
[2023-01-07 17:06:24] <+nightfury4tw> agreed
[2023-01-07 17:06:25] <Fejjy01> @kratosfonfabre i swear nothing changed
[2023-01-07 17:06:29] <+ChimpShits> it felt like playing tournaments every game because people actually played end game
[2023-01-07 17:06:29] <inspector_9> Thats how i felt about around time of season 6
[2023-01-07 17:06:32] VIEWERS: 6¬†059
[2023-01-07 17:06:35] <Fejjy01> @glacierzeroone wat diff between s13 split 1 and 2?
[2023-01-07 17:06:37] <%+RadZacc> @BESTGlRL but thats the map that this ranked split is played on
[2023-01-07 17:06:38] <easymoneyswipes> MIRAGE PLS WATTSO
[2023-01-07 17:06:38] <+zootyDOW> ü§ì
[2023-01-07 17:06:40] <unexpectid> yeah this season is stupid, you guys just horizon q and team wipe over and over. i still have fun in my lobbies tho
[2023-01-07 17:06:41] <Medjay_Mart> Dont think ive seen an endgame on broken moon
[2023-01-07 17:06:42] <@%$turtleTiff> thats what got me into watching apex
[2023-01-07 17:06:44] <asmondrop_2> trueee
[2023-01-07 17:06:44] <+leo08606> yeah but the hardstuck diamonds cried because they couldn't get past plat
[2023-01-07 17:06:51] <%+RadZacc> @BESTGlRL which influences my opinion on the split
[2023-01-07 17:06:54] <GlacierZeroOne> @fejjy01 not a whole lot more points for 14 and 12th place and +10 more points starting out
[2023-01-07 17:06:54] <joedirtisunderrated> It was easily the best bc the end game was most like algs
[2023-01-07 17:06:56] <+RedactedRL> it just needs to be something in between, atm there's just no reason not to ape
[2023-01-07 17:06:57] <@%SN0RLAXES> the only data they care about is skin sales
[2023-01-07 17:06:59] <Crashswizzy> Kraber 1 tapprd
[2023-01-07 17:07:01] <+TheGnapkin> I didn't make masters for the first time in S13, but it was the most fun I had
[2023-01-07 17:07:02] <+fantastic4skin69> you and Hal fighting for the number one was epic. Hal said the same thing
[2023-01-07 17:07:05] <%+Phil64> I think I like both possibilities. Now is constant fighting, season 13 was better at building hype. It was a build up to a crazy eruption at the end of each game
[2023-01-07 17:07:05] <@%$turtleTiff> @SN0RLAXES ^
[2023-01-07 17:07:09] <@%BESTGlRL> @GlacierZeroOne exactly LOL
[2023-01-07 17:07:12] <!%$SchugDoog> @sn0rlaxes I prefer stickers
[2023-01-07 17:07:12] <VLuigii> pretty sure less players played
[2023-01-07 17:07:26] <+Sarcoidosiz> what happend after season 13?
[2023-01-07 17:07:33] <san_playz> i havent played since season 10 what did they remove?
[2023-01-07 17:07:37] <%+PawBandito> @Sarcoidosiz yeah which is why they reverted it.
[2023-01-07 17:07:38] <misteryhunt> look at the event.. they give you stupid control back when the game is dying.. BUT HEY you can buy another heirloom dude

[2023-01-07 17:07:59] <@%$turtleTiff> @san_playz they removed kp caps and made it way harder to gain RP off of placement

[2023-01-07 17:08:06] <0aimer> this seasons ranked is like watching one long pub stomp
[2023-01-07 17:08:14] <GlacierZeroOne> @bestglrl yeah most players solo queue, I remember everyone crying about how hard ranked was and how solo queueing was impossible etc
[2023-01-07 17:08:19] <%ralieghwhite> It gets Smurfs out of low tier lobbies faster if you don‚Äôt have a KP cap, so it helps the casuals. Maybe??

[2023-01-07 17:09:23] <san_playz> @turtleTiff so thats why the ranked scene is just go for kills the last 2 seasons
[2023-01-07 17:09:24] <wawanbah> After 2 season, most people gonna say.. SEASON 15 IS THE BEST, Broken MOON POGW, mark my word... thats what happen with S13 S1

[2023-01-07 17:09:37] <xRobrt> nice shots
[2023-01-07 17:09:46] <GlacierZeroOne> @turtletiff solo queuing became much more manageable the season 13 split 2 when they made some minor adjustments
[2023-01-07 17:10:07] <+Drowsy_Gamingg> @HisWattson diamonds and up enjoyed it but plats and below hated it  (majority of player base ) so they reverted it

To prevent a costly overhaul of their equipment, these industrialists used their influence to stop Congress from adopting the metric system throughout the 19th

[2023-01-07 21:16:15] <9kaiju> the more you win the more consistent your ap gain, but you lose more when you lose
[2023-01-07 21:16:16] <Attitude> when you hit masters you only get +12

[2023-01-07 21:16:40] <9kaiju> DOM IS FUCKING TERRIBLE
[2023-01-07 21:16:45] <off_metas> arena is preformace based
[2023-01-07 21:16:48] <stephenfx101> its based of your overall win rate if u win more than u lose u get more RP when u win if u lose more than u win then u get 12 RP a win
[2023-01-07 21:16:49] <9kaiju> im actually tilting
[2023-01-07 21:16:50] <rollerisaimhacks> Chat is lying in plat in arenas and get plus 20 every game even if it‚Äôs 5 wins in arow
[2023-01-07 21:16:52] <off_metas> if you get hard carried its lower
[2023-01-07 21:16:59] <sir_knk> im like plat 3 rn but the win streak thing is correct
[2023-01-07 21:16:59] <jeauxlol> bro the #1 has over 40k ap
[2023-01-07 21:17:03] <%Hitosherizu> S0lve still carrying Wattos as usual?
[2023-01-07 21:17:04] <+adonisfx> nah i feel like it doesnt even matter cause im getting 12+ rp going against other preds and then +56 against diamonds i think its depending on solo queue vs 3 stack or so
[2023-01-07 21:17:05] <9kaiju> @rollerisaimhacks cause you're terrible mmr
