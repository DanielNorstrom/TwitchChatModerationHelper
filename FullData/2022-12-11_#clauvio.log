[2022-12-11 09:45:06] <BlueBlazeGX> Maybe you can find a good holiday deal on a new chair
[2022-12-11 09:45:13] <@%KafroHudrep> the stuffing is all gone. the fabric is worn out. there's a weird isopod growing out of it

[2022-12-11 09:45:33] <%MrFoois> enemy leather
[2022-12-11 09:45:41] <BlueBlazeGX> It's either PU leather, or another type that falls apart easier. Forget the name
[2022-12-11 09:45:42] <Nanodan_> how old is that chair watda doctag2Ogey
[2022-12-11 09:45:57] <holmcr0ss> Worn down by too many farts
[2022-12-11 09:46:03] <%GREEDRA> the stuff is coming off? I had that happen before and I cover chairs with throws now
[2022-12-11 09:46:19] <%GREEDRA> they're easier to wash

[2022-12-11 09:49:48] <@%KafroHudrep> the N64 controller had a separate accessory called the Rumble Pak that you needed to buy to have vibration added to your controller
[2022-12-11 09:49:55] <@%KafroHudrep> these days that's just built into most controller
[2022-12-11 09:50:01] <Turret49> Uhh, this be unplayable if your controller doesn't rumble?
[2022-12-11 09:50:07] <@%KafroHudrep> idk how the switch will interpret this though
[2022-12-11 09:50:16] <@%KafroHudrep> also no it's not required for the game
