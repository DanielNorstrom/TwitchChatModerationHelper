[2022-12-11 14:58:15] <@%ZHBot>* Standard blackjack rules, with the exception of a re-roll if the Streamer rolls the same number as you. 10, 11, 12, 13 = 10 (10, Jack, Queen & King). 1 = Ace (1 or 11 down to choice). If you roll over 21 you lose, same to the streamer.

[2022-12-11 15:42:22] <+Nevorax22> i want invention
[2022-12-11 15:42:22] <lordickwizard> and the survey they sent out months ago had loads on new skill content
[2022-12-11 15:42:35] <%+Purityyy> New skill would be very healthy for the game
[2022-12-11 15:42:41] <%+MinitureCandy> I'm tired of seeing people claim that a new skill will result in EoC
[2022-12-11 15:42:41] <%Keksbaer> new skill gonna be summoning x0r6ztGiggle
[2022-12-11 15:42:45] <$GrantOSRS> i think sailing could be easily integrated with slayer, hunter,. construction, crafting, i think it would be dope
[2022-12-11 15:42:50] <lordickwizard> i think sailing could be amazing especially with the players input

[2022-12-11 15:43:00] <+Hydrixx> that ruined the original rs
[2022-12-11 15:43:06] <%+MinitureCandy> I'd love a new skill. Preferably dungeoneering or something like Enchanting
[2022-12-11 15:43:15] <coolkulyk> no summoning but we have alts x0r6ztGiggle
[2022-12-11 15:43:17] <%+elitebird96> how boaty described sailing sounds alright but if its anything like player owned ports in RS3 id rather no new skill
[2022-12-11 15:43:44] <+dysfunctionahl> rs3 has too many distraction and diversions
[2022-12-11 15:43:50] <+dysfunctionahl> felt like i could never actually play the game
[2022-12-11 15:43:54] VIEWERS: 1 237
[2022-12-11 15:43:56] <%+Purityyy> I'd be okay with a ports mechanic integrated with it.
[2022-12-11 15:44:04] <+fluidised_hong> sailing confirmed?
[2022-12-11 15:44:13] <%Keksbaer> imagine not wanting your own port
[2022-12-11 15:44:13] <+Hydrixx> depending on level?
[2022-12-11 15:44:15] <%+MinitureCandy> @Hydrixx It really didn't though. It gave people a new resource to use which allowed devs to release more difficult conent

[2022-12-11 15:44:18] <bagggeds4> can i take it to puerto rico
[2022-12-11 15:44:20] <Niiroxis> it could pull requirements from all the production skills like con, smith, craft and stuff like that

[2022-12-11 15:44:30] <Weet_Je_Wel> rs3 kinda has that with uncharted isles
[2022-12-11 15:44:31] <%+Purityyy> So almost like Dungoneering + Temple Trekking?

[2022-12-11 15:46:18] <aryiz> they should make inscription - you make tablets and scrolls and also upgrade god books - effects both skilling and pvm
[2022-12-11 15:46:23] <wh8888> wait what? will there be a new skill?
[2022-12-11 15:46:25] <%+MinitureCandy> @Hydrixx I can respect that. I was a little unsure at first but I came to like it
[2022-12-11 15:46:27] <$lukeooo26> Brother Curtis GG on the BR was great to watch really entertaining. Thank you for your time 🙏🏼 @mmorpg
[2022-12-11 15:46:33] <%Senaeth> @Mmorpg what will happen if yes wins? Will they then throw up a poll with some pitches for a number of skills. e.g sailing, bard, dungeoneering and then whatever gets the most votes will be worked on?

[2022-12-11 15:46:37] <%LorTelevision> @Mmorpg can u shout out if there's a Flex platinum+ EUW player who would like to be our 5th for flex queue?
[2022-12-11 15:46:50] <sheriff_nottingham> if this poll passes will a skill be added regardless?
[2022-12-11 15:46:54] <mrmorshu> wow almost 90k votes
[2022-12-11 15:47:06] <%Keksbaer> the poll wont passed, too many close minded people who dont want new content
[2022-12-11 15:47:30] <therealtweny1savage> I've voted No on 6 accounts LUL don't want my 2277 to have anymore work involved
[2022-12-11 15:47:30] <@%OffKong> Feel like i have a perfect idea for a new skill
[2022-12-11 15:47:31] <%+MinitureCandy> Voting yes doesn't guarantee a new skill. It just starts the brainstorming process of what skills would be good
[2022-12-11 15:47:45] <%Keksbaer> @OffKong tell me
[2022-12-11 15:47:49] <%+Purityyy> assuming it passes, I dont think we'd have a new skill until 2024 at the earliest
[2022-12-11 15:47:49] <%LorTelevision> can u shout out if there's a Flex platinum+ EUW player who would like to be our 5th for flex queue? @Mmorpg

[2022-12-11 15:48:13] <+iron_duckkie> what about expanding on existing skills? sort of like 120s in rs3
[2022-12-11 15:48:14] <ImmuR> Tbh rs3 invention is the perfect skill, too bad it doesnt work in osrs
[2022-12-11 15:48:18] <+iron_duckkie> content past 99
[2022-12-11 15:48:19] <ImmuR> such a good item sink
[2022-12-11 15:48:24] <+chappy1G> i voted no because i dont wanna have to get a vene for my max cape back
[2022-12-11 15:48:34] <%LorTelevision> thanks boss
[2022-12-11 15:48:41] <%Senaeth> This poll is literally "Should we pour resources into a new skill or will it always fail anyway and we shouldnt bother with it?"
