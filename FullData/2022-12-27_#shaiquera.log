[2022-12-27 10:27:21] <Deus_Maximus> Voice is okay, video is a little laggy tho
[2022-12-27 10:27:31] <scal562> there is 30 more derelict outposts and crash site,   salvage mechanics, new drake vulture ship for salvaging, racetrack with PTV cars in Orison,,   orison has his atmosphere reduced to 90,000m instead of 150,000
[2022-12-27 10:27:38] <scal562> Gen12 for better optimisation
[2022-12-27 10:28:08] <scal562> new fps missions on orison,    ships ''soft death''  (mean you can desactivate a ship instead of blowing it up)
[2022-12-27 10:28:30] VIEWERS: 9
[2022-12-27 10:29:07] <scal562> and cargo refactore  (physical cargo box that you can move on the ship)
[2022-12-27 10:29:26] <scal562> and also, persistence universe
[2022-12-27 10:30:29] <scal562> like, if you leave and item somewhere, or a ship, or ship wreck, itll still be there when you come back there
[2022-12-27 10:30:30] VIEWERS: 9
[2022-12-27 10:31:27] <@+Bazzalis> That's weird the lag. Might have to come over during the holidays and see if I can figure anything out. If it was going fine before must be something to do with interaction with streaming software and game.
[2022-12-27 10:31:41] <scal562> is the Vsync on?
[2022-12-27 10:31:49] <scal562> you have to turn it Off
[2022-12-27 10:32:30] VIEWERS: 7
[2022-12-27 10:32:47] <scal562> hmm, might be the streaming software then
[2022-12-27 10:33:30] <manaholik> did you refresh your software  to recalibrate or something?
[2022-12-27 10:34:08] <Deus_Maximus> That's much better now
[2022-12-27 10:34:10] <@+Bazzalis> Oh that is smooth now.

[2022-12-27 10:35:25] <@+Bazzalis> That's how you fly space ships..... you need a hand up in the air.
[2022-12-27 10:35:40] <@+Bazzalis> It's like "I am going that way"

[2022-12-27 10:41:10] <scal562> did you leave cruise control on? xD
[2022-12-27 10:41:12] <@+Bazzalis> That is certainly a thing.
[2022-12-27 10:41:58] <@+Bazzalis> Yeah, I don't know why the lag left and then started again. That's weird.
[2022-12-27 10:42:05] <scal562> well cruise control just make your ship go forward, even if you get out the seat
[2022-12-27 10:42:26] <scal562> and if there was even a small pitch, your ship might have turned toward the ground

[2022-12-27 10:47:15] <Deus_Maximus> Okay. assuming it's in the same place for Streamlabs OBS as it is in regular OBS - maybe go to File > Settings > Output and make sure Encoder is set to NVENC?
[2022-12-27 10:47:37] <Deus_Maximus> It should already be on that, but just in case it isn't
[2022-12-27 10:48:09] <@+Bazzalis> Shai doesn't haven't have an issue in other games usually.

[2022-12-27 10:49:12] <Deus_Maximus> Well, if it was set to software, it'd be an issue in Star Citizen because SC uses the CPU more heavily.

[2022-12-27 10:52:05] <@^Nightbot> Check out evree11 at https://www.twitch.tv/evree11 They were last playing Star Citizen
[2022-12-27 10:52:16] <DariusGreyRugarBloodmoon> I found it easier to check out the youtube videos.  And we visit many, the food inventory is a bug, try inspecting the item to get it in hand.

[2022-12-27 10:59:32] <+TacticalMindset> It is for that reason, the upcoming wipe that I'm likely to wait until 3.18 goes live, before I buy into the game

[2022-12-27 11:26:39] <DariusGreyRugarBloodmoon> It is alot more stable for a alpha then some fully released games
[2022-12-27 11:26:49] <EnvyMiyu> Bugs are a part of life now, the best part is finding the bug before someone else does
[2022-12-27 11:26:50] <%gotmelk1890> Conan doesn't have bugs. it has unexpected features ;))
[2022-12-27 11:27:09] <DariusGreyRugarBloodmoon> the arm thing, the fix is to drop a helmet, and carry it, then equip.
[2022-12-27 11:27:24] <+Void_Tiger_> 3.18 performs much better, they just need to squash a few game-breaking bugs
[2022-12-27 11:27:35] <DariusGreyRugarBloodmoon> yes
[2022-12-27 11:27:41] <The1Fortress> Completely agree with the point you made with potential, game has absolutely massive scope and has the potential to be one of, if not the best space game out there
[2022-12-27 11:28:25] <DariusGreyRugarBloodmoon> and this is only the first system

[2022-12-27 11:28:55] <EnvyMiyu> You do die in No Man's Sky, I've lost many hardcore char while playing, mostly on moons

[2022-12-27 11:29:14] <Sidewaves> hi. why it's so bright?
[2022-12-27 11:29:38] <+Void_Tiger_> after a while, all the terminals, MFDs, and the flight UI disappear
[2022-12-27 11:29:38] <The1Fortress> Yep, its only the first system, and they havent even started to implement a range of different game mechanics

[2022-12-27 11:38:08] <The1Fortress> if you want to have a much easier time landing, when you're going to land, set your speed limiter to like 10-15% at most, takes a bit longer but is so much easier its worth it
[2022-12-27 11:38:28] <DariusGreyRugarBloodmoon> only fix is to wait til they unassign the pad, then call just once

[2022-12-27 11:51:07] <OldGamer001> only way to get to "optimize" is to play around with your gfx settings.  higher gfx settings taxes your gpu more, and can take the load of your cpu if that is what is taking the hit. . it's different for everyone.
[2022-12-27 11:51:52] <OldGamer001> kinda is "wasting" time playing live, when 3.18 is going live, there will be a complete wipe of live servers
[2022-12-27 11:51:57] <The1Fortress> thing that a lot of people dont realise about star citizen, they always complain that its been in development for ages, they dont realize that they people making the game havent used a premade engine to build it, they're making the whole game from the ground up

[2022-12-27 14:00:05] <+MasterAllan83> Where is the future I was PROMISED by movies?????  Why aren't women walking around in shiny spandex leotards and sheer pantyhose, with unnecessary rings and hoops or strange jewelry and headpieces?

[2022-12-27 14:02:14] <+MasterAllan83> The Future I was promised since the early Science Fiction movies, all through the 60s, 70s, 80s, 90s
[2022-12-27 14:02:51] <FuzzyTreat> well it is the future,so not now but "soon"
[2022-12-27 14:02:56] <+MasterAllan83> SPACE ODESSAY IS EPIC
[2022-12-27 14:03:13] <+MasterAllan83> ALIENS is still AWESOME
[2022-12-27 14:03:15] <%+Kathom67> HAL is beyond doubt

[2022-12-27 14:03:39] <+MasterAllan83> Yes I would, because I lived through the 1980s and we had to deal with Nuclear Annihilation Threats as well as in 2001
[2022-12-27 14:04:12] <+MasterAllan83> Fifth Element
[2022-12-27 14:04:16] <+Void_Tiger_> 5th Element?
[2022-12-27 14:04:43] <The1Fortress> I forget the movie name, but there's this one where there's hyper advanced technology and humanity has integrated it perfectly into nature, so the world is just this green leafy technology world
[2022-12-27 14:04:49] <%+Kathom67> Wall-E - having my own floating chair and exercising nothing more than my little toe. :D
[2022-12-27 14:05:04] <+MasterAllan83> Utopia is always dominated by Big Brother, where everyone is controlled, and their thoughts, feelings and emotions are Surpressed
[2022-12-27 14:05:08] <+Banakiwi> yeai, Wall-E....so cute :)
[2022-12-27 14:05:22] <+MasterAllan83> @shaiQuera What do they do with all the bodies, and how do they grow food in WALL-E?  think about it

[2022-12-27 14:05:37] <%+Kathom67> Before you. It is recealing that we both think of that movie. :D
[2022-12-27 14:05:42] <%+Kathom67> "revealing"
[2022-12-27 14:05:44] <+techhead12> my wife got me the special edition wall-e pop figure. he is like a foot tall lol
[2022-12-27 14:05:44] <+MasterAllan83> what IS the pink sludge they all consume in Wall=E
[2022-12-27 14:06:10] <+Void_Tiger_> soylent pink?
[2022-12-27 14:06:22] <EnvyMiyu> It's human
[2022-12-27 14:06:28] <+MasterAllan83> SOYLENT PINK IS PEOPLE!!!
[2022-12-27 14:06:31] <%+Kathom67> Syolent Green was the most sustainable food ever!
[2022-12-27 14:06:40] <+Void_Tiger_> ikr!

[2022-12-27 14:07:48] <%+Kathom67> The algae
[2022-12-27 14:08:03] <+Void_Tiger_> unless you're tlaking armore and weapons, then it's Centermass
[2022-12-27 14:08:04] <%+Kathom67> It is soy plus lentils, with algae. Supposedly...
[2022-12-27 14:08:25] <+Void_Tiger_> oi, I need to watch when I type...lol
[2022-12-27 14:08:35] <%+Kathom67> But actually I don't think I ever saw a movie future I would want to live in.
[2022-12-27 14:08:36] <+MasterAllan83> It STARTED as algae, but the ocean temperature rose rapidly and killed all the sea algae and sea life, so the only other "Meat" available was humans
[2022-12-27 14:09:14] <+Void_Tiger_> to sell armor and weapons, go to centermass, to sell prezzies go to MT PLanetary Services
[2022-12-27 14:09:29] <+MasterAllan83> Start Trek is pretty good of a Synarchy or Utopia, if you lived on Earth
[2022-12-27 14:09:32] VIEWERS: 83
[2022-12-27 14:09:52] <%+Kathom67> By most food regulations, humans would not pass as edible meat, with all the chemical and pharmaceutical residues in our tissue. :D
[2022-12-27 14:10:18] <+MasterAllan83> Lab Grown Meat is the FUTURE
[2022-12-27 14:10:52] <%+Kathom67> Logan's Run was a perfect future. If you were below the age of 30, that is.

[2022-12-27 14:11:34] <thecryptprophet> omg the best show
[2022-12-27 14:11:43] <The1Fortress> The 100 oof
[2022-12-27 14:11:44] <%+Kathom67> Never watched it
[2022-12-27 14:11:45] <+MasterAllan83> Veganism Vegetarianism is not suitable for sustaining a human body
[2022-12-27 14:11:59] <The1Fortress> Only watched like 3 seasons before I got tired of the repetitive writing
[2022-12-27 14:12:16] <+MasterAllan83> My mom watched it.  to me it felt too much like a Tween Show, like THE TRIBE.  Horrible drama for teens and young adults
[2022-12-27 14:12:24] <thecryptprophet> u send humans now to something like that they will go crazy  without cellphone
[2022-12-27 14:12:38] <+Void_Tiger_> liked The 100

[2022-12-27 14:13:50] <+Void_Tiger_> that's the one about the airplane passengers, right?
[2022-12-27 14:13:55] <The1Fortress> My favourite show is honestly Lucifer
[2022-12-27 14:14:09] <thecryptprophet> lol

[2022-12-27 14:16:49] <thecryptprophet> but really the best show its Buffy The Vampire Slayer

[2022-12-27 14:17:43] <%+Kathom67> As X-Files fan I tend to disagree. :D But Buffy was fun.
[2022-12-27 14:18:04] <thecryptprophet> @Kathom67 i could not get into X-files
[2022-12-27 14:18:19] <%+Kathom67> The truth is out there, @thecryptprophet !

[2022-12-27 14:22:00] <%+Kathom67> Would be fun if you could drink too much, cause some trouble and be arrested for the day in RL :D
[2022-12-27 14:22:31] <thecryptprophet> lolo
[2022-12-27 14:23:11] <+Banakiwi> sounds reasonable, yes ^^
[2022-12-27 14:23:15] <%+Kathom67> In RL hours I mean. Immersive gameplay. ^^
[2022-12-27 14:23:37] VIEWERS: 80
[2022-12-27 14:23:46] <The1Fortress> Witcher 3 or HZD
[2022-12-27 14:23:50] <The1Fortress> both are very very good
[2022-12-27 14:24:08] <%+Kathom67> Witcher III looks beautiful
[2022-12-27 14:24:23] <The1Fortress> Witcher 3 is my fav game of all time though I wont lie, of the two I'd pick that
[2022-12-27 14:24:25] <%+Kathom67> Okay, so does HZD ^^
