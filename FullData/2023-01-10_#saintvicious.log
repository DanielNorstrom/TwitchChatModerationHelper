[2023-01-10 05:37:47] <@%Adventureness> @fatguy925 this for sure. the 2nd season is supposed to be a lot better character wise
[2023-01-10 05:37:52] <Saahf> Vinland 2nd season is gonna be a weird one for people who liked the action PepeLaugh

[2023-01-10 05:38:30] <@%fatguy925> @Adventureness It gets into the meat of the manga, but the faster animation makes me feel cringy, but thats also because theres a bit more fan service i feel
[2023-01-10 05:38:52] <@%fatguy925> I like the small tohru manga drawing a bit more than the anime version AYAYA
