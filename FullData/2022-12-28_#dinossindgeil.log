[2022-12-28 15:22:33] <d0nnerheim> I'm from Hamburg and the only weather we have is rain
[2022-12-28 15:22:36] <@%+Lakerr_> mestar there are winter tires that aren't studded that do the job - that's what i have and i do pretty well. we have plow trucks that come through and salt/sand the roads that rid the majority if not all of the ice. we don't really have "icy" roads for more than 4-6 hours at worst typically. but bad storms just cant be kept up with

[2022-12-28 15:24:15] <@%+Lakerr_> mestar i'd say about 98% of the winter there's no ice on the roads and there's safe driving conditions without having studded tires, but for that 2% its either like 3am before the trucks come out or terrible storms and its more common sense to just be careful or don't drive KEKW
[2022-12-28 15:24:15] <Tardkovsky> it increases aow dmg

[2022-12-28 15:27:03] <@%+Lakerr_> to give some context of why studded tires would be bad here - we had -25.5c wind chill all last weekend and a little over 1m of snow, but tomorrow (less than a week later) we are expected to have 4c and rain for three days @meinMestar so its just going to be a wet mess KEKW

[2022-12-28 16:02:29] <!%TurtleArmyJess> laker says once you're whitelisted the mass reports are either filtered or there's a manual process to check for "cheating" behavior @dinossindgeil speculation here how that all works but MUCH bigger Warzone streamers must get reported hundreds if not thousands of times per day and they don't have these issues bc they are whitelisted by the publisher

[2022-12-28 18:44:35] <%thisChillGuy> And 2. phase can only be parried witt blasphemous blade
[2022-12-28 18:44:38] <%+cirillios> Uh oh. You already killed Bernahl
