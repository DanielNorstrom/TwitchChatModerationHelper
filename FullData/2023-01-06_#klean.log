[2023-01-06 00:01:50] <%MXIPOV> BSG really fucking showed their skill with the design of this map. They just need to take all the lighting and graphics from this map and coat all the other maps with it.

[2023-01-06 01:19:41] <%Torabisu420> @fortburke basically slow walk at crouch/standing is the same audio noise now, and that its extremely hard to try and be stealthy. they were thinking the comtacs are "op" sorta right now for picking up sound. but idk this my first wipe so i dont know how it differs.
[2023-01-06 01:20:01] <%wh1sper_44> Has Klean used the GL?

[2023-01-06 01:21:00] <+Klaro> @Torabisu420 same here with wipe. the only thing ive noticed is, that sometimes i cant say if the shots come from behind or infront...

[2023-01-06 01:40:05] <%$Deezil_Wood> I wish they would make it where you can see your scav stats out of raid.  Seems like it would be easy to implement, there's already a tab for it.
[2023-01-06 01:40:08] <de_charny> Honestly I dont think that there should be too many benefits for high scav karma. It is supposed to incentivize scav cooperation but it should still be an option to be a traitor scav. The potential loot gains need to be worth the hit in karma and negative effects: longer timer and lower loot

[2023-01-06 01:45:50] <+MindFlayerInc> @Satannogria What a false equivalencey lmao. Difficulty and nuance does not equal inconvinience or vice versa.
[2023-01-06 01:46:13] <IronThrone> does the vog-25 only work for the ak gl?

[2023-01-06 01:48:35] <+MindFlayerInc> @Satannogria Lmao, yeah, I get that brother. But making a game inconvinient and making it difficult are two different things. They aren't mutually exclusive, but they aren't the same.
[2023-01-06 01:48:46] <justicefortigerpanda> bro its so satisfying to shoot with the ads glitch you found holy this NEEDS to be an option

[2023-01-06 01:51:18] <+Andcef> @Klean I kinda think part of why early wipe rules is that a lot of the starting items and ammos up to mid tier are really well balanced against eachother. Late game items are really powercreepy.

[2023-01-06 01:55:22] <%+cykaq49> @Klean You know whats funny, its so easy getting good armor early wipe, and have it between raids, but getting ammo its not, I just hate how most ammo is useless in this game, I shouldn't have to shoot someone 15 times if i'm using 556, doesn't matter the kind of bullet or armor the guys is using
[2023-01-06 01:55:50] <%+BoyThatsMyMeat> Trying to grind out Stirrup knocked my survival rate down 30%

[2023-01-06 01:56:07] <bigblunt47> some quest are not the same early wipe or mid wipe kinda sux too
[2023-01-06 01:56:11] <+noobovskytv> I just got shot by 855 3 times with tier 4 armour on and died so
[2023-01-06 01:56:33] <SamileX> Survival rate means very little in this game, someone could sit in a bush til last 5 minutes to farm SR

[2023-01-06 05:05:33] <+Fadaar> tbh the mcx spear makes the scar more obselete than it already was
[2023-01-06 05:05:40] <%BlackInSanity> Games don't do it justice imo but I love the L85A2
[2023-01-06 05:05:40] <%DRMALIKIA> I want to get one of those machined AK receivers from Meridian Defense.  I am however not going to wait over a year.

[2023-01-06 19:48:57] <%+GL0CKenspeil> @secondthefirst that many headshots is a little sus tho
[2023-01-06 19:49:00] <Truck_OG> @Klean when you ads it looks diffrent, that a bug ?
[2023-01-06 19:49:04] <%obedezuu> Ah yes standard acc dude on flee market with 100 rep efter 7 days selling 50 gpus, not sus Kapp
[2023-01-06 19:49:18] <%Borlng> Nah wouldn't be a stream sniper. Odds of that gotta be like 1%<
[2023-01-06 19:49:23] <ddpbr> you are gonna need people working full time to monitor all that shit
[2023-01-06 19:49:27] <ItsPixelWolf> I agree
[2023-01-06 19:49:29] <%+RatPhd> @kevsabot Don't cross your fingers, haha. That is a pretty complex feature to implement, and a lot of data to collect
[2023-01-06 19:49:30] <Secondthefirst> @GL0CKenspeil honestly i could imagine both stream snipe and hacks
[2023-01-06 19:49:35] <jakeluiz> @Truck_OG Dude, klean has a video on his YT about it.  Changes things for you big time.  Feels so much more natural
[2023-01-06 19:49:41] <%+lookingforslatt> I feel like bsg themselves makes cheats on the side to make more money
[2023-01-06 19:49:45] <+BAMTHEBA57ARD> loads selling cheats on tiktok
[2023-01-06 19:49:50] <+DapperFox__> Manual review might actually work for Tarkov since there's few enough people
[2023-01-06 19:49:50] <%+PVKNIGHTS> They also target streamers which makes the want to play this even worse when people see it
[2023-01-06 19:49:52] <+ThaWormiest> How many false bans?
[2023-01-06 19:49:54] <Truck_OG> @jakeluiz oh thx man
[2023-01-06 19:49:56] <donniestingray> I would imagine you have a louder voice in connection to BSG so having a cheater shown on twitch would make it more of a priority and who knows what info BSG get from checking that account @Klean
[2023-01-06 19:50:12] <OGMcGriddles> do you think what you just experienced would justify a ban
[2023-01-06 19:50:17] <Marcus_Helius> I refuse to play a game that has these kind of cheats
[2023-01-06 19:50:17] <%+GL0CKenspeil> Is the bigger issue that they buy new accounts or that they don’t get banned in the first place?
[2023-01-06 19:50:22] <TigerActual> Could do similar to how CS:GO does demos and whatnot.
[2023-01-06 19:50:22] <bri4nski> very curious what their baseline is. Seems very tolerant to say the least
[2023-01-06 19:50:37] VIEWERS: 1 622
[2023-01-06 19:50:44] <jakeluiz> @Truck_OG But yeah, it's a bug.  Kinda cool until it's fixed.  But after using it a bit, It'd be nice if BSG made it a permanent option
[2023-01-06 19:50:47] <%+kevsabot> @kevsabot yeah i agree its very complex but if they could implement a system like what csgo does there would be so many cheaters banned. Fix audio first tho :P
[2023-01-06 19:50:50] <donniestingray> @GL0CKenspeil I'm all for them buying more accounts. its getting BSG paid to keep working. I just wish they banned them faster

[Know you talked before about wanting a low ready / high ready system in Tarkov, not sure if you've played the Road to Vostock demo yet but they have something like that where having the gun up at high ready drains some arm stamina and you cant shoot from the low]
[2023-01-06 19:50:55] <%obedezuu> Back when EFT only had their inhouse anti-cheat "Saber" and it wasn't even running for a while..
[2023-01-06 19:51:02] <%+GWoo42> i stopped playing last wipe because of how often i was killed by cheaters and i really hope they do something soon because i dont want this wipe to be like the last
[2023-01-06 19:51:07] <Raava25> so if you are good enough you can ban from eft KEKW
[2023-01-06 19:51:14] <+RocMEME> KLEAN I LOVE YOU!!!!!
[2023-01-06 19:51:32] <z_o_m_33> well sometimes i random shoot bushes and 1 out of 50 times i hit someone xdd thats 100% a report on me ahahha
[2023-01-06 19:51:34] <+DapperFox__> I love Shoreline though LUL
[2023-01-06 19:51:36] <%+RatPhd> @kevsabot Totally agree. It would just need to be VERY precise or it would lead to false positives like other games where they add replays and the replays are not at all a depiction of what actually happened
[2023-01-06 19:51:45] <%JinxorD3> i wish they could make a system where if they are tagged as a cheater their bullets do no damage
[2023-01-06 19:51:52] <bri4nski> @Raava25 i think that already happened a few times
[2023-01-06 19:52:17] <%Dev_24> when you press tab your sight stays off center, you gotta center it before
[2023-01-06 19:52:30] <TigerActual> @JinxorD3 Or when they shoot someone, the damage that would be done is applied to the shooter.

[2023-01-06 20:05:34] <@%SpottedTango> @Sycuown Tarkov needs good ram, processor, and it frequents memory leaks so frequent restarts and settings tuning is a good idea. Turn off binaural audio, LOD on low. 16 gigs of decent RAM minimum. 32GB recommended. 5600X 8600K min 5800X 8700K recommended.

[2023-01-06 20:15:03] <@%SpottedTango> @Sycuown that sounds about right honestly, maybe 10 fps off what I'd expect. Check your cooling/OC. You'll need to dial in a good OC on the 7700K to keep up with tarkov. It is super CPU heavy. I think as long as you're reaching high 4.xGhz you should be good.

[2023-01-06 20:17:53] <ukly0> @cubezgg idk how much different those 2 cpu are so i was just saying just in case
[2023-01-06 20:17:56] <+Sycuown> @dudd_ ima have ot look at what dldsr is
[2023-01-06 20:17:56] <%RichyLovy> @Emperor_Ad3ptus Diabetes
[2023-01-06 20:17:57] <dudd_> and my ram sucks ass, I have 16gb 2666hz
[2023-01-06 20:18:03] <%+Bows0108> so I have to pay 20 dollars for the DTS headphones X and enable Microsoft spatial audio for the sound to be better?
[2023-01-06 20:18:08] <ExecutiveMilk> Watcha drinkin?
[2023-01-06 20:18:09] <+SparklingLlama> thank goodness i got my 5800X before i got my 3080TI
[2023-01-06 20:18:11] <J_Bird77> the build I want gonna cost me almost 6k...my wifey isn't too happy so I guess I'll buy her a chanel purse lol
[2023-01-06 20:18:22] <@%SpottedTango> another thing. I found going watercooled was a great change specifically for Tarkov. Simply because it keeps my max boost on my ryzen CPU at it's highest. a high-airflow case with an overkill aircooler would do the same, but keeping both my CPU and GPU well under their downclock temp targets means my frame consistency is amazing. No sharp dips until the engine starts falling apart 6-7 raids in.
[2023-01-06 20:18:25] <%+Emperor_Ad3ptus> @Emperor_Ad3ptus like what drink flavor tho? put me on.
[2023-01-06 20:18:28] <@%+cubezgg> @cubezgg they're 2 generations apart and OC'd to 4.8 is pretty great silicon lottery
[2023-01-06 20:18:29] <%KrackinWise313> @dudd_ Yeah 32 comes in clutch
[2023-01-06 20:18:33] <dudd_> @sycuown its just upscaling, it's not gonna make your game run better, just gonna look better

[2023-01-06 20:21:08] <+Sycuown> @NaoumTV i wonder if they will eve get it down to seconds like other games, afterall this game has no mmr i think
[2023-01-06 20:21:11] <@%+cubezgg> @J_Bird77 sounds like you're absolutely overpaying
[2023-01-06 20:21:48] <%+chronicman> 6k seems extremely over priced
[2023-01-06 20:22:01] <J_Bird77> definitely overpaying since I'm not building it
[2023-01-06 20:22:03] <%+chronicman> should be able to go top tier for 4k
[2023-01-06 20:22:11] <+A_Vulgar_Display> 6k for a pc? i hope your getting a bj with that ...or at least a pair of socks filled with warm vaseline
[2023-01-06 20:22:19] <J_Bird77> I could build it for 4500
[2023-01-06 20:22:20] <@%+cubezgg> even for a pre build 6k is way too much
[2023-01-06 20:22:32] <dudd_> @j_bird77 you can buy your parts and pay someone to build the pc
[2023-01-06 20:22:40] <%+chronicman> you shouldn't be paying them 1500 to build it for you brother
[2023-01-06 20:22:42] <montigomo1981> I wish the maps were not so linear and had more freedom of movement where you can go everywhere, climb on fences, etc.

[2023-01-06 20:23:02] <+Battalius> 4500 for a prebuild is still overpriced lmao
[2023-01-06 20:23:11] <@%+cubezgg> @Battalius depends what partsd
[2023-01-06 20:23:18] <KrayZJool> if you're not overpaying for computer hardware you're living in the past!. 10k minimum in 2023, for the clout danEasy
[2023-01-06 20:23:19] <%+chronicman> most pre-built companies are doing 400-500 for them to build it and they come with warranties
[2023-01-06 20:23:25] <+teesk1> and especially for like what are you playing? tarkov isn't worth a 6k pc lmao

[2023-01-06 21:07:37] <!%lLMrBrightside> 16gb is barely good for any modern games
[2023-01-06 21:07:40] <+Fustuv> I dont know why they did the change of forcing players with fine rigs to wait on other players with shitty rigs, back in old tarkov if you had a crap PC you would load in late to the raid while people with decent PCs loaded in first, IT made queue times less than a minute no joke and raids flowed nice, now its all a mess
[2023-01-06 21:07:40] <+MetalMilitia74> @Barrettaa 64gb is not enough with all the memory leaks lol

[2023-01-06 21:42:02] <p_jilla> it really dis incintivises me when i see streamers and stuff already lvl 37 like a week into the wipe. feel like wipe is already over and im lvl 10
[2023-01-06 21:42:56] <codymasin> @p_jilla bro they play 12 hours a day and have been playing g for years. It’s a small percentage of the total player base. don’t sweat it.
[2023-01-06 21:43:00] <+mylanknowsbest> Ya idk what they did but the audio sounds worse than before bi audio came out lol
[2023-01-06 21:43:06] <%Suspicious_Potatoes> @p_jilla It's probably like 5-10% of players at most that grind that far this early
[2023-01-06 21:43:46] <%+Flookiee> @p_jilla the chances of you running into a player this high level right now are very low.

[2023-01-06 21:45:26] <%+Bows0108> also this game has become like a religion to some so if they are high level it usually means they know the most efficient things to focus on
[2023-01-06 21:45:43] <%+Bows0108> most people dont even realize to focus on questing to level at first
[2023-01-06 21:45:47] <%+Flookiee> @mylanknowsbest nah what im saying is, its placebo. bi audio isnt working. just turn it off for now. All its doing is taking fps. checkout Veritas video on youtube that proves it

[2023-01-06 21:47:49] <EntropyB> @p_jilla There is zero reason to be disappointed. I think you need to just not compare yourself to others, especially the people who are literally some of the best at the game
[2023-01-06 21:47:53] <iTexanWaffle> not sitting in bushes until 10 minutes left i have just gotten a little more confident with my abilities

[2023-01-06 21:48:59] <+abstract_jesus> ^same lol. Been using bolties + pistol more too. Very satisfying when you make it work
[2023-01-06 21:49:07] <%Suspicious_Potatoes> getting comfortable with the game is honestly the biggest obstacle to playing well
[2023-01-06 21:49:14] <iTexanWaffle> @Rorviticus yes and i realized using gear helped me survive more
[2023-01-06 21:49:25] <p_jilla> @EntropyB its not so much about me feeling like i dont compare so much as seeing people that high already makes me feel under equipped to go into a raid to handle them and just that the wipe is already over.
[2023-01-06 21:49:39] <%darcss> @Klean did u watch the results video for the audio test ?
[2023-01-06 21:49:44] <%+zaccray> Playing solo this wipe has made it much more enjoyable this time around

[2023-01-06 21:50:24] <%Suspicious_Potatoes> for now anyway
[2023-01-06 21:50:29] <EntropyB> @p_jilla best thing about this game is even players with the best gear can still be one tapped, and can do nothing about it. Don't worry about level so much, a lot of times it doesn't mean anything. Crap players can be high level too

[2023-01-06 22:10:28] <+ChaceFX> Tarkov isn't really GPU heavy. I have a 1080ti my bud has a 3080ti an gets like 5 to 7 more fps than me.  Tarkov is all bout cpu and ram.
[2023-01-06 22:10:34] <neuroni84> I played Tarkov on a 1050Ti back in the day. fps was playable but detail had to be pretty blurry. still enjoyable.
[2023-01-06 22:10:38] <+DamnItTimmy1> I have a 12700k and 3080ti the map optimisation is so wack

[2023-01-06 22:10:49] <%Dilan434> @RaijinTDM Tarkov eats ram so might be the problem
[2023-01-06 22:10:51] <InnererKonflikt> performance is also server and client/serverside dependant. and map dependant. also 32gb ram or go home on some maps. same for vram on high textures.
[2023-01-06 22:11:11] <+xsolarityx> i might have to upgrade my ram. Im running 16gb
[2023-01-06 22:11:13] <+DamnItTimmy1> 64gb DDR5 5600
[2023-01-06 22:11:13] <%+RaijinTDM> @Dilan434 running 64gb ddr4 lol
[2023-01-06 22:11:15] <%BSDilly> 32gb, with new gen games if you arent on 32 its a sold deal your just gonna have shitter performance
[2023-01-06 22:11:16] <%Dilan434> Streets makes me use 13GB of ram
[2023-01-06 22:11:40] <+xsolarityx> @Dilan434 i think thats the problem for me then. Im using 16gb ram so idk. I get shit frames

[2023-01-06 22:13:47] <InnererKonflikt> strong CPU (10900k or newer) + 32GB of RAM with 3200mhz to 400mhz ddr4 or ddr5 (8GB of VRAM for high textures minimum for bigger maps, but better if 10 to 12gb), rest is connection reliant. and of course sata ssd or nvme. no HDD. the basic guide to tarkov performance.
[2023-01-06 22:13:53] <higbo> literally doesnt fit, right?

[2023-01-06 22:22:17] <TokkyoZ> @SaltyCierra and the malus ? Recoil etc
[2023-01-06 22:22:20] <%ekozaur> @InnererKonflikt Correct, I keep seeing Klean rubber band around and I kinda understand it. They (BSG) have a huge influx of players right now, due to new map, drops and the holidays (people are at home, off work). At this point, what should they do? Invest and ramp up server allocation which costs them money or just let the players get a lil' bit frustrated and once the update settles, everything will be fine (as it used to)

[2023-01-06 22:24:30] <%+kevsabot> yeah i get mad FOMO if i miss the first few days of the wipe
[2023-01-06 22:24:44] <+maveric80> @Klean how do the gun stats work? Is it the higher the number is better or is it the lower the number is better?
[2023-01-06 22:25:05] <%+Rorviticus> @maveric80 whats stats specifically?
[2023-01-06 22:25:05] <%+TheDocBowman> sounded like you said homo lol
[2023-01-06 22:25:05] <%+RaijinTDM> i just had a raid on customs where i was completely unable to shoot. found an RSASS in an airdrop and literally had to run and dodge scavs to get out old gas lmao but i survived
[2023-01-06 22:25:10] <%+AttemptedPants> It wouldn’t be so bad if it wasn’t a mad sprint to the best gear lytWIPED
[2023-01-06 22:25:10] <+monkeytrumpetz1> @maveric80 high recoil bad, high ergo good
[2023-01-06 22:25:10] <+Silvia240> i wait to play on purpose, that way stuff gets cheaper and tasks are easier lol
[2023-01-06 22:25:18] <+kehfka> high ergonomics is what you want , lower the recoil the better
[2023-01-06 22:25:24] <+xsolarityx> interchange is FUBAR
[2023-01-06 22:25:24] <+angrychauncey> it makes sense though. if you start too late you won't even win a gunfight because you dont have the ammo
[2023-01-06 22:25:25] <+Sintheticxtac> good look on that FOV glitch my guy
[2023-01-06 22:25:25] <%ekozaur> I can't play games with battle pass  because of fomo :( I'm down bad, and if it's a few days and it ends, I'll just pay up to get all rewards
[2023-01-06 22:25:31] <ste3zydeezy> im lvl 16 and i kinda get FOMO for not grinding every single day, but i'm afraid of getting burnt out

[2023-01-06 23:48:55] <InnererKonflikt> @rainsomemore VRAM / RAM Usage. if it you wanna know how to check your PC´s basic info and evaluate if somethings wrong, you can always check out youtbe guides on how to use msi afterburners rivatune statistics erver, RTSS for short. if ram is too full, windows will put stuff from RAM into the pagefile which is real bad for performance. and if VRAm allocation is too tight and it starts texturestreaming directly from the SSD, also bad. your vram should be fine with a 3070 though
