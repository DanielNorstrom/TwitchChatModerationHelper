[2022-12-16 10:10:45] <@%PrinceBacon> Look at us Skåningar completing this task Donnis!
[2022-12-16 10:10:50] <spirosmakri> what does girdle mean?
[2022-12-16 10:11:10] <%$HinkenGaming> ask donnis about the Rasmus måste mjölka
[2022-12-16 10:11:14] <Eagorath> girdle means basically "belt"
[2022-12-16 10:11:14] <!d0nztAh> wiki wiki
[2022-12-16 10:11:30] <ble_ble> who is pelvis?
[2022-12-16 10:11:37] <TheAtlas3> A McDraven?
[2022-12-16 10:11:39] <!d0nztAh> gotta milk it, gotta feed the cows gotta milk it
[2022-12-16 10:12:52] <@%PrinceBacon> The pelvis girdle is like a ring of bones at the very bottom of the spine. It kinda has to shift a bit so babeh comes out, so lots of weird hormones make stuff more mobile and it can cause pain.

[2022-12-16 10:25:10] <spirosmakri> @princebacon it's okay, I just felt sorry about all the women that go through this and many more while pregante

[2022-12-16 10:25:29] <%mirage_du> @acbareac Sounds good. We were both at the doctor after a year as well. Then my wife got the pills for a few month and as soon as the value was at the desired spot, boom pregnant.

[2022-12-16 10:26:45] <%mirage_du> @acbareac I would also advise not to do many tests unless the bleedings of your girl is missing. Just makes to much stress to look at those tests constantly
