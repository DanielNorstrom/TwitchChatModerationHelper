[2022-12-30 22:35:07] <samiam1616> With DF the question is really what inevitably kills your fortress, and sometimes that answer is "boredom + stupid trick"
[2022-12-30 22:35:11] <Some_Kitty_Cat> @Limealicious you could also retire the fort and make a new one, then later when adventure mode gets added you will be able to visit it to see how the dwarves handled themselves since you left

[2022-12-30 23:35:14] <SateasAnages> is this game more complex than RimWorld or are they on a similar level?
[2022-12-30 23:35:21] <%+Kippeves> it's the logic, not the graphcis
[2022-12-30 23:35:24] <%$peekas0> There was probably not much pathfinding going on.

[2022-12-30 23:36:15] <Leud_De_Grace> Yeah, also story generator feels like weird term for rimworld from what Ive heard
[2022-12-30 23:36:17] <@%Greygull> Dwarf Fortress takes a while to get to the FUN :)
[2022-12-30 23:36:17] <%LewdShroom> Thanks Laimubot LUL
[2022-12-30 23:36:18] <b0Stark> Tbh, DF doesn't need RW's level of throwing death at you. DF makes sure you bring your own death to you. LUL
[2022-12-30 23:36:23] <+BottleGnomes> DF difficulty changes a lot with different embark locations
[2022-12-30 23:36:26] <@%+Joe> can u manage deez nuts
[2022-12-30 23:36:26] <Chessrook44> I saw you picked this up not long ago, and I keep seeing you stream it lately.  CLearly, you've been enjoying it a lot.
[2022-12-30 23:36:29] <Bortonium> your Dwarves seem more likely to kill themselves in some stupid way than the colonists
[2022-12-30 23:36:31] <ThisRedKind> It's an ant farm with dwarves instead
[2022-12-30 23:36:33] <samiam1616> in Rimworld you manage individuals and there's a sense that the game is throwing stuff at you to eventually kill you. In DF you're just a big cog in the world and things happen

[2022-12-30 23:38:02] <%FourtyTwo424242> @PUPHEAD in theory you can keep playing forever, only time you die is when something pops up and wipes you out.
[2022-12-30 23:38:03] <%$distractedcamel> There's some craziness you can do with the settings yeah
[2022-12-30 23:38:03] <@%Greygull> on world generation there's harder enemy difficulty + economy difficulty you can choose
[2022-12-30 23:38:05] <Skython> dorf
[2022-12-30 23:38:06] <streamChef> It has the savage/beasts settings when you generate the world
[2022-12-30 23:38:06] <b0Stark> DF is its own difficulty level.
[2022-12-30 23:38:14] <Chessrook44> I'd say difficulty depends on the situation you go with.
[2022-12-30 23:38:15] <%TsunamiAromatic> you can change population triggers
[2022-12-30 23:38:23] <%JeffOverTime> You can start your fort nearer to danger limesEvil
[2022-12-30 23:38:24] <Chessrook44> Embark on a Haunted Glacier sometime.  It'll get ROUGH.
[2022-12-30 23:38:27] <%Xifihas> Kind of, you can make things harder by settling in a hostile environment or taking less useful dorfs.
[2022-12-30 23:38:38] <%+Kippeves> The hardest difficulty is reached by setting the bird-squawking to "All the time"
[2022-12-30 23:38:44] <%FourtyTwo424242> Game can be super easy, it can be super hard, it matters one real life luck stat
[2022-12-30 23:38:45] <b0Stark> Find some elves, start a war. LUL
[2022-12-30 23:38:50] <@%Greygull> settle directly next to goblin pits for extra fun
