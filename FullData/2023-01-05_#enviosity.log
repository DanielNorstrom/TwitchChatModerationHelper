[2023-01-05 18:06:22] <+irregularkhun> obviously u r gonna get burned out if u have replayed the same thing 4-5 times KEKW
[2023-01-05 18:06:26] <%+t50_thelegend> @Enviosity the challenge for the new account is that he can only use characters that came out 2023 and after. I think that challenge is what hes plannin on making it fresh
[2023-01-05 18:06:26] <biscmoon> I play the game every day and I just finished grinding sumeru's forest area
[2023-01-05 18:06:28] <ffishfood> @Cypher1582 that takes a lot of time wow
[2023-01-05 18:06:28] <%+Luckell> he is going to quit in a week again for another I quit video LUL
[2023-01-05 18:06:31] <angelm923> @Enviosity Sumeru challenges are the worst

[2023-01-05 18:06:39] <%High_Village> only for primogem rewards ye
[2023-01-05 18:06:39] <Eiswuerfel22> @enviosity multi accounts is bad for the memory, getting achievements on new lucky accounts and thinking u got them on your main
[2023-01-05 18:06:41] <5_pain_6> like building the ultimate geo team .
[2023-01-05 18:06:43] <ffishfood> @Regera_DHC you didn't miss it !!!
[2023-01-05 18:06:46] <alhaithams_backabs> he said he cleared abyss with 2 characters and won't do anything else which is not fun
[2023-01-05 18:06:50] <vanemi428> I guess restarting the game makes you appreciate the small things that got you into the game in the first place + pacing down from the woes of being ar45 + when its so grindy and resource hungry

[2023-01-05 18:07:00] <%shatteredreamzz> why would you need a new account for that?
[2023-01-05 18:07:01] <Masteral4> I think he needs to switch game. it is Normal to get bored after 2 yrs
[2023-01-05 18:07:07] <lilWrld9999> @MaHoDeMe mtashed
[2023-01-05 18:07:08] <pseudosity> couldn't you do a similar challenge on his main account? why a new one

[2023-01-05 18:07:20] <singuista> Mtash wants this game to be something that its not. Thats the issue, and he doesn't know what to do about it
[2023-01-05 18:07:20] <Regera_DHC> ah thank you. I'll just sit and watch the show then <3
[2023-01-05 18:07:21] <+zenstarrii> He said he enjoys having a new goal

[2023-01-05 18:07:31] <acrux_n> He can do that on the same account tho, why Hmmge
[2023-01-05 18:07:31] <Wilex__> If only the game provided more for every scope it provided
[2023-01-05 18:07:31] <itsaMochi> Its just a vicious cycle. He loves Genshin so much he doesnt want to stop playing it, but then also wants to stop playing it because its not what he fully wants the game to be @Enviosity
[2023-01-05 18:07:31] <jullwild> true
[2023-01-05 18:07:31] <%empirewhite> but it still good content no?
[2023-01-05 18:07:31] <%enviswifi> SadChamp
[2023-01-05 18:07:32] <duckyyyyyyyyy_> My alt is mostly for playing with friends on NA but im completely f2p on it
[2023-01-05 18:07:41] <LordParedes> Isnt everyone just doing the base to get all rewards and then stop?Like, some events are fun to play, but some you just rush for rewards. totally understand and don't see what's the problem
[2023-01-05 18:07:46] <ucannvrwinn> Tbf you could do that challenge on your main account
[2023-01-05 18:07:48] <+mowlagaga> mtash is like a business man I feel like he only doing it for the views and money. since he does have a family to take care of.
[2023-01-05 18:07:52] <singuista> I mean this game has been an emotional roller coster for him since day 1
[2023-01-05 18:07:53] <peeka_booh> i got 2 accounts and ended up sticking to my first account as my main, 2 accounts are just wasting time
[2023-01-05 18:07:54] <%shatteredreamzz> I‚Äôm with you on this, i would never create another account
[2023-01-05 18:07:55] <Regera_DHC> Why am I hearing boss music
[2023-01-05 18:07:57] <Kage_The_Shadow> hes gonna get burnt out again Aware
[2023-01-05 18:07:57] <+irregularkhun> for me its as simple as i want to get all character eventually. also i want a 250 cv keqing plsKeqing
[2023-01-05 18:07:59] <DireZenith> I play like 15 min every day, just daily and resin
[2023-01-05 18:07:59] <%shatteredreamzz> he‚Äôs going to

[2023-01-05 18:08:09] <downbad4269> He will no doubt
[2023-01-05 18:08:12] <%katdawg_> he seems like hes been enjoying it so far
[2023-01-05 18:08:12] <+gagavoodoo> one thing that keeps me going is raising characters
[2023-01-05 18:08:14] <DarK_SDW> you are a twitch streamer we are average players. we are not the same
[2023-01-05 18:08:18] <highdozenofcopium> Play EU acc then Kappa
[2023-01-05 18:08:20] <+zenstarrii> Having 2 accs is ok but more than that‚Ä¶ nah
[2023-01-05 18:08:23] <%remaori> @itsaMochi no the problem is that there's no other game ppl are invested in that will keep his views consistent, this community is ONLY supportive of genshin content and no other game
[2023-01-05 18:08:29] <deusizuru> I am barely able to keep up with only one account KEKW
[2023-01-05 18:08:29] <%$SnakeTGK> @oyasumiprunprun he just did

[2023-01-05 18:08:31] <+Stylin502> How is he going to build new characters on a new account? He‚Äôll be region locked for a while @enviosity
[2023-01-05 18:08:32] <lilWrld9999> i have 3 alts lol
[2023-01-05 18:08:35] <+kojimbode> then again i'd rather play other games
[2023-01-05 18:08:35] <Magatsu_King> I just like building my characters to a usable spot
[2023-01-05 18:08:35] <%$hunter_crow13> george EZ win
[2023-01-05 18:08:35] <rinzdoodlez> @itsaMochi if he wants it to be an mmorpga with endless things to do around, genshin will never be. it is and will always be a single-player rpg
[2023-01-05 18:08:37] <%High_Village> i really think he would be happier if he just would move on, but its hard after doing content for it for 2 years and your channel build on it
[2023-01-05 18:08:37] <jaeees_> my alt account is only to pull for characters that I won't get on my main account
[2023-01-05 18:08:38] <%shatteredreamzz> there‚Äôs no shame, but the reasons behind making another doesn‚Äôt add up logically

[2023-01-05 18:08:54] <Jud4i> the other issue is that content creators are making so much from genshin.... but when the games switch the viewers leave

[2023-01-05 18:09:03] <firehawkplus> BabyRage  CC has to play this game my way- this chat HahaLean
[2023-01-05 18:09:04] <LordParedes> + also dont see the problem of having multiple accounts, even more if you're a free to play and really like the game. That way you test more chars without having to wait to get them in a rerun
[2023-01-05 18:09:06] <+irregularkhun> 250 cv keqing surely is a short term goal Clueless
[2023-01-05 18:09:07] <deusizuru> what's your long goal ?
[2023-01-05 18:09:08] <quintuple_purpose> I mean the thing is he could just play another game cause why are you playing Genshin if you're burnt out of Genshin basically just "stop it dude" KEKW

[2023-01-05 18:09:21] <%remaori> @High_Village exactly, chat can't seem to understand the genshin frogs will NOT be supportive of anything outside of genshin
[2023-01-05 18:09:21] <5_pain_6> my long term is : i see 160 i pull
[2023-01-05 18:09:21] <itsaMochi> @remaori I think that also comes with it though, but he has already said that he wants Genshin to be so much more than it already is. Instead of short mini games events he wants events to do that permanently stay in the game to make it harder etc

[2023-01-05 18:11:30] <paramesh10> @Enviosity Imagine an abyss mode where you get to replay all the previous floor 12 abyss floors that. i would love to replay 1.0 abyss with new chars
[2023-01-05 18:11:30] <+irregularkhun> i hope they expand on coop on this game, one day COPIUM
[2023-01-05 18:11:33] <%shatteredreamzz> infinite resin would not help people play more in the long run
[2023-01-05 18:11:40] <itsaMochi> The only wish I have for genshin is more domains and some form of domain co-op. But I dont think that will happen
[2023-01-05 18:11:43] <rosemon5001> playing whit others is too cringe

[2023-01-05 18:12:07] <Silshadnic> My goal as an F2P is to lvl up all my existing characters. Give them all their best 4pc sets (whatever stats) so that I don't have to swap artifacts and weapons. And max level one of each weapon from 1-5star
[2023-01-05 18:12:07] <pagan_1> i play genshin with ur stream in the background so i dont get bored

[2023-01-05 18:12:36] <+irregularkhun> @shatteredreamzz infinite resin would involve changing the rates on everything. say 20 resin gives u one gold artifact, w unlimited resin u would probably need to do like 10+ runs for one gold artifact

[2023-01-05 18:12:39] <mohammad1994mousavian> i do all domains and weekly bosses coop cause it's more fun even though i can do them alone in 5 minutes
[2023-01-05 18:12:40] <%remaori> @alhaithams_backabs because genshin was during a lockdown when ppl had NOTHING to do
[2023-01-05 18:12:41] <amor_rain> im in med school and i hate it and genshin is like one of my only ways for me to mentally escape for a bit, even if it gets boring sometimes its till helps me a lot

[2023-01-05 18:25:50] <+irregularkhun> @Enviosity while i agree w namecards, i dont see wheres the harm in having the base reward of primos for everyone while also having say 30 primos for the hard content. cause the reality is f2p that actually invests into their teams can also clear the hard stuff so its not a whale only thing and it could incentivize actually attempting to clear the hard stuff. cause as it stands theres literally no reason to clear the hard stages and theres prob ppl that wont care for cosmetic stuff

[2023-01-05 18:33:43] <%Valedrian> The thing with rewards is also centered around the overall contet of the game. Rewards might not please everyone but its more than enough to clear Abyss. At that point people just want rewards for the sake of big number or more gacha rolls
[2023-01-05 18:33:44] <rosemon5001> They need to up the xp reward item amounts if not from events atleast the ley lines because even a condensed gets abyssmal rewards

[2023-01-05 18:40:28] <zhongli127> Blackcliff for diluc good?
[2023-01-05 18:40:29] <%Valedrian> ranking would always be for super whales anyway. Artifacts have a limit of strenght
[2023-01-05 18:40:30] <%crvmble_> I got so many teams to play with. im ok if we have more than 3 chambers.
[2023-01-05 18:40:37] <ImaAuthorP> It‚Äôs alright, I‚Äôm at 57 and I haven‚Äôt 36 star either
[2023-01-05 18:40:38] <%roninmustdie> @worldpeace556 no worries, u will get there. current abyss is hard and requires specific comps and characters to get through
[2023-01-05 18:40:38] <dominustempus> Envi still struggles in the abyss so you're good
[2023-01-05 18:40:38] <quintuple_purpose> @taktNo5 Wouldn't people just post about it anyways?
[2023-01-05 18:40:40] <BbSteppes> @superluboss finished majority with yoiyaka. But for tavern challenges with tanky opponents, diluc mona pyro agent with many food cards. you need adeptus for bursts  kenki fischl and keqing is a 3 turn deck for me usually
[2023-01-05 18:40:40] <ucannvrwinn> @worldpeace556 nah,  but if 36 stars Is what you want then focus on resources mgt
[2023-01-05 18:40:40] <XrossMark> so tldr we get the same amount of primos in a month from abyss with less grind. wise decision by the devs

[2023-01-05 18:41:08] <kazumikeiko> hello envi!!
[2023-01-05 18:41:08] <arctickeis> that might make me more stressed out tbh
[2023-01-05 18:41:08] <oyasumiprunprun> that's kinda cool
[2023-01-05 18:41:11] <acrux_n> @worldpeace556 Old AR55 people farmed more, your AR is increased a lot by new quest, so don't worry.
[2023-01-05 18:41:11] <zeroumochi> Bro I'm almost AR 57 with 27 stars max, and I don't give a flying fuck if I can 36 star or not. It's obviously a goal but not a priority for me
[2023-01-05 18:41:12] <+gagavoodoo> oh kinda like overwatch
[2023-01-05 18:41:14] <F1T13> 36 staring ain't nothing crazy. You can just work up to it overtime if you wanna do it.
[2023-01-05 18:41:18] <quintuple_purpose> People would find out about it probably since people do love to brag
[2023-01-05 18:41:18] <Silshadnic> @worldpeace556 Nope. I'm F2P, AR59 almost 60 in a month or two. And only during 3.0 I finally was able to 36 star it. Before dendro I couldn't even 2 stars on each chamber of floor 12. So nah, you're good
[2023-01-05 18:41:19] <Esquivalience_> that removes the casual aspect of genshin tho
[2023-01-05 18:41:19] <worldpeace556> @5_pain_6 All my investment went into Noelle lol. C0 with Bolide and R4 Whiteblind

[2023-01-05 19:09:53] <Regera_DHC> I remember people initially used to write to support about Aloy constellations (myself included) and support usually gave the half assed "The time for this character bla bla bla night sky to light up". Now they'll just say "Pay attention to our newsletter for latest news about our characters you like", and then last time I sent it they responded with "No further information on this character".

[2023-01-05 22:43:30] <%shoe_meow> and i think when you collect a certain amount, your next ult is bigger and knocks up and stuff
[2023-01-05 22:43:53] <%shoe_meow> seems like its ur next ult then you gotta collect again for the ult to do that again
