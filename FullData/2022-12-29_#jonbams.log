There's a difference between debt collateralize by an appreciating asset i.e. house vs. a depreciating asset i.e. a car.  But it isn't a good sound bite for him.  It's easier to say "PAY OFF ALL DEBT" than "THERE'S NUANCE TO DEBT AND YOU SHOULD MANAGER YOURS ACCORDINGLY"

[2022-12-29 17:59:49] <%Puddingitinyou> Remnant is kind of souls like but with guns and a fair amount easier. It randomly generates every campaign, so you can reset and play again and get different maps and bosses and loot. Your choices sometimes get you different items depending on who you give something to or how you kill the boss. @JonBams Remnant, I mean.

[2022-12-29 18:00:33] <%Puddingitinyou> Remnant is kind of souls like but with guns and a fair amount easier. It randomly generates every campaign, so you can reset and play again and get different maps and bosses and loot. Your choices sometimes get you different items depending on who you give something to or how you kill the boss. @JonBams Remnant, I mean.
[2022-12-29 18:00:37] <%+Fireyedi> thats the humor

[2022-12-29 18:11:47] <%Mevad_> Cheer200 With kids, it's about setting boundaries.  The big thing I've realized since having a kid is that as long as you set the expectations "If this, then this" it helps them with school/society.  I rarely have to ground my 9 year old because she knows my expectations for school/home and she has freedom within certain boundaries.

[2022-12-29 18:20:54] <%rpgtheurge> The word "fresh" can have a few different meanings depending on the context in which it is used. Here are a few definitions that might be relevant: Recently made or obtained: This is the most common meaning of "fresh." Something that is fresh is new or has just been made or obtained. For example, you might say that a loaf of bread is fresh if it was just baked, or that a bunch of flowers is fresh if it was just picked from a garden.

[2022-12-29 19:27:09] <%$Maneo_86> I think in kids [icky eating either mirrors their parents, or its a way of the child regaining a feeling of control.
