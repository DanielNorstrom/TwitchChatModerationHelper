[2023-01-05 11:17:50] <%TheFitnessGamer> Bongo was the best?
[2023-01-05 11:18:01] <Tuppelura> I didn't like orisa before but now I love it :)
[2023-01-05 11:18:23] <nemebliss> I miss the bass drop when you put the bongo down so much though
[2023-01-05 11:18:38] VIEWERS: 231
[2023-01-05 11:18:38] <%TheFitnessGamer> the fact it stacks with nano etc, makes sense that it was so OP
[2023-01-05 11:19:05] <nemebliss> Bongo, window, damage boost. the good old times
[2023-01-05 11:20:05] <%TheFitnessGamer> Zarya's ult is more a displacement ult where as bongo was damage amping
[2023-01-05 11:20:16] <primate115> surprised orisa R winrate wasnt 50%, because both teams always had it...

[2023-01-05 11:20:53] <Dixi_25> :D
[2023-01-05 11:20:56] <nemebliss> zarya feels like it needs another dps ult to combo with. bongo just worked on its own
[2023-01-05 11:21:05] <i_i_capn_crunch> Bongo, nano, window and mercy dmg boost to a bastion. Good timez
[2023-01-05 11:21:44] <primate115> i think kiriko ult definitely "feels" a lot better, but yeh i got no idea
[2023-01-05 11:22:08] <ray_alexis> Who do you think is the best hitscan rn soldier, cass or Ashe?
[2023-01-05 11:22:18] <i_i_capn_crunch> Ashe
[2023-01-05 11:22:20] <i_i_capn_crunch> Imo

[2023-01-05 11:22:46] <i_i_capn_crunch> Soldier feels like he uses rubber bullets
[2023-01-05 11:22:52] <%+cheshirelime> Where is rammatra ult ranking
[2023-01-05 11:23:01] <xTaxedx> Who‚Äôs the best hero in the game at the moment is it hog?
[2023-01-05 11:23:17] <Shiratar_> orisa imo
[2023-01-05 11:23:20] <primate115> soldier has a pea shooter unless headshotting
[2023-01-05 11:23:39] <xTaxedx> And I think it‚Äôs soujourn has the best ultimate because she can 1 shot multiple people at once
[2023-01-05 11:23:42] <+Erreb88> Put down heal just before visor to skip the animation (it becomes instant)
[2023-01-05 11:24:14] <ray_alexis> I think soldier has insane value with mercy pocket and if your really good
[2023-01-05 11:24:20] <nemebliss> I can't play soldier anymore since they added the recoil (I'm on console). Bap is fine for me but I just can't deal with the recoil on Soldier :(
[2023-01-05 11:24:22] <xTaxedx> Sorjourn definitely has the best ultimate, she can wipe an entire team with her ultimate‚Ä¶.

[2023-01-05 11:25:01] <TheJayBiird> nah in terms of impact its still Kitsune changes the tide of the game in an instant
[2023-01-05 11:25:10] <primate115> ive seen a widow get 4 kills with 4 shots nothing better KEKW
[2023-01-05 11:25:15] <KiraisGod> kiriko ult is insane legit gives you all the buffs in the game
[2023-01-05 11:25:25] <%+cheshirelime> I also seen genji blade 4 ppl, doesn't make it the best
[2023-01-05 11:25:30] <stickmanstock> rammatra has a really good ult right now
[2023-01-05 11:25:32] <xTaxedx> Kitsune isn‚Äôt a good ultimate at all. It‚Äôs stupid how fast you shoot in it, it messes up my aim.
[2023-01-05 11:25:34] <TheJayBiird> it literally boosts everything for 5 people
[2023-01-05 11:25:46] <tecnou> @xTaxedx thats just skill issue

[2023-01-05 11:26:10] <nemebliss> and the new game mode thingy
[2023-01-05 11:26:14] <xTaxedx> What hog changes are coming?
[2023-01-05 11:26:15] <i_i_capn_crunch> Even if kitsune fuks up aim it still reduces cooldowns by half and allows healers to heals twice as fast
[2023-01-05 11:26:33] <i_i_capn_crunch> Idk if kitsune affect mercy beam rates tho
[2023-01-05 11:26:36] <nemebliss> supports not healers please

[2023-01-05 12:11:00] <vilmushh> It turns out there's a physiological reason coffee makes some people poop. Coffee's chemical makeup causes gastrin secretion, a hormone that stimulates the colon muscles. This gets bowel muscles moving for some people, sometimes necessitating a bathroom visit 2-3 minutes after drinking coffee. Source: google idk
[2023-01-05 12:11:00] <le_poke> has a chemical called gastrin makes u have the poopies
