[2022-12-20 22:00:20] <%bunglinglummox> @samiam1616 if you repeatedly set a dwarf on fire and put them out, letting them heal each time, eventually they run out of fat and become functionally fireproof

[2022-12-20 22:01:25] <%bunglinglummox> @meiramystery Yeah, DF doesn't use an abstract "damage" concept - fire hurts because it melts fat, which causes bleeding. No fat, no injury.

[2022-12-20 22:52:26] <%bunglinglummox> @Renkage and the guild hall feature ensures that all your woodcutters and bowyers will cross train as carpenters also... so almost everyone ends up expendable
