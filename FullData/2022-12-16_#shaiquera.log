[2022-12-16 09:50:26] <+Graehart> meta is like maxing stats. matching racial bonus to class
[2022-12-16 09:50:42] <+Graehart> I think it s more fun to play a character
[2022-12-16 09:51:04] <+Graehart> a woodelf warden sounds more interesting than a bog standard woodelf archer

[2022-12-16 10:28:23] <verdetech89> @MissDianaBlueberry  even though Skyrim was better for appearances, some of the older ES games had better dynamics and story imo....bad with names, the one b4 Skyrim was best :)
