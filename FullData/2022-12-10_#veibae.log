Or atleast tries to sound like one, aware of this. You try to sound neutrally hospitable and smart by asking if they're hungry or not before doing anything. And with her stomach literally audible growling, you insist that you 2 eat dinner somewhere else first, but also highlighting that its optional and that you could just buy her stuff at the station.
