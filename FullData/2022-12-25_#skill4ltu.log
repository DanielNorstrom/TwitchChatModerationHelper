[2022-12-25 16:16:54] <%Great_Briton> @Relyne The tank stats show you how much camo you lose when fire - you can see this in the ratings when you put equipment on. I also suspect it is only for the moment you fire. If someone does not spot you at that moment, your camo is back to normal

There is also switch over one game over another over time. However, it does not mean that game loosing players would not be profitable nor that they could make money same way.
