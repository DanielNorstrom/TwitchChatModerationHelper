[2022-12-26 10:54:08] <%the_nice_guy1000> the thing is it stays there forever if im in range and my team kinda gets put under pressure because of it
[2022-12-26 10:54:49] <@%AJ_ow_> If ramm ult is focused on you as rein that's good team heals you and you tank the aggro it's good
[2022-12-26 10:54:58] <@%AJ_ow_> ofc that's perfect situation
[2022-12-26 10:54:59] <thelaziest78> Ram is p2w?

[2022-12-26 13:01:48] <%jarttmvs> ball is hilarious
[2022-12-26 13:01:54] <endcosmos> against certain dps he just won't die
[2022-12-26 13:02:26] <Pr0phet_x0x> ball is just ok imo. cuz half the time his team doesn't know where to play without frontline tank
[2022-12-26 13:02:27] <white_tygga> you need like 3 ppl working in coordination to kill him
[2022-12-26 13:02:32] <+Xeffary> have u played against a ramattra yet?

[2022-12-26 15:03:18] <%EnnaCore> OW2 is -better- because single plays matter way more, I agree on that
[2022-12-26 15:03:18] <$TardigradesAreAwesome> and with individual skill mattering, bad players suck even more, good players carry more
[2022-12-26 15:03:21] VIEWERS: 545
[2022-12-26 15:03:22] <Shinsei> @rochijo It's easier to perform on an individual level in OW2 for a lot of players.
[2022-12-26 15:03:26] <%EnnaCore> and there is only 1 tank... = better
[2022-12-26 15:03:39] <%+Aceattack> do you also feel more % of games are dps diff in ow2

[2022-12-26 15:16:10] <+Xeffary> @Frondoll_ the thing is that rein isn't simple. he's easy to understand but knowing how to force melee engagements, knowing where to hold and when all requires good gamesense
[2022-12-26 15:16:25] <+Xeffary> hes a very matchup based character too i think
[2022-12-26 15:17:22] <imsippinteainurhood> i've poopy problems
[2022-12-26 15:17:28] VIEWERS: 522
[2022-12-26 15:17:32] <Shinsei> @Xeffary You're right, but that doesn't matter. All characters require the same type of skill in regards to positioning, etc. The thing about Rein is he's disadvantaged which means he should lose, which also means you require more skill to succeed to compensate for that disadvantage.
[2022-12-26 15:17:37] <Pr0phet_x0x> yea even if rein was strong he's still takes skill to play
[2022-12-26 15:18:13] <%EnnaCore> Rein prob needs the highest level of awareness
[2022-12-26 15:18:25] <%EnnaCore> maybe only similar with tracer nowadays? @LhCloudy27
[2022-12-26 15:18:29] <vivaelprincipe> Don't you just have to hold shield on Rein? Kappa
[2022-12-26 15:18:50] <$TardigradesAreAwesome> @vivaelprincipe in bronze, yeah
[2022-12-26 15:19:17] <%EnnaCore> I feel like players got so used to Tracers that hitting her is -easier- than before
[2022-12-26 15:19:18] <+Xeffary> @Xeffary no they dont because most characters have means of not being punished, like mobility. but rein has to commit those tools to get value in the first place
[2022-12-26 15:19:29] VIEWERS: 522
[2022-12-26 15:19:37] <Frondoll_> @Xeffary its not simple for u but he is simple
[2022-12-26 15:19:38] <+Xeffary> if a character's hard cuz they're bad. then they're a bad character more than a hard one
[2022-12-26 15:20:09] <+Xeffary> @Frondoll_ what elo are u on rein?
[2022-12-26 15:20:23] <Shinsei> @Xeffary It's different in regards to where you position because of his resources and the enemy resources. It's the same as every other character in that regard, however.
[2022-12-26 15:20:29] <@%aidreu> NOOO

[2022-12-26 16:34:16] <vivaelprincipe> @TheTurtleHax I think it was just mainly due to the pro side being more popular in Korea comparatively

[2022-12-26 16:36:25] <OneManArmystar> Doom's punch goes through, Brig's shield bash too, Sigma's rock too i think so why not charge
[2022-12-26 16:36:29] <$weeblord069> they should make it so you should be able to swing through the spin
[2022-12-26 16:37:01] <%cynderissuper> @blubberang its a stage below the highest level competiton known as Overwatch League or OWL. the players in contenders are usually picked up for OWL. you can watch them live on yt under the same name. they usually give out free contenders skins for watching live if your battlenet is connected to your yt

[2022-12-26 18:30:12] <mari9335> if they do they'll probably do it with their own IPs first, like cod or warcraft
[2022-12-26 18:30:30] <mari9335> nvm they already did it with warcraft

[2022-12-26 20:23:24] <@^Nightbot> My favorite streamer is LHChair. he is very dark, has great lumbar support, and honestly he carries the stream when Cloudy is gone. He comes equipped with a very powerful height adjusting lever that‚Äôs perfect for our favorite streamer. LHChair doesn‚Äôt interact much so it‚Äôs really helps when chat can make their own content

[2022-12-26 20:38:19] <+Elexelez> just give rein a constant 10% speed buff

[2022-12-26 20:38:32] <+jabbebe> It would be playable maybe
[2022-12-26 20:38:33] <abs_urdity> @jabbebe Rein is meant to be more susceptible to air heroes

[2022-12-26 20:38:56] <%cynderissuper> @jabbebe its a funny image but also not very realistic to be added as a whole bunch of work would have to be done on doom to actually make that happen
[2022-12-26 20:39:01] <%Apuphis> or your pin resets after a kill like genji imagine
[2022-12-26 20:39:13] <+Elexelez> rein hammer should do headshots

[2022-12-26 20:40:19] <%cynderissuper> @jabbebe there would still require rebalancing if that were to be added. idk what i would change but i wouldnt give up current rein for jump pack rein who might lose damage on swings or slower swing speed imo
[2022-12-26 20:40:29] <+jabbebe> Its not bad even its just a little something he could finnish someone up with

[2022-12-26 20:43:16] <%cynderissuper> @jabbebe you underestimate the implications of rein gaining even more mobility. Also it depends on how the jump works and how high and far he can go. But bottom line is i wouldnt change current rein for that cos the nerfs to compensate would be very severe
[2022-12-26 20:43:25] <+Elexelez> firestrike should be able to headshot with a 4x multiplier

[2022-12-26 20:46:44] <%cynderissuper> @jabbebe i dont have the energy to explain in great detail but giving rein the ability to avoid tanks like orisa or to avoid hog hooks and dive a bit like winston should be enough of an image to hopefully make you understand my reasoning. I'm not gonna argue anymore on this. YES I THINK IT WOULD BE FKIN SICK IF REIN COULD ROCKET JUMP but thinking it wouldnt need big nerfs to stop him from dominating is looking through rose coloured glasses my man

[2022-12-26 20:49:46] <+jabbebe> @cynderissuper you can see rein charging it up its not that bad and you wont dash or leap like winston and its not that high i dont see it as op you could only get to highground and smack a pharah but im cool to disagree but it shouldnt be that op we need to test it out

[2022-12-26 20:51:03] <%cynderissuper> @jabbebe sure man whatevs. if you design it to be a mini hop it would still need a slightly bigger nerf than just a cd increase on pin and the jump would need a high cd itself like 12 sec imo.
[2022-12-26 20:51:03] <vivaelprincipe> Can you show the high noon at some point?

[2022-12-26 21:29:45] <@%$PayMeToThrow> @y04rm0m I think its just a mistake like you already plan to cancel then randomly somene gets pinned you still cancel
