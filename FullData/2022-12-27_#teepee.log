[2022-12-27 14:50:34] <%+tritttycent> so yesterday I played for a bit for the first time in a while. My opinion: 1. I hate bots, get em out; 2. game audio needs buffed BAD; 3. money needs buffed and loadouts need dropped sooner. Played like 90% of my matches with ground loot; 4. need to double buy stations again

[2022-12-27 18:28:32] <%$SeymorKcusH> What happens after you complete it? Does it disappear in game 6?
[2022-12-27 18:28:36] <%$hammy_man_> I feel that. My squad doesn't play enough to win 5 in a row
[2022-12-27 18:28:37] <%$jake_new24> I don't think ive even played this game once yet

[2022-12-27 18:29:40] <+itztwiztedx> PixelBob
[2022-12-27 18:29:41] <%+GOGS08> duos is alot easier than trios and quads i think
[2022-12-27 18:29:42] <%greatodensravenn> I would win like 1/10 games in Caldera…
[2022-12-27 18:29:44] <$EralapseOG> i havent won a warzone game since verdansk
[2022-12-27 18:29:44] <%+menaceman754> I'd say a big part is the team aspect you guys play with. Having a consistent 4 guys is HUGE
[2022-12-27 18:29:46] <%+mjr_paranoia> I play 3 nights a week for about 4 hours each time and I get maybe 2 wins each night
[2022-12-27 18:29:47] <%juju_bean__> been 12 days since my last win. did set a WZ2 pr of 20 tho
[2022-12-27 18:29:47] <%a_k1ll3> Poll?
[2022-12-27 18:29:47] <%$HyphyBoricua510> @kasey_joseph lol yup shit game
[2022-12-27 18:29:48] <%Shameless_Gamer> I bet like 50/50
[2022-12-27 18:29:49] <%+paulythegreek> 90g+
[2022-12-27 18:29:49] <%Boatzzy> If the challenge was 10-20 kills and a top 5 i'd be the nuke king
[2022-12-27 18:29:49] <%+thurstee44> I sweat while playing sometimes, if that counts
[2022-12-27 18:29:54] <%ThadeusJohn> I get too impatient and want to run around end game.
[2022-12-27 18:29:55] <%+paulythegreek> 90%+
[2022-12-27 18:29:58] <MajesticBTP> I consider myself a sweat but my teammates are ass cheeks
[2022-12-27 18:30:00] <bigdman6969> I’m okay but always get smoked in the last 10
[2022-12-27 18:30:01] <%+bigscarymonk> @TeePee We usually try to get one win a night and that's pretty good for us haha (over a couple of hours)

[2022-12-27 18:30:06] <%+Siman1011> the whole squad has to be sweats in order to win that many in a row... its insanely difficult for casuals to win any amount in a row.
[2022-12-27 18:30:06] <%+thebigfriggentodd> do you think this game has skill based hit reg
[2022-12-27 18:30:07] <%$NillawTV> 89% then
[2022-12-27 18:30:08] <%JaxonBiggs> My squadmates can barely get 1 kill a game when I am getting 10+, so when playing duos its like solo duos basically lol
[2022-12-27 18:30:09] <Kranjos> Yeah I mean I have nearly 2000 CoD BR wins since Blackout released 4 and a bit years ago haha. So a bit of a sweat/grinder
[2022-12-27 18:30:10] <%$SeymorKcusH> @teepee what happens after you complete the nuke game? Do you get it in game 6?
[2022-12-27 18:30:12] <%Bones_60> I would say 63% could get a win in here
[2022-12-27 18:30:12] <%xkilo_exe> @boatzzy lol SAME BRO
[2022-12-27 18:30:13] <%$realNowknowN> IDK Who you think i am MR Teep 1 win a month
[2022-12-27 18:30:14] <%Got_Sou1l> we were on a 4 streak yesterday, and the SBMM kicked in and we got absolutely shredded on game 5 lol
[2022-12-27 18:30:18] <t_raw_22_> I’m decent but I just hate this game right now
[2022-12-27 18:30:22] <%+mrlivegaming78> I only have one solo win so far but as a team tho no wins
[2022-12-27 18:30:23] <%+Oceanz21> def not 90. I mean c'mon we got @kush06 and toothick? goats.
[2022-12-27 18:30:23] <$daddydiaziii> That would be 520 people getting a win right
[2022-12-27 18:30:23] <@%+LippMatt> I recently won a 1v1 against my 6 year old nephew so you could say I’m pretty sweaty

[2022-12-27 18:50:43] <@%^Streamlabs> TeeP enjoys the core gameplay of WZ 2.0. Loves the look and feel of the map. TeeP prefers free loadout to be during 1st circle and more money economy on the map. Hitching/Lagging is an issue as well. TeeP loves the game so far and looks forward to quality of life improvements. TeeP does not know what the exact meta will be for the game, but the meta will probably evolve quickly as it did for WZ 1. TeeP will be using a variety of loadouts. - !guns for more info

[2022-12-27 19:21:37] <%+MiggyMxG> @itsz_drippy riot shield isn’t too bad. Sometimes you get lucky and some people on the other team help. But launchers are ok but the Jokr isn’t fun
[2022-12-27 19:21:45] <benjochito1> @itsz_drippy cant you avoid grinding riot and some launchers if you get the platinum for the newly added guns? or do they not count?
