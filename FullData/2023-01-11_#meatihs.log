[2023-01-11 00:08:04] <sonofman1930> He was going slow and then just popped off 1 turn.
[2023-01-11 00:08:14] <+honawee> didn't have a board on Turn 5
[2023-01-11 00:08:55] <NathXVI> he had the spell damage minion also with predations, I think he misplayed

[2023-01-11 00:25:18] <+HarryLivermore> If mental health services weren’t so poor in this country people wouldn’t be homeless most homeless people are mental health strugglers who have been majorly let down
