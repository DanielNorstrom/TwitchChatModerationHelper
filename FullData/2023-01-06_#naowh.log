[2023-01-06 16:47:16] <%+Ayasira> @Skwih damage is a dot debuff, debuff goes away when wall despawns, but tbh looking at the damage I don't think it even matters they could just walk through it and eat the full 15s LUL

[2023-01-06 16:47:23] <Keronari> if the wall is going to disappear anyway, is there any point running the whole way through or does it do more damage standing in it?

[2023-01-06 16:48:11] <Keronari> @Keronari Yeah I know but what I mean is could you just stand at the very end and not move at all?
[2023-01-06 16:48:13] <Redding123> the point is you get 15sec dot when you cross the line, but the dot will disappear together with the adds so you will not get full duration that's my understanding

[2023-01-06 17:41:10] <%Raptorskulz> @Wannabe_Dough no, we're talking about getting aggro, once a tank has aggro it's much easier to maintain than to get aggro after all the dps take aggro on pull. So dps over 20 secs doesn't matter as much as inital snap aggro
