[2022-12-19 15:51:41] <ConeCorvid> @JuJoLo13 GUIDING LIGHT: Upon casting your ultimate, you Transcend for 9 seconds. While Transcended, increase your maximum health by 10% and cause you and all allies within Range center.png 1200 units to gain 20 basic ability haste and Heal power icon.png heal for 2% of your maximum health upon you becoming Transcended and every 3 seconds thereafter. Ally healing is increased by 0% − 100% (based on target's missing health) (60 second cooldown).
