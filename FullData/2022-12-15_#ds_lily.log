[2022-12-15 17:11:25] <@%Kuglorf> it is thematically silly that leather armor does not absorb any blows

[2022-12-15 17:34:39] <%Useless_Eater> @starlight_aria yeah but it would be cool to get to speed up the early early lvling with some damage nodes
[2022-12-15 17:34:41] <%LordTekkless> ur stun is pretty good now
[2022-12-15 17:34:55] <tychosnose> when does the smoke bomb guy actually damage you? I don't get him
[2022-12-15 17:34:56] <@%^Nightbot> i dunno
[2022-12-15 17:35:04] <RedDragn83> undecember or poe? which has more quality?
[2022-12-15 17:35:08] <%Nite01> this is better than my seismic for sure
[2022-12-15 17:35:09] <%Nite01> LOLW
[2022-12-15 17:35:19] <%+starlight_aria> @Useless_Eater but does it really matter for those few lvls anyway, its not like its gonna be a huge difference early
[2022-12-15 17:35:20] <%LordTekkless> yea endur on stun is giga
[2022-12-15 17:35:22] <%LordTekkless> another 20%
[2022-12-15 17:35:30] <%LordTekkless> are you eventually going maces ?
[2022-12-15 17:35:36] <%LordTekkless> or just gona get a giga axe

[2022-12-15 17:38:07] <+gotthisbro> how can one build do this much damage?
[2022-12-15 17:38:07] <@%^Nightbot> very carefully
[2022-12-15 17:38:52] <%Useless_Eater> @starlight_aria not for that character, but in the long run across multiple characters it could SHRUGGERS I'd also really like having the choice there between going tanky or damage
[2022-12-15 17:40:02] <%Useless_Eater> it's just as it is, the damage route doesnt do much for scaling the actually good early leveling skills, either a shift there or a rework in the nodes themselves would change that
[2022-12-15 17:40:03] <bartIed00kie> yes
