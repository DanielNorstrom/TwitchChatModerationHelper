[2023-01-10 13:05:13] <@^Nightbot> Hello Mr Florryworry COGGERS I see you haven't been getting "Separatists Sentiment" event recently. This event is caused by having more than 100% overextension when you take enough provinces from enemy. It seems you're not expanding fast enough then. Try to take more land in the next war. I hope this helps :)
