[2022-12-10 16:45:11] <+leddiable> It depends on the girl, and how shy she is. If she is giving signs that she wants it or not.  If you are just friends, it can be tough to make a move, given that you risk the loss of friendship

[2022-12-10 20:13:15] <Icegiant> @nm_titanium The champion orbs are determined at the time of opening, not when they are dropped
[2022-12-10 20:13:21] <GodOfMonsters> @nm_titanium you should hold high cost units from shop before opening orbs
[2022-12-10 20:13:34] <+nm_titanium> ok i see

[2022-12-10 20:13:41] <+Absolunacy> @nm_titanium basically it's better to wait to open the orb, cause you will want to roll until you have 8 of the champ and then get one guaranteed from the orb
