[2022-12-07 12:47:41] <YosefYoStar> listen here mutant man, you came to the wrong hood! manZAPL manR manZAPR
[2022-12-07 12:47:41] <Matz050> Seems like Soldiers of Workedfloors aren't durable. They are described as small feathered humanoids...
[2022-12-07 12:47:48] <+ranger225500> it either has really low combat skills or our dwarfs are just hidden death gods
[2022-12-07 12:47:51] <LairdCuddles> seems so @suomi921
[2022-12-07 12:47:53] <%frisson42> seems that weapons might be a plan
[2022-12-07 12:48:05] <TrueEgon> There is tick by tick option.
[2022-12-07 12:48:22] <Ljosapaldr> @TrueEgon where, it's a different hotkey then
[2022-12-07 12:48:22] <%eyeofmagi> sounds like he just got rejected
[2022-12-07 12:48:22] <%$suomi921> is this anew fort?
[2022-12-07 12:48:26] <+ranger225500> novice in everything but its 264 years old?
[2022-12-07 12:48:29] <%eyeofmagi> @suomi921 yes

[2022-12-07 12:48:43] <%leafypew> You can limit framerate to slow the game down... Lot of faffing tho....
[2022-12-07 12:48:52] <%$suomi921> what happened to the tutorial fort?
[2022-12-07 12:48:58] <legeonxzero> tis but a flesh wound
[2022-12-07 12:49:07] <%eyeofmagi> @suomi921 zombies
[2022-12-07 12:49:13] <TrueEgon> @suomi921  6 undead raiders happened.
[2022-12-07 12:49:16] <arrean> In classic version there was a way to advance frame by frame. Not sure if it's in steam version @Aavak , might be worth a look in keybinding menu
[2022-12-07 12:49:22] <%$suomi921> ah
[2022-12-07 12:49:29] <+Saliosnoctin> Well even though I can't sleep I need to find something to stay up so I don't completely ruin my sleeping hours ^^; Take care Aavak and I do hope you are enjoying the game. Enjoy the stream chat peeps
[2022-12-07 12:49:33] <YosefYoStar> hazvsThink
[2022-12-07 12:49:39] <+ranger225500> it would work this thing looks weak
[2022-12-07 12:49:41] <LairdCuddles> do it
[2022-12-07 12:49:56] <+ranger225500> the miners might be enough
[2022-12-07 12:49:56] <+iron3ide> q

[2022-12-07 12:50:51] <+ranger225500> eh thats to many titles imo
[2022-12-07 12:50:59] <+ranger225500> i normaly make my hunter the MC

[2022-12-07 12:51:14] <+ranger225500> or miner
[2022-12-07 12:51:14] <TrueEgon> how hard is it to save scum in this version ? Is it as easy as in older versions ?
[2022-12-07 12:51:26] <+ranger225500> why would you tho
[2022-12-07 12:51:32] <+ranger225500> losing is fun
[2022-12-07 12:51:40] <BearOndaBus> So how do you like the Steam version of DF?
[2022-12-07 12:51:40] <Light_Sentinel> ^
[2022-12-07 12:51:50] <$InfernDragon> Back. Is Aavak being invaded?
[2022-12-07 12:51:52] <TrueEgon> @ranger225500  Yes but after 10 deaths I start to value my time.
[2022-12-07 12:52:10] <@DemiOfDerp> @InfernDragon We have no idea. The sounds were there when we arrived
[2022-12-07 12:52:42] VIEWERS: 1 274
[2022-12-07 12:52:43] <+TriggersDown> i check in on this game every now and then bc im fascinated. im happy to see i can now tell what is going on on the screen instead of a million strange letters
[2022-12-07 12:52:49] <+TriggersDown> acting as a symbol for things
[2022-12-07 12:52:59] <+TriggersDown> idk if thats the steam version or how new that is
[2022-12-07 12:53:07] <joroba2gaming> You need to set them on duty
[2022-12-07 12:53:15] <TrueEgon> @TriggersDown  tilesets were a thing for a long time but the new look sure is sweet.
[2022-12-07 12:53:22] <+Tuvan84> i have goblin ghosts running around in my fort, i built memorial slabs bu they won't go away
[2022-12-07 12:53:33] <$InfernDragon> So it seems "I lost two dogs to wild animals because I though the battle sounds were just part of the ambient music and didn't realize it was an "alert""
[2022-12-07 12:53:37] <+TriggersDown> wait did this game just release on steam today
[2022-12-07 12:53:47] <%+DR0P_TABLE> I literally have so litle cluye what the hell is even happening
[2022-12-07 12:53:49] <Upuauta2> yesterday
[2022-12-07 12:53:53] <+TriggersDown> sheeeeeiiiiiiiiiiit
[2022-12-07 12:53:56] <+TriggersDown> and it looks great
[2022-12-07 12:54:07] <$InfernDragon> It got released on the 6th Trigger
[2022-12-07 12:54:09] <+TriggersDown> does the non-steam version look like this too
[2022-12-07 12:54:10] <TrueEgon> Tyson POv
[2022-12-07 12:54:19] <%EntropicRadar> @DR0P_TABLE some random undead thing showed up and is getting the mosh pit treatment.
[2022-12-07 12:54:19] <+TriggersDown> or is it still strange letter symbols
[2022-12-07 12:54:23] <+ranger225500> seems like we embarked in the middle of a battlefield. classic dwarfs "them Long Legs be fighting again boss""its fine if they stray to far into our claim we will just *Thin the herd* as they say, plus we can feed the animals easier"
[2022-12-07 12:54:28] <FuzzyChimp> Will this be one other one of Aavak's YouTube channels later?
[2022-12-07 12:54:31] <+Fleetah> Is that a recruit a headcrab?
[2022-12-07 12:54:38] <TrueEgon> @TriggersDown  nope, the basic version is still ASCII unless you modify it.
[2022-12-07 12:54:41] <FlagshipKongou> @TriggersDown non steam remains the ascii-'art' style.

[2022-12-07 12:54:46] <Bihlbo> Speaking of combat, I did an adventure mode run not long ago, and leapt at the chance to play as a rhino man. The horn gore meta was amazing.
[2022-12-07 12:54:54] <+Chalkstix> wait, there's tendons inside the skull? O_o
[2022-12-07 12:54:57] <$InfernDragon> @TriggersDown This is the base game graphics right now on the steam version
[2022-12-07 12:55:07] <+ranger225500> there are chalk
[2022-12-07 12:55:18] <+Chalkstix> fair
[2022-12-07 12:55:35] <YosefYoStar> hazvsOoo
[2022-12-07 12:55:37] <+ranger225500> at least it sounds right to me
[2022-12-07 12:55:43] <+ranger225500> To Google!
[2022-12-07 12:55:52] <+SplotchDog> that dwarf is trying to open him up like a stubborn bag of crisps
[2022-12-07 12:55:54] <Matz050> Note that it's also out on Itch, you don't need to be a Steam user to get the premium version.
[2022-12-07 12:55:56] <TrueEgon> Lynching time.
[2022-12-07 12:55:59] <dragon7526> It's always a laugh to look at the combat.
[2022-12-07 12:56:00] <Bihlbo> Yeah, muscles use tendons to attach to bones
[2022-12-07 12:56:02] <Matz050> The Linux and Mac builds aren't out yet though
[2022-12-07 12:56:07] <+ranger225500> Over the dome of the skull the epicranium is formed by a sheet of tendon that's known as the galea
[2022-12-07 12:56:07] <joroba2gaming> Literal ghoul behaviour (but remember to set your militia on active duty)
[2022-12-07 12:56:23] <+ranger225500> yep google says there are tendons
[2022-12-07 12:56:38] <+Chalkstix> @ranger225500 I don't doubt it, but that sounds like outside the skull to me
[2022-12-07 12:56:42] VIEWERS: 1 294
[2022-12-07 12:56:46] <+LAWolves> Tossed it about like a dog with his toy
[2022-12-07 12:56:54] <+Ramonster163> Brutal
[2022-12-07 12:56:59] <+ranger225500> wait inside?
[2022-12-07 12:57:15] <+Chalkstix> the game said tendons inside the skull yeah :>
[2022-12-07 12:57:24] <LairdCuddles> schedule off duty for work
[2022-12-07 12:57:35] <TrueEgon> If you turn your dog into a roast it does not matter if it is wounded. SUBprise
[2022-12-07 12:57:40] <%+Onred> No cats are safe dprPAW
[2022-12-07 12:57:42] <+SplotchDog> the combat in this game is hilariously specific. you can grapple people by their damn wizdom tooth if you like
[2022-12-07 12:57:48] <+ranger225500> Suboccipital muscles: Four muscles just below the occipital bone at the base of your skull. They help extend your head in different directions
[2022-12-07 12:57:58] <+ranger225500> all i got
[2022-12-07 12:58:09] <$InfernDragon> I like the part where you can grapple someone by the heart and do Kalimar Kappa
[2022-12-07 12:58:15] <%Atlas_Reign> my internet pooped its self anyone  got a clip of that fight log
[2022-12-07 12:58:21] <TrueEgon> @SplotchDog Rip off their thong and beat them with it.
[2022-12-07 12:58:44] <YosefYoStar> such a great finishing move

[2022-12-07 12:58:45] <+SplotchDog> kinky
[2022-12-07 12:58:57] <%EntropicRadar> @Atlas_Reign you ever seen a dog shake around a toy? imagine a dwarf doing that with a small humanoids neckk
[2022-12-07 12:59:06] <LairdCuddles> but a good start
[2022-12-07 12:59:10] <+shymson> 6 from bottom left
[2022-12-07 12:59:10] <vaporizer13> refuse?
[2022-12-07 12:59:15] <+Godlypwng> read one dwarf rip off another dwarfs foot with his mouth

[2022-12-07 12:59:29] <vaporizer13> corpses
[2022-12-07 12:59:33] <%Atlas_Reign> yikes sounds effective lol
[2022-12-07 12:59:41] <+SplotchDog> would love to see that fight captured in some beautiful dwarvern art
[2022-12-07 12:59:41] <TrueEgon> The fights in this game can be very brutal.
[2022-12-07 12:59:44] <YosefYoStar> you will want horns too
[2022-12-07 12:59:52] <+Godlypwng> an unarmed dwarf is a scary dwarf
[2022-12-07 12:59:57] <%EntropicRadar> dwarf was ANGRY it hurt his dog
[2022-12-07 13:00:11] <$InfernDragon> @Godlypwng I miss the time they'd use babies as weapons
[2022-12-07 13:00:29] <+LAWolves> Maybe we'll be able to get AI-generated representations of the dwarven artworks one day...
[2022-12-07 13:00:34] <+Godlypwng> apparently babies were or are still immortal kill stealers?
[2022-12-07 13:00:43] <Hupsaiya> the mutants corpse in the stash LUL

[2022-12-07 13:00:50] <YosefYoStar> amazing
[2022-12-07 13:00:56] <+ranger225500> babys arnt immortal at all in DF
[2022-12-07 13:01:13] <$InfernDragon> Then the other time where Babies would ride their mothers and tire the mothers out... making them die of exhaustion :P
[2022-12-07 13:01:21] <TrueEgon> Also in older versions terrifying biomes were basicly Evil Dead territory, where ALL cut off parts would reanimate and try to kill you some more.
[2022-12-07 13:01:31] <+Chalkstix> that squeaking sound is pretty intense
[2022-12-07 13:01:39] <$InfernDragon> True, That was when i was playing :P
[2022-12-07 13:01:46] <+ranger225500> babys can and will die seconds after being born in DF
[2022-12-07 13:01:53] <reifoxfire> oh cool you can see the roots of the trees
[2022-12-07 13:02:00] <Light_Sentinel> can we bury or burn the bodies of the non-etable? or is it just time that will get rid of those corpses?
[2022-12-07 13:02:25] <+LAWolves> Can anyone explain what is he digging all around the stockpile?
[2022-12-07 13:02:36] <+Godlypwng> slopes
[2022-12-07 13:02:37] <TrueEgon> A goblin cut of my dwarf hand and the hand tried to choke the dwarf it belonged to. Et tu, Brute ?
[2022-12-07 13:02:38] <+ranger225500> once i hit lava i normaly have a dump over it that i toss all my trash into
[2022-12-07 13:02:44] VIEWERS: 1 275
[2022-12-07 13:02:48] <+SplotchDog> Would it be worth marking that corpse to be dumped?
[2022-12-07 13:03:05] <%EntropicRadar> season change, time for more undead things :D
[2022-12-07 13:03:08] <TrueEgon> @LAWolves  Because Aavak wants to stay on the surface and experience all the FUN.
[2022-12-07 13:03:20] <+LAWolves> So cool we have this amount of control!
[2022-12-07 13:03:35] <+ranger225500> inb4 !SIEGE!
[2022-12-07 13:03:37] <TrueEgon> @SplotchDog  Not unless it is among your workshops or underground inside the fort.
[2022-12-07 13:04:00] <sonicblade38> ive yet to get the dwarves to move a corse before its starts miasmaing the whole place
[2022-12-07 13:04:12] <+ranger225500> thats normal DF
[2022-12-07 13:04:18] <+SplotchDog> @TrueEgon Right, but as a humanoid corpse I believe dwarves will be upset seeing it as they go about hauling
[2022-12-07 13:04:45] VIEWERS: 1 275
[2022-12-07 13:04:49] <TrueEgon> @SplotchDog  Ever heard about de-sensitazion training for your dwarves ?
[2022-12-07 13:05:06] <+LAWolves> Ofc DF had to come out when I'm full-send studying for my graduation... BibleThump
[2022-12-07 13:05:09] <+SplotchDog> yeah! quite horrific really
[2022-12-07 13:05:22] <YosefYoStar> @TrueEgon yah burn that thing already, its a horrifying mutant thing sandwichFingunz
[2022-12-07 13:05:26] <+ranger225500> danger rooms are still a thing?
[2022-12-07 13:05:26] <+TriggersDown> @TrueEgon lol this comment giving me flashbacks to my friend who was a fighter pilot tell me about the higher ups talking about if theres a civilization under the ocean/underground
[2022-12-07 13:05:35] <joroba2gaming> I think chairs are.
[2022-12-07 13:05:35] <%$Alexspeed75> That creatures corpse is also in the stockpile. To be butchered?
[2022-12-07 13:05:41] <R2Samu> How old is this fort?
[2022-12-07 13:05:43] <joroba2gaming> now a thing*
[2022-12-07 13:05:50] <@DemiOfDerp> Fort is babbeh
[2022-12-07 13:05:54] <%Kerowynn> Fell asleep and woke up to a new fort... how many forts has he done this stream?
[2022-12-07 13:06:18] <+SplotchDog> would be nice if there was a way of actually disposing of things, rather than just moving them out of sight. Atom Smashers are always an option, but they feel so much like an exploit
[2022-12-07 13:06:18] <%EntropicRadar> this is the second one, Kero
[2022-12-07 13:06:22] <%Kerowynn> Cheers
[2022-12-07 13:06:23] <TrueEgon> @Kerowynn I think it is the second.
[2022-12-07 13:06:44] <yaboiselka> @splotchdog infinite dumping pile?
[2022-12-07 13:06:44] <+ranger225500> first one had the friendly Necromancer show up first season change

[2022-12-07 13:07:00] <+TriggersDown> @SplotchDog can you burn your garbage?
[2022-12-07 13:07:00] <yaboiselka> Into magma
[2022-12-07 13:07:03] <+ranger225500> @SplotchDog dwarven atom smasher
[2022-12-07 13:07:09] <R2Samu> Sounds like FUN
[2022-12-07 13:07:11] <+SplotchDog> @yaboiselka it's still on the map, just in the pile
[2022-12-07 13:07:17] <TrueEgon> @TriggersDown  I think you can AtomSmash it.
[2022-12-07 13:07:36] <yaboiselka> Added the molten cheese/magma into the mix after the fact.
[2022-12-07 13:07:39] <%EntropicRadar> and i think bodies Decay into nothingness with time
[2022-12-07 13:07:49] <yaboiselka> Magma does the job well enough for most things
[2022-12-07 13:07:56] <+ranger225500> just a bridge and a lever in a room stuff goes under the bridge lover the bridge and stuff gets atomized
[2022-12-07 13:08:01] <%EntropicRadar> thoguh, i recognizes that may be wires being crossed with rimworld.
[2022-12-07 13:08:03] <+KMOneGaming> so did last stream settlement fail? or just start a new one because
[2022-12-07 13:08:05] <+SplotchDog> dropping things in lava lakes or volcanoes has worked for me, but that's not always an option
[2022-12-07 13:08:15] <LairdCuddles> do they slaughter all your stock?
[2022-12-07 13:08:34] <R2Samu> What's the plan for this fort then?
[2022-12-07 13:08:35] <ArminiusSilvanus> Is this completely vanilla?

[2022-12-07 13:08:53] <%EntropicRadar> i believe so, Armin
[2022-12-07 13:08:58] <TrueEgon> @ArminiusSilvanus  Steam vanilla is totally different from regular vanilla
[2022-12-07 13:09:00] <yaboiselka> For animals you have to do it in the menu. -
[2022-12-07 13:09:03] <@DemiOfDerp> Yup. is vanilla
[2022-12-07 13:09:12] <%EntropicRadar> and i dont think Aavaks gotten far enough to have a "plan"
[2022-12-07 13:09:22] <TrueEgon> @EntropicRadar  KEK
[2022-12-07 13:09:31] <@DemiOfDerp> Aavak's plan is "not die"
[2022-12-07 13:09:37] <sonicblade38> elven sorcery is afoot
[2022-12-07 13:09:37] <yaboiselka> Cave seeds need cave soil too. Found diminishing returns for sub-surface farms. Could be wrong tho
[2022-12-07 13:09:41] <TrueEgon> Mission objective - Survive
[2022-12-07 13:09:48] <+ranger225500> and so far its working
[2022-12-07 13:09:50] <+SplotchDog> always wanted to make a strawberry farm in this game, and make strawberry wine for all my dwarves
[2022-12-07 13:10:19] <LairdCuddles> ok... was just concerned about "cow lever" (cooking materials)

[2022-12-07 13:11:18] <yaboiselka> Couldn’t you? I thought it was available for awhile. @splotchdog
[2022-12-07 13:11:53] <@DemiOfDerp> Every day, if there's an excess of stone, make crafts?
[2022-12-07 13:12:25] <TrueEgon> So early human civilization used doogs because they could help in defence/hunting and in emergency they are meat. good to keep this in mind in this game.
[2022-12-07 13:12:25] <+SplotchDog> @yaboiselka you can, I just never managed to get it going
[2022-12-07 13:12:29] <+ranger225500> ah right balista
[2022-12-07 13:12:32] <yaboiselka> Ah
[2022-12-07 13:12:36] <+ranger225500> those fun things

[2022-12-07 13:12:53] <+Zerstiren> Anyone worked out how to change to ASCII yet or is that on added now?
[2022-12-07 13:12:54] <yaboiselka> Should be even easier to do now where you can designate storages for workshops to pull from
[2022-12-07 13:13:07] <%+Talausia> Does the random pig squealing sound ever stop? lol.
[2022-12-07 13:13:16] <@DemiOfDerp> @Zerstiren No ASCII yet last time I checked. it's in the works though
[2022-12-07 13:13:27] <+Zerstiren> @DemiOfDerp Nice one, thanks
[2022-12-07 13:13:33] <yaboiselka> @talausia only if you kill the ambiance in settings
[2022-12-07 13:13:54] <yaboiselka> Or underground
[2022-12-07 13:14:04] <yaboiselka> I think
[2022-12-07 13:14:26] <@DemiOfDerp> For workshops or just in general?
[2022-12-07 13:14:32] <+SplotchDog> you get 4 blocks per log/stone
[2022-12-07 13:14:35] <SADEyX> I think blocks are more efficient on material use?
[2022-12-07 13:14:36] <Ljosapaldr> blocks are much more resource efficient and enemies climb worse on them
[2022-12-07 13:14:46] <MyInternetBroke> It matters more for rocks because you can get 4 blocks per stone, for wood I think it's 1 per. But it is faster to transport and build

[2022-12-07 13:14:48] <SADEyX> and yea, crafting blocks skills up dwarf
[2022-12-07 13:14:49] <Bihlbo> Blocks are better than boulders, because they weigh less and are easier to carry to the spot. But logs are also light. Just as good.
[2022-12-07 13:14:53] <yaboiselka> Workshops -not that I’m aware of. Blocks are best for large constructions
[2022-12-07 13:15:32] <+ranger225500> entrance hallway with a balista behind embrasures. the Dwarf version of "Get Off My Lawn"
[2022-12-07 13:16:02] <@DemiOfDerp> Year 500+
[2022-12-07 13:16:05] <Matz050> Well then.

[2022-12-07 13:16:14] <@DemiOfDerp> Necromancy and goblins
[2022-12-07 13:16:25] <%+Klawzie> Your emblem IS a necromancer...
[2022-12-07 13:16:28] <%+Dunkurtin> This is exactly why you went only 100 years last night XD
[2022-12-07 13:16:29] <+SplotchDog> age of the necrogoblins
[2022-12-07 13:16:36] <Matz050> I'm sure this person is trustworthy! Look at all these glowing reviews they've gotten from beyond the grave!

[2022-12-07 13:16:49] <PureBlackHaze> what about necromancer crabs?
[2022-12-07 13:16:57] <+TriggersDown> thats funny i watched a youtube video called "why do things keep evolving into crabs?"
[2022-12-07 13:17:03] <+TriggersDown> you really know your stuff aavak
[2022-12-07 13:17:10] <%the_kakaze> undead wood
[2022-12-07 13:17:14] <@DemiOfDerp> And I have found that it's barely affected by how many secrets of life and death you add to your world at start. As long as there's one there'll be necromancers, eventually
[2022-12-07 13:17:17] <LairdCuddles> all ways ends in necromancy ;D
[2022-12-07 13:17:36] <yaboiselka> This outpost liaison needs to be sent else where. I can see him causing all sorts of fun at a spook
[2022-12-07 13:18:00] <@DemiOfDerp> We could "contain" the liaison
[2022-12-07 13:18:01] <+Gniwii> @Aavak I havent played DF in a long time havethey added spells to actually DO necromancy?
[2022-12-07 13:18:03] <DRataJuega> once one of my dwarves killed every other member of the fort, butchered them, put their bones into the crafting station and created a legendary cursed bone sword. that was epic for me
[2022-12-07 13:18:30] <@DemiOfDerp> Armies?
[2022-12-07 13:18:31] <Hietsom> wait how did you zoom?

[2022-12-07 13:20:45] <@DemiOfDerp> Necromancers can raise dead, even when they're your necromancers, but not on command

[2022-12-07 13:21:13] <Hietsom> yeah but this only works in the embark screen... well... maybe my resolution is to high
[2022-12-07 13:21:21] <TrueEgon> @DemiOfDerp  They have something like "get up" aura lol
[2022-12-07 13:21:40] <Hietsom> thanks anyway
[2022-12-07 13:21:44] <@DemiOfDerp> Yeah, they just randomly ressurect stuff around them
[2022-12-07 13:21:45] <$InfernDragon> If you wanted to do the migrant thing. Couldn't you just name your dwarves?
[2022-12-07 13:22:01] <Ghostblade95> @Hietsom to zoom in during fort mode its CTRL+mousewheel to zoom in/out.
[2022-12-07 13:22:03] <TrueEgon> That terrifying message "Some migrants have arrived" embrace 20 new professional soap makers.
[2022-12-07 13:22:31] <SimonSez> Zooming is done by scrollwheel and CTRL+Scrollwheel? I think
[2022-12-07 13:22:37] <reifoxfire> gonna go to bed, goodnight
[2022-12-07 13:22:37] <@DemiOfDerp> I think that can be changed in settings
[2022-12-07 13:22:44] <Ghostblade95> roflgatorYep

[2022-12-07 13:23:19] <@DemiOfDerp> Aavak is too responsible for our good
[2022-12-07 13:23:19] <%nyhirai_> this is hilarious xd. on the DF steam page there is a guy asking: "there are thousands of day1 reviews for this game. have all those ppl been playing free df for 25years, just waiting for an opportunity to pay for it?" and it has SIXTY pages of just "yes" answers xd
