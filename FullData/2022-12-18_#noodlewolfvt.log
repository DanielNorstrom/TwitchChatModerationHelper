[2022-12-18 21:11:11] <TheDreadedDuke> @leoen79 saw it portrayed in the New Guy. i dont think it showes the true pain...
[2022-12-18 21:11:23] <%Shizounu> yes, but due to some people missing some bones it averages oout. So we dont need to fear the skeli bois outnumbering us too badly
[2022-12-18 21:11:33] <%+itsTauto> hi all o/
[2022-12-18 21:11:40] <itismewelshnobleguy5> Hi I literally just came in and all I heard was abour this guys ‘body part’ and no clue what thing you were talking about, is it a tv show?
[2022-12-18 21:11:56] <%leoen79> and tell your girlfriend and or Boyfriend and or nonbinaryfriend to be careful with your stick
[2022-12-18 21:12:05] <%nojouplays> I have a question why do we need to be itchy and why is the natural response to scratch if it just makes it worse

[2022-12-18 21:12:56] <%Shizounu> @nojouplays itchy ness is usually an indicator of poisons. Scratching it open was/is a way to get the poisoned blood out
[2022-12-18 21:13:00] <%nojouplays> It should just be pain

[2022-12-18 21:13:52] <%nojouplays> Its very annoying
[2022-12-18 21:14:01] <%leoen79> Itches can also just be for example like my leg at the moment is laying ontop of the heater and the heat difference is making me itchy
[2022-12-18 21:14:19] <%Shizounu> I like that the immune system is metal enough to just challenge bacteria by saying "I will heat this body up till one of us dies, and I do not care which of us it is"
[2022-12-18 21:14:55] <%nojouplays> Also i started scratching my arm today and i ended up spending like 10 minutes scratching off 2 years worth of dead skin from my body
