[2022-12-19 01:41:49] <PAPA_ANTONZ> That's why quins so popular ppl dont want to watch ppl playing just stalling
[2022-12-19 01:41:50] <+madebylove> quinXD
[2022-12-19 01:41:53] <%alluviumearth> they even have a stall ult move called a time out
[2022-12-19 01:41:56] <sir_irk> baseball is mostly downtime

[2022-12-19 21:26:35] <satsuinotanden> Its probably coded similar to d2 where theres a damage amplifier vs minions. Either that or its just they have no defenses outside of what u give them and their base stats like hp/es

[2022-12-19 21:48:43] <%Nite01> it would be pretty much always better to not take it I guess
[2022-12-19 21:48:49] <!%renbeep> maybe like a unique unset ring "Auras socketed in this ring may stack ontop of other instances of the same aura"

He was very unamused. :(

[2022-12-19 23:36:54] <+JaYmazing13> @jaydosk he found it by mistake
[2022-12-19 23:37:12] <!%Bisholio> wait how long was it known about?

[2022-12-19 23:38:26] <+JaYmazing13> def a fairly cheap recipe compared to what the jewel was worth on previous leagues
[2022-12-19 23:38:28] <!%Bisholio> that apparently still exist
[2022-12-19 23:38:38] <TOOfunkedUP> @Bisholio they're a secret :)
[2022-12-19 23:38:47] <+JaYmazing13> the chinese guy who found it sold the jewel for 20 div and didnt tell anyone
