[2022-12-27 00:15:02] <%LaLaBriar> it shows what block you're looking at
[2022-12-27 00:15:07] VIEWERS: 397
[2022-12-27 00:15:17] <%LaLaBriar> like an overlay at the top of the screen
[2022-12-27 00:15:19] <%+bdpnguins> Jade is basically gives you the overview of what is the block and what is inside chests
[2022-12-27 00:16:12] <%+sarcastic_minion> LUL
[2022-12-27 00:16:14] <%+bdpnguins> You can configure it in your keybinds

[2022-12-27 00:16:26] <%LaLaBriar> ^
[2022-12-27 00:16:35] <+SuiteSunrise> you'd have to see if it's bound to something after the vault

[2022-12-27 00:16:43] <CrackedSkelly> @bdpnguins i dont think it would help since you still need to open the chest to geneerate the contents of it
[2022-12-27 00:16:51] <%+sarcastic_minion> there TKL keyboards

[2022-12-27 03:48:21] <%samm35_> hitting the same number on a dice 4 times that has an 8% chance to land on each side would be 1/2000
[2022-12-27 03:48:25] <%KiiWiiiii> well it isnt, because not everything is weighted the same, so there are other variables in it i believe
[2022-12-27 03:48:33] <%samm35_> hitting a specific number would be 1/25000
[2022-12-27 03:48:48] <%samm35_> its the difference between 8%^4 and 8%^3
[2022-12-27 03:48:56] <+rdschmid> regardless of weightings etc, there is a final probablility
[2022-12-27 03:49:13] <%morpheus7078> what other variables? if we know it's 8%
[2022-12-27 03:49:15] <%RoseSebastian> the other factors don't affect the probability
[2022-12-27 03:49:15] <%samm35_> regardless its still very unlikely
[2022-12-27 03:49:24] VIEWERS: 527
[2022-12-27 03:49:24] <%AmaraPeach> it wouldn't matter if the wasn't different weight
[2022-12-27 03:49:26] <+rdschmid> that probably^4....is the chance of that occurance
[2022-12-27 03:49:41] <%PaneHS> its diferent if you are pulling 4 trinkets and they are all cat and if you are pulling 10 and there is a spree of 4 cats
[2022-12-27 03:49:53] <%+sarcastic_minion> 8% doesnt include the other variables...if the other variables are includd it might be something other than 8
[2022-12-27 03:49:59] <+rdschmid> @PaneHS in a sample size of 4, 4 cats is 0.004%
[2022-12-27 03:50:00] <untruthfully> the math is more complicated if the other things didnt happen but the fact that this specific occurance happened is indeed 1 in 25000
[2022-12-27 03:50:03] <!%KaptainWutax> Any other trinket repeating in the sequence would have caused the same reaction in fact. That's p-hacking. Then you need to account for the selection biases, the sequence could have occurred any time throughout the season so you can't just look at the last 4.
[2022-12-27 03:50:04] <untruthfully> smth like that
[2022-12-27 03:51:14] <+rdschmid> @KaptainWutax thats a rationalization of the probability.  The fact remains that the snapshot of highly unlikely rates is odd.  Sure in the larger sample it can average, but thats just law of large numbers
[2022-12-27 03:51:21] <%+r0cketsaws> the math isn't more complicated.  It's bad odds period.  But, that's the funny thing about statistics.  How can you tell if it's not random?
[2022-12-27 03:51:21] <Megaking202> but you can BibleThump
[2022-12-27 03:51:22] <+caraamelie> @abe you have to divide by the number of rearrangements of all the trinkets you've rolled

[2022-12-27 03:51:38] <untruthfully> isnt that the same issue that dream had to deal with?
[2022-12-27 03:51:45] <!%KaptainWutax> No it is not. Getting 6 heads in a row is unlikely, but it's not unlikely to find a sequence of 6 heads after rolling 100 dice.

[2022-12-27 03:52:44] <%PaneHS> the server rolled around 50 trinkets

[2022-12-27 03:53:15] <!%KaptainWutax> I doubt it's that bad if you account for that, p-hacking and possibly a stopping criterion but I haven't done the math

[2022-12-27 04:02:43] <Megaking202> He didn't stop, he didn't have more Kappa

[2022-12-27 04:02:46] <%KiiWiiiii> @RoseSebastian expected odds can be used when its a specific set, not when talking about overal odds, because then you would have to calculate ALL the rolls you havent dont yet too i think

[2022-12-27 06:15:11] <%WilliCookie> It still kept the epic chest glow tho
[2022-12-27 06:15:23] <%LaLaBriar> it could be possible since the item isn't in the loot table
