[2022-12-29 16:49:25] <Kagumiiin> did you get a 5*
[2022-12-29 16:49:36] <@%Mikulex> Honeymoon phase all over again
[2022-12-29 16:49:46] <@%Mikulex> Never lucky this time
[2022-12-29 16:49:53] <@%Mikulex> Got Bennet at least
[2022-12-29 16:50:41] <@%Mikulex> Is it worth to dump primos already on raiden
[2022-12-29 16:50:45] <Kagumiiin> yea
[2022-12-29 16:50:58] <Kagumiiin> she wont be back for 6months least
[2022-12-29 16:51:17] <Kagumiiin> plus she has low entery need teams now
[2022-12-29 16:51:58] <Kagumiiin> but note that
[2022-12-29 16:52:01] <Kagumiiin> alhaitham xiao next
[2022-12-29 16:52:06] <Kagumiiin> and probably yelan hutao after
[2022-12-29 16:53:45] <@%Mikulex> Do you look for optimal builds or just pull for waifu
[2022-12-29 16:55:19] <Kagumiiin> depends
[2022-12-29 16:55:35] <Kagumiiin> goodwaifu > build > waifu
[2022-12-29 16:55:46] <Kagumiiin> but now I have enough good waifus to just pull waifus
[2022-12-29 16:55:46] <@%Mikulex> Raiden seems fun and looks great so I'm just gonna pull lolr
[2022-12-29 16:56:05] <@%Mikulex> Left my luck on na tho
[2022-12-29 16:56:56] <Kagumiiin> 75 onwards is a 1/4 chance of a 5 stat
[2022-12-29 16:56:58] <Kagumiiin> star
[2022-12-29 16:57:02] <Kagumiiin> but now you are on a 5050
[2022-12-29 16:57:22] <@%Mikulex> Got kujou Sara twice in the same pull lole
[2022-12-29 16:57:34] <Kagumiiin> mustirLevel
[2022-12-29 16:57:49] <Kagumiiin> I still dont have her
[2022-12-29 16:57:57] <Kagumiiin> she and sucrose
[2022-12-29 16:58:06] <@%Mikulex> are kujou and rosaria great
[2022-12-29 16:58:06] <Kagumiiin> getting unlucky on their every banner
[2022-12-29 16:58:10] <@%Mikulex> cause i got rosaria too
[2022-12-29 16:58:21] <Kagumiiin> for your level everyone is fine
[2022-12-29 16:58:30] <Kagumiiin> late game they have their teams
[2022-12-29 16:59:19] <@%Mikulex> rosaria has fishnet tights so shes S tier anyways
[2022-12-29 16:59:23] <Kagumiiin> sara buffs electro dpses
[2022-12-29 16:59:41] <Kagumiiin> rosaria gives crit rate for her team but not useful rn
[2022-12-29 16:59:46] <Kagumiiin> true
[2022-12-29 16:59:52] <Kagumiiin> mustirEat
[2022-12-29 17:01:52] <@%Mikulex> Guess late game builds are one thing, still gonna try out how fun gameplay in general is
[2022-12-29 17:09:59] <@%Mikulex> sara only buffs elecro dmg and not atk in general?
[2022-12-29 17:14:08] <Kagumiiin> I need to confirm
[2022-12-29 17:15:07] <Kagumiiin> oh yeah btw you can get collei (and xiangling I think) from clearing floor 4 (and 3 ) abyss
[2022-12-29 17:17:20] <@%Mikulex> Was too lazy to do so yet
[2022-12-29 17:17:41] <@%Mikulex> Xiangling definitely, but collei too?
[2022-12-29 17:17:47] <Kagumiiin> yea
[2022-12-29 17:20:34] <@%Mikulex> I likes xiangling and so far rosaria seems fun too
[2022-12-29 17:20:46] <@%Mikulex> Maybe I have a thing for spear wielders
[2022-12-29 17:21:46] <Kagumiiin> excellent choices mustirLevel
[2022-12-29 17:21:56] <Kagumiiin> hutao is also uses spear
[2022-12-29 17:21:58] <Kagumiiin> a
[2022-12-29 17:22:19] <@%Mikulex> poggers
[2022-12-29 17:22:34] <Kagumiiin> with how much content is infront of you
[2022-12-29 17:22:41] <Kagumiiin> if you dont get raiden you can guarantee hutao
[2022-12-29 17:23:08] <Kagumiiin> even if you get her you can guarantee tbgh
[2022-12-29 17:23:58] <@%Mikulex> first i have to continue to play genshin after christmas break is over lole
[2022-12-29 17:24:08] <Kagumiiin> aware
[2022-12-29 17:24:23] <@%Mikulex> but chances should be better now that i dont have to learn for any big certs for now
[2022-12-29 17:37:28] <Kagumiiin> did you pass your certs?
[2022-12-29 17:38:15] <Kagumiiin> (yea c0 sara increases atk)
