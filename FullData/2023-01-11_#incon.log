[2023-01-11 00:52:34] <%+voyage_icarus> I’ve been playing smite, with breaks, since 2013. The amount of items is still sometimes overwhelming for me
[2023-01-11 00:52:57] <tayy_o> @voyage_icarus most of them are not viable and its been that way for a long time
[2023-01-11 00:52:59] <%+voyage_icarus> Especially roles I don’t play often
[2023-01-11 00:53:09] <tayy_o> that should make it less overwhelming
[2023-01-11 00:54:04] <%+voyage_icarus> Meta changes more or less every patch. + some non-meta items are great situational picks or great on certain characters
[2023-01-11 00:54:22] VIEWERS: 974
[2023-01-11 00:55:19] <%+voyage_icarus> + a huge portion of the game is played before builds really form anyway, so if you’re really skilled, your build really only matters late game
