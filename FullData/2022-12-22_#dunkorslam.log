[2022-12-22 05:50:42] <%$myndzi> while waiting for stream you can watch me take an L lol https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/674081854629871636/1055338374002647070/tgm1_big_948.mp4
[2022-12-22 05:50:54] <%$myndzi> i was honestly super nervous, game went so well, then threw due to nerves :(
[2022-12-22 05:51:10] <%$myndzi> like 15-20 more pieces and i'd have won
[2022-12-22 05:51:23] <%$myndzi> be like the 6th person known to do it - though it wouldn't count 'cause this is clone game
[2022-12-22 05:52:03] <%$myndzi> eh, it doesn't open in browser, i guess i'll go paste in discord
[2022-12-22 05:53:53] <%$myndzi> i should stop joining the discord just to paste shit in chase check this lmao, but sometimes i can't resist
[2022-12-22 05:54:13] <baehjer57> tetris huh?
[2022-12-22 05:54:30] <baehjer57> best game ever
[2022-12-22 05:54:36] <%$myndzi> yessir, specifically TGM (1, in this case)
[2022-12-22 05:54:43] <%+dusty_sprinkles> why don't you just like, stay in it

[2022-12-22 05:56:30] <%$myndzi> go stock market
[2022-12-22 05:56:53] <%dragooniez> damn, so close @myndzi
[2022-12-22 05:57:09] <%$myndzi> yeah :( kinda glad i missed though, 'cause it wouldn't have counted
[2022-12-22 05:57:19] <%$myndzi> i was just practicing 20g on the laptop and had a really good game
[2022-12-22 05:57:28] <%dragooniez> oh yeah, it not counting would have felt worse for sure
[2022-12-22 05:57:33] <%$myndzi> you only have to play 20g like this for _half_ the game, so it bodes well

[2022-12-22 07:17:20] <%WUOTE> !citb
[2022-12-22 07:17:20] <@^Nightbot> CITBs: The science of understanding, deconstructing, and reconstructing Bet Runs. However, Chase is not a master of video games. It is impossible for him to hold his desire to throw. If one wishes to obtain a CITB, one must vote correctly 7 times in a row. This is the law of Chase In The Banks™; the trophies of the Moist Mob. In accordance to this law, there is a taboo for Chase. During bets, looking at chat is strictly forbidden. For what could equal his wrath at everyone voting !no on TI Runs
[2022-12-22 07:17:20] <Naicii> Tbh the fastest way to farm most things in the game is to pop a zerg potion and farm

[2022-12-22 08:02:11] <%qirbeee> I logged over 1000 hours on that sheeeet
[2022-12-22 08:02:23] <%shamwhoa> Gearbox owns the IP now
[2022-12-22 08:02:29] <Vexilus_> Same with other Battle Royales, if you're by yourself it's just an instant loss if you run into a group. unless you just skill gap them
[2022-12-22 08:02:31] <%+derhoce> !yes
[2022-12-22 08:02:36] <%Letaali> Hopoo sold the IP to gearbox already. This is just a passion project from Hopoo
[2022-12-22 08:02:36] <%Crysyn> The Risk of Rain remake is having RoR2 content back ported to it and a whole new set of things being added to all of existing RoR1 content
[2022-12-22 08:02:37] <embrs> @shamwhoa, fire ukko... can be shortened to f-ukko
[2022-12-22 08:02:38] <%ItsTheFrank> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyXNUXEfNvc
[2022-12-22 08:02:39] <%nolava> Lots of people prefer the style of RoR 1
[2022-12-22 08:02:40] <%Ephemeris__> ROR1 was great
[2022-12-22 08:02:43] <llpineapplell> Dark and Darker also has the battle royale shrinking zone so the pacing is much quicker than Tarkov
[2022-12-22 08:02:44] <abstrd> hotpoo
[2022-12-22 08:02:44] <%Letaali> gearbox will own this remake too
[2022-12-22 08:02:47] <%Crysyn> Its basically RoR1 + Ror2 = Re-RoR
[2022-12-22 08:02:48] <%Viddaric> RoR1 was frustrating
[2022-12-22 08:02:48] <%+RNGrizzly> It's a remaster and update, adding items from RoR2, new classes, updated pixel art
[2022-12-22 08:02:50] <%tealisu> ROR1 IS SUPER GOOD
[2022-12-22 08:02:55] <%qirbeee> @q_z__ I never played Hades but I have heard really good thingz. apparently very lore accurate
[2022-12-22 08:02:56] <%scobunk> @DunkOrSlam can you add your latest death to !death :)
[2022-12-22 08:03:00] <%Ephemeris__> Awesome news >:
[2022-12-22 08:03:01] <%Letaali> but Hopoo is developing it and Chris comes back to make some new music for it
[2022-12-22 08:03:04] <%Crysyn> Also, Risk of rain 1 iS MUCH MUCH MUCH harder than Risk of Rain 2

[2022-12-22 08:03:09] <%Dr_h0nK> KEKW
[2022-12-22 08:03:11] <%Ephemeris__> :) *
[2022-12-22 08:03:19] <%Letaali> it might be the last music in this game series we hear from Chris, I am excited
[2022-12-22 08:03:20] <%+duke1102> NOITA 2.0 WHEN
[2022-12-22 08:03:27] <%q_z__> @Crysyn (looks away in artifact of glass)
[2022-12-22 08:03:31] <%qirbeee> risk of rain 2 is basically 3D for 1 buttttt Dussy RoR 1 has great content unavailable in 2
[2022-12-22 08:03:32] <%scobunk> i would disagree
[2022-12-22 08:03:35] <%Letaali> yes
[2022-12-22 08:03:36] <Naicii> Yes
[2022-12-22 08:03:37] <%tealisu> it is
[2022-12-22 08:03:38] <%q_z__> yes
[2022-12-22 08:03:39] <Naicii> Risk of bad netcode
[2022-12-22 08:03:39] <%Crysyn> Yes
[2022-12-22 08:03:41] <%dragooniez> i loved RoR 1,
[2022-12-22 08:03:45] <%Crysyn> Its 2D and a pain in the ass
[2022-12-22 08:03:45] <noahboddie> There is, but it sucks
[2022-12-22 08:03:46] <%+Omnipotent_0> Way better with friends
[2022-12-22 08:03:47] <%ItsTheFrank> its not worth tho
[2022-12-22 08:03:48] <%q_z__> Pog
[2022-12-22 08:03:50] <%Crysyn> I hated Risk or Rain 1
[2022-12-22 08:03:52] <%Letaali> they are remaking it
[2022-12-22 08:03:53] <%dragooniez> that pixel art was fun as heck
[2022-12-22 08:03:54] <%Crysyn> RoR2 is Epic
[2022-12-22 08:03:54] <%q_z__> it will be fixed
[2022-12-22 08:03:59] <%C1ic> ror1 is definitely not harder that ror2
[2022-12-22 08:04:02] <%+Omnipotent_0> If your friends are good it can be fun xD

[2022-12-22 08:04:19] <%Crysyn> Significantly harder than RoR2
[2022-12-22 08:04:19] <%scobunk> unless you get overloading worms :)
[2022-12-22 08:04:19] <%Detuskified_Walrus> they are both good games lol
[2022-12-22 08:04:24] <%qirbeee> @nolava fsssss
[2022-12-22 08:04:30] <Betelgeussse> Dark and Darker looks more PvE oriented than tarkov. There are more tougher enemies etc
[2022-12-22 08:04:31] <%JohnnyNineTW> Risk of Rain 1 is super hard getting started, but once you figure it out, it becomes pretty easy
[2022-12-22 08:04:31] <%WaxNumen> Are you contemplating playing other new games when you have several on your plate already Susge
[2022-12-22 08:04:36] <Naicii> RoR1 is way harder* depending on artifacts or not
[2022-12-22 08:04:42] <%huskiterian> If you think 2d games are harder, ROR1 is harder, opposite if you think 3d games are harder.

[2022-12-22 08:04:58] <%Viddaric> Huntress in RoR2 is hard mode. Huntress in RoR1 is easy mode.
[2022-12-22 08:04:59] <%Letaali> ror2 is a completely different game when you play alone

[2022-12-22 08:07:42] <war_trained_bear> Once upon a time, in the magical world of Noita, there was a young wizard who was on a quest to become the greatest magician the world had ever known.  As the wizard traveled through the treacherous caves and forests of Noita, he encountered all sorts of dangers and challenges. He fought off fierce monsters, braved treacherous traps, and discovered ancient relics and powerful spells.  But no matter how great the danger, the wizard remained determined and brave. He knew that he had to continue on

As he journeyed deeper into the heart of Noita, the wizard encountered a powerful and ancient evil that threatened to destroy the world. But the wizard was not afraid. He drew upon all of his strength and magic, and using all of his cunning and bravery, he was able to defeat the evil and save the world from destruction.  And so, the wizard returned home a hero, hailed by all as the greatest magician the world had ever known. From that day on,

[2022-12-22 08:34:49] <+TehUltraViolence> The biggest problem I can see is that the engine has to be fully deterministic and then signal the intents of each player to each other. Or you need basically one host and one streamer.

[2022-12-22 08:40:23] <%+duke1102> @DunkOrSlam So, @Soler is playing Skyrim and has this mod which makes wild animals more deadly. Yesterday he first encountered a brown bear, then sneaked around that sucker after it one hit him, then he met a sabretooth tiger, even worse. Then somehow those two met up and the brown bear was destroyed by the tiger.

[2022-12-22 08:42:40] <%+duke1102> @DunkOrSlam Also there was this one moment where this cute snow fox or rabbit (or something) was and it was like moving towards @Soler and right in that moment the music went into a perfect "tension" stinger moment, Soler was scared that cute guy would maul him.
[2022-12-22 08:42:41] <%683552ccae99> @lip_hooder It's called TI

[2022-12-22 09:31:19] <%WaxNumen> @qirbeee YEP
[2022-12-22 09:31:22] <%war_trained_bear> @qirbeee heal damage is its own type
[2022-12-22 09:31:33] <de_ffy> its a bit lower than where you entered
[2022-12-22 09:31:41] <%qirbeee> so ambrosia doesnt block damage, just positive damage?
[2022-12-22 09:31:47] <de_ffy> its in an area where a lot of acid shrooms were
[2022-12-22 09:31:49] <%war_trained_bear> it is technically negative damage but it's its own damage type
[2022-12-22 09:31:56] <%+RoyalJamMix> isn't gold pointlesss?
[2022-12-22 09:32:00] <%qirbeee> @war_trained_bear HMMM dnkNoted
[2022-12-22 09:32:08] <%WaxNumen> @qirbeee It blocks all damage except heal damage, yeah. Negative damage is a misnomer
[2022-12-22 09:32:09] <de_ffy> @RoyalJamMix there are still shops around the areas
[2022-12-22 09:32:10] <%war_trained_bear> @RoyalJamMix spell shops
[2022-12-22 09:32:12] <%+dusty_sprinkles> Healing isn't "Damage" damage, it would probably still block negative damage from actual damage sources I think

[2022-12-22 11:50:51] <+Pandafailed> @dunkorslam its been done before. wildstar was made by a bunch of former bliz devs and had some neat skillshot based ability targeting, base building, and a well put together world with world events. it flopped and died after a few years :(

[2022-12-22 11:51:38] <+DrMosi1> Cheer100 I went to the Ancient Lab yesterday for the first time, and man i got nuked by this mage without even seeing him
[2022-12-22 11:51:54] <%Larandar> I never remember, dmg field is player owned?
[2022-12-22 11:51:54] <%Nifty255> Dunk, IMO Final Fantasy XIV is juuuust barely different enough from standard MMOs to warrant a look. Sure, the combat is still hotbar-based, but at later levels, it feels much better than the likes of WoW. And there's innovation in other areas such as the fashion and housing systems. Even if all of that were the same as WoW though, I'd still recommend it because of the amazing story past the base game.

[2022-12-22 11:53:00] <%breaketh1> FFXIV wa more of a single player game with touches of MMO. really dont think they did much outside of the box.
[2022-12-22 11:53:06] <$DrMosi1> Wasnt really a nuke, more a huge ass fireball

[2022-12-22 12:11:18] <@^Nightbot> CITBs: The science of understanding, deconstructing, and reconstructing Bet Runs. However, Chase is not a master of video games. It is impossible for him to hold his desire to throw. If one wishes to obtain a CITB, one must vote correctly 7 times in a row. This is the law of Chase In The Banks™; the trophies of the Moist Mob. In accordance to this law, there is a taboo for Chase. During bets, looking at chat is strictly forbidden. For what could equal his wrath at everyone voting !no on TI Runs

[2022-12-22 12:41:46] <%breaketh1> @DunkOrSlam how long are you going to throw on purpose so you dont get wins...
[2022-12-22 12:41:48] <%683552ccae99> Nolla could easily charge another $20 for a new patch with an expanded map, bosses, etc. And easier to do than a whole new game
[2022-12-22 12:41:48] <%Larandar> @iRage2Win That's a different question...

[2022-12-22 12:42:03] <%WaxNumen> @iRage2Win Yeah, it's a pretty funny game. I think it's one of the few that would be better for Dunk with minimal backseating, however
[2022-12-22 12:42:06] <%Larandar> @iRage2Win A very HARD question...
[2022-12-22 12:42:08] <%+iRage2Win> @iRage2Win LUL this is dunk we are talking about
[2022-12-22 12:42:08] <%Soler> then something might be wrong, try adding a new match and deleting it from a word
[2022-12-22 12:42:10] <%kuuucki> This is the mod where Dunk rants himself to death Kappa
