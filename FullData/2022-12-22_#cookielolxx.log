[2022-12-22 16:09:37] <MrGoodQuestions> personally ... i love shilling
[2022-12-22 16:10:00] <MalarSYN> @simonkv3 yeah in those kinda situations if you can afford it get some defensive items like randuins or anathema's just so you can survive against her long enough to run

[2022-12-22 16:10:38] <simonkv3> @MalarSYN good idea, but is it ok to buy def items as third item?
[2022-12-22 16:11:06] <MalarSYN> @simonkv3 no I'm pretty sure you always wanna get IE/Navori its a really big spike not worth delaying
[2022-12-22 16:11:11] <@%dimixmt> @simonkv3 It's not bad but it's better to get it 4th honestly
[2022-12-22 16:11:23] <aca_11253> cookie i just picked up aphelios i die way too much how can i fix that?
[2022-12-22 16:11:28] <@%dimixmt> Cuz like sure you will survive longer but you won't kill her faster

[2022-12-22 16:11:43] <MalarSYN> At that point just play tank lmao
[2022-12-22 16:11:46] <simonkv3> Def item as 4th item might have helped alot, i kinda always wait for defensive items as 6th item:/

[2022-12-22 16:28:16] <MalarSYN> Nasus W is so polarizing its either super op or basically useless
[2022-12-22 16:28:17] <bullet0909> nasus should get entirely reworked, he has no spot in the game right now because its faster paced and so they compensate that by making him giga broken late
[2022-12-22 16:28:21] <+SaVaGeBritt03> it should scale off of bonus HP, not flat rates
[2022-12-22 16:28:21] <alexxbap444> outplayed honestly
[2022-12-22 16:28:21] <hudebniik> More dmg, less W AS debuff in my opinion

[2022-12-22 18:57:33] <jazziboy_> jaksho gives like 500 armor
[2022-12-22 18:57:33] <%sawnikas> only 1 choice for having the damage is to buy kraken slayer Kappa

[2022-12-22 18:57:55] <%+Blenburner> I guess you need more pen no? You may have 1 pen item but I don't think that should be enough for someone who has three armor items

[2022-12-22 19:42:41] <CoachYukiKumo> @ebyen_hatic go into practice tool lock your xp and with no items just go to one of the lanes and practice last hitting, its will help your game play a lot the more farm you have the more gold you have the more items you and the more damage you do so practicing cs-ing is VERY important
[2022-12-22 19:42:52] <%+bacens> @ebyen_hatic nah, but make sure u mute all, there is a lot of smurfs on new accounts that dont understand that someone can be really new at the game and learning
