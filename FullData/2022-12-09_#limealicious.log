[2022-12-09 00:24:23] <%AK_Zephyr> @Wayback2k you can setup individual tomb zones and it'll work without a room
[2022-12-09 00:24:30] <Wayback2k> slabs and memories are better since they have comments
[2022-12-09 00:24:32] <+InducesPanic> Could you play this game on a Steam Deck? Or does it basically require a mouse & keyboard?

[2022-12-09 00:24:43] <digitaladam123> you are good to just fill that room with coffins
[2022-12-09 00:24:43] <%FourtyTwo424242> @InducesPanic you need a keyboard
[2022-12-09 00:24:44] <bayronbunbun> you could always make it one level below
[2022-12-09 00:24:45] <%AK_Zephyr> so 1x1 tomb zone with a single coffin in it
[2022-12-09 00:24:46] <Wayback2k> @AK_Zephyr did that change? i was getting yelled at for no doors last time i tried
[2022-12-09 00:24:47] <Twichty> they patched the atom smasher?
[2022-12-09 00:24:48] <%bunglinglummox> if you just contruct coffins (and "build" them like furniture) you don't need to make them rooms
[2022-12-09 00:24:56] <@%Greygull> You do not need a keyboard to play this

[2022-12-09 00:25:04] <@%Greygull> You can play it on Steam Deck, but it probably won't be the best experience.
[2022-12-09 00:25:09] <%zman12380> from what people said here you can make several zones in the same room and it would be alright for the individual tombs clause
[2022-12-09 00:25:10] <@%Greygull> But people have already verified it's functional on Steam Deck.
[2022-12-09 00:25:15] <%scrimbingus> The zone can be a single tile
[2022-12-09 00:25:20] <%AK_Zephyr> @Wayback2k if you put a single zone over a bunch of coffins they'll only be assign to one dwarf

[2022-12-09 00:25:41] <%zman12380> You just need to make zones, not rooms for each oen

[2022-12-09 02:40:32] <%$SanicDaHedgehag> Yeah, they kinda botched the storytelling
[2022-12-09 02:40:32] <huesodemar> @Limealicious Destiny is like a game you see in a movie that they use to make the nerd look like he's playing games
[2022-12-09 02:40:32] <%thatcrazycrabs> Oh Destiny?
[2022-12-09 02:40:32] <%Ero_Jiraiya> maybe destiny 3 will be better

[2022-12-09 02:40:44] <VelstadtTheRoyalAnus> Why is it every video game has their music and sound effects replaced with wub wub noises

[2022-12-09 03:14:44] <iglopop> yeah Elden ring is cool but narrative it wont win

[2022-12-09 03:14:47] <SamTheMarioMan> I wonder if God of War will win more awards tonight!
[2022-12-09 03:14:47] <+ShroomMage> "Best Lore" could be a category
[2022-12-09 03:14:47] <%thatcrazycrabs> I mean, I can see why personally but eh
[2022-12-09 03:14:47] <slackerunchained> Time for 15 more minutes of speech from Mr. judge. :)

[2022-12-09 03:14:53] <+HunterMasashi> yeah elden ring in the narrative category is a weird choice
[2022-12-09 03:14:54] <%Lorothol> Elden Ring could barely even implement the "story" outline

[2022-12-09 03:55:13] <%FourtyTwo424242> New world had no story which killed it
[2022-12-09 03:55:16] <jnerdlin> New World still exists, people still play it, the streamers just stopped... streaming it probably cuz they reached the end of their sponorships
[2022-12-09 03:55:21] <%Lt_Shadow> reminds me of RWBY
[2022-12-09 03:55:22] <%+BroMagnon> @Laimubot keep trying laimubot
[2022-12-09 03:55:22] <FreakBurgerr> looks neat but also so generic
[2022-12-09 03:55:24] <%+piritomoe> games are so good at anime artstyles nowadays
[2022-12-09 03:55:29] <VelstadtTheRoyalAnus> Why do even the video game SOUND EFFECTS have to sound like dubstep now??!
[2022-12-09 03:55:30] <%Charronia> It had also had arbitrary code execution exploits, so it's for the best that it shut down

[2022-12-09 04:43:00] <%+piritomoe> they needed famous actor (TM) to voice mario for clout
[2022-12-09 04:43:00] <@%TheLawlDawg> Mario is literally just Chris Pratt
[2022-12-09 04:43:00] <MahouSloth> beecause luigi has anxiety

[2022-12-09 04:43:13] <Shinsua> Mario will get cracked in the head midway through the movie and then he'll start talking like how he's supposed to
[2022-12-09 04:43:15] <%FourtyTwo424242> in theory chris pratt suppose to sell tickets, but this is 2022 now and no one cares about actors

[2022-12-09 04:43:19] <klayton230> Crisp Ratt on the other hand is just...
[2022-12-09 04:43:22] <Rawrthernlion> The french mario sounds like mario without sounding grating at all
[2022-12-09 04:43:22] <%+MoltenMermaid> I like Charlie day. Don't think he's a good Luigi, but I'm gonna like it because I like Charlie Day?
[2022-12-09 04:43:24] <!%Laimubot> Is it just renew the timer in the day skyrim released
[2022-12-09 04:43:25] <!%hackerling> it hurts my body every time i hear it, not just for performance reasons
[2022-12-09 04:43:25] <@%TheLawlDawg> Charlie Day as Luigi is actually a funny cast that works
[2022-12-09 04:43:26] <%+piritomoe> that's bs, martinet can absolutely tone down the mario voice

[2022-12-09 21:54:41] <+LordPsi99> I'm feeling particularly sour about the Dragon Quest series because I feel Yuji Naka was baited by Square Enix because they didn't like his opinions after he vented about the Balan situation.

[2022-12-09 22:08:44] <+LordPsi99> But isn't it only bad if you sell the stock after the announcement? Can't one become a share holder to help a small business that needs investment? Like, I agree that manipulating stock price and profiting from it is bad and should remain illegal. But for the Yuji Naka situation, I feel like he should just get refunded exact amount he put in without profit, not arrested. That's just my opinion, though. I feel that short selling should get people arrested.

My friend asked me how I was going and I was just answering them and I got timed out for a day. I had to take a hiatus from Twitch for a year after that. FeelsBadMan

[2022-12-09 22:42:50] <Princlet> @DesertP Xenoblade not even winning best music was kind of messed up imo.

[2022-12-09 22:42:57] <%+Kippeves> I mean, BOTW was a good Zelda-game
[2022-12-09 22:42:59] <%KnuxTenma> As I keep seeing: I look forward to whatever game releases the same week as Horizon Three limesGiggle
[2022-12-09 22:43:04] <%+Kippeves> but Horizon Zero Dawn was a better game
[2022-12-09 22:43:07] <%+SilverDevilfish> Don't feel bad Zero Dawn sold over 20 million units. The "it sold bad" thing is a gamer myth.
[2022-12-09 22:43:12] <DesertP> metal hellsinger has a lot of really good musicians in it
[2022-12-09 22:43:18] <DesertP> its a very good game
[2022-12-09 22:43:20] <+Mario1080p> Xenoblade being part of the medley which in turn featured the flute guy I consider an absolute win

[2022-12-09 22:44:07] <DesertP> can we all agree that the real best music award should have gone to flute guy
[2022-12-09 22:44:09] <Princlet> Metal Hellsinger is legit indeed. Ragnarok was honestly one of the weakest entries in the music category I think. Music isn't really what makes that game stand out. To me anyway.
