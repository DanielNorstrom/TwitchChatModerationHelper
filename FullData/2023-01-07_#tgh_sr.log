[2023-01-07 11:52:34] <+Zarrokz> i definitely click on streams to see what they are doing and immediately leave if prerolls for 2mins hit
[2023-01-07 11:52:40] <+DruuChee> i swear i never get ads on desktop. pog im from cali n i watch lots of canada guys. n no ads im lucky.
[2023-01-07 11:52:47] <+celadxn> personally i think if you watch twitch a lot that buying twitch turbo is amazing

[2023-01-07 11:53:32] <Nyancy_Cat> fire spin
[2023-01-07 11:53:43] <+celadxn> turbo is 9$(?) a month but it’s no ads across the whole website
[2023-01-07 11:53:44] <@%Iceblue> 8.99 a month
[2023-01-07 11:53:45] <sumphatguy> its 98 bucks
[2023-01-07 11:53:46] <@%CarloBrown> $8.99 turbo is still I think
[2023-01-07 11:53:49] <sumphatguy> 9*
[2023-01-07 11:54:04] <@%AmberCyprian> Yeah I dropped all my subs for turbo and for 9 bucks a month, and I have no regrets.
[2023-01-07 11:54:19] <+DruuChee> i dont even get prerolls lol. just mobile its ads all day

[2023-01-07 11:54:35] <+michaelchany> this is my first month with Turbo and it feels like an almost different experience.
[2023-01-07 11:54:35] <@%^Nightbot> tghThis is my first month with Turbo and it feels like an almost different experience.
[2023-01-07 11:54:39] <Rasschla> I mean, you're honest that it improves the channel and you giving the option to make a living out of it. You also have streamers who claim it's just for keeping the pre-roll away.
[2023-01-07 11:55:01] <%maleblackfiora> best part of turbo is all free on all devices
[2023-01-07 11:55:05] <%KweenChi> i still don't get turbo
[2023-01-07 11:55:09] <%maleblackfiora> ad free
[2023-01-07 11:55:17] <%KweenChi> how's it diff from subs
[2023-01-07 11:55:22] <+celadxn> turbo is like having a sub to every channel without the emotes
[2023-01-07 11:55:23] <@%AmberCyprian> For some streamers, ads *aren't* super profitable and they want to keep pre-rolls away as pre-rolls hurt growth a lot.
[2023-01-07 11:55:38] <%M000GLE> You get 0 ads on the entire site @KweenChi
[2023-01-07 11:55:39] <@%CarloBrown> turbo is ad free site wide, subs is just the channel you sub too

[2023-01-07 11:57:18] <Ionic_Iris> Yeah it's been a long time since I had the option to set a custom name color
[2023-01-07 11:57:28] <+celadxn> turbo name color is set forever until you change ot
[2023-01-07 11:57:31] <+celadxn> it*
[2023-01-07 11:57:44] <@%CarloBrown> yeah I set mine with turbo a long time ago
[2023-01-07 11:57:51] <Ionic_Iris> Prime had that option too at one point
[2023-01-07 11:57:55] <%KweenChi> when do you guys think that turbo's more worth it than a sub?
[2023-01-07 11:57:57] <+celadxn> i miss twitch prime coming with turbo
[2023-01-07 11:57:58] <Ionic_Iris> That's how I changed mine

[2023-01-07 15:17:40] <jpcicno6> fakeout?
[2023-01-07 15:17:51] <meteneisenvidia> horn :3
[2023-01-07 15:17:52] <%Taillow> Crunch or shadow punch?
[2023-01-07 15:17:59] <@%fsvgm777> !backseat
[2023-01-07 15:17:59] <karharias> this heracross spread is strait crap LUL
[2023-01-07 15:17:59] <@%^Nightbot> Do NOT provide help, ideas, or advice. Do not spoil the story. Violators are subject to a time-out. Feel free to discuss this game (story, mechanics, game progression) WITH SPOILER TAGS in Teej's discord!
[2023-01-07 15:18:00] <@%^Nightbot> tghThis heracross spread is strait crap LUL
[2023-01-07 15:18:07] <AmeSoso> Why keep Fake Out
[2023-01-07 15:18:07] <%Taillow> Dark and ghost cover most of the same things.
[2023-01-07 15:18:21] <%Fio_Hart> free chip damage
[2023-01-07 15:18:22] <Nyancy_Cat> crunch covers everything punch does
[2023-01-07 15:18:25] <anotherpangolin> shame the stats lean spa instead of atk, this moveset seems really good
[2023-01-07 15:18:42] <%Taillow> Yeah, definitely fair.
[2023-01-07 15:18:50] <%+Pyron18> this is a mon of all time
[2023-01-07 15:18:50] <@%^Nightbot> tghThis is a mon of all time
[2023-01-07 15:19:01] <%+OnlyShorts> Do you plan on running it?
[2023-01-07 15:19:17] <%+OnlyShorts> tghSip
[2023-01-07 15:19:23] <%2pert> Its got a solid moveset and stats now that leveled up doesnt look so iffy
[2023-01-07 15:19:27] <%Taillow> I like fake out but I treat it solely as utility.
[2023-01-07 15:19:29] VIEWERS: 731
[2023-01-07 15:19:48] <%$ShenkBros> I mean fake out is free damage, but it doesn't scale great when compared to other options
[2023-01-07 15:20:13] <AmeSoso> Fake Out just takes a slot for noting in important fights with 5-6 mons
[2023-01-07 15:20:48] <+LustfulMirage> what happened to the blaziken?
[2023-01-07 15:20:57] <pfiesteria> Is there a spreadsheet? For all recorded wins?
[2023-01-07 15:21:01] <%2pert> In a world where you want to be 1 tapping mons fake out does very little in the long run
[2023-01-07 15:21:03] <%Taillow> Yeah, fair in an ironmon scenario
[2023-01-07 15:21:18] <Nyancy_Cat> why do you never go through the grass to dodge her?
[2023-01-07 15:21:28] <%+OnlyShorts> My issue with Fake Out is that its contact
[2023-01-07 15:21:29] VIEWERS: 731
[2023-01-07 15:21:48] <AmeSoso> yeah you just risk contact for chip damage
[2023-01-07 15:21:53] <AngelsBioTech> is there hm friends in this kaizo too? i know there in fire red but here there extra hm so how its work here
[2023-01-07 15:22:07] <%Taillow> Huh, didn't know it was contact. Or forgot.
[2023-01-07 15:22:36] <ocran_> As randy Jackson would say, It’s gonna be a no from me, dawg
[2023-01-07 15:22:39] <%+OnlyShorts> I had an 180 ATK Blissey with Fake-out, I admit that was fun
[2023-01-07 15:22:42] <%+Pyron18> @AngelsBioTech we need two HM friends sadly
[2023-01-07 15:22:52] <%2pert> There is a chance where you learn nothing else and the moveset is still really solid
[2023-01-07 15:22:52] <@%^Nightbot> tghThis 👉 🗺️
[2023-01-07 15:23:01] <karharias> in other games that physical and special are different, are contact moves changed?
[2023-01-07 15:23:16] <Nyancy_Cat> mostly no
[2023-01-07 15:23:25] <%+Pyron18> @karharias most contact moves are physical from Gen 4 onwards
[2023-01-07 15:23:28] <+Figeroux> that mon is a bit of a tank

[2023-01-07 15:23:36] <jpcicno6> no way gets past roxanne right?
[2023-01-07 15:23:38] <AmeSoso> @OnlyShorts I had a normal type with Technician and Fake out in gen 4 reimiLul that was very fun too but I still got rid of it
[2023-01-07 15:23:53] <anotherpangolin> no
[2023-01-07 15:24:01] <Nyancy_Cat> triple shed coverage lol
[2023-01-07 15:24:12] <%2pert> I mean, special attack doesnt look that bad as it looked like early on
[2023-01-07 15:24:13] <%$ShenkBros> but you know what that means, it's gonna tragically die to something bullshit
[2023-01-07 15:24:51] <anotherpangolin> only big downside seems to be the inevitable death to a fast flying move
[2023-01-07 15:25:03] <%+Pyron18> accounting for all pokemon there are only 5 that resist the full moveset and they are all steels lol
[2023-01-07 15:25:03] <%$thepurplekitty> !bullshi
[2023-01-07 15:25:03] <%firin_bot> Yeah, it has no poopasnoops

[2023-01-07 15:25:36] <%+Pyron18> it's just magnets, Skarmory, Mawile, and Registeel that resist this moveset
[2023-01-07 15:25:36] <@%CarloBrown> tghThink
[2023-01-07 15:25:51] <anotherpangolin> is but buzz in gen3? probably not, right?
[2023-01-07 15:25:56] <Nyancy_Cat> naw
[2023-01-07 15:25:59] <anotherpangolin> bug buzz*
[2023-01-07 15:26:00] <%$thepurplekitty> @2pert ikr, what a weird thing to say XD
[2023-01-07 15:26:00] <%Taillow> Nope
[2023-01-07 15:26:12] <anotherpangolin> shame
[2023-01-07 15:26:15] <%Taillow> Signal Beam is the most solid bug move in gen 3 I think
[2023-01-07 15:26:23] <therollingninja777> nice HP
[2023-01-07 15:26:27] <pfiesteria> Nice

[2023-01-07 15:26:39] <Nyancy_Cat> wait future sight hits shed?
[2023-01-07 15:26:47] <%Taillow> Yeah, it's typeless this gen
[2023-01-07 15:26:54] <Nyancy_Cat> huh.
[2023-01-07 15:26:55] <%2pert> You could be facing sheds for the rest of the run, you might need the extra pp
[2023-01-07 15:27:06] <%+Pyron18> if we do get a fire move then we can replace Shadow Punch to get perfect coverage
[2023-01-07 15:27:09] <%Taillow> It changed gen... 5, was it? 6?
