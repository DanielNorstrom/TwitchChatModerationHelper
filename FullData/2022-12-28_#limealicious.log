[2022-12-28 00:21:50] <Putnam3145> unfortunately, the way things work means that multithreading wouldn't add much performance, since most of that CPU time is spent waiting on loading the 5 kilobyte units

[2022-12-28 00:22:07] <%+sc00tz0r> you can only melt down and reforge

[2022-12-28 00:23:17] <Putnam3145> the main performance issues are citizens checking if other units are in line of sight and then, once there's enough, the actual line-of-sight "are you friend or foe? are you family? and so on?" checks are worse

[2022-12-28 00:28:13] <Putnam3145> the fact is: pathfinding is really, really, really slow, but also it's not done very often, so it's not a major cause of FPS death, just FPS hiccups

[2022-12-28 00:31:54] <%ughdontmakemeregister> steel is better for everything else
[2022-12-28 00:31:54] <pyrobol> for blunt weapons, yes
[2022-12-28 00:31:55] <+maxzlock> idk but steel's heavier than feathers

[2022-12-28 00:32:13] <%bunglinglummox> silver is kind of equivalent for blunt, but worse than literally anything else for edged

[2022-12-28 00:33:08] <+ghost_mira> DF uses dwarf physics. Yes silver is a worse metal in every way for weaponsmithing, but in the dwarfiverse all that matters is how heavy your blunt instrument is

[2022-12-28 01:51:36] <%$Cpt_Chug> its quite the contrast going from this to rimworld where you can make someone instantly stop what they're doing and work on something else

[2022-12-28 01:52:54] <%$GoutetsuKame> do ur dwarves have enough boozes limes?
[2022-12-28 01:52:55] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> It takes a lot of time. Good idea for Rooms you want to be high-quality though
[2022-12-28 01:53:06] <%Dima3z> limesYikes
[2022-12-28 01:53:11] <Takinsur> yeah the old system was very manual
[2022-12-28 01:53:22] <%+SleepyCorpse_> Joel moments
[2022-12-28 01:53:26] <+artemis_dragmire> I played the old version and it threw me off that I didn't have to manually set every single dwarf to a job
[2022-12-28 01:53:34] <%nicolarre> old system was very involved and micromanaged
[2022-12-28 01:53:34] <+TiddlesnBits> The new system is pretty good though somethings are a bit... vague.
[2022-12-28 01:53:34] <+artemis_dragmire> it's so much easier to manage now though
[2022-12-28 01:53:37] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> People are way too used to Dwarf Therapist
[2022-12-28 01:53:39] <+ghost_mira> There were... are?... entire mods dedicated to getting specific dwarves to do specific jobs
[2022-12-28 01:53:40] <%KindredKin> luceCozy specialize as blanket burrito
[2022-12-28 01:53:45] <Fattyminime> im definitely doing something wrong when i have 150 dwarves and my fps tanks to 15. there just tasks never completed
[2022-12-28 01:53:53] <+TiddlesnBits> I never used dwarf therapist personally, could never get it to work lol
[2022-12-28 01:53:57] <Putnam3145> people were very mad at me about that post
[2022-12-28 01:53:57] <%FieldMedic4077> interesting limesHmm
[2022-12-28 01:54:00] <%$GoutetsuKame> @KindredKin  limesComfy
[2022-12-28 01:54:05] <macnme123> Yes. I have found the new labours systems to be pretty good. For most jobs, quality doesn;t matter. just that it gets done. A job will be given to the highest skilled dwarf, if that dwarf is not available, then the job will go to the next highest skilled dwarf
[2022-12-28 01:54:05] <@%Kovubot> limesPoggers
[2022-12-28 01:54:05] <+artemis_dragmire> I still build workshops and restrict them to one dwarf sometimes when I get like, a legendary weaponsmith in an early migrant wave or something
[2022-12-28 01:54:08] <!%Laimubot> There's a lot of red mist
[2022-12-28 01:54:08] <zizio> I only assign things if i get super skilled migrants that wont take nearly as long with crafting/farming
[2022-12-28 01:54:14] <+TiddlesnBits> @Fattyminime No thats just Dwarf Fortress being a beefy game that murders even modern cpus
[2022-12-28 01:54:15] <Delacue> I still specialise a bit as my fort gets bigger since I don't want my legendaries distracted by work that's beneath them
[2022-12-28 01:54:16] <mahi_saka> default tasking is so much nicer for sure
[2022-12-28 01:54:31] <Delacue> They should be making me masterworks
[2022-12-28 01:54:31] <%+JordanU> I find setting world history to 50 instead of 100 helps a ton too
[2022-12-28 01:54:32] <Kos475> idk if it still happens but if cats breed out of control it tanks the framerate hard

[2022-12-28 01:54:37] <Putnam3145> for some reason they thought I was telling them they were playing the game wrong when actually I was just telling them that the way they play is just not how the game's development is going to go
[2022-12-28 01:54:58] <%JeffOverTime> Maybe someday we'll get multithreading limesSob
[2022-12-28 01:54:59] <+ghost_mira> make small worlds and keep your forts as path efficient as possible. ever tile a npc has to walk over is another calculation
[2022-12-28 01:55:01] <Putnam3145> cache size matters a lot too, cache performance in general

[2022-12-28 01:55:05] <Fattyminime> i think my problems with water/wells and having too many jobs is the cause. im running a 5800x

[2022-12-28 01:55:15] <Putnam3145> @ghost_mira pathfinding is barely a factor even on very, very large forts
[2022-12-28 01:55:21] <$Equinox4> it's all the tiny moving parts that add up to alot for pc strain from this game
[2022-12-28 01:55:22] <A_Traitor> well im hopefully getting a new computer soon that will let me play more recent games, ive like not been able to play a lot of new games to to my old ass pc
[2022-12-28 01:55:28] <%+PhoenixSundae> The one thing I've had to micro is preventing my entire fort from trying to perform surgery while the real surgeon is hauling a sock somewhere
[2022-12-28 01:55:35] <%+Judexe> i find it hard to believe this game only runs on 1 core
[2022-12-28 01:55:40] <Putnam3145> it's checking-units-in-line-of-sight calculations that are the big issue
[2022-12-28 01:55:55] <%$GoutetsuKame> i was afk did u kill all the FBs limes?
[2022-12-28 01:55:57] <Putnam3145> @Judexe hi, i'm "devin chat", and i will tell you: it runs on 5 cores but one of them is graphics and three of them are sound and thus irrelevant

[2022-12-28 23:35:53] <TastySammiches> the switch port of this is actually surprisingly good
[2022-12-28 23:35:53] <czalon> well, it was made as a psp game
[2022-12-28 23:35:54] <czalon> so.... yeah

[2022-12-28 23:38:56] <%+angel_chelsi> Yeah I wouldn't be shocked for Sony to make a swtich/steam deck like thing considering the success of both. I just hope if they do they won't make the same awful decisions

[2022-12-28 23:45:02] <@%Cpt_Barricade> i think it's like coldplay
[2022-12-28 23:45:03] <FasciJR> People hate it because it's popular
[2022-12-28 23:45:05] <%Hedobot> They sound like advert music
[2022-12-28 23:45:07] <NovaAurora> I'm RADIOACTIVE
[2022-12-28 23:45:16] <%jakebikay> all their songs are the same

[2022-12-28 23:45:23] <%JoJo0217> honestly it just sounds bland to me, but I don't exactly hate them
[2022-12-28 23:45:24] <%+angel_chelsi> they have gotten very generic, but I did love their albums Night Visions and Smoke and Mirrors
[2022-12-28 23:45:25] <%iglopop> feel its like nickelback 2.0
[2022-12-28 23:45:26] <TastySammiches> @Cpt_Barricade the thing is coldplay was actually good at one point
[2022-12-28 23:45:27] <%+MoltenMermaid> Imagine Dragons are the modern day Nickleback.
[2022-12-28 23:45:29] <%iglopop> just boring

[2022-12-28 23:45:39] <%+angel_chelsi> Night Visions and Smoke and Mirrors I will defend. The other stuff...not so much
