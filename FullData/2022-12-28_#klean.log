[2022-12-28 00:00:04] <guessillgrowup> it's more satisfying too
[2022-12-28 00:00:06] <p2wftl> @guessillgrowup have you found an official confirmation for the drops from BSG?
[2022-12-28 00:00:22] <guessillgrowup> @p2wftl nope LUL
[2022-12-28 00:00:26] <Peakasso> and also from an IRL point of view
[2022-12-28 00:00:27] <anchovyjones> Fuck that animation is sex

[2022-12-28 00:00:39] <+cheesy_nibblets> klean getting on battlebit tonight?
[2022-12-28 00:00:40] <%BerlinCB> I admire they don't follow trends, but stick with their vision of the game they want.
[2022-12-28 00:00:44] <+BootyPaper> everyone got an opinion
[2022-12-28 00:00:53] <+GGTremble> and if you dont like that route they choose than you have the choice to not play
[2022-12-28 00:00:54] <+eljebus0> Oh shit, forgot about BattleBit!
[2022-12-28 00:01:09] <GroudonEX> i think landmark in this raid @klean
[2022-12-28 00:01:10] <p2wftl> @guessillgrowup @siddo__ thought so KEKW
[2022-12-28 00:01:13] <guessillgrowup> @p2wftl only thing i've seen is that streamers confirmed that there is drops coming. no dates though
[2022-12-28 00:01:15] <Peakasso> @berlincb i like that too
[2022-12-28 00:01:15] <+volcomwolf_> BattleBit gonna be SICK
[2022-12-28 00:01:16] <+Niallsie> if there was a solo queue, teams would queue together anyway

[2022-12-28 00:03:20] <siddo__> @p2wftl yeah bro i think its just a coincidence that 90% of streamers all have the exact same date. jesus
[2022-12-28 00:03:20] <bmac1572> @guessillgrowup I be alive being prone gives some protection to explosions in this game. That might be why the guy survived

[2022-12-28 00:03:53] <%BerlinCB> Or make a zone around it and omit refuse/corpses and they should move it.

[2022-12-28 00:06:10] <p2wftl> @siddo__ the wipe was supposed to be 2 weeks ago. It's why pestily flew in toast to have a subathon. it's delayed like it was 2 years ago, was a month back then.
[2022-12-28 00:06:20] <stillforlorn> @guessillgrowup Sweet! Yeah I guess I worded the question poorly.
[2022-12-28 00:06:20] <+eljebus0> Do you have a battlebit server you are looking to play on tonight? Or just whatever is up and running?

[2022-12-28 00:07:04] <themissing8> This song is my alarm tone.

[2022-12-28 00:07:22] <%+Nivek_Relyk> probably a 64v64 then not the huge 128v128
[2022-12-28 00:07:22] <%viperr636> Awesome! That sounds fun
[2022-12-28 00:07:33] <+eljebus0> That would be so cool.

[2022-12-28 00:08:26] <p2wftl> @siddo__ why would pestily fly in toast for a "pre-wipe subathon" KEKW look at the history, was always during the beginning of the wipe.

[2022-12-28 00:09:01] <siddo__> @p2wftl i mean everyone knows that the wipe was supposed to be soon, him flying in earlier doesnt mean that it was originally supposed to be earlier
[2022-12-28 00:09:06] <+TommyHawkk> You gonna get Shroud back on with you this wipe?
[2022-12-28 00:09:06] <+PinkPepper13> @lokil93 yes
[2022-12-28 00:09:23] <chucifers> @lokil93 not at all
[2022-12-28 00:09:25] <donkirton91> battlebit looks insane gameplay is unreal bro
[2022-12-28 00:09:28] <%BerlinCB> A lot of people prefer solo @lokil93
[2022-12-28 00:09:36] <+Niallsie> i think pestily, by his own admission, is just a bit socially awkward
[2022-12-28 00:09:52] <siddo__> @p2wftl of course maybe it was supposed to be earlier, but its just as much of a "source" as all streamers saying drops are the 29th
[2022-12-28 00:10:02] <%BerlinCB> I am old and have low mechanical skill.  But I know every map like the back of my hand and am a sneaky f*ck.  LUL

[2022-12-28 00:10:11] <Rapidsaitek> can you preview the settings image somehow?
[2022-12-28 00:10:19] <Kotva_> I liked @Klean and WZ playing together, WZ being that aim crack head but Klean outsmarting his enemies was a sight to see, hopefully you get to do some duos again <3
[2022-12-28 00:10:20] <%+akimboyeo> @BerlinCB so i have a stockpile for corpses, all corpses, that comes under refuse, my dwarves still aren't moving that yak.. not sure what their problem is
[2022-12-28 00:10:22] <guessillgrowup> @lokil93 just don't be discouraged to die a lot. it's gonna happen. that's one big thing for people i think, plus one day it'll all just click for you and you'll start destroying people
[2022-12-28 00:10:25] <Surlaw1_> <3 you klean

[2022-12-28 00:10:40] <%+moosE3knucklE> i still pull up maps sometimes to find where im going... even 3k hours into tarkov.
[2022-12-28 00:10:58] <%BerlinCB> Can you make a 1 square zone around it and exclude corpses and see if they move it?  That is really odd.
[2022-12-28 00:11:05] <+undersmoker9000> sounds like new year celebrations

[2022-12-28 01:19:48] <%BerlinCB> I just bought Kenshi this Steam Sale.

[2022-12-28 01:20:51] <Ratedxv> I honestly think they need to revert recoil for that to happen because almost every gun used to be a beam
[2022-12-28 01:20:54] <+QBall162> Ooooooooh, good ones on the belt feds. Bring in the 240B and let my squad mate be my ammo bitch. xD

[2022-12-28 01:22:26] <B1itzKrieg_80b> honestly I think the changes to 556 this wipe made the M4s a lot better
[2022-12-28 01:22:30] <%RoxLinen> but need a lot of balancing
[2022-12-28 01:22:31] <ReasonableDictator> I dont mind a meta I just don't like that its so easily obtained
[2022-12-28 01:22:41] <+d3rpdarp> aren't all metas super narrow in all games though? from WoW to tarky.
[2022-12-28 01:22:46] <rgrbeattie> Cant do it in Tarkov anymore, everyone uses 7.62bp and fucking M62 ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper

[2022-12-28 01:23:20] <LuteGoblinz> true
[2022-12-28 01:23:24] <smhamilton> The trick is to have them all be good and still be different.

[2022-12-28 01:23:43] <Boone_1776> last I was playing I was mopping up with a lil 74u @spacesteg

[2022-12-28 01:24:08] <LuteGoblinz> agreed 100% i think its alittle lackluster when every gun looks the same with no individuality
[2022-12-28 01:24:18] <+d3rpdarp> might be dumb here, but isn't the ability of battlebit to have no meta is the fact that it's a little bit more simplistic?
[2022-12-28 01:24:41] <BEAUTIFUL_SCOTT> what about where you PLACE the attachments on the rails as well giving you different benefits
[2022-12-28 01:24:48] <lodinn> Best solo class/gear, or for team. Do you mean to imply dark and darker is the first metaless game?‚Ä¶
[2022-12-28 01:24:51] <Vonkv> m4 is nerfed on damage (even with longer barrrel), scars have advantage in close range

[2022-12-28 01:25:13] <+remington_thunderknife> i think the battlefield games are pretty good with allowing the player to decide what guns they like
[2022-12-28 01:25:28] <+d3rpdarp> because honestly battlebit reminds me of old school battlefield in that regard. where so long as you know what to do with it, you'll shine.

[2022-12-28 01:25:57] <LuteGoblinz> fighters with the all weapons perk is great for using a bow and having a shield an what not
[2022-12-28 01:26:04] <%KevinSredz> I would 100% love if all guns in Tarkov were viable. With 100 guns in the game, it feels like there is no variety at all..

[2022-12-28 01:26:13] <LuteGoblinz> yeah fighter solo is nuts
[2022-12-28 01:26:18] <sneaky937> rogue, fighter, ranger and wizard are strong solo

[2022-12-28 01:27:18] <+HypnoticRaven> Personal opinion but I wish EFT would lower base recoil so stock guns are far closer too the meta version and make attachment buffs far smaller. it should be more of a level playing field with tradeoffs for attachment types, not really meta attachments. Essentially cut attachment values in half at least. I think the base SAG models are a good example.

[2022-12-28 01:32:06] <ReasonableDictator> @Klean thoughts on having a flea market level that adjusts depending on fence rep or PMC karma? like base lvl flea is barter items and flea lvl 3 has weapon attachments.

[2022-12-28 01:40:00] <actuallypopa> Marauders was SUPER fun for me for like.... a week. progression falls off a cliff after you hit level 6 or 7 with all the traders
[2022-12-28 01:40:01] <cribbageboard> rdr2 is worth a play 100%
[2022-12-28 01:40:01] <DoubleDose42> red dead is still worth it but it can be slow

[2022-12-28 01:40:15] <+eljebus0> RDR2 was amazing.
[2022-12-28 01:40:15] <nottap_> rd2 is incredible
[2022-12-28 01:40:15] <+pheeshy> spent so much time playing online rdr`
[2022-12-28 01:40:17] <%BerlinCB> Yeah, RDR2 is one of my favorite games ever.
[2022-12-28 01:40:18] <ReasonableDictator> dude the cycle is better than marauders I said it
[2022-12-28 01:40:18] <+ChaceG> Red Dead RP has 200+ people servers now, they‚Äôre kinda cracked
[2022-12-28 01:40:19] <TheBradest> RDR2 has best story
[2022-12-28 01:40:19] <@%+fortburke> Shivering isles... best dlc of all time
[2022-12-28 01:40:20] <captain_c0c0nut> there was a firefight

[2022-12-28 01:40:23] <pc_rook> I was gonna get rdr2 but then I saw it needed a third party launcher ü§Æ
[2022-12-28 01:40:25] <%+Chardoo> I just replayed it earlier this year. So fucking good
[2022-12-28 01:40:25] <MoonRoccs> wish they made nightmare for RDR2 FeelsBadMan
[2022-12-28 01:40:27] <Sallyzard> why no t7's?
[2022-12-28 01:40:30] <SneakySmoker38> Seths dialog in UDN was amazingly funny @Klean
[2022-12-28 01:40:30] <Kwaib> Its slow paced, but if you have a few hours to set aside you can get lost.
[2022-12-28 01:40:31] <whitecinder> its too bad they abandoned RDR2 though, no more content
[2022-12-28 01:40:32] <blzdkrusadr> @quinnseitz you‚Äôre so right. They just give us trash games these days no story or anything to it just hear buy buy buy
[2022-12-28 01:40:37] <%ToxikToad> Story and gameplay is superb in rdr2
[2022-12-28 01:40:39] <%hunt559> both bad lol
[2022-12-28 01:40:40] <Gelrandil> rdr2 is my all time fav game
[2022-12-28 01:40:44] <siddo__> if the cycle didnt feel so clunky it would be awesome
[2022-12-28 01:40:45] <+biggiefresh5> rdr2 is top 3 greatest games of all time
[2022-12-28 01:40:45] <bmac1572> The detail in that game is amazing
[2022-12-28 01:40:46] <ItzHarvey03> @klean are you into the last of us?
[2022-12-28 01:40:47] <+QuinnSeitz> i also dont like the cycle lmfao i need real guns not toy nerf guns
[2022-12-28 01:40:48] <5hoo> marauders is more arcadey
[2022-12-28 01:40:48] <mixtellow> I played undead nightmare on 360 quite a bit ExtraLife

[2022-12-28 01:42:06] <%SupraVT> the cycle was awesome, just a lot of cheaters and gunplay was iffy, good sometimes sometimes bad
[2022-12-28 01:42:07] <junkfarmer> 80 wasn't enough

[2022-12-28 02:11:44] <%Happy_Blitzkrieg> The only "games" that can help train you for real life is like MSFS but even then only limited
[2022-12-28 02:11:46] <Lourio> Battle Bit opened up their playtests during the week too?  Amazing!

[2022-12-28 02:12:07] <nottap_> you can test weapons in the shooting range while you wait for servers chat
[2022-12-28 02:12:12] <+Ramstore7> I looooove battlebit
[2022-12-28 02:12:16] <SmityStone_jr> if its not tomorrow then its obviously Thursday ANGRE Despairge or maybe we are in a endless prewipe event and nobody know when it actually is and we are all simply stuck in a simulation
[2022-12-28 02:12:21] <+jackthestripper> it runs like butter
[2022-12-28 02:12:24] <iroSasquatch> Battlebit is the game you want to bring home to meet the parents
[2022-12-28 02:12:25] <+AJtv> I checked it out because I saw you playing it the other day day seqEvil
[2022-12-28 02:12:26] <siddo__> @dabsNbrews same, its one of the only games i really look forward to playing

[2022-12-28 02:12:49] <%+darthbosco_19> I wonder if FlightSim helps to learn to fly airplanes
[2022-12-28 02:12:53] <+OpeItsAdam> BattleBit is by far the best arcade FPS to come out in awhile
[2022-12-28 02:12:54] <+AJtv> Oh snap what's up @dabsNbrews <3

[2022-12-28 02:13:47] <%Borlng> L4D2 a classic
[2022-12-28 02:13:48] <siddo__> @Borlng its a pre wipe event, all the loot in the map spawns there
[2022-12-28 02:13:49] <+ViolentDecay> @Borlng it's an event, no loot anywhere but single areas each map.
[2022-12-28 02:13:50] <+cheatdeath368> csgo????

[2022-12-28 02:13:57] <%TheYellaKing> team fortress 2. played the hell out of that as a kid
[2022-12-28 02:13:57] <whitecinder> @Klean I just started playing it yesterday, love it so far
[2022-12-28 02:13:58] <Lourio> We want hl3
[2022-12-28 02:13:59] <%RoxLinen> source 2 inc
[2022-12-28 02:14:00] <@%dabsNbrews> lfd2 was amazing
[2022-12-28 02:14:01] <%Borlng> Ah I see I see
[2022-12-28 02:14:02] <%Happy_Blitzkrieg> if you like LFD2 then you gotta play Rock and stone
[2022-12-28 02:14:07] <%shmoe_shman> L4D so fucking goated
[2022-12-28 02:14:07] <%TeflonVipers> L4D2 was fun. Modding it was hilariously fun
[2022-12-28 02:14:09] <%VoiceOfGrog> Have you tried Back 4 Blood? @Klean
[2022-12-28 02:14:10] <TheBradest> VR makes me sick... I couldn't play Alyx
[2022-12-28 02:14:10] <%+darthbosco_19> @FrankObvi classic
[2022-12-28 02:14:15] <@%dabsNbrews> the hours i spent playing that at my buddies lan center lol
[2022-12-28 02:14:19] <Lourio> I hope!
[2022-12-28 02:14:21] <sneaky937> they are building a new source engine surely
[2022-12-28 02:14:22] <LuteGoblinz> i feel like a new ip would be better than half life 3 at this point with all the expectations
[2022-12-28 02:14:22] <%Borlng> Half-Life Alyx was just made to sell their Steam VR. All Valve games the past decade have been made to sell something else :(
[2022-12-28 02:14:23] <siddo__> they have no reason to release half life 3, all it can do is dissapoint
[2022-12-28 02:14:24] <%TeflonVipers> Fighting Zombies as Darth Vader with a Guitar was amazing
[2022-12-28 02:14:27] <sneaky937> B4B was trash
[2022-12-28 02:14:28] <+FatRat_> Wasn't it already written out that it wasn't happening?
[2022-12-28 02:14:30] <%KniefChief> back 4 blood was so bad
[2022-12-28 02:14:33] <%+J412536987> The mods for L4D2 have made it so replayable
[2022-12-28 02:14:37] <Zinzio> hl3 will never happen :(
[2022-12-28 02:14:37] <%+AttemptedPants> HL3 wont happen. The hype is too big, so the game will ALWAYS be a disappointment
[2022-12-28 02:14:40] <r3ap3rth3p33p3r> how do you feel about that stalker movie? i forgot whos making it lol
[2022-12-28 02:14:41] <%RoxLinen> back 4 blood is fun but not even close to l4f2
[2022-12-28 02:14:46] <+zzzzDEEMANzzzz> @kennysexman It‚Äôs decent 1060 and 16 gig i7
[2022-12-28 02:14:48] <%RoxLinen> l4d2
[2022-12-28 02:14:53] <Lourio> I always replay the half life from time to time, shit‚Äôs too good!
[2022-12-28 02:14:54] <%KimorySelkies> I've heard they've tried 2 a bunch of times and always canned it cause it was "revolutionary"
[2022-12-28 02:14:54] <+jackthestripper> i smell a pmc
[2022-12-28 02:14:55] <+Advan0s> @Happy_Blitzkrieg ITs deep rock galactic my man LUL People use this phrase so much they think its how the game is called
[2022-12-28 02:14:59] <%VoiceOfGrog> @KniefChief Oh shoot, I was wondering. :/ Heard mixed reviews amongst friends.
[2022-12-28 02:14:59] <%KimorySelkies> 3 I mean

[2022-12-28 02:15:06] <Lourio> *series
[2022-12-28 02:15:12] <%Borlng> I need to get back into Alyx and beat it though that game was peak VR.

[2022-12-28 02:35:03] <+Socks242> Even if weed is legal in your state, it's still a federal crime. This just means your states law enforcement can't/won't do anything but they cannot stop federal law enforcement from getting to you.

[2022-12-28 02:52:23] <+DeadlyDays> when a game spends more money on advertising than game development
[2022-12-28 02:52:26] <besser_> @Klean I have a better ideia, accept the 10K and give it to charity and explain that when you are promoting the game.
[2022-12-28 02:52:27] <hummy_marek> 10k for that .. thez down bad

[2022-12-28 02:54:48] <%ColeChiIls> To be fair 60-80 days in a game you have thousands of hours in is good. Most games struggle to get that retention @Klean
[2022-12-28 02:54:51] <%+altezza300> yeah i was wondering about that too
[2022-12-28 02:54:54] <%Borlng> That must be a hectic Trello/Notion board.

[2022-12-28 04:15:54] <+Typehigh> you also have the tendency to stand way in the open when you engage, use the environment to shade, wiggle peak, etc.

[2022-12-28 04:28:37] <%TxPage> @Klean  thank you so much for showing me this game!
[2022-12-28 04:29:06] <+Typehigh> Rush is way harder to design than like Conquest, when it comes to map, m-com locations, etc.
[2022-12-28 04:29:24] <cropd_> how is the sniping in BattleBit?
[2022-12-28 04:29:32] <+Typehigh> even in Battlefield Rush has been hit and miss in the different titles, BC2 did it well, BF3 too, BF4 was meh, etc.
[2022-12-28 04:29:39] <%sheriff_nottingham> since bfbc2

[2022-12-28 04:30:22] <soul_si1ver> battlefield 3 was so epic
[2022-12-28 04:30:23] <%Paulbearier> big studios forgot how to make games while they persued graphics.
[2022-12-28 04:30:24] <+ViolentDecay> Just played the first time, got to lvl 8. It's a breath of fresh air for sure
[2022-12-28 04:30:25] <+Zaedred> Kinda reminds me of Battlefield Bad Company
[2022-12-28 04:30:35] <+Typehigh> I think that both BF2042 and BattleBit have shown that more players doesn't equal better, though
[2022-12-28 04:30:48] <+Silver__Core> Are you on a dedicated server or just quick play?
[2022-12-28 04:30:48] <5cavlive5matt3r> I remembered BF3. Multiplayer was fun.
[2022-12-28 04:30:53] <envycg> even for the amount of players in a lobby, 2042's maps were too big.
[2022-12-28 04:30:57] <+JDrach> the full auto gameplay in BF1 was botched
[2022-12-28 04:31:00] <+Typehigh> yeah, BF1 is a pretty good game
[2022-12-28 04:31:08] <+JDrach> I loved the aesthetics and map design in BF1

[2022-12-28 04:31:28] <%sheriff_nottingham> cinematics and immersion in bf1 are unbeatable but the gameplay was lacking

[2022-12-28 04:34:25] <Pyroboy85> BF hasn‚Äôt been food since BF BC2 for me. Had some fun with 3 but it was falling apart by then for me

[2022-12-28 04:35:22] <+Typehigh> @Mad_Larkin 2042 is quite playable now. It's not as good as BF4, but it's not the completely unplayable PoS it was before
[2022-12-28 04:35:30] <+Mad_Larkin> like this game looks like a ton of fun, looks like it plays like a slightly more casual Hell Let Loose , but still tons of tactics and teamwork required
[2022-12-28 04:35:39] <+twistidmetal> @Klean is that the same ring from  Dark and Darker?

[2022-12-28 13:28:31] <NeLZi94> @displosionz i think it's still an audio from Valve
[2022-12-28 13:28:34] <%Likemybutton> @displosionz real gamers don't hear audio because they play with maska anyway
[2022-12-28 13:28:36] <NeLZi94> like steam audio

[2022-12-28 13:32:58] <Mr_Quartermaine> as long as audio is usable its going to be fun! that's my take

[2022-12-28 14:03:12] <@%$Ripper203> Yeah hoping the new audio changes are much better, probably the biggest thing thats put me of playing Tarky for a while
[2022-12-28 14:03:13] <Sandzibar> do you have headset recommendations then for good sound?
[2022-12-28 14:03:16] <jdchaple> I dont know anything about the new audio in tarkov do you?
[2022-12-28 14:03:20] <VampyMonsta> @Mrshilka well if they were face to face , but they dare not say to ur face wolfTea wolfSip

[2022-12-28 14:03:23] <AstraN7> wait new audio is coming too? did they fix steam audio?
[2022-12-28 14:03:36] <RizzoTheRad> Hey Klean, is there a place where you store your VODs? Always love watching how you "do" the eraly game
[2022-12-28 14:03:41] VIEWERS: 2¬†427
[2022-12-28 14:03:41] <%EvoUtd> but i still think peekers advantage is huge in tarkov. watching lvndmark, when he is fast peeking enemies just standing there doing nothing @Klean
[2022-12-28 14:03:44] <@%Mrshilka> @VampyMonsta yeah internet has given rise to that lol
[2022-12-28 14:03:44] <ZombieWeed1> @Klean we have missed the splinter cell raides
[2022-12-28 14:03:45] <Dzzze> Not even a streamer?
[2022-12-28 14:03:45] <%renegadefrag5> and I love the difference in play style in the community
[2022-12-28 14:03:46] <ChrisBolkof> Lmmfao
[2022-12-28 14:03:46] <jdchaple> like occulous audio or something
[2022-12-28 14:03:46] <+DayXP> AstraN7 they removed steam audio and went for oculus
[2022-12-28 14:03:48] <@%$Ripper203> @AstraN7 Replaced with Oculus audio
[2022-12-28 14:03:50] <+El_Mutchos> @AstraN7 completely removed and added occulus
[2022-12-28 14:03:55] <mrmimiii> crazy
[2022-12-28 14:03:56] <blazeee> @Klean do you think they'll change the beginning quests since Nikita said streets will be the first map available on full release?
[2022-12-28 14:03:59] <%+dess1m> its crazy to me seeing cod discussions, if you stop for a second, youre a camper. people get so tunnel visioned on shit that doesnt matter
[2022-12-28 14:04:00] <+owFero> Klean whens the next time youre gonna play some stalkerz? They just changed a bunch of the Radiation areas around the map to be very potent, and increased mutant spawns, and are close to making a huge underground tunnel expansion.
[2022-12-28 14:04:26] <AstraN7> o snap aight lets see how it runs ty bois @DayXP @Ripper203 @El_Mutchos
[2022-12-28 14:04:27] <+El_Mutchos> Peekers advantage will be a thing until servers are higher tickrate.
[2022-12-28 14:04:38] <@%$Ripper203> @AstraN7 Prayge
[2022-12-28 14:04:40] <kuskapog> any idea about principal difference between oculus and steam audio? How is it better
[2022-12-28 14:04:49] <@%Mrshilka> its a new sound engine
[2022-12-28 14:04:52] <DarthWhatever> it also REALLY depends on the corner, and how obvious the position youre holding is
[2022-12-28 14:04:56] <%+classicx> prefire strong
[2022-12-28 14:05:07] <+jsand84> I live in San Antonio  where do you live?
[2022-12-28 14:05:07] <@%Mrshilka> the new sound has removed much of the old occulion that we had before
[2022-12-28 14:05:08] <kuskapog> @Mrshilka im aware lol
[2022-12-28 14:05:09] <+kalizarr> I bet it's funky fresh
[2022-12-28 14:05:11] <@%$Ripper203> Alpha Factory peeker's KEKW
[2022-12-28 14:05:13] <ElPonete> someone told me that fast peeck doesnt exist anymore.... Its true?
[2022-12-28 14:05:13] <%wubnoxious> better directional slightly worse quality
[2022-12-28 14:05:22] <AstraN7> Veritas will prob have a video about it
[2022-12-28 14:05:25] <%+youngdadgod> Peeker's advantage is just a reality of every fps game these days. Even Valorant supposedly heavily focused on eliminating peeker's advantage, still has peeker's advantage. Latency just as a whole isn't there yet to really tackle it
[2022-12-28 14:05:27] <ChrisBolkof> Serious
[2022-12-28 14:05:30] <Ruski_1425> spatial audio awareness is the only thing that matters

[2022-12-28 14:08:25] <%p1nkape> just didnt mention what it is
[2022-12-28 14:08:34] <%KlngofGods> I remember nikita saying he delayed the hitboxes for streets @Klean
[2022-12-28 14:08:39] <+kazuhira_> @Klean did you notice in the trailer that one scene where the player scavs agree with each other not to shoot the PMC with his back turned? Think they're implementing some kind of scav > PMC karma system maybe?
[2022-12-28 14:08:45] <+Divi77e> hello what do you guys think, will there be difference in recoil in 556? cuz it's kinda underwhelming
[2022-12-28 14:08:50] <DarthWhatever> i was under the impression that the armor hitbox system was scrapped and they're sticking with replaceable plates
[2022-12-28 14:08:51] <+Divi77e> rn
[2022-12-28 14:08:59] <@%Mrshilka> under your arms is a real life kill zone with botharmour
[2022-12-28 14:09:02] <blazeee> wasn't that system scrapped?
[2022-12-28 14:09:04] <jhon_carpenter> I know it s dead but I was hoping they reduce the aiming stability, debuff the speed run and gun...but it s not the case
[2022-12-28 14:09:04] <@%Mrshilka> and eft will follow that
[2022-12-28 14:09:07] <Ruski_1425> so realistic armor hitboxes now
[2022-12-28 14:09:11] <%wubnoxious> I cant wait to try SR2
[2022-12-28 14:09:15] <Ruski_1425> or soon
[2022-12-28 14:09:18] <ElPonete> @Sinewave True. I am not play running or full w. And in my opinion they have to reduce this. But for the people, i am wrong.. i am just bad player.
[2022-12-28 14:09:21] <DarthWhatever> very cool
[2022-12-28 14:09:23] <%p1nkape> are they adding leeg armor at anypoint?
[2022-12-28 14:09:24] <Ratedxv> I hope so man tired of the META
[2022-12-28 14:09:29] <blazeee> Do you think they've changed the first quests since Nikita said that streets will be the first map available on launch?
[2022-12-28 14:09:36] <Eastern_Cowboy> HP round from a pistol in the armpits should wreck about anyone once that gets implemented
[2022-12-28 14:09:37] [Notification] MatthewPraetor subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! [To many months ahead of us, take care my dude, have fun with the new wipe.]
[2022-12-28 14:09:41] <%+youngdadgod> heavy armor will finally be good too, meta might shift towards more representation of big boy armor instead of slick hex
[2022-12-28 14:09:42] <chipthewopp> how long ago did they say 2 hours anyone know

[2022-12-28 14:10:09] <kuskapog> that will be extremely hard to execute for developers (armor that works this way)
[2022-12-28 14:10:10] <JobbyAuditor> attachments and skills are the only parts I really dislike in EFT
[2022-12-28 14:10:10] <%p1nkape> its 2hours from end of 6 hours
[2022-12-28 14:10:21] <kuskapog> idk if any other game has that
[2022-12-28 14:10:24] <Ratedxv> Like you said yesterday BattleBit Remastered does a good job making EVERY gun a viable weapon
[2022-12-28 14:10:25] <+warliczek> @Klean gl in the new wipe friend :-) <3
[2022-12-28 14:10:41] <%LustPlayz> not gonna lie biggest issue i've ever had with tarkov is the level requirement for max traders
[2022-12-28 14:10:45] <+kazuhira_> There shouldnt be attachments that give such extreme bonuses IMO, they should all relatively be close together in terms of benefits, with maybe more rare attachments having a marginal difference if any at all
[2022-12-28 14:10:47] <AbnerLucas3010> shouldnt they change the recoil system for that?
[2022-12-28 14:10:54] <ElPonete> I see a lot of weapons with low ERGO because the pvp its from the hip most of the  time.
[2022-12-28 14:10:56] <%ColeChiIls> I wanna be a Russian space cowboy dammit!

[2022-12-28 14:11:27] <+iPeryxo> a solution to this is to make attachments only FIR
[2022-12-28 14:11:32] <+KillerRoninTV> It would be cool if you could level up with the attachments
[2022-12-28 14:11:39] <%Ljosapaldr> I don't even get why their stats are distributed like it's an rpg, lol
[2022-12-28 14:11:42] VIEWERS: 2¬†484
[2022-12-28 14:11:57] <+KillerRoninTV> then no one knows what attachments are amazing you make them good by using them
[2022-12-28 14:11:58] <%HyperStipherX> Morning Klean
[2022-12-28 14:12:01] <@%Mrshilka> the A! Aug IS shit
[2022-12-28 14:12:02] <%sembranor_> But then you need to unlock them at the same time. if you unlock them differently thats not good balance
[2022-12-28 14:12:06] <@%Mrshilka> A1 even
[2022-12-28 14:12:15] <@%Mrshilka> the F88 is a terrible gun irl
[2022-12-28 14:12:21] <+Thaulus> @Klean My solution for this is to make players have to use what they can and not hey want.
[2022-12-28 14:12:22] <+kazuhira_> either make good attachments FIR like high tier ammo, or rebalance all attachments to be generally the same in terms of pros/cons
[2022-12-28 14:12:24] <@%Mrshilka> I missed my SLR
[2022-12-28 14:12:24] <fur3x> once the meta attachments become unavailable theres just gonna be new "trader meta" attachment
[2022-12-28 14:12:26] <+Breker99> I believe more attachments should have same stats like all silencers same, all muzzle brakes same,  all stocks then its easy to balance and gives more option for you to make most build viable
[2022-12-28 14:12:27] <+ahoardyboi> @klean what if you had a GAMMA-style weapon system, with parts exchange through traders?
[2022-12-28 14:12:34] <+BananaKidJoe> what about boosting ergo more to make like actual different builds?? @Klean
[2022-12-28 14:12:35] <%otf_sinisterone> @Klean whats up my brother! Happy Wipe Day
[2022-12-28 14:12:44] <NogginKnocker_> Klean, I am here, never fear
[2022-12-28 14:12:46] <%wubnoxious> the AUG
[2022-12-28 14:12:52] <%wubnoxious> and the SR2 KEKW
[2022-12-28 14:12:55] <%thall9179> its either op out the gate or its garbage
[2022-12-28 14:12:55] <@%Mrshilka> roll the dice Pog
[2022-12-28 14:12:57] <+kazuhira_> actually true lmao
[2022-12-28 14:12:58] <+NavaresFR> true LUL
[2022-12-28 14:13:00] <bippo_tm> rfb
[2022-12-28 14:13:04] <+Divi77e> I think that recoil of 556 a lil over the top
[2022-12-28 14:13:07] <DarthWhatever> scar?
[2022-12-28 14:13:10] <+kazuhira_> besides the M3 maybe, M3 is just giga chad tier but not broken
[2022-12-28 14:13:10] <@%+fortburke> Naa but the scars are kind of mid tier
[2022-12-28 14:13:15] <@Packap_> original mdr was kinda in between
[2022-12-28 14:13:16] <+awding> UMP?
[2022-12-28 14:13:17] <+Breker99> SR2 meta this patch AUG prob meme
[2022-12-28 14:13:18] <karimstar_> aug is 5.56 so probably gonna be bad Sadge LUL
[2022-12-28 14:13:18] <fromthekron> probably not by design
[2022-12-28 14:13:19] <infinitylive2000> p90?
[2022-12-28 14:13:20] <%+youngdadgod> Maybe if they made ergo have more advantages other than fast ads and more stamina, Recoil stats feel too necessary because of visual recoil
[2022-12-28 14:13:21] <Ratedxv> Back in Pre-recoil overhaul when M4/HK canted sight was META ALOT of other guns were viable because they were beams
[2022-12-28 14:13:23] <%+CrowGB> double barrelled?
[2022-12-28 14:13:24] <AbnerLucas3010> what abt 556 mdr?
[2022-12-28 14:13:27] <%LustPlayz> ngl the new smg, the russian mp7 loooks like is gonna be a piece of trash lmao
[2022-12-28 14:13:30] <Hidirean> i've been waiting for the sr-2m
[2022-12-28 14:13:30] <The_official_red_shadow> 5.56 mdr wasnt that bad
[2022-12-28 14:13:31] <+Divi77e> like g36, hk and scar ure just shooting in sky first 2 bullet
[2022-12-28 14:13:31] <fromthekron> its hard to make a gun balanced without that community test/feedback
[2022-12-28 14:13:33] <+kazuhira_> NOBODY used the UMP on release lmao
[2022-12-28 14:13:37] <+kazuhira_> literally nobody
[2022-12-28 14:13:38] <%+Nemo120> I was so sad to see how bad the G36 was when it dropped

[2022-12-28 14:13:48] <+Thaulus> Semi auto ak, it is quite good because it has zero recoil

[2022-12-28 14:15:56] <+Thaulus> to be honest i dont care how strong weapon can be, stock should be good enough to be playable and rest should be balanced by difficulty to find
[2022-12-28 14:15:58] <%+SiLoNoVa> Still praying for a 22. LR Prayge
[2022-12-28 14:15:58] <@%Mrshilka> Uzi with the long as supressor

[2022-12-28 14:23:06] <+buffalotrucker> BattleBit is the most fun I've had playing a shooter in years. Reminds me of playing the old Battlefield games on my Xbox when I was younger.

[2022-12-28 14:35:55] <+Electric_Goblin> shutter slows to let in more light because it is dark
[2022-12-28 14:35:56] <+jinxplayer> It must be the ISO settings or something kleen
[2022-12-28 14:35:56] <Jandlez> gotta be an auto setting
[2022-12-28 14:35:57] <@%Mrshilka> suckers its 30c everyday here
[2022-12-28 14:35:58] <DarthWhatever> its your camera compensating for the light, it is taxing
[2022-12-28 14:36:00] <%LustPlayz> @Mrshilka Klean is exception i know he'll treat er right kleanUgh
[2022-12-28 14:36:03] <+MaxWeeman> Seems like its because of automatic shutter speed.
[2022-12-28 14:36:04] <GUCCIMANELAFLARE1017> compensating for low light perhaps
[2022-12-28 14:36:07] <lordperrywinkle> come have a vacation in Australia, its always sunny over here rn
[2022-12-28 14:36:08] <%+henryho96> i think it's dropping your frame rate for dark lighting. may have to change your auto-adjustment
[2022-12-28 14:36:19] <+Jindsu> @Mrshilka where at?
[2022-12-28 14:36:19] <Jandlez> yeah it will lag out from autoing constantly
[2022-12-28 14:36:19] <FeyRazzle> Auto ISO does that to mine too
[2022-12-28 14:36:20] <+KevJohn_> Not focus, but auto exposure settings
[2022-12-28 14:36:21] <%+Emperor_Ad3ptus> I heard sunning your balls is good for test. thoughts @Klean
[2022-12-28 14:36:24] <%+henryho96> may have to change it manually depending on your light
[2022-12-28 14:36:27] <+xReaper_2_1> -10 F here a few days ago
[2022-12-28 14:36:28] <Richardlong776> you going usec or bear?
[2022-12-28 14:36:31] <@%Mrshilka> @Jindsu Australia
[2022-12-28 14:36:31] <Astrix023> boost ur low light in cam settings, or up the cam brightness a bit, it helped for me on my logiteh cam with lowlight fps
[2022-12-28 14:36:36] <+KevJohn_> I have an a6500 so similar camera
[2022-12-28 14:36:38] <%+FuzzyMountainBeaver> night mode makes exposures longer to brighten up the image, so thats why your frames drop
[2022-12-28 14:36:38] <+Jindsu> dope
[2022-12-28 14:36:38] <%wubnoxious> pepeJAM
[2022-12-28 14:36:47] <+jinxplayer> focus is handled with the lens but the sensor needs light or it will compensate with a higher ISO which likely is the issue @Klean
[2022-12-28 14:36:53] <@%Mrshilka> my misses can keep her tans year round here, not had a cold winter here in years
[2022-12-28 14:36:57] <Dzzze> Got a playlist with these chill tunes my guy?
[2022-12-28 14:37:00] <%Noxspector> frame rate goes down because it needs longer exposure to compensate for less light.
[2022-12-28 14:37:03] <%+youngdadgod> it's probably exposure, lower light causes it to process the image more to help with exposure I think, where in good lighting it doesn't need as much processing

[2022-12-28 14:42:20] <%debo337> Indie better then AAA for sure
[2022-12-28 14:42:21] <%ItsRender> Its a story generation, world simulator.

[2022-12-28 14:52:36] <yeavo> Cheating is also a vicious loop due to efts loot based gameplay loop where when you can't get good loot due to cheaters you're more and more tempted to cheat yourself.. Only ones winning are the cheat providers

[2022-12-28 14:56:44] <MisterZero_> Kappa
[2022-12-28 14:56:45] <averagedrinks> drops have been ass though
[2022-12-28 14:56:46] <@%Mrshilka> Drops should just be anime waifu skins NODDERS
[2022-12-28 14:56:51] <+highway0311a> Level 55 allowed me to get it this wipe.
[2022-12-28 14:56:52] <+Landid> If you get kappa you already sitting good lol
[2022-12-28 14:56:55] <%+youngdadgod> by the time you get kappa, it's pretty useless

[2022-12-28 14:57:04] <+highway0311a> I like it at 55
[2022-12-28 14:57:08] <+Andcef> kinda disappointed that no advanced armor/rig system changes made it in, not even hitboxes
[2022-12-28 14:57:09] <Surlaw1_> they changed it this wipe?
[2022-12-28 14:57:14] <nem0404> They should lock secure container in raid
[2022-12-28 14:57:14] <+zerodotingz> I stopped going for it cuz its 62 takes too much time
[2022-12-28 14:57:14] <+Jindsu> bigger bussy
[2022-12-28 14:57:18] <5cavlive5matt3r> I think kappa is valued not really for its utility but it's a status symbol. A trophy. It's people wanting to show they have a big dick bearkiSip
[2022-12-28 14:57:22] <+zerodotingz> 55 was good
[2022-12-28 14:57:22] <%+RUSSTRADAMUS> If you get kappa you probably dont need the extra 3 slots more of a convenience
[2022-12-28 14:57:23] <MAGSWAP> @penaleve doesn't really improve fps and isn't as good quality wise. If you play at 1080 you might as well have it off. Now for this wipe FSR 2.1 is getting implemented so we will have to see for that
[2022-12-28 14:57:24] <Jandlez> everyone wants the biggest bussy

[2022-12-28 14:57:38] <%wittinlol> @5cavlive5matt3r yeah man it's more of a flex than anything
[2022-12-28 14:57:39] <+YaBoiZach19> armor system?
[2022-12-28 14:57:40] <OraceonLive> Is there a chance the armor system is added, just not in the patchnotes?
[2022-12-28 14:57:42] <5cavlive5matt3r> I would like to achieve kappa one day, only because I want to show to myself I can be commensurate of the gme.
[2022-12-28 14:57:45] <PewZapDie> The containers don‚Äôt make sense for a game that‚Äôs ‚Äúrealistic‚Äù

[2022-12-28 14:58:03] <yeavo> At the point you are ready to get your Kappa-container you're already at the point losing stuff really isn't that big of a deal. It's 100% a flex
[2022-12-28 14:58:04] <%wubnoxious> @PewZapDie the game isnt realistic though KEKW just the gunplay

[2022-12-28 14:58:16] <5cavlive5matt3r> @5cavlive5matt3r I mean I'd like to get kappa but not  for status per se, but it can be a measure of your own skill of the game. It shows you how far you've gone if you understand NODDERS
[2022-12-28 14:58:16] <+Landid> So youre saying im not gonna know if people got x lvl armor just by a glance?

[2022-12-28 15:15:10] <5cavlive5matt3r> @joshgav The way I say see it is that it's understandable to be frustrated. But the way I see it, as an argument against the critics, is (1) BSG just wants to create video games we enjoy, and (2) it's important to have ties with RU, socially, and culturally even in this time.

[2022-12-28 17:22:33] <crumbald> What boggles my mind is why they removed Israel server. Now my lowest ping server is like 90-100 ping. Doesn't make sense

[2022-12-28 17:24:03] <greenbucky> is the new in game sound system on by default or do we enable it?
[2022-12-28 17:24:07] <%$trickypig> im stuck on same screen, do we just chill and let it work itself out?
[2022-12-28 17:24:07] <+creatureofgrace_> they go hard first 2 wipes. then they start going ok. I'll sleep this wipe

[2022-12-28 17:25:11] <GUCCIMANELAFLARE1017> what you should do tho is download some more ram
[2022-12-28 17:25:12] <%+datmanbiskit> so how is the sound?  does it seem like it has improved or is it too soon to tell?
[2022-12-28 17:25:15] <+Thaulus> My FPS is like 20% lower than previous wipe. Maybe binural sound dont work with my pc very well
[2022-12-28 17:25:18] <%darcss> i got a slow ram
[2022-12-28 17:25:27] <+ToreiSh> do they usually roll back in this situation? i can't remember exactly what they did last time
[2022-12-28 17:25:28] <Boone_1776> is the in-game RAM cleaner not recommended?
[2022-12-28 17:25:31] <tocSicle> 3200 fast enough

[2022-12-28 17:26:46] <+Nilsson23> i think lightkeeper is rep based or locked behind a quest, i saw deadlyslob went over there in offline raid, it looks like a code you put in not a keycard
[2022-12-28 17:26:49] <+Sugabuga87> the new audio is nice, the impact sound of stray bullets is wild
[2022-12-28 17:26:55] <+Thaulus> @Marcskel did you try with and without binural?
[2022-12-28 17:27:00] <+Kusyck> distant shootings stopped bugging out and making ears bleed

[2022-12-28 17:27:16] <+ToreiSh> they definitely changed something about audio this wipe, i like it so far
[2022-12-28 17:27:18] <kayc187> did they rework the sound? didnt play for months
[2022-12-28 17:27:20] <+Overcast22> steam audio is gone, they were never going to get hunt showdown level steam audio the game wasnt built for it like hunt was
[2022-12-28 17:27:22] <%Marcskel> @Thaulus Nah not yet
[2022-12-28 17:27:24] <%5cavlive5matt3r> How is positional audio?
[2022-12-28 17:27:27] <eXBlade21> Performance was pretty bad for me sadly because only 16gb ram and 2700x processor. 150fps on Factory but 40 on streets
[2022-12-28 17:27:32] <+cykaq49> @Klean Bro I honestly think your game looks the best out of anyone I watch, wish I had a powerful PC to be able to play on the standard Ultra settings, how it would be supposed to be played no Post FX
[2022-12-28 17:27:32] <%+blitzkriegmf> the launcher download speed is atrocious
[2022-12-28 17:27:41] <%5cavlive5matt3r> That sounds good to hear.

[2022-12-28 17:31:45] <+Ceeps0> man imagine having a queue system to limit downloads to people in a line, totally impossible huh
[2022-12-28 17:31:48] <@%JaxPC> servers are giga expensive, and it's not always possible to flick a switch and have servers available
[2022-12-28 17:31:51] <+KyrianZ> can't play on my pmc, always server connection lost when going into raid, but scav is fine
[2022-12-28 17:31:52] <%+Pwnappl3> @Hank1929 dudes out here like "just use EC2!" lol
[2022-12-28 17:31:55] <%NorsePhoenixS1D> @Klean look at COD, game still has crashes and had a horrible launch

[2022-12-28 17:32:08] <%+k0dey> Klean! Have my prime. Thanks for the entertainment over the years.
[2022-12-28 17:32:12] <+ZZJarosz> @NorsePhoenixS1D Thats a full game launch not a patch though
[2022-12-28 17:32:16] <Revolverheld1229> I can‚Äôt imagine it‚Äôs financially logical to buy server space for a tiny window of higher than average activity
[2022-12-28 17:32:25] <+nyb25> 3200mhz good?
[2022-12-28 17:32:26] <+Hank1929> it's funny how poeple act like they know what goes into making these games work and are just like "buy more servers" like it's taht simple
[2022-12-28 17:32:35] <%wurlo_> I have 32gb at 3600 mhz and it runs great, 3200 should have no issue

[2022-12-28 17:32:42] <amitchell2116> Some issues with memory usage for sure, noticed that myself when playing streets

[2022-12-28 17:33:42] <Vohveliz> Yeah not a good idea to back out
[2022-12-28 17:33:43] <guessillgrowup> yeah don't do it, that's where i'm stuck now lol
[2022-12-28 17:33:43] <Heroin_son> also be careful on streets one of the out of bounds snipers is right near a spawn and you can die right as you get in if you walk 5 ft the wrong way
[2022-12-28 17:33:45] <know1nose> @zero_vaas Tarkov mistake #1 don‚Äôt close the game
[2022-12-28 17:33:45] <jesquik> They could do it if they were willing to let the server costs grow through auto provisioning on a cloud provider. Usually the cause of these things is that they set hard limits on that growth to keep costs under control, or they are managing their servers themselves so they have a physical limit.
[2022-12-28 17:33:46] <%+Pwnappl3> @Klean can confirm the bad gateway error
[2022-12-28 17:33:49] <ColonelBT> the login servers are down or something, dont exit the game

[2022-12-28 17:34:02] <%+LeftyJ> the scavs got some new drip aswell
[2022-12-28 17:34:02] <%+Jurgenaut2> They could plan for and get all the infrastructure for their max players at launch, but would end up not using most of that infrastructure for the rest of the wipe. Seems like a huge money sink in the end.

[2022-12-28 17:34:52] <I_am_kyo_kyo> some people might be doing some Fucky things to the backend

[2022-12-28 17:35:30] <CycIoneTM> @Klean, their home screen of the game is based of html thats why you can keep playing the game when your in a game the way they made this game is shit OMEGALUL
[2022-12-28 17:35:35] <+HooverMaxProModel60> chat will it be worth going from 1080ti to the 4090 in end of 2023? or should i just wait for the 5000 series at that point? how often do they come out with new series?
[2022-12-28 17:35:37] <ColonelBT> Deadlyslob got to the door but it was locked
[2022-12-28 17:35:39] <%5cavlive5matt3r> @MilaweaX The crash is probably because the servers broke down and not because of Streets
[2022-12-28 17:35:41] <MilaweaX> @5cavlive5matt3r if you have a good CPU you should be good, this was on 1440p also

[2022-12-28 17:36:00] <DustyEskimo> There's a flare extract, which makes me think on top of having to do that tasks, you'll need a flare to alert the sniper boss to not shoot you on the way to LK

[2022-12-28 17:36:14] <+ToreiSh> @Jurgenaut2 bsg buys all of their server space from third party data centers. i didn't major in software engineering so i'm no expert, but from an outside point of view it seems like they could just rent more space for the first weekish of wipe
[2022-12-28 17:36:16] <+owFero> @HooverMaxProModel60 just get a 4090

[2022-12-28 17:37:11] <TokkyoZ> Performance on street pretty good but.. It seem they nerf AI spawn and loot spawn for reach this performance or na ?
[2022-12-28 17:37:13] <+TheGeekfam> I got a gtx 1080 16GB RAM and Ryzen 7 1700 only getting like 20fps RIP
[2022-12-28 17:37:14] <heistr0> for a medium and pc its gonna be borderline unplayable sadge
[2022-12-28 17:37:15] <BaracusFly> hi @klean hope you're doing good brother. have a good wipe!
[2022-12-28 17:37:17] <+Finaltrap22> I know stumbling around for exfil can be fun, but is there a map image out yet for streets? I'd rather be able to find an exfil.
[2022-12-28 17:37:18] <+thathighbigguy> i reset my game it wont let me back in
[2022-12-28 17:37:18] <Respect_> @HooverMaxProModel60 unless you're doing machine learning work or VFX, 3xxx series is the way to go IMO
[2022-12-28 17:37:18] <BVRGE_> I just got back in
[2022-12-28 17:37:24] <+ReveralX> 50 is what i was getting on customs before, so 50 on streets is realy good

[2022-12-28 17:37:30] <+ifenceyourgear> keep getting a post error

[2022-12-28 17:37:44] <%uncledaddyy_> @thegeekfam 32gb ram would help loads I think
[2022-12-28 17:37:45] <%5cavlive5matt3r> @TheGeekfam It seems the problem is that you don't have enough RAM. 32GB is recommended.
[2022-12-28 17:37:45] <TSvassilev> @TheGeekfam I've got 32GB ram. maybe that's it?
[2022-12-28 17:37:47] <%+succulenthamm> it's probably done terribly lol

[2022-12-28 17:38:02] <Respect_> I suspect the nolife dweebs are DDOSing

[2022-12-28 17:38:34] <+XSummerXSpace> Since certain servers are getting overloaded. We need to distribute the load of the servers guys.

[2022-12-28 17:38:52] <%5cavlive5matt3r> @TheGeekfam I'm not a technical expert, but I've heard that this is more CPU intensive and GPU. We should be able to have decent performance even with 1060-1080 if we have good RAM.
[2022-12-28 17:38:53] <+Hank1929> ah they didnt' do the updates to the group invite stuff
[2022-12-28 17:38:56] <%+Jurgenaut2> @ToreiSh Some sort temporary infrastructure buff would make sense to handle the increased load of wipe day, but I have no idea what the logistics of that would look like. Best left to the experts lol

[2022-12-28 18:20:27] <Psykkotikz> Please I need tarkov to work. I took off from work and school in order to play this game. Tarkov is more than a game for me its my life. I need the servers to work in order to go on with my life. I dont think I can operate as a human being unless tarkov works again. My girlfriend recently just said that she would leave me if tarkov doesnt start working again. At this point please fix the servers I need it. Nikita im begging to you

[2022-12-28 21:08:59] <%Ws_minion> @JoshuaGuzz Id rather it was a separate thing personally, I like that you can gauge if someone is being aggro towards you if theyre aiming but if its ADS to zoom then they could just be trying to get a better look at you
[2022-12-28 21:09:09] <+xPowell> how do you level armor skills?

[2022-12-28 21:10:20] <@%$JoshuaGuzz> @Satannogria Maybe it's just all the really popular FPS games. I know for a fact that 90% of Call of Duty and Battlefield games have it.

[2022-12-28 21:57:21] <bmac1572> Pestily did complain about the recoil being to little in tarkov like 3 years ago
[2022-12-28 21:57:21] <Vohveliz> it's annoying how they wanna keep the "auto recoil compensation" that occurs after you lay down like 6 shots
[2022-12-28 21:57:25] <Vohveliz> bursting is bullshit

[2022-12-28 22:08:40] <+wolfheart2823> well, trying to find my buddies now is an issue in matchmaking lol. sigh, damn it
[2022-12-28 22:08:58] <DoctorLiquid> @FocusFocusFocus doesn't really make the game too easy because you can't sell in the flea market if it's not found in raid afaik.
[2022-12-28 22:09:03] <peakysnete> can you queue still or are servers fucked in general

[2022-12-28 22:18:26] <%LordAssman> @ArthriticOne I'd say go with the smallest package and try the game first. You can upgrade your account later, if you really want the 5 tiles of extra butt space

[2022-12-28 22:19:48] <justcarbunkle> solo makes it easier to blend in with player scavs
[2022-12-28 22:19:48] <hobbes8calvin586> yo hows wipe day been
[2022-12-28 22:19:48] <%KrackinWise313> Solo on wipe day = getting ganked

[2022-12-28 22:20:16] <+copewidit> Its working for me now
[2022-12-28 22:20:37] <tinderviddles> are solo players just outnumbered by squads or something?
[2022-12-28 22:20:39] <%KevinSredz> is it just me or does covert movement not lower your footstep audio?
[2022-12-28 22:20:47] <Vohveliz> especially if you wanna rush quests early
[2022-12-28 22:20:48] <+ShowtimeIX> Ive just been avoiding fights early on

[2022-12-28 22:21:34] <I4mAnnoying> I always love the start of the wipe, u dont run into juggernauts that can tank ur whole mag and its fun
[2022-12-28 22:21:38] <Vohveliz> and some people just aren't up to it

[2022-12-28 22:27:48] <%ThatRednec> @Klean kenshi or dwarf fortress if you could only afford one?
[2022-12-28 22:27:50] <%ForsaikenRedskye> @BBWLord two different games.
[2022-12-28 22:27:52] <+barcode_i> anyone who makes a game has to make basic 8bit then basic 16bit then 32bit then 64bit etc...in terms of generation and 2d/3d ability

[2022-12-28 22:28:22] <+BigBoyBrown13> I want Tarkov, Fallout, and I Am Legend to make a baby. graphics like RDR2, whole country sized map.
[2022-12-28 22:28:23] <+Billy7heKid> Kenshi
[2022-12-28 22:28:28] <+BBWLord> @ForsaikenRedskye you rember that game tho? it was like hitman but ninja
[2022-12-28 22:28:31] <%AntiParagon> Dwarf fortress can be grabbed for free, if you're okay with older versions.
[2022-12-28 22:28:31] <@%GryphonM> i think DF for me
[2022-12-28 22:28:32] <%ColeChiIls> Id say kenshi since kenshi 2 isnt out
[2022-12-28 22:28:32] <%ThatRednec> I was leaning kenshi
[2022-12-28 22:28:34] <%SlanAbhaile> After 1300+ hours in Kenshi you kinda have learned everything
[2022-12-28 22:28:37] <%ThatRednec> word
[2022-12-28 22:28:38] <%LordAssman> I'd say Kenshi, if you have a graphics card KEKW
[2022-12-28 22:28:40] <%Ljosapaldr> Kenshi is easier to get into
[2022-12-28 22:28:45] <%quorke> kenshi i havent put enough time into dwarf fortress
[2022-12-28 22:28:49] <%Ljosapaldr> I would choose DF for myself, but I'd recommend others Kenshi
[2022-12-28 22:28:54] <Mr_Quartermaine> these tarkov lobby's are giving  time to grow my beard out.
[2022-12-28 22:28:56] <%+magnetcross> kenshi is amazing, open world, do w/e you want, hard, grind etc

[2022-12-28 22:29:42] <%SlanAbhaile> Pray Kenshi 2 doesn't release at the same time STALKER2 does Kappa

[2022-12-28 23:09:35] <+Sh3llburn> @GoXander I wouldn't insure the expensive stuff, since that will surely be looted off your body unless you're really lucky. Also, use therapist. While she's more expensive, she's also faster to recover your items and she holds them longer before tossing them out.
[2022-12-28 23:09:56] <%+StealthyHazboola> Vite Ramen, sounds GMO with extra MSG kleanYes kleanKORK

[2022-12-28 23:51:00] <+Alienhightimes1> still way below 1mb/s
[2022-12-28 23:51:03] <%+ObnoxiousMuffin> What happened to nice player scavs? Lol. First raid, scav raid, murdered by player scav with 6 min left
[2022-12-28 23:51:36] <%Ljosapaldr> @ObnoxiousMuffin People care more about money than rep right now, I guess
[2022-12-28 23:52:12] <Vohveliz> yeah it's a scav eat scav world early on
[2022-12-28 23:52:25] <%NorsePhoenixS1D> Marked Room / Circle on Streets is fucking nutz lol
[2022-12-28 23:52:27] <Vohveliz> got a shotgun in your back? somebody wants that for a quest

[2022-12-28 23:53:15] <%+moosE3knucklE> dawg the weapon repair kits are HEAVY as shit. i got out with one and god i couldnt move lol
[2022-12-28 23:53:19] <Surako> Also, I wish BSG would let us buy super cheap night vision goggles early. That way more people would go for nightraids
[2022-12-28 23:53:43] <Vohveliz> yeah the monocular with an IR illuminator is the coolest shit if you find one early
[2022-12-28 23:53:45] <InfinitumDiver> PVS-7s and shit
[2022-12-28 23:53:48] <%+moosE3knucklE> i mean armor not weapon
[2022-12-28 23:53:51] <+RebelFoxtrot> @Surako True. Just a shitty one eyed night vision or something.
[2022-12-28 23:54:45] <+RebelFoxtrot> Klean I love how you play the game. Everyone else would be full sprint pushing.

[2022-12-28 23:55:05] <Vohveliz> jesus christ that's jason bourne
[2022-12-28 23:55:21] <Surako> @RebelFoxtrot yeah exactly. Im actually suprised that they have not done that already. You could lock it behind a quest which sets up an early night raid
[2022-12-28 23:55:59] <stevedegreek> !drops
[2022-12-28 23:56:15] <Vohveliz> i wonder if they locked M80 behind quests now
[2022-12-28 23:56:39] <hashi401> Yoo chat any youtubers you guys suggest for settings? I'm still chopping for sum reason or you guys just deal with the same issue
[2022-12-28 23:56:44] <Vohveliz> damn dude has his buddy nailed by 2 geared dudes and still flanks and pushes you

[2022-12-28 23:58:18] <Vohveliz> i wonder if they scaled walking noise more with weight than covert movement now
[2022-12-28 23:58:25] <+TOPGUNxVIPER> good thing he came off the rock to you
[2022-12-28 23:58:32] <hashi401> yea thats in game setting but i see people adjust things out of the game on NVIDEA settings
[2022-12-28 23:58:46] <bobthemutant> 5.45 has been done dirty the past few wipes. Non-lethal headshots beyond 100m is moronic.
[2022-12-28 23:58:48] <%+FrostyyTheSnowThug> that could be the perception perk or listening w.e it is. they might have tweaked it
[2022-12-28 23:58:48] VIEWERS: 2¬†182
[2022-12-28 23:59:11] <Vohveliz> also all skills are reset so it's def gonna mess with your hearing perception of the game
[2022-12-28 23:59:15] <Two_Hands> No changes to recoil system and weapon handling overall is why I am not jumping into this wipe immediately.
[2022-12-28 23:59:20] <Vohveliz> i know it fucks me up every time LUL
[2022-12-28 23:59:40] <%KevinSredz> @Two_Hands yeah its why im not at all excited for it. Played a few raids and i feel like its going to be just as stale as last wipe
