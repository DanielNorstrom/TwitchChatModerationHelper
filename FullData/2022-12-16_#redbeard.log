[2022-12-16 07:38:54] <Sebola3D> have they told us exactly how the rune system works in draft? i.e. you can't get cards you're inelligible for, but how does that affect your odds of getting class cards?
[2022-12-16 07:39:26] <Sebola3D> do they re-roll? are the ineligible cards just removed from the pool?

[2022-12-16 08:21:11] <%moh_elkhatib> What I would like to see is Arena-specific card buffs to other classes. But Blizzard aint going to do sh*t
[2022-12-16 08:21:47] <%gchlmp> Card buffs would be weird. Should just be choose rate of card picks

[2022-12-16 08:23:00] <Veritas_12647> It's a good idea in the minds of the arena regulars, but from a business standpoint, making multiple statlines or effects for cards in different modes makes it really confusing for new players.
[2022-12-16 08:23:21] <%theskivingscholar> What new players?
[2022-12-16 08:23:37] <%+jascallion> i remember way back they tried to implement "synergy picks" to encourage an archetype during your draft, but i remember the synergy cards being garbino

[2022-12-16 08:54:55] <stevethyme> Standard wishes have their own currency, its not worth it to use primogems on it because you can get the standard characters and weapons when you lose 50/50 on the event and weapon banners. Event and weapon wishes rotates every 3 weeks or so, thats why you can miss it and we never know when they are coming back. In the long run, you will get the standard characters and weapons anyway and there is a very small chance only to get what you want from standard because there are a lot of 5 stars

[2022-12-16 08:57:18] <@%gesticulate> using primogems on standard wishes? you better believe that's a paddling
[2022-12-16 08:57:19] <@%Tazny> Also he said the best weapons for Yae were Windsith & Solar Pearl
[2022-12-16 08:58:02] VIEWERS: 591
[2022-12-16 08:58:02] <stevethyme> yeah, you get standard wishes from a few different sources, when you level up a character, you get a few, you can buy 5 every month from the paimon shop for free (you get the currency for it by wishing), so you can wish there too, but its not worth spending your primos on it

[2022-12-16 11:33:17] <%+Da_Biff> !q
[2022-12-16 11:33:27] <!%Ellyon> I once accidentally ordered laundry bags that were way too big (I just needed a small one for bra washing). Now I use them to throw in all my laundry and then I just throw the whole bag in the machine. Very useful when going on holiday or a weekend away. Plus socks don't get lost in the machine anymore @gesticulate
[2022-12-16 11:33:31] <!%GeordieTwitch> @SFWildBill live your life to the full mate, we never know how long or short the time we have left is <3
[2022-12-16 11:33:53] <%+KotoHiAme> Honestly, I have been playing with my friend mostly because it's fun talking shit and then seeing cards you haven't gotten yet.
[2022-12-16 11:34:27] <@%gesticulate> @Ellyon do clothes still get cleaned enough? part of the washing comes from the clothes rubbing against each other
[2022-12-16 11:34:32] <%+NExt__88> @SFWildBill Ill be praying for you, that this wont be your last Christmas and you'll have an amazing turn around <3

[2022-12-16 11:34:52] <!%Ellyon> when coming back from one holiday and visiting my parents I used their laundry machine and my mum said she wanted bags like that. Knowing her she didn't buy any yet I ordered more for her :)
