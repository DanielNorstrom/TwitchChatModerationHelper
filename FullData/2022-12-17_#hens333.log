[2022-12-17 14:57:04] <komaprolurker> @i_can_hz_chzbrgr yea but if you're tired of prove you run Discordance and pressure them off gens, Eruption is just hope you're not on a gen when some goes down
[2022-12-17 14:57:05] <ZW3IST3IN> I would make the same mistake as this Wesker 2 days a go but now I would wait and rather M1 and save the second charge
[2022-12-17 14:57:13] <I_Can_Hz_Chzbrgr> reassurance is not that bad, unless it's a coordinated team that can use it efficiently to take away pressure, eruption and prove are different cause any dodo can slap it on and get value

[2022-12-17 15:02:57] <%+DemonicGhost27_> i mean we sit in a meta where survuvors only wanna sit on gens and killers want to kick and tunnel its not good for either side
[2022-12-17 15:03:00] <komaprolurker> @zippyzaean if you dont win almost everygame when running slowdown maybe the gen rushing isnt the issue entirely
[2022-12-17 15:03:02] <lawnmowergame> as a new player who should i prestige first for shared perks

[2022-12-17 15:03:25] <zippyzaean> like if you don't run any slowdown perks I might call you an idiot cause survivors are gonna do gens faster than sonic the hedgehog running.
[2022-12-17 15:03:25] <komaprolurker> @lawnmowergame Surv or Killer?
[2022-12-17 15:03:31] <lawnmowergame> surv

[2022-12-17 15:04:09] <randomman55555> Mettle and object is pretty fun
[2022-12-17 15:04:10] <ZW3IST3IN> Like a leathel pursuit on survivor side?
[2022-12-17 15:04:10] <frenchsmudgestick> @lawnmowergame Kate has window of opportunity but you'll have to unlock her with iri shards
[2022-12-17 15:04:10] <%A2Zephyr> idk what old object was
[2022-12-17 15:04:16] <+Devington_> nah
[2022-12-17 15:04:16] <%+mig_rattlehead> I think probably
[2022-12-17 15:04:27] <lawnmowergame> thanks guys
[2022-12-17 15:04:34] <Cairsoir> > implying you aren't rolled for picking trapper anyway
[2022-12-17 15:04:38] <maxthmin> not ok
[2022-12-17 15:04:41] <I_Can_Hz_Chzbrgr> zippyzaean that's not true for all games homie, like i run different builds with no slowdown a lot and i admit there are games i get shit on bad, but there are evenly games that i 4k at 2 or 3 gens left
[2022-12-17 15:04:43] <%the_oracle_> these days, trapper gets rolled anyways peeTaco
[2022-12-17 15:04:44] <%+BarelyLive> what about premonition for killer?
[2022-12-17 15:04:52] <ItsAGF> 4 dc's in 2 sec everyone see nurse KEKW
[2022-12-17 15:04:52] VIEWERS: 515
[2022-12-17 15:04:59] <%Coffin_Beans> a perk like that would be nutty in a SWF.

[2022-12-17 15:06:07] <%itizAJ> i dislike how now u can see killers aura when they have aura perks
[2022-12-17 15:06:16] <ZW3IST3IN> Yeah I would say the bordline cases would be a problem the Trapper Case as well as the survs DCing becaus of nurse
[2022-12-17 15:06:20] <%+mig_rattlehead> object felt so bad as killer
[2022-12-17 15:06:21] <%Coffin_Beans> Old Object made me want to cry as a baby killer. KEKW
[2022-12-17 15:06:24] <Southrobin> @itizaj it’s been fixed
[2022-12-17 15:06:26] <%+magic_mat1> @ItsAGF Lol yeah I remember pretty much that as a Nurse main with old Object
[2022-12-17 15:06:32] <nolifealice> swf ruined it KEKW
[2022-12-17 15:06:36] <%GENJ1SMOM> I mean object on midwich was so  boring as killer
[2022-12-17 15:06:43] <%+DemonicGhost27_> i always ignore the object player Lol
[2022-12-17 15:06:52] <nolifealice> their totem as near the gen

[2022-12-17 15:13:41] <Southrobin> Just seems like more value than stopping the killer for 3s
[2022-12-17 15:13:47] <Southrobin> If used well
[2022-12-17 15:13:55] <life_blight> i actually dont know it either

[2022-12-17 15:26:09] <%+briguy145> ahh okay, I've only played against pinhead a couple times so I could never figure that out. Thanks
[2022-12-17 15:26:22] <%+BarelyLive> do you think they should stop releasing 3 new perks per killer / surv?

[2022-12-17 15:29:26] <@%Ana1661> @DeSaads2 Hi welcome in BlushHugBow
[2022-12-17 15:29:26] <Danneren_> Are there many here in chat, who is going to watch the WC final tomorrow?
[2022-12-17 15:29:27] <tikki_dbd> there are just too less top mmr players to have matches with only top mmr, so the matches are mich more likely to be around mid mmr, with rarely player with top mmr. if top mmr players lose in those matches they get pushed down a lot. as you lose more if you are higher
[2022-12-17 15:29:27] <%+mig_rattlehead> DeSaads2 hello there hensHug

[2022-12-17 15:29:47] <!%roxannagv> i think it's just people interpreting things in the wrong way otzShrug i certainly didn't get the impression you said mmr is a myth

[2022-12-17 15:29:49] <%the_oracle_> i think part of it some ppl would rather blindly criticise the devs by saying "MMR doesnt exist" rather than try to understand how it's implimented
[2022-12-17 15:29:52] <Danneren_> SOLID HIT

[2022-12-17 15:32:25] <+brix_26> The pool where everyone is together is too large, but also when they make MMR accurate good ppl would wait 30 minutes for a match which would kinda kill dbd

[2022-12-17 15:35:10] <komaprolurker> @oagesus 1. Being sweaty ≠ Skilled, that sweaty nurse could have the same hours as the wraith but just play like they want to win 2. a wraith and a nurse aren't comparable 3. that statement doesn't mean mmr doesnt work

[2022-12-17 15:37:37] <+OAGesus> @komaprolurker it shouldnt even be possible in the first place to match against such a wide variety of skill level if they had done a good job with the mmr system. the reason why is because behaviour prioritizes queue time over mmr rating

[2022-12-17 15:39:36] <SilencedHeroYT> @Hens333 thoughts on making corrective action work in a 24 meter range of you instead of the guy on the same gen as you? I think that will make the perk at least somewhat thinkable
[2022-12-17 15:39:55] <ZW3IST3IN> Uh I never noticed but can you see if Huntress is out off hatches when there are none on her belt?

[2022-12-17 15:45:51] <+Hamboleo> open handed is so good for solo survivor, i use it with kindred and wiretap haha
[2022-12-17 15:45:52] <komaprolurker> @oagesus its intended to be loose hence the rework to the sbmm system after the game fell flat because a tight sbmm was destroying the game
[2022-12-17 15:45:56] <JayJ_Legion> think hes j a new wesker and used his power every single loop lol

[2022-12-17 15:46:48] <+OAGesus> @komaprolurker i mean true its more loose now but thats EXACTLY my point, its just TOO LOOSE, hence not a properly working mmr system

[2022-12-17 15:57:47] <Redvid1> stealth killers are too unfair i guess very good vs solo usseles vs swf

[2022-12-17 15:58:18] <%Arcanticrebel> I wish sadako had a lower rarity addon for turning back on her tvs. Condemned sadako is fun but I don’t have the points to farm iri addon
[2022-12-17 15:58:23] <aqua_o7> stealth killers are usually amazing against newbie / mediocre players @Redvid1 thats the only way i could see them being top on kills

[2022-12-17 15:58:40] <JayJ_Legion> @the_oracle_ ig more depends on if ur teams bad i feel tho if solo q

[2022-12-17 16:21:46] <SilencedHeroYT> @Hens333 I agree with you about the Knight, I do play him, but I wish his power was more interesting, maybe if his ghosts were more dynamic with what they did, he wouldn't be as painful as he is not
[2022-12-17 16:21:46] <2blrds1stone> @aqua_o7 you kind of have to just leave the loop or even leave early by predicting he will use his power

[2022-12-17 16:59:18] <$bloodyhunterx300> He is sometimes even stronger than Nurse because you can keep track on where survivors are and with Alchemist ring I would say he is stronger than basekit Nurse

[2022-12-17 17:05:27] <Zexulia> i always thought of having perks and add ons and items on a point system. like for example you have 15 max points in a loadout and higher impact perks and addons cost more. meaning you cant bring the best perks and the best addons without running out of space

[2022-12-17 17:07:27] <%+ForestGrandpa> @ForestGrandpa Yes, but the main counterplay to blight is to make him use as many rushes as possible, so you can get away during downtime. You can play alch ring and negate that completely
