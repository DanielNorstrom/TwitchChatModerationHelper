[2023-01-01 09:21:42] <@^Nightbot> If you want to do a tank request, stats check, field mods check by donating the minimum amount of 5‚Ç¨. New subs or resubs have the benefit of one free tank request/stats check with their sub/resub message, provided that Orza has that tank in garage. On special days you can request a tank with 500 copper by typing !redeem tank followed by the tank name.

[2023-01-01 11:18:49] <@^Nightbot> If you want to do a tank request, stats check, field mods check by donating the minimum amount of 5‚Ç¨. New subs or resubs have the benefit of one free tank request/stats check with their sub/resub message, provided that Orza has that tank in garage. On special days you can request a tank with 500 copper by typing !redeem tank followed by the tank name.
