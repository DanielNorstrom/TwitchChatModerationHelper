[2022-12-26 00:01:56] <+DarkJediKnight2002> only available in Atlantic Canada and New England region in the summer, when lobster is abundant. It is a lobster roll served in a hot dog bun with “lobster sauce” and shredded lettuce and was introduced in 1993. The product had supply issues and was not very profitable nationally.

[2022-12-26 02:02:36] <@%^StreamElements> freirtuck, Emongg's ult is on numpad4 because he plays with arrow keys. He does not play left handed. The reason the other abilities say E and Shift is because they are double bound.

[2022-12-26 02:42:41] <$kinnfolk> All the Day 1 OW players complaining about an old skin for a Drop. But you have to think there’s a lot of new players with OW2 being F2P. I’d think the skin was new for a good percentage of people. Just a thought 💭
[2022-12-26 02:43:02] <Blackdima4> Wonder if Blizz just really doesn't wanna nerf Soj, or if they just don't know how.

[2022-12-26 02:45:33] <$kinnfolk> @blowpez Bro, we’ve known the drops weren’t working from like 20 mins since they were announced so if you really wasted time away from family to watch a stream after knowing that, or even took time from family to watch a stream in the first place you have a lot more to worry about! LOL plus you can pull it up on your phone or a seperate tab on your Pc. 5Head

[2022-12-26 02:47:44] <+Blowpez> @ne0n_black Some people don't celebrate Christmas and other regions surprisingly have timezones that place them outside of 12/25 at this point

[2022-12-26 02:48:09] <%ne0n_black> yeah ok so someone not observing christmas wouldnt be taking time away from family during christmas
[2022-12-26 02:48:12] <%+massmscr> :D
[2022-12-26 02:48:19] <%ne0n_black> whats your point here?
[2022-12-26 02:48:38] <Blackdima4> Just because someone doesn't observe it, doesn't mean they can't appreciate the sentiment of wishing someone well. Stop getting offended for people
[2022-12-26 02:48:52] <$kinnfolk> @blowpez yeah but shit happens you just have to adapt. And people trip out about a stupid drop and make it way bigger deal then it is. So who cares. It’s not like ooops they took time to watch stream today, now they’ll never be able to make it back to a stream to watch for prolly an hour or somthing. LOL
[2022-12-26 02:48:56] <%ne0n_black> oh is this guy malding at christmas? definitely troll/bait
[2022-12-26 02:48:59] <+Blowpez> @ne0n_black They advertised a promotional event to happen on christmas day and you're saying no one should be annoyed they bungled it because they chose to drop it on a holiday without preparation

[2022-12-26 02:49:41] <%ne0n_black> ok lemme break this down. Christmas is a holiday observed by most americans, including secular americans or even americans of other faiths. Blizzard is an american company with american developers

[2022-12-26 17:03:41] <@%^StreamElements> If you're noticing ads at unfortunate times, Twitch now requires all streams to run ads at set intervals. We're not triggering them, they're on Twitch's end and out of our control.

I seen a lot of people say that the nerf was not enough for low level and really only nerfed her for pro play, but like you said, they just found a way around the nerf with the mercy pocket. I can't wait till they try and rotate her out of the meta. I'd rather play against a whole team of hogs than 1 really good sojourn.

You will be notified in chat and your notifications feed when you're able to claim. You can find your inventory and progress at twitch.tv/drops/inventory
