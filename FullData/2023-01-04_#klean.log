[2023-01-04 00:00:37] <ItsTvang> adjusting gain forces u to hear mic without gate
[2023-01-04 00:00:39] <%104th_Raccoon> go back to "condenser" in mic setup as you are using that cloud lifter. @Klean
[2023-01-04 00:00:40] <%ekozaur> man, we're backseating audio settings :( we're the worst
[2023-01-04 00:00:44] <dededsoul> good news is mic sounds even better now

[2023-01-04 00:01:52] <mrclean12> clear
[2023-01-04 00:01:53] <%Cursed4610> @Klean no
[2023-01-04 00:01:59] <takeyourb3> it just removes noise cancellation when you open those settings I guess
[2023-01-04 00:02:00] <Renny_UK> only when you open the settings do we hear the back ground
[2023-01-04 00:02:00] <%jishin> i dont hear shit in the background
[2023-01-04 00:02:00] <dededsoul> mic quality is better

[2023-01-04 00:02:11] <tkpequenino> for me audio is clear
[2023-01-04 00:02:14] <AyeGavMF> its only doing that when your monitor your own mic which is natural
[2023-01-04 00:02:19] <ddpbr> I cant tell the difference, jsut a little bit quieter

[2023-01-04 00:03:05] <%Freckles619> try adding the Audio Output in OBS
[2023-01-04 00:03:05] <SeeraX2> @Klean I figured out what is different, in the "DTS Unbound" store app, under the DTS X Headhphone, there is an "Configure" Option. In there there is an option "Spacial Mode - Balanced" and "Spacial Mode - Spacious", Also option to choose "Headphone, In-ear buds, noheadphones"

[2023-01-04 00:03:19] <+sltenoo> The mic is moderately better than before, it’s definitely an improvement
[2023-01-04 00:03:19] <kangtaum> no tarkov sounds perfect for me so i can play it myself

[2023-01-04 00:11:41] <YaBoiNeedle> @Klean What are you testing?
[2023-01-04 00:11:43] <AyCheck> started playing on UK servers....been cool hear ello chap from a scav
[2023-01-04 00:12:00] <%Ravejeuit> compressor
[2023-01-04 00:12:10] <trapys> so he switched his amp? Is the other one powerful enough?
[2023-01-04 00:12:20] <%ekozaur> @Klean does your dac/amp have a gain switch...?
[2023-01-04 00:12:21] <+johnshepherd1> we dont hear chat if chatt is mutted
[2023-01-04 00:12:22] <Ro4r_> he means twist the plug ?
[2023-01-04 00:12:23] <ItsTvang> what source is ur tarkov audio going out to?
[2023-01-04 00:12:23] <AyCheck> @Blaasram1 you have people you play with?
[2023-01-04 00:12:36] <AnthonyHomie69> @Klean Did you also double check "Advanced sound options" scroll down a bit per app Windows 10 loves to change these sometimes randomly you will need to have the game open for it to show sometimes
[2023-01-04 00:12:43] <trapys> that sounds like a underpowered amp to me
[2023-01-04 00:12:45] <%wubnoxious> NODDERS mo powa
[2023-01-04 00:12:50] <%Freckles619> Klean did you try adding OBS Audio Output
[2023-01-04 00:13:02] <+flipflapweenrslap> 100% needs more power, I had the same issue trying to use my GoXLR with my DT 1990 pros
[2023-01-04 00:13:08] <+flaymonthegamer> dolby access makes the sound audio alot louder aswell ive tried both dts and dolby
[2023-01-04 00:13:08] <Chris114> @Klean try restart after your cables arrive
[2023-01-04 00:13:10] <AnthonyHomie69> its under the sound output you had open just had to scroll down

[2023-01-04 00:13:25] <CorgoPupper> Most of Sennheiser's 600 line need powerful amps
[2023-01-04 00:13:32] <Ro4r_> duo streaming setups are crazy if it comes to audio
[2023-01-04 00:13:40] <+EzPickenz1> Can you run headphones thru dac and stream thru XLR
[2023-01-04 00:13:42] <%wubnoxious> mine are 250ohm and needs high power
[2023-01-04 00:13:48] <AnthonyHomie69> scroll down on that windows window
[2023-01-04 00:13:52] <+LtSloth> ay yp, papa Klean???
[2023-01-04 00:14:08] <dededsoul> the beyerdynamic requires even more power
[2023-01-04 00:14:21] <%ekozaur> @Klean GoXLR supports like 50Ohm headphoners
[2023-01-04 00:14:25] <AnthonyHomie69> open the game and make sure its going through the one you want on the game in this window
[2023-01-04 00:14:33] <%wubnoxious> Pog thats cool

[2023-01-04 00:27:47] <%wubnoxious> @Klean I would choose Binaural or spatial, not both. dont want to process audio twice

[2023-01-04 00:31:48] <SeeraX2> WTF that underground sound
[2023-01-04 00:31:54] <+Masterbob122> Sounded like a water drum
[2023-01-04 00:31:59] <+giant_mungus> The spatial audio def seems better, but the EQ is a mess
[2023-01-04 00:32:02] <%+zerodark_met> blacked head too lol
[2023-01-04 00:32:13] <+Technical_13> yeah i know

[2023-01-04 00:32:26] <+Technical_13> i get that fish bowl sound too
[2023-01-04 00:32:26] <%ekozaur> One scav I heard behind you, but he popped out in front of you...
[2023-01-04 00:32:30] <%wubnoxious> im telling you try with binural off my dude
[2023-01-04 00:32:31] <%Ravejeuit> maybe in ears
[2023-01-04 00:32:39] <SavagePinecone_> the echo sounds like 7.1 surround sound
[2023-01-04 00:32:40] <porkguzzler> @Klean do you have any issues with your KP9? I've read alot of negative things about kusa lately
[2023-01-04 00:32:44] <trapys> maybe he doesnt notice it..... you know, being deaf and all that
[2023-01-04 00:32:53] <+NeishyK> @giant_mungus is it possible to change the eq
[2023-01-04 00:32:54] <+Masterbob122> Are you not talking about the bugged binural double sound?
[2023-01-04 00:32:59] <%5__hp> a cleaner sound is probably better for locating enemys
[2023-01-04 00:33:08] <+flaymonthegamer> one thing i like about dts ultra is it gets rid of that loud ambient noise
[2023-01-04 00:33:08] <%+RaijinTDM> got my new gpu, hopefully i dont drop as many frames lol
[2023-01-04 00:33:15] <%Freckles619> either Audio Input Capture or Audio Output Capture on OBS but not both
[2023-01-04 00:33:15] <@%SpottedTango> @Klean I don't know what hte magic here is supposed to be, but imo; raw unfiltered stereo is going to sound more natural than any digital effects crap.

[2023-01-04 00:33:40] <porkguzzler> How many rounds have you put through it?
[2023-01-04 00:33:52] <+lucent_penumbra> I like the Hoyt back there, Klean
[2023-01-04 00:34:30] <%Ayomeer> @SpottedTango Hutch's mod, an audio engineer recommended this, and in his demo video it did sound good. That's why we're lending credence here
[2023-01-04 00:34:42] <%Citro49> I have about 1000 rounds through my KP-9 and it has been almost perfect so far, suppressed and non suppressed
[2023-01-04 00:34:45] <Bmx_lang> @klean wasn't there a setting in the new program you chanced earlier? changed it to spacious or something?

[2023-01-04 00:35:11] <trapys> @SpottedTango I could see it removing everything being in your ear drum and, like a fish bowl, seperating it further out. Thus having a better time to locaate the sounds. Usually though, i also hate sound processing with a passion ^^

[2023-01-04 00:35:55] <+flaymonthegamer> its easier to locate sound with it on when its off it sounds like all the sounds are combined in one area
[2023-01-04 00:35:56] <@%SpottedTango> @Ayomeer it blows my mind that any audio engineer is recommending a software FX package over a true EQ, but OK. I'm just a roadie.

[2023-01-04 00:36:46] <%Ayomeer> @SpottedTango I'm no expert, but I don't think it's an EQ per se, but a decoder that's supposed to work with the encoding the occulus audio uses specifically
[2023-01-04 00:36:47] <Deltaros> Yes
[2023-01-04 00:36:48] <trapys> yeah

[2023-01-04 00:38:25] <trapys> @SpottedTango agreed
[2023-01-04 00:38:29] <ICOnlyBlue> i hear the audio supper compressed. Hmm
[2023-01-04 00:38:32] <%Gunning_Wild> could be 2 scavs with same gun messing with us

[2023-01-04 00:39:35] <+Money_LEGACY> HOW YOU GET ULTRA?
[2023-01-04 00:39:36] <%holyfrenzyoffline> ultra is the best of both look like
[2023-01-04 00:39:37] <trapys> but also doesnt give you the direction that headphone seems to give
[2023-01-04 00:39:40] <ICOnlyBlue> when it comes to directional audio i will assume there is a compression applied
[2023-01-04 00:39:41] <AyCheck> subjective*
[2023-01-04 00:39:42] <SeeraX2> Ultra keeps the spacialness and open audio
[2023-01-04 00:39:47] <dededsoul> ultra sounds wide af Kreygasm
[2023-01-04 00:40:15] <+TheSaltSlingingHasher> how did you get an utlra option? I only have the one
[2023-01-04 00:40:17] <@%SpottedTango> I'm hearing this through crap laptop speakers anyway. But I personally don't like any of the filters. However, if it helps you with spacial positioning, more power to you!
[2023-01-04 00:40:21] <%wubnoxious> well it really depends on how chat is listening to this, if you are listening to it from phone speakers its probably fine KEKW through my monitors it sounds bad
[2023-01-04 00:40:31] <%Gunning_Wild> me too
[2023-01-04 00:40:45] <%Gunning_Wild> it gives that fake idea of things beeing way further
[2023-01-04 00:40:56] <Chris114> ultra
[2023-01-04 00:40:59] <%RollerMobbed> Ultra sounds closer to off. The other two sound super compressed/digitized
[2023-01-04 00:41:04] <%+RaijinTDM> ultra sounds the best in my headset
[2023-01-04 00:41:09] <takeyourb3> that sounds the least muffled so far besides off
[2023-01-04 00:41:12] <xTOF_BE> Off or Ultra yes
[2023-01-04 00:41:14] <trapys> @Gunning_Wild would kinda work, since tarkov makes everything in your eardrums lol
[2023-01-04 00:41:15] <%+RaijinTDM> and im  using surround sound audio

[2023-01-04 00:41:47] <@%SpottedTango> I got 9/21 on veritas's test, so clearly audio and me in this game aren't thinking the same thing.

[2023-01-04 00:42:03] <Chadivore> @SpottedTango you're thinking about the test wrong
[2023-01-04 00:42:07] <SevenTruths> Sent that one somewhere LUL
[2023-01-04 00:42:13] <%Gunning_Wild> @Gunning_Wild I guess sound design is always the  worst in most games. think its hard to do right
[2023-01-04 00:42:16] <trapys> @porkguzzler i think so too
[2023-01-04 00:42:21] <Chadivore> I talked to veritas about the test yesterday, I  can say you will be surprised with the results video
[2023-01-04 00:42:31] <+lucent_penumbra> @MidgetOnSteroids it's a setting in the offline mode
[2023-01-04 00:42:34] <porkguzzler> @porkguzzler Right? it's alot more fluid
[2023-01-04 00:42:55] <%+MidgetOnSteroids> lol oh @lucent_penumbra
[2023-01-04 00:43:12] <@%SpottedTango> @Klean on the right, go to additional device properties in that spacial sound window
[2023-01-04 00:43:22] <ICOnlyBlue> so the difference is compression to appear less surrounding and more direct. It removes the eco basically. @Klean So it should be better with that on.

[2023-01-04 00:44:06] <SeeraX2> I feel like I have to test all 4 options for few hours sessions. To know which one works best for EFT.

[2023-01-04 00:44:14] <Chadivore> He actually determined Binaural does nothing with Occulsion audio. There was no difference in any of the sounds in the test. I mean it's hard to explain, but he kind of did a trick. :D Not his fault though. But yeah, just watch out for the results video.
[2023-01-04 00:44:35] <fake_fantasy> ultra kills the ambience almost
[2023-01-04 00:44:37] <%wubnoxious> I just feel having binural on while testing these will confuse you
[2023-01-04 00:44:37] <ImJWoo> @Klean try turing off Audio Enhancements under Additional Device Properties?

[2023-01-04 00:46:14] <%RollerMobbed> But this is kind of dumb if you think about it, that you’d have to use spatial audio to get reasonable audio in an FPS game
[2023-01-04 00:46:15] <%Gunning_Wild> sounds really good
[2023-01-04 00:46:22] <%+youngdadgod> @SeeraX2 Is it the "DTS sound unbound"?

[2023-01-04 00:47:39] <AnthonyHomie69> @Klean Pretty sure Hutch is using the other app version you are using DTS Sound Bound and he is using DTS Headphone:X v1 app i think? i wonder if it makes a difference

[2023-01-04 00:47:41] <+EzPickenz1> ultra is probably a Motherboard feature

[2023-01-04 00:49:30] <Chadivore> DTS Headphone: X v2.0 is a spatial sound software that can work on any set of headphones. The v2.0 is the newer and more advanced version of DTS Headphone: X. It includes new features such as enhanced bass rendering and audio clarity. Plus, it improved proximity cues, and lossless Hi-Res audio support compared to the first version.

[2023-01-04 00:56:30] <%ekozaur> I don't know man, directionality comes from the game. No amount of EQ or software can change that. It can filter out sounds in different frequencies, but directionality? That's game engine...

[2023-01-04 01:47:50] <leflavius_nl> @leflavius_nl AYAYAYA lol that one was hella cool

[2023-01-04 01:48:08] <Two_Hands> Loved using the SR-2M in BF3. I think it was called the PP-2000 in that game.
[2023-01-04 01:48:12] <%siddo__> @jadod81111 you realise he had close to a thousand raids last wipe right? probably more than 90% of players

[2023-01-04 02:47:27] <0_FREEZER_0> Genuinely curious, did it start as a roblox game? or just coincidental?
[2023-01-04 02:48:07] <%MxHolmes> @IBigIBruce Its on Steam, titled Battlebit Remastered. For the test today, you need to be in their discord, and have your steam and discord linked

[2023-01-04 02:48:13] <WasilaVera> yeah being available to a lot of people is a huge W plus cheap once released
[2023-01-04 02:48:19] <cancerous_reply> Chat battlebit playtest in 15 min just reminder
[2023-01-04 02:48:22] <%+Bogash> Any flaws?

[2023-01-04 02:48:39] <WasilaVera> @Bogash 127vs127 is pretty hectic
[2023-01-04 02:48:50] <%MxHolmes> You completely let go of the graphics once youre in
[2023-01-04 02:48:53] <%holyfrenzyoffline> its the true battlefield right now
[2023-01-04 02:49:04] <cancerous_reply> I prefer the 64x64 over 127, its way too many angles getting shot from
[2023-01-04 02:49:12] <+TheZissou> How're you liking the new wipe so far @Klean ?
[2023-01-04 02:49:20] <cancerous_reply> but if they manage to make bigger maps the 127 could be pretty decent
[2023-01-04 02:49:24] <+greatestunpaid> downloadingnow
[2023-01-04 02:49:28] <+herlandark> Don't let the lego graphics get into your mind

[2023-01-04 02:51:14] <cancerous_reply> Chat first time i tried battlebit i got mad from being killed after spawning all the time, just remind yourself to choose a good spawn so you dont instantly die all the time
[2023-01-04 02:51:15] <nsn_strike> are you using freelook to prevent ADS zoom?
[2023-01-04 02:51:25] <+Spartan_089> games like battlebit are the ones I would happily give $60 to just to support them

[2023-01-04 02:54:47] <%MxHolmes> @cancerous_reply Yes it is, thats why in the 127v127 mode its not 128, because the server needs the extra slot to run it

[2023-01-04 03:13:06] <Czech___Mate> @Czech___Mate I mean from what I understand, the binaural is good as this Hutchs boy said, on his true full surround it works but its not translated into stereo you have with headphones and this DTS program basically does the surround -> stereo translation

[2023-01-04 04:11:00] <%+kushhmt> @altezza300 how did you make it out in time those things so damn heavy
[2023-01-04 04:11:06] <WildWolfMax> @kushhmt I do enjoy the uncertainty of meeting other scavs not knowing whether to trust them, like my friend got told by a guy that there is a sledgehammer around the corner because he couldn't fit it in the slick, wouldn't know otherwise
[2023-01-04 04:11:55] <+Zendule> when settings say release how is that different than press?
[2023-01-04 04:12:04] <%+altezza300> @kushhmt it was on the street near the UN roadblock extract. nobody was in the raid at that point so I just dropped my stuff grabbed it and left
[2023-01-04 04:12:15] <JASONEIGHT> input isn't registered until the key is released
[2023-01-04 04:12:15] <%+kushhmt> @wildwolfmax yeah thats true makes it so unique instead of shoot everything
[2023-01-04 04:12:20] <%+altezza300> had like 50 seconds left in the raid by the end
[2023-01-04 04:12:20] <Goldie_Gun> @Zendule inputs on rlease of the key
[2023-01-04 04:12:21] <Krelekar> @Zendule because its on release of the button instead of the press

[2023-01-04 04:18:58] <+popps375> @klean is there anyway I can send a name and a clip to anyone about cheaters dude this guy literally just rolled up on me with no info and pre-fired me walking over a hill to me. I have a clip but I know the report button in the game isn't worth shit and the report system on their cite is even worse is there anything us in the community can do?
[2023-01-04 04:18:59] <%midnightoozaru> the audio is so deceptive
[2023-01-04 04:19:00] <+Greenly123> also in a bush

[2023-01-04 04:19:12] <%+KARMERICAN> i love this
[2023-01-04 04:19:15] <+Typehigh> nothing wrong with this playstyle when he goes up against multiple with better gear, it's the right way

[2023-01-04 04:19:48] <%midnightoozaru> if he looted the crate, you should have heard it
[2023-01-04 04:19:48] <+marrentv> @Spacejamming seems like rat playstyle because he's sneaking around and surprise attacking. Chad playstyle would be run in there guns ablazing
[2023-01-04 04:19:55] <baroli62> do you still have anxiety in these situations?

[2023-01-04 04:56:29] <%+cykaq49> @NicoIsntHere That pretty buggy on DayZ, you can see it brightly in the dark, tarkov devs can't fix the glasses, I imagine it would be harder for them to implement it lol

[2023-01-04 05:29:49] <%+mahhndo> @Gogh Well having things open while playing Tarkov does suck resource off your PC. Klean probably has stuff open just for streaming. When we play its just the game and maybe like Discord on the side.
[2023-01-04 05:29:59] <D8J_TV> @Gogh tarkov in general is a pretty beefy game and always has been. Prolly the other thing other then complexity that stops most players

[2023-01-04 05:53:01] <oooktony> i’m very excited about this audio fix video
[2023-01-04 05:53:03] <+Haziri_> Depends on playstyle. Early wipe you run into more players so thats one challenge. Mid wipe is less players so pvp missions little longer but can survive more

[2023-01-04 05:53:10] <D8J_TV> @t00_1337r nah i know this isn't but was thinking of prolly piking it up again soon. Wasn't sure how things get if you miss the start or if it matters at all.
[2023-01-04 05:53:24] <FishHoook> cheeki breeki time
[2023-01-04 05:53:29] <Krelekar> @Koffiekoekje i personally love it, because i always close stuff behind me for the surprise factor but it never actually did for loot. now it does
[2023-01-04 05:53:29] <+thehivemind1> @klean Since AI Scavs loot, do you think (eventually) a command to ask to trade with them would be useful?
[2023-01-04 05:53:38] <%+aamef> @D8J_TV No probs 2-3 months in to be fair. Not EVERYONE can invest tens of hours every day right after wipe.
[2023-01-04 05:53:39] <+thehivemind1> In Raid
[2023-01-04 05:53:53] <tsiigaaja> Scavs have voice lines for needing specific stuff right?
[2023-01-04 05:53:57] <tsiigaaja> Or theres UI for it at least
[2023-01-04 05:54:04] <t00_1337r> @D8J_TV Streamers kindof ruin the curve for everyone, but there is no problem at all joining at any time. The only real disadvantage you will have is not having the time in game to pick up good ammo.
[2023-01-04 05:54:26] <+Ciderbeard> is that other scav AI?

[2023-01-04 05:56:49] <%+aamef> It's chat so yes
