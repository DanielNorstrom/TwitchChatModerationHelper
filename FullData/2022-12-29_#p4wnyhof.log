[2022-12-29 12:57:14] <tabrabi> @y0uw1shttv @y0uw1shttv between the Hungarian streamers most of them stream in Hungarian, because their viewerbase is Hungarian. But there are a few people who stream in both languages (like 2-4 days Hungarian, 1-3 days English), and there are even a very limited number of Hungarian streamers only talking in Enlglish in their streams. So I would also advise you to just use the language that you are most comfortable with during streaming
