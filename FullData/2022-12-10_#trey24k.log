[2022-12-10 16:42:41] <+velawlciraptor> @essentialservice_tv it wont identify cheaters but I guess they could see people flying around or having a 50:1 KD
[2022-12-10 16:42:42] <+eesa> rogues no clipping smh
[2022-12-10 16:42:42] <+greymck> is there a new event?
[2022-12-10 16:42:42] <+sevynnreloaded> i feel like dying to cheaters never gets so bad you need to cheat back lmao
[2022-12-10 16:42:42] <kugelstifterli> if that existed the detection rate of anti cheats would be 100%
[2022-12-10 16:42:44] <RadiatedBaconBits> if there was a cheat where you could see only cheaters that would be the best anti cheat software you could have... so no there is no such thing
[2022-12-10 16:42:47] <YogurtEnema> if there were a cheat to see all the cheaters, then BSG would fix said problem
[2022-12-10 16:42:47] <%kingebreezus54> People cheat it’s life🤷🏾‍♂️ n people always will cuz they want an advantage especially if they give up on trying to be good at the game

[2022-12-10 17:25:19] <grimrepair69> rfb needs better recoil control

[2022-12-10 17:25:37] <t3rribl3gam3man> That’s like 70k
[2022-12-10 17:25:38] <landonplayzgames> i have a feeling hes going to get the sr25 then die instantly

[2022-12-10 17:26:26] <+Velinatorr> RFB and M80 is my shit early wipe
[2022-12-10 17:26:27] <+InY0f4c3> I also think people may know, but still have gear fear....so they scale down to RFB
[2022-12-10 17:26:27] <+ya_i_did> RFB is my go too at the begining of wipe..
[2022-12-10 17:26:36] <%RatedBud> @bitsyrain yeah it is
[2022-12-10 17:26:37] <%NAIL_NIALL> It's only worth it earlier in the wipe when you don't have access to SR etc from traders
[2022-12-10 17:26:50] <bifrost03> YOu're talking about enter in raid with better gear than have better survival chance?
[2022-12-10 17:26:53] <rnadys> my friend played the game to the point where he got kappa once I gave him a sr25 when he first got the game

[2022-12-10 17:27:15] <Zunami43> Didn't we use rfb early wipe because it's the first gun that could use m80? before m80 got moved to later traders

[2022-12-10 17:32:17] <+tstoner777> i feel like lapua is its own category ... and shouldnt be compared in the convo we're having.. right?
[2022-12-10 17:32:20] <%renji_tv> I feel like they need to balance weapons towards being better instead of making the good stuff work
[2022-12-10 17:32:23] <+Sesleri> scar H, mutant, RD, black MDR

[2022-12-10 17:32:45] <Lslukeren> Imagine if the lapua was available for everyone
[2022-12-10 17:32:49] <Rabid_Nut> VERY TRUE
[2022-12-10 17:32:52] <%$PirelliCondoms> really, we just need better armor

[2022-12-10 17:33:19] <+POLO_5021> the issue is, everyone will complain and moan if say BP for example is nerfed, in either pen or damage
[2022-12-10 17:33:23] <%$TheHanRoach> Dude im so sad nesting time is done

[2022-12-10 17:36:31] <RadiatedBaconBits> they need to add all the actual bullet stats to the game, put it into perspective for all players..
[2022-12-10 17:36:36] <rnadys> i think gsh's, comtac and m32
[2022-12-10 17:36:44] <t3rribl3gam3man> Is mosin overrated or underrated???
[2022-12-10 17:36:51] <%RatedBud> online or offline?
[2022-12-10 17:36:51] <peregrine_x> would 300 be more popular if you could get more of the ammo? it seems like the ammo has similarities to 762.39 but has 50% more rpm
