[2022-12-19 00:16:52] <@%^Nightbot> I know ads suck, but I will be donating ad revenue in the form of PC's, consoles, peripherals, etc. to members of my community who can't afford them on their own. Subs do not have to watch any ads.

[2022-12-19 14:44:47] <justanormalguywatchingu> @hardknock2 when is that
[2022-12-19 14:44:51] <dot857ag> just hit diamond
[2022-12-19 14:44:54] <imbirdman_> In the spring or summer
[2022-12-19 14:44:56] <nuudez> So ESA quald for sure and then I think the other teams got in based off points. Now the teams that didn’t qualify based off points still have a chance to go in SPLIT 2
[2022-12-19 14:44:57] <bubbleduddle> btw guys, how many HP in one shield cell? Arond 20 i guess?

[2022-12-19 14:45:50] <%breezyysupreme> Wait till wattson rolls him, youll see
[2022-12-19 14:45:52] <nuudez> @imbirdman_ That I’m not sure off but it shouldn’t be too long. I think they give a lil time to practice and such and then continue with split 2 maybe a week or 2 after this one ended

[2022-12-19 15:00:24] <QuaternionsBhop> on average yes, but on an individual basis probably not
[2022-12-19 15:00:27] <@%xCausinChaosx> for his time h'd be smart

[2022-12-19 15:00:53] <KMac_25> Washington said in 1778 that we shouldnt have a two party system

[2022-12-19 15:00:59] <+LudaChrisly> @HisWattson the FDA had to tell people not to eat Tidepods or make chicken with Nyquil, so you tell me
[2022-12-19 15:00:59] <vapor_clawzzz> internet has made people smart and way dumber ar the same time lol

[2022-12-19 15:01:06] <Acolet> we have more access to knowledge
[2022-12-19 15:01:08] <SlimGeezus_> I would think with the development of tech yes we get smarter

[2022-12-19 15:01:39] <InburnUS> I mean yes they’d be dumber. Access to knowledge and more ability to communicate makes us intellectually much smarter than those w/o the ability to meet people and grow their knowledge on a daily basis.

[2022-12-19 15:20:09] <@%^Nightbot> Honestly, nobody puts in as much work as TSM, they train for hours, and Hal's even working on controller so he can be even better at this game. Verhulst is literally beaming kids with his eyes closed with how much time he's put in on apex. The addition of Reps and Raven to their team just proves that they have a winning mindset and are focused on the grind. With all of this hard work and effort, they can easily secure a top 15 spot in the next ALGS, #TSMWIN

[2022-12-19 15:55:14] <colorblindkanga> @watson ….As a piece of advice. You shouldn’t accelerate into like edibles as your first experience. You should at least know what “high” feels like with a short smoke sesh before using an edible. That’s an intense high. You might get a little too anxious if you go that hard out of the gate.
[2022-12-19 15:55:21] <WhereTheGas> @DeathValleySniper nose beers are the best beers

[2022-12-19 21:03:34] <%sugurhoney> how often are ppl playing as full teams in this game vs solo queue
[2022-12-19 21:04:07] <+cougarcowboy> @syphon_ac007 lol you're an idiot. domesticated dogs can become feral. our dogs now have gone through artificial selection and they can definitely be wild
[2022-12-19 21:04:18] <backlistd> I only play this game as a full team so idk lol

[2022-12-19 21:06:08] <%sugurhoney> wild dogs arent the same as dogs that have gone feral. wild dogs are entirely different breeds like the dingo and stuff

[2022-12-19 21:08:08] <+aGnote> DansGame no shampoo?
[2022-12-19 21:08:14] <+jyvcs> well yeah shampoo strips natural oils

[2022-12-19 21:08:45] <%sugurhoney> ppl do that but it takes a long time before it stops looking greasy asf
[2022-12-19 21:08:46] <+jyvcs> it becomes excessively oily at first when u stop
[2022-12-19 21:08:46] <disturbed_spine> that is indeed how that works yes shampoo is purely a marketing scam
[2022-12-19 21:08:54] <%retro__physical> you gotta brush it real good

[2022-12-19 21:09:47] <+cougarcowboy> @syphon_ac007 most dog breeds especially medium to larger breeds. I lived in Brazil for 2 years and feral dogs are all over the place
[2022-12-19 21:09:48] <%sugurhoney> it can take like at least a year for ur hair to do that
[2022-12-19 21:10:16] <gsimproved> Big Soap is going to assassinate that man

[2022-12-19 21:17:38] <%retro__physical> My favorite character is the reaper guy. he is very powerfull. special move, honestly is one of the best in the game and so he comes equipped with these two revolvers and only takes about 3 or 4 shots to actually execute a kill so it comes really in handy specially when you come from the side.
