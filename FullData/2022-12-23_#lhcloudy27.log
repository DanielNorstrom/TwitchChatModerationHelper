[2022-12-23 14:06:05] <+Xeffary> i just want it to do consistent damage, but when there's the chance of hitting rng headshots they cant up it's base damage
[2022-12-23 14:06:07] <+Xeffary> which is more consistent
[2022-12-23 14:06:09] <%GIRLinMaleBody> they changed the omnic form m1. They said it will do big dmg from close range but bad dmg from long range, rn it does the same amount of dmg

[2022-12-23 17:26:28] <hijaudragon> yeah
[2022-12-23 17:26:38] <Cavalryarcher> the 27 is because he was born in 1927
[2022-12-23 17:26:46] <abxc3> damn he is rein irl?
[2022-12-23 17:26:47] <kaifurra> @lhcloudy27 Hello!  Did you know that if you use the ramattra block while looking up at the sky, then you will reduce the fall damage in Sigma's ultimate by 2 times?  (I used a translator, I hope you understand what I mean)
[2022-12-23 17:26:54] <+Wh00pSid3iZi> 27 stands for 27 years old

[2022-12-23 17:27:49] <%MintJamz> Because the damage has a direction
[2022-12-23 17:27:54] <beissi555> prolly the ult drops dmg on ur head from top and goes thru shields
