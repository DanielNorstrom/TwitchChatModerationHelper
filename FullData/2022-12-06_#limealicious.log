[2022-12-06 00:47:38] <%+Fridurmus> I must not cringe. Cringe is the mind-killer. Cringe is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my cringe. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past, I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the cringe has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.
