[2023-01-03 16:41:41] <@%Iron_Blood> If everyone is playing UR murtide, we should just jam cavern of souls in this deck
[2023-01-03 16:41:42] <$RealKoman> Spike, do you think your Neobrand list is good to take to an FNM?
[2023-01-03 16:41:42] <chad_mountain> I mean passing doesnt solve op having 3 counterspells?
[2023-01-03 16:41:50] <+benitar_oxford> Opponents hand was Walls Maria, Rose, and Sina. Real tough to get through.
[2023-01-03 16:41:57] <%Goody_Phil> Those turns were good I think. I think once opp got lands we maybe had to force their hand

[2023-01-03 16:42:34] <%+dravencorvinus> Sorry i wasn't beating you up Spike, my point was it was highly likely they had a lot of interaction and you weren't winning that one anyway
[2023-01-03 16:42:35] <+mista_wyan> The turn where they had up 2 mana and you untapped probably should have been a turn of rockrik followed up by justice strike when they counter rockrik first right?

[2023-01-03 18:36:37] <@%Marvoleath> @Vernash_ it used to be separate triggers for exiling and returning, since it is the same ability with delayed relation, the thing is never exiled if the enchantment is removed before the exile trigger resolves

[2023-01-03 18:38:09] <%Nuclerchckn> What’s up spike? Happy new year 🥳🥳
[2023-01-03 18:38:15] <%+Mastaalucard> @Vernash_ old effect : 2 different triggers. one exiles and one returns. new effect : only one trigger that lasts as long as thing is on battlefield. since thing goes away immediately trigger immediately ends (before it starts)
[2023-01-03 18:38:26] <halfinchhammr> I see an iron  crag feat and my interest is peaked
[2023-01-03 18:38:40] <%3udiamonia> did they see the irencrag in the graveyard last game?
[2023-01-03 18:38:41] <%zMagnus> @aspiringspike have you tried dredge cards in your r/g breach storm lists?
[2023-01-03 18:38:47] <+tenorless420> @Vernash_ basically, each paragraph is considered a single effect. Because newer cards are one paragraph, the leaving and entering of the permanent are checked with the same trigger. It returning no longer makes a separate trigger
[2023-01-03 18:39:13] <%$cropdustr> @Vernash_ one-paragraph effects specify a duration of "until this permanent leaves the battlefield". If the binding is removed before its trigger resolves, the specified duration for that effect has already expired, so the targeted permanent never gets exiled.

[2023-01-03 18:39:36] <Vernash_> Thank you chat <3
[2023-01-03 18:39:53] <%+Mastaalucard> @Vernash_ here's the rule, specifically : 611.2b Some continuous effects generated by the resolution of a spell or ability have durations worded “for as long as . . . .” If the “for as long as” duration never starts, or it ends before the moment the effect would first be applied, the effect does nothing. It doesn’t start and immediately stop again, and it doesn’t last forever.
[2023-01-03 18:39:54] <Vernash_> Huh, portable hole is one paragraph as well, neat

[2023-01-03 18:40:37] <%fjork3> skyclave apparition notably isn't, but that's because it's using info about the exiled card when it comes back
[2023-01-03 18:40:59] <%$cropdustr> old-templated o-ring effects with two specific triggers have what are called "linked" triggered abilities. If you blow up o-ring in response to the trigger, the "return it to the battlefield" trigger will go on the stack and happen, but then the linked exile effect will resolve after. Since the linked return trigger has already happened, there's nothing to ever bring the targeted permanent back
