[2022-12-17 00:02:10] <Buszok> why it isn't flat?
[2022-12-17 00:02:15] <Dominich> time to boot up FlightSim!
[2022-12-17 00:02:19] <+DalSte> We had a big rain yesterday
[2022-12-17 00:02:23] <%aundros> now, if that booster can survive the storm without falling over, that is impressive
[2022-12-17 00:02:29] <%aundros> probably massive swells
[2022-12-17 00:02:35] <$BadgerMk1> can't see radar, it's outside radar coverage
[2022-12-17 00:02:35] <RoninStorm> best ever.

[2022-12-17 00:02:53] <%Sanduckchan> water has heavy impact on radio
[2022-12-17 00:02:54] <sideshow_bob_420> They have 7 landing locations they can choose from.. they choose it based off of weather predictions usually
[2022-12-17 00:02:59] <+ouchie_1> might be the cause of the delays?
[2022-12-17 00:03:07] <$BadgerMk1> well done SpaceX Clap

[2022-12-17 22:38:38] <+Hatemodsminecraft> it's not lightning, its beacon on booster going down. The debris was from booster as well
[2022-12-17 22:38:38] <+xDeadBringerx> The amazing this is that this booster was first used May 30th 2020. They launched it 15 times in 2.5 years.

[2022-12-17 22:39:06] <+Hino_ken> Deposition is when a substance in gas form changes states to become a solid. @Giantwaffle

[2022-12-17 22:39:43] <+Mibbido> What are they actually testing right now Waffle?
[2022-12-17 22:39:43] <+Hino_ken> The gaseous substance gets deposited (usually as crystals) bypassing the intermediate liquid state. An example of deposition is when water vapor in the atmosphere changes directly into ice, such as the formation of frost.

[2022-12-17 22:45:24] <%Butterwhales> in 2009 two russian satlites colided dunpealhunter87 waffleHmm didn't hear about the other one. Yes there are worries and it is being taken into consideration when companies seek to put things into orbit
[2022-12-17 22:45:25] <%lange__> Wait speed and velocity?
[2022-12-17 22:45:28] <%Chilled_Voodoo> @Giantwaffle are you done with rings of saturn?
[2022-12-17 22:45:29] <%$frainsbreeze> speed and velocity??
[2022-12-17 22:45:34] <MiczuPL> yes, that's how physics work when you land
[2022-12-17 22:45:35] <sdadsaad> kinda it's painful to think that people in future will fight corporations for place on orbit and right to use it still questionable for solely profit
[2022-12-17 22:45:40] <+orillion> YEP successful aslong as it lands exploding after is fine
[2022-12-17 22:45:40] <HurricaneHenry> Velocity is speed
[2022-12-17 22:45:48] <+Face_32> physics are a 3d only thingk?

[2022-12-17 22:45:59] <%Rool_Gonzalez> lateral and vertical velocity?
[2022-12-17 22:46:04] <@%$Apparentthreat> the swing you have to do at the beginning is the hard part
