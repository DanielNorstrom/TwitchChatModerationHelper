[2022-12-08 16:43:26] <makki2chigi> It’s the shell that matters. Persist for example is non legendary. Which creates a shell that makes archon the best

I have noticed the opponent has a nonland permanent with CMC 1 or less on their side of the board. Did you consider using Archmage's Charm's "gain control" mode? Thanks

[2022-12-08 18:29:59] <@%+ItsSimonDS> @Bassnj hitting a land drop every turn is not what UW needs
[2022-12-08 18:30:19] <%Aquinas9> @d0gula I suppose it is 4 color control, given W&6, Omnath, and red SB cards. But the term 'UW' control is meaningful to me because it means the deck plays Archmage's Charm, a card you don't see in 4C elementals/control decks.

[2022-12-08 18:31:25] <%Aquinas9> @Bassnj Making a land drop every single turn is PRECISELY what your UW control deck needs. If the deck starts missing land drops it falls apart extremely fast. You can cover this need with Archmage's Charm / Memory Deluge, or W&6 answers it forever for juist 2 mana.
[2022-12-08 18:31:27] <%Bassnj> @Bassnj No, obviously that is good but UW doesn't need late game inevitability nor does it need a reason to tap out on turn two every game. UW is lacking stronger more efficient answers  to problematic threats

[2022-12-08 18:41:48] <floppaposting> you need a 4080 to even hit 30fps with the new rtx
[2022-12-08 18:41:50] <rowrow_> portal without the charm of half life models?

[2022-12-08 18:44:17] <FrothyOmen> spike since you're using a 3070 can you use RTX voice? it will make all your breathing, swallowing, and desk tapping sounds completely silent
[2022-12-08 18:44:19] <ryyyyyyye> Lowkey - if they stole the springleaf drum that turns off casting the rest of your daredevils

[2022-12-08 18:57:11] <wavelink17> @aspiringspike I thought it was due to food poisoning LUL
[2022-12-08 18:57:14] <+HOBOMASTERMAN> I mean, the creature is the one eating the food
[2022-12-08 18:57:16] <ccr_grindcast> it's also flavorful because they eat the poison food thereby dealing 6 to themselves
[2022-12-08 18:57:29] <Poco_the_turtle> you can shoot your own creature but that's about it
[2022-12-08 18:57:31] <LoganTheBard> right - food poisioning was my thought too
[2022-12-08 18:57:33] <%Bambino430> I've always thought the flavor was Food gains 3 life, you are saccing 2 food to poison the creature, which is 6 damage
[2022-12-08 18:57:34] <LoganTheBard> they puke themselves to death
[2022-12-08 18:57:39] <@%Squee_GoblinNabob> there's a video with some wotc design guy talking about it, I forget who it was
[2022-12-08 18:57:39] <+tomdon0783> see, i thought asmo was just throwing 2 hot pies at the enemy each time
[2022-12-08 18:57:39] <%+OzymandiasFire> That is part of the reason. Also for the flavor of eating then dying
[2022-12-08 18:57:42] <%+andykv> @HOBOMASTERMAN I still wouldn't consider it self-harm to eat some bad food
[2022-12-08 18:57:43] <%+XakkAttack> @aspiringspike it was mentioned on the mothership that the name was too long to use in the text box agaon
[2022-12-08 18:57:45] <@%n0b34ts> Asmo isn't shitting the creatures pants, the creature is shitting their own pants from the food. Jeez, Chat. Get your lore right.
[2022-12-08 18:57:45] <+rectalslurpee> the flavor of the creature dealing dmg to itself from the food is cool too
[2022-12-08 18:57:46] <AlwaysForceStorm> so if we had the spear on a large co structure we could have it damage itself to gain 6?
[2022-12-08 18:57:48] <%aprilturtles> its not food poison it's overeating; you should only eat 1 food... eating 2 foods makes you die

[2022-12-08 18:58:05] <Criomedes> @Bambino430 the flavor in the 6 damage is asmo cooks for Lord of the Pit which is a 7/7 so asmo doesnt kill him
