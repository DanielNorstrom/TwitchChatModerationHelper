[2022-12-17 00:05:12] <Subconscious__> On top of companies being a lot more on top of harassment and what goes on in their work place, they should also not name characters after people from their company in  the event things like this come out lsubcoSip BibleThump

[2022-12-17 00:05:18] <%+MALYG0S> The Story was awesome, but the way that they went about it was wrong
[2022-12-17 00:05:19] <@%Grimstab77> Let's go
[2022-12-17 00:05:28] <UndeadGraduate> it being free now means people make accounts, play the 50 games and then sell them to cheaters as ready to play comp accts'

[2022-12-17 00:07:05] <UndeadGraduate> there were gm players put in bronze 5 as a bug
[2022-12-17 00:07:13] <UndeadGraduate> it was awful
[2022-12-17 00:07:19] <@%Grimstab77> Yeah but we were playing against the same players after all. Since everyone got downgraded, GM players were still playing against GM. Even if it was diamond under our name
[2022-12-17 00:07:33] <@%Grimstab77> @UndeadGraduate that was a fun bug tho LUL
[2022-12-17 00:07:49] <UndeadGraduate> more games need to do hard elo resets

[2022-12-17 22:52:58] <+BetrayedFoxy> Yeah Blizzard publicly announced that there was a bug causing players to get placed way lower than they should've been. I doubt it's being resolved but with the new system you only ever place once so . . .
