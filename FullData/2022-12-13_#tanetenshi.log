[2022-12-13 09:54:26] <%Alternate480> Yeah, like I said, That's Just my opinion tho. And I think that's because I had SO many Bad Experiences with those two restaurants where i lived.
[2022-12-13 09:54:30] <%karia_the_male_maid> that makes a new meaning to "road to hell"
[2022-12-13 09:54:48] <skagtheprinceofhell> @xxnegativeoccam Shouldn't. Burger King is literally about the burgers so should still cost more.

[2022-12-13 09:55:25] <%Alternate480> How's your Subway? I think it's ok here. At least where I live.
[2022-12-13 09:55:30] <skagtheprinceofhell> Are the Canadian Burger King burgers smaller then double your hand size?
[2022-12-13 09:55:40] <%ZillaOmega> ill give you special sauce pantsGrab

[2022-12-13 09:55:49] <Pokke_chan> In general if you don't want to get food poison or taste any "special sauce" better just cook your own food I guess.
[2022-12-13 09:55:50] <%ZillaOmega> also ive NEVER seen a subway with a drivethrough
[2022-12-13 09:56:28] <%InfernoZtorm> How about a Diablo Roast Beef from Arby's?
[2022-12-13 09:56:36] <%ZillaOmega> nah i feel you sensei taneHEADPAT
[2022-12-13 09:56:37] <skagtheprinceofhell> Our Subway has a drive through on Hawaii. Most don't but that's because they are usually in smaller areas.
[2022-12-13 09:56:43] <%InfernoZtorm> I personally don't mind it.
[2022-12-13 09:57:03] <%Alternate480> I also went to Firehouse Subs and I thought their Sub Sandwiches were good.
[2022-12-13 09:57:03] <skagtheprinceofhell> There was. Like the Halo Mnt Dew collabs.
[2022-12-13 09:57:06] <%ZillaOmega> arby's is.....ok lol
[2022-12-13 09:57:13] <%PanzerPanda99> I love Arbys, but a lot of them closed in my area
[2022-12-13 09:57:17] <skagtheprinceofhell> Never tried. Probably taste fine.
[2022-12-13 09:57:19] <%Alternate480> I think so

[2022-12-13 09:58:39] <%+ja_chuche> the animal style fries are the best
[2022-12-13 09:58:40] <%Alternate480> I Just had a WhataBurger Bulit in my area. It's SO Good!
[2022-12-13 09:58:55] <Pokke_chan> In and out is good but not that good worth to wait in a long line for.
[2022-12-13 09:58:58] <%PanzerPanda99> Working at a hotel I get asked all the time by people coming in where the nearest In and Out is

[2022-12-13 09:59:10] <skagtheprinceofhell> My favorite pizza shop is this local shop called Pizza Ala Slice. The old man who runs it makes like 2 inch thick pizza with garlic butter drenched crispy crust and fluffy bread.
[2022-12-13 09:59:16] <%xxNegativeOccam> i tried that Wahlburgers place, its not bad, but its def overpriced

[2022-12-13 10:06:57] <skagtheprinceofhell> Titanfall servers still up for 2. But full of hackers so people use private servers.

[2022-12-13 10:36:19] <skagtheprinceofhell> Because DMC was made from a test build of RE4.
[2022-12-13 10:36:22] <%Alternate480> What did you think of the Wii U when it was around? Despite it not getting a lot of sales, I thought it was great.

[2022-12-13 10:38:52] <%InfernoZtorm> Oh yeah Monster Hunter Tri on the Wii. The only game with the swimming mechanics. taneHmm (Unless I'm wrong and someone can correct me)
[2022-12-13 10:39:01] <skagtheprinceofhell> Story went from an actual Persona and FE crossover into a weird love letter to the idol industry.

[2022-12-13 10:40:43] <VoidNinjaL22> The Wii uses AV cables, so it may be difficult to capture footage.

[2022-12-13 10:41:31] <skagtheprinceofhell> I liked dark skin Chie and not Yukiko in the game where you see from multiple medical peoples perspective like dark skin Chie is a ambulance first responder and such.

[2022-12-13 11:27:42] <VoidNinjaL22> Hunnie Pop 2 was much of the same as the first game, Kyu's dialogue got a huge upgrade though.
