[2023-01-05 11:04:53] <gonssalo_m> id rather get baby Zidane sbc tbh. Its his best version imo + the 94 has such bad stam
[2023-01-05 11:04:55] <%+Atartico> hopefully hes max 1.3
[2023-01-05 11:04:59] <palhetas81> in Portugal they talk about Enzo for 90M + zyiech + fofana loan + andrey loan
[2023-01-05 11:05:01] <ItsJonesy14> jairzinho has the p2w factor where he scored those random shots that shouldn't go in

[2023-01-05 11:06:04] <+maxmcrr> Liverpool should sign him
[2023-01-05 11:06:04] <itsRamzilla> must have about 30 players in quicksell recovery at this point.

[2023-01-05 13:14:18] <+FashionRep> Tom Stokes, a man of many talents, A FIFA pro, with old man hands. He may have some wrinkles and a bit of grey, But he plays with skill, in every single way.  With a quick mind and quick feet, Tom dominates the virtual pitch, no seat. He moves with grace, and shoots with might, Leaving his opponents in a terrible fright.

[2023-01-05 13:14:40] <%appiie3> Imo, FIFA 23 is for the footballing purists,  The passing, the movement, thinking 3-4 passes ahead to unlock a defence or find space in the midfield. You're not able to just run round players flicking your left stick.  And for that reason alone, I love it.

[2023-01-05 14:00:25] <%$fifa_format> Cheer100  @hashtag_stokes Thankyou that's really good info. Do you always get allocated to your loal server if you see low ping? Is there ever instances where you're on low ping but are on a server in timbucktoo, i played some games last WL where the ping was 18 but Literally I couldn't turn.
[2023-01-05 14:00:42] <stepbro_saelv> facing spanish or italians is the worst, always dogshit gameplay
