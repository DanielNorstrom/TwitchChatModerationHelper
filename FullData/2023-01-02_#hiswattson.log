[2023-01-02 14:53:48] <@%$turtleTiff> @mr_most_wanted so when does fridgeration occur?
[2023-01-02 14:53:52] <%+TheAttackDonkey> Frigerator or Fridgerator?
[2023-01-02 14:53:59] <X_GIRAFFE_ATTACK> it's called a refrigerator because it keeps frigerating
[2023-01-02 14:53:59] <alighieri018> @badchickentaco This is my first season, I have like 600 ranked games under my belt and I’m getting better, if it was just the last like 50 games or so I’d be 2.0

[2023-01-02 14:54:12] <+chaddyfootball> we dont call it a refrigerator
[2023-01-02 14:54:22] <mr_most_wanted> its actually from a latin word meanind cold

[2023-01-02 16:48:23] <%+Lanoyo> @spenler the difference between diamond and masters/pred is typically gamesense. Knowing what is going on in the game and what to do/where to go. You can have the best aim and movement in the game and still get fried

[2023-01-02 17:24:52] <@%thecrookthatcancook> they really should have made each of the rail buildings have a little bit of personality i think ResidentSleeper they're literally all the same
[2023-01-02 17:24:58] <thehuntsmen420> wish apex would have a map building tool like halo did imagine the maps players could come up with

[2023-01-02 17:25:13] <+khornettv> @HisWattson can be many factors that contribute to a lower performance. Even down to the power outlet not giving enough juice. From the top of my head: 1.) Check if RAM is running at high speed (3000+ MTS) 2.) Check if the problem also happens when OBS/Streamlabs is running 3.) Check for other 'bloatware' running in taskmanager and startup

[2023-01-02 18:01:31] <ronburgundy222> RDR2 one of the most interactive games of all time
[2023-01-02 18:01:33] <+Commonsens8> I love the game but can understand why some people cant play. It slower but a masterpiece non the less
[2023-01-02 18:01:36] <+missjules971> Thoughts on Elden ring?
[2023-01-02 18:01:37] <Trianthania> just dance 2017-2019 was super fun, all the games on the wii and wii u were fun as hell
[2023-01-02 18:01:37] <the_questioned_one> No
[2023-01-02 18:01:38] <u_the_jean> Yeah
[2023-01-02 18:01:40] <+YTiClips> I would pay 10k to have bo2 remastered
[2023-01-02 18:01:42] <S_Jay_Bird> FTP online games is what started it all
[2023-01-02 18:01:42] <ronburgundy222> u never had a 1000 bounty placed on ur head
[2023-01-02 18:01:44] <Gowenn> Games also had to be completed at the time of release now they are never finished even after 3 years
[2023-01-02 18:01:44] <+Warfizzle> CoD is the fifa of the fps world
[2023-01-02 18:01:44] <frost_x> then came free to play game with justified shops and then came the greedy fuckos who charge for the game and add a shop
[2023-01-02 18:01:45] <the_questioned_one> BO3 was ass
[2023-01-02 18:01:45] <VelocitySeven> Advanced Warfare was dope too
[2023-01-02 18:01:46] <%+sgtW00T> Original Metal Gear is still my all time favorite
[2023-01-02 18:01:47] <ronburgundy222> i understand
[2023-01-02 18:01:48] <ClassyOasis> BO1 was my shit
[2023-01-02 18:01:54] <%neveworley> gun game was the only good thing about COD
[2023-01-02 18:01:55] <+mang0flesh> so true

[2023-01-02 18:02:01] <spr1ngst33n> the wall running and jet packs was awesome
[2023-01-02 18:02:03] <Krazo101> People complained that CoD was stale then complained when they innovated
[2023-01-02 18:02:07] <Trianthania> plus it was one of the few games my mom would let us play that was "exercise" on the wii and was actually fun
[2023-01-02 18:02:10] <+Nerowin_22> @feyldor jrpg mostly yes sir but they are entertaining, i like grind etc but rdr 2 was just boring, every time i heard “i have a plan” i was turning it off
[2023-01-02 18:02:10] <+eldeeks> bo3 was decent

[2023-01-02 18:05:23] <%cataz_> @Doug_E_Fresh33 never played it online but i remember getting into shooters back then and that was one of the games my dad had when i was like 12-14 lol
[2023-01-02 18:05:43] <$Feyldor> PUBG was the first, I mean H1z! was and I guess we can say DAYZ but PUBG was THE battle royale, it got away with having a price tag. Now days BRs need to be free

[2023-01-02 18:06:01] <MysticNyxTv> My opinion is that the originals are the best so they should stop updating games

[2023-01-02 20:07:38] <@%$turtleTiff> the nutrients in soil replenish after so many years, which is why farmers rotate the kinds of crops they grow, so they dont drain all the nutrients and kill the soil
[2023-01-02 20:07:43] <onemillionexplodingsuns> the idea is to eat a bit of greens and fruits with the meat, keeps the bowls flowing
[2023-01-02 20:07:47] <JimpBackAtIt> Red meat has more bad (ldl) cholesterol, increases risk of heart diseases

[2023-01-02 20:28:22] <+syphon_ac007> her wrecking ball is shit, you should be able to control the balls direction

[2023-01-02 20:28:29] <+silversurfer745> ugly boring map but loot is good and ziplines are nice
[2023-01-02 20:28:33] <teddyate> But anyway, His is talking to less to da Crowd so i would never sup to that
[2023-01-02 20:28:37] <teddyate> GGs tho

[2023-01-02 20:51:37] <+SJ_Destroyer24> cause we have to play preds in our lobbies lol
[2023-01-02 20:51:39] <Mixture89> being in gold, they are just more risky
[2023-01-02 20:51:43] <Mixture89> and sometimes the risks pay off
[2023-01-02 20:51:43] <kabiiTV> Do you think farming 10k lobbies was really worse than just getting in diamond lobbies now?
[2023-01-02 20:51:44] <+smashvilletn> diamond is the new preds
[2023-01-02 20:51:44] <bergsdal> Yea a lot of diamond players are so elitistic
[2023-01-02 20:51:46] <+blehsd> @ekstaaz_fr bro no one uses line line is D1+ lobbies what do you mean lol
[2023-01-02 20:51:47] <%$thank_ufor_subscribing> I think that's cause they don't have a pro 3 stack in the lobby
[2023-01-02 20:51:53] <%+girthy_dragon> im having an easier time in diamond lobbies than plat lobbies

[2023-01-02 20:52:01] <Mixture89> most of the time i get the one that just dive first into a drop with 10 other squads lmfao
[2023-01-02 20:52:02] <+markaimfire_> I assume lower ranked players aren't partied... or not playing with professionals
[2023-01-02 20:52:02] <+scarpenski> yeah we gotta be setup to kill yall
[2023-01-02 20:52:03] <+Vneptu> @cacacaio The map has wayy too open places to fight

[2023-01-02 20:52:04] <+Arrin0> alot of people think theyve hit their cap so they have to hold onto rp intstead of try to gain it
[2023-01-02 20:52:07] <hrnyjlwrdn> the only legend who has completely fallen out of favor and been 100% replaced is gibby imo
[2023-01-02 20:52:09] <%+eruptingboner> that's how they got to diamond in the first place
[2023-01-02 20:52:21] <+scarpenski> if im caught in the open vs u i die
[2023-01-02 20:52:23] <alienxbadass1> So what you’re saying is the lower ranks just need to not care as much about ranking up to rank up
[2023-01-02 20:52:25] <+Kevosrockin> and cant play as much so  tries to not lose rp

[2023-01-02 20:53:29] <+crazye95> bro
[2023-01-02 20:53:29] <%+PawBandito> hot take, pro players play the game thousands of hours more than the average player and their opinion is based off that.
[2023-01-02 20:53:32] <+SJ_Destroyer24> its probably mainly becasue if you wipe a team at the start, you get no reward, so people rat for placement to actually get points
[2023-01-02 20:53:34] <%+VanViolence> im sure lobbies are just filled with people solo queing and not playing as a team. or you got paired with a team thats in a chat and not communicating with you.
[2023-01-02 20:53:37] <ekstaaz_fr> XDDDDD GGS

[2023-01-02 20:56:27] <JAIVIAICA_> I don't understand how you make this game look so easy
[2023-01-02 20:56:27] <beergson> think everyone can agree that ranked rn is braindead

[2023-01-02 21:09:29] <+khornettv> @izfrostzi nah, i think a cap is fine otherwise, how high would you set the bar? Also 50k RP? Or would you lower it to 15k RP, having more Preds than Masters at the end?
[2023-01-02 21:09:36] <+MeatJuice_> preds should just wait like 30 min queues like overwatch LUL

[2023-01-02 21:11:57] <+khornettv> @izfrostzi I think the general cap is fine, but 750 is just weird, 1000 would be more suitable
[2023-01-02 21:12:10] <Sh0heiOhtani> if u add more preds its just low skill players with a pred title. that does nothing to fix it

[2023-01-02 21:21:28] <%razorex001> they just need to make the "report for cheating" option to start working
[2023-01-02 21:21:31] <+ursadlol> Why not put them in their own cheater lobbies

[2023-01-02 21:30:19] <+khornettv> for example, the Hamster of the son of my best friend died, because he was in the closet went to get out, a sweater fell off and crushed him in the closet door <- that's how hamsters die

HimWattson puts the game in another level, and we will be blessed if we ever see a player with his skill and passion for the game again. TSM_ImperialHal breaks records. HimWattson breaks rules. You can keep your statistics. I prefer the magic.
