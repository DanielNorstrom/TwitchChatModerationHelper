[2022-12-20 12:18:57] <@%Casedy> try using the sim in your phone first maybe. It might need to be "activated" first. Then put it in the router
[2022-12-20 12:19:10] <%miketwng> @itzgio2120 you should eat if you're hungry

[2022-12-20 12:27:11] <ilovekoreangirlsss> hi
[2022-12-20 12:27:29] <%+drealselix> the router should have an app that lets you control the device and check settings etc...
[2022-12-20 12:27:53] <@%Casedy> yeah the page earlier she showed was her router page
[2022-12-20 12:28:11] VIEWERS: 585
[2022-12-20 12:28:28] <%+drealselix> i've not used my device in 3yrs so i can't remember how. the configuration should be automatic.
[2022-12-20 12:28:37] <%+drealselix> once you put in the sim, it's done. works..
[2022-12-20 12:28:48] <%桀克 (climax_rj)> @Casedy what is this about?
[2022-12-20 12:29:04] <%+drealselix> the SSID and pw are the same as before. you just connect via wifi
[2022-12-20 12:29:06] <@%Casedy> @桀克 she is trying to get the new sim she bought to work on her huawei router
[2022-12-20 12:29:21] <%桀克 (climax_rj)> which service provider sim card are you using?
[2022-12-20 12:29:32] <@%Casedy> the sim is working on her phone just not the router
[2022-12-20 12:29:36] <%+drealselix> @桀克 is the sim working? is it a data sim too?
[2022-12-20 12:29:54] <%+drealselix> unless they gave her a vox only sim.

[2022-12-20 12:30:48] <%+drealselix> best way to test it is to use the sim on the phone first. if you can't get data on the phone, then it's either not activated yet, or it's a vox only sim
[2022-12-20 12:30:49] <%桀克 (climax_rj)> is it that you can connect but no internet?
[2022-12-20 12:31:12] <%+drealselix> if data works on the phone, then it's router issue...
[2022-12-20 12:31:18] <@%Casedy> yeah she can connect but no internet i think
[2022-12-20 12:31:46] <%+drealselix> @Casedy connecting from phone to router is via Wifi connection, not data
[2022-12-20 12:31:48] <%桀克 (climax_rj)> what sim card brand you using?
[2022-12-20 12:32:03] <@%Casedy> @Casedy i know
