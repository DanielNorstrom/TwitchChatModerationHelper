[2022-12-30 15:59:19] <@%achesst> Good morning Spikelings! I am WTOC's most consistent e-boy, the streamer that made 2022 worth living Aspiringspike and welcome to my final scheduled Shark Typhoon of the year. This time of year we like to visit old friends, so let's check in on our dear friend Soulherder. We can catch up and maybe grab a few trophies! Regardless I get to spend more time with you, the viewers, and maybe that was the real trophy all along. Thank you for supporting the stream praise Klothys and happy 2023 to y'all!
[2022-12-30 15:59:23] <timadough1> I like hot coco

[2022-12-30 16:46:40] <%jace_meister> i think youre better off bouncing the titan
[2022-12-30 16:46:54] <+DragonlordLotus> you just bounce the titan once they haste right?
[2022-12-30 16:46:55] <@%+esqpoe> right, or just bounce titan?

[2022-12-30 16:58:18] <dantethorn> oh is it not standard to run the 5th amulet in the board
[2022-12-30 16:58:23] <EDHpanda> They may have sided out an Amulet, yeah
[2022-12-30 16:58:23] <%MrSeriMTG> this game is painful
