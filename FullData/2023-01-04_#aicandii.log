[2023-01-04 13:11:39] <siprus92> you want to route the pedestrians sperately, so you don't clog your high traffic roads.

[2023-01-04 14:05:20] <siprus92> @AiCandii Intersection design has much bigger impact on the congestion than lane count. More lanes usually just add more space for the congestion to pile up.

[2023-01-04 14:53:02] <le_cavan> make a zone/district around certain roads and ban large trucks?
[2023-01-04 14:53:02] <scud_storm_bg> with roadsigns you can do that i think

[2023-01-04 15:02:26] <+GreyBourbon> I think there is a way to remove them
[2023-01-04 15:02:45] <%Harmonyx_vt> It's really tough to build a grid with the way the city organically expands. Chicago is unique in a lot of ways, because they were able to completely re-design it after the Great Chicago Fire.
[2023-01-04 15:02:49] <%Spinel97> @greybourbon That would make sense. A lot of houses in the first few states have windows that are sealed up with bricks and concrete because they were built before the American Revolution and they're like that because of the window tax in the time period
[2023-01-04 15:03:05] <zahard04> but what if the ai is so true to being human that it makes mistakes?

[2023-01-04 15:05:33] <%LazySamurai> grid patterns only work if you have a circulation plan. Because they have so many crossings compared to organic cities, you need to avoid them stopping at traffic lights and make things one direction with several huge arteries if you ask me

[2023-01-04 15:08:36] <%Spinel97> And evidently Benjamin Franklin wrote a poem about farts. I swear he would've fit perfectly in the 20th century. He was ahead of his time in some ways
