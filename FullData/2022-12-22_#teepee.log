[2022-12-22 15:10:35] <%coffeecup777> yes was about to say apex too
[2022-12-22 15:10:36] <%agent00doobie> Apex def hard
[2022-12-22 15:10:38] <@%ThatOneCel> Apex very hard I agree
[2022-12-22 15:10:38] <%bobweaver85> hmmmmm interesting
[2022-12-22 15:10:39] <%Ryku912> PUBG was a tough learning curve for me
[2022-12-22 15:10:41] <%Sylears> good morning teepee, good morning chat
[2022-12-22 15:10:42] <%Be_Hype> oooh, apex mechanics are so different from most shooters too
[2022-12-22 15:10:44] <%$Zkdk0> Teep got 4 caps in the last game of the Ghost world tournament 😳.
[2022-12-22 15:10:47] <%+xXBAGGERZXx> Do you guys still have a nuke attempt this morning?
[2022-12-22 15:10:48] <%+sgovio> @sgovio lol yup its to easy to kill
[2022-12-22 15:10:48] <%jakesotired> old school ghost recon on pc
[2022-12-22 15:10:49] <%+ateague420> @ateague420 how?? there's no slow down or auto tracking
[2022-12-22 15:10:51] <+tbss_mac> I built a pc recently and I also feel that mouse and keyboard is just as good as controller
[2022-12-22 15:10:51] <%bobweaver85> seems difficult that's why i haven't played lol
[2022-12-22 15:10:51] <@%BladeRunnerKing> @OpTicJadson heres my prediction: they land arcitys but they dont land pred, too many road blocks for pred., maybe they get him next season but not this one imo
[2022-12-22 15:10:53] <+aYOoReckIt> Apex’s Ttk can be tough lol
[2022-12-22 15:10:54] <%jtfray> Counterstrike for sure. Half the kids here haven’t played counterstrike HA!
[2022-12-22 15:10:55] <%$nahledge_> never played tarkov?"??
[2022-12-22 15:11:02] <%coffeecup777> also to master the movement is a biiiig skill gap
[2022-12-22 15:11:02] <@%kyote7667> I played 7 games of apex, shot my gun a bit and didn’t kill anyone. Kek
[2022-12-22 15:11:05] <%nodiggity333> time crisis?
[2022-12-22 15:11:09] <@%ThatOneCel> Going from Cod to Apex is a shock
[2022-12-22 15:11:12] <%huffy_us> Apex is definitely super hard movement and mechanically
[2022-12-22 15:11:21] <%+blenky8> @TeePee maybe not super tough for you, it blew my mind
[2022-12-22 15:11:30] <%jtfray> Fair.
[2022-12-22 15:11:30] <%jorgeelite246> I think csgo over apex

[2022-12-22 15:12:20] <%$J_BOOTY> you at your folks place?
[2022-12-22 15:12:22] <@%BladeRunnerKing> @OpTicJadson nah illey is still gone they pick up someone else as SMG scump goes to flex
[2022-12-22 15:12:23] <@%kyote7667> I don’t get the special things characters do in Val. Don’t get it at all. Tossing balls (wut) and walls and shit. I don’t get it at all.

[2022-12-22 17:27:01] <@%^Streamlabs> Teep has not switched his input, he plays both KBM and controller. Typically he switches when it gets stale. His movement feels better on controller, but his shot feels better on mouse. He’s roughly a 70% - 30% split favoring controller. To tell what he is using, look under his spare plates, if "Y" (controller) if 4 (KBM). teepMnk

[2022-12-22 20:44:08] <@%BladeRunnerKing> @Hyperbeam__ so theres kinda of a cheat way to do it, you can set up picnics now where you can make sandwiches for your pokemon and bathe them, so the exploit is... go to a mass out break and setup a picnic until you get a shiny, the picnic resets the mass outbreak lineup... keep doing so until shiny appears, can take minutes to hours depending on luck, but its 100% effective
