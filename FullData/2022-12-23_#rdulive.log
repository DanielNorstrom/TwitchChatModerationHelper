[2022-12-23 12:18:15] <LuvRong> Just had a weird bug from Battlegrounds. Killed the last guy, but did not pop up the win for me, continue to play, win again, should have killed him, but did not pop up win again, continue to play again, lost, but he did not kill me as I have enough health, then continue to play, win the guy, killed the guy, then the win pops up, so meaning to say the game literally did not want me to win. Sadge.

[2022-12-23 14:46:15] <xwoopswoops> @RduLIVE how strong would a hero power that says " You can see 1 roll in the future " and when you hover over the roll button it shows you the next roll with 2 ???s on 2 of the minions but shows their tavern star

[2022-12-23 14:48:00] <GHA_FTW_> Omg
[2022-12-23 14:48:07] <rikkimaruuu> so basically nozdormu? one free roll?
[2022-12-23 14:48:09] VIEWERS: 3 120
[2022-12-23 14:48:20] <xwoopswoops> yeah it would probably just replace nozdormu's hero power
[2022-12-23 14:48:23] <GHA_FTW_> That should be in the game
[2022-12-23 14:48:26] <%+LmkChris> what about discover a refreshed shop and you can pick between 3 (once per turn obviously)
[2022-12-23 14:48:35] <Rohaerlynn> it would only be broken if you can change whatever the next roll is somehow

[2022-12-23 14:50:27] <@%initiate_bg> we already have that hero it is called Nozdormu ... @RduLIVE

[2022-12-23 14:50:33] <dalitzking> worse noz then no ?
[2022-12-23 14:50:50] <Kamsonii> @RduLIVE how about a HP which rolls but before roll appears, you discover a minion.Whichever you pick is guaranteed to appear on the roll you just did. The rest of the roll is random

[2022-12-23 14:51:10] <@%prasanna29911> @initiate_bg Nozdormu rolls the current shop away. The new hero power allows us to make much better synergy picks

[2022-12-23 15:14:00] <Ckamyo> @RduLIVE I don t know if I am wrong or not but I think it was better to take kalegos because you already have 3 dragons (with kale) and it would be more simple for quest too with battlecry. Now with Theo you need to find minions to buff and no tribe minions. I am not sure either but this is my opinion

[2022-12-23 16:34:40] <%+Teardrith> It's a scaling amount of each sub based on how popular the streamer is. I believe the lowest amount streamers make is like $2 per sub, highest $3.

[2022-12-23 17:09:51] <0RE0N> if you think age doesn't matter watch Kripp trying to play apm pirates BBoomer
[2022-12-23 17:09:52] <@%R2DU> HmmmG Kripp is only 7k mmr but he is far ahead of Rdu in critical thinking and analyzing the playing field, Kripp is always 5 steps ahead and is allready considering what minions to buy in tavern tier 6 while only at turn 2. wheras Rdu is only looking at the battlefield in front of him. i firmly believe Rdu should leave his bg carreer and focus on his cooking.

[2022-12-23 17:10:04] <Baduumtsss> At 2.5k subs it would have been a huge mistake to go to uni and have a corporate job imo
[2022-12-23 17:10:04] <+G04Tzilla> mostly younger people do better at games because they grew up with it, as opposed to older people when gaming wasnt as popular when they were young
[2022-12-23 17:10:05] <7_ate_nein> it's physically easier to acquire new skills until 23-25

[2022-12-23 17:11:33] <%phillykallday> It's important to outwork the people around you but also not compare yourself to other people too much
[2022-12-23 17:11:33] <Baduumtsss> I am just happy that some people manage to escape the corporate matrix, good job :)
[2022-12-23 17:11:37] <+TheSickInfluenza> i think at that time most HS streamers where low on subs
[2022-12-23 17:11:37] <%+deeperlearner> are you in the top 1% of earners in Romania @RduLIVE
[2022-12-23 17:11:38] <Henchman47> Did many of the subs from the subathon renew their sub?
[2022-12-23 17:11:45] <hibyeman> im only here because of occasional sunglasses turn. Sunglasses added probably 1500 subs Kappa
[2022-12-23 17:11:46] <+chouchienne> Do you consider yourself a pro gamer or an entertainer?
[2022-12-23 17:11:47] <%+GibboLUFC94> I started following you because of battlegrounds. For constructed I was always a thijs main and now I prefer battlegrounds!
[2022-12-23 17:11:50] <93DegreesTilt> that also helps a lot. getting foreign currency earnings in a low exchange place
[2022-12-23 17:11:50] <@%+Weirdgus> @RduLIVE I think twitch changing the way subs work kinda helped with that, like when HS had big viewer numbers, gifted subs were not a thing
[2022-12-23 17:11:57] <%+rzielol> Andrew Tate's fault
[2022-12-23 17:11:58] <Chilll3x> You are a clever guy , which is why I like your streams ! Keep up the good work !
[2022-12-23 17:12:03] <DopusDei> how much do u get for one sub as the streamer? like $2 or so right
[2022-12-23 17:12:05] <Elenir88> It's everywhere, every country is getting expensive
[2022-12-23 17:12:05] <M8_Greyhound> how bad is the inflation? it is horrible everywhere, here in Czechia it is like 20%
[2022-12-23 17:12:08] <%FlydudeX> it's not , prices as pretty much the same as the rest of EU
[2022-12-23 17:12:13] <michaeljrichmond> @rdulive if you could move to a different country would you?
[2022-12-23 17:12:15] <Timihash> Its fuckin expensive
[2022-12-23 17:12:15] <GHA_FTW_> @rdulive I think high armour heros are a lot more powerful this patch because the rarer/powerful quests have been made more common
[2022-12-23 17:12:21] <%+cosmin_xyz> you can live alone in romania with around 400 minimum
