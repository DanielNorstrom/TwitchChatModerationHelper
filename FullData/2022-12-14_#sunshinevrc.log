[2022-12-14 11:58:59] <%reivehnfliyt> like, not super sweet, just subtly sweet

[2022-12-14 14:15:17] <+darkpie> @reivehnfliyt I agree, but like I've worked at places where they chose gaming chairs instead of good office chairs for new labs KEKW

[2022-12-14 14:18:32] <%reivehnfliyt> my $270 headset has Bluetooth for up to 20 hours charge and 3.5mm jack compatibility when used on PC with the option for an integrated mic which i took off, Its comfortable and has no RGB, i got a $40 "gaming" headset that had RGB which i didn't care about as a stand-in until i could get this new headset, I will probably give away the "gaming" one to someone in need of a headset who's desperate.
[2022-12-14 14:18:41] <%reivehnfliyt> I still feel i got ripped off
