[2022-12-20 00:32:15] <@%^Streamlabs> TeeP enjoys the core gameplay of WZ 2.0. Loves the look and feel of the map. TeeP prefers free loadout to be during 1st circle and more money economy on the map. Hitching/Lagging is an issue as well. TeeP loves the game so far and looks forward to quality of life improvements. TeeP does not know what the exact meta will be for the game, but the meta will probably evolve quickly as it did for WZ 1. TeeP will be using a variety of loadouts. - !guns for more info

[2022-12-20 00:53:25] <@%^Streamlabs> TeeP enjoys the core gameplay of WZ 2.0. Loves the look and feel of the map. TeeP prefers free loadout to be during 1st circle and more money economy on the map. Hitching/Lagging is an issue as well. TeeP loves the game so far and looks forward to quality of life improvements. TeeP does not know what the exact meta will be for the game, but the meta will probably evolve quickly as it did for WZ 1. TeeP will be using a variety of loadouts. - !guns for more info

[2022-12-20 01:55:48] <@%^Streamlabs> TeeP enjoys the core gameplay of WZ 2.0. Loves the look and feel of the map. TeeP prefers free loadout to be during 1st circle and more money economy on the map. Hitching/Lagging is an issue as well. TeeP loves the game so far and looks forward to quality of life improvements. TeeP does not know what the exact meta will be for the game, but the meta will probably evolve quickly as it did for WZ 1. TeeP will be using a variety of loadouts. - !guns for more info

[2022-12-20 16:45:08] <+beastmodeford> Dark patterns are deceptive online techniques used to nudge users into doing things they didn't intend to do.  For instance, players could be charged for a purchase by pressing one button in an attempt to wake the game up from sleep mode, the FTC said. Players could also be charged for a purchase while the game was in a loading screen or by pressing a nearby button when simply trying to preview an item, the FTC said.

[2022-12-20 16:47:06] <%+chupacabruhh> certain actions in the game that were unrelated to making a purchase would make a purchase.
[2022-12-20 16:47:08] <m3troz00min> It was something about the micro transactions taking advantage of young kids buying in game without parental consent

[2022-12-20 16:47:26] <!%slakayaky> it seems it was more that they deliberately designed the user experience so that they could profit off of misclicks by removing confirmation screens and placing purchase buttons by other buttons
[2022-12-20 16:47:27] <%+TechnoSide2> There’s a part of the lawsuit about chat being  enabled by default . And kids getting exposed to bad content

[2022-12-20 16:47:31] <crixpack> not having a confirmation for the purchase is the issue, 1 mistaken click and the purchase was put through

[2022-12-20 17:12:54] <%+thamuel> they should have a moving stronghold...big old van that you have to chase down and disable

[2022-12-20 17:13:04] <+IceCreanTruck> They make them that expensive to have people talk about. Controversy causes interaction among the community. Aka people talk about the game
[2022-12-20 17:13:11] <%four8four> Does everyone do the stronghold just for the loadout or do you guys do everything else for it as well?

[2022-12-20 17:17:44] <%GreekoIV> i mean.. the game's high on octane, so that only means that the game's at its best when it is full on action, which happens on the later circles

[2022-12-20 17:20:08] <jmthegr8t> exactly
[2022-12-20 17:20:09] <%+dragon5layer956> OR BUYS

[2022-12-20 17:20:13] <%MrAnderson417> I don't know why you're complaining... My games last 5-10 minutes
[2022-12-20 17:20:14] <%+Oceanz21> @tmiller88tm that's what they're saying is a band aid though... just make the br quicker and more fun and you don't need resurgence
[2022-12-20 17:20:14] <$hammy_man_> The pacing of this game is WAY too slow. Teep is right. 100%. It is boring.

[2022-12-20 17:20:21] <@%ChiefsNChop> @kush06 improving it drastically. Good news for everyone
[2022-12-20 17:20:23] <+lionseppuku> Those are the ppl that quotas soon as they die

[2022-12-20 17:20:24] <disastro88> Crazy why u talking about me Teep
[2022-12-20 17:20:24] <%GreekoIV> feels like the game's more strategic or gives another way to play and outplay the rest of the players in the lobby who are better skill-wise
[2022-12-20 17:20:26] <%sirmeowington03> @teepee you fucking nailed it.
[2022-12-20 17:20:26] <+squidsquaddddd> Does Sym got some indigestion going on or something? Man keeps moaning when hes talking
[2022-12-20 17:20:26] <@%kush06> Thats not Ravens fault, thats IW's fault. And its still unfinished @Pil__Seung
[2022-12-20 17:20:27] <swerrvoooo> Rebirth with this movement? LMFAOO it’s chalked
[2022-12-20 17:20:28] <greyarea4528> i liked rebirth in BO4 lol that shit been fire alcatrazz

[2022-12-20 17:20:34] <%ryne_not_ryan> Regaining is awful on this map, no money and the buys are so spreadout
[2022-12-20 17:20:35] <%+shnooginizer47> AYE LOADOUTS ARE BACK
[2022-12-20 17:20:36] <%+HypeOH8> circle collapse should speed up based on lobby count, you've been saying it for years haha
[2022-12-20 17:20:37] <%+speckto3> Also, not having time to grind random guns for meta attachments
[2022-12-20 17:20:38] <dannyx27> this map is to big for br. Well suited for dmz.
[2022-12-20 17:20:39] <%+wilsonl433> your totally right. it's hard to play alot and when I barley ever get a load out
[2022-12-20 17:20:39] <%+PapaBear806> I suck at it but I still have fun trying to get better!
[2022-12-20 17:20:40] <aintgotnojob> snappy snappy

[2022-12-20 17:20:43] <%+dragon5layer956> Im a super casual cause of the demands of work and school. ITs so tough regaining due to no buys, no money, and campers
[2022-12-20 17:20:44] <%+sfrench_92> THis doesnt scratch the BR itch for me like Apex still does or even the original MW1
[2022-12-20 17:20:46] <+1SLOLT1> Everyone wants to play a BR but remove everything that makes a BR good
[2022-12-20 17:20:47] <@%kush06> I didnt think they would do all this before the holidays tbh @ChiefsNChop
[2022-12-20 17:20:47] <%+shnooginizer47> LOADOUTS BACK LFG

[2022-12-20 17:20:53] <fiazhaiy1998> can you buy loadout from buys
[2022-12-20 17:20:53] <$daddydiaziii> We should just talk about the good things in this game because there are very few. Much smaller list to talk about
[2022-12-20 17:20:53] <%+Dunny_03> the footstep audio drives me crazy
[2022-12-20 17:20:53] <Andrewkbmx> That’s even more reason to make the changes they’re making right now.
[2022-12-20 17:20:54] <%+sfrench_92> WZ*
[2022-12-20 17:20:56] <%+benkenohbi> on the other hand, how does a casual expect to get a little better by quitting the game?
[2022-12-20 17:20:58] <%ev_1978> Bambi was holding it down yesterday though
[2022-12-20 17:20:58] <@%goinhamxo> @chiefsnchop drastically is a stretch
[2022-12-20 17:20:58] <coltoniK> I think it more of playing solo and not having anyone to play with

[2022-12-20 17:32:51] <$daddydiaziii> Why dont they just stick to their guns. They had a good idea with making loadouts hard to get so it was an advantage if you got one. But they listen to bots more which I guess makes sense but it plays so bad

[2022-12-20 17:38:17] <%GreekoIV> to be fair.. it was a good change making loadouts available at 2nd circle or 2.5k, though the loadout's value has dropped, therefore lesser people are camping it
[2022-12-20 17:38:18] <%+un4seenpr0blems> Plus the campers can't build a gun.... better they camp with their broken build then the semi-decent ground loot
[2022-12-20 17:38:19] <kweenbdot> Yeah people definitely gonna camp regardless. But I actually like how the loadouts disappear so you can’t camp them so easy.

There might be a small range where if you are capable of hitting all your shots that the Tac V might have better ttk but it has more recoil than the RPK so....

[2022-12-20 17:51:31] <%therealflynnshady> @CjOfiicial When I was a kid I used to take both the Flovent and albuterol inhalers on top of nebulizers my asthma was so bad. I mostly grew out of it but if it is super super cold/windy I'll need it from time to time. As long as I don't need a nebulizer again I'm solid haha

[2022-12-20 18:09:19] <%therealflynnshady> The real question I have on the loadouts you can buy though, is if thrown, are they only available to your squad or if you get wiped before getting it can other teams nab a loadout from it?
[2022-12-20 18:09:23] <+SaleOnBeavers> they legit have white boxes around the map already

[2022-12-20 18:18:56] <Symme_Trees> @TheGrinder66 reason being is because when u got a 2kd or higher u face ppl u dont wanna actually play against because u gotta sweat ur ass off when u just wnana play its a problem for both sides
[2022-12-20 18:19:07] <$daddydiaziii> @daddydiaziii Well for one, there isnt as many of them so the queue time would be just absolutely dumb. If you want them to add a ranked playlist then I get it but everyone is allowed to have their own unpopular opinion. I would guess 90% of people dont want SBMM in a casual game
[2022-12-20 18:19:07] <%+thewerd23> So who gets the kill? The one who knocks or the one who fulls? Sorry for the dumb question. I don't play wz2 and just watch teep haha

[2022-12-20 19:56:03] <nate121> @bauzzer_ Starting early just puts a target on you for no reason, Can't place the nuke until 4th circle regardless.
