[2022-12-22 15:59:50] <TomWithTime> technically the ai is "training" and not "referencing". It learns what lines come together to make specific features and perspectives rather than stitching references together

[2022-12-22 16:00:34] <$MindTheTiberium> An AI doesn't reference it has no interpretation it just smooshes all its dataset together in the way you ask it too

[2022-12-22 16:07:26] <%+terry_garstasio> just use 2FA
[2022-12-22 16:07:27] <%$bu1dak> Yea it's the additional encryption and 2FA
[2022-12-22 16:07:28] <%+vinny2582> @JonBams Yes but then you pair it with another form of security. We wanted layers not just a One big wall right?
[2022-12-22 16:07:29] <%d3bruts1d> There are some password managers that are local. However most of the "top" ones are cloud based, which I agree sounds stupid AF.

[2022-12-22 16:08:25] <nvrmissashot> @Jonbams because you make a very strong password and add something like 2fa which makes it super safe. then you can have completely random characters for the rest of your passwords. And they can't leak your password because they don't have it, they save a "Hash" of your vault than can only be unincripted by 1 password
