[2023-01-04 15:50:29] <%+OneDaySlater> DD doesn't convert damage to True Damage.  It stores damage that you would have taken and you take it again later.  You take it as True Damage so that it's not mitigated by resists a second time.

[2023-01-04 16:19:24] <monkeyboy90411> so, the older pantheon tricked A Sol into a false peace and fake friendliness, and the people of Targon offered him a crown as a sign of friendship/worship. A Sol with his fascination of the creatures of Runeterra and his Ego graciously took the crown and then he was enslaved by the people of Targon to do their bidding because the crown had enslaving magics
[2023-01-04 16:19:24] <%+Koz_n_Effect> is flashing to auto with it?
[2023-01-04 16:19:25] <jup3e> Did i hear wrong or is Spear shot going to korea?
