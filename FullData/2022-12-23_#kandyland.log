[2022-12-23 00:48:50] <Scuffler> As a 4--face beauty wise(6 by women whom like me, so I deduct 2)--I've tried face masks and such, and found them all to be a sham. Sorry to say, improves things for a few days. If you want lasting change, you gotta improve your nutrition/health, the annoying stuff that takes work. -From: A man who has yet to become a 5.
