[2023-01-09 14:59:39] <+Nfs_legend> missed hawk = accessories worthless
[2023-01-09 14:59:39] <indefinite_rogue> He seems more like hes gonna be a support class in akan KEKW
[2023-01-09 14:59:58] <catalinnr> so cluncky
[2023-01-09 15:00:13] <jinxedluck> The raw damage is still higher than previous but lower than double class
[2023-01-09 15:00:16] <harune___________________> why did they say SS is a range class when it stays mostly in melee range?
[2023-01-09 15:00:17] <brlly> needs to much effort for not even a mediocore dps
[2023-01-09 15:00:17] <jinxedluck> but seems clunky

[2023-01-09 15:01:17] <+Nfs_legend> yeah rogue spec = high cd, swift = no mana MaxLOL
[2023-01-09 15:01:18] <yoromichi> majority of the classes need QoL adjustments more than some number buffs

[2023-01-09 20:00:43] <+TwoPillows> @Jawarts the other option is more points into a damage skill, technically if you hit your skills life absorption is dps loss.
[2023-01-09 20:00:58] VIEWERS: 959
[2023-01-09 20:01:16] <+TwoPillows> sharpshooter main damage going into last shot and focused shot taking less time may make it more viable to not take it
[2023-01-09 20:01:17] <+Jawarts> yes, but the utility of move speed is worth too

[2023-01-09 20:48:53] <+gugygugy> No they move some portion of extra damage tripods of rifle skill to give some damage when boss is over 50%
[2023-01-09 20:48:59] <Xtra_Step> @AmenoShiryuu tl,dr they buffed perfect shot and focused shot. Long story, the tripods with dmg under 50%  hp now have dmg + bonus under 50%, so more consistent, and focused shot is 3 shots with that tripod, so faster

[2023-01-09 20:50:44] <Kluzien> bullet rain and catastrophe have low cooldowns and they don't affect movement too much so I like them
[2023-01-09 20:50:50] <+domprophet> 11mil dps is pretty bad compared to other classes right arent thy at like 15-20 mil dps?
[2023-01-09 20:51:04] <+Jawarts> you get more or less the same dmg but you cancel some times rain of bullet, with practice the other should be better
[2023-01-09 20:51:08] <%+weirdflavour> @domprophet but keep in mind that th eboss isnt under 50%
[2023-01-09 20:51:10] <+KenobiSU> Thats what I like about GS as main, quite a few options based on preferences, with little difference in dps

[2023-01-09 21:10:19] <+The_Finchi> Is salvation better than nightmare?

[2023-01-09 21:32:40] <!%LustKR> dont think you run out of tripod iirc

[2023-01-09 21:34:49] <milkywaywu> which is free
[2023-01-09 21:34:53] <+ppbfx> gotcha
[2023-01-09 21:35:15] <!%LustKR> oh yeah i guess we came from using cata
[2023-01-09 21:35:21] <!%LustKR> thats where it came from
[2023-01-09 21:35:24] <$shawncu> catastrophe is better imo since it saves a tripod and animation is shorter for the 3 bubble
[2023-01-09 21:35:35] <Darstezi> i've been using cata with eternal calamity tho

[2023-01-09 21:36:43] <$shawncu> Eternal calamity is not good since the boss tends to move a lot and you lose half of the dmg.
[2023-01-09 21:36:45] <!%LustKR> seems like dropping SRF angle to me
[2023-01-09 21:36:51] <+Kroynix> @panaam_gg but no tripod
[2023-01-09 21:36:53] <!%LustKR> if you want maximum damage

[2023-01-09 21:37:05] <+Jawarts> focus shot tripod change, for speed rotation
[2023-01-09 21:37:07] <+iitshabibi> @LustKR and run BR and CATA
[2023-01-09 21:37:19] <!%LustKR> BR still does more than SRF
[2023-01-09 21:37:22] <Darstezi> ps does more than cata in ptr tho
[2023-01-09 21:37:22] <!%LustKR> even in PM3
[2023-01-09 21:37:22] <Hoonhaha> Does  Gunslinger only have counter on shotgun “Last request”?

[2023-01-09 21:37:39] <!%LustKR> DPS wise
[2023-01-09 21:37:46] <$shawncu> After last buff to the PM3 short gun, SRF is too strong to drop compared to bullet rain.
[2023-01-09 21:37:47] <Kluzien> BR has low cooldown and you can walk around
[2023-01-09 21:38:02] <gabyul88> @hoonhaha nah there's 1 more in handgun stance
[2023-01-09 21:38:07] <+Extros_> SRF sucks anyways
[2023-01-09 21:38:09] <+Jawarts> you forgot to change focus shot tripod, for speed rotation
[2023-01-09 21:38:13] <saiboteh> SRF is so shit
[2023-01-09 21:38:14] <%alexgoham> how is BR dmg with in a tight spot 1?
[2023-01-09 21:38:25] <Chadouwx> SRF makes you use spacebar on another skill instead of the highest one (Focused shot) makes the gameplay clunky imo

[2023-01-09 21:38:52] <%alexgoham> ah yeah thats not worth
[2023-01-09 21:39:20] <+The_Finchi> Both BR and Cata feels better to use in actual raid scenarios that SRF

[2023-01-09 21:39:38] <Hoonhaha> @gabyul88 can you point out which one is?
[2023-01-09 21:39:52] <Chadouwx> Srf its so slow man
[2023-01-09 21:40:15] <+Jawarts> maybe if you dont have SRF you dont have the weird "no skills" time
[2023-01-09 21:40:23] <%+deadlypants112> if the other skill got updated would be so much better the one where u shoot very fast 1 shot
[2023-01-09 21:40:30] <Darstezi> but isn't the "no skills" time kinda a good thing
[2023-01-09 21:40:39] <+tirrorex> why you guys test trixion with lvl 10 gems?
[2023-01-09 21:40:43] <saiboteh> BR looks way cooler imo
[2023-01-09 21:41:01] <%+deadlypants112> the first shotgun skill
[2023-01-09 21:41:07] <+Jawarts> true
[2023-01-09 21:41:10] <%+deadlypants112> if that got updated would be nice
[2023-01-09 21:41:14] <+stillbild> I think the best comparison would be at least a 3min parse right? just testing one rotation will bias towards SRF

[2023-01-09 21:46:55] <+heirelentiya> @Meusovoz Is slightly more damage, but you have to manage Mana Addiction and have slower attack speed. For most its not worth.
