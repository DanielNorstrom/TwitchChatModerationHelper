[2022-12-14 01:16:12] <%TheRealSteveMD> probably the same engine as dusk i'd bet
[2022-12-14 01:16:17] <%trtrtrtrees> pretty sure all his games are made in Unity
[2022-12-14 01:16:21] <%sketchyjuli> This is definitely not shovelware
[2022-12-14 01:16:26] <%trtrtrtrees> the early builds of DUSK were in Unity

[2022-12-14 23:40:00] <Digitalbrother> I used to think that there were too many Gundam shows out there, and that I could never get into it. Now I have seen 90% of the franchise and it was mostly a good experience.
[2022-12-14 23:40:14] <@%achievementguy> this is a very complicated map
