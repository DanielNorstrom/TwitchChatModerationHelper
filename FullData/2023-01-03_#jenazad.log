[2023-01-03 05:07:18] <!%PotatoesHUH> like that was very unprofessional
[2023-01-03 05:07:22] <lgruxyl> im pretty sure the game will get more famous after the streams
[2023-01-03 05:07:23] <lehocat> She had audio for the counterside sponsor

[2023-01-03 05:07:29] <Wave_Jaeger> E7 Marketing Manager prob crying the entire time lol
[2023-01-03 05:07:30] <%Beanflakes> it really shouldve been ina who did it instead
[2023-01-03 05:07:33] <!epicnue> I needed to look into how worth it it is to get hololive to sponsor stream but sounds like that might actual do more dmg for the game than good
[2023-01-03 05:07:35] <%Beanflakes> but ina is on vacay
[2023-01-03 05:07:40] <%NagaSiar> why so bad like that.
[2023-01-03 05:07:45] <%Tantfant> felt kinda unprofessional, i thought hololive was kinda pro
[2023-01-03 05:07:48] <%+Bab3l99> so do they still get paid lol?
[2023-01-03 05:07:49] <Norwiener> wait there's a client for counterside? NOWAY
[2023-01-03 05:07:53] <!%Cooowop> RIPBOZO
[2023-01-03 05:07:56] <RamlethalSimp> I guess we're never getting a official collab after that debacle
[2023-01-03 05:07:59] <sStarMech> it sucks they only had 1 hour to do E7 content
[2023-01-03 05:07:59] <inferno2918> the way kronni talked about the game was sarcastic AF
[2023-01-03 05:08:10] <shinzen_sho> well I dont really watch vtubers that much but man that was utterly dissapointing
[2023-01-03 05:08:14] <RageTageKat> IDK what we're talking about but if jena is disappointed im disappointed SeemsGood
[2023-01-03 05:08:17] <%ie_g> i think the best way to describe it is she handled it unprofessionally as a sponsored streamer
[2023-01-03 05:08:25] <!%PotatoesHUH> yea thats a bad reason to hate on her, thats just how she talks
[2023-01-03 05:08:26] <VoltageSlash> the covers good tho car6Sip
[2023-01-03 05:08:27] <%+Astvon> they got the wrong people imo
[2023-01-03 05:08:29] <Holystea> then why pay 3Head
[2023-01-03 05:08:30] <%+bde___> they should get gura or someone Pog
[2023-01-03 05:08:32] <RageTageKat> new stream layout @Jenazad ? POGCRAZY
[2023-01-03 05:08:33] <%meatyoakair> sennykParasocial omg my favorite vtuber plays e7 too
[2023-01-03 05:08:34] <!%PotatoesHUH> kronii and kiara were just not the right choices is all
[2023-01-03 05:08:37] <+DesolaterGater> Should have gotten Pekora to do it, the way she plays FGO is fun
[2023-01-03 05:08:37] <%Servene> only if it was pekora and marine
[2023-01-03 05:08:39] <%slicejr> AYAYA

[2023-01-03 05:10:24] <!%PotatoesHUH> i think the whole collab was just full of bad choices; wrong song choice, wrong people to sing it, wrong people to sell the game, etc @Jenazad
[2023-01-03 05:10:25] <!%Cooowop> yaaaaa
[2023-01-03 05:10:34] <%Servene> sponsor nijisanji instead Baseg

[2023-01-03 05:10:44] <leifplease333> in kronii stream I feel like she was making fun of the game more than advertising

[2023-01-03 05:11:20] <%Beanflakes> i watch hololive on pornhub ok
[2023-01-03 05:11:23] <Wave_Jaeger> They need to sponser XQC and get all the juicers to play xD
[2023-01-03 05:11:25] <!%Cooowop> HUH
[2023-01-03 05:11:26] <!epicnue> it's tough sometimes with big sponsors because I ideally like to sit in with the talent for 30 minutes or so before the date of spnsorship so they have some product knowledge or can answer their questions. big talents dont like that tho light7Adisgust

[2023-01-03 05:11:48] <!%Cooowop> i believe that 200%
[2023-01-03 05:11:49] <MyBrokenTayo> Felt like all the advertising budget went to Aespa & they went to hololive w/ what they had left
[2023-01-03 05:11:54] <!%Cooowop> WOT
[2023-01-03 05:11:54] <lgruxyl> youtube ads would be better i think

[2023-01-03 05:12:12] <!%PotatoesHUH> OH I GET MY PC TMRW YAAY
[2023-01-03 05:12:13] <yokazo> i think the big problem with hololive en
[2023-01-03 05:12:16] <yokazo> is that they arent gamers
[2023-01-03 05:12:27] <inferno2918> on the bright side i think nijisanjiEN might be getting an E7 sponsor this week @Jenazad
[2023-01-03 05:12:31] <yokazo> whenever they do any sponsorship they never enjoy playing the games
[2023-01-03 05:12:33] <%meatyoakair> @PotatoesHUH YAAY
[2023-01-03 05:12:38] <!epicnue> maybe just wrong gen. tbh I wasnt the biggest fan of myth compared to overse- ah. my thoughts exactly

[2023-01-03 05:12:47] <^Nightbot> Specter Tenebria is at the top of every list I see and she completely deserves it. The dark tyrant that requests us lower level humans to kiss her feet. Little did she know I am excited to get the honor to even get close to her spectacular feet. Would I not only kiss her feet but I would personally clean each of her toes by sucking on each one until she is satisfied with the result. I can imagine the smell of roses from her feet as I lick in between her toenails.
[2023-01-03 05:12:52] <!%PotatoesHUH> one of each wouldbe been fine

[2023-01-03 05:15:22] <%Xamess> !currentsong
[2023-01-03 05:15:23] <^Nightbot> @Xamess -> "86 EIGHTY-SIX - Ending Full『Avid』by SawanoHiroyuki[nZk]:mizuki" by AniMelody – Anime Music is the current song. It was requested by Danzras - https://youtu.be/u0CqY27IFyo
[2023-01-03 05:15:23] <%ie_g> my problem with the hololive cover song is they did such a bad english translation that the singer felt like they're trying to catch up to the beat so they're singing as much lines as possible that it sounds so weird xD
[2023-01-03 05:15:26] <%barald> is your stene on kaladra for this?

[2023-01-03 05:48:17] <Mashido1> KEKW
[2023-01-03 05:48:20] <!%Cooowop> off
[2023-01-03 05:48:22] <%jeybeezee> but how do you get enough of the conversion mats without crafting right side
[2023-01-03 05:48:23] <%+kevingg141> craft what makes you happy HappyGachaPlayer
[2023-01-03 05:48:24] <%meowmutu_> right side OMEGALUL
[2023-01-03 05:48:26] <!%Cooowop> oof lacDank
[2023-01-03 05:48:28] <%+lanfort1> 100 gears. speed couldnt pass 11 BibleThump
[2023-01-03 05:48:30] <shinkirito69> Because im gold poor
[2023-01-03 05:48:37] <RageTageKat> SUBprise
[2023-01-03 05:48:41] <@%+imCharmanderrr> if u look at any legend player's well built unit, like 95% of them will have triple conversion right side lol
[2023-01-03 05:48:41] <%Beanflakes> you extract the drops from hunt ok
[2023-01-03 05:48:42] <shinkirito69> so i can just trash bad right side gear
[2023-01-03 05:48:47] <%+screaming_noises> If man was anything like me, ran out of conversion gems for right side
[2023-01-03 05:48:47] <SozNerfed> thats the right mentality ok
[2023-01-03 05:48:47] <+0numberz> If i am broke should I sell rather then extract as a newer player?
[2023-01-03 05:48:48] <$LockeCollier> @imcharmanderrr thanks, but to use blue Boxes I need to extract right side gear, right? How do I excract If I never craft It?
[2023-01-03 05:48:56] <+jayse79> oh didnt know that
[2023-01-03 05:49:07] <Sai__s> @jeybeezee craft right side when you need coversion mats
[2023-01-03 05:49:10] <@%+imCharmanderrr> @LockeCollier extract from hunt or if you need conversion mats for the blue boxes, its ok to craft it for the sake of extracting

[2023-01-03 10:33:03] <%thedefault888> Left is way better, crit dmg isn’t that useful for injury alencia, she’s gonna be doing enough dmg for max injury most of the time anyway. Her key thing is to never die
