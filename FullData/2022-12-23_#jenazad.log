[2022-12-23 06:07:41] <loysius22> !yulha
[2022-12-23 06:07:42] <^Nightbot> Yulha is currently popular because 1: She has a 100% provoke on her S1 (krau does not) 2: her S2 lets her full cleanse + gives herself a barrier AND cr push, which essentially guarantees she gets her S3 off at low hp (krau is worthless vs debuffs) 3: her S3 ignores all damage share (including arrowell's escort) + heals her if it kills. She is a solid answer to currently popular units like Lhc, adin, riolet, etc due to how easy it is for her to kill them with her S3

[2022-12-23 06:49:32] <^Nightbot> Specter Tenebria is at the top of every list I see and she completely deserves it. The dark tyrant that requests us lower level humans to kiss her feet. Little did she know I am excited to get the honor to even get close to her spectacular feet. Would I not only kiss her feet but I would personally clean each of her toes by sucking on each one until she is satisfied with the result. I can imagine the smell of roses from her feet as I lick in between her toenails.

[2022-12-23 07:05:31] <sStarMech> i think it lags because of the new replay thing @Jenazad

[2022-12-23 07:47:05] <EluciadeLuteIma> they will still complain that they will not get it
[2022-12-23 07:47:06] <Aam_Shagar> Problem is that if they add rewards to RTA, they should give the players the possibility to have at least 6 full build units easily for pvp
[2022-12-23 07:47:06] <%mrpickle932> I can’t beat abyss 12 delete all of abyss please

[2022-12-23 07:49:23] <Professor_Cedar> I do get kinda bummed that certain skills just don't work in PvE. Like why can't ML Vivian get damage reduction in PvE. Still takes focus. :(

[2022-12-23 08:12:21] <+Sputnik042> I think the bug was for those who had already cleared 5 after reset, I had to go back in and beat 5 again to unlock it earlier.
[2022-12-23 08:12:26] <Droiver> i got to 5 and i didnt clear 4, maybe that was the bug
[2022-12-23 08:12:28] <badsector32> @Jenazad click go on 5

Those of us relying on her imprint, or essentially any part of her kit are now left with a dead character. Where is the announcement for a recall? I don't even mean a selector, though that really feels warranted here if Challenger Dominiel's cosmetic text change warranted one, but just the magic button that lets us recover mola, imprints, etc. from a bricked character.

[2022-12-23 08:34:18] <+VahnSeru> Thing is, E7 is mainly a PvP focused game that's why I think they don't care as much about the PvE player's opinion on balance unless we get something like Jade Scorpion

[2022-12-23 08:36:02] <+FirstNameBasis_> they need to rework her and her artifact she she doesn't NEEd that dumb rng to do damage.
[2022-12-23 08:36:04] <Taknarosh> she does less dmg than arunka...
[2022-12-23 08:36:06] <+VahnSeru> If the KPOP fans can't get Karina buffed then nobody can
[2022-12-23 08:36:07] <Dubbleoseven> @mysteiic i dont think its that easy to increase your dmg 50% with the snap of a finger might just be my lower quality gear but yeah that doesnt make my opinion invalid
[2022-12-23 08:36:12] <backspace999> @jenazad Genshin indirectly buffs bad units by introducing new mechanics in the game, like how Dendro did to so many older units, e7 needs to do that

[2022-12-23 08:44:42] <Dubbleoseven> @mysteiic i think we ll just have to disagree i mean remove straze from the equasion for a sec try putting yourself in a newer players shoes if you didnt have yufine the safest comp would take you 4 to 5 mins on a13 and you could end up in an unending loop with it. but i dont think it matters much to most ppl so ill just let it rest

[2022-12-23 08:46:13] <steardream> Ever since melena buff I have dropped to challenger V. I hate how the game is punishing counter units and banshee players. Considering we make up most of the player base the game isnt gonna last very long if this doesnt change asap! How does sg expect me to farm wyvern from scratch just to counter one unit (even though she cant be countered) truely a bad decision and I will be taking my money elsewhere!!!

[2022-12-23 09:23:29] <%AcdcEsidisi> @PotatoesHUH Ever since melena buff I have dropped to challenger V. I hate how the game is punishing counter units and banshee players. Considering we make up most of the player base the game isnt gonna last very long if this doesnt change asap! How does sg expect me to farm wyvern from scratch just to counter one unit (even though she cant be countered) truely a bad decision and I will be taking my money elsewhere!!!

[2022-12-23 09:47:29] <Tesslaract> Well, if anyone is reading this while watching do yourself a favor: Don't listen to what this guy has to say, he's the type of player that only slaps speed sets on his characters and thinks he knows how to play bruiser, He talked on and on about NICHE ways to use the niche unit that Yufine has become but couldn't think on one single way to use Karina lmao
[2022-12-23 09:47:32] <+VahnSeru> Have people been trying out counter Karina?

[2022-12-23 12:48:11] <+Priestess_Yera> depends on what you want
[2022-12-23 12:48:14] <Beanflakes> depends on if you want a build that uses the wt swords ez
[2022-12-23 12:48:16] <DingyRag> some areas unlock based on full white or full dark sometimes
[2022-12-23 12:48:19] <%ZessZZ> i would say elden ring is very improved upon model of this though lol
[2022-12-23 12:48:40] <Beanflakes> there are builds that purely just focus on using a full white or black wt sword
[2022-12-23 12:48:41] <%+r_jorjo> U need both WT but unless using a guide ….
