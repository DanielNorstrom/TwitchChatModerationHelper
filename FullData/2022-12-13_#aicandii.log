[2022-12-13 11:52:41] <Vex_Ahlia_CR> the game has an lot of min/max backseaters so playing streaming is oft rooSuffer
[2022-12-13 11:52:41] <tdo1g> they will automatically move the rocks from the speace you want to put something on
[2022-12-13 11:52:44] <%+Bird_toe> You have to select the rocks and choose the haul option
[2022-12-13 11:52:46] <Justicar_Trueblood> you need a dumping stockpile for the rocks
[2022-12-13 11:53:00] <readreadchopper> make a storage area that only allows rocks

[2022-12-13 12:09:23] <%+Papa_Zuzu> you can build a room and out a bed in it, and set the bed to 'prisoners'
[2022-12-13 12:09:25] <@%CptTinko> You need to build a dedicated separate room to have prisoners there
[2022-12-13 12:09:25] <%TheSmartestOfStupids> To make a jail, you need a room with a bed ,set as prison bed and the whole room becomes a prison

[2022-12-13 12:16:35] <%FlagshipKongou> you need to build a room and put a stockpile in it or being outside damages and eventually destroys things like clothes and food.
[2022-12-13 12:16:42] <+SilverNightwing> @aicandii When you open the work tab tasks on the right are lower priority than tasks on the left. Meaning hauling is only done if there's nothing else to do. You only have one pawn set to haul at present but they're doing other things

[2022-12-13 13:32:33] <+Ruthbane> have you ever seen a cow farm? those have SO much space
[2022-12-13 13:32:46] <%Grissbe> they didnt touch food because hauling is low on prio list, also food stockpile prio is low too so they will do it only when there is nothing else to do
[2022-12-13 13:32:51] <%GrayOfSloth> also dont put a torch in the fridge because that heats up the room

[2022-12-13 14:46:00] <%InsignificantAnomaly> QoL tip, you can hold shift to stack multiple orders for a colonist to perform

[2022-12-13 15:20:26] <%TheSmartestOfStupids> yes that's a very good trick : create a sleeping spot righ on top of the injured person, then set the bed to medical, you cut off all the travel time back to the base, if they die in 2 hours it can save them

[2022-12-13 15:48:42] <+Mijolnir__> roof is free
[2022-12-13 15:49:11] <Gungnier> btw growing dandelions for animal grazing is much better than hay. Hay only good if you actually let it grow and harvest.
[2022-12-13 15:49:20] <%Xziotic> ^
[2022-12-13 15:49:24] <$Clemdawgg> you can roof up to two tiles away from any wall
[2022-12-13 15:49:25] <%BETD23> buy wall get roof free, very good deal
[2022-12-13 15:49:42] <%legioned247> At the most basic, steel is made by mixing carbon and iron at very high temperatures (above 2600°F). Primary steelmaking creates steel from a product called “pig iron.” Pig iron is smelted iron, from ore, which contains more carbon than is correct for steel.
[2022-12-13 15:49:50] <%Xziotic> Do check the 'Sun Lamp' description first btw.
[2022-12-13 15:50:01] <%legioned247> ok candii
[2022-12-13 15:50:12] <%legioned247> pig iron

[2022-12-13 15:50:37] <%legioned247> I like the word pig iron
[2022-12-13 15:50:43] <%VoxPhox> you already have a lamp in storage
[2022-12-13 15:50:48] <+Mijolnir__> @Xziotic pwer req like 2600w

[2022-12-13 15:50:59] <@%CptTinko> 🐷
[2022-12-13 15:51:00] <%Liontuna> yeah
[2022-12-13 15:51:16] <%demonfox7> also you need to have cable running to all of these items that run on power
[2022-12-13 15:51:22] <%Liontuna> they eat from the ground  as long as the food is in the pen
[2022-12-13 15:51:24] <$Clemdawgg> normally the muffalo will graze on their own
[2022-12-13 15:51:43] <+pizzakat86> well im home from work due to food poisoning, how goes the warcrimes simulator
[2022-12-13 15:51:48] <%Liontuna> yeah they eating the Hay of the ground as it grows
[2022-12-13 15:51:52] <%legioned247> there so much management
[2022-12-13 15:52:02] <@%CptTinko> Blood will disappear sooner or later anyway
[2022-12-13 15:52:10] <+Mijolnir__> when you build the wind turbine you can build wiring and see blue lines that represent power connection
[2022-12-13 15:52:12] <$Clemdawgg> oh there is no animal inbreeding

[2022-12-13 15:52:43] <Dienwald> you cannot
[2022-12-13 15:52:52] <%Liontuna> ok so prioritize the building the windmill - then under the power tab you have the wires
[2022-12-13 15:52:57] <%GrayOfSloth> you dont have the tech to make components yet
[2022-12-13 15:53:00] <%Xziotic> Wiring? When laying wire, a wiring interface will show up, just make sure they are connected. Electrical appliances can connect to wiring a few cells away.
[2022-12-13 15:53:13] <Dienwald> you can find components as Compacted Component nodes that you can mine
[2022-12-13 15:53:20] <@%CptTinko> Go raid other settlements ironmouseRAID
[2022-12-13 15:53:23] <%BranMatts> If you start over, this can be one of those times we can look back on and laugh and laugh and laugh...
[2022-12-13 15:53:32] <%Liontuna> he might be missing parts
[2022-12-13 15:53:37] <+Mijolnir__> you can mine compenetns from the top right rock formation the orange stones
[2022-12-13 15:53:47] <%Xziotic> You can get components from deconstructing ship debris
[2022-12-13 15:53:53] <%Liontuna> up a bit
[2022-12-13 15:53:54] <%Grissbe> deconstruct walls near your base, those are made from steel
[2022-12-13 15:54:00] <Dienwald> Click the stones
[2022-12-13 15:54:01] <@%CptTinko> RIGHT
[2022-12-13 15:54:01] <%VoxPhox> you can buy components from traders once the map runs out
[2022-12-13 15:54:11] <Dienwald> it's called Compacted Components
[2022-12-13 15:54:12] <uselesstrashpanda> The dark brown stone is normal components

[2022-12-13 17:05:23] <ryder_booli> Candii just build the lines to touch the outside of the battery
[2022-12-13 17:05:29] <%jcsol0421> good enough

[2022-12-13 17:07:19] <%jcsol0421> research it first
[2022-12-13 17:07:34] <+SilverNightwing> Ah yeah need to research
[2022-12-13 17:07:34] <ryder_booli> you may need two but yes thats the right idea
[2022-12-13 17:07:40] <%Grissbe> its easier if room is smaller
[2022-12-13 17:07:42] <%TheSmartestOfStupids> you can also build an air conditionner, it will make one side cold and one side hot
