[2022-12-15 22:12:17] <@%Toonfish> @Cyeena if you want easy croutons just buy some regular sliced white bread, cut it into somewhat evenly sided cubes, put them into a big bowl, toss with canola oil and salt and bake at 180° for however long to get them as brown as you want them (don't make them too dark, they get a little darker after you take them out of the oven, too)

[2022-12-15 22:12:47] <@%Toonfish> you'll really wanna do them in the oven to dry them out, if you make them in a pan the center stays moist-ish and un-crunchifies the outside

[2022-12-15 23:05:49] <amv1> japanese is kinda fucked since the language itself is pretty close to normal (european for me) languages, with alphabet and stuff, but they had to borrow writing from chinese
[2022-12-15 23:06:07] <%Ratched10> @amv1 yea PepeHands
[2022-12-15 23:06:12] <%NIER33> @Bloodhit Correction needed naroGlare
[2022-12-15 23:06:25] <amv1> thats why you have at least 2 different sounds for most kanji and thats why they used some kanji in a simplified form for alphabet
[2022-12-15 23:06:27] <%meshiura> what i read is that kanji is chinese characters before they simplified them
[2022-12-15 23:06:36] <%Bloodhit> I learned from this site it's pretty easy OkuuNODDERS https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/learn-hiragana/

[2022-12-15 23:06:58] <amv1> i guess writing 2 dots or circle was much easier than finding another kanji for another letter

[2022-12-15 23:07:14] <%meshiura> but imo it's best to learn the alphabet as you learn the basic vocab

[2022-12-15 23:11:53] <amv1> i've "learned" kana in 1-2 weeks too, i also used Obenkyo on my phone in spare time to grind them. but that wasn't really learning, i've only properly memorized them when i started reading actual japanese
[2022-12-15 23:12:18] <amv1> in the sense that i could read kana very quickly without remembering some letters
[2022-12-15 23:13:03] <%Ratched10> are there manga's with basic hiragana? cirPomp
[2022-12-15 23:13:16] <amv1> hiragana is really easy, i still have problems with katakana sometimes

[2022-12-15 23:20:46] <%meshiura> @amv1 i assume reading it wasn't enough, what did you do to practice?
[2022-12-15 23:21:00] <amv1> https://guidetojapanese.org/learn/ Tae Kim is also really good as a simple general guide
[2022-12-15 23:21:18] <amv1> there are apps with it for android too
[2022-12-15 23:21:49] <amv1> @meshiura i've only played games, mainly visual novels with text hooker as i do like reading
[2022-12-15 23:21:59] <amv1> then slowly transitioned to console games
[2022-12-15 23:23:04] <amv1> both VN and many console games have voiceovers so i've learned spelling in the process, can watch slice-of-life anime without subtitles too
[2022-12-15 23:23:04] <%Ratched10> first time quiz 100% with dakuten but that might be cause its only 1 dakuten set + i just learned them CirnoShrug
[2022-12-15 23:23:22] <%meshiura> getting the basics to actually start reading something simple feels like the hardest part
[2022-12-15 23:23:33] <amv1> my japanese is still far from perfect but i can play games with dictionaly on my phone, that was the goal
[2022-12-15 23:23:44] <%Ratched10> words -> knowing meaning, seems like the hardest part... cirPomp
[2022-12-15 23:24:11] <amv1> yeah, my first visual novel was like hitting a brick wall at 100km/h
[2022-12-15 23:24:24] <amv1> i've struggled on every 2nd sentence
[2022-12-15 23:24:50] <%meshiura> at that point you kind of need to know at least the pleb-tier kanji
[2022-12-15 23:25:03] <amv1> i've probably started way too early but eh, textbooks were boring
[2022-12-15 23:25:08] <%Ratched10> how did you manage to actually understand what the hiragana meant? like that seems so hard for me cirPain

[2022-12-15 23:27:57] <amv1> let me find an example...1 minute...
[2022-12-15 23:29:27] <amv1> https://alexbft.github.io/chiitrans/img/screen4.png its a program, there are several of them, that captures text from game and displays it in separate window while attaching a dictionary to it
[2022-12-15 23:30:00] <amv1> so it separates the text into words and you can hover mouse over each word to instantly get its meaning
[2022-12-15 23:30:06] <amv1> or over kanji
[2022-12-15 23:30:29] <amv1> that gets rid of your "what does this hiragana means" problem
[2022-12-15 23:30:38] <%Ratched10> cirPain i feel like i just dipped my toe in a bottemless pit cirPain
[2022-12-15 23:31:41] <amv1> https://i.imgur.com/95H85p4.jpeg
[2022-12-15 23:31:42] <%meshiura> and if you're ever finished with japanese, there are other languages NepSnide
[2022-12-15 23:31:49] <%Ratched10> @meshiura HEH NO!
[2022-12-15 23:32:28] <amv1> color-coding each word, displays kanji readings on top of them and as i said just hover a mouse over anything to get its meaning from dictionary
[2022-12-15 23:33:48] <amv1> it can also use several translation sites like google translate or stuff with AI learning to translate text too if you want
[2022-12-15 23:34:13] <amv1> https://github.com/Artikash/Textractor i think thats the most popular one atm
[2022-12-15 23:34:26] <%Ratched10> @amv1 i just downloaded that one
[2022-12-15 23:34:50] <amv1> and no, its not a bottomless pit, i think everybody uses them to read visual novels and play games, at least in the beginning
[2022-12-15 23:34:55] <amv1> it REALLY helps
[2022-12-15 23:37:01] <amv1> https://i.imgur.com/0uaUXmA.jpg thats my setup for reading VNs in beb, windows tablet, some VNs and text hooker window overlay on top
[2022-12-15 23:37:43] <amv1> i just had to force myself to stop using it to translate every words by quickly moving cursor over the entire sentence lol
[2022-12-15 23:37:46] <%Houdini111> PepeLaugh I'd be using one of those to understand anything at all.
