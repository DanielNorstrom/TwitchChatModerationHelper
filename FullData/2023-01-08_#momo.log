[2023-01-08 00:25:30] <%FullFenrirMoon> I think he stopped calling him boy after the last game, like a show of respect and acknowledgement that Atreus has grown

[2023-01-08 00:25:48] <%AxillaryPower> I think Kratos starting calling boy Atreus by the end of the last game, so doesn't call him boy anymore.
