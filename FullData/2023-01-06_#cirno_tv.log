[2023-01-06 01:43:37] <@%Toonfish> "Hachez" is what they're called, some of the best 77% chocolate I've had considering the price OkuuNODDERS

[2023-01-06 01:45:27] <~%Cirno_TV> that sounds good cirISee
[2023-01-06 01:46:43] <@%Toonfish> if you wanna experiment a bit and don't mind paying a little more than for your run-of-the-mill chocolate, I can highly recommend looking through some brands here https://www.slavefreechocolate.org/ethical-chocolate-companies
[2023-01-06 01:46:44] <%Phoenixsong> the advent calendar I got from IKEA has hachez chocolate in it RoWOW
[2023-01-06 01:47:01] <@%Toonfish> they are usually more pricey than other chocolates for obvious reasons slainGuns but that also means they don't skimp on quality OkuuNODDERS
[2023-01-06 01:47:07] <@%Toonfish> at least the ones I've tried were quite nice
[2023-01-06 01:47:28] <@%Toonfish> @Phoenixsong RoWOW
[2023-01-06 01:48:04] <@%Toonfish> I was really surprised by them, I usually hate it when chocolate manufacturers put vanilla in their chocolate because it often just exists to mask some unpleasant aromas but theirs works really well OkuuNODDERS

[2023-01-06 02:46:46] <%amv1> lol no
[2023-01-06 02:47:10] <%amv1> so you were talking about chocolate, is Ritter Sport considered a good brand in germany?
[2023-01-06 02:47:22] <@%Toonfish> Ritter Sport is fucking disgusting imo cirPomp
[2023-01-06 02:47:28] <@%Toonfish> some people think it's good
[2023-01-06 02:47:33] <%amv1> and same question about Schogetten
[2023-01-06 02:48:00] <@%Toonfish> not a big fan of schogetten myself but many people like them
[2023-01-06 02:48:12] <%amv1> thats the most popular german chocolate in stores here
[2023-01-06 02:48:14] <@%Toonfish> I would call both of those chocolates for people without and advanced chocolate palette
[2023-01-06 02:48:20] <%amv1> ritter and Schogetten
[2023-01-06 02:48:26] <@%Toonfish> most popular gotta be milka
[2023-01-06 02:48:48] <%amv1> milka is made in poland iirc
[2023-01-06 02:49:06] <@%Toonfish> Milka is like THE "brand" chocolate over here
[2023-01-06 02:49:09] <@%Toonfish> like hershey's is in the US
[2023-01-06 02:49:10] <%amv1> i'm thinking about made in germany chocolate
[2023-01-06 02:49:46] <%Soviet5lo> @robotisbroken say YEP

[2023-01-06 02:49:56] <@%Toonfish> GEPA and Vivani are both made in Germany for example OhIToot
[2023-01-06 02:50:33] <@%Toonfish> Lindt is also quite popular over here but not made in Germany
[2023-01-06 02:50:51] <@%Toonfish> Lindt is like what normal people think "fancy chocolate" is
[2023-01-06 02:51:19] <%amv1> oh yeah, Lindt is nice but kinda expensive
[2023-01-06 02:51:21] <@%Toonfish> but Lindt is actually still super commercial naroSlain
[2023-01-06 02:51:46] <@%Toonfish> Lindt is also quite affordable if you're looking for good chocolate
[2023-01-06 02:52:05] <@%Toonfish> I'd say Lindt is a step up from stuff like Milka and Schogetten but still lacks in a lot of areas
[2023-01-06 02:52:14] <@%Toonfish> they have some banger products though OkuuNODDERS
[2023-01-06 02:53:19] <%amv1> i'm looking for a good and cheap chocolate cirNom
[2023-01-06 02:53:36] <@%Toonfish> what kinda chocolate do you like?
[2023-01-06 02:53:46] <@%Toonfish> milk, 45, 60, 70, 80?
[2023-01-06 02:53:54] <%amv1> Ritter seems fine to me
[2023-01-06 02:53:58] <@%Toonfish> milka also has 45% milk chocolate which is surprisingly nice
[2023-01-06 02:54:15] <%amv1> i usually eat milk but sometimes 60-70% ones
[2023-01-06 02:54:34] <@%Toonfish> my favorite lindt product is this one https://www.amazon.de/dp/B009O8LSS2/
[2023-01-06 02:54:53] <@%Toonfish> I think they use a different chocolate for these compared to their other products and it has some really nice depth
[2023-01-06 02:55:01] <@%Toonfish> well not depth
[2023-01-06 02:55:21] <@%Toonfish> it's more like breadth I gues
[2023-01-06 02:55:21] <%amv1> anyway i was just curious about what ppl in germany think about popular international german brands cirISee
[2023-01-06 02:55:22] <@%Toonfish> guess

[2023-01-06 02:57:04] <@%Toonfish> for reference, this is my favorite chocolate https://www.amazon.de/dp/B000F7KMHE/ 26€ for 100 grams naroSlain
[2023-01-06 02:57:33] <@%Toonfish> (I only get that on special occasions cuz of the price)

[2023-01-06 02:58:41] <@%Toonfish> currently I get most of my chocolate from a local chocolaterie https://www.2fach.eu/ cir3
[2023-01-06 02:59:10] <@%Toonfish> like 6 bucks per 100g which is on the upper end of what I'm willing to pay for for everyday chocolate
[2023-01-06 02:59:34] <@%Toonfish> but they definitely make some of my favorite bars OkuuNODDERS
[2023-01-06 03:03:03] <%ZsnakeX> RobotIsBroken say cirLurk
[2023-01-06 03:05:15] <%amv1> chocolate is more like an everyday snack for me, i don't mind cheap ones. not extremely cheap, palm-fat oil ones though thats why i'm looking for something made from actual chocolate

[2023-01-06 20:41:57] <%Houdini111> Yeah... I have an 8700k which means a minimum of MB and RAM. I'm also getting a new cooler because 1) my current one is likely to not be sufficient and 2) it allows me to have a mostly complete PC to gift to a sibling.

[2023-01-06 20:47:11] <%Houdini111> @Fenix_TV cirPomp Probably not. They don't even have a price announced. Probably going to be royally expensive for not that much difference. I could always do it later. I'm just waiting for the regular 7900 to see if maybe it's not really locked down and is effectively a 7900X with a different default.

[2023-01-06 20:55:59] <%Gelil> I mean if the bracket comes up, you should be able to get it out without damage
[2023-01-06 20:56:22] <~%Cirno_TV> it doesnt fully come up, it attaches in 4 seperate spots and 2 of them are stripped

[2023-01-06 21:04:43] <@%+SilverSonic> Oh snap it's Churro
[2023-01-06 21:04:45] <@%+SilverSonic> cirHi
[2023-01-06 21:04:46] <%Houdini111> @Bloodhit XMP is a built in memory overclock profile. Generally required to allow your RAM to run at its full capability.
[2023-01-06 21:04:50] <~%Cirno_TV> here I just took a picture of it
[2023-01-06 21:05:26] <%Sanglune> I never bother with overclocking
[2023-01-06 21:05:58] <~%Cirno_TV> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/233768605441851402/1061012636755579031/20230106_130420.jpg
[2023-01-06 21:06:02] <%Houdini111> @Sanglune But it's not really overclocking. It's technically not the base spec but it's already been validated to run at that spec.
[2023-01-06 21:06:02] <~%Cirno_TV> its obvious to tell what the fucked ones are
[2023-01-06 21:06:16] <~%Cirno_TV> its impossible to grab onto them with needle nose pliers they'e so damn thin
[2023-01-06 21:06:17] <@%+SilverSonic> 😬
[2023-01-06 21:06:22] <@%+SilverSonic> yeesh
[2023-01-06 21:06:44] <%Houdini111> @Cirno_TV monkaS Ah... Yeah... Probably going to need to cut it or something.
[2023-01-06 21:06:44] <~%Cirno_TV> and that's a really hard backplate to break without leverage underneath it
[2023-01-06 21:06:45] <@%+SilverSonic> is that a noctua backplate?
[2023-01-06 21:06:49] <@%+SilverSonic> monkaS
[2023-01-06 21:06:56] <~%Cirno_TV> its really fucked
[2023-01-06 21:06:56] <~%Cirno_TV> lmao
[2023-01-06 21:07:16] <~%Cirno_TV> trust me i've done plenty of car work where I need to be clever with how to extract a bolt or a screw
[2023-01-06 21:07:21] <~%Cirno_TV> I cant come up with a good solution that doesnt compromise th emotherboard here
[2023-01-06 21:07:26] <%amv1> oh, they're square. yeah, break plastic around them and then grab with pliers
[2023-01-06 21:07:30] <@%+SilverSonic> dude my heartbeat just skyrocketed just looking at that
[2023-01-06 21:07:34] <%Gelil> Needle nose are probably your best bet
[2023-01-06 21:07:48] <@%+SilverSonic> like holy fuck the anxiety of having to fix that
[2023-01-06 21:07:51] <%Gelil> or you can try and just break the corners of the brackets off
[2023-01-06 21:07:52] <~%Cirno_TV> there's a very slim chance I can succesfully break the plastic around that
[2023-01-06 21:07:56] <%Fenix_TV> fenixt6Stare dat backplate
[2023-01-06 21:07:58] <~%Cirno_TV> without hurting something
[2023-01-06 21:08:19] <%hynpo> could you reinforce the spinning bits with something like a JB weld?
[2023-01-06 21:08:37] <~%Cirno_TV> nope
[2023-01-06 21:08:55] <~%Cirno_TV> I actually genuinly dont know how those 2 pegs cut through the plastic like that
[2023-01-06 21:09:00] <~%Cirno_TV> they got tightened as much as the other ones
[2023-01-06 21:09:10] <%amv1> you can also make straight cuts into them with a thin dremel disk and then use flat screwdriver to hold them
[2023-01-06 21:09:12] <%Gelil> Too SwoleFairy
[2023-01-06 21:09:17] <@%+SilverSonic> if I had to guess, a lot of torque
[2023-01-06 21:09:48] <%Gelil> The others are loose correct?
[2023-01-06 21:09:49] <@%Duo11> On that topic, I think I'm gonna order a new prebuilt PC this weekend nepSmug
[2023-01-06 21:09:50] <~%Cirno_TV> the dremel trick miiiiight work
[2023-01-06 21:10:01] <~%Cirno_TV> but they're very thin so even with that I might not have enough bite with a flat head
[2023-01-06 21:10:31] <%Gelil> You might be able to use something platic as a lever to for the plastic off the metal sqaure
[2023-01-06 21:10:36] <%Fenix_TV> duo11 cirISee fenixt6Tail
[2023-01-06 21:10:39] <@%+SilverSonic> what prebuilt duo
[2023-01-06 21:10:39] <~%Cirno_TV> to get the cooler off I actually had to sneak a really short 10mm wrench under the cooler so I could unscrew the bolts on the cooler
[2023-01-06 21:10:44] <~%Cirno_TV> but the nuts that screw into those pegs
[2023-01-06 21:10:45] <%Houdini111> cirPomp You may also try filing away at it since it'll be easier to not touch the MB, or stop when you do, with that.
[2023-01-06 21:10:47] <~%Cirno_TV> are just fucked
[2023-01-06 21:11:12] <@%Duo11> fenix cirISee tyrissTail
[2023-01-06 21:11:25] <~%Cirno_TV> I must have aboslutely over tightened them
[2023-01-06 21:11:28] <%Gelil> If you have cut through the plastic that much, might be able to lever it off
[2023-01-06 21:11:34] <@%Duo11> @SilverSonic idk yet. Got any suggestions? OhISee
[2023-01-06 21:11:39] <~%Cirno_TV> I can guarantee the amount of grip strength i'd ned to overpower a screwdriver would be more than I have
[2023-01-06 21:11:53] <~%Cirno_TV> I was almost overpowering the wrench
[2023-01-06 21:11:56] <@%+SilverSonic> I don't really have any suggestions, given I'm still looking at options myself and am feeling unsure
[2023-01-06 21:12:14] <@%+SilverSonic> because I need a prebuit with at least one or two extra PCI slots free for a capture card and possibly another
[2023-01-06 21:12:20] <@%+SilverSonic> at minimum 2 PCI slots
[2023-01-06 21:12:38] <~%Cirno_TV> I wish I could find an actual picture of the base of those pegs
[2023-01-06 21:12:50] <~%Cirno_TV> they're thinner than a penny at any rate
[2023-01-06 21:12:55] <~%Cirno_TV> so you wouldnt get much bite with a flathead
[2023-01-06 21:12:58] <~%Cirno_TV> it'd just skip
[2023-01-06 21:13:06] <%Fenix_TV> Probably dumb...but would a heat gun soften the plastic enough to let you get pliers around the metal? I have no idea what to suggest
[2023-01-06 21:13:19] <%Fenix_TV> Without damaging the mobo obviously

[2023-01-06 21:14:38] <%amv1> i would try dremel to destroy either plastic or peg itself, just be very careful and use small cutting disks

[2023-01-06 21:14:58] <%fcloud> cirBoogie
[2023-01-06 21:16:26] <~%Cirno_TV> I do indeed have a dremel and a small cutting wheel
[2023-01-06 21:17:02] <~%Cirno_TV> I mean one of my other options was spend 150 bucks on a new mobo so if I do slip with it then welp
[2023-01-06 21:17:10] <~%Cirno_TV> that plan still stands
[2023-01-06 21:17:17] <%Gelil> I know myself enough to know that a dremel near the back of my mobo is a bad idea.
[2023-01-06 21:17:26] <~%Cirno_TV> yeah
[2023-01-06 21:17:31] <~%Cirno_TV> i'm really not comfortable with it
[2023-01-06 21:17:51] <~%Cirno_TV> if i'm going that last ditch with it I might aswell just get a mobo
[2023-01-06 21:17:53] <@%Duo11> I suppose buy a new mobo and break the old one on purpose is an option nepSmug
[2023-01-06 21:18:10] <%amv1> cover the mb surface with some tape, there will be lots of metal dust and it can protect it a bit if you slip with dremel

[2023-01-06 22:01:28] <%Houdini111> @Cirno_TV cirPomp Fair enough. As long as you never want to upgrade the CPU until you get a new MB then whatever.

[2023-01-06 22:02:02] <~%Cirno_TV> yeah exactly i'll do that if Iw anna upgrade cpu in a year or 2
[2023-01-06 22:02:06] <%Houdini111> NOTED MB already had its shipping label created.

[2023-01-06 22:02:30] <~%Cirno_TV> which I got a few weeks ago
[2023-01-06 22:03:19] <~%Cirno_TV> i'm basically at the top now outside of the 5950x so a new chip would be a new chipset
[2023-01-06 22:03:30] <%Houdini111> d3mindNODDERS 5900X should be plenty fine for a good while.
[2023-01-06 22:03:36] <~%Cirno_TV> so if I fucke dup with the power tool i'd just be wasting money on a sidegrade
[2023-01-06 22:03:43] <%Houdini111> And yeah. No real upgrade path anyways. cirYep
[2023-01-06 22:03:46] <~%Cirno_TV> not worth
[2023-01-06 22:03:53] <@%+SilverSonic> undervolting would be your best option
[2023-01-06 22:04:03] <~%Cirno_TV> yeah i've been looking at peopel undervolting this

[2023-01-06 22:04:56] <%Houdini111> @SilverSonic Well that's intentional. They'll just run at 95C regardless. Though maybe the non X will be different.
[2023-01-06 22:05:10] <%trolcatz> cirno is getting 7950X3D cirThink ?
[2023-01-06 22:05:17] <~%Cirno_TV> haha nah
[2023-01-06 22:05:23] <~%Cirno_TV> i'm skipping this gen of cpu's
[2023-01-06 22:05:23] <%Houdini111> skadiWhaled
[2023-01-06 22:05:34] <~%Cirno_TV> also boards for those cost 600 dollars right now
[2023-01-06 22:05:36] <@%+SilverSonic> yeah I'm aware Houdini111, given they choose to run it at thermal limits before power limits cirSlain
[2023-01-06 22:05:37] <~%Cirno_TV> at least at my local shop
[2023-01-06 22:05:45] <%trolcatz> cirISee
[2023-01-06 22:06:00] <@%+SilverSonic> but the temps drop from like 95c wtih Eco Off to 61c with Eco mode on at 105W TDP
[2023-01-06 22:06:03] <@%+SilverSonic> which is insane
[2023-01-06 22:06:12] <@%+SilverSonic> and that's on a high end AIO
[2023-01-06 22:06:14] <%Houdini111> I bought my CPU almost 4.5 years ago. Not a bad lifetime. And even then, I'm planning on gifting it so it'll still be used.
[2023-01-06 22:06:14] <~%Cirno_TV> https://www.memoryexpress.com/Search/Products?Search=x670
[2023-01-06 22:06:21] <@%+SilverSonic> I'm still on a 4790k
[2023-01-06 22:06:27] <@%+SilverSonic> I'm 100% due for an upgrade
[2023-01-06 22:06:28] <@%+SilverSonic> but
[2023-01-06 22:06:47] <@%+SilverSonic> I kinda want to keep getting life out of my PC before I figure things out
[2023-01-06 22:07:00] <@%+SilverSonic> also I want a 4060, whenever that seemingly exists
[2023-01-06 22:07:23] <%Houdini111> If it's still working for you then great. But I'm also already pushing the limits of my CPU and am already planning on doing more CPU intensive stuff in the coming months. cirLaugh
[2023-01-06 22:07:50] <%trolcatz> with how bad 4070ti is, 4060 will probably be 3060ti cirLaugh
[2023-01-06 22:07:54] <~%Cirno_TV> i'll probably upgrade to whatever amd's next cpu is after the 7xxx
[2023-01-06 22:08:01] <@%+SilverSonic> the reason I say 4060
[2023-01-06 22:08:03] <@%+SilverSonic> is because AV1
[2023-01-06 22:08:09] <%trolcatz> cirISee
[2023-01-06 22:08:10] <@%+SilverSonic> 30 series only has AV1 decoding
[2023-01-06 22:08:14] <@%+SilverSonic> I want encode/decode
[2023-01-06 22:08:27] <%OhIToot> sealW
[2023-01-06 22:08:28] <@%+SilverSonic> because when that encoder format gets implemented into Twitch and Youtube
[2023-01-06 22:08:33] <@%+SilverSonic> shit will be game changing
[2023-01-06 22:09:07] <%Houdini111> CirnoShrug I ain't paying the premium for that yet. By the time it's commonplace enough to be useful the next gen will probably be out.
[2023-01-06 22:09:16] <@%+SilverSonic> ye
[2023-01-06 22:09:18] <%trolcatz> I guess that would be a reason for streamers to upgrade
[2023-01-06 22:09:23] <@%+SilverSonic> hence why I'm just dragging it out
[2023-01-06 22:09:27] <@%+SilverSonic> my 2060 is doing just fine
[2023-01-06 22:09:40] <@%+SilverSonic> but I want an upgrade sometime for streaming purposes, and PC gaming ofc
[2023-01-06 22:09:47] <@%+SilverSonic> though I rarely do the latter these days
[2023-01-06 22:09:56] <%Houdini111> @Cirno_TV Is this one not available near you? https://pcpartpicker.com/product/42hFf7/asrock-x670e-pg-lightning-atx-am5-motherboard-x670e-pg-lightning That's what I went for.

[2023-01-06 22:39:05] <%Houdini111> @Sanglune At 1080p your biggest bottleneck is probably your GPU. cirPomp Upgrading your CPU would require a new MB, and new RAM at the minimum. But the question is, what are you playing that's not running well, or wanting to play.
[2023-01-06 22:39:12] <%Sanglune> Especially since my GPU seems to be making my PC reboot

[2023-01-06 22:43:18] <@SirFireNewt> DDR stands for double data rate so two transfers per clock cycle to add on to what houdini said naroWow

[2023-01-06 22:44:56] <%Houdini111> A quick ebay search shows DDR3 typically being 1600MHz. So there's certainly a chance that XMP just isn't enabled and its' running slower than it could.
[2023-01-06 22:45:16] <@%+SilverSonic> my ram is 1600MHz

[2023-01-06 22:59:00] <%Sanglune> Hm, if I wanna future proof do I just upgrade my GPU or get ready to upgrade everything cirThink
[2023-01-06 23:00:03] <%Houdini111> I mean, your computer already can't reach modern AAA games minimum spec. You'd need a full replacement to "future proof" it. But you could also try getting just a GPU, see if that's enough for you, and then upgrade the rest later if it isn't.
[2023-01-06 23:01:31] <%Sanglune> I'm just completely inexperienced in PC building. cirSlain
[2023-01-06 23:02:07] <%Houdini111> For us to help more we need to know your target. What games are you wanting to play, what settings, what resolution, and what framerate do you want. cirISee
[2023-01-06 23:02:32] <%Sanglune> So if I'm looking for a GPU upgrade, I don't wanna half-ass it but I don't wanna spend a fortune.
[2023-01-06 23:03:00] <%Sanglune> It's also a work PC I guess
[2023-01-06 23:03:28] <%Sanglune> I don't often do video editing but lots of general art programs
[2023-01-06 23:03:29] <%Houdini111> Well another consideration is if your budget is for a whole computer or just a GPU cirPomp

[2023-01-06 23:11:07] <%Sanglune> Then I'm only worried if my mother board and PSU etc. can support it or don't break from modern technologies
[2023-01-06 23:11:43] <%Houdini111> If you're only upgrading your GPU then your MB doesn't really matter. As for your PSU, we'd have to know what one you have.
[2023-01-06 23:11:50] <%Kinq> def get a good psu with gold+ rating
[2023-01-06 23:12:20] <%Houdini111> Efficieny rating is not an indicator of quality, except maybe at the super high end with platinum.

[2023-01-06 23:34:32] <%Houdini111> One major advantage of liquid is that it can soak more heat before it has to cool, which is great for burst loads. It can also have more radiator space which can make it better at the high end. But in the middle it's more of a toss up. Water coolers have a higher minimum noise thanks to their pumps but lower maximum noise thanks to their massive radiator potential.
