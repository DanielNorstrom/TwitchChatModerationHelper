[2022-12-11 14:34:50] <fellowcomrade06> i feel like weapons are only useful to clutch damage
[2022-12-11 14:34:54] <milkcornflakes> weapon is slow, even with Sacri weapon they cost 3 = as 1 atk
[2022-12-11 14:35:03] <Skyonick> weapon seems worth for geo because their base dmg is low
[2022-12-11 14:35:03] <Bhuy1242> Without WGS you lose like 2-3 dmg per strike
