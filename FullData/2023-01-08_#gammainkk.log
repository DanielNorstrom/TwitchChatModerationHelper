[2023-01-08 11:40:36] <@%ThatVtuberAlex> So you will need to turn off all VR. Check base stations are stable. Giving them a wipe wouldnt hurt and would power the base stations off and on. once their one check headset cable is plugged in properly then restart vr and try again

[2023-01-08 13:04:51] <%Sen_Paissa> I think the largest issue with voice acting in FFXIV isn't budget but file size. Voice files take up wayyyy more of a game's size than you would think. If everything was voiced the game would be freaking massive
