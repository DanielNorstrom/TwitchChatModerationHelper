[2022-12-07 17:56:02] <@%^Nightbot> Worth is different to everyone. Some people value loot. Some people value missions. So people want 40 hours of content. Some people would be happy with 2. Measuring "worth" for a specific person is determined by their preferences and what they enjoy, which means there is no universal answer to 'is it worth it'.  For what it's "worth", so far Leopard is enjoying Witch Queen content more than Beyond Light because Savathun > Eramis.
