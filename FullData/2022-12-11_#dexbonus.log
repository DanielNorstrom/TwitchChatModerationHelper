[2022-12-11 14:48:00] <+Ebony71> math is awesome!!
[2022-12-11 14:48:01] <%+gamesofKay> its because teaching math is actually teaching logic, which is a really hard thing to do
[2022-12-11 14:48:03] <@%BaerBones> I loved math as a kid
[2022-12-11 14:48:08] <%midwinterlilly> yea and the way they do math not is NOT the way they did math when I was a kid doogSuffer teaching nephew math was doogBurn during the pandemic when it was my turn to chip in
[2022-12-11 14:48:08] <+KerwinBJones> The only math I learned that was applied later is in application to a video game
[2022-12-11 14:48:14] <%+SirSirveaux> I‚Äôll be able to help with math until geometry because I never understood that as a middle schooler. And then it got better with calculus.
[2022-12-11 14:48:20] <ashy_h> math is so important for understanding statistics and knowing when the media is exaggerating stuff like "chocolate is good for you" and stuff
[2022-12-11 14:48:22] <Inkanobi> I'm just bitter over how little I actually used the Calculus of my courses stripPout
[2022-12-11 14:48:22] <%nemo3538> upper math transitions to a point that are difficult to understand for most people

[2022-12-11 14:48:31] <%$stachystat> That's a shame. There is an issue where you need to know all the previous math so it's easy to fall behind and stay behind.

[2022-12-11 14:48:41] <%JetpackMcQuack> math is *high concept*
[2022-12-11 14:48:44] <%+DornishVintage> @gamesofKay, honestly most is teaching arithmetic. I didn't *learn* math until Uni
[2022-12-11 14:48:44] <+nick21994> I can only speak about the UK< but maths classes are definitely not written in a way to make kids see the relevance to real life
[2022-12-11 14:48:46] <+OhHelloMere> I couldn't work well with "invisible math" like Algebra, but geometry and trig made sense because I could see it.

[2022-12-11 14:49:03] <loatroll> teaching is hard
[2022-12-11 14:49:03] <+AidanFolkes> there does get a point where academic maths is about learning how to do maths research
[2022-12-11 14:49:03] <%JetpackMcQuack> yeah!
[2022-12-11 14:49:09] <roaakie> ohh watson looks so cozy <3
[2022-12-11 14:49:12] <Freaky_Pinky> that sadly happened to me with reading
[2022-12-11 14:49:15] <RMutt1917> @sirsirveaux I loved geometry a d it was only  a semester
[2022-12-11 14:49:18] <%Flint_Whitelock> I always worked best when I could see something with practical application. So I could see it in a real world context easily... but often they strayed from that as it went higher level
[2022-12-11 14:49:22] <%nemo3538> it feels like that‚Äôs most subjects
[2022-12-11 14:49:30] <%+SirSirveaux> @stachystat so you‚Äôre saying you have to watch Algebra in order to understand the plot of algebra 2?
[2022-12-11 14:49:30] <%americanduchess> i loved algebra and trig. the only thing i didn't understand was like sin and cos idk why that just went over my head
[2022-12-11 14:49:30] <%Noiremun> I always loved math but I *despised* the  rules of how it needs to be written. I hated learning them and adhering to them

[2022-12-11 14:49:31] <%$stachystat> Maths does have a persistent problem with recruiting teachers.
[2022-12-11 14:49:34] <%tellyrose_> so accurate. I didn't start to like math again until it was framed as the language of science
[2022-12-11 14:49:34] <%midwinterlilly> My nephew is a math savant, its really cool but also terrefying... doogSuffer
[2022-12-11 14:49:34] <+KerwinBJones> math is most guilty of just beating things to death with repetition
[2022-12-11 14:49:34] <Inkanobi> for a while*
[2022-12-11 14:49:38] <Downfall27> Part of that is the limitation of having to teach 20 kids at once who all learn at different speeds
[2022-12-11 14:49:40] <%+gamesofKay> Then we get letters involved, then greek letters, and in more advanced EE courses we even had to use hebrew letters
[2022-12-11 14:49:44] <+Nyxceris> maths is basically just problem solving and solving problems just feels good in the brain
[2022-12-11 14:49:44] <FlawLizArt> I felt like that, but then I found my love for it again once I started working and actually applying the concepts
[2022-12-11 14:49:46] <%$stachystat> @SirSirveaux LUL yes doogTrash
[2022-12-11 14:49:47] <%Noiremun> To this day I dont know how to write proper geometry notation....and I had Math 5 years in uni LUL

[2022-12-11 14:50:04] <%$stachystat> teaching 20 kids at different speeds is the same issue for all subjects tho
[2022-12-11 14:50:14] <@%BaerBones> I think i was quite lucky, I really liked all of my math teachers, until i got to A-Levels
[2022-12-11 14:50:28] <Inkanobi> It took me years after high school to love reading again stripPout

[2022-12-11 14:51:22] <Muted_Melody> The best times I had learning math were when we applied what we learned in games and stuff to compete.

[2022-12-11 14:57:17] <ethrad> @JRisJunior i've also been betrayed
[2022-12-11 14:57:17] <+Vaelith> Honestly I figured Sam would be liek DODGER GUESS WHAT?!?
[2022-12-11 14:57:18] <%+gamesofKay> are therefore some hades 2 streams coming soon?
[2022-12-11 14:57:21] <Mr_door> what's the last thing?
[2022-12-11 14:57:27] <RMutt1917> I saw it reported on in 5 Minute Gaming News
[2022-12-11 14:57:27] <%+SirSirveaux> @rallipappa not much is known yet. It‚Äôs another child of Hades, mythologicallynspeaking
[2022-12-11 14:57:28] <Drarorm> hey same
[2022-12-11 14:57:32] <%$Ampsand> Even Smallgiant games was blown away with the fan art already.
[2022-12-11 14:57:35] <%midwinterlilly> yes I finally finished HADES and got the final ending day before yesterday
[2022-12-11 14:57:35] <%+JRisJunior> @JRisJunior we're in this together doogLaugh
[2022-12-11 14:57:37] <%W_Tile> but now its not the end, because there is hades 2
[2022-12-11 14:57:39] <%maxvolume> I've only beaten 2 runs, but that felt like enough for me. Was a great game
[2022-12-11 14:57:41] <%nemo3538> it‚Äôs worth finishing
[2022-12-11 14:57:41] <$AgentSmithJr> ahh u do the same thing... avoiding closure FeelsBadMan
[2022-12-11 14:57:47] <%Coulby> i got the epilogue like literally 1 day before the hades 2 announcement doogLaugh took me 95hours to get all achievements and the epilogue
[2022-12-11 14:57:56] <$SparksV> Supergiant have a FAQ about Hades II for anyone who wants a bit more info on it
[2022-12-11 14:57:59] <%puffMaggie> i got to the end credits of Hades, is there more after that?
[2022-12-11 14:58:02] <+AidanFolkes> i still haven't read the last Terry Pratchet book for the same reason
[2022-12-11 14:58:05] <roaakie> LUL LUL
[2022-12-11 14:58:07] <KoriUnloaded> ooo kitteh cuddles
[2022-12-11 14:58:11] <%+Empty_Cognizance> were you into the other supergiant games at all?
[2022-12-11 14:58:19] <KettleBlack> I started everday working from home speed running hades, then most of the day after that
[2022-12-11 14:58:20] <@%BaerBones> I do that with anime too ;-;
[2022-12-11 14:58:24] <$Lennox276> @rallipappa From Supergiant's Website: Hades II is a direct sequel taking place sometime after the events of the original game. No prior knowledge of the original Hades is needed, though there are plenty of connections!
[2022-12-11 14:58:27] <%+Dalewren> avoiding closure stresses me out
[2022-12-11 14:58:31] <%$Ampsand> Oh yeah Watson. Didn‚Äôt see you there.
[2022-12-11 14:58:34] <$AgentSmithJr> <3
[2022-12-11 14:58:36] <%+Dalewren> I like endings

[2022-12-11 14:58:38] <coollike> Trying to decide if I want to get in on the hades 2 early access or wait for the game to be finished
[2022-12-11 14:58:45] <%Brandling> @puffMaggie If you're talking about travelling the river, there's more.
[2022-12-11 14:58:48] <+Joshdread> I still have my copy of Terry Pratchetts "The Shepards Crown" thats unread, still can't bring myself
[2022-12-11 14:58:50] <toffietoppie> i'm still on the final mission of both god of war and witcher
[2022-12-11 14:58:51] <%nemo3538> Imagine trailer
[2022-12-11 14:58:59] <RMutt1917> I get too much satisfaction from finishing things to do that
[2022-12-11 14:59:12] <%puffMaggie> @brandling oh crap i gotta play more then
[2022-12-11 14:59:18] <Mr_door> :I did Hades 1 EA. It was a fun time  and the content that was available made sense.
[2022-12-11 14:59:23] <Dornhall> I'm probably going to wait. I like just sitting down and playing a complete thing
[2022-12-11 14:59:32] <$SparksV> That's party why I'm SO excited about Hades II is that I loved playing Hades I throughout the early access period and now I'll get that experience again
[2022-12-11 14:59:38] <%archangler> Playing through early access was like an episodic story.
[2022-12-11 14:59:44] <%mythberry> hiiiii <3
[2022-12-11 14:59:45] <%Brandling> You also played after 1 year of the start of Early Access, I believe.
[2022-12-11 14:59:46] <%W_Tile> they were smart to gate the plot ont he first versions
[2022-12-11 14:59:50] <+Nyxceris> I got Hades when it launched into EA and played it at each major update, and I really enjoyed it every time and then also played loads more at 1.0
[2022-12-11 14:59:50] BAN: Nyxceris (60s)
[2022-12-11 14:59:53] <bluubeard> Yeah, I think I'm gonna hold off on hades ea, but that hasn't stopped me from the slime rancher 2 ea
[2022-12-11 14:59:57] <%midwinterlilly> I felt that after restarting the game when it was out I didnt finish most of the storylines before completeing the game so being in it earlier and not being able to finish might be the right move PrideUnicorn doogHug
[2022-12-11 15:00:05] <%puffMaggie> the pre pandemic Hades streams were so cozy and now nostalgic to me lol
[2022-12-11 15:00:11] <%JetpackMcQuack> i don't know what they're gonna do
[2022-12-11 15:00:11] <%$Ampsand> Speaking of anime, did you see the Crunchyroll trailer for an anime about a guy who pops into an RPG world and his power is basically ordering any foodstuff and equipment from Amazon and making friends with monsters through food?
[2022-12-11 15:00:17] <@%ArnarBjornss> yeah some games I've tried to not dive into right away (I can tell I'll love the game, or at least upon trying it for a bit). Like early access stuff.
[2022-12-11 15:00:22] <Geminihound> Same with Darkest dungeon 2, play a bit and LET IT BE for a good 2 years. doogSnooze
[2022-12-11 15:00:26] <$SparksV> It's also kind of an interesting and cool way of episodic storytelling, you get more bosses and lore once in a few months and can play and explore however much you want until the next big patch
[2022-12-11 15:00:46] <%W_Tile> it happens
[2022-12-11 15:00:46] <%$stachystat> Oh they're doing a sequel to slime rancher aren't they. I thought you liked the first one.
[2022-12-11 15:01:01] <%+jareel99> Sometimes I'm hype for a game and when I get it I just bounce off it and can never really get into it.

[2022-12-11 15:02:36] <RMutt1917> @jazzjackrabbit unfortunately some games rely on early access in order to fund the completion of the game
[2022-12-11 15:02:52] <+Nyxceris> @Dexbonus I had to do the same haha. Turned off the crimson court (but kept the extra class), played on Radiant mode, and used the wiki for advice on how to beat bosses lol. And I loved every second of it
