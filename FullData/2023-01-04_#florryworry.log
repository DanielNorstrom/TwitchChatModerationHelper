[2023-01-04 16:51:43] <%tolstoyyyy> @Elrassel its good, but not as good as everybody said. Nolan makes fine mainstream action-thriller-esque movies, but whenever he gets philosophical,  it goes to shit. he isnt good at writing dialogue or communicating complex ideas. so when he tries to go deep, it falls on its face.
