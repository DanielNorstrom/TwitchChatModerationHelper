[2023-01-10 08:25:00] <%LordOverflow> They should watch Lethalfrag. I think these days he might swear a bit. But before he had his own words replacing swear words
[2023-01-10 08:25:10] <MerasMacLeod> A lot of things are related to advertisers not wanting their brand to show next to swearing.
[2023-01-10 08:25:19] <%LordOverflow> So it was always family friendly content
[2023-01-10 08:25:46] <MerasMacLeod> Something like 80% of YT ads are from 3 agencies.

[2023-01-10 08:34:31] <MerasMacLeod> There are very few companies big enough to fight the "walled Garden" in iOS (and less so android)
[2023-01-10 08:34:31] <%450gButter> Hello everyone
[2023-01-10 08:35:00] <%LordOverflow> Google settled with Epic. Apple no clue
[2023-01-10 08:35:04] <%+bedzi95> epic i think
[2023-01-10 08:35:38] <%+bedzi95> there is no fortnite on ios store
[2023-01-10 08:35:48] <MerasMacLeod> Apple were forced to allow devs to push people to external payments platforms, but did not reach the requirement to be a monopoly

[2023-01-10 08:37:19] <%grimuletz> @bedzi95 they pulled it, that's how it started
[2023-01-10 08:37:31] <%grimuletz> because apple was charging for their transactions too much
[2023-01-10 08:37:37] <MerasMacLeod> Epic kinda gain from not having it on iOS, removed one more dev platform
[2023-01-10 08:37:47] <%LordOverflow> I think the goal is bringing Epic Store to iOS/Android
[2023-01-10 08:37:50] VIEWERS: 151
[2023-01-10 08:38:02] <%LordOverflow> but for mobile games
[2023-01-10 08:38:05] <MerasMacLeod> I dont think iOS would allow it
[2023-01-10 08:38:27] <kingkaisarr> long time no see doc
[2023-01-10 08:38:29] <MerasMacLeod> EGS app on Android could be a thing, but iOS require you to put apps on the App Store
[2023-01-10 08:38:30] <%+bedzi95> i dont think so bc apple would loose money
[2023-01-10 08:39:16] <%LordOverflow> If you stream it, it's easier to help/roast you :P

[2023-01-10 10:01:00] <@%sateenvarjokauppias> yea getting full lasercorps isnt easy.
[2023-01-10 10:02:10] <%LordOverflow> I clicked the long one with 200 views. Why? It was elderly person so I knew it's not ADHD speed and also it was on my language (which didn't really matter)

[2023-01-10 10:29:10] <pigeon_boy12> You are missing the hs overlay which makes us able to see the cards on stream :D
[2023-01-10 10:29:12] <pigeon_boy12> @P4wnyhof
[2023-01-10 10:29:31] <Thorlar> Yeah, I see that overlay myself
[2023-01-10 10:29:31] <%+bedzi95> but u could get the summoned golden :D
[2023-01-10 10:29:40] <pigeon_boy12> Cant see it even after refresh
[2023-01-10 10:29:41] <Thorlar> And I'm great, lots of fun projects going on. How are you doing P4wnyhof? :D
[2023-01-10 10:29:52] <pigeon_boy12> Might be only me :D
[2023-01-10 10:29:58] <Thorlar> Did you accidentally disable it pigeon_boy12?
[2023-01-10 10:30:02] <%badvalentin3> @hevakhevak that is unit level, so at the end of the round, if you win you do damage that equals your lvl (max 6) added to the board cumulative levels, so  lvl 2 unit will add 2 damage
[2023-01-10 10:30:06] <Thorlar> Ohhhh, I'd love to check out your projects P4wnyhof!
[2023-01-10 10:30:13] <pigeon_boy12> Dont think so @Thorlar

[2023-01-10 12:33:32] <%D3aDsH0TSS> it does, you get 1 gold for each minion
[2023-01-10 12:33:40] <%+RoctarStarHawk> so you can get like 30 gold in a turn

[2023-01-10 13:42:38] <yamiwk> the one where they stray too far from the original sorce and henry cavill and the director doing smear campaign on him

[2023-01-10 13:44:43] <+DaBlop> I am a bit sad Henry Cavill is too old for 007

[2023-01-10 13:45:57] <%+Evewhiran> can you see what Bond is cooking?
[2023-01-10 13:45:58] <+Nagwag> would watch the rock as james bond
[2023-01-10 13:45:59] <%+Its__Arkz> Cavil is 15 years you get than Daniel Craig’s? How is too old?
[2023-01-10 13:46:21] <+DaBlop> Daniel was 38 when starting out as Bond, no clue, they also had older ones
[2023-01-10 13:46:21] <%LordOverflow> He kinda is. Red Notice is pretty close to James Bonds
[2023-01-10 13:46:24] <%+Dockain> The people's Bond
[2023-01-10 13:46:35] <@%sateenvarjokauppias> Dwayne "the rock" johnsson starring in Johnny english would be more like it
[2023-01-10 13:46:35] <%+Its__Arkz> Idris Elba

[2023-01-10 13:48:23] <%LordOverflow> Clint Eastwood

[2023-01-10 13:48:31] <yamiwk> scarlet Johansson as bond
[2023-01-10 13:48:39] <+IcyDj> tom hiddleston?
[2023-01-10 13:48:46] <%+kelvasco> As great as Daniel Craig was he went for so long that we've missed lots of great actors being the options, no idea who will get it now
[2023-01-10 13:48:59] <+Delicioussaw> the ultimate pogchamp would be Nic Cage
[2023-01-10 13:49:03] <%LordOverflow> Next is probably Jane Bond or did they do that already?
[2023-01-10 13:49:34] <ninterz> On another note Robert Downy Jr would be a very good James Bond. He was a very good Sherlock

[2023-01-10 14:36:11] <@%sateenvarjokauppias> Im comming! need can play like 1 or 2 games before i need to pick up kiddo
[2023-01-10 14:36:11] <Deathsenemy666> and jetsky :P
[2023-01-10 14:36:21] <Stiglar> yeah I have. WoT and WoW. I have Tier 8s in both..but got bored a long time
[2023-01-10 14:36:46] <Stiglar> and world of warships I have played a lot on mobile also (that's where I started with wow)
[2023-01-10 14:37:10] <Deathsenemy666> are there submarines aswell?
[2023-01-10 14:37:50] <@%sateenvarjokauppias> Submarines are the cancer of this game.. worst thing they have come up with for a long time and they cant see whats wrong with them yet so no fix..
[2023-01-10 14:37:54] VIEWERS: 525
[2023-01-10 14:38:10] <Stiglar> what I realised about both of these games is that the most fun is between t2/3 - t5 (t6 max).  t7/8 is really frustrating and maybe t9/t10 is fun..but never got there and I'm not going to buy a tank or ship for 50$ or how much is one..

[2023-01-10 14:41:23] <%LordOverflow> @Stiglar I have 3 t10 artillery tanks in WoT as f2p and yeah it took a while :D
[2023-01-10 14:41:41] <%LordOverflow> 1 t10 2 t9 i meant

[2023-01-10 14:42:11] <Stiglar> t10 in wow doesn't look that fun
[2023-01-10 14:42:57] <Stiglar> in wot seems a bit more fun (especially with light tanks/mids) but I grinded german/russians tanks and just couldn't get to t9

[2023-01-10 14:43:30] <@%sateenvarjokauppias> @LordOverflow @Stiglar i have 44 t10 tanks and almost 7k matches in them and i can say its the most fun tier to play in. in wows im only at t6 on normal ships and its getting more fun by tier
[2023-01-10 14:43:31] <Stiglar> if I remember well the french t9 or t10 light are very fun since they're so small and fast but..couldn't get there :(

[2023-01-10 14:44:50] <%richcritter> only works on subs
[2023-01-10 14:44:53] <Stiglar> artillery was fun in wot but you need a decent team else you get flanked and killed right away
[2023-01-10 14:45:10] <%LordOverflow> Counter artillery is even more fun ;)
[2023-01-10 14:45:33] <Stiglar> @LordOverflow 100% I remember I was hunting them :D
