[2022-12-31 01:45:30] <%Sapper04> worth checking
[2022-12-31 01:45:37] VIEWERS: 1 500
[2022-12-31 01:45:45] <%Sapper04> you need to go to the bridge thats on 5th floor near the 48 building
[2022-12-31 01:45:50] <%haydayeu> fuck me that was awesome
[2022-12-31 01:45:55] <%+MajorPainCA> The underpass is actually a rooftop pass
[2022-12-31 01:45:57] <NoZero26> bonjour comment sa va
[2022-12-31 01:46:06] <%loveu24fr> the underpass key is for the door on top of the building 46
[2022-12-31 01:46:08] <%loveu24fr> check wiki
[2022-12-31 01:46:12] <%Crawlern> up to the left on the right side below the window
[2022-12-31 01:46:17] <%+MajorPainCA> Your key goes to 48 primorvski
[2022-12-31 01:46:21] <%goldenknight22> its the pharmacy you went to before, where you kicked the door down
[2022-12-31 01:46:22] <%Sapper04> its the building next to the pharmacy building there is a bridge connecting the two and the key opens that door
[2022-12-31 01:46:24] <%ObsceneSanity> @gingy read the blue squares on the outside of the buildings for addresses
[2022-12-31 01:46:31] <%+MajorPainCA> Around the cafe I think
[2022-12-31 01:46:38] <%loveu24fr> remember the door you kicked next to building 48
[2022-12-31 01:46:58] <%Sapper04> youve been up there gingy its the really high up overpass (Not underpass)

[2022-12-31 20:04:08] <@%+jimmiedrum> no idea @gerberbaby4 , haven't seen anyone get further than the sledge thing, and after that was done it said something about mud and corpses
[2022-12-31 20:04:08] <%eeeasybreeeze> So whats the story with sledgehammer and that wall in your hideout?
[2022-12-31 20:04:20] <MtnDrewTV> Hey Gingy! Hey chat!
[2022-12-31 20:04:21] <Darcir> Scavs have been nasty lately, dunno if they boosted them or something.
[2022-12-31 20:04:26] <@%+2L33Zy> Not one pellet that’s gotta be a bug
[2022-12-31 20:04:27] <billyb0n3s> it was poison pellet
[2022-12-31 20:04:35] <%$MagicMeech> one shotgun pellet is equivalent to getting hit with 9mm
[2022-12-31 20:04:36] <%Gerberbaby4> @jimmiedrum I see, I thought we had to mop first before we could upgrade, but I've never mopped and it's letting me use the sledgehammer
[2022-12-31 20:04:38] <%$MagicMeech> it would hurt
[2022-12-31 20:04:42] <oMORENOo> U r the best female in the game?
[2022-12-31 20:04:45] <M3rkyyy> probably lack of skill kappa
[2022-12-31 20:04:52] <%$MagicMeech> and if shoot in the perfect point could remove a arm
[2022-12-31 20:04:53] <kane3124> it barely touched u

[2022-12-31 20:29:44] <fuggz> i think they mean because of keybinds
[2022-12-31 20:29:45] <iacewheeler> Who would want to use controller anyway 😭😭
[2022-12-31 20:29:48] <CWilliams618> tarkov will never go to console or if it does it has to be non crossover

[2022-12-31 20:29:56] <delusional_technologies> M&K support on console is all they need
[2022-12-31 20:30:01] <+saltyscoobs> that would be open season baby

At one point which I don't remember, I stopped caring. That kinda carried over to Tarkov as I came back this wipe.

[2022-12-31 22:30:49] <%Carrionx> the lag on streets is a little inconsistent yeah. yesterday i had it one raid and not the next.
[2022-12-31 22:30:51] <%+MajorPainCA> It was Burgerz fault.  lol
[2022-12-31 22:30:51] <%parenthesisrl> gpu isnt used by tarky

[2022-12-31 22:31:12] <@%IGotBurgerz> @MajorPainCA PROBABLY
[2022-12-31 22:31:14] <%Slabu> yeah, Gingy's Nvidia settings makes stuff so much easy to see ingame
[2022-12-31 22:31:15] <%Carrionx> when i upgraded from 16-32 it helepd with loading time so i'd recommend it
[2022-12-31 22:31:20] <+A1rbanas> @Gingy what resolution do you use?
[2022-12-31 22:31:27] <MandatedEnd88> Make sure you redo driver and the tarkov installer if you have issues. I had stutters and black screen blinks after the new update
[2022-12-31 22:31:35] <@%+jimmiedrum> considering how much he had going on, not surprised
[2022-12-31 22:31:49] <%+mr_ax> ... so not 64gb then?
[2022-12-31 22:32:01] <@%+jimmiedrum> I mean, 64 wouldn't hurt
[2022-12-31 22:32:07] <+Damon_Afta> turning up brightness in nvidia control panel
[2022-12-31 22:32:09] <%+tugghboat> running more than 32 requires bios tweeking with windos ``

[2022-12-31 22:32:11] <+Tzakol_original> better to get 32gb at a higher speed
[2022-12-31 22:32:13] <%+tugghboat> windows11*
[2022-12-31 22:32:19] <%Carrionx> i'd say minimum 32 is where you want to be
