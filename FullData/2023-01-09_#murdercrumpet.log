[2023-01-09 02:53:29] <%ItsRott> Dude, something about the pants coming off is just amazing to me. Like why is this cat so addicted to taking off their pants? Everytime I tune into Rob's stream I search for CGE to see them take off their pants. It's not even being down bad, its hypnotic when they drop them like 'wow, excellent form and grace dropping the pants that time!' It's such a power move too, how can one catgirl have so much power over my brain with a virtual pair of pants? I am a proud CGE taking their pants off enjoyer
