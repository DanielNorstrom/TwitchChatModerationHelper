[2023-01-04 14:25:42] <%+heisenberk717> @fyynney interesting that this is faster, never occurred to me. Do they use invis potions for the rooms? I have to leave in 10m so I will probably not see it

[2023-01-04 14:48:46] <%+Zulfasaurus> @sauronthebadass every 75s in combat you get the buff, if you dont dispell tih opposite its a 3s stun and big dam

[2023-01-04 14:48:52] <corecollapse8> because some emissaries were so stupid

[2023-01-04 16:25:52] <primemnster> I feel like they need to increase the thundering duration. give you more opportunities to clear
[2023-01-04 16:25:52] <@%+Karmacodee> it would be fine if the tank only got the one debuff

[2023-01-04 16:26:48] <primemnster> maybe make it so each person gets the same debuff the entire dungeon so you can always clear the same way

[2023-01-04 16:47:28] <thv_> So I’ve been trying to figure out why I drop frames super hard in raid. I drop to like 15fps on Raz, does anyone have suggestions because I have a pretty good pc. I downloaded Elvui a while back and am now having issues. Does anyone think uninstalling it would fix it
[2023-01-04 16:47:41] <ncw86> is naowh spamming ignore pain or revenge ?

[2023-01-04 19:55:44] <+TripleXTN> Just a reminder that Frost sims higher than Arcane on single target and is arguably better in this key because of pull size
[2023-01-04 19:55:51] <+D4ryonXD> Is that a Weakaura which says kick, dodge, etc?
[2023-01-04 19:56:05] <Reebode> is the UI for all classes?
[2023-01-04 19:56:06] <+CallMeHadoken> @Raptorskulz did i say they are the same? i said they are all good.

[2023-01-04 19:57:24] <%Raptorskulz> @CallMeHadoken i don't think they're bad, i just know arcane is quite a bit better and should be played in a key this high, esp on tyran weeks lmfao
[2023-01-04 19:57:31] <arie_3> @CallMeHadoken probably a fotm roller who just sees arcane so it must be bis LUL
[2023-01-04 19:58:03] <%Raptorskulz> @CallMeHadoken i mean i've been mage since i started playing in BFA and gotten CE for the last like 6 raids with it so npenSHRUG
[2023-01-04 19:58:10] <+Badpagsgaming> fire can burst just as high as arcane tho\

[2023-01-04 20:01:36] <+CallMeHadoken> its not ofc, but ive played mage every expansion since then
