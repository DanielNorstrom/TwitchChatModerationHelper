[2023-01-11 09:31:01] <%steeldeity06> it destroys one enemy card and it counts for death
[2023-01-11 09:31:01] <Iwilljoy> Moon girl will be good to copy Deadpoll or Demons. Prof X is Troll here IMO

[2023-01-11 09:33:08] <Iwilljoy> I dont like Hulkbuster here, your choice
[2023-01-11 09:33:10] <%steeldeity06> I'm gonna be honest with you a destroy deck without wave is not gonna do it. but let's try it out
[2023-01-11 09:33:13] <kr3du> its good af with hot location
[2023-01-11 09:33:20] <+monkykap> Polaris could be good

[2023-01-11 09:33:21] <%steeldeity06> !card wave
[2023-01-11 09:33:21] <@Hiketron> Wave | 3/3 | Series 3 | On Reveal: Next turn, cards in both players' hands cost 4
[2023-01-11 09:33:22] <Ezras> forge is easier for curve
[2023-01-11 09:33:29] <Ezras> for deadpool
[2023-01-11 09:33:32] <@%zubedoo> I just killmonger last say and bye bye deadpool PepeLaugh
[2023-01-11 09:33:34] <%+TVkun2> I like this version of the deck.
[2023-01-11 09:33:55] <Ezras> yay
[2023-01-11 09:33:57] <Iwilljoy> Lets try, after that you can make some changes
[2023-01-11 09:33:59] <+Jekkfje> it looks good tbh
[2023-01-11 09:34:01] <%steeldeity06> are you sure you don't have wave? you keep forgetting KEKW
[2023-01-11 09:34:04] <Ezras> all your missing is she hulk and wave
[2023-01-11 09:34:09] <Ezras> or aero and the deck is meta
[2023-01-11 09:34:11] <%+TVkun2> @zubedoo but with altar of death you can put deadpool there every turn for +1 energy pretty much
[2023-01-11 09:34:34] <@%zubedoo> I mean yeah thats the meta for sure next 2 days
[2023-01-11 09:34:37] <%steeldeity06> waaaiitt

[2023-01-11 10:00:22] <%Iwilljoy> So everybody gonna play Death like with Lamantis-1

[2023-01-11 10:46:12] <notamug445> pretty different. costs one more, sucks at eating hood, rocks, goblins
[2023-01-11 10:46:28] <+kisho_> carnage is the best one
[2023-01-11 10:46:40] <%+xspectrum7> Venom works really well with some of the locations like nidavelir and throne room @spyro_za
[2023-01-11 10:46:47] <kr3du> it's not better or worse, depends on the porpuse and what u destroying
[2023-01-11 10:46:49] <BlackStarLightning> With task master no venom is better
[2023-01-11 10:47:01] <+kisho_> the 2 cost is busted, it might be nerfed in future

[2023-01-11 11:34:28] <quantoll> Some are new, most of them were datamined long time ago
[2023-01-11 11:34:59] <Ezras> I wanted to show you them to see what you thought
[2023-01-11 11:35:05] <quantoll> Most of those cards actually release without changes, with few exceptions, so this list is pretty acurate

[2023-01-11 12:05:15] <%steeldeity06> these are P1 cards you do have them

[2023-01-11 12:06:28] <xsneiper> Without mystique you can’t run this deck
[2023-01-11 12:06:30] <%Iwilljoy> In case you dont draw ultron, Yes. Maybe cut ooff something big for Doom
[2023-01-11 12:06:30] <quantoll> Looks good
[2023-01-11 12:06:38] <%steeldeity06> yess. you atleast need some backup targets for him.

[2023-01-11 12:06:59] <%Iwilljoy> I rather play Mysterio and cut Cyclop
[2023-01-11 12:07:05] <safaryman> this deck is not that good without mystic tho
[2023-01-11 12:07:25] <%Iwilljoy> @safaryman onslaught can make it

[2023-01-11 14:09:28] <+Jekkfje> series 4 downgrades to series 4 every month so it honestly doesn't matter unless ur impatient
[2023-01-11 14:09:40] <LeTrelleChan> yeah but you get more tokens when you finish pool 3
[2023-01-11 14:09:41] <%+merlincrh> If you get to pool 4 the average tokens upgrades to 400 per cache
[2023-01-11 14:09:41] <Robinkewl> idk, once you finish pool 3 you get 4x as many tokens from Reserves.... how do you think about that @Spyro_ZA
[2023-01-11 14:09:42] <+Jekkfje> they just announced series 5 and 4 being downgraded
[2023-01-11 14:09:47] <%+merlincrh> So it goes way faster
[2023-01-11 14:09:54] <quantoll> If you're into minmaxing then it is better, but it's a lot more slower and boring
[2023-01-11 14:09:57] <+Vincuu> it depends, it takes like over 2 months to get through series 3 without spending money so if there's a substantially great card to fill your deck to help you win it's wortth getting it
[2023-01-11 14:10:05] <erri__> tbf you get more tokens after completing pool 3 but i haven't done the math

[2023-01-11 14:11:17] <+Mugshade> faster u finish pool 3 faster you get x4 tokens
[2023-01-11 14:11:18] <Robinkewl> you make more currency when Pool 3 finishes and theoretically pool4 and pool5 downgrade eventually. seems like finishing pool3 is correct
[2023-01-11 14:11:40] <erri__> only these on screen
[2023-01-11 14:11:45] <+Vincuu> I'd say when you are very early into pool 3, getting some useful/universal cards like leader/aero might be good to get. Once you have a solid deck, I'd hold onto tokens (coming from someone close to 3k cl)
[2023-01-11 14:11:49] <Robinkewl> the official discord recommends not purchasing pool3 but havent shown me the math to back that up yet
[2023-01-11 14:12:39] <@^StreamElements> Thank you for following lBobrDobrl :)
[2023-01-11 14:12:53] <+Jekkfje> now that we have news on downgrading scheme which they said is monthly it's objectively better to buy series 3 unless you REALLY want a specific series 4/5 card
[2023-01-11 14:12:57] VIEWERS: 293
[2023-01-11 14:13:03] <Mithfin> finishing pool 3 takes forever. My CL is like 2100 and I still have several pool 3 cards missing. So it is okay to buy key pool 3 cards like Wave, Aero or Octopus, which are imperative for several archetypes.
[2023-01-11 14:13:24] <Robinkewl> octopus? what archetype is that?
[2023-01-11 14:13:25] <+Benelioto> octopus ? KEKWait

[2023-01-11 14:17:18] <%Iwilljoy> Probably yes, I spent tokens on 3 series cards and kinda regreated it

[2023-01-11 14:23:14] <%Iwilljoy> Prof X is low body power. Spiderman better IMO
[2023-01-11 14:23:16] <@+QuillandLance> i mean you can expect pro x with daredevil and if you split lanes well before turn 5 you can brick it
[2023-01-11 14:23:20] <+Vincuu> seems good until you don't draw this combo for many games or draw them too late into the game etc
