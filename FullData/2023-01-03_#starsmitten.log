[2023-01-03 00:03:46] <%+T3mplarr> celiShrug
[2023-01-03 00:03:58] <%ManiaFreak> T3mplarr no idea what they were called but... pork meat bun, 2 types of shrimp dumplings, pork dumpling, steamed broccoli dish, chinese donuts
[2023-01-03 00:04:40] <%ManiaFreak> they also ordered chicken feet and tripe
[2023-01-03 00:04:43] <%ManiaFreak> didn't touch that
[2023-01-03 00:05:23] <%+T3mplarr> peepoGiggle
[2023-01-03 00:06:07] <%ManiaFreak> the chicken feet were HUGE
[2023-01-03 00:06:41] <%Cemused> chicken feet? monkaS
[2023-01-03 00:06:49] <%ManiaFreak> yup
[2023-01-03 00:07:01] <%+T3mplarr> yeee
[2023-01-03 00:07:07] <%+T3mplarr> I don't like chicken feet either
[2023-01-03 00:07:13] <%+T3mplarr> but more so just it's annoying to eat
[2023-01-03 00:07:16] <%+T3mplarr> rather than taste
[2023-01-03 00:07:22] <%+T3mplarr> taste it's pretty good
[2023-01-03 00:07:39] <%ManiaFreak> i think if it was more like korean chicken feet/ smaller i would have tried it
[2023-01-03 00:07:47] <%+T3mplarr> the buns are good, they are called baos
[2023-01-03 00:07:58] <%+T3mplarr> chinese donuts are goated
[2023-01-03 00:08:07] <%+T3mplarr> deep fried goodness celiNom
[2023-01-03 00:08:12] <%ManiaFreak> yeh oh they also ordered a bbq pork bun?
[2023-01-03 00:08:19] <%+T3mplarr> celiNice
[2023-01-03 00:08:19] <%ManiaFreak> and a pineapple one
[2023-01-03 00:08:23] <%+T3mplarr> pineapple HUH
[2023-01-03 00:08:29] <%+T3mplarr> never seen that before
[2023-01-03 00:08:29] <%ManiaFreak> yeah....
[2023-01-03 00:08:35] <%+T3mplarr> that's weird
[2023-01-03 00:08:55] <%+T3mplarr> did you get like these rice noodle dishes
[2023-01-03 00:09:10] <%+T3mplarr> they are like these big rolls
[2023-01-03 00:09:11] <%ManiaFreak> NOPERS
[2023-01-03 00:09:15] <%+T3mplarr> damn Sadge
[2023-01-03 00:09:17] <%+T3mplarr> those are the best
[2023-01-03 00:09:21] <%ManiaFreak> The menu didn't have them
[2023-01-03 00:09:25] <%+T3mplarr> HUH
[2023-01-03 00:09:38] <%+T3mplarr> they are one of the most popular food items in dim sum

[2023-01-03 00:10:16] <%ManiaFreak> oh nvm apparently it had to be ordered separate
[2023-01-03 00:10:27] <%ManiaFreak> oh yeah we had those
[2023-01-03 00:10:36] <%+T3mplarr> these are the best YEP
[2023-01-03 00:10:52] <%+T3mplarr> celiNom I get at least 4 orders of these when I go celiNom
[2023-01-03 00:12:02] <%ManiaFreak> i think favorite thing was the pork rolls
[2023-01-03 00:12:14] <%ManiaFreak> was very surprised by how sweet they were though
[2023-01-03 00:16:55] <%+T3mplarr> NODDERS might have been the soy sauce, dim sum places like to give out sweet soy sauce with those rolls
[2023-01-03 00:17:08] <%+T3mplarr> enhances the flavour celiNom

[2023-01-03 00:42:35] <@%TriCat> I like the back story though. The creators of the anime loved the manga so much that they kept asking when they could start making the anime
[2023-01-03 00:42:55] <@%TriCat> They had no restrictions on the anime and had freedom to do lots with it celiWee
[2023-01-03 00:42:59] <%+T3mplarr> the only upsetting part about manga is when the translations stop randomly Awkward

[2023-01-03 02:41:20] <%Ktizila> is very similar to restro durid  you throw down a totem like your mushrooms and spam heal

[2023-01-03 03:03:58] <eionda> you use that if you want to run while casting
[2023-01-03 03:03:59] <jhaaxx> Use shimmer, its much more comfy
[2023-01-03 03:04:01] <cptscuttlebutt> to run and cast arcane blast fx
[2023-01-03 03:04:02] <+ssbm_CK> but idk if you use it
[2023-01-03 03:04:07] <초심으로 (yellow_poong)> shimmer is better in mythic
[2023-01-03 03:04:19] <eionda> ice floes is really good, but you have to be advance with it

[2023-01-03 03:04:27] <eionda> can stick with shimmer while you learn your class
[2023-01-03 03:04:28] <aderin> it's preference. some people use ice floes some people use shimmer. I'm a shimmer addict myself
[2023-01-03 03:04:33] <jhaaxx> That is the blink, and you can do it while casting

[2023-01-03 03:04:59] <%KuruzuRei> i heard shimmer removes stun removal tho
[2023-01-03 03:05:09] <%sevekk> blink was my fav mage spell celiLuv
[2023-01-03 03:05:10] <초심으로 (yellow_poong)> i think that's pvp
[2023-01-03 03:05:11] <eionda> cast and just blink
[2023-01-03 03:05:13] <thatoneguykyle> u moved
[2023-01-03 03:05:25] <jhaaxx> That is what i mean
[2023-01-03 03:05:35] <eionda> you have to be aiming at your target
[2023-01-03 03:05:35] <jhaaxx> With regular blink its stops your cast
[2023-01-03 03:05:35] <thatoneguykyle> no u lost line of sight
[2023-01-03 03:05:36] <%+chauroon> you can cast and use it but you were facing the wrong way when you blinked
[2023-01-03 03:05:37] <jhaaxx> Yes it did lmao
[2023-01-03 03:05:39] <+AmyElusi> just gotta ensure you're still facing the target and it'll go off
[2023-01-03 03:05:51] <FaultyOne> it takes some getting used to

[2023-01-03 03:06:08] <jhaaxx> Regular blink stops your cast, but on the upside it removes cc

[2023-01-03 03:12:56] <jhaaxx> And then there are stuns / cc / Silence
[2023-01-03 03:12:59] <%TheBenShee> a tank told me to spot cleave dps once in a cleave dps fight because it makes me take more dmg... tell that to a class, that only cleaves as dps in melee KEKW

[2023-01-03 03:13:04] <+AmyElusi> melee tend to have lower cd but kick means interrupt generally
[2023-01-03 03:13:05] <%TheBenShee> also it wasn't true
[2023-01-03 03:13:07] <jhaaxx> Its just what they grew into
[2023-01-03 03:13:08] <SecondChildren> not same
[2023-01-03 03:13:09] <Dawn_NG> kick is rogue’s interrupt abilitys name
[2023-01-03 03:13:10] <%itsClubby> Kick is the blanket term for interrupt
[2023-01-03 03:13:10] <Sarsflu> kick annd silence and counter spell are all interrupts, which purely stop spell casts.
[2023-01-03 03:13:12] <%stalkingpeopleontwitch> kick is interrupt. its a rogue skill that it just caught up
[2023-01-03 03:13:14] <%KuruzuRei> stun and kick are different
[2023-01-03 03:13:14] <FaultyOne> @starsmitten are you a blood elf? If so Arcane torrent is a kick as well
[2023-01-03 03:13:16] <@^Fossabot> Subscribe to Celine's YouTube channel! Go watch her latest video: girls love shiny cube things - https://youtu.be/KMthMek7sew
[2023-01-03 03:13:21] <fenitsz> kick is the rogue interrupt abillity, for melees interrupt has 12 sec of CD but for ranges is much larger
[2023-01-03 03:13:24] <jhaaxx> Because kick is faster to say/type
[2023-01-03 03:13:26] <cptscuttlebutt> its just odd that people call alot of things a kick even thou its just 1 class that its called kick on
[2023-01-03 03:13:31] <%KuruzuRei> @FaultyOne no its not
[2023-01-03 03:13:35] <Sarsflu> stuns/fears are crowd controls, which stop them from doing all normal actions
[2023-01-03 03:13:35] <%KuruzuRei> thats changed
[2023-01-03 03:13:35] <%dnasis_> i wonder how many people i confuse when i refer to "2 chesting" or "3 chesting" a key
[2023-01-03 03:13:37] <Vodkahawk> you can stun and because the mob is stunned it will stop the spell
[2023-01-03 03:13:44] <storm99413> stun = cc
[2023-01-03 03:13:45] <%+Fugeki> @starsmitten kick interrupt is the same it just stops spell casting stun completely ccs the target
[2023-01-03 03:13:52] <%dnasis_> arcane torrent is an aoe dispel
[2023-01-03 03:13:55] <+ZinBoi> Kick = Interrupt Silence = Interrupt + Silence Stun = Can't do anything Root = unable to move
[2023-01-03 03:13:56] <fenitsz> 15 sec my bad, sham is 12 sec
[2023-01-03 03:13:57] <%KuruzuRei> arcane torrent is a purge
[2023-01-03 03:14:00] <+AmyElusi> ooooh spellsteal as well - that's a fun one
[2023-01-03 03:14:04] <jhaaxx> That is a aoe dispel
[2023-01-03 03:14:11] <+AmyElusi> dang i forgot how cool mages are
[2023-01-03 03:14:13] <%dnasis_> purge/dispel, whatever
[2023-01-03 03:14:22] <%KuruzuRei> it USED to interrurt
[2023-01-03 03:14:32] <Chrommux> think that is to make it easier to  distinguish who is going to do interrupts etc.
[2023-01-03 03:14:42] <cptscuttlebutt> its used the same way as dragons breath
[2023-01-03 03:14:43] <FaultyOne> @KuruzuRei ah sorry yeah been awhile since I played horde
[2023-01-03 03:14:45] <%KuruzuRei> yeah
[2023-01-03 03:14:45] <%dnasis_> blast wave can be very useful during sanguine
[2023-01-03 03:14:46] <jhaaxx> Its to push mobs away
[2023-01-03 03:14:48] VIEWERS: 1 235
[2023-01-03 03:14:49] <cptscuttlebutt> its to stop   casts
[2023-01-03 03:14:50] <aderin> it's been pretty useful for sanguine
[2023-01-03 03:14:53] <Okiesmokie> blast wave is good for keys when there's sanguine
[2023-01-03 03:14:55] <jhaaxx> Its very useful on sanguine weeks
[2023-01-03 03:15:02] <naturalduck> its for knocking people off the lumber mill cliff
[2023-01-03 03:15:03] <aderin> yes
[2023-01-03 03:15:04] <Lummy0> YEP
[2023-01-03 03:15:04] <%itsClubby> You can also use it tactically to move mobs
[2023-01-03 03:15:05] <fenitsz> yup u could use that to interrupt casts as well
[2023-01-03 03:15:07] <fenitsz> yeeees
[2023-01-03 03:15:11] <Xageos> its a small knockback
[2023-01-03 03:15:13] <%KuruzuRei> ohhh
[2023-01-03 03:15:17] <thatoneguykyle> its nice but the knock back is almost nothing, other classes have much better ones
[2023-01-03 03:15:21] <eionda> useless for arcane
[2023-01-03 03:15:21] <%S3rp3nt_007> WatchingStream
[2023-01-03 03:15:21] <%KuruzuRei> situational i dont use it
[2023-01-03 03:15:23] <%dnasis_> its basically the same use as death grip or ping of peace yes
[2023-01-03 03:15:24] <cptscuttlebutt> it moves mobs so if you need to stop casts it can move them and interupt the cast
[2023-01-03 03:15:25] <jhaaxx> Its aoe slow
[2023-01-03 03:15:27] <FaultyOne> it slows so its sometimes helpful
[2023-01-03 03:15:31] <jhaaxx> For the tank, or open world
[2023-01-03 03:15:33] <Sarsflu> its a slow to help kite
[2023-01-03 03:15:36] <Xageos> aoe slow
[2023-01-03 03:15:38] <%dnasis_> cone of cold is a weak slow, its more useful for frost mages
[2023-01-03 03:15:38] <jhaaxx> You generally dont unless the tanks needs it
[2023-01-03 03:15:38] <Cymron> There is a few different abilities that CC Mobs - There is something called a Diminishing Return so, if you can't for example perma stun something. So there are Incaps, Disorients, Roots, Silences, Stun ett
[2023-01-03 03:15:40] <Sarsflu> either yourself, or possibly your tank i guess
[2023-01-03 03:15:41] <+AmyElusi> cone of cold you probably will use closer to never as arcane, but maybe useful for kiting in M+
[2023-01-03 03:15:43] <%SanjiMagi> kiting purposes
[2023-01-03 03:15:46] <%stalkingpeopleontwitch> its got a cool fx too LUL
[2023-01-03 03:15:46] <fenitsz> not too many times tho
[2023-01-03 03:15:53] <aderin> I don't use that ever really lol
[2023-01-03 03:15:54] <fenitsz> situational spell
[2023-01-03 03:16:00] <%KuruzuRei> to be fair its a stronger slow
[2023-01-03 03:16:02] <Sarsflu> it would be something you cooredinate for sure
[2023-01-03 03:16:05] <%KuruzuRei> for 5 secs
[2023-01-03 03:16:14] <cptscuttlebutt> probably wont use CoC alot as arcane
[2023-01-03 03:16:15] <%KuruzuRei> yes
[2023-01-03 03:16:16] <Betray3dLife> Sorry if asked b4, but why did celine choose mage?

[2023-01-03 03:18:23] <eionda> but you only use it like once
[2023-01-03 03:18:24] <Chrommux> utility classes are made for women cos women can multitask better :p
[2023-01-03 03:18:31] <%KuruzuRei> situational?
[2023-01-03 03:18:33] <cptscuttlebutt> its a ranged frost nova
[2023-01-03 03:18:35] <%dnasis_> ice nova is another root
[2023-01-03 03:18:44] <+AmyElusi> there's a good macro for ice block, so you don't need to right click the buff to cancel it
[2023-01-03 03:18:46] <eionda> it does alot of damage

[2023-01-03 03:18:51] <sumthingorother> Did Celine create a new account
[2023-01-03 03:18:52] <eionda> you use ice nova in your aoe rotation
[2023-01-03 03:18:57] <+Dreldven> When you are AOEing but not in your ramp you will use it
[2023-01-03 03:19:01] <%dnasis_> a lot of these abilities will probably be helpful in m+
[2023-01-03 03:19:06] <%brickbandson> shes just on her mage @sumthingorother
[2023-01-03 03:19:12] <%dnasis_> so they're worth binding somewhere

[2023-01-03 03:19:18] <Xageos> u can cast iceblock again to get it off
[2023-01-03 03:19:19] <jhaaxx> You should macro canceling the alter time and ice block, because it can sometimes be bad not cancelling them
[2023-01-03 03:19:23] <cptscuttlebutt> you just tap the iceblock key agian ?
[2023-01-03 03:19:36] <cptscuttlebutt> i dont have a macro for tha
[2023-01-03 03:19:41] <ohyeahthatsabaseball> uhhh there's an enter after each Ice Block
[2023-01-03 03:19:46] <+AmyElusi> you tap it again and it removes the buff
[2023-01-03 03:19:52] <+AmyElusi> with the macro :)
[2023-01-03 03:19:54] <%dnasis_> nope, you have to /cancelaura
[2023-01-03 03:19:54] <mussfuss> macro
[2023-01-03 03:20:00] <%dnasis_> that macro will automate it
[2023-01-03 03:20:00] <%TheBenShee> you can ice block. wait 2 seconds and get out of ice block by clicking the ability again yes
[2023-01-03 03:20:02] <eionda> theres a macro where you can insta get out of iceblock
[2023-01-03 03:20:03] <jhaaxx> You can, but if you do it that way its on the gcd, if you macro a cancelaura its off gcd
[2023-01-03 03:20:23] <naturalduck> celine pvp when
[2023-01-03 03:20:43] <%TheBenShee> @jhaaxx that doesn't sound like it should be a thing

[2023-01-03 03:21:02] <ohyeahthatsabaseball> each "/[command]" should be in its own line
[2023-01-03 03:21:16] <jhaaxx> Dont macro it like that
[2023-01-03 03:21:18] <cptscuttlebutt> cancelaura has to be after the cast
[2023-01-03 03:21:24] <jhaaxx> Cuz if you panic smash it you will remove it instantly
[2023-01-03 03:21:39] <Vodkahawk> yea don't do that
[2023-01-03 03:21:41] <ohyeahthatsabaseball> if you have cancelaura after the cast it'll instant cancel. before cast it cancels when you press the spell again
[2023-01-03 03:21:41] <Okiesmokie> Nooo cancelaura after cast will cancel it immediately, it has to be before
[2023-01-03 03:21:45] <jhaaxx> No dont do that
[2023-01-03 03:21:50] <jhaaxx> That removes it instantly
[2023-01-03 03:21:52] <%KuruzuRei> wait
[2023-01-03 03:21:59] <Vodkahawk> you may need to sit in your block longer
[2023-01-03 03:22:03] <jhaaxx> If you want to do it on a single button do it as u had it before
[2023-01-03 03:22:09] <+AmyElusi> i mean you can panic smash it when not used to the macro but you do get used to it eventually
[2023-01-03 03:22:11] <Okiesmokie> Put it the way you had it before
[2023-01-03 03:22:26] <+AmyElusi> I didn't realise you could remove it without the macro
[2023-01-03 03:22:27] <%KuruzuRei> ok

[2023-01-03 03:22:37] <jhaaxx> But its better not to, because if you panic press it and do it twice, you will remove it instantly, its better to have 1 button to remove alter and iceblock

[2023-01-03 03:22:56] <eionda> say if youre in the middle of a cast and need to ice block
[2023-01-03 03:22:57] <polygondwanaland11> I'd just suggest that you go hit stuff and you'll find what you're missing from there
[2023-01-03 03:22:58] <eionda> itll cancel ur cast and iceblock

[2023-01-03 03:23:08] <%dnasis_> i used to have a account wide macro for /cancelaura and gave it to my mage and paladin
[2023-01-03 03:23:08] <!%countingpotato_> You would in high mythics probably
[2023-01-03 03:23:10] <polygondwanaland11> You'll figure it out
[2023-01-03 03:23:20] <ohyeahthatsabaseball> yea some people have regular iceblock and use the /cancelaura macro on their barrier spell (to avoid accidentally cancelling it)
[2023-01-03 03:23:28] <jhaaxx> Its mostly for raid, but if you want to cast to the limit, you need to spam it
[2023-01-03 03:24:06] <Okiesmokie> @jhaaxx You don't need to spam, WoW has a spell queuing system, you only have to press it once within the queue window
[2023-01-03 03:24:09] <polygondwanaland11> Exactly

[2023-01-03 03:25:35] <Murry> qt would be proud
[2023-01-03 03:25:36] <%dnasis_> your weak aura should remind you to reapply it

[2023-01-03 03:25:55] <ohyeahthatsabaseball> it is
[2023-01-03 03:25:56] <%KuruzuRei> i fi had ice floes, i would macro that one
[2023-01-03 03:25:57] <%SonnyDesu> moving cancels it, you do it after every rotation to get your next rotation faster
[2023-01-03 03:25:57] <LurkLimit> It's it
[2023-01-03 03:25:59] <eionda> very important for arcane
[2023-01-03 03:25:59] <%KuruzuRei> if i *

[2023-01-03 03:26:13] <cptscuttlebutt> some people use iceflows before shifting power to move around while they channel it
[2023-01-03 03:26:28] <polygondwanaland11> Oh its the night fae ability from shadowlands?
[2023-01-03 03:26:35] <%KuruzuRei> free dps cd
[2023-01-03 03:26:36] <jhaaxx> Thats just a defensive
[2023-01-03 03:26:36] <%SonnyDesu> mirror image is a defensive
[2023-01-03 03:26:38] <ohyeahthatsabaseball> small dps boost and keeps you from pulling aggro
[2023-01-03 03:26:43] <%KuruzuRei> oh wait
[2023-01-03 03:26:44] <%KuruzuRei> true
[2023-01-03 03:26:48] <eionda> mirror image = def cd, basically drops aggro and use your clones as decoys
[2023-01-03 03:26:48] VIEWERS: 1 282
[2023-01-03 03:26:59] <eionda> say if your tank dies and you have aggro use mirror
[2023-01-03 03:27:04] <polygondwanaland11> Mirror image is for damage reduction
[2023-01-03 03:27:06] <jhaaxx> No KEKW
[2023-01-03 03:27:08] <%SonnyDesu> you take 20% reduced damage while they are out
[2023-01-03 03:27:08] <%KuruzuRei> it distracts boss if aggrod
[2023-01-03 03:27:10] <@%TriCat> yvonWeeb
[2023-01-03 03:27:15] <%SonnyDesu> No, it is not like shadow clones, that's a monk ability
[2023-01-03 03:27:26] <!%countingpotato_> It’s more Pokémon Double Team
[2023-01-03 03:27:28] <ohyeahthatsabaseball> basically substitution jutsu i guess
[2023-01-03 03:27:35] <jhaaxx> But you may need it if you play with a bad tank, you generate less aggro when that is up
[2023-01-03 03:27:39] <cptscuttlebutt> mirror image removes you from the threat table for a little while and your images take agro , and damage reduction.
[2023-01-03 03:27:40] <polygondwanaland11> @countingpotato_ Wow the analogy
[2023-01-03 03:27:40] <%KuruzuRei> they attack when in combat

[2023-01-03 03:40:08] <%SonnyDesu> Arcane torrent is AoE and removes 1 spell effect, Spellsteal will give you the magic buff

[2023-01-03 03:40:11] <%KuruzuRei> the rock dudes in azure

[2023-01-03 03:42:05] <Chocodonut> ice nova is enough usually
[2023-01-03 03:42:12] <+AmyElusi> it may be useful in some situations, such as preventing little adds from reaching a boss
[2023-01-03 03:42:12] <%itsClubby> It’s very situational, very small amount in pve
[2023-01-03 03:42:16] <%+chauroon> rogues, shamans and mages probably have the most buttons lol
[2023-01-03 03:42:18] <vastare> you can probably ignore utility spells for a while

[2023-01-03 03:42:43] <%KuruzuRei> you can get the ice block talent that heals in ice block

[2023-01-03 03:54:50] <polygondwanaland11> First is evo
[2023-01-03 03:54:52] <Chocodonut> thats a bit further down lol
[2023-01-03 03:54:53] <%KuruzuRei> cuz magi does no dmg?
[2023-01-03 03:54:54] <polygondwanaland11> Celineeee

[2023-01-03 03:55:04] <polygondwanaland11> Try
[2023-01-03 03:55:10] <polygondwanaland11> try it
[2023-01-03 03:55:13] <jhaaxx> Its like 2 bursts, 1 for radiant spark, another for magi
[2023-01-03 03:55:24] <polygondwanaland11> Hit the dummy
[2023-01-03 03:55:30] <polygondwanaland11> YEP
[2023-01-03 03:55:33] <Chocodonut> after spark u cast 3 arcane blasts
[2023-01-03 03:55:33] <jhaaxx> So first you do your radiant spark burst, then your touch of magi burst
[2023-01-03 03:55:37] <+PaulieeB> you need to full cast evocation
[2023-01-03 03:55:38] <polygondwanaland11> And then into your dmg rotation
[2023-01-03 03:55:55] <%+rolldyy> i have a headache chat
[2023-01-03 03:55:56] <Chocodonut> u have to channel evocation fully also btw
[2023-01-03 03:56:02] <%+T3mplarr> rolldyy celiPat
[2023-01-03 03:56:09] <jhaaxx> Not for aoe
[2023-01-03 03:56:09] <%Trex6821> oh evo first because it's a channel the rune since instant
[2023-01-03 03:56:11] <Xageos> evocation its a channel spell
[2023-01-03 03:56:12] <vastare> since radiant spark and touch generate 4 charges, you can think of it as two burst windows
[2023-01-03 03:56:13] <jhaaxx> For aoe now you do the orb
[2023-01-03 03:56:17] <jhaaxx> Yes
[2023-01-03 03:56:26] <%KuruzuRei> the touch is like trist bomb on tower?
[2023-01-03 03:56:30] <jhaaxx> Because your radiant spark is increasing
[2023-01-03 03:56:34] <%mohr> this rotation WAYTOODANK
[2023-01-03 03:56:34] <jhaaxx> So the 4th spell is the strongest
[2023-01-03 03:56:37] <Chocodonut> 3 arcane blasts then arcane surge
[2023-01-03 03:56:40] <%mohr> i play monk WAYTOODANK
[2023-01-03 03:56:41] <jhaaxx> And u want the arcane surge the 4th
[2023-01-03 03:56:46] <+jivan92> so you want radian spark to stack on the target so your arcane barrage will do more dmg
[2023-01-03 03:56:47] <%silverminnow> I am already lost lmao mohr

[2023-01-03 03:57:13] <%silverminnow> LOL

[2023-01-03 03:57:26] <%TheBenShee> @starsmitten i'm telling you.. nasa degrees are easier to get KEKW
[2023-01-03 03:57:30] <jhaaxx> For aoe or st?

[2023-01-03 03:57:41] <thatoneguykyle> arcane barrage 3 times and then surge
[2023-01-03 03:57:46] <Chocodonut> 3 arcane blasts into arcane surge after spark
[2023-01-03 03:57:47] <vastare> charge x 3 then sruge
[2023-01-03 03:57:52] <%TheBenShee> @TheBenShee this was for @mohr KEKW
[2023-01-03 03:57:54] <%Khfan19> @TheBenShee Awkward
[2023-01-03 03:57:55] <thatoneguykyle> sory blasts
[2023-01-03 03:57:56] <jhaaxx> For aoe the first is arcane orb, for st its arcane blast
[2023-01-03 03:58:03] <%sunanjaya17> jahaaxx
[2023-01-03 03:58:03] <%silverminnow> We about to see a lot of purple lights? PauseChamp

[2023-01-03 03:58:06] <%+sahtras20> q x3 then z
[2023-01-03 03:58:07] <+jivan92> Radiant Spark. 3x Arcane Blast into Arcane Surge that is your setup then you go into your Touch Phase
[2023-01-03 03:58:10] <@%Mendo> there's no rotation u wanna learn the priority afaik
[2023-01-03 03:58:11] <Chocodonut> <- has played mage for 14 years
[2023-01-03 03:58:17] <%mohr> @TheBenShee KEKW
[2023-01-03 03:58:23] <%sunanjaya17> Oh
[2023-01-03 03:58:29] <%SonnyDesu> Mendo is right
[2023-01-03 03:58:31] <polygondwanaland11> The guide says arcane blast, into orb, into blast, surge
[2023-01-03 03:58:40] <%arrheniusopeth> this seems so complex LOL
[2023-01-03 03:58:43] <@%Mendo> you will have an optimal opener that might change based on procs/trinkets
[2023-01-03 03:58:45] <jhaaxx> Yes, but 1 out of 2 bursts you wont have it
[2023-01-03 03:58:46] <polygondwanaland11> Sorry i'm talking in the way you can't learn LUL
[2023-01-03 03:58:47] <@%Mendo> and then the rest is just priority
[2023-01-03 03:58:52] <%SonnyDesu> Not quite, you want to end your 4th radiant spark with your arcane barrage
[2023-01-03 03:58:56] <jhaaxx> So you need to use a different one as the 4th one
[2023-01-03 03:58:57] <Chocodonut> after you surge is when u get the 4th spark which is usually with a arcane barrage into touch
[2023-01-03 03:58:59] <%sunanjaya17> NOTED

[2023-01-03 03:59:00] <+mizentu> Evocation full cast > rune of power > arcane missiles until 20 harmony stacks > radiant spark > arcane blast 3x > arcane surge > arcane barrage > touch of the magi
[2023-01-03 03:59:06] <PixelPoro> such a dumb spec now
[2023-01-03 03:59:08] <%StelllarStella> DPS optimizers like ConRo and Hekili are a good training wheel for learning new dps classes.
[2023-01-03 03:59:09] <jhaaxx> No
[2023-01-03 03:59:16] <Chocodonut> surge is cast at 3 stacks of spark
[2023-01-03 03:59:16] <jhaaxx> Because surge is 1.5min, and rune is 45s
[2023-01-03 03:59:19] <jhaaxx> And magi is also 45s

[2023-01-03 03:59:24] <%KuruzuRei> wait wat
[2023-01-03 03:59:26] <%SonnyDesu> Barrage does more damage than surge, but surge does more damage than arcane blast
[2023-01-03 03:59:42] <%Kabmoz> you really should check out this guy's stream Celine @imfiredup

[2023-01-03 03:59:54] <%SonnyDesu> So blast until 3, then surge, then barrage for 4th and touch of magi before the barrage lands

[2023-01-03 04:00:17] <polygondwanaland11> It's going to be impossible if you want to memorize everything before doing it tho
[2023-01-03 04:00:28] <polygondwanaland11> You're a doing learner after all
[2023-01-03 04:00:30] <glife5501> isnt arcane mage bad in low keys?
[2023-01-03 04:00:41] <Chocodonut> i hate it yup
[2023-01-03 04:00:53] <@%Mendo> u just gotta get a feel for it and then learn the priority

[2023-01-03 04:01:02] <jhaaxx> After rune the 3 spells are arcane blast on st, and on aoe it gets complicated
[2023-01-03 04:01:02] <polygondwanaland11> And hit stuff
[2023-01-03 04:01:02] <%KuruzuRei> yeah
[2023-01-03 04:01:02] <@%Mendo> it's more dynamic than just learning an order of abilities
[2023-01-03 04:01:14] <polygondwanaland11> You'll do the worst the first time and only get better
[2023-01-03 04:01:19] <%sunanjaya17> YEP
[2023-01-03 04:01:20] <@%Mendo> the questions will be "should I use X even though Y is about to come off cooldown"
[2023-01-03 04:01:23] <+jivan92> Arcane Mage is rly hard to master, you need tones of EXP on it so take it slow and learn it on a dummy first
[2023-01-03 04:01:35] <@%Mendo> "Do I prioritize saving Z if I know movement is coming"
[2023-01-03 04:01:41] <themagle> YEP mages are complicated, arcane is the hardest for sure
[2023-01-03 04:01:45] <jhaaxx> Its "set"
[2023-01-03 04:01:52] <beyonetta21> just learn the basic spell order and the rest will come with experience
[2023-01-03 04:02:02] <%KuruzuRei> as long as arcane doesnt make you sleep like boomkin
[2023-01-03 04:02:02] <+Dustinferno> there is surely some guides on the class
[2023-01-03 04:02:07] <Chocodonut> just play frost celine its super simple and just pew pew all day
[2023-01-03 04:02:10] <jhaaxx> I think it would help the most trying to get through 1 rotation and giving it a go, and then seeing what went right and wrong
[2023-01-03 04:02:10] <polygondwanaland11> I play warrior I can't teach mage in any way shape or form so I'm just encouraging you to go hit things hahahah
[2023-01-03 04:02:11] <glife5501> rizzlordsean can help teach arcane?
[2023-01-03 04:02:24] <%Kabmoz> you would need to acutally get coached 1 on 1 with someone who plays it at a high level. That would expedite the proces of learning a lot
[2023-01-03 04:02:25] <%+SnoozyChris> My brain will overclock trying to understand all this abilities no cap WAYTOODANK
[2023-01-03 04:02:35] <jhaaxx> Yes
[2023-01-03 04:02:36] <jhaaxx> Never
[2023-01-03 04:02:53] <%SonnyDesu> you dont overlap them
[2023-01-03 04:02:56] <jhaaxx> Actually
[2023-01-03 04:02:56] <vastare> overcapping arcane charge is bad i think?
[2023-01-03 04:02:59] VIEWERS: 1 646
[2023-01-03 04:03:02] <%silverminnow> Why never tho?
[2023-01-03 04:03:05] <jhaaxx> Nvm, its situational, you do on aoe
[2023-01-03 04:03:07] <Chocodonut> @vastare nope
[2023-01-03 04:03:11] <jhaaxx> On aoe you do, on st you never do
[2023-01-03 04:03:12] <%SonnyDesu> And spark always goes before touch
[2023-01-03 04:03:21] <vastare> oh i see
[2023-01-03 04:03:50] <%SonnyDesu> i dont overlap on aoe or st
[2023-01-03 04:03:52] <polygondwanaland11> Sounds about right
[2023-01-03 04:03:53] <jhaaxx> Its because of arcane charges
[2023-01-03 04:04:05] <jhaaxx> Its a strange thing with radiant spark, where its not actually 4 spells, its 5
[2023-01-03 04:04:05] <%SonnyDesu> your Aoe will come from touch and missles
[2023-01-03 04:04:17] <jhaaxx> Yes
[2023-01-03 04:04:26] <jhaaxx> But its better to save it for when u need to move
[2023-01-03 04:04:48] <jhaaxx> But u can use it whenever, and just give up on dps
[2023-01-03 04:04:52] <jhaaxx> Yeah
[2023-01-03 04:04:59] VIEWERS: 1 646
[2023-01-03 04:05:00] <Chocodonut> use it when u need to move or when u want to fit more casts of arcane blast into touch dmg window as well
[2023-01-03 04:05:02] <!%countingpotato_> It’s quite reactive YEP
[2023-01-03 04:05:11] <%silverminnow> How much does moving as an arcane mage suck? Don't they have a lot of channeled spells?
[2023-01-03 04:05:13] <jhaaxx> In between bursts
[2023-01-03 04:05:14] <+jivan92> After all your CD´s
[2023-01-03 04:05:14] <+Shawnzay> after your arcane surge
[2023-01-03 04:05:16] <cptscuttlebutt> after all CDs are done
[2023-01-03 04:05:17] <jhaaxx> You have 1 burst every 45s
[2023-01-03 04:05:20] <+Shawnzay> ends
[2023-01-03 04:05:23] <%SonnyDesu> after everything
[2023-01-03 04:05:27] <Chocodonut> whenever surge ends use that
[2023-01-03 04:05:29] <jhaaxx> So after you are done with a burst, you use it so next one comes faster
[2023-01-03 04:05:33] <+Shawnzay> when ur arcane surge ends
[2023-01-03 04:05:38] <glife5501> only use that after arcane surge, radiant, and rune off power are on cooldown
[2023-01-03 04:05:41] <LurkLimit> Yeah right after all offensive cds are done
[2023-01-03 04:05:55] <jhaaxx> Use it when arcane surge buff ends, or when touch of the magi buff ends
[2023-01-03 04:06:17] <LurkLimit> Yup
[2023-01-03 04:06:18] <Chocodonut> yes
[2023-01-03 04:06:18] <%+Skab_> yep
[2023-01-03 04:06:20] <Xageos> yes
[2023-01-03 04:06:20] <jhaaxx> Yes
[2023-01-03 04:06:25] <+Shawnzay> yeah
[2023-01-03 04:06:25] <jhaaxx> Except on a raid settting
[2023-01-03 04:06:32] <LurkLimit> only clearcasting to conserve mana
[2023-01-03 04:06:38] <%KuruzuRei> so
[2023-01-03 04:06:41] <Chocodonut> only with clear casting

[2023-01-03 04:06:59] <jhaaxx> You need to have a certain amount of mana for the 2nd burst
[2023-01-03 04:07:00] <+jivan92> You stack a buff with it that makes your Arcane Barrage stonger
[2023-01-03 04:07:05] <%+Skab_> mana managament is a big part of Arcane
[2023-01-03 04:07:14] <%+Skab_> management*

[2023-01-03 04:08:13] <jhaaxx> But you want to use it when you are at 4 arcane charges, so it does more damage

[2023-01-03 04:08:45] <jhaaxx> The only reason you dont always stay at 4 charges is because you run out of mana

[2023-01-03 05:30:46] <+kai_xd09> the debuff goes away after the skeletons disappear, so some people cheese the first wall and just heal through the wall debuff

[2023-01-03 06:08:00] <%+LuCiell> at least for this dungeon i found imo
[2023-01-03 06:08:22] <%+LuCiell> the only mythic i dont use that marco i think is CoS and Jade
[2023-01-03 06:08:43] <%+LuCiell> unless my tank wants to pull the entire room
[2023-01-03 06:08:47] <%+Fugeki> Dungeons are pretty telegraphed imo specially higher keys so there should be some good windows to use them

[2023-01-03 11:04:23] <%BoredMarcus> I think many streamers have content brain, so if a game isn't amazing after 2 hours they fear boring their audience and they give up fast. It's understandable but it doesn't mean its a bad game
