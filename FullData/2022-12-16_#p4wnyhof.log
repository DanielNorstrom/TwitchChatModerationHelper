[2022-12-16 08:26:39] <dboTone> What do you think of the current state of Battlefield
[2022-12-16 08:27:05] <%LordOverflow> morning
[2022-12-16 08:27:26] <@%Primen93> so lets say you have a feature you wanna track. You have a couple of steps to do it in and that is when you use a jira board :D
[2022-12-16 08:27:29] <dboTone> You never got into bf4?
[2022-12-16 08:28:20] <@%Primen93> yeah work is eating me up basically :D I heared you tried the raid yesterday with a good friend of mine and yuki ?

[2022-12-16 08:30:31] <imaginecarinq> I hate the recoil to the left makes it impossible on controller lol
[2022-12-16 08:30:37] <@%Primen93> yeah i heared that as well. It is a pain in the arse when it crashes. They rly should fix that before the christmas holidays
[2022-12-16 08:30:52] <@%Primen93> otherwise they will loose a shit ton of players again
[2022-12-16 08:31:35] <%LordOverflow> Managed to max 2 weapons so far in MP Trial Moshpit. It's cool that they give us, who doesn't own MW2, chance to enjoy some of that multiplayer insanity

[2022-12-16 08:32:58] <@%Primen93> you going for th orion grind btw ?
[2022-12-16 08:33:03] <%LordOverflow> Ya maybe when price tag drops by 50%
[2022-12-16 08:33:18] <+An_drini> sup p4wny
[2022-12-16 08:33:19] <imaginecarinq> Waste of time lol
[2022-12-16 08:33:26] <@%Primen93> yeah sorry. I thought you might :D
[2022-12-16 08:33:26] <%+FrenchFryTy> Poly > Orion
[2022-12-16 08:33:31] <+An_drini> oh im doing that mf stupid grind cammo hahaha
[2022-12-16 08:33:56] <@%Primen93> I am currently doing it. Some guns are just not fun to play at all :D
[2022-12-16 08:33:57] <+An_drini> half the guns already have the gold one but longshots for platinum are the worst
[2022-12-16 08:33:59] <rodrigo_cann8i8> hi bro!!!
[2022-12-16 08:34:04] <+Rammy_101> platinum is enough for me. the rest is just insane imo
[2022-12-16 08:34:15] <+An_drini> yeah
[2022-12-16 08:34:22] <+An_drini> platinum is dope tho
[2022-12-16 08:34:25] <%dookyjustin> hello @p4wnyhof how are you I just filled out my info for twitch affiliate!!!!
[2022-12-16 08:34:30] <imaginecarinq> The gold looks worth going for but the others are not as good as Damascus was
[2022-12-16 08:34:52] <+An_drini> with the 4 new guns in this season i can skip rpg and the others rocket lunchers at least
[2022-12-16 08:35:06] <%dookyjustin> solid copy! thank you!
[2022-12-16 08:35:20] <@%Primen93> well guess who already went through the pain of the launchers LUL
[2022-12-16 08:35:22] <imaginecarinq> What’s the difference between affiliate and partner?
[2022-12-16 08:35:31] <+An_drini> @Primen93 oh god
[2022-12-16 08:35:40] <%D0lLars94> one thing that makes the camo grind easier tho is new guns count towards the number of plat/polyatomic guns u need to unlock furhter challenges. so now that there are 4 new weapons out already, u wouldnt need to do the launchers now
[2022-12-16 08:35:48] <+An_drini> today i have done knife and almost everything of the riot shield
[2022-12-16 08:36:11] <%+FrenchFryTy> doesn't partner get better stream quality or is that old news?
[2022-12-16 08:36:12] <%LordOverflow> As partner you're even more married and can't instantly sign off the contract
[2022-12-16 08:36:13] <@%Primen93> nope. I have to do the riot shield with the nerf now :D It will be a pain in the butthole :D
[2022-12-16 08:36:27] <+An_drini> @LordOverflow well
[2022-12-16 08:36:31] <%dookyjustin> so I can not multi stream as an affiliate?
[2022-12-16 08:36:39] <imaginecarinq> @primen93 I’ll pray for you haha
[2022-12-16 08:36:51] <+An_drini> @Primen93 it is painful
[2022-12-16 08:37:15] <%Grim08a> Good morning, Chimera i vastly OP in MP imo. Probably the fastet gun I unlocked gold on :D
[2022-12-16 08:37:19] <@%Primen93> well i will get there. Knife was quite ez and i might just wait for season 2 to drop the kali sticks :D
[2022-12-16 08:37:21] <%dookyjustin> NotLikeThis
[2022-12-16 08:37:30] <+Rammy_101> @Primen93 do it in tier 1. used to be 1 hit with shield though. dunno if its 2 now
[2022-12-16 08:37:58] <%+FrenchFryTy> played a game of solos earlier, got 5 kills, got the strong hold, bought a uav and instantly dev errored
[2022-12-16 08:37:59] <+An_drini> @Grim08a same here, too easy
[2022-12-16 08:38:00] <@%Primen93> Tier 1 is not Hardcore
[2022-12-16 08:38:05] <sharpsh007er> ttk is a joke joke

[2022-12-16 08:39:00] <@%Primen93> Yeah they already lost a big chunk of ppl with the decision of not putting in Hardcore
[2022-12-16 08:39:00] <%D0lLars94> yikes
[2022-12-16 08:39:01] <%+FrenchFryTy> low ttk is better for k&m players I feel
[2022-12-16 08:39:02] <sharpsh007er> :( oof
[2022-12-16 08:39:03] <+quote_> nope not how you win
[2022-12-16 08:39:06] <%Grim08a> @An_drini Yeah it helps, but still I tried some other guns and the Chimera fried

[2022-12-16 09:44:50] <%StanleyPotatoes> Sad
[2022-12-16 09:44:56] <imaginecarinq> Little dev team in South Korea could get you back in the game but not a billion dollar company Kappa
[2022-12-16 09:45:08] <%$krasssekaiuwe> @stanleypotatoes its not that bad....
[2022-12-16 09:45:13] <%+Atrionix> Oh have yet to unlock it

[2022-12-16 09:46:45] <%StanleyPotatoes> @krasssekaiuwe not that bad? This is a billion dollar game that I can’t play 3 rounds without someone on my team crashing.
[2022-12-16 09:46:57] <%+john_86> i lost the game last night, second place cause the game crashed, sry to say but such a trash game, really miss wz1, it had bugs but nothing compare with this
[2022-12-16 09:48:36] <%$krasssekaiuwe> @stanleypotatoes yea im with you bro dont get me wrong, but most of the time i have a lot of fun. Only few crashes
[2022-12-16 09:49:48] <%StanleyPotatoes> @krasssekaiuwe right but it’s been out a month now. Still the same issues. Went and gave fortnite no build another try and it’s honestly been so much fun.
[2022-12-16 09:49:55] <%thomasnost> 100% :D
[2022-12-16 09:50:01] <%Burkielol> its like revive in PUBG,not gonna happend LUL

[2022-12-16 09:50:55] <+TLS_Fish1> There would be ways to abuse reconnects to your advantage I think though.
[2022-12-16 09:51:11] <%Burkielol> 17 nukes,daaamn. dude was grinding LUL
[2022-12-16 09:51:14] <imaginecarinq> @atrionix Supreme Court here in the us blocked the purchase

[2022-12-16 09:51:26] <%+Atrionix> @imaginecarinq Oh I missed that, holy crap haha
[2022-12-16 09:51:46] <+TLS_Fish1> You’d just force exit when you find yourself in a fight you’re unable to win…then reconnect minutes later
[2022-12-16 09:51:56] <imaginecarinq> @atrionix it’s Sony being cry babies even tho Microsoft offered them everything exclusive look it up it’s pathetic lol
[2022-12-16 09:52:08] <%+Stevenbill> @tls_fish1 your character would be standing there and get killed
[2022-12-16 09:52:14] <%+Atrionix> I will look it up haha
[2022-12-16 09:52:36] <%+Atrionix> That camo of Russ sniper support tho!
[2022-12-16 09:52:38] <%+Stevenbill> But you’d be able to get bought back
[2022-12-16 09:52:54] <%+Atrionix> What is Russ his TAQ camo?
[2022-12-16 09:53:12] <+TLS_Fish1> Ohhh ok that’d be fine then if it can work like that. Thanks for clarifying
[2022-12-16 09:53:18] <%+john_86> can u move a bit the elgato add, so that we can see his face
[2022-12-16 09:53:37] <imaginecarinq> No it’s just yy
[2022-12-16 09:53:47] <%+john_86> thx

[2022-12-16 10:32:47] <Gankstrom> maybe in 2122
[2022-12-16 10:32:52] <kklstl> also reconnect feature in FPS BRs can be easily abused

[2022-12-16 10:33:20] <schwofler> cod doesn't need that feature, cause it never crashes anyway, right?

[2022-12-16 10:33:28] <%Mephist00> u just stand in your last place until reconnect
[2022-12-16 10:33:37] <KillerDog12> import time  def reconnect(max_attempts=5):     attempts = 0     while attempts < max_attempts:         try:             # attempt to connect to the resource             # (e.g., database, API, etc.)             connect()             return         except Exception:             attempts += 1             time.sleep(2)     raise Exception("Failed to connect after {} attempts".format(attempts))  reconnect()

[2022-12-16 10:34:18] <imaginecarinq> They we’ll eventually fix the crashes ppl we’ll forget
[2022-12-16 10:35:10] <E_o_W> there will always be crashes after patches etc so a reconnect funciton is a must imo
[2022-12-16 10:35:13] <%+grimuletz> @P4wnyhof restart TT stream? i am watching a random lady wtf :D
[2022-12-16 10:35:17] <kklstl> I could actually write an essay on how to abuse it but it depends on how the bot left behind would function. If you just stand there do nothing then there's "no" problem

[2022-12-16 11:07:56] <%t0pgun_> End of the year rush for me at work so not much time for gaming but holidays soon
[2022-12-16 11:08:07] <SpiralEve> its a week long playtest this time too instead of weekend, so plenty of time to try it

[2022-12-16 11:08:18] <%+Atrionix> @Mephist00 I played WoW for a bit earlier this year, it's A LOT and overwhelming when you're jumping in as a newbie. Is Dragonflight worth getting into as a newbie?
[2022-12-16 11:08:32] <SpiralEve> There is no solo queue, but there are some people who do play solo
[2022-12-16 11:08:47] <kmobtv> From Russ's community! Love the vibes brother.
[2022-12-16 11:09:11] <%Mephist00> @Mephist00 yes, very newbie friendly, they got rid of the overwhelming farming stuff, its a lookback to early WoW, its really nice
[2022-12-16 11:09:19] <SpiralEve> Its release for Q4 2023, but they have planned playtests monthly ... and yes its still early, but for me, same as old pubg, sometimes the bugs make the game more fun Kappa
[2022-12-16 11:09:30] <%Mephist00> @P4wnyhof have you checked the Crackpet Show? fun game, can play with viewers as well
[2022-12-16 11:09:34] <@%sateenvarjokauppias> @kmobtv Welcome! say hello to russ for me he might still remember who i am pownyL pownyHype

[2022-12-16 11:56:33] <+DSBlueT> I'll watch the video for the view too c:
[2022-12-16 11:56:45] <%+grimuletz> signal build is on   youtube on the muzzle vid as a bonus
[2022-12-16 11:56:47] <%+grimuletz> if i remember correctly
[2022-12-16 11:56:51] <%ITGuy_Gaming> What did Super People fail at again?

[2022-12-16 11:58:07] <%+grimuletz> @DSBlueT https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bc3S6Aowhlw in  case you don't wanna wait
[2022-12-16 11:58:21] <%ITGuy_Gaming> Why Super People 2? What happened to 1 :)
[2022-12-16 11:58:28] <%+grimuletz> apologies for having posted a link without asking,  was trying to help. i swear on me mum :D
[2022-12-16 11:58:36] <+DSBlueT> yeah I'm watching the video to give the view c:
[2022-12-16 11:59:14] <Skatmaker> I agree that there's cultural dissonance with Super People and the west.
[2022-12-16 11:59:15] <+Haydak> Sind die crashes wieder mehr geworden?
[2022-12-16 11:59:16] <+DSBlueT> ooo
[2022-12-16 11:59:25] <+DSBlueT> raptor sight possibly okay, got it
[2022-12-16 11:59:40] <%+Darave88> and the chimera build? Is that one on YT already?
[2022-12-16 12:00:37] <%+Darave88> ok ty
[2022-12-16 12:00:39] <+DSBlueT> chimera really good?
[2022-12-16 12:01:05] <Beaver_Brother> whats the AK build from game before?
[2022-12-16 12:01:25] <+Haydak> Between this patch and the patch before I had almost no crashes. Short after release it crashed almost every second DMZ or warzone match. MP was fine
[2022-12-16 12:02:09] <+DSBlueT> taq V over taq 56?
[2022-12-16 12:02:18] <+bbuuddy> You goin for more Hades?
[2022-12-16 12:02:26] <%tobiderfisch> I didn't crash at all yesterday so I was hoping they fixed it :(
[2022-12-16 12:02:28] <%+grimuletz> in an attempt to be funny: the crashes are your fault. if you die shortly after landing, you don't have time to crash. the longer you play,  the higher the chances of crashing. quick maths right here
[2022-12-16 12:02:44] <Skatmaker> I love it when the game says that it's loading the "message of the day" and then gives you a dev error. LUL

[2022-12-16 12:04:14] <%+Oni_Breezyy> The stream just crashed back to back for me... Its spreading!
[2022-12-16 12:04:16] <Darave88> gasmask was used already
[2022-12-16 12:04:22] <DSBlueT> gasmask empty

[2022-12-16 12:05:09] <+veanle7> hello everybody
[2022-12-16 12:05:22] <%+Oni_Breezyy> I didn't see the end, last I saw was ticks of gas damage in the house

[2022-12-16 12:07:18] <%+grimuletz> @P4wnyhof i  have a intricate question i would like  to  address, that has to do with "variety streaming". there might be points to  it that you  might not  want to expand on stream. should i ask here or head to discord (and if in disc, in what channel?)
[2022-12-16 12:07:20] <+Moraiel> Scene
[2022-12-16 12:08:19] <+Moraiel> Trap Damage increased?

[2022-12-16 12:08:25] <%GruntyFrown> stream title ..... Understood maybe Understand?... (sorry to be THAT guy)
[2022-12-16 12:09:41] <%+grimuletz> @GruntyFrown i read it in a  meme way, so  it didn't trigger my grammar ... policeman instinct. it's also common practice amongst streamers to intentionally add mistakes in the title or content of the video - it encourages interaction with it.

[2022-12-16 12:43:53] <+bluebreeze52> This seems like an Attack focused run.
[2022-12-16 12:45:49] <+bluebreeze52> If you do aspect of Achilles, that'd be more Special focused. But yeah, Attack is better on most spears.
[2022-12-16 12:46:46] <AntiViruzZz> damn, hades is so good made game
[2022-12-16 12:47:31] <shinydim> love the game

[2022-12-16 12:51:56] <Fluffz_86> any reason why you use the skelly trophy from the start? I always used something different and swapped if I needed it
[2022-12-16 12:51:59] <Fluffz_86> ah I thought it is the extra death defiance, my bad
[2022-12-16 12:52:55] <AntiViruzZz> true
[2022-12-16 12:53:04] <avraham3001> yo yo
[2022-12-16 12:53:13] <+antiheldbm> !
[2022-12-16 12:53:31] <%xjoev> beating it for fun now @P4wnyhof ?
[2022-12-16 12:53:46] <Fluffz_86> the fun starts at 20 heat
[2022-12-16 12:54:11] <%xjoev> nice
[2022-12-16 12:54:15] <AntiViruzZz> many many many times
[2022-12-16 12:54:22] <avraham3001> it's a progressive
[2022-12-16 12:54:30] <+xiBilly> what? just killing hades repeatedly wont get you the special ending though
[2022-12-16 12:54:46] <avraham3001> but it such a great game
[2022-12-16 12:54:47] <+dracofyre> I thought you had to increase the heat to get more story.
[2022-12-16 12:55:26] <+InfernalEagle93> you have to interact with the characters to progress the story, just beating Hades won't get you the special endings
[2022-12-16 12:55:35] <Fluffz_86> nah heat is just for your enjoyment, story progresses through dialogue mostly

[2022-12-16 12:56:16] <+djsopel> well u get the special rewards(meta currencies) per heat level per weapon
[2022-12-16 12:56:30] <+djsopel> from bosses
[2022-12-16 12:57:04] <%Darkxwizzard> what is that timer in the bottom left?
[2022-12-16 12:57:17] <Fluffz_86> its from the pact of punishment, he has 9 minutes per act
[2022-12-16 12:57:22] <+djsopel> so heat is separate for each weapon type
[2022-12-16 12:58:48] <shinydim> deleted xD
[2022-12-16 12:59:24] <%Darkxwizzard> that Artemis call did some dmg :O
[2022-12-16 13:00:50] <+danmbrx> Understood 😉🥰
[2022-12-16 13:00:50] <Fluffz_86> did p4wny encounter legendary boons yet?

[2022-12-16 13:10:12] <AntiViruzZz> this boss i hate the most xD
[2022-12-16 13:11:24] <Fluffz_86> from 15 s to about 4 minutes
[2022-12-16 13:12:47] <Fluffz_86> giga damage is hard with spear, but you are good in time so should be fine
[2022-12-16 13:14:15] <Herpi> good morning from Munich ... oh @P4wnyhof is playing Hades! cool! Hi chat
[2022-12-16 13:14:46] <Herpi> @P4wnyhof no dreamhack this year?
[2022-12-16 13:15:11] <Fluffz_86> but that is what you get with the crystal, you get slow consistent damage instead of bursting stuff
[2022-12-16 13:17:26] <+Searrar> do you already tried out some good duo boons?
[2022-12-16 13:18:02] <Herpi> dreamhack also looked very empty yesterday
[2022-12-16 13:18:36] <Fluffz_86> can you show your fated list for duo boons before next run
[2022-12-16 13:18:40] <Herpi> I´m also not there ... recognized 2 days ago this will happen ...
[2022-12-16 13:18:59] <Herpi> right! NO MARKETING ... have the same thoughts
[2022-12-16 13:19:14] <+Searrar> You should try out Merciful End duo boon. Curse of Agony on normal attack, deflect charge of athena.  This duo boons actives all charges of curse of agony immediatly. You just attack and dash through everything. Even the last Boss dies within seconds. its totally op :D
[2022-12-16 13:19:45] <Fluffz_86> good luck
[2022-12-16 13:20:02] <%ITGuy_Gaming> Is there only one try on Hades?
[2022-12-16 13:20:03] <%D3aDsH0TSS> you have 9 mins to beat him :D
[2022-12-16 13:20:16] <+Searrar> You can force them to appear.
[2022-12-16 13:20:28] <+Searrar> Or at least make it not very rare to get them
[2022-12-16 13:21:21] <Fluffz_86> I believe he is still in the discovering phase and not the force a build phase of the game
[2022-12-16 13:21:32] <%Darkxwizzard> is there even any Esport at Dreamhack?? haven't watched Dreamhacks in years, probably last time when GameSports was still around
[2022-12-16 13:21:51] <+Searrar> Start with fists, take the Ares relict           in stage 1 and get the attack, stage 2 you pick the athena relict. So you will get boons of both gods and therefore you can force the duo boon
[2022-12-16 13:21:59] <Fluffz_86> I know about an aoe2 tournament at least @Darkxwizzard
[2022-12-16 13:23:56] <Fluffz_86> smooth
[2022-12-16 13:23:56] <%Darkxwizzard> hmm okay never got the appeal of AoE Esport :D
