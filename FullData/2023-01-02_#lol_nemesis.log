[2023-01-02 20:32:15] <felanbot> and everyone (myself included) who reviewed the migration already had cmake stuff in there
[2023-01-02 20:32:31] <felanbot> literally all I did to review it was boot up the cmakefiles

[2023-01-02 21:01:10] <Felanbird> I'd just like to interject for a moment. What you're refering to as Linux, is in fact, GNU/Linux, or as I've recently taken to calling it, GNU plus Linux. Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX.
[2023-01-02 21:01:15] <Felanbird> Many computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is widely used today is often called Linux, and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project.

[2023-01-02 21:01:21] <!%j0sh1g4> Ok
[2023-01-02 21:01:21] <Felanbird> There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use. Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine's resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Linux is normally used in combination with the GNU operating system: the whole system is basically GNU with Linux added,
[2023-01-02 21:01:23] <Felanbird> or GNU/Linux. All the so-called Linux distributions are really distributions of GNU/Linux!

[2023-01-02 21:18:23] <!%j0sh1g4> it puts it in bin
[2023-01-02 21:18:31] <!%j0sh1g4> the bin in the build in the project
[2023-01-02 21:18:34] <Felanbird> that makes sense

[2023-01-02 21:22:28] <Felanbird> did u reorder it or did u add priority
[2023-01-02 21:23:00] <!%j0sh1g4> only reorder for now
[2023-01-02 21:23:26] <Felanbird> ah xd
[2023-01-02 21:23:39] <Felanbird> i was gonna say damn if u already added a priority system that shit was way easier than i thought
[2023-01-02 21:24:16] <!%j0sh1g4> it probably is
[2023-01-02 21:24:21] <!%j0sh1g4> just a hassle
[2023-01-02 21:24:35] <!%j0sh1g4> copy paste the user highlight 6 times
[2023-01-02 21:24:36] <!%j0sh1g4> rename
[2023-01-02 21:24:45] <!%j0sh1g4> and then change priority
[2023-01-02 21:24:53] <!%j0sh1g4> to anywhere in the chain
[2023-01-02 21:25:53] <Felanbird> i think the approach wanted would be giving each highlight type its own value backend and then a frontend option to change that value
[2023-01-02 21:26:28] <!%j0sh1g4> what if i want to have some user highlights be under phrase
[2023-01-02 21:26:34] <!%j0sh1g4> idk if anyone wants that tbh
[2023-01-02 21:26:45] <!%j0sh1g4> and some over
[2023-01-02 21:27:03] <!%j0sh1g4> but yea simple setting to set it for all would be good

[2023-01-02 21:27:08] <!%j0sh1g4> i could make that Copege
[2023-01-02 21:27:22] <!%j0sh1g4> do you perhaps know where the tab background color is

[2023-01-02 21:27:51] <!%j0sh1g4> the thing thats bothering me the most is that theres no tab in the top left
[2023-01-02 21:27:52] <Felanbird> probably in Theme.cpp
