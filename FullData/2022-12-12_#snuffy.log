[2022-12-12 00:23:12] <%inky_donut> I hate when people refer to orange juice as OJ. Why OJ? Do you want to sound cool? Is it so much of a hustle to say orange juice? Do you abbreviate apple juice too? " Hey yeah, let me have some AJ?" - said by no one ever. I just think it sound annoying af. Edit: I don't have any issues with abbreviations, except for OJ as orange juice. Sorry if I offended some of you with sensitive feelings.

[2022-12-12 01:56:59] <%$FriskyMoose> 2 makes punches slower, but jacks up the base damage

[2022-12-12 02:01:25] <%electric_pickle> they can, I think you have to buy a thing for it to happen though
[2022-12-12 02:01:26] <sweetbleek> theres an upgrade for that
[2022-12-12 02:01:29] <%MataNui95> Or it might be Dusa's keepsake

[2022-12-12 02:01:33] <TehNispe> Food with Dusa's keepsake. And you can buy an upgrade to find golden ones that give coins

[2022-12-12 02:15:41] <lunik1> in my experience I'm most inconsistent with the fists, but I've had some of my best runs with them
[2022-12-12 02:15:43] <Rindelle_Orenji> @Tylerjsmith97 spear is my personal favorite
[2022-12-12 02:15:45] <phiale> @tricolorhades i think its on the uppercut, it makes them really strong and you just mash triangle to win
[2022-12-12 02:15:58] <Tylerjsmith97> @Rindelle_Orenji i like the final sword
[2022-12-12 02:16:02] <Tylerjsmith97> its OP PepeLaugh

[2022-12-12 03:12:07] <%big_s0da> *Yooo
[2022-12-12 03:12:07] <%$Aeyrgran> heroic... is that super epic?
[2022-12-12 03:12:09] <phiale> BIG DEEPS
[2022-12-12 03:12:09] <Tylerjsmith97> slicing shot is good
[2022-12-12 03:12:15] <samwell_tarly> Impending Doom so you don't lose the aphro buff I think
[2022-12-12 03:12:16] <%tropicalshark> YESSIR moving up
[2022-12-12 03:12:20] <+smoked_rugs> snuffy
[2022-12-12 03:12:20] <%tommyp915> heroic might be too good to pass up Hmm
[2022-12-12 03:12:21] <Tylerjsmith97> very nice ESPECIALLY with the fists
[2022-12-12 03:12:21] <thunderb1tc> it melts
[2022-12-12 03:12:22] <demiiluna> Heroic is special, there are only 2 ways it can show up, one is as a replacement for an Epic boon.
[2022-12-12 03:12:23] <vexorialefttit> Slicing shot excellent
[2022-12-12 03:12:23] <%$PinkSupervisor> Angry ares is easier to handle compared to angry aphro imo

[2022-12-12 03:12:26] <dimitri_kraftman> worth
[2022-12-12 03:12:26] <Lackadais1cal> heroic on that cast is so good
[2022-12-12 03:12:30] <+DormantFlame> that reward list
[2022-12-12 03:12:31] <@%ZozzoTN> it means you havent ever picked it yet for that list
[2022-12-12 03:12:31] <+thanzo> means you haven't chosen it before
[2022-12-12 03:12:32] <phiale> the bandsaw is tricky to use but so much damage per frames
[2022-12-12 03:12:33] <%tommyp915> part of the fated list thing
[2022-12-12 03:12:34] <SilverFeng> fated choice means you never got it before
[2022-12-12 03:12:36] <%$Aeyrgran> scroll thing i think
[2022-12-12 03:12:37] <%longlooongmaan> Geeeet iiittt
[2022-12-12 03:12:40] <!%Jekodd> that means you havent taken it yet so it will work towards a goal in the book
[2022-12-12 03:12:42] <Squirrelofudun> Heroic is really good, but almost only shows up from replacing boons
[2022-12-12 03:12:42] <samwell_tarly> Fated choice (i.e. the scrolls near hte names) means you haven't taken that boon before
[2022-12-12 03:12:43] <ettieneludor> Heroic cast is fantastic
[2022-12-12 03:12:43] <%$Aeyrgran> the Prophussies
[2022-12-12 03:12:43] <sleepy_moohnie> heroic is only available from trades or rarity upgrades so thats pog
[2022-12-12 03:12:43] <%big_s0da> 2 might be better
[2022-12-12 03:12:44] <ZombieTeriyaki> means you have not picked it before
[2022-12-12 03:12:46] <%tommyp915> its all the ones you havent chosen
[2022-12-12 03:12:47] <Tylerjsmith97> @snuffy the fated choices are ones you havent gotten yet. each time you pick one it checks one off on the scroll in your room
[2022-12-12 03:12:48] <Keninje> fated choice means you didn't get it yet for the reward
[2022-12-12 03:12:48] <+ollieaul> I never liked slicing hsot
[2022-12-12 03:12:49] <%longlooongmaan> 1
[2022-12-12 03:12:50] <%AxillaryPower> Fated Choice means it's on the prophecy list
[2022-12-12 03:12:50] <+ollieaul> shot
[2022-12-12 03:12:52] <+ollieaul> idk why
[2022-12-12 03:12:52] <emanonami> top
[2022-12-12 03:12:52] <sleepy_moohnie> i dont really like slicing shot though
[2022-12-12 03:12:54] <%Brumaterra> Fated choice means you didn't chose it yet, you get rewards once you choose everything once
[2022-12-12 03:12:56] <Zelekin> slicing shot!
[2022-12-12 03:12:57] <vexorialefttit> Impending doom or Slicing Shot
[2022-12-12 03:12:57] <dimitri_kraftman> you get something better
[2022-12-12 03:12:58] <Zelekin> is real good
[2022-12-12 03:13:01] <+DormantFlame> 2 if you don't want to trade
[2022-12-12 03:13:02] <%big_s0da> If you want to keep the shot pick 2
[2022-12-12 03:13:02] <%tommyp915> eh you could stand to lose crush shot
[2022-12-12 03:13:03] <@%ZozzoTN> 1 or 2 are decent picks either way
[2022-12-12 03:13:04] <+trzonji> 1
[2022-12-12 03:13:04] <zetsubouman> crush shot seemed really good
[2022-12-12 03:13:04] <sleepy_moohnie> if you like your current cast just take 3
[2022-12-12 03:13:05] <thunderb1tc> its that good
[2022-12-12 03:13:05] <tomu_pleochroic> it does repeating damage and moves slowly
[2022-12-12 03:13:06] <+two_capybaras> tough choice
[2022-12-12 03:13:10] <%tommyp915> crush shot kinda sucks
[2022-12-12 03:13:10] <ripass> the greatest gifts requires an equal trade
[2022-12-12 03:13:11] <Theft_Jord> slicing shot is busted\

[2022-12-12 03:13:15] <vexorialefttit> Take 2 if you don't want it
[2022-12-12 03:13:15] <Qexec> 2 is also fine
[2022-12-12 03:13:21] <+NekoNura> Its rare, so worth getting to try it
[2022-12-12 03:13:22] <%Bradwarden27> Try it out
[2022-12-12 03:13:22] <+SpecOperative> Slicing shot is alright
[2022-12-12 03:13:22] <TehNispe> It's not
[2022-12-12 03:13:22] <sleepy_moohnie> heroic is just the rarity
[2022-12-12 03:13:24] <@%ZozzoTN> its really good vs bone hydra
[2022-12-12 03:13:24] <%Xiazee> "rapidly" deals damage
[2022-12-12 03:13:26] <+DormantFlame> the one you have does a blast that causes weakness in a small area
[2022-12-12 03:13:27] <+two_capybaras> i never really liked slicing shot
[2022-12-12 03:13:28] <SkyeManaWielder> Itll scale better, i think, if you upgrade it with poms.
[2022-12-12 03:13:29] <%+saint_yotsuba> 1 is good, 2 is a good alternate
[2022-12-12 03:13:30] <phiale> slicing shot goes well with some mixes but also its a bit unorthodox
[2022-12-12 03:13:31] <%longlooongmaan> 1111111111
[2022-12-12 03:13:36] <readreadchopper> honestly all the boons kinda stink'
[2022-12-12 03:13:42] <%tropicalshark> depends what your going for monkaHmm
[2022-12-12 03:13:42] <Y2Ken> they always upgrade rarity if it's swapping out, so don't worry too much about that
[2022-12-12 03:13:46] <thunderb1tc> itll carry trust
[2022-12-12 03:13:51] <Cleofield> Heroic is a step higher than Epic
[2022-12-12 03:13:52] <zetsubouman> Hmm
[2022-12-12 03:13:54] <%tropicalshark> the beyblade cast is kinda cool
[2022-12-12 03:13:55] <+Crushermach3> 1
[2022-12-12 03:13:59] <Tylerjsmith97> @snuffy IMO crush shot is good when it gets upgraded but early on slicing shot is good

[2022-12-12 04:13:01] <blastyoboots> Cheer100 There's a secret trick with the spear the game NEVER tells you if you want to test it against skelly.  If you charge up the spear's spin attack, but you DASH instead of letting go of the button, you'll do a HUGE sweep forward instead of spinning in place, it's a much better move.
