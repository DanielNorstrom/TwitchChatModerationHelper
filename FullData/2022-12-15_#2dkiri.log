[2022-12-15 17:01:10] <SlitheringPanda> It took me watching a YT tutorial to find out all my plump helmet seeds were getting destroyed in kitchens LUL

[2022-12-15 17:03:59] <SlitheringPanda> @SlitheringPanda So if your kitchens cook plump helmets you dont get seeds, but turning them in to booze does give seeds! you have to go to Labor>Kitchens and disable cooking for them
[2022-12-15 17:05:00] <Trongan> @SlitheringPanda pretty much every refining of the plants also produces seeds. so if you mill them first, you get a seed and can use the flour in the kitchen

[2022-12-15 17:05:28] <SlitheringPanda> @Trongan Ohhhh pog, ive been meaning to dabble with milling/extracting from plants etc. Thats good to know!

[2022-12-15 17:09:33] <Trongan> I played for years before figuring out how to break through an aquifier. there is always something to procastrinate on ^^
[2022-12-15 17:09:41] <+byteplatoon> No backpacks
[2022-12-15 17:09:58] <dev_spajus> I get lost with z levels a bit
[2022-12-15 17:10:07] <nozibob> @Trongan how do you do that? pump out water while smoothing walls?
[2022-12-15 17:10:09] <shunoshi> Do you have a refuse stockpile so at least they'll dump the rotten food?
[2022-12-15 17:10:13] <%+The_Dakta> you just have to build one at a workshop first
[2022-12-15 17:10:16] <SlitheringPanda> Just table and mechanisms i think
[2022-12-15 17:10:28] <Kynikos197> military dwarves keep food in backpacks so if they dont all have one maybe thats why they drop?
[2022-12-15 17:10:51] <dev_spajus> oh, nice!
[2022-12-15 17:11:04] <Trongan> @nozibob depends. if it is a light one, it is just mining and placing walls. but the heavy ones require some pumping. once you have done it once sucessfully it is super easy. but understanding it can take a bit
[2022-12-15 17:11:06] VIEWERS: 435
[2022-12-15 17:11:28] <+byteplatoon> Then too many backpacks
[2022-12-15 17:11:38] <nozibob> @Trongan Gotcha, thx! I decided to challenge myself with a light aquifer start and ended up mining around it to get stone.
[2022-12-15 17:11:47] <Trongan> @nozibob the wall smoothing works, if it is a stone layer. if it is a dirt layer, you have to wall it off
[2022-12-15 17:12:00] <nozibob> It's all clay lol
[2022-12-15 17:12:19] <!%Dome007> What did I miss? kiriLove kiriHug
[2022-12-15 17:12:37] <Trongan> the light aquifier usually has so little pressure, that you can mine it out and place the walls no problem. you just have to do it as soon as you see it

[2022-12-15 17:29:56] <wishcraft4u2> @2DKiri if you have so called "flux stones" rather than trying to get better iron armor, maybe try to go for steel armor and weapons
[2022-12-15 17:30:04] <Wavehopper> were zebras, were beavers, were mouse... this game hates me

[2022-12-15 17:30:23] <lirael22> @The_Dakta yeah ore the possibility to order the orders after workshops
[2022-12-15 17:30:23] <wishcraft4u2> flux stones are calcium containing stones like chalk, limestone,
[2022-12-15 17:30:30] <wishcraft4u2> marble,
[2022-12-15 17:30:34] <%rselbo> looks like i chat about 3-4 times per stream according to the stats, so this will be my last message today kiriLOL

[2022-12-15 17:30:47] <PsychoI3oy> they're not called "flux" but there's several stones that will let you make flux for steel
[2022-12-15 17:31:22] <lirael22> you have flux stones. with that your able to make first pig iron, and then steel
[2022-12-15 17:31:26] <@%2DKiriBot> Remember to clip funny moments. They go into clip compilations for YT kiriCool
[2022-12-15 17:31:35] <janton527> the DF wiki is really good for seeing the different Flux stones and iron/metal ores

[2022-12-15 17:32:01] <slackerunchained> Lead makes for terrible armor, i'm afraid, due to its softness.... A human can literally tear apart a metal breastplate with their bare-hands. :\
[2022-12-15 17:32:17] <+greentater> lead is only used to make drinking mugs and sippie cups for baby dwarfs
[2022-12-15 17:32:19] <slackerunchained> It DOES make for decent blunt-weaponry, though
[2022-12-15 17:32:26] <%Possenreisser> gotta go run errands and stuff, have a good one Kiri and chat kiriWave

[2022-12-15 17:32:45] <%BurrowsForge> So that was the thing about making economic stone blocks. I'm not sure if it will use your flux stones up when you should save some for forging
[2022-12-15 17:33:00] <%+Death_Pony> @BurrowsForge it sure will
[2022-12-15 17:33:08] <%DnDMonty> surprise?! what surprise? What are you up too Kiri?
[2022-12-15 17:33:08] <%+ShoeEventHorizon> The surprise is Kiri's is becoming a Fortnite streamer :-)
[2022-12-15 17:33:26] <@%2DKiriBot> We're making a snowflake garland this Holiday season. Sub, gift at least 1 sub, cheer at least 500 Bits, or tip at least €5 to get your snowflake in the garland kiriSee
[2022-12-15 17:33:35] <Trongan> my last few forts didn't even have a source of iron, so I had to improvise with whatever I could find. dwarves are pretty sturdy. it doesn't always have to be the best material
[2022-12-15 17:33:36] <wishcraft4u2> @2DKiri spears are the best default weapon imho, since they are surprisingly lethal (puncturing organs) and rather easy for dwarves to wield
[2022-12-15 17:33:50] VIEWERS: 466
[2022-12-15 17:34:22] <wishcraft4u2> @2DKiri some enemies like some undead dont care if you put them full of holes tho, so maces are also recommended... make them out of heavy metals like lead or silver, impact is what makes a mace good
[2022-12-15 17:34:47] <%DnDMonty> @shoeeventhorizon God no!
[2022-12-15 17:35:00] <Trongan> I usually go for a mix of different weapons. mostly for flavor. but there might be enemies that are weak to different types
[2022-12-15 17:35:18] <$pieceoftheuniverse> Traction benches require mechanisms and chains. I always forget to make enough chains
[2022-12-15 17:35:26] <wishcraft4u2> but yeah, a mix of weapons (per squad) is usually good idea
[2022-12-15 17:35:48] <%DnDMonty> the dnd stuff is in English? kiriBless

[2022-12-15 17:36:11] <lirael22> @wishcraft4u2 really? a long time most weapons wrer really unbalanced, I don´t know if they fixed that really
[2022-12-15 17:36:23] <%BurrowsForge> that happened to me too. You can set a stockpile for the rocks you want next to the workshop and then connect that workshop.  I make a separate stockpile next to my smelter with the flux stones in it.
[2022-12-15 17:36:36] <%RonanSoleste> I’d love to see that Sunday morning. But it’s likely to be my only day I can ice skate so… priorities
[2022-12-15 17:37:11] <Trongan> I think rope should work too
[2022-12-15 17:37:19] <3rdlevelwizard> Ropes work instead of chains too.
[2022-12-15 17:37:20] <%Gruuberino> traction benches also require a table
[2022-12-15 17:37:24] <+SamuraiBebop07> Can I ask, is there a good tip to get your dwarves to drink from a well, or will they do that on their own if they have enough barrels?
[2022-12-15 17:37:31] <%BoooFN> is this fortress more of a Moria, or an Erebor? catonBox
[2022-12-15 17:37:46] <%BoooFN> i mean, are we going to die to balrogs or dragons? catonBox

[2022-12-15 17:38:21] <SlitheringPanda> I /think/ 90% of metal objects are made at the Metalsmith, even if its furniture etc
[2022-12-15 17:38:37] <Trongan> @SamuraiBebop07 usually they will go for the alcohol. but if they need to give water to another dwarf that can't move they pick up a bucket and get water from the well or whatever watersource is around barring that.
[2022-12-15 17:38:50] <wishcraft4u2> is it still the case that dwarves that are injured will want to drink water?
[2022-12-15 17:38:51] <Just_a_Chimp> @SamuraiBebop07 set it as a water source (3x3) around the well
[2022-12-15 17:38:52] <lirael22> @SamuraiBebop07 they only drink water if they have to bc of lack of alcohol. and it makes them veery upset
[2022-12-15 17:38:54] <%BurrowsForge> You need a well, bucket and a rope I think. Then they will drink from it on their own if the well is above water
[2022-12-15 17:38:56] <%BoooFN> yet cirNom
[2022-12-15 17:38:58] <+SamuraiBebop07> Ok, thank you. :)
[2022-12-15 17:39:01] <Trongan> yeah, they only drink water, if there is no better option
[2022-12-15 17:39:18] <%DnDMonty> I want to fight a balroc
[2022-12-15 17:39:24] <%BurrowsForge> I don that too @lirael22
[2022-12-15 17:39:25] <wishcraft4u2> ah yeah, right. you need water for hospitals anyways. Soap too!
[2022-12-15 17:39:30] <%DnDMonty> kiriLOL
[2022-12-15 17:39:30] <%BurrowsForge> do*
[2022-12-15 17:39:31] <+pimplordmofo> Just like irl
[2022-12-15 17:39:49] <Trongan> dwarves who are so injured that they need to be fed have to drink water. that's one use for buckets
[2022-12-15 17:39:51] VIEWERS: 481
[2022-12-15 17:40:09] <Trongan> like if they can't move to the booze pile
[2022-12-15 17:40:17] <Just_a_Chimp> if you leave it unassigned everyone will use it
[2022-12-15 17:40:17] <%+The_Dakta> you shouldn't need to assign anyone
[2022-12-15 17:40:19] <SlitheringPanda> Its only 1 assignment, that dorf is just married
[2022-12-15 17:40:33] <lirael22> dinings halls don´t need to be assignt
[2022-12-15 17:40:53] <%OnixAlastair> @SlitheringPanda :D
[2022-12-15 17:40:53] <lirael22> the food is in another room
[2022-12-15 17:40:55] <Just_a_Chimp> the tables down by the food are closer
[2022-12-15 17:40:56] <+DeimosMechanicus> assigning makes hall specific for that dwarf
[2022-12-15 17:40:57] <lirael22> and the drinks
[2022-12-15 17:40:58] <+crazyhobbitman> You only need to assign dining halls to satisfy noble type dwarves.
[2022-12-15 17:41:33] <lirael22> they want food and drinks in theire dining hall. I think they just eat and drink in the tavern otherwise
[2022-12-15 17:41:37] <Trongan> there is room in the tavern, so maybe they don't see the need to run further
[2022-12-15 17:41:43] <Just_a_Chimp> some dwarves are literally just slobs
[2022-12-15 17:41:47] <st_yfrit> is it like guild hall and you need a value of 2000 for it to be a "true" dining hall?
[2022-12-15 17:41:49] <Just_a_Chimp> like as a personality
[2022-12-15 17:41:51] VIEWERS: 493

[2022-12-15 17:49:48] <Trongan> playing this game is a little bit like learning programming

[2022-12-15 18:00:18] <%+banana_cabana> missed bolts get forbidden so that people don't run out in the middle of danger to get them, you have to unforbid them after it's safe
[2022-12-15 18:00:36] <+crazyhobbitman> There is a setting under the tabs on the left that can allow bolts to be picked up.
[2022-12-15 18:00:39] <%Gruuberino> I think that is so that when there is a siege, your dwarfs fire bolts out at the attackers and dont automatically go outside to get their bolts back LUL
[2022-12-15 18:00:42] <Just_a_Chimp> yes, go to standing orders in labor menu, its under sieges and forbidding

[2022-12-15 18:15:17] <slackerunchained> @Ventoron Basically, Elven-files in the code allow them to 'Grow' living-wood into certain shapes as a racial abaility, which presumably doesn't kill the tree.
