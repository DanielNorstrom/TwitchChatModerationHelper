[2022-12-16 01:33:04] <%theNataliePaige> Hi Leo!
[2022-12-16 01:33:12] <@%AeroRG> what on earth is a bolero? lol
[2022-12-16 01:33:16] <%MichouxGifts> @nanceoir cerian1Blush
[2022-12-16 01:33:26] <%ryanleafmusic> @AeroRG Bolero is a Spanish dance in 3/4 time popular in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. It originated from the seguidilla sometime between 1750 and 1772,[2] and it became very popular in Madrid, La Mancha, Andalusia and Murcia in the 1780s.[3][4] Bolero was performed as a solo or partner dance with a moderately slow tempo, accompanied by guitar and castanets, and with lyrics in the form of the seguidilla.
