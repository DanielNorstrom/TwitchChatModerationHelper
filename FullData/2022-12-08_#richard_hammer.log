[2022-12-08 03:25:20] <+thurman86> not knowing anything about this game is how i had the most amazing experiences

[2022-12-08 03:27:39] <%Katsundere> this game's first version was made in 2002
[2022-12-08 03:27:44] <%Katsundere> it's also literally in the museum of modern art
[2022-12-08 03:28:36] <ReformingOne> I know literally nothing about this game I'm kind of trying to learn watching you learn was why I asked
[2022-12-08 03:29:06] <%Katsundere> this was the inspiration for rimworld and other games of the genre
[2022-12-08 03:29:26] <ReformingOne> This games influence on Rimworld is pretty apparent
[2022-12-08 03:29:32] <%+Mhoram_> It's Dorfin Time

[2022-12-08 05:10:44] <DemonedAway> Fiction is about iteration. Game dev especially. Nobody is out here making completely unique games, its next to impossible. But what we can do is improve on things we have.
[2022-12-08 05:11:02] <$Negarretep> Lol, look at this nerd playing a pong clone
[2022-12-08 05:11:25] <ItsSplendid> everything is a doom clone Kappa
[2022-12-08 05:11:32] <BrokenGemLord> not that games need to be original.. if the game is good its good
[2022-12-08 05:11:32] <@^Moobot> Buy things on Amazon and support your favorite Dick! n3f.tv/rhamazon
[2022-12-08 05:11:33] <VXIDastronaut> imagne pong with layers
[2022-12-08 05:11:45] <craven_the_tank> Whats the best clone youve seen then richard?
[2022-12-08 05:11:47] <%$PrismaticDuck> Everything clones reality, SMH
[2022-12-08 05:11:52] <DemonedAway> I just disagree with the idea of a clone in general. I know you don't use the word badly, of course.
[2022-12-08 05:12:00] <%+Savageblackduck> i like all TDs, please keep cloning more
[2022-12-08 05:12:03] <Line_Noise> I'd love to see a modernised Multi User Dungeon
[2022-12-08 05:12:21] <VXIDastronaut> people still make doom WADs
[2022-12-08 05:12:25] <Tpocket> Oh man i spent a lot of time in MUDs as a kid
[2022-12-08 05:12:55] <Tpocket> its inherently reductive
[2022-12-08 05:12:57] <Skrichur> is there combat in Dwarf Fortress or is it more calm, colony building/living
[2022-12-08 05:13:03] <$Negarretep> @Skrichur there is combat
[2022-12-08 05:13:13] <Skrichur> but who would want to hurt dwarves
[2022-12-08 05:13:26] <%Erbrand> a stray capybara
[2022-12-08 05:13:30] <VXIDastronaut> pokemon , but with guns
[2022-12-08 05:13:31] <%$PrismaticDuck> Everything in this game wants to kill you
[2022-12-08 05:13:33] <$Negarretep> Well, just earlier today it was his dwarves that wanted to hurt other dwarves
[2022-12-08 05:13:34] <%$PrismaticDuck> EVERYTHING
[2022-12-08 05:13:36] <craven_the_tank> Id also say my favorite book series in the world is defiantly a clone I love the eragon series but its starwars for example
[2022-12-08 05:13:37] <DemonedAway> Yes, that's what I was getting at. We've been developing all sorts of games and fictions for hundreds of years. There are still new ideas, but what people can do much better right now is improve the ones we already have.
[2022-12-08 05:13:42] <+briantank11> !please
[2022-12-08 05:13:42] <@^Moobot> @briantank11 Please don't spoil anything. Richard is a whiner and wants to work it out for himself. Just sit back and enjoy the Dick Hammer show.
[2022-12-08 05:13:43] <Skrichur> even the dwarves fight each other! omg
[2022-12-08 05:13:44] <@%+JimmyNintendo> You can do it
[2022-12-08 05:13:46] <DemonedAway> Which results in "clones"
[2022-12-08 05:13:50] <Tpocket> Cavy's are like... ginuea pigs?
[2022-12-08 05:14:32] <+HoneyMacs> Clap
[2022-12-08 05:14:34] <%+Mhoram_> Big Learnin
[2022-12-08 05:14:36] <craven_the_tank> he's a learner
[2022-12-08 05:14:40] <PlaceboSaggins> so proud
[2022-12-08 05:14:44] <Tpocket> you don't like the chruch pen?
[2022-12-08 05:14:57] <ItsSplendid> that would be to easy LUL
[2022-12-08 05:15:07] <@%+JimmyNintendo> Look it's on the to-do list
[2022-12-08 05:15:09] <@%+JimmyNintendo> THey'll get to it
[2022-12-08 05:15:16] <%hottiefruits> but then we wouldn't have gotten that rant from you
[2022-12-08 05:15:20] <Line_Noise> We've got pixels. Baby steps
[2022-12-08 05:15:23] <+CreteTTV> was i trippin' or were u streaming at like 10a today?
[2022-12-08 05:15:34] <Tpocket> mods please save this game's UI
[2022-12-08 05:15:46] <craven_the_tank> This games been a to-do list for what 20 years now? and every time i come back to watching it its in a better place
[2022-12-08 05:16:10] <%Erbrand> please don't fuck the animals
[2022-12-08 05:16:30] <%+Mhoram_> 2006
[2022-12-08 05:16:44] <%+Savageblackduck> that feel when wow came out before that
[2022-12-08 05:16:47] <+CreteTTV> it fits in this case
[2022-12-08 05:16:55] <Line_Noise> It seems like the fanbase don't hate this version and there's an amazing achievement for a launch
[2022-12-08 05:16:58] <+HoneyMacs> also its been free forever up til now
[2022-12-08 05:17:01] <DemonedAway> At some point you should just put it in 1.0 and then keep working on it
[2022-12-08 05:17:04] <craven_the_tank> Dwarf fortress did it right for early access no greed just a love for progress and making it better
[2022-12-08 05:17:06] <+CreteTTV> if ANY game belongs in endless early access it's this one
[2022-12-08 05:17:08] <phillymilksteak> Im about to try to make an in-base water cistern for a well but I dont know how water behaves exactly so I probably am about to flood my base
[2022-12-08 05:17:14] <@%+JimmyNintendo> They're loving it today
[2022-12-08 05:17:22] <@%+JimmyNintendo> They met their 2 months sales goal in 24 hours
[2022-12-08 05:17:27] <trashpandab3ar> Those videos are great. He's so passionate in those videos
[2022-12-08 05:17:28] <$Attckcat> @DemonedAway Exactly, you have a 1.0 featureset, and then just keep updating as you want, hasnt stopped terraria LUL
[2022-12-08 05:17:47] <craven_the_tank> @JimmyNintendo wait like the company got all 2 months of sales today?
[2022-12-08 05:17:51] [Notification] SgtARock subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 71 months!
[2022-12-08 05:18:40] <JohnDoeRadio> was a modest expectation, im sure they saw the wishlist numbers
[2022-12-08 05:18:44] <%hottiefruits> the tavern full of dead cats video is amazing
[2022-12-08 05:18:48] <+CreteTTV> there was a documentary on Ultima Online, and the crazy coding problems they had being the first online game... its really good
[2022-12-08 05:18:55] <Line_Noise> They were expecting only 160k sales and smashed that
[2022-12-08 05:19:08] <Line_Noise> It's up near the top of the top grossing Steam charts I think
[2022-12-08 05:19:18] <$Attckcat> Its like one of those teachers everyone hates who refuses to give an A because "no ones perfect"
[2022-12-08 05:19:25] <craven_the_tank> Like the avatar movie needing to break the world record to break even? KEKW
[2022-12-08 05:19:26] <Tpocket> I would check in every couple of months, I always thought the UI was gonna be cracked open by a modding team, boy was I surprised when they announced the steam version
[2022-12-08 05:20:16] <%+Savageblackduck> i cant tell if this is more annoying or less annoying than rimworld
[2022-12-08 05:20:33] <+CreteTTV> @Savageblackduck yes
[2022-12-08 05:21:00] <$Attckcat> @Savageblackduck It definitely has more planes to be annoyed on LUL
[2022-12-08 05:21:02] <craven_the_tank> Well Richard it doesnt help when the entire movie is CGI to the max and needed a new rendering system to just function
[2022-12-08 05:21:02] <%+Savageblackduck> the music is def better
[2022-12-08 05:21:40] <%+Savageblackduck> the reduction of sliders and tabs seems like a less annoying data point
[2022-12-08 05:21:41] <@^Moobot> Excited to be able to share an awesome discount with you guys on GREAT coffee! If you are interested make sure you check out https://madrinascoffee.com/?ref=mDeO9viBk1JJ7z & use code "Hammer" to save !
[2022-12-08 05:21:42] <Tpocket> I think its fair to say this game is more annoying than rimworld, but for the people who dig it its reawarding
[2022-12-08 05:21:56] <+skagator> @Tpocket Dig Deeper
[2022-12-08 05:22:45] <%+Savageblackduck> i just find rimworld "annoyingly" complicated and not comfy
[2022-12-08 05:22:48] <Fraeyalise> so glad you're streaming, I needed this distraction.
[2022-12-08 05:22:51] <craven_the_tank> But will someone burn down my whole base because they didnt get to eat at a table in dwarf fort?
[2022-12-08 05:23:02] <%$eSaltcracker> rimworld is less of a hassle to play
[2022-12-08 05:23:04] <+CreteTTV> Yea, no one really noticed when Daggerfall had Left shoulderpad, Right shoulderpad... left upper arm, right upper-arm... and Elder scrolls just made it all one "Gloves
[2022-12-08 05:23:38] <JohnDoeRadio> nah but a giat badger colony moves into your mountain and kills everyone inside
[2022-12-08 05:23:38] <Fraeyalise> @cretettv Morrowind had that as well, I think it changed in oblivion
[2022-12-08 05:23:41] <bubble_d> I always recommend stellaris for Civ building games. So many hours in that game
[2022-12-08 05:23:42] <JohnDoeRadio> giant
[2022-12-08 05:23:54] <craven_the_tank> It only happened once... lol pyro didnt get to eat at a table while i was making bacon in the kitchen and my whole base burned down while i was afk
[2022-12-08 05:24:17] <%+Savageblackduck> yeah but you get to piss of your friend DM while you do it
[2022-12-08 05:24:26] <Tpocket> lol the term tantrum spiral came from dwarf fortress :P
[2022-12-08 05:24:34] <Tpocket> or the dwarf fortress community
[2022-12-08 05:24:41] <+CreteTTV> lol, our DM once said "You hear a voice on the wind say: 'Theres nothing else in this fkn room, move on'
[2022-12-08 05:24:44] <%hottiefruits> and then you can try to piss off the DM by setting said inn on fire
[2022-12-08 05:24:59] <Anongamer> It takes time to get into, and honestly the stream release makes it a lot more approachable for most people
[2022-12-08 05:25:13] <+sventyard> I've been playing DF in my steam deck and it runs great.
[2022-12-08 05:25:17] <$Attckcat> How many dwarves have you lost because you didnt have a turtle shell chat? rooKek
[2022-12-08 05:25:19] <Fraeyalise> it's certainly much more fun to watch now!
[2022-12-08 05:25:27] <Tpocket> you try to leave the room and the door is locked
[2022-12-08 05:25:37] <craven_the_tank> The worst a player has done to me is used an in as a bomb with fireball because the hard booze went kaboom
[2022-12-08 05:26:06] <+skagator> Each dwarf gets a bedroom and a dressing room?
[2022-12-08 05:26:35] <Fraeyalise> omg that's amazing
[2022-12-08 05:26:42] <+skagator> haha
[2022-12-08 05:26:43] <AnzheIika> beautiful
[2022-12-08 05:26:50] <bubble_d> that's mortifying

[2022-12-08 05:26:52] <Tpocket> thats ART
[2022-12-08 05:26:53] <ItsSplendid> This is somewhat macabre LUL
[2022-12-08 05:26:54] <%+Savageblackduck> DM lets you have a pot of infinite rice you got in a previous mission, proceed to use rice as a defensible position, DM no longer allows pots of infinite rice

[2022-12-08 05:31:30] <%Erbrand> so like installing stuff will have them craft more?

[2022-12-08 05:36:17] <%Erbrand> is that not true?

[2022-12-08 05:47:35] <craven_the_tank> ty for the response.. so we use dwarven escalators to rapidly ascend the mountain... hmmm
[2022-12-08 05:47:40] <%hottiefruits> so we're aiming for atrip to the circus here?

[2022-12-08 05:49:58] <craven_the_tank> So do we have random events the way rimworld does? or does the world just naturally try to fuck you over?

[2022-12-08 05:55:35] <MarineCorpsRemoteViewing> why do you stack your rooms like that? (bedroom > study > tomb)

[2022-12-08 05:58:04] <$Thruxed> would you go to a fortress where a guy got attacked by sand?
[2022-12-08 05:58:10] <KamDango> do dwarven children have beards 🤔

[2022-12-08 06:41:53] <+punchingKirby> the doors
[2022-12-08 06:41:59] <%Erbrand> the doors are not the same
[2022-12-08 06:42:04] <DenizLS> Should bedrooms over lap the walls/doors?
[2022-12-08 06:42:04] <+Riverdusk> doors are off center, then centered
[2022-12-08 06:42:09] <%Erbrand> the first beds have them on the right
[2022-12-08 06:42:27] <%Erbrand> whew!
[2022-12-08 06:43:23] <%ANeerMiss> So they need a bedroom, a dining room and....the knowledge that when they die they already have a coffin
[2022-12-08 06:43:35] <+Riverdusk> no angry dwarves yet anyway
[2022-12-08 06:43:42] <+MitchConnors> My brain is too smooth for Rimworld so is Dwarf Fortress going to destroy me?
[2022-12-08 06:43:55] <JohnDoeRadio> yes
[2022-12-08 06:43:56] <NefariousBeans> yes
[2022-12-08 06:43:58] <Revilrier> is that a tomb for every dwarf

[2022-12-08 06:45:38] <Geo_Niam> I think DF is more exploitable if you understand the systems, but learning is way, way steeper and more unforgiving than rimworld

[2022-12-08 06:46:12] <%Erbrand> encrust ammo with cut gems
[2022-12-08 06:46:14] <Smewkie> A big difference between DF and Rimworld is that you can make a base that no enemy can possibly breach in Dorf Fort.
[2022-12-08 06:46:14] <%Erbrand> hell yeah
[2022-12-08 06:46:54] <Smewkie> And you can make unbreakable traps that kill any enemy as well in Dorf Fort, so in a lot of ways combat is way easier
[2022-12-08 06:49:54] <$Negarretep> I see Dick is a fan of open floor plans
[2022-12-08 06:50:27] <ThaChillera> has dick found an ore vein yet?

[2022-12-08 07:45:57] <%$DuranDuranDuran> Yeah they veer off and work on something like realistically simulated plate tectonics for a year LUL
[2022-12-08 07:46:01] <%+Zmpr0wler> so what do you think so far of the game
[2022-12-08 07:46:31] <$cacastainboxers> Some same sex ?
[2022-12-08 07:46:37] <$cacastainboxers> Im not against it

[2022-12-08 07:46:55] <+TheBeerinator> you can use a mouse still

[2022-12-08 07:47:55] <+BlackShi> There is a lot of unlearning to do with people who have been playing for a long time.
[2022-12-08 07:47:57] <+SpaceGhost8> it definitely threw me off, much slower with the new version
[2022-12-08 07:48:01] <%+Zmpr0wler> i heard one review of the game say it is a boiled down rimworld but 3 deminsions
[2022-12-08 07:48:03] <+TheBeerinator> also right now
[2022-12-08 07:48:11] <+TheBeerinator> it is kinda easy to crash the game
[2022-12-08 07:49:14] <+TheBeerinator> I crashed the tutorial with menuing
[2022-12-08 07:49:20] <+TheBeerinator> peepoSad
[2022-12-08 07:49:27] <!%+krainboltgreene> oh no it's a bitcoin rock
[2022-12-08 07:49:39] <%+solitude162> Chert = off-brand Flint
[2022-12-08 07:49:53] <$jackjm> it's when a liquid turns into a solid through like evaporation kinda I think?
[2022-12-08 07:49:55] <+painter42> Ok ?
[2022-12-08 07:49:59] <%Shamasu> rock wood?
[2022-12-08 07:50:04] <angrywinehouse> !please
[2022-12-08 07:50:04] <@^Moobot> @angrywinehouse Please don't spoil anything. Richard is a whiner and wants to work it out for himself. Just sit back and enjoy the Dick Hammer show.
[2022-12-08 07:50:06] <+SpaceGhost8> LUL
[2022-12-08 07:50:18] <Line_Noise> But we are learning
[2022-12-08 07:50:25] <K9kroz> I like the learning part of the stream
[2022-12-08 07:50:30] <K9kroz> CoolStoryBob
[2022-12-08 07:50:32] <$Freke48> LUL
[2022-12-08 07:50:38] <Ruinkind> Edumacation has some fancy words.
[2022-12-08 07:50:43] <K9kroz> Dioctahedral ofc
[2022-12-08 07:50:49] <+Riverdusk> @TheBeerinator there's an issue they are working on if you play it at anything but 1080p, might be your issue
[2022-12-08 07:50:51] <+Kershyll> knew that already
[2022-12-08 07:50:59] <K9kroz> who didnt know that already LUL
[2022-12-08 07:51:01] <%+doomtrout> Finally, a game that gets Dick to read
[2022-12-08 07:51:12] <%Shamasu> DF is going to results in an increased discussion about rocks about ye ol' watercooler
[2022-12-08 07:51:21] <$avgbear> Professor Dick over here
[2022-12-08 07:51:24] <K9kroz> pls do
[2022-12-08 07:51:25] <Ruinkind> The gems would interest me, tbh.  :D
[2022-12-08 07:51:29] <$avgbear> I didn't expect an educational stream
[2022-12-08 07:51:32] <Ruinkind> I like shiny stones.
[2022-12-08 07:51:44] <!%Ellieanna> break him chat, make Dick read
[2022-12-08 07:51:55] <Line_Noise> If you wish to build a Dwarf Fortress from scratch, you must first invent the universe
[2022-12-08 07:52:02] <poedelve21> why dont they just name the different clay variants simply as clay?
[2022-12-08 07:52:24] <Line_Noise> Because the variants do different things
[2022-12-08 07:52:31] <poedelve21> ok
[2022-12-08 07:52:41] <Ruinkind> The dude didn't put 20 years of his life into this game because he wanted simplicity.  I think that is safe to say.  :D  @poedelve21
[2022-12-08 07:52:46] <Line_Noise> It’s more a question whether we care about the detail on the moment
[2022-12-08 07:52:52] <Line_Noise> In*
[2022-12-08 07:53:17] <+TheBeerinator> this game simulates so much
[2022-12-08 07:53:21] <+TheBeerinator> it's actually mind boggling
[2022-12-08 07:53:46] <Line_Noise> There’s a reason the recommended CPU speed is “how much have you got?”
[2022-12-08 07:54:06] <+Woberg> are we about to send some dwarfs to their death/
[2022-12-08 07:54:10] <Satheus> their goal is to simulate existance... They believe they're about ~40% there LUL
[2022-12-08 07:56:07] <%GoRibGo> pig..tail dress? that sounds like a lot of tails
[2022-12-08 07:57:24] <$Alexsandir> Is this game any difficult to get into? I've always been interested, but ASCII turned me off.

[2022-12-08 08:19:57] <!%Calastigro> i can't believe the developers; they said in a news update/faq today that they plan to develop this game for another 30+ years
[2022-12-08 08:20:49] <%+Sswordplay> they're developer monks working on a lifelong masterpiece
[2022-12-08 08:20:57] <!%Calastigro> they sprinkled that in as part of their reason they won't be putting it on sale
[2022-12-08 08:21:02] <!%Calastigro> anytime soon, for much off
[2022-12-08 08:21:19] <Eveanore> how's the dwaf fortress goin?
[2022-12-08 08:21:40] <horseglassfeeder> If you want to know how much they care about this game, listen to the dev talk about diagonally moving boats.
[2022-12-08 08:22:25] <Eveanore> If it's okay could you call me Eve instead of Even? :p
[2022-12-08 08:22:40] <horseglassfeeder> @Eveanore Or maybe even Steven?
[2022-12-08 08:22:40] <voidnn> why would it go on sale soon. Its been out for 2 days? I keep seeing this.

[2022-12-08 20:24:17] <Exlium_> uh oh cats are taking over
[2022-12-08 20:24:53] <%Danphion> though i imagine killing rodents in a situation like this might be useful
[2022-12-08 20:25:20] <+thewolfandwild> is there some weird graphical artifacts going on for anyone else? Or just me?
[2022-12-08 20:25:35] <proxylyfe> is this still fort 2?
[2022-12-08 20:25:41] <proxylyfe> also good evening!
[2022-12-08 20:26:24] <Exlium_> my second fort is doing really well but I'm annoyed by my location a bit
[2022-12-08 20:27:09] <@%Shiverwarp> A special VIP tavern?
[2022-12-08 20:28:05] <Exlium_> could have a tavern for only the locals when they are tired of all the travellers lol
[2022-12-08 20:28:22] <Exlium_> I doubt that does anything
[2022-12-08 20:29:50] <skurke_> he sounded really important
[2022-12-08 20:29:58] <Exlium_> sounds like a non-dwarf?
[2022-12-08 20:30:27] <%Danphion> lol, i hope you carve those ceilings high enough
[2022-12-08 20:30:36] <%Danphion> so they're not banging their heads all the time

[2022-12-08 20:33:29] <%Danphion> do you even have enough bedrooms?
[2022-12-08 20:33:30] <+oxykottin> There has to be a reason for this
[2022-12-08 20:33:32] <%ANeerMiss> They're all just listening to each other write and read poetry
[2022-12-08 20:33:48] <Tenaciousorb> welcome to the bard college

[2022-12-08 20:34:04] <+oxykottin> There has to be a reason for this
[2022-12-08 20:34:08] <Exlium_> yeah I was getting annoyed I just turned off visitors
[2022-12-08 20:34:30] <mihns> Just make the bards a bunch of 1x4 bedrooms.
[2022-12-08 20:34:34] <Deleroth> why do your bedrooms have coffin rooms?
[2022-12-08 20:34:38] <+oxykottin> watch the bards refuse to dig
[2022-12-08 20:34:39] <mihns> make them live in a hole
[2022-12-08 20:34:40] <+oxykottin> too busy singing
[2022-12-08 20:35:00] <Exlium_> damn you're giving everyone their own tomb that's dedication
[2022-12-08 20:35:02] <@%Shiverwarp> @Deleroth They are ever extending tombs whenever the room resident dies
[2022-12-08 20:35:02] <Deleroth> bedrooms and deadrooms
[2022-12-08 20:35:18] <+oxykottin> @Richard_Hammer make a switch that says free sheet music, then it closes the door and floods the room with lava/water
[2022-12-08 20:35:32] <$Not_A_Spider> so when a dorf dies and a new one gets the room they'll know exactly how many previous owners there were
[2022-12-08 20:35:35] <FlobbaBob> what us the coffin room for?
[2022-12-08 20:35:37] <Deleroth> @oxykottin works every time

[2022-12-08 20:57:51] <+oxykottin> My guess is bards are stealing it

[2022-12-08 21:06:00] <+GreysonTinker> I thought the graphics would make me want to play it finally, but damn that looks way more complicated than I'm willing to get into for now. Maybe one day. Though I do love watching others play this.
[2022-12-08 21:06:22] <Deleroth> the only religion is ukulele
[2022-12-08 21:06:36] <+oxykottin> @GreysonTinker I don't think its THAT complicated, you just have a little less control then most games

[2022-12-08 21:37:35] <+oxykottin> ASCI version
[2022-12-08 21:38:55] <Deleroth> is this game faster paced than rimworld?

[2022-12-08 21:39:23] <+oxykottin> Rimworld is way more micro too
[2022-12-08 21:39:31] <+oxykottin> so that's why it feels slower

[2022-12-08 21:40:35] <+oxykottin> Just in game sound track
[2022-12-08 21:40:46] <Junglepants> That was jarring
[2022-12-08 21:40:54] <$geek2games> rimworld is a game, dwarf fort is a simulation. In rimworld randy blesses you based on your settings, in df the monsters are just roaming the world following their personalities and you just happen to be in their path.
[2022-12-08 21:41:00] <grippus_> does this song just go extra hard? Did something in game cause that haha?

[2022-12-08 21:42:15] <!%+krainboltgreene> Sadly the author doesn't have anything else like it.
[2022-12-08 21:42:54] <@%BranLan> as much as the music coming and going at random sucks it was worth it for that one moment.
[2022-12-08 21:43:43] <+ThatSl1me> how big is your military currently?

[2022-12-08 22:00:10] <%+Usinji> I wanted to do 2x1 lol

[2022-12-08 22:01:59] <%serilleous> lol do the bedrooms come with a crypt? that's fucked.
[2022-12-08 22:02:02] <smilingowl> but from my conquest of elysium lore knowledge, dwarfs are hive creatures like ants
[2022-12-08 22:03:17] <%serilleous> "This house is great!  Big windows, high ceilings, spacious living room, and a hole in the basement to put you when you die"
[2022-12-08 22:03:39] <$TwlstedReaper> Hello rooHi
[2022-12-08 22:03:50] <RingoNotStarr> dwarfs are cool
[2022-12-08 22:04:02] <Perpluid> how's the dwarfing? any fun?
[2022-12-08 22:04:53] <reds0l> Man i did not realize the scale of this game
[2022-12-08 22:05:06] <Perpluid> that's big praise coming from you!
[2022-12-08 22:05:22] <$TwlstedReaper> on just changed
[2022-12-08 22:05:43] <Perpluid> i'm very excited to try this game
[2022-12-08 22:05:45] <+ThatSl1me> hell ya bins baby
[2022-12-08 22:06:19] <Perpluid> oh also i took your advice and used pacifist and was able to beat difficulty 3, then used speedy for diff 4 and now i'm stuck on 5. speedy is also my new favorite character, so much fun
[2022-12-08 22:07:06] <Perpluid> thanks man i know its off topic but i appreciated your advice, might try pacifist on diff 5
[2022-12-08 22:07:15] <Salix__> No one died yet?

[2022-12-08 22:09:21] <+oxykottin> or is it mostly bad?
[2022-12-08 22:09:23] <Perpluid> or playing purely by what you find out intuitively?

[2022-12-08 22:11:29] <Perpluid> just asking if you can, not asking you to do it
[2022-12-08 22:11:48] <Perpluid> lol
[2022-12-08 22:13:07] <%Lakart> I got distracted with fence problems and now you have 60 minions
[2022-12-08 22:14:16] <%Lakart> Whats wrong with it?
[2022-12-08 22:14:24] <@%+JimmyNintendo> The work orders are pretty rough
[2022-12-08 22:14:32] <smilingowl> i remember that there was a background pogramm to manage workers, because it was so bad
[2022-12-08 22:14:42] <%Lakart> Oh
[2022-12-08 22:14:46] <%Lakart> That's what Add new work detail is for
[2022-12-08 22:15:21] <yukipoper> You will never find out which dwarf is the happiness Manager Sadge
[2022-12-08 22:15:41] <%Lakart> That stuff used to all be handled under Dwarf Therapist so idk
[2022-12-08 22:16:14] <smilingowl> ah yes dwarf therapist was the name
[2022-12-08 22:16:16] <yukipoper> what did the rapist do?
[2022-12-08 22:16:36] <%+Usinji> Yeah they need like color options for the roman numerals or something.
[2022-12-08 22:16:43] <%Lakart> @yukipoper got bored of the joke from the show thats been off the air for years
[2022-12-08 22:16:58] <yukipoper> which show
[2022-12-08 22:17:07] <%Lakart> arrested development
[2022-12-08 22:17:11] <%+Netzer10> whatup fellow dwarfes
[2022-12-08 22:17:36] <Perpluid> lol wait are those coffins behind the bedrooms?
[2022-12-08 22:18:08] <Nosuri1> are you enjoying dwarf fortress?
[2022-12-08 22:18:08] <yukipoper> ^ i was wondering the same
[2022-12-08 22:18:15] <yukipoper> it's like a cradle to grave pipeline
[2022-12-08 22:18:30] <%+Netzer10> one is for sleeping, one is for extended sleeping
[2022-12-08 22:18:32] <%Lakart> You keep saying engraving but I think you mean smoothing
[2022-12-08 22:18:42] <%+Usinji> Have you figured out if those bards are paying rent? Cause I have several and I don't need free loaders in my fort lol.
[2022-12-08 22:18:47] <Perpluid> lol interesting
[2022-12-08 22:18:49] <%Lakart> engraving is a level up from smoothing
[2022-12-08 22:18:50] <yukipoper> "Is my tomb clean today? Nice, carry on then"
[2022-12-08 22:18:53] <%Lakart> makes it even fancier
[2022-12-08 22:19:12] <Perpluid> you'd think it would fill them with existential dread or something
[2022-12-08 22:19:25] <%Lakart> Engraving makes the walls all detailed with runes and stories and shit like when they make art or masterwork stuff
[2022-12-08 22:19:34] <%Lakart> Trapping is hunters and fishers
[2022-12-08 22:19:39] <%Lakart> I think

[2022-12-08 22:20:21] <%Lakart> I know butchers and fishers both USE traps
[2022-12-08 22:20:59] <@%+JimmyNintendo> I want to search my work orders
[2022-12-08 22:21:08] <@%+JimmyNintendo> I am up to like 4 pages
[2022-12-08 22:21:17] <%Lakart> It's funny because I used to use a mod that broke down tasks to be granular like that in rimworld
[2022-12-08 22:21:37] <%Lakart> I also had a mod for that for rimworld, added managers
[2022-12-08 22:21:45] <+ThatSl1me> hovering the work detail and it listing its jobs would be a great QOL change
[2022-12-08 22:22:02] <%Lakart> The way it worked with the granular one was like this
[2022-12-08 22:22:15] <%Lakart> In "standard" display it was a bunch of more generic tasks, and you could go into a detailed display and adjust it more
[2022-12-08 22:22:30] <%Lakart> But yeah it would be better if it was more dwarf therapist like
[2022-12-08 22:22:57] <%Lakart> It's the one you started the game with richLUL
[2022-12-08 22:23:03] <%reds0l> what does step ladder do?
[2022-12-08 22:23:03] <%Lakart> You start with 1 stepladder and 1 wheelbarrel
[2022-12-08 22:23:14] <%Lakart> @reds0l used for high up tasks like picking fruit from trees
[2022-12-08 22:23:19] <%Lakart> automatically
[2022-12-08 22:23:32] <smilingowl> i bet someone will mod it in ore makes it steam version compatible
[2022-12-08 22:23:39] <%Lakart> IDK how they work yet either
[2022-12-08 22:23:48] <%Lakart> I just know you can assign them to storage like bins/barrels
[2022-12-08 22:23:52] <%Lakart> Never seen a dwarf use them
[2022-12-08 22:24:08] <%Lakart> The fruit picking thing explicitly mentions the step ladder requirement
[2022-12-08 22:24:36] <%Lakart> Like an animal bonding to someone in rimworld, duh
[2022-12-08 22:24:40] <Lolipopadventure> wow
[2022-12-08 22:24:42] <grippus_> you know how cats is and all that
[2022-12-08 22:24:42] <Perpluid> how often do you get attacked / raided? i guess rimworld would be a good point of reference for comparison
[2022-12-08 22:24:43] <trashpandab3ar> the cat did the adopting?
[2022-12-08 22:24:53] <%hottiefruits> just like in real life
[2022-12-08 22:24:58] <%Lakart> @trashpandab3ar That's just normal cat shit tbh
[2022-12-08 22:25:06] <Perpluid> also i'm curious if things seem more 'random' in this game or more formulaic, rimworld seemed formulaic to me
[2022-12-08 22:25:09] <trashpandab3ar> @lakart this is true
[2022-12-08 22:25:09] <Lolipopadventure> GlitchCat
[2022-12-08 22:25:10] <smilingowl> the cat desided it has an owener now
[2022-12-08 22:26:10] <Perpluid> i feel like this building with all the clicking could use some work also
[2022-12-08 22:26:25] <@%Shiverwarp> How could anyone be unhappy in this colony? You have ten million bards
[2022-12-08 22:26:26] <Esuyourmom> I just started playing yesterday and I'm struggling, any good websites to get help?
[2022-12-08 22:26:35] <Perpluid> whether it be a smaller dropdown menu that appears closer to the mouse, or hotkeys to allow you to select something without clicking
[2022-12-08 22:27:48] <Perpluid> i think i read that a lot of the hotkeys were changed or some don't even exist anymore
[2022-12-08 22:28:00] <%Lakart> Currently you can't play the steam version with pure keyboard, they mentioned that in the newest post.
[2022-12-08 22:28:24] <%+RaegisH> Meditat on murder is an interesting task
[2022-12-08 22:28:57] <Perpluid> probably a hotkey you pressed lol
[2022-12-08 22:29:12] <trashpandab3ar> wait, do you want to know how to turn them off?
