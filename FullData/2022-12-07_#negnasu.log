[2022-12-07 11:34:09] <%HenpaiDesu> Kebab is a combination of ground meat, flour or bread crumbs, and various spices cooked on a frying pan or in a grill or tandoor, whereas shawarma is a variant of kebab and is prepared from meat that is roasted vertically.

[2022-12-07 13:26:43] <%TheLastTriceratops> Just breathe out and hold the fishing rod in front of you to catch your breath
[2022-12-07 13:26:43] <CoachFate> It’s fun but I have fallen out of love with that hobby
[2022-12-07 13:26:46] <%HenpaiDesu> heres the thing neg, the game fishing simulato vr can be both played in vr or in desktop.
[2022-12-07 13:26:57] <%Rodrixam> real life has a fishing minigame, therefore, real life is a good game

[2022-12-07 13:29:19] <sleepydogzone> won't your family just mess with you if you go fishing. like he tells you to close your eyes and he makes you kiss the fish. actually fishing sounds like a good idea.

But I want to grow with everyone, and learn from mistakes. I think its actually better, to have learned from the past, than if everything is just perfect, cause you wouldnt know how things could be if it was worse, and you wouldnt be as strong i think :)
