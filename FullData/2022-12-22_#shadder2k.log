[2022-12-22 16:47:20] <destroyer12grof> this has happened to me aswell... i think it was when i was drinking coffee or monster b4 i went to sleep. and headaches and stuff like that gone away. never drink caffeeine b4 sleep it disrupts your REM state
[2022-12-22 16:47:57] <Wixion> that Ana moan though pause

[2022-12-22 16:48:22] <destroyer12grof> yeah cause after 6 hours the half caffeine goes out from your system...the half!!!!

[2022-12-22 16:49:18] <+CCGunnerr> also, try not to drink caffeine as soon as u wake up, the crash afterward leaves you exhausted when it wears off and leaves you tired the rest of the day
[2022-12-22 16:50:12] <destroyer12grof> @CCGunnerr hmmm didn't know about that though but it seems right.
[2022-12-22 16:50:25] <DanteLSD> do you sleep 11 hours in continuity or ?

[2022-12-22 18:38:25] <%+DeMo_Ninja> they should get rid of the unsheathing, and just give you the extra dash instead

[2022-12-22 18:39:19] <youngHellion> make genji a tank already
[2022-12-22 18:39:21] <ira_zor> increase all cooldowns by 4 seconds

[2022-12-22 18:39:47] VIEWERS: 1 170
[2022-12-22 18:39:49] <Sergeant_Biggls> genji should have 125 hp, his shurikens should deal 20 dmg hs, he should have 6 shurikens per magazine and they should remove his ult
[2022-12-22 18:39:58] <gtr_91> they should remove blade from his ult and remove 24 shurikens afrom ammo

[2022-12-22 20:49:32] <crazed2k> I don’t see the right click so is it animation cancel?
