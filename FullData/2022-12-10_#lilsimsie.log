[2022-12-10 21:58:57] [Announcement] <Moobot> Built something for this shell? Redeem the "request to tour your shell" point reward to put your name on the list & potentially be toured by Simsie! They're chosen randomly and this doesn't guarantee she'll see it. Donating will also not affect your chances, as we're trying to make everyone have an equal shot at being selected.

Suggestions are always appreciated, but do not attempt to make demands or force Kayla to do anything. There is a difference between friendly suggestions and aggressive demands.

[2022-12-10 23:04:13] [Announcement] <Moobot> Built something for this shell? Redeem the "request to tour your shell" point reward to put your name on the list & potentially be toured by Simsie! They're chosen randomly and this doesn't guarantee she'll see it. Donating will also not affect your chances, as we're trying to make everyone have an equal shot at being selected. I hope you understand! simsieLove
