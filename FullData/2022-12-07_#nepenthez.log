[2022-12-07 17:33:47] <%+paulmc93> 84k is a bargain

[2022-12-07 17:33:52] <%theJFKexperience0> Oh plays CDM

[2022-12-07 17:34:18] <Aaronish> yessss
[2022-12-07 17:34:20] <Aaronish> grealish
[2022-12-07 17:34:22] <%whufcconnor> Boufal looks class
[2022-12-07 17:34:25] <%+paulmc93> I missed out rip me
[2022-12-07 17:34:29] <+Zuboronovic> Grease man looks good
[2022-12-07 17:34:31] <%+aarona93> that dynamic!!!
[2022-12-07 17:34:36] <+joe90__> I’ve got a mad eridevisie squad I don’t use
[2022-12-07 17:34:37] <Aaronish> the legend
[2022-12-07 17:34:50] <Aaronish> palhinha there, another legend
[2022-12-07 17:35:03] <$Eoinft> Hawk is a very underrated chem style imo
[2022-12-07 17:35:03] <silverwolf23z> Do you know when the otw get upgraded?
[2022-12-07 17:35:03] <%+Arkuvio> 99 stam on Griezzman is insane
[2022-12-07 17:35:08] <Aaronish> i dont agree that palhinha was too much
[2022-12-07 17:35:12] <Aaronish> guys a wall
[2022-12-07 17:35:15] <@%+Owen_Slater> As someone who just got out of a fairly long rut, I think a huge issue is perspective. Think its so easy to categorise things as "crucial" or "non-negotiable", and then when you look back its laughable, but at the time its hard to see it changing
[2022-12-07 17:35:16] <%ItsTr3ple> I is back
[2022-12-07 17:35:22] <%therealcathal> i still think hes too slow

[2022-12-07 17:35:56] <Aaronish> palhinha utterly man handles people
[2022-12-07 17:35:58] <Aaronish> its great
[2022-12-07 17:36:06] <JeicoN_TK> that gomez will be insane, argentina all the way
[2022-12-07 17:36:11] <xOmsSs96> maybe refresh cuz they just got the upgrade for me in my club
[2022-12-07 17:36:11] <%DmacPrototype> @therealcathal Don't need that much pace in midfield as long as he's with someone else
[2022-12-07 17:36:29] <%ElTenTwelve_> got bruno g in my ptg pick in swaps, very blessed

[2022-12-07 17:36:37] <Kassa__> why is that?
[2022-12-07 17:36:40] <%therealcathal> @Kassa__ 6pm usually
[2022-12-07 17:36:46] <%+paulmc93> got that Bruno G from a player pick

[2022-12-07 17:36:59] <+Zuboronovic> hunder
[2022-12-07 17:36:59] <%therealcathal> how Boufal doesnt have 5* skills is a travesty
[2022-12-07 17:37:02] <+Zuboronovic> *hunter

[2022-12-07 17:46:20] <+xhavokzzx> like mbappe
[2022-12-07 17:46:23] <flashviking> Do you think CR7 knows he on the decline though 😂
[2022-12-07 17:46:28] <%+samrobinsonboi> think we'll beat france?
[2022-12-07 17:46:29] <%+Pokes21228> i have him in my global cup lineup LUL
[2022-12-07 17:46:35] <+vendetta_90> It felt like Portugal felt liberated playing without cr7
[2022-12-07 17:46:40] <+vendetta_90> All systems go
[2022-12-07 17:46:44] <%skeroboy10> The crazy thing is that Benfica's already have a kid that will be better than Ramos
[2022-12-07 17:46:46] <UrMumisCalledSteve> mbappe also misses a lot of chances for psg
[2022-12-07 17:46:50] <@%Viperlization> we have a rip
[2022-12-07 17:46:50] <%+futbolistic97> Him being benched isn't anything abnormal, the problem is his attitude and actions because he's benched
[2022-12-07 17:46:51] <@%Viperlization> big rip
[2022-12-07 17:46:55] <@%Viperlization> it's just game screen
[2022-12-07 17:46:55] <stinpickle> Messi cemented himself as #1 no more conversation needed at this point
[2022-12-07 17:46:57] <+plebalertx> Skillz was saying he should never start lol
[2022-12-07 17:46:57] <%+Pokes21228> i am less sure now after what you just said tho lol
[2022-12-07 17:47:08] <+Decland1894> Best chem style for Grealish?
[2022-12-07 17:47:09] <%ItsTr3ple> Oh dear Viper alert
[2022-12-07 17:47:09] <MickeysIce> CR7 has very low workrates
[2022-12-07 17:47:14] <@%Viperlization> I'm gonna have to grab it from stream
[2022-12-07 17:47:14] <MickeysIce> cant even get onside
[2022-12-07 17:47:30] <%$deathskamikaze> blame viper anyay
[2022-12-07 17:47:30] <deconnn20> He’s 37 years old. We’ve seen the best of Ronaldo sadly
[2022-12-07 17:47:32] <%$deathskamikaze> anyway
[2022-12-07 17:47:41] <+burns8_> Do you guys think there will be more WC Swaps tokens coming out?
[2022-12-07 17:47:53] <%skeroboy10> Nep, do u know who Henrique Araujo is?
[2022-12-07 17:48:03] <+jbrownie22> what do you think of the ps tournaments?
[2022-12-07 17:48:04] <+blythey88> was it engine on palhinha
[2022-12-07 17:48:09] <UrMumisCalledSteve> that kostic looks decent
[2022-12-07 17:48:10] <+GigaJad_> like 8 more i think, probs in store
[2022-12-07 17:48:11] <@%+Owen_Slater> I think he might be struggling with accepting that his body is slowing down, which is understandable when his level has been so high. He worked so hard to always maintain his body, but father time will always win in the end
[2022-12-07 17:48:21] <%ItsTr3ple> Is that the Brazilian kid Madrid just bought ?
[2022-12-07 17:48:22] <+xhavokzzx> when will those tokens expire so I can use them up
[2022-12-07 17:48:31] <ali_k_gaming> Brozovic is mad for 90k
[2022-12-07 17:48:50] <%KKAAMMUU> on the home screen it says the final group is out
[2022-12-07 17:48:50] <%skeroboy10> Thats the next Benfica kid after we sell Ramos and he is way more clinical.
[2022-12-07 17:48:50] <godreid> EA should’ve just said how many tokens would there be
[2022-12-07 17:49:05] <stinpickle> I hope Ronaldo just retires and doesn’t go to Saudi league
[2022-12-07 17:49:08] <%+kingnovakin> probably playing fifa
[2022-12-07 17:49:09] <stinpickle> Ruin the legacy even more
[2022-12-07 17:49:14] <deconnn20> 72£ mill for a 16 year old is crazy
[2022-12-07 17:50:11] <stinpickle> Wouldn’t be surprised if EA stop at 52 just to piss all the people who wanted to do viera and 84 x 60 off lol
[2022-12-07 17:52:07] <%skeroboy10> @deconnn20 yeah but he is really good
[2022-12-07 17:52:26] <%+big_mcmatt> what chem style would you recommend on Brozovic? Sorry If you have already said
[2022-12-07 17:52:40] <Niceandfly> Argentina not getting passed Nederlands 😭
[2022-12-07 17:52:45] <here4rewards_> @deconnn20 he isn't 'really good' no chance he is worth 70m
[2022-12-07 17:52:53] <spencej13> Do you think they will release a swap in a pack or sbc. I have 29 😂
[2022-12-07 17:52:55] <here4rewards_> maybe in 5 years time
[2022-12-07 17:52:57] <deano1123> viper with that banging edit
[2022-12-07 17:52:59] <%skeroboy10> Do u guys think England will beat France?
[2022-12-07 17:53:24] <bruhzone0> they bought vini jr at 17 for 50 mil so...
[2022-12-07 17:53:38] <JeicoN_TK> @skeroboy10 no way
[2022-12-07 17:53:47] <%ItsTr3ple> No chance @skeroboy10 (French here, so biased LUL)
[2022-12-07 17:54:02] <%skeroboy10> Same
[2022-12-07 17:54:03] <Niceandfly> France will embarrass England
[2022-12-07 17:54:04] <%BobbyTambling> Hello nepenthez
[2022-12-07 17:54:13] <spencej13> Man for man England are better then France
[2022-12-07 17:54:13] <JeicoN_TK> mbappe will run circles around slabhead
[2022-12-07 17:54:13] <stinpickle> Realistically France win it all again
[2022-12-07 17:54:22] <%ItsTr3ple> You're french ?? @skeroboy10
[2022-12-07 17:54:23] <spencej13> It depends which manager plays the most attacking will win
[2022-12-07 17:54:25] <stinpickle> Good luck stopping mbappe best footballer in the world
[2022-12-07 17:54:42] <spencej13> @stinpickle Walker will have him in his pocket
[2022-12-07 17:54:50] <%skeroboy10> @ItsTr3ple No. I said same but i was talking about France beating England. Im Portuguese
[2022-12-07 17:54:58] <%ItsTr3ple> Oh LUL
[2022-12-07 17:55:06] <%ItsTr3ple> I'm the only frenchman here ffs
[2022-12-07 17:55:11] <stinpickle> Walker prob the only defensive player quick enough to stop him
[2022-12-07 17:55:12] <%skeroboy10> LUL
[2022-12-07 17:55:23] <%ItsTr3ple> Probably cause the rest of us can't speak english for shit
[2022-12-07 17:55:35] <airball22> Sergiño Dest got his upgrade!
[2022-12-07 17:55:45] <stinpickle> But you stop mbappe and France have a loaded team beside him to score
[2022-12-07 17:56:00] <@%Witchwalker70> One's enough haHAA
[2022-12-07 17:56:10] <stinpickle> That 0-0 game against the USA made me think England won’t win the World Cup
[2022-12-07 17:56:13] <%ItsTr3ple> @stinpickle Let them focus on Mbappé LUL Free Griez and Dembélé LUL
[2022-12-07 17:56:18] <stinpickle> They got purchased by a soccer country so
[2022-12-07 17:56:19] <%ItsTr3ple> Well that was uncalled for monkaS
[2022-12-07 17:56:21] <%CeltHD> That 90 Brozovic looks so good
[2022-12-07 17:56:29] <stinpickle> Outclassed*
[2022-12-07 17:56:34] <JeicoN_TK> Portugal yesterday made me think they could win the whole thing
[2022-12-07 17:56:36] <@%Witchwalker70> Only kidding Guillaume.. D:
[2022-12-07 17:56:50] <%ItsTr3ple> Too late FeelsBadMan
[2022-12-07 17:56:52] <joao10castro> Portugal is gonna win
[2022-12-07 17:56:54] <stinpickle> Yea that was the best game Portugal played at a World Cup in like 15 years lol
[2022-12-07 17:57:03] <@%Witchwalker70> :tf:
[2022-12-07 17:57:06] <%ItsTr3ple> LUL
[2022-12-07 17:57:12] <stinpickle> Ronaldo on the bench is the answer I guess
[2022-12-07 17:57:32] <%+drobert14> lauturo martinez with a phenom card
[2022-12-07 17:57:39] <JeicoN_TK> He said he would retire if they won the world cup. Might be best for everyone, lol
[2022-12-07 17:58:02] <stinpickle> That would be perfect if he did
[2022-12-07 17:58:08] <%+drobert14> walker has pace but hes not a great defender imo, so can imagine mbappe will tear him to shreds
[2022-12-07 17:58:18] <stinpickle> But I doubt it even if they win he’ll take that massive al nassr offer I think
[2022-12-07 17:58:23] <%skeroboy10> Portugal played better because Ronaldo didn't play. When he plays, the other players are always looking for him and that makes our attack pretty obvious.
[2022-12-07 17:58:38] <stinpickle> I think Ronaldo should start against Morocco tho
[2022-12-07 17:58:49] <stinpickle> Morocco play very very tight need some aerial advantage
[2022-12-07 17:59:01] <JeicoN_TK> Why dont they start both ronaldo and ramos
[2022-12-07 17:59:02] <stinpickle> Only thing Ronaldo still can do exceptionally well is win aerial battles
[2022-12-07 17:59:08] <%skeroboy10> I bet Switzerland didn't even know who Ramos was before the game
[2022-12-07 17:59:14] <+Priceybuticey9> Where’s the lad?
[2022-12-07 17:59:24] <%+drobert14> can we all just accept that ronaldo isnt that good anymore
[2022-12-07 17:59:30] <kinggdeno> Hello whos better for CB Mascherano or Marquez? No Coins for Dijk
[2022-12-07 17:59:41] <albin554> marquez

[2022-12-07 18:00:17] <%skeroboy10> @drobert14 i already did. We was tremendous for Portugal for 20 years but now its time to accept that he isn't that guy anymore
[2022-12-07 18:00:21] <kinggdeno> I need la liga or premier legaue
[2022-12-07 18:00:24] <kinggdeno> Cb
[2022-12-07 18:00:28] <%+kingnovakin> Chairpenthez is back
[2022-12-07 18:00:40] <joao10castro> Ronaldo is gonna score in the final and retire
[2022-12-07 18:00:45] <stinpickle> I still don’t like leao being benched tho
[2022-12-07 18:00:53] <stinpickle> I think he should be starting
[2022-12-07 18:00:53] <+jennachad> whats up guys, chairpenthez here
[2022-12-07 18:01:04] <stinpickle> Way too good of a player to be subbed on minute 80

[2022-12-07 18:03:35] <@%+Owen_Slater> They acting with everything that they do like they havent collapsed the market to its knees
[2022-12-07 18:03:38] <CrazyEskimoPenguin> Deserved or not deserved, my striker rn is 91 (Auba), I'm not exactly gonna run out to replace him with an 86 David lmao
[2022-12-07 18:03:45] <flashviking> Out of interest, How many Fonzy cards have EA made over the years?
[2022-12-07 18:03:47] <%Dezalleycat> Evening nep
[2022-12-07 18:03:47] <baskbwiz> all those cards are for managerial masterpiece game play
[2022-12-07 18:03:57] <%+drobert14> i thought it was 24 and under. lauturo martinez is 25!
[2022-12-07 18:03:59] <+louisw26> That David card came out at Toty so slightly different time in the cycle
[2022-12-07 18:04:06] <@%+Owen_Slater> That David looks so so so similar to the very first objective we got this year
[2022-12-07 18:04:07] <lmsj> Waiting for an Enzo Fernandez Gullit Gang card
[2022-12-07 18:04:09] <+four_directions> Nep what chem style is good for bruno pathtoglory ?
[2022-12-07 18:04:15] <+ryjack97> interresting how 2k gives out good objective cards but the grind is so intense
[2022-12-07 18:04:20] <flashviking> What’s the current WC token count Nep?
[2022-12-07 18:04:27] <grownmenplayinggameslol> HowBoutDemCowboys y'all

[2022-12-07 18:04:34] <opaza01> anyone else struggling to get games in elite?
[2022-12-07 18:04:38] <stinpickle> I am still in favor of 2k taking over fifa
[2022-12-07 18:04:47] <@%Viperlization> yeah yeah
[2022-12-07 18:04:48] <stinpickle> Even though 2k community has issues better than EA
[2022-12-07 18:04:49] <xdready> @opaza01 no, not at all
[2022-12-07 18:04:50] <@%+Owen_Slater> That card v Richarlison is basically the same and one was released on release week
[2022-12-07 18:04:51] <@%Viperlization> we get one of them a day i hop
[2022-12-07 18:05:07] <%+drobert14> but martinez is 25! not 24 and under
[2022-12-07 18:05:13] <+four_directions> @thegoslow He mentioned it earlier
[2022-12-07 18:05:13] <adeel488> Should’ve been Alvarez instead of Martinez
[2022-12-07 18:05:19] <%whufcconnor> his nominee was an sbc aswell
[2022-12-07 18:05:22] <lb_177> also annoying they keep bringing out the same players even ones used in the current Fifa, like Mane's OTW and Path To Glory cards. now we get another Lead although we have his POTM
[2022-12-07 18:05:29] <lmsj> Enzo robbed

[2022-12-07 18:05:45] <xlpiemel> nep we love you in Somalia
[2022-12-07 18:06:09] <%+rickd96> so much and more better argentina cards to pick
[2022-12-07 18:06:20] <%whufcconnor> TOTY Nominee non performance?
[2022-12-07 18:06:23] <flashviking> I’m on 38 tokens. Get 2 more for Vieira or Gamble WC Icon on 35?
[2022-12-07 18:06:30] <KPR__7> A TOTY Nominee definitely is a performance based
[2022-12-07 18:06:32] <BenPegg10> Toty honourable mention non performance😭😭
[2022-12-07 18:06:36] <%ItsTr3ple> Commented to give the TT a kick boost, do the same lads
[2022-12-07 18:06:39] <KPR__7> Based on his performance for the whole year
[2022-12-07 18:06:42] <$Dafifabomb> Steven berghuis for 60k was a steal !!
[2022-12-07 18:06:53] <%+zedsladdie> @flashviking Vieira easy
[2022-12-07 18:06:56] <+jefzy_> @flashviking vieira, the icon pp is so bad
[2022-12-07 18:06:59] <%+Jonoskillz> He's also had a good tournamnet, should be on their radar
[2022-12-07 18:07:08] <%chrisdepot> Or give it to alvarez
[2022-12-07 18:07:09] <brynjarfth> have you seen him play nep ?
[2022-12-07 18:07:13] <%$deathskamikaze> he doesnt sell packs though, so ea dont care
[2022-12-07 18:07:13] <ma1kster> alvarez also deserves a card
[2022-12-07 18:07:13] <lmsj> Nep spitting facts
[2022-12-07 18:07:15] <%ItsTr3ple> Game changer for Arg, litteraly
[2022-12-07 18:07:19] <brynjarfth> Fairs
[2022-12-07 18:07:24] <+louisw26> He might get a future stars
[2022-12-07 18:07:25] <%+drobert14> enzo also has an own goal at the world cup :(

[2022-12-07 18:07:35] <$Dafifabomb> So if Holland beat Argentina what gets upgraded on berghuis
[2022-12-07 18:07:38] <lmsj> Benfica should have way more cards
[2022-12-07 18:07:40] <stinpickle> Ya it’s crazy enzo didn’t get a card
[2022-12-07 18:07:40] <+imythias> wanted alvares
[2022-12-07 18:07:42] <%+killa_mole> he won sell packs cuz of league
[2022-12-07 18:07:43] <%skeroboy10> Even Alvarez
[2022-12-07 18:07:47] <%+killa_mole> wont
[2022-12-07 18:07:49] <%KKAAMMUU> @Dafifabomb weak foot
[2022-12-07 18:07:49] <stinpickle> Or Alvarez lol
[2022-12-07 18:07:49] <MarioBr0ther> EA are ignoring Liga Portugal this fifa for some reason, especially when compared to MLS or Eredivisie
[2022-12-07 18:07:52] <@%Viperlization> 98 rated alvarez
[2022-12-07 18:07:53] <CrazyEskimoPenguin> @Dafifabomb 5* wf if they win
[2022-12-07 18:07:53] <@%Viperlization> loooooooooooooooooooool
[2022-12-07 18:07:53] <airball22> Bergius gets 5 star weak foot I think
[2022-12-07 18:07:54] <stinpickle> Just another Martinez
[2022-12-07 18:07:57] <%+WaxiRL> Finally got my prime back to sub!
[2022-12-07 18:08:11] <monsterkoch69> Stop complaining and enjoy this excellent content that ea bring out everyday
[2022-12-07 18:08:11] <%$DogsDayGaming> they pick the non performance before the cycle even starts
[2022-12-07 18:08:12] <@%Viperlization> this vid is 2 mins out btw
[2022-12-07 18:08:12] <zipcan> EA planned this content months ago. That's why it's so out of touch.
[2022-12-07 18:08:15] <%+drobert14> enzo fernandez's stats on fb ref are mental
[2022-12-07 18:08:15] <jacobf1717> think we should just dmit that whoever gets the card everyone will find a reason to complain about it lol
[2022-12-07 18:08:16] <@%Viperlization> about to send it over
[2022-12-07 18:08:18] <lmsj> Liga NOS > Eredivisie
[2022-12-07 18:08:18] <joao10castro> @MarioBr0ther They don't care about us
[2022-12-07 18:08:19] <%$nightfly89> the way you're hyping him up you'd think you have an nft of him neppoWin
[2022-12-07 18:08:26] <airball22> Brozovic path to glory looks insane man
[2022-12-07 18:08:28] <AntonioCrossas> Benfica in the best 8 in champs, Portugal in the best 8 in the world, we are the "top nation" with less special cards..
[2022-12-07 18:08:34] <+louisw26> Weird with the ptg them choosing defenders when the skill moves and weakfoot is slightly less desirable
[2022-12-07 18:08:37] <%+Jonoskillz> why before 6pm?
[2022-12-07 18:08:37] <@%+Owen_Slater> Lautaro gets enough Informs anyway. If they actually rewarded players for playing well by making TOTW boosts not pathetic, they could add variety and still have those same players be good
[2022-12-07 18:08:42] <%jjaden10> I swear sheriff said Enzo was getting one
[2022-12-07 18:08:45] <%+Arkuvio> Just picked up a Brozovic for 87k, looks solid
[2022-12-07 18:08:45] <monsterkoch69> Kabasele looks amazing
[2022-12-07 18:08:49] <flashviking> What happens at 6pm with squad battles?
[2022-12-07 18:08:55] <%ItsTr3ple> That's not nice, he's not finished yet he's young Kappa

[2022-12-07 18:09:27] <george0706> Has Nep covered the PTG upgrades yet?
[2022-12-07 18:09:32] <%+Pokes21228> or expand the # of promo cards, have some of the usual's but add some fun/different players
[2022-12-07 18:09:33] <daven_lakey> remember when objective cards got upgraded like that storyline politano
[2022-12-07 18:09:35] <lmsj> Gonçalo Ramos and Rafa not having special cards is criminal

[2022-12-07 18:10:26] <AntonioCrossas> EA hates Benfica

[2022-12-07 18:10:42] <%BobbyTambling> Isn’t he an objective ?
[2022-12-07 18:10:46] <lmsj> Surprised we didn't have TOTGS for UCL or WC
[2022-12-07 18:10:46] <%jjaden10> Objective
[2022-12-07 18:10:47] <+M4N5F1ELD_> Hes an Obj

[2022-12-07 18:11:16] <airball22> I think David will be alr 5 star weak foot super sub
[2022-12-07 18:11:21] <stinpickle> That 3 player pack was so depressing lol
[2022-12-07 18:11:25] <%+barnaby17> that's why he's garbage bc he's the obj
[2022-12-07 18:11:26] <%+Pokes21228> @bungy1988 and Weah and the Championship milestones
[2022-12-07 18:11:29] <%chrisdepot> Why go for David when Kyle Larin is there
[2022-12-07 18:11:42] <+leechyspoon> 2 North American Lille objectives in a row is very original from EA

[2022-12-07 18:12:59] <$jord080> I wouldn’t grind tokens I’m banned from playing matches why the fuck do ea charge us £70 for a game you get banned for playing absolute waste of a company and the people in charge need a serious look at themselves
[2022-12-07 18:13:00] <rjones86> What’s up guys nep here
[2022-12-07 18:13:07] <airball22> @stinpickle nah it’s over
[2022-12-07 18:13:17] <stemil19> neppo is odegaard europe league card decent as a cam? did you have experience playing with him?
[2022-12-07 18:13:25] <xxjr77> is this for swaps??
[2022-12-07 18:13:31] <PeppaPork_> @stinpickle Thanks, but I actually meant for Nep. I already got Vieira and Christensen
[2022-12-07 18:13:32] <stinpickle> I just don’t understand why they would release 52 tokens such a random number
[2022-12-07 18:13:33] <%+mx_fps> Lines are pink?
[2022-12-07 18:13:40] <+george0159_> Whats your fav era of any fut ever Nep? Chem gate and the first futties are up there for me
[2022-12-07 18:13:43] <Nkssbl> whats your opinion on the fact that we never get promo goalkeepers?
[2022-12-07 18:13:46] <$jord080> Sorry for the rant but your the only one who understands everyone and gives a fuck about the community
[2022-12-07 18:14:11] <stemil19> Ty neps for a quicky answer
[2022-12-07 18:14:21] <%jjaden10> They’ll be shit too, they still don’t upgrade reactions

[2022-12-07 18:15:02] <stinpickle> I pulled a untrade mid van der sar just won’t get another gk for the rest of@the game lol
[2022-12-07 18:15:11] <$MrMcMikey> theres a tab on fifa that says " fifa wc swaps week 4 the final group of fifa wc swaps objectives are now live " yet theres still 8 to come according to fut bin weird
[2022-12-07 18:15:12] <+george0159_> Been browsing old fut vids. Remember how hype the fifa 16 div 1 kit was? How times change man. Where do you think ea went wrong?
[2022-12-07 18:15:12] <+leechyspoon> take me back to the FIFA 19 league sbc grind
[2022-12-07 18:15:21] <%+SamSurg3> Nep u know all the WC Stories cards that don't have leagues give chem to each other.. they are all considered WC League .. i think they can be of some use
[2022-12-07 18:15:23] <+pyper862> are there 5 more swaps due out?
[2022-12-07 18:15:32] <+Kieran96cfc> at this point this might aswell just stick a GK in a promo, they've all been pretty bad anyway
[2022-12-07 18:15:32] <sarge199082> This World Cup promo is awful why we not getting more dynamic duos thought we would have got one for each World Cup nation and these showdown player selections are awful. They need to give us meaningful World Cup content like totgs and motm cards make it more engaging World Cup content
[2022-12-07 18:15:36] <%+RfcHarry07> how many tokens u need nep?
[2022-12-07 18:15:43] <airball22> Well I kind of see that as a positive tbh imagine how angry people would get if goalies were that broken
[2022-12-07 18:15:44] <Nkssbl> so sad tho. i dont want to play with if donnaruma all year :D
[2022-12-07 18:15:45] <justinlau29> have you done a review on all the upgraded cards
[2022-12-07 18:15:48] <stinpickle> No one knows really could be 52 tokens could be 60 like
[2022-12-07 18:15:53] <stinpickle> Not even futbin knows
[2022-12-07 18:15:53] <+whale_b1ologist> You planning on playing Diablo 4 next year @NepentheZ
[2022-12-07 18:16:02] <Bonus_Exitus> Yah just for chem sake there should be multiple goalkeepers in each promo, just add them dont replace other players
