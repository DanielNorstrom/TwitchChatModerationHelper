[2023-01-01 05:27:31] <@%+TheFogz> I can't really complain about 2022
[2023-01-01 05:27:42] <theLimitBreak> My 2022 wasn't bad. Way better than 2016 or 2020.
[2023-01-01 05:28:24] <%+Midorii7> 2022 was saku cute and 2023 saku will be cute again sakuTap

[2023-01-01 05:28:40] <@%KanmuriDaYo> I had some really good changes for me in the last quarter of 2022, so I'm looking forward to what 2023 brings. sakuSip
[2023-01-01 05:28:46] <%+Cyberchao_X> Yeah I guess 2022 was the best year for me since 2018, but that's a pretty low bar because 2020-21 were pandemic years and 2019 was when my dad died.

[2023-01-01 05:30:25] <%ZenithMedium> Yeah, this year had its ups and downs
[2023-01-01 05:30:26] <%+Cyberchao_X> Oh, but that's right, 2022 was actually the opposite of 2019 in that respect; I gained a family member! My sister had her first child in November.
[2023-01-01 05:30:49] <%tacothefox> Outside of traveling back to see family and all those Saku League wins‚Ä¶. 2022 was ok I guess.

[2023-01-01 08:19:16] <Danddjosh2000> I loved seeing people just boost off the map at the start lol
[2023-01-01 08:19:16] <%+Hyperstryke> It's when you get knocked off the track in 8 consecutive races, then being forced to defend a course record, that I generally say "Yeah, not fun anymore."
[2023-01-01 08:19:22] <ForksAreFree> Battle mode has boost enabled, I think
[2023-01-01 08:19:22] <firebird710> imagine boost on that laser map
