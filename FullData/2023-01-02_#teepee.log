[2023-01-02 19:31:29] <fr0zty_x> They gave us a beta game
[2023-01-02 19:31:30] <+blacky_120689> I think rather teep bugged and not the element xD
[2023-01-02 19:31:35] <Lockean> That one wasn't the game, to be fair.
[2023-01-02 19:31:43] <FOSEVENS> Definitely user error. He shouldn’t have left. Might’ve gotten lucky there…
[2023-01-02 19:31:43] <%zeegs33> I think there was ammo on top of the element. When you went to grab it, it said ‘inventory full’.
[2023-01-02 19:31:43] <%$BubbaOx> its not user error if they have to play around a dumb bug
[2023-01-02 19:31:51] <%vauxx9> it pickerd sniper ammo behind him on it, the Be remained in the box due no space
[2023-01-02 19:31:54] <fr0zty_x> Can’t believe we were paid 70 dollars for this

[2023-01-02 19:32:05] <%kierankieran> bit of both, weird that there was random sniper ammo on the element lol

[2023-01-02 19:32:32] <spriffles> @TeePee THERE was sniper ammo on the contract and you picked up the sniper ammo when you went to open the box so when you picked up the ball you had a full backpack
[2023-01-02 19:32:33] <%$MilkbagsActual> seriously, game needs a tab loot system like PUBG. Hit tab, shows all loot around you and your backpack, you select what you want to loot
[2023-01-02 19:32:36] <+PreludePulse> Game is buggy as hell tho still
[2023-01-02 19:32:39] <FOSEVENS> There was ammo there, tho. He just should’ve stayed in that spot till he figured out WTF was goin on…lol
