[2022-12-23 00:37:23] <$SkumoMcBee> A lot of early LGBT movies were silly horror
[2022-12-23 00:37:28] <%+EosLuna> LOL
[2022-12-23 00:37:32] <liquid_koe> The director played himself, so he really knew what he wanted out of this performance
[2022-12-23 00:37:34] <$SkumoMcBee> there's a word for it I can't think of it
[2022-12-23 00:38:02] <$Agemonugtohs> was this before or after silence of the lambs
