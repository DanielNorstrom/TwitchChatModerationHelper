[2022-12-17 16:05:12] <%kyrra_dragoon> What you could upgrade is you belt
[2022-12-17 16:05:18] <%kyrra_dragoon> for a good corrupt
[2022-12-17 16:05:27] <%+Rybsson> more like 6
[2022-12-17 16:05:46] <%+Rybsson> pretty harsh prices for horror crafting
[2022-12-17 16:06:01] <%kyrra_dragoon> but you are not using a corrupted belt ?
[2022-12-17 16:06:20] <%Zerograviti> @Pohx essence of horror is also used to craft some minion helmets
[2022-12-17 16:06:22] <%+Rybsson> horrors were for skele mages, and they are kinda dead this league
[2022-12-17 16:06:30] <svartalinjer> mostly because no essence on map device probably
[2022-12-17 16:06:38] <%+Rybsson> for absolution it's the other essence, the one with phys as extra lightning
[2022-12-17 16:06:39] <%kyrra_dragoon> no no im just saying you could get a corrupt which gives you more ?

[2022-12-17 16:55:03] <%vexnex> @ShinnyChicken League is okay. League mechanic itself is unfriendly to mapping so I don't really like it
[2022-12-17 16:55:07] <%+Mr_Titan253> @sixlets I might of missed the answer, but you need ilvl 80 for flagellant to

[2022-12-17 16:55:59] <%Vincanthofred> vexnex they should really have made it like another delve or something
[2022-12-17 16:56:07] <@%ShinnyChicken> Fair, getting toileted every map hasn't been that fun @vexnex

[2022-12-17 16:56:28] <@%ShinnyChicken> Idk why but I feel like casually mapping this league has never been so profitable
[2022-12-17 16:56:37] <%vexnex> Only currency from league mechanic feels very stale to me
[2022-12-17 16:56:43] <%vexnex> And it takes 32 maps to get a full run
[2022-12-17 16:56:45] <+RichChu> @pohx did you do anything special to make your flask go big boom or is that just how it is?
[2022-12-17 16:56:47] <%vexnex> Which for me then 1 map is 5-8 minutes

[2022-12-17 17:28:37] <+ZFPuhiOwns> hey chat, any suggestions for how to get more maps to drop? As even with a 50% scarab I had like 1-2 map drops and they weren't even a higher tier.
[2022-12-17 17:28:39] <@%donavanshepard> but yet we still get people who dont know how

[2022-12-17 17:28:49] <@%donavanshepard> @Archaius theres more to it than that
[2022-12-17 17:28:54] <exaltedcube> is this uber viable if you have decent gear or does it need mirror tier items for it?

[2022-12-17 17:30:58] <+Typicalchaz> I played inquisitor last season and jugg this season and I feel it super easy to stack armor on jugg and bo so much tankier on basically 1-2 divines

[2022-12-17 17:36:16] <@%lemoncoolers> @exaltedcube I have never died to bleed. The damage that comes from bleed is from moving while bleeding. With ralakesh you simply do not die to bleed ever.

[2022-12-17 17:38:32] <@^Nightbot> You buy/farm a set of Death or Light and Truth divination cards that gives a unique scepter. You make new level 4 character. You turn in the set on it. You vaal the scepter in the hopes it turns rare. You get other 4 rare bases of the same scepter by casually playing the game. Vendor them with the one you corrupted into a rare. Then you get a rare ilvl 4 Rare clean scepter. How to craft. On average you need 16 scorch fossils to get +1 fire and fire dot multi. - Oct0_Pus

[2022-12-17 17:45:47] <%$EugeneBeanblossom> I know why they're confused. VPN uses your existing internet connection so if that's bad, it *should* be bad through VPN *unless* your ISP packet inspects your data which is sketchy.
[2022-12-17 17:45:55] <chillstuff> <3 ya Pohx

[2022-12-17 17:53:15] <@%donavanshepard> shwarma is amazing too
[2022-12-17 17:53:16] <exaltedcube> @donavanshepard depends on who makes it xd
[2022-12-17 17:53:21] <@%lemoncoolers> you don't like lamb meat?
[2022-12-17 17:53:25] <+Sp3LLBouNDX> maybe you hate pork ?
[2022-12-17 17:53:26] <%+Gokusse> It's the lamb
[2022-12-17 17:53:32] <@%donavanshepard> @exaltedcube bad gyro makers should be punished by death
[2022-12-17 17:53:35] <+Sp3LLBouNDX> gyros is not with lamb
[2022-12-17 17:53:38] <exaltedcube> lamb meat is bussin
[2022-12-17 17:53:38] <+garydubs> im guessing he is going to a bad spot

[2022-12-17 17:53:41] <%TheMozzer> gyro feels like lamb hotdog meat or something
[2022-12-17 17:53:43] <spooper_trooper> it's the way it's cut you don't like it
[2022-12-17 17:53:44] <exaltedcube> @donavanshepard hahaha
[2022-12-17 17:53:47] <spooper_trooper> it's shaved
[2022-12-17 17:53:54] <spooper_trooper> they do
[2022-12-17 17:54:01] <spooper_trooper> they shave it off in bits
[2022-12-17 17:54:10] <lothreg> gyros is way too fatty, I like the way it's cut and the texture but the taste is too rich and too salty I agree
[2022-12-17 17:54:11] <+Haaase_> eating babys meat HUH
[2022-12-17 17:54:14] <+BigChief_95> in scotland we have the most anti-greek version of Gyros just called kebab meat and its looks like dog food and smells a bit like dog food but its so good
[2022-12-17 17:54:17] <Whiterain1000> My extended family is middle eastern, and I agree Gyros are like american chineese food. Something went wrong.
[2022-12-17 17:54:17] <@%CandyInk> I think depends as well, hard to really tell because some places taste wayy better then others
[2022-12-17 17:54:17] <lothreg> and I grew up with it so KEKLEO
[2022-12-17 17:54:23] <+Sp3LLBouNDX> did you only try one ? because here in Greece is epic
[2022-12-17 17:54:24] <@%CandyInk> some taste like overcooked/dry/plain
[2022-12-17 17:54:32] <playrosso> i love donner <3

[2022-12-17 17:56:22] <@%CandyInk> gyros are greek though
[2022-12-17 17:56:22] <lothreg> a good tl;dr is, as a Greek who's eaten both real gyro and american gyro, I wouldn't give american gyro even to a stray dog @Pohx KEKW
[2022-12-17 17:56:33] <@%CandyInk> thats Mediterranean not middle eastern

[2022-12-17 17:57:03] <+Sp3LLBouNDX> the only issue restaurants doing their own things when they sell food so they can be more salty or bland etc
[2022-12-17 17:57:04] <manserpent> Hmmge
[2022-12-17 17:57:07] <spooper_trooper> so they way they usually make that kind of sandwich (gyro, donner, etc.) is they have the big meat stick spinning and cooking and shave the meat off. But obviously sometimes the quality of that meat stick is lower than others, so that makes a big difference

[2022-12-17 17:58:58] <lothreg> ntolma is not exactly middle eastern, it's more east, it's Greek and Turkish so it qualifies as both med and mid eastern @Pohx
[2022-12-17 17:58:59] <%Vincanthofred> is your build uber eats viable?
