[2022-12-23 19:19:33] <Farkkas> yeye, samira outscales aphelios yuumi KEKW
[2022-12-23 19:19:34] <Seikyyo> COPIUM not too bad
[2022-12-23 19:19:35] <timtim412> ye he should be permabannd

[2022-12-23 19:19:38] <%+DistantDk> agree
[2022-12-23 19:19:39] <sp4ce_guy> yes
[2022-12-23 19:19:42] <%Agerbombs> reportable imo
[2022-12-23 19:19:44] <Tofulous> yes
[2022-12-23 19:19:46] <$Leo_97531> it should be bannable, if the game detects 2 smites
[2022-12-23 19:19:51] <shamybamy> maybe he is autofilll jg main and have mental boom?
[2022-12-23 19:19:52] <%+DistantDk> report it
[2022-12-23 19:19:52] <+alexthe_gr8_> I think you should not be able to select smite if you dont get jungle as your role
[2022-12-23 19:19:55] <%Aulyre> it is called refusing to play position and you can report for it in draft
[2022-12-23 19:19:55] <%+yamirasu> Hey cookie, how are you ? :)
[2022-12-23 19:19:58] <simo_simuna_hayha> It is the same as Nubrac. Unless communicated pre-game it should be considered griefing
[2022-12-23 19:19:59] <%Fahlka> Smite should be fixed on "jungler" role
[2022-12-23 19:20:05] <%+DistantDk> it can be banned, ive reported plenty that got a arning or ban

[2022-12-23 19:20:20] <MalarSYN> @alexthe_gr8_ then if someone gets autofilled JG they have to go JG instead of swaping

[2022-12-23 19:22:25] <%lWaterI> bait ping him
[2022-12-23 19:22:26] <yousseflahj> Imagine how they make unique passive for items which is more difficult than coding only one smite allowed per game. @CookieLoLxx
[2022-12-23 19:22:26] <+ElMilus> Yea and get banned for profanities in the process

[2022-12-23 19:22:40] <wildriftboi1> @unnvmed exactly
[2022-12-23 19:22:41] <SneakkyBunny> Doing this type of strats actually have penalization, IF not told beforehand and if u arent a content creator u probably get the penality anyways. Happens to TILTERELA
[2022-12-23 19:22:41] <Dwelllll> kha isnt even complaining much either I would be perma typing

[2022-12-23 19:22:53] <xylliot> this is why i dont play adc anymore
[2022-12-23 19:22:55] <simo_simuna_hayha> Not worth mental energy to try. Just pretend it is a long dodge and ff.

[2022-12-23 19:45:41] <shamybamy> yes
[2022-12-23 19:45:43] <%+CrankyOM> least popular because people do not take the time to learn it.  It's also the most rewarding role

[2022-12-23 19:46:17] <sckb0y> i switched from ADC to mid and even mid feels better in comparison lol
[2022-12-23 19:46:20] <kaitomiqi> not only adc sadly

[2022-12-23 19:46:36] <kaitomiqi> if you want to climb just abuse the meta and play broken shit
[2022-12-23 19:46:37] <%La_Sigma> it was so good
[2022-12-23 19:46:40] <%+Jeraijin> I think ADC got hurt the most due to the crit changes

[2022-12-23 19:46:48] <ke1ox> Durabilty patch was the best
[2022-12-23 19:46:48] <%elrnar> Mundo goes wherever he pleases
[2022-12-23 19:46:48] <+LuckyToine> the tank meta is HARD on adcs
[2022-12-23 19:46:52] <%+trelastomialo> its not the game its the players
[2022-12-23 19:46:59] <+Nostram> do you think pre-season is an indication of how Season 13 will be?
[2022-12-23 19:46:59] <+Alexistanders> adcs xD
[2022-12-23 19:47:01] <Insomniod> @CookieLoLxx back to the sej thing, theres already a ton of things you can do out of meta in the game, there should be no argument that double jg in place of supp isnt trolling. the role is support. if mid or top abandonded lane every1 would agree its reportable
[2022-12-23 19:47:01] <%BabyNevi> its just the fucking items

[2022-12-23 19:47:07] <%JJ_Pinkman> this is literally the worst preseason for adcs by far since like 5 seasons
[2022-12-23 19:47:07] <kaitomiqi> go top spam mundo and mord..etc
[2022-12-23 19:47:07] <+ogPhips> game is garbage right now tbh
[2022-12-23 19:47:08] <Yinmys> that happens every preseason i think
[2022-12-23 19:47:08] <ke1ox> But i have no idea why even add the durablity patch and then comes this preseason
[2022-12-23 19:47:08] <goodboigoat65> yes, mainly because they buffed every roll except ADC
[2022-12-23 19:47:09] <%ma5tercard> @dogvader_ Yeah. I already got the same player but he was nunu. So, i figured out, and took Sivir. Because i can farm from far and spell sheild
[2022-12-23 19:47:10] <%0scarino_> Adc crying yawn xDD
[2022-12-23 19:47:16] <+AViNIU> they have to reduce damage from tanks a lot
[2022-12-23 19:47:21] <yetiyku> but its mainly the items not champs
[2022-12-23 19:47:23] <Genaoo> bruisers have been getting stronger and they are in an absurd state rn
[2022-12-23 19:47:26] <%BabyNevi> bruisers have been op every year smh
[2022-12-23 19:47:29] <greakysu> i hope they dodge so i can snipe :tf:
[2022-12-23 19:47:30] <garlicgaming007> what would you think would be a good buff for the adc role?
[2022-12-23 19:47:30] <Kiro369> @goodboigoat65 they kinda did with Durability
[2022-12-23 19:47:43] <@%T1mbits> you cant buff adc role

[2022-12-23 19:49:02] <%+barbazzul> I really think tank meta is healthy, because it makes fights more interesting, instead of one shot meta. It opens up space for adc to shine.
