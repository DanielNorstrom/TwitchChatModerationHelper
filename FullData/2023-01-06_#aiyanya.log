[2023-01-06 09:17:46] <!%+Edrem> work from home, crypto, and flooding near the factories created an extremely bad chip shortage

[2023-01-06 09:17:55] <tboneninja_> um, so, I normally play genshin impact, but the first game I would get would have to be Battlefield V its my favorite of the Battlefield games, but if I could, i would get genshin impact next. they are my two favorite games rn

[2023-01-06 11:07:55] <Snowwraith> Hence why glamour dressers have limits on storage.
[2023-01-06 11:08:08] <Snowwraith> Welcome to expansion number 3. Here's a tutorial on how the game works.
[2023-01-06 11:08:12] <!%+The_Haytch> just download more ram for the test servers
[2023-01-06 11:08:12] <%thatgirljordon> Spaghetti Code with Marinara and meatballs LOL
[2023-01-06 11:08:30] <@%Dark_Fable> You 100% know yoshi wants more user friendly systems, but he got handed the spaghetti code XD cant fix unless they make a new game
[2023-01-06 11:08:38] <TheresADesign> scream if you need help
[2023-01-06 11:08:43] <MephistoPan> Btw the new rigged model is sick

[2023-01-06 11:09:03] <Snowwraith> The objective list.
[2023-01-06 11:09:19] <TheresADesign> t skill shows up after a while
[2023-01-06 11:09:36] <MephistoPan> And I still think the guy should do a podcast or audio book with that sexy voice <3
[2023-01-06 11:09:49] <+Ancaron> you can also activate your signet on "3" and use weapon skill "R" or "G" for a combo
[2023-01-06 11:09:50] <!%dyseal> Yes
[2023-01-06 11:09:55] <+Ancaron> o the jump as well
[2023-01-06 11:10:19] <Snowwraith> The game didn't have a tutorial for these things at any point, so they put one in here.
[2023-01-06 11:10:36] <+Ancaron> IT says "combo field" or "combo finisher" in the skill description
[2023-01-06 11:10:39] <Snowwraith> In skill descriptions they will say "combo field" or "finisher".
[2023-01-06 11:10:43] <TheBassett> A grey heart with "Combo: Area healing" will appear on combo. Field + Finisher = combo
[2023-01-06 11:10:55] <TheBassett> Each skill reads either field or finisher if it's one of em :)

[2023-01-06 11:11:10] <%thatgirljordon> as JoCat says "Read your Tooltips!"
[2023-01-06 11:11:29] <!%+The_Haytch> tooltips cant stop me, im a gamer i dont need tutorials
[2023-01-06 11:11:40] <!%+The_Haytch> the game should just be natural and intuitive to my gamer brain

[2023-01-06 11:11:46] <!%+The_Haytch> if it isnt its not a good game
[2023-01-06 11:11:51] <Snowwraith> They'd also not had a defiance bar tutorial anywhere in the game ever seen reworking defiance.
[2023-01-06 11:11:58] <TheBassett> So leave a field on the ground (fire, lightning, smoke etc.) and use a finisher on it (leap, whirl, blast etc.) to make a combo :)
[2023-01-06 11:12:46] <TheresADesign> defiance and combo finisher skill light up as well depending on context
[2023-01-06 11:12:58] VIEWERS: 140
[2023-01-06 11:13:13] <+Co0O0okies> you have to do it a couple times in a row I think
[2023-01-06 11:13:44] <TheresADesign> you can just move out
[2023-01-06 11:13:59] <Snowwraith> You just not get hit for 5 attacks in a row.
[2023-01-06 11:14:05] <TheresADesign> and you can dodgeroll the jumpwave
[2023-01-06 11:14:34] <Snowwraith> He also has a kick he can just hit you with in melee if you're too close.

[2023-01-06 11:19:17] <Snowwraith> Any CC works. So stuns and knockbacks and pulls are the big ones.
[2023-01-06 11:19:57] <Snowwraith> But also debuffs like immobolise/chill/cripple/blind will tick their bar down for their duration.
[2023-01-06 11:20:01] <@%Dark_Fable> Imma brb gonna have a shower

[2023-01-06 11:21:04] <!%LulubyVT> that shooter class looks so cool
[2023-01-06 11:21:07] <TheresADesign> autoattack only has 20% chance to be a finisher
[2023-01-06 11:21:31] <@InfiniteYeet> It says finisher
[2023-01-06 11:21:31] <Snowwraith> Yeah a lot of ranged basic attacks don't trigger every one.
[2023-01-06 11:21:40] <!%LulubyVT> carc0sMeruWOW
[2023-01-06 11:22:43] <Snowwraith> Usually melee weapons have the last attack in the auto combo be a finisher, ranged weapons usually only have a 20% to trigger one as they don't have a combo.

[2023-01-06 11:24:16] <TheresADesign> you can also swap granede kit for something you like more
[2023-01-06 11:24:26] <@InfiniteYeet> Your active removes the passive though so its situational otherwise you want to keep the passive for your condi damage. Like XIV this stuff is super poorly explained
[2023-01-06 11:24:53] <Snowwraith> The defiance bar thing is because they reworked the whole defiance system in HoT.

[2023-01-06 17:08:31] <haiddon> not the same gravy
[2023-01-06 17:08:38] <%Dang_old_Dixie> might be thinking of different biscuits
[2023-01-06 17:08:39] <%Mellentt> different biscuits
[2023-01-06 17:08:40] <@%$DosesMimosaz> u should be asking are we thinkin same biscuits
[2023-01-06 17:08:46] <@%Dark_Fable> American biscuits aren't like our biscuits right?
[2023-01-06 17:08:46] <+Onmyoujin> So American biscuits are, like... soft rolls, very flaky.  The gravy is basically a peppery bechamel made with sausage or bacon grease.
[2023-01-06 17:08:52] <!%+The_Haytch> goddamn americans calling not biscuits "biscuits"
[2023-01-06 17:08:55] <%+Boxes2142> gravy AND salsa verde? Idk about that man
[2023-01-06 17:09:00] <!%+The_Haytch> just call it bread
[2023-01-06 17:09:00] <@%Dark_Fable> Biscuits to us jin ar cookies
[2023-01-06 17:09:01] <+Onmyoujin> It's a soft, crumbly bready roll, served hot.
[2023-01-06 17:09:02] <@%$DosesMimosaz> american biscuits are basically bread
[2023-01-06 17:09:15] <+Onmyoujin> Right, they're most like a scone.
[2023-01-06 17:09:22] <+Onmyoujin> Just unflavored.
[2023-01-06 17:09:35] <%SpikeyFireStorm> @DosesMimosaz yeah arnt they closer to Scones as we know them?
[2023-01-06 17:09:46] <%Dang_old_Dixie> Though tbh the gravy in the mind is also different to the gravy poured upon the missimagined biscuit

[2023-01-06 17:34:20] <miichika> This game has a Bard class? I might check it out for that reason alone.
[2023-01-06 17:36:05] <miichika> are the characters preset classes or do you get to customize the party?

[2023-01-06 17:38:01] <%SpikeyFireStorm> apparently its a common misconception that wolf packs have an "Alpha" Wolf
[2023-01-06 17:38:07] VIEWERS: 261
[2023-01-06 17:38:08] <%+Boxes2142> There are class tokens in the game that you can equip that give stat buffs and class skills so there is a bit of customization

[2023-01-06 17:39:50] <+seaearthandsky> I was about to say the same thing, holy hell you been going for a while limesLUL
[2023-01-06 17:39:50] <+Onmyoujin> @SpikeyFireStorm Yeah... the original study was shown to be wrong based on later observations.  Apparently the "alpha" they thought they'd been observing was actually the mother of most of the other wolves in the pack.

[2023-01-06 17:40:40] <haiddon> yeah the alpha dynamic only really appears in closed and super stressful environments for the pack. normally they're more like a family
[2023-01-06 17:41:01] <+seaearthandsky> if I remember right the original theory behind the whole alpha thing also started from a study conducted on wolves in captivity which horribly fucked the normal dynamic wolves have
