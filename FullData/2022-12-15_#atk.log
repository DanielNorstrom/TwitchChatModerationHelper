[2022-12-15 17:58:08] <+xkratoasty> is it me or there's zero hype on brel at all. Most of the people I know just talk about how annoying it is to pug and how burn out they are even with these "new" contents

[2022-12-15 17:58:56] <+bjoernsenxo> yo atk, how long do you need for lvl 10gem? with 24 char? naturally ofc
[2022-12-15 17:59:00] <%+layzzzer> I feel like a lot of people make this game a 2nd job
[2022-12-15 17:59:00] <+xkratoasty> yeah I think stacking Max rested on everything 1490s backfired on a lot of people
[2022-12-15 17:59:01] <iTakerr> heard it repeated a bunch up till brel finally came out that brel is the litmus test for people quitting lol

[2022-12-15 17:59:41] <Sazuske> @bjoernsenxo depends on ilvl but it's not that long, I already have a lvl 10 with l11 extra level 7s and I only have 9

[2022-12-15 17:59:47] <%+Kliiitsch> @bjoernsenxo depends on how many bboss rushes u get
[2022-12-15 17:59:51] <+xkratoasty> I got a friend who woke up at 5 AM to run all the rested on his alts and he talked about how he hated the game after 10 hours of dailies on his 1490s and the new guardian Cali pugs lol
[2022-12-15 17:59:52] <%+LZ96> i have 14 1490.. theres no way im even gonna attempt to do more than 2-3 lol
[2022-12-15 17:59:54] <sad_jen> Despairge
[2022-12-15 17:59:57] <+strongpoon> 10 characters will get you a 7 gem in around a week.
[2022-12-15 17:59:59] <spiderrandomnumber> I mean just get a tryhard static that does 6x brel xD
[2022-12-15 18:00:01] <167Richard167> atk are u gonna ever make a juiced character in NA/EU?
[2022-12-15 18:00:10] <sad_jen> kuku is the best raid, hands down
[2022-12-15 18:00:26] <greataipe> brel is fun, cali can go to hell
[2022-12-15 18:00:31] <%+LZ96> @strongpoon 10 character will be around 2 days for 1 lv7 gem
[2022-12-15 18:00:34] <opwp_madruski> @strongpoon 10 characters will also make you hate the game aswell KEKW
[2022-12-15 18:00:48] <167Richard167> i enjoy the 4 man raid of clown much more than 8 mans
[2022-12-15 18:01:01] <%Vyse_Hex> @xkratoasty bro make a choices and blame others KEKW
[2022-12-15 18:01:12] <+strongpoon> you need 27, level 7 gems for a 10.  So around 12 weeks with 24 characters for a level 10 gem (maybe less).   If you do boss rushes on those, then it's shorter.
[2022-12-15 18:01:31] <%+LZ96> ofcourse u do br...

[2022-12-15 18:05:08] <+Jewsus27> until they just ghost you
[2022-12-15 18:05:10] <greataipe> just clown and valtan
[2022-12-15 18:05:10] <%+FearMyMango> @iTakerr its okay dude i get refused in valtan hm as a 1490
[2022-12-15 18:05:12] <+ShesASavage> fomo is a you problem anyway
[2022-12-15 18:05:13] <VanillaRaspberries> @iTakerr can relate, i have 3 chars at vykas normal and they have 6 at vykas hard...
[2022-12-15 18:05:18] <+CoopSeason> guild vendor not having new chests is hella annoying tho pepeW
[2022-12-15 18:05:32] <iTakerr> so for example if i have a friend that has like 3 or 4 1490's and im not even at clown yet, lol
[2022-12-15 18:05:32] <Lecaf> fall behind = cant mvp LUL
[2022-12-15 18:05:35] <+specialaskilled> yooo atk come back to the game after 2-3 months break got a 971 keen blunt ambush rock ':D
[2022-12-15 18:05:37] <+xkratoasty> for lot of people always gotta maximize everything every weeks and if you try to do that this is a full time job. I literally play the game at work doing dailies cause I WFH and even then still can't finish lot of things near end of weeks but idc. Others people have issues with not being able to min max every single things
[2022-12-15 18:05:37] <Dessari> fall behind = not keeping up with the rest .. I think
[2022-12-15 18:05:38] <%+layzzzer> my friend just started hes 1415 were gonna valtan wtih him later
[2022-12-15 18:05:42] <Lasdox> only content to fomo is skin cause they never comeback, raid are here for at least the next 2 years
[2022-12-15 18:05:47] <167Richard167> do you feel like we should be able to play our mains more  instead of doing all this alt stuff?
[2022-12-15 18:05:58] <%Eunactes> i have a friend new to the game and i just did valtan with him on my main bard
[2022-12-15 18:06:07] <Hatchid> ego is the problem
[2022-12-15 18:06:09] <locomash> i came back from a long break (cleared vykas) and i dont feel like im missing out or something
[2022-12-15 18:06:09] <%andredablio> well... I helped my mokoko friend with some gold and materials so he could get to 1490 to do Brel with us
[2022-12-15 18:06:14] <%Coldestwinter> FOMO is a MF
[2022-12-15 18:06:15] <%Vyse_Hex> @xkratoasty then isnt that their issue and their choices? why blame other to begin with is the question here
[2022-12-15 18:06:18] <iiamterry> probably just wanting to catch up with as many alts..
[2022-12-15 18:06:19] <Yuricomfy> maybe he is not even 1415 KEKW
[2022-12-15 18:06:34] <+12345norden> if can carry u let him carry u?
[2022-12-15 18:06:37] <spiderrandomnumber> My static pushed to 6*1490 and now I have noone that does vykas with me and I have to pug xD
[2022-12-15 18:06:38] <Kluzien> i'm behind Dentge
[2022-12-15 18:06:42] <%Coldestwinter> Thats on you!
[2022-12-15 18:06:44] <%+FearMyMango> mr @ATK can you remind people taht 1490 is more than good for valtan HM? :( My shadowhunter/gs/iron man keeps getting denied :(
[2022-12-15 18:06:51] <%Coldestwinter> nobody told you to feel that way
[2022-12-15 18:06:56] <iTakerr> eh different mindsets i suppose
[2022-12-15 18:06:57] <+Jewsus27> i wish i could get a carry
[2022-12-15 18:06:59] <Neoxer_> Dentge
[2022-12-15 18:07:06] <%+Saphy91> @FearMyMango well i would ask the question why is that xD
[2022-12-15 18:07:08] <zen__o_o> @xkratoasty FOMO kicking in hard chill i dont have a single brel character i dont care its not gnna run away
[2022-12-15 18:07:09] <%andredablio> @FearMyMango do busses, gives more gold and its easy
[2022-12-15 18:07:09] <pacoman> @FearMyMango are u that guy that doesnt use auction house
[2022-12-15 18:07:12] <%+diiarmuid> i started behind they carried me (well they needed a support) now it's fine
[2022-12-15 18:07:20] <VanillaRaspberries> i can see it being bad if ur friends are running brel hard and you're running brel normal
[2022-12-15 18:07:22] <%+robyn_hode> that friend doesn't know.... getting carried is the best... haha free gold
[2022-12-15 18:07:24] <Unpuree> i have no friend playing this game  Sadge

[2022-12-15 18:07:27] <Adrian10198> i literally pugged all the raids from the start till now, so w/e you can do it
[2022-12-15 18:07:47] <Lecaf> the experience thing is totally legit tho, but they shouldn't be playing an infinite vertical scaling game like LA
[2022-12-15 18:07:48] <%+FearMyMango> @FearMyMango i havent tried to solo valtan bus yet. idont know if i'm good enough to solo bus i do want to learn

[2022-12-15 18:20:19] <%lostsoulz1010> ugh boss portal on bard again, always bard
[2022-12-15 18:20:21] <Marcus_Heisenberg> @Stoopzz true KEKW
[2022-12-15 18:20:43] <!%Stoopzz> 5-6 for new people is hard so it takes awhile
[2022-12-15 18:20:45] <yamiM0NSTER> He was devastated that his team was dying to same stuff over and over and it was same people
[2022-12-15 18:20:46] <pacoman> prokel is one of the funnest things ive ever done in this game
[2022-12-15 18:20:49] <%alexgoham> ty for the guide videos mr atk they helped a lot
[2022-12-15 18:21:03] <Jbtckt> Tunnel vision
[2022-12-15 18:21:04] <+Henrayy94> G1 was pretty easy but those orange orbs in g2 are so dumb lol
[2022-12-15 18:21:07] <serenasirena> it's like people going into learning party and quit raid after 2 wipe
[2022-12-15 18:21:11] <honneylemz> they had a hard time understanding gate 6 which was frustrating for him
[2022-12-15 18:21:12] <261622> g5 was definitely easier than g4
[2022-12-15 18:21:16] <%+deadlypants112> @yamiM0NSTER who ?
[2022-12-15 18:21:18] <%+FearMyMango> @dNie_ thats the thing with NA players. One wipe means jail and whoever caused the wipe should be out right away. It's always no mistakes allowed
[2022-12-15 18:21:20] <+Azazelli> yeah but not like 100 times
[2022-12-15 18:21:22] <yamiM0NSTER> @yamiM0NSTER Zeals
[2022-12-15 18:21:33] <Aginuzc> He said 5 times is fun 10 times is cute but he did it like 50 times on the same mech lol
[2022-12-15 18:21:34] <Kinesys> but it gets to a point were try parties converts into jail, ppl can die so much for the same shit over and over again lol
[2022-12-15 18:21:46] <%+deadlypants112> @yamiM0NSTER bruh its a new thing he should not expect ppl to get it down insta like him who have done it 100+ times
[2022-12-15 18:21:55] <rekklees77> measn you didnt tried guild wars 2 raids
[2022-12-15 18:22:03] <+dNie_> @dNie_ I play on SA, and Valtan now a days if you miss orb mech twice its a quit, and I think that's fair in a reclear party, but brel just came out
[2022-12-15 18:22:03] <+CoopSeason> I rolled so many shit bracelets and my friend gets circle on his first roll Smadge
[2022-12-15 18:22:04] <rekklees77> if one day is a jail
[2022-12-15 18:22:11] <%+LZ96> swift attack and crit +98 bracelet...
[2022-12-15 18:22:21] <+Netheraxx> @ATK can you go straight to brel gear from argos gear? to get relic set. or have to go through valtan/vykas gear?
[2022-12-15 18:22:22] <%+LZ96> damn..that crit is sooo high
[2022-12-15 18:22:23] <yamiM0NSTER> @yamiM0NSTER if you die to same thing over and over and don't analyze and try to fix that then u know
[2022-12-15 18:22:30] <!%Stoopzz> I don’t think getting all the way to last boss in a new raid is a jail bro lol
[2022-12-15 18:22:41] <!%Stoopzz> It’s a brand new raid and it’s long
[2022-12-15 18:22:45] <+RainyDay34> I would burn out so hard
[2022-12-15 18:22:46] <+dNie_> @Netheraxx you have to have full relics
[2022-12-15 18:22:46] <+RainyDay34> if i did that
[2022-12-15 18:22:47] <honneylemz> they we're 10 hours into that try party already at that point so it's understandable that some people are mentally checked out
[2022-12-15 18:22:49] <ifndefdefine> Jail is what Vykas is now Sadge
[2022-12-15 18:22:52] <Adrian10198> @Netheraxx maximum for argos gear is +20. i do not recall what ilvl  is that
[2022-12-15 18:23:03] <+Henrayy94> Getting to g6 day one is deff not jail yeah lol
[2022-12-15 18:23:09] <@%+Shikiro> +20 legendary Argos gear is 1490
[2022-12-15 18:23:12] <%doangie> ikr cause it’s legit progging not clearing lol
[2022-12-15 18:23:17] <+dNie_> +20s is enough for Ilv, but you need an achievment for full relics i believe
[2022-12-15 18:23:20] <+Netheraxx> @Adrian10198 i am 1490 in full argos gear
[2022-12-15 18:23:24] <Kinesys> Sure but Brel has been nerfed over and over again, akkan was new, no guides no nothing
[2022-12-15 18:23:24] <%Vyse_Hex> @ifndefdefine my man understand the pain KEKW
[2022-12-15 18:23:24] <%lostsoulz1010> stoopzz was jailed as lantern god
[2022-12-15 18:23:36] <167Richard167> lantern god
[2022-12-15 18:23:50] <csr_roman> its called progging no? how is it considered jail, you're getting first hand experience KEKL
[2022-12-15 18:23:59] <Everboy8> bruh im still stuck on the cube
[2022-12-15 18:24:04] <!%Stoopzz> It’s a bad mentality to have for new people

[2022-12-15 18:24:23] <+dNie_> gate 1 is guardian level easy at least
[2022-12-15 18:24:27] <heepon1> for me gate 1 and 2 was really really chill and fun, i will park my sub characters there just to avoid vykas
[2022-12-15 18:24:27] <167Richard167> 4 is the hardest gate lol
[2022-12-15 18:24:27] <Sobyi> i didnt even start the raid yet KEKW
[2022-12-15 18:24:40] <+thsteven13> is 3 easy?
[2022-12-15 18:24:41] <%+Saphy91> i mean like back in the days we progressed weeks on some bosses in wow xD in LOA everyone expects to clear the raid 1st day haha :D
[2022-12-15 18:24:47] <%doangie> i’m lucky to have a static who wanna learn the mechs  regardless of how many retries
[2022-12-15 18:24:54] <+astar_eswa> can't even continue brel cause i lost entry due to DC Smoge
[2022-12-15 18:25:01] <+ApollosTimePiece> my party spend 4 hours g2 progging prokel on differnt players to see who can do it best and we all had a blast like wtf are you guys talkin about
[2022-12-15 18:25:03] <+dekonuz> we still have people failing vykas typing test. I have very little faith for brel pugs
[2022-12-15 18:25:30] <Sobyi> FUN wtf
[2022-12-15 18:25:38] <167Richard167> theres no way to fix the PUG experience... thats up to the players
[2022-12-15 18:25:43] <261622> my clown pugs are better than vykas pugs though
[2022-12-15 18:25:46] <partypinglon> @yamiM0NSTER that prob wont happen. in the interview with roxx, she said that we will always be behind a few month due to localisation stuff. so you will always be able to watch a stream or smt
[2022-12-15 18:25:49] <%+FearMyMango> can't wait tos ee the expert lobbies 10+ clears only by next reset for brel
[2022-12-15 18:25:52] <!%Stoopzz> I think if it didn’t reward gold
[2022-12-15 18:26:01] <!%Stoopzz> People would think differently lol
[2022-12-15 18:26:11] <imperialsus> bro ddnt had fun in this game since lunch i have 6 1490 and getting jailed every kal
[2022-12-15 18:26:19] <+Henrayy94> I hope NA gets the raid after Akkan the same time as KR somehow so na has no guides 🤣

[2022-12-15 18:29:21] <167Richard167> is brel harder than akkan?
[2022-12-15 18:29:28] <+dekonuz> @Kinesys there's already enough gatekeeping. Stats can be skewed by a lot of things
[2022-12-15 18:29:42] <%+LZ96> 1490 chaos dungeon without rest doesnt give much stones =/
[2022-12-15 18:30:01] <Munnes> @167Richard167 maybe yes, but in terms of gear requirement i feel like Akkan is pretty hard
[2022-12-15 18:30:02] <Kinesys> gatekeeping happens anyway, give ppl better tools to gatekeep, number of kills, mvps, mecanics completed,etc
[2022-12-15 18:30:25] <imperialsus> g4 brel is my definition of hard
[2022-12-15 18:30:34] <%lostsoulz1010> does akkan hit really hard cause less mechs?
[2022-12-15 18:30:37] <inquisitorgm> Akkan doesnt have dps check so its easier
[2022-12-15 18:30:45] <rekklees77> who is harder in your oppinion, brel or akkan? on hard mode
[2022-12-15 18:30:51] <inquisitorgm> If its a boss with fight fight fight but no time limit ur good
[2022-12-15 18:31:09] <!%Stoopzz> Akkan does have a DPS check lol
[2022-12-15 18:31:23] <inquisitorgm> Hmmmm when ? I dont remember actually
