[2022-12-17 11:04:15] <Swequn> The story completely lacked tension for me. Hated Silco all the way through, never thought his action had valid motivation
[2022-12-17 11:04:16] <reeks_of_havyk> Did anyone else get dishonored vibes from the animation in arcane?

[2022-12-17 13:18:09] <%purple_boi69> Honestly peepo painting is a pretty good alternative tho... or hold out till jhonk brings back squats and wreak havoc
