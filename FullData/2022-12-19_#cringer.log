[2022-12-19 15:44:25] <+ElTankoJoe> Yeah
[2022-12-19 15:44:38] <%$k_nord> you need flux, pig iron and coal
[2022-12-19 15:44:40] <+ElTankoJoe> You need flux, pig iron, charcoal or coke, and iron
[2022-12-19 15:44:41] <Sax850> You need pig iron bars, flux stone and iron bars
[2022-12-19 15:44:42] <+MrMarblz> How do you move furniture like tables?  I marked it for disposal but nothing has happened for a long time (and I do have a refuse stockpile for it to go to)
[2022-12-19 15:44:49] <DadGamerC> Steel is iron + flux + coal -> pig iron (step 1), then iron + pig iron + flux + coal -> steel (step 2)

[2022-12-19 15:46:18] <DadGamerC> Steel is 2 steps: iron + flux + coal -> pig iron (step 1), then iron + pig iron + flux + coal -> steel (step 2)

[2022-12-19 16:50:01] <+ElTankoJoe> Congrats, the only stronger thing than steel in this game is adamantium.
[2022-12-19 16:50:15] <%semmy1981> @Cringer dont you find loosing dwarfs in DF is much more satisfying and fun. In rimworld and other games its so hatefull
[2022-12-19 16:50:15] <Sax850> shhhhhh @ElTankoJoe
[2022-12-19 16:50:54] <+ElTankoJoe> Death in Rimworld is a tragedy, Death in Dwarf Fortress is a statistic.

[2022-12-19 16:51:21] <%semmy1981> i feel deaths in DF are fun. Look at how they happen. Dwarfs fight. 1 dodges jumps down the well and drowns
[2022-12-19 16:51:29] <Sax850> The names wasn't this confusing in the classic at least from what I remember. I've struggled with the names in this version too
[2022-12-19 16:51:54] <%+flocular> battle logs are even better than in Rimworld :D
[2022-12-19 16:52:06] <%semmy1981> @Sax850 for me its confusing since i miss dwarf therapist. Therapist made the game understandable
[2022-12-19 16:52:31] <%Wraldpyk> saw another stream, where a bunch of dwarf kids were biting werecamels (and not the other way round)
[2022-12-19 16:52:41] <%Wraldpyk> yeah battle logs are fun
[2022-12-19 16:52:41] <Sax850> I mean it is nice, but I don't need it. @semmy1981 I do miss all the god damn search functionality from DFHack though and like the genuine better feel when typing things in :v
[2022-12-19 16:53:02] <%semmy1981> ghehe true true
[2022-12-19 16:53:06] <keshire> In dwarf fortress it's perfectly reasonable to throw a fistful of dwarves as sacrifices for the cause.
[2022-12-19 16:53:09] <%semmy1981> but dfhack already came a long way for the steam version
