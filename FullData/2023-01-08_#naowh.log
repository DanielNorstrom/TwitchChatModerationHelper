[2023-01-08 22:55:24] <Assirra> @Desophex Yea but the whole point is that you are supposed to get kicked off your mount and it's a no fly zone, it's the whole asthetic. But for some reason there is a giant hole  which just feels...off

[2023-01-08 23:05:13] <Assirra> tbh a big issue is that brew needs gear to even make their spec work. You need to get hit a lot to get high stagger to get those orbs.
