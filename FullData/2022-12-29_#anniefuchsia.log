[2022-12-29 16:00:01] <%JurgenRapp> Twitch is a business model: https://www.twitch.tv/creatorcamp/en/paths/establish-your-brand/new-viewer-retention/
[2022-12-29 16:00:13] <%JurgenRapp> just read the tips they give the streamers
[2022-12-29 16:00:13] <%Taylor131313> she's definitely not doing it on purpose caveBob
[2022-12-29 16:00:27] <%JurgenRapp> In fact, users who chat in their first visit are 50% more likely to come back to that channel.

[2022-12-29 16:07:24] <%JurgenRapp> but I think Quin said it well, streamers "must" talk all the time because viewers leave quiet streams and when you talk all day every day you can't think of everything you say you just make sound at the end so people won't leave the stream. So at the end of the day there will be a lot of cooked takes
