[2023-01-11 06:36:43] <Hazmodan128> Yes but not in hardmode
[2023-01-11 06:36:44] <%tw1stf> only in pre hardmode
[2023-01-11 06:36:44] <%shamwhoa> they slow it down
[2023-01-11 06:36:48] <veryanonymousbear> yes but really badly
[2023-01-11 06:36:52] <%Naicii> They stop it completely
[2023-01-11 06:36:53] <%Crysyn> Not in hardmode
[2023-01-11 06:36:55] <%Naicii> even in hardmode
[2023-01-11 06:37:04] <%Crysyn> They are only useflu before hand to stop the grass
[2023-01-11 06:37:06] <veryanonymousbear> it like a few blocks
[2023-01-11 06:37:16] <veryanonymousbear> word
[2023-01-11 06:37:16] <%+56Kyle> even if it does underground is still a problem
[2023-01-11 06:37:19] <%tw1stf> i mean, technically, because corruption cant spread on the grass the sunflowers are in but the corruption can just go around it in hardmode
[2023-01-11 06:37:25] <Hazmodan128> The gun works VERY well, but it's a pain to clean imo.
[2023-01-11 06:37:27] <%tw1stf> in pre hardmode only surface corruption really matters

[2023-01-11 06:38:16] <%volymic> sunflowers only stop spread on the 2 blocks its placed on top of, which is enough to stop grass spread in pre-hardmode which only has 1 block spread, but in hardmode the corruption can spread through stone and 4 wide gaps, so it jumps over the entire flower

[2023-01-11 08:06:32] <%maghoy> anyone familiar with downfall for slay the spire? its a bunch of mods packaged together in a neat bundle- done SO well that the devs acknowledged it by making it (un)official free DLC (giving it much more visibility than just a mod)

[2023-01-11 08:21:27] <%+quail_says_hi> The sword that shoots the scythes are good

[2023-01-11 08:21:41] <%NeopolitanTTV> beenades are pretty solid
[2023-01-11 08:21:42] <%Naicii> it's dps is too low for the later phase
[2023-01-11 08:21:49] <%+quail_says_hi> given your bridge length though its not gonna be enough
[2023-01-11 08:22:04] <%Naicii> It's like 1/10th the dps of the one you used in the fight b4
[2023-01-11 08:22:05] <WootHoop> You can't fire it behind you
[2023-01-11 08:22:23] <%+quail_says_hi> Maybe carnage ray if you feel like crafting it
[2023-01-11 08:22:30] <%maghoy> never played, but wall seems like a (quite literal) damage race
[2023-01-11 08:22:31] <%+quail_says_hi> its a mage weapon, pretty good against the wall
[2023-01-11 08:22:36] <VincentVirGoh> The projectiles seem kinda inconsistent tho, you can't really aim them
[2023-01-11 08:22:39] <%maghoy> probably want hard hitting wep

[2023-01-11 08:22:44] <%+esperath> @maghoy After players noted a resemblance between the Scout and TV pitchman Vince Offer, many requested that Valve add a reference to this in-game. With the release of the Scout Update, lines such as "If you order now, I'll throw in a second beatin', absolutely free!" and "No otha' class' gonna do dat!" were added to the game.
[2023-01-11 08:22:47] <%Naicii> Geltic blade is decent
[2023-01-11 08:22:53] <Flupperich> No
[2023-01-11 08:22:59] <Flupperich> Mouth is fine too
[2023-01-11 08:23:01] <%+RoyalJamMix> either 3 parts work
[2023-01-11 08:23:02] <%Naicii> Archerfish is also good
[2023-01-11 08:23:04] <%tw1stf> it does marginally more damage to shoot at the eyes
[2023-01-11 08:23:08] <%+quail_says_hi> the mouth has more defense than the eyes
[2023-01-11 08:23:22] <Flupperich> Either the eyes, or the mouth inbetween- The actual wall parts is what doesn't take damage.
[2023-01-11 08:23:27] <%Naicii> Eyes have no defense, mouth has like 20 or something
[2023-01-11 08:23:32] <%+quail_says_hi> yeah mouth has 20

[2023-01-11 09:17:22] <%+quail_says_hi> @DunkOrSlam  see how you have 4 platinum without even really going out of your way to money farm? thats why we said theres no point in building a moat

[2023-01-11 09:17:59] <DeadByFlesh_Light> means you cant dash for speed
[2023-01-11 09:18:00] <%Naicii> @DeadByFlesh_Light Thats for dodge
[2023-01-11 09:18:04] <%Ultimhate> Hi chat, hello Dunk
[2023-01-11 09:18:04] <%Naicii> You can still dash
[2023-01-11 09:18:08] <DeadByFlesh_Light> oh you can ?
[2023-01-11 09:18:13] <%+quail_says_hi> you can still dash while the dodge is on cooldown yeah
[2023-01-11 09:18:15] <ArthurAshford> aren't you in hardmode?
[2023-01-11 09:18:15] <%+PirateBadgers> the cooldown is just the iframe component ye
[2023-01-11 09:18:21] <DeadByFlesh_Light> oh cool then
[2023-01-11 09:18:23] <%Naicii> the 30s cooldown is basically evading an entire attack once every 30s
[2023-01-11 09:18:29] <%Naicii> you can still dash as much as you want
[2023-01-11 09:18:29] <DeadByFlesh_Light> thought you cant dash at all 30 s
[2023-01-11 09:18:31] <ArthurAshford> First thing I do in hardmode is usually to go get harpy wings or something similar
[2023-01-11 09:18:33] <Flupperich> @DeadByFlesh_Light You can still dash as much as you want, but they don't give iframes during that cooldown
[2023-01-11 09:18:35] <DeadByFlesh_Light> makes sense
[2023-01-11 09:18:45] <DeadByFlesh_Light> then its nice

[2023-01-11 09:25:27] <%Aldizzert> One thing Kinders have going for them is they can be consumed quickly.
[2023-01-11 09:25:34] <%WaxNumen> Not American chocolate, it's just Hershey's KEKW
[2023-01-11 09:25:37] <WootHoop> There's a deep lore reason
[2023-01-11 09:25:47] <Muxailo> Hershey or smth like that it's named
[2023-01-11 09:25:52] <%+Ruthbane> central american chocolate is POGGIES
[2023-01-11 09:25:53] <RiftingFlotsam> It's from butiric acid or something like that
[2023-01-11 09:25:58] <WootHoop> Some weird recipe Hershey invented that barely meets FDA stamdards
[2023-01-11 09:26:00] <%maghoy> according to google, it's made int italy and germany. in any case it's good
[2023-01-11 09:26:03] <JumpinJackson> not like vomit, but it does have an aftertaste. I'm mostly talking about Hershyes
[2023-01-11 09:26:06] <%Aldizzert> There are plenty of good microbrew chocolates in the US.
[2023-01-11 09:26:06] <%+rabidtqm> american kinder tastes nasty compared to european kinder

[2023-01-11 09:26:10] <%DeriumEnvy> American chocolate tastes like vomit because it has butyric acid, which is found in vomit.
[2023-01-11 09:26:14] <%+Tristan_Compton> people with grade school taste buds have the biggest opinions on food

[2023-01-11 09:26:33] <huntermarchildon> hersheys tastes vomity
[2023-01-11 09:26:35] <%Aldizzert> Butyric acid is also found in Butter. Hence its name.
[2023-01-11 09:26:36] <%+Tristan_Compton> @scobunk if you really believe that I wanna see you eat some  vomit
[2023-01-11 09:26:37] <%+quail_says_hi> i like the thought that the internet is kinda like the sum of all human knowledge.. and idiocy of course

[2023-01-11 09:26:48] <%+rabidtqm> the reason is they use butyric acid to give a fake butteryness. The same thing that makes nacho cheese taste like puke

[2023-01-11 10:13:00] <Flupperich> @tPredu "Half damage" is misleading because of the way armor works, on enemies too- Like pre-hardmode enemies have barely any armor, so for example 100 gets reduced to 50. Now enemies have armor, lets throw 50 armor as a made up number. That 100 damage is now 1 damage, because it gets halfed and THEN gets armor substracted.

[2023-01-11 10:29:34] <%tw1stf> you don't want to be moving around too much when farming mobs, stay still and let them come to you
[2023-01-11 10:29:35] <%+quail_says_hi> as well as a chance for ice mimics that can drop useful weapons
[2023-01-11 10:30:13] <%+quail_says_hi> you need those floating things that ice enemies drop btw

[2023-01-11 10:41:47] <stellar_star_fall> @frenc_hfr_y right click was the original way of applying the "target" but you can still rightclick
[2023-01-11 10:42:18] <stellar_star_fall> @frenc_hfr_y also right click lts you target enemies from through walls/without being in whip range so if you need to target something specific its still useful
[2023-01-11 10:42:36] <%+quail_says_hi> Honestly it would be really good to kill the clam, because if you do you can get access to a weapon called the Prismalline. Its an upgrade to a weapon called the Crystalline you were using at the beginning of your playthrough

[2023-01-11 11:13:21] <%Bin_Liftin> im digging the palladium
[2023-01-11 11:13:27] <92ndBearCavalry> @scobunk he should anyway, he needs every advantage he can get
[2023-01-11 11:13:28] <stellar_star_fall> @X2Creosote calamity changes the ore progression
[2023-01-11 11:13:39] <%X2Creosote> it changes so he cant use T3
[2023-01-11 11:13:42] <TaIanvor> @X2Creosote that doesnt work in calamity, no?

[2023-01-11 11:13:46] <%+Nootrishus> @DunkOrSlam go get your cobalt/paladium armour first. Thhen you should really work on getting Terraspark boots, ankh shield and the cell phone
[2023-01-11 11:13:46] <%X2Creosote> T3 doesnt spawn

[2023-01-11 11:13:55] <92ndBearCavalry> just one more try COPIUM
[2023-01-11 11:13:55] <ArthurAshford> one shot
[2023-01-11 11:13:57] <stellar_star_fall> @X2Creosote he has to kill a mech to spawn in t2 ores
[2023-01-11 11:13:58] <%salticibread> Calamity changed when early hardmode ores spawn unless you disabled that in config
[2023-01-11 11:14:02] <Flupperich> @Bubonic_MCCC Not in remade Calamity progression. It spawns each tier of HM ores after killing Wall of Flesh, 1, 2 and 3 Mech bosses. 3 Mech bosses technically spawns Hallowed Ore which isn't in Vanilla though.
[2023-01-11 11:14:04] <%th1cc_alpaca> @DunkOrSlam It's important that you try to get the ice out right away if you can't do it. If the ice has stuck to the skin or frozen in the anus, it can cause serious damage.
[2023-01-11 11:14:07] <%Its_All_Gone_Wrong> "You gotta believe!" "No bets!"
[2023-01-11 11:14:19] <%Bubonic_MCCC> @Flupperich aaah right
[2023-01-11 11:14:20] <%+quail_says_hi> @Bubonic_MCCC id actually say the palladium armor is better than the later armors of that tier lowkey because the setbonus is THAT good, especially if youu cant dodge very well
[2023-01-11 11:14:31] <%+quail_says_hi> you can use the palladium armor through all 3 mech bosses honestly
[2023-01-11 11:14:32] <%X2Creosote> he can use orichalcum, but no adamantine or titanium

[2023-01-11 11:18:05] <%th1cc_alpaca> @DunkOrSlam  If you are unable to remove the ice on your own or if you are in severe pain, it is important to seek medical attention immediately. It is not safe to leave ice in the anus and medical treatment may be necessary to correct the problem. <3 dnkLove dnkLove
[2023-01-11 11:18:05] <92ndBearCavalry> @Notaker9 It's definitely a game that benefits form having a wiki open

[2023-01-11 11:19:35] <%salticibread> After playing for 9 years it isn't too hard to not die in pre-hardmode but it's still annoying to get back to hardmode every time a hardcore run ends
