[2022-12-19 13:07:25] <%LSDuke> @rdulive that's how some sports do it, like hockey playoffs go until someone scores. some games have had 7 OTs, it's epic

Humbleness, respectfulness, dignity, etc.. You can't legitimise the missing of these with the status of the actual world.

[2022-12-19 15:02:35] <jayzororck> losing is part of the game. tank your score too like 3k and then feel like a god once again. thats how Kripp plays lol
[2022-12-19 15:02:35] <@%R2DU> HmmmG Kripp is only 7k mmr but he is far ahead of Rdu in critical thinking and analyzing the playing field, Kripp is always 5 steps ahead and is allready considering what minions to buy in tavern tier 6 while only at turn 2. wheras Rdu is only looking at the battlefield in front of him. i firmly believe Rdu should leave his bg carreer and focus on his cooking.
