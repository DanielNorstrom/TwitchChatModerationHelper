[2022-12-26 18:44:15] <%REAPERTEARS01> its really stupid imo
[2022-12-26 18:44:21] <%polig> yeah but you want smartest ppl on hardest professions, dont want to waste expensive education on a dum dum
[2022-12-26 18:44:57] <%REAPERTEARS01> @polig but grades dont mean that ur super smart either
[2022-12-26 18:45:06] <%REAPERTEARS01> u can be "bad" at school but still be smart
[2022-12-26 18:45:14] <%polig> no it doesnt, just a good guideline
[2022-12-26 18:45:20] <%REAPERTEARS01> true
[2022-12-26 18:45:40] <%polig> im not saying gatekeep all by grades just those super hard like medics and etc

[2022-12-26 18:46:24] <%Renektolijus> I honestly never studied in highschool for example KEKW
[2022-12-26 18:46:33] <%REAPERTEARS01> i never studied either i dont have matura KEKW
[2022-12-26 18:46:39] <%polig> grades shows dedication and ability to learn and maintain it, quick test or 2 might show how smart you are but you might still drop out after 1 year
[2022-12-26 18:47:23] <%polig> grades show you are a person who can maintain high level of education which is needed in these long term learning professions like medical stuff and etc

[2022-12-26 18:48:31] <%Renektolijus> well, you can always retake the exams
[2022-12-26 18:48:37] <%polig> idk i dont rly think its more about smart or dum, its more about personality and ability to learn, personally i think you can be stupid with university degree and smart without one, degree doesnt make you smart

[2022-12-26 19:19:33] <%polig> the same reason why it would fail is lets say the reason why public companies dont do well overall, you have very little for them to improve, no drive what so ever and they slowly degrade, if you do same for basic income you would have sht show sooner or later

[2022-12-26 19:23:24] <%alex__gfy> @Baker this is wild, but because of the military...I was able to go to school full time because the navy paid a housing allowance of 2500 a month on top of covering my tuition....if it wassnt for that id have been homeless or living with my parents

[2022-12-26 19:24:20] <%SyzzAMV> the US sucks on almost everything in current state if im being honest- I want to move pretty bad
[2022-12-26 19:24:35] <%alex__gfy> it was 2500 because i was living in los angeles while i went to school, so 2500 was scraping by
[2022-12-26 19:24:50] <%polig> but i dont like the fact they sort of try poorer ppl to sign off their life for education in USA
[2022-12-26 19:24:51] <%alex__gfy> @SyzzAMV same, id rather be in europe or canada

[2022-12-26 20:16:32] <%+Hi_Im_JJ> It's just annoying that people always say "Sorc is the best class in the game" and completely ignoring the reasons why
[2022-12-26 20:16:32] <@%^Streamlabs> because it's the best.
[2022-12-26 20:16:52] <%polig> because its easy
[2022-12-26 20:16:55] <%polig> that is why
[2022-12-26 20:16:55] <@%^Streamlabs> because it's the best.
[2022-12-26 20:17:07] <%polig> easy to outdps other while putting minimum effort
[2022-12-26 20:17:20] <+kleinaz> @polig have you played one?
[2022-12-26 20:17:40] <%polig> hitmaster
[2022-12-26 20:17:41] <%polig> simple
[2022-12-26 20:17:41] <%+Hi_Im_JJ> Yeah because the game is designed around burst windows. This is why all the burst classes are the "Best" classes
[2022-12-26 20:17:41] <@%^Streamlabs> because it's the best.
[2022-12-26 20:17:47] <%polig> dont need anything else :D
[2022-12-26 20:17:57] <%polig> you hitmaster class you are on 50% of easiest classes
[2022-12-26 20:18:19] <%+Arwya0203> hitmaster is easier for prog
[2022-12-26 20:18:21] <%polig> yeah but i think that is why ppl are bothered by sorc dps
[2022-12-26 20:18:21] <@%^Streamlabs> because it's the best.
[2022-12-26 20:18:21] <%Jimotthy> alaric PepeLa
[2022-12-26 20:18:23] <%+necxar> So which raid are you skipping now?
[2022-12-26 20:18:29] VIEWERS: 568
[2022-12-26 20:18:30] <%+Arwya0203> usually back attacker classes are better for farm/content you know
[2022-12-26 20:18:39] <%polig> if reaper would be most dps ppl wouldnt care because you need SC2 pro to play it that well
[2022-12-26 20:19:18] <%+Hi_Im_JJ> Yeah but I was saying a perfect" reflux and a "perfect" igniter aren't that far off and that's not incorrect. People have tested this in Trixion. But Igniter is the best because stuff like stagger checks, counters, dark grenades, spec bards etc. exist.
[2022-12-26 20:19:42] <%polig> 2 ppl were total birck on our brel g6 and both ppl mvp dps on easy gates and both had to be jailed other like hell
[2022-12-26 20:19:46] <%polig> cant be that hard to play sorc
[2022-12-26 20:20:29] VIEWERS: 568
[2022-12-26 20:20:41] <%Kristolicious> I mean look at saint, top player who does infernos and shit, he said sorc is less than optimal in the hardest content there is, that from that want you want.
[2022-12-26 20:20:49] <%+Hi_Im_JJ> DPS between an ancient Reflux and Ancient Igniter, last time I looked, was like 2% lol
[2022-12-26 20:21:04] <%+Hi_Im_JJ> It's just easier to do that damage with Igniter so why not play igniter
[2022-12-26 20:21:04] <@%^Streamlabs> because it's the best.
[2022-12-26 20:21:16] <%+Hi_Im_JJ> That streamlabs thing xdd
[2022-12-26 20:21:20] <%+fabs1983> Most of prefare igniter in groups just cause of the burst to skip things
[2022-12-26 20:21:36] <%polig> ppl dont play what does most dps at least most
[2022-12-26 20:21:46] <%polig> ppl should play what they like xD
[2022-12-26 20:21:52] <%+Niki_xyOn> hi baker, frohe weihnachten
[2022-12-26 20:22:07] <%+Hi_Im_JJ> @polig Yeah they do TBH
[2022-12-26 20:22:16] <%+Hi_Im_JJ> This is why sorc and db are the most popular classes
[2022-12-26 20:22:16] <@%^Streamlabs> because it's the best.

[2022-12-26 20:22:34] <%+FireZky> if u should change piano reflux u maybe would enjoy more
[2022-12-26 20:22:37] <%+FireZky> i do atleast
[2022-12-26 20:22:41] <%+Tetris_Kappa> igniter in a perfect scenario deals like 2.5x more dmg
[2022-12-26 20:22:43] <%+Hi_Im_JJ> Yeah idgaf about DPS, I main Scouter xdding
[2022-12-26 20:23:56] <%+Hi_Im_JJ> Well reflux is sustained DPS and igniter is burst. Over long windows, it evens out.
[2022-12-26 20:23:56] <%+Hi_Im_JJ> Yeah exactly
[2022-12-26 20:23:56] <%alex__gfy> can we all agree that transformation shadowhunter is the most boring class?
[2022-12-26 20:23:57] <%Kristolicious> holdup, igniter does NOT double reflux over a fight in a perfect scenario, for the igniter window perhaps, but not over a fight
[2022-12-26 20:24:01] <%polig> if i come to a raid with my lvl 10 gems on 1445 alt and i see a solid somewhat near my ilvl sorc and i can already know most likely i can be outdpsed, there is a problem there :D
[2022-12-26 20:24:04] <%+Hi_Im_JJ> The builds are like identical damage-wise but the design of the game means that Igniter is gonna perform better
[2022-12-26 20:24:25] <RapDuck> just type it like this 2x FPPD

[2022-12-26 20:27:14] <RapDuck> u just stand there and pump
[2022-12-26 20:27:36] <%Jimotthy> i prefer striker on bird than turtle, you already have so little mobility and when you pug or mm these Dentge s never drag the ice orb away
[2022-12-26 20:27:51] <%polig> oh come on i did him with crit/spec neck not even swift and didnt think that
[2022-12-26 20:28:33] <%+Hi_Im_JJ> I really like the bosses that fight back TBH. Trixion dummy turtle gets so boring
