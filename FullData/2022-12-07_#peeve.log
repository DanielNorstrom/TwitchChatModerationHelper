[2022-12-07 15:11:54] <$imLunchy> how did the ash summons pvp work out?
[2022-12-07 15:12:03] <%Outcastedbird> @gnodgib187 it serves it's purpose
[2022-12-07 15:12:17] <$imLunchy> ahh
[2022-12-07 15:12:25] <%+Krimson_0> Mimic tear seemed significantly more tanky than the other ashes
[2022-12-07 15:12:30] <%+Krimson_0> but it got pretty crazy at 120
[2022-12-07 15:12:38] <Gnodgib187> @Outcastedbird sure thing :)
[2022-12-07 15:12:40] <Gnodgib187> are there any rewards for pvping in the arenas?
[2022-12-07 15:12:40] <%$HiryuuNoShi> so the ash summons are super Nerf

[2022-12-07 15:13:19] <%+FutaSnek> I've been using the sleep arrow puppet summon LUL
[2022-12-07 15:13:19] <%SleepySlee> Yeah I think people are overestimating how strong summons are against players
[2022-12-07 15:13:26] <Gennousake_> suppose*
[2022-12-07 15:13:27] <KissMyAceM8> really hope mimic tear isnt going to be the best one, but it probably will be. It takes all the fun out of it
[2022-12-07 15:13:34] <7c_nickel> hawk is bad vs casters, it dodges melee

[2022-12-07 15:13:45] <%$HiryuuNoShi> @reload46 I think the health pools are just super reduced for the summons
[2022-12-07 15:13:45] <ozzy_osvi> How about the little shield dudes, are they any good in these?
[2022-12-07 15:13:47] <%+FutaSnek> Plus there's the healer puppet, so she can keep ya going

[2022-12-07 15:14:06] <+eburic> summoning mimic tear hurts you tho so either heal or have less hp
[2022-12-07 15:14:06] <%$HiryuuNoShi> but you still need the stats to use the items you switching to
[2022-12-07 15:14:10] <%thunderrex> they might of under tuned them just in case, and that can be patched

[2022-12-07 15:14:37] <Sir_Varg> Lhutel has the sneaky teleport and can inflict death blight and was the manliest summon
[2022-12-07 15:14:38] <%SchmickSchmackins> That's kinda annoying but I guess that's cool the first time you play
[2022-12-07 15:14:43] <reload46> @HiryuuNoShi the hp are fine for summons its just oro and peeve just deal absurd damage in their levels
[2022-12-07 15:14:44] <%Outcastedbird> since you bounce off the Great shields if you one hand your weapon
[2022-12-07 15:14:46] <Hardtime_gingerlife> How is levels balanced in this?

[2022-12-07 15:43:51] <%Outcastedbird> Making a Meta level for ER was a joke tbh. You can be 120 for duels at Raya Lucaria, but you literally could find duels at any level anyway and everyone is overpowered no matter what after level 70

[2022-12-07 15:50:18] <%papaPathos> I am convinced the game sense that peeve is harboring resentment for oro's picky eating habits

[2022-12-07 15:52:07] <kingwabbithole1> If you are loading solo it is easy to find matches. If you have multiple people you’re trying to play with, you have to load with your teammates first before you load any enemies. If you load any enemies before you have your full team, cancel matchmaking and try again
[2022-12-07 15:52:10] <%$HiryuuNoShi> I want to know what the password is now

[2022-12-07 15:53:08] <%Outcastedbird> What is going on with the Players Choice award btw? Folks saying the Sonic and Genshin votes are inflated because bot votes from the Genshin community and a big that doesn't allow folk to choose Elden Ring, GOW, or Stray?
[2022-12-07 15:53:20] <%Outcastedbird> *a bug
[2022-12-07 15:53:22] <ElPapaMike> @Outcastedbird That is true

[2022-12-07 15:53:36] <%Outcastedbird> well fuck
[2022-12-07 15:53:45] <%$HiryuuNoShi> maybe that last match was a fluke
[2022-12-07 15:53:57] <ElPapaMike> Saw a video on someone trying to select ER as their game choice but it was not letting them choose it but when they clicked on Sonic it accepted the vote
[2022-12-07 15:54:06] [Notification] Liil_lily subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 15 months! [fuck obobo  now peeve  is my new  friendo]
[2022-12-07 15:54:06] <Gennousake_> peeve you got a foe now
[2022-12-07 15:54:07] <ClaymoreJesus> It's actually the Sonic fans who were botting because they were losing to Genshin KEKHeim
[2022-12-07 15:54:14] <st0ck1ng> is that a bug? those there games were nominated for fully fledged awards
[2022-12-07 15:54:38] <Nyanbro> @Outcastedbird In the end community vote isn't the end all be all right, there are still judges
[2022-12-07 15:54:40] <kingwabbithole1> Get your remaining allies to zero before you load any foes. If you load any foes before you have your full team, you will be stuck in matchmaking
[2022-12-07 15:54:46] <+dacheesdog> Has Peeve tried Caelid w/ summons?
[2022-12-07 15:54:56] <$Krox034> hows the pvp patch going? able to match with specified people as allies or no?
[2022-12-07 15:55:15] <terat0_o> i think the game is setting up both of you against eachother. LUL

[2022-12-07 15:55:57] <%Outcastedbird> @claymorejesus wait I saw a Genshin guy admitting to botting so if Genshin wins the community can get some of the in game currency
[2022-12-07 15:56:00] <%$HiryuuNoShi> I think that was just a pure fluke that last match
[2022-12-07 15:56:02] <%$BrotherHowe> I mean passwords have always ignored level brackets

[2022-12-07 15:56:28] <%Outcastedbird> I guess it's premium currency for that game they are hoping for?
[2022-12-07 15:56:38] <ClaymoreJesus> @Outcastedbird Iirc the botting was for the Sonic results. There may be a lot of "he said, she said" going on, but it's a clown fiesta nonetheless.

[2022-12-07 15:57:44] <+Firewynn> @dora_ffxiv I dont think duels have true scaling. I am 125 and the person i just fought was 270... I think its like DS2 where weapon level is more important the character level

[2022-12-07 16:03:39] <UnavailableLUL> spirit ashes need pvp buffs i think

[2022-12-07 16:03:49] <%thunderrex> they were +10 right?
[2022-12-07 16:03:52] <Astorabro> you can buff your spirit ashes with spells I suppose
[2022-12-07 16:03:56] <huntergansey> damn, might have to re up my ps plus then to actually try it out
[2022-12-07 16:03:56] <Kalameet3> @outcastedbird Nope, almost nobody expects it, that’s why I use the fire breath and roar to make it look like I’m using one of the three
[2022-12-07 16:04:12] <%$HiryuuNoShi> huh
[2022-12-07 16:04:30] <%thunderrex> @peeve your ashes +10 right?
[2022-12-07 16:04:44] <%Outcastedbird> @kalameet3 and it has a ton of Poise on it unlike the breaths so folks go for the poise break and just get annihilated

[2022-12-07 16:08:10] <st0ck1ng> @danimal8990 they did one or two and decided summons are bad not sure if they’re going back for more
[2022-12-07 16:08:16] <reload46> @psrieckhoff about 200 dmg
[2022-12-07 16:08:31] <+AcetoneEyeDrops> @Peeve base damage reduced by 30% scaling stayed the same it seems
[2022-12-07 16:08:33] <Tiny_Axolotl> what actually heals now?
[2022-12-07 16:08:33] <Astorabro> Carian slicer is still good, but you shouldn't just use that one spell on your mage
[2022-12-07 16:08:41] <+Madmagician86> Yo what are the fashion pieces?

[2022-12-07 16:08:53] <Bathezid> how much did they nerf flame of the redmanes?
[2022-12-07 16:08:53] <%Outcastedbird> yea it was nutty
[2022-12-07 16:09:03] <%BrandonGrave02> Did they finally nerf carian slicer?
[2022-12-07 16:09:07] <%$StryfeDragon> Carian Slicer needs a 50% fucking damage nerf. You cannot change my mind.
[2022-12-07 16:09:07] <+SpacemanSpraggz> there's 2 types of players. Players that die in 3 slicers, and players that die in 2 slicers
[2022-12-07 16:09:09] <%$StryfeDragon> 50%
[2022-12-07 16:09:11] <huntergansey> rip my sweet baby, may carian slicer rest in piece
[2022-12-07 16:09:17] <+allmightypumpal> but peeve slicer is a lightsabre. lightsabres should 1 shot
[2022-12-07 16:09:17] <huntergansey> peace

[2022-12-07 16:09:22] <+valterak9> I think they mostly just need to get rid of the multiplicative buff stacking and the crazy damage problem would basically go away LUL

[2022-12-07 16:09:44] <Amentur> @Bathezid Went from 40 down to 10 poise damage

[2022-12-07 16:11:16] <+valterak9> @outcastedbird no just make them additive instead of multiplicative, so instead of damage x1.15x1.25x1.3x1.2 it should just be damage x 1.85

[2022-12-07 18:06:05] <%WhitefoxBlack> They tried to make arenas, it just seems like they’ve finally realized what pvp actually is
[2022-12-07 18:06:18] <ImJustRoids> @nfgayle @gerry0002 last I knew they still only used servers for matchmaking itself, not the actual sessions once established.
[2022-12-07 18:06:23] <Khorne1977> @peeve Apologies if you had this chat earlier, but with this free update, do you reckon ER DLC will be announced at the Game Awards? COPIUM
[2022-12-07 18:06:26] <%+SinfireTitan> The summons one may be more fun at lower levels with everyone using a maxed Mimic.
