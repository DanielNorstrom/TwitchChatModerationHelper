[2022-12-17 17:42:05] <%+texaspoontappa99> Also be sure to eat lunch before, most people starve all day then get full quickly
[2022-12-17 17:42:09] <%$3volver> don't fill up on rice
[2022-12-17 17:42:09] <$zeehitz> @MarMar0326   eat as much as you can in the first 20 minutes.. after 20 mins or so, your brain will cut you off

[2022-12-17 17:42:22] <%FreshPrinceOfRockBand> kinda like when i went to a NY-style pizza joint, thinking i could probably eat a whole pie. i ended up buying 4 slices and got full af just off of those

[2022-12-17 17:43:03] <%Azur85> But we don't know that the yoshi is needed later
[2022-12-17 17:43:03] <$therealJedhigh> am I the only one who doesn't want barb to quit?
[2022-12-17 17:43:08] <$Newmatic> isn't holding the baby Yoshi what is allowing you to hit P speed or is that wrong?
[2022-12-17 17:43:09] <$zeehitz> yes
[2022-12-17 17:43:09] <TieRuMVP> maybe yoshi is just for eating those suns
[2022-12-17 17:43:09] <BlktoothGrN> Brazilian steakhouse is like filling a jar, if you dont chew enough it’s like putting rocks in the jar, and eventually you’ll run out of space, but if you chew well enough it’s like filling a jar with sand
[2022-12-17 17:43:10] <$Squee43> @tef_ebooks SMM2  perhaps?
[2022-12-17 17:43:12] <Shockingshields> these levels are all so unintuitive
[2022-12-17 17:43:12] <%sonavor> @sonavor oh yeah lol, I usually just accept that I will get full on meat and get a bunch of cheese and lobster bisque too

[2022-12-17 22:31:05] <%FreshPrinceOfRockBand> saying something is bad is pretty much interchangeable from saying you dislike it. it's just bad in your opinion
[2022-12-17 22:31:07] <+Aezak5> @Abduwu the thing is, from a design standpoint, the player should feel when they are doing something wrong
