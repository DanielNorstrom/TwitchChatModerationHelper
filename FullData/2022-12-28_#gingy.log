[2022-12-28 17:10:06] <%+ogjoker88> @Gingy  from the patch notes Reworked the sound mechanics  Steam Audio has been completely removed from the project and replaced with Oculus Audio. The sound positioning system changes will be noticeable regardless of the binaural sound setting, but we recommend enabling binaural audio for the best experience.

[2022-12-28 17:24:11] <%+ogjoker88> Reworked the sound mechanics  Steam Audio has been completely removed from the project and replaced with Oculus Audio. The sound positioning system changes will be noticeable regardless of the binaural sound setting, but we recommend enabling binaural audio for the best experience.
[2022-12-28 17:24:12] <+iperius89> is that a nuke?
[2022-12-28 17:24:13] <%pikapii010> did they add tanks to the game?
[2022-12-28 17:24:13] <@%I_Am_Geese> Not even close to me LUL

[2022-12-28 17:24:27] <alivedemon> is the new audio better ?
[2022-12-28 17:24:27] <+chaos_608> it's more realistic, guns and gernades are loud as fuck in real life
[2022-12-28 17:24:29] <+inKuppa> servers are back
[2022-12-28 17:24:30] <+scorps75> how much did u get done before server fires
[2022-12-28 17:24:30] <gc_monster7> The new sounds are fucked up
[2022-12-28 17:24:31] <%StoneValleyKing> thats what we noticed, and were asking about
[2022-12-28 17:24:31] <MMStream> They didnt list interchange as one of the "fixed" maps

[2022-12-28 17:24:48] <%+ogjoker88> she didnt read the patch notes lol
[2022-12-28 17:24:52] <SillyBonerino> ur noob for this extract
[2022-12-28 17:24:57] <%Gerberbaby4> I got out of mine and about to get back in to another gingy
[2022-12-28 17:25:05] <%Nykademus> Gotta be honest, on my end the sound is great. That's 3rd party though.
[2022-12-28 17:25:06] <%+tugghboat> do you have an affiliate for gamer advantage?
[2022-12-28 17:25:07] <+GrimReaverr> however the moving and combat is a bit better

[2022-12-28 17:25:28] <+ReK_42> If it was next to coop extract is think it's your scav rep, but that's safe room...
[2022-12-28 17:25:32] <+ItsAdyx> hope they did not introduced PMC karma
[2022-12-28 17:25:36] <+Shmoits> New sounds are wonderful. People just aren't used to it. Old sound was not representative of how sound works at all.
[2022-12-28 17:25:38] <tysoniner> New weapon and armor improvements from repairs
[2022-12-28 17:25:42] <tysoniner> 5 new guns

[2022-12-28 17:25:56] <%Nykademus> @GrimReaverr I once ate someone's lunch out of the work fridge and let someone else take the blame for it.
[2022-12-28 17:25:57] <%narsilbladee> whats the thing about pmc karma?
[2022-12-28 17:25:59] <%+ogjoker88> It has to do with charisma skill
[2022-12-28 17:26:00] <tysoniner> 5 new stims
[2022-12-28 17:26:06] <%+Vysterion> he likes you
[2022-12-28 17:26:07] <%+sfbandyman> He's waiting cause the game is down...
[2022-12-28 17:26:10] <+GinaLovesGaming> probably cause he knows servers are down...lol
[2022-12-28 17:26:15] <%+deosilic> Or he‚Äôs dead af
[2022-12-28 17:26:17] <+Shmoits> I got 4 PMC kills on my first raid. Bear's and USEC's. There was nothing about pmc karma in my endscreen results.
[2022-12-28 17:26:18] <+Ironlors_TTV> is EU down for anyone else?
[2022-12-28 17:26:21] <MMStream> You sure it's not someone further away
[2022-12-28 17:26:21] <+ReK_42> Oh yeah @gingy I bet the "LVL" is your charisma
[2022-12-28 17:26:23] <%+OR10N867> He can hear you when you open close your inventory LUL
[2022-12-28 17:26:27] <HyperHuman> good ol' escape from campers
[2022-12-28 17:26:27] <gc_monster7> He thinks the same thing LUL
[2022-12-28 17:26:30] <%Gerberbaby4> I made it out of a raid and into another gingy just sayin
[2022-12-28 17:26:31] <%nopeboats> i just had a 1:30 wait time for a raid lol
[2022-12-28 17:26:32] <%+ogjoker88> He might not be there and could just be sound
[2022-12-28 17:26:32] <TipicalTeddy> maybe Streets is the reason why....People having high RAM issues and freezing PC issues....They might just take out Streets for the meantime
[2022-12-28 17:26:33] <+inKuppa> servers are back

[2022-12-28 17:54:45] <DefianceOrDishonor> 32gb is what I recommend as well to people. It's not that expensive these days anyway.
[2022-12-28 17:54:45] <%$rednecrikky> no!!! i found a gpu!
[2022-12-28 17:54:49] <tusk_blue_> and now servers are too bad to reinstall

[2022-12-28 18:40:26] <%Nykademus> Tarkov always brings a hair tie on wipe day. So you know its going down at least once.
[2022-12-28 18:40:47] <%gc_monster7> Wait, the stomach doesn't get blacked out, why the coughing?
[2022-12-28 18:40:50] <%Buxbomber> @Boomstix225 whats the best way to learn the maps?

[2022-12-28 20:33:44] <+branchoffbush> i feel like for wipe day player scavs should be able to enter raids earlier
[2022-12-28 20:33:47] <epicshoo> is it normal for player scavs to shoot other player scavs this early or am i just unlucky?
[2022-12-28 20:34:01] <+xshdow7_> just waited 16 min for factory scav
[2022-12-28 20:34:12] <+CatieDearest> @epicshoo very common

[2022-12-28 22:43:11] <papadabz> So I got the game a few days ago but had to deal with pre-wipe events so haven't experienced the game the way it's supposed to be really. What should I be trying to do first? I don't want to lose all my guns and money and then be screwed.

[2022-12-28 22:45:43] <DetroXification> your levels will go with the reset tho, keep that in mind. But just putting on your best gear and just bruteforce the basics and then just reset to get them back is kinda how i introduce new players to tarkov :P

I really enjoy the game so far though and just want to get better.

[2022-12-28 23:04:53] <%+fatboismall> probs a memory leak or something
[2022-12-28 23:05:01] <$Rutgrr> its not your PC. its the game
[2022-12-28 23:05:03] <hascanianowl> I assume the memory leak fix didnt do much?
[2022-12-28 23:05:07] <treefing3r5> my whole group has been having awful fps today
[2022-12-28 23:05:07] <+HiddenGambit> there is a rumored mimory leak that does require restarting the game everyso often
[2022-12-28 23:05:08] <nLK420> probably just the game lol
[2022-12-28 23:05:08] <%+fatboismall> pest was saying the same thing after 3 games
[2022-12-28 23:05:09] <junglerice> they fixed the memory leak i thought
[2022-12-28 23:05:12] <nLK420> it's never the pc with tarkov
[2022-12-28 23:05:18] <%0x4ndy> nope, lots of frames on my instance
[2022-12-28 23:05:20] <+swaggy_sid> Landmark just restarted cuz of frames
