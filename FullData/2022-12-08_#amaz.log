[2022-12-08 17:08:28] <%$FiDuDemo> Hi Amaz , this is 4House ’s mom. I noticed you haven’t been picking my son for your team in gym class. 4House has been having a really tough time since his dad and I split up, and it doesn’t make it easy on him when you reroll and say, "We’re never taking 4House ". I think you should take a hard look at yourself in the mirror and think how it would feel if someone said that about you. Imagine how much you could have done with that 50g. Why don’t you try being a bit more inclusive?

[2022-12-08 17:08:40] <%+mrneverstopp> Hi Amaz , this is 4House ’s mom. I noticed you haven’t been picking my son for your team in gym class. 4House has been having a really tough time since his dad and I split up, and it doesn’t make it easy on him when you reroll and say, "We’re never taking 4House ". I think you should take a hard look at yourself in the mirror and think how it would feel if someone said that about you. Imagine how much you could have done with that 50g. Why don’t you try being a bit more inclusive?
[2022-12-08 17:08:41] <%+twisterm22> that is actually true but you never get serious

[2022-12-08 18:47:54] <wintomepls> Madge battlerite royale
[2022-12-08 18:47:54] <+TheMightyTofu> Gameplay wise, no. It's so solid. The devs just made bad decisions, playerbase dwindled, then they abandoned it and recycled all of its assets into V Rising.
