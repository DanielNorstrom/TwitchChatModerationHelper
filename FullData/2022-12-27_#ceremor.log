[2022-12-27 19:03:29] <%+muffdiver69420> there's a modded server on Squad that focuses on team play and squad collaboration, and it basically makes it soyou can't see anyone on the map besides your squad and your SL can only see other SLs. i think it's a fair idea for Battlebit, especially with a hardcore dynamic added @Ceremor

[2022-12-27 22:21:12] <Rapsterblue> i thin its because theve decresed the range zombies can be close to you while attacking
[2022-12-27 22:21:17] <%+MaXimuX_777> such a great concept of having free playtests before releasing it
[2022-12-27 22:21:20] <averageppguy> thanks buddy

[2022-12-27 22:22:32] <%+7hirdeye> Do you think dark and darker would work with more wide open spaces in some spots? @ceremor
[2022-12-27 22:22:34] <Berlin_AE> looked like they were more testing the class balance then map variety

[2022-12-27 22:25:24] <LawyerMD> @Rapsterblue You said the Norwegian word for "agreed", and the guy for some reason thought you said something else, something not allowed to say
[2022-12-27 22:25:39] <@%SetPhaserstoPun> i also want there to be a debuff for when you didnt wear clothes for the movement speed, like you take more damage on uncovered parts because movement speed is like EVERYTHING in a melee game
