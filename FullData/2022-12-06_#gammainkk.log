[2022-12-06 11:13:13] <%shypotatoboy> Cheer100 so it was my second job, Walmart. I was the cart pusher, so I didn‚Äôt really have to deal with customers and I could work outside. Ideal for someone like me who doesn‚Äôt like people and can‚Äôt stay put. Anyway, as cart pusher I was also responsible for maintenance of the store and restrooms. One time, I walk into the men‚Äôs restroom and I see a lot of brown stuff in the sink. Praying it was chili, I walk over and take a minor wiff. Safe to say, it wasn‚Äôt chili‚Ä¶ And I had to clean it.
