[2023-01-07 21:09:22] <%$kernymi> iirc lost judgement is also on steam
[2023-01-07 21:09:26] <%$kernymi> was ported recently i think
[2023-01-07 21:09:34] <%Keld__> I think im gonna try to beat elden ring then maybe judgement
[2023-01-07 21:09:38] <+y0uwantmi> Lost judgments story is insane
[2023-01-07 21:09:43] <CrazyPizzaDiamond> judgment has a "spam 1 button and do cool shit" difficulty
[2023-01-07 21:09:47] <%Keld__> but elden ring im playing around with more than actually trying to beat
[2023-01-07 21:09:51] <@%Laww__> i still havent looked at judgement in case u play it KEKW
[2023-01-07 21:10:21] <%spellsword91> Just starting Elden Ring myself helps to know what build you want your character to be before going in I feel
[2023-01-07 21:10:32] <+y0uwantmi> its quite different perspective than yakuza
