You will need to claim your first drop before you can earn progress towards the next. You will be notified in chat and your notifications feed when you're able to claim. You can find your inventory and progress at twitch.tv/drops

[2022-12-08 01:47:00] <+ianJNL> @probablyNotASpider With JQ down the fight is basically lost, she might as well just go for it, if it works it works and if she dies it's a reset. Good play by her actually

[2022-12-08 01:52:44] <Audgeirr> her shout needs to be 7 second cooldown
[2022-12-08 01:52:52] <+ianJNL> He didn't need to go from 600 -> 700
[2022-12-08 01:52:55] <+ianJNL> 600 is plenty
[2022-12-08 01:53:05] <+Leandir> Mercy has 5 bullets extra so Hog needs his survivability still. That's an indirect nerf to Hog tbh
[2022-12-08 01:53:07] <%LynnDingo> @ianjnl facts
[2022-12-08 01:53:08] <Wombat_107_> @ianJNL agreed
[2022-12-08 01:53:11] <%$jkmore96> Maybe hog should have less health cause 700hp plus his heal is too much
[2022-12-08 01:53:14] <xxgriffin20x> @noahabd you have to login on a browser and claim. For some reason it’s not working on mobile

[2022-12-08 02:41:15] <MeepingMeep> But it is the worst mode. Multiple top 500s had made that claim.
[2022-12-08 02:41:25] <fourthwright> push is a terrible game mode.

[2022-12-08 02:41:48] <%$Biangle> @kasper93 no like, mathematically it's imbalanced. You can win the same # of fights as the enemy and only bring your progress back to neutral because of how it works

[2022-12-08 02:43:08] <%$Biangle> if you push the payload a certain distance, the enemy has to match it to win. If you push the robot nearly to the end, the enemy has to double that effort to win.

[2022-12-08 15:27:25] <%+mirel1983> Need survability + more options for heroes. You need x2 support and x2 DPS but DPS has like x3 more DPS heroes
[2022-12-08 15:27:28] <swiftiewanda> yes!
[2022-12-08 15:27:29] <%dankpips45> Will you or flats be playing more Doom in comp now? @Emongg

[2022-12-08 15:28:19] <%+mirel1983> Personally I think the way to solve the queues is have x1 tank, x3 DPS and x1 support

[2022-12-08 15:29:03] <hamisfruit> Anyone else not getting drops?
[2022-12-08 15:29:05] <JayTHM> MoreEmongg when?
[2022-12-08 15:29:19] <Absnerdity> Support are already having a TERRIBLE time, having one less support would be AWFUL
[2022-12-08 15:29:28] <%+mirel1983> DPS queues longer by adding +1 DPS? dunno really?
[2022-12-08 15:29:29] <The_SuItan> 1 tank 1 dps 3 support

[2022-12-08 15:29:30] <+sierramarlee> You'd have to gigabuff support and make them healbots

[2022-12-08 15:29:39] <%+mirel1983> I get the x1 support would be targetted a lot more
[2022-12-08 15:29:40] <teteus_> wow that dude kills fast
[2022-12-08 15:29:45] <+sierramarlee> that would take the fun out of the role
[2022-12-08 15:29:51] <synumsucks> Why can't we have 5 DPS?
[2022-12-08 15:29:54] <JayTHM> 5 support
[2022-12-08 15:29:54] <hamisfruit> They should make a tank support, gigachad support.
[2022-12-08 15:29:56] <+Shogun_Nando85> have you gotten to try the new map yet?
[2022-12-08 15:29:58] <+Deno1100> it feels like support is exactly where blizz wants us, no cc, no survivability, its fun for the dps and tanks, and we just heal a bit to make the fights not insta wipes. support role is counter to this teams game design philosophy.

[2022-12-08 15:30:28] <%dankpips45> Would a passive for faster  movement (like dps had) for every 150 or 200 hp damaged or healed be a good buff for supports?

[2022-12-08 15:36:23] <%dankpips45> I think a big problem with buffing supports was how painful moth meta and early brig was. Supports have too much influence on team fights to be OP.

[2022-12-08 15:38:51] <miDnight_SC2> @manic_eeyore they already have a new ult just missing the graphics and VFX
[2022-12-08 15:38:54] <JayTHM> yeah you're right
[2022-12-08 15:38:54] <ChristianSharkTV> They already suggested they were gonna rework Brig to have a new ult. Maybe making a nerfed version of her Rally as a normal ability like Mercy got with Rez? @Emongg
[2022-12-08 15:38:54] <Ditis_Patris> Hey Emongg. What if they had dual roles, you could pick a character as a dps or a support?
[2022-12-08 15:38:56] <%zonar_ow> i unironically liked when sombra was played as a support
[2022-12-08 15:38:56] <reagan__> do they still put stuff into the test server?

[2022-12-08 15:39:05] <+aaymon86> I think the only supports that need buffs/reworks are Ana, Brig, Mercy and Zen
[2022-12-08 15:39:05] <crazy__ape> Do you think junk or Queens buffs are not substantial enough
[2022-12-08 15:39:06] <insertmemehere69> at least do an experiment card for them to try crazy support stuff

[2022-12-08 15:39:07] <1sbear> zen need rework, i personally think hes heal is weakest among all support

[2022-12-08 15:42:50] <%WolfIsBad_> the only thing I would change on sigma is lower the damage of his rock just a little
[2022-12-08 15:42:51] <%+eman_ggs> I feel like Sigma could use a counter to Mai, but other than that I agree
[2022-12-08 15:42:53] <gunsmith147> it takes skill to play sigma, he feels insane when paired with the right team
[2022-12-08 15:42:53] <%Fair0h> The biggest problem I have with Sigma is I sometimes dont hit people with my balls

[2022-12-08 15:47:48] <1sbear> the position gave me ocd attack
[2022-12-08 15:47:50] <%+eman_ggs> I think the biggest issue with OW2 rn is the skin prices. As a new player I laugh at the idea of paying $20 for a single skin. At $5 I may be tempted, but it's pretty egregious pricing

[2022-12-08 15:51:02] <%+eman_ggs> facts, coming from Apex it's really bad in OW in comparison
[2022-12-08 15:51:27] <%zonar_ow> yes
[2022-12-08 15:51:34] <BasicallyStreamer> Why did they get rid off Versus screen before comp games, it was looking so nice, it was very satysfing to finally see higher ranks than yours meaning that you are close to ranking up.
[2022-12-08 15:51:35] <OfficialBuddah> i want the old SR ranking system, i thought that was better than what is now,
[2022-12-08 15:51:36] <Apollmao77> yea valorant and apex have that

[2022-12-08 15:52:18] <%+eman_ggs> yeah, in apex it has a point value that you need to hit. you also know that there is a point "entry fee" per game and you get points for kills and placement

[2022-12-08 16:21:23] <dkanimate> instead of pulling heros to the ground, the vortex should slow and prevent jumping

[2022-12-08 16:24:48] <+phalex_turner> If JQ was buffed to her beta level, would she still be so powerful given kiriko is in the game?
[2022-12-08 16:24:50] <%$Curlycross> @WolfIsBad_ no some people went up. Basically whatever rank you were showing they counted all the games you had after the update. So if you got 7 wins and shows Master 5, and then played 4 games after and won 1 and lost 3, you got what your rank was after those 4 matches
[2022-12-08 16:24:51] <%Nonstantine> @lady_boyyy correct. and comp is a mess rn. I was placed against masters player last night with bronzes on my team. feels even worse than s1

[2022-12-08 16:36:38] <waveybubbadon> The skin and spray don’t pop up in drops for me and I’m on iOS
[2022-12-08 16:36:39] <+Porkchop_4> Zarya hard counters Ramatra
[2022-12-08 16:36:43] <%+kyr0n_z> Staff go brrrrr
[2022-12-08 16:36:45] <+TrippingCat> Is that a bug

[2022-12-08 16:36:52] <%$weepychiefff> What do you think could make Ram stronger?
[2022-12-08 16:36:53] <Cetra> since bubble surrounds zarya, does it take double pummel damage when it goes through, bubble, zarya, bubble on the way out? monkaHmm
[2022-12-08 16:36:55] <%+wisteria_rose> @waveybubbadon On iOS the drops progress isn’t showing but its working – you can check & claim on a web browser emongEZ
[2022-12-08 16:36:58] <+phe0nixf0rce> First somewhat balanced character to be added
[2022-12-08 16:37:01] <jackhalk32> The staff feels a little weak imo
[2022-12-08 16:37:06] <xUndyingReaperx> ok, pop off "king"
[2022-12-08 16:37:06] <waveybubbadon> Ok
[2022-12-08 16:37:12] <+sfgator> Does his ult feed Zaraya bubbles or will it just not hit her while she bubbles?
[2022-12-08 16:37:13] <Boricuadevida> His ult is strong tho
[2022-12-08 16:37:13] <%solgr> @weepychiefff IMO a shield that doesn't deter after a set period of time
[2022-12-08 16:37:14] <+bishbash5> maybe if the staff had piercing? @jackhalk32
[2022-12-08 16:37:15] <arywants> Does he block zarya?
[2022-12-08 16:37:19] <wh_jormungandr> i feel his entire kit is OP besides his E (not tall enough) and his transofrmed punch (not far enough)
[2022-12-08 16:37:19] <Animeoutkast02> Just use his other mode
[2022-12-08 16:37:26] <%solgr> @sfgator it does
[2022-12-08 16:37:27] <comfyshane> sojourn is still OP
[2022-12-08 16:37:29] <hobrev> good way to go about it
[2022-12-08 16:37:31] <bUDGETbOTofficial> ok, pop off "king"

[2022-12-08 16:37:45] <%zonar_ow> probably had him strong, but didn't want people saying pay to win, so they flexed to doom being the strong hero
[2022-12-08 16:37:46] <%+jonah_ward> they want to avoid the pay to win comments as much as possible
[2022-12-08 16:37:46] <+bishbash5> they haven't fixed their team shots
[2022-12-08 16:37:48] <Elidest> Do u think he should have a lil more health? or maybe his omnic from gets shields?
[2022-12-08 16:37:49] <spacedragoniii> i think they buffed doom to much
[2022-12-08 16:37:49] <%solgr> @wh_jormungandr how is his shield OP, IMO his weakest part of kit

[2022-12-08 16:38:07] <Whiskhot> Tank queues are almready very long. Adding a very strong TheVixenValkyrie ank would have made things even much worse...
[2022-12-08 16:38:07] <+sfgator> @solgr Thanks
[2022-12-08 16:38:08] <letswoolgather> ram will get more buffs than support if nothing else
[2022-12-08 16:38:11] <%+ThighsOrGoodBye> @spacedragoniii you're wrong
[2022-12-08 16:38:13] <+The_Zmiley> the developers do have power over balancing, they dont have power over monetizing, maybe its their way to show support against borderline p2w heroes
[2022-12-08 16:38:13] <hobrev> how much health does the shield have?
[2022-12-08 16:38:14] VIEWERS: 4 202
[2022-12-08 16:38:16] <+N0V0w3ls> it seems like maybe they wanted Nemesis form to be a kind of brawl form that commits more than other tanks, but then didn't make it powerful enough to do that
[2022-12-08 16:38:18] <TrrueBacca> I miss Brig slingshot jump KEKW
[2022-12-08 16:38:19] <%MattyTheBoi> So is JQ tho tbf
[2022-12-08 16:38:24] <biignasty408> wjen he transforms give him like a health boost since hes tank
[2022-12-08 16:38:24] <wh_jormungandr> @solgr yeah i suppose i can see that. the timer is the only part that weakens it but i get your point.

[2022-12-08 16:40:38] <ChefBoyAZ> bastion ult still ult trash

[2022-12-08 16:40:40] <@%zambam5> bastion's ult was real good when it was bugged tho!
[2022-12-08 16:40:43] <biginvestments> IMO Bastion doesn't need an ult
[2022-12-08 16:40:47] <+jwalker1311> i hate how abilities are now becoming similar. Rama's block vs doom block, rama's vortex vs sojourn vortex - very valorant
[2022-12-08 16:40:47] <redkirbomomento> @eman_ggs yeah because he counters most tanks
[2022-12-08 16:40:50] <+Link_NWK> Definitely see more bastion now

[2022-12-08 16:41:00] <comfyshane> give back the OW1 bastion ult
[2022-12-08 16:41:00] <%faultysaeg> I get buffing the ult but I hate Reconfigure.
[2022-12-08 16:41:01] <handeee462> In my ranks Torb is a really good pick
[2022-12-08 16:41:08] <bUDGETbOTofficial> i meant that not many people play him, usually seeing pharah or soldiers
[2022-12-08 16:41:08] <FireLordKalglo> how do you buff vortex though? can't really increase the slow cos goes against low cc OW2: is it just increasing damage/ range? or how about having like a 0.75 second lock where players inside can't escape etc
[2022-12-08 16:41:08] <+Mike2621> People complaining about bastion have got to be new to the game right

[2022-12-08 16:41:17] <Cetra> do you know if Ram's pummel hits round shields twice? like winston/zarya bubbles?
[2022-12-08 16:41:17] <dkanimate> instead of pulling heros to the ground, the vortex should slow and prevent jumping

[2022-12-08 17:07:23] <bowjack66> @emongg what is the true essence of being an tank? is it taking any damage or opening the way for your teammate to kidnap the squishy? because i take a lots of blame if my MIT is below 7k even tho i got 23-7
[2022-12-08 17:07:29] <tigolbiddy6> @Detektt Seems op til u try to 1v1 a roadhog lol

[2022-12-08 17:07:39] <+Myathe> Ramattra can be good if you have a healer pocketing you
[2022-12-08 17:07:40] <+Shogun_Nando85> why does everyone like tank so much?
[2022-12-08 17:07:45] <Lebby710> He’s definitely counterable
[2022-12-08 17:07:46] <TooManySnipers> @emongg will you play him in ranked when he's unlocked
[2022-12-08 17:07:46] <biginvestments> @drewmanjii_ same as his shift with AOE damage as well
[2022-12-08 17:07:47] <+Myathe> but he's not OP

[2022-12-08 17:07:52] <%RhettOfBodom> it was funny looking at emonggs viral Tok and the commenters all freakin out that Ram is gonna be op
[2022-12-08 17:07:55] <kosaderi> all his moves are situational, if used correctly very good

[2022-12-08 17:08:19] <Lebby710> Torb I think is a good ram counter because his ult is also a zoning ult
[2022-12-08 17:08:20] <%+wisteria_rose> @shxunaaa in game? they can take 24hrs to appear
[2022-12-08 17:08:21] <ChristianSharkTV> @drewmanjii_ Zen’a ult but does damage to enemies instead. It lasts for 3 seconds but the timer stops as long as you’re doing damage to someone

[2022-12-08 17:09:02] <xtraLeo> yeah ramattra is not op i would say he's like... low mid ? above rein jq and ball but like below the rest. but thats just me as a plat player speaking from what i've seen

[2022-12-08 17:13:52] <%SpookyAzul> yall are forgetting that his punches pierce shields... so the damage is entirely unavoidable outside of zarya bubbles (unless that's bugged) being able to force squishies to take 60dmg per punch is pretty strong

[2022-12-08 17:20:25] <finnorir> Am I the only one who thinks Ramattra’s transformation to nemesis form is kinda jarring

[2022-12-08 17:21:18] <InsomniaLozenges> @kosaderi they need to massively buff her lol, or else she's bad for unless the mains
[2022-12-08 17:21:22] <%$NightRemedy> I feel like she needs to do a bit more dmg so she's more of a threat

[2022-12-08 17:21:22] <+xmonkeygames> ive had 2 games playing as ramattra where the max healing the supports did was triple digits or just zero

[2022-12-08 17:21:38] <kosaderi> the buffs i think she deserves is, higher health, shorter shout cd and faster shout speed boost
[2022-12-08 17:21:39] <leotippmann> U can kill a wreckingball with one mag
[2022-12-08 17:21:47] <!%xx_m3m3_m4chine_420_69_xx> @BunnyGunGaming too much hair for jay3

[2022-12-08 17:24:18] <!%xx_m3m3_m4chine_420_69_xx> @Sypathic it's easy for me as i lock hog and never lose. games go by super fast

[2022-12-08 17:36:38] <InsomniaLozenges> @LyokoMatrix just buy the base one, it's worth it, but that's about it

[2022-12-08 17:36:55] <%bluespirit444> @LyokoMatrix yesss shes fun. the most fun to play out of all the supports imo

[2022-12-08 17:37:04] <Sypathic> Play of the game stealing the vitamin D
[2022-12-08 17:37:07] <TheUndizz> @katanacat342 Because she is pretty damn balanced. She is way to easy to play to buff her, but at the same time she brings so little value at the highest levels of play that nerfing would just kill the character
[2022-12-08 17:37:08] <+CAT_ON_LUDES> Vitamin D is fr soooo important though
[2022-12-08 17:37:12] <!%xx_m3m3_m4chine_420_69_xx> stacking is OP when you queue with me

[2022-12-08 18:09:50] <%faultysaeg> @BlazeTheEternal Genji's is a movement ability. Moira's is an invincible ability. I still stand Moira and Reaper should be able to fade out of Grav and FUCKING JUNK TRAP!
[2022-12-08 18:09:52] <ChristianSharkTV> @v00__d00 They do but the display for them is bugged on mobile so you have to go into a browser at some point today to check or claim
[2022-12-08 18:10:27] <%likhumkyu> do character like Genji and Tracer need high sensitivity to play?

[2022-12-08 18:40:07] <panda_senpai12> the biggest problem i have with rammatra transform is if you are aggainst another rammatra and use your nemesis form you will most likely lose if they go nemesis after you
[2022-12-08 18:40:19] <+V00__D00> yeah, I feel it should feel better. and definitely higher up
[2022-12-08 18:40:20] <%blondejohn96> 4 seconds is plenty long. chat sound like my wife again
[2022-12-08 18:40:28] <%+RedditKambo> @nothinggood27 i saw the buff and thought the bug was still a thing so i was confused
[2022-12-08 18:40:29] <kir0shi1> vortex need to be taller and he needs more hp like 600-650

[2022-12-08 18:41:00] <panda_senpai12> toggle would deff be amazing but maybe some sort of drawback

[2022-12-08 18:41:15] <%+nothinggood27> @RedditKambo yeah it was basically to "balance" the changes due to fixing the bug
[2022-12-08 18:41:15] <%$GhostshipRobot> Vortex needs to be a proper CC. Doesn't need much damage.
[2022-12-08 18:41:27] <%blondejohn96> wait wtf since when can moira heal???
[2022-12-08 18:41:28] <%+nothinggood27> @RAZERTRON04 you should be earning! just not showing

[2022-12-08 18:41:39] <onim2626> maybe give vortex a discord-esque debuff?
[2022-12-08 18:41:40] <Deathstrokes4> maybe vortex after a monkey jump in? idk
[2022-12-08 18:41:40] <RAZERTRON04> Ok whew lol
[2022-12-08 18:41:47] <%$GhostshipRobot> I think vortex and block both need something.
[2022-12-08 18:41:50] <panda_senpai12> vortex was advertised as a fly counter but is literally the worst aginst fliers
[2022-12-08 18:41:54] <%+nothinggood27> @RAZERTRON04 have to claim the first drop 2 hours in to start getting progress on the second, though!
[2022-12-08 18:41:56] <+FizzyGames> any compositions you view ramattra as strong against?
[2022-12-08 18:41:56] <RAZERTRON04> @nothinggood27 so when I get a drop I’ll be able to collect it?

[2022-12-08 18:42:00] <ghoullii> EIther make vortex taller, or have it do more damage
[2022-12-08 18:42:01] <+MilanMakes> best vortex buff is AOE size increase
[2022-12-08 18:42:06] <randomlyrandomnss> yeah vortex actually needs to pull down enemies
[2022-12-08 18:42:16] <%$GhostshipRobot> Vortex, again needs to be taller and capable of catching high speed heroes.
[2022-12-08 18:42:19] <BethanyDrive> Ram’s vortex and Soj’s grenade should have their damage/utility swapped
[2022-12-08 18:42:21] <%Kusk> I imagine we'll see some balance changes in the weeks after he becomes available in ranked
[2022-12-08 18:42:28] <+Kingumikki> imagine an orissa and a ramattra ult together.. wow. 2 tanks in the game would be a crazy concept. *sadness*
[2022-12-08 18:42:32] <%crypttechnikian> he counters himself tbh
[2022-12-08 18:42:33] <+wowthisisalongname221> rammatra needs more damage in general tbh
[2022-12-08 18:42:41] <panda_senpai12> rammatra is a counter to rammatra thats not good imo

[2022-12-08 19:00:56] <ManateeCannon> I think they nerfed the hitbox going from alpha to open beta, then reverted it for the second beta

[2022-12-08 19:01:41] <%$Tripod45> I think they could give more bleed healing
[2022-12-08 19:01:47] <xGooodluck> did they make torb projectile smaller?
[2022-12-08 19:01:49] <+dookieshoes93> Just self sustain. I know they don’t wait goats
[2022-12-08 19:01:52] <%sharrptooth> my question is- how do we get DF out of this game :)

[2022-12-08 19:01:56] <+Admiral_Lando> The goal shouldn't be balance. Too many moving parts in a game like this. The goal should be to cycle healthy fun metas in my opinion.

[2022-12-08 19:02:05] <+adrockgreybeard> HURT BOX - it’s a term fighting games use. Hit box for you, hurt box for opponent
[2022-12-08 19:02:08] <%SweetVelosa> It was nice
[2022-12-08 19:02:08] <+dookieshoes93> @sharrptooth let doom be meta for once!!

[2022-12-08 19:03:13] <%SpookyAzul> they need to make her wounds do actual damage, it's just laughable how bad wounds are. widow venom mine has a higher tick rate and does more damage. i think upping the wounds to 25 for knife and 50 for axe would be good

[2022-12-08 19:38:06] <hackspartak> I would like Anubis Temple
[2022-12-08 19:38:09] <Barkh4n> 2cp is great at low tier because people are goofballs, you pros ruin it for everyone
[2022-12-08 19:38:13] <yanderesann> @avariataria It’s keeping track u just have to go on desktop to check progress and claim
[2022-12-08 19:38:16] <+buckyboyd> @MisterBriGuy_ they're supposedly doing that
[2022-12-08 19:38:17] <Leinadlink> didn't lunar colony get reworked more than any other map in the game?
[2022-12-08 19:38:18] <xboy0607> lunar colony point 1 is GOOD
[2022-12-08 19:38:20] <+Lacrymosa22> Anubis is my fav map
[2022-12-08 19:38:21] <+chuckyyb> anubis POG

[2022-12-08 19:38:27] <+bawbob> 2cp just needed to see how many cap points each team could get in one turn each instead of resetting constantly... the maps were good
[2022-12-08 19:38:29] <ManateeCannon> @Leinadlink the symmetra of maps

[2022-12-08 19:40:27] <Assimilater> If push was shorter so it was easier to full cap and end a lopsided game quicker, and if you didn’t have to walk the bot back to the barricade only for the enemy to be regrouped and you have made no progress for winning the previous fight it might not be so bad....but it is
[2022-12-08 19:40:28] <%+TrendEnder84> why does it play poorly?

[2022-12-08 19:41:02] <Leinadlink> maybe 2CP wouldn't be so bad if the maps weren't designed like that. Like why does the second point have to be literally on top of the defending spawn?

[2022-12-08 19:48:34] <Leinadlink> the tank role looks so odd with that chunk where there's missing a character

[2022-12-08 20:51:46] <%Vars437> Better play some Hearthstone in Blizzard World
[2022-12-08 20:51:47] <Forsakei> @EgoShock For sure. Especially considering most of the maps were small anyway.

[2022-12-08 20:52:10] <%urban69ing08> @HelloBeardo i loved some 2cp maps. petra and the japanese one were great
[2022-12-08 20:52:11] <Assimilater> 2cp might not even be as bad with only one tank
[2022-12-08 20:52:13] <%+Jjman93> Blizz world has so many great easter eggs around the map

[2022-12-08 20:53:39] <Assimilater> @urban69ing08 push as a mode sucks. When you win a fight and stop the enemy push you bring it back to the middle before they regroup and don't make any real progress despite winning the bot back
