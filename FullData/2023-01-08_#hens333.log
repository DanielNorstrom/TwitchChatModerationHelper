[2023-01-08 14:42:44] <%frederickmain> n I really is easy when you get the hang of things, Blight is always hard
[2023-01-08 14:42:48] <%frederickmain> nurse*
[2023-01-08 14:42:55] <Teo_xs91> She needs decent muscle memory  and that's about it
[2023-01-08 14:42:55] <geckadro> I think the biggest skillcap is blinking on a different floor
[2023-01-08 14:42:56] <+KaleBoei> true its just muscle memory for blink timings YesYes
[2023-01-08 14:43:12] <%grimmlament2> Hi everyone, hope y'all having a good day hensPwease
[2023-01-08 14:43:16] <%mango_moreno> speaking of good killers, haven't you thought about playing again permanent infection with wesker?
[2023-01-08 14:43:23] <%+crazy_microwave> ok the Nurse can blink but like why the survivors dont just close their eyes? lmao
[2023-01-08 14:43:27] <%mango_moreno> I liked that video
[2023-01-08 14:43:29] <Stepka_Bandera> People took that strat as an opportunity to turture survivors
[2023-01-08 14:43:43] <JulianCalabasas> @forestgrandpa I would be very interested to see the average players hours. Some people think it's like 300 but some think it's 50 and that can completely change the meaning of "balancing for the average player"
[2023-01-08 14:43:43] <KapoTenTate> Hi Hens, should you always play around a 3 gen as killer?
[2023-01-08 14:43:45] <+ArchAbhor> @crazy_microwave wow

[2023-01-08 14:44:11] <%+ForestGrandpa> I am more inclined to believe its probably somewhere between 100 to 200 hours

[2023-01-08 14:47:30] <Mante11agunmen> Howdy everyone
[2023-01-08 14:47:36] <!%roxannagv> just use blastmine and you'll get no gen kick killers
[2023-01-08 14:47:41] <%Tobi_x02> you can just extend the games length without any hope for the survivors
[2023-01-08 14:47:42] <+MrZeroVI> id rather have eruption put me in deep wound or something rather than incapacitated
[2023-01-08 14:47:43] <!%roxannagv> i got 2 eruption in 20 games
[2023-01-08 14:47:43] <tricks5776> I just want them to decrease the incapacitated time
[2023-01-08 14:47:48] <JulianCalabasas> People who want Eruption buffed to be an AOE<<<<<<<<<
[2023-01-08 14:47:50] <osirus1224> I would play surv way more if it was nerfed
[2023-01-08 14:47:53] <%+crazy_microwave> they just need to tune down a number its honestly not that hard so maybe eruption nerf is coming this midchapter COPIUM
[2023-01-08 14:47:55] <GhostyBoy24_> What do you think about current Dh
[2023-01-08 14:48:01] <%frederickmain> holy I played a game today with just eruption against my friends with full gen rush builds and still won because of 3 genning
[2023-01-08 14:48:02] <tricks5776> Almost half a minute is too long after playing with and against it

[2023-01-08 14:48:11] <LoveMom> incapacitate is too strong
[2023-01-08 14:48:13] <%+chrisfufuu> A perk can be strong, but Eruption is just so boring to play against, especially in SoloQ

[2023-01-08 14:48:38] <osirus1224> I used eruption for one week and got a 30 win streak on doctor never again too cruel
[2023-01-08 14:48:46] <+phoenixloumi> I dont think dh for distance was the main issue
[2023-01-08 14:48:53] <!%roxannagv> it's so satifsfying when they wait ages and still hit the dh tho KEKW
[2023-01-08 14:49:00] <%frederickmain> @phoenixloumi hot take
[2023-01-08 14:49:02] <swoope94> @JulianCalabasas I feel like theres a gigantic chunk of players with 200-500 hours but I would say in grand scheme 1-2k hours is still "new" or low hours. its after 2k hours when people expect you to be a good amount better than the avg player

[2023-01-08 14:49:53] <geckadro> What do you think about a startup on DH, so they cannot react to your normal swing?
[2023-01-08 14:49:58] <+KaleBoei> despair Eruption
[2023-01-08 14:50:09] <GhostyBoy24_> Do you think the gap of strength between Nurse and Pig (let's say) is too high ?
[2023-01-08 14:50:09] <%+crazy_microwave> dh for distance was the most proplematic aspect of the most annoying perk of dbd
[2023-01-08 14:50:15] <JulianCalabasas> @phoenixloumi same, I avoided using it since it seemed OP but then I wanted to practice for a tourney and put it on, my winrate was above 95%...
[2023-01-08 14:50:15] <keitatakamurav3> guess we'll get DH users to scream fus ro dah before activating it
[2023-01-08 14:50:18] <+phoenixloumi> imo it should be like a sb in a bottle, not a dash forward but not so that the killer needs to wait it out maybe... idk really

[2023-01-08 15:46:54] <sara_slayzz> Sometimes it’s not a swf,  it just a stacked solo team.

[2023-01-08 15:47:05] <BulgeConnoisseur> if hes mad now, wait until the icons are in the game Kappa

[2023-01-08 15:47:10] <WindyC_97> silly me
[2023-01-08 15:47:16] <life_blight> if you just have 4 people who sit on gens you will usually win as a survivor
[2023-01-08 15:47:18] <+NekoShepherd> I love to deny expectations by playing like garbage when I'm in a SWYF and comping in SoloQ
[2023-01-08 15:47:21] <!%Laser_EU> he chased me with balanced on main and 2 of the best pallets u can have on main
[2023-01-08 15:47:26] <!%Laser_EU> thats just, unfortunate

[2023-01-08 15:47:28] <%chersonnus> bad choices of chases led to him 'losing'

[2023-01-08 15:48:09] <+MrZeroVI> had someone -rep me saying i was cheating using 3rd party software for communication i.e. discord XD
[2023-01-08 15:48:14] <%+Fliperotchy> according to mad killers, all swf are good at the game by default so if they lose it has to be because of swf
[2023-01-08 15:48:17] <Quillix92> that guy must love the incoming patch if he hates survs communication
[2023-01-08 15:48:27] <Leukodystrophy> poor matchmaking probably made him frustrated, and then said some dumb shit out because of it.
[2023-01-08 15:48:29] <yolocrafterftw> i mean we’ve all done it before tbf in something “they won? Can’t be just cos they’re better”

[2023-01-08 15:48:54] <afterjoy> i hate when people have friends and talk to each other
[2023-01-08 15:49:10] <+Jayce913> well, he never said to stick it into a live electric socket

[2023-01-08 15:49:51] <%sam_vilderness> @chase_roo_ its actually setup as well, if the setup is cracked im less likely to chase that person irrespective of good or bad
[2023-01-08 15:49:53] <keitatakamurav3> Imagine if it's him again, there's the flan

[2023-01-08 15:50:09] <%+Fliperotchy> @Chase_Roo_  you're not going to get better at the game by leaving every good survivor in chase and hoping mmr has at least 1 bad player on their team

[2023-01-08 16:29:24] <stalemaccasfries> @imryurj did u mean who? bc my fav killer rn is bubba. he’s fun to play, fun to go against (ignoring face camping bubbas)
[2023-01-08 16:29:45] <+imryurj> yeah who
[2023-01-08 16:29:46] <asyashi> bubba isnt fun to go against because hes boring and slow and weak

[2023-01-08 16:30:18] <%+murphyslaw55> chase bubba's are fun, camping bubba's aren't
[2023-01-08 16:30:23] <stalemaccasfries> i agree with hens
[2023-01-08 16:30:27] <stalemaccasfries> personally
[2023-01-08 16:30:29] <life_blight> Bubba feels right for the game
[2023-01-08 16:30:32] <%mango_moreno> basement buba please
[2023-01-08 16:30:33] <%GENJ1SMOM> billy, demo, bubba would probably be top 3
[2023-01-08 16:30:39] <%ClussyHonks> I'd rather go against a Billy than a bubba
[2023-01-08 16:30:39] <%+Bazzpp> i love him as long as he isn't standing in front on a hook all game
[2023-01-08 16:30:40] <%itizAJ> @murphyslaw55 camping bubba is funny after u loop them
[2023-01-08 16:30:53] <K_Lite> people who hate bubba just associate him with camping

[2023-01-08 16:30:55] <%+murphyslaw55> @itizaj yes, but not if you don't
[2023-01-08 16:30:56] <+therollerdude> Camping Bubba's don't even upset me. What upsets me is solo queue survivors staring at Bubba camping instead of doing gens.
[2023-01-08 16:30:58] <!%BekahW_> if you asked me when i first started playing who my least favourite killer to play againsr was, Bubba was top of the list.. Now he's my 2nd favourite to play against

[2023-01-08 16:52:14] <stalemaccasfries> @ragingmonkie_official the add on makes her 4.4m/s / 110%, but she could have had pwyf since it’s an insane perk on nurse rn. it doesnt lose stacks from blink attacks (thats definitely a bug though) and it increases her blink speed

[2023-01-08 16:53:18] <+hoppedcab> @Nazbaz12 they could main killer and just use their points or surv
[2023-01-08 16:53:30] <asyashi> 30 hrs a day?

[2023-01-08 16:53:47] <stalemaccasfries> @ragingmonkie_official i could imagine but not relate bc i’ve only gone against camping knight and 7 blink nurse on the ptb
[2023-01-08 16:53:51] <+Steve8K> 30 hrs A DAY POGGIES
[2023-01-08 16:53:52] <UncleStanBana> Its like devotion
[2023-01-08 16:53:59] <%GENJ1SMOM> 3o hours a day is sigma grind chat
[2023-01-08 16:54:01] <+SkeletalElite> grinding dbd so hard he made a day 6 hours longer damn
[2023-01-08 16:54:05] <UncleStanBana> But now nobody talks about devotion anymore KEKW
[2023-01-08 16:54:06] <Fenderz_> I think it usually means someone spends a lot of time with a killer
[2023-01-08 16:54:06] <keitatakamurav3> 24 hours a day is overrated too :KEKW:
[2023-01-08 16:54:08] <Kapalina> its not about p100, its about the 5k clear raegant addons KEKW
[2023-01-08 16:54:11] <TheEngine02> i dropped my phone an hour ago and now its dead Sadge
[2023-01-08 16:54:12] <asyashi> you get permamanet level 50 bloodweb right?
[2023-01-08 16:54:15] <Alen_Starkly> the only thing that matters is P 100 Ace NODDERS
[2023-01-08 16:54:21] <%SarahlMS> p100 just means you played a lot, don't mean they are good, there is people with 1k hours who just don't want to learn the game
[2023-01-08 16:54:21] <unclebensuncle> would be cool if it was an xp thing where you had to play the killer to get prestige
[2023-01-08 16:54:28] <oixxiy> hi hens333 otzBlushA otzBlushA otzBlushA
[2023-01-08 16:54:29] <maniq1231> can you do twitch for a living? (no hate just curious)
[2023-01-08 16:54:31] <+Ignition57> I get tunneled for being high prestige surivor
[2023-01-08 16:54:37] <Nazbaz12> it could be a lot of things. when i see a survivor with p5, they could have another character who is p100. but i dont see or know that. so of course it isnt a reliable thing to go by, but when u see a p100, then for me id assume they have experience
[2023-01-08 16:54:37] <+Ignition57> its so weird
[2023-01-08 16:54:37] <+PokePony64> like p100 is cool an all, but can you 360 chainsaw me as billy? that'd be cool
[2023-01-08 16:54:41] <stalemaccasfries> that’s actually a cracked idea i should start using my clear reagents
[2023-01-08 16:54:42] <asyashi> they will probably add rewards for p100 at some point anyway
[2023-01-08 16:54:44] <TheManFromTheEgg> @TheEngine02 Congrats, you are finally free.

[2023-01-08 16:55:16] <GandorTheGreat> it means you played enough in last X months to earn 100 prestiges worth of BP. it's like badge that you played recently the game a lot @hens333
[2023-01-08 16:55:24] <Nazbaz12> a killer main spending lots on survivor is common? to me id assume it is very unlikely since the killer would want to spend for killers to get offerings and addons. why spend insane amount on survivor
[2023-01-08 16:55:31] <ukeerz> can you live out of streaming dbd only?

[2023-01-08 16:56:37] <HappyFuzzle> its funny how you got blamed by a teammate because the killer was camping :D
[2023-01-08 16:56:41] <Nazbaz12> @Bazzpp true, me too. uve only seen one p100 killer
[2023-01-08 16:56:46] <%ClussyHonks> hens has 8144 hours in dbd EZ
[2023-01-08 16:56:48] <Kapalina> look at the FAQ, or a p100 billy will appear on your doorstep hensFine
[2023-01-08 16:56:50] <Nazbaz12> then again i play killer
[2023-01-08 16:56:54] <%SarahlMS> I know smaller streamers can do this for living, but I really believe depends on the leanguage you speak and the country you live. 5 dollars may be a lot or may be just 5 dollars
[2023-01-08 16:56:55] <%GENJ1SMOM> @quossss yes
[2023-01-08 16:56:57] <+huwwooo> He said a streamer of his size should’ve able to I believe @ukeerz

[2023-01-08 16:58:07] <Nazbaz12> killers are mor elikely to switch around characters. since needless to say, it has a difference. but playing different survivors ultimately doesnt make a huge difference.
[2023-01-08 16:58:08] <%ClussyHonks> do blood orbs despawn after a long while or do they stay indefinitely?
[2023-01-08 16:58:26] <Nazbaz12> ah man, i hate that window

[2023-01-08 16:59:31] <+TeremunArt> did they nerf oni? Looks like that this much blood gave you quite less power
[2023-01-08 16:59:44] <%SarahlMS> don't oni have a add-on to make people scream?

[2023-01-08 17:13:59] <%+murphyslaw55> oh you mean new wiggle plus boil over?
[2023-01-08 17:14:04] <Nazbaz12> what's the new boil over?? is it the wiggle movement?
[2023-01-08 17:14:31] <GandorTheGreat> @hens333 what? boil over? are you perhaps console? That perk is tra.sh once you synch your timing
[2023-01-08 17:15:07] <Kapalina> but theres still enough pools

[2023-01-08 17:22:57] <stalemaccasfries> @icecreaminspace they shouldn’t have grouped up
[2023-01-08 17:23:00] <%Cairsoir> I feel Plague is simple enough but there's some management aspet with pools, when to do X and obviously the arc and how puke works

[2023-01-08 17:31:42] <%+pocketcandies> i've had the christ tunneled out of me by more weskers than most other killers

[2023-01-08 17:31:50] <$greyglacier> all killers tunnel bro, it's not the killer, it's the player
[2023-01-08 17:31:58] <%GENJ1SMOM> a lot of players tunnel. There is a big chance some killers  don't tunnel like billy or demo cause they play for fun and not to win at 5 gens
[2023-01-08 17:31:58] <%$styff__> It's so easy to tunnel as Wesker because of the hinder
[2023-01-08 17:31:58] <LaniDude91> As Nemi, I’d tunnel stars characters for the memes :)
[2023-01-08 17:32:02] <+ni1ina4a> YES! I always get tunneled by weskers

[2023-01-08 17:33:49] <%GENJ1SMOM> @RezedentSleeper straving? Yeah he does that
[2023-01-08 17:33:58] <beereyy> @ragingmonkie_official naaah you can do so much more with wesker's kit than just tunneling
[2023-01-08 17:33:59] <frinter90> They should buff Nemesis. Lower the number of vaccines in the to 2 and he is going to be in a good spot.
[2023-01-08 17:33:59] <%SarahlMS> why nemi looks so much faster when you play survivor?

[2023-01-08 17:36:42] <%Cairsoir> you know chat I hate the hillbilly circlejerk, since the rare occasions I get one they are just budget bubbas who tunnel relentlessly and try to camp with their saws
[2023-01-08 17:36:43] <%SarahlMS> bubba, is not tunnel if you die first hook
[2023-01-08 17:36:44] <frinter90> Trickster never tunnels because nobody plays him

[2023-01-08 17:37:33] <+RezedentSleeper> billy and huntress main GIGACHAD also tunnels on nemi x2 GIGACHAD
[2023-01-08 17:37:34] <+therollerdude> @Cairsoir They still get a pass in my book. They're playing Hillbilly who I see less than Hag so
[2023-01-08 17:37:42] <llyod103> when was the last time you guys have seen a hilbilly with one or more game delay perk
[2023-01-08 17:37:47] <%RagingMonkie_Official> tbh its rare to have a game without tunnels and when thats the case the killer is usually farming
[2023-01-08 17:37:57] <GandorTheGreat> @nice_feed u r not in high enough range. blights are tryhrads. they will tunnel if it helps in any way

[2023-01-08 17:43:44] <UncleStanBana> I think consoles are good when they got a nice exclusive game
[2023-01-08 17:43:57] <%GENJ1SMOM> I hope they do. I'm not gonna do the grind again

[2023-01-08 18:29:57] <+Slyvaina> They just need to play with ideas for him. Just give him all his traps.

[2023-01-08 18:30:17] <imluckygamer777> i think deathslinger is worse than trapper tbh
[2023-01-08 18:30:22] <Cormiie_> at least trapper can use his power, it's not Sadako LUL
[2023-01-08 18:30:27] <SuLLycV> I would say Freddy is worse
[2023-01-08 18:30:27] <%Chief_Ohnay> I started as a Clown main because he was very easy to learn (at low level) and because he was considered to have an extremely weak kit. Same reason I put a lot of time into learning Myers.
[2023-01-08 18:30:31] <+troggy242> Why is he the worst? Is it a speed issue? Im kinda new
[2023-01-08 18:30:34] <imluckygamer777> or freddy
[2023-01-08 18:30:42] <nice_feed> trappper is fun until someone makes his mission to only disarm your trap
[2023-01-08 18:31:04] <%+murphyslaw55> pallet Freddy is way worse

[2023-01-08 18:31:12] <moppie9112> what is the best killer and survivour to start whit because i am new to bdb
[2023-01-08 18:31:13] <SuLLycV> @troggy242 trapper has a basic power it's not really a power.. he just sets traps
[2023-01-08 18:31:26] <peanutbutt3r67> Any form of Freddy is so much worse
[2023-01-08 18:31:26] <peanut_butter_72618264> i thought myers is even worse
[2023-01-08 18:31:32] <%MonsterKillxDD> He slow vaulted in front of you it didnt look legit
[2023-01-08 18:31:34] <+troggy242> Oh okay, makes sense thank you
[2023-01-08 18:31:36] <imluckygamer777> trapper is 100% better than freddy or deathslinger tbh.
[2023-01-08 18:31:40] <%ObsidianLiger> sadako and freddy can teleport for the very least which gives them a lot of gen pressure
[2023-01-08 18:31:45] VIEWERS: 780
[2023-01-08 18:31:48] <Mercurial42> @troggy242 it's because he takes a REALLY long time to set up a 100% counterable power
[2023-01-08 18:31:52] <%+murphyslaw55> pallet Freddy specifically is worse IMHO
[2023-01-08 18:31:53] <SuLLycV> @imluckygamer777 slinger?? slinger is insanely oppressive lol
[2023-01-08 18:31:58] <Mercurial42> so he's very time inefficient and the power isn't very strongt
[2023-01-08 18:32:02] <+HansGetTheFLammenwerfer> myers is weak but way more consitent than trapper
[2023-01-08 18:32:03] <MadDogRyo> everything work and still 1 gen left. this is tell something
[2023-01-08 18:32:03] <peanutbutt3r67> Slinger is super good
[2023-01-08 18:32:06] <+lnterfear> really map dependent too
[2023-01-08 18:32:06] <moppie9112> what is the best killer and survivour to start whit because i am new to bdb
[2023-01-08 18:32:10] <%Sorosti> I think that dbd wants players to rely on mechanics and muscle memory over brain plays in my opinion
[2023-01-08 18:32:10] <imluckygamer777> @SuLLycV and trapper not?
[2023-01-08 18:32:12] <%+murphyslaw55> does anyone remember the old yellow traps?
[2023-01-08 18:32:18] <SuLLycV> @imluckygamer777 correct?
[2023-01-08 18:32:19] <%unclebensuncle> myers is weak or you bring addons and youre good
[2023-01-08 18:32:19] <theh0pester> how could they buff trapper do you think?
[2023-01-08 18:32:21] <el_the_shaman> really wish a trapper trap would go invisible after like 60 seconds or 2 minutes or something
[2023-01-08 18:32:34] <peanutbutt3r67> I used to be a trapper main like you, but then I took a pallet to the knee
[2023-01-08 18:32:38] <%MonsterKillxDD> He should have pink traps but they should insta mori BloodTrail
[2023-01-08 18:32:41] <%ObsidianLiger> Eveen otz is like "Don't play trapper"
[2023-01-08 18:32:46] <%SarahlMS> @Hens333 imagine a add-on that make his traps get the color palette of the ground
[2023-01-08 18:32:47] <+troggy242> I see, that makes sense now. Ty

[2023-01-08 18:33:29] <theh0pester> that would make him better, do you think that they could make it where there always a chance when disarming you get injured?
[2023-01-08 18:33:33] <$greyglacier> that would be cool
[2023-01-08 18:33:35] <%ObsidianLiger> yeah there is a new bubba cat and mouse game coming out so it makes a lot of sense
[2023-01-08 18:33:36] <+HansGetTheFLammenwerfer> or put the traps on like a cooldown , you start with 2 and get one every 20 seconds

[2023-01-08 19:01:14] <rock344> seen a 100IQ play on a short, basically when a survivor got off the hook next to the gate he ran to the gate and the killer went for the tunnel, he pointed at the switch so the killer thought he lost BT

[2023-01-08 19:37:22] <%+globo12343> @dakodi_ only reason is because most surv teams run the build to finish gens quickly. Most killers can’t really afford for long chases now without risking 2 gens getting done

[2023-01-08 20:01:04] <Pandom__> My advice for phasing is to use it as much as you're confident with, but to also not overuse it
[2023-01-08 20:01:05] <dakodi_> I mean, there’s certain ways to run tiles as killers @hbombdaboss

[2023-01-08 20:01:10] <hbombdaboss> If u have a good headset spirit should be easy to pick up
[2023-01-08 20:01:17] <hbombdaboss> Yeah but phasing is situational

[2023-01-08 20:03:08] <Pandom__> I think it's insane on Spirit, I really like using it with Starstruck too @Sorin_Markov_
[2023-01-08 20:03:12] <dakodi_> there are alot of mechanics in looping for killers like blight but spirit everyone’s just like “listen” 😂
[2023-01-08 20:03:53] <hbombdaboss> It’s all audio oriented. Have good game/map awareness and spirit becomes s tier @dakodi_

[2023-01-08 20:05:08] <dakodi_> I just hear in comp all the time being a good spirit is very difficult and I am just like what’s the difference in skill based off
[2023-01-08 20:05:13] <+Sorin_Markov_> Spirit is very good, your friend must not be playing against good killers
[2023-01-08 20:05:19] <%SarahlMS> after playing spirit for many hours you start to understand how most survivors react to phasing
[2023-01-08 20:05:31] <Pandom__> Honestly I would almost say Spirit is underrated
[2023-01-08 20:05:54] <OniAsuma> yoooooooo

[2023-01-08 20:06:16] <Pandom__> @hbombdaboss a lot of people don't consider her S tier these days, which is why I think she is underrated LUL
[2023-01-08 20:06:42] <corretin> @Pandom__ who doesnt? i dont know a single person
[2023-01-08 20:06:48] <dakodi_> she’s definitely weaker now thst you can pinpoint her location
[2023-01-08 20:06:50] <hbombdaboss> Otz and hens say S tier. I wouldn’t doubt them lmao.
[2023-01-08 20:07:04] <+dubs_98> @sorin_markov_ I've been saying to him she's strong when she doesn't miss a phase
[2023-01-08 20:07:17] <%osthytakesdebit> @hbombdaboss lol
[2023-01-08 20:07:22] <+VT_Doggo> spirit is a solid A tier
[2023-01-08 20:07:23] <hbombdaboss> I got shit on
[2023-01-08 20:07:28] <%osthytakesdebit> hahahaha
[2023-01-08 20:07:29] <%osthytakesdebit> <3
[2023-01-08 20:07:47] <hbombdaboss> So then A tier?
[2023-01-08 20:07:48] <corretin> nurse/blight s+, spirit s, then the rest on A
[2023-01-08 20:08:01] <%SarahlMS> @Hens333 as a spirit main, I say it is about who can read the other pathing better
[2023-01-08 20:08:08] <@%animeangel09> perk otz face otzKEK
[2023-01-08 20:08:14] <Pandom__> @corretin honestly I could agree with this much but I would also argue Artist could be either in S or A+
[2023-01-08 20:08:14] VIEWERS: 701
[2023-01-08 20:08:18] <+am_branch> spirit before woosh rework though, i say she could compete back then
[2023-01-08 20:08:29] <hbombdaboss> @pandom__ I agree with the artist rating forsure
[2023-01-08 20:08:33] <hbombdaboss> In the right hands
[2023-01-08 20:08:35] <bubba_2022> spirit with mdr and amulett is stronger than blight
[2023-01-08 20:08:37] <+lnterfear> Bubba S++
[2023-01-08 20:08:46] <hbombdaboss> Bubba god tier
[2023-01-08 20:09:12] <%osthytakesdebit> garden of joy not survivor sided? lol
[2023-01-08 20:09:16] <corretin> @Pandom__ yaa, i think spirit is a little bit higher, but not too much
[2023-01-08 20:09:38] <ddestructor_> Is this missing RPD West Wing?
[2023-01-08 20:09:38] <%osthytakesdebit> wait is the s here good or bad
[2023-01-08 20:09:39] <HanoverF> RPD is killer sided because survivors will just leftiNico ? Kappa
[2023-01-08 20:09:50] <LastFir34> Shelter is big af so m1 killers suffer a lot
[2023-01-08 20:09:55] <dakodi_> It’s k and s for killer and survivor @osthytakesdebit
[2023-01-08 20:09:59] <lukeyvv> @ddestructor_ underneath shelter woods
[2023-01-08 20:10:00] <HanoverF> @ddestructor_ west is in the middle

[2023-01-08 20:10:29] <hbombdaboss> Rotten fields with a cracked huntress is insane
[2023-01-08 20:10:29] <+Sorin_Markov_> Where is Garden?  I can't see it
[2023-01-08 20:10:39] <hbombdaboss> @sorin_markov_ it’s survivor sided.
[2023-01-08 20:10:41] <Dragonlord_Placidusax> @Sorin_Markov_ bottom tier first from the left
[2023-01-08 20:10:44] <dakodi_> Why is sanctum of wrath sole

[2023-01-08 20:10:59] <%ObsidianLiger> it's not difficult to hold a 3-gen on azarov's too
[2023-01-08 20:11:00] <corretin> nurse/blight s+, spirit s, then the rest on A. what about that @Hens333?
[2023-01-08 20:11:05] <%MaxxDW> I just joined, did you already say what you think Eyrie would be after the changes?
[2023-01-08 20:11:07] <ddestructor_> Which is better? Spirit or Artist?

[2023-01-08 20:11:30] <bubba_2022> artist is overrated
[2023-01-08 20:11:49] <hbombdaboss> Artist is insane in the right hands
[2023-01-08 20:12:06] <dakodi_> cenobite and slinger that high?
[2023-01-08 20:12:15] VIEWERS: 685
[2023-01-08 20:12:15] <ddestructor_> With the changes on PTB, the Twins would go to low A tier?
[2023-01-08 20:12:15] <+Sorin_Markov_> Artist is very good
[2023-01-08 20:12:20] <alchemist_cr0w> Artist is absolutely oppressive if played right
[2023-01-08 20:12:20] <Pandom__> Artist can facecamp every single gen and a hook at the same time
[2023-01-08 20:12:26] <%osthytakesdebit> oni too high
