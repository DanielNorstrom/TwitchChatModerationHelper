[2023-01-06 16:18:11] <DirtyDeeds765> i think if we are going to the Telvanni peninsula, spellcrafting would make sense because they are very powerful wizards (the telvanni) and like you said, morrowind was the first game spellcrafting was in

[2023-01-06 16:20:07] <%+Airikaybeni> NG+ for overworld content with higher difficulty would be "new"
[2023-01-06 16:20:15] <DirtyDeeds765> when they mentioned the most requested feature, it was when they mentioned the chapter. the system is to come later in the year
[2023-01-06 16:20:29] <belfastcl> i did but no idea what's coming, I didn't expect a card game either

[2023-01-06 20:26:16] <%+Surragard> I don’t think so. I thought the Aldmeri came from another continent and the Khajiit were already on Tamriel but I’m not sure.
[2023-01-06 20:26:32] <%+Zieffre> Bosmer Warden just drips lore :p
[2023-01-06 20:26:39] <ItsSkaara> Thought kahjiits had some moon stuff going on

[2023-01-06 20:30:45] <%+scifisarah> it wouldn't be that bad they could just take the art from the existing ones and change them slightly

Quick query: Console is experiencing the CP bug where we have to fully respect and re slot in order for it to fix itself. It's not all the time, but it's definitely annoying when doing vet trials.  Is PC experiencing that bug as well?
