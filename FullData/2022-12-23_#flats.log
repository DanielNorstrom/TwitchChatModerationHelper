[2022-12-23 01:50:49] <%+pandamension> @slippzk_ I get ya, if she is a extrovert then it won't be long till she will have new friends. If she is a introvert, then will take a bit more time. Help her through this, and try to set up double dates with your friends who are in a relationship.
[2022-12-23 01:50:52] <Archybaldie> Good thing is you can picture in picture emongg into a tiny box in the corner and you lose no visual quality lol

[2022-12-23 01:51:02] <$Suspect333> emongg is having a day lol
[2022-12-23 01:51:15] <szn_0000> console really hinders the dps moira experienc3

[2022-12-23 01:57:50] <%+Hakuna_Mufasa> @joshyjoshyfish its one reason they didnt have aim assist, cuz you were being put into the PC lobbies where they dont have it. and they didnt want PC players to just group with console for easier games
[2022-12-23 01:57:59] <RadDadOverwatch> There’s an OLED swirch but I think the processing capabilities are the same

[2022-12-23 01:58:04] <A1c4tr4zz> @FastPhil19 I think overwatch puts the groups in pc lobbies if there is a pc player in the group

[2022-12-23 19:51:20] <%FireBadLuck> State tax and income tax are two different types of taxes in the United States. State tax is imposed by individual states and can include sales tax, property tax, and income tax. Income tax is a tax on an individual's income and is imposed at both the federal and state levels. Both federal and state income taxes are progressive, but the specific tax rates and income thresholds vary by state. Some states do not have an income tax.

[2022-12-23 20:56:38] <@%flyingfish1230> in those custom lobbies
[2022-12-23 20:56:39] <%ow_sigmaeats> @flats just make hog not be able to heal and hook so just make him not have any abilities
[2022-12-23 20:56:39] <+keveatsglue> in custom lobbies can go up to 12
[2022-12-23 20:56:43] <%skallywaggery> Rein Invasion has over a dozen but it crashes all the time

[2022-12-23 20:56:45] <+destro1231> they should make his hook grab around corners again and him do like no damage
[2022-12-23 20:56:48] <%+Thrahx_Vaug> People talking about nerfing Hog's sustain into the ground forget he is a tank.
[2022-12-23 20:56:51] <+TheGoatGeek> "if i see you you die" has more than 12 I think
[2022-12-23 20:56:51] <torjarfluffyboi> how do you spectate anyway?
[2022-12-23 20:56:52] <Lt_kitsune> 6v6 instead of open queue would be superb
[2022-12-23 20:56:52] <NightSpinner_> They replace his self heal with a Widow grapple hook too

[2022-12-23 20:56:59] <%hannibal314> flats, any thoughts on how to make tank feel less like a game of rock paper scissor?  it feels like it's always better to switch into a more favorable matchup right now
[2022-12-23 20:57:03] <%$lowtabzz> watch them pull a sojourn with hog

[2022-12-23 20:57:09] <NightSpinner_> imagine hog with a Widow grapple
[2022-12-23 20:57:10] <%+UnorthodoxIam> what do you think of samitos take that open queue should take the place of role queue to lower queue times
[2022-12-23 20:57:15] <%FireBadLuck> Hog nerf should be if he hooks someone, the Hog dies
[2022-12-23 20:57:20] <ONderFross___> Hook should just do damage and knock away imo
[2022-12-23 20:57:21] <talllittleshortie> Hog needs to be completely nuked out of the game, he’s just totally unfun to play and play against… (this may or not be my support player angst)

[2022-12-23 21:17:38] <RadDadOverwatch> She wasn’t Getting played in OWL, then they buffed railgun size and she became insane
[2022-12-23 21:17:56] <RuleOfTwo> just eliminate all one shots aside from widow/hanzo sniper style stuff.. simple
[2022-12-23 21:18:02] <%$DeIta9> some owl players were playing sojourn at the beginning. they buffed railgun hit box and she became must pick
[2022-12-23 21:18:04] <doomfish25> Balance Team NEEDS to look at heroes who don’t get picked  Improve the less picked heroes and improve the overall balance by doing so.  By only changing the heroes with high picks rate, doesn’t actually change anything.  (Aka Talking about Supports and other like heroes)  Aka Devs have been doing Survivorship Bias. (Basically a flawed Balance philosophy.)

[2022-12-23 21:23:03] <bobhog> thats why they shouldn't have taken down overwatch 1, when OW1 was way more stable

[2022-12-23 21:23:31] <%FireBadLuck> The devs are on break, so people gotta chill
[2022-12-23 21:23:34] <%MADcees> NODDERS
[2022-12-23 21:23:53] <TrustedTerror45> @pixel_gobelin TRUE!
[2022-12-23 21:23:58] <w_Howl> @Pixel_Gobelin XD a good ol- genji nerf is never a bad thing
[2022-12-23 21:23:58] <charleyb166> in my opinion pockets are not even the worst thing in the game .. unless it’s an air hero such as pharah it makes it annoying
[2022-12-23 21:24:04] <+AFrogsBones> !lurk
[2022-12-23 21:24:08] <fuscello> Just gutting hog for the time being could have been a choice as well
[2022-12-23 21:24:10] <+willskills3009> Less cc
[2022-12-23 21:24:20] <%geen_naamnl> How to solve it ? Have lower ranks play on a different balance patch. And let the higher ranks play on their own patch :)
[2022-12-23 21:24:27] <+J_Faust> If you get shot in the head with an arrow, you would die. If we want more then one character one shotting and being viable, we cant complain
[2022-12-23 21:24:34] <Pixel_Gobelin> They should remove his shuriken, those things are pointy and dangerous
[2022-12-23 21:24:40] <doomfish25> @FireBadLuck Meanwhile been working in the weather outside.... hypothermia been a concern.

[2022-12-23 21:24:44] <+GoIdenRule> @Choachy That would be silly, he would just be a much worse Ashe and she ain't stellar right now
[2022-12-23 21:24:45] <gags123> Correct. It's quite annoying in Dia +
[2022-12-23 21:24:46] <makkert79> Balancing in this game will be always hard as you have to both balance Floor (most players) as Ceiling (high rank players)
[2022-12-23 21:24:54] <@%^StreamElements> Check out Flats' YouTube channel! https://www.youtube.com/@flats_ow | Most Recent Video: NANO Ramattra needs to CALM DOWN - https://youtu.be/6-1Be8cFQjU
[2022-12-23 21:24:55] <+HueyLewisFan> i think the balance issues aren't gamebreaking but are compounded by weird matchmaking that puts people against players well outside their own skill bracket
[2022-12-23 21:25:00] <%FireBadLuck> @FireBadLuck That's between you and your employer
[2022-12-23 21:25:09] <%sammcrank> @geen_naamnl then at what point is the line? and if that happens you need to relearn strategies and playstyles
[2022-12-23 21:25:37] <%FireBadLuck> The argument of, "I had it worst, so everyone must have it worst." is always a flimsy
[2022-12-23 21:25:39] <DeciusCorvinus> at lower ranks which lets be real 90% of us are in I think only hog is a problem. all other heroes are fine since most can't optimize playing them. Ppl who complain about balance when they are gold are just upset they don't win 80% of their games and need to be more realistic about themselves as players.
[2022-12-23 21:25:50] <ltz_Boo> Matchmaking over balance anyday
[2022-12-23 21:25:59] <doomfish25> Anyway, Survivorship Bias should be top of mind.
[2022-12-23 21:26:03] <%+CheekyGreeky> @DeciusCorvinus THIS
[2022-12-23 21:26:05] <vegito_shadow> @DeciusCorvinus straight facts
[2022-12-23 21:26:09] <ltz_Boo> Wits over stats
[2022-12-23 21:26:11] <+J_Faust> If chat had their way, every hero would do one damage per shot, move the exact same speed, and everyone had 500 health
[2022-12-23 21:26:18] <procyonnova> so they should balance for Diamond-Master players
[2022-12-23 21:26:24] <blackroz8> like widow
[2022-12-23 21:26:25] <+Mike2621> I don’t want more than one character one shooting most should not especially not spam hero’s give Hanzo trick arrows like Green Areow or Hawkeye instead
[2022-12-23 21:26:25] <tipmeoverandpourmeout> disable sojourn at Masters and above :)
[2022-12-23 21:26:29] <xearaoh> I'm a new player and I think she need a nerf
[2022-12-23 21:26:33] <gags123> It's the brig situation all over again

[2022-12-23 21:26:46] <Pixel_Gobelin> to balance balance itself dont look easy at all in a game with that many characters to be fair.
[2022-12-23 21:26:51] <%paddingtonnnn> we don't want her either tho
[2022-12-23 21:26:59] <+Gamer_RZX> they should get nerf genji so he has no dash no deflect 5 hp and has a chance to trip over and die when climbing walls, right guys???
[2022-12-23 21:27:01] <%paddingtonnnn> she's not fun to play into
[2022-12-23 21:27:01] <ltz_Boo> Yeah at that levels most players are thinking strategically the same
[2022-12-23 21:27:06] <%MADcees> YUP
[2022-12-23 21:27:07] <+MCKOOKIE_> 76 is easier value than sojourn lower levels
[2022-12-23 21:27:10] <%FireBadLuck> In my heart, I want no vertical mobility in the game. But I know that will make overwatch not overwatch no more.

[2022-12-23 21:27:45] <+GoIdenRule> @Mike2621 Hanzo already has "trick" arrows. One gives him wallhacks and the other gives him a machine gun. What else could you give him to make up the loss of the 1-shot
[2022-12-23 21:27:46] <%FireBadLuck> QP warriors ftw
[2022-12-23 21:27:47] <makkert79> No rein is meh in low ranks too
[2022-12-23 21:27:48] <%geen_naamnl> @sammcrank I think plat and up perhaps . I don't mean major changes . Just the minor changes like low elo plays with a uhmmmm ''normal?'' Sojourn and let the higher elo players play with an actually nerfed sojourn. And I think over time you will learn the mechanics of a hero and it doesnt matter to much when they start playing in the other patch :)
[2022-12-23 21:27:56] <%djzander_> @amr183 kekw
[2022-12-23 21:28:08] <vegito_shadow> the problem is that in upper ranks they are able to get the real value while lower ranks can't so i feel like that maks it kinka imbalanced imo
[2022-12-23 21:28:16] <bobhog> i feel like devs down care they make low skill heroes with high value like junkrat
[2022-12-23 21:28:40] <bobhog> yes im low rank
[2022-12-23 21:28:40] <+MCKOOKIE_> Junk dominates sub diamond
[2022-12-23 21:28:43] <Pixel_Gobelin> would a ''scalling balance'' an viable or doable idea?

[2022-12-23 21:29:00] <%sammcrank> @geen_naamnl so then can Plat and diamond not play together? like yes it's an idea but there's also alot of questions that need answers
[2022-12-23 21:29:08] <%$ArchAngel_J10> For me personally I’m a very competitive person in nature playing sports my whole life, and not having a SR number to grind (physically seeing my progress on a game to game basis) is really lame and It doesn’t feel very competitive and really lame. I want a metal rank visible in the lobby to show off and etc. I want the SR back.
[2022-12-23 21:29:12] <blackroz8> like orisa
[2022-12-23 21:29:20] <%EmpoweredWhiskey> pls, i beg you guys, talk to smn who’s below diamond jsut once n they will tell you sojourn is an issue down here too. this is a bs excuse of the devs
[2022-12-23 21:29:22] <+dookiedetector44> Tubby

[2022-12-23 21:29:35] <johnjamisonn> I think games should balance to the highest level, because lower level players will learn to adjust by watching better players
[2022-12-23 21:29:36] <+N3o___> Thing what i dont understand is, how are people this pressed about sojourn when widow has been in the game since the start.
[2022-12-23 21:29:37] <LOOKupMS> bcuz the devs werent stupid then lol

[2022-12-23 21:29:59] <LaDANTE00> Pick and ban is really good option to explore now, I think.
[2022-12-23 21:30:01] <ltz_Boo> Definitely should have a tower of balance each tier has different nerfs and buffs into each rank
[2022-12-23 21:30:03] <e_coli37> Fr. Even gold sojourns do way too much. Her damage and abilities are not negligible.
[2022-12-23 21:30:08] <+Mike2621> @goidenrule arrows that inflict burn/bleed/slow electric damage that damages multiple enemies like Winston
[2022-12-23 21:30:11] <+nutELinda> Souj needs a movement penalty tbh that's really it
[2022-12-23 21:30:14] <bazingapilled> KEKW theres always been shitty teammates, just look at bf2 on pc back in the day
[2022-12-23 21:30:18] <xearaoh> Whats tf2
[2022-12-23 21:30:20] <Pixel_Gobelin> Comunication and retroaction with the player base is the real thing that need balance the most
[2022-12-23 21:30:23] <%geen_naamnl> @sammcrank Indeed , would make matchmaking a bit better as well , didnt think of that. Like they said if you buff a hero for lower elo it will be OP in higher elo vice versa.

[2022-12-23 21:37:51] <%djzander_> @bobhog the negative is that your contributing nothing else to ur team, no healing, less dmg then dps and many other supports

[2022-12-23 21:43:20] <johnjamisonn> also to add on that. by making orisa more viable you've now slowed the meta and made ana and zen more viable as well

[2022-12-23 21:49:31] <deepflex52> @zenpunk I absolutely agree
[2022-12-23 21:49:46] <alwayswizzin> I have a good change to hog that could be nice, remove the hook, remove the heal. Instead of healing with his skill he could absorb the damage received during the skill period and then after the skill is over he in returns sends all projectiles shot at him back out. There’s not really any hero with that ability(besides genji deflect) but more then just reflecting it back, he absorbs it first. Was just a though ^_^

[2022-12-23 21:51:34] <Pixel_Gobelin> How I see a raingun is that its should pierce target more than do massive damage. Like lower damage on one target but have it go throught barriere, ennemies etc

I am however considered the "balance target" for being on the lower end. I however, would stop playing this game and work towards the top, if the competative scene dies. Its just not fun to work towards the clear impressive top, if there is none and it becomes casual. I cant be the only one.

[2022-12-23 21:52:57] <@%chompchomp8> I think blizzard could really use better tutorials
[2022-12-23 21:53:01] <@%chompchomp8> for new players
[2022-12-23 21:53:06] <%sofishdekat> YEP
[2022-12-23 21:53:12] <%+amr183> @chompchomp8 YES
[2022-12-23 21:53:13] <alwayswizzin> @ltz_boo No hook at all, skill would be removed completely!
[2022-12-23 21:53:17] <%bluedahlias> @chompchomp8 agreeeeeee
[2022-12-23 21:53:18] <@%chompchomp8> this game pretty much relies on watching other people to learn the game and get better
[2022-12-23 21:53:20] <%+kazenblade29> The soldier tutorial is...ok at best but not great
[2022-12-23 21:53:24] <+N3o___> trying to teach your friend how to play overwatch really shows how confusing the game is
[2022-12-23 21:53:25] <Axiomish> just ban all bronze.  problem solved
[2022-12-23 21:53:26] <@%chompchomp8> no way to discover yourself in game
[2022-12-23 21:53:33] <+dontdoxans_> trash take
[2022-12-23 21:53:39] <Yumakaze> Imo, every season should've had a new playable character, would keep things fresh.
[2022-12-23 21:53:41] <alwayswizzin> Or maybe hog could get the hook after absorbing x amount of dmg
[2022-12-23 21:53:46] <+Gamer_RZX> @chompchomp8 reminds me of the league situation
[2022-12-23 21:53:57] <brekfastking> awful take
[2022-12-23 21:54:00] <ltz_Boo> Oooo yeah that’d work make a requirement
[2022-12-23 21:54:04] <Pixel_Gobelin> the hook feel too much attached to the character identity I think to be removed
[2022-12-23 21:54:08] <Outta_Pocket> @chompchomp8 thats how every game with a skill cap is, valorant csgo rust ect.
[2022-12-23 21:54:10] <aladinsane25> Remove every hero except Ball, balance is saved
[2022-12-23 21:54:11] <blackroz8> ppl hate new charcater beeing good

[2022-12-23 21:54:20] <%+kazenblade29> It's like removing bastion minigun

[2022-12-23 21:54:37] <The_Zoozibble> what about charging up the hook, and the distance is based on how long you charged
[2022-12-23 21:54:46] <The_Noob_Police> bastion sucks facing low ranks

[2022-12-23 21:57:06] <alwayswizzin> @the_zoozibble Nah can’t change hook. Hook has to be instant because it’s all about timing, and hitting the right timing while charging would be almost impossible. Needs to be reworked to make hook only available while in ULT, or something built up, kind of like sojourns rail gun
[2022-12-23 21:57:07] <kaito_vnx> rammatra is a nightmare for rein
[2022-12-23 21:57:07] <ltz_Boo> The ult definitely makes us retreat but not too too powerful
[2022-12-23 21:57:11] <brekfastking> orisa needs 2 sec added to javelin change my mind

[2022-12-23 22:11:56] <+J_Faust> @Axiomish So you are a dps main, understood. Your job is to only do damage.
[2022-12-23 22:12:02] <%+kazenblade29> 50% damage reduction would make him a just have.
[2022-12-23 22:12:05] <TrustedTerror45> @n3o___  the only thing I’d maybe change with him is lowering the pull down cooldown just a little but not by much imo
[2022-12-23 22:12:05] <alwayswizzin> @oostar_dustoo Don’t listen to tank players, they won’t ever understand ^_^

[2022-12-23 22:19:58] <hatskan> in the pve you should get to choses a part of the roster you unlocked in a replay
[2022-12-23 22:20:00] <+chorklit> i bet they haven't touched PVE since they gave us that demo years ago
[2022-12-23 22:20:01] <%+Raptorgod_> @brekfastking He is the most broken tank in high play he can hide and one shot 4 members of your team and has breather if he gets caught out
[2022-12-23 22:20:01] <Tenth_Shadow> @brekfastking he a powerful hero and hard to kills if you have not seen a good hog its super annoying killing him IF you can kill him
[2022-12-23 22:20:10] <ooStar_Dustoo> @psycho_pirate agreed they sucked the life from it very generic not fepth and darkness first 2 were so iconic for

[2022-12-23 22:20:41] <brekfastking> losing to hog sounds like skill issue ngl
[2022-12-23 22:20:46] <tipmeoverandpourmeout> WOW2, as in World of Overwatch 2
[2022-12-23 22:20:53] <Yumakaze> i just don't see it being replayable without mods, Left 4 Dead which is a wave-based PVE game is only popular because of mods
[2022-12-23 22:20:57] <%N30NxL1T3x> imagine if we were still waiting for ow2 to release because of pve
[2022-12-23 22:20:58] <MotorByte> Didn't they show PvE footage? It looked pretty well along

[2022-12-23 22:22:03] <+Mike2621> Except the Devs said “Campaign map” in their stream this week so pve is 100% going to be at the very least a Full Campaign

[2022-12-23 22:22:54] <%blueberrybench> @MotorByte you can throw that out the window sense it is about 2 year old

[2022-12-23 22:29:37] <bhunerbombs> and for crying out loud,lets us see ranks and mmr i dont get why they took that away
[2022-12-23 22:29:39] <+Enonchong> Exactly - Hammond needs 3 guns
[2022-12-23 22:29:43] <%rubypt2> hammond with extra gun is actually based
[2022-12-23 22:29:44] <Yumakaze> Overwatch Destiny would be sick
[2022-12-23 22:29:44] <procyonnova> overwatch but it's an anime
[2022-12-23 22:29:50] <1classynative> just make 50 new heros and actually do something cool...this is all low tier trash in my opinions
[2022-12-23 22:29:54] <@%chompchomp8> I think seagull thinks it would be like destiny
[2022-12-23 22:29:54] <soord_n_boord> @bhunerbombs to be fair you could never see MMR
[2022-12-23 22:29:57] <ltz_Boo> @bhunerbombs factssss

[2022-12-23 22:30:00] <faithfulj> destiny is trash
[2022-12-23 22:30:03] <%slaum00> god i hope ow dosent turn into destiny
[2022-12-23 22:30:03] <%+kazenblade29> So your saying we have to wait 4 more years for PVE?
[2022-12-23 22:30:03] <%+lazorbheemz> @bhunerbombs takes away the mystery

[2022-12-23 22:30:36] <ihave2023visionfearme> just take a look at the recent blizzard releases, diablo 4 is now at mercy of the greedy monetization
[2022-12-23 22:30:43] <%sammcrank> @bhunerbombs okay YEP makes sense
[2022-12-23 22:30:46] <%+kazenblade29> PVE quadruple Exp
[2022-12-23 22:30:48] <%$TeaHauss> FeelsStrongMan my strimmers rank 1
[2022-12-23 22:30:57] <%$atsBrew> FeelsStrongMan
[2022-12-23 22:31:04] <ltz_Boo> Makes the game a lil easier to rank up
[2022-12-23 22:31:07] <bhunerbombs> like if i play 10 games...go 7-3 and play super well in those 7 wins ..in no way should i demote or stay the same rank
[2022-12-23 22:31:09] <%+lazorbheemz> @ihave2023visionfearme thats that phone game right?

[2022-12-23 22:31:15] <ForsakenAgony> Destiny 2 is nothing like it used to be. It's gotten worse over the years and last season was one of the least populated seasons.
[2022-12-23 22:31:17] <ltz_Boo> Always guessing and tryharding
[2022-12-23 22:31:19] <1classynative> when you play this game for a couple months and then you stop playing...did you actually gain anything? or did you just play a game
[2022-12-23 22:31:31] <%+Choocharoo> Orignally it was a Wow replacement...and that went away and thus OW was created. I dont think they ever cirlced back on this being a WoW lvl pve game. Not remotely close imo
[2022-12-23 22:31:34] <marrushann> the lore is kinda all over the place
[2022-12-23 22:31:35] <%+TheIceMan9304> do you guys eat doritos?
[2022-12-23 22:31:36] <+tatersalad63> I'm actually super pumped for some kind of actual story. So they can apply shit to the lore that they've been piecing together over the years.
[2022-12-23 22:31:38] <Yumakaze> @kazenblade29 Bruh, ppl are still waiting for Star Citizen, people are most certainly gonna wait lmao
[2022-12-23 22:31:38] <%slaum00> @1classynative played a game
[2022-12-23 22:31:41] <procyonnova> netflix OW series when?
[2022-12-23 22:31:43] <%Elidest> @ForsakenAgony destiny 2 is terrible rn i feel so bad playing it. It makes me sad
[2022-12-23 22:31:46] <ihave2023visionfearme> @lazorbheemz that was diablo immortal, and seeing how that game turned out, it's pretty safe to assume how diablo 4 will turn out
[2022-12-23 22:31:48] <%+kazenblade29> Over watch story mode Binge?
[2022-12-23 22:32:01] <MotorByte> @ForsakenAgony Really? Why is it doing poorly? I was under the impression that game was doing better
[2022-12-23 22:32:05] <%N30NxL1T3x> what was before netflix emongHmm
[2022-12-23 22:32:12] <%slaum00> @1classynative i see what youre saying but i feel like thats why ow is great
[2022-12-23 22:32:17] <kidpresident0> 😩
[2022-12-23 22:32:24] <ooStar_Dustoo> ppl play the crap out of it and then are bored in a few weeks

[2022-12-23 22:32:31] <%+kazenblade29> Anyone remember block Buster? 🤣🤣😂🤣😂😂
[2022-12-23 22:32:37] <+ayamirr> PVE will only be fun if there is good REPLAYABILITY in it which is why I keep insisting with Vermintide 2 Blizzard should learn from this game if they want the PVE to survive and not die after playing all the missions available

[2022-12-23 22:32:52] <Jerkreb> nah
[2022-12-23 22:32:52] <+tatersalad63> I'm trying to figure out what little kid from what show seagull looks like
[2022-12-23 22:32:52] <ihave2023visionfearme> it should be like that, games shouldn't be released in a god awful bug ridden mess, compare that to old game where you couldn't just update it, you HAD to make sure it was 100% good to go
[2022-12-23 22:32:54] <bhunerbombs> we also need season bans as a punishment for throwers imo

[2022-12-23 22:34:16] <bhunerbombs> all brand new players should have to get 150 wins before they play ranked...not what it is at
[2022-12-23 22:34:18] <1classynative> lol watching ads does helps flats indirectly...i know it blows but it def helps if you can't sub

[2022-12-23 22:35:19] <0werwatch> hiiiiiii
[2022-12-23 22:35:24] <Yumakaze> Remember when companies released finished games instead of charging for 20%-20%-20% Aware
[2022-12-23 22:35:25] <bobhog> ironically enough bungie is snatching up talent from the overwatch team and Valorants old game director
[2022-12-23 22:35:30] <%+kazenblade29> Can't see myself playing that solo
[2022-12-23 22:35:31] <bhunerbombs> @BlurryFace79 naw..its insane that new players get 50 wins then go in ranked are allowed to int games due to thier lack of knowing what to do

[2022-12-23 22:36:43] <ltz_Boo> It’ll definitely be nice multiplayer campaign would be nice drop in/out
[2022-12-23 22:36:45] <+chronovan_> destiny has got really good at having big story beats in their seasons but it took many years to get their
[2022-12-23 22:36:46] <%Toddlesworth> Corpa wtf when am i allowed to go on 9 wk vacation
[2022-12-23 22:36:48] <%+kazenblade29> I feel like the only thing you should pay for in PVE is the Quick rank up skill tree
[2022-12-23 22:36:49] <MySecretKingdom> @chaddeusmaximus yeah it kinda hurts my ears ):
[2022-12-23 22:36:52] <%slaum00> id play it
[2022-12-23 22:36:52] <bobhog> witch queen was great and the seasons flow well into the yearly expansion for destiny 2
[2022-12-23 22:37:00] <%+kazenblade29> For people who just want to use the abilities and not grind just pay for it that way.
[2022-12-23 22:37:02] <BlurryFace79> @bhunerbombs Brother if your getting into RANKED games with brand new players, that’s actually just a skill issue
[2022-12-23 22:37:08] <bobhog> its really a free to try game not full on free to play
[2022-12-23 22:37:16] <+Karhmuh> how can we expect blizzard to balance the main game and pve

[2022-12-23 22:37:23] <Zaddy85> they need more maps in multiplayer
[2022-12-23 22:37:38] <+chronovan_> destiny community is constantly at odds. some prefer the drip feed, some the big drops where you can no-life it for a while then move on
[2022-12-23 22:37:43] <bhunerbombs> @BlurryFace79 pure copium bud and actually the dumbest thing ive read all day, you realize that the avarage new account is placed arround gold right?

[2022-12-23 22:38:10] <Arkham_Stein> My only grievance with destiny 2 would be just how grindy the seasonal elements are.  i play essentially  the same grind that isnt going to be fixed until deep deep in to 2023
[2022-12-23 22:38:19] <ForsakenAgony> @Elidest I have over 4k playing hours and I used to get every triumph and seal in the game. Now, I barley even play the game anymore. I think one of the biggest issues in the game is the leveling system.. and another problem is just reskinning everything and say it's new content. Doing bounties is so boring.. Don't even get me started on that shit. They killed off PvP when they added this in air accuracy.. on top of that They added 1 MAP IN 1,100 DAYS IN PVP! So many issues in D2 to talk about.
[2022-12-23 22:38:27] <%+kazenblade29> I agree with flats and the dude in the top right the most so far
[2022-12-23 22:38:29] <bhunerbombs> @flyingfish1230 bro what? were having a discussion lol wtf

[2022-12-23 22:38:51] <%Toddlesworth> Corpa feed them another morsel, it's been 9 weeks
[2022-12-23 22:38:56] <%slaum00> fuck yea @flats, i was a wow player for years and if Blizz is involved "the money is the motive"
[2022-12-23 22:38:57] <+chronovan_> yeah the season grind is so played out. The arbitrary power level just to do content. Looking like they may drop the power increases outside of annual expansions.

[2022-12-23 22:40:02] <@%flyingfish1230> @bhunerbombs yalls messages were getting a wee bit aggressive for a conversation

[2022-12-23 22:40:19] <%TheTealPhoenix> There constant new small “story” thing that you can crank out in 30 minutes is the destiny model currently. Sometimes you get a banger season but I’ve played destiny since day 1 and I much prefer expansion
[2022-12-23 22:40:31] <+chronovan_> Destiny and genshin impact have some of the best drip feed in the industry. its hard to get it right

[2022-12-23 22:41:34] <+chronovan_> these days I prefer to get the big drop of content so I can play the hell out of it, and then move on to other games.
[2022-12-23 22:41:35] <bhunerbombs> you should earn battlepass level ups for doing pve
[2022-12-23 22:41:49] <+reivec> If they put PVE in the battle pass then it would make sense to drop large PVE missions when there are no new heroes
[2022-12-23 22:41:53] <%Toddlesworth> @QtDivinity i dont and am not going to play genshin LUL
[2022-12-23 22:41:57] <%slaum00> @Toddlesworth yea no i would be pissed but im a grinder some players may not make the progress as fast
[2022-12-23 22:42:00] <%TheTealPhoenix> Also destiny is not F2P per say, it has minimal content that you have to pay for all the major expansions. The “free” content in destiny is some of the worst content in the game
[2022-12-23 22:42:06] <ltz_Boo> @bhunerbombs that’s what I’m thinking to it’d help the game and bring focus to pve
[2022-12-23 22:42:14] <%FireBadLuck> I want PVE, so I can switch between PVP and PVE. So if I get sick of one, I can swap to the other
[2022-12-23 22:42:21] <ez305pz> OMEGALUL
[2022-12-23 22:42:22] <+QtDivinity> @Toddlesworth you just stated pve games die when they do that
[2022-12-23 22:42:33] <+QtDivinity> when it's exactly genshins model to my understanding

[2022-12-23 22:42:46] <+chronovan_> @TheTealPhoenix its really not bad for new players. To veterans its lame and old but if your new its a great amount of stuff to do before you have to worry about expansions

[2022-12-23 22:43:52] <%+icanhazlazers> Thought is: Big launch that is paid, seannal content in BP, and then another big launch of the next campaign which is paid again imo

[2022-12-23 22:44:29] <%FireBadLuck> If we can do hero bans where each side can ban any 2 heroes. Would be pretty nice. Basically like Rainbow Six Siege
[2022-12-23 22:44:35] <+jaxinsux> thats because they have resale value and you can also get your money back
[2022-12-23 22:44:37] <+chronovan_> as a 8 year destiny player im SUPER excited for OW2 PvE. I think it can be a great competitor to destiny.

[2022-12-23 22:45:33] <ExoduneTV> me coming from cs, i think the prices in ow2 were "ok"
[2022-12-23 22:45:36] <TrustedTerror45> I think the battle pass is worth it. However i think it’s bs that they can’t be bothered to give you any premium currency throughout the battle pass like with most other games
[2022-12-23 22:46:01] <oRwryan> i really thought they were releasing the PvE as a full 60$ thing and call it ???
[2022-12-23 22:46:11] <Claytod> I personally dislike the battle pass, strictly because it's a crap deal for f2p players. There's not much motive to grind it outside of getting the new character.
[2022-12-23 22:46:15] <oRwryan> wtf?
[2022-12-23 22:46:15] <+chronovan_> @TrustedTerror45 very true. pretty much every other game with a BP gives you the currency throughout the pass
[2022-12-23 22:46:28] <+ns1ayer> @oRwryan if they keep doing what they are doing rn the pve will be DOA
[2022-12-23 22:46:38] <%+kazenblade29> Heroes should never be in the bass
[2022-12-23 22:46:43] <bobhog> fornite has the best battlepass and experience for gaining XP, OW2 should take notes

[2022-12-23 22:48:00] <bobhog> its $7.99 for a battle pass with so much to gain its insane
[2022-12-23 22:48:02] <oRwryan> i hope they don't pull a Diablo Immortal
[2022-12-23 22:48:07] <Fallen_angel310> I think they're gonna do it like Fornite Save The World. STW has daily mission that can give you v-bucks

[2022-12-23 22:49:31] <+chronovan_> after diablo immortal I dont think they could make the bad monetization work. People would boycott
[2022-12-23 22:49:33] <Yumakaze> How about they do a combined expansion pack with both PVE and PVP, have once a year / once every other year be a HUGE drop of content for both games with drip feed inbetween
[2022-12-23 22:49:45] <tetro_hexual> pve wont be f2p
[2022-12-23 22:49:52] <ihave2023visionfearme> can we stop setting games with overpriced cosmetics as a standard ?
[2022-12-23 22:49:58] <%$atsBrew> another idea would be getting something like a "season pass"
[2022-12-23 22:50:04] <ltz_Boo> Sounds pretty good @yumakaze
[2022-12-23 22:50:08] <+chronovan_> very true. Most people only come back for the annual expansions in Destiny
[2022-12-23 22:50:11] <%+Choocharoo> They are not gonna add in a 50-70 expac on a free to play game imo. They moved OW from paid up front to a f2p game..and now they might just say lets have 3 editions of a big drop pve? I dont see it..Gotta be more like 20 dollar drops here and there.
[2022-12-23 22:50:17] <ltz_Boo> Facts way too expensive
[2022-12-23 22:50:18] <TrustedTerror45> @yumakaze agreed that sounds pretty decent honestly

[2022-12-23 22:50:48] <brekfastking> game gonna get killed by greed lol
[2022-12-23 22:50:51] <bobhog> so 60 bucks a year
[2022-12-23 22:50:56] <ForsakenAgony> @flyingfish1230 Is he currently working for them or was this in the past? Because the old system where they added everything all in one year was amazing. The best years in Destiny history was Taken King and Rise of Iron and both of those had the old system. Instead of giving us bread crumbs every week. You get 15-30mins of content every week is kinda.. not the greatest.
[2022-12-23 22:51:00] <+chronovan_> i can totally see them going the Destiny route. its proven to work, and it took bungie years to get it where it is now. lots of fails along the way
[2022-12-23 22:51:00] <bobhog> price of full priced game but drip fed
[2022-12-23 22:51:02] <+ns1ayer> i think Seagull laugh is the answer everyone need
[2022-12-23 22:51:06] <RYANREIGN> i think may will not bother with it unles its all part of the BP
[2022-12-23 22:51:12] <Yumakaze> Treat OW PVE and PVP as one product, use the MMO model of one big expansion and big patches inbetween that adds big content to both

[2022-12-23 22:57:17] <ForsakenAgony> @flyingfish1230 Ohh, gotcha. I mean I'm just one person from D2 community. But, I think I speak for quite a bit of people. Probably not the majority?.. Because I think D2 is catering to the casuals nowadays.. and I see a lot of games doing that. Some games do work in that system. But, for a game like D2 to where quite of bit of the community is hardcore grinders.. It's not really that anymore. And if there is something to grind and it's most likely a grind for a reskin of a reskin weapon/armor.
[2022-12-23 22:57:18] <bhunerbombs> @CaptainSparkyLive because league has a horrible client and its not worth dealing with..also leagues event pass's are awfull
[2022-12-23 22:57:19] <Yumakaze> Loot boxes for leveling up should be fine imo
[2022-12-23 22:57:26] <DIGITMERC> oh hey sup flats chat and @Flats
[2022-12-23 22:57:36] <Yumakaze> But that does mean they have to bring back a leveling system
[2022-12-23 22:57:39] <+chronovan_> @MangoTreeFarming lol never thought there would be a day where we miss loot boxes...but it has happened KEKW
[2022-12-23 22:57:39] <%CassiHikari> Sup my man
[2022-12-23 22:57:40] <%CaptainSparkyLive> @bhunerbombs but it has been shown to work
[2022-12-23 22:57:49] <Yumakaze> Or make it a form of daily thing like you do in gacha games
[2022-12-23 22:57:59] <+ns1ayer> their pricing on skins is completely out of touch not only with their playerbase but with real life marketing basics.
[2022-12-23 22:58:17] <zookiiiii> please don't normalise £20 skins
[2022-12-23 22:58:22] <%wasabiroot> @ns1ayer yep, it's essentially as high as they can get away with until pitchforks
[2022-12-23 22:58:24] <alwayswizzin> Still going strong I see!
[2022-12-23 22:58:26] <%SkitzoCTRL> @ns1ayer Seems the same as Valorant.
[2022-12-23 22:58:30] <Axiomish> used to being scammed
[2022-12-23 22:58:33] <Axiomish> interesting
[2022-12-23 22:58:36] <ItsKatsuragi> it's also it of touch with their own game.
[2022-12-23 22:58:38] <+chronovan_> 60 coins a week POGGIES
[2022-12-23 22:58:38] <peace_duke_69> $20 skins is okay YEP

[2022-12-23 22:58:55] <brekfastking> 1 skin $20 hahahha
[2022-12-23 22:58:58] <ihave2023visionfearme> being normalized to scummy methods, wonderful
[2022-12-23 22:59:02] <dumbdummm> Hallo
[2022-12-23 22:59:07] <zookiiiii> actually gaslighting ourselves yep £20 for a skin is normal haha
[2022-12-23 22:59:11] <+Mike2621> Y’all say it’s out of touch but if the prices don’t drop it because people are paying for it and that’s all they care about
[2022-12-23 22:59:13] <DIGITMERC> @chronovan_ or 50 if only 2 roles. :D
[2022-12-23 22:59:14] <+ns1ayer> i'm pretty sure they will sell way more skins if priced with common sense

[2022-12-23 22:59:18] <bobhog> if they are going to charge 20 bucks for a skin it better change sound fx as well as visuals
[2022-12-23 22:59:18] <Axiomish> fun fact.  enite games cost $20.  true story
[2022-12-23 22:59:21] <%N30NxL1T3x> o bucks
[2022-12-23 22:59:32] <milhouse7> thousands for a CSGO skin is fine because everyone has a chance to get it for only the price of case and key ???
[2022-12-23 22:59:37] <%+amr183> AND IT WOULD ALSO MAKE PEOPLE ACTUALLY PLAY THE GAME IF YOU MAKE PEOPLE WORK FOR THEIR COINS????
[2022-12-23 22:59:44] <bhunerbombs> @peace_duke_69 play valorant.. then u will see what bad skin prices is
[2022-12-23 22:59:44] <milhouse7> not 20 skin with a 2 dollar value
[2022-12-23 22:59:52] <brekfastking> Overwatch used to sell for $20 lmao
[2022-12-23 22:59:58] <%SkitzoCTRL> I haven't nor will I ever spend anything on this game. I'll earn my coins through Bing and Weeklies and that's it.
[2022-12-23 23:00:00] <%iliketoeatpineapples> you know the best thing league of legends has when season ends? when you reach a certain rank, RIOT gives you a cool skins for a particular hero. can't remember what else but it is pretty fulfilling to receive that free skin
[2022-12-23 23:00:13] <+ns1ayer> @SkitzoCTRL you can't really compare valorant to ow in terms of marketing
[2022-12-23 23:00:13] <warmonkey999> Add lootboxs to the battle pass simple
[2022-12-23 23:00:20] <%CaptainSparkyLive> at the end of the day none of the content you're paying for is game changing, except for the heroes being locked behind a grind or $10 you don't need skins to play a completely free game
[2022-12-23 23:00:27] <%SkitzoCTRL> @ns1ayer Cool story but I just did.
[2022-12-23 23:00:31] <Axiomish> lootboxes are illegal everywhere
[2022-12-23 23:00:39] <%ow_sigmaeats> KEKW
[2022-12-23 23:00:41] <xxwarxx> No forget that feed crap to the whales and give me more stuff for free
[2022-12-23 23:00:47] <xxwarxx> Win win
[2022-12-23 23:00:51] <+BubbaDaBuddha> If you get 10% of the people to spend $20 on a skin, but you only get 15% that will buy the skin for $10......then they are gonna make more money buy charging more
[2022-12-23 23:00:53] <+zenpunk> Agree... skins should be like a buck... legendary and mythic like 3 and 5 bucks, respectively.  Everyone would have been buying tons.  As is now, they're so ridiculously overpriced that people don't buy them because it would make you feel foolish for doing so.

[2022-12-23 23:01:27] <+ns1ayer> @SkitzoCTRL i'm not saying that valorant skins are fairly priced but valorant started in a different way.
[2022-12-23 23:01:40] <xxwarxx> Why would I care if some dork wants to run around in a $300 skin, I’d just look at that as thanks you just bought me some more free PvE
[2022-12-23 23:01:54] <Silent_DC> great take
[2022-12-23 23:01:56] <SadMatte> Seagull is so based wow
[2022-12-23 23:02:00] <acidicpure> Ironically streamers are often ones who vocally complain about it on a platform but then you see they've bought the skins LUL
[2022-12-23 23:02:23] <xxwarxx> Feed the whales cosmetics and give us new maps characters and PvE for free
[2022-12-23 23:02:28] <+chronovan_> Sadge Years ago I would of never even spent $5 for a skin. Now other games have desensitized me and I buy them here and there Sadge
[2022-12-23 23:02:28] <%SkitzoCTRL> @acidicpure And?...
[2022-12-23 23:02:29] <%slaum00> let people spend on shiny as long as it dosent effect gameplay
[2022-12-23 23:02:36] <Yumakaze> My friend was able to get all the skins she wanted in OW1 because she played enough and got enough points, now she cant even get a single skin she wants lmao
[2022-12-23 23:02:39] <Yumakaze> All F2P
[2022-12-23 23:02:41] <SadMatte> @acidicpure most only buy the bp and a couple skins they really like
[2022-12-23 23:02:43] <%iliketoeatpineapples> in a heavily hero switch FPS game, getting a new hero behind a paywall truly feels funky
[2022-12-23 23:02:47] <%wasabiroot> yeah that was cringe
[2022-12-23 23:02:47] <+chronovan_> the old skins being same price is Super scummy
[2022-12-23 23:02:53] <+schmidt55> THAT right there
[2022-12-23 23:03:09] <Silent_DC> all skins from ow1 should have been f2p accessible

[2022-12-23 23:03:19] <bobhog> oh fun an ad when flats gets to talk
[2022-12-23 23:03:21] <+Jotaro_Northstar> worst thing new stuff coming out already reduced like there´s been a price before that´s nuts
[2022-12-23 23:03:24] <+chronovan_> if the skins were like $5, tops $10 I would buy them so much more.
[2022-12-23 23:03:24] <choinnich> POV: You don’t want to play overwatch, but, listening to people discuss it’s issues is the rather entertaining.
[2022-12-23 23:03:37] <Zaddy85> 5 ads lol
[2022-12-23 23:03:38] <hometortoise> @flats we had an AD. May you recap what you just said?
[2022-12-23 23:03:38] <%+icanhazlazers> I think the only other thing is that the BP "season" skins are far too often in the SHop over the BP
[2022-12-23 23:03:45] <+Amarine_> old skins being "rewards" also like twitch drops
[2022-12-23 23:03:53] <procyonnova> when you do podcasts like this, you need to turn off ads
[2022-12-23 23:03:57] <%VodkaKid97> CS is controlled by the market, NOT the devs

[2022-12-23 23:04:08] <+zenpunk> I know, right.  I def lost a bit of respect for the Moira streamer I watch when I saw them with the $17 Moira mime skin.  Took like 7 subs to pay for that hat... lol.

[2022-12-23 23:04:13] <%VodkaKid97> And you can sell skins and get money, they even increase in value sometimes

[2022-12-23 23:11:46] <+ocd_game> @itskatsuragi but no cross core in halo so almost all battle passes aren’t worth buying because I can’t use my stuff
[2022-12-23 23:11:51] <+chronovan_> yeah the halo BP being permanent is dope... but when I was playing at launch it needed to be that way because it took ages to get any progression KEKW

[2022-12-23 23:12:18] <fall_senseless> destiny is shit
[2022-12-23 23:12:35] <fall_senseless> not hard to compete with it tbh

[2022-12-23 23:12:43] <%$iiStreekzZ> So is halo
[2022-12-23 23:12:49] <+chronovan_> destiny is not shit. it was at D2 launch but that was in 2017
[2022-12-23 23:12:56] <+cl0ud_dealer> Only available in bundle
[2022-12-23 23:12:56] <+hamslam95> Bastion skin for 1 coin is the run KEKW
[2022-12-23 23:12:56] <%oldchappy> I honestly think they'd sell more skins if they dropped everything in cost.

[2022-12-23 23:13:00] <%$BodyOdor> People need to stop comparing to Fortnite. It’s impossible to compete with their battle pass and all the deals they have signed
[2022-12-23 23:13:05] <+ocd_game> Only good thing about halo is forge
[2022-12-23 23:13:08] <+ns1ayer> total scam KEKW

[2022-12-23 23:13:32] <%+aibinauric_> @oldchappy more skins? Definitely. Will they make more money though?

[2022-12-23 23:14:55] <+chronovan_> @fall_senseless I know it very well. the season model has grown very stale, I haven't even logged in this season. but its objectively not a shit game, the expansion in February looks cool
[2022-12-23 23:14:56] <bhunerbombs> @IPolluxI tencent has nothing to do with overwatch or apex..like...what?
[2022-12-23 23:14:57] <rero1ler> @IPolluxI blizzard has nothing to do with tencent
[2022-12-23 23:15:09] <rero1ler> tencent is Valorant and League
[2022-12-23 23:15:10] <+cl0ud_dealer> Devil's advocate arguments don't work here
[2022-12-23 23:15:15] <myfacewhen1012> I honestly feel that certain timed events are okay, but it can be a difficult balance between granting something to your older players, the ones who had faith in your game early, while also making enough content achievable for newer players
[2022-12-23 23:15:16] <+ocd_game> Overwatch compared to apex, val, siege, and such a hero is just unquestionably more important
[2022-12-23 23:15:21] <pizpeeners> Seagull is so right. The fact that they lock a hero that could potentially affect the meta in a competitive game, under a pay wall, is the dumbest thing ever

[2022-12-23 23:21:10] <fall_senseless> @obamagamingchannel yes it does good sales when yearly dlc drops but if you look at the numbers on steam across the years the game just keeps going to new lows. cross even showed numbers and compared them detailed in one of his videos
[2022-12-23 23:21:14] <gags123> True

[2022-12-23 23:21:23] <thaer_2321> agreed
[2022-12-23 23:21:30] <myfacewhen1012> Honestly the issue is that they prioritize buffs over nerfs in the sense that (League also has this issue as well) they do not have the patience to allow for a sufficient period of time where the playerbase can adjust to knowing how to play with, play as, and play against new heroes without adjusting them asap
[2022-12-23 23:21:32] <+ocd_game> If you are scared of the numbers going down I’m sorry you need to be weeded out

[2022-12-23 23:21:42] <%+The_Great_Rabbi_Balboa> ONLY thing i dont like about OVERWATCH 2 is the RANKING SYSTEM... i like to be able to see my SR
[2022-12-23 23:22:00] <%+The_Great_Rabbi_Balboa> Keep the ranking system jsut like OVERWATCH 1 please
[2022-12-23 23:22:03] <terrytacos> I was playing on my support who is silver 2 and there was a diamond support on the other team. Really don't understand it. I'm plat 2 on dps but that shouldn't matter right?

[2022-12-23 23:22:27] <gags123> Bring back the SR system. 7 wins is just BS for a rank update
[2022-12-23 23:22:30] <+Cescorelli> comp season 2 sucks
[2022-12-23 23:22:34] <+TheDigitalShay> I think having a certain number of games before seeing an update is good, but that number should be 3 whether you win or lose.
[2022-12-23 23:22:40] <+OhFishally> The_Great_Rabbi_Balboa with recent events, have you consider name changing to.. The_Great_Rabbi_BillClinton ?

[2022-12-23 23:22:58] <Zaddy85> bring back the old emblems as well
[2022-12-23 23:22:58] <+Pookiegirl2> I don’t trust Blizzard with managing my SR

[2022-12-23 23:23:14] <+chronovan_> balancing for the lowest skill tier is never a good idea. Ive seen endless games go downhill by catering to the casuals
[2022-12-23 23:23:17] <rero1ler> it's gonna be less and less competitive if that's where the money is because that's at the end all that matters to shareholders.

[2022-12-23 23:25:49] <%sofishdekat> Wokege
[2022-12-23 23:25:54] <ForsakenAgony> Think it's a C+, B-. Probably B-5v5 better, overall game is better gameplay wise.. Halloween PvE was short but looked promising for the future. Some patches took too long to fix but overall it was fine?.. But, how the comp started was bad and balancing of the teams is not really great at all.. Skins are too expensive but almost understandable why they're that expensive because it's one of the only ways they're making money. Skins take WAAYYYYYYY too long as a new F2P player.
[2022-12-23 23:25:55] <%+The_Great_Rabbi_Balboa> Bring BACK tank Duo's..  PLEASE

[2022-12-23 23:38:22] <+Pookiegirl2> It’s unfortunate when these high profile streamers are “in bed” with Blizzard bc then when asked on streams like that they are turn between actually given their real opinion of the game and their loyalty to Blizzard. A streamer who was 2 weeks ago crying ab how they weren’t sure if they could continue to make a living with ow2 bc of how bad it was just gave it an overall rank of B.

[2022-12-23 23:53:20] <%wasabiroot> definitely,  games feel more deathmatchy and players allergic to point cap
[2022-12-23 23:53:22] <+raider4life111> It feels as if there is no progression  and nothing to actually work towards in the game

[2022-12-23 23:53:28] <terrytacos> Does anyone know if theres a limit to the rank difference between two players until they can't be paired with each other? I think for queuing together its 2 full ranks, but I almost feel like since the matchmaking changes I've seen bigger rank differences like a silver and diamond player in the same game
