If they accept, both participants say !roll to roll a number. The higher roll wins, and the lower roll gets a time out. Ties are a reroll.

[2022-12-28 13:40:14] <+JamoYZFR1> @stanni it's barely different. As a usec, the second you attack a rogue or aggro them, they became identical. Also, rogues remember that for a couple raids or something so next to no difference

[2022-12-28 13:41:00] <+JamoYZFR1> @stanni it doesnt even change the routes you can take. You can still run straight at the plant from the bridge on the right side by using the car to block the right gunners vision, and kill the left gunner from there
[2022-12-28 13:41:01] <SamSonYourStepChad> LUL ok

[2022-12-28 14:58:57] <%Koritska> Rogues not aggroing usec on sight is intentional and not a bug, right?

[2022-12-28 14:59:01] <%+A1thur_> Hey, axel. Does Usec actually have more of a benefit than a bear? I Kind of want to pick Bear because of the clothes but Usec seem to just have it better.

[2022-12-28 14:59:54] <+JamoYZFR1> @A1thur_ just pick bear. Usec barely has any advantage at all, and if youre half decent, you can completely negate the "advantage"

[2022-12-28 15:00:21] <+JamoYZFR1> @A1thur_ the second a USEC aggros or attacks a rogue, they become identical to a bear. You can even use the same routes to farm WTP as a bear
[2022-12-28 15:00:38] <FangRatnik> do u know at what time  they started installation
[2022-12-28 15:00:39] <%squidyp0> @A1thur_ if you dont care about lighthouse there are tasks each faction gets that is to kill the other. Most consider those easier for bear bc most ppl pick usec
[2022-12-28 15:00:40] <+longschlongdamage> which bear has no breathing?

[2022-12-28 18:47:26] <@%^Nightbot> @Gorusgaming  Chatters can fight to time each other out for 10 minutes. To start a fight, redeem the 3333 channel point option and @ your opponent. If they accept, both participants say !roll to roll a number. The higher roll wins, and the lower roll gets a time out. Ties are a reroll.

[2022-12-28 22:17:50] <paibro1> i think binaural enables Oculus audio and that's the thing bugged
[2022-12-28 22:18:00] <%ActivateZeroG> @yungraviti I keep refreshing it and eventually it comes up
[2022-12-28 22:18:04] <gangstergrandma1> ok thanks yeah the new audio is pretty shit

[2022-12-28 23:50:24] <smileyboy420> does it make any difference now if you have bineral audio on or off
[2022-12-28 23:50:29] <+ez_mystix_yt> @Axel_tv is endurance also not leveling up for you?
[2022-12-28 23:50:31] <0PYR3X> Devs said to use it tho

[2022-12-28 23:51:20] <kinderys96> does it have hard  impact on performance?
[2022-12-28 23:51:35] <TheBigBeastGD> does anyone have big performance issues after the wipe i have like 40 fps on customs and woods makes the game literally unplayible when i shoot fps drop even more
[2022-12-28 23:51:37] <%+iBIHzz> @Axel_tv have u find locked doors when u did offline raids?
[2022-12-28 23:51:52] <+ez_mystix_yt> is your endurance leveling up?
[2022-12-28 23:51:53] <kinderys96> game looks much better with it in buildings etc.
