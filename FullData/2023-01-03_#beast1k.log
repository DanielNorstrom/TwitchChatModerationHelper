[2023-01-03 17:42:28] <%sunnywyy> ResidentSleeper i got it
[2023-01-03 17:42:35] <%sunnywyy> so safe zone stuff
[2023-01-03 17:42:59] <%sunnywyy> issue is that safe zone contents make around 4 times less than lethal contents
[2023-01-03 17:43:02] VIEWERS: 3¬†720
[2023-01-03 17:43:09] <%sunnywyy> unless u are doing transports
[2023-01-03 17:43:12] <+IndieNer> I would just find the content you think is fun then do it and you will make silver
[2023-01-03 17:43:16] <Lucifer127127> basically dont wanna risk silver without having safe income
[2023-01-03 17:43:26] <Damage13> this aint the game then
[2023-01-03 17:43:31] <Damage13> risk it for the biscuit
[2023-01-03 17:44:00] <%sunnywyy> but safe zone gathering requires longest time to progress to get to high specs hence gathering speed, while u get started right away in cds
[2023-01-03 17:44:05] <+IndieNer> And not fun
[2023-01-03 17:44:10] <%JonDogWoof> gotta risk it for the biscuit. i'm so stealing that

[2023-01-03 17:45:44] <+IndieNer> One of the first things I did when I started this game was loaded up everything I own to and moved cities and got ganked on the way.
[2023-01-03 17:45:50] <+IndieNer> Quit the game for a while after that
[2023-01-03 17:45:54] <Lucifer127127> i will most likely do the risky content once i can actually do pvp, but have to get to that point
[2023-01-03 17:45:54] <%sunnywyy> you can make around like 750k per hour at highest specs gathering t3-4-5 resources
[2023-01-03 17:46:19] <+IndieNer> Go do some hunter CDs
[2023-01-03 17:47:03] <Lucifer127127> would it make sense to do gathering and once i got bored of that after ~4 hours do some CD's?
