[2022-12-22 11:19:04] <%+AWaltzingDingo> Thing is, people are comfortable chatting with streamers on Twitch. Facebook - you need to make a fake additional profile to be "Safe" if you want to chat in Facebook Gaming.
[2022-12-22 11:19:13] <raVAGedsins> NODDERS
[2022-12-22 11:19:15] <+Slain0r> just block the ads on twitch
[2022-12-22 11:19:20] <%+AWaltzingDingo> Nobody wants their IRL name blasted out publicly to RP Andies on Facebook.
[2022-12-22 11:19:33] <simarse> yeah true
[2022-12-22 11:19:35] <%Prollos> ads are high in december, come january there will be a drought like on youtube, businesses have marketing budgets to throw at places for holidays etc NODDERS
[2022-12-22 11:19:37] <@%nmussa> Seems like they're slowing down on the aquisitions now anyway
[2022-12-22 11:19:40] <AimlessArt> But on facebook you HAVE to stream RP for a certain hour per week/month etc. Don't think you'd like that.
[2022-12-22 11:19:49] <AimlessArt> part fo the contract
[2022-12-22 11:20:28] <%Riceling> youd need a schedule PepeLaugh
[2022-12-22 11:20:54] VIEWERS: 832
[2022-12-22 11:20:55] <+Perfectsplit> it's still a pittance compared to the ad revenue split that some people used to get.
[2022-12-22 11:20:57] <%Propforward> should pay in timtams
[2022-12-22 11:21:00] <%aiiiR_> Some of my streamers was getting mad money then their latest adcentive was DOGWATER KEKVV
[2022-12-22 11:21:02] <%+AWaltzingDingo> Also if you don't want ads on Twitch, get Turbo! LONG TERM, it can actually give more support to streamers than a tier 1 sub every here and there.
[2022-12-22 11:21:06] <KirkHasselen> super bowl and holiday season.. ad sessions :)
[2022-12-22 11:21:14] <%Isabellaaaa> wow
[2022-12-22 11:21:20] <simarse> yeah
[2022-12-22 11:21:26] <%Isabellaaaa> so its for sure worth it

[2022-12-22 11:21:36] <@%nmussa> No more ads for Twitch Prime was already a tragedy
[2022-12-22 11:21:40] <0nceuponadim3> i dont mind watching ads, just that they are insufferably loud
[2022-12-22 11:21:43] <%DumboTheWise> I am glad I have turbo for those places I dont visit as much as here which gets my sub NODDERS
[2022-12-22 11:21:46] <@%nmussa> I mean the removal of the no ads
[2022-12-22 11:21:50] <%+AWaltzingDingo> Your view of an advert NOT MUTED, video rendering, is worth more than four months of gifted subs out of a year.
[2022-12-22 11:21:51] <%Prollos> ads also keep the platform alive, just look at how much companies pay to have their product on the superbowl, the money is there and im all for the streamer to get the bag NODDERS
[2022-12-22 11:21:56] <SwerbianTV> general push + holiday season, it all makes sense from a business POV
[2022-12-22 11:21:57] <fah__king> and in turn the subs to go up to avoid the ads, it's smart on their part
[2022-12-22 11:22:06] <%aiiiR_> @nmussa moon2BRAIN cancelling twitch prime for turbo
[2022-12-22 11:22:22] <+skuffed39> 40k for some 1k streamers is a blessing imo

[2022-12-22 11:22:29] <%themoonandmore> Turbo users count as an ad view from what ive read
[2022-12-22 11:22:30] <%itsmemusicforcars> turbo is so worth it

[2022-12-22 11:22:36] <+Muddr> I've had turbo since it was announced and will never get rid of it
[2022-12-22 11:22:38] <%aiiiR_> @nmussa das wat subs is fo
[2022-12-22 11:22:39] <%GIaci> Turbo is the best investment in this site, sadly it means I wont sub to people outside prime really
[2022-12-22 11:22:40] <+asthenos1> Turbo is a must have for RP viewers

[2022-12-22 11:23:01] <+RomanNumera> I absolutely have turbo but still sub to the 3 streamers I watch the most.
[2022-12-22 11:23:02] <simarse> honestly id buy turbo if id have the money. for me i prefer prerolls xD
[2022-12-22 11:23:04] [Notification] TheFrankuccino subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months!
[2022-12-22 11:23:04] <+Perfectsplit> continuously updating chrome extensions to avoid them is tedious, too. turbo is certainly a value proposition worth considering

[2022-12-22 11:23:17] <%Prollos> @nmussa with turbo the streamer still gets ad revenue from you even tho you dont see the add, little known fact NODDERS
[2022-12-22 11:23:18] <%dreageman> The advertisements actually kill twitch and it seems unwatchable + the reoccurrence of ads is super annoying
[2022-12-22 11:23:21] <%LoumasHere> the new ads, which pop under your stream and make the stream slightly smaller so it has space, I hate them with burning passion
[2022-12-22 11:23:24] <%ULTIMVTUM> Turbo is great for watching RP streams, esp when jumping for multiple POVs, etc
[2022-12-22 11:23:27] <@%nmussa> @Prollos Yeah that's why I said 99%
[2022-12-22 11:23:29] <+UtahOutLawww> Turbo
[2022-12-22 11:23:34] <SwerbianTV> I think youre on to something with the like 5min or 10min ad free

[2022-12-22 11:23:43] <SwerbianTV> yes they mute the stream
[2022-12-22 11:23:44] <%+GrandadM> nope
[2022-12-22 11:23:44] <%itsmemusicforcars> turbo feels essential as an rp viewer
[2022-12-22 11:23:44] <@%nmussa> @Prollos Even if you get served with a thousand ads each month, it won't cover the cost of Turbo
[2022-12-22 11:23:45] <%+AWaltzingDingo> It's when you get hit with the occasional 90 seconds worth of ads, where you cannot wait till the end of the ads and hit "Clip" to catch up on what you missed.
[2022-12-22 11:23:54] <+Icalldibs> Banner ads dont mute for me
[2022-12-22 11:23:56] <%LoumasHere> they are like YouTube ads on tour oc, just a small white window under the video

[2022-12-22 11:24:23] <fah__king> is it your choice when the ads run?

[2022-12-22 11:24:50] <%dreageman> Is turbo an annual fee?
[2022-12-22 11:24:57] VIEWERS: 873
[2022-12-22 11:25:00] <%+AWaltzingDingo> STREAM shrinks to top right, and advert takes the full screen.

[2022-12-22 11:25:01] <%Prollos> make the ad interactive in the chat so they have stats to send back to advertisers (similar to the skip function on youtube LUL )
[2022-12-22 11:25:19] <@%nmussa> Yeah I could take over the ad running but with RP

[2022-12-22 11:25:40] <%+AWaltzingDingo> @dreageman Monthly. If you sub to two people with a tier 1, that's already a Turbo sub.
[2022-12-22 11:25:40] <+bananagabz> that's why i pay for nitro
[2022-12-22 11:25:41] <%aiiiR_> give me a "dont show me this type of ad again" And i might watch them.

[2022-12-22 11:27:15] <@%nmussa> I think it predates Twitch Prime
[2022-12-22 11:27:18] <icantremember9> it almost seems like there is twitch staff playing adds at an asshole time LUL

[2022-12-22 11:29:02] <%+AWaltzingDingo> The most TRIGGERING THING EVER re:adverts for me was when it was close to Election Time here in Australia, and I got one of those horrible donkey political party adverts. LUL
[2022-12-22 11:29:04] <%Riceling> 1 of 2 10/15 seconds
[2022-12-22 11:29:06] <0nceuponadim3> first one could be 15 seconds and 3 more 30 second ones
[2022-12-22 11:29:07] <@%nmussa> If you know how long it takes, you can just walk away and come back
[2022-12-22 11:29:12] <@%nmussa> If you don't know, you just sit there
[2022-12-22 11:29:16] <SwerbianTV> The difference in Markets makes sense and is a thing, I get way less ads in Serbia when visiting family then up here in Sweden where I live

[2022-12-22 11:29:32] <fah__king> since we are being transparent, do  streamers get incentives from viewers with adblock?
[2022-12-22 11:29:39] <%dreageman> Whats the turbo app?

[2022-12-22 11:29:56] <%dreageman> Thanks.
[2022-12-22 11:29:59] <AimlessArt> With how twitch is rolling more fix to mess up with the adblock, I'd assume so
[2022-12-22 11:30:06] <%+AWaltzingDingo> @fah__king Many Adblockers don't work with Twitch, but the ones that do work and block adverts - they are not counted for ad views.
[2022-12-22 11:30:07] <%Prollos> its like youtube premium NODDERS
[2022-12-22 11:30:11] <%kattjie> I tend to get the same ad everytime, I think because of my country curvyeLUL I will also mostly get ads during holidays or certain events

[2022-12-22 11:37:18] <%LoumasHere> that's a fair view, but often times asking for a sub is just a reminder to people that they are able to do it, for example PewDiePie once talked about his start as a YouTuber and said one single biggest thing that helped him get subscribers was reminding them at the end of the video, that's why people do it
[2022-12-22 11:37:46] <fah__king> so when stream say ''thanks for the 27 months'' thats a resub right, i get confused

[2022-12-22 11:41:28] <@%nmussa> @Benuker Pretty sure it's the buyer price that matters
[2022-12-22 11:41:37] <%+GrandadM> @aiiiR_ the National Minimum Wage in the UK for someone over 25 is lke £8 / 9 something like that
[2022-12-22 11:41:38] <%+dreageman> Whats crazy is i didnt know about twitch turbo until now
[2022-12-22 11:41:43] <%+AWaltzingDingo> Yuuuup, Australian sub prices are high.

[2022-12-22 11:41:53] <%mittensduck73> dumbo aus and nz have the same t1 sub prices
[2022-12-22 11:42:02] <+jacky_horse> I had to downside my subs because it was more expensive in Canada then originally the USA
[2022-12-22 11:42:07] <%Tirias> They really don't push Turbo
[2022-12-22 11:42:08] <fah__king> i'm in Australia, a sub is $8, $7.99 to be exact
[2022-12-22 11:42:10] <%DumboTheWise> Yes but currency conversion makes nz cheaper mittensduck73 ;)
[2022-12-22 11:42:17] <AimlessArt> There is no regional pricing for Turbo LUL
[2022-12-22 11:42:19] <%mittensduck73> oh yeah
[2022-12-22 11:42:20] <%+dreageman> I mean im saving big money cancelling subs for the streamer to gain more money
[2022-12-22 11:42:23] <akshay2653> @Benuker let's test that gift me a sub
[2022-12-22 11:42:24] <%BeeBuzz88> I do turbo and sub to streamers so I can watch people I don’t sub to without damn ads lol

[2022-12-22 11:42:56] <%+AWaltzingDingo> Indeed. And then your view still counts for advert metrics.
[2022-12-22 11:43:00] <akshay2653> there is no turbo in india

[2022-12-22 11:43:21] <simarse> god damn
[2022-12-22 11:43:24] <%Riceling> rp is cringe DansGame
[2022-12-22 11:43:27] <%DumboTheWise> I think turbo is roughly 14 for me a month
[2022-12-22 11:43:28] <@%nmussa> And Pokimane NODDERS
[2022-12-22 11:43:31] <%+dreageman> 21 x $2.50 right? Versus $8?
[2022-12-22 11:43:33] <%+AWaltzingDingo> And if you want to take it ANOTHER step further, what you can do is download OperaGX and you can mute TABS, not the stream, and that will also count for an adview even though you're muting the stream tab.
[2022-12-22 11:43:37] <AimlessArt> pokiW check
[2022-12-22 11:43:39] <+lewh> Also if you have turbo it still counts as if you watched the adds so youre still supporting the creater
[2022-12-22 11:43:46] <%Riceling> pokiW
[2022-12-22 11:43:49] <%mittensduck73> i do ad blocker cause i only want to sub to you and i rarely watch twitch that isnt you do no point in me having turbo

[2022-12-22 11:43:56] <@%nmussa> That's shit KEKW
[2022-12-22 11:43:56] <%ULTIMVTUM> yup
[2022-12-22 11:43:58] <%BeeBuzz88> I sub 15 people, I watch 4 consistently lol. But I still want to support those other people I may watch now and then. I sometimes also forget I have subbed to people lol
[2022-12-22 11:44:00] <%aiiiR_> @GrandadM HOLY SHIT what is happening in the UK monkaChrist
[2022-12-22 11:44:10] <@%nmussa> $9/m for a few ad runs is terrible
[2022-12-22 11:44:12] <%LoumasHere> subbing to other streamers is kind of courtesy, lot of the do the same for you, so it cancels itself out
[2022-12-22 11:44:16] <+lena165> turbo is op and i like it
[2022-12-22 11:44:16] <%aiiiR_> thats 15aud per hour moon2PAIN
[2022-12-22 11:44:19] <%+SGarr17> Twitch isn't getting more money out of me until they start supporting their creators better
[2022-12-22 11:44:22] <%+Jrd_> and with turbo you get custom name color
[2022-12-22 11:44:28] <+lewh> That was my concern was if I get turbo i wouldn't be support the streamer outside of the +1 viewer
[2022-12-22 11:44:29] <%Tirias> The first month I got Turbo it didn't auto renew and spammed me with so many ads when it ran out
[2022-12-22 11:44:32] <@%nmussa> It's cents
[2022-12-22 11:44:36] <@%nmussa> Max
[2022-12-22 11:44:43] <%+dreageman> I’ll be real here @curvyelephant i feel like $8 is a steal versus having multiple $5 subs. Its a money gainer for me, not saying i couldnt afford it anyway
[2022-12-22 11:44:53] <%DumboTheWise> As someone who did it for a little with a small audience.... It is a terribly small amount
[2022-12-22 11:44:58] <%aiiiR_> Sometimes it feels like it KEKW
[2022-12-22 11:45:03] VIEWERS: 925
[2022-12-22 11:45:05] <simarse> 1 cents per 5 ads?
[2022-12-22 11:45:06] <AimlessArt> I think subs is better if you want to support specific streamer
[2022-12-22 11:45:15] <%mittensduck73> wait it $0.09 for few ads??
[2022-12-22 11:45:19] <derpdankstrom> speaking of ads
[2022-12-22 11:45:22] <%+Perfectsplit> @curvyelephant were you ever part of the ad revenue split trial program? Cuz uhhhh, the money was insaaaaane.
[2022-12-22 11:46:10] <%duffrose1980> Is there an algorithm for being gifted a sub? I get gifted very often, to the same streamers as well.
[2022-12-22 11:46:10] <%+dreageman> Yeah true but some emotes are wicked and i may consider resubbing to certain channels..
[2022-12-22 11:46:11] <%ULTIMVTUM> NODDERS

[2022-12-22 11:46:42] <%mittensduck73> you can change it to make you not get gifted unless you are following
[2022-12-22 11:46:44] <%Tirias> I notice if I gift subs to say this channel - I'll get that many gifts subs in the next couple of days from other channels

Because the more you believe you are that person the stronger you will be at selling that character's personality in RP senarios

[2022-12-22 15:05:33] <@%^StreamElements> I'm currently playing on a whitelisted GTA V RP server called NoPixel using the FiveM client ( https://fivem.net ). If you're interested in joining, visit https://nopixel.net to apply. To answer a few questions, you do NOT need to be a streamer to play on NoPixel. You will very likely have to wait a fair amount of time to receive a response to your application given the recent influx of people interested in playing.

[2022-12-22 15:28:03] <TyDye99> @0Reed Unsure, but if you are looking to build a new PC, look for the Ryzen 5800X3D. Does really well in GTA

[2022-12-22 15:28:41] <Samasulee> I've heard to stay away from Arc for now
[2022-12-22 15:28:47] <+Techniker32> @tydye99 No, rather wait for the new Ryzen Lineups, with 3D Cache. Might be way better

[2022-12-22 15:29:22] <TyDye99> @Techniker32 True @0Reed there may be new CPUs releasing soonish
[2022-12-22 15:29:28] <!0Reed> ooo
[2022-12-22 15:29:44] <TyDye99> @Samasulee Intel Arc are GPUs (graphics cards) not CPUs
[2022-12-22 15:29:46] <+Techniker32> Should be Q1 2023
[2022-12-22 15:29:58] <!0Reed> thats good cause i want to pick up  one of the new AMD gpu's and do an AMD build
[2022-12-22 15:30:10] <!0Reed> so ill get one of the new CPU's too

[2022-12-22 15:30:18] <+Techniker32> @0reed Depends. Are u playing newer or older games?
[2022-12-22 15:30:20] <Samasulee> @tydye99 I know
[2022-12-22 15:30:25] <TyDye99> That will be sick. All AMD will be awesome
[2022-12-22 15:30:27] <!0Reed> both
[2022-12-22 15:31:01] <Samasulee> it's just that if someone is planning of building they kinda need a gpu
[2022-12-22 15:31:14] <+Techniker32> If it's in your budget, the 4090 might really future proof you for GOOD. In combination with the new Ryzens, would be the perfect match
[2022-12-22 15:31:26] <Samasulee> unless they get an integrated
[2022-12-22 15:31:34] <+Techniker32> But rather look at the upcoming reviews. Those help massively
