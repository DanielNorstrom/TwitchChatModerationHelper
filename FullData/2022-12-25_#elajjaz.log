[2022-12-25 01:14:06] <%AkirameMiko> boomer club = Deadge
[2022-12-25 01:14:27] <%Pandushe> its just back pain miko Madge
[2022-12-25 01:15:01] <%AkirameMiko> i was struggling with random back pains since i was in school
[2022-12-25 01:15:04] <%Orphir94> I shall make the most of my youth whilst it lasts BBoomer
[2022-12-25 01:15:10] <%AkirameMiko> and then one day i decided to check what that really was
[2022-12-25 01:15:14] <%AkirameMiko> and it was stomach pain all along
[2022-12-25 01:15:56] <%Pandushe> eh
[2022-12-25 01:16:02] <%Pandushe> my back was borked in the army
[2022-12-25 01:16:18] <%AkirameMiko> i'm just elaShrimp
[2022-12-25 01:16:43] <%AkirameMiko> i just thought it was back pain cause my whole chest was hurting from front to back
[2022-12-25 01:17:05] <%AkirameMiko> and it was that kinda numb pain
[2022-12-25 01:18:04] <@%^StreamElements> Twotter: twitter.com/elajjaz
[2022-12-25 01:18:11] <%Pandushe> but then you got checked out and it was nothing Clueless
[2022-12-25 01:19:04] <%AkirameMiko> must've been the wind BowTime akiramClueless
[2022-12-25 01:19:25] <%AkirameMiko> it was my stomack hurting apparently
[2022-12-25 01:19:41] <%AkirameMiko> i started taking medicine for it whenever it happens, and it worked like a charm
[2022-12-25 01:20:26] <%Pandushe> i had lots of back pain and everytime i went to the doctor
[2022-12-25 01:20:30] <%Pandushe> he was like
[2022-12-25 01:20:47] <%Pandushe> "eh this happens all the time, by the time we do xrays and stuff you'll be fine again and we wasted time for nothing"
[2022-12-25 01:21:32] <%Pandushe> i was like sure fine whatever
[2022-12-25 01:21:36] <%Pandushe> but it kept happening
[2022-12-25 01:21:53] <%Pandushe> so i insisted on getting checked more thoroughly
[2022-12-25 01:22:13] <%Pandushe> it was nothing just me overworking or w/e
[2022-12-25 01:22:42] <%AkirameMiko> 4Shrug better safe than sorry
[2022-12-25 01:23:39] <%Pandushe> only thing we found it is that my left leg is a bit taller than right leg, could be a contributing factor but the height difference is miniscule
[2022-12-25 01:24:36] <%AkirameMiko> you're literally forsenE irl FeelsStrongMan
[2022-12-25 01:24:47] <%Pandushe> Madge no
[2022-12-25 01:26:50] <%AkirameMiko> i pinched the nerves on my face once somehow, and couldn't move the right side of it almost at all
[2022-12-25 01:26:57] <%AkirameMiko> was probably looking like forsenE whenever i tried to smile PepeLaugg
[2022-12-25 01:27:16] <%Pandushe> wut moment

[2022-12-25 21:08:42] <zoibergOne> the same thing happened to be before, in boshy
[2022-12-25 21:09:01] <zoibergOne> boshy also kills your save file if you bluescreen or electricity shuts off

[2022-12-25 21:19:15] <%Quifenadine> thats ingame checkpoint saves
[2022-12-25 21:19:20] <%Quifenadine> not steam cloud save issues
[2022-12-25 21:19:38] <%Pandushe> Nerdge
[2022-12-25 21:19:38] <zoibergOne> i get it
[2022-12-25 21:19:39] <%Quifenadine> all steam cloud saves do is put your game savefile on the cloud
[2022-12-25 21:19:46] <%Quifenadine> ‚òÅ
[2022-12-25 21:19:47] <zoibergOne> yes, i get it
[2022-12-25 21:20:11] <zoibergOne> but, lets imagine, power died, why wont it just load the stuff it loaded last time?
[2022-12-25 21:20:16] <%Quifenadine> issue? Tomfoolery
[2022-12-25 21:20:22] <zoibergOne> skill issues
[2022-12-25 21:20:26] <%Quifenadine> it should do that
[2022-12-25 21:20:28] <%Quifenadine> does it not do that?
[2022-12-25 21:20:31] <zoibergOne> it didnt
[2022-12-25 21:20:40] <zoibergOne> my 18 hours save died
[2022-12-25 21:20:41] <%Quifenadine> if it doesnt do that then the game made it overwrite the cloud save
[2022-12-25 21:20:58] <%Quifenadine> afaik its just one save in the cloud, and its the most recent one

[2022-12-25 22:23:39] <%iSilent_> never heard of it DankNoted
[2022-12-25 22:24:19] <%$HappiSmyle> It is 10 year old or so. Just re-watching some things out of nostalgia.
[2022-12-25 22:25:09] <%$HappiSmyle> If you have some comedy stuff, I would gladly write it down elaSmile

[2022-12-25 22:30:19] <%$HappiSmyle> Slice of life monkaS
[2022-12-25 22:30:29] <%$HappiSmyle> gotta be dank elaKek
[2022-12-25 22:30:32] <%Pandushe> its way more comedy
[2022-12-25 22:30:44] <%Pandushe> its absolutely ridiculous
[2022-12-25 22:31:24] <%Pandushe> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7Et0a8fnuw
[2022-12-25 22:31:26] <%Pandushe> for example
[2022-12-25 22:31:30] <%$HappiSmyle> I think I tried to watch first episode years ago. didn't they discussed Croissants whole episode? elaKek
[2022-12-25 22:31:52] <%Pandushe> no that was lucky star
[2022-12-25 22:32:21] <%$HappiSmyle> Oh.. gotta write it down also. It was too dank on the time I tried to watch then
[2022-12-25 22:32:28] <%$HappiSmyle> I am stronger now GIGACHAD
[2022-12-25 22:32:34] <%Pandushe> lucky star is a bit tougher to watch
[2022-12-25 22:33:04] <%Pandushe> but that corissant thing is only on the first episode
[2022-12-25 22:33:08] <%Pandushe> rest of them are fine
[2022-12-25 22:33:24] <%Pandushe> but its also alot of references and some japanese culture
[2022-12-25 22:33:34] <%Pandushe> so its a bit tough to enjoy it fully without knowledge
[2022-12-25 22:34:14] <%$HappiSmyle> My perspective of Japanese culture is completely perverted and ruined because it all perspective comes from anime elaKek
[2022-12-25 22:34:48] <%Pandushe> i wouldnt recommend lucky star then
[2022-12-25 22:35:01] <%Pandushe> specially since the references and jokes are past their time
[2022-12-25 22:35:04] <%AkirameMiko> i remember watching nichijou like 10 years ago
[2022-12-25 22:35:11] <%AkirameMiko> it was good PepeLaugg
[2022-12-25 22:35:14] <%Pandushe> its just so crazy
[2022-12-25 22:35:29] <%AkirameMiko> there was that one manga about a ex-yakuza househusband
[2022-12-25 22:35:32] <%Pandushe> literally have no idea whats coming
[2022-12-25 22:35:39] <%AkirameMiko> that shit was actually absolutely hilarous
[2022-12-25 22:35:58] <%Pandushe> are you talking about way of the house husband?
[2022-12-25 22:36:32] <%AkirameMiko> https://chapmanganato.com/manga-be978739
[2022-12-25 22:36:33] <zoibergOne> homosexuality?
[2022-12-25 22:36:34] <%AkirameMiko> yeah
[2022-12-25 22:36:40] <zoibergOne> hehehe
[2022-12-25 22:36:41] <%Pandushe> yea man
[2022-12-25 22:36:42] <%AkirameMiko> i think it got an anime too not too long ago
[2022-12-25 22:36:47] <%Pandushe> the anime did not do it justice
[2022-12-25 22:36:50] <%Pandushe> 2 seasons
[2022-12-25 22:36:59] <%Pandushe> it was like power point presentations
[2022-12-25 22:36:59] <zoibergOne> anime is a broad word for that thing
[2022-12-25 22:37:12] <%AkirameMiko> just read it then ElaOkey
[2022-12-25 22:37:26] <%Pandushe> watching it was pretty much the same as reading it Aware
[2022-12-25 22:37:40] <%AkirameMiko> i think the funniest thing i've ever read was gintama actually
[2022-12-25 22:37:48] <%AkirameMiko> i was reading a chapter at work and actually couldn't hold myself back from laughing
[2022-12-25 22:37:50] <%Pandushe> gintama is even better in anime form bro
[2022-12-25 22:37:54] <%AkirameMiko> even though i really tried PepeLaugg
[2022-12-25 22:37:56] <%Pandushe> like 100% better

[2022-12-25 22:38:33] <%Pandushe> Gin's VA is forever ingrained in my mind as Gin
[2022-12-25 22:38:38] <%AkirameMiko> i watched it earlier so i can read manga and supplement the voice acting and sountrack with my imagination
[2022-12-25 22:38:59] <%Pandushe> like every time i hear him in any other show i juust instantly think its Gin doing a bit LULW
[2022-12-25 22:39:22] <%AkirameMiko> i don't watch anything, so not a problem for me 4Shrug
[2022-12-25 22:39:34] <%Pandushe> Nerdge i only enjoy manga
[2022-12-25 22:39:53] <%AkirameMiko> ain't nobody got time to spend 20 minutes on one episode
