[2022-12-24 18:53:24] <+ChefHall> @catloafjr not if 40000 people are playing and id assume more upon release
[2022-12-24 18:53:32] <smooshpig> if your dying to spiders im sry but you def need to get gud. just break there spawn lmao
[2022-12-24 18:53:44] <+Hurpud> u cant outrun range
[2022-12-24 18:53:51] <Graveexode> all that gold lol
[2022-12-24 18:53:52] <+Hurpud> if u get hit by an axe or arrow u slow down
[2022-12-24 18:54:01] <+BearlyAlivee> imagine the ratting in solo queue
[2022-12-24 18:54:07] <%1zewski> @Legendary_Wish not these god bows, the long bow dmg got reduced and they are over damage for the bow, they stopped them from trading
[2022-12-24 18:54:12] <+Legendary_Wish> Only LUL
[2022-12-24 18:54:25] <%catloafjr> @catloafjr it may stay that many players for release, but then how long after? Once it starts to drop, the game only dies faster
[2022-12-24 18:54:58] <+Hurpud> no point in solo queue, just be better than average and u can take out 3 mans
[2022-12-24 18:54:59] <+ChefHall> @catloafjr depends on if they keep it fresh w updates and patches etc
[2022-12-24 18:55:06] <+Hurpud> but it takes a little more effort

[2022-12-24 18:55:07] <1crazyblackbeard> its not that ur losing any gold, its that it's taking up unnecessary inventory space u can be using for loot

[2022-12-24 18:56:21] <+EskimoOMNI> does shots know that healing spells regen at campfires?

[2022-12-24 18:56:31] <%d3ltaf0x> did he forgot the gold?
[2022-12-24 18:56:32] <%JDmaelstrom> @Hurpud dont disagree with you but most players aren't going to be better than average. So Id almost say having an easier solo queue raid with lesser loot tables may be a better  long term solution.
[2022-12-24 18:56:38] <%Rogue__Kill> All they would have to do is create single player v. single for online and a Multi player mode for online that anyone can join
[2022-12-24 18:56:58] <%JDmaelstrom> how many players will quit on the first day after being shit on by 3 mans .... probably say there will be a fair amount
[2022-12-24 18:57:03] <+Hurpud> @JDmaelstrom if u grind solo enough u automatically become better than the average player

[2022-12-24 18:57:37] <%$SlimRelik> i remember a few wipes ago in tarkov i bought a wallet hutch put up on first day of wipe and i named it hutchs nipple pouch
[2022-12-24 18:57:52] <smooshpig> solo players gonna cry about the mobs and how they dont have heals etc. this game works better with a team. with that said if your solo avoid a bunch and be a rat. how you gonna go to hell and complete it solo??? lmao theres roles for a reason
[2022-12-24 18:57:59] <%JDmaelstrom> im not speaking for me personally but there are a lot of people who won't suffer through the grind if its 3v1s.
[2022-12-24 18:58:10] <%CruddieX> xd
[2022-12-24 18:58:15] <minirine_> merry christmas everyone
[2022-12-24 18:58:20] <awol_lsd> @Rogue__Kill eh really all they would have to do is make a solo matching priority. so all same queue but solo try to match with other solo's first. then even if player count dwindles it wouldn't split the players making queue times longer.
[2022-12-24 18:58:21] <%catloafjr> door opens to where you are going
[2022-12-24 18:58:23] <minirine_> love all of you
[2022-12-24 18:58:27] <minirine_> proud of all of you
[2022-12-24 18:58:27] <%heartgold22> For those wanting solo q, you have to understand the math of Qs and q time. Splitting it like that would hurt all q times and might make solo q die
[2022-12-24 18:58:31] <+Hurpud> @JDmaelstrom i think solo queues and stuff to cater to solos will potentially get more players and be more accessible but it kinda feels like asking for an easy mode in fromsoft games
[2022-12-24 18:58:33] <%Rogue__Kill> 2v1 would help the disparity...
[2022-12-24 18:59:02] <%heartgold22> A slight agility bonus for the first X games in solo might be a good alternative

[2022-12-24 18:59:23] <%JDmaelstrom> @Hurpud oh 100% would be easy mode or at least easier that is why loot tables would have to be not nearly as good as regular queue
[2022-12-24 18:59:36] <minirine_> dont mages cast really quick and just deal solid damage
[2022-12-24 18:59:38] <+shadyderperlol> try cleric

[2022-12-24 19:00:57] <%Rogue__Kill> @Rogue__Kill true, the only breakdown is if you have low player numbers....then they'll be forced more often.  I think that is an incremental step though....crazy they haven't done that..
[2022-12-24 19:01:03] <+Hurpud> @JDmaelstrom maybe a tutorial/introduction queue that goes away at lvl 5

[2022-12-24 19:02:50] <%heartgold22> @smooshpig To an extent true for many, it needs to be viewed as a primarily team game with solo optional
[2022-12-24 19:03:02] <smooshpig> @Hurpud then why do we need a solo queue if your already doing fine solo?

[2022-12-24 19:05:07] <smooshpig> @smooshpig your not complainng tho. the other ppl who alreadfy think its hard solo vs 3 mans which i wouldnt fight anyways are still potentioally gonna hev 3 solos final circle lol its like tarkov your not meant to win every raid
[2022-12-24 19:05:08] <+Hurpud> @smooshpig i used to think soloing was bs and 3 mans were always too strong but then i no lifed the game and roll through everyone
