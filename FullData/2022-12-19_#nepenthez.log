[2022-12-19 00:34:03] <@%Witchwalker70> Yes good thanks, so close today for you. A roller coaster! @ItsTr3ple

[2022-12-19 00:34:44] <%+stackmillz> shout out to every karen in the world
[2022-12-19 00:34:45] <+theinactivestreamer> You think they going to change flashback Ronaldo link in the future because of how hard it is to get him at 3 chemistry without World Cup players
[2022-12-19 00:35:04] <cormac_dowd> !record
[2022-12-19 00:35:06] <%+pierce_23> @theinactivestreamer nah
[2022-12-19 00:35:07] <@%Witchwalker70> It was a great game, just glad I didn't have a vested interest otherwise I would have been on the vodka big time LUL @ItsTr3ple

[2022-12-19 00:35:27] <%SaneCaeser> 91 Harry Kane is a beast despite it being his flash back from a few year's ago.
[2022-12-19 00:35:36] <+352dikyzarc> is the 88+ mid or WC icon worth doing??
[2022-12-19 00:35:37] <jameshughes98978> Evening neppo, did you do the icon pack?
[2022-12-19 00:35:53] <%$ItsTr3ple> Big Man JB
[2022-12-19 00:35:57] <%$J1___> i cant get on with Big D man
[2022-12-19 00:36:11] <%+bstark18> What playlist is this?
[2022-12-19 00:36:20] <%+stackmillz> @352dikyzarc yez its good value
[2022-12-19 00:36:39] <+dmzzzg> Di Maria has too much power
[2022-12-19 00:36:47] <jack_russell67> I was thinking the same thing about corners
[2022-12-19 00:37:06] <%+stackmillz> i would do di ma b4 the icon pack tho
[2022-12-19 00:37:08] <GoatTea07> How did u cancel the power shot?
[2022-12-19 00:37:14] <ryanmarsh807> Is the Rt double tap sprint boost not working for anyone else?
[2022-12-19 00:37:16] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> I would put it lower
[2022-12-19 00:37:22] <%$ItsTr3ple> L2 R2 @GoatTea07
[2022-12-19 00:37:24] <%+MARVELLOO> @352dikyzarc i got 88 lampard from it
[2022-12-19 00:37:26] <ryanmarsh807> Doesn‚Äôt seem responsible at all
[2022-12-19 00:37:27] <+dmzzzg> I usually find it better when they have like 90 power
[2022-12-19 00:37:27] <Creasor24> i put mine further out and curve it so
[2022-12-19 00:37:30] <%+klausssie> 90%
[2022-12-19 00:37:30] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> As in, Id go a touch up on the strike position
[2022-12-19 00:37:34] <+k1eron29> i do it just to the left of the pen spot when its an in swing
[2022-12-19 00:37:38] <+352dikyzarc> @stackmillz people been getting good pulls? or just good for the value??
[2022-12-19 00:37:38] <ryanmarsh807> Maybe need a new controller
[2022-12-19 00:37:46] <+Davidhassall10> You do it so it says inside low then go a bit more down till it changes to curled
[2022-12-19 00:37:57] <+Davidhassall10> Works for me anyways
[2022-12-19 00:38:20] <%+stackmillz> @352dikyzarc good value its pretty cheap for an icon pack
[2022-12-19 00:38:27] <%+kingnovakin> The most effective corner tactic I‚Äôve had this year is leaving it as it is, just moving out a little bit, 3.25 bars. Works best with a big man at the front/near the keeper
[2022-12-19 00:38:35] <Goodfella79> Fair play to ea for that di maria, honestly thought that card would be a an 87 and a 88 sbc
[2022-12-19 00:38:47] <elzfletch03> Came up against a TOTT messi earlier. Powershot from 40 yards out goes in 2nd min. I just quit i had no chance
[2022-12-19 00:39:52] <+philipio1> Di Maria or icon pack if you can only do one?
[2022-12-19 00:40:07] <Creasor24> @elzfletch03 hahahha the goat is real
[2022-12-19 00:40:08] <%+Apple22> his dribbling looks clean
[2022-12-19 00:40:08] <%+stackmillz> what happens wen u go 6-0
[2022-12-19 00:40:14] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> maybe you need to put your spot on the ball a little higher to get a slightly lower trajectory
[2022-12-19 00:40:16] <steele1921> Bargain of the game cycle so far
[2022-12-19 00:40:26] <%+markcheesyy> Its like EA are saying sorry for the shite content with Di Mar
[2022-12-19 00:40:34] <Jaimb0t> Is that Milik any good?
[2022-12-19 00:40:46] <steele1921> Trust Ea to bring the best little bit of World Cup content, after the World Cup is finished
[2022-12-19 00:40:48] <Jaimb0t> Haha thnx
[2022-12-19 00:40:51] <+dmzzzg> Tbh I score my corners with Roberto Carlos, it's just insane

[2022-12-19 01:42:59] <%+markcheesyy> Unreal and I got him in one of those random have a previous player from the other promotions
[2022-12-19 01:43:27] <timsunessson> Paulinha was such a beast for me this week, Thiago Silva for like 40k was also great
[2022-12-19 01:43:38] <+Mxtsoe> over the top through balls are so broken
[2022-12-19 01:44:30] <hochi_mama916> Are you playing 41212(2)?
[2022-12-19 01:44:36] <timsunessson> @Mxtsoe People just spam them even if the pass is not on so annoying because once it works its a goal
[2022-12-19 01:44:36] <memolee1987> Thats shit
[2022-12-19 01:44:55] <%+rishray> @hochi_mama916 4312 i think
[2022-12-19 01:45:02] <%xWhispy> @markcheesyy GGs n a half on that pull! Thinking of maybe buying him, because he will get more upgrades with PSG wins
[2022-12-19 01:45:05] <%+stackmillz> @timsunessson palinha is a beast
[2022-12-19 01:45:06] <lfg_junior> Someone clip that
[2022-12-19 01:45:11] <lfg_junior> !clip
[2022-12-19 01:45:22] <sterudd123> Di Maria is insane man
[2022-12-19 01:45:25] <+felixuta> I think the kick off glitch is back I can't remember which Fifa it was really bad
[2022-12-19 01:45:25] <%$ItsTr3ple> Clip what ?
[2022-12-19 01:45:43] <leepearston0808> They better hurry up and upgrade my orsic
[2022-12-19 01:45:48] <%+markcheesyy> @xWhispy Cheers man. Will he get more upgrades or does he need to get a TOTW himself?
[2022-12-19 01:45:54] <timsunessson> @stackmillz Used him with Brunos orange card and Eriksen, had a lot of fun with my team
[2022-12-19 01:45:55] <lfg_junior> That kick off goal he scored the way nep won the tackle and it went back to him
[2022-12-19 01:46:01] <memolee1987> LUL LUL
[2022-12-19 01:46:01] <mattjfut> How do you do that speed boost looks insane?
[2022-12-19 01:46:04] <hochi_mama916> @Mxtsoe @timsunessson You are absolutely right. The amount of people spamming that. When it works it's a guaranteed goal...
[2022-12-19 01:46:06] <mattjfut> Anyone know?
[2022-12-19 01:46:13] <sterudd123> Bruh
[2022-12-19 01:46:14] <%$istreet98> Great goal
[2022-12-19 01:46:42] <timsunessson> @mattjfut ball roll lb or something i think
[2022-12-19 01:46:42] <%xWhispy> @markcheesyy Think he needs certain amount of wins for an upgrade, there's probably something on futbin about it :)
[2022-12-19 01:46:48] <+felixuta> is baby cech any good/
[2022-12-19 01:46:53] <jack_russell67> that goal was mad lol

[2022-12-19 01:48:26] <jpompeo40> There‚Äôs something weird about the gameplay this weekend. Not sure if you feel the same way. I was getting beat by people that I was absolutely dominating during the course of the game.
[2022-12-19 01:48:34] <%$istreet98> least you're still up after going down twice
[2022-12-19 01:48:36] <jack_russell67> I never thought of going to bed when I'm tired nice 1 dylan

[2022-12-19 01:48:40] <timsunessson> @stackmillz Nice I tried a few games with a full Croatian team but rage quit that idea quickly
[2022-12-19 01:48:41] <jpompeo40> Also I think he‚Äôs capable of deciding when he wants to go to bed lol
[2022-12-19 01:48:45] <benn0_playz> it annoys me how it‚Äôs literally copy paste every year and somehow it gets worse

[2022-12-19 01:50:36] <%xWhispy> @alfiejonss That and also just the random connection where EA just spins a wheel on how sluggish your game is, or so it feels like LUL
[2022-12-19 01:50:47] <%+rishray> think keeper movement just needs to be a lot slower than what it is
[2022-12-19 01:50:48] <timsunessson> @stackmillz Very very true LUL
[2022-12-19 01:50:56] <timiashaolu> Wc forlan or di natale?

[2022-12-19 01:51:41] <julian88205> When dont you play vlavhic insted of milik? @nepenthez
[2022-12-19 01:51:44] <%xWhispy> @timiashaolu Forlan, his height and physicality can prove a major difference in a game

[2022-12-19 01:54:10] <%xWhispy> @timiashaolu Both of them are lethal and brilliant players. For me Di Natale being 5'7 puts me off of him a tad and Forlan havinf that height and physicality and just being a brilliant striker all in all trumps it over Di Natale for me

[2022-12-19 02:14:05] <%+Cavacom> so how can we fix that?
[2022-12-19 02:14:07] <%+kingnovakin> I never get free wins nowadays tbf, they always quit at 0-0 now
[2022-12-19 02:14:09] <miguel_baus> So true. Its a Quick effect
[2022-12-19 02:14:09] <%+stackmillz> do it
[2022-12-19 02:14:13] <%+markcheesyy> Champs on a SUnday is the worst part of the game
[2022-12-19 02:14:15] <%+RELISEDX_> 0-0 is the way, people don¬¥t give wins anymore like they did when this champs structure was released
[2022-12-19 02:14:16] <+saintjimmy1122> Be part of the solution not the problem. @nepenthez
[2022-12-19 02:14:21] <louis_tobicks44> JUST INTRODUCE A WIN OF SOMEONE QUITS EA PLEASE
[2022-12-19 02:14:27] <louis_tobicks44> IF*
[2022-12-19 02:14:27] <+Reklo27> whats this good deed shit?

[2022-12-19 02:14:28] <%+Cavacom> that is the idea
[2022-12-19 02:14:29] <+sergibonga> I got gifted 2 wins and had 5 people quit at 0-0, don‚Äôt know how to feel
[2022-12-19 02:14:29] <+ron_sellick> it's up to us to break the toxic cycle. be the better man
[2022-12-19 02:14:30] <+GazriGazzola> it pisses m e off
[2022-12-19 02:14:33] <%+markcheesyy> If someone clicks the leave game the game should be given to the other person
[2022-12-19 02:14:39] <%+whufcconnor> all EA need to do is give wins even when its 0-0
[2022-12-19 02:14:45] <chillippr21> @louis_tobicks44 ea are morons that's never happening
[2022-12-19 02:14:45] <lilkumquatz> that‚Äôs what happened to me today people were gifting me win so i gifted back but i get we‚Äôre ur coming from
[2022-12-19 02:14:46] <%EasyGriezy> its like when you give way to someone on the road, they are more likely to give way to the next person
[2022-12-19 02:14:49] <%xWhispy> I tend to thank people who actually do give you the win, because it's so rare now
[2022-12-19 02:14:50] <azoooz1342> Chill man
[2022-12-19 02:14:51] <+saintjimmy1122> People always do it to me and it never stops me giving them away.
[2022-12-19 02:14:54] <fitzyyy7> the solution is ea making quitting = opponent getting the win
[2022-12-19 02:14:57] <+shorich3> sometimes it could be they had a a bad run
[2022-12-19 02:15:01] <timsunessson> @azoooz1342 you chill

[2022-12-19 02:15:22] <Jossieboii96> @protein12r Golden goal is boring as hell
[2022-12-19 02:15:23] <louis_tobicks44> If someone quits regardless of the score you should get the win. It‚Äôs that simple ea
[2022-12-19 02:15:23] <StrakkeOtter> @xWhispy i always send a message <3 and i always give away my games, karma excists
[2022-12-19 02:15:26] <%$ItsTr3ple> Think you still on 9 to giveway, so 6-5
[2022-12-19 02:15:28] <+sergibonga> @whufcconnor if they did forced disconnect glitch would come back and the game would be unplayable
[2022-12-19 02:15:36] <%blazer33x> turn the other cheek nep be like jesus

[2022-12-19 02:15:55] <+ron_sellick> there must be a reason EA don't give the win for a draw quit. I read it's something to do with hackers but unsure
[2022-12-19 02:16:04] <%+Cavacom> i does suck when you know the other person doesnt deserve your kindness
[2022-12-19 02:16:16] <+GazriGazzola> same guy that quit at 0-0
[2022-12-19 02:16:20] <%+RELISEDX_> it¬¥s stupid that you don¬¥t get the win if someone literally forfeits
[2022-12-19 02:16:52] <%+rishray> elo so low this is basically squad battles now
[2022-12-19 02:16:54] <%xWhispy> @strakkeotter Same here, because you never know if someone's having a torrid time needing that 1 win. Plus it literally takes no longer giving the wins anyway :D
[2022-12-19 02:17:10] <+LMP_Huayra> Shitters quitting is common
[2022-12-19 02:17:11] <cp09888> i used to do that in drafts in 2017, made like 4m coins &never got banned Kappa
[2022-12-19 02:17:17] <%+kingnovakin> Ea papering over the cracks as per usual
[2022-12-19 02:17:21] <+sergibonga> Fifa 16 or 17, if you went 1-0 you made the opponent quit and if they scored you made the game not count
[2022-12-19 02:17:21] <jack_russell67> why don't they just give u the win if your opponent quits
[2022-12-19 02:17:21] <alib2288> think the reason people quitting early at 0-0 is to do with the time of night on a Sunday.
[2022-12-19 02:17:26] <%+RELISEDX_> they should have fixed that problem instead of ripping people off by giving them nothing
[2022-12-19 02:17:33] <+shorich3> instead its EA severs
[2022-12-19 02:17:34] <+beast68> How u finding Di Maria
[2022-12-19 02:17:41] <%$ItsTr3ple> Unless they griddy
[2022-12-19 02:17:44] <+ron_sellick> so it's just EA being lazy and not fixing it cos it doesn't concern them enough I guess. standard
[2022-12-19 02:17:48] <m4nny1403> Worllddd
[2022-12-19 02:17:50] <BenPegg10> @alib2288 takes 5 secs to score an og

[2022-12-19 02:18:07] <%+Cavacom> i still believe everyone should aim the toxicity at EA and not each other
[2022-12-19 02:18:26] <alib2288> @benpegg10 awww 100%. I gifted 6 games earlier. never get it back though
[2022-12-19 02:18:27] <%+markcheesyy> EA also register is you exit the game and give you the dnf
[2022-12-19 02:18:31] <otto_lfc> How are you finding Di Maria so far nep?!

[2022-12-19 02:19:03] <+ron_sellick> EA would love the toxic behaviour to a degree because it's an engagement factor haha
[2022-12-19 02:19:21] <jack_russell67> could ea just give u the win if your opponent quits
[2022-12-19 02:19:21] <%xWhispy> Anyone here tested out that Tott Thiago Silva? Got him in my picks and he looks decent

[2022-12-19 15:09:27] <+jamieharris_96> Find it weird how the World Cup swaps tokens expire in a few days but we don‚Äôt get the rewards for 2 weeks, very odd
[2022-12-19 15:09:29] <johnterryspants> Will Ronaldo come out the team when World Cup cards leave?
[2022-12-19 15:09:29] <Roboo_95> Oh didn‚Äôt realise you‚Äôd gone to points fair enough
[2022-12-19 15:09:33] <%+howdyitsdavid> @m1lezy at some point you packed his gold card when you should have packed his PTG, it's compensation.
[2022-12-19 15:09:41] <signingpoem9620> you can put Acuna LB

[2022-12-19 15:17:56] <jordddd> Bring back the PC RTG imo
[2022-12-19 15:17:56] <+King_rfz14> @ayosergi0 but viera is a card that you can use until the end of the game, which is going to be hard to find
[2022-12-19 15:17:59] <alperen792> beeebooo
[2022-12-19 15:18:08] <+Yianni33> Sounds like a great idea. I started a month ago after 2 years away. My team is cracked. It‚Äôs easy to build a juiced team this fifa if you know what you‚Äôre doing.
[2022-12-19 15:18:18] <kasperthorhauge> Hey guys. What do we think will happen to the world cup packs once they expire? Have like 20 of them, debatting to save them and see what will happen in the next season
[2022-12-19 15:18:18] <urunclesulcer> mid Shevchenko out my pack ffs
[2022-12-19 15:18:21] <+BourneMyGuy> I love the rtg

[2022-12-19 15:18:31] <stemil19> nepperz, why does div 2 have worse players than div 3, i am already 2 wins away from div 1, after being almost whole season in div 3
[2022-12-19 15:18:32] <+that_anto> nobody cares about the RTG anymore.
[2022-12-19 15:18:35] <vinigem> Finally got Boufal compensation
[2022-12-19 15:18:35] <+BourneMyGuy> Nep that di Maria looks madddd
[2022-12-19 15:18:40] <supermercadotelebancos> I think a weekly rtg is too short, maybe a new rtg at every season
[2022-12-19 15:18:42] <%AHumanAlien> RTG worked in past FIFAs but how they've changed the game, it just doesn't work now. That's nothing against Nep, who does an awesome job. Just the concept is tired.
[2022-12-19 15:18:44] <+BourneMyGuy> @stemil19 me too bro
[2022-12-19 15:18:46] <%+rockmanl0l> i think RTG's died around fifa 20
[2022-12-19 15:18:51] <+Keegan9923> Not sure if anyone will have an attachment/reason to watch a mini series, hope it does bang though!

[2022-12-19 15:19:10] <johnterryspants> Nep do you ever have any fan encounters in public and is so, what are they like?
[2022-12-19 15:19:13] <+JidgeMate> @johnterryspants for some reason i got a free untade boufal rttwc \
[2022-12-19 15:19:16] <stemil19> @BourneMyGuy dude in div 3 i saw full icon/hero teams, meanwhile div 2 gold de bruyne and flippin rodri

[2022-12-19 15:19:29] <%+sanchoviesalt> When do we get our global cup rewards?
[2022-12-19 15:19:33] <%+mrunbeatable13> FYI we only have 1 gold card that's worth more then 100k
[2022-12-19 15:19:36] <+TMaier10> Might as well try something new
[2022-12-19 15:19:38] <%AHumanAlien> Mini series could attach more new viewers.
[2022-12-19 15:19:38] <%sorarejosh> lack of league sbc's / menu content the nail in the coffin for rtg's this yr
[2022-12-19 15:19:41] <+Yianni33> We back you Nep
[2022-12-19 15:19:44] <+that_anto> tbh I do not even check fifa for the 6pm I check your youtube channel
[2022-12-19 15:19:46] <+d_Regs23> gold ney really dropped 60k
[2022-12-19 15:19:47] <+BourneMyGuy> I think the RTG is a really fun but people don‚Äôt have the attention span now a days with it unless there‚Äôs a lot of extra you add in like the 10k team qualifying which you did nep
[2022-12-19 15:19:52] <%M3TA_K> I play on PC, RTG is literally the same, prices are nearly identical to consoles apart from that top 1% players. You can do on PC same thing You can on console in a week.
[2022-12-19 15:19:53] <%russellwalker1977> 100% have to dynamic and not be stagnetn and get left behind.
[2022-12-19 15:19:54] <shaunhutton_2399> Nepenthez did u ever play with the sidemen or any Youtuber Match ü§î Think u did Cant remember
[2022-12-19 15:19:54] <%$istreet98> a guy called Isleepz used to do one of my favourite RTGs back in fifa 12-14. that's when the series meant something as only got 400 coins per match and 2k for a tournament win
[2022-12-19 15:20:02] <danbeanie> Hi how does winter Wildcard work
[2022-12-19 15:20:04] <%lilkumquatz> do u think so many good sbcs and the market drop this early killed rtgs
[2022-12-19 15:20:04] <+Keegan9923> No I just think the fact that it would come to a close after such a short period, let‚Äôs say 5/7 days may cause some people to not be engaged, not me personally but I could see that happening
[2022-12-19 15:20:05] <%$czechmate92576> ive never played minecraft a day in my life,but i watched nep play

[2022-12-19 15:20:25] <+roonest> FIFA '17 RTG was just the purest with SBC's and then the level of achievement attained was worked for. I respect your treatment of your audience not to just pump out the same content years on year fully.
[2022-12-19 15:20:26] [Notification] UJayne1997 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! [Yo nep, long time viewer, since 2011. I think the RTG concept just came to an end. I kind of liked a concept a german Youtuber is doing right now where he creates a new account and shows what he can do in 24 hours of playtime, 48 hours, 3 days, 7 days etc. Kind of an ongoing series. Gets good views aswell and is nice to watch]

[2022-12-19 15:20:30] <Stallone986> maybe EA makes a super fresh game next year that bring back something like RTG

[2022-12-19 15:20:35] <%+howdyitsdavid> Nep, why are you building 75+ WC player packs? Sorry if I missed the reasoning. Just heard you mention it.
[2022-12-19 15:20:40] <danbeanie> Hi how does winter Wildcard work

[2022-12-19 15:20:42] <%+robertovidal46> The 10k Team challenge was nice to watch, I think overall small challenges across the week are more enjoyable to watch then the RTG - using different players etc
[2022-12-19 15:20:43] <RobertOliveira96> @thejoker394 wrong
[2022-12-19 15:20:46] <%+mikekozy23> @jamieharris_96 careful spamming lad

[2022-12-19 15:21:09] <@%CaniSports> time to copy them germans. They been copying us long enough!
[2022-12-19 15:21:12] <+that_anto> @NepentheZ you know whats strange, your last videos were not pushed by youtube thats weird
[2022-12-19 15:21:13] <garritosdorritos> I feel like with the type of videos you're doing at the moment there is a good chance the odd one will get a huge amount of views
[2022-12-19 15:21:20] <danbeanie> Hi how does winter Wildcard work..
[2022-12-19 15:21:24] <stemil19> @BourneMyGuy that matchmaking being diff
[2022-12-19 15:21:25] <stemil19> :D
[2022-12-19 15:21:26] <MobbleYobble> will mbappe rebound or not now?
[2022-12-19 15:21:26] <+Lukeflynn89> RTG is fun to watch, but watching you being able to try the best players and being able to show what you can earn from playing the game in a short space of time is a great concept
[2022-12-19 15:21:28] <thejoker394> wtf neymar was 170k the other day
[2022-12-19 15:21:29] <+snixey> will there be any new world cup swaps? @NepentheZ
[2022-12-19 15:21:43] <+UTDBradleyy> Wait is Winter Wildcards today ??
[2022-12-19 15:21:47] <johnterryspants> How much is Neymar now?
[2022-12-19 15:21:49] <+BourneMyGuy> @stemil19 at least we‚Äôre cruising in div 2/1 LUL
[2022-12-19 15:21:50] <%$UJayne1997> @thejoker394 yeah di maria brought him down
[2022-12-19 15:22:00] <+BourneMyGuy> Ney is around 100k
[2022-12-19 15:22:01] <thejoker394> lol
[2022-12-19 15:22:06] <LadToDad> Do you think people have got a little tired of the same repetitiveness of ultimate team?
[2022-12-19 15:22:07] <+ct_30> God I can‚Äôt wait to get rid of these stupid red World Cup cards.
[2022-12-19 15:22:09] <shaunhutton_2399> @benpegg10 cause his pace is so low neymar, he was only good at shooting on FIFA when u had a sitter like basically a 1 on 1
[2022-12-19 15:22:10] <+that_anto> thats sound cool
[2022-12-19 15:22:15] <+BourneMyGuy> Di Maria makes me so happy for him as a player
[2022-12-19 15:22:20] <johnterryspants> @bournemyguy So glad I didn‚Äôt buy last weekend then lol
[2022-12-19 15:22:20] <%AHumanAlien> I like the promo showcase idea. Would be good to compare how you do with each promo team on a leaderboard
[2022-12-19 15:22:23] <azeem453> Hey nep how‚Äôs it going
[2022-12-19 15:22:28] <+Yianni33> I‚Äôve hit that point you mentioned earlier. Got to a level that‚Äôs good but will take forever to upgrade to the best players
[2022-12-19 15:22:39] <%+danarlli> I like the idea. Are you planning on doing it for the WW promo?
[2022-12-19 15:22:44] <%robo_cfc> basically just re skins since then
[2022-12-19 15:22:45] <%s_embo> what is the point of creating an account to show a promo ? surely you just buy the players on the same account ? creating an account to load fifa points on for a promo sort of pointless no ?
[2022-12-19 15:22:47] <+BourneMyGuy> Nep have you felt like a skillitus video, pure skills all fun LUL :)
[2022-12-19 15:22:48] <%+Kieran96cfc> it just been made easier every year really
[2022-12-19 15:22:54] <+ConnorEvans11> I think this game would be good with league sbc and monthly rewards
[2022-12-19 15:22:57] <+jamieharris_96> Good idea, but most people have already started new accounts already at the start of the game, it won‚Äôt relate to the main fifa community, but worth a try
[2022-12-19 15:23:00] <%+leonciozamora11> Dude those be tactics are fun. I score way more goals
[2022-12-19 15:23:15] <curtisgiles> this has to be the earliest since fifa 17 i feel the game is "dead" im grinding cod shipnent more than i ever have in my life because fifa is shit
[2022-12-19 15:23:15] <curlyrico> of course i want fifa to be better, but if its still bad imma still play it and other will too
[2022-12-19 15:23:17] <+ct_30> Totw is in a massive need of a revamp, it‚Äôs just so pointless these days
[2022-12-19 15:23:20] <@%+Owen_Slater> Ive had that new not allowed to buy account for 1 week and Im already thinking about saving for TOTY. Its ridiculous
[2022-12-19 15:23:26] <%AHumanAlien> What's the plan with the channels going forward. Is new stuff on RTG channel and 6pm stuff still on main channel
[2022-12-19 15:23:28] <azeem453> I‚Äôm hoping EA release some decent swaps like an icon or hero pack
[2022-12-19 15:23:29] <%$ollieware96> I've just come back from a month off and I'm actually really enjoying the game, my team was well behind the curve but after only a couple of days my team is good enough to compete again
[2022-12-19 15:23:29] <+jayden_joshua21> Hope you‚Äôre good Nep! Just got home from work and seen the Di Maria dynamic, massive W
[2022-12-19 15:23:33] <+BourneMyGuy> I‚Äôm saving for toty now
[2022-12-19 15:23:35] <stemil19> @BourneMyGuy i am wondering if i should go to div 1, cuz of swaps, if they are sbmm, after reset i would be like div 2-3 on the start
[2022-12-19 15:23:39] <kierondrake> Yo Nep, hope you're good!
[2022-12-19 15:23:39] <maxwellb0> cant wait for my xmas fodder
[2022-12-19 15:23:39] <+tool1975> you'll qualify anyway, so just have fun.
[2022-12-19 15:23:41] <%+jaythemillerman> I conceded more aswell but its definitely getting me more goals
[2022-12-19 15:23:41] <johnterryspants> The whole concept of fifa has changed since back in the day. Seems like it‚Äôs so competitive now it feels more like a chore to play nowadays.
[2022-12-19 15:23:41] <%$istreet98> I think its a good concept. create a new account on the Monday, see what you can get for the new promo on Friday and then end the mini series on making a team with the most amount of new promo cards you can fit in. and potentially take that into champs. and imo this would be the perfect day to start as winter wildcards has swaps too.
[2022-12-19 15:23:45] <+jamieharris_96> That is true yeah
[2022-12-19 15:23:45] <%$mcburnie100> Love you Nep thanks for all the streams and content <3
[2022-12-19 15:23:46] <Qnxsty> I started a new RTG yesterday tbf
[2022-12-19 15:23:46] <LadToDad> What do you think needs to change in your opinion? I just think we've become so content driven which sadly takes away from the gameplay so when they don't drop any "content" we all say the game is dead
[2022-12-19 15:23:47] <%s_embo> tbf most people who watch fifa youtube probably already have the game
[2022-12-19 15:23:48] <drac_in_da_house> december huge sale
[2022-12-19 15:23:57] <FrancoJavierM> I bought FIFA 22 at the start of TOTS LUL . I'm your example Nep

[2022-12-19 15:24:25] <%$istreet98> @nepenthez I think its a good concept. create a new account on the Monday, see what you can get for the new promo on Friday and then end the mini series on making a team with the most amount of new promo cards you can fit in. and potentially take that into champs. and imo this would be the perfect day to start as winter wildcards has swaps too.
[2022-12-19 15:24:30] <%+wardy11xx> gold walker or TOTT dalot?
[2022-12-19 15:24:30] <+slang608> u cant start a new account on the same device if u have too many

[2022-12-19 15:24:49] <+Yianni33> Annoying to come up against Al Owaran etc in rivals with a team just below the power curb. But more fun to use players you can relate to and actually like

[2022-12-19 15:27:09] <%light_hut> It'll be a lot harder when the world cup players expire though. They've made starting RTGs a lot easier
[2022-12-19 15:27:13] <johnterryspants> FIFA stopped being fun when you couldn‚Äôt use Silver/Skill teams because it became too sweaty and competitive IMO
[2022-12-19 15:27:15] <BenPegg10> What, done an icon pack and got someone better than I got in my 5 icon packs, all depends on your luck, my team is shit and it‚Äôs because I‚Äôve dumped fodder into packs to try and get something and got fuck all
[2022-12-19 15:27:19] <%+howdyitsdavid> But this requires being a really good player, no?
[2022-12-19 15:27:23] <%johnfive21> SO he pakced 4 Tott? that seems ridiculous

[2022-12-19 15:28:18] <+florin1923> Better than CR7?
[2022-12-19 15:28:20] <stevedip> I started an RTG around vieira last week and got 11 wins with a pretty cheeks team

[2022-12-19 15:28:23] <curtisgiles> a good series for youtube would be staying in div 5 and finishing every weekend league with 5 win quali and 11 wins in champs for 1 month and see what happens @NepentheZ

[2022-12-19 15:29:02] <+giuseppe_esq> It may not take much effort if you haven‚Äôt got a job, or other responsibilities, and can grind the game for hours each day.  It‚Äôs a bit tougher when you‚Äôre self employed, have kids, and are lucky to play for 1-2 hours per day max.
[2022-12-19 15:29:03] <%$mcburnie100> Swaps as well maybe

[2022-12-19 15:30:10] <%+davidanderson20> They need to bring back the grind element to the next fifa its dying earlier and earlier every year due ti easy rewards

[2022-12-19 15:30:28] <+BYCakes> I like the idea, I just think there will be a lot of tedious low level rivals to qualify for champs
[2022-12-19 15:30:28] <%$nelsonscolumn77> Loving the sound of this content, will bring the excitement back with packs and sbc building
[2022-12-19 15:30:33] <2_tap_> Just an idea but isnt something like ‚Äúroad to r9‚Äù or to a really high end player isnt something to grind for and which engages viewers?
[2022-12-19 15:30:40] <+UTDBradleyy> It‚Äôs actually crazy how easy an RTG is now
[2022-12-19 15:30:40] <+florin1923> I played this WL only 15 games...becaus 5 was donation :))
[2022-12-19 15:30:57] <%sorarejosh> they've gotta change fut champs somehow to make it worthwhile to push from that 95% to 100% team

[2022-12-19 15:31:01] <%+riff_hunter44> @AHumanAlien At this point in fifa it wouldnt be that hard with all thats available really
[2022-12-19 15:31:02] <FrancoJavierM> it would be cool if you did a 2-hour limit on grinding the new account. because I'm just thinking and assuming most casuals are playing 2 hours max of FIFA. i could be wrong tho
[2022-12-19 15:31:03] <%nate321johnson> @johnterryspants same bro glad i saved fodder tho did di Maria hopefully I‚Äôll be able to get sum fodder to do the 88+

[2022-12-19 15:32:05] <%+davidanderson20> Best days of fifa was when u could use silvers and golds and still compete with those using totys etc it was so fun
[2022-12-19 15:32:07] <%nate321johnson> @johnterryspants jus always been a di Maria fan had too

[2022-12-19 15:32:24] <%+danarlli> At the end of the day for me it‚Äôs a game so just have fun. I think a lot of your core fan base watch your content because of you rather than the actual content itself
[2022-12-19 15:32:26] <%+rockmanl0l> the thing is i have a 95% team and i dont play rivals or Champs, i only do Squad battles and friendlies
[2022-12-19 15:32:27] <%+howdyitsdavid> damn I've spent like a month's mortgage on FIFA points. haha. Owen has shown me the light.
[2022-12-19 15:32:27] <+TMaier10> The problem is there‚Äôs no incentive to grind past 8 wins on rivals and 11 wins in champs. They need to rework the rewards

[2022-12-19 15:32:29] <%+ulaulalau> i spent 3mil coins on Packs because this Game is boring to Play and in the Menu there ist nothing to do
[2022-12-19 15:32:30] <mrphilliplesh> Agree thsts why I did Ronaldo. Just for fun. He‚Äôs incredibly overpriced but he‚Äôs always very overpowered. Id never have done it in previous years. Gotta find a way to enjoy this game‚Ä¶it‚Äôs so boring
[2022-12-19 15:32:32] <rafixms> i like this way, not every person spend hours in the game per day, and this way they can have some good players

[2022-12-19 15:32:44] <+dbabbs87> out of interest why is it a bad thing that an RTG is now easier ? also in terms of games, we say we don't want it easy but then if we get matched against tough opponents we also moan. catch 22 for everyone it seems

[2022-12-19 15:40:44] <+ullzie> The sopranos is elite
[2022-12-19 15:40:46] <%s_embo> i disagree with your point here . the greatest shows of all time are not 2-3 seasons
[2022-12-19 15:40:46] <%+bongyyyyy> Prison break was about 24 episodes a season and the best ever
[2022-12-19 15:40:47] <mattys517> the sopranos goated
[2022-12-19 15:40:57] <%+dillon634> Prison break was a bit long for me
[2022-12-19 15:40:58] <%+futbolistic97> @DavisPlayzz Get a VPN and you can watch content in other countries
[2022-12-19 15:41:00] <%sorarejosh> thats why im suprised soaps still exist
[2022-12-19 15:41:04] <%+thegoslow> yeah global attention span has dropped considerably due to tiktok
[2022-12-19 15:41:10] <sapticz> best striker for 200k any help plz ??
[2022-12-19 15:41:10] <P0rkMissile> Also, a lot of shows do like midseason breaks now. Where they break up the seasons into two parts
[2022-12-19 15:41:15] <shaunhutton_2399> u need to love the characters like the TV programs back in the day
[2022-12-19 15:41:15] <KyrJackUK> Last of us tv show next month
[2022-12-19 15:41:16] <+plantedwharf545> @bongyyyyy Only season 1 was great though, the others were full of filler and boring mainly
[2022-12-19 15:41:17] <curlyrico> omg the di maria card art
[2022-12-19 15:41:17] <johnterryspants> Depends on the quality of the writing I guess.
[2022-12-19 15:41:18] <%+allan_saint_minimum> ppl need instant gratification now
[2022-12-19 15:41:20] <+lukaSIvI> capitalism
[2022-12-19 15:41:23] <vvvjonesyvvv> yeah tik tok generation thrives on a thrill a minute
[2022-12-19 15:41:23] <%+bongyyyyy> @sorarejosh leave corrie out of this üòÇ
[2022-12-19 15:41:25] <TR11PN> everyone has a short attention span these days and not enough time.
[2022-12-19 15:41:27] <%+riff_hunter44> Check out some of Two Syncs content from a few weeks ago It was hilarious Comedy works
[2022-12-19 15:41:27] <%$DavisPlayzz> @futbolistic97 yh thats an option, swear it would buffer loads tho
[2022-12-19 15:41:30] <+Levi0802> Yeah true, people nowadays have also 0 concentration (mostly) because of their phones. They need constant dopamine.
[2022-12-19 15:41:31] <Stallone986> fingers crossed EA does something fresh next year. Content creators are important
[2022-12-19 15:41:35] <%The_Nines_> The age of adhd
[2022-12-19 15:41:38] <Brady2109> Resident Alien is a cracking show.
[2022-12-19 15:41:42] <+tool1975> for the short attention span generation
[2022-12-19 15:41:44] <%$kinglester2692> can't believe you did cr7
[2022-12-19 15:41:45] <%nate321johnson> A lot of followers these days

[2022-12-19 15:41:47] <PhusionTV> people like quick content nowadays
[2022-12-19 15:41:49] <spencej13> Benzene has just retired from France
[2022-12-19 15:41:53] <+ConnorEvans11> do you think this game can be saved or do you think its done for?
[2022-12-19 15:41:56] <vvvjonesyvvv> it is attention span, the algorithm for tik tok kills people's brain
[2022-12-19 15:42:00] <%$kinglester2692> age of instant gratification
[2022-12-19 15:42:00] <%+bongyyyyy> Too much to watch that‚Äôs the problem
[2022-12-19 15:42:01] <+BourneMyGuy> @sapticz cr7
[2022-12-19 15:42:05] <+JidgeMate> i need 13k xp for paredes, and ive done all the week objs to get xp but i think ill be short by like 3k xp, anyway to get more xp b4 thurs??
[2022-12-19 15:42:06] <azeem453> Di Maria dynamic image is sick
[2022-12-19 15:42:13] <%$coys51> the was 4 tv channels when i was growing up lol
[2022-12-19 15:42:18] <%lilkumquatz> i think it‚Äôs mostly due to lack of original content in the general field of entertainment since everything has been done
[2022-12-19 15:42:24] <TekkersJR> the di maria image looks so good.
[2022-12-19 15:42:25] <%+thegoslow> and then pros are creating content
[2022-12-19 15:42:27] <%+robertovidal46> Overall overwhelming content, so much to see with all the recommendations to similar channels/content
[2022-12-19 15:42:28] <+BourneMyGuy> I‚Äôm glad I took paredes from seasons
[2022-12-19 15:42:30] <scottx45445> Kids use to watch cartoons now they have a choice of 7 billion youtube videos
[2022-12-19 15:42:32] <%+big_mcmatt> Neppo, I was trying to remember if you ever did a midnight hour podcast with Eldinero?
[2022-12-19 15:42:33] <P0rkMissile> I don't think it's like a generational thing either. There's just so much content available and people want to take it all in, so they can't waste hours on one thing when they want to watch other things too
[2022-12-19 15:42:35] <+Lukeflynn89> Tune this
[2022-12-19 15:42:35] <%+bongyyyyy> Sometimes I sat with laptop TV and phone watching 3 things at once
[2022-12-19 15:42:40] <%+JakeKett96> japes?
[2022-12-19 15:42:41] <CagnusNikaru> exactly to many options to choose from, and find exactly the type of content that you like and are interested in
[2022-12-19 15:42:44] <+TMaier10> Zwe
[2022-12-19 15:42:55] <%nate321johnson> @coys51 u old af cat 4 channels
[2022-12-19 15:42:56] <cheers12333> new sheriff tweet nep
[2022-12-19 15:43:05] <%$Jamesnewton8> plus the other platforms too
[2022-12-19 15:43:08] <here4rewards_> 300 viewer pie streams were elite in fifa 17
[2022-12-19 15:43:13] <%johnfive21> aand only 3 english streams
[2022-12-19 15:43:21] <+Teddable> I personally do think that tik tok has trained a lot of people to have short attention spans
[2022-12-19 15:43:25] <%The_Nines_> It‚Äôs a feedback loop of short form content creating an expectation of instant gratification. Once you train your brain on that you can‚Äôt ingest long form content as easily.
[2022-12-19 15:43:31] <+titolivio85> yup, that's what i am going to do now
[2022-12-19 15:43:36] <%$istreet98> castro is the king at delaying content but keeping people interested
[2022-12-19 15:43:37] <Stallone986> loyal viewers!
[2022-12-19 15:43:44] <+Yianni33> It‚Äôs also very expensive for show runners to have 20-30 eps
[2022-12-19 15:43:45] <johnterryspants> Mate when I first started watching your channel there was only a few like AntoHolland, Joshflip and the skiller channels like Ralle and R9Rai. Now there‚Äôs hundreds
[2022-12-19 15:43:49] <%$coys51> Yep the was only 4 tv channels when I was young lol
[2022-12-19 15:43:54] <%johnfive21> Not only RTG. Almost every episodic content on YT is dead
[2022-12-19 15:43:55] <%$kinglester2692> instant gratification
[2022-12-19 15:43:57] <%+thegoslow> @NepentheZ Maybe non ultimate team content is due a comeback
[2022-12-19 15:44:02] <%+riff_hunter44> I love your long form vids
[2022-12-19 15:44:10] <+ConnorEvans11> do you think this game can be saved or do you think its done for?
[2022-12-19 15:44:13] <barnsey93> Adeyemis army is great tbf
[2022-12-19 15:44:24] <forzeferde> howcome the youtube live stream ended Nep? are you streaming on Twitch from now on?
[2022-12-19 15:44:25] <%AHumanAlien> @Yianni33 They can also get top tier film stars to sign up for a 8-10 series rather than a 30 ep for 7 years
[2022-12-19 15:44:29] <+craigyestlea> What about a co-op series to glory 2 ppl start new account. Did it with my mate now enjoy playing rtg more than main
[2022-12-19 15:44:36] <+BourneMyGuy> Passion fc?
[2022-12-19 15:44:36] <+Jhaytch1> What is winter wildcards? I
[2022-12-19 15:44:41] <pablokruk> boufal is about 60K and as good as Di Maria, or similar
[2022-12-19 15:44:43] <Stallone986> do we think EA are going to scale back in the next game?
[2022-12-19 15:44:45] <m_silky> Why don‚Äôt you do a play centric rtg?
[2022-12-19 15:44:49] <%lilkumquatz> almost everything has already been done so it‚Äôs hard to make stuff new and intresting
[2022-12-19 15:44:49] <+Levi0802> Both is true tbf. TikTok is also booming because they can constantly scroll and search for the dopamine release they desire.
[2022-12-19 15:44:49] <+gardenerpete2003> the change Nep is the new games on the horizon,competition for ea thank god..

[2022-12-19 15:45:02] <+jacknolson__> i think it has to be a 1 episode story telling type vid
[2022-12-19 15:45:05] <m_silky> And only spend 2 hours a day on it during the week and unlimited on the weekend?
[2022-12-19 15:45:06] <%AHumanAlien> That seems like a nice cadence over a few days

[2022-12-19 15:45:40] <c1dotloose> Why do you look at leaks, you just ruin it for yourself, don‚Äôt you think?
[2022-12-19 15:45:41] <forzeferde> are we expecting a team released tonight Nep?

[2022-12-19 15:54:13] <+selim_dxb> nepenthez, is it worth getting brolins wc hero or should i just buy his normal
[2022-12-19 15:54:13] <skillz166477> Would be fun if you spend a lot of money on your main account and build like a full on meta team with Mbappe, toure, lucio etc and see how well you do in champs
[2022-12-19 15:54:28] <LeroiJackson> do you make money on sorare?
[2022-12-19 15:54:29] <forzeferde> is it worth going on fifa at 6pm nep?

[2022-12-19 15:56:33] <m4nny1403> !old gen
[2022-12-19 15:56:34] <+itscallum2005> @selim_dxb ofc hes very fast, great dribbling and feels responsive. his body type is quite nice this year even at his hight. shooting is solid on both feet as he now has the 4 star WF. id say the only cons is his strength and 83 balance in pressure situations. also hes better out wide then through the middle
[2022-12-19 15:56:34] <%jjaden10> But fodder was running low
[2022-12-19 15:56:35] <neil1989> are u suprised we have 2 token promos out at the same time nep ?

[2022-12-19 15:57:34] <+selim_dxb> @itscallum2005 so its better to play him out wide than like a cam position
[2022-12-19 15:57:34] <m4nny1403> Chat showdown Correa or baby puskas
[2022-12-19 15:57:35] <azeem453> Does Correa still match the value though
[2022-12-19 15:57:36] <+TurtlesHeadsPopinOut> Showdown Bergwijn and Correa together are naughty

[2022-12-19 15:58:27] <+itscallum2005> @selim_dxb yes i'd say so. ive used him in every attacking position and found him better out wide on the left for the outside foot
[2022-12-19 15:58:41] <%+stackmillz> whats up nep the stream was so fun last nite
[2022-12-19 15:58:41] <ilias24k> @jrow19 you were playing against coop

[2022-12-19 15:58:50] <leunamand> @jrow19 That happens if somebody plays coop. Your rivals were probably two players
[2022-12-19 15:58:56] <%+00_SW33TCHiiNMUSiiC__> I changed most of my team go get showdown Enzo and Correa to fit in, absolutely love them, got 11-1 champs, best ever record

[2022-12-19 16:30:09] <HandleEase> Are you the real Nepenthez?
[2022-12-19 16:30:58] <@%Viperlization> I wanted it to cover Acuna on the screen
[2022-12-19 16:31:05] <%$istreet98> I packed that card, only turned fifa on for 1 hour the whole game and got him
[2022-12-19 16:31:09] <%jjaden10> Put the 98 Acuna overtop of the 88 Acuna card @viperlization
[2022-12-19 16:31:13] <+Siiimply> just put his futbin stats
[2022-12-19 16:31:18] <liamxtank> It looks cheap. Don‚Äôt mean that is in quality, it just doesn‚Äôt appeal or pop.

[2022-12-19 16:33:46] <DGGWRLD> You should focus on making first 30-60sec bomb rather than waste time on mid-video edits

[2022-12-19 16:34:04] <@%Viperlization> I did the funny with Emi
[2022-12-19 16:34:06] <fordykyle1> any reason you want all this extra stuff included?
[2022-12-19 16:34:06] <%BobbyTambling> I think a share-screen discrod session would do you guys wonder
[2022-12-19 16:34:12] <%Dezalleycat> Benzema has retired from international football,chances of an EOE ?
[2022-12-19 16:34:12] <%+riff_hunter44> Thats why you need to do it Nep
[2022-12-19 16:34:19] <+iaincampbell1301> Hey Nep, can you please tell me is a sub get any chemistry, whether it‚Äôs worth using a chem style on subs
[2022-12-19 16:34:32] <@CaniSports> Thing is he has a script he goes after while you just talk
[2022-12-19 16:34:37] <@%Viperlization> I guess the thing was I just didn't want to over edit
[2022-12-19 16:34:42] <zaraankhan200> your not even waffling about Enzo in that video nep, it's a great video tbh
[2022-12-19 16:34:51] <+tsentinho> Hi Nep, will you do any holiday special draft challenge this year?
[2022-12-19 16:34:52] <%+Supplecactus> Personally I don‚Äôt like the many jumps, it‚Äôs very robotic

[2022-12-19 16:35:09] <+jongray98> Would it worth trailing a couple of new editors to get your vision for a vid?
[2022-12-19 16:35:14] <callec18> Nep triggered?
[2022-12-19 16:35:27] <%$ItsTr3ple> Wtf are you saying @callec18
[2022-12-19 16:35:34] <%$istreet98> Overediting for me is too many memes where it becomes tedious and unfunny
[2022-12-19 16:35:37] <%+Supplecactus> @itstr3ple don‚Äôt give him the attention mate

[2022-12-19 16:36:03] <callec18> Nothing wrong with your current editing
[2022-12-19 16:36:07] <zaraankhan200> u should be proud of the video ur making
[2022-12-19 16:36:15] <%+Arkuvio> Great example there Nep
[2022-12-19 16:36:16] <rubz3n> the reason I like your content is because they don't have any unnecessary fluf
[2022-12-19 16:36:33] <freysi123> great for those with adhd LUL
[2022-12-19 16:36:33] <+rokerjoker_> Its for a young audience. Too hyper for my old brain
[2022-12-19 16:36:34] <%AHumanAlien> @jongray98 After a job?
[2022-12-19 16:36:49] <%$UJayne1997> tbf your target audience is probably 10 years older on average :D
[2022-12-19 16:36:52] <@%Viperlization> Understood
[2022-12-19 16:36:53] <+jondontattiescone> nep, I much prefer the tranditional editing. As much as I love Danny Aarons etc, this type of over editing distracts from the content. you are the OG. You are the goat of fifa content, that's your USP. Maybe I'm getting old in the fifa scene and outdated!
[2022-12-19 16:37:04] <vIInFamousx> Good afternoon Nep!
[2022-12-19 16:37:10] <+rokerjoker_> Sounds like you have been on sugar
[2022-12-19 16:37:11] <zaraankhan200> why
[2022-12-19 16:37:13] <@%Viperlization> Alright, understand
[2022-12-19 16:37:22] <zaraankhan200> why remove it
[2022-12-19 16:37:24] <callec18> Your current editing is literally fine
[2022-12-19 16:37:48] <zaraankhan200> why remove it, keep it
[2022-12-19 16:37:54] <+rokerjoker_> On that speed you have the same energy as Skillz
[2022-12-19 16:38:05] <%divkush> @callec18 lil bot
[2022-12-19 16:38:16] <@%Viperlization> Do you want me to redo it?
[2022-12-19 16:38:28] <fancysummerr> makes sense, for the general viewer experience
[2022-12-19 16:38:33] <%BobbyTambling> with your videos I think that people watch them more for what you're actually talking about rather than mr beast's edits, but that's just me. like i know what the 6pm content is, but i always watch your videos at 6pm cos u usually have something interesting to say
[2022-12-19 16:38:34] <byyynido> HyperCrown
[2022-12-19 16:38:44] <fancysummerr> not for the genuine fan tho :)
[2022-12-19 16:38:47] <%+OhSxnch> So like the old cut com style editing just spiced up a bit?
[2022-12-19 16:38:49] <%alminac2> To be fair a lot of your extra commentary is what people like, don‚Äôt cut too much out

[2022-12-19 16:39:00] <callec18> I didn‚Äôt mean triggered all I mean is that I think this ‚Äúcomplain‚Äù is unnecessary
[2022-12-19 16:39:01] <%+athletico_pathetico> feel like this editing is pandering to the youth, when your audience is older
[2022-12-19 16:39:06] <%AHumanAlien> Tightening up the editing is a good idea its not a massive change
[2022-12-19 16:39:16] <Thehawkman14> Its hard for a editor to get your style through his editing
[2022-12-19 16:39:17] <%BobbyTambling> @callec18 what are you on about...

[2022-12-19 16:39:55] <%+markcheesyy> Complaining üôà
[2022-12-19 16:39:55] <%$istreet98> How do you like the draft edits? I like occasional meme and think its balanced right. Too many takes away from the video
[2022-12-19 16:39:59] <%FUTDAN26> I think the problem isn‚Äôt you it‚Äôs a general lack of anything interesting on fifa this year
[2022-12-19 16:40:05] <%nelsonscolumn77> This is not a complaint, it is you trying to make the best of your content and advise Viper how you like to see it
[2022-12-19 16:40:05] <ringo_ringstad> i think these Derek anecdotes would make for great animated shorts tbh

[2022-12-19 16:40:56] <%BobbyTambling> Cheer100 i feel like your vides are also a bit difficult to edit/cut, because i think people watch your videos for what you're actually saying, rather than some smooth transitions. like i always watch the 6pm videos, even though i know the 6pm content, the stuff you say is what makes it interesting, at least imo

[2022-12-19 16:42:02] <zaraankhan200> why u think ur videos are bad, but it looks fine to me when I watch it, that my opinion tbh
[2022-12-19 16:42:09] <%CfcDre02> True, I watch your vids as podcasts like. Not for the visual per-say
[2022-12-19 16:42:14] <%$ItsTr3ple> For us it's a video to watch, for you it's litteraly livelihood, if you feel you need a change or an improvment, that's not on us to say anything
[2022-12-19 16:42:16] <%+keisarikivi> Nep go back and watch fifa 15 player reviews, think those videos from you were brilliant
[2022-12-19 16:42:22] <Stallone986> i think a lot of people that watch are watching for your advise
[2022-12-19 16:42:26] <Stallone986> advice
[2022-12-19 16:42:28] <byyynido> One thing I really miss about your YouTube vids are when you answered a few questions from the comments!
[2022-12-19 16:42:30] <+rokerjoker_> If you stand still you risk going backwards. Nothing wrong with trying to evolve
[2022-12-19 16:42:35] <%+iamterry1997> Yoo nep when does sorare rewards come out? Is it tomorrow?
[2022-12-19 16:42:38] <%BobbyTambling> but have your numbers been going down in the past months or why are you transitioning to your focus on better edits?
[2022-12-19 16:42:39] <maddannyboi> Are u sus
[2022-12-19 16:42:48] <%$DavisPlayzz> i think different type of videos require different type of editing, like i fully agree with more cuts/transitions in player reviews, where as 6pm content is where i personally love the longer more "raw" videos
[2022-12-19 16:42:48] <%+roonest> Evolution not revolution, this industry literally never stands still. A video from 6 years in it's time is viewed so differently in today's light.
[2022-12-19 16:42:49] <callec18> I would say that if you‚Äôre editing it more you are targeting a younger audience

[2022-12-19 16:44:24] <%alminac2> The reason why I started watching you more than other streamers is the quality of your commentary, which is why I follow on twitch too, I‚Äôm sure a lot would agree

[2022-12-19 16:45:02] <charlieb110> Hi nep u ok m8?
[2022-12-19 16:45:06] <%$TraFFi_csgo> people who say "we watch you ONLY because of you" are wrong imo. unless you are a god like KSI, XQC or Speed, not every content creator is capable of turning a shit game/content into a good video. most content creators i watch a good at certain things, just like normal humans, but when the environment changes, they have to change as well.
[2022-12-19 16:45:24] <jpompeo40> I would definitely listen to a podcast from you lol
[2022-12-19 16:45:25] <jefe95> are you ever going to restart your podcast?
[2022-12-19 16:45:25] <%sorarejosh> i defo think a regular podcast would bang on ur channel
[2022-12-19 16:45:31] <+Rebzy__voxz> do podcasts really affect your fifa videos?
[2022-12-19 16:45:38] <callec18> Start a podcast lad
[2022-12-19 16:45:40] <%+derrickp_13> hey nep hows it going buddy hopefully you have a good day hope you and the fam are doing well bro
[2022-12-19 16:45:51] <%CfcDre02> I also think it‚Äôs because of the switches of platforms, if you stayed on twitch throughout your numbers would be way higher on twitch
[2022-12-19 16:45:51] <ron_from_duluth> I like your Twitch stream because you will talk shit back to the chat, including me. You seem like a regular dude who is having fun with FIFA
[2022-12-19 16:45:53] <%BobbyTambling> lol i never realised that, no wonder I listen to so many audible books & podcasts like Joe Rogan & Crouch's one
[2022-12-19 16:45:54] <maddannyboi> Expand you platform
[2022-12-19 16:45:55] <elportuguese> I used to watch every video religiously, then FIFA stopped being enjoyable, stopped playing, despite that kept watching, but as time goes by, the "older" audience stops playing and therefore watching. The younger generation I think are just brainwashed for hyped short stints of content. I think the solution is about capturing the new audience joining the scene
[2022-12-19 16:45:59] <Symrock> I'd listen to a podcast with you and Nick
[2022-12-19 16:46:13] <zaraankhan200> does that entertainment for views nep
[2022-12-19 16:46:23] <%$Rocastle78> 'The Show' reboot. Episode one: Charlie Patino!
[2022-12-19 16:46:23] <%$istreet98> Do you need to do draft to glory? Based off your RTG theory you've reached the glory. So why continue DTG when you could be doing something else?
[2022-12-19 16:46:24] <%AHumanAlien> You always have really engaging conversations on stream, have you thought about doing more collabs and social gaming
[2022-12-19 16:46:35] <%+mike431999> thats the thing i meant too with my massage earlier. I juts love that u chil talk etc. Its like my favorite podcast
[2022-12-19 16:46:44] <%sorarejosh> do you miss having someone like toby in the office, like it was pre-covid
[2022-12-19 16:46:52] <+jondontattiescone> nep, would you like to make the transition from streamer to a more mainstream celeb? tv, podcast, brand appearances etc
[2022-12-19 16:46:53] <$justbeingjames_> I used to watch you like 10 years back for a good few years and when I got back into fifa or if I ever wanted to see what was happening on fifa you have always been my go to creator - good insight into the game, good banter etc etc, keep up the great work dude
[2022-12-19 16:46:55] <callec18> Not the dream when you have a family at the same time maybe
[2022-12-19 16:47:19] <%+derrickp_13> well i know wasnt it like a year or 2 ago when you and nick after playing f1 had this long sort of a podcast talking about fifa that was really cool
[2022-12-19 16:47:32] <+shorich3> they make it sound like you aint got a family to provide for
[2022-12-19 16:47:36] <%$istreet98> Pub Neppo playing minecraft]
[2022-12-19 16:47:36] <HIPPO_________> when your job is their hobby it's hard for us to compute you're working
[2022-12-19 16:47:37] <%+stackmillz> honestly last nites stream was so good and it started from 6 games to 1 guy being toxic to u getting 11 wins that was so great
[2022-12-19 16:47:37] <alfreddavidssonn> How do you do DTG different though?
[2022-12-19 16:47:41] <%$ItsTr3ple> Best way to look at things imo
[2022-12-19 16:47:42] <maddannyboi> Shit content from fifa to be honest
[2022-12-19 16:47:43] <%+roonest> Imposter syndrome?
[2022-12-19 16:47:48] <ceres_ii> fifa 16 was mad popular
[2022-12-19 16:47:50] <zaraankhan200> na, ur good
[2022-12-19 16:47:51] <Stallone986> glory days
[2022-12-19 16:48:03] <ceres_ii> peak times
[2022-12-19 16:48:04] BITS: BobbyTambling (100)
[2022-12-19 16:48:04] <%BobbyTambling> Cheer100 I think you're being hard on yourself, the harsh reality is actually that you've grinded your ass off and you're still interacting with the community you created 6 days before christmas in your office, and outside the office you have a family that loves you, and a community that awaits your next stream/videos when you come back
[2022-12-19 16:48:11] <Stallone986> F8TAL!!
[2022-12-19 16:48:14] <+shorich3> soo you think you got too comfortable now ?
[2022-12-19 16:48:16] <maddannyboi> People stop liking you üòÇüòÇ
[2022-12-19 16:48:27] <+TurtlesHeadsPopinOut> you have to change with the times whatever they are
[2022-12-19 16:48:27] <%$istreet98> Do you need to do draft to glory? Based off your RTG theory you've reached the glory. So why continue DTG when you could be doing something else?
[2022-12-19 16:48:29] <zaraankhan200> ur been harsh to urself
[2022-12-19 16:48:31] <%$petejb1990> What I‚Äôve always wondered about being a streamer is do you find it odd that you‚Äôre talking to lots of people who aren‚Äôt verbally replying? Or perhaps maybe at the beginning of your streaming/YouTube days?
[2022-12-19 16:48:33] <@CaniSports> but then again back then we probably had like 50 creators for fifa worldwide
[2022-12-19 16:48:34] <stemil19> what a response xD
[2022-12-19 16:48:36] <sirwukas> i watch u for 2 reason; 1 . i try learn english:) and 2. and i love fifa:)
[2022-12-19 16:48:45] <Gillzo> afternoon lads
[2022-12-19 16:48:47] <%BobbyTambling> i doubt you can hate someone who is so productive with an elf
[2022-12-19 16:48:48] <+fisher598> its fine nep i love u
[2022-12-19 16:48:54] <%caseymccabe13> Yo Nep
[2022-12-19 16:49:02] <urunclesulcer> Nep is real af compared to the other cornballs
[2022-12-19 16:49:04] <%$ItsTr3ple> Back then you scared the shit out of me LUL
[2022-12-19 16:49:04] <%+oliver21k> I loved the wage war series you did with other youtubers
[2022-12-19 16:49:05] <azeem454> damm you voice was different then
[2022-12-19 16:49:07] <itisthepastaman> Do you still have the old lambo?
[2022-12-19 16:49:10] <%$coys51> what was that voice are me jump lol
[2022-12-19 16:49:10] <%DmacPrototype> And a better mic
[2022-12-19 16:49:16] <zaraankhan200> so what nep
[2022-12-19 16:49:25] <Brawnaldo> are you telling me ive been watching the same thing for 10 years
[2022-12-19 16:49:28] <zaraankhan200> it good
[2022-12-19 16:49:31] <+Aidanrcam> ur views gone down cause the games dead not ur content
[2022-12-19 16:49:33] <%+Michael_Conroy> Still got a great hairline tho!!
[2022-12-19 16:49:35] <alfreddavidssonn> How do you do it different though?
[2022-12-19 16:49:36] <callec18> Consistency is good
[2022-12-19 16:49:39] <ceres_ii> thats the games fault
[2022-12-19 16:49:46] <$supahmarioo> Not your fault when EA has made 0 changes to draft
[2022-12-19 16:49:47] <shauninio> Do you know when Sorare rewards are being given out for the last matchday and the overall global cup reward?
[2022-12-19 16:49:48] <+TurtlesHeadsPopinOut> you never age wtf is that about
[2022-12-19 16:49:53] <%$TraFFi_csgo> "so what, you only lost 90% of your views" LMAO
[2022-12-19 16:49:54] <%+derrickp_13> its the same just draft isn't as fun as it used to be games fault for keeping it the same pretty much
[2022-12-19 16:49:54] <+Saify14> recycled?
[2022-12-19 16:49:54] <neil1989> @DavisPlayzz my icon pack is shite .always get shafted lol
[2022-12-19 16:49:55] <+shorich3> sometimes it may not even be you nep
[2022-12-19 16:49:58] <+jondontattiescone> nep, will you play the new EA game or FIFA game next year? It'll be interesting to see which way content creators go
[2022-12-19 16:50:00] <+Saify14> looking for fresh ideas
[2022-12-19 16:50:00] <mdkfifa11> Fifa content was popular back then, now it isn‚Äôt really popular
[2022-12-19 16:50:01] <Stallone986> because of EA
[2022-12-19 16:50:01] <arabiascenelh> its a diesease, get out while you can
[2022-12-19 16:50:04] <jpompeo40> This speaks more to EA‚Äôs laziness then your ability to make good content. I totally respect wanting to be creative and improve. That‚Äôs the goal of any professional
[2022-12-19 16:50:04] <%lilkumquatz> do u thinks it‚Äôs bc kids watched fifa back then and they don‚Äôt now
[2022-12-19 16:50:04] <ceres_ii> in fifa 16 everything was hyped and new
[2022-12-19 16:50:04] <+eman905> New game mode
[2022-12-19 16:50:04] <MeisterNes> because fifa was more hype back then?
[2022-12-19 16:50:05] <callec18> Games fault
[2022-12-19 16:50:06] <xRamiresx> nobody cares about fifa anymore
[2022-12-19 16:50:08] <%s_embo> because fifa youtube died
[2022-12-19 16:50:09] <azeem454> Its repetitive
[2022-12-19 16:50:10] <+Siiimply> because people are losing interest in fifa
[2022-12-19 16:50:10] <Stallone986> EA makes or breaks its content creators
[2022-12-19 16:50:13] <+sheriffshinetop> To be fair to you Nep, I imagine it's very difficult to evolve your content when EA refuse to evolve their game at all. They aren't giving you a lot to work with
[2022-12-19 16:50:13] <jhunter123> The games fault not yours
[2022-12-19 16:50:13] <+Siiimply> simple
[2022-12-19 16:50:13] <zaraankhan200> OK
[2022-12-19 16:50:14] <+Ben_iix> Games just dying out for that kind off stuff
[2022-12-19 16:50:15] <%johnfive21> It was fairly new game mode back then
[2022-12-19 16:50:16] <+mykill91> your on a different channel
[2022-12-19 16:50:16] <girldiator> There get old not playing gifa
[2022-12-19 16:50:16] <+eman905> Drafts were more popularly
[2022-12-19 16:50:21] <urunclesulcer> defo got a point
[2022-12-19 16:50:21] <andrew_maggipint0> it was new back then, draft hasn't changed in years
[2022-12-19 16:50:23] <Bonus_Exitus> it also seems like Fifa 23 is a pretty dead so there is not much to do than try to improve your video format and be prepared for what is hopefully a better game next year
[2022-12-19 16:50:25] <zaraankhan200> I get u
[2022-12-19 16:50:27] <%$istreet98> When people dont adapt they get left behind. Can't keep doing the same thing over and over and thinking it'll stay successful forever
[2022-12-19 16:50:31] <suliman534> It‚Äôs cause fifa died not u
[2022-12-19 16:50:32] <%+bigdan8888> markets more diluted with more content creators
[2022-12-19 16:50:34] <%+stackmillz> i think personally that alot less people are playing fifa and fut in general
[2022-12-19 16:50:35] <%s_embo> 200k is not 400k
[2022-12-19 16:50:39] <$justbeingjames_> I think the content creation scene is much more saturated these days too tbh - so  many different creators for people to discover so they might find someone else before you
[2022-12-19 16:50:40] <%+Arkuvio> If Alron Towers visitor numbers fell by 90% they would be changing things up and trying new things
[2022-12-19 16:50:43] <%$ItsTr3ple> Habr ish quality
[2022-12-19 16:50:45] <oggieboi> more people liked the older fifas also kids just watch tittoks
[2022-12-19 16:50:46] <+mykill91> your drafts were on your main account before
[2022-12-19 16:50:46] <jhunter123> It‚Äôs not your fault genuinely
[2022-12-19 16:50:52] <callec18> Change language
[2022-12-19 16:50:58] <callec18> You need to learn a new language apparently
[2022-12-19 16:50:58] <chimmychanga02> Is it because its in a new channel?
[2022-12-19 16:51:01] <+j_mc5709> Because the community you grew up with are now older so they don‚Äôt have time to watch. Whereas all the new people are going to the in your face content like Danny arrons imo.
[2022-12-19 16:51:04] <+WaynesWorld20_> Isn't it a bit different because of language as well?
[2022-12-19 16:51:04] <+shorich3> people and trends change like how the big pack opening was a thing
[2022-12-19 16:51:05] <andrew_maggipint0> maybe because it's not your main channel
[2022-12-19 16:51:07] <+drboggsmd> I think the podcast forum also is the appropriate place for constructive feedback to EA on improvement areas. Or another video channel dedicated to long-form discussions.
[2022-12-19 16:51:14] <%sorarejosh> dunno if u can compare english speaking to non-english speaking fifa creators, completely diff markets
[2022-12-19 16:51:15] <elportuguese> imo the solution is about gaining a part of the new audience joining the scene, those have different expectations for content. Old audience usually fade away slowly as we stop playing the game for whichever reason
[2022-12-19 16:51:16] <%BobbyTambling> this guy is a bit different imo because his target audience is different, its only to Polish speakers, where as you have a larger target audience to obtain, in english
[2022-12-19 16:51:18] <%+stackmillz> i think personally that alot less people are playing fifa and fut in general
[2022-12-19 16:51:18] <+sealdawg> Honestly Nep, there‚Äôs nothing new in the game to get excited about anymore.
[2022-12-19 16:51:21] <jpompeo40> Did you listen to the latest Omegle bars?
[2022-12-19 16:51:27] <Bret__> Just learn polish tbf
[2022-12-19 16:51:28] <%MagpieWarriorHD> at wat point do u finally say I made it nep u have been very successful is it just coz Ur ambitious and want to do more
[2022-12-19 16:51:28] <%s_embo> there is literally a common sense answer ... there are 1000000000000 english speaking youtubers
[2022-12-19 16:51:29] <maddannyboi> You need to start talking in different language to spread viewers evenly
[2022-12-19 16:51:32] <+Harwoodinho> Do a Mr Beast and upload the videos in multiple languages haha
[2022-12-19 16:51:32] <+shorich3> dont think its you man you're sick at what you do
[2022-12-19 16:51:32] <%sorarejosh> whats the highest viewing english speaking draft creators?
[2022-12-19 16:51:32] <alfreddavidssonn> How do you do DTG different though?
[2022-12-19 16:51:33] <+thecoffers> Did you have more followers then too?
[2022-12-19 16:51:37] <+ricks_yonko> There‚Äôs also a grand difference from 7 years to 2 weeks
[2022-12-19 16:51:37] <HIPPO_________> the English speaking market has become more condensed,
[2022-12-19 16:51:40] <jhunter123> The UK content creators are diluted as said earlier in the stream there is so many good content creators
[2022-12-19 16:51:44] <%BobbyTambling> i can give lessons in russian
[2022-12-19 16:51:45] <%$istreet98> Get a translator on and upload in polish
[2022-12-19 16:51:46] <xcrimeprimerox> A lot less Polish fifa content creators
[2022-12-19 16:51:53] <%DmacPrototype> Next draft Australian accent only
[2022-12-19 16:51:55] <%+roonest> there's a lot of competition in english speaking spaces
[2022-12-19 16:52:06] <+blazeshadowdark> You think the difference is that you stream now and people can. Watch it here? Just thinking
[2022-12-19 16:52:10] <Bret__> It's more creative than clickbait
[2022-12-19 16:52:10] <$justbeingjames_> @jhunter123 yeah and people generally stay with the creators they find/like first
[2022-12-19 16:52:11] <+Pughy30> This looks like zoomer content
[2022-12-19 16:52:13] <%+derrickp_13> time to speak a different language nep
[2022-12-19 16:52:21] <%johnfive21> it's a one off
[2022-12-19 16:52:23] <Bret__> It's certainly new
[2022-12-19 16:52:25] <%sorarejosh> this is the content most of us here probs dislike
[2022-12-19 16:52:42] <jhunter123> I remember on a Cani stream he said he wondered what would‚Äôve happened if he uploaded in Turkish/ German
[2022-12-19 16:52:46] <%AHumanAlien> You should dub one episode in spanish and see how it does
[2022-12-19 16:52:48] <+thecoffers> Polish subtitles?
[2022-12-19 16:52:48] <+jbfut_> 'I spent $1000 on draft' LUL
[2022-12-19 16:52:55] <franjosima> Draft is dead
[2022-12-19 16:52:59] <callec18> Just learn Arabic and polish
[2022-12-19 16:53:00] <%skeroboy10> imo the game mode is dead
[2022-12-19 16:53:02] <%$petejb1990> Clickbait seems to get hate but do you think it‚Äôs necessary when uploading a video to word titles in such a way to attract more viewers?
[2022-12-19 16:53:04] <+sheriffshinetop> To be fair to you Nep, I imagine it's very difficult to evolve your content when EA refuse to evolve their game at all. They aren't giving you guys a lot to work with.
[2022-12-19 16:53:06] <%DmacPrototype> I hate it personally, makes me feel sick
[2022-12-19 16:53:09] <@CaniSports> @jhunter123 if I went German id probably have twice the subs by now tbf
[2022-12-19 16:53:11] <%+DkBeest> It has also much to do with the value of your RTG. A few years ago, lots of people were learning so much from your series. With the way fifa is built these days, the RTG has almost no value because there is not much to explain to your viewers.
[2022-12-19 16:53:19] <%$istreet98> Do you need to do draft to glory? Based off your RTG theory you've reached the glory. So why continue DTG when you could be doing something else?
[2022-12-19 16:53:29] <%DmacPrototype> I watch videos to engage with the person creating it not to be made to feel sick
[2022-12-19 16:53:32] <%$ItsTr3ple> Maybe 121 attempt
[2022-12-19 16:53:36] <moistcoot3r> i know its not the same game but i think you should check out mmg's content he plays madden
[2022-12-19 16:53:40] <%AHumanAlien> @jhunter123 Have you thought about filming same episode twice once in german and English and upload on a German channel?
[2022-12-19 16:53:41] <maddannyboi> It‚Äôs the different language that gets them more views
[2022-12-19 16:53:41] <%sorarejosh> learning a new language the new youtube meta?!?
[2022-12-19 16:53:44] <%johnfive21> Just fun challenge drafts
[2022-12-19 16:53:48] <Umar345> tbh nep no offence but your Fifa content hasn't really evolved tho
[2022-12-19 16:53:49] <Stallone986> fingers crossed EA brings something fresh next game
[2022-12-19 16:53:51] <+blazeshadowdark> Di Maria is sick
[2022-12-19 16:53:52] <%johnfive21> Drafts with guests
[2022-12-19 16:53:55] <maddannyboi> Lovely squad nep
[2022-12-19 16:53:56] <+Rebzy__voxz> time to turn back the clock and go for 194 drafts !!
[2022-12-19 16:53:57] <a920123_> Oh yeah definitly CaniSports look at some of the Dutch fifa youtubers. They still rack up the views when they upload fifa content
[2022-12-19 16:53:57] <mah1920> he is trying to get highest rated

[2022-12-19 16:54:41] <%+rishray> i think most people watch draft to watch the squad building so challenges regarding that would do well i‚Äôd assume
[2022-12-19 16:54:47] <%skeroboy10> @sorarejosh agree. The fact that u can't change positions is so dumb
[2022-12-19 16:54:47] <%$ItsTr3ple> Thanks for the input lmao
[2022-12-19 16:54:50] <%+Brandez84> think only way draft can be improved is if you add one of Josh' Spreadsheet showing profit/loss episode by episode once items are sold proving profit can be made etc via a draft

[2022-12-19 16:56:23] <%Exothermicc> It'd be good to see some variations on the drafts, I don't see any other creators getting viewers involved for drafts... Maybe there's a reason for that I.E it's shit but different ideas on the same method
[2022-12-19 16:56:26] <%+derrickp_13> @umar345 bro the game is the same it is so difficult to create new content when ea don't change the game

[2022-12-19 16:56:48] <jhunter123> It‚Äôs also based off luck as well some luck comes into it I personally like others will watch whatever you put out on fifa

[2022-12-19 16:59:47] <%$hazzat1345> Your idea Of a 6 hour road to glory sounds good and also the idea of starting a new account Friday 6pm and seeing how much you could build your club and coins come monday
[2022-12-19 16:59:48] <fifasweat97> 30 games, 11 if packs, 45 reds monthly, gold cards being used in march. EA just went for the money

[2022-12-19 16:59:58] <%+rishray> i think people want to watch content that they can‚Äôt attain themself, eg 20 wins in champs or massive pack openings, whereas your content is geared towards helping people develop at the game without those

[2022-12-19 17:03:21] <%skeroboy10> Nep, i think one of the most interesting things could be playing fut champs with the promo team that came out on that friday. People always interested in new players to see if they are good or not
[2022-12-19 17:03:24] <jhunter123> I would also say next year could be great for you with the ‚Äúnew game‚Äù (EASFC)

[2022-12-19 17:03:47] <%DmacPrototype> I think in honesty no league SBC's has really hurt your channel as well. For the most part you were one of the most popular FIFA youtubers who's content was based around League SBCs, them not releasing them has caused a downward trajectory in your channel that I think will come back if we get league SBC's.
[2022-12-19 17:03:57] <iZuloft> Road to R9 even
[2022-12-19 17:03:59] <%AHumanAlien> @jhunter123 I'm not sure. It will be same game but with just a name change
[2022-12-19 17:04:04] <%+bigdan8888> do you think they will make a huge change next year
[2022-12-19 17:04:11] <ron_from_duluth> I think it's a flooded market for content. Everyone has a "tips and tricks" video that is recycled, a lot of pack openings, etc.
[2022-12-19 17:04:12] <fifasweat97> because rtgs were so much harder
[2022-12-19 17:04:17] <%The_Nines_> Don‚Äôt you think you‚Äôre doing that by default any way?

[2022-12-19 17:04:27] <%+athletico_pathetico> more moments content then?
[2022-12-19 17:04:28] <+sealdawg> The high point for FIFA I fear is gone forever. EA would have to redesign game to generate any rise in popularity. It‚Äôs like anything that is a trend. Always ends without change
[2022-12-19 17:04:31] <%$istreet98> Do you think there will be a huge change in EA FC 24? Has to be as i think losing the FIFA name will be so costly
[2022-12-19 17:04:33] <%unknownEsshole> Hey boysh
[2022-12-19 17:04:38] <+mikec134> try and find a different end goal rather than ‚Äúto glory‚Äù
[2022-12-19 17:04:38] <%+gourjamz> i used to watch your 6 pm videos to see what was new in the game, i know its bad but now its for your disappointment because i feel the same when it drops!
[2022-12-19 17:04:39] <%$petejb1990> Do you think it‚Äôs fair to say that because of fifa you became popular but also because of fifa you have lost views(due to there not being anything new and exciting released by ea for a long time)?
[2022-12-19 17:04:40] <%+nippy9> I work in user experience and experience design. user feedback should drive each decision. have you done anythibg like this? even a survey or question to audiences? it must happen a few times a stream people ask about ruin a randomer and in your opinion it's not going to work but people are asking for it so it must be worth a go
[2022-12-19 17:04:43] <%+derrickp_13> i am excited to see what happens with fifa in the future if a company like 2k or pes takes over
[2022-12-19 17:04:46] <%+motadace> have you played with this team yet?
[2022-12-19 17:04:48] <c1dotloose> If KSI or Speed decided to upload a draft they will get views because their just enjoying the game instead of worrying about how can I get the best viewership
[2022-12-19 17:04:57] <mattyg12> next year will be interesting if there is any changes. maybe age is a factor. I don't want to watch young kids doing stuff that they think is funny. they have almost diversified into entertainment.

[2022-12-19 17:05:02] <+Hapax_1094> you think its too late for the fortnite swtichover?
[2022-12-19 17:05:03] <%AHumanAlien> @jhunter123 I hope its a step change but based on the last 5-6 years. I think they will just copy paste and do what they do best. Market the hell out of it...we'll then be dissapointed.
[2022-12-19 17:05:13] <+tomarnold27> Do your views bump when theres an overpriced SBC cause i always tend to come for your reactions when i see that?
[2022-12-19 17:05:17] <%+mikekozy23> old zwe
[2022-12-19 17:05:20] <%+rishray> how about a series where you play other youtubers that do RTGs maybe every couple of weeks as a tournament? keeps you needing to upgrade your team and adds competition?
[2022-12-19 17:05:22] <%BobbyTambling> @c1dotloose i strongly disagree
[2022-12-19 17:05:26] <%+mikekozy23> old man zwe zweHype
[2022-12-19 17:05:30] <%+stackmillz> you thought about like making a video about how u started out only winning 6 games until sum dweeb wanted to b toxic so now it turned into 11 juss like winging content outa funny moments on stream
[2022-12-19 17:05:31] <craigo5864> Your best series ever was ruin a randomer . Would be awesome if that could be rebooted rejigged somehow . Your storytelling ability is next level üòäüòäü§™

[2022-12-19 17:05:37] <%The_Nines_> Waiting for new features seems like the default state of a lot of the creators so I‚Äôd continue to tease out new ways to package your content
[2022-12-19 17:05:44] <jhunter123> @ahumanalien we don‚Äôt know, if ea or fifa is holding the game back, time will tell I guess
[2022-12-19 17:05:44] <ceres_ii> the rtgs used to be soo much harder, unlike today
[2022-12-19 17:05:48] <%+riff_hunter44> No one makes vids for people who really love fifa but arent paticularily good at it outside of tactics and skills tutorials
[2022-12-19 17:05:48] <%+DaveTheBhoy> Barcaboy and Philpotto. Big Friday Livestream. What a time.
[2022-12-19 17:05:52] <%+Kieran96cfc> I still remember Wheeler and Maff
[2022-12-19 17:05:56] <+ConnorEvans11> antoholland and kill hollywood
[2022-12-19 17:05:59] <+M4N5F1ELD_> I think your audience have grown up with you too I think less people are watching fifa in general
[2022-12-19 17:06:00] <+sealdawg> The high point for FIFA I fear is gone forever. EA would have to redesign game to generate any rise in popularity. It‚Äôs like anything that is a trend. Always ends without change
[2022-12-19 17:06:01] <%FUTDAN26> It‚Äôs a bit like tv. Back in the day there was just bbc and itv so they had the viewership. Now there‚Äôs so many different channels the viewership is spread out more.
[2022-12-19 17:06:05] <%$istreet98> antoholland was goated
[2022-12-19 17:06:10] <freysi123> I have a conspiracy theory. they cut off League sbc to f..k with some of the content creators. specifically those who say and have said outloud: do not buy fifapoints!!
[2022-12-19 17:06:24] <$knosher1> i think alot of it is the stagment new modes in fifa, its the same game modes every year, if something new was introduced this year instead of the boring moments section.
[2022-12-19 17:06:25] <nikomoz> is there a point doing di maria if i have ribery?
[2022-12-19 17:06:33] <+MarshallGamingTTV> facts
[2022-12-19 17:06:33] <+ConnorEvans11> I loved kill hollywood
[2022-12-19 17:06:36] <+mikec134> maybe try and showcase how quick it is to accomplish certain things rather just ‚Äúroad to glory‚Äù
[2022-12-19 17:06:49] <%The_Nines_> Hit the YouTube honestly at least for editing tricks and tips
[2022-12-19 17:06:54] <damiianxv> You are Derek in editing
[2022-12-19 17:06:57] <%+jack_0207> employ ppl that can do that
[2022-12-19 17:07:00] <%$petejb1990> Due to that kind of a relationship I think that ea should be using content creators a lot more with the development of their game. To get a varied selection of content creators to make different aspects of the game would be great
[2022-12-19 17:07:21] <awnge> but why do you thimk ea will ever change theve been doing the same shit year after year, i dont think its wise to just sit around and wait on them do some new shit, youre correct, its up to you to spice things up somehow

[2022-12-19 17:09:24] <callec18> Serious question-do you not talk with other YouTubers about this stuff??
[2022-12-19 17:09:36] <+kyle2367> Hey mate you think we will get the 75 games ww pack in objectives ?
[2022-12-19 17:09:36] <+Jhaytch1> Will the be any new players released tonight

[2022-12-19 17:09:48] <callec18> Genuine question-don‚Äôt you talk to other YouTubers about these kind of stuff?
[2022-12-19 17:09:56] <%+Cavacom> i think this is the entire purpose of conventions
[2022-12-19 17:09:59] <azeem454> @Jhaytch1 There will be new swaps
[2022-12-19 17:10:02] <%$istreet98> Do you need to streamline that and be harsh and cut some?
[2022-12-19 17:10:11] <%+riff_hunter44> Cause this stuff is really interesting
[2022-12-19 17:10:12] <%sorarejosh> thats a youtube algorithm issue too , ideally you'd like everything on one channel

[2022-12-19 17:10:19] <%+rockmanl0l> Have you thought about contacting Konstantin (Kon) about helping improve your set up and bits as hed be super knowlegeable about all the tech side of things
[2022-12-19 17:10:33] <%+rishray> onlyfans content would be amazing tbh
[2022-12-19 17:10:38] <adamryan_10> So quality over quantity
[2022-12-19 17:11:00] <%+riff_hunter44> Why arent there any fifa community get togethers btw?
[2022-12-19 17:11:29] <+Siiimply> just do youtube boxing and get a bag, call out bateson
[2022-12-19 17:11:34] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> What I find interesting is the Draft channel is still growing fairly consistently subscriber wise
[2022-12-19 17:11:45] <%$istreet98> I enjoy watching your videos and watch them all but i know im the anomaly. but it seems like youre still stuck in the era where you have to upload 3-5 vids a day. Even the sidemen used to do this but they've evolved on and do 1 big video a week. They used to upload 5 gaming vids a day
[2022-12-19 17:11:51] <%+hellojoea> being a "streamer/youtuber" at the scale that you are is surely not a 1 man thing? you need a team. It's clear as day that you need a bigger team that provide you with tech support, marketing, socials etc. you're the talent, but maybe you need people around you to bring it all together. ?

[2022-12-19 17:13:02] <%$istreet98> the sidemen used to upload 3-5 vids a day each. They've evolved and now make better content that loads of content
[2022-12-19 17:13:10] <+mikec134> have you tried an rtg with a specific end goal so can people can see how long it takes to accomplish certain goals? i think that could do well

[2022-12-19 17:14:28] <Vann96> I suppose it‚Äôs small steps to lead to bigger things you should collaborate with other YouTubers to bring a younger generation to ur channel
[2022-12-19 17:14:37] <@CaniSports> I dont think you would. Plenty of young editors out there whod be willing to work for less than the established ones out there I reckon

[2022-12-19 17:16:21] <%+rishray> i think over christmas period with people on break and no world cup content will do well
[2022-12-19 17:16:21] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> I think thats ignoring the reality of the views in the entire community though
[2022-12-19 17:16:21] <+Zegohvic> Isn't 24 hours a short time frame to obtain 100s of thousands of views though?
[2022-12-19 17:16:21] <+sealdawg> MattHDGamer and Pieface numbers are really low
[2022-12-19 17:16:31] <mattyg12> people watch everything live now
[2022-12-19 17:16:33] <%+futbolistic97> That has to do with the leaks as well
[2022-12-19 17:16:34] <%+markcheesyy> do you think leaks make a difference too. we nearly always know what's coming
[2022-12-19 17:16:36] <jpompeo40> Didn‚Äôt YouTube change the way monetization works. Has that effected you at all?
[2022-12-19 17:16:37] <%+mattyjkellly> its because of tikitok ppl dont care about it beecause they can just look at tikitok
[2022-12-19 17:16:38] <kamil_shark> However, youtubers are still able to do this full time so.. I guess there are still earning a lot of money than "normal" job.
[2022-12-19 17:16:39] <%CfcDre02> Numbers are way down across the board tho
[2022-12-19 17:16:39] <earvillage> Don't know if this point has been raised already, but could alternate plattforms for FIFA content contribute to Youtube views to stagnate?
[2022-12-19 17:16:44] <%sorarejosh> think u gotta blame sheriff alot for that
[2022-12-19 17:16:48] <%unknownEsshole> I think it‚Äôs the game tbh no matter what you do

[2022-12-19 17:17:01] <%lilkumquatz> @kamil_shark all of them stream to help supplement it
[2022-12-19 17:17:02] <%unknownEsshole> Fifa just has a specific audience
[2022-12-19 17:17:05] <%+theoldmanrtg7619> Would the views relate to the state of the game also the bad content  and not actually you
[2022-12-19 17:17:06] <%$istreet98> Fingers crossed in 2 years you dont look back and think 50k views was a lot
[2022-12-19 17:17:12] <%+Brandez84> hate those leaks still, needs to be banished
[2022-12-19 17:17:13] <ceres_ii> the whole leaking is a problem
[2022-12-19 17:17:14] <%$ItsTr3ple> Only ONE of Andy's SBSD Advent Calendar has over 200K views, compare it to like 2 years ago
[2022-12-19 17:17:15] <+Matkinz> hey nep, do you think when streamers rage that draws more people in?
[2022-12-19 17:17:16] <mattyg12> for sure he is
[2022-12-19 17:17:23] <%+DkBeest> but thats on EA tho, the worse the content, the less views on content review
[2022-12-19 17:17:32] <Vann96> Why hasn‚Äôt EA stopped the leaks it‚Äôs ridiculous imo
[2022-12-19 17:17:35] <kamil_shark> @lilkumquatz Of course, but there are other platforms like Instagram, TikTok where they earn much much more.
[2022-12-19 17:17:38] <azeem454> Is it because down to the content we are getting from EA that is affecting your views
[2022-12-19 17:17:45] <%+riff_hunter44> Hes killing the reveal
[2022-12-19 17:17:48] <%unknownEsshole> Leaking has ever been good even with music it‚Äôs never been good for the artists and it‚Äôs clearly impacting peeps like you in terms of that
[2022-12-19 17:17:49] <%sorarejosh> thats why di maria vid doing well, wasnt leaked days in advance
[2022-12-19 17:17:52] <+jbfut_> I was about to add that, Sherriff tells everyone what is coming so no one needs to watch the videos to see it anymore, we can see your reaction to it here as soon as its leaked rather than a 7-8pm vid on 6pm content
[2022-12-19 17:17:54] <+t0m90_> how is di maria guys? just completed him
[2022-12-19 17:17:56] <%+mattyjkellly> fut sherrif ruined promos
[2022-12-19 17:17:58] <$liamfifa91> 100% the leakers have ruined it, used to be great tuning in not knowing what was coming
[2022-12-19 17:18:05] <gashgiving> @mattyjkellly forreal
[2022-12-19 17:18:06] <%unknownEsshole> @t0m90_ He‚Äôs sick
[2022-12-19 17:18:13] <%The_Nines_> Competing to be the first with latest news is going to be a tough battle
[2022-12-19 17:18:14] <m_silky> I really dislike leaks and I think it hurts EA and our genuine interaction with the game
[2022-12-19 17:18:24] <%$istreet98> How does sheriff get his info and how haven't they stopped it yet?
[2022-12-19 17:18:29] <%+lcd2098> why are people blaming the leakers rather than the ease of accessing the info in the first place? EA do nothing to combat it
[2022-12-19 17:18:33] <gashgiving> Was great at first but now knowing everything prior just makes it boring
[2022-12-19 17:18:35] <%unknownEsshole> Tbh I still use your videos as a way to see what‚Äôs new everyday
[2022-12-19 17:18:51] <%robo_cfc> @lcd2098 very true, stop the original source then u stop the problem
[2022-12-19 17:19:02] <%+riff_hunter44> Reaction videos on Fifa are no more because of Sheriff and that was really part of almost every video
[2022-12-19 17:19:12] <gashgiving> EA must like it for some reason
[2022-12-19 17:19:16] <ceres_ii> kills the new content hype
[2022-12-19 17:19:17] <%+mikekozy23> start doin leaks innit
[2022-12-19 17:19:20] <+sealdawg> It‚Äôs also like a tv or film series. If the game content stays pretty much the same, then it eventually dies
[2022-12-19 17:19:20] <mathierry10> Tbf alot of people check futbin for content nowdays whereas a few years ago i would watch content creators. I guess people just dont want to watch content anymore as much as we once did
[2022-12-19 17:19:21] <%+theoldmanrtg7619> Bet fut sherif is a delight if you go cinema and there‚Äôs spoilers for a sequel
[2022-12-19 17:19:24] <%sorarejosh> we already know the team 3 days beforehand
[2022-12-19 17:19:29] <iZuloft> Now we know the content before it comes, we come to hear your opinion instead of both, that will contribute to a  loss in viewership
[2022-12-19 17:19:33] <Vann96> 100%
[2022-12-19 17:19:38] <+pringle94> I actually enjoy this type of content on stream tbh, it shows the human side of the creator. TBH streams like this are kind of the reason I don't want much youtube content any more. I'd rather see the work/grind behind the video than the video it's self. maybe that is just because I'm getting older
[2022-12-19 17:19:41] <%tomw99_> That Di Maria dynamic image üòç
[2022-12-19 17:19:42] <Corey2053701> Facts
[2022-12-19 17:19:43] <azeem454> Did you have more views for Fifa 22 than you have for Ffia 23
[2022-12-19 17:19:45] <layton754> Agreed
[2022-12-19 17:19:48] <%$istreet98> How have EA not stopped Sheriff getting the leaks?
[2022-12-19 17:19:54] <%+whale_b1ologist> I come here to see your opinion on it
[2022-12-19 17:19:56] <%$ItsTr3ple> Only ONE of Andy's SBSD Advent Calendar has over 200K views, compare it to like 2 years ago, 600K on average
[2022-12-19 17:19:58] <urunclesulcer> this is a great stream man
[2022-12-19 17:20:01] <%$HipsterPatrick> EA's own content schedule is already really repetitive as well. Leaks or no leaks, we all know generally what comes out each day.
[2022-12-19 17:20:07] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> TOTY Fifa 22 is the exact moment views starting crashing
[2022-12-19 17:20:09] <+sealdawg> Do you think sheriff is connected to EA Nep? Strange that EA would not legally stop
[2022-12-19 17:20:12] <%sorarejosh> leaks started this time last yr right? bet you'll a trend in views going down from that point
[2022-12-19 17:20:14] <Stallone986> are you for or against leaks neppo?
[2022-12-19 17:20:19] <%$Phinch23> But the Sherrif isn‚Äôt always correct with some of this stuff. EA could destroy him by doing stuff opposite of what he posts. Not sure why EA doesn‚Äôt weed him out in a proper way!
[2022-12-19 17:20:20] <ceres_ii> SBSD used to be so popular
[2022-12-19 17:20:26] <+drboggsmd> Have you talked about/genuinely considered moving to PES or another title? @nepenthez
[2022-12-19 17:20:39] <ron_from_duluth> Unfortunately I feel like that's just part of the game. They're trying to get views just like you and other content creators.
[2022-12-19 17:20:41] <%$istreet98> Can you do an actual day views comparison from Sheriffs first leak?
[2022-12-19 17:20:44] <%robo_cfc> mad
[2022-12-19 17:20:45] <%unknownEsshole> I think fifa itself is to blame aswell,the amount of people that don‚Äôt associate with it anymore must be big
[2022-12-19 17:20:57] <%sorarejosh> but leaks won't have affected aj content, so shows there are more factors causing the lower views
[2022-12-19 17:20:58] <prx_fut> yo
[2022-12-19 17:20:58] <@%Viperlization> I'm editing Di Maria btw
[2022-12-19 17:20:58] <Flazhey> 88 Jairzinho or 91 Eusebio?
[2022-12-19 17:21:03] <lozzer360> Its bc the games dead this year
[2022-12-19 17:21:06] <%+roonest> Is it because they are collabs tho? Leveraging two fanbases
[2022-12-19 17:21:11] <%robo_cfc> more than halved
[2022-12-19 17:21:16] <prx_fut> oh keylor navas
[2022-12-19 17:21:17] <%$LilFishFart> content overload cant consume everything and kind of disinterested tbh
[2022-12-19 17:21:17] <%+whale_b1ologist> What we need is more than one decent football game
[2022-12-19 17:21:18] <%+athletico_pathetico> man that's sad
[2022-12-19 17:21:18] <%+mattyjkellly> fut sherrrif killed every promo since the leaks
[2022-12-19 17:21:20] <HIPPO_________> your 6pm videos were always first you wouldn't load into game you'd click neps YouTube link now you get the sheriff tweet in your notifications, it's first and instant
[2022-12-19 17:21:30] <+null_eins_zwei_eins> Big man Nep! Watching you while driving
[2022-12-19 17:21:30] <m_silky> How to the leakers get the information about what‚Äôs going to be released?
[2022-12-19 17:21:36] <PhusionTV> I listen to your streams while I play fifa. I don‚Äôt watch YouTube as much anymore.
[2022-12-19 17:21:37] <%+OhSxnch> I like that Di Maria thumbnail a lot!!
[2022-12-19 17:21:45] <%$istreet98> @NepentheZ Can you do an actual views comparison from Sheriffs first leaks to see if views drop?
[2022-12-19 17:21:52] <%unknownEsshole> @hippo_________ Mute his notifications?
[2022-12-19 17:21:57] <%$LilFishFart> brb going to go rewatch all of the nep yt vids
[2022-12-19 17:21:58] <@CaniSports> Also gotta say though your thumbs look exactly the same since like 5 years brother needs change and adjustment to how things work now
[2022-12-19 17:22:00] <aman4311> Leaks are the culprit
[2022-12-19 17:22:00] <%+mattyjkellly> tiktok aswell
[2022-12-19 17:22:01] <%robo_cfc> lack of changes from EA
[2022-12-19 17:22:07] <Heir_to_the_demon7> Nep I didnt watch you for 2 years bc i didnt play fifa 21 and 22, but I have watched every 6pm content video and twitch streams multiple times a week this year bc I have bought the game again and you are my number 1 guy for information, so I think the views depend a little on guys like me who come and go when they buy the game or when they dont
[2022-12-19 17:22:08] <%unknownEsshole> Or you speaking generally
[2022-12-19 17:22:15] <ceres_ii> lack of innovation from EA and leaks are key.

[2022-12-19 17:22:35] <+drboggsmd> Have you talked about/genuinely considered moving to PES or another title? @nepenthez
[2022-12-19 17:22:36] <HIPPO_________> @unknownesshole I don't follow him, I meant the community in general
[2022-12-19 17:22:41] <DGGWRLD> Do you have example of anyone who managed to reverse this declining trend?
[2022-12-19 17:22:43] <+ikester213> get a new face
[2022-12-19 17:22:50] <%AHumanAlien> Lots of impacts on views but always got evolve with concepts for content and presentation

[2022-12-19 17:22:58] <@CaniSports> Issue is there are like 50 creators with same style sadly sonit doesnt stand out at all

[2022-12-19 17:23:25] <caretakerrrrr> Really interesting topic considering this is the most popular FIFA in terms of active players
[2022-12-19 17:23:27] <%$LilFishFart> no one over 100k views
[2022-12-19 17:23:32] <+ikester213> get your breasts out nep

[2022-12-19 17:23:38] <+dinho187> Change song, pleaseee
[2022-12-19 17:23:40] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> Boobs absolutely dont work. Matt proved that a few weeks ago
[2022-12-19 17:23:40] <%+lcd2098> auzio has doubled the views on either of those videos and is a really basic thumbnail
[2022-12-19 17:23:42] <!%+abdelazizoun> yo neppo how are you mate, what is the subject rn?
[2022-12-19 17:23:45] <amy2240> @goonerdan20 remember wager wars
[2022-12-19 17:23:56] <urunclesulcer> the algo dont like change
[2022-12-19 17:24:00] <ron_from_duluth> I think its a double edged sword for me. I'm a regular, but casual player. I'm trying to make a whole Serie A team for <30k, but then I'll watch a YT video where no player in the squad is less than 50-100k
[2022-12-19 17:24:01] <ceres_ii> loads of creators, same content
[2022-12-19 17:24:01] <%+lcd2098> auzio had other 100k
[2022-12-19 17:24:03] <%+lcd2098> over *
[2022-12-19 17:24:03] <@CaniSports> Yeah before algorithm settles takes a bit
[2022-12-19 17:24:08] <%robo_cfc> auzio's thumbnails are clean
[2022-12-19 17:24:12] <%+mattyjkellly> tiktok also means less ppl use youtube
[2022-12-19 17:24:12] <%+xVENOMx313x> basically stuck in purgatory
[2022-12-19 17:24:14] <iKing92> What year was peak YT @nepenthez
[2022-12-19 17:24:14] <@CaniSports> I wonder how we are all surviving when it isnt fifa but easfc btw
[2022-12-19 17:24:14] <$liamfifa91> Not sure what it is that‚Äôs driven me away but I used to watch all Nicks vids, AA‚Äôs, Pie‚Äôs etc‚Ä¶ but just don‚Äôt bother with YouTube much now, I‚Äôd rather just watch the stream and catch the content there, then log on to fifa myself
[2022-12-19 17:24:14] <kamil_shark> Are you able to compare it in terms of money income?
[2022-12-19 17:24:15] <gomokyplaysgames> Tbh the thumbnail doesn‚Äôt impact if I watch your videos, I like to hear your input on the content or thoughts on whatever else is in the video
[2022-12-19 17:24:17] <Stallone986> if change is wanted. would a new channel not be the way to go?
[2022-12-19 17:24:33] <Umar345> try different games tho neppo
[2022-12-19 17:24:36] <%+stackmillz> you thought about like making a video about how u started out only winning 6 games until sum dweeb wanted to b toxic so now it turned into 11 juss like winging content outa funny moments on stream

[2022-12-19 17:24:42] <%$ItsTr3ple> I can't remember the last time I watched a vid for the thumb, but that's because I'm not a "new" viewer

[2022-12-19 17:24:56] <%+taylorallen133> This is the best dynamic of all time on Di Maria
[2022-12-19 17:25:01] <+sealdawg> Nep, as good as you and other streamers are, you can‚Äôt polish EA‚Äôs ‚Ä¶.. The novelty for FUT has ended
[2022-12-19 17:25:02] <%unknownEsshole> @itstr3ple So true
[2022-12-19 17:25:06] <iZuloft> With a completely new game coming next year things will change, could be good or bad tho ha
[2022-12-19 17:25:07] <shaggybv88> you did CR7 but not Messi?
[2022-12-19 17:25:22] <%johnfive21> I've never watched a video because of thumbnail @ItsTr3ple
[2022-12-19 17:25:23] <ron_from_duluth> You should lean into a niche with a new channel. Like talking about Dynamic Duo cards, free cards, "affordable" cards and teams, etc

[2022-12-19 17:25:28] <%+zoe9593> That‚Äôs the thing though, we can‚Äôt control the algorithm, may it be insta, YT or Facebook. The only thing we can control is the value of the content and how that‚Äôs then delivered (I.e editing of videos or how they‚Äôre made). We can only focus on what we can control

[2022-12-19 17:26:25] <%unknownEsshole> What can you do different with a game like fifa ,jus keep doing ur thing
[2022-12-19 17:26:30] <urunclesulcer> lol

[2022-12-19 17:26:32] <PhusionTV> Skillz is doing pretty well on tik tok  from what I‚Äôve seen
[2022-12-19 17:26:32] <%+mikekozy23> he means bot views
[2022-12-19 17:26:35] <%BobbyTambling> but this is word of the mouth can be so instrumental, because if you start to do completely diff videos, people will be like yo check out nepenthez, hes un recognsible
[2022-12-19 17:26:39] <mattyav91> think he means bot views

[2022-12-19 17:26:59] <%+xVENOMx313x> Have you thought of doing more collabs with other content creators? I know you have done things in the past just not sure if its worth a shot again

[2022-12-19 17:27:29] <%+goonerdan20> @mikekozy23 No?

[2022-12-19 17:27:56] <%caseymccabe13> But I am like you, I am part of the older part of the community so I have seen you guys for years and years and years now
[2022-12-19 17:27:56] <+sealdawg> What do content creators think about Sheriff and any li into EA
[2022-12-19 17:28:03] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> Clips is the most useful tool I think we have right now for finding what works. Cause just on title and thumb, you can guess what does well and what fails miserably
[2022-12-19 17:28:06] <+Siiimply> you can only switch it up for so long, eg stat reveals
[2022-12-19 17:28:14] <%+mikekozy23> zwe's raps = villain mode
[2022-12-19 17:28:15] <%+erpeka1993> hey nep
[2022-12-19 17:28:22] <lozzer360> I think how bad this game is is the main issue
[2022-12-19 17:28:30] <+ikester213> and then there's zwe, a total amazing enigma
[2022-12-19 17:28:31] <Stallone986> I used to watch multiple fifa youtubers but it got too much and all the same. I picked nepz and stuck with his content. Maybe the fifa viewers jsut got split
[2022-12-19 17:28:34] <hzvz> @mikekozy23 LUL
[2022-12-19 17:28:34] <lilraz98> One thing I love is the draftmass stuff, challenges make it super exciting
[2022-12-19 17:28:35] <%caseymccabe13> Yeah I get you, I wasnt hating. I just started doing tiktok with my Son, ideas are tough to come by I feel your pain
[2022-12-19 17:28:36] <iKing92> Make an alter ego YT channel neppo
[2022-12-19 17:28:42] <%+mikekozy23> i fookin love zwe zweHype
[2022-12-19 17:28:57] <%+mikekozy23> his rtg this year has taken a step up
[2022-12-19 17:28:59] <%unknownEsshole> @stallone986 True,it‚Äôs hard to differentiate with fifa
[2022-12-19 17:29:02] <$MrMcMikey> doesnt miss a beat zwe dont
[2022-12-19 17:29:07] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> Although, speaking of clips, newest clip is slaying
[2022-12-19 17:29:16] <urunclesulcer> this editing is sick
[2022-12-19 17:29:20] <%+mikekozy23> his editor is doing great
[2022-12-19 17:29:21] <%$Phinch23> It‚Äôs a numbers manipulation and I don‚Äôt trust the platforms‚Ä¶your FB venture is proof that a great creator is controlled by the platforms. They lie and we can see the lies in the numbers declines over the years.
[2022-12-19 17:29:28] <ceres_ii> zwe edits are key
[2022-12-19 17:29:33] <Stallone986> his editing is goated
[2022-12-19 17:29:35] <%+mikekozy23> zweHype
[2022-12-19 17:29:38] <%BobbyTambling> lmao its actually pretty good
[2022-12-19 17:29:40] <Heir_to_the_demon7> zwe is the goat
[2022-12-19 17:29:41] <%robo_cfc> does he edit his own vids?
[2022-12-19 17:29:50] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> You would never get away with that
[2022-12-19 17:29:54] <romojv42> @robo_cfc yes
[2022-12-19 17:29:56] <%+DkBeest> thats sick tbh
[2022-12-19 17:29:57] <%+theoldmanrtg7619> It should
[2022-12-19 17:29:57] <%caseymccabe13> You are right though, if Nep done this everyone would say oh my god cringe Nep this isnt you
[2022-12-19 17:29:57] <+ikester213> proper crackhead energy you love it
[2022-12-19 17:29:58] <%+mattyjkellly> you should start a nepenthez reacys
[2022-12-19 17:29:58] <%+mikekozy23> i don't know, it should have billions
[2022-12-19 17:29:58] <%+xVENOMx313x> What about a rivals style tournament with you and other content creators. Using fifa draft style or something like that?
[2022-12-19 17:29:59] <+Saify14> Zwe is a goat
[2022-12-19 17:30:00] <PropheC_Live> Zwe deserves a lot more attention towards his channel 36k is shocking
[2022-12-19 17:30:00] <dylanm1888> Fax
[2022-12-19 17:30:04] <+Saify14> so creative
[2022-12-19 17:30:05] <%+zoe9593> 100%
[2022-12-19 17:30:05] <azeem454> Its a pretty go intro ngl
[2022-12-19 17:30:08] <%+mikekozy23> should have billions of views imo
[2022-12-19 17:30:08] <urunclesulcer> ive never even heard of this guy
[2022-12-19 17:30:09] <PhusionTV> It should
[2022-12-19 17:30:12] <franjosima> Zwe is entertaining
[2022-12-19 17:30:12] <m_silky> Zwe is so creative
[2022-12-19 17:30:13] <dylanm1888> Zwe the shagger
[2022-12-19 17:30:14] <DGGWRLD> because after the fun intro, its the same video as 5y ago
[2022-12-19 17:30:14] <azeem454> good*
[2022-12-19 17:30:18] <romojv42> @urunclesulcer hes so funny
[2022-12-19 17:30:18] <lilraz98> It‚Äôs a long intro
[2022-12-19 17:30:18] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> That title is shit as well though
[2022-12-19 17:30:28] <lilraz98> Mr beast is 10 second intro
[2022-12-19 17:30:32] <+sealdawg> Because the rest of his content is so strange. He starts well, but doesn‚Äôt follow through
[2022-12-19 17:30:32] <%$deathskamikaze> Zwe is a different breed though. Marmite. Love or hate. I think he‚Äôs brilliant
[2022-12-19 17:30:38] <+jbfut_> I agree, I like Zwe as a person, but if im wanting to watch fifa, i want to improve or learn something and im not sure i'd get that from watching this video
[2022-12-19 17:30:39] <jhunter123> I don‚Äôt watch Zwe anymore but he creates great content
[2022-12-19 17:30:42] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> Thumb is bad too
[2022-12-19 17:30:43] <%+xVENOMx313x> What about a rivals style tournament with you and other content creators. Using fifa draft style or something like that?
[2022-12-19 17:30:47] <%+2siick87> theres alot of fifa streamers now though
[2022-12-19 17:30:47] <+akimb0o4> This is very true I do this all the time tbh
[2022-12-19 17:30:52] <%+athletico_pathetico> routine comes into it a lot as well, people just find themselves going to the same place out of habit
[2022-12-19 17:30:53] <%+Cavacom> I actually think Fifa content has fewer viewers. Reduced community numbers as a whole.
[2022-12-19 17:30:53] <+SimpleSimonSays> I've never watched him, but after that few seconds I actually want to watch that vid...would't have done just by the title
[2022-12-19 17:31:00] <linus_teo> @SpreadsheetFifa how would you do it?
[2022-12-19 17:31:01] <%$Phinch23> You‚Äôre not fighting the fans, you‚Äôre fighting the Executives controlling the narratives
[2022-12-19 17:31:05] <thewalsallswift> He‚Äôs absolutely hilarious, love Zwe
[2022-12-19 17:31:07] <%+mikekozy23> see i watch zwe bc i don't care about the fifa, he's hilarious
[2022-12-19 17:31:13] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> Check Auzio's video
[2022-12-19 17:31:18] <%+mattyjkellly> nep start a reacts channel
[2022-12-19 17:31:28] <%+mikekozy23> i watch nep for meta fifa type stuff, watch zwe for vibes
[2022-12-19 17:31:28] <%+sknvbj> crazy how theres a science to youtube
[2022-12-19 17:31:28] <%robo_cfc> make the thumbnails cleaner and more simple
[2022-12-19 17:31:31] <%robo_cfc> so clean
[2022-12-19 17:31:37] <j4ckt__01> Hi mate hope your well, opinions on the game yesterday
[2022-12-19 17:31:42] <Stallone986> classic tier list ahaha
[2022-12-19 17:31:43] <%unknownEsshole> Noahsnoah gets lots of views on his fifa content but his is mostly memes and edits
[2022-12-19 17:31:43] <urunclesulcer> smashing thumb that
[2022-12-19 17:31:52] <%unknownEsshole> And he hardly posts fifa
[2022-12-19 17:31:58] <+ikester213> like Marshals too
[2022-12-19 17:32:01] <ron_from_duluth> I think comparing players would be cool. Like, you find a certain position and then you pick Player A and see if he plays better than Player B in-game.
[2022-12-19 17:32:09] <%+zoe9593> Zwe just caters to a specific audience tho doesn‚Äôt he? He‚Äôs just vibes and banter. Whereas you and nick28t give tips, educate us and develop our knowledge on fifa etc. It‚Äôs an educational type of content whereas zwe is an entertain type of content
[2022-12-19 17:32:11] <+SonOfRachel> Zwe is the personification of what fifa should be: fun. The reality is a lot of people watch fifa for the grind, to learn, tutorials etc and as the years go on more and more people don‚Äôt play for fun
[2022-12-19 17:32:15] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> Wait, did AA do the same video back to back?
[2022-12-19 17:32:31] <%sorarejosh> why does his icon packs has so many more views compared to yours, what you doing differently?
[2022-12-19 17:32:31] <+Pughy30> Player reviews are basically a mad race to see who reviews him and gets the video up first
[2022-12-19 17:32:32] <ceres_ii> timing is so imporant
[2022-12-19 17:32:36] <%JakeNineFive> I think youtubers should use real life images of players for thumbnails
[2022-12-19 17:32:43] <%caseymccabe13> I like Vipez reviews but you can tell he is a pro player not a content creator if that makes sense
[2022-12-19 17:33:24] <jhunter123> It‚Äôs definitely a first come first serve pull on reviews I agree
[2022-12-19 17:33:24] <zubster1990> Feel like every video is competing with dannyarrons daily fifa watchers love his content
[2022-12-19 17:33:24] <%+DkBeest> But thats the point, nobody watches FIFA youtube anymore to learn something from the content creator in terms of the RTG, they just wanna consume packs and packs and player picks and more packs
[2022-12-19 17:33:24] <+drboggsmd> Couldn‚Äôt agree more @sonofrachel
[2022-12-19 17:33:25] <+grem1983> Views as a whole will be down from the last 2 years as people aren‚Äôt trapped at home in lockdown with nothing to do, and how new creators popped up during lockdown, so market is now flooded
[2022-12-19 17:33:26] <%AHumanAlien> His thumbnails feel different to others
[2022-12-19 17:33:26] <mathierry10> Rtg‚Äôs are definitely in their last stages. My 12 year old son enjoys fut but their pull to watch content on youtube is using and building squads on fut not rtgs. So the newer audience want to see dramatic videos that are funny and spontaneous. Castro is much appealing to the younger audience.
[2022-12-19 17:33:32] <+clutchball> its like how nick runthefut gets so many views for similar content to others
[2022-12-19 17:33:32] <%+zoe9593> Yup
[2022-12-19 17:33:42] <BODlll> I think the YouTuber shouldn‚Äôt be in the thumb just the thing the vid is about
[2022-12-19 17:33:42] <Alkharin> young lads seems a bit distant from your nep if you know what i mean, age wise. no offense :) @NepentheZ
[2022-12-19 17:33:53] <+SonOfRachel> @drboggsmd cheers fella, it‚Äôs a sad state atm
[2022-12-19 17:33:53] <kylewba165> do hope you are well nep
[2022-12-19 17:33:55] <ceres_ii> appeal to younger generation?
[2022-12-19 17:33:58] <%$Phinch23> So many Cookie Jars‚Ä¶hard to compare across all these platforms and profits. I‚Äôd rather see you live than watch repeat on YouTube and such‚Ä¶but I‚Äôm an older demographic so my opinion is void.
[2022-12-19 17:34:02] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> Auzio doesnt market him in his thumbs. Thats the main thing I take away
[2022-12-19 17:34:33] <%AHumanAlien> @SpreadsheetFifa His thumbs do feel slightly different to the others Nep was looking at before for the Icon packs.
[2022-12-19 17:34:33] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> IT was right on the cusp of FIFA 23
[2022-12-19 17:34:46] <lilraz98> I use to always see your shorts on my TL and now I don‚Äôt even get it recommended
[2022-12-19 17:34:52] <%$Phinch23> It‚Äôs a shift in content consumption
[2022-12-19 17:34:58] <+SonOfRachel> Do you think this iteration of fifa with have the game cycle longevity of last year? Because drop off seems mad early already this year (maybe World Cup mode has facilitated this)
[2022-12-19 17:34:58] <PropheC_Live> momentum
[2022-12-19 17:34:59] <ceres_ii> thumbs are very warm
[2022-12-19 17:35:02] <%robo_cfc> momentum is big by the looks of it
[2022-12-19 17:35:12] <%+mattyjkellly> whats the obsession with views all of a sudden surely just make content u enjoy
[2022-12-19 17:35:13] <+alps1122> all I know is, I cant stand stat reveal and roulettes... i skip the video  on tiktok when their video is doing that
[2022-12-19 17:35:13] <+EDGamesss> momentum
[2022-12-19 17:35:14] <%jordan97jw> those thumbs are so cursed
[2022-12-19 17:35:14] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> No facecam is massive imo
[2022-12-19 17:35:17] <+ikester213> any idea when the prime pack is meant to be ? I heard today maybe
[2022-12-19 17:35:23] <%johnfive21> @SpreadsheetFifa I geniunely think people are tired of youtubers in thumbnails
[2022-12-19 17:35:25] <%AHumanAlien> @SpreadsheetFifa Might be something worth trying
[2022-12-19 17:35:35] <+speedsterbr_> I do prefer the thumbs that don't have the creator pulling faces
[2022-12-19 17:35:51] <%+roonest> Are clips a gateway to good views on longer vids? During that period where your clips popped did your longer vids do well?
[2022-12-19 17:35:52] <%+riff_hunter44> I look out for his tier list vids
[2022-12-19 17:35:54] <%AHumanAlien> @speedsterbr_ I think its been overdone now
[2022-12-19 17:36:11] <ron_from_duluth> Nep, what kind of videos do YOU like to make?
[2022-12-19 17:36:15] <%AHumanAlien> Everyone is just copying Mr Beast. He's a youtube genius but is it right for you?
[2022-12-19 17:36:20] <%johnfive21> I think it's outdates/overdone .. same shocked faces is very cringeworthy now
[2022-12-19 17:36:29] <%+jack_0207> noahs Noah 2 is just totally different to most
[2022-12-19 17:36:31] <+ikester213> MR beasts face makes me uncomfortable
[2022-12-19 17:36:36] <%mbesh> that intro soothes my soul tbh
[2022-12-19 17:36:38] <MatthiasLFC> Love the review, keep them coming!! @NepentheZ
[2022-12-19 17:36:44] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> We have to shag off that intro.
[2022-12-19 17:36:53] <%$Phinch23> So people try to find and follow the formula‚Ä¶but the formula changes daily so you‚Äôre chasing your tail!
[2022-12-19 17:36:53] <+ryanking9999> EthosLab is my fav yoiutuber to track viewers, his retention is insane

[2022-12-19 17:36:56] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> And plop it in 20 seconds in after youve hooked
[2022-12-19 17:36:59] <finjcollins> TikTok has changed all of this

[2022-12-19 17:37:43] <+SonOfRachel> It‚Äôs like what the MCU has done to cinema. All fart, no poo. If everything is insane then nothing is
[2022-12-19 17:37:43] <%+roonest> Trailer whats happening in the vid is big too, letting them know whats coming

[2022-12-19 17:38:43] <+devx97> what about like a mini trailer before the video starts ?
[2022-12-19 17:39:18] <brendanbmo123> what chem style to use for di maria at cam and on the wing
[2022-12-19 17:39:18] <%johnfive21> Yea it had a stigma back then
[2022-12-19 17:39:18] <%+thegoslow> get a proper just down the coal mines!
[2022-12-19 17:39:18] <%+davidanderson20> I loved your fifa 17 the most and thats only due to the game and the content you can only work with what content you get
[2022-12-19 17:39:18] <%+thegoslow> *job
[2022-12-19 17:39:19] <%$ItsTr3ple> People made fun of KSI & Simon back in school for what they did, look at them now LUL
[2022-12-19 17:39:20] <%+mattyjkellly> why tho
[2022-12-19 17:39:20] <%nykchazzaa> the best intro is no intro
[2022-12-19 17:39:23] <+dkbos> look up greenie tease... standard technique to retain audience through ad break....might be helpful here as that hook you talk about at start of video
[2022-12-19 17:39:30] <%johnfive21> just clone yourself duh
[2022-12-19 17:39:33] <+ikester213> Guess it's time for onlyfans then Nep
[2022-12-19 17:39:34] <jameslfc7> Remember the days of you living by the train haha
[2022-12-19 17:39:34] <%+mattyjkellly> no as in why do u want more views
[2022-12-19 17:39:41] <brendanbmo123> is it good to play di maria at cam
[2022-12-19 17:39:43] <%+xVENOMx313x> What things hook you as a viewer to other peoples content?
[2022-12-19 17:39:45] <%+originalmorris8> I think you need more of your humour in the content, your tiktok about celebrations was hilarious, was sent it so many times
[2022-12-19 17:39:45] <+dinho187> Videos about 6pm content  is not necesseray i think, people want, giveaways, fifa points, player reviews, not slap a Maestro on him and thats, just my 2 cents
[2022-12-19 17:39:49] <%robo_cfc> ?
[2022-12-19 17:39:49] <%$LilFishFart> huh
[2022-12-19 17:39:50] <scott199183> world cup Donovan or world cup nakata ?
[2022-12-19 17:39:51] <simplefifayt> can't please everyone, we all prefer different types of videos..

[2022-12-19 17:40:04] <%$ItsTr3ple> Don't you want 12 views per month instead ?
[2022-12-19 17:40:06] <%nelsonscolumn77> Tease us in gently then go hard on us
[2022-12-19 17:40:07] <%$istreet98> MrBeast has talked quite a few times about what's important in a vid to gain viewers, could be worth a listen as would change the structure to your vids
[2022-12-19 17:40:12] <%$LilFishFart> neppoRedcard neppoRedcard
[2022-12-19 17:40:17] <+ismilann> Nep I work as a content creative. The thing that i noticed is indeed the long intro's. We did some research and it shows that you need to start the video with the peak of the content. Viewer retention (i think its called) is to short. The new way should be climax first.
[2022-12-19 17:40:19] <+dkbos> I can dm a link to a mod if helpful
[2022-12-19 17:40:20] <simplefifayt> @nelsonscolumn77 LUL
[2022-12-19 17:40:21] <kierondrake> yeah Nep, why would you possibly want to do EVEN better at your job...
[2022-12-19 17:40:23] <%+riff_hunter44> lol
[2022-12-19 17:40:24] <%$Phinch23> What happened to making content you enjoyed? At this point you‚Äôre chasing numbers and guessing against a constantly changing algorithm that only profits the big boy Executives!
[2022-12-19 17:40:27] <Umar345> maybe condense the no of channels you have is the sorare channel necessary ??
[2022-12-19 17:40:33] <linus_teo> i'll be honest, when I look in my sub box and want to watch a video apart from dtg the rtg and 6pm are at the bottom of the list of priority
[2022-12-19 17:40:35] <+rhyscfc> Think the fact fifa is so dead right now is obviously not helping the situation of getting views etc
[2022-12-19 17:40:45] <%+davidanderson20> Just realised you have a draft youtube channel thats class i love the draft content
[2022-12-19 17:40:47] <+britishcrumpet0> is there any creator getting 500k+ on fifa 23 content right now????
[2022-12-19 17:40:48] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> @Phinch23 huh?
[2022-12-19 17:40:55] <%JakeNineFive> Nep it's difficult to make different content on a game which hasn't changed much in the last 3-4 years. It's the same cards same sbc's every year
[2022-12-19 17:41:02] <ron_from_duluth> Is anyone crushing it with FIFA 23 content or is it down for everyone?
[2022-12-19 17:41:07] <Alkharin> you are the most informative and most knowlegable person regarding fifa so make more videos like your derek video and be the ''og'' of the community, you have the thickest voice as being the oldest big fifa youtuber so embrace it @NepentheZ
[2022-12-19 17:41:20] <+ikester213> its a conspiracy maaaaaan
[2022-12-19 17:41:23] <simplefifayt> he's a sub too..
[2022-12-19 17:41:23] <dean71888> I swear milestone and season progress 100k packs are so rigged, I only seem to get the minimum rating of 84‚Äôs
[2022-12-19 17:41:28] <%+mikekozy23> he probably wants elon to buy it
[2022-12-19 17:41:29] <%johnfive21> it's the lizard people
[2022-12-19 17:41:29] <km411996> I really like you‚Äôre videos and you‚Äôre streams I have no problem with them nep üëçüèª
[2022-12-19 17:41:30] <+ikester213> the lizards are running YouTube
[2022-12-19 17:41:37] <%+xVENOMx313x> What about a rivals style tournament with you and other content creators. Using fifa draft tournament or something like that?
[2022-12-19 17:41:41] <+FUT_Wizna> Its hard t provide a 6pm content video when lots of people are tuned in to the live streams with Nate etc and they see it as its revealed
[2022-12-19 17:41:53] <j4ckt__01> Would you ever consider playing pro clubs and starting a series?
[2022-12-19 17:42:01] <j4ckt__01> With ur mates
[2022-12-19 17:42:01] <+ikester213> I knew the reason I keep getting suggested hot tub streamers was because of lizards
[2022-12-19 17:42:12] <ron_from_duluth> lol everyone get your tin foil hats ready. Time for the lizard people and illuminati conspiracy
[2022-12-19 17:42:17] <%+thegoslow> people just watch it live now
[2022-12-19 17:42:18] <%$Phinch23> Apologize as that isn‚Äôt my intent‚Ä¶just trying to find different angles as I love your content!
[2022-12-19 17:42:19] <2M00N> eh?
[2022-12-19 17:42:25] <%+mikekozy23> is bro ok
[2022-12-19 17:42:26] <simplefifayt> yeah fairs but a bit questionable
[2022-12-19 17:42:27] <+EDGamesss> the executives couldnt care less what does well in fifa youtube
[2022-12-19 17:42:29] <KapzeMcLovin> Just completed Di Maria, different breed that card!! Such a beast
[2022-12-19 17:42:29] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> I honestly think the 6pm content is slaying when you look at the community and consider the time it takes to make those videos.
[2022-12-19 17:42:29] <%+davidanderson20> Biggest problem is there are so many leaks as well so people arent as invested in the 6pm content
[2022-12-19 17:42:30] <%+lcd2098> x files music hits
[2022-12-19 17:42:33] <%jordan97jw> tin foil hats at the ready
[2022-12-19 17:42:37] <+ikester213> I think YouTube is sleeping with my wife
[2022-12-19 17:42:38] <finjcollins> Definitely doesn‚Äôt believe in covid
[2022-12-19 17:42:43] <%$coys51> tinfoiled hat guy lol

[2022-12-19 17:42:45] <Byrne1704> Honest opinion, gaming is more a streaming content now, i watch a lot of streams but zero gaming vids on youtube. Maybe i am just getting old though @nepenthez
[2022-12-19 17:42:47] <Alkharin> you are the most informative and most knowlegable person regarding fifa so make more videos like your derek video and be the ''og'' of the community, you have the thickest voice as being the oldest big fifa youtuber so embrace it @NepentheZ
[2022-12-19 17:42:48] <%+pierce_23> i love the 6pm content
[2022-12-19 17:42:48] <rebona5> i have been watching religiously since 2019 and i dont plan to stop any time soon
[2022-12-19 17:42:54] <linus_teo> like with limited time I'm unlikely to choose a rtg video over other videos
[2022-12-19 17:42:54] <%$Phinch23> Views cut in half in short spans of time
[2022-12-19 17:43:01] <urunclesulcer> i love all the content
[2022-12-19 17:43:03] <%+xVENOMx313x> Have you tried wearing a tin foil hat while uploading ive heard that helps lol
[2022-12-19 17:43:03] <%+pierce_23> even when theres nothing you make it entertaining which is important
[2022-12-19 17:43:09] <%+davidanderson20> What was your favourite ever promo nep? Mines is fifa17 futmas.
[2022-12-19 17:43:09] <simplefifayt> remember a few years ago you said streaming is the future for you
[2022-12-19 17:43:12] <xjmb1996> Hey nep, you like Lisandro as a cb?
[2022-12-19 17:43:18] <ron_from_duluth> Maybe that's what your new content should be. Pivot into different conspiracy theories with FIFA like scripting
[2022-12-19 17:43:19] <simplefifayt> now its the main thing
[2022-12-19 17:43:22] <%+2siick87> i feel all the leaks are messing up people like your self because everyone already knows whats coming
[2022-12-19 17:43:31] <%+thegoslow> @phinch23 you do realise the market is saturated more than ever.
[2022-12-19 17:43:34] <+ismilann> Cant you just up the volume of videos? Just add up all the smaller viewer numbers
[2022-12-19 17:43:37] <%+pierce_23> personally never been fussed about drafts, RTG has changed so much especially within the past couple years and now theres no League SBC
[2022-12-19 17:43:39] <EminentScalar> As a very small YouTuber, learning about the numbers and algorithm etc is so interesting. Learning a lot from your stream today nep
[2022-12-19 17:43:46] <+GingerNinjaD> Guys, got 90 Henry in Icon SBC, shall i use him or Morientes
[2022-12-19 17:43:55] <%+Dubz_Vigil> everyone wants to be the best dont be hard on yourself
[2022-12-19 17:44:03] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> We're getting like 800-900k on the main channel every week. I reckon if you did one video a week that got 800-900k you would be delighted. I think thats something to muse over
[2022-12-19 17:44:08] <simplefifayt> league sbcs would be a game changer
[2022-12-19 17:44:09] <$liamfifa91> I think where there is such a saturation of content creators now there‚Äôs just too much choice.
[2022-12-19 17:44:17] <%+chemicallocust> Reckon League SBC's will ever come back?
[2022-12-19 17:44:18] <%jjaden10> Idk why but I have a weird feeling we get league sbcs today
[2022-12-19 17:44:18] <iKing92> Show a bit of leg in videos , spice things up KappaHD
[2022-12-19 17:44:21] <%+pierce_23> @SpreadsheetFifa MAD, like genuinely INSANE
[2022-12-19 17:44:26] <%+xVENOMx313x> No league sbcs have really been the death blow of this game
[2022-12-19 17:44:28] <+alps1122> fifa dying so early doesn't help I guess...

[2022-12-19 17:44:43] <$knosher1> i think your views will sky rocket again when EASFC is released
[2022-12-19 17:44:44] <linus_teo> Gameplay is such a big turn off for me, can't relate to it to stay engaged
[2022-12-19 17:44:48] <Mazeours> @NepentheZ I always had an idea that I believe would do well
[2022-12-19 17:44:48] <big_togger_> M's in my bank account.
[2022-12-19 17:44:52] <%+davidanderson20> So many people in terms of youtube are just watching icon pack openings etc its so sad the rtgs are dead man i miss watching the grind of making a team and being proud of a team
[2022-12-19 17:44:53] <kman3164> Do you think we won‚Äôt get League SBC‚Äôs this cycle of FIFA at all?
[2022-12-19 17:44:57] <Mazeours> And I think you can nail it

[2022-12-19 17:45:02] <ceres_ii> easfc needs major changes
[2022-12-19 17:45:04] <yobrejin> What about a new channel posting other games such as wz diablo and more
[2022-12-19 17:45:08] <%+pierce_23> have you thought about an RTG around a certain player like Danny Aarons does?
[2022-12-19 17:45:12] <%robo_cfc> yeah the games a huge barrier rn
[2022-12-19 17:45:13] <+Hapax_1094> is it too late to switch to fortnite for you?
[2022-12-19 17:45:15] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> Yeah about 7.5-8 mil across the 4 channels
[2022-12-19 17:45:20] <%johnfive21> I think waiting to TOTY is not unreasonable
[2022-12-19 17:45:22] <DGGWRLD> you ll start making $$ of shorts in Feb, that would be positive
[2022-12-19 17:45:25] <+FUT_Wizna> doesnt help when EA get rid of League SBCs which was a massive part of Fifa and our videos
[2022-12-19 17:46:16] <%+mattyjkellly> yes
[2022-12-19 17:46:18] <%KC_Runz> I often think your enjoyment of a personality on YT leads you to watch content on a regular regardless of what they put out. i've bee tuning in to your 6pm content stuff for nearly 5 years as part of my day schedule, bonkers right!
[2022-12-19 17:46:23] <%+davidanderson20> Come toty could see it massively inproving again
[2022-12-19 17:46:23] <iZuloft> Ride the wave, new game next year new content hopefully
[2022-12-19 17:46:28] <%JakeNineFive> I love FIFA but i have fun playing interesting games. FIFA no longer has that pull on me
[2022-12-19 17:46:28] <%lilkumquatz> i would ride it out until ea fc 24 and if it doesn‚Äôt change then i would go for a change
[2022-12-19 17:46:30] <%+2siick87> nep i wouldnt be concerned to much im new here and i sub to you and watch you everyday for how and who you are and your content
[2022-12-19 17:46:30] <simplefifayt> toty could be massive yeah
[2022-12-19 17:46:31] <Mazeours> The idea would be making regional online tournaments eith prizes
[2022-12-19 17:46:34] <+diddy_011> These are such good conversations to have at anytime, trying to improve yourself in anything is great
[2022-12-19 17:46:40] <MickeysIce> No grindable packs for Content
[2022-12-19 17:46:41] <Mazeours> which you make the rules
[2022-12-19 17:46:43] <jhunter123> I feel sometimes you don‚Äôt give yourself enough credit of course you could improve but you‚Äôve done so well and come so far
[2022-12-19 17:46:43] <%lilkumquatz> but still try a video every now and then to test the waters
[2022-12-19 17:46:43] <+ConnorEvans11> does toby still work for you nep?
[2022-12-19 17:46:44] <yobrejin> What about a new channel posting other games such as wz diablo and more
[2022-12-19 17:46:44] <%+mattyjkellly> just be you surely enjoyment over views
[2022-12-19 17:46:53] <%johnfive21> Nah if you want change it needs to be ready for EAFC
[2022-12-19 17:46:56] <+242charlie> u reckon they'll do futmas this year??
[2022-12-19 17:47:07] <simplefifayt> @242charlie nah only winter wildcards
[2022-12-19 17:47:22] <simplefifayt> i think they've buried futmas once and for all
[2022-12-19 17:47:22] <simplefifayt> sadly
[2022-12-19 17:47:45] <GanjRead> They can‚Äôt use the term Futmas that‚Äôs why
[2022-12-19 17:47:54] <GanjRead> Religious reasons
[2022-12-19 17:47:56] <+andymufc86> People trying to fix things that aren‚Äôt broken all the time imo to prove their doing something.
[2022-12-19 17:47:59] <%+warnerbruva> @kc_runz spot on!
[2022-12-19 17:48:00] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> One of the things we've been thinking about is a "Concept Week" where we make 5 different videos and release them one a day. I really think that could be fun
[2022-12-19 17:48:01] <simplefifayt> @GanjRead yeah but the promo is different too, they shoulda changed the name and kept it the same
[2022-12-19 17:48:26] <%KC_Runz> @warnerbruva Cheers man
[2022-12-19 17:48:30] <simplefifayt> @SpreadsheetFifa and then just see how each video performs?
[2022-12-19 17:48:30] <%+mattyjkellly> @GanjRead thats ridiculous
