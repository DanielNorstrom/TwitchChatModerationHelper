[2022-12-23 16:24:09] <+headrickslays> @RealD0naldDuck yea i think something like that could give people a more accurate place. some i feel have been grandfathered in or boosted for so long it just messing everything up

[2022-12-23 16:25:03] <+headrickslays> and i feel the RR system may need a little more work too. If you go 6-20, and are the reason why your team loses, you need to lose way more than 20. you need to lose 30

[2022-12-23 16:26:36] <+RealD0naldDuck> @headrickslays valorant is still a relatively new ish game, it has lost its peak hype but still fairly popular. but the problems of the game are becoming more noticeable. i am not suggesting mmr reset in the near future. but it could be necessary to bring ppl back when the game active player base drops further. :)

[2022-12-23 17:27:11] <gamerofcodyt> "Your aim is insane." Steel said, as he slipped his feminine hand into Hiko's pants and smirked.

The two kissed, deeply and passionately, and afterwards Hiko dropped his Sova arrow into Steel's open bombsite.

[2022-12-23 18:59:02] <ben3141592653589793238> @DeusVexus they wanted the game to be different for 2023
