[2022-12-07 13:05:04] <%Pielil> I absolutely despise ads they're so fucking annoying
[2022-12-07 13:05:09] <%m1NAYgg> Depends how long they are tbh
[2022-12-07 13:05:10] <%Frost_Apone> ads are fine but ads when you first load a stream to see if you like the content is crap
[2022-12-07 13:05:10] <%+Jaffapug> So OnlyFans is an option now? Cool, cool
[2022-12-07 13:05:10] <+dash_dingo_> ads are a barrier for new viewers more than the established viewer base
[2022-12-07 13:05:12] <$Nighseven> i dont mind ads, as long the streamer is not shoving 5 ads every 15-20minutes
[2022-12-07 13:05:13] <@%$Breakspear> Like what GraeEx said. If you're expecting to watch hours of content for free, then you're delusional

[2022-12-07 13:05:44] <$davefmv> i don't mind ads so much, but, i have definitely found twitch turbo to be a worthwhile investment
[2022-12-07 13:05:47] <%$GraeEx> I think we are a bit older also @Breakspear so that could be a factor - we have developed some patience
[2022-12-07 13:05:58] <%Jarvisio> Youtube is really agressive with adds
[2022-12-07 13:05:58] <%Kit_Isnt_Real> ads are a part of business whether we like it or not
[2022-12-07 13:06:00] <@%+GreggStrat> I thought you had YTP?

[2022-12-07 13:06:01] <HipHobbesT> Ads are everywhere now. It's not like "normal" Twitch is free of them.
[2022-12-07 13:06:06] <%+IamHondoLane> YT let’s u skip ads tho at least
[2022-12-07 13:06:07] <%MrMofo> WTFF It's snowing here, inTheBinge

[2022-12-07 13:06:27] <Tvee> I sometimes get 9 in a row
[2022-12-07 13:06:27] <%ribbelsche23> its always the same ad... thats not really entertaining also... i wish the ads all would have superbowl quality then i would love to watch them actually KEKW
[2022-12-07 13:06:34] <%+dootplays> Yeah I get why ppl don't like them I just know I have to pay for any other content so why not streaming
[2022-12-07 13:06:35] <@%$Breakspear> IamHondoLane Yeah, but when you're getting ads that you have to skip every 5-8 minutes, it still fucking shite.
[2022-12-07 13:06:39] <%Siph_14> Running servers with massive traffic costs money thou
[2022-12-07 13:06:41] <%sharpshifter> A reasonable amount of ads is fine - it's when you get 2 or 3 ads every 3 minutes on YT vids that I'm just like F this

[2022-12-07 13:06:59] <+Flug_1> i just block the ads
[2022-12-07 13:07:03] <%+MrMuffinsWorth> I mean they can be annoying but streamers need to be paid for their work
[2022-12-07 13:07:09] <%muggins210188> The ads that annoy me are when the creator makes an ad part of the video. You can’t skip them easily
[2022-12-07 13:07:09] <%+Jaffapug> Does skipping ads deprive the streamer of revenue on youtube? Or no difference
[2022-12-07 13:07:15] <%waveydave86> sick of seeing an advert for a shaver...I cant even grow a beard lol
[2022-12-07 13:07:19] <BriceyJB> "Granny i got the Job!" lol
[2022-12-07 13:07:20] <%Cartster> YT ads are inteligent... don't get blasted every stream you click... based on time
[2022-12-07 13:07:20] <@%$Breakspear> Jaffapug no difference I believe
[2022-12-07 13:07:24] <%Pielil> YouTube ads are the worst, it's either an unskippable 30 second advert or some shithead has made their music video an ad
[2022-12-07 13:07:31] <Makhai_Max> It's annoying getting ads in a stream when something major is happening or funny and you miss it
[2022-12-07 13:07:32] <%+dootplays> @waveydave86 the real issue, I feel you

[2022-12-07 16:14:44] <%PR3TENDr> Hello brkMleet
[2022-12-07 16:14:51] <%Kezzran> what constitutes a "view" on TikTok @BreaK ? Watching 2s, watching the whole thing, what?
[2022-12-07 16:14:53] <%Invisiblemag> diff medium
[2022-12-07 16:14:56] <%+ReallyZeroG> bots
[2022-12-07 16:15:01] <%DaNexxtOne> Very diff audience
[2022-12-07 16:15:05] <%+berdarien> Does he have a revenue stream off of TikTok though? Like a steady solid one?
[2022-12-07 16:15:10] <%kleier> people tiktoking on mobile and twitch is shit on mobile?
[2022-12-07 16:15:14] <@%sRede> like people who have autoplay on twitter, mental people
[2022-12-07 16:15:15] <%+drpepperenjoya> yeah its not real engagement / viewing
[2022-12-07 16:15:16] <%+aamef> And very different talent to draw people on a LIVE stream than to videos you can spend ages to develope.
[2022-12-07 16:15:23] <FuriousRexus> Wouldnt be surprised if TikTok just has extremely clever inflation algorithms running, to boost views artificially
[2022-12-07 16:15:30] <%+berdarien> Also TikTok vs stream is totally different. One is pure ADHD and the Twitch for me is something to watch while I'm working
[2022-12-07 16:15:32] <hitem13> tiktok is considered a security risk aswell, so is it really worth it?
[2022-12-07 16:15:32] <cheeseandbunionthe4th> tiktok probably has the opposite market share to twitch, most people on here hate tiktok and probalbly vis versa

[2022-12-07 16:15:44] <%+drpepperenjoya> 1% would be a good value to consider - companies like tiktok want you to think you have massive engagement and pay you nothing for it
[2022-12-07 16:15:46] <%Maxwell_IV> Tiktok is dumb, im using it for some voucher atm and when you try and exit it literally shoves you another clip and asks you to exit again
[2022-12-07 16:15:58] <%LkyJ21> most of those views are from other countries probably and wont watch the stream bc of language maybe?
[2022-12-07 16:16:14] <%thirty3baboons> Surprised nobody's ever made a "thing" of playing every stream with community members - I'm sure there are a lot of reasons, but games would come if they could play along.

[2022-12-07 17:25:02] <%brenny___> @rekoill online dating won't help with that mental state you have. it's tough judging someone off 6 pictures and a bio. my advice is take a break from it for awhile and focus on yourself as cheesy as that sounds
[2022-12-07 17:25:12] <%HonorNecris> @Kit_Isnt_Real Same situation, but was single for about 10 years, didn't really give a shit for most of them, was doing my own thing.

[2022-12-07 17:27:35] <%TwoKayVelocity> these dating apps feel like a losing game. I don't bother
[2022-12-07 17:27:44] <%Kit_Isnt_Real> @nubbykins congrats
[2022-12-07 17:27:45] <%EnderKilgannon> but Kelleh is a catch and look how cute your kiddo is. Real good relationships take time to develop. Just give yourself time and focus on you
[2022-12-07 17:27:50] <%HonorNecris> @nubbykins Best of luck to you!
[2022-12-07 17:27:54] <+ReKoill> Dating apps are like a menu for girls and the hardest BR for guys LuL

[2022-12-07 17:28:10] <%TwoKayVelocity> @ReKoill spitting facts haha
[2022-12-07 17:28:12] <%$Wiinnggg> the trouble with "internet dating" is it like looking through a catalogue, it is so easy to just keep turning the page! If you are not happy in yourself, and with yourself, how can you ever expect anyone else to be happy with you either. Work on yourself, get happy, get rich, then the women will come... might just be the rich part though that does it though ;) :) lmao Kappa
[2022-12-07 17:28:12] <%chubbsunicorn> this community is shit
[2022-12-07 17:28:14] <%brenny___> @rekoill not trying to counsel you man, just saying that a lot of dudes relate to you with dating currently
[2022-12-07 17:28:19] <%+nubbykins> @nubbykins much love
[2022-12-07 17:28:19] <%Beptogs> There is plenty of nice ladies out on dating apps.
[2022-12-07 17:28:28] <+ReKoill> @brenny___ Yeah I get it man, and I appreciate the advise, I really do
[2022-12-07 17:28:39] <%HonorNecris> @ReKoill That's pretty accurate lol.
[2022-12-07 17:28:42] <%kleier> "dating apps are like a menu for girls" a menu of garbage maybe
[2022-12-07 17:29:05] <+ReKoill> @kleier One person's garbage...
[2022-12-07 17:29:14] <%brenny___> @rekoill I'm not fat but I'm very short so I felt the same way regarding online dating and still feel the same way talking to people in person. but im comfortable with who I am you know?
[2022-12-07 17:29:33] <%FDeppy> im a pro at dating apps
[2022-12-07 17:29:36] <%TwoKayVelocity> seem like there's a stigma against being single. But much rather be single and happy
[2022-12-07 17:29:44] <%FDeppy> girls delete the app within an hour after talking to me
[2022-12-07 17:29:45] <+ReKoill> @brenny___ Yeah I get you, I'm not the tallest of guys either, its great when some profiles are like "6ft over only" lol

[2022-12-07 17:30:19] <%HonorNecris> @brenny___ Girls like that aren't worth it anyway imo
[2022-12-07 17:30:30] <%+Mr_Dorfmeister> My ex, pretty much led a double life where I thought she was travelling for work but she was with another Dude. I was lonely and depressed once I was divorsed, but decided to throw my so called "standards" out the window and joined Tinder... getting married next year to an amazing woman. You think you know what you want but its only when you find what you need that you will be happy
[2022-12-07 17:31:01] <%FDeppy> ReKoill might be an L. Theyd rather stay single than have to talk to me more brkYEP

[2022-12-07 17:32:16] <%Basuzu> people who played the beta swear that audio was perfect back then
[2022-12-07 17:32:38] <%+SmilerBull> i've been on apps and most are just advertising their instagram

[2022-12-07 17:33:22] <%+Mr_Dorfmeister> WHen I was young... (4 years ago)
[2022-12-07 17:33:32] <%Kit_Isnt_Real> and I met my gf on Bumble too
[2022-12-07 17:33:32] <@%sRede> Zuqar stopbeingMean
[2022-12-07 17:33:44] <%+nubbykins> break, met my GF and soon to be fiancee on Hinge, it still works. just have to be true to yourself and hope they are the same. i went on tons of good dates
[2022-12-07 17:33:49] <%+JediSnowman> I met my wife on ICQ
[2022-12-07 17:33:53] <%Blanken> My brother met his wife on tinder, so it happens still. just few and far between
[2022-12-07 17:33:53] <+Tails94> lets all just be gay - time to give up
[2022-12-07 17:33:53] <%$Wiinnggg> NEVER USE A FREE DATING SITE, use the paid places, is more serious for serious people. Use something that asks you so many questions and matches you with people that has similar things in common. How are you suppose to meet someone today that has similar likes/interests in the pub/club when all you have to start with is how they/you look?!
[2022-12-07 17:33:54] <%FDeppy> according to research, women swipe right about 5-10% of the men they see, while men do 50%
[2022-12-07 17:33:59] <+ReKoill> I have bumble set to literally all ages and 20 miles and I live in a city and its like "Nobody's here mate"
[2022-12-07 17:34:07] <+MrKatarsis> Its a minority who engage with each other, a lot of em are left in the sidelines. which shows onlione
[2022-12-07 17:34:20] <%+Skarym_> Did you have your twitch in your profile?
[2022-12-07 17:34:25] <%+GlasVelo> I met my Wife at school and we're still together :D
[2022-12-07 17:34:25] <%+nubbykins> i mean you are a cretin and i'm not so there is that
[2022-12-07 17:34:25] <%kleier> why not both BisexualPride
[2022-12-07 17:34:26] <%brenny___> Gayge
[2022-12-07 17:34:28] <%LkyJ21> inTheBinge
[2022-12-07 17:34:33] <@%$Breakspear> I've met my last 3 ladies online. It helps me because I'm a socially awkward ugly fucker, who can take a decent photo
[2022-12-07 17:34:34] <TheGreenFellow> Gayge
[2022-12-07 17:34:41] <%TwoKayVelocity> @kleier It's the opposite problem. Women have a catalogue of garbage. Men have trinkle of nothing. Just how these apps are designed to keep you using them
[2022-12-07 17:34:42] <Naxirian> I like to be friends with people first so I can see what they're *really* like lol
[2022-12-07 17:34:44] <%Beptogs> I also feel like there will always be more men looking because one guy can keep a lot of girls busy, while girls are usually happy with the attention of one (maybe two) guys
[2022-12-07 17:34:50] <%+Cupelix> I'm so happy, as a 41 year old dude, that I met my wife when we were 18, before dating apps :D
[2022-12-07 17:34:54] <@%$Breakspear> FDeppy come and join me and kleier for some relaxing pegging
[2022-12-07 17:34:55] <%brenny___> @breakspear tbf most dudes don't go out eith the intention of taking nice pictures
[2022-12-07 17:35:04] <%kleier> has it occurred to anyone that a lot of men on dating sites are actually terrible - not saying anyone here is terrible but overall
[2022-12-07 17:35:10] <+PMGrace> @Cupelix +1
[2022-12-07 17:35:10] <%Blanken> I never have any incentive to go out to a bar
[2022-12-07 17:35:12] <%+SmilerBull> i once had an american dude come onto me on the Met line in London. Asked if i played rugby and said "you're hot." Only time i've been hit on, shame i'm not gay.
[2022-12-07 17:35:21] <%+Zuqar> all my mates have 'settled' now feels like the only place to meet people is dating sites now KEKW
[2022-12-07 17:35:23] <+fozbert> tinder is horrendous, met one girl who was about ten stone heavier than her pictures , and met another girl who wanted me to choke her before we kissed 😂
[2022-12-07 17:35:27] <%brenny___> @kleier yup! I sat with my friend and she showed me some of the messages she gets and it's dumb
[2022-12-07 17:35:27] <%Basuzu> as profile pic you had the gloves skin? i know 1 or 2 asian who would swipe for that
[2022-12-07 17:35:29] <%FDeppy> i like being alone, but being lonely sucks
[2022-12-07 17:35:31] <%HonorNecris> Yeah, same.
[2022-12-07 17:35:38] <Stymi3> its all your time. pretty nice
[2022-12-07 17:35:41] <@%$Breakspear> kleier 100%. My ex said she received 5-10 dick pics a day. And some were creepy as fuck
[2022-12-07 17:35:43] <%ZCrimes> @FDeppy truth
[2022-12-07 17:35:45] <%slide12345678> just joined the stream, havent been around a lot - did he and kel split up? i'm clueless
[2022-12-07 17:35:45] <%Lauralyss> So true @FDeppy
[2022-12-07 17:35:48] <%brenny___> @kleier there's a reason all of us are on dating apps atpRtsd
[2022-12-07 17:35:51] <+DaveNF> Me to, been alone for a few years and I don't care at all.

[2022-12-07 17:36:07] <%+nubbykins> lol break you are literally explaining why you met Kel... you focused on yourself and made yourself super sexy to  others
[2022-12-07 17:36:08] <%brenny___> @slide12345678 no we're talking about dating
[2022-12-07 17:36:09] <%+FatOldPixel> I met my missus when Plenty of Fish was a massive thing and Tinder wasn't a thing. 12 years and a kid. Crazy thing is in them 12 years we have had 2 arguments
[2022-12-07 17:36:12] <%FDeppy> not having any friends might be an issue KEKW
[2022-12-07 17:36:13] <%+GlasVelo> I always seem to get chatted up by guys...at my age you need to take that as a compliment!
[2022-12-07 17:36:18] <%slide12345678> @brenny___ ok thanks - that's good

[2022-12-07 17:37:29] <%HonorNecris> This is all very cathartic

[2022-12-07 17:38:16] <%kleier> lucky
[2022-12-07 17:38:18] <%GreenxDiamond> Pancakes or Waffles?
[2022-12-07 17:38:19] <%kleier> anxiety is the worst
[2022-12-07 17:38:23] <Yurizan> Hey dude just wanna say hi, long time no see <3
[2022-12-07 17:38:41] <+ReKoill> Medication is the answer...not the fix...but its the answer you are usually given YEP
[2022-12-07 17:38:45] <%+DaveNF> I have social anxiety. Had a few pills, done with it all just made me feel worse
[2022-12-07 17:38:48] <%kleier> yeah imagine feeling like that all the time for no reason KEKL
[2022-12-07 17:38:50] <%kleier> it sucks
[2022-12-07 17:38:54] <%+ManSolo> Generalised anxiety disorder sucks
[2022-12-07 17:39:09] <%$Wiinnggg> Anyone that has debilitating anxiety is rough, but anxiety is a normal thing and I think it is banded about like a reason not to try stuff. True anxiety is tough as!
[2022-12-07 17:39:14] <%brenny___> thought I had ball cancer earlier this year, worst anxiety I've ever felt waiting for results
[2022-12-07 17:39:20] <+Tails94> Talk to a doctor, medication isnt scary as its made out. You dont become a zombie, it does really help
[2022-12-07 17:39:26] <%EnderKilgannon> I have C-PTSD and GAD and I think therapy and meditation and medication (until your mind is right or at least better) is the best way
[2022-12-07 17:39:27] <+ReKoill> Anxiety and depression, the perfect brain cocktail peepoLife
[2022-12-07 17:39:38] <%FDeppy> massive 5km run
[2022-12-07 17:39:46] <+ReKoill> Massive run to the chippy
[2022-12-07 17:39:47] <%+SmilerBull> we have a guy who had a life event happen and it caused him to be anxious. He's now got that bad with shakes in his hands that we had to change his job role. sucks as he's a really nice guy.
[2022-12-07 17:39:48] <%+Luffwoto> doing intense daily exercise really helped me with anxiety / low moods.
[2022-12-07 17:39:48] <Guades> what've I walked in to
[2022-12-07 17:39:56] <%$Wiinnggg> @Tails94 if you can get to see a dr, and once you have got to see said doctor, hope they are actually good at their job!!!
[2022-12-07 17:40:05] <%LkyJ21> get outside and  TouchGrass
[2022-12-07 17:40:05] <%+FatOldPixel> i'm lonely in the fact i don't have that best friend that i can go down the pub with, meet up with. This happened when i moved from England to Scotland, never been able to connect with anyone on that level but hey, we carry on
[2022-12-07 17:40:17] <%kleier> when i was at my worst SSRIs and beta blockers and CBT saved my life
[2022-12-07 17:40:19] <TheGreenFellow> @Tails94 hit or miss, I have bad memories from a kid who was constantly on meds in boy scouts. never found out if he got life straightened out
[2022-12-07 17:40:30] <+beakmull> you need to try to live in the moment
[2022-12-07 17:40:30] <+yngotto> reading these replies and hearing you talk really helps, thanks break, and chat
[2022-12-07 17:40:36] <%hashmanZA> @Tails94 100% can agree. was on Zoloft for depression for over 10 years and it was a literal life saver. coming off it now and doing good.
[2022-12-07 17:40:41] <%kleier> i couldn't even get out of bed at times let alone exercise
[2022-12-07 17:40:41] <%Maxwell_IV> I think its not just excercise but the consistency, being able to get up and do something consistently really helps
[2022-12-07 17:40:42] <Guades> @FatOldPixel sounds like you should rebrand to ChubbyGreyDot

[2022-12-07 17:41:52] <%+ManSolo> I have Generalised anxiety and depression. On medication since I was 20. It really does help. That combined with therapy helps. We really need to dispel the stigma of getting help and especially around medication

[2022-12-07 17:45:46] <fluffybunnywhiskers> The point about taking responsibility is an important one, I'd say, as a psychologist myself. Lots of talk therapy is basically centered on empowering people to question their behaviors and take responsibility.

[2022-12-07 17:49:49] <%oyarrayo> Also, grieving for the loss of a relationship is difficult and important to process as well.
[2022-12-07 17:49:51] <%EnderKilgannon> Yeah my Father in law said "your generation doesn't hang out with others or interact, no wonder your all in therapy and on meds" I replied with "your generation told us to man up and is one to talk, you guys cover your problems in work and alcohol."
