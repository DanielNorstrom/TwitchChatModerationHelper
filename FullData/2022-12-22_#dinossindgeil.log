[2022-12-22 16:02:55] <grabier2> botw is the only one that comes to mind
[2022-12-22 16:02:56] <+xlawson> AC Odyssey is my favorite open world. ER is second
[2022-12-22 16:02:59] <IAteYourPants> Gothic 1 + 2 are epic and sadly never got the attention it deservs
[2022-12-22 16:03:02] <%+TheLeviathong> Breath of the Wild raised the bar, and Elden Ring followed suit
[2022-12-22 16:03:02] <+da5abu> 1 yr difference
[2022-12-22 16:03:04] <%+blonky19> Breath of the Wild and Elden Ring are the GOAT open worlds imo
[2022-12-22 16:03:08] <+da5abu> lol
[2022-12-22 16:03:11] <%+blonky19> Witcher 3 is close behind
[2022-12-22 16:03:30] <%aredmongoose> I can't get into the assassin's creed games.
[2022-12-22 16:03:32] <%+Kittyhavoc> I really dont like how they separated open world into chunks with giant cliffs everywhere that you have to navigate around through dedicated passageways, it does not feel open at all
[2022-12-22 16:03:36] <%xsierraleone> nah while I liked ac odyssey, the world was way too big
[2022-12-22 16:03:36] <%aredmongoose> I get bored quickly
[2022-12-22 16:03:49] <%Dooglie> KHITD catJAM
[2022-12-22 16:03:56] <%TwelfthCrusader> I love Odyssey but for me it was very guided and I prefer Elden Ring's exploration approach
[2022-12-22 16:03:57] <SeVVerRat> To me botw is my fave, the map just has a tad more variety to offer than ER but it's a close second
[2022-12-22 16:03:58] <masamoon> KHITD
[2022-12-22 16:03:59] <%jnius_> ER has a very different story telling too which really makes it stand out from the others
[2022-12-22 16:04:09] <HereticMoon> theres a boss further down

[2022-12-22 16:04:22] <%Neuromod> Hey Nico how's it going? Just got back from the office Christmas party and I'm a bit drunk.
[2022-12-22 16:04:24] <%remiri> elden ring has lore
[2022-12-22 16:04:26] <%+blonky19> the climbing in Breath of the Wild puts it #1 for me. Nothing off limits
[2022-12-22 16:04:29] <%remiri> not much of a story
[2022-12-22 16:04:39] <%remiri> story is emergent
[2022-12-22 16:04:46] <%manwiththings> it's super basic, but I do a full playthrough of Skyrim every year. I just love that game so much
[2022-12-22 16:04:57] <+KnarrenHeinz666> Due to depressive phase I had time to play Assassins creed Odyssey, Origins and Valhalla. The open wolrd burns you totally out.
[2022-12-22 16:05:00] <%remiri> it is why im happy ER didnt win best narrative
[2022-12-22 16:05:04] <%meinMestar> Khaas_ NODDERS i got everything out of it by watching a let's play, i bought it but  dropped it because i  justs didnt like the gameplay NOPERS
[2022-12-22 16:05:04] <%CableSeadreamer> destiny 2 delivers narrative in a similar way. lots of item descriptions
[2022-12-22 16:05:05] <%remiri> cause there is no narrative
[2022-12-22 16:05:05] <%+Kittyhavoc> Yes
[2022-12-22 16:05:05] <%jnius_> well... yeah, so the story telling is through hidden lore, wouldn't that make it story telling too? I might be dumb sorry
[2022-12-22 16:05:08] <HereticMoon> theres a boss down there dont miss it PepeHands
[2022-12-22 16:05:25] <%+rogerdandy> yup
[2022-12-22 16:05:31] <%+rogerdandy> loops around on itself
[2022-12-22 16:05:43] <hambono> Theres a really high level of curation with the open spaces
[2022-12-22 16:05:44] <%+TheLeviathong> It's a genius design, because it allows the game to have levels within an open world. Like dungeons in Zelda
[2022-12-22 16:05:45] <FLUFFYmaster97> If you want a good story, you should play bloodborne
[2022-12-22 16:05:55] <%Neuromod> I like the fromSoft kind of story telling. It's like putting together pieces of a puzzle.
[2022-12-22 16:05:57] <%+rogerdandy> naw it's so good

[2022-12-22 16:14:24] <flushyflesh> these bosses are the worst..

[2022-12-22 16:14:40] <%+rogerdandy> can we get it to fall off?

[2022-12-22 16:14:53] <%remiri> only last 7 sec but should be ok
[2022-12-22 16:14:55] <%+moosemaster17> if you have enough stats for the black knife that would also be sick
[2022-12-22 16:15:04] <%Dooglie> These bosses are definitely part of the reason I think this run hitless would be impossible. This one isnt too bad but there are 2 others that you have to fight in very small spaces.
[2022-12-22 16:15:14] <%+rogerdandy> he's powered up now?
[2022-12-22 16:15:26] <$YaFOOOOOOOOOL> maybe the tree will fall on him
[2022-12-22 16:15:27] <hambono> can we trick this tree spirit off the edge?!

[2022-12-22 16:15:40] <%remiri> @Dooglie hitless is out of the question simply due to the length of the run
[2022-12-22 16:15:47] <%remiri> single segment hitless sure
[2022-12-22 16:15:53] <%remiri> multi*

[2022-12-22 16:16:50] <$YaFOOOOOOOOOL> can the tree thingy fall off the bridge?

[2022-12-22 16:17:09] <%meinMestar> you can but they have pretty high rot res
[2022-12-22 16:17:14] <%+gaffnasty88> This run hitless still?
[2022-12-22 16:17:16] <thecyberhorst> is the black knife dagger good in this run?
[2022-12-22 16:17:20] <%Dooglie> But thats just doing the whole thing hitlesss...
[2022-12-22 16:17:24] <%Dooglie> no?
[2022-12-22 16:17:25] <HereticMoon> you can rot it but its strong against it
[2022-12-22 16:17:45] <%Dooglie> Unless you dont restart if you get hit of course
[2022-12-22 16:17:46] <%remiri> @Dooglie it is allowing you to segment the run so you dont have to reset the whole thing if you get hit in late game
[2022-12-22 16:17:53] <flushyflesh> a region lock all bosses no hit would be fun to watch
[2022-12-22 16:17:56] <%+Smomotion> @thecyberhorst i'm still on my first playthough doing sl1 [lol] but since i got black knife dagger it's been pretty great
[2022-12-22 16:17:58] <%remiri> try to do each zone hitless
[2022-12-22 16:18:13] <%Dooglie> remiri ya that I would say is definitely doable

[2022-12-22 16:52:52] <%thekidindigo> pebble also has a quicker cast time, so you can roll react quicker.
[2022-12-22 16:52:52] <deyocalypse> those delayed spells the wolf uses also slap and are pretty accurate/fast

[2022-12-22 18:10:46] <hemiak> It seems like no shield more damage. Other attacks are quicker so better reaction time.
[2022-12-22 18:10:46] <%Baryon23> the nice thing about the poke is you have time to roll out and it uses very little stamina

[2022-12-22 18:21:13] <%Baryon23> @dinossindgeil are you allowed to use pre-upgraded weapons like Rogier's rapier?
[2022-12-22 18:21:19] <Nekrazero> gideon can be cheesed with poison and rot potions without actually aggroing him
[2022-12-22 18:21:34] <hemiak> Nothing upgraded.
[2022-12-22 18:21:38] <%Lickers__> you can cheese Gideon with rot pot and poison pots like Gino does

[2022-12-22 18:22:08] <%BenderZGreat> I'd say no

[2022-12-22 18:22:09] <%MegatonLink> play it safe
[2022-12-22 18:22:11] <%BenderZGreat> the idea is +0 weapons
