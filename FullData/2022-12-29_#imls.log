[2022-12-29 23:40:53] <+Whoryu__> Looking for a female roomate to pay $0 rent I will not charge you money, but I will be sharing my bed with you as the other room is being used by my parents. They are aware of this arrangement as I have done this before but it has not worked out for reasons rather not say on here. I will expect hugs at least 5 times a day, and cuddles at least 2 times a day for at least 10 minutes each. You will not be dating any other man during this arrangement, you will have no male friends either.

[2022-12-29 23:51:37] <+Kazhixyt> I think Max saw something in like structures that we cant see as spectators and after 2+ years of being in NA and not being able to beat EU teams and even less CN and KR teams NA is like a minor league compared to others and for money many players said that the money is way better as a content creator compared to being a player or coach

[2022-12-29 23:51:40] <CripplingCranberry> So he is not going to stream, not going to coach and instead will be messing aroudn with girls in his bedroom. His resolve has gone down and he just wants to mess aroudn with OF girls in LA and go out to parties each week. He says NA is bad but it is beacuse of people like him who refuse to keep on going and keep on getting better, this is why the East will always be better and why coaches like Xiao Rui Lin in LDLC will find much more success.

He says NA is bad but it is beacuse of people like him who refuse to keep on going and keep on getting better, this is why the East will always be better and why coaches like Xiao Rui Lin in LDLC will find much more success.

[2022-12-29 23:58:41] <vupvoyyocyo> LS I know you are reading my messages right now, you can 'guy in chat' me but I am 100% right about this. Max has lost his resolve he doesnt want to stream nor coach and is wasting his time messing around wiht girls. HE is the very probelm he talks about just look at his stream right now, people messing around not taking stuff seriously. Coach Damanvir Saran and Xiao Rui Lin from the LDL will never have this type of mindset and this is exactly why the east will be so much more succesful.
