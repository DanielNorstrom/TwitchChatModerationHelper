[2023-01-03 13:12:32] <GaBane22> compared to another game that's very small
[2023-01-03 13:12:38] <yarpenzinger> it's the same with the witcher netflix show

[2023-01-03 13:13:16] <RC_Sev> It can be summed up that Gwent is a great game with a unique concept but was handled by bad devs

[2023-01-03 13:13:19] <johnnyriso> Its a toxic relationship, they keep making promises and, since players love Gwent, they want to believe them, even when everything and everyone can see that they wont change

[2023-01-03 13:13:59] <@%zubedoo> I wont be surprised if Snap dies with Gwent KEKG
[2023-01-03 13:14:00] <shashank0034> why does snap have no potential
[2023-01-03 13:14:01] <@%zubedoo> in 2024
[2023-01-03 13:14:02] <johnnyriso> Does it need to be a card game?
[2023-01-03 13:14:05] <owlberte> storybook brawl when @spyro_za
[2023-01-03 13:14:06] <criticalinfusion> i am starting the MTG A fee to play collection and got like all starter decks and one meta tier 3 deck and its already far more enjoyable than Snap and comparable to gwont
[2023-01-03 13:14:10] <kavinskky> OceanMud is alive because of Snap tbh, was strugling for a while and now getting 400 viewers
[2023-01-03 13:14:15] <shashank0034> are u guys living in reality?
[2023-01-03 13:14:31] <shashank0034> people getting 500 viewers in snap
[2023-01-03 13:14:36] <$MaNIIacXs> @idontliketwitch3 KEKW
[2023-01-03 13:14:38] <shashank0034> really easily
[2023-01-03 13:14:57] <johnnyriso> Speci is doing fine now with Snap
[2023-01-03 13:14:57] <%sp1cy_gr> The thing is longevity tho. Snap is new and still has hype
[2023-01-03 13:15:04] <idontliketwitch3> @kavinskky Yeah, I remember his gwent stuff getting ~100. Good to see him prospering
[2023-01-03 13:15:05] <shashank0034> new streamers, with 0 audience get 100s of viewers consistently
[2023-01-03 13:15:11] <shashank0034> because they got in early
[2023-01-03 13:15:12] <@^StreamElements> If you are enjoying the stream, don't forget to leave a follow to keep updated of when I go live :)
[2023-01-03 13:15:19] <beefbufff> also freddybabes is back with snap
[2023-01-03 13:15:20] <@%zubedoo> Snap is nowhere close to where Gwent used to be when that had started
[2023-01-03 13:15:23] <kavinskky> @idontliketwitch3 i remember Ocean Getting 1k at gwent Sadge

[2023-01-03 13:15:36] <yarpenzinger> @shashank0034 freddybabes was back with 17 viewers
[2023-01-03 13:15:39] <@%zubedoo> I think gwent used to get 20K viewers in its category at one point
[2023-01-03 13:15:46] <@%zubedoo> Snap hits 9K at best
[2023-01-03 13:15:50] <shashank0034> nope, Freddy had 200-300 viewers
[2023-01-03 13:15:53] <@%zubedoo> for a new CCG thats bad
[2023-01-03 13:15:56] <shashank0034> that on day before patch
[2023-01-03 13:16:01] <shashank0034> on a slow day
[2023-01-03 13:16:08] <shashank0034> and he's new to snap
[2023-01-03 13:16:15] <gacsam> but he's cute
[2023-01-03 13:16:17] <%notlvcatto> Yo chat, This is Spicy. Keep on Plotge
[2023-01-03 13:16:21] <@%zubedoo> and when people tell me "Bro it won Mobile GOTY" please leave it KEKL
[2023-01-03 13:16:31] <FunkyGreenOG> How about variety of single player games.....GOW , Elder RIng...etc  ???
[2023-01-03 13:16:31] <kavinskky> snap will be dead by the end of this year, unless the "real" streamers keep playing it
[2023-01-03 13:16:32] <%sp1cy_gr> mobile G OMEGALUL TY
[2023-01-03 13:16:39] <shashank0034> @spyro_za it's great for streaming rn, trust me. lots of fragmentation in viewers.
[2023-01-03 13:16:47] <%notlvcatto> @zubedoo Mobile GOTY feels very Rigged . Cant believe they manage to snatch the award
[2023-01-03 13:16:49] <@%zubedoo> @sp1cy_gr bro it beat some other ass games OMEGALUL
[2023-01-03 13:16:53] <shashank0034> like, all streamers have viewers
[2023-01-03 13:17:00] <@%zubedoo> @notlvcatto regardless the other games on mobile were shit anyways
[2023-01-03 13:17:00] <HeyYou1989> dont go snap please.. try mtg it will be hard to learn but game is perfectly balanced sińce year

[2023-01-03 13:17:20] <johnnyriso> @zubedoo Right now it's usually just a few hundreds, and half of them is either Spyro or Shinmiri: when both aren't streaming, it doesn't get past 200
[2023-01-03 13:17:23] <@%zubedoo> @Spyro_ZA honestly why arent you going for MTGA

[2023-01-03 13:17:41] <@%zubedoo> @johnnyriso yeah now the game is reaching its end, so it makes sense
[2023-01-03 13:17:46] <criticalinfusion> i would love to see SPyro streaming MTG
[2023-01-03 13:17:48] <%sp1cy_gr> MTG -> safer long term but harder to get into Snap -> easier to get into but questionable longevity basically?
[2023-01-03 13:18:01] <shashank0034> @spyro_za Freddy is low levelled too, and he gets 200-300 viewers. speci gets 1k
[2023-01-03 13:18:01] <@%zubedoo> MTG is basically the chess of CCGs
[2023-01-03 13:18:05] <jbarrios08> I really thought the Gwent was going to be like magic, a long-term game :(
[2023-01-03 13:18:05] <@%zubedoo> it will never die
[2023-01-03 13:18:16] <FunkyGreenOG> Yugi - OH ? ?
[2023-01-03 13:18:19] <@%zubedoo> and its made by competent CCG makers
[2023-01-03 13:18:20] <johnnyriso> MTG is SOOO hard to get into, it has decades of cards
[2023-01-03 13:18:25] <arezlive> your deck is disgusting
[2023-01-03 13:18:30] <@%zubedoo> @johnnyriso but that part is fun too
[2023-01-03 13:18:39] <criticalinfusion> maybe that means there is a place to shine
[2023-01-03 13:18:48] <criticalinfusion> for someone
[2023-01-03 13:18:48] <@%zubedoo> and its heavily competitive right? @johnnyriso
[2023-01-03 13:18:54] <@%zubedoo> thats what spyro is looking for
[2023-01-03 13:18:59] <Cordial_insipidity> Mythgard will relaunch later this year. Used to be run by a very small crew, but now it's bought by a huge company.
[2023-01-03 13:19:00] <johnnyriso> @zubedoo Its also not very f2p friendly xD
[2023-01-03 13:19:05] <criticalinfusion> to get consecutive high viewership
[2023-01-03 13:19:13] <walidkadaben> if you continu with gwent you will be the only one who stream on it , and i think its  a good thing
[2023-01-03 13:19:13] <@%zubedoo> thats what rasheed told me
[2023-01-03 13:19:16] <kavinskky> only because of the patch, few days ago there was noone there
[2023-01-03 13:19:19] <shashank0034> compare that to snap @spyro_za. compare the followers to viewers

[2023-01-03 13:26:08] <criticalinfusion> So you need to roll on Snap which might be overhyped on roll MTG with a possibility of medium channel at best. Either of 2 risks

[2023-01-03 13:26:55] <+RoaringHillock> guys you can't consider 3k from streaming as being just like getting 3k from a job. Spyro takes practically no vacation, streams for 40+h a week and is subject to events outside his control like CDPR stopping support

[2023-01-03 13:32:37] <criticalinfusion> Feels like Snap is quite a risk, like in crypto while MTG a bit safer but with lower possible return so that;s economical decision at the end of the day and a roll

[2023-01-03 13:44:02] <kavinskky> it;s not about only liking Gwent,  no one only likes one thing, it's more about disliking other games, like Snap for example
[2023-01-03 13:44:04] <%sp1cy_gr> tbh I would never play another CCG after Gwent, no way Im paying real money to get cards OMEGALUL
[2023-01-03 13:44:13] <@%+xahverius> they're just bad at monetizing
[2023-01-03 13:44:15] <Rasmalai06> is Gwent a pay to win?
[2023-01-03 13:44:16] <%insilico_man> with gwent being too free to play i agree totally NODDERS
[2023-01-03 13:44:30] <%+reryaa> they're bad with numbers so is money making KEKL
[2023-01-03 13:44:31] <+Tmaserati> This much free to play requires a lot larger audience
[2023-01-03 13:44:35] <Bairis> @Rasmalai06 nope, you can buy kegs if you want to but they give them away like candy
[2023-01-03 13:44:45] <criticalinfusion> Yeah the Gwont was fine while CDPR had lots of money and when the last year kicked in they spring was cut off
[2023-01-03 13:44:48] <%insilico_man> cdpr needed to hire some people with experience at online games to better monetize it
[2023-01-03 13:44:58] <%notlvcatto> @insilico_man Sadge
[2023-01-03 13:45:04] <%BAPreda> ok speero but are u surprised, this is cdpr's very first multiplayer game
[2023-01-03 13:45:08] <yarpenzinger> well what about legends of runneterra the monetization is much worse than gwent everything is so cheap

[2023-01-03 13:45:42] <WiiseOne> But even with the game being free to play it still wasn't bringing in the viewers
[2023-01-03 13:46:08] <criticalinfusion> i mean if you drop like 10 free expansions that was bound to happen when the CDPR support wasn't there
[2023-01-03 13:46:13] <%+reryaa> I literally see Snap in every ad now
[2023-01-03 13:46:15] <@%+xahverius> but most of us spent on journeys. I bought all  of them
[2023-01-03 13:46:33] <kavinskky> song for Gwent ABCDEFU Sadge
[2023-01-03 13:46:37] <+Tmaserati> I bought two journeys and an expansion pack
[2023-01-03 13:46:56] <%insilico_man> @xahverius yeah same. but not everyone can or did
[2023-01-03 13:47:00] <+RoaringHillock> @xahverius tbh compared to other games, paying a total of 60 bucks for a full collection is incredibly generous
[2023-01-03 13:47:07] <%insilico_man> they needed a better model to monetize gwent
[2023-01-03 13:47:12] <@^StreamElements> Play Yumon. the first ever content creator fantasy league with my exclusive cards and support the channel: https://app.yumon.world/creators/spyro_za/booster

[2023-01-03 13:47:48] <kavinskky> Imagine investing hundreds of € in the game for it to go Deadge Sadge
[2023-01-03 13:47:53] <%sp1cy_gr> thats why i dont play KEKW but Duel Links was nice
[2023-01-03 13:47:59] <criticalinfusion> it feels like they wanted to accomplish this free tp play experience to some point but they support was cut off and they had to deal with the mistakes
[2023-01-03 13:48:13] <kavinskky> @reryaa Same Sadge at least we supported what we loved
[2023-01-03 13:48:23] <jbarrios08> In retrospective everything seems easy
[2023-01-03 13:48:42] <@^StreamElements> Did you know Spyro has a Youtube channel? Check it out here for more Gwent related content :) https://www.youtube.com/c/SpyroZAGwent
[2023-01-03 13:48:52] <@%+xahverius> I imagine they had a plan to make it the most played card game, then start monetizing hard
[2023-01-03 13:48:55] <%sp1cy_gr> Journeys were a great idea and good value, I'd rather have this system with cosmetics over paying real money for cards
[2023-01-03 13:48:58] <yarpenzinger> every new card comes out the last new card becomes irrelevant
[2023-01-03 13:49:12] <criticalinfusion> @xahverius exactly but couldnt do that since CDPR flunked

[2023-01-03 13:56:01] <criticalinfusion> the CDPR shares before Cyberpunk relase were worth 4 times of its current value so honestly i think its just this giant problem + pandemic + crisis that killed gwent as the monetization kicked them back in the ass as there was no space for furher support and they had to invest in new witcher franchise
[2023-01-03 13:56:08] <jbarrios08> Bushy was a visionary of this lmao

[2023-01-03 14:01:50] <$MaNIIacXs> @Spyro_ZA play yugioh  spyroza
[2023-01-03 14:01:56] <marianparuwa> Shooter games also stimulate your senses with very little intelectual involvement, whereas card games rely on ppls creativity
[2023-01-03 14:02:39] <afel100> im curious when W4 comes out it will definitly have gwent as a mini game so maybe then they will release Gwent 2 or somethink xD

[2023-01-03 14:23:56] <%+reryaa> I play it a couple of times it's perfect for potty time @xahverius
[2023-01-03 14:23:59] <shashank0034> @xahverius u talking about snap?
[2023-01-03 14:24:00] <idontliketwitch3> @kavinskky Yeah. Was a "I told you so moment" for many people but those moments are always bitter
[2023-01-03 14:24:07] <@%+xahverius> yes
[2023-01-03 14:24:08] <shashank0034> snap is fun, but it's new
[2023-01-03 14:24:13] <mickeyAD_> Snap Aware
[2023-01-03 14:24:17] <+Aethren> its ok spyro we are all afraid of getting out of our comfort zone, but the growth is always on the other side of fear
[2023-01-03 14:24:20] <+Aethren> you will do great
[2023-01-03 14:24:24] <+Aethren> i am sure of it
[2023-01-03 14:24:26] <mickeyAD_> magic would be interesting
[2023-01-03 14:24:27] <%+reryaa> snap is fun for HamStare brain level
[2023-01-03 14:24:31] <rrslayer34> Speki has almost a thousand viewers now, he's popping off
[2023-01-03 14:24:33] <@%+xahverius> Shashank are you a snap sponsor? Susge
[2023-01-03 14:24:34] <@^Nightbot> HamStare
[2023-01-03 14:24:34] <%notlvcatto> @xahverius Dont man, I almost quit if not for being extremely lucky, getting the S tier key card from my drop
[2023-01-03 14:24:36] <shashank0034> snap Pog
[2023-01-03 14:24:41] <J3hzy> Do u have any other game genres ur into besides card games?
[2023-01-03 14:24:42] <%criticalinfusion> i mean an hour of magic a day is what i am doing right now
[2023-01-03 14:24:45] <shashank0034> @reryaa HamStare
[2023-01-03 14:24:49] <%notlvcatto> Being able to use it on 3+ different decks is HUGE
[2023-01-03 14:24:57] <@%+xahverius> @notlvcatto I mean, if spyro switches I will have to
[2023-01-03 14:25:14] <kavinskky> i'm sure you'll do fine, you always seemed way cooler than speki for example and he's doing well @Spyro_ZA
[2023-01-03 14:25:17] <shashank0034> snap has most cards with some niche
[2023-01-03 14:25:23] <Diviora> i told u at the end of the stream do some snap to check how much ppl will stick around
[2023-01-03 14:25:24] <%notlvcatto> @xahverius Sadge, fair enough. Just pray to the NRG gods for your card drops in series 3
[2023-01-03 14:25:24] <shashank0034> but it is pay2win
[2023-01-03 14:25:28] <thatcheese02> !decks

[2023-01-03 14:25:59] <@%+xahverius> Spyro_ZA yes I think it's not a good idea, except if you're a super-streamer like xqc
[2023-01-03 14:26:04] <J3hzy> Unless ur a variety steamer yeah
[2023-01-03 14:26:08] <shashank0034> u have to choose 1
[2023-01-03 14:26:33] <rrslayer34> I actually watched a video explaining snap so now I'm a bit less clueless of whats going on there
[2023-01-03 14:26:38] <shashank0034> i feel u will be good in snap @spyro_za
[2023-01-03 14:26:39] <yarpenzinger> unless u play rpgs

[2023-01-03 14:26:50] <J3hzy> U either have to be fully into entertainment or focus on the game itself

[2023-01-03 14:27:58] <mutarre11> Variety is good when people watch the stream for the streamer as a person, not for the gameplay
[2023-01-03 14:28:03] <shashank0034> @spyro_za new snap streamers are getting good number of viewers
[2023-01-03 14:28:07] <PastyMcGee> this isnt the place to talk about it
[2023-01-03 14:28:32] <+Aethren> Swim bad bad man
[2023-01-03 14:28:34] <+Aethren> in short
[2023-01-03 14:28:55] <%criticalinfusion> Not entirely for the streamer but when you have like world records in speedruning like Souls then you can also play other games for similar achievments and switch varierty

[2023-01-03 15:28:24] <tumy99> @hippotompotomus my guess is they wanted to grow the gwent mark with rogue mage in eschange to losing development potential in actual Gwent. Might aswell have spent in better marketing instead

[2023-01-03 16:13:18] <@%+xahverius> this year they're still releasing 72 but we all talking like if it's 2024 already KEKW devs fault for announcing it so early
[2023-01-03 16:13:23] <@%+xahverius> 72 cards
[2023-01-03 16:13:32] <%insilico_man> i agree
[2023-01-03 16:13:58] <%insilico_man> they should have just announced like in june july or smth
[2023-01-03 16:14:00] <@%+xahverius> @insilico_man yep i mean with all due respect to streamers, it's a business, they should have announced it after the last release
[2023-01-03 16:14:14] <%evershadow> Devs could have waited until after the remaster, but I'm glad they announced it early

[2023-01-03 16:14:58] <%evershadow> They can't really give a road map and hide that they're ending it though
[2023-01-03 16:15:01] <%insilico_man> i think it was a corporate decision and dev team had to follow
[2023-01-03 16:15:10] <+Jekkfje> either they waited until the end and said it and it would have been bad or they announce it early which kills the hype for new cards and the game in general which is also bad
