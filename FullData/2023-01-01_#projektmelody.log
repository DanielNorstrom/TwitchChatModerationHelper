[2023-01-01 03:39:27] <%+StarmashYT> Well usually theres permissions for that
[2023-01-01 03:39:27] <%+Phyn1x__> i know how it feels
[2023-01-01 03:39:27] <%+sonic_slades> Think of it this way, next year for 2023, we can celebrate it twice as hard to make up for this year.
[2023-01-01 03:39:28] <%a0plus> yup pmelPat
[2023-01-01 03:39:31] <grassairr> okay, then go sleep. better for you to rest and heal than work burned out
[2023-01-01 03:39:32] <%+paraquat__> I hate that I was able to follow that logic
[2023-01-01 03:39:34] <whiskeycoke4> Maybe your just pregnant
[2023-01-01 03:39:34] <%$kafkonia> Do like Zen did during her subathon and sleep stream with alerts on?
[2023-01-01 03:39:35] <%+Alphacombat92> thats called a parasite
[2023-01-01 03:39:35] <%Drakkar00000> if it makes u feel any better I'm not healing and had a nap earlier, still fighting off sleep
[2023-01-01 03:39:36] <BloodAsp20XX> if you're feeling off theres no shame in calling it. Self care is important
[2023-01-01 03:39:44] <+Oddsalsa> I'm back
[2023-01-01 03:39:44] <%$ctm5151> Get some rest so your body can heal

[2023-01-01 03:40:00] <Hazmathus> Guess you didn't stock up your recovery reserves before surgery

[2023-01-01 03:40:02] <%+sonic_slades> He did, remix left it at the mall again.
[2023-01-01 03:40:02] <%$Phantasma__> remix has always been preggers.
[2023-01-01 03:40:02] <BumsAwayy> that's.. terrifying
[2023-01-01 03:40:04] <%+GuruBuckaroo> Think of surgery as having a very serious accident. It's a trauma. It's a *controlled* trauma, but it's still a trauma. Takes the body time to recover.

[2023-01-01 03:40:20] <%+sonic_slades> Nah, sleep in your bed.
[2023-01-01 03:40:22] <%+sonic_slades> It's more comfy.
[2023-01-01 03:40:23] <BloodAsp20XX> "I'm only Sleeping"
[2023-01-01 03:40:23] <%E_B_A_B_E> sleep stream with alerts on, that was a smart idea
[2023-01-01 03:40:24] <grassairr> the subathon right? like when u were sleeping?
[2023-01-01 03:40:24] <pizzagameing79> do you have any new years traditions
[2023-01-01 03:40:24] <+GBZero> recover first then do fun
[2023-01-01 03:40:25] <%ScienceTiny> probably best not to sleep in a chair right now
[2023-01-01 03:40:26] <%$fishy2951> your body is healing, so your baseline heart rate is higher and its sucking out the nutrients to feel the repair process
[2023-01-01 03:40:28] <%varajahl> You dont HAVE to be in the chair...
[2023-01-01 03:40:28] <JESover> she didnt sleep at all that day LUL
