[2022-12-30 15:09:02] <%Witzkatz> @dinossindgeil Apart from the obvious hilarity, I just learnt in another article that five women were found in several buildings he owns/was associated with - if those turn out to be witnesses, I'd hope he's done.  Some fanboys of him are claiming he was released already again thoguh?

[2022-12-30 15:14:31] <%Witzkatz> @meinMestar The judicial outlets in Romania are saying it has nothing to do with the pizza box, at least they are quoting saying that in a German article

[2022-12-30 15:14:51] <%akaleth> I've heard that it's not *really* because of Greta and the Romanian police were already closing in on him, but the timing is uncanny
[2022-12-30 15:15:00] <TysonJDevereaux> Yeah some people could argue that Tate is the reason behind his arrest since he shot himself in the foot, BUT Greta did use his ego to her own advantage, so... a W for Greta

[2022-12-30 15:40:24] <TysonJDevereaux> @DC_Itami Actually, yeah... it's weird. Elden Ring resistances are weird. Like how Mohg has more resist than Fire Giant.
[2022-12-30 15:40:26] <sylmir_> To finish the quest, you have to kill a Putrid Tree Spirit in the room with the Kindred of Rot, above Malenia's arena. Then, invade Millicent's world to help her or kill her

[2022-12-30 16:27:41] <%firefistf> she has basically unlimited rot resistance

[2022-12-30 16:27:43] <%BanjoTheUncle> I think you maybe rot her p1, but her resistance is super high
[2022-12-30 16:27:43] <%remiri> you have to parry 3x for one riposte tho
[2022-12-30 16:27:44] <%+Farfalla_Vendetta_> she is not immun against rot.you need 1481 status points to inflict it
[2022-12-30 16:27:45] BAN: Farfalla_Vendetta_ (1s), Farfalla_Vendetta_ (1s), Farfalla_Vendetta_ (1s), Farfalla_Vendetta_ (1s)

[2022-12-30 16:27:48] <%yoyasuper> parry than black flame tornado maybe?
[2022-12-30 16:27:48] <+Bubford> I think phase one can be rotted
[2022-12-30 16:27:50] <%obijuann1> she is ROT
[2022-12-30 16:27:51] <%BenderZGreat> she has very high resistance to rot, not immune
[2022-12-30 16:28:03] <%Zormi> Use kicks, last person i saw kill malenia used that strat and it worked like a charm

[2022-12-30 16:28:06] <%BanjoTheUncle> Not sure about p2 though
[2022-12-30 16:28:10] <%akaleth> she's got like 1500 res, so I don't think it's realistic for you to rot her
[2022-12-30 16:28:14] <%BenderZGreat> you need to do like 1500 dmg to rot her
[2022-12-30 16:28:15] <keivan_k1_rezanejad> yes
[2022-12-30 16:28:27] <%katjers> well she is the godess of rot, she should be kinda immune KEKW

[2022-12-30 17:02:02] <%Zormi> @dinossindgeil How many stuff can you equip ? cause you can start each phase with flies anyways until she builds up a resistance for some "free" damage at least easier to land
[2022-12-30 17:02:05] <TysonJDevereaux> maybe do tornado for each safe attack opportunity? I mean, it maybe stuns her
