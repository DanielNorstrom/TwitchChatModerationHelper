[2022-12-27 14:11:05] <Halceon> You can keep the dining room unassigned, but you can't assign it to multiple specifice people.

[2022-12-27 14:15:09] <Misterbone> Check the tavern? If there's chests for storing stuff, you can put more things to drink out off.
[2022-12-27 14:15:18] <Halceon> trailofdebris Only the tavern keeper hands out the mugs from the chests. But you can have a mug stockpile nearby and dwarves will grab their own mugs.

[2022-12-27 14:15:38] <Misterbone> This game doesn't say "Tavern keeper needs more chests!" like starcraft.

[2022-12-27 14:31:34] <Misterbone> Man, reading through the combat logs is so confusing. If there was a mod that made all the actions into panels, this game would blow everyones minds.
[2022-12-27 14:32:23] <Volmancer> There are a lot of great mods already. UI Tweaks is almost a must have for me
[2022-12-27 14:32:24] <Halceon> Combat is VERY gory. I had a goblin siege recently that had 7 beheadings.

[2022-12-27 14:47:32] <brrrako> hard to tell the value unless you have a lot of knowledge about stone values and such
[2022-12-27 14:47:43] <brrrako> otherwise you'd just look at the furniture inside and add up their values to get a general sense
[2022-12-27 14:47:54] <mad_wack> what quality are the items
[2022-12-27 14:47:56] <brrrako> because the walls and floor all add value as well
[2022-12-27 14:48:02] <mad_wack> looks like ~600* room imo
[2022-12-27 14:48:03] <+Lefurjah> Metal is better than rock. If you can upgrade to iron table/throne/etc

[2022-12-27 14:55:53] <Lowtsie> my impression is that this game has an identity problem in terms of how many things it should simulate vs where should just not
[2022-12-27 14:56:00] <mad_wack> tombs have quality levels too
[2022-12-27 14:56:08] <+GruntyThrst> Correct, a "tomb" is a higher level room than a "grave"
[2022-12-27 14:56:29] <+Stef90> @Lowtsie just about every body part is simulated in DF, it's pretty crazy :D
[2022-12-27 14:56:35] <+DoctorLuk> In Rimworld you often need to micromanage (because of mental breakdowns). I see 118 Pop, so does this one rather challenge you to build in a bigger scale rather than manage every pop individually?

[2022-12-27 14:58:08] <Neroxen_> @DoctorLuk Dwarf fortress is all about macromanagement, so it doesn't really challenge you other than with the logistics
[2022-12-27 14:58:13] <Captain_Onosa> lol a dwarf feel asleep on the roof
[2022-12-27 14:58:35] <mad_wack> there are some parts of the game with lots of micro, like the justice system or working with the military but yeah mostly the dwarves do an ok job looking after themselves

[2022-12-27 15:00:35] <Volmancer> I once accidentally had too few stepladders and had set too many dwarves to gather, ensuring theft of in-use stepladders, leaving poor dwarves stranded in tall trees, dehydrated and eventually dead. I was so clueless about the missing dwarves notifications and later on, how they were so high in trees like that in the first place until I saw a dwarf swipe a stepladder again a bit later and shortly later the other was reported missing. This game is bananas XD

I'm leaving on a multi month backpacking trip to south-east asia on Saturday and wanted to thank you all for the cozy vibes so far as I will not be able to tune in as often at the start of the year heepoLove
[2022-12-27 16:06:25] <%+TelinArtho> ultimately, he was very upset. But I think he got over it

[2022-12-27 16:45:52] <%Draksis45> @2DKiri from wikipedia: The moulds were laid out in sand beds such that they could be fed from a common runner. The group of moulds resembled a litter of sucking pigs, the ingots being called “pigs” and the runner the “sow.”
[2022-12-27 16:45:53] <%Truppenpanda> they got a nice image for that

[2022-12-27 16:46:34] <!%TheMoenia> no its just an ingredient
[2022-12-27 16:46:36] <+IamCaffy> leave it raw (not in block state)
[2022-12-27 16:46:36] <%CarloTheCurious> Flux is usable from raw stone
[2022-12-27 16:46:37] <%Neroxen_> you just need the flux stone as an ingredient
[2022-12-27 16:46:39] <%Truppenpanda> flux = flux stones you mined and have them somewhere in stock
[2022-12-27 16:46:39] <%+CodeMarvelous> Steel is an alloy where you use coke to make iron less heavy but stronger and more brittle.
[2022-12-27 16:46:43] <ole_hockey_thighs> nope, pig iron is just high carbon iron

[2022-12-27 16:48:46] <%Truppenpanda> @2DKiri blocks cant be used as ingredients. flux stone has to be regular stone.
[2022-12-27 16:48:51] <%CarloTheCurious> in Stone Use, if it's not checked for non-economic use they won't make blocks, etc from it (by default flux *is* checked)
[2022-12-27 16:49:11] <KimmyM420> You can see what different rock is used for under labor, and you can turn off the dwarves using fluxes to build with

[2022-12-27 16:55:01] <%CarloTheCurious> What you probably want is on labour / stone use, uncheck flux stones for non-economic :) . That way they won't use them for blocks, furniture, etc
[2022-12-27 16:55:26] <%janton527> you should be able to restrict economic from the labor menu?

[2022-12-27 16:57:13] <%CarloTheCurious> flux stones are checked by default. I guess 'cus you might want marble furniture or whatever
