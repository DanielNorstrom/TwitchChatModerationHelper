[2023-01-08 22:43:10] <%Manafy10> mage items just suck
[2023-01-08 22:43:11] <!%Deceiver_euw> Unless riot makes seraphs useless somehow
[2023-01-08 22:43:14] <%Manafy10> surely riot will give new items right?
[2023-01-08 22:43:57] <!%Deceiver_euw> I want riot to rework her already

[2023-01-08 22:44:21] <!%Deceiver_euw> Its funny cuz
[2023-01-08 22:44:32] <!%Deceiver_euw> What made her strong back then was gunblade and ravenlus hunter
[2023-01-08 22:44:34] <!%Deceiver_euw> Both are gone
[2023-01-08 22:44:38] <!%Deceiver_euw> But so is she

[2023-01-08 22:45:20] <%Manafy10> i know
[2023-01-08 22:45:27] <!%Deceiver_euw> I kinda did too at the time but if they only kept some things
[2023-01-08 22:45:43] <!%Deceiver_euw> Like the ult where u choose which spell
[2023-01-08 22:45:46] <%Manafy10> yeah
[2023-01-08 22:45:47] <!%Deceiver_euw> And a different passive
[2023-01-08 22:45:56] <%Manafy10> her passive where the marks right?
[2023-01-08 22:46:06] <!%Deceiver_euw> Cuz her passive is not bad it saves you once or twice a game but its such a pointless passive
[2023-01-08 22:46:06] <@^Nightbot> Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/c/Nemesis_lol/videos
[2023-01-08 22:46:14] <%Manafy10> yeah
[2023-01-08 22:46:30] <!%Deceiver_euw> This current kit with ult where she chooses which spell she can cast
[2023-01-08 22:46:35] <%Manafy10> so you think that lb is only bad bcs her items are bad rn?
[2023-01-08 22:46:37] <!%Deceiver_euw> And a new passive or improved
[2023-01-08 22:46:49] <!%Deceiver_euw> I mean
[2023-01-08 22:46:55] <!%Deceiver_euw> Look what everyone else is building
[2023-01-08 22:47:03] <!%Deceiver_euw> Every single mage buys hp at some point
[2023-01-08 22:47:07] <%Manafy10> yeah
[2023-01-08 22:47:08] <!%Deceiver_euw> Mr items are op af
[2023-01-08 22:47:24] <!%Deceiver_euw> U must be solo ap dmg or unplayable
[2023-01-08 22:47:33] <!%Deceiver_euw> Her matchups are still fine
[2023-01-08 22:47:34] <%Manafy10> makes sense
[2023-01-08 22:47:45] <!%Deceiver_euw> Just needs conditions by her team and enemy team
[2023-01-08 22:47:46] <!%Deceiver_euw> To be good
[2023-01-08 22:47:56] <%Manafy10> FeelsBadMan ap items are so horrible man
[2023-01-08 22:48:06] <%Manafy10> can we revert items already FeelsBadMan
[2023-01-08 22:48:10] <!%Deceiver_euw> U rarely see good lb games in pro and soloq
[2023-01-08 22:48:18] <!%Deceiver_euw> But when they happen shes insanely good in them
[2023-01-08 22:48:28] <%Manafy10> makes sense yeah

[2023-01-08 22:50:10] <!%Deceiver_euw> When you have like a funny nami or yuumi
[2023-01-08 22:50:23] <!%Deceiver_euw> And whole team ad
[2023-01-08 22:50:24] <%Manafy10> Deadge lb nami
[2023-01-08 22:50:51] <!%Deceiver_euw> And enemy has some dogshit midlaner like xerath or qiyana etc
[2023-01-08 22:51:06] <!%Deceiver_euw> And other champs that rly cant do anything to her
[2023-01-08 22:51:15] <!%Deceiver_euw> In fights
[2023-01-08 22:51:22] <%Manafy10> FeelsBadMan time to expand champion pool tomi
[2023-01-08 22:51:27] <!%Deceiver_euw> Lile she just does funny W and bursts someone no counterplay
[2023-01-08 22:51:30] <!%Deceiver_euw> Boom objective gone
[2023-01-08 22:51:44] <%Manafy10> yeah and thats hwy ppl hate lb OMEGALUL
[2023-01-08 22:51:48] <!%Deceiver_euw> No point if u arent good at them
[2023-01-08 22:52:06] <!%Deceiver_euw> Im tryna get rly good at 2-3 champs FeelsOkayMan
[2023-01-08 22:52:12] <!%Deceiver_euw> And ive been playing them for a long time
[2023-01-08 22:52:17] <%Manafy10> yeah makes sense
[2023-01-08 22:52:26] <%Manafy10> FeelsBadMan just sucks to get toplane so often
[2023-01-08 22:52:55] <!%Deceiver_euw> Maybe it fixes in gm+ if i climb
[2023-01-08 22:53:09] <!%Deceiver_euw> Or maybe theres gonna be more motivated pyschos that wanna main top
[2023-01-08 22:53:18] <%Manafy10> hopefully
[2023-01-08 22:53:20] <!%Deceiver_euw> U saw njemeshis got top like 4 5 games in a row
[2023-01-08 22:53:23] <!%Deceiver_euw> RIOT
[2023-01-08 22:53:27] <%Manafy10> :) fun
[2023-01-08 22:53:31] <%Manafy10> and top isnt even weak rn
[2023-01-08 22:53:35] <%Manafy10> or like top champs arent weak
[2023-01-08 22:54:05] <@^Nightbot> Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/c/Nemesis_lol/videos
[2023-01-08 22:55:43] <!%Deceiver_euw> Top is so much more skill expressive than mid nowdays imo
[2023-01-08 22:55:51] <!%Deceiver_euw> So hard to do anything to your opponent mid
[2023-01-08 22:56:03] <%Manafy10> yeah
[2023-01-08 22:56:05] <@^Nightbot> Join my discord: https://discord.com/invite/lolnemesis
[2023-01-08 22:56:06] <!%Deceiver_euw> No matter if ur better
[2023-01-08 22:56:09] <%Manafy10> but it also makes playing top horrible
[2023-01-08 22:56:24] <!%Deceiver_euw> Well if youre bad and dont play meta yes
[2023-01-08 22:56:24] <%Manafy10> cuz you cant play if enemy is actually good and you either get jgl ganked or make 1 misstake
[2023-01-08 22:56:25] <!%Deceiver_euw> Hehe
[2023-01-08 22:56:58] <k0l3raba> amumu watching netflix jgl diff Aware
[2023-01-08 22:57:10] <!%Deceiver_euw> Ahahaha
[2023-01-08 22:57:16] <!%Deceiver_euw> I saw the vod that was funny
[2023-01-08 22:57:20] <!%Deceiver_euw> Hoe muxh braindmg his team had
[2023-01-08 22:57:49] <k0l3raba> I don't get it why do people type so much
[2023-01-08 22:57:51] <k0l3raba> what's the point
[2023-01-08 22:57:58] <!%Deceiver_euw> Atleast u can go 0 6 in toplane and feel like you didnt even di anything wrong
[2023-01-08 22:58:05] <!%Deceiver_euw> In mid if u go 0 6 u have candy prob
[2023-01-08 22:58:16] <%Manafy10> yeah
[2023-01-08 22:58:32] <!%Deceiver_euw> Thats why i analyse the racism lvl of the lobby in champ select and game start
[2023-01-08 22:58:37] <!%Deceiver_euw> And decide most games to mute all 4
[2023-01-08 22:58:50] <!%Deceiver_euw> U can always guess whos gonna type a lot
[2023-01-08 22:59:01] <!%Deceiver_euw> By champ or opgg or name
[2023-01-08 22:59:25] <!%Deceiver_euw> When is my unban man
