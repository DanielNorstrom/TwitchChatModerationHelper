[2023-01-07 13:03:08] <@%^StreamElements> 1* (high priority) > 3* (Death prevention + 1* buff. Note if you have high Tian or invested in Tian get 3* Fen) > 5* (whale star and added dmg) > 6* (30% crit rate permanent on Fenrir and 5s when switched). Her matrices are really good if you can get them. If F2P pick between her or spearboi.

[2023-01-07 15:52:42] <%euphrasiaa_a> !fenrirpath
[2023-01-07 15:52:42] <@%^StreamElements> 1* (high priority) > 3* (Death prevention + 1* buff. Note if you have high Tian or invested in Tian get 3* Fen) > 5* (whale star and added dmg) > 6* (30% crit rate permanent on Fenrir and 5s when switched). Her matrices are really good if you can get them. If F2P pick between her or spearboi.
