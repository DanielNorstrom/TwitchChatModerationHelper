[2022-12-22 06:17:47] <%zeromatter21> Chris Pratt is like Bruce Willis where 90% of movies hes in are just generic action shlock
[2022-12-22 06:17:54] <Winter404> I feel like saying he was trying to do a mario voice is a very charitable interpretation
[2022-12-22 06:17:59] <%newtonia09> if there is no chris pratt fan, it is because I am dead

[2022-12-22 06:56:26] <thatstringfellow> Logically yes it was necessary. Ethically it was fucked up. I think that's where the conflict of the genophage comes from

[2022-12-22 07:04:04] <!%GinjiVitis> the theme that the humble danny divito type (smol hairy boys) can do good thing if given many breakfast

[2022-12-22 07:04:30] <!%Prof_PavloVT> but one thing I like is that people who seek power will be their own downfall, but that's more of a moral thing than a a factual thing.
[2022-12-22 07:04:58] <%LeonidasUmbra> so that's why the 2nd season was pretty meh
[2022-12-22 07:05:00] <%newtonia09> @xMrPhilGoodx I agree! its because bioware was forced to reuse all of the assets because EA treated the game as a DLC and thus gave it a DLC development time
[2022-12-22 07:05:01] <%BotFodder> Good TV writers do exist, but nobody majors in Screenwriting without a literary background LUL
[2022-12-22 07:05:04] <!%Prof_PavloVT> So the theme was kind of "Get people in power who don't want to be in power and things just work", which isn't really *good*, but yeah.  He was a Catholic and we have different worldviews.

I'd say the characters in DA:2 Are a little better but the entire writing for Origins is fantastic... it hits you hard in the emotions right from the start. Especially with the City Elf origin, though my favorite is probably the noble dwarf.

[2022-12-22 07:16:03] <%LoremasterofSotek> Warhammer lore is lovely, but you have to approach it with the understanding that it was created by a community of writers, game designers, and communities that has evolved over the last 40 years. So it's essentially a GIANT mess but that's half the fun us digging and finding all the best parts!

[2022-12-22 07:24:12] <%LoremasterofSotek> @extrafuzzy it's decent! Darktide has a lot of growing to do and the missions are a bit too repetitive for my liking. But the main gameplay is excellent and the aesthetic of the game was very well done

[2022-12-22 07:26:37] <%LoremasterofSotek> Space Marines are so boring when you can choose delightful Tyranids instead! An endless bug-lizard hybrid race that consumes all things and can actively evolve itself at the drop of a hat to combat all threats? A glorious Hive Mind that seeks to absorb all into itself so we can ascend to be part of the one true lifeform? Now THAT'S a good sci-fi race

[2022-12-22 07:27:58] <%BotFodder> Tyrannids have cool designs. Very HR Giger
[2022-12-22 07:27:59] <%LoremasterofSotek> @extrafuzzy Darktide is good to strat with, yes. I think Vermintide 2 is a much better overall experience but obviously there's a TON going on it in whereas Darktide is relatively simple atm
[2022-12-22 07:28:01] <thatstringfellow> I like the genestealer cults. Very eldritch concept
[2022-12-22 07:28:05] <%zeromatter21> Nu-crons are waaaay better than primaris marines. But I'm not a huge hater even if the lore sucks. @RomeoEchoDelta
[2022-12-22 07:28:08] <%SpooksyVT> We were making a video game yeah!
[2022-12-22 07:28:25] <!%$Nyanomancer> Space Marines are effectively immortal.
[2022-12-22 07:28:28] <!%7192_ch> they can serve for a very long time, even going as far as to being implanted in giant robot tombs
[2022-12-22 07:28:41] <rbjb988> wait is this your first playthrough of the mass effect trilogy?
[2022-12-22 07:28:43] <%ArcReaper_21> @LoremasterofSotek I have a soft spot for me space Egyptian zombies the Necrons. That notably seeks to seal of the Warp from the real space (and sorta save the universe from Choas in turn).
[2022-12-22 07:28:44] <%newtonia09> Oh! I realized something!  TIM's chair is modelled after the chairs  roman emperor's use

[2022-12-22 07:28:52] <+xMrPhilGoodx> See... this is exactly how I feel about Jack >.> Jack is is my go to favorite romance xD Clearly I have a thing for crazy chicks. Her character has so much depth that you miss out though if you don't romance her. Also she gives you a tattoo in 3 so that "She can find your corpse under all the reaper corpses." xD
[2022-12-22 07:29:04] <%RomeoEchoDelta> The oldest regular Space Marine is over 1000 years old and is a vampire.

[2022-12-22 07:29:53] <@%Extrafuzzy> Hey Grimmi, I got this sent to me https://www.youtube.com/@AVoxintheVoid - Its the warhammer voice thing.
[2022-12-22 07:29:59] <thatstringfellow> Dreadnoughts are ancient space marines stuck inside a mech. It's sad when one dies because they don't write things down. So when a Dreadnought dies a piece of history dies with them
[2022-12-22 07:30:09] <!%voltchuckleflumpkinsbunny> Theres appariently a leader that's away just because hes asleep

[2022-12-22 07:30:28] <%newtonia09> long story short, warhammer lore is immense, its best to learn about it on your own accord
[2022-12-22 07:30:37] <!%7192_ch> wait are there two blood-related space marines
[2022-12-22 07:30:40] <rbjb988> *blows up*
[2022-12-22 07:30:45] <%RomeoEchoDelta> The Blood Ravens also steal everything.

[2022-12-22 07:30:49] <%LoremasterofSotek> Haha, I can give you a presentation on Warhammer Lore if you'd ever like Grimmi! I'll theme it to your tastes as well so it's not just confusing garble of constant nonsense
[2022-12-22 07:31:00] <%RomeoEchoDelta> @7192_ch There are many blood related marine chapters.
[2022-12-22 07:31:05] <%zeromatter21> Yes brothers are sometimes recruited at the same time

[2022-12-22 07:32:04] <%BotFodder> @grimmivt  The best way to start WH lore is to pretend you're a prospective war gamer, pick your single most favorite faction, and read their fluff! Otherwise it's overwhelming.

[2022-12-22 07:37:32] <%LoremasterofSotek> @arcreaper_21 Ah, you would probably be quite interested in King Phar or Queen Khalida of Lybaras of the Tomb Kings then! They have heavy rivalry/vengeance themes to their tales. King Phar tends to be a bit more on the humorous side while Khalida has an number of massive showdowns with Neferata, the First Vampire!

[2022-12-22 07:38:03] <%RomeoEchoDelta> Grimmi if you want a Space Marine group that tickles your "always struggling" itch, look up the Lamentors. They don't got much but what they do got is good.

[2022-12-22 08:34:36] <%PlushMines> @newtonia09 Based, honestly
[2022-12-22 08:34:49] <Darkicus> They do however vomit
[2022-12-22 08:34:54] <AirFryerBuyOneGetOneFree> The devs want to add trans dwarves, but after 20 years of coding they need to figure out how that will interact with the 100s of systems they already have. They want to "do it right".
[2022-12-22 08:34:59] <PopatoGames> can't believe you're sad there's no poop management
[2022-12-22 08:35:05] <%BotFodder> For many, many years it had only ASCII graphics. PS1 is breathtaking compared to it.
[2022-12-22 08:35:05] <%MintCastella> until three weeks ago it literally h ad No Graphics but now it has 2d sprites/mouse controls
[2022-12-22 08:35:20] <%mr_frick12> That fear did not stop cult of the lamb. bosheepEvil

[2022-12-22 08:35:37] <%RomeoEchoDelta> The old version was so dated it could only use a single core of your CPU.
[2022-12-22 08:35:39] <%AlwaysArmoured> it was ascii before
[2022-12-22 08:35:39] <AirFryerBuyOneGetOneFree> its was ascii, all text based graphics
[2022-12-22 08:35:40] <%+ectoplasmnudes> well, you could get skins for it
[2022-12-22 08:35:40] <beehe> I mean I ended up with a fortress full of bards. Most starved and then I learned how to remove people that wont leave or work.
[2022-12-22 08:35:40] <%ErraticPillow> it was
[2022-12-22 08:35:41] <%+ghosthost12> it also has a legends mode where it will generate over 200 years of history that you can peruse, with heros and monsters and artifacts, that you have a chance of finding in your game!
[2022-12-22 08:35:41] <Starfyre687> It was completely ASCII based
[2022-12-22 08:35:43] <%MintCastella> theyve been working on it constantly for 17 years.
[2022-12-22 08:35:43] <+ChunkBeefthrust> Yeah

[2022-12-22 08:36:15] <%RomeoEchoDelta> Yeah, I played it in middle school and I'm borderline dirt.
[2022-12-22 08:36:25] <%+ectoplasmnudes> this release was also cuz they hired someoen who made one of their most popular mods right?
[2022-12-22 08:36:28] <%ErraticPillow> hey grundle hows it goin

[2022-12-22 08:36:40] <AirFryerBuyOneGetOneFree> A LOT of games are a direct result of Dwarf Fortress
[2022-12-22 08:36:42] <%$TravisBroski> Woah Mass Effect 2
[2022-12-22 08:36:51] <%Robbaz_Korgi> this sounds like a caves of quod type of game grimmi14Bigeyes

[2022-12-22 08:36:55] <+woofycakes> i've heard about the game my whole internet life but never looked at it until mint's stream
[2022-12-22 08:36:56] <%ErraticPillow> the games calculations can sometimes hit your cpu really hard
[2022-12-22 08:36:58] <%$TravisBroski> I know nothing of the series' story lol
[2022-12-22 08:36:58] <RomeoEchoDelta> It was on a single core
[2022-12-22 08:37:08] <@%AunAprendo> RIP Cubeworld. grimmi14OHNO
[2022-12-22 08:37:15] <%MintCastella> the big thing about it is that its fantastic at generating stories. if you like playing a game that will give you stories to tell after, its the absolute best ati t
[2022-12-22 08:37:16] <Alesh_the_Lich> Today I heard it used to have a bug with cats dying in taverns because they'd roll around the alcohol covered floors, lick themselves clean, and eventually die of alcohol poisoning
[2022-12-22 08:37:16] <Starfyre687> Rimworld traces a pretty straight line from Dwarf Fortress
[2022-12-22 08:37:28] <DrHidaka> also it's not a DOS game but the original version uses ASCII graphics purely to save processing power. Dwarf Fortress is one of the games inducted into the Smithsonian
[2022-12-22 08:37:31] VIEWERS: 352
[2022-12-22 08:37:35] <%ErraticPillow> yea the game calculates alot of stuff every frame, just like math and stuff
[2022-12-22 08:37:44] <battlerek> its not goncharov
[2022-12-22 08:37:44] <Wockstar> Yeah it sounds like a joke game from a cartoon
[2022-12-22 08:37:46] <+NeoRussia> it's not just a game, it's THE game
[2022-12-22 08:37:50] <+woofycakes> dwarf fortress (idea) (concept)
[2022-12-22 08:37:54] <%Robbaz_Korgi> Go Pee already! grimmi14Angy
[2022-12-22 08:37:59] <AirFryerBuyOneGetOneFree> Like my dwarf civilization has been at war with the goblins for years now, as a result all of the dwarves that enter my fort have a lot of military experience
[2022-12-22 08:38:02] <%ErraticPillow> dwarf fortres story rivals ai generated storys
[2022-12-22 08:38:20] <beehe> Also rangom monsters from the deep (possibly lovecraftian or D&D monstrosities)
[2022-12-22 08:38:43] <!%GinjiVitis> J. R. R. Tolkien's literal dying words was "dwarves dont poop"
[2022-12-22 08:38:45] <Alesh_the_Lich> Yeah the game is crazy detailed
[2022-12-22 08:38:49] <%Robbaz_Korgi> grimmi14Laughingman the pin
[2022-12-22 08:38:52] <%ErraticPillow> yea that actualy caused alot of cpu issues cuz you would have 60 cats all dying and your cpu would calculate it all
[2022-12-22 08:38:52] <Alesh_the_Lich> In the best/worst ways
[2022-12-22 08:38:55] <AirFryerBuyOneGetOneFree> Every lick was accidentally a full mug of dwarven super hard alcohol
[2022-12-22 08:39:03] <%RomeoEchoDelta> It's absurdly complex and fun.
[2022-12-22 08:39:05] <battlerek> Oh good choices
[2022-12-22 08:39:11] <+Natsume_Mai> Ashley actually gets better

[2022-12-22 08:39:19] <!%voltchuckleflumpkinsbunny> The save editor was to make sure Ashley was dead, everything else was just a byproduct

[2022-12-22 08:46:01] <DrHidaka> in DF, Carp used to be regarded as incredibly deadly beasts, because exercising builds muscle, and carp are ALWAYS SWIMMING. they balanced it out later
