[2022-12-11 06:28:32] <%SwitchOfChaos> @memeboi335 well I have a job and I'm taking two college classes so most of my prep time for the week is on the weekend. Usually late night or early morning since I work in the afternoon. Next semester will be worse since it'll be full credit hours instead of the 6 I'm at
