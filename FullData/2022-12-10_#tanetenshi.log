[2022-12-10 10:21:22] <DoubleLightning> There was an incident were Asriel and The First Human made a pie for Asgore but confused "cups of butter and flour" for "buttercup flowers" and got Asgore very sick. Although Toriel was extremely worried, Asgore was not angry in the slightest and was rather proud that they went through the effort to make him something. THAT'S how much of a softie Asgore is... ttalgiCry

[2022-12-10 10:41:15] <WitherBlaster> Genocide ending permanently taints your game, and ruins any future true pacifist endings. Unless you edit the game's files directly, of course.

[2022-12-10 10:41:52] <%$durpypig17> iirc you have to kill EVERYTHING like constantly go around each area to kill everything there
