She differs in that she can summon several skeletons or even an enemy wearing the same armor as the former boss of the Undead Crypt, Velstadt to assist her in at

Somehow, Elana survived the siege, and became furious and vengeful for her city's destruction and possibly her husband's death. She took on her true form and now accompanies Sinh.

[2023-01-05 16:36:59] <%+unagiro> @dinossindgeil he is weak to magic and dark if you have resin
[2023-01-05 16:37:02] <%camf3> This boss fight SL1 is incredibly difficult to be fair
[2023-01-05 16:37:04] <crazi3kitt3n> maybe attack butt?
[2023-01-05 16:37:06] <%NahsTrodamus> you can also cut off his tail, it wont drop an item, but it will increase his flying attacks Hmmm
[2023-01-05 16:37:07] <yougotcheckmated> I really dislike big monster bosses in the souls games
[2023-01-05 16:37:09] <atrophia69> You took a lot of health off in that 1 hit
[2023-01-05 16:37:14] <Any_SN> @T0BSTA Let's make a whole DLC based upon it

[2023-01-05 16:37:17] <%Gjerlaugsen> @dinossindgeil if u stay mid-range away from him he usally uses the breath attack, and then u can damage him
[2023-01-05 16:37:20] <$NorcastZ> and this is probably the easiest dlc monkaW

[2023-01-05 17:01:09] <Breadcrumbs85> Yeah my thoughts are that they had a choice. Copy DS1 and be called cowards. Or be brave and try to evolve the gameplay. So I respect their effort to try and move things forward. I just think they were smoking crack when they made some of the choices they made :P
[2023-01-05 17:01:09] <azguest> what is about ring which make you invisible while you roll. Will it give your frames of invisibility?

[2023-01-05 17:01:39] <hemiak> In a way it‚Äôs great because they tried a bunch of new stuff. Some of it worked and some of it absolutely doesn‚Äôt and you can tell they paid attention to that in the later games.

[2023-01-05 17:52:50] <Any_SN> RTSR doesn't boost spells
[2023-01-05 17:53:03] <%foxxx0> you need to spend 16k souls at the armor merchant. reload the area and then talk to him again while having 0 souls. then you will get the transparent aurous set which is insanely good. @dinossindgeil
[2023-01-05 17:53:03] <+lastangelcall> maybe lure them with the crossbow and then use pyro
[2023-01-05 17:53:04] <%Mabuschka> i think you can kill the or pull the little one with the crossbow before aggroing the big guy

[2023-01-05 17:55:08] <%+alexcon18> you want to be near him when he does that charge, you can then rol into him and not get hit
[2023-01-05 17:55:11] <ciwsiw> just a rip off of sif with bad status effects
[2023-01-05 17:55:13] <%ReyneDelay> seems like outside of that attack you've almost got it

[2023-01-05 17:55:47] <%+alexcon18> roll into him if you are close to him
