[2023-01-10 13:59:49] <FloridaBummish> i like Andrew Garfield's one. follows the commics well

[2023-01-10 13:59:59] <mikesubzero43> yea with Toby lol
[2023-01-10 14:00:03] <lowmana_> Andrew Garfield - best spiderman
[2023-01-10 14:00:04] <%+SimpleOblivion> Yeah, SM3 was so cringe. uhsKEKW
[2023-01-10 14:00:08] <ouistipouff> tbh Mcguire was a good Peter Parker, but Garfield was a good Spiderman, but Holland has both going on

[2023-01-10 14:00:14] <KavSKG> spiderman 2 with tobey was the best
[2023-01-10 14:00:15] <%+Ericj20> I hope he's in it long enough to have the MCU bring in Mile Morales, that would be a good story
[2023-01-10 14:00:17] <flash77s> Tom Holland is the best Spider-Man so far for me and Miles is my second favorite Spider-Man and Andrew Garfield, third favorite, Spider-Man Tobey, Maguire fourth favorite Spider-Man Tobey Maguire could’ve done better in Spider-Man thoughts?
[2023-01-10 14:00:17] <%+EmrysorMerlin> I do like the song from spiderman 3
[2023-01-10 14:00:19] <%+Borris2811> i hope Andrew Garfield gets a third movie tho
[2023-01-10 14:00:20] <lowmana_> Toby Mcguire best Peter Parker

[2023-01-10 14:05:44] <+Tremz87> Superman and Aquaman are the only 2 I like and its for the actors
[2023-01-10 14:05:47] <%+NarcisDuran> dc movies needs to go more darker as there dc animated ones
[2023-01-10 14:05:47] <Tickktack> Meh, i like the movies theyre entertaining but the "DC Cinematic Universe"  hasn't really pulled me in fully.  The movies are okay and fun to watch but im not as invested as the MCU.
[2023-01-10 14:05:47] <%+Borris2811> batman is boring for me oop
[2023-01-10 14:05:47] <neutr0n_x> Nolan trilogy was diamond gwiseW

[2023-01-10 14:06:30] <%+modaaal> not superman not the witcher Sadge
[2023-01-10 14:06:31] <Karvar1> I would like to see some of the batman comics made into movies, just to see what they would be like.
[2023-01-10 14:06:31] <neutr0n_x> cavil was a great superman
[2023-01-10 14:06:33] <%Forser> James Gunn will replace most of them for sure
[2023-01-10 14:06:33] <%WellyWonkaDonka> no they have dumped all of them
[2023-01-10 14:06:34] <downtownTHEEgallant> Battinson
[2023-01-10 14:06:34] <Tickktack> The power level discrepancies just dont seem to transfer well to movie universe.
[2023-01-10 14:06:39] <mikesubzero43> Henry is coming back for man of steel 2

[2023-01-10 14:06:43] <asterisk0o> There’s a new Batman
[2023-01-10 14:06:44] <epiloguesound> The Tim Burton Batman is my favorite
[2023-01-10 14:06:47] <%StarAnjeLyn> He makes a good Noir Batman, I think.
[2023-01-10 14:06:51] <%+awt_pooters> College Humor batman best batman
[2023-01-10 14:06:52] <+lostintought> henry is doing man of steel 2

[2023-01-10 14:07:01] <+Signothorn> @epiloguesound Same, I like Michael Keaton
[2023-01-10 14:07:03] <+nestorx85> Michael Keaton was tim burton batman right?
[2023-01-10 14:07:04] <%drako5411> no he was let go
[2023-01-10 14:07:05] <downtownTHEEgallant> he did better than I anticipated. but i dig batfleck
[2023-01-10 14:07:05] <%+SimpleOblivion> Ben was also supposed to direct one of the movies too and they took that from him too.
[2023-01-10 14:07:11] <$MelMaybe> I thought Christian bale was a good Batman
[2023-01-10 14:07:11] <%WellyWonkaDonka> Gunn  has ditched all the cast apart from the flash guy
[2023-01-10 14:07:14] <%drako5411> he is now going to do a warhammer 40k movie
[2023-01-10 14:07:18] <%twisty_mc> @uhSnow we could have had a Nic Cage superman at one point. missed chances sadKEK
[2023-01-10 14:07:19] <+harvscream> The Dark Knight with Heath Ledger and Christian Bale is one of my favorite movies ever
[2023-01-10 14:07:23] <+lostintought> he said that after the witcher 3 he wil come back to being superman
[2023-01-10 14:07:24] <%+MobiusF117> George Clooney is the best Batman
[2023-01-10 14:07:25] <%Rayvendreamer> @uhSnow Henry is doing Warhammer
[2023-01-10 14:07:27] <%+Paralyzor> i thought that one was interesting story wise
[2023-01-10 14:07:28] <downtownTHEEgallant> Pattinson did better than I anticipated*
[2023-01-10 14:07:29] <%+apems> Couldnt even watch the Robert Patterson Batman movie the audio was so bad in that movie its was rubbish
[2023-01-10 14:07:29] <BoerseunMG> @WellyWonkaDonka wonder why xD
[2023-01-10 14:07:30] <mikesubzero43> I thought he did cuz he also shows up at the end of black Adam as superman
[2023-01-10 14:07:32] <%xGraveyard_Roosterx> There's actually a lawsuit about to happen because the studio didn't fulfil contracts for Superman, Wonder Woman, and Batman
[2023-01-10 14:07:33] <%slapperofbutts> i've been watching youtubs on 40k universe, im stuper stoked to see what henry comes up with
[2023-01-10 14:07:34] <%StarAnjeLyn> I prefer a more story driven batman, btw.
[2023-01-10 14:07:35] <neutr0n_x> cavil gonna do some warhammer 40k, and iam excited AF

[2023-01-10 14:07:48] <%joevue_> christian bale
[2023-01-10 14:07:48] <%BigBadBooty2> Bale was an epic batman
[2023-01-10 14:07:48] <+Zendero89> @MobiusF117 you mean batnips?
[2023-01-10 14:07:48] <%slapperofbutts> bale is legit
[2023-01-10 14:07:49] <ArenaKrusher> affleck was ok, pattison was meh, Bale was great imo
[2023-01-10 14:07:49] <%+robertooob> agreed
[2023-01-10 14:07:52] <downtownTHEEgallant> Batnips LUL
[2023-01-10 14:07:54] <%Apitoxin11> I like Pattinson's on it's own. I wouldn't want him as the franchise though
[2023-01-10 14:07:55] <+juanito614> he did a great job

[2023-01-10 14:07:56] <+SpellRED> Best batman for me
[2023-01-10 14:07:58] <%Forser> Yeah, Henry left to do Superman 2 but they aren't doing it so Henry went to do Warhammer
[2023-01-10 14:08:00] <%slapperofbutts> bale even does voice acting that is nuts
[2023-01-10 14:08:04] <+Signothorn> Val Kilmer was the worst
[2023-01-10 14:08:06] <$MelMaybe> @uhsnow what about mi
[2023-01-10 14:08:07] <%WellyWonkaDonka> all 3 of Nolans batmans are far better than the other super hero stuff
[2023-01-10 14:08:13] <%StarAnjeLyn> It was a very FULL story. The movie tried to do to much.
[2023-01-10 14:08:16] <%Irish_GT> For me I don't think Bale's Batman will be topped
[2023-01-10 14:08:17] <ryleyyg> I never got into dc tbh
[2023-01-10 14:08:17] <+freyguy34> the pattenson was more of a noir
[2023-01-10 14:08:18] <Tickktack> I think the DC universe struggles because of this conversation right here.  There have been SOOO many reboots that viewers are more invested in their favorite version, or actor, playing the character.
[2023-01-10 14:08:18] <+ethameta> george clooney takes it though

[2023-01-10 14:08:21] <%+Leviwest> @uhSnow thing about batman is 2 versions you got dark comic version and silly comical style comic versions.. Dark is better
[2023-01-10 14:08:26] <+griilo> @uhSnow Henry is now working on a warhammer series, and the funniest thing is they kept the actor who plays flash even after the drama around him
[2023-01-10 14:08:31] <colacubes1> I think my favourites are the old films because they are light hearted
[2023-01-10 14:08:31] <epiloguesound> Heath Ledger was the best thing about the Nolan ones

[2023-01-10 14:08:46] <%+NarcisDuran> @uhSnow actors for wonder woman and flash but rest ar gone probably but rumours go mamoa will play lobo in future

[2023-01-10 16:11:34] <+natanatanata> It’s a lot of walking so definitely 3 for universal
[2023-01-10 16:11:37] <Jaycutes> 2 to enjoy everything. you can get both parks in Universal in one but maybe not all the rides becuase of wait times
[2023-01-10 16:11:37] <%InquisitorDex> Leicester square right next to kings cross LOL
[2023-01-10 16:11:47] <$MiniBerger_> THAT is the best way to go to Harry potter, you got to do it on the train
[2023-01-10 16:11:48] <+paige_plays_games> Depends on how many rides you go on but I do universal and islands of adv in one day. I also prefer Disney tho.
[2023-01-10 16:11:54] <Suhlurpy> you may want to get both parks at once for the parks because you'll be able to go between both Harry Potter locations in each park

[2023-01-10 16:16:37] <%InquisitorDex> Universal use all the comic versions of Marvel, Disney is the Cinematic universe
[2023-01-10 16:16:37] <%Uf0s8mycat> probably like 200 a ticket per day
[2023-01-10 16:16:39] <+ParadoxAmunet> Please No Jurassic Parking

[2023-01-10 16:16:48] <+CuBanMumzy> avoid goin in July - September, way to hot

[2023-01-10 16:17:05] <%+Chaoski> $282
[2023-01-10 16:17:07] <%Stealthkillah122> its florida with megatron that roasts people right ?
[2023-01-10 16:17:07] <$MiniBerger_> @uhSnow the benefit to staying on the site is your hotel keycard is your ticket in, and you can take a boat to the parks. No car needed etc.
[2023-01-10 16:17:12] <%+Chaoski> per person
[2023-01-10 16:17:15] <+ParadoxAmunet> Better to stay on grounds than off grounds
[2023-01-10 16:17:15] <dir7y_h4rry> spend some time at Margaritaville
[2023-01-10 16:17:17] <%$LuckyPaddy> @Runc0rn Approved! Sussy

[2023-01-10 16:17:19] <%kirkis123> we went on thursday and firday but got tickets for monday because it was cheaper but you get the whole week to go two days
[2023-01-10 16:17:19] <%+jonondiscord> So much better
[2023-01-10 16:17:20] <+StageName> @Doodlebug93 yeah I got a vip pass for the park
[2023-01-10 16:17:20] <N1ne7y> @uhSnow if you book through Virgin you get park tickets free
[2023-01-10 16:17:20] <@%AfricanSnowball> gotta get the fast pass
[2023-01-10 16:17:21] <Jaycutes> @Jessixa its becuase its not Avengers Campus, they only have rights to the older DC/Marvel comics
[2023-01-10 16:17:28] <@%Jessixa> I know :D
[2023-01-10 16:17:35] <%Doodlebug93> Shotz may be able to help you as well

[2023-01-10 16:17:41] <%+Lazyhead> Me and my SO did the VIP tour. It was so worth it.
[2023-01-10 16:17:43] <$MiniBerger_> It used to be that staying on site counted as you having the fast pass, but its been a long time
[2023-01-10 16:17:43] <Suhlurpy> You'll be waiting in line for a while if you don't get fast pass but its pretty steep
[2023-01-10 16:17:44] <%PoOdged> if you know anyone who lives there they can get you discounted tickets
[2023-01-10 16:17:44] <%Uf0s8mycat> is it really fast if everyone gets it? Kappa
[2023-01-10 16:17:47] <+buddy_green2021> fast pass is a MUST
[2023-01-10 16:17:49] <planocrusher> i stayed outside the park and thought it was awesome..had a house with a pool, grill..
[2023-01-10 16:17:57] <+rikmyr08> You can get free express passes if you stay on there premium hotels like the Hard Rock Hotel.
[2023-01-10 16:18:02] <%+JBarlak> @jaycutes they have rights for marvel characters east of Mississippi.  It’s sad since disney did try to get the rights back

[2023-01-10 16:21:49] <weamans> you are doing epcot wrong
[2023-01-10 16:21:49] <+boarderr11> Drink around the world is about it
[2023-01-10 16:21:54] <@%Jessixa> Universal is HUGE
[2023-01-10 16:21:54] <%+jonondiscord> Drink around the world baby

[2023-01-10 16:21:56] <%+Comis19> Epcot is a day if you like food. Also they have no guardian of galaxy ride
[2023-01-10 16:21:58] <%+Rellies> @xSevilx I unfortunately have not been there in 15 years so I am very much overdue lol
[2023-01-10 16:21:58] <weamans> you drink around the world
[2023-01-10 16:22:01] <+senapi93> The appreciation i have for Epcot is so much more compared to when i was a kid.
[2023-01-10 16:22:01] <%+Nicole> I found it disappointing
[2023-01-10 16:22:01] <+paige_plays_games> @uhsnow three for Disney isnt wrong. Animal kingdom is only good for avatar and Hollywood studios for galaxy’s edge. One for Epcot, one for magic kingdom.
[2023-01-10 16:22:06] <%+Saichen> Cedar Point is ok, i'm a local to there, if you like rollercoasters its good. its closed for the winter tho.

[2023-01-10 16:28:24] <@%Jessixa> @N1ne7y Otherwise if you're already expecting to pay a bunch, then go ahead and splurge and stay in a Universal hotel! You get some perks of doing that from the park and it's a lot easier.
