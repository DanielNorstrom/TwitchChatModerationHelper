[2023-01-02 21:51:23] <Game_Mations> the only geo team I have would be noelle, itto, gorou, and xiangling.
[2023-01-02 21:51:25] <%pupplezz> Geo only really good mono, which sucks some times
[2023-01-02 21:51:26] <squidtoldme> and this person is acting like you are offending their entire bloodline by not having the same opinion
[2023-01-02 21:51:27] <KeviiAG> but it's alright

[2023-01-02 21:53:02] <in_a_hurri> geo has so many reactions that would make sense like erosion with hydro and geo but hyv hates gei

[2023-01-02 21:53:09] <%pupplezz> Objectively it is the worst, not saying it’s horrible but that’s just saying that it’s kind of limited with buffs and reactions that other elements can usually have
[2023-01-02 21:53:11] <cotton_candy0204> sounds like a lot of BS to me
[2023-01-02 21:53:13] <LilArtsyAlice> like is this person married to geo like that lerson is defending it so hard WutFace
[2023-01-02 21:53:17] <%comfycafes> zhongli has very high burst damage, but most people aren't gonna build him as burst dps anyways so lol

[2023-01-02 21:56:10] <yuriokyizu_> THEYRE JUST SO BAD
[2023-01-02 21:56:12] <%$hformal> Hai sadist. What are you up to?
[2023-01-02 21:56:16] <MigueC21> actual arguments
[2023-01-02 21:56:25] <yuriokyizu_> REAL ARGUMENTS
[2023-01-02 21:56:34] <squidtoldme> the first question you ask is "is 'the best element' subjective?"
[2023-01-02 21:56:40] <%samsellsjams> i'm a geo shrimp zhongli albedo main with cons but even myself know geo is bad OMEGALUL
[2023-01-02 21:56:47] <yuriokyizu_> GENSHIN IS A OPEN WORLD GAME 😭😭 WHERE IS THE SKILL ISSUE THERE
[2023-01-02 21:56:56] <LilArtsyAlice> @yuriokyizu_  frr
[2023-01-02 21:57:01] <Kitty49> Best element you've experienced too
[2023-01-02 21:57:04] <ReexIKenny> like objectively geo is far from being meta atm
[2023-01-02 21:57:11] <ReexIKenny> so it falls behind
[2023-01-02 21:57:14] <cotton_candy0204> It's mostly how they composed their argument in a way that pushed those who made valid arguments into "um actually thats a you problem I just wont eloborate on why cause even idk"
[2023-01-02 21:57:17] <voidarkangels> hello sadist! how are you
[2023-01-02 21:57:21] <in_a_hurri> erosion, rooted, and sandstorm would be amazing reactions
[2023-01-02 21:57:23] <MigueC21> Geo, best for insta arguments
[2023-01-02 21:57:32] <mistyvk> geo characters are fun for me at least
[2023-01-02 21:57:36] <raged_dino> cryo cuz freeze stall and melt
[2023-01-02 21:57:51] <squidtoldme> @cotton_candy0204 fr
[2023-01-02 21:57:55] <yuriokyizu_> AND DO ACTUAL RESEARCH
[2023-01-02 21:57:56] <LilArtsyAlice> i think every elenent has their goods and bads , right? TPFufun
[2023-01-02 21:57:58] <%samsellsjams> nah don't
[2023-01-02 21:58:02] <MigueC21> nah
[2023-01-02 21:58:03] <chickenricesoup> that’s sounds like a narcissist
[2023-01-02 21:58:09] VIEWERS: 145
[2023-01-02 21:58:13] <%Noejhl> geo is the most comfy to play imo def scaling and lots of shields make u basicly immortal
[2023-01-02 21:58:15] <candyxkxc> ever bored? just start a fight about "best element" you'll have fun seeing people argue
[2023-01-02 21:58:15] <%VivaLaFxxkU> pyro cuz dmg go brr
[2023-01-02 21:58:17] <MigueC21> You don't reply, i will NODDERS
[2023-01-02 21:58:20] <%pupplezz> I would like to see their sources- APA cited please
[2023-01-02 21:58:22] <mistyvk> @Noejhl yeah
[2023-01-02 21:58:29] <squidtoldme> they acted like you said "never play geo" smh
[2023-01-02 21:58:45] <MigueC21> ok itto does 100k with no reactions, respect tbh
[2023-01-02 21:58:47] <MigueC21> agreeee
[2023-01-02 21:59:17] <ReexIKenny> my eula hits 1 mil no ractions and now?
[2023-01-02 21:59:20] <cotton_candy0204> Geo is just not currently composed in a way that's easy to use in game unless you really know what you're doing
[2023-01-02 21:59:23] <ReexIKenny> reactions*
[2023-01-02 21:59:24] <%ChaoticCheshire24> am back shiryPeek
[2023-01-02 21:59:28] <%Noejhl> u only dont like it because the carrys are claymore and theres no fancy reaktions komemoSad
[2023-01-02 21:59:31] <cotton_candy0204> like most people starting out see it as shield and nothing else
[2023-01-02 21:59:37] <squidtoldme> like i wanna see their sources
[2023-01-02 21:59:38] <chickenricesoup> my second main is geo and i have a full geo mono + bennett and for me they still do really good
[2023-01-02 21:59:43] <cotton_candy0204> which is okay but there is more
[2023-01-02 21:59:43] <chickenricesoup> i may not understand how but
[2023-01-02 21:59:52] <chickenricesoup> still gives me good numbers
[2023-01-02 21:59:55] <evencyman> remove zhongli and itto from geo
[2023-01-02 22:00:03] <YJGA> i like it because of the husbandos tbh
