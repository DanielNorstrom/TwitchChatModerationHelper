[2022-12-10 09:45:57] <%sadib100> i won a free copy of dragon quest treasures from square enix

[2022-12-10 09:46:34] <%Draggo__x3> not this one
[2022-12-10 09:46:34] <%$llamaking__> This item respawns so there's no chance we've already gotten it right? or at least no chance that's why we haven't found it

[2022-12-10 09:47:43] <HazareNae> with this luck, Sabrina is going to have a 122 speed Alakazham with STAB Psychic and 250+ SPA LUL
[2022-12-10 09:47:43] <%$llamaking__> It respawns though right? So even if you found it you still would've found it by now
[2022-12-10 09:47:49] <LightLunas> I thought that's how RNG manipulation in the speedrun and such was possible in the first place
[2022-12-10 09:47:50] <%Draggo__x3> It's gonna be a full heal
[2022-12-10 09:47:54] <JMKS4> CarlSmile

[2022-12-10 09:49:33] <%$llamaking__> TGH is the exception to all statistical probability

[2022-12-10 09:49:40] <@%+Taco_Champ> tgh_sr the SR stands for Seriously Rudeluck
[2022-12-10 09:49:40] <CynthiaKnight> have you tried looking under the truck for an item
[2022-12-10 09:49:40] <ocyc> damn
[2022-12-10 09:49:49] <%berniebeatsboxes> TGH's bad luck is proportionate to Dream's good luck
[2022-12-10 09:49:49] <therollingninja777> 80% is 50% for TGH
[2022-12-10 09:49:49] <PyroJakk> We might've already gotten it on the first way down...
[2022-12-10 09:49:51] <@%Duskplume> So, is 3935 the amount of Kaizo runs or the amount of times you've checked this 10%
[2022-12-10 09:50:10] <%sadib100> check the vod
[2022-12-10 09:50:12] <%Cerpin_> that "right?" is slightly concerning

[2022-12-10 09:50:18] <@%^Nightbot> tghThis RNG is bullshit
[2022-12-10 09:50:19] <kaizopolice> You would have hit it by now
[2022-12-10 09:50:20] <%$llamaking__> Don't the items down here respawn or am I insane
[2022-12-10 09:50:24] <LightLunas> even if you did, it would respawn
[2022-12-10 09:50:32] <victaghost> tactically burning the bad luck before sabrina
[2022-12-10 09:50:33] <@%+Taco_Champ> wouldnt it be funny if you werent in the right spot
[2022-12-10 09:50:46] <kaizopolice> ^
[2022-12-10 09:50:48] <%+sin_pyro> I tried looking up FireRed RNG manip and I just got fucking confused. Now I need more Madrinas to cure my headache.
[2022-12-10 09:50:51] <+maleblackfiora> maybe the way is not working out do it the old way 4Head
[2022-12-10 09:50:53] <%berniebeatsboxes> And we walked the extra 1500 steps too to reset it
[2022-12-10 09:50:59] <PyroJakk> Wait if it respawns, is it lllegal to get it again?
[2022-12-10 09:51:02] <ocyc> and we're certain reloading the save state is rerolling the item?
[2022-12-10 09:51:14] <%berniebeatsboxes> Im-jerr
[2022-12-10 09:51:23] <Katooie> ehm

[2022-12-10 09:51:27] <%firin_bot> yeah its a problem Houndoom gets turned out. Clip.
[2022-12-10 09:51:27] <therollingninja777> what if by getting this item means you'll used up all your luck and you'll never win ironmon
[2022-12-10 09:51:27] <Katooie> LUL
[2022-12-10 09:51:27] <JMKS4> So if they respawn can't you just get another considering it's all RNG anyway what you get
[2022-12-10 09:51:37] <%sadib100> how do you pronounce image?
[2022-12-10 09:51:39] <JMKS4> as long as you check it off
[2022-12-10 09:51:42] <%2pert> Hard G and cannot move me from my unbased opinion
[2022-12-10 09:51:44] <%Mirby_Studios> no the items aren't always random jmks
[2022-12-10 09:51:54] <%Mirby_Studios> it's going to be the same item in that spot
[2022-12-10 09:52:14] <JMKS4> Ahh I didn't know it was fixed
[2022-12-10 09:52:19] <%hexalotyl> Get a Gift for your Giraffe 🤷‍♀️
[2022-12-10 09:52:22] <ocyc> we're certain reloading the save state is rerolling the item right?
[2022-12-10 09:52:32] <%berniebeatsboxes> This is some bullshit
[2022-12-10 09:52:32] <@%^Nightbot> tghThis is some bullshit
[2022-12-10 09:52:32] <JMKS4> You said there was an update that fixes this?
[2022-12-10 09:53:06] <~%TGH_sr>* I play ads every 30 minutes to keep away pre-roll ads for folks upon entering stream. They also help support the channel quite a bit! Thanks for understanding! tghLink
[2022-12-10 09:53:06] <%berniebeatsboxes> Up to about 120-130
[2022-12-10 09:53:13] <PyroJakk> 30 or so I think...
[2022-12-10 09:53:13] <JMKS4> Is it installable easily or could you not continue the run on a different patch
[2022-12-10 09:53:18] <%Cerpin_> yeah something's clealy not working LUL
[2022-12-10 09:53:19] <%hexalotyl> !bullshi many times

[2022-12-10 09:53:32] <%berniebeatsboxes> For sure
[2022-12-10 09:53:41] <+D4rthD3k0y> Do you randomize the base rom of the game or a patched one?
[2022-12-10 09:53:43] <therollingninja777> would you consider it cheating to just randomize an item and add it to your backpack
[2022-12-10 09:53:47] <PyroJakk> I did join a little later
[2022-12-10 09:53:48] <%Mirby_Studios> i'm sorry i scared the item away

[2022-12-10 10:37:55] <LumPhoenix> The only saving grace of kaizo is that the vast majority of moves in the game are garbage.
[2022-12-10 10:38:14] <+SlavghterMelon> cant leave gym after entering, right?

[2022-12-10 10:41:58] <zerois000> tbh our def is way too low
[2022-12-10 10:42:00] <LumPhoenix> If the crit does that little damage it probably didn't have great spa

[2022-12-10 10:46:44] <+large_python> garage is super effective
[2022-12-10 10:46:53] <+Rootballa> and having calm mind seems okay with that downside

[2022-12-10 11:02:10] <%endrift> yeah I'm gonna agree

[2022-12-10 11:02:24] <%endrift> I think it's a bit of a shifting in meaning though

[2022-12-10 11:02:39] <TsadiqP> Cope is beef from Japan, no?
[2022-12-10 11:02:39] <+Rootballa> I thought kobe was what evolved into vespiquen
[2022-12-10 11:02:41] <lrat> I have to cope with the fact I don't know what cope means :(
[2022-12-10 11:02:43] <LuaViper> COPE, definition 1: you are in the Spring Yard Zone.

[2022-12-10 11:03:18] <TsadiqP> Cope is something you attach to a rifle to see farther, right?
[2022-12-10 11:03:19] <%Draggo__x3> Wagyu is a real thing

[2022-12-10 11:03:39] <%Draggo__x3> it's a type of cow that has its fat content dispersed pretty well and when you cut into it, it has a marbled look to it
[2022-12-10 11:03:50] <%endrift> I honestly can't believe how positive this prediction is
[2022-12-10 11:04:04] <ressurretro> How do you automatically change the move list on your overlay?
[2022-12-10 11:04:06] <%+sin_pyro> @Mirby_Studios No. That's the Pope. Cope is what you do when you are sad.

[2022-12-10 11:04:54] <%Mirby_Studios> back in my day i didn't get to see enemy health in an RPG
[2022-12-10 11:04:57] <%Draggo__x3> I wanna see the option to run
[2022-12-10 11:04:59] <%Mirby_Studios> i just had to do damage and hope it was enough

[2022-12-10 11:05:15] <LumPhoenix> Back in ye olden days if you wanted to see enemy health, you'd have to use a move.
[2022-12-10 11:05:15] <HUGHmungous> i've spent the last 5 minutes trying to make another cope wordplay joke and I got nothing

[2022-12-10 11:07:11] <%TalenLee> it would change priorities and it would make money into another stat to manage
[2022-12-10 11:07:12] <@%$CarloBrown> lol
[2022-12-10 11:07:13] <@%fsvgm777> lol.
[2022-12-10 11:07:14] <PyroJakk> I feel like this pokemon has no chance to win the game no matter what only  because of item RNG...
[2022-12-10 11:07:15] <%Yuni_Veruse> You would think an oran berry sould be used completely after getting hit by three massive base power attacks yet it would only heal four albiSus
[2022-12-10 11:07:26] <%Mirby_Studios> lol
[2022-12-10 11:07:26] <%TalenLee> which may be what you want in your variant but it does mean suddenly you have to care about that money management
[2022-12-10 11:07:31] <HydroBald> last gym hyype
[2022-12-10 11:07:35] <+Rootballa> Survival lets you buy 20 potions and the point where those potions are usable is SIGNIFICANTLY more doable, but overall? it'd just make getting to brock slightly more consistent
[2022-12-10 11:07:44] <%+sin_pyro> Wow. Another Pyro
[2022-12-10 11:07:45] <@%Iceblue> I'm losing my shit over Jim Leader

[2022-12-10 11:08:03] <%berniebeatsboxes> @Draggo__x3 Ok that's cursed
[2022-12-10 11:08:03] <%endrift> Pie plays by a more stringent version of the ruleset
[2022-12-10 11:08:08] <@%$CarloBrown> don't think pie has won so far
[2022-12-10 11:08:18] <LightLunas> @large_python nop
[2022-12-10 11:08:18] <%Draggo__x3> Pie is over 7000 attempts in with no win
[2022-12-10 11:08:24] <%sadib100> ironmon was said to be impossible
[2022-12-10 11:08:30] <HydroBald> just git gud
[2022-12-10 11:08:39] <+Rootballa> it's a perpetual content generator, and it works better than it has any right to
[2022-12-10 11:08:39] <%ShadoeHarshaw> @endrift what do you mean ive never watched him
[2022-12-10 11:08:41] <%berniebeatsboxes> But we're all here for the content at the end of the day
[2022-12-10 11:08:42] <+large_python> I also heard pie never uses any emulator speed ups/turbo. what an animal.
[2022-12-10 11:08:44] <LumPhoenix> At a minimum it was intended to be sadistic.

[2022-12-10 11:09:41] <%berniebeatsboxes> That's a really good analogy
[2022-12-10 11:09:43] <%Draggo__x3> Survival is like the Lottery reimiSmug
[2022-12-10 11:09:55] <LightLunas> they do have a point
[2022-12-10 11:10:06] <%TalenLee> my games studies nerd is already pulling apart that naalytical framework with Big Thonks
[2022-12-10 11:10:07] <HydroBald> that's a heavy boi
[2022-12-10 11:10:15] <%berniebeatsboxes> Honestly this gym hasn't been terrible so far
[2022-12-10 11:10:18] <%TalenLee> Blissey evolves from Chonksey
[2022-12-10 11:10:19] <%berniebeatsboxes> There's a chance
[2022-12-10 11:10:29] <+Rootballa> ultimate has some great pivot / catch strats
[2022-12-10 11:10:31] <%Draggo__x3> The great thing about Ultimate was. I got a Dragonite on Emerald. If it was Kaizo; that mon would've kept its original moveset all game
[2022-12-10 11:10:44] <%Draggo__x3> So it would have been unrunnable even if 600BST was allowed
[2022-12-10 11:10:47] <Sentor_G> throw scenarios at a wall and see what sticks LUL
[2022-12-10 11:11:13] <LightLunas> @ShadoeHarshaw he plays by the original rules, which have been weakened when more people wanted to play it and didn't like just how restrictive it was. For example, Pie can't catch any higher lv than his own, as opposed to up to 4 lvs higher in the current rules, and he can't use banned moves even in the lab
[2022-12-10 11:11:17] <%+flimmsovan> learn all tms? no?
[2022-12-10 11:11:19] <%$Kailaria> aside from Leftovers
[2022-12-10 11:11:20] <PyroJakk> So kaizo is basically just throwing a blind dart at a target and hoping you hit it, except the dart is 20 miles away
[2022-12-10 11:11:26] <+Rootballa> getting 6 total catches is a big one
[2022-12-10 11:11:35] <%berniebeatsboxes> That's only in Kaizo+ @flimmsovan
[2022-12-10 11:11:45] <%sadib100> ultimate is so much easier
[2022-12-10 11:11:46] <zedface0> is this your furthest?

[2022-12-10 11:12:13] <$SweetLew_> Morning Jay emerldWave
[2022-12-10 11:12:13] <%Draggo__x3> Yeah Ultimate is still extremely difficult
[2022-12-10 11:12:17] <Sentor_G> ult is not easy
[2022-12-10 11:12:21] <LightLunas> I'm not sure "easy" is the right word for Ultimate
[2022-12-10 11:12:24] <%berniebeatsboxes> Ultimate could be an interesting switch *when* we beat Kaizo
[2022-12-10 11:12:30] <$SweetLew_> wait this bat is STILL alive????
[2022-12-10 11:12:33] <+OnlyShorts> onlysh12Headbang
[2022-12-10 11:12:34] <+Rootballa> I think most ultimate seeds are beatable, but it's definitely got that Freecell vibe to it
[2022-12-10 11:12:36] <%hexalotyl> Because crystal's difficulty is busted I've given up on Kaizo and have made my own challenge between Kaizo and ultimate, it's a good time!
[2022-12-10 11:12:41] <%TalenLee> this is a GI Joebat
[2022-12-10 11:12:41] <@%^Nightbot> tghThis is a GI Joebat
[2022-12-10 11:12:51] <%Draggo__x3> I feel like you would've beat Ultimate with at least 50-60 of your good mons
[2022-12-10 11:12:54] <HydroBald> hard mode first
[2022-12-10 11:13:00] <%$ocran_> Ironmon is kind of  reminiscent of the feeling opening a pack of Pokémon cards hoping for a charizard lol. But in this case, a good mon/stats/moves

[2022-12-10 12:36:31] <S17Master> Speaking of Brock, I got my first FRLG attempt past Brock. With a slow Kingdra. Immediately thought of you LuL
[2022-12-10 12:36:42] <mathemaat> probability of beating Brock in a random seed, is lower than reaching E4 once you've beaten Brock, agreed?
[2022-12-10 12:36:56] <%+einlanzer625> Kaizo players' pokemon, inspected by Brock

[2022-12-10 12:37:08] <@%ori_sky> GOLDFUCK

[2022-12-10 12:37:10] <@%ori_sky> FOR THE RIVAL
[2022-12-10 12:37:41] <%+einlanzer625> probability of reaching e4 after beating Koga seems like it should skyrocket
[2022-12-10 12:37:48] <%Draggo__x3> 30 minutes of fuck up move
[2022-12-10 12:37:49] <%212mochaman> you always wanna stretch dungeons to the limit so theres a hope of clearing e4. there's the problem. gauntkets suck
[2022-12-10 12:37:55] <mathemaat> so 1% chance to beat Brock
[2022-12-10 12:38:03] <Worldwide_Wimpy> so getting out of lab is about 70% and about 15% of those get through Brock
[2022-12-10 12:38:13] <LightLunas> math checks out then
[2022-12-10 12:38:27] <mathemaat> about 1 in 8 I guess yeah

[2022-12-10 12:38:31] <%firin_bot> Ahh, see you get hit 45, snipe 5 star wars just needs 3 of electric and I was the end wasn't there TGH can you consider yourself now to keep sing and chat talking to tell her and got five ads, just deleting that only be impossible to replace ancientpower
[2022-12-10 12:38:34] <S17Master> Getting out of the lab is like 30% for me lol
[2022-12-10 12:38:36] <uhhnesto> Sounds right
[2022-12-10 12:38:51] <qwertygod91> math is hard
[2022-12-10 12:38:53] <LightLunas> sounds right to me
[2022-12-10 12:38:57] <%Draggo__x3> TGH can you consider yourself now to keep sing
[2022-12-10 12:39:10] <Worldwide_Wimpy> you've probably beaten brock around 60 times
[2022-12-10 12:39:12] <catfacemoo> 1% to beat brock is counting *all your seeds* ... but what's the chance of beating brock conditional on getting to him
[2022-12-10 12:39:14] <uhhnesto> !kaizo
[2022-12-10 12:39:16] <LightLunas> might just sound wrong because of how much longer you are on a single seed after Brock
[2022-12-10 12:39:21] <@%ori_sky> TGH can you consider yourself now to keep sing and chat talking
[2022-12-10 12:39:25] <%Draggo__x3> That's what firin said Jay XD

[2022-12-10 12:39:38] <Worldwide_Wimpy> beating brock is like 3-5% chance per seed

[2022-12-10 13:57:35] <+Vallie42> I wouldn't say pokemon turns 10% into 1%. I'd say it turns 10% into 1% or 90% depending on which is worse for you. 10% for an item? 1%. 10% to miss at a critical moment? 90%.
[2022-12-10 13:57:35] <Zerolicc> 75% of the time it doesnt use flame wheel but pokemon math

[2022-12-10 14:08:09] <%$llamaking__> I think it has issues guessing when you're such a low level
[2022-12-10 14:08:15] <%Draggo__x3> I'm pretty sure it's EV's because my Dragonite said "decent" but then after Winona it said "outstanding"
[2022-12-10 14:08:33] <%AmeSoso> yeah you can't check IVs on higher levels

[2022-12-10 14:08:57] <DrMaple> It takes your EV's into consideration because it just measures your stats, but it's make to be used at around level 8.
[2022-12-10 14:09:00] <%nightbringer57> It probably just calculates IVs from stats and base stats, but does not know if there are EVs or not

[2022-12-10 14:13:21] <DrMaple> After the first fight you're only going to have, at most, 6 EV's in to a single stat which wouldn't change your stats significantly. It's only basing your current stats that it shows on your Summary/Tracker and does some math to figure out if your stats are better than average for a 525 BST Mon. If your stats trend higher, it means your IV's are good so it'll say something besides "Decent". This is probably a huge paragraph at this point.

[2022-12-10 14:26:13] <%$llamaking__> @icydj He's said he prefers to not use the intro skip patch because he lets subs pick balls in the lab and not using the intro skip gives people more time

[2022-12-10 14:27:22] <%$llamaking__> It doesn't skip the parcel, it just gives it to you when you get to the town instead of running to the mart

[2022-12-10 14:27:34] <Ev4nEats0rang3Ch1ck3n> On the previous run, why’d u pick Ledian? Is this ALL luck of the draw?

[2022-12-10 14:27:55] <%+dermumpfel> i see some runners skip the pickup and everything but do an extra run through the route
[2022-12-10 14:28:01] <soundmanD> the QoL patch that speeds up the parcel sends you to the grass just before palet so you still have to go through it

[2022-12-10 14:31:15] <%AmeSoso> it's like step items, I agree with the underground path items to be spawned, but I don't think you should have the Mt. Moon ones spawned because they represent a risk to farm.

[2022-12-10 14:37:34] <%AmeSoso> @DrMaple I don't even think you can reach Slaking as an evo, right? At least stuff like Chansey doesn't.
[2022-12-10 14:37:35] <%+Metusfatum> @DrMaple we think Slaking is impossible, it hasn't happened in 2 million simulations.
[2022-12-10 14:37:39] <S17Master> @DrMaple Nothing can evolve into Slaking, its BST is too high for the other normal mons to reach
[2022-12-10 14:37:41] <Pyron18> In Gen 6 and 7 they have increased the limit to account for power creep, I think the BST limit is 655 for XY/ORAS and SM/USUM

[2022-12-10 14:39:04] <+slamdunkgator91> yes cuz slaking has a higher bst than some legendaries
[2022-12-10 14:39:13] <%Draggo__x3> most legendaries actually
[2022-12-10 14:39:31] <%212mochaman> only one legendary tops it. mewtwo

[2022-12-10 14:40:41] <%AstralStorm> Deoxys is a plain legendary right? and nothing can evolve there
[2022-12-10 14:40:47] <%Draggo__x3> Deoxys is a Pseudo Legendary BST. Like wow.
[2022-12-10 14:40:58] <%Draggo__x3> Interesting because it was literally the most broken mon in this gen in vanilla
