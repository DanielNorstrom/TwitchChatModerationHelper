[2022-12-19 16:53:52] <%CronicBrownie> "i'm in a bush right now"
[2022-12-19 16:53:55] <%+drumzzyy> "hey guys i think im gonna hide here"
[2022-12-19 16:53:56] <+devilishpuppy> he probably could have waited in there though
[2022-12-19 16:53:57] <Strawdrinker> if he stayed in the bush he wouldnt of been found
[2022-12-19 16:54:00] <Moestii> He shoulda stayed in the bush he wouldve escaped
[2022-12-19 16:54:00] <xREDxNOVAx> The S+ was going 80mph max tho. The wheels poppin' was the icing on the cake LUL
[2022-12-19 16:54:04] <%nipplesoffreeman> i knew it was over at that point
[2022-12-19 16:54:09] <%+drumzzyy> hahahahahhahahahahahaha
[2022-12-19 16:54:12] <+devilishpuppy> He could have gotten away if with it. only reason he got caught is because he left
[2022-12-19 16:54:14] <MUWAT> clip? lol
[2022-12-19 16:54:16] <banj0oo> yeah that was for real a questionable play
[2022-12-19 16:54:16] <motionMF> He coulda repaired everything too
[2022-12-19 16:54:17] <%CronicBrownie> they probably wouldn't have found him if he didn't leave the bush KEKW
[2022-12-19 16:54:17] <xREDxNOVAx> And technically they didn't for some reason lmao
[2022-12-19 16:54:19] <SpaceCase4200> they didnt find him till he left the bush tho
[2022-12-19 16:54:19] <%bastrupkekw> @DbblD If only u knew :D
[2022-12-19 16:54:22] <+azoric> to be fair, they didn't, he was only spotted when driving away
[2022-12-19 16:54:23] <+Beafour> @golden_eagle_567 He has some amazing tucks though, might have become to reliant on tucking because of the success
[2022-12-19 16:54:23] <itzsham> ohh
[2022-12-19 16:54:23] <+devilishpuppy> they had no clue he was in that bush
[2022-12-19 16:54:29] <%Eternaldeall> can definitely say his anger clouded his judgment
[2022-12-19 16:54:34] <%$b4none> summits issue is , he has no awearness of his surroundings. He is a god tier driver, but has no idea what is going on around him
[2022-12-19 16:54:35] <DbblD> LUL
[2022-12-19 16:54:37] <%StrainGaming> especially beacuse the bush had like 3 leaves
[2022-12-19 16:54:38] <%Blackmonte187> nobody saw him in the bush tho

[2022-12-19 16:55:00] <+devilishpuppy> he only got caught because he crawled out the bush onto the highway

[2022-12-19 16:56:49] <%+drumzzyy> true
[2022-12-19 16:56:52] <+Beafour> @devilishpuppy He should have at least repaired more tires and the car at that point, he literally waited until the cops could gather their thoughts doing nothing to try to sneak away
[2022-12-19 16:56:53] <%+Wagzoo> I mean he wasnt trying to get there in the first place. But he couldn’t drive the car well so that’s where it ended up
[2022-12-19 16:57:05] <B3KA> yeah sure it's not a gerat hiding spot but many tiems cops don't see the car unless it moves
[2022-12-19 16:57:06] <boji1029> yea I do not think anyone is saying it is a good spot lol

[2022-12-19 17:01:20] <+sabbaer6666> the decision is made by the leading cop on chase
[2022-12-19 17:01:21] <SmadaG> They literally stop chases because of that
[2022-12-19 17:01:25] <%ToxicWaste7> yo
[2022-12-19 17:01:25] <%taraist_> I mean a cops job is to DEESCULATE... so
[2022-12-19 17:01:30] <%+ezi86> chawa had a rough day in the city all around yesterday
[2022-12-19 17:01:31] <+devilishpuppy> they could have chased for 5 more minute sand the car would have been out of fuel
[2022-12-19 17:01:34] <fewkes5> Never cuz we want out streamer to always win🤡🤡🤡

[2022-12-19 17:01:34] <%CronicBrownie> yeah can't really have 3 hour chases
[2022-12-19 17:01:38] <boji1029> hard to answer when trackers can last 40 minutes
[2022-12-19 17:01:39] <%tdodrago> Ramming does not = killing
[2022-12-19 17:01:41] <%StonedAxolotl> Forever Hutch! i want a Forever RP Chase Kappa
[2022-12-19 17:01:43] <+simbayugen> Tbh once the crim is endangering others lives it should be allowed
[2022-12-19 17:01:43] <%GGreatscott> I feel like the cops s+ mode was out performing the boost s+
[2022-12-19 17:01:44] <tiltsalot> multiple chases yesterday and the day before pd warning crims to not pit at high speeds before any crim tried pitting only for the pd to pit at 110 plus
[2022-12-19 17:01:45] <+simbayugen> Irl
[2022-12-19 17:01:46] <+Lardacus> I feel like the aggression can be amped up sooner if Air1 isn't involved, but if Air1 is up then maybe don't go straight to pitting
[2022-12-19 17:01:51] <+simbayugen> But city is different
[2022-12-19 17:01:51] <+afrasiabhaider123> @B3KA No it aint ramming is ramming and killing is killing
[2022-12-19 17:01:58] <+devilishpuppy> @CronicBrownie then make how quickly the car runs out of fuel then

[2022-12-19 17:02:29] <+afrasiabhaider123> @GGreatscott No it wasnt chawa almost out ran cops multiple times, he just had a passenger in the car
[2022-12-19 17:02:36] <B3KA> more car takes dsmage kmroe fuel it wastes
[2022-12-19 17:02:42] <%taraist_> i wish i could do RP based on 2 words ;p
[2022-12-19 17:02:46] <%$b4none> why is this even a conversation, charles messed up and lost the boost. Why blame the cops or the hacker? This one was on him

[2022-12-19 17:03:07] <+devilishpuppy> @CronicBrownie i know, i'm saying your answer just isn't 'takes 3 hours' when its a self made problem when they have the ability to change that

[2022-12-19 17:03:15] <B3KA> @HORIZONTALHOURGLASS u mean shift 3 cops
[2022-12-19 17:03:16] <tiltsalot> I blame the snow tbh
[2022-12-19 17:03:24] <+afrasiabhaider123> @Lardacus Air 1 wasnt even on the chase and it was only 4 ppl chasing 95% of the chase
[2022-12-19 17:03:24] <+millsot> rachet is so funny
[2022-12-19 17:03:35] <banj0oo> @HORIZONTALHOURGLASS oh yeah summit hates the shift 3 cops
[2022-12-19 17:03:47] <huntergray24k> to be fair they didnt pit summit until like deep in the chase
[2022-12-19 17:03:54] <MUWAT> my eye holes need some DnD
[2022-12-19 17:03:58] <%CronicBrownie> @devilishpuppy i'm not here to debate. sorry homie. I was just making a statement to go along with what hutch was saying
[2022-12-19 17:04:06] <%Wootloops> @banj0oo then he should get on during normal hours lol
[2022-12-19 17:04:06] <+simbayugen> Any pit above 70 could be considered manslaughter
[2022-12-19 17:04:07] <SpaceCase4200> correction TBONED him
[2022-12-19 17:04:10] <huntergray24k> randy waas on aj an stopped them from doin it early on
[2022-12-19 17:04:16] <SpaceCase4200> while spiked
[2022-12-19 17:04:17] <TrinidadHype> at the end of the day Summit had his chances to escape
[2022-12-19 17:04:22] <+devilishpuppy> @CronicBrownie thats called debating
[2022-12-19 17:04:23] <%+ThtGuyJay> plus people dont understand that cars on gta bounce when tapped so boxing is very hard and often looks like repeated ramming
[2022-12-19 17:04:25] <muadting22> last night if not for AJ they would've shot chawa as soon as other ppl shot cops
[2022-12-19 17:04:28] <+afrasiabhaider123> TBH the boys fucked the S+ chase with the high speed rams, the cops were actually holding back so much
[2022-12-19 17:04:33] <banj0oo> @Wootloops i wish man i cant stay up utill 3 anymore
[2022-12-19 17:04:36] <%+raivo0x> people say hutch is blind by the snow and me say peak is blind because he lose one eye Kappa
[2022-12-19 17:04:36] <SpaceCase4200> Tbone a spiked care makes sense
[2022-12-19 17:04:36] <sherminator011> it would have been so much worse if randy wasn't on cop
[2022-12-19 17:04:37] <B3KA> t boning is one of the worst thigns cops do

[2022-12-19 17:05:29] <tiltsalot> they didnt get the boost, but he dropped a cpl cops not a big deal hes still s++
[2022-12-19 17:05:38] <+devilishpuppy> @CronicBrownie yep zoriOkBUD
[2022-12-19 17:05:45] <huntergray24k> @theshystoner thats why its called an opinion lmfao
[2022-12-19 17:06:01] <%+GotEmMissing> This discussion happens on every server. The problem is its RP so you have to be conscious of pitting vs attempted murder with a vehicle. It is about making it fun on both sides. If cops were getting shot at then their lives were already in danger so pitting and ramming at that point instead of just shooting was the less aggressive option and gives driver a chance to escape still even on foot.

[2022-12-19 21:29:59] <bear_ruthlessss> Game looks like a first person Diablo especially with the inventory. that’s pretty cool

[2022-12-19 21:30:19] <ATypicalJimmy> the weapon has to be in hand in order to give you the stats
[2022-12-19 21:30:28] <+spookyskellly> proably shows it as (not equiped) like when you start the match
[2022-12-19 21:30:38] <ATypicalJimmy> so it wont show in lobby or whatever, put it in hand in game and it changes.
