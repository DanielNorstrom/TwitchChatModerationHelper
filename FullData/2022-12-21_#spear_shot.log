I do appreciate you saying that. But the truth is: Your sisters and your auntie love me. So you really shouldn't say that... :) honestly. You're gonna call me daddy soon if you keep talking like that. Cuz I'll literally fuck your mum out of spite. Trust me I'd seduce her on the couch. Your mom's legs will get caressed you bitch.

I do appreciate you saying that. But the truth is: Your sisters and your auntie love me. So you really shouldn't say that... :) honestly. You're gonna call me daddy soon if you keep talking like that. Cuz I'll literally fuck your mum out of spite. Trust me I'd seduce her on the couch. Your mom's legs will get caressed you bitch.
