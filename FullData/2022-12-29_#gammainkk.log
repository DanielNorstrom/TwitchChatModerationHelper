[2022-12-29 11:20:13] <$zach_shield> Speaking of animals. So my house used to have a pond of fish, which an otter came by to steal for food one time. So my dad, set up a trap, which was a cage to catch it. But he was like "Ahhh, it won't die. It'll live" and couple days later, the otter died. So my dad can technically be reported cuz our country has a law that says endangered animals (otters being one) are NOT to be hurt

[2022-12-29 15:06:08] <Extrahu3> The feint usually is placed on Tank Buster

[2022-12-29 15:07:27] <Extrahu3> that one for 3+ targets
[2022-12-29 15:07:29] <!%+LittleThymbol> If the boss doesn't move too much you use doton since it does more damage than kaiton
[2022-12-29 15:07:36] <!%+LittleThymbol> Otherwise spam kaiton
[2022-12-29 15:07:41] VIEWERS: 434
[2022-12-29 15:07:59] <Extrahu3> Yeah Doton and Kaiton go on multiple targets
[2022-12-29 15:08:07] <Extrahu3> Doton Single target is not bad but not as good as raiton
[2022-12-29 15:08:16] <Extrahu3> yeyeyeyeyeye
[2022-12-29 15:08:19] <Extrahu3> good to learn
[2022-12-29 15:08:38] <Extrahu3> NODDERS i reccomend the level60 synced content
[2022-12-29 15:08:46] <Extrahu3> since you get more Quality of Life on the toolkit
[2022-12-29 15:09:06] <Extrahu3> NODDERS yeyeyyeye
[2022-12-29 15:09:33] <!%+LittleThymbol> The best way to learn a class is potd in my opinion

[2022-12-29 15:09:50] <!%+LittleThymbol> You starrt from level 1 and progress to 60 really quickly
[2022-12-29 15:10:02] <%kernymi> you'd get better overview of your skill if you use compact view
