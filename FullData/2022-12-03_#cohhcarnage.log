[2022-12-03 00:00:05] <%bros402> @Manaron cohhHug
[2022-12-03 00:00:34] <%bros402> welcome to the cohhilition Manaron
[2022-12-03 00:00:43] <%Spero_Mcgee> @Vosy1984 thing is I dont know if most players do their own thing or follow a guide. And what works for someone else might not for you
[2022-12-03 00:00:49] <+Manaron> The plains boss I missed when I had figured out that he comes back after morning streams but it took me until day 7 to figure out there is night streams LUL
[2022-12-03 00:01:07] <+Manaron> <3 ty bros
[2022-12-03 00:01:15] <+Manaron> I feel cozy here
[2022-12-03 00:01:40] <%Vosy1984> @Vosy1984 make it work :) I adapted nugi's blade trapper last league and made it work

[2022-12-03 00:01:54] <%Spero_Mcgee> But irregardless, thanks to the poison buildup. Things like keeping Virulence up for the crawler from herald of Agony is easy and also Plaguebringer
[2022-12-03 00:02:03] <+Manaron> I meant bros402 not "bros" LUL
[2022-12-03 00:02:36] <%bros402> so how were the games today in stream
[2022-12-03 00:02:37] <%Astorma> There's actually people who use "irregardless". cohhLUL
[2022-12-03 00:02:54] <%bros402> missed it because I was seeing oncologist or driving to/from NYC
[2022-12-03 00:03:05] <+Manaron> unirregardless @Astorma figure out the meaning of that one Kappa

[2022-12-03 00:05:26] <%$oddknight> @bros402 overrall id say good games with terrible pc ports
[2022-12-03 00:05:28] <%Spero_Mcgee> cohhHmm Slayer might be the ascendancy to go for, it has the melee strike range, it has Your Maximum Endurance Charges is equal to your Maximum Frenzy Charges +1 to Maximum Frenzy Charges. And the cull strike at 20%
[2022-12-03 00:05:28] <+Manaron> @Astorma I really thought that it emphasized that you shouldn't disregard something. But no! It just means the same.
[2022-12-03 00:06:04] <%Spero_Mcgee> Duelist is also far closer to the Iron Will notable and Utmost Might cohhHmm
[2022-12-03 00:06:30] <%DanVelly> cohhHmm might have to go for Slayer just to try out some charge mtx
[2022-12-03 00:06:31] <%Vosy1984> why not go for phy dot as a duelist
[2022-12-03 00:06:32] <%bros402> @oddknight ok, since I mostly saw the start of stutter--i mean Callisto Protocol

[2022-12-03 00:07:08] <%Spero_Mcgee> @Vosy1984 Thats why I was talking about Lightning Exsanguinate earlier. Reap would also work
[2022-12-03 00:07:19] <%Spero_Mcgee> And of course Corrupting Fever no reason not to
[2022-12-03 00:07:24] <%$oddknight> @bros402 LUL seems to be only on pc , on ps5 its running well
[2022-12-03 00:07:41] <%$oddknight> because were back to that now, companies phoning in pc ports woooooooo
[2022-12-03 00:08:32] <%bros402> PC >>> console
[2022-12-03 00:08:51] <%bros402> PC is much better in terms of accessibility imo
[2022-12-03 00:08:57] <%Spero_Mcgee> could maybe add an archmage support in there cohhHmm
[2022-12-03 00:09:41] <%Vosy1984> do not
[2022-12-03 00:09:43] <%Vosy1984> LUL
[2022-12-03 00:09:50] <%Spero_Mcgee> although no, the mana cost would be too low
[2022-12-03 00:10:02] <%Spero_Mcgee> it would require mana cost increase shenagins
[2022-12-03 00:10:11] <RedXIII> how did cohh like midnight sun?
[2022-12-03 00:10:19] <%Spero_Mcgee> apeps rage would be perfect in that situation though
[2022-12-03 00:10:22] <RedXIII> I didn't want to watch because I'm currently just starting up.
[2022-12-03 00:10:50] <Botamigo> does cohh as the killing of moder on youtube? i cnt find it

[2022-12-03 00:11:05] <%Vosy1984> get a pob with poet's pen and follow it, cf reap/exsanguinate and go with it

[2022-12-03 00:11:56] <%Spero_Mcgee> @Vosy1984 Reap or exsanguinate is just an extra dot. The main idea is to stick with lightning attacks or spells
[2022-12-03 00:12:11] <%$oddknight> @bros402 pc is the better platform no contest there, it does suck that pc has to deal with very poor quality ports at times tho
[2022-12-03 00:12:14] <%Spero_Mcgee> The new Frozen Legion is apparently a spell attack for example
[2022-12-03 00:12:53] <%KuroNekosama999> Re-Summon Cohh cohhBongos
[2022-12-03 00:13:12] <%Mr_Satan__> cohhHi  chat
[2022-12-03 00:13:14] <%Vosy1984> good luck converting than, imo you will loose a lot of damage

[2022-12-03 00:13:46] <%Spero_Mcgee> pity there isnt a gem info for it yet
[2022-12-03 00:14:01] <%Spero_Mcgee> Id assume it converts 50% to cold damage
[2022-12-03 00:14:10] <%Vosy1984> gems are usually released on Tuesday or Wednesday
[2022-12-03 00:14:28] <%Spero_Mcgee> good to know
[2022-12-03 00:14:43] <%Vosy1984> usually
[2022-12-03 00:14:48] <%Spero_Mcgee> But if it happens to be a cold skill it doesnt really change much
[2022-12-03 00:15:00] <@%^CohhilitionBot> Have a great clip from the stream you'd like to see in the Monthly Highlight reel? Get your name on it by submitting the clips HERE! -> http://www.cohh.tv/clips Also show the community in our forum! -> http://www.cohh.tv/clipsforum cohhGG cohhCheer
[2022-12-03 00:15:01] <%Spero_Mcgee> just use the cold version of Volkuurs Guidance instead
[2022-12-03 00:15:27] <%Spero_Mcgee> lightning can be converted to cold but I dont think the other way around is possible
[2022-12-03 00:15:54] <MugenRichie> so he is doing the watch party and then Valheim right?
[2022-12-03 00:15:59] <%Vosy1984> everything is possible and can be converted, except dots
[2022-12-03 00:16:53] <%Spero_Mcgee> I havent tried alchemist mark, but supposedly that gives off a chaos ground if you poison or a fire ground if you ignite enemies

[2022-12-03 00:17:27] <%Spero_Mcgee> https://www.poewiki.net/wiki/Stormfire this makes it possible to have Lightning damage ignite
[2022-12-03 00:17:30] <%Vosy1984> I tried it once, didn't really see the benefits of it and changed to another mark
[2022-12-03 00:17:50] <%Spero_Mcgee> yeah that seems to be the overall talk about it
[2022-12-03 00:17:59] <%Spero_Mcgee> the other marks are simply better
[2022-12-03 00:18:06] <%Vosy1984> yes, but what are you scaling? lightning or ignite?
[2022-12-03 00:19:10] <%Spero_Mcgee> stormfire apparently makes it so that both lightning and fire modifiers would work in that regard.
[2022-12-03 00:19:14] <%Spero_Mcgee> its just an extra
[2022-12-03 00:19:59] <%Vosy1984> you need more than just that
[2022-12-03 00:20:08] <%Spero_Mcgee> If Im reading alchemist mark correctly it would seem that it would benefit the most from single hard hitting attacks/spells that either ignite or poison
[2022-12-03 00:20:17] <%+tregis_artist> incoming hello queue.... in 3... 2 .... 1
[2022-12-03 00:20:21] <%Spero_Mcgee> because it will drop either or both based on the highest hit
[2022-12-03 00:20:38] <%Spero_Mcgee> which to me implies a 2H build

[2022-12-03 00:21:09] <%+tregis_artist> didn't work :/
[2022-12-03 00:21:39] <%Vosy1984> ok, theory craft it, let me know what conclusion you reach
[2022-12-03 00:22:18] <%Spero_Mcgee> https://www.poewiki.net/wiki/Brain_Rattler this one was a favorite of mine
[2022-12-03 00:23:16] <%Spero_Mcgee> as far as poisoning etc goes I already know it works but in regards to alchemist mark it just be weird I think
[2022-12-03 00:23:21] <%Vosy1984> carefull with how many uniques you add to pob, you also want resistances
[2022-12-03 00:24:20] <%Spero_Mcgee> the flask recharge of it might be nice for non pathfinders but other then that cohhHmm
[2022-12-03 00:25:00] <%Spero_Mcgee> yeah my resists typically come from belts, shield and boots
[2022-12-03 00:25:15] <%Spero_Mcgee> and the rings ofc if theres no uniques in there
[2022-12-03 00:25:51] <%Spero_Mcgee> but thats why I mentioned surviving might be an issue at times
[2022-12-03 00:26:17] <%Vosy1984> plan your build around rares and use uniques later?
[2022-12-03 00:26:43] <%Spero_Mcgee> dont be silly
[2022-12-03 00:26:44] <%+ShabamzleTV> did cohh like midnight suns? i fell asleep during that stream
[2022-12-03 00:26:59] <%$oddknight> he did
[2022-12-03 00:27:05] <%Spero_Mcgee> My build idea at the very least has to use Volkuurs guidance
[2022-12-03 00:27:27] <%+ShabamzleTV> @oddknight doodShake doodShake doodShake
[2022-12-03 00:27:33] <%Spero_Mcgee> and the main reason to use uniques is because the stats of them are kniown

[2022-12-03 00:32:37] <%Spero_Mcgee> I think theres some upcoming games in december though that cohh might look at like Crisis Core Reunion. I remember him talking fondly about playing it on the PSP ages ago
[2022-12-03 00:32:55] <%Spero_Mcgee> It wouldnt be too unusual to do a playthrough of that
[2022-12-03 00:33:01] <%DanVelly> @Kunguru He has confirmed he will play it once more sponsored and atleast 1 additional time non-sponsored
[2022-12-03 00:33:08] <%Astorma> Nothing interesting in December after Callisto is done. cohhBoom
[2022-12-03 00:33:26] <%KuroNekosama999> alas cohhBoom

[2022-12-03 01:35:42] <@%xZannahx> DarmanORC oh dear cohhLUL I prefer that too! Make sure you get some rest and time for yourself cohhL
[2022-12-03 01:35:44] <%KuroNekosama999> and lets you craft from a chest
[2022-12-03 01:35:44] <+keikaku_cat> PogChamp thats pretty good
[2022-12-03 01:35:45] <Jeff1241> Merely a friendly jab but Sir Cohh Vikings didnt have that much QOL
[2022-12-03 01:35:45] <ganjalf_the_baked> grounded NODDERS
[2022-12-03 01:35:46] <NocturnalLogic> NODDERS
[2022-12-03 01:35:47] <+casual_memer> like in Raft
[2022-12-03 01:35:48] <Kyetris> Auto-Sort
[2022-12-03 01:35:48] <%+kojiro311> before inventory sort it really needs armor slots so they don't clutter the inventory.
[2022-12-03 01:35:49] <+Spaceboy70> That would be HUGE
[2022-12-03 01:35:49] <%ToughMochi> not many games have that but those that do are great NODDERS
[2022-12-03 01:35:49] <+chud28> Just like terraria
[2022-12-03 01:35:51] <Caryll_> Terraria did that well
[2022-12-03 01:35:52] <%+UN_Synapse> STARDEW
[2022-12-03 01:35:54] <%$Relair> maybe also a button for auto play when we're at it Cohh? cohhT
[2022-12-03 01:35:56] <Swedishdude5> It would also be great if they made the Z-value stuff better
[2022-12-03 01:35:56] <%Spero_Mcgee> that sounds like what a mod would do
[2022-12-03 01:35:57] <%KuroNekosama999> Raft, Grounded do that cohhLUL
[2022-12-03 01:35:58] <+EFlatStrat> Sounds like some form of Voodoo to me
[2022-12-03 01:35:58] <%ErksEagles> Grounded does that right
[2022-12-03 01:36:00] <%DestroyerOfSushi> Linked chests NODDERS
[2022-12-03 01:36:01] <%Brobonobo> good QoL hard to programm
[2022-12-03 01:36:03] <its_STAARK> mods lmaoo
[2022-12-03 01:36:03] <+ShookMusic> yee
[2022-12-03 01:36:04] <%Rool_Gonzalez> that would bee too much of QoL ;)
[2022-12-03 01:36:06] <+RebelFoxtrot> there are mods that already do everything you just described. So shouldn't be hard for devs to implement.
[2022-12-03 01:36:07] <Sivadselim> Minecraft addon
[2022-12-03 01:36:09] <+ajaxstax> oh yes for sure!
[2022-12-03 01:36:09] <SKDubz> another HUGE one
[2022-12-03 01:36:09] <%kibriel> i like the game just fine without any of those things
[2022-12-03 01:36:09] <+casual_memer> hmm

[2022-12-03 01:36:10] <+jisinbut> you can do the crafting bench suggestion in valheim plus
[2022-12-03 01:36:10] <NocturnalLogic> OMG YES that would be gamechanging
[2022-12-03 01:36:11] <+ETS05> hey chat, was going to watch @cohhcarnage's vid for Calisto, are the tech issues that bad?

[2022-12-03 01:36:12] <kevin_27> that makes to much sense
[2022-12-03 01:36:12] <TikiArray> basically, it should be terraria, but 3d
[2022-12-03 01:36:12] <mattywill4> like grounded

[2022-12-03 01:36:16] <%DestroyerOfSushi> NODDERS yes yes and yes
[2022-12-03 01:36:16] <Yuvall> but that would be too easy
[2022-12-03 01:36:17] <+Spaceboy70> NODDERS
[2022-12-03 01:36:18] <Kyetris> Mods have those but i would love it in the base game
[2022-12-03 01:36:18] <+relyks88> every survival game needs those...
[2022-12-03 01:36:18] <%nefer2275> we playd a game that had that auto sort at each chest....which one was it?
[2022-12-03 01:36:19] <+faceplantt_kagers> Like the ESO Craft bag
[2022-12-03 01:36:20] <Hubungus> I see Grounded left a nice impact
[2022-12-03 01:36:20] <%Greven_pbs> And finally it should play by itself LUL
[2022-12-03 01:36:20] <+ajaxstax> yes Vanilla.
[2022-12-03 01:36:20] <jogardar> so no more being sad when crafting?

[2022-12-03 01:36:28] <Kellummaul> the armor you are wearing should not take inventory slots
[2022-12-03 01:36:30] <oger901> those are great QOL things!
[2022-12-03 01:36:31] <DoItJustDoIt> @cohhcarnage have u tried Valheim+ ?
[2022-12-03 01:36:31] <%+UN_Synapse> I still have no idea why games dont link storage.
[2022-12-03 01:36:32] <+JoeUzee> clip it
[2022-12-03 01:36:32] <%+nostradomus00> didn't Grounded's Crafting Bench work that way?
[2022-12-03 01:36:32] <%sorengb123> GOTY
[2022-12-03 01:36:36] <yoyourmister> so essentially become terraria
[2022-12-03 01:36:36] <%+KBToyz7> clip and ship to the devs......
[2022-12-03 01:36:37] <%Nimryl> nope... elden ring is
[2022-12-03 01:36:37] <@%Suzunahara> @DoItJustDoIt he hasn't, no

[2022-12-03 01:36:38] <xxxxdarksiderxxxx> perfect!
[2022-12-03 01:36:39] <lSoltisl> so basically grounded?
[2022-12-03 01:36:39] <%MrTotoPierro> Mods already exist for 3 of 4 of these QoL so devs hav no excuses for not putting them in
[2022-12-03 01:36:39] <%FriedPBJ> EZ GOTY
[2022-12-03 01:36:39] <@%nuuriell> And the one thing it needs the most: Lemon vodka for Cohh.
[2022-12-03 01:36:40] <%+Firefox1k> Amen. Pls devs.
[2022-12-03 01:36:40] <+casual_memer> I'd say longer food times, or at least more sustainable options
[2022-12-03 01:36:41] <%+Drak0v> You ask for those last time.
[2022-12-03 01:36:42] <+Aint_easy_being_deazy> @CohhCarnage what about elder buff adding less stamina usage?
[2022-12-03 01:36:42] <FeldonCain> And here I thought QOL was heighten by adding kittens...
[2022-12-03 01:36:44] <%DarmanORC> xZannahx no worries there NODDERS Sunday I am going to my great aunt's house with a bunch of other family members, the house has been in the fam for decades and is getting sold soon so going one last time cohhCozy and then the gift wrapping I have to do cohhSuffer

[2022-12-03 01:36:47] <+Cyex__> @nostradomus00 they do!

[2022-12-03 01:37:39] <!BobFolowski> it's extremely satisfying LUL
[2022-12-03 01:37:39] <Giakaama> It needs also balancing of weapons, when fighting the boss from plains . It needs to do more with black metal not send you to farm iron again when playing plains ...

[2022-12-03 01:37:49] <+Fenthule> @depressean_ hard disagree unless it's a SUPER late game add on
[2022-12-03 01:37:52] <@%+ReverendDrew> And that glass autofills with the click of a button

[2022-12-03 01:37:55] <%+DinosaurousMike> I would also love the "stacks of wood/stone" you can place act as *big* storage for the related resource. it would incentivize using them cosmetically a lot more.
[2022-12-03 01:37:56] <B3yBlade> I mean this game has pretty much limitless possibiliies
[2022-12-03 01:37:56] <mals2014> agreed

[2022-12-03 01:38:48] <%+no_cont35t> @cohhcarnage you should try putting vodka seltzer in a glass with a fresh lemon wedge squeezed in. tastes like an alcohol less sugary lemonade
[2022-12-03 01:38:50] <+StageName> and drunkier
[2022-12-03 01:38:50] <%OMNARAYANA> @dustershields in this game you can ride on tamed lox
[2022-12-03 01:38:51] <Swedishdude5> The is actually a traditional elderflower flavoured liquor that is drank at midsummer that they should really add
[2022-12-03 01:38:51] <+keikaku_cat> Cohh should have his own brand of hard lemonade.
[2022-12-03 01:38:52] <%T3rrortrooper> When you started - i was on the fence for a second @CohhCarnage but i actually agree with your four points... or we all get good and remember where we put stuff... all the freaking time @CohhCarnage  cohhWhiskey    cohhGV

[2022-12-03 01:39:12] <@%Suzunahara> @ETS05 it'll look bad at first, but he fixes it with some settings changes ^^. it's very smooth shortly into the playthrough

[2022-12-03 01:48:56] <%MrTotoPierro> The first time you fight the boss you dont need to summon it
[2022-12-03 01:48:57] <%+SuzakuAndEoh> It's only gonna get absurder
[2022-12-03 01:48:57] <@%Suzunahara> @eskman10 Cohh could make the magic stuff now, but he hasn't yet
[2022-12-03 01:49:03] <%+nickfrenzy> yeah but then it'll be super absurd

[2022-12-03 01:49:57] <%WhySoSeriousBroo> @CohhCarnage I get burnt out easily in Valheim, what would you suggest to prevent that? More clear goals?
[2022-12-03 01:50:01] <Neverywhere> The cloak that negates fall damage was from the magic craft bench, maybe that counts? @CohhCarnage  :)
[2022-12-03 01:50:02] <@%Suzunahara> @k1tta that's the wisp Sword, I forget it's proper name. But it has the Wisplight effect without needing a Wisplight equipped
[2022-12-03 01:50:04] <hipnotica> check the crossbow
[2022-12-03 01:50:17] <%+tregis_artist> mods ban me and you give em money ??? :p

[2022-12-03 01:51:26] <%+magpie_74> is this Vanilla playthrough
[2022-12-03 01:51:36] <%WhySoSeriousBroo> @WhySoSeriousBroo Well when it takes days to reach my goal I start losing the flame
[2022-12-03 01:51:36] <Human_Variant> @magpie_74 yes
[2022-12-03 01:51:37] <@%Suzunahara> @42Panda it's a wisp infused sword, so you don't need the Wisplight to haev the Wisp mist-clearing effect
[2022-12-03 01:51:38] <$Hidden_Hybrid> @magpie_74 yes
[2022-12-03 01:51:44] <@%Suzunahara> @magpie_74 sure is ^^
[2022-12-03 01:52:03] <%KuroNekosama999> is this what the spiral stairs look like? cohhFocus I havent seen them built yet

[2022-12-03 01:52:12] <%WhySoSeriousBroo> @kakaochen @slicethanex it feels a bit unfair but maybe cohhSus
[2022-12-03 01:52:15] <$Hidden_Hybrid> cohh always lets us know in the title if he is using mods
[2022-12-03 01:52:21] <+chrisabbott91> What is the glowing sword Cohh has made from??
[2022-12-03 01:52:22] <%RhinoRich> can you still get wood from roots in crypts
[2022-12-03 01:52:45] <@%Suzunahara> @chrisabbott91 it's a wisp infused sword, it has the Wisplight effect of mist clearing but frees you up to wear Megingjord in Mistlands
[2022-12-03 01:52:46] <%+MexxyDragon> cohhBongos hello again cute cohh, cute chat, and cute mods cohhBongos

[2022-12-03 01:53:26] <+chrisabbott91> I'm still working up to fighting Modor.... so I'm behind Cohh at this point.
[2022-12-03 01:53:44] <%Captainkingdog> Could you convert a ruin to a base in this game?

[2022-12-03 01:55:04] <@%Suzunahara> @ProductionValue he's planning to play it again soon I believe ^^
[2022-12-03 01:55:06] <%+DobbsjustDobbs> @CohhCarnage you planning on/excited for playing through this game 4 more times from scratch for each new boss? LUL
[2022-12-03 01:55:12] <Cbizcbiz> cool sword
[2022-12-03 01:55:13] <+Dobbs01> I love Valheim when is the new patch hitting live?
[2022-12-03 01:55:14] <+chrisabbott91> @Captainkingdog Yes, you can build using some of the ruins you find in the world.  Having a stonecutter table allows you to repair them as well.
[2022-12-03 01:55:16] <$Hidden_Hybrid> @Fenthule valid point
[2022-12-03 01:55:16] <+DeadeyeWolff> The bosses should drop special items randomly to use for building next tiers weapons to give you a reason to go back and fight them again
[2022-12-03 01:55:18] <%KuroNekosama999> I still wish we could tame bunnies cohhOld
[2022-12-03 01:55:21] <%ProductionValue> thanks suzu!
[2022-12-03 01:55:22] <LockDown337> its dose, a lil
[2022-12-03 01:55:25] <%+FallingAsunder> Adventurer Cohh and his mighty sword Bonk.
[2022-12-03 01:55:27] <%+SuzakuAndEoh> It slightly keeps the mist away.  Wisplight still better
[2022-12-03 01:55:31] <@%Suzunahara> it's supposed to clear just holding it... but wow it's not as good as an actual Wisplight
[2022-12-03 01:55:34] <%DarmanORC> KuroNekosama999 rabbit stew is good NODDERS
[2022-12-03 01:55:36] <%lefrenchie> maybe if you lvl it uip

[2022-12-03 01:55:40] <+Fenthule> do they stack ?
[2022-12-03 01:55:40] <xdyabolical> is there a new boss for the mistlands?
[2022-12-03 01:55:42] <silver_streakz> the whisp is much better than the sword
[2022-12-03 01:55:49] <@%Suzunahara> @ProductionValue no problem cohhL

[2022-12-03 01:56:46] <@%Suzunahara> so did I. This mist clearing is definitely not the same quality as the Wisplight, sadly

[2022-12-03 01:58:05] <@%Suzunahara> @00oniking00 6th biome. when you consider they're adding at least 2 more after this I sort of get it, but maybe a bit too late

[2022-12-03 02:01:44] <+datDamnWizard> Piercing is good against lox
[2022-12-03 02:01:44] <+Fenthule> your sword levelis also SUPER low
[2022-12-03 02:01:51] <OverlordPeach> and fire

[2022-12-03 02:01:57] <%+0lincoln0> Krom sword is great
[2022-12-03 02:01:57] <dragonfly996> Lox are resistant to cold
[2022-12-03 02:01:58] <%lefrenchie> this is good for llvs tho
[2022-12-03 02:02:04] <+RebelFoxtrot> The two handed sword is by far my favourite new weapon.
[2022-12-03 02:02:06] <%+SuzakuAndEoh> Gotta get that electric spear.  Bet that would mess them up
[2022-12-03 02:02:07] <%kakaochen> Lox just wants cuddles cohhPat
[2022-12-03 02:02:07] <Sockerbagaren> is the secondary attack piercing on this sword?
[2022-12-03 02:02:12] <+keikaku_cat> this is why i use claws, i at least get the satisfaction of punching the lox
[2022-12-03 02:02:13] <%00oniking00> @Suzunahara it is, the first for give us the horn to make the pickaxe right? you can use that item with raw ambar to make a wisp light (same stuff but only light in area) and a heal rune that you can upgrade... the mod have fireball rune, frost spike rune... with new boss itens you can make new and cool runes to do magick
[2022-12-03 02:02:15] <n3wtpond> What a strange looking animal
[2022-12-03 02:02:15] <dimewin> The ice mace is the best always
[2022-12-03 02:02:15] <Swedishdude5> lox resist frost :(
[2022-12-03 02:02:19] <+RandyB123> Slashing is good too, this sword must be mostly elemental dmg
[2022-12-03 02:02:19] <Nubatack> i remember dying to more than 1 goblin, this is great
[2022-12-03 02:02:20] <%FictionK> Special attack is very powerful
[2022-12-03 02:02:22] <%+woopdaritis> @CohhCarnage Your sword level is also super low
[2022-12-03 02:02:26] <$Hidden_Hybrid> it is like one of those sticks with a toy mouse on it for cats
[2022-12-03 02:02:31] <%+wildwookie05> special attack pierce dmg?

[2022-12-03 02:02:53] <Mr_Gen_X> @CohhCarnage Might be wrong, but I think the sword middlemouse attack does peircing
[2022-12-03 02:02:53] <kaifalo> special attack?
[2022-12-03 02:02:53] <+RandyB123> Your axe should do great damage to lox

[2022-12-03 02:04:14] <+swagnatius> is that sword/shield made from black marble or what?
[2022-12-03 02:04:15] <+TheMayhembrother> Like 8-13 hours I think

[2022-12-03 02:05:32] <+IIxRequiem> @cohhcarnage what were your thoughts about Callisto Protocol? Maxamillion put it down after a couple of hours, curious if you felt the same as he did?
[2022-12-03 02:05:36] <+Fenthule> wonder if theres any caves or something here lol
[2022-12-03 02:05:38] <%Moewenfels> @CohhCarnage Thanks to you i finally tried the knifes in Valheim for the first time and i love em ^.^
[2022-12-03 02:05:40] <@%Suzunahara> @Nikosan09 it's a wisp infused sword you can make it Mistlands. It sounds nice on paper, but it's wisp effect is pretty weak so it's not as helpful as the Wisplight
[2022-12-03 02:05:53] <+DCBoldt> @DCBoldt True. I was just curious if he looked at it at all. Thanks!
[2022-12-03 02:05:59] <+The_Fox_Parade> @magpie_74 Is he planning on going back to it?
[2022-12-03 02:06:03] <%Captainkingdog> He did? cohhO I wonder what his issue with it was?

[2022-12-03 02:06:34] <+keikaku_cat> @IIxRequiem thats the thing about opinions, theyre not very reliable on how something really is.
[2022-12-03 02:06:40] <%+magpie_74> if it has a hard difficultie im sure it would take alot longer?
[2022-12-03 02:06:41] <+DCBoldt> @DCBoldt Oh! Did he watch it on stream? I always enjoy the reactions
[2022-12-03 02:06:44] <+skybike123> how did you fix the stuttering issue? Modify the Engine.ini file?

[2022-12-03 02:07:05] <+IIxRequiem> @keikaku_cat I wasn’t saying Max or Cohh were wrong, just asking for his take
[2022-12-03 02:07:07] <%$veger70> @suzunahara So it doesn’t replace the wisp allowing you to wear the belt?

[2022-12-03 07:20:13] <%KVahlman> defensive meaning absorbing damage? Sounds good to me.
[2022-12-03 07:22:11] <%CruseNg> i am not good at parry, nor does a defensive tank sound good. evasive tank? but i would prefer to be an offensive tank. Tho in a party situation, i dont mind being a defensive tank

[2022-12-03 07:23:45] <%CruseNg> being a solo defensive tank just makes one cry since you probably lack dmg

[2022-12-03 07:27:00] <Lil_Ciel> when the evasive can evade magic as well it looks much better than MC
[2022-12-03 07:27:57] <%CruseNg> @Lil_Ciel ah! i am waiting for the 2nd season but for the mc she has an offensive skill tho. Offense has to come from somewhere. She just doesnt want to die tho lol
[2022-12-03 07:28:11] <%CruseNg> @Lil_Ciel NODDERS
[2022-12-03 07:28:15] <Lil_Ciel> in "free life fantasy online' the MC is parry tank. deflecting everything
[2022-12-03 07:28:36] <Lil_Ciel> in the novel she's not so invicible anymore
[2022-12-03 07:28:45] <%CruseNg> mc has a skill that evokes when she is 1hp?
[2022-12-03 07:29:51] <%CruseNg> @Lil_Ciel in anime she was not too invincible at the end too because the game admins are nerfing her and other players are trying to better her

[2022-12-03 07:32:13] <%CruseNg> it was a fun anime to watch
[2022-12-03 07:32:22] <Sazzbot> honestly i dont feel it in path of exile anymore and with 3.20. and it is because it seems there are no fun builds anymore
[2022-12-03 07:32:35] <Lil_Ciel> VoHiYo
[2022-12-03 07:33:28] <Lil_Ciel> @sazzbot need more ways to battle
[2022-12-03 07:34:07] <Lil_Ciel> move boom move boom move boom
[2022-12-03 07:34:18] <Sazzbot> @Lil_Ciel yes.  i dont think GGG realise "builds" is one of their core pillars of PoE and their builds are not so fun anymore
[2022-12-03 07:35:26] <Lil_Ciel> limitation of top down game

[2022-12-03 07:38:04] <%KVahlman> For me, Ruthless might "save" PoE for a while again
[2022-12-03 07:38:54] <%KVahlman> I've come to realize that PoE has evolved past my interest, which is kinda natural for a long-term game. You can see this with WoW and EQ and some other games
[2022-12-03 07:40:04] <Lil_Ciel> do you want to go close and boom. boom from afar. send other to boom for you.
[2022-12-03 07:40:28] <%KVahlman> The core game gets so stale that it either needs a revamp (poe2) or devs start to add silly carneval stuff that has nothing to do with the core game (eg. this roguelike stuff and funny MTX)
[2022-12-03 07:41:01] <%m3rcer> but you can show ppl you failing to 6 link

[2022-12-03 09:08:26] <%KVahlman> What's there to be excited for? A game mode that has nothing to do with PoE? New ways to spend money on MTX?
[2022-12-03 09:09:02] <%Crazytrain334> cohhO
[2022-12-03 09:09:09] <%Crazytrain334> ok sorry i asked

[2022-12-03 09:10:02] <%Yeagher> im not a fan of another out of map mechanic but i do enjoy roguelites so im hopeful
[2022-12-03 09:10:13] <%KVahlman> I'm just not a person who likes when games go from what they are, to a circus designed to entertain broader audience
[2022-12-03 09:10:53] <%KVahlman> And that's what PoE has been doing for a while now, except in Ruthless which is why that's gonna be more interesting to me personally
[2022-12-03 09:11:55] <%KVahlman> It's quite telling when the announcement starts with pre-show of build of the week exhibits and 90% of them is covering the screen with colors with an autobomber
[2022-12-03 09:12:42] <%DanVelly> so you define PoE as it's difficulty?
[2022-12-03 09:12:44] <%KVahlman> But hey, we got a game mode where there's actual game in it, so I'm happy with that

[2022-12-03 09:16:43] <%PazifistTyco> @KVahlman tbf these were re/runs of the ones during last season.. so state of the game rather than direction they are going for

[2022-12-03 09:25:21] <%DanVelly> wait KVahlman ... you're saying you are AGAINST game modes that do not require skill and are just walking simulations but are also against the new game mode that penalises not skillfully dodging enemies?
[2022-12-03 09:25:56] <%KVahlman> No
[2022-12-03 09:26:10] <%KVahlman> I'm not against anything
[2022-12-03 09:26:20] <%Simon_Verhoeven> looks like neither midnight sun or the new dead space like are doing too well
[2022-12-03 09:26:50] <%KVahlman> Simon_Verhoeven technical issues, the bane of recent years
[2022-12-03 09:27:00] <%DanVelly> calling a game mode the opposite of "actual game" isn't being against it?

[2022-12-03 09:27:40] <%KVahlman> Yea, no ini will fix the #stutterstruggle
[2022-12-03 09:29:16] <%PazifistTyco> well... i had to limit darktide to a single thread for it to not constantly crash... so iwould say it IS possible :P

[2022-12-03 09:31:11] <%Simon_Verhoeven> Looking forwards a lot more to rogue trader. Less keen on DT, although happy for those loving it.
[2022-12-03 09:32:16] <%PazifistTyco> I would looooove to play a solo play DT maybe even more than roque.. as it stands currently I agree :)
[2022-12-03 09:32:35] <%KVahlman> What #stutterstruggle specifically refers to is stutters resulting from shader compilation. It will occur every time an effect (or anything that uses a shader) gets displayed/loaded for the first time. The only way to avoid it is to precompile them, either by dedicated loading step (like NMS for example) or splitting it to doing some in one go and rest in the background.
[2022-12-03 09:33:07] <%Simon_Verhoeven> @PazifistTyco to me it doesn't add enough distinction to VT(2), and with everything having ranged it removes some of the uniqueness to me
[2022-12-03 09:33:25] <%PazifistTyco> thats pretty specifiv for a hashtag :) i didnt know that
[2022-12-03 09:34:34] <%KVahlman> It's Alex Battaglia's hashtag for it cohhLUL but yeah, it's quite bad in Callisto Protocol.
[2022-12-03 09:38:28] <%PazifistTyco> yeah the hidden loading screens durign the start of cohhs run were quite obvious cohhMy
[2022-12-03 09:40:25] <%KVahlman> Cohh probably got off easy, since he has a strong CPU. That matters to the severity of the stutters (but can't eliminate it)

[2022-12-03 09:42:27] <%Maldastar52> @Simon_Verhoeven midnight suns is doing a fair bit better than Callisto (if talking about scores)
[2022-12-03 09:43:35] <%Simon_Verhoeven> @Simon_Verhoeven cohhBoop and indeed. And I get that. Midnight sun looks fine, if some special art choices. But the callisto performance...

[2022-12-03 09:58:52] <%PazifistTyco> @KVahlman interesting then that switching to DX11 helped as much.. i was under the impression DX12 should be putting less load on the CPU.. but amybe thats only relative and the absolute load is still higher?
[2022-12-03 09:59:57] <%KVahlman> DX12 spreads the load, DX11 is very single-threaded. But I don't know how the two differ in terms of the shader compilation tbh cohhHmm

[2022-12-03 10:00:46] <%KVahlman> But doesn't DX11 lose RT as well? At least in the PS5 version that DF took an in-depth look at the difference was pretty drastic.
[2022-12-03 10:00:46] <@%^CohhilitionBot> cohhHi KVahlman, you are unique cohhGV
[2022-12-03 10:01:17] <%KVahlman> So in a game where the mood is #1 gameplay mechanic that might be a bad trade-off...
[2022-12-03 10:01:32] <%KVahlman> But RT is a gimmick yadda yadda who cares cohhK
[2022-12-03 10:02:08] <%Maldastar52> Well I think for most its that RT is expensive (for me) due to needing a decent GPU
[2022-12-03 10:02:53] <%KVahlman> That doesn't make it a gimmick, unless you want to specifically convince yourself that it's ok to not have it cohhLUL
[2022-12-03 10:03:29] <%KVahlman> But it's all a matter of taste, at least it's an option and not a requirement mostly
[2022-12-03 10:03:58] <%Maldastar52> I mean I honestly dont really care about RT or not. So yeah. Some games do a great job with it and it does add to the overall product, but its not a deal breaker either and never will be PrideShrug
[2022-12-03 10:04:57] <%KVahlman> For me it is, to the point that I am literally not playing Cyberpunk right now since I can't run it the way I want with my current GPU
[2022-12-03 10:05:36] <%Maldastar52> Thats fine, but you cant sit there and say that people have to "convince" themselves its not ok to not have it
[2022-12-03 10:06:16] <%Maldastar52> RT is a luxury in an already luxury experience in the end. Until games REQUIRE it baseline (I think Metro Exodus RT is the only game so far?)
[2022-12-03 10:06:19] <%KVahlman> I can if people say it's a gimmick
[2022-12-03 10:06:49] <%Maldastar52> It is a gimmick? People seem to have been convinced gimmick = bad
[2022-12-03 10:06:57] <%Maldastar52> but its designed to attract attention
[2022-12-03 10:07:00] <%Maldastar52> RT does that
[2022-12-03 10:08:23] <%KVahlman> Ok, we can agree on that if we agree that shaders are a gimmick too.

[2022-12-03 10:31:38] <%Maldastar52> I mean, I enjoy it and tend to just stop playing when I stop enjoying it
[2022-12-03 10:35:16] <%Spero_Mcgee> so after 1 week then cohhK
[2022-12-03 10:35:59] <%SinocardDragonkin> once u hit dungeons
[2022-12-03 10:37:14] <%everyoneneedscayenne> heyo chat cohhPat
[2022-12-03 10:37:14] <@%^CohhilitionBot> cohhHi cohhMy oh its that hot spicy cayenne
[2022-12-03 10:37:42] <%Vosy1984> I kinda miss messing up with wow server economy LUL
[2022-12-03 10:38:14] <%Maldastar52> Vosy cant do that anymore with regional AH for commodities
[2022-12-03 10:39:01] <%Vosy1984> aww, they made a patch to nerf me?
[2022-12-03 10:39:04] <%Vosy1984> LUL
[2022-12-03 10:39:31] <%Maldastar52> I mean its better for the health of the game when 3 people dont own a realms AH
[2022-12-03 10:40:03] <%Vosy1984> not wrong
[2022-12-03 10:40:34] <%DanVelly> hi everyoneneedscayenne
[2022-12-03 10:41:47] <%KVahlman> Heh, finally decided to upgrade my jetpack in ELEX2, went from nothing to having almost all upgrades and almost halfway to max fuel cohhDerp
[2022-12-03 10:41:47] <%Spero_Mcgee> hasnt it always been messed due to the wow token?
[2022-12-03 10:41:53] <%KVahlman> everyoneneedscayenne Vosy1984 cohhPat
[2022-12-03 10:41:58] <%KVahlman> Spero_Mcgee cohhDap
[2022-12-03 10:42:05] <%Spero_Mcgee> @KVahlman now you can be Ironman cohhPog
[2022-12-03 10:42:07] <%Spero_Mcgee> @KVahlman cohhWaii
[2022-12-03 10:42:34] <%Spero_Mcgee> I think I might pick up Elex 2 during winter sale not sure cohhHmm
[2022-12-03 10:43:02] <%Maldastar52> @Spero_Mcgee Depending on who you ask yes, its an odd one. Because gold buyers will still buy gold from illegal sites etc (and a MUCH higher amount for less $)
[2022-12-03 10:43:03] <%KVahlman> It's much much better now with a bunch of fixes since launch and most importantly DX12 version
[2022-12-03 10:43:23] <%Maldastar52> I should play ELEX 1 at some point since I got it on a deep sale some while back KEKW
[2022-12-03 10:43:27] <%KVahlman> The performance of the DX11 version is just crap
[2022-12-03 10:43:58] <%KVahlman> I stopped playing the second I heard there was DX12 patch in the works, 6 months or whatever later it came and now it's fine for me
[2022-12-03 10:44:19] <%KVahlman> Not good, and still makes me sad in big towns but at least always playable
[2022-12-03 10:44:53] <%KVahlman> It's smelling very much of the case where they wanted to rewrite the engine for the second game but just didn't get all the way there

[2022-12-03 10:50:08] <%Simon_Verhoeven> Is it a case of a bad engine, or just a game a bit ahead of its time requirement wise
[2022-12-03 10:50:47] <%DanVelly> hey Simon_Verhoeven cohhEat
[2022-12-03 10:50:51] <%Spero_Mcgee> probably both

[2022-12-03 10:51:43] <%Spero_Mcgee> @Spero_Mcgee sure but the wow token made it "legal"
[2022-12-03 10:51:50] <%Simon_Verhoeven> I fully get Cohh's reasoning, but I am still weirded out by seeing Garry after so long
[2022-12-03 10:52:41] <%Spero_Mcgee> remove all emotes cohhD

[2022-12-03 10:54:03] <%Spero_Mcgee> Blizz likes it though
[2022-12-03 10:54:30] <%Maldastar52> SinocardDragonkin did they make a new one / trailer for a new one? But to answer the question, they make decent money enough to warrant more
[2022-12-03 10:55:02] <%Spero_Mcgee> Want more money, make more its that simple cohhPuhu
[2022-12-03 10:55:05] <%SinocardDragonkin> Maldastar52 there is a trailer for a new one and i thought they would of dived in popularity
[2022-12-03 10:56:27] <%Maldastar52> Pretty sure all of them so far have made 100mil or greater in movie box office
[2022-12-03 10:56:31] <%Maldastar52> Easy to see why they make em
[2022-12-03 10:56:51] <%Maldastar52> hell Revenge of the Fallen I think made almost half a bil cohhLUL

[2022-12-03 10:58:01] <%Maldastar52> I really enjoyed those games

[2022-12-03 11:21:58] <%Spero_Mcgee> things sure has changed since after mists of pandaria
[2022-12-03 11:22:39] <%Spero_Mcgee> I heard things got worse and worse ever since the wow token. But then you could technically farm gold and have a free sub I think so Im not sure tbh
[2022-12-03 11:22:49] <%Joku212> 100 gold isn't nothing nowdays
[2022-12-03 11:23:12] <%Spero_Mcgee> but I had always heard that over the years people suddenly started earning thousands of gold somehow

[2022-12-03 11:25:39] <%Spero_Mcgee> I more or less heard horror stories about item progression through asmongold. grinding for legandary weapon xp and all that. How the Jailer story made no sense etc etc
[2022-12-03 11:26:11] <%Spero_Mcgee> And I guess Anduin died or something and got possessed

[2022-12-03 11:32:17] <%DanVelly> @Alee_Enn atleast from what he said yesterady
[2022-12-03 11:32:32] <%Spero_Mcgee> @m3rcer yeah they were afraid that the undead would go wild, which never made sense to me. That implied that Arthas kept them back all that time and after Bolvar took over did that as well. Even though there wouldve been still tons of undead across the world
[2022-12-03 11:32:48] <%Alee_Enn> @DanVelly I never gave that as an option!!! Play what I tell you to enjoy or the beatings will continue dammit!!!!

[2022-12-03 11:33:53] <%m3rcer> @Spero_Mcgee in fact that one of the big questions when the trailer first came out was like "so what about all the undead that was being kept in check? do we have another war now?"
[2022-12-03 11:33:53] <%Joku212> @Spero_Mcgee well there was some decisions what came to my mind what made me question: why he or she would make that decision in this expansion too
[2022-12-03 11:33:56] <%Spero_Mcgee> I wonder why cohh didnt continue with Tales of Arise. There probably were other games at the time too. I think he liked it well enough. Or was it also a sponsored stream cohhHmm

[2022-12-03 11:38:19] <%Spero_Mcgee> yes but Tales of A Rize was new at the time. Probably also the best one graphically speaking up to this point in the series

[2022-12-03 12:01:34] <%the__Merowinger> yeah i got that sentece. i was realy pissed about it.
[2022-12-03 12:02:09] <Botamigo> he normaly puts in the title about warnings...
[2022-12-03 12:04:00] <%Spero_Mcgee> doubt that epilepsy warning would fit in the title
[2022-12-03 12:04:03] <%+Foozzie> the camera shake can be reduced i think
[2022-12-03 12:04:09] <%Spero_Mcgee> with all the other stuff typically in it
[2022-12-03 12:04:24] <%+Foozzie> good luck with the flashing lights tho, pretty much deadspace to a T
[2022-12-03 12:04:55] <%aslird> he could easily remove a command that plugs his youtube for the safety of his viewers cohhK

[2022-12-03 12:05:37] <Botamigo> NOPERS
[2022-12-03 12:06:00] <%the__Merowinger> bahroo placed it in front wich absolutly fair at this point. Doodger makes a !warning if there is anything to do so and also puts it up front. i dont think you need to say game title and schedule as most important.

[2022-12-03 13:06:17] <%BlazeRom> "write a code" that's dumb, a script

[2022-12-03 13:17:47] <%Tarquinius1> cohhBot Chat has been motivated
[2022-12-03 13:18:16] <%Archangelm> Lucarkia I asked openAI: If you fail to stop a drill from coming to your face, it is important to remain as still as possible and protect your eyes and face with your hands. If the drill is still spinning, you should wait until it stops before attempting to move away. If the drill has caused any injury, seek medical attention immediately.

[2022-12-03 13:33:17] <%the__Merowinger> @the__Merowinger ok true. but its an non railed invironment.
[2022-12-03 13:33:46] <%BlazeRom> saw from digital foundry that the main issue might be the shaders loading constantly
[2022-12-03 13:33:49] <%Tarquinius1> Well at least its at a decent time cohhPog https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMrwcmG3eqk
[2022-12-03 13:33:56] <%BlazeRom> I would suspect Denuvo is the culprit tho
[2022-12-03 13:34:00] <%JustTeaThankYou> @BlazeRom there is supposedly a patch now for that exact problem
[2022-12-03 13:34:05] <%Spero_Mcgee> denuvo cohhM
[2022-12-03 13:34:11] <%williamwall512> I mean it seemed like it was hallways and rooms in a row. Maybe bigger rooms but still sequential
[2022-12-03 13:34:15] <%Tarquinius1> @BlazeRom its isnt tho
[2022-12-03 13:34:15] <%m3rcer> @BlazeRom ppl say its more likely a UE4 shader problem
[2022-12-03 13:34:17] <%Spero_Mcgee> that alone is reason enough to not install the game then cohhM
[2022-12-03 13:34:40] <%BlazeRom> @Tarquinius1 nice, also excited over BG3 this month
[2022-12-03 13:34:44] <%BlazeRom> hope we get a release date

[2022-12-03 13:38:38] <%Spero_Mcgee> @Spero_Mcgee oof you bought it in early access?

[2022-12-03 13:38:56] <%hrncir9> cohh1Guy cohh1Guy cohh1Guy
[2022-12-03 13:38:58] <%BlazeRom> didn't play much of it tho, I just do this with games I know for sure i'll buy regardless
[2022-12-03 13:39:03] <%Spero_Mcgee> damn why would you selfspoil
[2022-12-03 13:39:08] <%Spero_Mcgee> thats just silly
[2022-12-03 13:39:10] <%BlazeRom> I barely played it
[2022-12-03 13:39:11] <Cereaz> greetings
[2022-12-03 13:39:14] <%Tarquinius1> Yeah, pretty much bought BG3 right when I could
[2022-12-03 13:39:14] <%m3rcer> he wants to taste the sausage as its being made
[2022-12-03 13:39:18] <%Spero_Mcgee> thats even worse
[2022-12-03 13:39:24] <%BlazeRom> in contrast I have 1k hours in D:OS 2
[2022-12-03 13:39:32] <%BlazeRom> so made sense to buy BG3
[2022-12-03 13:39:35] <%Simon_Verhoeven> cohhL m3rcer

[2022-12-03 13:40:01] <%williamwall512> @spero_mcgee some people enjoy watching a game develop don't yuck someone's yum cohhCop
[2022-12-03 13:40:02] <%Tarquinius1> The EA doesnt show most of the content anyways
[2022-12-03 13:40:10] <%Simon_Verhoeven> And I also like snagging some EAs to sponsor the devs if I know ahead it'll be cohhGG
[2022-12-03 13:40:11] <%williamwall512> cohhWow
[2022-12-03 13:40:14] <%Spero_Mcgee> @m3rcer Because you already know the mechanics and start and end of various quests before the full game is finished

[2022-12-03 13:40:41] <%Tarquinius1> They've said that what you see in the first act that is in the EA- isnt all thats gonna be there on release
[2022-12-03 13:40:41] <%Spero_Mcgee> @williamwall512 Dont yuck my yum of criticising others cohhCop
[2022-12-03 13:40:47] <%BlazeRom> I can play D:OS2 blindfolded now, but BG3 is kicking me

[2022-12-03 13:41:17] <%Simon_Verhoeven> @Spero_Mcgee isn't BG3 just a bit of act1? I thought Larian was doing it like the we happy few devs. Mostly an EA without the proper content to test the contents
[2022-12-03 13:41:20] <%BlazeRom> there...are people already who have 1k hours in the EA of BG3
[2022-12-03 13:41:21] <%m3rcer> @Spero_Mcgee idk man seems kinda saying being watching first few episodes of a show ur spoiling yourself cause the show hasnt ended yet

[2022-12-03 13:41:31] <%Tarquinius1> @Simon_Verhoeven yep
[2022-12-03 13:41:31] <%ReggaeSan> DOS2 was hella long in EA
[2022-12-03 13:41:50] <%Spero_Mcgee> @Tarquinius1 That might be the case, but all the story beats would remain the same, the characters you meet remain the same, the quests that are already in remain the same, aside from balance or bugfixes
[2022-12-03 13:41:50] <%BlazeRom> tutorial island is easily 8 hours
[2022-12-03 13:41:54] <%Tarquinius1> @cdpr_lied_to_us its coming after game is released
[2022-12-03 13:41:55] <%BlazeRom> 20 if you have no idea what you're doing

[2022-12-03 13:42:27] <%BlazeRom> D:OS2 had a kickstarter too if I remember right
[2022-12-03 13:42:29] <NeoFoxx000> cohhHi Good morning, Chat! HypeSneak
[2022-12-03 13:42:31] <%BlazeRom> or was that only D:OS?
[2022-12-03 13:42:31] <%Spero_Mcgee> @Spero_Mcgee Was it long in early access though? I dont remember at all
[2022-12-03 13:42:35] <%Tarquinius1> @BlazeRom yup
[2022-12-03 13:42:38] <%elmhing> cohhFA / NeoFoxx000 cohhCheer
[2022-12-03 13:42:44] <%BlazeRom> @Spero_Mcgee about an year or so
[2022-12-03 13:42:45] <%Tarquinius1> @BlazeRom both

[2022-12-03 13:42:53] <%Morphan> cohhHi cohhHi
[2022-12-03 13:42:57] <%williamwall512> @spero_mcgee but from what I have seen the replayability is high because of the amount of different paths
[2022-12-03 13:42:58] <%Spero_Mcgee> @BlazeRom very short then, as it should be
[2022-12-03 13:43:04] <%elmhing> cohhFA / Morphan cohhBoop
[2022-12-03 13:43:07] <@%Suzunahara> @Morphan hey hey cohhL
[2022-12-03 13:43:10] <%+black_scion> Good Morning Chat!! cohhDap
[2022-12-03 13:43:18] <%Simon_Verhoeven> cohhHi black_scion Suzunahara
[2022-12-03 13:43:20] <@%Suzunahara> @black_scion good morning cohhL
[2022-12-03 13:43:22] <%BlazeRom> well, like I mentioned earlier, after D:OS2 came out of EA, it took another year of patches to have it "flawless" @Spero_Mcgee
[2022-12-03 13:43:26] <@%Suzunahara> @Simon_Verhoeven hihi cohhL
[2022-12-03 13:43:29] <Kwellz> @CohhCarnage I'd run it on ps5 if you can, currently seems to be massively better graphics and performance unless you can max it out on pc, especially dx12/lightning options
[2022-12-03 13:43:37] <%Spero_Mcgee> @williamwall512 My point is, if you play so much of it, you might reach a point where you burn out on the game before its even actually finished
[2022-12-03 13:43:42] <GunpukuHimegimi> !time
[2022-12-03 13:43:43] <@%^CohhilitionBot> CohhCarnage's time is currently 7:43 AM EST. The Morning Stream usually starts in 0:17
[2022-12-03 13:43:50] <@%Suzunahara> @Kwellz Cohh found settings changes to make it run fine on PC ^^. he's good
[2022-12-03 13:43:52] <%Simon_Verhoeven> @Kwellz he played yesterday and got it running pretty well
[2022-12-03 13:43:54] <%BlazeRom> @williamwall512 true, it's why I'm not playing it NODDERS
[2022-12-03 13:44:01] <%BlazeRom> I just wanna own it already
[2022-12-03 13:44:04] <%BlazeRom> it's like insurrance
[2022-12-03 13:44:17] <%BlazeRom> no matter what you'll have it when it's ready
[2022-12-03 13:44:17] <GunpukuHimegimi> 17mins until Calisto trickyyPog
[2022-12-03 13:44:20] <%aslird> they also patched the pc version las night, not sure if that fixed the shader issue
[2022-12-03 13:44:20] <Kwellz> @Suzunahara @Simon_Verhoeven did he manage to get it running with dx12 and the subsurface lightning stuff? At leazst I think that's the option
[2022-12-03 13:44:22] <%elmhing> cohhH
[2022-12-03 13:44:27] <Kwellz> Makes a huge difference in atmosphere
[2022-12-03 13:44:28] <%m3rcer> @BlazeRom gotta have that digital copy before them steam keys run out
[2022-12-03 13:44:32] <%Spero_Mcgee> @BlazeRom so technically instead of releasing it shouldve stayed another year in EA, or was that just an overwhelming opinion most users had of the game? cohhHmm
[2022-12-03 13:44:34] <@%Suzunahara> @Kwellz he's running in DX11 and FPS capped to 60 ^^
[2022-12-03 13:44:39] <%JustTeaThankYou> @aslird It's supposed to yes, now it just stutters in the menu instead of in the game :p
[2022-12-03 13:44:40] <Kwellz> aight
[2022-12-03 13:44:44] <%Simon_Verhoeven> @Kwellz dx11 and some other options like 60FPS IIRC
[2022-12-03 13:44:47] <%Tarquinius1> Sony made sure it worked well on PS5- they had 150 devs working on their own side to help make it
[2022-12-03 13:44:59] <%cemei> cohhHi
[2022-12-03 13:44:59] <%BlazeRom> @BlazeRom well, it felt like the most tested part of the game was the starting island, which makes sense since that was in EA, but the rest of the game wasn't.

[2022-12-03 13:45:12] <%Archangelm> Suzunahara cohhHi
[2022-12-03 13:45:14] <%elmhing> cohhFA / cemei cohhBoop
[2022-12-03 13:45:15] <%BlazeRom> @Spero_Mcgee I still remember cohh having a game breaking bug on his first playthrough of D:OS2 on stream
[2022-12-03 13:45:19] <@%Suzunahara> @Archangelm hey hey cohhL
[2022-12-03 13:45:21] <%cemei> @Suzunahara, @elmhing cohhL
[2022-12-03 13:45:22] <%BlazeRom> and it was near the end of the game or so
[2022-12-03 13:45:22] <%JustTeaThankYou> @Tarquinius1 consoles get to precompile shaders because they know the exact hardware, pc not so lucky
[2022-12-03 13:45:32] <%Spero_Mcgee> @BlazeRom you do it for the pre-order bonuses and maybe a cheaper base price if the devs throw that in. If youre going to buy it day 1 release or shortly after anyways theres effectively no difference between pre-ordering or not
[2022-12-03 13:45:36] <%Simon_Verhoeven> @BlazeRom the dragon at the end of the game
[2022-12-03 13:46:02] <%williamwall512> @spero_mcgee I can see that happening if you have 100s of hours in it, but if you spend a bit of time checking out each patch or just love to play everything new each patch. it won't become boring
[2022-12-03 13:46:05] <%Spero_Mcgee> @BlazeRom ah yeah, the devs helped him out right?
[2022-12-03 13:46:13] <%Simon_Verhoeven> @BlazeRom it also helps fund smaller studios, which is what I like to do
[2022-12-03 13:46:16] <%Simon_Verhoeven> @BlazeRom yes
[2022-12-03 13:46:26] <%Vosy1984> "Noun. wair (plural wairs) (obsolete) A plank six feet long and one foot across." cohhRead
[2022-12-03 13:46:27] <%Spero_Mcgee> @williamwall512 thats not how addiction works cohhDerp
[2022-12-03 13:46:44] <%BlazeRom> don't get me wrong I don't pre-order all the time, just few exceptions
[2022-12-03 13:46:58] <%BlazeRom> like ER was an exception cause...I knew i'd like it based on what from soft did so far
[2022-12-03 13:47:03] <%Spero_Mcgee> @BlazeRom I doubt some of these studios can be classified as one of the smaller studios anymore though
[2022-12-03 13:47:10] <%williamwall512> @spero_mcgee well if someone is addicted then they aren't going to stop cohhHmm
[2022-12-03 13:47:11] <%Archangelm> oh my god I asked what the real name of Cohh Carnage is to the openAI bot and it knows WAYTOODANK
[2022-12-03 13:47:15] <%Spero_Mcgee> @BlazeRom same
[2022-12-03 13:47:25] <%Tarquinius1> My only pre-orders right now are BG3 and Everspace 2

[2022-12-03 13:47:51] <%Spero_Mcgee> @Archangelm I mean everyone knows, its public knowledge and his name has been mentioned in articles too
[2022-12-03 13:47:56] <%BlazeRom> with BG3, once I saw the demo and how it pretty much evolved from D:OS2 and had even more freedom, insta-buy
[2022-12-03 13:47:56] <%Simon_Verhoeven> @Archangelm oh certainly, I mostly meant for me funding a smaller studio is also a factor when debating whether to preorder or not
[2022-12-03 13:48:00] <%williamwall512> @archangelm I mean his name is out there on the internet with interviews
[2022-12-03 13:48:11] <%Spero_Mcgee> Id assume articles have permission, but its pretty common to find out real names
[2022-12-03 13:48:17] <%Simon_Verhoeven> It got leaked thanks to an iffy interview
[2022-12-03 13:48:37] <%Spero_Mcgee> @Simon_Verhoeven I mean we already know back in the day through kickstarter its nothing hidden

[2022-12-03 14:10:27] <2greedyy> @CohhCarnage I'd reccomend turning v-sync and blur off for less stutter
[2022-12-03 14:10:28] <%+trippingthedicefantastic> Takes a while for the initial shader library to load and there is no status bar.  Probably will still see some stuttering traversing zones or turning some corner quickly according to reports.
[2022-12-03 14:10:29] <%RemotelySensed> it is def. pretty though!

[2022-12-03 14:12:09] <HitmanStallion> You may want to tone down the difficulty in your playthrough Cohh, enemies become spongier as you go through the game

[2022-12-03 14:12:30] <@%Suzunahara> @Rizako_ they did, and it has helped. but hasn't fixed it entirely
[2022-12-03 14:12:30] <Marvex> @kippeeeeee a bit stuttery with cohhs beast setup so if you have a weaker one you might want to lower settings/wait for performance updates
[2022-12-03 14:12:31] <devilkin20> First playthrough to load all animations LuL
[2022-12-03 14:12:33] <%Tarquinius1> Cohh dev post stated that it will stutter on first load to compile the shaders after that it should run smoothly
[2022-12-03 14:12:33] <%kingsliee> cohhM
[2022-12-03 14:12:35] <ultzor> @CohhCarnage it is called shader compilation, you didn't let it finish precompiling them in the menu, so it is doing it in game
[2022-12-03 14:12:37] <InsulinJunky1113> That camera man
[2022-12-03 14:12:38] <Rizako_> @aslird Oh KEKW

[2022-12-03 14:12:54] <@%Suzunahara> @NemanjaV @grugg_micah85 Cohh's on the hardest one ^^
[2022-12-03 14:12:55] <+thedowjones> combat looks fun.. but dos it get repetitive?
[2022-12-03 14:12:56] <@%Gamingkate> @Mrshilka hi cohhHi
[2022-12-03 14:13:00] <%$CLCWolf> Curious if the much-hyped super fast storage of the nextgen consoles is actually responsible for this. Like epitomized against that so this has issue on slower pc storage
[2022-12-03 14:13:00] <%aslird> @ground_control cohhBoop
[2022-12-03 14:13:00] <megaman_sentinel> fights over is the cameraman okay

[2022-12-03 14:13:00] <%Alakfron> the weird thing about combat for me is how you have no control of the camera while swinging so you get stuck on one enemy
[2022-12-03 14:13:01] <@%Suzunahara> @RustleMyJambles he's on the hardest difficulty ^^
[2022-12-03 14:13:02] <NemanjaV> dang :D
[2022-12-03 14:13:02] <@%Gamingkate> @chumichumi8 cohhHi cohhHi
[2022-12-03 14:13:03] <jmaskell> Jerky camera like watching WWE
[2022-12-03 14:13:05] <SandroSC2> @boilerman__ NODDERS
[2022-12-03 14:13:05] <%+nykezzzzz> the combat seem crazy repetitive
[2022-12-03 14:13:06] <%Wonderous_YOKED_Girth> Did we start over again or did cohh go back a ways? I feel like we were at a different spot when I left at 11am cohhHmm
[2022-12-03 14:13:07] <%+SheepTalk> a little bit niche perhaps, but the one thing that's driving me crazy about the combat is that pop up quick aim reticle thing - the devs went to such lengths to build all the UI into the world organically, and then there's this fithy great reticle pops up that apparently has its own little happy jingle attached to it every time something gets booped on the noggin...
[2022-12-03 14:13:09] <%ninchuka> ultzor why doesnt it say then if its compiling shaders, or force you to wait before the game fully starts
[2022-12-03 14:13:09] <Skysurferz> looks like deadspace
[2022-12-03 14:13:11] <%kakaochen> is everyone ready for some stompy lootings

[2022-12-03 14:13:16] <zzclipzz_h> The camera does look like wwe

[2022-12-03 14:13:25] <%full_thr0ttlekevin> this is dx12
[2022-12-03 14:13:25] <wulfgang71> the game is also using denuvo, which causes stuttering

[2022-12-03 14:13:35] <PistachioIV> @CohhCarnage Shader caching while playing is usually a really really bad idea, it improves fps in the long run, but it ruins the first experiences.

[2022-12-03 14:13:43] <Hellminen> @thedowjones if you just upgrade the kinesis you kill everything in 0.1 seconds and entirely ignore the combat by throwing things out of bounds or impaling it on spikes KEKW you dont need to do combat at all

[2022-12-03 14:37:13] <moneysmell> according to mr. Bahroo the easy way is to: stasis - shoot the leg off - bonk on the ground for instant finisher

[2022-12-03 14:38:25] <CarrotWhisky> @getaglow I would view it as an AA-game personally; it had a rather short dev-time (3 years), and is very linear in nature that it feels kinda budget cnstrained. Your mileage may vary though.
[2022-12-03 14:38:27] <exileUT> is this a new patch today for shader compilation?
[2022-12-03 14:38:27] <moneysmell> -100

[2022-12-03 14:40:23] <%Arielunek> For me it's 2 > 1 > 3
[2022-12-03 14:40:23] <+taaglive> 3 was fun to me, it just went so far out of the real of survival horror and went more action
[2022-12-03 14:40:23] <%Nnavy15> i was the first one to like all the dead space Kappa
[2022-12-03 14:40:23] <LotsOfSixes> @LotsOfSixes thank you)
[2022-12-03 14:40:24] <Janus32> Cohh is correct, the franchise holds up
[2022-12-03 14:40:25] <nathank31> dead space 3 coop?
[2022-12-03 14:40:25] <%+ExGranD> Calisto protocol shud be the actual dead space 3
[2022-12-03 14:40:26] <@%BarryCarlyon> If you have audio desync it's the _whole_ stream thats desync, pause play to fix. Theres a twitch weird going around
[2022-12-03 14:40:26] <+ForTheWiel> @CohhCarnage that's why Valve stops at 2, everyone hates the third

[2022-12-03 14:40:42] <tommyp915> @TheGuider it was literally one of the first games with microtransaction, its justified
[2022-12-03 14:40:42] <%aslird> not a horror game cohhBongos
[2022-12-03 14:40:43] <+Sedgie_> Dead space 3 was a terrible dead space game, but a decent action sci-fi game.
[2022-12-03 14:40:43] <@%Suzunahara> @hazardousplight it is after the patch, yes ^^

[2022-12-03 14:40:46] <+IndieBob> Dead Space 2 is the best IMO
[2022-12-03 14:40:46] <HitmanStallion> Sound is horror
[2022-12-03 14:40:46] <%Arcazua> they're called Dead Space 1 2 3 cause that's how good they are

[2022-12-03 14:42:25] <CarrotWhisky> @RevanIRL It lacked the kind of tension horror that Dead Space is known for. But I think the issue is mainly the story; Calisto takes place during an outbreak, Dead Space takes place in the aftermath of one.

[2022-12-03 14:44:26] <+veitios> what's the stasis?

[2022-12-03 14:44:26] <%Dinger321> There's no "West" in the game title, so chances Cohh will finish it is decently high NODDERS

[2022-12-03 14:56:28] <+Mondaymonkeyxbl> @cohhcarnage Stop going in for hugs during the fight. I think that's hurting your chances.
[2022-12-03 14:56:29] <liief> you did great but you could have dodged the spit they threw at you, the same way you dodge their attacks

[2022-12-03 15:41:55] <%Nimryl> this is basically dead space 4

[2022-12-03 15:42:01] <swordsaint231> @crimsonkking how would you rate it?
[2022-12-03 15:42:01] <%Koori_89> @wiggie2gone my thoughts as well if the game did that differentiation that is such a good coding
[2022-12-03 15:42:02] <%+Sam_Nash> it's the dead space devs
[2022-12-03 15:42:03] <Kekema> thats a good ting for most

[2022-12-03 15:42:21] <goombastomp21> dead space baddies are more varied so far i think

[2022-12-03 15:42:24] <Sloniu6> looks more like Hades to me

[2022-12-03 15:54:01] <%full_thr0ttlekevin> this is the successor to dead space
[2022-12-03 15:54:04] <gOnezZle> @CoinHealer It does not. Pretty much 100% not. They don't have the rights to that.

[2022-12-03 15:54:19] <%Simon_Verhoeven> @Suzunahara @ninchuka true, I was thinking about his launch settings. I hope they push out some more perf patches/tweaks this week
[2022-12-03 15:54:20] <enamr> if the rumor about the patch is true then i feel really bad for the devs... sales will probably take a big hit from those initial reviews
[2022-12-03 15:54:22] <@%Suzunahara> @J_Nunnn no problem cohhL

[2022-12-03 16:00:07] <%Simon_Verhoeven> @Nimryl more like dead space I'd say (same devs)
[2022-12-03 16:00:09] <%ninchuka> Nathaln cohh's enjoying it, I've heard people say its not an amazing game pushing dead space style games forward, but not bad

[2022-12-03 16:00:27] <+ForTheWiel> it's tragic that it got that first impression
[2022-12-03 16:00:27] <train007> that's their business, play stupid games win stupid prizes
[2022-12-03 16:00:27] <HitmanStallion> there was a patch?
[2022-12-03 16:00:27] <Sakkyoku> Combat makes me not want to play the game

[2022-12-03 16:00:31] <@%^CohhilitionBot> @juandyman cohhHi Welcome to the channel! cohhGV Enjoy your stay cohhL
[2022-12-03 16:00:32] <%$Tiny_Goliath> it would have been way better for a lot of ppl
[2022-12-03 16:00:32] <+Sana_Craft> the combat is really weird
[2022-12-03 16:00:32] <%ninchuka> BlackJack999 that wasnt elias
[2022-12-03 16:00:33] <%+Jiinglle> the story is OOOF
[2022-12-03 16:00:33] <Sarsippius> "a mistake was made" famous last words
[2022-12-03 16:00:33] <Icaryon> get back up
[2022-12-03 16:00:33] <%afreak10> combat cluncky for sure
[2022-12-03 16:00:33] <%JustTeaThankYou> this game's horror reminds me of doom 3: a lot of little individually scary things but not really building to a crescendo
[2022-12-03 16:00:34] <EngineerJohn> missed loot
[2022-12-03 16:00:34] <@%Suzunahara> @skalpino performance issues ^^
[2022-12-03 16:00:35] <AirDemon1> I really hate the dodge
[2022-12-03 16:00:35] <+GraniteGargoyle> it looks great
[2022-12-03 16:00:39] <+Br3adl3y> anything behind the movable box?
[2022-12-03 16:00:39] <%Multipedten24> @n7_artemius used to be prisoners and guards
[2022-12-03 16:00:39] <%Sgt__Z> nice, so they did patch it. how's the graphics on your end cohh now that you turned them up?
[2022-12-03 16:00:39] <tommyp915> not everyone has to like a game
[2022-12-03 16:00:39] <AndrewK5688> it looks very slow

[2022-12-03 16:00:39] <instantmax> many do
[2022-12-03 16:00:39] <%$SherlockDom3z> the atmosphere is amazing
[2022-12-03 16:00:39] <yourenext3_67> im ok buying a game with hiccups as long as devs work on it imo.
[2022-12-03 16:00:40] <JudgeGhosst> yeah this is up my alley
[2022-12-03 16:00:40] <%DarkbuilderX> The punchout dodging is really weird
[2022-12-03 16:00:41] <ponez> melee lacks a bit depth rooFeels
[2022-12-03 16:00:41] <+Buterlesstoast> It’s a shame that games release unfinished so typically anymore @cohhcarnage
[2022-12-03 16:00:42] <notgreggy> Makes you wonder if they could do this in a day why didn't they do it before launch lol
[2022-12-03 16:00:42] <%Koori_89> ppl want to hate because they do that
[2022-12-03 16:00:42] <redbeardsteve1> I really dislike playing 3pp.  THat's just me.
[2022-12-03 16:00:42] <diedact5099> Clunky combat in horror games is acceptable
[2022-12-03 16:00:44] <Detrox3> I have heard many people hate the Corridoresque setup, very dumb stealth and the combat.
[2022-12-03 16:00:44] <pakuska> This is 10 times more Janky than dead space combat
[2022-12-03 16:00:44] <%Aronim1980> cohh1Guy
[2022-12-03 16:00:44] <%Flothh> vent @CohhCarnage
[2022-12-03 16:00:45] <mrskeletal31> auto dodge coupled with auto aim the game plays itself
[2022-12-03 16:00:45] <AndrewK5688> like a game u can fall asleep playing
[2022-12-03 16:00:46] <+KINGofTROY_> What did they change? briefly lol @CohhCarnage

[2022-12-03 16:00:48] <Amentur> Missed a vent
[2022-12-03 16:00:48] <Stillglade> it certainly doesn't deserve a 30% score
[2022-12-03 16:00:48] <bob_gray> a bit better but yeah the combat is not to my liking personally
[2022-12-03 16:00:49] <%+GrimEnd> combat being clunky is part of being a horror game
[2022-12-03 16:00:49] <+SilasOfTheLambs> cohh, message from the marketing team, your check is in the mail Kappa
[2022-12-03 16:00:50] <%Arielunek> @CohhCarnage They need to add some sort of loading bar at the begining instead of showing a laggy main menu when the shaders are compiling
[2022-12-03 16:00:50] <Sazzbot> @tripstn seems stutter is fixed a lot
[2022-12-03 16:00:50] <%Simon_Verhoeven> @ninchuka Nathaln from what I've seen it's more a: more of kind of game, and not a leap forward game
[2022-12-03 16:00:51] <+BlackJack999> @ninchuka ah I clearly need to get glasses LUL
[2022-12-03 16:00:51] <%ZanRebel> i love the melee system
[2022-12-03 16:00:51] <itsZeuC> gamers should not reward companies that publish sub-par games and fix them down the line.

[2022-12-03 16:01:26] <yares33> everyone have rights to judge game by themselfs, also keep in mind that most people need to pay for this game and not that small amount

[2022-12-03 16:01:30] <kiefyjoecone> I wonder if that's what led to dead space's demise in the first place. impatient release

[2022-12-03 16:02:30] <Ner234> A horror game with emphasis on combat shouldn't be clunky ...
[2022-12-03 16:02:32] <%Simon_Verhoeven> @crimsonkking is it that short?
[2022-12-03 16:02:32] <+Buterlesstoast> @cohhcarnage it’s a sad experience when many games release broken at launch. Modern gaming has really put a sour taste in many people mouths. Day 1 patches to fix games should NOT be the norm. I honestly never pre-order or buy any games at launch anymore, simply because I don’t want to play an unfinished product.

[2022-12-03 16:02:46] <%Tarquinius1> @Aghamyr I doubt people complaining has any effect at all, more likely its contractual obligations, investors and financial constraints.
[2022-12-03 16:02:48] <%Jormunduur> @Aghamyr hard to say, many deadlines are also made by people who are in offices trying to maximize roi without understanding the impact on sales for buggy releases to meet a deadline

[2022-12-03 16:03:05] <itsZeuC> @Aghamyr it's a min/max thing. The company does not care what I think about their game or how loud I voice my opinion. They just care about my money. So, if gamers buy broken products companies will keep dumping them on gamers

[2022-12-03 16:03:43] <+Ayarai> @BambooShoots I mean there are plenty of legit criticisms about the game, I don't think it is a bad game either but something like 7/10 at best. For example I found it started dragging in the final third and that's saying something for as short game as it is.
[2022-12-03 16:03:43] <thenexuscowboy> when's the stutter patch comin?

[2022-12-03 16:05:14] <%+Nerdandanoob> @Buterlesstoast you dont remember the 90s that much then. games still released buggy or straight broken. the issue was there was no way to fix those games. i do agree though that games shouldnt come out with bugs etc but as with anything a single off line of code can wreck the entire game. a good example was the Aliens game that made the aliens derpy as crap due to a single line of code no one found till years later.

[2022-12-03 16:05:57] <+Demonsaeri> @Nerdandanoob I'd also add that games in the 90s weren't as big as they are now, much less code to have to wade through to find any potential bugs.

[2022-12-03 16:06:01] <%Simon_Verhoeven> @Aghamyr to me it's rude. As a dev I am currently being forced to rush out software in a state I dislike just because they asked us to start development way too late, and guess whose losing out on money/gettting on blame in case of issues...

[2022-12-03 16:06:05] <itsZeuC> @Aghamyr  I get what you are saying. All I am saying is that when I go watch a movie I know for sure that the movie projector wont go up in flames 10 minutes into the screening. We need to uphold game devs to higher standards (well, not game-devs the companies that force game-devs to meet deadlines)

[2022-12-03 16:06:43] <pengun3> I feel like people who comment on this game releasing laggy on pc also forget Elden Ring was also very laggy on pc when it released
[2022-12-03 16:06:46] <+tachankus> this game is so technically impressive, I'm amazed
[2022-12-03 16:06:46] <@%Suzunahara> @honestguyx you crash landed on this moon. The warden took you as a prisoner. Then an infection broke out and everyone started turning into monsters. You're trying to escape with the help of Elias, but it's going so well. Also the person who made you crash is here as well, and she still doesn't like you

[2022-12-03 16:07:02] <@%Aghamyr> itsZeuC well as far a comparison go, if a friend make a mistake you'll probably forgive him as some point and don't hold it against him all his life cohhLUL
[2022-12-03 16:07:06] <Fusioncatalyst> so is there in game lore as to why this guy has a health bar on the back of his neck?

[2022-12-03 16:07:31] <FreeWillTelevision> what can you buy with the money?
[2022-12-03 16:07:33] <+Buterlesstoast> @nerdandanoob I do in fact remember when games in the 90s released with bugs. But it wasn’t nearly as common, also those gsmes didn’t have millions of dollars and multi million dollar studios behind them. I understand that gaming now is more about FPS then anything, but that shouldn’t come at the cost of playability. IMO.

[2022-12-03 16:08:13] <%+Nerdandanoob> @Demonsaeri oh thats also very true. modern game file sizes are MASSIVE compared to then. Heck even in the early 2000s games were still somewhat small. Oblivion was what maybe 10 gigs?

[2022-12-03 16:08:41] <itsZeuC> @Aghamyr of course! The company that took my $70 in exchange for me having their product is not my friend though. Also, it's not like this is the 1st time a game is broken on release. In any case, I do understand where you're coming from. All I am saying is that we should find a way to avoid "no man's sky" things from happening. The way I'm following is that from the perspective of the consumer. I only buy things after the devs actually fix them

[2022-12-03 16:26:47] <%LabMonkey42> @CohhCarnage I mean... your typical septic tank works off of ground water and bacteria...
[2022-12-03 16:26:48] <%Nimryl> theres something else you should know cohh. idk if its a bug... but if you die and go back to a check out. loot disappears. seems like theres a cost to death
[2022-12-03 16:26:50] <%Seldomseen0923> Any truth to being able to buy death cut scenes?

[2022-12-03 16:27:42] <JordanMilly> Would you say that there's fewer jump scares in this than Dead Space Cohh? Seems like the monsters appear right in front of you in plain view 90% of the time.

[2022-12-03 16:28:08] <+Hail_the_beards> i dont get having twitch drops on story heavy games, i would assume that most folks here are paying vicariously through cohh & have little intent on playing themselves, thus rendering any drop useless
[2022-12-03 16:28:08] <@%Suzunahara> @Dutch_Psychedelics there are parts of the game with some bad flashing lights
[2022-12-03 16:28:14] <%Multipedten24> @dutch_psychedelics some sections have rather annoying flashing lights
[2022-12-03 16:28:14] <thomasvalentine31> I like how this game even has Perfect Dodges with a tiny slowdown

[2022-12-03 16:28:26] <Phoeniixx7> @urekmazino1, mostly when facing more than 1 enemy it can get a bit clunky

[2022-12-03 16:28:31] <+ForTheWiel> @JordanMilly they focused more on tension but the tension makes the scares that much better
[2022-12-03 16:28:32] <azalet123> so much easier when they cant block
[2022-12-03 16:28:36] <namelessxiii_> is the telekinesis thingy costs energy or is it unlimited to use???

[2022-12-03 16:28:45] <@%Suzunahara> @namelessxiii_ it costs energy, the blue bar on your neck
[2022-12-03 16:28:47] <+jagddoga5> alright Chat, is Cohh enjoying himself with this game? The reviews are pretty 'eh'
[2022-12-03 16:28:47] <XenthorX> clap clap

[2022-12-03 16:28:51] <h3donistt> that backswing tho
[2022-12-03 16:28:52] <%Sadus> @Skelli_____ its a damnage multiplier
[2022-12-03 16:28:53] <+jabir667> this difficulty just seems to make enemies bullet sponges and make the combat draggy
[2022-12-03 16:28:56] <@%Suzunahara> @Skelli_____ that is a quickshot indicator in combat
[2022-12-03 16:28:56] <%ChunkSnorris> Did the inmate friend die
[2022-12-03 16:28:57] <Sliite> @Skelli_____ Queue for firing with a gun if you want to
[2022-12-03 16:28:58] <IodredOfRohan> @Skelli_____ You can shoot as a finisher to execute them
[2022-12-03 16:28:58] <kaptianlegend> Why isnt this streaming in 4k? Would look wayy better
[2022-12-03 16:28:59] <goombastomp21> aaron judge simulator?
[2022-12-03 16:29:00] <%+hmgirlpopuri> The way that npcs just get grabbed and insta killed but they start throwing punches when they meet the player makes me think of how the deadites always seem to want to punch Ash instead of just insta killing him in Evil Dead
[2022-12-03 16:29:03] <+ForTheWiel> @jagddoga5 don't listen to the reviews

[2022-12-03 16:30:27] <+ForTheWiel> @JordanMilly Oh this game gives me anxiety because i'm always on edge waiting for things to pop off, they really milk you slowly in some parts
[2022-12-03 16:30:28] <%$Relair> not taking loot?
[2022-12-03 16:30:29] <@%Suzunahara> @Malkav0 the money gets you permanent upgrades, so in the long term it makes sense. but short term it can make some fights particularly challenging
[2022-12-03 16:30:30] <%+nediane> Tarquinius1 cohhHug
[2022-12-03 16:30:36] <Sliite> Bad reviews may come from the poor optimisation for PC to be honest, lots of lags on PC
[2022-12-03 16:30:36] <XenthorX> it's bonus content
[2022-12-03 16:30:39] <imjustcosmic> Wee woo monkaS wee woo…
[2022-12-03 16:30:39] <+Araragi298> @ChunkSnorris actually realistic safety feature. Cut the power and the door opens.
[2022-12-03 16:30:40] <crimsonkking> you're in a secret loot area now
[2022-12-03 16:30:40] <Qehnt> You’re not

[2022-12-03 16:30:44] <Qehnt> Its lore
[2022-12-03 16:30:45] <SuperEvilFinn> this game has too much loot to carry @CohhCarnage

[2022-12-03 16:31:27] <Inquisition312> Callipso Protocol is an omage to John Carpenters The Thing, a movie more about paranoia than the alien in it. Watching Cohh get paranoid about what he missed is soo fitting xD
[2022-12-03 16:31:27] <%Multipedten24> @carverebain no

[2022-12-03 16:38:21] <thomasvalentine31> I think for a first playthrough, the Baton is probably the best thing to be upgrading. Guns are probably better used as a supplement to damage via the Quick Snap firing during Melee.

[2022-12-03 16:39:03] <+Araragi298> I think its worth the ammo shooting the tentacles

[2022-12-03 16:44:16] <+Shamrock1178> The warden wanted him alive for some reason
[2022-12-03 16:44:16] <imjustcosmic> He’s a delivery guy? Is this death stranding 2 Kappa
[2022-12-03 16:44:17] <scarecrowjones> boss fight?
[2022-12-03 16:44:21] <Quincy_Arrow> Now he's death stranded Kappa
[2022-12-03 16:44:22] <%cynful3> It's a shame this game doesn't have health packs and injectors, it'd make it a lot easier
[2022-12-03 16:44:22] <Vulture2k> too much loot. boss incoming

[2022-12-03 16:44:37] <%Revanous88> @CohhCarnage I feel like what he was carring was something that cult wanted to work on its research
[2022-12-03 16:44:38] <@%Suzunahara> @irolay3556 it was bad, but they patched it and now it's great ^^
[2022-12-03 16:44:39] <%+DebbStep> Thta's a lot of blood
[2022-12-03 16:44:39] <%Multipedten24> @irolay3556 performance patch fixed a lot

[2022-12-03 16:44:39] <wtking21> @Suzunahara Oh! I thought he had been playing for quite a while! Glad I'm still fairly early.
[2022-12-03 16:44:40] <%Mercz94> we're doing this LULW
[2022-12-03 16:44:40] <+veitios> do we know why they wanted him alive and why they injected him with the stuff?
[2022-12-03 16:44:42] <ZombiAtom> i was making breakfast - what did Cohh spend the 2700 on?
[2022-12-03 16:44:42] <+gummy_joe> so this is like what, dead space?
[2022-12-03 16:44:43] <DetectiveNiko> @CohhCarnage  You made me want to try out Valheim and I am absolutely in love, thanks for the streams

[2022-12-03 16:44:52] <heisen187> This game reminds me of the movie Pandorum
[2022-12-03 16:44:53] <%Nimryl> when I played my audio logs.. it didnt play if I closedthe menu
[2022-12-03 16:44:56] <Quan_San> Like a Minority in the 20th century going to prison
[2022-12-03 16:44:59] <%+taylorsci> Did Cohh leave loot where the officer zombie was standing? Saw a white diamond.
[2022-12-03 16:44:59] <%Nimryl> weird how it works for you

[2022-12-03 17:09:57] <wtking21> @Euther he intends to sell the ammo, so if he shoots it, he cant sell it.
[2022-12-03 17:09:58] <%JinOfMadness> also looked like they die without mutating if they loose both arms before

[2022-12-03 17:11:22] <+calibrojosh10> People should play Signalis while they wait for this game to get fixed. It's the better survival horror game anyway.
[2022-12-03 17:11:26] <Moogles1> why did he reload

[2022-12-03 17:11:58] <ryenard> @qqtenko no they arent. they announced a dlc that will have more animations, but they haven't even started working on it. you can't pay gate something that doesn't exist
[2022-12-03 17:11:58] <%Tarquinius1> @Suzunahara incorrect, buying the dlc will give you nothing, those animations are for future content that doesnt exist yet

[2022-12-03 17:12:51] <DanielmanRO> did the patch fix the game?
[2022-12-03 17:12:51] <%+DragoonLord0> It seems the loot in locker and crates is randomized. The last time he broke open the same crate he got a health injector and this time he got 5 hand cannon ammo.
[2022-12-03 17:12:52] <Ellie_Stark_> Really don't like that the review bombers were all from people who played all of 10-30 minutes

[2022-12-03 17:13:27] <+SuperDoodBro> The thing I hate about review sites is that they've 100% changed reviews based on patches before but it's completely arbitrary what games they do that for. @CohhCarnage

[2022-12-03 17:25:52] <$Kwish123> @CohhCarnage  maybe thats a feature though since the pistol is a module. So if you run out of noirmal pistol ammo and dont reload the shotgun module will be empty as well?

[2022-12-03 17:30:13] <%Tarquinius1> @calibrojosh10 and even ER had major technical issues on PC at launch
[2022-12-03 17:30:13] <+Fenthule> its OP in basically every game lol
[2022-12-03 17:30:13] <SA_Bremen> So steam is like Deadspace and turning a corner to see a big vent in the wall?
[2022-12-03 17:30:14] <Rutgrr> @BambooShoots :)
[2022-12-03 17:30:14] <@%BearlyArcane> @CohhCarnage maybe you missed the room where the pack upgrades were
[2022-12-03 17:30:17] <%cdpr_lied_to_us> no way to upgrade suit or inventory?

[2022-12-03 17:30:24] <Karohemd> How has the performance improved with the patch?
[2022-12-03 17:30:25] <%+llllSUNNYIIII> LUL
[2022-12-03 17:30:28] <%ninchuka> they should've had another jump out then
[2022-12-03 17:30:28] <+justadude41> cohh can you die by just running into the spikewalls?
[2022-12-03 17:30:32] <@%Suzunahara> @Karohemd it is tons and tons better today
[2022-12-03 17:30:33] <%+Jiinglle> @cdpr_lied_to_us later
[2022-12-03 17:30:33] <ZombiAtom> Seems to be rnning smooth - i hear it was suppose to stutter all day on PC @CohhCarnage

[2022-12-03 17:30:34] <Kwellz> COGGERS vegetables PogChamp
[2022-12-03 17:30:36] <crimsonkking> @cdpr_lied_to_us you get a suit later, but just 1
[2022-12-03 17:30:37] <%+AnnaKlura> lol bearlyarcane, that will trigger his loot senses HAHA
[2022-12-03 17:30:37] <+yoshiiftw> Chat is this game really as bad as the reviews are saying? Really wanted to pick this up
[2022-12-03 17:30:38] <%meh_ninja_please> Karohemd its really good now
[2022-12-03 17:30:39] <bntap> dead space?
[2022-12-03 17:30:40] <VPlanida> @Karohemd big good, Cohh is maxed out
[2022-12-03 17:30:41] <Karohemd> @Karohemd Excellent.
[2022-12-03 17:30:44] <joyboy_89_> i love melee with dodging but i probablz should invest more to glove >D
[2022-12-03 17:30:45] <Rutgrr> @lipgloss71 sure :P
[2022-12-03 17:30:45] <%Hese_1> cohhFail no energy
[2022-12-03 17:30:46] <%afreak10> Denied
[2022-12-03 17:30:46] <+calibrojosh10> @Tarquinius1 but that stuff usually gets fixed, boring or bad game design can't be
[2022-12-03 17:30:50] <%SingularOa> @calibrojosh10 not just this year, been like this for atleast a few years imo.
[2022-12-03 17:30:51] <%cdpr_lied_to_us> Jiinglle crimsonkking thanks!
[2022-12-03 17:30:51] <%+hmgirlpopuri> It's kind of weird from a game design perspective because resource and inventory management is a big part of survival horror but your main attacks seem to be melee which is an unlimited resource
[2022-12-03 17:30:51] <%Astorma> Copiously placed spike walls, just like in Dark Messiah cohhFee
[2022-12-03 17:30:52] <@%Suzunahara> @yoshiiftw the performance issues are patched ^^
[2022-12-03 17:30:52] <+taaglive> still liked dead space 1's where you could take the limbs off dead enemies and impale the others with it. Haven't seen something like that in this
[2022-12-03 17:30:53] <Bryantheart> no telekinesis for you LUL
[2022-12-03 17:30:53] <Vulture2k> we need that recharge
[2022-12-03 17:30:54] <pie_licker> @CohhCarnage the worse thing is he should have use the inmate clothes as a  bagpack

[2022-12-03 17:50:29] <%BlazeRom> ijpHMM
[2022-12-03 17:50:30] <%BlazeRom> I wonder
[2022-12-03 17:50:37] <%BlazeRom> are there like, fake book covers
[2022-12-03 17:50:48] <%WestSeeking> ???
[2022-12-03 17:50:50] <%+BadWolfCorp> It's ok, just don't do any quotes and then you can't be quoted, but don't quote me on that.
[2022-12-03 17:50:56] <%BlazeRom> I got a metal book that's just a storage, so hollow inside
[2022-12-03 17:51:01] <%cdpr_lied_to_us> BadWolfCorp cohhSus
[2022-12-03 17:51:02] <%+Altheion> Anybody know if Cohh and family are okay?
[2022-12-03 17:51:12] <%Tarquinius1> why wouldnt they be?
[2022-12-03 17:51:13] <%BlazeRom> I wonder if I could give it a book cover to make it feel like a real book
[2022-12-03 17:51:22] <%WestSeeking> "It's ok, just don't do any quotes and then you can't be quoted, but don't quote me on that.", @BadWolfCorp
[2022-12-03 17:51:50] <%+Altheion> @Tarquinius1 Because Cohh generally don't vanish for long periods of time.
[2022-12-03 17:52:06] <%WestSeeking> Why don't just buy a real book. cohhThink
[2022-12-03 17:52:16] <%WestSeeking> cohhHmm
[2022-12-03 17:52:17] <%Tarquinius1> Huh, he hasnt?
[2022-12-03 17:52:20] <%+nediane> Altheion eh? when did they vanish?
[2022-12-03 17:53:03] <@%nuuriell> It's Saturday; he takes Saturday afternoons off.
[2022-12-03 17:53:08] <@%nuuriell> Nobody vanished.
[2022-12-03 17:53:08] <@%Suzunahara> if anything today was the opposite of vanishing. Laina was on stream for a bit this morning
[2022-12-03 17:53:18] <%+Altheion> Oh nvm, my stream wasn't updating properly, haha sorry about that!

[2022-12-03 17:57:35] <%Tarquinius1> TGA will be interesting
[2022-12-03 17:57:49] <%Tarquinius1> Many new games and release date announcments
[2022-12-03 17:57:51] <%ninchuka> cohhHmm 5 days for TGA right?
[2022-12-03 17:57:54] <%BlazeRom> it will be interesting for all the wrong reasons, like not the awards
[2022-12-03 17:57:58] <%Tarquinius1> yes
[2022-12-03 17:57:58] <%BlazeRom> but the announcements KEKW
[2022-12-03 17:58:10] <%Tarquinius1> Nobody cares about the awards
[2022-12-03 17:58:15] <%BlazeRom> the awards will straight up feel like an ad break
[2022-12-03 17:58:24] <%cdpr_lied_to_us> COPIUM BioWare Dreadwolf or new Mass Effect
[2022-12-03 17:58:36] <%BlazeRom> I am not looking forward to Dreadwolf
[2022-12-03 17:58:44] <%ninchuka> yeah some of the games nominated for awards are dumb KEKW
[2022-12-03 17:58:46] <%Tarquinius1> @cdpr_lied_to_us Youll get Jedi Survivor

[2022-12-03 18:00:06] <%Tarquinius1> Essentially what is known: Jedi Survivor, Diablo 4, FFXVI will get release dates at TGA
[2022-12-03 18:00:20] <%cdpr_lied_to_us> Fallen Order was okay imo cohhBongos people hyped it up, because it was the only star wars game without massive problems in like 5 years
[2022-12-03 18:00:23] <%BlazeRom> possibly BG3 too
[2022-12-03 18:00:29] <%+nediane> fingers crossed for Dreadwolf, cohh's playthrough got me hyped
[2022-12-03 18:00:41] <%BlazeRom> @cdpr_lied_to_us exactly
[2022-12-03 18:00:49] <%BlazeRom> it was...a good single player Star Wars game
[2022-12-03 18:00:51] <%ninchuka> I enjoyed FO but damn one bit annoyed me cohhLUL
[2022-12-03 18:00:55] <%BlazeRom> a rarity
[2022-12-03 18:01:15] <%cdpr_lied_to_us> I would rather call it average single player game in the star wars universe
[2022-12-03 18:01:22] <%ninchuka> when he got a double bladed lightsaber it wasnt part of the story NotLikeThis
[2022-12-03 18:01:34] <%BlazeRom> if you compare to Kotor and the likes
[2022-12-03 18:01:36] <%BlazeRom> yeah I get it
[2022-12-03 18:01:45] <%BlazeRom> it could have been more
[2022-12-03 18:01:47] <%ninchuka> like his master used a double bladed lightsaber how was that not part of the story, or like a cut scene
[2022-12-03 18:01:55] <%ninchuka> cohhHmm or was it a cut scene
[2022-12-03 18:02:04] <%Tarquinius1> @BlazeRom nah BG3 wont be at TGA, they got separate event on the 14th
[2022-12-03 18:02:12] <%BlazeRom> ah ok
[2022-12-03 18:02:25] <%ninchuka> cohhLUL that triggers me way too much for some reason and my friend was confused about that
[2022-12-03 18:02:59] <%BlazeRom> @ninchuka made me realize I forgot most of the story
[2022-12-03 18:03:10] <%ninchuka> I remembe bits and pieces
[2022-12-03 18:03:22] <%BlazeRom> I only vaguely remember him getting the option of wielding a double bladed saber later on
[2022-12-03 18:03:23] <%ninchuka> but yeah a very average single player star war game
[2022-12-03 18:03:23] <%cdpr_lied_to_us> I only remember a lot of backtracking and you can explore, you need this ability
[2022-12-03 18:03:24] <%Joku212> xXxRevanxXx poarapPAT angels80Headapt

[2022-12-03 18:03:39] <%cdpr_lied_to_us> Ending was great NODDERS
[2022-12-03 18:03:44] <%BlazeRom> @cdpr_lied_to_us well yeah they went the God of War route
[2022-12-03 18:04:02] <%BlazeRom> the moment that guy showed up at the end was 10/10 yes
[2022-12-03 18:04:14] <%BlazeRom> "Welp, time to run"
[2022-12-03 18:04:26] <%+nediane> BlazeRom next BG3 panel from hell info - https://twitter.com/larianstudios/status/1598014079527944195
[2022-12-03 18:04:29] <%ninchuka> KEKW I never beat the last boss
[2022-12-03 18:04:35] <%cdpr_lied_to_us> BlazeRom but god of war has dialogue during that stuff. Also searching for new lightsaber parts or ponchos is stupid, if they don't do anything
[2022-12-03 18:04:54] <%BlazeRom> well we only had a droid as a companion
[2022-12-03 18:05:05] <%BlazeRom> so it would just be him talking to beeps and boops
[2022-12-03 18:05:08] <%Tarquinius1> @cdpr_lied_to_us yeah, those cosmetics were pointless
[2022-12-03 18:05:18] <%Tarquinius1> Def hope next game has more depth
[2022-12-03 18:05:18] <%BlazeRom> and oh god the ponchos were ugly KEKW
[2022-12-03 18:05:27] <%BlazeRom> but I really appreciated that there were 0 micro's
[2022-12-03 18:05:43] <%Tarquinius1> Like anything you collect- weapon or clothing should have some impact
[2022-12-03 18:05:46] <%BlazeRom> that's how you can tell it was new untested territory for them
[2022-12-03 18:05:58] <%BlazeRom> they had no idea how people would react to it
[2022-12-03 18:06:01] <%cdpr_lied_to_us> True. It was a good first step and I'm excited what they do now cohhSip
[2022-12-03 18:06:12] <%BlazeRom> they will probably add microtransactions to it
[2022-12-03 18:06:44] <%cdpr_lied_to_us> I just want a star wars game where i can be a baddie cohhEvil
[2022-12-03 18:06:58] <%Tarquinius1> I mean, according to info, it started off as a soulslike game and only got turned into a SW game midway into development
[2022-12-03 18:07:04] <%BlazeRom> Kotor 2 was that, kind of
[2022-12-03 18:07:14] <%cdpr_lied_to_us> Yeah, i mean a newer game.
[2022-12-03 18:07:24] <%BlazeRom> Kotor remake COPIUM
[2022-12-03 18:07:29] <%$ground_control> most strategy game based on starwars have an empire campaign, also tie fighter
[2022-12-03 18:07:33] <%Tarquinius1> KOTOR = the cursed IP

[2022-12-03 18:08:32] <%cdpr_lied_to_us> ground_control best campaign was still the old Battlefront 2 NODDERS
[2022-12-03 18:08:49] <%BlazeRom> what about dem from soft rumors

[2022-12-03 18:10:42] <%ninchuka> cohhHmm is the KOTR remake still under the lead of someone who hates star wars?
[2022-12-03 18:10:45] <%Tarquinius1> @BlazeRom at this point I dont want a PC port of a 2015 game, they need to Remaster it first
[2022-12-03 18:10:45] <%cdpr_lied_to_us> ground_control i dislike most of what they do. But what exactly? ratJAM
[2022-12-03 18:10:46] <%ninchuka> and something else
[2022-12-03 18:11:10] <%$ground_control> @cdpr_lied_to_us everything in that last battlefront game deserved hate
[2022-12-03 18:11:26] <Sazzbot> EA is dead to me
[2022-12-03 18:11:28] <%cdpr_lied_to_us> ground_control not everything. The multiplayer was fun imo
[2022-12-03 18:11:38] <Sazzbot> BattleBit is what i will get
[2022-12-03 18:11:46] <%$ground_control> @cdpr_lied_to_us multiplayer is always fun against your friend
[2022-12-03 18:11:49] <%Tarquinius1> @ninchuka it never was, it was rubbish
[2022-12-03 18:12:01] <%$ground_control> like it's not like they deserve credits for that
[2022-12-03 18:12:02] <%BlazeRom> @Tarquinius1 it doesn't need much to look good tbh

[2022-12-03 18:12:27] <%ninchuka> Tarquinius1 the bit about the person in charge of the KOTR remake hating star wars?
[2022-12-03 18:12:29] <%cdpr_lied_to_us> ground_control but it felt like your a stormtrooper or a rebel in a big fight NODDERS
[2022-12-03 18:12:43] <%cdpr_lied_to_us> So it was great for a star wars fan
[2022-12-03 18:13:17] <%Tarquinius1> @ninchuka both wrong, was never in charge or even a lead, plus the rest wasnt true either

[2022-12-03 18:13:48] <%ninchuka> source? I remember seeing alot of articles about it
[2022-12-03 18:14:21] <%Tarquinius1> @ninchuka misleading rubbish taking out of context social media posts for clickbait

[2022-12-03 18:16:05] <Sazzbot> coffee and bacon is bad
[2022-12-03 18:16:12] <%BlazeRom> do you dip your bacon in the coffee?
[2022-12-03 18:16:27] <%+nediane> Snowman_Sir donuts and tea?
[2022-12-03 18:16:41] <%$oddknight> @Tarquinius1 i think thats just people being sensitive to that kind of stuff ever since disney botched the star wars movies

[2022-12-03 18:17:38] <%BlazeRom> I will never understand why they decided to retcone/trash the old lore in star wars
[2022-12-03 18:17:49] <%Simon_Verhoeven> @BlazeRom I saw an advertisement for bacon flavoured coffee cohhDerp
[2022-12-03 18:17:54] <%$oddknight> so they can make their lore , their books etc
[2022-12-03 18:17:59] <%Tarquinius1> @oddknight as if they didnt do the before disney cohhT
[2022-12-03 18:18:08] <%Simon_Verhoeven> Copyright/licensing reasons I'd wagger
[2022-12-03 18:18:10] <%$oddknight> @Tarquinius1 it wasnt nowhere close to this bad for sure
[2022-12-03 18:18:11] <%BlazeRom> @BlazeRom why do my jokes become reality
[2022-12-03 18:18:13] <%BlazeRom> Sadge
[2022-12-03 18:18:23] <%Simon_Verhoeven> And there is even already talks of retconning some of the new content cohhLUL
[2022-12-03 18:18:36] <Sazzbot> cohhStab

[2022-12-03 18:19:09] <%cdpr_lied_to_us> I hated the microchip idea from Clone wars. They being the perfect soldier and just following orders is just better cohhBongos

[2022-12-03 18:19:21] <%ninchuka> cohhHmm mainliners?
[2022-12-03 18:19:43] <%Simon_Verhoeven> @ninchuka aka the non spinoffs like rogue one
[2022-12-03 18:19:50] <%Simon_Verhoeven> @cdpr_lied_to_us they kept that idea in the bad bunch
[2022-12-03 18:19:57] <%Tarquinius1> Because its made up by different people at different times, there are plotholes and nonsense all around, fitting new stuff in to make it all make sense is harder then just retconning some stuff out
[2022-12-03 18:20:00] <%BlazeRom> eh, instead of building off what they have they'd prefer to just burn it to the ground
[2022-12-03 18:20:17] <%BlazeRom> I bet Disney also wants it to be kiddie friendly so they can market it
[2022-12-03 18:20:18] <%cdpr_lied_to_us> Simon_Verhoeven cool! I like that idea a lot more NODDERS
[2022-12-03 18:20:26] <%BlazeRom> Andor is great tho
[2022-12-03 18:20:34] <%$oddknight> theyre gonna have to put out a new star wars movie at some point and if its bad, theyre gonna have a REAL bad time LUL
[2022-12-03 18:20:48] <%BlazeRom> they received plenty of flak for the last one
[2022-12-03 18:21:03] <%$oddknight> thats why theyre just doing series right now
[2022-12-03 18:21:20] <%$oddknight> but its gonna get much worse if they dont put out bangers LUL
[2022-12-03 18:21:24] <%BlazeRom> "ah yes, this ancient knife has the same outline of a wrecked starship somehow, that's where we have to go"
[2022-12-03 18:21:28] <%Simon_Verhoeven> I still need watch andor/bobba fett/...
[2022-12-03 18:21:50] <%Tarquinius1> At least they are producing actual content, not like the draught of nothing at all for the previous decade
[2022-12-03 18:22:14] <%$oddknight> i mean sure , but it aint good content
[2022-12-03 18:22:26] <%Tarquinius1> Some of it is
[2022-12-03 18:22:28] <%BlazeRom> well not all of it, but Mandalorian and Andor I like
[2022-12-03 18:22:41] <%BlazeRom> didn't watch Bobba Fett yet
[2022-12-03 18:22:45] <%BlazeRom> Obi Wan made me yawn
[2022-12-03 18:22:47] <snarkbit> star wars has been full of stuff that doesn't make sense since the first movie. people just see it in the new movies and not in the old.
[2022-12-03 18:23:11] <%Simon_Verhoeven> the only new series I watched is mandalorian and the bad bunch
[2022-12-03 18:23:16] <%Spero_Mcgee> @BlazeRom I only watched the scene where he fought Darth Vader that was nice
[2022-12-03 18:23:35] <%BlazeRom> that's the problem I have with some of these people making movies, they don't have to explain everything
[2022-12-03 18:23:59] <%BlazeRom> even in the prequels, the moment they explained the force as "midichlorians" you had to eyeroll
[2022-12-03 18:24:01] <%Tarquinius1> Yeah, the final episode was really good
[2022-12-03 18:24:02] <%Spero_Mcgee> well ofc, new viewers arent going to know who obi wan is cohhK
[2022-12-03 18:24:48] <%BlazeRom> "What does the scouter say about his midichlorian levels?" "It's over 9000!!!"
[2022-12-03 18:25:15] <%Simon_Verhoeven> @BlazeRom the moment the premise of a series is based on a deus ex machina I didn't expect too much consistency wise
[2022-12-03 18:25:17] <%Spero_Mcgee> tbf midochlorians probably got referenced a lot more in the books. Iirc it had something to do with Darth Plaguies who more or less created Anakin having so much, or something along those lines
[2022-12-03 18:25:29] <%Spero_Mcgee> it was an easy metric to determine that hes the chosen one
[2022-12-03 18:25:55] <%Spero_Mcgee> although ultimately there was no balance either way LUL
[2022-12-03 18:26:05] <%Tarquinius1> @Spero_Mcgee Also Retconned
[2022-12-03 18:26:15] <%BlazeRom> I would have hoped with the new movies they would dwelve into Grey Jedi's being a thing
[2022-12-03 18:26:17] <%BlazeRom> which they kind of tried?
[2022-12-03 18:26:24] <%BlazeRom> but felt like they gave up on that idea in the end
[2022-12-03 18:26:25] <%Simon_Verhoeven> Besides, the movies weren't even consistent within themselves, why do you expect consistency in the series?
[2022-12-03 18:26:34] <%Spero_Mcgee> I always figured since we saw the OG star wars first that Luke was the implied chosen one
[2022-12-03 18:26:39] <%Spero_Mcgee> but w/e tbh
[2022-12-03 18:27:03] <%Tarquinius1> Its as if the different directors made it up as they went with each movie and there was no actual story arc
[2022-12-03 18:27:17] <%Spero_Mcgee> @BlazeRom thats something George Lucas mightve done
[2022-12-03 18:27:35] <%Spero_Mcgee> The only good thing out of disney, is the clone wars cartoon Id say
[2022-12-03 18:27:41] <%Spero_Mcgee> and Rebels maybe?
[2022-12-03 18:27:43] <%Simon_Verhoeven> @Tarquinius1 didn't even need to be different things, how often didn't lucas change things in his edits of the same movie cohhLUL
[2022-12-03 18:27:54] <%BlazeRom> oh yes, Clone wars looked good
[2022-12-03 18:28:19] <%$oddknight> didnt clone wars come out before disney bought them? thought disney only put out the last season of it
[2022-12-03 18:28:19] <%Spero_Mcgee> Well yeah Tarq there were 2 directors after all LUL
[2022-12-03 18:28:32] <%Spero_Mcgee> not sure tbh its been ages
[2022-12-03 18:28:34] <%Tarquinius1> @oddknight yes
[2022-12-03 18:28:58] <%$oddknight> roger cohhGG
[2022-12-03 18:29:20] <%Spero_Mcgee> then only Rebels is the good thing theyve done? cohhD
[2022-12-03 18:29:44] <%Tarquinius1> Anyways just fluff it all, watch it and enjoy, dont try to make sense or think on it- youll just confuse yourself with nonsense that doesnt make sense feel sad about realizing it
[2022-12-03 18:29:49] <%$oddknight> animation wise? yea, series wise i guess theyre 2 good ones 2 stinkers

[2022-12-03 18:31:15] <%BlazeRom> NODDERS
[2022-12-03 18:31:40] <%cdpr_lied_to_us> But Han shot first cohhBongos
[2022-12-03 18:32:11] <%Tarquinius1> @cdpr_lied_to_us which is why he lived
[2022-12-03 18:32:26] <%BlazeRom> the other guy shot first but missed cohhBongos
[2022-12-03 18:32:58] <%Tarquinius1> More like it was a death spasm triggerpull
[2022-12-03 18:33:32] <%cdpr_lied_to_us> Greedo was secretly in love with Han, so he couldn't shot him. Han noticed that and married him. Luke and Obi-Wan never could reach Leia and that's how the rebellion died cohhBongos
[2022-12-03 18:34:24] <%BlazeRom> Han had to shoot him actually cause he always ran...Solo
[2022-12-03 18:34:28] <%Spero_Mcgee> If I want nothing to make sense Ill watch anime
[2022-12-03 18:34:29] <%BlazeRom> cohhBongos
[2022-12-03 18:34:55] <%cdpr_lied_to_us> BlazeRom cohhStare
[2022-12-03 18:35:14] <%Spero_Mcgee> Sounds like a good ending to me
[2022-12-03 18:35:41] <%Tarquinius1> @cdpr_lied_to_us but it wasnt all that bad, as a few years later the aged Palpatine retired and left the Empire to Grand Protector Jar Jar and everyone lived happily ever after cohhT
[2022-12-03 18:35:44] <%Spero_Mcgee> When you look at things, aside from the power control. The empire probably was kinda peacefull and a good employer
[2022-12-03 18:35:57] <%Spero_Mcgee> What happens with the rebelion having beaten the empire
[2022-12-03 18:36:15] <%cdpr_lied_to_us> Tarquinius1 perfect ending KEKW
[2022-12-03 18:36:37] <%Spero_Mcgee> Excuse you? Everyone knows Jar Jar is the true Sith Lord
[2022-12-03 18:37:28] <%Spero_Mcgee> No being can be that unlucky and survive many dangerous situations if it wasnt thanks to the force cohhD
[2022-12-03 18:37:32] <%BlazeRom> I mean, if you look deep enough in the Empire and Rebellion, you'd just say "Screw this" and go live alone on some random self sufficient planet not in control by either of them
[2022-12-03 18:37:47] <%BlazeRom> ....which actually some characters did in-universe now that I think about it
[2022-12-03 18:38:04] <%Spero_Mcgee> Being neutral didnt work out too well as was shown in the Clone Wars cartoons
[2022-12-03 18:38:43] <%Tarquinius1> @BlazeRom and then a bunch bandits come to town
[2022-12-03 18:39:07] <%BlazeRom> well, depending on the planet, you'd hope you have a good hidey hole
[2022-12-03 18:39:09] <%Spero_Mcgee> and Tales of the Jedi, showed that there were corrupt republic governors
[2022-12-03 18:39:23] <%Spero_Mcgee> it really showcased Dookus fall as a jedi
[2022-12-03 18:39:29] <%Tarquinius1> I mean really the best life was on the inner core imperial world
[2022-12-03 18:39:34] <%Spero_Mcgee> ^
[2022-12-03 18:39:43] <%Spero_Mcgee> especially if you were in the military
[2022-12-03 18:39:48] <%Tarquinius1> They had the good life and lacked for nothing
[2022-12-03 18:39:53] <%Spero_Mcgee> assuming you didnt run into darth vader
[2022-12-03 18:39:58] <%Spero_Mcgee> youd probably be dead
[2022-12-03 18:40:22] <%Tarquinius1> He was just one person, odds of it happening were low
[2022-12-03 18:40:30] <%Tarquinius1> Big galaxy
[2022-12-03 18:40:32] <%Spero_Mcgee> if you take away the whole dictatorship angle, the empire is pretty great
[2022-12-03 18:41:02] <%BlazeRom> knowing my luck, no galaxy is big enough to keep me away from showing up in front of Vader cohhBongos
[2022-12-03 18:41:06] <%Spero_Mcgee> unless rebels showed up on your planet LUL
[2022-12-03 18:41:10] <%Spero_Mcgee> rip governors
[2022-12-03 18:41:25] <%cdpr_lied_to_us> My favorite quote about the Jedi and sith conflict: The Jedi, the Sith, you don't get it do you? To the Galaxy, they're the same thing. Just men and women with too much power, squabbling over religion while the rest of us burns. cohhBongos

[2022-12-03 18:51:02] <%Spero_Mcgee> the point was is that not everyone knows everything thats supposedly common knowledge. If you havent learned from somewhere you wouldnt know

[2022-12-03 19:29:04] <%bros402> got blood drawn yesterday and my counts are still funny neutrophils (immune cells) are still unexpectedly high and my managing oncologist has no explanation why, since this hasn't been seen in anyone else on this drug
[2022-12-03 19:29:08] <%+nediane> bohhbongos should totally be a thing

[2022-12-03 19:32:05] <%+GATORS_Vi> @Simon_Verhoeven so stoked you helped me when you did. After you built it and I got all the other stuff worked out for shipping i placed the order. 10 minutes later parts we put on it werent available anymore. so im guessing we got the last ones.
[2022-12-03 19:32:08] <%+nediane> fun cohhM
[2022-12-03 19:32:38] <%Simon_Verhoeven> @Tarquinius1 I know, I am looking forwards to the movie next year about it
[2022-12-03 19:33:25] <%Simon_Verhoeven> @GATORS_Vi I was honestly worried about the GPU combined with the pre christmas delivery. You likely snagged just about the last one

[2022-12-03 19:40:50] <%+GATORS_Vi> @Archangelm i hope so
[2022-12-03 19:41:11] <%Simon_Verhoeven> @Tarquinius1 I'd say that's in the eye of the beholder, the hope is to have it last for years and still keep things running smoothly.
[2022-12-03 19:41:21] <%Simon_Verhoeven> Rather than swapping out the GPU or akin in 2 years.
[2022-12-03 19:41:41] <%+GATORS_Vi> I dont want to have to do this for another 10 years
[2022-12-03 19:41:49] <%Tarquinius1> @Simon_Verhoeven sure, but you dont need the absolute top end for that
[2022-12-03 19:42:05] <%Tarquinius1> Doubt it will last 10 years
[2022-12-03 19:42:11] <%+GATORS_Vi> @Tarquinius1 I gave @Simon_Verhoeven  a budget and he killed it
[2022-12-03 19:42:11] <%Simon_Verhoeven> ofcourse, but he also wants to tinker with other things
[2022-12-03 19:42:51] <%ninchuka> yeah I doubt it would last 10 years but it should easily last like 3 or 4
[2022-12-03 19:43:30] <%ninchuka> GATORS_Vi building it yourself or getting it built by someone else?
[2022-12-03 19:43:41] <%+GATORS_Vi> @ninchuka someone else
[2022-12-03 19:43:46] <%ninchuka> cohhO
[2022-12-03 19:43:58] <%Archangelm> 10 years is a stretch unless the progression of power just stops, but should be really good for 4 years cohhNotes
[2022-12-03 19:44:10] <%ninchuka> make sure the 4090 power connector is full in cohhLUL

[2022-12-03 19:44:52] <%Archangelm> put it in hard and then another push cohhBoom
[2022-12-03 19:44:54] <%+GATORS_Vi> @ninchuka i saw that. crazy they catch on fire

[2022-12-03 19:45:00] <Sazzbot> no. 10 year might be possible
[2022-12-03 19:45:04] <%ninchuka> Simon_Verhoeven well the ones that came with it were proper
[2022-12-03 19:45:07] <%Simon_Verhoeven> And actually it wasn't due to not being fully pushed in
[2022-12-03 19:45:15] <%ninchuka> wasnt it?
[2022-12-03 19:45:22] <Sazzbot> we are entering global recession next year. also global inflation has been going on for a few months now
[2022-12-03 19:45:29] <%ninchuka> I thought thats what tech jesus and nvidia were saying it was
[2022-12-03 19:45:38] <%Astorma> Infinite growth! cohhBoom
[2022-12-03 19:45:40] <%Archangelm> not being pushed in completely was still fine, problems start when it's also pushed to the side
[2022-12-03 19:45:47] <%ninchuka> cohhO
[2022-12-03 19:45:47] <%Simon_Verhoeven> there have been so many things
[2022-12-03 19:45:52] <+Manaron> peepoHappy  TeaTime
[2022-12-03 19:45:57] <Sazzbot> if chinas. IF chinas strikes continues. then it will get worse
[2022-12-03 19:46:00] <%Tarquinius1> Yep the issue was not fully in and twisted
[2022-12-03 19:46:01] <%+GATORS_Vi> @Sazzbot you hit the nail on the head the.
[2022-12-03 19:46:23] <%ninchuka> so kinda still related since if it was in fully it would have mattered if it was pushed to the side cohhSip
[2022-12-03 19:46:37] <%Simon_Verhoeven> the latest update was some manufacturers skimped on the lines/soldering which caused too much power over fewer lines after some sideways twisting
[2022-12-03 19:46:50] <%Tarquinius1> And having a different cable doesnt matter btw
[2022-12-03 19:47:10] <%Tarquinius1> The doesnt exist good cable that wouldnt have the problem if not plugged properly
[2022-12-03 19:47:26] <%Simon_Verhoeven> even when having it fully pulled in you have some sideways movement
[2022-12-03 19:47:49] <%Archangelm> cohhBlush
[2022-12-03 19:48:26] <Sazzbot> @GATORS_Vi supply might dwindle and cost will stay high. but i could very super wrong

[2022-12-03 19:48:59] <%Archangelm> multiple major brands cohhO ? cohhLUL

[2022-12-03 19:49:49] <%Tarquinius1> Here is the vid about the cable, they actually managed to replicate the issue and it happened with every single cable regardless of who manufactored it

[2022-12-03 19:56:17] <%+GATORS_Vi> ive been looking out the window for and nothing. soon as i sit down the sound is back. @ninchuka is that really you
[2022-12-03 19:56:39] <%Tarquinius1> Essentially while manufacturing defects may have a minor impact in making it melt more likely, its essentially due to user error, of trying cram that big junk into a too small a case where thing bends overy doesnt plug properly in resulting in an alternative parallel connection that is high resistance and causes heat buildup
[2022-12-03 19:58:13] <%+P5ingletary> is cohh coming back this afternoon or evening?

[2022-12-03 20:00:22] <%Tarquinius1> @GATORS_Vi well technically only the adapter plug itselt melts, even in the worst case the actual pc was never damaged
[2022-12-03 20:01:39] <+Manaron> Hello, my unknowing self would like to know if there are specific times for his "valheim tonight" streams. Or is this kinda random.
[2022-12-03 20:01:51] <%Tarquinius1> Funny enough the video actually mentions that people worried about it and plugging it in and out- actually increased the odds of accidents happening cohhLUL
[2022-12-03 20:02:02] <%Simon_Verhoeven> somewhat random, but I think in fourish hours?
[2022-12-03 20:02:07] <%PazifistTyco> the cozy streams are unofficial and have no guranteed times
[2022-12-03 20:02:13] <%Ambrakia> Usually in about about 4-4 and a half hours
[2022-12-03 20:02:18] <%Simon_Verhoeven> the best advice is to install the mobileapp
[2022-12-03 20:02:20] <%Simon_Verhoeven> !mobileapp

[2022-12-03 20:05:09] <+Manaron> ohhhh cohh app not twitch app
[2022-12-03 20:05:17] <%Ambrakia> Twitch app is useless
[2022-12-03 20:05:22] <+Manaron> I thought people meant mobile twitch for notifications LUL

[2022-12-03 20:07:39] <%+nediane> cohhD there are rules???
[2022-12-03 20:08:04] <%Beuwolfs> Bloody microsoft ! cohhOld For no apparent reason the windows update thought it be a good idea to update my AMD GPU drivers to a non-generic driver instead, so had to do a DDU and reinstall the proper drivers. Why would MS think updating those be a good idea ?? cohhHmm
[2022-12-03 20:08:08] <%Tarquinius1> They are secret cohhCult @nediane
[2022-12-03 20:08:37] <%Tarquinius1> @Beuwolfs Windows update derps out so often
[2022-12-03 20:08:39] <%+nediane> the rules <- cohhStab
[2022-12-03 20:09:26] <%Beuwolfs> Tarquinius1 I don' disagree with you there ! Although this is the first time the update actually removing my proper GPU drivers though !
[2022-12-03 20:09:31] <%ninchuka> cohhHmm Beuwolfs doesnt DDU have a option to disable windows updating GPU drivers
[2022-12-03 20:09:32] <%Tarquinius1> @Beuwolfs like the time it overwrote Cohh's capture card drivers with an entirely different devices drivers and broke the entire thing
[2022-12-03 20:10:15] <%ninchuka> I get M$ updating users drivers for people who dont do that themselves but it should turn that off if the user updates their drivers themselves
[2022-12-03 20:10:49] <%Beuwolfs> ninchuka As I understood it, just during the removal of the drivers. I paused the windows update for 7 days before hand so should be alright for now though.
[2022-12-03 20:10:59] <%ninchuka> cohhHmm

[2022-12-03 20:18:32] <%+nediane> no caps for you GATORS_Vi NOPERS
[2022-12-03 20:19:03] <%PsYcHoSeAn> well i don't need to Tarquinius1 ...but i want to cohhStare
[2022-12-03 20:19:44] <%Simon_Verhoeven> looking forwards to it, I have to admit I halted my first w3 when they announced it. (my PC was too weak for ages to play it properly cohhFeels )
[2022-12-03 20:19:58] <%Tarquinius1> PoE- only missing out on the new legue, same as all the other leagues- W3Remaster- same game with upped graphics and added QoL and Photomode
[2022-12-03 20:20:13] <%Beuwolfs> PsYcHoSeAn Simple solution though.. Play the PoE League first since those seems to be for a certain time.. the Witcher 3 update will be there anytime you ready to play it again ! cohhT
[2022-12-03 20:20:28] <%Tarquinius1> If you played em already, not much point in replaying em again
[2022-12-03 20:20:30] <%PsYcHoSeAn> bobT makes sense
[2022-12-03 20:20:41] <%PsYcHoSeAn> guess ill just finish witcher 3 for the first time ever
[2022-12-03 20:20:48] <%PsYcHoSeAn> no wait
[2022-12-03 20:21:00] <%PsYcHoSeAn> ill test out poe first. thats what i wanted to say NotLikeThis
[2022-12-03 20:21:03] <%Simon_Verhoeven> @Tarquinius1 didn't they also add some content to tie in with the series?
[2022-12-03 20:21:07] <%Simon_Verhoeven> @PsYcHoSeAn sensible
[2022-12-03 20:21:11] <%+GATORS_Vi> I put like 70 hrs on witcher 3 but never finished
[2022-12-03 20:21:26] <%Tarquinius1> @Simon_Verhoeven a couple of armor sets from the show
[2022-12-03 20:22:16] <%Astorma> Nilfgaard scrotum armor cohhBoom
[2022-12-03 20:22:23] <%Tarquinius1> @GATORS_Vi I 100% it twice
[2022-12-03 20:22:36] <%+GATORS_Vi> @tarquinius1 nice
[2022-12-03 20:22:40] <%Tarquinius1> And thus feel no reason to replay it
[2022-12-03 20:22:52] <%PsYcHoSeAn> i think i played through 90% of base game and then stopped cause of some other release. never finished it or the DLCs so definitly have to do it with the next gen update but yeah. maybe poe league sucks so ill test it first
[2022-12-03 20:22:55] <%Simon_Verhoeven> @Tarquinius1 ah, I had expected more.
[2022-12-03 20:23:10] <%Simon_Verhoeven> And the league is a temp thing, w3 remake will always be there
[2022-12-03 20:23:33] <%Tarquinius1> @PsYcHoSeAn def should, if anything the DLC is actually better
[2022-12-03 20:23:58] <%Simon_Verhoeven> like with Oblivion, I was meh on the main game, but Shivering isles is rooPog
[2022-12-03 20:24:13] <%Tarquinius1> @Simon_Verhoeven or TOW
[2022-12-03 20:24:24] <%Tarquinius1> esp the second DLC was really good
[2022-12-03 20:24:46] <%Simon_Verhoeven> indeed, albeit TOW was a bit of a letdown in general for me. I had hoped for me
[2022-12-03 20:24:49] <%Simon_Verhoeven> more*
[2022-12-03 20:24:55] <%Simon_Verhoeven> it was just too shallow for my liking
[2022-12-03 20:25:09] <%Tarquinius1> @Simon_Verhoeven they played it safe
[2022-12-03 20:26:03] <%Tarquinius1> Plus you could really see in places that it was done on a limited budget
[2022-12-03 20:26:03] <%Simon_Verhoeven> I wouldn't even call it playing safe, they just didn't give them a lot of background/depth (companions)
[2022-12-03 20:26:23] <%Simon_Verhoeven> Indeed
[2022-12-03 20:26:32] <%Simon_Verhoeven> it felt more like they wanted to go big, but didn't have the means
[2022-12-03 20:26:43] <%Simon_Verhoeven> bit like what happened with PoE2
[2022-12-03 20:27:21] <%Tarquinius1> I mean they even stated that they cut some stuff since they didnt have the resources to flesh it out and decided not to half ass it
[2022-12-03 20:27:24] <%Simon_Verhoeven> well I guess with PoE2 they had the budget, but spend too much on the VA
[2022-12-03 20:28:29] <%Simon_Verhoeven> And inded, looking forwards to what they can achieve with MS funding
[2022-12-03 20:28:51] <%Tarquinius1> Grounded and Pentiment cohhPog
[2022-12-03 20:28:57] <%Simon_Verhoeven> Did they keep the ToW license, or is that cohh7 ?
[2022-12-03 20:29:04] <%Tarquinius1> And those are only small side-projects
[2022-12-03 20:29:13] <%Tarquinius1> @Simon_Verhoeven they kept it
[2022-12-03 20:29:24] <%Tarquinius1> @Simon_Verhoeven TOW2 is already announced
[2022-12-03 20:29:27] <%+GATORS_Vi> tow?
[2022-12-03 20:29:33] <%Tarquinius1> The Outer Worlds
[2022-12-03 20:29:46] <%Simon_Verhoeven> thank you cohhL
[2022-12-03 20:29:55] <%Simon_Verhoeven> @Tarquinius1 RPG wise ;)

[2022-12-03 20:30:11] <%+GATORS_Vi> I wanted to like it so much but gun 1 and gun 2 killed it for me
[2022-12-03 20:30:48] <%Tarquinius1> I mean it was reported last year that Obsidian will release 7 games in the next 7 years
[2022-12-03 20:31:23] <%Tarquinius1> 2 of them- Grounded and Pentiment are out, and we still got 6 years and 5 games to go
[2022-12-03 20:31:41] <%+GATORS_Vi> new fallout from obsidian would be nice
[2022-12-03 20:32:31] <%Spero_Mcgee> in a way the PoE could still have a third installment if they wanted to
[2022-12-03 20:32:54] <%Spero_Mcgee> Though id prefer a Tyranny 2 tbh
[2022-12-03 20:33:16] <%Ambrakia> Tyranny IP is owned by Paradox isn't it?
[2022-12-03 20:33:16] <%Tarquinius1> @Spero_Mcgee less likely as Paradox owns that IP
[2022-12-03 20:33:31] <%Spero_Mcgee> I guess
[2022-12-03 20:33:49] <%Spero_Mcgee> it just sucks when these crpgs have open endings that just screams a potential sequel
[2022-12-03 20:34:18] <%+GATORS_Vi> they do that so if they make money they can build off it
[2022-12-03 20:34:21] <%Tarquinius1> Didnt sell enough cohhFeels
[2022-12-03 20:34:36] <%Ambrakia> That said, I wouldn't mind seeing Harebrained take a stab at Tyranny 2, they did a good job with Shadowrun
[2022-12-03 20:34:54] <%Ambrakia> Unlikely to happen I know, just a thought
[2022-12-03 20:35:07] <%Tarquinius1> Well rumor is the Microsoft is working on a new Shadowrun game
[2022-12-03 20:35:32] <smokingkittenhippie> hey did cohh take a half day today?
[2022-12-03 20:35:35] <%Ambrakia> Yeo
[2022-12-03 20:35:39] <%Ambrakia> Yep*
[2022-12-03 20:35:42] <%Tarquinius1> @smokingkittenhippie he always does on saturday
[2022-12-03 20:35:53] <%+GATORS_Vi> the Microsoft n Activision acquisition needs to be passed
[2022-12-03 20:35:59] <smokingkittenhippie> aahh ok i tough that was whednesday LUL
[2022-12-03 20:36:06] <%Spero_Mcgee> cohhHmm I should give Shadowrun a go sometime. I just couldnt get into it
[2022-12-03 20:36:31] <%Ambrakia> The first is a bit rough around the edges, the second is the best for story and companions while the first is the best combat
[2022-12-03 20:36:37] <%Tarquinius1> @smokingkittenhippie Thursdays and Saturdays
[2022-12-03 20:36:38] <%Ambrakia> third rather*
[2022-12-03 20:36:46] <smokingkittenhippie> aah cool thnx
[2022-12-03 20:36:47] <%$oddknight> a new shadowrun game would be PogChamp
[2022-12-03 20:36:52] <%+nediane> thursdays?
[2022-12-03 20:36:57] <%Spero_Mcgee> that doesnt too promising
[2022-12-03 20:36:58] <%$oddknight> Dragonfall is so good
[2022-12-03 20:37:07] <%Spero_Mcgee> Wouldnt combat be the one thing that you do the most?
[2022-12-03 20:37:16] <%Tarquinius1> he usually does half-days on thursdasy and saturday @nediane
[2022-12-03 20:37:42] <%Ambrakia> It's not bad combat by any means
[2022-12-03 20:37:51] <%+nediane> I've never noticed him gone Thursday afternoon?
[2022-12-03 20:37:55] <%Astorma> What does it do better in combat? cohhSus
[2022-12-03 20:37:57] <%Spero_Mcgee> since when were saturdays half days?
[2022-12-03 20:38:13] <%+nediane> saturdays has been almost as long as I've been here, so about a year
[2022-12-03 20:38:15] <%Ambrakia> He did Thursday as a half day for a bit but then switched, I don't recall why
[2022-12-03 20:39:24] <%Astorma> You know nothing, Jon Mcgee cohhBoom
[2022-12-03 20:40:32] <%Spero_Mcgee> Either it happened naturally or he mentioned changing it up, and I wasnt there to hear it
[2022-12-03 20:40:42] <%+nediane> weekends are better for kids once school gets involved, I suspect his schedule will change quite a bit over the coming years, wouldn't be surprised to see more afternoons off as the kids get to after-school activities/sports age
[2022-12-03 20:41:12] <%Tarquinius1> cohhRead Upcoming: Dead Island 2 showcase Dec 6, TGA Dec 8, BG3 panel Dec 14
[2022-12-03 20:41:29] <%Spero_Mcgee> Depends on the age of the kids. If its after school wouldnt the kids go by bike or bus immediately?

[2022-12-03 20:42:11] <%Astorma> Bus or bike in America cohhLUL
[2022-12-03 20:42:35] <%Vosy1984> did I do it right? cohhSip SnowTime
[2022-12-03 20:42:38] <%Vosy1984> I did
[2022-12-03 20:42:54] <%Spero_Mcgee> Public transport is shit? They do have busses and subways right? The movies showed as much cohhD
[2022-12-03 20:42:55] <%+nediane> hey, I biked plenty of places after school, also took the T (subway) because I'm city, but that's here around Boston
[2022-12-03 20:43:13] <%+nediane> public transportation very much depends on where you are
[2022-12-03 20:43:14] <%Tarquinius1> @nediane totally can't relate, was no such things when I was in school
[2022-12-03 20:43:34] <%+nediane> dinos need not apply cohhT
[2022-12-03 20:44:02] <%Spero_Mcgee> Public transport isnt exactly an ancient thing or anything. Unless you live in a rural area it aint an issue typically
[2022-12-03 20:44:06] <%Tarquinius1> Only time the parents ever came to to school was on graduation
[2022-12-03 20:44:20] <%Spero_Mcgee> and even rural areas have busses they just have longer travel schedules
[2022-12-03 20:44:53] <%Vosy1984> depends how big is the rural

[2022-12-03 20:45:16] <%Spero_Mcgee> But then thats typically why people would use a bicycle/ nowadays an electric one would be possible

[2022-12-03 20:45:39] <%Simon_Verhoeven> related to the DF shift I guess?

[2022-12-03 20:46:03] <%Simon_Verhoeven> They're less rural now, but still quite rural

[2022-12-03 20:46:29] <%Spero_Mcgee> @Vosy1984 I dunno. To me here in the Netherlands, going by bus if its in a rural area might mean a bus comes every 30 mins instead of every 10 mins but they are avaible. hence why most people actually use a bike
[2022-12-03 20:46:48] <%cdpr_lied_to_us> Kerenceious NODDERS
[2022-12-03 20:46:56] <%+nediane> so wait, how does that work Vosy1984 ? smoosh them together? or just one right after the other?
[2022-12-03 20:47:16] <%Astorma> Living in a European country it takes an hour to drive across vs living in an US state where it would take a day. cohhBoom
[2022-12-03 20:47:17] <%Vosy1984> we have a 35k population village near my city, they get busses each 10 min, depends on size
[2022-12-03 20:47:33] <%Spero_Mcgee> @Astorma What about trains though?
[2022-12-03 20:47:55] <%Tarquinius1> Where the railroad begins, sanity ends cohhT
[2022-12-03 20:47:57] <%Spero_Mcgee> @Vosy1984 does that count as rural though? cohhHmm
[2022-12-03 20:48:04] <%Vosy1984> @nediane I will type it with space cohhBlind Ice Cold Snow Time, remove the space between 1st word and 3rd word
[2022-12-03 20:48:06] <%+nediane> Spero_Mcgee that's also pretty typical, at least for areas around big cities here on the east coast of the US, but I dunno about further in or the left coast, but car tends to be the backup instead of bike, unless going super local
[2022-12-03 20:48:13] <%Vosy1984> @Spero_Mcgee it's the biggest village in my county

[2022-12-03 20:49:27] <%Vosy1984> @Spero_Mcgee a lot bought appartments/houses there back before 2008 crysis, and it expanded a lot, it still does this day
[2022-12-03 20:49:41] <%Vosy1984> they were like 1/4 the price in my city
