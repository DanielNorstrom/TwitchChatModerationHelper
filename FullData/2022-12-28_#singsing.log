[2022-12-28 15:06:59] <%+Grougn> @singsing from a recent reddit thread regarding starfall: The attack range is calculated from the outer edge of your hero's collision size, which is 24 for most heroes. This means the effective total attack range for Mirana is 654 (630 + 24). Starfall's trigger range is only 650 units, calculated from the center of your hero and NOT the outer edge of its collision size, which is why you cannot press Starfall at maximum range, as you're 4 units too far away from the enemy (654 vs 650).

[2022-12-28 18:06:25] <@%$wTone_> Bocchi is literally me. No other character can come close to relating to me like her. There is no way you can convince me that I’m not Bocchi. Bocchi could not possibly be any more me. It’s me, and nobody can convince me otherwise. If anyone approached me about this not possibly being me, I immediately shut them down with overwhelming evidence that Bocchi was me. Bocchi is absolutely me; it is indisputable. Why anyone would try to argue that Bocchi is not me is beyond me.
