[2022-12-16 21:20:43] <+Pibbs__> its fine when not factoring in the zone pull to multilevel spots. So your game can essentially be ruined by complete rng with having  3 end portals split to places you cant even get to. So one or more people just having their game ruined cause of that is kinda lame

[2022-12-16 21:46:35] <+blazinmonkey> i found playing on a smaller map with a 4x4 helped my long term performance in DF - i dont need a super big world if i can only interact with like 25% of it
[2022-12-16 21:47:22] <%LustPlayz> in rimworld a big thing that tanks fps is having too many jobs assigned to 1 person, can you do anything similar here?
[2022-12-16 21:47:28] <+ArmBard> @blazinmonkey the bigger worlds are kind of cool because you end up with artifacts with crazy histories once you go into Legends  mode, but yeah I play small worlds too for now

[2022-12-16 22:12:16] <Cortex_Reaver> solo would be like the original thief games from the 90s
[2022-12-16 22:12:24] <allhigh> if you are solo you just have to be prepared to run away at the drop of a hat
[2022-12-16 22:12:31] <%iLuminaye> @Klean so if you have a dorf that makes a overly desired artifact, you could have people coming in wanting to steal it and start tons of fights. That is if you have a public tavern

[2022-12-16 22:13:17] <%Flyingbacon37> very true, why cater to solos and ditch development of group based play

[2022-12-16 22:52:21] <Urban_Zamboni> @stillforlorn ty for the insight…it’s such a weird concept for me
[2022-12-16 22:52:47] <Urban_Zamboni> It’s like sponsored streams…or the comments section on a random corporate post on social media
[2022-12-16 22:53:01] <justcarbunkle> and it only recovers one spell per rarity as well
[2022-12-16 22:53:04] <Urban_Zamboni> It doesn’t take a genius to read the room so to speak
[2022-12-16 22:53:41] <Urban_Zamboni> blizzard keeps making Diablo 2 resurrected posts on Facebook and the comments are BRUTAL

[2022-12-16 22:57:45] <Urban_Zamboni> The other example is Sledgehammer making social media posts about cod: Vanguard when all the comments just say “People still play this trash???”
