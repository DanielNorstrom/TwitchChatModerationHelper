I don’t need anything more than this honestly, what else could you possible need? I Honestly think he's a bit overpowered to be honest. I really don’t see why he's not signed to an org yet. I’m kind of offended about it. But that’s just @zachmazer, being the leading IGL and all.

[2023-01-05 05:11:56] <%BoofMastrPreRoll> Not for me. IDK like most esports games dont use ray tracing
[2023-01-05 05:12:02] <%silent_r_gary> yeah you trade for lack of Ray tracing without rtx
[2023-01-05 05:12:09] <%silent_r_gary> @boofmastrpreroll exactly
[2023-01-05 05:12:25] <MrTwix3> I value it, but i dont only play eSports. I think it depends on the person
[2023-01-05 05:12:33] <@%+yayorozu> yeah amd still struggles a bit with raytracing, but their drivers use to be super buggy and they newer generations are a lot better

[2023-01-05 19:34:40] <@%^Nightbot> I love zachmazer. Way more cracked than a doodoo and messy noob in every way. He can main seer, gibby, newcastle and comms great with any team. I don’t need anything more than this honestly, what else could you possible need? I Honestly think he's a bit overpowered to be honest. I really don’t see why he's not signed to an org yet. I’m kind of offended about it. But that’s just zachmazer, being the leading IGL and all.

[2023-01-05 19:37:13] <%ZE6661> What if the fire rate of all smgs was brought down keeping the damage per bullet to only diminish it's dps and not it's kill potential
[2023-01-05 19:38:06] <ros3tta_ston3d> when we say SMG, we mean the CAR needs a nerf right?
[2023-01-05 19:38:17] <svd_neo> why is this going into crafter

[2023-01-05 19:38:41] <%ZE6661> The reason I'd rather diminish the fire rate instead of the damage is because nerfing the damage would make it impossible to kill a fortified legend without hitting every single bullet

[2023-01-05 19:39:46] <%ZE6661> @ros3tta_ston3d Car definitely needs a nerf, but even if they nerf the car, it doesnt mean people wont rather use r99 or prowler instead of any other secondary

[2023-01-05 19:46:21] <MrTwix3> @callme_tumez Recoil in apex is very situational. The real recoil pattern is mostly while standing, strafing side to side makes much easier to controll, all u do is pull down opposite direction of strafing
[2023-01-05 19:46:24] <+callme_tumez> @dripth369 yea i see, but also if i move right left, my shot animation goeas allways straight
[2023-01-05 19:46:28] <%ZE6661> What would the most appropiate nerf be? @mrtwix3 Maybe just removing the interrupt mechanic on the Q?

[2023-01-05 21:58:08] <@%^Nightbot> I love zachmazer. Way more cracked than a doodoo and messy noob in every way. He can main seer, gibby, newcastle and comms great with any team. I don’t need anything more than this honestly, what else could you possible need? I Honestly think he's a bit overpowered to be honest. I really don’t see why he's not signed to an org yet. I’m kind of offended about it. But that’s just zachmazer, being the leading IGL and all.

[2023-01-05 22:19:41] <thewildcongar> Velociraptors were actually feathered animals. They grew up to 100 pounds, about the size of a wolf. And they likely hunted solo—using their claws to clutch rather than slash prey—when they roamed central and eastern Asia between about 74 million and 70 million years ago, during the late Cretaceous period.

[2023-01-05 22:52:14] <@%^Nightbot> I love zachmazer. Way more cracked than a doodoo and messy noob in every way. He can main seer, gibby, newcastle and comms great with any team. I don’t need anything more than this honestly, what else could you possible need? I Honestly think he's a bit overpowered to be honest. I really don’t see why he's not signed to an org yet. I’m kind of offended about it. But that’s just zachmazer, being the leading IGL and all.
