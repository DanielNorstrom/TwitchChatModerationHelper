[2022-12-10 15:48:34] <darelock_> I rolled daily missions and got 3 victories
[2022-12-10 15:48:43] <darelock_> Now I wont win at all LUL

[2022-12-10 15:49:05] <%Elite071> Hoping for some blueprints for the jap heavys, 0 xp needed till T7, T8 4/8 bp, T9 2/10 and T10 9/12 skilRee
[2022-12-10 15:49:26] <darelock_> I have 1st and 3rd missions with blueprints as reward
[2022-12-10 15:49:48] <darelock_> That's nice addition to game
[2022-12-10 15:49:57] <%Elite071> When the old system gave you bp for T10 tanks stead of going up the line LUL
[2022-12-10 15:50:06] <%Elite071> Rewards for merit was nicer tho
[2022-12-10 15:50:21] <%Elite071> In one day, you could get 7 days of prem LUL
[2022-12-10 15:50:46] <darelock_> merit is the every 45 missions, yes ?
[2022-12-10 15:51:15] <%Elite071> Nono, it was before the missions, it was a reward system for playing the game
[2022-12-10 15:51:20] <%Elite071> a lot
[2022-12-10 15:51:32] <%Elite071> A 5 stage reward
[2022-12-10 15:51:33] <darelock_> Oh, I guess I had a break from WoT then
[2022-12-10 15:52:33] <%Elite071> at the fifth stage, you could get something big and good, getting 7 days of premium was a little too much for a 1 day grind LUL After the fifth stage, it would just reset and you could do it again
[2022-12-10 15:52:51] <darelock_> LUL
[2022-12-10 15:53:32] <darelock_> Current system is also ok, but premium time gives you so much LUL
[2022-12-10 15:53:44] <%Elite071> The latest change of the reward system with missions, was that blueprints starts at the lowest tier they were needed, little bit sad
[2022-12-10 15:53:46] <darelock_> It cuts the time you need to reach 45 missions in like half
[2022-12-10 15:54:19] <%Elite071> True, those prem days were not in their business plan I think and that's why they removed it LUL
[2022-12-10 15:55:14] <darelock_> One thing Im pissed at is the fact they made useless Santa commanders in drops tokens shop
[2022-12-10 15:55:39] <darelock_> I would pay more tokens for santa with like 2 perks at least LUL

[2022-12-10 17:22:40] <%Okumichi> @momix99 the reason is the use of y and z is different in german. and the keyboardlayout was inveted for typewriting. the more a series of keys are used, the more wider the gab between them. so the little key-hammers don't get jammed

[2022-12-10 21:54:50] <%hamddoo> hi
[2022-12-10 21:54:50] <@%momix99> i wish they would focus more on selling styles like this instead of always more powerful premiums
[2022-12-10 21:54:51] <GSkill4x4GB> @sotsnik_ No I mean permatrack enemies
[2022-12-10 21:54:52] <%+panzermax788> This camo also changes the engine sound a little bit skilLove
[2022-12-10 21:54:59] <Incoming_with_an_L> it's always awesome when the ammorack "get down mr president"s my side armor after a track is fixed
[2022-12-10 21:55:13] <@%ItzAndreyZhak> We need more premium, WG knows better... they have all the statistics and data @momix99 Kappa
[2022-12-10 21:55:19] <@%momix99> @ItzAndreyZhak Kappa
[2022-12-10 21:55:26] <%LosWitos> @momix99 skilShnay  i want udarniy
[2022-12-10 21:55:54] <@%momix99> @ItzAndreyZhak they dont have the data yet. they are still reviewing the data from 2012-2013 right now Kappa
[2022-12-10 21:56:09] <Lidurob> sup skill, how r u?
[2022-12-10 21:56:09] <EasyEight7> 1st time to see this skin
[2022-12-10 21:56:13] <@%ItzAndreyZhak> @momix99 They must be using Internet Explorer or something Kappa
[2022-12-10 21:56:19] <ironmillos> @momix99 nice, i really do not know what could be good for me.
[2022-12-10 21:56:24] <sotsnik_> @GSkill4x4GB Im the one who is usually permatracked :D I cant seem to be able to keep enemies  tracked without losing all my hp
[2022-12-10 21:56:33] <%Raidou_TCF> love the skin.. but outside of ranked i see no reason to play tier 10
[2022-12-10 21:56:39] <lopata_17> skin looks retro and modern at the same time
[2022-12-10 21:56:40] <%spartans_kill> @skill4ltu I'm happy to got this skin even more tahn 3 premium tanks
[2022-12-10 21:56:49] <wotcosmoc> nice skin
[2022-12-10 21:56:58] <Lidurob> tier 10 only tier without +2 mm
[2022-12-10 21:56:59] <%Temezius> Tier 10 is way to go
[2022-12-10 21:57:05] <superdreamxd> tier 10 bond farm
[2022-12-10 21:57:15] <%+WernerBros> t10 is 100% best spot to play at for me
[2022-12-10 21:57:15] <manos_apost> @skill4ltu whats the he pen on sconq
[2022-12-10 21:57:16] <%Raidou_TCF> @skill4ltu i play premium tanks 99% of the time in randoms
[2022-12-10 21:57:16] <@%momix99> @ironmillos think well about it. i think you have the entire year until next well deserved reward comes to pick them :)
[2022-12-10 21:57:19] <Ap3L1nc0ln> @skill4ltu  i feel tier10 is most goldspam and full of broken tanks
[2022-12-10 21:57:21] <Kneejerk72> @Lidurob tier 9 also
[2022-12-10 21:57:33] <%Raidou_TCF> @skill4ltu my name is literally "Raidou_prem_tank_enjoyer" lol

[2022-12-10 21:58:30] <%spartans_kill> @skill4ltu I'm happy to got this skin even more than 3 premium tanks
[2022-12-10 21:58:30] <Ap3L1nc0ln> @skill4ltu  true. Im not saying its bad. But it makes certain tanks completely unplayable
[2022-12-10 21:58:37] <lopata_17> as a free to play player, it's too expensive to play with tier X

[2022-12-10 23:09:57] <+logical_hawk> only need gold spam in stock tanks x)
[2022-12-10 23:10:00] <florist_sadju> it depends
[2022-12-10 23:10:00] <@%+evofrogmr> Agree.
[2022-12-10 23:10:02] <manos_apost> @skill4ltu  dont you think if we made all servers at one like na,eu,asia will bring the game back to the old days?
[2022-12-10 23:10:04] <@%Jegi_The_Heat> Not as while shooting but sure thing
[2022-12-10 23:10:07] <%+Fherot> @skill4ltu false. Spamming gold made me a better player in GSOR
[2022-12-10 23:10:09] <%+JafSpeed> I agree. never spam gold
[2022-12-10 23:10:11] <@%$Anthraxicus> Remember; Aiming has allegedly been shown to reduce your DPM. ;)
[2022-12-10 23:10:14] <%s00nchoy> you need to have more knowledge to farm without gold
[2022-12-10 23:10:15] <%operationdoom87> disagree cause
[2022-12-10 23:10:17] <%+Drywaters> Personally no, I’m not good enough, without gold I’m losing 80%
[2022-12-10 23:10:20] <+Yzangard> there is a french streamer that NEVER uses gold and that is very good
[2022-12-10 23:10:26] <%spartans_kill> @skill4ltu You will forget for sure to do that  Kappa
[2022-12-10 23:10:27] <%oli11196> @skill4ltu is Vivi out of fever?
[2022-12-10 23:10:31] <WestHeron> gold is a safe way to get some damage without knowing weak spots
[2022-12-10 23:10:31] <mr_mmuffin> I guess it sometimes depends on tank...
[2022-12-10 23:10:44] <gegrion> no point to use gold if i cannot aim :)
[2022-12-10 23:10:48] <@%Anthraxicus> Choo choo I'ma conductor weeee
[2022-12-10 23:10:51] <GSkill4x4GB> @WestHeron and to avoid RNG bullshittery
[2022-12-10 23:10:52] <PixiePinchr> I agree @mr_mmuffin
[2022-12-10 23:10:53] <zsigmond888> i want back old times when gold was real gold...
[2022-12-10 23:10:55] <@%momix99> @gegrion same here LUL
[2022-12-10 23:10:57] <miamano01_dodo> I only carrey a few and use golds if I have very low chance to pen... Im a broke :D
[2022-12-10 23:10:58] <%+Prince_Blue_> @skill4ltu true but when people gold spam you depending on the tank it can give you tumor of the brain XD LUL
[2022-12-10 23:11:00] <%+werys04> With new tanks even with gold u have to use brain :)
[2022-12-10 23:11:06] <WestHeron> @GSkill4x4GB well u get that with gold and standard LUL
[2022-12-10 23:11:07] <Mckrixx> Fellas there is a difference between no gold - some gold - and full gold
