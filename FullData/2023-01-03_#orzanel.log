[2023-01-03 08:21:15] <@%$superreiska> And putting cat outside isn't a good thing anyway, either the cat could get into trouble (tons of cats get hit by car) or as invasive species it could wreak havoc on birds etc.
[2023-01-03 08:21:31] <@%$superreiska> Locked yard would be gucci though if the cat can't get out from there

[2023-01-03 09:19:55] <%+aaronp5041> The Caliban needs an Aim lead so big that you have to aim at a game on the NA Server to hit the target you're looking at.
[2023-01-03 09:20:02] <%+bubimir> @Orzanel I've heard there is battle pass coming soon, do you know any inside info what can we expect

[2023-01-03 09:23:01] <%+aaronp5041> The Shell velocity of the Caliban reminds me of the old Centurion AVRE with the 165mm dustbin gun. You could drink a mug of tea between firing and the shell arriving on target

[2023-01-03 09:41:39] <+theoriginalfluffyllama> totally understand your point and I don't go there, but if you have a bad set of players in the middle the enemy can break through with the walls covering their advance, seen it loads of times

[2023-01-03 10:21:42] <hotsteamypile> @Orzanel Maybe it's also like "influencers". Today everyone can start a live on Fb or whatever and start talking. No matter if they have something to say or not. Back in the day music had to go through filters to get to you. Not every song made it to the radio and to your ears

[2023-01-03 14:09:45] <@^Nightbot> If you are new to WoT, use these tips: 1. Dont rush tiers. 2. Dont use mods, especially XVM. 3. Stick to Russian heavies for a start to learn game better, sidescraping, angling etc. 4. Dont buy high tier premium tanks, until you play regular tanks in that tier. 5. Watch this stream to become better player, watch my positioning on the maps and listen to what i say because i explain what i'm doing B) . Watch Wargaming videos about game mechanics
