[2023-01-06 04:56:57] <%mrq02> I'm a Moira main. Strongly believe she's the best support in the game.
[2023-01-06 04:57:00] <@%fabriisio> Madge bubbles
[2023-01-06 04:57:20] <%Why_Not_Zoidberg_AU> Zen is best support
[2023-01-06 04:57:27] <thkmacho> @mrq02 you have to teach me one day on how to use her!!!  I have no idea how💀
[2023-01-06 04:57:39] <%Why_Not_Zoidberg_AU> Zen teaches us to be at peace with ourselves
[2023-01-06 04:57:42] <Earthshatter22> Moira is one of em healers that has as much DMG as healing which is crazy good
[2023-01-06 04:57:42] <@%neelerita> your heal doesnt go through walls

[2023-01-06 04:58:28] <%mrq02> @thkmacho Her cloud does healing over time. So you tap instead of hold. Never use the heal bubble unless it's dire. Get her ult as fast as possible and do your best to put at least one of your teammates and one of their teammates in it; it heals and damages at the same time. beeSmart

[2023-01-06 05:35:26] <+SMkeyboards> Tbh. Reaper is great for flanks. TP behind then fade when health is low.

[2023-01-06 05:43:45] <AcolyteOfLordZaroto> It's always an issue not knowing when your teammates are dead. My friend always asks where the healing is right after I die, so at the very least, I guess I'm doing an alright job.

[2023-01-06 07:19:33] <+AfkToilet> @Mabujold its because you haven't seen good Echos, I dont care what some youtube Tier lister tells me LUL
[2023-01-06 07:19:40] <katIyin> I wish the JQ change today made her able to compete with current tanks but kiriko and orisa just counter her hard lmao
[2023-01-06 07:20:06] <+Mabujold> I have seen tons of great echos. They usually get 1tapped by a good Sojourn right now
[2023-01-06 07:20:14] <+AfkToilet> wait was she mid air when she died to Bastion's ult? cause I always wondered if it hits people in air

[2023-01-06 09:12:45] <5had0w_2605> i recommend ramattra actually

[2023-01-06 12:21:53] <%hadesoria> and to also on multiple enemies.

[2023-01-06 12:22:31] <+Archangel3003> @esmojinx If a map is close quarters, with little areas around corners, then they maybe shouldn't play Anna
[2023-01-06 12:22:38] <%+NxKuuro> i know she is a dva main but is she learning other tanks too i see her playing sigma and hog more often
[2023-01-06 12:23:28] <+Archangel3003> @One_Eh She was strong anyway as long as your team followed and was aggressive and healer made sure to keep you topped up. Most just thought she was a weak tank so didn't follow you in though :/
[2023-01-06 12:23:29] <esmojinx> @archangel3003 well ana can be played anywhere and i think teammates should orientate around her for a good synergy and nice heals

[2023-01-06 13:11:44] <+fOrceez> if they are bronze they are probably playing at their rank level unfortunately.
[2023-01-06 13:11:58] <neebze_> it is frustrating playing with this and also probably frustrating for the player doing it coz they are also not in the right elo

[2023-01-06 15:53:56] <@%fabriisio> the rules says no backseating but is ok to suggest things, maybe we could make it more strict ariaHmm
[2023-01-06 15:54:01] <%Kroxldyphlike> I watch a streamer who literally posts a giant message on their overlay that says no backseating in gigantic colored letters but people still do it, there will always be some who need to get bonked

[2023-01-06 15:55:52] <jhonmcgiver> I think some backsiting is reactionary. You see something happens., and you immediately say/type something. Just like how people watch sports.

[2023-01-06 15:57:00] <%+kai_thick> No they are not thinking that, they just thought they are smart ass
[2023-01-06 15:57:04] <%zorg666> you shouldnt need to express any frustration, just keep timing them out and banning repeat offenders
[2023-01-06 15:57:12] <%katIyin> the group feels one sided they ask for help she does help but when she does nobody came to heal her in a pinch @Arico420
[2023-01-06 15:57:15] <+inemineminem> has the importance of picking the right characters gone up now that tanks are stronger?

[2023-01-06 15:59:28] <%katIyin> @fabriisio honestly a ban seem fitting over a timeout but thats just me
[2023-01-06 15:59:28] <jhonmcgiver> I don't think people are making a judgement to give their advice or opinon. I feel is more casual. Like "oh that player missed the hoop, he should of standed a little back." It is a kneejerk reaction, but it affects you more because you are already feeling down.

[2023-01-06 16:30:38] <%atomchoco> for rein orisa is good
[2023-01-06 16:30:41] <Bhu1234> Dva and Zarya are both great against Rein
[2023-01-06 16:30:42] <Tbob11> thx streamelements
[2023-01-06 16:30:48] <%atomchoco> and we need dps too
[2023-01-06 16:30:49] <%YoursTruly4ev3r> @ChaddeusMaximus too much, like 30
[2023-01-06 16:31:01] <Aiki_Taka> So far from what i've seen you've been winning the rein matchups when you played orisa
[2023-01-06 16:31:06] <%+TheGameJangy> I usually go Rein against Rein
[2023-01-06 16:31:15] <Tbob11> play roadhog and terrorize soloq
[2023-01-06 16:31:21] <Aiki_Taka> the only problem is their dps become the problem then
[2023-01-06 16:31:25] <lisubisue> tbh pushing him back w/ orisa or dva is pretty good imo if he doesnt have a pocket
[2023-01-06 16:31:28] <+Raxzio> you dogged on that rein when you switch to orisa then he immediatly switched
[2023-01-06 16:31:34] <%atomchoco> and team support is needed with orisa

[2023-01-06 16:31:58] <%Mr_Pirate> Any tank with a pocket Mercy is hard to play against
[2023-01-06 16:31:58] <%+mysticangel18> Moria isn’t a pocket healer
[2023-01-06 16:32:04] <ChaddeusMaximus> rammatra against rein is good because the punches go through the shield
[2023-01-06 16:32:10] <ChaddeusMaximus> if you have a pocket you win ez
[2023-01-06 16:32:10] <Tbob11> tank is the most counterpick based role

[2023-01-06 16:33:32] <%+mysticangel18> Moria is more of a group healer and dps since the healing orb heals multiple ppl

[2023-01-06 16:38:21] <ChanTheRi5en> good morning
[2023-01-06 16:38:27] <Aiki_Taka> because if you play agressive vs ram you make him defend which takes time away from him being able to puch

[2023-01-06 16:39:32] <%+nogdogd> @Aiki_Taka not really... his blocking does not reduce hammer damage so he would actually prefer to have a punch vs hammer showdown. especially when u can penetrate and hit mulitple targets with punch

[2023-01-06 16:51:47] <+shien1820> They should design rank based on skill level and if your skill level rise you will still get the people of same rank and rank up faster. Yeah it will be frustrating probably for the enemy first but it is just one game.
[2023-01-06 16:51:48] <%Mr_Pirate> They just need to make ranks actually matter and use that for match making
[2023-01-06 16:51:53] <+OlgaFanClubMember> It’s not just going up against higher elo players your also getting players on your team with lower elo than you

[2023-01-06 16:52:34] <+TheDaryst> best is the whole team is random bronz and the enemy team is a 5 person squad from gold 1 :D
[2023-01-06 16:52:38] <%zorg666> I dont think you really accurately know, since most people have private profiles
[2023-01-06 16:52:46] <Aiki_Taka> if you're diamond at 1 role there is no way you're going to be bronze at other roles

[2023-01-06 17:02:42] <+shien1820> @mysticangel18 I see but what i mean is to have teammates and enemys with the skill worth this rank. That will mostly get you winning the round and get you ranked up faster to rank your skill is suited. Otherwise if the matchmaking is only based on skill than you could get enemys that is on a higher rank with bad teammates of your rank and not your skill.
[2023-01-06 17:02:49] <sisaleo> 9c is good
