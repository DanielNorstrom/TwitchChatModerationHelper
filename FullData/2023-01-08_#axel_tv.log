[2023-01-08 16:40:40] <frenkzors> @wilwilwilbewilwel one of the theories about that is that Lightkeeper might be the true endgame for the full release of the game, so that its so absurdly difficult :/ its strange tho, for sure

[2023-01-08 16:54:44] <@%$GigsTM> We just did it.
[2023-01-08 16:54:46] <darth4g> is SJ9 arguably the rarest stim?

[2023-01-08 17:15:00] <@%^Nightbot> @tinninches  1) most ppl run top tier ammo, lvl4 helmets aren’t going to save you 2) its an extra empty slot, so I can take more stuff out 3) if u like killa helmet / lvl 3 visors feel free to run them as they are viable imho :) .

[2023-01-08 17:21:58] <+wetravioli2> hopefully they add 2 as a quest reward or something

[2023-01-08 17:24:18] <+wetravioli2> @wilwilwilbewilwel its not supposed to be easy at all
[2023-01-08 17:24:21] <the_Parrish> do you like to play RPG's? i have been playing Elder Scrolls lately. its so fun
[2023-01-08 17:24:26] <+wetravioli2> its supposed to be the hardest thing by a long shot
[2023-01-08 17:24:32] <!%+ItzPyroGG> @wilwilwilbewilwel they are delaying lightkeeper, because he is not ready probably
[2023-01-08 17:24:33] <+wetravioli2> supposedly its how you "escape from tarkov"
[2023-01-08 17:24:35] <wilwilwilbewilwel> there is a difference between easy and 0.09% chance
[2023-01-08 17:24:58] <+wetravioli2> like 90% of the player base with or without sj9 wouldn't get him this wipe
[2023-01-08 17:25:02] <%tinninches> @wilwilwilbewilwel About .09% that's quick mafs

[2023-01-08 17:25:53] <+wetravioli2> its supposed to be harder than kappa
[2023-01-08 17:25:58] <+wetravioli2> and how many ppl had kappa last wipe
[2023-01-08 17:26:07] <%byThePaul> maybe starfield
[2023-01-08 17:26:13] <%tinninches> @wetravioli2 I did Kappa
[2023-01-08 17:26:14] <damooseninja> howdy Axel how are you today?
[2023-01-08 17:26:18] <+wetravioli2> @wetravioli2 same
[2023-01-08 17:26:22] <the_Parrish> ok cool
[2023-01-08 17:26:26] <wilwilwilbewilwel> kappa is easy it's just a time sink this is just stupid rng
[2023-01-08 17:26:26] <!%+ItzPyroGG> @wetravioli2 whats the point of hyping up an ingame trader, to not make is accessible for the player base
[2023-01-08 17:26:39] <+syrec_> is this an AK TR3 in the back ?
[2023-01-08 17:26:55] <+wetravioli2> @ItzPyroGG its BSG they hype up everything
[2023-01-08 17:27:17] <%ActivateZeroG> @ItzPyroGG It adds another goal for the players to achieve, like max traders, kappa or sbh

[2023-01-08 17:27:27] <wilwilwilbewilwel> i don't even care if its hard to get lightkeeper but literally less than a TENTH of a percentage chance to find needed items is a joke
[2023-01-08 17:27:44] <+wetravioli2> @wilwilwilbewilwel we dont know if they're gonna add any other way to get them
[2023-01-08 17:27:56] <!%+ItzPyroGG> @ActivateZeroG its not a goal if they want a stim that is even more rare than a red keycard
[2023-01-08 17:27:57] <wilwilwilbewilwel> well hopefully they do otherwise the whole thing is a joke

[2023-01-08 17:28:53] <@%mfrayd> lightkeeper isn't ready that's why he's locked behind all these quests
[2023-01-08 17:28:56] <wilwilwilbewilwel> the rationale that "its meant to be end game for when there are no wipes" makes no sense I doubt we get that in even a few years

[2023-01-08 18:09:45] <%+itburnsswhenipvp> @nihaw69 iskra's in the military boxes, green ones or the black ones if lucky
[2023-01-08 18:09:49] <@%$atownmanx> @nihaw69 there's a few of the black cubes that always spawn them
[2023-01-08 18:09:51] <Crujien> @justgethigh Nah no real need to. It only clears stuff from memory that's already in standby so none of your actual "active" programs will get touched
[2023-01-08 18:09:54] <%+itburnsswhenipvp> or just craft them

[2023-01-08 18:23:37] <%+MrSergo15> Actually maybe. I have a thought So the levels you gain from tasks are bugged and you don't get the full points. (like +1 sniper, etc). I got +2 metabolism for Survivalist: Junkie, but only enough skill points to go up one level. Maybe it thinks it's already elite. Thoughts?

[2023-01-08 19:22:17] <%+itburnsswhenipvp> @727life They 100% are, the only input they take with substance are streamers like lvndmark who end up ruining the game with their bad takes to make the game easier for their style of play, BSG don't care about the casual playerbase when all you gotta do is do a drops campaign to bring back the playerbase

[2023-01-08 20:07:16] <%+kevxxd> but ive got a theorie, that you can get sj9 stimms from guards
[2023-01-08 20:07:29] <%+kevxxd> they are cultists

[2023-01-08 20:08:18] <@%^Nightbot> @madbombermo  Chatters can fight to time each other out for 10 minutes. To start a fight, redeem the 3333 channel point option and @ your opponent. If they accept, both participants say !roll to roll a number. The higher roll wins, and the lower roll gets a time out. Ties are a reroll.
[2023-01-08 20:08:18] <%Dstruktr> @NoiceGuy Yooo waddup
[2023-01-08 20:08:25] <+MegaIndiann> what is spawn chance on them?

[2023-01-08 20:09:04] <%+itburnsswhenipvp> "They spawn on labs" They haven't for a long time really goes to show how out of touch they are lol

[2023-01-08 20:09:51] <!%+NoiceGuy> I literally said hey are you sure there isn't a bug between sj9 and sj12  were findign sj12 everywhere
[2023-01-08 20:09:55] <%+napperdapperbootyslapper> @viirexval Wait for their spawn chance to increase from 3%
[2023-01-08 20:09:58] <+mcalkins5> whats the diffrence? they both give you lower body temp
[2023-01-08 20:10:05] <+mcalkins5> sj 12 sj9
[2023-01-08 20:10:10] <%+itburnsswhenipvp> @mcalkins5 1 is required for a quest

[2023-01-08 21:55:04] <murrrrrrron> !fight
[2023-01-08 21:55:04] <@%^Nightbot> @murrrrrrron  Chatters can fight to time each other out for 10 minutes. To start a fight, redeem the 3333 channel point option and @ your opponent. If they accept, both participants say !roll to roll a number. The higher roll wins, and the lower roll gets a time out. Ties are a reroll.
[2023-01-08 21:55:17] <akaSetras> @DasCook1e посмотри на черный и на бежевый шлемы, у них разные крепления, на бежевом просто нет крепления для забрала.

[2023-01-08 23:52:24] <@%^Nightbot> @Dstruktr  Axel bought an AK-12. It is a real gun, but the gas block and barrel have been modified so the gun does not fire. https://clips.twitch.tv/CrowdedFairOcelotPanicBasket-gGUJFw7vgC8I-m9N

[2023-01-08 23:53:03] <iSnipeLikeJesus> I hope shit just gets better. I was grinding like crazy last wipe and then this one is just bad. I'm only 15 only played a handful of raids. Just not having a good time playing anymore
[2023-01-08 23:53:10] <%ActivateZeroG> Sound is completely fucked
[2023-01-08 23:53:13] <%+kevxxd> and they will never have one big map like they plan to do
