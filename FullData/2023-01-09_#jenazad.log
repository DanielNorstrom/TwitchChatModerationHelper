[2023-01-09 05:27:00] <DustinMcDohl> it does not play well with LDplayer. kinda annoying. it always takes me 3 tries to get into town

[2023-01-09 05:27:41] <Hefflaren> I mean you will run in the problem that you dont have enough fodder to upgrade all your faction x units so you need to make mixed team to actually progress in the game LUL
[2023-01-09 05:27:51] <+EpicSwag17> for type matchups, early game either run human/elf or beast/undead
[2023-01-09 05:27:53] <+EpicSwag17> is common
[2023-01-09 05:27:54] <%greatersociety> @playdarkholes3 lore story only happens at the beginning end of every chapter.  and in the story mode.  I forgot what it's actually called.  its like they separated story from pve or something

[2023-01-09 08:03:58] <%eljackoloco> @Danzras direct involvement from the artist , aka Tite Kubo is the reason why that gacha still alive, heck after long while it became the reason why bleach had new anime season renewed in 2022
[2023-01-09 08:04:00] <GrimWisp> think i'm around 2k in league after 10 years
[2023-01-09 08:04:01] <Vermoon_> I've played league since season 3, I've spend a lot on skins

[2023-01-09 08:04:30] <Szuuno> after they introduced the loot box system I havent spent money on skins for league. No point
[2023-01-09 08:04:31] <kathlyyynn> what rank did u peak on league?
[2023-01-09 08:04:35] <%eljackoloco> basically Tite kubo been making these "what if" unit that doesnt exist in manga, like 2nd stage espadas, quincy ichigo, max hollow ichigo and etc

[2023-01-09 08:24:47] <LaSaizel> isnt it because their stream is embedded on the wiki of a lot of games and i guess it counts the people on the wiki as viewers

[2023-01-09 08:40:46] <I_Watch_Eromanga_Sensei> is Vivienne the big BOOBA witch
[2023-01-09 08:40:53] <ProfessorLoki> Viv does more dmg, but talia does dmg + utiltiy
[2023-01-09 08:40:57] <jorsh_leghost> damn the archer is pretty crazy vs assasins
[2023-01-09 08:41:03] <eman209> Catherine ult has invincibility

[2023-01-09 08:50:47] <%Beanflakes> oh right you do have naia
[2023-01-09 08:50:49] <%ie_g> you could also try assassinating the enemy catherine with jacqueline
