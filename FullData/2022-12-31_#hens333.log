[2022-12-31 14:36:29] <TTV_ItzPhantom> are we talking about soloqueue vs good killers
[2022-12-31 14:36:36] <Iump> many people who solo q in general suck a lot that's why nobody plays with them and they solo q
[2022-12-31 14:36:51] <jgjfhvbjvjvjv> @Doctor_Caustic Yeah. Use the first blink to teleport to the survivor's last seen location and the second blink to teleport to the survivor
[2022-12-31 14:37:10] <FortunateLis> @Iump thats a bold statement

[2022-12-31 14:38:21] <TTV_ItzPhantom> @JayDokuro part of solo que is because they don't know how to play against a nurse and then blame nurse for being op
[2022-12-31 14:38:30] <TTV_ItzPhantom> or any good killer for that matter
[2022-12-31 14:38:33] <Leguna> They lack critical information PepeLaugh
[2022-12-31 14:38:38] <TTV_ItzPhantom> true
[2022-12-31 14:38:43] <+Jambeard> is it just bad matchmaking
[2022-12-31 14:38:49] <$JayDokuro> @TTV_ItzPhantom i mean nurse is op tho, since she breaks the rules of dbd as the only killer, but yea i get what u mean
[2022-12-31 14:39:06] <$JayDokuro> @TTV_ItzPhantom also just blaming it on nurse being op and not trying to learn doesnt help either
[2022-12-31 14:39:08] <!%YourFriendLumpy> dbd just has the most "unique" matchmaking

[2022-12-31 14:39:53] <+grins257> uys probably because each killer has different countere and things to do that players aren't taught by the game

[2022-12-31 14:48:02] <%ClussyHonks> if im going to be honest - we need Doomfist as a killer for dbd

[2022-12-31 14:55:52] <JulianCalabasas> @ttv_itzphantom honestly, I feel like that's just a conspiracy theory and the problem is there's just too many awful maps in the game. I do have the same experience as you where I've literally only gotten Badham, Garden, Eyrie, Square or Coldwind for 40 matches in a row but that was also largely due to MOs so idk

[2022-12-31 15:03:53] <FortunateLis> honestly playing spirit without best addons made me rethink her viability a little, I think she is pretty balanced without her addons

[2022-12-31 15:14:23] <RedLobos> They're both strong in different scenarios the main reason I think slinger is not better is because he cant get a hit around every pallet

[2022-12-31 15:14:33] <+TrashPandaWithaHat> this is night and day on the huntress game on rpd

[2022-12-31 15:14:51] <FortunateLis> map pressure on huntress is overrated, mos of the time you will hit trees or high walls from far away

[2022-12-31 15:15:23] <FortunateLis> so you will have to walk there anyway, its not much different from deathslinger, but he is at leas can make it there faster

[2022-12-31 15:34:08] <%+ForestGrandpa> If by "nothing" you mean ignoring every unhook perk so the killer can tunnel you without any problem, then yeah, it does nothing
[2022-12-31 15:34:15] <asyashi> cages are basically slugs that give hook states
[2022-12-31 15:34:17] <RedLobos> It just makes them get hooked faster and it doesnt activate DS or OTR

[2022-12-31 15:35:01] <RedLobos> Just shows how strong tunneling is instead of the actual torment
[2022-12-31 15:35:15] <NoName_DP> Navy seal team over there OMEGALUL
[2022-12-31 15:35:17] <%+jasonkruger600> Ph is the best killer to tunnel except maybe blight or nurse
[2022-12-31 15:35:32] <d4vldtebra> i think cages should trigger hook perks
[2022-12-31 15:35:33] <asyashi> hens go 5 mins without downplaying huntress

[2022-12-31 15:35:53] <Kernann> Wasn't it said that Spirit was probably the best killer for tunneling (assuming you can play her)
[2022-12-31 15:35:57] <pogs_geller> @blanchedhelle wagwan innit bruv whats your bbm pin?

[2022-12-31 15:36:00] <RedLobos> Even if it triggered hook perks, it also doesnt give you your exhaustion back

[2022-12-31 15:36:16] <%+jasonkruger600> @jambeard Weaker is also good but not as good as ph imo
[2022-12-31 15:36:18] <RedLobos> so it guarantees an easier chase
[2022-12-31 15:36:35] <RedLobos> Like rn
[2022-12-31 15:36:44] <RedLobos> He can cage and go to the other side and kill her

[2022-12-31 15:37:52] <RedLobos> Its also very predictable where the cage will be and you get killer instinct when they save

[2022-12-31 15:39:57] <%+RiskiAce> Is there a single a killer who likes motherâs dwelling
[2022-12-31 15:40:09] <loopingplays> PH with double range mean while his ultra rare addons .

[2022-12-31 15:47:56] <MonsterKillxDD> @leifhansenrp You can get a prebuilt just make sure they show everything what's inside it. On some websites you can also choose what you want in a pc and they'll build it for you. It's better to build it yourself or have someone you know build it for you though but I don't know how are the gpu etc prices rn.

[2022-12-31 15:48:58] <%EvilD34d> what if you could change direction of where you threw the survivor...for example towards a corner or into an object...would that make him too strong? maybe an addon to enable this?
[2022-12-31 15:49:12] <Real_RUBB3R> @NoName_DP definitely, OoO is really just a disadvantage nowadays because it tells the killer where you are, and if they're a stealth killer you're just giving them free info, and the part where it says "Increases the chance of becoming the obsession" might as well say "You will be the obsession"

[2022-12-31 16:36:42] <vibe_juice> @hens333 after playing that way I donât think you have any right to complain about sweaty survivors like your match on Gideon meat plant earlier

[2022-12-31 16:36:44] <+Memm> he really greeded that pallet?
[2022-12-31 16:36:55] <%+pribzz> real reason hens went to NA is because of his sixth sense to know that EU servers would die this month

[2022-12-31 17:32:47] <JDSpirit_> i dont mind facing him, his hit box is just a bit too generous sometimes it feels
[2022-12-31 17:32:56] <%+mig_rattlehead> which is rare for a killer

[2022-12-31 19:02:51] <TheQueensPup> there's more and more aura perks for killers being added, the latest Knight's Nowhere To Hide which is quite popular atm with Eruption CoB etc so yeha
[2022-12-31 19:02:53] <+fremanofkol> wait is that another Mikaila cosmetic ive never seen.... how many does she have?

[2022-12-31 19:03:03] <TheQueensPup> explains why more people run Distortion
[2022-12-31 19:03:48] <comic_sansss> not so strong slowdown would be my choice
[2022-12-31 19:03:48] <%+BarelyLive> so many people hate my aura reading huntress build :D
[2022-12-31 19:03:48] <TheQueensPup> oh we were just talking about that more survivors are running Distortion now
[2022-12-31 19:03:55] <comic_sansss> distortion is in my every buil lol
[2022-12-31 19:03:57] <comic_sansss> build*
[2022-12-31 19:04:05] <BarrelTitorBaku> I would rather take the killer with slowdown but no aura read
[2022-12-31 19:04:07] <TheQueensPup> @BarelyLive I only play her with aura reading as well
[2022-12-31 19:04:11] <+TrashPandaWithaHat> aura build to go against. I feel more confident in chases than fighting over gen progress
[2022-12-31 19:04:36] <%jayhena> no info vs stealth is so boring
[2022-12-31 19:04:38] <TheQueensPup> I love dodging bbq with snowmen, they're just portable lockers
[2022-12-31 19:04:53] <TheQueensPup> even if the killer sees you enter you can just hop out and walk somewhere and they won't know

[2022-12-31 19:04:55] <%+DemonicGhost27_> @BarrelTitorBaku so youll take a 3 gen lock knight over a huntress with all aura reading?
[2022-12-31 19:05:05] <NolandJames> 69...nice
[2022-12-31 19:05:19] <Angel9thRune> I don't have fun being paralyzed by Eruption every 20 seconds.
[2022-12-31 19:05:20] <%the_oracle_> im a little late to the party, did you see that otz video on zanshin clown hens? hensComfy
[2022-12-31 19:05:23] <Angel9thRune> I'd rather chew glass.
[2022-12-31 19:05:37] <comic_sansss> can u apply call of brine to more than one gen?
[2022-12-31 19:05:37] <%jayhena> that claud survived atleast a full 5 minutes more and got less bloodpoint
[2022-12-31 19:05:43] <%jayhena> @comic_sansss yes
[2022-12-31 19:05:46] <comic_sansss> wow
[2022-12-31 19:05:49] <comic_sansss> didnt know that
[2022-12-31 19:05:53] <TheQueensPup> @Angel9thRune nice, crunchy Kappa
[2022-12-31 19:06:03] <d4vldtebra> do you ever play nurse?
[2022-12-31 19:06:05] <+TrashPandaWithaHat> My slowdown perks I usually run are Jolt & Pain res together. The other 2 perks are for aura/chase type perks
[2022-12-31 19:06:06] <BarrelTitorBaku> @BarrelTitorBaku hmm hard one. for one game or for all eternity? I haven't faced many gen lock knights that play it well actually.
[2022-12-31 19:06:10] <@%Loni1211> @the_oracle_ is that where the zanshin meme comes from?
[2022-12-31 19:06:37] <%the_oracle_> @Loni1211 i am not familiar with that meme, been out the loop the past week or so
[2022-12-31 19:06:49] <%jayhena> @Loni1211 someone made a clown guide and recommended zanshin as best perk, and people have been meme'ing on zanshin as op perk

[2022-12-31 19:06:56] <+spaceisbig> Otz just put out a short on how to counter Hillbilly. Does this mean you and Spookyloops will end up as the last 2 Hillbilly players?
[2022-12-31 19:07:11] <comic_sansss> idk how to play against the knight. i last less against him than vs nuse
[2022-12-31 19:07:12] <Angel9thRune> @hens333 You're really good at survivor. I have to ask. How do you deal with Pinhead in solo queue? When I'm against him, I feel in charge of everything. The box, doing a gen, unhooking a survivor across the map already.... it's hell. I usually just DC against Pinhead because I just don't have the patience.
[2022-12-31 19:07:13] <@%Loni1211> @jayhena ahhhh I see I see, ty for explaining LULW
[2022-12-31 19:07:13] <comic_sansss> nurse*
[2022-12-31 19:07:17] <+TrashPandaWithaHat> I pick jolt & pain res due to being rewarded for winning chases. Makes the game more of a back and forth imo
[2022-12-31 19:07:33] <%mig_rattlehead> Loni zanshin is the one true perk
[2022-12-31 19:07:35] <@%Loni1211> In soloQ always go for box and let the team do the rest
[2022-12-31 19:07:35] <Artisticpainting> Hi Hens
[2022-12-31 19:07:40] <tearmeapart_> i mean nurse is fun but not when u dont have any good perks and u go against actual comp survs but ig you get better
[2022-12-31 19:07:41] <@%Loni1211> If theyâre decent mates youâre fine
[2022-12-31 19:07:44] <jogbee> do you normally play a new killer ever game. its a lot more fun than the same one ever time
[2022-12-31 19:07:44] <casunaaa> hello hens, how long do you stream?
[2022-12-31 19:07:50] <@%Loni1211> Nah Mig donât do this to me
[2022-12-31 19:08:04] <+Propret> I wanna go out for NYE, but I'm getting way too fatigued
[2022-12-31 19:08:06] <%mig_rattlehead> Loni I have seen what zanshin can do
[2022-12-31 19:08:08] <+Propret> Someone help me
[2022-12-31 19:08:16] <crocing> hi hens!
[2022-12-31 19:08:17] <comic_sansss> i wish they add ping system instead of just the icon. with the icon you will know what your teamamtes are  doing but u still cant comunicate so wont change much
[2022-12-31 19:08:21] <@%animeangel09> @Propret take nap YesYes

[2022-12-31 19:08:32] <+TrashPandaWithaHat> pinhead can be extremely oppressive if you get the right loadout
[2022-12-31 19:08:37] <+Propret> @animeangel09 I have like 30m left :(
[2022-12-31 19:08:37] <%the_oracle_> @Propret going out on NYE is overrated, so crowded and unfun, stay in and play games hensGlad
[2022-12-31 19:08:39] <TheQueensPup> @Propret get some fresh air, drink some water, get up and move around
[2022-12-31 19:08:42] <comic_sansss> ping system will help vs pinhead a lot
[2022-12-31 19:08:42] <%mig_rattlehead> Loni it is done, zanshin is the way, embrace it
[2022-12-31 19:08:43] <Angel9thRune> My worry is if I'm taking chase with him, a survivor still isn't doing the box. I feel like I gotta do that too.
[2022-12-31 19:08:45] <NyquilEvangelist> Ping system would be soooooo toxic
[2022-12-31 19:08:50] <Angel9thRune> Then we end up in chain hunt all game.
