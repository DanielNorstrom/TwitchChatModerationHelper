[2023-01-09 13:25:19] <+Babylon> On the inverse, Break has been very candid talking about how switching from PUBG has been very detrimental to his channel and his paycheck. It's harder for  UK streamers IMO
[2023-01-09 13:25:22] <+triggawild_si> the way I watch. I watch a stream from enjoying the content creator over the game. I'd rather watch an entertaining stream with a game I'm not that into over a game I love with a crappy streamer.

[2023-01-09 13:29:12] <Gamertyler2> pubg is pretty good now imo i put it down for a few years too
[2023-01-09 13:29:14] <adsie1> Paul is the reason I found dayZ and still continued to play it through the very buggy days etc
[2023-01-09 13:29:22] <realmrpoopypantz> so what made u overcome those negative comments back in 2016 and keep on running?

[2023-01-09 13:31:23] <%+PULLINSKI> @thviking i would agree on more different assets etc. but in general i think its a beautiful game

[2023-01-09 13:32:20] <+Pittmanz> i dont think these types of games will die anytime soon. there just arent enough good games like dayz
[2023-01-09 13:32:21] <%+Bravoalltheway> dayz players r different from rust players for sure
[2023-01-09 13:32:26] <yungcrackmaster> have you ever thought about playing sea of thieves? I've been playing it lately and I gotta say it's a great game

[2023-01-09 13:32:33] <$milanbaros2004> there is this game called Super Mario World, and I think thats really gonna catch on

[2023-01-09 13:32:43] <%LordRoastbeef> For an almost 10 year old game, DayZ is doing just fine.

[2023-01-09 13:58:30] <%aspzan> I felt he was saying how the taliban basically became just a target to him as opposed to a human being

[2023-01-09 13:58:47] <%+Delta1292> There's a point where they run out of shit to say at some point, not sure what they'll do then, most 'celebrities' do the tell all at the end of their career rather than the start

[2023-01-09 14:22:42] <+SlotRacer> @onikem most views come from suggestions based on likes
[2023-01-09 14:22:42] <+fogger80> seems like here on twitch its 10% of followers are the ones watching.
[2023-01-09 14:22:43] <+DanteThaScrub> Personally I feel more of a ‚Äòbond‚Äô, even responsibility, to support my favourite Twitch streamers than I do for anything on YT
[2023-01-09 14:22:45] <%Maddog00427> My YT Shortcut is my Sub Feed
[2023-01-09 14:22:50] <%aspzan> there's a recommended smaller communities thing on the page sometimes
[2023-01-09 14:22:51] <%MYERNLANSKI> its always people singing on the home page for me
[2023-01-09 14:23:08] <%WorldOfCracraft> what is the point in subbing to a youtuber if you don't get their vids
[2023-01-09 14:23:11] <Beefy_Comb> My biggest video has over 200k views and I have no idea how, the video sucks lol
[2023-01-09 14:23:13] <%Meerkat_Troop> Most of the time I watch you live on twitch so I don‚Äôt feel the need to go watch it on YouTube
[2023-01-09 14:23:13] <chez_tickoff> I do. I‚Äôm currently working through your back catalogue of videos. üòÄ
[2023-01-09 14:23:13] <%+jtscreens> So is it best to just buy ads?
[2023-01-09 14:23:18] <%DefoAnoob> I get small channels recommended to me all them time, Its not based on time put in but on the specific category your viewing...
[2023-01-09 14:23:22] <v1r3_> This actually helped meXD
[2023-01-09 14:23:24] <%+tompty767> A hint of pretention.

[2023-01-09 14:23:29] <%+xzzrxmasternoob> I only watch you tube when u on holiday‚Ä¶ twich consumes most of my time
[2023-01-09 14:23:34] <+ryanarchyy> Weirdly Twitch advertises a lot of those hot tub streams though...
[2023-01-09 14:23:50] <%Giantcrab078> since when do coffee shops sell coffee ü§≠
[2023-01-09 14:23:50] <+fogger80> TikTok short vids draws them to Twitch
[2023-01-09 14:23:54] <+onikem> I run 2 businesses advertising is a nightmare
[2023-01-09 14:24:03] <%skiritairgr> But wouldn‚Äôt be in Twitch‚Äôs best interest to recommend similar streamers to what you searched? To keep you on the platform for longer.
[2023-01-09 14:24:03] <%+jtscreens> I get banned promoting on Reddit - but yeah - I use social media - but likely need to buy ads for socials
[2023-01-09 14:24:11] <+rpk2012> @TheRunningManZ is Melee that slow?
[2023-01-09 14:24:15] <%+J_U_L_E_S> @ryanarchyy Because they get a high amout of views (for obvious reasons) which generates a lot of ad revenue
[2023-01-09 14:24:16] <kaosokris> sure thing, I don't open the dayz overview very often to pick a stream, when I want to watch dayz...and I also rarely pick the streamer with the highest viewer count tbh
[2023-01-09 14:24:19] <%+museabear> when we get a hot tub stream from trmz?
[2023-01-09 14:24:21] <greatape1970> very quiet for players
[2023-01-09 14:24:24] <patientzero1974> youtube keep showing me new dayz creators most with only 1 or 2 thousand subs, especially when it comes to shorts these days

[2023-01-09 14:24:39] <%+Willdo1983> the problem with tiktok is people say on tiktok as they want short videos
[2023-01-09 14:24:43] <%+jtscreens> However - strangely enough - my audience is 18-40 - and the only explanation is that kids are using their parent's accounts because I making Minecraft and roblox content.

[2023-01-09 14:25:19] <$luktac> that is true

[2023-01-09 14:25:20] <%+lorcan_cs> tiktok is just the wrong audience. people on tiktok just want unlimited swiping content
[2023-01-09 14:25:21] <+servixkilla> spot on
[2023-01-09 14:25:23] <+benjamindevil274> Because Tik Tok isn't memorable
[2023-01-09 14:25:27] <+jigglenaut> I'm here from TikTok. Your dances are the shit. Very hot.
[2023-01-09 14:25:28] <kaosokris> tiktok and youtube shorts are cancer in terms of wasting more time you wanted to. :D
[2023-01-09 14:25:28] <!%AmishZed> @TheRunningManZ are you getting on the YT short train this year?
[2023-01-09 14:25:32] <+ryanarchyy> TikTok is great if you're 15
[2023-01-09 14:25:33] <weirdoshrine> why people open themselves to theft via tik tok makes no sense to me

[2023-01-09 14:29:10] <!%AmishZed> @DBearIt might want to look at other shorts that are doing well and see what they are up to. I think music, subtitles, zooms to emphasize spotting players/action beats can help a lot

[2023-01-09 14:49:15] <+LastKarmaSC2> i work to making mobile payments make cards obsolete - cards are just money for nothing when you have the internet
[2023-01-09 14:49:15] <%$Berwynning> there are some businesses that have lost their right to transact with cards due to violating contracts
[2023-01-09 14:49:15] <%+tompty767> @TheRunningManZ I'd say the larger cost is that people like me will actually avoid cash only establishments.
[2023-01-09 14:49:17] <+onikem> I pay 1.2% of a transaction

[2023-01-09 14:57:13] <%+reedy2frames> Yeah needs to just wind it in a bit. That backwards film he did was a bit too much.
[2023-01-09 14:57:15] <fixmytoaster76> i am become bomb destroyer of worlds
[2023-01-09 14:57:17] <%$jpat1993> As someone who works in the Nuclear Sector, everyone I work with is absolutely stoked to see it
[2023-01-09 14:57:21] <quick_sh_t> Nolan's a genius.  But if he would stop trying to show us how brilliant he is, his movies would be  just delicious.
[2023-01-09 14:57:26] <slyvren> Christian Bale was the best batman. Fight me!
[2023-01-09 14:57:26] <%+soupy_poops> 1917 is way better than Dunkirk
[2023-01-09 14:57:30] <%+stevethesleeve13> 1917 was good
[2023-01-09 14:57:38] <mrbrownpants888> Dunkirk could've been amazing but ended up being frustrating
[2023-01-09 14:57:40] <+jamieorr> Good afternoon everyone :) hope you had a great weekend
[2023-01-09 14:57:42] <!%AmishZed> loved 1917
[2023-01-09 14:57:42] <+RonalGN> It ended up boring tbh
[2023-01-09 14:57:55] <!%AmishZed> I gotta see All Quiet on the Western Front
[2023-01-09 14:57:57] <kenoath_17> Agreed about Dunkirk
[2023-01-09 14:57:59] <jimdon3610> The remake of all quiet on the western front is a decent watch on Netflix
[2023-01-09 14:57:59] <%Curty> ever seen Memento? Superb Nolan film
[2023-01-09 14:58:00] <Verumatic> Travelling through a black hole, in order to enter the 4th dimension where he uses strings to manipulate gravity is cool and stuff but that‚Äôs not really how you‚Äôd think science would work LUL

[2023-01-09 14:58:26] <%+LucidPuck> Nolan definitely wants to show a big picture through a narrow lens. It's his jam
[2023-01-09 14:58:27] <+TheOscillator> When I watched Interstellar in the Cinema the mix was horrible and it ruined it for me despite is having an amazing soundtrack.
[2023-01-09 14:58:28] <%+xzzrxmasternoob> 1917 and the German latest ww1 was great
[2023-01-09 14:58:28] <%00mehmet7> band of brothers is the peak @TheRunningManZ
[2023-01-09 14:58:34] <quick_sh_t> Yes @Curty  But that was young Non recognized Nolan.

[2023-01-09 14:59:08] <%pnutbutternjamm> I had very high hopes for dunkirk watched it twice hoping it would‚Äôve gotten better

[2023-01-09 15:01:01] <1sirlegion1> mye true, liked it though dunkirk maybe it was to show the doubt and struggle for the eng army as they were stuck and had no idea what was going on behind them. and also give the audience that feeling

[2023-01-09 15:02:54] <!%AmishZed> @slyvren it really isn't. I think DK suffers from things outside its control. Recasting Rachel made me not give 1 tiny fuck about her death, and the ending with Joker just hanging there is so anticlimatic. Its not their fault for either of those things but it still affects the movie
[2023-01-09 15:02:59] <Simon_Kay> @skiritairgr  there is a season of it in HBO, atleast for me

I wanted to add for me it messes me up alot. if you have more than one thing as you aim it seemingly randomly chooses what it locks to. or if something runs in front of me it'll snap to that a little bit. I hate it. so I turned it off. seems to feel like that for me on most games. I don't like it.

[2023-01-09 15:37:49] <kaosokris> ppl recommend that to me on several, but even if probably a bunch of ppl do it, that's cheating imo and what paul says
[2023-01-09 15:37:51] <%skiritairgr> @k0tt0nmouth Yeah, it‚Äôs quite good.
[2023-01-09 15:37:59] <SpriteQc> I can't blame new players, but experienced players shouldn't be afraid of a little night time
[2023-01-09 15:38:01] <+thediplomat> it's totally an exploit. it's basically cheating. to turn up gamma.

[2023-01-09 15:38:30] <%+two_teezy> How does nighttime work?  As far as timing of when is it night and how long is it night?
[2023-01-09 15:38:33] <%+wyattxearp> That‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt play Ark survival anymore because you can change the gamma
[2023-01-09 15:38:41] <Lishka_84> I mean in IRL if you were trying to survive, you can‚Äôt just switch the gamma lol

[2023-01-09 15:39:08] <%+RedSniper6> Yeah only reason to play games like this is to test your skills vs someone else‚Äôs. If you making it easier for you then how can you ever know if you are good

[2023-01-09 15:43:52] <+SirJimiee> dayz nights whilst using a headtorch is scary shit lol, feels like a horror game

[2023-01-09 15:43:53] <sniperon777> trmzEpic you should help design a new map for this game since you've been around for so many years

[2023-01-09 15:47:53] <kaosokris> the south of livonia is kind of empty and the north castle is a joke in terms of size and loot, but it's quite alright, if you like the thick vegetation and more summer time like vibes

[2023-01-09 15:50:45] <%Helo0931> @SobeliciousTV His concern with this is that it takes a fair bit of time to get comfortable and the editor to learn his style. It would take longer to get an alternate then before normal editor will be back.

[2023-01-09 16:00:06] <kaytrae091215> it would be cool if ppl would release the unedited footage along side the edited footage you could actually see what it takes to make these videos

[2023-01-09 16:08:27] <@%^Nightbot> Take time exploring the map, don't worry about getting all the loots. Follow roads or power lines to towns, find a road sign with a towns name and use an external map to navigate with !maps. Stay warm and dry! Zombies often have food, drinks and tools on them. If you aren't finding loot in a town someone might have just been through it, move on to the next town. Always remember that gear comes and goes, everyone dies, and to Have Fun!

[2023-01-09 17:08:16] <+dopimane> I think EV isn't sustainable and the move is to be "renewable" but it's not. All its putting on is another stress demand on a different resource we have not implemented the infrastructure for. Hybrids would be a sustainable interim I feel

[2023-01-09 17:09:31] <KizzaR33> what annoys me is Telsa drivers parking in the petrol pumps, so they can go shopping
[2023-01-09 17:09:31] <+komikxx> I think the most difficult aspect of EV‚Äôs is that many people live in apartments or condos and don‚Äôt have a charging device close by. And at least where I live, the infrastructure for charging is just not sufficient if everyone had an EV. That‚Äôs changing, but not that quickly. Just my 2 cents worth
[2023-01-09 17:09:33] <%gnoah> Im all about electric cars, but they don't take or hold charges well in VERY cold which is where i live
[2023-01-09 17:09:41] <%+tompty767> @TheRunningManZ Im planning driving from Stoke to Exeter. Only needs a 15 min charge there, and one on the way back.
[2023-01-09 17:09:49] <%nickraz89> my mum and dad drove to souther Spain from Leeds in there EV at 62 years old, planned the journey beforehand, not a single.l issue

[2023-01-09 17:09:57] <+nomadyow> you're right.  Its the worst part of owning an EV.  That said it isn't really that bad

[2023-01-09 17:09:59] <%DefoAnoob> My 2020 civic gets about 10 mpg, but theres also a turbo the size of a canteloupe and a 6 speed.. LuL
[2023-01-09 17:09:59] <%+CheesePuffJay> Even then, you stop to charge and stretch your legs every about 400-500kms and it takes about 20 minutes to go to 80 %

[2023-01-09 17:59:15] <@%^Nightbot> Take time exploring the map, don't worry about getting all the loots. Follow roads or power lines to towns, find a road sign with a towns name and use an external map to navigate with !maps. Stay warm and dry! Zombies often have food, drinks and tools on them. If you aren't finding loot in a town someone might have just been through it, move on to the next town. Always remember that gear comes and goes, everyone dies, and to Have Fun!

[2023-01-09 18:09:13] <%+Goalieguy16> @VaggosFTW field backpack has a MUCH larger footprint and is hard to look back over your shoulder with. The hunting backpack is much more ideal even though you lose a few inventory spots.

[2023-01-09 20:27:05] <ketel1_06484> Inertia is the idea that an object will continue its current motion until some force causes its speed or direction to change.

I used to use Mid-Roll ads, but want to know if it's possible to have them automated so I don't have to hit the button myself every 30 odd minutes.

[2023-01-09 21:08:10] <%+xzzrxmasternoob> @groovy_vibes626 Lol good one heheh .. no the bigger boom ones no schrapnel
[2023-01-09 21:08:13] <SpriteQc> @BobbyFrickinGold Only explodes if the vest gets damaged and that ruins the grenade. It's been tested and you can't shoot a grenade on your backpack to explode it
[2023-01-09 21:08:20] <%VertigoMoose> I bet they will have a scope for you if you are able to get in.
[2023-01-09 21:08:22] <+JETT_CXIII> You can put 9+ walls in the fortress house.

[2023-01-09 21:10:59] <%th1ccdaddy42069> you dont need the repair kit with just one plastic explosive!
[2023-01-09 21:11:08] <%+mogamosch> It's called plastic surgery
[2023-01-09 21:11:17] <%+B1g_Larry> @GamesByAndy Closed now
[2023-01-09 21:11:18] <%Kranacus> I think the ak alone might take a wooden wall, with all that ammo
[2023-01-09 21:11:21] <%+admiralredbuli> the claymores are directional so they can damage through mutliple walls I think
[2023-01-09 21:11:31] <%JUSTmorgz> You don‚Äôt need the elec kit or the box though, can just set them to the detonator
[2023-01-09 21:11:31] <smoothhhoperator> Surely a claymore should take a wooden wall down ‚Ä¶
[2023-01-09 21:11:42] <%+admiralredbuli> wothr bearing in mind though :)
[2023-01-09 21:11:44] <%th1ccdaddy42069> you can pair the detonator to the plastic explosive itself without the repair kit and protector case
[2023-01-09 21:11:54] <%Kranacus> Its two claymores i understand
[2023-01-09 21:11:55] <%JUSTmorgz> Claymores are weak
[2023-01-09 21:12:00] <%old_dawgz> its all in the placement
[2023-01-09 21:12:01] <%+Omni_Rage_> 1 claymore = 2 grenade
[2023-01-09 21:12:01] <+BudgeQT> @therunningmanz i just had a conversation with my gf about your age. how old are you? :)
[2023-01-09 21:12:03] <%+xzzrxmasternoob> Can u ruin the plastic explosives and then blow em up with like nade or claymore?
[2023-01-09 21:12:08] <%cherriesjubileeee> from my experience claymore don't do much damage
[2023-01-09 21:12:15] <%$Mezza_5> @therunningmanz be careful with the claymore, last time I tried it didn't touch the wall but ruined all the containers on the other side LUL
[2023-01-09 21:12:18] <%+DocRavage> took me 2 and a few shots to do 1 wall but i'm pretty sure i was able to aim it at the backside

[2023-01-09 21:32:53] <DaveTheRave81> im a united fan & agree with ya about if ur talking over the career then giggs but at the p0eak u cant split them & as for wales qualifying for more tournaments i think bale had a much btter squad with him so that doesn't mean anything
[2023-01-09 21:32:56] <%+metabollock> There wouldn't have been a Bale if Harry Redknapp had anything to do with it. Played him as a left back..I think
[2023-01-09 21:33:07] <%Skaz_> I'm saying that some players pave the way for others, regardless of if they're "better" or not. But Giggs played footie in a whole different kind of environment than Bale. You can't really compare the two imo.
[2023-01-09 21:33:09] <%TovesPlays> Arguably that Bale goal against Liverpool was a different class - maybe the best ever in a champions league final

[2023-01-09 21:44:22] <%TovesPlays> I mean a Messi 10 runs the game I guess
[2023-01-09 21:44:23] <%+galasteve> But each position needs certain skills.  Just because you‚Äôre the BEST BALL player, doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre the best actual player in your team.    I‚Äôve played on plenty teams when the best ball player isn‚Äôt the best or most effective player on the team .

[2023-01-09 21:51:37] <+drewb007> i was just thinking ,,, hmm player, lets climb a ladder
[2023-01-09 21:51:39] <%+Tuktanuk> Brave.... Stupis would be is you got tapped up there.
[2023-01-09 21:51:42] <%earlyburd724> don't forget your m16 is on burst
[2023-01-09 21:51:44] <+rogerrabbit_xx> how did you ladder slide?
[2023-01-09 21:51:45] <%skepticalio> what if zombie killed the chicken
[2023-01-09 21:51:53] <+TheSpaceMunkey> yeah man skylineing u have the advantage on the ground if they aint got NV's
[2023-01-09 21:51:53] <%+admiralredbuli> you can cut the chicken and see what state the thighs are in
[2023-01-09 21:51:53] <peter_parker_jr> Which despawns first, the chicken or the egg?
[2023-01-09 21:51:57] <bagoballz> are you likely to die by sporter shot carrying all those nades?
[2023-01-09 21:51:59] <%+evilmaniacx> zeds kill chickens right
[2023-01-09 21:52:04] <%BballsDoug> why do you keep switching off nvg? looking for lights?
[2023-01-09 21:52:05] <%Kranacus> You can use the sledge to help start?
[2023-01-09 21:52:06] <%+B1g_Larry> @Killswitch_DZG Tennessee Pe-con
[2023-01-09 21:52:07] <weedianer> ohhhhh...

[2023-01-09 21:52:19] <%spalmann> if wolves are now getting zombies, could they be getting chickens too
[2023-01-09 21:52:20] <5mok3420> the person around might have heard the heli crash and went for it ??
[2023-01-09 21:52:20] <ballinbig2001> I bet that bad man that just shot has more explosives
[2023-01-09 21:52:24] <romulusmarshall> @evilmaniacx They dont, only animal they dont

[2023-01-09 22:04:38] <%$tysalt9> My mom and pops used to always say how they hated buying tyson fights, under cards were bad and the fight was over in the first @TheRunningManZ
[2023-01-09 22:04:42] <%+galasteve> I‚Äôm gonna sound old just now - but the old PPV undercards used to normally be great.  Now the whole thing is a fucking scam . Not only is the undercard shite - but the main event is normally something that is barely worthy of the local hall
[2023-01-09 22:04:54] <%Helo0931> If you go see UFC live, the fights before they start showing televised are WAY better.

[2023-01-09 22:11:29] <CameIYogurt> wouldn't they have to kill DayZ's servers if they want a DayZ 2 to succeed?
[2023-01-09 22:11:31] <@%+XMugshotX> @midlander1 New Hampshire as well
[2023-01-09 22:11:34] <%Kranacus> There is still federal taxes
[2023-01-09 22:11:35] <%$itsmeobee> honestly, I feel modders are doing maps often enough and so well I'm good with days for quite a while

[2023-01-09 22:11:42] <drinkable1mp> but other tax is higher so it equals out

[2023-01-09 22:12:06] <ZBadMice> ill be up for some of that
[2023-01-09 22:12:07] <%+DarnellJenkins> People also freeze or burn to death in Texas. It also has the highest infant mortality rate in the US
[2023-01-09 22:12:07] <thejmacdeezy> Day Z player base seems like it has been rising again, which is good to see
[2023-01-09 22:12:11] <%bottomsneeze> @ghoste_mindset Pretty sure that was a troll account...
[2023-01-09 22:12:13] <%vikingNOR> when arma 4 comes out someone will make some cool mods
[2023-01-09 22:12:13] <klumtera> dayZ 2 means more marketing, potentially funding then they would get from fixing dayZ 1
[2023-01-09 22:12:16] <p2wftl> property taxes in texas aye $5000 a year on a $175,000 house LUL
[2023-01-09 22:12:17] <CaptCaique> Texas may not have state income tax but their property tax makes up for it.

[2023-01-09 22:12:42] <%+Yowutup11> @Etxercba There's still federal income tax. sales tax. real estate tax. gas tax. license plate tax. death tax.
[2023-01-09 22:12:49] <@%+XMugshotX> There are a few states w no income tax,usually prpoerty taxes are higher instead
[2023-01-09 22:12:49] <CameIYogurt> it's understandable considering where it was and where it is.
[2023-01-09 22:12:52] <%$itsmeobee> for me honestly its the gun play.. idk why but I love how it feels. I played cod recently and couldn't stand it. just like the challenge of day's gunplay

[2023-01-09 22:13:34] <%Helo0931> Oregon has no sales tax, but has a huge income tax
[2023-01-09 22:13:34] <+Etxercba> @p2wftl nah. It depends on location. My house is 245,000 and I pay 3k for property tax with the Homestead exemption applied.

[2023-01-09 22:13:48] <%berulfsen> One logical reason to have developers working on fixing issues in DayZ today is that there are real plans for the future, and they need to keep the community fairly happy.

Calling a person a cumberwold, fopdoodle or a dalcop, whilst appearing earnest and considered, serves to confound the synaptically challenged. What perverse joy!

[2023-01-09 22:37:15] <hotbox_marvel> Tis but a flesh wound

[2023-01-09 22:40:18] <%$JitteryJava> @therunningmanz maybe that‚Äôs why there are so many bases on this server
[2023-01-09 22:40:18] <%$l1qu1d> I still think base building in Dayz, esp in cities/places of interest are stupid and ruin the game more
[2023-01-09 22:40:19] <%+smiggsyy> You tried knocking?
[2023-01-09 22:40:20] <%Mercuryhot> any one read the server rules and see if base raiding was on?

[2023-01-09 22:40:25] <yumust_bejokin> Moral of the story kids- play on no base servers
[2023-01-09 22:40:25] <%dude3ro> thats bs
[2023-01-09 22:40:25] <KizzaR33> should have boobytrapped it
[2023-01-09 22:40:26] <%freshco420> well that's a real shame
[2023-01-09 22:40:26] <%0ctomore> why have multiple walls if theres no basedamage?
[2023-01-09 22:40:30] <%DurnnikB83> try knockimg and asking if they heard the good word
[2023-01-09 22:40:31] <%+Jay_Grand> @therunningmanz it‚Äôs on then just not working for some reason
[2023-01-09 22:40:31] <%cherriesjubileeee> lame

[2023-01-09 22:40:48] <%bottomsneeze> The pumpkin farmers had a base near here
[2023-01-09 22:40:48] <+Dr_dayZed> Ive dropped 2 c4 and 10 grenades on a door and nothing, some doorways absorb the damage. you can still raid them by shooting and melee
[2023-01-09 22:40:50] <%+trina3333> surely n axe or sledge hammer be better than bullets
[2023-01-09 22:40:51] <%+SuemooSlays> Knock and tell them you're Mormon
[2023-01-09 22:40:51] <%+123rdtheherd> Base damage off?  Is that a thing?
[2023-01-09 22:40:52] <ihmemie5> @mountaingoat2902 there is times when you can raid. Like 5pm to 10pm

[2023-01-09 22:41:01] <vincentadam87> @l1qu1d all you need is an axe, nothing wrong with bases tbh
[2023-01-09 22:41:03] <%+DangerKev> Find a parkour way in
[2023-01-09 22:41:03] <%+BugattiOG> what building mod are they using?
[2023-01-09 22:41:04] <%DoinWork369> you just have to say the magic words
[2023-01-09 22:41:04] <+Etxercba> Some servers only allow base raiding on weekends. It‚Äôs lame
[2023-01-09 22:41:07] <%+Jay_Grand> Shooting would be better but you‚Äôve used too many grenades now anyway
[2023-01-09 22:41:09] <%freshco420> they may have found the ultimate place for a base lol
[2023-01-09 22:41:10] <mobius1989> @123rdtheherd yeah
[2023-01-09 22:41:10] <@%Dark_Wing_DuckZ> Ok i gonna delete the prediction to get everyones points back

[2023-01-09 22:41:10] <MyrphMayhem> So does that count as him getting to raid the base or no?
[2023-01-09 22:41:12] <%+mountaingoat2902> @ihmemie5 ah yea that makes sense
[2023-01-09 22:41:13] <%JUSTmorgz> That‚Äôs cheaty as fuck that base
[2023-01-09 22:41:14] <FreeKingLife> This server is so bad why u add claymore and nade :/
[2023-01-09 22:41:16] <mbbb7> maybe its raid weekend
[2023-01-09 22:41:16] <kauvertrag> There are some arguments for bases but overall they are lmae
[2023-01-09 22:41:17] <the_runningboyz> 11,000 hour on DayZ player try to raid a base with fist bump
[2023-01-09 22:41:19] <+nickmcdouble> Have to hit the lock
[2023-01-09 22:41:19] <+TheFnReif> I‚Äôve heard if majority of wall is covered like that, explosives won‚Äôt work.
[2023-01-09 22:41:21] <thejmacdeezy> unfortunate
[2023-01-09 22:41:23] <kaosfeare> You no longer penetrate panels with bullets

[2023-01-09 22:41:33] <%Ninepills> @therunningmanz there maybe certain raiding times on the server
[2023-01-09 22:41:36] <krisggm> @123rdtheherd if base damage is off, it doenst make a sound if you punch the wall
[2023-01-09 22:41:42] <%+Mike_D_29> Why would base damage be turned off like that?
[2023-01-09 22:41:48] <ihmemie5> @mountaingoat2902 ye thats good invention to people who have to go work or school etc
[2023-01-09 22:41:50] <%DurnnikB83> wasn't there another base near by worth trying?
[2023-01-09 22:41:53] <+Etxercba> @timtomomnom some servers only allow base raiding on weekends
[2023-01-09 22:41:55] <%+Jay_Grand> Noise when punching means it‚Äôs not turned off
[2023-01-09 22:41:58] <%+123rdtheherd> @weedianer I see
[2023-01-09 22:42:01] <%Lenkerbecker450> at least the planks must be off after that
[2023-01-09 22:42:03] <%+BugattiOG> if its vanilla, they must have raid weekend on
[2023-01-09 22:42:05] <@%Dark_Wing_DuckZ> B1g_Larry also chat everyone should have get their points back
[2023-01-09 22:42:05] <%+therealcow1122> Some servers have no base damage
[2023-01-09 22:42:06] <+myth147> @therunningmanz i thought the right side frame showed yellow but i could be wrong

[2023-01-09 22:42:11] <%+OldManDave33> no base dmg is kinda shit if thats a thing
[2023-01-09 22:42:16] <%Helo0931> @Mike_D_29 Cause people cry that someone took all their stashed loot
[2023-01-09 22:42:17] <dylooooooooo> Damage is defiantly on as you punched and it connected with the fence

[2023-01-09 22:42:28] <%SansaS9280> it will be raidweekends
[2023-01-09 22:42:30] <%+Jay_Grand> Damage is on if it makes a noise when punching guys
[2023-01-09 22:42:31] <%JUSTmorgz> Would of said when you selected it if it had dumb shit like that

[2023-01-09 22:42:33] <@%^Nightbot> SERVER: The server name, IP, or other info such as what mods an individual server has will not be given as this info can help people to find the server TRMZ is playing on. Thanks
[2023-01-09 22:42:33] <MunjaLightning> TheRunningManZ well i did vanilla on namalsk, "official servers" and it took time to destroy the doors
[2023-01-09 22:42:33] <hplovecraft1984> @oldmandave33 it's been a thing for years
[2023-01-09 22:42:34] <Paradise_X0> Blocking a castle is so shit tbh
[2023-01-09 22:42:35] <+TimTomOmNom> @Etxercba god thats awful haha. Thanks
[2023-01-09 22:42:37] <%+gringo_smoker> whoever runs it defo has a big chad base on prison
[2023-01-09 22:42:37] <+housjeee> Damage was on. You nearly got it.
[2023-01-09 22:42:40] <%marens77> Maybe relog? damage indicator was just bugged ?

[2023-01-09 22:42:46] <%DurnnikB83> I found dropped nades never work on doors
[2023-01-09 22:42:57] <riffle_man> Probably only allowed to raid on the weekend
[2023-01-09 22:43:00] <slapsdayz> it's more than likey the server owner has put the damage up needed to get in, the stuff you used should have put that gate to damaged!
[2023-01-09 22:43:01] <$idealbicycle741> nearly every xbox official server has a base in that castle
[2023-01-09 22:43:03] <+HighLifeSA> Just wait for them to come back and grenade them , not the door
[2023-01-09 22:43:03] <+Etxercba> The would have heard that for sure.
[2023-01-09 22:43:03] <%Lenkerbecker450> @areon135 the bunker is worst blocking it
[2023-01-09 22:43:05] <%+PaxedUP> maybe toss the grenades over the door? idk

[2023-01-09 22:43:21] <%+Psyphon20> well it sounds like a better use of your explosives
[2023-01-09 22:43:24] <%sinfullives> Some servers also only allow raiding with c4
[2023-01-09 22:43:25] <%$RoShamBoPro> surely they couldve heard the attempted raid
[2023-01-09 22:43:26] <%+drskinners> wasn't there a busted base down south just off the road.
[2023-01-09 22:43:27] <%+linde2021> You need to build a base here. No offline raiding on trmz base then :)
[2023-01-09 22:43:29] <%Undeadwilly13> HypeSleep I was napping, I see we got tired of the bases trmzLove

[2023-01-09 22:43:30] <%+mr_smaII> Same happened to me raiding castle Krona with grenades. It‚Äôs almost like the nades are dropping through the floor
[2023-01-09 22:43:31] <%+Mike_D_29> @helo0931 they should defend their base then LUL
[2023-01-09 22:43:33] <mobius1989> A lot of dayz servers have discords with rules and settings
[2023-01-09 22:43:36] <%tyBOGit> @thegooddoctor88 Good visuals
[2023-01-09 22:43:36] <@%Feast_130> @DurnnikB83 worked fine for Paul the other day at the prison
[2023-01-09 22:43:37] <%+K9Dboy> ask them about raids
[2023-01-09 22:43:38] <%manditheos> a non damage base server usually is on the server name
[2023-01-09 22:43:40] <%$BlondeNemmyMurders> @crossbow81 LUL
[2023-01-09 22:43:42] <ridd13_> tress down so recently

[2023-01-09 22:43:50] <%+PaxedUP> "When an 11,000 hour streamer attacks an admins base"
[2023-01-09 22:43:54] <megakap82> Tried on a base. But you should‚Äôve seen some kind of damage with the grenades. I was a part of an admin team and we had these damage off due to the server running base rate every second weekend
[2023-01-09 22:43:56] <%yoGDubbz> don't you have tacticle goggles?
[2023-01-09 22:43:58] <CameIYogurt> @idealbicycle741 i hate castle bases, my solo non building self will be trotting through the woods excited to get a rifle or just get a high vantage point and some assholes had to go and claim it themselves
[2023-01-09 22:43:59] <kauvertrag> Some servers increase building hp, I think it is this one
[2023-01-09 22:44:00] <%+B1g_Larry> Did you try "Open Sesame? "
[2023-01-09 22:44:02] <%ikeozzzy> Correct that‚Äôs how you get the configs
[2023-01-09 22:44:05] <+Etxercba> Put on your goggles to get rid of the god rays
[2023-01-09 22:44:06] <%+galasteve> tybogit spent all day trying to get geared to raid the base of the fucker that killed him yesterday.   101 DayZ content.    Ruined by some glltch or server mod ?
[2023-01-09 22:44:08] <%+zoyen_> mmm chopped trees...
[2023-01-09 22:44:13] <thejmacdeezy> If it was turned off or like weekends only, I am sure it would have been in the description
[2023-01-09 22:44:14] <%+PaxedUP> it's probably just like that metal gate at the prison like the other day

[2023-01-09 22:44:22] <%+mountaingoat2902> you could kill them here when they have it unlocked
[2023-01-09 22:44:23] <%$conor_dangles> Yea that is odd no damage was being done
[2023-01-09 22:44:24] <scttmartin> @therunningmanz do you still have the goggles?
[2023-01-09 22:44:24] <%yoGDubbz> someone is hammering
[2023-01-09 22:44:27] <potatoshottz> some servers have a red base raid hammer ,ive seen og with one a while back

[2023-01-09 23:13:17] <%+pickupthecan> work for ambulance service, people abuse the system, call an ambulance out after leaving a common or chronic problem for weeks because they cant get a doctor to manage it before it gets any worse. Common sense and ability to manage  simple everyday illness.

[2023-01-09 23:14:09] <scootergoat98> I worked in a bar and did the same work and the people around me but they earned ¬£2.10 more than me because they were over 24
[2023-01-09 23:14:11] <youhitlikearadroach> NHS are bands and band 5 nurses not picking up shifts and working days are likely to struggle more
[2023-01-09 23:14:15] <%Hard_Pegger> under staffed and under paid are usually connected
[2023-01-09 23:14:16] <%+neilthegreat2710> @BlondeNemmyMurders Some nurses in Canada can make that much.

[2023-01-09 23:14:21] <%+galasteve> @pickupthecan my good friend is also a para.   He is demoralised by the way that the ambulance service is actually utilised and how much resource is wasted by repeat offenders and nonsense

[2023-01-09 23:14:27] <%nickbean01> anyone that isn't a nurse shouldn't be suggesting they're getting the pay they deserve. the working hours and conditions are INSANE for any amount of money
