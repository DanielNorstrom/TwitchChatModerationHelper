[2023-01-03 21:54:22] <%gilver1> Tumblr was crap towards the end

[2023-01-03 21:54:29] <@%$midnightidiot> the porn purge
[2023-01-03 21:54:38] <+Atheta_> honestly I prefer pixiv because it's more of a gallery and less "let me preach my opinions and ideologies" like twitter and tumblr
[2023-01-03 21:54:47] <%nateify> deviantart is where i made my first "internet friends"
[2023-01-03 21:54:51] <%+Zorthak_Rakira> @maximum_meatball Instagram is good for some things but I wouldn't say art is one of them

[2023-01-03 22:22:19] <suumcuiquesic> @MoorieceSalty Fair point. I just figure since Scarlet is a succubus (gives that vibe anyway) and Synth is one aswell they're probably bi/pan since IMO it makes sense seeing as how succubi are the epitomy of seggsual attraction, eroticism and lewd.
