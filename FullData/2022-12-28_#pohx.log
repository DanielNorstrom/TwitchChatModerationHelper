If playing softcore it's easy to get good gear

[2022-12-28 16:17:51] <@%donavanshepard> yeah once you get a chestpiece it feels literally unkillable in maps
[2022-12-28 16:17:54] <lexats> wait chat, how many rooms of sanc can you do in 1 map?
[2022-12-28 16:17:57] <@%donavanshepard> 1
[2022-12-28 16:18:57] <shado712> it pains me to see you leave coins :< i know you dotn need all of them but still
[2022-12-28 16:19:25] <@%donavanshepard> coin drops should be numerically meaningful
[2022-12-28 16:19:26] <%lizardawg> Pohx's RF guide and work with the website is the most comprehensive guide ever put out for POE. I think these points are covered quite well if you take the time to read through them. Thanks for all that work Pohx, and thank you more for just being a genuine cool person.
[2022-12-28 16:19:29] <@%donavanshepard> not coin shards
[2022-12-28 16:19:33] VIEWERS: 410
[2022-12-28 16:19:46] <%CutterSnake> And I feel like u can modify the Build he provides so much tho. As an example I switched to Explode and still have 5 MIo Boss DPS so I think you can be tacky and still got enough damage.
[2022-12-28 16:19:47] <earthsdefect> yeah not even single target. Clear feels bad and honestly feels like missed opportunities in the tree with more damage nodes. Getting good gear with damage mutli and is harder then getting gear with resistance and life/armour etc, that's why I feel like it's missed opportunities in the tree for more damage.
[2022-12-28 16:19:52] <mickeymutt> not worth it
[2022-12-28 16:20:09] <shado712> i agree, im just a horder

[2022-12-28 16:20:45] <Firebird142002> @Pohx I happened to get a mageblood, what would you suggest is the best variant of RF to use it on? I would like something tanky/fast
[2022-12-28 16:20:47] <+MikedUpGaming> It's freaking insase
[2022-12-28 16:20:48] <Phobiuspl> whats your tooltip dps on rf right now?
[2022-12-28 16:20:49] <Rage487> @earthsdefect there is plenty of damage in the build. I'm at lvl 93 and instakill most packs of mobs.
[2022-12-28 16:21:02] <Vivald> I put 5 divines into the build and jump into t16 at lvl 73 with a clear of around 3mins
[2022-12-28 16:21:15] <Frogg_y> why would you ever drop barbarism
[2022-12-28 16:21:28] <Frogg_y> yeah i read
[2022-12-28 16:21:31] <@%donavanshepard> The build does everything you would want to do just fine, and its easy for newer players to grasp the build.

[2022-12-28 16:23:10] <%lizardawg> This isn't the best build to ever for POE but it is the best covered and represented for what it is. Furthermore, the attitude is what I find the most appealing, be who you are, and do what makes you happy. You will receive a great community experience here, and for that I am very grateful.
[2022-12-28 16:23:20] <+kessler112> yeah reduce action speed is better here, make them super slow
[2022-12-28 16:23:21] <mickeymutt> fire pen good for RF?

[2022-12-28 16:23:58] <%CutterSnake> True 100% knowledge! As an example I have Frenzy on Kill with a Brutal Restraint on Barbarism so it is Offense AND defense, Dex for Days so I can have more Res on Gear so less Pieces needed for Res = more Room for more Offensive Mods. As you said ... 100% Knowledge.
[2022-12-28 16:24:02] <mickeymutt> nvm.. i figured it out.. good for fire trap not RF
[2022-12-28 16:24:03] <+lzopian_fury> I know in your guide it says to be higher end of lvling for the unstoppable over Unyielding, do you think taking Unstappable early is okay to do if it fits well with where I am currently Sub lvl 80
[2022-12-28 16:24:08] <earthsdefect> 5 divines to run t16 is alot of investment.
[2022-12-28 16:24:38] <earthsdefect> that's what someone else said they've put into it

[2022-12-28 16:25:32] <Vivald> @earthsdefect I didnt need it to run t16, It was my 3rd build this season, and my point was. I runned t16 at lvl 73 with 3 min clear no death

[2022-12-28 16:28:02] <%CutterSnake> Ok i am out of this discussion XD I explained why this node can be offensive as well, what benefits you get choosing this node with offensive options but earth is a prime example of "Only want Steamer Attention".
[2022-12-28 16:28:35] <@%donavanshepard> lets just drop this before it scales into something big

[2022-12-28 16:29:02] <earthsdefect> @vivald build is tanky as fuck, because it focuses on life, armour, but clear feels bad because of lack of damage. with decent investment and I'm sure at higher levels it might feel better but ealry maps feels bad

[2022-12-28 16:34:24] <lexats> I did T16s, eater, searing, with this build, with 100c gear, didnt die once, idk man

[2022-12-28 16:45:11] <+VicVega1810> is there a bug with scarabs? i spec metamorph, use scarabs every map, only 1 in 5ish has metamorph monsters. respec to legion, use legion scarab, only 1 in 5ish maps has legion. whats going wrong? i do not have the atlas passive for random outcomes
[2022-12-28 16:45:11] <SingleAutumnLeaf> What do you think of RF for sanctum? since it doesnt matter how much life you have cause its all about not reaching 0 resolve or inspiration Also thanks for a very detailed PoE, im kinda new to PoE and it really helps a lot
[2022-12-28 16:45:12] <DUCKL1F3> just tuned in. What is that sceptre? im guessing you cleared prefixes and left it as is? why craft such a low inc. damage?

[2022-12-28 16:46:45] <Vastorik> have you only ever played RF? have you enjoyed any other types of builds?
[2022-12-28 16:46:49] <Karantesh> if it is not consued you have stream on conscusness on
[2022-12-28 16:46:54] <%Motarkus> question is if the scarab is consumed or not
[2022-12-28 16:47:07] <Ninjakens> if you have Stream of Consciousness the map won't load your scarabs
[2022-12-28 16:47:09] <+VicVega1810> scarab is consumed.

[2022-12-28 16:48:45] <shado712> the trapper phase was fun
[2022-12-28 16:48:45] <jok7063> I came from minion builds. Once you go RF you can't go back as they say. Im a perma RF now
[2022-12-28 16:48:47] <Ninjakens> also the fire trapper guy
[2022-12-28 16:48:50] <Ninjakens> :)
[2022-12-28 16:48:54] <@%lemoncoolers> I love automated flasks so the "gain x charges when hit" really only works on armor builds so that restricts me to the left side of the tree except pathfinder.
[2022-12-28 16:49:02] <%+GraveyardBrawl> I got hooked during the trapper guy and stayed for the streamer.
[2022-12-28 16:49:03] <@%donavanshepard> wow

[2022-12-28 18:49:25] <RueTobas1> You dont need to sustain it, your ES recharge starts instantly
[2022-12-28 18:49:27] <tade33> it just regens naturally

[2022-12-28 18:49:45] <%Elewem> spending ES with EB doesn't count as it being damaged

[2022-12-28 18:57:10] <@%lemoncoolers> @typinghazard call to arms has nothing to do with 2 warcries. It makes warcries instant. If you find enduring cry indispensable then use it. It's kind of redundant on jugg because you're always max endurance charges.

[2022-12-28 20:16:49] <%Antiswipe> @Pohx you were running toxic sewer as your main map in trade?
[2022-12-28 20:17:07] <%Antiswipe> Dope - thanks
[2022-12-28 20:17:22] <heinz_franz> just get a mageblood and take every elemental flask
[2022-12-28 20:17:35] <+Etainz> There's no way to set up molten shell cast on move on something other than left click is there?
[2022-12-28 20:17:55] <adolebitque> Not dying to mirage ( KEKW ), but it was a good example, just came to my mind since I was facetanking T16 Esh and he surprisingly enough managed to kill me and I wondered if Lightning damage just has such high max hits that you need just super high layers to tank it if you ever try
[2022-12-28 20:18:30] <rejjAU> @Etainz that's a great way to have it not available when you really need it -- it'll be on cooldown and a huge hit will come in
[2022-12-28 20:18:32] <%+SpidercowSD> @Pohx Does the Rolling Magma start work for SSF or no? Having to check your lvling vod to see what you did
[2022-12-28 20:18:35] <heinz_franz> i use moltenshell on move and vall molten shell self cast, i also selfcast curse so you dont need hextouch

[2022-12-28 20:19:09] <heinz_franz> vall moltenshell with increased duration, its like 18 s 10k shield
[2022-12-28 20:19:30] <Viruzlolz> @pohx I know it isnt as good but how would you approach Elementalist RF differently in terms of gear?
[2022-12-28 20:19:34] <%+jeeze9> which is the better fracture base for end game wep. +1 or dot?
[2022-12-28 20:20:02] <+Etainz> @rejjAU I figured that's what vaal MS is for

[2022-12-28 20:20:36] <+Etainz> Holding down left click is just hard on my hand, but I don't see a way around it in options. Oh well

[2022-12-28 20:21:09] <rezalis_> @Etainz You could put move only on a keybind and use that
[2022-12-28 20:21:12] <@%lemoncoolers> @Etainz you can bind move to a different button
[2022-12-28 20:21:17] <heinz_franz> i move around with leftklick so i auto cast moltenshell every 5 s
[2022-12-28 20:21:28] <thorggrim83> @Etainz  shield charge for movement only in maps. really saves ur hand. Old mans tip
[2022-12-28 20:21:41] <kamikazecarrot> For Elementalist i recomend blockbased with UulNetol shield for 250hp on block
[2022-12-28 20:21:45] <+DoubleMeatTreat> bruhhh
[2022-12-28 20:21:48] <TheBDPlayer> its time
[2022-12-28 20:21:57] <+Etainz> yeah I've got move only on another button, just can't do molten shell as well like you can with left click
[2022-12-28 20:21:58] <+DoubleMeatTreat> is that 4/11?

[2022-12-28 20:34:36] <%+Nexflamma> im sure youve answered this a lot, but is there a better impossible escape for us than lethe shade?

[2022-12-28 20:35:23] <heinz_franz> i pick unstopble and drop the aoe ascendeny, so you are stun and frezze immune and schock immune from tempest shield

[2022-12-28 20:35:33] <adolebitque> Also, life regen can help you in only some of the situations you face, sometimes you need to value mitigation to even avoid dying to the hits
[2022-12-28 20:35:43] <TheBDPlayer> pohx, the ring from the no hit challenge run could work with rf?

[2022-12-28 20:36:34] <AeroFantasia> Not so much of an RF question as it is a PoE question in general. But it kinda seems like heavily investing in maps right now isn't as good as speed clearing them. I've been doing Harvest Sextants and Expedition but it seems to just barely pull ahead. Is there better end game content for me to be focusing on instead?

[2022-12-28 20:39:19] <+Etainz> @Etainz Right, but it's not a whole lot right? Like with 5k life and 250 ES I think it's something like 200 life regen. The other stuff you'd also get on a "normal" build and no one runs it there right? Or am I missing something or mathing wrong (totally possible)
[2022-12-28 20:39:20] <AeroFantasia> Thank you! I'm still relevantly new to the game and trying to dive deeper into it! This is my second season playing and I'm already 700 hours in.

[2022-12-28 20:49:27] <+tmountain13> is bleed different than corrupted blood? is that why we still take ralakesh despite taking the immune to corrupted blood node on passive tree?
[2022-12-28 20:49:43] <@%donavanshepard> they have different names, so i think they are different
[2022-12-28 20:49:50] <+DodderingOldMan> I fell like the most benefit I'd get from a PoB review is just being told which gear items would be most efficient and effective to upgrade next

[2022-12-28 20:52:19] <@%donavanshepard> its definitely been the easiest build to get into PoE over
[2022-12-28 20:52:26] <@%donavanshepard> but that might just be because you spent so much time on newer players
[2022-12-28 20:52:27] <+MadLeds> RF is good to actually learn the game. I played Seismic in previous leagues and it was such a stutter-step shitshow i didn't even pay attention to mechanics
[2022-12-28 20:52:32] <+MadLeds> with RF i can actually see them lol

[2022-12-28 20:53:28] <laganima> your walk through on how you do certain things was the best i have seen
[2022-12-28 20:53:44] <@%donavanshepard> yeah now that I understand that build and what makes it tick, starting to do some more end game stuff
[2022-12-28 20:53:44] <%+Saint_Of_Pain> would be sweet if you mentioned how many respec points were needed between each POB stage.
[2022-12-28 20:53:45] <+THEMIGHTYTEK> @laganima IMHO crafting is rough only because there isnt deterministic ways to get crafts you want.
[2022-12-28 20:53:45] <+MadLeds> your build is also great for SSF, so many other builds I tried and it was painful. They tell you "SSF viable" but you need to grind hard
