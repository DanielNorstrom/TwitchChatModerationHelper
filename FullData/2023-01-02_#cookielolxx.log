[2023-01-02 20:26:21] <s7aviotor> the reason I think adc is so tough is that you are heavy dependant on your support and junglers , especially if you dont have the mechanics to 1v2 during lane.

[2023-01-02 21:06:01] <ogtinderswindler> Where do I farm as adc when my midlaner refuses/cant sidelane in midgame?

[2023-01-02 21:06:09] <%+darky_the_fallen> Difference between bronze and gold is basically in their decision making skills, that's all
[2023-01-02 21:06:13] <myrlxx> how big is the difference between a challenger player and a pro like rekkles or guma?
[2023-01-02 21:06:14] <madworldro> who know that the silver now are the old gold players ?? since they make the iron devision

[2023-01-02 21:15:33] <%klngragn4r> only on lane
[2023-01-02 21:15:33] <%bestbikerush> no

[2023-01-02 21:15:41] <%Faramir1993> PrawlrClaw is better on cait

[2023-01-02 21:15:48] <%bestbikerush> not ap
[2023-01-02 21:15:48] <%9tailz_> technically yes, but realistically no his engage dmg is melee range
[2023-01-02 21:15:48] <%Jorojq27> bro Kenen is like range of lilia , not really RANGE
[2023-01-02 21:15:48] <%+lilspooklol> @TheOnlyKudo if its your job then yes, also itemize for them
[2023-01-02 21:15:48] <+getschwiftyinhere> xD
[2023-01-02 21:15:50] <%+awareholatres> technically urgot is ranged
[2023-01-02 21:15:50] <777raw777> was that cait a pro

[2023-01-02 21:15:54] <%klngragn4r> after laning he will just flash proto into 5 and ult
[2023-01-02 21:15:54] <%+Averus2> you dont need extra range to hit her, is that what you mean?
[2023-01-02 21:15:56] <skyboy2389> All in type champ
[2023-01-02 21:15:56] <+thesagesword> Ult and flank reliant
[2023-01-02 21:15:56] <+BarelyBasket> kennen has to headbutt enemy team to use his abilitys. W - E - R
[2023-01-02 21:15:57] <+Juanmorecombor> maybe there is reason why adcs above you build it
[2023-01-02 21:15:57] <goodboymattyp> The only thing ranged is Q, Kennon will be dashing IN fights
[2023-01-02 21:16:00] <%BabyNevi> kennen is engager lol
[2023-01-02 21:16:04] <+thesagesword> I would say no
[2023-01-02 21:16:04] <ogtinderswindler> Where do I farm as adc when my midlaner refuses/cant sidelane in midgame?
