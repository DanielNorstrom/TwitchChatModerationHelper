[2022-12-20 15:08:02] <!%TurtleArmyJess> hi Kim
[2022-12-20 15:08:05] <%+ecstasy_in_service> when you cast rot, when it hits them it dmgs them but the tics after do not count for waking up
[2022-12-20 15:08:08] <thecyberhorst> I think its bc the dragon breath counts as a hit, a rot tick may not
[2022-12-20 15:08:09] <+Neekk_Oh> try rot/sleep or sleep/rot
[2022-12-20 15:08:11] <%Ugedas> F
[2022-12-20 15:08:12] <%+nemo_76> casting rot will wake them but the damage over time will not wake them
[2022-12-20 15:08:12] <%meinMestar> oh i assumed rot damage also wakes them up
[2022-12-20 15:08:13] <Maniac_Engineer> depends on the order. the breath itself will wake but the tick of the proc will not

The string then walks back into the bar and orders a drink, bartender looks and says “hey aren’t you that string I just threw out?”  String says “ No , I am a frayed knot!”. yep. good one ascended

[2022-12-20 16:42:20] <%dennybur> yeah getting to altus activates it

[2022-12-20 16:42:42] <+s41nttr1n4> touching latest plateau site of grace is what starts the festival @dinossindgeil
[2022-12-20 16:42:46] <%Dooglie> I dont see you getting it off in time, but GL lul
[2022-12-20 16:42:47] <lilgreekness> ur very smart
[2022-12-20 16:42:49] <YaFOOOOOOOOOL> By default the castle is not in the "radahn" phase. Once you progress to a point, radahn phase is active. once you beat him, the castle reverts
[2022-12-20 16:42:49] <+s41nttr1n4> altus*
[2022-12-20 16:42:53] <lilgreekness> i have 99
[2022-12-20 16:42:56] <guyinaring> he is also very weak to rott
[2022-12-20 16:42:57] <lilgreekness> Im smort
[2022-12-20 16:42:58] <%RyuunosukeUdon> yes u can but it heals him Kappa (joking)
[2022-12-20 16:42:59] <%tommyf091> he is massevily vulnerable to rot
[2022-12-20 16:43:04] <AzaZ_ow> that's how melenia beat him so yeah
[2022-12-20 16:43:06] <%Jhingelnatz> I thoiught you cant rot him because he alrady has the rot? @dinossindgeil
[2022-12-20 16:43:18] <%MrNinja1234> being able to fight Radahn happens if you touch Altus Plateau or continuing Ranni's quest. before that, the arena you walked through would have the misbegotten and knight
[2022-12-20 16:43:20] <%pvaia> rot him and run around mikkaaFire
[2022-12-20 16:43:22] <xxsavinaxx> yes for real

[2022-12-20 17:03:07] <%dennybur> its called IMPASSABLE bridge, not easily walked across bridge
[2022-12-20 17:03:13] <%meinMestar> yep
[2022-12-20 17:03:13] <%+rogerdandy> i think if you go to altus first the duo won't be there

[2022-12-20 17:03:27] <%Captain_tro11s> You need to go from right side
[2022-12-20 17:03:28] <%+Datimda> you can definitely do it after Radahn, Bri did too
[2022-12-20 17:03:28] <Maniac_Engineer> I've done it this order before. it should show up
[2022-12-20 17:03:33] <crookie2cookie> What boss fight again?
[2022-12-20 17:03:36] <%aredmongoose> you can fight after you beat Radahn

[2022-12-20 17:43:29] <%remiri> @NevresTV i think 2x gargoyles will be the hardest fight in this run

You'll find a room that is guarded by four Rats, and ahead, is a doorway that is blocked by a white fog. To dispel this, you will need to use a Stonesword Key on the Imp Statue. You'll find a stock room upon unlocking the doorway, the room has a treasure chest where the book is.
