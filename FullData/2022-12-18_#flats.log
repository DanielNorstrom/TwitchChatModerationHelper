[2022-12-18 23:51:35] <+WarK1tty> @icenerdy if keeping them alive is the problem then tell them to use natural cover like corners and if you wanna really make sure they can make a ton of mistakes, someone with heavier healing?

[2022-12-18 23:52:20] <ne0n_black> honestly don't play support with them. Play tank or DPS and don't bail them out of bad decisions so they face consequences for their bad positioning
