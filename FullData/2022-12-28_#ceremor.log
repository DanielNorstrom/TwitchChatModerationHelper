[2022-12-28 00:19:35] <Turd_Stretcher> Slugs should be best. Buckshot isn't even comparable to em
[2022-12-28 00:19:55] <peerolius> why not btw?

[2022-12-28 00:20:52] <+bub1026> it's very situational @turd_stretcher . at close range I would prefer to be shot at with a slug cause there is a small chance they miss.  if you miss with buck shot at close range you are really bad lol
[2022-12-28 00:21:04] <peerolius> this is the best place i've been told by chat
[2022-12-28 00:21:06] <beeiy_98> is it dark all the time?
[2022-12-28 00:21:09] <Turd_Stretcher> If there were subsonic ammo to use along with the suppressors
[2022-12-28 00:21:22] <%bigc4_25> they are actually about as realistic as it can get for a video game
[2022-12-28 00:21:46] <beeiy_98> i swear it’s dark in my screen
[2022-12-28 00:21:48] <peerolius> its day time for u.not for me
[2022-12-28 00:21:56] <machinebunz> Yeah I like that suppressors make a good amount of noise
[2022-12-28 00:21:57] <widetribruh> oh yeah there was definitely a deer around there, its quiet now
[2022-12-28 00:22:06] <beeiy_98> there’s no sun
[2022-12-28 00:22:07] <Rapsterblue> I find the only suppressors that work are the original guns like scorpion
[2022-12-28 00:22:11] <Turd_Stretcher> @bub1026 You'd rather be shot with a slug than buckshot?

[2022-12-28 00:22:25] <FishboneCC> @Turd_Stretcher the vss round is subsonic im pretty sure and if ur far enough away the enemy wont even hear the bullet skeet

[2022-12-28 01:15:47] <%im_Pinkk> For as fucked as an inventory as you get the suit should 100% be more tank
[2022-12-28 01:15:47] <%xGeneralPAYNEx> Or add jetpack
[2022-12-28 01:15:48] <%zargki> if its stronger i want it to be limited spawn
[2022-12-28 01:15:50] <imbakedbee> more storage would make it all worth
[2022-12-28 01:15:58] <+RyanBoulanger> just needs a armour buff
[2022-12-28 01:16:04] <%skip_tracer_> jet. pack.

[2022-12-28 01:17:03] <%+toppa35> @whatheflax i dont think he tried to take him on, i think the guy that had the knife knew he would get fukked up by the other guy so he just straight up stabed him
[2022-12-28 01:17:06] <%zargki> dont they also only go uncon from the grenade launcher
[2022-12-28 01:17:15] <%im_Pinkk> You should get infinite stam, plus can vault max heights no matter what

[2022-12-28 01:17:35] <@%DyNaMiCNZ> Can someone explain this suit please is this a new lantia thing ?

[2022-12-28 01:17:51] <+RyanBoulanger> supposedly it got buffed recently but still needs work

[2022-12-28 01:19:05] <skip_tracer_> shock resist is the same as the lantia plate
[2022-12-28 01:19:06] <%im_Pinkk> I’d say giving it thermal and leaving the protection alone would be decent

[2022-12-28 01:19:10] <+RyanBoulanger> my thinking is - the devs want everyone to try the suit via quest and combat
[2022-12-28 01:19:12] <%zargki> we need to test that

[2022-12-28 01:23:13] <+70kg_d> getting the suit is such a tedious process i don't consider it fun at all
[2022-12-28 01:23:20] <%zargki> @spandy thats great and then you have unkillable 5 mans in suits
[2022-12-28 01:23:22] <%riverswrath27> I like you on the come up anyway…..
[2022-12-28 01:23:26] <%+only1canol1> @spandy yes
[2022-12-28 01:23:32] <%im_Pinkk> I still think that in lantia should be the cure for frostbite
[2022-12-28 01:23:39] <%+curlybob43> my DayZ 2023 wishlist: be able to boil rice
[2022-12-28 01:23:57] <LegitRandoNGL> don't think getting it's any fun regardless of how good it was
[2022-12-28 01:23:59] <%+spandy> i mean i'd be so down to join with everyone else in a server to hunt a group of 5 chads
[2022-12-28 01:24:01] <%zargki> nah i dont like that shit
[2022-12-28 01:24:09] <%+only1canol1> @curlybob43 that would be neat
[2022-12-28 01:24:11] <mosin_compensator> Yeah but the suit looks cool…
[2022-12-28 01:24:11] <+70kg_d> @im_pinkk maybe suit cures frostbite, that'll make it worth it Kappa
[2022-12-28 01:24:12] <%zargki> if they are limited spawn or smth then fine whatever

[2022-12-28 01:25:18] <+kipzilla> I wouldn't
[2022-12-28 01:25:23] <%im_Pinkk> Or you should get a MW2 style air strike kill streak on anywhere on the map.
[2022-12-28 01:25:30] <%+only1canol1> @zargki a limit would be good, maybe 2 or 3 completed suits only? and if you gather everything afterwards you get a completed Gauss instead?
[2022-12-28 01:25:44] <%+spandy> exactly
[2022-12-28 01:25:53] <%zargki> have you been playing these past weeks? LUL

[2022-12-28 01:26:12] <+70kg_d> don't they get oneshot by grenade launcher still
[2022-12-28 01:26:19] <mosin_compensator> Eventually you WILL die with the suit on. Even if it is actually OP
[2022-12-28 01:26:34] <%Panlenka> lax ran into a suit guy at the crack house lol
[2022-12-28 01:26:36] <%+spandy> i've never even seen one while playing lol
[2022-12-28 01:26:41] <%xGeneralPAYNEx> I’ve yet to get a suit
[2022-12-28 01:26:42] <%zargki> maybe wrong server? idk i ran into 4 suits just this past week
[2022-12-28 01:26:43] <@%DyNaMiCNZ> Might have to get on and give it a go
[2022-12-28 01:26:56] <%im_Pinkk> The suit sucks, people who say it’s op have never had it and aren’t good at the game

[2022-12-28 01:33:16] <flengoo> !legacy
[2022-12-28 01:33:16] <@%^Nightbot> The legacy gunplay mod replicates the weapon mechanics that DayZ used prior to the new player controller. Heavier weapons have more inertia when swinging to aim. Hipfire is no longer a laser beam when firing full auto. ADSing is slightly slower. Recoil is more impactful.

[2022-12-28 03:23:09] <BillySundown> there needs to be incentive to have players spread out and not meat grinder themselves into metro scenarios

[2022-12-28 03:29:40] <+HandyRandy93> Why did the stupid scope glint become the norm of games with snipers in them, so dumb

[2022-12-28 03:30:02] <@%+Chaosshield> you can remove your scope glint if you use a non 4x scope
[2022-12-28 03:30:08] <%zTDK> @jeffmanunited  me too but it's a good thing tho stops cheaters from invading the playtests

[2022-12-28 03:30:37] <JeffManUnited> @zTDK yeah, thats true!
[2022-12-28 03:30:45] <@%+Chaosshield> there's a 3.5x scope you unlock that's perfect
[2022-12-28 03:30:49] <@%+Chaosshield> no glint and great zoom

[2022-12-28 21:49:05] <+evera974> its the worst map for sure but you still can get 60-70 fps steady with a good computer , not sure if you can keep 80-100 fps tho
[2022-12-28 21:49:05] <+BloodSeeker8> i have been playing and constantly rubberbanding can barley move for some reason
[2022-12-28 21:49:13] <RotoLegrand> So, normally in a game you would like to disable shadows, filtering to the lowest and not using dsll
[2022-12-28 21:49:20] <%Theoleander> @ceremor your specs probably land you in the top 10%

[2022-12-28 22:57:46] <%ExistentialBrew> @ExistentialBrew No real difference gameplay wise. USEC is English, BEAR is not. Bear has better drip options for clothes.  Bear can also look more like scavs sometimes.
