[2022-12-30 00:33:45] <+hypxrbeam> I think its more to fund the game, but I do agree that now the game is progressively getting bigger and cant really be considered (early beta)
[2022-12-30 00:33:45] <conner1001> not having EoD is just you wanting to suffer more than everyone else
[2022-12-30 00:33:47] <+Light_Persona> they fucked alot of shit up too though Reserve is effed for one
[2022-12-30 00:33:47] <%bastrupkekw> if u wanna compete and have a good But to put things in, you need eod :D
[2022-12-30 00:33:48] <@+dasMEHDI> NGL though its hard to complain about a game that's already given 3 years of content, hard to say that about a lot of titles now a days
[2022-12-30 00:33:49] <+Briguydahood> @ballsyblasian but like all their updates, severely broken and poorly thoguht out
[2022-12-30 00:33:49] <aplasticbagforahelmet> eft will be the same rinse and repeat for years
[2022-12-30 00:33:51] <ZizzUrppOG> havent bought eod

[2022-12-30 01:06:41] <+Fadaar> tbh would have been better off without summits description, you were aimed at the corner which is what i interpreted. maybe the guy moved.
[2022-12-30 01:06:48] <+pineappled1ck> @denisds24 To be fair, summit said "Walk along the wall, you'll see him"
[2022-12-30 01:06:51] <%EnergeticIguana> Is Curtis joining you guys?
[2022-12-30 01:06:51] <+pineappled1ck> so i mean
[2022-12-30 01:06:53] <TheScowl> Shoulda coulda woulda, anyways...
[2022-12-30 01:06:56] <%$Jukes905> He's not blaming Summit he just said he gave no coms on where he was or where the guy who killed him was- which he didnt "he's laying down on the other side of the gate thing"
[2022-12-30 01:06:56] <+DiMEMM0> on the bright side you just made that guys day buy donating your loot to him
[2022-12-30 01:06:59] <CrowFlies00> yeah, he could have said laying in the open right at the entrance of the gate... not laying on the ground along the wall lol
[2022-12-30 01:06:59] <+wheeziie> RIP cock. You was such a massive cock too. You was going to make someone very happy. But it won't be Hutch tonight.
[2022-12-30 01:07:04] <tomc1k> omg summit didn't even shoot at this guy
[2022-12-30 01:07:05] <%JDmaelstrom> I was curious what happened to your nade

[2022-12-30 06:12:26] <Krustles> I don't think it was a boss name
[2022-12-30 06:12:29] <Dulius6> No, It was Ofibneofb aoefba @HutchMF
[2022-12-30 06:12:36] <Dulius6> It was not a normal guard name
[2022-12-30 06:12:53] <ShaddyDaShadow> Scav that killed him was named offiersky not zavodskoy like reshalas guards
[2022-12-30 06:12:54] <MoJanglesTV> Zavodsky I believe is scav Boss name
[2022-12-30 06:12:57] <%MXIPOV> Pretty sure they removed the Reshala spawn at stronghold when the goons came last wipe? I could be wrong but i could've sworn i read something about that.
[2022-12-30 06:13:11] <Dulius6> Thanks for streaming today btw
[2022-12-30 06:13:14] <ShaddyDaShadow> reshala doesnt spawn there anymore either since the goons got added

[2022-12-30 16:55:57] <ikky_0> the Depp case was a perfect case that proves why u dont believe everything u see @HutchMF
[2022-12-30 16:55:58] <%$ZSnakeDocZ> hutch has been arrested on suspicion of having no nipples. clearly he has no nipples
