He comes equipped with a very powerful height adjusting lever that’s perfect for our favorite streamer. LHChair doesn’t interact much so it’s really helps when chat can make their own content

[2023-01-02 23:09:18] <@^Nightbot> My favorite streamer is LHChair. he is very dark, has great lumbar support, and honestly he carries the stream when Cloudy is gone. He comes equipped with a very powerful height adjusting lever that’s perfect for our favorite streamer. LHChair doesn’t interact much so it’s really helps when chat can make their own content
