[2023-01-01 09:18:48] <%+hntd187> I mean there is no excuse for it being total trash and shit, but there are so many conflating things in optimization. The consoles in all fairness  have all the same hardware so it's much easier to understand  the performance profile on them.

[2023-01-01 09:23:18] <%+DrBovice> its the same reason they keep all the 3DS titles from being ported so even thought the game came out 10 years ago they can still charge ful; proce

[2023-01-01 09:24:31] <wozzezz> skyward sword is a game that I loved but never had the desire to replay because playing was exhausting
[2023-01-01 09:24:57] <%+hntd187> well because the wii has terrible hardware

[2023-01-01 09:25:29] <norvokplays> Metroid Dread had the direction of the 2D series main director but it was largely developed by Mercury Steam, who also made the Metroid 2 remake on 3DS
[2023-01-01 09:25:35] <ThatAccountBlaBlaBla> Yeah, I just checked, it was made mainly by an external team, I remembered bc that team is spanish and it surprised me

[2023-01-01 09:27:56] <capsaicinJT> thats just how nintendo's devs are organized, they are technically separate but they are basically nintendo exclusive devs
[2023-01-01 09:28:11] <snowshoveler22> I agree.  I feel like the Mario galaxy games would’ve been better without the wii mote.

[2023-01-01 09:29:37] <%+DrBovice> they showed that clip of mountains with the elder scroll 6 trailer like 7 years ago if not longer

[2023-01-01 09:31:32] <+m0nad0girl> Nintendo said the quality was bad so they restarted development at Retro Studios (prime Trilogy developers)
[2023-01-01 09:31:37] <+FirstNameBasis_> Metal gear or metla gear solid?

[2023-01-01 09:51:11] <%garryarganis> its short because it lacks puzzles, both RE3R and OG speedrunning wise are 40-45 minute games glitchless
[2023-01-01 09:51:15] <capsaicinJT> the biggest thing for me with RE3R is they screwed up nemmy really bad. he should have been like mr.x on steroids. you shoudl constantly be nervous he is stalking you. he should ambush you. he should feel smarter than you. instead he is super scripted and just runs at you, it's ultra lame

[2023-01-01 09:58:53] <%FrostWolf531> it's almost 11am here though and i'm not hangover despite having some drinks yesterday
[2023-01-01 09:58:59] <%MinstrelPangolin> maybe someday it'll happen--it does sound like a good idea a lot of fans would like maxyyShrug but that's up to Capcom, and clearly they keep their plate full as is
[2023-01-01 09:59:14] <%garryarganis> i want CVX remake so bad :(
[2023-01-01 09:59:27] <%FrostWolf531> @garryarganis maxyyParty
[2023-01-01 09:59:31] <1pitekk1> @capsaicinjt Ok its hard but still they can make remake on the remaster rules, better graphics, almost same gameplay
[2023-01-01 09:59:43] <%FrostWolf531> @garryarganis CVX is a remaster, CV is the original tbh
[2023-01-01 10:00:03] VIEWERS: 1 043
[2023-01-01 10:00:10] <Vexicrypt> You cant just remake Code Veronica in more realistic setting like last remakes because original is a clown fiesta
[2023-01-01 10:00:13] <Alpha_24> No 531 this time
[2023-01-01 10:00:13] <1pitekk1> besides they mostly like get a good base story then fk it up
[2023-01-01 10:00:17] <sieggy> ain't gonna happen lol, they'll cut 1/3 content from re4 like re3
[2023-01-01 10:00:20] <%garryarganis> @FrostWolf531 i know :)
[2023-01-01 10:00:47] <%MinstrelPangolin> we keep playing their games for a reason teenIDK
[2023-01-01 10:00:48] <capsaicinJT> compare capcom to koanmi or square enix and it's night and day lol
[2023-01-01 10:00:49] <+resonmon> yo maxy my man !!! Happy new years
[2023-01-01 10:01:00] <TheWrongSmokey> i wonder if code veronica remake wont happen cause she calls alfred a cross dressing freak
[2023-01-01 10:01:01] <%FrostWolf531> @Vexicrypt imagine doing the remake of that game, that's already pretty long, has actual 2 locations in it, that would be pain and a big budget for capcom
[2023-01-01 10:01:04] <1pitekk1> @sieggy thats the worst Thing, never ever preorder re games KEKW
[2023-01-01 10:01:36] <%FrostWolf531> yeah that would make sense but i dont think they want to invest so much
[2023-01-01 10:01:43] <Vexicrypt> Same for Dino Crisis
[2023-01-01 10:01:45] <+Carn_fu> yeah doesn't have mainstream attention
[2023-01-01 10:01:55] <+resonmon> I would like to see Resident Evil 0 remake not gonna lie
[2023-01-01 10:02:05] VIEWERS: 1 043
[2023-01-01 10:02:09] <%$Cyberdyne_T_800> Not even those who actually played CVX, like it at all ... LUL
[2023-01-01 10:02:19] <%+Marrickfait> I fear that if they announced a CVX remake, people would think it's a side-game
[2023-01-01 10:02:22] <%+Dattykins> ngl, code veronica looks kinda boring
[2023-01-01 10:02:22] <recline187> how would you advertise it to get people to try code veronica?
[2023-01-01 10:02:25] <+GrateMan> It's so looooong
[2023-01-01 10:02:28] <%FrostWolf531> @resonmon 0 is a remake on its own wdym its a exclusive prequel to the 1 remake
[2023-01-01 10:02:32] <Vexicrypt> @resonmon all they need to do is add a damn item box
[2023-01-01 10:02:35] <%FrostWolf531> @resonmon and doesnt have an original LUL
[2023-01-01 10:02:43] <NnyThulhu> people who played Code Veronica are the ones that played it when it first released because at the time it was the newest Resident Evil
[2023-01-01 10:02:45] <capsaicinJT> there is also a contingent of RE fans who don't like code veronica because they judge it very harshly for its weakest parts
[2023-01-01 10:02:49] <%+Marrickfait> Advertise it as a sequel to Claire's story from RE2R lol
[2023-01-01 10:02:50] <MeisterSH> did that game start as a dreamcast exclusive?
[2023-01-01 10:03:10] <capsaicinJT> MeisterSH yes, i still have my dreamcast copy
[2023-01-01 10:03:13] <1pitekk1> I dont like re 0 because of item management on the ground. without that is preety nice title
[2023-01-01 10:03:28] <wintergrimoire> welp time to single handedly fund REcodeV
[2023-01-01 10:03:37] <+omegaprospect> RE4R is a insane amount of money waiting
[2023-01-01 10:03:39] <%+Marrickfait> I wouldn't be surprised if RE1 got a remake, again, before CVX lol
[2023-01-01 10:03:39] <%FrostWolf531> despite zero was meant to be released for N64 there was even alpha some sort of, but they scrapped it because of hardware limitations
[2023-01-01 10:03:42] <%MinstrelPangolin> yeah, 4 trounces CV immediately out of the gate
[2023-01-01 10:03:46] <+resonmon> @frostwolf531 Prequel=remake in your eye ?
[2023-01-01 10:03:50] <Vexicrypt> Yeah but after RE4R whats next?
[2023-01-01 10:04:00] <%FrostWolf531> @resonmon story prequel lol
[2023-01-01 10:04:05] VIEWERS: 1 078
[2023-01-01 10:04:08] <Aktsuji> Speaking of CV i remember my parents renting a Dreamcast when it came out just to play it wetLUL
[2023-01-01 10:04:08] <+Remersion> 4 is probably the cut off point for remakes, right? No shot they remake re5
[2023-01-01 10:04:08] <TheWrongSmokey> code veronica is one of the few re games that if you dont know what youre doing you can brick the playthrough by forgetting puzzle pieces like the fire extinguisher
[2023-01-01 10:04:12] <+resonmon> @vexicrypt DMC1 remake xd
[2023-01-01 10:04:14] <1pitekk1> @vexicrypt re 9 then some bad remakes
[2023-01-01 10:04:15] <%FrostWolf531> @resonmon and yes 0 only has a remake and doesnt have an original game
[2023-01-01 10:04:35] <capsaicinJT> i gotta say tho, i was an early adopter of the dreamcast, and code veronica was SO poggers when it first came out
[2023-01-01 10:04:36] <%FrostWolf531> 5 doesnt need a remake
[2023-01-01 10:04:52] <%$Cyberdyne_T_800> At the end of the day, games are not a fan service, but a business. So why should they take a risk? And put money in a CVX remake? Like why?? It makes zero sense
[2023-01-01 10:04:52] <recline187> hmm ive only got ps2 as my oldest system, i couldn't even try it?
[2023-01-01 10:04:57] <%+Marrickfait> Did you see that some Silent Hill Demo was trademarked or something in Taiwan?
[2023-01-01 10:05:07] <+Carn_fu> what about doing another 1 remake
[2023-01-01 10:05:07] <ph_43> re4 doesn't really feel like it needs a remake to me
[2023-01-01 10:05:09] <%FrostWolf531> i want new games or remasters not remakes KEKW
[2023-01-01 10:05:12] <%FrostWolf531> KEKWHD
[2023-01-01 10:05:15] <Evertonb04> Are the Revelations games any good?
[2023-01-01 10:05:15] <+resonmon> they will remake 0. Mark my words
[2023-01-01 10:05:16] <ph_43> what would they change
[2023-01-01 10:05:18] <%+Marrickfait> RE5 they would totally change everything lol
[2023-01-01 10:05:22] <+GrateMan> I mean 4 is where all of the action combat took off, you'd need to toll around with that before you tackle 5 or 6
[2023-01-01 10:05:32] <1pitekk1> dont Think they would Focus on main title because they cutting lot of coupons from r3makes
[2023-01-01 10:05:34] <Aktsuji> i just want Parasite Eve 1 and 2 ported to PC somehow Sadge
[2023-01-01 10:05:41] <pasmandoo> Im still sad because of RE3 remake..
[2023-01-01 10:05:47] <%+frozenchops> theyll remake 5 for money
[2023-01-01 10:05:56] <oyf8> gaiden remake
[2023-01-01 10:06:00] <Alpha_24> New games

[2023-01-01 10:06:06] <%+Marrickfait> I disliked village so I'd take a CVX instead LOL
[2023-01-01 10:06:14] <%Irrelativity> I would take both. Remakes and new games balanced
[2023-01-01 10:06:15] <+Parahmansa> I would like a CV remake but thats just because I havent played it before :P
[2023-01-01 10:06:16] <gigantar3> what would the plot be for revelations 3?
[2023-01-01 10:06:22] <recline187> why not both?
[2023-01-01 10:06:22] <Aktsuji> honestly they should just bite the bullet and remake Dead Aim that will make everyone happy wetPIKA
[2023-01-01 10:06:26] <%FrostWolf531> outbreak would really need a reboot game cuz these remakes would make no sense when coming to them
[2023-01-01 10:06:34] <capsaicinJT> capcom wants a new RE every year, the remakes let them do a lower effort game every other year
[2023-01-01 10:06:39] <balkonas1> All I want is continuation of Alex story :(
[2023-01-01 10:06:42] <1pitekk1> and thats not only capcom doing that, look at TLOU. Remaster p1. P2. Another remaster of the remaster
[2023-01-01 10:06:44] <lokilasher_> I want new games, the remakes should stop at 4. But money talks, so idk what Capcom will do.
[2023-01-01 10:06:57] <%FrostWolf531> Pog dead aim remake
[2023-01-01 10:07:05] <%FrostWolf531> discount leon with discount ada Kreygasm
[2023-01-01 10:07:09] <+GrateMan> I demand a Gaiden remake!

[2023-01-01 10:07:21] <totallynotnux> they tried making re3 remake along with re2make and it ended up a mess

[2023-01-01 10:08:36] <Aktsuji> i feel like RE3 Remake was a test of can a non Main team do just as well and unfortunately it fell short which kinda sucks for the team that did it because it was more of a Your damned if you do and Damned if you dont

[2023-01-01 11:06:44] <xAshtanx> I remember a long time ago playing siege, someone on my team was named Maxylobes and when asked if it was you, they claimed to be but would never speak to prove it
[2023-01-01 11:07:06] <justshmeano> @coldstare180 Thanks :)

[2023-01-01 11:38:21] <DriverBen> I still remember the review for Doom Eternal. One guy couldn't get passed a simple puzzle early on in the game that was meant as a tutorial, so he gave it a bad rating. It was honestly pretty sad.
[2023-01-01 11:38:39] <unknownabysss> elden ring was so big that it got on google rewind
[2023-01-01 11:38:54] <+Ghouldude> I think OOT any% is the bane of speedruns. The amount of people that hate speedruns because they saw a wrong warp run in OOT that I've talked to has to be over 10.
[2023-01-01 11:39:03] <qcinos> I just becoming corny because people trying to enjoy the game and his first view Watchers and trying to look at the game and you're going fast through it like it's okay but like it's really no point going fast like enjoy the game and find new Secrets find new things about the game instead of just running through it again nobody want to just run through the game all the time it seems boring I guess the whole Lobby is going to hate me

[2023-01-01 11:42:21] <Goonzie99> the only thing im good at speedrunning is tacos.
[2023-01-01 11:42:39] <!Failmore> cause re2r was easy to follow and basically no glitches

[2023-01-01 11:42:54] <unknownabysss> the pegasus glitch was dope
[2023-01-01 11:43:10] <!Failmore> i think it still works

[2023-01-01 11:45:09] <+Ghouldude> If RE4R doesn't flop it will definitely be huge.
[2023-01-01 11:45:12] <!Failmore> it depends how scripted re4r is, or does it just drop you in like re2r
[2023-01-01 11:45:21] <Muikula> The thing that pushed me away from starting Village was looking at the mess of rules
[2023-01-01 11:45:34] <+Ghouldude> It could still be panned by reviews.
[2023-01-01 11:45:42] <OnlyTees> I hope they dont put in another bad ashley sequence
[2023-01-01 11:45:57] <!Failmore> village had big issues with its timer

[2023-01-01 11:46:28] <!Failmore> there was no other option on console, had to be deathless

[2023-01-01 11:47:17] <Muikula> Not necessarily specific rules, but it seemed like a bit too much for me to start setting everything up just to run the game
[2023-01-01 11:47:17] <!Failmore> yeah and the timer was so dumb forced deathless
[2023-01-01 11:47:46] <!Failmore> yeah re2r is just a better intro game

[2023-01-01 11:48:38] <!Failmore> im expecting re4r to be a heavily scripted mess with tons of DA nonsense and a terrible timer
[2023-01-01 11:49:04] <+Ghouldude> I thought the VR thing was for 8
[2023-01-01 11:49:04] <!Failmore> there is some VR for it, but they wernt clear on what that was
[2023-01-01 11:49:35] <+IanTwoCents> What’s any% mean I see some streamer that are speedrunning have that in their title.
[2023-01-01 11:49:36] <+Ghouldude> Well, there will be a mod for FPP, I mean they did for 3R and 2R.
[2023-01-01 11:50:06] <+Ghouldude> It means they only complete the objectives necessary to roll credits @IanTwoCents

[2023-01-01 12:01:13] <+Ghouldude> I hope they'll hire someone that can guide their development, item density and combat feel are going to be important. And it will have to scale with the difficulty settings and not be ass.
[2023-01-01 12:02:05] <Muikula> Horror isn't something you can just throw together and call it a day tbh

[2023-01-01 12:13:35] <%FrostWolf531> callisto is not worth $70

[2023-01-01 12:13:57] <kei_77> Because our economy is poop
[2023-01-01 12:14:02] <+Ghouldude> I think Callisto suffers from it's combat, the atmosphere is good and item density is good. But melee combat is butt cheeks.
[2023-01-01 12:14:05] <DriverBen> I remember a time where the Canadian dollar was worth more, and people were going states side to buy cars because of it
[2023-01-01 12:14:06] <skarekr0wxx> Callisto is a crappier dead space...my opinion
[2023-01-01 12:14:09] <Frookie12> calisto is $89.95 in aus
[2023-01-01 12:14:15] <%FrostWolf531> how can you charge $70 for a game that barely works even on monster PC's and thats not even long.

[2023-01-01 12:33:57] <DriverBen> Charlie is very supportive of gaming. I think he's even done Smash tournaments with money out of his own pocket
[2023-01-01 12:34:09] <DriverBen> Before he started an org
[2023-01-01 12:34:22] <%peacefaker> hi maxy, hi chat! Happy New Year!

[2023-01-01 12:34:44] <dav_the_hat_man> @DriverBen Pretty sure he's admitted that the orgs are all technically losing money but he still keeps it going.
[2023-01-01 12:35:20] <DriverBen> @dav_the_hat_man i'm not surprised, he has a few teams he's already paying for, and only way to make money is winning tournaments.
[2023-01-01 12:35:46] <dav_the_hat_man> @DriverBen Outside of sponsors ofc
[2023-01-01 12:35:51] <DriverBen> and sponsorships too i guess

[2023-01-01 12:37:36] <Beastmister> The RPG where you can level up every item in endless dungeon crawls to lv100, which each take several dozen hours.
[2023-01-01 12:37:45] <@%H1pp0__> the amount of people in the amok voice channel, puttin crazy amount of hours into perfecting the rng launch and tearing the game apart is crazy

[2023-01-01 13:37:18] <DriverBen> @Maxylobes well some of the port glitches you've done. How do people think about using those in the first place

[2023-01-01 13:38:02] <XionBarzhad> Quick Saving is kind of a thing that exists in a lot of PC games. Lot of skips tend to involve it.
[2023-01-01 13:38:07] <NotToast> It makes you wonder how many glitches go unreported that could revolutionize the game

[2023-01-01 13:40:09] <Otoako> LUL very true, Bethesda engine is just entirely duct tape at this point

[2023-01-01 13:42:43] <Finvara> one of the bigger problems they would have switching engines. Modding goes out the window. and that's probably the biggest reason why Bethesda games sell so well. Mods

[2023-01-01 14:43:18] <lastinout> best performance for sure
[2023-01-01 14:43:44] <%Klarden> @doublequack yes. It's the Steam version of Goat Simulator 3. EGS got it's own version
[2023-01-01 14:43:54] <%RysiuQ> @Klarden or not having a permanent brainfart
[2023-01-01 14:44:10] <%+ChaseeHoward> That’s how you parked it lol you ran into the wall

[2023-01-01 14:44:34] <%noriken> damn that car is SOLID
[2023-01-01 14:44:34] <%Klarden> yeah, shockingly, it seems like they save the exact position of how you parked.

[2023-01-01 14:45:06] <%Klarden> I guess they reset near the gate to make space for the new car
[2023-01-01 14:45:20] <%noriken> did it lock you out from driving your other car
[2023-01-01 14:45:30] <%RysiuQ> yes @noriken

[2023-01-01 14:45:42] <%Klarden> but if you're not in that volume near the gate they save the exact coordinates (most gates would just despawn the old car, because it's more optimal -_-)

[2023-01-01 14:46:43] <%noriken> if only cars in GTA were this strong...
