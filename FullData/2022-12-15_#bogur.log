[2022-12-15 20:01:34] <%Bloodycrumpetsandtea> Remember the good times when you could stun hog out of ult
[2022-12-15 20:01:47] <%Bloodycrumpetsandtea> and he could not use his abilities when ulting?
[2022-12-15 20:01:50] <%ZTOWNZzz> wonder how strong ramattra will be with speed increase on nemesis form

[2022-12-15 20:03:52] <%XHXHXH_OW> Next thing they need to remove is the ult charge passive. Then the game will be pretty damn good.
[2022-12-15 20:04:07] <%XHXHXH_OW> The Ana buffs are good! Hopefully she’ll be meta
[2022-12-15 20:04:22] <%XHXHXH_OW> And flats may of convinced a dev to giving fire strike 100 damage back
