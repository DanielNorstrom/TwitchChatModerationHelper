[2023-01-02 16:22:24] <%CJS7070> Complex is a great way of putting it. I kinda miss how simple everything used to be and when you wanted to do something complicated you just figured it out instead of having it built into the game
[2023-01-02 16:22:28] <MaxNeedsSnacks> there's also gonna be a new questbook tab for processing lines

[2023-01-02 16:51:05] <MaxNeedsSnacks> i think the 48h also only starts counting when a recipe runs?
[2023-01-02 16:51:10] <$JPili> @zynithtv ebay?
[2023-01-02 16:51:14] <bluedeed> With tape you don’t need to pound with the tools either
[2023-01-02 16:51:17] <BBQgril> its gonna break at the least desiarable time KEKW

[2023-01-02 17:06:43] <Qbertman> couldnt you just do and import bus for the fluid?
[2023-01-02 17:06:45] <MaxNeedsSnacks> you can never have enough of a backlog
[2023-01-02 17:07:02] <%Venxuri> @Vapp3 have fun, craft more than you need for circuits, motors etc, dont burn out
[2023-01-02 17:07:03] <%+wonly> Is pati picking the pc up today?
[2023-01-02 17:07:13] <MaxNeedsSnacks> also your machines can just always keep running in the background
[2023-01-02 17:07:36] <%+tiberiom> that sounds like a problem for future waffle

[2023-01-02 17:12:27] <$jordan2185> Pati will have a new pc soon so it won’t matter
[2023-01-02 17:12:31] <headtr1ck> without level emitter you can place the interface directly on the machine

[2023-01-02 17:12:44] <InoUno> How do you increase the amount of items in the ME interface without having the items?
[2023-01-02 17:12:48] <kypudo> tell pati to install optifine
[2023-01-02 17:12:50] <Bulltank> @headtr1ck the machine wont extract and import if its directly on it. You'll still need item conduit
[2023-01-02 17:12:59] <Bulltank> @InoUno scroll mouse
[2023-01-02 17:13:01] <DaddyDiddy> Yeah but when you need it you’ll be able to create ruby dust from the millions of red stone you’ll have @giantwaffle
[2023-01-02 17:13:29] <%+TPells67> Agreed
[2023-01-02 17:13:36] <DaddyDiddy> Yeah you’ll need ruby dust eventually but not for at least another week or so of progression
[2023-01-02 17:13:44] <Flobu_> bulltank it seems thhats not the casede if waffel could look up some machines that pati fixed already
[2023-01-02 17:13:58] <InoUno> @Bulltank Hmm, I tried that, but doesn't work in my game.
[2023-01-02 17:14:01] <%$Venamah> then set a 1k limit to chrome and ruby, so its not running all the time?

[2023-01-02 18:29:54] <quantum__rainbow> Regrettably one of the biggest factors I have to take into account with headphones is do they fit over all the earrings. Its a curse and a blessing at once
[2023-01-02 18:29:56] <%Yash_88> Thats like me and work shoes i haven't bought the the same work shoes the last 3 times i needed new ones and they each lasted like 4-5 Years XD

[2023-01-02 18:53:29] <%+LiveType> VR is overall too expensive and extremely hard to accurately market. That's the primary reason VR adoption is so low. Like a good vr setup can be done but it costs ~!4k which is the issue.
[2023-01-02 18:53:41] <+Orin_The_Sly> Imagine Steam is a Mall, where you go to shop for your games

[2023-01-02 19:02:47] <%+Markus11982> i usually recommend ftb infinity evolved expert, but its 1.7.10
[2023-01-02 19:02:49] <+ArbitraryHubris> E2E is also not a good first modpack
[2023-01-02 19:02:50] <LANFrog> what would you say is the best Tech mod pack to get into for a brand new modpack player
[2023-01-02 19:02:55] <%DaddyDiddy> play something that's not expert mode

[2023-01-02 19:20:49] <kane1941> automate crafting crads?
[2023-01-02 19:20:54] <Chupun> keep in mind that crafting cards take a cpu slot when running and you can runn out of cpu fairly quickly if you use a lot
[2023-01-02 19:20:55] <CodeMonkeyV1> what is the item list on the bottom of JEI?
[2023-01-02 19:21:05] <Timiderxbox> Now it will create that when you do the recipe
[2023-01-02 19:21:06] <lukasalbert> need to point the interface into the machine right ?
[2023-01-02 19:21:15] <Timiderxbox> Why do you want to store it at all times?
[2023-01-02 19:21:17] <stefan150> @HappyPizzaLife it was taken as intended, he understood the joke, dont apologize if you havent done anything wrong :D
[2023-01-02 19:21:22] <%+Akiron_rafa> dont think you need to output the items it will place them when doing the recipe
[2023-01-02 19:21:29] <kitty_cat20> this will do it always
[2023-01-02 19:21:32] <$kbigLiar> I don't think you need the rods in there

[2023-01-02 19:21:46] <%+Akiron_rafa> the recipe knows
[2023-01-02 19:21:46] <%DaemonSzyman> just test it
[2023-01-02 19:21:48] <lukasalbert> pati did the finished thing in there
[2023-01-02 19:21:48] <kane1941> you are not outputting
[2023-01-02 19:21:51] <%+Corvous> you stock the endresult not the ingredients
[2023-01-02 19:21:52] <Timiderxbox> It needs to be the dust that you keep 64, so the output not input
[2023-01-02 19:21:53] <kypudo> u want the output not input
[2023-01-02 19:21:54] <lukasalbert> not the rods in your case
[2023-01-02 19:21:59] <kitty_cat20> this way it only does by requesting
[2023-01-02 19:22:02] <lukasalbert> its what i saw at least

[2023-01-02 19:22:43] <%+Corvous> i would set the storagebus to extract only
[2023-01-02 19:22:47] <+dennis3833> the things u put in the top is for "storage"
[2023-01-02 19:22:57] <+dennis3833> to keep in stock
[2023-01-02 19:22:59] <$kbigLiar> patty has a 2 piece thing - first, the patterns so the AE system can say to "Craft X". second, he stores a stack of ingredient + crafting card, so there is always a passive craft of a stack in the AE system
[2023-01-02 19:23:03] <%+LiveType> @n3wtpond @n3wtpond Nah. It was $140 from alibaba OMEGALUL . Got lucky and seller agreed to sell one at that price. Not great resolution but good enough for most things
[2023-01-02 19:23:06] <%0x4273> missing blitz
[2023-01-02 19:23:23] <kypudo> this is so overcomplicated XD
[2023-01-02 19:23:41] <lukasalbert> does waffle need to point the interface down ?
[2023-01-02 19:23:42] <+TheShaddo13> blitz is german for lightning
[2023-01-02 19:23:46] <Archie8300> is this new way less intensive to render?
[2023-01-02 19:23:50] <+dennis3833> and u cant autocraft with ur old system
[2023-01-02 19:23:50] <n3wtpond> Nice @livetype , that’s a hell of a deal. Wish mine was that cheap. Super cool even if it remotely does what it’s supposed to though
[2023-01-02 19:24:02] <%0x4273> mana dust not primal mana
[2023-01-02 19:24:05] <+LuciferSpirt> typed it in wrong
[2023-01-02 19:24:09] <highlandermccloud> @giantwaffle him storing the finished product in there with a storage bus on the back is a  weird way to do the storage emitter but you could just have it craft on command not make extra ?
[2023-01-02 19:24:18] <kitty_cat20> you can put upgrad on the interfaces for more space for the patterns
[2023-01-02 19:24:31] <lukasalbert> @Giantwaffle you can use expansion cards in the interfaces for the molecular assemblers so you can fill them with recepies
[2023-01-02 19:24:31] <kane1941> now try to craft 1 mil
[2023-01-02 19:24:38] <lukasalbert> it takes way less space but is slower

[2023-01-02 19:25:24] <+dennis3833> @lukasalbert depends on the type of recipes u put into
[2023-01-02 19:25:28] <%maccabeus> Bedge
[2023-01-02 19:25:40] <lukasalbert> yeah it usually does save a bit of space

[2023-01-02 19:25:54] <%+LiveType> @n3wtpond It's a brand new sensor crammed in a chinese product. Came out 4 months ago. The one I got is the tc001 that uses a smartphone for viewing. 50k pixels 256x192 25 fps. I was impressed as this used to cost >$1k just 5 years ago.

[2023-01-02 19:57:37] <%+Purecrew> Lower the priority?
[2023-01-02 19:57:39] <$ShadowBlade72> Priority issue because it was requesting all of it there?
[2023-01-02 19:57:39] <L0rd0fHeaven> try with different priority
[2023-01-02 19:57:41] <lukasalbert> configure it ?
[2023-01-02 19:57:45] <%CantTouchDisNow> maybe it was an item in the crafting queue and it waited for them to be crafted
[2023-01-02 19:57:46] <stormzwest> put the storage bus touching the interface processing the dust to read only mode

[2023-01-02 19:57:50] <@$SailorWS> cuz 7 8 9
[2023-01-02 19:57:56] <Timiderxbox> Put priority of interface you are looking at to 2
[2023-01-02 19:58:00] <+Foobaah> it has to make 100 first to fill up this, no?
[2023-01-02 19:58:02] <jdude20202> Set the ebf as higher priority
[2023-01-02 19:58:03] <%WERT_ASDF> if you make the smelter inferface higher priority?
[2023-01-02 19:58:05] <kane1941> all of it goes in that crafting interface until there is 100 dust
[2023-01-02 19:58:07] <kypudo> insert the ones you have in the me
[2023-01-02 19:58:08] <@%ninopanda> @SailorWS DUDE
[2023-01-02 19:58:09] <!%orangecreamsicle3> cuz you're holding the dust Pepega
[2023-01-02 19:58:11] <Timiderxbox> Or atleast higher than storage bus limited 100 stainless steel

[2023-01-02 19:58:14] <+RockyMountainHiThere> @SailorWS Nice one
[2023-01-02 19:58:17] <dylan0806> Does the io interface have an higher priority?
[2023-01-02 19:58:26] <%+TPells67> Is it supposed to be 2 on the circuit??
[2023-01-02 19:58:34] <@%ninopanda> @SailorWS how you doing mah dude
[2023-01-02 19:58:38] <$ShadowBlade72> Maybe it does priority by proximity? So the machine nearest gets it first.
[2023-01-02 19:58:45] <lukasalbert> if the interface is higher in prio it will take the dust yeah ?

[2023-01-02 19:59:32] <%TelRehiad> could also add a crafting card, no?
[2023-01-02 19:59:38] <%WERT_ASDF> other way would be to make the ones with storage bus with a lower priority
[2023-01-02 19:59:39] <@%ninopanda> I feel ya there. @SailorWS been on the grind irl as well
[2023-01-02 19:59:46] <kane1941> just add crafting card with ingot here
[2023-01-02 19:59:46] <$ShadowBlade72> Couldn't you also just set the terminals crafting them to -1 priority?
[2023-01-02 19:59:51] <lukasalbert> @Giantwaffle cant you lower the priority on the interface with the 100?
[2023-01-02 20:00:02] <stormzwest> making a lot of crafting cards will get laggy, really quick

[2023-01-02 20:00:32] <%Winstonrocks> crafting cards are more laggy than level emitters
[2023-01-02 20:00:32] <Sui_Ume> @ShadowBlade72 no, then it prioritises the me-system storage over the interface
[2023-01-02 20:00:34] <lukasalbert> lowering priority on the interface that stores the 100 should work i thinnk  less configs to think of

[2023-01-02 20:01:46] <@%ninopanda> to your doors are not 3 x 3.  you could use the screens to tell you what each area is
[2023-01-02 20:01:53] <jdude20202> probably can't lower the priority because it will fill the storage drives
[2023-01-02 20:02:03] <+jo_beorn> @Giantwaffle youre going to be infinitely making stainless steel if thats what you want
[2023-01-02 20:02:13] <%Nilau> Crafting cards can make the ME system super slow if you use them too much. The issue is that they simulate an entire craft to check if the ingredients are in the system. It's fine for small crafts but using it on entire machines is yikes

[2023-01-02 20:27:24] <%DaemonSzyman> @DaddyDiddy last i saw they were far, far ahead of waffle. Probably approaching the ending
[2023-01-02 20:27:41] <%Dagmoo> @daddydiddy the farthest group should be pretty close to done

[2023-01-02 20:27:48] <%DaddyDiddy> waffle its the red coal NBT issue you have to manually put the red coal you made into the recipe, you can't shift click from JEI @Giantwaffle
[2023-01-02 20:27:51] <%+Seerion> That crafting pattern needs to be in an interface next to a crafter
[2023-01-02 20:27:52] <weightmaker> if it cant autocraft your stacksize, it cant start request
[2023-01-02 20:27:54] <%+Seerion> not in that interface
[2023-01-02 20:28:13] <$ShadowBlade72> You were missing 4.
[2023-01-02 20:28:15] <+Koeckie> is it the wrong red coal?
[2023-01-02 20:28:22] <%DaddyDiddy> no its because red coal is player locked so you have to manually change the recipe
[2023-01-02 20:28:28] <%+daedmissica0> 2 per 9
[2023-01-02 20:28:28] <@%ninopanda> @DaemonSzyman i set it up for new years fireworks KEKW
[2023-01-02 20:28:35] <weightmaker> red coal has NBT data that breaks autocrafting.

[2023-01-02 20:28:39] <%DaddyDiddy> take out the red coal in your system and put it in the recipe
[2023-01-02 20:28:44] <%DaddyDiddy> its NBT problems
[2023-01-02 20:28:45] <lukasalbert> since it stores values with your gp

[2023-01-02 20:29:56] <%+Seerion> the crafting card is all you need in that interface to craft them
[2023-01-02 20:30:16] <%+daedmissica0> you have a card
[2023-01-02 20:30:18] <+Koeckie> does it really work in the same interface?
[2023-01-02 20:30:18] <%DaddyDiddy> i don't think crafting cards work with red coal

[2023-01-02 20:31:16] <weightmaker> its trying to start autocrafting 64 of them at a time and cant. It happens all the time on the sub server
[2023-01-02 20:31:29] <%gartoks> @Giantwaffle What you can do is make an interface that provides coal and conduit it into the resonator then extract the coal into a drawer. That coal can be used
[2023-01-02 20:31:37] <+stickman_02> @PureSpider I mean I just got here so tbf didnt know it was said that much haha
[2023-01-02 20:31:51] <PureSpider> NODDERS
[2023-01-02 20:31:53] <$kbigLiar> it might've waited until it could craft the full stack before requesting it?
[2023-01-02 20:31:53] <Kuma_Taru> @stickman_02 Still worth
[2023-01-02 20:31:55] <%DaddyDiddy> i would recommend making like 4 or 5 more resonators for coal crafting just to keep up @Giantwaffle
[2023-01-02 20:31:56] <Zero_Dragon> it must be waiting till you have a certain amount of stuff to do it
[2023-01-02 20:32:09] <AlinksPast> should leave that joke in last year, this year! NODDERS

[2023-01-02 21:13:46] <%DaemonSzyman> Oh nice
[2023-01-02 21:13:54] <lukasalbert> dont they like use diamonds per second then ?
[2023-01-02 21:13:59] <lukasalbert> instead of minutes
[2023-01-02 21:14:19] <Tapeman83> it uses a lot of diamonds, but it's not that hard to automate a lot of DMLs, and I ended up producing an excess of diamonds, which were useful later

[2023-01-02 21:15:33] <Tapeman83> I never used nuclearcraft for power. is it better in numi than omni? cause it wasn't used for power in omni @DaddyDiddy

[2023-01-02 22:20:28] <%+lvyEartman> a 4790k vs a 12700k is not that much faster thougf, the boost clockspeed is almost the same

[2023-01-02 22:21:41] <+Zyie> @lvyEartman Oh, but the difference is huge, can't just look at boost clock. Look at lists comparing the two, it's like a 50% improvement or something like that.

[2023-01-02 22:21:58] <Stormflare> physical limitations will force people to innovate and create more efficient computing rather than just more transistors

[2023-01-02 22:28:13] <$CeeDreamer> @purespider Ahhhh I’d have to slowly try it cause im a wimp with spicy
[2023-01-02 22:28:14] <Archie8300> if they didnt grate it in front of you and it disn't account for half the cost of the meal it ain't Wasabi
[2023-01-02 22:28:35] <%Dagmoo> yeah real wasabi is expensive af
[2023-01-02 22:28:35] <PureSpider> CeeDreamer imagine crunchy, a little spicy, a little tangy cabbage
[2023-01-02 22:28:50] <$CeeDreamer> @purespider That does sound good
[2023-01-02 22:28:52] <ruthlessrellik> Why don't they farm more wasabi?
[2023-01-02 22:29:03] <+Zyie> @Archie8300 Yeah, "wasabi" is almost never actually wasabi Sadge
[2023-01-02 22:29:21] <PureSpider> CeeDreamer and just LOADED with umami, which is my favorite part
[2023-01-02 22:29:35] <Sui_Ume> @Giantwaffle real wasabi is good for 20-30 minutes after grating, that's why you can't buy it as a paste
[2023-01-02 22:29:35] <RefiixGaming> Wokege yet again
[2023-01-02 22:29:42] <Archie8300> @ruthlessrellik They can't industrialise it so the quantities made are small

[2023-01-02 22:31:26] <%Nilau> @Giantwaffle I think your inventory ME crafting still has a frame saved
[2023-01-02 22:31:35] <%+LiveType> @xDeadBringerx This is the answer. It's essentially active transistor count * active duty cycle* frequency = net performance. There's a little more to it but that's the gist of it.

[2023-01-02 22:54:12] <+suicidebolt> It sucks for IT automation and backend stuff for companies
[2023-01-02 22:54:14] <%0x4273> why would you want that
[2023-01-02 22:54:14] <%+LiveType> I'm on win 10 due to zen 3 ftpm issues with win 11
[2023-01-02 22:54:15] <%banshay3> like arguing with the crackhead in front of the 7eleven
[2023-01-02 22:54:20] <owl_guardian> have everything else ready to settup that ebf
[2023-01-02 22:54:20] <Smileynator> I don't want to go into ADVANCED SETTINGS to switch my bluetooth headset from WORK pc to HOME PC and vice versa daily.
[2023-01-02 22:54:23] <%maccabeus> that sounded like a mac-user argument to me Susge

[2023-01-02 22:54:26] <Dylo321> @Giantwaffle what does pati have
[2023-01-02 22:54:31] <thepolaroidbear> 11 has issues. 10 does not.
[2023-01-02 22:54:34] <%OrangeW2> because it offers nothing I want
[2023-01-02 22:54:37] <Francisco_Scaramanga> Need all new hardware
[2023-01-02 22:54:39] <+suicidebolt> Also on that Bluetooth connections problem is on 10 also
[2023-01-02 22:54:39] <le_Pure> bcuz i cant OMEGALUL
[2023-01-02 22:54:39] <zzzDai> Because 11 is a worse OS then 10
[2023-01-02 22:54:40] <calebhub514> I'll probably switch to W11 whenever a game I want to play actually had DirectStorage support tbh
[2023-01-02 22:54:41] <HostileLogOut> win 10 has a crap ton of issues lol
[2023-01-02 22:54:44] <Skorpio1> you have to use 11 for the 13th gen intels
[2023-01-02 22:54:44] <%maccabeus> because not switching takes zero effort
[2023-01-02 22:54:44] <Dodara87> no it's not
[2023-01-02 22:54:44] <%ImposterArchitect> 10 has plenty of issues

[2023-01-02 22:54:46] <%+saini311088> im still xp
[2023-01-02 22:54:48] <%Narcotical> Microsft thinks my computer can't run 11 therefore they won't allow me to upgrade lol
[2023-01-02 22:54:49] <+Manacaym> maybe the PC can't go to 11?
[2023-01-02 22:54:49] <zzzDai> I use both, and 11 is worse is many ways.

[2023-01-02 22:56:33] <%+lvyEartman> Windows 8 with the application screen was really bad

[2023-01-02 22:57:09] <+ModestGlottis> electronics dont look as complicated inside anymore its all just one tiny chip, not much to see
[2023-01-02 22:57:13] <%$PaulFlies> haha. same with Gameboy original LUL
[2023-01-02 22:57:13] <$LittleAddictions> can you 3D print transparent stuff?

[2023-01-02 22:57:17] <%+Etwas77> i had a clear gameboy it was great
[2023-01-02 22:57:20] <Discoverer123> getting a gameboy SP that had the backlight was huge
[2023-01-02 22:57:22] <%Narcotical> I had one of those enlarging and lighting things you put ona gameboy color KEKW
[2023-01-02 22:57:27] <MrDaveje> That light really didnt work that well

[2023-01-02 22:57:45] <%$PaulFlies> @Narcotical same, with actual bulbs, not LEDS LUL
