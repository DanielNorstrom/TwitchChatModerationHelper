[2023-01-05 09:57:59] <%MoistHeinous> imagine healing people by yelling at them
[2023-01-05 09:58:07] <squigbiz> engineer has a healer build
[2023-01-05 09:58:08] <+Co0O0okies> mechanist can be a really good healer
[2023-01-05 09:58:12] <+Ancaron> You shout at people to "shake it off" and they actually do Pog
[2023-01-05 09:58:16] <TheresADesign> even necros can heal with blood magic

[2023-01-05 09:58:48] <%MoistHeinous> necros are fun in pvp. I've only played at launch
[2023-01-05 09:58:54] <%MatthewScammell> "YOU DON'T HAVE CRABS KANTO" Did that healing work? KEKW
[2023-01-05 09:59:20] <Obxidian_> Also, tanking depends on the boss mechanic more than the class
[2023-01-05 09:59:45] <+FlushmasterCyclonis> Firebrand (guardian), druid (ranger), tempest (elementalist) and scrapper/mechanist (engineer) are the most common and generally effective healer supports, though I'm aware of a vindicator (revenant) heal support build that isn't particularly popular that I've been meaning to try out
[2023-01-05 09:59:49] <Snowwraith> They released each of this missions like a month apart.

[2023-01-05 10:29:57] <+FlushmasterCyclonis> The standard fantast aesthetic and human female meta fashions often include light to moderate shininess but there's a certain point at which it becomes blinding supernova. Specifically when you can no longer easily discren what the actual character looks like under all the bright glowy effects

[2023-01-05 12:36:11] <Snowwraith> @1cpop Attacks generally hit up to 5 targets, so melee just hits anything near you (and makes sure to include your selected target if there's more than 5).

[2023-01-05 12:40:50] <Snowwraith> ARR does clearly suffer from being made in like 18 months whilst still patching the original 14 for many of them.
[2023-01-05 12:40:57] <+imbrai> What is AAR?

[2023-01-05 12:41:41] <OleDegrum> or like duty finder
[2023-01-05 12:41:42] <OleDegrum> LMAO
[2023-01-05 12:42:04] <1cpop> Mostly dungeons, I find dungeons mechanics were the group has to act as a team is neato. Absolutely whaling on a boss is nice but gets boring after a while
[2023-01-05 12:42:09] <+gamerteddybear_> @OleDegrum naw like if i que up and get a level 20 dungeon, i get all my abilities are not usable
[2023-01-05 12:42:13] <1cpop> *where, whoops
[2023-01-05 12:42:17] <OleDegrum> Yeah dungeons are boring anyways
[2023-01-05 12:42:17] <@%MiyaMewrilee> Buy boosts AND buy Ultimates! (This is a joke btw don't buy kills you won't look cool my dude)
[2023-01-05 12:42:20] <skythius> the problem with FFXIV now is it's become min max
[2023-01-05 12:42:38] <+gamerteddybear_> @skythius thats every mmo all the time
[2023-01-05 12:42:40] <OleDegrum> @skythius every game is min max tho..
[2023-01-05 12:42:45] <%nemafow> I like poking things with a stick
[2023-01-05 12:42:46] <Snowwraith> They have stripped out a lot of earlier abilities so they could more later.
[2023-01-05 12:42:54] <Snowwraith> So it gets weirder as times goes on.
[2023-01-05 12:43:03] <Snowwraith> *could add more
[2023-01-05 12:43:12] <OleDegrum> If u dislike the leveling stuff (Which I agree on) I would recommending buying a boost
[2023-01-05 12:43:16] <OleDegrum> I played thru the story tho
[2023-01-05 12:43:17] <skythius> oh I know it's never about the adventure anymore

[2023-01-05 12:43:37] <OleDegrum> @skythius I mean, people who mostly does MSQ just cares abt adventure

[2023-01-05 12:44:25] <Snowwraith> It's more they buffed dungeons rather than nerfed Fates at least.
[2023-01-05 12:44:27] <@%+defaulthumike> ayo chat, check out this boomer over here
[2023-01-05 12:44:29] <Ketrah> Boomer? Who is calling me?

[2023-01-05 12:44:48] <skythius> @OleDegrum thats true
[2023-01-05 12:44:49] <Snowwraith> And they want to keep the dungeon population up so people needing clears for the story can get parties.
[2023-01-05 12:44:55] <1cpop> Is Fates meant to be like world events?
[2023-01-05 12:44:59] <%nemafow> I imagine Aiyanya sitting at her PC desk, walking cane just off to the side NODDERS
[2023-01-05 12:45:16] <+gamerteddybear_> @1cpop yeah fates are events out in the world.

[2023-01-05 12:45:31] <Snowwraith> @1cpop Basically, yeah, just what the game calls them, they're pretty generic though compared to something like GW2

[2023-01-05 12:45:44] <OleDegrum> @1cpop  FATEs (Full Active Time Events) are dynamic scenarios, often battles, that appear around the world
[2023-01-05 12:45:45] <thechi420> bawk
[2023-01-05 12:45:51] <1cpop> I see, yeah I never see anyone else doing them but maybe that's cause I'm in the low level regions
[2023-01-05 12:46:47] <+gamerteddybear_> Deep dungeons are very good for leveling
[2023-01-05 12:46:51] <Snowwraith> Also expansion classes don't start at 1.
[2023-01-05 12:46:58] <Snowwraith> So they skip that entirely.

[2023-01-05 12:47:55] <1cpop> I heard that GW doesn't have established roles like Tanks and Healers, how does dungeons work? Is everyone DPS essentially?
[2023-01-05 12:48:25] <Snowwraith> @1cpop You can spec yourself out to support, but everyone's designed to be self-sufficient.
[2023-01-05 12:48:52] <Snowwraith> Some endgame stuff like raids bosses target the highest toughness person so you can "tank".
[2023-01-05 12:49:08] <@%MiyaMewrilee> Wolf goes right for the wolf
[2023-01-05 12:49:08] <+gamerteddybear_> @1cpop they do and dont, the least established are tanks, but they have support and healers and all classes are expected to do some dps
[2023-01-05 12:49:23] <1cpop> Huh... I see

[2023-01-05 12:53:47] <Snowwraith> GW2 doesn't really do "dungeons" anymore but its replacement its done since are "Strike Missions" which act more like an instanced public event chain.
[2023-01-05 12:53:48] <Ketrah> Braham is not very liked BUT I hate Caithe 100x more
[2023-01-05 12:54:43] <Snowwraith> The story here combines the two, so these are Missions with Main Story.

[2023-01-05 18:07:14] <@%Dark_Fable> Fun fact about Xenogears (first Xeno game). It was originally pitched to Square to be FF7, then as a Chrono Trigger game, before been made its own thing..well 80% made
