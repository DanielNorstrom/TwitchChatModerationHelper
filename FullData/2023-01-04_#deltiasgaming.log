[2023-01-04 17:57:43] <%+AnabolaSWE> what are the other dudes doinbg when you call out the symbols?  @Deltiasgaming
[2023-01-04 17:58:26] <!%WardenBSG> Top symbol - Tells you where an enemy is you need to kill. When you kill it it spawns the second symbol.
[2023-01-04 17:58:31] <%+AnabolaSWE> oh the rooms has the symbols on them
[2023-01-04 17:58:39] <!%WardenBSG> Second symbol - Tells you what room to go into.
[2023-01-04 17:58:42] <%NebTex_> That looks awesome
[2023-01-04 17:58:44] <%+pat_awesome> pretty much, 3 guys locate the correct room, then collect the right symbol again. do that 3 times, then find one of the 3 pillars with all 3 symbols
[2023-01-04 17:58:48] <+infamousglory89> Some D2 action huh? nice which raid is this?

[2023-01-04 17:58:49] <+Echo2Omega> First is left or right side. Second is one of the rooms, third is left or right inside the room. The runner then gets one of 3 symbols that is on one of the three pillars.

[2023-01-04 17:59:29] <+BuzztheBartender> For that little extra I suggest either weak and clear or monochromatic for an extra 10% damage for arc abilities and arc weapon damage
[2023-01-04 17:59:46] <%+AnabolaSWE> Is hunter harder or are all classes equally "hard"?

[2023-01-04 18:01:43] <@%ur_Shulgi> @AnabolaSWE Yep, all 3 classes have different movement / jump abilities.  That is a great way to help decide which class you really like
[2023-01-04 18:02:05] <%questyking> @AnabolaSWE hunter have a double jump, warlock a shitty glide and titan a better double glide

[2023-01-04 18:02:49] <!%WardenBSG> Titans have the best jump.
[2023-01-04 18:03:01] <%+PlagueSD> I find warlock jump easiest... I have more control over where I land.
[2023-01-04 18:03:02] <+Echo2Omega> Every class brings something to the table. Titans bring the crayons.

[2023-01-04 18:28:33] <TheMiddlemansOpinion> Regular content = soft cap, powerfuls for first hard cap, pinnacles to get to the hardest cap, in light power/level. Seasonal levels artificially boost light. Light = Attack power + resistance in leveled content.

[2023-01-04 18:45:49] <%+PlagueSD> @kraniel94 support is only 1 of 4 (soon to be 5 subclasses) you'll be fine as a void or arc warlock.
[2023-01-04 18:46:19] <%coconutmigrates> You can also use Assassin's Cowl on solar hunter with a knife spam build. Super good.

As a kid, my sister had a parakeet named Sprite (His feathers matched the colors of a sprite can) When I got my parakeet, I named him Pepsi (His feathers were all white). Pepsi at one point had a soda called Crystal Pepsi which was clear.

[2023-01-04 20:06:29] <!%WardenBSG> @coconutmigrates Mostly just doing story beats and whatever I feel like. Trying to keep myself from burning out, so if I stop enjoying myself I go play something else. Its been working

[2023-01-04 20:16:33] <!%WardenBSG> @herd173 Like I said, its a personal choice. For me a weapon should make me think of where it came from. My armor is where I get creative. I don't even like seeing shaders on other peoples weapons. Feels wrong to me.
