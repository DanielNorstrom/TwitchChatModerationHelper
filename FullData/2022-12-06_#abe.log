[2022-12-06 21:01:08] <am_andrew> what does iskall mean by the exploit ?
[2022-12-06 21:01:23] <+waikitakore> Whhat's the exploit?
[2022-12-06 21:01:24] <%celinabena> the way you can make the minimap larger for a moment
[2022-12-06 21:01:26] <+waikitakore> I don't see it
[2022-12-06 21:01:40] <%+kyanshiba> i thoguht that was built in LOL

[2022-12-06 21:01:55] <%celinabena> iskal you should check out how deadpine's looks when he's in a vault. it's insane- he can see multiple rooms
[2022-12-06 21:02:26] <SirPoopsolotl> they already nerf minimap mobs before KEKW gonna remove it soon

[2022-12-06 21:03:11] <notAgnus> hi abe and chat
[2022-12-06 21:03:12] <%raspberrykelly> i dont really see how it's an exploit it only shows you the next room if you're already halfway there

[2022-12-06 21:03:22] <zensway> I don't think its that big of an exploit, you could just resize your map to be that big in general if you wanted
[2022-12-06 21:03:54] <zensway> might as well just get rid of the minimap altogether in the vault at that point imo
[2022-12-06 21:04:10] <%celinabena> I don't think abe is exploiting it but I think you can zoom way out of the minimap in the overworld and when they go in a vault, the enlarging of the minimap can then show multiple rooms
[2022-12-06 21:04:28] VIEWERS: 548
[2022-12-06 21:04:41] <zensway> Abes only really shows 1.25 rooms
[2022-12-06 21:04:48] <Filsklor> yeah lot of people do it
[2022-12-06 21:04:52] <Filsklor> i do
[2022-12-06 21:04:57] <%celinabena> I love the feature. I can keep my minimap small and not taking much space on the screen and can enlarge when I need it
[2022-12-06 21:05:03] <%Maiionaise> I do it too
[2022-12-06 21:05:26] <zensway> exactly
[2022-12-06 21:05:41] <%celinabena> especially because I play on a smaller laptop screen. not enough space for everything sometimes
[2022-12-06 21:05:45] <%Blibop> he's probably joking
[2022-12-06 21:05:52] <%Blibop> rigth?
[2022-12-06 21:06:09] <RaaOne11> man i just really like how you are so cool about it, not being salty.
[2022-12-06 21:06:11] <%PaneHS> that axe feels so good
[2022-12-06 21:06:24] <%Blibop> what would be the advantage tho?

[2022-12-06 21:06:35] <zensway> good point abe
[2022-12-06 21:06:36] <vendyMS> @Blibop no... they are try to fix it
[2022-12-06 21:06:45] <JoeFoxe> the point is so we lock it to a size that you can view the minimap at a designated size the whole time. so you only can view the room you are in
[2022-12-06 21:06:52] <clearpeeinthelemonadepool> only an exploit if it's not intended and helpful
[2022-12-06 21:07:24] <%Blibop> @Abe unbind it

[2022-12-06 21:07:56] <Bfreed10> you should probably just entirely remove the key

[2022-12-06 23:46:14] <@%AnonymousJ143> baboHi
[2022-12-06 23:46:15] <%KiiWiiiii> vaults should be harder... not enough people dying tbh
[2022-12-06 23:46:27] <spac3wha1e> yea was just boutta say
[2022-12-06 23:47:05] VIEWERS: 890
[2022-12-06 23:47:30] <mightyvee707> disagree, they're hard enough
[2022-12-06 23:47:30] <%heeman_msi> rubidium is a life saver
[2022-12-06 23:47:35] <its_honk> Hbom dies often enough
[2022-12-06 23:47:44] <Mr_Un> I mean abe's gear is literally all extra HP + armor and such. If they did even more that would be insane for people who aren't as geared
[2022-12-06 23:47:49] <@%zvr1> @KiiWiiiii it's still in early game
[2022-12-06 23:47:51] <Foxinthegames> why cant i pick anythink up in my inventory like im shift clicking everythink? does anyone know how to turn it off?
[2022-12-06 23:47:55] <CaptIChaos> normal player die plenty pro gamers are just too good
[2022-12-06 23:47:55] <mightyvee707> it's not fun if this becomes dark souls
[2022-12-06 23:47:56] <%+sarcastic_minion> tell that fromsoft and elden ring Sadge
[2022-12-06 23:48:08] <%+SenpaiSyndy> pete is the only one in "mid game" which isnt in the game yet
[2022-12-06 23:48:11] <Mr_Un> Also we haven't seen higher levels with new mob types/themes and higher tier mobs
[2022-12-06 23:48:13] <%+Honeth> Foxinthegames open a chest on the right side there should be yellow arros left of them is a button called shift lock disable it
[2022-12-06 23:48:16] <zorcon1990> your and petes gear is a little op aswell most others are struggling or playing very safe

[2022-12-06 23:48:55] <Foxinthegames> @Honeth  thank you good chater lol
[2022-12-06 23:48:55] <%KiiWiiiii> @KiiWiiiii early game is harder than mid game tbh, after leveling heal up a bit and having some fear skills its really easy
[2022-12-06 23:48:58] <zedzed__> but also if you die you kinda lose everything it's a little infuriating losing all your crafted gear and whatnot
[2022-12-06 23:48:58] <CaptIChaos> majority of deaths are normally skill issues

[2022-12-06 23:49:14] <+SolosWorldStreams> not every game that is hard should be dark souls level hard to be fun
[2022-12-06 23:49:16] <YerFriendGraph> folks shouldn't have to be OP full time streamers to enjoy this pack tho

[2022-12-06 23:49:45] <%KiiWiiiii> maybe abe just makes it look too easy
[2022-12-06 23:49:49] <+DrowningPenguin> Agreed, also making a game so pro-gamers find it hard means it‚Äôs impossible for casual gamers like myself.
