[2022-12-21 16:37:59] <%chuckbuckb0buck> HCR is the M13 of LMGs

[2022-12-21 16:38:02] <jugs4> only thing is hcr recoil pattern is weird

While it certainly has a chocolate flavor and cocoa powder as a main ingredient, a red velvet cake is not a chocolate cake. It has far less cocoa powder in it than a traditional chocolate cake recipe."

[2022-12-21 20:38:05] <clubartillery> Is meta a big thing in this game or is it more balanced?
[2022-12-21 20:38:05] <%+tritttycent> got a feeling. getting the Nuke this match!!
[2022-12-21 20:38:12] <%itsz_drippy> that statement makes zero sense
[2022-12-21 20:38:23] <xtodak> havent been on a teepee stream in years
[2022-12-21 20:38:26] <xtodak> good to be ack
[2022-12-21 20:38:26] <+afromanthevideogame> @clubartillery just watch every streamer they all use the same cheesy shit
[2022-12-21 20:38:28] <xtodak> back
[2022-12-21 20:38:35] <%dabighutch> @clubartillery RPK feels a cut above, but other than that pretty balanced maybe
[2022-12-21 20:38:37] <+afromanthevideogame> it’s why viewership is at an all time low for cod
[2022-12-21 20:38:38] <%thegooseofzeus> @clubartillery There’s a clear one gun to use at least
[2022-12-21 20:38:39] <+afromanthevideogame> and playerbase
[2022-12-21 20:38:44] <brofratsodabro> its more balanced but there are still a few guns that are more widely used than others
[2022-12-21 20:38:44] <+afromanthevideogame> shit game
[2022-12-21 20:38:56] <Taffophile> the guns aren't the reason LUL @afromanthevideogame
[2022-12-21 20:38:58] <brofratsodabro> I think its much more balanced than it was for hte majority of WZ1
[2022-12-21 20:39:01] <%+B_Eezie_> @afromanthevideogame you seem like you'd be fun at parties
[2022-12-21 20:39:02] <+afromanthevideogame> l there is no balance @brofratsodabro
[2022-12-21 20:39:03] <notfelixdacat> your still watching KEKW
[2022-12-21 20:39:06] <%itsz_drippy> so viewership and playerbase are low because streamers use the same loadout? gotcha

[2022-12-21 23:26:00] <craftngraft> The correct spelling of plurals usually depends on what letter the singular noun ends in. 1 To make regular nouns plural, add –s to the end. 2 If the singular noun ends in –s, –ss, –sh, –ch, –x, or –z, add -es to the end to make it plural.
