[2022-12-11 13:46:46] <+Clamps_SH> The community in OSRS is the biggest thing holding that game back
[2022-12-11 13:46:46] <%Ch0c0l33thybrid> old school players just dont want the game to change because they hate rs3

[2022-12-11 15:40:50] <dreamwalkertunes> He doesn‚Äôt like the game he has a compulsion and doesn‚Äôt want to get another 200m
[2022-12-11 15:40:52] <%HOTPOT4T0> rs is life
[2022-12-11 15:40:53] <Pangaren09> that tweet feels like bait
[2022-12-11 15:40:57] <zippow> why flame at scott he is literally saying he wants to do the skill
[2022-12-11 15:41:01] <dreamwalkertunes> It‚Äôs pretty easy to understand
[2022-12-11 15:41:18] <stee1flex> gatekeeping change very cool
[2022-12-11 15:41:26] <%Medoliss> Its very rare to see players hating the fact that they will have to play the game again
[2022-12-11 15:41:27] <%+GroinShot> if they had a compulsion... they wouldnt be able to "boycott" the skill
[2022-12-11 15:41:31] <doloriferous> I only played semi-addictively EZ
[2022-12-11 15:41:55] <zippow> hes basically saying dont train it he wants to go up in ranks
[2022-12-11 15:41:58] <%+exodk_93> its just cold
[2022-12-11 15:42:02] <BigPsi> you would think they would be excited for a new skill as its a second chance to be higher up the ranking
[2022-12-11 15:42:02] <dreamwalkertunes> I disagree with his take but the lad obviously has ocd. I‚Äôm just callin it what it is.
