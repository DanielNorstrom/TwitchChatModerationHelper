[2023-01-08 10:55:22] <%+TrepieGGEZ> theyre not following you in?? monkaS
[2023-01-08 10:55:23] <%BartjuhOnFire> @trepieggez   Maybe.   I always do my scav runs there.  Never had any problems really
[2023-01-08 10:55:28] <%+cl4mpy> no beep boop anymore?
[2023-01-08 10:55:30] <%fredboi1> upstarirs
[2023-01-08 10:55:33] <%f0osterTV> i don't include suss/fishy deaths in that count
[2023-01-08 10:55:41] <%f0osterTV> only 100% cheats
[2023-01-08 10:55:53] <%Lemings> f0osterTV I mean, others might have been cheating too, just walling or something that you can't really tell because the game doesn't give you the tools
[2023-01-08 10:55:53] <%+TrepieGGEZ> @BartjuhOnFire me too but pmcs seem to be in there forever at the mo, interchange is my favourite place to scav
[2023-01-08 10:56:00] <%f0osterTV> indeed
[2023-01-08 10:56:18] <%Lemings> It's always there in the back of your mind
[2023-01-08 10:56:22] <+EL_Zacke> Yeah, one cheater can make you feel like other good players are just cheating, I do the same thing.
[2023-01-08 10:56:24] <%+TrepieGGEZ> it is a very frustrating feeling

[2023-01-08 10:56:44] <+EL_Zacke> honestly, its so bad in warzone 2 i just stepped away from that game, seems like its a problem in so many games now

[2023-01-08 10:56:47] <%BartjuhOnFire> @trepieggez  same.   Ah well.  Being killed on my scav doesn’t hurt. Just annoying
[2023-01-08 10:56:53] <%thisispreston> That's a big problem for cheating in this game imo. You don't really really have any way of confirming it's a cheater
[2023-01-08 10:57:02] <+AussieScro> Is there anyway to actually stop cheaters?

[2023-01-08 10:57:33] <@%$Daergar> It's always an arms race, the cheaters vs the devs
[2023-01-08 10:57:37] <+smuk42O> Needs to be punishable by law
[2023-01-08 10:57:40] <%Ogjohn> all anticheats are useless
[2023-01-08 10:57:44] <%WellyWonkaDonka> well its just a chasing game all the time
[2023-01-08 10:57:50] <%Lemings> Doesn't matter what anticheat it is, it depends on how well the devs implement it, which they usually don't. The people selling cheats make more money than the people implementing anti-cheat
[2023-01-08 10:57:52] <%BartjuhOnFire> Jail time for cheaters
[2023-01-08 10:57:52] <+dadNladz> battleeye is a disgrace, making a living doing the bare minimum
[2023-01-08 10:57:55] <%+Mr_Dorfmeister> There is a way to stop cheaters but using open engines like UNITY will make the problem very difficult
[2023-01-08 10:58:06] <%thisispreston> I saw cheaters in fucknig Fall Guys once, that's when I knew I'd seen it all lol
[2023-01-08 10:58:20] <%f0osterTV> @Mr_Dorfmeister that is completely irrelevant
[2023-01-08 10:58:55] <DJGamer1> people need to stop spending real money on in game items and the cheats will stop
[2023-01-08 10:58:58] <TheLoneeWolf> unfortunately as long as there is a game there will be people who cheats.
[2023-01-08 10:59:08] <%Lemings> DJGamer1 OMEGALUL as if that will ever happen
[2023-01-08 10:59:11] <%f0osterTV> @DJGamer1 some people cheat because they enjoy cheating
[2023-01-08 10:59:14] <+EL_Zacke> dam that dude chasing you

[2023-01-08 10:59:20] <@%$Daergar> @DJGamer1 Online cheating existed LONG before real money in-game items
[2023-01-08 10:59:29] <%Lemings> People also need to stop being complete assholes, probably has the same chance if not less
[2023-01-08 10:59:35] <%thisispreston> Yeah stopping selling for IRL money won't do anything
[2023-01-08 10:59:40] <%garypuk> biggest issue for this game is that the game wastes a lot of your time already with load times and that makes the time wasted by cheaters even worse
[2023-01-08 11:00:11] <+EL_Zacke> the problem with this game is it has a weird addiction that keeps you coming back
[2023-01-08 11:00:14] <TheLoneeWolf> No all people cheat for a profit. alot of them are people who dont wanna take the time to actually try to get good at the game
[2023-01-08 11:00:19] <TheLoneeWolf> not*
[2023-01-08 11:00:24] <%+TrepieGGEZ> if something in a game is even remotely grindy people will pay for someone else to get it for them, lazy stupid people...
[2023-01-08 11:00:28] <%thisispreston> Sac loves to complain more than anything though so it's a win really
[2023-01-08 11:00:57] <%f0osterTV> honestly i think you should avoid the cheating discussions @BreaK , not because it's not a problem but because it's going to perpetuate your negative emotions and probably it harder to enjoy the game
[2023-01-08 11:01:04] <%f0osterTV> the problem won't go away

[2023-01-08 11:01:21] <%Lemings> The only way to get rid of cheating is to play Singleplayer games NODDERS
[2023-01-08 11:01:22] <%WellyWonkaDonka> ye people just need to accpet it lolit is not going anywhere...
[2023-01-08 11:01:31] <+EL_Zacke> nah you right its been the same for like 4-5 years
[2023-01-08 11:01:47] <%Lemings> Why would they bother? People still play despite the cheatos
[2023-01-08 11:01:49] <%WellyWonkaDonka> They probably do they are just always chasing which is why all anti cheats are shit
[2023-01-08 11:01:54] <DJGamer1> @Daergar is it not an incentive to still so it?
[2023-01-08 11:02:00] <+EL_Zacke> the best time is after a new patch, youll encounter less cheaters, than after all the cheat suppliers update the cheat for the new game update then they are all back running again

[2023-01-08 11:02:39] <%f0osterTV> they pay battleeye to work on anticheat
[2023-01-08 11:02:50] <%f0osterTV> essentially
[2023-01-08 11:03:01] <%f0osterTV> that's their contribution
[2023-01-08 11:03:07] <@%$Daergar> Hell, at this point you could probably ask ChatGPT to develop a cheat for you
[2023-01-08 11:03:11] <%WellyWonkaDonka> it would have the same issues on any other anti cheat though

[2023-01-08 11:03:56] <%Lemings> TheLoneeWolf And the cheat devs have a much stronger financial incentive to create cheats than the devs working on the anti-cheat for whatever wage they get

[2023-01-08 11:44:06] <%poetandersonava> well Riot got into bet with FTX, so they're giga fucked from that. A lot of money just disappeared

[2023-01-08 11:54:01] <%+Deffan1> @BreaK Earlier u didnt see the player name as a scav but now you do so yeah why use a scav
[2023-01-08 11:54:06] <v44ld> some players have like over 30 ledx on flea with insane rep
[2023-01-08 11:54:13] <v44ld> not banned
[2023-01-08 11:54:15] <v44ld> nothing happens
[2023-01-08 11:54:15] <cybermyk> I've seen Blxnk spawn in move 20 Metres mag dump a guy then rubber band back to the spawn point and die showing no hits on the mag dump
[2023-01-08 11:54:30] <%poetandersonava> they could 100% use the flea market to detect cheaters

[2023-01-08 11:55:05] <%TrepieGGEZ> but how do they get that amount of rep when no one else has flea yet?

[2023-01-08 11:55:08] <Zeiyuri> Yes, but they wouldnt have 30 ledx' this early

[2023-01-08 11:55:16] <%TrepieGGEZ> like it was like that on day 2 of wipe, people with 40 gpus or whatever on flea
[2023-01-08 11:55:21] <%+HitmanTwoOne> all they need a data analyst looking at the flea data
[2023-01-08 11:55:32] <%SlimmrockTV> suppose I best see whst this coffee is like
[2023-01-08 11:55:34] <%poetandersonava> ok then, so use the flea to indicate which players you should be investigating at the very least

[2023-01-08 11:55:40] <%TrepieGGEZ> must be surely

[2023-01-08 11:56:13] <%Lemings> But if they get banned in 20 mintues, they won't be buying new accounts because they don't have the time to make RMT money
[2023-01-08 11:56:14] <%+HitmanTwoOne> no @BreaK its stolen credit cards, they will get charged back
[2023-01-08 11:56:20] <%Rastah_Mouse> Early wipe a lot of gpus etc are left from questers
[2023-01-08 11:56:22] <cybermyk> They buy stolen or hacked accounts
[2023-01-08 11:56:23] <%+PhisTiKated> they going to take an employee away from deving ...waste of time for them at this point
[2023-01-08 11:56:26] <%TrepieGGEZ> maybe they dont want to get rid of the cheaters because the game is easy without them susFrench Kappa

[2023-01-08 13:30:54] <@%rockshiv> But you always have to ensure that the forest is replanted if you clearcut, either by planting or seeding
[2023-01-08 13:30:59] <late_666> no reason to not replant, only way to make money really

[2023-01-08 14:27:08] <Kam_Sly> PUBG has mostly consistently improved over the years. There have been some strange choices, like the blue chip detector but for the most part I don’t think there is a lot wrong with the game. Most of the problem for me is that I don’t like some of the maps

[2023-01-08 14:27:42] <%+KiwiJimm> @Cartster I think PUBG has a lot smaller addressable player base and the nature of the game dictates some content choices I guess., So they are a bit more creatively constrained

[2023-01-08 14:28:17] <%thisispreston> @GlutenFreeVapes It's F2P though, people will just make new accounts to get in the "new" player lobbies

[2023-01-08 14:32:18] <%Lemings> DonerStoom Yeah same. But my problem is that you can never know if it was a cheater that killed you, or some random network issue or bug that someone might be abusing. I just dislike playing against other humans

[2023-01-08 14:37:16] <mrmelmann> Games are at their best when the community and the game are both yet to be refined and metas created. All games are usually at their best at the start.
[2023-01-08 14:37:17] <%Lemings> AsBeane Wasn't it H1Z1 BR? Arma was around but it was very small
[2023-01-08 14:37:25] <%+KiwiJimm> I am glad I missed DayZ... I would have lost my spare time to it had I known more about it :-)

[2023-01-08 14:37:50] <+Crowtein_> the fun hooneymoon period of a game is always great until sweaty bastards show up
[2023-01-08 14:38:04] <%Line_Noise> One of the joys of DayZ was the map was so big that you could always adapt strategies. There was always a way to withdraw unless you put yourself in the middle of a town
[2023-01-08 14:38:07] <%Lemings> People take games too seriously now, which just sucks all the fun out of them

[2023-01-08 14:38:43] <%+KiwiJimm> There hasnt been a BIG twitch hit for a while now. Like a proper one...
[2023-01-08 14:38:48] <%TrepieGGEZ> i think if you team up with peops who are taking it more / less seriously than you, someone is gonna have a bad time
[2023-01-08 14:38:54] <ChikaSan> Are you still bad at this video game mr streamer?
[2023-01-08 14:38:56] <%Lemings> Yeah, twitch streamers played a massive part in that
[2023-01-08 14:38:57] <%fredboi1> Gotta be on that gamer grind bro
[2023-01-08 14:39:00] <%Jacobian1979> as soon as people can make money from something.... it becomes super serious
[2023-01-08 14:39:05] <%boosted9946> dont need to be a streamer to be a pro gamer, gamer

[2023-01-08 14:39:43] <%+foreverfussy> i do wonder how it will impact society in the future, all my friends kids have no interest in getting a 'normal' job
[2023-01-08 14:39:47] <mrmelmann> I grew up playing Blops/blops 2/Ghosts/pubg/CS, the sweat era hadnt been formed yet, so it was just fun being able to use whatever gun, whatever strat, just enjoy stomping on noobs basically... now days they remove the ability to see KD ratios and also SBMM
[2023-01-08 14:39:47] <%$TGplaysgames> I need boomer lobbies asap
[2023-01-08 14:39:52] <%+KiwiJimm> A lot of people got paid to playe video games during the pandemic... Even if thier employers may not have realised tha's what they were paying for :-)
[2023-01-08 14:40:01] <%TrepieGGEZ> well its like any hobby, a lot of people like football a lot and they play as if its the only thing that matters to them
[2023-01-08 14:40:13] <%Jacobian1979> @Lemings yeah its side effect for sure
[2023-01-08 14:40:14] <%TrepieGGEZ> its good to aspire to be good at something and be motivated
[2023-01-08 14:40:15] <+AsBeane> online games are alot less casual now
[2023-01-08 14:40:22] <%KalaSeven> early quake days, lans were pretty sweaty and the lan tourneys
[2023-01-08 14:40:24] <%fredboi1> did you just put it up for 11 or 111
[2023-01-08 14:40:25] <%Lemings> I remember CoD2 and CoD4 didn't have nearly as bad sweats. Even MW2, though youtube montages and such did have an impact

[2023-01-08 14:40:38] <mrmelmann> @Lemings absolutely.
[2023-01-08 14:40:45] <%+KiwiJimm> I couldnt be a pro streamer... To much hard work. I admire the good folk who can do it.

[2023-01-08 14:41:30] <+AsBeane> @lemings think mw2 was the first multiplayer game where a learned about meta
[2023-01-08 14:41:42] <%+KiwiJimm> Yeah. Ok maybe to much anxiety then
[2023-01-08 14:41:52] <+je_suis_rozz> people think streaming is just chillin out and playing but nope it has to be taken as a job and real work
[2023-01-08 14:41:52] <%Lemings> AsBeane Yeah, youtube videos about what weapon is the best and such, those really took off with MW2
[2023-01-08 14:41:55] <+Grarc_og> Lots of people worry about job stability
[2023-01-08 14:41:59] <%Cartster> I think even when you do something you love enough it becomes a job @BreaK
[2023-01-08 14:41:59] <%Sh3rf> @KiwiJimm You're basically on a zero hour contract.
[2023-01-08 14:42:14] <%+KiwiJimm> @Sh3rf Yeah that...
[2023-01-08 14:42:16] <mrmelmann> Relativity is a big factor, relatability as well.
[2023-01-08 14:42:16] <%+foreverfussy> i think thats true but i think certain streamers will never die out

[2023-01-08 15:13:13] <OLYSvk> @Jay_G_TV scav is AI, PMC is character that you play and bring your gear in
[2023-01-08 15:13:44] <%+Jay_G_TV> @OLYSvk ohh so you only ever play as pmc? im assuminf a scav run is just to kill scavs?

[2023-01-08 15:14:29] <OLYSvk> @Jay_G_TV every 20-30 mins you can join a game as a scav (you literally join instead of AI) and then you loot and extract, that is meant to be free money pretty much

[2023-01-08 17:03:41] <%+shakclefurd> 15 to 20 depending on what it is, because they dont want to pay wait staff regular wages
[2023-01-08 17:03:46] <@%Breakspear> imagine not paying a standard wage

[2023-01-08 17:03:55] <SOLOxRetina> Tbh it depends on the service. If they suck then I’m tipping 10%. If they are good then 20% or more

[2023-01-08 17:03:57] <%Kezzran> It's so the business owners can pay the employees shit and make the customers feel sorry for them and make up their wages

[2023-01-08 17:04:40] <+TheLunarnaut> Yeah, so I dont think the tipping culture is a good thing, because of the economic implications it has. It demonstrates a policy failure.
[2023-01-08 17:04:47] <%Kezzran> @NotThatDre It's America, we are great in some ways, and really really suck in others
[2023-01-08 17:04:50] <%fredboi1> Imo you shouldnt have to rely on tips to live
[2023-01-08 17:04:55] <+wonderbuffin> the problem is nothing is standard here, so you have places that pay a fair wage and some places that pay a few bucks an hour
[2023-01-08 17:04:57] <%harrylg1> what do you usually tip garold? they'll be lucky to get 5% from me

[2023-01-08 17:05:18] <serpyboy> in Canada, minimum wage and "tipped minimum" wage are different, but tipped minimum is still over $10/hr
[2023-01-08 17:05:29] <%not_quite_elite> Thats what I get, I work 30hrs a week for Tesco
[2023-01-08 17:05:36] <%Kezzran> You have to think of states as almost countries to themselves, thus the wildly different wage structures, etc.

[2023-01-08 17:06:49] <NLD1st> the biggest issue with minimum wages in the state's is that it doesn't get inflation adjusted by default
[2023-01-08 17:06:49] <%+JoeJoetheMagicChimp> The federal minimum wage is $7.25 an hour

[2023-01-08 17:07:33] <%NewCoffeePlus> all of the us needs to be at least taht
[2023-01-08 17:07:36] <%ThinnishExpert> States can make it higher but not lower
[2023-01-08 17:07:36] <%+cfo_Hashtag> thats the lowest any state can go
[2023-01-08 17:07:39] <serpyboy> doesnt apply to certain industries though
[2023-01-08 17:07:43] <%+LzLuke> If you have federal policies, and state policies, do you have twice as many policy makers?
[2023-01-08 17:07:45] <+BeardedBrosefus> that doesn't include service industry
[2023-01-08 17:07:47] <+BeardedBrosefus> no
[2023-01-08 17:07:52] <%rincon805> its $15.50/hr for california min wage
[2023-01-08 17:07:56] <%+cfo_Hashtag> that doesnt apply to Tipped minimum wage
[2023-01-08 17:07:57] <TrinidadHype> states usually make it higher tho no?
[2023-01-08 17:08:01] <%DarthBrooks__> wait staff can get paid less than min wage
[2023-01-08 17:08:01] <serpyboy> you are correct about that pay
[2023-01-08 17:08:05] <%NewCoffeePlus> tip wages
[2023-01-08 17:08:07] <%ThinnishExpert> They have to compensate if tipped pay doesn't bring it to 7.25
[2023-01-08 17:08:10] <+b3rm> Correct
[2023-01-08 17:08:13] <%Nadool> when i was waiting tables it was $2.13
[2023-01-08 17:08:15] <BIGxREDxBUTTON> There are two standards for minimum wage, There is a federal minimum wage and a state minimum wage.
[2023-01-08 17:08:16] <%+LzLuke> federal = minimum to be legal right? So states have to be that or higher?
[2023-01-08 17:08:18] <%+cfo_Hashtag> tipped minimum is like 2.50 or something
[2023-01-08 17:08:24] <%Kezzran> Tipped minimum wage is $2.13/hr @BreaK
[2023-01-08 17:08:31] <Turncoat667> so yeah in some states if they dont make minimum off that they have to pay the balance
[2023-01-08 17:08:37] <Turncoat667> but its still shit
[2023-01-08 17:08:39] <%+NotThatDre> So the owners are pushing the employment cost onto the customers. I have no problem tipping if the service is good and I want to show my appreciation, it's just a nice thing to do. The dynamic that it's expected as default for everything because they're not paid enough is bonkers.
[2023-01-08 17:08:42] <%Nadool> the company I worked for never paid me a single paycheck. Every single pay stub the whole time I was there was $0.00
[2023-01-08 17:08:45] <%OnThePooper> if tips are used to augment normal wages, then federal minimum is like $2.15/hr  If an employee does not make at least federal minimum wage including the tips, the employer has to make up the difference.
[2023-01-08 17:08:48] <%Nadool> it was all tips

[2023-01-08 17:09:13] <+TheLunarnaut> Yeah I believe service industry works differently, so it is more exploitative in a lot of ways, so companies in those industries can skirt regulation more so than other industries.

[2023-01-08 17:09:24] <+Brian_TheDad> I made $2.13 a hour waiting tables and if with tips you did not make minimal wage the business had to make up the difference, but I made a ton in my early 20’s waiting tables. I made around $40k a year
[2023-01-08 17:09:25] <%+62Scorch> minimum wage for tipped employees in Wisconsin is $2.33 an hour
[2023-01-08 17:09:36] <%Kezzran> Then fuck you
[2023-01-08 17:09:37] <+TheLunarnaut> YEP
[2023-01-08 17:09:49] <+TheLunarnaut> Then you're fucked
[2023-01-08 17:09:55] <%Nadool> if you make no tips then the company has to pay the actual minimum wage
[2023-01-08 17:09:55] <+TheLunarnaut> basically
[2023-01-08 17:09:58] <%+DeebsShoryu> it was funny when i waited tables and would get paychecks for 0 dollars, because taxes from my tips would come out of my wages
[2023-01-08 17:09:59] <%Kezzran> @62Scorch What up man, from Wisconsin? I'm south of Madison
[2023-01-08 17:10:00] <serpyboy> some states: fuck you, your own fault. other states: business has to make it up
[2023-01-08 17:10:04] <rattrap_yt> business has to make the difference up to the minimum wage, generally
[2023-01-08 17:10:06] <%+FACE_UK> u get paid the difference if u dont get tipped
[2023-01-08 17:10:13] <serpyboy> that depends on the state @BreaK
[2023-01-08 17:10:18] <%Kezzran> or not
[2023-01-08 17:10:18] <%+cfo_Hashtag> depends on the state
[2023-01-08 17:10:24] <%Nadool> you get paid the real minimum wage, which is more than the $2.13
[2023-01-08 17:10:25] <rattrap_yt> but minimum wage federally is $7.25 still
[2023-01-08 17:10:28] <ryanfack> yeah
[2023-01-08 17:10:28] <%harrylg1> yeah
[2023-01-08 17:10:29] <%+CG_EpiCc> yeah
[2023-01-08 17:10:32] <%Rastah_Mouse> yeah
[2023-01-08 17:10:34] <+TheLunarnaut> That is a per business thing I think though, or per state thing. It's a fucked up system
[2023-01-08 17:10:36] <%Josh_93_> It happens in the UK with commission break
[2023-01-08 17:10:46] <Dillingfram> If you work at the right restaurant in the right city you can make decent money
[2023-01-08 17:10:47] <%fin186> isnt that a hotel?
[2023-01-08 17:10:51] <%Kezzran> Taking tips is illegal, typically
[2023-01-08 17:10:52] <%Josh_93_> Its called minimum wage top up
[2023-01-08 17:10:52] <%ThinnishExpert> That's draconian
[2023-01-08 17:10:57] <+TheLunarnaut> Some places pool tips too @BreaK
[2023-01-08 17:10:57] <%+DeebsShoryu> that's super illegal

[2023-01-08 17:13:03] <+Snarfe_o7> tips by cash are legally the property of the person receiving, but tiping by the card is up to the business to decide if or who gets it
[2023-01-08 17:13:05] <%+LzLuke> In some countries tipping is seen as pity so shouldn't be done
