[2022-12-10 15:39:51] <%+thatkief> wow
[2022-12-10 15:39:53] <xryancat> if moving every 3-5 years, renting can be better, because you might not be able to get a benefit from selling with swings in the market and selling costs
[2022-12-10 15:39:54] <DragJJ> fucking hell thats lucky
[2022-12-10 15:40:03] <%+DuckieSouls> I got a mortgage for a better place for less than what I was renting before
[2022-12-10 15:40:25] <jimjim1234321> some companies offer goods for a sick rate of 24% apr what a good deal

[2022-12-10 15:40:41] <ProjectAzre> living paycheck to paycheck here its just sad shit
[2022-12-10 15:40:46] <absynth123> It's impossible to find affordable housing here, rental companies own everything and houses cost millions of dollars
[2022-12-10 15:40:46] <vRandell> make it make sense
[2022-12-10 15:40:46] <%+thatkief> thats really good lowest rates got to in US was 2.5% around end of 2021
[2022-12-10 15:40:51] <jimjim1234321> do you remember when the queen was invested in Wonga which was the ultimate scam company
[2022-12-10 15:40:51] <bigboytinkle> Oh ok good

[2022-12-10 15:41:13] <%+DvDPlayerDuder> I just hope I can get a cheaper mortgage in a few years, 3,6% isn't it
[2022-12-10 15:41:17] <absynth123> It's not unusual for people to spend 50-90% of their income on rent here, with no other options. You're either a serf or you're homeless
[2022-12-10 15:41:18] <+Dairychuk> ur a sick cunt, one of a kind. not luck!
