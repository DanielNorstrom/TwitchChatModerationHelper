[2023-01-04 19:00:55] <@^StreamElements> I must not panic. Panic is the mind-killer. Panic is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my panic. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the panic has gone there will be nothing. Only cat-strimmer will remain

[2023-01-04 21:13:20] <+kolyarut> That's the smartest thing about TFT's design tbh, it automatically counters any potential OP comp by dropping its effectiveness when spammed. Would be nice if the UI was a little clearer about that rather than depending on card counting, but eh, still a good system

[2023-01-04 21:55:18] <@^StreamElements> I must not panic. Panic is the mind-killer. Panic is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my panic. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the panic has gone there will be nothing. Only cat-strimmer will remain

[2023-01-04 21:55:29] <@^StreamElements> I am the fear of my panic. anxiety is my body, and fright is my blood. I have survived over a thousand jumpscares. Unknown to calm, nor known to composure. Have withstood poise to create many dreads yet those hands shall never hold anything. so, as I pray, unlimited panic works

[2023-01-04 22:17:44] <saitax_07> so, the better VR tracking => less motion sickness???
[2023-01-04 22:17:47] <%Vandercat> I definitely recommend not getting the meta headsets if you ever do get one
[2023-01-04 22:17:51] <%gadongadonk> You should try Hotdogs Horseshoes and Handgrenades! I wanna see green chaos cat figure out firearms
[2023-01-04 22:18:02] <limoea> I once almost tripped over absolutely nothing when playing VR because my Body thought I was moving but I wasn't
[2023-01-04 22:18:06] <%DesuTroya> I've tried several headsets and the best by far is the Index. I also wear glasses, which made a difference

[2023-01-04 22:20:01] <Neonterror> so its like an autochess thing
[2023-01-04 22:20:03] <PacmanGodOfAll> its like chess but pokemon

[2023-01-04 22:51:54] <+GhostV2> Actually, thinking on it, I have had a fish taco with purple cabbage before
[2023-01-04 22:51:58] <%GeorgePlaysTwitch> In a world where people put pineapple on pizza, there is no god and no order to the universe and you can put cabbage in burritos too. or anything in/on anything.

[2023-01-04 23:15:40] <%Jerzeem> I know 50 shades started as a Twilight fanfic
[2023-01-04 23:15:40] <%TeifitV> I didn't know about the BL origin
[2023-01-04 23:15:45] <%+bluedude153> Oh wow so 50 Shades being a twilight fanfic is things just going full circle then
[2023-01-04 23:15:48] <boosterjuice1> it was a MCR fanfic IIRC
[2023-01-04 23:15:55] <%+yo_itsLinds> you're right
[2023-01-04 23:16:00] <%DedlokPM> And then Fifty Shades of Grey was intially a fanfic of Twilight
[2023-01-04 23:16:01] <@%$zMiyuZ> both were fanfics
[2023-01-04 23:16:02] <%$LarryTheCountryWalrus> 50 shades

[2023-01-04 23:16:41] <Sir_Khris> is star wars episode 7,8,9 considered fan fic? purrThink

[2023-01-04 23:17:00] <%Bazeio> girldmPeepeehands first lux now DM? Poor ez cant catch a break
[2023-01-04 23:17:10] <+Penguino_Rojo> @Sir_Khris Official Fan fic, just like the 'Expanded Universe' Novel line of old
[2023-01-04 23:17:11] <%$earin_copper> But Stephanie Meyer said the idea for Twilight came to her in a dream, it's definitely OC, donut steel
[2023-01-04 23:17:14] <DagronIX> Now that sounds like a fanfic
[2023-01-04 23:17:14] <%Melancholy_mage> Did I sign up for boys love? Is that participating or appreciating?

[2023-01-04 23:18:12] <+Penguino_Rojo> @TeifitV expanded universe was never canon anyway.  Lucas had a very clear rule on that in case he ever made more SW movies

[2023-01-04 23:18:33] <%Melancholy_mage> I wrote a fanfic once. It was MLPFiM. I nearly finished it too. Even put it up online. It was surprisingly popular. Dunno if I‚Äôd do that now though.

[2023-01-04 23:21:03] <+schmashlafu> fired. Crispy skin
[2023-01-04 23:21:07] <+Rapcix> yeah baking is good, usually with some lemon zest/ juice and garnish
[2023-01-04 23:21:09] <%ynlokk> hm... salted, and then grilled on a hot pan for me.

[2023-01-04 23:21:20] <%$LarryTheCountryWalrus> you'll want some kind of heat source i think
[2023-01-04 23:21:22] <%gadongadonk> Get some lemon in there too, if you like lemon
[2023-01-04 23:21:24] <%Jerzeem> if you have a deep fryer, you can deep fry it while it's frozen
[2023-01-04 23:21:24] <+Flat_Land_Snake> wrap in foil to grill it
[2023-01-04 23:21:24] <Vew_TV> if you have a grill, imo it's best on the grill - make sure you salt and pepper it on all sides, and make rectangular stakes, it goes well with grilled vegetables
[2023-01-04 23:21:25] <@%$zMiyuZ> make a campfire and cook there
[2023-01-04 23:21:26] <+GhostV2> I mean thaw before attempting to cook, as the frozone will affect how easily salmon cooks
[2023-01-04 23:21:28] <$Purple_Jester> aluminum foil
[2023-01-04 23:21:31] <%Kherbellos> if you use heat to melt the frozen salmon brick, it gets softer
[2023-01-04 23:21:38] <lewiserox> You could bake it with lemon, butter, parsley, garlic
[2023-01-04 23:21:42] <%+bluedude153> Could do the ol' dishwasher salmon
[2023-01-04 23:21:43] <%Dornarr> You can steam them. But if they are still frozen this may not a thing girldmLUL
[2023-01-04 23:21:48] <Vew_TV> not even a grill pan?
[2023-01-04 23:21:48] <+B_As_In_Bacon> could use a broiling pan I think... or foil

[2023-01-04 23:25:34] <+hoetz90> you could cut the frozen salmon and then frie it up with some garlic and herbs
[2023-01-04 23:25:34] <%+bluedude153> you hate the ocean

[2023-01-04 23:27:15] <%GeorgePlaysTwitch> most important thing about prepping salmon is that it doesn't need hellfire. it wants to turn rosy and flaky, not charred.

[2023-01-04 23:31:02] <%gadongadonk> @Siriusv7 The reason they get scared is because something is suddenly behind them, without them knowing
