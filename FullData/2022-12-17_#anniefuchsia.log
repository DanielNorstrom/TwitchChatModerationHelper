[2022-12-17 00:38:40] <%JurgenRapp> ChatGPT is actually crazy, if you are working with code and haven't tried it, try it. It's like stackoverflow on steroids
[2022-12-17 00:45:31] <%NoName6834> Sadge
[2022-12-17 00:45:44] <%JurgenRapp> It gives me the feeling that AI will change everything, ChatGPT instead of linking you to same place where you can find info, it just tells you about any and everything. Google is dead.
[2022-12-17 00:46:51] <%JurgenRapp> I was asking how to write a json deserialzier and it just gave me the code for what I wanted to do. Give it a year...

[2022-12-17 13:06:19] <Kaninslaktaren> I think that the Wow Token have had a huge inpackt on the AH, and it have created a type of inflation in the game. It locks out people who dont have the time to farm gold from the late game activites that requires Pots, Enchants, etc.  Thats jus my 2 cents around the tokens

[2022-12-17 14:38:46] <camelkintwitch> It sounds like a lot of information but I think what he's saying is you need to distill the important information and apply what works for you.

[2022-12-17 14:40:20] <%Fingerlickins> DankWizard420  depends on the viewership you gathered tho, like all the lefty essey videos are like 45-2h long and get millions of views. Just look at contrapoints channel, her longest video is 1.40h and is at close to 5m views. BUT its prob not going to work for wow content unless its like more stuff
