[2022-12-19 02:44:02] <%+rolfkip> Don’t mean there’s no truth there, but it’s as pop psych as like enneagram or mbti nowadays

[2022-12-19 02:44:29] <%+bustingcaps> BRUTAL
[2022-12-19 02:44:38] <RainbowRushh> mbti is cap

[2022-12-19 22:08:36] <+Minimancer27> talent is almost a dirty word, or an excuse, "I wish I was as talented as saint so I could have played league pro" maan you worked so hard
[2022-12-19 22:08:36] <%$UserJoe> Also a lot of times you have to eat shit for awhile before it breaks through for you.
[2022-12-19 22:08:42] <%noname313> And you need some luck too
