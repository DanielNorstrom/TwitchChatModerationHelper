[2022-12-14 18:59:44] <@%^StreamElements> I must not panic. Panic is the mind-killer. Panic is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my panic. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the panic has gone there will be nothing. Only cat-strimmer will remain
[2022-12-14 18:59:50] <%+GryphonSDK> @Jerzeem I dunno if it's really pre-cat-chat, since cat is always watching.

You danced right out of my life… and my heart. I’ve just followed rosedoodle, so long, dm. Hope it was worth it.

[2022-12-14 19:54:02] <%Alno_> @snek981 it's more a way to save an image. The lines get saved as coordinates that get redrawn whenever you resize the image. You never get visible pixels that way, no matter how much you zoom in. But you habe to make it that way from the get go.

[2022-12-14 20:02:44] <Ryxhen> Fair enough
[2022-12-14 20:02:46] <%$MammalianHybrid> I think it can also have a place in game dev -- implement a bunch of maps, "tile" the cities, and use it to generate a city or parts of a city
[2022-12-14 20:02:47] <+sonicthebagel> AI art is like saying the paintbrush is the artist tbh. But it's really good at generating convincing images at face value

[2022-12-14 20:10:40] <%barrettsmithbb> @clockworkcontrivance But... Meta-verse!!
[2022-12-14 20:10:44] <%clockworkcontrivance> @barrettsmithbb unfortunately the media landscape operates in a way that highly incentives that kind of completely overblown stuff because it gets clicks. so they share it
[2022-12-14 20:10:55] <%MisfitAF> Rich tech bros are unfortunately their own kind of breed, living in their own bubble, where they only really listen to eachother.

[2022-12-14 20:11:14] <@%zMiyuZ> @clockworkcontrivance I hate the word metaverse so much, but the concept is cool of a vr world
[2022-12-14 20:11:18] <%+TangledTunic> Media likes headlines that get clicks and so they will make a situation sound a lot more dramatic
[2022-12-14 20:11:18] <%$Bazeio> @clockworkcontrivance AI is a problem on itself. sometimes it cause more problems, sometimes we can only do stuff based on  ai. like tracking
[2022-12-14 20:11:24] <%barrettsmithbb> @clockworkcontrivance And then companies make actions on it and immediately get called out by its users.  CSP and Artstation being notable examples currently LUL

[2022-12-14 20:11:34] <SeeAndShudder> I think foundationally the problem of ethical sourcing of where they get their images runs into a core issue that a person is able to learn and view images without the artists permission, but at the current juncture, the neural network component isn’t developed enough to make that argument for the versions you rent for access to like NovelAI and Midjourney

[2022-12-14 21:18:09] <@%Aozora7> We should add "what program" to !what command
[2022-12-14 21:18:14] <noctis_3d> 3D is easier, but also harder.
[2022-12-14 21:18:14] <%DesuTroya> It's so odd. I never hear this kind of conversation with other art streamers.

[2022-12-14 21:18:36] <a_real_bird> at this point could re-play the same stream and it would maybe work out :)
[2022-12-14 21:18:44] <%Melancholy_mage> That’s an idea, but it may not be a ‘good’ idea.
[2022-12-14 21:18:44] <%$DukeCephalopod> the secret is that it _does_ require the blessing of a catgirl vtuber but uh you've also solved that problem
[2022-12-14 21:18:47] <%+Sovereignwind> I would like to be able to draw, but i really don't care enough to take the time to learn properly. ah, apathy
[2022-12-14 21:18:48] <%$EmberUshi> OH WOW I haven't heard this song in like, 10 years, from someone mic spamming it in TF2
[2022-12-14 21:18:48] <Sir_Khris> ! is the thing that lets twitch/bot know that its a command :/

[2022-12-14 22:18:48] <@%zMiyuZ> how the hecc I was into nightcores, it is so bad
[2022-12-14 22:18:49] <%+Protostalkerr> Thats what I played it on
[2022-12-14 22:18:53] <%Melancholy_mage> Speedy remixes of this always feel a little weird, because the original is such a slow, sweet ballad.
[2022-12-14 22:18:57] <%snek981> this music with the undertones of coffee shop jazz is....interesting
[2022-12-14 22:19:08] <Sir_Khris> theres another version ofthis song that I like as well but can't recall off the top of my head.
[2022-12-14 22:19:14] <%shadon555> my brain couldnt keep up with ddr ;-;

[2022-12-14 22:19:40] <%clockworkcontrivance> my best friend played so much DDR that she got self conscious about her calf muscles
[2022-12-14 22:19:51] <elfranne> apart from Initial D... what other anime has Euroobeat ?
[2022-12-14 22:19:59] <%Melancholy_mage> Yea, speedy cake is great, but the original by Mike Oldfield is a simple guitar ballad.
