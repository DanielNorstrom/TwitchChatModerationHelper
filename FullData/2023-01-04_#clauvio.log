[2023-01-04 02:40:54] <%BearEatSalmon> saga is definitely inspired by stuff like ultima & wizardry where the manuals of those games are explicitly like "if you get bad rolls on character creation oh well just start again" so its very...stubborn i guess
[2023-01-04 02:40:55] <TheLeadingCat> The core mechanics are similar, but you can't, for example, grind... And there isn't a linear story. It's more like old school American RPG's in that way.
[2023-01-04 02:41:14] <Streamers_Psychosis> oldvio
[2023-01-04 02:41:26] <TheLeadingCat> It's fun if you have played games like Wizardry or Might and Magic.
[2023-01-04 02:41:56] <@%KafroHudrep> i still think you should have started with SaGa 1 or 2 on the game boy those are much more palatable and linear while still having the series' eccentricities
[2023-01-04 02:42:05] <%Burzan> @BearEatSalmon that's probably downstream from old RPGs being based off of D&D
[2023-01-04 02:42:06] <@%KafroHudrep> people also say SaGa Scarlet Grace is really good
[2023-01-04 02:42:15] <PunkAzn> ah yeah, jabubus stomach
[2023-01-04 02:42:21] <%BearEatSalmon> scarlet grace sounds like the most fun game ever
[2023-01-04 02:42:24] <benito_mescalini> If you don't know anything about Wizardry or Might and Magic you should watch some SsethTseentach videos

[2023-01-04 03:09:57] <GenericMattr> you can glitch the boomerang on with equip swap. it's so useful it's dumb that it's not normally allowed
[2023-01-04 03:10:14] <%BlueBlazeGX> FUn fact, there are glitches that allow items to be interchangable between kid and adult. Mainly for speedrun stuffs
[2023-01-04 03:10:29] <i_am_jessa> @BlueBlazeGX is the rang any better than the hookshot though?
[2023-01-04 03:10:32] <GenericMattr> yep that's equip swap blue

[2023-01-04 03:11:07] <%D00bius> My favorite trivia is how you speedrun Paper Mario by playing this game first

[2023-01-04 03:11:18] <%BlueBlazeGX> Cuz there totally isnt an arrowhead on the end of the hookshot Kappa
[2023-01-04 03:11:30] <i_am_jessa> @D00bius I love that speedrun route, yeah
[2023-01-04 03:11:48] <i_am_jessa> you hotswap the cartridge
[2023-01-04 03:11:59] <%BlueBlazeGX> Paper Mario such a cozy game clauviSway
[2023-01-04 03:12:06] <@%KafroHudrep> yo she found the speedrun route on the back of the knee
[2023-01-04 03:12:09] <PityBurger> The Gamecube one is so good
[2023-01-04 03:12:21] <GenericMattr> this game has arbitrary code execution so you can manipulate the consoles memory values to certain values and hot swap to have it set up for a credits warp
[2023-01-04 03:12:28] <%D00bius> The N64 itself saves data in the ram temporarily after shut down, so you can abuse that

[2023-01-04 03:13:33] <Namington2D> snacko1Soon
[2023-01-04 03:13:40] <GenericMattr> there is no way to softlock this duengon without glitches so you cannot be stuck
[2023-01-04 03:13:48] <%godot_was_here> the feeling of washing your sheets and knowing you will be able to sleep in freshly washed sheets the same night
[2023-01-04 03:13:51] <%godot_was_here> that's it baby
[2023-01-04 03:13:52] <PityBurger> This temple has a notorious key that's a little tricky.
[2023-01-04 03:14:24] <i_am_jessa> yeah, Paper Mario doesn't clear the expansion RAM for the n64, so you can use glitches to write code to it with OoT, and then use glitches in Paper Mario to run the code
[2023-01-04 03:14:26] <%BlueBlazeGX> @godot_was_here That, and warm pants right out of the drier on a cold winter night
[2023-01-04 03:14:40] <PunkAzn> the one key is reeaaaal

[2023-01-04 03:17:47] <i_am_jessa> might as well go for one of the japan ones with all the bells and whistles
[2023-01-04 03:17:58] <%Burzan> yeah a bidet is like $50 at most

[2023-01-04 03:19:19] <Namington2D> what would a toilet have bells for

[2023-01-04 04:11:55] <Temporal_Paradox> it's not exactly maze like, but there's something about it that gets disorienting
[2023-01-04 04:12:02] <Temporal_Paradox> maybe because it all looks so similar
[2023-01-04 04:12:22] <%godot_was_here> it's not really a water temple so much as a wherer temple
[2023-01-04 04:12:48] <PunkAzn> no real camera control doesn't help either

[2023-01-04 04:14:16] <Temporal_Paradox> the most frustrating part for me was how slow it all was. waiting for water to raise and lower, slowly swimming around, or floating/sinking. In and out of menus. Every action has some wait involved and it all adds up
[2023-01-04 04:14:38] <FakeKraid> Yeah, if not for the delay this dungeon wouldn't really be that bad
[2023-01-04 04:14:58] <PunkAzn> entering menus add up overtime yeah
[2023-01-04 04:15:08] <Temporal_Paradox> It's like every step has a delay attached to it. You always have to wait for the next step when water is involved

[2023-01-04 04:15:20] <FakeKraid> A lot of how utterly horrible it was for players back then was just because players weren't used to navigating complex 3D spaces like this, much less when there were puzzles involved
[2023-01-04 04:15:58] <FakeKraid> Whereas today the issue is that the game's overall interface design and animations just aren't good by modern standards
[2023-01-04 04:16:33] <GenericMattr> this game has one of the coolest glitchless speedruns to this day.

[2023-01-04 04:17:56] <Temporal_Paradox> Yeah, they're related to those jumping spiders in the old 2d games

[2023-01-04 04:53:25] <PityBurger> There's a little bit of truth in that. This game for example has a lot of input lag on Nintendo's emulator. That, combined with bluetooth lag for joycon, and general LCD lag makes the whole experience significantly less responsive than on original hardware/CRT.
[2023-01-04 04:53:26] <Mandritti> A controller with macros is different, but perhaps close.
[2023-01-04 04:53:28] <Temporal_Paradox> purists to that degree can be a bit weird. Some things like using a crt tv has some basis behind it though, some art was designed with it in mind
[2023-01-04 04:53:34] <Mandritti> And other modded hardware is the same idea.
[2023-01-04 04:54:09] <papercompass> speaking of N64 controllers, it's pretty ridiculous how the control stick wears itself down

[2023-01-04 04:55:55] <Mandritti> The relevance of saying "it's a different game" depends on what you're arguing with that.  And gatekeeping the experience is indeed lame.
[2023-01-04 04:55:56] <PityBurger> OOT is totally fine no matter how you play it, but seeing the little issues like how sensitive the hookshot/bow aiming is on switch makes me sad. The original doesn't have these control issues.

[2023-01-04 04:57:19] <%Mattlava> fun fact, his max health is actually tied to yours, so if you never collected heart containers hed also only have 3 hearts
[2023-01-04 04:57:27] <papercompass> @MintCastella sorry. I think I worded that wrong.
[2023-01-04 04:57:30] <@%KafroHudrep> you actually can just beat him in a straight up sword duel too but the game isn't really Built for that
[2023-01-04 04:57:37] <%+Admiral_PopnFresh> Personally, I like the idea of going 2 hand weapon to a defeat an enemy with your primary weapon set
[2023-01-04 04:57:46] <%NaelLacertus> Power of nut n hammer instead!
[2023-01-04 04:57:57] <@%KafroHudrep> this guide also says you could have used two items to cheese the fight but you don't have either lol

[2023-01-04 07:14:02] <Redamaford> The rumble pack was a thing you plugged into the back of the N64 controller, which vibrated.
[2023-01-04 07:14:03] <Rhisket> woah rumblepack is a throw back
[2023-01-04 07:14:04] <i_am_jessa> Original n64 controllers didn't have rumble built in, you needed a rumble pak to plug into it
[2023-01-04 07:14:11] <%MrFoois> it plugged into that slot in the back of the controller
[2023-01-04 07:14:18] <PunkAzn> rumble pack is before controllers had rumble built in
[2023-01-04 07:14:18] <%BlueBlazeGX> A Rumble Pack would be plugged into the N64, this thing would use that lol
[2023-01-04 07:14:20] <Redamaford> It used the memory card slot though, which was a pain in the butt.
[2023-01-04 07:14:22] <%supermariogravyboat> N64 had a separate rumble motor, took batteries, very rumbly
