[2023-01-03 19:34:30] <AngraMainu> @Till_Ya i understand that, but you said those are smurf accounts. Aint "smurfing" meaning playing with players that have far worse skill elo than you? and how much higher can you get than top 500
[2023-01-03 19:35:05] <AngraMainu> wouldnt smurfs be playing on gold or plat or something
[2023-01-03 19:35:12] <Till_Ya> @AngraMainu smurf just means its not your "main account"

[2023-01-03 19:36:01] <+Azure_Black> @AngraMainu I thought smurf was godlike player choosing to play in lower ranks to troll. XDDD
[2023-01-03 19:36:10] <AngraMainu> @Till_Ya smurfs would intentionally throw to lower their rank wouldnt they
[2023-01-03 19:36:19] <AngraMainu> @Azure_Black yeah exactly
[2023-01-03 19:36:23] <Till_Ya> @AngraMainu they are still considered smurfs - you can call em alt account if you like :)
[2023-01-03 19:36:38] <AngraMainu> @Till_Ya k then
[2023-01-03 19:37:08] <+FighterOfTheNiteMan> noobs will say "deadeye is easy" but it's actually really hard to pull off good ones
[2023-01-03 19:37:10] <Till_Ya> they all start at gold/plat and that time is called smurfing. But people use to call every alt account a smurf no matter of rank
[2023-01-03 19:37:22] <+Azure_Black> Wouldn't "Gatekeeper" be another word for "Smurf"? Keeping those low levels from progressing upwards?

[2023-01-03 19:38:18] <AngraMainu> "In online gaming, a smurf is an experienced player who uses a new account to deceive other players into thinking he's a noob (newbie). The purpose is usually to play against less skilled opponents who will under-estimate the 'smurf'. The expected result is that the smurf will pwn (dominate) his opponents and humiliate them further as they have been now beaten by an apparent noob."

[2023-01-03 19:39:06] <Till_Ya> @AngraMainu yes and thats true - but I was talking about what people mean by calling alt accounts smurfs
[2023-01-03 19:39:31] <Till_Ya> as a plat player you can smurf in gold
[2023-01-03 19:39:37] <AngraMainu> @Till_Ya thanks for explaining buddy

[2023-01-03 19:39:44] <cazzador> smurfing yes is more like a high rank player playing in a lower rank to play against players worse than them, but alts are any type of other account besides the player's original account.
