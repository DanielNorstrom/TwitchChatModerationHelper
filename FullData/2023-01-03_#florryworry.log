[2023-01-03 11:42:44] <Mawan> Hello offline chat, is there a time Florry usually starts streaming ? Or does it change every time ?
[2023-01-03 11:45:28] <%海豹兄貴 (laiwaihin)> Usally around 12 PM CEST
[2023-01-03 11:48:12] <Mawan> thanks !
[2023-01-03 11:49:05] <@%$euivalexander> late
[2023-01-03 11:49:06] <@^Nightbot> Chat is not cute enough to be blessed with stream. For now... NODDERS
[2023-01-03 11:53:08] <@%DonPedry> !schedule @Mawan YEP
[2023-01-03 11:53:08] <@^Nightbot> @Mawan - standard schedule is: 78% chance of stream on Mon, Tue, Thu and Fri, 49% chance of stream on Sat and Sun, 7% chance of stream (mainly to pay stream debt) on Wed YEP 56% chance of stream starting betwen 11:00 and 12:00 CET/CEST otherwise later up to 15:00 CET/CEST https://www.worldtimebuddy.com
[2023-01-03 11:58:55] <Mawan> Are those actual statistics or just numbers he made up ? Its pretty funny ^^
[2023-01-03 12:00:41] <%CaptainAlex1701> Pretty sure they are not actual statistics but they are still somewhat representative :D

[2023-01-03 12:10:05] <@%DonPedry> @Mawan they're as accurate as EU4 siege chances, as you can tell by the numbers YEP
[2023-01-03 12:10:54] <@%DonPedry> Though they represent that's there's higher chance of stream on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday, with 50:50 on weekends
[2023-01-03 12:11:20] <@%DonPedry> and starting time, well, in theory between 11 and 12, but in recent months Florry has been oversleeping a lot pepeLaugh
[2023-01-03 12:30:25] <%CaptainAlex1701> "in recent months" KEKW
[2023-01-03 12:35:25] <@%DonPedry> There was a time when he was starting streams closer to 11 👴

[2023-01-03 14:11:30] <c_kyle29> @Florryworry I don't think you don't need 10% warscore fighting big countries. That only adds -1000, but if you use your magic, you can just get the score to be less than -1000 to counteract that

Otherwise the noble and intellectual Senatorial Republic might have been able to stem the tide of mob-rule under the the Caesars, that killed (and more immortally, culturally destroyed) VASTLY more than Sulla did trying to stop it.
