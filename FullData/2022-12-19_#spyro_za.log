[2022-12-19 11:32:46] <%insilico_man> it would have been a robbery imo if France won KEKW

[2022-12-19 11:35:52] <%sulttaan12> Dembele was good in Dortmund but as soon as he got in Barca he's been in the hospital every other day

[2022-12-19 14:35:08] <Bambus174> I didn't even know SK is busted. I just played my knights as always, wondering why there is SK everywhere. It was a pretty smooth ride.
[2022-12-19 14:35:37] <%Methaies> @elquellora_ but the game plan vs knights is much easier. just win r1 bleed scneario

[2022-12-19 15:59:09] <%Aigle_d_Argent_> During challenges such as faction challenge in the past or this winter one with quests, you can get faction border with 25 wins during challenge, or neutral border by winning 25 quests, so its doable during winter challenge
[2022-12-19 15:59:14] <SIypee> is he really that scared of vilge LULW
[2022-12-19 15:59:37] <%Aigle_d_Argent_> I came back in July on a new account and they haven’t done faction challenge or quest challenge until this winter
[2022-12-19 15:59:40] <@%+xahverius> @Aigle_d_Argent_ ok i forgor that, should try to get it
[2022-12-19 16:00:26] <SIypee> PepeLaugh
[2022-12-19 16:00:27] <%Aigle_d_Argent_> But i can’t understand why the winter challenge is based around wins with a timer and pretty long steps. Doesn’t really promote deck variety if you are looking for wins
