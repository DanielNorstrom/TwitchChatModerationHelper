[2022-12-22 00:10:23] <%+BoT_sLoThy> Hi Will, it's Andy from middle school, the kid you bullied for 3 years. After I got transferred to another school I had huge self-esteem issues and never made any friends. I turned to EFT, the only game that made me feel special at a 50% survival rate (i rat btw) but when I found out you're the top Tarkov streamer I got flashbacks from when you bullied me. There is no justice in this world.

[2022-12-22 00:19:42] <%slythiswaycomes> There were these three royal douches in our highschool that picked on a friend of mine for three years, school didnt do shit and the kid almost killed himself. This kid got an older friend from another grade above ours (through gaming) that came into our class (during a lesson) and dragged one of the bullies out of there and beat him to a pulp.   My most "punisher"-esque moment that i've witnessed i think.

[2022-12-22 18:44:31] <Brain64cores> @WillerZ Dont forget Infrastructure is not everything, you also need good routing and pings (ISP equimpent and more). I switched from cable 55/10 line to 1000/100, but pings got up from 45ms to 60ms, so its better for my work, but bad for competitive gaming
[2022-12-22 18:44:32] <johngjohn> is it all toz bullets of specific ones?

[2022-12-22 21:35:43] <jakehorowitz> @iSnipeLikeJesus who im full sprint i want it to half it instead of making me full walk
[2022-12-22 21:35:56] <%+highplainsdrifter> Underbarrel GL will be awesome but so expensive to run I bet
[2022-12-22 21:35:56] <%WazzuHahn> 100% testing for under barrel gl
[2022-12-22 21:35:57] <%+hirtchu> @highplainsdrifter the rounds also have a chance to not only misfeed but huge misfire chance too

[2022-12-22 21:36:32] <@%+2L33Zy> You have to bring like 12 toz, fold them up and only use one mag per toz
[2022-12-22 21:36:34] <+mavvkek> Im not sure why this would be testing for the UBGL when the regular GL is already in
[2022-12-22 21:36:36] <%Gingy> it's because you need a new gun for every explosive round
[2022-12-22 21:36:39] <sarasocretese> if they're still testing then wipe prolly won't be till the end of the month SeemsGood

[2022-12-22 21:42:18] <@%+2L33Zy> Discord wipe is happening rn I guess
[2022-12-22 21:42:22] <%+false_luck> flachette plus isn't "as bad" but its bad
[2022-12-22 21:42:22] <%Codyg7171> Where is the sign up sheet Mr Bruce Bruce Willer
[2022-12-22 21:42:27] <%moosenukl> its all fake
[2022-12-22 21:42:30] <%+highplainsdrifter> these wipe events are too weak to make me think wipe is in the next couple days. I bet next week
[2022-12-22 21:42:31] <%kkottttte> too late already
[2022-12-22 21:42:41] <%+captf1shyf1nger> no wipe ever
[2022-12-22 21:42:41] <sh0rtnblue> whats up everyone?

[2022-12-22 21:42:51] <sarasocretese> imagine if they're changing up skill leveling making it take less time to attain max skils and that's why we have this "max skill event" it'd be sick if they also increased the level cap to 100 and reworked xp again and added more "end game" stuff
[2022-12-22 21:42:51] <%lebewm> kinda dropping the ball on the wipe cycle tbh

[2022-12-22 23:11:37] <@%^Nightbot> Tips to make money during early wipe stages and sub level 40, is primarily supported by questing successfully and maximizing your efficiency by trying to plan ahead and group similar objective quests to do at the same time - saving time, increasing efficiency and maximizing time. Set yourself a goal before the raid, Focus - Then achieve, Then extract!

[2022-12-22 23:51:37] <%+glocknessmonstattv> @AlienNamedDave Honestly, that would be kinda cool. Have to finish streets quests before we can go anywhere else.
[2022-12-22 23:51:47] <2stepingsupra> GOOD gives a chance for newer players
[2022-12-22 23:51:52] <+mrqvp> 17?

[2022-12-22 23:52:18] <%moffatxx> if they dont implement a wipe system i feel the game would slowly dwindle away
[2022-12-22 23:52:18] <trickypig> Damn respect
[2022-12-22 23:52:21] <2stepingsupra> So hard for newer players to get into this game changing things up would help
[2022-12-22 23:52:23] <AlienNamedDave> if they are doing something like that, Nikkita has to be shitting himself excited for everyone to freak out lol
