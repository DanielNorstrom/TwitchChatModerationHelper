[2022-12-30 06:44:25] <$HowdyMcGee> Developers can act like Speedrunners are the villains but speedrunners help keep the longevity of a game or help product additional sales.

[2022-12-30 10:27:27] <%Necrofitz> I generally figure any game that is at least competently built enough to be playable from start to finish without major issues deserves a 4/10. I reserve 1 - 3 for totally broken garbage games.
[2022-12-30 10:29:11] <%+YamaJuugo> come to think of it honestly, Im probably just harsh with my ratings

[2022-12-30 10:30:05] <%Necrofitz> Agreed. I can never respect a 10/10 review because either the review doesn't actually speak to it being perfect, or the author is clearly ignoring imperfections to an unacceptable degree of bias.
[2022-12-30 10:30:25] <%RamboRachel> do you like FEAR 1 or 2 better? I just finished 2 today.

[2022-12-30 14:03:22] <LG_here> the blue balls NOO
[2022-12-30 14:03:36] <+Freckris> wants to make sure you went through the gas
[2022-12-30 14:03:45] <+Freckris> even though you don't have to turn the gas off???
[2022-12-30 14:03:46] <SGTX_> probably makes the game think you've already turned the valve
[2022-12-30 14:04:00] <CyanideCocoa> yeah dev probably found his own way to skip that section so he put an extra trigger in
[2022-12-30 14:04:04] <+Freckris> lol
[2022-12-30 14:04:12] <+Freckris> broke it
[2022-12-30 14:04:23] <+Freckris> oh, lol

[2022-12-30 14:04:38] <%Klarden> try the hospital and then the potential sick trick
[2022-12-30 14:04:42] <%Klarden> maybe it'll work this time
[2022-12-30 14:05:18] <+Freckris> lol, straight up off the bow
[2022-12-30 14:05:42] <CyanideCocoa> PauseChamp
[2022-12-30 14:05:51] <+Freckris> what does he MEAN both of us????
[2022-12-30 14:05:56] <Sky_Anon> thats sort of alt moist skip, but it doesn't really save any time over the original
[2022-12-30 14:06:12] <+mattatoullie182> he means.... AMOK-us
[2022-12-30 14:06:21] <+Freckris> lol

[2022-12-30 14:06:35] <%Klarden> seems like a part of the thing has "can step on" enabled, but not all of it
[2022-12-30 14:06:39] <+Thuradas> AMOK
[2022-12-30 14:06:43] <+Freckris> I think it triggered off the .... top hat?
[2022-12-30 14:06:50] <+Freckris> AYYY
[2022-12-30 14:06:52] <+Freckris> oop
[2022-12-30 14:07:00] <+Freckris> damn
[2022-12-30 14:07:13] <%Klarden> yeah, probably no "can step on" or a blocking volume on the right side
[2022-12-30 14:07:33] <llya7> sip
[2022-12-30 14:07:35] <Sky_Anon> The good ending
[2022-12-30 14:07:38] <+Freckris> invisible wall?
[2022-12-30 14:07:41] <%Klarden> I wonder if it has a kill plane
[2022-12-30 14:07:46] <llya7> he follow the coffin

[2022-12-30 14:08:31] <+Freckris> invisble BLOCK
[2022-12-30 14:08:36] <%Klarden> yeah, I'd put a blocking volume there too myself -_-

[2022-12-30 14:10:11] <+inteloutside79> what's the normal path without moist skip?
[2022-12-30 14:10:32] <CyanideCocoa> LUL
[2022-12-30 14:10:32] <%Klarden> (set Shooting Stars  to play as I watch)
[2022-12-30 14:10:37] VIEWERS: 667
[2022-12-30 14:10:48] <+Freckris> @inteloutside79 go under deck, get wheel, go to hospital halucination, go through engine room, place wheel, go up stairs
[2022-12-30 14:11:40] <+inteloutside79> @freckris ah, ok. thanks! so moist skip def saves a decent chunk
[2022-12-30 14:11:55] <%Klarden> rotate
[2022-12-30 14:12:08] <llya7> SPIN AMOK
[2022-12-30 14:12:10] <%Klarden> stationary AMOK turret

[2022-12-30 14:13:12] <+Freckris> @inteloutside79 about 5 seconds if you can get it to work
[2022-12-30 14:13:25] <%+YamaJuugo> i think the box was helping
[2022-12-30 14:14:37] <%Klarden> well you did find a potential cool trick, maybe it works after hospital
[2022-12-30 14:14:38] <+Freckris> WHEEL
[2022-12-30 14:14:38] VIEWERS: 637
[2022-12-30 14:14:46] <%+YamaJuugo> the only thing I was considering, after the hospital part you could try that rail drop you did
[2022-12-30 14:14:51] <%+YamaJuugo> and see if that skips that dialogue
[2022-12-30 14:15:15] <%+YamaJuugo> where you thought you skipped the dialogue down the stairs
[2022-12-30 14:15:20] <+Freckris> doing the moist skip and maybe triggering the last dialogue
[2022-12-30 14:15:47] <%+YamaJuugo> by no means am I glitch hunter lol, just a thought is all
[2022-12-30 14:16:01] <%Klarden> might as well

[2022-12-30 14:16:42] <@%^StreamElements> Moistcr1tikal has set up a $10,000 Prize for the fastest speedrun of Amok Runner. I will probably not take this seriously, but might as well check it out!
[2022-12-30 14:16:45] <%Klarden> lol
[2022-12-30 14:16:51] <%Klarden> no UI priority
[2022-12-30 14:16:57] <Katenkiokotsu> damn that's a nice bounty
[2022-12-30 14:17:01] <gracefulartorias> I love finding glitches just dont understand the mechanics behind it. like on fallen order I found a way to get the final boss out their arena and under the map
[2022-12-30 14:17:09] <+PrimeDarkseid> what if you open a note at the same time the trigger happen maybe
[2022-12-30 14:18:32] <%Klarden> I mean, most narrative games are scripted linearly (speaking from experience). It's just safer to do
[2022-12-30 14:18:39] VIEWERS: 654
[2022-12-30 14:19:22] <%+YamaJuugo> rip
[2022-12-30 14:19:24] <%Klarden> damn
[2022-12-30 14:19:27] <gracefulartorias> damn
[2022-12-30 14:19:48] <%Klarden> So strange that the action zone activates
[2022-12-30 14:19:49] <+PrimeDarkseid> there is probably a way you just need to find it
[2022-12-30 14:20:09] <%Klarden> I guess they scripted the AZ+animation and the script for the actual coffin dropping as parallel actions
[2022-12-30 14:20:10] <+irrationalwife> This game needs Eugene. all speed runs do
[2022-12-30 14:20:40] VIEWERS: 644
[2022-12-30 14:20:54] <satanicminnow1> Does it give you a checkpoint to reload from along with the quest update there?
[2022-12-30 14:21:55] <+irrationalwife> Eugene could break it
[2022-12-30 14:22:11] <%Klarden> yeah, I see it now. the dialogue is linearly connected to this whole sequence of - coffin drops - camera moves in first person - you jump
[2022-12-30 14:22:14] <ReaperSword> weirdly solid game despite it being so buggy
[2022-12-30 14:22:16] <+irrationalwife> YESSSSIRRRRR
[2022-12-30 14:22:19] <gracefulartorias> it is quite odd you can push it but nothing happens without dialogue
[2022-12-30 14:22:20] <%+YamaJuugo> AMOKING YESSSSIRRR

[2022-12-30 14:23:18] <+irrationalwife> dist did like 12 minutes and just kick flipped cars and said that it wasn't worth 10k to suffer through this
[2022-12-30 14:23:28] <%Klarden> rat :3
