[2023-01-01 01:21:57] <%nopeboats> lps def buffed
[2023-01-01 01:22:00] <%goldenknight22> or they nerfed armor maybe
[2023-01-01 01:22:10] <%Crawlern> ps was buffed
[2023-01-01 01:22:17] <%Crawlern> so was 556
[2023-01-01 01:22:20] <@%+jimmiedrum> you found that one guys hand

[2023-01-01 01:22:27] <%ogjoker88> I think it has to do with armor leveling has nothing to do with ammo buffing or nerfing
[2023-01-01 01:22:27] <%nopeboats> @goldenknight22 my armor has been pretty good with other stuff
[2023-01-01 01:22:28] <$ilikedisc710> too many cheetos over the keyboard
[2023-01-01 01:22:59] <babe_harris> maybe they changed the armor damage applied to rigs

[2023-01-01 01:30:28] <Guhree> New wipe and new map must be bringing in hella old and new copetition im assuming
[2023-01-01 01:30:29] <bozo_dubs_over> I managed to be within 2 feet of a 3 man team on shoreline TWICE, and didn't get spotted. They must have been the 3 blind mice.
[2023-01-01 01:30:42] <Sparkatron3512> the dammage model for npcs is also broken
[2023-01-01 01:31:09] <+scotian> desync?
[2023-01-01 01:31:11] <+quantum_cupcakes> he might have died right after you
[2023-01-01 01:31:13] <%Crawlern> Some weird stuff is going down
[2023-01-01 01:31:15] <%blackacres> he definitely got hit
[2023-01-01 01:31:20] <%blackacres> I thought you traded

[2023-01-01 01:32:11] <@%IGotBurgerz> Is the lag/dsync only on streets? I was having 0 issues on other maps like we had on Streets
[2023-01-01 01:32:22] <BxHaZe87> :/

[2023-01-01 01:32:34] <Sparkatron3512> @Gingy honestly. im not suprised. this shit happens anytime a wipe comes out. give it 2 weeks and they will fix it with the cost of loot spawns. typical bsg

[2023-01-01 02:02:20] <MADBONG420> streets is just completely garbage performance wise
[2023-01-01 02:02:33] <konabudz> must be the map size lagging out
[2023-01-01 02:02:55] <+NotEverSober> I love this map though, feels like an entirely different game. Just needs time for omptimization
[2023-01-01 02:03:00] <%+MicroBM96> Mainly notice it at the beginning of raids more than throughout, at least in my experience
[2023-01-01 02:03:01] <MADBONG420> something every other map is fine but streets is just wildly poop
[2023-01-01 02:03:10] <%+MicroBM96> but it's def possible it's ongoing throughout
[2023-01-01 02:03:23] <KBOperator> Already 27? Gingy be cracked
