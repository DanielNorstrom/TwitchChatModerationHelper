[2023-01-03 13:52:06] <%+warnerbruva> I think they‚Äôve nerfed the weight of icons heroes etc since the draft objective. Seeing a lot of teams starting with 5 or 6 gold cards for Chem and then making subs straight away
[2023-01-03 13:52:15] <iandw01> might snope

[2023-01-03 13:55:26] <+GazHobbis1991> They should allow like 3 position changes per draft or put the 96 pele in as a cam or cf option

[2023-01-03 14:13:21] <@%CaniSports> @Witchwalker70 been wanting to get him for a while now. Think he will be an insane Challanger GK once his U23 runs out
[2023-01-03 14:13:30] <@%AaronBrookes94> @Stranglehold_2 Easiest way to see is the pitch, no damage

[2023-01-03 14:47:02] <+ryanabraham103015> if i didnt want to defend i wouldnt be playing
[2023-01-03 14:47:02] <+Krautkopf8> The AI defense does not manage to deal with the step over speed boost though, ronaldo would have been gone ( at least on next gen)
[2023-01-03 14:47:04] <Sniekyy> yea AI interceptions have a way higher range instead of player controlled even though I remember them saying they changed it to it being player favorable
[2023-01-03 14:47:06] <zweback_muscular_legs> LUL LUL
[2023-01-03 14:47:06] <@%Viperlization> Going all the way across
[2023-01-03 14:47:09] <+sussussington> the game is trash....not up for debate
[2023-01-03 14:47:10] <+Matkinz> same it infuriates me that manual defending is so disgustingly bad compared to AI defending
[2023-01-03 14:47:14] <@%Viperlization> As soon as
[2023-01-03 14:47:15] <@%Viperlization> But he's slow
[2023-01-03 14:47:18] <+InsomniacNox> i believe when you are letting the AI  controls the defender it uses the defensive stats for interceptions but when you control it the game uses some nonsensical logic about if you get it or not
[2023-01-03 14:47:21] <@%Viperlization> So it's kinda irrelvant in draft
[2023-01-03 14:47:26] <taan02> Which is why I hate Manual defence. You HAVE TO only play with the DMs or if your lucky the Fullbacks
[2023-01-03 14:47:36] <+um4ry> still dont understand how people still play this game consistently. do moments like this not put them off completely? @NepentheZ
[2023-01-03 14:47:39] <$Dafifabomb> Wonder why Castro has stopped streaming fifa
[2023-01-03 14:47:43] <klan_h> First time using a left footed 5* skiller and can‚Äôt stand it, feels so weird having to do the reverse motion of a skill when it‚Äôs engrained with muscle memory
[2023-01-03 14:47:43] <+paddythemac777> game was alot better a week ago
[2023-01-03 14:47:46] <%+howdyitsdavid> yeah I overrun with my CBs constantly. I never play them. if the arrows over them to switch I have to resist the urge or I get killed.
[2023-01-03 14:47:48] <lozzerwhite360_> Do u play any other games other than fifa?
[2023-01-03 14:47:51] <supermercadotelebancos> The problem is, with manual defending there is a huge influence of rng. If you let the AI defend they will get it.
[2023-01-03 14:47:51] <taan02> Unless you got a CAM or CM that has 95+ stam you can control for most of the game
[2023-01-03 14:47:58] <%+anth0ny0rrell> theres a balance though, some times letting the ai defend is better and some times manual defending is better but the game is so illogical its almost impossible to figure out when to do which
[2023-01-03 14:47:59] <taan02> 90*
[2023-01-03 14:47:59] <@%Viperlization> yeah agree with that
[2023-01-03 14:48:04] <termoos890> of course it happens to me all the time i gotta start playing more boring
[2023-01-03 14:48:07] VIEWERS: 1¬†749
[2023-01-03 14:48:08] <+Matkinz> but the thing is its just crap is you don't play manual defending, you should be able to get rewarded for good defending. not just let the AI do it
[2023-01-03 14:48:08] <stylish_ninja99> yea true
[2023-01-03 14:48:22] <linus_teo> Yeah 100% from that frame you're not close enough but AI would 100% get it
[2023-01-03 14:48:25] <%+rbuckley98> if all interceptions we're awful AI or human controlled it'd be easier to comprehend
[2023-01-03 14:48:29] <%+anth0ny0rrell> this game rewards attacking but doesnt reward defending
[2023-01-03 14:48:35] <reaction_no814> Tune!
[2023-01-03 14:48:40] <+Matkinz> why not just make everything AI then you can just sit there and watch but you'll win atleast
[2023-01-03 14:48:41] <+knockoutned12> you know it's really bad when EA can't even fix Drogba World Cup Icon image face or body. If they are struggling with that then how can we be confident they can even work out gameplay bugs. To me it sounds like they prioritize game content and menus rather than developing a playable game to the true gamers who would rather have better gameplay than the cards
[2023-01-03 14:48:41] <@%Viperlization> I think you had a lot of opportunities with the pen calls
[2023-01-03 14:48:41] <RamiElmo> @anth0ny0rrell so true

[2023-01-03 14:48:49] <@%Viperlization> you get in that position so often, every game
[2023-01-03 14:49:04] <RamiElmo> loool
[2023-01-03 14:49:13] <deziixixv> remember when games had skill gaps instead of AI doing everything
[2023-01-03 14:49:14] <%+rbuckley98> feel like im thrown back to a 3am clubs break down session
[2023-01-03 14:49:16] <Sniekyy> whenever I control a player and I manually intercept the ball also bounces off back to the attacker way more instead of when its the AI automatically intercepting the ball
[2023-01-03 14:49:18] <+morr_123> just play the game instead of talking about the past mistakes
[2023-01-03 14:49:20] <%+howdyitsdavid> @knockoutned12 they cant even upgrade Nick Pope.
[2023-01-03 14:49:20] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> That is why people who just bang blind through balls get so many "lucky" passes
[2023-01-03 14:49:21] <+GazHobbis1991> I agree with you 100% nep, question though are you holding hockey with the manually controlled defender as that makes them less likely to intercept passes, that‚Äôs what I find anyway as it happens to me too
[2023-01-03 14:49:22] <@%Viperlization> Wait wait
[2023-01-03 14:49:24] <+mk7_jordan> as and when your defenders do mess up you can guarantee your GK will 100% do something stupid or just stand there
[2023-01-03 14:49:26] <@%Viperlization> hold that frame there
[2023-01-03 14:49:28] <Bret__> did you already record draft to glory?

[2023-01-03 14:49:57] <zweback_muscular_legs> ronaldo was mad that game
[2023-01-03 14:49:57] <+knockoutned12> @howdyitsdavid yeah it's really really bad. incompetence at this point
[2023-01-03 14:49:57] <+Ibra_fan_boy> I played against a guy who played 433 defend and had Reece Oxford at the CDM and genuinely only controlled him when he defended. It was the hardest game I‚Äôve played in a long time, so hard to break him down
[2023-01-03 14:50:07] VIEWERS: 1¬†749
[2023-01-03 14:50:08] <taan02> Yeah I think I see the game different to how the gameplay actually works. Playing basketball I see more passes before it happens. So I play passes hoping they run through onto it. But since the AI cant see that they play a pass that is 10x worst
[2023-01-03 14:50:10] <kevpies42> Passing is so unreliable
[2023-01-03 14:50:10] <bradnufc459> Its an AI defending game players who cant really defend get away with so much because of the help of AI defending
[2023-01-03 14:50:10] <thenoor123> thats EA nothing u can do mate
[2023-01-03 14:50:10] <zwieberrpwg> thats why people player lock tho
[2023-01-03 14:50:12] <gurubiggie7> is it old gen nep?
[2023-01-03 14:50:14] <+WeeManLewis> thing ive seen with the through balls this year is you really have to use the driven through ball to get accuracy even for short through balls
[2023-01-03 14:50:27] <%+howdyitsdavid> @Ibra_fan_boy thats exactly how I play, but with baby vieira in 433(2)
[2023-01-03 14:50:28] <@%Viperlization> Yeah I get you
[2023-01-03 14:50:33] <@%Viperlization> But you're good at player locks
[2023-01-03 14:50:40] <@%Viperlization> Very good at them from what I've seen
[2023-01-03 14:50:42] <%+anth0ny0rrell> passing is bad at the moment i feel like im going insane with some of the passes lol
[2023-01-03 14:50:50] <zweback_muscular_legs> LUL
[2023-01-03 14:50:52] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> That situation with Gullit is 100% what I was on about with put you back in the 70th minute. You dont try and fire that ball quickly. You would have taken a touch and made a better pass.
[2023-01-03 14:50:52] <+Matkinz> but how bullshit is that. People are getting rewarded for doing less work than someone doing more, ie manual defending
[2023-01-03 14:51:09] <+Simmy10mk> the amount of times my opponents Butra/Neymar/Ribery sticks there leg out and blocks a pass that is nowhere near the player yet my Vieira/Van dijk can't block a pass right next to them actually insane and its not a one off its countless times every game
[2023-01-03 14:51:15] <+tinolesurf> Does anyone know if you can go unassigned with cards like previous fifas??
[2023-01-03 14:51:16] <$punyay> best way to practise player locks viper?
[2023-01-03 14:51:21] <taan02> Nep at 38>>>>>> any other fifa player other then the Goat Bateson
[2023-01-03 14:51:25] <apickledgherkin> I need to deep heat my fingers before playing Fifa these days
[2023-01-03 14:51:31] <+um4ry> let it go nep, nothing will change unfortunately
[2023-01-03 14:51:31] <klan_h> @punyay just by trying them in game
[2023-01-03 14:51:35] <Sdevamdeva17> ea removed the dotted lines from replays so that people cant see where their initial pass was aimed at so that you cant prove that you passed it there
[2023-01-03 14:51:44] <nero_182> @apickledgherkin why
[2023-01-03 14:51:51] <+Simmy10mk> @sdevamdeva17 yep
[2023-01-03 14:51:51] <+knockoutned12> Nep I noticed you let the previous opponent come to you because he was depending on AI defending. I have found that at least 80% of my games are players just controlling their CMs and letting the AI play for them.

[2023-01-03 14:52:31] <%+howdyitsdavid> I cant listen to the game sounds anymore. I takes me out of focus and I lose composure. I have to mute it and listen to jazz when I play.
[2023-01-03 14:52:36] <RamiElmo> @Viperlization is player lock a viable option against better opposition ??
[2023-01-03 14:52:44] <%+anth0ny0rrell> cause aint that what the game will go off, which player is better not the skill of you vs who you playing
[2023-01-03 14:52:46] <momich___> he cant see him, he is off screen
[2023-01-03 14:52:57] <+knockoutned12> @howdyitsdavid haha true. I listen to Twitch
[2023-01-03 14:52:59] <%+JoshEFC90> Game was shocking the day it dropped. I thought Player select couldn‚Äôt get any worse than on fifa 22 but they managed it.
[2023-01-03 14:53:01] <bradnufc459> This game can be so bad sometimes its frustrating. so inconsistant
[2023-01-03 14:53:03] <@%Viperlization> I don't wanna keep pushing it, but the reason I'm saying player locks right, is everytime you do them, it makes the passes work EVERY time

[2023-01-03 14:53:45] <+WeeManLewis> your sticks aimed a bit out when you hit the through ball but still, telling you tho if you it a driven there it works

[2023-01-03 14:53:59] <+knockoutned12> @viperlization true 100%  I find myself player locking simple passes because I am not confident in EAs shocking gameplay
[2023-01-03 14:53:59] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> @rbuckley98 VR fifa coming soon
[2023-01-03 14:54:01] <Sdevamdeva17> @Simmy10mk i think if ea kept the dotted lines for passes in replays it would prove that the game doesnt consider your input from your controller when passing

[2023-01-03 14:54:03] <%m_silky> This might be an unpopular opinion but I really like this fifa and the gameplay but I don‚Äôt play as much as you so it don‚Äôt notice these things

[2023-01-03 15:10:36] <%$alfiemayisthegoat> Enzo in training today but seen a couple reports saying that him to Chelsea is a done deal

[2023-01-03 15:12:48] <%+howdyitsdavid> The craziest thing about the Enzo deal is River Plate gets 25%. Talk about good business. They're gonna get at least 25m from this sell on.

[2023-01-03 15:13:14] <%$alfiemayisthegoat> The difference in speed from Benfica between him and Nunez is insane, they wanted to sell Nunez as quickly as possible, but trying to take as much time as possible for Enzo, I think they knew they could milk Liverpool for so much more than Nunez was worth
[2023-01-03 15:13:49] <%+howdyitsdavid> @alfiemayisthegoat yeah that's just blatantly false.

[2023-01-03 15:42:59] <%+MackTominay> Only takes 30 secs to change the angle, will probably make that up with the amount of time you lose the ball/run it out of play on this awful angle

[2023-01-03 16:10:27] <mheasman> Would the market go down a lot when toty comes out?
[2023-01-03 16:10:30] <+HairyRaven> You might have to undercut a little on prices, just to ensure they sell fast, rather than waiting best part of the hour to get the sales.

[2023-01-03 17:22:47] <+rjallsopp> @whufcconnor yeah it's just mega time consuming. All rare bronzes sell for 250/300, along with Ligue 1 and Erdivisie common golds, rare bronzes and silvers. Made absolute bank. But I did have a few high rated untradeables already to throw into the 89 and 88 squads for Jairzinho so not quite from scratch. I like playing with untradeables personally so I don't have to deal with losing coins every week but that's just my weird anxiety over pretend coins LUL

[2023-01-03 17:25:04] <+rjallsopp> @whufcconnor I'm exactly the same. I do sink a lot into TOTY upgrades though, managed to pack Messi, Donna and Hakimi last year from about 500k invested then stopped playing the game in Feb LUL

[2023-01-03 17:36:45] <$xJDinvasion> Ronaldo should do what Suarez did with Atletico 20/21 season, put ego aside and proof everybody wrong

[2023-01-03 17:37:03] <matt__jame2> I‚Äôd love to agree on that‚Ä¶ but after his recent press I don‚Äôt think anyone would take him tbh..
[2023-01-03 17:37:03] <%+threefatslugs> MARCA put out a statement I believe, r/soccer has the details
[2023-01-03 17:37:03] <AbdelhamidT> ronaldo most hated and loved player of all time imo
[2023-01-03 17:37:04] <%+LukeOW96> @LukeOW96 He's obviously gonna get one in the future
[2023-01-03 17:37:05] <+SegaBoy1988> not at this age when newcastle are trying to get top 4 he can t do anything for them they need pace
[2023-01-03 17:37:09] <%+mikehkl1996> The Newcastle-thing started on some Saudi-Arabia twitter fan page and then the media picked it up
[2023-01-03 17:37:11] <billyasp28> hey nep how are you
[2023-01-03 17:37:12] <+ragingrhino48> Ronaldo isn‚Äôt a team players anymore, hence why he‚Äôs in Saudi Arabia. No one wants him
[2023-01-03 17:37:13] <kizFM> would've been a very clever way of getting around FFP for Newcastle if it *was* true though
[2023-01-03 17:37:17] <not_vaki> Ronaldo gonna be benched by Chris Wood LUL
[2023-01-03 17:37:18] <%+thescampi> Yes, better individual, but he‚Äôs not a better team player.

[2023-01-03 17:37:28] <bradnufc459> Ronaldo wouldn't suit our style of play with high press no chance
[2023-01-03 17:37:29] <+plantedwharf545> Howe would rather not disrupt the dressing room though surely? The owners would force him upon Howe
[2023-01-03 17:37:31] <+grem1983> Howe wouldn‚Äôt want Ronaldo, goes against everything he has said the last 12 months

[2023-01-03 17:37:40] <+rppatel7> ESPN said there is no new castle clause in CR7 contract.
[2023-01-03 17:37:44] <+SegaBoy1988> the bench is warmer in the saudi leauge than the north east

[2023-01-03 17:37:49] <%blazer33x> Because saudi is the minor leagues
[2023-01-03 17:37:49] <Dash_counter7> Newcastle line up is always the same except the striker, which means ronaldo can fit easily

[2023-01-03 17:38:22] <%+Gworv> who wanted him?
[2023-01-03 17:38:23] <ThmsHrpr> On current performances, Ronaldo is no longer a an elite player and demands way too much sacrifice from other aspects of the team to be able to succeed in a top European team now. IMO
[2023-01-03 17:38:24] <wrightyy1x> Do we get all rewards from the World Cup mode or only the level u finished on?
[2023-01-03 17:38:24] <%EitchBee> I think almost all CL clubs want him but they don't accept his wage demands at his age

[2023-01-03 17:38:27] <Da_kapo> United wanted him to stay

[2023-01-03 17:39:18] <yungmaseyy> I wouldn‚Äôt take him at Liverpool, I feel like his ethos just doesn‚Äôt fit. He‚Äôd definitely bang goals but it suddenly becomes Ronaldo FC wherever he goes, which is a toxic environment to be in if you play for that team.

[2023-01-03 17:39:48] <+rossd1987> Loads off teams wanted him . MLS that is Ronaldo has done so much for this sport why hate. When messi lost out on champions league years running it was actually Ronaldo that said he will bounce back . Soon as Ronaldo needs anyone they turn there back
[2023-01-03 17:39:50] <$CaptainIIama> I read somewhere that there's a clause in CR7's contract to join Newcastle in case they get champions league since they have the same owners? Not sure if cap
[2023-01-03 17:39:52] <%DeEeBoO_11> anyone hates on Ronaldo or Messi simply needs education

[2023-01-03 17:40:00] <%+joes_so_fine> some thickos in the world saying nobody wanted him, no they did, its his wages that put teams off

[2023-01-03 17:40:02] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> I think the problem with ronaldo is more that the cost is not worth the play you get.
[2023-01-03 17:40:11] <tkorsgaten> no UCL clubs wanted him
[2023-01-03 17:40:12] <saalund> NEP, its a lost cause tryin to school haters. They ONLY live to hate, and cant see just anything from another perspective.
[2023-01-03 17:40:14] <kizFM> i'd take him at hereford, ngl
[2023-01-03 17:40:18] <%+celtlc> The disrespect for the Saudi league is real lol, Just because its not Europe doesn't mean its a shit league
[2023-01-03 17:40:20] <OriginallyTom> Don‚Äôt think a CL team wanted him
[2023-01-03 17:40:30] <LukaTee> hes way too expensive
[2023-01-03 17:40:31] <+teasyy_tom> he said after that that no big club wanted him. he changed up more than a prozzie changes jobs lol
[2023-01-03 17:40:33] <%+gpnick7> and if we do get Europe, you need more options to cover the games it's  no brainer, and the branding it would do for Newcastle would be incredible so more future money to cover ffp
[2023-01-03 17:40:33] <stephen_kertis> @lukeow96 they're both goats... Messi is the better of the two but they both are
[2023-01-03 17:40:33] <%+fistyanan> probably meant it as in. nobody wanted him other than nassr
[2023-01-03 17:40:34] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> @tkorsgaten I reckon half the UCL clubs in the competiton would take him. Just not at half a mill a week
[2023-01-03 17:40:35] <dizzydukc> nep do you like grey goose?
[2023-01-03 17:40:35] <%+SportingMoose> @SpreadsheetFifa Would echo this. You are getting quite the value it would cost to bring CR7 in
[2023-01-03 17:40:37] <Da_kapo> People really think Ronaldo didn‚Äôt have loads of offers seriously? EleGiggle
[2023-01-03 17:40:38] <PsychoXVI> who debunked the ronaldo clause im a newcastle fan and i would take him if they could keep his ego in check
[2023-01-03 17:40:40] <+dangerveiw101> he should have added top... in the nobody
[2023-01-03 17:40:42] <+SegaBoy1988> Ronaldo would get less hate if he did not act like a child at 38 and more of a role model instead of throwing his toys out of the pram.
[2023-01-03 17:40:44] <not_vaki> all dead clubs
[2023-01-03 17:40:46] <moynul1995> i think its a new thing now hate  on cr7 like he was not top 3 players in the last 20 years

[2023-01-03 17:40:48] <AbdelhamidT> clubs couldnt pay him thats why

[2023-01-03 17:40:55] <+lukequeen18> He‚Äôs just been in a press conference and said he had offers from America Europe and Brazil
[2023-01-03 17:40:57] <%+thescampi> @saalund I don‚Äôt hate Ronaldo, just don‚Äôt think he makes my team (Newcastle) any better
[2023-01-03 17:40:57] <Mcr_xMaYheMx> he should of said nobody in europe wanted him in chams league
[2023-01-03 17:40:59] <kryp____> the thing clubs had to come to consideration is any club he joined, had to make him the main man. the saudi team wanted him, especially ones needing a striker
[2023-01-03 17:40:59] <+tonyyysnow> well none of the clubs that cr7 wanted to join, wanted him

[2023-01-03 17:41:06] <Dash_counter7> His salary as a 37 year old player is too expensive, thats the problem
[2023-01-03 17:41:09] <humpalumpa321> There we‚Äôre probably lots of clubs interessded in him but none were tempting as they didn‚Äôt play CL. So he chose money. I would‚Äôve too
[2023-01-03 17:41:10] <%$istreet98> People forget he's 38 and act like the last 18 years don't matter anymore
[2023-01-03 17:41:10] <+speedsterbr_> if you match his wage demands he represents poor value for money irrespective of his quality
[2023-01-03 17:41:11] <shebanimoad> I who do you think arsenal should sign next window
[2023-01-03 17:41:14] <saalund> Guys, a LOT of clubs from CL wanted him, just not at his Salary. And, hes 38, why the hell is it not fair to keep the salary as long as he can. EVERYBODY would do the same.
[2023-01-03 17:41:15] <%$Macenzi1> The hate on Ronaldo is a disgrace. Then they say Real Madrid don‚Äôt want him, Madrid are one of the best teams in the planet currently and have Benz as their ST the current Balon winner‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ these children are just idiots
[2023-01-03 17:41:16] <kevpies42> CR7 brought the hate himself to be honest. Anyone respectable doesnt bag club and manager in public before finishing up with club there contracted with
[2023-01-03 17:41:28] <+Tobyy91> to say no CL club would have took him is completely nonsensical
[2023-01-03 17:41:32] <not_vaki> they just wanted the fans

[2023-01-03 17:41:40] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> None of the clubs that CR7 wanted to join, and could afford his salary, and needed a striker wanted him. Absolutely. But that, in absolutely no way, is "nobody".

[2023-01-03 17:41:51] <+koby_32> Anyone see CR7 statement that his work is done in Europe? I think he‚Äôs just going to get his final bag so his children‚Äôs children have a good life
[2023-01-03 17:41:52] <kryp____> True, the main reason he was signed was for the 2030 World Cup bid
[2023-01-03 17:41:53] <%+Jack_Lacey2005> maguire starting for utd tonight nep
[2023-01-03 17:41:56] <+SegaBoy1988> And the fact Ronaldo himself said he did not want to be a player that went to america or china just shows not only is he a child but full of it i lost a lot of respect for him as a person not a footballer
[2023-01-03 17:42:06] <+Neeks_Z> I‚Äôm pretty sure talisca is the leading goal scorer in the Saudi league too
[2023-01-03 17:42:09] <humpalumpa321> There we‚Äôre probably lots of clubs interessded in him but none were tempting as they didn‚Äôt play CL. So he chose money. I would‚Äôve too

[2023-01-03 17:42:33] <%+mattw_uk_99> The problem with Ronaldo is individually he's probably better than whatever striker he's replacing, but collectively he overall team performance is hurt if he can't fit into the team/won't press/throws tantrums
[2023-01-03 17:42:34] <%AHumanAlien> @iamthesnitch59 He would not fit Howe's tactics so not sure he goes there

[2023-01-03 17:42:46] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> City would fall under the obvious caveat of "dont want him"
[2023-01-03 17:42:47] <ThmsHrpr> I would love to see CR7 back to a great level for the twilight of his career but I think he's personally struggling to come to terms with his body and mind not being as sharp as it's been in the past. Add into that, the fact that until the last 12 months he's been the best player in every single professional team, it must be very hard for him internally.
[2023-01-03 17:42:47] <+grem1983> The fact is the clubs Ronaldo would be willing to sign for didn‚Äôt want him
[2023-01-03 17:42:47] <+FBSLeo> Im sorry but after everything hes said and the standards he himself had set, going to the saudi league is a failure
[2023-01-03 17:42:47] <humpalumpa321> There we‚Äôre probably lots of clubs interessded in him but none were tempting as they didn‚Äôt play CL. So he chose money. I would‚Äôve too.

[2023-01-03 17:45:16] <matt__jame2> He gave him word to a 200m contract hahaha

[2023-01-03 17:45:30] <+riddlr98> obviously people meant top tier clubs didnt want him nep
[2023-01-03 17:45:34] <+spursykid09> ronaldo lying like a mofo
[2023-01-03 17:45:34] <%+Metcalfe11> hes just not been playing consistent enough to properly produce results we all expect. he was producing in the worst United team in a long time. but to change united they needed something ronaldo can give anymore because of his age which is energy
[2023-01-03 17:45:34] <vibesfc_> @segaboy1988 So Messi wasn't a goat 3 months ago? Logic is so flawed
[2023-01-03 17:45:34] <matt__jame2> What he‚Äôs saying is‚Ä¶ everyone wanted me but I chose the money lol

[2023-01-03 17:45:37] <not_vaki> Ronaldo is finished and lets move on
[2023-01-03 17:45:38] <slurmywords> Hes getting 200m. Nice PR
[2023-01-03 17:45:38] <%+LukeOW96> He chose money, simple
[2023-01-03 17:45:38] <%+SportingMoose> Even my team in Midwest USA was reported to have negotiated with Ronaldo. So to say nobody wanted him is super farfetched
[2023-01-03 17:45:38] <tkorsgaten> why on earth would he prefer saudi league?
[2023-01-03 17:45:42] <+d_endo_> Now here comes the "HE MOVED FOR THE MONEY" bozos

[2023-01-03 17:45:43] <humpalumpa321> I think probably lots of top clubs wanted him, but  his salary was to big. You could then say if he really wanted to play CL he could‚Äôve lowered his salary as he is not really in need of money
[2023-01-03 17:45:48] <%m3elv1n> who wouldnt say yes to 200 mil

[2023-01-03 17:45:51] <stennnnnnnnnnnnnnnn> remember when Ronaldo said that xavis opinion doesn't matter because he player in qatar

[2023-01-03 17:46:58] <%+Rhysmead1> The style of play he suits isn‚Äôt used as much by a lot of the top teams, a lot of teams press from the front where as he‚Äôs a not that type of player, think he‚Äôs seen an opportunity to promote his image (with a very lucrative contract) at Al nassr, seems more like a financially driven decision than anything else which at his age you can‚Äôt complain about
[2023-01-03 17:46:58] <+SegaBoy1988> @suraj672004 no not till he got the world cup what don t you get. like calling a ufc fighter a goat but they never won the title

[2023-01-03 17:47:36] <+riddlr98> it was the only place that would pay him anything decent, hes not worth his demand anymore
[2023-01-03 17:47:36] <Brawnaldo> are the league sbcs worth it or should you just sell the players?
[2023-01-03 17:47:37] <vibesfc_> @suraj672004 Not you the other guy who clearly knows he's fumbled. I asked him if Messi was a goat before his world cup win and he's been silent

[2023-01-03 17:48:21] <%+joes_so_fine> Ronaldo with his Jumping, his ariel Prowess, his pace (still) might not be as quick as he was but hes still quick and powerful, can still do it at a top level

[2023-01-03 17:48:37] <m4nny1403> Messi fans lol
[2023-01-03 17:48:37] <+FBSLeo> messi was also money hungry

[2023-01-03 17:48:39] <kevpies42> He only struggled this year cause interrupted pre season
[2023-01-03 17:48:44] <%blazer33x> Even Portugal didn‚Äôt start him

[2023-01-03 17:48:46] <%+Jack_Lacey2005> to think about what ronaldo went through too. would mess up any player
[2023-01-03 17:48:46] <pmk03> futchamps reward update bro
[2023-01-03 17:48:47] <yungmaseyy> His off-pitch antics have people questioning his physical abilities which is wrong
[2023-01-03 17:48:47] <+SegaBoy1988> ok if ronaldo ain t finished zlatan ain t finished either
[2023-01-03 17:48:48] <%+sovereignsaint> I think different people have different motivations and goals. you'd think tho with Ronaldo that his would be sporting driven, rather than financial, given how minted he is already. think he could still do a good job in the Portugal league.

[2023-01-03 17:49:04] <humpalumpa321> I think probably lots of top clubs wanted him, but  his salary was to big. You could then say if he really wanted to play CL he could‚Äôve lowered his salary as he is not really in need of money, but I would‚Äôve probably chose money as well

[2023-01-03 17:49:07] <+footyrulez> Anyone that‚Äôs doubting his ability at top level is crazy imo, just didn‚Äôt work out to stay at United I reckon 90% of teams in top 5 leagues would accept him and play him
[2023-01-03 17:49:09] <%+nickblandmcfc> messi is clear untill big erling retires

[2023-01-03 17:49:14] <%+sheriffshinetop> Agree with your overall take Nep, but anyonw who watched United regularly will tell you we were a far worse team with Ronaldo in it

[2023-01-03 17:49:33] <+fifaant98> To me it wasn‚Äôt the talent that swayed Ronny away from united.  It was the fact that united were winning with Ronny on the bench and he wasn‚Äôt happy about it. Team game, Ten Hag stood his ground. Ronny is a great player, teammate not so much

[2023-01-03 17:49:52] <+SegaBoy1988> @vibesfc_  no he was not till he got the cup do you call a ufc fighter a goat if they never win a title
[2023-01-03 17:49:52] <the_curly_ace> Ronaldo at 37 was scoring just less goals than a prime salah in the premier league with the worst United team in 15 years. Messi is succeeding with Neymar and upcoming ballon D‚Äôor winning mbappe
[2023-01-03 17:49:56] <+Remizzle> only 1 who completed all things in football and thats messi
[2023-01-03 17:49:56] <%+thewalshman> I can tell
[2023-01-03 17:49:56] <%+YaBoyBussey> its like the nfl with tom brady, for years people said he was due to drop off and the next year hes due to drop off but he just kept going and improving, ronaldo can still do it a high level because he is motivated in the right and competitive way
[2023-01-03 17:49:59] <deziixixv> messi for agentina just stood around waiting to score
[2023-01-03 17:49:59] <provoke313> ronaldo is a beast. 37 yr old. who tf has done it at that age. other than messi. ronaldo will go down in history as one of the greats to ever played the beautiful game.
[2023-01-03 17:50:01] <%kuningasjari> there were also people 6 months ago that said he was finished. there were also people saying he was finished when he was in his prime.

[2023-01-03 17:50:24] <kryp____> Ronaldo is so smart, he understands he is slowing down so takes the money. In 2-3 years Messi will probably go and take a fat check in the MLS
[2023-01-03 17:50:24] <%AHumanAlien> To be honest I'm bored of CR7 vs Messi. Why can' we just enjoy two great footballers at the same time. Football tribalism is weird sometimes.

[2023-01-03 17:50:49] <+Quinniversal> Not to take anything away from Messi's talent/success, but you have to admit Messi was in the right place at the right time for most of his career. If CR7 started and stayed at Madrid for his whole career he'd have even crazier stats.

[2023-01-03 18:54:45] <+BawzSco> typical EA giving the worst packs as tradable.. I've done the premium SBC about 30 times and it has not been worthwhile...
[2023-01-03 18:54:46] <m4nny1403> Hopefully token to boost bpm today ea
[2023-01-03 18:54:47] <%+bneto10> Nep, with 3 limited, is it better to play undergod or kickoff on sorare?
[2023-01-03 18:54:58] <masatex7> Why not save packs for TOTY?

[2023-01-03 18:55:13] <%Madrushxbl> without totw in packs i think you miss out on a few discard totws losing you maybe 30k
[2023-01-03 18:55:14] <+euiess> @bawzsco same I didn‚Äôt even get 1 walkout and did them 5 times the premium one

[2023-01-03 18:56:15] <wolv3r1n3n> WizKid it's easier in general even to do SBC

[2023-01-03 18:56:47] <wolv3r1n3n> hello nep your coins are very low
[2023-01-03 18:56:48] <morganjones009> When to start pack saving for toty
[2023-01-03 18:56:50] <+sprynxf_> What do you think of the new champ rewards
[2023-01-03 18:56:54] <PhantomTucker45> not worth it imo
[2023-01-03 18:56:54] <linus_teo> @linus_teo which means its not a reliable way to complete sbcs
[2023-01-03 18:56:57] <+Sleepy_Albs> now in 4 minutes you have a new draft token
[2023-01-03 18:56:57] <@%Viperlization> you need to have a MASSIVE coin balance
[2023-01-03 18:57:00] <%+jsarrami> that south American silver SBC is a 20k sbc
[2023-01-03 18:57:00] <+Jeeves14> Speediest way to do this is on web app anyway but I get that doesn't make good streaming content
[2023-01-03 18:57:00] <%+whltemagnum> is it possible to fail the speedrun? or do you not see it like that?
[2023-01-03 18:57:02] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> @KareemTarek15 It literally costs less that 200k to complete 5 times

[2023-01-03 18:57:13] <Bennyisanidiottt> Neppo do draft token sbc and do draft and quick match for tradable packs
[2023-01-03 18:57:14] <SirVilgaudas> do some 78*3
[2023-01-03 18:57:15] <+Jz_Ben> the premium one is good for some pack stocking if your club is kind of full atm and supplement it with bpm
[2023-01-03 18:57:16] <@%+DavidMNobrega> You can do the premium SBC over and over again and maintain coins, I've done it 180 times
[2023-01-03 18:57:16] <frhnakif16> i agree
[2023-01-03 18:57:17] <jhahi99> its an RNG challenge isnt it, depends on pack luck
[2023-01-03 18:57:17] <%therealcathal> @linus_teo @linus_teo if you dont open packs, you cant get players
[2023-01-03 18:57:18] <%Madrushxbl> youre missing out on silvers from the bronze upgrade i think

[2023-01-03 18:57:26] <ryanfack> draft
[2023-01-03 18:57:26] <%+saaj003> it was worth it for me with loads of BPM but even then I did have to spend for the Ligue 1 and Lib 1 club squads. Did each 5 times for about 50k net loss via BPM
[2023-01-03 18:57:27] <@%+DavidMNobrega> You need to know what you're doing, I worked it all out
[2023-01-03 18:57:33] <%+fistyanan> @Jacob___Lodge not unlucky, reality with league sbcs

[2023-01-03 18:58:19] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> BPM, keep what you need to make it as free as possible, sell major leagues and rares etc. Its a very different way of grinding it and could be good for the videop
[2023-01-03 18:58:20] <+GeorgeAWC> @nepenthez are the advanced sbcs cheap enough for you to do it

[2023-01-03 19:03:36] <jdutz123> The ones that disagree are the ones that won't pack 5 84s
[2023-01-03 19:03:37] <paddypjc1986> it's nearly the same requirements as the 81+ if pack
[2023-01-03 19:03:37] <+dandriscoll7> so
[2023-01-03 19:03:38] <sjo89> it's actually fine
[2023-01-03 19:03:38] <+xxMillhouse> Id do it, but since my pack luck has been awful since WC started, nope
[2023-01-03 19:03:39] <%+ace2ey> it's awful
[2023-01-03 19:03:40] <AverageWaterEnjoyer1> bad value but we're still all gonna do it aren't we?
[2023-01-03 19:03:40] <%+saaj003> when you put it like that, 20k for 5 84+, that doesn't sound bad?
[2023-01-03 19:03:44] <%+Lescs04> can be recycled tho
[2023-01-03 19:03:44] <foscosicario> pepe ww
[2023-01-03 19:03:44] <Creativename_> If 84s are 4K which they usually are, you break even lol

[2023-01-03 19:08:19] <SirVilgaudas> great sbc especially since you have no where to put duplicates 84 from 78*3
[2023-01-03 19:08:21] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> But 20k of that is TOTW that lots of people have lying about untradeable in their club. I dont think its a bad exchange if you have it untradeable.
[2023-01-03 19:08:23] <hamza_a97> it's a low risk nep that's why
[2023-01-03 19:08:24] <baseythetank> most people have low informs in there club so I think the 5x84 is decent value
[2023-01-03 19:08:25] <+jayden_joshua21> I‚Äôll do it and hold for TOTY
