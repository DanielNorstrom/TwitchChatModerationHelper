[2023-01-10 17:49:08] <%Nosch> Min maxing coffee is basically getting a cheap grinder and some sort of pour over method like chemex or hario v60 and a basic kettle. In my opinion the biggest difference in taste is grinding the beans fresh. Then again any type of coffee is welcome and gate keeping taste is weirdchamp anyway
