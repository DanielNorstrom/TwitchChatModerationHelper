[2022-12-22 18:44:49] <+Taj_Maballs> MOA is not measured in diameter, though- its always degrees off of the point of aim. so a 1 MOA gun can be an inch off in either direction at 100y
[2022-12-22 18:44:56] <TakticalPickles> pretty sure MOA in tarkov is radius not diameter, so 1moa will shoot a 2 inch group in game

[2022-12-22 18:45:08] <t3aturtl3> diameter doesn't even make any sense, you just measure your distance from target
