[2023-01-03 08:34:25] <%LordOverflow> And I bet the game itself looks nothing like the ad :D
[2023-01-03 08:34:40] <!%armandharmes> it's a building mechanic where you need to take tuf descision, and if you fail... that the end
[2023-01-03 08:34:43] <%LordOverflow> You need to keep the reactor alive
[2023-01-03 08:34:54] <!%armandharmes> yes
[2023-01-03 08:35:09] <%+baco84> i would say the hardest building i played so far

[2023-01-03 14:20:08] <patri_patri> mech deathrattle is best/leapers
[2023-01-03 14:20:13] <%tudoricc> it s up for debate..i mean I don t likenit either but it can help with quests

[2023-01-03 14:22:14] <+kelvasco> every time you play 4 beasts or quill you discover, repeats each time. lamps is great with beasts or scam pirates though

[2023-01-03 14:55:22] <+gasrol> good idea
[2023-01-03 14:55:24] <+kelvasco> getting rid of croc might be better, coiler can load in more beasts

[2023-01-03 14:58:26] <+kelvasco> unbeatable play is now to taunt the sewer rat and swap a croc for another rat
[2023-01-03 14:58:29] <%+Its__Arkz> Change the croc for a rat pack
[2023-01-03 14:58:41] <%+Its__Arkz> Or another sewer rat

[2023-01-03 15:13:14] <patri_patri> Volatile is very strong if you have both mechs and beasts, with snek and stuff
[2023-01-03 15:13:53] <patri_patri> It's very versatile, you will see

[2023-01-03 15:14:48] <+kelvasco> sack + golden brann can be great
[2023-01-03 15:14:56] <SenorGrafton> provided you haven't golded the battlecry

[2023-01-03 15:16:48] <+kelvasco> murloc board + swolfin would be great mid game here
[2023-01-03 15:16:57] <+pfashizzle> that swolefin can get pretty big by doing that
