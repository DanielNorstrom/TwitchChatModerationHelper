[2023-01-05 12:29:46] <+crotzer2010> Torres at Chelsea????
[2023-01-05 12:29:47] <+wesslender> Nunez 100% should be in their he has a crazy chance conversion rate for a 80m striker
[2023-01-05 12:29:48] <jayjay17161> lukaku really should be here he has the highest total tranfer sum
[2023-01-05 12:29:48] <@%harvino1> as a chelsea fan im happy to replace nunez with lukaku !!!!
[2023-01-05 12:29:51] <!%m3elv1n> centurion nunez for 100 BCM

[2023-01-05 12:31:45] <%+mjphippzy> so whats grealish done in your eyes that doesn't make him a flop?
[2023-01-05 12:31:46] <%jackyfishyyy> no

[2023-01-05 12:32:15] <%greenpeppergoat> 2 assists in ten  games?
[2023-01-05 12:32:19] <%dannyvdzande1> Sorry but why is renato sanches in there? hes been injured for 3 motnhs
[2023-01-05 12:32:23] <%+kingnovakin> grealiosh hasn't lived up to price tag
[2023-01-05 12:32:26] <xe97x> he has 9 G/A for city in the poem in 36 games. that's poor
[2023-01-05 12:32:26] <jayjay17161> mate he assists haaland in the best offensive team this season
[2023-01-05 12:32:30] <%lfc_777> @crotzer2010 hes injured
[2023-01-05 12:32:31] <LjLavishh> Reason for putting sancho in squad?

[2023-01-05 12:32:55] <+f1_mercedes> Grealish in terms of some performance it’s bad everyone just looks at his price tag and g/a
[2023-01-05 12:33:01] <%Kevofx> Nunez has squandered so many chances over the last couple of games
[2023-01-05 12:33:03] <+00_SW33TCHiiNMUSiiC__> Like someone said earlier, Sancho has more goals and assists than Grealish

[2023-01-05 13:18:49] <%TheFifaFinisher> @ixi_nic_ixi Nunez is on the bench far right
[2023-01-05 13:18:49] <xxtejkyxx> van de beek or pamavinga

[2023-01-05 13:19:02] <!%Merk708> He’s hardly played
[2023-01-05 13:19:05] <NoxyJC> How’s he a flop? Not had a chance at city
[2023-01-05 13:19:08] <%mitchszyd> Nahhhhhhhhhh got be Naby.
[2023-01-05 13:19:11] <cheechnchong84> is mascherano best at cb or cdm
[2023-01-05 13:19:13] <%bluehobbs> He’s only been fit for about 4 games. Injured
[2023-01-05 13:19:13] <inhousechef> how can you call him a flop? he moved from leeds to city which is a major step up, he wasn’t in his fittest state but that’s not being a flop

[2023-01-05 13:19:30] <%jorenrenders> Im da biggest birdd
[2023-01-05 13:19:31] <inhousechef> disagree
[2023-01-05 13:19:31] <+saulyp4> hasn't he been injured though?
[2023-01-05 13:19:31] <%TheFifaFinisher> So hes like Jadon Sancho?

[2023-01-05 13:19:34] <%+JoeHarding91> disagree, been unlucky with injury
[2023-01-05 13:19:34] <!%Merk708> He was injured with a shoulder issue
[2023-01-05 13:19:35] <+Willba_00> Do you think ibra is getting a centrion?

[2023-01-05 13:19:46] <callumxsr> he now weighs more than he earns LUL
[2023-01-05 13:19:47] <%+HarryBCFC1875> I disagree with Phillips personally
[2023-01-05 13:19:48] <%+mensgold> put on too much weight and pep saying hes not trying much at training
[2023-01-05 13:19:48] <%+eagantjeee> thats city bench the most players are 50mill
[2023-01-05 13:19:48] <+theeelegendhimself> He has been very poor
[2023-01-05 13:19:49] <%bluehobbs> He has
[2023-01-05 13:19:50] <mah1920> also cammavinga
[2023-01-05 13:19:51] <%mitchszyd> How much did Naby cost? I think he's had more time to perform and has been appalling!
[2023-01-05 13:19:54] <archwestpowell> GREENWOOD IS GAY
[2023-01-05 13:19:54] <inhousechef> he needs time to suit man city style plus he has players way better ahead of him - i never think he was brought in to be a first team player
[2023-01-05 13:19:54] <+theeelegendhimself> when he played he looked bad
[2023-01-05 13:19:55] <%+steeel93> he was never getting time behind rodri
[2023-01-05 13:19:55] <%jackyfishyyy> well we could say ronaldo
