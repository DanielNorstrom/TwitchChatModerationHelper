[2022-12-29 14:26:11] <%Subtle_D> @KangaRoobit yeah that my dilemma ... but the sales because am5 came out are soooo good. :P
[2022-12-29 14:26:35] <%Subtle_D> none of the current am5 ones near the price of the r9 5900xt are close in specs really

[2022-12-29 14:29:04] <TheBubuBear> @Subtle_D yea for now, current gen prices are through the roof, imo if u found that cpu on a discount with the mobo, get it. Ofc its better to get current gen, but it depends if the extra cost is worth it for you
[2022-12-29 14:29:06] <%Subtle_D> @Heyhowsitgoingtonight LUL in a perfect world...im looking for the sweet deals though bro

[2022-12-29 14:29:43] <%Subtle_D> @TheBubuBear @KangaRoobit i made this cpu last near a decade... so i think grabbing the am4 on sale is probably the way to go for me

[2022-12-29 15:44:51] <@%$Everleigh> Yes @TheBubuBear !
[2022-12-29 15:45:01] <+DoktorNik> So there are two types of animals for overworld travel "Pack animals" and "Speed Increasing" aka mounts. Horses by default increase the distance you can move on the overworld, and animals such as donkeys reduce the weight burden when you travel.   There is a great mod called Giddy-up that adds in actual mounts on the colony maps.

[2022-12-29 18:59:28] <%+RhedZirus> the game starts in 5 mins, the playing however....
[2022-12-29 18:59:35] <%trivialmind> Can confirm. Some people are still in the character creator.
[2022-12-29 18:59:43] <$CapnSlipp> I guess I don’t mind the 500% difficulty runs when they also are doing weird scenarios that can involve serious cheese.  Like ice sheet— most of the raiders you get will just freeze to death.
[2022-12-29 19:00:11] <%manu_forti> many games I've started when i spent more time setting it up than actually playing

[2022-12-29 19:02:49] <%itssalsashark> It's one thing to ask for a recap, it's another to try and be subtle about backseating a streamer by telling them how much more fun they COULD be having if only they played the game more like _I_ like to play
[2022-12-29 19:02:53] <scarecrow3101> I think it rude to ask what a person difficulty directly...I agree with the @cringer

[2022-12-29 19:04:34] <+oldgianni> first time here. first question is: how much fun is this game and which dlc should i get? (can't get them all)
[2022-12-29 19:04:46] <%$Liam121abc> what is the worse coment u got in chat in 2022 Cringer but u gave your Response.
[2022-12-29 19:04:46] <+leadtooth> @oldgianni biotech by FAR
[2022-12-29 19:04:50] <Selmephren> How modded or vanilla is a better question I would think.
[2022-12-29 19:05:01] <%itssalsashark> I went to see Lewis Black a few years ago. He started the show by explaining some people were probably in the audience that just bought tickets, thinking it'd be a nice night out, and had no idea what kind of comedian he was. Took three jokes before a couple up front got up and left :)
[2022-12-29 19:05:05] <%cubion> wait you mean there other streams so i been here all this time watch you think your the only one but burke to keep me company till you get one

[2022-12-29 19:05:33] <@%$Everleigh> Biotech for sure, if you can only pick one.
[2022-12-29 19:06:02] <scarecrow3101> I would say royalty last pick for dlc...

[2022-12-29 19:13:57] <%+jeecktoo> @kelen49 dwarf fortess is much larger in scope. you're more making a city than a small colony
[2022-12-29 19:14:06] <$CapnSlipp> @kelen49 A little more tantrumy, but a little less 3D.
[2022-12-29 19:15:01] <%+jeecktoo> @kelen49 also much more open ended than rimworld. rimword's much better at telling the story right to you, while with dwarf fortress you gotta do a bit of digging around and interpreting for the story it tells
