[2022-12-21 16:16:17] <badsector32> @Jenazad s3 deals 80% dmg of injury not detonate.
[2022-12-21 16:16:21] <%AuKi39> s3 don't detonate venom. he detonates injueries
[2022-12-21 16:16:21] <+GenesisFR> Too poor for a ML5
[2022-12-21 16:16:23] <%AuKi39> danHmm
[2022-12-21 16:16:25] <ThirteenLantern> doesn't s1 detonates venom?
[2022-12-21 16:16:26] <iStalkCheese> maybe if his S1 was extra turn sb
[2022-12-21 16:16:26] <theconfirmed> s1 detonates
[2022-12-21 16:16:26] <sufferingfromaya> feels cope
[2022-12-21 16:16:26] <Kombonk> This is a non-attack skill?
[2022-12-21 16:16:27] <Tig3rKnee> yeah but would he work fast enough against evasion units
[2022-12-21 16:16:29] <mehboizz> i think there is finally a real counter to aravi guys

[2022-12-21 16:16:34] <Wave_Jaeger> If it takes 4 turns to S3, his S3 should remove all buffs too
[2022-12-21 16:16:38] <griffinslim> counter set like ameru?
[2022-12-21 16:16:39] <%+WildNeptune> is denotating injury that good if they are injured enough to have no HP anyway?

[2022-12-21 16:39:55] <%+CayoticsYT> You don't beed to justify picking a character i think, if you see a time where you can then why not, you don't have to go for the best option, sometimes you just want to go for the fun option and the fun option can be one that is like ml ray
[2022-12-21 16:39:58] <+Luardzz> jena the one match u lost, ml ray wud have rolled, if thats not a reason to roll i dont know what is Kappa

[2022-12-21 16:47:19] <+Luardzz> the problem is that he have to rely on team mates to place the venoms
[2022-12-21 16:47:19] <THEKILLERBEE25> Yeah but it's 2 turns and venom deals 10% for 1 turn
[2022-12-21 16:47:25] <tundranocaps> Well, he solves the issues Sharun had by having detonation.
[2022-12-21 16:47:29] <%+Sarris_Wolf> Wouldnt it be 120% since 6 venom each but its 2 turns
[2022-12-21 16:47:32] <%kashirosan> You connot go below 50% max health as injurie tho. Right ?
[2022-12-21 16:47:35] <sayoritenshi> cant wait for them to buff him in the february balance patch
[2022-12-21 16:47:35] <polosso> This man is garbage until a Venom artifact or a new venom unit pops up
[2022-12-21 16:47:37] <%+zed37666> so if you injure something to max that is 50% hp then he deals 80% of that 50%
[2022-12-21 16:47:39] <tundranocaps> @kashirosan Yup.
[2022-12-21 16:47:40] <+watsonBG> imagine all characters that strives on eff, with the eff buff, plus venom stacks, then he detonates, kaboom

[2022-12-21 16:48:15] <tundranocaps> He can kill units, unlike Sharun, by detonating.
[2022-12-21 16:48:16] <THEKILLERBEE25> Delibet is on permaban if you're running him OMEGALUL
[2022-12-21 16:48:17] <lemonboxed> cloud of death is the funniest s3 name
[2022-12-21 16:48:23] <gameplayer38706> if they buff him ima laugh no cap im pulling his ass
[2022-12-21 16:48:27] <jesus_christ_themessiah> didnt he give pestilence buff to team so his team can inflict venom for him??
[2022-12-21 16:48:27] <shadowbreaker__> Dilibet is good yeah
[2022-12-21 16:48:27] <JBorgs19> im pulling regardless cuz thats my boy. kinda like what i did with aelena too BASEDHALT
[2022-12-21 16:48:30] <+eman12399> Yeah at 50% it’s just poison
[2022-12-21 16:48:31] <%+zed37666> What if you build him with some atk then Lua artifact puts him in stealth?
[2022-12-21 16:48:33] <Holystea> it doesnt detonate
[2022-12-21 16:48:38] <vrozeus> dont he popped the choux in showcase?
[2022-12-21 16:48:38] <Holystea> on s3
[2022-12-21 16:48:39] <morrseh> @THEKILLERBEE25 dilibet only reduce 1 turn not cleanse
[2022-12-21 16:48:43] <%Tantfant> i'll not all in like i did with ml elena this time ok i Waiting this time
[2022-12-21 16:48:45] <+Adelanjor> if you can't kill units wit 10% hp left you deserve to lose tho
[2022-12-21 16:48:50] <+katicflis> I mean he popped two units in the vid
[2022-12-21 16:48:50] <tundranocaps> His S3 leaves them at 10%, then his S1 detonation kills them @Jenazad
[2022-12-21 16:48:52] <%+KosmicXIII> !song
[2022-12-21 16:48:52] <%+Snipeglider> If target is at 80% of total HP, then it kill from 50% total injury
[2022-12-21 16:48:52] <lHuskyy> max injury is 50% of total hp, and he detonates 80% of that 50%, so they survive
[2022-12-21 16:48:53] <lemonboxed> ray is detonating the what
[2022-12-21 16:48:53] <+Nauqeas> I guess look at him like a support and not a main dps ..?
[2022-12-21 16:48:55] <AlzasRegius> hmm yea it is, that kinda suck i kinda like his art
[2022-12-21 16:48:56] <%+konayuki1994> @zed37666 he's soul weaver, lua is an archer
[2022-12-21 16:48:56] <lu2doe> i mean, if they're at max injury, chances are they're not at max hp (50%)
[2022-12-21 16:48:56] <%kashirosan> So if you don't apply both venom you don't kill if they full of current health and max injury XD
[2022-12-21 16:48:59] <just303030> maybe we need more poison units
[2022-12-21 16:49:04] <!%Cooowop> lacDank
[2022-12-21 16:49:04] <+Luardzz> he needs a few venoms on his target already and then s3 then it will kill
[2022-12-21 16:49:05] <+eman12399> He’s too slow a unit to work. They should of given him pestilence so that those 2 turns could matter
[2022-12-21 16:49:07] <kono_jio> OMEGALUL
[2022-12-21 16:49:11] <backspace999> @jenazad Lua debuffs are jst better than his LUL
[2022-12-21 16:49:16] <lHuskyy> that venom is decoration KEKW
[2022-12-21 16:49:16] <THEKILLERBEE25> @morrseh oh right i forget, she's pretty much permabanned for me
[2022-12-21 16:49:23] <+Luardzz> the fact that he cant place his owns venoms just makes him bad
[2022-12-21 16:49:24] <!%Cooowop> HandGuy
[2022-12-21 16:49:27] <shadowbreaker__> need another venom BOOBA LUL
[2022-12-21 16:49:31] <skyes_s> HandGuy
[2022-12-21 16:49:36] <%Ramsir> Idk, what's the problem with him not killing with this? You have 3 other units, if he weakens the other team enough can't you just finish them off with someone else?
[2022-12-21 16:49:38] <ChotoMatte> also momo probably counters him so hard with infinite S2 ICANT

[2022-12-21 16:50:53] <%+KosmicXIII> !songlist
[2022-12-21 16:50:54] <ChotoMatte> 2 turns is 20% health i guess?
[2022-12-21 16:50:54] <^Nightbot> @KosmicXIII -> The song list for this channel is available at https://nightbot.tv/t/jenazad/song_requests
[2022-12-21 16:50:54] <%+CayoticsYT> so that is 2 turns of venom detonated
[2022-12-21 16:51:05] <nyxxlul> he detonates immediately after s3 i guess
[2022-12-21 16:51:08] <%+CayoticsYT> so yea that is 2 venoms separate venoms
[2022-12-21 16:51:08] <+Deaglestylez> I may pick an injury piece from the crafting event
[2022-12-21 16:51:10] <lu2doe> actually ray with water's origin could be interesting, like he'd have pretty decent bulk right?
[2022-12-21 16:51:18] <ChotoMatte> check the battle replay they had with a lot of venom
[2022-12-21 16:51:22] <AlzasRegius> only he and sharun that can stack venom right?
[2022-12-21 16:51:29] <%+CayoticsYT> so in other words if you have 2 2 turn venoms that is 4 different venoms blowing up
[2022-12-21 16:51:29] <+turboman500> So yea, he doesn’t apply his own with s1 because he would immediately remove 20% health. Health that can’t be restored.
[2022-12-21 16:51:32] <ajip29> watch again the last ml ray match
[2022-12-21 16:51:32] <tundranocaps> You can pair him with fire Baal and Sezan, deal massive dmg for debuffs celrSip
[2022-12-21 16:51:39] <%+izzrick> he's a last pick

[2022-12-21 17:00:24] <%+CayoticsYT> i think ML Ray is an awesome concept an idea to a character, if they put cr push on his s1 to make him be the character you must kill, because he is slowly approaching getting faster but if you attack him he might counter do damage to you with venom and push himself closer to ending your team
[2022-12-21 17:00:26] <Szuuno> NOWAY mr white
