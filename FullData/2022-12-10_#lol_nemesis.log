[2022-12-10 16:58:50] <withavsteven> Hey guys, did you know that in terms of vastayan-human breeding, nami is the most compatible vastaya for humans? Not only is she a enchanter, which is mostly comprised of submissive and breedable creatures, Nami is 188cm or 6'2 long, 167.6cm or 5'6 tall, and weighs 90.7kg or 200lbs, this means shes large and plump enough to take a human dick, and with her impressive thigh and breast size and the ability to heal herself, you can be rough with her.
