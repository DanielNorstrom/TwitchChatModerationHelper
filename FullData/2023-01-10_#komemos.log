So the artifacts are meh. Got VERY lucky witht various national and meta team pulls. Just can't 3 star the second half of floor 10 chamber 3.  Anything you could do with the "redeem Abyss help" for me? Or is it too early?

[2023-01-10 11:46:50] <%+Hannibal_78> @komemos there could be two reason at that day, if you didn't tried since then. Hotspot and usb tethering mb not working at the same time, but also, it happend with me, if i connected first the cable to the computer, and not to the phone, the usb was inactive.  And yes, the cable also can be damaged, true.
