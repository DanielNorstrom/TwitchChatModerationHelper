[2022-12-02 15:15:26] <DEverchosen> well if capcom made re4 as short as re3 remake then this game is better than that

[2022-12-02 15:15:38] <G_Zephyr> so even this is a rip of the gravity gun?
[2022-12-02 15:15:40] <%raydra922> I wouldn't pay more than 40 for this TBH
[2022-12-02 15:15:43] <@^Streamlabs> CataclyzmV praises the Fex
[2022-12-02 15:15:46] <The_Metal_Elitist666> Until we stop buying 10 to 15 hour games for 60+ they're gonna keep shelling them out. They should be priced by length and replayability
[2022-12-02 15:15:55] <%GGitWasMeSmile> i would pay 29,99 for this
[2022-12-02 15:16:03] <%raydra922> Yeah
[2022-12-02 15:16:04] <+manny_919> this is a wait for a sale type of game

[2022-12-02 15:16:17] <%raydra922> If the campaign was double the time it could be 50+
[2022-12-02 15:16:19] <+TrashPanda923> Did you enjoy returnal?
[2022-12-02 15:16:23] <BubbaLovesYa> how long does it take to beat this game?
[2022-12-02 15:16:32] <+SamanoVI> @BubbaLovesYa he just said.
[2022-12-02 15:16:37] <ultimateei> it's 70 gb game
[2022-12-02 15:16:41] <+graymond> Yeah like hero‚Äôs
[2022-12-02 15:16:44] <%raydra922> I feel like they should release some free DLC's for this game and then it'd sell better
[2022-12-02 15:16:44] <bigtom6407> imagine having to boost your viewership just to be popular on twitch x.x
[2022-12-02 15:16:54] <BubbaLovesYa> I missed the length, but I heard him mention it's short @SamanoVI

[2022-12-02 15:17:27] <%raydra922> Yeah but men think with their pp so chopping the head off doesn't work
[2022-12-02 15:17:29] <adjuran89> So is this a dead space game or different universe?
[2022-12-02 15:17:30] <bigtom6407> @kaottic29 idk what that means lol

[2022-12-02 15:17:59] <default_guy77> this game should $30 at least, man :(
[2022-12-02 15:17:59] <BubbaLovesYa> that's a shame, so expensive, not original (looks like Dead Space exactly) and short :/ a big disappointment
[2022-12-02 15:18:08] <+theshiningnova> I read reviews saying this is stutter protocol. seems to run pretty smooth here
