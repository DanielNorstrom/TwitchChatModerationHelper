[2023-01-09 08:09:22] <@^Nightbot> Hi, I've just played a game of Big Priest and on turn 5 instead of conceding my opponent killed my hero ??? And then the screen showed "defeat" and i didn't even win a star ????? I'm so confused about what happened, so I was wondering if there was any way I could report this bug to Blizzard. For context this happened on the European server at about 5.50 pm. I'm currently Diamond 4 but I'm scared to play now. I don't know if it could be linked but it was 13¬∞C/55¬∞F

[2023-01-09 12:14:52] <narvoxx> @birthdeformities_ exp is based on game duration + some bonus if oyu win I think, this tilts people into conceding
[2023-01-09 12:14:55] <narvoxx> it's just exp fram
[2023-01-09 12:15:11] <birthdeformities_> but you can farm xp in mercenaries now
[2023-01-09 12:15:22] <some_marw> @birthdeformities_ goes to legend because people concede or generates lots of xp because matches take ages
