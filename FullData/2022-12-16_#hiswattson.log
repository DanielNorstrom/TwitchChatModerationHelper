I'll have you know I graduated top of my squad in the Apex Predator lobbies, and I've been involved in numerous secret raids on King's Canyon, and I have over 5,000 confirmed Mozambique kills. I am trained in grapple warfare and I'm the top Pathfinder in the entire Apex Games. You are nothing to me but just another target.
