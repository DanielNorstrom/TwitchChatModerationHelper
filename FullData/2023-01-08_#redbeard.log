[2023-01-08 06:50:18] <%Synastar> @talrielz the meta before was WAY LESS RNG BRO, and way less powerful cards. So the better player was easily identifiable

[2023-01-08 06:51:45] <%talrielz> Even though I am not a fan of Nathria's design I actually did pretty well overall in that expansion. I think i gained around 15k gold with the tavern pass for xp boost during that expansion's cycle. now im up barely 1k gold i think since this expansion's launch and its been a month+
[2023-01-08 06:52:25] <%talrielz> i don't think so either but i am an outlier as far as players go inherently and i can't even really excel gold wise

[2023-01-08 07:24:20] <!%$KBB24_Mamba_Forever> yeah but BGs can just start a new game and its so fast and there is a live leaderboard and you can look at your last 5 games, they could just add all these featrues to arena and improve it tremendously
[2023-01-08 07:24:22] <%+ABadxMan> poor priest already lost
[2023-01-08 07:24:48] <Ched_Cheese> I watch Dog Dog guy more for BGs and RedBeard is Arena. And don't watch any anyone play standard. Maybe...I forget his name but he usually streams after you and when I'm sleeping.
[2023-01-08 07:24:55] <%+ibrownietft> its also that if you lowroll in battle grounds you dont have to play and lose 3 times with the deck like arena. esp if you dont have enough gold to justify retiring decks
[2023-01-08 07:24:57] <Sebola3D> could that be what the leaderboard update Matt talked about might be?

[2023-01-08 07:25:12] <!%$KBB24_Mamba_Forever> they should also have an "arena pass" that gives you one free reroll when you get 3 dogwater picks
[2023-01-08 07:25:14] <%+Yap69> since they do leaderboards monthly it seems like they could very easily implement those in game

[2023-01-08 08:14:33] <%+ibrownietft> not sure if it was noted earlier or not, but the cuts between the clips felt a little out of place and weren't the easiest on the eyes when it flips to a black screen and then flips back to the bright colors of the hearthstone board. I know more high effort transitions probably take a ton of time for videos like that, but maybe like a default transition screen for flipping through clips might make it a bit more coherent/ easier on the eyes. Loved the video regardless tho <3

[2023-01-08 10:25:03] <%Quantum_TTV> if there was a card that does "whenever you summon a demon give it +1 attack" it would gain attack
[2023-01-08 10:25:06] <%3Lyra> I think it counts as summon but idk
[2023-01-08 10:25:14] <+peon47> "summon" means anything that puts on the board. Buzzard draws a card when you pull a beast with a similar effect.
[2023-01-08 10:25:15] <@%Tazny> Putting something on board is summoning it though isnt it, its just worded stupidly because HS is dumb
[2023-01-08 10:25:26] <%+KnightHawk_15> thats 1
[2023-01-08 10:25:41] <%+grevinzel> the card will say summon if its summon
[2023-01-08 10:25:58] <swagelinho> summon is every minion that appears on your board

[2023-01-08 10:26:17] <Impbloody> i mean its the same thing as like add a card to a hand vs drawing right?
[2023-01-08 10:26:27] <%3Lyra> Recruit counts as summon too and that doesn't say summon
[2023-01-08 10:26:44] <%zeddtinn> fudge hearthstone, it's a summon.
[2023-01-08 10:26:44] <%Quantum_TTV> it says recruit
[2023-01-08 10:26:47] <KULIXIS> Recruit is a keyword
[2023-01-08 10:26:57] <%3Lyra> Oh maybe the recruit keyword is defined as summon, not sure
[2023-01-08 10:26:58] <@%Tazny> But whats the description of the "recreuit" keyword when you mouse over it
[2023-01-08 10:27:11] <@%Tazny> I still think voidcaller should count though

[2023-01-08 11:48:56] <Papa_Woot> @jons420 i guess that's why he ended up in japan
[2023-01-08 11:49:41] <+CloverGrieveland> but I met undertaker while working my hotel job, and I have to say he was the coolest most genuine person ever. Other than his size, you'd have no clue he was a pro wrestler. Same with Andre the Giant from what I've heard
