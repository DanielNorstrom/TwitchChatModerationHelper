[2022-12-16 10:51:06] <@^StreamElements> Spyro_ZA is now live! Streaming Gwent: The Witcher Card Game: Lets get the rest of our factions to 2500
[2022-12-16 10:54:47] <%NoConcept_> AYAYALurk
[2022-12-16 11:08:17] <%BAPreda> surely we won't need leader here
[2022-12-16 11:08:27] <shombolism> nope
[2022-12-16 11:08:52] <%BAPreda> KEKWait
[2022-12-16 11:09:31] <+miltoff> how you doing, mr strimmer?
[2022-12-16 11:11:06] <%$xtskater> i dont get it why is ZA grid so dog shit
[2022-12-16 11:11:15] <+miltoff> you have driad from Artaud
[2022-12-16 11:12:48] <+miltoff> oppo is pepeGAS
[2022-12-16 11:12:53] <shombolism> ng is still unfair KEKL
[2022-12-16 11:13:10] <%BAPreda> should we maybe have kept torturer to guarantee a coup? seems kinda risky to play it this way
[2022-12-16 11:13:34] <%BAPreda> or just mulli the coup ig barcShrug
[2022-12-16 11:14:36] <%BAPreda> nice 1/25 barcEZ

[2022-12-16 11:17:13] <%BAPreda> doesn't make sense
[2022-12-16 11:17:23] <%BAPreda> Madgeclap
[2022-12-16 11:18:01] <ules77> with a remedy we can play the squire and get the infusion?
[2022-12-16 11:19:08] <shombolism> leader ?
[2022-12-16 11:19:33] <abdellahmrxx> i feel like the red knight was your leader
[2022-12-16 11:21:08] <hyperion100> mr streamer ur lacking point
[2022-12-16 11:21:27] <%BAPreda> we can still set up leader with steffen

[2022-12-16 11:23:56] <abdellahmrxx> okay maybe steffan is always better
[2022-12-16 11:24:20] <brokvarhunter> I hate temple so much. imagine just highrolling anseis, viraxas, viraxas
[2022-12-16 11:24:21] <%BAPreda> imagine we lose bc he rolled and drew viraxas from temple as well
[2022-12-16 11:24:39] <hyperion100> temple is just good

[2022-12-16 11:49:37] <%notlvcatto> Warriors Buffs, WoC to 5 Provs 3 Damage. So Harmony Schirru can burn em all more often
[2022-12-16 11:49:51] <%Methaies> @brokvarhunter it all depends on how well you let ng set up their gy in r1 imo. It is a very 5head matchup for assim

[2022-12-16 13:19:14] <@^StreamElements> Hey streamer I know this might be hard for you to undertsand but have you considered that opponent might just be more talented than you? Like for real, they must have some sort of talent to cram in every control card into one deck in the hopes that the queue roulette gives them a good matchup. Maybe just become more talented at queuing games instead of blaming opponents for being shit deckbuilders. Smh my head dawg 😔
