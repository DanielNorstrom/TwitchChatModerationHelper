[2023-01-06 07:49:33] <testificatetft> right now most streamers mute their music in the vod
[2023-01-06 07:49:38] <skola123123> if they copy strike it they can just remove the individual music feed anyway and keep on the voice game feed
[2023-01-06 07:49:56] <skola123123> would in fact improve vods alot

[2023-01-06 10:26:58] <%Shizoko> dont wanna backseat or chatting just want to ask, you had good defensive items and no characters at second augment. it seemed u gonna lost a lot at third stage but frontline items were fine so sivir could farm some gold. so u can go fast 8 there and roll before others to 2 star carries? cuze if u griefed a lot from items (like this game) at least u gonna have some gold.
[2023-01-06 10:27:46] <coral_reef> I feel like last whisper giant slayer is kinda essential in some lobbies for samira
