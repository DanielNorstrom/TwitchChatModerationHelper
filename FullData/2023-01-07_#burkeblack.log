[2023-01-07 08:57:09] <%Enitect> nah, he can absolutely destroy the base if hes directly under it.

[2023-01-07 11:32:59] <@%BleuBelladonna> I mean we could condense in some ways - but it would mean combing individual channels which is both good and bad. Could use forums so each subject has its own post but then people seem to be a bit iffy about that as well but at least we’d have seperate sections for each thing without adding clutter burkeShrug
[2023-01-07 11:33:12] <@%BleuBelladonna> Combining*
[2023-01-07 11:33:29] <auggie435> You'll need three rollipRage
[2023-01-07 11:33:30] <+Zhalnon> You'll need to use 2 and a honey @BurkeBlack
[2023-01-07 11:33:31] <%Spidersfury> @BleuBelladonna I am still new to Burke's stream, and his discord. It's been a easy transition overall, there have been a dozen or so channels that i muted but that's normal for any discord channel you are in, not everything is your taste. And im ok with that :)

[2023-01-07 11:36:08] <%Spidersfury> @BleuBelladonna It literally takes 2 seconds to mute a channel that you are just not into, so i don't think any changes are needed. I'm in i think 12 discord channels, it's so easy to pick and choose what you want to hear from.

[2023-01-07 13:33:42] <%N7Lawson> I wonder why they decided not to make this f2p
[2023-01-07 13:33:46] <+dnatunes2k> how do you like it? Do you know Overprime?
[2023-01-07 13:33:51] <+B00MCAKE> paragon was copying other ppls homework too much
[2023-01-07 13:33:53] <+B00MCAKE> this is much better
[2023-01-07 13:33:58] <+SkumbagDavee> @N7Lawson it is free 2 play just not during early access
[2023-01-07 13:34:05] <%N7Lawson> ah
[2023-01-07 13:34:17] <StaleSavage> they all the same
[2023-01-07 13:34:21] <+B00MCAKE> If I remember paragon just kept nicking stuff from OW and League
[2023-01-07 13:34:28] <+SkumbagDavee> this is the smaller of the reboots around
[2023-01-07 13:34:45] <hansa78> fortnite killed paragon.

[2023-01-07 13:35:07] <+SkumbagDavee> epic closed paragon to work on fortnite and made the assets free on epic store for companies

[2023-01-07 13:36:52] <+SkumbagDavee> i would argue this is not the king since its a tiny playerbase

[2023-01-07 13:37:40] <+B00MCAKE> well @SkumbagDavee this just needs a few months of youtube coverage and it will catch up
[2023-01-07 13:37:44] <%+WastingSanity> oh I guess I should say 1 v 2
[2023-01-07 13:37:48] <+Scorpio1401> upside down ! and ? are also Spanish.
[2023-01-07 13:38:01] <+B00MCAKE> the playerbase will grow as long as the devs keep nurturing it
[2023-01-07 13:38:13] <StaleSavage> is this sponsored?
[2023-01-07 13:38:15] <+SkumbagDavee> @B00MCAKE i think the non-refund marketting has hurt the game alot the other clones are miles ahead in player numbers right now
[2023-01-07 13:38:23] <+dnatunes2k> Predecessor is nice, just lack of content at this stage
[2023-01-07 13:38:51] <Deli_Ninja> @B00MCAKE i think it's coz the paragon spinoff is within the release date of this game which is the true successor of Paragon. so we have the Overwatch-Battleborne situation going on
[2023-01-07 13:38:58] <nebsun> I loved paragon in it's early days - didn't play much the last few years before they pulled it though, but seemed like it got overdeveloped
[2023-01-07 13:39:00] <+B00MCAKE> oh noooo
[2023-01-07 13:39:02] <hansa78> @BurkeBlack you should be runnin around with your mates

[2023-01-07 13:39:52] <+SkumbagDavee> yeah i think this is sat around 600-700 players whereas overprime is around 3-4k average
[2023-01-07 13:40:02] <Iretch> Narbash jungle
[2023-01-07 13:40:06] <@%Stonefather> Because it's free to play
[2023-01-07 13:40:09] <+dnatunes2k> @skumbag around 2k
[2023-01-07 13:40:11] <$d_schizzle> Paragon brought me Twitch once upon a time
[2023-01-07 13:40:12] <The_last_Cookie> It's free-to-play but worse
[2023-01-07 13:40:13] <Xiocata> overprime is free atm
[2023-01-07 13:40:15] <+B00MCAKE> Tribes: Ascend too, damn that was some fun shit
[2023-01-07 13:40:15] <hansa78> i spent close to 700 on paragon;;they refunded all of it when it closed down
[2023-01-07 13:40:28] <+SkumbagDavee> it has a larger company backing it so the updates/progress is faster
[2023-01-07 13:40:33] <@%Stonefather> You'd be surprised how many people can't or refuse to spend money on a game.
[2023-01-07 13:40:33] <nebsun> oh yeah, tribes was awesome
[2023-01-07 13:40:33] <+azwraithian> Overprime is free but I swear its not as good.
[2023-01-07 13:40:43] <+Eewec> @B00MCAKE Usually 'cos the devs focused on making a nice looking game that has all the content of a rice cake
[2023-01-07 13:40:50] <Coldfusie> demigod was the same back in 2009 loved it
[2023-01-07 13:40:50] <+B00MCAKE> Any tribes player will laugh at "omg fastest octane player ever" videos :D
[2023-01-07 13:40:57] <@%Stonefather> It's why free to play games are huge because there is no barrier to entry other than internet.

[2023-01-07 13:41:12] <Deli_Ninja> is predecessor not free to play?

[2023-01-07 13:41:37] <+SkumbagDavee> no ninja you have to pay a non refundable purchase for early acess, once it "launches" its free to playt
[2023-01-07 13:41:46] <@%Stonefather> There is plenty of free to play games with extremely low hardware requirement.
[2023-01-07 13:41:59] <%Willetzky> burkeItsfine how many hours do you play a year
[2023-01-07 13:42:03] <Deli_Ninja> ah ok. so that's probably why it's lower playercount then

[2023-01-07 13:44:01] <+B00MCAKE> I accidentally pre ordered the collectors edition for SWTOR when I was in school, and when I turned up they got a box out and were like "thats £120 please"
[2023-01-07 13:44:03] <+B00MCAKE> I was shook
[2023-01-07 13:44:04] <Deli_Ninja> i played the Original Paragon on ps4 :)
[2023-01-07 13:44:06] <+Scorpio1401> I heard something about that, But I can't tell if it would just be a Nostalgia kick now or if it's still as good as back then @boostedwrx27
[2023-01-07 13:44:10] <+B00MCAKE> but I crumbled and bought it
[2023-01-07 13:44:19] <+B00MCAKE> it was like my months wages as a 16 year old at the time :D
[2023-01-07 13:44:32] <+boostedwrx27> @Scorpio1401 they actually have a dev team for homecoming servers. its legit, and very good, it still holds up in todays world

[2023-01-07 13:45:59] <AuroraBorealisNo> What is "free look"?
[2023-01-07 13:46:19] <+B00MCAKE> free look is looking without changing direction
[2023-01-07 13:46:21] <Deli_Ninja> free look is a camera movement where your character stays still so you can look at his front
[2023-01-07 13:46:25] <+B00MCAKE> its like when you press alt in dayz or arma 3
[2023-01-07 13:46:26] <AuroraBorealisNo> ah
[2023-01-07 13:46:42] <freshlife> wait didn't a company already make a game like this...
[2023-01-07 13:46:42] <+Scorpio1401> @boostedwrx27 ahh ok, that's still cool though. I need to go look into it a bit.
[2023-01-07 13:46:42] <Deli_Ninja> otherwise, the back will always face your camera :)

[2023-01-07 13:47:28] <+hellscythe_2319> Everyone builds their character differently so some builds outclasses others, that’s why some hero’s seem OP
[2023-01-07 13:47:29] <%Varanid> there's a LOT going on in those team fights
[2023-01-07 13:47:29] <+DrNucleotides> honestly a good trade there imo. he's a bit higher level than you
[2023-01-07 13:47:32] <%Spidersfury> It's like a combination of everything that's come out over the past 10 years, mashed into one
[2023-01-07 13:48:05] <freshlife> true that's what I was thinking but are they not risking a lot of money
[2023-01-07 13:48:09] <@%Stonefather> I know, I'm a boomer I guess because I really don't like any of the extremely popular games.
[2023-01-07 13:48:17] <AxiosImmortal> there are good games but dont get attention sometimes because theres too many
[2023-01-07 13:48:18] <+B00MCAKE> its really tragic isn't it tbh, how the multiplayer scene is so dependant on the crowd

[2023-01-07 13:48:27] <+Scorpio1401> That's why I gotta hand it to devs that do this. Make a second attempt after trying to fix what was wrong with the first one. And maybe it will catch on.
[2023-01-07 13:48:32] <loksmurfen> HoN and Dota
[2023-01-07 13:48:33] <StaleSavage> @Stonefather whats popular
[2023-01-07 13:48:35] <%Spidersfury> That's true, Burke
[2023-01-07 13:48:38] <+Scorpio1401> Like FF XIV totally remaking itself.
[2023-01-07 13:48:39] <+Eewec> True, Wildstar springs to mind
[2023-01-07 13:48:42] <Deli_Ninja> League of legends didn't come out polished as it is now. but it was the first one that came out that was stand-alone DoTA
[2023-01-07 13:48:44] <%+MrKhanes> so true
[2023-01-07 13:48:46] <+B00MCAKE> Firefall was an incredible unique mmo, remember firefall?
[2023-01-07 13:48:47] <@%Stonefather> @StaleSavage I mean the current Meta is Escape from Tarkov.

[2023-01-07 13:48:58] <alen_crnalic> League of Legends is Dota from Wish .com
[2023-01-07 13:49:02] <%+WastingSanity> highly recommend working on your level.. you are currently about 4 levels behind the enemy
[2023-01-07 13:49:03] <posmeester> So what is the best mmo right now
[2023-01-07 13:49:05] <%+lord_lobster> I still play wow because it's been like 20 years and i don't want to put that much effort into a new MMO LUL
