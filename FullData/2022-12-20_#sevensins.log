[2022-12-20 00:55:12] <%Critterbot> Shouldn't reruns be shown as actual reruns and not live like this?

[2022-12-20 05:55:12] <%BoomBaybi> @monsturmun the only way bgg would know is if he tried to chat without verifying his account. and since he's in those chats.... he's obviously verified. there's nothing to tell him that it's need
[2022-12-20 05:55:22] <%BoomBaybi> *needed
[2022-12-20 05:55:52] <@%BGG02> yeah I don't know these things lol

[2022-12-20 05:57:58] <%monsturmun> discrimination kinda
[2022-12-20 05:58:49] <%zazu1019> except it was to protect their business because they were getting bombed by bots and racist trolls so they had to do it to protect the larger community as a whole not just to stop 1-2 people from chatting
[2022-12-20 05:59:46] <%monsturmun> IDK that reasons why, I just know that not everyone is a bot right!

[2022-12-20 10:41:14] <%Valinore> I like the trance mechanic..it's just poorly implemented
[2022-12-20 10:41:25] <%Neobullseye> I mean, it's cool for story purposes , and it's powerful enough that I get they don't want you to keep an entire team worth of Trances in stock at all times.
[2022-12-20 10:41:30] VIEWERS: 365
[2022-12-20 10:41:38] <%Neobullseye> But at least let me keep some of it?
[2022-12-20 10:41:59] <%+russybcool> but if you are in a trance you are not in control by definition. it makes sense but the lack of control from gameplay perspective is odd
[2022-12-20 10:42:05] <%Lonefellow> One thing that would make it less annoying is if you get to keep some of the trance bar if it's not completely used up. Like, 50%, whatever.
[2022-12-20 10:42:23] <%Neobullseye> Like a... If your Trance Bar fills up completely and you do not activate it, you get to keep 50% of it or something.
[2022-12-20 10:42:49] <%+russybcool> but it is the one negative in an awesome game
[2022-12-20 10:43:00] <%Lonefellow> Like someone said in BGGs chat yesterday, Trance was an overraction to the Limit spam in FF8.
[2022-12-20 10:43:26] <%AngaPeeters> and then FFX came with their limit breaks...

[2022-12-20 11:40:41] <+JaymieGamer> yea ill make penelo white mahe until cura is born then do red mage and battle mage later lol

[2022-12-20 11:41:17] <%Lonefellow> Both are good if done well.

[2022-12-20 11:50:20] <%frog_89_> i never had trouble with 10 other than 1 seymor fight
[2022-12-20 11:50:25] <%AJReid93> Easiest = IX or X Hardest = VIII
[2022-12-20 11:50:36] <%Selnica> my habit of beign a grinder, for money, and levels, really made thigns easier for me on 4
[2022-12-20 11:50:40] <big4lil> 10 is easy overall but with very difficult spikes. probably the toughest storyline bosses
[2022-12-20 11:50:45] <Jay_san_swed> i felt 8 was easiest, but i caught on to junctions quick..
[2022-12-20 11:50:54] <+zulu189> I remember getting soft locked on my first ffx playthrough towards the end
[2022-12-20 11:51:07] <%Neobullseye> Easiest? Probably 7. Aside from maybe two bosses, I can't recall there being any real hard spots in that game.
[2022-12-20 11:51:13] <%Diacor4Life> I think, funny enough, FF8 is the easiest and hardest at the same time, depending if you go blind, or know how to break the game. But yeah, FF8 takes the "easiest" cake for me
[2022-12-20 11:51:17] <Jay_san_swed> i got soft locked on my first playthrough on demon wall ff7
[2022-12-20 11:51:18] <%AJReid93> I was a noob with junctioning in VIII and missed a lot of hidden GFs (I was young...)
[2022-12-20 11:51:22] <+thisadsupportstwitch1> The easiest for me was 13
[2022-12-20 11:51:23] <%Neobullseye> Not counting optional stuff, of course.
[2022-12-20 11:51:46] VIEWERS: 412
[2022-12-20 11:51:53] <%Neobullseye> By current knowledge though, FF8  is by far the easiest one.
[2022-12-20 11:51:55] <%+Kwigo> ff8 is easy if you card every enemy
[2022-12-20 11:51:56] <%daimonologos> FF8 is all about junctions. if you get it, the game is just attack attack attack
[2022-12-20 11:52:03] <%Neonlare> Easiest FF for me : FF2 Hardest FF for me : FF9
[2022-12-20 11:52:13] <%+Vo0DoOTwitch> Easiest was IX for me, but then I always grinded for hours, until I had learned all the skills before advsnci g further
[2022-12-20 11:52:18] <%Neonlare> FF2 I just grinded up swords and just bulldozed the game
[2022-12-20 11:52:18] <Jay_san_swed> same LUL , but i experimented a lot and luckily found out was that worked well
[2022-12-20 11:52:34] <%Skyblueaqua> once I fully understood the junction system, FF8 was by far the easiest
[2022-12-20 11:52:35] <%+Kwigo> ff13 was easy as well until you hit the last chapter if you didn't farm in the open area
[2022-12-20 11:52:44] <%Selnica> I cut my RPG teeth on Dragonw arrior 1 on NES. grinding until normal enoucnters are easy is a lesson I NEVER forgot
[2022-12-20 11:52:54] <+occamsbaseballbat> most rpgs difficulty depends on how early in the main story the game lets you break the game
[2022-12-20 11:52:57] <%+Kwigo> XV got hard AF once you hit endgame if you didn't farm a bit
[2022-12-20 11:53:08] <%daimonologos> yeah thats true
[2022-12-20 11:53:27] <+occamsbaseballbat> XV had no difficulty apart from how fast you could spam potion
[2022-12-20 11:53:28] <Jay_san_swed> i find ff9 quite difficult either way unless you simply grind, but i get your point
[2022-12-20 11:53:35] <%randolfthegrey1> it was ff7 for me
[2022-12-20 11:53:48] VIEWERS: 419
[2022-12-20 11:53:52] <%Lonefellow> I mean, every FF is sort of difficult if you only focus the MSQ. I believe it was balanced around that mostly.
[2022-12-20 11:54:03] <%frog_89_> ff9 last dungeon was very stressful first time around
[2022-12-20 11:54:07] <+thisadsupportstwitch1> Haha I loved DW on nes too lol
[2022-12-20 11:54:15] <%+JaymieGamer> i beat FF8 with rinoa=11, squall=7, questis=8, zell=8, selphie=7 level end game with most GF at 100. restt didnt gain levels. i only grinded with siefer,squall=dead, zell=dead. edea, rest party dead, those was only my grindy spots. lol
[2022-12-20 11:54:30] <%Neobullseye> FF2 NES is cruel as hell. FF2 'modern' is hilariously breakable :P
[2022-12-20 11:54:34] <iamcooldan> I understand that from a final fantasy perspective phoenix down is likely some form of feather that just gets applied to the skin, but I can't help but imagine the characters looking like they tried to eat a pillow/blanket and bit off more than they could chew
[2022-12-20 11:54:39] <+thisadsupportstwitch1> My nes wouldn't save so I had to leave it on
[2022-12-20 11:54:46] <%+JaymieGamer> Ervine lv 13 lol
[2022-12-20 11:54:51] <Jay_san_swed> now i wanna replay all ff games without grinding.. naturally after already knowing them, i end up knowing where and when to grind a little. i crave that difficulty back
[2022-12-20 11:55:06] <%Lonefellow> I only played FF2 GBA and the fact that you can comfortably grind in Fynn and then descend to Mysidia in a couple of hours before the first dungeon is very funny LUL

[2022-12-20 11:59:46] <%Lonefellow> I haven't played 11 since 2011 but is RDM still the best choice for soloing?
[2022-12-20 11:59:50] VIEWERS: 414
[2022-12-20 12:00:00] <%renpool> Ff11 was the first dark souls jk. Every fight was a boss battle
[2022-12-20 12:00:32] <Jay_san_swed> it didn't help i imagined theif would be a cool job to stick to when soloing
[2022-12-20 12:00:56] <+occamsbaseballbat> yea now that i think about it if 11 gets included its not even a question of whats hardest that game was insane, but i did love it for a few years lol
[2022-12-20 12:01:02] <%renpool> Yes, I went thief too, but was worth it
[2022-12-20 12:01:40] <big4lil> @occamsbaseballbat if X-2 didnt have so much blatant cheese, it would def be among the hardest. maybe it still is even with minimal cheesing
[2022-12-20 12:01:50] VIEWERS: 423
[2022-12-20 12:02:40] <+occamsbaseballbat> @big4lil did you play 11? that game had sadistic levels of difficulty on some things
[2022-12-20 12:03:00] <%renpool> Wakka has a ball though
[2022-12-20 12:03:14] <%GanD988> we are still at disk 1 ?
[2022-12-20 12:03:17] <%Lonefellow> FFX is excellent in the sense that random encounters are set up as character puzzles from the beginning. "This type of enemy? Use this character!"
[2022-12-20 12:03:27] <big4lil> no i was just adding another game to the mix. i came up when XI was popular though, im well aware of its difficulty (esp prepatch)
[2022-12-20 12:03:42] <oskape> Yuna, Wakka and Tidus. Give Yuna tier 1 black magic.
[2022-12-20 12:03:47] <%+JaymieGamer> in FFX-2 I used to flee from everything in ch1 and go to moonflow. it would be a 5 star area so im too weak there but i still pulled it off

[2022-12-20 12:05:08] <%+JaymieGamer> thats why theres friendly spheres @sevensins
[2022-12-20 12:05:25] <Jay_san_swed> aside from lulu tho, yuna is somewhat given right`? i mean, summoner and all

[2022-12-20 12:06:16] <%+JaymieGamer> u can teleport to spheres already learned, u wont need to open path seven
[2022-12-20 12:06:18] <Jay_san_swed> @Lonefellow wdym, vaan is cool midnabCry
[2022-12-20 12:06:19] <+occamsbaseballbat> i think the ability to break rpgs is why i dont mind the game being linear early, like ff7 remake i didnt feel like i broke to early pacing was decent, but playing crisis core recently i broke that game by chapter 4 on hard did minerva at level 56 or something, i feel some side content needs to be more gated
[2022-12-20 12:06:34] <%+JaymieGamer> they got teleport spheres
[2022-12-20 12:06:36] <%frog_89_> was not vaan like the best char for shields or something
[2022-12-20 12:06:41] <%Lonefellow> I mean in the sense that Vaan isn't overwhelmingly above the rest of the party (or at least he doesn't feel that way).

[2022-12-20 13:11:06] <%Diacor4Life> It's kind of the same thing as with Aerith, for some reason EU translators lost the memo and named her Aeris, after the way they pronounced her name in Japan (kind of Aerisu). In NA they actually named her Aerith, which was correct way. The fact that they pronounce it Tee-Dus in Japan, shouldn't mean it should also be said so in English

[2022-12-20 13:55:13] <%+spectr0nn> @dasragwurz i mean, never say never, but i think chances are slim. the reason they are remaking FF7 in the first place is because its the most popular FF next to 10, so they were able to make a good business case for that. its a huge investment in terms of time and money

[2022-12-20 14:17:34] <%+spectr0nn> didnt logitech do a 'remaster' of an older mouse once? i seem to remember something like that happening

[2022-12-20 14:17:57] <%CynniUniflame> So might hand is always slightly tilted on my mouse to use my index finger on the left mouse button

[2022-12-20 14:20:39] <%+spectr0nn> best part of the switch pro is the d-pad i think
[2022-12-20 14:20:59] <%XyFreak> it's propably THE controller with the best analog sticks on the market right now
[2022-12-20 14:21:09] <%XyFreak> it's modelled after the switch pro controller

[2022-12-20 14:31:47] <%N0LIMITBREAK> yea
[2022-12-20 14:31:56] <%Lonefellow> And it's a PS2 game originally
[2022-12-20 14:32:04] <%$Quadradic> G'morning @NorthRex
[2022-12-20 14:32:36] <%+spectr0nn> PS4 version of a remaster on PS3 of a PS2 game played on a PS5

[2022-12-20 14:32:42] <deathroy88> Only main line ff games in the fiesta?
[2022-12-20 14:33:10] <+nemo_76> worst menu in any FF game is FF7 remaster for ps4, so hard to accurately choose your options
[2022-12-20 14:33:39] <%+spectr0nn> that menu is 30 fps isnt it
[2022-12-20 14:34:05] <+nemo_76> not sure, but it happens on ps5 as well
[2022-12-20 14:34:30] <+nemo_76> its 60fps most of the time, but there's soemtihng strange about the menu, its out of sync and the cursor often skips a line
[2022-12-20 14:34:37] VIEWERS: 564
[2022-12-20 14:34:37] <%Lonefellow> I think he means the FFVII OG on PS4 Sev
[2022-12-20 14:34:39] <%+spectr0nn> he means the remaster

[2022-12-20 14:37:55] <%Lonefellow> Is that something modders can fix or does it require an actual code deep dive from the devs themselves?

[2022-12-20 14:38:20] <%+spectr0nn> in the original FF8 the menus run at 60 fps while the battle scenes are 30 fps iirc. which makes the menuing snappy. with the pc version and subsequent releases the menu framerate is tied to the rest of the game and its all at 30
[2022-12-20 14:38:21] <%Lonefellow> Sry Para, I just asked D:

[2022-12-20 15:16:12] <%+spectr0nn> its interesting because they do dynamic music in FF7R all the time for example

[2022-12-20 15:19:02] <!%+yrvengalied> same Beef or Chicken for us
[2022-12-20 15:19:18] <!%+yrvengalied> rarely fish broth
[2022-12-20 15:19:54] <!%+yrvengalied> Ramen with Tomato broth Hmm
[2022-12-20 15:19:56] <%Neobullseye> Just checked a Youtube vid: The PSX version also has a seamless transit.
[2022-12-20 15:19:59] <%CynniUniflame> hmmm tomato soup
[2022-12-20 15:20:10] <%CynniUniflame> My fave is mushroom soup though
[2022-12-20 15:20:13] <!%+yrvengalied> isnt that just Spaghetti sevenKEK in a way
[2022-12-20 15:20:29] <%quovad15> In my experience the best Ramen shops have just one type of stock and broth. In general a small menu, but they make up with amazing quality and usually its not so pricy, because they don't have to buy a big variety of ingredients
[2022-12-20 15:20:34] <%CynniUniflame> with balls, seven XD

[2022-12-20 15:20:56] <%+MrZev> Spagetti is a type of noodle.
[2022-12-20 15:20:57] <%quovad15> at least it's what I prefer in Japan
[2022-12-20 15:21:33] <%quovad15> Oh don't go there with Pasta
[2022-12-20 15:21:35] <%CynniUniflame> we do have Ramen restaurants though. But few. I head that they have a really good one in Eindhoven
[2022-12-20 15:21:35] <%vlashin_> Spaghetti is a type of pasta
[2022-12-20 15:21:55] <%vlashin_> source: married a quarter Italian
[2022-12-20 15:21:59] <%quovad15> There are about 12 types of Spaghetti
[2022-12-20 15:22:12] <!%+yrvengalied> same
[2022-12-20 15:22:19] <%vlashin_> yeah typically pasta with sauce is going to be named after the style of pasta
[2022-12-20 15:22:20] <%NorthRex> I prefer vermicelli, ou capelli d'angelo, with a good meat sauce. omnomnom
[2022-12-20 15:22:25] <%+MrZev> like if you have a meaty spagetti sauce... thats called a bolognese
[2022-12-20 15:22:34] <%Neobullseye> Then again, we tend to drown our pastas in sauce.
[2022-12-20 15:22:42] <%TwitchTemplar> Guess bolognese is the most common one after all
[2022-12-20 15:22:49] <%CynniUniflame> The most eaten pasta dishes here are spaghetti & macaroni and oddly in almost the same sauce XD

[2022-12-20 15:23:11] <%+MrZev> @Neobullseye  because its deliecious that way
[2022-12-20 15:23:11] <%Lonefellow> The I just noticed that the Alexandrian flag looks like the old royal Greek flag
[2022-12-20 15:23:24] <%quovad15> A bolognese is a type of ragout, that originally came from the italian city of Bologna
[2022-12-20 15:23:24] <!%+yrvengalied> same
[2022-12-20 15:23:29] <%+Lady_Lorr> We call the dish spaghetti too, but it is specifically the pasta, but if you used angel hair pasta you could still call it spaghtti
[2022-12-20 15:24:09] <%CynniUniflame> yeah, I often put more veggies in the sauce Seven, like mushrooms or zucchini
[2022-12-20 15:24:33] <%+Lady_Lorr> yes the sauce is Bolognese
[2022-12-20 15:24:36] <%NorthRex> basically, when you are having pasta, you need three things: the pasta, the sauce, and the drowsiness from having eaten way too much
[2022-12-20 15:24:48] <%CynniUniflame> chestnut mushrooms
[2022-12-20 15:24:52] VIEWERS: 596
[2022-12-20 15:24:56] <%Lonefellow> bolognese is minced meat and tomato sauce, right?
[2022-12-20 15:25:04] <%quovad15> so if I came to the Netherlands and ordered Spaghetti, I would receive Spaghetti Bolognese?
[2022-12-20 15:25:25] <%quovad15> ok
[2022-12-20 15:25:51] <%CynniUniflame> yeah italian restaurants also have things like pasta pesto
[2022-12-20 15:25:56] <%quovad15> I have only been once to Adam
[2022-12-20 15:26:15] <%Neobullseye> Hey, at least we don't 'clean' our chicken with chlorine bathes.

[2022-12-20 15:27:39] <%CynniUniflame> Yeah same with Rotterdam and Utrecht XD
[2022-12-20 15:27:39] <%AJReid93> I'm taking my wife to Amsterdam in January - any recommendations on places to eat/things to do centrally?

[2022-12-20 15:27:48] <%Lonefellow> There was a moment in my teenage years when I almost moved to the Hague. Fizzled out in the last moment, sadly.

[2022-12-20 15:42:03] <%Yurizo007> ah. that's somewhat how it feels yes. lol. I thought a higher number was good. maybe. the arrows are easy enough to get at least lol

[2022-12-20 15:42:35] <%romu852> dat 1 job max in FF12 tho! man it would be freaking great challenge with random picking
[2022-12-20 15:42:42] <%Neobullseye> Higher numbers are generally good. However, lower numbers can still kill higher numbers if RNG decides so.
[2022-12-20 15:42:54] <%+Kinitawowi> i usually try to get a crappy card with as many arrows as possible, then just keep attacking that one card for the combo
[2022-12-20 15:42:56] <%Yurizo007> that's such bulldoodoo

[2022-12-20 15:43:25] <%+spectr0nn> iirc the M means magical attack and P means physical attack and the last two numbers refer to respectively the physical and magical defense. having said all that, there's still some RNG involved i believe

[2022-12-20 17:01:53] <%Felknia_> idk why but this exact screen and this music are the one I think of when I think of FFIX
[2022-12-20 17:01:55] <%blaze800000> 10 got yes
[2022-12-20 17:03:00] <AxiesTheCollector> @Felknia_ Me too! I think it's because this is the first area where you spend a big chunk of time outside the first bits.

[2022-12-20 17:04:08] <%rikkuster> I like that we get to go back to Lindblum and other major cities multiple times in this game
[2022-12-20 17:04:20] <%rikkuster> They aren't just one-off areas you don't need/want to go back to
[2022-12-20 17:04:55] <@%RabidAmoeba> They said something about 2023
