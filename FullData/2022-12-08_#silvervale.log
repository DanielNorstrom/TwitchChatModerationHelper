[2022-12-08 05:18:02] <$Catpis_Everstink> the horror is good, just not on pc
[2022-12-08 05:18:02] <%Cyberius> If you told me the Simpsons predicted Vtubing in the early 2000's

[2022-12-08 05:18:02] <!%Protoborg_XXXII> its mostly cause its not optimized for PC

[2022-12-08 05:18:54] <$Professor_Wisteria_> story is good, imo
[2022-12-08 05:18:56] <%BlueMage_VT> have you talked to Kon about it? he seems to enjoy it well enough

[2022-12-08 05:19:13] <%jack_the_rat_> the remake looks nice
[2022-12-08 05:19:13] <fannyplayer1> o
[2022-12-08 05:19:13] <Tyrannodokuro> have you played gigabash? it's a kaiju fighting game and there's godzilla dlc for it now :3
[2022-12-08 05:19:13] <tommyp915> idk I enjoyed the story
[2022-12-08 05:19:14] <@%+sonic_slades> Yeah, it's just Dead Space, coming next month, or technically next year.
[2022-12-08 05:19:14] <%Faraam_The_Nameless_Lord> Story is pretty basic from what I’ve seen
[2022-12-08 05:19:15] <$paladin_borrace> Love Dead Space
[2022-12-08 05:19:16] <%+Tzuzhi> combat system is very questionable
[2022-12-08 05:19:16] <!%+PsychoStingerXD> the Combat System is Boring
[2022-12-08 05:19:16] <%AtlantisPrince> Apparently, Calisto Protocol leaves a lot to desire, especially when you consider, what these guys achieved with Dead Space so many years ago.
[2022-12-08 05:19:17] <Dragonmage666> @Silvervale did you see Choo-Choo Charles that is coming soon?
[2022-12-08 05:19:19] <!%Protoborg_XXXII> there also silent hill remake coming i think
[2022-12-08 05:19:19] <%Daegarde> POGGERS is it like Skyrim's re-re-re-re release +fishing?

[2022-12-08 05:19:20] <Psychokiller72> no, the combat system is fun
[2022-12-08 05:19:21] <+acesaber12> supposedly the dead space remake has a completely different story than the original
[2022-12-08 05:19:21] <Tenkata_Senetai> Wait, there is a goat simulator 3?
[2022-12-08 05:19:21] <%Google_DeezNutz> the combat system is just punch-out lol
[2022-12-08 05:19:25] <$t_kermi> After the 10h clone generation there would be 2047 clones per 1 original person.

[2022-12-08 05:50:55] <Just_Reboot> means it stays sweet because they don't distill all the sugar out of it

[2022-12-08 05:50:58] <%ren0195> sugar probably
[2022-12-08 05:51:00] <Sandylocks2412> Okay, sand in your private place.
[2022-12-08 05:51:00] <jonyoren> Lmao
[2022-12-08 05:51:01] <%+m00se666> It’s sweeter, with less actual alcohol in it
[2022-12-08 05:51:01] <Stochastic_Gnu> No it generally denotes a low alcohol flavored "add-on" to a stronger base.
[2022-12-08 05:51:02] <+Slacker_X_> it is premixed with syrup
[2022-12-08 05:51:03] <BradNotMad> NODDERS

[2022-12-08 05:53:17] <+VitaeMoon> @Silvervale A liqueur is an alcoholic drink composed of spirits and additional flavorings such as sugar, fruits, herbs, and spices. Often served with or after dessert, they are typically heavily sweetened and un-aged beyond a resting period during production, when necessary, for their flavors to mingle.

[2022-12-08 09:45:49] <@%loltwitchmods> bring the lazer to the second sensor that opens the door then go back to the third floor for the bridge

[2022-12-08 09:45:55] <mckrupin> use tall block to get up
[2022-12-08 09:46:00] <+zensnowfall> the box gets you to the second level already
[2022-12-08 09:46:00] <%Dsyphus> because that would make the puzzles too easy
[2022-12-08 09:46:06] <+zensnowfall> just rewind the box back to the pad
[2022-12-08 09:46:07] <%XERXZ2> ok im off silver got Computer this to do have a great night good luck on your game
[2022-12-08 09:46:08] <!%SparkWizard> I think you move the laser block to the lower panel and rewind it to the upper panel, that way you have access

[2022-12-08 09:46:16] <%Dexterion07> take the laser to top, then grab laser drop top and drop to middle level to open door, then move the collapsible box to button and use stairs to climb, and rewind laser once on muddle level

[2022-12-08 09:46:31] <mckrupin> now move the laser block to the middle level
[2022-12-08 09:46:38] <mx990> Rewind laser first to lower receptor, get in lower door, then rewind to upper receptor with box on the door plate
[2022-12-08 09:46:38] <%red_fifteen> you rewind the little box from one lock to the other silver
[2022-12-08 09:46:39] <WhiteWolfe858> Can’t rewind the big box unfortunately
[2022-12-08 09:46:40] <Connor_Rage> I don’t know what’s more impressive, solving the puzzles or designing/creating them
