[2022-12-10 11:19:09] <bikash99> That's because of how the Netherlands players acted.
[2022-12-10 11:19:10] <thatguywhoeats> the Netherlands players where walking in the way as the Argentina players were stepping up to take pens, deserved imo
[2022-12-10 11:19:10] <+ir4tsem> Their manager didnt respect them shit, why would Argentina respect them? @Boraslegend
[2022-12-10 11:19:10] <+MiguelMontalvao> Argentina are a bunch of "caceteiros"
[2022-12-10 11:19:11] <georgi007fut> Messi is a toxic little rat
[2022-12-10 11:19:11] <+MonstaReqs> the Netherlands manager shouldn't have chatted shit about having the upper hand in pens before the game. chat shit get burned imo
[2022-12-10 11:19:11] <%+kiliev02> They have this against  Netherlands because of what they were saying before the game

[2022-12-10 11:20:10] <faisalkhan1029> They did it because dumbfries was being toxic during pens
[2022-12-10 11:20:11] <Stonecooold12> @lucas33305 That’s cause Ronaldo is always toxic that’s why people really enjoying his older days now, extremely calm and not toxic now!

[2022-12-10 11:21:19] <+ir4tsem> Mbappe could fuck Croatia up in final tbh
[2022-12-10 11:21:20] <ziikkoo87> two penalty wins can be tough on the body tho
[2022-12-10 11:21:21] <eddie_1401> nah disagree here Croatia are the prefect match-up for Aregentina because they play slow they are a more effective Poland.
[2022-12-10 11:21:22] <!WONDERS_X_> with good fight we don't mind Croatia out ?!
[2022-12-10 11:21:22] <EitchBee> Messi dislikes van gal because of how he treated Di Maria and riquelme. A long with what he said before the match
[2022-12-10 11:21:23] <thelonglegsdwarf> acuna suspended

[2022-12-10 11:21:35] <+thomas_w04> argentinia is so bad in attack compared to brazil so i think croatia will win
[2022-12-10 11:21:36] <siniture> Netherlands playaa were toxic first and provoking Argentinian that's why they all got abit mad
[2022-12-10 11:21:37] <%+kiliev02> Acuna won’t play because of cards
[2022-12-10 11:21:40] <mr_zayo> Gvardiol is croatian maldini

[2022-12-10 11:21:47] <+Hjorthi> Netherlands the toxic one, its a reason the Argentina players were toxic, do your homework
[2022-12-10 11:21:49] <%zodiac1455> Gvardiol is in the moment the best defender in the WC
[2022-12-10 11:21:51] <+blackcoats76> Can Morocco cause an upset tonight
[2022-12-10 11:21:51] <+tinaniwa> yes

[2022-12-10 11:22:12] <zitleoud> CR7 will cry today
[2022-12-10 11:22:14] <%+bagele> acuna s not performing well tho not that big of a W i think
[2022-12-10 11:22:14] <RICKALING> tagliafico is a decent replacement tbh
[2022-12-10 11:22:17] <%bgeorgiev9622> after quaterfinal i think
[2022-12-10 11:22:18] <zejd1234> Brozović pocketing Messi again soon
[2022-12-10 11:22:18] <ville_26> good striker for 350k @BorasLegend
[2022-12-10 11:22:19] <%+SwedTec> messis handball was far worse than romero who got a yellow for his
[2022-12-10 11:22:19] <gurraisvibin> Virgil should've got sent off hahaha
[2022-12-10 11:22:20] <@%badnewsbasterd> the refs pocket went full during that game
[2022-12-10 11:22:21] <@%badnewsbasterd> LUL
[2022-12-10 11:22:23] <+Hjorthi> Why??
[2022-12-10 11:22:25] <+nnnoyade> As our commentary said: "If you're Argentinan at a world cup, you're allowed to do a bit more with your hands."
[2022-12-10 11:22:25] <$rv078> Ref is a messi fanboy, even follows him on instagram
[2022-12-10 11:22:27] <svennen79> Open ur packs
[2022-12-10 11:22:30] <%+stefan940> paredes too
[2022-12-10 11:22:31] <%+Realfan91> messi did nothing in the after match interview then critisizing the referee...
[2022-12-10 11:22:31] <nikkhil18> tagliafico should be fine though
[2022-12-10 11:22:32] <+BotBill32> @svennen79 Can you shhh?

[2022-12-10 11:22:34] <+Hjorthi> Why?
[2022-12-10 11:22:34] <+ir4tsem> the ref was awful for both teams
[2022-12-10 11:22:35] <Muskovitz> if argntina get many yellows again, even if they win, many players will be suspended in finals
[2022-12-10 11:22:35] <%doezoeloesoe> parades made 3 yellow fouls in a row and still didn’t get send off 😂😂
[2022-12-10 11:22:36] <zejd1234> Messi vs Ronaldo for 3rd place LUL
[2022-12-10 11:22:37] <+exmachinee> virgil ??? he should also get sent off

[2022-12-10 11:22:37] <lucguldager> What about Paredes??
[2022-12-10 11:22:40] <+MonstaReqs> timber should of been sent of also got yellow carded then did 4 more fouls after should of gone off the pitch
[2022-12-10 11:22:43] <+cwhite661> He wouldn’t have played the same with a yellow of course
[2022-12-10 11:22:44] <+Guillermos> Nahh CR7 is goat
[2022-12-10 11:22:46] <RICKALING> yeah tagliafico on LB is decent

[2022-12-10 11:23:12] <On_The_Edge_09> crazy how he kicked the ball into the dutch bench... :D that was so nasty
[2022-12-10 11:23:16] <gigigi009> That would be nice
[2022-12-10 11:23:17] <MatosPlays> Van Dijk also should’ve been sent off
[2022-12-10 11:23:21] <matkokc3> i want a croatia-morocoo final
[2022-12-10 11:23:21] <gurraisvibin> CR7 comeback and will score i hope

[2022-12-10 11:23:23] <cryptoaddict27> messi should had been sent off he was forgiven so many yellow cards
[2022-12-10 11:23:24] <%+Realfan91> messi was 🐀
[2022-12-10 11:23:26] <%bgeorgiev9622> You are so lucky, Marcos cannot score against Croatia

[2022-12-10 11:23:40] <%zodiac1455> I think yesterday 6-7 player could have sent off, including Messi. Am I the only one who noticed that Weghorst after his first goal kicked Messi, and he should received his second yellow... :D
[2022-12-10 11:23:42] <faisalkhan1029> Dimaaaa magrheeeb
[2022-12-10 11:23:44] <+elias3031> I dont think messi would get the second yellow if he already had a yellow
[2022-12-10 11:23:45] <$maplepoolfc> Very disciplined Morocco
[2022-12-10 11:23:45] <stlmrcool> To be honest both teams are equal but the difference is Messi is the big change

[2022-12-10 11:25:21] <%$frankiebaby178> england has a great squad but they just 2 cocky act like they own football
[2022-12-10 11:25:23] <On_The_Edge_09> they're just unlucky to face france. Just can't imagine the go past them
[2022-12-10 11:25:23] <KroesRoes> Maguire MOTM for stopping Mbappe

[2022-12-10 11:27:19] <danielbloy> Modric is the real goat
[2022-12-10 11:27:20] <%$frankiebaby178> croatia has a good squad but the coach is awful
[2022-12-10 11:27:21] <Stonecooold12> @godparticale It’s hard to explain that’s why
[2022-12-10 11:27:21] <Jay_dub00> No snow here
[2022-12-10 11:27:23] <gurraisvibin> Modric future stars

[2022-12-10 11:27:49] <+theWTFkid> imagine playing fifa and losing after your opponent only had 1 shot on goal and you had 11 LUL LUL LUL
[2022-12-10 11:27:49] <tdog_g> croatia have the best midfield in the tournament with brozovic, modric and kovacic
[2022-12-10 11:27:51] <@%Paddeinho> With a big striker you would have a sick team
[2022-12-10 11:27:52] <mlyisback> Morocco 😍😍 much love from there 😉

[2022-12-10 11:28:54] <+lucstensen> The ref was a joke, messi should be off @MatosPlays

[2022-12-10 11:29:13] <mymanenjoy> It is, nobody attacks if there is golden goal, they play it even more safe and boring

[2022-12-10 11:29:15] <!WONDERS_X_> it was strange to not play it

[2022-12-10 11:29:36] <@%Speyto> NO
[2022-12-10 11:29:36] <x96er> modric is still not appreciated enough imo
[2022-12-10 11:29:38] <melihenry> I enjoyed that win because Sweden somehow snuck past Nigeria(my country) in the group stages...I was pissed
[2022-12-10 11:29:38] <!WONDERS_X_> they'll do it
[2022-12-10 11:29:39] <@%Mintees1> This isnt nfl thats why
[2022-12-10 11:29:40] <@%Speyto> Never
[2022-12-10 11:29:40] <HashtagLegion> like NBA
[2022-12-10 11:29:41] <%zodiac1455> I agree
[2022-12-10 11:29:41] <vore1os> yeeeeap 100% like basket
[2022-12-10 11:29:42] <@%Mintees1> They do added time
[2022-12-10 11:29:44] <%gordon0227> LUL the match will be 4hours
[2022-12-10 11:29:49] <Stonecooold12> @bgeorgiev9622 Yet it probably be France parking waiting for pace abuse, and England going for 0-0 thinking it’s still group stages
[2022-12-10 11:29:50] <%$frankiebaby178> not bad idea tbh
[2022-12-10 11:29:52] <mymanenjoy> I'd give players 3-5sec to take a free kick after the whistle is blown, otherwise a yellow
[2022-12-10 11:29:52] <MatosPlays> @lucstensen if he got a yellow for handball they wouldn’t have gave him another for the foul
[2022-12-10 11:29:56] <lucguldager> Active time like futsal
[2022-12-10 11:29:57] <Gazza74mufc19> in rugby league, the ref stops the clock....not fkn hard!!
[2022-12-10 11:29:59] <nikkhil18> so true
[2022-12-10 11:30:00] <Jakobz27> florball
[2022-12-10 11:30:00] <%bgeorgiev9622> the game will be too long
[2022-12-10 11:30:05] <@%Mintees1> Football is unique KEKW
[2022-12-10 11:30:06] <%Shaka2hot> Isn’t that how they get the added time?
[2022-12-10 11:30:06] <%decembercreep96> stopping the clock will give way to advertising multiple breaks on tv
[2022-12-10 11:30:07] <%$proudmancs1> if they stopped the clock in football it would take 3 hours to play a match
[2022-12-10 11:30:09] <HashtagLegion> in Egg Hand as well
[2022-12-10 11:30:10] <mrrobo19> dont they have like extra ref now in wc that does that off game and thats why we have so much extra time?

[2022-12-10 11:30:17] <thelonglegsdwarf> the game would last 3 hours then

[2022-12-10 11:30:22] <zejd1234> have you heard about Silver goal in 2003?
[2022-12-10 11:30:23] <@%Paddeinho> Would be more accurate to stop the clock then adding time
[2022-12-10 11:30:23] <@%Speyto> Other sports aren't as popular as football either

[2022-12-10 11:30:32] <vore1os> still the best sport out there 😂 @BorasLegend
[2022-12-10 11:30:36] <McSauce1> Then they would blow at 90, even in a attack
[2022-12-10 11:30:37] <siniture> that Mateo lahoz fraud wanted Messi out so bad but failed
[2022-12-10 11:30:40] <thelonglegsdwarf> ball goes out of play a lot, plus a lot of fouls
[2022-12-10 11:30:40] <storkebab> The sport would be more intense if we had effective playtime
[2022-12-10 11:30:41] <@%Mintees1> They will still waste
[2022-12-10 11:30:45] <Gazza74mufc19> it's an excuse to give extra mins in case the team they want to win are behind imo
[2022-12-10 11:30:46] <nikkhil18> but there still isnt because of added time
[2022-12-10 11:30:46] <%$proudmancs1> an average game of football the ball is in play for just 50 mins of a game
[2022-12-10 11:30:51] <+thomas_w04> thats so boring to watch aswell
[2022-12-10 11:30:53] <%noktaZeee> @StinsonBaba turkey cant even qual to world since then so we learn u guys get worse apperantly
[2022-12-10 11:30:55] <@%Paddeinho> yeah just stop the clock when ball is not in play
[2022-12-10 11:30:56] <Sink__> @BorasLegend 30min and clock stop
[2022-12-10 11:30:56] <@%Paddeinho> easy
[2022-12-10 11:30:59] <musktzetze> they would still waste time bro it's in their DNA just like diving :))
[2022-12-10 11:31:01] <%zodiac1455> I think VAR would be better, if each team had 2-3 chances to stop the play at questionable situations...
[2022-12-10 11:31:01] <$rratzoi> @McSauce1 exaclty, just like basketball
[2022-12-10 11:31:01] <$cjankowy> I love football I feel like behind in implementing things like video review and clock stopping
[2022-12-10 11:31:02] <@%Paddeinho> makes more sense
[2022-12-10 11:31:04] <sodowodo25> faking injury has become a necessary skill for footballers now lol

[2022-12-10 11:31:07] <mymanenjoy> They are mostly diving to give some rest to themselves and others, if they knew they have unlimited time everybody would lie down for x sec to have some rest for him and the team
[2022-12-10 11:31:07] <psilocydreams> It makes a difference, you can waste time to slow down the game
[2022-12-10 11:31:09] <@%goodvibeviking> they do it to kill the momentum/energy of the game
[2022-12-10 11:31:12] <%bgeorgiev9622> the better teams have over 50-55 minutes in game times so that's  enough
[2022-12-10 11:31:17] <%+punshus> they are aware then that it doesnt benefit them

[2022-12-10 11:31:28] <tdog_g> that would encourage really boring passing around the back football though when people want to time waste

[2022-12-10 11:51:21] <VibessFC> kovacic modric brozovic what a midfield trio my god
[2022-12-10 11:51:31] <midghost_> If Moutinho were coach of Croatia, he would be perfect, the coach and the team that practices anti-football.
[2022-12-10 11:51:36] <%+E90Bear> El Capitan upgrade is hopefully good
[2022-12-10 11:51:36] <+thomas_w04> its gotten more tactical

[2022-12-10 11:51:38] <!WONDERS_X_> sorry but Croatia now not underdog anymore
[2022-12-10 11:51:44] <Dejex_> Different passion from Croatia
[2022-12-10 11:51:45] <%$frankiebaby178> its harded to defend than attack

[2022-12-10 11:52:18] <Neshfox> Teams play a style thats the gives them the best chances of winning, teams arent just going to open up and make it easy for the other team play their game.

[2022-12-10 11:52:22] <mymanenjoy> Croatia is really similar to Real Madrid, they play to their strengths
[2022-12-10 11:52:27] <Jay_dub00> Croatia have always been a good footballing nation. Small yes but look at the players they have produced over the years
[2022-12-10 11:52:28] <diehardnutria23> @weecody_ coz they didnt deserve it
[2022-12-10 11:52:30] <%$Polus_11> You are saying the same thing over and over again @boraslegend
[2022-12-10 11:52:36] <Dejex_> Totally agree with you
[2022-12-10 11:52:37] <+kingjames13bosca> neymar deserved to win
[2022-12-10 11:52:39] <%st_dani1712> as results of course.. as gameplay...
[2022-12-10 11:52:40] <+blackcoats76> I was proud of Australia making it out of the group we don’t have stars but our team plays 100% and have passion in our supporters
[2022-12-10 11:52:41] <MoneymanMatip> Yesterday’s match was a tactical masterclass by Croatia
[2022-12-10 11:52:41] <!%+arnold_1105> Exactly
[2022-12-10 11:52:42] <VibessFC> croatia midfield is insane
[2022-12-10 11:52:44] <storkebab> miss Mandzukic
[2022-12-10 11:52:46] <+thomas_w04> @mymanenjoy yeah they got the ice and the winner mentality too
[2022-12-10 11:52:47] <serenity_epk> South Korea tried and just looked naive when the result goes that bad
[2022-12-10 11:52:51] <sezontwitch> expecting croatia to play like a team like france is like expecting west brom to play like man city
[2022-12-10 11:52:52] <eye4dtails> Messi and Cr7 turning into @ssholes.
[2022-12-10 11:52:57] <+plebalertx> @weecody_ L take, brazil should get better at taking pens LUL

[2022-12-10 11:53:06] <%+stefan940> isnt croatia population around 4 mil?
[2022-12-10 11:53:06] <AzzaFizzy> modric best midfielder of all time
[2022-12-10 11:53:09] <@%Paddeinho> Sick game yesterday

[2022-12-10 11:53:20] <%Shaka2hot> But it’s not about quantity though
[2022-12-10 11:53:27] <wendyyyyyy_> making top 4 back to back is not luck

[2022-12-10 11:53:38] <dominikacer> Croatia less than 4mln people, crazy football nation
[2022-12-10 11:53:49] <%+watf_dno> ejjj kolega we did it if only we had srbijas attack omg world cup done !!!!!

[2022-12-10 11:54:01] <elluis03> Funny story, I was just looking on Futbin Mbappe. noticed I was short 150k. open the 2 gold card pack I had and pack him lol.

[2022-12-10 11:54:11] <GamepadRider> Croatia having more passes than Brazil says alot
[2022-12-10 11:54:13] <+TigerRTX> YOU GUYS ONLY WON CAUSE OVERrated alisson man dude didnt stop a single ball
[2022-12-10 11:54:19] <%+xbertssmiler> if they win wc it is the biggest upset, but greece 2004 is still on top imo
[2022-12-10 11:54:20] <@%Paddeinho> Would be a great underdog final :D

Things got worse in 2014, but this year our confidence was sky high. Anyways… This is football, and that is why I love this game! Now, let’s hope for a final of dreams, to represent the end of our generation: Arg x Por
