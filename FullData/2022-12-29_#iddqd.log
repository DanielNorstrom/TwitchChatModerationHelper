[2022-12-29 08:07:53] <%fawtetaa> oh thats cool
[2022-12-29 08:08:05] <%fawtetaa> like, google forms type of stuff?
[2022-12-29 08:08:16] <@%daisy82078> possibly.

[2022-12-29 08:08:29] <%fawtetaa> helps you out a lot i think
[2022-12-29 08:08:40] <%fawtetaa> u must get a ton of submissions

[2022-12-29 08:08:57] <@%daisy82078> Yep..lol
[2022-12-29 08:09:44] <%fawtetaa> do u have any idea if replay codes expire?
[2022-12-29 08:10:15] <%fawtetaa> the games says the replays reset every patch, but idk about the share codes
[2022-12-29 08:10:51] <%fawtetaa> thats kinda of a problem if the list get too long maybe
[2022-12-29 08:11:23] <@%daisy82078> That is true. Not sure about the length of the code.  Guess people could resubmit a new code. LOL
[2022-12-29 08:11:44] <%fawtetaa> yeah, i googled it
[2022-12-29 08:11:49] <%fawtetaa> every major patch it resets
[2022-12-29 08:12:33] <%fawtetaa> but i dont think its gonna be a problem actually
[2022-12-29 08:12:42] <%fawtetaa> next patch is not due so early
[2022-12-29 08:13:09] <%fawtetaa> and we have only 1 more week of educational (for now iddSit )
[2022-12-29 08:13:45] <@%daisy82078> That is true. So, we should be good for now at least.

[2022-12-29 10:06:08] <BormahTiid> Orisa not being able to get pushed back hurts her against Hog Ult

[2022-12-29 10:07:14] <%tuberosum_> push him to ur team. xd
[2022-12-29 10:07:27] <BormahTiid> Ideally as Orisa she wants to be in his face the whole time aside from Whole Hog
[2022-12-29 10:07:37] <%+gomattzilla> is their dps targeting the support?
[2022-12-29 10:07:44] <%ZER0CIOUS> dont do that if he has hook tho, right?
[2022-12-29 10:07:47] <BerserkerGatsu> so fortify to get around him and then spinny from behind

[2022-12-29 10:59:47] <eff0rt_ow> @mirasweetheart can u even do a full 360 if u dont lift ur mouse
[2022-12-29 10:59:54] <morfeanath> I'm thinking gold because 50% of the lobby should be gold at the highest, but Mira could be anywhere from gold to diamond and I wouldn't bat an eye.

[2022-12-29 11:01:28] <%+mirasweetheart> i should look in my dpi tbh, i have no clue what my dpi is.
[2022-12-29 11:01:29] <%KiraisGod> that is really low you should up that for sure

[2022-12-29 11:01:45] <geno69> I think is better to use crazy high sens on mercy
[2022-12-29 11:01:49] <%Volker73> maybe 800 dpi instead of 400 that would make more sense
[2022-12-29 11:01:50] <Fablier> Susge
[2022-12-29 11:01:52] <NaxoHaxor> it could be 800 dpi

[2022-12-29 11:24:37] <%+mirasweetheart> Well @iddqd i was in OW1 a plat/Gold i even toughed in season 4 i belive Masters with Mercy only.
[2022-12-29 11:24:39] <%+TSgtSeuss> The Moira pick was a clue that it was below Plat, the Mercy movement and nobody playing Sojourn made me think it was below Gold... Couldn't tell between Silver and Bronze, so I guessed

[2022-12-29 13:14:28] <Reignus> I don't see how you can consider F2P as relevant in any way when both LoL and Dota 2 are both F2P models

[2022-12-29 13:15:24] <+Rodrigoxxxxxxx> HE SAID its free and not competitive. and to enjoy with friends
[2022-12-29 13:15:30] <Reignus> Th point was about the competitiveness of OW, and that F2P has culpability in that
[2022-12-29 13:15:53] <shruggy08> i wouldn't agree with that csgo had f2p
[2022-12-29 13:15:57] <%+sliime69420> i dont add many randos but i added him bc i played with or against him lot
[2022-12-29 13:16:03] <SirTryhard7> You’re def right
[2022-12-29 13:16:04] <@%BillThePenguino> also they are moba formats
[2022-12-29 13:16:13] <@%BillThePenguino> MOBA are never casual
[2022-12-29 13:16:21] <@%BillThePenguino> where as shooters can be casual
[2022-12-29 13:16:25] <Scumbag_Brad> @sliime69420 pretty sure its a default blizzard name so theyre probably different people
[2022-12-29 13:16:28] <SirTryhard7> @sliime69420 ya, same. I’ve added a few lately
[2022-12-29 13:16:33] <Ag3L3s> It’s Not Competitive and It’s almost brainless shoot whoever pick whoever and The Match Obj is almost Irrelevant
[2022-12-29 13:16:40] <Zeirem> Sounds rigged
[2022-12-29 13:16:42] <SirTryhard7> Ohh good point LUL
[2022-12-29 13:16:46] <AtaQC> I've been loosing 90% of games even though I do always best in my team and overall in games
[2022-12-29 13:16:58] <AtaQC> system feels like total bullshit
[2022-12-29 13:16:58] <Scumbag_Brad> like hiddensquid
[2022-12-29 13:17:00] <Ag3L3s> Factz Hot Garbage
[2022-12-29 13:17:01] <Reignus> True, many of the systems are bad for competitve play. But I don't think F2P is at fault for that. Or it SHOULDNT be the cause
[2022-12-29 13:17:01] <Scumbag_Brad> u see a lot of those
[2022-12-29 13:17:06] <SirTryhard7> Most games are already like that SeemsGood
[2022-12-29 13:17:09] <xetehx> wait where can you find this match maker info

[2022-12-29 13:17:18] <%sherwin_fernandes> @AtaQC happened to me yesterday lost 8 games in a row in 1 hour
[2022-12-29 13:17:22] <Curios1tyy> idd has goodd points
[2022-12-29 13:17:25] <shruggy08> yeah i agree
[2022-12-29 13:17:27] <%+Ddosvictim> so pushing towards 5% winrate makes sense
[2022-12-29 13:17:30] <+Bold_Star> @AtaQC skill issue
[2022-12-29 13:17:30] <%Chevyrebel79> That literally makes it hard to climb if they make it 50/50 winrate. You win too many and then you're against 2 ranks above you
[2022-12-29 13:17:33] <%CHICKEN2XD> If balance team is not looking at characters by a competitive standpoint the game is not competitive
[2022-12-29 13:17:42] <+RAmanXII> All match making systems relying on a Skill Based Match making push for a 50% win. Only the best and the worst players will fall outside of that.
[2022-12-29 13:17:51] <%AxisZtv> and NO CASUALS PLAY RANKED... like 2/3rds of the player base only play casuals
[2022-12-29 13:17:53] <%+sliime69420> ii may be wrong but this is my bud
[2022-12-29 13:17:58] <SirTryhard7> Felt so
[2022-12-29 13:17:59] <%AxisZtv> idk why they changed ranked
[2022-12-29 13:18:00] <shruggy08> yeah and i feel the majority is more casual no?
[2022-12-29 13:18:10] <%+NyoXandrian> iddqd is #1 elite NOTED
[2022-12-29 13:18:13] <spiderrandomnumber> F2p is NOT the reason for a less competitive environment, but it goes in the same direction and has the same origin
[2022-12-29 13:18:17] <Dracksar> I believe i know what you are saying AYAYA
[2022-12-29 13:18:17] <%+sliime69420> ITS MADE FOR ME

[2022-12-29 13:18:41] <%BIGCHUNGUSZERO> it does seem like all of the changes they make aim to lower the barrier to entry to play the game

[2022-12-29 13:36:15] <5headbilly> My favorite character is the reaper guy. he is very powerfull. special move, honestly is one of the best in the game and so he comes equipped with these two revolvers and only takes about 3 or 4 shots to actually execute a kill so it comes really in handy specially when you come from the side.

[2022-12-29 14:11:30] <Tyroar> Playing Diablo 2 remastered and switching between the graphic style is so eye opening on what was groundbreaking at the time.

[2022-12-29 14:11:45] <%nannakki> that is why there was that much hype for the movie

[2022-12-29 14:12:04] <BakedZnake> swotor does amazing cinematics, just bad at making the game
[2022-12-29 14:12:04] <r3vol8> maybe only old time Square cinematic came close

[2022-12-29 14:45:59] <%Kingen34> @newbie173 well I was thinking whether it is better to have higher dpi and low in game sens or low dpi and high in game sens. I just can't wrap my head around what the difference is
[2022-12-29 14:46:05] <+aj7continue> even with a mercy, it's good to have that mindset
[2022-12-29 14:46:15] <%xfishyfishx> @Kingen34 depends on your monitor resolution

[2022-12-29 14:46:39] <%WolfIsBad_> @kingen34 I think technically a higher dpi with low in game is better but it's a very minimal difference
[2022-12-29 14:46:40] <Vaizel88> Anyone experienced really buggy noises in ow replay the more you skip and after a lot of skips you cant hear literally anything besides buzzy noises?
[2022-12-29 14:46:51] <%WindyInu> @WolfIsBad_ yes
[2022-12-29 14:46:58] <gtFD___> @Kingen34 the difference is nothing, dont go too extreme values and you are ok
[2022-12-29 14:47:06] <BlackSiilv3r> @Kingen34 you want more control go lower dpi, you want more responsive go higher dpi

[2022-12-29 14:48:00] <wonkymonky_> @Kingen34 high dpi gives you slightly better input latency, diminishing returns past 1600dpi though, otherwise, no benefits
[2022-12-29 14:48:10] <%xfishyfishx> @Kingen34 look up in Google Overwatch DPI Tool
[2022-12-29 14:48:20] <newbie173> extremely low dpi when using desktop is just atrocious.. try find "normal" dpi for you (dont go too high or too low)

[2022-12-29 15:35:40] <%Nubbinsss> Aiming in OW is more about predictability rather than core aim

[2022-12-29 15:36:01] <%TacticalPew> I got better in kovaaks after practicing aim in OW KEKW

[2022-12-29 15:37:00] <PainkillerDCXVI> oh that's easy, it's hard to aim in overwatch... way too intense and non stop aiming
[2022-12-29 15:37:10] <PainkillerDCXVI> you never stop aiming and shooting
[2022-12-29 15:37:15] <tsoumbas> @iddqd headshots in OW varies from character thats why its more skilled aim
[2022-12-29 15:37:20] <%strichz> OW has no target acceleration so you can just spam ADAD
