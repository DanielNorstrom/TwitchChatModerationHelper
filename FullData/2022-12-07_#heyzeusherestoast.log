[2022-12-07 18:04:47] <bugsbunny_xd> @Minmatar0 Bad weapons dont exist
[2022-12-07 18:04:49] <%+Minmatar0> I think its good but you know min maxers bro.
[2022-12-07 18:04:50] <%Warbr3ak3r> I'm a classic claymore fan LUL
[2022-12-07 18:04:57] <%$DwayneAtSundown> i used the flamberge for quite some time in my first playthrough
[2022-12-07 18:05:03] <Zaphod_____> @Minmatar0 only bad users
[2022-12-07 18:05:06] <%$DwayneAtSundown> really liked the running attack
[2022-12-07 18:05:13] <%$goodguypatches> East (slightly North too) of the Raya Lucaria building...so across the lake there is a butt looking thing on the map. That's the tunnel. There is another tunnel to the North of the lake too but that brings you across to Altus Plateu without the elevator
[2022-12-07 18:05:34] <%$DwayneAtSundown> the giant snails really creep me out
[2022-12-07 18:05:40] <%Blog_12345> the difference is the claymore has a charged thrust R2 in this one
[2022-12-07 18:05:43] <%+Minmatar0> i used this until i found the greatsword. both were good
[2022-12-07 18:05:55] <%Warbr3ak3r> that was a nasty trap

[2022-12-07 18:08:20] <%twolf004> @nwmn420 I wish. I have a 2 year old and a marriage that needs work put into it
[2022-12-07 18:08:55] <%Warbr3ak3r> Man, I platinumed BB, played DS3, DeS remake, Nioh, Sekiro, but somehow I'm so scared of ER
[2022-12-07 18:08:59] <%$goodguypatches> @twolf004 same. I also have a 9 month old who requires all my Elden Ring time
[2022-12-07 18:09:20] <%Warbr3ak3r> I feel ER is just too big, would drive me crazy, and so much BS happening at times
[2022-12-07 18:09:26] <+bokchoylau> planning on doing a second run in elden ring with the walmart whirligig saw
[2022-12-07 18:09:45] <%twolf004> @goodguypatches don't ya just wish you had time to do everything as much as you want. friggin responsibilities
[2022-12-07 18:09:45] <+ornamentalpotat0> I need this helmet LUL
[2022-12-07 18:09:46] <%$goodguypatches> @Warbr3ak3r It's actually not too bad to plat. BB was way harder IMO. DS1 was the worst of the lot
[2022-12-07 18:09:50] <%$nickowl12> dude my dog burps SO much. and we asked the vet just in case cuz he doesnt eat too fast and who knows. but she was like yeah he just burps a lot

[2022-12-07 18:10:19] <%$goodguypatches> @twolf004 I know. When they fall asleep a little tear comes to my eye and I run to the PS5
[2022-12-07 18:10:20] <$Paethgoat> @Warbr3ak3r I platinumed DS 1-3, BB, and ER twice.  ER has the most quality of life improvements and allows for the most flexible choices
[2022-12-07 18:10:20] <%$DwayneAtSundown> a lot of enemies have questionable reach
[2022-12-07 18:10:32] <%$nickowl12> he looks like a muppet or a person in a costume hes so big and stands up so straight
[2022-12-07 18:10:47] <%$nickowl12> hes a generally hilarious creature
[2022-12-07 18:11:06] <%$goodguypatches> It's one of the more fun fights I think. He's a bit manic but fun
[2022-12-07 18:11:16] <%thewal1ofsleep> love the snails
[2022-12-07 18:11:17] <%+DadBeard4> I love the bloodhound dude - so tough to predict some times
[2022-12-07 18:11:44] <%twolf004> @goodguypatches you ever get nap trapped when they fall asleep on you. and ya love it. but you also just wish you could go play on your ps5
[2022-12-07 18:11:46] <%$goodguypatches> great rolling

[2022-12-07 18:13:20] <sp_dv> you also finished the game already and you fight this exact enemy 7 times @heyZeusHeresToast
[2022-12-07 18:13:20] <%$goodguypatches> this is the absolute best way to play. You get so much out of your games and come out a much better player

[2022-12-07 18:14:18] <+bokchoylau> find the albinauric woman
[2022-12-07 18:14:32] <%$burnsbadwhenipee> I think lobo means wolf in some language, I might be wrong
[2022-12-07 18:14:43] <buterbasil> it makes your rune curved
[2022-12-07 18:14:43] <%$DwayneAtSundown> lets you use the power of a great rune
[2022-12-07 18:14:45] <NiceCombo> i think it is similar to humanity in dark souls
[2022-12-07 18:14:47] <%$goodguypatches> you use the boss souls for extra power
[2022-12-07 18:14:47] <%Warbr3ak3r> Lobo is wolf in spanish
[2022-12-07 18:14:47] <%beaye___> Actives great your great rube
[2022-12-07 18:14:49] <+bokchoylau> it activates your great rune equipped

[2022-12-07 18:15:07] <%$nickowl12> @burnsbadwhenipee youre right but just saying itd be cool if it was a nod to lobos
[2022-12-07 18:15:11] <%narcolepsy___> ember effigy
[2022-12-07 18:15:11] <%$goodguypatches> the rune arc allows you to use that boss power after you die
[2022-12-07 18:15:11] <%$CharlesZane> Isn't it a dildo?
[2022-12-07 18:15:12] <%$burnsbadwhenipee> @nickowl12 very true
[2022-12-07 18:15:14] <%$goodguypatches> that's the tunnel
[2022-12-07 18:15:15] <%$justin6ix9> Buffs your stats or gives you something that helps you
