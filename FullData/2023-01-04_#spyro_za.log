[2023-01-04 09:47:20] <@%+Godfather_AL> so you decided this over moogic the googlioni KappaHD
[2023-01-04 09:47:21] <DStr8KillenEm> so it's movement st vs monsters
[2023-01-04 09:47:22] <devilord100> hi spyro, why we playing on this?
[2023-01-04 09:47:28] <dalmnation> it's RNG I think

[2023-01-04 09:47:39] VIEWERS: 128
[2023-01-04 09:47:44] <Zentimuz> A lot of locations mess with movement decks
[2023-01-04 09:47:51] <zzarathustra87> namor with move cards ar wrong!
[2023-01-04 09:48:07] <%+reryaa> you know your true friends are if they try to join your bandwagon KEKL
[2023-01-04 09:48:07] <Ezras> @spyro_za 88 locations counting the ones that will be added to this season
[2023-01-04 09:48:12] <Capichedoo> !namor
[2023-01-04 09:48:13] <@%+Godfather_AL> cards are so small on screen, they need to improve that, move those buttons and avatars to the side
[2023-01-04 09:48:14] <Zentimuz> destroy and ongoing in early pool are more flexible towards locations
[2023-01-04 09:48:18] <@%zubedoo> ok in some time he will join and we can type !cardname and it will work
[2023-01-04 09:48:22] <@%zubedoo> @Capichedoo takes a bit
[2023-01-04 09:48:39] <Capichedoo> @zubedoo is the bot's brain lagging
[2023-01-04 09:48:58] <Basmal> EZGAEM
[2023-01-04 09:49:00] <DStr8KillenEm> I'd remove the movement and add more ongoing with spectrum as the 6e
[2023-01-04 09:49:03] <+miltoff> you can match the screen so we can see your deck as well
[2023-01-04 09:49:06] <@%zubedoo> catJAM
[2023-01-04 09:49:07] <+miltoff> there is an option for that
[2023-01-04 09:49:10] <Zentimuz> Do you have Carnage? @spyro_za Destroy Dino Moongirl is solid you might have it
[2023-01-04 09:49:11] <RaunoSaul> so glad you quit gwent Kreygasm
[2023-01-04 09:49:12] <%+reryaa> Snapping just doubling the stakes on the turn?

[2023-01-04 09:57:40] <%crander47> Killmonger is a solid tech card because you can also use it to trigger stuff on your side of the board or get credits towards death
[2023-01-04 09:58:00] <DStr8KillenEm> killmonger and doggo best techs
[2023-01-04 09:58:01] <sir_deadpoool> hood kinda cards can be sacrificed in vormir

[2023-01-04 10:20:46] <DStr8KillenEm> you spend gold to refresh missions

[2023-01-04 10:20:54] <%crander47> That's a location for Darkhawk
[2023-01-04 10:21:05] <+RoaringHillock> you're hyped because you're finally free of a toxic relationship with GWONT
[2023-01-04 10:21:07] <Zentimuz> any hyper snappers in the chat?
[2023-01-04 10:21:09] <Huhino_> its because you are not playing gwont Kapp
[2023-01-04 10:21:12] <TlkParadox> Because the 1drop would have made dino drop to 7 power, meaning he would no longer have been the strongest card for the throne and oppo would have won the middle location
[2023-01-04 10:21:22] <%+fistman13> ah fml ok sry
[2023-01-04 10:21:42] <sir_deadpoool> hulk buster with multiple man and doctor strange combo provides good buff

[2023-01-04 10:28:48] <@%zubedoo> if you are going to spend money just go for battle pass
[2023-01-04 10:28:50] <agent_182> don't buy gold
[2023-01-04 10:28:52] <Ezras> in battle pass tab
[2023-01-04 10:28:55] <+drunkbonjovi> you need to finish first pass
[2023-01-04 10:28:58] <%+Benelioto> battle pass is best value
[2023-01-04 10:29:02] <bogdankhmelnitski> Does this game have fullscreen?
[2023-01-04 10:29:02] <+drunkbonjovi> and than you can buy new one
[2023-01-04 10:29:12] <agent_182> complete first then
[2023-01-04 10:29:13] <+Rasscall> finish this one first

[2023-01-04 10:29:25] <Wizller20> this is the beginner pass, this one is free
[2023-01-04 10:29:25] <+miltoff> then u can buy battle pass with zabu
[2023-01-04 10:29:26] <Ezras> yes this is tutorial pass
[2023-01-04 10:29:31] <sir_deadpoool> if you see leader in your token store pin it

[2023-01-04 10:33:00] <+Rasscall> pool 1 have moongirl copy your hand
[2023-01-04 10:33:01] <Ezras> that way Dino comes down on 6
[2023-01-04 10:33:08] <DStr8KillenEm> the real trick to getting infinite rank is keeping you collection level below pool 3

[2023-01-04 10:37:43] <agent_182> if it's a common english name it's a bot
[2023-01-04 10:37:43] <beefbufff> Spyro Snap!!!
[2023-01-04 10:37:44] <Zentimuz> generic names like David
[2023-01-04 10:37:50] <TlkParadox> Common avatar, shitty plays and common first name as nicknames
[2023-01-04 10:38:00] <Ezras> another way is to emote and see if they emote back @spyro_za

[2023-01-04 10:38:49] <agent_182> snap turn till you reach rank 50 @spyro_za
[2023-01-04 10:38:56] <agent_182> turn 1 *
[2023-01-04 10:39:07] <DStr8KillenEm> opponent deck had no gameplan
[2023-01-04 10:39:18] <hyperion100> why do you have kazar in your deck
[2023-01-04 10:39:28] <Ezras> @spyro_za take a guess how many snap games you can do compared to 1 game of Gwent LUL
[2023-01-04 10:39:33] <DStr8KillenEm> it's a free moongirl
[2023-01-04 10:39:51] <Zentimuz> Kazan is in deck cause he’s new and enjoying the game CoolCat
[2023-01-04 10:40:04] VIEWERS: 193
[2023-01-04 10:40:06] <%sp1cy_gr> Not all the cards have abilities? and if you upgrade them you get new ones?
[2023-01-04 10:40:09] <%+rotello1> what if he plays killmonger and kills your dreams MyAvatar
[2023-01-04 10:40:40] <Zentimuz> It’s 100% for me 25% of the time CoolCat
[2023-01-04 10:40:54] <%+salamander8701> Danger room kills 100% of my units, and 0% of my opponents
[2023-01-04 10:41:04] <beefbufff> only difference between mad and glad is GL
[2023-01-04 10:41:26] <DStr8KillenEm> engine deck kek
[2023-01-04 10:41:34] <Zentimuz> But when I put Bucky it doesn’t 25% me TearGlove
[2023-01-04 10:41:51] <dalmnation> strange goes first
[2023-01-04 10:41:55] <Zentimuz> No, reveal happened first

[2023-01-04 10:42:20] <beefbufff> sunspot reminds me a card from other card game made once by cdpr
[2023-01-04 10:42:21] <Zentimuz> sun shot resolves last
[2023-01-04 10:42:32] <beefbufff> Sunspot is Kolgrim
[2023-01-04 10:43:00] <Zentimuz> I said last, reveal happens before locations effects
[2023-01-04 10:43:33] <DStr8KillenEm> bricked rocket time to snap
[2023-01-04 10:43:54] <Zentimuz> Strange is reveal so it’ll move the highest unit first then the Sunshots will boost after

[2023-01-04 10:44:33] <%crander47> Namor is pretty good in pool 1
[2023-01-04 10:44:40] <%crander47> not good outside of it though
[2023-01-04 10:44:41] <Ezras> when hobgoblin becomes a thing for you Namor is very bad
[2023-01-04 10:44:54] <hyperion100> namor in general isnt a good card
[2023-01-04 10:45:03] <Ezras> point proven LUL
[2023-01-04 10:45:16] <Zentimuz> replacing Namor with Moongirl gives more points in deck
[2023-01-04 10:45:18] <Ezras> I called it before it happens KappaHD
[2023-01-04 10:45:26] <sir_deadpoool> retreat
[2023-01-04 10:45:41] <%crander47> You should retreat
[2023-01-04 10:45:58] <hyperion100> donate 8 cubes in bronze, not good enough for snap LUL

[2023-01-04 10:46:30] <%crander47> If you were not playing a bot you would have lost lol
[2023-01-04 10:46:31] <Ezras> snap actually requiring thinking
[2023-01-04 10:46:34] <hyperion100> you will donate so many cubes in the future

[2023-01-04 10:46:58] <hyperion100> snap is a game where you need to toss your ego
[2023-01-04 10:47:02] <Zentimuz> Try swapping Kazar or Namor with Moongirl
[2023-01-04 10:47:03] <hyperion100> otherwise ull be donating
[2023-01-04 10:47:04] <afel100> wait this game isnt pvp?
[2023-01-04 10:47:17] <%+salamander8701> If we learned one thing from gwent, it’s never pass
[2023-01-04 10:47:30] <hyperion100> totally different game from gwent
[2023-01-04 10:47:34] <dalmnation> it is, just that there are a lot of bots in low ranks @afel100
[2023-01-04 10:47:34] <%+salamander8701> @afel100 it is, but there are a lot of bots also

[2023-01-04 10:48:41] <hyperion100> this game is all about snapping when you have the nuts and retreating when you dont
[2023-01-04 10:48:59] <DStr8KillenEm> he expects you to not have cards with good abilities
[2023-01-04 10:49:20] <hyperion100> winrate doesnt matter as much, only cubes gained for each match
[2023-01-04 10:49:34] <ichlibitiche> can u explain the game to us HeyGuys

[2023-01-04 10:57:38] <afel100> how do you get cards here, i mean it is easy like in gwent or do you have to grind?
[2023-01-04 10:57:42] <inther4> namor good for early level
[2023-01-04 10:57:50] <hyperion100> it makes them retreat
[2023-01-04 10:57:53] <beefbufff> it gives you dominance
[2023-01-04 10:58:01] <Ezras> @afel100 it's a grind they don't give you the best cards right away
[2023-01-04 10:58:02] <agent_182> if they retreat early they lose 2 cubes
[2023-01-04 10:58:04] <%RC_Sev> What does a snap do
[2023-01-04 10:58:09] VIEWERS: 205
[2023-01-04 10:58:10] <Ezras> makes it more balanced for newer players
[2023-01-04 10:58:11] <Zentimuz> turn one snap if you have your ideal hand it’s normally a bluff and risky
[2023-01-04 10:58:14] <DarkGheed> bc all of them are bots Kappa
[2023-01-04 10:58:23] <agent_182> people retreat early higher rank

[2023-01-04 10:58:27] <%sp1cy_gr> Snap to bluff?
[2023-01-04 10:58:30] <afel100> @Ezras but i guess you can just buy like kegs or somethink?
[2023-01-04 10:58:30] <%crander47> To be honest if someone early snaps and you don't have a good hand you should retreat, early snapping is generally just a good way to lose cubes
[2023-01-04 10:58:45] <%crander47> Unless your hand is really good
[2023-01-04 10:58:57] <%+rotello1> you snap before reavling a strong play.
[2023-01-04 10:59:00] <%RC_Sev> Are cubes an alternative to mmr?
[2023-01-04 10:59:06] <agent_182> yepp
[2023-01-04 10:59:08] <Ezras> @afel100 no buying just gets you up the ladder faster for a chance at new cards not guaranteeing a certain card
[2023-01-04 10:59:17] <agent_182> think of snapping as wagering
[2023-01-04 10:59:20] <afel100> got it
[2023-01-04 10:59:21] <%+rotello1> there is no right or wrong turn to snap, it depends on the game.
[2023-01-04 10:59:22] <agent_182> double
[2023-01-04 10:59:30] <Zentimuz> yeah but good hand then you see terrible anti synergy location reveal and you’re stuck losing 2 cubes
[2023-01-04 10:59:42] <Ezras> damn

[2023-01-04 11:43:17] <Zentimuz> which is why too heavy cost units like klaw and namar are too pricy

[2023-01-04 11:44:53] <inther4> increase dino draw like 4% each turn
[2023-01-04 11:45:00] <%crander47> It helps you turn 1-5 draws
[2023-01-04 11:45:05] <Skrzyps1998> it's adding consistence
[2023-01-04 11:45:18] <Zentimuz> plus a solid power too

[2023-01-04 12:20:42] <+7h3g3ntl3m4n> don tplay card
[2023-01-04 12:20:56] <+Thelukok> 4 power 1 cost can't be destroyed
[2023-01-04 12:21:27] <inther4> hopefully lined with ironman
[2023-01-04 12:21:38] <@%zubedoo> 50-50 KEKL
[2023-01-04 12:21:40] <@%zubedoo> go for it
[2023-01-04 12:21:40] <+7h3g3ntl3m4n> @Spyro_ZA If you didnt play Shang, Sunspots would have grown
[2023-01-04 12:21:42] <+Thelukok> play klaw he helps mid too
[2023-01-04 12:21:59] <Zentimuz> Chavez for 18 is safe
[2023-01-04 12:21:59] <@%zubedoo> I think his last card will be Heimdall?
[2023-01-04 12:22:03] <+Thelukok> klaw and the second lands on mid ez
[2023-01-04 12:22:31] <Zentimuz> true true good point

[2023-01-04 12:22:47] <inther4> ironman more value but cable more consistent
[2023-01-04 12:22:48] <+Thelukok> Streaming
[2023-01-04 12:22:49] <Zentimuz> still less value then 9?
[2023-01-04 12:22:59] <+7h3g3ntl3m4n> Sunspot will also grow by 4 since you have mana left
[2023-01-04 12:23:12] <+EdgeBB> if we didnt play the shang chi we would get 8 buff on our sunpots rahter then dead shangchi
[2023-01-04 12:23:15] <+Thelukok> sunspots grow too yeah
[2023-01-04 12:23:23] <+xspectrum7> btw moving nightcrawler into angela lane causing -2 from angela so its bad that makes angela 4 for 2 instead of 6 for 2 @spyro_za
[2023-01-04 12:23:39] <NotRasheed> you're only running units, why arent you playing renfri?
[2023-01-04 12:23:46] <Zentimuz> less likely for him to beat left with Chavez still

[2023-01-04 14:17:48] <Jazzarus_> matchmaking is based on collection level, that is all
[2023-01-04 14:17:49] <%+rotello1> because after a certain point CL matters less than MMR
[2023-01-04 14:17:54] <Diviora> is armor defender ?
[2023-01-04 14:17:54] <Zentimuz> it was trash advice given in some clickbait video it’ll just handicap you
[2023-01-04 14:18:01] <JEPZTEIN> You keep playing in Pool 2 until you reach 600 i think, so people camp there

[2023-01-04 14:25:22] VIEWERS: 296
[2023-01-04 14:25:23] <%crander47> Either missions or bundles for tokens
[2023-01-04 14:25:23] <kungfukarsten> bundle was the best way
[2023-01-04 14:25:24] <%+Benelioto> the bundles are better because they give you collector tokens
[2023-01-04 14:25:27] <Zentimuz> but in your pool just spend forcnow
[2023-01-04 14:25:30] <+miltoff> but as content creator - you may think about buying some bundles, gold etc
[2023-01-04 14:25:31] <inther4> I just save up gold for big bundle
[2023-01-04 14:25:32] <+miltoff> up to you
[2023-01-04 14:25:35] <+ShdwRptr> Buying missions is the most straightforward but the big bundles are the best value overall. They are just sporadic
[2023-01-04 14:25:39] <@%the_olliveira> or if you want to save for really big bundles that they sometime drop
[2023-01-04 14:25:43] <%+rotello1> your best bet is to not spend it
[2023-01-04 14:25:50] <@%+bantonio_banderas> early on you want to refresh missions imo
[2023-01-04 14:25:52] <%+rotello1> waiting for big bundles
[2023-01-04 14:25:54] <AfatSUMO> for me i horde gold for bundles short term its slow but if there is a good bundle like the sunspot bundle i got was giga worth its better long term
[2023-01-04 14:26:11] <Zentimuz> it is limited daily so if you’re thinking of “business expense” start now so you refresh the next days @spyro_za

[2023-01-04 14:41:38] <+7h3g3ntl3m4n> You should cut a 5. three of them is too many for this list
[2023-01-04 14:41:40] <+xspectrum7> add nova for 1 cost he has a synergy with killmonger @spyro_za
[2023-01-04 14:41:46] <Zentimuz> Deck has too much provision CoolCat
[2023-01-04 14:41:46] <kr3du> sunspot is one of the best 1's in the game, but playing it with killmonger isn't great, cuz even if u armor it u armor ur opponent 1's aswell
[2023-01-04 14:41:55] <inther4> I think it fine we only play monger if opponent play zoo
[2023-01-04 14:42:09] <inther4> or switch sunspot with nova

[2023-01-04 14:42:22] <Zentimuz> Maybe Nova instead of Sunspot so it benefits you too incase?

[2023-01-04 15:43:49] <Baine1> i might try negative zabu, met a few rogue players and leader enjoyers @ShadowplayRed
[2023-01-04 15:44:14] <notlvcatto> Leader DIESOFGRINCH
[2023-01-04 15:44:16] <@%+ShadowplayRed> Also @Spyro_ZA was it the Savage Land Seasonal that brought you finally to Snap? Does it remind you of the jungles of ZA?
[2023-01-04 15:44:18] <dice__17> cannot wait to see when spyro play against  leader
[2023-01-04 15:44:35] <insaniity> mr negative with zabu is kinda redundant @Baine1
[2023-01-04 15:44:37] <Iwilljoy> angela first
[2023-01-04 15:45:14] <Baine1> see it more of 2 alternatives @insaniity
[2023-01-04 15:45:25] <inther4> oh can't play there in turn 5 anyway
[2023-01-04 15:45:26] <dracophoenix_> @insaniity I think the idea is to play zabu on 3, then negative and crystal on 4 to get 3 inverted cards right away
[2023-01-04 15:45:28] <@%+ShadowplayRed> @Baine1 ye my finisher with Zola cucks Leader players, Rogue can be a problem unless you can get off Wong/Zabu & Mystique in same turn but still if Wong or Zabu gets nuked, you got backup plans
[2023-01-04 15:45:39] <@%+xahverius> @ShadowplayRed my CL is only 50 how could that be? you said you were 8k wtf
