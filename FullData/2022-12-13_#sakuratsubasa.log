[2022-12-13 00:00:51] <@%+TheFogz> Because they don't send us the vinegar they normally give us the option of using balsamic or white wine, etc
[2022-12-13 00:01:27] <%+HtomSirveaux85> or butter
[2022-12-13 00:01:34] <@%+TheFogz> I use so much olive oil!
[2022-12-13 00:01:35] <%Coy_Stream> You should suggest to HelloFresh to let users omit specific ingredients. Like if you're allergic to citrus or really hate asparagus.

[2022-12-13 00:26:50] <%+Hyperstryke> Can confirm.
[2022-12-13 00:26:51] <%Neustria> Tue is the conjugated form of tuer (to kill) but yes.
[2022-12-13 00:27:01] <%+sleepyaussor> "to kill" is "tuer" in French, so "tue" is he or she kills

[2022-12-13 00:31:33] <%+HtomSirveaux85> my experience, most of these reheat pretty good
[2022-12-13 00:32:11] <+smbarbour> It's not the same, but Tovala's subscription for their oven is generally single-serving meals.

[2022-12-13 03:11:48] <Ezzlin> That

[2022-12-13 03:11:54] <codemann813> yeah, so if you could just cherry pick the channels you want to get the noise for, that would be great and ideal

[2022-12-13 03:35:53] <@%KiseSwiftmist> Can you make it a percentage? Like 25%?
[2022-12-13 03:35:58] <%$karafruit> I mean I'm kinda inclined to say "go learn archery game" but if Zora locks your dark world that could be a problem
[2022-12-13 03:36:19] <%$karafruit> I think respawning houlihan is maybe not a terrible idea? but that would be something on the rom side, not the poll side
[2022-12-13 03:36:51] <@%KiseSwiftmist> Also I forget. Can retro mode change the archery room to a retro room?

[2022-12-13 03:39:01] <$DarkShadowRage> the room was also put in there because some guy named chris houllahand won a contest or something and got put into the game
[2022-12-13 03:39:30] <%$karafruit> I guess draining 50% could be a good compromise
[2022-12-13 03:39:42] <$DarkShadowRage> ah
[2022-12-13 03:39:53] <$DarkShadowRage> i thought it was there cause of the contest thing

[2022-12-13 03:41:10] <codemann813> one of those guarantee is archery game tho
[2022-12-13 03:41:51] <%$karafruit> if you were guaranteed to always have access to archery game I wouldn't feel bad about saying "go learn archery game" because it's not hard. But if Zora locks dark world it could be a problem
[2022-12-13 03:42:19] <codemann813> tree pulls tiers are part of it
