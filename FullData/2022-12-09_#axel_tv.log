[2022-12-09 14:40:16] <+KiroCEO> @KimSchlongUn69420 my opinion is gear, only because a terrible player with a slick/altyn will skill kill a skilled player with PST GZH/ PS or any poor ammo
[2022-12-09 14:40:49] <Rogier2005> @KimSchlongUn69420 depends on how bad
[2022-12-09 14:40:54] <+KiroCEO> if a skilled player has 5 good bullets thats all they need tho
[2022-12-09 14:41:01] <PlagueDoctor1> @KimSchlongUn69420 thats quite an exxageration tho
[2022-12-09 14:41:27] <+KiroCEO> give me a mosin with snb or a hunter m62 and ill kill a sub par player full geared

[2022-12-09 15:29:25] <coronattvx> can we assume gluhar had direct contact with nakita? or no

[2022-12-09 15:30:32] <+soundskape> nikita is the final boss
[2022-12-09 15:30:33] <+mavvkek> In the credits he is credited as host aswell

[2022-12-09 15:32:45] <%harvey_birdmann> I bet that's why he made arena because his team said he couldn't be a boss in the regular game.
[2022-12-09 15:32:46] <%GeneralZeDe> hey man
[2022-12-09 15:32:49] <%GeneralZeDe> no more event ?

[2022-12-09 15:40:48] <TonisGaming> Did an event start with final episode or was it just to end the story/current events?
[2022-12-09 15:40:54] <+mavvkek> I think all the bosses without unique voicelines except for goons are getting new voicelines
[2022-12-09 15:40:55] <!%+NoiceGuy> This was the event I was waiting for
[2022-12-09 15:40:59] <G0dshine> USEC or BEAR next patch? @Axel_tv

[2022-12-09 15:42:35] <TonisGaming> I think something might happen on the 16th as Nikita asked how many wipes you lived and then said there has been 16 wipes
[2022-12-09 15:42:35] <%sokolotov> we also saw streets video a year ago and it is still not in the game

[2022-12-09 15:43:52] <%Cyanon_gK> hmm, it shows that zryachi and LK work together, that you cant slip pass zryachi to get to LK and that LK "is here"

[2022-12-09 15:46:24] <!%+NoiceGuy> Nikita said you could kill him
[2022-12-09 15:46:27] <TonisGaming> I'd find it pretty cool if Chepushilla became a goon name for Glukar guard
[2022-12-09 15:46:28] <!%+NoiceGuy> a long time ago
[2022-12-09 15:46:35] <!%+NoiceGuy> Might have changed
[2022-12-09 15:46:37] <%+lordhoobla> i hope they somehow prevent people from camping at lightkeeper
[2022-12-09 15:46:39] <coronattvx> invencable or antler man killes everybody near light keeper
[2022-12-09 15:46:39] <%DoneFeedingTheFox> I imagine you can die, but it will cause whoever doing the crime to get attacked by guard
[2022-12-09 15:46:51] <+Chrischros1> @TonisGaming i tought about he going to dome and sniping there
[2022-12-09 15:46:59] <%GeneralZeDe> @NoiceGuy hey man do you have a clue if is a new event in night time going on ? cuz of last vid ?
[2022-12-09 15:47:02] <%Aiden_F0xx> then watch as your karma with jhim just plummets to hell and back

[2022-12-09 15:47:10] <+scheper92> could/-should
[2022-12-09 15:47:12] <coronattvx> antler man has to be the guy who protects eveybody
[2022-12-09 15:47:15] <!%+NoiceGuy> I think they might take your guns
[2022-12-09 15:47:26] <!%+NoiceGuy> there's been several instances of them taking guns in the videos
[2022-12-09 15:47:28] <geryones> @NoiceGuy  do you think the riot shield  is  comming?
[2022-12-09 15:47:30] <%+legodude1010> Is there a new event today with the release of Chronicles of Ryzhy?
[2022-12-09 15:47:39] <!%+NoiceGuy> @geryones I know it is but it's a boss weapon
[2022-12-09 15:47:42] <+mavvkek> Boat V-Exit costs 200k take it or leave it
[2022-12-09 15:47:47] <duckwastaken_> maybe they will place guards, that only attack when you shoot someone
[2022-12-09 15:47:51] <!%+NoiceGuy> @GeneralZeDe event is over
[2022-12-09 15:47:57] <TonisGaming> I feel like the boat would be some sort of paid or trust based extract pertaining to Lightkeeper
[2022-12-09 15:48:00] <!%+NoiceGuy> exactly

[2022-12-09 15:48:02] <+faulty_1> I think the lighthouse is going to have bunker extract
[2022-12-09 15:48:02] <!%+NoiceGuy> idk
[2022-12-09 15:48:06] <coronattvx> but then again.  we need special acess to even cross the bridge without getting shot right?

[2022-12-09 17:25:55] <30boideep> @joexnotxexotic what was the dog tags event
[2022-12-09 17:25:56] <@%ImSoBurr_> Not sure if you saw this @Axel_tv Most recent one, had an empty raid a couple weeks back, 110% empty. Raiders are outside of server, I decide I don't feel like fighting them, head to extract. Halfway down green stairs I hear 2 nades go off, went back up to investigate, and all 3 of the raiders are dead  LUL  . No PMCs in sight.
[2022-12-09 17:25:56] <%iSnipeLikeJesus> @JOExNOTxEXOTIC What kind of event?

[2022-12-09 17:34:47] <robinhun7> low recoil, low recoil, but sadly low ergo as well
[2022-12-09 17:35:02] <Moeyyy94> I'm worried arena will be expensice im a standard account pleb thats broke lol
[2022-12-09 17:35:06] <Moeyyy94> price predictions?
[2022-12-09 17:35:24] <%+SteelRhythm> $24.99 is my guess.
[2022-12-09 17:35:24] <Moeyyy94> hopefully
[2022-12-09 17:35:36] <xdtrm> is there new event?
[2022-12-09 17:35:37] <%Qweets> 39.99 is what I'm guessing

[2022-12-09 17:35:43] <!%bonjour_jourbon> 24.99 probably BUT without taxe x)
[2022-12-09 17:35:47] <Moeyyy94> i would pay 40 but 20 is doable

[2022-12-09 17:35:47] <@%ImSoBurr_> I really hope they don't screw it up and allow you to bring gear from the main game
