[2022-12-08 18:41:03] <+ShapNine> you could get some extra proficency since you maxed it out awhile ago
[2022-12-08 18:41:10] <!%KaptainWutax> maybe 10% is too much, but idk
[2022-12-08 18:41:46] <%+Nfora> tbh the right way was probably to make it a curve instead of just slower all over.
[2022-12-08 18:41:47] <+olewk> remove shild and add it to sword?
[2022-12-08 18:41:48] <theredapple1> you probably lost like 120 gold off that
[2022-12-08 18:41:59] <@%$jdsaur> yeah, it's like instead of 10% chestplate, 10% shield, it would've been 20% chestplate right ?

[2022-12-08 18:43:36] <%juliancuten> i guess the better fix was restart it to 0% and then abe had the option to put 20% progress in any gear he wants to pursue?
[2022-12-08 18:43:39] <theredapple1> well you did get a god shield
[2022-12-08 18:43:43] <%TacticIcarus> I mean we can just straight out ban Wutax so there's no way he will nerf us right? Clueless
[2022-12-08 18:43:43] <@%$jdsaur> SUBLY baboHi also I'm not a bot NOPERS
[2022-12-08 18:43:47] <phantomvander> Here is the Reason, the original price for crafting was 10 times more expensive, they forgot to adjust the % increase from crafting
[2022-12-08 18:43:58] <BryzaSG1> You would have had to spend that gold to get to 10% already anyways so nothing is lost and you got crafts at 100% skill way earlier than intended for you to be at
[2022-12-08 18:44:00] <vietxj1> Abe are you not going to play the new TFT season?
[2022-12-08 18:44:16] <bl00d_jam> But it's not a server change, it's a mod pack change. Really don't think it is targeted lol
[2022-12-08 18:44:24] <@%$jdsaur> it's lost cause it would've been on chestplate instead of shield
[2022-12-08 18:44:46] VIEWERS: 309
[2022-12-08 18:44:49] <ping_ling_> Maybe ask iskall if the shield percent can be put to chest. u should get to choose that
[2022-12-08 18:44:56] <phantomvander> Ok then you can argue to move that 10% in shield to chest plate that sounds reasonable

[2022-12-08 20:09:31] <CamChancey> Ok good!
[2022-12-08 20:09:34] <+fizz_fizz1575> like he just lost his weapons and armour right?
[2022-12-08 20:09:35] <+DrowningAquaman> I thought it was a thing because theres a gamerule command to require being in party to join the vault and that was the point of that game rule
[2022-12-08 20:09:35] <CamChancey> Just a bummer
[2022-12-08 20:09:44] <justshawm> Abe should probably help Ryan gear up tho. since he couldn't save him like he said he would.

[2022-12-08 20:13:34] <lpandamoniuml> I think some of the confusion with that time iskall tried to save hrry is that hrry died right  after iskall had entered thats what gave him the opportunity  to try and save him. I think the timing of that situation could have giving that impression but it was just coincidence.

[2022-12-08 20:19:57] <Bfreed10> Why would the vault stay open until time runs out if its only one person in and they die? I feel like it makes sense that it would close.
[2022-12-08 20:20:40] <@%zvr1> so how long are people able to enter the vault in the beginning?

[2022-12-08 20:22:54] <bonsai_troll> Abe, Iskall had a vault where he went in to Harrys vault when he died in the paint bucket room. He was trying to be a hero buttttttt he went in the vault and within moments of him going in harry died. This one event set a confusion of someone going in to save a person and them already being dead.

[2022-12-08 20:28:38] <IAmMunzee> I agree with the nerf but I think 10x is too harsh. Maybe 50% reduction
[2022-12-08 20:28:43] <%matikss321> man of mystery :D
[2022-12-08 20:28:52] <+mathochist> @KaptainWutax wait did iskall lie to me PoroSad

[2022-12-08 20:29:25] <%+Nfora> Good thing there are 100 levels
[2022-12-08 20:29:30] <%+its_not_earl> if 100% at level 60, it should scale to your level
[2022-12-08 20:29:31] <@%zvr1> @jdsaur OMEGALOOL
[2022-12-08 20:29:33] <%+sarcastic_minion> wats the nerf guys?
[2022-12-08 20:29:38] <IAmMunzee> 5x and a change from 0.1-2% to 0.1-1% per craft would be ok
[2022-12-08 20:29:41] <%TacticIcarus> @amiClaire_ semester end Dec 23, spring begin Jan 23 yeeShrug
[2022-12-08 20:29:42] <crayadass> i don't think you are suppost to get 100% at lvl 60 no?
[2022-12-08 20:29:44] <nick98taylor> tbf u did get lots of vault coins, and that should be the limiting factor
[2022-12-08 20:29:47] <DJay249> will be another 900 crafts i'd imagine
[2022-12-08 20:29:51] <InsaneDevil10> they should have reduced your proficiency to 50 percent or so..
[2022-12-08 20:29:53] <%Demonara> @jdsaur OMEGALOOL nice one
[2022-12-08 20:29:55] <%amiClaire_> TacticIcarus woah
[2022-12-08 20:30:04] <%Rickma_Jr> you, ryan, sparkle, who are the other 2?
[2022-12-08 20:30:04] <RaaOne11> it might scale to allow you to get there
[2022-12-08 20:30:09] <JessicaSong> 100 is the max lvl?
[2022-12-08 20:30:13] <%+Honeth> that was always intented btw
[2022-12-08 20:30:16] <%juliancuten> if the estimate was 150 gold per 10%
[2022-12-08 20:30:18] <theredapple1> average on .1 per item
[2022-12-08 20:30:20] <+allys1004> @amiClaire_ wow really? mine ends Dec 18, back Jan 2
[2022-12-08 20:30:22] <chibipro22> Abe, I think you are one of the most interesting streamers out there (send this to my chat 30 minutes from now, and don't forget to remove this part of the message)
[2022-12-08 20:30:22] <%+Honeth> but you'd need 500 crafts with max roll
[2022-12-08 20:30:22] <%juliancuten> you need 1500 crafts xD
[2022-12-08 20:30:40] <%amiClaire_> that's what i knew when i was in school allys1004
[2022-12-08 20:30:45] <%TacticIcarus> Different school set their own academic calendar
[2022-12-08 20:30:52] <%+Nfora> Just remember that looting efficiency is going to increase. 5x Wealthy etc.
[2022-12-08 20:30:59] <@%$jdsaur> @chibipro22 how much ? OkaygeBusiness
[2022-12-08 20:30:59] <IAmMunzee> No 50 crafts wouldn‚Äôt it
[2022-12-08 20:31:00] <DJay249> yeah so on average, assuming its linear distribution, will be about 900 crafts
[2022-12-08 20:31:05] <%+ItsQuipz> 4500 vault alloy yikers
[2022-12-08 20:31:12] <+waikitakore> u completed 20% with the time u spent. Does that mean u need 4x the time u already spent to max one?
[2022-12-08 20:31:13] <theredapple1> right
[2022-12-08 20:31:17] VIEWERS: 586
[2022-12-08 20:31:23] <drebisdavid> yeah and only on one gear
[2022-12-08 20:31:30] <!%KaptainWutax> DMed you the level scaling if you wanna have a look LUL
[2022-12-08 20:31:30] <Bfreed10> Thats nuts lmao
[2022-12-08 20:31:35] <%+Honeth> wait would that be the medium?
[2022-12-08 20:31:36] <theredapple1> but you can upgrade gold later at level 50
[2022-12-08 20:31:45] <%juliancuten> no shot abe is lucky xD
[2022-12-08 20:31:45] <%+Honeth> between 0.01 and .2
[2022-12-08 20:31:46] <FlufflyCthulu> especially on single player that's kinda crazy
[2022-12-08 20:31:48] <nick98taylor> only take 50 craft if max roll 2% tho?

[2022-12-08 20:32:17] <nick98taylor> i see they nerf from 2 to 0.2
[2022-12-08 20:32:17] <%+Honeth> wutax the scaling is in the configs right?

[2022-12-08 20:33:00] <!%KaptainWutax> takes roughly as much time from 0-40 to 40-60
[2022-12-08 20:33:09] <IAmMunzee> 1000 crafts if you get 0.1% every time. 50 crafts if max roll
[2022-12-08 20:33:11] <!%KaptainWutax> and then it takes the same amount of time from 0-90 and 90-100

[2022-12-08 20:34:58] <DoobDestroyer420> more catalyst runs maybe
[2022-12-08 20:35:10] <nick98taylor> gold is the limiting factor tho
[2022-12-08 20:35:13] <therezel> @KaptainWutax  oh thats feel good
[2022-12-08 20:35:16] <crayadass> have you been using cataysts to run wealthy vaults? iskall did one today and got over 2k bronze
[2022-12-08 20:35:17] VIEWERS: 579
[2022-12-08 20:35:27] <RaaOne11> no 1000 is the max, you will most likely have to craft 700-800 pieces
[2022-12-08 20:35:35] <drenix> @IAmMunzee the max roll is 0.2 now not 2% so its actually 500 crafts
[2022-12-08 20:35:37] <!%KaptainWutax> can't really comment on that, but I know it was always supposed to be a late game thing
[2022-12-08 20:35:37] <crayadass> and that is still in early game
[2022-12-08 20:35:39] <vhblast> @Abe  the problem is till you get to apprentice  you can't roll epic so max you can get for now is rare

[2022-12-08 20:35:53] <drenix> @RaaOne11 0.01 is low roll so technically 10,000 crafts total right?
