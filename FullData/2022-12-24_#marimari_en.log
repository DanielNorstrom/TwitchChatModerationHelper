[2022-12-24 08:32:44] <$GimmeAFreekinUsername> I love the taste of Pepto. Getting sick to my stomach always has a silver lining because of it.

If there was a restaurant that sold Pepto flavored milkshakes, I would probably never leave it. I feel ashamed for loving gross medicine this much but it's who I am and I cannot change this.

It includes self-image issues, difficulty managing emotions and behavior, and a pattern of unstable relationships.
