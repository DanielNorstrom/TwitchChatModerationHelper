[2023-01-09 00:01:08] <IxNVxU> @flats random question. What ideas do you have to make ranked more competitive.
[2023-01-09 00:01:09] <+Necrosythe> @BIGLegit NODDERS
[2023-01-09 00:01:11] <IxNVxU> ?

[2023-01-09 00:01:30] <ehwanawanga> I been gettin pretty decent W/ zen hes fun
[2023-01-09 00:01:35] <%sofishdekat> @modestghost dropped a link in disco eth
[2023-01-09 00:01:36] <jackstoningt0n> Yeah except my Gold support teammates said ‚ÄúKiriko and Lucio are the worst support duo because of the low healing output‚Äù üôÉüôÉ
[2023-01-09 00:01:36] <+CheezeVViz> @modestghost modest mouse slaps, if all you know is float on you gotta check out there older stuff ie: lonesome crowded west
[2023-01-09 00:01:38] <%+ceilingenjoyer> ranks below masters have no meta
[2023-01-09 00:01:42] <+Edd_DoDo> was really fun
[2023-01-09 00:01:43] <%+ceilingenjoyer> you can play literally anything in metal ranks
[2023-01-09 00:01:52] <DeerMan112> f the meta play how u wanna play, or do im just a random dude on the internet XD
[2023-01-09 00:01:52] <+CartographerSol> Low mmr tends to disragard everything that doesn't make your numbers on the scoreboard go up
[2023-01-09 00:01:54] <Smokeymcbob007> any good healer comps?
[2023-01-09 00:01:54] <+SSafety> @ceilingenjoyer facts
[2023-01-09 00:02:09] <friendlymushroom6969> well no, my point is that the meta is changing between every rank iteration, there is no determining meta yet everyone says that there is one meta but any hero can be played per rank every season
[2023-01-09 00:02:12] <%corrupted_mutant_> lol

[2023-01-09 00:02:19] <+x_animus_x> Why does JQ have 425 hp with no armor. Why not 450? 425 seems so random
[2023-01-09 00:02:22] <GrayNyquil> Lmao
[2023-01-09 00:02:26] <tonoo___> i love when other players can determine when i get to play xD

[2023-01-09 00:02:50] <+Necrosythe> @friendlymushroom6969 You don't get it. When T500 players talk about the meta. They are talking about at the highest levels of play. Your experience and changing metas in low elo aren't what theyre talking about
[2023-01-09 00:02:51] <AstroElio> R they adding ctf tomorrow in ranked?
[2023-01-09 00:02:57] <rtx3080ti_abuser> @friendlymushroom6969 are you trolling for sure KEKW

[2023-01-09 00:03:00] <friendlymushroom6969> Well there is no better plays when there are better players that ca do those plays

[2023-01-09 00:03:34] <%+aaymon86> They need to double vortex's height lol
[2023-01-09 00:03:34] <„Ç¢„É≥„ÇØ„É´„Éà„É≥„Çµ„É≥ (uncletonn)> why would you rank a game for low ranks we have potato aim and no game sense literally every hero works and not works at the same time
[2023-01-09 00:03:36] <IxNVxU> @hahaamerchant I find Orisa and Hog to be way less engaging.
[2023-01-09 00:03:39] <MeAmGroot> balance for top ranks as lower doesnt follow meta, they play what they want
[2023-01-09 00:03:52] <%$atsBrew> everybody is gonna have a fun time YEP
[2023-01-09 00:03:53] <+kazenblade29> What if each Rank has characters with different abilities.
[2023-01-09 00:03:54] <%IronAddictKidd> @friendlymushroom6969 when people talk about metas in games period its ALWAYS about at the highest level of play.
[2023-01-09 00:04:04] <+Necrosythe> wait am I so old now that people are talking about Modest Mouse like they're a semi hidden gem? *shakes fist at sky
[2023-01-09 00:04:11] <%+invaderdibvr> I still want to know why vortex doesn't reach the skybox to do what it should be doing best.
[2023-01-09 00:04:14] <KomradWolf> Lower ranks is an ffa but some people can‚Äôt kill you. It definitely doesn‚Äôt mean they help either
[2023-01-09 00:04:19] <%Eth213> @modestghost its a bop catJAM
[2023-01-09 00:04:20] <%$ilovepooping12> New hero being released next season called BumHole
[2023-01-09 00:04:25] <%$atsBrew> there was a player that climbed with just one-tricking Brig, can't recall their name but it happened
[2023-01-09 00:04:38] <friendlymushroom6969> I think the casual community and the ranked community should both have a gamemode for determining metas and whether the meta is for the highest skill players because I don't think this game is self sustaining or consistent
[2023-01-09 00:04:38] <uistepbro> tru
[2023-01-09 00:04:39] <%+ceilingenjoyer> @friendlymushroom6969 There is no meta in low elo. The closest thing to a meta is that anything which aims for you is good because no one can hit anything
[2023-01-09 00:04:50] <+CartographerSol> FIRE AT WILL ResidentSleeper NERF THIS! ResidentSleeper EXPERIENCE TRANQUILITY ResidentSleeper HAMMER DOWN ResidentSleeper RALLY TO ME! ResidentSleeper OH LETS BREAK IT DOWN
[2023-01-09 00:04:56] <+Nynzy> When balancing top down, they still fix issues that are created over it.  Like when they buffed Reaper during GOATS, it destroyed lower ranks, but they reigned him in~
[2023-01-09 00:04:59] <jordan7735> balance for competition in high elo, balance for fun in low elo
[2023-01-09 00:05:00] <brettoreo> OW should allow players to show their rank starting at PLAT in Comp games
[2023-01-09 00:05:02] <$tulleeeeee> During goats, i think lower skill people never played goats :D
[2023-01-09 00:05:07] <%Edatox_Sarenu> and also the trickle down effect, lower level players can learn how to get better at the game as they learn and observe from high level players (at least thats what i can spew out, dont know if its correct)
[2023-01-09 00:05:09] <fenyenn> flats i have a question will i get another chance of getting ramattra if miss this current bp
[2023-01-09 00:05:14] <+Necrosythe> @friendlymushroom6969 every competitive game does it this way and it works fine. You aren't some super genius with a novel idea
[2023-01-09 00:05:16] <friendlymushroom6969> I messaged an overwatch league player about ranks (karq) and he agreed
[2023-01-09 00:05:18] <%hazza_on_tw> the thing is people will probably never be satisfied but it doesnt stop the game from being fun

[2023-01-09 00:06:41] <friendlymushroom6969> He did give out tips on his youtube and did some videos about the meta, i think they should buff heroes where they are good on every rank. Otherwise it is unstable and unclimable. The game is sad how it is
[2023-01-09 00:06:53] <%AAstroGamess> just noticed the !mayhem command needs to be updated

[2023-01-09 00:08:11] <friendlymushroom6969> Right, so talk about power creep and how thats effected the game over time. It's like when heroes go from being good in high and low rank to only being are good in low rank, its forever changing yet blizzard are not changing a thing and no one is talking high notes about it
[2023-01-09 00:08:16] <TheUngentleman> @DeerMan112 that is already a feature of the game XD

[2023-01-09 00:25:55] <%+ke1thar> @KingDowning Basically every 7 wins or 20 losses, it adjusts your ranks based on performance

[2023-01-09 00:26:03] <%+ceilingenjoyer> There is a tiny bit of performance based ranking but the SR change is tiny; to rank up it's as simple as winning more than you lose

[2023-01-09 00:32:05] <%+aaymon86> You can block tire
[2023-01-09 00:32:06] <%+ceilingenjoyer> @KingDowning Your healing number is a terrible measure of how well you're playing as support.

[2023-01-09 00:32:08] <%+ke1thar> if it bugged, it was with a patch
[2023-01-09 00:32:09] <%n0veeti> i havent even been here and i have got a gifted sub. NOICE
[2023-01-09 00:32:10] <+Necrosythe> The point still stays. 1. if you are really doing well you will win more than 50% in the long run. dont focus on individual games. and 2. you still just want to make sure you are learning from those games
[2023-01-09 00:32:10] <%axdragon1105> no you can block tire
[2023-01-09 00:32:12] <woodiey_> "I think it's bugged" is the unofficial tagline of OW2 LUL
[2023-01-09 00:32:18] <%+aaymon86> I've done it
[2023-01-09 00:32:20] <jordan7735> I feel like all one-shot should be telegraphed or ults, otherwise, one step from cover should mean you're "safe". just my ideal version of the game. playing against Ashe and/or Sigma is way more enjoyable than Widow and/or Hog
[2023-01-09 00:32:33] <emeraldplums> Is it true that if you got the worse tank of the 2 in your team, you will most likely lose?
[2023-01-09 00:32:38] <KingDowning> @Necrosythe thats why i am wondering how much stats play into it :) thanks :)
[2023-01-09 00:32:41] <+Necrosythe> stop focusing on your stats and just focus on if you feel like you are actually carrying and winning over 50% of games with a good sample size
[2023-01-09 00:32:44] <theogshadowzer> Flats does zarya have an place in the current meta whatsoever?
[2023-01-09 00:32:49] <%$ilovepooping12> @emeraldplums So they say
[2023-01-09 00:32:50] <+Necrosythe> deff don't worry about the stats
[2023-01-09 00:33:00] <%+BuffGenji45> @jordan7735 yeah i agree, I get that widow is "high skill" but its so unfun to play against someone where if ur head peaks for 1 frame you die
[2023-01-09 00:33:14] <SinisterToady> but tire is always detonated above your head and get you clipped
[2023-01-09 00:33:23] <+Shozinoo> don't listen to him, the more numbers you do the more you get matched with players with big numbers too Kappa

[2023-01-09 00:33:35] <%apollo_1199> i think
[2023-01-09 00:33:37] <emeraldplums> @ilovepooping12 like if it‚Äôs a ‚Äútank diff‚Äù you almost have no chance of winning

[2023-01-09 00:33:47] <%+ceilingenjoyer> @KingDowning Straight up, just ignore stats. Think about your positioning and decision making. Use cover, make sure you die as little as possible, and try to maximize your utility and damage. That's how you improve.
[2023-01-09 00:33:48] <%+aaymon86> @theogshadowzer She's good against Orisa
[2023-01-09 00:34:00] <easy_iced> @ilovepooping12 pls stop lying
[2023-01-09 00:34:13] <legitrambo> How do you keep playing this game continuously? This game feels so stressful to me @flats
[2023-01-09 00:34:14] <KingDowning> @ceilingenjoyer you the goat, thank you for the help i appreciate it <3
[2023-01-09 00:34:14] <%apollo_1199> @theogshadowzer oh really? i havent seen her go against orisa i might be wrong then
[2023-01-09 00:34:16] <emeraldplums> If the other team got the ‚Äúbetter‚Äù tank whatever that means, you‚Äôll have hard time winning
[2023-01-09 00:34:21] <%$ilovepooping12> I have proof

[2023-01-09 00:34:57] <%$ilovepooping12> I will now
[2023-01-09 00:34:58] <emeraldplums> Orisa is just too much
[2023-01-09 00:35:03] <%+ceilingenjoyer> @KingDowning For example, a mercy with insane healing numbers is actually playing way worse than a mercy that has low healing numbers but uses lots of damage boost. As Ana, you want to be using your nades for anti instead of for healing your teammates whenever possible. Good supports do way more than heal.

[2023-01-09 00:35:46] <theogshadowzer> @aaymon86 A bad Orisa maybe a smart Orisa will wait for her bubbles to go then spear her to oblivion
[2023-01-09 00:35:50] <%+ceilingenjoyer> That doesn't mean you should play DPS Moira in the enemy backline, but you shouldn't just think about healing either
[2023-01-09 00:35:53] <%$ace__balthazar> imagine if all the tanks were as hard to kill as orisa
[2023-01-09 00:36:12] <emeraldplums> It‚Äôs true, tank role is very stressful and have huge responsibility
[2023-01-09 00:36:17] <Miassimaissi> @ceilingenjoyer but sometimes your team loves to feed and you're forced to heal bot more
[2023-01-09 00:36:26] <+diamondave_> huge
[2023-01-09 00:36:33] <%+theasianthrust> yeah supports are support characters, they dont just heal! Stats aren't everything

[2023-01-09 00:37:08] <%+ceilingenjoyer> @Miassimaissi Some games you'll need to heal more than others, sure. But you will _always_ be doing things other than healing, no matter the game. Remember, you'd always rather prevent damage (aka kill the enemy faster) than heal
[2023-01-09 00:37:13] <Miassimaissi> I wish tanks and dps players would know how to use covers and cooldowns so that supports can do more offensive plays

[2023-01-09 00:38:31] <%+aaymon86> @theogshadowzer Same can be said with Zarya.  Try to time bubble with spear and melt Orisa with her primary fire.

[2023-01-09 00:41:49] <%+ceilingenjoyer> @Miassimaissi look, sometimes you'll get teammates that hard feed and you can't do anything. But just as often, the same thing will happen to the other team. Nothing you can do about it but improve yourself. If people are flaming you, mute them and move on. They're in the same rank as you - they don't know any better than you do.

[2023-01-09 01:09:50] <%$ilovepooping12> Yeah so basically the Guinea pigs had beef with each other and would email each other videos. That‚Äôs when there owners would travel Texas to this huge Guinea pig fight arena. That‚Äôs where big Dave the Guinea pig got his 23-0
[2023-01-09 01:09:50] <+GoldClassGaming> @aaymon86 nope. There's only 2.5 abilities in the game that can block the punches
