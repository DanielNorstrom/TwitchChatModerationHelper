[2022-12-08 22:09:27] <Transandproud89> The strange thing is Fog Wise shouldn’t work on stealth killers. Killer auras aren’t revealed when they’re undetectable. I think Fog Wise is just bugged

[2022-12-08 23:29:04] <!%^Nightbot> For all of December I will have a Christmas tree up. Users can have ornaments added to the tree with their name written on it by: 1) gifting at least 5 subs (at once please for my sanity) = 1 ornament. // 2) subscribing with a t2 or t3 = 1 ornament // 3)giving 1k bits =1 ornament  // 4) Redeeming a Channel Point reward for an ornament with your name // Thank you for the support!
