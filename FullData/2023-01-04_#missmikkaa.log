[2023-01-04 15:33:50] <%Dualistic> @CasualEmma Hihi how are you?
[2023-01-04 15:33:55] <seantropolis> Proc is used as both a noun and a verb to describe whenever a random gaming item activates or a random gaming event occurs

[2023-01-04 15:34:09] <%RandomRed38> why not Random?
[2023-01-04 15:34:09] <@%Radolov> It's probably because of some RNG feauture, like a crit or somehting
[2023-01-04 15:34:10] <Eddy___Gordo> hello MissMikkaa, your streams are very entertaining , thank you much

[2023-01-04 15:34:26] <+Att442> Because it was used for random crits
[2023-01-04 15:34:26] <Sphhinx> because usually a spell will have like 15% de proc or whatever the number. So it's random technically
[2023-01-04 15:34:31] <%brianthebroken85> So if they program something to happen like 15% of the time...
[2023-01-04 15:34:31] <+teatimetm> if it always happens it's technically not a proc... but noone cares
[2023-01-04 15:34:33] <sehirayou> Pseudo random

[2023-01-04 15:35:09] <@%Yruhatin> it's random for many mechanics but the word is still used for things like this
[2023-01-04 15:35:11] <%stevo_james> sometimes it's procedure - when an item procs, the procedure in the code is run

[2023-01-04 15:36:01] <%$TravisVroman> I think it's something like "Programmed Random OCcurrance"
[2023-01-04 15:36:03] <@%Kano> Proc was originally short for "spec_proc" (spec_proc is short for "special process"[1]) which is a term used by the original programmer of Circle-MUD

[2023-01-04 15:41:48] <@%Kano> depends, if you're crazy then you think you're normal and that would make everyone else crazy - that's how I do it at least
[2023-01-04 15:41:49] <%h_filmbert> I'm not insane, I'm not insaaaaaane

[2023-01-04 15:42:12] <%brianthebroken85> I also wondered if "What do you mean??!" should be an emote... You do say it in a rather distinct way. :D
[2023-01-04 15:42:16] <%$TravisVroman> I would say it's insane/crazy if you kept doing it this long unsuccessfully. But the fact you're doing it and it's _working_... is it crazy if it works?

[2023-01-04 16:48:09] <edemilio_> algebra
[2023-01-04 16:48:11] <AdmiralFrazer> my thought is the scythe, it has natural bleed and then you add frost so it has both, does tons of damage and you can add pretty much any ash of war
[2023-01-04 16:48:19] <Elyseums> when you beat this.. next step would be playing upside down and using the controller with your feet and the dance pad with the hands?

[2023-01-04 17:02:50] <C_Squared20> That was a very solid attempt!
[2023-01-04 17:03:03] <+Akasan_Plays> I'm very curious as to how your brain works. Amazing.
[2023-01-04 17:03:04] <%Longknife> How do you feel about Mohg's Spear for this? Too OP? riffThink The reason I suggest it: Bloodboon ritual basically let's you start her first Waterfowl on command, it can fairly safely be used once, and it removes ~30% HP from phase 2. The weapon itself is "okay" vs. her, but she also has bad spacing vs. it and can get hit by strong attacks consistently.
[2023-01-04 17:03:05] <PhascolarK> you play on guitar hero controller next? :P
[2023-01-04 17:03:08] <FlongBongle> @vishhiss also telekinetically

[2023-01-04 17:03:11] <%gkingx88> you could do dance pad and one hand on the controller next

[2023-01-04 19:19:01] <%Michelanio> advantage of this little "break" is that I can make food at the same time
[2023-01-04 19:19:03] <zodicz> or wait is blasphemous on hit or on killed enemy pvpThink

[2023-01-04 19:19:43] <Archronos> that is the way to think about pinned messages, as long as it informs some people. it wont inform all as many people watch twitch in many ways eg devices that show chat, ones that dont, ones that dont show pins etc
