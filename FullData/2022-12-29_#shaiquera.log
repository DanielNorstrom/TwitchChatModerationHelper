[2022-12-29 11:51:31] <vix3n1984> Yeah
[2022-12-29 11:52:02] VIEWERS: 121
[2022-12-29 11:52:42] <+JB_Warsmith> That only gives you a very small amount of rapport. There's three things you can do every day to get loads more rapport, and gain her trust much faster.
[2022-12-29 11:52:54] <alienembryo> Maybe villains are actually do more good fot the world than heroes do, because heroes create villains, & villains create heroes
[2022-12-29 11:53:16] <vix3n1984> She loves the area where you get dungeon quests she just goes mad there and you get lots of rapport
[2022-12-29 11:53:28] <+JB_Warsmith> She has some personal quests, and will give you a reward when you complete all of them
[2022-12-29 11:53:51] <vix3n1984> I also think she hates fishing and going on boats
[2022-12-29 11:53:56] <Ninja614> you unlock quests and their dialogue changes. it's also part of the achievement to unlock them to be put in your house

[2022-12-29 11:54:52] <vix3n1984> Oh yes sorry is isobel
[2022-12-29 11:55:04] <+JB_Warsmith> Ember hates fishing, yes
[2022-12-29 11:55:28] <vix3n1984> Wait what platform are you on pc?
[2022-12-29 11:55:35] <+JB_Warsmith> But she REALLY likes mages guild daily, thieves guild heist, and high isle daily delve
[2022-12-29 11:55:40] <vix3n1984> I‚Äôm on ps4 that‚Äôs probably why.
[2022-12-29 11:56:02] <+JB_Warsmith> Those each gives you 125 rapport while a runestone only gives you 1 rapport.

[2022-12-29 12:31:24] <StormTheImmortal> pay for convenience, not pay to win
[2022-12-29 12:31:33] <ThinaraXx> @EBrarian u get an endless craft bag for storage, can place 50% more things into your houses (but it brings you nothing for your game experience), have 50% more bank space, 10% or so more experience and gold gain (you barely notice that, cause u dont get much gold with questing anyways and xp is not so important)
[2022-12-29 12:31:56] <%EBrarian> mrm that bag does seem to be a necessity to play I suppose
[2022-12-29 12:32:09] <ThinaraXx> and of course u get access to all dlcs if u have eso+. if u dont pay for eso+ u can buy the dlcs
[2022-12-29 12:32:09] <%EBrarian> @ThinaraXx thank you :)

[2022-12-29 12:32:28] <StormTheImmortal> i played for a year + with no eso+ and just used alts to hold my crap, it can be done
[2022-12-29 12:32:59] <ThinaraXx> @EBrarian i am playing without eso+ since half an year.. and yes it is harder without, but it is possible. i had enough gold to buy all dlcs i want..
[2022-12-29 12:33:38] <%EBrarian> so many games so little time Sadge
[2022-12-29 12:34:00] <ThinaraXx> and LucaCash, a "famous" eso build creator is playing without eso+ since he is playing the game.. and he came into endgame without it.. so it is possible, but u need more time for inventory managment
[2022-12-29 12:34:12] VIEWERS: 126
[2022-12-29 12:34:33] <+JB_Warsmith> even with ESO+ you need to do inventory management! LUL
[2022-12-29 12:34:43] <%EBrarian> how much is ESO+ ?
[2022-12-29 12:35:25] <Grimwardz> in eu its 8 quid
[2022-12-29 12:35:30] <Grimwardz> pounds
[2022-12-29 12:35:43] <Grimwardz> which aint too bad

[2022-12-29 12:36:16] <ThinaraXx> @EBrarian i dont know.. but if u pay for eso+ u get an amount of crowns (the ingame currency for the ingame shop) that is pretty equal for the amount of money u would spend for crowns. and with that crowns u can get dlcs in the shop

[2022-12-29 13:31:00] <Selena_Ainu> scuttles are smallers, those big ones are traps

[2022-12-29 13:43:16] <TheCyberchill> I dislike how eso handled certain material nodes, they all turn into the endgame ones by the time your cp160 rather then be area based.
[2022-12-29 13:43:42] <xvxjadewizardxvx> maybe I should  jump online and show you where they spawn hehe

[2022-12-29 13:43:50] <TheCyberchill> I much prefer how ff14 does it where it's instanced, per player, the nodes you pickup are say ruby ash for me when it;'s oak for you and i can run up and grab it

[2022-12-29 13:46:14] <Selena_Ainu> @TheCyberchill Not quite true. You get to see the Level of the Crafting skill and the Level you are. You see that good doing your Survey on Characters which are CP 160 BUT have no skill points in crafting.
