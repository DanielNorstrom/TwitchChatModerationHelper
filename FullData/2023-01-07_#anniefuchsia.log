[2023-01-07 00:05:19] <meta_morfik> I love eggs
[2023-01-07 00:05:33] <JiJiJenkins> Fire bad
[2023-01-07 00:05:49] <%Bloodmatch> was fine from looks of it
[2023-01-07 00:06:31] <mcvultur> @AnnieFuchsia you shouldnt destroy more then 3 eggs 4 times. Cus once you do that the boss goes p2 and he gets enraged over time. He starts with 28 eggs and you have to do them in 12 waves so its 8 times 2 eggs and 4 times 3 eggs . Like that you extand as much as possible the p1 to get the boss as low as possible
[2023-01-07 00:06:34] <%+ein_sof93> alot of groups save lust for burn phase
[2023-01-07 00:06:38] <+Blazzerx> is this heroic

[2023-01-07 00:06:47] <matt1stc> elloo
[2023-01-07 00:06:58] <%Mirkooo> So doing eggs a bit slower = Boss goes into P2 later?
[2023-01-07 00:06:58] <%Wardrick7> i feel so useless on this boss Sadge

[2023-01-07 00:08:33] <%Taylor131313> is it worth saving lust for phase 2?

[2023-01-07 00:09:31] <%Collnaris> p2 lust makes more sense imo
[2023-01-07 00:09:32] <mcvultur> @AnnieFuchsia  The best way is to put 4 marks on 4 eggs where you wanna break 3  . Tanks dont need all those marks in the room to move around
[2023-01-07 00:09:33] <%Morgonbladet> No not full hero on boss for all raiders
[2023-01-07 00:09:36] <%Collnaris> since we all focus boss

[2023-01-07 00:09:49] <%+cuwane> do you still have the white cat? or is that a bad question?
[2023-01-07 00:09:57] <%Swiggyswoo_> p2 lust can easily be with half the raid having no cd's up which is bad as well
[2023-01-07 00:10:05] <%PanicRush> why is zemy doing so much fucking dmg when sub is supposed to be weaker than outlaw?
[2023-01-07 00:10:18] <%+Lorrdzik> @cuwane she has

[2023-01-07 00:12:07] <mcvultur> @AnnieFuchsia  i think there will be 2 many ppl dead by then  for it to matter. BL pull is still the best especialy in a pug
[2023-01-07 00:12:08] <PowerSlave_42> all raid alive in the end would be best.

[2023-01-07 00:41:57] <%notzemy> general: - Feint is now baseline for all Rogue specs, learned at level 12. - Elusiveness/Cheat Death - This choice node has moved up to row 2, taking the position where Feint used to be. This will make it possible to take acrobatics and cheat death simultaneously.

[2023-01-07 01:42:54] <%Collnaris> ruby
[2023-01-07 01:43:09] <%itsClubby> ruby is more difficult

[2023-01-07 02:51:08] <%drzaius30> if i cleared that i would shatter my windows LUL
[2023-01-07 02:52:22] <%drzaius30> I had no idea character transfer had a 90 day lockout
[2023-01-07 02:52:37] <%JurgenRapp> yes very understandable, but from the hyper cool dude to that, makes you understand the pressure he must have felt
[2023-01-07 02:52:53] <%drzaius30> sucks if he wants to prog omega when it comes out in 3 weeks
[2023-01-07 02:53:22] <%JurgenRapp> Yeah "funny" thing is that Z just did the same thing with her EU char I think
[2023-01-07 02:53:36] <%drzaius30> Yeah but one way
[2023-01-07 02:53:52] <%JurgenRapp> ah
[2023-01-07 02:54:10] <%drzaius30> the going back part is the problem
[2023-01-07 02:54:41] <%JurgenRapp> yeah I thought she had created it in EU transferred to US to level and then transfer back
[2023-01-07 02:55:04] <%drzaius30> was 100% EU
[2023-01-07 02:55:09] <%JurgenRapp> ok

[2023-01-07 03:03:36] <%drzaius30> but that character is pre endwalker so its only level 70

[2023-01-07 10:49:26] <%Taylor131313> then again they gigabuffed the last boss now, adds have more HP and if you touch the purple shit you're as good as dead
[2023-01-07 10:49:37] <%Taylor131313> might be less free than CoS now
[2023-01-07 10:50:30] <%Geoffku> buffing bosses caveBob
[2023-01-07 10:50:50] <%Taylor131313> Ner'zhul Ritual of Bones will now scale with key level making it much more deadly than before..
[2023-01-07 10:51:21] <%Taylor131313> people in high keys were just ignoring the wall and taking a few seconds of dot since it would disappear a few seconds after wall disappears
[2023-01-07 10:51:26] <%Geoffku> pretty easy not to touch that tho
[2023-01-07 10:51:26] <%Taylor131313> but now it does 160k per tick on a 17 xdd
[2023-01-07 10:51:42] <%Geoffku> I always assumed it insta-killed like eranog LUL
[2023-01-07 10:51:58] <%Taylor131313> you could just pop a defensive and live
[2023-01-07 10:52:06] <%Taylor131313> now adds have like 50% more HP too
[2023-01-07 10:52:11] <%Taylor131313> pretty bad change
[2023-01-07 10:52:16] <%Geoffku> oh yeah that's rough
[2023-01-07 10:52:43] <%Taylor131313> plus we had an evoker and hunter who were deathly allergic to pressing lust it seems

[2023-01-07 10:52:59] <%Geoffku> most groups I've been in never really nuked the add that fast already
[2023-01-07 10:54:27] <%notzemy> monkaS now I'm scared about timing my 19 Burial
[2023-01-07 10:54:45] <%Taylor131313> I also think it was bugged but no one realised, in one of the attempts I got hit with the dot when I was well over the wall
[2023-01-07 10:55:04] <%Taylor131313> PepeLaugh zemy you should've done it earlier
[2023-01-07 10:55:52] <%Taylor131313> I feel like buffing last boss is the worst thing they could've done, it was already pretty painful
[2023-01-07 10:56:01] <%notzemy> I can't predict the future Sadeg
[2023-01-07 10:56:15] <%Taylor131313> they also changed the bird boss in academy so it absolutely shits on tanks now xdd
[2023-01-07 10:56:38] <%Taylor131313> Crawth Savage Peck now always hits the target and cannot be dodged or parried.
[2023-01-07 10:56:43] <%Taylor131313> This hard hitting ability on Crawth is absolutely brutal for tanks on Tyrannical weeks. It's a large up front hit that now can't be blocked, dodged or parried of ~860k damage on +20 (before armor), followed by a ~80k damage every second bleed for 10 seconds (which cannot be reduced by armor). This bleed is absolutely nasty and requires a lot of mitigation, cooldown planning and healing.

[2023-01-07 16:15:53] <FluorescentPickle> they should take a note from FF14 on that one tbh

[2023-01-07 16:16:56] <%ScratchXO> I think older dungeons, the run backs are more severe
[2023-01-07 16:16:57] <%PanicRush> not always the most recent but can be like 1 boss behind
[2023-01-07 16:16:59] <%+evrythingunderthesun> in FFXIV its a bit better but the later WoW dungeons have similar shortcuts
[2023-01-07 16:17:05] <%Mirkooo> Yeah it's very inconsistent
[2023-01-07 16:17:09] <%Mirkooo> In new and old dungeons
[2023-01-07 16:17:14] <%Collnaris> ye FF14 you revive at start when you die
[2023-01-07 16:17:20] <+DanteusS> halls of infusion should be like that

[2023-01-07 16:17:24] <%Makkan780> in some dungeons the beginning would be closer t where you want to be

[2023-01-07 16:55:54] <Lausten> The worst part about the new professions is blizzards vague descriptions of the specilizations, there is no way of knowing what percentage things are with their way of describing, so something that may sound good could easily be the worst choice ever and vice versa..  And the UI makes it even worse to get an overview look at it, wasting so much time reading tooltips and clicking back and forth. ResidentSleeper

[2023-01-07 17:38:50] <%Draedra> can't fix the queues cause thats just a lack of healers queueing tho
[2023-01-07 17:38:51] <foggyfr> when things are just random, having exceptions is just gonna make things worse imo
[2023-01-07 17:39:00] <aoespawn> I can’t believe I haven’t been banned yet, I yell at so many kids when I can go completely oom and my team will have one interrupt, or they just stand in double dps and flop and people who have zero defensive instinct
[2023-01-07 17:39:04] <%itsClubby> Can any tech people help me, my keyboard isn’t typing letters anymore instead each letter key is doing something different

Mind Flay damage increased by 15% (this includes Mind Flay: Insanity, but not the proc from Idol of C’Thun). Mind Spike damage increased by 15%. Void Torrent damage increased by 15%. Devouring Plague damage increased by 15%. Developers’ notes: These changes are aimed at improving Shadow’s single target DPS. The change to Focused Will is a targeted change for PvP

[2023-01-07 17:52:20] <%c0rb4> spriest gets overall buffs but nerfs for pvp
[2023-01-07 17:52:34] <%Mirkooo> @AnnieFuchsia Are we trying last HC boss today or first Mythic boss? PepoG
[2023-01-07 17:52:43] <%itsClubby> I LOVE playing shadow in M+ stupidly fun
[2023-01-07 17:52:45] <+martinbilzer> shadow gets basically nerfed 13.75% of instant cast spells that dmg like mind blast and mind spike, and 25% lowered proc chance in pvp
[2023-01-07 17:52:46] <foggyfr> How come you don't like demo? I played a lock a lot in legion. All specs are good fun imo

[2023-01-07 17:52:59] <%Mirkooo> First Mythic boss might be alot easier
[2023-01-07 17:52:59] <%Wardrick7> only realm can do mythic now

[2023-01-07 17:53:07] <%Makkan780> mythic is way easier
[2023-01-07 17:53:07] <%Wardrick7> so others cant join\
[2023-01-07 17:53:09] <%Nurutooo> MYTHIC first boss should be easy
[2023-01-07 17:53:11] <%Geoffku> i need another heroic rasz weapon caveBob
[2023-01-07 17:53:11] <%itsClubby> You can kill first boss 1000% Annie even the second too

[2023-01-07 17:53:20] <%Geoffku> no
[2023-01-07 17:53:23] <%PanicRush> if its easy, we can attempt 2 mythic

[2023-01-07 17:53:25] <%itsClubby> Good loot from it for some
[2023-01-07 17:53:33] <%Aegis_2566> People will still get 415 loot
[2023-01-07 17:53:33] <%nufardetvaranog> pro tip for long solo shuffles queue as dps: queue for shirmish arena at the same time. then you can practise arena while you wait! solo shuffle will continue queue.
[2023-01-07 17:53:36] <%Aegis_2566> From the first Boss
[2023-01-07 17:53:38] <%PanicRush> terros should be doable?
[2023-01-07 17:53:40] <%Wardrick7> mythic right now is realm only so only ravencrest players can join
[2023-01-07 17:53:48] <%Makkan780> 2 mythic is easier than last heroic
[2023-01-07 17:53:50] <%itsClubby> think the ring is good for some right?
[2023-01-07 17:53:52] <%Mirkooo> Can see how the first boss goes and then still decide on what to do next
[2023-01-07 17:53:52] <%epicpockettroll> just killed heroic rasza btw :p
[2023-01-07 17:53:56] <%Bloodmatch> oj said 2 bosses mythic easier than rasz heroic

[2023-01-07 17:54:28] <aoespawn> Affliction if you can exhaust forcing dispels on your ua,  it’s op and if you can kite with curse of exhaust
[2023-01-07 17:54:32] <%PanicRush> true, but if we pass 1st boss easy, we can try Terros
[2023-01-07 17:54:33] <%Mirkooo> @itsClubby I believe Max NODDERS
[2023-01-07 17:54:43] <%itsClubby> And if anyone knows strategy its that dude

[2023-01-07 18:09:38] <wrath0r> Totally different play styles - one is ranged and one is melee. I'd start with figuring out which of those you'd prefer.

[2023-01-07 19:09:48] <%PanicRush> im looking at Eranog mythic in adventure guide now and it seems pretty much the same as hc, just spawns an extra add and more mobs in the wall intermission
[2023-01-07 19:09:51] <+MonsieurMiquail> Is PvP fun in WoW? I’m nervous to try cause if I mess up and cause my team to lose. Also I play Ret Pala and idk if it good in pvp

[2023-01-07 19:35:25] <%Mirkooo> Maybe it's less about the number, but more about people panicing too much when they get the mark and just tunnel vision on the pillar LUL
[2023-01-07 19:35:44] <%Collnaris> like every council pull i just have to stand next to a pillar because people keep walking into me with marks

[2023-01-07 22:20:28] <raiozin_> @MattTheBat27 yes, but now i'm need to do some DG from SL part, and only the BFA ones are showing to me

[2023-01-07 22:21:26] <%$DevinD0G> Sounds l;ike story campaign progression issue

[2023-01-07 22:21:32] <%+MattTheBat27> once you get to level 60 you should be able to pick whatever expansion you want to level with on new characters
