[2022-12-31 07:45:46] <+Sparowl> 1v1, a space marine probably wins. Inquisitors are more “I command whatever resources I need, including ‘requesting’ space marine help”
[2022-12-31 07:45:48] <$FataltheBaptist> are flamers the preferred weapons

[2022-12-31 07:46:52] <+Sparowl> Inquisitors generally don’t command Space Marines. They ask, and the chapters generally say yes. It’s a politeness thing.

[2022-12-31 07:49:41] <+Sparowl> @resurgen - yes, exactly. There’s an implied “I can’t force you, and might not do anything right now, because if I’m asking for space marine help, other things are going down, but later…the inquisition will have a chat with you.” Although that being said, there’s been occasions where chapters like the Space Wolves and Salamanders have acted against inquisitors, and the inquisitors eventually backed down.

[2022-12-31 07:54:15] <+Sparowl> @imperialfists7 - Indeed. But the inquisition can cause them other problems beyond directly wiping them out. Also, I love the Imperial Fists. The story “One more day on Miral Prime, one more day for Rogal Dorn” is great.
[2022-12-31 07:54:56] <%+Mangyanimal> Above is the easiest term. The inquisition has no authority over GK

[2022-12-31 07:56:01] <SciSeven77> Grey Knights are equal to Inquisitors. The chapter master  of the grey knights(different title) I think is a High Lord of Terra pre-return
[2022-12-31 07:56:17] <rockinrobyn4077> burke did you ruin it for cream he thought he had some great build LOL
[2022-12-31 07:56:23] <+Sparowl> If anyone wants a good series of books on Inquisitors, btw - The Eisenhorn Trilogy is a really good book series by itself, and even better if you like 40k.

[2022-12-31 07:56:35] <+angrapanda> grey knights are basically inquisitor marines
[2022-12-31 07:57:01] <+FoxeyeValkyrie> a lot of that stuff is obtained by doing season characters
[2022-12-31 07:57:13] <+angrapanda> or under grand inquisitor, i think, haven't read much about them
[2022-12-31 07:57:21] <+FoxeyeValkyrie> I think you have like 20 hours of game left at least for the main story
[2022-12-31 07:57:26] <$FataltheBaptist> @Sparowl i have Malleus idk if i have the rest
[2022-12-31 07:57:26] VIEWERS: 1 500
[2022-12-31 07:57:30] <RyanMacGamer> So the Grey Knights worked directly for Malkador and now are under the Ordo Malleus which is a branch of  Inquisition.  Ergo the guy in the cutscene was probably not a full on augmented Space Marine.
[2022-12-31 07:57:35] <RyanMacGamer> my take anyway
[2022-12-31 07:57:57] <$Imperialfists7> @sparowl I love eisenhorn, but it's showing it's age what with abnetts other books and adb's contributions.

[2022-12-31 08:13:08] <%+BaconKings> @BurkeBlack there is no "decks". you create lists for the faction you want to use. certain cards are tied to certain factions so can only be used for them.

[2022-12-31 08:14:15] <+painter42> Is there a deck limit ?
[2022-12-31 08:14:18] <Grogbottle> a ship will have x amount of points to spend on upgrades. As long as that ship takes that type of upgrade, you can equip it, unless the card specifies otherwise (rebel only etc)

[2022-12-31 08:59:03] <$chazisop> i think a 40k mmo would work even worse than the fantasy one. the world doesn't really support player agency in a huge scale

[2022-12-31 09:00:16] <VrtniPatuljak> @Guardian452 mostly its the lack of music(wth devs) and sketchy Ai. but looks amazing
[2022-12-31 09:00:22] <+Guardian452> ah
[2022-12-31 09:00:43] <Vercingetorix4> MADGERS Heckatics
[2022-12-31 09:01:09] <$chazisop> i mean the world of warcraft or w/e usually lets for many little adventurers to exist. most of 40k is "do what you are told and don't question it". few exceptions are things like inquisitors or maybe rogue traders but it would be hard to justify huge amounts of them

[2022-12-31 09:29:24] <%+electrigasms> Star "trak" LUL
[2022-12-31 09:29:27] <Zethuz> yeah but 40k does not reflect the modern society KEKLEO
[2022-12-31 09:29:39] <%Varanid> neeerrrdds! Nerdge
[2022-12-31 09:29:43] <+reddjarum> there is hundreds of 40k novels , this setting has a lot of lore
[2022-12-31 09:29:44] <%Fairlight_Excalibur> Burke you know full well the biggest haters of the 40k show will be 40k fans LUL the show just needs to appeal to casuals instead
[2022-12-31 09:29:45] <CBCronin> If it gets really popular they will ruin the lore with a hundred new shows :)

[2022-12-31 09:30:08] <%Oppai_Nani> Still baffled we havent got a triple A game or movies, series for 40k especially if the lore is that big.. are devs, studios and filmmakers sleeping on it? or just a money thing
[2022-12-31 09:30:14] <%$Strange_Inquiries> Canonically speaking, the emperor walks among us at this very moment while we prepare to head into the golden age of Terra.

[2022-12-31 09:30:36] <%Oppai_Nani> So weird
[2022-12-31 09:30:41] <sshen13> do people watch the Halo series? other than Halo fans?
[2022-12-31 09:30:51] <%NemisizZ> lol
[2022-12-31 09:30:54] <+chobtt> KEKLEO
[2022-12-31 09:30:55] <%Varanid> the deeper you get into 40k lore, the more the 'unreliable narrator' starts to take hold and you learn there's much uncertainty, lies and propaganda
[2022-12-31 09:30:56] <hi_youtube> It's amazing how little chat knows about the things chat says they like lol
[2022-12-31 09:31:04] <Zethuz> the rise and fall of Horus would make the perfect first movie
[2022-12-31 09:31:04] <CK_Zweistein> @Oppai_Nani .. its the licenceowner ... the company is just off
[2022-12-31 09:31:06] <Isgoroth> they need to keep alot of stuff in the dark or just hinted at
[2022-12-31 09:31:08] <+Darthcmo> being vague would work for it anyhow
[2022-12-31 09:31:09] <CBCronin> Like Star Trek Discovery.....
[2022-12-31 09:31:09] <%Oppai_Nani> @sshen13 At this point I think more non halo fans are watching it than halo fans lmaoo
[2022-12-31 09:31:19] <+pwnstar87> They don't need to go into detail, but they can't go full off the rails like Halo or Witcher.
[2022-12-31 09:31:23] <$Imperialfists7> simple villian like tyranids, throw some space marines in, viola
[2022-12-31 09:31:27] <sshen13> @Oppai_Nani really? i have no idea

[2022-12-31 09:31:55] <+Guardian452> well make it for the size of a regular human, Space Marines are genetically manipulated to be like 8 ft tall yes?
[2022-12-31 09:31:56] <%$Strange_Inquiries> @BurkeBlack Do you think they can capture the scope of 40k? It's so large that I don't think they will be able to capture it. I think they could do things on the imperial guards or something resembling us humans.
[2022-12-31 09:31:56] <+Kilgorrr> there are pretty good space marine cosplays around
[2022-12-31 09:31:58] <NeaNelu> starcraft made a cool video explanation on the armor of the terran, showing how they put the armor on tychus
[2022-12-31 09:31:59] <%Oppai_Nani> @CK_Zweistein Oh yea too bad the 40k lore sounds awesome it has everything cool characters, enemies, worlds etc such potential for triple A games or MMO or series, movies
[2022-12-31 09:31:59] <rockinrobyn4077> watch cosplayer how they walk in that armor they can hardly move
[2022-12-31 09:32:12] <sshen13> they can cgi motion but do practical effects close up, like jurassic park
[2022-12-31 09:32:12] <%PaizenCakes> Dreamworks level shit for 40k would the sht
[2022-12-31 09:32:19] <Vercingetorix4> OOOO CGI Warhammer
[2022-12-31 09:32:20] <%Varanid> if fans expect to see marines in  combat for 90% of the show are going to be surprised. It MUST be a drama based in 40k, not tabletop reproduction
[2022-12-31 09:32:20] <Isgoroth> @BurkeBlack i dont think its going to show space marines, its going to be "normal" humans
[2022-12-31 09:32:22] <Joren456> dont use avatar as example, they poured money into it and didnt even make half of it back
[2022-12-31 09:32:25] <%$WabbitRequiem> @rockinrobyn4077 and thats foam , not metal
[2022-12-31 09:32:35] <%GuardianAngelz> @BurkeBlack how much is a bil. dollars for a company like amazon these days anyway, didn't they put 1b into Rings of Power too?
[2022-12-31 09:32:36] <Scoobky> @burkeblack in you opinion with the Warhammer 40k lore, is there any units or factions or hero's you like to see in any media? like games or shows, animation etc?
[2022-12-31 09:32:38] <!SaucyArts> Well take IronMan for example some sceens he wasnt wearing the suit just red mocap suit they just cgied the suit on venaSip
[2022-12-31 09:32:39] <flufball_> First Edition Space Hulk was better crreamRiot
[2022-12-31 09:32:39] <+Guardian452> @rockinrobyn4077 to be fair space marin e armor is POWER armor, no cosplayers have done THAT yet i think
[2022-12-31 09:32:54] <+DDPrime> All Space Marines is going to be expensive, they'll probably show a lot of Guard or Inq
[2022-12-31 09:33:07] <%Varanid> and the occasional White Dwarf lore dump

[2022-12-31 09:33:55] <+pwnstar87> Start small. Have MAYBE one space marine, give him the presence of the Emperor himself. Only imply the greatness of the primarchs and the emperor

[2022-12-31 09:34:37] <+Inyobase> will probably be an eisenhorn adaptation, space marines will make light showings. mainly guard/inquisitor human stories.
[2022-12-31 09:34:47] <$Ember_Marigold> the real question is, who will Henry Cavill play?
[2022-12-31 09:34:50] <%kimba274> @sshen13 Yes! gave me nightmares, MY BOLTER IS JAMMED!
[2022-12-31 09:34:51] <Joren456> cant have just one space marine unless you kill off his squad
[2022-12-31 09:35:10] <%Oppai_Nani> @Ember_Marigold Spoilers someone important Kappa
[2022-12-31 09:35:17] <%Varanid> the first show needs to be about normal humans and talk about Marines but not focus on them. Inquisition detective story would be good. Maybe only reveal a Marine in like final episode of season 1

[2022-12-31 09:36:06] <$Ember_Marigold> they literally invented that tech for LOTR
[2022-12-31 09:36:07] <Nimmerlein> good old bimbo bangerpants
[2022-12-31 09:36:20] <$Imperialfists7> get rid of live action, and budget turns to 1/4 the cost

[2022-12-31 09:36:36] <+Inyobase> some of the more haardcore ones use stilts
[2022-12-31 09:36:38] <+ThePointGaming> the series needs to be focused on either guard or inquisitors
[2022-12-31 09:36:43] <NeaNelu> how about the line of sight technique where the space marines are closer to the camera.. don't know how it's called
[2022-12-31 09:36:44] <%Fairlight_Excalibur> They also had some 3 foot tall dude from India who wore a silicone mold of Elijah Wood's face for scenes where stood right next to Gandalf LUL

[2022-12-31 09:37:00] <%+jasonmball> the world of warcraft movie did a decent job
[2022-12-31 09:37:05] <sshen13> if they want to appeal to casuals, first one has to be space marines - that is the most recognisable figure of 40k
[2022-12-31 09:37:15] <%+N8sters> Theres people IRL cosplaying actual height space marines. Stilts in foam armour are a thing
[2022-12-31 09:37:16] <InstantExpert> basketball buddies?
[2022-12-31 09:37:26] <%$Strange_Inquiries> I think story lines revolving around the Imperial guard which will be much more doable than anything dealing with the space marines.
[2022-12-31 09:37:26] <+reddjarum> Eisenhorn will be a good starting point , the story was written for people new to 40k
[2022-12-31 09:37:43] <+Validantes> They could do Gaunt's Ghosts

[2022-12-31 09:39:02] <ActualHempKnight> Prophet_242 Not super buggy, but performance isn't great and it's very clearly an unfinished game. They even have "coming soon" stuff in the game, but it's rolling out slooooow.

[2022-12-31 09:39:03] <%Varanid> it wont be about Space Marines. It'll be guardsmen, astropaths, inquisition -- all human sized people. we'll get a glimpse of a an enhanced person at some point but no focus

[2022-12-31 09:41:02] <$Imperialfists7> abnett has long comic chops, could easily propostion amazon on a story
[2022-12-31 09:41:05] <friegolit> Having a Inquisition focus on a series would be smart since they move around a lot and could prevent a show from going too stale
[2022-12-31 09:41:05] <%xen_mind> the betrayal at Istaavan 5 and the start of the Heresy would be an amazing start

[2022-12-31 09:43:11] <%+Enigmal> I don't see the Emperor being cast burke.  The Emperor in the 40k is la McGuffin, a story device.. he doesnt need to be anything more

[2022-12-31 09:43:21] <%Varanid> Guardsmen, Inquisition, Astropaths, Psykers, Sisters of Battle -- all can be done with little cgi. and have a full story that makes sense in lore. Save your 'wow Space Marines' for a brief tease to next season or another show

[2022-12-31 09:55:08] <%xen_mind> Well because the push for diversity is a political act right?

[2022-12-31 09:56:46] <%Twisted_Steel> Rey was terrible, she got mary sued. She just became powerful over night.
[2022-12-31 09:56:52] <+GenXg_> can you play this solo Burke or do you need 2 play it multiplayer?
[2022-12-31 09:56:53] <bakagundam> I mean, the second movie was a COPLETELY different writing crew
[2022-12-31 09:57:02] <%+GangstersPairOfDice> That’s a simile arc to like skywalker though. He didn’t exactly earn it either

[2022-12-31 09:57:09] <+reddjarum> Rey is the most powerful Jedi to ever exist

[2022-12-31 09:57:14] <InstantExpert> ripley is a warrior mom, can't have those in current climate Pepega
[2022-12-31 09:57:19] <friegolit> The problem I see with a lot of series is that the writers hand too much freely to a female protagonist and tend to stunt their “hero’s journey”, which is a big no-no
[2022-12-31 09:57:29] <%Twisted_Steel> @Imperialfists7 So was Luke but he still had to learn
[2022-12-31 09:57:31] <N7Lawson> I don't understand the hate towards the Willow show, they are actually doing a good job showing the training and the lead learning things

[2022-12-31 09:58:55] <friegolit> I’m still fascinated over how badly Disney shat the bed with the new trilogy. You’d think that they would have locked everything down HARD before even letting the writers out of their rooms

[2022-12-31 09:59:02] <%Fairlight_Excalibur> Comparing Rey to Luke is pure silliness. Luke went a foreign planet, trained for months and months and months, and then still gets owned by Vader and crippled. Rey picks up a lightsaber and wins Pepega
[2022-12-31 09:59:11] <Rembrano> She had Palpatine juice in her.

[2022-12-31 09:59:40] <%PaizenCakes> New Hope to Return was quite a while. Luke in the first movie was like 17. In Return he's like 30.

[2022-12-31 12:13:16] <%+shadowoflight_> so it will always go back and forth... you can't stop orders from being being creative, but you don't want people to rip off of you too

[2022-12-31 12:14:19] <%Mikkmerd> let's just disagree both
[2022-12-31 12:14:19] <%Fairlight_Excalibur> People who sell fanart usually do so behind private commissions, which makes it impossible to track the transactions. Doubt you will find artists with fanart galleries for sale.
[2022-12-31 12:14:22] <%xen_mind> but surely these are orignal design @inspired@ by 40k

[2022-12-31 12:15:29] <+AlindBack> GW gets away with locking down these sorts of things because they have money and lawyers, meanwhile most of these people making the stuff can't fight it in court, so bow to GW's whims rather than let a court actually decide if it's legal.

[2022-12-31 13:24:52] <%+Spellbot5000> Seems about right, but the focal depth on your cam makes you look a little big when you're up close, and then a lot smaller when you lean back.
[2022-12-31 13:25:00] <@%xReadyAimMissx> right now, you look like a little kid sitting at the grown ups table.
[2022-12-31 13:25:01] <+KenJ2JR> Id say add a few swordfish or cutlass or something on the wall and its good
