[2022-12-31 06:23:52] <%$JamesTownBrown> @AC_ThirtySix until recently VOIP wasnt a thing, so they were the same. There are locked things that without a pick you cant access in D&D. Survival mechnics are spread across so many different games mostly for no reason so im not going to accept that. Tarkov and D&D dont benefit off of that.

[2022-12-31 06:55:47] <sleepyypt> @chrizat I am slightly confused man, but an item without the FIR marker means someone brought it into the raid. Usually an item that spawns in raid has the marker if am not mistaken

[2022-12-31 06:55:53] <brogsy_> for it to stay found in raid you have to survive with it
[2022-12-31 06:56:04] <brogsy_> if you put it in your butt and die it loses FIR status

[2022-12-31 06:56:38] <%KritterKyle> @chrizat if you die, or if it's a run through, meaning you didn't get enough xp in the raid, the items lose "found in raid" status.

[2022-12-31 09:20:07] <%TheNecromi> As the flagship to the "Looter Extractor" style games, i think it's pretty important to have everything at peak. If not, they need to communicate clearly that theyre aware of it.

[2022-12-31 09:20:30] <nick___991> the last 3 wipes in a row the audio has changed. If I recall correctly the audio behind you was buggy last wipe where it was much quieter than noise coming from other directions, but maybe I'm not remembering that correctly.

[2022-12-31 14:15:04] <+Soraffe> So it might be harsh but my solution is, if you report someone for cheating, that account should get insta-banned and then someone should review it and decide to un-ban. That would stop people from cheating since 1 report would cut them off of the game for a few days. Yeah it'll hurt the legit players and it'll get abused at first and then would die down.

[2022-12-31 14:17:17] <JacksonBrownPants> The problem with reporting specifically on Tarkov is Tarkov is so easy to suspect cheaters because of how quickly you can be killed. Hackusations are rife in this game because most people just don't understand.

[2022-12-31 14:23:16] <%+Dyn4miteHarry> mop floor then you can upgrade with it i think

[2022-12-31 16:56:30] <%$buffer_overflow> Edge is good now. Its based on Crhome.
[2022-12-31 16:56:31] <%+Furiak> edge is basically chrome
[2022-12-31 16:56:31] <Bulltank> Edge is probably the best browser on the market right now
[2022-12-31 16:56:33] <%biggiesghost> @Sequisha For me, if I right click anywhere on the page, I can mute individual tabs on Chrome, no extension/mod or anything. Might work for you. Clicking the tab itself doesn't do it
[2022-12-31 16:56:38] <%phillip_mckrevasse> Only ever used Edge
[2022-12-31 16:56:39] <Truffle_xd> Edge is elite imo.

[2022-12-31 16:57:03] <Bulltank> You have to disable Bing when you install Edge. But Edge pays you to use Bing which you can then use for free xbox game pass
[2022-12-31 16:57:16] <%sudo_noms> Opera is also good
[2022-12-31 16:57:20] <Totzo> as far as I know you don't need an extension in chrome, but you have to enable an option in the chrome settings

[2022-12-31 17:06:55] <+zorkelive> @Sequisha happy you have the balls to call it out, most streamers ignore it and say it doesnt exist
[2022-12-31 17:06:57] <%+its_falven> Yeah because bsg hasn't done shit about radar or anything for ages. They dont give a shit @Sequisha

[2022-12-31 17:07:18] <%jinxplayer> Nikita doesnt want to get rid of the flea market because the RMT actually earn them a lot of money in buying licenses.

[2022-12-31 17:07:20] <%michaelbux> I could never play this game. I‚Äôd lose it. The rampant cheating is brutal to endure!

[2022-12-31 17:07:34] <%+xstarkerxo> they just ban some every quarter to make it look like they are keeping up with it, but ultimately cheaters have to buy the game again to cheat so it pads their numbers
[2022-12-31 17:07:34] <%Maethra> @magazinereloader there were already some cheats popping up at the end of the last test

[2022-12-31 17:10:32] <+TenebruhTV> people get banned modding texture packs in mmos that don't allow it all the time.
[2022-12-31 17:10:33] <magpie_81> maybe they just use a checksum, and you can fake that once you know the sum it is looking for

[2022-12-31 17:31:40] <burritohead> same
[2022-12-31 17:31:41] <%Maethra> it really is a weird change
[2022-12-31 17:31:41] <reformedandy69> yeah
[2022-12-31 17:31:43] <%sanyassan> NikC is fix
[2022-12-31 17:31:43] <%chunkypandabubs> i liked open chests
[2022-12-31 17:31:45] <%+Jammos> Does seem very weird
[2022-12-31 17:31:47] <%+BigDan1992> The only logical reason would be if loot respawned
[2022-12-31 17:31:49] <%Maethra> they could
[2022-12-31 17:31:49] <+OiledPelicanEgg> it was "supposedly" a bug that it stayedopen
[2022-12-31 17:31:49] <%SVTSteve> it's annoying when playing with a squad, hitting the same box as my teammate LUL
[2022-12-31 17:31:51] <Zoxjib> it feels so weird that a ghost closes the container for you 2 seconds after youve left it monkaS
[2022-12-31 17:31:52] <%stevechorizo> it's one of the changes that I really can't stand
[2022-12-31 17:31:53] <+Kingblockrunner> for real
[2022-12-31 17:32:01] <%+TWITCHpoker> They might have a contract that they are stuck in @Sequisha
[2022-12-31 17:32:03] <%Brain_Dont> easy way to track where players have been, maybe to mix the game up. Not saying your theory isn't valid
[2022-12-31 17:32:03] <%+Jammos> It was nice to know you arent wasting your time looting filing cabinets etc
[2022-12-31 17:32:06] <%The_RandyBoBandy> convinced cheating is an inside job 100%
[2022-12-31 17:32:06] <%King_Salami> oh yeah
[2022-12-31 17:32:06] <TheGoatPrince> they definitely need something better than battle eye
[2022-12-31 17:32:08] <%+Hostile_HK_Army> apparently it was causing multiple instances of the game and causing desync
[2022-12-31 17:32:08] <arise92> make it closed for more anticipation ceezFocus
[2022-12-31 17:32:10] <PuffNstuf> I feel like battleeye has been bad since Arma 2
[2022-12-31 17:32:11] <%Sledge_90> We need some VAC bans up in here
[2022-12-31 17:32:14] <%DagBTW> At least give another company a shot at fixing the issue bc battleye isn't cutting it
[2022-12-31 17:32:16] <%stevechorizo> so much time is wasted looting looted containers
[2022-12-31 17:32:18] <%+GirthBrooks1463> lol over there who knows

[2022-12-31 17:32:23] <%+dDeadFish> @stevechorizo totally agree
[2022-12-31 17:32:24] <%+Johnwillcox2> If it was looted before you joined raid it will be closed
[2022-12-31 17:32:26] <%The_RandyBoBandy> these fuckos do it for the money

[2022-12-31 17:32:33] <%+D4n_Solo> I suppose they might have a contract, but I can't image Battle Eye are hitting theirs KPIs so could be grounds to void it.
[2022-12-31 17:32:34] <ItsExsentricx> Is it the same extraction point every time on each map or does it change? What stop people from camping extractions?
[2022-12-31 17:32:39] <+collectingcollects> cheaters killed pubg and their anti cheat did nothing.
[2022-12-31 17:32:40] <+TheDiggyMan> @Sequisha BattleState only protects accounts from being hacked
[2022-12-31 17:32:44] <JaynisK> The description of the open/closed loot change, labeled it as an "issue" Like they considered it a bug or something for some whack reason. elaHmm

[2022-12-31 17:32:54] <+its_just_boro> They want more money
[2022-12-31 17:32:57] <thesnakebeaterson> But what about more money??!!
[2022-12-31 17:32:57] <%+Trishman> let's make an online petition seqKEK

[2022-12-31 17:33:00] <+Comrade_Reaper> spent a lot on their series tho
[2022-12-31 17:33:03] <nolace> cocaine and hookers aren't cheap
[2022-12-31 17:33:06] <%09aaman> plus all the money from cheaters that have to rebuy the game
[2022-12-31 17:33:06] <Zoxjib> devs are russian too. game sold in USD, employee salaries paid in rubles and sunflower seeds...
[2022-12-31 17:33:08] <friesengeist> buy cheats - band more accounts - business
[2022-12-31 17:33:20] <%Disindjinnuous> They gave themselves insane bonuses
[2022-12-31 17:33:21] <GeoSourge> i won EOD in deadlyslobs channel, have yet to play the game EZ
[2022-12-31 17:33:29] <@%$Jifx> The scary fact of the matter is Battlestate makes a LOT of money off cheaters
[2022-12-31 17:33:30] <+RubDubDucky> Conspiracy: They don't fix it because hackers buy new accounts when they get banned. NODDERS  @Sequisha
[2022-12-31 17:33:30] <%+Gharbzadegi> you are leaving out the bill all the vodka needed for the development tho Kappa Kappa
[2022-12-31 17:33:33] <%+GirthBrooks1463> and buckwheat...thats only for youf amuly if you die
[2022-12-31 17:33:33] <%+xstarkerxo> if I had a serious theory on the loot being kept closed, it would be to keep people from seeing loot is open and just running through to the next area, slows down gameplay potentially and makes people have more chances to fight if they are searching through loot more @sequisha
[2022-12-31 17:33:34] <reformedandy69> This wipe I just randomly stop hearing bush noises LUL
[2022-12-31 17:33:44] <csabai> CorgiDerp
[2022-12-31 17:33:45] <Zoxjib> Diablo 2 monetization strategy since the 90s :)
[2022-12-31 17:33:54] <%+WeatheredMachine> @ItsExsentricx I believe it changes but it's a static list of extracts to choose from that you can escape through each match - and there are still campers
[2022-12-31 17:33:55] <L0k0c0c0> battle eye are just sitting with theit thumb up their ass. ffs  the game is filled with hackers day 1 of the wipe
[2022-12-31 17:33:58] <TheGoatPrince> the open containers was a desync bug, that would happen when new players joined the raid ( scavs )but the networking code had not updated the containers that they were closed.it wasn't that they just changed it so that containers are closed always after looting. they were always supposed to be closed after looting. Chatting
[2022-12-31 17:34:00] <%+D4n_Solo> I'm sure there's more they could be doing to prevent repeat offenders too which anecdotally I could imagine is a major problem.
[2022-12-31 17:34:05] <%+dDeadFish> My thinking is if I where Battlestate I'd release my own hacks that fuck up people system, Id put out so many that people would be shy about installing them
[2022-12-31 17:34:05] <%+BigDan1992> They probably wait to ban people so they are more likely to buy another copy if they give them enough time
[2022-12-31 17:34:11] <%+Gillendor> Dude it may boil down to money but in a different way.
[2022-12-31 17:34:14] <beepbeepimajeepHD> its crazy ppl pay $110 a week for cheats
[2022-12-31 17:34:15] <%+Hostile_HK_Army> @Sequisha apparently it was causing multiple instances of the game and causing desync
[2022-12-31 17:34:17] <Grebberson> @ItsExsentricx It can be different depending on where you spawn. Generally, your extract(s) are opposite the map from where you spawn, but there are some static extracts as well.
[2022-12-31 17:34:19] <%+mageximu> because I really like opening empty containers KEKW
[2022-12-31 17:34:21] VIEWERS: 6¬†085
[2022-12-31 17:34:21] <+Spetsmaz> you should just have an option to reclose the loot so it doesn't look looted if you want to look stealthy
[2022-12-31 17:34:22] <thesnakebeaterson> Yeah but if everything gets banned fast then people will stop using cheats and go into the ban>buy cycle
[2022-12-31 17:34:23] <%+GirthBrooks1463> the devs are sneaky who knows lmao
[2022-12-31 17:34:25] <%+xstarkerxo> but yes, Def see it as a way to keep getting a symbiotic relationship with the cheaters
