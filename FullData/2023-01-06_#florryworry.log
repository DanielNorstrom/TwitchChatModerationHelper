[2023-01-06 13:26:26] <@%IAIWE> Making a copypasta is easy. First you see a text you like. Then you take out your phone, and take a picture f it. You then upload that picture to the internet, and download a program that can turn text from a picture in to a copypastable text. You then paste that in to Microsoft Word, and open a new window (to reddit). Then you type the exact thing in the reddit thread as it is in Microsoft Word. EZ Clap

[2023-01-06 19:02:55] <%+zeusbright> Dynasty will be gone by the time you got to Europe
[2023-01-06 19:02:56] <jaboh97> and start as Montferrat?
[2023-01-06 19:02:59] <%+DarkFV> @Florryworry but if you release you wont have dinasty!!!
[2023-01-06 19:03:00] <@%Elrassel> Ming will never lose the land Clueless
[2023-01-06 19:03:06] <%Zembar_> until ming blows up...

[2023-01-06 19:03:23] <%Zembar_> @Florryworry you don't need the dynasty to form if you flip greek
[2023-01-06 19:03:25] <DeepNguyen> Maybe only way is exodus
[2023-01-06 19:03:27] <KnightOfB7R> Whats important about montferrat dynasty?
[2023-01-06 19:03:29] <@%Mephastus> @Florryworry Zembar was saying that you can bypass the Dynasty by being Greek culture. Test that rq?
[2023-01-06 19:03:30] <AWellTrainedFerret> why is the dynasty important?
[2023-01-06 19:03:31] <Iloveflorry> you can hope they dont unite
[2023-01-06 19:03:37] <6HavoK9> you can just introduce it.. montferrat it is :(
[2023-01-06 19:03:37] <yar3_yar3> !montferrat
[2023-01-06 19:03:37] <@^Nightbot> yar3_yar3 Starting nation is montferrat, because it is the only nation that can form Byzantium without correct culture/religion
[2023-01-06 19:03:37] <ariel_zohar> good run this time?
[2023-01-06 19:03:39] <Aigars_LV> @Florryworry you might have to get loans since you will need to move capital to asia
[2023-01-06 19:03:39] <Umturock> Is that dynasty one of locals of motferrat? can we check florri
[2023-01-06 19:03:45] <Chanj005> @KnightOfB7R Required to form byz
[2023-01-06 19:03:47] <%ImaRat> but u can reform byz as long as u are greek culture?
[2023-01-06 19:03:48] <%+DarkFV> @AWellTrainedFerret cant form byz without the right dinasty
[2023-01-06 19:03:48] <홀하 (cgw1462)> Okayge
[2023-01-06 19:03:53] <%hydrogenior> Start as Byz and then release and play as? To have dynasty
[2023-01-06 19:03:57] <mbay16> dynasty important anyway for RP purposes peepoRiot
[2023-01-06 19:04:03] <EroSalahmandra> but you only need the ideia in montfeerrat to form byz @Florryworry
[2023-01-06 19:04:05] <%galgamus> @Florryworry could start as rtugal and get the dynasty
