[2022-12-08 14:07:43] <Redrum_> retail sucks worked at a ross for way too long
[2022-12-08 14:07:45] <%JaggedNA> Did all that shit at Target too. Costco was probably more insane
[2022-12-08 14:07:49] <%+dud3itsj3ff> I do not miss it at all vissLUL
[2022-12-08 14:08:19] <%typicaluser> I always hear good things about working at Costco, not the case?
[2022-12-08 14:08:22] <Roids510> I heard homeless and junkies would just go to town in the restrooms at my local Costco .
[2022-12-08 14:08:32] <kay96_> i worked at an arena as a rink rat, the most canadian thing LUL
[2022-12-08 14:09:31] <%DiFL_8> I don’t think I could ever work in retail, mainly because I have people
[2022-12-08 14:09:46] <o_shiners_o> Everyone should work a retail job at least once in their lifetime.
[2022-12-08 14:09:46] <+generalchad> That sounds normal for retail. Either you go management or work until you can't stand
[2022-12-08 14:09:57] <%typicaluser> got it. I never did retail. Or fast food. Lucked out there but really fucked up enlisting to be on a submarine. So I got mine.
[2022-12-08 14:11:02] <%AngryJ0hn> @o_shiners_o TRUE
[2022-12-08 14:11:10] <HAYNICK> I think sports athletes in professionals should have to live in a studio apartment and work a fast food/retail job for a year before playing in the league. Get some respect for the world and what they're given.
[2022-12-08 14:11:19] <o_shiners_o> You learn a lot, see some weird ass funky shit ansld learn a lot of life lessons.
[2022-12-08 14:11:31] <%+deadguy79> @typicaluser Sales, foodservice, nah. Put me in an underwater death tube
[2022-12-08 14:11:39] <%AngryJ0hn> my uncle waited tables in college and he is the best tipper LMAO
[2022-12-08 14:12:03] <o_shiners_o> When you make it in life, you can look back on those shitty jobs and appreciate the grind more.
[2022-12-08 14:12:19] <Roids510> Zach Mid Wilson came up from money
[2022-12-08 14:12:30] <%sinisterriffle> never worked retail myself. I've always worked in matching shops, and I've been in the industry going on 11 years now.
[2022-12-08 14:12:38] <%billnyessecondcousin5594> I worked retail from 16 until I was 25 almost
[2022-12-08 14:12:46] <%billnyessecondcousin5594> it sucks lol
[2022-12-08 14:12:52] <%typicaluser> @typicaluser and I did a 6 yr contract instead of 4 because I had one year of training, so they wanted 1 more year of service... what idiot would sign for that? This guy.

[2022-12-08 14:32:13] <+Reaperr1_> I just had 3 mediums drop from a stronghold
[2022-12-08 14:32:27] <+trollestcoaster> I found a backpack on a shelf in a warehouse in the bottom left PoI, but doesn't seem super common
[2022-12-08 14:32:50] <Swagmeus> I'm about to play this game, is DMZ better for solo play or?
[2022-12-08 14:32:59] <%+Danwhy666> Do backpacks come in all sizes? Small, Medium, etc?
[2022-12-08 14:33:06] <%billnyessecondcousin5594> finding a 'large' backpack is like hitting the lotto
[2022-12-08 14:33:23] <+BiggusBENJA> @Swagmeus DMZ is hard for solo play
[2022-12-08 14:33:35] <+trollestcoaster> @Danwhy666 Medium and Large. You could consider Small the one you start with, I guess
[2022-12-08 14:33:35] <%billnyessecondcousin5594> @Danwhy666 medium and large. I guess what you start off with could be considered a small
[2022-12-08 14:33:46] <%Gratchinsson> @billnyessecondcousin5594 then you find one in DMZ and then lose it to a team of Rats by the Exfil. FeelsBadMan

[2022-12-08 14:34:41] <%+hazardous_waste24> @swagmeus the AI are relentless on dmz and that usually what I die to on dmz more than actual players
[2022-12-08 14:35:09] <%billnyessecondcousin5594> they're OP as shit right now
[2022-12-08 14:35:11] <+ctrizzytrout> If you have a team DMZ is great to level weapons
[2022-12-08 14:35:12] <%billnyessecondcousin5594> makes you think twice for sure

[2022-12-08 14:58:53] <%Gratchinsson> I love the back pedal too "I said probably not"
[2022-12-08 14:59:21] <%+crispy4kid> @tsm_viss have you thought about using stims for when you get in a gunfight or wanna push somebody? What’s your thought on those?
[2022-12-08 14:59:46] <+ODRevelation> Good morning to you all
[2022-12-08 14:59:52] <%+oshiebichar> They don't make em like they used to
[2022-12-08 14:59:57] <%Tartug> Stims seem pretty useless in this game atm. They were great in WZ1
[2022-12-08 15:00:03] <%Enchaladito> stims are such a goofy playstyle as well
[2022-12-08 15:00:27] <%+oshiebichar> They don't really work in the gas anymore either
[2022-12-08 15:00:48] <royce_russo> I feel the ground loot is pretty solid, whatcha think viss?
[2022-12-08 15:00:48] <NoodleLegsJ> they arent even that great in the zone
[2022-12-08 15:00:59] <Comatron_TV> snapshit is good
[2022-12-08 15:01:01] <Comatron_TV> shot
[2022-12-08 15:01:03] <Comatron_TV> Kappa
[2022-12-08 15:01:46] <%+crispy4kid> Well looks like I need to change my shit!! I literally run stims every time I play
[2022-12-08 15:01:58] <%+crispy4kid> Don’t Judge.
[2022-12-08 15:02:14] <%Gratchinsson> @crispy4kid the real Q is, do they work for you and your play style
[2022-12-08 15:02:43] <%+crispy4kid> @gratchinsson They keep me alive.
[2022-12-08 15:03:05] <Comatron_TV> @crispy4kid in dmz stims are good, cuz when you get smashed by AI, they usually dont instakill, just bring you down really low and the ist really good to stim up when they get close
[2022-12-08 15:03:12] <%Gratchinsson> @crispy4kid sounds like you use them and they work for you. I'd not change it. If it aint broke dont fix it
[2022-12-08 15:03:35] <%Gratchinsson> @Comatron_TV no joke, Stims can be a life saver in a world of 1 plate armors
[2022-12-08 15:03:37] <Comatron_TV> but in warzone, use snapshots early game for clear and smokes are must for endgame
[2022-12-08 15:03:54] <%+oshiebichar> I thought he was a bot he died so fast
[2022-12-08 15:04:26] <%billnyessecondcousin5594> guy wanted to try out the boat in the wrong place
[2022-12-08 15:04:28] <serpentijn> i guess he took the most bad timing to go to the shop today..
[2022-12-08 15:04:38] <%+crispy4kid> Nice fucking shots!!
[2022-12-08 15:04:48] <%+oshiebichar> Does he stay in the boat when he gets downed?
[2022-12-08 15:04:59] <Comatron_TV> smokes are pretty useful in this game they pop fast, have decent area and last enough
[2022-12-08 15:05:59] <%+TexAgKyle> this scope show up with a glare?
[2022-12-08 15:06:21] <%+oshiebichar> I think it has a small glint

[2022-12-08 16:09:23] <%+dud3itsj3ff> I’ve heard rumors San Fran might pick up baker, but idk if he could win the job if they did
[2022-12-08 16:09:23] <%ProjectKoike> As an Iowa State alum/fan/employee I always thought he was overrated, so good for him
[2022-12-08 16:09:34] <%+dud3itsj3ff> He was not great in Carolina lol

[2022-12-08 16:10:50] <%+xxMisterFolgersxx> @tsm_viss in a die hard Bucs fan. this is known. if the coaching staff doesn't get out of Brady's way the 49ers led by Brock Purtty going to kill the bucs
[2022-12-08 16:11:06] <%+DowneyMojo39> He’s on IR so min 4 games

[2022-12-08 16:13:24] <+jHussle> my fav NFL storyline of the season is SEA trading Russ and getting a potential (as it sits) top 5 pick in return, while also making the playoffs
