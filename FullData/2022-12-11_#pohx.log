[2022-12-11 00:00:31] <TheRemedy> hmm ok thanks chat. i will live in my bubble of blissful ignorance. FeelsGoodMan
[2022-12-11 00:00:39] <no123450n> is league content worth doing or is it post launch fixer-upperᵗᵐ?

[2022-12-11 00:01:37] <+Etainz> @no123450n I think it's fun ok
[2022-12-11 00:01:48] <+droptastic> 11 hours 8 minutes to go to maps with Jugg. Not bad I guess since I never started a league with anything but a witch :D
[2022-12-11 00:01:49] <welchaczep> Oh nice 5l what is the next step regarding that armour?

[2022-12-11 00:02:07] <SilverkissTwitch> @TheRemedy Spiritual Aid makes "all increases to minion damage affect you". Therefore "10% increased minion damage" becomes "10% increased damage" for you. That means it works on any kind of damage that you do
[2022-12-11 00:02:09] <+bluefrenchy> liking the league mechanic so far???
[2022-12-11 00:02:14] <Tynex94> !atlas
[2022-12-11 00:02:17] <The_Real_Imso> I didn't understand it either in the video, until I read the spell myself :  Spiritual aid : "Increase to minion damage, ALSO AFFECT YOU" :)
[2022-12-11 00:02:25] <+actavis89> how are you applying flammability with only 18 mana? does hextouch bypass the mana req?

[2022-12-11 00:02:53] <+UndeadZX> @actavis89 yes, hextouch applies off the other spell cast so no need to have enough for the flammability spell
[2022-12-11 00:02:53] <kitoqn> did u like brass dome ?
[2022-12-11 00:02:57] <@%lemoncoolers> I think those new abyss nodes are busted. Especially with drops the way they are. So many rares and magics

[2022-12-11 00:03:50] <flaxenwall4251> inb4 jugg gets nerfed because people like to play it
[2022-12-11 00:03:51] <lothreg> I'm genuinely surprised GGG hasn't target nerfed you yet @Pohx KEKLEO
[2022-12-11 00:03:54] <+UndeadZX> to be fair, any spell on a marauder feels better than melee leveling
[2022-12-11 00:03:56] <lothreg> maybe they'll do it for poe2 monkaW
[2022-12-11 00:03:58] <+Silver9s> magma booger flicker
[2022-12-11 00:04:04] <flaxenwall4251> they did the 50% on inq

[2022-12-11 00:04:09] <+CapitanoObvioso> @Pohx Why not go for emperor of purity cards like you did for inquis?

[2022-12-11 00:04:29] <kherbb> "and here we have marauder (look at those muscles, oof) a staple melee class , and he is using... oh ... whats this , a spell???? well im sure he knows what he is doing "  as chris wilson shows gameplay to a journalist
[2022-12-11 00:04:33] <lothreg> you're having too much fun, ggg hates fun, obvious outcome, RF nerfed to the ground
[2022-12-11 00:04:53] <lothreg> you can phase that boss @Pohx

[2022-12-11 00:05:03] <lothreg> though idk how you phased it with a 4link
[2022-12-11 00:05:04] <%+TheMyrr> @Pohx Few people have left such a solid mark on a game as you have on PoE. You will leave behind a great legacy! :)

[2022-12-11 01:34:54] <%+kupruu> I have to say that it is so nice to watch while playing the same build. especially since I don't know much about items in poe.. had no idea about saffels shield but now I do! :D
[2022-12-11 01:34:56] <@^StreamElements> I've setup a Nexus Game Store --> https://www.nexus.gg/Pohx You can find games I've played through & Recommend here!
[2022-12-11 01:35:04] <%+x_R3DZ1K_x> @HeartBreaker75 you have all points in atlas and all gems included in pob? i dind have a problem at all
[2022-12-11 01:35:07] <+ReinVorlind> I read the guide, followed the instructions, and everything is working. What do I do?
[2022-12-11 01:35:14] <Rikkycurtis> is increased fire craft or fire dot multi better?
[2022-12-11 01:35:26] <%krixiis> would love to do lab. no trials yet
[2022-12-11 01:35:33] <MandM1337> should i be doing chaos recipes or waste of time?
[2022-12-11 01:35:34] <%+Paws_97> Strongbox + Infernal Cry= FUN :)
[2022-12-11 01:35:45] <Rikkycurtis> thank you :)
[2022-12-11 01:35:47] <fLipitZ> depends on the amount- get both if you can
[2022-12-11 01:36:00] <%Smeagol001> @krixiis just buy the offering xD
[2022-12-11 01:36:04] <JohnaldReagan> i think you mentioned in a video possibly using staff with rf? will you have pob for that? im levelling with The Searing Touch and curious to see if i can stay staff
[2022-12-11 01:36:07] <habsy1> @HeartBreaker75 stone golem helps
[2022-12-11 01:36:25] <+HeartBreaker75> @HeartBreaker75 I must have transitionned too early, I don't have Stone Golem yet
[2022-12-11 01:36:40] <MandM1337> if i remember correct there was a global channel where people trade the trials right
[2022-12-11 01:36:45] <Sh4dRRR> Is catarina 76lvl doable with ~80% of your damage ?
[2022-12-11 01:36:50] <fLipitZ> -max is no fun on RF--yikes
[2022-12-11 01:37:10] <naklejka69> How much worth is already your build?
[2022-12-11 01:37:21] <habsy1> @HeartBreaker75 yes you get it at the start of act 4
[2022-12-11 01:37:35] <%+FatRat_> I'm realizing that I should've had a specialized filter for my build for a long time, first time I've used a tailored filter and I love it
[2022-12-11 01:37:37] <fLipitZ> well not all skills intentionally burn themselves
[2022-12-11 01:37:40] <%+x_R3DZ1K_x> @HeartBreaker75 there you go my friend, check always pob, there is all what you need to know, check you gear and gems and skill tree
[2022-12-11 01:37:43] <+perezidentt> @Pohx you put more time into your pob and guide than anyone else and it isn't even up for debate. How long does it take you to preapre it for each league on average?
[2022-12-11 01:38:18] <%osbijuu> someone knows whats better to craft in a boot with 3 res+incr armour? mov speed or reg life? THX :)
[2022-12-11 01:38:58] <+HeartBreaker75> @HeartBreaker75 In POB it says you can start RF after Lab. I assumed it was end of Act 3 then ^^'
[2022-12-11 01:39:16] <fLipitZ> your POB is the tits meow
[2022-12-11 01:39:18] <%+hydemin_d> maps are so boring, but necessary..
[2022-12-11 01:39:31] <%+hydemin_d> i know lol
[2022-12-11 01:39:41] <fLipitZ> make your maps exciting- vaal it
[2022-12-11 01:39:47] <habsy1> @HeartBreaker75 yeah, it also says in the lvl 30-40 skill set that stone golem is required when starting rf, but its a bit hidden down there
[2022-12-11 01:39:57] <%+hydemin_d> ive done like 40 maps and cant find anything past t5
[2022-12-11 01:40:00] <+Alcsaar> I found a springleaf around RF time so i was able to swap earlier xD

[2022-12-11 01:40:27] <fLipitZ> You can just barely run RF with the first ascendancy if you have the right gear

[2022-12-11 01:46:19] <pittyh> There is a file in the GGG folder that checks the files, if it's a steam install you can also check the files

[2022-12-11 01:46:33] <+diviripi> you still have a POE window opened, restart the pc or finish it on the processes tab

[2022-12-11 01:47:52] <ultrasuperhyper> @Pohx your rf pobs are so insanely detailed and useful. Decided to finally do rf jugg and once I did lab, leveling was sucha breeze!
[2022-12-11 01:47:52] <Naruto3331> maybe you need to update the game
[2022-12-11 01:47:53] <+diviripi> sometimes the process doesn't appear, or it is something internal, so the best solution is to restart the pc

[2022-12-11 15:42:10] <%VirtualFreedom> @Pohx - Why do we use Swift Affliction when the spell says it doesnt work with RF?
[2022-12-11 15:42:16] <+handfulofslugs> Chat, am I crazy or is that flame exarch mark new?

[2022-12-11 15:44:18] <+TheWadeTuckerX> how is RF doing in the league mechanic?
[2022-12-11 15:45:09] <%kjlhs> pohx did you see ziz's rip last night and the immediate nerf
[2022-12-11 15:45:36] <+bolle_aka_bolle> Living the dream.

[2022-12-11 15:46:38] <+TheWadeTuckerX> @kjlhs what nerf?
[2022-12-11 15:46:47] <MeImoth> Ziz ran into it badly and ate like every projectile of it at once
[2022-12-11 15:46:49] <%kjlhs> i think it was 5 and apparently the mob could shotgun you and did more damage then intended
[2022-12-11 15:47:13] <Virvatar> I just wanted to say a big thank you for the jugg-leveling playthrough, I've been levelling with it on the background. Superb content for a bleb like me who just wants to play and have someone hold my hand :D
[2022-12-11 15:47:13] <lord_zel> hello pohx,hows the new league?
[2022-12-11 15:47:21] <%kjlhs> like 20 mins later they did a patch that nerfed the damage and they are supposed to fix the shotgunning
