[2023-01-03 11:45:56] <@%initiate_bg> to be honest I expected to be banned when I typed "Deserved" the previous game KEKW
[2023-01-03 11:46:17] <@%RedNote_EZ> @initiate_bg i did nothing to that
[2023-01-03 11:46:53] <@%initiate_bg> oh well, it was quite fun this morning :)
[2023-01-03 11:47:13] <@%RedNote_EZ> but congrats on being first rdu mod to get banned on jj

[2023-01-03 14:52:17] <@%R2DU> Regularly, when RDUlive takes a day off, superJJ takes on himself and keeps on steaming. "RDU needs a day off, I'll handle his shift for him", he thinks while playing BGs til his lifeless body falls onto his bed, tired but satisfied to help a friend. "It was worth it, he'd do the same for me" he mutters before passing out. This morning, superJJ took a day off, RDU stayed in bed, resting like nothing ever happened. Sadge
