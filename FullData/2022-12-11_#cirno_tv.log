[2022-12-11 05:09:39] <%+boldCactuslad> oh cirno thats one of the best parts about dwarf fortress... you can abandon a fort, and keep the same world
[2022-12-11 05:09:55] <~%Cirno_TV> oh thats neat
[2022-12-11 05:09:55] <%+boldCactuslad> start a NEW fort away from your current one... and then learn what happened to it later monkaS
[2022-12-11 05:10:04] <~%Cirno_TV> thatsa actually so cool
[2022-12-11 05:10:29] <%+boldCactuslad> yeah you can even recover your lost artifacts (stolen or forgotten) or maybe even some dwarves who got captured

[2022-12-11 05:12:36] <%Soviet5lo> when people say dwarf fortress is overly detailed rimworld on crack they're not kidding
[2022-12-11 05:12:50] <%+boldCactuslad> when your vampire or undead dwarf has been trapped under rubble for 200 years
[2022-12-11 05:12:55] <~%Cirno_TV> thats impressive
[2022-12-11 05:13:23] <%Soviet5lo> casual reminder its just two devs who've been doing this for 20 years
[2022-12-11 05:13:39] <%OhIToot> cirno have you jammed to dankag music yet FumoFlip
[2022-12-11 05:13:47] <%+boldCactuslad> from a probably true story: a fort once fell because a butterfly wing lodged itself in the mechanism of a door, preventing the player from locking it, allowing the enemies inside
[2022-12-11 05:14:16] <%Durandol> no1HMM butterfly wing jamming a lock...
[2022-12-11 05:14:25] <%Durandol> atamMad is that you? lockpick lawyer?
[2022-12-11 05:14:25] <%Soviet5lo> Remember when carp were dangerous, or giant sponges
[2022-12-11 05:14:37] <%+boldCactuslad> it was probably chitinous
[2022-12-11 05:14:51] <%OhIToot> do we tell cirno about the mermaid farm story though
[2022-12-11 05:14:57] <%+boldCactuslad> i dont remember carp being dangerous cirThink
[2022-12-11 05:16:11] <%Soviet5lo> years and years ago where swimming counted as exercise and trained all physical stats...and carp are always swimming

[2022-12-11 05:17:45] <%OhIToot> eh, i don't need life aid i have a billion items DesuOP
[2022-12-11 05:18:18] <%Soviet5lo> giant sponges were funny cause they were massive and heavy and had no body parts and blood so couldn't die
[2022-12-11 05:18:59] <%Soviet5lo> but could somehow push dwarves around crushing bones and killing them by crushing skulls
[2022-12-11 05:19:22] <%+boldCactuslad> woah.
[2022-12-11 05:19:31] <%+boldCactuslad> ive always found empty or squishy enemies (like mud) to be the weakest
[2022-12-11 05:19:48] <%+boldCactuslad> unless they had web. or gas. then all dwarves die.

[2022-12-11 19:49:48] <%+boldCactuslad> eventually i switch from ddim low step size to higher steps with dpm2-something
[2022-12-11 19:50:12] <%+boldCactuslad> pretty good toonfish. for me, the purpose of upsizing over and over again is to save time and ram
[2022-12-11 19:50:20] <@%Toonfish> my current plan after gaining this information is to generate batches of 8 images with low iteration counts and then upsize a few of them by afew more steps and then select the top1/2 to do proper upsizing
[2022-12-11 19:50:25] <@%Toonfish> nice NOTED
[2022-12-11 19:50:39] <%+boldCactuslad> i dont want to fine tune things at 1024x1024 with 90 steps on DPM2. I want to fine tune at 800x800ish with 40steps on euler or fewer with ddim
