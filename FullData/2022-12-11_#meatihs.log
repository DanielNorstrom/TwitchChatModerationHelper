[2022-12-11 00:21:59] <theslappyfellow> @meatihs Ya that’s a big one. Cuz that would elimate 16 damage from the full combo
[2022-12-11 00:22:07] <+datfrogger> @Ryukinshin only tin foil hatters think that
[2022-12-11 00:22:13] <+Reliko> Isnt it working as intended? manathirst alters the battlecry, but does not do damage by itself.

[2022-12-11 00:22:28] <Orzler> I think it working as intended
[2022-12-11 00:22:30] <%+ESCalamity> hey chat, just joined the stream, is the health and cards messed up visually just for me or a bug ?
[2022-12-11 00:22:31] <authorJeMac> 48 dmg still kills most people, especially when you can throw Sire D in the combo
[2022-12-11 00:22:35] <+xcesme> I am scared of this tree
[2022-12-11 00:22:36] <Orzler> the manathirst buffs the battlecry which will be doubled
[2022-12-11 00:22:37] <+kentuky9320> they fixed it it should work normally
[2022-12-11 00:22:44] <Orzler> I thought
[2022-12-11 00:22:44] <+Ryukinshin> Pft, that's what my buddy said. Yet last night I was playing blood DK and running into one druid after another, I switch to druid and I never see another druid or KD again.
[2022-12-11 00:22:48] <+Arkinos7> hey, is there any website/source for meta decks? I'm a returning HS player :)
[2022-12-11 00:22:50] <+Ryukinshin> Just fast aggro and nothing else.
[2022-12-11 00:23:23] <DaggettTheAngryBeaver> @Ryukinshin think a moment about it: Why would such a thing exist? Even more: Is it logically possible? Because for every player who gets a good matchup, another gets a bad one. (zero sum game). So why do you think Blizzard hates you specifically?
[2022-12-11 00:23:27] <Eriadar> wasnt this kinda risky vs ice trap? @MeatiHS
[2022-12-11 00:23:33] <Eriadar> possible one

[2022-12-11 00:23:43] <bitbangboom> theo does sound better
[2022-12-11 00:23:51] <+Ryukinshin> Blizzard doesn't, but apparently I'm really damn unlucky.
[2022-12-11 00:23:51] <Sewipoo> I think the 30 card version of that deck is better no?
[2022-12-11 00:23:54] <authorJeMac> Yeah, im not sure about Daddy Dd post nerf tbh
[2022-12-11 00:23:56] <froxt_bg> maybe we find that card no one thought about yet

[2022-12-11 00:25:21] <+Ryukinshin> But I do feel like the class you play does reduce the chances you run into certain other classes. I don't think it's 100% random.

[2022-12-11 00:25:54] <+KingHarvest> i think it's 100% random because blizzard wouldn't be competent enough to implement a weighting system

[2022-12-11 00:43:03] <glancealot> maybe because he doesn't like to be called juff lol
[2022-12-11 00:43:06] <amundror> low skill streamer cant draw Geoff lol
[2022-12-11 00:43:12] <+IlDaltonico> if he has a jailer u r dead.

[2022-12-11 00:43:38] <Gigglebear77> make it purely play for combo
[2022-12-11 00:43:38] <bitbangboom> basically keep the armor package and astalor

[2022-12-11 00:44:18] <authorJeMac> I do too. I ran into a couple on ladder. And the only thing that mattered was who drew the peices first.
[2022-12-11 00:44:21] <+deft_hpy> there is a 30 card version of it

[2022-12-11 00:44:25] <+levraijeanguy> https://hsreplay.net/decks/Bye09KRTePhLI0ntoqFAMd/#gameType=RANKED_STANDARD this is 30 card deck
[2022-12-11 00:44:33] <authorJeMac> Unless tthey ran Celestial. Which is great in the mirror
[2022-12-11 00:44:36] <coolgarydotnet> is there a chance you cut all the expensive cards so that coldtooth mine tutors out anubrekhan
[2022-12-11 00:44:37] <glancealot> it might not work because you fall to aggro even harder at 30 health
[2022-12-11 00:44:53] <Lekariy> its already invented @MeatiHS https://www.hearthstonetopdecks.com/decks/otk-armor-druid-73-legend-maibaoziqwq-march-of-the-lich-king/

[2022-12-11 00:45:28] <+deft_hpy> yeah the downside of 30 is even worse against aggro but upside is more consistent draw for the combo
[2022-12-11 00:45:35] <authorJeMac> Interesting. It cut Miracle Growths for Dew Process

[2022-12-11 01:00:31] <ricardovgai> you need at least 11 armor to combo in turn 8...

[2022-12-11 01:00:44] <bitbangboom> you need the dew process for rapid card tunrover
[2022-12-11 01:00:47] <authorJeMac> @ricardovgai You don't need any armor.
[2022-12-11 01:00:57] <@%$Raptorheart> Try the 3rd copy of Scales of Onyxia :)
[2022-12-11 01:01:07] <%zozo_ii> @StarIex for a combo deck, it definitelly should be better.
[2022-12-11 01:01:11] <+deft_hpy> guys dew process makes u die faster against aggro
[2022-12-11 01:01:11] <ricardovgai> @authorJeMac if you have 11 armor in turn 8 you can do anub, brann and 5 mana astalor
[2022-12-11 01:01:16] <WizNan> @authorJeMac yes u do for a turn 8 combo
[2022-12-11 01:01:18] <WizNan> rethink

[2022-12-11 01:07:26] <+Brianbgrp> @tedargo if you have 11 mana, it's bran into anub into astalors.
[2022-12-11 01:07:30] <+deft_hpy> right order is ramp armor up draw and combo
[2022-12-11 01:07:32] <+CaptMaro> bran into anub into 5mana alastor into final alastor @tedargo
[2022-12-11 01:07:43] <lore_twitch> what if we cut a lot of the spells and we run quest package?
[2022-12-11 01:07:45] <+Brianbgrp> @tedargo if you don't have 11 mana, you gotta anub into brann and hope you have a bit of armor built up
[2022-12-11 01:07:56] <%+yodacao> 30 card druid seem good Kappa

[2022-12-11 01:22:30] <jungl4thx3> theotar can only come down little bit later now which actually makes card better cause almost everyone misplayed jamming it as soon, but the later you play it more likely to hit key cards so now even bad players have stronger winrate with card

[2022-12-11 01:32:57] <SataintanicVerses> Zola makes no sense because of board space and hand space.
[2022-12-11 01:33:04] <nops___> run naturalize for board space
[2022-12-11 01:33:06] <Secretstreame> Cant mutanus be a good minion with the combo with bran in moments where you havent drawn astor?
[2022-12-11 01:33:09] <LambdadeIta> thats why I run elven archer to kill zola and free board space
[2022-12-11 01:33:13] <danx98> just tech in a living roots to kill ur own zola
