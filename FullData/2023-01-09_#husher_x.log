[2023-01-09 09:07:41] <CiaIsMyWaifu> It's possible it's better there since fillipinos definitely work harder than we do. I know Mcdonalds in Japan is crazy different.   For tim Hortons though, the coffee is just okay, people here are addicted. The French Vanilla is good though, and Ice caps with milk.

The staff was like entirely from the Philippines, and most of them were in the process of immigrating. Eventually they all knew me by name and like, invited me to go to their parties outside work, but I was too shy lmao. Anyway it showed me that Fillipinos, at least those I've met are all super nice
