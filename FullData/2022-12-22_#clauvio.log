[2022-12-22 07:50:33] <%ABC_itsSpyro123> No, men are not allowed to long hair. It is simply not possible, the head overheats and they die
[2022-12-22 07:50:38] <kevs_iloveu> both Styles benefit different people
[2022-12-22 07:50:45] <YuggetNugget> its not the length of the hair its how you use it Kappa

[2022-12-22 12:04:52] <Turret49> Hi Ratyyy
[2022-12-22 12:04:57] <+Bullfrog10> Is there a reason the n64 version instead of 3ds?
[2022-12-22 12:05:05] <UnmovingGreatLibrary> Makes more sense than that abominable intelligence, clauvio; you're good.
[2022-12-22 12:05:23] <+Bullfrog10> aaaaa
[2022-12-22 12:05:30] <@%KafroHudrep> @Bullfrog10 do you know how hard it is to get that to work
[2022-12-22 12:05:30] <+Bullfrog10> that makes more sense then
[2022-12-22 12:05:35] <%MakoFukasame> we were reprogramming an AI with ethical arguments to get a Taun Taun to consent to marrying Jar Jar Binks and then divorcing him so he can marry a fruit rollup
[2022-12-22 12:05:44] <@%KafroHudrep> @MakoFukasame yeah?
[2022-12-22 12:05:46] <+Bullfrog10> @Bullfrog10 im assuming not from 3ds hardware
[2022-12-22 12:05:55] <Ultima_Weapon02> The low framerate adds to authenticity
[2022-12-22 12:05:59] <%MakoFukasame> the AI complained that food cannot consent to marriage

[2022-12-22 12:06:23] <%MakoFukasame> yeah! we managed to convince the AI the taun taun could consent and it described their wedding

[2022-12-22 12:06:40] <%CyOrion> The problem is that it's immoral to marry someone just to divorce them. pieLogic
[2022-12-22 12:06:44] <%MakoFukasame> but we had to specify the divorce was amicable because it wouldn't let them divorce immorally

[2022-12-22 12:07:24] <czerno333> the taun taun was successful, the fruit rollup was not

[2022-12-22 12:07:34] <Ultima_Weapon02> i feel like it depends personally, like in an ideal world id like a nice apple cider donut, but i find alotta places struggle to get the flavor right, that being said, itts very hard to bungle a jelly donut so its a solid backup.

[2022-12-22 12:34:59] <socialistOtter> oh, beans makes sense
[2022-12-22 12:35:05] <!%MintCastella> @socialistOtter i assume it has to do with Special Boots Later . thats my guess
[2022-12-22 12:35:14] <@%KafroHudrep> yeah we never needed soyapoya
[2022-12-22 12:35:17] <socialistOtter> special boots also makes sense
[2022-12-22 12:35:18] <%godot_was_here> the easiest way is backflipping over the fence

[2022-12-22 13:24:13] <BlazeKong64> You're pretty tall so hitting pots will be a bit difficult when swinging horizontal
[2022-12-22 13:24:15] <i_am_jessa> you were _very close_ to getting one
[2022-12-22 13:24:19] <i_am_jessa> a lot earlier
