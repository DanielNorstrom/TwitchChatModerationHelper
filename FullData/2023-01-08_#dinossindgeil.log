[2023-01-08 13:55:26] <%elnombre91> I guess DS2 being really hard at SL1 makes sense because you have no iframes dinossMonka
[2023-01-08 13:55:34] <%staleycameron> You killing him was pretty boss tho
[2023-01-08 13:55:41] <+RickyPax> use torch
[2023-01-08 13:55:44] <IMurky_> @elnombre91 100 is equivalent to DS1 medium roll I think, thats what I fet

[2023-01-08 13:55:49] <%$Doudoussin> Also, you will need to complete the 3 sections but when you'll unlock the boss it's better to run to it from black gulch, way less enemies to deal with in that chasm
[2023-01-08 13:55:57] <$SteveCatFishDog> question: whats the gigalizard marathon?
[2023-01-08 13:55:59] <$grimxreaperxxx> at the moment im working my way up to get the platin trophys for all soulsborne games and so on
[2023-01-08 13:56:03] <%ErrSousa> @elnombre91 You need to focus on Agility not ADP. ADP is one of the stats that controls AGL. If you are a sorcerer for example you will level atunement too and get AGL from there as well.

[2023-01-08 15:15:24] <%LCorazza> also your DEX is lower than Shilkey, so your do less poison build up
[2023-01-08 15:15:28] <GeorgeCadman> but then again his bar is depleting the longer you take obviously
[2023-01-08 15:15:35] <%Mellon_> oh so you are playing the empire then, but its not astartes or mechanicus as such

[2023-01-08 16:48:02] <+Flow_425> after getting the boss achievement chailce dungeons cause me pain
[2023-01-08 16:48:16] <@%a_chu> @xsierraleone There is a solution to your problem. play them yourself Hmmm
[2023-01-08 16:48:20] <%Mellon_> @a_chu quit outs arent allowed in hitless?
[2023-01-08 16:48:21] <%ghastlyfeline> ayooo nico you got ds2. very nice
[2023-01-08 16:48:24] <%+remiri> you have a roll and estus again
[2023-01-08 16:48:27] <+alexcon18> you can wield the qxe you get from the mimic underneath the dragon

[2023-01-08 16:48:38] <%Jaymerax> Hi Nico and chat fifiWaves  Grats on finished DS2 dinossPraise
[2023-01-08 16:48:41] <%akaleth> There's some unique bosses in there but it's just so much of a time sink
[2023-01-08 16:48:42] <%ErrSousa> The chalices can be repetitive if you dont know what you're doing
[2023-01-08 16:48:45] <%elnombre91> leave the chalices to ghost dinossK

[2023-01-08 16:48:54] <tostadoraO0> what do the estus next to the bosses names mean?
[2023-01-08 16:48:55] <@%a_chu> @Mellon_ nope, only at specific points like DS1 once. And you can't reset aggro with quit outs. Big no no
[2023-01-08 16:49:01] <%+remiri> im so ignorant to DS3 lol
[2023-01-08 16:49:04] <%+CaptnDiablo> chalice dungeons have some cool bosses tho

[2023-01-08 16:50:22] <+Aemilius_Korab> Ds3 is probably the best of the trilogy- Sekiro is the best of all time though :)

[2023-01-08 16:50:31] <Dummbatz_> DS2 ♥
[2023-01-08 16:50:32] <+Flow_425> I think DS3 is overall the best Dark Souls but I understand why people would like DS1 more
[2023-01-08 16:50:32] <%Mellon_> DS3 has polish
