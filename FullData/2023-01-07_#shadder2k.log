People say being Genji is Impossible but I don’t care, I can solo carry. I’m having a plastic surgeon install cyborg parts,a shuriken dispenser and a dragonblade on my body. From now on I want you guys to call me “Genji Shimada Senpai” and respect my right to ignore objectives and play team deathmatch. Ryūjin no ken wo kurae!
