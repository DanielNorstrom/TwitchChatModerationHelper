[2022-12-29 17:25:19] <sseolabn> I only play TM for fun. If the map is hard, I still play it regardless how I perform on it unless its fs Aware
[2022-12-29 17:25:20] <%NotEnoughSpeed> marc does have 4k hours in the game tho, but still
[2022-12-29 17:25:23] <%+Atomix2k> Thats basically the same take that people have on the gta san andreas race mod MTA. Maps are getting harder and harder and new people have an insanely hard time getting into those maps and just quit instead of trying
[2022-12-29 17:25:24] <%spiralvgc> i struggled with the black maps but i know thats a me problem ok
[2022-12-29 17:25:27] <FatedToFail> I rarely chat here and sorry for the wall. IMO cotd is advertised as for everyone, so it should be beginner friendly maps with high skill cap. IMO the main problem that there is no official platform for harder maps. Possible solutions: 1. Select a few days of COTD where we know it will be harder maps. 2. Make a cup of the week or sth with harder maps 3. stop saying cotd is for everyone so no complains.
[2022-12-29 17:25:29] <%Silver_star12> I mean you can look so much up on youtube... and also learn from records aswell

[2022-12-29 17:26:17] <%+JetpackSunrise> there's definitely more expectation for games to have better tutorials these days, and i suppose the game could benefit from it... but TM has *needed* that for people to like it, either

[2022-12-29 17:35:09] <+finian1> That's why you need to get a hefty number of votes, I've hear you need at least 50 votes before it's even considered

[2022-12-29 17:35:14] <%NotEnoughSpeed> @Atomix2k also let's not forget that nadeo does not teach beginners anything, tutorial maps are super basic

[2022-12-29 18:18:12] <%spiralvgc> i think most of the tracks this month have been fine except the first ccp one and the ccp track with all the weird transitional jumpy jumps
[2022-12-29 18:18:19] <%Permzilla> problem with those is there is always one route quickest and then everyone just does that
[2022-12-29 18:18:19] <%knudaTM> oneup on that map by shorty that had 2 routes (didnt you win that cotd)
[2022-12-29 18:18:23] <%PRoTrOsss> @IntaxTM that sounds hard
[2022-12-29 18:18:25] <%chekyy> There will always be a fastest round

[2022-12-29 19:51:01] <@%^StreamElements> Back at it again with some 'Track of the Day' author hunting. Check out !medals to see the most difficult author medals in the campaign and my personal best on !midori - Before you ask, https://www.author-tracker.com uses a different medal for Midori compared to the ingame one. The goal is to just gather the available ones slow and steadily.

Check out !medals to see the most difficult author medals in the campaign and my personal best on !midori - Before you ask, https://www.author-tracker.com uses a different medal for Midori compared to the ingame one. The goal is to just gather the available ones slow and steadily.

Check out !medals to see the most difficult author medals in the campaign and my personal best on !midori - Before you ask, https://www.author-tracker.com uses a different medal for Midori compared to the ingame one. The goal is to just gather the available ones slow and steadily.

Check out !medals to see the most difficult author medals in the campaign and my personal best on !midori - Before you ask, https://www.author-tracker.com uses a different medal for Midori compared to the ingame one. The goal is to just gather the available ones slow and steadily.

Check out !medals to see the most difficult author medals in the campaign and my personal best on !midori - Before you ask, https://www.author-tracker.com uses a different medal for Midori compared to the ingame one.
