[2022-12-26 16:10:43] <!%AirahsELL> rhythm games in general have dmca problems. Muse Dash has a "stream safe" mode that gets rid of...90% of the music, which makes it not fun at all.

[2022-12-26 17:04:03] <%+ParanoidCorgi> good game, but not for stream, too many yabs
[2022-12-26 17:04:03] <Redamaford> So there's an item that lets you put pretty much any image on it, and I am 100% sure people would troll you with that as well.
[2022-12-26 17:04:04] <ShoMibu> Its like counter strike source.
[2022-12-26 17:04:04] <Komfigaming> not good for stream unless you know the game already

[2022-12-26 17:17:08] <%Furudehan> Warcraft is a Blizzard franchise.
[2022-12-26 17:17:08] <%UsernameNotFoundErr> It's a cult, once you learn about warhammer, you've been initiated and can now hear/see it all
[2022-12-26 17:17:09] <Vore> Sure yeah
[2022-12-26 17:17:09] <%PigWithoutProtection> the warhammer universe is pretty old but was kinda niche

[2022-12-26 17:17:23] <!%AirahsELL> Yesn't. Blizzard was licensed by Games Workshop to make Warhammer Fantasy and 40k games. The deal fell through but Blizz was too far along to scrap them so we got Warcraft and Starcraft.
[2022-12-26 17:17:37] <%+Savage_Maelstrom> The warhammer people talk about it all the time, and then when people stop indulcing them, they go quiet about it for a while, until a thing happens that they can be like "OH ITS JUST LIKE THIS THING IN WARHAMMER"

[2022-12-26 17:21:36] <!%AirahsELL> people grossly overestimate the cost of warhammer. unless you build like 5 armies, it's cheaper than other tabletop minis games to get into, even with painting.

[2022-12-26 21:21:34] <+machacha_fulgrim> i honestly think the ppl who dont think alot are happy because they dont worry about the future, its true

[2022-12-26 21:22:17] <redmanticore> oh, they will.
[2022-12-26 21:22:22] <Seamoni> You can be both smart and happy, but it takes time.  It is about understanding what you have control over and doing something about it and avoid worriying about the rest where you can.

[2022-12-26 21:23:19] <@%BlackCharcz> Good thing about overthinking though - if you find a great idea, you just zoom forward with the BEST plan how to do it and it's 1000% better than if you don't plan it
