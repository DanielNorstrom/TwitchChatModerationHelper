[2023-01-05 16:30:42] <+klone_iron_fist> if you had a tournament and let's say team A won that turney, and then they got to enter another tournament across town right to the final. Super scummy, i agree with you. But if I'm hostign the tourney, from a money stand point, I'm not too bothered by it.

[2023-01-05 16:31:14] <+klone_iron_fist> I think they should allow reroll go again, ON A FRESH account
[2023-01-05 16:31:39] <+klone_iron_fist> But it's such a compelling storyline in a race
[2023-01-05 16:31:59] <SollSmottoh> I think the "restarting and winning again is bad for other people" is the wrong argument to use (even through it's obviously true) I think the "restarting and winning again" is bad for the person winning again. Because it limits the amounts of competitors it makes the race less exciting and therefore less interesting to sponsors. And that leads to smaller prizes, therefore bad for the winners
[2023-01-05 16:31:59] <+klone_iron_fist> Nugi started wtich 4 days later and came back to win!

[2023-01-05 16:43:41] <+klone_iron_fist> I agree, the carry over of gear is too much. Like the Delve race with the Ignite unique, you could literally play it on ANY ascendancy
[2023-01-05 16:43:42] <GrandCleric> when you dont reset you juet make usain bolt run 200 m run starting from 100m already in if I get it right right nugi ?

[2023-01-05 16:44:49] <+klone_iron_fist> @GrandCleric not exactly since the people running the 100 were running while he was doing the 200

[2023-01-05 16:45:21] <+klone_iron_fist> You probably lost about 15 hours in levelling and the tiem you spent winningthe first race.
[2023-01-05 16:45:23] <MFEpicOne> yeah but you had to run a full 100% race first

[2023-01-05 16:45:57] <rittlezzz> the reward for running the full 100% race is u win.. not that u get to just win 2x
[2023-01-05 16:45:57] <GrandCleric> @klone_iron_fist I see
[2023-01-05 16:46:19] <Ventrua> I think 1 placement per account or non-class gauntlet work well, I dont like banning rerolling in general
[2023-01-05 16:46:19] <+CorruptPharaoh> Hi Nugi :D
[2023-01-05 16:46:21] <Karvarousku> I mean it is an even playing field because others could do exactly what the winner did (or better yet prepare the actual run instead of racing the 1st time around) but that's just shit and would be so bad. But ppl do that
[2023-01-05 16:46:30] <!%+Myth82> NOTED
[2023-01-05 16:46:34] <%Lazzius> pepoG
[2023-01-05 16:46:35] <Karvarousku> ppl farm gear/progress on better char to then switch to the real character
[2023-01-05 16:46:48] <MFEpicOne> if you can't get 5th by the time another guy got first and 5th, that's a you problem
[2023-01-05 16:46:50] <FiveKYU> pepoG
[2023-01-05 16:47:02] <Ventrua> @MFEpicOne that doesnt work in gauntlet

[2023-01-05 16:47:13] VIEWERS: 596
[2023-01-05 16:47:17] <Synthetic37> The core of the argument is that classes are NOT 100% balanced so rerolling from best ascendancy to 5th best and winning there aswell gives you an unfair advantage
[2023-01-05 16:47:37] <Ventrua> what you are saying would apply to a sc race @MFEpicOne
[2023-01-05 16:47:39] <Synthetic37> This is nugis core argument
[2023-01-05 16:47:44] <Karvarousku> @Synthetic37 Yeah and the counter is "you could farm with the better char to prepare the actual run" (but I agree its just dumb)
[2023-01-05 16:47:52] <Karvarousku> not the argument itself, but the result
[2023-01-05 16:48:05] <Synthetic37> @Synthetic37 i mean yeah thats why nugi says you should have to stick to your class
[2023-01-05 16:48:20] <MFEpicOne> that's still on the other players for being worse
[2023-01-05 16:48:27] <Karvarousku> but that causes big problems that already got mentioned earlier @Synthetic37
[2023-01-05 16:48:33] <Synthetic37> does it?

[2023-01-05 16:52:51] <Karvarousku> I mean the fact its a class race makes it not as competitive, but it's just better format to split it. I think just allowing 1 account / win on the asc ladder is the way to go

[2023-01-05 16:56:10] <Synthetic37> the issue with trying to split up gaunlet / making it class specific etc, is you get the viewership by making it a big even where everything happens at the same time so you couldnt really implement the suggested changes there imo

[2023-01-05 16:58:47] <blacklusterseph> from a viewer perspective i definitely lose interest once the re-rolling starts. people muling cracked gear for the same busted build between characters isn't very compelling
[2023-01-05 16:58:47] <Ventrua> there is one counteragrument in terms of viewership, more ppl will want to watch a race of ben vs nick even on reroll than me vs @Karvarousku on our first characters

[2023-01-05 17:00:00] <BlueBanana3> tournament organizers could just say that the best players are to be found. not the best characters owners. one player cannot be the best and the second best at the same time

[2023-01-05 17:00:05] <Karvarousku> Aight here's the solution we have 7 gauntlets events, 1 for each class
[2023-01-05 17:00:10] <Penguinizer> Yeah one prize per account is fine imo. If you start an entirely new fresh account after getting first and then still beat out people that were catching up to your first place account you probably deserve it.

[2023-01-05 17:05:08] <+klone_iron_fist> I agree we don't watch for one person, but do LESS people watch if one person wins 3 of the races.
[2023-01-05 17:05:08] <MFEpicOne> my point is that the top guy gets the viewers and ben just happens to be that guy right now

[2023-01-05 17:13:55] <Bobbydomino> Solution would be to add challenges where seismic isn't good, but it's good at everything

[2023-01-05 17:14:31] <k_logz> It's gonna be BONEZONE DESTROYING EVERYTHING, not even close, bonzeone shattering the gauntlet into pieces, lets go login dude

[2023-01-05 17:38:58] <Penguinizer> Raid races really need some time rules because holy shit it gets unhealthy when you have teams pushing 18-24 hours, sleeping 4-6 hours and doing another 18.

[2023-01-05 17:39:14] <iliasna> @ryuukk__ its not in the same way as league or dota or csgo, its dumb to apply poe to the same set of rules

[2023-01-05 17:46:48] <+bluebooger> @Myth82 but the season doesn't start on day one -- so the head start you get is 3 days of experimentation and learning the areas -- which everyone else can do on launch

[2023-01-05 18:07:33] <+ImAToughCookie> tweaking is just not enough to flatten the learning curve. Poe is extremely depth depended. new players have no chance

[2023-01-05 18:12:33] <%+Kennard_> the new style pr communcation sucks. e.g saying that defense don't get nerfed and than silently adding new mapmods to counter defense

[2023-01-05 18:12:58] <GoGoLoThirty> @Kennard_ well isnt that partly because the game is hugely complex and the team is massive now too? I thought that was just internal comms breaking down
[2023-01-05 18:13:05] <GoGoLoThirty> maybe thats mega copium
[2023-01-05 18:13:06] <DrDexxer> @Kennard_ u raun your maps not white LUL ?

[2023-01-05 18:13:09] <ryuukk__> @DrDexxer genshin is not bad, it's actually a game, if you want to look at a trash game with a trash monetization scheme, look at Diablo Immortal
[2023-01-05 18:13:17] <b0obznsriracha> i mean poe is still a banger

[2023-01-05 18:21:13] <Foortsatak> the poison version is kinda lacking imo
[2023-01-05 18:21:21] <RareTheFrog> poison is a nice thing to work to but till then fire does just fine
[2023-01-05 18:21:35] <Foortsatak> yea
[2023-01-05 18:21:47] <TheLaranjo> You need a Covenant and a United in Dream and you're good to go

[2023-01-05 18:22:35] <+DutyMarv> lacking for ubers maybe, but for everything else its easy
[2023-01-05 18:22:51] <TheLaranjo> You still deal a lot of hit damage with Poison SRS, so you really don't need anything but the weapon and chest to start

[2023-01-05 19:05:19] <!%+bananeeFTW> poison is soooo strong because of the 3 uniques for SRS! hit version is also very very strong
