[2022-12-26 17:52:26] <clapbomber> @realcasc that's what I'm saying, and there's largely no consequences. I feel like hockey now is all about trying to spot who has "it" the earliest, and then they proceed to fuck those kids up. Not everybody is going to make it. Look at the poor kid who played for London Knights who just committed suicide.

[2022-12-26 20:12:05] <JGx2> gotta take all of the elements to the bomb site to set the nuke. everybody on map can see you have the elements too lol
[2022-12-26 20:12:07] <%uhhhBedninja> Not in warzone @iced_96

[2022-12-26 20:12:58] <%+arctimon> @JayDogBigDog Holding the second nuke element makes you take damage
[2022-12-26 20:13:10] <@%kush06> Because he has an element that causes damage @zmotahs
[2022-12-26 20:13:14] <JoNasty87> @zmotahs Because he has 2 elements on him

[2022-12-26 21:33:49] <@^Streamlabs> TeeP enjoys the core gameplay of WZ 2.0. Loves the look and feel of the map. TeeP prefers free loadout to be during 1st circle and more money economy on the map. Hitching/Lagging is an issue as well. TeeP loves the game so far and looks forward to quality of life improvements. TeeP does not know what the exact meta will be for the game, but the meta will probably evolve quickly as it did for WZ 1. TeeP will be using a variety of loadouts. - !guns for more info
