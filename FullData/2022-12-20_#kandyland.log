[2022-12-20 14:52:56] <triptychia> Wh so anggry?
[2022-12-20 14:52:56] <rgdraidy> I mean, Coca-Cola had cocaine in their drinks without anyone dying
[2022-12-20 14:53:01] <theofficialjoel> ok I'm way to young to be hearing about this
[2022-12-20 14:53:14] <theofficialjoel> goodbye
[2022-12-20 14:53:16] <wulfgang71> they used to sell heroin and cocaine over the counter safely
[2022-12-20 14:53:18] <+llRoGzPhxll_Blaze> Also people who say that have a misconception, they don't realize drugs effects when your young doesn't do much, but when you get older it's like paying back a loan and your body taxes you.
[2022-12-20 14:53:24] <makelzi> i vote for you for president !
[2022-12-20 14:53:41] <rusty_recluse> so alcahole is strait posio
[2022-12-20 14:53:47] <wulfgang71> they actually developed heroin to ween people off of morphine
[2022-12-20 14:53:47] <UncannyMan> but it cut in on Big Pharma profits, so they outlawed it
[2022-12-20 14:53:56] <wulfgang71> history is crazy
[2022-12-20 14:53:59] <+llRoGzPhxll_Blaze> LUL actually true.
[2022-12-20 14:53:59] <mzay> "safely"
[2022-12-20 14:54:00] <inzhah> The government taxed weed 33% when they made it legal
[2022-12-20 14:54:04] <+llRoGzPhxll_Blaze> Coca-cola actually used to have cocaine on it
[2022-12-20 14:54:25] <triptychia> not really. I lode my virginira to here I as 1 she be 15, what ever in 1990s. what is the the points?
[2022-12-20 14:54:26] <t1deadlyy> what did you try?
[2022-12-20 14:54:27] <theofficialjoel> just saying there's gotta be an age warning
[2022-12-20 14:54:29] <wulfgang71> we used to do so many wild things in the 30s, 40s, 50s, 60s
[2022-12-20 14:54:32] <+llRoGzPhxll_Blaze> The only time heroine is "safe" is when someone is about to die.

[2022-12-20 15:11:57] <Moyalopez> youth is the best re-production time. Around 18-25 on both males and females. However, females and males are not mature enough to handle kids at that young age in a modernized society. People need to go through hardship and harsh responsibility to mature enough by the age of 25
[2022-12-20 15:12:01] <kebbac3p0> Yh that’s mad

[2022-12-20 15:52:36] <%+ohlawdy1> Draenor had the potential to be the best expansion because the lore behind it is so good but they absolutely butchered it.

[2022-12-20 16:04:28] <Laukkak> Hej @Kandyland hörde att du var gravid, jag o min sambo ska bli föräldrar, har för mig att det blir ungefär lika datum. Vi ska få en lite flicka hoppas du mår bra o att bebisen inte sprakar så mycket på din kissblossa. Men vi ville kolla vad du får om du har kollat det, mutch love <3 du behöver inte svara om du inte vill prata om det <3
[2022-12-20 16:04:38] <mrKhreavelt> but if u dont give a fck then u can make mistakes
[2022-12-20 16:04:45] <mrKhreavelt> and mistakes lead to problems
[2022-12-20 16:04:50] <mrKhreavelt> and problems lead tot hinking

[2022-12-20 18:25:44] <%fugde> I got a great idea for 600 sub goal: try the guy who will read you chat for a full stream- it might be annoying buy boy is it content
[2022-12-20 18:25:53] <%Neverloss> Elon Musk is the homie, so much going on
[2022-12-20 18:25:59] <%BlueT1tan> hopefuly i won't be mad because of a coworker tomorrow monkaLaugh
[2022-12-20 18:26:03] <%SAXEL34> I will be up. I hope...
[2022-12-20 18:26:08] <+llRoGzPhxll_Blaze> I like Elon for a lot of stuff except the 5g neurolink, that's ridiculous
[2022-12-20 18:26:10] <%Neverloss> If I dont see you, merry x-mas etc.
[2022-12-20 18:26:13] <+llRoGzPhxll_Blaze> I dont want shit downloaded into my brain.
[2022-12-20 18:26:24] <mo0ns> BOOBA
[2022-12-20 18:26:36] <+llRoGzPhxll_Blaze> Especially since everything and anything can be hacked nowadays.
[2022-12-20 18:26:51] <%fugde> There is no way he could have
[2022-12-20 18:26:57] <+bseeeeeel> well he cares about streamers I guess
[2022-12-20 18:27:03] <+bseeeeeel> you should make that guy an admin
[2022-12-20 18:27:08] <%BlueT1tan> bots can barely keep up PepeLmao
[2022-12-20 18:27:09] <ChampValentine> With my luck, if I got the neurolink it would be hacked
[2022-12-20 18:27:15] <%fugde> worst thing was that he was actually serious about it LUL
[2022-12-20 18:27:15] <+bseeeeeel> bots are stupid
[2022-12-20 18:27:22] <%+DonkyZz_13> Have du been watering the blommor på lately? FeelsAmazingMan
[2022-12-20 18:27:27] <+llRoGzPhxll_Blaze> If anything they removed the chip from my brain the date of the accident lmao

[2022-12-20 18:27:51] <%fugde> What is the neurolink supposed to do?
[2022-12-20 18:27:58] <%fugde> since everybody seems to know wtf is going on but me
[2022-12-20 18:28:00] <+llRoGzPhxll_Blaze> Connect you to the cloud, and world wide sattelites.
[2022-12-20 18:28:07] <+llRoGzPhxll_Blaze> also make you sync up with computers around the world.

[2022-12-20 18:28:31] <+llRoGzPhxll_Blaze> Thats the IDEAL situation.
[2022-12-20 18:28:45] <%BlueT1tan> @fugde the final result will be to have a phone in your head
[2022-12-20 18:28:50] <+llRoGzPhxll_Blaze> however people's nature is always selfish.
[2022-12-20 18:28:53] <%fugde> Oh i'mma get me some, time to learn Chinese madafakkasssssssss

[2022-12-20 18:29:10] <+llRoGzPhxll_Blaze> Especially if they have too much power, like being able to push the button on a nuke.
