Today I posit a question: what's better than bad? It's good! Yes, Green/Red Goodcard storm will lead us into quite adequate results thanks to the inclusion of our most gracious god Kloth...wait, there's no Klothys in this list? Oof. Well, good luck us I guess.

[2022-12-29 16:09:42] <@FourDogsInAHorseSuit> This week, spike tries as many decks as nessessary to get Brech banned. Unfortunately: Anyone who'd notice is off for the year.

[2022-12-29 16:27:08] <%StrangerColin> maybe this has been mentioned already but the new light is sweet but is making the video weird and wavy

[2022-12-29 16:28:22] <+Prescience6631> This deck also highlights how ridiculous ragavan is…monkey has virtually no synergy with anything else we are doing, but 1 mana planeswalker is good

[2022-12-29 16:28:24] <FrothyOmen> yeah it's a weird rolling shutter effect with spike's webcam.  Needs a better camera to hopefully avoid that artifact.
[2022-12-29 16:28:25] <+w0llsm0th> 2nd the waviness light comment. The intensity turned down definitely helped
[2022-12-29 16:28:31] <+LeSnapcasteur> the jeskai list that won the super qualifier is probably strictly better than this with iteration, teferi ending and wear tear

[2022-12-29 16:40:53] <@%^MTGBot> Dear MTGO User AspiringSpike: I noticed your decklist does not contain the Magic: the Gathering card Thrasta, Tempest's Roar. To me, this is a grievous oversight that must be immediately rectified. Please add this card to your deck forthwith or I will be left with no recourse but to unfollow. Again, the card I am suggesting you add is Thrasta, Tempest's Roar. Thank You.

[2022-12-29 18:13:53] <Gincola> bruh, breach in burn
[2022-12-29 18:13:57] <@FourDogsInAHorseSuit> According to my excel the fifteenth card provides a estimated 3.4 percent increase in winpercentages and the companion provides 6.9 percent. However, the odds fall to 4.2 and 4.8, respectively, when those cards are green. When they're blue we see the opposite. Combined with the 68.7% win percentage on the play, and 45% on the draw, therefore it becomes correct to play a package of both Gravecrawler and Shambling ghast over Bloodghast and Progenitius. Thoughts?
[2022-12-29 18:13:59] <%$Ocara115> For the burn players saying Lurrus meant you were losing; yes, and then the Lurrus would help pull you ahead again. That was what Lurrus was good at doing in burn
[2022-12-29 18:14:05] <anotherpangolin> also if you didn't have lurrus you were 100% losing instead of just probably losing in those situations

[2022-12-29 18:15:17] <disco_shark> turns out sometimes winning games you were probably going to lose is better than the 15th sideboard card which you bring in in like 15% of your games and hardly ever draw
[2022-12-29 18:15:31] <%+generalmongoose> normally if you go one on one with another deck, you got a 50/50 chance of winning. But I'm a genetic freak and I'm not normal! So you got a 25%, AT BEST, at beat me. Then you add Lurrus to the mix, your chances of winning drastic go down.

[2022-12-29 18:53:49] <singto12> considered not to play that much lands in ur deck spike?

[2022-12-29 18:54:06] <thetmeat8> how many land in the deck?

[2022-12-29 18:54:15] <matthewshaman> you should make a poll on hardest modern decks to play I agree
[2022-12-29 18:54:19] <%Goody_Phil> how about casting ragavan just because

[2022-12-29 18:56:20] <%Goody_Phil> companion is a good mechanic
[2022-12-29 18:56:21] <matthewshaman> such a weird line
[2022-12-29 18:56:22] <mtg_cribbs> But why companions? Kappa
[2022-12-29 18:56:32] <%$Ocara115> But why male models?
[2022-12-29 18:56:35] <%ElDeadMann> jegantha is short for giant gantha
[2022-12-29 18:56:35] <$Werebere> their Jegantha is mopey cause it ain't borderless
[2022-12-29 18:56:36] <thetmeat8> 2 mana kill the 5/5 seems ok
[2022-12-29 18:56:47] <Morderent> Grape shot control
[2022-12-29 18:56:50] <Poco_the_turtle> if either player didn't have jegantha the game would just be over right?

[2022-12-29 18:57:51] <IAmTheSamsquanch> Just good deckbuilding.. Kappa
[2022-12-29 18:57:55] <%loveandmushrooms> when they play jegantha you know they don't have fury
[2022-12-29 18:58:01] <+mangork> Eventually as the card pool grows all companions become free in some deck, and pitch spells existing means they always have value
[2022-12-29 18:58:18] <%Goody_Phil> exactsies
[2022-12-29 18:58:19] <EscargoExpress> I still find it amazing how badly they missed on the original companion rules. It's more balanced with the pay 3 to move it to hand rules, but the fact that the convo still happens today highlights how big a miss the original rules were, IMO.
[2022-12-29 18:58:20] <LammBear> I miss Lurrus :/
[2022-12-29 18:58:20] <+this_loser22> I feell ike the ban companions debate would come to an end if they banned companions
[2022-12-29 18:58:21] <@FourDogsInAHorseSuit> Yeah, you WOULD hear less of this if they were unplayable. it's almost like any playable companion is inheritly broken and there's no middle ground.
[2022-12-29 18:58:28] <%$Ocara115> Tbh even Kaheera is actually played in elemental decks. Jegantha just shows up to a club they werent invited to
[2022-12-29 18:58:28] <%opda2056> Yorion and Lurrus were also basically free, and started that kind of discourse
[2022-12-29 18:58:37] <%loveandmushrooms> @mangork yeah but jegantha can't be in decks with most pitching cards
[2022-12-29 18:58:39] <dougie_doug391> Hot take: unban everything
[2022-12-29 18:58:43] <ierfrolh> we need more gyruda chads in modern

[2022-12-29 18:58:48] <+BallSoHardTV> It could definitely be true for Zirda, not Lutri or Umori though

[2022-12-29 18:58:55] <philip619> what about obosh?
[2022-12-29 18:58:57] <matthewshaman> the problem with keruga is that every 3 drop or more isnt as good as casting rhinos
[2022-12-29 18:58:58] <Sugar_Bandit> @aspiringspike the gifts storm discord refuses to play jegantha, both pre and post nerf

[2022-12-29 19:01:41] <%+slycroissant> I would love to see a companion that says you deck has to be 20 cards less. Like an anti-Yorion Kappa
[2022-12-29 19:01:42] <EscargoExpress> Ban basic lands - they're so OP they're run in well over 90% of meta decks!
[2022-12-29 19:01:46] <IAmTheSamsquanch> Unban Pod, we have Force of Vigor/Negation and Saga to fined Pithing Needle
[2022-12-29 19:01:48] <+NotSatanIPromise> ban basic island
[2022-12-29 19:01:48] <Sugar_Bandit> If your hot take includes words that have been spoken before it’s not a hot take 👏
[2022-12-29 19:01:49] <enragedlobster1> Lurrus should've been templated like Keruga, not the other way around
[2022-12-29 19:01:50] <Poco_the_turtle> control with Keruga instead of kaheera
[2022-12-29 19:01:50] <nick__sama> isnt that all fetchlands
[2022-12-29 19:01:52] <%opda2056> If Keruga was Permanents over like 5 or 6, then it'd be a lot more interesting, especially with the design space of current planeswalkers at 3/4
[2022-12-29 19:02:04] <%servy215> They should just print some companions in every set, just like plainswalkers, and make having a companion more or less required for every competitive deck.  When everyone's got a broken card, no one has a broken card.
[2022-12-29 19:02:15] <%+seeker509> Ok so the more I think about it... the more i like divide by 0 no cap

[2022-12-29 19:05:28] <%+red_kreppelin> does expressive iteration count as a grindy 3 drop?
[2022-12-29 19:05:41] <%d0gula> @red_kreppelin it is often plaeyd on turn 3
[2022-12-29 19:05:43] <FearSide5> no

[2022-12-29 19:05:57] <%$Ocara115> Days Spike's chat has gone without asking to ban or unban something in modern: 0
[2022-12-29 19:06:03] <%opda2056> I honestly wonder if Birthing pod would even be an issue now. There is *So* much more flexible removal, and the cards it wants to flip into for combo pieces are 4/5 costs

[2022-12-29 19:06:35] <%opda2056> Yeah, that's true it would be awesome in Yawg
[2022-12-29 19:06:37] <MordeToLight> @opda2056 its a bit of a problem you can combo from a dork
[2022-12-29 19:06:41] <+Sorgath_> Oh no, you played birthing pod, shame i have 2 copies of leyline binding in my hand
[2022-12-29 19:06:44] <MordeToLight> t1 dork, t2 pod, t3 win
[2022-12-29 19:06:49] <%$Ocara115> Pod has the slightest chance of being an issue in Yawg, so I say it's perfectly fine to unban
[2022-12-29 19:06:49] <IAmTheSamsquanch> @opda2056 I think it's fine, one of the things they said when they banned it was 'its hard for blue decks to interact on the draw,' but we have force of Negation now

[2022-12-29 19:09:45] <%opda2056> Although, if linear and disruptable combos on turn 2 that required playing a bunch of cards you never want to draw were an issue in modern, then a lot more decks would have parts banned

[2022-12-29 19:25:32] <%$Ocara115> DRC would be the best card in the set if it werent for Ragavan

[2022-12-29 19:25:35] <@%+TurtlePowerMTG> DRC + Bauble = Twin
[2022-12-29 19:25:40] <tomyang17> i think if ragavan draws a card instead of stealing a card, it would feel much better
[2022-12-29 19:25:40] <%d0gula> lmao it feels fair losing to tron
[2022-12-29 19:25:41] <+Carrionlich> you dont play painter LOL i quit legacy till they banned it after monkey killed me with my own grindston
[2022-12-29 19:25:41] <@FourDogsInAHorseSuit> Channeller is the stronger of the two, when my op never draws a bad card again the rest of the game and I brick it feels just as bad as rags
[2022-12-29 19:25:52] <tomyang17> stealing in general is just a feels bad moment
[2022-12-29 19:25:55] <@%Dragonlord_Freya> People would probably be calling for it's ban if it weren't for ragavan being way more expensive and feel bads

[2022-12-29 19:34:56] <nick__sama> it has little to do with how easy it is to flip. it's the context of the game plan that u tempo decks in legacy get to enact that isn't possible in modern

[2022-12-29 19:40:38] <+Padreterno87> Its not because of this deck, but I feel breach is a little bit too messed up
[2022-12-29 19:40:40] <%+nicol_b> spike your opponent cast broken mh2 card ragavan and yet you've won the game? Can you explain how that happened?

[2022-12-29 19:41:00] <@%^MTGBot> The League Match has started! aspiringspike (2-1) is currently playing Popeville (1-0).
[2022-12-29 19:41:05] <@%phuckingmagikal> @nicol_b It's because Spike's ragavan's counter the opponent's ragavans
[2022-12-29 19:41:09] <@The_Last_God_> @aspiringspike just had a guy from my lgs message me asking for harvest and anarchomancers for tomorrow, i blame you for this

[2022-12-29 19:41:48] <%+red_kreppelin> if abundant harvest was blue it'd probably be the best cantrip in the format

[2022-12-29 21:13:30] <tenorless420> thats true @achesst
[2022-12-29 21:13:32] <Parole_MTG> I know bolt is stronger, but what do you think of playing some lava darts as well? The synergy with breach and DRC isn't bad and i feel like it fixes a bit the issue of not enought cards in the yard.

[2022-12-29 21:15:34] <TheVGLand> But why is it bad that a 0 mana card that slow draws a card bad for the format? It makes many cards that wouldn't be as good playable (Shredder and Iconoclast are fine, but much better in the format because of Bauble). Modern should have innocuous, but powerful cards.
[2022-12-29 21:15:36] <%iceman012> Unban top

[2022-12-29 21:19:27] <%+scurtis9> in hindsight is it maybe better to not cast the bauble last turn. That way you leave the rits in the yard

[2022-12-29 21:23:15] <%+IzexD> It's kinda like Opal used to be like a format staple until it became a real issue Bauble is about there

[2022-12-29 21:24:33] <%+reginaldbaldinger> Hot take: ragavan should have been a companion
[2022-12-29 21:24:40] <+jimbob_jimbob> @Nadu6 ban dockside and thoracle
[2022-12-29 21:24:41] <20_eyess> Opal is more powerful but goes in less decks

[2022-12-29 21:24:46] <TheVGLand> I think we should just unban Gitaxian Probe, format needs a good shakeup.

[2022-12-29 21:25:15] <Parole_MTG> @myoringaming I have a theory: if you bring in necromancia and you don't know what to name, you probably shouldn't bring it in this match up.
[2022-12-29 21:25:21] <+Castor_Fields> primordial could not be unbanned lol

[2022-12-29 21:25:49] <Parkschaden> why, you are just getting two cards with gifts in edh
[2022-12-29 21:25:49] <%+swinda_> Iirc there are several gifts piles that just win no matter what
[2022-12-29 21:25:50] <%Bambino430> EDH should require a minimum number of removal or counters since some people just don't have interaction in their decks....

[2022-12-29 21:26:07] <pandasloth70> people rarely talk about how formats are built around powerful cards and those cards are banned around and that is ok if the gameplay is good
[2022-12-29 21:26:08] <+jimbob_jimbob> also if gifts ungiven resolves in a competetive commadner game the player who cast it is winning
[2022-12-29 21:26:08] <+ClarkCLK> @Bambino430 thats the dumbest thing someone could have said
[2022-12-29 21:26:16] <larrylegend420> The problem with Gifts Ungiven is you get to pick which 'opponent" chooses the cards you keep.
[2022-12-29 21:26:23] <+Castor_Fields> @swinda_ there are and its the same with intuition, but intuition is expensive monetarily so it isn't banned
[2022-12-29 21:26:44] <+jimbob_jimbob> if they are gonna ban anything it should be dockside and thoracle for sure

[2022-12-29 21:27:09] <r3dmandoto> @ImRando Or the gorillion rampant growth effects in every green deck
[2022-12-29 21:27:12] <Parole_MTG> Yeah @myoringaming i see the idea. I guess it depends on the deck, currently asmo does nothing without cookbook (except maybe a goose or something), but is a 3/3 hard to cast, while book fuels sagas. So it depends on what you're afraid of.

[2022-12-29 21:28:40] <pandasloth70> as in an example modern bans around fetchlands existing because of the wide color combinations it enables and that is ok because people like that gameplay.
