[2023-01-02 09:33:04] <%Lonefellow> If there's one thing I like here compared to the Sphere grid it's that you don't have to return to the places you haven't activated the nodes to be able to reach them

[2023-01-02 09:34:59] <%Lonefellow> Let's say you skip nodes in the Sphere grid for whatever reason (or go the other way if there's a different path) - you have to then go back or use a teleport sphere to be able to reach the nodes
[2023-01-02 09:36:02] <%Lonefellow> Ah, never mind. It's too early for me too, I can't English this early LUL

[2023-01-02 09:53:35] <MultiSayto> Hi Seven. I'm fine. Liteally just woke up 10 minutes ago. Just had my first cup of coffee. BTW FF Xiii looks fun to play. Thinking of getting the game myself.
[2023-01-02 09:54:16] VIEWERS: 212
[2023-01-02 09:54:37] <%Lonefellow> It is, mostly because the game prevents overgrinding
[2023-01-02 09:55:20] <%TidusZecht> you dont even have SeeD pay
[2023-01-02 09:56:09] <chavadlc> I like the gameplay of this game, i just don’t like most of the characters and i feel the story is a mess or too complicated for me maybe. Never cared of what was going on in the end

[2023-01-02 09:57:56] <@%+Mike410459> The most confusing with this game is the terms, there are alot and the important SL ones sound the same.

[2023-01-02 09:59:26] <chavadlc> Also i just liked lightning and Sazh, there other characters where so badly developed imo, probably one of the worst main characters in a FF to me

[2023-01-02 10:54:48] <%+Smashtro> not debuffing is where I went wrong first time I played this because the FF games I had played before it was not usually worth trying to debuff
[2023-01-02 10:54:49] <@%+Mike410459> I need to get another PS3 eventually so I can play this again. The disc reader on my last one died and I just never replaced it and I ended up getting a PS4 instead.

[2023-01-02 10:59:23] <%+spectr0nn> @Mike410459 might be worth waiting for a PS4 release of the game. Square has recently stated that they want all their content to be available on modern digital platforms
[2023-01-02 10:59:31] <%+spectr0nn> so im assuming that includes FF13

[2023-01-02 11:01:05] <%+spectr0nn> @Smashtro yeah i actually liked the focus on debuffing a lot, because thats not something you commonly see in FF games and its a cool tactical approach to battles
[2023-01-02 11:01:43] <%Neobullseye> FF5 is the one exception I can think of.
[2023-01-02 11:01:59] <%+spectr0nn> yeah thats the problem usually
[2023-01-02 11:02:03] <%Neobullseye> Status effects can completely cripple bosses in that game.

[2023-01-02 11:02:52] <%+spectr0nn> debuffing in FF8 wasnt too bad to do either, because you can junction it to your physicals. i remember blind being a popular one for example

[2023-01-02 13:32:32] <%Neobullseye> Like I said before: The reason you finally gain some freedom now is because you escaped the Cocoon Fal'cie's 'sphere of influence'.
[2023-01-02 13:32:38] <%Neobullseye> Quite literally, in fact :P
[2023-01-02 13:32:44] <@%Eymas> exactly
[2023-01-02 13:32:48] <%+JaymieGamer> so ur only using the main 3 for each?
[2023-01-02 13:32:50] <%Retaliator_NL> Will you also be playing the other 13 games? E.g. Lightning returns?
[2023-01-02 13:33:00] <%+trestin3> isn't he pretty good with sab too? or am I remembering that wrong?
[2023-01-02 13:33:01] <%+spectr0nn> nope
[2023-01-02 13:33:03] <%$FFyte> no, Retaliator_NL
[2023-01-02 13:33:05] <%Retaliator_NL> Also why is it, that probably the most controversial ff game gets the most sequals
[2023-01-02 13:33:09] <%$FFyte> next game is FFXV
[2023-01-02 13:33:25] <%+spectr0nn> @Retaliator_NL it was really popular in Japan apparently
[2023-01-02 13:33:32] <skulgun> when are we getting FF viii-2

[2023-01-02 13:34:21] <%Felknia_> I remember grinding the hell out of that battle
[2023-01-02 13:34:25] <%+spectr0nn> also they invested a good bit in the engine tech for this game and i guess they wanted to get some more mileage out of it, hence more games

[2023-01-02 13:35:23] <%+JaymieGamer> so 15 is easy to do with out accessories unless u play on normal mode, if they released all 7 dlc hard mode would have been added lol
[2023-01-02 13:35:36] <%+trestin3> yeah and with growth egg it is Insane

[2023-01-02 13:38:52] <%TidusZecht> okay yeah I was remembering it correctly. it requires hope to be equipped with 4 kaiser knuckles and his simurgh but it makes him immune to physical damage. however the cure spell ceases healing him and you have to use potions
[2023-01-02 13:38:53] <big4lil> a nice change coming off of 12
[2023-01-02 13:39:13] <%+trestin3> its too bad that there isn't a Gil grind in this too, but that would be unbalanced probably

[2023-01-02 14:14:00] <%+Gremloch> is FFXIII even considered a port?  Isn't XBOX basically Windows?

[2023-01-02 14:18:19] <%wellsjc> It's been great up until yesterday. It may have been because I played it a ton yesterday and it doesn't like super extended plays.
[2023-01-02 14:18:25] <%MetalGearXicor> I hated Star Ocean 4 on 360. If you wanted to grind for stuff you had to constantly switch between the 2nd and 3rd discs

[2023-01-02 15:46:52] <%Neobullseye> I'm pretty sure the game intends for you to do pretty much all the Cie'th Stone missions available to you at this point, and probably also fight everything that happens to be in the way. Which gets you a ton of resources along with CP.
[2023-01-02 15:47:13] <%Neobullseye> It's just that the Behemoth Grind is WAY faster.
[2023-01-02 15:48:33] VIEWERS: 657
[2023-01-02 15:49:27] <%Neobullseye> IIRC, the first Cie'th Stone mission on the Archylite Steppe (or however it's spelled) is right in front of you, and the last one that's available at that point in the game deposits you right next to the path leading to plot progress.

[2023-01-02 16:19:13] <%TwitchTemplar> And this is why I said the upgrade system is one of the worst thing in this game, even if the gear itself is fine. If it was something like using specific materials per piece it'd probably be more interesting
[2023-01-02 16:20:11] <lafrin_jim> @twitchtemplar I wasted so much items the first time I played and kinda ignored that afterward
[2023-01-02 16:20:15] <%zazu1019> shoulding +150 or so str just break the game absolutely?
[2023-01-02 16:20:18] <%TidusZecht> I was about to suggest it bggHaa

[2023-01-02 16:20:58] <%TwitchTemplar> It's a modern enough game that the devs could just assume ppl would look it up online so why bother doing it this way :/
[2023-01-02 16:21:24] <%zazu1019> That seems a bit insane
[2023-01-02 16:21:38] <%zazu1019> Sounds like Disgea system of OPing lol
[2023-01-02 16:21:39] <@SRGDUCK> Yeah a mini tutorial section that defines the XP bonus and item classes would have been ideal
[2023-01-02 16:22:06] <%KekkePeke> not only the trial and error part. the game itself is very stingy with gil unless you know specific things to farm
[2023-01-02 16:22:44] VIEWERS: 606
[2023-01-02 16:23:30] <%Aurien__> people say this is a modern game, but it came out 13 years ago which mean development started 18 years ago
[2023-01-02 16:24:02] <%TwitchTemplar> On the other hand I guess the game is balanced in a way you don't actually have to upgrade much if anything of your gear as long as your crystarium is far enough
[2023-01-02 16:24:45] VIEWERS: 606
[2023-01-02 16:24:53] <%+Vinitus> @TwitchTemplar def not unless you really know how to treat the enemys
[2023-01-02 16:25:04] <%Aurien__> and as far as 2004 Era SE goes, hand holding was definitely not a priority
