[2022-12-17 13:18:57] <%Pocketkos> 1 red portal takes only 1 person - but you start from the same point as if you just qued into a new dungeon, together, if you both took a red portal each.

[2022-12-17 15:09:57] <akubahtu> no matter u throw up or down
[2022-12-17 15:09:58] <vparkr> now it says 2705 times the diameter
[2022-12-17 15:10:02] <thedudeheit> the stick grenade does 131 dmg
[2022-12-17 15:10:09] <hangcool> yeah thats exactly the right way to put it..
[2022-12-17 15:10:19] <thedudeheit> and his leftclick does 70 and not 60
[2022-12-17 15:10:20] <+Namasaj_> @iddqd And you can stun rein shield Pog
[2022-12-17 15:10:21] <+medstudentgamez> ball would be useless

[2022-12-17 15:10:28] <+Reap_purr> i feel they should have just kept him as the only character with a solid stun

[2022-12-17 15:29:44] <%NinjaFaceTV> ;)
[2022-12-17 15:29:46] <%+Dearionza> the rail should bounce between enemies

[2022-12-17 15:29:52] <%Qnote> Not strong enough tbh
[2022-12-17 15:29:54] <%Pocketkos> her E should be global

[2022-12-17 15:29:56] <%+malbolsia626> reloads should insta kill a random enemy within 200 yards
[2022-12-17 15:29:58] <imteroble> Sounds lika nerf

[2022-12-17 15:30:02] <RandomCatOwner> Nah the rail disconnects players from the game
[2022-12-17 15:30:07] <%Qnote> Her snare should disable all movement and abilities
[2022-12-17 15:30:07] <sizz420> E also shoots lava out of the center
[2022-12-17 15:30:12] <%+malbolsia626> and her voice lines should stun anyone in line of sight
[2022-12-17 15:30:13] <chgentleman> her ultimate should just disconnect every enemy and give you an automatic win
