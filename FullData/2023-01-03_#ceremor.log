[2023-01-03 02:59:46] <@%^Nightbot> The legacy gunplay mod replicates the weapon mechanics that DayZ used prior to the new player controller. Heavier weapons have more inertia when swinging to aim. Hipfire is no longer a laser beam when firing full auto. ADSing is slightly slower. Recoil is more impactful.

[2023-01-03 03:05:02] <+somerandomdude444> IRL that stock would fold

[2023-01-03 03:06:29] <JValentineTV> @Ceremor  If you like this server, and it is what I think it is, contact the admins and they'll hook you up with priority que and anti snipe stuff. <3
[2023-01-03 03:06:32] <%TunnelSnakes_RuIe> it would matter if you were talking about no stock vs a stock but the difference between stocks is negligible in practice
[2023-01-03 03:06:43] <etherb20> Was that an explosive round?
[2023-01-03 03:06:43] <%TheGobblerr> guns are one thing i wish dayz followed suit with tarkov on

[2023-01-03 03:06:53] <+Digitalv0id> this looks like the super crazy hard mod
[2023-01-03 03:07:00] <03matrix> yea legacy gunplay should be a thing on every server imo makes the game so much more immersive

[2023-01-03 03:07:40] <%TunnelSnakes_RuIe> do guns ever spawn without stocks/handguards in vanilla
[2023-01-03 03:07:48] <+vprohealies> Depends on the legacy mod imo most of them go WAY over the top with sway and recoil

[2023-01-03 03:25:36] <%zargki> i think you had amox in the backpack
[2023-01-03 03:25:38] <etherb20> white walling is where you ads and lean and stick your head through walls while you moving along them. It lets people look through walls and sometimes de—renders all buildings and trees. It’s such a broken ass exploit @ceremor
[2023-01-03 03:25:40] <%JValentineTV> @Cretin138 Yes and no. If you use hemostatic medicine, your blood will not. Otherwise, yes
[2023-01-03 03:26:02] <%TheGobblerr> have you been playing much of the new Takov wipe? @Ceremor ?
[2023-01-03 03:26:02] <+Genzmoe> @etherb20 there are walls where you dont even need to do that

[2023-01-03 04:40:59] <@%^Nightbot> Lol. I don't really care if it's not a good look. I don't really like ceremor. Or this community. Just trying to clarify that I called him a sellout because I thought he was playing on base servers for real after this "fucking hate basers" stance. Apparently the best approach is to shut up and not stand up for yourself. Sounds fucking toxic to me. Don't speak your mind. I should have observed before judging and calling him a sellout. He's still a fuck though and ya'll are toxic.

[2023-01-03 05:06:12] <newworldmoulder> i thought it seemed like food lasts longer. it also takes way longer to bleed out
[2023-01-03 05:06:17] <augusticey> what's with the sleeping icon and the icon to the left of it?
[2023-01-03 05:06:17] <%JValentineTV> It's 3X food burn

[2023-01-03 06:54:07] <%$karlpaul> morning
[2023-01-03 06:54:18] <undead2539> @zargki remember when he used to RP a tutorial robot?
[2023-01-03 06:54:29] <%zargki> it was the best
[2023-01-03 06:54:31] <undead2539> back when he killed basers
[2023-01-03 06:54:40] <@%+Chaosshield> you burn less food per second jogging... but it takes more seconds to get there. In vanilla it is more food efficient to sprint than it is to jog to get somewhere
[2023-01-03 06:54:47] <%zargki> the not washed dayz FeelsBadMan Kappa
[2023-01-03 06:54:51] <@%+Chaosshield> the only time you want to not sprint is when you are healing health and yellow food
[2023-01-03 06:54:53] <undead2539> Those were the days
[2023-01-03 06:54:58] <@%+Chaosshield> because that will let you heal longer
[2023-01-03 06:55:00] <%+estaktik> is it me or i been hearing a lot about this Fankie YT guy lately?
[2023-01-03 06:55:06] <%Nate_LapT> those bloody hands could be an issue come time to eat though Kappa

[2023-01-03 06:55:34] <BakedKipling> CoolStoryBob
[2023-01-03 06:55:56] <@%+Chaosshield> yes, searching zeds or punching them with no gloves bloodies hands

[2023-01-03 06:57:04] <+vprohealies> Would be more realistic if it was slower than Vanilla

[2023-01-03 06:57:32] <+kafadrian> one thing ive always loved about this game... if you dont have gloves, you cant eat or whatever if you have boody hands, but if you have gloves? no worries, blood on your gloves doesnt matter

[2023-01-03 07:06:26] <%+estaktik> it:s called preview...ur confusing her LUL
[2023-01-03 07:06:29] <warsimming187> are there vanilla nights on tyhis server?
[2023-01-03 07:06:30] <undead2539> damn all this sprinting gave us red apple
[2023-01-03 07:06:34] <CiggyFreudd> but not the numbers
[2023-01-03 07:06:39] <warsimming187> unlike others where ppl negate night with gamma cheats
[2023-01-03 07:06:59] <undead2539> ffs should have just jogged
[2023-01-03 07:07:09] <+jonrambo416> you gonna eat the bandage
[2023-01-03 07:07:20] <@%+Chaosshield> I wonder if the meta then is to have stamina reduction on heavies but damage on lights
[2023-01-03 07:07:21] <%+ObiFizzle> i hate the glow around the character
[2023-01-03 07:07:26] <CiggyFreudd> ^

[2023-01-03 07:08:03] VIEWERS: 964
[2023-01-03 07:08:07] <@%+Chaosshield> stamina reduction on heavies for the stunlock but damage on lights for the heavy hitting quick jabs
[2023-01-03 07:08:20] <Streatman> oh no, he is not going to be okay... who would have thought
[2023-01-03 07:08:23] <%+estaktik> this server have the water nerf for food regen
[2023-01-03 07:08:28] <%hopeful_comp> need a cannibal skill tree
[2023-01-03 07:08:44] <chrisaliss> and reduced food spawns I believe. Best bet is a greenhouse
[2023-01-03 07:08:45] <%zargki> lights are useless for pvp
[2023-01-03 07:08:47] <@%+Chaosshield> I'm thinking lights for dealing with zeds
[2023-01-03 07:08:53] <%zargki> so yeah heavys all the way
[2023-01-03 07:08:57] <warsimming187> server said it adjusted lighting like flashlights and torches, how so?
[2023-01-03 07:09:09] <kronikspace> look under trees there's apples under alot of them usually

[2023-01-03 10:37:36] <%ArmoredArtist> When I played I think I recall zombie cuts not needed to be bandaged. They heal on their own and barely bleed. Bandaging is more likely to cause an infection if everything is not disinfected
