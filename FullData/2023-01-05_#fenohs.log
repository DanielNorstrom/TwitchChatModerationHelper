[2023-01-05 16:40:10] <%gorny_prime> @FenoHS every time they nerf, it has unintended consequences which are usually worse

[2023-01-05 16:40:16] <%Rennman8> @FenoHS we need a nerf to concede that would make hearthstone great like Snap

[2023-01-05 16:40:33] <ambdoexious> should definitely nerf astalor

[2023-01-05 16:40:55] <!%J_Alexander_HS> Someone mentioned yesterday they think they’ve lost to the five armor from Astalor more often than the damage
[2023-01-05 16:41:11] <!%its_timelord> @Linkolini yeah i get your point but gnoll being 6 mana wouldn't really achieve that imo

[2023-01-05 16:41:15] <Rolnik_Stefan> shieldmaiden ends it
[2023-01-05 16:41:43] <crocovijk> more like Turn6stone
[2023-01-05 16:41:48] <!%J_Alexander_HS> They could bump up the first two mana thirsts

[2023-01-05 16:41:58] <Apock13> easy, instead of give 5 armor, it should be take 4 dmg.
[2023-01-05 16:42:09] <%+wyatt_hs> Is there a VS report today?
[2023-01-05 16:42:14] <%kesha_hs> cant be 5 mana turn 7
[2023-01-05 16:42:20] <%vicbiss> doesnt that make the meta even more burn focused'

[2023-01-05 16:42:28] <mike_smuggler> @j_alexander_hs  for the brotherhood
[2023-01-05 16:42:42] <Zoulis> Currently you do lose to the 5 armor. If they slow down the meta, it might not matter as much though making the nerf inconsequential
[2023-01-05 16:42:47] <Manwello> just make 3rd astalor 10 mana
[2023-01-05 16:42:56] <+cats_n_things> I hate this meta 😭
