[2022-12-20 06:34:37] <%+Achadna1> the dev is a cutie, but it does feel like this game would have save issues
[2022-12-20 06:35:13] <%+Cynder_Dragon> The game should have a few autosaves, especially if you change the autosave interval to every season?
[2022-12-20 06:35:17] <%+Cynder_Dragon> Unless the whole folder went poof

[2022-12-20 06:41:32] <%XellosMetallum> Hey Richard, what happened?

[2022-12-20 06:42:17] <PhyNFP> I know a few people who play TLD on interloper and it's basically all they've played all years. But they're not exactly big mechanical gamers.
[2022-12-20 06:42:25] <PhyNFP> But there's obviously something there that people are into.
[2022-12-20 06:42:36] <AC_ThirtySix> well they did say "losing is fun"

[2022-12-20 06:44:51] <%+Cynder_Dragon> richFine
[2022-12-20 06:45:14] <hurix> can load any save you like
[2022-12-20 06:45:52] <%+Cynder_Dragon> I think you can only create a new fort in the same world if your retire a fort that exists there
[2022-12-20 06:46:07] <+Suffoice> or delete the save I guess
[2022-12-20 06:46:11] <hurix> ah right you would have to abandon or pause, which requires loading it first. fuck

[2022-12-20 06:46:23] <%+Cynder_Dragon> It's a shame, it'd be almost cool to pass a save around and have multiple forts, pseudo-multiplayer
[2022-12-20 06:47:00] <%+Cynder_Dragon> Do you have save compression on/off? It's on by default. Just curious
[2022-12-20 06:47:27] <AC_ThirtySix> save compression has a bad history with corrupting saves

[2022-12-20 06:52:22] <hurix> so quick googling says you can delete save, keep World file, and it will recreate things out of it for you. but yea, obviously no idea if that works
[2022-12-20 06:53:40] <+Suffoice> so are all the saves like that or just the latest

[2022-12-20 06:58:47] <%+Brophdog88> but probably why you got an inkling to play
[2022-12-20 06:58:48] <Robocurious> you were prolly muted 20 mins ago

[2022-12-20 06:59:01] <%Dyrk> hard
[2022-12-20 06:59:08] <nightperson1> think it has some kinda story now
[2022-12-20 06:59:36] <AlexOfDoom> its a paid dlc according to steam
[2022-12-20 06:59:36] <hurix> remember the balls of steel tournament? just remembered that was a cool time
[2022-12-20 06:59:52] <%+Brophdog88> you get the story free if you bought the long dark
[2022-12-20 07:00:14] <%$mord_> Wintermute is the story, should have been free to the people that bought the game before it released

[2022-12-20 07:00:30] <AlexOfDoom> some of the new dlc contet is free judging by the steam page
[2022-12-20 07:00:46] <%$mord_> Tales from the Far Territory appears to have a bad community reception, buggy and not enough content for the cost
[2022-12-20 07:00:55] <%+Brophdog88> so, the dlc is a season pass for 12 months of content it seems
[2022-12-20 07:00:55] <!%Ellieanna> Long Dark is a Dick game
[2022-12-20 07:00:55] <%+Brophdog88> not all there yet
[2022-12-20 07:01:00] <%$mord_> it's apparently just a big empty open space
[2022-12-20 07:01:05] <%Tomijiro> looks like there's story mode and a survival mode
[2022-12-20 07:01:10] <%$mord_> with more content to come later
[2022-12-20 07:01:12] <%+Brophdog88> sounds like you can wait on dlc
[2022-12-20 07:01:13] <%Tomijiro> the dlc helps fill in the gaps?
[2022-12-20 07:01:22] <%+Achadna1> i read the first sentence on the steam page and the game called itself "thoughtful" which i kinda hate
[2022-12-20 07:01:54] <%+Brophdog88> from a review " It took me THREE DAYS to just walk from the old territories to the first meaningful location in the Forsaken Airfield."

[2022-12-20 07:03:10] <%Tomijiro> need to find parter or partners to do more Dark and Darker
[2022-12-20 07:03:11] <%+Brophdog88> its a game Id rather watch than Play I found out
[2022-12-20 07:03:11] <%EpicPumaNess> whats happening? something about a corrupted save? i was cutting my hair and couldn't pay alot of attention
[2022-12-20 07:03:22] <%Shamasu> It's called the long dark for a reason...
[2022-12-20 07:03:22] <!%Ellieanna> i play MP zomboid with complication, we enjoy it
[2022-12-20 07:03:56] <%$mord_> Speaking of long dark, one thing people are annoyed about is that the story chapters still aren't done
[2022-12-20 07:04:12] <%$mord_> which probably doesn't help to get people playing it

[2022-12-20 08:34:52] <%+MrZev> so in this game you can switch from Metric to Imperial.. but then they just use decimals.  Like 0.25 gallons.  instead of a quart.   Some part of me as a coder would love to do , somewhat in spite... you have 1 gallon, 2 quarts, 1 pint, 2 cups, 1 tablespoon, and 1 teaspoon of water.

[2022-12-20 12:50:12] <+Sean_Solo7> The DayZ dev streams this game a lot. It’s his favorite.

[2022-12-20 12:50:46] <Raikwood> man Isengard saw better days
[2022-12-20 12:51:06] <%Lakart> Isengard has also seen worse days richLUL
[2022-12-20 12:51:57] <+bl8dmoss> I remember when I first played this game I died in a small cabin because I had no firewood and could not break up and burn a small wooden chair :) I hope it is fixed.
[2022-12-20 12:52:00] <%Lakart> I feel like we should have parked our ass directly on the stovetop

[2022-12-20 12:53:03] <%+PirateBadgers> oh oke cirISee
[2022-12-20 12:53:11] <%Lakart> now this looks like a hut you can get warm in
[2022-12-20 12:53:23] <+bl8dmoss> @shyguyjd yeah, who would want to burn a chair anyhow, dying is easier
[2022-12-20 12:53:24] <%Lakart> oh its dicks ice fishing hut no wonder
[2022-12-20 12:53:51] <+shyguyjd> too many calories wasted doing it barehanded
[2022-12-20 12:53:58] <+bl8dmoss> I had tools

[2022-12-20 12:54:26] <+shyguyjd> was it dark
[2022-12-20 12:54:32] <+shyguyjd> you can't do shit in the dark
[2022-12-20 12:54:34] <+bl8dmoss> nope
[2022-12-20 12:54:37] <FriendmanBrother> this game came out in early access in 2014 holy smokes
[2022-12-20 12:54:51] <+shyguyjd> I call bullshit then
[2022-12-20 12:54:55] <+shyguyjd> try again
[2022-12-20 12:55:06] <%Convectt> I am waiting on the ice crack
[2022-12-20 12:55:10] <+bl8dmoss> but it was right after it came to early access so maybe there is a way now.
[2022-12-20 12:55:10] <$Darmanimon> depending on when it was it could have been a bug
[2022-12-20 12:55:21] <$Darmanimon> yeah if it was during early access that makes sense
[2022-12-20 12:55:57] <+shyguyjd> the ice in this is full of fuckery
[2022-12-20 12:56:00] <FinalAngel> I’ve been able to pull apart chairs with bare hands in the total darkness but it wouldn’t let me w a hatchet, this is like 2 weeks ago
[2022-12-20 12:56:04] <+shyguyjd> you think its thick, NOPE

[2022-12-20 12:56:28] <FinalAngel> I just came so idk the full context of the discussion but that’s my 10 cents lol
[2022-12-20 12:56:51] <+bl8dmoss> @FinalAngel good, that's like it should be
[2022-12-20 12:57:07] <+bl8dmoss> anyone can break a small chair
[2022-12-20 12:57:56] <FinalAngel> Yeah. It’s also worth noting that the bigger recliner that gave more resources could not be broken down by hand
[2022-12-20 12:58:06] VIEWERS: 650
[2022-12-20 12:58:07] <+shyguyjd> if you were too hungry, it wouldn't let you either
[2022-12-20 12:58:23] <+shyguyjd> too sleepy either
[2022-12-20 12:58:27] <FinalAngel> Ah I didn’t know that. Makes sense
[2022-12-20 12:58:49] <FinalAngel> Is this survival or story mode being played?
[2022-12-20 12:58:58] <+shyguyjd> lots of things can easily be mistaken for bugs that are just tiny game mechanics
[2022-12-20 12:59:54] <%+3Ducks_In_A_Coat> suggestions can be ideas

[2022-12-20 13:00:30] <+bl8dmoss> I should play this again, just checked and  "last played aug 5, 2017" There probably is great changes LUL
[2022-12-20 13:00:32] <%+MrZev> or with a gun or something
[2022-12-20 13:00:52] <+shyguyjd> there was a running joke that had the TLD community tinking that the flare actually did something other than being used as a weapon
[2022-12-20 13:01:04] <+shyguyjd> in the early days
[2022-12-20 13:01:18] <%Polkaderp> Would it even warm you up?
