[2023-01-07 11:53:16] <+McCape7> @Nocturnalsofa Ulduar is very special in this case because its the only raid where you can activate hardmode per encounter. Later in toc there is normal/heroic option

[2023-01-07 13:07:04] <$GaryOak_> Cheer200 Yesterday morning I ate an entire wheel of very expired cheese. It gave me horrible gas. I went into the bathtub and filled an empty peanut butter jar with the rising bubbles of my hot, rancid cheese farts. I sealed the jar and left it in the hot sun for 4 hours. Later, at dinner, I opened the jar under my mother's nose. The smell was unimaginable. Mom gagged and eventually vomited all over the carpet. "Why do you keep doing this, Jokered?!" she cried. LMGD hung his head in shame
