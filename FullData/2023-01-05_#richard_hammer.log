[2023-01-05 04:59:22] <%+Mhoram_> That's where my mind went to when you said cake. It is the only cake I prefer over pie
[2023-01-05 05:00:29] <+DigitalZips> Yep. Not a big fan of cake. Which is why I usually opt for an ice cream cake for my birthday
[2023-01-05 05:00:39] <%+Mhoram_> Pastry in general is better than cake.
[2023-01-05 05:00:49] <crimepuddles> cake is just so much of two textures in 90% of cases, the cake and the frosting

[2023-01-05 06:29:02] <%4D_linear_Sphere> i  have to imagine that getting a super realistic fishing rig is about the same as a driving one. but like. racing is probs on average more expensive than a rig to imitate it. fishing is probs either the same or more expensive.

[2023-01-05 07:13:17] <Wrenshrike> I don't know why exactly Denmark is considered part of Scandinavia. I'm guessing it's more because of shared history, than geographic reasons.
[2023-01-05 07:13:44] <%+Peisen> Yes
[2023-01-05 07:14:12] <Wrenshrike> Finland and Sweden are very similar, Norway is much more mountainous.
[2023-01-05 07:14:12] VIEWERS: 243
[2023-01-05 07:14:17] <%ItsHooligan> @Wrenshrike maybe because denmark used to be bigger?
[2023-01-05 07:14:21] <Wrenshrike> Denmark is fucking flat.
[2023-01-05 07:15:03] <Wrenshrike> Afaik, no. There might be a long bridge.
[2023-01-05 07:15:29] <%ItsHooligan> my ex is from denmark and she says they have a law that if the ice between denmark and sweden freezes and they try to walk over it they can legally hit them with sticks
[2023-01-05 07:15:54] <%+Peisen> @ItsHooligan Makes sense

[2023-01-05 07:17:13] <Wrenshrike> @Wrenshrike Maybe it's also because Denmark is made up of about 99% debris from scoring out our mountians during the ice age. LUL

[2023-01-05 07:19:32] <%+Peisen> Yes, it is. You still have to pay some taxes where you live though. Even if you're getting your money from another country
[2023-01-05 07:19:41] <Wrenshrike> Might be some funny tax stuff to navigate. I know a lot of Swedes work in Norwegian airports.

[2023-01-05 07:26:32] <Wrenshrike> I'm also guessing cross border work has to pay a good bit more than what is locally available in the border towns to be even close to worth it.
[2023-01-05 07:27:02] <Wrenshrike> Very few Norwegians work in Sweden for example, cause the pay in Norway is in general quite a bit higher.

[2023-01-05 08:24:18] <+Itsapaul> Chronos was zeus and most of the gods' dad
[2023-01-05 08:24:28] <%$kuakae> i think the greek gods in general werent. iirc the titans created it and the greek gods defeated them

[2023-01-05 08:24:43] <%+doomtrout> Because we read fucking books
[2023-01-05 08:24:44] <%Nomadicburrito> I used to like reading about this stuff
[2023-01-05 08:24:44] <Saighdear173> It's re-used in a lot of fiction

[2023-01-05 08:24:54] <%Nomadicburrito> and then I got out of middle school
[2023-01-05 08:24:55] <%EpicPumaNess> I grew up with the Percy Jackson books, so I kinda nerded out on them through middle school and just retained the information
[2023-01-05 08:24:55] <%KettleBlack> those are the gods
[2023-01-05 08:24:57] <+tertiaryextent> But there are all kinds of powerful dietiss like Athena
[2023-01-05 08:25:04] <+tertiaryextent> and Apollo
[2023-01-05 08:25:07] <Laioken13> i don't care i just remember everything i hear
[2023-01-05 08:25:09] <Wrenshrike> Did you have a bout this shit in school? Cause I think that's very common here in Europe?
[2023-01-05 08:25:16] <%Kardmager> Helps a lot of the lore was rehashed with you know that popular game Hades
[2023-01-05 08:25:18] <%+SlashSteel11> I've forgotten most of this, but there was a point where I watched a lot of history channel and knew most of it
[2023-01-05 08:25:20] <+DoubleNutz> I took mythology in school to fill my religious/theology credit
[2023-01-05 08:25:21] <%+doomtrout> Those things with ink and paper and shit
[2023-01-05 08:25:28] <Saighdear173> There used to be a saturday morning myths cartoon
[2023-01-05 08:25:34] <%$kuakae> well it was part of my education and it pops up in games and movies to some extent, so you kind of get it refreshed
[2023-01-05 08:25:42] <NullSignal> they took a lot of liberties with the lore in hades, but greek mythology is different depending on who you ask anyway
[2023-01-05 08:25:50] <%+Zmpr0wler> hades and Zeus are brothers
[2023-01-05 08:25:51] <%$kuakae> i also read the text in my videogames
[2023-01-05 08:25:57] <%Kardmager> Greek mythology was just way cooler than Christian stuff

[2023-01-05 08:26:44] <Saighdear173> Which purpose of devil?
[2023-01-05 08:26:44] <%+doomtrout> There isn't really a Devil in greek or norse iirc
[2023-01-05 08:26:44] <Wrenshrike> Hel is the queen of the underworld, but she's not really Hades equivalent.
[2023-01-05 08:26:45] <%nickelVeneer> Really Odin hates everything besides humans.
[2023-01-05 08:26:51] <%KettleBlack> what
[2023-01-05 08:26:54] <%+doomtrout> The Devil is more a christian thing
[2023-01-05 08:26:58] <Saighdear173> So ruler of the underworld?
[2023-01-05 08:26:58] <%Robocurious> hades isnt like the devil
[2023-01-05 08:26:59] <Sacred_Agent> isn't devil a christian thing

[2023-01-05 08:27:07] <$JudgementSenshi> well Hades isn't that bad of a guy
[2023-01-05 08:27:11] <$JudgementSenshi> he's just stuck with the shit job
[2023-01-05 08:27:12] <%Robocurious> in greek mythology the gods arent so perfect and they all do bad/good things
[2023-01-05 08:27:16] <Wrenshrike> Loki is closer to the Hades equivalent in what he does, but he is not the lord of the underworld.
[2023-01-05 08:27:23] <%+Zmpr0wler> you have after lives and locations like vahalla
[2023-01-05 08:27:32] <%EpicPumaNess> Surtr is the one who sets off Ragnorok
[2023-01-05 08:27:32] <$JudgementSenshi> Zeus does more evil than Hades could ever do
[2023-01-05 08:27:39] <%Robocurious> its not evil to rule over the underworld its important
[2023-01-05 08:27:48] <%Kardmager> He’s as evil as Poseidon and Zeus
[2023-01-05 08:27:48] <%+doomtrout> Nah, all the greek gods kinda sucked equally
[2023-01-05 08:27:54] <%EpicPumaNess> ^
[2023-01-05 08:28:01] <%+doomtrout> That was kinda the thing\
[2023-01-05 08:28:02] <%tyrolia_valerian> Hades has a job and he does his job
[2023-01-05 08:28:09] <%Robocurious> they were like super elites
[2023-01-05 08:28:11] <ShadowsparksTV> Have you watched The Boys?
[2023-01-05 08:28:12] <%EpicPumaNess> what else is there to do with infinite time but be an asshole tbh?
[2023-01-05 08:28:16] <%$kuakae> in omniscient reader he is a good guy
[2023-01-05 08:28:19] <$JudgementSenshi> Zeus literally named his bastard son after his wife so she wouldn't kill him
[2023-01-05 08:28:21] <Saighdear173> Greek gods were powerful humans basically. So they all sucked.
[2023-01-05 08:28:30] <%KettleBlack> ohh he was into it richShifty
[2023-01-05 08:28:32] <%+Brophdog88> there has to be a way to send mutliple of these

[2023-01-05 08:28:41] <%+doomtrout> I mean they're not
[2023-01-05 08:28:41] <%Robocurious> they arent
[2023-01-05 08:28:47] <%tyrolia_valerian> Hades holds dominion over everyone who died, good or evil. It's his domain.
[2023-01-05 08:28:48] <%+Zmpr0wler> zeus would rape women and do other really bad shit
[2023-01-05 08:29:00] <Saighdear173> The devil in christianity rebelled and tempts people. Hades is just in charge of where you go when you die regardless.
[2023-01-05 08:29:01] <%EpicPumaNess> They are similar, that's just when you realize they're not that bad because they're punishing sinners etc etc
[2023-01-05 08:29:11] <%Kardmager> It’s like saying morticians are evil people
[2023-01-05 08:29:34] <%Robocurious> you cant say that if you are christian though
[2023-01-05 08:29:38] <Laioken13> god sucks tbh

[2023-01-05 08:29:41] <Xansh> the devil isn't a god
[2023-01-05 08:29:43] <Xansh> hades is
[2023-01-05 08:29:46] <Saighdear173> Except by christianity whatever God says is inherently good.
[2023-01-05 08:29:48] <Wrenshrike> The difference is more in how it's portrayed I guess? God is supposed to be omnipotent and always right.
[2023-01-05 08:29:59] <ShadowsparksTV> I've seen Constantine. You can't fool me.
[2023-01-05 08:30:17] <%Robocurious> im saying that a follower of christ vs a follower of the greek pantheon view their deities through different lenses
[2023-01-05 08:30:18] <%+doomtrout> That IS the thing of christian mythology tho. God is all things Good, and the Devil is all things Evil
[2023-01-05 08:30:21] <Saighdear173> Hell is being cast out from the presence of god in christianity for the most part. Lots of things tacked on later
[2023-01-05 08:30:26] <%EpicPumaNess> There's so many different versions of religious and other forms of mythology, looking for an answer is gonna lead you down like 12 different paths that from their own writers perspective is correct

[2023-01-05 08:30:50] <%Robocurious> theres ONE correlation
[2023-01-05 08:30:51] <Sacred_Agent> good and evil depends on your beliefs, they are man made terms
[2023-01-05 08:30:52] <%+Brian_Lemons> I guess the similarities end in the sense that Hades isn't depicted as a tempter or root of evil or whatever
[2023-01-05 08:31:04] <%+doomtrout> The ONLY correlation is they have an underworld
[2023-01-05 08:31:08] <%Kardmager> I think you just see that because They both underground
[2023-01-05 08:31:11] <%+doomtrout> That's it
[2023-01-05 08:31:12] <%+Brian_Lemons> but the whole "place where people go when they die" thing is, yeah
[2023-01-05 08:31:15] <%KettleBlack> well Hades might be thir word for hell.. BUTTTTTTTT  richT richT richT
[2023-01-05 08:31:26] <Saighdear173> Hades isn't a creation of zeus like the devil is to god for christians
[2023-01-05 08:31:29] <+Itsapaul> I'd say Dionysis is more the temptation dude
[2023-01-05 08:31:35] <%+Brian_Lemons> St Peter or whatever
[2023-01-05 08:31:39] <+tertiaryextent> Michael
[2023-01-05 08:31:39] <%+Zmpr0wler> St. Peter
[2023-01-05 08:31:42] <%+doomtrout> But heaven is ALSO an underworld in a way
[2023-01-05 08:31:51] <%nickelVeneer> I feel like Christianity really tries to portray god as good/flawless to the point that he is not the story. Humans are the story in the bible. Meanwhile in greek + norse mythos the gods are interesting, flawed characters to tell us about human nature.
[2023-01-05 08:31:57] <%KettleBlack> uigh
[2023-01-05 08:31:57] <%+doomtrout> Cuz the underworld was just "The Land Of The Dead"
[2023-01-05 08:32:23] <%Kardmager> Zeus got Heaven, Poseidon got the sea, and Hades got the underworld. They are also brothers
[2023-01-05 08:32:31] <%+Brophdog88> always remember the titans
[2023-01-05 08:32:32] <+tertiaryextent> Cronus

[2023-01-05 08:32:45] <$JudgementSenshi> Noah?
[2023-01-05 08:32:49] <Saighdear173> Greek myths aren't supposed to save your eternal soul, christianity is. They had different purposes.
[2023-01-05 08:32:53] <ShadowsparksTV> Boat dude? Noah?
[2023-01-05 08:33:13] <%EpicPumaNess> a lot of religious stuff, greek, norse, chrsitianity, have a lot in common if you delve deep enough
[2023-01-05 08:33:17] <%+Brian_Lemons> there's actually an interesting historical record of the idea of Heaven = pure good, and more akin to greek underworld, with just an eternal damnation spin with the dynamic of hell after that
[2023-01-05 08:33:25] <Fluxgry> he flooded the Earth because he saw capitalism coming ;p
[2023-01-05 08:33:26] <+DoubleNutz> the great deluge story was also found in prior civilizations like the akkadians and sumerians
[2023-01-05 08:33:30] <%KettleBlack> shhh... we cut the weird shit out of the bible

[2023-01-05 08:34:04] <%nickelVeneer> Yeah, the underworld is punishment for some people. But not all in greek mythos.

[2023-01-05 08:34:06] <+Itsapaul> The most I remember about Hades is he yoinked some chick to be his wife
[2023-01-05 08:34:23] <%+doomtrout> Underworld is both heaven and hell, so
[2023-01-05 08:34:23] <Saighdear173> Greek gods are humans enlarged to show detail
[2023-01-05 08:34:26] <%EpicPumaNess> trying to condense thousands of years of mythology and religious lore in chat is really difficult
[2023-01-05 08:34:27] <Saighdear173> I think zeus
[2023-01-05 08:34:29] <%+Brian_Lemons> there's definitely specific people that got punished in the underworld but that had a lot more to do with petty god actions
[2023-01-05 08:34:34] <%+Zmpr0wler> zeus

[2023-01-05 08:35:06] <$JudgementSenshi> Hades punished him for cheating death I think
[2023-01-05 08:35:09] <Fluxgry> he said "Hey dudes" so all called him.... :p
[2023-01-05 08:35:13] <%+doomtrout> Zeus is the guy who strapped a guy to a rock to have eagles eat his liver for all eternity so
[2023-01-05 08:35:21] <%+Zmpr0wler> Hades punished and "pleasured"
[2023-01-05 08:35:23] <%Kardmager> Same thing with Prometheus, Zeus did it
[2023-01-05 08:36:05] <%+Brian_Lemons> Sisyphus's rock rolling was punishment for doing the life equivalent of ban evasion
[2023-01-05 08:36:05] <+tertiaryextent> Hades punished Tantalus

[2023-01-05 08:41:03] <$JudgementSenshi> Hellenism
[2023-01-05 08:41:13] <%+doomtrout> Cuz greek "religion" was more of a collection of cults, historically speaking
[2023-01-05 08:41:23] <Fluxgry> heliocentrism...
[2023-01-05 08:41:28] <+tertiaryextent> θρησκεία

[2023-01-05 08:41:55] <Fluxgry> ye it looks greekish

[2023-01-05 08:42:15] <Saighdear173> Those are all greek letters, math tells me so.
[2023-01-05 08:42:15] <%+doomtrout> The religion I still don't Get is ancient Egyptian lmao
[2023-01-05 08:42:18] <Wrenshrike> Can confirm, it's greek.
[2023-01-05 08:42:20] <%+Brian_Lemons> There’s also the question on how heavily people believed the surviving stories from Greek myth. Like, a lot of the stories are real sexy and scandalous, it might have just been a form of entertainment
[2023-01-05 08:42:26] <Fluxgry> rus doesn't have such funky letters
[2023-01-05 08:42:28] <SADDIDA> hi

[2023-01-05 08:42:47] <%$kuakae> read up on sisyphus (the rock rolling guy) and apparently when he should have been punished he tricked the punisher („the grim reaper“) and chained him up, resulting in people being unable to die. Ares the god of war got pissed at that because it took the fun out of war and intervened… seems like sisyphos almost gave us immortality
[2023-01-05 08:42:49] <%+jxnkins> @doomtrout man, ancient egyptian is awesome
[2023-01-05 08:43:08] <Laioken13> egyption god lore gets crazy

[2023-01-05 08:43:46] <$JudgementSenshi> Not the Osiris myth...
[2023-01-05 08:44:01] <ShadowsparksTV> @doomtrout You know God's Only Fans?
[2023-01-05 08:44:04] <%Kardmager> Isn’t osiris a show brand?

[2023-01-05 08:45:11] <%+doomtrout> Not in like an edgy atheist way it's just the term for it
[2023-01-05 08:45:22] <%$kuakae> @fluxgry that was only after the whole incident when he got actually punished and hades played his electric guitar to commemorate the moment

[2023-01-05 08:59:52] <%+Zmpr0wler> they make alot of 4 to 5 dollar games that you can play for 30+ hours
[2023-01-05 08:59:56] <%Kardmager> They still make fancy ones
[2023-01-05 09:00:14] <%Kardmager> I think a “pro” one is like $80-$120 I think

[2023-01-05 09:08:57] <%+Zmpr0wler> with all the updates they added at least 50 hours to the game if you rush it
