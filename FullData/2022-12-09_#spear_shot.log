[2022-12-09 16:38:32] <%Arhil120> if he lands an ability he can consume a mark to deal %hp damage to the target
[2022-12-09 16:38:36] <%Zekray24> passive marks enemies hit with abilites, aaing them does more damage
[2022-12-09 16:38:37] <CoBaLtRSA> passive = spell hit then auto to do bonus dmg, bonus dmg is true dmg in ult
