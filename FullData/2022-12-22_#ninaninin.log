[2022-12-22 22:23:04] <Arcterion> 'Warlock' means something like "oath breaker" or some shit.

[2022-12-22 22:23:51] <%MrFoois> it's a pact with some kind of entity, the entity doesn't have to be a demon or evil
[2022-12-22 22:23:55] <%agryppa> in DnD you can have a pact with a celestial
[2022-12-22 22:23:59] <%$2ndDant> they just need a pact from some sort of Extraplanar entoty  IIRC ninin404
[2022-12-22 22:24:01] <%N0bbody> Warlocks can pick good natured patrons instead of the usual devils
[2022-12-22 22:24:02] <%sikhand> Warlocks have a patron, which can be demonas, devils, or even stuff like fey or celestials.
