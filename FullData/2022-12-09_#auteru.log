[2022-12-09 03:44:06] <%SleepieWolfie> although a beautifully animated series would be nice, the cutscenes are beautiful
[2022-12-09 03:44:10] <%$Layzay73> Diablo is the Original I'd say , right ?
[2022-12-09 03:44:13] <%DolanDoggo> but blizzard milking players too much
[2022-12-09 03:44:16] <@%Meyvol> Diablo is both amazing and infuriating.
[2022-12-09 03:44:19] <%TachikomaKURO> Good franchise. but third game was its low point. and the less we talk about Diablo Immortal, the better
[2022-12-09 03:44:22] <%bobinsson> this one is looking good, they showed a bit of gameplay
[2022-12-09 03:45:09] VIEWERS: 335
[2022-12-09 03:45:20] <@%Meyvol> Playing through the story to beat the game, is enjoyable. But the infinite grind for the items you want is where it makes you mad at drop rates and mechanics.

[2022-12-09 04:23:33] <%TachikomaKURO> True, Teru. as soon as player. count began to decrease, it was a sign Elden Ring wasn't as relevant anymore
[2022-12-09 04:23:37] <%bobinsson> gow is winning everything LuL
[2022-12-09 04:23:52] <%TachikomaKURO> Still I'm worried about From Software

[2022-12-09 04:28:36] <%NaguNak> I don't agree that they voted because previous were good tho, a lot of people who played the new GOW games have never played the original 3
