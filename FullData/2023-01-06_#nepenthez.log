[2023-01-06 17:44:33] <ussy12356> mahrez looks decent tbh
[2023-01-06 17:44:36] <+allopir> how many city players in this promo? should just be city players from the centurions season

[2023-01-06 17:45:04] <$BRT14_> Mahrez will be overpriced to bits aswell
[2023-01-06 17:45:11] VIEWERS: 465
[2023-01-06 17:45:11] <bigwiss98> mahrez just looks decent because he's from prem and will have 5*
[2023-01-06 17:45:11] <+NoToeJoe7> EA usually try to put out a promo that people with saved packs will want to open before toty
[2023-01-06 17:45:13] <%mannyn90> im doing mahrez purely for the fifa21 headliner nostalgia
[2023-01-06 17:45:21] <%+Kieran96cfc> if mahrez can play cam that will be decent
[2023-01-06 17:45:24] <ajohno28> Can’t wait for mahrez
[2023-01-06 17:45:25] <+allopir> he's gonna be so expensive if sbc
[2023-01-06 17:45:25] <%GlasgowFIFA> that Marhez would have to be lower than Di Maria to complete him
[2023-01-06 17:45:27] <+Juelz_21> I guess am gonna b saving packs for team of the year then lol
[2023-01-06 17:45:29] <ussy12356> Who could you compare mahrez too?
[2023-01-06 17:45:33] <@%Witchwalker70> Thanks @kahnbayern @erpeka1993 👍

[2023-01-06 17:45:48] <shaunselfieking20> I even said that to one of my mates that so far I looked at it and it doesn’t look great this promo from what I’ve seen
[2023-01-06 17:45:50] <%blazer33x> and we got toty coming after that
[2023-01-06 17:46:04] <lior636> theres been so many ocassions where the promo cards were a lot better from what the leaks were saying
[2023-01-06 17:46:13] <%$max_kingsley> I still think the Overall Rating is irrelevant, what matters are the Ingame Stats
[2023-01-06 17:46:19] <foreheadluke23> do we know what date toty starts?
[2023-01-06 17:46:25] <here4rewards_> I would’ve thought they would release a great team to entice people to open saved TOTY packs
[2023-01-06 17:46:34] <ussy12356> same @max_kingsley
[2023-01-06 17:46:35] <%$petejb1990> In previous times would’ve looked at that Milner and thought cool he’s gullit gang but now I’m totally not bothered by it

[2023-01-06 17:48:00] <@sorarejosh> its just constant sideways upgrades atm , and with all our players being untradable theres no incentive to this promo

[2023-01-06 17:48:04] <zachary3210> hi nep

[2023-01-06 17:48:10] <Mochinoooo> you're not far from the truth it will be like any other promo just a reskin
[2023-01-06 17:48:21] <shaunselfieking20> I saved about 80 packs for centurions 😂

[2023-01-06 17:51:28] <blackfire_razvan> DID U player FIFA MOBILE
[2023-01-06 17:51:33] <blackfire_razvan> ?
[2023-01-06 17:51:38] <%+erpeka1993> @kahnbayern are you sure? 😂 is it worth it
[2023-01-06 17:51:39] <%philllaws1981> any news on Felix to Arsenal or United Nep?
[2023-01-06 17:51:41] <hernancrespo2022> Nep regardless the zlatan card is gonna be way better than all the strikers we’ve had so far apart from payet
[2023-01-06 17:51:54] <UsefulSpark82> Got back into FIFA and FUT for first time since FIFA 16, and while I’m really enjoying the grind, I remember the new cards being flashy and great. These all feel like EA just said “eh lets just slap a +3 on a few players stats.” Neymar and Mahrez being a 91 and 89 as their tops is insane to me. Should be like 95 and 94 imo. Make them worth it for us to go after them. Also, SBC fodder is nonexistent
[2023-01-06 17:52:07] <%unofut> Hellow @NepentheZ and the rest as well :)
[2023-01-06 17:52:09] <blackfire_razvan> DID U player FIFA MOBILE

[2023-01-06 18:35:44] <%+MlKE_2023> @aaronbrookes94 yeah that’s why I don’t get why arsenal sold him. If they had him I think he makes arsenal more likely to win the league
[2023-01-06 18:35:46] <jack_russell67> hleb was underrated guy would have 99 dribbling on fifa

[2023-01-06 18:36:31] <%FUTDAN26> I searched him on YouTube he looks very fast and skillful but that is against teams in Ukraine
[2023-01-06 18:36:38] <snipingmachine16> zinchenko too

[2023-01-06 18:37:09] <%FUTDAN26> Shevchenko was amazing til he came to chelsea and we finished his career 😂

[2023-01-06 18:48:59] <+rmartin31> that’s the whole problem with the power curve being so evolved so early in the game… TOTY is only going to push it further, so so many of these cards will be poor in a months time
[2023-01-06 18:49:00] <+KChatha2001> ive been using courtois
[2023-01-06 18:49:02] <+johnnyw40> Who’s been leaked for centurions?
[2023-01-06 18:49:03] <@%$ItsTr3ple> Payet has 100 goals and 100 assists, but surely he won't get another card

[2023-01-06 19:13:58] <boomwap5499> How can Milner stamina be 80 something. He beats all Liverpool players in training year on year in fitness
[2023-01-06 19:13:59] <m4nny1403> Hawk @nightbot
[2023-01-06 19:14:04] <yungmaseyy> @dale20t That has nothing to do with pace it’s his stamina

[2023-01-06 19:14:40] <%$lfcplz> damn Orsic has gone to Southampton, hope he gets another banging promo card at some point
[2023-01-06 19:14:40] <+zeebow172> Some of the stats are lower than leaked! Kimpembe was an 87, wonder if ea mad a late change
[2023-01-06 19:14:40] <olly2g> was he not the Liverpool cm on loading screen?
[2023-01-06 19:14:43] <potandste> compare trent to trippier

[2023-01-06 19:14:53] <+GeorgeCuz> giant throw in for trent is kinda nice
[2023-01-06 19:14:54] <+tutenioo> It is possible to get 3 Centurions from silver upgrades
[2023-01-06 19:14:55] <potandste> is trent better than trippier?
[2023-01-06 19:14:57] <ea_shay_fan_account> Full backs are always cheap though tbf
[2023-01-06 19:15:00] <N8_O> @lukemaster02 I think they've released them all
[2023-01-06 19:15:00] <blacknardis> Bro is mad that cards are affordable

[2023-01-06 19:15:14] <%+Surrengar> @stevensessions idk if i should hold or sell and buy back later, 320k looks cheap for him
[2023-01-06 19:15:18] <misschmassh21> No ibrahimovic is a robbery
[2023-01-06 19:15:23] <%+PickleRick07> they dont come out as first card in packs. got veratti 87 an had milner and vardy behind it
[2023-01-06 19:15:25] <%+theoldmanrtg7619> 87 reactions
[2023-01-06 19:15:31] <Crvwned> now kimpembe is broken
[2023-01-06 19:15:32] <%+connorrm14> Remember when they didn’t know how to add traits. They must have figured that problem out😂
[2023-01-06 19:15:36] <williamruss15> none of these new cards get in my team
[2023-01-06 19:15:38] <ea_shay_fan_account> Too late

[2023-01-06 19:16:27] <+Fenity> since they said team 1 do you think it's worth saving packs until team 2 chat?
[2023-01-06 19:16:29] <dark_void13> Who do I pick desailly van der ser or zambrotta
[2023-01-06 19:16:31] <Its_lakitch44> Yeah compared to di Maria it’s not worth

[2023-01-06 19:19:00] <+mclovingotgames> I just wished they made the card a bit better than the power curve
[2023-01-06 19:19:00] <here4rewards_> easy decision on saving my packs for TOTY LUL
[2023-01-06 19:19:02] <%OakleyBromfield> Why are people saying they are Live cards/
[2023-01-06 19:19:03] <%+JEAP89> Imagine if they got a stat boost at 100 games played for your club
[2023-01-06 19:19:04] <cfc_Ray19> there's another team LUL ffs
[2023-01-06 19:19:08] <ea_shay_fan_account> Bring WW back LUL

[2023-01-06 19:19:12] <njw2907> almost as bad as the adidas promo from last year
[2023-01-06 19:19:12] <sndz97> 85 rated promo cards in January
[2023-01-06 19:19:13] <+ramafh> what if they get a stat boost at 100 games
[2023-01-06 19:19:16] <furious_shacksta> Why is it trash i Just got here?
[2023-01-06 19:19:16] <N8_O> There are a few decent cards
[2023-01-06 19:19:16] <%+mikekozy23> time to spam champs then save packs and go have a good weekend elsewhere
[2023-01-06 19:19:20] <%blazer33x> look on the bright side Nep
[2023-01-06 19:19:22] <%Benz_soloelite1> yeah I agree with all those just saving my packs.
[2023-01-06 19:19:22] <thelittlest2k> feels like filler
[2023-01-06 19:19:22] <+RazorKameo> even WC was better
[2023-01-06 19:19:22] <+snakeebtw> huh?
[2023-01-06 19:19:23] <David_o0o1> clowns saying they upgrade
[2023-01-06 19:19:24] <bangee> good idea, bad execution of the idea
[2023-01-06 19:19:24] <%$dawfoot> they should give special rewards if you score/assist/play 100 games with them
[2023-01-06 19:19:24] <@sorarejosh> like always bad execution
[2023-01-06 19:19:27] <%johnfive21> Imagine they upgrade after reaching 100 matches/goals/assists for your team?
[2023-01-06 19:19:27] <%+rparr94> Numbers up was the worst
[2023-01-06 19:19:28] <%+jay_alaw92> I think they made the power curve far to high to early and now they’re just going horizontal to try and balance it out
[2023-01-06 19:19:28] <%OakleyBromfield> One of the best Card Designs too!
[2023-01-06 19:19:29] <@%Witchwalker70> A nice card design, that's it
[2023-01-06 19:19:29] <+r272727> worst promo ever tbh
[2023-01-06 19:19:32] <+BloodBucketz> world cup was better than this, and world cup was a dead promo lmao
[2023-01-06 19:19:36] <Eridon89> kinda nice, makes you save for TOTY
[2023-01-06 19:19:36] <OW3NN_> What is the concept of the promo?
[2023-01-06 19:19:36] <+snakeebtw> toty is around the corner to be fair
[2023-01-06 19:19:36] <jfar98> They don’t upgrade
[2023-01-06 19:19:39] <+wilderness_kid> Shall I open my 40 packs on this promo. They’re burning a hole in my pocket?
[2023-01-06 19:19:40] <deziixixv> future stars needed
[2023-01-06 19:19:41] <%+Kieran96cfc> they should have made them upgrade every 100 games or goals ect
[2023-01-06 19:19:42] <chrisd_95> It looks like a best of totw
[2023-01-06 19:19:42] <%+Gworv> they are trying to destroy the fifa name ready for next year
[2023-01-06 19:19:43] <%Sammystaa> have a icon pack for you bro
[2023-01-06 19:19:45] <B3LGian_BeaStX> the players should be able to get upgrades based on their 100 stat
[2023-01-06 19:19:45] <roguebarney123> is king going to be a sbc
[2023-01-06 19:19:46] <%+JEAP89> It’s filler to TOTY unfortunately
[2023-01-06 19:19:47] <%CrazyEskimoPenguin> So poorly executed
[2023-01-06 19:19:51] <williamruss15> most teams are full of icons and heros ,, these cards are trash
[2023-01-06 19:19:51] [Notification] LawsonJP subscribed with Prime.
[2023-01-06 19:19:52] <+glendalf99> Would be cool, if they got upgrades for playing a 100 games with the card or 100 goals etc

[2023-01-06 19:19:58] <%+Metcalfe11> hovering over transfers the billboard says they recieve static but permanent upgrade?1?!
[2023-01-06 19:19:58] <peggerz154> It’s always the same players
[2023-01-06 19:20:00] <%+koojababy10> Damn WW was peak fifa 23 😭😭
[2023-01-06 19:20:01] <Dash_counter7> which was better this promo or winter wildcard team 2?
[2023-01-06 19:20:02] <%fitzyyy7> Numbers up vibes
[2023-01-06 19:20:02] <+mikec134> ea just don't understand the power curve
[2023-01-06 19:20:13] <martinkennedy3107> Got baby blanc baby Ferdinand and 87 zanetti out my icon pick who would you guys take?
[2023-01-06 19:20:13] <%+oliver21k> Trent’s not got 100 caps, goals or assists anyway so why is he there
[2023-01-06 19:20:13] <+gwenbruh> isnt that the same with every promo, a handful of good cards then trash?
[2023-01-06 19:20:13] <+TimToMontys> why not just give us 6 really good cards and leave the rubbish ones out
[2023-01-06 19:20:15] <%+ColeTrain3> stocking filler promo
[2023-01-06 19:20:15] <+georgec1409> I need Milner and Trent asap
[2023-01-06 19:20:17] <N8_O> TOTY will be soon
[2023-01-06 19:20:21] BITS: dawfoot (100)
[2023-01-06 19:20:21] <%$dawfoot> Cheer100 they should give special rewards or upgrades if you score/assist/play 100 games with them
[2023-01-06 19:20:21] <enricorabbitte> Should I buy winter 50k
[2023-01-06 19:20:22] <+abuzzlobster191> “Centurions receive static permanent upgrades” in the menu screen
[2023-01-06 19:20:22] <%+jezzatee2x> Packed Trent and sold straight away, not worth 200k more than Trippier
[2023-01-06 19:20:23] <Mutasem_jr> When is toty??
[2023-01-06 19:20:24] <%+mykill91> bye
[2023-01-06 19:20:25] <%+KingKarim__> Dead cards
[2023-01-06 19:20:25] <jetroperconize> This promo is ass man like even tho there are nice cards like pelegrini and rebic ECT... but I'll need whole lotta packs to get just one and there is bunch of alternative for them. Even the upgrades they got is somewhat unnoticeable and those players that everyone wants like Neymar and Ben yedder only fifa points maniacs like Bateson can afford. EA'S GREED NEEDS TO STOP IT'S KILLING THE GAME FFS
[2023-01-06 19:20:26] <ea_shay_fan_account> Why not just give us the silver promo instead of this filler trash
[2023-01-06 19:20:27] <+mclovingotgames> Booooooo EA

[2023-01-06 19:20:37] <korneelvw> One day we think they gonna up the power curve with Politano, the next day they release this dead content.
[2023-01-06 19:20:39] <steele1921> Already off fifa at 6:20 on a Friday.
[2023-01-06 19:20:40] <%exclusive457> the most disappointing promo to date
[2023-01-06 19:20:43] <olliedafc> Just proof EA want to make the game untradeable in the future and get rid of the transfer market
[2023-01-06 19:20:44] <+finplaysfifa11> Stop complaining
[2023-01-06 19:20:45] <cfc_Ray19> so saving my packs for 2 weeks these are garbage
[2023-01-06 19:20:47] <+johnh3nr1k> It’s almost like EA is giving out content for the players who got the game for christmas
[2023-01-06 19:20:47] <%mbesh> packed rebic so seems class
[2023-01-06 19:20:48] <enricorabbitte> Should I buy winter 50k?

[2023-01-06 19:20:57] <%+ty97x> With Toty coming soon why can’t they just boost the upgrades they give players more I mean no one would complain instead of 85 discard promo cards
[2023-01-06 19:20:59] <+migooo15> Ea is a**

[2023-01-06 19:21:10] <UsefulSpark82> Could this be a way of EA trying to influence the market before TOTY?
[2023-01-06 19:21:10] <%Sammystaa> !psn
[2023-01-06 19:21:11] <@^Nightbot>* NepentehZ
[2023-01-06 19:21:12] <+viperkeith> The cards are average as the power curve was pushed so high so fast
[2023-01-06 19:21:15] <%+shezzzzzzzz> doing shareplays for icon picks nep?
[2023-01-06 19:21:16] <%$kinglester2692> no i wouldn't want to play 100 games with most the cards
[2023-01-06 19:21:16] <+eduu_11> trippier stats are more or less the same as Trent and it's just for two tokens
[2023-01-06 19:21:16] <+Zuboronovic> I've got 100+ packs that I've been saving up. I don't really want to waste them on this but also don't want to keep holding.
[2023-01-06 19:21:19] <dcbeatbox> *just got
[2023-01-06 19:21:19] <+xxMillhouse> yeah no reason to open packs. already have a solid team, so might as well wait for toty I guess
[2023-01-06 19:21:20] <%$darwinswift> Dunno whether to pass on this promo now an save the packs
[2023-01-06 19:21:21] <+mclovingotgames> Well at least we still have the Base Icon pick💀💀😂😂

[2023-01-06 19:21:23] <%+AaronC2995> If they wanted to tempt people to open packs they were saving for toty this wasn't the way to do it
[2023-01-06 19:21:25] <jhunter123> The timing of this promo was all wrong
[2023-01-06 19:21:25] <Rubendran17> Game’s lagging bad
[2023-01-06 19:21:27] <flow_sensei> promo so dead
[2023-01-06 19:21:31] <leedsjason123> It could have being objective player like a Dybala, score 100 get a better rating, 100 assists get a weak foot, 100 games get x 100 wins get something else
[2023-01-06 19:21:34] <+snakeebtw> filler promo for toty dont know why everyone surprised

[2023-01-06 19:21:41] <p0rce> garbo
[2023-01-06 19:21:41] <N8_O> If the average promo card is 87ish in January then we are generally on track to keep a lower power curve until TOTY and TOTS
[2023-01-06 19:21:41] <harithh_17> when silver stars getting released sucha good promo last year but a at a bad time when tots came soon

[2023-01-06 19:21:56] <%BrackenWBA10> Feels like fifa is just a pointless cycle now
[2023-01-06 19:21:57] <%+KapzeMcLovin> Probably the most L promo this year
[2023-01-06 19:22:00] <%+Kieran96cfc> next promo is TOTY no?
[2023-01-06 19:22:00] <$medara55> This is the worst promo this year
[2023-01-06 19:22:00] <p0rce> toty or bust for me
[2023-01-06 19:22:01] <darkheist8819> Filler promo before TOTY

[2023-01-06 19:22:03] <keith_mercer89> Next Promo will be TOTY
[2023-01-06 19:22:04] <olly2g> honestly might be worse than Adidas numbers up
[2023-01-06 19:22:04] <%+N8_FUT> It's EA's way of telling people to save packs for TOTY
[2023-01-06 19:22:05] <+jezbam666> Would you say this promo is as bad as last years Numbers Up Promo?
[2023-01-06 19:22:05] <%OakleyBromfield> Saving for TOTY for me
[2023-01-06 19:22:05] <FPLElmer_YT> this is up there with the adiddas promo
[2023-01-06 19:22:06] <+giarc721> filling the gap between WC and TOTY still
[2023-01-06 19:22:06] <%+stackmillz> i think milner trent look good
[2023-01-06 19:22:06] <+viperkeith> They just reigning in the power curve
[2023-01-06 19:22:07] <+gwenbruh> being a lil harsh
[2023-01-06 19:22:07] <%awaydayoffender> i think we need to try a few cards to see how they play in game
[2023-01-06 19:22:08] <%LawsonJP> I had packs saved for today, saving them for toty now
[2023-01-06 19:22:08] <+myactiveagent> Almost none of them make my team
[2023-01-06 19:22:08] <ussy12356> exactly!!
[2023-01-06 19:22:08] <layton754> This promo was a let down
[2023-01-06 19:22:09] <+abuzzlobster191> Go to transfers tab
[2023-01-06 19:22:09] <%+UmarAbba> Till TOTY

[2023-01-06 19:22:12] <+Nycom76> Are these cards live ?
[2023-01-06 19:22:13] <+ernart> Jus save for TOTY.
[2023-01-06 19:22:13] <@%AaronBrookes94> Interesting idea, but it's a promo for the sake of a promo. Which is the problem with FIFA
[2023-01-06 19:22:14] <Rubendran17> Which is worthless in the end
[2023-01-06 19:22:14] <korneelvw> This is even worse then the WC
[2023-01-06 19:22:14] <+smedzz_> We need future stars asap
[2023-01-06 19:22:14] <WHIST1414> i think i'm stupid. i mistakenly put 10 WC tokens in the 25x 83+ standalone SBC
[2023-01-06 19:22:15] <+mattogden> hover over the transfers tab it talks about an upgrade ?
[2023-01-06 19:22:15] <%+bigoggerzz> next promo is toty
[2023-01-06 19:22:16] <peggerz154> It’s always the same players
[2023-01-06 19:22:16] <hellface77> Absolute garbage Promo
[2023-01-06 19:22:18] <ea_shay_fan_account> TOTY is in 2 weeks
[2023-01-06 19:22:19] <N8_O> I'm not bothered by it much, it's content I guess
[2023-01-06 19:22:19] <Brady2109> haven't gotten 1 yet from 30 packs. 10 left to open
[2023-01-06 19:22:19] <+hellysampson> I only save for toty
[2023-01-06 19:22:20] <saca__> 😭 saving packs for fifa 24
[2023-01-06 19:22:21] <fatfortnitevirgin> no point grinding this week I guess??
[2023-01-06 19:22:22] <itsRamzilla> save packs for TOTY and that's it.
[2023-01-06 19:22:22] <+hellysampson> And maybe tots
[2023-01-06 19:22:23] <%+KapzeMcLovin> It had so much potential as well :(
[2023-01-06 19:22:23] <notnotspartans0453> I mean pack savings for toty? Wdym
[2023-01-06 19:22:23] <friskyflannel> the next promo is TOTY though, bit different

[2023-01-06 19:22:25] <%+Th1sSecretN1nj4> worst promo this year...tbh this year outside of WW has been terrible.

[2023-01-06 19:22:26] <%+paulmc93> I'm opening my packs anyway regardless
[2023-01-06 19:22:26] <+snakeebtw> you save packs for good promos obliviously
[2023-01-06 19:22:29] <$LilFishFart> i dont like the card design either
[2023-01-06 19:22:29] <Rubendran17> Watch TOTY players be shit
[2023-01-06 19:22:29] <mrfasth22> its a team 2 next friday right?
[2023-01-06 19:22:29] <scorp1on_dk2300> somebody on a danish fifa group on Facebook just bhought an untradeable bernado silva on the market
[2023-01-06 19:22:29] <+Waterhouse1988> Just another ea letdown
[2023-01-06 19:22:30] [Notification] jnjorge subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months, currently on a 1 month streak!
[2023-01-06 19:22:31] <+NatSCFC> Will my saved packs have TOTYs in?
[2023-01-06 19:22:32] <%$Wrennie1919> The most frustrating thing is its the same players yet again
[2023-01-06 19:22:33] <+BloodBucketz> when you realize we've got team 2 still to come, 2 weeks of this trash
[2023-01-06 19:22:33] <$PirloNotImprsessed> Wish I’d ripped my packs for varane now.. unlikely to have got him but worth the gamble over this
[2023-01-06 19:22:39] <+Romanlamagna> It’s just lame
[2023-01-06 19:22:39] <aubamebloodclatyang> do you screen share discord
[2023-01-06 19:22:39] <dcbeatbox> Just got Yedder in 80 +5
[2023-01-06 19:22:40] <blackfire_razvan> SUBSCRIBE TO(blackfire_razvan)
[2023-01-06 19:22:40] <%+BotBill32> This is so dead!
[2023-01-06 19:22:42] <zipcan> SB objective is nice. Easy 87 for fodder.
[2023-01-06 19:22:42] <%+pennywisdom2100> Good idea, but I'm just going to save for toty, any card I'd like will be really cheap anyway
[2023-01-06 19:22:42] <loofa717> The cards are already in draft
[2023-01-06 19:22:43] <fatfortnitevirgin> last weeks promo was better. y they going backwards lmao
[2023-01-06 19:22:44] BAN: blackfire_razvan
[2023-01-06 19:22:45] <%+stackmillz> they are tryin to keep the power curve down
[2023-01-06 19:22:46] <+ishyo52> when should we start saving for toty? or is it worthless at this point?
[2023-01-06 19:22:47] <%+koojababy10> What did TAA do to have a centurions card????
[2023-01-06 19:22:49] <+eduu_11> I expected a lot, but now i'll be waiting for the next promo.
[2023-01-06 19:22:50] <+Jspatch7> Team of the year can’t be dead man
[2023-01-06 19:22:51] <%+jacktwoodard00> Ffs castle wall can't do that shit
[2023-01-06 19:22:51] <+hennuthiinggoes> 2 week filler before toty
[2023-01-06 19:22:52] <%+Kieran96cfc> they shouldnt give us promos for the 1st month or 2 of FIFA so promos dont have to be such a massive boost in power curve everytime
[2023-01-06 19:22:53] <+roryanderson11> A don’t get the point of the promo majority of the cards are so behind the power curve
[2023-01-06 19:22:53] <Vladmetalhead> is this worse than numbers up from last year ?
[2023-01-06 19:22:54] <+snakeebtw> adblocker
[2023-01-06 19:22:54] <%+KingKarim__> Nah I’m still open my packs I need fodda for zidane
[2023-01-06 19:22:55] <+jrossino> This icon PP gives some the trash every time man what’s the point
[2023-01-06 19:22:56] <baileyrubs> I got Ronaldinho
[2023-01-06 19:22:58] <+mattia_8801> im glad i didnt switch off football manager
[2023-01-06 19:22:59] <%+bigoggerzz> considering this will be the last fifa you would think they would boost everything up to give us a good few months
[2023-01-06 19:23:01] <%+always_rainy98> went on for 5 mins, back to ***
[2023-01-06 19:23:03] <zurivymyval> Goood evening lads! How is everybody doing?
[2023-01-06 19:23:05] <Rubendran17> TOTY will be absolute garbage based on what we’ve seen previously
[2023-01-06 19:23:06] <+ernart> I have almost 200 packs. All 80+ guaranteed at least.  Jus save for toty. Hope you get one. If not don’t mater cuz game will start dying anyways lol
[2023-01-06 19:23:07] <%+liquerbumhol> call it centurions..just make the first 100 rated cards it's the last year of the partnership make the game bang
[2023-01-06 19:23:07] <%+jay_alaw92> Maybe cuz the game will die if people have already got that 99% team in like Jan feb time which is there fault anyway
[2023-01-06 19:23:07] <tomathertonbarnes> Trash pointless reskin of every other promo, just a new card design, no originality in ideas, only good promo are live cards which create hype for real life games  like fantasy fut and road to the etc. cards
[2023-01-06 19:23:08] <%$darwinswift> I’d like that Mahrez that’s it
[2023-01-06 19:23:09] <%+markcheesyy> still can't believe it's just a base icon pick.
[2023-01-06 19:23:09] <+MrCatuh> nothing you can do about it mate
[2023-01-06 19:23:09] <%+colbs821> I need a cb sbc
[2023-01-06 19:23:13] <here4rewards_> seems like just a filler promo before TOTY
[2023-01-06 19:23:14] <baby_yak21> damn packed trentt
[2023-01-06 19:23:17] <dcbeatbox> Got Arnold in 80+8
[2023-01-06 19:23:19] <Rubendran17> Just gonna do that Mahrez
[2023-01-06 19:23:19] <AbdulTarar> TOTY better be an insane promo
[2023-01-06 19:23:19] <+TacoCorpWHQ> Makes it easier to save packs for TOTY at least
[2023-01-06 19:23:23] <williamruss15> they hammer us with hero sbcs and icon sbcs ,at least give us cards that match the power curve
[2023-01-06 19:23:23] <%CrazyEskimoPenguin> What's the harm in making that Arnold 88 or 89, at least then anyone who likes him would give a damn about the card and actually be able to have fun with them, this though? It's like a week three objective card lmao
[2023-01-06 19:23:25] <+Fenity> I packed Jaoquin, the setup is cool at least
[2023-01-06 19:23:26] <%+bwfc_dan> got Trent but came out at back of pack
[2023-01-06 19:23:31] <%+Metcalfe11> @NepentheZ when you hover over the transfer bit in game... the billboards say they recieve 'static but permanent upgrades' what does that even mean?
[2023-01-06 19:23:31] <+TheWhatZone> Packed bastoni. Garbage
[2023-01-06 19:23:31] <%+Kieran96cfc> for people who dont want ads at 6pm, come in 5 minutes before 6pm and you wont get any
[2023-01-06 19:23:31] <%prlce89> Aren’t some of the upgrades to players less than what it would be if they had got the new inform upgrade?
[2023-01-06 19:23:32] <+jrossino> It’s almost like they’re trying to make people save packs for toty
[2023-01-06 19:23:32] <+mattogden> hover over the transfers tab nep and look at the text talking about centurions it mentions an upgrade
[2023-01-06 19:23:35] <%mbesh> I packed Rebic and it looked nice
[2023-01-06 19:23:35] <+MrCatuh> i come in early every stream jus to make sure i dont get ads and it works everytime, if i miss some of it i'll just watch the video anyway
[2023-01-06 19:23:36] <greg190987> got guillit from icon pick so I'll take that
[2023-01-06 19:23:36] <FaboForever> promo is OK at best. not sure who can get into my team tbh

[2023-01-06 19:23:37] <michaelmcallion73> would you consider playing FM instead/ as well as FIFA
[2023-01-06 19:23:41] <ibracadabra1501> Thought on Mahrez????
[2023-01-06 19:23:46] <%+ColeTrain3> not opening saved packs for this
[2023-01-06 19:23:47] <+BloodBucketz> card design looks awful when it's actually got a player on it LUL
[2023-01-06 19:23:50] <+comeonyougunners49> Evening nep mate
[2023-01-06 19:23:52] <+jrossino> @jacktwoodard00 baby isn’t good though
[2023-01-06 19:23:52] <%+kingofthekop> theres so many footballers in the world but every year the cards remain the same select few
[2023-01-06 19:23:54] <baileyrubs> I got Ronaldinho In icon PP
[2023-01-06 19:23:54] <+mikec134> just packed kimpembe from my rivals rewards untradable

[2023-01-06 19:23:55] <+connorlxmartin> u boys like how EA said the quiet part out loud with the mismatched face card stats vs in game stats
[2023-01-06 19:23:55] <Twiggo77> @greg190987 not quite as good as my linkeker
[2023-01-06 19:23:57] <%+fuglyscarecrow> still doing icon packs?
[2023-01-06 19:24:02] <%+IceColdLemonodd> I wouldn't mind opening my packs if they weren't all untradeable and I don't have any SBCs to throw fodder into
[2023-01-06 19:24:02] <besika94> i am using brave browser which is blockind all the adds
[2023-01-06 19:24:05] <N8_O> I'm a developer and although EA is flawed in many ways, the fact that they put out daily new content at all is impressive from a dev standpoint
[2023-01-06 19:24:06] <mozza2699> Sorry if its been asked boys but how do you get ledley king?
[2023-01-06 19:24:07] <korneelvw> How are they upgrading this cards, Kimpbembe base 83 and his card is a 87, Pellegrini is an 84 base and is now 86 they only boost the OP ingame cards and that's why this game is so dead
[2023-01-06 19:24:11] <flow_sensei> all promo players should have 80+ pace
[2023-01-06 19:24:14] <%+bigoggerzz> I gor desialy

[2023-01-06 19:24:17] <+snakeebtw> its ok for this promo to suck tbh EA have been doing good recently
[2023-01-06 19:24:17] <+bbking84> ben yedder 89 is cool. Neymar should have been a 93 so close to toty
[2023-01-06 19:24:19] <ljkiernan89> don't think am opening my 83 25s then
[2023-01-06 19:24:19] <%+aipengiow> got baggio

[2023-01-06 19:24:25] <+wilderness_kid> Nep, be the decision maker for me. Shall I open my packs including the 3x. 83+ ww
[2023-01-06 19:24:29] <baileyrubs> I got Ronaldinho In icon PP
[2023-01-06 19:24:30] <threewatchess> That icon pack is awful tho isn’t it ? Base icons now?
[2023-01-06 19:24:31] <affectedhare> They try tempt you with 3/4 cards to open packs but basically all the others are pointless/worthless.
[2023-01-06 19:24:34] <+mattogden> hover over transfer tab and read the text next to the centurions players nep
[2023-01-06 19:24:34] <tomathertonbarnes> Are the WW Tokens done, I need 1 more

[2023-01-06 19:24:39] <+5slefty> Since they’re all so cheap you should do a fut champs run with a full centurion team
[2023-01-06 19:24:40] <mozza2699> @twiggo77 fairs mate is he not on market cos of price range?

[2023-01-06 19:27:36] <%+Kieran96cfc> if they upgraded it would have said in the article about this promo
[2023-01-06 19:27:37] <%exclusive457> literally one pack and packed szczesny, never got a winter wildcard but now get this LUL

[2023-01-06 19:27:42] <+gabetheboyo28> If they just got upgrades based on goals scored/games played they would be perfect
[2023-01-06 19:27:45] <chxrlie227> puskas looks good tho

[2023-01-06 19:27:58] <rory1152> @stonedmikey Not even joking 😂 I barely play the game this year too
[2023-01-06 19:27:59] <kongkrum> what i feel most weird about is the grand card design and the grand centurion name, and it ends up so underwhelming
[2023-01-06 19:27:59] <%+Searly_14> Do you think the market would have been better if it wasn't shared between consoles?
[2023-01-06 19:28:00] <wibsweatzv2> YES SIR
[2023-01-06 19:28:04] <%+saaj003> @itsRamzilla it's a re-release, they've had it before and it was impossible to do. Looks like they haven't even bothered fixing it

[2023-01-06 19:28:51] <Barbopoulus> I'm just sad they refuse to provide special cards to non top 5 leagues. I mean, out of 16 players that came out there is not a single one outside of the UK/ES/FR/ITA/GER leagues.  Specially being trash anyway...

[2023-01-06 19:44:08] <futsharky> @declan_1577 who said that I was unsettled, anyway was such a stupid question

[2023-01-06 19:46:14] <%$XueniloM> @bullettoothtony420 It's a mistake on most of the cards the card face stats are incorrect.

[2023-01-06 19:46:48] <N8_O> That's why I don't do base icon picks cuz they're 100k+ and there are so many other better cards. it's rare to get an icon worth it

[2023-01-06 19:47:52] <%+saaj003> Needs to be at least Base or Mid PP for this stage in FIFA. Ideally no Base at all
[2023-01-06 19:47:56] <%tismad7> got 90 garrincha after I did jairzinho
[2023-01-06 19:47:58] <%+QwadBhoy> RIP

[2023-01-06 19:48:50] <N8_O> I'd say Roberto Carlos is a W

[2023-01-06 19:52:35] <%lpd1996> @n8_o honestly bro try him with both and pick whoever you like more, i think Ake could be good with him but he needs a strong defender next to him imo, he is just so quick he covers everything else
[2023-01-06 19:52:38] <%+koojababy10> I have 3 tokens left. 81x11 or Trippier??
