[2022-12-07 17:56:07] <@%^StreamElements>* We're now uploading daily on TikTok at https://www.tiktok.com/@diegosaurstwitch
[2022-12-07 17:56:20] <Thripzlol> @nogoodcharles ther is no update, its just the game
[2022-12-07 17:56:20] <+TheFugaP> Pretty crazy that every major game suffers form crashes
[2022-12-07 17:56:28] <nogoodcharles> @Thripzlol oh
[2022-12-07 17:56:34] <+TheFugaP> i stopped playing apex because of crashes
[2022-12-07 17:56:42] <nogoodcharles> i got confused cause it said "update available" and mine crashes when i dont update
[2022-12-07 17:57:06] <nogoodcharles> @TheFugaP apex makes my screen tear even on minimum settings yet i can play any other game 1440p max settings and be fine -___-
[2022-12-07 17:57:20] <nogoodcharles> its cause apex engine is soooo bad
[2022-12-07 17:57:24] <Thripzlol> @nogoodcharles its upgrade available not update
[2022-12-07 17:57:33] <+TheFugaP> yeah i suffered stuttering too

[2022-12-07 17:59:20] <iKillBofes> i love u, diego
[2022-12-07 17:59:28] <+TheFugaP> on the other hand, as a computer science student i wouldn't want to work on a video game, must be a nightmare of tangled code and misterious bugs
