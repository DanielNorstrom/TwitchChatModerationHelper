[2023-01-09 00:03:50] <%Skyfairer> @grubguts To explain pendulum  decks, it functions through using a number range which is on the cards to determine what cards you can special summon and use abilities based on that scale.

[2023-01-09 00:04:49] <nickjaquez26> Do you think a normal person could be someone who’s a fighter
[2023-01-09 00:04:50] <SwampertGuru> it's immune to ghost too
[2023-01-09 00:04:50] <Psudopod> yeah fighting is normal with training.

[2023-01-09 00:05:08] <+shamanflux12> @nickjaquez26 many normal types learn fighting type moves

[2023-01-09 00:05:15] <Kavris_Ragehoof> Sounds like the bird punched you.
[2023-01-09 00:05:19] <wawawaaaario> In pokemon battle, bird punches you
[2023-01-09 00:05:21] <+shamanflux12> case in point
[2023-01-09 00:05:26] <+Mario1080p> It just needed to be effective to Fairy-type to have a Triangle of Fighting, Fairy, and Normal.
[2023-01-09 00:05:32] <+Dozyderp> normal types have the advantage of very diverse move pools gnerally

[2023-01-09 00:05:41] <@%Dawnyan> oh
[2023-01-09 00:05:47] <@%Dawnyan> to make normal weak to something I guess
[2023-01-09 00:05:50] <@%Dawnyan> they're immune to ghost

[2023-01-09 00:05:53] <08Juan80> @limealicious They are also immune to ghost
[2023-01-09 00:05:55] <@%TheLawlDawg> If a type had no weaknesses that would be unbalanced
[2023-01-09 00:05:56] <!%Laimubot> But those are two wolves inside you there
[2023-01-09 00:05:58] <+miketastic_art> normal pokemon = domestic pets
[2023-01-09 00:06:03] <%Ultima_Weapon02> ye
[2023-01-09 00:06:05] <+miketastic_art> therefore, yes, my jujitsui works on my cat IRL
[2023-01-09 00:06:06] <Stonecreek_KC> Miraidon for the lulz?
[2023-01-09 00:06:07] <%aquaskull64> what, just leave a whole type with no weakness? not a good game balance design
[2023-01-09 00:06:12] <08Juan80> Normal/Ghost have 3 immunities, and one weakness
[2023-01-09 00:06:16] <%Ultima_Weapon02> their immune to eachother so you cant use normal on ghost too
[2023-01-09 00:06:18] <%Mortal_Quinn> Normal being strong against Fairy would've actually made logical sense too
[2023-01-09 00:06:20] <08Juan80> No
[2023-01-09 00:06:20] <Kavris_Ragehoof> I mean, Normal is actually a pretty good type, since only Rock and Steel resist it, and only Ghost is immune to it. It's neutral to everything else.
[2023-01-09 00:06:20] <GoatMutt> Clod Strife is the only girl on your team?

[2023-01-09 00:06:33] <Kavris_Ragehoof> You have to change miraidon to its battle form.
[2023-01-09 00:06:36] <%$Wazaap888> only in fight forme

[2023-01-09 00:06:57] <%dinnydanny777> Normal having the strongest moves in Explosion and Return made sense but with Return getting cut its a bit questionable

[2023-01-09 00:07:07] <Kavris_Ragehoof> Nope.,
[2023-01-09 00:07:09] <%Mylexsi> from a game design perspective, i guess they wanted to make sure everything had at least *some* weakness, else e.g. Normal-type tanks would be busted
[2023-01-09 00:07:10] <The_Hooded_Guru> No
[2023-01-09 00:07:11] <%+TMutantNinjaChurchill> It is a higher level

[2023-01-09 00:07:14] <@%TheLawlDawg> I thought it was higher level
[2023-01-09 00:07:14] <%kepheru446> it's higher elvel
[2023-01-09 00:07:17] <%Mortal_Quinn> it's 4 levels above by default though
[2023-01-09 00:07:17] <+MiSaBudou> you can catch it down there now
[2023-01-09 00:07:17] <%Baerwald> Well, he does start at level 72
[2023-01-09 00:07:19] <Koichiru> its bit higher level

[2023-01-09 00:07:49] <%Azurika_> imagine being the dev on crunch time that had to add that line
[2023-01-09 00:07:51] <@%TheLawlDawg> Yeah that's why you can catch the second Miraidon after beating the game, so you can trade it without losing mobility
[2023-01-09 00:07:51] <!%Laimubot> they sure don't, they look like middleschool chairs
[2023-01-09 00:07:51] <MrXstatik> a snorlax with no weaknesses would be the biggest nuisance
[2023-01-09 00:07:54] <%kepheru446> the other miraidon has higher IVs, higher level, and a beneficial nature compared to the player's miraidon
[2023-01-09 00:07:58] <%donn_is_me> there's a game freak employee who saw their chance and took it
[2023-01-09 00:07:58] <chikunz> every miraidon/koraidon that has been traided has killed someone
[2023-01-09 00:07:59] <%Ultima_Weapon02> no

[2023-01-09 00:21:39] <%a_wandering_spirit_> @Psudopod Same. I much preferred that since it meant any Pokemon could have a good stat, and nature mints were easy enough to come by so that variety was still possible.

[2023-01-09 00:23:22] <%+JC_pls> If they just cut the release frequency in half, these games would probably be some of the best games ever made

[2023-01-09 00:23:35] <@%Greygull> Honestly what they need to do if they keep wanting to do this release pace is have a two-team structure
[2023-01-09 00:23:39] <@%Greygull> Or even three-team
[2023-01-09 00:23:43] <!%Laimubot> the ark that's all of chat is the spider dichotomy
[2023-01-09 00:23:48] <%donn_is_me> @Greygull they… do.
[2023-01-09 00:23:52] <Triza9000> honestly they could have, they are retiring ash so they could just sync it with the new generation that will probly be mid this year
[2023-01-09 00:23:54] <%donn_is_me> 2 teams.
[2023-01-09 00:24:01] <%LinkyWink> 😉
[2023-01-09 00:24:01] <%kepheru446> something like the monster hutner strategy

[2023-01-09 00:25:00] <Mazzax_Manacry> And there were only three people on debugging. That doesn't seem like many, to me.
[2023-01-09 00:25:02] <$Steveluvsshinies> Then again, a Level 1 Shinx with Helping Hand and Intimidate can faint all it wants without impacting the timer.
[2023-01-09 00:25:02] <08Juan80> Yeah, it's not finantial
[2023-01-09 00:25:03] <%Skyfairer> It's the japanese work ethos at work meaning split teams and upsising will be a very slow change

[2023-01-09 00:25:05] <Narsci> i mean they have ed sheeran on the soundtrack??? they have money???

[2023-01-09 00:25:15] <%donn_is_me> @Limealicious honestly there are benefits to being a small studio, but that just means you have to take your time. which they don't

[2023-01-09 00:25:59] <%$peekas0> I don't think Gamefreak is the one paying Ed Sheeran, to be honest.
[2023-01-09 00:26:00] <$Steveluvsshinies> At least they apologized for it
[2023-01-09 00:26:02] <%donn_is_me> Correct.

[2023-01-09 00:26:11] <%CocoonMoon> Incompetent/greedy management is why this game is the way it is

[2023-01-09 00:26:19] <%Ultima_Weapon02> investor deadlines
[2023-01-09 00:26:23] <%+JC_pls> It's because shareholders and company owners want to see a certain level of revenue, and the current release schedule keeps them happy
[2023-01-09 00:26:25] <F00BAD00> I dont think Gamefreak is lazy, I do think The Pokemon Company is lazy
[2023-01-09 00:26:26] <%donn_is_me> chat, ill give you a bit of a redpill too: ed sheeran is a drop in the bucket compared to development and marketing costs
[2023-01-09 00:26:26] <nicogerusan> is not that is lazy is that they don't want to implement it because is already out
[2023-01-09 00:26:27] <%$JoJo0217> "graphics are the first thing made" - some dumbass once said
[2023-01-09 00:26:28] <!%Laimubot> does mashing b still work?
[2023-01-09 00:26:30] <Leud_De_Grace> Game freaked out
[2023-01-09 00:26:33] <DemonedAway> Nearly 100% of the time it's due to not enough good QA or just straight being rushed by higher ups. Usually the same thing.
[2023-01-09 00:26:37] <CocoonMoon> EVERYTHING that goes wrong in video game development is the fault of the executives
[2023-01-09 00:26:38] <08Juan80> They just like to throw the lazy word
[2023-01-09 00:26:38] <Leud_De_Grace> Dont think so @Laimubot
[2023-01-09 00:26:42] <walladmajnoon> its a combination of expectation and management

[2023-01-09 00:27:01] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> I think most people who decry a game's development as "lazy" really do not have any idea how game development actually works

[2023-01-09 00:27:38] <F00BAD00> i will say the things gamefreak employees have said themselves have not fostered a "not lazy" image
[2023-01-09 00:27:39] <Leud_De_Grace> I assume the higher ups were being shit as usual, so devs werent able to iron it out
[2023-01-09 00:27:40] <%a_wandering_spirit_> I'm still going to hope for an Octopath-style Pokemon game. 2D works best for the series IMO.

[2023-01-09 00:27:50] <%Zergling_exe> @hesh4err There is no anime thoug limesTHink
[2023-01-09 00:27:54] <%Mortal_Quinn> no switch pro is probably due to chip shortshe
[2023-01-09 00:27:56] <%Ultima_Weapon02> that sounds like bullshit
[2023-01-09 00:27:58] <DemonedAway> Unlikely.
[2023-01-09 00:27:59] <%donn_is_me> honestly its probably true
[2023-01-09 00:28:00] <%+SleepyCorpse_> The problem is that Pokémon as a franchise has about a million moving parts, so if Gamefreak higher ups decide it’s time to make a new Pokémon game then the anime merchandising etc etc all coordinate a new Pokémon release. So if the development of the game starts going south it’s not as easy as saying just delay it

[2023-01-09 00:49:13] <%Skyfairer> Is Haitch or Aitch correct? Image result for is it h or aitch In imitation of the French, the English name is commonly aitch, but this means the name does not contain the sound of the letter. Those who pronounce the word as haitch and spell it accordingly as haitch, are in a sense restoring its original purpose.
