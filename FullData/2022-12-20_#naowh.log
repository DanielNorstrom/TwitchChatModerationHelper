[2022-12-20 10:18:00] <%+tsyakaz> people arent dying to something being broken and needing fixed or nerfed. they just need to be more clean with their play and positioning.
[2022-12-20 10:18:13] <RedXIII> whats liquids best? I haven't been able to pay attention to this race that much. I've been busy as all hell
[2022-12-20 10:19:04] <%+tsyakaz> @redxiii they were able to kill all adds intermission phase and teleport back to boss, but died immediately after.
[2022-12-20 10:19:07] <+aangkimoddi> @RedXIII 64.6%? i think. both guilds are literally at the same %
[2022-12-20 10:19:08] <%+sonartv> my statement was that this fight will probably see more nerfs by the end of prog. especially given we haven't seen past first intermission which they aren't even close to doing both platforms currently. who knows rest of fight could be a joke. getting thru p1 quicker isn't always important or even good if they don't have cds up that they would otherwise have for example

[2022-12-20 10:34:18] <%+sonartv> when you think about how they have to do this with half the raid :)

[2022-12-20 10:39:42] <%+tsyakaz> @lusochampion Because theyre still dying phase 1, and the best way to practice is chain pulling attempts

[2022-12-20 10:40:01] <%Laptican> @tsyakaz Exactly this
[2022-12-20 10:40:42] <%Laptican> It would've make more sense if they needed gear for phase 3, but it just doesn't make sense for phase 1

[2022-12-20 12:58:38] <%+IMrWatson> Ahhh, sweet
[2022-12-20 12:58:38] <Santalama> what was the fix
[2022-12-20 12:58:48] [Notification] mehcast subscribed with Prime.
[2022-12-20 12:58:58] <%+IMrWatson> Flamesworn Herald‚Äôs Flame Shield now absorbs 55% of its health (was 70%). The initial cooldown time of Frostforged Zealot‚Äôs Shattering Shroud has been increased. Players that are immune to the effects of Hurricane Wing are also immune to the effects of Hurricane Winds. Fixed an issue where Discipline Priest Atonement was incorrectly being affected by both the damage increase and healing increase from the Focused Charge buff.
