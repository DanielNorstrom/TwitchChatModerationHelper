[2022-12-21 15:44:28] <%A2Zephyr> @skullzzzi okay well lucky you, but it's pretty obvious what happened. he started the game normal, the game progressed horribly, the frustration builds to a point of no return and they dc for immediate relief. it's so human.

[2022-12-21 15:49:40] <%EvilD34d> stupid question...but can you pop a snowman and then place a trap with trapper...when the snowman spawns again...if someone goes into the snowman...will they trigger the trap?

[2022-12-21 15:50:06] <%+bigbigtatas> I just had a bug where the killer kick the gen with blastmine and the last gen popped at the exact same time and the kill could still kick the gen and I could still work on it after the gates were powerd

[2022-12-21 15:50:28] <+BDice42> @EvilD34d i dont think so. I think the snowmen spawn in random locations
[2022-12-21 15:50:31] <PugnaciousPaladin> @EvilD34d Pretty sure they randomly generate every time so that seems unlikely to happen
[2022-12-21 15:50:39] <@%drunk_shooting_banana> @EvilD34d but you are not guaranteed the snowmen spawn in the same spot
[2022-12-21 15:50:40] <%eviedudette> @EvilD34d hm, interesting strat hensNotes  sadly don't know the answer
[2022-12-21 15:51:00] <%EvilD34d> @EvilD34d ahh i thought they respawn in the original location...if it's random then yeah it wont work haha
[2022-12-21 15:51:21] <%eviedudette> @bigbigtatas haha, I had that bug recently. I could still repair my gen too

[2022-12-21 16:26:32] <Trouserstealer> I'm bad at killer too so I feel the stress of it especially with swf
[2022-12-21 16:26:33] <HHendrixxxxx> yo hens hope you're good bro
[2022-12-21 16:26:35] <zippyzaean> NOT EVERYONE SWEATS THEIR LIFR ON dis game
[2022-12-21 16:26:38] <Smirloc> I kinda feel what @zippyzaean is saying though. When i'm wanting to really my full attention I play killer. When I want to just chill and play some games I play survivor :)

[2022-12-21 16:26:43] <%+magic_mat1> And RNG, sometimes you just get unlucky
[2022-12-21 16:26:44] <FortunateLis> otz is a content creator not sweaty pants gamer
[2022-12-21 16:26:47] <%ChemicalCranberry> what you can count on is that swf never leave a friend behind
[2022-12-21 16:26:51] <%zeenotix> @abyuka for real
[2022-12-21 16:26:52] <%ChemicalCranberry> and you can exploit it
[2022-12-21 16:26:56] <zippyzaean> you can't play nice as killer man
[2022-12-21 16:27:01] <%ARCANUMINQUISITOR> In those scenarios you usually want to play for memes and goofs or enjoyment and not focus on a result like 4k or 3k @zippyzaean
[2022-12-21 16:27:01] <+hibrrnate> I'm late but idk how anyone plays billy I cannot control his movement AT ALL
[2022-12-21 16:27:01] <zippyzaean> you have to tunnel and camp
[2022-12-21 16:27:01] <horror_vendetta> Hey Hens and Chat ✌️
[2022-12-21 16:27:03] <%ChemicalCranberry> you can play nice if you get better

[2022-12-21 16:27:12] <Jd_crash> @zippyzaean honestly i feel bad playing as killer, i dont like killing people :(
[2022-12-21 16:27:20] <zippyzaean> bruh
[2022-12-21 16:27:23] <Modus718> @zippyzaean you dont but I'd say you probably need some strong slowdown perks
[2022-12-21 16:27:25] <%Chief_Ohnay> @zippyzaean I mean, plenty of killers are sweating their life off. You're just going to have to accept that some games are going to be fun where you won't have sweaty survivors or killers, but others people are going to bet their life on getting a 4k or escaping
[2022-12-21 16:27:26] <@%evidentlyfishy> @horror_vendetta Hello! peepoHey
[2022-12-21 16:27:29] <Consumer_Of_Crayons> @zippyzaean survivor is so chilled in comparison

[2022-12-21 16:27:37] <celiaa_14> I used to be really stressed when playing killer, but now that I dont care how the survivors feel, i got over it

[2022-12-21 16:27:40] <Smirloc> @Hens333 I REALLY hate how offensively people use the term "Sweat" now. People need to know that just because someone is better than you does not mean they're trying at all LOL

[2022-12-21 16:28:01] <Dusk_XeX> hi @Hens333
[2022-12-21 16:28:06] <nexiliusprime> My last 10 games as killer I made ppl DC and just give up without any effort so I let them finish their gens and go out
[2022-12-21 16:28:14] <Modus718> yeah people have been using "tryhard" in games forever
[2022-12-21 16:28:15] <%mehlmaschine> @horror_vendetta I am doing good! How about you?
[2022-12-21 16:28:17] <zippyzaean> they act so good when they pre drop every pallet

[2022-12-21 16:28:21] <Smirloc> Oh it's 100% cope. It's saying "I would have beat you if I was trying, but I wasn't trying and you where"
[2022-12-21 16:28:21] <zippyzaean> the bastards
[2022-12-21 16:28:27] <%mehlmaschine> calm down dude
[2022-12-21 16:28:38] <%Chief_Ohnay> @zippyzaean maybe you should just go play another game and relax. You're getting caught in the tilt
[2022-12-21 16:28:44] <%ChemicalCranberry> bro zippy had one bad game and is going full joker mode

[2022-12-21 16:33:28] <Smirloc> @zippyzaean I truly feel like archives can be helpful to mental if you can focus on them. Like yeah, you wanna win, but if your archive is "Sacrifice 2 survivors" you can still walk away with a win just killing 2!

[2022-12-21 16:45:30] <$crackawhat> so what is the proper way to play against blight? everytime I see hens play blight with average addons, he always dominates

[2022-12-21 16:52:09] <%+Ellamin> It's a very high/low tech. Pull it off you look like a genius, fail and you look like an idiot
[2022-12-21 16:52:17] <+weaky_repz> you're just an aura reading chad on every killer huh hens
[2022-12-21 16:52:32] <%Chief_Ohnay> @Sudcicle no, I know. The survivor who brought Blood Pact also had For the People. But you lose any chance of using Blood Pact if you're the obsession

[2022-12-21 16:56:58] <+Kickin_Buttxxx> It’s hard to as well, considering some killers just have entirely different playstyles. Like set up killers like Trapper and Hag vs rush killers like Wesker and Blight
[2022-12-21 16:57:05] <MergosWetNurse> i swear whenever I run a build like this my scourge hook spawns are rly awful

[2022-12-21 17:13:35] <%Chief_Ohnay> @aedge_ and was the one who brought the map offering KEKW
[2022-12-21 17:13:39] <Modus718> she was prestige 4 tho
[2022-12-21 17:13:42] <Spookz_______> maybe shes just better who knows
[2022-12-21 17:13:44] <+weaky_repz> that mikaela just came out of the box
[2022-12-21 17:13:58] <+Kickin_Buttxxx> @aedge_ that build alone makes me think she was an older player who came back, no one really uses those any more
[2022-12-21 17:13:58] <+Maki_nCheese> she was prob trolling
[2022-12-21 17:13:59] <Consumer_Of_Crayons> Just dumb thats it
[2022-12-21 17:14:00] <%+BarelyLive> that mikaela probably had that play work for her so many times

[2022-12-21 17:14:07] <piglingxxx> miss clicked the button?
[2022-12-21 17:14:08] <%+BarelyLive> that she continues playing like it

[2022-12-21 17:14:39] <%semplarr> maybe she has doggophobia
[2022-12-21 17:14:39] <elias09368> I had a prestige 99 the other day that couldn´t loop and never looked behind. some people just play without ever improving
[2022-12-21 17:15:06] <D3cks96> @D3cks96 you dc in locker
[2022-12-21 17:15:17] <+grayspinthegamer> She was probably a swf with a good friend

[2022-12-21 17:15:27] <+Kickin_Buttxxx> Prestige doesn’t always equal skill, you can play one character forever and eventually P100 even if you’re not necessarily good at the game lol

[2022-12-21 17:15:32] <piglingxxx> Did they intend to vault something and press too early? I've done that before
[2022-12-21 17:15:40] <+PurfectMeow> Some if not most people you see aren't paying attention to be fair
[2022-12-21 17:15:40] <%+ssamtho> @elias09368 most likely not the main player on that account lol
[2022-12-21 17:15:42] <%+BarelyLive> she might have just heard the terror radius and without looking around jumped into the locker

[2022-12-21 17:16:23] <%+BarelyLive> mindgames for when you play against her next time she will juice
[2022-12-21 17:16:26] <%Chief_Ohnay> @elias09368 I had a prestige 21 Quentin a couple weeks ago with <100 hours on steam who had absolutely zero pallet poise but I could barely catch him in a straight line chase. Sometimes if the skill seems off, there's an obvious answer.
[2022-12-21 17:16:31] <sree_ram7> bleedPurple
[2022-12-21 17:16:34] <+Kickin_Buttxxx> She had a play in mind that was so big brain we couldn’t imagine it

[2022-12-21 17:31:35] <NotDrunky> I almost never get ads on twitch but idk why, don’t have sub / ad blockers and is same regardless of device, i think it might have something to do with my country or the fact that i browse things in ways to avoid trackers
[2022-12-21 17:31:54] <%ARCANUMINQUISITOR> I wonder why ever since the medkit meta became a thing there weren’t more plague players overall

[2022-12-21 17:32:01] <%Florime_> @NotDrunky more likely the first than the latter, lack of trackers just means you dont get personalized ads

[2022-12-21 18:16:27] <Bekkagrim> as a mordhau player, i was really looking forward to the knight.
[2022-12-21 18:16:33] <%juliacanda> earlier you were playing against knight and you wondered how the guard broke the pallet so fast, it's because carnifex can break pallets almost instantly & knight can walk through faster than endfury
[2022-12-21 18:16:34] <0redgold0> hes just not gun to play

[2022-12-21 18:17:14] <mrhunter_99> what if they give Knight guard placement like how Pinhead starts his chain?
[2022-12-21 18:17:31] <+Slinker81> This is the second time I've been called simple and basic :(
[2022-12-21 18:17:33] <%+Ellamin> I've had so many moments againts knight where i'm at a loop, he drops a guard and i'm like "Welp, guess I just die"
[2022-12-21 18:17:35] <%+Ellamin> It sucks
[2022-12-21 18:17:48] <Bekkagrim> i was using call to arms and map of the realm to try and predict where survivors were running mid chase and get a detection
