[2023-01-10 10:29:40] <%+RubyRose2077> Jak 2 and 3 are the most BS games i've ever played and it's sad because they have such cool Early 2000's edge but it's waisted on shitty AI and bad controls.

[2023-01-10 12:02:43] <@%+Sotenbori> which will probably only be good for trophies if you're playing the PS3 version

[2023-01-10 12:08:14] <%+RubyRose2077> @GabrielFranc0 im excited for that too
[2023-01-10 12:08:19] <@%+Sotenbori> Spongebob went down the drain after season 3- 4 was kinda okay, but 5 and later just straight up sucked
[2023-01-10 12:08:28] <%GabrielFranc0> @rubyrose2077 looks promising
[2023-01-10 12:08:40] <%+RubyRose2077> i love JRPGs so it's for me

[2023-01-10 12:09:19] <+lifesmusic_> @gabrielfranc0 I wanna play that, I just can‚Äôt pay $60 for a game. Lol. I recently bought the last game, looking forward to starting it!
[2023-01-10 12:09:20] <virtusxxv> Did you play Jedi Fallen Order?
[2023-01-10 12:09:22] <Synthwave____> I remember an episode where squidwards toenail got ripped out , it was unwatchable after that elaWeird
[2023-01-10 12:09:24] <%B00GE> so many people are losing it over that hogwarts game LUL they tried changing the steam tags to stuff like "villain protagonist" "genocide simulator" and stuff
[2023-01-10 12:09:27] <PStar_Luigi> same thing with rick and morty for me first 2 seasons were prime now its not as good
[2023-01-10 12:09:32] <%B00GE> makes it sound so much cooler that even I want to play it now lol
[2023-01-10 12:09:32] <@%+Sotenbori> It went from clever humor with just a tinge of good randomness mixed in, to constant screaming/crying and Spongebob/Patrick just being obnoxious babies about everything

[2023-01-10 13:14:27] <avalis> i played a lot of ps2 armored core games and loved it, but i recently played it again and couldnt get into it
[2023-01-10 13:14:30] <@%+Sotenbori> #3, the tried and true overall favorite of the series, has the most expansions of the series and is regarded as the overall best by many

[2023-01-10 13:15:18] <@%+Sotenbori> It's gonna be hard to play them without an emu or ordering them online, but that way is more expensive
[2023-01-10 13:15:21] <%OnikenUK> they all have horrible controls like L2 and R2 for look up and down or something

[2023-01-10 13:15:49] <%ReignFyre> retroYAY
[2023-01-10 13:15:52] <@%+Sotenbori> AC4 is where the biggest change came in, a lot more aerial and modern but also a really strong contender- moreso its expansion game, AC For Answer
[2023-01-10 13:16:19] <@%+Sotenbori> AC5 is a bit more grounded, don't think you'll like that one but you never know- it's always worth at least a look
[2023-01-10 13:16:27] <CiYann> what's that brown thing on your shoulder? I don't have my glasses...
[2023-01-10 13:16:55] <@%+Sotenbori> Armored Core For Answer is my personal favorite- fastest paced, and the most badass designs overall
[2023-01-10 13:17:08] <CiYann> Aaah
[2023-01-10 13:17:14] <%SurrealTiggi> Super curious to see what the reaction to AC6 will be. Will ppl be open-minded to it not being a Souls-like?
[2023-01-10 13:17:16] <@%+Sotenbori> Also very fun, good music score, and good sound design
[2023-01-10 13:17:24] <+SanctusDesolatio> The best thing about the Armored Core games is making your own mech and destroying other mechs with it.
[2023-01-10 13:17:27] <%gumplord108> are you gonna be going for the true ending?
[2023-01-10 13:17:30] <keybladeguy> will u play that conker bad fur day

[2023-01-10 13:23:48] <+solidpeyo> the tech was there, look at kindom hearts or FF X
[2023-01-10 13:23:50] <objectivebinary> I think they had to make multiple animation engines to ensure animations smoothly blended into one another
[2023-01-10 13:23:53] <avalis> ps2 era animation is pretty nice, so expressive
[2023-01-10 13:24:05] <+Rin_RPD> gosh this brings back memories
[2023-01-10 13:24:09] <objectivebinary> But yeah, animation and programming have always been Naughty Dog's aces

[2023-01-10 13:39:12] <+TiR0NiK> when u jump and press the kick button u can reach higher heights and also are longer in the air
