[2022-12-18 18:49:15] <%MishaMerina> I dont think its so much being scared....but like...as an adult the 'fear' you have is missing out on some cool eastr egg or unlock. especially in rpg games where you'll beat the game and then have a friend be like 'Hey man did you unlock this super cool summon?" (looking at you FFX)
[2022-12-18 18:49:18] <+canvaskat> I have been playing games and then I go on a hyperfixation spree of looking up every little thing about that game (Me currently with AI:Somnium FIles)

[2022-12-18 20:46:07] <%+Chaddingway> Hi chat, uncle Chad here. Perfection is a lie and is an artificial human concept that we created in order to constantly improve ourselves. We know that perfection is unattainable, because nothing is perfect, but even if something were to become perfect, achieving true perfection would be the worst possible outcome.
[2022-12-18 20:46:36] <%Keld__> @Chaddingway if perfection isnt real then why is chat so cute peepoShy
[2022-12-18 20:46:47] <%+RegiBrock> Nothing is perfect? Sir I'll have you know I popped out the womb perfect all the time forever
[2022-12-18 20:46:55] VIEWERS: 240
[2022-12-18 20:47:19] <%+RegiBrock> The trouble is that how do you define perfect
[2022-12-18 20:47:42] <%Fryden_> Striving for better is way more healthier than perfect
[2022-12-18 20:47:44] <%valfayr> exactly what stal said
[2022-12-18 20:47:47] <%+RegiBrock> Indeed
[2022-12-18 20:47:48] <%Cetonis> life more comfy when you stop expecting everyone to be a saint, just so long as they aren't demons
[2022-12-18 20:48:17] <%Keld__> Thats why I'm an asshole NODDERS
[2022-12-18 20:48:34] <%+RegiBrock> Damn Stal
[2022-12-18 20:48:34] <%+Chaddingway> When something is perfect, it stops there. You can't improve on it any further and you end up losing purpose, which is lame. Perfection also goes against the universal law of balance, and balance is what helps us define so many things in life.
[2022-12-18 20:48:45] <%+RegiBrock> You can't just come at a man's accuracy melds like that

[2022-12-18 21:15:30] <%Pillowyzeal> I don't know. All I know is the earlier you order the cheaper
[2022-12-18 21:15:32] <%Fryden_> THAT ONE IS REAL. I GET EMAILS ABOUT IT WHEN I USE GOOGLE FLIGHTS
[2022-12-18 21:15:51] <%valfayr> its the same that some thingys are more pricy if you do shopping with iphone
[2022-12-18 21:15:55] <%Frostearrific> I think it's right sometimes, bf has gotten better deals for no reason simply from the time he checks the tickets
[2022-12-18 21:15:57] <%valfayr> its tested and its real
[2022-12-18 21:16:06] <%Fryden_> Yeah like when I search for a place I wanna go to, if I search and don't buy a ticket, I get an email like 3 days later saying "hey, it's more expensive now"
[2022-12-18 21:16:09] <%AzuriAdore> you buy the tickets from your destination's country, i can confirm its ream

[2022-12-18 21:16:59] <%+sigmacw> the good old tried and trusted tactic is to book your flight tickets on the day of the flights

[2022-12-18 21:19:28] <%+sigmacw> airlines only really aim to sell enough tickets to at least cover the costs of the flight, so usually they would sell out the remaining tickets just before the flight
