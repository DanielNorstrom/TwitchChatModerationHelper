[2022-12-26 17:12:48] <%+BadCaTZzz> would you still build it vs a big ap team or rather have maw and triforce instead of shieldbow?
[2022-12-26 17:13:04] <Tofulous> Does crit apply on any of ezreal's abilities or nah?

[2022-12-26 17:13:31] <Npunkt> unexpected dmg why not
[2022-12-26 17:13:31] <%furrypandashit> too long cooldown Sadge
[2022-12-26 17:13:35] <YamiCorvus> on paper it seems cool, in practice its shit
[2022-12-26 17:13:37] <lunatiikk_> is kraken good instead of shieldbow against tanks ?
[2022-12-26 17:13:43] <+T3sando> I like woman¬ß
[2022-12-26 17:13:44] <BruNoCorreiA001> CD of galeforce is way too long
[2022-12-26 17:13:47] <%Aulyre> against a full squiscy team you could just go for prowler
[2022-12-26 17:13:50] <shraffy1> can we go this build on kogmaw

[2022-12-26 17:13:54] <g2forever69> are control wards worth buying early game ??
[2022-12-26 17:13:56] <Tofulous> Galeforce is only good on immobile ADCs for me
[2022-12-26 17:14:00] <+EasyBlin> it could work against certain teams i guess
[2022-12-26 17:14:16] <splinterwine> with the engage your team has an the skill shot of the enemies i thing gale is nice
[2022-12-26 17:14:17] <wojtaxux> @lunatiikk_ yes, you go kraken when you have tanks in enemy team
[2022-12-26 17:14:21] <nathanmorawe> against tanks is crit kraken or divine better?
[2022-12-26 17:14:21] <%BabyNevi> yes

[2022-12-26 17:14:29] <%darkyho> 2/8 LUL
[2022-12-26 17:14:32] <+TheMezze> Cooldown is too long for it to be consistently useful. You need to use the dash defensively most of the time it feels like, so while you could be creative with it, it‚Äôs just not up enough to be worth the risk
[2022-12-26 17:14:35] <p1vkoooo> banger
[2022-12-26 17:14:35] <%Aulyre> seemed unfair to say the least

[2022-12-26 17:14:57] <lennydrop2> yep
[2022-12-26 17:14:57] <toxic_zeyad> Sup have more chance to 1v1 than adc
[2022-12-26 17:15:01] <nathanmorawe> against tanks is crit kraken or divine better?

[2022-12-26 17:18:03] <%freakyashe> yes
[2022-12-26 17:18:04] <Forg0ttenTV> bruiser items are way too expensive
[2022-12-26 17:18:04] <protonhm> I just don‚Äôt like tanks passively force you to do like 5 things to deal damage to them by existing
[2022-12-26 17:18:06] <%Wildhardt> Yes
[2022-12-26 17:18:12] <lunatiikk_> @loserhimself  yes but now tanks one shot people who builds it, if its not bruisers

That is by far the hottest Cyber sportsman to ever grace the esports industry. I'd let him beast his way through my mid any day.

[2022-12-26 17:48:12] <+zakuja123> ego is saying youre the best, confidence is knowing yuor the best
[2022-12-26 17:48:14] <%+zestythelime> to hqve confidence means to also have ego knowing you'll be fine

[2022-12-26 17:48:17] <%+gjperes1> thats not ego, but a good amount of confidence
[2022-12-26 17:48:18] <%BlackMagicSpell> let's say that - there is good ego and toxic ego

[2022-12-26 17:48:21] <protonhm> Ego is thinking you can do something because you're simply better, so there‚Äôs no need to learn
[2022-12-26 17:48:24] <KebabImperator> Internet definition of ego is kinda distorted
[2022-12-26 17:48:24] <+Nandasattva> you can be confidsent and have an open mind yes
[2022-12-26 17:48:25] <%+FrostyPowerUp> thats not ego
[2022-12-26 17:48:28] <sanana_22> you need ego to be motivated to always do the right thing
[2022-12-26 17:48:32] <%+lorensj81> thats not ego
[2022-12-26 17:48:40] <jesaiah_> confidence is awareness of own capqbilities,ego is overestimating yourself
[2022-12-26 17:48:41] <Conkury> Just ask yourself what Jesus thinks about ego

[2022-12-26 17:49:40] <xoik_> Cookie, xayah and rakan can recall together. It is really difficult though
[2022-12-26 17:49:41] <%+FrostyPowerUp> overconfident without the skills or knowledge
[2022-12-26 17:49:49] <%+KawaiiCakex3> its ok to be confident, but being humble as well is really important imo
[2022-12-26 17:49:57] <%+Mikeler> i don't have a problem with players having ego it's just that in my experience most players that have it aren't just confident, they're also very toxic and borderline narcissistic
[2022-12-26 17:49:59] <%mozartora> this was a perfect zeri game
[2022-12-26 17:50:04] <%+zestythelime> but chat with having more experience and knowledge wpuldnt you be more egotistical?
[2022-12-26 17:50:05] <%+runningeryns> I think a lot of league players don‚Äôt have a teachable mindset unfortunately
[2022-12-26 17:50:07] <SoyFich> ego is overconfidence with or without the skills to do something
[2022-12-26 17:50:17] <mangfipws> hi cookie u going navori bulid?
[2022-12-26 17:50:19] <YamiCorvus> zeri gets popped so hard
[2022-12-26 17:50:24] <TaranillaGG> in my opinion having an ego is very good but keep it to yourself, for example in lol don't say anything in the chat.

[2022-12-26 17:51:14] <Tofulous> Miss fortune on draven can be somewhat good because of poke
[2022-12-26 17:51:17] <KebabImperator> Internet definition of ego is distorted. ego i what you identify yourself at and how you understand the reality. it can go bad in many different ways. but common internet definition is very simplified.
[2022-12-26 17:51:22] <SoyFich> Jinx works good against draven tho, if you didn't fuck up the lane

[2022-12-26 17:51:47] <not_faizan> i guess the goal against draven is just to not let him snowball
[2022-12-26 17:51:49] <protonhm> Is Draven just broken if you don't int stacks
[2022-12-26 17:51:49] <%+KawaiiCakex3> also a Draven educational game would be nice, i am absolutely PeepoNoob with this champ

[2022-12-26 20:09:13] <maydupnem777> The phrase ‚Äúit‚Äôs just a game‚Äù is such a weak mindset. You are ok with what happened, losing, imperfection of a craft. When you stop getting angry after losing, you‚Äôve lost twice. There‚Äôs always something to learn, and always room for improvement, never settle.
