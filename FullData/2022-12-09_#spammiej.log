[2022-12-09 14:20:28] <%$ThePlatypusOne> @cubenity "wichser" (pronounced like vixxa) would be something like "wanker" in english

[2022-12-09 15:44:44] <Ajemik> they only did this to make the skill gap less apparent, and preparing for console release so they aren't as "behind" when it comes to mechanics. Simplifying the game to appease to the masses

[2022-12-09 16:04:56] <@%^StreamElements> Back at it again with some 'Track of the Day' author hunting. Check out !medals to see the most difficult author medals in the campaign and my personal best on !midori - Before you ask, https://www.author-tracker.com uses a different medal for Midori compared to the ingame one. The goal is to just gather the available ones slow and steadily.
