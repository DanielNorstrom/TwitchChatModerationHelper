[2023-01-08 00:03:12] <!%DoogieMacGyver> every change twitch has made has just made it worse
[2023-01-08 00:03:25] <%Nite01> Sadge
[2023-01-08 00:03:32] <+Demokritos> It's largely because working in big tech can be miserable, as a programmer you often ruled by people who have no idea how the technology works
[2023-01-08 00:03:48] <!%Bisholio> that's how 90% of companies are too
[2023-01-08 00:03:48] <%Fransfabel> twitch what a dogshit is! but unironically
[2023-01-08 00:03:49] <+Demokritos> so you get asked for shitty features that have to be implemented in a shitty way
[2023-01-08 00:03:54] <!%Bisholio> they dont know shit

[2023-01-08 02:00:47] <%Svettgurkan> Heists are a single-player or multi-player mechanic introduced in the Heist league and can be performed using a Contract at The Rogue Harbour. The player must infiltrate the facility without raising alert, retrieve the guarded item, and escape with the contents alive. The target item will always be a single artifact that players may exchange with Faustus for Rogue's Markers , therefore Heist Contracts are an excellent means to generate Rogue's Markers. Cheer50

[2023-01-08 20:56:40] <@%Kuglorf> Since red is the color of blood, it has historically been associated with sacrifice, danger, and courage. Modern surveys in Europe and the United States show red is also the color most commonly associated with heat, activity, passion, sexuality, anger, love, and joy.

[2023-01-08 23:22:36] <%BodyBones> theyll just nerf the relics and keep them soul bound
[2023-01-08 23:23:05] <CipherJD> they might just give it the trialmaster treatment..unique map where you just fight lycia for the uniques
