Finally, when she's going to put the condom on with her mouth instead she quickly blows the condom up into a balloon dog.

[2023-01-08 12:10:15] <!JacerSaYGO> you can get it as a treat
[2023-01-08 12:10:21] <%$nicky_ray_> could save for more expensive upgrades and outfits

[2023-01-08 12:10:36] <DebiruBoi> the other sub-weps aren't as good imo
[2023-01-08 12:10:37] <%$jimmydadesq> polearm is good for dealing with b*lldo hoardes
[2023-01-08 12:10:37] <Weatherbee> only if you know how to do the polearm infinite
[2023-01-08 12:10:39] <%+Wasdniak> switching weapons is kinda clunky in this game
[2023-01-08 12:10:43] <TeethandHunger> I think so

[2023-01-08 12:10:48] <IronCrowe> Let’s just say, I never used it as my weapon of choice.
[2023-01-08 12:10:52] <%+Wasdniak> it's good though
[2023-01-08 12:10:58] <Spring_Lion> Kinda, but you decide, it’s mainly for combos and stuff
[2023-01-08 12:11:01] <%$jimmydadesq> at any time
[2023-01-08 12:11:01] <SkelebronzeUltraAlloy> once every 2 weeks

[2023-01-08 12:11:03] <!%+ajingus> uhh anytime technically I think
[2023-01-08 12:11:04] <!JacerSaYGO> you can access it mid mission
[2023-01-08 12:11:09] <%+aiguamol> once a year
[2023-01-08 12:11:10] <%+JakeRunner> the alternate weapons replace your heavy attacks
[2023-01-08 12:11:11] <!JacerSaYGO> but you have to restart
[2023-01-08 12:11:12] <%$jimmydadesq> you can access it from the codec call menu
[2023-01-08 12:11:16] <Spring_Lion> Sure through codec
[2023-01-08 12:11:20] <%+Wasdniak> any time, but it'll set you back to a checkpoint

[2023-01-08 12:26:29] <!JacerSaYGO> that move you just unlocked that the game never told you do do
[2023-01-08 12:26:29] <!%+ajingus> some attacks are unparriable so you need to dodge
[2023-01-08 12:26:32] <%$jimmydadesq> they always signal a grapple move with a flash of light.

[2023-01-08 12:37:05] <%$knightofcups777> if joker can get pregnant, men can have periods
[2023-01-08 12:37:06] <IronCrowe> But that isn’t related to abs though.
[2023-01-08 12:37:06] <%$nicky_ray_> mah boi
[2023-01-08 12:37:07] <Aestareth> the only reason its easier for men is because we don't need as low a body fat to get abs

[2023-01-08 12:38:45] <Cielwave> Nier is LENGTHY
[2023-01-08 12:38:46] <%Spidermayn_VT_LIVE> nier isnt a stream game

[2023-01-08 12:38:55] <%+JakeRunner> Nier is a very different experience
[2023-01-08 12:39:00] <domidomkk> i tried to play nier like 3 different times and just couldnt get into it
[2023-01-08 12:39:01] <%BLZbubs> i don't think nier is good content for mari
[2023-01-08 12:39:01] <!%+ajingus> its schizopilled
[2023-01-08 12:39:03] <%$nicky_ray_> i mainly like it for the music honestly
[2023-01-08 12:39:04] <IronCrowe> I see
[2023-01-08 12:39:06] <Aestareth> ever played ULTRAKILL ?
[2023-01-08 12:39:12] <Cielwave> I played Replicant on stream and it was a mistake, that shit was depressing and way too long
[2023-01-08 12:39:14] <Pavkaroth> it's also for many playthroughs
[2023-01-08 12:39:14] <%sora2025> what about death stranding the ultimate trucking game? marimariCORNDOG
[2023-01-08 12:39:17] <%PETTAN> Not a baby game
[2023-01-08 12:39:20] <%$Ezek__> its not that long, maybe 40 hours with all the extra content, idk what  just one playthrough would be like
[2023-01-08 12:39:23] <%$Ezek__> maybe 25
[2023-01-08 12:39:28] <!%+ajingus> this game is MG and a meme

[2023-01-08 12:39:45] <%+JakeRunner> This game is like "WOOOOO YEAH hinaboWooyeah FUCK YEAH WOOOO" And Nier is like "Oh man... hinaboInsane Oh... oh fuck... hinaboInsane aw shit man..."
[2023-01-08 12:39:46] <TeethandHunger> time for smash
