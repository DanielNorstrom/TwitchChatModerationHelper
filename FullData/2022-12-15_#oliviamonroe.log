[2022-12-15 16:58:43] Joining #oliviamonroe..
[2022-12-15 16:58:43] VIEWERS: 300
[2022-12-15 16:58:43] You have joined #oliviamonroe
[2022-12-15 16:58:45] <RoddySaysHello> Do you actually have to be supervised
[2022-12-15 16:58:48] <+Inimea> the CPU calculates the numbers
[2022-12-15 16:58:50] <Rarefoil> The CPU tells the GPU to turn numbers to pictures
[2022-12-15 16:58:52] <%Hentaiwatcher_> CPU is the computer brain, sorts out what happens and how it happens
[2022-12-15 16:59:01] <@%arcanumghost> gotta protect our girl olivia50Shock
[2022-12-15 16:59:04] <Temporal_Paradox> cpu is the math, GPU is the imagination
[2022-12-15 16:59:05] <!%Catbag> oh no
[2022-12-15 16:59:07] <%Sotetsu> I can make it on my own olivia50Oho
[2022-12-15 16:59:07] <!%Catbag> chat no please
[2022-12-15 16:59:10] <Heroes_of_Vale> I still remember, " RAM is like like a closet"
[2022-12-15 16:59:10] <AgentCobalt> oh no
[2022-12-15 16:59:10] <%madmat_pb_13> cpu is the manager?
[2022-12-15 16:59:11] <$Kusanagi2k5> I feel like Oli needs to save all her questions for one day a week, and have a classroom stream where chat teaches her things
[2022-12-15 16:59:11] <%+ElleandBooster> oh boy
[2022-12-15 16:59:13] <%Hentaiwatcher_> better CPU   better brain, faster PC
[2022-12-15 16:59:14] <%Nyandalos> Your brothers must constantly be facepalming watching your streams
[2022-12-15 16:59:15] <!%Catbag> trust me you're making it worse
[2022-12-15 16:59:19] <@%BlackCharcz> Can't be any worse, Oli. Shoot!
[2022-12-15 16:59:19] <$StrikingWalrus> so those simpsons huh?
[2022-12-15 16:59:20] <goj0_satoruu> oh boy
[2022-12-15 16:59:21] <%kenny_cross> chat trauma speedrun any%
[2022-12-15 16:59:22] <zeunknown> Olivia as a person lacks both a GPU and a CPU she's just powered by pure spite
[2022-12-15 16:59:24] <%StuckBoy> CPU is the instructor, like telling the GPU to do math to make pictures
[2022-12-15 16:59:26] <!%$rumbagthe> !so ElleandBooster
[2022-12-15 16:59:27] <%^StreamElements> Check out ElleandBooster at https://twitch.tv/elleandbooster playing Just Chatting! Show them some love!
[2022-12-15 16:59:28] <+JayBusch> How much worse could it be?
[2022-12-15 16:59:29] <%Hentaiwatcher_> olivia50Pat
[2022-12-15 16:59:33] <PowerhouseOfficial> Ah s*** here we go again
[2022-12-15 16:59:34] <%Leon27607> olivia50Shock
[2022-12-15 16:59:38] <%Sotetsu> Thank you, Booster
[2022-12-15 16:59:40] <spookgerook> But Liv, accredited Hollywood actor Terrence Howard has already disproven gravity
[2022-12-15 16:59:43] <Chicken_And_Blue_Waffles> In the age of dino, CPUs were using to make math and only that, then nerds decide to use to make other things and now we are here
[2022-12-15 16:59:44] <!%AirahsELL> ok so. since all computation runs on binary, it is entirely possible to play Skyrim with just a light switch.
[2022-12-15 16:59:44] <%Furudehan> But you're still looking for friends, right...? :(
[2022-12-15 16:59:45] <%Melnazar> I..have no idea what specs are. I probably would have shown my glasses
[2022-12-15 16:59:46] <%BlueHope77> Hello Olivia and Chat olivia50Heart olivia50Wave olivia50Pat
[2022-12-15 16:59:48] <Scorpi_Onion> LUL
[2022-12-15 16:59:52] <@%arcanumghost> good old @elleandbooster olivia50Heart
[2022-12-15 16:59:55] <+gacman47> lol in olis vtubers bio it talks about her time downloading three anti-virus programs. Yeah there it is
[2022-12-15 16:59:57] <%$coolxkappa> CPU is the brain, but the GPU is the part of the brain your eyes connect to. the cpu can work on its own but the GPU makes things look nicer
[2022-12-15 17:00:01] <%+Yggy_Ch> @zeunknown you had a typo. She's powered by pure SPIRIT
[2022-12-15 17:00:06] <%+hugu44> Olivia is also powered by free food from neighbour that thinks she is pregnananant
[2022-12-15 17:00:11] <!%spiritofgotham> Huh what
[2022-12-15 17:00:14] <%PigWithoutProtection> do you know what GPS is?
[2022-12-15 17:00:14] VIEWERS: 300
[2022-12-15 17:00:15] <%$Dakmoonshadow> She's has two fluffy drive attachments.
[2022-12-15 17:00:19] <%Furudehan> That is for the best. Stay off the grid.
[2022-12-15 17:00:22] <Chicken_And_Blue_Waffles> @coolxkappa wrong CPU can also render graphics :X
[2022-12-15 17:00:27] <%AlphaOmega82> well get Oli to take a course in Computer organization and architecture
[2022-12-15 17:00:27] <%Sotetsu> Okay, Shoji
[2022-12-15 17:00:30] <%Megaket> Your NEW neighbours think you're pregnant too?!
[2022-12-15 17:00:30] <%$coolxkappa> you have new neighbors now don't you? do they know youre pregnant yet?
[2022-12-15 17:00:30] <!%spiritofgotham> I almost thought you were talking to me 'cause other people call me Spirit lol
[2022-12-15 17:00:31] <!%Catbag> i'd perish
[2022-12-15 17:00:33] <!%AirahsELL> probs not

[2022-12-15 17:00:38] <%RabidBeefalo> no shot
[2022-12-15 17:00:39] <Heroes_of_Vale> I would adjust
[2022-12-15 17:00:39] <%$coolxkappa> @chicken_and_blue_waffles thats what I said
[2022-12-15 17:00:40] <DevTwoThousand> i hope u win the video game mikadoToucan
[2022-12-15 17:00:41] <Parasocial69> Hay, Olivia, if you didn't get much TV in your childhood home, what was the state of computers/internet then??
[2022-12-15 17:00:42] <%PigWithoutProtection> not sure, maybe?
[2022-12-15 17:00:44] <fire_from_space> Yes
[2022-12-15 17:00:45] <%Sotetsu> Yes olivia50Shock
[2022-12-15 17:00:45] <%+shibiririreruwa> What????
[2022-12-15 17:00:47] <zeunknown> If Olivia was a character in the Simpsons the joke would just be herself. She defies the laws of the world by existing alone. Even Homer's smarter than her
[2022-12-15 17:00:48] <%RabidBeefalo> yes
[2022-12-15 17:00:48] <Tursmo> Dont tell me you leave everything on desktop
[2022-12-15 17:00:48] <%Megaket> No, legs do that
[2022-12-15 17:00:49] <@%BlackCharcz> yes
[2022-12-15 17:00:49] <spookgerook> Yes
[2022-12-15 17:00:49] <Rarefoil> yeah
[2022-12-15 17:00:50] <%StuckBoy> No, it's to organize things for you
[2022-12-15 17:00:50] <%schelmischerWolf> oh no
[2022-12-15 17:00:50] <!%Catbag> ...like on the PC? DO YOU NOT USE FOLDERS?
[2022-12-15 17:00:50] <Temporal_Paradox> no
[2022-12-15 17:00:51] <+gacman47> not completely. But close to it by living in the woods
[2022-12-15 17:00:51] <reverend_mooch> Yes
[2022-12-15 17:00:52] <Chicken_And_Blue_Waffles> Only if you let me have some books :v
[2022-12-15 17:00:53] <%$coolxkappa> more folders = faster computer
[2022-12-15 17:00:55] <+Inimea> yes
[2022-12-15 17:00:55] <%AlphaOmega82> olivia50Load
[2022-12-15 17:00:55] <+JayBusch> Folders help you stay organized

[2022-12-15 17:00:57] <$Kusanagi2k5> I NOW FEAR FOR OLI’S DESKTOP
[2022-12-15 17:00:58] <DRAWING_DAEMON> actual nani
[2022-12-15 17:00:58] <RoddySaysHello> We're now answering two different questions at the same time
[2022-12-15 17:01:01] <$StrikingWalrus> does Oli save everything on desktop? PepeHands
[2022-12-15 17:01:01] <$JensenRabbit> Folders are just to visualize content for the user
[2022-12-15 17:01:02] <leo_coelho> Olivia spite could solve energy crisis, we we just get her angry enough...!
[2022-12-15 17:01:02] [Points] Sotetsu redeemed Suffering- Anakin Skywalker Sounds: Star Wars (2 500)
[2022-12-15 17:01:03] <!%Catbag> Olivia show us your desktop right now nemuGun
[2022-12-15 17:01:03] <%schelmischerWolf> yes folders are important
[2022-12-15 17:01:04] <fantasticbovine> folders help you keep things organized
[2022-12-15 17:01:04] <redmanticore> diablo 2 folder
[2022-12-15 17:01:04] <%Melnazar> Also... I'm afraid that I would have given my height for measurement. Translation issue
[2022-12-15 17:01:06] <rempac15> organization helps
[2022-12-15 17:01:08] <@%arcanumghost> you have to feed your computer a folder every day
[2022-12-15 17:01:08] <%kimilenne> no but it helps your brain run
[2022-12-15 17:01:08] <PowerhouseOfficial> Folders are meant for organization but there is folders that contain critical programs
[2022-12-15 17:01:09] <@%BlackCharcz> computer is just foolproof enough so it doesn't care if you DON'T use folders
[2022-12-15 17:01:09] <Nerava> Folders are just organization
[2022-12-15 17:01:09] <SteelRat0> It's BAD
[2022-12-15 17:01:10] <Temporal_Paradox> organization
[2022-12-15 17:01:10] <melly_is_besty> Me? maybe at some point, but i can't go off-grid now zentreNB
[2022-12-15 17:01:10] <!%Catbag> NOT THE RECYCLE BIN omochi2Dead
[2022-12-15 17:01:12] <Chicken_And_Blue_Waffles> @OliviaMonroe NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO NOT ONE BUCKET
[2022-12-15 17:01:13] <%ArcReaper_21> Folders are for organization. So you can see where everything is located.
[2022-12-15 17:01:13] <plumhood> Hello
[2022-12-15 17:01:13] <%+shibiririreruwa> KEKW OLI DID IT AGAIN
[2022-12-15 17:01:13] <@%Athagorn> Nah, folders are just for organization.
[2022-12-15 17:01:13] <!%AirahsELL> not really. they help organize things. in terms of running programs it lets the computer find things faster.
[2022-12-15 17:01:14] <%Furudehan> I'm not as organized with folders as I can be.
[2022-12-15 17:01:14] <zeunknown> WHY ARE YOU LIKE THIS
[2022-12-15 17:01:14] <%honey_badger2341> its organization

[2022-12-15 17:01:19] <@%DrGoodStrats> @arcanumghost KEKW
[2022-12-15 17:01:21] <%$coolxkappa> technically you don't need folders to run the pc, it could all be in one folder, its just not organized so no human could use it properly
[2022-12-15 17:01:22] <%honey_badger2341> the more organized it is the easier to read
[2022-12-15 17:01:22] <redmanticore> who remembers microsoft suitcase
[2022-12-15 17:01:27] <@%Athagorn> Help you find stuff, will not impact in processing power.

[2022-12-15 17:01:29] <fantasticbovine> do you also keep all your clothes in one pile
[2022-12-15 17:01:32] <Rarefoil> Does Oli's desktop look like Doc Oc's from Into the Spiderverse?
[2022-12-15 17:01:33] BITS: AFlatCap (100)
[2022-12-15 17:01:33] <$AFlatCap> Cheer100 Oh my god Becky, look at her eyes They’re so big She looks like one of those chat guys’ girlfriends Who understands those chat guys They only talk to her because she looks like a total Vtuber I mean her eyes They’re just so big I can't believe they’re so round They’re just out there I mean, it's gross Look, she's just so ANIME

[2022-12-15 17:01:37] <Temporal_Paradox> it's not really bad, but you should feel bad
[2022-12-15 17:01:37] <@%BlackCharcz> @redmanticore o/
[2022-12-15 17:01:40] <Parasocial69> Most people: folders.  Olivia: B U C K E T
[2022-12-15 17:01:44] <%Lillowh> Did you remember to water your electronics?
[2022-12-15 17:01:48] <%Furudehan> Hahaha
[2022-12-15 17:01:48] <uniquelywill> beeeeDed beeeeLeave beeeeLeave beeeeLeave beeeeLeave beeeeLeave beeeeLeave beeeeLeave
[2022-12-15 17:01:52] <SteelRat0> rule of thumb: up to 100 elements inside each folder
[2022-12-15 17:01:53] <RoddySaysHello> Your PC is not thirsty, it does not want orange juice
[2022-12-15 17:01:59] <SteelRat0> else, it takes a lot to search
[2022-12-15 17:02:03] <@%Athagorn> msclOmegalul
[2022-12-15 17:02:05] <%ArcReaper_21> Folders can help you track down issues, separate important stuff from person stuff
[2022-12-15 17:02:07] <plumhood> How are you doing?
[2022-12-15 17:02:09] <%honey_badger2341> also it can get faster if you download more ram
[2022-12-15 17:02:10] <SteelRat0> files

[2022-12-15 17:02:26] <Heroes_of_Vale> kkcyberOgey
[2022-12-15 17:02:26] <Rarefoil> What PC thing?
[2022-12-15 17:02:27] <%AlphaOmega82> your hard drives are full?
[2022-12-15 17:02:27] <melly_is_besty> zentreSuffer
[2022-12-15 17:02:28] <SteelRat0> element: 1 file or 1 folder
[2022-12-15 17:02:29] <!%AirahsELL> think of it like this: folders are like your dresser drawer. do you keep your tops and bottoms separated by color and season or shove everything into the same drawer and hope for the best when you need to find the perfect camisole?
[2022-12-15 17:02:29] <%$coolxkappa> your task manager storage is red?
[2022-12-15 17:02:29] <%Melnazar> Red is not good, except if it's a dress. Then it's awooga
[2022-12-15 17:02:30] <spookgerook> I don't know why they said element when the word file exists
[2022-12-15 17:02:30] <zeunknown> WE CAN'T EXPLAIN ELEMENTS TO HER

[2022-12-15 17:02:31] <$Kusanagi2k5> If you aren’t actually in an IT related field, please do not confuse her
[2022-12-15 17:02:32] <Chicken_And_Blue_Waffles> @OliviaMonroe red means you are running out of space and will chug
[2022-12-15 17:02:33] <Parasocial69> ??????

[2022-12-15 17:02:46] <%RabidBeefalo> File Explorer is full storages?
[2022-12-15 17:02:47] <%Lillowh> Like storage is nearly full?

[2022-12-15 17:02:55] <%PigWithoutProtection> a screenshot might give out a bit to much info
[2022-12-15 17:02:56] <%Hentaiwatcher_> "this pc" "disks and drives"

[2022-12-15 17:03:13] <%Melnazar> Your disk drive is too full!
[2022-12-15 17:03:13] <%Hentaiwatcher_> means you have a lot saved and not a lot of space left
[2022-12-15 17:03:15] <%Furudehan> I guess.
[2022-12-15 17:03:15] <!GoodishGames> that means you need more space to store stuff

[2022-12-15 17:03:26] <$JensenRabbit> you should remove some trash
[2022-12-15 17:03:26] <Chicken_And_Blue_Waffles> @OliviaMonroe NO, full means your pc will have problems
[2022-12-15 17:03:28] <zeunknown> Just delete stuff or optimize what little space you have

[2022-12-15 17:03:35] <SteelRat0> It will slow down your PC

[2022-12-15 17:03:38] <Chicken_And_Blue_Waffles> @OliviaMonroe try make it blue, delete things you dont use
[2022-12-15 17:03:41] <leo_coelho> I strongly feel that Olivia should only get computer help from her brothers, on the basis chat made her delete system32
[2022-12-15 17:03:41] <!%Catbag> what does it say under the red bar
[2022-12-15 17:03:42] <$StrikingWalrus> just delete old things
[2022-12-15 17:03:47] <Nerava> You want some empty space. Empty disk space gets used for things.

[2022-12-15 17:04:02] <%Hentaiwatcher_> like "10gb free of 50gb"
[2022-12-15 17:04:02] <spookgerook> Oh all this time I thought  Liv changed the notifications to Simpsons references when it was just the main menu of the game
[2022-12-15 17:04:05] <%AlphaOmega82> random access memory!
[2022-12-15 17:04:06] <%Furudehan> Ram is memory.

[2022-12-15 17:04:17] VIEWERS: 346
[2022-12-15 17:04:17] <Temporal_Paradox> you need to delete things you dont need or buy another harddrive
[2022-12-15 17:04:19] <YourOwnSun> ram is short term memory
[2022-12-15 17:04:19] <%PigWithoutProtection> RAM is a kind of goat

[2022-12-15 17:04:26] <Tursmo> Google download more ram
[2022-12-15 17:04:27] <%ArcReaper_21> RAM is running memory. You can see it in System.
[2022-12-15 17:04:28] <%Furudehan> More storage you either delete things on your current hard drives or add more hard drives.
[2022-12-15 17:04:30] <!GoodishGames> you could probably do with another SSD if everything is in red, if you absolutely CAN'T delete anything
[2022-12-15 17:04:31] <%Hentaiwatcher_> "mine is 16gb free of 231gb"

[2022-12-15 17:04:37] <%Grawne> At this point call an IT friend or family, else you want us peeking at your files
[2022-12-15 17:04:40] <Temporal_Paradox> RAM is different than storage. more RAM means you can do more at once
[2022-12-15 17:04:40] <%Hentaiwatcher_> yours should say how much out of how much free

[2022-12-15 17:06:13] <!GoodishGames> in all honesty, your storage is probably filled. I'd check if you can either add more storage space, upgrade your current storage, or a combo of the two

[2022-12-15 17:07:21] <%Melnazar> You will eventually need to delete some things on your computer. Example : Older videos of stream you won't be using anymore.

[2022-12-15 17:07:31] <+ToastyBunzUwU> have you tried changing the light bulb?
[2022-12-15 17:07:31] <%+Yggy_Ch> You need to install more space
[2022-12-15 17:07:33] <SteelRat0> Buy another SSD
[2022-12-15 17:07:34] <%Hentaiwatcher_> you have to buy a new hard drive or delete stuff
[2022-12-15 17:07:35] <+JayBusch> You buy more hard drives or delete stuff
[2022-12-15 17:07:35] <%Furudehan> Empty your recycle bin.
[2022-12-15 17:07:37] <Fryman80s> Uninstall some stuff
[2022-12-15 17:07:38] <%ArcReaper_21> To find more space, you will probably delete some old stuff.
[2022-12-15 17:07:42] <%StuckBoy> Buy another HDD or SSD
[2022-12-15 17:07:42] <+game_master_rukia> uninstall games you aren't playing
[2022-12-15 17:07:45] <rempac15> either add another hard drive or consider removing old unneeded files
[2022-12-15 17:07:45] <uniquelywill> michel87Splat LUL meanwhile Barney from The Simpsons with a cameo
[2022-12-15 17:07:45] <$Kusanagi2k5> We don’t let our trash pile up in the corner of the house, do we?
[2022-12-15 17:07:48] <goldenchuchu> probably uninstall some large games
[2022-12-15 17:07:50] <%Lillowh> Thats fine, just cluttered
[2022-12-15 17:07:51] <Nerava> You delete stuff to make space. Uninstalling games you don't play is usually an easy way.
[2022-12-15 17:07:51] <+ToastyBunzUwU> download more RAM
[2022-12-15 17:07:54] <Temporal_Paradox> you delete files, recycling bin and empty it. you can buy another hard drive too
[2022-12-15 17:07:59] <%+Yggy_Ch> sure yeah like that
[2022-12-15 17:07:59] <Rarefoil> yeah
[2022-12-15 17:07:59] <rempac15> yeah same premise
[2022-12-15 17:07:59] <%RabidBeefalo> yes exactly
[2022-12-15 17:08:00] <%Hentaiwatcher_> imagine your drive as a closet,  and the gb is how many dresses you can put in, and how many are in there at the moment
[2022-12-15 17:08:00] <zeunknown> Yeah basically do that
[2022-12-15 17:08:01] <Chicken_And_Blue_Waffles> @OliviaMonroe the Hard drive is like your room and currently is full of boxes, you need to throw things to the bin
[2022-12-15 17:08:01] <redactedorbit> yeah like that
[2022-12-15 17:08:01] <Fryman80s> Yes! Uninstall some old games and that will free up space for new games
[2022-12-15 17:08:02] <Heroes_of_Vale> You can clear out the closet or build an expansion
[2022-12-15 17:08:03] <SteelRat0> yeah, donate
[2022-12-15 17:08:03] <!%AirahsELL> you can just buy a new hard drive or solid state drive.
[2022-12-15 17:08:04] <melly_is_besty> Delete games that ya don't play zentreNB
[2022-12-15 17:08:04] <%+shibiririreruwa> More or less
[2022-12-15 17:08:06] <%Lillowh> Exactly like that
[2022-12-15 17:08:12] <leo_coelho> Meme donations
[2022-12-15 17:08:13] <+JayBusch> Donate the memes
[2022-12-15 17:08:14] <fantasticbovine> of course, a clothing analogy
[2022-12-15 17:08:14] <zeunknown> Or you can just buy an external hard drive which is easier to be honest
[2022-12-15 17:08:15] <%Megaket> That's more personal information than your available GBs LUL
[2022-12-15 17:08:19] <!GoodishGames> to find more space, delete stuff, get an external hard drive, get a new SSD for your PC by either replacing what you have or add to what you have
[2022-12-15 17:08:19] <%ArcReaper_21> Or you can use an External Hard Drive
[2022-12-15 17:08:22] <$JensenRabbit> you can probably get some drive space by using Disk Cleanup

[2022-12-15 17:08:23] <%AlphaOmega82> watching Oli is a real cultural exchange
[2022-12-15 17:08:24] <%+Yggy_Ch> depends on how big it is
[2022-12-15 17:08:24] <%Hentaiwatcher_> you can buy a new drive yes
[2022-12-15 17:08:24] <%Sotetsu> Oh my god, Oli is Jen from "The IT Crowd"
[2022-12-15 17:08:24] <%StuckBoy> Depends on how much space you want
[2022-12-15 17:08:26] <!%AirahsELL> you can clear out your closet or buy a new dresser
[2022-12-15 17:08:27] <rempac15> less than $100 mostly
[2022-12-15 17:08:27] <%Tylphen> memes are valuable in this economy; hold them forever
[2022-12-15 17:08:29] <%Hentaiwatcher_> or get a usb drive to plug in
[2022-12-15 17:08:29] <reverend_mooch> More than a car battery
[2022-12-15 17:08:30] <@%arcanumghost> I have a program I like for finding stuff to delete: wiztree. I'll put some pics in media share
[2022-12-15 17:08:31] <+JayBusch> Depends on the size of hard drive
[2022-12-15 17:08:33] <%PigWithoutProtection> expansion means going to the store and buy extra physical stuff
[2022-12-15 17:08:34] <%GlueeEater> KEKW
[2022-12-15 17:08:36] <hotdough> buy space brick and plug it in

[2022-12-15 17:08:37] <%RabidBeefalo> $50-$150
[2022-12-15 17:08:39] <%Hentaiwatcher_> usb storage drive
[2022-12-15 17:08:40] <+ToastyBunzUwU> download more RAM
[2022-12-15 17:08:40] <Temporal_Paradox> uninstall old games. you can redownload them if you want to play later
[2022-12-15 17:08:42] <%Megaket> How? Oli do you know what a USB memory stick is???
[2022-12-15 17:08:43] <zeunknown> HOW DO YOU NOT KNOW YOU CAN BUY EXTERNAL HARD DRIVES... WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN LIVING THIS WHOLE TIME IT'S 2022
[2022-12-15 17:08:46] <!GoodishGames> do you know if you have more storage spaces available?
[2022-12-15 17:08:47] <+JayBusch> Please get your brothers in there if you buy another hard drive
[2022-12-15 17:08:52] <%kirby23590> the8bitXD pfffft
[2022-12-15 17:08:52] <+toshimiwa> everyday learning something new zentreHmm
[2022-12-15 17:08:53] <PowerhouseOfficial> Okay actual serious advice: you need to find a program on your computer called disk cleanup run that it will delete the unnecessary files however keep the important files on your computer and it won't touch your personal files documents photos videos Etc
[2022-12-15 17:08:55] <+basking2> lol, starfire
[2022-12-15 17:08:55] <%Nyandalos> Uninstall some games you're done with.
[2022-12-15 17:08:58] <SteelRat0> an additional SSD cost like 50$, that's not expensive
[2022-12-15 17:09:01] <ArrrrWastaken> Donate your old clothes to the Underprivileged Valley Girl foundation
[2022-12-15 17:09:08] <leo_coelho> Olivia, ask your brothers about CC cleaner and about reseting your pc from time to time so you can free RAM without destroying your pc
[2022-12-15 17:09:11] <+oops_all_imaginary> CCleaner helps too
[2022-12-15 17:09:24] <Chicken_And_Blue_Waffles> @oops_all_imaginary NOOO CCleaner is malware these days
[2022-12-15 17:09:25] <PowerhouseOfficial> No CC clean up is actually terrible nowadays
[2022-12-15 17:09:29] <%PigWithoutProtection> PowerhouseOfficial has a good idea. Maybe dont do it WHILE STREAMING though
[2022-12-15 17:09:31] <%Furudehan> Even those are gonna be too complicated.
[2022-12-15 17:09:32] <%Hentaiwatcher_> ccleaner is good,   but yes i'd ask your brothers to talk you though it
[2022-12-15 17:09:32] <+oops_all_imaginary> @chicken_and_blue_waffles oh is it?
[2022-12-15 17:09:33] <PowerhouseOfficial> And she would probably install the extensions that come with it no avoid that
[2022-12-15 17:09:34] <Chicken_And_Blue_Waffles> NONONONO CCleaner is bad these daus
[2022-12-15 17:09:35] <%Megaket> Disk is spelled like that, disk is a separate thing from a disc!
[2022-12-15 17:09:35] <%TalkingObject> do you have a hdd or sdd?
[2022-12-15 17:09:36] <Chicken_And_Blue_Waffles> days*
[2022-12-15 17:09:37] <Temporal_Paradox> you don't need ccleaner
[2022-12-15 17:09:41] <!%AirahsELL> a 3TB external hard drive is probably a hundred dollars? same price as a 1TB solid state drive. you just connect it to a USB port and can move things there or even install games there.
[2022-12-15 17:09:42] <%devriestron> yeah CCleaner isn't worth it, it just wants to install ad programs
[2022-12-15 17:09:44] <Sabian42> all mobile cleaners are a scam
[2022-12-15 17:09:44] <+game_master_rukia> ccleaner does nothing helpful
[2022-12-15 17:09:45] <Chicken_And_Blue_Waffles> @OliviaMonroe CCleaner was good but they devs made it worse
[2022-12-15 17:09:47] <+JayBusch> CCleaner is bad these days.
[2022-12-15 17:09:47] <hotdough> out of space? just buy a new pc
[2022-12-15 17:09:49] <%RabidBeefalo> sounds fun
[2022-12-15 17:09:50] <redmanticore> @PowerhouseOfficial she wont notice any difference even after cleaning up tho
[2022-12-15 17:09:51] <SteelRat0> CCleaner is no longer useful these days
[2022-12-15 17:09:51] <Temporal_Paradox> you don't need any programs
[2022-12-15 17:09:54] <+oops_all_imaginary> how CCleaner has fallen :(
[2022-12-15 17:09:55] <%AlphaOmega82> great idea
[2022-12-15 17:09:56] <%kenny_cross> find a 1 petabyte solid disk, you won't run out of space untili next month
[2022-12-15 17:09:59] <%gary_man_man> oh man
[2022-12-15 17:10:03] <fantasticbovine> @PowerhouseOfficial didn't it have a virus in it some time ago even?
[2022-12-15 17:10:04] <@%Athagorn> @Sabian42 Word...
[2022-12-15 17:10:05] <ChibiDeviChaosCH> Oh god monkaS
[2022-12-15 17:10:06] <%Hentaiwatcher_> you know you cough downloaded the legit copy of this game cough
[2022-12-15 17:10:09] <%ArcReaper_21> You can also get some extra storage space with an External Hard Drive
[2022-12-15 17:10:09] <SteelRat0> you gonna bust all the parts
[2022-12-15 17:10:10] <%Furudehan> Handcam could be fun.
[2022-12-15 17:10:14] <uniquelywill> kalani2Snack michel87Rave i support that idea, Olivia. i say Go For it
[2022-12-15 17:10:17] <%Hentaiwatcher_> that had a file size,  and that is now being taken up on your hard drive
[2022-12-15 17:10:18] <!GoodishGames> yeah, talk with your brothers, but know that you can get an external harddrive or add to what you have, should you have open places
[2022-12-15 17:10:18] <reverend_mooch> Would still talk just as much KEKW

[2022-12-15 17:10:23] <!%AirahsELL> TreeSize is fine. it doesnt clean anything up but it organizes stuff so you can delete stuff yourself
[2022-12-15 17:10:31] <Temporal_Paradox> just delete things, uninstall stuff you don't need. buy another hard drive I'd you need more space
[2022-12-15 17:10:31] <%+shibiririreruwa> KEKW One hour in and he still hasn't started the game
[2022-12-15 17:10:31] <SteelRat0> we would all mald
[2022-12-15 17:10:34] <zeunknown> We're telling you to just buy an external hard drive or delete files that you no longer use. Don't buy any of those online programs that promise to clean your computer most of them are scams anyways at this point
[2022-12-15 17:10:34] <Temporal_Paradox> if*
[2022-12-15 17:10:36] <$Kusanagi2k5> Whoever talked you through getting this game to work, needs to do your IT work from now on
[2022-12-15 17:10:36] <%Lillowh> KEKW That stream would be incredible. People would die

[2022-12-15 17:11:05] <+game_master_rukia> after stream go into the windows settings and uninstall games you don't play anymore
[2022-12-15 17:11:07] <Nerava> You're probably fine just uninstalling some games you don't play anymore. You don't need to get extra stuff or run command prompt unless the computer is dying.
[2022-12-15 17:11:08] <!%AirahsELL> OH YEAH OLI DELETE YOUR RAW RECORDINGS

[2022-12-15 17:11:40] <+game_master_rukia> it frees up tons of space
[2022-12-15 17:11:42] <Fryman80s> So will the game actually not run?
[2022-12-15 17:11:43] <Heroes_of_Vale> Especially nowadays.  So big.

[2022-12-15 17:27:34] <%Furudehan> I'd like having someone interested in me who enjoys the same hobbies.

[2022-12-15 17:29:47] <!%AirahsELL> the reason that happens is because someone at some point in our lives told us that our passions are stupid and boring, usually someone we trust. thats how it is for me, anyway. i hate talking about myself for fear of boring someone or weirding someone out.

[2022-12-15 18:32:12] <%$coolxkappa> its more stable and easier to save state than use the in-game saving for emulators, I make often and multiple saves just in case it crashes

[2022-12-15 19:59:31] <!%AirahsELL> technically the pedalbike spaceship is the only car Bart drives. whenever you steal a car, unless it' parked, they're the one driving you. this is the same for all characters and stored cars. like Homer will always drive the family sedan no matter what level you're on.
