[2022-12-20 08:49:49] <%LordOverflow> I think it's better to use concept art on thumbnail when available. It gives more character to it but at same time leave viewer wonder how the game itself looks like
[2022-12-20 08:50:19] <%LordOverflow> At least for RPG games
[2022-12-20 08:50:47] <%vkphoenixfr> agreed @LordOverflow it's like games i got on my old amstrad cpc 6128, with nice graphics on the box, and then, once on my computer....aargh

[2022-12-20 10:41:30] VIEWERS: 533
[2022-12-20 10:43:05] <%Grim08a> So I have had this issue that at the start of the lobby when I jump out of the plane I would after 2-3 seconds get a complete freeze of the game that lasts for somewhere between 10-30(!) seconds. Which forced me to either enable auto chute or deploy my chute right as I jumped out of the plane. Now obviously that chalks basically all of my landings which sucked big time.      Turns out that enabling weapon motion blur fixed this issue completely.

[2022-12-20 10:44:04] <Faceplanter> @Grim08a  but now you have weapon motion blur DansGame
[2022-12-20 10:44:59] <%Grim08a> @Faceplanter Yeah well I will take that over having a 30 second freeze at the start of every game any day of the week :D
[2022-12-20 10:45:12] <%Grim08a> Yeah that is probably one of the more weirder fixes for a issue I ever had :D

[2022-12-20 11:25:27] <%Grim08a> @KayleighDHB lol you should have seen them mixing the drink basically half the glass was Fireball. It would have probably been better if they maybe went a bit slower on the Fireball and not half the glass ;)

[2022-12-20 12:39:10] <Sergant_Pask> Hi @P4wnyhof and Chat! I have a question - do you reckon a 3080 with I5 13th gen should hold at least 100fps at 1440p in Warzone 2?
[2022-12-20 12:39:39] <Optimmuss> @Sergant_Pask  - i got 3070ti with i5 12600k and playing on 130fps in 1440p
[2022-12-20 12:39:46] <candycorn93> I got a 3070 with i9 10900F works alright at 1080p

[2022-12-20 12:40:45] <Sergant_Pask> But is it due to bad optimization or is 3080 just not that good? I thought it was considered pretty good... @P4wnyhof @Optimmuss
