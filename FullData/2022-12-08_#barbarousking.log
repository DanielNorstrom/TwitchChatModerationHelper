[2022-12-08 01:13:56] <%CarbonAxiom> @re_d_ragon11111 Yeah, I highly recomment it, and it's honestly not as hard as it's made out to be. Just use summons and be patient, and explore around if you can't beat a boss. It's a more relaxing play than you'd think

[2022-12-08 01:21:35] <%slepinir7> We had a family of 5 come into the hospital not long ago for rabies shots because a wild racoon had apparently bit all 5.
[2022-12-08 01:21:37] <%Moonkues> aren't the rabies shots all in the stomach or something?

[2022-12-08 04:31:02] <%$reservoir_dawgs> @atchanzui elden ring barely has a story. It’s still better than Ragnarok story, but that doesn’t make it good
[2022-12-08 04:31:07] <+spicynun> @carbonaxiom honestly the best parts of a lot of fromsoft games are the DLC. I mean artorias of the abyss, old hunters, and ringed city come on
[2022-12-08 04:31:08] <Scones12345> Kratos, throw your axe at that.
[2022-12-08 04:31:08] <%DoctorBlowfly> It'll pass
[2022-12-08 04:31:08] <%+jamescid> but it will pass
[2022-12-08 04:31:13] <%+fickleconstant> I "beat" elden ring with my friend who helped me with co-op against most bosses and while it wasn't 100% me, it was one of the most fun games I've played in years

[2022-12-08 04:31:15] <%+Pressors> Kratos it’ll pass

[2022-12-08 04:31:24] <bergmeister_again> subnautica approach: read\
[2022-12-08 04:31:27] <%+StandingYon> the GOW NPCs with one voice line for it made it super annoying

[2022-12-08 04:31:27] <Zaph0dd> Kratos, your covered in Aloy

[2022-12-08 04:31:28] <%+zokered> Horizon Zero Dawn with Forbidden West  inventory system would have been near perfect
[2022-12-08 04:31:29] <%CarbonAxiom> @spicynun Agreed, I can't wait for the DLC for this. Hopefully its announced tomorrow
[2022-12-08 04:31:31] <teamLNCHBX> good ol atreus
[2022-12-08 04:31:32] <%+PatrickoftheIsles> Maybe there should be more cutscenes displaying in the environment as you play

[2022-12-08 04:31:34] <shiny_dubwool> The worst part is the "watch outbehind you Kratos" stuff is only necessary because of the shitty camera placement
[2022-12-08 04:31:35] <+carrwreq> biomutant had an external narrarator and it wasn't that great
[2022-12-08 04:31:36] <%$KingJayEagle> It's a more annoying Navi

[2022-12-08 04:31:45] <%Spirilicious> the next step for video games is playing the helper character that never shuts up while the hero is played by AI
[2022-12-08 04:31:45] <conawaytwitty> What’s barb’s most favorite game all time?
[2022-12-08 04:31:46] <+Gutterbean> the hand-holding has gotten...out of hand.
[2022-12-08 04:31:51] <%$KingJayEagle> I hate when games do that
[2022-12-08 04:31:52] <%Megatton3000> You could turn that off though in the options right?
[2022-12-08 04:31:54] <%gearhound99> hey did you know that you're ON FIRE BRUH for real
[2022-12-08 04:31:56] <%+Trip473> BROTHER! Youre covered in purple! My favorite color!
[2022-12-08 04:31:57] <%+kicksent> exactly
[2022-12-08 04:31:58] <599_USD> thats why elden ring and breath of the wild are so fun, they let you play
[2022-12-08 04:31:58] <%+wretchedundead> just your ego
[2022-12-08 04:31:59] <Parlie_Charker> it's not that they want it, it is that they need it

[2022-12-08 04:32:01] <%$Xel562> they should give you an option to activate or disable them
[2022-12-08 04:32:01] <%$NicoDosManos> there should be an option: don't insult my intelligence

[2022-12-08 04:32:07] <%CarbonAxiom> @Megatton3000 In Ragnarok? You can't
[2022-12-08 04:32:13] <%CoffeeBreathingDragon> you turn off the audio
[2022-12-08 04:32:15] <%CoffeeBreathingDragon> barbToxic
[2022-12-08 04:32:22] <stuckthread> Shadow of the Colossus told a very good story with very few words
[2022-12-08 04:32:27] <+itsmorzon> It's a fine line between telling a strong cohesive linear story and just holding my hand the whole way
[2022-12-08 04:32:30] <%Kilram> I agree. Soft guidance is the best approach. I hate the backseat garbo
[2022-12-08 04:32:36] <%gearhound99> I didn't know that lol
[2022-12-08 04:32:40] <%A_Benjineer> I appreciate games that let me figure it out and go at my own pace.
[2022-12-08 04:32:40] <%+enxxer> Right - I would want all games to have a disable helpful comments feature
[2022-12-08 04:32:45] <%$KingJayEagle> If you could only turn that off. It would be so much better.
[2022-12-08 04:32:47] <%Megatton3000> Got it, I just kept seeing people say it was an option
[2022-12-08 04:32:47] <schmitty9800> @Thersnofork some people make large conclusions about all of gaming from the AAA titles that UBI/EA/Activision are currently working on
[2022-12-08 04:32:52] <%MiloticMaster2> sucks there's no option to turn off the helping
[2022-12-08 04:32:54] <599_USD> even fallen order was pretty hands off
[2022-12-08 04:32:55] <%+SaltedOil> A lot of major AAA releases are like Marvel movies. Made for the masses, fun to consume but aren’t that deep
[2022-12-08 04:32:59] <%$Toadv1ne> OoT handled hints the best. You could use it if you wanted.
[2022-12-08 04:33:00] <%$Definitely_Alive> do you think we're getting norman reedus with a fetus 2: the walking simulator -- amazon harder at tga tomorrow?
[2022-12-08 04:33:00] <%$gumnas> I was going to say I miss Angrboda, but I couldn’t even remember her name and had to Google it. as a joke

[2022-12-08 04:33:40] <%$Definitely_Alive> i think they gonna spin that off into its own thing
[2022-12-08 04:33:42] <%OOOO_Sebby> people too focused on mythology and not on game story
[2022-12-08 04:33:42] <%$KingJayEagle> Angerbooba
[2022-12-08 04:33:42] <%ApogeeRL> yeah she was the worst character hands down
[2022-12-08 04:33:43] <+psford> give me a verbosity slider in every game. goes from "talk me through this" to "for the love of god stfu"
[2022-12-08 04:33:45] <%+darkart800> loki has no love interest in the mythology I think
[2022-12-08 04:33:46] <%$bigvin81> to deus ex machina the end of her teleporting them away
[2022-12-08 04:33:46] <%gearhound99> Falcor and Atreu?
[2022-12-08 04:33:47] <%+Tocnir> I get the feeling they want to make an Atreus+Angrboda sequel
[2022-12-08 04:33:47] <%bo_jaxon34> Artemis
[2022-12-08 04:33:48] <%MercuryChaser> Girl for boi
[2022-12-08 04:33:48] <%+doubled49> she's an exposition dump
[2022-12-08 04:33:49] <%lamda00> Atreus needs some love too i guess LUL
[2022-12-08 04:33:50] <%Miser_Mask> but without her how would you go to magic color forest world
[2022-12-08 04:33:51] <Pepsicraver> Ironwood was the worst part of the whole game imho.
[2022-12-08 04:33:55] <%Vswed> im really lining up well with barb stream times as of late LuL
[2022-12-08 04:33:56] <%+Trip473> but burger was MVP
[2022-12-08 04:33:57] <%$reservoir_dawgs> Angraboda literally served no point to the story
[2022-12-08 04:33:59] <%Vswed> sup folks
[2022-12-08 04:34:02] <ribpdf> what about burger
[2022-12-08 04:34:04] <%Zere_Zavier> She was the driving force behind Atreus ‘s dumb decision
[2022-12-08 04:34:05] <cnv123> Burger was the best
[2022-12-08 04:34:07] <%ApogeeRL> she was just some teen romance crungo imo
[2022-12-08 04:34:07] <%+darkart800> I think they literally created her just to give atreus a love interest
[2022-12-08 04:34:11] <%$KingJayEagle> Why Thor big chub though
[2022-12-08 04:34:12] <%DoctorBlowfly> It's Giant stuff!

[2022-12-08 04:34:14] <%HumourlessPig> Burger was MVP LUL KEKW
[2022-12-08 04:34:16] <%gearhound99> she wants to do Kratos

[2022-12-08 04:34:23] <%$reservoir_dawgs> The Ragnarok event itself was the most anticlimactic and boring moment of the game as well

[2022-12-08 04:34:30] <%+doubled49> At least Thrude was cool

[2022-12-08 04:34:42] <%afloppyweiner> Dragur holes were annoying
[2022-12-08 04:34:42] <%Miser_Mask> in a different game with a good story, we all love Burger
[2022-12-08 04:34:43] <%+Trip473> burger is the elden lord i think
[2022-12-08 04:34:43] <%$TheMuznick> he's Birgir
[2022-12-08 04:34:44] <%$BuryTheNight> If Atreus is the future of the GoW series then the future is gloomy

[2022-12-08 04:34:51] <%+localtoast_3000> My wife was watching and asked wtf he even did and why did he need to dive off
[2022-12-08 04:34:54] <%+doubled49> It's 100% Marvel writing
[2022-12-08 04:35:01] <%$KingJayEagle> So you're saying the writing was bad? LUL
[2022-12-08 04:35:08] <%Wry____> I just watched the new thor movie and I fucking hated it

[2022-12-08 04:35:15] <%$TheMuznick> yes
[2022-12-08 04:35:17] <%$TheMuznick> NODDERS
[2022-12-08 04:35:18] <%DoctorBlowfly> They knew what they were
[2022-12-08 04:35:19] <teamLNCHBX> the least they could do NODDERSS
[2022-12-08 04:35:19] <%+JayDiz> and had actual orgies
[2022-12-08 04:35:20] <%gabbaghoull> at least they weren’t sentimental and moralizing pap
[2022-12-08 04:35:25] <%Megs_1300> “Orgy of blood and violence and death”
[2022-12-08 04:35:26] <%Randallooch> Marvel died with Endgame
[2022-12-08 04:35:27] <+eezye> Carnage can cure most writing woes
[2022-12-08 04:35:30] <%+mav87333> Ragnarok ended with Kratos going to Florida to retire
[2022-12-08 04:35:31] <+DesertGoldfish> It's not great, but it isn't awful
[2022-12-08 04:35:31] <%ApogeeRL> I don't like stories that take themselves more seriously than they deserve

[2022-12-08 04:35:35] <%CarbonAxiom> @gearhound99 You mean Forspoken?
[2022-12-08 04:35:37] <%Megs_1300> It was terribad
[2022-12-08 04:35:38] <%$Toadv1ne> What sucks is Christian Bale is actually good, but everything else is pretty lame.
[2022-12-08 04:35:38] <%CoffeeBreathingDragon> new Thor movie was ok. ...for playing in the background while vacuuming
[2022-12-08 04:35:39] <%$BuryTheNight> it is the worse than Dark World. Hated Thor 4
[2022-12-08 04:35:39] <%bo_jaxon34> Violent orgies cmonBruh

[2022-12-08 04:35:43] <%$KingJayEagle> @Randallooch In my opinion they died farther back than that.
[2022-12-08 04:35:43] <%gearhound99> @carbonaxiom lmao yes
[2022-12-08 04:35:47] <%$JerryBrownG> i saw someone saying dr strange 2 was the best movie of the year...
[2022-12-08 04:35:49] <%+doubled49> I hated the new movie because it just shits on the source material so badly
[2022-12-08 04:35:52] <%$Lance_J> I wish that's how ragnarok ended.  just Kratos going absolutely batshit and killing everyone
[2022-12-08 04:35:52] <%gabbaghoull> more like God of Warm
[2022-12-08 04:35:56] <%HumourlessPig> New thor is better than Thor2
[2022-12-08 04:35:56] <%AflacGoose> be better

[2022-12-08 04:36:02] <%$reservoir_dawgs> GoW 1-3 at least had a satisfying conclusion. I feel cheated playing Ragnarok after the amazing GoW 2018 game
[2022-12-08 04:36:02] <%CarbonAxiom> @gearhound99 I hope the game is good. The movement is amazing

[2022-12-08 05:07:45] <$DarkShadowRift> Agreed ^
[2022-12-08 05:07:49] <%$sournewt> On perfumes, yeah. I liked it for the weapon buffs n stuff
[2022-12-08 05:07:50] <$jamwerd16> the protection perfume is really powerful
[2022-12-08 05:08:03] <NowOrTater> I NEVER felt the need to craft anything with the hordes of material I gathered. When I got the perfumes I didn’t even bother
[2022-12-08 05:08:08] <%$Mylexsi> ironskin perfume though girldmZoom
[2022-12-08 05:08:21] <%sexygrandma11> Your sword looks like a giant quill.
[2022-12-08 05:08:24] <%+BougiePower> build optimization for farming is always great
[2022-12-08 05:08:24] <%+agchee> Pots were good sometimes. But I didn't craft that much.
[2022-12-08 05:08:24] <%box_chan_> i have seen that they are killer for invasions but invasion players are the sweatiest from the all
[2022-12-08 05:08:25] <%$Bees_Make_Honey_> The bread economy is indeed unbalanced towards the rich Madge
[2022-12-08 05:08:27] <%kaneDamascus> its hella useful tho.... but will i spend a single point of limited resources? HELL NO.
[2022-12-08 05:08:36] <%yooden1> the crafting gives you outs if you didnt find spells for cures
[2022-12-08 05:08:38] <%MiloticMaster2> they also do no damage
[2022-12-08 05:08:44] <%$sournewt> One of my friends has a lot of fun with crafting. It wasn’t really for me, but some of the items can be fun to have in your back pocket
[2022-12-08 05:08:47] <%saturn_ring> TOTK hopefully has a crafting system. BOTW's description mentioned "crafting" but turns out it was cooking and limited stuff
[2022-12-08 05:08:54] <%happy_axe> i also feel like the recipes are too spread out. like how many recipe books are there? 30? 40? yeey i found  a book that lets me make 1 shitty turtle neck
[2022-12-08 05:08:56] <%McFixit> i think god of war does weapons really well
[2022-12-08 05:08:56] <%Vswed> i end up ignoring most things in first playthroughs that dont impose themself on me
[2022-12-08 05:08:59] <%box_chan_> yeah but flame cleanse me exists
[2022-12-08 05:09:00] <%$korbaton> FromSoft seems to me that they have a recurring case of "distracted by the shiny"
[2022-12-08 05:09:04] <mrwhalenator> I barely craft but on Torrent I'm spamming anyways

[2022-12-08 05:09:31] <Zarix7> infinity health instantly
[2022-12-08 05:09:37] <thegoldendonger> skyrim had the issue, smithing and enchanting was broken if you perked into it
[2022-12-08 05:09:38] <+eezye> and the ingredients aren't dangerous to get
[2022-12-08 05:09:47] <threewisemen12> fallout was the same, heal is pause is an overall really poor idea
[2022-12-08 05:09:49] <%$SandwichSlap> Makes up for the uinbalanced weapon durability
[2022-12-08 05:09:54] <%$Septomor> last of is decent, craft your ammo which is pretty limited

[2022-12-08 05:09:55] <%+agchee> Yep. I barely used that stuff towards the end. Especially with Mipha's grace, or whatever.

[2022-12-08 05:17:12] <%+darkart800> it will perform well, pokemon is gamefreak's fault, not the switch
[2022-12-08 05:17:14] <$evilishies> xenoblade devs are helping nintendo on tears of the kingdom to help with teseellation
[2022-12-08 05:17:14] <%$Coelacanth88> They REALLY need an improved Switch or something.
[2022-12-08 05:17:15] <alexthecoreguy> barb u r great!thanks for the great streams!!
[2022-12-08 05:17:16] <%RaysFTW> No. It's VERY different teams. You can't compare Pokemon to Zleda.
[2022-12-08 05:17:18] <%KoltonMcCombo> Poke’no
[2022-12-08 05:17:22] <%RaysFTW> Zelda.*
[2022-12-08 05:17:26] <shamusyea> It’s zelda I don’t think they can half ass it
[2022-12-08 05:17:27] <%$unknownohyeah> astel should be way harder
[2022-12-08 05:17:29] <$jamwerd16> This Astel of the Yelough cave Astel?
[2022-12-08 05:17:31] <%+masmango> surely they'll have better coding in the Zelda dev team. hopefully
[2022-12-08 05:17:32] <%yooden1> 60 fps should not be asking for much

[2022-12-08 05:17:48] <%+darkart800> @yooden1 I don't think you can get 60 fps on the switch's hardware though
[2022-12-08 05:17:57] <%+darkart800> I think asking for 60fps is to much

[2022-12-08 05:18:09] <%+sausage_jones> Are you going to play Zelda OoT Master Quest? It makes the dungeons way harder and really changes the experience of the game
[2022-12-08 05:18:15] <%saturn_ring> LMAO
[2022-12-08 05:18:22] <%ArtificialNebulae> On emulator maybe

[2022-12-08 05:18:39] <waywarddevil> What were you supposed to do to avoid the attack? Dodge, Duck, Dip, Dive and Dodge
[2022-12-08 05:18:40] <+Bomberbro02> I’d prefer a much more classic style of Pokémon that can handle the switch than the open world stuff that can’t even run
[2022-12-08 05:18:42] <%+Fail_Snail> people will buy the game then run it on emulators at 4k 60fps
[2022-12-08 05:18:52] <MartinScoresEZ> Time for a Potsanity OoT rando
[2022-12-08 05:18:58] <%+masmango> 30fps worked for BotW mostly. hopefully it'll be ok
[2022-12-08 05:19:03] <%Vinzi11a> The pirated copy online will be 60fps
[2022-12-08 05:19:11] <%neverhadfun1> felt like astel needed a bigger health bar.
[2022-12-08 05:19:24] <%+darkart800> well maybe ToTK will herald the release of the Switch's successor, like BOTW heralded the switch
[2022-12-08 05:19:30] <%Rtype> this boss looks like it's made of nerds rope
[2022-12-08 05:19:30] <%+Deadlyrage1989> @Bomberbro02 same
[2022-12-08 05:19:42] <%+agchee> Whenever Switch 2 comes out, would be cool if they unlocked BotW & TotK at 60fps.

[2022-12-08 05:20:28] <%+Fail_Snail> I always thought the one thing that could turn elden ring into a perfect game from an almost perfect game is some kind of dynamic enemy balancing system
[2022-12-08 05:20:28] <shamusyea> Astel is pretty

I seen a ad  on tv last night saying that they showing 6 of the resident evil movie. My support worker and I am playing dark souls and I said it’s a little like a turn based if you know what I mean.

[2022-12-08 14:59:37] <%drkirienko> the blue coins in Sunshine and the Korok seeds in BOTW both seemed like way too goddamn many collectibles

[2022-12-08 15:00:00] <%rmmod> skyward sword is better than sunshine. but at this point we are picking the fly shit outta the pepper

[2022-12-08 15:00:27] <camaleonczr> just the "oh death, become my sword once more" scene is better than whole gowr story

[2022-12-08 15:07:48] <%CarbonAxiom> @Manonfire387 The UK is the weirdest gaming market in the world. I occasionally look at their best selling games list and it never makes sense to me LUL
[2022-12-08 15:07:51] <%stayingrusty> idk i beat the game never going to the sewer lol

[2022-12-08 15:07:53] <+Apothecarried> wait there are two Mogh's? wtf
[2022-12-08 15:07:56] <%+AdamSabre> Out of the Souls games and Elden Ring, which do you recommend for a new player?
[2022-12-08 15:07:58] <akufishi> what would you put there instead of mohg?
[2022-12-08 15:08:01] <+ArisBach> Sewer Mogh is hard to get to, I would say out of the way.
[2022-12-08 15:08:02] <%+solidpeyo> but they needed to reuses all the bosses
[2022-12-08 15:08:02] <%+breadwatcher> oh i feel the opposite. sewer mohg is like foreshadowing for real mohg

[2022-12-08 15:08:22] <%MadKev> demon souls ps5 so good and nice graphics
[2022-12-08 15:08:24] <%thenecromancer19> Mohg could have been there, but just disappeared as you approached the barrier
[2022-12-08 15:08:25] <%cornsbakedgoods> going demon souls on ps5 to ds1 is ruff...
[2022-12-08 15:08:27] <%$ToxicYosh__> me who started with elden ring Stare
[2022-12-08 15:08:29] <iqmqsd> Isn't sewer mohg just a projection of Mohg? Like Margit being a projection of Morgott
[2022-12-08 15:08:29] <%+breadwatcher> they even do it with the song. sewer mohg's song is like a stripped down version of this one. i thought it was super cool.

[2022-12-08 15:23:59] <Vulfe> the moon is pretty good in PvE because it reduces the target's damage mitigation, the point isn't to do a lot of damage on its own

[2022-12-08 15:26:04] <%+breadwatcher> @unsolicited__richard str weapons do more hit stun though which i find really beneficial. some of the dex weapons dont stagger enemies at all which can make it hard.

[2022-12-08 15:26:26] <%flipvanmorritz> My first build was pure lack of imagination Berserk build, the only things I ever looked up were where to get the greatsword and ultimately the nights cavalry armour
[2022-12-08 15:26:26] <%firecrotch007> Fair enough I don’t think I would either on this game

[2022-12-08 15:26:35] <+herpesfreesince3> @RaysFTW I really doubt it, anybody with half a brain can see how little sense his build makes. And I kinda feel like the average person is smarter than Elon

[2022-12-08 15:36:28] <hereholdthis> both needed real dungeons

[2022-12-08 15:37:14] <%Burnsalive> There's an issue with that in Skyrim and fallout too. People just like to explore
[2022-12-08 15:37:14] <Vulfe> shrines were pretty fun in BotW but I didn't like how many of them were just like, here is a room with a chest, you did it
[2022-12-08 15:37:19] <%flipvanmorritz> After the first 1000 or so hours I thought the Elden Ring world felt dead lol
[2022-12-08 15:37:20] <+Carte422> I mean at least one's first run with Elden Ring, the exploration for the sake of it was fun - with BotW it was just "oh another shrine"
[2022-12-08 15:37:20] <+DeanBDean> You can fight double crucible knight in a side dungeon Kappa
[2022-12-08 15:37:21] <%CarbonAxiom> The map design of Elden Ring is most similar to BOTW, so it's not surprising that they might have similar problems. Still way better than any other open world game imo
[2022-12-08 15:37:24] <%happy_axe> they were fun once, second playthrough absolutely no point
[2022-12-08 15:37:24] <thescreechingweasel> at least 2

[2022-12-08 15:38:53] <swgomer> Im over 1000 hours that's 5 runs all endings and one I completed everything

[2022-12-08 15:39:06] <MeekMogwin> best shield is just don't get hit
[2022-12-08 15:39:09] <+JeanVaIjean24601> @JeanVaIjean24601 Yeah fair enough
[2022-12-08 15:39:28] <%CarbonAxiom> My first playthrough was 300 hours. I just slowly explored every inch of the game, did every cave, and beat every boss
[2022-12-08 15:39:28] <%flipvanmorritz> @swgomer I stopped on my 4th same character run through and honestly have no idea how long I played

[2022-12-08 15:39:43] <%Bagelstein33> I finally just beat her the other day. P2 sucked
[2022-12-08 15:39:43] <%FrenchFryApocalypse> Fuck that move
[2022-12-08 15:39:45] <%flipvanmorritz> wasn't this a 7 hour fight first time barb?
[2022-12-08 15:39:45] <%+ditchmcgee> roll forward twice
[2022-12-08 15:39:47] <failuer> @Topgun486 I like classic 2d platformers as much as the other guy but 223 hours per robot master seems a bit excessive
[2022-12-08 15:39:47] <%sparknfire> BARB, JUST ROLL FORWARD TWICE
[2022-12-08 15:39:48] <%+GlaceonYo> roll forward twice

[2022-12-08 15:40:05] <swgomer> @flipvanmorritz yeah if I wasn't a leveling nerd it wouldn't be so much but I like to be pretty close to max level when I finish the game
[2022-12-08 15:40:07] <%Modether> Once you figure it out the difficulty drops insanely
[2022-12-08 15:40:08] <%Vswed> HahaSweat
[2022-12-08 15:40:09] <%hogjosh> just let the mimic tear tank it :)
[2022-12-08 15:40:09] <%dgomezzzzz> She would have been much easier without that move
[2022-12-08 15:40:11] <%flipvanmorritz> I think I got lucky as fuck first time

[2022-12-08 15:40:23] <%BesideTheSide> i summoned the mimic and killed her in 3 tries and feel stripped
[2022-12-08 15:40:25] <%$big_show__> took me 10 monkaS
[2022-12-08 15:40:33] <%BrassRabbit> @cdubs0425 7 or so hours

[2022-12-08 15:40:44] <%flipvanmorritz> @swgomer I think I spent a lot of time in NG3 just farming in mogh's area for levels lol
[2022-12-08 15:40:46] <%midgarsommar> Took me probably a week
[2022-12-08 15:40:46] <%+breadwatcher> took me 8 hours first playthrough
[2022-12-08 15:40:48] <%+twistedfred87> I summoned like the bitch I am

[2022-12-08 15:40:57] <bigboycupcakes> actuallythey are runes not souls
[2022-12-08 15:40:57] <+JeanVaIjean24601> @JeanVaIjean24601 I was thinking trying a different build each time, but even that I overestimated
[2022-12-08 15:41:06] <%$DurianPuncher> 6 hours, iirc
[2022-12-08 15:41:09] <$chuckie1044> you can get the shield aow that increases the block guard
[2022-12-08 15:41:11] <+bozojazz> yep, took me so long to figure out how to dodge waterfowl
[2022-12-08 15:41:13] <PippoCH> Nerdge
[2022-12-08 15:41:13] <%+solidpeyo> is a bullshit fight IMO

[2022-12-08 15:41:14] <%+Manonfire387> The first maliketh fight I was watching barb stream the fight on my way to the airport. He finally beat her after I got my bags at my destination 5 hours later same stream

[2022-12-08 15:41:18] <+herpesfreesince3> My first melania kill took over 200 tries but I was doing Parry-crit only, no armor, hitless

[2022-12-08 15:41:20] <%+Leo_Fara> Roooots
[2022-12-08 15:41:20] <%ethanrmc> I hate the dudes that she summons in the second phase.
[2022-12-08 15:41:21] <%+RoyalD1> the healing was more annoying to me than the dance
[2022-12-08 15:41:21] <%higHChloride> it's not just the one move, it's also because i'm bad at elden ring
[2022-12-08 15:41:24] <+Ryan_FromCanada> I can fairly consistently dodge waterfowl now but the clone attack in phase 2 still fucks me
[2022-12-08 15:41:29] <%Vswed> lets get it NODDERS
[2022-12-08 15:41:29] <$Dracoraz> took me about 4 hours for malenia but I had already beaten the game
[2022-12-08 15:41:29] <fall3nPhD> when I beat malenia I relied on bloodhound's step to avoid waterfowl (still took 8hours lol)
[2022-12-08 15:41:31] <%+breadwatcher> @JeanVaIjean24601 yeah i mean a new build might be slow-ish until you get comfy. but you know where to go and dont wander aimlessly anymore. that saves a lot of time.
[2022-12-08 15:41:31] <cdubs0425> SHUT UP... said the guy that just blasted the guy for calling the health potion the wrong thing
[2022-12-08 15:41:32] <ruthlesspumpkin88> It took me about 2 hours to take her down

[2022-12-08 15:52:34] <%+breadwatcher> the big diff was you respect melania because you had trouble in the past. you didnt respect ofnir because you streamrolled him before.

[2022-12-08 15:52:40] <%Miets> maybe I'm just imagining it, but seemed like Melania was a little less agressive.
[2022-12-08 15:52:42] <%+Thorn_42> Sir Ofnir gets really tough depending on your build.
[2022-12-08 15:52:42] <hoodiefitz> Barb have you ever used a spear in this game?

[2022-12-08 15:52:50] <%The_Action_Man> I laughed at the vid that just grabbed Offnir and killed him with a Madness attack before he finished talking LUL
[2022-12-08 15:52:54] <%+ditchmcgee> you had a lot more practice against malenia
[2022-12-08 15:52:54] <+gnarranggnarrang> needed shield at ofnir

[2022-12-08 16:13:21] <%sporkboots> back in the day,
[2022-12-08 16:13:22] <%Miets> I hate the quest system in this game
[2022-12-08 16:13:23] <+bozojazz> back in the day in february
[2022-12-08 16:13:24] <%$tamar_socialite> back in the day....last year
[2022-12-08 16:13:24] <%Miets> its absolute dogshit
[2022-12-08 16:13:25] <johnthegg> the quest design in this game is just plain bad
[2022-12-08 16:13:26] <%ADumbPotatoe> oh people are on maps now?
[2022-12-08 16:13:29] <@%$deejay4am> @sparknfire You'd have to open a ticket with twitch support, we have zero control over stuff like sub transactions. That sucks though sorry twitch is being janky
[2022-12-08 16:13:33] <%$ShelbyvilleThrillhouse> BOOBA
[2022-12-08 16:13:34] <+Militia_X> the update was life saving
[2022-12-08 16:13:38] <swgomer> 10 months go by and its back in the day with elden ring.
[2022-12-08 16:13:39] <%Seda_Give> FromSoft quests are pretty weird
[2022-12-08 16:13:46] <sparknfire> @deejay4am on it, thanks. not blaming you all
[2022-12-08 16:13:48] <%gudemonster> BACK IN MY DAY
[2022-12-08 16:13:49] <%Dodorto> back in the day you didn't find the pot gigachad
[2022-12-08 16:13:56] <%+SpecialK919> We had to go uphill both ways to get to the NPCs
[2022-12-08 16:14:02] <%+dcboizero> magic as a first playthrough made me shit for a melee run
[2022-12-08 16:14:02] <@%$deejay4am> @sparknfire Oh of course, didn't think you were barbLove hope they can fix it for you!
[2022-12-08 16:14:04] <%$The5oClockShadow> Is there a quest system in this? LUL
[2022-12-08 16:14:05] <%+penguinfarm> "walk to this waypoint and talk to the character... walk to the other waypoint and kill these enemies"
[2022-12-08 16:14:06] <%$flojud50> how was the update?
[2022-12-08 16:14:06] <johnthegg> i love just advancing somewhere and locking myself out of a quest without realizing it LUL
[2022-12-08 16:14:08] <%$jomyani> PotFriend
[2022-12-08 16:14:08] <%Randallooch> most quests and glorified walking simulators that tell you everything and just point in the way you need to go
[2022-12-08 16:14:08] <%WokeMoralist> i liked it in dark souls, but that game isn't open world KEKW
[2022-12-08 16:14:11] <%DickZippem> A journal would be the happy medium imo. No waypoints, but a log of conversations and important conversations being marked would go a long way.
[2022-12-08 16:14:13] <%flipvanmorritz> fucking hate that shit
[2022-12-08 16:14:20] <%+Jewkaki> have you ever destroyed the giant chariot in the Fringefolk Hero's Grave to get the bow
[2022-12-08 16:14:21] <TheDankLordSauron> despise that
[2022-12-08 16:14:22] <%+solidpeyo> PotFriend quest
[2022-12-08 16:14:23] <%karlgerm> yeah that shit sucks
[2022-12-08 16:14:23] <%shopshopshop> i hate wow style questing where you have 30 arrows telling you where all the boars you have to kill are tho
[2022-12-08 16:14:25] <%rorschach834> What about talking to the Ranni doll?
[2022-12-08 16:14:31] <johnthegg> @penguinfarm in this game "go somewhere and get locked out of a quest" yay
[2022-12-08 16:14:32] <%+GlaceonYo> So that you can do it at your own pace technically? You hate being forced into it
[2022-12-08 16:14:34] <+TiLlTiLl0477> what about the gamba?
[2022-12-08 16:14:38] <+YyTonyMa> but then it becomes like every other game
[2022-12-08 16:14:40] <%Rainy_Dayze_> The weird sequence of talking to people at Ranni's tower still doesn't make sense to me
[2022-12-08 16:14:41] <+DeanBDean> Majora's Mask 3DS had a pretty good way to keep track of tasks
[2022-12-08 16:14:44] <voicesinthesky> thank you kindly
[2022-12-08 16:14:52] <%flipvanmorritz> just trying to get all of the different character interactions and not knowing why character x won't appear at location y
[2022-12-08 16:14:52] <%lucem3173> continue the quest
[2022-12-08 16:14:54] <%$big_show__> Smoge no pest
[2022-12-08 16:14:56] <%+the_onetrue_fist> kill him
[2022-12-08 16:14:56] <%box_chan_> advance the quest
[2022-12-08 16:14:56] <%$parael24601> You need to advance her quest
[2022-12-08 16:14:57] <%CarlDotCliff> I think it's the whole millicent quest line?
[2022-12-08 16:14:57] <%+solidpeyo> saved the girl
[2022-12-08 16:14:58] <%Azur85> modCheck
[2022-12-08 16:14:59] <%+Tall_GuyCA> what about the notebook from Majoras Mask?
[2022-12-08 16:15:00] <%thejumpingmouse> You have to get Milicent to the Prayer room iirc
[2022-12-08 16:15:00] <%$parael24601> And give her prosthesis
[2022-12-08 16:15:01] <%Miser_Mask> do you have to get the arm?
[2022-12-08 16:15:03] <+eebedebe> go back to millicent i think
[2022-12-08 16:15:04] <%shroomvolcano> give the prosthetic to millicent
[2022-12-08 16:15:04] <%+corybrowntricks> I missed lighting the Erdtree my first time through because I didn't rest at the grace
[2022-12-08 16:15:06] <izilion_> at least give a quest log, it's dumb when a npc send you somewhere, then refuse to repeat where they want you to go if you talk to them again
[2022-12-08 16:15:07] <%+penguinfarm> I just manually took notes in a text file while playing
[2022-12-08 16:15:08] <%thunderbunny24> Close your eyes and open your mouth
[2022-12-08 16:15:08] <%gudemonster> im not aware of how to get this sword?
[2022-12-08 16:15:11] <%ethanrmc> need to give her the prosthesis
[2022-12-08 16:15:12] <%OOOO_Sebby> gamba this barbCheeky
[2022-12-08 16:15:13] <+Militia_X> another menu for sidequests would be helpful
[2022-12-08 16:15:17] <%$The5oClockShadow> Night Mist was crucial for my magic run
[2022-12-08 16:15:21] <%lucem3173> You have to meet her in the Altus Plateua to give her the arm
[2022-12-08 16:15:22] <%Randallooch> the arm is from Niall right?
[2022-12-08 16:15:23] <+Mase_Face_> my biggest complaint with this game is the lack of a quest log for the side quests. My forgetful ass gets sidetracked and doesn't know where to go haha
[2022-12-08 16:15:25] <HugBringer> No quest system is a "Perfect" solution for all gamers
[2022-12-08 16:15:25] <%sporkboots> key items i think
[2022-12-08 16:15:26] <swgomer> prolly not yes it's under key items
[2022-12-08 16:15:26] <%+yoloryebread> Morrowind style journal
[2022-12-08 16:15:26] <%$parael24601> Arm is in Poison swamp castle
[2022-12-08 16:15:29] <%+mav87333> When you said back in the day, I imagined you first playthrough in black and white LUL
[2022-12-08 16:15:29] <%Spinjump19> cant give her the arm until she gets to altus
[2022-12-08 16:15:31] <%$Near____________> You have to give her the prothetelic arm yeah
[2022-12-08 16:15:33] <%$The5oClockShadow> I don't think you can get the arm until you've gotten Millicent to ALtus
[2022-12-08 16:15:34] <%+desufin> it's from a guy next to the castle
[2022-12-08 16:15:38] <%Miets> seems you do not have it
[2022-12-08 16:15:38] <%sporkboots> it's off to the side in that castle so if you beelined you wouldnt have picked it up
[2022-12-08 16:15:38] <%+Tall_GuyCA> pay the people?
[2022-12-08 16:15:39] <%The_Action_Man> It's in a treasure chest there, not a boss drop
[2022-12-08 16:15:39] <%+solidpeyo> time to search the castle
[2022-12-08 16:15:40] <%$big_show__> I have the arm LUL so thats what you do with it
[2022-12-08 16:15:44] <%thejumpingmouse> Probably missed it. It's out of the way if you go straight to the boss
[2022-12-08 16:15:46] <%Miets> time for poison castle

The arm and the balloon can then be dropped by random enemies in the Hollow, and the arm can again be sent up a floor. This must be repeated until both items are found in the Keep of the Lead Lord, after which they will be sent up to The Breach and Ox will receive the replacement. In return, Cadence rewards the player with Clone.

[2022-12-08 16:34:32] <%+IsItDataOrData> I feel like the Elden Beast fight should have been more akin to the Rykard fight. Like all of your melee attacks are long range
[2022-12-08 16:34:36] <%MCBanjoMike> I think the fight is mostly OK, but just way too long
[2022-12-08 16:34:39] <%$mainlymike> i feel like you tore through this run

[2022-12-08 16:44:08] <%PotatoShrimpi> 500 pages is basically a book
[2022-12-08 16:44:08] <%denvermullets> there will be no finish to the series, i'm convinced
[2022-12-08 16:44:11] <bigern22> Probably manuscript pages
[2022-12-08 16:44:11] <%+MrDisagree> winds of WInter is planned on being 503 pages

[2022-12-08 16:53:27] <%+R1NZL3R_87> @MatraTheEternal So, when you jump and don't press the jump button again Mario sinks like a rock. If you press jump and then press jump again (Regrab the jump button) Mario falls slower. So it's a mechanic in SMW to slow your falling speed and cover more ground in a jump

[2022-12-08 16:55:02] <@%$deejay4am> @MatraTheEternal Also, importantly: The concept of "regrab" exists only because you initially let go of the jump button so that your jump *height* is minimal (holding jump longer means you jump higher). so by "regrabbing" after a small jump, you can do a long distance with a short height
[2022-12-08 16:55:03] <%rivettmj> I think you have enough time if you hit all the chucks first time

[2022-12-08 17:40:01] <+Kiriyama_Art> The first two examples of Peach having a personality were in SMRPG and The 'Supe Mario Adventures' comic that ran in Nintendo Power, and in both of those she was pretty much identical to how she was in the trailer.

[2022-12-08 18:08:41] <+planetaryvision> It started in 1973 when BarbarousKing touched an arcade machine for the first time. Within minutes, he had mastered the controls. He had out thought the developers and quickly sought a game worthy of his skillset. Alas, there was nothing that Nintendo, Atari, or any game company could do to quench his thirst for a challenge. In 1996, he finally decided that if he wanted a challenge, he'd have to create it himself. From that point forward BarbarousKing has become a renowned creator of Kaizo.

[2022-12-08 18:20:07] <%+ech0cide> @cloudhppr the RMAH game that it started out as is looooong gone
[2022-12-08 18:20:07] <@%$deejay4am> @The_Hypist MK8 streams are usually on Fridays when they happen. Nothing is scheduled officially but that's the most likely time
[2022-12-08 18:20:08] <%manfred_bratwurst> @salemthecat_ taking out the bathroom break is casual
[2022-12-08 18:20:09] <%NotMacNamera> where bimp?
[2022-12-08 18:20:09] <%cloudhppr> @hoozimajiget_ I'll give it a chance either way, did it have a good feel to it?
[2022-12-08 18:20:10] <%dingusbingus655> it should but won't I think ugh
[2022-12-08 18:20:10] <%+IdolizeDT> @Serchinnho even though it wouldn't have won, I would've preferred to see grounded get the nomination over stray but I understand why as well. The awards are just some silly fun at the end of the day
[2022-12-08 18:20:11] <%$ToxicYosh__> why does the character look like the grimm from hollow knight
[2022-12-08 18:20:14] <cubby2tone> praying for ER
[2022-12-08 18:20:14] <%imisgrunbula> the hype around ER was so much higher than for Ragnarok

[2022-12-08 18:20:26] <%+doubled49> thank you
[2022-12-08 18:20:26] <%+GubDM> ER spits in the face of all modern video game design to its success, no way they'll let it win. UX designers would riot
[2022-12-08 18:20:27] <%$bigvin81> @ech0cide i agree.  i still play D3 every new season.  D3 definitely got better over time compared to how it started
[2022-12-08 18:20:34] <The_Hypist> @deejay4am Thanks I keep getting SMW/Elden Ring notifs but not for MK. I’ll keep a lookout
[2022-12-08 18:20:35] <@%$deejay4am> @The_Hypist *nights, i should clarify. Again that being said, Barb makes it up as he goes so no promises

[2022-12-08 18:20:37] <%sergimon90> I've never played Elden Ring so I can't say I hope it wins
[2022-12-08 18:20:37] <%NotMacNamera> Why is Genshin even in the conversation?  It came out it 2020
[2022-12-08 18:20:38] <%$Nubskok> If some5hing other than the big 2 win I'm gonna just stop tuning in
[2022-12-08 18:20:38] <+AlexSudati> Is the game awards like a fan vote or it's like an oscars situation?
[2022-12-08 18:20:39] <+DandyCheeks> Lol fair. But there is kinda a formula w coming up to a colony and fighting a captain or w a captain. I loved it but it got a little repetitive
[2022-12-08 18:20:43] <%cloudhppr> @ech0cide maybe I'll give it another try before I pass judgment
[2022-12-08 18:20:44] <%$dotBik> Oh fuck off lmao

[2022-12-08 18:21:02] <%rmmod> has barb said if he is planning on streaming straight through to the awards or coming back on early tonight?
[2022-12-08 18:21:07] <%+bluelion2179> There is a 100% chance Elden Ring wins
[2022-12-08 18:21:08] <%+Misssster_Anderson> @AlexSudati there's one category for chat chooses a best romhack but the rest is barb's choice

[2022-12-08 18:21:34] <%$freya_thuriaaz> Genshin has done well with it's live service.
[2022-12-08 18:21:44] <%$JPrimeMLG> is there an award for the game that makes barb look most like this: barbPlayingMarioMaker
[2022-12-08 18:21:45] <+itsmorzon> Genshin is eligibly for fan game of the year because it was nominated in the category barb mentioned
[2022-12-08 18:21:48] <+AlexSudati> @Misssster_Anderson I meant the game awards, not the barb romhack
[2022-12-08 18:21:53] <%+MentallyInept> Olli Olli World is very good.

[2022-12-08 18:22:10] <The_Hypist> This music sounds familiar what is it from?
[2022-12-08 18:22:12] <%+IdolizeDT> @Serchinnho yeah true, stray had a small cultural impact where grounded did not, that's true. Both grounded and stray were a breath of fresh air for me personally so I'm not really upset about it

[2022-12-08 18:23:39] <%+IdolizeDT> Genshin also has offered a reward in the past (however small) if they win. Yes I know the rewards are probably inconsequentially small, but I don't like the idea on principle

[2022-12-08 18:25:31] <%theEntropic> genshin was last year
[2022-12-08 18:25:32] <+davekoliati> Cult of the lamb also shouldve been there
[2022-12-08 18:25:33] <%+Darkenspirit> so its just a popularity contest
[2022-12-08 18:25:33] <%Crizzle777> grounded is sooo underrated
[2022-12-08 18:25:34] <blueskytreb82> Hasn't Genshin been out for more than a year?
[2022-12-08 18:25:35] <%+WiLDRAGE777> Grounded was hurt by it being an early access game.
[2022-12-08 18:25:38] <%MistaSprinkles> we should peter griffin this song
[2022-12-08 18:25:38] <Skrzelik> genshin is different category than grounded
[2022-12-08 18:25:38] <%Miets> @JeanVaIjean24601 the fly I killed a week ago
[2022-12-08 18:25:38] <%bizangles> They need a category for games that come out of early access
[2022-12-08 18:25:38] <$yasarumit> Genshin Impacts is a 2022 game?? WutFace
[2022-12-08 18:25:39] <abstract_octopus_> Stray is nominated?
[2022-12-08 18:25:40] <salemthecat_> Grounded is better than frontiers or genshin
[2022-12-08 18:25:42] <%Beeteebee> Grounded is my game of the year lol
[2022-12-08 18:25:43] <+DandyCheeks> The slight twist of xb3 w M was amazing imo. Loved that whole prison segment
[2022-12-08 18:25:44] <+Cosmic_Gnostic> hard agree
[2022-12-08 18:25:44] <%+Reef2489> this is a fun level to watch, cool setups
[2022-12-08 18:25:45] <%Papa_TheBard> stray is nominated yes
[2022-12-08 18:25:46] <Serchinnho> but barb, Genshin has made sooo much money KEKW
[2022-12-08 18:25:46] <%imisgrunbula> if genshin or sonic wins they really need to stop with the open votes
[2022-12-08 18:25:46] <random5765> this award is just some big marketing stunt to sell ad space
[2022-12-08 18:25:46] <%ethanrmc> Grounded is wonderful, the new update adds a lot of great quality of life changes.
[2022-12-08 18:25:47] <Idixal> Genshin is in a category Grounded doesn't fit in, though.
[2022-12-08 18:25:49] <The_Hypist> @salemthecat_ Not Frontiers

[2022-12-08 18:25:51] <%$UncleAlcoholic> @darkenspirit it's not voter nominated
[2022-12-08 18:25:51] <%$scrap_hearts> I'm playing Stray right now.  Really enjoying it but it's not GOTY
[2022-12-08 18:25:51] <%+juannaga> stray is just a  walking simulator
[2022-12-08 18:25:52] <@%$deejay4am> for anything?

[2022-12-08 18:25:56] <Sir_Chalk> Are you playing PoE tomorrow?
[2022-12-08 18:25:58] <%Miets> why is Stray at a video game awards show

[2022-12-08 18:26:01] <%$mhyri> fucking walking simulator
[2022-12-08 18:26:01] <%ShiraNoMai> It's a popularity vote, barb
[2022-12-08 18:26:01] <%Miets> its not a video game
[2022-12-08 18:26:02] <%OOOO_Sebby> do open world survival games ever win awards
[2022-12-08 18:26:02] <%Specter963> the fact that GoW was nominated for game of the year and Sonic wasn't because it was too new was bullshit
[2022-12-08 18:26:03] <%beckneard_> for real

[2022-12-08 18:26:06] <The_Hypist> @dotbik Okay

[2022-12-08 18:26:22] <%$crizotibin> the problem is that grounded was "released" like 2 year ago, in beta but wasn't considered a game of this year

[2022-12-08 18:27:16] <%MinisterGold> how much of stray's positive reception you think comes from you controlling a cute cat
[2022-12-08 18:27:17] <+itsmorzon> I signed up for the Playstation Pass thing since it was cheaper than buying Stray. I have not finished Stray.
[2022-12-08 18:27:18] <bm01> @Pointeblank I stopped and never went back when I reached the end game and only grind and frustration remained, but the exploration / story was nice
[2022-12-08 18:27:20] <+BlankLA> Stray is nothing but a meme game. Which is fine, but that's all it really is.
[2022-12-08 18:27:22] <%rmmod> if it had not been free on PS I do not know when/if I would've played stray
[2022-12-08 18:27:24] <Sizukun1> i'm guessing because it just tells a story despite the lack of gameplay

[2022-12-08 18:27:59] <%+breadwatcher> @xxxKing_Skeletorxxx because it barely had any game. there was like 1 game mechanic in it. is it good for what it is? sure. is it comparable to works like GOW:R or Elden Ring? absolutely not

[2022-12-08 18:28:28] <%rebelappliance> Vampire Survivors should be GOTY
[2022-12-08 18:28:29] <%$El_Profesore> @Pointeblank I mean, you didnt relly need to pay money to get most of the cool stuff. I loved it for wwhat it was. I also finished the story and exploration and was done, nice memories tho
[2022-12-08 18:28:30] <Nathrakus> stray is a great game for people that are new to games.
[2022-12-08 18:28:31] <%+Rogue_Kraft> you excited for the new DLC coming for vampire survivors??

[2022-12-08 18:28:35] <Nathrakus> I enjoyed stray a lot
[2022-12-08 18:28:37] <%Digmo62> Vampire Survivors created a genre
[2022-12-08 18:28:40] <%KOOLSM0KE> 1F0 is that hex code for the layer
[2022-12-08 18:28:40] <%BrandoExtreme> and its only $3
[2022-12-08 18:28:40] <Branigan801> hooked on vamp survivor right now
[2022-12-08 18:28:41] <%RaysFTW> I thought VS was dumb as shit when I watched you play. Then I played it and it consumed my life for a week.
[2022-12-08 18:28:41] <%Miets> 1f0 is the address of the tile in hexadecimal
[2022-12-08 18:28:42] <%+vlad3217> just came out on gamepass, been playing it a ton
[2022-12-08 18:28:44] <%bizangles> It's the HEX value
[2022-12-08 18:28:45] <talanel_> Vampire Survivors is worth the money
[2022-12-08 18:28:45] <%beckneard_> Vampire Survivors is getting a DLC too
[2022-12-08 18:28:45] <$Profmcstevie> The stupid is half the fun
[2022-12-08 18:28:45] <%Alraedris> I've dumped close to 150 hours for it. It's such mindless gameplay and D O P A M I N E
[2022-12-08 18:28:46] <%+ech0cide> @Alraedris it is to play, but man... the community that shows up for it on stream is awful
[2022-12-08 18:28:46] <%GnastyGnork_> video games are stupid though :)
[2022-12-08 18:28:47] <%Dublinbounder> Only $5
[2022-12-08 18:28:48] <@%$deejay4am> 1F0 is a hexadecimal number, and it is the behavior code right?"
[2022-12-08 18:28:49] <%+IdolizeDT> @cloudhppr Warframe was weird in the opposite way. The tutorial teaches you nothing and then you enter the star chart and get completely overwhelmed at the start. Once you make it past that initial hump it's an incredible game
[2022-12-08 18:28:51] <tg_emc> Have you played Risk of Rain 2?
[2022-12-08 18:28:51] <TheDankLordSauron> greatest $2 game of all time
[2022-12-08 18:28:51] <%+WiLDRAGE777> Vampire Survivors is the best 3$ game of all time
[2022-12-08 18:28:53] <+zerofoot> greatest game per dollar
[2022-12-08 18:28:54] <$The_Wollyhops> For $4 it's a no-brainer
[2022-12-08 18:28:54] <%riiviin> it was fun to get all of the achievements in VS
[2022-12-08 18:28:55] <%$crizotibin> to me its really bad that Kirby is not nominated to GOTY over Stray
[2022-12-08 18:28:56] <%$dotBik> Vampire Survivors didn't really grab me. Someone played Crimsonland
[2022-12-08 18:28:57] <Sir_Chalk> Vampire Survivors is like Diablo if it was a flash game
[2022-12-08 18:28:57] <bm01> vampire survivors looks like a game that started as a joke, but is actually fun
[2022-12-08 18:28:57] <%dumpchest> !marbles
[2022-12-08 18:28:58] <@%$bleach_dispenser> The Witness completed. No new marbles.

[2022-12-08 18:29:08] <%$Night_river> Vampire survivors is the dumbest game...that I can't stop playing
[2022-12-08 18:29:12] <Splufay> calling Stray a meme game is super disingenuous. whether or not you like it there was a lot of passion put into it
[2022-12-08 18:29:13] <%xdeepsx> lol, if they don't know 1F0... they don't know Map16
[2022-12-08 18:29:14] <%+Rei_N_Vaded> Vampire Survivors gets a 1.99$ DLC btw, coming out next week

[2022-12-08 18:29:20] <%+solidpeyo> you need to play 1 before 2
[2022-12-08 18:29:20] <%BrandoExtreme> for the price point, vampire survivors is insane value
[2022-12-08 18:29:20] <%$0__x> Plague Tale is ResidentSleeper
[2022-12-08 18:29:25] <%+LaLiLupin> What is considered a good game anymore, to me its all realitive. The whole thing is sort of a scam

[2022-12-08 18:29:50] <%KOOLSM0KE> i think you could tolerate a plague tale for a marbles pick LUL
[2022-12-08 18:29:52] <%+breadwatcher> @Splufay passion doesnt make a great game though. its hard to compare it to something like elden ring.

[2022-12-08 18:36:00] <hoozimajiget_> @cloudhppr  they plan on seasons but they've said generally those seasonal systems won't be added to the core game (how d3 seasons work, each one new flavour and doesnt persist post season). They really improved d3 with their season ideas, it just took them ~6 years after release to get it down. So hopefully they learned a few lessons there

[2022-12-08 19:08:15] <Marloosha> Tunic was sick. Particually the last puzzle.

[2022-12-08 19:08:23] <WolfGuy423> ive heard everyone not liking the combat
[2022-12-08 19:08:25] <%thejumpingmouse> The combat was pretty weak. The puzzles were fun though
[2022-12-08 19:08:26] <%GnastyGnork_> did you like Deaths Door?
[2022-12-08 19:08:31] <+Cobrahh> always felt like i had to be inside their hitbox in tunic just ot hit anything
[2022-12-08 19:08:32] <%Xintoxed> Chat yes he did get to the rat. So he gave it a solid chance.
[2022-12-08 19:08:36] <%thejumpingmouse> Deaths door combat felt much better
[2022-12-08 19:08:36] <%MCBanjoMike> Tunic boss fights try to make you do too much for how not-great the controls are

[2022-12-08 19:08:50] <%+solidpeyo> @gabbaghoull depends on Activision, they are the ones how hire from software to do sekiro
[2022-12-08 19:08:54] <%$oPatron> @Demagus3 hahahaha
[2022-12-08 19:08:58] <%ShiraNoMai> That's valid
[2022-12-08 19:08:59] <+Cobrahh> the puzzles are the standout part
[2022-12-08 19:09:05] <%+Rubidium2> Everyone keeps saying the puzzles in Tunic are great.  I played for an hour and didn't find any puzzles, so I quit
[2022-12-08 19:09:07] <%Seda_Give> Did you use a lot of tools during fights?
[2022-12-08 19:09:08] <%baconinyourface> Not presenting any awards tonight?

[2022-12-08 19:09:09] <%gabbaghoull> Hyper Light Drifter is a better version of Tunic
[2022-12-08 19:09:11] <%+Misssster_Anderson> death's door was great
[2022-12-08 19:09:12] <%ropeaderp> The game manual was super nostalgic

[2022-12-08 19:09:29] <%+Phadafi> Damn, loved the game, best than most zelda IMO, but it is not for everybody
[2022-12-08 19:09:31] <%goody8727> Tunic is the only game to make me pull out the notebook for puzzle solving since i was akid
[2022-12-08 19:09:31] <%GnastyGnork_> Deaths Door Sequel would be cool
[2022-12-08 19:09:31] <kirby_kingdom> LUL
[2022-12-08 19:09:33] <%Xintoxed> Tunic is a puzzle game hidden behind an action adventure game.

[2022-12-08 19:10:08] <%Demagus3> well barb did finish the witness, so the math checks out
[2022-12-08 19:10:10] <%$Atomic_ColliderSG> The music is from a really cool puzzle platformer on SNES
[2022-12-08 19:10:10] <%$reservoir_dawgs> Tunic is easily worse than the witness

[2022-12-08 19:58:38] <%+IdolizeDT> steelcase is one of the most reputable chair and office furniture brands in the world. They make good stuff. Mesh chairs only SEEM like a scam because companies like Autonomous make garbage and sell as some nice furniture, putting a stain on the whole idea

[2022-12-08 20:13:06] <%+DeNarm> on the right it says "required items"

[2022-12-08 20:13:11] <%$BADeleine> I like to look at collections vs individual mods cause people tend to clump together compatible mods

[2022-12-08 20:13:28] <%zombiepatches> @BarbarousKing Xorberax's Legacy is a sort of catch all, make the AI harder, more options for the player mod that includes things like dismemberment

[2022-12-08 20:14:28] <%+ditchmcgee> @BarbarousKing for the dismemberment, you're probably going to want to turn off the "slow motion" kill
[2022-12-08 20:14:31] <%$jack_of_hertz> you can make anything work on steamdeck if you have infinite time
[2022-12-08 20:14:32] <%Sendayen> Is the RTS camera mod on there? Might switch from nexus to workshop
[2022-12-08 20:14:40] <%lefthandblues> in my experience they've just worked on the deck
[2022-12-08 20:14:45] <random5765> why is steam interface so small in 2022? =(
[2022-12-08 20:14:52] <%MementoMori_9313> Yes I have a modded elden ring on my steam deck
[2022-12-08 20:14:53] <%$bigvin81> Nexus has better mods, Steam Workshop has the easier install barbShrug nothing stopping you from using both
[2022-12-08 20:14:53] <%+MarMar0326> Anything on steam workshop is plug and play if Steam has enabled it. Nexus mods take a little more work in desktop mode.

[2022-12-08 20:29:07] <shiny_dubwool> Yeah most mods won't break a save so you should be able to activate them
[2022-12-08 20:29:12] <%MattiaV96> tournaments are non lethal damage only
[2022-12-08 20:29:15] <%SinfulC> Most of them yes
[2022-12-08 20:29:19] <%$trenchiest> Yep
[2022-12-08 20:29:26] <%SinfulC> The ones that overhaul typically break saves, but you didn't get any overhaul mods.

[2022-12-08 20:30:56] <%+NavySpheals> not any better
[2022-12-08 20:30:59] <%$mikemountain> honestly I think it's related to the horse actually moving up and down
[2022-12-08 20:31:01] <%RaysFTW> I think it's just horseback

[2022-12-08 20:31:16] <+Balbazack_> might be due to horse riding aswell
[2022-12-08 20:31:18] <%RaysFTW> I don't think it's choppy at all. The horseback animation is just weird is all.
[2022-12-08 20:31:19] <%getsuga_unbridled> I think it looks good
[2022-12-08 20:31:19] <%MarkKnightRises> is it choppy for you @BarbarousKing ?
[2022-12-08 20:31:20] <whiskeypixels> I thought it was just the horse riding

[2022-12-08 20:31:54] <%MattiaV96> @humourlesspig gore mode works only when you get a kill not a stun, tournaments are non lethal weapons
[2022-12-08 20:32:07] <%$mikemountain> damn MonkaW
[2022-12-08 20:32:10] <%slm_k> the graphics are looking way better from the previous run
[2022-12-08 20:32:13] <%+Corrugate> I love how you have to do -20 damage to the face 6 times and they just do a casual -60 in one hit.

[2022-12-08 20:42:21] <%flipvanmorritz> the original 3 are solid, after the long break it kinda goes a bit overboard I felt

[2022-12-08 20:42:28] <%$Nymh79> well... Blaine the Mono was the last fun thing, I should say.

[2022-12-08 20:42:45] <+RaspberryWoof> definitely I think the dark tower became more interesting when it was like a group of people fighting a train and doors that lead to other worlds and crab battles
[2022-12-08 20:42:49] <%Missing_Node> @DurianPuncher It's the same exact combat but it's a bit smoother.

[2022-12-08 20:44:16] <%mcsmith012> the premise of on writing is that if you're okay at writing it can make you better, but if you're just bad there's nothing to be done

[2022-12-08 21:05:42] <%MattiaV96> @missing_node weakest in what sense? gameplay wise or for what you get for smithing? because I find it the strongest most useful thing you can do
[2022-12-08 21:05:54] <+RetroMakoStar> its definitely a long term investment
[2022-12-08 21:05:54] <%+seedmole> yeah you can afford to sit in a town with a huge army hemmoraging wages, and still make money
[2022-12-08 21:05:57] <%Burnsalive> @spooonsss Smithing used to be even more useless because the stuff you could make was worse than what you could loot.
[2022-12-08 21:06:00] <%+bazinga219124> spear fight is a pain
[2022-12-08 21:06:00] <%zombiepatches> and the weapons you can make are straight broken, but its hard to find the right mix of items
[2022-12-08 21:06:00] <%+supers3xyseacrest> crushing blow
[2022-12-08 21:06:00] <%Missing_Node> @MattiaV96 Gameplay wise. It's boring as hell, not fun, and not balanced.
[2022-12-08 21:06:00] <shiny_dubwool> The smithing economy used to be even more fucked, where basic crossbows would sell for like 100K
[2022-12-08 21:06:02] <%nonamewizard> you want to make one of your characters a smith like invest all your kids points into it

[2022-12-08 21:06:46] <%MattiaV96> @missing_node I see and i can agree with that, smithing is fun only for two handed swords while everything else is a pain

[2022-12-08 21:07:56] <%$TWCblank> you might be able to use it 2-handed, but you'll have to check once you get it

[2022-12-08 21:11:04] <%Papa_TheBard> i think they will announce paid dlc for elden ring
[2022-12-08 21:11:06] <%vanikin3> I feel like there may be references to those games (like patches) , but probably won't ever get dark souls 4 or whatever
[2022-12-08 21:11:06] <%+seedmole> it jumps once, says "see i'm not dark souls"
[2022-12-08 21:11:08] <%kevbrochill_> but jumping
[2022-12-08 21:11:09] <%+Kristoph_Darkstorm> Elden ring is essentially dark souls 4
[2022-12-08 21:11:14] <CaptnBast> Scalpel is a great sword
[2022-12-08 21:11:22] <%araasic> mount and blade is fun to watch
[2022-12-08 21:11:23] <%cloudhppr> it's pretty much dark souls
[2022-12-08 21:11:26] <%$Headhuntern1> Dark Souls 2 remake
[2022-12-08 21:11:29] <%+solidpeyo> repeat the same story from DS 1 like they did with DS3
[2022-12-08 21:11:32] <%akaScruffyChef> We could use another Sekiro-like game from FS though.
[2022-12-08 21:11:34] <%+thethorgot> they could make a proper Dark Souls 2 sequel

[2022-12-08 22:59:09] <%$Sid_Hoffman> As a landlord... very correct.

[2022-12-08 22:59:25] <%InfiniteLimit314> this game is pretty cool. it was on my radar, got so many games to play right now
[2022-12-08 22:59:26] <%+gabe_the_engineer> nor appreciation of the property. we paid $350 and now houses appaise like $650.
[2022-12-08 22:59:29] <BigMiv> pay rent? why dont i just burn a big pile of money?
[2022-12-08 22:59:33] <%$Lexibee86> Which is ironic because the high price of rent makes it really difficult to save up for a house.
[2022-12-08 22:59:42] <%Mebbeso> Rent has increased unreasonably in my area. Wages have remained stagnant.
[2022-12-08 22:59:46] <+0wlPacino> that's why you squat instead
[2022-12-08 22:59:55] <%CoffeeBreathingDragon> interest rates and house prices around me are so freaking insane

[2022-12-08 23:00:07] <%$TheMuznick> that's the situation I'm currently in, I don't have a choice and that trapped feeling is infuriating
[2022-12-08 23:00:12] <%eltzie> burning money won't keep you warm as long as paying rent, yet.
[2022-12-08 23:00:20] <%$Lexibee86> Rent and CoL has increased everywhere in the world while wages remain the same if not worse due to inflation.
[2022-12-08 23:00:21] <%AflacGoose> if only there was a quest line that has that goal barbThink
[2022-12-08 23:00:24] <%$3H_Hydracor> It does.
[2022-12-08 23:00:27] <%$Zabrewulf_X> we got lucky with the house. it was built 7 years ago, so it's fairly new. We just need to install gutters and make minor changes to the sink aerators

[2022-12-08 23:00:35] <CaptnBast> Buy-in right now sucks so horribly. Prices still insane while rates are returning to low from historical levels. However the insane price inflation of houses at 6-8% compounding interest is criminal
[2022-12-08 23:00:37] <%CoffeeBreathingDragon> Barb I don't donate anymore because I need to save for a house barbGabnon
[2022-12-08 23:00:39] <%riiviin> the quest line has a goal like that
[2022-12-08 23:00:40] <%$TWCblank> it does
[2022-12-08 23:00:42] <%$The_Dog_Rules> Yes
[2022-12-08 23:00:42] <%+SlayRod30> no. don't complete it
[2022-12-08 23:00:43] <%nonamewizard> yeah you have to make it like either the empire or non-empire factions only control a few setlments
[2022-12-08 23:00:43] <%$trenchiest> Banner does it
[2022-12-08 23:00:46] <%$KPtN_Horse> its like risk, you win at total supremacy?
[2022-12-08 23:00:49] <PotatoWaffles2> nowadays, its better for young people to live with their parents for most of their 20s, to save for a house
[2022-12-08 23:00:53] <%+AntoniusMinotaurus> The banner quest is like really important
[2022-12-08 23:00:55] <%+bentmywookies> bannerlord is eliminate empire or non empire factions
[2022-12-08 23:00:57] <King_Sisyphus> chat, was there ever a PoE stream?
[2022-12-08 23:00:57] <%Missing_Node> The banner doesn't finish the game but it is the first half of the campaign.
[2022-12-08 23:00:59] <%$safetscissors> I largely agree about the rent thing, but that money is also getting you a roof above your head. you have to pay for that anyway, unless you live with your parents or something. it's not like you're burning money
[2022-12-08 23:01:02] <%$3H_Hydracor> Partially. You have to also unite the empire.
[2022-12-08 23:01:04] <%+QuartzB_> never finished all the quests and wonders where the end game is KEKW
[2022-12-08 23:01:08] <%bandi_cootz> talking to 10 nobles is one of the dumber quests ive ever done
[2022-12-08 23:01:11] <%Missing_Node> After finishing the banner you have to either unite or destroy the empire.
[2022-12-08 23:01:13] <King_Sisyphus> Hurray! I didn't miss it.
[2022-12-08 23:01:22] <%nonamewizard> even after the banner you have to control the VAST majority of the map
[2022-12-08 23:01:25] <%$trenchiest> Once you declare that you have it, you must keep a number of settlements to claim total supremacy
[2022-12-08 23:01:25] <+chasedogy> Do you have a mortgage now?
[2022-12-08 23:01:27] <%+Toasticus> after making the banner, either give it to a faction or make your own kingdom. Probably way faster to just join one
[2022-12-08 23:01:34] <%Ekin0x> younger barb: WE NEED MORE MONEY
[2022-12-08 23:01:34] <%$safetscissors> agreed
[2022-12-08 23:01:37] <CaptnBast> It is defacto more expensive to be poor
[2022-12-08 23:01:42] <%+dcboizero> I hated my upstairs neighbors. So fucking loud screaming at his call of duty games
[2022-12-08 23:01:43] <%Dodorto> i recently bough my first house and i'm moving and shit, but i have it easier than the average person, because i'm alone and my family isn't worried about money
[2022-12-08 23:01:59] <Zerixar> you make the banner, and then you have to make or join a kingdom, and then achieve one of a couple different "victory" conditions
[2022-12-08 23:02:00] <%+ditchmcgee> which is crazy because some rent nowadays is more expensive than a mortgage cost
[2022-12-08 23:02:01] <%thejumpingmouse> The Pratchett boots economy is the best example of it's more expensive to be poor
[2022-12-08 23:02:04] <%$Lexibee86> @safetscissors Yes but I'm one to believe that the bare essential to just living shouldn't cost anything. Radical, I know.
[2022-12-08 23:02:06] <%+dcboizero> LUL
[2022-12-08 23:02:15] <%$Zabrewulf_X> the only downside for the move was we had to break the lease. it cost us almost $3k to break
[2022-12-08 23:02:16] <%+dcboizero> as a neighbor, neither fuck you
[2022-12-08 23:02:16] <%Leftarios> depends on what youre better at KEKW
[2022-12-08 23:02:24] <%$jack_of_hertz> I got in when interest rates were low in 2020. I feel very fortunate
[2022-12-08 23:02:24] <%+ditchmcgee> it's awful
[2022-12-08 23:02:28] <%meinsaft> There are a ton of examples of being poor costing more money.
[2022-12-08 23:02:28] <%pinktechnique> it is bad
[2022-12-08 23:02:33] <%The_Action_Man> @jack_of_hertz same

[2022-12-08 23:02:43] <@%$DanTheVP> Mortage to Rent is mostly the same most places
[2022-12-08 23:02:45] <%+dcboizero> The duplex we got into is great in suburbia
[2022-12-08 23:02:45] <$BennettYeo> The data is available yet, but I'm pretty sure the house prices are going up
[2022-12-08 23:02:47] <%$RolandWilliams> the downpayment is the hard part
[2022-12-08 23:02:48] <+0wlPacino> we're seeing the last generation of people that will actually be buying houses
[2022-12-08 23:02:48] <%+AntoniusMinotaurus> Build the banner then Simp hard for Rheaga.
[2022-12-08 23:02:52] <%+maze216> It just sucks if something goes out
[2022-12-08 23:02:53] <CaptnBast> 765 credit score.  House was 335k and my interest rate is 6.8%. Absolutely reemed on a mortgage
[2022-12-08 23:02:54] <$BennettYeo> I think we only have data for the spring sales
[2022-12-08 23:02:55] <%wolftickets88> we got sooooo lucky with when we refinanced. So lucky
[2022-12-08 23:03:00] <%denvermullets> we own an apt in NYC and it's so wild that you pay a building fee on top of mortgage
[2022-12-08 23:03:00] <%pinktechnique> i'm trying to save up with my partner right now, but the market makes it feel impossible
[2022-12-08 23:03:04] <$tizzy676> The markets are coming down. For the last couple months the amount properties have doubled in my city.
[2022-12-08 23:03:05] <%+dcboizero> the payments are not the problem
[2022-12-08 23:03:09] <BigMiv> ye rent is $1800 at my old apartment, and my friend owns a house and has a $500 mortgage
[2022-12-08 23:03:10] <%denvermullets> sometimes as much as a mortgage
[2022-12-08 23:03:11] <%$MajorMeowMix> @danthevp LMAO rent where I'm at is 2.5x a mortgage on average

[2022-12-08 23:03:16] <%$crittrTV> it's still terrible, but now it's less because of high listing prices and more because interest rates for mortgage are ridiculous
[2022-12-08 23:03:16] <%$Blastphemy1290> only need 120k down for a decent house here Deadge
[2022-12-08 23:03:19] <%MiloticMaster2> i think they're coming down but rent is still bad

[2022-12-08 23:03:26] <%+gabe_the_engineer> rents are still going up on average, but they're _close_ to not increasing this year.
