[2023-01-06 00:33:23] <azmiaa> but twitch is SEEMINGLY also not doing anything to try to improve - unlike youtube who are listening to people like ludwig karagiNod i think youtube will outdo twitch in like 5 years

[2023-01-06 00:38:39] <yourneighbourhoodbean> i think they meant it probably in like a cute way like it's so cute i just wanna munch it
[2023-01-06 00:38:39] <%andreaaar28> eat in kisses maybe ???
[2023-01-06 00:38:40] <palotudq> @xo_Brianna_xo that's what I thought haha

[2023-01-06 00:38:45] <%Missygirl93> Maybe snap is cute

[2023-01-06 00:38:48] <$rabidcherry> isnt that a way to say something is cute?
[2023-01-06 00:38:48] <elsa950_> snappyyy
[2023-01-06 00:38:48] <%+jaylynessa> maybe PET the cat instead heh
[2023-01-06 00:38:50] <%+haddybinhey> Probably just cuteness agression

[2023-01-06 00:38:50] <%+WillowCreekWanderer> I'd like to do the opposite, i.e. feed the cat a treat
[2023-01-06 00:38:50] <AlfredoBunns> "so cute i could just eat you" kinda thing probably??
[2023-01-06 00:38:52] <+lilyjb1996> maybe they ment she is soo cute they want to eat her ????

[2023-01-06 00:38:53] <veja1> I mean maybe he meant that the cat was very cute it's like a saying that you like something so much you wanna eat it
[2023-01-06 00:38:53] <%magsims> you know when something is so cute you like kinda wanna bite it you know lol
[2023-01-06 00:38:53] <danie485> Not Snap

[2023-01-06 00:38:54] <%JustyceXims> Maybe they were saying she‚Äôs so cute they could eat her up
[2023-01-06 00:38:56] <@%Little_Dica> One tip to get unbanned is don't shift blame on your siblings LOL
[2023-01-06 00:38:57] <%oanayu> i sometimes have the urge to say "you're so cute i wanna eat you" to my cat because it's a weird brain thing when something is cute
[2023-01-06 00:38:57] <%Necrodancers> oohh in spanish it's common to say you wanna eat something cute, like babies and pets, it sounds weird to explain it now lmao
[2023-01-06 00:38:57] <%$nuclearself> insult my cat and i will ban you irl
[2023-01-06 00:38:59] <%+xo_Brianna_xo> @speeedlemon Yeah that‚Äôs immediately what I thought

[2023-01-06 00:43:48] <+forgetfulsinner> I actually follow streamers who don't allow ban appeals. Only because they will ALWAYS ask what was meant by the comment in chat.
[2023-01-06 00:43:49] <%+gamesr4mums> It might be kinda funny if that was a joke on his stream
[2023-01-06 00:43:49] <%+remixphoenix> are you thinking of doing a 2023 calendar?

[2023-01-06 00:44:10] <simiki3l> and you realize that simsie has subs to quite a few Sims streamers and some of them are like "she's probably never heard of us, she's going to be like üôÑ another one, but not really because she's too nice, but I'd be intimidated if she ever came in here."

[2023-01-06 00:53:21] <%$SimmerOnIce> @snowbunny2435 with UI cheats, you right click the moodlet. You can do it with MCCC, but its a bit more work

[2023-01-06 00:54:33] <e17ghora> the fear system should be reworked. If you don't realize whims or get a promotion in two days your sims gain fears which will make them miserable and unable to get what they want. And you might never get the chance to get rid of them without cheats

[2023-01-06 01:02:46] <%$holy_marisa> I wish I was able to have mods just for the added stress of risky woohoo
[2023-01-06 01:02:47] <+kennie329> this action will have consequences
[2023-01-06 01:02:47] <e17ghora> @lilsimsie I was wondering something for a while: you created the NotSoBerry challenge when the Loyal trait did not exist. Now, the loyal trait allows your sims to actually recognize being a cheater and feel guilty about it, which is kinda perfect for the blue generation of the challenge. What do you think about replacing one of the traits with Loyal?
[2023-01-06 01:02:50] <ImJakeDeason> realistic
[2023-01-06 01:02:52] <%42hitch42> Please consider the name Prunella

[2023-01-06 01:03:22] <%+wrensamphire> @bunteseinhorn135 someone has written a base game version, although the point of the challenge originally was to use things Kayla didn't use much. So pick any career you don't use much, although something social would suit the rose sim
[2023-01-06 01:03:31] <%42hitch42> and then things like this happen
[2023-01-06 01:03:31] <LauraPetrea> When are you playing dreamlight my valley again?
[2023-01-06 01:03:34] <%+WillowCreekWanderer> I always have it on 25%, it's so chaotic lol
[2023-01-06 01:03:38] <@%+MrsTomato101814> i keep it at 10 until my sims are adults and then i adjust it down, unless i forget
