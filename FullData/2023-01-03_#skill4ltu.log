[2023-01-03 14:31:10] <@%momix99> they renamed it for the event. its the same tank as T-32M
[2023-01-03 14:31:10] <%+simondo43> @skill4ltu t832 is tank name
[2023-01-03 14:31:11] <itsmatej1> you have everything on wargaming website

[2023-01-03 14:31:20] <%+magmar91> it is t-32m but renamed, like is-3a and peregrine
[2023-01-03 14:31:20] <%+bekerowski11> @skill4ltu the only way, WG could make more money, if you would get 30% coupon with normal BattlePass and 60% with better BattlePass, and you can only buy the Tnak if you complete the Full Marathon :D

[2023-01-03 14:31:32] <+vanato> T-832
[2023-01-03 14:31:32] <+Blegov> tank is t32m
[2023-01-03 14:31:32] <46sotos> heavy
[2023-01-03 14:31:37] <%Kubota26> probably it is Terminator version of T32m

[2023-01-03 14:36:20] <iusgaa> @pevitaha84 I think is a normal t-32 not M
[2023-01-03 14:36:21] <skeletor_overlordofevil> They posted news on webpage, if you want tank than pay 3500 gold for Improved Pass
[2023-01-03 14:36:28] <%Tankk1Poju> f2p player are content for paying customers. Thats how f2p games work.
[2023-01-03 14:36:33] <Xuecs> @skill4ltu you can also buy bundle that gives commander and 500 bonds for 3k gold
[2023-01-03 14:36:37] <+Easton216> 100% correct. WG will make the most money from people that don't have the time

[2023-01-03 14:57:42] <%NoaRyiKarOOzo> @bekerowski11 i played with that tank a lot. The turret is decent - the mantlet is deceptively thick and will protect you. The cupola is a noticable weakpoint. Play over a ridge with your hull covered and try to use the mobility to your advanatage. Medium distance skirmishes are usually in your favour this way.

[2023-01-03 15:03:08] <%powerpmp415> yes i have that too much often Skill i agree with you
[2023-01-03 15:03:09] <%Pisko_> that i hate RNG
[2023-01-03 15:03:11] <%skidder419> @skill4ltu while you were reading the pen question you shot in game and gave perfect example, you had green pen marker but bounced
[2023-01-03 15:03:18] <%KiLLaVuLKeN> @RisingReap what you are describing is 25% RNG, in world of tanks there is 25% RNG on your penetration, on shell distribution .. you can do everything right and the game will say no sometimes
[2023-01-03 15:03:26] <mrformotherland> title change?
[2023-01-03 15:03:28] <%old_stuff1976> good afternoon skill , how are you doing today m8
[2023-01-03 15:03:36] <%+Szulson> @skill4ltu On PC we will have t32 with 3d camo.. But Blitz will have M6 with 3d camoo.. soooo dont cry...
[2023-01-03 15:03:36] <+Blegov> question : is-5 or kv-4 kres or t-103 or 2 bond equip. considering i have like 40 t8 prems ?
[2023-01-03 15:03:40] <%NoaRyiKarOOzo> @skidder419 you never have a 100% guarantee that your shot lands exactly where u aim.
[2023-01-03 15:03:40] <CrumbMan> Green also doesn't mean 100% sure you're going to pen. I think it's 80%+ for green
[2023-01-03 15:03:46] <darkbrainnn> but if you sub to skill you get + 25 % rng
[2023-01-03 15:03:52] <Relyne> @skill4ltu crew 2.0 will nullify RNG a little bit

[2023-01-03 16:29:08] <C9ingLUL> without taking some care for the free players, who will the pay to play players have to queue with?
[2023-01-03 16:29:13] <ScaryDraganov> No pls skill, we already have such streamer xd
[2023-01-03 16:29:19] <%+Fherot> @skill4ltu you didn’t read any of my comments while I was watching 59G VOD.
[2023-01-03 16:29:24] <vesb0ss> Im afraid to say this, but its normal most of the businesses
[2023-01-03 16:29:28] <smudge_357> It would be like you making Index only for subs.
[2023-01-03 16:29:31] <C9ingLUL> it's especially a slap in the face following wg's most profitable month of the year - they couldn't bear to give away one tank to grinders kekw
[2023-01-03 16:29:32] <Johansson_88> @C9ingLUL the 200k players that migrated from CIS?

[2023-01-03 16:30:08] <%croeraser> @skill4ltu this T-832 is worst than tank with you now playing. I cannot see point to release this tank one month after you release BZ in game

[2023-01-03 16:30:10] <AlexFirdman> i believe it would be good to list reward tanks from previous years @skill4ltu

[2023-01-03 16:31:37] <Johansson_88> i think its more like they're releasing a camo for T32 that the fans will want

[2023-01-03 16:39:55] <%+Kumursga> voiceovers sh*t, tank is copy paste there is nothing to be excited for me
[2023-01-03 16:39:59] <%spagah123> @skill4ltu gangbanged by mosquitos
[2023-01-03 16:39:59] <%croeraser> @skill4ltu when you see last time wz114 in game :D some peoples mark it after marathon and thats it
[2023-01-03 16:40:00] <%+darelock_> Shame, WG finally started going in good direction and they do this shit. I guess they arent going all in with this idea so tank you get isnt as strong as other marathon tank like Progetto, EBR  or Renegade LUL @skill4ltu
[2023-01-03 16:40:01] <%+Fherot> @skill4ltu I have literally nothing else to spend Xmas gold on so I’ll have F2P peasants yelling at my terminator in game skilSellout
[2023-01-03 16:40:02] <MarckYrckx> Goooood afternoon people
[2023-01-03 16:40:03] <@%momix99> @kriskaem there is an official article and video on it
[2023-01-03 16:40:05] <%DisaBleed> @skill4ltu you mean 2023 :)
[2023-01-03 16:40:08] <NightKiller77> at least this tank has better traverse speed... not like the normal isu which is a nightmare
[2023-01-03 16:40:08] <%ModdernWarrfare> 2500 BP points in 14 days is a lot. Contemplating either skipping alt accounts or quitting job and taking up streaming full time
[2023-01-03 16:40:16] <SLAndrei89> projeto :)  centurion ax ...
[2023-01-03 16:40:17] <Aradas75> @skill4ltu last marathon I did was for the T-34-85M after that it was just too much grind
[2023-01-03 16:40:21] <Gepy_TV> best of them Progetto and bourasque
[2023-01-03 16:40:22] <Onderkruiper> Pretty sure you where busy with the game i was saying hi haha  :D   Im good at work atm. About to go home. How are you @skill4ltu
[2023-01-03 16:40:29] <MarckYrckx> How is it going today ?
[2023-01-03 16:40:41] <%croeraser> @skill4ltu when you see last time wz114 in game :D some peoples mark it after marathon and thats it

[2023-01-03 16:40:47] <rodrigopedro99> why lowe is not marked as 5 stars in begginer friendliness?
[2023-01-03 16:40:47] <BoNGoG_> @skill4ltu i mean i kinda get it why it is paylocked since it is a collaboration with the terminator and their publisher so the publisher prob is taking also something for it. but yeah they should put a better tank for the money

[2023-01-03 16:41:09] <imbo_21> what is this "weekly mission" in drop guys ?
[2023-01-03 16:41:12] <Justacrazyboy> What do you think would be vz 156 be able to be bought
[2023-01-03 16:41:15] <%Abyssal_Hawk> One thing I feel sad about, the ice age mode was so much fun... until games started filling with BZs
[2023-01-03 16:41:20] <%+Fherot> Atleast it’s just a copy paste tank not a new tank. Not all premiums are for free marathons so I don’t think it’s the end of the world

[2023-01-03 16:41:43] <%ModdernWarrfare> you guys are missing the point focusing on tank stats. This tank is definitely for collector feelings

[2023-01-03 16:42:13] <imbo_21> @momix99 Do you know what is the "weekly mission" in drops ?
[2023-01-03 16:42:24] <derp_skilz> its a decent tank, not every tank has to be an BZ. PLZ GOD NO
[2023-01-03 16:42:30] <bluecreap> and even than 99% of ppl would pay
[2023-01-03 16:42:32] <Tiplik1> wg needs cash for real war
[2023-01-03 16:42:32] <%Thorkell_the_great> First and not the last
[2023-01-03 16:42:38] <%+darelock_> @BoNGoG_ The opposite actually, they shouldnt put tank in improved pass at all, because its middle finger in community faces
[2023-01-03 16:42:39] <%+TastyLxD> WG will say it isn't marathon, it's battle pass Kappa @skill4ltu
[2023-01-03 16:42:39] <%Easneth> wasnt Shrek maraton the same?

[2023-01-03 16:42:56] <repejusteeri> @Easneth Shrek was free
[2023-01-03 16:42:56] <AlexFirdman> @skill4ltu don't forget it is BP, not marathon on paper
[2023-01-03 16:43:01] <%labrador_forever> skilHi
[2023-01-03 16:43:02] <%+slaiox> and whenever there is a first time, there will always be a second time
[2023-01-03 16:43:04] <%+Reavus1> @imbo_21 Mine is 2k spotting x 5 battles.
[2023-01-03 16:43:04] <ScaryDraganov> @skill4ltu  we all know how marathons are created so that in the end you have to pay  anyways to get the tank, not  many  peoole have the time to play WoT for  4-7 hours  for like 10 days everyday ...
[2023-01-03 16:43:08] <46sotos> @skill4ltu the future of wot they said in the youtube video..now i understand
[2023-01-03 16:43:14] <RagnarokPriest> I need a kick in my lazy ass to play game
[2023-01-03 16:43:14] <%+darelock_> @skill4ltu Tho Im still gonna grind that thing because free bounty equipment sounds like a good deal skilPog
[2023-01-03 16:43:15] <BoNGoG_> @BoNGoG_ yeah but if they want to do it then put a normal tank not a worse version of a free tank
[2023-01-03 16:43:17] <orange_7uice> skiiiiiil <3
[2023-01-03 16:43:19] <%jm7779> Agree with @skill4ltu on this one. Although I also remember the Obj. 780...
[2023-01-03 16:43:22] <%heeksterr> shrek was bp too
[2023-01-03 16:43:24] <orange_7uice> mano cukurukas :D
[2023-01-03 16:43:34] <%triton999> I don t give a shit abouT32M :P
[2023-01-03 16:43:34] <@%momix99> @imbo_21 this week its "Play 5 battles. Cause 2,000 HP of damage dealt and assisted (through spotting and immobilizing) in each battle"
[2023-01-03 16:43:36] <%+lionsandtigersandbearsomy> @skill4ltu do you think it will be large hours grind to finish?
[2023-01-03 16:43:44] <GoldbanLOL> the question also is, that how many F2P players were able to get the marathon tanks entirely for free, it took so much time, it was almost impossible
[2023-01-03 16:43:45] <watermelon3001> I always liked T32 and wished it was a premium. so for me it's a dream come true..
[2023-01-03 16:43:52] <uWoT404> i mean it doesnt matter if its a maraton or battle pass
[2023-01-03 16:43:54] <mervilx> @skill4ltu I'm one of those ppl - I would never finish a marathon but I'm angry :)
[2023-01-03 16:43:54] <%+klecha_> I prefered normal marathons tho
[2023-01-03 16:43:54] <d3pzaizai> excuse my stupid question, but wasn't the ShPTK-TVP 100 grind the same? or did I miss something? @skill4ltu
[2023-01-03 16:43:59] <%+leotz1> oficial instagram post says "battlepass come with a new look"
[2023-01-03 16:44:00] <%+FaFaManso> 2023 same shit correct
[2023-01-03 16:44:00] <+akkeroni> @skill4ltu need 2 shots for 800damage? what a joke of a tank

[2023-01-03 16:44:18] <+Z_e_f_i_x_x_W_i_x_x> the curious thing about the Packages you can purchase for the Battle Pass is 3 times each package thats greedy do you agree ?! otvLOL  @skill4ltu

[2023-01-03 16:44:28] <%ModdernWarrfare> I think shrek was 30 days
[2023-01-03 16:44:35] <%Lexa4RU> @d3pzaizai it was a bp marathon as well, but you could get the tank for free, the 3d skin needed to buy improved pass
[2023-01-03 16:44:35] <+Xard86> shtpk has 40 stages

[2023-01-03 16:45:40] <alexveldor> never again buy any premium tank
[2023-01-03 16:45:40] <RagnarokPriest> but you must complete 3 base stages of battle pass to get in to 4 stage

[2023-01-03 16:45:59] <%+Eastfront87> i dont see the prob...if anyone want something special in the game, u need some money...all the others can play the classic tech tree tanks...
[2023-01-03 16:46:02] <Moslav4c> its not about marathon, they want gold you got from boxes :) 14 days, 50 stages... 3.500 gold for improoved and 250 per stage
[2023-01-03 16:46:03] <%+Nasdasdy> @skill4ltuis this correct? NA says: Battle Pass Judgement Day is 50 Stages for 14 Days???

[2023-01-03 16:46:13] <%+screen07> @skill4ltu hopefully they add the T56 again either on shop, for gold or on a battle pass tank reward. I need to get my hands on this tank :(
[2023-01-03 16:46:19] <Biashi> The factor of "preparing" before that marathone was the key. We prepared a lot of VI-tiers tanks with almost completed limit of points and took the tank easy.

[2023-01-03 19:46:15] <e5tonianguy> @skill4ltu it actually works like this: all cars have heated seats from factory(it costs them less to produce it so) and if you then wish to use heated seats you have options- either full lifetime or periodically.
[2023-01-03 19:46:18] <%Rozenstein> @skill4ltu MERCEDES: you can pay 1200$/year to get better acceleration. That's some WG shenanigans right there...

[2023-01-03 19:47:07] <%bunikutza> cant write to other twitch
[2023-01-03 19:47:11] <%$ItsVojta> It's because to producea car with everything is cheaper than produce multiple variants of a car. But they should jus tsell it as a whole. Monthly suscribtion is just ridiculous @skill4ltu

[2023-01-03 19:47:48] <Depesz87> Imagine if the gun of the tank was a real you know pixel, when you cant drive into the wall, or do and damage it or destroy it even
[2023-01-03 19:48:15] <desmundolesmundo> @Ekamdu I know that, I was responding to @MadisonOne who said 'you literally buy gold for money, your argument is nonsense'

[2023-01-03 19:48:44] <%$MisterTerpene> So, if I wanted, could I simply pay higher retail price for heated seats and never bother about subscription?
[2023-01-03 19:48:52] <%$ItsVojta> It's like you say. If you dont like it, dont buy it. I'm still happily using my 2004 corsa and I'm having a blast while driving skilHa @skill4ltu

[2023-01-03 20:14:11] <GODrums> it's revenue, not profit
[2023-01-03 20:14:13] <%Scowler> @skill4ltu net worth is around $5 billion in 2022

[2023-01-03 20:14:22] <instructornooblet> Quote: Twitch generated approximately $2.6 billion revenue in 2021, a 41% year-on-year increase.
[2023-01-03 20:14:25] <+FDeWit> increases by 40% each year -- correct

[2023-01-03 20:14:33] <SphinxColdhand> Twitter was loosing money
[2023-01-03 20:14:46] <+DriemLaif> one year revenue is not a lot, sale price would include multiple years revenue

[2023-01-03 21:01:10] <@%Basleader92> @jonaszch if the armor is 40MM you need a gun of 121MM to overmatch it, gun caliber needs to be 3times higher than the armor and you will always pen if you shoot with AP/APCR

[2023-01-03 21:34:53] <TheFallen93> @skill4ltu yeah Mr. Baboon, but i think if they simply lower the pen of the shells could also help a lot, because BZ has good pen, good armor and almost no weak spot from front :O its horrible to play against :O

[2023-01-03 21:37:31] <%Nash0409> I agree Wg should nerf BZ BUT, Wg is on a policy that they nőt nerf prems. so they now fájt do that bc the y would fuck the little trust that they have now. imo Wg van make a state that from now on every tank that they Dell van be nerfed or so
[2023-01-03 21:37:42] <%+matzoch> im happy when i get 52% and I've got around 1750WN8, i am not the worst player i'd say
[2023-01-03 21:37:46] <Jackanator44> @skill4ltu but yet they make obj 283 impossible to get even tho its not near as good as BZ

[2023-01-03 21:37:47] <TheFallen93> @skill4ltu maybe thats only my opinion, but i think the players are already frustrated most of the time and this tank (BZ) also causing frustration when you play against it...its a bad way from WG

[2023-01-03 21:40:52] <%+007jackass> @skill4ltu I never buy the loot boxes as I feel its a bit of a rip off. I bought 12 boxes because I thought I will try it, I got 3000 gold a t4 and t3 premium 15 days of premium and the char 75. I think WG did it so I spend more money!
[2023-01-03 21:41:01] <@%Basleader92> @Johansson_88 true, but for lots of people WoT is a hobby and they don't mind spending money on it, nothing wrong with that IMO

[2023-01-03 21:41:53] <Johansson_88> @Basleader92 yeah thats fine, im more wondering why spend 2k on boxes instead of just waiitng for the pixels to come in shop and buy them for 50€
[2023-01-03 21:41:59] <sheldor454> i know a premium tank that was nerfed

[2023-01-03 21:42:52] <%Mykthos> WTF... is a 14 days 50 stages BP?
[2023-01-03 21:42:54] <%+magnetic38> the only way I have seen a nerf to premium tanks is power creep
[2023-01-03 21:42:55] <%+007jackass> @mrpsychodad normally I am very unlucky but I think that £18 paid itself off. do you normally buy boxes and get some good stuff?
[2023-01-03 21:42:57] <%gegrion> BZ was nerfed , on the test his alpha was 1200 and he could be submarine.
[2023-01-03 21:42:58] <@%Basleader92> @Johansson_88 boxes is a gamble for the tanks, but you still get gold and premium days etc, so it's not a bad investment (Last time I bought boxes I got enough gold/prem days to last an entire year without worry)

[2023-01-03 21:43:53] <xVonixYT> I think it's q justified attitude. If I buy a $80 on loot boxex to get Bz, I don't want it nerfed because of the perception of the vocal playerbase

[2023-01-03 22:07:41] <%DisaBleed> @skill4ltu if people want to play free to play and get premium i would recommend them to play tournaments on wot page and earn gold like that

[2023-01-03 22:07:50] <winny_warrior> I'm well too but a bit bz invasion

[2023-01-03 22:08:24] <%+007jackass> @jackanator44 and the accuracy seems crap as well

[2023-01-03 22:10:37] <%$Solzen12> I guess the British prefer to store their ammo in the front of the tank so they have a quick and explosive death.

[2023-01-03 22:11:44] <%+eagletroop> @maxvhck because different ammoracks have different amount of hp so for example a ammorack on e3 is 440 health and u have carn gun 240 alpha you have to hit same spot and than u might ammorack e3 but a skorp g will hit it and take all e3 ammorack hp

[2023-01-03 22:12:43] <%+eagletroop> @maxvhck with carn gun you have to hit same spot twice to damage ammorack and that’s rng based and setting  fire and damaging ammorack is excluded from this

[2023-01-03 22:20:59] <@%Basleader92> @willarddog if you play a lot and have the money, sure go for it, if you just play once in a while then it's not worth it IMO

[2023-01-03 22:21:27] <!ScorpianyTheGOAT> @Ganzorig_so Spaced armor doesn't guarantee that it blocks HEAT. It just reduces the pen of shells much more quickly.

[2023-01-03 22:34:57] <!%ScorpianyTheGOAT> @laczko97 To clarify, WG is making 2 major changes. Not only is every crew going to come as 100% as default, but each crew will work for 3 tanks at the same time. So any crews you train will be way more useful later this year than any current crew.

[2023-01-03 22:59:30] <antonis360r> have you used improved aiming device on skoda Skill????

[2023-01-03 23:07:44] <%warbeastn> I hate how they make it hard for casual player to complete marathons for tanks
[2023-01-03 23:07:46] <@%Basleader92> kinda makes sense though, I mean it would be weird to give a tier 8 premium just for logging in @skill4ltu LUL
[2023-01-03 23:07:48] <%Gwingdk> @skill4ltu Question, If I have replay where a platoon clearly is rigging the game, should it be send to you and where?

[2023-01-03 23:08:25] <+Silvianule> @skill4ltu Comparing to the kebab store, would a kebab store sell expired food just that would make people sick just to make more money? Like these tanks make matchmaking "sick".
[2023-01-03 23:08:26] <gideon_an> If I get enough bonds should I get the Charlemagne? Seems kinda underwhelming.
