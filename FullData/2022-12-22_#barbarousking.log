[2022-12-22 03:13:11] <%+Corking118> @Corso117 you're given about two dozen different ways to turn up difficulty. you can add a timer, or add more enemies, or give enemies extra damage/powers......
[2022-12-22 03:13:12] <LarryPaul2> only 63 so far
[2022-12-22 03:13:14] <%+JamminTee> not super easy when you start but you get much stronger. Heat makes it so you can match enemies power with your skill level.

[2022-12-22 03:21:19] <%higHChloride> @Mr_SelfDestrukt I'll agree that the first one is clunky, but i think at the time games like that were clunky, if almost pridefully so. I'll concede I have nostalgia about it and that it's probably not the best of games. The Witcher 2, on the other hand, I feel is where the game and story found their balance. It's similar to Mass Effect 2, which I also feel found its zenith there.

[2022-12-22 03:49:16] <%CarbonAxiom> @clan_the_galka Nintendo really lowered their requirements to get on the store in the Switch era. I'm guessing it's because they knew how much of the indie game market share they can take if they do

[2022-12-22 15:47:25] <%flipvanmorritz> I think to thematically be a western there needs to be an element regarding the environment, the setting in which the events take place, it's on the edge of civilization where the rules are blurry

[2022-12-22 15:56:47] <%+ghidorahsfury> Bullet Train was fun, with Brad Pitt
[2022-12-22 15:56:49] <%+Assertonsin> it pisses me off that every movie nowadays needs to have some comedy relief
[2022-12-22 15:56:50] <%$SeratiDood> I liked the premise of die hard 4 in terms of story. But the overall execution was really bad
[2022-12-22 15:56:50] <%+kacyraeclark> Violent Night was fantastic.
[2022-12-22 15:56:52] <%+mokinooch> it was violent and it had a nod to home alone

[2022-12-22 15:58:27] <%grognardish> The violent risky stuff is now on TV, movies are now too expensive to be allowed to risk

[2022-12-22 15:58:42] <%LostHopeFate> I'm going to tell you to watch The Raid 2 every day until you've watched it
[2022-12-22 15:58:43] <%d1vinezer0> @barbarousking Sadly Bruce Willis can't act anymore. He's got some illness making it hard to remember his lines. They had to cut a large chunk for a recent movie.

[2022-12-22 15:59:24] <%flipvanmorritz> Ridley Scott is an arsehole who famously makes one decent to good film for every 3 he actually creates.

[2022-12-22 16:06:26] <%acid1013> there goes that twist
[2022-12-22 16:06:26] <%+XLVIItheRoman> Terminator 2 led to the hardest arcade/SNES game i've ever played
[2022-12-22 16:06:30] <+Laila_X> Terminator 2 WAS AWESOME :]
[2022-12-22 16:06:30] <%Putkavahti> Spoilers! D:
[2022-12-22 16:06:31] <$AceZer0187> I still like Terminator 1 more, but 2 is very good

[2022-12-22 16:06:44] <%w1steria> what about two brothers
[2022-12-22 16:06:44] <%+Greybeardragon> T1 was first r rated movie in theater for me. So good
[2022-12-22 16:06:45] <davetrain14> Do you like Taken?
[2022-12-22 16:06:46] <OctavianWolfbane> but then again, I was too young to have watched it in the cinemas
[2022-12-22 16:06:48] <%doctor_hen_dogg> I miss the era when movies were good lmao
[2022-12-22 16:06:49] <rhyn_art> thanks barb... spoilers much
[2022-12-22 16:06:51] <%+ghidorahsfury> The most important aspect of action movies is body mass. Gotta tack on mass!
[2022-12-22 16:06:51] <Oleai> I like Alien more than Aliens but both are good. Same situation
[2022-12-22 16:06:51] <%DoctorBlowfly> T2 is one of the best sequels ever
[2022-12-22 16:06:53] <%acid1013> like if MNIGHT mentioned Bruce Willis was a ghost in the preview
[2022-12-22 16:06:53] <%alucard835> I had never seen Terminator movies til recently, I really enjoyed the tension of T1
[2022-12-22 16:06:53] <%$sillyhatman> t1 and t2 are such wildly different movies.
[2022-12-22 16:06:53] <%+breadwatcher> you learn that arnold is a good guy pretty early on in the movie, at least. its not like a major plot twist at the end or anything
[2022-12-22 16:06:53] <%$Xel562> fucking trailers, ruining movies since who knows
[2022-12-22 16:06:54] <+UraniumQ33> What about the first to Alien movies?
[2022-12-22 16:06:54] <%PAm5089> @XLVIItheRoman No joke, that game was so hard

[2022-12-22 16:07:00] <%$BrassRabbit> boobies in t1
[2022-12-22 16:07:00] <%GarbageTown> T1 and T2 are practically different genres.
[2022-12-22 16:07:01] <%acewing216> T1 is a solid horror movie
[2022-12-22 16:07:02] <kuronayao> T2 was the first I saw, so I like it more
[2022-12-22 16:07:02] <hotwheel912> hey santa
[2022-12-22 16:07:02] <%$Pillaging_Pig> Biull Paxton was fantastic
[2022-12-22 16:07:03] <%+yooper8246> Well the majority of the movie shows Arnold as the good guy
[2022-12-22 16:07:03] <%+kingbrosgameplay> i watched dark vate and laugh so hard mid film on how bad it is.
[2022-12-22 16:07:03] <%+Sorry4HavingFun> @AceZer0187 i feel like its an Alien/Aliens situation where they are both amazing movies and its fine to like one over the other either way
[2022-12-22 16:07:05] <%+solidpeyo> best action actor Arnold schwarzenegger vs Sylvester Stallone?
[2022-12-22 16:07:05] <%+liquidpariah> I remember when they tried to act like Arnold making that bike jump in T2 was the greatest stunt of all time.
[2022-12-22 16:07:05] <%SkoSoSy> I didn‚Äôt know that, that sucks. It would‚Äôve been so much better to not know and find out when he shows up in the mall to save him

[2022-12-22 16:07:32] <%Lika_sika> I like James Cameron when he is 3000 feet in the ocean
[2022-12-22 16:07:33] <%+Dr_Seaword> James Cameron has turned into an egomaniacle prick

[2022-12-22 16:07:39] <%jollyball77> enough to make more I guess
[2022-12-22 16:07:40] <%$DekeOfHazzard> that's like Disney and making star wars content in the Skywalker era. just stop
[2022-12-22 16:07:40] <%lamda00> for real how many reboots we need
[2022-12-22 16:07:41] <kuronayao> enough
[2022-12-22 16:07:42] <%+AnimusAja> The only old franchise that's shown it has any potential with new films is Predator. Prey was so good.

[2022-12-22 16:07:42] <+Rampage923> Titanic 2: Return of the Iceberg

[2022-12-22 16:07:49] <Crack_Eggs> agree
[2022-12-22 16:07:51] <Oleai> Alien is one of my favorite horror movies

[2022-12-22 16:07:53] <%alucard835> Alien NODDERS
[2022-12-22 16:07:54] <%acid1013> terminator HAS to be losing money for the last two movies
[2022-12-22 16:07:54] <%jollyball77> Alien 3 could have been good
[2022-12-22 16:07:54] <PontiFlexer> it aint much, but its guaranteed income
[2022-12-22 16:07:55] <+salsapicantetv> i want more alien!

[2022-12-22 16:08:09] <%meetreality> The film industry of 1 off's and the likes are dead. It's all franchise movies or trying to bring back old classics
[2022-12-22 16:08:09] <MyDearestEnemy> Even Alien 3 is passable
[2022-12-22 16:08:10] <%MisterPyxl> barbHi
[2022-12-22 16:08:11] <%meetreality> So dumb

[2022-12-22 16:08:11] <+EhgentOrange> ill never forget when the first alien movie came out
[2022-12-22 16:08:12] <%Cathuriges> I like alien 4
[2022-12-22 16:08:12] <%architect37> Cameron should focus on the Avatar franchise instead
[2022-12-22 16:08:14] <skepticaljesus> which was the Alien movie with Winona Ryder?
[2022-12-22 16:08:15] <%$mr_dubie> Arnold Schwarzenegger wanted to do the Austrian dub of Terminator 2 but they wouldn't let him because his accent is considered back woods
[2022-12-22 16:08:15] <ChrisStoll> What about prometheus?
[2022-12-22 16:08:16] <%+TalonXV> I love the books in the Aliens IP, it makes me angry no good movies have came out since Aliens when they had so much author fiction to work with
[2022-12-22 16:08:17] <Screegar> Alien 3 Assembly Cut is great
[2022-12-22 16:08:21] VIEWERS: 3¬†997
[2022-12-22 16:08:21] <%+vintagerudy> T2 and Aliens are the best action movies
[2022-12-22 16:08:21] <%$mprziv> They mostly come at night, mostly.
[2022-12-22 16:08:21] <%valse_01> new ideas, new IPs...please
[2022-12-22 16:08:21] <%scarbo87> Alien franchise should stay where it is
[2022-12-22 16:08:21] <%snoops_kush> Alien 3 and Resurrection are serviceable
[2022-12-22 16:08:21] <%+XLVIItheRoman> there's definitely some franchises that could stand to have a 'spiritual reboot'
[2022-12-22 16:08:22] <%+heyitsnovabound> alien is genre defining for its time

[2022-12-22 16:08:25] <%alucard835> Prometheus I felt had the potential to tie in some cool Alien shit and they fumbled hard
[2022-12-22 16:08:26] <%scarbo87> Aliens was fucking sick
[2022-12-22 16:08:26] <%kumakumaman> Alien 1 swept the oscars and changed popular perception that both horror and sci-fi couldnt be high brow oscar bait
[2022-12-22 16:08:27] <TheMightyTwizz> prometheus could have been so good...but it wasn't
[2022-12-22 16:08:27] <%+solidpeyo> DESKCHAN
[2022-12-22 16:08:27] <%w1steria> Alien is the best movie about looking for a cat

[2022-12-22 16:23:30] <%+uupop> I love how genichiro turns from "unbeatable" first boss to pushover first phase of the final boss, and the only real change is the player's skill
[2022-12-22 16:23:30] <%Yurizo007> still can't do old owl for true end tho XD
[2022-12-22 16:23:36] <@%$DanTheVP> Yeah Dark Souls trains you to wait, and wait, and wait. Sekiro gives you the power to just Attack and be agreesive
[2022-12-22 16:23:38] <%DemiDeltas> @BonfireOfHope is it not? it says it starts today and theres a page for it
[2022-12-22 16:23:39] <%+solidpeyo> yeah Genishiro is like the point where the game clicks

[2022-12-22 16:28:22] <%Adampalooza85> my first was dark souls 2. almost turned me off to all fromsoft games

[2022-12-22 16:28:32] <+wilelock> Most from soft games get easier as they go on, with the first sections the hardest
[2022-12-22 16:28:35] <%+PatrickoftheIsles> This level reminds me of the Crypt of the necrodancer GDQ relay level. Those were so good

[2022-12-22 16:28:50] <%retrofox_13> Elden ring first, went to ds1, not a fan. But I‚Äôll finish the series
[2022-12-22 16:28:52] <%VinceVal> fist was demon's souls on ps3. i banged my head against the wall until i beat it and have loved souls games since

[2022-12-22 16:29:11] <%$GameFillip> kept getting lost in bloodborne, stuck with it and it was a ton of fun

[2022-12-22 16:29:15] <%scarbo87> Old question but how is Elden Ring in terms of 'getting into' the DS range of games
[2022-12-22 16:29:22] <%+breadwatcher> @retrofox_13 yeah going from ER to DS1 is hard to do. ER is so refined comparatively
[2022-12-22 16:29:24] <%+uupop> Bloodborne hasn't clicked for me, even after multiple attempts. I want to push through because I only hear great things
[2022-12-22 16:29:24] <%+solidpeyo> DS3 is harder than 1
[2022-12-22 16:29:26] <%DemiDeltas> hoping ds3 and sekrio go on sale, i have them on launch day xbox1 but that thing doesnt run well anymore

[2022-12-22 16:29:37] <%$TheMuznick> Bloodborne among one of my favorites in the franchise, close second to Elden Ring. Elden Ring wins out just because of the size and scope
[2022-12-22 16:29:37] <buypurpleflurp> Dark Souls 1 has much harder areas and runbacks than the later games
[2022-12-22 16:29:38] <%+seedmole> even Vordt is more of a boss than almost anything from ds1

[2022-12-22 16:31:20] <+wilelock> Arguably the run back is part of the boss

[2022-12-22 16:34:18] <Teezull> man I did not like DS2 at all lol
[2022-12-22 16:34:21] <%VinceVal> DS2 just the worst of the series period
[2022-12-22 16:34:23] <%MinisterGold> black mulch...

[2022-12-22 16:34:29] <KnusperBKN> The second smelter demon runback is pain.
[2022-12-22 16:34:30] <%SquallGCS> is it worth going back to play DS2 at all? I skipped it when it came out

[2022-12-22 16:34:35] <%$ChickenLobotomy> Demon souls has pretty bad runback too
[2022-12-22 16:34:41] <%jollyball77> Regular Smelter Demon is bad too
[2022-12-22 16:34:44] <%happy_axe> also dont leave bloodborne out, some big oof runbacks there tbh
[2022-12-22 16:34:45] <%+uupop> I hated the old hero runback in demon souls

[2022-12-22 16:34:55] <@%$DanTheVP> My biggest complaint with every Souls game that isnt Sekiro is that the Cool Story parts happen first, then you play the game in the aftermath
[2022-12-22 16:34:55] <%StenchLingerfield> bruh darklurker ohnoo. that shit was ass
[2022-12-22 16:35:03] <%GnastyGnork_> @GnastyGnork_ fuck yeah I know what I'm watching when the stream is over
[2022-12-22 16:35:06] <%$scrap_hearts> insane level
[2022-12-22 16:35:09] <%luigi_sama7> tower knight run back blows
[2022-12-22 16:35:17] <%Rosisson> SquallGCS maybe, I liked it more than DS1 but like DS2 the game is clunky
[2022-12-22 16:35:20] <%+seedmole> i love sekiro's story, gives hints of Rashomon
[2022-12-22 16:35:25] <%$Wafflum> the Chariot is an amazingly awful run back, especially on NG+
[2022-12-22 16:35:25] <%s0ulmaster07> afternoon y'all barbLove
[2022-12-22 16:35:30] <%ArmoredKori> I've always described the Souls games as walking through a museum and where you eventually fight the artists
[2022-12-22 16:35:33] <%Cronny> nito runback
[2022-12-22 16:35:37] <%Anster123> Would Sekiro be a good first souls-like game?
[2022-12-22 16:35:39] <%atty2> s0ulmaster07 peepoHappy /
[2022-12-22 16:35:40] <@%$DanTheVP> @ArmoredKori That is pretty apt
[2022-12-22 16:35:40] <%$kevincostnerino> Barb's first Sekiro playthrough is my fav Youtube series of any game/streamer.
[2022-12-22 16:35:41] [Notification] starstorm_alpha subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 35 months, currently on a 35 month streak! [getting triggered thinking about the DS2 runbacks]
[2022-12-22 16:35:47] <%shiny_dubwool> Sekiro has checkpoints like right outside most bosses thankfully
[2022-12-22 16:35:49] <%ARKtm> LUL
[2022-12-22 16:35:52] <%SquallGCS> @Rosisson thanks
[2022-12-22 16:35:52] <%atty2> KEKW
[2022-12-22 16:35:52] <MeekMogwin> I can't think of a single challenging runback in Elden Ring, everything is right there.
[2022-12-22 16:35:57] <%$MontyMoonwalker> next fromsoft is all a swamp world
[2022-12-22 16:35:59] <%+xImNotToast> Is a runback the distance between the boss and a bonfire?
[2022-12-22 16:35:59] <%CarbonAxiom> @Anster123 It's not really a soulslike. It's very much it's own thing, so it won't help with the other Fromsoft games
[2022-12-22 16:36:03] <%+solidpeyo> I glad they are taking a break on the souls formula with armored core
[2022-12-22 16:36:04] <%deadlast13> the shadows of yharnam runback made me stop playing the game for a while
[2022-12-22 16:36:10] <firstnamebutt> are you going to play high on life
[2022-12-22 16:36:10] <%VinceVal> @MeekMogwin renala and placidusax are 2 of them
[2022-12-22 16:36:20] <OctavianWolfbane> lol that don't bullshit alert
[2022-12-22 16:36:20] <ConnSnow> Just got my Elden Ring plat moving on to get my DS3 plat next!
[2022-12-22 16:36:22] <%$FengWeiWay> oh yea lol
[2022-12-22 16:36:22] <%+Garnix_99> at this point just put in a retry option tbh
[2022-12-22 16:36:23] <%DemiDeltas> i was thinking about getting myself a ps5 for christmas but the only games i would play on it is GoW and bloodborne
[2022-12-22 16:36:31] VIEWERS: 4¬†376
[2022-12-22 16:36:31] <%Anster123> @carbonaxiom good to know, I‚Äôll probably pick it up then for the winter sale barbSuffer
[2022-12-22 16:36:32] <%JHammon67> Do you think there's a good amount of runback, or there just should be none?
[2022-12-22 16:36:34] <+Zombizzzle> I saw another streamer complain about them removing the run backs because it makes finding shortcuts useless. I‚Äôd take that trade off any day
[2022-12-22 16:36:36] <%MinisterGold> i remember in high school, my cousins and I used to use ebaums world to make prank calls with an Arnold soundboard
[2022-12-22 16:36:36] <%$trudenter> There original plan was to have perma death for souls
[2022-12-22 16:36:38] <%happy_axe> compared to the older games they are nothing LUL
[2022-12-22 16:36:44] <%$Dracoraz> nokron gargoyles also come to mind
[2022-12-22 16:36:50] <%+breadwatcher> @DemiDeltas dude same. i cant justify the purchase because of how few games there are for it that i care to play.
[2022-12-22 16:36:52] <%simms56> Demon souls run backs are meh
[2022-12-22 16:36:52] <%7amdon> @deadlast123 wasnt there an elevator the opposite way?
[2022-12-22 16:37:02] <%$Blastphemy1290> I gave up on trying to buy a PS5, not enough console games to make it worth it over PC
[2022-12-22 16:37:04] <%+CakeBearer> I don't mind that either
[2022-12-22 16:37:06] <%$kevincostnerino> @DemiDeltas Returnal!
[2022-12-22 16:37:07] <%$StandingYon> Exactly
[2022-12-22 16:37:10] <%flipvanmorritz> blue smelter was un fucking believable

[2022-12-22 16:37:23] <%The_Ice__> orphan of kos has one of those i think
[2022-12-22 16:37:25] <blueskytreb82> I havent found the 4 Kings shortcut yet Sadge
[2022-12-22 16:37:25] <%$Dracoraz> @Dracoraz actually I guess there's a stake iirc so nevermind
[2022-12-22 16:37:28] <%+TheGreatWalrusini> get back to a boss that one shots you lol
[2022-12-22 16:37:29] <%shiny_dubwool> Ancient Dragon's worse because it's so easy to just run past but still so long
[2022-12-22 16:37:30] <%ethanrmc> ancient dragon was so awful for so many reasons KEKW
[2022-12-22 16:37:34] <%+neverhadfun1> Also some run the ef away.
[2022-12-22 16:37:35] <%+solidpeyo> Demon's Souls have shortcuts
[2022-12-22 16:37:35] <%CarbonAxiom> @DemiDeltas Yeah, play Returnal if you get it
[2022-12-22 16:37:37] <%$StandingYon> Or Placidusax - just gotta lay down haha
[2022-12-22 16:37:39] <%+AnimusAja> To be fair, Ancient Dragon is also not supposed to be fought, by default.
[2022-12-22 16:37:40] <+Zombizzzle> Good point
[2022-12-22 16:37:42] <albanaster> all the co-op bosses have hell run backs because theyre meant to be done with friends
[2022-12-22 16:37:45] <%+breadwatcher> @DemiDeltas yeah thats on the list of like 3 games that i'd want the ps5 for. and im not gonna spend hundreds ofdollars for it
[2022-12-22 16:37:53] <%+TheMilkman993> I think run backs with an elevator are the worst
[2022-12-22 16:37:58] <%DemiDeltas> returnal is coming to PC though
[2022-12-22 16:37:59] <%Murray_05> DS1 also has horrible runbacks: Nito, four kings, seath
[2022-12-22 16:38:01] <%$Nave_212> :)
[2022-12-22 16:38:01] <%deadlast13> shortcuts are satisfying to find too
[2022-12-22 16:38:02] <%$TheMuznick> Ancient Dragon in Dark Souls 2 was terrible, what made the run back worse was the fact that ancient dragon is basically a one hit and takes forever to kill
[2022-12-22 16:38:05] <%jollyball77> the Shadows of Yharnam runback has shortcuts and it still sucks
[2022-12-22 16:38:10] <%CarbonAxiom> I wish I had found the secret grace next to the Godskins
[2022-12-22 16:38:11] <baba_oreilly42> Hi barb
[2022-12-22 16:38:15] <%flipvanmorritz> I couldn't believe there WASN'T any kind of shortcut for blue smelter
[2022-12-22 16:38:16] <%$kevincostnerino> @DemiDeltas Yeah I totally get that, haha. I just thought Returnal deserved to be mentioned. 0)
[2022-12-22 16:38:19] <%Count_de_Ville> Manus runback says hi 4Head
[2022-12-22 16:38:24] <Dardonax1> Is there anything to be said for the challenge of having to re-defeat full sets of enemies before fighting the boss?
[2022-12-22 16:38:24] <grgoncal> gwyn runback is the worst
[2022-12-22 16:38:29] <%VinceVal> through black knights and shit too
[2022-12-22 16:38:31] <itscaw> To make each fight more tense

[2022-12-22 16:38:42] <%LightOfTheIronSausage> There is an argument that the runback adds stakes to beating the boss... it's a bad one, but it's an argument
[2022-12-22 16:38:43] <%$TheMuznick> in Dark Souls 1, nothing is worse than the Bed of Chaos runback

[2022-12-22 18:20:31] <%+GaimeGuy> Snakes on a Plane was fun

[2022-12-22 18:25:47] <IAmAralias> Name of the Wind is allowed to be wordy when the prose is as good as it is. Rothfuss does words good.

[2022-12-22 18:26:09] <%O_Luke> I disliked Name of the Wind. It felt like such a ripoff of A Wizard of Earthsea, except it never went anywhere.

[2022-12-22 18:26:18] <Dardonax1> I still need to read the Wheel of Time books, myself. But I've heard one of the best parts is that all the extensive details provided are actually foreshadowing events that will happen 7 books later.

[2022-12-22 20:11:36] <brcoutme> @Salcium77 ares applies doom which does a bunch of damage after a short delay, while Dionysus inflicts 'hangover' which is basically poison and does a little continuous damage over time. Notably hangover can be stacked while (without a specific additional boon) doom cannot.
