[2022-12-22 18:25:55] <%psychictoad_> 3 ults to kill you? what makes you think that
[2022-12-22 18:25:55] <+BamaMophi> I’m glad Smite doesn’t have Pokémon Unite’s buff mechanic where killing someone with a buff gives you the remaining duration of their buff
[2022-12-22 18:25:57] <@%MichaelxVoorheees> 2k gold up, lost 1 fight

[2022-12-22 18:26:38] <+BamaMophi> @sorakingbased He’s ok rn. Nothing crazy, but definitely not bad
[2022-12-22 18:26:41] <%Danger_Corpse> @sorakingbased I think he's a squirrel. That's my opinion.
