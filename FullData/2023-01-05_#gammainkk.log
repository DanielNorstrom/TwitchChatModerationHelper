[2023-01-05 12:47:43] <%umbra_sky1> honestly im not sure myself. i just use them to find it out
[2023-01-05 12:47:54] <astutere> that was last week's I think
[2023-01-05 12:47:56] <%umbra_sky1> look at the easy 80points if you dont care for the summer attire
[2023-01-05 12:48:17] <%umbra_sky1> you need to do the 100pts for 6 weeks if you want the summer glam tho
[2023-01-05 12:48:20] <%$kiriosthanatos> think thats last weeks
[2023-01-05 12:48:30] <astutere> they probably haven't gotten the solution yet because it resets on tuesday
[2023-01-05 12:48:38] <%umbra_sky1> idk i used their bot from discord to get it
[2023-01-05 12:48:38] <%$kiriosthanatos> kaiyoko does it on friday
[2023-01-05 12:48:58] <%umbra_sky1> ohh gotcha
[2023-01-05 12:48:58] <+BritishTrashPanda> 80 points are needed for the max MGP. 100 points gets you the schievement the first time you do it.

[2023-01-05 14:36:51] <%$kiriosthanatos> its the importance of balance, even light is dangerous if theres too much of it
[2023-01-05 14:36:51] <AtrophyAtomic> its alot deeper than than that but you get the idea
[2023-01-05 14:37:20] <+SaberAkamine> Light and Darkness are not either inherently bad. Too much of one or the other leads to disaster or the death of a star. there needs to be balance.

[2023-01-05 16:57:52] <%umbra_sky1> in theory if you finish it you get a more indept CS toward the end
[2023-01-05 16:58:06] <%umbra_sky1> @scrub1ey it is now but if she had taken the quest before she has to finish it
[2023-01-05 16:58:09] <+Tarius_Hal> yea the lvl 50 crystal tower needs to be done immediately
