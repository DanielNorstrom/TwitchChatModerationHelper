[2023-01-05 18:12:56] <$pablito_elmatador> gilberto is low on form, and the other option is the oldie Andr√© Almeida

[2023-01-05 18:14:46] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> I cant believe how cheap some Bundes midfielders are. Demirbay is almost the perfect "low average" player who could massively overperform.
[2023-01-05 18:14:53] <+ForTheK1ng> Saka with the pens is big too
[2023-01-05 18:14:58] <$pablito_elmatador> i know what you mean, but bah is getting the spot, and sometimes he gets the left corners, and utility on champions league and internacional gws
[2023-01-05 18:14:59] <%+adamo419> Martinelli as your extra?
[2023-01-05 18:15:23] <$pablito_elmatador> i would sell any other player that doesnt have those upsides
[2023-01-05 18:15:33] <+tsgator2001> This seems like a ton of info to try to keep up with. How many leagues do you track?
[2023-01-05 18:15:33] <%+reece_1995> it's why I'm thinking of a Scottish stack, know the league and there looks the be alotbof value there.
[2023-01-05 18:15:40] <@%$ItsTr3ple> I would make a killing with a Marseille stack
[2023-01-05 18:15:48] <RicardoC__88> Check Casper Tengstedt, youngster that scores a decent amount of goals
[2023-01-05 18:15:49] <yehonatan_garji> Have you seen what happened in Villareal 2? Iker Alvarez (Andora international team starting GK) will probably be the #1 GK from now on (U23 - 2026) because Rulli left and J√∂rgensen is going on the bench for the main team

[2023-01-05 18:16:03] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> I genuinely think thats why theres premiums on the big scorers from big teams. So much easier to find info on them
[2023-01-05 18:16:28] <%whufcconnor> some of the lesser known teams have cheap beasts
[2023-01-05 18:16:33] <chap_sammy> Do they have the Norwegian league on SoRare?
[2023-01-05 18:16:34] <%+Izmayhem> was gonna say i would smash it with Liverpool stack but the players actually have to play well as well as knowledge
[2023-01-05 18:16:35] <ttv_hoboz> Is Haaland insanely overpriced? Considering he scores so often would it be worth it?
[2023-01-05 18:16:55] <@%Witchwalker70> My twitter timeline is now just full of foreign language football reporters LUL
[2023-01-05 18:17:02] <samx1012> a subjective pov on teams can also be not ideal since you might value a player more than he actually is just because you want him to be good

[2023-01-05 18:18:02] <%eatburgers1> The problem with a lot of the prem and bigger teams is that a lot of people have the same information so it's hard to differentiate. Learning about some J-League team would probably have more upside

[2023-01-05 18:43:53] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> @BobbyTambling It does, it gives you decisives for scoring goals. And hes brilliant at that and so his average is super high.

[2023-01-05 18:49:07] <%Pokes21228> would you recommend adding ETH to buy cards instead of using a CC?
[2023-01-05 18:49:09] <%whufcconnor> @BobbyTambling im free to play and won 3 rewards
[2023-01-05 18:49:15] <%AHumanAlien> @jay_alaw92 Yeah, so you should only play with what you feel comfortable with. If thats sticking to free to play then go for that. I decided to stop buying FIFA and have spent that money in Sorare instead. So  if players do go down. I've not lost out. Its money I would have put into FIFA anyway
[2023-01-05 18:49:16] <%$itsthatja> can you make a lot of money on sorare?

[2023-01-05 18:51:14] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> @dillon634 No stupid questions. NFT is essentially a piece of code. And it's unique. We have been conditioned to believe that its a picture. But that picture is essentially a jpeg attached to a piece of code on the blockchain. The code is what you own and that is linked to the picture. Because its on the blockchain, there is a public record of ownership.

[2023-01-05 18:53:41] <%AHumanAlien> @jay_alaw92 Best place to start is not even thinking about putting money in. Start with Free to play common cards. I did that for 6 months or so. Helps understand what is going on. I'd had enough of FIFA, thought, i'm not giving them any money so the price of the FIFA title is what I put in.

[2023-01-05 18:54:30] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> @davidg1993 However with the change in threshold coming in Feb. I would be looking at both limited and rare players to enter. Having double the number of players you actrually need is important for rotation and odd gameweeks

[2023-01-05 19:58:43] <campcrystal> Bicycle kick trait -will allow the Pro to perform bicycle kicks in certain situations, but you will not be able to force bicycle kicks. A Player with this trait will perform a greater amount of bicycle kicks contextually, and the player can perform a wider variety of bicycle kick animations.
[2023-01-05 19:58:44] <$Djordymans> Second wind could be hugo on politano. Its a must have trait on proclubs.

[2023-01-05 20:11:38] <@%+DavidMNobrega> Nep, League SBC's outright are absolutely insane rn because of Marquee matchups too, so some of the slightly expensive parts are even further down, you can do the whole SBC from scratch dirt cheap
[2023-01-05 20:11:39] <%+YaBoyBussey> i have enough tokens for either the tonali swap, 85 plus ww pick or the 85x10, which shall i get for most benefit, tonali fits in my current team perfectly aswell but im hoping for dumb luck to drop tommori

[2023-01-05 20:55:37] <+MrDzR> would you not may be be able to create an episode on fifa relating to real life, like playing with a squad with transfer rumours?
[2023-01-05 20:55:41] <+swindle23> nep do you not reckon burnout is a thing, overworking and doing it everyday will hinder your enthusiasm.

[2023-01-05 20:57:09] <+TeddyWestt> FM content on YT is more storytelling tho. It's more relaxed than FUT by a mile and the content creators are generally funnier

[2023-01-05 21:03:43] <%$JiiMiiE> I'd say the majority of us have watched you for 10+ years
[2023-01-05 21:03:43] <+TOONSTIG> Personally for me i have found it hard to watch, over the years to watch fifa streams when im not interested in the game as much as i like you or nick
[2023-01-05 21:03:44] <@%+DavidMNobrega> Jack of all trades master of none
[2023-01-05 21:03:45] <thurstonpafc> is politano good
[2023-01-05 21:03:58] <%$CBurrows55> @joshefc90 I didn't realise friendlies is SBMM so I don't want to get promoted

[2023-01-05 21:04:08] <Frog1786> I'm probs going to start streaming minecraft as i'm really enjoying it at the moment loving the building of my world
[2023-01-05 21:04:08] <%+theneash93> Stepped away from fifa for 4 years but back now and your my first port of call for content. Having your stream on makes playing fifa bearable sometimes haha
[2023-01-05 21:04:09] <%Maemmahdi> Hello, Nep. Is doing SBC Zidane?
[2023-01-05 21:04:14] <%+elpeano> Nah you‚Äôre the best at discussions. Don‚Äôt ever type in other streams

[2023-01-05 21:04:19] <garritosdorritos> I can't watch all the playing up the the camera stuff - The "serious" side is why I've watched you for 12 years
[2023-01-05 21:04:21] <%$JiiMiiE> Nah, you definitely are
[2023-01-05 21:04:21] <+Flamefrow> Blind to Bayern Munich ?!?!?!?!?!?!?

[2023-01-05 21:04:36] <sakaszn96> if you weren't entertaining you wouldn't have been able to do this for so long
[2023-01-05 21:04:38] <ovowalt> different kind of entertainment id say can take your content in larger doses compared to someone like danny no hate to him
[2023-01-05 21:04:40] <+RazorKameo> sterling injured already ffs

[2023-01-05 21:04:52] <%+JoshEFC90> @cburrows55 Mate honestly I always play people as good as me in every mode and as usual, I dominate on shots and get beat more often than not.
[2023-01-05 21:04:53] <%+Quilva> i love your sarcasm
[2023-01-05 21:04:53] <%+kikasfp1990> we respect you because we know that you know all about the game

[2023-01-05 21:05:42] <%$CBurrows55> @joshefc90 I cba to sweat friendlies I just want to chill
[2023-01-05 21:05:42] <Frog1786> People never see what you have done for other Nep then they might have a different view
[2023-01-05 21:05:47] <%+kingnovakin> I still enjoy the way you explain and talk about things
[2023-01-05 21:05:51] <+ShaKav_Gaming> I think people see relate to you in regards to your comments on fifa, we have all grown up watching and having that understanding.
[2023-01-05 21:05:51] <+MrDzR> yeah but i feel like your humour is very similar to mine and also you're very knowledgeable and can compare gaming aspects to the life experiences you've built up
[2023-01-05 21:05:55] <$lloyd2911> I watch you mostly because you are age appropriate
[2023-01-05 21:05:55] <logankerr96> Blind officially signed for Bayern just now from Fabrizio
[2023-01-05 21:05:56] <%+elpeano> I think you‚Äôd be class for the pro scene, wish EA would stop being so short sited
[2023-01-05 21:05:59] <+mxzefx> Talking abt that, any news on what centurions r coming out tomorrow? üòÇüòÇ
[2023-01-05 21:06:02] <mrsmoosh15> Let‚Äôs talk pelitano
[2023-01-05 21:06:09] <garritosdorritos> I can't watch all the playing up the the camera stuff - The "serious" side is why I've watched you for 12 years
[2023-01-05 21:06:11] <%+JoshEFC90> @cburrows55 I hear it mate. Friendlies are meant to be fun aren‚Äôt they pf23Frenkie
[2023-01-05 21:06:13] <%$Rocky94RPC> I think the younger generation have much more Americanised / slapstick kind of humour, which doesn‚Äôt help.
[2023-01-05 21:06:21] <+capnharsha> thoughts on the new generation of fifa creators ?
[2023-01-05 21:06:30] <%tomw99_> youve got 1.6k views and havent touched the controller for a hour, most people just watch your content for you
[2023-01-05 21:06:30] <%$CBurrows55> @joshefc90 yeah exactly 100%
[2023-01-05 21:06:30] <%+theneash93> Watch you stream cause it‚Äôs like having a pint with a mate chatting football. Love it
[2023-01-05 21:06:32] <%mmuurrrraayy02> i'm so sad i didn't get viera i put 10 tokens to gt an 84x20 but accidentally put it in the 3 84x20
[2023-01-05 21:06:37] <%+k1eron29> your an og of fifa for some many years u have entertained so many people
[2023-01-05 21:06:44] <%+maxsmith16_> i dont understand how i play this game non stop for 8 years and im still not very good cant even qualify for fut champs
[2023-01-05 21:06:50] <%+iamterry1997> I love the stream nep, you‚Äôre the realest streamer I‚Äôve watched with everyone else it just feels like they‚Äôre putting a persona on & I don‚Äôt enjoy that plus you talk about things in such a different way to others & I find you so relatable with most things.

[2023-01-05 21:07:02] <watchChallsHere> Why is politano broken?
[2023-01-05 21:07:04] <Mundo85> did they fix politanos taits now?
[2023-01-05 21:07:06] <%+danarlli> @theneash93 I completely agree with that
[2023-01-05 21:07:10] <%+elpeano> Do you think EA will try make amends when they leave the FIFA partnership? You‚Äôd be great for the pro scene
[2023-01-05 21:07:10] <+capnharsha> hectic and danny are gonna carry on the legacy i feel
[2023-01-05 21:07:10] <+robynrunning> I like Neppo. Hes a beast
[2023-01-05 21:07:17] <%+Josh_Szydelko> Been following you since early fifa 15 and the reason I‚Äôve stuck around and not got bored/lost interest is because you‚Äôre just genuinely real. You know what you‚Äôre going to get and it‚Äôs honest. And as you used to say, you get what you get and you don‚Äôt get upset
[2023-01-05 21:07:22] <+ability1991> I started watching when ‚Äú cheeky keylor navas ‚Äú became viral
[2023-01-05 21:07:26] <%$JiiMiiE> Yea you'd be an elite podcaster
[2023-01-05 21:07:27] <rfcalister> The advantage of fpl content is you do pretty much get s solid week in the international breaks of before you have then got to build up to the next game week
[2023-01-05 21:07:32] <%AHumanAlien> What would be the purpose of your podcast would you say?
[2023-01-05 21:07:35] <+mxzefx> Why does politano have every trait in the game?
[2023-01-05 21:07:36] <%+kikasfp1990> I think everyone knows you are not a pro, beside that you know the game, you played this game more than 10 years
[2023-01-05 21:07:37] <+Markoszc92> 10k hours
[2023-01-05 21:07:53] <%AHumanAlien> Purpose meaning - covering sport/video games e,t,c,
[2023-01-05 21:07:59] <%+Brandez84> I feel you have more passion in other areas, for example when you talk about sorare it‚Äôs all positive and we can all tell you love it
[2023-01-05 21:08:01] <+capnharsha> i started watching you in fifa 16
[2023-01-05 21:08:02] <%+ColeTrain3> Nep can build planes
[2023-01-05 21:08:10] <%exclusive457> its weird but i feel like when i watch your streams im just watching a 4/5 hour long video of nep and its the most enjoyable thing and whats makes you worlds apart from anyone else
[2023-01-05 21:08:14] <JzMac> Ive just joined‚Ä¶how is politano?
[2023-01-05 21:08:17] <%+elpeano> Do you think EA will make amends when they leave the FIFA partnership? You‚Äôd be great for the pro scene

[2023-01-05 21:08:30] <%EitchBee> I selfishly want more sorare content from you.  I'm really benefiting from you videos. Looking through some of you sorare vids from a year ago.
[2023-01-05 21:08:31] <cstredder> All time

[2023-01-05 21:08:39] <%AHumanAlien> @elpeano No chance, it will be the same game with just a name change
[2023-01-05 21:08:44] <%Maemmahdi> How Zidane? Worth it?
[2023-01-05 21:08:45] <%$JiiMiiE> But I feel you'd learn enough along the way by doing research and just putting yourself around people that are more knowledgeable in certain areas
[2023-01-05 21:08:51] <+powerrirl> love sorare
