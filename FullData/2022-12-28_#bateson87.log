[2022-12-28 13:21:42] <stevebellemey> I didn’t want gakpo as we need a striker and he’s not an out an out striker we have Rashford who can fill in that role just for now
[2022-12-28 13:21:44] <!%m3elv1n> you need a rw
[2022-12-28 13:21:47] <Craney28> if you can teach me how to dribble correctly and more effectivly i donate some money
[2022-12-28 13:21:47] <Tmesb> gakpo is no striker
[2022-12-28 13:21:49] <%honey__2110> forgot about jota 😂
[2022-12-28 13:21:49] <%+vvlad22> Gakpo can play CAM, LW, LM, ST, RW
[2022-12-28 13:21:50] <+jasonfox171> Nunez on the wing
[2022-12-28 13:21:52] <+SeeMeOnLANDfam> Liverpool move to 4231 next year and gakpo plays 10
[2022-12-28 13:21:52] <+Baine95> 4231 nunez LM and gakpo striker with salah RM @bateson87
[2022-12-28 13:21:53] <%meor70> gakpo lw st nunez rw salah
[2022-12-28 13:21:53] <+chris123page96> Gakpo has said he doesn’t want to be at Liverpool LUL
[2022-12-28 13:21:55] <sahxxxy> Darwin would go ST and Gakpo will go LW
[2022-12-28 13:21:55] <%+gootchii__> Through the middle/ interchange in game with Nunez
[2022-12-28 13:21:57] <%+cubbedapple> maybe a stupid question. How do ppl get all these awesome players on FUT?
[2022-12-28 13:21:58] <GoldenPxnts> nunez 9 gkpo lw
