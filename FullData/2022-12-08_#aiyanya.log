Ever since I saw you do DSR for the first time I have been a fan of your tank stance and pointy ears. No night goes by without me looking at your picture on my phone and putting it on my chest as I fall asleep. I wake up with your handsome face in front of me in the morning. I have several photos of you around my house. When I browse party finder i imagine requesting to party with you.]

[2022-12-08 09:08:54] <@%Dark_Fable> @Dark_Fable Yeah :< Seems for this whole FF7 remake stuff they decided to replace every VA. No idea why but not a single va from OG crisis core, advent children or even dissidia came back for any new FF7 game
[2022-12-08 09:09:33] VIEWERS: 33
[2022-12-08 09:11:04] <@%Dark_Fable> It is weird. Like Aerith it made sense she had a different VA each game
[2022-12-08 09:11:06] <~%Aiyanya> thank you TFrazer !! <3
[2022-12-08 09:11:25] <@%Dark_Fable> but Cloud had one VA for everything, and they just went "nah lets get all new younger cast"

[2022-12-08 09:40:33] <@%Dark_Fable> @aiyanya tldr one tournament organizer got official backing from nintendo, caused drama in the background, caused other non-offical big tournaments to get shut down by Nintendo, backlash caused sponsored one to close too

[2022-12-08 09:42:22] <@%operatorviera> I mean i can see how everyone else would hate him
[2022-12-08 09:42:30] <@%DosesMimosaz> its one of those its not my fault is ur fault
[2022-12-08 09:43:00] <@%DosesMimosaz> theres alot of inconsistency in the statement BUT what he said in the end makes a little sense and he came from a good place but HOW he went about doing it was very wrong

[2022-12-08 09:46:14] <@%Dark_Fable> Tldr: during one meeting with organizers he learned Nintendo will side with him and pressure the others (tho they instantly backpedaled), so he tried to use that to get people into his group. His goal was "we need the best talent in the officially supported tournament to prove its worth it"
