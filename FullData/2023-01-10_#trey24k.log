[2023-01-10 01:24:05] <%+LitHicks> it does count towards the mission to kill him on streets
[2023-01-10 01:24:08] <RLG0311> he did not
[2023-01-10 01:24:09] <%+POLO_5021> yea whoever said that is lying
[2023-01-10 01:24:09] <%+Lustful_ttv> he prob got reported 1000 times

[2023-01-10 01:24:22] <+zurrrp> he wasnt streaming anything ban worthy

[2023-01-10 01:24:39] <%teemolucas0909> I think the reason why cheats are rampant is because cheats are too easy to get. There is tons of free cheat if you google it, there is literally free cheat on Git HUb, although they probably have tons of virus and probably will steal your personal information if you use them
[2023-01-10 01:24:39] <%+akulabelow> i clicked off for a sec

[2023-01-10 02:54:59] <%samsquanch_9> @Trey24k they need to see inside cars when writing tickets that require a flashlight, and not pointing a gun at someone, why carry 2?

[2023-01-10 02:55:07] <ingrtan> You can hit with that big flashlight
[2023-01-10 02:55:07] <9Digitz> So you're not pointing your gun at everything you just need to look at lol
[2023-01-10 02:55:07] <+dom_menance> they may not be expensive.. but they are usually standard and you aren't allowed to deviate from what is issued
[2023-01-10 02:55:08] <%+dieselnj217> you ever been hit with a maglight? shit thumps
[2023-01-10 02:55:08] <FlacoNaco> Funding? As if they need more money
[2023-01-10 02:55:11] <+OG_Mudkip> it's not always good to target identify with a weapon mounted light because then you are potentially flagging someone who doesnt need to be
[2023-01-10 02:55:11] <+levitatingman> if you need the light to see then you point your weapon at everyone? thats bad policing lmao think for a second

[2023-01-10 02:55:13] <silenthazzardz> So you can hold your flash light off of your body cuz people will shoot at the light

[2023-01-10 03:38:26] <%oxLeTHaL> Shots 1-5: Clearly missed. Shots 6-9: Missed due to recoil (bad spray control). Shots 10-11: Very close, but recoil and inaccuracy make these reasonable misses. Shot 12: Likely didn't actually fire because Hiko was already dead.

[2023-01-10 05:56:45] <KwlaBear> they are resetting after kappa anyway @Fallen_Oac
[2023-01-10 05:56:47] <@%ethan8855> @Fallen_Oac The account is getting reset once they get Kappa, it's inconsequential @Fallen_Oac
[2023-01-10 05:56:48] <%$pure_gonzo_> Is there anyway to get ps12b now

[2023-01-10 11:18:09] <humID_chad> @ijsdude better cpu will boost frames. Better get 32gb ram also, this game leaks of memory😅
[2023-01-10 11:18:15] <ijsdude> I want the new ryzen cpu they will announce next month with the 3d cache
[2023-01-10 11:18:20] <sidewayzjax> @galentheol then u must have a good cpu

[2023-01-10 11:19:14] <%ohgrabme> with the mem leak , after 1-2 streets raids my pc starts eating up 20+ gigs of ram

[2023-01-10 11:21:34] <+Ricskoferi> yep, but the cash memory is the ace in the sleeve
[2023-01-10 11:21:53] <%+Matte_h83> what it does actually is just showing how bad tarkov is coded.. it shouldnt be depending so much on cpu..

[2023-01-10 12:58:08] <Karlanker> @2thy Yes, feel free to ask me for more tarkov tips! xD
[2023-01-10 12:58:44] <jack_tudyks> 5% spawn rate for Killa. watching tray and twothy hunt him all day and night. Run an interchange scav to try and find some food for Jaeger. Run right into killa.

[2023-01-10 12:59:46] <isnipettvers> video output is really bad
[2023-01-10 12:59:53] <%Scuba_SK> is it still killa and the goons outstanding for the bosses?
[2023-01-10 13:00:00] <isnipettvers> just a fyi
[2023-01-10 13:00:17] <bundybear8> I found the John B glasses in a duffle bag on streets the other day while doing a scav run. I would give them to you if I could but I know that not possible
[2023-01-10 13:00:41] <piercehawthorn3> where killa
[2023-01-10 13:00:52] <+RaveDaveFPS> come out killa

[2023-01-10 13:02:47] <Ob3n> still no killa or what?
[2023-01-10 13:02:50] <%$fullerk55> it is hit and miss on when he does, but he has before

[2023-01-10 13:03:58] <%Scuba_SK> we need to keep a tally or no boss raids for this. I bet it will come out that the boss spawn rate is way less than 5%
[2023-01-10 13:04:42] <%$fullerk55> I thought the 5% was data mined?
[2023-01-10 13:05:16] <Karlanker> killa killa
[2023-01-10 13:05:20] <bruno_27xx> Imagine finding killa just to have a cheater murder him in front of your virgin eyes lol
[2023-01-10 13:05:28] VIEWERS: 1 791
[2023-01-10 13:05:42] <sam__coates> it will be 5% but he can spawn almost all locations inside mall so will miss a lot of them, not worth it to check all levels 100%
[2023-01-10 13:05:44] <Karlanker> so high
[2023-01-10 13:05:50] <+Sethicus111> glizzyL glizzyR  for the glizzy, killa will spawn
[2023-01-10 13:05:51] <trey24kmom> iwatch
[2023-01-10 13:06:02] <sam__coates> so more realistic to only see 2-3% of time at an estimate, depending how much of mall they clear
[2023-01-10 13:06:56] <Ob3n> and the one time he sees him a fing cheater kills him Sadge
[2023-01-10 13:07:03] <%+froggazoid> Killa 100% spawn under IDEA this raid. Time me out if I am wrong

[2023-01-10 14:02:36] <+XoXOrangejuiceXo> @benjy142 tbh my hopes are low, I love the gameplay of tarkov, but I think at the end of the day it will be a different developer that actually makes the pinnacle of this genre. They take too long with small changes and run in circles

[2023-01-10 14:06:41] <+XoXOrangejuiceXo> @Dies_Often That would make sense how every patch they break something they didn't mean to with a completely unrelated update.
[2023-01-10 14:06:51] <961mysterious> marked room got nerfed
[2023-01-10 14:06:58] <curbinp1> what therapist give 315k wasn't sure if market be more
[2023-01-10 14:07:12] <PatoJOGA> its not about the loot, its about the quest, its worth a ton right now

[2023-01-10 14:08:04] <PatoJOGA> if you want a real money making key, try to barter it for a Chek 15 on steets
[2023-01-10 14:08:16] <%shnazzle> @Dies_Often i dunno man.. ive seen some garbage engines. APB Reloaded's engine is still 32bit and in the process of getting upgraded to a 64bit architecture.. in 2023.
[2023-01-10 14:08:22] <+Frizzll> has anyone got Kappa legit yet?
[2023-01-10 14:08:23] <+XoXOrangejuiceXo> @Dies_Often I imagine its chaos when you have an entire codebase and a brand new dev that doesnt know how to interact with it
[2023-01-10 14:08:24] <curbinp1> @patojoga I'll give it a shot
[2023-01-10 14:08:37] <KaspurrTheGoat> i found check 15 in a streets scav run lol
[2023-01-10 14:08:39] <+XoXOrangejuiceXo> @Dies_Often adds a lot of time to small changes because shit breaks

[2023-01-10 14:09:02] <PatoJOGA> I'm just camping the flea market for it, I'll pay 3mil for it in a heart beat (check 15)
[2023-01-10 14:09:20] <KaspurrTheGoat> what'd nikita say was broke?

[2023-01-10 14:10:27] <curbinp1> yet to run streets been avoiding till quest line
[2023-01-10 14:10:36] <PatoJOGA> I usually loot that whole building and get like 500k-1mil per reaid without that key
[2023-01-10 14:10:37] <KaspurrTheGoat> a gpu was sitting on a pallet lol
[2023-01-10 14:10:44] <PatoJOGA> the key would be a nice addition to the run
[2023-01-10 14:10:54] <KaspurrTheGoat> @curbinp1 you'll have plenty there

[2023-01-10 14:11:26] <+jenusi9974> @XoXOrangejuiceXo pretty sure streets has way more rare items

Having ADHD that makes your brain function at Limitless speeds and then being on Amphetamines to focus you and help speed you up even more.

[2023-01-10 17:05:31] <%dappyreturns> @joshboxg I think a lot of it comes from being in a "honored" position in the community, where you have a lot of input/connection - and then making a claim, that is not only wrong, but so wildly crazy wrong, but the pride is hurt in such a way, the inital reaction is to just burn it all down.

Then, just stay in the far left puddle about 10 seconds. After that, the ground will shake and then the player should hear a Japanese-like voice (it is a reversed quote of a Japanese Solider[1]). Four Shisa statues will arise from the ground holding a Ray Gun.

[2023-01-10 18:12:17] <%YEEWAK> @ViewedMarmot in my experience? depends on the cop. he's got an open container and is clearly inebriated, and the precedent that exists rn is that if you're able to "reach your keys with ease" and start the car to drive away, you can still get a dui. so, there's cases where dude is passed out in driver seat with keys in the cup holder... dui. dude is passed out in driver seat with keys in trunk? not as likely

[2023-01-10 19:45:05] <jumpingsnail__> the stupidest thing about it is if they really wanted to ban cheaters it would be easy all they gotta look for is codes that have been changed if u know coding u understand what i mean its not hard to find out when someone changes the codes the only reason they don’t is cuz the money the cheaters bring its facts technically they could make a dummy server and anyone with changed codes aka cheaters could be singled out and always sent to a dummy server

[2023-01-10 21:55:58] <%+MapleYamCakes> @returnofthedok that would just make everyone run M80 too early.  It outclasses nearly every other ammo early wipe.  The instant people unlock M80 craft in workbench every other caliber would get abandoned.

[2023-01-10 21:56:38] <returnofthedok> @MapleYamCakes right but thats what i am saying, you should be able to run m80 much earlier in my opinion. Not an infinite amount, but it should be run-able

[2023-01-10 21:58:01] <%+MapleYamCakes> @returnofthedok I personally enjoy what's happeing right now with tons of 9x19, 9x18, 5.45, 7.62 PS being run without a lot of M80.  I think the problem is that by the time M80 becomes available you also probably have access to M62 and M61 craft, so M80 is just kind of useless now.

[2023-01-10 21:59:53] <%+MapleYamCakes> @returnofthedok M80 might not be useless though, if they reduce the amount of M62 available and the amount of M61 craft.  If they made M80 buy limit like 5 or 6 times higher than M62 it would still be used a lot.  People would blow through their M62 and then move on to their larger amounts of M80.

[2023-01-10 22:56:09] <%happierfeet_> I, personally, think scavs should spawn with kits equal to those of pmc's that load into the raid. It's only fair. If you spawn in as a scav you spawn in late right? So you should have some sort of advantage. Player scavs are basically pmc's who are down bad, so it's only fair if the get a buff tbh.

[2023-01-10 23:01:23] <%happierfeet_> I, personally, think scavs should spawn with kits equal to those of pmc's that load into the raid. It's only fair. If you spawn in as a scav you spawn in late right? So you should have some sort of advantage. Player scavs are basically pmc's who are down bad, so it's only fair if the get a buff tbh.
