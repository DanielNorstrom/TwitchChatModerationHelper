[2022-12-08 00:32:49] <Dealigh_> @Hera you might have been given this idea, or thought about it yourself. But having these replays as a list ordered by elos in youtube would be really great for your channel there

[2022-12-08 00:36:36] <%vanllladonut> holy that guy is a micro nerd
[2022-12-08 00:36:57] <+DJSchaffner> i predict the opponent has horrbile eco behind if he micros the scouts so much on this elo
[2022-12-08 00:37:08] <yaukmd> @DJSchaffner not really

[2022-12-08 00:37:19] <yaukmd> he can set it to woodline
[2022-12-08 00:37:22] <%speidelta> Yeah, yellow is definitely in shambles at home
[2022-12-08 00:37:29] <cptevanss> @DJSchaffner yeah his scors is suspiciously low
[2022-12-08 00:38:01] <%$PurgeFIN> omfg
[2022-12-08 00:38:02] <cptevanss> but his raid still did a lot Kappa

[2022-12-08 00:38:24] <%speidelta> We can go 3 tc so quick here
[2022-12-08 00:38:33] <%+Aleximous> this is frustrating
[2022-12-08 00:38:39] <%vanllladonut> okay maybe hes not
[2022-12-08 00:38:46] <+MeerKatBob> bro how can he keep losing so much to these scouts

[2022-12-08 00:39:17] <thewalurs> this is a great lesson at least
[2022-12-08 00:39:23] <+PapayaPokkPokk> can you coach my AOE4 match?
[2022-12-08 00:39:27] <%$PurgeFIN> all that dmg and still not further ahead so, theres hope
[2022-12-08 00:39:29] <cptevanss> just let the scouts run around their tc and see if you can kill a vill occasionally
[2022-12-08 00:39:48] <cptevanss> shift queueing makes that so easy
[2022-12-08 00:39:49] <%+nealpstars19> King Hera graces his pedantic underlings with his galactic wealth of AOE knowledge, whilst we all shower in the wisdom of the king

[2022-12-08 00:40:06] <%+pouseaoe> Feel like 1150 should probably start using control groups yeah?
[2022-12-08 00:40:12] <%speidelta> More farms. don't stop knight production.
[2022-12-08 00:40:18] <%$PurgeFIN> @cptevanss only at 1k, higher elo's actually predict the scouts path
[2022-12-08 00:40:24] <lfishl> 2 knights handicap
[2022-12-08 00:40:35] <%vanllladonut> Deadge
[2022-12-08 00:40:39] <%krunklord_of_the_west> @PapayaPokkPokk we don't speak of that

[2022-12-08 00:40:49] <antico5> yellow is  very good, I'm sure he's higher elo
[2022-12-08 00:40:50] <+zonaR> he's losing it
[2022-12-08 00:40:52] <%speidelta> gg. well played to both
[2022-12-08 00:40:53] <cptevanss> @PurgeFIN it works at 1.5k

[2022-12-08 00:41:10] <ChaosLike> Sadge
[2022-12-08 00:41:10] <s3sebastian> 90% of the time when I watch SnibeLL (also in his stream) he loses, lol
[2022-12-08 00:41:11] <thewalurs> damn, oponent looks better than 1150
[2022-12-08 00:41:20] <%$PurgeFIN> @cptevanss well not vs me then :D
[2022-12-08 00:41:22] <%speidelta> Woodman just flexing

[2022-12-08 00:41:33] <+daveymcdaveson> yellow cmoooooon
[2022-12-08 00:41:40] <lowliferaccoon> stupid question but what is the difference between "quit game" and "resign"? I always click quit game because it's first 11
[2022-12-08 00:41:44] <cptevanss> @PurgeFIN yeah depending on your opponent you maybe have to look a bit more
[2022-12-08 00:41:45] <%parkouring_penguin> boo

[2022-12-08 00:42:03] <+DJSchaffner> @lowliferaccoon quit puts you in resource screen, resign doesnt
[2022-12-08 00:42:07] <%+arpicordi> @lowliferaccoon  with resign you can stay on the map I think
[2022-12-08 00:42:12] <lowliferaccoon> ah, i see. thanks

[2022-12-08 00:42:21] <yaukmd> @lowliferaccoon quit game is going to desktop, resign leads you to summary Kappa

[2022-12-08 00:47:07] <ChaosLike> snumey fog of war is not real, it can't hurt you monkaW
[2022-12-08 00:47:09] <+sharperguy_> fog is the key to that extra 200 elo you cant quite get
[2022-12-08 00:47:25] <%speidelta> 1k to 1.5k in 3 weeks. This man is a miracle worker.
[2022-12-08 00:47:26] <@%RoxyC> I havent played in months and im not interested in improving so wont be getting coached any time soon :)
[2022-12-08 00:47:31] <The_Balding_strategist> is there a way to increase apm rather than just playing a lot?

[2022-12-08 01:56:34] <+cbox7> @awwwwhamburgers I read it the same
[2022-12-08 01:56:35] <%+MiyakoBestGirl> It's just the changes themselves are kinda weird
[2022-12-08 01:56:46] <%+MiyakoBestGirl> I'm down though
[2022-12-08 01:57:02] <%+MiyakoBestGirl> If any civ needs some experimenting with bonuses it's portuguese right now
[2022-12-08 01:57:15] <Cr1syz> this opponent is so bad 11 no wonder has to play this clown strat
[2022-12-08 01:57:27] <unreeaI> why she not playing with Gurjars?
[2022-12-08 01:57:49] <+cbox7> I like the wood one. Is the 25 percent research a nerf? I thought it was 33 before. Now it’s a team bonus so added use for tgs though
[2022-12-08 01:58:01] <%+MiyakoBestGirl> Yeah
[2022-12-08 01:58:02] <%+MiyakoBestGirl> It was
[2022-12-08 01:58:04] <%+MiyakoBestGirl> So it's a nerf
[2022-12-08 01:58:08] <%+MiyakoBestGirl> But it's whole team for TG
[2022-12-08 01:58:12] <%+MiyakoBestGirl> So maybe they felt like they had to

[2022-12-08 01:58:20] <%+MiyakoBestGirl> Still feels bad for 1v1s though FeelsBadMan
[2022-12-08 01:58:26] <+cbox7> Yeah that’s a pretty solid team game buff
[2022-12-08 01:58:59] <+cbox7> The wood is pretty nice though with the forage bushes. It’s basically the dravidians bonus except faster (200 wood)
[2022-12-08 01:58:59] <%Cr1syz> @thaetre oh boy thank you so much! andreiiHi
[2022-12-08 01:59:18] <Irubberbear> nioce
[2022-12-08 01:59:29] <@%+AwwwwHamburgers> i feel like overall it was a good rework of the bonuses for portuguese.  might need some more tweaking, but it's a step in the right direction for them
[2022-12-08 02:00:00] <f_shepherd> @cbox7 some of it is faster but some is slower. since you dont get all the berries before feudal comes its worse than dravidians imo
[2022-12-08 02:00:02] <ahmedk27> archers should go forward
[2022-12-08 02:00:09] <%Idi_B> andreiiWall
[2022-12-08 02:00:54] <f_shepherd> @cbox7 in late feudal its 250 wood but at the start of feudal its prob like 75 wood

[2022-12-08 02:01:45] <+cbox7> @f_shepherd depends on timing but true true. Slightly worse than dravidians I agree. But Portuguese also get the research and cheaper gold so I’m fine with it
[2022-12-08 02:02:05] <ofrannco> new tc
[2022-12-08 02:02:10] <@%+AwwwwHamburgers> @cbox7 yeah, i'll be interested to see how it plays out overall

[2022-12-08 02:02:35] <%mathiusww> not too much wood for the plan tho

[2022-12-08 02:04:56] <+skramj3t> @cbox7 i have been playing recently! it's a ton of fun and im sitting at like 800 elo, still getting used to all the new civilizations though

[2022-12-08 02:05:26] <%+pseudovictor> i took a break for a year almost and it's still very tough to come back
[2022-12-08 02:05:35] <%+pseudovictor> the game and strats are evolving big time
[2022-12-08 02:05:48] <+cbox7> Plus gives Portuguese more ammo for castle organs or fast imp plays
[2022-12-08 02:06:05] <@%+AwwwwHamburgers> @cbox7 yeah, after i said that i was wondering if the extra wood might allow an extra vil saving on the FC
[2022-12-08 02:06:13] <%+MiyakoBestGirl> Just goes to show how strong the poles were, that both of their main eco bonuses will be cut to 2/3rds and they will still probably be viable, even if I'm doubting if their current popularity will be retained
[2022-12-08 02:06:17] <+RON4N_10> is it ok to sent two or three kts to the other city?

[2022-12-08 02:09:07] <madmaxima> It think if she deleted her mining camp right when her knights were there she could've denied that castle
[2022-12-08 02:09:26] <+cbox7> @philpsie I’ll add gujaras to that
[2022-12-08 02:09:41] <philpsie> @cbox7 100% I'm so salty they didn't get more of a nerf this patch
[2022-12-08 02:09:41] <f_shepherd> @cbox7 berries gather rate 0.31 so 4 on berries is 1.24 with 33 percent trickle its 0.413 which a lumberjack with no upgrades is 0.39 so yes its basically one vil on wood with 4 on berries

[2022-12-08 02:36:15] <+hundredbagger> the best tactic here is to press alt and then the f4 button
[2022-12-08 02:36:20] <+hundredbagger> tht will auto kill all the castles
[2022-12-08 02:36:22] <+cbox7> Now we know how he could afford those castles… that stone price was massive

[2022-12-08 02:49:45] <the_meek__> woah I had no idea
[2022-12-08 02:49:53] <%ElBaizen> Scouts are terrible on aggresive stance
[2022-12-08 02:49:53] <%ChaosLike> this is some good advice Pog
[2022-12-08 02:49:58] <%vanllladonut> check heras micro videos on youtube
[2022-12-08 02:50:02] <+Ebi99> normal formation not good?
[2022-12-08 02:50:04] <%ElBaizen> They bump into stuff all the time and dont focus on attacking the unit you tasked them to

[2022-12-08 02:50:10] <CaptnObvios> #3 Thats an amazing tip, I wish i knew that
[2022-12-08 02:50:13] <Dconquist> Good attitude too
[2022-12-08 02:50:30] <%+GTyellowjacket> You can also Ctrl right click on units and stay on attack stance, it achieves the same thing as stand ground but better after the fight
[2022-12-08 02:50:37] <$TheCaberworld> Dumb as rocks me, but eventually realised I could switch the default military stance FROM aggressive to defensive.
[2022-12-08 02:50:46] <atillandsia> That idle vill thing is my #1 bad habit omg
[2022-12-08 02:50:49] <%ElBaizen> @GTyellowjacket But it's more micro intensive though
[2022-12-08 02:51:07] <ahmedk27> @atillandsia whats ur idle vill hotkey
[2022-12-08 02:51:11] <龍哥好棒 (g913happykillersain)> good moing.
[2022-12-08 02:51:25] <%+GTyellowjacket> @elbaizen not really, if you don’t want to fight after killing the vil, you can just shift the queue away
[2022-12-08 02:51:25] <%ChaosLike> i don't think she was using idle vil hotkey, that would help
[2022-12-08 02:51:36] <atillandsia> @ahmedk27 spacebar, shift+space selects all
[2022-12-08 02:51:51] <Konijn246> i feel like i would panic a lot more during coaching lol

[2022-12-08 13:52:52] <shiva_indic> grids can hardly be seen
[2022-12-08 13:53:28] <$Or1ginalclassified> how come you dont use mods anymore?
[2022-12-08 13:53:49] <%$PurgeFIN>* sigh
[2022-12-08 13:53:51] <%+ruubje033> Do the records need to be against ppl or u also coach against AI?
[2022-12-08 13:53:55] <%shotelcalifornia> the "no intro" mod cancels the opening cinematic, so when the intro plays it's a good reminder your mods are off. Works for me.
[2022-12-08 13:53:58] <%Daniela_AoE> nice looking forward to feeling like a prom noob I already feel like 111
[2022-12-08 13:54:06] <%Daniela_AoE> pro*
[2022-12-08 13:54:07] <@%+AwwwwHamburgers> @Or1ginalclassified there was just a patch last night which auto-disables your mods.  he just needs to re-enable them
[2022-12-08 13:54:15] <honesthellfire> the trees are flourishing
[2022-12-08 13:54:18] <honesthellfire> :)
[2022-12-08 13:54:38] <!%jona115> is it beneficial as Chinese to switch units because techs are cheaper and more costly for the other player ?
[2022-12-08 13:54:40] <$Or1ginalclassified> @Or1ginalclassified ahhh i see
[2022-12-08 13:54:51] <Kasenbrot> u forgot mods? :D
[2022-12-08 13:54:54] <@%+AwwwwHamburgers> @shotelcalifornia i have the Old Main Menu mod which serves the same purpose
[2022-12-08 13:55:31] <@%+AwwwwHamburgers> it's by design.  that way nobody runs into the game not starting because the update broke a mod.  still shit design, though

[2022-12-08 14:10:25] <%Torrelles> @bogsauce don't you dare
[2022-12-08 14:10:27] <PurplenHaze> So hera you think that if i've watched your stream for lets say 1000 hours and i've earned x amount of your channel points for 1000 hours watching you. Then you think that i dont deserve free coaching?
[2022-12-08 14:10:30] <luffy541> @amotz64 I remember they used those in redbull
[2022-12-08 14:10:35] <amotz64> @luffy541 ye, 32 would be nice for photo editing but I think it’s a bit to big
[2022-12-08 14:10:40] <hackxxcker> Where can I find the new patch ?
[2022-12-08 14:10:43] <hackxxcker> details
[2022-12-08 14:10:46] <$pro_backseatgamer> you can try cav archer buf with vietnamese
[2022-12-08 14:10:49] <luffy541> 32 is huge for a desk. 11
[2022-12-08 14:10:51] <micahcweaver20> Hera play Portaguese after this?
[2022-12-08 14:10:55] <bart20085> did you know that aoe is comin to mobile?
[2022-12-08 14:10:57] <%Daniela_AoE> @willishereee I think we still have a game left, but after he gets back from germany :) gonna have time to practice those ctrl groups
[2022-12-08 14:10:58] <@%+AwwwwHamburgers> @PurplenHaze i think in that case you've already received a lot of free coaching
[2022-12-08 14:11:01] <!%jona115> when is the new patch coming in?
[2022-12-08 14:11:04] <%+ruubje033> Is hard AI compareable with starting ranked?
[2022-12-08 14:11:08] <amotz64> @luffy541 ok, i’ll check ! Thanks a lot
[2022-12-08 14:11:20] <+manbeast_og> @ruubje033 probably up till 1000 elo~
[2022-12-08 14:11:23] <micahcweaver20> @pro_backseatgamer fax
[2022-12-08 14:11:26] <%lucab_92> here for the portuguese funny starts
[2022-12-08 14:11:26] <%DeimosD2> @ruubje033 max AI is 1000-1100 for sure
[2022-12-08 14:11:35] <%Torrelles> @PurplenHaze That narrative is so flawed and manipulative it's not even worth discussing
[2022-12-08 14:11:40] <%ojciecalbina> do you use a mod for the green grass or is this just standard arabia?
[2022-12-08 14:11:49] <%+ruubje033> @DeimosD2 Thx for reacting!
[2022-12-08 14:12:00] <%Daniela_AoE> @lucab_92 PogChamp
[2022-12-08 14:12:04] <+manbeast_og> @ojciecalbina varies map to map I think
[2022-12-08 14:12:15] <@%+AwwwwHamburgers> @ojciecalbina there's desert and grass arabia, just depends on the gen
[2022-12-08 14:12:16] <%lucab_92> has anyone tried the portuguese mill before lumber camp? @chat.
[2022-12-08 14:12:36] <SiaBBo_StarCraft> with a new patch comes a new path to 2800
[2022-12-08 14:12:43] <LuckyLarryySilverstein> @lucab_92 its not great
[2022-12-08 14:12:45] <%+neversmiter> but you will have to delete these houses at some point, right? yesterday you said not to use houses like that, or did I misunderstand?
[2022-12-08 14:12:51] <%ojciecalbina> @ojciecalbina okthx, just thoutgh I always get the desert much more often that Hera
[2022-12-08 14:12:57] <+manbeast_og> @lucab_92 waiting for portugese on nomad to be putting down mills before tcs at this rate 11
[2022-12-08 14:13:07] <Quadrakteur> nice nostalgic 8bit game
[2022-12-08 14:13:30] <@%+AwwwwHamburgers> @Quadrakteur heraCringe
[2022-12-08 14:13:37] <luffy541> Portuguese now good on Kawasan?
[2022-12-08 14:13:51] <%lucab_92> @luckylarryysilverstein disagree. you can now do a 19 pop scouts real easy
[2022-12-08 14:14:05] <%lucab_92> I just like strange early builds tho
[2022-12-08 14:14:08] <%q8a2x2> 70
[2022-12-08 14:14:32] <+manbeast_og> I think a massive buff for the porugese is the tech research time team bonus - gunna make researching Paladin in TGs as an ally so much easier
[2022-12-08 14:14:39] <%chabootay121> How do you make your units attack the enemy without clicking one unit and jumping on it
[2022-12-08 14:14:57] <%$PurgeFIN> patrol hotkey
[2022-12-08 14:15:01] <micahcweaver20> @chabootay121 Patrol
[2022-12-08 14:15:04] <didierdecampe> When is the Grand Melee happening ?
[2022-12-08 14:15:06] <%$PurgeFIN> Q as a standard i believe
[2022-12-08 14:15:13] <luffy541> @manbeast_og Yeah, with Huns ally a Franks guy can research paladin 85 percent faster. 11
[2022-12-08 14:15:16] <SiaBBo_StarCraft> or just attack move
[2022-12-08 14:15:32] <%$PurgeFIN> neither of them work 100% of the time tho 11
[2022-12-08 14:15:35] <luffy541> 20 from huns bonus 25 portugues bonus and Chivalry.
[2022-12-08 14:15:53] <%lucab_92> insta paladin Kreygasm
[2022-12-08 14:15:55] <+manbeast_og> @luffy541 exactly! Or even Burgundians might become a go to civ for 2v2s, ending games with super early paladin!
[2022-12-08 14:16:05] <$Or1ginalclassified> why patrol not attack move?
[2022-12-08 14:16:21] <@%+AwwwwHamburgers> @didierdecampe starts a week from today
[2022-12-08 14:16:25] <Qoning> i would like to see hera coach hera
[2022-12-08 14:16:32] <luffy541> 25 percent seems little too high.
[2022-12-08 14:16:33] <amotz64> Min 18 and almost on his way to castle…the hell…
[2022-12-08 14:16:40] <luffy541> Maybe they should ahve started with 20 percent.
[2022-12-08 14:16:43] <SiaBBo_StarCraft> patrol is old habit from earlier versions of the game
[2022-12-08 14:16:44] <Aqua_PvP__> age up counts as technology upgrade ?
[2022-12-08 14:16:48] <luffy541> No
[2022-12-08 14:16:49] <didierdecampe> @AwwwwHamburgers thx
[2022-12-08 14:16:50] <+manbeast_og> @Qoning I would like to see Hera coach Areh
[2022-12-08 14:16:55] <luffy541> @Aqua_PvP__
[2022-12-08 14:17:02] <%chabootay121> oh ok thanks
[2022-12-08 14:17:03] <$Or1ginalclassified> @SiaBBo_StarCraft and thats the only reason?
[2022-12-08 14:17:11] <@%+AwwwwHamburgers> @Aqua_PvP__ age up is explicitly excluded
[2022-12-08 14:17:17] <$Or1ginalclassified> patrl and attack move have the same effect right?
[2022-12-08 14:17:21] <+manbeast_og> @Aqua_PvP__ I think patch notes excluded aging up from the bonus
[2022-12-08 14:17:22] <$Or1ginalclassified> in terms of attacking
[2022-12-08 14:17:24] <!%jona115> so many archers
[2022-12-08 14:17:29] <%GrandNagusHD> old new indians would have been trouble here LUL
[2022-12-08 14:17:30] <Aqua_PvP__> oh
[2022-12-08 14:17:33] <%+Masmorra_AoE> @Or1ginalclassified well patrol actuall make units "patrol" an area
[2022-12-08 14:17:34] <%lybecker_aoe> !match
[2022-12-08 14:17:35] <@%^Nightbot> " 🔴  mYi.Daniel (2518) as Spanish vs  🔵  Hera (2715) as Chinese playing on Arabia"
[2022-12-08 14:17:38] <sergiobr1_> thats a lot of archers
[2022-12-08 14:17:41] <Aqua_PvP__> i see
[2022-12-08 14:17:41] <SiaBBo_StarCraft> pretty much. attack move might be even better. sotl has a video about it
[2022-12-08 14:17:46] <luffy541> This is a A tier team bonus imo
[2022-12-08 14:17:48] <$Or1ginalclassified> @Masmorra_AoE yeah, but in terms of attacking i mean
[2022-12-08 14:17:55] <$Or1ginalclassified> i realise that :D
[2022-12-08 14:18:01] <%+Masmorra_AoE> yeah in that case I believe the behavior is now pretty much the same
[2022-12-08 14:18:12] <+mrtrouserbanana> sooo did they actually buff chakrams lol
[2022-12-08 14:18:15] <$Or1ginalclassified> mhhm, i see
[2022-12-08 14:18:28] <%+Masmorra_AoE> attack move used to be much better, but was recently nerfed
[2022-12-08 14:18:36] <+manbeast_og> @mrtrouserbanana bit of an 'it depends' answer unfortunately 11
[2022-12-08 14:19:00] <%badserg96> Sup
[2022-12-08 14:19:10] <Kellar_AoE> could have trapped him

[2022-12-08 15:18:40] <%+arpicordi> @Daniela_AoE  1 mod for each type of building right?
[2022-12-08 15:18:44] <%Daniela_AoE> yes
[2022-12-08 15:18:45] <SaladEsc> i think it's nice for when you wanna go for an early drush, but besides that it's a passive bonus imo

[2022-12-08 15:22:07] <shredmaster_2000> kinda feels like the 19 or 18 pop archer build in terms of agression, but with slightly better eco

[2022-12-08 15:22:27] <+fishhead84> @saga90 they get 33% wood for their foraging likes poles get gold for stone

[2022-12-08 15:23:04] <@%+AwwwwHamburgers> @jtan7th they already have a gold discount
[2022-12-08 15:23:12] <@%tryptix_> @jtan7th I'd say it's just targeted at a different stage o the game
[2022-12-08 15:23:16] <+fishhead84> also the bonus starts earlier
[2022-12-08 15:23:33] <@%RoxyC> Time to gift again to see more goths Kappa
[2022-12-08 15:23:33] <@%tryptix_> A wood bonus like that incentivizes feudal play, poles bonus incentivizes castle age play
[2022-12-08 15:23:45] <%+jtan7th> just feel like there are like what 8 bushes compared to 20+ stone piles on map
[2022-12-08 15:23:50] <%+jtan7th> but then again worth testing
[2022-12-08 15:24:09] <monkaLaugh_ThumbsUp> its 250 dark/feudal wood its a good bonus
[2022-12-08 15:24:10] <@%tryptix_> Yeah but getting an edge in feudal seems comparatively much more powerful
[2022-12-08 15:24:21] <%TheSparkyTV> heyo

[2022-12-08 15:25:48] <@%tryptix_> I actually like putting more bonuses in that encourage feudal play. I think it makes the game more exciting to have messier feudal ages

[2022-12-08 15:29:46] <%$pro_backseatgamer> does the elephant cost change do something significant ?
[2022-12-08 15:29:49] <%satisferisin> If civilization were equal for the arena, would you ban the arena?

[2022-12-08 15:33:34] <@%^Nightbot> Some military leaders have dedicated themselves to the art of the army and the blade. Not Hera though. While some studied the blade and bow, Hera studied the hammer and nail. Some generals strive towards positioning and formations. Hera? He knows how to defeat armies with walls and gates. Think your army with forging and husbandry has a chance? we'll see about that when they're on display in Hera's base, trapped between palisade gates and markets. Army? Your army is a zoo now, kid.

[2022-12-08 15:43:12] <%vanllladonut> i mean its not like league where patches can shift the meta

[2022-12-08 15:44:04] <@%RoxyC> @qualdum its terrible to play in older patch
[2022-12-08 15:44:12] <Time2Pretend> is the tourney this weekend or next weekend?
[2022-12-08 15:44:12] <%vanllladonut> why not ca danny

[2022-12-08 15:44:17] <jaheq> i mean league does previous patches aswell
[2022-12-08 15:44:27] <+Qualdum> @Hera a lot of games do it all the time - league worlds are always played on old patches
[2022-12-08 15:44:29] <+nonitaaaa> !yo
[2022-12-08 15:44:29] <@%^Nightbot> nonitaaaa -> https://www.douyu.com/mryo
[2022-12-08 15:44:34] <flash_70> yeah what games definitely do tourneys on previous patches for these cases
[2022-12-08 15:44:41] <time2thinkmore> @RoxyC idk, it's standard practice in league of legends
[2022-12-08 15:44:43] <monkaLaugh_ThumbsUp> does poles say the rate now too?
[2022-12-08 15:44:48] <@%RoxyC> But this isnt league
[2022-12-08 15:44:54] <@%RoxyC> What are those comparisons
[2022-12-08 15:44:54] <@%+AwwwwHamburgers> at least the casters wouldn't have to worry about switching to a different patch, because there won't be any casters heraCringe
[2022-12-08 15:45:00] <ludumkaisar> heya
[2022-12-08 15:45:14] <+joaljoestar> @RoxyC why u would ever play older patch in aoe LUL
[2022-12-08 15:45:17] <+puasonelrasho> the cartography for tg isnt bad?
[2022-12-08 15:45:27] <@%RoxyC> @awwwwhamburgers nili was confirmed. So its nili and dave so far
[2022-12-08 15:45:40] <@%+AwwwwHamburgers> @RoxyC i just meant it's closed casting
[2022-12-08 15:45:42] <@%RoxyC> No t90 or memb will feel odd
[2022-12-08 15:45:43] <v1do_aoe> why do you think they dont address the britons for arabia tg... they feel frustrating to play against them if you arent same civ
[2022-12-08 15:45:47] <@%RoxyC> Oh yeah that too
[2022-12-08 15:45:49] <!%jona115> I get trouble with camels in castle, they produce so fast. also gulam is a curve ball all that slows your imp time
[2022-12-08 15:45:51] <%Xarkey77> @puasonelrasho In my opinion free carto is terrible
[2022-12-08 15:45:52] <+puasonelrasho> i thought someting similar
[2022-12-08 15:45:54] <Zenith_UK> Hera, thoughts on a TG where the resources are pooled together, maybe in like a 2v2?
[2022-12-08 15:45:55] <%vanllladonut> cant t90 still cast recs
[2022-12-08 15:46:01] <itsgucci07> So in TG's now theres permanent cartography from start of game?
[2022-12-08 15:46:01] <%vanllladonut> or is that closed too
[2022-12-08 15:46:04] <%+jim_the_flim> I think it's to try to make it easier for people to single que team games
[2022-12-08 15:46:08] <+ChipMcnipper> What is a “drush”?
[2022-12-08 15:46:09] <+puasonelrasho> @puasonelrasho yea, it sounds good for random teams but premade are stronger now
[2022-12-08 15:46:23] <@%+AwwwwHamburgers> @vanllladonut nope, not during the event.  i'm sure he probably could afterwards
[2022-12-08 15:46:33] <%+jim_the_flim> people won't know what carto is soon
[2022-12-08 15:46:38] <truenotierra_arg> hello
[2022-12-08 15:46:43] <@%RoxyC> Would t90 wanna cast the recs after the event tho?v

[2022-12-08 16:35:06] <%$jonnyohneh_aoe2> imagine running into an xbox player on the ladder and loosing
[2022-12-08 16:35:09] <$PhatTeddy> RTS game on consoles  PepeLaugh
[2022-12-08 16:35:12] <fat_dragon_is_god> console players will play campaigns only :D
[2022-12-08 16:35:12] <@%SNM34> we can farm their elo
[2022-12-08 16:35:17] <%+Kate_AoE> its the same game?
[2022-12-08 16:35:20] <didierdecampe> Have you ever played AoMythology when you were younger ?
[2022-12-08 16:35:22] <$astigos2> if console players want to play that way then let them
[2022-12-08 16:35:23] <%+Kate_AoE> or a separate one?
[2022-12-08 16:35:24] <+davis_14_> dave controller player yt channel gonna explode

[2022-12-08 16:35:37] <%HappyLeaves> @Kate_AoE ui is different. same game
[2022-12-08 16:35:44] <@%tryptix_> You laugh but dave is better with controller than half of chat
[2022-12-08 16:35:49] <%+Kate_AoE> @Kate_AoE i mean if for example the ladder will be the same
[2022-12-08 16:35:54] <@%tryptix_> More than half, statistically speaking
[2022-12-08 16:36:01] <Silen5er> only Dota or LoL pro can retire comfortably
[2022-12-08 16:36:04] <%+kaladin_4> can't we connect keyboard mouse to console and play?
[2022-12-08 16:36:06] <%+Kate_AoE> @tryptix_ prolly most of us
[2022-12-08 16:36:07] <%+des5905> Why are you not going for MAA with viking Hera?

[2022-12-08 16:36:34] <%+zoltan_6> @tryptix_ half? I think he's the best controller player period
[2022-12-08 16:36:43] <%+bignips202> how the hell do you play age with a controller
[2022-12-08 16:36:52] <p_4_t_0> @bignips202 ask Dave LUL
[2022-12-08 16:36:54] <TheMikeNeto> ask dave
[2022-12-08 16:36:57] <+dijonaiss> ask dave
[2022-12-08 16:36:57] <+davis_14_> it makes sense to use controller. most gamers dont use mouse and keyboard playing on xbox
[2022-12-08 16:37:01] <GamingNoobNikaz> 10 apm
[2022-12-08 16:37:01] <%$pro_backseatgamer> ask dave
[2022-12-08 16:37:03] <@%tryptix_> @zoltan_6 sure, I'm saying better than half of this chat with their keyboard
[2022-12-08 16:37:08] <@%RoxyC> Ask dave
[2022-12-08 16:37:12] <+Percussionman> I can't even imagine how to play with a controller
[2022-12-08 16:37:18] <+yippip> it'll be a different queue for controller Vs keyboard and mouse
[2022-12-08 16:37:19] <%+zoltan_6> @tryptix_ oh hell yea
[2022-12-08 16:37:19] <%+kaladin_4> @davis_14_ those games are not fps/rts
[2022-12-08 16:37:19] <%BurtusMaximus> Is Meta now Drush / Scouts? Is MAA out of favor?
[2022-12-08 16:37:23] <Time2Pretend> controller but i think they have a dumbed down version of controls for casual games
[2022-12-08 16:37:28] <+nellis8692> i played aoe2 age of kings on ps2 with controller
[2022-12-08 16:37:30] <Time2Pretend> with 1 click instead of 2 for making buildings
[2022-12-08 16:37:35] <%HappyLeaves> @yippip how do you know that.
[2022-12-08 16:37:43] <$astigos2> when playing controller, there will likely be some AI to help you out doing stuff like auto-micro, auto-macro, auto-build, etc
[2022-12-08 16:37:45] <+davis_14_> you guys obviously haven't seen players using their fight and dance pads beating darksouls games
[2022-12-08 16:37:45] <fat_dragon_is_god> @BurtusMaximus nothing is out of favor. people play what they like

[2022-12-08 16:37:58] <+yippip> @happyleaves it'll have to be that way or it will be an absolute disaster
[2022-12-08 16:38:08] <+yippip> the entire elo scale will be destroyed
[2022-12-08 16:38:23] <Kellar_AoE> @yippip I heard its the same queue but different way to play the game
[2022-12-08 16:38:24] <+nellis8692> play aoe2 on xbox will be like just playing with a mouse
[2022-12-08 16:38:28] <fat_dragon_is_god> it will be smae queue PepeLaugh and controller players will get ai assistance
[2022-12-08 16:38:36] <p_4_t_0> @davis_14_ most weird stuff I've seen is a dude playing with a flute
[2022-12-08 16:38:45] <%+bignips202> maybe things like auto build vills?
[2022-12-08 16:38:47] <$PhatTeddy> how will the auto aim feature work when AoE2 comes to consoles? Kappa
[2022-12-08 16:38:49] <Kellar_AoE> u will have many auto options
[2022-12-08 16:38:51] <cerealkillas22> I play AOE on my Ocarina EZ
[2022-12-08 16:38:53] <Kellar_AoE> havent u seen the video on youtube?
[2022-12-08 16:38:56] <Kellar_AoE> i explains everything
[2022-12-08 16:38:59] <Kellar_AoE> it*
[2022-12-08 16:39:07] <+yippip> at the very least there will be an option to not queue up with crossplay
[2022-12-08 16:39:09] <%$pro_backseatgamer> auto everything button
[2022-12-08 16:39:11] <fat_dragon_is_god> yea. auto micro. auto macro. auto build. auto auto everything
[2022-12-08 16:39:13] <%vanllladonut> video is calle mbl auto everything
[2022-12-08 16:39:18] <%lucab_92> still waiting for aoe for game boy colour :(
[2022-12-08 16:39:21] <%+Juiced_Goose_AOE2> gonna make danny resign early again if you didnt throw all those berry vills. smart move
[2022-12-08 16:39:28] <Kellar_AoE> like if u build a house it will automaitcally select closest vil to build
[2022-12-08 16:39:45] <Kellar_AoE> and I think theres something with monks too

[2022-12-08 18:03:33] <+Diagrommo1> @Hera Playing Arena as Poles, when your enemy built Plenty of Halbs, Archers and couple Bombard Cannons, what would you build? I struggle with late games when it's IMP Age, players still have some gold and they can constantly produce units. I'm good in early rushes, cuz everythig is calculated, but when I'm defeated with my rush, still with resources ahead, I struggle with these things. What would you do?
[2022-12-08 18:03:34] <petitspoiscarottes> amazing game
