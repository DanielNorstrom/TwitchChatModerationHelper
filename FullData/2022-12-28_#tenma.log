[2022-12-28 15:47:35] <Klaymaniac> based = being correct on a subject that many will disagree with you on

[2022-12-28 15:47:44] <MisterYura> "based" has changed meanings several times in the past 10+ years
[2022-12-28 15:47:59] <APC_BONAPARTE> Based means "Based on truth", like someone says something that is truthful, but wouldn't usually say it because other people might not agree with it
[2022-12-28 15:48:03] <%Xravius> What I say = Based, what you say = cringe. Basically that
[2022-12-28 15:48:10] <+franknakano> based originally meant "you didn't give a damn" it is a compliment.
[2022-12-28 15:48:11] <+braincraft> You can tell you're getting old when you start blaming your unhappiness on the world getting worse instead of your growing awareness of how bad things always were.
[2022-12-28 15:48:15] <%robbyt_98> It is sort of a compliment. You are saying something against the majority of people.
[2022-12-28 15:48:17] <+Anxious_Millennial_Cowboy> based has kinda been diluted to the pointing can mean anything depending on the person
[2022-12-28 15:48:19] <just_a_voice> @Koholos i wouldn't say that, in the old internet, half of the time was simply page loading

[2022-12-28 15:57:45] <ProfJVoltsDiebstauriensus> That's not necessarily true. It depends on how many member of the general globalizing ideological cult get deep into whatever fandom. Some less than than others
[2022-12-28 15:57:49] <@%florbosagbag> Culture is toxic, gatherings of people above 100 are cursed to doom.
