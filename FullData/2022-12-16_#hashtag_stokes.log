[2022-12-16 11:06:20] <UtdFilipp> He has 7/8 idiots running around him, his legacy is safe
[2022-12-16 11:06:21] <cheaky_barstool> hes scored in how many ucl finals
[2022-12-16 11:06:23] <%+tdjs__> Messi has more goals in finals tho
[2022-12-16 11:06:24] <%sonyman123> yo
[2022-12-16 11:06:27] <%DadDy_CoOl7> messi is still one of the best players so is ronaldo but both fan bases are as shit as it gets KEKW
[2022-12-16 11:06:28] <+Crispo7> Messi been the best player at the tournament. Mbappe ghosted last 2 games he‚Äôs due a performance
[2022-12-16 11:06:28] <adhdinho> have you seen the messi interview when he was 10? he said that he'd want to be PE teacher LMAO

[2022-12-16 11:06:52] <+gav01987> Portugal won a euros too so the World Cup gives Messi the edge
[2022-12-16 11:07:11] <cheaky_barstool> messi's game was always gna last longer

[2022-12-16 11:07:34] <fire_in_the_boot> Messi also got those goals against utd at wembley
[2022-12-16 11:07:35] <%sonyman123> I respect but this is what we have seen in finals
[2022-12-16 11:07:35] <%appiie3> noted
[2022-12-16 11:07:35] <%Petrodoggz> people really forgetting that Ronaldo was genuinely unplayable up until a couple years ago, direspectful.

[2022-12-16 11:08:01] <%+tdjs__> I think for all the maradona pele lovers, like they didn‚Äôt have the club success messi has had
[2022-12-16 11:08:05] <ayzouu_by> is it true they're a releasing a flashback ronaldo soon?
[2022-12-16 11:08:07] <%rygn922> is already settled regardless if he wins or not
[2022-12-16 11:08:09] <19aadam> the game play any good today?

[2022-12-16 11:08:30] <UtdFilipp> facts, no point in debating anymore
[2022-12-16 11:08:33] <%youknowkg> argentina have to rely too much on messi,.mbappe could go quiet and france would still dominate dont see that with argentina
[2022-12-16 11:08:36] <%Petrodoggz> they need something, the debate will never end until one of them do something the other can't possibly do. WC win now would 100% do that
[2022-12-16 11:08:37] <+putyz1> @Petrodoggz I think for me, Messi always clear, but Ronaldo did the disrespect for himself, the interview, the comments, people start hating on him
[2022-12-16 11:08:43] <+pipegalleguillos> Messi clear from mbappe at his age, regardless the world cups
[2022-12-16 11:08:45] <@%FUTWIZ_NiKSNEB> nah who your playing looool

[2022-12-16 12:00:17] <+hnsst11> Do you feel like this year 2nd man press is way worse, i feel like it is constantly activating the wrong player, and not the one closest to the ball

[2022-12-16 13:10:56] <@%Zz_Bobi_zZ> messi acting career green light Pog
[2022-12-16 13:10:57] <kgdutchy> dutch pen was wack
[2022-12-16 13:10:57] <aman4311> I guess people use this same AI glitch to get top 200 on Squad battles as well
[2022-12-16 13:11:01] <%Zaetv> WIsh we had this ref in the quarter final
[2022-12-16 13:11:02] <%DadDy_CoOl7> @DadDy_CoOl7 They put an initial odds based on what they think and then it moves according to bets placed. And channel points is actually betting odds with 0% cut. Generally the betting websites take away like 20-25% of total amount placed just with the arbitrage.
[2022-12-16 13:11:04] <+StealthFatal> im just not sure what the goalie was supposed to do in that situation
[2022-12-16 13:11:06] <+putyz1> wtf :D all the pens are good calls, except polland
[2022-12-16 13:11:10] <i_DieHard> I want Argentina to win , but France's counter attacks are unreal
[2022-12-16 13:11:11] <browayzz> all of their 62 pens were rigged
[2022-12-16 13:11:21] <fezzouxd> how havent they fixed r9 yet? why is he a ginger
[2022-12-16 13:11:22] <@%Zz_Bobi_zZ> i might be in the minority but the croatia pen wasnt one for me
[2022-12-16 13:11:22] <%Zaetv> When Romero breaks mbappes legs
[2022-12-16 13:11:25] <%Zaetv> u heard it here first
[2022-12-16 13:11:33] <Ganj__> Luckily for everyone else u didn‚Äôt Pursue ur  dreams of being a ref @hashtag_stokes
[2022-12-16 13:11:39] <+StealthFatal> @Zz_Bobi_zZ i agree with you. what was the goalie supposed to do
[2022-12-16 13:11:41] <DareToBelieve91> giroud does what Netherlands did but france better
[2022-12-16 13:11:46] <%+ibra_yare20> they were soft nonetheless, wouldn't say they were not pens for sure
[2022-12-16 13:11:53] <%$davidholding28> @putyz1 How you work that out some of them wasn‚Äôt even a penalty
[2022-12-16 13:11:54] <gabrielkendrick> croatia pen 100% a pen
[2022-12-16 13:12:04] <gabrielkendrick> so was netherlands
[2022-12-16 13:12:05] <%DadDy_CoOl7> all the pens were soft 100%
[2022-12-16 13:12:05] <+Fl0r1sh> nah pen against croatia is clear
[2022-12-16 13:12:10] <kbreezy8967_> croatia was a clear pen
[2022-12-16 13:12:14] <gabrielkendrick> only poland one is not a pen
[2022-12-16 13:12:17] <+putyz1> @davidholding28 which one is not a penalty?:D
[2022-12-16 13:12:37] <popzgaming> just for the fact the keeper went for the ball and missed it
[2022-12-16 13:12:42] <@%Zz_Bobi_zZ> never intended to foul or attack just tried to save teh ball and he ran into him FeelsBadMan
[2022-12-16 13:12:47] <ahsantariqmajeed> keeper was out of line with leg out
[2022-12-16 13:12:51] <%+ibra_yare20> it's those kinda situations where you wouldn't complain if the ref the doesn't give it too
[2022-12-16 13:13:00] <+sceinz> All pens but Poland were pens idk how people are complaining tbh
[2022-12-16 13:13:03] <+thejasperb> what is the croatia keeper supposed to do, let him score open goal
[2022-12-16 13:13:10] <kianpnefcc> How‚Äôs gameplay?
[2022-12-16 13:13:11] <kbreezy8967_> pokes shhh
[2022-12-16 13:13:14] <+yusuf_1310> Keeper collided with him
[2022-12-16 13:13:16] <@%DrNightWatch> im Argentina fan boy as it gets and I don't think that's a pen honestly
[2022-12-16 13:13:17] <ahsantariqmajeed> even keepers are saying it was a pen
[2022-12-16 13:13:17] <+StealthFatal> its like momentum wasnt taken into consideration. alvarez even chipped
[2022-12-16 13:13:21] <+Fl0r1sh> it's not even about the pens, the refs who manage the games of argentina rule more in favour of them imo
[2022-12-16 13:13:22] <%coys600> nah it was kinda wreckless
[2022-12-16 13:13:24] <%+brianmcgee99> Yeah and he has to get it lol
[2022-12-16 13:13:28] <@%Zz_Bobi_zZ> ratta
[2022-12-16 13:13:31] <+yusuf_1310> Gotta win the ball
[2022-12-16 13:13:35] <%DadDy_CoOl7> all the argentine pens were soft, some were pens in modern football poland one wasn't just pen
[2022-12-16 13:13:36] <@%DrNightWatch> only thing is that lovren cleared it where Alvarez would have been had he not been tripped
[2022-12-16 13:13:36] <%+geordiepharaoh> What's up bro
[2022-12-16 13:13:38] <gabrielkendrick> busquets has retired from internationals btw
[2022-12-16 13:13:40] <nRichh_> Yeah but the keeper has to get the ball
[2022-12-16 13:13:44] <%cj_nsza> the contact was after alvarez shot the ball the keeper couldn't move away tho
[2022-12-16 13:13:44] <+thagreatsalameh> Anywhere else on the pitch it‚Äôs a foul so it‚Äôs the right call
