[2022-12-10 00:35:05] <!%+CrawlyCrawl> is the headhunter thing a new rare mod?
[2022-12-10 00:35:56] <Da_Rock_LP> the pick up radius from the league currency is just WAY too small i think @nugiyen
[2022-12-10 00:36:02] <ragepowerr> @nugiyen wtf guys in gneeral spam empower and enlighten i think even lower lvls they did:D

[2022-12-10 01:18:18] <Da_Rock_LP> they just gave us the loot nervs back, to prevent reddit from weining to much LUL
[2022-12-10 01:18:20] <Drallix> anyone know why my filter sounds aren't working
[2022-12-10 01:18:24] <Ignartz> Saw a post of someone finding a 6 link in act2. Maybe sockets are broken? Considering the 4 socket shield?
[2022-12-10 01:18:26] <!%+CrawlyCrawl> and empower lul
[2022-12-10 01:18:37] <+Liviyn> There's a 4-socket shield on reddit so maybe they did
[2022-12-10 01:19:17] <%dicemanxviii> the inverse of Kalandra start
[2022-12-10 01:19:17] <%+Weero> pepeLaugh imagine if a 4 socket squire dropped
[2022-12-10 01:22:50] <!%KayH9> It looks burnt

[2022-12-10 01:23:47] <prumpoe> chamber of innocence
[2022-12-10 01:23:51] <%dicemanxviii> how do u even revert something like that? Hmm
[2022-12-10 01:24:09] <!%+CrawlyCrawl> might just be a sanctum thing
[2022-12-10 01:24:18] <%+Pastor_J> It's really good that if sockets are broken, its favouring players
[2022-12-10 01:24:20] <!%+CrawlyCrawl> I got a ilvl 24 6socket from there
[2022-12-10 01:24:32] <%+Pastor_J> Could you imagine the backlash>
[2022-12-10 01:24:35] <%+Weero> @CrawlyCrawl no, its been happening outside of sanctum as well, I got a 6 socket in act 1
[2022-12-10 01:25:00] <!%+CrawlyCrawl> @CrawlyCrawl LuL
[2022-12-10 01:25:19] <%+Weero> @CrawlyCrawl PEPW and no, it wasnt a tabby
[2022-12-10 01:25:20] <TheLogicFan> how do you save up rooms?
[2022-12-10 01:25:20] <%dicemanxviii> I feel bad for them now. Thats 2 leagues in a row.
[2022-12-10 01:26:15] <%dicemanxviii> scuffed loot
[2022-12-10 01:26:29] <%+Weero> nonono, this isnt scuffed loot, this is BROKEN loot
[2022-12-10 01:26:31] <%+Weero> PEPW
[2022-12-10 01:26:36] <+ParseThis> it could easily be on purpose too
[2022-12-10 01:26:36] <Sn00z> well it makes it alot more intersting tbh
[2022-12-10 01:26:49] <+Coorsking3000> 4 socket shield incoming!
[2022-12-10 01:27:06] <%+Pastor_J> As long as the loot is good for PoE 2, it's fine
[2022-12-10 01:27:19] <Da_Rock_LP> loot is much better now then last league start
[2022-12-10 01:27:57] <%dicemanxviii> Well , imagine the backlash if they need to revert some things.
[2022-12-10 01:28:29] <Drallix> this has to be one of the buggiest leagues in a while right? like nothing game breaking but there's so many item glitches and UI stuff missing
[2022-12-10 01:28:30] <%Xynal> so far i really like the league mechanic. i barely progressed through the acts because of it LUL
[2022-12-10 01:29:07] <Da_Rock_LP> that's why i meant earlyier, that they pumped the loot a bit up so that less people complain. and they don't have the same shit show like last league
[2022-12-10 01:30:15] <%dicemanxviii> If people start trading for the fat 4 links , then ... "Sorry this was unintended."

[2022-12-10 01:47:54] <!%warfirev> I case anyone was wondering, -40% mov speed in sactum feels bad KEKW
[2022-12-10 01:49:08] <%Dying_Sun_> @warfirev there is a +60% aswell  called hare KEKLEO

[2022-12-10 01:51:31] <+AunupB> I'd say coins if you're expecting progress, then you can purchase boons
[2022-12-10 01:52:12] <%+olivertrojahn> how do you upgrade that place?
[2022-12-10 01:54:23] <!%KayH9> I like that it’s a separate room to decide. So we don’t die in maps
[2022-12-10 01:54:46] <!%KayH9> I don’t like the coin pick up

[2022-12-10 02:09:37] <!%KayH9> AlkSpin
[2022-12-10 02:10:18] <@%DerangedM8> true, have to see how it is in maps though, if xp is still that much
[2022-12-10 02:10:32] <@%DerangedM8> in comparison to the xp you get while lvling
[2022-12-10 02:11:31] <%+Pastor_J> It's about gameplay feel and pacing.
[2022-12-10 02:11:37] <%+Pastor_J> It does feel a bit off
[2022-12-10 02:12:13] <@%DerangedM8> maybe a bit too common
[2022-12-10 02:12:18] <!%warfirev> There are a couple of nice awards, that should not be in story
[2022-12-10 02:12:26] <!%warfirev> put them in maps
[2022-12-10 02:13:52] <%+Pastor_J> TABULA!!!

[2022-12-10 10:26:19] <%delCypher> you need to do the fellshrine quest. after that start a new run and you can lock the relic

[2022-12-10 10:58:09] <SuprMeatDude> yeah since there's no meta progression you need the vendor
[2022-12-10 10:58:20] <PurpleDropBear> does the vendor just randomly show up between stages or do you select the zone with him/her?
[2022-12-10 10:58:24] <+treeshark> see vendors fairly often not too much complaint with the league mechanic this time

[2022-12-10 11:17:54] <Rreico> I'm playing cold dot and about to fight the fourth floor boss
[2022-12-10 11:18:00] <nemesea66> you can play melee if you convert to frost
[2022-12-10 11:18:16] <v44ld> i like how hard it is
[2022-12-10 11:18:22] <Rreico> I just move around non stop and they die lol
[2022-12-10 11:18:25] <%Xynal> i'm playing cold dot, it's great YEP
[2022-12-10 11:18:25] <Madivnar> totems/balistas are so good for league mechanic
[2022-12-10 11:18:28] <+Tsaebahcus007> ascendant cold dot is a bit more mobile with raider ascendancy
[2022-12-10 11:18:34] <+Tsaebahcus007> and perma phasing
[2022-12-10 11:19:07] <stessian> Honestly I'll likely switch to brands if it's this bad still in a couple weeks
[2022-12-10 11:19:07] <Rreico> I have 14% move speed atm lol, build is just made for the mechanic imo
[2022-12-10 11:20:27] <stessian> Volcanic fissure is too good though

[2022-12-10 11:24:17] <Rreico> @SuprMeatDude nah, the bosses typically only last maybe 20s at most.
[2022-12-10 11:24:18] <%Vosy1984> the guy hat dashes and blinks is so slow that he barely moves @nugiyen
[2022-12-10 11:24:47] <SuprMeatDude> @Rreico doesn't matter if you can't dodge their attacks
[2022-12-10 11:25:30] <Rreico> @SuprMeatDude Atm I have around 400 resolve and 300 inspiration, only got hit by the 3rd boss once.
[2022-12-10 11:26:14] <%Vosy1984> @nugiyen there's no way curses remain the same next league
[2022-12-10 11:26:26] <%Vosy1984> I suggest having fun with them this league
[2022-12-10 11:26:40] <%Vosy1984> if cold dot is made for the mechanic, let me ntroduce you to temporal chains, withered, hindered, debilitated league mechanic KEKW
[2022-12-10 11:27:13] <SuprMeatDude> @Rreico xdd i thought you said  have 14% move speed atm lol, build is just (not) made for the mechanic imo

[2022-12-10 11:28:51] <%TheLauron> hey nugi, what flask prefixes do you want on PF?
[2022-12-10 11:29:11] <Rreico> @SuprMeatDude You good dude, they die so quickly I don't need 30%+ ms yet and if I do rip idc I really enjoy the league mechanic.

[2022-12-10 11:37:40] <+Wrannec> The new profession stuff is just *chefs kiss*
[2022-12-10 11:38:29] <%Vosy1984> after 2 years of lockdowns, good games are barging in
[2022-12-10 11:38:29] <+Wrannec> Yea it feels awesome. Herbalism and alchemy for me at least have been a blast
[2022-12-10 11:39:06] <+Sketchlin> my alch explodes every time i try do discover :(
[2022-12-10 11:39:12] <Rreico> @Wrannec I agree, I was surprised at how much depth they gave the profs after so many years of neglect.
[2022-12-10 11:39:21] <%+Pastor_J> One of the best things about the new WoW xpac is that I can play PoE this weekend and not fall behind.
[2022-12-10 11:39:26] <Friedorfertilized> D4 is closer than i ever think
[2022-12-10 11:39:40] <+Wrannec> @Pastor_J Yes so much this. You dont feel left behind by not playing every single day for 8+ hours
[2022-12-10 11:39:41] <%+Pastor_J> It's out in June I thjink
[2022-12-10 11:40:06] <+Wrannec> @Rreico 100% agreed

[2022-12-10 11:43:24] <Odoakar> d4 will have a fuckin battle pass
[2022-12-10 11:43:36] <+Wrannec> @Odoakar Why is that bad ?
[2022-12-10 11:43:45] <+Wrannec> that D4 will have a battle pass
[2022-12-10 11:44:10] <Odoakar> because its a 70 euro game. and its blizz
[2022-12-10 11:44:15] <+Bragez> ngl the more Ive seen about D4 the less hope I have. I mean it looks pretty etc. but that passive tree... Makes me so sad
[2022-12-10 11:44:19] <+Wrannec> Then dont buy the battle pass
[2022-12-10 11:44:33] <SBCYugi> monkaH
[2022-12-10 11:44:38] <Odoakar> ah yes, then dont buz it argument
[2022-12-10 11:44:53] <+Wrannec> @nugiyen I gotta say, the new Volcanic slam skill makes me want to make a Chieftain
[2022-12-10 11:45:24] <+Wrannec> @Odoakar I mean, how does it affect you that D4 have a battlepass? Vote with your wallet
[2022-12-10 11:46:30] <+Bragez> the gameplay looks smooth. but every time I see that skill tree, it makes me cry
[2022-12-10 11:46:34] <stessian> It's Blizzard. They don't give a shit about the game. Just the money
[2022-12-10 11:46:48] <+Bragez> its literally a watered down D3 tree
[2022-12-10 11:46:58] <+Bragez> where they have moved most runes onto items
[2022-12-10 11:47:04] <OGPetersenLoc> Decided with Immortal that D4 is dead for me .. not buying any blizz shit
[2022-12-10 11:47:06] <Friedorfertilized> feels like blizz doesn't know how to monetize their games if its not monthly subscription
[2022-12-10 11:47:08] <+Bragez> all skills
[2022-12-10 11:47:17] <+Bragez> have 2 choices
[2022-12-10 11:47:20] <%MrBonkeyDollax> Pog have they released the full tree!
[2022-12-10 11:47:23] <Rreico> I mean they have basically a kiracs vault and cosmetic MTX, haven't seen anything else, did I miss something?
[2022-12-10 11:47:23] <%dicemanxviii> the game suck yo money , so yah they like the game,
[2022-12-10 11:47:24] <+Bragez> literally 2 choices
[2022-12-10 11:47:27] <%+Pastor_J> I don't understand the monetisation problem, it's exactly like PoE's except a box cost
[2022-12-10 11:47:32] <stessian> Well, sure... The devs probably enjoy it, but the people calling the shots couldn't care less. They only want to squeeze every bit of money out of people that they can
[2022-12-10 11:47:32] <+Bragez> thats what I mean
[2022-12-10 11:47:46] <%Vosy1984> there were hoices in d3?
[2022-12-10 11:47:49] <%+Pastor_J> am I missing something?
[2022-12-10 11:47:53] <%Vosy1984> choices*
[2022-12-10 11:47:58] <+Wrannec> @Pastor_J I guess its because PoE is free and thats the main difference. But since its cosmetics only in the battle pass, then I dont see what the problem is

[2022-12-10 11:48:13] <%Vosy1984> the choice of not playing probably
[2022-12-10 11:48:24] <%+funta90> D4 Skilltree is actually worse. even less choice.
[2022-12-10 11:48:27] <Friedorfertilized> Coisonous Poncotion PepoDance
[2022-12-10 11:48:36] <+Wrannec> @funta90 Compared to D3? That is just not true lol
[2022-12-10 11:48:43] <+Bragez> if you look at lets say Whirlwind, theres a WW node, behind that there is a generic node for WW, behind that you have choice A. and Choice B. which modifies the skill. @nugiyen
[2022-12-10 11:48:48] <v44ld> milking money
[2022-12-10 11:48:58] <%TheLauron> HUCK MY BOY
[2022-12-10 11:49:00] <+Wrannec> @Bragez You do know the skill tree is not final, right ?
[2022-12-10 11:49:02] <%+Pastor_J> @Pastor_J Sure, but have you seen how much cosmetics cost in PoE? They are so expensive compared to similar in most other f2p games.
[2022-12-10 11:49:03] <%+angeryhog> i dont see no huck buffs
[2022-12-10 11:49:12] <+Wrannec> @Pastor_J No I agree with you 100% :D
[2022-12-10 11:49:19] <@%+dadish> Collectors Edition not even having the game  KEKL
[2022-12-10 11:49:25] <stessian> Wait, they released images of the skill tree?
[2022-12-10 11:49:26] <+Bragez> @Wrannec ofc its not finished yet. but what they have shown so far, is literally worse than d3
[2022-12-10 11:49:30] <%Vosy1984> how do you have him in maps if not unlocked WeirdCoffee
[2022-12-10 11:49:35] <%Wakadodo> @dadish ?????????????????
[2022-12-10 11:49:39] <Lenaios> @Wrannec this gets said about many things and never in the history of gaming has anything changed before launch
[2022-12-10 11:49:40] <%Wakadodo> fo rela?
[2022-12-10 11:49:54] <+Wrannec> @Lenaios No, things NEVER change before a release, you are right
[2022-12-10 11:50:01] <Lenaios> yes i know
[2022-12-10 11:50:03] <%+Pastor_J> Nope, everyone who plays Diablo is saying D4 looks pretty good and a massive improvement over D3
[2022-12-10 11:50:18] <+Bragez> @Lenaios @Wrannec alkXD
[2022-12-10 11:50:21] <@%+dadish> "Note: The Diablo IV Limited Collector’s Box does not include a copy of the game—this is a separate purchase."
[2022-12-10 11:50:23] <+Wrannec> @Pastor_J Yep, also what I saw from some of the biggest critiques and doubters of D4
[2022-12-10 11:50:24] <paololaff> why you are not using a weapon?
[2022-12-10 11:50:38] <+Wrannec> @paololaff Because he is a flask man!
[2022-12-10 11:50:58] <+Bragez> the gameplay looks very nice. the graphics aesthetics looks amazing
[2022-12-10 11:51:06] <OGPetersenLoc> @Pastor_J creators who hope for another banger ... atleast in my circle of friends people are very cautious
[2022-12-10 11:51:16] <razers91> how do you deal with mana on this build
[2022-12-10 11:51:20] <%elninocro> hey Vosy1984 do u have game still installed?
[2022-12-10 11:51:20] <+Bragez> I just really hope they expand on the skill tree
[2022-12-10 11:51:23] <stessian> But if the skill tree is limited, to me the replay ability is dead.
[2022-12-10 11:51:36] <%Vosy1984> @elninocro lost ark? no
[2022-12-10 11:51:37] <%elninocro> shit
[2022-12-10 11:51:45] <stessian> That's why d3 was never that fun. You get to choose 3 different ways to play one character, that's it
[2022-12-10 11:51:47] <%Vosy1984> why?
[2022-12-10 11:51:54] <%+Hoerman__> I hope the demonic angelic choice is actually prominent. I stead of build a is angelic and build b is demonic etc
[2022-12-10 11:52:05] <%+Pastor_J> @Pastor_J Oh absolutely. It's not going to be another D2. But D2 is in the top 5 greatest games of all time. That's not a bar to be measured against IMO.
[2022-12-10 11:52:09] <+Wrannec> @stessian I mean, how many ways do you want to be able to play a character before its ok to you? Just curious
[2022-12-10 11:52:17] <%Wakadodo> nugiDisco
[2022-12-10 11:52:39] <Andrewpol12> do you think southbound gloves works with frozen legion?
[2022-12-10 11:52:57] <%Vosy1984> elninocro why?
[2022-12-10 11:53:07] <+Wrannec> This new Hades looks a lot like PoE Kappa
[2022-12-10 11:53:10] <stessian> Well... to put it in perspective, I've been playing PoE for 8 years? and I've played Toxic rain dozens of times. All but 3 were different?
[2022-12-10 11:53:52] <%+Hoerman__> did you guys all see the hades 2 trailer?
[2022-12-10 11:53:59] <stessian> With a limited skill tree there's no skill expression like there is with PoE
[2022-12-10 11:54:25] <%+Hoerman__> how did they get a female voice that's so similar to the mail Protagonist voice
[2022-12-10 11:54:37] <%+Hoerman__> male

[2022-12-10 13:39:25] <@%DerangedM8> totally understandable LUL
[2022-12-10 13:39:49] <@%DerangedM8> i sit too little in my chair to spend 1500 buckeroos on it

[2022-12-10 13:40:50] <@%DerangedM8> i do have one at work tho, i can really recommend one
[2022-12-10 13:41:13] <%+Evergrinding> ikea Markus is pretty well regarded
[2022-12-10 13:41:52] <@%DerangedM8> that's the one i use at home, no herman miller quality, but really does the job pretty well indeed
[2022-12-10 13:41:54] <%+Adelbertt> pog first oil i get is black!
[2022-12-10 13:41:55] <eucoco> yeah i have heard ikea got some really good ones
[2022-12-10 13:41:59] <smokeejoe> Steelcase makes great chairs too.. the Leap is solid. not sure on price but they ain't cheap either
[2022-12-10 13:42:37] <Recyclopz> I have a Steelcase and can recommend.
[2022-12-10 13:42:40] <stessian> Is there an easy way to farm astramentis

[2022-12-10 13:45:02] <SollSmottoh> @stessian you can check out the wiki page for where the div card can drop specifically for astramentis. Looks like Museum, relic chambers and reliquary
[2022-12-10 13:45:22] <@%DerangedM8> @nugiyen did you buy a refurb, or new?

[2022-12-10 13:47:35] <%Betty_is_Best> yes, Frozen Legion is solid. really strong damage but can be a little inconsistent

[2022-12-10 14:45:35] <%HeffU> I do think the sanctum could use some more cool positive buffs than it currently gives us
[2022-12-10 14:45:35] <Agatio_> you get destroyed but you also get more powerful, it's more like altars
[2022-12-10 14:45:39] <TheLogicFan> how dare they complain without playing an entire different game. :p
[2022-12-10 14:45:46] <%Dying_Sun_> yes but in hades you have actually responsive movement...
[2022-12-10 14:46:01] <+Headskull3> or you just do it fresh start in like 20 minutes
[2022-12-10 14:46:08] <@%DerangedM8> they should give a option of 3 boons to choose from

[2022-12-10 16:07:19] <Truelisko> any idea if he scales with heist levels?

[2022-12-10 16:07:57] <+LtSmokin> Nugi kidnapped Huck D:
[2022-12-10 16:08:03] <Ruuno> hmm.. now to figure out if he uses his gear.
[2022-12-10 16:08:03] <+DracoGideon> is there altas node that gives you huck?
[2022-12-10 16:08:15] <+DracoGideon> :O

[2022-12-10 16:08:52] <jamesmccay123> Huck similar to Diablo’s Templar?
[2022-12-10 16:08:58] <AntiFusion> can you give him juice?
[2022-12-10 16:09:02] <+DracoGideon> get einhar then you have a 3-man party :)
[2022-12-10 16:09:04] <Xenonic_Gaming> Can you spec your atlas for 100% Huck uptime?
[2022-12-10 16:09:14] <Ruuno> you can combine him with einhar for more active buffs LUL
[2022-12-10 16:09:17] <Ruuno> einhar also has a similar buff right?
[2022-12-10 16:09:49] <%0bscureTTV> judging by the wikis his buff isnt a static value so i guess it scales with hucks level progression?
[2022-12-10 16:10:21] <SakataaGintokiii> Huck gives a 10% exp boost
[2022-12-10 16:10:38] <SakataaGintokiii> passive
[2022-12-10 16:10:40] <%0bscureTTV> i was specifically talking about combat ready mb
[2022-12-10 16:10:42] <Ruuno> maybe its like a warcry
[2022-12-10 16:10:48] <%+ArcadiusXIV> looks like a warcry
[2022-12-10 16:10:56] <Gato_vzla> hello, Huck it gives te buff?
[2022-12-10 16:11:03] <+WinnieTheWhor> He has to use the skill i think, check the wiki, its the same one he applies in a heist
[2022-12-10 16:11:18] <Ruuno> @nugiyen  have you gotten any woke gems from the maven bosses?
[2022-12-10 16:11:29] <Gato_vzla> it say on the map mods is heist I guess it will be the same

[2022-12-10 16:39:06] <+Thegreekog> Nugi have you ever tried to roast your own coffee?  I did it for a while and the coffee was the best I've ever had.

[2022-12-10 16:39:09] <Nubatack> *coffee drink
[2022-12-10 16:39:12] <+monitus0> I just ordered another mix of coffees from a Swedish roaster that does micro lots from around the world and mostly light roasts that I like.
[2022-12-10 16:39:15] <+blindmen2> MacCoffe 3in1 is best
[2022-12-10 16:39:15] <%dicemanxviii> omg instant coffee , only in EU ...
[2022-12-10 16:39:17] <thejewk83> You need to get on Black Cat Coffee Nugi,  really good roastery and good prices
[2022-12-10 16:39:19] <+Headskull3> have you tried out roasting your own coffee?
[2022-12-10 16:39:20] <+monitus0> Good coffee zeplaQtea
[2022-12-10 16:39:21] <+Beariserious> do you freshly grind when you have whole beans?
[2022-12-10 16:39:26] <TheFrostUA> @nugiyen there is such thing as a "good instant coffee" it's called "a mediocre coffee"
[2022-12-10 16:39:26] <Meliea_EU> i like some instant coffee, but there are cheap ones which taste disgusting sour
[2022-12-10 16:39:28] <Toaster_of_Girian> it's more of a coffee flavoured drink
[2022-12-10 16:39:35] <@%DerangedM8> mediocre coffee still better than no coffee YEP
[2022-12-10 16:39:36] <%+illoomenated> what kind of process in instant coffee? i hope they dont put sugar and corn starch in it
[2022-12-10 16:40:03] <Kelvarion_> instant coffee is dry frozen
[2022-12-10 16:40:08] <%dicemanxviii> im not sure instant coffee is really even coffee
[2022-12-10 16:40:10] <Meliea_EU> instant coffee better than none, but rarely there are good tasting ones
[2022-12-10 16:40:10] <SpiritEX> shitty normal coffee is better than the best instant coffee KEKW
[2022-12-10 16:40:12] <+ExpedientFalcon> Workplace I used to work at kept buying coffee that smelled like cat piss. Didn't taste all that great either.

[2022-12-10 16:43:44] <Teh_Unicron> think terraria with vikings

[2022-12-10 16:43:49] <+Team_Hushkal> do you plan to swap out of pconc?
[2022-12-10 16:43:51] <Teh_Unicron> some sandbox elements with boss progression
[2022-12-10 16:43:51] <%Dying_Sun_> if valheim was an mmo i would play it all day
[2022-12-10 16:43:56] <Kelvarion_> craft, grind, craft better stuff, grind more. some combat

[2022-12-10 16:44:19] <+LtSmokin> I can't wait for the Dune survival game in development
[2022-12-10 16:44:20] <Perkele_Itse> You start as a new naked viking and working your way up the gear and base upgrades, defend you base from invasions and kill bosses
[2022-12-10 16:44:30] <@%DerangedM8> KB dream Prayge
[2022-12-10 16:44:46] <%Dying_Sun_> @LtSmokin 3+ years minimum, i am in their discord since a few months they are doing the groundwork right now

[2022-12-10 16:45:05] <soul_d3> valheim in nutshel  :30% building/farming 30%exploration fighting  30% mining for upgrades 10%chil
[2022-12-10 16:45:18] <ResurrectionByElection> have you seen the new breach vfx, holy shit Kreygasm
[2022-12-10 16:45:22] <+LtSmokin> @LtSmokin I was thinking alpha access in like early/mid 2024 personally

[2022-12-10 16:45:59] <+LtSmokin> @Dying_Sun_ no shot they wait till the game is 100% finished to release it these days LUL
[2022-12-10 16:46:18] <+iza1814> Do you have to enter and click the book to stack rooms, or is there a faster way?
[2022-12-10 16:46:51] <Andrewpol12> the more i play sanctum the more i like it
[2022-12-10 16:46:51] <+LtSmokin> @iza1814 yup, you have to select the 'store room' once you get succ'd in
[2022-12-10 16:47:09] <%Dying_Sun_> @LtSmokin im just saying, since the game awards people seem to think that they have more than just 2 trailers. They don't. Remember games like atlas? Godlike trailers aswell...
[2022-12-10 16:47:12] <Kelvarion_> how can ppl be hyped for a game that is 2-3 years away and you know next to nothing about it... I hope it will be good, sure, but hyped?

[2022-12-10 16:51:23] <%HughLana> you're competing with other variety streamers at release too
[2022-12-10 16:51:25] <%Jellooze> if you want to max out the moneys you kinda have too
[2022-12-10 16:51:28] <desettiger1010> yessir
[2022-12-10 16:51:29] <Ruuno> @nugiyen  sometimes it works for you if you play a game after people played it. then you get the viewers that want to see someone play and react to a game they played
[2022-12-10 16:51:36] <SpiritEX> but u cant spoil the game for ur friend if ur not the first one to play
[2022-12-10 16:51:40] <%axlex2> youtubes 2 Headskull3
[2022-12-10 16:51:45] <octavianist> plenty of variety streamers that play older stuff
[2022-12-10 16:51:50] <%+ArcadiusXIV> just look at Ezekeiel_III
[2022-12-10 16:51:50] <+LtSmokin> yea, he has an established community NODDERS
[2022-12-10 16:52:01] <%Dying_Sun_> quin is easy entertainment he probably does not even need to play games at all, binging tiktoks would fit him aswell xd
[2022-12-10 16:52:03] <@%DerangedM8> they watch mostly for his reactions to shit, that's what makes him great at it
[2022-12-10 16:52:08] <%+NovaOdin> @ArcadiusXIV The master of sloppy seconds zekeFLIRT
[2022-12-10 16:52:13] <%stanzwar> maybe I should do some variety streaming when im off work haha

[2022-12-10 16:52:55] <+Arakki> likeI still have GTTA V to play
[2022-12-10 16:52:59] <+LtSmokin> It's all FOMO

[2022-12-10 16:53:03] <%stanzwar> we need to go back to the old ways
[2022-12-10 16:53:09] <%stanzwar> yeah watching you play darkwood was super fun
[2022-12-10 16:53:12] <%Dying_Sun_> darkwood is incredible
[2022-12-10 16:53:22] <%Dying_Sun_> ever played this war of mine?
[2022-12-10 16:53:32] <%Dying_Sun_> similar vibes
[2022-12-10 16:53:34] <@%DerangedM8> quake is free with amazon prime right now, i've never played it before cuz it was just slightly after my time. But my god am i having fun with it

[2022-12-10 16:53:46] <%+NovaOdin> I've played the board game version of This War of Mine
[2022-12-10 16:53:47] <veenlijk> how is the mechanic?
[2022-12-10 16:53:57] <BryanThePirate> I mean the news cycle, even for games is like 24 hrs, unless it's especially popular. Ultimately it's a choice if you want to always ride the peaks or are okay with riding the lows.
[2022-12-10 16:54:21] <desettiger1010> wife and I  playing through divinity original sin first time, game is awesome, wish there were more local co op rpgs

[2022-12-10 16:55:49] <BryanThePirate> @Kelvarion_ If you're a content creator as a profession, especially with VoD contant then it absolutely matters when you play a game.

[2022-12-10 16:56:49] <%axlex2> people love following hype and hype is 99% of the time dumb
[2022-12-10 16:56:51] <Mathod> But you can make it doing it your own way
[2022-12-10 16:57:05] <BryanThePirate> I'm not saying it can't be done other ways, but there's always going to be an optimal way.
[2022-12-10 16:57:11] <Bewrnl> playing a game on release is important for big streamers - as smaller streamer you'd have to compete against that, not always the best way.
[2022-12-10 16:57:12] <veenlijk> it can be easy to just follow
[2022-12-10 16:57:21] <Mathod> Its like playing the Meta PoE build and figthing for the items you need Kappa
[2022-12-10 16:57:24] <%axlex2> you just said big unique streamer dont need to follow hype
[2022-12-10 16:57:25] <%PRONE> it's super hard to grow as a variety streamer but the successful ones have a higher ceiling
[2022-12-10 16:57:28] <%axlex2> so let the little guys go for the hype
[2022-12-10 16:57:31] <+LtSmokin> nonstreamers telling streamers how to stream COPIUM
[2022-12-10 16:57:32] <+sidviciouspro> i only follow the whores of people
[2022-12-10 16:57:43] <@%DerangedM8> for big streamers, talking about 15k plus hype is good, streamers under 5 to 10k get fucked
[2022-12-10 16:57:53] <%axlex2> i've seen some 1k viewer hosts to new poe streamers
[2022-12-10 16:57:58] <%axlex2> it occasionally passes down
[2022-12-10 16:58:02] <SpiritEX> but when game is 2months old and everyone already finished it no1 will watch it unless you're a big streamer that already has people to watch
[2022-12-10 16:58:02] <+Blxcktwiiix> i can't pick up the crafting recipe in crimson township xD
[2022-12-10 16:58:07] <%PSL225> yeah small PoE content creators on launch have way less viewers than end of league
[2022-12-10 16:58:08] <DrOwlMoon> it also depends on if you are a gameplay centric streamer of a personality centric one
[2022-12-10 16:58:17] [Notification] R4TCH3T subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 83 months! [no hype?]

[2022-12-10 16:59:49] <@%R4TCH3T> i mean you have to remember being a small streamer, unless people are specifically looking for a small stream, no one is gonna scroll for 30 minutes to find you, ever.
[2022-12-10 16:59:50] <veenlijk> wait rly? they got around to it?

[2022-12-10 17:02:18] <ResurrectionByElection> It's because marketing machines imprinted this into ppl's minds TheIlluminati
[2022-12-10 17:02:25] <THEWIZARDFIST> played cyberpunk a year after it came out and it was amazing
[2022-12-10 17:02:26] <+ryunbound> Even cyberpunk, i played day 1 and loved it.
[2022-12-10 17:02:27] <%axlex2> cashflow doesnt permit that often times, if cyberpunk didnt have preorders and upfront sales it would have been abandoned instead of updated
[2022-12-10 17:02:28] <HumbleJanitorRemZ> I played when it came out, didn't have much fun; I played it again a month ago, it thorughly enjoyed it

[2022-12-10 17:02:53] <@%R4TCH3T> feels kinda wrong that consumers have to pay for a bad game so they want to fix it tho
[2022-12-10 17:02:53] <donshepard> i played on pc and it was a bit jank but it was pretty great

[2022-12-10 17:08:54] <+A_Mule> chat makes him angry and he yells at them
[2022-12-10 17:08:56] <+LtSmokin> talks about his fake wife
[2022-12-10 17:08:56] <+Kantern> basically sums it up
[2022-12-10 17:08:59] <ToaVee> bald angry man

[2022-12-10 17:09:06] <Fair_Folk> talks about poop and cum
[2022-12-10 17:09:07] <Jagt_69> he plays the game for 15 minutes then puts badlands chugs on for 15 minutes repeat
[2022-12-10 17:09:09] <+maximillianbongsmith> his whole stream is dedicated to a joke about him having a wife and family
[2022-12-10 17:09:09] <veenlijk> bald angry meme dad?
[2022-12-10 17:09:10] <+Kantern> have a fake family and dogs
[2022-12-10 17:09:11] <ResurrectionByElection> he just plays them
[2022-12-10 17:09:18] <ResurrectionByElection> not much to it
[2022-12-10 17:09:21] <Ginnie_> nah hes going pretty tryhard sometimes too but most of the time in a fun way? idk
[2022-12-10 17:09:22] <Deszer> he seeks out challenging stuff
[2022-12-10 17:09:23] <%PRONE> he's actually really good at games so that helps, but then he likes to take the piss out of chat a lot like he tells chatters he fucked their mom and stuff

[2022-12-10 17:09:42] <ToaVee> either super try hard or plays a meme thing
[2022-12-10 17:09:42] <BalderSideSwag> yeah he is a bit of a memer but also actually good at games
[2022-12-10 17:09:42] <saucymcskipster> Its a lot of banter between him and chat
[2022-12-10 17:09:48] <Ramymash> @nugiyen So.... his dwarfs live in a giant dick like house
[2022-12-10 17:09:50] <vulcanz132> can someone send his lootfilter pls
[2022-12-10 17:09:52] <BryanThePirate> He's "relatable" to a certain type of audience. Similar to how Quin is (not necessarily the same audience though).
[2022-12-10 17:09:54] <+LtSmokin> @nugiyen something I could see him doing is make a dwarf fortress where they only live in tree houses like elves
[2022-12-10 17:09:55] <Ginnie_> idk hes entertaining, messing with chat or getting taunted by them pepeLaugh
[2022-12-10 17:09:57] <ResurrectionByElection> well his rimworld streams was like watching paint dry LUL
[2022-12-10 17:10:02] <%+Pastor_J> Don't worry nugi, I watch you despite you playing games
[2022-12-10 17:10:07] <Ruuno> @nugiyen  you should lean on your strengths and enjoy the game your way

[2022-12-10 17:10:34] <wimpymeep> @ResurrectionByElection clearly he wasn't committing atrocities enough
[2022-12-10 17:10:51] <saucymcskipster> His rimworld streams are great LUL

[2022-12-10 17:11:03] <+LtSmokin> that's what reddit taught me
[2022-12-10 17:11:05] <TheLogicFan> You also have to mock the other people who likes them
[2022-12-10 17:11:06] <+nuubeeee> can somebody tell me how to equp your relics for the league mechanic?
[2022-12-10 17:11:07] <jabrodey> That's the point of this game YEPP

[2022-12-10 17:14:55] <TheLogicFan> you need critical mass
[2022-12-10 17:14:56] <Alpacka> hi chat, whats your take on the league mechanic
[2022-12-10 17:15:20] <@%Andrew756> nah fuck that
[2022-12-10 17:15:23] <@%Andrew756> too far
[2022-12-10 17:15:26] <BalderSideSwag> it multiplies everything YEP
[2022-12-10 17:15:26] <+josneig> no
[2022-12-10 17:15:26] <%PeterCarl> got it, i haven't been able to catch much of the stream so wasn't sure, thanks!
[2022-12-10 17:15:30] <heisenbergman> lol i heard that as "streamer conciousness"
[2022-12-10 17:15:31] <+josneig> its BASE chance I think
[2022-12-10 17:15:33] <@%Andrew756> it's basically +4
[2022-12-10 17:15:33] <kirin_ka> only the base chance
[2022-12-10 17:15:36] <+josneig> so only the 8%
[2022-12-10 17:15:40] <BalderSideSwag> its not only base pretty sure
[2022-12-10 17:15:42] <hardin360> Going for Stream would be foolish
[2022-12-10 17:16:12] <hardin360> Considering how many expedition scarabs you'll pick up just playing especially
[2022-12-10 17:16:21] <@%Andrew756> @BalderSideSwag literally says more base chance
[2022-12-10 17:16:24] <ADawgarian> put your foolish ambitions to rest
[2022-12-10 17:16:40] <BalderSideSwag> yes but the other nodes ad to base
[2022-12-10 17:16:45] <BalderSideSwag> @Andrew756
[2022-12-10 17:16:54] <HoleDonut> called me? 🍩 🍩 🍩 🍩 🍩
[2022-12-10 17:17:26] <+squidbonk> Guided metamorph scarabs are huge for metamorph
[2022-12-10 17:17:35] <Exelice> just use 3 fusing on 6s, on saw in ziz stream its working well
[2022-12-10 17:17:39] <@%Andrew756> @BalderSideSwag nah man base is base and anything you add is extra
[2022-12-10 17:17:40] <kirin_ka> try to 5 link with fusings and get a 6 link instead like i did it PEPW
[2022-12-10 17:18:32] <adros69> hey chat! whats the stat priority for this build? never tried it

[2022-12-10 19:34:35] <+70monocle> I played the league mechanic all day yesterday and my takeaway was that it was impressive how well telegraphed most of the monsters are and how skill based it really is. My only issues are that some of the afflictions are too run ending (mainly the no coins ones)
[2022-12-10 19:34:38] <Shihamut> @Nannniii wouldnt happen to be a unique would it?

[2022-12-10 20:14:31] <woqued> man i hate how common the curses and debuffs are on the league mechanic
[2022-12-10 20:15:04] <!%+Myth82> woqued just get inspiration every new room = EZ
[2022-12-10 20:15:15] <woqued> i just now got forced into either resolve loss on flask use or -40% ms. how is that fun
[2022-12-10 20:15:23] <%+Weero> also any rooms you can just run through, just run through them
[2022-12-10 20:15:32] <%+Weero> dont bother fighting the mobs, just run
[2022-12-10 20:16:09] <@%Andrew756> lol huck 5

[2022-12-10 20:17:08] <wanqiebs> how to put relic in sanctum dude
[2022-12-10 20:17:09] <wanqiebs> jajaj
[2022-12-10 20:17:10] <+sidviciouspro> new mysterbox just dropped @nugiyen
[2022-12-10 20:17:58] <+Headskull3> green heist contracts feel 50 times more rewarding than league mechanic
[2022-12-10 20:18:03] <!%+Myth82> Vosy1984 btw i also had this bug i couldnt leave the sanctum cuz my instance was gone
[2022-12-10 20:18:21] <Arklain> New mystery boxes look....ok
[2022-12-10 20:18:24] <+Headskull3> I have no idea, just get thing
[2022-12-10 20:18:37] <wanqiebs> dude i don to put relic on haha
[2022-12-10 20:19:02] <%Vosy1984> Myth82 this? https://imgur.com/a/wtdvRtV
[2022-12-10 20:19:10] <Sepulros> league mechanic is fun
[2022-12-10 20:19:10] <%+Weero> @wanqiebs before you start a sanctum run, you can change relics
[2022-12-10 20:19:15] <+Headskull3> wait, why would I continue league if I get a good relic, that is if its not rewarding
[2022-12-10 20:19:22] <%+Weero> @wanqiebs and I mean SANCTUM run, not new room
[2022-12-10 20:20:29] <wanqiebs> put on when start relic?
[2022-12-10 20:20:45] <wanqiebs> star sanctum?
[2022-12-10 20:21:03] <wanqiebs> got relic locker
[2022-12-10 20:21:04] <hassnainvj> poe ...its still fucked up ......the mobs still have teleportation buffs and ... RIP HH.
[2022-12-10 20:21:06] <+sidviciouspro> people do this for every mechanic, like i remember when people use to talk down on sentinel day 1. like bro chill
[2022-12-10 20:21:06] <+Headskull3> ok sure but think theoretically, if its not rewarding you would quit once you have a good charm
[2022-12-10 20:21:06] <Dragon1093> Excuse me it's already 20 min into date 2 i'm legally allowed to complain
[2022-12-10 20:21:07] <+ExpedientFalcon> Didn't it take like 2-3 weeks for people to figure out how to milk Ritual for mirrors?
[2022-12-10 20:21:18] <+Draftingle> maybe just do it for fun...i heard some people have that in games Kappa
[2022-12-10 20:21:28] <+dakkawoof> can't it be just like... fun? :D
[2022-12-10 20:21:29] <+Headskull3> but they always nerf old league mechanics
[2022-12-10 20:21:36] <marbletabletop> YAPPP gimme gimme
[2022-12-10 20:21:45] <%MrAscar> League is really fun even if it is not very rewarding (for now)
[2022-12-10 20:21:58] <@%+dadish> My only complaint is that the mechanic is half baked
[2022-12-10 20:21:59] <+Draftingle> not rewarding? KEKW
[2022-12-10 20:22:01] <+AunupB> for references, see original Harvest
[2022-12-10 20:22:05] <einhasad7> you know people lost their brains when they were asking for sentinel to go core (not only the recombinators, the mechanics too)
[2022-12-10 20:22:05] <@%+dadish> as i was worried about
[2022-12-10 20:22:07] <Bobbydomino> Guaranteed then people will complain old content isn't rewarding enough
[2022-12-10 20:22:10] <woqued> i wanted it to be fun so bad but for me so far, incredibly unfun. i like the rewards

[2022-12-10 20:22:42] <%PeterCarl> best league mechanic (imo) are those that are fun and interesting, rewarding is less important, but this one certainly is
[2022-12-10 20:22:57] <woqued> the debuffs youre forced into get really really obnoxious once you get deeper in
[2022-12-10 20:23:00] <+Headskull3> insane heist hasn't been balanced more
[2022-12-10 20:23:07] <+radiologue> even going 3-5 rooms deep on average (for me) atm.  i'll walk away with bubble gum currency that i really need right now

[2022-12-10 20:24:35] <Andrewpol12> very rewarding for melee especially
[2022-12-10 20:24:36] <+Headskull3> counter argument: was a streamer :P
[2022-12-10 20:24:39] <woqued> @Perkele_Itse you can be forced into bad choices

[2022-12-10 20:25:06] <katze8448> thats a general game balancing issue
[2022-12-10 20:25:12] <wanqiebs> ask melee to
[2022-12-10 20:25:14] <wanqiebs> haha

[2022-12-10 20:25:36] <BlueBanana3> i play ruthless melee. little bit sad. my record is room 5 :D didn't saw a boss yet
[2022-12-10 20:25:39] <woqued> @Perkele_Itse i disagree. this is more forced negatives than the oldschool roguelikes. its not a surprising bad monster or something. its just slow asphyxiation by purple text
[2022-12-10 20:25:45] <ResurrectionByElection> that's their identity tho no?
[2022-12-10 20:26:03] <einhasad7> this is literally what happened with the ruthless meta
[2022-12-10 20:26:08] <ResurrectionByElection> their identity is damage then right?
[2022-12-10 20:26:09] <jpxone> seismic has downtime KappaCool
[2022-12-10 20:26:12] <einhasad7> the best skills are the ones that have lingering damage

[2022-12-10 20:26:25] <MartyVanBuren> smaller AOE = easier to see degens, This is a buff.
[2022-12-10 20:26:28] <Tartaros38> identity is best skill .
[2022-12-10 20:26:44] <MaraudingBacon> @MartyVanBuren You Sir. I like you
[2022-12-10 20:26:48] <%MrAscar> Being too strong is their identity
[2022-12-10 20:27:46] <+AunupB> Chaos DoT also often requires Blight maintenance from the player
[2022-12-10 20:28:11] <+Headskull3> idk, I wouldn't wanna run around with seismic, maybe if it's poison prolif but not without that
[2022-12-10 20:28:12] <ResurrectionByElection> I agree with that, just not that removing aoe is the best approach

[2022-12-10 20:41:31] <reventor1337> ah okay, didnt check and seemed weird that you had VP instead of chance to poison. But I guess VP is alot better if your close to or above 100%

[2022-12-10 21:23:39] <%edubkn> does the curse buffs include marks as well?
[2022-12-10 21:23:46] <shadows_embrace_you> Heist can be played on a ZDPS build. All thats required is that you can stay alive and preferably run fast
[2022-12-10 21:24:19] <%PeterCarl> need to be able to protect people though
[2022-12-10 21:24:41] <ResurrectionByElection> unless you're seismic Kappa
[2022-12-10 21:24:53] <+Mantequillas> @xArclightx it's fairly complicated. I'd suggest Asmodeus' heist guide from a couple of leagues ago. It's on the youtubes.

[2022-12-10 21:25:02] <+Bearded__Wonder> good afternoon how goes the meta morphin hucky ranger?
[2022-12-10 21:25:41] <+sidviciouspro> its not bad in trade, cause rusted metamorph are cheap af. then run them in white maps but yea not the S tier money maker if people really want to rank metamoph
[2022-12-10 21:26:33] <GeeGeerip> Progress to respecing it?
[2022-12-10 21:26:36] <xArclightx> @xArclightx Oh okay thanks. Probably gonna stick with density then in form of harbingers, breach and shrines :D
[2022-12-10 21:28:42] <bumble1337> @nugiyen how's this league? 1-10
[2022-12-10 21:29:20] <+sidviciouspro> there is a glitch where you can't use exarch ichor, wtf
[2022-12-10 21:29:58] <bumble1337> a half out of 10 when taking all into account? That's horrible
[2022-12-10 21:30:04] <tsk_tsk_tsk> definitely better than most legues but like there's been so few good ones and this is deinitely the worst "good" one
[2022-12-10 21:30:23] <tsk_tsk_tsk> but good nonetheless
[2022-12-10 21:30:29] <bumble1337> makes sense
[2022-12-10 21:30:45] <+Headskull3> I'd rather do this mechanic than kalandra even if kalandra was more profit
[2022-12-10 21:30:59] <bumble1337> yea it looked interesting.. And it's the first i skip since syndicate so feels kinda wierd

[2022-12-10 22:56:46] <Anger_LBow> i am getting conflicting feedback about vaal venom gyre. Some say it is broken, other say it suck donkeyballs
