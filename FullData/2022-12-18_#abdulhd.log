[2022-12-18 23:28:41] <bozothedozo> You should try to roll on the second attack where you can't block it or parry it.
[2022-12-18 23:29:21] VIEWERS: 2¬†602
[2022-12-18 23:29:55] <jester1256hd> or try backing him in  a corner and just  keep attacking him
[2022-12-18 23:30:02] <bozothedozo> I'd try the axe
[2022-12-18 23:30:15] <+chintu02> @AbdulHD One thing you should try to do is use the light and heavy attacks on each weopon so that way you get more damage in
[2022-12-18 23:30:19] <@%+Mr_Madic_HD> Please do not take bowl hits or shots everytime Abdul HD dies, this is very unwise behavior, and has killed more then 400 members in the first 30 minutes of last of us, so follow this legend, and please no games attached to this gamers prowess in racing or video games in general
[2022-12-18 23:30:20] <%BeramHD> @bozothedozo tbh he should switch between them
[2022-12-18 23:30:31] <bozothedozo> And use abilities
[2022-12-18 23:31:07] <bozothedozo> while the ones for chaos blades are on cooldown to switch to axe and use it abilities and again
[2022-12-18 23:31:12] <bearbear1212> Now that World Cup out of the way @AbdulHD who you think gonna win the Champions league?
[2022-12-18 23:31:14] <+chintu02> yes!! like that

[2022-12-18 23:51:51] <@%^StreamElements> @Mr_Madic_HD The Pipe is called Midwakh, and it is used to smoke Dokha. Dokha is a tobacco product, it consists of finely dried and shredded tobacco along with herbs and spices. It also has different levels depending on the person's liking! Badr uses the Hot version which is the strongest.
