[2022-12-05 10:13:19] <+Corvus_The_Greedy> it's simple as that chiris4Cool
[2022-12-05 10:13:21] <KuroSamiVT> I was going to take psychic damage if you went the other way without finding the bonfire lol
[2022-12-05 10:13:23] <%rotarybubbles> were those dragons?
[2022-12-05 10:13:27] <luckyrandumize> asmr pouring
[2022-12-05 10:13:41] <Nanodan_> im sorry if this doesnt do anything but i think changing the screen resolution once and then back to how you prefer it might fix the auto target toggle
[2022-12-05 10:13:51] <Nanodan_> i had the exact same issue but i forget exactly what i tried that worked
[2022-12-05 10:13:58] <Pond_water> Once upon a time there was an undead who rolled off a cliff acccidentally and DIED. The end.
[2022-12-05 10:14:00] <%GREEDRA> gargoyles are technically dragons in dark souls tho

[2022-12-05 10:14:27] <KuroSamiVT> yeah fiddling with resolution settings mid-stream can be iffy
[2022-12-05 10:14:34] <%AlphaOmega82> greatsword with bleed?
[2022-12-05 10:14:50] <Pond_water> A flamberge.
[2022-12-05 10:14:58] <GravityAndBiscuits> It's not an ultragreatsword.
[2022-12-05 10:15:04] <+Collaterall> flamberge
[2022-12-05 10:15:07] <NaughtyWyvern> kinda like a flamberge
[2022-12-05 10:15:10] <GravityAndBiscuits> The Greatsword is an Ultra Greatsword.
[2022-12-05 10:15:20] <FakeKraid> flamberge, it's a legit historical weapon
[2022-12-05 10:15:26] <KuroSamiVT> Clauvio's sword size standards have been warped...
[2022-12-05 10:15:37] <%NaelLacertus> flame burger sounds tasty
[2022-12-05 10:15:41] <KuroSamiVT> Regular greatswords just aren't big enough for her...
[2022-12-05 10:15:45] <+Collaterall> flame grilled burgers, only at burger king

[2022-12-05 10:16:33] <galechronos> You'd hurt your hands pretty bad from the friction
[2022-12-05 10:16:34] <%Girutea> maybe w gloves ye
[2022-12-05 10:16:41] <GravityAndBiscuits> As long as the sides are smooth.
[2022-12-05 10:16:41] <+Flutts_> it seems like something not worth it if you loosen your grip too much you just fall off and die
[2022-12-05 10:16:42] <caltimoose> yeah your hands would have a bad time with that on most ladders
[2022-12-05 10:16:47] <GravityAndBiscuits> Don't forget, you're undead.
[2022-12-05 10:16:52] <caltimoose> gloves might get caught on some ladders too though

[2022-12-05 10:20:41] <GravityAndBiscuits> Again, it is 18 seconds long,. Which is like 15 seconds too long, imo.

[2022-12-05 10:25:13] <GravityAndBiscuits> I clipped you saying 'I want to explore, I want a bonfire'. Was debating cutting out the part with the dragons or whatever they were, but it was short.
[2022-12-05 10:25:26] <ozzyfanss> Ok great to hear onigiriBoomer
[2022-12-05 10:25:29] <KuroSamiVT> it lacerates
[2022-12-05 10:25:35] <GravityAndBiscuits> It's more convenient to have a clip that I can share with just a twitch link.

[2022-12-05 10:26:10] <%godot_was_here> it is abnormal

[2022-12-05 10:26:19] <%GREEDRA> it's fun clauviHeadpat
[2022-12-05 10:26:24] <GravityAndBiscuits> I don't see many people doing that. Some do it once a week but...
[2022-12-05 10:26:25] <Calavera_VT> It's paranormal
[2022-12-05 10:26:25] <%MrFoois> you watched blade runner right? what  did you think of it?
[2022-12-05 10:26:27] <%Paint2D> how could you spend time with us
[2022-12-05 10:26:30] <sartory__> Once or twice a week is pretty common
[2022-12-05 10:26:34] <GravityAndBiscuits> In any case, it's kind of neat.

[2022-12-05 10:27:53] <GravityAndBiscuits> My understanding is that two shields was a meta thing back in the day. Might still be, I don't know.

[2022-12-05 11:47:25] <galechronos> The lighting engine was much more advanced in the original builds, but it was too computationally expensive to keep
[2022-12-05 11:47:25] <DearLysse> I heard it was a scrapped mechanic, with darkness supposedly being a much more important part of the game than it is now

[2022-12-05 12:09:03] <FleaFlickr> as someone playing Persona 5 rn, yeah shorter games can be cool

[2022-12-05 13:05:17] <GravityAndBiscuits> Yeah. It's easy to fall into the numbers game if you know people who get affiliate in their second stream, and seem to put no time or love into any of it.

[2022-12-05 13:17:38] <%ClioAite> if people don't want raids, they can disable the raids
[2022-12-05 13:17:39] <+tragicjohnson84> Raid Obama
[2022-12-05 13:17:41] <Foldedmetal> Send my 2 person raid to tob explicitly for the purpose of lurkchecking
[2022-12-05 13:17:48] <GravityAndBiscuits> I try to raid other small people usually. People who I feel are under the radar or such.
[2022-12-05 13:18:02] <%manEmajor15> I overanalyze raids lol

[2022-12-05 13:18:22] <+Corvus_The_Greedy> Bigger streamers call smaller clout chasers to cripple their growth and therefore get rid of competition corvus70Smug
[2022-12-05 13:18:32] <%ClioAite> Twitter does fuck all for your actual streamer audience

[2022-12-05 13:18:59] <Foldedmetal> Twitter doesn't get you anything start a tumblr
[2022-12-05 13:19:05] <+Corvus_The_Greedy> Twitter have basically zero influence on your numbers on other platforms. Twitter users stay on twitter.
[2022-12-05 13:19:15] <RomeoEchoDelta> People are always gonna talk. Not all criticism is constructive.
[2022-12-05 13:19:20] <+AthenaGrindCore> For real. Twitter is twitter. People just live there
[2022-12-05 13:19:31] <GUY_KAZAMA> those 10000 people who liked my tweet are sure going to watch my stream Kappa
[2022-12-05 13:19:41] <%ClioAite> You see so many people with thousands of people of followers on Twitter and get single digit views on their streams, twitter audience generally doesn't follow you when it comes to streaming
[2022-12-05 13:19:45] <+Hacksaw_Fridge> TikTok is where the real money is
[2022-12-05 13:19:47] <%NaelLacertus> It's for communication!
[2022-12-05 13:19:51] <+Corvus_The_Greedy> Discord is far better for that
[2022-12-05 13:19:57] <+Corvus_The_Greedy> much better*
[2022-12-05 13:20:01] <%+FellyVT> Also finding the right circles helps you grow more.
[2022-12-05 13:20:08] <GravityAndBiscuits> I've used twitter, but don't really find much fun there.
[2022-12-05 13:20:31] <Foldedmetal> follow Utility Limb, and Deepleffen, those are the only accounts that matter
[2022-12-05 13:20:35] <+sasvulture> Sigrid and Bird blows my mind that they get an average 3-400 viewers and they only just hit 5k followers in twithc

[2022-12-05 13:20:58] <+Corvus_The_Greedy> I mostly follow artist on twitter to see their art

[2022-12-05 13:21:50] <+sasvulture> Yea 5k follows and 300 average viewers is when you are actually getting somewhere

[2022-12-05 13:22:18] <Foldedmetal> I have a celebration stream set for literally nothing I'm just going to gaslight my audience into thinking something happened
[2022-12-05 13:22:19] <Chenderle> Thanks for the stream!
[2022-12-05 13:22:24] <GravityAndBiscuits> I'll see how difficult it is to get to 200 after I get to 100. If growth is consistent it probably won't actually be that bad.
[2022-12-05 13:22:25] <%metakilt> Thanks for the stream!
