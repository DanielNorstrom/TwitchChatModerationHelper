[2022-12-07 17:55:35] <%Mizrahii> Are those walls made out of chalk
[2022-12-07 17:55:36] <dilron> When it's saves it's accounting for the that has past in the rest of the world that is also being simulated.
[2022-12-07 17:55:38] <%Lakart> You can change to drag selection in settings
[2022-12-07 17:57:26] <%Mizrahii> I mean, all reasonable

[2022-12-07 18:05:01] <%$RedScare> Hey you never know
[2022-12-07 18:05:35] <LordJaraxxxus> why do u dig so many layers down initially and build there?
[2022-12-07 18:05:35] <ThatLittleRedBird> and such each other's cocks
[2022-12-07 18:05:36] <%Lakart> I have the opposite of that list
[2022-12-07 18:05:40] <%Lakart> My list is the order we eat people in
[2022-12-07 18:05:41] <%$RedScare> What could possibly go wrong :)
[2022-12-07 18:05:50] <%Mizrahii> Sounds like you're just going there to provide yourself as food
[2022-12-07 18:05:51] <ThatLittleRedBird> suck* FailFish
[2022-12-07 18:06:01] <+EngineOfCreation> but you're the protagonist, you have plot armor!
[2022-12-07 18:06:17] <+vaulttecdirector> are people really thinking of emergency plans for "when shit hits the fan"
[2022-12-07 18:06:23] <+Rufish> Oh I love shows that put groups of people into End of the world type scenarios to see how they handle it
[2022-12-07 18:06:28] <+RitualSauce> being able to smooth the rough stone is VERY nice actually
[2022-12-07 18:06:48] <+bossdevildogg> Happy?!? What is happy?
[2022-12-07 18:07:11] <%Danphion> lol, mad max baby
[2022-12-07 18:07:26] <+ShimmyOn9> arm a militia
[2022-12-07 18:07:37] <+somerandomlurk> Kill my neighbors with it probably
[2022-12-07 18:07:40] <%Mizrahii> This is why we need RPGs. One of those badboys and those neighbours are toast
[2022-12-07 18:07:40] <the_Being> 50000 rounds, they've studied the statistics on actual hit rates
[2022-12-07 18:07:53] <%+AintEasyBeingCheesy> but what if there are 50k random guys trying to invade your home?
[2022-12-07 18:08:07] <%$RedScare> You need a well before you need 50,000 rounds
[2022-12-07 18:08:08] <the_Being> AintEasyBeingCheesy you're right, we need 5M rounds of ammo!
[2022-12-07 18:08:23] <+CodaPDX> Being on good terms with your neighbors and knowing how to cook is way more valuable than having an arsenal, TBH.
[2022-12-07 18:09:05] <brettinabox> absolutely. make friends not bullet holes
[2022-12-07 18:09:16] <+vaulttecdirector> too much movies
[2022-12-07 18:09:17] <+somerandomlurk> Feel like every dem president gun guys go crazy
[2022-12-07 18:09:25] <+Riverdusk> from watching movies
[2022-12-07 18:09:30] <%$RedScare> They watched Mad Max and thought it was a documentary
[2022-12-07 18:09:34] <@%+JimmyNintendo> It's a fantasy that they want to live out
[2022-12-07 18:09:36] <$Calmlittlebuddy> Television said so
[2022-12-07 18:09:46] <$Zeelilus> Surely my chances are better as a nomad than in known territory
[2022-12-07 18:09:58] <trashpandab3ar> I mean, making a basic plan for things going wrong makes sense. it's where you plan for every eventuality and stockpile everything is where things get weird
[2022-12-07 18:10:15] <swarley5455> what if you need floodlights and more guns
[2022-12-07 18:10:52] <+Luckyno__> what about landmines?
[2022-12-07 18:11:00] <%+Aretor> bout tree fiddy

[2022-12-07 18:11:04] <SuperSunSan> 1 bullet/day for 17 years
[2022-12-07 18:11:09] <+BlackShi> Maybe it is the investing in post apocalypse money.
[2022-12-07 18:11:13] <swarley5455> higly fucking illegal pre apocalypse
[2022-12-07 18:11:14] <@%+JimmyNintendo> Home Alone apocalypse
[2022-12-07 18:11:20] <brettinabox> all fun and games till the zombie apocalypse happens
[2022-12-07 18:11:27] <%Lakart> booby traps also highly illegal to have before the apocalypse
[2022-12-07 18:11:28] <+ed_v0n_schleck> wait when did they add graphics to dwarf fortress?
[2022-12-07 18:11:44] <+bossdevildogg> Claymores always the go to

[2022-12-07 18:12:10] <%+Aretor> i think they should really easy up on those laws. I pay my taxes, if i want to set up a log trap for AT-ST's thats my business
[2022-12-07 18:12:58] <+vaulttecdirector> start training with a katana
[2022-12-07 18:12:59] <$Zeelilus> Crossbows aren't loud and flashy though
[2022-12-07 18:12:59] <swarley5455> turtles like in tarky
[2022-12-07 18:13:21] <trashpandab3ar> bows are actually pretty easy to make

[2022-12-07 18:14:05] <+RitualSauce> the only time i support people getting heavily armed is if theyre involved in community defense and part of a group that is politically and socially in REAL danger
[2022-12-07 18:14:22] <MrCake42069> Giant ravens killed my whole pasture BibleThump this game hates animals
[2022-12-07 18:14:23] <@^Moobot> Buy things on Amazon and support your favorite Dick! n3f.tv/rhamazon
[2022-12-07 18:14:27] <%+ragde13eg> i love people that never close there doors and have guns all over the house
[2022-12-07 18:14:41] <$Zeelilus> Lots of people love those people ragde13eg LUL
[2022-12-07 18:14:43] <+ShimmyOn9> is it common to not lock your doors in the US?
[2022-12-07 18:15:11] <%+Netzer10> your 9mm under your blanket are enough :)
[2022-12-07 18:15:12] <@%+JimmyNintendo> But they want to shoot someone
[2022-12-07 18:15:12] <@%+JimmyNintendo> Most of the time
[2022-12-07 18:15:18] <Mousmn> rescGiggle
[2022-12-07 18:15:21] <+gravbike> shooting someone is a lot of trouble, even if you're in the right and its self defense
[2022-12-07 18:15:23] [Notification] DumpsterGravy subscribed at Tier 3. They've subscribed for 60 months! [that's some doors]
[2022-12-07 18:15:32] <Proxers> that looks like 48 doors to me
[2022-12-07 18:15:34] <$Zeelilus> You're primed and ready to break into the door market
[2022-12-07 18:15:36] <$unknownohyeah> apparently DF has sold 160,000 copies
[2022-12-07 18:15:39] <+bossdevildogg> Just poor defenseless dears
[2022-12-07 18:15:43] <%+AintEasyBeingCheesy> time to install 5 doors in every door frame
[2022-12-07 18:15:48] <%+AintEasyBeingCheesy> that way demons won't get in
[2022-12-07 18:15:49] <brettinabox> 48 doors down would be a good band name
[2022-12-07 18:15:59] <+Eclipsedhusky> Doorwf Fortress
[2022-12-07 18:16:02] <widsz> i think with 48 doors you are done for winter season
