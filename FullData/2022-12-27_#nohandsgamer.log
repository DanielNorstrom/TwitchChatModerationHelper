[2022-12-27 01:27:35] <6step> @NoHandsGamer are cards rotating out? if so, can we disenchant them for max dust?
[2022-12-27 01:27:53] <%+SoRefreshing> @6step not until the next expansion I'm pretty sure
[2022-12-27 01:28:12] <6step> @SoRefreshing ah ok, do they disenchant for max dust?
[2022-12-27 01:28:33] <Zaxlor> @6step The only time you get max dust is if you type "refund" into the search window. They don't "hall of fame" cards anymore. If something from the core set rotates out, you don't own it. You can recraft it for Wild though. You'lre basically just borrowing the core set

[2022-12-27 02:02:16] <Zaxlor> I've said it before and i'll say it again - Nerf ALL cards. Destroy them ALL - Then make only THREE cards: Damage. Heal and Counter. Now the game is finally balanced Kappa

[2022-12-27 02:34:56] <%+soccernerd22> hs is in one of its most solitare games ever with so many decks just trying to draw, cheat mana and burst with minimal interaction at all
[2022-12-27 02:35:21] <%matmarex> it's crazy how different the meta in your games is from my games, at 2k legend it's mostly thief rogue and i haven't seen a single one on streams today
[2022-12-27 02:35:32] <Zaxlor> Yeh, this meta feels like the biggest "How do I draw my outs?" meta so far Sadge

[2022-12-27 02:37:54] <%rexmkh> it seem like unholy needed its early game buffed
[2022-12-27 02:38:24] <%+SnowMyzer> I feel like they have to know what they’re getting into before releasing a groundbreaking card like renathal. Like you have to realize you can’t release something like that and then expect to backpedal
[2022-12-27 02:38:44] <+helix_sky> yeah i agree i like the archetypes in some of the classes and card design they implemented
[2022-12-27 02:38:50] <%matmarex> @SnowMyzer why not though? they totally did that in the past, like with odd/even enablers
[2022-12-27 02:39:13] <%+soccernerd22> they also did the panic meta sucks lets do 1 month with a diff xpac rotation to spice it up

[2022-12-27 02:40:02] <khuchten> Hate to put tinfoil hat on but those nerfs probably dictated by commercial interest, new cards need to be "relevant" every expansion

[2022-12-27 02:44:22] <%+The_monster_hunter> Yeah, needing to generate enough corpses to fill the board with minions and then use 5 more corpses for grave strength the next turn

[2022-12-27 03:03:18] <Zaxlor> @5ftHax The problem with that, is that the peasents get really sick putting the warheads into the trebs. Sometimes the rope sets on fire in the process too... It's kinda messy Kappa

Pain was so bad in 2018 and early 2019 I thought I was going to have to quit hearthstone. I'm able to type again in moderation which is a huge quality of life increase. Before on the stream I could only communicate with voice to text. Hoping to keep improving. Not looking to play high apm video games anytime soon though.
