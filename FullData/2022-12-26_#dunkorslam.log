[2022-12-26 03:58:31] <@^Nightbot> Noita Together, created by Soler, is a near-multiplayer mod that allows spells, wands, items and more to be shared between players. Sync hearts, orbs, shifts, gods and even death if you want. Help your team get to the boss and get the kill to lock in the win! Keep eyes open for updates and download the mod here: https://github.com/soler91/noita-together/releases/
