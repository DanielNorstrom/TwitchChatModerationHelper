[2022-12-10 13:17:38] <angeljackson0011> rearing all this birds üê¶ are important, case most of them are going out of existence
[2022-12-10 13:17:41] <crispazing> Your bird will probably need about two weeks to adjust to his new environment before you can begin taming him. Some birds will take longer, and some will need less time to acclimate. Place your bird‚Äôs cage in a busy room. Intuitively, a quiet room may seem ideal.

[2022-12-10 13:31:07] <%+tallpokidaddy> a hesitation in communication can stem from a fear of not wanting to screw up at times, but if someone loves you unconditionally you won't have to worry about being judged so yeh find someone that is not gonna put you down constantly where you can be accepted as yourself

[2022-12-10 16:39:52] <%+tallpokidaddy> heroin is not medicinal at all...it's lethal
[2022-12-10 16:39:54] <jkdstealth1> micro dose studies
[2022-12-10 16:39:57] <SuuPaVSlayZ> cannabis, cocaine and crack cocain are all fine but under the eye of the kae there is a strict product that can / can't be labeled and harder when sold in a street setting,
[2022-12-10 16:39:59] <jkdstealth1> like acid
[2022-12-10 16:40:01] <%Daniel_EU> @impeccablex blinkxHeyg
[2022-12-10 16:40:01] <@%heavymetalrules> heroin will make you forget everything OMEGALUL
[2022-12-10 16:40:02] <UncannyMan> but is that really true?  Lots of people are successful while using a variety of drugs, including prescription opiates, just certain people end up junkies
[2022-12-10 16:40:08] <%LincolnLee_tv> you wouldnt need crack or meth if you can get cocaine or opiods for cheaper cost
[2022-12-10 16:40:10] <iflywithwind4u> u sound better today looks like cold is gone

[2022-12-10 16:40:30] <$GrandTrizzy> I did shrooms only once never again waste if money
[2022-12-10 16:40:34] <tuankietcool> what is the bisexual?
[2022-12-10 16:40:36] <hfdrmmr_87> Hell yeah!!
[2022-12-10 16:40:38] <%+Cwarner312> psychedlics can lead to psychosis tho
[2022-12-10 16:40:38] <+HvyMetal62> I had to use Narcan many times due to heroin overdose.
[2022-12-10 16:40:39] <Gym5ocks> @GrandTrizzy same
[2022-12-10 16:40:40] <SuuPaVSlayZ> weed and crack are almost the same and the price of cocain is a strong hold of untrusted trust when asked and meeting dealers on the streets
[2022-12-10 16:40:43] <%LincolnLee_tv> and you can tax it as well
[2022-12-10 16:40:46] <%+Cwarner312> so there is potential ramifications
[2022-12-10 16:40:46] <%parrot43> hey liz and everyone!
[2022-12-10 16:40:48] <%AryazaBaleta> I‚Äôm sure heroin helps your anxiety in the short term LUL LUL
[2022-12-10 16:40:50] <$GrandTrizzy> $20 for a tiny chocolate and nothing
[2022-12-10 16:40:51] <%+tallpokidaddy> psilocybin is very healing because it activates new neural pathways in the brain; heals trauma and depression in many cases
[2022-12-10 16:40:56] <@%heavymetalrules> what IS the bisexual Hmm

[2022-12-10 16:41:24] <%LincolnLee_tv> Alcohol actually causes more deaths then heroine per year
[2022-12-10 16:41:26] <jimsabortion> It can just become a coping mechanism, a heap of people i know say that weed isnt addictive but i know a few people who have a HEAVY dependence on weed
[2022-12-10 16:41:39] <Gym5ocks> there are over 200 kinds of mushrooms that produce psilocybin. each with their own additional compounds that will effect how you are feeling
[2022-12-10 16:41:45] <+ElvisintorunuI> Have a good one, see ya later chat and @Blinkx_
[2022-12-10 16:41:46] <azder> @LincolnLee_tv I would bet it's because alcohol is legal and normalized though
[2022-12-10 16:41:48] <Gym5ocks> did we have this discussion a few days ago?
[2022-12-10 16:41:56] <%+Cwarner312> @lincolnlee_tv thats because alcohol is legalized and more readily available
[2022-12-10 16:41:57] <%LincolnLee_tv> I think portugal has done this and discovered addicition and crime went down
[2022-12-10 16:41:58] <+Misssster_Anderson> everything in moderation

[2022-12-10 16:42:10] <%+Cwarner312> hence why legalizing all drugs is a bad idea likely
[2022-12-10 16:42:11] <tuankietcool> I'm addicted nicotin
[2022-12-10 16:42:11] <Gym5ocks> Someone else was
[2022-12-10 16:42:26] <Gym5ocks> I ate a mushroom cap and just felt like i had poisoned myself it was awful
[2022-12-10 16:42:29] <azder> yeah I guess decriminalize I'm on board with, more than legalize
[2022-12-10 16:42:32] <$GrandTrizzy> @jimsabortion i feel that finding out my ex had a husband kinda messed me up
[2022-12-10 16:42:36] <SuuPaVSlayZ> coke is normally priced 10 / 20 / 40 / 60 / 80 / 100 and the demand being size (gram or half) or 10¬£ being 0.1 of pure 80/90% pure cocain
[2022-12-10 16:42:45] <%+slushys> When will they legalize me having all this ass!
[2022-12-10 16:42:47] <%+kenner621> didn't Denmark legalize everything,but it's heavily monitored
[2022-12-10 16:42:51] <Gym5ocks> no a psilocybin mushroom
[2022-12-10 16:42:55] <%LincolnLee_tv> i just think if you can regulate it you wouldnt have as many overdoses
[2022-12-10 16:42:56] <tuankietcool> I'm smoke cigarettes
[2022-12-10 16:42:57] <%+tallpokidaddy> i think being sober is ideal...but occassional mushrooms and cannabis for medicinal purposes is  legit..good for deep conversations that heal if with the right person

[2022-12-10 16:43:28] <+SwagSwagYT> Blink you single?
[2022-12-10 16:43:31] <jnetsuu> the legalisation of drugs would be to treat addicts as medical patients rather than criminals. The regulation of the drugs wouldnt be done as it wouldnt be a taxable product - it would just make it so that victims of drug abuse can get proper treatment

[2022-12-10 17:46:19] <@%$InfinityKitty51> I can always tell when someone's visiting the city vs living there. Tourists are quite dumb when it comes to doing this, standing in the street holding a fistful of cash, staring up at buildings aimlessly

[2022-12-10 20:27:09] <%+morts730> women's soccer is pretty good actually
[2022-12-10 20:27:16] <EVELDETH> England has a good women‚Äôs football team
[2022-12-10 20:27:26] <%+morts730> they dive a lot less than the men
[2022-12-10 20:27:31] <%+tallpokidaddy> women's soccer is more honest... they don't cheat or flop like men's imo
[2022-12-10 20:27:31] <EVELDETH> They won the EURO this year
[2022-12-10 20:27:47] <hva_er_jeg> I've heard women's soccer is much more difficult to referee since they don't outright fight but do more subtle and fucked shit than the men
[2022-12-10 20:27:53] <ggXTC> woman's football is never gonna grow or get big because one team is way too dominant to make it exciting
