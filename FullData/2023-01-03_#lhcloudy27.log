[2023-01-03 15:34:52] <+axo_zx> how is it possible to play rein on open maps like junker dorado do I just shield bot high ground?
[2023-01-03 15:35:05] <+axo_zx> do u have a junker town vod or something I can review
[2023-01-03 15:35:08] <%ian11232324> and top 10 is 5k?
[2023-01-03 15:35:14] <$Topsy__Cret> @axo_zx hug corners
[2023-01-03 15:35:34] <%Magicturtle12> ian11232324 top 500 is determined by SR, tie breakers are determined by ow1 account lvl
[2023-01-03 15:35:45] <+axo_zx> @topsy__cret thats possible on junker?
[2023-01-03 15:35:51] <%ian11232324> ok i get it sounds weird
[2023-01-03 15:36:07] <xPokesterx> rein mirror is respectable
[2023-01-03 15:36:07] <%ian11232324> thats going to be really weird for when the ow2 players reach top 10
[2023-01-03 15:36:08] <it_is_owen> hello mr streamer Okayeg
[2023-01-03 15:36:18] <%GIRLinMaleBody> is it owen
[2023-01-03 15:36:21] <$Topsy__Cret> @axo_zx it's more difficult, but whatever you do, dont play out in the open
[2023-01-03 15:36:23] VIEWERS: 94
[2023-01-03 15:36:28] <ZORO_559> That’s kind of stupid because what if you started playing in overwatch 2
[2023-01-03 15:36:36] <it_is_owen> @GIRLinMaleBody no i've lied to you
[2023-01-03 15:36:43] <%GIRLinMaleBody> @ZORO_559 then u cant get rank 1, ez
[2023-01-03 15:36:56] <+axo_zx> @topsy__cret what about just shield botting highground on first point does that provide more value than trying to play the corner?
[2023-01-03 15:37:06] <%ian11232324> RAGEY
[2023-01-03 15:37:34] <$Topsy__Cret> @axo_zx never shield bot, it breaks in 2 secs if enemies are human

[2023-01-03 15:38:42] <+axo_zx> @topsy__cret like that's my main issue, what if my team is playing highground I feel like it's stupid to just play a corner but like if I play highground I can only shield bot, so I guess my main question is it okay to be doing nothing as rein?
[2023-01-03 15:38:45] <ZORO_559> @girlinmalebody So you can literally be better than the rank 1 but you can’t be rank 1 because they were a higher level than you 9 months ago?

[2023-01-03 16:25:32] <%Magicturtle12> avon_blocksdale they should add decay then, if they dont want camping at rank 1
[2023-01-03 16:25:48] <avon_blocksdale> @Magicturtle12 I agree
[2023-01-03 16:25:52] <vay_ow> like ilimited sr ?
[2023-01-03 16:25:52] <smeiza> high gm 1 is literally like 5000 sr, at that point its just games played

[2023-01-03 16:26:19] <%+soldiermain31415> guys i figured out the 5k sr bug, its cuz they implmented momentum, which causes people to randomly have streaks which increased their SR more than the elo system would allow
[2023-01-03 16:26:26] <%+MorgothPlays> @smeiza maybe SR in OW2 can go OVER 9000
[2023-01-03 16:26:27] <vinnncenzo> idk why they would ever make the decision to remove decay from T500

[2023-01-03 16:27:09] <solaer_ow> there is no decay overall or just top500?

[2023-01-03 17:55:07] <vapee42069> My favorite character is the reaper guy. he is very powerfull. special move, honestly is one of the best in the game and so he comes equipped with these two revolvers and only takes about 3 or 4 shots to actually execute a kill so it comes really in handy specially when you come from the side.
