[2023-01-09 12:36:30] <$PoisonInTheMilk> is impossible burger healthier? i think it has almost same kcal
[2023-01-09 12:36:31] <+Money_Fish> yes I like eating vegetarian but for some reason the moment they try to fake meat it puts me off
[2023-01-09 12:36:35] <@%ArnarBjornss> I have had some nice non-meat patties that are sorta mix of things and not trying to like pretend to be meat patty. Relying on the beans and jalapeno etc for the taste etc.
[2023-01-09 12:36:36] <%ColaBubs> Has anyone tried the richmond plant based sausages?

[2023-01-09 12:37:09] <%$TheRealALGamer> tried lentils for the first time since i was a kid, still bad with texture but its really good ontop of garlic bread!

[2023-01-09 12:37:24] <lucy_frye> I really don't like the flavor of soy. I wish they would stop putting it in meat replacements.
[2023-01-09 12:37:30] <%terri344> as I've gotten older, the texture and the flavor is changing for me in meat?? not sure why??
[2023-01-09 12:37:50] <%$Forcastgraye> Does she not like the texture or is it that she care about the animals
