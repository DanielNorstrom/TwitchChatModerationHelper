[2022-12-09 14:51:32] <%hidingi> You should reheat a pizza on a pan, with a little water covered with a lid
[2022-12-09 14:51:32] <johnnysomeone> The trick is to turn the pizza upside down in the microwave

[2022-12-09 16:14:53] <westpanda> Do you think if they keep tuning easy and races faster that will open up more guilds to race? I think the gate holding back other guilds was the weeks required IE Heroic week farming for 10hrs+ a day but with all that gone and easier tuning will see more guilds who take 4-5 days to try compete @Naowh just my thoughts

[2022-12-09 17:38:57] <%Haste> buy RE -> rent it out -> cash flow positive -> house value increases -> take out loan on increased value -> buy more RE -> ??? profit
