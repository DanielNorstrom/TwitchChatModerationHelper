[2022-12-21 15:45:54] <@%^Nightbot> @morcock Poly- A prefix meaning many, as in polygon, a figure having many sides. In chemistry, it is used to form the names of polymers by being attached to the name of the base unit of which the polymer is made, as in polysaccharide. In Dota 2, Poly is someone who plays for more than one side in the game. BOGGED
