[2023-01-04 00:00:52] <%SteremyJeele> 2thy might've been the best in the world at the time
[2023-01-04 00:00:53] <+LaGrekk> You could still say the R word back then

[2023-01-04 00:01:05] <theoil345> @trey24k QuattroAce was super good
[2023-01-04 00:01:14] <+oppoxed> this was the fun tarkov times'
[2023-01-04 00:01:15] <%ciditi> maybe arena will change that Copium
[2023-01-04 00:01:15] <%+Deffy91> wasnt the skill gap because of experience back then and abusing desync
[2023-01-04 00:01:18] <%alexcarp33> desync
[2023-01-04 00:01:19] <%+treycerrounds> this was actually hardcore
[2023-01-04 00:01:19] <%SteremyJeele> There's so much chance involved.
[2023-01-04 00:01:21] <+BambisLover> Dylhero is best.

[2023-01-04 00:04:20] <its_just_june> It’s too bad they don’t release backdated versions and you can pick which version you want to play against others in. Makes no sense I know but you get it

[2023-01-04 00:05:55] <%elimud> bitcoin wipe was wild there would be 8 dead hatchet runners at interchange tech KEKW
[2023-01-04 00:05:56] <Abbstract> @fake_based shouldn’t this actually increase the skill gap? Since its harder

[2023-01-04 00:06:04] <!%c10v3rk1n6> No content last wipe. Sadge
[2023-01-04 00:06:09] <Abbstract> I dont get why streamers say the opposite
[2023-01-04 00:06:09] <delbertmendez> whats wrong with the recoil?
[2023-01-04 00:06:14] <XcentricKawa> I only played for 3 days last wipe, it just wastnt fun
[2023-01-04 00:06:14] <+dlamb44> this wipe is worse than last wipe
[2023-01-04 00:06:14] <+xDickey> arena should help @Trey24k
[2023-01-04 00:06:14] <%$WushuDeathKICK> @elimud the locker runners in interchange for bitcoincs
[2023-01-04 00:06:14] <pudgefreshmeat00> theyll add arena
[2023-01-04 00:06:18] <%hollowscore12> would you stop streaming tarkov?
[2023-01-04 00:06:19] <%YogurtEnema> they need to fix the game after drops
[2023-01-04 00:06:20] <%+The_Galpster> That wipe was my first and only wipe I’ve ever played and it was so much fun. Inertia ruined it for me because I loved running and gunning people lol
[2023-01-04 00:06:22] <%lolaustin> I think this is there make or break wipe imo
[2023-01-04 00:06:28] <w33knd_> @Abbstract alot of them suckin dicks thats why
[2023-01-04 00:06:30] <%$notEdvard> didnt they just spend the whole of last wipe working on streets and arena?
[2023-01-04 00:06:30] <%LeShades> @lamora13th he needs the skull crusher axe for the trade and that requires a marked key to get
[2023-01-04 00:06:33] <%prom3e> dec 2020 was btc wipe
[2023-01-04 00:06:35] <+Vovivosp> is better to ja
[2023-01-04 00:06:37] <ZeroTOwO> usually map wipes are longer
[2023-01-04 00:06:37] <MrFlubss> It's definitely a make or break type of situation now for bsg with how bad last wipe was
[2023-01-04 00:06:39] <%$notEdvard> prob more time to add shit now
[2023-01-04 00:06:39] <%+The_Galpster> Now I just watch the game and don’t play
[2023-01-04 00:06:41] <+ZachPlaysGamesToo> @elimud yes and you could still put mags in containers and such
[2023-01-04 00:06:43] <notsilverjason> should make plans to branch out just in case at least 1 different game
[2023-01-04 00:06:43] <fake_based> @Abbstract no its nearly impossible to outplay positioning now. its also harder in a way you cant play around cause random recoil patterns
[2023-01-04 00:06:45] <%therealslizzyszn> you say that but i lliterally can't get into a raid in under 15 minutes. did they delete 90% of the servers they used to use or is the player base higher than ever? I had zero issue matching last wipe
[2023-01-04 00:06:47] <%+OnThat4GLTE> inertia is ass
[2023-01-04 00:06:47] <delbertmendez> whats wrong with the recoil?
[2023-01-04 00:06:47] <%+SaltyBoiSean> I skipped the entire of last wipe. Optics change would have been good if it didn’t make half the optics un usable. Inertia would be fine if it was implemented better. Sadge.
[2023-01-04 00:06:50] <XcentricKawa> what are the current issues with recoil? I haven't played in about a year
[2023-01-04 00:06:54] <chzapex> my pmc is supposed to be an ex soldier and his noodle arms cant handle a tiny m4

[2023-01-04 00:07:04] <ipenetrateu> yeah ive no lifed this game since i started playing but the last two wipes ive quit about 3 months into wipe it gets so dry
[2023-01-04 00:07:07] <%prom3e> dec 2020 was btc wipe @Trey24k
[2023-01-04 00:07:07] <%Sutingurei> I think the side to side inertia is dog shit
[2023-01-04 00:07:08] <$bubble_d> @Abbstract There used to be less "RP" aspects, now you get into a heated fight and you can ricochet, jam, fragment, plus with inertia it takes a lot more of the mechanical skill away and moves it to outside factors
[2023-01-04 00:07:11] <!%ethan8855> It’s probably only make or break if some legit competition shows up though
[2023-01-04 00:07:14] <%Sutingurei> like you cant side step
[2023-01-04 00:07:14] <w33knd_> The real EFT content creators are rank 60+ and not the casual cunts :D

[2023-01-04 00:07:26] <%+dobe48> The thing that sucks for the casual player is the early game progression hasnt changed. So it doesn't feel like a different game and streets is too low frames
[2023-01-04 00:07:30] <cereal_enjoyer> i played 7 wipes, gave up last wipe cuz i was so bored and only came back because of streets. if this wipe isnt good thats it for me

[2023-01-04 00:08:15] <Mistiquin> i stopped for sure, but i might come back this wipe if the cheater situation dies down
[2023-01-04 00:08:15] <buuuuuunk> It was deader than starcraft 2
[2023-01-04 00:08:16] <%Sutingurei> i hate what they did with red dot sights. the reticle is the size of the whole sight
[2023-01-04 00:08:18] <%+tyladatyga> this wipe has been tough for me to play, and i can't really figure out why.
[2023-01-04 00:08:21] <%+Governmentmu1e> The lowest I saw was 2200
[2023-01-04 00:08:22] <+TH4T_GUY89> it's a game I will always come back to, I love it and hate it

[2023-01-04 00:08:30] <%bzph> this is my first full wipe playing, i learned a lot starting last wipe with like 2 months left but i can see the issues already, i just have the high of playing a new game rn
[2023-01-04 00:08:32] <%+dobe48> The thing that sucks for the casual player is the early game progression hasnt changed. So it doesn't feel like a different game and streets is too low frames

[2023-01-04 00:08:41] <+majinbuu0> take away drops and you lose 60% of those viewers lol
[2023-01-04 00:08:41] <%remedy52> even with landmark?
[2023-01-04 00:08:41] <+xV4P1Dx> Maybe they shorten the wipe cycle if that happens? They would just have to hire more devs to increase the patch times
[2023-01-04 00:08:44] <+draeyf> g36 or aug a1
[2023-01-04 00:08:45] <Chansizzle9> Last wipe I stopped early on. this wipe I'm already just kinda not feelin it. Not feelin the gunplay anymore
[2023-01-04 00:08:48] <%UltraUnlimited21> if dmz pops of and actually turns out to be decent and bsg doesnt update it will be a killer
[2023-01-04 00:08:49] <buuuuuunk> @Purkk been in beta as long as star citizen it feels
[2023-01-04 00:08:49] <%+OnThat4GLTE> ya majority of my friends have quit now i try to fight 2 man and 3 man squads and always die im about done with this wipe already to ive been getting owned
[2023-01-04 00:08:50] <+wardaddybon> i stopped playing last wipe. never gonna touch the game again
[2023-01-04 00:08:59] <+RoundTableGamingTV> I think that Arena will go along way towards making a longer wipe cycle tolerable
[2023-01-04 00:09:00] <Mistiquin> my duo and I ran into like 3 cheaters in the span of a week and it just killed the wipe

[2023-01-04 00:09:03] <%StinkyBabyStink> I always do one wipe on one wipe off, I only played to level 10 last wipe so I'm going hard this wipe
[2023-01-04 00:09:04] <%$mediocre_pwnage> @Trey24k tarkov should add a prestige mode where you reset but get some extra stats and you can relevel with a purpose
[2023-01-04 00:09:06] <%+justinsert420> It's 367k viewers rn but that is with drops
[2023-01-04 00:09:06] <%PooSmusher> i havent played tarbob in 2 wipes

[2023-01-04 00:09:09] <%origin503> Nikita has said in the past that they basically dont care about the casual eft gamers. If they dont make it more casual friendly or come out with arena soon, it could definitely die down to an unplayable point.

[2023-01-04 00:09:32] <kluedox> i feel like the sound is a big problem, nikita even did this tweet long time ago when he asked wwhat they should work on, and they worked on sound but they fucked it up big
[2023-01-04 00:09:33] <spunss> stopped 2 wipes ago from cheats and just boredom honestly
[2023-01-04 00:09:39] <Mistiquin> its fun to watch but the grind doesnt seem worth it when you see people flying and shit
[2023-01-04 00:09:43] <crust____> Or, hear me out, they wipe the game every 3 months or 4 then??????????
[2023-01-04 00:09:46] <godlike4ever> I DO NOT SHARE YOUR OPINION... I PLAY TARKOV FOR A COUPLE OF MONTHS AFTER WHIPE THAN THAT IS IT... I do play other games like DOta, iRacing, Football Menager ETC

[2023-01-04 00:10:06] <%ImLasha> is vector gunsmith fixed?
[2023-01-04 00:10:07] <+UncleEarll> I think tarkov will succeed it might have to cut down on the hardcore grind to broaden the appeal to everyone. I think after arena comes out it’ll be pretty good.
[2023-01-04 00:10:10] <%Helgyyy> TriHard more aks first
[2023-01-04 00:10:11] <%^b3njamino> have a fixed tarkov, or have renegade raider @Trey24k

[2023-01-04 00:12:05] <Mistiquin> and the funny part is thats a quick change to make, they just arent making those small changes that would make the game feel so much better

[2023-01-04 00:12:48] <%+Maver1ck3dge> 9mm smgs should not have more recoil than an M4 has IRL (which is also nothing)
[2023-01-04 00:12:49] <%Helgyyy> if they do that audio will somehow get worse lmao
[2023-01-04 00:12:50] <+ApolloSight> watched my teamate shoot a dude  3 times, no armor and dude just kept running. tarkov is so inconsistent

[2023-01-04 00:13:16] <gods_of_honor> yes
[2023-01-04 00:13:16] <Mistiquin> its whoever sees the other guy first
[2023-01-04 00:13:22] <+danielsan412> pretty much why I never started playing lmaoo

[2023-01-04 00:13:22] <Rufioo> Late wipe is boring as fuck. Insta death in every fight. Either I 1 tap someone or they 1 tap me. PVP is not fun
[2023-01-04 00:13:22] <%+henrybcool5> i feel like i never actually fight people
[2023-01-04 00:13:23] <Sarclee> finally found 2nd flash drive bro holy

[2023-01-04 00:13:29] <%Scooby890_> lvl 21
[2023-01-04 00:13:30] <%+Hugzeiiii> exactly what you said, youre dead beforee the fight even starts
[2023-01-04 00:13:31] <+WNTRfps> if the highest pen round was 7.62 PS i would be happy @Trey24k
[2023-01-04 00:13:35] <%+Maver1ck3dge> part of it. Also every single raid, Mutant and RD with BP on EVERY SINGLE pmc
[2023-01-04 00:13:35] <%LeShades> Is podcast with Nikita ever going to happen anymore or did that fall through?
[2023-01-04 00:13:37] <%Helgyyy> let nikita cook
[2023-01-04 00:13:37] <+charaaah> m4 has double than mutant for some reason

[2023-01-04 00:13:38] <polanspring> I miss old double armor fights when everyone was a sponge LUL
[2023-01-04 00:13:41] <%Scooby890_> and how do i check the cooldown?
[2023-01-04 00:13:41] <brushnit1> Going to shorline to go to the same POI's over and over kills it for me
[2023-01-04 00:13:42] <+ApolloSight> isnt that kinda what this game is?
[2023-01-04 00:13:44] <godlike4ever> This is my 4th year of Tarkov... You cant play just one game all the time
[2023-01-04 00:13:45] <%prom3e> boring but yet realistic
[2023-01-04 00:13:47] <+Twis26> bp m62 r broing and the recoil like u said doesnt make sense
[2023-01-04 00:13:53] <%Locz> where you actually have time to heal
[2023-01-04 00:13:55] <prettybadgame_> ya
[2023-01-04 00:13:55] <pepperjackmac> I love that too
[2023-01-04 00:14:00] <%+SaltyBoiSean> There’s just no variety late wipe idc about ammo balancing honestly
[2023-01-04 00:14:01] <+LaGrekk> if they didn't run the audio it'd be fun
[2023-01-04 00:14:06] <%blxcklock> Ammo just doesn’t feel rare
[2023-01-04 00:14:09] <Dan_of_Earth> idk, this wipe in particular has not felt very fun.  every fight has felt like a coin flip where i get face tapped instantly
[2023-01-04 00:14:10] <gods_of_honor> it seems like everyone is on an even playing field which is the fun part
[2023-01-04 00:14:11] <w33knd_> No sense discussin about this game ffs
[2023-01-04 00:14:16] <%dusttodust6661> Just remove all AP ammo and problem solved lol
[2023-01-04 00:14:16] <Samixx22> very balanced 4Head
[2023-01-04 00:14:22] <+RoundTableGamingTV> Yea pistol calibers need an overhaul. They have recoil that is way too high for the load
[2023-01-04 00:14:32] <%+JohnnyJamrock> Even now. I feel the lps with the mosin I’m getting shot on with
[2023-01-04 00:14:37] <+Obnoxiouscombo8> i feel like ai scavs are too good, they should nerf them if they expect new players to come to the game and to stay playing
[2023-01-04 00:14:39] <%+JohnnyJamrock> Shit on

[2023-01-04 00:14:47] <Zeno_Here> 2 rd burst on g36 is hilarious. Have you seen it?
[2023-01-04 00:14:48] <Samixx22> hey trey btw have you played alot of streets ?
[2023-01-04 00:14:50] <Turkeytoe1597> step 1: remove flea market. step 2: make higher tier ammo available for BARTER only. step 3: transition to seemless map progression, which in theory, should slow down the game
[2023-01-04 00:14:52] <Zhinloki> idk why 7.62x39 and 7.62x51 arent as limited as 54r or even more so kind of dumb that I can just buy the best ammo because ive played a lot
[2023-01-04 00:14:53] <Henzoolive> @Trey24k what gun are you  playing?
[2023-01-04 00:14:55] <%Scooby890_> @buuuuuunk  how do i check the flea cooldown?
[2023-01-04 00:14:57] <Mistiquin> make the cheaper ammo more viable, make the best ammo harder to get

[2023-01-04 00:15:51] <+Twis26> im ususally 2 maybe 3 months wipe then i dont play rest wipe cuz at that point its late wipe and its just sleeper bp m62

[2023-01-04 00:15:58] <!%ethan8855> It’s like they started doing that with 855 and PS not at lowest trader levels but then they didn’t actually move the OP ammos or take them off the flea
[2023-01-04 00:16:01] <%glockazn> kinda makes sense from an RPG standpoint. Person who grinds and levels up has the best gear.
[2023-01-04 00:16:04] <%mochasoda> it really should be m80 is pretty good
[2023-01-04 00:16:07] <tilo_schwarzbach> hyperrat hat like 13k bp last wipe really early, fucking crazy
[2023-01-04 00:16:08] <Charlie_Nuts> i wouldnt get 1 tapped as often KEKW

[2023-01-04 00:16:14] <%+kaleb325> i think i found 60 rounds of 7n40 ever
[2023-01-04 00:16:15] <Mistiquin> yeah the chads would be running m80
[2023-01-04 00:16:18] <Singlewithhemroids> bp and m62 needs to be as rare as 7n40
[2023-01-04 00:16:18] <%+clown4l> are you still poor

[2023-01-04 00:16:30] <prettybadgame_> ya they need to make all the meta ammo FIR only
[2023-01-04 00:16:31] <+ApolloSight> imagine being so good u gotta tell them to take things away. Chad
[2023-01-04 00:16:31] <%bzph> this game is still a shooter despite it being an RPG
[2023-01-04 00:16:32] <pepperjackmac> At least high pen bullets
[2023-01-04 00:16:32] <+xWVNDERERx> You’re about to delete stash huh… 👀
[2023-01-04 00:16:33] <pepperjackmac> Yes
[2023-01-04 00:16:35] <+walker0500> ayo that spot goes crazy
[2023-01-04 00:16:38] <%blxcklock> It would definitely add more longevity to the wipes, ammo being special & not just meta kits every where
[2023-01-04 00:16:38] <%+justinsert420> Would make it way cooler to use that ammo too, makes it more scary to lose it
[2023-01-04 00:16:38] <notsilverjason> you saw someone
[2023-01-04 00:16:39] <Mistiquin> yeah but if you play a shit ton and shoot a shit ton you should run out of the best ammo and be scrapping
[2023-01-04 00:16:40] <Zeno_Here> They only need to fix the lighting, audio, recoil, and balancing. lol
[2023-01-04 00:16:41] <+damnreap> he passed to the left when u looked down btw
[2023-01-04 00:16:41] <Singlewithhemroids> exactly
[2023-01-04 00:16:46] <%+Governmentmu1e> is that 7n40 ammo any good? I actually found some
[2023-01-04 00:16:46] <buuuuuunk> Is the good ammo still locked behind max traders?
[2023-01-04 00:16:46] <DimebagTV> Can someone tell me what's on his head?
[2023-01-04 00:16:50] <Henzoolive> what quest are you doing?
[2023-01-04 00:16:51] <VicktorVonDoom> @Trey24k what do you think would happen if all that ~month 2 ammo was taken out of the game or found in raid only and small quantities, no guaranteed source at all
[2023-01-04 00:16:51] <Samixx22> have you played streets alot ?
[2023-01-04 00:16:51] <DimebagTV> I just got here
[2023-01-04 00:16:53] <%LeShades> I wonder if some streamers would abuse it like tigz with 7n40 last wipe. Love tigz but he would have viewers bring 7n40 into raid for him
[2023-01-04 00:16:58] <+enterPOOL> They balance the other versions of ak. Not being able to buy bt
[2023-01-04 00:16:59] <KGooly> @auxhatesyou 7n40 is best 5.45 pen
[2023-01-04 00:17:02] <+RoundTableGamingTV> In general the ballistic pen on ammo in this game is highly unrealistic, even understanding that armor ratings are based on Russian measurements. The pen values of 5.56 for example is ABYSMAL compared to what it should be
[2023-01-04 00:17:03] <FunnymaenDipaleo> @AuxHatesYou just ultra rare ammo for ak-74
[2023-01-04 00:17:04] <allb3ast> klean was talking about this the other day saying those best rds should be FIR only and or craftable only

[2023-01-04 00:17:15] <%+CaptainFreezey> I guess it's more enjoyable for someone like me who isn't very good at PvP becausee there is an incentive for me to play, and actually get better... where as the people who are already good get bored of it being too easy :)
[2023-01-04 00:17:16] <%$Qvantum_Purple> good players and streamers in general will have ammo anyways..they just farm rogues or shit like that
[2023-01-04 00:17:20] <%+Deffy91> ive found 15 rounds of 7n40 in the last 2 wipes

[2023-01-04 00:17:38] <%cleeterrr> thats why i main mosin late wipe. more fun

[2023-01-04 00:21:10] <%therealslizzyszn> heres the problem: half the people in this chat if not more can't get into more than 2 raids an hour even if they insta-die because the matching is so bad. So we're gonna be level 12 facing level 40+ in 30% of our fights by the time we can actually grind the game. All BSG does is rep or quest lock the good shit making the game even more lopsided for the average player. You love early wipe fights but you're 5 days in using the best gear in the game already.
[2023-01-04 00:21:13] <+RoundTableGamingTV> The difference in load is not going to effect damage to your body overall NEARLY as drastically as the game makes it out
[2023-01-04 00:21:13] <tilo_schwarzbach> and it give +10 recoil instat of +5 with bp

[2023-01-04 00:35:06] <magic_marven> in tarkov we start out beginning of wipe malnourished and radioactive af, that's why bad recoil
[2023-01-04 00:35:07] <@%^Boos> i will BAN b3n for his ideas
[2023-01-04 00:35:07] <%SteremyJeele> I want the old recoil back, and just nerf damage values overall to counteract it. More rounds to put the target down, but easier to stay on-target. That would also make it so more people are running viable mid-tier ammo.

[2023-01-04 01:07:04] <ETGShado> a lot of IEMs are in like a semi custom shape that fits a lot of ears. but custom is top tier
[2023-01-04 01:07:04] <%+mcgridski> @Zumwar no
[2023-01-04 01:07:13] <+BenJammin_lol> @bourbon_l not specifically in tarkov but iems are totally different experience to traditional over ear headphones

[2023-01-04 01:07:39] <ETGShado> it's passive noise cnaceling
[2023-01-04 01:07:40] <Chansizzle9> @Zumwar The better fit also blocks out some more noise
[2023-01-04 01:07:41] <ETGShado> not active
[2023-01-04 01:07:43] <+BenJammin_lol> yeah no active noise cancelling but they fit well so they do block a lot of noise
[2023-01-04 01:07:44] <island_boy_420> @Donxvxn_ even the cheapest ones
[2023-01-04 01:07:50] <ETGShado> passive is just blocking your ear
[2023-01-04 01:07:58] <%Zumwar> gotcha gotcha
[2023-01-04 01:07:59] <+g0mium> I wonder if the difference is noticeable. I barely noticed shit from average headphones to decent ones plugged to a DAC
[2023-01-04 01:08:17] <+g0mium> it's better but not crazy good
[2023-01-04 01:08:17] <%Zumwar> 10/10 ear canal protection
[2023-01-04 01:08:18] <Mistiquin> depends if you have an ear for that kinda thing
[2023-01-04 01:08:23] <ETGShado> Moondrop arias are a good way to see if you like IEMs. they are $80 and sound pretty good to most people's preffered tuning

[2023-01-04 01:08:45] <+BenJammin_lol> @g0mium obviously its hard to quantify you just have to experience things for a while then go back to really get the difference
[2023-01-04 01:08:49] <%RetrosPlace> He’s broke @zhentekk
[2023-01-04 01:08:53] <%+mcgridski> @ZhenTekk weight probably

[2023-01-04 03:48:38] <luminarysolar> While the mild muscle pain seems to be temporary, players have pointed out that the severe muscle pain debuff does not have a timer. One Redditor wrote, “I've had Severe Muscle Pain for a whole day and a half now, there's no timer or any indicator on how long it's going to last for. The Weak Muscle Pain had a (less than a day) sign under it, but Severe is totally lacking that. Not sure if it's a bug or something.”

[2023-01-04 05:43:40] <@%^StreamElements> the stupidest thing about it is if they really wanted to ban cheaters it would be easy all they gotta look for is codes that have been changed if u know coding u understand what i mean its not hard to find out when someone changes the codes the only reason they don’t is cuz the money the cheaters bring its facts technically they could make a dummy server and anyone with changed codes aka cheaters could be singled out and always sent to a dummy server

[2023-01-04 08:58:16] <FeatherPrince> why's it called binaural if they are using surround? @Holl0wg
[2023-01-04 08:58:22] <%+dylan220> yea cause the sound doesnt surround you enough currently
[2023-01-04 08:58:31] <$SamFerrariTTV> Those the same postfx you running or did you change them?
[2023-01-04 08:58:44] <itsBlvrry> Damn
[2023-01-04 08:59:02] <Holl0wg> If your windows uses 7.1, also games in bin get the effect of distance and surround, it's not perfect but better than just using stereo
[2023-01-04 08:59:10] <CosmicRequiemNA> I actually like the audio with binaural  but it makes the game trash to play

[2023-01-04 09:01:28] VIEWERS: 1 761
[2023-01-04 09:01:32] <FeatherPrince> the game has to support 5.1 or 7.1, if it's purely stereo it might mess with some stuff
[2023-01-04 09:02:15] <FeatherPrince> and tarkov did not support 7.1 previously, so why would they make such a massive change without telling anyone
[2023-01-04 09:02:52] <itsBlvrry> Youre right and while tarkov doesnt support it you can remix it with your audio drivers. Atleast thats what ive seen looking it up
[2023-01-04 09:03:28] VIEWERS: 1 761
[2023-01-04 09:03:33] <Holl0wg> you can use THX aswell, competative mode for tarkov is out, which remixes up things for you

[2023-01-04 09:04:49] <bigcujo710> @featherprince what did they change about 7.1 ?
[2023-01-04 09:05:00] <itsBlvrry> I mean yah of course it was bad. You either remix it with a third party program or through your audio drivers

[2023-01-04 14:30:06] <ThatLuckyBoy> I wish battlestate would focus an entire wipe to make the game run better on most systems. It's ridiculous that with a 3080 and a good cpu you barely get 100 fps on most maps. It would add so much to the enjoyment of the game and gunfights if everyone could get over 144 fps on most systems

[2023-01-04 15:51:25] <%RolledByRobbe> it happens to so many games tho
[2023-01-04 15:51:25] <thegodlywindz> Am I the only one who likes the sound with binaural on ?

[2023-01-04 15:51:33] <@%stopdodgin> this is the worst audio ive heard since 2019 lol

[2023-01-04 15:51:54] <+KETOS_1337> "beta" more like early access
[2023-01-04 15:51:55] <+dylanz1369> Maybe they altered sounds to present a challenge to the sweats

[2023-01-04 15:51:56] <+jaco96> @dbarss Yeah temperatures look fine... I just hate having a good gpu and not enjoy the game because of the bad optimization... I guess I have to upgrade at least cpu and moboù
[2023-01-04 15:51:56] <diccweedjoe> “Its still in beta”
[2023-01-04 15:51:56] <%$WushuDeathKICK> between the audio and the lighting, interchange is by far the worst map

[2023-01-04 15:52:01] <+joecrabs> i think they knew the sound was shit but they can work with this sound the last sound there was nothing they could do to fix it

[2023-01-04 16:05:23] <colintheog> if the door is open and they see something "suspicious" that's reasonable cause
[2023-01-04 16:05:25] <%$WushuDeathKICK> his house smelled too good, thats probable cause
[2023-01-04 16:05:26] <%+House_of_Cows> The best way to keep cops out of your house without a search warrant is to close the door behind you and talk to them outside
[2023-01-04 16:05:26] <freshflameee> thats not permission.

[2023-01-04 16:05:40] <+doctortripleog> thats why you always walk outside and shut your door when you talk to the police

[2023-01-04 16:53:39] <Rhetterz_> could the cop have said the syringe he saw was probable cause

[2023-01-04 16:54:02] <+Vix_99> during the show?

[2023-01-04 17:10:10] <%$Dale_B0203> is about 130 feet...  there is next to no velocity drop off at 130 feet
[2023-01-04 17:10:10] <%$lt_carl_winslow> velocity itself doesn't affect damage, higher velocity will increase fragmentation depending on the round and increase expansion

[2023-01-04 17:14:15] <Fatchi7> scavs can laser u like we used to with the old hk, they dont have recoil or whiffs ever

[2023-01-04 17:19:56] <%Bryanexmachina> I'd rather they fix the audio than balance the guns
[2023-01-04 17:19:58] <%SteremyJeele> It took like 5 years to get streets. So we can expect balancing never.

[2023-01-04 17:20:23] <Thunderrxr> can you still buy 7.62 BP from traders this wipe @Trey24k
[2023-01-04 17:20:25] <+ConMcBon> what happened this update that i went from medium graphics 90 fps to everything low running 20
[2023-01-04 17:20:25] <%jaboo224> just add the pkm and let's go

[2023-01-04 17:20:27] <%prontotov> they should do a whole wipe no traders

[2023-01-04 17:20:27] <+ClasterOG> yeah the 7.62 aks need a phat nerf
[2023-01-04 17:20:27] <+moonlander34> improve ammo barters and remove a lot of purchase options
[2023-01-04 17:20:29] <%ItsSimonDS> not balancing because you have more content you want to add *sometime in the future* is just bad game development

[2023-01-04 17:20:32] <%+gfystarrs> Balancing is just tuning numbers as opposed to creating models and animations

[2023-01-04 17:20:33] <+MHI_R34Pr> itd be nice if they just mix it up a little so the weapons are loosely based on real life and they tune them each wipe so meta weapons change keeping everyone from running the same build
[2023-01-04 17:20:33] <@%^derks> peepoRiot we want sub 2000
[2023-01-04 17:20:34] <%alexcarp33> instead of adding the ability to buy more ammo they should just add more Glock animations
[2023-01-04 17:20:35] <boxofrockets> They need to work on making some of the attachments usable
[2023-01-04 17:20:39] <+jonnyboiyoi> I love sniping in this game but all the rifles on full auto feel so annoying past 15 meters
[2023-01-04 17:20:39] <@%^derks> peepoRiot add more keltec

[2023-01-04 17:21:00] <twitchismadeofpaper> balancing would probably not add new bugs to the game, and they love adding bugs..

[2023-01-04 17:22:17] <ScamTrax> they should buff base weapons and hard nerf all attachments

[2023-01-04 17:22:29] <@%^derks> @hela52 yes
[2023-01-04 17:22:30] <%Streeb0> Thats because the devs dont play the game they create. Theres no way this new audio got tested and they thought it was good
[2023-01-04 17:22:30] <+jonnyboiyoi> they should not be adding things for the sake of adding it. they need to make it worth something or unique in some way
[2023-01-04 17:22:31] <%RareFor_MrYan> i limit myself to literally 2 grips, one for stats one for looks
[2023-01-04 17:22:31] <%+AGNsnipez> imagine not balancing the actual fundamentals of this video game - the guns - cos its a waste of time. haha

[2023-01-04 17:22:55] <%ciditi> would be nice to be able to choose what attachments you want to use to alleviate different problems. Like maybe an attachment lowers recoil a lot, but makes the ergo take a hit, or the opposite, etc, stuff like that would at least add some variety
[2023-01-04 17:22:56] <iixASTRO> @trey24k use the new rsh revolver.

[2023-01-04 17:24:29] <%+Dennislewd> the real problem is the recoil @Trey24k  they change that back the game would be 700% better

[2023-01-04 17:34:53] <%F1ckel> its bc when ur drunk ur more relaxed
[2023-01-04 17:34:54] <+PlusUltra30> @porridgeguy WHAT
[2023-01-04 17:34:55] <thedoinkenator> trey spittin
[2023-01-04 17:34:56] <pndaog> Because they are drunk
[2023-01-04 17:34:56] <%boomer_vizion> SO WAIT, we should just all drink and drive then?
[2023-01-04 17:34:56] <%+cfalk00> its cus alcohol relaxes your muscles so when you crash you dont tense up as much i think
[2023-01-04 17:34:56] <%$JuicyZeez> because they are relaxed on impact
[2023-01-04 17:34:56] <%Tonylieh10> It’s casue their body is more relaxed
[2023-01-04 17:34:58] <+AbLE_CF> It's cause they don't tense up
[2023-01-04 17:34:58] <$MceeOG> so was the other person he crashed into tho apparently
[2023-01-04 17:35:00] <%F1ckel> so you absorb impact better
[2023-01-04 17:35:00] <+chris4114> statistically more soba people crash more often than people who are drunk, IM TAKING NO RISKS!
[2023-01-04 17:35:00] <%eebs033> cause the body doesnt react and tense up
[2023-01-04 17:35:00] <SpiritEX> OMEGALUL scav chad peaked that shit
[2023-01-04 17:35:00] <+huweedoo> yes cuase your body is relaxed
[2023-01-04 17:35:01] <%+touchtoneodin22> its because they're drunk and don't tense up
[2023-01-04 17:35:02] <%$king_kob_the_corn_king> @kisukes_hat we just shitting on drunk drivers
[2023-01-04 17:35:03] <+cullykzoo> Sadly that’s because the  drunk body isn’t tense
[2023-01-04 17:35:03] <prepare2carry> its because when your drunk your body goes limp
[2023-01-04 17:35:03] <gkplaysgames_> because you go limp af
[2023-01-04 17:35:04] <%+blackandgold61> Yeah and players apperently dont take them cause they think it ruins contract negotians

[2023-01-04 17:54:32] <+Poesue> i think 56 is perfect for me
[2023-01-04 17:54:33] <imbhu> Trey have you seen kleans Fov video that he released yesterday
[2023-01-04 17:54:33] <+Fusi0nnTV> also depends how close you sit to your monitor
[2023-01-04 17:54:33] <%elimud> i got the 2 fov gletch
[2023-01-04 17:54:34] <+jebenipapa> Some scopes are scuffed at big FOV
[2023-01-04 17:54:34] <%vesseltv> Minimum FOV, stretch res
[2023-01-04 17:54:37] <+theinviam> I play 61fov
[2023-01-04 17:54:37] <%+zGRIZZx> just play on a 55” monitor
[2023-01-04 17:54:37] <%+mitsuguy91> 59 is exactly what I use.
[2023-01-04 17:54:39] <@%stopdodgin> also there's a difference in scope and red dot

[2023-01-04 17:54:42] <%$PlannedRiver> i saw this youtube video about how you can tab out when you pull out your fov giving a better ADS
[2023-01-04 17:54:44] <+iAmBukLuu> literally cant even buy anything to play my raids
[2023-01-04 17:54:45] <StevoHad50> Sound is so loud in this game smaller FOV can be better
[2023-01-04 17:54:52] <%ciditi> that's why i use an FOV of 1 FeelsOkayMan
[2023-01-04 17:54:53] <+aironet> 59-63 is the sweet spot

[2023-01-04 17:55:08] <%SHITTERboi> 420 is a good fov
[2023-01-04 17:55:08] <%+fine_nut> so 1 fov for best performance
[2023-01-04 17:55:08] <%$WushuDeathKICK> 100
[2023-01-04 17:55:09] <portspewley> but with lower you have less overall sight

[2023-01-04 17:55:21] <+Fusi0nnTV> my monitor is kind of close to me so a higher fov works for me

[2023-01-04 18:30:48] <$Fusi0nnTV> you people r dumb
[2023-01-04 18:30:48] <+seepayne1> If they have the right they won’t ask first
[2023-01-04 18:30:50] <%Zumwar> You’re wrong friend. But I’m not going to argue in twitch chat. @death_wing123
[2023-01-04 18:30:50] <+longschlongdamage> and if they dont dont search is illegal and void
[2023-01-04 18:30:51] <+yabba2x> @connakilla is that the one you can choose betwen thera prapor and skier? I like giving it to thera for the injector case
[2023-01-04 18:30:53] <+super_1096> depends on state. but you either get a ticket or you can yes, get arrested.
[2023-01-04 18:30:53] <+Mister_Lahey_> they would arrest you with a suspended license then its search incident to arrest
[2023-01-04 18:30:54] <+fightsdirty> you can be detained and searched
[2023-01-04 18:30:57] <+iRovvan10> they would have to impound the car and get a search warrant @trey24k
[2023-01-04 18:30:58] <%Zumwar> He has to detain.
[2023-01-04 18:30:58] <+mountainman580> Did reshala stop spawning at stronghold ?
[2023-01-04 18:30:59] <bbcrit> in this case i would have died from a headshot

[2023-01-04 18:31:13] <%Zumwar> It’s detainment, arrest comes later
[2023-01-04 18:31:14] <Traxmaeus> He said yes so he looted him on the spot, if he said no he would be taken to the station
[2023-01-04 18:31:16] <diccweedjoe> they need probable cause, suspended liscense isnt enough
[2023-01-04 18:31:19] <%Bryanexmachina> Oklahoma

[2023-01-04 18:31:23] <%+iiRid> If you say no they will detain and search you. You cannot drive a car and not get searched basically
[2023-01-04 18:31:26] <+Mister_Lahey_> no its an arrest able offense and they don't need a search warrant lol
[2023-01-04 18:31:26] <+seepayne1> They won’t ask if they have the right
[2023-01-04 18:31:26] <+death_wing123> @zumwar if cops knew the entire law why would anyone need lawyers lmaoooo
[2023-01-04 18:31:26] <+TallBoy_Ryan> probably texas
[2023-01-04 18:31:27] <$Fusi0nnTV> suspended license is enough dude

[2023-01-04 18:31:45] <+CosmicEclipse_> If a cop has "Reasonable cause" they can search a car
[2023-01-04 18:31:48] <%$SeizeSir> If you deny them to search you, but they do anyway on «probable cause» should you comply or resist?
[2023-01-04 18:31:48] <%Zumwar> Great way to get your point across @fusi0nntv, tell an entire chat their wrong and dumb lmao

[2023-01-04 18:31:53] <%rummeltime> A cop had to let me go bc I wouldn’t let him search,  when he said ok I’m bringing the dog I said,” are you arresting me or am I free to go bc I can’t just be waiting here.”  If you’re not arrested or detained after a certain time they have to let you go
[2023-01-04 18:31:54] <natnabs> LETS GO

[2023-01-04 19:16:02] <cornchad> the game has to cater to new players bro
[2023-01-04 19:16:03] <+death_sigh_tp> all they need to do is decrease recoil while not moving.   even that mp5 would give some control issue while strafeing, i think
[2023-01-04 19:16:07] <cornchad> that's how they sell copies

[2023-01-04 19:16:28] <+doctorofdeath> It would be nice to actually have some skill to controlling recoil. Guns need to have individual recoil patterns that need to be learned. Gives a bigger skill gap.

[2023-01-04 19:16:49] <%Jeminyte> tarkovs recoil isnt realiostic, it comes from the grip

[2023-01-04 19:16:51] <finitehorizons> just annoying to have to fight the inertia + insane recoil + performance issues. like the game is actively working against me  just want fine grained control to be able to express skill

[2023-01-04 19:17:00] <Grosblyth> Nobody can shoot like that in a real combat situation.
[2023-01-04 19:17:03] <+Blitzfirex> he's huddled into a perfect recoil position - most moving/firing isn't hunched over like that, it's shoulders back, strafing, etc.

[2023-01-04 19:17:45] <+UnnoticedLEGACY> To be fair, other than the big bois, Most weapons have minimal recoil. If most of them had crazy amounts they wouldn't use them irl.

[2023-01-04 19:18:23] <%+dieselnj217> my dad made the game. I think I would know how to play

[2023-01-04 19:18:34] <+Goodguygriff> The recoil on all the guns in eft is modeled like pistol recoil, ie. the point of rotation is around the grip, where in real life, when a gun has a stock, the point of rotation is about the shoulder. This is why it seems like the guns in eft recoils so much.

[2023-01-04 19:19:34] <%SteremyJeele> Yeah The point was they changed the recoil and to be "more realistic" and they made it WAY LESS realistic.
[2023-01-04 19:19:34] <VigilantePOV> if they want realism remove recoil basically

[2023-01-04 19:19:43] <%ColeChiIls> @CardiacArrest__ I agree. Klean got most of the exposure for EFT starting out, then Pestily blew up with EFT during 1st drops. My point being is they dont matter.

[2023-01-04 19:20:08] <%CardiacArrest__> @colechiils They don’t even play their own game trey24LULW

[2023-01-04 19:20:13] <Lolzer588> main problem w recoil is that its just not fun
[2023-01-04 19:20:16] <Twinssssss> again trey too much logic
[2023-01-04 19:20:17] <%$Renji_tv> recoil irl is not impossible to control and does not send you looking towards heaven like tarkov guns KEKW

[2023-01-04 19:20:18] <%madmanritz95> i dont like current recoil but the old laser beam shit looks dumb
[2023-01-04 19:20:18] <+plasmapilot> @Trey24k Old tarkov was what made the game popular Pre-INteria/recoil is what made it fun
[2023-01-04 19:20:18] <%+ExplodeHeads> this game is actually realistic if you believe the pmcs are 15 year olds with no military training
[2023-01-04 19:20:19] <%dusttodust6661> you are unreasonable, Brother Man has spoken lol
[2023-01-04 19:20:20] <Aaaaarrgh> is Trey usually this salty?
[2023-01-04 19:20:21] <%+Kanosho> You play as a PMC. A trained mercenary. You should know how to shoot a fking gun. But they make it as if you’re a 110 pound child that never seen a rifle before
[2023-01-04 19:20:21] <+Aeolus_000> people who complain about realism never seem to care that you can do combat surgery on yourself in 15 seconds and pop some ibuprofen to feel no pain
[2023-01-04 19:20:21] <+KHEMIC4L> realism is putting vaseline on your lips to run with your compound fractured leg
[2023-01-04 19:20:24] <%+fine_nut> recoil is bad, inertia is in the direction of good (needs word)
[2023-01-04 19:20:24] <+ShadowEnigma08> LUL
[2023-01-04 19:20:24] <%SteremyJeele> @WookieBandit They didn't, they changed it like 3 wipes ago.
[2023-01-04 19:20:27] <+tebasaki_wing> DONT FORGET OUR CHARACTER IS A PMC WICH IS AN ARMY TRAINED PROFESIONAL ALREADY
[2023-01-04 19:20:27] <%+Dungavon> I’m a trained military personal, this game is as close as you can get to real life warfare. Trust me, I’m a trained military personal. Kappa
[2023-01-04 19:20:27] <%therealslizzyszn> tarkov recoil is equivalent to holding a gun as loose as you can without dropping it, closing your eyes and squeezing the trigger
[2023-01-04 19:20:28] <boxofrockets> I feel like they have just needed everything into oblivion making the same shit meta every single wipe
[2023-01-04 19:20:30] <%+fufubecka923> I just don't like inertia lol
[2023-01-04 19:20:31] <%+iTSantos> idk how people arguin w u as if u dont have triple their hours n game knowledge @Trey24k
[2023-01-04 19:20:31] <harry144444> I think they made recoil like this because people had enough with laser beams.
[2023-01-04 19:20:32] <+IRedMist> In any situation it should be predictable recoil so you can train it
[2023-01-04 19:20:32] <CeasersPleasers> People will get mad at you if you tell them the truth about them sucking lol
[2023-01-04 19:20:33] <Pats93> ad ad spam was bullshit but everything else was fine ( recoil and weight system)
[2023-01-04 19:20:34] <%+sishol_> agree. being able to  run around with sa58 was so much fun before they killed off that gun entirely
[2023-01-04 19:20:36] <+ClasterOG> I can't get over how the smallest calibers in the game have more recoil than 7.62
[2023-01-04 19:20:36] <%$OllyWombat> @Trey24k it would be cool if they kept the beginning recoil similar but actual had an end game in sight where you could have a more realistic recoil

[2023-01-04 19:20:44] <countincaskets> real
[2023-01-04 19:20:44] <%+SaltyBoiSean> Have they ever changed anything like recoil system mid wipe or is that always a wipe change?
[2023-01-04 19:20:45] <%ColeChiIls> @CardiacArrest__ Most devs dont... they dont have time. I see this same silly talking point in every game man. It means nothing just like saying Pest and Klean ruined the game

[2023-01-04 19:20:52] <%+nbell6697> They don’t even acknowledge it too. Also didn’t they cancel that weapon balance meeting you were supposed to have?
[2023-01-04 19:20:52] <BingBongMcgee> actually they can have an opinion but it wil be disregarded
[2023-01-04 19:20:54] <+OuchThatStings> @Trey24k wonder if someone will ever host a private server of Tarkov on older patches like they do with WoW expansions

[2023-01-04 19:21:01] <$RoboChris_> KEKW
[2023-01-04 19:21:01] <%cleeterrr> pigeons arent real
[2023-01-04 19:21:01] <Garretttravis> instead of making recoil realistic, they made the first several shots insanely unrealistic and the rest of the mag kinda realistic.

[2023-01-04 19:21:51] <Legacyyz__> they should make old school tarkov like osrs and rs3

[2023-01-04 19:22:47] <+Iuc1d1ty> when was the recoil change
[2023-01-04 19:22:48] <Prophet991> Tarkov is probably the best shooter on the market.. but in the same breath it fails in a lot of ways

[2023-01-04 19:22:54] <MerckQT> @chronictoker902 Yep.  Find me something better ill play it..
[2023-01-04 19:22:54] <%madmanritz95> ya it makes bursts unusable which is dumb

[2023-01-04 19:23:04] <%ciditi> just tighten up the recoil and make full auto drain your arm stam much faster

[2023-01-04 19:23:25] <benendetto> its just your PMC being surprised at recoil every time
[2023-01-04 19:23:26] <%ColeChiIls> @CardiacArrest__ Name a change they got put in, that BSG wouldnt have done on their own. I can name more things that arent in or took longer to get in because of backlash

[2023-01-04 19:23:27] <%$king_kob_the_corn_king> @kisukes_hat REEEEEEE
[2023-01-04 19:23:28] <+RING3RR> honestly, keep all skills but scrap recoil skill that way they can give the guns realistic recoil without players having to level recoil skill to even get close to realistic recoil. pretty sure the only reason recoil is the way that it is is because they want the recoil skill to have purpose
[2023-01-04 19:23:28] <%+zGRIZZx> Should pry Zero to 150 up there
[2023-01-04 19:23:30] <+dustythejedi> burst fire should be better than mag dump

[2023-01-04 19:23:38] <+ungodly18> Is it @offsane do loot runs and focus on just looting and getting out avoid players if you can help it and avoid high traffic areas at the start of a raid, you want to try to maximise getting as much money as you can per slot in bags, rigs etc, grab extra rigs that fit in bags and carry more than the slots they use to maximise loot, most of all good luck

[2023-01-04 19:35:41] <FunnymaenDipaleo> @gustavo_fring52 refresh rate on that thermal makes it ghard to aim and hit people so he uses it on a mp9 and for longer use and spots with it.
[2023-01-04 19:35:43] <%$WushuDeathKICK> i do enjoy the raider spawn though but reserve was wayyy more fun before tunnels

[2023-01-04 19:41:43] <MerckQT> On LABS everyone hacks so there is no need to report anyone.  Technically labs is a haven where hackers mostly dont get banned.  Think about that.  They and streamers also make BSG the most money.

[2023-01-04 20:08:05] <+RaiderChaseTV> depends how expired the tags are. Within 30 days it’s usually just a ticket

[2023-01-04 20:08:17] <+Sweatysockz> I think it's always good to be in the spirit of cooperation so they dont' choose the most extreme option

[2023-01-04 20:50:21] <@%^StreamElements> the stupidest thing about it is if they really wanted to ban cheaters it would be easy all they gotta look for is codes that have been changed if u know coding u understand what i mean its not hard to find out when someone changes the codes the only reason they don’t is cuz the money the cheaters bring its facts technically they could make a dummy server and anyone with changed codes aka cheaters could be singled out and always sent to a dummy server

[2023-01-04 22:46:40] <fartymartyparty> you have more experience with pipes
[2023-01-04 22:46:49] <+Jrottz86_tv> Flir has better magnification but is also inaccurate and delayed imagining @Trey24k
[2023-01-04 22:46:52] <+nu33ets> I mean it's all relative. FLIR and REAP are both super expensive. It's not gear fear at that point its just preference
[2023-01-04 22:46:54] <+georgaroni> @georgaroni joking or serious?
[2023-01-04 22:47:03] <TheRattitude> Can't believe Trey isn't aiming for the pipes
[2023-01-04 22:47:07] <+dirtydocjeff> Flir pog. I’ve killed a lot of ai with flir

[2023-01-04 22:47:16] <%$king_kob_the_corn_king> flir would be sicc if you could hold it in your hand

[2023-01-04 23:36:24] <mrfreeland1995> 100$  is not enough to bring to court therefore, no need for police
[2023-01-04 23:36:25] <Decimatee> @Trey24k idiots. she will just keep stealing more if you dont do something...
[2023-01-04 23:36:29] <CosbyZombie> It was the way she smuggly said "yeah"
[2023-01-04 23:36:29] <%Locz> i mean depends on how bad that bathroom was. she wanted a tip LUL
[2023-01-04 23:36:30] <RLKallday> at my work, they couldnt press charges till it was over like 300$ so they just let her keep doing it till the total was high enough lol
[2023-01-04 23:36:31] <+xV4P1Dx> I think she should be fired, but pressing charges is a little overboard
