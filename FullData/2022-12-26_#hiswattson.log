[2022-12-26 16:27:09] <Flaming_Granny> My favorite character is the reaper guy. he is very powerfull. special move, honestly is one of the best in the game and so he comes equipped with these two revolvers and only takes about 3 or 4 shots to actually execute a kill so it comes really in handy specially when you come from the side.

[2022-12-26 17:00:51] <@%$turtleTiff> pro players arent all that. i bet i could beat any pro in a iso 1v1. ive even killed pro players in ranked games (i third partied and camped banners, so what? its the game). and then look at all these fanboys crawling up the pros butts to defend them. pathetic.

[2022-12-26 17:06:10] <%Superboy8665> still would be crying if wattson killed gold on his main so this convo is pointless
[2022-12-26 17:06:15] <ItsDCollins> Keep bringing my name and what I do up to take away from the alting account situation
[2022-12-26 17:06:21] <+L10NH3XRT> @itsdcollins Shut up and just get better omg. Blaming others for your lack of skill

[2022-12-26 17:06:36] <johnnytwotimed> @ItsDCollins no bro. No one actually carres. If they complain about it they just want to avoid accepting they suck and need to get better. Gtf over it
[2022-12-26 17:06:42] <1josie5> @ItsDCollins you are acting like the pros that have alt accounts play on them all the time they usually only do bronze to pred then stop using them

But do pay attention to recoil and how to compensate with micro adjustments.   Training dummies are good for recoil learning
