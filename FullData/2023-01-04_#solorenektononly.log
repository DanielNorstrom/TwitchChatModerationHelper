[2023-01-04 18:41:38] <@%+Skexxies> lasted longer than the whole morde ult duration
[2023-01-04 18:41:44] <+mikehunt79> he R'd to get away in there
[2023-01-04 18:41:45] <+SuedeCroc> 5 seconds
[2023-01-04 18:42:00] <!%$Onubin> I don't think it can time out while in the ult @Skexxies
[2023-01-04 18:42:01] <%LetheTheForgetfulRiver> @Skexxies He can't take E back while CC'd and apparently Morde R counts

[2023-01-04 18:42:06] <%$Mcsevem77> @fist0ffist if he in mord R, it stops him from returning until mord R ends
[2023-01-04 18:42:09] <+mikehunt79> @Onubin it can't
[2023-01-04 18:42:38] <@%+Skexxies> ok, but then why doesn't it just cancel leaving him in place, that means morde R EXTENDS his E duration, which seems backwards

[2023-01-04 18:45:29] <+mikehunt79> I think when you have a game that's been around so long such as league/WoW, you end up with a chunk of the player base that just end up being malcontents about everything in the game.
