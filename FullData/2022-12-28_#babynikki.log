[2022-12-28 17:22:14] <%the_shire_fox> @awesomeandrew30 It's not great up close against a SMG unless you get the jump on them.  It's best at midrange when you catch people in the open not looking.  Then you clean up.

[2022-12-28 17:45:53] <beepb00pbl0p> But skill doesn‚Äôt correlate with diversity
[2022-12-28 17:46:04] <%+Iucentgg> @beepb00pbl0p It‚Äôs just purely because of how good you are, there‚Äôs no quotas or anything
[2022-12-28 17:46:19] <+feelthekearn> 100% thats why i havent played it lol
[2022-12-28 17:46:20] <%sleepyheyo> mmm kind of
[2022-12-28 17:46:22] <+JaisonVas> Watching Tarkov is nothing like actually playing it LOL
[2022-12-28 17:46:26] <%+Iucentgg> @beepb00pbl0p yes, ALGS is there to reward skill, not to reward people who are diverse
[2022-12-28 17:46:27] <%sleepyheyo> there's an opportunity issue there
[2022-12-28 17:46:27] <%DevilPeaches75> @beepb00pbl0p its compete to be in, if you play well your in if not, you not. has nothing to do with anything else

[2022-12-28 17:47:05] <beepb00pbl0p> Im not talking about quotas or ‚Äútokenism‚Äù but more about the greater diversity of who gets to compete in general @iucentgg
[2022-12-28 17:47:17] <+JaisonVas> @posajdin Being in that mall.. at night.. AND ITS RAINING üò¨üò¨üò¨
[2022-12-28 17:47:19] <Lyserberg1> @seanwlk not in the way you're implying though. Plenty of girls can compete on the ALGS level. The culture is just not primed to give them the opportunities they need.
[2022-12-28 17:47:33] <%+Iucentgg> @beepb00pbl0p everyone gets a chance to qualify, there is no favouritism in terms of gender race etc
[2022-12-28 17:47:43] <Waterfault> I feel like most people don't want diversity for the sake of having diversity in the competitive esports world. I think any gamer would not want to be given a "handout" based on their gender, race, age, etc.
[2022-12-28 17:47:44] <lilrodwave2> bro I hate when people have a mic and you say don't pick you apex character and they pick it

[2022-12-28 17:48:06] <cynthiaonyi> Is so unfortunate that lan will be hosted on Europe instead of Japan or Brazil
[2022-12-28 17:48:24] <+feelthekearn> @beepb00pbl0p catering to diversity over skill kinda takes away from everyone else who has grinded to get there regardless of race, gender, or ethnicity
[2022-12-28 17:48:27] <%sleepyheyo> @Lyserberg1 yupp this
[2022-12-28 17:48:28] <%+Iucentgg> @beepb00pbl0p if that‚Äôs what your wondering, then no, there isn‚Äôt any barrier to entry, everyone is welcome to compete, but only the best get to qualify for ALGS, regardless of your background
[2022-12-28 17:48:31] <%Nick_N3reus> Seriously enjoyed your ALGS watch parties recently, happy holidays!
[2022-12-28 17:48:33] <beepb00pbl0p> Yeahhh what I mean is not to give people spots regarding having them as tokens but why is it that despite the number of people who want to go pro there are only a few selected. I think it has to do with opportunity
[2022-12-28 17:48:35] <+LordCarterr> At the Raleigh LAN they had the girl gamers org come onto the stage and speak, that was cool to see

[2022-12-28 17:49:07] <Lyserberg1> @iucentgg that's true, but you can't deny that girls and BIPOC get a lot less of the same opportunities granted to their counterparts, and many just can't even *afford* to compete on a baseline because of long-established prejudices in the industry

[2022-12-28 17:49:25] <%+Iucentgg> @beepb00pbl0p it has to be exclusive, therefore being a pro league, if it‚Äôs not selective then there‚Äôs no pro league
[2022-12-28 17:49:30] <beepb00pbl0p> Yes i agree with this @lyserberg1
[2022-12-28 17:49:46] <+karlo5z> NA also has a larger number of teams to qualify, so by a rule of numbers, ALGS has to protect themselves by field the region with the most teams to field.
[2022-12-28 17:49:54] <beepb00pbl0p> @iucentgg it can be exclusive without being a ‚Äúboys club‚Äù environment.

[2022-12-28 17:50:24] <%+Iucentgg> @lyserberg1 I agree, but at the end of the day, if you are good enough, you will find yourself on a top team regardless, the players are there to earn money, they will quite easily put aside there prejudice if that means more in there pocket

[2022-12-28 17:54:26] <%+H_Fuller> I know for OWL you make an open team, win that, compete in Contenders, and get drafted to Overwatch League. I assume ALCS has a similar structure. you try out for teams, and the highest skill players get selected. right?

[2022-12-28 18:00:02] <%+H_Fuller> @beepb00pbl0p who is an underrepresented person that's actively trying to make it onto an ALCS team, that's better than what they have? not being rude, I actually want to know
[2022-12-28 18:00:02] <1_ExMachine> yea i agree with chat , apex is dead
[2022-12-28 18:00:31] <rokyon> ded gaem LUL

[2022-12-28 18:00:54] <rokyon> I can still find matches in 30 seconds I don't think it's dead at all
[2022-12-28 18:00:55] <Lyserberg1> Also the Lulu shit about her not getting any money from the skin is crazy
[2022-12-28 18:01:03] <+feelthekearn> @Lyserberg1 ow is more fun to watch her play anyway she has more fun
[2022-12-28 18:01:08] <+Woven_Storm> I would say Apex is Stale not dead

[2022-12-28 18:01:20] <beepb00pbl0p> I read some stuff on the inner workings of competitive esports and how they‚Äôve become a very destructively exclusive environment as to who can compete. Anyone can watch but only ‚Äúcertain‚Äù people can compete‚Ä¶
[2022-12-28 18:01:21] <!idkchas> nattttHey
[2022-12-28 18:01:24] <+JaisonVas> @lyserberg1 @feelthekearn That‚Äôs really too bad. She‚Äôs been through a lot cuz of Apex alone
[2022-12-28 18:01:24] <+feelthekearn> @Woven_Storm yes id say so as well
[2022-12-28 18:01:24] <rokyon> Apex the only shooter I enjoy
[2022-12-28 18:01:33] <rokyon> Usually I just play RPGs
[2022-12-28 18:01:34] <%+Iucentgg> Lulu called out Apex and shi so I doubt she‚Äôs coming back any time soon, although she did move to a game owned and operated by Blizzard cleaveeePorvalo
[2022-12-28 18:01:36] <beepb00pbl0p> @lyserberg1 of course ü•∞ tyty
[2022-12-28 18:01:39] <+JaisonVas> Good for Lulu tho for branching out tho

[2022-12-28 18:05:21] <beepb00pbl0p> @iucentgg the issue isn‚Äôt a case study of one person. I‚Äôm saying that there is a problem when there are people picked after considering skill at same levels

[2022-12-28 18:05:22] <%+H_Fuller> @beepb00pbl0p okay, so it's just theoretical exclusions? not anyone in particular placing in qualifiers and being excluded? just streamers and viewers saying "you should be MLG" and expecting teams to scout?
