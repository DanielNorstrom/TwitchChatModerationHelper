[2022-12-09 10:11:14] <%ForkytheSquirrel> big brain move
[2022-12-09 10:11:35] <%AlphaPrimaris> The Dreadnought is essentially a walking tank, with the Techmarine being its loader and maintainer
[2022-12-09 10:12:09] <%AlphaPrimaris> So if the Dreadnought runs out of ammo, then you’d need the Techmarine t reload it for him

[2022-12-09 12:23:32] <%Ashtaeroth> @AlphaPrimaris The mechanic changes were like stacking overtwatch to make a killzone, if I understood correct
[2022-12-09 12:23:33] <%AlphaPrimaris> I figured it’s the higher difficulty though making them more aggressive
[2022-12-09 12:23:56] <%AlphaPrimaris> @ashtaeroth aah, makes sense
[2022-12-09 12:24:18] <%ForkytheSquirrel> well, if it's the difficulty level, then it's good that it doesn't just give the AI bonuses etc.
[2022-12-09 12:24:49] <%ForkytheSquirrel> like bonus health. actually having more difficult abilities is good
