[2022-12-22 13:43:57] <yormmss> i have a random question but i feel like i can ask here and you’d be honest… when working out say biceps do you do exercises for the long head, short head etc or do you do compound

[2022-12-22 13:46:39] <t3h_f0x> the contraction you make and where you make it is what works the different heads of the bicep, the beginning portion (arm fully extended) usually works the long head, the short head is exercised when the arm is more bent and closer to the shoulder
[2022-12-22 13:46:40] <LS_SniipeS> does anyone else hate how slow u need to land to prevent damage to the heli. like why LUL

[2022-12-22 13:47:41] <t3h_f0x> short head of bicep is under the long head, the long head is what gets your arm moving and the short head is what brings the contraction fully up
