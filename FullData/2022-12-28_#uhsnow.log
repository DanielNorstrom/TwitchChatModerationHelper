[2022-12-28 17:37:34] <%$X4320> call me old fashioned or weird, but i overall dislike games that have no dedicated server options. at least those were moderated and banned cheaters uhsBoomer hossSadge

[2022-12-28 17:38:00] <SmartTechGuy> tarkov servers die?
[2022-12-28 17:38:33] <+Stimo> Is the low fps in game or on the stream?
[2022-12-28 17:38:35] <Beopuppy85> @uhSnow If you want to lvl any weapon up for unlocks u can run vs AI for a map and do it that way. Bit cheesy but quick
[2022-12-28 17:38:39] <%$X4320> aww cmon
[2022-12-28 17:38:39] <%Snairy> @SmartTechGuy Yeah, Tarkov finally loaded, but now I have a blank screen so still not great

[2022-12-28 17:39:05] <%Stealthkillah122> @x4320 cod 4 was the worst xD people would host servers saying like no shotgun no sniper ect purely because they were trash and could not use them. so i used them and got ba nned from so many servers  😅😅
