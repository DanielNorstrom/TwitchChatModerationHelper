[2022-12-16 20:34:11] <%L0mashu> they barely pass the dps check in hc, no way anyone passes it on mythic without way higher ilvl
[2022-12-16 20:34:16] <%trexxustv> thats not true, limit just woke up not long ago, so they are 1 day ahead theoreticly
[2022-12-16 20:34:16] <@%+Karmacodee> then plot twist
[2022-12-16 20:34:18] <@%+Karmacodee> more splits

[2022-12-16 20:36:23] <%+epzo93> I dont even know the point of arguing what is best, the guilds decide their tactics and we just watch and enjoy. No need to put more effort into it as a viewer.
[2022-12-16 20:36:23] <@Ninzel> Chatting I have seen 15000 futures and I can say this is the last split for now

[2022-12-16 20:37:02] <%trexxustv> i never said they lost the race, i said what they do is very risky, as its 1st raid of exp, and its never super hard, and currently Echo does raid prep like for last raid of exp, it might work, but might be too late, thats what im saying
[2022-12-16 20:37:17] <%DiskoKjell> actually wellplayed, u made urself a copypasta
[2022-12-16 20:37:24] <%shadowsundertide> @trexxustv yea who asked tho

[2022-12-16 23:16:06] <da_gud> sushi is life bro
[2022-12-16 23:16:20] <@%B3nbu> no
[2022-12-16 23:16:21] <%UntameablePear> sushi is art bro
[2022-12-16 23:16:24] <%UntameablePear> its like
[2022-12-16 23:16:32] <%UntameablePear> small pieces of rice and they get them to stick
[2022-12-16 23:16:35] <%UntameablePear> Thats sick yo
[2022-12-16 23:16:45] <%+bbyvee> that's a good wisdom
[2022-12-16 23:16:55] <@%B3nbu> nr 1 reason why sushi isn't food
[2022-12-16 23:17:02] <@%B3nbu> is because the protein is raw
[2022-12-16 23:17:16] <@Ninzel> you take that back sir
