[2023-01-06 07:22:14] <+ShesLikeTexas> @RictusHD Unless you shoot subsonic with a suppressor, I see no point tbh. It would just be better to have a regular 5.56 at that point

[2023-01-06 07:22:57] <RictusHD> @ShesLikeTexas 300 just bigger and does more dmg and performs better out of a shorter barrel. i just think its a cool round and makes for a better pistol than 5.56
[2023-01-06 07:23:08] <RictusHD> @ShesLikeTexas 5.56 better in a longer barrel
[2023-01-06 07:23:08] <+bzornes1213> @themortalwombat no it's like a 20 frames different

[2023-01-06 07:24:11] <RictusHD> @ShesLikeTexas thought about it but the only 5.7 i would get is the pistol.

[2023-01-06 07:52:10] <@%^Nightbot> @ddaanniielll  Chatters can fight to time each other out for 10 minutes. To start a fight, redeem the 3333 channel point option and @ your opponent. If they accept, both participants say !roll to roll a number. The higher roll wins, and the lower roll gets a time out. Ties are a reroll.

[2023-01-06 07:53:51] <Clapp1ty> @waffle_sallad happens more often once i enter streets i feels like.

[2023-01-06 07:53:58] <+maxi_max11> sorry im might look stupid but what is a memory leak^
[2023-01-06 07:53:59] <damooseninja> this game has had mem leaks for a while, every time they update a new map or expansion
[2023-01-06 07:54:15] <waffle_sallad> how does it get fixed?

[2023-01-06 07:54:28] <ZeroDivide1> can someone who's technical explain what a memory leak actually is and why it causes low FPS? üëÄ
[2023-01-06 07:54:28] <Clapp1ty> @waffle_sallad ask BSG Kappa
[2023-01-06 07:54:35] <realkrappyyy_> just ordered everything for a new rig. hope to get 50fps on streets after LUL

[2023-01-06 07:54:51] <damooseninja> @maxi_max11 the game causes the system to get bogged down in laymans terms
[2023-01-06 07:54:53] <+yaboiwater25> @maxi_max11 pretty sure your game stops using the memory as efficiently as it should, restarting once you notice the lag usually works for me

[2023-01-06 07:55:25] <+supermanxce> memory leak is when the game uses more memory than it should
[2023-01-06 07:55:31] <%paladzin> axeltvReady
[2023-01-06 07:55:32] <bubbadoug> @ZeroDivide1 It's like when you are filling up a glass of water and it starts overflowing because there is to much data flowing through the cup
[2023-01-06 07:55:34] <@%727life> Yup LUL

[2023-01-06 07:55:46] <+Eugyolo> @hitman_shum U are part of TAW and act like that, dayum
[2023-01-06 07:55:48] <+supermanxce> which tarky has done since 2016, gets fixed for a little then back to using too much again
[2023-01-06 07:55:51] <%SatolboGT> when memory gets allocated, it needs to be deallocated to make room for other stuff... in this case the used memory keeps growing

[2023-01-06 08:24:21] <@%^Nightbot> @drunk_knifin  Chatters can fight to time each other out for 10 minutes. To start a fight, redeem the 3333 channel point option and @ your opponent. If they accept, both participants say !roll to roll a number. The higher roll wins, and the lower roll gets a time out. Ties are a reroll.

[2023-01-06 08:55:22] <+JokerAssassin_21> @LootPeasant that's very fair lol maybe the visual recoil could be adjusted somehow? I just feel like other than the recoil issue it could make the game feel a ton better. I'm biased though being used to 105-120 fov on most games.
[2023-01-06 08:55:22] <+quietpro83> how long has @kevxxd been playing?

[2023-01-06 09:18:53] <LootPeasant> i found a merin car key, why is it worth so much?
[2023-01-06 09:19:02] <%Opivyh8su> I have a garand in the background for my zoom at work - have had a lot of comments
[2023-01-06 09:19:07] <CXDVanity> you just gained another follower not like me following matters compared to your others but hey new streamer i found that i actually like waching

[2023-01-06 09:19:28] <yergoood> hi
[2023-01-06 09:19:36] <dGame> @hahavole the driver? or what did you do to fix it?
[2023-01-06 09:19:49] <CXDVanity> i like watching you gingy and walker my three favorites i love pestilly but lately ive been looking for different streamers
[2023-01-06 09:19:49] <+VVieselflink> Does the Key also work for the Merins at Streets?
[2023-01-06 09:19:49] <%+morlloft> have you try playing in 2k?
[2023-01-06 09:20:16] <+dippity_dab> its nice
[2023-01-06 09:20:17] <%B3nd3rLIVE> @Opivyh8su Danke f√ºr das Geschenkabo!
[2023-01-06 09:20:20] <$Alucard_DracuIa> My friend have almost same specs as me, the only difference is that he has AMD CPU and 32 gigs of RAM, he got on avarage +20 fps more than me
[2023-01-06 09:20:22] <CXDVanity> praying you get a really good raid
[2023-01-06 09:20:23] <%Opivyh8su> Good luck this run! Watch the recoil
[2023-01-06 09:20:23] <hahavole> @dGame had to return the GPU to a servis, dunno what they did, worked after, a way to find that out is something like safemode in windows, it boots your pc on the integrated graphic on your cpu
[2023-01-06 09:20:27] <+quietpro83> I went from 1080 to 1440, now I can't see anything in 1080 , wtf?
[2023-01-06 09:20:29] <furiousjokerttv> @axel_tv what quest gives you the injector case @ chat
[2023-01-06 09:20:32] <herm1tt_k> i'm looking into settings right now. Streets just humiliated my RTX3080 rig down to 20 FPS, while 80-110 on other maps..
[2023-01-06 09:20:38] <WATCHFORTHEFLASH> do i need to plant all 3 ambulance in one raid for health care privacy?
[2023-01-06 09:20:50] <Jorwol> 20 fps is way too low for 3080, what resolution do you use
[2023-01-06 09:21:00] <%+kevxxd> yea, once you get used to 2k there is no way you are playing fullhd again
[2023-01-06 09:21:04] <+zbowen101> @furiousjokerttv Chemical part 4 but you turn the quest into Therapist not Prapor or Skier
[2023-01-06 09:21:05] <+KanoNZL> Health care privacy?
[2023-01-06 09:21:08] <Derang3r> @furiousjokerttv Chemical Pt.4 when you hand in to therapist
[2023-01-06 09:21:09] <+quietpro83> I have a 3089ti, and average around 80-100 fps
[2023-01-06 09:21:10] <friedbiscuitgaming> how come pestily pulls 150k 200k people when drops are on but the rest of you only get 20 to 40 k
[2023-01-06 09:21:14] <herm1tt_k> @Jorwol 1440p native

[2023-01-06 09:21:21] <+supermanxce> @herm1tt_k try disabling binural audio, also tarky dont care about gpu, it cares about your ram and cpu
[2023-01-06 09:21:23] <WATCHFORTHEFLASH> or can i do the 2 next to each other extract and come back for 1 at resort?
[2023-01-06 09:21:24] <furiousjokerttv> Ty Ty for the answers
[2023-01-06 09:21:26] <captain_cheesepuffs> @friedbiscuitgaming He's definitely the most well known Tarkov streamer
[2023-01-06 09:21:30] <TheMortalWombat> no it's chemical 4 ya?
[2023-01-06 09:21:31] <+zbowen101> its Out Of Curiosity i think
[2023-01-06 09:21:32] <+dippity_dab> damn thats a good key
[2023-01-06 09:21:35] <+Saya_> whats was this key btw ?
[2023-01-06 09:21:39] <Derang3r> "Out of Curiosity" i think
[2023-01-06 09:21:39] <shepk930> Isn't it one of the optional rewards for who you hand chemical in to
[2023-01-06 09:21:39] <+Stxrmiiez> what res is good for more fps?
[2023-01-06 09:21:41] <xXOblivionDarkXx> its Out Of Curiosity
[2023-01-06 09:21:44] <+radartechnician> It‚Äôs the quest where you can also give to prapor and skier
[2023-01-06 09:21:47] <+zbowen101> but its the Chemical questline
[2023-01-06 09:21:55] <snakumaru> thank you for showing fps counter. always interesting to see how it runs on streamer setups.
[2023-01-06 09:21:57] <xXOblivionDarkXx> its therapist Out Of Curiosity for the injector
[2023-01-06 09:22:01] <Liter0fcola> why do all of the streamers i see playing tarkov play on 1080p instead of 1440p?
[2023-01-06 09:22:05] <+t12lve> lower res = cpu bound
[2023-01-06 09:22:11] <spyccodename> i still haven't extracted from streets
[2023-01-06 09:22:16] <+brinnhild> i wish dlss was better on this game
[2023-01-06 09:22:18] <+Stxrmiiez> im just confused to why i have good pc parts but getting 40 fps on customs
[2023-01-06 09:22:22] <+quietpro83> @stxrmiiez I haven't noticed anything when going from 2k to 108
[2023-01-06 09:22:23] <shmeat> native stretched works okay but anything lower sucks
[2023-01-06 09:22:24] <beauso007> What was the key u used?
[2023-01-06 09:22:25] <ninjaXtream> yepp, i have an rtx 7900 xtx and resolution doesnt matter between 2k and full hd
[2023-01-06 09:22:28] <LootPeasant> just switched to 1440p, its amazing
[2023-01-06 09:22:28] <+quietpro83> to 1080 on my rig
[2023-01-06 09:22:30] <+Stxrmiiez> ive tried Lvndmarks settings, pestily, axels, bakeezy
[2023-01-06 09:22:30] <friedbiscuitgaming> @friedbiscuitgaming yeah but the numbers are a bit weird if you ask me people only care for the drops not the streamer but his got so many more view botting ?
[2023-01-06 09:22:31] <%Opivyh8su> CPU is the limiter for Tarkov more than GPU
[2023-01-06 09:22:58] <+griffon017> nice room

[2023-01-06 11:17:39] <+add1ct3dd> if you have power spikes it can kill your pc
[2023-01-06 11:17:43] <%Warnoq> any modern PSU has surge protection in it guys, you dont need a power strip
[2023-01-06 11:17:43] <%nemes_365> UPS is a backup battery
[2023-01-06 11:17:44] <+add1ct3dd> surge protector stops that

[2023-01-06 11:17:53] <+MoodWai> In case of power surge (ie : thunderstorm) it will fry your PC
[2023-01-06 11:17:54] <raventhornxd> UPS is a battery system that stays on for a bit when the power goes out

[2023-01-06 11:18:46] <%tinninches> @AFineDjent why not 4?
[2023-01-06 11:18:49] <+MoodWai> The main benefit is that if the power goes off you have a few minutes to save your work

If they accept, both participants say !roll to roll a number. The higher roll wins, and the lower roll gets a time out. Ties are a reroll.

[2023-01-06 11:50:37] <Joysenz1> @NimpuTV So this game uses alot of ram, and once it takes all your ram it starts using hard disk, thats why I have told you to change your File Paging to another disk, so it has more space for usage

[2023-01-06 11:54:09] <@%^Nightbot> @balmylimee  Chatters can fight to time each other out for 10 minutes. To start a fight, redeem the 3333 channel point option and @ your opponent. If they accept, both participants say !roll to roll a number. The higher roll wins, and the lower roll gets a time out. Ties are a reroll.

[2023-01-06 13:15:06] <%calvinj> Do you not change gasblock on m4?
[2023-01-06 13:15:09] <%ALTernateFox> white name means that cheapest version of the game, so the most expensive ones are not that "effective" for cheaters -> they're usually using only cheap accounts, while many ppl upgrade the version

[2023-01-06 13:46:34] <omitsch_> @DomsterDK most guys have yellow names because they buy the most expensive version and cheaters would buy just the cheap version because they can get banned

[2023-01-06 13:47:14] <+Mriswith2k> try overlooking the houses at car extract, you can normally get some 40m there
