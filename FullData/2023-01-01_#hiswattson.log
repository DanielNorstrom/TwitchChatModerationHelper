[2023-01-01 15:01:32] <%DtSkyy> i have a conspiracy theory. could it be that wattson switches to his alts to intentionally run it down ignorant to ensure his team mates dont gain RP, thus cementing his main account's place on the leaderboards. its both genius and despicable.

[2023-01-01 16:02:21] <+nuudez> He is probably doing multiple apps for delivery. I used to do it and to not kill my time, I would put as delivered sometimes.
[2023-01-01 16:02:28] <buttersthefett> It's especially more frustrating when you tip well before they mess up your delivery
[2023-01-01 16:02:32] <%$thank_ufor_subscribing> Honestly with how much they get paid for uber eats I don't blame them for stealing food sometimes

[2023-01-01 16:21:52] <horizon716> scans  are the truth tbh especially with the 3rd parties and and rats
[2023-01-01 16:21:53] <%SpiderMonk31> Seer ult pulse indicator good idea. Pulses faster the lower they are in HP.

[2023-01-01 16:24:05] <%DanGlee_Ballz> Character where the tactical is dead silence, the ult is the ability to assassinate.
[2023-01-01 16:24:13] <777raw777> is should like there is no op scan character  like seer that has basicalyl wh but it should be inbetween so there is an indication when someone rats

[2023-01-01 16:24:29] <+BischLaden> Nerf the current scan characters, add a stackable grenade that you can throw the emits like 3 pulses or something. Carry like 3 in one slot
[2023-01-01 16:24:33] <%Just0tis> Scan meta is necessary but shouldn't be for too long
[2023-01-01 16:24:35] <code_prometheus> scan legends shouldnt be so OP like seer
[2023-01-01 16:24:41] <derzggrgr> if u have a full team alive u should be perma scanned if camping in 1 spot. best way to fix that imo LUL
[2023-01-01 16:24:45] <+cyxarcotic> Positioning doesn’t matter when you have legends that instantly traverse 50ft in the air, and scan legends
[2023-01-01 16:24:58] <$yungsteazy> Is the cool down for ppsize like 1 min ?
[2023-01-01 16:25:00] <%Op7iMiZeD> Scan meta is not necessary in this game, we were much happier before Seer
[2023-01-01 16:25:04] <+roseboombtcoiler> cod is known for people camping the whole time LUL
[2023-01-01 16:25:05] <brownbrotha> that's very trye

[2023-01-01 16:25:10] <VLuigii> @cyxarcotic hard disagree
[2023-01-01 16:25:12] <Bilalligator> scans need counterplay, which i guess is what catalyst does
[2023-01-01 16:25:13] <%Op7iMiZeD> BH is enough

[2023-01-01 16:25:23] <%castingkautz> if you stay in the same 25m circle, for more than a minute, you show up. ez
[2023-01-01 16:25:25] <brownbrotha> but the current scan meta is too strong

[2023-01-01 16:38:36] <+khornettv> I think we are at a point in time where games need to be installed in some sort of sandbox, with no interaction with other system components what so ever (except ofc Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse) + a watcher that checks every programm that wants to interact with the sandbox.

[2023-01-01 16:44:40] <+khornettv> @HisWattson what is your opinion as a pro on making games more like a sandbox that don't interact with other components other than the GPU / Keyboard / Mouse / Controller and a watcher that checks if something wants to grab information off of the GPU or the sandbox? Something like Valorant has but even more restrictive, to get rid of cheaters once and for all

[2023-01-01 16:48:07] <$Feyldor> @Hobeezy I think he is more talking of he was smurfing prior hittitng pred but honestly nobody cares
[2023-01-01 16:48:12] <+wordplay34> For real, this game has much bigger issues than smurfing
[2023-01-01 16:48:26] <+khornettv> @jacobboutilier on a scale from 1 to 10, how dense are you and why is it breaking the chart with 87 (which is still 50 points higher than your IQ)

[2023-01-01 16:58:10] <DTHR0NED> kc should be a pub map as well
[2023-01-01 16:58:10] <+indiicted> Broken Moon is a pub map for sure
[2023-01-01 16:58:16] <+Versatile337> I think it's horrible as a pub map, it's fun in low ranks, terrible for comp

[2023-01-01 16:59:06] <1kanapizZ1> imo broken moon is the best map👉👈

[2023-01-01 16:59:10] <$Feyldor> foreal I think a vet comp player should design one if they know what it needs
[2023-01-01 16:59:12] <%m1gz1> i miss kings canyon
[2023-01-01 16:59:16] <SUPED03> and what about kings canyon?
[2023-01-01 16:59:23] <Kamil457> true apex experience is WE and KC others are to big
[2023-01-01 16:59:24] <DSnake333> OG Kings Canyon is the best map Kappa
[2023-01-01 16:59:24] <+sinful_desires> you dint like third party canyon Kappa
[2023-01-01 16:59:24] <+aciletti22> Kings canyon was so bad that CLG won a big tournament on it
[2023-01-01 16:59:26] <muchShooting567> @wattsonisagod just git gud kid

[2023-01-01 16:59:31] <+TPO3> I've heard some people say they'd like Broken Moon without the rail system - do you think that would help comp at all?
[2023-01-01 16:59:34] <thewfighter> storm point is better even for pubs for me
[2023-01-01 16:59:35] <bagelbabe_> KC should be deleted from the game
[2023-01-01 16:59:35] <smokeweedz> the best map is broken moon

[2023-01-01 17:00:06] <+khornettv> I think original KC was also a nice map, maybe with some of the adjustments for the northern part of the map would be a legit good competitive map

[2023-01-01 17:59:22] <+KnowbodyGneiss> one thing I learned from watching Watson & Enoch is that they take the shot. Even if the first one misses they shoot again and again and its the number of shots (+skill) that increases their hit percentage. They also generally "stop" and shoot, then move.

[2023-01-01 18:56:09] <@%^Nightbot> HimWattson isn’t so great? Are you kidding me? When was the last time you saw a player with such an ability and movement? HimWattson puts the game in another level, and we will be blessed if we ever see a player with his skill and passion for the game again. TSM_ImperialHal breaks records. HimWattson breaks rules. You can keep your statistics. I prefer the magic.

I told him I managed to achieve a Gold rank in Apex, and that's when everything went sour. He looked at me with disgust, and spat at me. This whole time I thought he was a nice person, I was wrong.

[2023-01-01 19:55:34] <@%BESTGlRL> it was a 400 iq ult we wouldn’t understand

[2023-01-01 19:56:24] <golub_99> might be a dumb question , but do you use recoil smoothing or do you manually control recoil for your guns?
[2023-01-01 19:56:26] <+khornettv> @ekstaaz_fr I mean, I think his ULT is actually fine, maybe, just let him still hold a weapon and shoot but with decreased accuracy when he tries to allign his ult
[2023-01-01 19:56:26] <%+TheAttackDonkey> gibby used his ult becuase in his mind his biggest threat was on the roof
