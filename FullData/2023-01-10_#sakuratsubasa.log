[2023-01-10 05:56:47] <+3GayEmus> i remember phantoon being fairly dangerous when you have what you're intended to have

[2023-01-10 05:57:24] <@%TheInfamousBug> Low% Phantoon is nasty. Especially lacking charge. Charge fixes two of the bigger issues with the fight.
[2023-01-10 05:57:25] <%+murixbob> part of Phantoon being dangerous casually is not knowing that using a super will make it become enraged

[2023-01-10 06:10:21] <@%TheInfamousBug> Essentially all the items are randomized between the games, and everyone has an objective to beat their game(s)
[2023-01-10 06:10:36] <chromapixel> so does it like randomly switch to LTTP?
[2023-01-10 06:10:42] <chromapixel> oh

[2023-01-10 06:11:02] <@%TheInfamousBug> There's certain parts of the world that "Warp" you to the other game
[2023-01-10 06:11:07] <%emteecalories> sadly no. it's a short where a guy writes bubble, water, and ocean then asks you to pick a # between 1-50nbut both digits must be odd and can't be the same digit.

[2023-01-10 08:31:20] <%Ezzlin> You can always play the rando solo to see how long it takes

[2023-01-10 09:37:06] <%Ezzlin> What do you think about the idea of progressive bombs in SMZ3? So you'd always get normal bombs before super bombs

[2023-01-10 11:12:53] <@%Blastoise_M> the lttp player just has to do two seeds then :D
[2023-01-10 11:12:57] <%Ezzlin> You can up the settings on ALTTPR though to balance it, that's what I usually do
[2023-01-10 11:13:35] <%Ezzlin> Sadly though they don't have all the stuff from the door rando project
[2023-01-10 11:14:12] <@%+Skarthe> Alright.  I've gotta go to bed -yeah

[2023-01-10 11:15:20] <iamamitten> oof on the apple
[2023-01-10 11:15:31] <@%+Skarthe> Thanks for the stream, Saku; have a good night, all!
[2023-01-10 11:15:34] <%Ezzlin> Smash could just beat his game and forfeit
[2023-01-10 11:15:40] <%+Zithras2> Oooh it supports Factorio - that'd be a looong multiworld
[2023-01-10 11:16:08] <%Ezzlin> Oh I thought he was ready to beat the game, never mind

[2023-01-10 11:20:04] <%Ezzlin> It would be cool if someone did OOT
[2023-01-10 11:20:18] <%Ezzlin> But maybe with pretty easy settings
[2023-01-10 11:20:20] VIEWERS: 147
[2023-01-10 11:20:34] <@%+Pseudoping27> yeah I'd take off trainersanity next time to keep pace
[2023-01-10 11:20:51] <@%+TheFogz> what is blaze powder?
[2023-01-10 11:21:08] <@%+TheFogz> was it blaze powder I mean
[2023-01-10 11:21:21] <%+Zithras2> minecraft crafting material, drops from blaze enemies, used for crafting blaze rods and potions
[2023-01-10 11:21:40] <@%+TheFogz> because spoiler log isn't showing any results for blaze powder
[2023-01-10 11:21:43] <%+Zithras2> well, you haver to refine it from drops from blaze enemies
[2023-01-10 11:22:20] VIEWERS: 147
[2023-01-10 11:22:51] <%+Zithras2> In the default game, it's just automatically 'there' when you put in a blaze rod, but sounds like a collectible recipe was added for multiworld

[2023-01-10 11:23:12] <%+Zithras2> it might be under blaze rod as well skarthe

[2023-01-10 11:25:42] <%Ezzlin> Ooh, they're adding Zelda 1 support to AP
[2023-01-10 11:25:50] <%+Azzavhar> thats cool :) i saw that EXP for smash pickup. Looks really fun.
[2023-01-10 11:25:52] <%+Itamu> psuedo forgot to !collect before they left?
[2023-01-10 11:26:24] VIEWERS: 153
[2023-01-10 11:26:42] <%+Itamu> it would open all his chests in your world and such
[2023-01-10 11:26:56] <%Ezzlin> I think all you need to do is forfeit
[2023-01-10 11:27:29] <%+Itamu> it essentially means you would have chests and such you'd know not to check now
[2023-01-10 11:27:47] <%+Itamu> it would also give some of the achievement progress to smash

[2023-01-10 11:38:38] <%Ezzlin> There is one concern though... if some people don't want to be spoiled on some games, then I could see not wanting to multi with certain games. Like I really want to Hollow Knight and don't want to see all the item names
[2023-01-10 11:38:52] <OhHeyItJaye> I was doing a paper mario Rando, trying out Coinsanity, but I took some sinus meds that make me loopy so that was really tough ohheyi30LOL
