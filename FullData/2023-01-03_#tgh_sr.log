[2023-01-03 09:41:26] <%NinethLions> Sinnoh starts you on 201.
[2023-01-03 09:41:28] <Zaruvyen> Johto games start you on Route 29.
[2023-01-03 09:41:31] <%sin_pyro> I was about to say, I can probably guess Cryo's pick LUL
[2023-01-03 09:41:37] <%berniebeatsboxes> Cryo said mid btw
[2023-01-03 09:41:43] <Zaruvyen> (Crystal Full Item trainee here. ^^)
[2023-01-03 09:41:43] <Thalfon> Yeah gen 2 starts you on higher route numbers because Kanto still exists in the game.
[2023-01-03 09:41:49] <+jman2050> I thought Kanto WAS the only gen with route 1
[2023-01-03 09:41:57] <%berniebeatsboxes> Actually not terrible
[2023-01-03 09:42:00] <%Kailaria> and Drought
[2023-01-03 09:42:00] <Thalfon> Later ones brought back route 1.
[2023-01-03 09:42:01] <Zaruvyen> Oh wow
[2023-01-03 09:42:01] <%berniebeatsboxes> But it's tanky

[2023-01-03 09:42:36] <%Mirby_Studios> like the first 4 regions are all based in japan so they added 101 and 201, but then all other regions are so completely disconnected they have their own route numbering system
[2023-01-03 09:42:37] <%Kailaria> it looks to be very tanky tho
[2023-01-03 09:42:38] <%+nshade_> drought even
[2023-01-03 09:42:39] <%sin_pyro> Cause it sunk all its stats into HP and Speed?

[2023-01-03 09:42:42] <%+Cryomonoxide> just cryo works
[2023-01-03 09:42:45] <%Mirby_Studios> except paldea which notably has no numbered routes whatsoever

[2023-01-03 09:47:23] <%jacqui_lantern234> is Swords Dance a legal move in this?

[2023-01-03 09:55:48] <%Kailaria> honestly, I'm waiting for TMs that embrace the semi-mixed nature of this mon's offenses
[2023-01-03 09:56:03] <%berniebeatsboxes> We also have pretty decent physical moves as well
[2023-01-03 09:56:05] <%NinethLions> Honestly, a super amazing move to learn would be Growth

[2023-01-03 09:56:26] <CrystalRoseEve> what would you do if metronome used sketch?
[2023-01-03 09:56:27] <%Kailaria> eh, growth isn't as good in this gen
[2023-01-03 09:56:43] <%Kailaria> it only buffs SpA +1, right?
[2023-01-03 09:56:44] <Idixal> Does it synergies with sun this gen?
[2023-01-03 09:56:45] <%NinethLions> Oh wait, it sucks in this gen
[2023-01-03 09:56:46] <%sin_pyro> Tail Glow is 2 stage while Growth is 1 stage right?
[2023-01-03 09:56:50] <%NinethLions> Never mind lol
[2023-01-03 09:56:51] <CrystalRoseEve> would you loose metronome?
[2023-01-03 09:56:53] <itsZenegos> yea growth doesnt do the double in the sun in gen 3 i think
[2023-01-03 09:57:12] <%NinethLions> Growth in gen 5: "Growth now increases the user's Attack by one stage in addition to increasing Special Attack by one stage. In harsh sunlight, Growth raises Attack and Special Attack by two stages each."
[2023-01-03 09:57:15] <%Kailaria> in later gens it doubles as +1 Atk and +1 SpA, but this gen is only +1 SpA
[2023-01-03 09:57:33] <hobrev> indeed
[2023-01-03 09:57:38] <+Bookiegeek> man time sure flies, i wonder if he remembers me
[2023-01-03 09:57:45] <itsZenegos> yea there are moves that metronome cant use, like sketch and mimic

[2023-01-03 10:00:15] <@%AmberCyprian> Without contrary, V-Create has lower PP and the drawback of reducing your stats. It's a nuke, sure, but there's a much wider pool of pokemon, moves, and items in Gen 5 onward that V-Create isn't as impressive as you might think it is in Ironmon

[2023-01-03 10:17:31] <%berniebeatsboxes> Hard to say... but so far doesn't seem like it
[2023-01-03 10:17:46] <%NinethLions> Can't wait for the last move to be Perish Song
[2023-01-03 10:17:52] <hobrev> the total mon count is higher in this afaik
[2023-01-03 10:18:00] <hobrev> so you have a higher chance to run into the run killers
[2023-01-03 10:18:01] <EvilMuffins1> but you can get runs going a lot more reliably right?

[2023-01-03 10:18:27] <%Kailaria> it's longer, but also the game is to defeat Steven (like fighting Red in Crystal) who, in this game, has lvl 100s across the board

[2023-01-03 11:24:42] <Nyancy_Cat> @BaRanchik_7 why would a porygon2 not be viable? over 500bst, one weakness, it learns moves - the right spread and moves and there's no reason it can't win

[2023-01-03 11:25:02] <%Rootballa> dragon dance is mostly just Howl here
[2023-01-03 11:25:06] <bobichesky> So...you're technically obliged to smack all the kids and their parents in the shop to get your soda fix?
[2023-01-03 11:25:12] <BobGobbo> At the end of  the day, at some point in  any kaizo run, you're gonna need to get lucky. You can do tons of things to diminish how often that happens, but ANY run  is gonna have to be a little lucky. Could happen with Arcanine.
[2023-01-03 11:25:50] <%DrGiggles88> more speed just means better chance to still out speed when para'd
[2023-01-03 11:25:57] <lucky__starfish> solar beam would be nice to get

[2023-01-03 11:27:12] <212mochaman> When i hear that arcanine is an unreliable kaizo mon i dont USUALLY think its cause of stats lol
[2023-01-03 11:27:16] <Nyancy_Cat> is that a kaizo rule? because you can catch quaza pre-E4 in Emerald
[2023-01-03 11:27:18] <%2pert> Game is pretty generous with early pivots, FRLG only had forest and then pivot on digglet cave
[2023-01-03 11:27:27] <%LumPhoenix> Can't you catch Rayquaza right after the kyogre/groudon story beat resolves?
[2023-01-03 11:27:28] <%Mirby_Studios> yeah the level would be too low to bother then
[2023-01-03 11:27:38] <%LumPhoenix> It's only kyogre groudon that are actually postgame I thought
[2023-01-03 11:27:42] <Nyancy_Cat> i forgot statics dont get level adjusted

[2023-01-03 11:39:33] <@%Taco_Champ> I loved S&V
[2023-01-03 11:39:51] <@%Taco_Champ> so much so im still playing it
[2023-01-03 11:39:54] <%+ErinusTV> SV is amazing, it's just a shame it wasn't super polished. But I've played MMOs on launch so my bar for "bad launch glitches ruin the game" is pretty high

[2023-01-03 11:40:04] <hobrev> poor koffing, the forgotten mon
[2023-01-03 11:40:08] <ZeAlchemyst> It's a very good game, just bogged down by a very rough appearance and presentation. It being a victim of crunch is quite evident

[2023-01-03 11:41:22] <%DrGiggles88> do you really want the game to show you that answer
[2023-01-03 11:41:24] <212mochaman> surely gen 9 didnt have development crunch? and how is randomly falling to the void all the time a tolerated side effect these days
[2023-01-03 11:41:27] <n_g_da> oh

[2023-01-03 11:42:24] <%Izzy_The_Penguin> Gen 9 had horrendous crunch and clearly far too tight a release deadline
[2023-01-03 11:42:27] <%Kailaria> honestly, yea, the switch is pretty dated hardware at this point
[2023-01-03 11:42:34] <%+ErinusTV> yeah it's very clear they weren't given the appropriate amount of time to clear out all the bugs
[2023-01-03 11:42:36] <212mochaman> i thought gamefreak was always given a loose leash

[2023-01-03 11:42:58] <Chansey_NES> nah just playing the game it seems pretty clear
[2023-01-03 11:43:03] <@%CarloBrown> I didn't get any real bugs or crashes either
[2023-01-03 11:43:05] <Chansey_NES> but still a fun game
[2023-01-03 11:43:05] <+RegularPerson> Is someone crying about a game they never played tomatoSmile
[2023-01-03 11:43:15] <%DrGiggles88> same and i played violet which seems to apparently be the more messed up of the two versions
[2023-01-03 11:43:28] <@%CarloBrown> I only had a little lag in the open world when docked
[2023-01-03 11:43:36] <%+ErinusTV> People think the switch is the problem but if you look at Breath of the Wild which is far bigger with more particle physics and runs at 30fps, you have to think that the project timeline wasn't long enough to finish Scar/Vi
[2023-01-03 11:43:38] <+nfechhter> i agree, i had no issues in 80+hr, but some of the ones on YT are pretty funny
[2023-01-03 11:43:47] <@%Taco_Champ> I did have some visual glitches, but they were hilarious.
[2023-01-03 11:43:53] <%0ldmanbiff> I think a lot of the problem is announcing release dates too early in development cycles.
[2023-01-03 11:43:54] <Chansey_NES> I had it crashing 2 times doing my playthrough
[2023-01-03 11:43:54] <%+Rozalyndis> no game is allowed to have glitches or bugs. single bug, one tiny glitch, game's trash. irredeemable. 0 stars.
[2023-01-03 11:43:57] <%+ErinusTV> yeah people see videos of speedrunners and hackers deliberately trying to break the game without context and assume the game is bad, but you can push ANY game to break like that lol

[2023-01-03 11:44:28] <%IAmYun> i almost fell into the void once but there was a tiny piece of ground i was able to stand on
[2023-01-03 11:44:36] <%DrGiggles88> only real thing that i found that is annoying is that in raid your cursor position gets reset randomly and can sometimes be laggy and not let you make a decision

[2023-01-03 11:44:38] <%Izzy_The_Penguin> It's like the "open letter" format has become the done thing now
[2023-01-03 11:44:41] <%Pitici> Well aside from the bugs, the game is ugly as fuck, that's a given

[2023-01-03 11:46:40] <%+Rozalyndis> the amount of times i've fallen through the world playing warframe? S/V hardly compares
[2023-01-03 11:46:42] <%2pert> It has enough speed to get dragon dance out to outspeed even more
[2023-01-03 11:46:43] <212mochaman> yeah ive beat it already. crashed mid save after 6th gym so yay. im used to bs like that. i HATE that im used to that. its not gamefreak's fault. cause the other 5 times were different devs
[2023-01-03 11:46:45] <Chansey_NES> @DrGiggles88 when riding you "bike" and entering a trainer battle you do not ride anymore after the fight

[2023-01-03 11:48:05] <%+Rozalyndis> personally i just don't care for S/V for totally different reasons--more pertaining to design philosophy

[2023-01-03 11:48:13] <Chansey_NES> scarlet for me as well
[2023-01-03 11:48:23] <%DrGiggles88> i mean if it happens all the time that kind of means its intended not a bug so its not something to complain or list as something wrong
[2023-01-03 11:48:52] <%Zemtor> !bullshi Your opinion on S/V Firin?
[2023-01-03 11:48:52] <%firin_bot> i know this dugtrio sprite is plenty of Germany this good luck with the name makes Thunder Punch from... Loudred Kappa out the bike area is there are wearing nothing for the overview of good night owl jay sorry I think? was not having us!!

[2023-01-03 11:49:18] <%DrGiggles88> i got dismounted at the start of trainer fights i think
[2023-01-03 11:49:24] <+RegularPerson> or C: It was patched
[2023-01-03 11:49:33] <Chansey_NES> let me just check on my game but probably a
[2023-01-03 11:49:33] <$FortyTwoB> you do get dismounted at the beginning of the fight
[2023-01-03 11:49:33] <Ionic_Iris> I know the Scarlet mon is easier to get hyperspeed gliding on
[2023-01-03 11:49:35] <%LumPhoenix> I remember this happening at patch, but I haven't played the game in a while
[2023-01-03 11:49:38] <%IAmYun> im playing it currently and yet you get dismounted for trainer fights
[2023-01-03 11:49:43] <%IAmYun> yes*

[2023-01-03 11:50:41] <212mochaman> cause most hm's u get are from noc's i assume
[2023-01-03 11:50:47] <212mochaman> npc's
[2023-01-03 11:50:52] <+RegularPerson> it auto dismounts you for like, cutscenes n stuff but like idk that's not a huge deal
[2023-01-03 11:50:53] <%DrGiggles88> so its not a bug its an intended mechanic so its like all other gens there is always something people aren't going to like

[2023-01-03 13:56:11] <$GhostKumo> I also kinda just wanna see someone dethrone Werster
[2023-01-03 13:56:36] <%Cryten0> do you think people would complain if they release a new 2d pokemon game after arcues and violet?
[2023-01-03 13:56:42] <@%fsvgm777> The TAS of it is 17 seconds by Izzy.
[2023-01-03 13:56:42] <%Fio_Hart> So is emerald just more kind for heals?
[2023-01-03 13:56:50] <%Cryten0> just a thought
[2023-01-03 13:56:59] <$GhostKumo> Let me answer that question with another question:
[2023-01-03 13:57:24] <%+Multi_bella> @Fio_Hart The soda pop house adds a decent amount
[2023-01-03 13:57:40] VIEWERS: 739
[2023-01-03 13:57:50] <%LumPhoenix> Fun fact, there's no legitimate way to obtain berry juice in vanilla.
[2023-01-03 13:57:50] <$GhostKumo> Do you think any question that contains the clauses "Do you think people would complain" "release" "new" and "Pokemon" would ever be no
[2023-01-03 13:57:52] <itsZenegos> I just hope they stop removing good features on the next releases. Why does SV not have mass release?
[2023-01-03 13:57:58] <%Cryten0> lol no
[2023-01-03 13:58:00] <OnlyBirds> I was able to sleep but now I must wake up early ;_;
[2023-01-03 13:58:03] <%S17Master> @Cryten0 There will be a sector of people that complain about any decision made
[2023-01-03 13:58:05] <$GhostKumo> Well there you go :P
[2023-01-03 13:58:06] <accruenewblue> yea, less bs items than later gens too

[2023-01-03 13:58:25] <OnlyBirds> Glad to see Arcanine still going
[2023-01-03 13:58:28] <$GhostKumo> and tbf it's not even an indictment of Pokemon fans

[2023-01-03 13:58:37] <+Buglaux> Self-destruct hype? KomodoHype
[2023-01-03 13:58:42] <$GhostKumo> Any fanbase that large will have people complain about everything
[2023-01-03 13:58:51] <%LumPhoenix> Why even speculate? They will release a new pokemon until the heat-death of the universe.

[2023-01-03 13:59:50] <$GhostKumo> The biggest reason why that anniversary concert was so special to me was because for the first time in probably my entire life with the internet that I saw the collective of the Sonic fandom agree that they liked something
[2023-01-03 14:00:11] <%Fio_Hart> I think the only criticism i heard about sonic was bad voice acting? i havent played it yet tho
[2023-01-03 14:00:20] <$GhostKumo> Hahahahaha
