[2022-12-17 01:17:41] <%squarebracket1> @6pie9 yes, basically that, your voice will always sound deeper because it will resonate through your body up into your ear better than bass sound does through air

My wife has left me because apparently I have an "odd obsession" with my favorite twitch mod, but she just doesn't respect the mod that jail0r is.. I'd call her by her first name, jail0r (lol i know everything about her), but you guys probably didn't know her first name..
