[2022-12-14 01:11:03] <locoethan1220> I stoped playing genshin because I got to a point where it was pay to win or I was just super bad

[2022-12-14 01:11:28] <@%Grimstab77> Yeah it's BS
[2022-12-14 01:11:39] <!%Pepetchi> It's just pay to get the cool looking characters xD

[2022-12-14 01:13:00] <!%Pepetchi> True, they should really make co op better and more attractive
