I watched his stream for the first time yesterday (always just seen him in clips) and he spent roughly 50-60% of the stream on the ground and in the respawn room, and the other 40-50% giving bad food takes. Is that what all his streams are? Does he not do anything else but die or give bad food takes all day?]

[2023-01-03 12:19:24] <chillkroete85> the problem is with supporting in low elo is , that most ppls didn¬¥t use the heal they get so if they position bad or make bad decisons who they focus most supps stop healing them and heal instead ppl with impact . i had alot of games now where the supps not only carry with heal they carried with dmg 2

[2023-01-03 12:22:43] <%Goryllo> the thing is that we are talking about the POTENTIAL dps imo @iddqd in actual game situation you will rarely see that cause supports need to actually keep their team alive

[2023-01-03 12:54:50] <Auratara> doesn't positioning depend on your team? you could be properly positioning yourself based on situation but if your squad is derpy that could be the wrong play no?

[2023-01-03 14:30:07] <+taqzman1> plat but i picked diamond
[2023-01-03 14:30:11] <%+xUmby> seems gold or plat
[2023-01-03 14:30:15] <%iamboredlol1> Bronze
[2023-01-03 14:30:18] <justreef_> I think plat or gold now
[2023-01-03 14:30:19] <+Tsaku007> a tank picked ball, so it is diamond
[2023-01-03 14:30:19] <%MEGAsticky> silver
[2023-01-03 14:30:21] <Sycular> Gold-Plat but voting Diamond for the points ratio
[2023-01-03 14:30:25] <%+besparkedgirl> I feel like plat or diamond, and the first half they just hadn't warmed up
[2023-01-03 14:30:34] <justreef_> Plat is very generous.
[2023-01-03 14:30:34] <+taqzman1> @daisy82078 oh fuck we can wait till the end of the vod to vote? i wish i knew that before i voted
[2023-01-03 14:30:41] <%+Bioshocked> I believe the player is higher ranked than where they are currently at.
[2023-01-03 14:30:42] <%2kl2live2hot2die> plat or gold
[2023-01-03 14:30:44] <artboyo> all my points used NODDERS
[2023-01-03 14:30:50] <%MEGAsticky> mercy ignored so much during fights rules out plat+ for me

[2023-01-03 14:31:02] <%gemishtee> diamond stuck in plat
[2023-01-03 14:31:10] <introyvert> more damage boost, incorporate more super jump, other than that darn good mercy

[2023-01-03 14:33:05] <zeddidit> @iddqd  the mercy could do the hard spinimng  when rezzing makes it harder to hit her maybe too ?
[2023-01-03 14:33:06] <%Nubbinsss> considering how bap was i would say her healing was warranted
[2023-01-03 14:33:08] <CooperAttack> you cant damage boost if theyre dead
[2023-01-03 14:33:09] <%+TopLeftGuy> yes, overhealing and not enough damage boost
[2023-01-03 14:33:15] <Sycular> The lack of Damage Boost is what makes me go "Nah" but that points ratio chance Kreygasm

[2023-01-03 15:12:50] <%+GoLoseFast1> @taqzman1 makes sense when you look at the current state of the game

[2023-01-03 15:13:30] <+taqzman1> @taqzman1 yeah but maybe thats why the devs ignored him. they only want ass lickers to be next to them they want yes men

[2023-01-03 15:17:43] <+taqzman1> they will release PVE and major changes when the game dies. thats how they pull people back in. thats how they did it. made ow2 to pull old players back in even though pve was promised 6 years ago @iddqd

[2023-01-03 15:18:03] <%VikingJackAU> @iddqd I'm being cautiously optimistic that the current Lead Balance Designer can do a good job, (at least compared to the team in the past) he did a great job of improving Hearthstone after it had a rough patch, I assume that's why they hired him for a FPS game KEKW
