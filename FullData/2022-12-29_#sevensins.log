[2022-12-29 09:56:12] <Flashspitz> the newest lego star wars was fantastic
[2022-12-29 09:56:28] <Flashspitz> it had a lot of inside jokes about the movies, that kids totally wouldnt get
[2022-12-29 09:56:40] <%Lonefellow> I only played Lego Harry Potter and it was neat. Nice game to play with a partner or someone who isn't into gaming usually
[2022-12-29 09:56:46] <%Aurien__> anyone who doesn't enjoy them probably hasn't played them or takes themselves too seriously

[2022-12-29 12:48:57] <%crfed> Well of course they provide the product available for lower end quality like mobile devices and such, but the visual and sound engineers never intended to put so much blood sweat tears and hours away from their family for the final product to be experienced on a 9 inch stereo sub par experience. Whatever the distributor decides to make extra money does not justify the fact that it’s still a watered down experience on mobile / smaller device product
[2022-12-29 12:49:56] <%EarsMorgan> 1 person on mobile is better than 0 people

[2022-12-29 12:51:04] <%crfed> Oh dude I LOVE your steam quality. Hence why I watch it on my 4K Apple TV native twitch app. I have an amazing iPad Pro and an amazing desktop, as well as an iPhone 14 pro, but I’d NEVER watch it anything other on the best available
[2022-12-29 12:51:55] <%EarsMorgan> 7tv compressor for the win
[2022-12-29 12:51:56] <%ChuckVanGhost> Also iphone has a weird setup for subscribing.  Can't even use prime.
[2022-12-29 12:51:58] <%$RaptorGesus> as someone who works 5 days a week, 12 hours a day sitting in a car, mobile is a godsend

[2022-12-29 12:52:30] <%quovad15> still have a good audio setup (Vinyl enthusiast) and watch twitch streams on tv via avr system on my two way stereo loudspeakers. So your quality is appreciated here. Also the reason, why i have to write separatly  on my laptop if i want to use chat.
[2022-12-29 12:52:41] <%quovad15> so i do get the mobile advantages
[2022-12-29 12:53:09] <+HotMochaEX> Seven stream in the background from my phone while feeding my baby is better than no seven!
[2022-12-29 12:53:09] <%ChuckVanGhost> I dunno if anyone learns broadcast, but when I was a young pup learning broadcast, I was taught to monitor on a POS because that's where people will watch.  No point making it look good on a $5k PVM.

[2022-12-29 12:54:38] <%crfed> Your mic setup level / game level audio balance is rock solid. So many streamers struggle with that
[2022-12-29 12:55:18] <%ChuckVanGhost> Most of the struggle is not having an interface and trying to mix in windows and/or OBS.  lol
[2022-12-29 12:56:09] <%crfed> But I can tell you from experience the levels are far better experienced on an actual tv setup than on my desktop or mobile devices.

[2022-12-29 12:56:49] <%crfed> No comparison. The tv estuvo with its audio computing can’t compare especially if you have speakers on it

[2022-12-29 13:53:26] <%+Xelf> the trick with tacos is to take  the soft shell... but then crush the hardshells and add it to the softshells!

[2022-12-29 13:54:49] <%crfed> I don’t own a ps5. So are they all ntsc nowadays!?
[2022-12-29 13:54:56] <%tcmatthews_jr> really switchmode power supplies and LCD screens
[2022-12-29 13:55:20] <%Selnica> no, but regional lockouts are only inplace to maintain price differences between regions
[2022-12-29 13:55:32] <%crfed> So universal mean they run which format though??
[2022-12-29 13:55:33] <%Selnica> there is not compatibility issues at the technical level
[2022-12-29 13:55:35] <divinepun> ntsc?
[2022-12-29 13:55:41] <%Selnica> **no
[2022-12-29 13:56:03] <%quovad15> that means they run on all consoles on all tvs
[2022-12-29 13:56:15] <%XyFreak> ps5 supports a whole range of output "formats"
[2022-12-29 13:56:23] <divinepun> ah
[2022-12-29 13:56:24] <%XyFreak> the games are usually 60fps though
[2022-12-29 13:56:30] <%XyFreak> (or 30)
[2022-12-29 13:56:43] VIEWERS: 471
[2022-12-29 13:56:56] <%crfed> So they can “emulate” both formats. If that’s the case, good
[2022-12-29 13:57:06] <%XyFreak> ...didn't they introduce a 40fps mode as well?
[2022-12-29 13:57:17] <%XyFreak> no they can't
[2022-12-29 13:57:22] <%XyFreak> NTSC and PAL are long dead
[2022-12-29 13:57:30] <%XyFreak> it's something new
[2022-12-29 13:57:33] <%XyFreak> "new"
[2022-12-29 13:57:39] <%crfed> Formats and frames per second go hand in hand, her still a separate matter
[2022-12-29 13:57:50] <%Selnica> no
[2022-12-29 13:57:54] <%XyFreak> your usual formats are 720p60 1080p60 or 4k60
[2022-12-29 13:57:57] <divinepun> ded
[2022-12-29 13:58:02] <%quovad15> NTSC was a format, as was PAL or  SECAM
[2022-12-29 13:58:30] <%XyFreak> NTSC was color space + resolution + framerate
[2022-12-29 13:58:35] <%XyFreak> as was PAL
[2022-12-29 13:58:43] VIEWERS: 471
[2022-12-29 13:58:44] <%Selnica> NTSC and PAL had specific framerates, that differed but you don't have to be NTSC or PAL to have a framerate.
[2022-12-29 13:59:26] <%XyFreak> also ps5 has 120fps games as well
[2022-12-29 13:59:30] <%XyFreak> iirc
[2022-12-29 13:59:40] <@%XyPara> Don't it is it does one MrDestructoid
[2022-12-29 13:59:58] <%XyFreak> dunno if VRR is out of beta yet on ps5.... is it?

[2022-12-29 14:00:32] <%crfed> Well that’s arguable. There’s a reason why OF speed runners play OG FF on NTSC compared to PAL versions to save time

[2022-12-29 14:01:25] <%XyFreak> correct twitchtemplar
[2022-12-29 14:01:44] <%Selnica> askign if a game is running NTSC or PAL or JP, is liek askig if the new bluray disc is a 33, 45, or 78 size. (and yes I just dated myself here, witht he vynil records reference)
[2022-12-29 14:01:58] <%TwitchTemplar> Maybe that was relevant for crt TV:s but guess it's just not a thing anymore

[2022-12-29 14:05:37] <%+Kinitawowi> @crfed i heard pro smash players still use them because there's no lag
[2022-12-29 14:06:05] <%crfed> Yep, input/computing lag is still a deal
[2022-12-29 14:06:39] <%quovad15> @crfed I think it's the lines as well. the picture is more wellrounded
[2022-12-29 14:06:46] VIEWERS: 479
[2022-12-29 14:07:20] <%+Kinitawowi> the first guitar hero game has no lag calibration so it's basically unplayable on most modern tvs
[2022-12-29 14:07:53] <%quovad15> i have a framemeister as well for my retro on the big screen. but the lines just don't look as natural
[2022-12-29 14:07:56] <+SoSDiablo> I wonder if as time goes on companies will make lighter-weight CRTs for nostalgia purposes
[2022-12-29 14:08:15] <%crfed> Most crt monitors still in production for the most part are unfortunately marketed for the pro tele comunicación indistry. Because they can’t afford shit delay. So what was once cheap consumer standard is now a commodity unless you find an old model in good working condition

[2022-12-29 14:11:17] <%crfed> I’ve played many a games on the switch platform. It’s a crippled console that drops frames due to its mobile nature. EA sports and several other production houses had to create unique versions of their games for the switch due to the hardware shortcomings

[2022-12-29 14:14:37] <%Vdc2012> wasnt it a remastered?

[2022-12-29 14:15:02] <%quovad15> oh well, the went for quality more so than quantity. They were never the ones to beg for third parties then (N64 or GCN times) which made them lose good connections with other studios
[2022-12-29 14:15:39] <%TwitchTemplar> Ancient by now I think
[2022-12-29 14:15:49] <%quovad15> and today they are still more into gimmicks. But i am still a sucker for them

[2022-12-29 14:17:05] <blakey95uk> when they say ff9 remake, do they mean a remaster?
[2022-12-29 14:17:25] <%+Vinitus> ff9 really don't need a remake FF8 instead does
[2022-12-29 14:17:41] <%+M000GLE> They mean like FF7 remake
[2022-12-29 14:17:44] <fenrir000> or the anime?
[2022-12-29 14:17:57] <FakiAvdic> Apparently it's a remake, some leaks making it out to be more "Chibi" in style
[2022-12-29 14:17:59] <%frog_89_> so more like a sequal
[2022-12-29 14:17:59] <blakey95uk> ff9 is perfect, should be left alone lol
[2022-12-29 14:18:19] <%quovad15> i think it will be something like "Cooking with Quina" or "Learn Magic with Vivis Offspring"
[2022-12-29 14:18:32] <%+Kinitawowi> there are definitely things they can do to expand 9 in a remake :)
[2022-12-29 14:18:35] <%frog_89_> i never get that perspective "should be left alone" lol the original is not going anywhere if there comes a remake

[2022-12-29 14:20:10] <%crfed> A remaster is when they reproduce the exact same game with upgraded graphics and audio. A remake is when they fuck up a masterpiece, change plot lines and include nomura ghosts like in ff7 remake. I Have spoken

[2022-12-29 16:34:24] <%MasterVGuides> Yeah, I saw someone do Weak Mode and did everything in the game, including Trial Mode.
[2022-12-29 16:34:28] <Iremicus> red mage/archer would be amazing for sure
[2022-12-29 16:34:34] <%+JaymieGamer> wont need to do that, how about red mage verses battlemage?
[2022-12-29 16:34:59] <%MasterVGuides> Red Mage/Archer is a great combo, for sure.

[2022-12-29 16:35:49] <%Neobullseye> Come to think of it... Aside from Crystalbugs, are there any screens where there are enemies on the same screen as Save Crystals?

[2022-12-29 16:36:58] <%Neobullseye> Diamond Armlets completely change the loot table. You don't want to wear it *all* the time.
[2022-12-29 16:37:15] <%Neobullseye> It's not like other games where you just get a better chance of the rarer stuff.

[2022-12-29 16:40:18] <%Neobullseye> In between six characters, that gives just enough combinations yo make everyone have two Jobs and still all have a different combination.

[2022-12-29 16:59:56] <+RayMagnus> finding Montblanc on Tactics after playing XII was amazing
[2022-12-29 17:00:00] <+CrasH_CTB> never played 11 but 14 deserves its numbered main game place. Even more since you can basically play it as a single player game anyway.
[2022-12-29 17:00:22] <%+Yimoa> @asherosiris how is it confusing exactly
[2022-12-29 17:00:24] <%Neobullseye> And all of them as close to 100% as can be reasonably achieved without being pedantic about it.
[2022-12-29 17:00:34] <%+JaymieGamer> I mean final fantasy 11 you can get it on the PlayStation 2 but you had to hook up the internet cord to it to be able to play online and you had to subscribe to the game to play monthly online and then you got PC users that played it
[2022-12-29 17:00:56] <%+asherosiris> @Yimoa well someone could be talking about the series and someone that doesnt know could just be like "why did you skip blah blah" just simple things
[2022-12-29 17:01:16] <%+Reinhoc> weird discussion, huh?
[2022-12-29 17:01:23] <%+JaymieGamer> I mean I never played 11 but I had my uncle that played 11 he put in 3 hours 300 hours
[2022-12-29 17:01:25] <%AngaPeeters> next subject?
[2022-12-29 17:01:30] <%frog_89_> a private server for 11 just opened like 2 weeks ago has a nice population
[2022-12-29 17:01:31] <%+ReimHikari> XI and XIV are online titles ye but story can be played as single player
[2022-12-29 17:01:34] <%+ReimHikari> and is so nice
[2022-12-29 17:01:36] <!%hologrammer> 🍷 bggBaka
[2022-12-29 17:01:43] <%+ReimHikari> every FF is a great experience as a summary
[2022-12-29 17:01:44] VIEWERS: 534
[2022-12-29 17:01:48] <%+JaymieGamer> he played final fantasy 11 for over 300 hours and not even halfway done with it
[2022-12-29 17:01:50] <@%RabidAmoeba> sevenSip
[2022-12-29 17:01:51] <%Neobullseye> For example, in FF8 I feel that killing all bosses, getting all GFs and getting all cards counts as 100% completion. I don't really think you need 100 copies of all items; that's Perfect Game territory.
[2022-12-29 17:01:51] <%+Reinhoc> Wendy!!! shouHi

[2022-12-29 17:02:30] <%Yaeger136> There better be a damn good party at the top then
[2022-12-29 17:02:39] <%+JaymieGamer> in final fantasy 8 I have done a no level run where guardian forces never leveled and my characters never leveled
[2022-12-29 17:02:44] <%+asherosiris> all of the others besides those two are party based single played in the numbered series though no?
[2022-12-29 17:02:47] <!%hologrammer> 65 bottles of wine on the wall, 65 bottles of wine! Take one down, pass it around, 64 bottles of wine on the wall

[2022-12-29 17:03:23] <%$ReiwaMagi> I haven't gotten sick since the summer time
[2022-12-29 17:03:23] <%+Yimoa> @asherosiris before my hiatus I had 9 years and 70k hours in the game, some folks never considered an online service game or MMO as viable criteria for people to play
[2022-12-29 17:03:24] <%Selnica> WHY WOULD YOU SAY THAT!!! bggD
[2022-12-29 17:03:25] <%+JaymieGamer> @asherosiris
[2022-12-29 17:03:25] <%$Toooonsicle> I have been sick 4 times this month alone
[2022-12-29 17:03:25] <%$ReiwaMagi> when I got COVID
[2022-12-29 17:03:37] <+Queenofb00tie510> I'm currently on a vacation /staycation... and one of the little people here got me sick 😷
[2022-12-29 17:03:40] <%+JaymieGamer> @asherosiris that's how I did my no level run with the 100% run was the card run so I can get magic
[2022-12-29 17:03:43] <%Neobullseye> Aaand I'm off again.
