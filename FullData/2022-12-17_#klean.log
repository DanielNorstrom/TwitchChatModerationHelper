[2022-12-17 00:11:02] <Dookha_> is this play test feeling slower clunckier than previous ones, just feels weirdly off
[2022-12-17 00:11:07] <%+d3rpdarp> @snicklefritzthagawd I honestly don't have a problem with going slow, but the circle/playing solo just makes it pretty rough.
[2022-12-17 00:11:15] <dankmemes4u> the struggle is real
[2022-12-17 00:11:38] <Dookha_> yeh the fluid fun has gone
[2022-12-17 00:11:45] <%+d3rpdarp> animation locks do be the worst.
[2022-12-17 00:11:59] <snicklefritzthagawd> @d3rpdarp oh yeah none of these games are really built for solo idt... no balancing as far as i know
[2022-12-17 00:12:06] <+biohazard_0217> Is this just a play test? If so when does it end?

[2022-12-17 00:32:24] <+Sneaky_Breeky1337> @oni_pepega no actually i havent got around to picking it up but have watched alot of it, im really picky and for some reason I dont like the way the physics look and no ragdolls.
[2022-12-17 00:32:44] <+Sneaky_Breeky1337> @oni_pepega but i can understand the comparison, does this have pvp in it though? havent watched much yet
[2022-12-17 00:33:27] <oni_pepega> @Sneaky_Breeky1337 I feel you, so in Hunt you face multiple people as solo, the same is in this game
[2022-12-17 00:33:41] <oni_pepega> @Sneaky_Breeky1337 as solo you can encounter 2 or 3 mans
[2022-12-17 00:33:54] <CerealKillerDude> in hunt you can outmaneuvre them
[2022-12-17 00:34:00] <CerealKillerDude> here you're stuck in dungeons

[2022-12-17 01:19:14] <+Pibbs__> them slowing down the loot is fine theres just a max of 3-4 blue portals that spawn in the first area so it forces you to go down more
[2022-12-17 01:19:36] <+Pibbs__> which im assuming is cause they are trying to test how pvp plays out in the down area more
[2022-12-17 01:19:55] <+Pibbs__> so they are trying to force people down there more this test

[2022-12-17 02:28:32] <Doctor_Gonzo_7> i truly think the removal of 3 man portals was not done right, as in: they should have gave us more blue single portals as a compensation. right now there is so many times where u just have to let your teammate die cuz there is no portals left
[2022-12-17 02:28:44] <avaris_gr> @Absail so you get to progress after "raids"?

[2022-12-17 02:30:28] <%ColeChiIls> @Doctor_Gonzo_7 ^ so the lack of blue portals might be a team balancing thing, as well as loot sink

[2022-12-17 02:32:56] <Doctor_Gonzo_7> @Yfa7 ofcourse you try for a red one if you have no other choice, but they also drastically increased difficulty on the next map, so the survivability down there is even worse then it was before. and keep in mind your team is split up at this point, some of your team has probably found a blue portal, so you dont have a full team anymore
[2022-12-17 02:34:08] <mogel78> What’s up Klean
[2022-12-17 02:34:35] <Doctor_Gonzo_7> @ColeChiIls yes it definitely is a loot sink, but for the player experience this obviously is not "fun" no-one likes losing your loot just because you can't find a portal. and yea it definitely is a bigger issue for squads then solos, that is definitely true

[2022-12-17 03:39:45] <MoreAciD> @Klean was in hutch's stream heard you been playing MO2, i personally just bought the game yesterday, watched the devs most recent vods on twitch and he was mentioning subscriptions are coming when the game launches to the epic games launcher. personally im refunding it, i believe a game that isnt F2P should not require a sub to play.. youve already payed for the game.. what are your thoughts?
[2022-12-17 03:40:06] <+DigDu6> Mo2 is hot garbage

[2022-12-17 23:36:52] <%ForsaikenRedskye> Star Citizen is different in terms of theme... Star Citizen is like a Modern take of space games really. it's all fantasy except for the alien ships that were from Wing Commander in the past. that's about it kleanSmokin

[2022-12-17 23:42:04] <+sedg3> @bobsyouruncle469 scheduled patch downtime, back up in ~1 hour according to DnD discord
[2022-12-17 23:42:05] <+Sugabuga87> DnD is updating and we'll be back up in like an hour it says
[2022-12-17 23:42:23] <+sedg3> shame, just found a good 3made

[2022-12-17 23:46:08] <DookieStyleX> what happened to dark and darker ?
[2022-12-17 23:46:24] <p4nnus> read the title
[2022-12-17 23:46:40] <Rigben> if you make a bridge with a lever connected you can make a garbage smasher. put a garbage zone under the bridge and lower it to delete objects. that would allow you do delete all those items in the field.

[2022-12-17 23:47:22] <Rigben> ya, any bridge with ground under it
[2022-12-17 23:47:50] <$JopoKing22> DARK AND DARKER IS PATCHING

[2022-12-17 23:49:36] <itsTomsGG> did they post something about the downtime?
[2022-12-17 23:50:19] <+LenabonTV> I forgot about the body wall LUL
[2022-12-17 23:50:41] <qbixrube> the bodies also fuck with your FPS, fyi
[2022-12-17 23:50:43] VIEWERS: 1 079
[2022-12-17 23:50:44] <+LenabonTV> they dont mind the skeletons?
[2022-12-17 23:50:46] <%RollerMobbed> the bodies are apart of the framerate issues though, because its a lot of shit decaying
[2022-12-17 23:51:35] <%RollerMobbed> there will be more corpses to come anyways
[2022-12-17 23:51:53] <+monkeyfishfrog69420> Is it an optimization issue?
[2022-12-17 23:52:01] <+sedg3> @itsTomsGG in dnd discord
[2022-12-17 23:52:35] <+Sugabuga87> does this game have a tutorial or you have to figure it all out on your own?
[2022-12-17 23:52:36] <coldfrenchfries> fort looking clean
[2022-12-17 23:52:42] <%RollerMobbed> @monkeyfishfrog69420 yes and no, its just a lot of processing that the game has to do for all its simulation. Just typical DF stuff

[2022-12-17 23:53:03] <+LenabonTV> bro I have to cap my pop, I cant do it lol
[2022-12-17 23:53:05] <Bonniies> whats going on here? what am i seeing happen
[2022-12-17 23:53:10] <+LenabonTV> its too much going on for me
[2022-12-17 23:53:38] <Jaspyre> yes
[2022-12-17 23:53:40] <Bonniies> are they building?
[2022-12-17 23:53:40] <%RollerMobbed> @klean I would make the garbage smasher elsewhere for that reason
[2022-12-17 23:53:40] <qbixrube> yeah
[2022-12-17 23:53:48] <%+Gamms90> This game would be so difficult for me to get into. I think I’m a picture book of gamer
[2022-12-17 23:54:24] <+sedg3> Klean said he's put like 60h so far to learn this much
[2022-12-17 23:54:28] <qbixrube> I usually have a minecart which takes from my refuse pile, then dumps into a pit with a smasher in it

[2022-12-17 23:54:53] <qbixrube> that way you can automate dumping certain items without having to manually select each one to be dumped
[2022-12-17 23:55:30] <%ItsRender> Damn 20 FPS. I was getting around 9 FPS LUL at this size of a base. Im now created a new base to try and optimize pathing, also cut down on livestock
[2022-12-17 23:55:44] <%ItsRender> sadly this game doesn't use your GPU
[2022-12-17 23:56:07] <%ItsRender> and uses only 1 core on your CPU apparently LUL
[2022-12-17 23:56:14] <%RollerMobbed> yes it does
[2022-12-17 23:56:28] <%RollerMobbed> You can literally use a single tile

[2022-12-17 23:56:58] <%ItsRender> I thought Tarn said his end goal was to have 10,000 people stable in one city (at least for adventure mode)
[2022-12-17 23:57:23] <%KlngofGods> 10k people monkaS
[2022-12-17 23:57:54] <%MagicMeech> im at 14 pop rn
[2022-12-17 23:58:23] <%MagicMeech> and i cant figure out how to make alchohol
[2022-12-17 23:58:25] <%ItsRender> You can try to put into steam launch settings -high ... That'll allow the CPU to set it to high priority when it launches

[2022-12-17 23:59:43] <RL07_> Hey guys, new player here. What are the best weapon types to make ? Just found some adamantine and I can make some weapons, just don't know which ones to choose from
[2022-12-17 23:59:58] <%RollerMobbed> @MagicMeech You need to craft barrels too at the carpenters
