[2023-01-05 19:04:14] <iAm_Quarry> I can't believe how toxic Spear Shot is in League of Legends! Every time I watch his stream, he's berating his teammates and calling them all sorts of names. It's so unpleasant to watch and it's clear that he doesn't care about anyone else's feelings. I don't know how anyone can stand to play with him. Stay far away from this streamer, folks...

[2023-01-05 19:05:06] <%Keegunlol> you made the right call to stay top pushing, they should have just gave drag while ww roams he gets even furthur behind against you. its just 1st drag for ur team or 2nd for them literally not game changing and just regroup to contest 3rd while you get yourself more ahead.

He's like the queen bee of toxicity. But hey, at least the chat is never boring when he's around. Keep doing you, Spear Shot! #ToxicKing
