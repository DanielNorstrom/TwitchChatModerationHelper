[2022-12-08 14:49:03] <SimonSez> Another streamer that has 5k+ hours in DF equates it to learning to drive a new car where all the levers you are used to are in another place
[2022-12-08 14:49:45] <%tatertot18> so now we just need aurora 4x steam release?

[2022-12-08 14:50:41] <+CosmicKingEvol> I love the new steam version. I am actually able to play DF and learn it.But I do hope that for the old players, they add a lot of legacy options or something. Knowing the devs, I am sure things will work out. It will take time.
[2022-12-08 14:51:14] <+ElTankoJoe> Next update will probably have legacy control options etc.

[2022-12-08 14:52:48] <+Belios4> And if I remember right, a good part of the UI modification are planned to be added to the free version but I am not sure
[2022-12-08 14:53:10] <Maiden116> i think this is a really good step on the right way for DF , but they need to improve a bit too much on UI
[2022-12-08 14:53:20] <%+bh3x> to get mouse controls to classic you need dfhack

[2022-12-08 15:07:11] <wombat_medik> From my understanding is that the shells cannot be binned or barreled (Stacked)

[2022-12-08 15:15:35] <%JohnDoeRadio> at first it was hella confusing

[2022-12-08 15:21:38] <%KingPigeonKP> whatsup king dwarf
[2022-12-08 15:21:42] <+ElTankoJoe> The game is simulating the political climate on the other side of the world right now.
[2022-12-08 15:21:44] <@%$Everleigh> It's the best selling game on Steam right now....
[2022-12-08 15:21:46] <KWAiRT> Even the font is nostalgic

[2022-12-08 15:21:48] <%JohnDoeRadio> the literal skyscraper building in this game is worth the money alone imo.
[2022-12-08 15:21:48] <SimonSez> DF Premium is described as the tileset and the music. That's what you get with the Steam version. DF Classic will also get this UI at some point. The dev has said that he does not want to maintain two codebases (A free version and a Steam version)
[2022-12-08 15:21:55] <+chosen_silver> I've never played this kind of genre before so just a bit shy on the investment

[2022-12-08 15:23:41] <GarionTheFirstOfHisName> @chosen_silver rimworld will be easier to get into, if you are new to the genre.  and its a great investment $/time wise

[2022-12-08 15:24:48] <%SkyShadowing> you could retire the fortress and adventure to it and talk to your people.
[2022-12-08 15:24:54] <%JohnDoeRadio> they said youll be able to adventure in your world like cringer is playing in now.  he can go back and raid this spot

[2022-12-08 15:25:43] <+ElTankoJoe> @oxykottin burning all the trees on the map to fire my brick kilns isn't very elf-like

[2022-12-08 15:26:36] <%+bh3x> no crossing seas currently, you could potentially start forts and build bridge across though
[2022-12-08 15:26:56] <%JohnDoeRadio> oh man ive never seen that

[2022-12-08 15:27:35] <%$darkdagger22> you can change your embark size and build your own bridge if it is short enough
[2022-12-08 15:27:54] <%+bh3x> you can try reclaim forts

[2022-12-08 15:48:40] <$eisenh0rn40> I’m just listening whilst doing some chores. This game/comments are hilarious. Especially without context. ‘I think his bones are still upstairs’
[2022-12-08 15:49:05] <%JohnDoeRadio> its funny the children are the ones who generally recover bodies lol
[2022-12-08 15:49:20] <Sax850> i really really like the gem sprites in this version and im someone whos a diehard ascii player in the original.
[2022-12-08 15:49:29] <%RageLion91> when did Dwarf Fortress get a graphic overhaul?
[2022-12-08 15:49:38] <Sax850> it came with the steam release @RageLion91
[2022-12-08 15:49:55] <%RageLion91> SeemsGood
[2022-12-08 15:50:00] <%JohnDoeRadio> @Sax850 the amount of ore and rock is staggering
[2022-12-08 15:50:06] VIEWERS: 673
[2022-12-08 15:50:21] <%+AaronK21214> Is it on GForce Now?  I don't think my rig can handle these graphics.

[2022-12-08 15:50:26] <andicartin> what's your favorite thing this game has?
[2022-12-08 15:50:30] <wolator> are there any goals in this game like rimworld?
[2022-12-08 15:50:35] <@%$Asiak> @AaronK21214 Not yet I don't think so
[2022-12-08 15:50:42] <%JohnDoeRadio> they are exploring that
[2022-12-08 15:51:04] <SimonSez> Win conditions are for quitters :p
[2022-12-08 15:51:13] <Sax850> yeah, for me its easier to identify the rock and ores in ascii than the steam graphics so far @JohnDoeRadio but thats just how used i am with ascii. However the gems graphics as said is very nice.
[2022-12-08 15:51:26] <+deepseamastodon> They said they are working to eventually get DF to geforce now
[2022-12-08 15:51:36] <%JohnDoeRadio> yeah i can see how symbols would be far easier
[2022-12-08 15:51:50] <Sax850> its just so ingrained in my brain, the colors and everything :V
[2022-12-08 15:51:55] <%+jovianmoon> It's a Lore generator with some gameplay mechanics.

[2022-12-08 15:54:13] <Sax850> My only really major gripe with the steam release for me is no dedicated screen or button for Alerts/Announcements/Reports - its all by those popup things and I can't have a log of events that I can go back to if I accidentally dismiss an alert or so.
[2022-12-08 15:54:27] <stretch_marx> the turtle problem hits everyone hard
[2022-12-08 15:54:33] <%JohnDoeRadio> yeah the ui and alerts are the most complained about by far
[2022-12-08 15:54:45] <+slomaxgaming> what are you making with the shells?
[2022-12-08 15:54:57] <%JohnDoeRadio> i find everything in the alerts way too late
[2022-12-08 15:54:58] <%LotheronPrime> There's a mod for alert sounds now at least
[2022-12-08 15:55:06] <%JohnDoeRadio> i got that its not the best either
[2022-12-08 15:55:27] <stretch_marx> he's very stocky
[2022-12-08 15:55:29] <Sax850> I don't mind the UI being clunky at all, consideirng where I am - its just I want to be able to read past events and past combat reports in my leasure without being worried of losing that history forever if i dismiss it.
[2022-12-08 15:55:36] <Talyus_Gohrann> at least it's not a ManBearPig

[2022-12-08 16:22:43] <PatchyMaster> @friesengeist they have chests in their rooms

[2022-12-08 16:24:16] <PatchyMaster> @friesengeist yes, I think what is happening is they go on duty and grab the backpack and food, then the food belongs to them, then when they go off duty they take off the backpack but still have the food, which belongs to hem now, so they take it to their room
[2022-12-08 16:24:40] <PatchyMaster> no idea what to do about it lol

[2022-12-08 16:34:07] <Nunnoh> unfortunately there no 1 fix to the UI issues because larger monitors need more scaling and smaller monitors need the other settings widened, maybe itll be optimized soonish
