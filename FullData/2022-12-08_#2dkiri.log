[2022-12-08 13:26:07] <%Drygyn> This is Dwarf Fortress - I am now pondering if you actually CAN build a bridge from dwarves.
[2022-12-08 13:26:17] <%ToddVO> So, build ceilings out of dwarves?
[2022-12-08 13:26:19] <$H2O4S> If you don't have soil underground, one thing one can do is make mud in an area.
[2022-12-08 13:26:37] <Stolperstein> @Drygyn Just stack them and push them over
[2022-12-08 13:27:21] <%Drygyn> @Drygyn Yeah, but they squirm and flop about and go off to pet cats and drink beer.

[2022-12-08 13:43:15] <crocodilusc> Hi, chat - can I ask your advice? I started playing DF and practically all my 20 dwarves have now been killed by birds like giant sparrow and others. I have no idea what I've done to piss them off and how to defend myself.

[2022-12-08 13:44:06] <%Lemons9Oz> theres also a sub menu if you click on the tavern where you can assign a tavern keeper and bards but you need to make instruments first before you assign one
[2022-12-08 13:44:10] <Stolperstein> @crocodilusc Cant you throw some hobbits to distract them? gbuttSip
[2022-12-08 13:44:13] <Termak> "giant" means actually giant, like house sized,  just go underground if in hostile territory
[2022-12-08 13:44:18] <+The_Dakta> @crocodilusc militaries can be hard as a beginner. My advice is to start a world with no enemies and low "evil" or whatever that option is. This will allow you to play around in relative safety to learn the ropes
[2022-12-08 13:44:19] <$H2O4S> @crocodilusc Keep them inside or make weapons and a military squad @crocodilusc
[2022-12-08 13:44:21] <+Rievan> @crocodilusc Some wildlife just doesn't like dwarves. You can embark somewhere calmer, or have more of a military, or build walls etc. War dogs tied on a rope are quite a good passive defense as well.
[2022-12-08 13:44:26] <%Drygyn> @crocodilusc Aggressive native creatures is always tough. Spend more time underground, or maybe a safer start location?
[2022-12-08 13:44:34] <%wombatwhole> storage does not require a d
[2022-12-08 13:44:42] <Termak> safety = dig deeper and stay there :D
[2022-12-08 13:44:44] <+The_Dakta> @crocodilusc +2 to staying underground. Rock and stone!
[2022-12-08 13:44:56] <crocodilusc> whow, thanks..
[2022-12-08 13:45:22] <Termak> sun is for treehuggers, rock and stone
[2022-12-08 13:45:32] <crocodilusc> Yeah, I know about the tutorials, but I thought I could kind of figure things out on my own, but it looks like it's not going to work for this game..
[2022-12-08 13:45:35] VIEWERS: 239
[2022-12-08 13:45:48] <fir3wolfhhmd> stay underground, find lava, cleanse the surface
[2022-12-08 13:46:11] <Termak> pump the lava above your entrance, and no one is going to bother you
[2022-12-08 13:46:17] <%Lemons9Oz> is it possible to craft floor rugs or different types of decor?
[2022-12-08 13:46:20] <+The_Dakta> @crocodilusc I've played off and on for the last 10+ years and have read a bunch of the wiki and I'm still playing the tutorial lmao
[2022-12-08 13:46:29] <+The_Dakta> @Lemons9Oz 99% positive yes
[2022-12-08 13:46:31] <$H2O4S> That would make for a super steep learning curve @crocodilusc :) I highly recommend having the DF wiki open.
[2022-12-08 13:46:38] <%$Reger464> peepoClap
[2022-12-08 13:46:53] <Termak> you can use all kinds of blocks to make floor, or smooth/engrave it
[2022-12-08 13:46:54] <%Lemons9Oz> @Lemons9Oz awesome!
[2022-12-08 13:47:03] <%+bh3x> now you can build a moat around your castle
[2022-12-08 13:47:09] <Termak> lead floors are very dwarfy
[2022-12-08 13:47:15] <crocodilusc> I think I'll turn off the enemies at least to start with...I think I'll still have a lot to learn.
[2022-12-08 13:47:22] <%Drygyn> You will want to leave that drawbridge open, so traders see available access. Close it when bad things come.
[2022-12-08 13:47:26] <+Rievan> Figuring it out for yourself is half the fun imo :) Just expect to lose a lot of fortresses before you succeed. That's why we say "Losing is Fun" :)
[2022-12-08 13:47:29] <+The_Dakta> for rugs though I think it's a more complicated process with weaving and dying and stuff

[2022-12-08 13:48:13] <+Rievan> a floor on the next level up yes
[2022-12-08 13:48:18] <Termak> floor above = roof
[2022-12-08 13:48:18] <+Rievan> there's no roof specific tile
[2022-12-08 13:48:20] <$H2O4S> @crocodilusc I played without enemies for a long time in the start @crocodilusc - The second I felt ready to turn them back on, a cyclops invaded!

[2022-12-08 13:48:34] <Termak> dorfs need to get up there
[2022-12-08 13:48:38] <%Drygyn> You need stairs to climb up there
[2022-12-08 13:48:40] <Termak> make stairs or so
[2022-12-08 13:48:47] <fir3wolfhhmd> the tutorials are like a pickaxe to tunnel through the cliff that is the DF learning curve
[2022-12-08 13:49:32] <Termak> combat descriptions are the best part of the game
[2022-12-08 13:49:35] <lostzoat> is the game fully playable by mouse now?

[2022-12-08 13:51:05] <+chaostrojan> sometimes I think you need a Phd  for this game at times

[2022-12-08 13:52:48] <+FraggleRock2> They can make books and scrolls! I think that does influence knowledge movement too.
[2022-12-08 13:52:53] <$H2O4S> @BillFerShort There aren't super many changes from the original afaik. So yeah
[2022-12-08 13:52:53] <Spe1der> Hi Kiri and chat. what is this game? it looks a bit like Rimworld.

[2022-12-08 14:21:47] <+ListlessOnion> Your complaint is absolutely valid @2DKiri , this version of DF is better than the previous (it had no info whatsoever) but there is still a lot to do

[2022-12-08 14:22:00] <%+yourfate> in strange moods they need to craft something form some specific material, or they go mad
[2022-12-08 14:22:03] <+ecksray19> like a Fey mood where they go all crazy and murderous? How does stored bone help with that?
[2022-12-08 14:22:14] <$H2O4S> They require different materials for strange moods Kiri. If they can't find them after a while they go bonkers.

[2022-12-08 14:22:33] <$H2O4S> @ecksray19 Exactly
[2022-12-08 14:22:35] <Io2696> when they go in a strange Mood they Will craft a legendary artifact IF they have the materials they want, otherwise they go crazy
[2022-12-08 14:22:50] <+ListlessOnion> And while it's true that Rimworld gives a lot of information, achieving the same level of detail here in DF would require a very very large amount of text...

[2022-12-08 14:24:09] <crewel_> I think I prefer Rimworld TBH, too much fiddling in DF IMO, I do like the variety of events and interactions that can occur though
[2022-12-08 14:24:24] <+Cyboracle> DF even tracks the internal temperature of each thing.
[2022-12-08 14:24:29] <CerelliTV> Variety is nice

[2022-12-08 14:24:31] <$H2O4S> @peltsari They are similar, but there are fundemental differences. Definitely
[2022-12-08 14:24:42] <+Rievan> DF definitely feels its age sometimes. It inspired so many other things, and those things didn't just clone but did their own cool stuff
[2022-12-08 14:24:42] <Termak> steam version has all the spy and vampire stuff with necromances and such ?
[2022-12-08 14:24:48] <+The_Dakta> for me, z levels is the biggest difference that wins me over
[2022-12-08 14:24:55] <+gewelia13> Yes thats the draw of dwarf fortress the depth of the sim, it also tracks muscles and bones and organs on all people and creatures
[2022-12-08 14:25:04] <+Rievan> Personally I prefer DF but I think they all have their benefits

[2022-12-08 14:29:47] <Termak> you can smoothe the walls and floors to make it nicer
[2022-12-08 14:29:51] <%Lemons9Oz> I think at the end of the day, each to their own, theres so many arguments on the steam forums about this game and its just plain stupid and immature how some people carry on

[2022-12-08 14:31:35] <+ListlessOnion> At the same time, the fact that 1 tile out of 10 isn't smooth isn't such a big deal. Long time DF players have their preferences I guess LUL

[2022-12-08 14:55:00] <benupde287> Eating raw helmets and brewing helmets makes plump helmet spawns. Cooking it destroys the seeds

[2022-12-08 14:55:07] <Termak> dorfs will grow so many plump helmets its not a problem to eat some too

[2022-12-08 15:25:28] <Solomanta> the dev was pretty adamant about not wanting the game to have graphics for a long time. i guess some publisher showed a check
[2022-12-08 15:25:44] <+Cyboracle> @Solomanta No, the dev needed money for medical bills.

[2022-12-08 15:26:57] <+Cyboracle> Yeah, to my knowledge that was why the devs decided to go for this release.

[2022-12-08 15:38:49] <%TimothyAdan> I played the original version for a very long time, and my reason for stopping was because I was sick of deciphering the matrix lol

[2022-12-08 15:39:44] <%+hi_im_meo> It does make me wonder what an acceptable scope to set is for an indie simulation game. Is it a design mistake for DF to have added graphics so late? Or is it actually a really good idea to put graphics last for all complex sim games and maybe Rimworld could've benefited from a pre-graphics ASCII launch
[2022-12-08 15:39:46] <Termak> tilesets make original almost same if not better than this, though the new one has mousedriven menus

[2022-12-08 15:41:15] <%squighopper4> also hello everyone! kiriHi
[2022-12-08 15:41:29] <Tigozawr> Steam doesn't allow the game to be early access if it's release date is "I dunno"
[2022-12-08 15:41:31] <+Heathenist> The last couple decades is when most of the work gets done
[2022-12-08 15:41:36] <%+yourfate> you can turn some of the old bedrooms into offices maybe
[2022-12-08 15:41:40] <%$DamagedCarbine> @squighopper4 DF is never completed. I would say there are times where you are done.

[2022-12-08 15:41:57] <Halceon> Steam's Early Access implies a state of being done. On the one hand, DF is like 80% through the big design doc, on the other hand, it's got tons of stuff that was never in the doc. It's a forever project in that sense.

[2022-12-08 15:42:38] <%+hi_im_meo> yeah, thats fair. I'm starting to build a 2d sim game, performance has always been the #1 issue, it's tempting to cut at graphics in an effort to ensure the core game mechanics are solid, but sometimes the magic is from all the art pieces working together supporting some basic mechanics
[2022-12-08 15:43:06] <%+ecksray19> @tigozawr are you sure? Baldur's Gate 3 has been in early access for years now
[2022-12-08 15:43:38] <Tigozawr> @ecksray19 The proposed release date can be pushed forward indefinitely, but it must be a certain number at any given time

[2022-12-08 15:44:10] <+ListlessOnion> The Adams didn't cut on graphics because of performance really. It was more a question of "how do you spend your time" they couldn't hire an artist for decades...
[2022-12-08 15:44:13] <Tigozawr> @2DKiri If you are not afraid of job cancellations, you can just put 0 in the amount in manager and the order amount becomes infinite
[2022-12-08 15:44:18] <benupde287> The answer is to figure out how to batch your ticks, so that you can multithread your simulation.
[2022-12-08 15:44:24] <%+hi_im_meo> @ListlessOnion oh interesting
[2022-12-08 15:44:34] <benupde287> Because single thread simulation will always chig

[2022-12-08 15:46:31] <Nyquist441> be careful with infinite orders, you can burn through mats and overflow stockpiles and workshops, better to set conditions
[2022-12-08 15:46:39] <benupde287> Right. If you change that to zero, behavior is keep doing it
[2022-12-08 15:46:43] <Tigozawr> Nope. If it's zero they make it until you remove the order
[2022-12-08 15:46:44] <%+Thrawn200> Yes, if it's 0 they just craft it forever.
[2022-12-08 15:46:55] <+happyhippie924> Yeah the 0 order thing to make it infinite seems scary and dangerous
[2022-12-08 15:46:57] <MrFaber81> infinite orders are usually a bad idea tbh
[2022-12-08 15:47:13] <Halceon> Nah, drawbridge beats door. I.e., a bridge can destroy a door, but a door can't destroy a bridge.
[2022-12-08 15:47:34] <@%2DKiriBot> Remember to clip funny moments. They go into clip compilations for YT kiriCool
[2022-12-08 15:47:34] <Halceon> I say that, but now I'm thinking a mincart-shotgunned door might break a bridge.

[2022-12-08 15:51:29] <Halceon> Ok, the instruments thing. What you have are probably handheld instruments. To use them you need to put a chest in a tavern or temple. And then people will use them to play music when appropriate.

[2022-12-08 16:20:58] <Starlocke> the ones over pits... might let fliers and jumpers through.

[2022-12-08 16:21:58] <%+yourfate> making your fortress too valuable with statues, engravings etc before you have military and traps can be a bad idea

[2022-12-08 16:23:29] <+Draaven> You need a pasture and put your animals in it
[2022-12-08 16:23:29] <+Cyboracle> not the horse!
[2022-12-08 16:23:39] <Starlocke> i think the hors ran up a tree.
[2022-12-08 16:23:41] <+Draaven> oh you had  a pasture
[2022-12-08 16:23:41] <%TimothyAdan> The horse climbed the tree and starvedd! lol
[2022-12-08 16:23:45] <DrHermelin> maybe it's a wild dead horse?
[2022-12-08 16:23:46] <%$DamagedCarbine> Looks like the horse was put out to pasture.

[2022-12-08 16:24:18] <Termak> tree grew under it and pushed it up to the branches
[2022-12-08 16:24:25] <benupde287> Bit coal is raw coal, use the furnace to process into coke, which is fuel for the forge and the furnace
[2022-12-08 16:24:26] <Starlocke> units randomly climb up trees and can't ever get back down.

[2022-12-08 16:25:41] <Hanknasty1> knowing dwarf fortress. that is possible
[2022-12-08 16:26:00] <Starlocke> it should probably go into the wiki as a myth/legend :P

[2022-12-08 16:26:51] <+Draaven> Dwarf Fortress is full of surprises
[2022-12-08 16:26:58] <Hanknasty1> Drherm RimWorld was heavily inspired by dwarf fortress. so that's understandable
[2022-12-08 16:27:09] <+JTBossHogg> dismantle the wagon
[2022-12-08 16:27:12] <KillMolly> Also possible, something scared the horse, horse ran up, and staved to death
[2022-12-08 16:27:18] <+Adanos_ger> gotta love the stories this kind of games tell
[2022-12-08 16:27:20] <Valentin_PV> people never look up irl too, checks out
[2022-12-08 16:27:20] <Inglonias> Because if you're too warm and take off clothing to compensate, eventually people say "wow, you look terrible" and "put pants on before I call the police". Winter doesn't have that problem. Also, lrrHERE
[2022-12-08 16:27:23] <ezrandir> What good is looking up? The sky is not made of stone
[2022-12-08 16:27:28] <+Cyboracle> DF is OG
[2022-12-08 16:27:29] <benupde287> If one of your horses went missing, would you start looking up?!
[2022-12-08 16:28:01] <Valentin_PV> oh snap, a horse went missing, everyone, we must check the trees!
[2022-12-08 16:28:06] <%$Elikabu> how to prevent that: cut the trees in the pasture
[2022-12-08 16:28:12] <Hanknasty1> Not only is DF the OG. it has been the longest in development. and weaves way deeper stories. and development won't stop until tarn Adams dies physically

[2022-12-08 16:28:49] <%$DamagedCarbine> @Loketta beat me too it
[2022-12-08 16:28:54] <snorrewb> maybe the horse planned this all along
[2022-12-08 16:29:10] <KillMolly> @2DKiri Ah, dwarves can go missing for weeks before someone discovers their dead body lol
[2022-12-08 16:29:12] <DrHermelin> dies this version feature sound of "pawns" or animals?
[2022-12-08 16:29:13] <Tigozawr> It's DF the horses are probably in constant distress there LUL
[2022-12-08 16:29:21] <benupde287> Whos to say hes distressed? Maybe he just wanted to climb.
[2022-12-08 16:29:25] <DrHermelin> does*
[2022-12-08 16:29:26] <Termak> it tried to escape the pasture
[2022-12-08 16:29:36] <Valentin_PV> he was a smart horse. He knew to keep quiet to not attract the attention of whatever was scaring him
[2022-12-08 16:29:38] <Inglonias> I don't think this game has sound aside from the soundtrack, but I could be wrong
[2022-12-08 16:29:39] <Hanknasty1> RimWorld is a game you play. dwarf fortress is a machine. and you are a cog in that machine. and the machine will destroy or crush you randomly whenever with no concern
[2022-12-08 16:29:47] <Starlocke> that's odd.
[2022-12-08 16:30:04] <PoisoningTheWell> maybe there is a horse in the tree

[2022-12-08 16:31:05] <+Draaven> I usually put in a table
[2022-12-08 16:31:08] <%+yourfate> you actually don't need a table, but I usually put them in there
[2022-12-08 16:31:08] <benupde287> Office is a chair minimum
[2022-12-08 16:31:13] <Termak> dont need table unless want fancy
[2022-12-08 16:31:14] <Murdoc_2> @Loketta Don't get me started on birds. I lost a fort last night to agitated ravens
[2022-12-08 16:31:22] <$H2O4S> That's the most apt description I've ever read @Loketta
[2022-12-08 16:31:23] <Starlocke> offices are basically "command rooms", like throne rooms.
[2022-12-08 16:31:39] <benupde287> Table is also useful so your worker can eat in their office
[2022-12-08 16:31:46] <Termak> office can be just chair middle of corridor
[2022-12-08 16:31:50] <Hanknasty1> I add a table because it helps with my immersion. I like to picture my admins at their desk
[2022-12-08 16:31:53] <Starlocke> although... brokers do their office work purely sitting on the stool and in memory?
[2022-12-08 16:32:00] <Starlocke> i mean, the stockkeeper type.
[2022-12-08 16:32:06] <fantom_flasch> All of my dwarves pray all the time. They don't get anything done because they are at church every day

[2022-12-08 16:35:06] <+chaostrojan> ok ty
[2022-12-08 16:35:10] <PatchyMaster> you need to give the possesed what they ask for
[2022-12-08 16:35:12] <Hanknasty1> they have to perform the craft they are possessed by
[2022-12-08 16:35:21] <+chaostrojan> ahh kk cheers
[2022-12-08 16:35:25] <Hanknasty1> so they need the required workshop and materials.
[2022-12-08 16:35:37] <benupde287> You should see your stockpile numbers up top get more and more precise
[2022-12-08 16:36:02] <Hanknasty1> possession might be the one where they have to murder someone and use their body to make crafts

[2022-12-08 16:42:32] <+Loketta> Rimworld you try and survive the game, DF you try and survive your own decisions
[2022-12-08 16:42:35] <+sventyard> @adanos_ger that's fun.
[2022-12-08 16:42:46] <Starlocke> @Loketta lol

[2022-12-08 16:47:16] <Termak> you might need to specify "shellcrafting" instead of bonecrafting *shrug* i havent played DF for years
[2022-12-08 16:47:25] <Starlocke> 'greeings from the mountain...'
[2022-12-08 16:47:28] <Starlocke> very dorf.

[2022-12-08 16:48:42] <Starlocke> co-op DF multiplayer stuff would be a nice mod.
[2022-12-08 16:49:05] <Hanknasty1> possibly might be a large religious group in your fort that want a temple
[2022-12-08 16:49:12] <Inglonias> @Starlocke it's a wonderful dream, but it is wonderful because it is impossible.
[2022-12-08 16:49:21] <Krompus> There are succession games, kind of like taking turns co-op :)
[2022-12-08 16:49:43] <Krompus> play set amount of time and pass your save
[2022-12-08 16:49:48] <Pticrix> I've had fruit leather
[2022-12-08 16:49:50] <Starlocke> "zoom" + "shared screen" perhaps... lol
[2022-12-08 16:50:15] <Inglonias> Some of the most famous DF stories have been succession games.
[2022-12-08 16:50:18] VIEWERS: 522
[2022-12-08 16:50:32] <DeadRobotDev> It'd be cool to see a Twitch succession save in the future
[2022-12-08 16:50:37] <Starlocke> but shared-interface doesn't do parallel operations, sadly.
[2022-12-08 16:50:38] <Inglonias> See the classic trilogy - Boatmurdered, Headshoots, and Syrupleaf
[2022-12-08 16:50:50] <Starlocke> backpacks are for the soldiers.
[2022-12-08 16:50:57] <DeadRobotDev> I think my favourite story is still The Hamlet of Tyranny
[2022-12-08 16:51:02] <Tigozawr> Army dwarves use backpacks to carry food, I believe
[2022-12-08 16:51:03] <+Draaven> Backpacks let soldiers carry water and rations
[2022-12-08 16:51:04] <benupde287> Its for soldiers to carry their kit
[2022-12-08 16:51:17] <%+Nygardable> kiriHi hey kiri. are you a full-fledged dwarf yet?
[2022-12-08 16:51:18] <Starlocke> no backpacks = derpy soldiers.
[2022-12-08 16:51:22] <Hanknasty1> just watch blinds YouTube videos
[2022-12-08 16:51:33] <Hanknasty1> his wife makes custom art for his forts and everythinf
[2022-12-08 16:51:38] <Tigozawr> @2DKiri If they have a backpack, they'll stay stationed longer without going to the tavern to eat
[2022-12-08 16:51:39] <Hanknasty1> very good storyteller
[2022-12-08 16:52:11] <DeadRobotDev> Have you at least watched the stairs one? I think that's the most important, and most painful to figure out by yourself (as I discovered many times)
[2022-12-08 16:52:11] <Starlocke> i love how chat crowd is wholesome mentoring.

[2022-12-08 16:56:44] <%$Reger464> is pearlash literally ash made from pearls?
[2022-12-08 16:56:50] <%+Nygardable> passed out from anger....I've been there
[2022-12-08 16:57:07] <+SinisterOctopus> Typically it's pot-ash
[2022-12-08 16:57:23] <Termak> look the bed, it should say if someone uses it
[2022-12-08 16:57:35] <+SinisterOctopus> Make fine meals too
[2022-12-08 16:57:39] <!%Phlamethrower> "Potassium carbonate is the primary component of potash and the more refined pearl ash or salts of tartar."
[2022-12-08 16:58:09] <+Draaven> A Fine meal uses three ingredients and will result in stews. A Lavish meal uses four ingredients and will result in roasts.
[2022-12-08 16:58:16] <Tigozawr> Meals are made from anything edible
