[2023-01-06 15:33:30] <%Classed> The knight update is good for him
[2023-01-06 15:33:34] <NIK16092006> he needed it.

[2023-01-06 15:33:36] <%ARCANUMINQUISITOR> What changed with knight?
[2023-01-06 15:33:37] <%ElectricLotus> @imkloon is there actually any real threat of losing the bubba license or is it just speculation at the moment?
[2023-01-06 15:33:38] <%$DanyR> knight is really scary now
[2023-01-06 15:33:39] <Symbolic_Mind> I’m glad because the knight looks and seems they could be so cool
[2023-01-06 15:33:41] <%+imasaru_> hensL hensL
[2023-01-06 15:33:41] <AidenMaestro> Knight is alot scarier now
[2023-01-06 15:33:45] <+NekoShepherd> Yeah, I like playing Knight and those changes seem pog
[2023-01-06 15:33:47] <stalemaccasfries> @somethingjacket enfury, coup is too easy to waste and frustrating, enfury is super reliable
[2023-01-06 15:33:48] <%SarahlMS> what the changes did exatcly?
[2023-01-06 15:33:51] <%+Dean_N64> Not much negatives to this update really, its just all good
[2023-01-06 15:33:51] <%Classed> He’s a lot more dangerous in chase
[2023-01-06 15:34:01] <+LunaTheSadist> @Hens333 Do you have any plans to make a video about Knight's changes & new potential ?
[2023-01-06 15:34:04] <ibukimioda97> knight looks the same to me , I feel like dropping minions on loops is still better
[2023-01-06 15:34:07] <imkloon> @ElectricLotus its based on the ptb gamecode afaik
[2023-01-06 15:34:13] <JulianCalabasas> really, the changes are enough?

[2023-01-06 15:35:03] <somethingjacket> unless im wrong
[2023-01-06 15:35:08] <@%Ana1661> You can see the grass moving when the path is being set
[2023-01-06 15:35:13] <@%Ana1661> As a survivor
[2023-01-06 15:35:15] <%Classed> I realise now in the next dev update, you can see the guards go through grass like spirit if you notice that subtle stuff
[2023-01-06 15:35:17] <+NekoShepherd> Can survivors hold W and outrun all of the guards with no obstacles at max length?

[2023-01-06 15:35:31] <PlanetNM> Did they change anything to make dropping a knight immediately worse, or did they just buff the long paths?

[2023-01-06 16:13:47] <+coco_dbd> survivor hud means if solo survivors see someone repairing they run to the killer to loop and not do gens, well we dont know, but could be. and killers fear more gen efficiency
[2023-01-06 16:13:52] <+grouphome11> when we had purple,green,iri 1 ranks matchmaking was great!

[2023-01-06 16:14:14] <chinnduke> Yea @unclebensuncle i have the same. MMR is sick. every single game minimal hours of survs - 2k hours. Usually 4/5k +
[2023-01-06 16:14:16] <beereyy> imagine the crazy amount of genlocking nurses if the blink back addon makes it to live servers
[2023-01-06 16:14:20] <+Propret> Wouldn't it be better if MMR was removed altogether and the lobby was kinda random?
[2023-01-06 16:14:26] <FrostWalk3r_> efficient dbd is so boring in a normal game
[2023-01-06 16:14:32] <+traite1> still get hit maybe its latecny

[2023-01-06 16:59:05] <!%SupaAlf> you should vs arinad with the squad hens actually, would be a juicer video

[2023-01-06 17:00:34] <+BokehDan> How has the competition been in EU vs NA? Have you noticed a change?

[2023-01-06 17:02:48] <pracel> its cringe but still a mindgame in a sense.
[2023-01-06 17:02:59] <Yellowinz> eh, I think there is a point where you never get surprised by rng is good for killers like clown
[2023-01-06 17:02:59] <ClockworkPierrot> I think the video would be pretty cool since otz made a video using it and arinad guide went semi viral in the community  having an antithesis is very dope

[2023-01-06 17:06:35] <MagiMind> @cory_9 u right ig, idk im new to dbd, the mindset of some people seems really toxic for a game that should be about having a good time

[2023-01-06 17:11:34] <BlightedCat> Hens, I wanted to know your opinion on the loose crank addon. Would you say it's a crutch addon that you don't need to use and shouldn't use it if you want to get better, or is it more like an addon that allows him to do more, kinda like maybe engravings on Billy?
[2023-01-06 17:11:41] <Pauly03> @xbayharborbutcher I just got lethal pursuer today when I got nemi to p1, still need to get it on the rest of my killers though, I like bbq too, gets me into chases much faster

[2023-01-06 17:25:14] <%Chief_Ohnay> maybe part was that the community and matchmaking pool were smaller, so you ran into the same players more often?

[2023-01-06 17:29:40] <leturbine> @helterseltzer that's why suggest that 20 second aura reveal. to make the 4 Stacks more common and which survivor would complain about spread downs?

[2023-01-06 17:42:23] <%+globo12343> @adnips fr I remember even before balance changes, I had a streamer in my team who called me dumb and selfish for not saving her when she was on the OTHER side of the map and didn’t realize ghostie mechanics worked that you can reveal even on hook. I was so glad I had left her to die, I wasn’t even healed either

[2023-01-06 18:20:08] <%+ForestGrandpa> I mean, tunneling is deliberately going for someone while ignoring everyone else purposefully. I dont think other "definitions" are valid beyond that. Yepge

[2023-01-06 18:21:54] <%$DanyR> @Not_a_Real_Cop All of that is a waste of time. You want to deny a tunneler the points and kills. Force them to walk out of the game with a 1k and they might just not tunnel next game.

[2023-01-06 18:26:33] <%$DanyR> @SamGamegy Iridescent Shard Prices  A few months back, we announced that all non-licensed outfits would receive an option to purchase with Iridescent Shards roughly a month after they first appear in the store.  By extension, existing outfits will also receive Iridescent Shard options, but this is being done in batches of a few characters at a time. So far, we’ve added this option to outfits for The Trapper, The Wraith, The Hillbilly, The Nurse, The Huntress, The Doctor, The Hag, Dwight, Claudet

[2023-01-06 19:17:15] <%Chief_Ohnay> @suriizexx friday means people are usually more active in chat (college students usually don't have as much going on, classes-wise), and people start getting more social.

[2023-01-06 19:18:47] <%Chief_Ohnay> @bleachednoodz vile purge (green vom) does not consume PWYF stacks since it cannot directly inflict a damage state.
[2023-01-06 19:18:52] <davidmakes_games> he's asking about the C Major Scale.
[2023-01-06 19:18:56] <+suriizexx> @BurrowingParrot what do they mean?

[2023-01-06 19:22:22] <visheena> This is an interesting build, since plague is more efficient with health state perks

[2023-01-06 19:23:24] <OooldG> @mankapi she's hard to play against and she counters healing builds, she makes soloq a nightmare also, she can be very frustrating

[2023-01-06 19:24:03] <+pbevertv> Eyrie moment
[2023-01-06 19:24:05] <OooldG> so is cleansing not meant to bypass deep wound?

[2023-01-06 19:24:17] <+MiserEnoch> @j0nathanGaming Ditto
[2023-01-06 19:24:22] <FlameGuard76> so many pallets in such a small area

[2023-01-06 19:24:43] <+MiserEnoch> @Hens333 Could try it in a custom non-PTB game and see?
[2023-01-06 19:24:55] <%theringu> Eyrie op for plague
[2023-01-06 19:24:58] <%$mary_6559> cleansing heal one health state i think
[2023-01-06 19:25:00] <%theringu> therin12W1ggleSadako
[2023-01-06 19:25:01] <OooldG> now it depends on whether cleansing is meant to bring you up a health state or just make you healthy
[2023-01-06 19:25:01] <mankapi> @OooldG so people just leave cause they can't heal themselves, dear god
[2023-01-06 19:25:02] <%Chief_Ohnay> @mankapi yeah, but if some survivors bring CoH and a medkit to every game, then throw a lil baby tantrum when they can't get value out of them
[2023-01-06 19:25:03] <+pbevertv> it's probably a bug since they never said anything about it
[2023-01-06 19:25:06] <%hexdrix> @MiserEnoch He's not in the ptb
[2023-01-06 19:25:37] <j0nathanGaming> So green puke doesn't count as an offensive action for PWYF?
[2023-01-06 19:25:41] <OooldG> @mankapi it's also the fact that if you don't coordinate properly and someone keeps wasting time cleansing and giving her corrupt purge it makes it incredibly hard to do anything
[2023-01-06 19:25:46] <+MiserEnoch> @j0nathanGaming Nope
[2023-01-06 19:25:46] <%+Phat_Loot_2000> @j0nathanGaming nope
[2023-01-06 19:25:46] <%Chief_Ohnay> @j0nathanGaming can't directly inflict a damage state
[2023-01-06 19:25:52] <+MiserEnoch> Free health state loss for the killer
[2023-01-06 19:25:57] <%Chief_Ohnay> @j0nathanGaming so doesn't count for losing PWYF stacks
[2023-01-06 19:26:05] <j0nathanGaming> but I presume red puke does
[2023-01-06 19:26:11] <%Chief_Ohnay> @j0nathanGaming correct!

[2023-01-06 19:28:38] <%Chief_Ohnay> anything that directly can inflict a damage state consumes stacks of PWYF. Plague's Vile Purge (green vom) and (iirc) setting Trapper traps, because they do not DIRECTLY inflict damage states, do not consume stacks
[2023-01-06 19:28:44] <+MiserEnoch> Anyone else prefer the green puke to the red? I love the information and broken status it gets. Plus you know exactly where the survivors have to go

[2023-01-06 19:32:05] <LukasBaize> Potential energy, repressed alliance, and blast mine are the only counters I can think of
[2023-01-06 19:32:07] <+Kaljnn> vittorio's new perk might help in a 3 gen situation
[2023-01-06 19:32:10] <%Chief_Ohnay> @thatquan 4x potential energy on a corner gen is like the only counter

[2023-01-06 19:32:35] <%ElectricLotus> omg i am on such a massive delay
[2023-01-06 19:32:40] <+Syth202> potential can def fix a three gen but that's assuming the survivors can use it properly AND not get hit before getting to use it
[2023-01-06 19:32:42] <drpeppertaco> fair but if they hold a 3gen from the start just break it if its super clear, problem is solo queue will never get a gen in a 3 gen to 40 seconds complete
[2023-01-06 19:32:45] <thatquan> @hens333 running away does not work due to them camping the same 3 gens the entire game. It’s literally 90% of my games

[2023-01-06 19:46:18] <%Chief_Ohnay> @lovelymann slinger is 110, so it's not as strong as you would think.

[2023-01-06 19:46:42] <JefferyYOKA> I think it would be better if you kill Yui and stop the 2nd last gen there
[2023-01-06 19:46:54] <+SyferCon> i feel like deathslinger is a fun killer but not itop tier imho
[2023-01-06 19:46:54] <%theringu> That would’ve been insane

[2023-01-06 19:47:16] <lovelymann> but slinger can catch surv from 18 meters away
[2023-01-06 19:47:20] <alexababby_> What do u think about bubba probably leaving the game

[2023-01-06 19:48:41] <%theringu> Yeah @oooldg  :) blight

[2023-01-06 19:49:00] <%Chief_Ohnay> @OooldG mayyyybe, but why would you not take advantage of its secondary effect?
[2023-01-06 19:49:03] <+gargoyle3333> @theringu my personal take: it doesn't matter if you win or lose. Killer is fun when you have good chases for me. I think if you focus on that, your viewers will enjoy it too
[2023-01-06 19:49:14] <%+diiidi1> yeah
[2023-01-06 19:49:23] <OooldG> @theringu even on blight if I'm running lethal I feel like I have to run some aura read otherwise my brain yells at me
[2023-01-06 19:49:29] <+benji_8080> @diiidi1 legion definitely
[2023-01-06 19:49:30] <%Chief_Ohnay> @diiidi1 Nemesis, bubba, billy. Killers who are incentivized to go for M2s in place of M1s

[2023-01-06 20:03:57] <OooldG> even though I don't think it's really op anymore I still hate dead hard
[2023-01-06 20:03:59] <+Sinott> im almost stoping playing dbd again, and again the reason is im tired of dead hards, lol
[2023-01-06 20:04:04] <%theringu> Good thing the devs switched the meta up with DH Kappa
[2023-01-06 20:04:12] <OooldG> if I could delete 2 perks rn they'd be dh and eruption
[2023-01-06 20:04:17] <%+diiidi1> @pbevertv tbf i hate the old dh more haha, the new one is ok
[2023-01-06 20:04:28] <+gargoyle3333> I wanted dead hard to be a little burst of speed with no iframes. Then all they can do is get to a loop, not take hits at a pallet or something
[2023-01-06 20:04:31] <+InsolentCrab> to be fair it's a pretty nice box
[2023-01-06 20:04:31] <+pbevertv> eh, they're both annoying, but for different reasons

[2023-01-06 20:12:12] <+vicentec17> @theringu with lopro and a high dpi you can hit a pallet and then 180, much more than a normal curve
[2023-01-06 20:12:32] <Yaboi__nate> implying people see hillbilly enough to know the difference

[2023-01-06 20:13:08] <OooldG> you can dodge chainsaw with crouches on stairs if that's what you mean @diiidi1
[2023-01-06 20:13:09] <+vicentec17> @diiidi1 yes it can, there are some shack variations where you can crouch in the doorway and become impossible to chainsaw
[2023-01-06 20:13:56] <%MrFeeshMan> That animation skip when they DH but get validated is hilarious

[2023-01-06 20:16:13] <OooldG> @tadija36 it might be better to start with a more basic killer, if you get used to nurse it'll be hard to learn other killers because she's very unique
[2023-01-06 20:16:16] <+vicentec17> @kazstar yep billy saw hitbox is a little high, so crouching on a decline can make you impossible to hit sometimes

[2023-01-06 20:17:19] <%MegaFangKing> The Nurse nerf is nice but not devistating. Will still be the "win button" of DBD I feel. Best killer in the game.
[2023-01-06 20:17:23] <%+diiidi1> i mean the chainsaw, like nemi m2, if you crouch you can dodge his m2, i thought it would work against Billy too
