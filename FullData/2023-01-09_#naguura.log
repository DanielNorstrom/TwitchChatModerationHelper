[2023-01-09 13:35:14] <+Kelevra142> tbh, since the teleport is just a time saver i think it should be available on 15's not 20's
[2023-01-09 13:35:31] <demento1337> I heard something about stat penalty. im a enhancer and i have 36% mastery 22% haste and 28% crit. above 30% do i get a 10% penalty? can someone explain me this pls?

[2023-01-09 13:36:25] <constantinvaldor_> @demento1337 its like what you said. there is a diminishing return on secondary stats - From 0 to 30%, there's no penalty. From 30% to 39%, there's a 10% penalty. From 39% to 47%, there's a 20% penalty. From 47% to 54%, there's a 30% penalty. From 54% to 66%, there's a 40% penalty. From 66% to 126%, there's a 50% penalty

[2023-01-09 15:16:07] <+nbreew> @nbreew after a wipe, if you start with the default strat of 3 balls on fire then wind, the goals on wind won't count. Idk if they fixed it yet, but I've spend a good 3 hours on a +21 last saturday because of that

[2023-01-09 15:16:49] <%Sebleh> For M council, my buddy that's got 4PC said he was struggling to use Umbral procs on Starfire because he just had way too much AP and no time to cast. Is this actually a thing that happens with 4pc on that fight?
[2023-01-09 15:17:05] <@%JohnnyOneLung> dude I just rerolled on NA servers, so unforch, I totes could have timed that for you
[2023-01-09 15:17:16] <emnitthy> @sebleh that fight is literally a fucking nightmare cause you cannot spend your astral power fast enough

[2023-01-09 15:43:18] <+blitzxkreig> hey took a long break from wow and I'm coming back to PVE/PVP what would u suggest dps wise to be able to do great in both?
[2023-01-09 15:43:50] <Silver_GamingTV> @naguura do you wanna go into eclipse or after you applying the dots?
[2023-01-09 15:43:53] <+Gummyxyz> @blitzxkreig Rogue or dh are almost always safe for m+ and pvp
[2023-01-09 15:43:57] <%danjidogs> starfall doesn't give stacks to the mobs i guess, but some ppl say don't and also don't place dots on both

[2023-01-09 16:05:53] <Malkomod> its because data has to be in a certain context. Some damage aren't effective.
[2023-01-09 16:06:05] <%HiEntropy> That makes sense. You sound like me when I play Unholy. Depending on how long the pack will live, sometimes you should spread all the disease and wounds. Just start cleaving.

[2023-01-09 16:15:29] <patofazquack> are you playing with solar beam in m+ or are you letting the circus burn?
[2023-01-09 16:15:29] <+melinoor> once you practice enough of the rotation and cds, balance is easy

[2023-01-09 16:15:41] <%+Banjo586> it's a bit more complicated than convoke 9.0 moonkin though KEKW
[2023-01-09 16:15:45] <justjoeyokay> once you play the class for 10 years, it's not that hard

[2023-01-09 16:16:37] <+melinoor> its the same as a demonology warlock, seems complicated until you play it and understand it

[2023-01-09 16:20:07] <%+Ol_squishy> YES, That is almost always what I see when people have low DPS, large gaps in casting because they are debating the best button.

[2023-01-09 17:50:55] <Terri_on_twitch> there is a nice addon "COS helper" that gives you a tooltip and a chat announcement who can interact with things (class, profession, race), highly recommend that

[2023-01-09 18:10:43] <%mike32s> static empowerment is BIS if your healers are good enough to heal you through all the fire you stand in
[2023-01-09 18:10:53] <sethcurryww> i think static empowerment is especially good as melee
[2023-01-09 18:11:01] <stepbro_gi> is that the potion that shocks everyhting for like 30 seconds ?
[2023-01-09 18:11:08] <Gillrad> it used to be necessary for tree boss in high keys pre-nerf. Now not so much
[2023-01-09 18:11:13] <+Amyrantha_> in what universe do you stand still for 5 sec as dps
[2023-01-09 18:11:15] <%+madhatterui> yea not melee
[2023-01-09 18:11:15] <+drymeen30> Wdym it's perfect for tree. You just lose your flask for every add pop and get speed to cuck your mates over LUL

[2023-01-09 18:14:21] <%Quadda> Some specs use that as the default phial tho, it's super bait.

[2023-01-09 18:14:26] <%suessjuice> I tink you mean the potion of shocking disclosure for the tree boss
[2023-01-09 18:14:26] <%+sflo0> TARGET DUMMY!
[2023-01-09 18:14:27] <+Revoca> its 5 sec...

[2023-01-09 18:14:29] <@%cayna> when hitting target dummies?
[2023-01-09 18:14:29] <CousinAvi86> but it also gives a burst of speed, and you're likely moving to avoid a mechanic, so you can get set up quickly again
[2023-01-09 18:14:31] <@%cayna> Duh..
[2023-01-09 18:14:31] <WopsyEU> so just stand in fire and blame the healer
[2023-01-09 18:14:31] <Gillrad> people were confusing the phial with the potion of shocking disclosure
[2023-01-09 18:14:32] <+drymeen30> tbh I might try static empowerment as mage for fights there's not much swirleys and I can move using blink only, as a challenge (didn't try if blinking removes it yet)

[2023-01-09 18:16:47] <CousinAvi86> simcraft typically based on "patchwerk-style fight", right?
[2023-01-09 18:16:50] <VipMalis> if your only ranged with paladin healing, in most cases ranged player be far away with beacon on him
[2023-01-09 18:16:54] <%+sflo0> @sim967 yeah, we understood what you mean. naguura over there misunderstood its ok.

[2023-01-09 18:18:43] <Kaazmor> @Naguura Hi, I have a question about Embelisments. We can have 2 Embelisment at the a time. I have Lariat, which is 1 Embelisment. Can I wear 2-piece crafted set with it? (which also says 'Embelisment(2)' per piece. Are the 2 set items count as 1 Embelisment? Thx. :)
[2023-01-09 18:18:51] <+Revoca> Have you tried any Toxic Phials they are pretty nice @Naguura
[2023-01-09 18:18:55] <sethcurryww> i am losing my mind

[2023-01-09 18:20:12] <@%cayna> they just give a 2p
[2023-01-09 18:20:13] <@%cayna> yeah exactly
[2023-01-09 18:20:19] <DawsOnly> i'm confused now
[2023-01-09 18:20:24] <udk3_dev> ?
[2023-01-09 18:20:28] <DeeloGames> oh no
[2023-01-09 18:20:31] <kniftty> Each item says "embellishment" on it
[2023-01-09 18:20:38] <+Alfernickof> hey big mama whats that next to the tree on the back of your room?
[2023-01-09 18:20:39] <%Quadda> Isn't the food buff duration technically an embelishment even tho it doesn't count towards the 2?
[2023-01-09 18:20:40] <+paralysi5> except for the food one, it dosent count towards the 2
[2023-01-09 18:20:45] <FrucaTe> what, my set doesnt say anything about embellishment
[2023-01-09 18:20:49] <udk3_dev> ah
[2023-01-09 18:20:49] <BafflingRainbow> you can only have two items equiped with embelishment
[2023-01-09 18:20:55] <HighThereBud> What is the food one called?
[2023-01-09 18:21:02] <@%itsClubby> @Alfernickof HUHH
[2023-01-09 18:21:02] <nitekiller198> are you not healing this season?
[2023-01-09 18:21:11] <Frolul> Should be embellishment (1/2) or (2/2)
[2023-01-09 18:21:21] <FrucaTe> okay actually my bad im stupid :D
[2023-01-09 18:21:24] <+Gwyndalen> theyre confusing TIER and EMBELLISHMENT sents
[2023-01-09 18:21:24] <BafflingRainbow> the (2) is how many you can wear, if it doesnt say, youre fine
[2023-01-09 18:21:28] <DawsOnly> OH ok. thought you were talking abut raid
[2023-01-09 18:21:28] <DeeloGames> HAHA not trololing, I'm just an idiot

[2023-01-09 18:22:21] <+magicman133> Needs an "Embellished" tag on the item like mythic or heroic
[2023-01-09 18:22:50] <Kolosus64> @Naguura Thanks, I hadn't considered that! Makes a lot of sense
[2023-01-09 18:23:07] <%+scavi95> Considered using chonky character sheet weakaura? super nice for gear inspect

[2023-01-09 18:24:55] <%+sim967> I’ve lost track, so take that with a grain of salt
[2023-01-09 18:25:04] <+drymeen30> @Halaz24 no, there is no limit, but so far we only have 3 sparks since there's one every 2 weeks
[2023-01-09 18:25:15] <lvl_up_together> we get a spark tomorrow right or did i misunderstand this?

[2023-01-09 18:32:07] <%Androiid42> bracers from eng have a tinker socket only
[2023-01-09 18:32:18] <+keldaerion> So for example, for a cloth wearer the crafted shoulders are typically the ones to go with. Would you still be able to put it on the crafted cloth shoulders?

[2023-01-09 20:32:09] <+uncledougschickens> ok sorry it might be long, a guy i recrafted for had a rank 3 item, with my current skills I could recraft it to rank 5 with inspire proc. Inspire procced first attempt but it stayed at rank 4. He used rank 2 materials for the initial craft and rank 2 for the recraft he sent me. He wanted to try again with tier 3 materials and inspire procced again but still it remained rank 4. Am I missing something here or would he have to recraft several times with rank 3 materials to overwrite the rank 2's?

[2023-01-09 20:35:14] <+Royce_Kronos> I think you item remembers what quality mats you used. Recrafts replace 40% of the old mats with the new.

[2023-01-09 20:36:22] <+Ark_the_Human> There are definitely some bugs with the system. I have multicrafted a negative amount of potions several times. Like, making potions always creates at least 5, but I've had multicrafts make like 2 potions.
[2023-01-09 20:36:28] VIEWERS: 2 693
[2023-01-09 20:36:40] <%Sebleh> Well crafting also tells you that you need X amount to guarantee a certain rank but i crafted a bunch of potions at the skill required (it said 212 for R2 guaranteed and I had 212) and gave me R1
[2023-01-09 20:36:46] <+uncledougschickens> its so overcomplicated and I cant be sure if Im wrong or the game is wrong
[2023-01-09 20:36:48] <%Sebleh> There’s some buggy or unclear stuff.
[2023-01-09 20:36:49] <ajudanta> Do you need a Concentrated Primal Infusion for each recraft?
[2023-01-09 20:37:05] <Frolul> @ajudanta no

[2023-01-09 20:37:53] <%+LtJenkins> Infusions are like misssives, they become part of the item when you craft
[2023-01-09 20:38:22] <+demiralos> @Sebleh I had the same happen with some else crafting stuff, and when I got 1 skill over, I got next rank-.
