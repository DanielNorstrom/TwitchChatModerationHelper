[2022-12-27 10:16:03] <@%jaroniscaring> @six041209 it can change depending on tournament
[2022-12-27 10:16:03] <sujythebrave> @six041209 usually 90 min to 2h +increment.

[2022-12-27 10:16:06] <kebab681> It looks like a Kramnik sicilian if the c-pawn extends.

[2022-12-27 10:16:32] <@%+Creamsicle> @six041209 the standard is 90 minutes per player with +30 seconds every move, but usually at this level they get another 30 or 60 minutes at various move counts to add more time

[2022-12-27 10:17:11] <@%tagbon> @six041209 the "time control" is something like 90mins first 40 moves, then another 60mins added, with each move adding 30 seconds. So the games last between 4 to 6 hours

[2022-12-27 10:30:16] <+go_juddy> Can’t they just input the next move into an AI simulator and it will tell them what move to make?
[2022-12-27 10:30:18] <Artoria_Pendrgon> well yes you want to keep the pressure until you can't bare it anymore or you win something

[2022-12-27 10:54:32] <@%^Moobot> @shahrul The World Rapid and Blitz is TWO events! The Rapid is a 13 Rd 15+10 Swiss Tournament over 3 days. The Blitz is a 21 Rd 3+2 Swiss Tournament over 2 days -- if players tie for 1st place there's always a playoff!
[2022-12-27 10:54:33] <$chanr35> Darn, I thought with two passed pawns he would surely win. Tough game.

[2022-12-27 11:02:42] <dyxofficial> i like how the rook is in the same row of the pawn so it pushes it to make it a queen
[2022-12-27 11:02:46] <$chanr35> You have to move your arm way quicker and further than a mouse.

[2022-12-27 11:25:58] <yogishyam> Hikaru drew the 12 year old?
[2022-12-27 11:26:08] <$chanr35> @katakuri4life Alienware and razer are more known for gaming these days.
[2022-12-27 11:26:09] <%GMHikarooo> hikaruJAM
[2022-12-27 11:26:11] <Ali_Ahmed_345> did hikaru drew the previous game?
[2022-12-27 11:26:13] <$chanr35> But I think Asus is like an underdog.
[2022-12-27 11:26:17] <@%+Creamsicle> @yogishyam no he drew Predke haha, a very talented GM
[2022-12-27 11:26:20] <@%+Creamsicle> @Ali_Ahmed_345 yeah
[2022-12-27 11:26:21] <lllelectroniclll> what did hikaru do so far in this tour ?
[2022-12-27 11:26:23] <sujythebrave> @GourmADA cap, u are not. Game get tougher for people at the top at tournament progress and draw % increase. its historical fact from all previous WRAB.
[2022-12-27 11:26:27] <bigspooky123abc> Why did he draw
[2022-12-27 11:26:29] <driver1036> Hikaru drew game 6
[2022-12-27 11:26:37] <bojmir95> 4/6 is still world class
[2022-12-27 11:26:37] <katakuri4life> I like how alienware looks or even those razers
[2022-12-27 11:26:43] <$chanr35> @katakuri4life Several reasons why I would go with an Asus, they make the best motherboards anyway.
[2022-12-27 11:26:46] <+ifonlythatweretrue> @katakuri4life if you want long battery life, macbook is definitely best for traveling
[2022-12-27 11:26:47] <Ali_Ahmed_345> he had an advantage right @creamsicle
[2022-12-27 11:26:51] <@%+Creamsicle> @bigspooky123abc predke defended insanely, hope there's a recap so you can see
[2022-12-27 11:26:56] <@%tagbon> Hikaru's results have been - draw draw win win draw draw
[2022-12-27 11:26:57] <GourmADA> @sujythebrave  I know thats why I'm sure hikaru won't be first
[2022-12-27 11:27:00] <@%+Creamsicle> @Ali_Ahmed_345 yeah but predke defended insanely

[2022-12-27 11:27:15] <blueballoon95> What happened in the Predke game?
[2022-12-27 11:27:16] <@%tagbon> Predke used to be 12 yrs old tho. Just before he turned 13

[2022-12-27 11:31:53] <sujythebrave> @GourmADA thats not how swiss tournaments work. It work by score and elo giving tie score, which mean that Hikaru is likely to get a player in the 2550 range now, which is much easier then his first two rounds. Please, do some research.

[2022-12-27 11:40:22] <@%^Moobot> @Greadfen The World Rapid and Blitz is TWO events! The Rapid is a 13 Rd 15+10 Swiss Tournament over 3 days. The Blitz is a 21 Rd 3+2 Swiss Tournament over 2 days -- if players tie for 1st place there's always a playoff!
[2022-12-27 11:40:26] <%+TheSincrow> Ugh Hikaru needs to unlock God mode!!!

[2022-12-27 11:41:00] <sujythebrave> @GourmADA again, you are failing to understand. If you want a better assessment of player chances and skill, look at their current classical rating.
[2022-12-27 11:41:03] <yogishyam> How does magneto do it
[2022-12-27 11:41:06] <shurox_92> Chat whats your rating??

[2022-12-27 11:41:55] <sujythebrave> @ChaeDoc which is top 55 basically, its not too impressive. There are a lot of 2500-2575 players on 4/6. they got there with getting paired with other 2500.

[2022-12-27 12:14:18] <bojmir95> 5/7 draws is going for silver
[2022-12-27 12:14:19] <+AwaykeNN> @Hunzen Piece was lost anyways, if you play Rd8 than Rxc1 wasn't a move. So instead of defending the knight you get a pawn and a bishop for it
[2022-12-27 12:14:23] <furlong135> If you wanna win you can’t keep drawing against the people the winners beat

[2022-12-27 13:27:42] <Neperuu> a kid is a kid, what else could it mean. chat is full of snowflakes  LUL
[2022-12-27 13:27:44] <tftserenity> reducing him on his age doesnt do it credit.. hes a talent
[2022-12-27 13:27:50] <yogishyam> Hikaru boutta beat the youngling like Anakin

[2022-12-27 13:28:07] <art_360> The thing is Hikaru is playing all these solid openings leading to a draw. He needs to play these tournaments like a Titled tuesday honestly he would do much better
[2022-12-27 13:28:08] <nxc__03> @yogishyam ignites saber
[2022-12-27 13:28:08] <tftserenity> @sleex4 i can get behind that

[2022-12-27 13:30:07] <$BreadTime> @tftserenity they refer to all GMs by their last names but call him kid. Like they are derogatory, he’s good “for a kid”

[2022-12-27 13:45:06] <$chanr35> I think HIkaru will win this because he has the double bishops.

[2022-12-27 13:47:52] <ayaya_won_whatcanyoudo> @aerial_boi hammer would be 8 out of 7 by now

[2022-12-27 13:47:58] <s1lvaa99> @notanothername so they are going to play again or what?

[2022-12-27 14:03:11] <nucleotide1337> hikaru's openings are abit too solid, thats why he doesnt win often, he needs more risk and play positions where alot of pieces stay on the board, not trading 6 pieces on move 8

[2022-12-27 15:10:44] <%ShinyTriangles> @qtjelly 4 draws Sadge none of Hikaru's opponents blundered Sadge

[2022-12-27 15:10:51] <art_360> @clydey2times He played very drawish lines. Look at magnus he played b3 g3 kind of stuff. Hikaru excels in sidelines that how he dominates all these players online

[2022-12-27 15:26:53] <@%^Moobot> @5aud_ The World Rapid and Blitz is TWO events! The Rapid is a 13 Rd 15+10 Swiss Tournament over 3 days. The Blitz is a 21 Rd 3+2 Swiss Tournament over 2 days -- if players tie for 1st place there's always a playoff!
