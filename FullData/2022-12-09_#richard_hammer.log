[2022-12-09 00:00:05] <%Lakart> I literally got frozen hamsters in today for snake food richLUL
[2022-12-09 00:00:32] <@%+JimmyNintendo> They don't stop lol
[2022-12-09 00:00:48] <@%+JimmyNintendo> You can geld them
[2022-12-09 00:00:55] <+Cantroz> That cats a stud
[2022-12-09 00:00:59] <PlaceboSaggins> giga chad cat
[2022-12-09 00:01:45] <%GoRibGo> you got me there
[2022-12-09 00:03:30] <$Thruxed> from the kittens
[2022-12-09 00:03:47] <mihns> You know where Sadge
[2022-12-09 00:04:21] <%+MrZev> it bothers me every time you say dolomite... it just reminds me of Futurama
[2022-12-09 00:04:35] <%Lakart> It makes me think of the movies
[2022-12-09 00:06:19] <%Danphion> i went and made dinner, i see your colony didn't implode while i was away
[2022-12-09 00:06:26] <%Katsundere> that's the good feel moon2LEWD accidental measurements

[2022-12-09 00:07:41] <wzrdn> it won't let you lay a bunch of plans and then erase the parts you don't like? it was working for me with walls and stuff
[2022-12-09 00:08:26] <wzrdn> I hope they let people do UX mods
[2022-12-09 00:08:49] <wzrdn> gotta imagine the code is absolutely unreadable though this project is like 30 years old or something
[2022-12-09 00:09:31] <%Lakart> @wzrdn 30 years by the same two devs tho
[2022-12-09 00:09:38] <%Lakart> and it released with steam workshop compatibility on day 1
[2022-12-09 00:09:49] <$Keyhall> ModLove
[2022-12-09 00:11:05] <wzrdn> my understanding is whats accessible to steam workshop devs is sprite swaps
[2022-12-09 00:11:09] <lordcdm> Kitfox said sprite swaps at first, but that Toady is planning on expanding workshop support so stuff like Dwarf Therapist can come over
[2022-12-09 00:11:37] <wzrdn> the mods for the original game are so bananas they read like packed binary structures in live memory
[2022-12-09 00:11:40] <koaxkoax> !please
[2022-12-09 00:11:40] <@^Moobot> @koaxkoax Please don't spoil anything. Richard is a whiner and wants to work it out for himself. Just sit back and enjoy the Dick Hammer show.
[2022-12-09 00:11:57] <%Lakart> infinite doors order since day 1 richLUL
[2022-12-09 00:15:32] <+Azawrath> we know the menu sucks to navigate so we'll just pause the game so you cna do it
[2022-12-09 00:15:36] <+sometinspecial> @Richard_Hammer how are u like it? been watching on and off for 2 days and havent heard an official opinion
[2022-12-09 00:16:16] <%Lakart> "I never doubted it" - Man who repeatedly doubted it in the last month before release richLUL
[2022-12-09 00:16:41] <wzrdn> it's just got a lot more ... stuff than rimworld

[2022-12-09 00:16:51] <Kennyskill> what kind of enemies can happen in df?
[2022-12-09 00:17:21] <PlaceboSaggins> like me
[2022-12-09 00:17:24] <%+Usinji> @Kennyskill All of them lol.
[2022-12-09 00:17:25] <%Lakart> @Kennyskill animals, hybrids, monsters, werewolves, vampires, elder gods, dragons, other races, necromancers, the undead, etc
[2022-12-09 00:17:26] <+Suffoice> @Kennyskill i think 'any' is the only correct answer
[2022-12-09 00:17:34] <%$chickenwittagun> Kink unlocked
[2022-12-09 00:17:38] <%+pargrok> Let him do him Lakart! @Lakart

[2022-12-09 00:18:08] <Kennyskill> @Lakart thanks
[2022-12-09 00:18:16] <%Katsundere> chert richHoggers
[2022-12-09 00:19:25] <wzrdn> having layers and surfaces and stuff is a big deal over the complete flatness of rimworld etc as well
[2022-12-09 00:19:48] <wzrdn> my only BIG complaint about steam version is no cloud saves. pleaaaase
[2022-12-09 00:20:30] <%Lakart> *cough* [->X ] button next to your minimap *cough*
[2022-12-09 00:20:56] <!$SinisterHumanoid> Layers are cool
[2022-12-09 00:21:00] <%Lakart> The biggest thing layers adds for me is...fall damage
[2022-12-09 00:21:03] <%Lakart> And the ability to fall
[2022-12-09 00:21:08] <!$SinisterHumanoid> It's why onions taste so good, all them layersszx
[2022-12-09 00:21:12] <wzrdn> layers is cool to me cause you don't have to spend time route optimizing. you just build staircase as the hub and you can scale out way farther without worrying about having to reorg 100% of your compound
[2022-12-09 00:22:40] <wzrdn> bedrooooom macros
[2022-12-09 00:23:03] <%$Weeeluu> i think layers helps big time with lag and load on comp. since any layer your not on is un rendered
[2022-12-09 00:23:10] <%+Usinji> I encountered a enemy that was so frustrating I had to abandon the fort. Not because of death but because we couldn't complete any activity. I felt softlocked lol.
[2022-12-09 00:23:29] <malfiory> SMASH that confirm button
[2022-12-09 00:23:45] <%+Carnith> all of your dwarf apartments are really fancy. 2 full rooms AND get the reminder of that they will die.

[2022-12-09 00:27:15] <ReformingOne> "thats too much work" sounds like a death mantra in dwarf fortress just from having watched you play so far LUL
[2022-12-09 00:27:40] <TreamX> Won't someone please think of the children
[2022-12-09 00:27:41] <Sh1ppy> Eh if a few children go missing, that just reduces mouths to feed

[2022-12-09 01:07:27] <Ratsult22> was fine for things like making a bedroom zone from a bed, but if you needed an office how would you know you needed to put down a chair first?

[2022-12-09 05:06:36] <%+pargrok> Yugio was better then pokemon and thats bad
[2022-12-09 05:06:49] <+Nightmareblaze> Chainsaw man is anime.
[2022-12-09 05:06:51] <%+broitsbryan89> I've been watching One Piece. Only on episode 10

[2022-12-09 05:07:15] <+Nightmareblaze> Yugio was better then Pokémon imo
[2022-12-09 05:07:40] <%TheOriginalFelord> one piece, the more overhyped worst paced garbage heap
[2022-12-09 05:07:40] <%Svengineer> one punch man has 300 episodes?
[2022-12-09 05:07:41] <%Anandil> just 100hrs, no problem
[2022-12-09 05:07:43] <Ruinkind> I suppose it would make the highs that much better.  LUL
[2022-12-09 05:07:48] <%+broitsbryan89> I didn't mind the beginning of One Piece but it does get much better

[2022-12-09 05:07:59] <@%BranLan> I just look at wiki's to find out what the hell is happening in one piece. I don't have 3 years to watch that
[2022-12-09 05:08:05] <MelMan2002> one anime man
[2022-12-09 05:08:08] <RatTheUnloved> One Punch Man is honestly pretty good, and I am not an anime enjoyer.
[2022-12-09 05:08:25] <styyygian> i too dig through wikis to understand one piece
[2022-12-09 05:08:33] <%Oeskathine> one piece would be  better if they actually did what Naruto did and just do a ahit ton of filler to let the Manga get further away than just 10 chapters
[2022-12-09 05:08:35] <styyygian> and dbz
[2022-12-09 05:08:45] <%+pargrok> why is there always idolization of getting with a teenage girl in most anime
[2022-12-09 05:08:45] <%+broitsbryan89> One piece is not hard to unsderstand
[2022-12-09 05:08:50] <0zymandeus> Do you lose efficiency by assigning bedrooms like that? i thought it was better to designate them individually for some reason
[2022-12-09 05:09:04] <%+broitsbryan89> hes a pirate and wants to be king of pirates
[2022-12-09 05:09:20] <%Anandil> one piece is not hard to understand, is just that sometimes you need to remember the characters that appeared 15 years ago
[2022-12-09 05:10:04] <styyygian> its hard to understand if you dont watch it
[2022-12-09 05:10:23] <0zymandeus> why do you have so many cats lol
[2022-12-09 05:10:25] <jerome_moonwalker> what's with all the cats?

[2022-12-09 05:59:57] <Rizs_> for all the hotkeys in this game, it blows my mind there is no hotkeys for zones
[2022-12-09 06:00:01] <Rizs_> unless im missing something
[2022-12-09 06:00:35] <Hellbear88> proby a mod for it
[2022-12-09 06:00:53] <Rizs_> you might be able to make a custom hotkey i guess, havent tried that
[2022-12-09 06:00:54] <Hellbear88> theres already mods is what i mean
[2022-12-09 06:01:00] <$killerdeath12321> that sounds annoying

[2022-12-09 06:01:03] <Bujeebus> I wish placing a work order still had a hotkey, its annoying to click on the menu you use so much
[2022-12-09 06:01:33] <Hellbear88> Zork?
[2022-12-09 06:01:37] <Smewkie> I would definitely miss the old hotkeys..

[2022-12-09 06:06:11] <+CptC4rrot> I remember when you died you respawned in the Temple of Midgard and had to go look for your corpse to get your stuff back
[2022-12-09 06:06:19] <Smewkie> hell, even simple stuff like, "That' guys got a spear!" "that's a naginata man"
[2022-12-09 06:07:20] <%$AngryWayneGretzki> I think its taking in its aeromatics then drinking it
[2022-12-09 06:08:38] <$Reductive_Reasoning> Cat population looking kinda scary

[2022-12-09 06:24:32] <%DazedClockwork> Merriment is forbidden.
[2022-12-09 06:24:42] <IrateInitiate> No, more bards!
[2022-12-09 06:25:02] <+painter42> What is this bard town Kappa

[2022-12-09 06:26:16] <PompousAss> is anyone even able to spoil this game haha
[2022-12-09 06:26:21] <+DAVIDBOWlE> I remember Dink being asked if he'd play DF many years ago and he said "hell no that shit is for DnD nerd boys" and then he lit up a cigarette and blew the smoke into the camera
[2022-12-09 06:26:42] <PompousAss> oh i thought you played the og
[2022-12-09 06:26:42] <+ThatSl1me> lol

[2022-12-09 06:27:38] <%rty275> this music fucks
[2022-12-09 06:27:39] <%TheOriginalFelord> had to check every tab to wonder where that music was comming from
[2022-12-09 06:27:53] <+Thrawn20> the music is surprisingly good.
[2022-12-09 06:27:56] <%TheOriginalFelord> banger
[2022-12-09 06:28:07] <IrateInitiate> seeing the matrix was overrated, the CPU draw was the same with a spritepack and it still wasn't worth running above 800x600
[2022-12-09 06:28:36] <%DazedClockwork> And to think he said no to more bards.
[2022-12-09 06:28:41] <NullSignal> this music is very "obscure weekend festival in the mountains"
[2022-12-09 06:28:50] <%TheOriginalFelord> I was on the fence about buying it
[2022-12-09 06:28:52] <%TheOriginalFelord> not anymore
[2022-12-09 06:28:55] <NullSignal> i feel like im at the cornbread festival
[2022-12-09 06:29:20] <+painter42> Is that fish in that pond ?
[2022-12-09 06:29:20] <%+Yamamushi> are barrels consumed when they drink from them?
[2022-12-09 06:29:29] <IrateInitiate> yo if someone told me there was a cornbread festival a 40-minute drive away into the mountains I'd be in the car already
[2022-12-09 06:30:02] <Smewkie> Soap!
[2022-12-09 06:30:11] <NullSignal> @IrateInitiate well, it's true for me. i don't remember when it happens, though
[2022-12-09 06:30:17] <NullSignal> it's awesome

[2022-12-09 06:51:06] <+Danger_Noodle_Gorgalog> I think at the moment there is a glitch where plants don't show visually until their fully grown and at that point your dwarfs usually harvest them
[2022-12-09 06:51:10] <%Shamasu> I feel like I had the same issue
[2022-12-09 06:51:26] <+CheeseClothh> I’d eat your seed
[2022-12-09 06:51:28] <%rty275> its dwarf fortress, there's probably a reason for it
[2022-12-09 06:51:54] <Issoara> no seeds seems to just mean that there's none in storage
[2022-12-09 06:52:13] <+ThatSl1me> wonder whats happening to the plants once they are grown
[2022-12-09 06:52:14] <Issoara> my dwarfs will plant and then it'll show no seeds when they're done
[2022-12-09 06:52:31] <runtimecmd> Wassup chat dick
[2022-12-09 06:53:11] <Issoara> to get seeds back you probably want to make sure most of the plants are going into brewing, since that has a chance to give you seeds back for sure. Dunno if cooking does in this version but it didn't used to
[2022-12-09 06:53:17] <%rty275> no good way to see(d)
[2022-12-09 06:53:18] <runtimecmd> succeed and seeing seeds
[2022-12-09 06:53:31] <tipereth6> !please
[2022-12-09 06:53:31] <@^Moobot> @tipereth6 Please don't spoil anything. Richard is a whiner and wants to work it out for himself. Just sit back and enjoy the Dick Hammer show.
