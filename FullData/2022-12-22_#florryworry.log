They won't attack unless the singular attacking stack is strong enough but once the battle is started they will all pile in instantly.

[2022-12-22 15:23:13] <%CaptainAlex1701> @Shiny59 it seems to work for defence though. None of their stacks is afraid of Florry because they know their friends are around and that together they are stronger. So I really wonder why it does not work in offence.

[2022-12-22 15:27:13] <%CaptainAlex1701> @Shiny59 not sure if it's that hard to fix though. I think it's different for vassals, they will be bold when you are around and happily suicide into bigger stacks because they think you'll help. If they would implement the same logic for allies they would definitely attack Florry now.

[2022-12-22 15:27:35] <Shiny59> @ThrillerOfAutumn yeah, but this kind of happens already, as sometimes you see small 10k stacks just suicide into florry's 60k stack and it doesn't seem like good AI it just seems like bad AI

[2022-12-22 15:28:52] <Shiny59> @CaptainAlex1701 as far as my personal experience, this hasn't been the case. I've had 9k stacks of vassals scared to attack 10k stacks of rebels when i have 40k troops standing right there to help
