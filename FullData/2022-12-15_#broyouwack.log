[2022-12-15 22:21:28] <@^Nightbot> Drops ARE NOT broken, it just doesn’t show the drops menu on mobile at the moment. You ARE getting percentage towards completing your drops, it just doesn’t show the progress on your screen if you’re on mobile. But you will receive it. If you have any questions, please ask Google  :)

You ARE getting percentage towards completing your drops, it just doesn’t show the progress on your screen if you’re on mobile. But you will receive it. If you have any questions, please ask Google  :)

You ARE getting percentage towards completing your drops, it just doesn’t show the progress on your screen if you’re on mobile. But you will receive it. If you have any questions, please ask Google  :)
