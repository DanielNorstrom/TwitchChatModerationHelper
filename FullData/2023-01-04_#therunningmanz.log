[2023-01-04 17:41:14] <intrikurt> @static_skis It's not the same ammo, the SVD ammo is more powerful, and the SVD has a longer barrel so does more damage
[2023-01-04 17:41:17] <%+Nivarias> is this the vanilla day/night cycle with 2 hour days and 1 hour nights
[2023-01-04 17:41:19] <%TheZigorkyBarKid> @static_skis The sks is 7.62x39 and the svd is 7.62x54, so they are completely different

[2023-01-04 21:09:36] <Bombdog1244> I think the new airfield is far superior tho. Feels like much more of a risk for the better gear.
[2023-01-04 21:09:39] <%+Jay_Grand> @therunningmanz could try for surgical gloves as well and chance the gas zone if not lucky? What do you think

[2023-01-04 21:11:43] <+brewsick2> when did they change the Air field initiallly?
[2023-01-04 21:11:44] <specht_knuprecht> I take this as a no :D

[2023-01-04 21:12:10] <King_James_777> if they add a bunker to Chernarus imo I feel like west evac is the place
[2023-01-04 21:12:18] <+getpeeweed> For some reason i find it interesting where you decide to put your loot  ha
[2023-01-04 21:12:22] <%+Toilet_Water> There is that bunker door at Tisy

[2023-01-04 21:12:29] <%hyperpro8> @gavowen87 tge field radio picks up gand held devices and field devices, they are compatible with each other, the only difference is the field radio has a bigger range

[2023-01-04 21:12:32] <%$Zulu_Six> Airfield will be cool with less buildings but a new bunker system
[2023-01-04 21:12:35] <King_James_777> or like the mountains around there
[2023-01-04 21:12:48] <%+crispyrounds> Open up the mines

[2023-01-04 23:28:54] <%$twitchy_noob> How long does a full filter last?
[2023-01-04 23:28:55] <cootasha> room down stairs under walk way
[2023-01-04 23:28:56] <+dirtyplunger_> this loot is a letdown
[2023-01-04 23:28:57] <%+ukwildcats> place doesn't have shit for loot
[2023-01-04 23:29:01] <@%Unclefood> @Xeo_Wulf The really worry is any  one of your clothes getting ruined, you'd start taking poison damage and bleeding
[2023-01-04 23:29:09] <%+metabollock> That's exactly how I sound first thing in the morning..COPD Asthma etc ..Don't smoke kids

[2023-01-04 23:29:14] <+SirJimiee> loot is wank
[2023-01-04 23:29:17] <%+urmomslollipopsucka> the loot there as far as military is nil
[2023-01-04 23:29:19] <adzz177> are random gas zones (the ones you can hear like heli crashes) worth looting?
[2023-01-04 23:29:22] <%+firedingo1> does it make a difference how long it last based on how much you sprint?
[2023-01-04 23:29:32] <dzrlo> ever done a gaz zone in the dark?
[2023-01-04 23:29:36] <awesomejonas> his friend is dead? missed 10 minutes..

[2023-01-04 23:30:04] <%trugongsu> Pox grenades last too long to me
[2023-01-04 23:30:05] <%+Xeo_Wulf> @Unclefood Ah crap, that's not how you want to go is it?! I bet that's horrific

[2023-01-04 23:30:10] <BenQQu> @Unclefood he was talking about the mod where you become a zombie when you die
[2023-01-04 23:30:10] <%$twitchy_noob> Head to the gas zone today and get your free 911!!! Today only!
[2023-01-04 23:30:15] <+SirPsychoBerg> @firedingo1 the filter? no
[2023-01-04 23:30:15] <$alonzinator> bring back all the 19-11 and let vrined have first choice?
[2023-01-04 23:30:20] <$idealbicycle741> you can run in and get the pox nade just after it lifts
[2023-01-04 23:30:38] <%+zillerrages> I think it's like project zomboid you don't get to control it but your carcass walks around
[2023-01-04 23:30:38] <BenQQu> @Unclefood Weirdly aggro
[2023-01-04 23:30:41] <Axelbuddy> turning into a zombie doesn't fit the lore if I understand it correctly.
[2023-01-04 23:30:42] <%$twitchy_noob> I cant hip fire for shit!

[2023-01-04 23:31:06] <%TomEmilioDavies> This is all just the loot you would find here before it was a gas zone.
[2023-01-04 23:31:07] <%+firedingo1> @firedingo1 thx
[2023-01-04 23:31:07] <clesteven> Do the pox grenades work against zombies?
[2023-01-04 23:31:08] <+lumpen101> *crates
[2023-01-04 23:31:14] <King_James_777> I know you can get some good stuff here but still seems like its the same tiered stuff
[2023-01-04 23:31:15] <%jambodia12> can you get punch cards from here?
[2023-01-04 23:31:22] <+Rik_g> Do you feel like this area has been looted already recently?
[2023-01-04 23:31:23] <@%Unclefood> @BenQQu It's just important to @ the person you're responding to rather than just saying "It's a mod"
[2023-01-04 23:31:23] <%Ars_Starhawk> this loot is tragic
[2023-01-04 23:31:26] <%$twitchy_noob> Fuck me dead

[2023-01-04 23:31:34] <+spandy> so frustrating that the loot is this way. like what's the point
[2023-01-04 23:31:34] <+Zpitty> You guys think there have been many gunfights between two full nbc'd people in gas zones? More or less than 50 all time?
[2023-01-04 23:31:35] <xpsychic_spreex> are you carrying on with this character tomorrow? and when i went here i got nothing but 2 m4s

[2023-01-04 23:32:24] <%$twitchy_noob> This loot is vanilla as fuck!
[2023-01-04 23:32:29] <%$IZH_Rifle> Radunin is typically better but it's such a large area
[2023-01-04 23:32:38] <%typical_slacker> I saw AmishZed do this same gas zone and didn't find shit either
[2023-01-04 23:32:40] <%+galasteve> @idealbicycle741 yeah.  I found a shitload of pox (like 5) in dolina.  By the well after a random gas attack
[2023-01-04 23:32:43] <%and1chunner> Did your good friend leave or just wait for you outside the gas?
[2023-01-04 23:32:45] <Tueniuan> imagine stepping on a landmine here
[2023-01-04 23:32:46] <dxbsy> Average vanilla loot

[2023-01-04 23:41:05] <%winniez84> is m4 only better as its more customizable
