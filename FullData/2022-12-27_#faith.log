[2022-12-27 15:58:01] <%JayZhuang> very like you!^^
[2022-12-27 15:58:05] <Game_Rebel> any of the "insane" deals on black friday now... are special models made just for BF that are cut-down versions of the regular item, meant to have "most" of the same specs, but missing key things that add cost.

[2022-12-27 17:51:37] <@%Parkanian1> nothing about what this person did is acceptable, and not-just to you. This isn't just "your personal boundaries" stuff, this is "any reasonable person's boundaries" stuff. I'm glad you had friends with you.
[2022-12-27 17:51:41] <villibond> never ever tell people where you live,   .... not a good idea to even have your real birthday on FakeBook  or online,  what is the name of this Twithcom getogether Twitchcon?  It would be fine for gamers,  but ....anyway, I gotta go.  Loved the Christmas outfit.
[2022-12-27 17:51:50] <%R6_Tempest> Sounds like Carl would get an Olympic Gold for Overstepping

[2022-12-27 18:28:27] <SlicVic518> Interacting with any human being there has to be a conscience line of personal space and perspective.
[2022-12-27 18:28:30] <%itzyella> so talking to someone you like is way different than every other human being if you just cant remember how to act (lose their shyt) when you are around them

[2022-12-27 18:29:19] <+KarsaOorlong> It sucks bc the behavior you are talking about is hurtful because it is dehumanizing. It treats people like an object and removes their agency. And the subject of that will never find it attractive to be dehumanized.
[2022-12-27 18:29:23] <%PocoyoDidNothingWrong> Well maybe they don't know, doesn't mean that they are not accountable but there's a lot of cognitive disorders that make it hard to realize it's a boundary

[2022-12-27 19:29:08] <villibond> Guys, easiest way to find a nice woman is to develop a personality.  If this is too difiicult, well then workout til woman follow you around.   Or you can make a lot of money and pay ... anyway.  Go to meetUp and you can find people who have the same intersts as you.  It's not a dating site but it's a good place to find people who resonate with you.
