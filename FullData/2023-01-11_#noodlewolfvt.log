[2023-01-11 00:13:12] <thatonebean770> STEP 1 Mix 500g strong white flour, 2 tsp salt and a 7g sachet of fast-action yeast in a large bowl.  STEP 2 Make a well in the centre, then add 3 tbsp olive oil and 300ml water, and mix well. If the dough seems a little stiff, add another 1-2 tbsp water and mix well.  STEP 3 Tip onto a lightly floured work surface and knead for around 10 mins.

[2023-01-11 00:35:59] <drkRoss89> @Dio444777 It depends on your budget. If you can find a decent suit/menswear shop, I recommend starting there.

[2023-01-11 00:36:21] <%TheOfficalPizza> it would be the funniest shit
[2023-01-11 00:36:23] <%arc237> @dio444777 to put it easy for you, ask her to make you an outfit for the wedding so you know for sure what to wear
[2023-01-11 00:36:25] <%$Dio444777> she told me not to spend too much but i'd like to have a nice suit. never really worn one before
[2023-01-11 00:36:45] <%TheOfficalPizza> you can always rent a suit as well

[2023-01-11 00:37:28] <drkRoss89> Best case scenario is a proper tailored suit, but that option is expensive. On the other hand, it's tailor-made to your body.  If you can rent one out that's made to measure, it's all good @Dio444777

[2023-01-11 02:02:38] <Grimmferno> fun fact: the spiral on Poliwag/Poliwhirl/Poliwrath's belly is a reference to how tadpoles intestines are arranged in a spiral and can be seen as their bellies are slightly transparent

[2023-01-11 02:02:44] <%Naliina> By pampering I imagined you spend a day being pampered. Like you stay comfortable and are being taken care of.
