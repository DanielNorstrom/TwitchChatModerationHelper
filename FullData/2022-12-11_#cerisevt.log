[2022-12-11 10:07:23] <%KaitoOnTheClock> How hard is this game to get in to yokaiHmm Seen a lot of friends play it but I've barely seen gameplay
[2022-12-11 10:07:32] <%$Memil03> xD
[2022-12-11 10:07:44] <mcfishlicka> Khatep's campaign is kind of regarded as... not good

[2022-12-11 10:08:04] <%+khMagnus2010> Khatep has a rough start
[2022-12-11 10:08:10] <mcfishlicka> Its due to his start position. He's in a very cramped and hostile place
[2022-12-11 10:08:29] <%+khMagnus2010> so you dont get any chance to confederate as tomb kings, so be aware of that

[2022-12-11 10:08:48] <%$Memil03> she is ok i would say a bit hard with Kora guar other wize fine i think
[2022-12-11 10:08:50] <%shadowicedevil> @KaitoOnTheClock as long as they already got rid of the fact you need to buy the first 2 games to play immortal empires then its fine as long as your alright with playing the base game factions with the non dlc lords
[2022-12-11 10:09:33] <mcfishlicka> The other games go on sale relatively often at least
[2022-12-11 10:09:34] <%$Memil03> Kroq-Gar*
[2022-12-11 10:09:36] <%+khMagnus2010> if you can get past the early game as tomb kings the rest is usally easy. your armies are free upkeep, but high tier units are limited in amount you can recruit
[2022-12-11 10:09:49] <%KaitoOnTheClock> @KaitoOnTheClock Wait. You need to buy 3 games total?
[2022-12-11 10:09:55] <%+khMagnus2010> you also have limited army cap, but you can increase with tech
[2022-12-11 10:10:16] <%+khMagnus2010> you can only play the races you own

[2022-12-11 10:10:33] <%$Memil03> @KaitoOnTheClock Mm warhammer 3 is prob the best game to start with tho with a more or less totorial
[2022-12-11 10:10:39] <%+khMagnus2010> you need all 3 + race DLC to play all the races in TWW3
[2022-12-11 10:10:54] <%+pocketswithagun> warhammer more like borehammer  (this post by someone who has nearly 11k points on models in 8 armies
[2022-12-11 10:10:59] <%shadowicedevil> @KaitoOnTheClock the last time i checked you needed to buy them to play immortal empires yeah though i dont know if they got rid of that requirement so you might want to check up on that

[2022-12-11 10:12:29] <%+khMagnus2010> you want ones that will benefit early units or economy early on
[2022-12-11 10:12:29] <mcfishlicka> Not really, I think you're meant to pick and choose based on your preferences

[2022-12-11 10:12:52] <%$Memil03> i tend to start witht the first one i think yokaiHmm
[2022-12-11 10:13:06] <%+khMagnus2010> check the related tech. some of them are geared towards late game units, so those dynasties arent as good early on
[2022-12-11 10:13:06] <%KaitoOnTheClock> @KaitoOnTheClock yokaiYes Thanks for the tips!
[2022-12-11 10:13:29] <$sircool099> each dynasty typically focuses on a certain playstyle, so look over which ones you can get to find your first preference

[2022-12-11 10:15:04] <%+khMagnus2010> oh, most of the tomb king capitals to your west have pyramid landmarks. they are all pretty good and give great bonuses
[2022-12-11 10:15:05] <$sircool099> the best thing about the tomb-kings is that you can lose an entire army, and in like 3 turns it's fully back no cost. losing a city hurts WAY MORE though
[2022-12-11 10:15:12] <%+giatzu666> btw cerise do you like the warhammer lore too or do you just like gameplay of those games ?

[2022-12-11 10:17:44] <%+jjmoxk> crusader kings is maybe more complicated. but maybe more sensible lol like civ 6 has rules for the sake of rules and ck has historically realistic rules
[2022-12-11 10:18:09] <$sircool099> SETTRA DOES NOT SERVE. SETTRA DOes not get many people to play tennis with.

[2022-12-11 10:23:15] <$sircool099> tomb kings are all about "Awakening" an empire, not making one. it's why they were the first 0 maintenance for army units faction, cause you're just dusting off things and sending it out.

[2022-12-11 10:42:44] <%Synesh> Birds and flying units don't have too much mass, so they can struggle to get out of fights.
[2022-12-11 10:42:47] <%+GeneralRhea> I recommend splitting up your Merle units in the frontline. Right now you have your high attackers on one flank and the high defense on the other, which can (in general) lead to uneven battle lines. That can lead to units being broken and the line being flanked
[2022-12-11 10:42:49] <%Synesh> Unless it's monsters
[2022-12-11 10:43:24] <%$Memil03> she is a fighter tho so she might be fine

[2022-12-11 10:45:09] <%Synesh> Khalida has a grudge against the vampires that makes the dwarf blush.
[2022-12-11 10:45:11] <eilamos> how vempiers in the middle of the day??????
[2022-12-11 10:45:23] <%$Memil03> can u click on chalida and hold your mouce over the green eye thingy ablility?
[2022-12-11 10:45:47] <%+GeneralRhea> For example your dual sword infantry are pretty bad in prolonged combat. So you would want them on the flanks to wrap around your enemy and flank them for quick and hard attacks
[2022-12-11 10:46:03] <%Synesh> There is a rule in the Warhammer rpg to make vampire for campaigns. One of their special powers can be resistence to sunlight.
[2022-12-11 10:46:04] <%$Memil03> Under her stats their is a tiny icon

[2022-12-11 10:48:32] <+FinalCipher> there's no 'wrong' way to build khalida but using her to buff ranged units is very strong, especially when you get sepulchral stalkers (the snake guys with halberds)

[2022-12-11 10:49:51] <+FinalCipher> yeah 'blessing of asaph' makes any ranged unit near her more powerful, so you can pop her by your artillery, your ranged units, etc
[2022-12-11 10:50:00] <%$Memil03> mhmm
[2022-12-11 10:50:06] <%Synesh> It affects also artillery. So that includes the casket

[2022-12-11 10:51:16] <+FinalCipher> archers are a great thing to use against vamp counts because they have no archers themselves, so if you can hold them at arm's length khalida can really bully them

[2022-12-11 11:01:04] <%Synesh> Your problem here will be only the grave guard. The rest is not bad. But the Tomb Guard should handle them.
[2022-12-11 11:01:10] <+FinalCipher> if you can take out the towers, none of their defenders will be able to shoot you and you can sit back and watch the enemy melt
[2022-12-11 11:01:49] <+FinalCipher> yeah they've only got 2 towers on the end there, so it's not too hard to disable their defences
[2022-12-11 11:01:52] <%$Memil03> mm shoot those to towers and then just use the range and kill and when u dont have any more ammo then go into mele
[2022-12-11 11:02:29] <%$Memil03> he dosent have any range after all

[2022-12-11 11:13:36] <%Synesh> They don't have high melee attack. But make it up with their Bonush vs Infantry. And  then your spells can help them more.
[2022-12-11 11:13:36] <%shadowicedevil> i do love the ushabti their animations are just so cool

[2022-12-11 11:19:59] <%shadowicedevil> @KaitoOnTheClock i believe there are around 280 factions its just about 70-100 of them usually get destroyed in like the first 5 turns

[2022-12-11 11:21:46] <%shadowicedevil> yeah its annoying for new players to get into the game for that reason
[2022-12-11 11:21:51] <%$Memil03> INDEED!
[2022-12-11 11:21:52] <+FinalCipher> i wouldn't mind the small settlement battles if they just changed them a little

[2022-12-11 11:22:44] <+FinalCipher> personally i would have separated towers from supply points, and had it so you have x tower points that can only be spent at the start of a battle
[2022-12-11 11:22:51] <+FinalCipher> with supply points only being for barricades
[2022-12-11 11:23:03] <%Synesh> You could unlock the mage.
[2022-12-11 11:24:09] <%$Memil03> Ceri is going no magic run here xD
[2022-12-11 11:24:14] <%Synesh> You should try Steel Faith Overhaul mod Cipher. It removes the supply points gain during battle.
[2022-12-11 11:24:30] <%Synesh> Also is overhauls the game to be closer to table top
[2022-12-11 11:24:39] <%$Memil03> and he runs
[2022-12-11 11:24:40] <%$Irrigatio> there is loads of mod that do that only without overhauling everything else

[2022-12-11 11:31:55] <%Synesh> Most chariots in the game are 3 - 4 units. Tomb kings are 10-12. But not too tough
[2022-12-11 11:32:16] <+FinalCipher> yeah the necrotects were pretty infamously mean-spirited even when they were alive

[2022-12-11 11:33:58] <spriggan_one> Tomb Kings vs dwarfs is a pain for the kings early. And a slaughter for the dwarfs later
[2022-12-11 11:34:20] <%Synesh> @spriggan_one True, but then again. Trollhammer torpedoes are a thing.
[2022-12-11 11:34:29] <%$Irrigatio> possibly a mod ye - though it is weird to me that a military ally would not just give you the book

[2022-12-11 11:34:31] <+FinalCipher> here's my fun summary of khalida lore: she was pretty sure her cousin neferata was a vampire, who baited her into a duel hoping to assassinate her to cover her tracks. neferata got a whiff of khalida's blood during the duel and went full vamp mode, biting her neck. she freaked out and decided to try to turn khalida into a vampire by giving her the Blood Kiss (a kiss but with spooky vampire powers involved)

[2022-12-11 11:44:07] <+FinalCipher> but then he got chickens and the crows would try to shoo them to the stream too, because crows couldn't understand the difference between a duck and a chicken

Here’s something for the “coffin”.”  Cerise smiles and rolls her eyes at the bad joke. Cheer100

[2022-12-11 12:59:35] <%+Nry_Chan> Basically, ceri asked for twitch integration in df, but since DF uses it's own engine, the usual dll modding route like rimworld won't work, and the way modding works in DF is a bunch of text files without internet access or anything

[2022-12-11 13:00:00] <%+Nry_Chan> So my approach will be to make an external tool that will just write those text files instead
