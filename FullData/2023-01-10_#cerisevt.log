[2023-01-10 12:20:14] <!HawoooBakeinu> FIRST OFF. You max out the red unhappiness bar.

[2023-01-10 12:20:41] <!HawoooBakeinu> Next you abuse the event that ppl are angry. And drop the unhappiness below the threshold. Keeping that raises hope. LUL Rinse and repeat.
[2023-01-10 12:21:21] <!HawoooBakeinu> Aka just spamming emergency shifts to make them angry hawuuSmug2
[2023-01-10 12:21:45] <Nashikage> I never see the point of a house of pleasure. If you got enough free time to prostitute yourself you have enough free time to be working in the coal mine so you don't freeze to death.
[2023-01-10 12:21:55] <!HawoooBakeinu> It's fine yuniiLOL
[2023-01-10 12:22:16] <ProDavid_69> you can also toggle extended shifts extensively and instantly go up and down
[2023-01-10 12:22:18] <!HawoooBakeinu> I wouldnt recommend that method anyway. Unless you're playing on HARD mode or higher. Because it is literally a last ditch effort to avoid getting evicted.

[2023-01-10 12:33:20] <Graknorke> also you could argue it's an efficiency thing. they could burn coal in their own homes but the amount it would take to survive in -30 is so much it wouldn't be worth it
[2023-01-10 12:33:34] <mr_saha_the_third> why did these people build their city in a giant hole,  wouldn't it better be in a flat surface 🤔
[2023-01-10 12:33:43] <!Skarbimir> @sircool099 it is called Frostpunk because the weather is frost and the people are punks, yes-yes KEKW

[2023-01-10 12:35:26] <!HawoooBakeinu> @mr_saha_the_third Remember the main scenario. The storm reached -150 °C. And that INSIDE the crater. Outside it was so cold anything alive that didnt find shelter immediately died.
[2023-01-10 12:36:16] <%$Memil03> Should the hope meter be full or emty?
[2023-01-10 12:36:21] <!HawoooBakeinu> So the idea behind the generator being placed inside a crater is actually quite a good one. You place a giant heater and the heat gets reflected back inside by the walls. Making the air breathable
[2023-01-10 12:36:27] <!Skarbimir> @Memil03 full
[2023-01-10 12:36:29] <mr_saha_the_third> ah yeah, I just remembered,  which mean they really need to start making walls

[2023-01-10 13:45:14] <!HawoooBakeinu> Because the engineers building this generator lost their cargo and not everything could be found again they had to cut corners building it. And that's causing it to fall apart now.
[2023-01-10 13:45:38] <!HawoooBakeinu> Every decision in this scenario has lasting consequences.

[2023-01-10 13:47:27] <!HawoooBakeinu> So yeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah. The former ruler of this city. He noticed something was wrong with the generator but he wanted to be a sun king, yes?
[2023-01-10 13:47:54] <%Spitalier> There is soup and there is soup. I think without access to spices and other tasty stuff, soup will boil down to water with fat in it.
[2023-01-10 13:47:58] <Zobota> Isnt it just warmer to live underground?
[2023-01-10 13:48:06] <!HawoooBakeinu> So he shut away the engineers who wanted to try fixing it as it may have endangered his position of power. Making it deteriorate to the point it turned irreparable.
[2023-01-10 13:48:38] <!HawoooBakeinu> And the repeated outages enraged the people enough to stage a rebellion and put down that self-declared sun king of a captain.

[2023-01-10 13:55:21] <!HawoooBakeinu> Oh right I forgot. While the generator is offline automatons cannot work either. They got a battery charge and cannot recharge on the steam hubs anymore.
[2023-01-10 13:55:29] <verajonson> so this was supposed to happen i mean this is programmed into the game right?
[2023-01-10 13:55:37] <!HawoooBakeinu> @verajonson Yes.
