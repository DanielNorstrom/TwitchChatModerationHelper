[2022-12-24 01:13:01] <%+MarMar0326> Looks like we might have word on a Bloodborne PC port soon if there is one coming. Apparently, in an FTC filing, Microsoft cited BloodBorne as an example of Sony holding third party games hostage from other platforms. The easiest defense on Sony’s part would be to drop an announcement. So, I’m holding on to that copium.

[2022-12-24 01:44:25] <%$Poledra_Val> you should definitely give Bastion a go with Hard Mode in mind at some point

[2022-12-24 03:22:33] <%$jqck_89> would you ever consider a chugging stream
[2022-12-24 03:22:34] <$Aweglib> at least they stopped just leaving the consoles on the floor scgLUL
[2022-12-24 03:22:37] <%waffle_irony> voltage dips do wild things
[2022-12-24 03:22:44] <%$Eomund_01> console using too much juice PeepoJuice
[2022-12-24 03:22:44] <%+beatnik86> cosmic rays
[2022-12-24 03:22:44] <%+darkart800> My favorite GDQ moment is still Barbsouls
[2022-12-24 03:22:46] <%+waggyman23> elden coming out was nearly a year ago already
[2022-12-24 03:22:47] <%$kefkiroth_> They bought it at a garage sale 2hrs before the start time
[2022-12-24 03:22:48] <%Topgun486> is there a reason they don't use a super NT?
[2022-12-24 03:22:50] <%+broxx909> I found you during Mario Maker 2
[2022-12-24 03:22:54] <%AbyssalProx> Me too
[2022-12-24 03:22:55] <%FrothieCoffee> Zeldathon for me
[2022-12-24 03:22:57] <%Mr_Gowen> Stumbled here from a GPB raid during a 24hr stream long ago
[2022-12-24 03:23:00] <%hey_yo_dflo> The energy from the crowd during that GPW2 run seemed crazy. That was a special time for sure
[2022-12-24 03:23:01] <%Hideakikarate> The internet crash was hilarious
[2022-12-24 03:23:01] <%unlimited_JP> bussin
[2022-12-24 03:23:03] <%+Thorn_42> NODDERS
[2022-12-24 03:23:05] <%$MorridHasCoffee> Elden Ring first playthrough hype was unreal
[2022-12-24 03:23:06] <%+iGrowwearyofthisworld> Wish I could Men In Black mind wipe myself and do it again
[2022-12-24 03:23:08] <%+ShotoTodoroki90> NODDERS
[2022-12-24 03:23:08] <%+bucketsAMF> Speaking of Elden Ring, whens the randomizer happening?
[2022-12-24 03:23:08] <ZalbaagBeoulve> happyf33t was pretty cool
[2022-12-24 03:23:09] <%xodingusox> yep would love to play ER for the first time again
[2022-12-24 03:23:09] <%$caddywompus46> or sekiro
[2022-12-24 03:23:10] <%+Misssster_Anderson> I started watching Mario vids on youtube and found you through GPB @BarbarousKing
[2022-12-24 03:23:11] <%Demagus3> and then the next 5 playthroughs in a row
[2022-12-24 03:23:12] <%D3rrtyD4n> i never stopped playing elden ring KEKW
[2022-12-24 03:23:13] <$Wargarbler> I don’t even remember what was happening when I found you…
[2022-12-24 03:23:15] <%$adriana_heartilly> I found Barb because of Mario Party barbLove
[2022-12-24 03:23:17] <%GrandAeon> the awe
[2022-12-24 03:23:18] <%PhallusRequiem> teleport chests
[2022-12-24 03:23:20] <%PanteraHouse> Elden Ring first playthrough was pure magic
[2022-12-24 03:23:21] <%PentaghastN7> Your Sekiro first Playthrough was amazing as well
[2022-12-24 03:23:23] <thegoldendonger> elden ring is on sale atm chat!!
[2022-12-24 03:23:23] <%Dante_Draco> Patty dropped my dumb ass here a year and a half ago, and Barb ain't managed to scare me off yet.
[2022-12-24 03:23:27] <%+XLVIItheRoman> I found Barb when GPW2 came out, and I was trying to figure out who everyone was mad at while they played it
[2022-12-24 03:23:27] <%+williard18> First time in Nokron is amazing
[2022-12-24 03:23:29] <Etiennera> Wouldn't Elden Ring also be much more expensive to make than GoWR?
[2022-12-24 03:23:30] <%$TheMuznick> thanks barb, now I want to go play Elden Ring
[2022-12-24 03:23:30] <%$Zw1ggy> One of my favorite stream moments was the first time you found the underground area
[2022-12-24 03:23:31] <%$kefkiroth_> I was so entrenched in Elden Ring I didnt watch Barbs first playthrough xtraFeels
[2022-12-24 03:23:35] <%+GubDM> stumbling upon siofra river was actually insane
[2022-12-24 03:23:35] <%+CakeBearer> I will always cherish my first play through of elden ring
[2022-12-24 03:23:37] <%$Eomund_01> Carl -> Poo -> Barb
[2022-12-24 03:23:37] <%+GubDM> never forget that
[2022-12-24 03:23:41] <%ecstaticbroccoli> I found you through your LoZ 2 blind playthrough
[2022-12-24 03:23:45] <%phillipj06> i found barb due to carl playing master and commander
[2022-12-24 03:23:45] <%KuroManKuro> Mm1 viewer levels. You immediately dismissed my level and I am such a beta I stuck around.
[2022-12-24 03:23:45] <%D3rrtyD4n> elden ring might be my favorite souls game
[2022-12-24 03:23:46] <%$StandingYon> I found Andy on GDQ, then Poo, then those two helped me find you. now I'm here :)
[2022-12-24 03:23:47] <%+darkart800> @BarbarousKing do you still remember when chat conspired to get Barbsouls as the dark souls file name during GDQ
[2022-12-24 03:23:48] <%$jqck_89> that photo of streamer with poo is real despite what he says. don't believe him chat
[2022-12-24 03:23:48] <Jahusaphat> elden ring was on sale so i finally bought it
[2022-12-24 03:23:50] <Left4Dead1971> pattyPadi

[2022-12-24 03:23:52] <%denvermullets> I just started my first play thru of from soft games
[2022-12-24 03:23:53] <%$hal_____> @Eomund_01 the mario pipeline is real

[2022-12-24 03:23:55] <%+iGrowwearyofthisworld> The transporter chest map reveals and Siofra River are the big ones for me
[2022-12-24 03:23:57] <%xodingusox> for me it was the elevator down into Siofra for the first time
[2022-12-24 03:23:58] <%+Drewge> @Eomund_01 same
[2022-12-24 03:23:59] <%ennuiners> oof
[2022-12-24 03:24:00] <%AbyssalProx> Getting lost in the castle was such an experience
[2022-12-24 03:24:02] <%+QuartzB_> i thought it was bad ass, and then I found the sewer
[2022-12-24 03:24:02] <%spiritdragon756> OUCH
[2022-12-24 03:24:02] <%$adriana_heartilly> Do you recommend Elden Ring if I've never played any of the Dark Souls games?

[2022-12-24 03:24:10] <%+beatnik86> it's so crazy to get blown away by a game in the first few hours, then again 20-30 hours later. that's elden ring for you
[2022-12-24 03:24:10] <%PointBlanche> you became a perma-sub during DS1 rando when you first put on Mario RPG music
[2022-12-24 03:24:11] <%+CakeBearer> I remember getting to morgot thinking that there couldn’t be much left of the game barbLUL

[2022-12-24 03:24:27] <+robbyplease> what about Demon's Souls?
[2022-12-24 03:24:27] <%Dante_Draco> @Misssster_Anderson No shame. They are both fun to watch for different reasons.
[2022-12-24 03:24:29] <ZalbaagBeoulve> gdq is tight. when is that

[2022-12-24 03:24:34] <%$HaveYouGotItYet> if you have no intent to go back to dark souls, then yeah, start with elden ring
[2022-12-24 03:24:36] <%9s_nine> i went from ds3 to ds1 and it was too crusty

[2022-12-24 03:24:42] <%+QuartzB_> if you start with elden ring you never need to go back
[2022-12-24 03:24:44] <%$The_Mammon_Machine> DS1 will also make it less of a difficulty curve going in to ER
[2022-12-24 03:24:45] <%$unknownohyeah> pc demons souls soon COPIUM
[2022-12-24 03:24:53] <%thejumpingmouse> I got into Mario Maker after watching Ceave analyze entropy in mario maker
[2022-12-24 03:24:53] <%+GubDM> the world of DS1 is incomparable among souls games, still
[2022-12-24 03:24:55] <%D3rrtyD4n> elden ring is the most accessible, so if you end up liking those types of games its hard going backwards
[2022-12-24 03:24:55] <%Dante_Draco> Barb is still my only T3 Sub.

[2022-12-24 03:26:52] <%+Beefyfife> @barbarousking what’s your favorite game so far from this 24 hour stream? Was it Into The Breach?
[2022-12-24 03:26:53] <%AbyssalProx> And of course, the final rune was in a cave barb didn't know about

[2022-12-24 05:50:50] <%doubled49> Patty Jenkins directed Wonder Woman 1 and it was good but she wrote WW 1984 and it was terrible.
[2022-12-24 05:50:52] <%PeytonRilke> George Lucas is world builder, he's a shit director though

[2022-12-24 06:55:10] <%$ChicCanyon> this game was very early in the indy scene. i believe the interview was trying to have a gotcha moment. essentially "without large publishers policing content these indies will just mutilate kids." so the dev gave a... lets say pompous defense of the cartoon violence.
[2022-12-24 06:55:13] <%+thathandsomedevil> I don't think they took the mindset of a Kaizo Mario runner into effect when considering the schadenfreude.

[2022-12-24 08:21:20] <%BeatnautLives> I has 32...
[2022-12-24 08:21:24] <%$dotBik> Most games say 16gb since that's super common, but 32 is pretty cheap now
[2022-12-24 08:21:24] <%SxySamurai> The only other game that recommends that much is Star Citizen
[2022-12-24 08:21:26] <%$TheMuznick> other games average 16 i think?

[2022-12-24 08:21:36] <%MMage09> my guess is its just so everything loads so theres no shader compilation shit
[2022-12-24 08:21:37] <banjotheshredder> just change 32

[2022-12-24 08:21:50] <%MadKev> time to move on from the past and get 32gb
[2022-12-24 08:21:53] <%kit05> Elden Ring was 12 GB recommended actually

[2022-12-24 13:35:47] <Notgas> you are a barbarian king after all
[2022-12-24 13:35:47] <brandbool> using guns gives you less points too

[2022-12-24 13:35:48] <%$cinemario> guns are high risk for sure

[2022-12-24 13:36:01] <%archang3l_media> IRL that's why you don't bring a knife to a gunfight... It's unfair advantage
