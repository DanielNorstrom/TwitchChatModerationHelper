[2022-12-07 15:34:10] <stuffnthangss> @k1mjie the hardest things to learn about val as a cs player is how to use the abilities

[2022-12-07 15:34:25] <@%Meemzeh> I'd say Valorant isn't difficult to learn, it's just different - so it takes some time adjusting. Also learning the attacks, abilities takes some time.
[2022-12-07 15:34:32] <scrubLord_val> @k1mjie Mechanics are easy to learn, abilities definitely takes a bit to get used too (not in terms of using them, but learning how others will use them if that makes sense)

[2022-12-07 15:40:04] <mahyrlo> problem with this game and/or CS is not that ppl don't have good aim  but they don't have brain
[2022-12-07 15:40:40] <hass99_> wtf was that chamber doing KEKW
[2022-12-07 15:40:42] <prac1ice> KEKW

[2022-12-07 15:40:53] <+domcruisin> it happens LOL no spray pattern
[2022-12-07 15:40:54] <LDSuperSonic> the guns in this game are something else

[2022-12-07 15:41:36] <hass99_> spraying is the problem just cant spray
[2022-12-07 15:41:38] <n1utv> its much slower then cs
[2022-12-07 15:41:42] <lildice1> rain voice deeper actally
[2022-12-07 15:41:42] <00zie> What all agents have you mained in this game

[2022-12-07 15:42:01] <meeqcs> @SilenFate only diffrence is that you can strafe jump while holding W
[2022-12-07 15:42:36] <meeqcs> and slow down a lot when tagged
[2022-12-07 15:42:38] <9pox> you both gigachads tho, so dont worry bout it @olofmeister
[2022-12-07 15:42:41] <n1utv> u can spray too a certain degree specially with the phantom, with vandal it gets a bit ruffer
[2022-12-07 15:42:42] <arnnnx> Spray and pray

[2022-12-07 15:43:09] <vtk4856> vandal spray is rng past 10 bullets anyway
[2022-12-07 15:43:10] <prac1ice> u cant swing like that in cs
[2022-12-07 15:43:15] <azmeister110> nt
[2022-12-07 15:43:15] <+SilenFate> spraying in this game is not worth it
[2022-12-07 15:43:16] <+domcruisin> ya the spray is a bit wonky definitely tap or 3 burst
[2022-12-07 15:43:19] <stuffnthangss> Phantom is better for spraying in general, vandal is more of a burst/tap gun

[2022-12-07 16:09:44] <indexiWhatr> How do you feel about the spray in Valo? Personally I hate it compared to CS
[2022-12-07 16:10:09] <nicolikeshappymeals> Will you play for roster again?
[2022-12-07 16:10:10] <maxblancoo> "gl in esports" or "diff" what other iconic valo flames are there?
[2022-12-07 16:10:43] <kveldsmatCS> @indexiWhatr Phantom spray is ok, but not being able to headshot like with AK is not as satisfying
[2022-12-07 16:10:47] <antcolt> Tjena KG, det var l√§nge sedan. kul att se att det g√•r bra f√∂r dig! Grattis :)
[2022-12-07 16:10:54] <maxblancoo> @indexiWhatr spraying is easier in valo I would say -> less rewarding

[2022-12-07 16:12:49] <5timesbannednewacc> @skrix1337 Valo is the csgo killer
[2022-12-07 16:12:52] <maxblancoo> Deagle feels 10x better than sheriff same with AWP and Operator
[2022-12-07 16:12:58] <+merf_44> @skrix1337 for fun
[2022-12-07 16:12:59] <indexiWhatr> I don't know, I always felt like as soon as you don't one tap or miraculously hits the next 4-5 bullets, it's basically over (with Vandal atleast), but Phantom is indeed better with spraying @kveldsmatCS
[2022-12-07 16:13:04] <+madcsgo> olof what is ur opinion on valorant sniper vs csgo sniper?
