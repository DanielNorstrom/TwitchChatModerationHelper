[2022-12-16 00:00:03] <%greg0409> @Em__K @canadianplatypus Ill probably just be playing ashe unless they undo some of the spread change lol. I think pulling it back like 5-10% would make aiming with her primary feel good
[2022-12-16 00:00:12] <+Mike2621> She was buffed cause kiriko is better and she’s easily dived

[2022-12-16 00:01:39] <+squarepushR> buffin ana's nade just made kiriko a must pick and did nothing for the support deficit
[2022-12-16 00:01:41] <%redkakti> SO BRIGHTTTT
[2022-12-16 00:01:48] <Remix_45> OH BOY, IM REALLY ENJOYING THIS EPIC GAMING CONTENT FROM MY FAVORITE STREAMER EMONGG-IUS MAXIMUS
[2022-12-16 00:01:49] <+Em__K> @greg0409 people who hated soj still think she wasn't nerfed hard bc her railgun was frustrating to play against. she still has it.  they're just frustrating soj players too. now everyone's frustrated
[2022-12-16 00:01:58] <%redkakti> why it wa so bright KEKW
[2022-12-16 00:02:07] <NoT2BaDTV> giga damage
[2022-12-16 00:02:07] <%bolbi_in_canada> @squarepushR that's why they nerfed suzu
[2022-12-16 00:02:09] <Forsakei> I see they still haven't given Ramattra's projectiles a visual trail.

[2022-12-16 00:02:44] <%greg0409> @Em__K They didnt even nerf the part that was making her strong LOL They just made it so you cant win 1v1s without railgun tbh lmao
[2022-12-16 00:02:49] <@%^StreamElements> If you're noticing ads at unfortunate times, Twitch now requires all streams to run ads at set intervals. We're not triggering them, they're on Twitch's end and out of our control.

[2022-12-16 00:03:21] <YoshivsJoshi> Does the anti air thing go any further up or is it the same  distance?

[2022-12-16 00:03:32] <%greg0409> @Em__K also you cant even really burst fire it, the spread doesnt reset fast enough :)

[2022-12-16 00:03:44] <smatur20> D.Va amd Brigit skin when?
[2022-12-16 00:04:09] <+Em__K> @greg0409 yeah i'm pretty sure they silent nerfed the bloom reset

[2022-12-16 00:04:54] <smatur20> ty <3
[2022-12-16 00:04:55] <YoshivsJoshi> Did they increase the anti air distance vertically? Stream lagged
[2022-12-16 00:04:56] <%greg0409> @Em__K Im guessing its because of how much they increased the spread by, it takes longer for it to fully reset
[2022-12-16 00:05:06] <zugzugmine> POGGERS
[2022-12-16 00:05:11] <SpecsNStats> I love when Ramattra yells "ITS TEMPO TIME" and tempo's all over the enemy team

[2022-12-16 00:06:17] <GreysDraws> ram is good AND fun? broken lol
[2022-12-16 00:06:23] <+Em__K> @greg0409 well the first 9 shots of the burst were always accurate. but now you have to wait a lot longer than you used to
[2022-12-16 00:06:28] <frostvic17> Ramattra is a good tank.
[2022-12-16 00:06:30] <%greg0409> @Em__K and a projectile WITH spread like that is just.... yikes

[2022-12-16 00:06:54] <+kingshaymus> Yea being good and fun is so rare in this game. Blizz usually only allows one

[2022-12-16 00:07:04] <butt_poop_> tyty
[2022-12-16 00:07:11] <+jarrhead2> do you think ramattra has the potential to be too strong?
[2022-12-16 00:07:12] <shvagroos> i hope they wont buff cas untill he has that braidead nade
[2022-12-16 00:07:24] <%greg0409> @Em__K I do agree the the disruptor and slide nerfs were good though

[2022-12-16 00:07:51] <+Em__K> @greg0409 agreed. just nerf the bullet velocity of the primary fire and add recoil. that would have been good for lower and higher ranks. bloom is so dumb

[2022-12-16 00:08:01] <butt_poop_> Ram has a lot of knobs to tune if they need to lower the power level a bit. The move speed is too fun
[2022-12-16 00:08:03] <derzky_huerzky> ratamahattra is a strong tank, but he needs a 2 bastion's cannons on his shoulders
[2022-12-16 00:08:06] <zugzugmine> only 1 minute elapsed at least
[2022-12-16 00:08:17] <Forsakei> backfill? lol

[2022-12-16 01:45:35] <%+WellbeWelloff> @roguesimulation there isn't actually any healers in the game, but the meta supports are like Lucio and Kiriko. lol
[2022-12-16 01:45:37] <f1rstr1te> @thefatcat__ Rein isn’t any better. Its just played a lot in rank’s diamond and below

[2022-12-16 01:45:54] <TheseJeans> @thefatcat__ Ana and Lucio certainly enable Rein to being a raid boss
