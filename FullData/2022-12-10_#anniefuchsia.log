[2022-12-10 02:29:36] <%c0rb4> open world content its hard to find groups, and guilds is hard to find. maybe i ended up playing ally on a horde server @AnnieFuchsia
[2022-12-10 02:29:44] <Susanooo> and yea its not like im quitting ff or anything, i can play both sincee im filthy casual anyway xD
[2022-12-10 02:29:49] <%foggyfr> @upsetgut undead.. for the horrdeeee
[2022-12-10 02:29:57] <ladyenforcer> I ended up coming back due to this expansion.
[2022-12-10 02:30:05] <%drzaius30> honestly i never heard anyone talk about wow spite its popularity think it explains why i never crossed paths with it to last year
[2022-12-10 02:30:09] <Amalie> Im so sad i missed out on the feldrake drop PepeHands

[2022-12-10 02:30:50] <Susanooo> so i imagine when i hit 60 ill buy dragonflight because those dragons look SOO COOL
[2022-12-10 02:30:50] <ghostdragon2210> wow isn't sociable like it was pretty much solo and just meet for individual dungeons etc but join an alliance to get to know people a bit better I guess

[2022-12-10 14:12:58] <%Hezmund> @AnnieFuchsia Considering inflation and how big/complex games are now it makes sense for a AAA 50+ hour game to be 60-70. It sucks but I remember 15-ish years ago games were £40-50

[2022-12-10 15:00:00] <%Collnaris> i think your idea yesterday about the drop being exclusive maybe first 2 days then expanding to the category was a better solution

[2022-12-10 15:22:41] <+iamkeebler> Awesome! I just started playing wow a week ago and this is the first time watching you stream and I’m enjoying your chill vibe
[2022-12-10 15:22:42] <%Lorrdzik> you paid to have it earlier
[2022-12-10 15:22:43] <CarefulWithThatAxeEugene> theres a test at the end of the 4 hrs to recap everything that was done during the 4 hrs you watched for the  pet
[2022-12-10 15:22:47] <%Veger2112> Would of rather had a BIG BLIZZARD BEAR!
[2022-12-10 15:22:48] <%Collnaris> it now makes the mount and pet Region wide though, which i like

[2022-12-10 15:22:57] <Finloth> We still get it, though? I mean, it's a different skin at the least.
[2022-12-10 15:22:59] <+Porkins1202> Yeah its just nice to have a voice sometimes to listen to when your fishing, otherwise you start making your own voices
[2022-12-10 15:23:00] <SgtBoykot> they couldve reskinned atleast, not give people things for free which people also had to pay for
[2022-12-10 15:23:03] <chris200226> its my birthday today
[2022-12-10 15:23:08] <+internet__dad> plus theres more than likely a TON of newer players who didnt get the opportunity to get the pets and mounts

[2022-12-10 15:23:55] <+Xenokron> Out of curiosity, do you have to watch someone else for 4 hours to get a free mount or do you get credit for it since you are streaming for 4 hours?

[2022-12-10 15:54:42] <SparkieBits> I just use wowhead builds, these talent trees are too damn confusing
[2022-12-10 15:54:43] <%leftylafter> Why were the Dinosaurs afraid of one of Santa's Reindeer?
[2022-12-10 15:54:47] <DanubaM> icy veins is pretty good
[2022-12-10 15:54:51] <%Arms_Warrior> I usually copy a spec then change a couple talents depending on playstyle

[2022-12-10 16:04:30] <%Hezmund> because if you put points in you increase mats you get from DE'ing and have higher chance at blues/epics
[2022-12-10 16:04:35] <+Aronah1982> So many quests....
[2022-12-10 16:04:35] <%Collnaris> you could always wait and do the dungeon quests during Mythic runs

[2022-12-10 17:16:26] <%NayruHD> can do the double colored horns maybe

[2022-12-10 17:16:58] <Kleric95> the drakthyr were servants of Neltharian so black is probably the most legit color if you ask me
[2022-12-10 17:17:00] <%Nurutooo> at some point you could make infinite dragonflight evoker too @AnnieFuchsia
