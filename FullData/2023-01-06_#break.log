[2023-01-06 11:02:30] <%Clarkefruit> @3ammy i guess the only real difference is that prime sub doesn't auto renew

[2023-01-06 11:13:33] <%kleier> Clarkefruit FrogeHey
[2023-01-06 11:13:41] <%wbbigdave> For me, those memories came from the original Ghost Recon and playing coop with a buddy and blasting him with backblast from an RPG by mistake
[2023-01-06 11:13:42] <%noize> I really enjoyed Ultima Online
[2023-01-06 11:13:43] <%wbbigdave> Good times

I'd always played single player games before that as I was a billy no mates and when I got that MMO bug it just made so many cool memories, PvP battles on weekends on Teamspeak and insane LAN parties playing all weekend covered in patch cables in a mates garage.
[2023-01-06 11:14:42] <%+LiamDubheadScott> No shoreline is really quiet
[2023-01-06 11:14:42] <@%Breakspear> Favourite Game: Rimworld, Best memories: Elite Dangerous or PUBG

[2023-01-06 11:32:36] <+xBSide> I watched Cohh play it the other night and he was raaaaging too, it's a shame
[2023-01-06 11:32:45] <+xBSide> but the audio on this patch is so scuffed
[2023-01-06 11:33:11] <+xBSide> Yeah I've had that big time lately

[2023-01-06 11:33:41] <%LiamG> would 2 days off in a row help work/life balance?

[2023-01-06 11:34:38] <@%Breakspear> @LiamG I used to have a weekday off and a sunday off, and I preferred it to a normal weekend off. But it's all subjective
[2023-01-06 11:34:39] <%thirty3baboons> Often shorter streams are more entertaining - more focus and energy.
[2023-01-06 11:34:45] <BadTimber> Morning folks!
[2023-01-06 11:34:52] <+xBSide> I mean with the subathons Pestily has done he probably never needs to work again
[2023-01-06 11:35:02] <GlutenFreeVapes> Where's your side hustle? Where's the grindset?
[2023-01-06 11:35:06] <+xBSide> but yeah I 100% get you, I find 6 hours a day a challenge lol
[2023-01-06 11:35:18] <+xBSide> @GlutenFreeVapes "grindset" is for kids LUL
[2023-01-06 11:35:28] <%JonnyTBH> @xBSide he employs people though, for editing etc, so he pays their salaries as well
[2023-01-06 11:35:39] <GlutenFreeVapes> YEP
[2023-01-06 11:35:53] <+greeno88> Yeah but they don’t necessarily have kids too mate. No way of doing those hours with 2 hours sleep
[2023-01-06 11:35:58] <+xBSide> @JonnyTBH True but that's for YT and I would have thought that just YT pays for that

[2023-01-06 11:37:37] <%+Slyzard09> I always say that a persons most valuable thing is their time
[2023-01-06 11:37:43] <%$Perks_22> Kids overdo it that age though. The whole mentality that you can have what you want if you work hard enough is toxic af. People forget to be happy with what they have and appreciate the things around them. Speaking from experience here.
[2023-01-06 11:38:01] <GlutenFreeVapes> I'm liek the opposite, I don't care about money and have always been pretty poor, I should care like 5% more and It would be better
[2023-01-06 11:38:02] <%Josh_93_> @Harvey_UK LUL it's Friday so your allowed one today
[2023-01-06 11:38:03] <+xBSide> What I don't like about "grindset" mentality is that it reduces peoples worth to being just their productivity and income and that's a big yikes from me

[2023-01-06 12:56:36] <%+Harvey_UK> #Story - I brought a new build house and there was a bunch of issues. They all got fixed but I asked for Compensation for the hassle. The customer services manager offered me £2k but I wanted more. They got a bit defensive so I submitted a SAR and got every single email about me detailing the extent of all the issues and their attempts to fix them. My lawyer says this is the easiest case he's had in years. OMEGALOL

[2023-01-06 13:52:51] <mitchellx1992> @Monsieur_Toad income tax is only based on income
[2023-01-06 13:52:58] <%wbbigdave> Its a goddamn nightmare, but when my wife was not working, she claimed Child Benefit as it was "income" which counts towards NI / Pension, but it's ALL payable back as tax

[2023-01-06 13:54:02] <%fofo8383> cant you just employ Kel to work for you brkBrows
[2023-01-06 13:54:04] <%+Harvey_UK> @BreaK as you're likely self employed you should set up a childcare voucher scheme and then put into that each month ready for when Georgia goes to school because you can pay for afterschool clubs, school trips etc with that and it is pre-tax. When my son was born I immediately started paying into it and by the time he started school he had about £6k in his childcare account I stopped paying into it then and we still have a bit left and he leaves primary in 2 years
[2023-01-06 13:54:11] <%+Owlshoes> That's bonkers. You'd think there would be something in place.
[2023-01-06 13:54:12] <%AkimboRy> I wanted to be a firefighter growing up but because I was 5ft7 I got told I was way to small Sadge
[2023-01-06 13:54:12] <%+Pielil> That#s pretty decent
[2023-01-06 13:54:12] <%+Monsieur_Toad> @mitchellx1992 In France, income tax is based on income but is calculated differently depending on how many you are in your "home". So if you're married you can have tax calculated for both you and your SO. And if you have a child, it hads 0.5 people so it reduces taxes
[2023-01-06 13:54:13] <%+Hoogenboomer> My wifes mum was the first female fire fighter in Sussex (90s) and the story she tells how shit it was for women is shocking.. it's like they didn't know women existed! LUL

[2023-01-06 15:29:07] <%+Hoogenboomer> For contrast, 20 degree water feels very cold in a bath... It's because our body is 37 and therefore anything below that feels cold as a bath..

[2023-01-06 15:29:07] <%itraynor> Little trick if you're doing that ice bath stuff, and don't have a sauna to hop into after. Get a couple towels in the dryer so when you hop out you get warm towels to toss right on to shock back to warm
[2023-01-06 15:29:07] <%+Garbodor__> it's cold
[2023-01-06 15:29:09] <%+teddy_d> Oh piss off! Its warm like sacriels tea! Get in the ice bath and stop crying!

[2023-01-06 15:41:00] <@%GreggStrat> @zeo_rax Got this from a quick search... set your hot keys so heavy and light bleeds are on the same button, but press is one slot and release is another. Then put hp health item on a seperate key. I use 4 for ifak, 5 press for hemostat and 5 release for army bandage. When I get hit, I tap 5, the press prioritizes the heavy bleed, if there isn't any, then it defaults to the bandage for light bleed. If nothing happens, I tab 4 for healing.
