For people to come together with compassion and emotion to stand together in opposition to it is a beautiful thing. Although death is tragic, without the stories and sharing it would be without eachothers support.

[2022-12-19 11:15:30] <%Geir74> the stream has been 2 hours, you'd think someone noticed?
[2022-12-19 11:15:34] <%+AnAngryBadger56> everytime the alert goes off, I think that scooby doo and the gang are turning up LUL
[2022-12-19 11:15:34] <BUC0001> Should have made the sound alert a gun shot  ;)  lol
[2022-12-19 11:15:34] <%+chubby_panda9> @therunningmanz I love the alert sound lol, absolutely loved playing ocarina of time and majora's mask ^^
[2022-12-19 11:15:35] <%Pierre_Markuse> I see how you don't give a fuck about people complaining about the sound, and you shouldn't. But it is also obvious the sound will harm the stream and chat quality all day. Can't you route it to just your mix and not the stream mix?
[2022-12-19 11:15:53] <RoadyTwinkletoes> Alert sound is perfect
[2022-12-19 11:15:55] <+SirJimiee> I reckon we should make it louder Kappa

[2022-12-19 11:16:17] <+Cranky_old_goat> I think the sound is great, it means people care :)
[2022-12-19 11:16:22] <%+TheDeadmanZrunning> Can we change the sound to toilet cam ?
[2022-12-19 11:16:23] <@%Unclefood> @Pierre_Markuse What part of "We can't change the sound or volume" isn't translating?
[2022-12-19 11:16:23] <%cracksandjugs> On the nes it was a gold cartridge! Worth a bomb now I‚Äôd assume
[2022-12-19 11:16:24] <%thejasonparsons> please stop donating to charity its ruining my immersion LUL

[2022-12-19 12:37:11] <%Murray_TheDemonicSkull> Honey Badge very quiet Paul but less power than MCX (very short barrel). short range only
[2022-12-19 12:37:11] <%+SpaceShowerTeleVision> @TheRunningManZ anyway to turn those donate alerts down 10-15%?!?!?
[2022-12-19 12:37:18] <@%+AlheyaKnight> most bank cards are debit gravy
[2022-12-19 12:37:21] <@%MrMcGravyBaby> weve never endorsed it, not for subs or donations

[2022-12-19 12:38:44] <@%MrMcGravyBaby> Just donate what you have, not what the bank will loan you putting you in a hole you might not be able to climb out of#

[2022-12-19 12:38:54] <@%Unclefood> @BudgeQT Because you're adding % to the total cost on your end just to 'help'. If you can donate from funds you actually have, great. Otherwise maybe don't rent your goodwill and pay a fee on it

[2022-12-19 12:39:05] <%the_dailynomad> they should make bows and arrows craftable from trees and rope, this will be epic, a quick weapon for anyone to get at the start, great for zombies as well

[2022-12-19 12:47:13] <%+jkutastrofik> I was thinking, wouldn't it be a good idea to have a limited time to loot a dead player before they themselves come back as a zombie? Maybe they're like super zombies when they come back, takes a bit moe to kill them? Or is that just a silly idea?
[2022-12-19 12:47:17] <NIDhish_A_N> new vid was pretty good, loved the despawn they deserved it
[2022-12-19 12:47:17] <@%Unclefood> @DefoAnoob But IRL zombies aren't real and all that ;)
[2022-12-19 12:47:19] <easy__ezzington> @unclefood imagine poisoning a peice of meat and keeping it seperate from your other food and when you are killed a player loots you and inadvertently kills themselves because.

[2022-12-19 12:53:35] <%hochundhighlig> If you know someone with Alzheimer's, try to adapt to them otherwise they get stresst out. Example: Your neighbor has Alzheimer and his wife put his laundry in the garden for dry, later he asks you if you left your cloths in his garden. At this point tell him something like: Oh yes, there was no space in my garden, therefore I left them in yours. Like this you will take allot of confusion from them and they are way less stressed out! :-)

[2022-12-19 13:28:56] <Balzepho> many great inventors or scientists never got recognition or cash while alive, some get all this without so much as an effort and some die crazy in love with a pigeon like Tesla..point is, most of us on chat buy and use at least one of the top fortune 5's products..so its all lil absurd ^^
[2022-12-19 13:29:03] <+HappyJoeLucky> keep this alert forever!

[2022-12-19 13:29:39] <%+mr_smaII> Can you soften your voice more to compensate for the alert :))))
[2022-12-19 13:29:39] <+BudgeQT> @TheRunningManZ the problem is if you watch the stream on TV or speakers. I switched to headphones so its okay but on the TV my dog was jumping to the roof everytime :D
[2022-12-19 13:29:41] <%QuagaarZ> @TheRunningManZ These youngsters moaning about the volume lk

[2022-12-19 13:31:05] <maluboiii> Elon is exposing censorship, very controversial
[2022-12-19 13:31:06] <+DrDyna> KKona people have this "temporarily embarrassed millionaire" schtick they have to adhere to
[2022-12-19 13:31:06] <VITRIOL3D> He literally restricted people from posting links to other social media
[2022-12-19 13:31:06] <nordiccoffe> Elon Musk reminds me off a an old fashion Bond villains

[2022-12-19 13:31:21] <FlederMausi_> Everbody has the right for his opinion.
[2022-12-19 13:31:22] <+joeybaggadonuts_yo> I care. He's properly fucked Twitter.
[2022-12-19 13:31:24] <Balzepho> Indeed , ill start caring the day anyone thats that rich does something incredibly altruistic or has a life changing idea...didnt happen so far
[2022-12-19 13:31:24] <Farty_Kreuger> The people that hate him now used to adore him until he made that purchase and it became fashion to hate on him.
[2022-12-19 13:31:27] <@%Unclefood> @MorrowSphere They did. Hope they can re-add smokeGasm as smoketvDrool with the same emote, it's absurd they would remove the emote just for image
[2022-12-19 13:31:35] <argiebarge> he comes across as a bit of a man child
[2022-12-19 13:31:35] <%+DrMalevolent91> he hasn't messed twitter up at all, everyone in my field still using it for what it is....free and able to communicate easily in my field of research
[2022-12-19 13:31:36] <%Geir74> like sean locke said "I can see the bad sides, AND the good sides"

[2022-12-19 13:31:52] <%liberation__> people care because he's bought a social platform which is basically a utility and started banning journalists from it. this does affect you.
[2022-12-19 13:31:54] <CXLDVSNXRTH> @mrmcgravybaby people are the saviour of mankind. aint nobody saving your own life.. :) if we dont do it no one will. just image when someone speak that kinda stuff.
[2022-12-19 13:31:54] <%+blacklabel1983> It is a Internet fad now to hate Musk... Just like Nickleback
[2022-12-19 13:31:58] <darthsinister> just dont say anything about where his jets going

[2022-12-19 13:32:09] <angry_hell_pig> I'd like to know why in his meta verse world he didn't make the avatars have legs. LUL all that financial backing and they have no legs
[2022-12-19 13:32:09] <%+CrowdCtrlAlt> @drmalevolent91 Twitter is a complete joke now, nobody takes seriously
[2022-12-19 13:32:09] <%+ZagorskyAddict> I think it's a bit too much when tweets anti trans or other hateful things as he does sometimes but I can't really be bothered either. I just closed my twitter account when he started with that crap.

[2022-12-19 13:47:33] <+SirJimiee> do we know if the devs still plan on adding aerial vehicles
[2022-12-19 13:47:35] <%+DrMalevolent91> Bet they keep the hand bug in as a legacy feature

[2022-12-19 16:51:07] <%bartelzz> Do you think you would still be playing dayz if streaming/youtube hadn't taken off at all?
[2022-12-19 16:51:16] <%TomEmilioDavies> @easy__ezzington Although th be fair, he has potentially forgotten.

[2022-12-19 22:17:02] <%$themaxrayman> Squash (also called cordial or dilute) is a non-alcoholic concentrated syrup. It is used in beverage making. It is usually fruit-flavoured. Squash is made from fruit juice, water, and sugar. Modern squashes may also contain food coloring and additional flavoring.

[2022-12-19 22:24:25] <@%+Redline_Si> BBQ sauces vary wildly on area here in the states. Its very regional. Generic BBQ sauce does kinda suck, I agree @TheRunningManZ
[2022-12-19 22:24:26] <%+alex_in_stl> The sauce has to be caramelized to add a crisp to the BBQ.

[2022-12-19 22:35:49] <@%^Nightbot> Take time exploring the map, don't worry about getting all the loots. Follow roads or power lines to towns, find a road sign with a towns name and use an external map to navigate with !maps. Stay warm and dry! Zombies often have food, drinks and tools on them. If you aren't finding loot in a town someone might have just been through it, move on to the next town. Always remember that gear comes and goes, everyone dies, and to Have Fun!
