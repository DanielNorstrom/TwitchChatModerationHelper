Its modern form was influenced by improvements made by Marie-Antoine Carême.

[2022-12-31 22:46:51] <%Yuki_Duki> @Goddess_TTV that anime is my biggest let down, the studio forced the writers to finish early so they squished the story in the last couple of episodes
[2022-12-31 22:46:56] <%Yuki_Duki> 24 episodes in deed
[2022-12-31 22:47:07] <%Yuki_Duki> bro nobody messes with my anime knowledge, ive seen over 800 anime

[2022-12-31 22:55:51] <@%727life> it was there I think
[2022-12-31 22:55:51] <CurlEBrace> there's a PSO eyecup

[2022-12-31 22:55:56] <@%$atownmanx> @Axel_tv use link search when you have the PSO selected
[2022-12-31 22:55:56] <CurlEBrace> but it's prapor 3 i think
[2022-12-31 22:55:57] <!%+Goddess_TTV> @foreveralonell dang that sucks! literally have to spam hit buy on the barter stuff

[2022-12-31 22:56:30] <%Yuki_Duki> i think it requires PSO scope

[2022-12-31 22:56:46] <!%+Goddess_TTV> @foreveralonell ah i thought you meant it going out of stock too fast!
[2022-12-31 22:56:49] <!%mimikSVK> is compact scope ?
[2022-12-31 22:56:51] <@%727life> not sure monstrum counts as the scope he's looking for tbh
