[2022-12-07 00:35:29] <%its_viviane> OHH sadist, i saw a tiktok where they said the unknown element on the TCG dices, are similar to paimon's symbol or something like that and its maybe a new element
[2022-12-07 00:35:29] <cbo2o6> the only lore i know is connecting the dots from the aranara to the 3.2 archon quest
[2022-12-07 00:35:43] <%its_viviane> ya!
[2022-12-07 00:35:45] <AutumnZakura> IT DOES RIGHT?!?!? its so diff at the beginning (i only know cus uh... started a NA acc recently)

[2022-12-07 00:36:46] <cbo2o6> imagine we get a light element because of the light sigils in 2.5 from the enka event
[2022-12-07 00:36:47] <%naomu_> Have you hard of the light and dark elements?
[2022-12-07 00:36:52] <clouds_hide> I think there are light and abyss elements
[2022-12-07 00:36:55] <+Desdemonaii> no i dont think the TCG dice is hinting at a new element; if u play any card game with elements theres always an energy that can recharge any element (omni meaning all)
[2022-12-07 00:36:58] <%its_viviane> maybe?
