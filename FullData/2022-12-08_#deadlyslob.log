[2022-12-08 13:20:31] <Shooky13579> with 10 more years of FF14 planned, I would say now is the ideal time to get invested in it, honestly.

[2022-12-08 13:20:40] <%Captainbovril> @MahamiHanu No, we don't.
[2022-12-08 13:20:48] <Shooky13579> not to mention FF14's newest expansion is easily the best one that's been made.

[2022-12-08 13:55:38] <weekendEMO> glenn dying was my last straw
[2022-12-08 13:55:38] <+Jay_Coe> Because they killed Abraham as well
[2022-12-08 13:55:38] <%+Infest__> that was the first big drop in viewers
[2022-12-08 13:55:38] <%+commandoism> tank jumped the shart

[2022-12-08 13:55:41] <sdunne09> Glen lead to Negan, Negan was a major let down
[2022-12-08 13:55:42] <+12GageB97> Glenn hiding under a dumpster was a pretty big straw
[2022-12-08 13:55:43] <ChiefMonsta> at some point they killed way too many important characters
[2022-12-08 13:55:46] <%gumbii2> I stopped even before Glenn
[2022-12-08 13:55:49] <%+TempestPhoenix> it was for me, they were the only interesting characters left
[2022-12-08 13:55:49] <+triv37> @Deadlyslob nah it was the FARM season that killed it

[2022-12-08 13:56:13] <+xRinzler13> tank was prison no?
[2022-12-08 13:56:14] <%J0k3r007_> I was waiting whole first season them start fighting and building civilixation from the ashes. They instead yelling bullshits on each odher and cry...
[2022-12-08 13:56:16] <%+commandoism> season 3
[2022-12-08 13:56:16] <AutoStealth> Nothing will compare in disappointment as LOST did.

[2022-12-08 13:56:17] <%Slipysalmon> see, so many people stopped watching because of glen
[2022-12-08 13:56:17] <The_Guyver_B> I stopped after Glen. It was an admission that good writing had given way to shock and gore

[2022-12-08 13:56:19] <%Bramous> Yeah season 2 got real slow
[2022-12-08 13:56:21] <%+commandoism> was the tank and the preacher
[2022-12-08 13:56:22] <sdunne09> The farm season / the prison season were the biginning of the end
[2022-12-08 13:56:26] <%+cammmdog> After season 4, it was trash. Hated the governor
[2022-12-08 13:56:27] <+tomcatlifts> Farm season was bad because there was a writers strike so it was wholly filler

[2022-12-08 14:02:30] <giottoMKD> the zombie universe starts with the virus overwhelming everything and everything colapses
[2022-12-08 14:02:34] <giottoMKD> its easier that way
[2022-12-08 14:02:38] <Nambrok> The problem in the Walking Dead, is that all dead become undead
[2022-12-08 14:02:44] <skadoodle3393> @commandoism they show up a bit even in the last season

[2022-12-08 14:02:52] <waahdur> this sounds familiar
[2022-12-08 14:02:53] <engineerz_hero1> that strategy depends on who's depiction of zombies we are talking about. like walking dead? or world War Z or that batista Netflix version

[2022-12-08 14:03:13] <sdunne09> @Deadlyslob I think that's what they were tryign to fix with the lab story where they said that everyone had the zombie virus lying dormant in them. It was a very poor patch over the plot hole though
[2022-12-08 14:03:13] <%+Billy_boots> wonder how easy it was to get Toilet paper during the z apocalypse ?

[2022-12-08 14:04:57] <+triv37> they kinda touch upon that during the part when theyre stuck in the science lab with the scientist. They watch and MRI scan and he says theyve recorded different times it takes people to change

[2022-12-08 14:05:03] <%+M0osejuice> well, that could be explained by normal viral immune response. People react differently.

[2022-12-08 14:14:23] <+Majoury> @deadlyslob compare it to fortnite. people spend 2k on skins use them for a week and never touch them. chances are if you spend 2k on a ship in SC you'll use it often
[2022-12-08 14:14:23] <%Sl33perService> seems like most of the stuff on the ships doesn't really work?

[2022-12-08 14:17:47] <learningtosmile> I just hate that SC has all that budget and it's the most vanilla mundane space aesthetic imaginable, I get it's probably what their players want but it's so bland
[2022-12-08 14:17:47] <waahdur> more people would play it if it were more user friendly but I like the hardcore aspect of it
[2022-12-08 14:17:52] <@%NightShiftGamingHD> jesus

[2022-12-08 14:18:04] <%Bergle> Manley is the best
[2022-12-08 14:18:04] <%cheeseandbunionthe4th> is the crysis game a joke or is it really that hard to play at high fps?
[2022-12-08 14:18:06] <+xxTheCombatWombatxx> how soon?
[2022-12-08 14:18:07] <Vaticc_> honestly, I see Tarkov in the same light as SC now. I dont think Tarkov will ever release and theyll keep changing it like an alpha live service
[2022-12-08 14:18:09] <Eutolicos> i have been there for the 1st hangar
[2022-12-08 14:18:13] <+quelthela> I founded at the start and it was 10+

[2022-12-08 14:18:26] <@%NightShiftGamingHD> Bro, Scott is the fuckin man when it comes to space shit
[2022-12-08 14:18:29] <+TallBoy_Ryan> @vaticc_ i definitely think full release tarkov is a fever dream
[2022-12-08 14:18:35] <@%daddyCASH> They had like a handful of people in the beginning lol
[2022-12-08 14:18:37] <eststar1> I bought some ships but I still agree about selling those expensive ships feel scam

[2022-12-08 14:28:05] <MrAnderson511> Sup
[2022-12-08 14:28:06] <%+seth6815> It is weird.. Scavs wedge the door but PMCs need a card? Just odd
[2022-12-08 14:28:06] <bisonzx10r> if ur a scav and attack the bosses like gluhar do you lose rep??
[2022-12-08 14:28:06] <+Zumbig> what?

[2022-12-08 14:28:17] <%cheeseandbunionthe4th> why?
[2022-12-08 14:28:18] <%TwiggehTV> Autoaim for MOUSE?! wtfffffff
[2022-12-08 14:28:19] <calebhub514> I feel like that would mess me up more than help lmao
[2022-12-08 14:28:19] <%+AtrixGames> aim assist for KBM? Wtf?
[2022-12-08 14:28:19] <+quelthela> yea. I suspect that darktide has aim assist
[2022-12-08 14:28:24] <+TallBoy_Ryan> apparently that wasn’t intended
[2022-12-08 14:28:27] <waahdur> they should just remove it all together
[2022-12-08 14:28:28] <%rambushd> just when you think 343 can't do much worse
[2022-12-08 14:28:28] <%cheeseandbunionthe4th> wouldnt that mess with precision
[2022-12-08 14:28:35] <+RStarphoenix> well if they give aim assist for KBM, one less thing for cheaters LUL
[2022-12-08 14:28:36] <Surlaw1_> console and pc should never be in the same lobby in the first place
[2022-12-08 14:28:38] <learningtosmile> if controller players get aim assist in mixed lobbies that's just fair
[2022-12-08 14:28:39] <MrBREEKY> really
[2022-12-08 14:28:39] <%TwiggehTV> Just let the game play itself then, at that point
[2022-12-08 14:28:42] <+quelthela> It feeels like
[2022-12-08 14:28:55] <Dave_e> it might have some melee snapping but ranged definitely doesnt
[2022-12-08 14:28:56] <%TwiggehTV> @Surlaw1_ preach
[2022-12-08 14:28:57] <@%daddyCASH> I see people missing more then hitting in DT lol
[2022-12-08 14:29:02] <%+commandoism> give him the spritz
[2022-12-08 14:29:03] <+quelthela> when unscoped. the hip fire feels to be aim assisted.
[2022-12-08 14:29:08] <ChiefMonsta> @learningtosmile have you ever played on controller? xD NotLikeThis
[2022-12-08 14:29:10] <%cheeseandbunionthe4th> I woudl prefer to have my raw input than AA on mouse, but in wz by god is AA overpowered
[2022-12-08 14:29:16] <Dave_e> hmm yeah unscoped maybe
[2022-12-08 14:29:16] <bicepsasaru> why to play an fps game with aim assist? its just numbs your skills
[2022-12-08 14:29:20] <%kermi_the_mermi> finally have my internet back. i can binge deadly again
[2022-12-08 14:29:25] <sinsemilla_swe> what has aim assist turned into? It was ment to help those with aiming disability. Not to make someone OP
[2022-12-08 14:29:42] <%+commandoism> darktide is not a game of precision shooting

[2022-12-08 14:29:50] <Surako> @bicepsasaru Aim assist makes sense for controller and for a large portion of the playerbase.
[2022-12-08 14:29:51] <%cheeseandbunionthe4th> gta aim assist is on another level lol
[2022-12-08 14:29:58] <%kermi_the_mermi> u dont need precision in darktide
[2022-12-08 14:30:07] <+RStarphoenix> Warzone 100% has controller aim assist

[2022-12-08 14:30:08] <%tolmacs13> @cheeseandbunionthe4th gta aim assist is basically just aimbot lol
[2022-12-08 14:30:09] <%Hammerkeg> Lol, I mean when people started using controllers on PC because it's easier to aim, it makes sense to add it to M&KB.
[2022-12-08 14:30:10] <bicepsasaru> controler locks like crazzy
[2022-12-08 14:30:12] <%+bugeyedben> @Deadlyslob you're still using the Wireless Sennheiser headset?  would you recommend them?  or any other recommendations.   i want to go wireless
[2022-12-08 14:30:14] <fishdelta> warzone 1 had aim assist
[2022-12-08 14:30:16] <%+StrawberryGlucoseTab> I can’t wait to see his karma
[2022-12-08 14:30:20] <%LARS9000_> any type of aim assist is dumb if you're older than 8
[2022-12-08 14:30:28] <+owlTman> as long as it's not outrageously OP I think it's fine for accessibility.
[2022-12-08 14:30:29] <KeinHerz> karma is gone
[2022-12-08 14:30:30] <Sorciak> we soon anyway
[2022-12-08 14:30:31] <%cheeseandbunionthe4th> @tolmacs13 aim anywhere in a 90 degree radius and it straight headshots lol
[2022-12-08 14:30:31] <sinsemilla_swe> I played in Swedish national team in BF3 in Nations cup, they would kick you out for proving to be bad if using aim assist
[2022-12-08 14:30:31] <+dibles420> If anything I'd turn aim assist off in Darktide, could get me killed by aiming at the wrong enemy. Happened to me in COD Zombies all the time
[2022-12-08 14:30:32] <Sorciak> wipe*
[2022-12-08 14:30:47] <%kermi_the_mermi> there is aim assist for K&M ???????????
[2022-12-08 14:30:50] <%+AtrixGames> i've been done by aim assist on WZ a few times, snapping to head from chest
[2022-12-08 14:31:00] <+triv37> @kermi_the_mermi NO
[2022-12-08 14:31:02] <+quelthela> They say that there is not but I see other people with similart view than mine
[2022-12-08 14:31:06] <%+Mr_Implicit> Is there aim assist for dance pad though
[2022-12-08 14:31:08] <+TheMindTerrorist> @Half_Baked__ Not having a choice isn't a good feeling :P
[2022-12-08 14:31:09] <%HazardousBacon> People pay almost 100 dollars for games just to play on lowest settings and use any setting to get an upper hand rather than enjoy the game for what it is
[2022-12-08 14:31:11] <+quelthela> hmmm tricky.
[2022-12-08 14:31:14] <%cheeseandbunionthe4th> mkb on wz is a massive disadvantage
[2022-12-08 14:31:15] <@%daddyCASH> Deadly needs aim assist since turning boomer
[2022-12-08 14:31:18] <KeinHerz> thats gluchkar
[2022-12-08 14:31:20] <st4zn> certain games had janky inputs like 15 years ago, aim assist was good for that. now its a cheat
[2022-12-08 14:31:21] <%tolmacs13> aim assist is nice on controller for long range stuff, its very OP close range tho

[2022-12-08 14:32:19] <bicepsasaru> I think it was never meant to be a cross platform if controllers have aim assists as if you jump or go prone they just locks on you

[2022-12-08 15:03:13] <%+Billy_boots> moderation would be the issue
[2022-12-08 15:03:16] <Scuba_SK> you should play on the RP server as a tow truck driver. That would be hilarious

[2022-12-08 15:26:40] <%+Hobokop> that's because often the use multiple eggs to increase chances

[2022-12-08 15:26:52] <%+commandoism> yeah but not with IVF they put in as many implants to hope one takes
[2022-12-08 15:26:55] <%+Jereck_Gilean> All the eggs in one basket
[2022-12-08 15:26:59] <%+RedbeardG> Correct
[2022-12-08 15:27:01] <The_Guyver_B> Correct
[2022-12-08 15:27:02] <%+commandoism> and you end up with a lot of twins and tripplets

[2022-12-08 15:27:07] <+nakilo12> yep, they put multiple fertilized eggs to increase success rate
[2022-12-08 15:27:08] <@%daddyCASH> way to many couples I know get more
[2022-12-08 15:27:11] <Interceptor781> If you have twins first you don’t know what one kid is like so you’re good
[2022-12-08 15:27:13] <%+barandil> IVF CAN just be one - but most people put in two because the process is so expensive

[2022-12-08 15:37:29] <%+justanotherpoo> @MuffinSpectre Nice.  Never knew that.  Those were the days.
[2022-12-08 15:37:29] <%+afpops> A goldeneye reboot would not hold up
[2022-12-08 15:37:30] <MelSinister> @cheeseandbunionthe4th One of my childhood favorite movies

[2022-12-08 15:37:53] <%3ernie> of a time
[2022-12-08 15:37:53] <+sMoKe2501> Are you ashamed that you keep the game in the closet?
[2022-12-08 15:37:56] <%+AvoidsM8> 100% arena shooters are dead.. I hate to admit it
[2022-12-08 15:37:56] <%lackenspaceaim> its basically just call of duty ?

[2022-12-08 15:38:22] <dickiy_pickle> I don’t think they are dead dead, they need to be reinvented
[2022-12-08 15:38:23] <travistoohairy> their monetization was really bad too
[2022-12-08 15:38:23] <%Buttleak69> That is because they are buttcheeks

[2022-12-08 15:38:44] <dohtENV> Super Monkey Ball was good then and is good now
[2022-12-08 15:38:44] <%cheeseandbunionthe4th> they even pushed the pro scene as much as they could
[2022-12-08 15:38:45] <%+GrizZzlyG> Area shooters have been around since the beginning of gaming

[2022-12-08 15:39:07] <%+AvoidsM8> @lackenspaceaim COD sells because you can casually pick it up, get the boys online, have a few beers. Most arena shooters makes you SWEAT
[2022-12-08 15:39:07] <Rincai> really hope they don't wipe in december again.. it's bad for people with families

[2022-12-08 15:43:06] <Average_jojo> well lighthouse was horrible when it first came out
[2022-12-08 15:43:08] <%npc2453> @75caddy all stashes have a chance
[2022-12-08 15:43:08] <leadload> the same as light house so 5 fps confirmed
[2022-12-08 15:43:11] <ecchigun_> they just kept pushing out skins/content - thats the important part
[2022-12-08 15:43:13] <%MarineMiske> is it today?
[2022-12-08 15:43:16] <%lackenspaceaim> dont you guys have 4090's Kappa
[2022-12-08 15:43:16] <+Dies_Often> @Pigeons24 i wonder if he had a bleed and just said fuck it im not making it out w this anyways
[2022-12-08 15:43:18] <%+GreasedM0nkey> this labs event is supposedly a server test run
[2022-12-08 15:43:18] <st4zn> streets was done at least last year afaik, but the fps was a issue they worked on
[2022-12-08 15:43:32] <%+Pigeons24> @Dies_Often That's my thought.  Or a busted leg.
[2022-12-08 15:43:36] <%cheeseandbunionthe4th> @ecchigun_ yeah, but fortnite brought BR to the masses, arma 3 unknows mod was teh first BR, but fortntie changed everything as it ws the first to come to console and pc
[2022-12-08 15:43:37] <+Mechan1cs> it would be awesome if they redid scav AI , would revitalize the game more than any gun/map
[2022-12-08 15:43:40] <drtydve> Aren't all missions not final?? lol
[2022-12-08 15:43:40] <ChiWhiteSox2021> Why release it early then ? :/
[2022-12-08 15:43:45] <The_Guyver_B> "we're bowing to community pressure and the need for playerbase retention by releasing too early"
[2022-12-08 15:43:48] <Surlaw1_> nikita once said he would be surprised if you run into anyone
[2022-12-08 15:43:51] <loot_boxxx> I think it will be too big for main pvp map
[2022-12-08 15:43:52] <%StabbySausage> Streets is gonna be annoying as fuck unless they rework vertical audio
[2022-12-08 15:43:53] <%bEn_Ja_m1N> stop whining chat. wait till it's released at least deadlyCringe
[2022-12-08 15:43:56] <+Dies_Often> @Pigeons24 my first thought too but he was doing the run animation on death
[2022-12-08 15:44:00] <DonLirion> 45 frames on customs, 30 something in lighthouse so that makes it 20 on streets LUL

[2022-12-08 15:44:15] <%+NileRiver666> I just hope they don’t ruin streets like Reserve and the massive underground area.

[2022-12-08 15:44:34] <KhorneTheBloody> they mentioned 100 between scav bosses and pmc

[2022-12-08 15:44:41] <Digmo62> The sale of 4090s will go up the day after wipe.

[2022-12-08 15:44:43] <%red_leader1192> @NileRiver666 labs is that massive underground area lol
[2022-12-08 15:44:46] <%cheeseandbunionthe4th> @ecchigun_ yeah 100%, i remebr before fortnite, everything was about arena shooter and I rarely hear about any of them now,
[2022-12-08 15:44:49] <%+jdekk28> going to be interesting having to enter Labs through another map.
[2022-12-08 15:44:50] <@%daddyCASH> oooo, Transformers: Rise of the Beasts trailer is out
[2022-12-08 15:44:51] <malfurion2020> Spicy tradeoff idea: no scavs on Streets, but keep scavs on Labs LUL
[2022-12-08 15:44:55] <MelSinister> Definitely less scavs
[2022-12-08 15:44:55] <%StabbySausage> @Deadlyslob ya think Streets is gonna be enjoyable with how vertical audio currently is
[2022-12-08 15:44:56] <%+op3um> 100% and that’s the more important thing to test right?
[2022-12-08 15:44:58] <%weef> the servers can't handle a reasonable number of scavs so it's a moot point
[2022-12-08 15:44:59] <%+Dsnack> i'm hoping this wipe revitalized the community and keeps interest for longer this time round
[2022-12-08 15:45:01] <drtydve> I get that it's a small studio, it has been two years since they teased it
[2022-12-08 15:45:06] <DonLirion> @daddyCASH it looked dope
[2022-12-08 15:45:10] <%Emperors_Crusade> I kinda like the pve in Tarkov more than pvp. Or maybe I’m a pussy leslietOkh8r
[2022-12-08 15:45:13] <%WunderEnrique> Honestly, miss me with a new map. Get on revamping the quests or im not coming back for wipe.
[2022-12-08 15:45:16] <Surako> @daddyCASH yeah, not the best trailer thou
[2022-12-08 15:45:19] <+Ethop> sv-98 mods? thats cool. havent played in a  quite a few months
[2022-12-08 15:45:19] <%bEn_Ja_m1N> @digmo62 I'd be surprised. performance in tarkov depends a lot on CPU
[2022-12-08 15:45:24] <kasram10> Pestily said the same but the reason is for frame reasons
[2022-12-08 15:45:24] <%$binkatron5000> @drtydve longer than two years i think LUL
[2022-12-08 15:45:25] <KhorneTheBloody> was boss confirmed in streets?

[2022-12-08 15:45:32] <+Deft621> "only" 90 fps Sadge
[2022-12-08 15:45:34] <+santana_claws> performance has been garbage since the event
[2022-12-08 15:45:35] <@%daddyCASH> cant pls everyone @Surako
[2022-12-08 15:45:37] <+SolidSegal> i was playing tarkov again the other day and it felt like shit for me too coming back
[2022-12-08 15:45:37] <%+McKillers132> But if they make it PVP and it runs like crap, then people are gonna hate it
[2022-12-08 15:45:38] <%+GrizZzlyG> somin in the background?
[2022-12-08 15:45:38] <%+ruthless_mindset> streets will be a sniper haven
[2022-12-08 15:45:41] <%+cyntheria90> @drtydve its because the scope of this map is something thats never been done before..ever
[2022-12-08 15:45:41] <%Emperors_Crusade> Restart and clear cashe
[2022-12-08 15:45:43] <ecchigun_> @cheeseandbunionthe4th arena shooters are losing because they cant really reinvent the mode - like team deathmatch

[2022-12-08 15:58:26] <sdunne09> @Deadlyslob to be fair, just compare the MW2 origional missions to MW2 Reboot and its not even close. MW2 reboot felt like it was written by teeagers. The devs played Ghost Recon Wildlands, Uncharted and Rainbow 6 and decided they wanted to make all of them in one game with no real story. They should have done episodes of disconected Spec ops missions with different teams released week by week over the course of the "Season". Very poor for how good the campaign was from 2019

[2022-12-08 16:08:16] <Aphaiton> @Deadlyslob If you had the chance to get a new streameritem, would you still like it to be the beardoil or something else?
[2022-12-08 16:08:17] <totally_immersed> yea when you are not streaming its a boring 15 min loading with cricket sounds :D
[2022-12-08 16:08:21] <NextDoorGuy> yea cause gameplay is 50% of time spent, rest is on menus
[2022-12-08 16:08:21] <%+Dsnack> spend more time in loading as opposed to in game, but i love it
[2022-12-08 16:08:28] <%cheeseandbunionthe4th> gotta play tarkov with 2 monitors or a phone to do something while waiting
[2022-12-08 16:08:32] <%+GreasedM0nkey> desync would also make it better LUL
[2022-12-08 16:08:33] <+EatMeIAmCookie> FACTS
[2022-12-08 16:08:36] <+FatherOwens> honestly i think load times are what make the game so intense
[2022-12-08 16:08:38] <+Joshking518> 100% correct
[2022-12-08 16:08:38] <keszel23> church
[2022-12-08 16:08:38] <%notanothernathan> hard agree.
[2022-12-08 16:08:38] <Candy_Gram> You'd still have to load up and that can take a good while lol
[2022-12-08 16:08:39] <MelSinister> foxyfoxIQ

[2022-12-08 16:08:42] <$HarrySeaward1> 100%
[2022-12-08 16:08:43] <+Ballsy_Baldwin> its also teh time it takes to gear back up
[2022-12-08 16:08:44] <MrBREEKY> it would be way better i agree
[2022-12-08 16:08:44] <Lchronicl> yep true dieing would be as bad
[2022-12-08 16:08:45] <%+JTAKER> If the queue times were significantly reduced, I would literally only play Tarkov
[2022-12-08 16:08:46] <apexRaiden> I feel like if gearing up and getting back into the game would bring SO many more people to the game.
[2022-12-08 16:08:55] <%Fuego_> Bro I am so tired of the rain and sounds in general lol
[2022-12-08 16:08:58] <%red_leader1192> broken audio is what kills it for me, mostly
[2022-12-08 16:08:58] <%sn00by_d00> naamsayin?
[2022-12-08 16:09:04] <%cheeseandbunionthe4th> maybe the traders could seel full kits?
[2022-12-08 16:09:05] <+ImPizzaboytony> need a loadout preset to improve off the gun presets
[2022-12-08 16:09:05] <%Cnight29> then you dont have 15 mins to sit there and be mad
[2022-12-08 16:09:06] <%Vaticc_> Dark and Darker was great for that. and having the default kit
[2022-12-08 16:09:09] <+EatMeIAmCookie> i use cheap gear i get back anyway. the only punishment for dying is the time it takes

[2022-12-08 16:09:12] <%StabbySausage> @Deadlyslob not really a hot take to say "better playability would make the game better" LUL
[2022-12-08 16:09:12] <PorphyrStyx> Just imagine Tarkov Quere would be like The Cycle.
[2022-12-08 16:09:15] <%+spacepunch_> i forget what game came out recently that had super fast que times where you were just back in asap
[2022-12-08 16:09:19] <%+BVMBLEBEETUNA> with the queue times improve in v1? or is this a fundamental 'feature' of eft? @Deadlyslob
[2022-12-08 16:09:20] <%+cammmdog> Here is the real issue. Where you are waiting for you friends to make a load out for about 30 minutes and load in to a raid to get 1 tapped 3 minutes in. That is the worst problem...or awful friends lol
[2022-12-08 16:09:23] <+FatherOwens> Hot take: If you could immediately queue in, the matches would not be as intense.
[2022-12-08 16:09:31] <%dinnerparty> the hunt showdown system is S tier for mitigating downtime imo
[2022-12-08 16:09:37] <MelSinister> the biggest issue I have with this game is the footstep volume NotLikeThis
[2022-12-08 16:09:37] <mcgral18> loadouts and fast queues
[2022-12-08 16:09:44] <%Sautez_Josh> But then it wouldn't be so good as a streaming game.  :-)
[2022-12-08 16:09:48] <%+CapitalFriction> lowers the stakes a little
[2022-12-08 16:09:51] <%cheeseandbunionthe4th> could they have traders sell full kits, easy fix and straight back into action?
[2022-12-08 16:09:52] <glorgashack> Hot Take: Suppressors are found in raid ONLY and break at extraction
[2022-12-08 16:09:59] <cabbagetits> but that shit is exactly why FUCK FACTORY
[2022-12-08 16:09:59] <%AVDK69> I don't play to suffer KEKW
[2022-12-08 16:10:00] <%+assortedgnomes> @Deadlyslob aren't you making the mistake that people play tarkov for fun and not pain?
[2022-12-08 16:10:01] <+EatMeIAmCookie> @MelSinister also true can i please hear something other than my own char?
[2022-12-08 16:10:01] <$75caddy> they need a AI to run big games to keep em running properly
[2022-12-08 16:10:06] <%dirtygibson> That's my problem with it.  I don't have hours and hours to play to get good enough to prgress.  I get maybe 3 to 4 raids a week if I'm lucky. Quick loading times would be amazing.
[2022-12-08 16:10:07] <cabbagetits> waiting ten minutes to SPAWN ON FORK can fuck off

[2022-12-08 16:10:17] <NextDoorGuy> man eft players really are into CBT apparently

[2022-12-08 16:10:20] <DonLirion> that true deadly.. sometimes i have 3 hours free im like oh yay enough time to play, but after 3 hours i have done like 5 or 6 raids.. not pleased at all
[2022-12-08 16:10:21] <%+onedrop1> how is tarkov these days haven't played or watched in a while

[2022-12-08 16:10:37] <%Emperors_Crusade> Yup. That’s what makes Tarkov diff to other shoot as. The stress of dying
[2022-12-08 16:10:38] <grundlelobster> time spent not playing should never be a good thing.

[2022-12-08 16:10:43] <%MuffinSpectre> Imagine the queue was secretly just a random timer to inflate the value of time

[2022-12-08 16:10:51] <%red_leader1192> this is also another thing that kills tarkov for me. this god damn rain

[2022-12-08 16:49:17] <PantsOfChicken> Finding the ocean is worth it. Eventually you'll need to travel for ores, but probably want to easily get them back to a home base.

[2022-12-08 17:08:23] <%+Dboren> Not to be a backseat douche but your floor tiles shouldn't be on the ground. you need to put down beams first. It adds structural support and keeps your floor from getting weather damage
[2022-12-08 17:08:27] <+screetus> roof next then walls
[2022-12-08 17:08:29] <MrBREEKY> let the man build

[2022-12-08 18:18:27] <%+GigaaRat> I had to traverse 5000 miles to find the location of the second boss on my playthrough
[2022-12-08 18:18:27] <+offroadercat> the 4th boss is hard AF
[2022-12-08 18:18:35] <%+Overcast22> Looked cool as fuck
[2022-12-08 18:18:35] <H4WK69> 2nd boss is the first proper boss
[2022-12-08 18:18:37] <%+SneakyBast> Does this mean the trolls are coming for him at night now

[2022-12-08 18:18:46] <%+GigaaRat> trying to find the location thing for the second boss can be the hardest part in my experience
[2022-12-08 18:18:46] <jtkwelite2022> Small hand company has it tho!!
[2022-12-08 18:18:47] <EliasCoffman> And now do it again to hang second trophy above the chimney.

[2022-12-08 18:19:13] <%+silvoan> bonemass is a lot easier with clubs

[2022-12-08 18:39:08] <+OldGreg859> Its an advantage but I definitely don't see it as p2w. You're not landing your shots or progressing through a map easier with a large stash or secure container.

[2022-12-08 18:39:28] <+I_Am_TriLLo> teh amount of time in tarkov, EOD was a no brainer
[2022-12-08 18:39:29] <%+RussDom13> honestly i think ive had the most fun ive every had in video games in tarkov, but god do i hate it
[2022-12-08 18:39:33] <%prkr_ae> just get hthe cheap version, you can upgrade and pay the difference later if you want to
[2022-12-08 18:39:42] <Ronybeth53> My advice is buy the standard edition and if you hate yourself enough to play a lot then upgrade to EOD :)

[2022-12-08 18:45:24] <%ContinualTripod> So does this game have a built in goal or is it more self directed/sandbox?
[2022-12-08 18:45:27] <ftnGalli> BibleThump
[2022-12-08 18:45:36] <%$Warbeast_0> you need to settle and build a base. You'll need to start storing stuff
[2022-12-08 18:45:45] <%+SpacedTuna> Aright time to build a new base ha
[2022-12-08 18:45:47] <$SlowCause> make boat :D
[2022-12-08 18:45:49] <%MarineMiske> just relocate the home homie
[2022-12-08 18:45:50] <%+Deaths_Vulture> @ContinualTripod there is a progression of biomes/bosses
[2022-12-08 18:45:52] <%Mr_Brys> yeah black forest is probably closer...this is way too far
[2022-12-08 18:45:54] <%j_mauser> @ContinualTripod its progression based. to get into the next (harder) biome you need to get certain gear
[2022-12-08 18:45:55] <%+Chalkstix> just build another base
[2022-12-08 18:45:57] <RasDingo> Is the new valheim update out?
[2022-12-08 18:46:01] <%+commandoism> you can dig where the stones are in a boat shape to find treasure
[2022-12-08 18:46:06] <Pestimism> @ContinualTripod The bosses sort of gate your level of progress and you work through each era as you go, lots of progression not pure sandbox
[2022-12-08 18:46:08] <%ContinualTripod> Got it, thanks guys
[2022-12-08 18:46:09] <+Athasin> @ContinualTripod The goal is to kill the bosses but how quickly you do that is up to you
[2022-12-08 18:46:09] <heeyysteve> can you switch from local to closed server status with a world or no?
[2022-12-08 18:46:09] <+bestname_noother> have you checked out Zero Sievert yet? Single player isometric Tarkov with a Stalker vibe
[2022-12-08 18:46:09] <%fake_based> @Deadlyslob you should get up to boat status and use that to explore
[2022-12-08 18:46:10] <ripneoez> you gonna play wow today? or night
[2022-12-08 18:46:11] <%+GrizZzlyG> @ContinualTripod There are different Biomes / habitats that get progressivly harder & have bosses in them
[2022-12-08 18:46:12] <+sususasa> vlaheim!!!
[2022-12-08 18:46:16] <%j_mauser> @ContinualTripod each biome has a boss that you need to beat to progress

[2022-12-08 18:46:27] <arberkuqi1> New World is better than valheim

[2022-12-08 18:47:02] <%+tomo___1> i think they added a bunch of stuff since then
[2022-12-08 18:47:06] <%$Warbeast_0> Such a great game
[2022-12-08 18:47:12] <%ContinualTripod> Seems like I’d like this, I enjoy these kinda games but have a hard time when they’re pure sandbox
[2022-12-08 18:47:16] <ripneoez> you play wow today or night?

[2022-12-08 18:47:50] <+Boats4life> this is such a great game you can solo it or enjoy with other people! Most underrated game in a long time
[2022-12-08 18:47:53] <%$Warbeast_0> good idea

[2022-12-08 19:55:17] <+thedefiningmoment> @Deadlyslob  you can build the torch from inventory.
[2022-12-08 19:55:17] <%j_mauser> @b0omshkado0m well, technically you are correct NODDERS KEKW
[2022-12-08 19:55:22] <%+twistedaxe__> parry with any weapon
[2022-12-08 19:55:23] <+ZomBeastMode> @Th3Damus We never had an issue, the server is your computer, so it might be your system
[2022-12-08 19:55:28] <%$MetalCoil> need a shield f
[2022-12-08 19:55:34] <+dizzying_fall> you can parry with just blocking, there are just modifiers to the window based on the shield
[2022-12-08 19:55:35] <Sam_Hall_> bronze buckler best shield, change my mind
[2022-12-08 19:55:39] <x_jdot> yep
[2022-12-08 19:55:44] <%spleen_eater> @nightshift_2 Oh yeah. It's my second playthrough. Haven't played since it first dropped.
[2022-12-08 19:55:48] <%+twistedaxe__> at first
[2022-12-08 19:55:48] <%j_mauser> but you get less damage with a shield
[2022-12-08 19:55:50] <x_jdot> just a smaller window i think, and take damage possibly with low block skill
[2022-12-08 19:55:53] <%$areiseye> @Sam_Hall_ bronze buckler + club
[2022-12-08 19:55:56] <%$MetalCoil> you take alot morew stagger dmg
[2022-12-08 19:55:58] <%+GRiF_tastic> only if the attack exceeds the block of the weapon you are using to block
[2022-12-08 19:56:11] <Noctyrnal> I believe there's a parry-bonus stat on your tools as well
[2022-12-08 19:56:14] <nightshift_2> @spleen_eater nice, my first playthrough was abt 100hrs solo, then I made a server with friends and it was so much more fun

[2022-12-08 20:15:23] <thrillhowse> Someone might have mentioned this before but workbenches and their surrounding area stop monsters from spawning. If you make a bunch of work benches around your property, they will stop spawning so close and aggroing.

[2022-12-08 20:17:09] <Equites2> They changed that in Dragonflight, it caps out at mythic gear now, but you have to clear higher levels to get there.

[2022-12-08 20:20:57] <+wikidus_> did we figure out how to make a chimney / proper roofs? im still gettin smoked out :(
[2022-12-08 20:20:57] <%+Bpwoods> Do you still have to find the trader to be able to get a fishing rod? Or have they made fishing rods craftable with the new update?
[2022-12-08 20:20:58] <%tee_money757> @Oktabia you can tell shes from this channel.... peppStank

[2022-12-08 20:21:41] <Sad___People> Youve been playing that game for so long
[2022-12-08 20:21:43] <%+siriustuck> Just be a full time Variety Andy
[2022-12-08 20:21:49] <%$Warbeast_0> You're not alone bro.. same here
[2022-12-08 20:21:50] <%tocsin7> Been watching you for years for Tarkov and am now loving the other games you've been playing. Play what you enjoy and we'll still come to hang out!
[2022-12-08 20:21:50] <%+Bpwoods> Smaller than that and the smoke physically can't exit.
[2022-12-08 20:21:51] <%SchurkjeBoefje> attitude andy
[2022-12-08 20:21:53] <%ledski> you dont think you are beyond just tarkov now? you could be a variety streamer easy you dont think?
[2022-12-08 20:21:55] <%PurpleRiboflavin> kappa not required lol
[2022-12-08 20:21:55] <nightshift_2> maybe you need to skip a wipe or 2
[2022-12-08 20:22:02] <+drewwidd> You’re not the problem, tark is the problem
[2022-12-08 20:22:04] <+wikidus_> @bpnwoods when it rains is when i run inito issues with that
[2022-12-08 20:22:05] <InnerZ__> the quest: have fun
[2022-12-08 20:22:17] <%+SpiderManMan1> Be the ball and throw yourself.. yeah

[2022-12-08 20:22:25] <+Red_Beard_Army> wait we're getting streets this wipe?
[2022-12-08 20:22:27] <ep1r3s> Streets KEKW
[2022-12-08 20:22:32] <%+finalmiker> i would actually be surprised if streets gets released
[2022-12-08 20:22:32] <%N0tS0An0n> it's always the shoreline quests that make me want to quit the most
[2022-12-08 20:22:32] <robz_mbie> I think we were over wiped end of last year and feeling the blues
[2022-12-08 20:22:32] <%PurpleRiboflavin> oh so street is this wipe ? im out of the loop srry
[2022-12-08 20:22:33] <Hizack> inb4 Streets is delayed again
[2022-12-08 20:22:34] <+xNew> Odds are on streets that the boss apc powerpoints across the map and shoots you through the wall
[2022-12-08 20:22:36] <%Fuego_> Bro I too am burnt tf out of tarkov. I’d rather listen to this game in the background instead of crunchy tarkov sounds anyday
[2022-12-08 20:22:49] <+beastmaster3o3> I've never actually watched you play Tarkov lol. Started when you were playing Cities
[2022-12-08 20:22:57] <+Red_Beard_Army> are you screwing with us
[2022-12-08 20:22:59] <%+Bpwoods> It looks like they've nerfed archery and made the bows draw speed really slow in this game. Or is it just the beginner bow is bad and I've forgotten?
[2022-12-08 20:23:04] <%+spacepunch_> your MOM is confirmed @Deadlyslob hnnngh
[2022-12-08 20:23:07] <Hizack> It's happening COPIUM

[2022-12-08 20:23:08] <dohtENV> I think all the hype and let down with the in game trader and stuff this wipe hurt the game

[2022-12-08 20:23:12] <@%Mossberg10> your little "camp" needs a defensive wall @Deadlyslob

[2022-12-08 20:23:22] <yaboyjoekozz> @Bpwoods the beginner bow is trash
[2022-12-08 20:23:25] <@%daddyCASH> And a deep trench
[2022-12-08 20:23:28] <%+Silo_0> The cities streams were awesome
[2022-12-08 20:23:33] <%PurpleRiboflavin> variety ftw is my opinion lol
[2022-12-08 20:23:38] <%rex20101> variety games have been great
[2022-12-08 20:23:38] <%j_mauser> @wikidus_ you need to work with poles. on top you put a roof
[2022-12-08 20:23:40] <%+chudleybumpkins> My summer car is the GOAT
[2022-12-08 20:23:43] <DagBTW> The variety has been great NODDERS
[2022-12-08 20:23:43] <%+tomo___1> variety is fun
[2022-12-08 20:23:43] <%+mrclean606> i started watching you play about 2/3 of the way through the weasyl  bannerlord play through...been coming back ever since.
[2022-12-08 20:23:45] <%TheYield> Are they doing anything with the quests this wipe?
[2022-12-08 20:23:45] <%+SpacedTuna> Okay variety streamer
[2022-12-08 20:23:49] <%+Bpwoods> @yaboyjoekozz Yea just seems like they've made the draw speed slower from what I remember. but it's been 1.5 years since
[2022-12-08 20:23:49] <%+subatomiic> variety streamer life widepeepoHappy
[2022-12-08 20:23:52] <%+Bpwoods> I've played

[2022-12-08 20:23:58] <%+rodic87> cities was good but i enjoyed barry small hands and wyseal the insane more i think :D
[2022-12-08 20:23:59] <%+Silo_0> Variety has been great
[2022-12-08 20:23:59] <%+LegitimateBeef> we need another moose knuckler stream
[2022-12-08 20:24:02] <%+Lothurr> they will release streets and then it'll not work and then it'll not come out until next wipe KEKW
[2022-12-08 20:24:04] <Captain_Peesauce> Game deserves to go down. And not even because it's Russian and the devs openly support war on Ukraine, but mainly because they just refuse to fix stuff (or simply can't at this point). The game is broken in too many ways.
[2022-12-08 20:24:10] <+generalmills312> jussayin i found you through Tarkov and have enjoyed watching you play other games even more. Streets will be insane though so LFG
[2022-12-08 20:24:12] <%+rodic87> MY SUMMER CAR tho was peak variety for me personally.
[2022-12-08 20:24:14] <+hexedlotus> streets confirmed but we have no idea how its gonna look and feel lmao
[2022-12-08 20:24:15] <%SchurkjeBoefje> ddHuh
[2022-12-08 20:24:16] <+beastmaster3o3> Fire arrows should just give you cooked meats
[2022-12-08 20:24:17] <%misterpants887> @Bpwoods I think they did that in an interrmediate patch a few months back to try and nerf the bow a bit
[2022-12-08 20:24:18] <%+SpacedTuna> Wel I can tell you that I’ll be diving into some green and valheim tonight because of this stream
[2022-12-08 20:24:19] <%SchurkjeBoefje> the fire didnt give it away?

[2022-12-08 20:24:26] <%+siriustuck> @Captain_Peesauce That is all factually false.
[2022-12-08 20:24:26] <+pleasedpig> fire arrows can cook the pigs :)
[2022-12-08 20:24:27] <%+rodic87> your ability to storytell for your crazy characters is what makes it great
[2022-12-08 20:24:29] <%+Lothurr> @Captain_Peesauce wait when did they say they support war in ukraine....
[2022-12-08 20:24:30] <%+SpiderManMan1> My Summer Car was epic here deadlyLove
[2022-12-08 20:24:31] <+hexedlotus> streets of tarkov more like cul-de-sac
[2022-12-08 20:24:45] <ep1r3s> @Lothurr that is so plausible KEKW
[2022-12-08 20:24:46] <%+rodic87> oh that's convenient
[2022-12-08 20:24:48] <+panther_191> They cool any meat you can collect
[2022-12-08 20:24:48] <%+Travisty024> @Captain_Peesauce lol what
[2022-12-08 20:24:50] <AkosJaccik> In situations like these it's always helpful to remember the advice we've got from Teimo.

[2022-12-08 20:24:52] <stillforlorn> Have you built a farm yet Deadly? Push piggies into a fenced area and then close them off, they multiply
[2022-12-08 20:24:52] <+panther_191> cook*
[2022-12-08 20:24:53] <+SemperGumby8> yeah if animals die on fire it cooks the meat
[2022-12-08 20:24:53] <%+Bpwoods> @misterpants887 Disappointing kinda but understandable for sure. Bow was so strong when the game first got popular.
[2022-12-08 20:25:02] <%+Lothurr> @Lothurr lol right, as sad as it is, it could easily happen with them
[2022-12-08 20:25:05] <%SchurkjeBoefje> MSC stream is undoubtedly the most consistentely funny stream content ive ever watched
[2022-12-08 20:25:12] <+pleasedpig> I might be wrong, does fire have them drop cooked meat?

[2022-12-08 20:25:31] <+dizzying_fall> need a bronze axe first for fine wood
[2022-12-08 20:25:35] <Captain_Peesauce> @lothurr their key developer even got wounded fighting in Ukraine. look it up

[2022-12-08 20:25:40] <AkosJaccik> Fingers crossed for My Winter Car
[2022-12-08 20:25:42] <%Chicken_Widdle> you need 10 cert cores, to ramp up production
[2022-12-08 20:25:50] <%+Bpwoods> I feel like the highest priority, once you have decent armor, is to just sail straight south to the edge of the map and set up a portal there for infinite coal/cores.
[2022-12-08 20:25:51] <%Degen_Hardt> one tech step away
[2022-12-08 20:26:02] <Captain_Peesauce> @siriustuck because?

[2022-12-08 20:26:10] <+Ujjio> it's only 2 cores for a portal

[2022-12-08 20:26:11] <+dizzying_fall> portal only 2 cores

[2022-12-08 20:26:14] <+Slonkeydonk> 2 per portal
[2022-12-08 20:26:14] <%+Silo_0> A portal is two cores
[2022-12-08 20:26:15] <%+Bpwoods> OH ok
[2022-12-08 20:26:16] <%Chicken_Widdle> portal is only 2

[2022-12-08 20:26:23] <%+siriustuck> @Captain_Peesauce even if this were true... they are conscripting people into the military. They don't have a choice. They have said nothing pro or against the war, at risk of their lives.

[2022-12-08 20:38:11] <Trydim> boar sausage is great deadlyslob
[2022-12-08 20:38:12] <paradox_zen> boar meat is delish
[2022-12-08 20:38:14] <%+SneakyBast> Boar meat tastes great if cooked right.
[2022-12-08 20:38:14] <InnerZ__> boar is yummy
[2022-12-08 20:38:15] <+KPeso> are there other people on this map with him?
[2022-12-08 20:38:15] <%$Warbeast_0> Wild boars are delicious
[2022-12-08 20:38:21] <@%xRapture> taste like pork??
[2022-12-08 20:38:21] <+Boats4life> if you suck at cooking then sure anything taste like shit
[2022-12-08 20:38:21] <%npc2453> Killing feral boars is not so much hunting as culling cause the mass amount of damage they do
[2022-12-08 20:38:22] <%+the_dock87> @deadlyslob my buddy just did it like a month ago.
[2022-12-08 20:38:27] <wravey> yea sausage for sure
[2022-12-08 20:38:30] <$Literal_Soup> It pretty much only makes sausage

[2022-12-08 20:38:34] <burttsyburtt> Never had a pig in the ground?
[2022-12-08 20:38:35] <%+spacepunch_> i mean aint boars just .... pig
[2022-12-08 20:38:37] <%j_mauser> @KPeso nope. but you can play with others
[2022-12-08 20:38:38] <%SchurkjeBoefje> @Bpwoods i always dig a moat to protect against troll but youre right theyre a fucking PITA when they raid
[2022-12-08 20:38:40] <%+spacepunch_> so in the end all youre eating is pork?!
[2022-12-08 20:38:45] <%+LegitimateBeef> Mmmm taint
[2022-12-08 20:38:48] <Stingray427> We have a problem w them in FL but not as bad as TX, meat is slightly gamey over hog
[2022-12-08 20:38:49] <+bamfhealer> the meat takes prepping, mainly, and I swear by this, trapping the boar, then removing their nuts and letting them live on your farm for 1 month before you actually slaughter them.
[2022-12-08 20:38:53] <%420suckit> it's just pre-seared
[2022-12-08 20:38:54] <nightshift_2> I had wild boar in Italy, was pretty good
[2022-12-08 20:38:55] <%MuffinSpectre> yes
[2022-12-08 20:38:58] <+bamfhealer> legit the only way to make wild boar worth a fuck
[2022-12-08 20:38:59] <%+Quigleyman73> dude, wild boar irl are mean and very hard to kill
[2022-12-08 20:39:11] <%boldfacecole> The flavor is just a little boar-ing to me
[2022-12-08 20:39:13] <schn1539> It’s a new event. The bats will kill your farm animals at the base. Your boar farm marked on your map would be the place to build one. Fix the fences, feed them, tame them. It’s far enough away that it won’t be effected by the events.
[2022-12-08 20:39:15] <%+TallTaleHunter> @spacepunch_ wild boar is vastly different from farm pig
[2022-12-08 20:39:17] <iTexanWaffle> you gotta cut there nuts off as soon as you kill them so the testosterone doesnt get to the meat
[2022-12-08 20:39:18] <%+Bpwoods> @SchurkjeBoefje Fair, I've never dug a moat tbh. Always just seemed kinda cheesy but it was mostly because I'm lazy af and would rather build something cool than just.... dig.

[2022-12-08 20:39:24] <%LostFriend> common way is to use thermals and just light up a hoard of them
[2022-12-08 20:39:25] <%j_mauser> @Quigleyman73 well, i surely wouldn't fight the with just a club LUL
[2022-12-08 20:39:42] <+bamfhealer> @Quigleyman73 I always bring a side arm when hunting boar as they do not fuck around
[2022-12-08 20:39:49] <n3wtpond> My coworkers here in south FL hunt boat with pit bulls. Like bird dogs. But boar dogs.
[2022-12-08 20:39:53] <%SchurkjeBoefje> @Bpwoods well, you dig first, then you build something cool :P
[2022-12-08 20:39:54] <%+TallTaleHunter> @spacepunch_ Yeah, absolutely, been hunting all my life, and there's a distinct difference
[2022-12-08 20:39:55] <arberkuqi1> the melody is so chill
[2022-12-08 20:40:01] <+bamfhealer> @Quigleyman73 rifle for the shot then side arm out when your lookin for em
[2022-12-08 20:40:02] <%+Bpwoods> I have no idea what kind of pig it was, but I went to an actual luau in Hawaii when I was there in 2007 and they roasted an entire hog over a giant fire. Best fuckin pork I've ever had irl.
[2022-12-08 20:40:08] <+hamburger250> thats why we hunt them
[2022-12-08 20:40:09] <+KPeso> that tree was a real beech to cut down

[2022-12-08 20:40:18] <%+spacepunch_> @TallTaleHunter ive never eaten anything other than what you can buy in the store lol im curious about what boar tastes like now
