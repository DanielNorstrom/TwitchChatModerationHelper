[2022-12-10 00:03:21] <ChaoticCheshire24> Spinocrocodile...
[2022-12-10 00:03:22] <INUMEI_VT> I had one and it made me instantly feel better

[2022-12-10 00:03:32] <ChaoticCheshire24> who was in charge of translating this...
[2022-12-10 00:03:42] <greenpotatothatdraws> @isabellathepancakee once you drink the bottled water you can never drink tap water the same again
[2022-12-10 00:03:53] <%admin_yee> are you adverse to shots?
[2022-12-10 00:03:54] <ChaoticCheshire24> aroboCursed
[2022-12-10 00:04:05] <DreamOnNeon> i saw they have like these pure oxygen canisters that people inhale. apparently athletes use them for a performance boost cause it's pure O2
[2022-12-10 00:04:10] <INUMEI_VT> It‚Äôs so uncomfortable to lay still with a giant needle in your arm
[2022-12-10 00:04:14] <theskyismylimit> I still need to get my shots...
[2022-12-10 00:04:17] <%+afternooncellica> i mean what kinda stabbing we talking about :)
[2022-12-10 00:04:18] <%+isabellathepancakee> @greenpotatothatdraws honestly i used to love tap water cause we had good tap water, and my grandparents have filtered tap water, but our tap water is disgusting
[2022-12-10 00:04:23] <%admin_yee> i mean if you get a tattoo sometimes you develop a like to the sensation

[2022-12-10 00:05:45] <INUMEI_VT> When I get my blood drawn I pass out like crazy and they put the needle and made me walk to go do a urine sample and I almost blacked out
[2022-12-10 00:05:56] <ChaoticCheshire24> I just skimmed through this
[2022-12-10 00:06:06] <iceangel_52> How can you not take pills?

[2022-12-10 00:31:43] <Blazetri> i belive the reason is that scara as a single entity can not single handinly remove himself, as it took nahida to remove rukkadevata

[2022-12-10 01:44:51] <commando_pan> The Fatui in Mondstadt say the sixth harbinger‚Äôs seat has been vacant for years
[2022-12-10 01:45:24] <commando_pan> Yea ig so
[2022-12-10 01:45:41] VIEWERS: 190
[2022-12-10 01:45:42] <dreamyumechan> theory say it god of time
[2022-12-10 01:45:57] <ChaoticCheshire24> I was thinking the Heavenly Principles
[2022-12-10 01:45:57] <%+Jenrou> If you have Ei or Childe or Yae... you might wanna check their voicelines about Kunikuzushi / Balladeer coryyeeHina
[2022-12-10 01:45:58] <+AtlasBigBoy> Lore streamer said it is most likely to be Istaroth the goddess of time
[2022-12-10 01:45:59] <%naomu_> I heard a theory that it is the hydro archon
[2022-12-10 01:46:04] <%+isabellathepancakee> @dreamyumechan there is no god of time tho grimmi14OHNO
[2022-12-10 01:46:09] <iatekaeyaassinstantregret> the harbringers just hate even numbers ig
[2022-12-10 01:46:10] <giiih_7> istaroth????
[2022-12-10 01:46:13] <ChaoticCheshire24> @naomu_ that was my second guess
[2022-12-10 01:46:14] <BookOfLilacs> not me just now getting to the part of the quest you were at when i joined stream
[2022-12-10 01:46:15] <dreamyumechan> mostly is istaroth goddess of time
[2022-12-10 01:46:16] <%+isabellathepancakee> i dont think there is
[2022-12-10 01:46:17] <meabh_b> istaroth is one assumption
[2022-12-10 01:46:22] <riolu124> focalor
[2022-12-10 01:46:25] <Swedi> who's istaroth?
[2022-12-10 01:46:27] <meabh_b> goddess of fate and time
[2022-12-10 01:46:34] <%+isabellathepancakee> WAIT UR RIGHT I REMEMBER NOW
[2022-12-10 01:46:43] <Aquaespeon> So basically changing irminsul only changes the cognition of events that came to be, but the outcome stays the same?
[2022-12-10 01:46:45] <%+isabellathepancakee> wasnt istaroth mentioned in eis story quest
[2022-12-10 01:47:00] <meabh_b> @isabellathepancakee she was
[2022-12-10 01:47:11] <%+isabellathepancakee> @isabellathepancakee i see i see i remember now
[2022-12-10 01:47:37] <john_plays2> Hey what did you name your Scaramouche?
[2022-12-10 01:47:41] VIEWERS: 190
[2022-12-10 01:47:43] <%+isabellathepancakee> i think what the voice was saying is the outcome is the same, basically the same thing as how everyone in tatarasuna who died still died
[2022-12-10 01:47:56] <+AtlasBigBoy> Just going to point out that in a book in Genshin istaroth is written backwards so irminsul does not mind it
[2022-12-10 01:47:58] <dreamyumechan> Earls Rose uwu
[2022-12-10 01:48:13] <BookOfLilacs> quick run
[2022-12-10 01:48:15] <john_plays2> I bet that anonymous voice was the heavenly principles or ‚Äúthe unknown God‚Äù
[2022-12-10 01:48:21] <ZeaDraa> Nahida story quest in the dream world
[2022-12-10 01:48:22] <%naomu_> it was when the traveller went outside of sumeru city
[2022-12-10 01:48:26] <ChaoticCheshire24> and it's finished
[2022-12-10 01:48:33] <dreamyumechan> sumero dream repeat quest the moment
[2022-12-10 01:48:34] <iatekaeyaassinstantregret> hopefully there‚Äôs some epic resurrection Barbruh shenanigans that resurrect signora for signora wanters
[2022-12-10 01:48:39] <%+isabellathepancakee> @john_plays2 ive been wondering this honestly, but i havent seen anyone comparing the voices online yet so idk
[2022-12-10 01:48:48] <theskyismylimit> yup
[2022-12-10 01:48:50] <ChaoticCheshire24> yeah

[2022-12-10 01:49:02] <%+Jenrou> Yeah we're used to waiting a year or more for him
[2022-12-10 01:49:03] <ZeaDraa> next would be Dein quest right?
[2022-12-10 01:49:08] <artyisntokay> hey again!!!

[2022-12-10 01:50:00] <yobo93> I named mine Suisei - Japanese for (Freddy) Mercury
[2022-12-10 01:50:03] <%+Jenrou> I should name him "Your Bestie"
