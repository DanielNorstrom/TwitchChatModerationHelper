[2023-01-07 10:35:11] <@%TheMoenia> A petition by the game's Japanese fanbase, backed by artist Kamui Fujiwara and co-composer Miyoko Takaoka, began in July 2021 to either re-release or remaster Terranigma. This fan-led effort renewed speculation on the status of the rights to Quintet's games. According to Fujiwara, Quintet president Tomoyoshi Miyazaki had "disappeared" to his knowledge; he speculated this was why the rights to republish the game were complicated, that Miyazaki was not available for contact.

After you do that, you're told that you now have to go bring back life to the world, starting with plants, and eventually you bring back humanity, which you then guide through history

[2023-01-07 13:47:33] <!%+mister_mingo> Megami Tensei is the original. They were two games based on an original novel. After they ran out of source material (after Megami Tensei II), they made Shin Megami Tensei (New Megami Tensei) with its own story and world. And then Persona spins off from that style of gameplay.
