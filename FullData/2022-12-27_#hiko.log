[2022-12-27 19:22:52] <coldgoat1> @Hiko i run on the treadmill with Zwift, it makes it a bit more interesting
[2022-12-27 19:22:53] <%NIKE_QQ> IMO
[2022-12-27 19:22:58] <+VentYaDig> hehe @v2_fresh
[2022-12-27 19:23:04] <+regular_brett> Ice skating might be the best exercise
[2022-12-27 19:23:05] <stringystrings> riding bike outside is fun
[2022-12-27 19:23:06] <Antpond> Eh not your fault don’t be sorry. I signed up for the long work lol. I work security for multiple venues. Not complaining coz I ain’t working all week.
[2022-12-27 19:23:10] <@%Eurazn> @nike_qq factual
[2022-12-27 19:23:12] <v2_fresh> Running outside is nice but treadmill no
[2022-12-27 19:23:15] <Romperoni> i like running outside much more than on a treadmill
[2022-12-27 19:23:20] <stringystrings> Is peloton live?
[2022-12-27 19:23:25] <%AirGuitarRokin> @Antpond make that money brother
[2022-12-27 19:23:29] <Vikings22> Treadmills are great. Do the one that changes terrain/incline while you go. Walking is better than running imo
