[2022-12-06 16:26:33] <%+ParanoidCorgi> Pokemon memory, I got OG silver before it released cause the teen selling it broke street date, I was the cool kid for that week
[2022-12-06 16:26:33] <Proteus42> During my 40 min lunch hour in middle school i would play Pokemon Gold.
[2022-12-06 16:26:35] <+Mantiswarrior99> i remember the first time i played pokemon, it was pokemon yello grandparents had a gameboy color!
[2022-12-06 16:26:40] <Appleman6> I found 2 shiny durants in the same room and in the same hour when I was grinding in Balck 1 nuzlocke

[2022-12-06 16:26:45] <!%+AirahsELL> i went to a catholic school and pokemon was regarded as demonic so we basically had a hidden cabal of people playing the card game and trading behind the school.
[2022-12-06 16:26:51] <%Sotetsu> It was Red and Blue, originally.
[2022-12-06 16:26:52] <jackdexterishere> i remember one time when the boys had a fight inside the restroom over a girl
[2022-12-06 16:26:56] <aod0736> I have my pokewalkers somewhere
[2022-12-06 16:26:58] <%Furudehan> Green was Japan only, Blue in America. Remakes went back to Green.

[2022-12-06 16:27:01] <@%BlackCharcz> My first memory of Pokemon is me skipping school to play Blue that was on view in Tesco for 8 hours at a time, just to have my save erased as soon as I left
[2022-12-06 16:27:02] <Rorckor> both
[2022-12-06 16:27:04] <%$ipponsky> Red blue in US, Red Green in Japan, so both were right
[2022-12-06 16:27:06] <jvaad> My dad didn't want me getting into it for some reason, so I missed that massive cultural phenomenon. It's alright, saved a lot of money, I reckon.
[2022-12-06 16:27:13] <sleepy_moohnie> i lost my pokewalker in a college bathroom somewhere

[2022-12-06 16:27:39] <+spidey7003> when I was a kid my friend took catch em all literally and would catch every wild pokemon he saw and it annoyed me for some reason
[2022-12-06 16:27:40] <%ABRAoriginal> I've been playing pokemon since Red and Blue. still have my red cart with my name written on it. only stopped playing them when they started releasing on the switch.

[2022-12-06 16:27:57] <jackdexterishere> I used to play pokemon under the bedsheet covers at night to not get caught
[2022-12-06 16:27:59] <Appleman6> I tried to put my Pok√©mon in the pokewalker back in my game, but my Ds died right after transfer, so now the game doesn‚Äôt think it has the Pok√©mon and the Pok√©mon is completely gone

[2022-12-06 16:32:48] <%Tylphen> they've become STUPID MONEY
[2022-12-06 16:32:51] <Proteus42> I actually bought a 2nd copy of A Link to the Past GBA just so that I could play the Four Swords mode with my friend. I had him beat the game too. LUL
[2022-12-06 16:32:55] <!%+AirahsELL> was it a real arcade or an "arcade" that is just mobile games on cabinets?
[2022-12-06 16:32:56] <%Furudehan> House of the Dead is a great arcade game.
[2022-12-06 16:32:57] <aod0736> ammo is expensive*
[2022-12-06 16:32:57] <+spidey7003> oh when I was a kid when a staus move said "it didn't affect the enemy" I thought it was immune so I wouldn't try a second time
[2022-12-06 16:32:58] <TalkingObject> But do you want to shoot people?

[2022-12-06 16:33:03] <%CaptainHounde> Murder?!
[2022-12-06 16:33:06] <%$ipponsky> in my country it was hard to buy games too. a normal 60$ game costed 200$ in our country, so we could only buy one when going abroad

[2022-12-06 16:33:24] <%Melnazar> I'd like to submit to the court this stream as evidence for Oli's murder at an arcade
[2022-12-06 16:33:25] <BigBoss_Arts> A few years ago Nintendo literally got people to buy and play with cardboard, anything is possible
[2022-12-06 16:33:26] <jackdexterishere> Imagine Oli goes to vacation just to come back with a criminal record

[2022-12-06 17:21:53] <!%+AirahsELL> psychic is generally strong typewise and wrecks poison and fighting. dark and ghost do a lot to it but this cave is full of things gardevoir can destroy with the moves it has

[2022-12-06 17:23:53] <%Furudehan> It's only a problem if you're pvping. It never mattered.
[2022-12-06 17:23:53] <DictatorDuck> they replaced them for a reason
[2022-12-06 17:23:54] <%+Yggy_Ch> well you'd be glad to know that they've gotten rid of them in the newer games
[2022-12-06 17:24:02] <!%+AirahsELL> they are which is why they replaced it with a bike lizard that just learns stuff from eating sandwiches in gen 9

[2022-12-06 17:24:23] <DictatorDuck> was it sun and moon that did away with them
[2022-12-06 17:24:24] <@%Athagorn> Then again I've never played any Pokemon game, so I have no horse on that race.

[2022-12-06 17:27:19] <%GinTamashiVT> Yeah ice isn't great against steel
[2022-12-06 17:27:19] <!%+AirahsELL> ground fighting and fire beat steel. ice is weak to it.
[2022-12-06 17:27:24] <lanturn1> ice is not good against steel
[2022-12-06 17:27:27] <marklarphd> Steel is an interesting type for a pokemon with teeth. Teeth are incredibly hard. Most of the mammal fossil record is just teeth.
[2022-12-06 17:27:30] <!%Fuzzgotgames> When in doubt, unless the opponent is flying, use ground. It is strong against a lot of thigns

[2022-12-06 17:57:59] <%CaptainHounde> A Spudnut is likely a Potato Based Donut due to Spud being a term for Potatoes

[2022-12-06 19:05:39] <!%Fuzzgotgames> There is a lot of info even though it's come up before, you cant expect someone to recall everything

[2022-12-06 19:05:56] <@%Athagorn> This game has a lot to remember!
[2022-12-06 19:05:58] <shaun_the_sheep_bah> Pokemon with little girls? Sounds like something that could land you in jail

[2022-12-06 19:06:25] <!%AirahsELL> @fuzzgotgames yes you can. im dumb as a box of rocks and somehow remember all this without consciously committing it to memory
[2022-12-06 19:06:35] <@%Athagorn> Pokemon and Attack types, the speed of the moves, and so on...
[2022-12-06 19:06:42] <!%Fuzzgotgames> That's you. Everyone's built different
[2022-12-06 19:07:02] <!%AirahsELL> its mostly just type effectiveness you need to worry about in these games
[2022-12-06 19:07:03] <CEOApollo> @airahsell this is literally her second pokemon game lol

[2022-12-06 19:07:28] <@%Athagorn> I've never played pokemon, but for me, it seems they overcomplicate things with every new iteration of the game.
[2022-12-06 19:07:43] <%+MarthTheLithe1> Ghost and Dark
[2022-12-06 19:07:44] <!%AirahsELL> @ceoapollo im aware, and she is by far not the worst. i watch someone who forgets type matchups every 10 seconds.
[2022-12-06 19:07:48] <!%Fuzzgotgames> Ghost is ineffective against steel
[2022-12-06 19:07:50] <@%Athagorn> Let's go!!
[2022-12-06 19:07:51] <LordKotsu> so I checked and Grudge is when the pokemon faint, the attack that killed it gets depleted of its PP
[2022-12-06 19:08:00] <!%Fuzzgotgames> you bring out a tank, you're good
[2022-12-06 19:08:07] <!%Fuzzgotgames> you use crunch with flygon, you're good
[2022-12-06 19:08:12] <!%AirahsELL> @athagorn not really. most new gimmicks you can ignore.

[2022-12-06 19:09:59] <!%AirahsELL> @athagorn yeah. very few people do that and even now you dont need to do that. you just need some items to boost stats to max.
[2022-12-06 19:10:06] <%Cronofuge> @Athagorn They actually took out a LOT of the work that goes into that, you can just money your way to a "perfect" pokemon these days

[2022-12-06 19:10:24] <CEOApollo> @athagorn that‚Äôs just for PvP/shiny hunting. When just playing thru the story, you dont gotta worry about all that
[2022-12-06 19:10:33] <%Cronofuge> I still EV trained with the power items cause I ran out of money though
[2022-12-06 19:10:36] <!%AirahsELL> give a guy some bottle caps and feed your mon a mint. perfect mon in no time flat.
[2022-12-06 19:10:36] <%Wolffang_Amadeus_Mozart> It's actually kind of scary seeing her think for her self after seeing her rely on chat most of the game

[2022-12-06 19:10:52] <%Cronofuge> was wondering when that freeze would happen

[2022-12-06 19:12:03] <%$algeddon> @athagorn you also dont even remotely need to do any of the special training stuff to just play the game. it really only matters for competition

[2022-12-06 19:13:45] <@%owlishnick> Gardevoir might've done well there
[2022-12-06 19:13:49] <%ArcReaper_21> ^
[2022-12-06 19:13:53] <!%AirahsELL> ok oli you were incredibly wrong about dusclops. its a pure ghost with insane move coverage, like your Gardevoir with an electric move
[2022-12-06 19:13:58] <@%owlishnick> Good job though! Time for healing and ethers
[2022-12-06 19:14:01] <%Cronofuge> gardevoir would've gotten one shot
[2022-12-06 19:14:02] <%Wolffang_Amadeus_Mozart> not really
[2022-12-06 19:14:04] <!%Fuzzgotgames> So dusclops has the ability pressure, while you were fighting him he doubled your pp usage.
[2022-12-06 19:14:05] <Chaosheal> very smol pp
[2022-12-06 19:14:08] <Chugga1FanYT> There‚Äôs no such thing as a triple type.

[2022-12-06 19:14:26] <!%Fuzzgotgames> Keep an eye out for the message "This pokemon is exerting pressure". because that is the effect
[2022-12-06 19:14:36] <LordKotsu> so I checked and Grudge is when the pokemon faint, the attack that killed it gets depleted of its PP
[2022-12-06 19:14:37] <!%AirahsELL> PP Max also restores
[2022-12-06 19:14:37] <RoddySaysHello> haha you said berries

[2022-12-06 19:14:51] <!%Catbag> also check out Waterfall
[2022-12-06 19:14:59] <$HyperMetalix> some Pok√©mon just have moves outside of their type just for coverage
[2022-12-06 19:15:15] <!%Fuzzgotgames> I need to dip out, but I'm gonna watch the vod. YOU ARE AMAZING and you're gonna do this guaranteed
[2022-12-06 19:15:29] <LordKotsu> i mean swampert has an ice move without being ice type Kappa
[2022-12-06 19:15:31] <!%AirahsELL> yeah her last Dusclops only had one ghost move. the others were meant to just deal with anything else.

[2022-12-06 19:15:44] <!%AirahsELL> also ghosts are weak to other ghosts and darks

[2022-12-06 19:16:58] <!%AirahsELL> ghosts are a good defensive type. they are hard to deal with since you need to use another ghost in most cases to deal with it
[2022-12-06 19:17:01] <Chugga1FanYT> Ghost is weak to Dark and itself.

[2022-12-06 19:59:26] <trublu1003> you all know fairy types aren't in this game
[2022-12-06 19:59:33] <!%AirahsELL> altaria, flygon, and salamance were all 4x weak to ice. shelgon was 2x weak to it and kingdra only has a weakness to dragon
[2022-12-06 19:59:33] <R2leo> fairy doesnt exist yet
[2022-12-06 19:59:35] <$darrencecgj> wait till oli start collecting pokemon cards
[2022-12-06 19:59:36] <%Wolffang_Amadeus_Mozart> your flygon almost got killed by a ice attack, I'm surprise he lived

[2022-12-06 19:59:47] <Natal_KOG> nice reference
[2022-12-06 19:59:47] <$Taciturn_Tactics> So you sort of imagine dragons
[2022-12-06 19:59:53] <%+MarthTheLithe1> There are slight type weakness changes from this generation to the next.

[2022-12-06 20:34:14] <Appleman6> It‚Äôs a water team

[2022-12-06 20:35:05] <Proteus42> Hyper Potion the real MVP
[2022-12-06 20:35:10] <Temporal_Paradox> that hyperbeam hits hard, even with the level difference
[2022-12-06 20:35:29] <%$algeddon> The game isnt really over till you fight....Him
[2022-12-06 20:35:34] <PC_4S_H> He was firing off +2 Hyper Beams
[2022-12-06 20:35:42] <Appleman6> Why would they give the player such an over leveled Pok√©mon?
[2022-12-06 20:35:49] <%Wolffang_Amadeus_Mozart> I'm still impressed that gardevoir had a use in one of the fights

[2022-12-06 20:36:33] <%Wolffang_Amadeus_Mozart> fun fact: hyper beam is a physical attack in this game, makes no sense
