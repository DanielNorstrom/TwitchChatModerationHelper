[2023-01-03 14:41:33] <+StormRTA> low driven that angle almost always goes in btw
[2023-01-03 14:41:34] <sir7m> whattt
[2023-01-03 14:41:34] <%+Cordellyoung0000> Some go in some don‚Äôt there
[2023-01-03 14:41:38] <%addhyany12> yes goes in
[2023-01-03 14:41:40] <itsRamzilla> I mean there's power on it. You just don't see that very often.
[2023-01-03 14:41:40] <omar_u29v2> from that position you can consistently score if the shot is great
[2023-01-03 14:41:41] <ahsantariqmajeed> yes because of shot power is high
[2023-01-03 14:41:42] <dinzaa4> Mid vds better than prime but all keepers are kind of bad in this game
[2023-01-03 14:41:42] <%+JustKrepto> i'm saving that all day long
[2023-01-03 14:41:53] <%addhyany12> trivela, low driven both goes in also

[2023-01-03 14:43:30] <ahsantariqmajeed> shot power is high to catch the ball

[2023-01-03 14:43:51] <@%+georgesquirrell> Praying for a United loss tonight to make me feel better about Gers and Ipswich not winning yesterday
[2023-01-03 14:43:53] <@+Stingrayjnr> however I would move the keeper
