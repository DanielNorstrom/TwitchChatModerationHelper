[2022-12-07 00:09:48] <Astropigey> 1. Treat every weapon as if it were loaded, 2. Never point your weapon at anything you do not intend to shoot, 3. Keep your finger straight and off the trigger until you're ready to fire, 4. Keep your weapon on safe until you intend to fire, 5. know your target and what lies beyond and in between DONT FUCK IT UP and have fun
[2022-12-07 00:10:07] <%baz_exe> just shoot the gun till all the crud is gone ez pizi

[2022-12-07 00:16:32] <Blue_Cornflower> does running a rat tail file through the barrel change it enough to not match?
[2022-12-07 00:16:36] <Rainoor> the rifling degrades I mean
[2022-12-07 00:16:48] <Teacup4005> I still remember I had a 12gauge slug... it dissapeared years ago and am very sad
[2022-12-07 00:16:58] <@%ParanoidCorgi> it can.....
[2022-12-07 00:17:09] <%Rappolt> Also, that's mostly NCIS movie magic. Like the Batman scene where they recreate a fingerprint from a smushed slug
[2022-12-07 00:17:10] VIEWERS: 210
[2022-12-07 00:17:17] <$wikdipr> not that hard to melt steel, can be recycled into a nice paperweight, maybe with some additives to change the alloy mix
[2022-12-07 00:17:19] <Rainoor> If you're doing good shit, collect your brass in any case
[2022-12-07 00:17:25] <SylverWolfX> all that casing 'fingerprint' from this firing thing stuff is a myth from the 80's tbh, and so is the "national/manufacturer registry of test fired rounds"
[2022-12-07 00:17:31] <chuito12> They can probably say "enough of it matches and they changed the barrel" The rifling marks on the bullet obviously wont match tho

[2022-12-07 00:17:47] <%Rappolt> It really depends on rare the gun is. Any big name will be identical to nearly every other one sold in that area
[2022-12-07 00:17:51] <%spacepie9> I mean, you can get a whole glock slide and barrel for like $300.
[2022-12-07 00:17:54] <@%ParanoidCorgi> if you machine the barrel it would be hard to trace back, it'd the same got car parts
[2022-12-07 00:17:57] <Mantorok888> I mean you uhh can do things to  the inside of barrel anddd I'm gonna stop here.

[2022-12-07 01:03:36] <+OatmealMarble> there is an eyelet for patches
[2022-12-07 01:03:39] <reelmroomers> Airsoft would be fun, but the only place near me is CQC arena
[2022-12-07 01:03:40] <GarmrUSAF> @TSturtledove this is true
[2022-12-07 01:03:41] <+OatmealMarble> but you can just push patches on a brush too
[2022-12-07 01:03:45] <%Fis216> nah 80% of dudes in airsoft are larping 100%
[2022-12-07 01:03:46] <%KuroKamuy> LARPing is ok, makes you think about stuff you normally wouldn't
[2022-12-07 01:03:46] <Spookanide> my coworker is a reservist and he comes across airsoft bros sometimes and they can be full of themselves
[2022-12-07 01:04:06] <%$wikdipr> depends on the group

[2022-12-07 01:06:34] <+OatmealMarble> i only use boresnakes now, they're so much easier than the sectioned pole thing

[2022-12-07 01:07:48] <%VinegarRa> I use a jag when I can, but otherwise I pass the cloth in 1 direction and then the other direction
[2022-12-07 01:07:53] <TSturtledove> When cleaning hunting rifles in our house we have a brass jag that has a pointed tip.  The patches are stabbed on the tip and then pushed through from breach to muzzle, let the patch fall out the end of the barrel, pull rod back out gently and repeat.
[2022-12-07 01:08:16] <+OatmealMarble> it should freely twist already if you don't thread the sections 100% tight
[2022-12-07 01:08:28] <%VinegarRa> For a shotgun, you can just use a patch through a loop

[2022-12-07 01:10:29] <%VinegarRa> Ah, I use those first to help loosen whatever may be in there with some cleaner
[2022-12-07 01:10:42] <%VinegarRa> Those are the loops I am referring to

[2022-12-07 01:12:17] <%VinegarRa> So with those plastic loops, I personally thread some patches through it, apply some cleaner to the patches directly, and then wipe through it
[2022-12-07 01:12:19] <%VinegarRa> and then use a dry one
[2022-12-07 01:12:24] <%VinegarRa> and repeat with a wet and dry

[2022-12-07 01:13:31] <%rushtee_snacklefjord> Haven't ever felt to need to use a brush in the bore on a shotgun. Unless there is rust
[2022-12-07 01:13:34] <%VinegarRa> With just 2 shells through it, you probably don't need a brush. THen again, I wouldn't even bother to clean it, unless you were shooting corrosive shells through it, which at this point you'd be hard pressed to find shells like that
[2022-12-07 01:14:04] <%Rappolt> I'm fairly sure she said she is no longer in the Netherlands, partially to own guns. But htat was months ago

[2022-12-07 01:19:41] <%rushtee_snacklefjord> Auto is gonna = Full auto in most people minds
[2022-12-07 01:19:47] <%Rappolt> Automatic means bullets until mag empty when you pull once
[2022-12-07 01:19:49] <%KuroKamuy> they mean full auto
[2022-12-07 01:19:51] <GarmrUSAF> for pictols, automatic = self loading
[2022-12-07 01:19:52] <%spacepie9> I think it's technically correct, but most people assume 'full' auto if you don't specify semi.
[2022-12-07 01:19:56] <%hikimouto> @rushtee_snacklefjord blame video games for that
[2022-12-07 01:19:59] <+SecretAgentPickles> It does among people in the know
[2022-12-07 01:20:00] <DJ_Zephyr> I prefer to specify, or ppl think "machine pistol"
[2022-12-07 01:20:12] <+JoshuaFordEFT> in pistols its means semi to me, in rifles its a tossup to ke
[2022-12-07 01:20:21] <GarmrUSAF> automatic is self loading, full automatic is shoots till empty
[2022-12-07 01:20:25] <%L0WER1K> full auto is very rarely found, need licenses depending on where you are
[2022-12-07 01:20:27] <%+heftychonkster> In North American gun slang they normally mean semi
[2022-12-07 01:20:28] <if_you_seiso> automatic=automatic loader
[2022-12-07 01:20:42] <nartha1> I think autoloader is an older term because it contrasts with revolvers
[2022-12-07 01:20:47] <%rushtee_snacklefjord> You are correct, but are using more technical language than most
[2022-12-07 01:20:48] <+Ausl0ser> lol
[2022-12-07 01:20:52] <%KuroKamuy> lol true

[2022-12-07 01:21:14] <%spacepie9> I kinda doubt sleepy has a G18 or Beretta 93R lol
[2022-12-07 01:21:18] <%Rappolt> It's a little hazier in pistols, cause old term for "automatic" on pistols should be what we now call "auto-loader,"  which is mag fed and semi auto. Revolvers are still semi auto, but not auto loaders
[2022-12-07 01:21:22] <+SecretAgentPickles> He's an engineer,  he should be used to us coming up with terrible names for things Lol
[2022-12-07 01:21:28] <+JoshuaFordEFT> but a stiker is linear movement rather than rotational last i checked...
[2022-12-07 01:21:30] VIEWERS: 157
[2022-12-07 01:21:34] <%L0WER1K> auto typically means full auto, semi is used more commonly
[2022-12-07 01:21:35] <+lynema> oh lawd, he'd have an aneurysm if you brought up striker vs linear hammer
[2022-12-07 01:21:45] <%Rappolt> But even calling a revolver semi-auto is hazy
[2022-12-07 01:22:08] <GarmrUSAF> the game "The Way of the Hunter" might catch your interest, it's just hunting game
[2022-12-07 01:22:10] <%+NeoRussia> automatic was referred to the colt 1911 "automatic pistol" for automatic loading when compared to revolvers I believe
[2022-12-07 01:22:10] <if_you_seiso> it's common when you're reading pulps from the 30s and 40s
[2022-12-07 01:22:13] <%Rappolt> Internal vs external? Yeah, that's how I use it. I'm down to learn what's precise
[2022-12-07 01:22:24] <%+Peruzha> whenever I hear "automatic" I assume "automatically loading"
[2022-12-07 01:22:24] <%$wikdipr> people get butt hurt over semi vs fully automatic because the narrative tries to confuse the public

[2022-12-07 01:30:20] <Khoup1> Stripper clips, enbloc clips, clip magazines...

[2022-12-07 01:30:37] <DJ_Zephyr> Clipazine - piss everyone off at the same time
[2022-12-07 01:30:40] <%Reisen____> cuz clips are just stripper clips right?
[2022-12-07 01:30:42] <%SweetDreamii> I thought they were the same
[2022-12-07 01:30:44] <GarmrUSAF> as i was taught, a clip loads ammo into a magazine
[2022-12-07 01:30:49] <Fruitamongstmen> I mean clip or magazine, people will get the gist it.
[2022-12-07 01:30:58] <%rushtee_snacklefjord> If the bore is properly coated you can let it sit for a minute or 2
[2022-12-07 01:31:24] <james__jameson> sometimes clips are part of a magazine like in a Garand where the clips also act as the feed lips of the magazine
[2022-12-07 01:31:25] <+doku_the_cow> stripper clips and enbloc clips tend to be what people are refering to when people say clip as it is a specific thing
[2022-12-07 01:31:29] <%Rappolt> So what's the difference? I assume a clip is like stripper clips where the round is removed to load in, or like some guns where the whole thing goes in, but the rounds are only held at the read and are exposed
[2022-12-07 01:31:31] <%TheNotoriousOVB> yeah like the M1 Garand uses clips to load an internal magazine

[2022-12-07 01:32:18] <CirnoPower> @GarmrUSAF I mean in sturmgewehr it definitely means assault, not a bad weather. I don't know for sure whether assault rifle comes from sturmgewehr but I always believed it does
[2022-12-07 01:32:50] <%Rappolt> Oh, did it pop off inside?

[2022-12-07 01:33:32] <%rushtee_snacklefjord> The opposite issue is the rod sections fusing themselves together

[2022-12-07 01:33:40] <nartha1> storm can mean assault in english as well, hence "storming the castle" The words are cognate between the english and german
[2022-12-07 01:33:46] <%TheNotoriousOVB> does the shotgun go in two
[2022-12-07 01:34:10] <%TheNotoriousOVB> fair enough

[2022-12-07 01:34:30] <+doku_the_cow> that feels odd
[2022-12-07 01:34:51] <%Rappolt> If you mash the rod too hard, the little brass threads can smush or bend stuck. Or just snap skulle22Hehe Just start gentle and learn how mcuh force you can put in over a few rams
[2022-12-07 01:35:09] <%Rappolt> It's not that likely either way
