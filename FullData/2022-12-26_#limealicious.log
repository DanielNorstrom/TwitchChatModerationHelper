[2022-12-26 00:00:17] <Putnam3145> during testing i had a fort where they kept dancing so every time i passed by the tavern it started playing the tavern song. thankfully this isn't as much of a problem anymore

[2022-12-26 00:30:36] <%CptTeempo> CannibulCake rooPog
[2022-12-26 00:30:38] <AMERICA_YEA> from Toady one on this specific legless problem btw. "The current state now with fixes applied is that dwarves with one leg or a broken leg will use a crutch, and dwarves without legs or that can't use either leg but are otherwise treated and healthy will just move around slowly on the ground. There could be more for legless dwarves later, but it is out of bug territory now."

[2022-12-26 00:43:55] <AMERICA_YEA> it probably depends on the impact yield and impact fracture of each material the objects in the explosion are made of. so damage in a steam explosion should be dependent on material type then wether or not heat applied will melt/boil that object's material if I'm reading my notes right

[2022-12-26 01:14:01] <%FieldMedic4077> I think you'll need to put the hole in the ground first
[2022-12-26 01:14:03] <%+Jaithas> limesHi
[2022-12-26 01:14:04] <%guppian_dragon> make a single hole down
[2022-12-26 01:14:04] <Putnam3145> you build it above an already-tunneled thing with lava underneath
[2022-12-26 01:14:05] <Zero_skunk> open space first
[2022-12-26 01:14:10] <+Todini11> one of the edge-tiles underneath needs magma
[2022-12-26 01:14:11] <%AK_Zephyr> tunnel first, need a single lava tile that isn't the center one
[2022-12-26 01:14:15] <%MeleeTechie> @JakobiJobi limesHi We Dwarfin and fertin limesOwo

[2022-12-26 01:14:18] <%FieldMedic4077> yeah
[2022-12-26 01:14:18] <AMERICA_YEA> gotta have a hole down to the magma under it 1x1 in the center
[2022-12-26 01:14:18] <@%Kovubot> New video! It's time to show off her yoyo skills and die a whole bunch in Terraria ðŸª² https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkfCxbaxrv8
[2022-12-26 01:14:19] <Neph2019> one of the tiles under it (not the center) has to be lava
[2022-12-26 01:14:19] <%guppian_dragon> yes
[2022-12-26 01:14:19] <Granitier> @Limealicious I recomend looking at the wiki, but for each forge, there is a "spot" that the lava goes into, it also goes above the lava
[2022-12-26 01:14:20] <%AK_Zephyr> yup
[2022-12-26 01:14:22] <Putnam3145> yeah
[2022-12-26 01:14:24] <%kirby23590> the8bitCat Lava forge goes on top of a magma pool
[2022-12-26 01:14:33] <Putnam3145> @Granitier it can go under any of the tiles
[2022-12-26 01:14:45] <Neroxen_> the magma forge basically vacuums the lava up
[2022-12-26 01:14:46] <%earin_copper> Free fuel

[2022-12-26 01:14:50] <%FieldMedic4077> don't need fuel yeah
[2022-12-26 01:14:52] <Zero_skunk> yes, it needs no fuel

[2022-12-26 01:15:01] <%kirby23590> Magma forge has infinite fuel the8bitKazoo
[2022-12-26 01:15:03] <AMERICA_YEA> it's no fuel forge they're really good
[2022-12-26 01:15:05] <%bunglinglummox> It's best if you pick one of the impassable tiles, though. Just in case some dumb Urist decides to try and walk on the magma.
[2022-12-26 01:15:05] <%itsbeansoclock> limesDance
[2022-12-26 01:15:06] <%+Plasmier2K> uses no fuel, but some metals cannot be smelted in a magma forge
[2022-12-26 01:15:09] <%Spinel97> limesButt
[2022-12-26 01:15:09] <Granitier> @Granitier it can but only 2 tiles on the smith use the lava and the smelter uses only one spot, you can place it above the lava but for safety you only want to expose the input spots
[2022-12-26 01:15:11] <%AK_Zephyr> magma forge + magma smelter is great
[2022-12-26 01:15:31] <ArjunM> smelts with magma
[2022-12-26 01:15:32] <%AK_Zephyr> just like the forge
[2022-12-26 01:15:35] <+Jovial7> Does working with magma need to "get" you anything beyond the coolness of the motif of working with magma?
[2022-12-26 01:15:36] <Granitier> smelter is a smelter that uses lava
[2022-12-26 01:15:47] <%Caruso_45> forsenPls

[2022-12-26 01:16:14] <%earin_copper> In the ASCII version you could tell the magma channel was set up for the forge properly because it would light up red, hopefully the GUI version does something similar
[2022-12-26 01:16:14] <2wordname> looks like you're doing really well, my fort is only half this size
[2022-12-26 01:16:25] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> Limes will in fact flip all your levers
[2022-12-26 01:16:31] <%AK_Zephyr> both :)
[2022-12-26 01:16:39] <%FieldMedic4077> the forge uses the output of the smelter
[2022-12-26 01:16:40] <%AK_Zephyr> (they are both useful)
[2022-12-26 01:16:41] <%+JakobiJobi> limesDance i don't know
[2022-12-26 01:16:43] <Neroxen_> yes
[2022-12-26 01:16:46] <%JeffOverTime> Smelter then forge I think

[2022-12-26 01:26:36] <Putnam3145> obsidian is a black rock. very very black
[2022-12-26 01:26:37] <Granitier> @Limealicious I think its magma safe, also you can make a aztec sword out of it
[2022-12-26 01:26:42] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> It looks cool :) Also you can make a Macuahuitl
[2022-12-26 01:26:45] <+Kenokunai> For entering the nether :)

[2022-12-26 01:27:11] <Putnam3145> it's not very good, it's a very sharp sword but it's so brittle+weak that it doesn't actually work well as a sword compared to, say, bronze or iron
[2022-12-26 01:27:13] <%Rhinoceritis> Forgotten Beast-kun made me laugh so much
[2022-12-26 01:27:14] <%JoJo0217> Obsidian is a pretty good notes software :) I recommend it :)
[2022-12-26 01:27:15] <AMERICA_YEA> it's basically gem like it's got a low fracture point though so poor armor qualities at least
[2022-12-26 01:27:15] <%AK_Zephyr> you can make a sword that is ultra sharp (but pretty garbage overall)
[2022-12-26 01:27:15] <Granitier> @Limealicious well it isn't called a aztec sword but its bassicly what it is, a club with obsidion shards hammered into it making a makeshift blade
[2022-12-26 01:27:18] <DatCorvus> the swords made from it are worse than copper but you need wood to make them so theyre great for pissing off the elves

[2022-12-26 01:31:47] <Putnam3145> only way to build stairs up from below is to dig into a wall rather than using a floor

[2022-12-26 01:32:30] <lyscetiv> can you not build an up stair as a construction anymore?
