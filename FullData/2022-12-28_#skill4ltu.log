About that YT videos about cheating... my opinion is that riggin games does not affect directly my game and how good i am at the game... my satisfaction about this game is when i play smart and get a good time out of it, even if i win or lose...

[2022-12-28 12:41:56] <%lRONSlDE_> @skill4ltu even if they get 279e and chieff for free (paying for boosting) they can't buy the skill ... so even if they get OP tanks they dont know how to play with them... its sooo funny ! xDDD

[2022-12-28 12:43:09] <%+Azwing> @skill4ltu I don't think blaming players went over well either. It's a minority that buy boosts etc., so calling out the player base is off-base, in my opinion.

[2022-12-28 12:54:28] <Dr_Kry4n> @wurstmoped1904 unfortunatelly yes... Yesterday I was playing with 2 friends and we were playing with 3 renegades. we got a match against T7 tanks but the enemy team had a 3 man BZ platoon. We had no time to reach positions and they were farming the lower tier tanks like crazy. (it was here on cliff, they took the middle from the 1-2 line). There is literally nothing you can do about it other than camping. That's not an enjoyable experience

[2022-12-28 13:06:06] <%Ghostmook> @andreos83 If you plan to keep the tank it can be interessting to research all canon and try them all. But often you have a "big" gun with bigger alpha but less constant damage.

[2022-12-28 13:44:14] <%TheDrejc> @senkisem16 will try to play it with stabs hope it helps
[2022-12-28 13:44:19] <necromance> Skill based MM would fix the game.

[2022-12-28 13:44:26] <DifgyPro> @necromance nope
[2022-12-28 13:44:36] <Dr_Kry4n> @JamesJones155 but that's the thing, it's full random. It's a tank which requires very little skill, and does not reward great players with some outstanding matches. Because of the RNG the least skilled player can easily ruin someones game with the BZ simply because that crazy high alfa. And because of the bad accuracy better players have no "edge" over the rest of the player base, because it's full RNG if you hit anything or not....

[2022-12-28 13:44:47] <+wrenoc> skill based mm wouldnt even work. OW2 tried and ask anyone who plays that
[2022-12-28 13:44:51] <%matstos> skill based mm = smurfing which would make things even worse
[2022-12-28 13:44:53] <%caesarmorder> a bad idea

[2022-12-28 13:45:24] <maofoamvz> are you enjoying this tank? @skill4ltu
[2022-12-28 13:45:25] <+Chun_S> whats the current song
[2022-12-28 13:45:26] <RED_hellfire> i think skillbased MM will be good
[2022-12-28 13:45:29] <+durobaba> @skill4ltu skill may i ask which tank should we take from recruit friend complete rewards ?
[2022-12-28 13:45:33] <necromance> U miss the point, Im not talking about Rankeds. Im talking about "MMR" Same as League of Legends do.
[2022-12-28 13:45:41] <vintrage> bows to the king of bananas @skill4ltu
[2022-12-28 13:45:42] <Dr_Kry4n> @matstos but the tanks should be categorized... Like don't put an E100 against a Chieftain on a map which requires hulldown capability...
[2022-12-28 13:45:43] <IckyToad> @skill4ltu there is too many RNG elements for wot to work competetively

[2022-12-28 13:45:57] <@%Nyxphobia> @durobaba You can check !index and see which tanks are good or bad
[2022-12-28 13:46:03] <%ironmillos> i would love to see a match between univorn players
[2022-12-28 13:46:08] <+Lbrmcms> People actually wants not skill based but skill balanced matchmaking, like every team will have unicums avarage players and bad players equally
[2022-12-28 13:46:09] <LifeIsAGame000> In my opinion , +/- 1 mm is more than enough
[2022-12-28 13:46:10] <%Rankone1> No different than league of legends and they have x100 the player base
[2022-12-28 13:46:10] <+wrenoc> what if they assigned quality levels to different tanks and matched them with similar ones?
[2022-12-28 13:46:13] <krissz321> good day skill?
[2022-12-28 13:46:13] <totalwar1963> just play the game for fun if your always moaning about cheats or rigging in battle then dont play it
[2022-12-28 13:46:20] <+senkisem16> @thedrejc it surely does lmo skill gets load of equipment wrong on index using vents or aiming unit where it just does not make sense…also u can make the gun way better if u shoot full apcr….it makes 0 sense to shoot any ap on a tank like guard where the apcr is just better in every way

[2022-12-28 13:47:15] <just_likethat> @skill4ltu RNG is igredient that makes out blood hot and makes our heart pump faster
[2022-12-28 13:47:27] <%olddirtytshirt4> you know every single game is broken in one way or another? COD has some insane meta guns that you need to use otherwise you can suck a dick, fifa has meta cards and skill moves that you need to use and so on, my point is every single game has balancing issues in one way or another, unless you want to play something like train simulator in which case yes very balanced
[2022-12-28 13:47:31] <Naldric> for that WG would need to understand their own game...

[2022-12-28 13:49:39] <+m21elite> its not hard to move some high ranked players to the other team if the difference in average rating is too high from the 30 players picked for that match

[2022-12-28 13:49:50] <Dr_Kry4n> @senkisem16 I mean getting ammoracked almost never matters but when it happens you sucks big time :D The penetration drop off is also interesting on tanks which has bad premium ammo penetration. But the shell velocity compensates for this soo

[2022-12-28 13:50:05] <first_666> yep
[2022-12-28 13:50:05] <%Tankk1Poju> IMHO WoT could have some skill based MM, like not make 45% platoons  play against 60% platoons. Remove the extremes.
[2022-12-28 13:50:05] <+Lekar666tv> the only problem i see is that even the red players are doing superman things in the game out of any logic, which means even the rng of this tank is pumped
[2022-12-28 13:50:06] <zev319> imagine if they did skill based mm, 3 marking would be almost impossible? without the tourists to farm

[2022-12-28 13:50:49] <chieftain95> @skill4ltu  SKIIEELLL SORRY FOR BEING LATE!
[2022-12-28 13:50:50] <RED_hellfire> @skill would you play the same way if you knew all players in you and opposite team are unicums ?
[2022-12-28 13:50:57] <MrRey3> Guys drop it, you'll never hear a super unicum want a skill based MM. How would they farm tomatoes with it lol :D
[2022-12-28 13:50:59] <polik__xd> @zev319 it would be the same pretty much

[2022-12-28 13:52:06] <%kingofrome2> There a few of jealous players who try to kill you buy pushing you into the enemy just ignore them
[2022-12-28 13:52:06] <+senkisem16> @Dr_Kry4n the point is and im sure u can see that, is when u accidentaly miss a shot bcs ap is slow or u bounce off from somwehre where u shouldnt with ap is way more common than apcr fcking u up cause of normalization.....shooting apcr sometimes can be a disatvantage but its very small ammount of times compared to when its just straight up better
[2022-12-28 13:52:16] <+m21elite> when the matchmaker picks 30 players to be in a game it can just move players around to keep the average pr somewhat close

[2022-12-28 13:54:40] <dedarajko> Hey Skill, long one incoming. I saw your video for cheaters this morning. Here is something people don't understand about those 15-3 games. I had in my previous clan among some others, a guy who was always near the red line, didn't use repair kit and others, no premium ammo and refused to shoot a tank if it had less HP than his average damage. Now imagine having 5 guys like that in a team, plus RNG

[2022-12-28 13:55:19] <Dr_Kry4n> @senkisem16 you are absolutly right about this. By "spamming the full gold" you can have much more dmg and penetration and it's true for HEAT shells also (which is an even worse ammunition type). The biggest problem is the inconsistant things in the game. (in my opinion)
[2022-12-28 13:55:22] <mrc00lll> i have question do you get less on 5x experience if youy dont have prem ? i mean the 5x is from base right

[2022-12-28 14:00:07] <Dr_Kry4n> @senkisem16 I believe it's also not a great thing in the game. Most tanks have usable armor against normal shells, but can do nothing about premium ammunition. In one hand your penetrations will be more consistant, but your armor will be that much worse in the same time. I really don't know how could wargaming improve this (maybe give standard ammo some advatages).
[2022-12-28 14:00:08] <@%ItzAndreyZhak> @un1quexmerkz Yes, it's like a normal sub

[2022-12-28 14:05:15] <Dr_Kry4n> @senkisem16 because meta tanks are stupid powerful. WG balances them a way so everone has to shoot premium ammo if they want to penetrate. It is deliberate by WG because they want you to shoot more premium ammo so you will need premium account and premium tanks in order to farm enough credits. There is nothing bad with it, but it's getting stupid nowadays. It was annoying when they introduced the Japanese heavy line but that was the only line like that back then. Most tank has no  real weakpoint

[2022-12-28 14:09:26] <Dr_Kry4n> @alphabeerto it's not hidden, tanks are faster nowadays. Just think about it. A few years ago the IS-3 was the king of T8, becuase it had a top speed of 38 km/h. Most new heavy tanks have better armor and around 40 km/h top speed, some even more.

[2022-12-28 16:41:28] <%+Fherot> @vulkan_69 pretty much, weird they show is on one platform but not another. I would gamble that they’re similar enough to go by console

[2022-12-28 16:42:04] <vulkan_69> @Fherot probably because they had no choice, no ? and the sigma value, is it displayed on console ?

[2022-12-28 17:11:20] <+doarwin> @doarwin the arty only players wouldnt be the problem cause there aren't that many, but everyone is forced to do the missions with them if you want to complete them

[2022-12-28 17:13:00] <CaptainMoji> Hey @skill4ltu.. Merry Xmas... In my idea, when we say a game is good or bad, it depends on our idea of the game. Some, including QB, like a "counter strike" type WoT. I started the game because it was kinda realistic back in 2019-2020. Unfortunately, it lost that characteristic.
[2022-12-28 17:13:00] <%faustoraven> where did you guys see the board of players on santa helpers? coud you pass me the link?
