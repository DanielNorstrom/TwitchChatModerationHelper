[2022-12-31 11:34:42] <%KayBeeSC> L take fr fr
[2022-12-31 11:34:50] <%Avatar_EU> I heard your queue was MASSIVE break
[2022-12-31 11:35:00] <%LiamG> @geoff21 i think this is the last TSM stream?
[2022-12-31 11:35:10] <%kleier> S8n_501 he's played EFT since waaaay back, it's been frustrating being a long time player because some of the dev decisions have been mind-boggling
[2022-12-31 11:35:20] <%svekky> only scav queues tend to be bad right? but thats cause everyone scav into Streets
[2022-12-31 11:35:26] <%ManSolo> Tarkov's issues, for me at least, are queue times and the same quests every wipe
[2022-12-31 11:35:26] <%r31d4n> he's spoiled from cycle, marauders, dark and darker, where you get in a game instantly
[2022-12-31 11:35:29] <%kleier> game's become less tactical and more run and gunny which doesn't suit his style as much
[2022-12-31 11:35:54] <%kleier> dark and darker queues were so good, literally 10 seconds and the lobby was full and game popping
[2022-12-31 11:36:18] <%+Zuqar> i didn't mind dark and darker but its really slow paced imo
[2022-12-31 11:36:22] <%+Tawnik> @break loves marauders... let me tell you lol
[2022-12-31 11:36:23] <%kleier> since he started playing, i mean
[2022-12-31 11:36:24] <S8n_501> @kleier actually just last night spoke with a friend about how would a tarkov-like game be with 3-5x larger maps and more survival/pve aspects.
[2022-12-31 11:36:25] <%k3ny0n> I ordered a steamdeck last night brkBlebleble
[2022-12-31 11:36:28] <%kleier> he started in like 2016
[2022-12-31 11:36:33] VIEWERS: 314
[2022-12-31 11:36:36] <%Smorty_1> Shouldn't be much queuing in marauders since nobody plays it
[2022-12-31 11:36:44] <%LiamG> hastig played tarkov for like 3 hours last night.

[2022-12-31 11:36:45] <%kleier> yeah changing meta is also a big factor
[2022-12-31 11:36:46] <%LiamG> i think he;;s back
[2022-12-31 11:36:53] <%schikocko> I dont like some of the EFT changes, like the whole in the wall... why fuck over the casual even more....
[2022-12-31 11:37:29] <%kleier> i stand by my words though, still way more peepoRun and PepegaGun than it was 4 years ago
[2022-12-31 11:37:36] <%Jaahan> @BreaK I'm a slow typer. All the best to you too, and your carer and the crab brkHeart
[2022-12-31 11:37:39] <S8n_501> I STILL don't understand shooting an M4 and the guns jumps into the air like crazy, lmao >"BALANCE"<
[2022-12-31 11:37:43] <%k3ny0n> I can’t wait 1-2 week delivery though
[2022-12-31 11:38:04] <%kleier> bit of both imo FrogeNeat but we can agree to disagree on that
[2022-12-31 11:38:11] <%+skanzz> The run and gun is partly economics. Better to survive 60% of 10 min raids than 80% of 30 minute raids from a progression perspective
[2022-12-31 11:38:17] <%LiamG> Yes logitech
[2022-12-31 11:38:17] <%$geoff21> I prefer watching this game than playing it tbh
[2022-12-31 11:38:26] <%+Zuqar> you have a mouse by the way :)

[2022-12-31 11:45:39] <%aspzan> like for subathons?

[2022-12-31 11:46:04] <Sir_Oranje> Only if theyre nekkid and sleep without covers tbh
[2022-12-31 11:46:06] <@%sRede> twitch offered something similar to ad incentive, but hours streamed, so people did subathons, which scuffed their stats, now they are getting these stupid offers because it's based on the previous months KEKL

[2022-12-31 11:46:17] <%$BazHicks> it's the equivalent to going to work and getting to paid to sleep in a corner

[2022-12-31 14:15:49] <%SingularFish> So it might be harsh but my solution is, if you report someone for cheating, that account should get insta-banned and then someone should review it and decide to un-ban. That would stop people from cheating since 1 report would cut them off of the game for a few days. Yeah it'll hurt the legit players and it'll get abused at first and then would die down.

[2022-12-31 16:04:45] <%Kezzran> You have to be intentional about finding time together after having children @BreaK . It gets easier as they get older as well.
[2022-12-31 16:04:54] <%+Docdude83> It has been 11 years since my first and we still struggle with time just us
[2022-12-31 16:04:56] <%LiamG> @Mark_rogers i was gunna make a horrible joke here... but i refrained

[2022-12-31 16:47:11] <%ManSolo> @cheeseandbunionthe4th ok so you agree the royal family titles are arbitrary and meaningless. If she really wanted to be a princess then why didn't she ask Harry to do the same for here
[2022-12-31 16:47:14] <%cheeseandbunionthe4th> @Kezzran no she was appointed it, you dont just marry a prince and become a princess it doesnt work like that, only auto princess is born to a king
