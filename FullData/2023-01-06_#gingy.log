[2023-01-06 02:00:18] <%+xExams> @Gingy I think collector should be unlocked right away but locked behind level and tasks so you can turn in all kappa items as you go
[2023-01-06 02:00:19] <damooseninja> you have to 100% or no go
[2023-01-06 02:00:19] <@%+jimmiedrum> last one I had was at 80 and didn't get it
[2023-01-06 02:00:20] <+im_tha_duck> im at 80%
[2023-01-06 02:00:20] <justthatguykit> you have to fully get the time

[2023-01-06 18:06:51] <%gc_monster7> Isn’t Bunker pt 2 just all doors searching?
[2023-01-06 18:06:59] <kaliscan> the one where you touch all the bunker doors in reserve yeah

[2023-01-06 18:07:54] <@%+2L33Zy> @gc_monster7 I think he was talking about d2?

[2023-01-06 18:47:22] <%CaerusBlue> a big hope for me in the future is your character "falling down" and having to do an animation to get up when you jump leg damage
[2023-01-06 18:47:30] <Lil_Spitty> to bait probably
[2023-01-06 18:47:31] <macdadidagod> What's a cheap sniper that I can buy at level 5
[2023-01-06 18:47:37] <%Scooter7> @JCTAGGER ahhhhh ok I was not sure why I kept losing rep when they were shooting at me......but I have to let them hit me first I see
[2023-01-06 18:47:40] <+timberstiffy> YA. the sledge is there every raid.
[2023-01-06 18:47:50] <zTreino_xD> if you jump and mid air prone should you make all red but no legs breaks
[2023-01-06 18:47:53] <%gc_monster7> @caerusblue that’s gonna be a little too much for a game

[2023-01-06 19:19:10] <+CaptainSask> I started with the regular edition, then every wipe I go up a level, I'm at EOD now. Definitely easier with the bigger stash and the large secure case.

[2023-01-06 23:22:17] <+ScarlettAveryy> @eminemity If it happens after a few raids id recommend regular restarts, if its from first raid then im not 100% sure, performance this wipe took a major hit

[2023-01-06 23:22:45] <+eminemity> @XxKatanaUWUxX That's what I'm sayin. The other day, I cancelled 2x after 15 of waiting both times
[2023-01-06 23:23:00] <%XxKatanaUWUxX> @satolbogt oh, didn’t know. Thank you if it works
[2023-01-06 23:23:05] <+Lancestrike> SLEDGE!
[2023-01-06 23:23:27] <+AonAn4m> is this scav or pmc?
[2023-01-06 23:23:30] <%XxKatanaUWUxX> I’m just move over to Asia server <1 min queue time but 100 ms
[2023-01-06 23:23:40] <TheLegendBruh> tarkov drops are frustrating. they run them for 12 hours with 6 drops  that you need to watch 2 hours each for. and then the drops give you nothing
[2023-01-06 23:23:43] <+AonAn4m> gun makes me think pmc but scavs are friendly so confusion
[2023-01-06 23:23:44] <+eminemity> @SatolboGT does that actually work?
[2023-01-06 23:23:56] <bling1016gaming> @eminemity You gotta hold out longer. I've been getting into raids with 40+ minutes left after a ~20 minute match timer
[2023-01-06 23:24:17] <emergemc_twitch> you  can mess about with the control panel settings for nivida and get some more fps just search it up on google
[2023-01-06 23:24:18] <+eminemity> @AonAn4m those are player scavs i think
[2023-01-06 23:24:29] <misomisoxd> arent the rogues super tuned up this wipe LOL

[2023-01-06 23:24:44] <bringthenoiz_> Are they better than Scavs at shooting?
[2023-01-06 23:24:47] <SatolboGT> @eminemity it has for me.. 1 to 2 minute load times
[2023-01-06 23:24:49] <+eminemity> @bling1016gaming at that point, i don't even wanna do a scav, I'd rather just pistol run and loot ina  2 min pmc Q
[2023-01-06 23:24:57] <%+LtDanJR89> charge head first and take them all out
[2023-01-06 23:25:01] <+eminemity> @AonAn4m apparently i guess

[2023-01-06 23:26:08] <bringthenoiz_> They don't miss a shot, right?
