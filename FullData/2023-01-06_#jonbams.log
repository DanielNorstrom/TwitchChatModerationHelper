[2023-01-06 18:29:29] <%ktorn_> I buy NFTs, not as an investment, but just as a way to reward artists for art that I like. I normally chose artists from the global south, because what for me is a lunch worth of crypto, for them it can feed them for a week. Sometimes I get offers for some of the artwork that I could turn into a profit, but I don't really do it for profit  Cheer100 Cheer100

[2023-01-06 18:30:21] <+sanchez_kid18> i work for a small NFT project actually, mostly bullish for gaming and everyday use cases tbh, I think the "NFT" aspect side of it will be there, its more like a community aspect i think. but like i said i think the big playing field will be on Blockchain gaming and everyday use cases. Also like dono said its a BIG way of helping out independent and small artist

Also like dono said its a BIG way of helping out independent and small artist

[2023-01-06 19:16:30] <%ktorn_> The potatoes used to make McDonald's fries are grown specifically for the company and are specially chosen for their size, shape, and flavor.  Once the potatoes are harvested, they are washed and cut into the shape of fries at a processing facility. The fries are then par-fried, which involves partially cooking them in oil to give them a crispy exterior. They are then frozen and shipped to McDonald's restaurants, where they are fully cooked in vegetable oil to order. #ChatGPT
