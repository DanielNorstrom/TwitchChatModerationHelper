[2022-12-17 08:55:30] <%GammaChris> I always just keep it on 'Retro' I don't even think about it
[2022-12-17 08:55:32] <Altazimuth> I don't stream much but I've usually been a specific-game guy on the times I've streamed.
[2022-12-17 08:55:33] <ranranrun> i set it to the game unless its super obscure
[2022-12-17 08:55:39] <@%IlyaYenotka> I put it to the game because I want to see the WR holder come and backseat me.
[2022-12-17 08:55:55] <i_am_jessa> Depends on how known the game is I think.
[2022-12-17 08:55:58] <Altazimuth> I like accuracy. It makes things easier to understand in the UI for me.
[2022-12-17 08:56:07] <ranranrun> yeah imo it just depends on the game
[2022-12-17 08:56:19] <%SnackoRacko> Mostly retro unless it has a huge audience. But most categories like mario 64 they get mad if your not speed running.

[2022-12-17 08:57:01] <Altazimuth> Otherwise in my followed channels I see somebody streaming "Retro" and their stream title is just like "Friday, Let's Go! Blorplelads" and I have no idea what game they're playing unless I click through.

[2022-12-17 09:00:35] <%Inkunaa> is that because games currently being updated can't count?

[2022-12-17 10:45:21] <socialistOtter> I think there were underwhelming zeldas but mostly I think they were good
[2022-12-17 10:45:22] <azuredamascus> link to the past
[2022-12-17 10:45:23] <MeadowAtLast> really fun
[2022-12-17 10:45:27] <DunderJones> i think the 2d games are super comfy
[2022-12-17 10:45:33] <socialistOtter> like I liked the train one even
[2022-12-17 10:45:41] <twilightcor> i played windwaker when i was younger but thats the only one i have any experience with
[2022-12-17 10:45:44] <%+mobile_suit_grundle> I've only beaten a few of the 2D ones
[2022-12-17 10:45:52] <nathynek0> i too hide my chests behind the death of a large undead hand.
[2022-12-17 10:45:54] <@%KafroHudrep> @socialistOtter i also liked it but that is an objectively bad opinion that i will hold
[2022-12-17 10:45:56] <DunderJones> maybe just a little
[2022-12-17 10:46:04] <+Keylel> bro goty i swear to god broski
