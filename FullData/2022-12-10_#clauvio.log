[2022-12-10 09:56:14] <%$MautheDoog> ocarina is a very melancholic game
[2022-12-10 09:56:58] <FraunchToost> cheshi59Wave how goes the zelders, gamer?
[2022-12-10 09:57:02] <JulianoUchoa> You have to get the Mask of Truth for see what that Stones have to say
[2022-12-10 09:57:02] <@%KafroHudrep> im the majorpo's borpo liker
[2022-12-10 09:57:05] <%manEmajor15> I think it depends on the person
[2022-12-10 09:57:07] <%$MautheDoog> probably, botw is huge
[2022-12-10 09:57:11] <%MrFoois> ocarina is more popular and generally liked but majora has more dedicated fans i think
[2022-12-10 09:57:14] <mlemly> majoras mask is my fav but i guess its bsically tied with oot
[2022-12-10 09:57:18] <mlemly> both great games hehe
[2022-12-10 09:57:18] <@%KafroHudrep> i mean "popular" yes but there's a lot of hate around botw too
[2022-12-10 09:57:23] <JulianoUchoa> They give you tips, some are useful some are not
[2022-12-10 09:57:35] VIEWERS: 231
[2022-12-10 09:57:38] <%manEmajor15> People play BOTW without playing any other zelda so I'd assume it's the largest
[2022-12-10 09:58:02] <%+Grimpond> MM has my fav vibes
[2022-12-10 09:58:11] <papercompass> Everyone has their own idea of what the ideal Zelda game is.
[2022-12-10 09:58:35] <JulianoUchoa> What name you gave to the boy ?
[2022-12-10 09:58:36] <%rotarybubbles> I get too attached to my weapons to play botw
[2022-12-10 09:58:56] <JulianoUchoa> Mine was Linkardo
[2022-12-10 09:59:19] <%manEmajor15> Yeah that annoys me in botw honestly
[2022-12-10 09:59:27] <%denchi__> that seems to be the one big issue a lot of people have with it

[2022-12-10 09:59:51] <%$MautheDoog> botw had fantastic promise but was very flawed and very unfinished
[2022-12-10 09:59:51] <%manEmajor15> The weapon switching kind of breaks the flow as well
[2022-12-10 09:59:55] <%MrFoois> same, i love collecting unique weapons but not if they break
[2022-12-10 09:59:56] <%$MautheDoog> genuinely worried about botw2
[2022-12-10 09:59:57] <rakijah> I think theres a mod that removes durability if you play on emulator iirc. But of course the games not designed around that.

[2022-12-10 10:00:01] <Tursmo> I really liked BotW. I just hope the next one fixes the weapons, more/better dungeons and more classic zelda songs and I'm happy
[2022-12-10 10:00:15] <JulianoUchoa> You have to get a special mask too see what that weird stones have to say. They give you tips, some are useful some are not

[2022-12-10 10:00:40] <%SkyeSora> @rotarybubbles i got master sword as fast as possible hoping at least that would let me ignore that, but it really upset me that even master sword broke
[2022-12-10 10:00:44] <+starchyfriend> the thing that disappointed me most about BotW was the lack of variety in enemies
[2022-12-10 10:00:53] <%manEmajor15> oh wait this is THAT owl
[2022-12-10 10:00:54] <nily_is_nily> *three readings later* i have no idea what this owl said

[2022-12-10 10:02:13] <%AlphaOmega82> the power of childhood friendship...
[2022-12-10 10:02:28] <%SkyeSora> i dont super mind durability nechanics, but is should be able to repair it and shouldnt have to go through 5 weapons in one fight
[2022-12-10 10:02:34] <@%KafroHudrep> I don't think you're Sari-at all actually
[2022-12-10 10:02:37] <%$MautheDoog> @SkyeSora it can't really, but when it loses durability it needs to recharge
[2022-12-10 10:02:38] <+starchyfriend> @SkyeSora yeah, it has a "cooldown" if you use it enough
[2022-12-10 10:02:53] <%godot_was_here> the dopamine sounds
[2022-12-10 10:02:55] <%godot_was_here> addiction
[2022-12-10 10:03:07] <FraunchToost> it's not my favorite Zelda, but the sounds and music are iconic for sure
