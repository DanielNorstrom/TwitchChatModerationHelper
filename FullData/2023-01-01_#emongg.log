[2023-01-01 00:06:51] <honeybearies> @ItsJonpaul i think its cause the healers have other teammates to heal or dmgboost too
[2023-01-01 00:06:52] <Cissco> I wonder if Doom block doesn't actually reduce damage from Ramattra punches since it pierces shields
[2023-01-01 00:06:53] <+dookieshoes93> They should rework Ana as a dps for next season
[2023-01-01 00:06:54] <natenigh> Every time I have to go up against an Orisa I just go Bastion. Bait out one of her cool downs and then go turret mode. Goes long enough you just end up frying her lol

[2023-01-01 01:22:27] <%+omnideoist> that sojourn just slid out super fast, that's weird.
[2023-01-01 01:22:30] <jackstoningt0n> I dont get why the guy who can control gravity throws a rock instead of yanking flying heroes out of the air
[2023-01-01 01:22:35] <%$ThisIsCrabTV> @SpookyAzul So it will be today?
[2023-01-01 01:22:39] <%+omnideoist> ... that was interesting visor

[2023-01-01 01:23:19] <AlienJoe> @jackstoningt0n Accretion is a thing that happens with planetary bodies so it does fit his theme
[2023-01-01 01:23:22] <PeaceBrigade> I'm always afraid to play comp because somehow people are even worse in low level comp than quickplay. Like... silver and gold I've maybe had 1 person in comms ever, and the second something goes wrong people leave. Then I lose rating and just don't queue
[2023-01-01 01:23:30] <PeaceBrigade> Is it better to literally just bang head against wall and keep trying?
[2023-01-01 01:23:31] <derzky_huerzky> rreally this ends now

[2023-01-01 01:23:44] <ThePerplexedOne> @Emongg They nerf Sojourn but it's never enough. What should they do?
[2023-01-01 01:23:47] <%$ThisIsCrabTV> @PeaceBrigade I actually have the exact opposite experience
[2023-01-01 01:24:04] <PeaceBrigade> Are you as low rated as me? lol
[2023-01-01 01:24:07] <!%Vent_YeahManThatsCool> emongg, you just said sojourn was the best dps , but you had mercy in S-tier, so your tier list automatically doesn't count 💀
[2023-01-01 01:24:12] <noir> @PeaceBrigade probably good to q with others
[2023-01-01 01:24:15] <%stephstephy> so close
[2023-01-01 01:24:19] <noir> or just focus on what you can improve yourself
[2023-01-01 01:24:22] <+Jjman93> @PeaceBrigade high silver low gold feels real bad
[2023-01-01 01:24:24] <PeaceBrigade> @noir People have friends?! :P
[2023-01-01 01:24:26] <%$ThisIsCrabTV> @PeaceBrigade I played on the 1v5 againt Bronzes before YEP (Silver on Support rn)

[2023-01-01 01:24:51] <+Bull3tR1d3> @PeaceBrigade it's better to focus on yourself and find out what you can do better to win games. There's always gonna be the 25/25/50 rule. where 25% of the games you will win no matter what and 25% you will lose no matter what and then the other 50% is games you could have controlled
[2023-01-01 01:25:00] <calicky99> dude now that im in diamond everyone plays well
[2023-01-01 01:25:06] <just_gomi> is there a range limit on jav
[2023-01-01 01:25:08] <PeaceBrigade> I also flex, I wonder if I should just pick a single role and just queue for nothing but that. I just don't know which role to focus on if that's the case
[2023-01-01 01:25:28] <+pedrolar27> 99% for the drop
[2023-01-01 01:25:29] <noir> flex will make you better at the game i think

[2023-01-01 01:44:56] <%+omnideoist> @omnideoist you don't play WITH them, but you do play around them. if they're pushing in, it's a good time to flank and try to get a kill. also playing with your team can be very good as tracer too. like if they have a tracer or genji going for your supports, you can play with them and protect them

[2023-01-01 01:54:18] <midaa4> @tormsay happy new year. i wanna make you even happier…
[2023-01-01 01:54:20] <!%Vent_YeahManThatsCool> I understand what you're saying, sort of, the MMR vs cosmetic rank is generally the main point of contention and confusion
[2023-01-01 01:54:21] <BengalsFan4Lyf> ranked just needs to go back to SR. Reinforce & JAWS said it best if they lower it to 5 people will say well why not 3 wins then. Just go back to SR
[2023-01-01 01:54:28] <%+rukie123> i got a 70% winrate on reaper and 67% on ashe. i wanna start ranked. should i just spam them cuz im confident or should i adjust to the teams and swap?

[2023-01-01 01:54:49] <%stephstephy> as someone who gets anxious for comp, I'd love to see the MMR for QP

[2023-01-01 01:54:56] <%+omnideoist> @eternitys_edge if it took that long to get out of bronze and you're getting burnt out, it doesn't hurt to take a break. or you could try a different role for a bit since it wouldn't derank your DPS (assuming that's the one you're Silver 1 in)
[2023-01-01 01:54:59] <%+zelorus_1> @catsmint I feel that, this system just sucks, or on console I'm plt, faces diamond and masters callengers, win Games there and still keep plat 2 xD, 2 times in a row
[2023-01-01 01:55:01] <Kablard> Happy New Year from Finland!
[2023-01-01 01:55:04] <basedoates> 6 wins before 10 loses then best of 3 for rank up

[2023-01-01 01:56:50] <Atumis_Nox> I'd say if they want to keep it wins, then do like every 5. Or do like every 10 games no matter the outcome

[2023-01-01 02:16:34] <%+Frankenfunk> My favorite character is the reaper guy. he is very powerfull. special move, honestly is one of the best in the game and so he comes equipped with these two revolvers and only takes about 3 or 4 shots to actually execute a kill so it comes really in handy specially when you come from the side.
