[2022-12-20 17:55:54] <%sofishdekat> is it weird that I don't really have an interest in going to hawaii?
[2022-12-20 17:56:47] <%sofishdekat> If I'm gonna spend that much $ on a tropical island vacay I'd rather go to an all-inclusive place in the bahamas or in the south pacific
[2022-12-20 17:59:54] <%RoadRunner27> I'd go to hawaii just to see it once, but for a tropical destination I much prefer the USVI

Yeah i got robbed while at the vape shop the other day and the owner tried to tell me I couldn’t go home because i was scared and alone and so i told him im locking up shop n will give my keys to someone else a different day n walked out mid shift. So i get to recover from that for the rest of the month

[2022-12-20 18:20:57] <KoolyRabbitGaming> Yeah I use to work at a company that specialize in that. Yes you have to recalibrate it if you have those assists on your car. And you need room to do it. That is true.

[2022-12-20 18:22:37] <%RadiantPhoenix_> they can be, a lot of them can be done on the road, but it sounds like you need a static recalibration
[2022-12-20 18:22:38] <+trmoore4321> Can you not just get it replaced then go get it recalibrated?

[2022-12-20 18:23:53] <KoolyRabbitGaming> If you get the windshield replace and you do not recalibrated, you gonna get warning systems on y our dashboard. Pretty much gonna look like a Christmas tree on your dash and those won't work

[2022-12-20 18:24:00] <raz_in_chains> yeah but the lane and brake assistance might malfunction while going down the road, adn lock up your brakes on the highway or something
[2022-12-20 18:24:01] <%RadiantPhoenix_> I'm replacing a windshield on a jeep right now lol
[2022-12-20 18:24:02] <+holyburnz> If something in the car needs to be calibrated, usually it's not safe to drive it if it's not calibrated. Especially in a feature that controls breaks like you described. Cuz if it's not calibrated, it might think you're about to hit something and hit your break without you knowing
[2022-12-20 18:24:02] <+notG10> our* auto correct. and no flu ;)

[2022-12-20 18:37:15] <+Anym> @wolff213 So, Apex got Heirloom skins. Which are like special melee skins per legend. BUT, when such a skin comes out, it's tied to a "collection" event where you gotta get EVERY. SINGLE. ITEM. before getting the Heirloom. That's $140 total
[2022-12-20 18:37:19] <+Its_Crispy24> @ndogt Better than $20 tho (I still didn't buy them)

[2022-12-20 20:34:44] <FlareToga> Meaning so someone can be Gold or Silver, but have a negative MMR?

[2022-12-20 20:34:57] <AE2UX> what's the point of playing ranked when quickplay and ranked is the same?
[2022-12-20 20:35:03] <+Kuraned> Why in the hells do they have skill tiers and divisions then? Just put out the number and go off that
[2022-12-20 20:35:10] <%$jasonwocky> this is a completely normal ranking system people just don't get it
[2022-12-20 20:35:10] <+clutcharama> shifts in the bell curve probably represent changes between highly sought-after ranks, where it becomes more competative
[2022-12-20 20:35:11] <%+emilionario_> @FlareToga i don't think its negative mmr but its more like who get paired with

[2022-12-20 20:35:36] <thebiggestblac> why is your rank not the one that's shown to you? whats the point
[2022-12-20 20:35:37] <xtjs2018x> This is hardly an explanation as to why I queue with masters when I'm a gold player and proceed to get trashed each time

[2022-12-20 20:41:42] <%jonah_ward> its time they let us see rank again.
[2022-12-20 20:41:42] <howslifebrah> Doesn't all this just say that there's literally no difference in competitiveness between qp and rank? MMR applies to all modes and the rank we can see is meaningless

[2022-12-20 20:42:06] <FlareToga> We should just get #FlatsForBlizzard trending because Flats knows 200 times more than most people can comprehend
[2022-12-20 20:42:06] <+GlocktopusG> If only we could see our ranks in game

[2022-12-20 20:42:13] <+AmNotLucy> @jasonwocky this is what they added in ow2 when it released
[2022-12-20 20:42:16] <jennpenn10> I wanna play with and against some GMs just to see what it feels like. I already do it a lil in scrims but our ranks are very varied.
[2022-12-20 20:42:16] <@%chompchomp8> The FTUES were too bad for silver so they got bronze 5 PepeLaugh
[2022-12-20 20:42:25] <%$jasonwocky> @GlocktopusG then people would stop playing because most of them would never climb

[2022-12-20 20:44:39] VIEWERS: 3 853
[2022-12-20 20:44:40] <%jonah_ward> makes sense, even if you are bronze if you are a vet you still have more knowledge of the game
[2022-12-20 20:44:41] <%gappyspins> TROOO
[2022-12-20 20:44:42] <djzander_> unless like they’re cracked with aim and positioning
[2022-12-20 20:44:42] <howslifebrah> This explains why almost all unranked to GM's haven't broken higher than plat 3 with 7-0 placements. You just start low
[2022-12-20 20:44:47] <hornmel> and then they jump into comp and take me down with them
[2022-12-20 20:44:49] <HellCastleBTW> data yummy
[2022-12-20 20:45:02] <%gappyspins> This post has me trooing here and there
[2022-12-20 20:45:04] <%digitalhadoken1> there is no fair for new people
[2022-12-20 20:45:07] <nejack11> @drkmajik77 probably because your mmr was still on your rank
[2022-12-20 20:45:07] <@%chompchomp8> @Blizz_Craig Can you give any insight into why the MMR distribution curve has a drop at 0 and small peaks at +-3? Otheriwise the curve is pretty much Gaussian

[2022-12-20 20:45:55] <!%Blizz_Craig> @chompchomp8 Just how the graph was captured at the time they pulled this data, its always in flux
[2022-12-20 20:45:58] <%$TeaHauss> @burtmacklin58 you want new players to get stomped and quit the game?
[2022-12-20 20:46:06] <%swolofraggins> I hit masters in tank with 21 wins, and I just get rolled now

[2022-12-20 20:46:15] <Gaiia_x> my shop still has not changed tf?
[2022-12-20 20:46:18] <%$jasonwocky> all of this seems like stuff we already knew / guessed, aside from maybe they're gonna try and match MMRs within roles now
[2022-12-20 20:46:23] <%+emilionario_> what is a new player? a player that just made an account? or a player that hasn't had an account for a min?
[2022-12-20 20:46:23] <OptimusChristt> lmfao I had a 5 game win streak and went from B5 to a whopping B4
[2022-12-20 20:46:27] <%+ZectorV1> as soon as season 2 started it booted me down a full rank from my old STARTING POINT despite me climbing up two full rank divisions over the start of season 1. That shit feels like ASS
[2022-12-20 20:46:27] <%+JonTurn> @burtmacklin58 i dont think thats fair to say. Its more like they want people to at minimum get a 50/50 winrate so their experience isnt horrible all the time
[2022-12-20 20:46:28] <%+TrollALong> matchmaker was pretty fair. I had my account boosted to diamond twice and both times within 2 seasons I would be back in gold
[2022-12-20 20:46:32] <%$TeaHauss> NOTED selfish players
[2022-12-20 20:46:32] <SleepyDuckE> yeah this still sounds like a lot of bullshit from a dev team that has no idea what their even doing
[2022-12-20 20:46:34] <Rasgore> do they still not account individual performance into mmr???
[2022-12-20 20:46:34] <Gaiia_x> ive restarted and restarted battle net??

[2022-12-20 20:46:45] <%+Lovelygong> I do feel like this season a lot more of my games have been decent and close games.
[2022-12-20 20:46:55] <jeremy_council> new player experience still sucks
[2022-12-20 20:46:59] <djzander_> i like they shared this data
[2022-12-20 20:47:00] <martiannttv> I’m at work I’m gonna have to come back and watch this where is this info?
[2022-12-20 20:47:00] <%+Lovelygong> Season 1 it was hard win or hard loss a lot more often.
[2022-12-20 20:47:01] <%da_borg> @Rasgore  personal performance is what they base mmr off
[2022-12-20 20:47:07] <burtmacklin58> that mentality auto-establishes that 80% of matches will be steamrolls and not balanced
[2022-12-20 20:47:09] <rphii> then just show us the MMR ??? blizzard, hello ?
[2022-12-20 20:47:10] <%BigBoyBooling> so mmr is the only thing that matters word
[2022-12-20 20:47:24] <%Deadtift> @chompchomp8 sorry to bother you, eu player here. In my shop bast skin is sold in bundle with a candy cane charm. Does US shop have the same bundle? (I don't know if shop is the same worldwide or localized)
[2022-12-20 20:47:24] <+gru682> Is this why when I queue with my friend who played overwatch 1 we get absolutely rolled?
[2022-12-20 20:47:25] <+ikelos101> @Rasgore apparently not, it just sucks that im not climbing because i lose even tho i keep top fragging every single game
[2022-12-20 20:47:26] <dalcots69> Corpa fun doesn't make money

[2022-12-20 20:47:26] <%+TheEmptySkys1> Cheer500 So, if I'm understanding current matchmaking right. Because they only look at MMR, I could be a lower rank than someone worse than me because in order to climb, regardless of my shown rank, I'm playing against better players who's MMR is equivalent to mine
[2022-12-20 20:47:27] <@%^StreamElements> TheEmptySkys1 just cheered 500 bits flatsH

[2022-12-20 20:47:30] <%$jasonwocky> @rphii they won't do that because it hardly ever changes, which is discouraging to players

[2022-12-20 20:47:32] <BiiNK1E_> Why not show us our MMR then ?
[2022-12-20 20:47:36] <@%chompchomp8> @Deadtift yes its the same
[2022-12-20 20:47:37] <nejack11> ranks are just cosmetic
[2022-12-20 20:47:45] <+t3ntaquil> @gru682 yep
[2022-12-20 20:47:49] <%da_borg> @ikelos101  BRO IT LITERALLY GIVES YOU YOUR MMR OFF YOUR PERFORMANCE
[2022-12-20 20:47:49] <+probablycoal> that system makes no sense tho
[2022-12-20 20:47:52] <%$jasonwocky> @nejack11 exactly
[2022-12-20 20:47:54] <mk_skinny> it should just put you back to the 5 of whatever division ur in
[2022-12-20 20:47:56] <%x_Kings_x> it makes me not want to grind if the rank means nothing, thats the point of comp is the rank

[2022-12-20 20:48:12] <%ST0NEDow> nah
[2022-12-20 20:48:14] <%+JonTurn> @Flats  the biggest issue i see right now is the new players queue theyre making. If they are not careful its possible they have a shadow ladder with new players queueing up the ladder playing a totally different meta with a different understanding of the game
[2022-12-20 20:48:17] <OptimusChristt> You mean having the game make you feel shitty about your gameplay is a bad thing?
[2022-12-20 20:48:17] <howslifebrah> Well, this confirms a lot, but it also confirms no one below T500 or the bottom of bronze has any idea what their actual skill is compared to the playerbase cuz rank is meaningless

[2022-12-20 20:48:39] <FlareToga> so if you're gm, the only difference  between you and a silver player with the same mmr, is the gm getting a player title at the end of the season. cottontailWIDE

[2022-12-20 20:50:58] <Wonder_fulll> is the bastion skin in the shop rn normally 1 coin?
[2022-12-20 20:51:00] <!%Blizz_Craig> @insane_109_ Just as a heads up, its possible to get misaligned OW coin balance because you may buy a bundle where you already own an item from that bundle which throws it off an even amount of coins

[2022-12-20 20:52:20] <%IrZKuma> @einherjar95 basically, your rank badge changed, but it still recognises your previous ELO/MMR and so you are actually considered a higher rank than your rank badge shows. you just need to grind games to get that up. this is the same for your team mates and enemies and so the games are all over the place with ranks

[2022-12-20 20:54:39] <+ScreamingFroggi> Hey @Blizz_Craig , I've been getting put against diamonds and masters a lot on tank lately, and constantly losing and feeling like I can't help out. I have like 500hrs on this game so I'm not new :// what do you suggest?
[2022-12-20 20:54:44] <jeremy_council> So if I don't play one of the roles, am I just gonna drop further at the end of the season? I dropped from diamond to gold. Am I gonna be playing with diamond players at silver next??

[2022-12-20 20:56:15] <!%Blizz_Craig> @ScreamingFroggi Well patience on our part, as mentioned in the blog that Flats read, we are working to better align the skill levels of each role to each other in matches, but that is in progress. Otherwise, remember the basics, play to survive, try to coordinate with your team, and play heroes you are comfortable with.
[2022-12-20 20:56:17] <+Kuraned> you just need them to agree to open teams so you can 4 tank them

[2022-12-20 20:59:03] <trollkidtrolls> guys what's the catch of the 1 coin
[2022-12-20 20:59:12] <@%chompchomp8> @Nam3l3ss__ yes normally theyre much more expensive
[2022-12-20 20:59:12] <%+WellbeWelloff> @trollkidtrolls nothing
[2022-12-20 20:59:14] <smittyverse> The rank system needs a whole new system tbh
[2022-12-20 20:59:15] <%digitalhadoken1> you fix it by certain ranks needing lower rank up requirements

[2022-12-20 20:59:37] <@%chompchomp8> @uooydx if you bought individual items from bundles it would also make your coin count not a round number, this isnt new

[2022-12-20 21:00:06] <Eastsided> Not relevant to GMs but I’m plat and the games I’ve gotten this season are absurd. Constantly playing against masters/gm challengers. Pretty sure it has to do with the lower ranks allowing queuing and everyone being brought down. Might have to take a break till it’s fixed

[2022-12-20 21:01:08] <neutralcritic> no way of knowing precisely how many wins you need. mmr and elo function as a result of the exact mmrs or elos of everyone playing in each game. so perhaps for well earned wins may rank you up as much as 5 soft ball wins.

[2022-12-20 21:44:34] <%m1lkshakey> @thepaleredhorse Bof3 implies there's only 3 maps played. So there would be a tiebreaker involved if the teams went 1-1-1. First to 2 means they have to keep playing until someone wins 2 maps. Can't have 8 draws in a row because control and escort can't end in a draw :)

[2022-12-20 21:56:28] <%+Quizzystyle> i bet flats is using gaming pc as streaming pc also cause i play on max settings with also a 3090 and i get better fps
[2022-12-20 21:56:28] <D1G1TALD0LPH1N> can someone explain why flats complains about having 200 fps? like is that not enough? I know they have mad gamer skills but there's a limit to how much you can use no?
[2022-12-20 21:56:29] <%$jasonwocky> it's been fluctuating down to even 60
[2022-12-20 21:56:42] <%+kevinda1987> thats why you dont keep PH up in the background

[2022-12-20 21:57:24] <!%randomvstheworld> @D1G1TALD0LPH1N the issue is that is not consistent, when you drop frames you feel the game struggling, that's the issue not the frames by themselves
[2022-12-20 21:57:26] <+TheOrganizedAnarchy> @D1G1TALD0LPH1N if you are used to 300fps it dropping can throw you off, same with if your used to 60 and start playing at higher
[2022-12-20 21:57:38] <%Tunt_Life> Its about input lag chat. Also you can see big frame dips even if they are high fps. A frame dip from 300 to 200 is def noticable and the game will hitch
[2022-12-20 21:57:43] <%+Dracoknight500> … I feel like a noob cus I used to play OW at 60fps before I got my new pc for like… 3 years

[2022-12-20 21:58:34] <jennpenn10> yeah 120 frames feel so different to 60. Also i have 2 monitors where onw has a slight delay for inputs and the other doesnt. Completely throws off gameplay.

[2022-12-20 23:08:46] <vergil_hc> @The_Great_Rabbi_Balboa well toyota and Lexus aren't really S tier, compared to other manufacturers. :D

[2022-12-20 23:08:55] <+ItJustGotRielle> the mental drain of playing your hardest and getting stomped is not insignificant, it's no wonder that no one is enthusiast for another game haha
[2022-12-20 23:08:56] <+hkbrill> its like one coin I havent spent a single dollar and still got the skin
[2022-12-20 23:09:12] <Criller128> An unpopular opinion.. I kinda miss the loot boxes..

[2022-12-20 23:16:00] <Gdorf> I feel like there should be solid counterpicks, but I don't think the counterpicks to any character should be in the same role as that character. Like how Ana is a counter to Hog, and not like Orisa is a counter to Doom. The counter pick should not be up to the mirror imo.
[2022-12-20 23:16:20] <owbandit> Are drops on?

[2022-12-20 23:32:24] <%negatiiviity> It’s kind of really frustrating that for rein to be good at high ranks he has to have Lucio speed.
[2022-12-20 23:32:26] <Graf3X> blizzard devs : "Soj isn't the problem, we should nerf mercy"
[2022-12-20 23:32:26] <Hussain_Kazmi> reach level 45 bp

[2022-12-20 23:34:58] <%+YaboiYarn> They need to buff Rein to relevency or the game is in trouble
[2022-12-20 23:34:59] <Baby_B34r> indeed, you neede the speed

[2022-12-20 23:35:19] <Baby_B34r> y does a melee character not have higher speed as a passive???
[2022-12-20 23:35:22] <%+kazenblade29> Lucio and Kiriko would’ve been so much better
[2022-12-20 23:35:23] <Gdorf> @YaboiYarn If reinhardt is a good character, the game is good.
[2022-12-20 23:35:23] <g_00bie> Aren’t they reworking hog?
[2022-12-20 23:35:28] <+GoldClassGaming> @YaboiYarn iirc devs said that Rein is getting buffed in the Mid season. Firestrike back to 100 and maybe some other stuff.
[2022-12-20 23:35:29] <vegito_shadow> common sense left the chat in that game bruv

[2022-12-20 23:35:40] <%da_borg> @YaboiYarn  how? every single character added to the game since the begining has a movement ability
[2022-12-20 23:35:41] <%iliketoeatpineapples> that ana switch from lucio from the first fight reminds me of when a support switch from ana to moira cause he got dove and killed OMEGALUL
[2022-12-20 23:35:45] <Gdorf> @g_00bie Mid January I believe.
[2022-12-20 23:35:46] <%$SeroSerotonin> Rein should get a speed increase the longer he swings his hammer
[2022-12-20 23:35:47] <+citizendolan> Chat im just tuning in has there been much jojo style ram punching today? If so how has he seemed? somewhat viable?
[2022-12-20 23:35:49] <Criller128> @Gdorf - Isn't Flats one of the best Reins in the game?

[2022-12-20 23:36:04] <%+Gibson7202> Maybe they thought Nano rein would be good but speed is needed
[2022-12-20 23:36:04] <%+N3vrenough> 🍞
[2022-12-20 23:36:07] <%+kazenblade29> Rein should have a charge speed buff. Instantly Mach speed at an enemy
[2022-12-20 23:36:23] <%+BluebutBallsy> Hey flats, now that a lot of the drama has finished for the most part, have you thought about switching from twitch to a different platform such as youtube? Seems like most creators have had to think of it lately
[2022-12-20 23:36:33] <Baby_B34r> rein needs some kind of speed passive
[2022-12-20 23:36:33] <%$dmwparker> Any Bloons today?
[2022-12-20 23:36:34] <koochie_man7> I thought Lucio was a good pick for rein bc of speed boost
[2022-12-20 23:36:35] <%da_borg> why does rien have a warm up to charge animation when soj just hits 100% movment in a slide instantly
[2022-12-20 23:36:37] <Graf3X> all flats is saying is he wants to be covered and go ram with speed, what chat, what
[2022-12-20 23:36:39] <QYXilver> hey @flats, I didnt recieve a message that u went live. Did u send one, or my messaging just bugged?
[2022-12-20 23:36:42] <Gdorf> @Criller128 idk man. He's the only Rein I know. But he's the only tank streamer I follow so idk.

[2022-12-20 23:46:16] <+GoldClassGaming> @GoldClassGaming I mean there ARE maps that Ramattra is really good on. My point is that unlike some tanks, Ramattra isn't really a solo playmaker as much as he leads the charge with a team that is actively supporting him and following his lead.

[2022-12-20 23:48:15] <%iliketoeatpineapples> moira players  OMEGALUL
[2022-12-20 23:48:16] <%Ocara115> People like that are just craving attention that they didnt get as children because their parents dont love them
[2022-12-20 23:48:16] <%SpaceCircus_> @houfed they told them to ult or else they lost point and homie kept feeding
[2022-12-20 23:48:25] <%strumpro> @sylphrena94 have they not been doing that already KEKW

[2022-12-20 23:48:28] <yMxrdi> Nicest moira main:
[2022-12-20 23:48:31] <$TheMartian_X> if you're gonna report him, do it in game... maybe the new system will actually catch it?
[2022-12-20 23:48:32] <%+Raptorgod_> dont put him in yt he doesnt deserve it
[2022-12-20 23:48:34] <Les_OW> Titok Moira at its finest
[2022-12-20 23:48:38] <%biostrings> The moira just wants the attention their parents never gave
[2022-12-20 23:48:43] <+Its_Crispy24> Some people really do need mental health if they're getting upset that much
[2022-12-20 23:48:43] <aurum2k> guys stop flaming the Moira, it's not their fault they're being put in a lobby they don't belong in. we just got confirmation in a blizzard post that bronze players in gm lobbies is BY DESIGN.
[2022-12-20 23:48:59] <%+amr183> @left4dinner I think orisa is good since you can get him out of the block with the spear
[2022-12-20 23:49:09] <%da_borg> HEY FLATS can we get the replay code after??

[2022-12-20 23:49:13] <+GoldClassGaming> @left4dinner Orisa is pretty solid into Ram since Javelin Spin is one of the like 3 things in this game that can block Nemesis Punches
[2022-12-20 23:49:14] <%iliketoeatpineapples> nah the problem is playing F-cking MOIRA in comp. she belongs in QP ONLY  OMEGALUL
[2022-12-20 23:49:15] <%SpaceCircus_> i wonder who is the moira's mirror on the other team
[2022-12-20 23:49:17] <Criller128> Is this top 500 btw?
[2022-12-20 23:49:21] <%+Zealith_Gamer> so you're playing 1 tank 3 dps and 1 heals?
[2022-12-20 23:49:24] <zarall> @aurum2k what?????
[2022-12-20 23:49:28] <Korporal_Kagger> soldier more healing than moira
[2022-12-20 23:49:31] <%Keystone4274> Shambali is just all up hill so obviously favors defence
[2022-12-20 23:49:33] <noonumberrs> Your Moira is tryna play sombra
[2022-12-20 23:49:35] <infamous_paragon> @aurum2k Their playstyle is horrible no matter the rank  KEKW
[2022-12-20 23:49:37] <samfi> wait the moira actually has less heals than soldier???
[2022-12-20 23:49:39] <dnegus> @aurum2k nah bro 1k healing shows she isn't even making an attempt to heal, we can flame her
[2022-12-20 23:49:40] <Xeredge> Oof the 4v5
[2022-12-20 23:49:47] <Rozmamas> @aurum2k they’re still throwing and getting mad?
[2022-12-20 23:49:56] VIEWERS: 3 578
[2022-12-20 23:49:58] <Xeredge> 1k healing is prob healing herself lol
[2022-12-20 23:50:02] <djzander_> bro moira is literally one of if not the easiest supports to get raw numbers on in dmg and heals, it’s sad that they have literally neither
[2022-12-20 23:50:02] <%iliketoeatpineapples> he's probably the moira player
[2022-12-20 23:50:10] <Middra_> what is tiktok moira? is it just reddit lucio but moira?
[2022-12-20 23:50:11] <%+BluebutBallsy> @Xeredge facts xD

[2022-12-20 23:50:13] <%iliketoeatpineapples> that's why he's protecting him  OMEGALUL
[2022-12-20 23:50:14] <%+WanderingWarden> 9 deaths.
[2022-12-20 23:50:17] <%biostrings> Moira's not worth our time, probably gonna look at chat and feel special
[2022-12-20 23:50:19] <dnegus> @djzander_ this

[2022-12-20 23:50:28] <Korporal_Kagger> @Middra_ it's dps flank moira
[2022-12-20 23:50:32] <%$kaos1120x> I'm late, but this is ranked, right?
[2022-12-20 23:50:35] <aurum2k> don't get me wrong, the Moira is complete ass.
[2022-12-20 23:50:42] <+Its_Crispy24> The Moira has to be inting now LUL
[2022-12-20 23:50:42] <Rozmamas> Yes ranked

[2022-12-20 23:50:56] <Mazzah___> dps moira
[2022-12-20 23:50:57] <djzander_> better then the moira heals tbh
[2022-12-20 23:50:57] <%iliketoeatpineapples> i would rather take reddit lucio than tiktok moira. lucio's ult has it's ult than moira's  OMEGALUL
[2022-12-20 23:50:58] <%+heytwink> KEKW
[2022-12-20 23:51:00] <%+sylphrena94> thank god for soldier
[2022-12-20 23:51:02] <%+Corutoo> i really thought u only see these type of players in lower elo
[2022-12-20 23:51:04] <g_00bie> How much dmg does the Moira have?
[2022-12-20 23:51:06] <%iliketoeatpineapples> use*
[2022-12-20 23:51:09] <Luzciel> Please upload this @Flats
[2022-12-20 23:51:11] <%+Gibson7202> Now the "come to me for healing" line from Soldier makes sense
[2022-12-20 23:51:11] <%+heytwink> Report that Moira to the devs honestly
[2022-12-20 23:51:14] <+ugimugi> man orisa might as well be melee such a weird kit
[2022-12-20 23:51:14] <%+kazenblade29> Tik tok moira
[2022-12-20 23:51:15] <Silent_DC> @KitetsuSokushi for solo q i personally like zar, you can charge up while baiting out her cd's
[2022-12-20 23:51:16] <R0YALDRAGN> this moira, Thats all that needs said
[2022-12-20 23:51:16] <t_aric> certainly an experience...
[2022-12-20 23:51:17] <%SpaceCircus_> soldier heals actually doing more
[2022-12-20 23:51:19] <@%$R3trohowling> @Luzciel Absolutely not
[2022-12-20 23:51:31] <@%$R3trohowling> Doesnt deserve the attention
[2022-12-20 23:51:33] <%Keystone4274> Most support heros should have more damage because they are support not only healers but I can argue that the Moira should probably be healing more
[2022-12-20 23:51:34] <%+BluebutBallsy> Honestly, I know Im not hte best player, but I HATE playing a tank and getting no support or DPS and standing in front of the fucking support and still not getting healed. I want them to add bans at this point so I can ban moira and hog
[2022-12-20 23:51:35] <%biostrings> In other news, this orisa vs ramattra actually looks like some fun gameplay

[2022-12-20 23:53:35] <%iliketoeatpineapples> when i have a teammate that instalock moira.. i know how it will goes. OMEGALUL
[2022-12-20 23:53:36] <djzander_> i hate the bad rep moira players give cuz she’s honestly rlly enjoyable to me
[2022-12-20 23:53:36] <+aaymon86> Why does the list even have a limit???
[2022-12-20 23:53:36] <%$atsBrew> @kairos_ow oh hello, ggs dude peepoSit
[2022-12-20 23:53:37] <%$PayneofTrain> that Moira probably got roasted in a bronze roast and then bought an account to punish top players
[2022-12-20 23:53:37] <yesvenox> istg today is a rough day, always have these kind of mates on my team..
[2022-12-20 23:53:37] <%+emilionario_> @WanderingWarden thx
[2022-12-20 23:53:39] <%negatiiviity> Honestly that Moira was bronze 5.
[2022-12-20 23:53:39] <+Its_Crispy24> You can only avoid 3 people??
[2022-12-20 23:53:40] <Luzciel> Look at their account? @Flats
[2022-12-20 23:53:40] <+pootymcgoods> why isnt the avoid list longer lmoa
[2022-12-20 23:53:40] <%+TheMrUnorthodox> why did he throw?
[2022-12-20 23:53:45] <+ruckwon_thechef> people see this and yell at anyone who plays Moira
[2022-12-20 23:53:46] <yMxrdi> It’s actually funny bcs in silver (like me xd) most moira only heal bot
[2022-12-20 23:53:46] <%+heytwink> I feel like if the avoid list was 6 it would be perfect
[2022-12-20 23:53:47] <+kino7000> I report every option, then repeat
[2022-12-20 23:53:47] <%da_borg> flats, watch  his replay while queue!
[2022-12-20 23:53:47] <%+Kaeldrys_> I think moira avoid shouldn't count towards the total
[2022-12-20 23:53:50] <+galvanash> @Flats So when is the "I played with a bronze 5 moira in gm" youtube video?

[2022-12-20 23:54:08] <BlyatComrade> It's the mapwide autoaim. It literally rots Moira player brains LUL
[2022-12-20 23:54:10] <octopaid> roast her
[2022-12-20 23:54:11] <jed_prusso> Thanks @dnegus
[2022-12-20 23:54:12] <%+kazenblade29> He can heal everyone at once in a small circle
[2022-12-20 23:54:13] <ultravioience1> How did he not get more healing from just healing himself?
[2022-12-20 23:54:15] <floofous> @Flats i definitely think they need more avoid slots
[2022-12-20 23:54:17] <%$kaos1120x> moving on
[2022-12-20 23:54:18] <%Ocara115> Are they actually in gm or just a diamond player that wanted attention?

[2022-12-20 23:54:29] <%+acesif> So whats ur thoughts on ram flats?
[2022-12-20 23:54:30] <the_real_casual> ramattra worth grindung for?
[2022-12-20 23:54:34] <%biostrings> @Ocara115 there's no way to know anymore
[2022-12-20 23:54:36] <yMxrdi> How is remmatra doing in comp?
[2022-12-20 23:54:37] <+dhuelsman> they have to have a balanced team mmr....and that's what you get for your troubles
[2022-12-20 23:54:37] <Silent_DC> I feel like there shouldn't be a limit to the avoid list. if it is for competive integrity than there should just not be one at all or it should not be limited
[2022-12-20 23:54:39] <%SpaceCircus_> @Gibson7202 they most likely arent the mmr economy budget probably gave them just that to work with for their team overall
[2022-12-20 23:54:44] <MrPunyama> Do they just climb because people refuse to go tank buster when they do this and run at the enemy tank.
[2022-12-20 23:54:45] <+Cheesie_Muffin> this season made me stop playing ranked for how it is just against flex players now

[2022-12-20 23:55:21] <%iliketoeatpineapples> they should remove moira being played in rank/comp  OMEGALUL
[2022-12-20 23:55:22] <aurum2k> wait what happened in the tournament?
[2022-12-20 23:55:23] <akaLazer_> id say their healing was self healing off passive but they fed on cooldown and died far too often to even make use of the passive
[2022-12-20 23:55:23] <kingwall1458> yall is there a way to know my battle net account? i made mine and forgot lol (ps5)
[2022-12-20 23:55:25] <%+kazenblade29> As a tank player it pisses me off seeing supports not doing their job

[2022-12-20 23:55:31] <djzander_> they should increase avoid player limit, if you run into a 4 stack of toxic ppl you can’t even avoid them all
[2022-12-20 23:55:34] <BushkaPlays> tourney update?
[2022-12-20 23:55:35] <tap_alonez> happy queing!

[2022-12-20 23:57:56] <%The23776> the issue is , its such a common thing that most average players do, if they did ban all instances of that, they would lose a large % of the playerbase which = a large % of people not buying skins 4Head

[2022-12-20 23:58:14] <MrPunyama> I gave up and start Orisa every game cause if I monkey or rein eventually they go hog after I shit on them
[2022-12-20 23:58:16] <%+storms_> so is orisa actually good now or was she always good and getting outshined by other tanks?
[2022-12-20 23:58:16] <%+amr183> @amr183 Tbh I don't want her to be the new hog she is the most fun hero to play aside from rein
[2022-12-20 23:58:16] <dnegus> @criller128 when didn't she shit on doomfist in ow2?
[2022-12-20 23:58:17] <+GoldClassGaming> @da_borg Ramattra is pretty good, but is more teamplay dependent than tanks like Hog or Orisa. If your team plays around you then you can go nuts but if your team isn't getting in the mix with you then you can get overwhelmed very quickly
[2022-12-20 23:58:20] <+citizendolan> @gibson7202 i think that was true before his buff but i do think he plays differently with the speed increase and armor - he can dive in a bit more even if its not on the level of monke
[2022-12-20 23:58:22] <Criller128> Or rather - Flats Orisa shits on Doomfist now
[2022-12-20 23:58:24] <+kalel987> @Flats what directly counters ramattra as a dps?
