[2023-01-05 10:03:24] <%millssy6> either works
[2023-01-05 10:03:25] <%DesurokuDesso> Hi Dev
[2023-01-05 10:03:26] <%justpeeinginthewind> You get someone else to do it

[2023-01-05 10:03:47] <%1mthattwitch> @dontlookaroundyousilly bro, keep the thoughts inside
[2023-01-05 10:03:48] <%seethingaardvark> Technically you should peel away to minimise risk, but I don't think many people actually do
[2023-01-05 10:03:53] <%Strange_Bru> Cut towards your chum, not towards your thumb. You can always get another chum
[2023-01-05 10:03:56] <maniakzak> just getting everything cooked right is the hard bit
[2023-01-05 10:03:58] <BitWoodyy> why aren't you using your new slicer!!

[2023-01-05 10:04:05] <tera65> the way you have the most control while peeling is the best way

[2023-01-05 10:04:12] <lena_is_sleepy> Ur not supposed to peal it  towards you cus you might cut ur self but I like to peal towards me
[2023-01-05 10:04:16] <%wickedsteel78> I was always told to peel away from you
[2023-01-05 10:04:17] <+Whatchafinnado> hi

[2023-01-05 10:04:57] <%1mthattwitch> isn't that how you're meant to cut the carrot?
[2023-01-05 10:05:02] <!%uzimerce> the same pressure it takes to bite through the thick part of a carrot is the same as a finger
[2023-01-05 10:05:02] <%knightzz18> Hi chat

[2023-01-05 10:06:36] <techygirl93> well, is it because of pain receptors that would stop you from eating through it? That is only if you're biting your own finger
[2023-01-05 10:06:36] <%seethingaardvark> Need a sharp knife for that
[2023-01-05 10:06:37] <DontLookAroundYouSilly> U are goals <3

[2023-01-05 10:32:13] <%dbg_1> @deweytalks  The salt and butter are optional, so only rice and water are essential. The proportions are generally two to one: two cups of water to one cup of rice. 2. Add the rice, ½ teaspoon of salt and 1 tablespoon of butter, stir once.

[2023-01-05 10:34:04] <%dbg_1> @YellowBanana69 Why You Should Always Wash Rice. The reason for washing rice (or any food, for that matter) is cleanliness. Rinsing rice removes dirt, dust, debris, chemicals, and bugs—in short, you're getting rid of the types of things you probably don't want to eat in your finished rice dish. this is actually on google
[2023-01-05 10:34:07] <!%uzimerce> dev is a woolworths girl alot more respect for you now
[2023-01-05 10:34:08] <+NightStreamer21> whats the Entree ?
[2023-01-05 10:34:12] <+TheMashupman> @1mthattwitch Dev dropped it in a bowl of Tzatziki at the Friendmas party.. after which Fasffy decided to rinse it.. Then he spent a few days in a bowl of rice to dry and he is fine now.

[2023-01-05 11:53:36] <%RoyalRumbleFTW> is the relationship over if they say no?
[2023-01-05 11:53:37] <%kane_ong> on April fool Kappa can literally take rejection like a boss LUL

[2023-01-05 11:55:34] <+CrimsonCarnotaurus> I have heard about a proposal being rejected because he was seen as cheap for using an emerald ring instead of diamond even though emeralds are rarer and more valuable

[2023-01-05 12:01:05] <%+Auct> I wouldn't spend much money on a ring in general. Even the wedding ring will definitely not be more than 1k. It'll be a lab rock
