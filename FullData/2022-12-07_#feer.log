[2022-12-07 18:08:37] <Aggressive_rl> were is the increment ?
[2022-12-07 18:08:43] <%paraNoiding> dragon hides every time a goal goes in
[2022-12-07 18:08:49] <%paraNoiding> then comes back out at kickoff
[2022-12-07 18:09:00] <pedror1410> they throw hands probably
[2022-12-07 18:09:08] <subhadeepsub> Best map so far imo
[2022-12-07 18:09:14] <%paraNoiding> I thought they both hid but could just be 1
[2022-12-07 18:09:14] <pineapplefan2> dragons are cool and all but i d prefere a good map
[2022-12-07 18:09:18] <Rusherrr> they ABSOLUTELY need a floating island map
[2022-12-07 18:09:19] <ayushsaini20021974> Feer do you know where is Ashllxyy ?
[2022-12-07 18:09:22] <supremegreatness> @Feer do you have showmatches planned for after rlcs?
[2022-12-07 18:09:31] <xii_evan_xii> @feer the pogo is very low so you dont have much time to push
[2022-12-07 18:09:36] <pedror1410> @Rusherrr sunken ship too
[2022-12-07 18:09:42] <+codingcampbell> why do they keep remixing this exact map. maybe for chinese new year

[2022-12-07 18:10:08] <i8nc> Nugget smart
[2022-12-07 18:10:08] <%jellymwoan> whats the maps name
[2022-12-07 18:10:11] <bcwishkiller> dark doesnt shoot if the defender doesnt approach tho
[2022-12-07 18:10:14] <ratsammich> They need a map that just legit looks like a hamburger stand
[2022-12-07 18:10:15] <dehbroski> If they just made the cars slightly lighter
[2022-12-07 18:10:20] <bcwishkiller> he lets it bounce closer to net
[2022-12-07 18:10:23] <dehbroski> Reminds me of Beckwith night
[2022-12-07 18:10:31] <kukmanen2005> i think the contrast between blue and orange side is just too big.
[2022-12-07 18:10:32] <supremegreatness> Btw is the 3s tourney on liqui?
[2022-12-07 18:10:40] <BoggedAlo> I think it's their decals that break it
[2022-12-07 18:10:47] <supremegreatness> IceCold
[2022-12-07 18:10:55] <%+eyeless_42> dragon lookin like Sid from ice age
[2022-12-07 18:11:00] <mikedashyt> That map is so cool
[2022-12-07 18:11:05] <ratsammich> Dark is a one trick

[2022-12-07 18:14:43] <optailz> KEKW
[2022-12-07 18:14:43] <rando65qq> has dark ever used fennec?
[2022-12-07 18:14:44] <%clorpp> ayjayy meta
[2022-12-07 18:14:49] <kmdoqp> Infinite levels of placebo
[2022-12-07 18:15:11] <wendys_fo_fo_fo> I’m guessing it’s okay if it’s just the decal lol
[2022-12-07 18:15:11] <ratsammich> It’s probably because this map fucking blows and he’s in his head about it
[2022-12-07 18:15:11] <+paperjamxnz> it's also not a money showmatch atm
[2022-12-07 18:15:12] <Desbooom> decal matters
[2022-12-07 18:15:12] <optailz> I don't care lmao
[2022-12-07 18:15:13] <@%^Nightbot> Instagram your thing? Check out Feer's new one! https://www.instagram.com/feertwitch/
[2022-12-07 18:15:14] <%paraNoiding> technically fennec -> octane is also placebo
[2022-12-07 18:15:15] <meeechi> i mean u need a glowing car like nuggets on this map
[2022-12-07 18:15:17] <DankensteinL> people be willin'
[2022-12-07 18:15:19] <Desbooom> u dont understand. Some decals feel weak and not "tryhard" enough
[2022-12-07 18:15:20] <%+lifeRL6> this one is ok because he got back before the game started @feer
[2022-12-07 18:15:21] <Maybe__Jack> If a placebo lets him come back from 7-1, let him have it
[2022-12-07 18:15:25] <subhadeepsub> This too free
[2022-12-07 18:15:26] <pedror1410> clearly didnt work lol
[2022-12-07 18:15:28] <MadPulp> its not a sub, its just changing ur shirt :]
[2022-12-07 18:15:32] <+DjSpary> @Maybe__Jack this
[2022-12-07 18:15:32] <+theesmokingod> some of these placebos are crazy
[2022-12-07 18:15:35] <+d4nkf1re> ii think we get em on a normaql map some too this could effect their game this maps crazy
[2022-12-07 18:15:45] <trx3> give nugget a goal for next game
[2022-12-07 18:15:51] <turki273903> he needs to change his mind
[2022-12-07 18:15:59] <%+eyeless_42> its the map bro Kappa
[2022-12-07 18:16:01] <Sweet4U> I feel like you're putting yourself at a disadvantage either way, hitbox changes shouldn't be considered "cheating"
[2022-12-07 18:16:19] <supremegreatness> Does anyobody know who masterio is? that one guy who recently got 1 in 1s
