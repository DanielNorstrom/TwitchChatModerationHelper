[2022-12-27 12:39:23] <+Bradical13> because its HARD and doing HARD things is tough and we are wired to stay away from stuggling by struggling is how we progress

[2022-12-27 12:41:49] <Spiderurben> In my opinion you need to enjoy the process of change and also make it as automated as possible. For example I started working out and keep doing it cause I'm enjoying it but at some point once I don't enjoy it anymore I'll probably keep doing it cause I've been doing it for a long time
[2022-12-27 12:41:52] <%Hulk_DK> I am totally motivated to get up at 4.30 every morning to go to work, because i am committed to my work and people depend on my. Therefore i must be disciplined to get out of bed - as an example

[2022-12-27 16:34:35] <ResurrectionByElection> still shouldn't turn off avoidance, at least it doesnt in pob. maybe it wasnt an ignite but some burning aura? like metamorph had rf? pepeLaugh
[2022-12-27 16:35:22] <likkevrom> i got fire exposure from the metamorph too, but it showed the ignite debuff icon on my bar - unless it shows that even when immune?
[2022-12-27 16:35:34] <ResurrectionByElection> did it have a timer?
[2022-12-27 16:35:38] <likkevrom> yes

[2022-12-27 16:42:50] <%pdiddly63> BBQ is turkish

[2022-12-27 16:43:10] <Slemsvamp> i dunno, people were saying it was from somewhere else, but to be honest i think that goes for anything food related
[2022-12-27 16:43:18] <+youngdapperlad> Uh no its not
[2022-12-27 16:43:20] <Kamegon> there is a version of bbq in every culture.. argentina, turkish lol
[2022-12-27 16:43:26] <ZelViuS> french fries isnt french Despairge
[2022-12-27 16:43:30] <Kamegon> so no it has not been "debunked"
[2022-12-27 16:43:34] <+youngdapperlad> Roasting meat over a fire is an ancient thing, we're talking modern bbq
[2022-12-27 16:43:35] <%pdiddly63> slathering meats with spices and slow cooking them in holes in the ground with smoke is everywhere
[2022-12-27 16:43:39] <!%warfirev> Patagonian BBQ is the shit, sooo good
[2022-12-27 16:43:54] <Slemsvamp> i mean, someone heated up meat at one point, so i guess it's all from there (except vegetables etc)
[2022-12-27 16:44:08] <Kamegon> @pdiddly63 not all us bbq is put in a hole, in fact most is not slow cooked in a hole
[2022-12-27 16:44:20] <%pdiddly63> regional cultural foods boils down to what natively grows there
[2022-12-27 16:44:21] <!%warfirev> @nugiyen no flask automation?

[2022-12-27 16:45:27] <!%warfirev> You can set it to only use when full, so it will not be used unless full, but it means you have it up for mapping
