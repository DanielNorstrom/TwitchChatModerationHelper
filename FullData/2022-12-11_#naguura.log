[2022-12-11 02:39:11] <+Dejablue> At least it isnt like Legion where you play the toon that got the random Leggo upgrade
[2022-12-11 02:39:13] <+neels_ofc> the weirdest part is they all levelled 7-10 chars and they still ask for helpers for splits
[2022-12-11 02:39:18] <+TheunGaming> the TLDR is more splits means you can guarantee set bonuses on players
[2022-12-11 02:39:29] <+neels_ofc> they gonna funnel SO many of these chars
[2022-12-11 02:39:29] <bantsisback> with group loot splits are actually more important
[2022-12-11 02:40:00] <alex_dfb> i guess they want to make sure they have potentially strong specific classes ready and geared if certain bosses require them?

[2022-12-11 04:12:31] <+nuka73> og of MMO is everquest  and wow too but EQ came out in 1999
[2022-12-11 04:12:33] <hughesbassangler> First MMO ever was the game in the day
[2022-12-11 04:12:38] <+rolandoenserio> It should be cherished, for some of us that play multiple mmos it's so fun to see the crosspollinization
[2022-12-11 04:12:42] <melgibsonsson> grill
[2022-12-11 04:12:43] <BigBoiButts> GuildWars stole flying from spyro on ps1 so its all good
[2022-12-11 04:12:45] <%+JoeySawyers> Naguura why is League a hellscape rn
[2022-12-11 04:12:49] <capitalccg> I mean, Warcraft didn‚Äôt invent elves, dragons, orcs, it‚Äôs all recycled
[2022-12-11 04:12:57] <%+JoeySawyers> I've had an afk in literally every game
[2022-12-11 04:13:00] <+KiroSlays> didnt even no guild wars still existed lol
[2022-12-11 04:13:04] <nay_thn> I'd argue to say that most modern MMOs wouldn't exist without having had WoW pave the way.
[2022-12-11 04:13:04] <+Titocurl> Dota did
[2022-12-11 04:13:06] <+nowshido> dota
[2022-12-11 04:13:07] <+domuez> WC3 dota
[2022-12-11 04:13:07] <+HoggyX1> dota
[2022-12-11 04:13:10] <Zierohour> it was a warcraft mod
[2022-12-11 04:13:10] <+Slikey94> battle royal started as a minecraft mod
[2022-12-11 04:13:11] <+HoggyX1> a mod from WC3
[2022-12-11 04:13:12] <bae_kyuun> I can't believe pong stole from tennis
[2022-12-11 04:13:14] <+KiroSlays> Dota Warcraft 3
[2022-12-11 04:13:17] <+nav0nod1989> wc3 come on
[2022-12-11 04:13:18] <+Titocurl> which stole WC3 lol
[2022-12-11 04:13:18] <%+emb1t> It was a guy who made the mode for Dota 1 and MOBA was born
[2022-12-11 04:13:19] <Zierohour> dota was a warcraft 3 mod.
[2022-12-11 04:13:24] <+Asura_Shini> I mean thats kind of innovation
[2022-12-11 04:13:26] <Cyanyc> It was a warcraft mod so technically it was "stolen"
[2022-12-11 04:13:27] <+nav0nod1989> you have no idea what your talki g about lolololol
[2022-12-11 04:13:28] <+JustDivis> Minecraft Hunger Games was the first BR
[2022-12-11 04:13:30] <Kidritch> and it's ok

[2022-12-11 04:13:41] <+nuka73> mobas came out rts game like starcraft and wc3 ect
[2022-12-11 04:13:44] <+Slikey94> evolution of the genre comes with cross inspiration
[2022-12-11 04:13:46] <+HawkKin> Dota is not from wc3. It is originally from starcraft
[2022-12-11 04:13:48] <+nav0nod1989> im just hear for drops but i cant handle this lol
[2022-12-11 04:13:49] <BirdmanHosehead> i miss flying without having to do anything
[2022-12-11 04:13:50] <%afishinsea> everyone keeps stealing the "being a video game" aspect from pong tbh
[2022-12-11 04:13:55] <hughesbassangler> I like wow a lot more but I can tell you right now EverQuest was the first MMO guaranteed it‚Äôs really not debatable
[2022-12-11 04:13:56] <%+Turtle_drew> @xiESCANOR Thanks for the gift sub!
[2022-12-11 04:13:59] <Kidritch> good competition is healthy for the market and consumers

[2022-12-11 04:14:12] <+eric__tyler> Blizzard has almost always taken ideas from elsewhere and improved on them.
[2022-12-11 04:14:13] <%xavier2119> @Kidritch Exactly
[2022-12-11 04:14:14] <+Titocurl> I guess loving GW2 and seeing wow do flight exactly the same felt like it robbed me? Hard to explain lol
[2022-12-11 04:14:15] <+KiroSlays> What channel will be on through the race?
[2022-12-11 04:14:17] <hughesbassangler> What was before EverQuest??
[2022-12-11 04:14:25] <gautelo> That's how innovation works, right? Incremental improvements!
[2022-12-11 04:14:26] <+Austinbostonx> wow a lot of viewers naguura! you should move to LA PogChamp
[2022-12-11 04:14:27] <%Ghamera> Ultima Online

[2022-12-11 04:14:49] <Lorehammer1988> wow is a better DnD computer game then all DnD computer games
[2022-12-11 04:14:50] <+Titocurl> @zebracak35 like seeing someone take your idea in class or something you know
[2022-12-11 04:14:52] <Kidritch> @Ghamera UO was my jam back in the late 90s!
[2022-12-11 04:15:01] <hughesbassangler> Ultima good just not a MMO like EverQuest
[2022-12-11 04:15:03] <+Grrezy> I missed the past 5 minutes, As soon as you said wow stole, it went to commercial. Theyre watching
[2022-12-11 04:15:07] <+2inconsteveable> I feel fortnite did that with some of Apex stuff

[2022-12-11 04:15:34] <+KiroSlays> .... Guild Wars copied wow 15 years ago
[2022-12-11 04:15:37] <+KiroSlays> give me a break lol\
[2022-12-11 04:15:42] <%+tanek1966> @hughesbassangler First graphical MMO, though it's debatable with Ultima coming first and there being stuff like Shadows of Yserbius,  Neverwinter Nights (AOL version), but there were lots of text-based MMOs first.
[2022-12-11 04:15:49] <ninespejo> I cant HOVER anymore while flying  they should remove the VIGOR in these expansion
[2022-12-11 04:15:57] <+Grrezy> If GW copied wow, then wow copied everquest
[2022-12-11 04:16:06] <+Shax_____> nothing is original
[2022-12-11 04:16:07] <+Grrezy> and every other mmo that came before
[2022-12-11 04:16:08] <+nuka73> dragonriding is alot similar 2 gw2  flying mounts
[2022-12-11 04:16:08] <Lorehammer1988> any of you ever played hero shadow legends? they steal all sorts of models from WoW. Everywhere steals from other success
[2022-12-11 04:16:09] <hughesbassangler> Yeah but EverQuest paved the way for wow
[2022-12-11 04:16:12] <gautelo> 1500 tattered wildercloth.. zzzzZZzz
[2022-12-11 04:16:13] <%Ghamera> @tanek1966 so much time spent in MUDs

[2022-12-11 04:17:07] <R0seblue> good, you switched from druid to warlock SeemsGood
[2022-12-11 04:17:07] <Kidritch> Meridian 59 is the oldest mmo I can thinkn of
[2022-12-11 04:17:11] <+Grrezy> WoW was good for its candy colors
[2022-12-11 04:17:11] <PaimayTV> me :)
[2022-12-11 04:17:18] <Kidritch> Ultima was from the 80s
[2022-12-11 04:17:21] <hughesbassangler> where just talking about MMOs
[2022-12-11 04:17:32] <hughesbassangler> EverQuest was the first big one
[2022-12-11 04:17:32] <+KiroSlays> What channel will you be streaming the race to first?
[2022-12-11 04:17:37] <+nuka73> nah they came out  from Dungeon and dragons
[2022-12-11 04:17:38] <+christabelle> WoW was highly influenced by DnD, in Classic.
[2022-12-11 04:17:40] <@%Kuroz> team liquid
[2022-12-11 04:17:41] <hughesbassangler> Then 4 years later here comes WOW 2004
[2022-12-11 04:17:47] <hughesbassangler> Boom then it all began
[2022-12-11 04:17:47] <+Phant0mCrash> if you're going to get upset about "copying" then there wouldn't be any genres of music movies or games if people didn't "copy"
[2022-12-11 04:17:52] <reegularshow> hello @Naguura
[2022-12-11 04:17:55] <hughesbassangler> I remember it like it was yesterday
[2022-12-11 04:18:03] <%JDooners> how deep is that bag or Ruffles? I feel like it's lasted hours
[2022-12-11 04:18:05] <Kidritch> 100% it did
[2022-12-11 04:18:06] [Notification] exterminans72 subscribed at Tier 1.
[2022-12-11 04:18:06] <+tokkoa> no
[2022-12-11 04:18:07] <Lorehammer1988> @christabelle  exactly
[2022-12-11 04:18:07] <+nuka73> every mmo is influence by DND
[2022-12-11 04:18:07] <+Aludren> probably some caveman invented RPG, to teach people how to hunt they played a game. LUL
[2022-12-11 04:18:08] <+nowshido> no
[2022-12-11 04:18:10] <Kidritch> they even said it did
[2022-12-11 04:18:12] <+semjay07> 100%
[2022-12-11 04:18:13] <Phractals> no wow copied everquest
[2022-12-11 04:18:13] <hughesbassangler> Wow came from EverQuest
[2022-12-11 04:18:15] <hughesbassangler> Facts
[2022-12-11 04:18:17] <+Oaex11> HELL NO. WoW was a literal icebreaker
[2022-12-11 04:18:17] <+Grrezy> DnD is literally this genre
[2022-12-11 04:18:18] <+Scorpianna> oh of cours
[2022-12-11 04:18:18] <gautelo> absolutely - statlines
[2022-12-11 04:18:18] <sleighher> yes all rpg came from DandD
[2022-12-11 04:18:20] <Cyanyc> Wow came from Everquest yeah
[2022-12-11 04:18:20] <+christabelle> Even down to how long buffs last.
[2022-12-11 04:18:21] <+nowshido> Wow came from Everquest for sure
[2022-12-11 04:18:22] <shirvanas> everything came fomr D&D
[2022-12-11 04:18:22] <%Ghamera> Dungeon and Dragons was adapted from Tolkein, Tolkein took largely from Norse and Germanic Mythology, this goes ALL the way back
[2022-12-11 04:18:23] <%+Mr_Espresso_Bean> inspirations for MMOs or fantasy games have some times to DnD
[2022-12-11 04:18:23] <+ickyweezy> rufffffffffles
[2022-12-11 04:18:23] <+tklurfancy> nah it was built similar to original EQ
[2022-12-11 04:18:24] <Vahln99> WoW came from Everquest. which game from DnD
[2022-12-11 04:18:27] <Clairica> could say it was more "inspiration" than copy
[2022-12-11 04:18:30] <Booma__TV> everything stemed from D&D lol
[2022-12-11 04:18:30] <+Titocurl> and DnD was influenced by JRR Tolkin
[2022-12-11 04:18:34] <jrjursus> g'night!
[2022-12-11 04:18:38] <BirdmanHosehead> DnD came from LotR
[2022-12-11 04:18:38] <Kidritch> DnD definitely spawned all of these games
[2022-12-11 04:18:38] <hughesbassangler> Wow is like EverQuest but way better period.
[2022-12-11 04:18:41] <%+Mr_Espresso_Bean> much like the world of DnD can be said to be inspired by Tolkien
[2022-12-11 04:18:58] [Usernotice] itachi5189 is gifting 2 Tier 1 Subs to Naguura's community! They've gifted a total of 2 in the channel!

[2022-12-11 04:18:59] <+Scorpianna> DnD came in 1975  in pencil and paper
[2022-12-11 04:18:59] <gautelo> every RPG with stat lines and roll to hit
[2022-12-11 04:19:01] <Lorehammer1988> Warrior is a dnd fighter/barbarian
[2022-12-11 04:19:02] <+JustDivis> how did PONG come from DnD? Check mate
[2022-12-11 04:19:02] <rennyrunsamok> Well every fantasy thing came from D&D in one way or another; IIRC WoW was originally meant to be a Warhammer RPG but they couldn't get the rights from Games Workshop? I don't know how true that is!
[2022-12-11 04:19:07] <Kidritch> they took pen and paper adventures and made them into games
[2022-12-11 04:19:07] <Booma__TV> question is what inspired D&D lol jk
[2022-12-11 04:19:11] <+HawkKin> There is not much from blizzard that is not inspired or a straight ripoff from other sources. Gul'dan is from Warhammer 40K so is starcraft
[2022-12-11 04:19:17] <+christabelle> The literal exact DnD spells and classes and buff lengths were used. I've used Hand of Freedom in tabletop, lol.
[2022-12-11 04:19:17] <+Grrezy> rpg games are just a visualization of dnd
[2022-12-11 04:19:18] <%Ghamera> Tolkien took heavily from Norse and Germanic Mythology
[2022-12-11 04:19:24] <+Titocurl> One think I will say about mounts in WoW. At least it doesnt take me a freaking month in game to unlock it LUL GW2 takes sooo much work
[2022-12-11 04:19:30] <+hybridvig0r> what faction is this>?
[2022-12-11 04:19:37] <+Aludren> Pong is just two mages bouncing a fireball back and forth. checkmate mated.
[2022-12-11 04:19:41] <gautelo> nah.. if there's no stats going up with levels it's not dnd based imo
[2022-12-11 04:19:46] <+kelly_mac79> how's the jet lag so far?
[2022-12-11 04:19:47] <+Grrezy> tito just wants everything given to them lol
[2022-12-11 04:19:49] <BigBoiButts> By the end of this we'll be saying the Greeks made rpg's
[2022-12-11 04:19:56] <%Shutty5> Starcraft is a straight ripoff of Warhammer
[2022-12-11 04:19:56] <+Slikey94> Apple hasnt in years
[2022-12-11 04:20:02] <insaniity> the devs for League worked on Dota 1 though @Naguura
[2022-12-11 04:20:02] <+zebracak35> riot strarted up by stealing dota 2 community website

[2022-12-11 04:20:18] <+Aludren> @BigBoiButts before that. I say cavemen. they even had game artwork on the walls. :)
[2022-12-11 04:20:19] <%Ghamera> again, Art started on cave walls...
[2022-12-11 04:20:24] <+Shax_____> why does everything need to be original?
[2022-12-11 04:20:39] <+Titocurl> Only individuals come up  with nea ideas. Dota was one guy and PUBG
[2022-12-11 04:20:43] <+HawkKin> Not exactly what I'm saying. I'm saying even  their lore characters or the story is a straight ripoff. I can understand them not being able to think of a new genre. But just ripping off the lore sometimes literally 1v1 is kinda... yikes @Naguura
[2022-12-11 04:20:46] <+hybridvig0r> is this horde or alliance?
[2022-12-11 04:20:53] <sleighher> I am loving this new expansion myself
[2022-12-11 04:20:56] <+Shatteredmarty> Well, there was this Greek that said there no new ideas. just altered ones\
[2022-12-11 04:20:58] <+Slikey94> tbh Interlectual Property is holding society back in many ways because it limits the ability to iterate on good ideas
[2022-12-11 04:20:59] <+nowshido> DnD Andy's...
[2022-12-11 04:21:09] <hughesbassangler> all I‚Äôm saying is the first big game like wow was EverQuest that was the one to play before wow I promise you guys..
[2022-12-11 04:21:10] <capitalccg> Dragons have been a part of myths and lore for thousands of years, doesn‚Äôt really bother me that WoW has dragons
[2022-12-11 04:21:17] <hughesbassangler> There both very similar
[2022-12-11 04:21:21] <@TeamLiquid> The Team Liquid Mobile App is available NOW  liquidplus.adv.gg/a/m0tCJF
[2022-12-11 04:21:24] <%NaturalJoel> before world of warcraft there was warcraft 1,2,3
[2022-12-11 04:21:31] <pflameg> there are no new stories
[2022-12-11 04:21:33] <+nnhp> @naguura pictures of Illidan and Uther reused drawings of dnd characters
[2022-12-11 04:21:36] <%Shutty5> Arthas is pretty close to Vader lol
[2022-12-11 04:21:43] <Kidritch> it's crazy extensive
[2022-12-11 04:21:49] <+squimper> My worgen has arms. Blizzard didn't event arms, so they shouldn' give their characters arms.

[2022-12-11 04:21:54] <Lorehammer1988> imagine saying all first person shooters copied off of call of duty
[2022-12-11 04:21:56] <%Ghamera> Several lead WoW developers were raiders in Everquest, and even now Holly Longdale leads WoW, she had a long run at the top of Everquest leadership
[2022-12-11 04:21:56] <Kidritch> I think warhammer 40k has the most lore I've ever seen tho haha
[2022-12-11 04:21:58] <gautelo> It's not only about how long it is.. the girth matters as well! o.O

[2022-12-11 04:22:05] <shirvanas> And in the end, everything is Star Wars anyway
[2022-12-11 04:22:06] <+HawkKin> Should have elaborated. Didn't mean the whole game itself. Meant specific characters. Which is most from starcraft at least
[2022-12-11 04:22:11] <sleighher> Everquest was awesome
[2022-12-11 04:22:14] <%NaturalJoel> any english professor will tell you there are truly only five stories in the world
[2022-12-11 04:22:19] <%+emb1t> Why is this even a discussion? To be fair, if people hate that games take ideas from one another, then just stop playing games and go do something else in your life... where things work the same way btw. Quit being crybabies and just enjoy the fact that WoW seems fun again

[2022-12-11 04:23:04] <%+tanek1966> WoW and EQ2 released within two weeks of each other eighteen years ago. No one really gave WoW a chance, EQ was king at the time.
[2022-12-11 04:23:05] <%+emb1t> Honestly some of these people take it so seriously and it's just so du** :D

[2022-12-11 04:23:17] <+Ice0tope9> I just want end game content to do that is not farming stuff that doesnt matter in a week! M+ and raid can not come soon enough!
[2022-12-11 04:23:23] <Lorehammer1988> regardless of where wow came from on a personal note I love wow more then any of those that came before it and any that has been around sense
[2022-12-11 04:23:24] <+HawkKin> Which part are you enjoying more of current boomie? ST or AoE? @Naguura If you could only choose 1
[2022-12-11 04:23:32] <keibug19> You are amazing
[2022-12-11 04:23:34] <hughesbassangler> I‚Äôm not taking it seriously I just know  the facts
[2022-12-11 04:23:35] <+Slikey94> but i have to use spark

[2022-12-11 04:23:43] <+huntressdamo> why are people spamming the hunt
[2022-12-11 04:23:47] <+zebracak35> laughs in shadowpriest
[2022-12-11 04:23:50] <insaniity> laughs in Outlaw @Naguura
[2022-12-11 04:23:52] <+greemteam> @huntressdamo probably rep
[2022-12-11 04:23:55] <druinors> ST
[2022-12-11 04:23:59] <%+ZiefGaming> Thats why i love frost mage so much cleave baked into the ST rotation
[2022-12-11 04:23:59] <%PrincessCalliope> I prefer shadow priest single target
[2022-12-11 04:23:59] <+Grrezy> AoE
[2022-12-11 04:24:01] <insaniity> aoe :)
[2022-12-11 04:24:04] <+zebracak35> shadow priest aoe is one button
[2022-12-11 04:24:07] <%forde_x861> ST
[2022-12-11 04:24:09] <hughesbassangler> I remember seeing flags in EverQuest years ago that looked like a horde flag and this is way before wow even came out
[2022-12-11 04:24:09] <Shinybobblehead> Single target
[2022-12-11 04:24:09] <+SeanYeezy> I play a feral druid so I'd rather do AOE always
[2022-12-11 04:24:10] <+nowshido> Well... I play Monk so AoE
[2022-12-11 04:24:10] <%2000ish> aoe, i want my screen FILLED with numbers NODDERS
[2022-12-11 04:24:11] <itskyka> multiple targets
[2022-12-11 04:24:11] <hughesbassangler> I knew
[2022-12-11 04:24:12] <+alianduine> Single target
[2022-12-11 04:24:15] <shirvanas> SP
[2022-12-11 04:24:15] <+Phant0mCrash> most of the time multi target is boring and mind numbing I like single target fights
[2022-12-11 04:24:17] <+HawkKin> In BfA I enjoyed ST a lot more than whatever boomie AoE was called
[2022-12-11 04:24:18] <+gymwowlaundry> Single target
[2022-12-11 04:24:18] <keibug19> Multiple targets, and you are amazing
[2022-12-11 04:24:21] <itskyka> aoe but I'm also frost mage
[2022-12-11 04:24:21] <CeroEnBlanco> Single is more relaxed i like it more
[2022-12-11 04:24:22] <%+emb1t> I play evoker, so Multi target, cause the single target is kinda clunky
[2022-12-11 04:24:22] <%+Utter1993> Depends on the other mechanics surrounding it
[2022-12-11 04:24:22] <+Slikey94> rather get a d√∂ner in 10 min
[2022-12-11 04:24:24] <Lorehammer1988> I like single target more, with mechanics
[2022-12-11 04:24:27] <+Astxa> Hello!!
[2022-12-11 04:24:28] <%+Sebleh> seblehDinkdonk seblehDinkdonk seblehDinkdonk seblehDinkdonk seblehDinkdonk
[2022-12-11 04:24:29] <+Phant0mCrash> shiny doesn't mean better Naguura
[2022-12-11 04:24:29] <capitalccg> So for those that are saying wow ripped off EverQuest Warcraft 1 came out 5 years before EverQuest
[2022-12-11 04:24:34] <%+kyrafyrewind> Multiple. All that yellow is just satisfying.
[2022-12-11 04:24:34] <%+ZiefGaming> @Naguura  5 min of ST 5 min of AOE
[2022-12-11 04:24:37] <insaniity> as an m+ andy you'd know where my dopamine comes from KEKW @Naguura
[2022-12-11 04:24:40] <+vapes79> i prefer nuclear scale aoe
[2022-12-11 04:24:40] <+zebracak35> shadowpriest aoe rotation is dog water
[2022-12-11 04:24:45] <druinors> aoe is just padding most of the time
[2022-12-11 04:24:45] <+Ice0tope9> Depends tbh.
[2022-12-11 04:24:46] <shirvanas> tunnel vision
[2022-12-11 04:24:46] <Lorehammer1988> I build my toons for single targets, I feel thats "true" dps
[2022-12-11 04:24:49] [Notification] Woothdye subscribed at Tier 1.
[2022-12-11 04:24:52] <Airwavve> Hows the jet lag?
[2022-12-11 04:24:53] <+gymwowlaundry> I‚Äôd rather more boss strategy and less number padding
[2022-12-11 04:24:54] <Lorehammer1988> anyone can do 40k on aoe
[2022-12-11 04:24:56] <+Titocurl> @Naguura Lost Arc is a bunch of AoE so it can get repatative too
[2022-12-11 04:24:57] <codynickerson> Love the sweater
[2022-12-11 04:24:59] <+HawkKin> Streaking stars was a fun mechanic. Similar to monk mastery. Azerite sucked. But the mechanic of streaking stars I found fun
[2022-12-11 04:24:59] <@%SquirrelPowa> I'm leaning more towards ST or like 2-3 target cleave
[2022-12-11 04:24:59] <+eric__tyler> I feel like single target numbers are bigger. Seems more impactful.
[2022-12-11 04:25:08] <+Slikey94> st is less chaotic, aoe is kinda exhausting
[2022-12-11 04:25:12] <+vrajap> Probably depends more on the rotation than the numbers
[2022-12-11 04:25:14] <@%SquirrelPowa> As soon as it's over 6 targets for Enhance you're just sad LUL
[2022-12-11 04:25:17] <+Phant0mCrash> most aoe fights can turn into padding
[2022-12-11 04:25:18] <substancexdd> I mean yeah honestly WoW has been around for a WHILE and so considering that it's pretty original
[2022-12-11 04:25:20] <+Phant0mCrash> and no not really
[2022-12-11 04:25:20] <+nowshido> like the padding lol
[2022-12-11 04:25:39] <%+Sebleh> It def does. I like big numbers. AoE makes my DPS look thicc
[2022-12-11 04:25:39] <@%^StreamElements> naguuraW naguuraKhadgar naguuraW
[2022-12-11 04:25:40] <+Titocurl> @Naguura have you seen ZenithVR? Its a VR-MMO
[2022-12-11 04:25:40] <+vrajap> ST rotation can be better than AOE then I would prefer ST
[2022-12-11 04:25:42] <%heavanna> Totally depends on the class I'm playing.
[2022-12-11 04:25:50] <+nowshido> oh
[2022-12-11 04:25:50] <+Ice0tope9> Like as fire mage aoe rotation = not fun so ST on fire.
[2022-12-11 04:25:54] <%+Sebleh> seblehDinkdonk @Kuroz seblehDinkdonk
[2022-12-11 04:25:56] <+greemteam> @capitalccg wow lore comes from the warcraft games. the warcraft game was initially supposed to be warhammer, but that fell through.  wow as a game is just an iteration of everquest.  vanilla wow was everquest but on rails. everquest was much more dangerous and more of sandbox
[2022-12-11 04:26:02] <+gymwowlaundry> If the adds have a mechanic then awesome but big numbers isn‚Äôt fun for me just my opinion
[2022-12-11 04:26:05] <@%Kuroz> seblehNotes @Sebleh
[2022-12-11 04:26:06] <sleighher> I think the game has become easier to play and level
[2022-12-11 04:26:10] <hughesbassangler> Yeah true but the thing is Warcraft was like a Dota so doesn‚Äôt matter Warcraft formed into WOW after EverQuest came out
[2022-12-11 04:26:19] <%+Sebleh> @Kuroz Good morning sunshine.
[2022-12-11 04:26:21] <+Phant0mCrash> I don't know of any raid fights were you are hitting 10 targets the entire time and it not be padding
[2022-12-11 04:26:26] <%+ZiefGaming> I love a good mixture this raid seems amazing for both so it will compliment alot of classes that usually arent
[2022-12-11 04:26:31] <%+Sebleh> Ew what is this dumb prime badge gtfo
[2022-12-11 04:26:32] <+Ice0tope9> But bigger number do be better.
[2022-12-11 04:26:40] <+tryhaardtv> the objective in the game is to make a tank pull t he most amount of targets then achieve the highest possible number in details
[2022-12-11 04:26:43] <+tryhaardtv> KEKW
[2022-12-11 04:26:43] <hughesbassangler> U play ever quest feels like a old school wow game it‚Äôs crazy how similar the ideas are
[2022-12-11 04:26:44] <%Sebleh> Better now I think seblehNotes
[2022-12-11 04:26:47] <+Phant0mCrash> hey your words lol
[2022-12-11 04:26:48] <%warryvibe> @Sebleh naguuraOMEGALUL
[2022-12-11 04:27:03] <+Hellm0uth> I do a ton of AoE as arcane mage in world and dungeons when needed on trash
[2022-12-11 04:27:05] <%Sebleh> Imagine this target Naguura worryAss
[2022-12-11 04:27:07] <+Titocurl> As both a Pally Tank and a lock I like multi targets. Makes me feel like I need to pay attention to the game more
[2022-12-11 04:27:10] <%warryvibe> worryAss
[2022-12-11 04:27:15] <+Phant0mCrash> its pronounced patchwork lol
[2022-12-11 04:27:18] <corruptedgg> my brain hurts
[2022-12-11 04:27:21] <corruptedgg> this is to much
[2022-12-11 04:27:22] <Grimmnoth> as a fire ele sham, aoe is more fun cause youre a lava surge monster
[2022-12-11 04:27:23] <+HawkKin> Did you ever play affli and/or destro lock in mop?
[2022-12-11 04:27:25] <%exterminans72> N A G U U R A !!!    You are the most beautiful woman in the world, i love u ;)
[2022-12-11 04:27:25] <+gymwowlaundry> I pick single target and that‚Äôs why I play a mage ;)
[2022-12-11 04:27:29] <Lorehammer1988> ah ok so youre talking about 4 bosses that share life vs 1 boss with big health?
[2022-12-11 04:27:38] <mateojr007> lol\
[2022-12-11 04:27:41] <corruptedgg> i only press starfall
[2022-12-11 04:27:42] <%NaturalJoel> simultaneous 10 boss fight would be awesome
[2022-12-11 04:27:45] <Lorehammer1988> in that case yes I like multi better bc if feels faster
[2022-12-11 04:27:45] <+Grrezy> AoE but it depends on the class.
[2022-12-11 04:27:47] <%+Merg1802> For a class that is good at AoE yes that is more fun,
[2022-12-11 04:27:54] <Lorehammer1988> sorry 10* :)
[2022-12-11 04:27:54] <jeshim> LUL

[2022-12-11 04:28:06] <%+ftwfishie> depends on how much execute time LuL
[2022-12-11 04:28:09] <hughesbassangler> AOE depends on the class period

[2022-12-11 04:28:11] <%warryvibe> Deadge
[2022-12-11 04:28:11] <+blashy23> depends on the spec so my lock has average aoe but i prefer single cause the rotation is more fun for me

[2022-12-11 05:52:37] <%Sebleh> I do find it a bit hard to understand sometimes *WHY* some talents are stronger than others, but determining the "strong" talents isn't too difficult IMO.
[2022-12-11 05:52:48] <%Sebleh> Well not "why" but rather "how much"
[2022-12-11 05:53:20] <eadric_horde> Like a Prot paladin playing Blessing of Protection in a Mythic+ that is 90% magic damage. Spellwarding is the better pick
[2022-12-11 05:53:31] <%BahumutGold> Right, like Trailblazer for Hunter... most guides will say that it's a terrible talent, since you should *always* be shooting as a hunter, but SL had a  number of encounters where it was *really good*
[2022-12-11 05:53:59] <MrCherryUSA> basically 372 :O

[2022-12-11 05:54:34] <+natureschoosing> @Naguura Is there an addon or WA that shows the location of the rares that drop the good items?
[2022-12-11 05:55:04] <%OxxyOG> HIII!
[2022-12-11 05:55:11] <%BahumutGold> Exactly
[2022-12-11 05:55:15] <+dubhudz> i feel that
[2022-12-11 05:55:17] <+dubhudz> lol
[2022-12-11 05:55:23] <%Sebleh> I feel like Blizzard felt the freedom to put the current talent trees in with the knowledge that Wowhead and the class discords would tell people how to build them up.
[2022-12-11 05:55:30] <+rime_covered_mace> i always just do passive talents.. im not that good lol
[2022-12-11 05:55:45] <%BahumutGold> I'll take 90% damage that allows me to focus on the fight more.
[2022-12-11 05:55:50] <SantanaJones33> Naguura is by far the best content creator for WoW
[2022-12-11 05:55:53] <%Sebleh> YEP Kyrian
[2022-12-11 05:56:08] <+Ghostauren> I am playing with a lizard evoker now KomodoHype KomodoHype KomodoHype

[2022-12-11 05:56:34] <Gilfynavota72527> @ghostauren how is evoker as the class?
[2022-12-11 05:56:45] <%OxxyOG> Doing well! itching for Tuesday reset!! AHH
[2022-12-11 05:56:50] <+TheAngryIntern> or just be like me and try to take as many passive talents as possible
[2022-12-11 05:56:57] <carbonzo_bean> is there an example of the implementation of this mindset
[2022-12-11 05:56:58] <+Ghostauren> @Gilfynavota72527 I think it is nice. Besides I love the race of Drakthyr

[2022-12-11 06:01:11] <+kirkusmantis> Totally agree. If your metric markers is 1000 damage a minute 100% of the time is better than 1200 damage 60% of the time.
