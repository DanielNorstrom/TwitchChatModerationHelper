[2022-12-27 17:45:33] <%moosenukl> wake up before  , then take caffeine
[2022-12-27 17:45:34] <Abel_Jo> thats the new time im hearing too Hmmm
[2022-12-27 17:45:34] <%+highplainsdrifter> yeah 90 mins is what the current thinking on it is now. It avoids the crash later, they say
[2022-12-27 17:45:36] <%Deezil_Wood> LOL soon as a wake up I gotta have a smoke and a Monster LUL
[2022-12-27 17:45:36] <shootable> I have caffeine 5 minutes after I wake up

[2022-12-27 17:45:40] <+BeefBraum> gotta let the nicotine settle for 90 minutes before caffiene intake
[2022-12-27 17:45:41] <%steppscav> full glass of water prior to caffeine will give you a better bowel movement
[2022-12-27 17:45:42] <+XampleMAN> Are green flares working chat?

[2022-12-27 18:19:09] <%+kingbob151> I don’t think most new players understand to level most these skills you just gotta play
[2022-12-27 18:19:11] <%XeuUK> Since prewipe events started 99% of my kills are mutant/rd gamers sadge
[2022-12-27 18:19:12] <+BranFlakes4> I mean, I run meta now because I can afford meta now when it only costs a ruble or two KEKW
[2022-12-27 18:19:16] <%DrMantisTBaggin> Need a skill rework. Allow people to spend points to increase skills when you level. Get rid of the cheese methods and time wasting outside the gameloop to increaase skills

[2022-12-27 18:22:04] <DrLector> @DrMantisTBaggin feel like the skill leveling event painfully underlines the problem when the skills that level fast don't have a purpose or have a useless elite skill, and those that are relevant STILL take ages to level

[2022-12-27 21:10:43] <%+yomabloodd> if the area doesnt have a comitment from severakl residents to get fiber, comcast not gonna spend money on setting an infraestructure for one guy, and even then it takes a while before is all setup cause you need to call in for locates, permits and get the bore crews lined up, then the crews setup up the nodes and pulling fiber through, and then you need splicers, ultimately comes the cable guy to hook you up

[2022-12-27 21:20:57] <%0MaG> @willerz I’ve been through 8-9 wipes, always push quests up to lv40 then branch out to whatever I feel like doing. Do you think just running good raids is a good way to level versus pushing quests exclusively?
[2022-12-27 21:21:03] <+linglingherrro> so make it more difficult to have fun in a video game?
[2022-12-27 21:21:04] <SirOnyxTDK> I agree. as a casual I'd rather them not be everywhere non stop

[2022-12-27 21:21:20] <johngjohn> the grips and stocks should be only fir

[2022-12-27 21:21:38] <sicoofye> really great idea
[2022-12-27 21:21:38] <+turdburgler3000> Streamers making suggestions like this is why the game sucked for 90% of the player base
[2022-12-27 21:21:40] <%TSvassilev> @barz___ use more "stockish" guns
[2022-12-27 21:21:43] <%+BoT_sLoThy> and maybe there's an in-game trader in a very high-risk area that has those parts
[2022-12-27 21:21:46] <2stepingsupra> Can you run a raid with a p90?
[2022-12-27 21:21:49] <25Logan25> i like that idea tbh

[2022-12-27 21:21:55] <+MunkE8> I like that but also the gun is hard to get
[2022-12-27 21:21:57] <%drifter_dave> yeah I want them to flesh out more of the survival/looting stuff like that
[2022-12-27 21:21:59] <Mad_FireTV> I 100% agree with that… should have to find meta ammo also
[2022-12-27 21:21:59] <+steezisam> that would be boring, you dont get to run high end loadouts whenever you want
[2022-12-27 21:22:00] <DankBizzer> dope idea for sure
[2022-12-27 21:22:00] <%SudzzQT> that would make ppl more scared to fight
[2022-12-27 21:22:01] <+KnightOfAmarCostume> @sir_kipzy depends what u mean with loot. rng shouldnt be how u get them just by looting rando stuff
[2022-12-27 21:22:04] <S_mea_R> It's time to make Tarkov, actually Tarkov. Let's stop beating around the bush and make it brutal. Dudes just demolishing each other over an RD spawn.
[2022-12-27 21:22:05] <+ANinjaBunny> for how much I like it too, I think game needs to lose flea for those reasons
[2022-12-27 21:22:06] <+barz___> @TSvassilev correct, but people will just horde them and use rfb and rd with zhukov
[2022-12-27 21:22:06] <%Reap3r1G> P90 Rocks

[2022-12-27 21:22:10] <%+godilovespaghetti> thats why early wipe is so fun. no flea to meta your guns, you got what you got
[2022-12-27 21:22:11] <%+pinishnogood> P90 is so sick.
[2022-12-27 21:22:13] <%+LLarryy_> then timmys never have good parts, and chads already have those insane parts stored in their stash?

[2022-12-27 23:14:21] <AndreiNego> made me log in for this. aliens can exist just as we do but this is very unlikely. the problem is space and time. highly advanced civilizations can exist in the timeframe of the universe just not contemporary to us.  we exist for less than 1 million years with a civilization that is barely 10.000 years old.  if the universe dies at hour 24, we live around hour 2 meaning that we are earlier than 80% of civilizations.  even if there are billions we still might miss them by a few million years

[2022-12-27 23:19:39] <%AndreiNego> @JohnDCarl of course, but the problem is again space since the universe is so big, only a tiny amount is suitable for life. compare the size of our planet to the size of the solar system and then to the nearby empty space around it. this is so infinitely small that it's basically within an error sample. the assumption is that 100% of civilizations will exist within the age of the universe and in the space of the universe. we can't be the 100% but we have a nearly 100% chance of never meeting any

[2022-12-27 23:23:16] <%AndreiNego> @DonkeShow take a walk on a big lake. pick 10 rocks and throw them one after the other in the lake. the catch, you throw the first when you arrive, the last when you leave, and the rest while circling the lake. if any ripples from two stones meet you can consider two alien civs meet
[2022-12-27 23:23:17] <@%+Gamer_Advantage> tomorrow is gonna be bustin'
