[2022-12-10 00:35:40] <ploki122> @shirotihsaka It's pretty much a choice of single target vs clear. You usually don't need much single in campaign, so I would 4L RF...

[2022-12-10 00:37:43] <mauser1911> hard for something not to feel better than archnem @jusstin1
[2022-12-10 00:37:52] <RueTobas1> The rares are really nice when you have vaal cleave KEKW
[2022-12-10 00:37:58] <%Fepni> it feels exactly the same to me lol

[2022-12-10 00:41:14] <okijhnub> @RueTobas1 Can you use vaal cleave as a secondary skill just to steal the buffs and use anohter skill?
[2022-12-10 00:41:14] <ploki122> shroud playing PoE is a weird one though

[2022-12-10 00:41:34] <ploki122> I think saying we have 95% of Ziz' viewer is a better metric.

[2022-12-10 01:02:21] <mauser1911> fun > rewards tbh
[2022-12-10 01:02:27] <MildMandy> i tend to ignore league mechanics until i get to maps
[2022-12-10 01:02:29] <Gravel86> Well look at it this way Phox, how many other leagues have you played that have been less rewarding? or are you just skipping?
[2022-12-10 01:02:54] <jordzkie05> whoever says earlier that x multi chrom orbs not showing in loot filter, filter detected x3 chrom orbs.
[2022-12-10 01:03:07] <MercerWing> yeah you definitely need more ms for this
[2022-12-10 01:03:09] <Gravel86> ah ok
[2022-12-10 01:03:13] <ploki122> @Gravel86 It's just a weird mechanic for RF... so just skipping more than usual
[2022-12-10 01:03:14] <%+RustyPcGaming> you can't expect someone to do league mechanic when your rocking 3-4Ls with white/blue items
[2022-12-10 01:04:01] <RueTobas1> You got pyre so may as well get aoe
[2022-12-10 01:04:07] <caracachimba> how is the league? can this build do legion and breach well?
[2022-12-10 01:04:11] <+mammaries1> @Gravel86 yea. definitely not ideal. brands or totems are best for mechanic
[2022-12-10 01:04:15] <Gravel86> yeah fair seems like a totem league
[2022-12-10 01:04:19] <%+RustyPcGaming> early pyre does that
[2022-12-10 01:04:21] <gomok111> this is the basic aoe?
[2022-12-10 01:04:23] <Splashfire> @caracachimba no rf sucks for legion
[2022-12-10 01:04:51] <mauser1911> did we not get an explode flask added?
[2022-12-10 01:04:54] <typinghazard> harvest was ok during acts just bc it made gearing dead simple, but pohx is right, in acts you're just trying to get out of acts lol
[2022-12-10 01:04:54] <@^StreamElements> I've setup a Nexus Game Store --> https://www.nexus.gg/Pohx You can find games I've played through & Recommend here!

[2022-12-10 01:05:06] <%+trigger3531> @Pohx do you use magma early because you just like it better?
[2022-12-10 01:05:25] <%+trigger3531> Righteous homie thank you
[2022-12-10 01:05:31] <@%lemoncoolers> rolling magma is the highest flat damage spell in the game
[2022-12-10 01:05:33] <+pigsofair> is fire damage better than burning damage?
[2022-12-10 01:05:34] <+shad0w_wa1ker> izaro melting like buttaer
[2022-12-10 01:05:37] <caracachimba> whats a godid strter for legin and breach?
[2022-12-10 01:05:46] <typinghazard> if I could aim I'd play rolling magma lol
[2022-12-10 01:05:49] <+Laszerous> i like the rolling magma leveling, i tossed in a holy relic so i dont get lonely
[2022-12-10 01:05:59] <AeroFantasia> Is Pohx the Righteous Father?
[2022-12-10 01:06:00] <hottunas> break time
[2022-12-10 01:06:01] <Hillgrove> build is decent league starter... just need aegis, melding, explode flask and bottled faith.
[2022-12-10 01:06:01] <+mammaries1> @pigsofair depends on how much of each you have. probably burning rn, but hard to say without knowing your gear

[2022-12-10 01:07:01] <legendeur> @Hillgrove dont forget a juiced elder helmet YEP
[2022-12-10 01:07:10] <DejavuNeony> WTF poe crashed and steam is updating it BLUBBERSWTF
[2022-12-10 01:07:13] <legendeur> @Hillgrove
[2022-12-10 01:07:14] <Splashfire> fire is better than burning because you have more fire damage on tree
[2022-12-10 01:07:36] <+Goodkall> @MyPurpleBottle vaal rf has always been part of the build what are you talking about
[2022-12-10 01:07:38] <+Trophyman10> is this a new rf mtx? i dont think ive ever seen it
[2022-12-10 01:07:46] <Hillgrove> @legendeur how could I forget :D
[2022-12-10 01:07:50] <+Trophyman10> also havent played in a ffew leagues
[2022-12-10 01:07:54] <+Derpiino> does RF feels fun to play ? seems weird not using a skill
[2022-12-10 01:08:13] <Splashfire> but doesnt "more fire damage" scale your increased fire damage and not your increased burning damage? Hmm
[2022-12-10 01:08:18] <Strollein> I want GGG to add a vaal fire trap skill
[2022-12-10 01:08:30] <+DonGiovanniEUW> @Derpiino How will you know for yourself if you don't play it? cohhLUL
[2022-12-10 01:08:33] <%+RustyPcGaming> If you get wrist pain then RF is the best skill in the game
[2022-12-10 01:08:33] <%+Malifiecent> Scepters are the Wands for GIGACHADS
[2022-12-10 01:08:33] <Splashfire> dmg scaling is too complicated lol
[2022-12-10 01:08:50] <+Derpiino> @DonGiovanniEUW that is a good point indeed
[2022-12-10 01:08:51] <+z0mbie_cat> they are lumped together, you can see it in PoB
[2022-12-10 01:08:59] <%+RustyPcGaming> If you want to press 2 buttons then RF is also the best skill
[2022-12-10 01:09:08] <ZestyCow> Hydration check chat
[2022-12-10 01:09:12] <+Derpiino> yo the AOE is good now

[2022-12-10 01:09:29] <Harbio4> @Pohx can we do leauge mechanic at all?

[2022-12-10 01:35:12] <+Goatausorus> @Pohx  VAAL IT
[2022-12-10 01:35:18] <+redlucky> or just use a Drilling machine
[2022-12-10 01:35:18] <MercerWing> but sure try it
[2022-12-10 01:35:23] <%Haxel96> it sinking = it has water in it
[2022-12-10 01:35:24] <%Haxel96> so yes
[2022-12-10 01:35:31] <%howitczar> it probably needs to be kinda sealed off so the pressure isn't equal
[2022-12-10 01:35:32] <%Haxel96> good sign
[2022-12-10 01:35:33] <Beef682> rooWut
[2022-12-10 01:35:36] <%+FatRat_> Ok my testing is concluded, the bottle has to be sealed for the water to get sucked up through the filter KEKW
[2022-12-10 01:35:41] <%+FatRat_> It just made a whistling noise
[2022-12-10 01:35:43] <%+Liyanx> In case it doesn't work just destroy the thing and put the stuff in the water
[2022-12-10 01:35:43] <BillGPlays> that cap also fits on nalgene and hydroflask bottles
[2022-12-10 01:35:46] <Evylrune> the multitasking is real

[2022-12-10 01:36:16] <%MrMarchMallow> you got some tape lol?
[2022-12-10 01:36:20] <%+FatRat_> You gotta get the right bottle I think, you prob cant get it sealed otherwise LUL
[2022-12-10 01:36:20] <%EU_This_NA_That> I dont know what is happening, streamer is just complaining that nothing is coming out and it's bubbling? HUH

[2022-12-10 01:36:29] <MercerWing> can it fit a standard pet bottle? it looked thin
[2022-12-10 01:36:36] <+bamorgan13> plastic wrap the top?
[2022-12-10 01:36:38] <+shad0w_wa1ker> get a knife
[2022-12-10 01:36:41] <+shad0w_wa1ker> an stab it
[2022-12-10 01:36:54] <%+FatRat_> Fission is awful in terms of how they package the product, it totally could be a refillable tube
[2022-12-10 01:36:56] <AleisterSnake> You have to make it so the straw is sealing the bottle, so you have to use duct tape or something
[2022-12-10 01:37:01] <%+Liyanx> Get a spoon and stab it
[2022-12-10 01:37:04] <Gunch73> look up cirkul filter photo
[2022-12-10 01:37:05] <%+FatRat_> but instead each one is separate, so much plastic

[2022-12-10 01:37:26] <jusjig> so no air can go out
[2022-12-10 01:37:26] <%+MyPurpleBottle> actually you can make it, you just need bottle a little thinner
[2022-12-10 01:37:29] <BillGPlays> get another bottle! nalgene camelbak hydroflask etc
[2022-12-10 01:37:30] <+shad0w_wa1ker> try to twist teh top or somethign

[2022-12-10 01:57:36] <+MrMcFeely> Bruh. I just started leveling the RF jugg and dropped a tabula rasa in act 1.
[2022-12-10 01:57:39] <+gayaa2081> The moves in santum are pretty slow

[2022-12-10 01:57:45] <niceplayer69> problem is each hit you take takes resolve away
[2022-12-10 01:57:50] <niceplayer69> so you cant even tank normal mobs
[2022-12-10 01:57:52] <%Arykaas> Mobility is definitely king in Sanctums.
[2022-12-10 01:58:00] <%NariNarwhals> @Haxel96 me and a mate duo it alot. its fun little grindy map to zone out to
[2022-12-10 01:58:06] <+shad0w_wa1ker> what do you call a well balanced horse
[2022-12-10 01:58:09] <niceplayer69> yes, but other builds dont need to get close
[2022-12-10 01:58:15] <blezzt> IM LVL 51 jugg rf and doing every sanctum and its realy easy
[2022-12-10 01:58:16] <%+MrSparkalou1> definutky makes evasion for mechanic way better then armour
[2022-12-10 01:58:17] <legendeur> you wont "facetank" normal mobs as rf if they die before they reach you YEP
[2022-12-10 01:58:19] <%NariNarwhals> DO chad builds
[2022-12-10 01:58:19] <%+Isshan> use a pet build or totem build if you want to do well

[2022-12-10 01:59:00] <AbracadAbraxas> you supposedly take less resolve damage if you are closer
[2022-12-10 01:59:06] <%Arykaas> eh less people playing RF means RF stuff is cheaper Kappa

[2022-12-10 01:59:34] <+Nenkaura> so strange. almost like you get crazy life regen, defense, sit on people, and burn em to death
[2022-12-10 02:00:02] <%NariNarwhals> @Arykaas more expensive PepeLaugh

[2022-12-10 02:38:55] <CormackYYC> does effects that prevent your movement speed from being reduced below base work for sanctum mechanics?

[2022-12-10 02:57:13] <+MaybeRespect> Good to hear. Hope you enjoy it long term :)

[2022-12-10 02:57:41] <+Etainz> with curse changes are we doing self cast now?
[2022-12-10 02:57:50] <%+acuteinsomniac> wtf you actually have to STEP over the coins in sanctum
[2022-12-10 02:58:02] <+MuringaTV1> i cant import the POB link
[2022-12-10 02:58:19] <+gotrix86> u have community fork?
[2022-12-10 02:58:37] <everseenttv> is the lag the reason you dont play hardcore anymore?
[2022-12-10 02:59:00] <KosunaKoizumi> Got Tabula in Act 4, should I 6-link RF?
[2022-12-10 02:59:14] <+gotrix86> or fire trap
[2022-12-10 02:59:41] <everseenttv> that's definitely a mature outlook hahah. im debating going SCSSF instead of HC
[2022-12-10 02:59:47] <%pandamoanium0> inspiration maybe ?
[2022-12-10 02:59:52] <+shad0w_wa1ker> extra buffer for resolve
[2022-12-10 02:59:53] <@%GingerPommy> i have mad respect for people who play hc because anyone who can spend 100 hours and then lose it all to 1 death and just start another character are insane
[2022-12-10 03:00:05] <+ChillNeo> Myself, I’m too poor a player to play HC. Lose too many characters.
[2022-12-10 03:00:06] <+goosfraba121> inspiration is a shield
[2022-12-10 03:00:11] <+goosfraba121> for ur resolve.. ES essentially
[2022-12-10 03:00:14] <+gotrix86> or do ssf vanilla like me. I don't buy gear but I sell gear to craft my own... I enjoy that a lot haha
[2022-12-10 03:00:18] <+MaybeRespect> I can't do SSF since I really don't play enough to understand crafting and what not fully.

[2022-12-10 03:00:44] <sterophone> i just bought 200 inspiration each floor from merchant
[2022-12-10 03:01:17] <everseenttv> I really like the challenge of SSF, ot
[2022-12-10 03:01:20] <sterophone> yup, earlier i boughht 60% more movement speed
[2022-12-10 03:01:22] <warchiefbruiser> im rf jugg in hcssf lvl 50 and its not easy since im not experienced with it
[2022-12-10 03:01:24] <everseenttv> it's not for everyone haha

[2022-12-10 03:01:53] <+UndeadZX> just got a +1 fire scepter from hargan
[2022-12-10 03:01:56] <Yukiyuki_> first out of map mechanic in a while
[2022-12-10 03:02:03] <%+Liyanx> No
[2022-12-10 03:02:04] <everseenttv> im about to do first lab on the RF Jugg it's a fun first experience
[2022-12-10 03:02:04] <%+etfnord> no
[2022-12-10 03:02:06] <+goosfraba121> i would like it more if it didnt require me to run maps / zones to get new flors.
[2022-12-10 03:02:06] <%Cyberrazzer99> The best thing is that you don't loose your inventory when you die during a longer run
[2022-12-10 03:02:07] <%+etfnord> it works in campaign
[2022-12-10 03:02:08] <%+Liyanx> There is a button
[2022-12-10 03:02:09] <+duranggo> you can always save
[2022-12-10 03:02:10] <AeroFantasia> You can do it already
[2022-12-10 03:02:10] <+goosfraba121> you can save up to 8 rooms
[2022-12-10 03:02:13] <%kjlhs> every time you get to see the room you can store it
[2022-12-10 03:02:14] <AeroFantasia> Its the scroll button
[2022-12-10 03:02:20] <%kjlhs> theres a button bottom left i think
[2022-12-10 03:02:24] <+gotrix86> oh shit... I didn't see a button so far haha
[2022-12-10 03:02:24] <+duranggo> bottom left on map
[2022-12-10 03:02:31] <crez3003> there is a button that allows you to store up to 8 sanctum runs
[2022-12-10 03:02:44] <+gotrix86> that's good. I was worried about that a lot
[2022-12-10 03:02:47] <%+Liyanx> careful there is a reset button beside it
[2022-12-10 03:02:47] <+Safirra89> lol leveling with rolling magma was rough
[2022-12-10 03:02:51] <%machmalangsam> the game doesnt explain it very well though
[2022-12-10 03:02:53] <%+Sup3r_Tr4mp> how it feel so far?
[2022-12-10 03:02:57] <%machmalangsam> alot of trial and error
[2022-12-10 03:03:01] <+goosfraba121> @Safirra89 i suggest holy fire totem.

[2022-12-10 03:04:06] <AeroFantasia> Rolling magma is giga weak unless you properly craft your wands. when you proberly craft your wand rolling magma is GIGAstronk

[2022-12-10 03:24:08] <+Badd_Boi> They are slightly less tanky, but waaaay less rippy
[2022-12-10 03:24:08] <oLaudix> blue mobs feel weaker but yellow mobs still feel like sponges
[2022-12-10 03:24:08] <%Haxel96> the mods are a bit simpler now but otherwise yeah
[2022-12-10 03:24:12] <crez3003> they feel slightly lower HP but otherwise the same to me
[2022-12-10 03:24:15] <+shad0w_wa1ker> just renamed and the loot drops are randomized

[2022-12-10 03:24:29] <%ryenard> well the combinations of mods are different

[2022-12-10 03:24:38] <Commander_HK47> it feels better
[2022-12-10 03:24:53] <+ovozeke> i think it's moreso you won't get a mega tank 4-5 mod archnem anymore
[2022-12-10 03:24:55] <arof> But something will have a specific mod set and take 10x less damage from me and take forever to die

[2022-12-10 03:25:54] <AeroFantasia> Your way less likely to run into those uber tanky archnems and if you do their damage output wont be super rippy is what I've found.
[2022-12-10 03:25:57] <arof> Like I was crit spells and something had two mods that just spelled out it was resistant to my shit. So it was clear WHY it wasn't dying and I didn't have to know weird keywords
[2022-12-10 03:26:05] <arof> So in that regard it's way way better
[2022-12-10 03:26:16] <Hikakundesu> is league mechanic just for melee bulliyng?

[2022-12-10 03:28:20] <AeroFantasia> Taunt does work. It should be said that it doesn't matter if youre "melee or ranged" its rather. Are you close to the enemy or furhter away when it hits you that calculates the damage.

[2022-12-10 03:31:31] <oLaudix> you do not have 101 fire rez
[2022-12-10 03:31:34] <%Haxel96> or well, last league
[2022-12-10 03:31:41] <%sableflag> I think this might be the most fun leveling experience I've had
[2022-12-10 03:31:47] <%+anangryveteran> 140 life regen is not enough lol
[2022-12-10 03:31:50] <+shad0w_wa1ker> rez on the left not the right
[2022-12-10 03:31:53] <+shockspawn> exalts are more fun now, than divines were before
[2022-12-10 03:31:53] <eternaldevourer> Just want to say thank you for all quality content you put out Pohx, I've finally converted to the RF train despite not liking it back in the day I find myself enjoying it a lot more now. I was an Inquisitor last league now joining the Jugg train~
[2022-12-10 03:31:56] <funkittytv> can u show again were to check ?
[2022-12-10 03:32:00] <+hellosoyguga> press C

[2022-12-10 03:32:05] <+mammaries1> defenses tab
[2022-12-10 03:32:11] <funkittytv> its 75
[2022-12-10 03:32:13] <czystazsokiem> is not fun build for beginners XDD
[2022-12-10 03:32:17] <%Haxel96> @funkittytv should be 79
[2022-12-10 03:32:24] <@%lemoncoolers> @funkittytv needs to be 79. Copy the tree exactly.
[2022-12-10 03:32:32] <funkittytv> I do its yours lol :)) same passives
[2022-12-10 03:32:38] <kr3ster> i 100% disagree
[2022-12-10 03:32:40] <%Haxel96> @funkittytv cant be
[2022-12-10 03:32:42] <sterophone> u can play 75 fire res and cop the Springleaf shield and be fine
[2022-12-10 03:32:44] <+ovozeke> idk how but i am sustaining rf with 73% in leveling right now
[2022-12-10 03:32:45] <kr3ster> 100% great for newbs
[2022-12-10 03:32:47] <AbracadAbraxas> not for beginners KEKW
[2022-12-10 03:32:49] <Oct0_Pus> he could be just lower lvl
[2022-12-10 03:32:51] <+fr1d0m> im beginnier, and im blasting at act 7
[2022-12-10 03:32:58] <funkittytv> I dont say its not fun it is fun and good for begginers
[2022-12-10 03:32:58] <%+EmVe> This PoB is perfect for noobs
[2022-12-10 03:33:00] <groovygear> Did you chamge the tree progressive?
[2022-12-10 03:33:00] <Six_Two> you can not have the same passives and be at 75, with the same passives you are at 79
[2022-12-10 03:33:00] <%zeehappycamper> only second league can confirm he's correct LULW
[2022-12-10 03:33:02] <jermardapyanjil> Did you do the socket trick on your gloves?
[2022-12-10 03:33:04] <funkittytv> did the Lab
[2022-12-10 03:33:07] <Sarge_Dixon> @funkittytv are you using the 30-40 tree?
[2022-12-10 03:33:10] <+shad0w_wa1ker> pohx talking about reading while skipping a button cause it looks like reading lol
[2022-12-10 03:33:13] <%+hydemin_d> barbirism/prismatic skin get you plus max fire res. thats why mine wasnt working
[2022-12-10 03:33:13] <%machmalangsam> since the switch to rf this build is awesome. running thorugh campaign like never before
[2022-12-10 03:33:15] <+hellosoyguga> I play since legion but skipping some leagues, I think with just the pob I can get along fine already
[2022-12-10 03:33:15] <MorimichiOv> lvl 41 should be 79 fire res
[2022-12-10 03:33:16] <jordzkie05> i got RF activated at 35
[2022-12-10 03:33:17] <groovygear> progression?
[2022-12-10 03:33:17] <oLaudix> not for beginners? This build literaly needs almost 0 crafting knowledge
[2022-12-10 03:33:18] <+Xandorath> lower level or not enough fire res to get to 79
[2022-12-10 03:33:25] <funkittytv> I'm lvl 35 , yea maybe it could be vl 35-44 let me check
[2022-12-10 03:33:26] <Hereesh> Guys hes playing jugg right?
[2022-12-10 03:33:27] <crez3003> i played Pohx Inq and it was EASY as a beginer, and honestly Jugg is the same level of details if not even more so.. So if you cannot follow the PoB - Then you are being silly (no offense)
[2022-12-10 03:33:28] <@%lemoncoolers> @funkittytv you do not have prismatic skin or barbarism
[2022-12-10 03:33:28] <darkachid> frost wall is op for defence
[2022-12-10 03:33:30] <+fr1d0m> @Pohx maybe he didnt made jugg class yet :D
[2022-12-10 03:33:32] <%+badger3535> @funkittytv do you have barbarism and prismatic skin?

[2022-12-10 03:36:20] <+S0lst1ce> Still act tree prolly means no ascendency and without it even with golem and vit wont sustain
[2022-12-10 03:36:21] <Six_Two> for the amount of effort Pohx puts into these guides, the LEAST you can do is read the path of building, there is a Notes section aswell

[2022-12-10 05:14:49] <xplpex> does block prevent maybe resolution falling off?
[2022-12-10 05:14:57] <%+brizeno1> it is stupidly big so you never know until you see
[2022-12-10 05:14:58] <+shad0w_wa1ker> he was kinda off screen

[2022-12-10 05:15:37] <PoisonMushroom97> does sanctum get easier for RF? I'm struggling a bit

[2022-12-10 05:16:29] <Scarab911> you should kill that with stave first
[2022-12-10 05:16:41] <+Arkantoscream> are stats you want on gear generally the same for jugg as inq?
[2022-12-10 05:16:48] <+shad0w_wa1ker> its good to learn mechanics
[2022-12-10 05:17:17] <+breweryjake> Woah is the Identification effect on items new? I never noticed it before
[2022-12-10 05:17:23] <Porttrojan> never useless to be tanky imo
[2022-12-10 05:17:25] <$NoGoodNick_> it's a free modifier for everyone since noone is getting hit on a successful run
[2022-12-10 05:18:04] <%+Marotosfera> No hit sanctum run
[2022-12-10 05:18:20] <itboys8> is +1 to all fire gems better than added fire dmg?
[2022-12-10 05:18:23] <+Your_Favorite_Color> Resolve is cancer
[2022-12-10 05:18:31] <%+brizeno1> Your resolve should scale with your defense
[2022-12-10 05:18:36] <%+brizeno1> that would be the best
[2022-12-10 05:18:43] <+shad0w_wa1ker> ppl complaining about being tanky should look at minion builds
[2022-12-10 05:18:43] <%+83rdJesterPhil> @Pohx ever see path of maths league start bosser for 3.20? did you see how tanky it was?
[2022-12-10 05:18:48] <YaBoyDejavu> the 3rd floor becomes pure chaos at times with all those lasers sadCat

[2022-12-10 05:19:06] <@%GingerPommy> you should get punished for being squishy
[2022-12-10 05:19:08] <$NoGoodNick_> I hate the mechanic, I get off-screened sometimes; no way to see the "well telegraphed" attacks
[2022-12-10 05:19:26] <xplpex> if sanctum works with no damage its just the best league mechanic for glass cannon builds

[2022-12-10 05:26:50] <@%lemoncoolers> brutal shrine is only for hits
[2022-12-10 05:26:54] <@%lemoncoolers> since it also gives knockback

[2022-12-10 05:27:07] <KrazyStep> Does this build do decent at killing endgame bosses or is it still kinda a slog? havent played in about 3-4 leagues

[2022-12-10 05:40:53] <kr3ster> JUGG!!!!!!!
[2022-12-10 05:40:55] <TheCosmicAstro> leveling still feels a bit shoddy but thats just Path of Exile. but mannnn that RF swap feels so good

[2022-12-10 05:41:01] <wesen> With intense exertion during exercise, some of the excess hemoglobin released from the leaky red blood cells in the lungs is transported through the bronchi to the mouth. Once in our mouths, the iron molecules come in contact with receptors on the tongue that are sensitive to iron
[2022-12-10 05:41:03] <@%lemoncoolers> @GingerPommy im wholesome now I can't :)

[2022-12-10 05:42:59] <TheCosmicAstro> @its_kurse_ probably Jugg. it's a bit rough till get get to level 12 or so(first damage nodes) but you get to swap to RF way sooner and it's WAY tanky so you can just facetank most content
[2022-12-10 05:43:10] <asdyoloasd> you have to feel the weight of the coin man

[2022-12-10 06:25:22] <exiledpugilist> what's the state of vortex occ this league? it was my main starter
[2022-12-10 06:25:26] <+HuNgLiKeAnAzN> i miss doing a discharge witch. is it any good this patch?
[2022-12-10 06:25:38] <+xzobe> i am gonna ask a stupid question, how does the "traps" work, like i am putting them down but are they boosting my damage or just extra damage?

[2022-12-10 06:27:08] <legendeur> you need to do act 2 felshrine quest then for each fresh sanctum, you get asked to confirm your relics, you add it at that moment

[2022-12-10 15:33:33] <z1xt3r> definatelly a skill issue with people complaining about rolling magma, such a safe and easy skill to use
[2022-12-10 15:33:39] <Meganya> imagine leveling with bouncy lava sphere EleGiggle
[2022-12-10 15:33:50] <Hillgrove> @meetbunz rolling magma is a bit off untill you get better ignite chance... but it's not that bad. can use Holy Flame Totem and flame wall for non-bosses before that
[2022-12-10 15:33:53] <%+sealemons> @kruger2 no cause then they'd ask which one is better etc...

[2022-12-10 15:34:26] <NexaNTubing> I cleared till 40 with 2 link roling magma... the skill is op
[2022-12-10 15:34:29] <@%GingerPommy> i dont understand everyones issue with rolling magma, with the vendor weapons you one shot most packs
[2022-12-10 15:34:31] <+g722> pohx is already so generous with all the info that he has on his builds. I can't fathom anyone asking for more lmao
[2022-12-10 15:34:34] <@%GingerPommy> was super smooth for me
[2022-12-10 15:34:44] <Meganya> @emdahmani traps are not mines

[2022-12-10 15:35:08] <+stokim> most people who struggle with rolling magma dont make the weapons (not liking how the skill works is different)
[2022-12-10 15:35:11] <BhaluBear> Rolling magma legit felt I could do whole campaign on 2/3 link. Anyone that complains it’s bad almost for sure didn’t do vendor recipe
[2022-12-10 15:35:19] <SnowyGreyish> @emdahmani traps are triggered after a timer runs out or by coming in proximity to enemies

[2022-12-10 15:36:30] <%+sealemons> @bhalubear tbf you do have to aim in front of the enemy's to do more DMG with the skill and land it in a flame wall. there is a tiny skill gap with rolling magma for new players imo.
[2022-12-10 15:36:37] <%phlyntv> @palmermarc verify game files on steam?

[2022-12-10 17:44:49] <+thatONEjustin> I keep having it turn off despite showing full health, and I can't turn it back on again until I take a hit
[2022-12-10 17:44:51] <cmonBroh> it's tedious until around 35 when u convert to RF, after that it's cool

[2022-12-10 17:47:21] <@%lemoncoolers> @thatONEjustin it's not a bug. You are missing something.
[2022-12-10 17:47:22] <+squidbonk> Guy has Vaal RF?

[2022-12-10 17:47:30] <Sparked80> Flaak effect can remove RF
[2022-12-10 17:47:32] <%+kelisium> more than likely if you are disabling RF look at your flasks
[2022-12-10 17:47:34] <@%lemoncoolers> @thatONEjustin read your flasks very carefully.

[2022-12-10 17:47:35] <5hru88y> if your flask has dousing you are removing it on flask use
[2022-12-10 17:47:42] <fLipitZ> Also the CRTL alternate skills-- make sure youre not turning it off there
[2022-12-10 17:47:43] <+chud28> It turns off when you zone....
[2022-12-10 17:47:43] <%+Mouley17> probably remove burning on Flask!!
[2022-12-10 17:47:44] <%+palmermarc> It's 100% a flask that removes burning... lol
[2022-12-10 17:47:45] <ayy_was_gud> its flask remove burning
[2022-12-10 17:48:51] <riverlucastv> it turns off if you get to 1 hp right?
[2022-12-10 17:48:57] <overwpowered> READ the mods on your flasks
[2022-12-10 17:48:57] <TheCosmicAstro> @thatONEjustin check you dont have a flask that removes burning. that turns RF off
[2022-12-10 17:49:02] <fLipitZ> Yup- it also turns off after each zone
[2022-12-10 17:49:11] <Fieras_> it can be life or mana flask to clarify which can remove burning
[2022-12-10 17:49:12] <overwpowered> maybe one of the flasks disables it
[2022-12-10 17:49:18] <Psupp> imagine using remove burning flask

[2022-12-10 21:31:19] <StormFather__> I think the thing that's wild to me about Sanctum is that they keep saying "We don't like the current metas of offscreening and building so much dps you just one shot, rather than building defense to viably tank hits"
[2022-12-10 21:31:30] <radrain> what rf mtx is that
[2022-12-10 21:31:35] <StormFather__> But then they release league mechanics that heavily favor offscreening and never getting hit
[2022-12-10 21:31:40] <I_Am_Wisdom> what kill effect is the money i love that
[2022-12-10 21:32:19] <fLipitZ> So isnt that pretty much the league mechanic.. kill all without getting hit

[2022-12-10 21:32:29] <+neltin> sanctum finally became extremely easy me for now but it might becoming extremely dangerous again when I get into maps, idk, I bought a Baelfire spectra at lvl 60 & my 3L scorching ray began 1 sec killing every rare mob my lvl

[2022-12-10 21:34:34] <+neltin> I just use temp chains with the frost blank & walk behind every monster once, every unique mob dies in 1 - 3 secs of RF + scorching ray b4 they can even get off a second skill to hit me so I lose no resolve going through rooms, they're too slow with temp chains, I can also kill from distance with scorching now
[2022-12-10 21:34:46] <hazzqt> kill all @darkghostlord1

[2022-12-10 21:41:52] <gutold_fjutold> thats a good take
[2022-12-10 21:41:55] <%Fepni> i love the league mechanic but it absolutely favors builds that offscreen clear, but its not impossible in melee at all
[2022-12-10 21:42:10] <%+Tidez13> there isnt like a meta progression like w/ roguelites either
[2022-12-10 21:42:12] <+Boon_Raccoon> i'm playing oro flicker slayer and the guards die in a fraction of a second
[2022-12-10 21:42:14] <%+Tidez13> outside of the relics
[2022-12-10 21:42:17] <+neltin> I got a great boon finally lol, ignore the first damage to resolve taken in every room, now that I'm one shooting everything with scorching ray & RF and my build is quicker this actually isn't too bad
[2022-12-10 21:42:18] <+Boon_Raccoon> Shruge
[2022-12-10 21:42:21] <+DodyDortman> infernal cry feeeeels so good
[2022-12-10 21:42:22] <+Solomon_Kain> I think your build is your chatracter identity, the fact that it means nothing is really off-putting
[2022-12-10 21:42:24] <TheJuiceLight> I think what it needs is to have mitigation taken into account on how you lose time, no mitigation class cannon get hit? They done, high mitigation? Can get hit for ages

[2022-12-10 21:42:30] <+Alcsaar> which might be okay if relics dropped
[2022-12-10 21:42:35] <Shadowmiles93> Does your loot filter filter relics out?
[2022-12-10 21:42:44] <+neltin> I should've skipped all the sanctums I did early on in acts, it was terrible
[2022-12-10 21:42:56] <%+amren67> hey I just got a divine orb drop and just got into maps what do you recommend me to buy?
[2022-12-10 21:42:57] <Strollein> What they could do is somehow convert the character defences to the amount of resolve you get, that way tanky characters would have a benefit there
[2022-12-10 21:43:17] <%rbsc0> what is better to get first, lvl 21 RF or FT?

[2022-12-10 23:02:15] <+SIRMANITAS> my biggest complaint is that you cant take any damage at regardless of if your tanky or not because you lose resolve so randomly imo

[2022-12-10 23:20:22] <Bengista> How do bases work? Can I just pick any body armour with X iLvl so it can roll high lvl mods?
[2022-12-10 23:20:23] <CypherConjured> it's biased towards minion builds
[2022-12-10 23:20:25] <%+FatRat_> I'm gonna prob make an EA ballista char just for sanctum

[2022-12-10 23:20:43] <zanthren> EA Ballista is gonna be killer for sanctum
[2022-12-10 23:20:56] <%TheBestJoe> bases dictate the defensive stats and natural implicits
[2022-12-10 23:21:09] <+Etainz> base is Armor/ES/Evasion and maybe an implicit, ilvl are the mod tiers
[2022-12-10 23:21:11] <@%lemoncoolers> also certain bases can roll certain mods like only evasion or evasion/es bases can roll spell suppression

[2022-12-10 23:24:25] <%TheBestJoe> @Bengista one base is more desirable than another if its base stats are higher or the implicit modifiers synergize with your build better

[2022-12-10 23:24:51] <%akleosz> Pohx did you have any contact with Zeno in the past years? You know by chance what he is doing?

[2022-12-10 23:25:27] <Schua1500> Does it make a different if I play with shield rush or leap slam?
[2022-12-10 23:25:48] <%TheBestJoe> well, a shield is going to give you more defense
[2022-12-10 23:25:51] <Jusu2g> tried rf first time this league and having a blast!
[2022-12-10 23:26:03] <%TheBestJoe> leap slam might give you more damage? and it will let you go up and down ledges and through doors I think

[2022-12-10 23:30:40] <+Andrivyn> @Pohx did the lower boots drop rate and thats why so expensive?
[2022-12-10 23:31:04] <@%lemoncoolers> @Andrivyn they're always expensive in the first couple days because they drop off maven. They go down quick though
[2022-12-10 23:31:11] <%lucasTi> i wish there was an item to move enchants over
[2022-12-10 23:31:40] <+Andrivyn> @Pohx can you make a less good guide so the boots are cheaper? thanks moon2S
[2022-12-10 23:31:49] <@%lemoncoolers> just kill maven EZ
[2022-12-10 23:31:57] <+n64overclocked> last league the boots were like 10-15c 2-3 days in

[2022-12-10 23:49:51] <starblazers1966> wings need to be crispy, not breaded extra large and the sauce should be warm when applied.  I grew up in Buffalo and only get wings when I go back at either Anchor Bar or Duffs.
[2022-12-10 23:49:52] <riccal> @btclark i totally i agree. i still prefer them lol. much easier to eat

[2022-12-10 23:54:44] <naomi105> hello stream, did the rare mobs feel different from arch nemisis in 3.19 this league start?
[2022-12-10 23:54:59] <+twitchaccountforsmite> I cant seem to use Malev, Det, and  Purity together despite having all the same mana reservation efficiency nodes as you? Anything I could be missing?
[2022-12-10 23:55:14] <+twitchaccountforsmite> I mena I can but then I dont have the mana for frostblink
[2022-12-10 23:55:21] <+DodyDortman> can you get 2 harvests in one map?
[2022-12-10 23:55:43] <+Gixxerdude> @tyn85 Do you know what its called by chance?
[2022-12-10 23:55:43] <@%lemoncoolers> @twitchaccountforsmite you use skitter instead of malev until you get a reservation jewel

[2022-12-10 23:58:02] <simplygrass> how do rare enemies feel now after AN? Is there a noticeable difference in your opinion?
