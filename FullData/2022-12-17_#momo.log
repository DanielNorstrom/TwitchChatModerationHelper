[2022-12-17 00:23:25] <%Vakiiri> A lot of farms want to do better of their animals, but the corporations that make them sell super cheap makes it hard for them to do so. Its why I always try to buy from the farms directly or at farmers markets. They get all the profits that way and it means more money goes to better care for the animals they raise
