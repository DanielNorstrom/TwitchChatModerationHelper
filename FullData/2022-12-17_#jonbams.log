[2022-12-17 15:02:59] <@%^Nightbot> Please forward all complaints about the streamer being late to the Chat President by typing @BismarckSD into the chat, accompanied by a toxic message.
[2022-12-17 15:09:27] <%AspAxe> @BismarckSD Why do toxic people not know they are toxic? It's not like they “don't know”. They know they're being toxic, but refuse to acknowledge it. Because they feel they are not the one who's wrong, it's always other's fault. They blame others for their situation and condition. And most toxic people are self centered and have high ego.
