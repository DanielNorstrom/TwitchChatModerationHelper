[2022-12-10 11:18:10] <$silverskullz> You should map it out of graph paper before building
[2022-12-10 11:18:51] <%+Kathom67> Use an online map generator to get a layout :)
[2022-12-10 11:18:58] <%+Kathom67> "maze generator"
[2022-12-10 11:19:07] <$silverskullz> Or that
[2022-12-10 11:19:29] <FreshBrew> i think this is something you spend 5mins a day on eventually you have something
[2022-12-10 11:19:40] <%+Kathom67> I just found ***. You can easily customize that.

[2022-12-10 12:09:00] <Darkmoon_OG> same argument can be made for subscribing to WoW or similar MMO... you pay to enjoy pixels.. other people pay to enjoy different types of hobbies and all they get in return is memories... it's just personal preference.  There will always be people who have negative opinions of virtual goods.

[2022-12-10 14:07:14] <Krynnan> Maybe half-goddess mode activated?
[2022-12-10 14:07:32] <%+ever_theunicorn> or creative mode maybe?
[2022-12-10 14:07:37] <EnvyMiyu> I have a hard question for you, how do you find a body of a thrall that died and is now invisible?
[2022-12-10 14:08:10] <Krynnan> Go away for a quite long distance and come back, it will reappear on the ground, most of times.
[2022-12-10 14:08:28] <grumpy_ol_bugga> oh im old ,  an when the kids pee me off yeah grump mode activated git off ma lawn type deal

[2022-12-10 14:10:34] <Krynnan> Sometime half-god mode active so you don't use stamina.
[2022-12-10 14:10:41] <%$Saintaz> Turn in a head and body what does that mean in the challanges?
[2022-12-10 14:11:03] <grumpy_ol_bugga> it happened before the server rest as well so its not likely your issue
