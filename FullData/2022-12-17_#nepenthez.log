[2022-12-17 00:02:37] <%Post_FUT_Clarity> genuinely don't understand people that despise someone, or are annoyed by someone, and then come to watch and interact...like you're proving someone lives rent free in your head, just go and watch anything else

[2022-12-17 00:05:27] <hugobajen09> Nep i have a corner technic for you, put it at the penalty spot and aim for 2.5 bars with inside the foot, should work with a guy at the front post.
[2022-12-17 00:05:38] <bluenose1988> Tuneage 😎😎

[2022-12-17 00:06:12] <%johnfive21> I haven't scored a single free kick so far this year
[2022-12-17 00:06:25] <%caseymccabe13> @lerreno gg
[2022-12-17 00:06:25] <+spiritswordtrunks> is tott Theo Hernandez worth the 480k
[2022-12-17 00:06:34] <pistolaa_1> If I have mid gullet and baby viera should I get Cafu or viera
[2022-12-17 00:06:34] <%+kingnovakin> @johnfive21 outside foot shots on free kicks are quite effective
[2022-12-17 00:06:34] <teopaul33> Try outside the foot near post 3 bars of power next time, 90% of the time it goes in
[2022-12-17 00:06:36] <%+SamSurg3> what's the record now guys ?
[2022-12-17 00:06:39] <+imythias> @pistolaa_1 i like cafu with a shadow personally

[2022-12-17 00:06:57] <%johnfive21> @kingnovakin yeah I try those a lot, can't get the power quite right
[2022-12-17 00:07:04] <+turkeytoes6969> Feed the scousers let them know it’s Xmas time
[2022-12-17 00:07:06] <+thenorwegiandrogba> So, you went back on ps5 to get more wins?
[2022-12-17 00:07:09] <+thenorwegiandrogba> ps4*
[2022-12-17 00:07:14] <harrypicko97> The gameplay so bad tonight man
[2022-12-17 00:07:23] <hugobajen09> Nep i have a corner technic for you, put it at the penalty spot and aim for 2.5 bars with inside the foot, should work with a guy at the front post.
[2022-12-17 00:07:23] <Naetep> nep can you not swear please
[2022-12-17 00:07:29] <%johnfive21> Classic Friday night gameplay
[2022-12-17 00:07:29] <madman24777> How are you controlling 2 players?
[2022-12-17 00:07:33] <%$ItsTr3ple> He knows it @hugobajen09
[2022-12-17 00:07:35] <+sergibonga> I hate how often I’ll have my opponent boxed in and they randomly clear it and it goes to his striker through on goal
[2022-12-17 00:07:38] <%+kingnovakin> @johnfive21 keep at it bro, I don’t score many, but when I do that’s how
[2022-12-17 00:07:44] <%+happyspoon897> Bought a 3million coin team to go with my fairly ridiculous untraceable team (no brag hahaha) was hoping it would inspire me to play past 11 wins this week but it did the complete opposite, all I achieved was losing money on tax and price drops. I could have comfortably got 11 wins without the 3million coins spent -_-
[2022-12-17 00:07:47] <nyk_samc> hugo wont like that nep!!!
[2022-12-17 00:07:48] <harrypicko97> Lost 5 in a row earlier, but won about 7 in a row last night it’s just mad

[2022-12-17 00:23:30] <+tundebayode> people misconstrue you analyzing the gme with complaining, its literally the aim of a stream to speak about the game and what happening in it regardless of if its positive or negative
[2022-12-17 00:23:30] <%$ItsTr3ple> Wow
[2022-12-17 00:23:32] <simon_apostoleanu> huh
[2022-12-17 00:23:36] <%$ItsTr3ple> Makes no sense that
[2022-12-17 00:23:42] <harrypicko97> Wtf
[2022-12-17 00:23:42] <m3elv1n> why is the defense moving up
[2022-12-17 00:23:59] <%$ItsTr3ple> Looking like you spammed offside trap, which youdin't obviously
[2022-12-17 00:24:05] <nyk_samc> wait so what u saying? hacks or what?
[2022-12-17 00:24:20] <%johnfive21> I don';t think so
[2022-12-17 00:24:22] <%+pringle100> There have been so many of those weird, nonsensical animations - like the one Shaw does - in gameplay recently.
[2022-12-17 00:24:22] <dizzydukc> stupid game i mean comp.
[2022-12-17 00:24:23] <%+markcheesyy> Thats from a corner through
[2022-12-17 00:24:29] <nyk_samc> im confused haha
[2022-12-17 00:24:32] <+M0udi> fifa is made by candidans what do you expect ?
[2022-12-17 00:24:40] <%johnfive21> they ran back though
[2022-12-17 00:24:44] <m3elv1n> constant pressure and 70+ depth
[2022-12-17 00:24:52] <+BYCakes> Could just be using press instructions on the d pad
[2022-12-17 00:25:06] <+sergibonga> I’ve had people press me even in my box all game and they have almost full stamina at the end of the game
[2022-12-17 00:25:06] <%CfcDre02> I think he was on heavy touch press it’s a joke
[2022-12-17 00:25:10] <%jjaden10> Team press and plays it right as he loses it
[2022-12-17 00:25:23] <MaccaMover> maybe depth on 100
[2022-12-17 00:25:23] <+DenizSeason> try it then
[2022-12-17 00:25:25] <+DenizSeason> lol
[2022-12-17 00:25:28] <%+happyspoon897> I don't know about anyone else - but it feels like whenever your opponent gets inside the box and gets to the by line, it feels like the games breaks and the defenders that you aren't controlling leave their men - I guess that's why getting to the by line and cutting it back has been a thing for years. Just like you've shown there in that position, the defence breaks
[2022-12-17 00:25:32] <abctemps> hi
[2022-12-17 00:25:33] <SneakyRudolf> @jjaden10 yea id bet its team press or something like that to
[2022-12-17 00:25:34] <m3elv1n> did it feel like he was playing with 12 players?
[2022-12-17 00:25:38] <%$ItsTr3ple> Maybe you should go against your common sense
[2022-12-17 00:25:41] <azeem453> He probably gets 15 plus wins in champs
[2022-12-17 00:25:44] <xOmsSs96> that's high Sr player
[2022-12-17 00:25:49] <%+diehardgunner> David alaba didn’t start running back on defense yet lol
[2022-12-17 00:25:54] <+SCF08onFIFA> I think he plays 424 with his wingers on stay forward
[2022-12-17 00:26:05] <nyk_samc> imagine hes watching the stream
[2022-12-17 00:26:13] <nyk_samc> imagine the opponent was hugo hahahaha
[2022-12-17 00:26:15] <%$ItsTr3ple> Forward runs setting maybe ?
[2022-12-17 00:26:18] <Fictionchris> Maybe that pass only works immediately after gaining possession. Where the opponents players are stopping to move the opposite way
[2022-12-17 00:26:20] <+akimb0o4> maybe the attack positioning stat is low on your players?
[2022-12-17 00:26:32] <%JakeKett96> has to be forward runs and high depth?
[2022-12-17 00:26:34] <%+markcheesyy> He is almost playing a 5-0-5
[2022-12-17 00:27:06] <m3elv1n> might be lenghty Kappa
[2022-12-17 00:27:07] <nyk_samc> what do u reckon he was doing then?? hacking?
[2022-12-17 00:27:09] <xOmsSs96> 71+ depth and direct passing he's got for sure and possibly press after possession loss
[2022-12-17 00:27:13] <nyk_samc> @m3elv1n pfff
[2022-12-17 00:27:19] <ballerx16> If you search lebron James on Futbin pulisic comes up
[2022-12-17 00:27:28] <SneakyRudolf> orsic had to run way longer no?
[2022-12-17 00:27:31] <+theinactivestreamer> Will they change cr7 flashback links when he finds a club?
[2022-12-17 00:27:32] <nyk_samc> @ballerx16 aint no way
[2022-12-17 00:27:46] <$Mythirteen> because ur team has the slidders down and his are to 100%. its scripting
[2022-12-17 00:27:58] <ballerx16> @nyk_samc yes on mobile anyway
[2022-12-17 00:27:59] <nyk_samc> @ballerx16 hahahahaaahahhaa
[2022-12-17 00:28:08] <SneakyRudolf> nah its not that much longer u are right
[2022-12-17 00:28:11] <SneakyRudolf> and he had the ball
[2022-12-17 00:28:14] <onlygreens2k__> does the flashback ronaldos club change if he signs with a club
[2022-12-17 00:28:39] <+theinactivestreamer> ^^^^
[2022-12-17 00:28:42] <lpd1996> @onlygreens2k__ nope
[2022-12-17 00:28:46] <+DenizSeason> no @onlygreens2k__
[2022-12-17 00:28:46] <%+kingnovakin> @onlygreens2k__ don’t think so #
[2022-12-17 00:28:48] <+KevinGames2211> modded controller if they're still a thing?
[2022-12-17 00:28:49] <+akimb0o4> i think at the corner he turns constant pressure on so it goes on during the cut and then turns it off  after so his stam stays undrained
[2022-12-17 00:28:55] <%$ItsTr3ple> In my eyes, that's pressure after possession, 70+ depth and forward runs
[2022-12-17 00:29:01] <xOmsSs96> ^^
[2022-12-17 00:29:05] <+tomarnold27> would be interesting to take a match into rivals and see if you can recreate how this guy is playing, like constant pressure and all
[2022-12-17 00:29:11] <%johnfive21> I think direct passing rather than forward runs but could be
[2022-12-17 00:29:16] <%+happyspoon897> @onlygreens2k__ I wouldn't have thought so man, it's a fairly unique situation but I just can't imagine Fifa doing it
[2022-12-17 00:29:23] <%+zedsladdie> Custom tactics he will have all his midfield on "run forward" and his attacking tactic will be "direct Passing"
[2022-12-17 00:29:29] <+tundebayode> could he be spam changing his tactics on transition going from attacking to ultra defensive for example, just a guess how long does it take for the payers to react to a tactic change???
[2022-12-17 00:29:36] <xOmsSs96> nep, do u watch pros/high level fifa?
[2022-12-17 00:29:48] <%+markcheesyy> Is it a bit to do with depth? Like with out the front 4 coming back do they save stam. Back 4/5 are on the halfway very fast
[2022-12-17 00:29:52] <%johnfive21> But I guarantee you that he loses a lot of games due to this. If your defense wasn't so open he'd struggle hard to break down
[2022-12-17 00:29:54] <+Africs10> Did you see if he was on pc?
[2022-12-17 00:30:06] <nyk_samc> im really confused, so what u trying to say about the game??
[2022-12-17 00:30:10] <nyk_samc> or the opponent
[2022-12-17 00:30:12] <%$ItsTr3ple> No way you aimled that middle
[2022-12-17 00:30:13] <%+kingnovakin> @africs10 nep doesn’t have cross play on I don’t think
[2022-12-17 00:30:17] <+reece_1995> @africs10 Nep is on ps4 which can't match PC
[2022-12-17 00:30:28] <%jjaden10> Maybe he was trying or maybe he was lucky but every time he presses you it’s away ur from the best pass
[2022-12-17 00:30:36] <xOmsSs96> @nyk_samc nothing, that he just doesn't play vs many ppl that play like that
[2022-12-17 00:30:41] <+Africs10> thanks
[2022-12-17 00:30:45] <nyk_samc> @xOmsSs96 ahhh ok cheers
[2022-12-17 00:30:47] <%jjaden10> He’s also pressing you into his 2nd man or to the line
[2022-12-17 00:30:52] <+tundebayode> people misconstrue you analyzing the gme with complaining, its literally the aim of a stream to speak about the game and what happening in it regardless of if its positive or negative,
[2022-12-17 00:30:57] <lpd1996> i played a guy and it felt like he was switching formations from like a 442 on the ball in attack but then soon as he loses the ball a 5 back
[2022-12-17 00:30:57] <+Africs10> strange gamestyle
[2022-12-17 00:30:59] <nyk_samc> @reece_1995 aint he on ps5 but ps4 version of fifa
[2022-12-17 00:31:17] <lpd1996> he has lms and rms that could easily play wing back too hahag was crazy
[2022-12-17 00:31:23] <+reece_1995> @nyk_samc yeah that's what I meant. PC version of fifa is next gen so can only play ps5.
[2022-12-17 00:31:25] <+tundebayode> could he be spam changing his tactics on transition going from attacking to ultra defensive for example, just a guess how long does it take for the payers to react to a tactic change???
[2022-12-17 00:31:31] <xOmsSs96> he might have stay forward on wingers too
[2022-12-17 00:31:32] <nyk_samc> @reece_1995 ahhhh ok
[2022-12-17 00:31:55] <%Creativename_> My pet peeve about the game.. opponents players just casually jockeying around when I’m skilling my nuts off
[2022-12-17 00:32:01] <lilkumquatz> could he be holding A on xbox or X on ps to always run to the defedner
[2022-12-17 00:32:04] <islander771231> bro ea just favours some players..i dont know why and how...in mu current match i was ready to score..suddenly the game freezes..but his player runs perfectly and stops me and at 90 he scores on me..and my internet is perfectly fine..
[2022-12-17 00:32:05] <%johnfive21> If that's ai it's intercepted
[2022-12-17 00:32:08] <nyk_samc> message him and ask wht the hell his custom tactics are
[2022-12-17 00:32:09] <11moheib11> is he a pc player . i have the same problem
[2022-12-17 00:32:14] <%jjaden10> L2+Driven pass is OP
[2022-12-17 00:32:16] <boomwap5499> Fifa like lots of games is fine what works and repeat so it becomes instinctive. I’ve seen you do the roulette in the box like there’s nothing because you’re good at it and don’t even have to think about it. This guy has worked out a pass that works with pass assist and abuses it
[2022-12-17 00:32:17] <+GHO5T_X1> the games broken
[2022-12-17 00:32:20] <%jjaden10> That’s what he did
[2022-12-17 00:32:27] <SneakyRudolf> i wanna know that mans tactics so bad
[2022-12-17 00:32:33] <+BotBill32> That looks like fast build up/forward runs
[2022-12-17 00:32:34] <nyk_samc> @SneakyRudolf initttt
[2022-12-17 00:32:49] <nyk_samc> awww ur not old nep :)
[2022-12-17 00:32:51] <%+markcheesyy> If you are controlling a player you get meged more than anything They never touch it
[2022-12-17 00:32:56] <jp_729> Aguard I pray gets an upgrade he is so good
[2022-12-17 00:32:58] <%$ItsTr3ple> I play similar as he does, the crazy passes attempt excepted
[2022-12-17 00:33:12] <%+dtf1325> nep tbh I think the game is fooked. it feels like my tactics encourage my opponants tactics. if I go constant press then my players do and its weird as hell.
[2022-12-17 00:33:15] <%+zedsladdie> Custom Tactics I think Nep. Will have all his team on "run forward" and his attacking tactic will be "direct passing"
[2022-12-17 00:33:16] <boomwap5499> Agree with reactions. I’m 41. Feel slow playing against some people
[2022-12-17 00:33:22] <+DenizSeason> ball role pass up
[2022-12-17 00:33:28] <nyk_samc> he knows thats the play aswell
[2022-12-17 00:33:33] <+GHO5T_X1> but look at the direction of your guy
[2022-12-17 00:33:53] <xOmsSs96> he's defo got stay forward on wingers
[2022-12-17 00:33:58] <danielclements98> tried gakpo yet nep?
[2022-12-17 00:34:13] <%$ItsTr3ple> Like they stutter before sprinting
[2022-12-17 00:34:15] <+nevito1987> Hey Nep, fancy a game?
[2022-12-17 00:34:19] <%johnfive21> It takes time for your players to start sprinting, I think that's delay. It's awful
[2022-12-17 00:34:29] <lilkumquatz> is controlled right stick push n run a thing
[2022-12-17 00:34:31] <nyk_samc> can u message him and ask for his tactics??
[2022-12-17 00:34:43] <+DenizSeason> @johnfive21 I mean isnt that how it works when u run irl lol
[2022-12-17 00:34:46] <SneakyRudolf> no disrespect but i can see how he ran past them there, started chasing to late with defender
[2022-12-17 00:34:47] <+nevito1987> fancy a game?
[2022-12-17 00:34:48] <+tundebayode> could he be spam changing his tactics on transition going from attacking to ultra defensive for example, just a guess how long does it take for the payers to react to a tactic change???
[2022-12-17 00:34:55] <robbiehelmes92> 40 minutes in to the game, you should be able to read that he always runs straight. Your player switching is your downfall there aswell.
[2022-12-17 00:34:58] <%$ItsTr3ple> Look there on the mini-map , line of 4 on top already
[2022-12-17 00:34:59] <%+markcheesyy> Its not his team though. Its only the 2 in midfield. The other 4 stay where they arte
[2022-12-17 00:35:03] <@%CaniSports> how did you even record like this?
[2022-12-17 00:35:05] <%johnfive21> @DenizSeason I don't mean reach full speed, but you hold spring but they jog for a second
[2022-12-17 00:35:18] <danielclements98> think low driven shot is more broken than travella
[2022-12-17 00:35:27] <deroZe_ttv> an odd acceleration feature that is inaccurately adjusted in it's current state that's for sure
[2022-12-17 00:35:28] <%$ItsTr3ple> Go back to when you attack, his line of 4 juststick up top
[2022-12-17 00:35:56] <+sergibonga> Whatever his tactics are, his stam should be fully drained by the 60th min with how he plays
[2022-12-17 00:35:56] <nyk_samc> @CaniSports obs i think
[2022-12-17 00:36:00] <SneakyRudolf> looks like hes stay forward with 4 people or something crazy like that
[2022-12-17 00:36:12] <+spiritswordtrunks> no way you're still going on about this

[2022-12-17 00:36:44] <SneakyRudolf> im pretty sure 4 ppl are stay forward, makes good early press as well when ur trying to play from the back
[2022-12-17 00:36:48] <%$ItsTr3ple> The map is crazy, when you attack, his line up top is spread up, when he gets the ball, they all reduce the width
[2022-12-17 00:37:03] <+Bigshakk> did he sub in dembele
[2022-12-17 00:37:06] <+Bigshakk> wtf is that stam

[2022-12-17 00:37:30] <+SCF08onFIFA> He's playing 4-2-4 with wingers on stay forward, they don't come back
[2022-12-17 00:37:32] <%johnfive21> 4 attackers just stay at halfway line non stop
[2022-12-17 00:37:36] <+tundebayode> could he be spam changing his tactics on transition going from attacking to ultra defensive for example, just a guess how long does it take for the payers to react to a tactic change???

[2022-12-17 00:38:17] <%johnfive21> look at radar at his front 4 when you attack
[2022-12-17 00:38:19] <%+whufcconnor> every pass was pinpoint

[2022-12-17 00:38:33] <nyk_samc> make this a tiktok
[2022-12-17 00:38:34] <lilkumquatz> craziest goal i’ve seen in fifa 23
[2022-12-17 00:38:41] <+tundebayode> could he be spam changing his tactics on transition going from attacking to ultra defensive for example, just a guess how long does it take for the payers to react to a tactic change???
[2022-12-17 00:38:41] <+nevito1987> fancy a game?
[2022-12-17 00:38:52] <SneakyRudolf> u sure its not stay forward with the front 4?
[2022-12-17 00:38:53] <nyk_samc> message him and ask him whats he using as custom tactics
[2022-12-17 00:38:54] <+SCF08onFIFA> It's not press, it's wingers on stay forward
[2022-12-17 00:39:01] <%johnfive21> Team Press instruction?
[2022-12-17 00:39:03] <aa9skillslegend> wussp guys nepenthez here and weeeelcome to another episode of the draft to glory
[2022-12-17 00:39:18] <lpd1996> imagine if he has everyone on man mark 🤣
[2022-12-17 00:39:26] <%+diehardgunner> You can tell if they are pressing my looking at the back line
[2022-12-17 00:39:30] <%$ItsTr3ple> Team press has a delay before happening, he does it instantly
[2022-12-17 00:39:34] <nyk_samc> that goals nuts
[2022-12-17 00:39:38] <+nevito1987> Nevito8787 fancy a game? give you a confidence boost
[2022-12-17 00:39:38] <+SCF08onFIFA> They're not aggressively attacking you, it's 100% stay forward
[2022-12-17 00:39:39] <SneakyRudolf> high def line with stay forward on front 4 i think it is
[2022-12-17 00:39:45] <%+whufcconnor> jesus
[2022-12-17 00:39:55] <SneakyRudolf> i might try it myself looks good
[2022-12-17 00:40:06] <nyk_samc> hes not a bad player aswell though
[2022-12-17 00:40:30] <%johnfive21> against player controlled defender you can do that pass, not if AI controlled
[2022-12-17 00:40:30] <robbiehelmes92> The other player is really good at playing a pass through your defenders
[2022-12-17 00:40:43] <+nevito1987> I'm 35 fancy a game?
[2022-12-17 00:41:00] <%$J1___> @nevito1987 ask another 400 times
[2022-12-17 00:41:04] <%$ItsTr3ple> Stam is mad
[2022-12-17 00:41:09] <+tundebayode> could he be spam changing his tactics on transition going from attacking to ultra defensive for example, just a guess how long does it take for the payers to react to a tactic change???
[2022-12-17 00:41:12] <%johnfive21> the stam levels are insane
[2022-12-17 00:41:16] <+sergibonga> People constantly do passes even when marked by 2 defenders and it works because this game favors dumb play
[2022-12-17 00:41:18] <lpd1996> thats crazy how much it looked like you moved the gk out the way
[2022-12-17 00:41:28] <nyk_samc> if this was me i wouldnt have a controller hahaha
[2022-12-17 00:41:31] <+moeabouhassan> Are there going to be more swap tokens ?
[2022-12-17 00:41:59] <SneakyRudolf> @moeabouhassan dont think so
[2022-12-17 00:42:09] <needthatneymar> how does this guy always find something to complain about
[2022-12-17 00:42:13] <toiletdestroyer6990> Is he hacking
[2022-12-17 00:42:13] <%Creativename_> more passionate players
[2022-12-17 00:42:14] BAN: needthatneymar
[2022-12-17 00:42:15] <11moheib11> can u ask him ?
[2022-12-17 00:42:24] <%+Jack_Lacey2005> Potentially press on possession loss with the perfect width and depth. Or could be switching between tactics.
[2022-12-17 00:42:24] <%johnfive21> I really want to know this guys tactics
[2022-12-17 00:42:29] <%+JRDZ96> ask him for his tactics maybe see what hes doing
[2022-12-17 00:42:31] <xOmsSs96> it's a lot to do with player switching as well
[2022-12-17 00:42:50] <%$ItsTr3ple> Like the old L1 Sprint boost
[2022-12-17 00:42:53] <%Creativename_> what's sprint boost?
[2022-12-17 00:43:01] <+sergibonga> But even if he’s not on constant pressure surely his stam should be lower in the 88th min unless every player in his team has 99 stam
[2022-12-17 00:43:02] <%krk0707> really enjoyed the streams today. take care neppo. neppoLove neppoLove neppoLove neppoLove
[2022-12-17 00:43:04] <taharizwan22> Isn’t that L1+R2 for sprint boost
[2022-12-17 00:43:06] <+nevito1987> fancy a game?
[2022-12-17 00:43:07] <+trainyhcafc> you just tap r2
[2022-12-17 00:43:12] <%imexyy> doubletap RT when you get the ball
[2022-12-17 00:43:13] <%+xqtJack> hi nepo
[2022-12-17 00:43:21] <+turkeytoes6969> Maybe using the lb sprint boost I use it a lot to sprint into space
[2022-12-17 00:43:21] <+tundebayode> his palyers are have solid player and team player trait
[2022-12-17 00:43:28] <%imexyy> or R2 on ps
[2022-12-17 00:43:31] <@%Witchwalker70> @nevito1987 I don't think he does
[2022-12-17 00:43:31] <nyk_samc> i think nevito wants a game, not sure could be wrong
[2022-12-17 00:43:32] <+SCF08onFIFA> Try stay forward and low interceptions in 424
[2022-12-17 00:43:38] <MezzYouUp> u prefer 3 holding mids or 2 holding mids
[2022-12-17 00:43:41] <$Mythirteen> nep add him and ask him about that
[2022-12-17 00:43:42] <%Creativename_> @turkeytoes6969 what do you? just hold it?
[2022-12-17 00:43:44] <%$ItsTr3ple> I feel like sometimes going against common sense for some passes is needed
[2022-12-17 00:43:54] <robbiehelmes92> The reason why he has so much stamina is because he has his defensive line very high up. He has 4 players on stay forward. Then he is never sprinting expect when he drives forwards with his players. But this game was bullshit thougt. He was passing through your players and was lucky
[2022-12-17 00:43:59] <+tundebayode> could he be spam changing his tactics on transition going from attacking to ultra defensive for example, just a guess how long does it take for the payers to react to a tactic change???
[2022-12-17 00:44:23] <+cisco555> Hey Nep, how are you doing tonight?
[2022-12-17 00:44:27] <+sergibonga> @itstr3ple oh for sure, having a footballing brain doesn’t usually get rewarded on this game
[2022-12-17 00:44:28] <xOmsSs96> @tundebayode no
[2022-12-17 00:44:30] <+nevito1987> fancy a game? do you ever do play vs fans?
[2022-12-17 00:44:32] <%+Jack_Lacey2005> Could be switching between 424 tactics. One set up for drop back and the other constant pressure. Attacks on constant pressure then switches back to drop back when losing the ball
[2022-12-17 00:44:35] <$Mythirteen> @tundebayode STOP spamming dude
[2022-12-17 00:44:36] <harrypicko97> Was Viera worth the grind?
[2022-12-17 00:44:47] <%$J1___> flash back CR7 is mental good
[2022-12-17 00:44:49] <+tundebayode> @xOmsSs96 maybe
[2022-12-17 00:44:58] <%+pierce_23> i really want Dalot do we all think he gonna drop?
[2022-12-17 00:45:02] <louis_tobicks44> Do you like the new showdowns nep? I’ll watch your video later but briefly wondered
[2022-12-17 00:45:05] <xOmsSs96> a lot of it comes down to player switching and marking
[2022-12-17 00:45:09] <+cisco555> Man I really regret not completing Enzo
[2022-12-17 00:45:10] <+shaqhinds03> I took Cafu :(
[2022-12-17 00:45:10] <%+xqtJack> fb cr7 way overpriced
[2022-12-17 00:45:15] <fortnitenormiesweirdchamp> Flashback Ronaldo is insane
[2022-12-17 00:45:21] <%johnfive21> High defensive width, low attacking
[2022-12-17 00:45:26] <callumalc7> Thiago
[2022-12-17 00:45:31] <%+happyspoon897> Does interception setting affect stamina?
[2022-12-17 00:45:32] <+nevito1987> Can test vs me if you like
[2022-12-17 00:45:36] <+tundebayode> @tundebayode just want to get neps opinion sorry
[2022-12-17 00:45:55] <%$ItsTr3ple> Wasn't it 424
[2022-12-17 00:46:08] <SneakyRudolf> yea i think something like that is spot on
[2022-12-17 00:46:10] <SneakyRudolf> tbh
[2022-12-17 00:46:13] <+SCF08onFIFA> Looked like 424
[2022-12-17 00:46:29] <+cisco555> are we reverse engineering an opponents Tactis?
[2022-12-17 00:46:39] <SneakyRudolf> im pretty sure u nailed it with something like that

[2022-12-17 00:47:31] <sterudd123> Aggressive interceptions would cause his players to press more wouldnt it?

[2022-12-17 00:48:30] <%$ItsTr3ple> Pushing forward with Guendouzi is amazing
[2022-12-17 00:48:35] <%+Kieran96cfc> NFFC_Lovey hes just trying to figure out what tactics his opponent was using
[2022-12-17 00:48:43] <robbiehelmes92> but when he had the run on the outside, when he didn't trigger the run. His players were making the runs
[2022-12-17 00:48:46] <blueb1rd> Putting fullbacks on stay back while attacking then using the custom DPAD tactics to push them forward on counter attacks. That's what I do and I think that's what the guy you played was doing
[2022-12-17 00:48:49] <SneakyRudolf> im gonna try it myself
[2022-12-17 00:48:52] <%$J1___> give it a go 100%

[2022-12-17 00:49:23] <+SCF08onFIFA> Should be long ball imo. He was just running simple diagonal lines with CM and maybe manually having wingers make runs
[2022-12-17 00:49:25] <%+happyspoon897> Conservative interceptions on DM's maybe?
[2022-12-17 00:49:30] <Kolakillenhg> Dani Alves special card is honeslty mental, he scores every finesse, dont ask me why

[2022-12-17 00:54:55] <AHugeGorilla> I tried it briefly, left stick dribbling is a lot nicer. Crazy how old gen is potentially better haha

[2022-12-17 00:55:50] <+jjellis16> any adjustments to be made if you move to old gen?
[2022-12-17 00:56:12] <CylonBry> has Newport and gorilla ever had a competitive fifa game before?

[2022-12-17 00:56:29] <AHugeGorilla> Wouldn't know without seeing
[2022-12-17 00:56:47] <AbdulTarar> maybe it wasn't the tactic and the player

[2022-12-17 00:58:10] <%+markcheesyy> Is it the L1 driven
[2022-12-17 00:58:18] <+GeorgeH7_> Josh probably
[2022-12-17 00:58:22] <%$ItsTr3ple> Defensively, that's defo not it
[2022-12-17 00:58:27] <eechoppa> If you can use skills well In fifa central formos are deffo OP
[2022-12-17 00:58:44] <twosyncgoats22> did hugo get banned
[2022-12-17 00:58:45] <%chrisdepot> @kinglester26 like adams and Turner did well but not good enough to even be considered for TOTT
[2022-12-17 00:58:54] <%CfcDre02> Anyone else’s timed finishing always gets turned off?
[2022-12-17 00:59:05] <m4nny1403> LUL LUL
[2022-12-17 00:59:12] <kinglester26> @cisco555 mckennie, adams controlled every game and dest had the highest 1v1 dribbles out of anyone during group stage
[2022-12-17 00:59:21] <+DenizSeason> custom tactics can only go so far
[2022-12-17 00:59:38] <%+happyspoon897> @AHugeGorilla he basically looked like he'd found a way to maintain stamina throughout the game so it didn't impact his gameplay, which is why I think his first touches/accelerations were so effective. Every played had over half stamina even in the last 15/20 minutes. I could understand that on strikers that were on stay forward but this was DM's who were pressing and box to box. Mental
[2022-12-17 00:59:52] <+shaqhinds03> Nep is not the tactician no more
[2022-12-17 00:59:58] <Konstantino_> ronaldo is shit on  old gen
[2022-12-17 01:00:09] <kinglester26> @cisco555 adams had the most ground covered and most influential tackles in group stage as well
[2022-12-17 01:00:18] <%+xqtJack> I might try this nep
[2022-12-17 01:00:24] <%+Jack_Lacey2005> Nep try custom defence things from the d pad
[2022-12-17 01:00:49] <+tundebayode> all his players had the solid player and team player trait lol
[2022-12-17 01:01:06] <AHugeGorilla> @happyspoon897 Maybe a glitch or something on old gen?>
[2022-12-17 01:01:10] <+Rigo411> U just cant have fun in this game everyone plays counter attack park the bus running down the wing for a cut back pass its so fucking bad
[2022-12-17 01:01:30] <hcoRDarkPrince> hi guys i have fifa 23 and in some things i cant choose what i want because when i push up , down , left or right it allways goes back where it was doed anyone knows how to solve ?
[2022-12-17 01:01:30] <+Rigo411> Plus the dervers are terrible so u have button delay

[2022-12-17 01:01:59] <%+whufcconnor> Ronaldo in this game just doesnt work
[2022-12-17 01:02:04] <xOmsSs96> @ahugegorilla I think it was just the way he was marking and player switching with High depth and POTENTIALLY press after possession loss
[2022-12-17 01:02:08] <%+whufcconnor> im not a fan personally
[2022-12-17 01:02:13] <Richm1996> this game is truly shocking. it's the same shit every game. just everyone 2 man pressing and all their players on speed. It's stupid
[2022-12-17 01:02:16] <eechoppa> Need midfielders on get forward
[2022-12-17 01:02:35] <harrypicko97> Speed up lag is the worst
[2022-12-17 01:02:39] <harrypicko97> Literally can’t do anything
[2022-12-17 01:02:47] <%+happyspoon897> @AHugeGorilla potentially, it's something that I've never even seen before and I only play Fifa on old gen. Reminded me of the overload ball side from a few years ago before it drained stamina - different effect but had a similar impact on the players/game
[2022-12-17 01:02:53] <rjball3> is there a reason you wear fingertape, or is it something else?
[2022-12-17 01:03:02] <%chrisdepot> Do you think work rates affect it
[2022-12-17 01:03:02] <eechoppa> As with the drop back the CM’s just float in the middle so you’re only left with 3 for the attack
[2022-12-17 01:03:04] <%+Jack_Lacey2005> Players don’t have too far to go on fast build up when on 100 depth
[2022-12-17 01:03:08] <kinglester26> Set cm and cams to get into box they create 1-2 passing lanes
[2022-12-17 01:03:11] <%$hazzat1345> Sinking 500ks worth of fodder will fix the Ronald problem Kappa

[2022-12-17 01:03:30] <$zahonlyegyptian> i’ve reached the point where if people run down the byline just to sweat a pass in the box i just quit i can’t be bothered to play against such a pathetic play style

[2022-12-17 01:03:33] <SneakyRudolf> a gift from the gods
[2022-12-17 01:03:45] <michaelmcallion73> might be the high back line meaning less running
[2022-12-17 01:03:46] <BlackwellTV> Ronaldo does not know this 'pass' of which you speak.
[2022-12-17 01:03:56] <%+kingnovakin> Al9 is a joke

[2022-12-17 01:05:24] <blueb1rd> Nep what were your thoughts on Gvardiol? For me his base 81 was my favourite CB in the game, and his new card is lights out good

[2022-12-17 01:11:45] <kinglester26> Nep not sure if you saw comments during game. Do you think any American players deserve tott I’m thinking mckennie and dest deserve one
[2022-12-17 01:11:51] <%+markcheesyy> I think Friday is better than Sunday for free wins and people wanted to get games done with quicker
[2022-12-17 01:12:03] <nyk_samc> can u make a tiktok or yt vid on tactics nep???
[2022-12-17 01:12:05] <%+lcd2098> Al owarain is how Henry should play in game

[2022-12-17 01:12:19] <eechoppa> Americans In TOTT😂😂😂😂😂😂
[2022-12-17 01:12:29] <+Craig951> had 5 rage quits in 13 games so far on WL.. well done community 👍
[2022-12-17 01:12:33] <+BYCakes> Maybe it was a delayed input cos you got bumped doing the elastico
[2022-12-17 01:12:47] <nyk_samc> can u make a tiktok or yt vid on tactics nep???
[2022-12-17 01:13:03] <kinglester26> @eechoppa so you think kane deserves one he had 1 good game and the cost England a game
[2022-12-17 01:13:04] <stemil19> chill @nyk_samc
[2022-12-17 01:13:31] <%+lcd2098> no Americans deserve a card
[2022-12-17 01:13:39] <%+whufcconnor> never assume just send it
[2022-12-17 01:13:42] <eechoppa> Don’t forget alot of the big shouts for TOTT had stories phenoms or moments
[2022-12-17 01:14:00] <bluey999> back to back 20-0 to 40k from 3 83 x 5 packs
[2022-12-17 01:14:03] <%$ItsTr3ple> 3 of them did
[2022-12-17 01:14:11] <samx1012> maybe he read the pass to bale and tried to intercept it and got punished for manually defending
[2022-12-17 01:14:27] <nyk_samc> good game that one
[2022-12-17 01:14:31] <boomwap5499> Those tactics have changed my game no end.  Cheers
[2022-12-17 01:14:46] <supermercadotelebancos> EA put Gavi in. So Americans could have a TOTT. Their achievement was better than Spains. And Musa, Mckennie and Adams played a good tournament.
[2022-12-17 01:14:49] <nyk_samc> what u done to ur finger nep??

[2022-12-17 01:15:02] <+jjellis16> if you're not controlling the player, the player shouldn't intercept or cut as pass...

[2022-12-17 01:15:02] <%+DeanCrawfordTWA> How’re you finding RVP?
[2022-12-17 01:15:04] <kinglester26> @lcd2098 look up dest stats he was #1 in group stage for successful 1v1 dribbling success and mckennie controlled every game in the midfield we got beat on the wings by netherlands
[2022-12-17 01:15:09] <%+stackmillz> rather play a game like that then play 1-0 game
[2022-12-17 01:15:10] <%$ItsTr3ple> Nvm you saw it LUL
[2022-12-17 01:15:12] <%+lcd2098> gavi didn't deserve one either

[2022-12-17 01:30:25] <+bluemoon_cityzens> right.. you would have a problem running against 4222 no? because of the width
[2022-12-17 01:30:51] <+skaadenbby> what about long balls?
[2022-12-17 01:31:15] <+ScottyyBoiii> wasn't that on forward runs when you loaded tactics up nep?
[2022-12-17 01:31:16] <Ethan10___> Upamecano or correa?
[2022-12-17 01:31:22] <m4nny1403> Get done on over the top if u lose ball while attacking?
[2022-12-17 01:31:22] <+gingur6> is it just more or is this fit champs weekend so easy
[2022-12-17 01:31:33] <jack_russell67> how wide is 100 width in the narrow formation
[2022-12-17 01:31:50] <+jonnytesfa> If they let content creators be managers, it’s you over Bateson imo
[2022-12-17 01:31:53] <Ethan10___> Chat upamecano or correa?

[2022-12-17 01:32:19] <%theJFKexperience0> I feel like this tactic was made for vieira
[2022-12-17 01:32:26] <%+its__Maaax> show st please
[2022-12-17 01:32:32] <%+TheMSGamer93> does this work on old gen only?
[2022-12-17 01:32:40] <jack_russell67> Ethan10__ I wouldn't do any tbh but probs correa if u want

[2022-12-17 01:33:03] <+skaadenbby> so this would work with 4231?
[2022-12-17 01:33:05] <%Creativename_> lovely thanks
[2022-12-17 01:33:09] <%Arkuvio> Thankyou for talking us through this Nep, appreciated big time 👌

[2022-12-17 01:33:18] <+bluemoon_cityzens> can i see acuna and enzo again?
[2022-12-17 01:33:19] <Kvalheimaren> midfield cover wing? or center=
[2022-12-17 01:33:24] <%chrisdepot> Basically a full attacking line up with playing an offside trap
[2022-12-17 01:33:30] <+trainyhcafc> @its__maaax stay forward
[2022-12-17 01:33:38] <+calcium_77> Don't you feel with this game that's heavy wing orientated that you get exposed out wife cause your so narrow
[2022-12-17 01:33:39] <%+TheMSGamer93> is this tactic old gen only?
[2022-12-17 01:33:46] <%Creativename_> @Kvalheimaren wide mids cover wing, central cover centre
[2022-12-17 01:33:49] <greenforestbear89> 4Head 4Head 4Head
[2022-12-17 01:33:53] <%+its__Maaax> @trainyhcafc thx
[2022-12-17 01:33:55] <+0lly> its seems so backwards but somehow right
[2022-12-17 01:34:00] <jack_russell67> have u tried step up on ur defenders? changed my game ur defence dosent sit deep like it bormally does
[2022-12-17 01:34:01] <gabigabigabiars> how is gakpo so cheap?
[2022-12-17 01:34:06] <+iamlucidb> 100 depth sounds scary though
[2022-12-17 01:34:19] <+bluemoon_cityzens> 2nd man press you mean?
[2022-12-17 01:34:22] <+jonte8877> play a game so we can see neppo
[2022-12-17 01:34:27] <%BrackenWBA10> That’s all people on old gen do though
[2022-12-17 01:34:30] <+bluemoon_cityzens> oh true okay
[2022-12-17 01:34:33] <samx1012> have you tried "cut passing lanes" on cdms?
[2022-12-17 01:34:37] <%chrisdepot> Kind of playing like Saudi Arabia against Argentina lol
[2022-12-17 01:34:43] <kman3164> Would it work on PS5?
[2022-12-17 01:34:45] <artem30_drone_strike> Will there be any more swaps tokens in store? I need exactly one for vieira😢
[2022-12-17 01:34:57] <+JordanHind> hi nep
[2022-12-17 01:35:05] <+bluemoon_cityzens> you never switch your full backs to join attack using the pad?
[2022-12-17 01:35:05] <+trainyhcafc> @artem30_drone_strike still 6 to comec
[2022-12-17 01:35:08] <+skaadenbby> is this for new gen only?
[2022-12-17 01:35:14] <%Arkuvio> If Correa gets upgraded he will be an animal
[2022-12-17 01:35:15] <+ham1ltonn> is cristiano worth doing?
[2022-12-17 01:35:16] <%+Supplecactus> Correa is brilliant, so agile and quick
[2022-12-17 01:35:17] <%chrisdepot> Try his inform
[2022-12-17 01:35:27] <toiletdestroyer6990> do we put cdm on cut passing lans
[2022-12-17 01:35:27] <+JordanHind> hi nep
[2022-12-17 01:35:28] <%Creativename_> If Correa is anything like his IF he will be disgusting
[2022-12-17 01:35:30] <+smokeymcpot_99> Get him done if you want him mate!
[2022-12-17 01:35:34] <+calcium_77> How do you attack with it ? Do you play slow build up or quick interlink passing 1-2's
[2022-12-17 01:35:38] <+bluemoon_cityzens> is he worth it?
[2022-12-17 01:35:38] <%+jockyd78> If Correa gets upgraded, he’ll be a beast
[2022-12-17 01:35:44] <%+its__Maaax> im just away to play with him on 2 chem
[2022-12-17 01:35:50] <%chrisdepot> Give his inform a try before you do the sbc
[2022-12-17 01:35:50] <+jamesmmvxlizzosmom> He’s very good in game nep. 14 goals and 3 assists in 10-0 qualifying!
[2022-12-17 01:35:50] <artem30_drone_strike> I never felt his composure is a let down on IF
[2022-12-17 01:35:52] <jack_russell67> just composure is an L for me
[2022-12-17 01:35:53] <vegarking> Correa is really clinical in-game
[2022-12-17 01:35:53] <%$ItsTr3ple> Did he sell ?
[2022-12-17 01:35:56] <+tenma_1019> You could do 'press after poss lose' kinda very effective and remarkably noticeable
[2022-12-17 01:36:12] <%theJFKexperience0> Nep goes back to Montiel like I go back w my ex
[2022-12-17 01:36:13] <NiceToMichu09> Jesus corona?

[2022-12-17 01:36:28] <+ashwinsuresh1> CAM stay forward or nah?
[2022-12-17 01:36:29] <+bluemoon_cityzens> you never switch your full backs to join attack using the pad?
[2022-12-17 01:36:37] <gabigabigabiars> gakpo so cheap its crazy

[2022-12-17 01:36:39] <%$Jakers9> You have enough for Al Owairan?
[2022-12-17 01:36:41] <%+Supplecactus> You could play Correa RM and get a striker or use Ronaldo
[2022-12-17 01:36:46] <%$ItsTr3ple> He's really common in packs
[2022-12-17 01:36:46] <%+whufcconnor> 60k is crazy

[2022-12-17 01:37:09] <%+Supplecactus> I just used Gakpo and Dumfries in a team and found them both to be very heavy unfortunately but not too bad neppoHeart
[2022-12-17 01:37:12] <+JordanHind> LUL LUL
[2022-12-17 01:37:12] <m4nny1403> @nepenthez u think it’s worth investing in these specials since there so low

[2022-12-17 01:37:25] <kman3164> Gakpo is better than correa
[2022-12-17 01:37:30] <archiemep17> gakpo striker, correa rm?
[2022-12-17 01:37:35] <%+Jack_Lacey2005> Nep you can get gakpo and Dumfries for full chem

[2022-12-17 01:37:50] <Jbyoungbuck> Correa is amazing in game
[2022-12-17 01:37:54] <+bluemoon_cityzens> you never switch your full backs to join attack using the pad?

[2022-12-17 01:37:59] <kman3164> Would your tactics work on PS5?
[2022-12-17 01:38:03] <%theJFKexperience0> Stoich is so clinical
[2022-12-17 01:38:04] <+jefzy_> Correa feels so agile and fast
[2022-12-17 01:38:06] <%bingbongnyk> i wish there was a loan for stoichcov, i want to try him out
[2022-12-17 01:38:11] <tavvsen> He is amazing

[2022-12-17 01:38:38] <%+Mido_fedo> he is amazing in game with engine
[2022-12-17 01:38:39] <%+Supplecactus> Whenever an SBC is pretty expensive I normally think it’s because EA know the player is good, tried Correa and he’s brilliant even without the upgrade neppoDab
[2022-12-17 01:38:41] <tavvsen> Engine
[2022-12-17 01:38:44] <%+whufcconnor> Chiesa CAM and Kean striker?

[2022-12-17 02:00:43] <AndoG11> seeing this proofs how bad this packs are and how low the lack weight is. that's why you can't pack anything usefull even if you go like 19-1

[2022-12-17 02:06:26] <$zahonlyegyptian> doesn’t it get old to repeatedly restart a new RTG with just with different stipulations only to reach the goal within a month max?

[2022-12-17 02:06:37] <miguel_baus> The Ronaldo is insanely pricy, but don’t you think he is insane ingame with that speed?
[2022-12-17 02:06:40] <%+jpipy> could do a monthly vid of like how to start fifa in x-month, would be similar to what you suggested plus works with the algorithm

[2022-12-17 02:09:43] <%+Supplecactus> He’s expensive for a reason though. He’s brilliant in game and with the upgrade can be nuts
[2022-12-17 02:09:44] <justaskingaq> my bad you had him
[2022-12-17 02:09:47] <mlatif223> I’m tempted to get banned just so I can appear in the next unban requests video lol

[2022-12-17 02:09:54] <%ntblue1034> Argentina better win the WC now

[2022-12-17 02:10:15] <sterudd123> Muller
[2022-12-17 02:10:16] <$zahonlyegyptian> that Dalot seems really cheap for being the 2nd best RB card in the prem
[2022-12-17 02:10:17] <%jjaden10> I’ve been using him in champs, 4-0 4g 6a
[2022-12-17 02:10:21] <jackarta042> Is this the rtg still?
[2022-12-17 02:10:23] <mlatif223> 50 yr old still playing champs ? Impressive
[2022-12-17 02:10:29] <%+Supplecactus> Have you got Vlahovic still? Could link Keane and Vlahovic
[2022-12-17 02:10:45] <+jameldh55> correa is good, did my first 10 futchamps games with him at left CAM and he scored 16 with 6 assists, 9 - 1 is my record

[2022-12-17 02:11:18] <kman3164> I DM’d you the elf on the shelf idea on instagram Nep 👍🏼
[2022-12-17 02:11:20] <schefeyyy> It's kind of sad that they couldn't give us a higher rated player for the showdown for the literal world cup final... like surely both of the cards starting at a 90 could have been do able
[2022-12-17 02:11:20] <supermercadotelebancos> Nep Kean name is pronounced Ken
[2022-12-17 02:11:33] <+ecuamobb> Whats uP Nep
[2022-12-17 02:11:34] <%jjaden10> I thought @mlatif223 meant he was 50 but maybe that’s devil’s advocate
[2022-12-17 02:11:40] <+dantebeline1> 9
[2022-12-17 02:11:43] <jack_russell67> think it's 4

[2022-12-17 02:13:55] <humza_c> nep how is montiel?
[2022-12-17 02:13:55] <%+jaythemillerman> might has well keep him this time haha 😄
[2022-12-17 02:14:01] <%$istreet98> Do you think what you've just done is what EA are hoping people do? No grindable content so you've spent Fifa points on an account you wouldn't normally do
[2022-12-17 02:14:11] <justaskingaq> 70k is crazy
[2022-12-17 02:14:23] <%$Jakers9> I had really good hero and icon pack luck so I kinda have to use the players and it’s annoying since I can’t really try build fun teams now
[2022-12-17 02:14:26] <%smithy9996> Have you done POTM Leao as well?
[2022-12-17 02:14:29] <%+whufcconnor> yeah hunter on kean for sure
[2022-12-17 02:14:30] <jack_russell67> hawk on kean is nice
[2022-12-17 02:14:30] <%Post_FUT_Clarity> I don't think he's backtracking guys, he tried to make a joke, a bad one, but still
[2022-12-17 02:14:35] <steohenw8> This Correa is soo good
[2022-12-17 02:14:35] <danield887> What’s up nepenthez I’ve been watching you years bro
[2022-12-17 02:14:38] <%josh_rawlins21057> Can’t wait for the Christmas music to get out of the charts
[2022-12-17 02:14:42] <%Prynner11> Rooting for Argentina on Sunday then LUL
[2022-12-17 02:14:43] <%+Supplecactus> L1 dribble with Correa in the box is brilliant

[2022-12-17 02:15:22] <+Pramosjr00> do you think the transfer market refresh update was on purpose or a ea fuck up?
[2022-12-17 02:15:23] <%Post_FUT_Clarity> almost all showdown cards have low composure
[2022-12-17 02:15:25] <sterudd123> Yeah engine
[2022-12-17 02:15:30] <willl_h> could you not use goncalo ramos for enzo?
[2022-12-17 02:15:31] <+sam_playboi> 80 composure tho
[2022-12-17 02:15:31] <+dantebeline1> Correa has a great card but his composure on his base let me down a lot in the early stage of the game, hopefully Argentina win for the upgrade
[2022-12-17 02:15:36] <+sarujan_m> Boost his passing maybe?
[2022-12-17 02:15:37] <+apa852> do u think upamecano is a must do.. especially with the chance up upgrading?
[2022-12-17 02:15:53] <mlatif223> Nep I apologise for my earlier comment It was just a stupidly planned joke which wasn’t even funny

[2022-12-17 02:31:13] <+3dgyracoon> theres actually quite a lack of 90+ pace 5* skillers in the game, probably another reason cr7 is spenny
[2022-12-17 02:31:31] <6ahki3> fut champs is so worthless, i got rank 2 and max rating i got was 87 lmao

[2022-12-17 17:06:13] <alonballas3> Why did you decide to put fifa points on?
[2022-12-17 17:06:13] <Stallone986> hopefully CR7 feels like his last flashback card
[2022-12-17 17:06:13] <%+Cavacom> i would feel better about the price of flashback CR7. but 13 days is not enough time
[2022-12-17 17:06:15] <+TimmyLH44> Old gen
[2022-12-17 17:06:17] <%+taylorallen133> I’m glad you’ve decided to have fun I could see the deflation in your face at the end of every ep just packing Kaylor Navas and rinsing and repeating the last few eps of it

[2022-12-17 17:06:38] <%+steviek4> CR7 not worth it. I spent 500k not a 500k card imo. 250k at most
[2022-12-17 17:06:43] <danielclements98> what's the best way to get fodda to do the ronaldo sbc?
[2022-12-17 17:06:46] <%$J1___> Especially for his links
[2022-12-17 17:06:47] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> "The majority of people can see this for what it is. A 500k souvenir. A gaudy Eiffel Tower you bring home to put on a shelf.

[2022-12-17 17:06:55] <%m3elv1n> cr7 should have been the same price as messi
[2022-12-17 17:06:55] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> That was my summation of ronaldo
