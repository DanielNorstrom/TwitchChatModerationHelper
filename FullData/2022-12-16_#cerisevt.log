[2022-12-16 11:28:55] <+FinalCipher> the hammerer manages punishments and executions
[2022-12-16 11:28:59] <socialistOtter> Hammerers are part of the dwarven justice system
[2022-12-16 11:28:59] <Rahsed> I would imagine hammerer is someone who hammers novaKappa
[2022-12-16 11:29:01] <$MyrkDomolith> @FinalCipher Yep. They're the peeps who set broken bones, apply casts and such.
[2022-12-16 11:29:02] <mcfishlicka> Hammerer is the executioner. They squish the skulls of bad dwarves
[2022-12-16 11:29:14] <x3revolt> Ah the ban hammerer

[2022-12-16 11:30:34] <$MyrkDomolith> They're just the "We don't have prison cells so instead we'll beat up criminals" option.

[2022-12-16 12:08:15] <%Kent_Lang> Tarn Adams kind of develop the game the way he feels like working on it and he usually works alone with his brother. That might change now though with the release of steam. He mentioned apparently that he had outsourced Linux support for example.
[2022-12-16 12:08:19] <Reapingyou> billon is an alloy of copper/silver

[2022-12-16 12:10:05] <Reapingyou> you should look through the ore and some of them it is more efficient to smelt them directly into an alloy than smelting into a pure bar
[2022-12-16 12:10:11] <Quitutatur> would be better to put it to infinity so you don't get a spam of "not found"
[2022-12-16 12:10:31] <%Kent_Lang> Have we found magnetite, limonite or hematite?

[2022-12-16 12:34:54] <@%TheKneecapKnabber> @LT_Jakal I did a poll earlier with 2 of the same option and it didn't tie
[2022-12-16 12:34:58] <+FinalCipher> an 11th voter could extract so many concessions for a tiebreaker here
[2022-12-16 12:35:06] <%bloodiest_burrito> coins are made at the forge

[2022-12-16 12:37:18] <%MichelozzoOnTwitch> If you mean keeping stock of your inventory, there's a job you need to give a dwarf to get accurate readings
[2022-12-16 12:37:21] <Quitutatur> if you had put a letter instead of a number i'm sure it would have won

[2022-12-16 13:12:48] <%+Nashikage> Deeeeeeeeeeeeep
[2022-12-16 13:12:52] <%Kent_Lang> There's a application called "Soundsense" which adds notification call outs, extra music and other sounds to the game.
[2022-12-16 13:12:59] <%Memil03> And how deep have you dugg?
[2022-12-16 13:13:00] <Quitutatur> in theory the training is already a wrestling arena but not for spectators and instead to learn
[2022-12-16 13:13:08] <Grim177> just don't wake the balrog from Lord of the Rings
[2022-12-16 13:13:13] <+FinalCipher> theoretically you can dig very deep, but it gets harder the deeper you get
[2022-12-16 13:13:23] <!%+Galondir> They dug too deep, the darkness was stirred. yocciSuffer
[2022-12-16 13:13:28] <+FinalCipher> however, the rewards get greater too

[2022-12-16 14:46:59] <%Spitalier> best way to deal with a full corpse pile is to make a dumping zone and drop all the corpses you dont want anymore onto it.

[2022-12-16 14:55:57] <healbotfh> check the titan's specific combat log and scroll down
[2022-12-16 14:56:05] <Frozen_Tear> was it made of berries?
[2022-12-16 14:56:29] <%Spitalier> @Frozen_Tear normal chitin and scales. Nothing a metal weapon cant deal with.

[2022-12-16 14:57:09] <%+MeetTheScorch> the force from impact i assume
[2022-12-16 14:57:17] <nerdmeistere> yeah be worried when you get a titan made out of steel or one that has super OP abilities like fire or webs
[2022-12-16 14:57:18] <%hangtown08> titan rolled them 1's critical miss
[2022-12-16 14:57:25] <dogwaterelitism> Literally domed him

[2022-12-16 14:59:16] <%+MeetTheScorch> iirc the butchering job is always active
[2022-12-16 14:59:18] <%Synesh> It's automatic as far as I know, or you need a pest capturing workshop
[2022-12-16 14:59:28] <healbotfh> your dorfs will take his corpse if the "haul outside refuse" is enabled in standing orders tab
[2022-12-16 14:59:32] <%Synesh> As long as you have a butcher it's fine
[2022-12-16 14:59:48] <nerdmeistere> @healbotfh correct

[2022-12-16 15:02:17] <%+MeetTheScorch> the new UI really could use some search boxes
[2022-12-16 15:02:36] <healbotfh> yeah in the zone screen it shows room value
[2022-12-16 15:02:46] <%Spitalier> When you select the zone you can inspect the details. There you find the target value and the current.
[2022-12-16 15:03:11] <$NaoMiyaVA> Sent a pic of the Cerise 3D avatar, ain't super accurate but quite close I guess
[2022-12-16 15:03:15] <%Spitalier> current 111 and target 2000
[2022-12-16 15:03:30] <%Synesh> That's the value, you want smooth walls, decorative and store items and larger size to improve it

[2022-12-16 15:04:11] <$NaoMiyaVA> And I can make dance vids with it
[2022-12-16 15:04:12] <@%LT_Jakal> I tried using Vroid who no experience, and it has a steep learning curve lol
[2022-12-16 15:04:50] <$NaoMiyaVA> I had no experience, got to where I got by playing around for 7 months
[2022-12-16 15:04:59] <%Spitalier> wait
[2022-12-16 15:05:09] <!%Mysteryem> Vroid is nice because it lets the mostly 2D artists make 3D stuff
[2022-12-16 15:05:20] <@%LT_Jakal> its the "for 7 months" part of that sentence that scares me lol
[2022-12-16 15:05:27] <%Spitalier> you can turn raw boulder in workshops into stone blocks with a x4 output.

[2022-12-16 15:07:14] <%Memil03> @Galondir oh noo... Gl at work tho
[2022-12-16 15:07:19] <%Spitalier> when you mine stone you have about 25% chance toi get a boulder. with turning them into stoneblocks you can increase your amount of a certain stone material. But Blocks are only useable for construction not crafting.
[2022-12-16 15:07:34] <!%Mysteryem> Load the entire .vrm into T.I.T.S. so we can throw it at you in glorious t-pose yokaiLUL

[2022-12-16 15:07:50] VIEWERS: 225
[2022-12-16 15:08:34] <%Spitalier> you can even define a specific type of stone for the blocks. Otherwise the workers grab whatever they want.
