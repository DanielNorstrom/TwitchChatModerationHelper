[2022-12-16 11:28:55] <+FinalCipher> the hammerer manages punishments and executions
[2022-12-16 11:28:59] <socialistOtter> Hammerers are part of the dwarven justice system
[2022-12-16 11:28:59] <Rahsed> I would imagine hammerer is someone who hammers novaKappa
[2022-12-16 11:29:01] <$MyrkDomolith> @FinalCipher Yep. They're the peeps who set broken bones, apply casts and such.
[2022-12-16 11:29:02] <mcfishlicka> Hammerer is the executioner. They squish the skulls of bad dwarves

[2022-12-16 12:02:24] <$MyrkDomolith> @Kent_Lang Understatement. They get what's called "Cave adaptation." After that, if they go outside, they get sick and puke.
[2022-12-16 12:02:46] <Reapingyou> might be more than those pieces
[2022-12-16 12:02:52] <Reapingyou> need to check other workshops

[2022-12-16 12:03:42] <%Kent_Lang> It looks that way.

[2022-12-16 12:04:40] <$MyrkDomolith> @Reapingyou I forget where the setting is, but there's one that auto-forbids used ammo. You can change it to "only forbidden during sieges" or "Claim all"

[2022-12-16 12:08:15] <%Kent_Lang> Tarn Adams kind of develop the game the way he feels like working on it and he usually works alone with his brother. That might change now though with the release of steam. He mentioned apparently that he had outsourced Linux support for example.
[2022-12-16 12:08:19] <Reapingyou> billon is an alloy of copper/silver
[2022-12-16 12:08:53] <Quitutatur> anything below "smelt metal object" is Ore smelting pixcatCoffee

[2022-12-16 12:09:59] <%Kent_Lang> You primarily want to smelt iron bearing ores and coal.
[2022-12-16 12:10:05] <Reapingyou> you should look through the ore and some of them it is more efficient to smelt them directly into an alloy than smelting into a pure bar
[2022-12-16 12:10:11] <Quitutatur> would be better to put it to infinity so you don't get a spam of "not found"
[2022-12-16 12:10:31] <%Kent_Lang> Have we found magnetite, limonite or hematite?
[2022-12-16 12:10:32] <Reapingyou> under work orders it will be something like 'make ALLOY-HERE from (ore)'

[2022-12-16 12:34:27] <Quitutatur> Look we are a bit indecisive alright?
[2022-12-16 12:34:31] <+FinalCipher> why is this fort so obsessed with coins suddenly? we can't give them away, we need to make them
[2022-12-16 12:34:39] <Rahsed> Dear gawd
[2022-12-16 12:34:54] <@%TheKneecapKnabber> @LT_Jakal I did a poll earlier with 2 of the same option and it didn't tie
[2022-12-16 12:34:58] <+FinalCipher> an 11th voter could extract so many concessions for a tiebreaker here
[2022-12-16 12:35:06] <%bloodiest_burrito> coins are made at the forge
[2022-12-16 12:35:10] <Quitutatur> If anything you asked for Thanos to vote pixcatLaughholiday Perfectly balanced as all things should be

[2022-12-16 12:36:14] <+FinalCipher> @Quitutatur i think he'd just ignore the poll and insist his choice was the only option
[2022-12-16 12:36:30] <@%LT_Jakal> This tie breaker brought to you by KneeCapKnabber, and the 10th voter Jakal yokaiLUL
[2022-12-16 12:36:43] <@%LT_Jakal> I mean
[2022-12-16 12:36:48] <Quitutatur> Wouldn't his choice be to make everything balanced tho? pixcatCoffee
[2022-12-16 12:36:49] <@%LT_Jakal> 5 way tie, god my brain doesn't work
[2022-12-16 12:37:14] <+FinalCipher> a bookkeeper will unlock the ability to see what you have
[2022-12-16 12:37:15] <healbotfh> can check your metal bars in stocks
[2022-12-16 12:37:18] <%MichelozzoOnTwitch> If you mean keeping stock of your inventory, there's a job you need to give a dwarf to get accurate readings
[2022-12-16 12:37:21] <Quitutatur> if you had put a letter instead of a number i'm sure it would have won
[2022-12-16 12:37:25] <%MichelozzoOnTwitch> A bookkeeper I believe is the term

[2022-12-16 13:13:00] <Quitutatur> in theory the training is already a wrestling arena but not for spectators and instead to learn

[2022-12-16 13:13:13] <+FinalCipher> theoretically you can dig very deep, but it gets harder the deeper you get

[2022-12-16 14:56:05] <Frozen_Tear> was it made of berries?

[2022-12-16 14:57:17] <nerdmeistere> yeah be worried when you get a titan made out of steel or one that has super OP abilities like fire or webs

[2022-12-16 14:59:16] <%+MeetTheScorch> iirc the butchering job is always active
[2022-12-16 14:59:18] <%Synesh> It's automatic as far as I know, or you need a pest capturing workshop
[2022-12-16 14:59:28] <healbotfh> your dorfs will take his corpse if the "haul outside refuse" is enabled in standing orders tab
[2022-12-16 14:59:32] <%Synesh> As long as you have a butcher it's fine

[2022-12-16 15:02:17] <%+MeetTheScorch> the new UI really could use some search boxes
[2022-12-16 15:02:36] <healbotfh> yeah in the zone screen it shows room value
[2022-12-16 15:02:46] <%Spitalier> When you select the zone you can inspect the details. There you find the target value and the current.
[2022-12-16 15:03:11] <$NaoMiyaVA> Sent a pic of the Cerise 3D avatar, ain't super accurate but quite close I guess
[2022-12-16 15:03:15] <%Spitalier> current 111 and target 2000
[2022-12-16 15:03:30] <%Synesh> That's the value, you want smooth walls, decorative and store items and larger size to improve it

[2022-12-16 15:04:11] <$NaoMiyaVA> And I can make dance vids with it
[2022-12-16 15:04:12] <@%LT_Jakal> I tried using Vroid who no experience, and it has a steep learning curve lol
[2022-12-16 15:04:50] <$NaoMiyaVA> I had no experience, got to where I got by playing around for 7 months
[2022-12-16 15:04:59] <%Spitalier> wait
[2022-12-16 15:05:09] <!%Mysteryem> Vroid is nice because it lets the mostly 2D artists make 3D stuff
[2022-12-16 15:05:20] <@%LT_Jakal> its the "for 7 months" part of that sentence that scares me lol
[2022-12-16 15:05:27] <%Spitalier> you can turn raw boulder in workshops into stone blocks with a x4 output.

[2022-12-16 15:07:19] <%Spitalier> when you mine stone you have about 25% chance toi get a boulder. with turning them into stoneblocks you can increase your amount of a certain stone material. But Blocks are only useable for construction not crafting.
[2022-12-16 15:07:34] <!%Mysteryem> Load the entire .vrm into T.I.T.S. so we can throw it at you in glorious t-pose yokaiLUL

[2022-12-16 15:08:34] <%Spitalier> you can even define a specific type of stone for the blocks. Otherwise the workers grab whatever they want.
