[2022-12-17 17:10:43] <+Velmarg> That shows how overtuned she was that she could get three fairly significant nerfs and still be the best hero in the game.
[2022-12-17 17:10:45] <+MsMaomao> railgun does so much damage but if they change it too much it'd be useless to ever use it
[2022-12-17 17:10:47] <gappyspins> Nerf Genji
[2022-12-17 17:10:47] <Leinadlink> I think it shouldn't charge as fast

[2022-12-17 17:10:55] <+Guts72> With a mercy pocket, she basically got buffed. She can one shot more often

[2022-12-17 17:11:09] <%+SergeantBraine> I saw a good suggestion. Get rid of the railgun as an alternative fire and only have it in the ult.
[2022-12-17 17:11:18] <RAN_Bryguy> I can see them remove headshots from railgun

[2022-12-17 17:11:23] <%Serenade212> what if they change the ammo so you have enough ammo to charge just above charge to let you miss some shots

[2022-12-17 17:11:33] <m0nt_twitch> maybe they just remove the headshot modifier? Maybe you can burst down half hp squishies
[2022-12-17 17:11:39] <+HalcyonRyan> I love her, she is so fun and it is so rewarding to hit, but also ha so and widow can one hit you and no one seems to care?
[2022-12-17 17:11:46] <+Guts72> I think her charge rate is way too fast
[2022-12-17 17:11:46] <funnyvoice_> you could drastically change her playstyle and make her more fun to play, like nerf her damage drastically, but then buff her mobility
[2022-12-17 17:11:47] <bofaoyl> the decay of the railgun should start at like 3 seconds  instead of 5
[2022-12-17 17:11:55] <%Culein_> we just need they release a new dps so they buff him and send sojourn to the ground
[2022-12-17 17:12:03] <null_sett> yeah i think they'll end up removing headshot
[2022-12-17 17:12:16] <SirTryhard7> Yes exactly lol
[2022-12-17 17:12:30] <+eurobond> maybe as the weapon charges base damage drops off a bit
[2022-12-17 17:12:33] <+MsMaomao> railgun plus random junker queen bullet from range

[2022-12-17 17:30:16] <pocketwolfspitz> I wish they would make vortex stronger
[2022-12-17 17:30:20] <%Seishinz> Sojourn made more sense in a 6v6 scenario... One shots in 5v5 feel like an insta-loss Team Fight
[2022-12-17 17:30:20] <+ceeDizzzle> are you ever gonna play valorant?
[2022-12-17 17:30:21] <+khota123> I think the second they iron out balance is when the game can actually start really flourishing, cus it's good rn but it can reach levels beyond anything
[2022-12-17 17:30:22] <+SoullesGaming> a better hog
[2022-12-17 17:30:27] <%$ThisIsCrabTV> @cutie_smileyy And if you do give it another try: Good luck! You got this emongEZ
[2022-12-17 17:30:33] <+kaos1120x> Do you have the trident emote already?
[2022-12-17 17:30:42] <%+cutie_smileyy> @cutie_smileyy Yeaah but i only have one person to play with
[2022-12-17 17:31:01] <Zenickks> @pjgoats orisa,
[2022-12-17 17:31:05] <i8keee> hi
[2022-12-17 17:31:13] <mcreaper233> Do you think Rammatra Nemesis speed will get nerfed a bit?
[2022-12-17 17:31:22] <%$asfelon> I personally think removing the headshot and buffing cap dmg to 140/150 would do the job

[2022-12-17 17:31:39] <Zenickks> @seishinz agree
[2022-12-17 17:31:47] <Mrzgamerx> I honestly thing the punchs in nemesis form need just a small range buff
[2022-12-17 17:31:48] <%$ThisIsCrabTV> @Seishinz imo there should be only one hero that is able to do oneshots
[2022-12-17 17:31:48] <scoups> How do I motivate myself to play more comp? I just get streaks of ppl leaving and it is so hard to win w 4 ppl

[2022-12-17 17:31:52] <%$LeWitcher> When I saw the first video of Sojourn I thought her ult was just a one big shot that goes through walls emongL
[2022-12-17 17:32:26] <Zenickks> there is a very prominent problem, one shots shouldn't be allowed in overwatch

[2022-12-17 17:32:28] <vecxfps> whose a better tank now, rein or doom?...and is winton a better dive tank than doom now or no?
[2022-12-17 17:32:29] <+khota123> @Seishinz I'd say 2 because Widow Hanzo, I think snipers should be able to one shot, but not like roadhog sojourn
[2022-12-17 17:32:37] <+SFWildBill> sweet lol
[2022-12-17 17:32:46] <%Culein_> I’ve seen meme one shot headshot with sleep dart. He is crazy.
[2022-12-17 17:32:56] <%+Jokoyaki> maybe could be part of tank passive?
[2022-12-17 17:32:59] <!%xx_m3m3_m4chine_420_69_xx> i don't like to brag
[2022-12-17 17:33:01] <%$ThisIsCrabTV> @Seishinz I forgot about Hanzo. Ok, then 2: Widow and Hanzo and not more - especially not when it's as busted as Sojourn
[2022-12-17 17:33:04] <+khota123> Oh of course that's the next step, Rein speed buff and firestrike to 100 would make him pretty decent actually
[2022-12-17 17:33:12] <pocketwolfspitz> Before the patch as Ram I felt very much like I needed a pocket healer or speed boost to get anything done
[2022-12-17 17:33:12] <%$ThisIsCrabTV> @Culein_ PogU
[2022-12-17 17:33:14] <%$LeWitcher> Culein_ you saw Meme play ana?

[2022-12-17 17:33:23] <%Culein_> One time I saw meme kill 4 people in a bar, with a pencil.
[2022-12-17 17:33:27] <justhans03> if ramattra was made to suddenly shift the timing of a fight, then the speed boost makes sense

[2022-12-17 17:33:51] <%Seishinz> The main problem with Sojourn is that she doesn't trade power for mobility

[2022-12-17 17:34:34] <+Stefinitely> speed boost passive screwed me over on widowmaker so many times

[2022-12-17 17:39:49] <alieeeni> @SoullesGaming Supports in low elo actually try to do way too much dps than just try keeping someone alive, altho reins also tend to feed too much

[2022-12-17 17:40:27] <pocketwolfspitz> The issue in metal rank is people don’t understand the job of tanks or how to work with them. It’s basically death match rules
[2022-12-17 17:40:29] <Mrzgamerx> @SoullesGaming This is very true, had a Zen and ana with like no healing and then they wonder why Im dying LOL

[2022-12-17 17:40:32] <+4ud3n> i find low elo reins the learning curve, its the reason ppl seem to think more dps and more heals wins games rather than utility being valuable.
[2022-12-17 17:40:35] <EndeRs_1337> @SoullesGaming see that's hard tho because you're supposed to support with damage but there is a fine line

[2022-12-17 17:51:11] <salty_josh> I don't think every hero needs to be viable in every situation. it's fine for tanks like Rein, Orisa, etc to have their niche and only do well in those circumstances

[2022-12-17 17:51:53] <+InuRobot> The empowered punch simple needs to be a gaseous glowy bubble aura type deal. So it can absorb a little bigger of an area, but it shrinks to current size when he's at about 90% charge.

[2022-12-17 17:52:30] <+thetrashgolem> I just hope he doesn't get mcu'd
[2022-12-17 17:52:31] <%+BigRobDidIt> Is matchmaking bugged? Cause I'm a low plat and was being put in a game with diamonds, masters and GMs. I was woefully out of my skill area
[2022-12-17 17:52:33] <VikingKong_> still sojourn @findingnameishard
[2022-12-17 17:52:39] <%+4ud3n> i'd say winton still best dive tank, especially if you want to play team and coordinated, but if youre solo pugs  and wanna drop in the backline cause chaos and havoc then you'd wanna doom or ball
[2022-12-17 17:52:45] <+khota123> @CHICKEN2XD Power creep in general isn't good for a game like overwatch
[2022-12-17 17:52:48] <allthecoino> ramattra is tragic now but give him four months and he'll be buffed crazy and be op
[2022-12-17 17:52:52] <%+masakiss_eucalyptus> how many days remaining up until rammatra gets available in comp?
[2022-12-17 17:52:55] <allthecoino> mark my words
[2022-12-17 17:53:05] <vecxfps> whose a better tank now, rein or doom?...and is winton a better dive tank than doom now or no? @emongg

[2022-12-17 22:49:22] <NoxSnooze> so w/ the ram changes is it still better to just block during ult or to pewpew
