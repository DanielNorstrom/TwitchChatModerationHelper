[2022-12-31 18:09:21] <+TheKrawfish> Twitch doesnt allow anyone to host with more than 50k viewers
[2022-12-31 18:09:22] <%smokyapples> he couldnt raid cause it was 200k ppl
[2022-12-31 18:09:22] <13Boomzy> he cant beacuse to many peopl;e
[2022-12-31 18:09:22] <Owlygg> twitch wouldnt let him raid with more than 50k viewers or some shit
[2022-12-31 18:09:25] <%+yourmomsafan> lanmark said you can only raid up to 50k people
[2022-12-31 18:09:26] <%Azy666> theres a 50k cap on raiding now I think

[2022-12-31 18:09:37] <+TWITCHpoker> What a dumbass rule
[2022-12-31 18:09:38] <Lusthus> He could not raid because it was to many people
[2022-12-31 18:09:40] <stevetwitch7> On their schedule
[2022-12-31 18:09:46] <%smokyapples> he sent ppl over to still try and raid
[2022-12-31 18:09:47] <%dad_bod_dixie> he didnt raid but he spammed landmarks twitch link about a million times for ppl to keep getting drops
[2022-12-31 18:09:50] <%stinger_72> Twitch
[2022-12-31 18:09:52] <stevetwitch7> Cause there basically printing money lmao

[2022-12-31 18:10:05] <+TWITCHpoker> Twitch needs to adjust to their bigger numbers now
[2022-12-31 18:10:20] <Lusthus> It's to not have people send "bots" to the same chanels
[2022-12-31 18:10:32] <thesequelsaretrash> KEKW it would make too much sense for twitch to allow that

[2022-12-31 18:20:29] <+JoeyG24> I think his gripe was with the fact that twitch is forcing streamers to run ads when it wasnt like that for years.

[2022-12-31 18:20:37] <%Dewy144> @AyeGavMF just so you know turbo gives the streamer the ad rev of streams unless they changed it

[2022-12-31 20:11:28] <littlenerd04> what i like..  and my personal opinion. is that hutch plays so may games.     not scared to sit on one.

[2022-12-31 20:17:56] <Svckerss> Yeah. I can imagine in this game it's crap. I remember doing the Dark and Darker games with a duo, and every single players we came against were 3-manned.
[2022-12-31 20:18:21] <MainnMethod> as a solo I almost always run into solos
[2022-12-31 20:18:21] <%InfiniteTricks> Solo in this game is more viable than in Dark and Darker IMO
[2022-12-31 20:18:54] <Stumpy801> you can wipe a 4 man in this solo way easier than dark and darker LUL

[2022-12-31 21:58:35] <%DefiantMF> @durtydog67 It might be some issues with hardware compatibility. (I have personally never heard of such an instance) In that case you will have no fixes except the expensive ones.

[2022-12-31 22:00:41] <Krvy> @durtydog67 ive had something similar but with EasyAntiCheat the fix was to look up the anticheat in file explorer and repair and rix the file

[2022-12-31 22:49:02] <SeeraX2> chances are you were moving in place and they knew it's a pmc
[2022-12-31 22:49:09] <+akaBlackbeard> or at least i thought thats what the other guy said
[2022-12-31 22:49:10] <@%AyeGavMF> you werent moving and santas always moving so they probably had time to see that u were the imposter
[2022-12-31 22:49:12] <+zakman16> what happens when you kill santa chat?
[2022-12-31 22:49:13] <%fqbabydad08> i find that a lot of people are letting scav rep go. ive died more as a scav by scavs then i have with my PMC
[2022-12-31 22:49:14] <%Chroniq> the grammer police are here, HIDe lol
[2022-12-31 22:49:15] <%justchillinjay> was probably easier to tell you weren't santa being dc'd
[2022-12-31 22:49:24] <MrSkeletonX> I bet some new players dont even know about santa
[2022-12-31 22:49:27] <+Technical_13> Is it me or does Klean blink a lot
