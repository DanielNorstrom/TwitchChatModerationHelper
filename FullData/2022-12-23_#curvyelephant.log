[2022-12-23 10:17:20] <+teachj> Fountain sodas are always better than cans/bottles. Same with beer on tap vs can/bottle.

[2022-12-23 10:17:36] <+SadisticDove> I've met alot of people who say coke is better in glass, but I just don't get it
[2022-12-23 10:17:37] <+Willman232> the plastic bottle permeates carbonation which is why it tastes better from a can @curvyelephant

[2022-12-23 10:42:15] <+Go1d_N> From what I've seen with different streamers, the snow acts two different ways without really changing weather. One is normal and grippy and then it gets slick and what you're experiencing rn

[2022-12-23 15:51:07] <@%^StreamElements> I'm currently playing on a whitelisted GTA V RP server called NoPixel using the FiveM client ( https://fivem.net ). If you're interested in joining, visit https://nopixel.net to apply. To answer a few questions, you do NOT need to be a streamer to play on NoPixel. You will very likely have to wait a fair amount of time to receive a response to your application given the recent influx of people interested in playing.

[2022-12-23 16:21:03] <@%^StreamElements> I'm currently playing on a whitelisted GTA V RP server called NoPixel using the FiveM client ( https://fivem.net ). If you're interested in joining, visit https://nopixel.net to apply. To answer a few questions, you do NOT need to be a streamer to play on NoPixel. You will very likely have to wait a fair amount of time to receive a response to your application given the recent influx of people interested in playing.
