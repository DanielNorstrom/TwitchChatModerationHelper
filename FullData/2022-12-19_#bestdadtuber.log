[2022-12-19 05:32:20] <TechyOracle> @ynception It may be a long shot, but it sounds like you need to talk to whatever is your area's employment bureau. Forcing an employee to stay at home due to covid but still marking them for it sounds incredibly sketchy.
[2022-12-19 05:32:46] <TechyOracle> Or at least an attorney. (Not a legal practitioner at all, but your situation doesn't sound good at all).
