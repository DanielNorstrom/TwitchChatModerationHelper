[2022-12-11 14:28:38] <%+magic_mat1> Knight is so unfun I hate him so much LUL
[2022-12-11 14:28:40] <ObsidianLiger> I hate man with sword, I've only played against the ones who camp
[2022-12-11 14:28:40] <@%Loni1211> KEKW
[2022-12-11 14:28:47] <frikerf> every knight just plays the same boring way
[2022-12-11 14:28:47] <waltonbago> Slingers zoning is wayyy stronger then knight
[2022-12-11 14:28:47] <Doctor_Caustic> Would you rather go against Trickster or Plague?

[2022-12-11 14:43:54] <%helllcate_> i think as a surv the problem is more that it can be hard to spot resources without windows cause stuff all looks the same

[2022-12-11 15:05:10] <+Fliperotchy> yeah i think dbd guides unfortunately have to be about general use cases, and not the specific stuff. something that covers 80% of scenarios is the best you can do

[2022-12-11 15:29:13] <Jortand> there is always one top somewhere
[2022-12-11 15:29:13] <%GENJ1SMOM> @crocing It gives you a yellow flashlight after you rummage trough a cheat and give the killer blindness for 30 sec
[2022-12-11 15:29:13] <+tyler_tango> @crocing blindness effect on killer and you can rummage an empty chest for a flashlight I think.
[2022-12-11 15:29:17] <@%Ana1661> Gives you a beamer and makes the killer experience blindness status effect when blinded
[2022-12-11 15:29:19] <Adios899> we're 3gened badly
[2022-12-11 15:29:26] <+lumiinoous> i need help, shouldi shower rn its 10 degrees celsius rn though

[2022-12-11 15:29:28] <zippyzaean> @ana1661 mine was more accurate
[2022-12-11 15:29:30] <%CringyBingus> @crocing blinding the killer gives them blindness (the status effect which removes auras eg. gen auras), and gives the survivor one free yellow beamer (the 1 stack)
[2022-12-11 15:29:48] <crocing> omg wait i want it

[2022-12-11 15:31:28] <@%Loni1211> Wesker imo
[2022-12-11 15:31:40] <@%Ana1661> Wesker of course
[2022-12-11 15:31:44] <0rochimarusnake> @Loni1211 same but i think also wesker have more shit maps
[2022-12-11 15:31:51] <sam_vilderness> but nemi is taller Sadge

[2022-12-11 15:32:09] <%emsayss> nemi is just so uneven, some games the zombies just get stuck and do nothing for example
[2022-12-11 15:32:12] <@%Loni1211> @Loni1211 true but nemmy has some rough maps aswell, i think overal wesker is still better
[2022-12-11 15:32:14] <1800Bedtime> you mean you have a 50% chance to counter eruption
[2022-12-11 15:32:15] <trhullzz> eruption counter meta B)
[2022-12-11 15:32:16] <%Evolutioxn> you think it’s fair if a killer uses pain res and eruption together? @hens333
