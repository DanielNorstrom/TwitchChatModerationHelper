[2023-01-07 00:17:56] <!%ScorpianyTheGOAT> @oidatsmyleg It's a weighted moving average. Technically the formula uses an infinite number of games. 100 games gives you about 95% of your performance. 250 battles gives you about 99% of your performance. So you always need to play for slightly above mark requirements.

As long as you follow the rules you will be fine but if you don't follow them I will take actions when needed ;)

IVc Toaster and stuffed a menagarie unskilled crew in it. Got a 7/6/5 Encounter game on Siegfried Line and was down 11:5. Got on the hill at K3 to hide. Instead of capping they rushed us. Went from having only 1 hit to 4 kills + DMG to 4 more. We won since they choose to Kill All instead of just capping it out. #NeverLucky

[2023-01-07 18:30:02] <Gogormonchi> @Branthopolis i figure because you need to use premium ammo often?
[2023-01-07 18:30:05] <%+crisscore1> im watching stream for you not the game
[2023-01-07 18:30:08] <soulquake> @Ozylion_Axelock he is streaming on twitch yt and more
[2023-01-07 18:30:13] <%+pskol> True, with the EBR we are strong candidates to play Mario Kart.
[2023-01-07 18:30:21] <xouricoh> SOME streamers can transiction to multiple games, but its rare
[2023-01-07 18:30:25] <!%+Natexis> changing games on twitch will only work for streamers with huge boobs and deep cut-out dresses.... nobody will notice that you switch games @skill4ltu
[2023-01-07 18:30:27] <+Tutter01> Sir Foch only streaming with 300 viewers

[2023-01-07 18:30:47] <%+Branthopolis> @Gogormonchi You do need to use some in certain situations.. but overall it does pretty well on credits.
[2023-01-07 18:30:51] <t_aron05> yeah and Mr.Scheff from Hungary did it too, he losed everything because of the switch
[2023-01-07 18:31:03] <soulquake> @Natexis there is almost no top female streamer on twitch check the stats
[2023-01-07 18:31:05] <disnomic> switching platforms, not switching the game
[2023-01-07 18:31:06] <+baygonmata> but we always have the tits
[2023-01-07 18:31:18] <%+Ozylion_Axelock> @soulquake Ninja got a lot of money to switch from Twitch to YT stream exclusive. As far as I know, tht failed big time
[2023-01-07 18:31:24] <Karabash15> But SirFoch is signed to e-sports team now so he's good
[2023-01-07 18:31:25] <%+kerotomas> yup you need to establish yourself already as a multiple game streamer early or you are stuck with the one game you become famous with

[2023-01-07 18:37:40] <@%Nyxphobia> @usabroad It's a good tank, you need to use more gold since it has 100mm more pen than AP's but it has a nice gun and decent mobility

[2023-01-07 20:21:04] <@%+kapazunder> @big_yellow_banana yeah but in my understanding they only care if something like this is happening during a battle, if its happening in private massages they dont care at all. my m8 had that problem couple of years ago, but maybe things are different right now

[2023-01-07 20:22:51] <@%Basleader92> @ruus2500k they do care, but they have ban waves from time to time so you won't always instantly see a ban or something

[2023-01-07 20:24:17] <%Lexa4RU> @Lexa4RU nono, players who plays it don't know what to do with it. I have 3.5k dpg in it (for sure it's lower than all other meds t9 but still an okeyish tank)
[2023-01-07 20:24:24] <The_Beer_Sucker> how can you get this tank?
[2023-01-07 20:24:37] <@%Basleader92> @disnomic it does, if you have an employee that ads those people to the ban wave it can take a while untill something is done, some other employees insta ban, but WG does care about those tickets and they do take a lot of actions against it
[2023-01-07 20:24:40] <@%Nyxphobia> @The_Beer_Sucker Buy it when it's on sale

[2023-01-07 22:08:15] <WoT_vorbelastet> I played fcm the last few games and i really enjoyed it. Good mobility, damn good gun. Armor doesnt matter anyway because everybody presses 2 Key right after the game starts
[2023-01-07 22:08:15] <attilathehungary> @skill4ltu  Hey Skill i dont know if someone else asked this already but i was wondering when you will make videos of the missions again ( i assume not befor christmas farm session ends)

[2023-01-07 22:10:55] <Zaknafeint> This tank was my first premium like 6 years ago cant remember, helped me learn how to play paper tanks good times

[2023-01-07 22:12:17] <!%$Pirosami> @Fherot I own all the Mutz, I need to finish 3 marking them
[2023-01-07 22:12:26] <%+Bluehawk08> problem with fcm is‚Ä¶its not really a heavy tank if team is needing it
[2023-01-07 22:12:36] <@%Nyxphobia> Why ugly? It's beautiful
[2023-01-07 22:12:41] <%+x_renner_x> @eagletroop Super persh is one of my fav tanks, and it was my first 2mark.
[2023-01-07 22:12:52] <%+Fherot> @Pirosami I do need a tier VIII for my girls und panzer crew....... Should I get it back?
