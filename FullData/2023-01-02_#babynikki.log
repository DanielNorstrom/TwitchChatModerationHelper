[2023-01-02 16:47:16] <Okmhygvdesz> @yukichiy "Akemashiteomedeto" is a way to say "Happy New Year" in Japanese. It is made up of three words: "akemashite" (Êòé„Åë„Åæ„Åó„Å¶), which means "since the start of the new year," "o" („Åä), which is a honorific prefix, and "medeto" („ÇÅ„Åß„Å®„ÅÜ), which means "congratulations." Together, they form the phrase "Akemashiteomedeto," which is used to wish someone a happy new year.

This option is available the first time you start a new language to make sure you are placed in a spot that isn't too easy for you."

[2023-01-02 18:23:58] <iskandros> Because rice is such a staple dish, it's honored by giving it's name for "meal".  Although keep in mind that (especially until recently) rice would usually be eaten with every meal.
