[2023-01-07 17:18:39] <%$SamTheCellist> Cheer200 i guess my point is, if people are looking for tesla alternatives, I.E. looking for EV's at the Tier of a tesla in terms of sportiness, performance, and interior, I think people have to be willing to pay quite a bit more to get a car with arguably lesser technology without any of the AI capabilities. I'm not bullish on tesla, but its food for thought.

[2023-01-07 17:25:18] <%+barlock_james> tesla canot push its way threw snow in Idaho, they will not sell here lol
[2023-01-07 17:25:18] <%$ckay1100> Better public transportation in general would be nice too
[2023-01-07 17:25:33] <%DeezNuts_> Its an easy fix just give everyone helicopters no need for cars anymore
[2023-01-07 17:25:33] <%$DigitalChaos119> how much range loss we talking... like 10% or like 40%?
[2023-01-07 17:25:44] <quadroplextopinismation> The biggest problem with the battery that non Tesla owners don’t know is that when the car breaks it charges, in the cold it looses its charging capabilities until the battery warms up.
[2023-01-07 17:25:44] <%+marcos_b_merking> I live in texas so 300 miles isn't even enough to leave the state

[2023-01-07 17:26:42] <%$Myloxl> My hypothesis over the train networks differences in Europe/America is the US had trains for mostly industry, while Europe had trains for manpower mobilisation AND industry
[2023-01-07 17:26:44] <%+McBreezie> No politician will ever be able to do that. Gas and airline lobbiests would shut that shit down.

Even in europe, the best high speed trains dont make any money, and are a pain if you're doing long distances, things turn into a day long ordeal where you become a slave to the train schedule and if you miss a train, you're boned.

[2023-01-07 17:34:55] <%$SamTheCellist> Cheer200 all im saying is, americans who romanticize train travel seem to have a pretty provincial understanding of how trains are used. like cedkilleur said, taking a train from city to city is good. guess what, we have that in the us. people take trains from DC to New York to Boston al the time. but it gets way more complicated when you're doing long distances, and in europe, its still often way cheaper and faster to fly than take a train from say, paris to zagreb or milan to athens.

[2023-01-07 17:35:20] <$KitsuneXero> Personally, the biggest problems are that even with bigger investments in public transportation, it still doesn't even reach a quarter of the population that isn't in the bigger cities. Like, the nearest areas to pick up a train for me is either Syracuse or Utica, which is still a 45 min drive one way to either side.
