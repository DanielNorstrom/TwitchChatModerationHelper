[2023-01-11 08:44:15] <%DrQSoul> it will be hard for you @P4wnyhof to social 12 hours

[2023-01-11 08:47:11] <kklstl> I think you're over reacting. Just dipping your hands in there to get 2nd degree burns and not being able to touch kbm would be enough lUL
[2023-01-11 08:47:29] <DuckSupe> @P4wnyhof its a cult

[2023-01-11 08:48:05] <%+IcsGrec> the insane growth train for Tarkov went away a while ago
[2023-01-11 08:48:24] <%+IcsGrec> now everyone's streaimng/playing it. It's not THAT MUCH of a growth opportunity anymore
[2023-01-11 08:48:25] <%LordOverflow> Same with World of Tanks

[2023-01-11 08:49:11] <kklstl> I think streamer having to play something just for the views etc is where twitch chanels go to die. You can always tell the streamer is not having fun.
[2023-01-11 08:49:14] <%+IcsGrec> and the most recent releases haven't exactly been the best :)

[2023-01-11 09:21:59] <@%sateenvarjokauppias> @p4wnyhof i suggest getting one of those mats for standing. Helps alot with pressure on your feet
[2023-01-11 09:22:40] <Scrimitzu> oh so basically that board costs like 60$
[2023-01-11 09:22:42] <kklstl> Actually talked about this with a friend of mine that has a shoe store. Standing desks work much better if you're wearing proper footwear for standing. If you don't then you're more likely to get tired after standing for too long, which also results to bad posture after some time
[2023-01-11 09:22:47] <%+Chiendelune> Mostly using standing position for meetings and I walk in the room. So I need to comfy in my feet. Otherwise, slippers or only socks. Thinking about adding a pad

[2023-01-11 11:04:22] <+taskenshiro> it's for bad conditions that twitch has apply for his content creator

[2023-01-11 11:05:49] <freakhun_64> It is so sad what Twitch become...I think they went downhill when they let go Tim and Doc
[2023-01-11 11:05:58] <%KurtZenter> Amazon wants their PrimeSub money back
[2023-01-11 11:06:02] <%$wolw3rin3_tm> and other platform, what is the split ?
[2023-01-11 11:06:43] <%LordOverflow> Unless you stream other content to Twitch and other to YT but at same time? Let's say you stream gameplay to YT and only cam and audio to Twitch. That would be fine in terms of Twitch rules, correct?

[2023-01-11 11:08:23] <echogeek> the problem with youtube is that is hard to find streams in their platform
[2023-01-11 11:09:01] <mussemaage> !victus
[2023-01-11 11:09:36] <%+kelvasco> Key youtube vs. twitch stat though, Twitch averages nearly 3x concurrent viewers vs. youtubes gaming section. That's the killer if you want to change.
[2023-01-11 11:09:43] <echogeek> they need to do their platform more organic idk
