[2022-12-22 09:49:00] <+Qubuuuu> are they planning on 3healing this as limit?
[2022-12-22 09:49:33] <+Zweitastenyo> @Qubuuuu Limit ist 4healing
[2022-12-22 09:49:46] <%Didrinator> Blizzard has been rolling out some nerfs/fixes, so you never know. In my eyes they will probably stay over christmas, but these guys can pull miracles off and i'm sure either them or Liquid will be getting much closer soon. Obviously the ideal is that they come home for christmas :D
[2022-12-22 09:49:54] <%SmootTM> @nogan44 both said yesterday evening it will not take longer as 2 more days also today and tomorrow so maybe we see the kill today or tomorrow

[2022-12-22 10:12:44] <%chatting_in_chat> they appear to be running out of health. perhaps another healer ?
[2022-12-22 10:12:53] <binomialHeap> @Zurro27 dude, they were pulling for 15 hours. Echo just started the day
[2022-12-22 10:12:54] <night_just_> @WHATSGOODow recieved couple of nerfs in past 2-3 days
[2022-12-22 10:12:55] <+yingyang__o> @Zurro27 Liquid brute forces bosses, there's barley any logic/strat when they pull. It's why they're 100 above Echo. Also, Echo just does like 2h meetings
[2022-12-22 10:12:58] <smokeweedz> @Sieflinger @nogan44 SeemsGood
[2022-12-22 10:13:21] <matotheace> @chatting_in_chat they appear to be running out of health because they dps's die and they dont kill it fast enough. that part is dps check
[2022-12-22 10:13:39] <+yingyang__o> @chatting_in_chat They keep dying to mechanics, idk why.

[2022-12-22 10:44:32] <Did1ly> just give us global release or a tournament relm so they don't have tk do any splits 🤣

[2022-12-22 10:45:46] <sulozor> @Rosharr For me its more execution, they are not really consistent up to transition
[2022-12-22 10:45:54] <sulozor> and they still lack consistency in the transition too

[2022-12-22 10:47:35] <beekuu> im pretty sure echo will kill it

[2022-12-22 10:49:10] <beekuu> echo first unless they nerf the boss i mean liquid side is begging for nerfs
[2022-12-22 10:49:19] <Rosharr> oh you guys think that many up to 500 damm I was thinking. When you get the flow up then % goes down
[2022-12-22 10:49:33] <+Settekk> I don't think this boss dies today for echo, or tomorrow for liquid honestly

[2022-12-22 10:53:27] <+SPICEaLIFE> @ambi3n just being honest.  it is what it is.  the boss was way over tuned.  no matter who it advantages the boss had to be nerfed. but I do believe it advantages echo.  they have 14 hours on a nerfed boss.  and I believe they can make it happen
[2022-12-22 10:53:28] <massiveminnow> Bad pull.

[2022-12-22 10:56:15] <%greyfnc> @SPICEaLIFE how did you come up with that 14 hour? boss was nerfed 7 hours ago, meaning liquid had 7 hours on it already and they just went to sleep...
[2022-12-22 10:56:24] <+SPICEaLIFE> echo is an amazing team.  if be surprised if I don't go home go to bed and not wake up to a dead or almost dead boss.   but if it doesn't happen liquid will kill it tonight

[2022-12-22 11:16:36] <NoctehTV> Overall their monthly salary varies depending on their streams and the sponsors of the guild. During some other progress back when they were at Method it was agreed upon that during raiding all the money generated from streams would be pooled and divided by the amount of raiders
[2022-12-22 11:16:38] <TixesDT> @Ghostauren It's not good for anything KEKW

[2022-12-22 11:29:32] <lemaw1> @noctehtv obviously they get some low budget sponsors, but like thats how their income from that also looks like - apart from like the top 5-10 players each sport has Id be surprised if anyone else would make more money off of sponsors than their actual salary
[2022-12-22 11:30:09] <NoctehTV> @lemaw1 Again im not quite sure you're right. Nowadays sponsorship has become widely spread through social media especially

[2022-12-22 12:24:16] <brybeyblade> Guess it’s ok when the boss is looking like this. Would suck if they got it to 10% or so before reset though haha
[2022-12-22 12:24:18] <Bizzum> Na advantage is like 5 hours now since all the downtime on resets
[2022-12-22 12:24:21] <zHellbergz> @sepphinoskill liquid has 100 pulls more on the boss… how is that not still having advantage?
[2022-12-22 12:24:24] <Bizzum> So not that big anymore

[2022-12-22 12:24:43] <%+Thoreya> @zHellbergz pull count is irrelevant. liquid cud just be pulling faster than echo
[2022-12-22 12:24:49] <SepphiNoSkill> @zHellbergz they are pulling way faster as echo, as always.. different approaches
[2022-12-22 12:24:50] <brybeyblade> @zhellbergz liquid also just pulls so much faster
[2022-12-22 12:24:53] <zHellbergz> Still.. the fact that someone has advantage over others makes no sense
[2022-12-22 12:24:54] <+xaistah> well Echo analyzes it more in depth while Liquid just chain pulls
[2022-12-22 12:25:01] <swag2kappa> na still has advantage
[2022-12-22 12:25:12] <brybeyblade> It’s not like WoW designs the game around rwf either

[2022-12-22 13:13:43] <brybeyblade> @cadje this boss surely dies in 340 pulls. Dies at 27%.

[2022-12-22 13:14:54] <Cadje> That is factually incorrect sir, I predict 317.6 pulls with this dps, if they have one person die, for no more than 4 seconds. And 27% is secret phase naturally, boss dies at 240% hp

[2022-12-22 14:09:08] <%+deifypog> This boss is so boring to watch IMO. Jailor/ Sylvannas was much more entertaining
[2022-12-22 14:09:19] <%+deifypog> But cant stop watching as well LUL
[2022-12-22 14:09:29] <blizzardpolice69> this boss was overtuned the first day
[2022-12-22 14:09:37] <blizzardpolice69> so the prog was meh and the story was meh
[2022-12-22 14:09:47] <blizzardpolice69> probably more meaning in the last 2 bosses of the xpac

[2022-12-22 14:45:52] <+Zanarkand_Dream> That’s why they are not running resto druids because they are top tier

[2022-12-22 15:35:01] <+Mythr4ndir> Liquid is at 47.84%, Echo is at 48,36% but 100 pulls less than Liquid
[2022-12-22 15:35:05] <ubuhlungu> @cokezero1337 why did you think that?
[2022-12-22 15:35:10] <itsrichardsz> I really hope they finish tomorrow so they can go home for xmas
[2022-12-22 15:35:12] <trexxustv> limit is 1% in front, but aswell 100 pulls more and 1 day ahead, so theoreticly Echo is ahead
[2022-12-22 15:35:18] <milleroid> is there any way they can further increase itemlevel?

[2022-12-22 16:09:00] <baddream2> @Milkyw play what u enjoy most
[2022-12-22 16:09:04] <populuxxe> @Milkyw Spec doesn't matter at all when leveling.
[2022-12-22 16:09:18] <thallok1> real chads level with crafting
[2022-12-22 16:09:25] <+cashaga> frost still king in m+
[2022-12-22 16:09:34] <whiskass_> !best
[2022-12-22 16:09:59] <+ellements1> Frost was easier to level with for me.  Arcane got a little squishy.
[2022-12-22 16:10:02] <+Edilem> @cashaga not really
[2022-12-22 16:10:07] <Milkyw> @baddream2 @populuxxe Yeah i agree, just i've been playin mage for like 9+ years, and i stop a few times since middle SL and before by period
[2022-12-22 16:10:19] <Milkyw> so just asking, but you guys right

[2022-12-22 16:10:46] <populuxxe> @Milkyw Yeah, they made leveling so easy that really the best thing to do is play what is fun to you.

Our mettle is strained and resources stretched.  I fear I won't make it home for Christmas. Our General Scripe is leading us well and the Aspects are relying on us for victory. How I wish to hold you in my arms,  But I cannot, I must watch you from the spirit land and hover near you, and wait with sad patience till we meet to part no more.

[2022-12-22 17:40:15] <abilitytogoeven> blizzard has been excellent with the tuning of the boss so far, only having to nerf two major phases of the fight, surely everything else must be perfectly tuned.

[2022-12-22 20:03:51] <+RonnieFun> wonder if they wanted it to be so hard, but nerf coz hols coming, or whether they made a mistake in the tuning :D
[2022-12-22 20:04:02] <Van_Klinken> why are they nerfing at US hours? What is the nerf
[2022-12-22 20:04:22] <%brezzywrld> @RonnieFun Just crazy how they can put out a boss that is so overtuned, just stupid in my opinion.. xD
[2022-12-22 20:04:29] <saaax_> @Van_Klinken us company
[2022-12-22 20:04:30] <aadrica> @RonnieFun they certainly didn't, cause sepulcher took three weeks and they said they didn't want a repeat of that.  Yet here we are mostly through week two :/
[2022-12-22 20:04:45] <FluffyFloofer> @RonnieFun Uunat?
[2022-12-22 20:04:46] <%+kaado222> If there is a nerf, it needs to be around this time so both raid teams gets an equal shot at seeing it and progressing it. Liquid just getting started and I’m sure Echo would go longer in that case
[2022-12-22 20:05:02] <DaocSB> Do they dev's run the bosses before release? or do they assume they'll be killable?
[2022-12-22 20:05:02] <G425M> I mean seems like they're making some progress anyways so let's hope that blizz won't nerf it too much
[2022-12-22 20:05:06] <+derpyllama420> @Van_Klinken they nerfed it some yesterday evening when Liquid was going to bed
[2022-12-22 20:05:28] <070BLAZE> jailer was simple tbh

The electricity this man generates from perfectly executing his rotation with a 100% uptime is enough to power the whole echo facility. What does liquid have? Trill? Don’t make me laugh. I think we all know who wins this.

The electricity this man generates from perfectly executing his rotation with a 100% uptime is enough to power the whole echo facility. What does Liquid have? Trill? Don't make me laugh. I think we all know who wins this.

[2022-12-22 23:16:10] <noobmasterrrrrrrrr69> 10-15% is doable if everyone was alive and they had br but they need to push extra 5-10% on p2 which is the only phase they can push more deeps
[2022-12-22 23:16:16] <SepphiNoSkill> @LaxxasGG they simmed the chars and the strongest ones got in
[2022-12-22 23:16:22] <equpleb> don't forget how much hp they manged to dig out on sylv
[2022-12-22 23:16:24] <HouseOnFire> there should be a reward for what they are doing
[2022-12-22 23:16:24] <+Sacredlili> they know already it won't die without a nerf, so I think they'll go to bed soon
