[2023-01-05 20:33:36] <cram006> i think your spacebar is so sensitive
[2023-01-05 20:33:36] <Kyzer_val> It’s a problem with the scroll wheel I think
[2023-01-05 20:33:37] <+Lizveth> or when I try to ping
[2023-01-05 20:33:40] <pumpkin_03> do u know the scroll wheel is more sensitive than a click

[2023-01-05 20:33:46] <HotshotMLG> put camera on mouse, you might be clicking it unintentionally
[2023-01-05 20:33:49] <XeNo_19> maybe it needs to be cleaned inside
