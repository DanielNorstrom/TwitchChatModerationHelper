[2022-12-22 15:14:04] <Southrobin> because after you said its unwinnable she quietened down
[2022-12-22 15:14:07] <SmellyRocker> The only way to win that was keep legion on other side, but a 4 slow-down killer will hold a 3 gen
[2022-12-22 15:14:09] <%NightBIayde> I had a game where a survivor set up a boon in a deadzone next to a gen I was working on, and of course, the people on death hook went to that boon. The game was obviously in the Killer's favour then as he got 2 kills becuase of that. Just crazy....

He was complaining when I was standing at the 50/50 pallets and outplaying them because I wouldn't vault. The timing he goes for me, his bad connection gets me over the loop.

[2022-12-22 16:24:30] <@%$Soulaires_> @obsidianliger every other button should instantly close the game, that way it’s a fun roulette game
[2022-12-22 16:24:31] <FIESTeG> @ChemicalCranberry i played the open beta in 2016 i think and didn't played till late 2020, i missed so many things in this game

[2022-12-22 16:25:10] <ZW3IST3IN> Funny you also play almost exclusivly yellow and brown add ons on Wesker?
[2022-12-22 16:25:18] <%ChemicalCranberry> the third button unlocks dead hard while healthy
[2022-12-22 16:25:20] <@%Ana1661> @bethalyn_ I mean I actively use 6 buttons on my mouse

[2022-12-22 16:25:47] <denshev228007> I hate when bubba has the rev addon for aura read and he knows that I have distortion so he just uses all of my stacks during chase and just leaves this is so exploitable
[2022-12-22 16:25:55] <%bethalyn_> @ana1661 6?! WHERE ARE THEY?
[2022-12-22 16:25:58] <%+mig_rattlehead> Ana1661 wait you have 6 bindings on your mouse?

[2022-12-22 18:21:19] <+Trizzle56> when survivor dc it means you did something right
[2022-12-22 18:21:19] <%+globo12343> They dc because they need to get their coffee @hens333
[2022-12-22 18:21:20] <I_Can_Hz_Chzbrgr> he likely dc'd cause he got caught first and died in less than 10 sec
[2022-12-22 18:21:21] <+Jokinzazpi> Is there even a point to DCing?
[2022-12-22 18:21:25] <+NameIsMerc> survivors can not accept they messed up, better to blame killer, DC, go next
[2022-12-22 18:21:39] <JayJ_Legion> @goregonzola ur using windows over a acc good perk tho like reassurance, otr, unbreakable etc etc
[2022-12-22 18:21:58] <%+globo12343> I suppose someone can dc if they need to step away for something
[2022-12-22 18:21:59] <+Trizzle56> every match i wish i get dc's
[2022-12-22 18:21:59] <pluviophile079> Anyway you can make a youtube discussion video on dc’s to get more word out there? Cause it’s gotten really bad lately
[2022-12-22 18:22:03] <%+Fliperotchy> if youre done playing for the day, and for some reason you're an asshole, you're probably going to DC your last game haha
[2022-12-22 18:22:03] <babyjuice20> @ripaquila demon dash is A + D and a swing is with mouse(better with high dpi
[2022-12-22 18:22:04] <%+globo12343> But we know not everyone does it for that reason
[2022-12-22 18:22:06] <+Trizzle56> ur lucky
[2022-12-22 18:22:06] <%+GoreGonzola> @JayJ_Legion but windows is also a good perk

[2022-12-22 18:22:15] <+gargoyle3333> @pluviophile079 ^ that's a pretty good idea honestly

[2022-12-22 18:22:20] <%$defdo> I'm a windows addict hensPepe
[2022-12-22 18:22:25] <grumblephant> Looking for a reason why someone DCs is like asking the ocean why it waves.
[2022-12-22 18:22:25] <+NameIsMerc> I use windows yeah
[2022-12-22 18:22:26] <+Jokinzazpi> @pluviophile079 I think the best solution to this is enabling the Outplayed emote in 7TV
[2022-12-22 18:22:42] <JayJ_Legion> @goregonzola windows makes bad loopers survive bit longer, unbreakable can save a game, u can only have 4 perks
[2022-12-22 18:22:45] <%+globo12343> Windows is solid, just some ppl use it to pre-drop everything which is quite annoying
[2022-12-22 18:22:58] <I_Can_Hz_Chzbrgr> i can understand tho, if u get like multiple bad games, efficient killers etc in a row, you might get to your boiling point and dc to take a break
[2022-12-22 18:23:01] <Crazymack556> @ripaquila WASD and mouse. in other words you can both steer from looking and strafing. some people "flick" by mapping the turn/look keys to Q and E. not sure of other methods.

[2022-12-22 19:03:33] <%GENJ1SMOM> @globo12343 The right play for survivors is to stun the killer. I don't think  the killer should get rewarded for that. Same with spirit fury
[2022-12-22 19:04:08] <JayJ_Legion> @genj1smom killer needs to use 2 perks and also j pre drop
[2022-12-22 19:04:33] <+cinnamon_> mr streamer i think you're winning

[2022-12-22 19:04:43] <%+globo12343> @genj1smom but these are builds that makes the game more different. Just like when survs bring either chase or gen-rush perks, it’s the same for killer. Either bring a pallet muncher build or anti gen rush build
[2022-12-22 19:04:58] <%GENJ1SMOM> @jayj_legion I know but predropping is so boring
[2022-12-22 19:05:03] <%+globo12343> Besides spirit fury is easier to counter by pre-dropping once you find out it’s his

[2022-12-22 19:08:21] <+leonardo1ita> I think it's either Trapper or Hag

[2022-12-22 19:10:33] <%+globo12343> @genj1smom i personally don’t think that but to each their own. I feel like it makes the game more enjoyable for the killer as well if they want to go for a pallet muncher build

[2022-12-22 19:12:29] <%+globo12343> @genj1smom for me it’s just being efficient in a team. I also like going for chases but I don’t mind the killer having spirit fury enduring. I hardly ever go for the stun anyway cause it’s risky
