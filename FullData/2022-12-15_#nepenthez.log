[2022-12-15 17:07:42] <steele1921> @andog11 Why does it matter?
[2022-12-15 17:07:53] <+MackTominay> @mikekozy23 Symfunhy is a cheater
[2022-12-15 17:07:56] <sterudd123> These are the same people who will say streamers have streamer luck even though they only open 4 packs a week themselves compared to the hundreds streamers open
[2022-12-15 17:08:08] <DeEeBoO_11> I think the 2-0 miss killed him

[2022-12-15 17:09:12] <+Packnondo> quick sorare question, do you think the national series players will eventually have value to them in the future rather than 99% of them floating at ~52p?
[2022-12-15 17:09:18] <lazvegaz79> Nep just makes it look easy. Try qualifing eith a 10k team. Not easy.
[2022-12-15 17:09:28] <+donny96> you prefer old gen gameplay then now you've played it more or you think both versions as bad as eachother?

[2022-12-15 17:10:42] <+donny96> contemplating whether to sell my team for TOTY and go untradeable
[2022-12-15 17:10:46] <DeEeBoO_11> may be he didn't mean to power shot cuz the keeper was so close and he panic
[2022-12-15 17:11:02] <@%Viperlization> @Dezalleycat good lad. shes a queen must be protected at all costs

[2022-12-15 17:18:27] <CyrixEu> Snow in my area at the moment
[2022-12-15 17:18:33] <%oxjacksonx> 5 with that team is already amazing
[2022-12-15 17:18:45] <+slang608> tbf if youd buy the game now and start playing, you only need 1 sb game for a 82+ x 20
[2022-12-15 17:18:53] <%+Cavacom> Skill issue, agreed
[2022-12-15 17:19:08] <%Dezalleycat> That’s bollox,it’s skill based match making
[2022-12-15 17:19:10] <%+markcheesyy> I'm a poor player so need my great team. but it is easy to get a decent gold team with some specials.
[2022-12-15 17:19:21] <%+Cavacom> IE. someone went 20-0 in Fut champs with all bronze players
[2022-12-15 17:19:21] <CyrixEu> I play on pc and the players are crazy
[2022-12-15 17:19:21] <jhunter123> Just play Almiron centre mid is what your opponent could do for more Chen
[2022-12-15 17:19:26] <jhunter123> Chemistry

[2022-12-15 17:22:11] <%+mikekozy23> @Jaytttttttttt 3Head logic here
[2022-12-15 17:22:29] <+sergibonga> @jaytttttttttt team is still relevant, if you get given the best team in the game you’ll go up at least 1 rank in champs
[2022-12-15 17:22:53] <+Jaytttttttttt> Ok lol
[2022-12-15 17:23:01] <%oxjacksonx> so in a chess match one guy have the chess pieces the over one has painted pebbles who wins? who ever is better at the game
[2022-12-15 17:23:04] <%hughr1983> How vlahovic been nep?

[2022-12-15 17:23:39] <%+LL_37> that ref isn't from Brazil
[2022-12-15 17:23:46] <%+mikekozy23> @Jaytttttttttt so why don't u use a full bronze team in champs? if team doesnt matter at all, you should still get 11 wins right?
[2022-12-15 17:23:58] <thewalsallswift> really enjoying seeing some different players being used might try the same myself
[2022-12-15 17:24:21] <%+stackmillz> @coys51 nah bro axel or skatez lol
[2022-12-15 17:24:29] <%Dezalleycat> @coys51 Fuckinnnell streets of rage on the mega drive was awesome
[2022-12-15 17:24:30] <+jspatch7> I used to think EA boosted my team when using lower overalls. Gameplay feels better with a worse team sometimes

[2022-12-15 17:32:26] <%+mikekozy23> @Viperlization give 4-1-3-2 a twirl, its very similar but a little wider
[2022-12-15 17:32:28] <%blazer33x> any leaks for today?
[2022-12-15 17:32:43] <dylanwall120> I’m struggling so much this fifa went from 11 wins in champs last year to 6 wins this year should I try old gen

[2022-12-15 17:33:19] <%$coys51> Orsic good for the bench
[2022-12-15 17:33:21] <timmo5098> tott
[2022-12-15 17:33:33] <+xxmickey__mousexx> livakovic then manager from that league will get orsic on chem and livakovic might get a tott
[2022-12-15 17:33:34] <%+mikekozy23> orsic would be mad at 89
[2022-12-15 17:33:41] <%jjaden10> Orsic 5* wf but maybe skill upgrade hopefully
[2022-12-15 17:33:59] <+skoreem> MOROCCO FOR THE WIN
[2022-12-15 17:34:05] <timmo5098> guys is it worth saving packs for friday?
[2022-12-15 17:34:12] <%+mikekozy23> morocco got more to fight for still, croatia probably not as worried about 3rd place
[2022-12-15 17:34:13] <airball22> Atlas lions 🦁
[2022-12-15 17:34:14] <+Connel_1411> think its a really good game

[2022-12-15 17:34:19] <%$coys51> thing Morocco will be very down after last night though
[2022-12-15 17:34:22] <%+FinnboSlice> Yo nep, if Croatia or Morocco win their game do they get an upgrade at all or are the PTG cards for them just done now?
[2022-12-15 17:34:32] <+fastfil7> The Moroccan coach said he was gonna let players that’s didn’t play, play
[2022-12-15 17:34:33] <$Dafifabomb> To Morocco 3rd place means everything where as Croatia will be abit meh
[2022-12-15 17:34:40] <%jjaden10> What day is the 3rd place game
[2022-12-15 17:34:41] <fozzrr> Spotify!
[2022-12-15 17:34:42] <+hunterrestrial> If they price Orisic at an 84 squad, everyone will have him as a supersub for awhile

[2022-12-15 17:35:13] <+drms122> Nep, the rating (87) is not official. Look at previous sherrif posts for Enzo for example. He posted him as 87 and it turned out to be 86
[2022-12-15 17:35:16] <+xxmickey__mousexx> @jjaden10 day before final

[2022-12-15 17:36:19] <%+Quilva> stick a portugal flag as his club
[2022-12-15 17:36:20] <+fastfil7> Can Boufal still get 5 skills, if they beat Croatia?

[2022-12-15 17:36:58] <DeEeBoO_11> the gold card was 1.2 mil, that falashback was cool
[2022-12-15 17:36:58] <qwizn> haha i remember that flashback ronaldo i done it
[2022-12-15 17:37:00] <+sjm501> Did they have Becks at Real Madrid? That free card a few years ago?
[2022-12-15 17:37:01] <%$coys51> 83 shooting jokes from EA lol
[2022-12-15 17:37:01] <%+niblacs> maybe portugal like dani alves etc
[2022-12-15 17:37:05] <%jjaden10> Cr6😂 I remember he was actually fun to play with
[2022-12-15 17:37:06] <+WaynesWorld20_> people will do it just to have flashback ronaldo and messi together lool
[2022-12-15 17:37:07] <mah1920> w song
[2022-12-15 17:37:14] <@%Viperlization> Anything specific for this edit
[2022-12-15 17:37:14] <%therealcathal> he tweeted again about the Badge
[2022-12-15 17:37:17] <ifbbsami> Flashback lacazette is needed
[2022-12-15 17:37:17] <+BYCakes> it would be a big shame if both that card and fb messi are rm/rw
[2022-12-15 17:37:17] <%+stackmillz> they should give him a madrid flashback if nething
[2022-12-15 17:37:18] <%+riff_hunter44> FB to when he played for United maybe lol
[2022-12-15 17:37:19] <paulallanscard> favourite TV quiz show?
[2022-12-15 17:37:20] <+calcium_77> That 🐀 isn't associated with my club anymore so no thank you

[2022-12-15 17:37:20] <+2siick87> surly they wont do a messi flashback and ronaldo same year
[2022-12-15 17:37:25] <+shortstakked> It was retweeted by sheriff so I would imagine it’s real
[2022-12-15 17:37:25] <rjones86> Side man track
[2022-12-15 17:37:30] <%byyynido> This song low key not that bad
[2022-12-15 17:37:30] <@%Viperlization> Cool pal
[2022-12-15 17:37:31] <%+taylorallen133> Tobi killed this
[2022-12-15 17:37:31] <@%Viperlization> No drama
[2022-12-15 17:37:33] <%ntblue1034> baby messi and baby cr7 for the fun
[2022-12-15 17:37:34] <@%AaronBrookes94> IIRC that flashback Ronaldo dropped around the same time as that EOAE Rooney, and everyone who did Ronny wish they did Rooney
[2022-12-15 17:37:42] <+Crooksabio> have you seen the leaks for TOTT.. there are players in that who were in promos a week ago .  no rules with cards with EA
[2022-12-15 17:37:42] <+UTDBradleyy> Maybe they’ll release it with just portugal as the club like Suarez
[2022-12-15 17:37:48] <+calcium_77> KSI killed this song
[2022-12-15 17:37:52] <@%Viperlization> I actually really like this song
[2022-12-15 17:37:52] <%Dezalleycat> that fake back card should only be a 84 rated team
[2022-12-15 17:37:53] <%jjaden10> Flashback Messi + flashback Ronaldo is pure vibes. Knowing ea they’ll both be only Rw
[2022-12-15 17:37:54] <%therealcathal> they could do it as 'World Cup' League
[2022-12-15 17:38:03] <+xxmickey__mousexx> @taylorallen133 vik aswell
[2022-12-15 17:38:04] <+jonte8877> WC flashback ronaldo maybe
[2022-12-15 17:38:44] <fordykyle1> I love messi flashback. hopefully cr7 is better than his old one
[2022-12-15 17:38:52] <%therealcathal> Bounou to Bayern to cover injured Neuer
[2022-12-15 17:38:57] <%+mikekozy23> flashback to him ghosting in the world cup maybe?
[2022-12-15 17:38:59] <+calcium_77> Whats your price Estimation on the new TOTT Gakpo
[2022-12-15 17:39:00] <@%AaronBrookes94> Unless those who made that card put Manchester United because he might end up having it like Dani Alves special card?
[2022-12-15 17:39:06] <%+RainWhenIDieKane> wtf is this song?
[2022-12-15 17:39:08] <@%Viperlization> Has Josh got the clip stuff?

[2022-12-15 17:39:17] <JEST3R92> Fifa trading romian did just tweet saying for sure isnt a man u player @NepentheZ
[2022-12-15 17:39:20] <$Mythirteen> ronaldo never played RW in his career, thats wrong, makes no sense. even EA cant be that ignorant
[2022-12-15 17:39:21] <Msjogren11> Who do you think arsenal will sign in january?
[2022-12-15 17:39:24] <CyrixEu> @RainWhenIDieKane Sidemen
[2022-12-15 17:39:25] <+UTDBradleyy> Maybe they’ll release Ronaldo like the Suarez card with just nation @nepenthez
[2022-12-15 17:39:33] <shazik192> Another disappointing day if no league sbcs
[2022-12-15 17:39:34] <%therealcathal> @Msjogren11 Mudryk confirmed
[2022-12-15 17:39:41] <%+RainWhenIDieKane> @CyrixEu makes sense
[2022-12-15 17:39:42] <fordykyle1> I forgot how will you link him
[2022-12-15 17:39:47] <%blazer33x> use this squad this weekend nep for fut champs
[2022-12-15 17:39:49] <+00_SW33TCHiiNMUSiiC__> imagine EA release flashback Ronaldo with the Chelsea badge and thats how they anounce him
[2022-12-15 17:39:49] <@%Viperlization> Is the FUTBIN part meant to be part of the video

[2022-12-15 17:59:58] <@%AaronBrookes94> I wonder if someone will go into Nick's stream saying you said League SBCs are dropping due to your title now like we got the other day for his title

[2022-12-15 18:00:49] <+BYCakes> all 3 card designs are basically the same but recoloured so I say it's fair game
[2022-12-15 18:00:50] <%+nepenthez121> nederland shudve taken arg out when they had their chance
[2022-12-15 18:00:56] <+calcium_77> Go full Eredivisie back 4 and put Pedro Marques at ST

[2022-12-15 18:05:59] <%unknownEsshole> It’s nearly Xmas and feel like the game is jus worth having fun and not rewardable for grinding
[2022-12-15 18:06:02] <+loncletoma> Just played 90 min against someone playing 5 back  and midfielders on stay back.. boring guy, just hoping for counters.. cant imagine having fun playing like that
[2022-12-15 18:06:03] <+calcium_77> I'm going to be honest this game probably breaches TOS so probs no the best playing it one stream 👀🤣
[2022-12-15 18:06:10] <%jsaps1871> Look up what happens when you pause the game on it
[2022-12-15 18:06:10] <m3elv1n> @jasha1988 who?

[2022-12-15 18:07:10] <%unknownEsshole> Way too many fifa games for cards that will never play
[2022-12-15 18:07:16] <@%AaronBrookes94> Original version or newer one I wonder
[2022-12-15 18:07:28] <%+ReeedyDZN> Yoooo
[2022-12-15 18:07:33] <+headboyjacob> I found if you at towards the edge of the box at the closest player on a corner and do 2-2.5 bars of power they do an acrobatic shot and always score
[2022-12-15 18:07:35] <+hiberrry_> dont think ive ever known a company to be so out of to uch with its comunity
[2022-12-15 18:07:42] <+headboyjacob> Aim not at

[2022-12-15 18:09:09] <+Zuboronovic> @NepentheZ Do you also encounter the missing radar issue, now that you've moved to PS4?
[2022-12-15 18:09:18] <+BYCakes> he just straight teleported out after that red card
[2022-12-15 18:09:20] <+Zuboronovic> Tends to happen in the second half
[2022-12-15 18:09:22] <$huzzgc> @saurabh_17 No fix. pc terribly optimised
[2022-12-15 18:09:34] <+pumpin_the_guns1> Just played a few games for first time in a few week. The game is shockingly bad. Passing and how the ball keeps dropping to opposition in tackles.

[2022-12-15 18:20:34] <+Zuboronovic> I got 18-2 in WL (PS4) when I used to be a Gold 2 player.

[2022-12-15 18:54:18] <rubz3n> if leakers like sheriff have access to the content before all of us, probably they will also be the first to leak the info regarding league sbcs no?
[2022-12-15 18:54:20] <%+stackmillz> u should do a video on top 10 most toxic moment on fifa 23 lol

[2022-12-15 18:55:20] <+loncletoma> the fact that league sbcs are in the game but not being released is insane
[2022-12-15 18:55:27] <%therealcathal> I think its to do with Graphic Design outsourcing
[2022-12-15 18:55:29] <iibreadl> Bateson up too

[2022-12-15 18:55:40] <$Toftern> Its probably data mining right? They can see new elements added to the game. Thats my theory as a developer at least
[2022-12-15 18:55:41] <Bret__> data mining?
[2022-12-15 18:55:43] <%+riff_hunter44> Hey is there marquee match ups tonight?

[2022-12-15 18:55:53] <joey_11_> Watch EA release Marquee Matchups and Marquee Matchups only
[2022-12-15 18:55:54] <here4rewards_> One leaker said it’s much easier than people think
[2022-12-15 18:55:55] <%+zedsladdie> How are they in the game @loncletoma ?
[2022-12-15 18:55:56] <fordykyle1> im surprised they've allowed sheriff to leak stuff for 1 year now
[2022-12-15 18:55:58] <@%+Owen_Slater> They aliens from the future who decided the best purpose for time travel was leaks

[2022-12-15 18:56:03] <Jamie602> i think they feed info to certain people to build hype, i think leaks benefit ea not hurt
[2022-12-15 18:56:04] <Defnoo> if they dont drop leauge sbcs i might have to intervene

[2022-12-15 18:56:12] <%+jjw98__> Isn’t leaking technically illegal?
[2022-12-15 18:56:13] <m4nny1403> Damn autocorrect
[2022-12-15 18:56:16] <r1chstace> do they not hire external graphics guys to design the cards etc
[2022-12-15 18:56:18] <jfar98> Can we have a reason to play the game plz EA

[2022-12-15 18:56:24] <x5noopy> Probably just EA creating hype
[2022-12-15 18:56:27] <jpompeo40> I assume it would be incredibly difficult to VA that’s probably why there aren’t a lot of data minors
[2022-12-15 18:56:28] <SaneCaeser> It's Shay who was selling Icons and TOTY's for £1800.
[2022-12-15 18:56:29] <jfar98> Give us something to grind
[2022-12-15 18:56:29] <%+gourjamz> My theory is that’s it’s linked to the source code hack that happened in fifa 21, then when it was made pucblic for free 3 months later fut sheriff started his account!
[2022-12-15 18:56:32] <jawesomes93> GTA 6 gonna be released before League SBCs

[2022-12-15 18:56:35] <%Dezalleycat> There has to be some astronomical bad thing on EAs part for me,,,it’s advertising for the hardcore fan base
[2022-12-15 18:56:35] <tacitkac> apex gets date minded all the time, ea sucks at keeping things hush hush
[2022-12-15 18:56:37] <gt1392> Why doesnt ea do something about leaks? I feel like they want leakers to hype people
[2022-12-15 18:56:43] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> To be fair, with EA, I always wear protection when theyre fing me spread21GotNothingLeft
[2022-12-15 18:56:45] <%+stackmillz> or ea leaks it themselves so the hype is more real

[2022-12-15 19:11:24] <+SonOfRachel> I don’t think contributions should be valued by the position players play, 5 goal contributions by anyone is very good

[2022-12-15 19:11:24] <%+paulyc8888> but players are selected based on how many fifa points can be sold not on performance

[2022-12-15 19:12:21] <+mal_24> Kane has more goal contributions than Alvarez and Giroud, and that's my point
[2022-12-15 19:12:23] <+connieeverafter> Richarlison, Giroud the only two better I think
[2022-12-15 19:12:24] <eminovic1907> I will never understand these kids from England. Harry Kane isn’t so good as you think

[2022-12-15 19:12:43] <AbdulTarar> you said other players with 5 goal contributions and only messi and mbappe are there, he deserves it
[2022-12-15 19:12:44] <+gsinc12345> There is just no reason Kane was near the TOTT
[2022-12-15 19:12:45] <sadtimeshuni> Kane needs to take games by the scruff of the neck more.
[2022-12-15 19:12:47] <+wirey1> I mean looking at the stats it looks like he does deserve it tbh
[2022-12-15 19:12:47] <+rajibshozib321> Sympathy for Kane
[2022-12-15 19:12:47] <aaron22200> so only the 2 most obvious players have more goal contributions then

[2022-12-15 19:13:19] <+mal_24> You're missing the point though Nep, you have to acknowledge the system he plays in. Kane in the French team would get so many more chances

[2022-12-15 19:13:34] <MajorLeeHung2> A pacey Kane is all good with me
[2022-12-15 19:13:35] <saintpxblo> Kane was in DM most the time
[2022-12-15 19:13:37] <+ZoobackHD> Saka was sensational and Jude too
[2022-12-15 19:13:38] <+SonOfRachel> I think there is a fair argument for him to be there but they’ll probably be other strikers too
[2022-12-15 19:13:39] <%+suraj672004> Goals and assists a side he jus hasn’t been the best he wasn’t bad tho
[2022-12-15 19:13:39] <lpd1996> not bad stats for a cdm to be fair
[2022-12-15 19:13:41] <+tunined> even davy klaassen got more

[2022-12-15 19:13:43] <%+ColeTrain3> I didnt think Kane should have been in if, Neps convinced me he should LUL
[2022-12-15 19:13:44] <m3elv1n> 0,40 LUL
[2022-12-15 19:13:44] <videovictore> If anyone wants a high quality football kit Dm me
[2022-12-15 19:13:47] <+bertylaaa> Not many strikers have had great tournaments tbh
[2022-12-15 19:13:50] <wockii_> Is it not foden the card on the loading screen?
[2022-12-15 19:13:50] <+RioMeahUK> Someone would think you support Arsenal... oh wait
[2022-12-15 19:13:50] <%LA__2K> Compare all other stats with top 6
[2022-12-15 19:13:51] <tylermartinx> @eminovic1907 most of them players already getting one
[2022-12-15 19:13:51] <%+theoldmanrtg7619> @dcr05 Sound a bit spotty yourself
[2022-12-15 19:13:54] <Perfect_Beast> Nep will never forgive Kane for missing pen
[2022-12-15 19:13:54] <+DenizSeason> I think EA just needed a striker from a top league
[2022-12-15 19:13:54] <healey110> Nep are we getting a team of the tournament on fifa ?
[2022-12-15 19:13:55] <+rezut_> wait has the squad been leak?
[2022-12-15 19:13:58] <+lfcjacques91> pressed send too soon 😅 was meant to say he wasn't bad, but not enough for tott
[2022-12-15 19:14:01] <AbdulTarar> this is an anti arsenal agenda lmao, he deserves it nep
[2022-12-15 19:14:03] <thelittlest2k> spirs are shit though
[2022-12-15 19:14:03] <michaelrobbo8> You’re doing too much he was definitely top 3 strikers minimum
[2022-12-15 19:14:04] <jmartin88888> yeah rag on spurs, good idea!
[2022-12-15 19:14:04] <+Zuboronovic> Who mentioned Spurs?
[2022-12-15 19:14:05] <%+xqtJack> messi with 249 passes
[2022-12-15 19:14:07] <youknowkg> no ones even mentioned spurs
[2022-12-15 19:14:09] <+jayden_joshua21> No one mentioned spurs you muppet
[2022-12-15 19:14:10] <ozvaldo1892> spursy
[2022-12-15 19:14:11] <+grem1983> Bounou confirmed
[2022-12-15 19:14:11] <+mcflex15> Spuds are crap anyway
[2022-12-15 19:14:13] <@%+DavidMNobrega> Not even top 5 English players
[2022-12-15 19:14:15] <+knaztah> 0.40 chances, 90 against 200-300, and still only have 67% on the few passes as well with 1 pen goal, dont even try say he's worth it.
[2022-12-15 19:14:16] <@%Calzuhgg> Didn't even know he played for Spurs
[2022-12-15 19:14:17] <%$LilFishFart> son was better than kane
[2022-12-15 19:14:21] <Baloswarlock> kane was crap, rashford was way better
[2022-12-15 19:14:21] <+connieeverafter> Trust nobody cares about Spurs
[2022-12-15 19:14:22] <+shaqhinds03> NO
[2022-12-15 19:14:22] <+mikejew> Griezmann's chances created per 90... wow insane
[2022-12-15 19:14:24] <+Mooman07> No
[2022-12-15 19:14:25] <curtisc_134> maguire is getting  that card
[2022-12-15 19:14:26] <abtahi28> whos in the tott?
[2022-12-15 19:14:27] <%+LukeOW96> Spurs are irrelavent
[2022-12-15 19:14:29] <%+stackmillz> lets juss say rice, bellingham, and saka were the best players for england
[2022-12-15 19:14:29] <+johnnyw40> No absolutely not
[2022-12-15 19:14:30] <shinkarchannel> True that not even top 5 strikers
[2022-12-15 19:14:30] <ovowalt> based on his performance in the tournament
[2022-12-15 19:14:30] <+connieeverafter> Maguire should get in
[2022-12-15 19:14:31] <+Icebox30> I don’t think he deserves one But does foden deserve it more than him
[2022-12-15 19:14:31] <+RioMeahUK> And the answer is yes. But others also deserve one
[2022-12-15 19:14:32] <+gsinc12345> what does Spurs have to do with it ? If you can't cant see how poor Kane was then your the problem not anyone else.    He was bang average at best
[2022-12-15 19:14:35] <%KC_Runz> Nobody ever mentions Spurs tbh, washed Club LUL
[2022-12-15 19:14:35] <healey110> Is foden getting one ?
[2022-12-15 19:14:36] <@%+DavidMNobrega> He was super solid vs France but that was it
[2022-12-15 19:14:37] <MickeysIce> give to Slabhead... deserved.
[2022-12-15 19:14:37] <darsanpatel> he is not good enough
[2022-12-15 19:14:38] <+dandervaaart> As a fordward Saka was way better
[2022-12-15 19:14:41] <MajorLeeHung2> Kane is great just missed
[2022-12-15 19:14:42] <vibesfc_> Are we anti City then for saying Foden doesn't deserve it LUL
[2022-12-15 19:14:43] <thelittlest2k> foden was shite also
[2022-12-15 19:14:43] <%+nepenthez121> Maybe aside from saka & bellingham he was
[2022-12-15 19:14:43] <jkf_3110> not even the best striker for his club💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀 richarlison been better
[2022-12-15 19:14:43] <Wilza87> English players ahead of him saka, Bellingham and Maguire!
[2022-12-15 19:14:43] <%blazer33x> does folden?
[2022-12-15 19:14:47] <%$coys51> what England players deserves it no he imo
[2022-12-15 19:14:47] <%+bondy1993> if phenoms cards cant get one then he gets it
[2022-12-15 19:14:48] <lpd1996> i rate kane in the spurs squad tbh just what he does for spurs dont work for England
[2022-12-15 19:14:48] <jasha1988> japan and Morocco players deserves more
[2022-12-15 19:14:50] <+SonOfRachel> Blame EA for their rules on promo guys
[2022-12-15 19:14:50] <ItsSmolBrain> maguire deserve one TriHard
[2022-12-15 19:14:52] <%$LilFishFart> parry pane imo
[2022-12-15 19:14:53] <%$blublud84> Maguire more deserving of a card
[2022-12-15 19:14:54] <+knaztah> Even Maguire is more deserved
[2022-12-15 19:14:54] <corny009> sells packs for casuals and that is it lol
[2022-12-15 19:14:54] <georgeafc9> Kane scored 2 pens that’s it
[2022-12-15 19:14:55] <%+theoldmanrtg7619> Bellingham Maguire
[2022-12-15 19:14:55] <%$cc1883fc> how many of the others have had promo cards during the WC though?
[2022-12-15 19:14:56] <$Dafifabomb> They choose the wrong Harry for tott
[2022-12-15 19:14:58] <+mal_24> Look at the system he was playing in, once again no-one created chances for Kane. Kane did not miss a single chance
[2022-12-15 19:14:58] <+DenizSeason> jude maguire and saka
[2022-12-15 19:14:58] <ozvaldo1892> valencia was better
[2022-12-15 19:14:58] <+f4natiq> Saka ?
[2022-12-15 19:14:58] <shinkarchannel> Richarlison has more goals
[2022-12-15 19:14:58] <%$LilFishFart> rashford saka
[2022-12-15 19:14:58] <+DameFM> jude, harr
[2022-12-15 19:14:58] <+Uzayr_Shaikh> and he missed that pen as well
[2022-12-15 19:14:58] <+koojababy10> He wasn’t even the best Tottenham striker this tournament 🤣🤣
[2022-12-15 19:14:59] <+cabraljose1998> Richarlison was class
[2022-12-15 19:15:00] <tylermartinx> maguire saka jude
[2022-12-15 19:15:01] <%+suraj672004> Debate over chill

[2022-12-15 19:15:05] <+mal_24> Who created a chance for Kane?
[2022-12-15 19:15:06] <%+ReazMimic> richarlison was better and hes a spurs player
[2022-12-15 19:15:06] <%+stackmillz> rice
[2022-12-15 19:15:06] <Tityi99> So True
[2022-12-15 19:15:06] <+korpr> facts

[2022-12-15 19:15:07] <mr_bossfc1> icl if u anyone thinks kane is overrated ur on something, if anything he's underrated LUL if u watched all the England games u would know he wasn't bad at all just didn't score many goals
[2022-12-15 19:15:07] <+mikejew> Saka, Rashford and Bellingham
[2022-12-15 19:15:07] <thelittlest2k> bellingham saka pickford imo
[2022-12-15 19:15:08] <jkf_3110> saka bellingham maguire
[2022-12-15 19:15:09] <+dandervaaart> Jude and Saka

[2022-12-15 19:15:10] <+gsinc12345> Rashford also had good impact
[2022-12-15 19:15:11] <DodzRD> bellingham only person english player that deserves it
[2022-12-15 19:15:12] <Wilza87> snap! 😂
[2022-12-15 19:15:12] <%+stonemonster25> it has to be saka
[2022-12-15 19:15:12] <+sandersjs> 100% agree
[2022-12-15 19:15:13] <+adamleggy> rashford?
[2022-12-15 19:15:13] <+grem1983> just EA trying make Kane a viable card for ppl to use
[2022-12-15 19:15:13] <+knaztah> Maguire, Rashford, Saka, Bellingham is by far more deserving.
[2022-12-15 19:15:14] <%+nepenthez121> 85 pace maguire I would cream
[2022-12-15 19:15:15] <shinkarchannel> Rashford
[2022-12-15 19:15:15] <%+notgravityeu> Bellingham, Maguire, saka pickford
[2022-12-15 19:15:16] <%jjaden10> Rice was great
[2022-12-15 19:15:16] <michaelrobbo8> Giroud had a World Cup stories card so it had to be Kane or Alvarez
[2022-12-15 19:15:16] <canez95> Pickford too imo
[2022-12-15 19:15:17] <%+bondy1993> i dont think phenoms can get them
[2022-12-15 19:15:17] <%+Quilva> Bellingham, Saka and Maguire best by far
[2022-12-15 19:15:17] <+connieeverafter> Finally someone who knows Mags is a baller
[2022-12-15 19:15:18] <+mcflex15> Rashford possibly
[2022-12-15 19:15:18] <notnotspartans0453> Pickford too
[2022-12-15 19:15:19] <madman24777> Facts
[2022-12-15 19:15:20] <+f4natiq> slabhead pog
[2022-12-15 19:15:20] <shembadingo> Maguire Saka Bellingham, you could chuck in rice as well
[2022-12-15 19:15:21] <+Uzayr_Shaikh> stone
[2022-12-15 19:15:21] <+johnnyw40> Bellingham, saka and Maguire & Henderson to a degree
[2022-12-15 19:15:21] <+csgopup98> Henderson was better than Kane honestly
[2022-12-15 19:15:21] <MickeysIce> Slabhead
[2022-12-15 19:15:22] <+Fatjack96> rashford over saka for me
[2022-12-15 19:15:23] <+smituation1234> Henderson
[2022-12-15 19:15:23] <%$LilFishFart> if rashford started against france
[2022-12-15 19:15:23] <%+sknvbj> rashford too but he didnt play enough
[2022-12-15 19:15:24] <paulsoumik12> correct nep
[2022-12-15 19:15:24] <healey110> Why would they give maguire to me , no one would use him
[2022-12-15 19:15:25] <%nykchazzaa> shouldnt do a tott if they arent willing to give last weeks promo cards another one
[2022-12-15 19:15:25] <+ward24> I was about to say maguire was one of the better ones
[2022-12-15 19:15:25] <lpd1996> Maguire/jude/rashford and saka
[2022-12-15 19:15:26] <%+joshua12012000> rashford
[2022-12-15 19:15:27] <+rezut_> Bono better get one
[2022-12-15 19:15:27] <nouman_07> Rashford
[2022-12-15 19:15:27] <%simonasken> Rashford for sure
[2022-12-15 19:15:28] <+healtheekid> Agree 100%
[2022-12-15 19:15:29] <%$coys51> Bellingham only one
[2022-12-15 19:15:29] <rsmith314> Do fifa not release an official team of the tournament themselves?
[2022-12-15 19:15:29] <%Frog1786> Rashford did well for what he was allowed to play
[2022-12-15 19:15:29] <%+notgravityeu> Pigford
[2022-12-15 19:15:30] <nouman_07> 4th
[2022-12-15 19:15:31] <tylermartinx> why are people saying rash aha barely played
[2022-12-15 19:15:31] <Stallone986> lewy>>>>>>>
[2022-12-15 19:15:33] <+knaztah> Rashford is mucn more worthy
[2022-12-15 19:15:33] <flyer2004> True Maguire looked like a leader
[2022-12-15 19:15:33] <mrpotinho> maybe even En-Nesyri would be ahead of Kane
[2022-12-15 19:15:35] <+Hardiboy436> Is there a full tott
[2022-12-15 19:15:35] <%+ironvine34> Saka so overrated man
[2022-12-15 19:15:35] <ItsSmolBrain> maguire and best in the same sentence is so funny LUL
[2022-12-15 19:15:36] <KingAustin> i wonder if alvarez gets the showdown card for the final
[2022-12-15 19:15:37] <+RioMeahUK> Rashford scored 3 goals but otherwise did nothing
[2022-12-15 19:15:38] <+sandersjs> 100000% agree with you nep
[2022-12-15 19:15:39] <mr_bossfc1> John stones was great aswell tbf
[2022-12-15 19:15:40] <+Ryan_3366> Shaw was better than Maguire, Maguire was the reason for a goal against Iran and lost his man in the France game
[2022-12-15 19:15:40] <+joshua9320> Saka bias
[2022-12-15 19:15:41] <%Benz_soloelite1> I think these types of players just have to have cards
[2022-12-15 19:15:41] <shembadingo> Stones weren’t bad as well
[2022-12-15 19:15:41] <%+theoldmanrtg7619> Henderson  is a shout to be fair also
[2022-12-15 19:15:42] <+healtheekid> Saka was levels
[2022-12-15 19:15:42] <daramrebels> Are there league
[2022-12-15 19:15:45] <%oxjacksonx> cards like this are predetermined like you was saying yesterday ea put who ever they want not who deserves it
[2022-12-15 19:15:45] <+mal_24> Maguire should have stopped the Giroud goal, Bellingham didn't close down the ball for the first goal
[2022-12-15 19:15:46] <canez95> They limited their options by including players in the other dumb promos
[2022-12-15 19:15:48] <supermercadotelebancos> Rashford was also very good. Especially with the time he got. @nepenthez
[2022-12-15 19:15:51] <+adrian530520> Saka was great!
[2022-12-15 19:15:53] <%$coys51> saka gave the ball away more than anyone lol
[2022-12-15 19:15:53] <+SCF08onFIFA> Looks bad on them as well for non FIFA players
[2022-12-15 19:15:53] <michaelrobbo8> Giroud had a World Cup stories card so it had to be either Kane or Alvarez in TOTT
[2022-12-15 19:15:54] <vibesfc_> @tylermartinx Because he balled out when he was allowed to actually play
[2022-12-15 19:15:54] <%+nepenthez121> FUT meant to reflect real life
[2022-12-15 19:15:55] <neil1989> they never do the same cards 2 weeeks on the trot , they never have
[2022-12-15 19:15:55] <%+stackmillz> pickford did have a good tourny aswell
[2022-12-15 19:15:56] <@%+Owen_Slater> Phenoms by definition were breakthrough players, so it should be expected to be in TOTT
[2022-12-15 19:15:57] <%+kapcio97> saka 😭 walker-bellingham and maguire were standouts
[2022-12-15 19:15:57] <jasha1988> cuz Maguire, Saka and Belingham was the best plasers they are home now
[2022-12-15 19:15:59] <lpd1996> pickford had a better wc than kane
[2022-12-15 19:16:06] <spurs18smith> Spurs fan here, he played well but he wasn’t even the best striker from spurs at the World Cup
[2022-12-15 19:16:10] <+mattbrown2019> It’s like they picked their TOTT back in October 😂😂😂
[2022-12-15 19:16:10] <abtahi28> is the rumors of fb ronaldo true
[2022-12-15 19:16:13] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> Shocking
[2022-12-15 19:16:15] <jmartin88888> but then the tiktok kids won't use mommy's credit card for fifa points
[2022-12-15 19:16:15] <tylermartinx> @vibesfc_ that aint tott worthy mate is it
[2022-12-15 19:16:17] <%+LukeOW96> Wish I did Acuna ffs
[2022-12-15 19:16:17] <healey110> What do u think of Saka Phenom card , bang average ?
[2022-12-15 19:16:21] <+FluxxyKarmah> they pick whatever sells packs
[2022-12-15 19:16:24] <8RIGHTS> i think the other half of the reason is alot of those players that should get one over kan will get TOTY's
[2022-12-15 19:16:24] <+connieeverafter> Hakimi, Mags, Gvardiol, Shaw, Amrabat, Bruno, Modric, Mbappe, Messi, Giroud
[2022-12-15 19:16:27] <+theirishbeardedpirate> They give cards to the same players all the time yet won't do it when it's performanced based.
[2022-12-15 19:16:28] <%$coys51> all about money from ea
[2022-12-15 19:16:32] <shembadingo> So what we doing now nep in terms of Fifa
[2022-12-15 19:16:34] <vibesfc_> @tylermartinx Nobody said Tott they said England's best performers
[2022-12-15 19:16:37] <+johnnyw40> Richarlison was better then Kane
[2022-12-15 19:16:38] <%+xqtJack> hows enzo??
[2022-12-15 19:16:38] <jumbojack03> Why can ea not base there tott on the actual tott?
[2022-12-15 19:16:40] <+SCF08onFIFA> Imagine all non FIFA players or actual pro footballers looking at that selection. They think EA is an joke. Bad marketing.
[2022-12-15 19:16:42] <+duffy97> Griezmann has to make the team
[2022-12-15 19:16:43] <abtahi28> nep you had token packs but i dont in the store
[2022-12-15 19:16:48] <flyer2004> What we’re the showdowns today nep

[2022-12-15 19:16:55] <MickeysIce> let us have a TOTT Giroud
[2022-12-15 19:16:58] <%+theoldmanrtg7619> @abtahi28 Make that up yourself lol
[2022-12-15 19:16:58] <+1predz> Lane will get ea more money in terms of ppl wanting to open packs

[2022-12-15 19:17:03] <%+Surrengar> Do you think the swaps tokens are over?
[2022-12-15 19:17:07] <seifyoussef51> what do u think about vlahovic is he worth it?
[2022-12-15 19:17:09] <larjokoe> i feel like english, prem and french players will be most of the TOTT cause they sell the most packs  although "smaller" nations deserve it way more
[2022-12-15 19:17:09] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> Honestly, the entitlement of some of those replies to the Draft post are really disheartening. Like who is that desperate for a draft video?
[2022-12-15 19:17:11] <grantwilson> See tbh I have no drive to even play Fifa right now
[2022-12-15 19:17:14] <8RIGHTS> giroud should have got a tott even tho i hate him
[2022-12-15 19:17:15] <%+stackmillz> suprised felix hasnt gotten a card
[2022-12-15 19:17:17] <+adrian530520> I’m just qualifying for champs today and I’m out
[2022-12-15 19:17:22] <%+ironvine34> Aboubakar was better than Kane according to this chat
[2022-12-15 19:17:24] <urunclesulcer> I'd love some sbcs to grind
[2022-12-15 19:17:25] <+johnnyw40> Vlahovic is a beast
[2022-12-15 19:17:29] <abtahi28> nah the fb ronaldo leak is with the tott cards unless itsjust rumors
[2022-12-15 19:17:33] <HD74LiF3> What’s the 6pm content????
[2022-12-15 19:17:35] <@%+Owen_Slater> Shouldnt it be excpected that phenoms make TOTT, given they are "breakthrough players" as per their release
[2022-12-15 19:17:35] <%The_Nines_> I must’ve missed a store token stuck on 39 and nothin else available
[2022-12-15 19:17:36] <+mrmcgee96> no new content today then?
[2022-12-15 19:17:42] <+mal_24> Surely a Ronaldo TOTT would be worse than Kane
[2022-12-15 19:17:45] <IsWeGood> should i open my back or wait for tomorrow?
[2022-12-15 19:17:46] <fungafufu> league sbc today?
[2022-12-15 19:17:51] <%+nepenthez121> aguerd might make me do yamiq now I'm running 4 moroccans in my team now

[2022-12-15 19:17:58] <corny009> i'm guessing more tokens in packs tomorrow at 6
[2022-12-15 19:17:59] <+johnnyw40> Guessing there was nothing but World Cup marquee matchups?
[2022-12-15 19:17:59] <+Gworv> lightning rounds used to be over fast, hence the term lightning
[2022-12-15 19:18:05] <%+clanwalk3r> the HT challenge for the WC giving a two player pack is absolute jokes 😂
[2022-12-15 19:18:07] <+Icebox30> Would have been nice to see some of the OZ boys get a TOTT and not just the same old
[2022-12-15 19:18:11] <%+RfcHarry07> whats your thoughts about the showdowns?
[2022-12-15 19:18:11] <%$darwinswift> First time in ultimate team I’ve got bored an given up before team of the year
[2022-12-15 19:18:12] <+knaztah> Just by getting Kane that special card shows how little EA really know about ball
[2022-12-15 19:18:14] <%+derrickp_13> i love this amazing amazing content
[2022-12-15 19:18:22] <plebalertx> yamiq and aguerd could be a good cb partnership
[2022-12-15 19:18:24] <%+stonemonster25> we scored 9 goals in the group stage and kane was only involved in 3 of them goals for me he doesn't deserve to be in team of the tournament.
[2022-12-15 19:18:30] <Stallone986> nep who is the best striker for about 500k?

[2022-12-15 19:18:44] <+Gworv> @icebox30 were they the best players?
[2022-12-15 19:18:55] <+rajibshozib321> I think Ea are becoming more predictable (content releases) and also the game is just becoming too repetitive with no variation .

[2022-12-15 19:55:11] <VladyB19> If there was something like Dota vs LOL it would be alot better
[2022-12-15 19:55:11] <+BotBill32> Feels better when the BS is for you than against you though.
[2022-12-15 19:55:22] <arzhard> Sniper on vlad whaaaaat
[2022-12-15 19:55:25] <filthyweazel> The feeling that you do everything right in the game and his keeper literally saves anything, he get one chance and scores. Thats me. Thats why i stopped playing rivals
[2022-12-15 19:55:35] <+Zuboronovic> It's Christmas time. Call him Vla-ho-ho-ho-vic.
[2022-12-15 19:55:41] <azeem453> On another day potentially this guy would’ve scored more
[2022-12-15 19:55:53] <%+nepenthez121> too many repeat songs atm nep
[2022-12-15 19:55:54] <%+ray_rockwood> Nep have you tried PTG Boufal since the 5 * weak foot upgrade? First time I've appreciated a med/low work rate on a striker since Balotelli on FIFA 13.

[2022-12-15 19:58:00] <+ragingrhino48> Is capdevila worth spending 500k on!?
[2022-12-15 19:58:00] <arzhard> @abzz111 Enzo
[2022-12-15 19:58:04] <filthyweazel> @VladyB19 yeah and ea know very well they have all the power so nothing will ever change, until they notice a relapse in income.
[2022-12-15 19:58:08] <%+stackmillz> is so funny walking away for like 10 mins and coming back hearing nep telling sum kid off lmao never gets old
[2022-12-15 19:58:16] <%cstredder> When do you think you’ll stop playing Fifa nep
[2022-12-15 19:58:20] <+theirishbeardedpirate> He thought he was listening to Djnepo instead of Neppo
[2022-12-15 19:58:32] <+gucciheadband11> Gg bro I was watching ur video when I started the match bro big ups
[2022-12-15 19:58:36] <%mbesh> I bought Virgil after you said El-Yamiq is basically most of his cost and he is so OP
[2022-12-15 19:58:47] <abzz111> @arzhard what do you mean ?
[2022-12-15 19:58:57] <euan1456> Is Phemons Vlahovic any good?
[2022-12-15 19:59:13] <arzhard> @abzz111 Enzo Fernandez is the guy you don’t need viera
[2022-12-15 19:59:20] <VladyB19> What formation was the guy playing
[2022-12-15 19:59:26] <filthyweazel> I hear everyone say Enzo is amazing but he feels stiff for me
[2022-12-15 19:59:30] <+gucciheadband11> I was using 4312 bro
[2022-12-15 19:59:34] <+james8500051> This Enzo is my fav card at the min. Runs the midfield!
[2022-12-15 19:59:39] <abzz111> Oh !!! Tooo late for Enzo
[2022-12-15 19:59:39] <+b3n1999> Nep I just packed a turquoise Man City badge and it quick sells for 2.4K what is this?
[2022-12-15 19:59:43] <abzz111> He isn’t available anymore
[2022-12-15 19:59:48] <abzz111> Viera still available
[2022-12-15 19:59:49] <%$LilFishFart> like create a more in depth player profile
[2022-12-15 19:59:53] <iDersch> @abzz111 if you've done all the objectives already, there is no way to get 20 more tokens
[2022-12-15 19:59:56] <VladyB19> BloodTrail
[2022-12-15 20:00:03] <+Zuboronovic> I wonder how accurate those stats are
[2022-12-15 20:00:07] <%Post_FUT_Clarity> @abzz111 too late for Vieira too mate
[2022-12-15 20:00:10] <arzhard> @abzz111 The swap Fabinho?
[2022-12-15 20:00:11] <+b3n1999> Or does anyone here know??
[2022-12-15 20:00:21] <%+ray_rockwood> I will laugh if on the last day of World Cup mode EA sells 50 swap tokens for 130,000 FIFA points.
[2022-12-15 20:00:28] <abzz111> @idersch fair play. There were couple of swap tokens in packs so thought maybe more coming
[2022-12-15 20:00:31] <%$J1___> is a low driven just low power?
[2022-12-15 20:00:33] <+danny_kivokid> how do you do low drivens again?
[2022-12-15 20:00:42] <+b3n1999> Nep I just packed a turquoise Man City badge and it quick sells for 2.4K what is this? Or anyone know?

[2022-12-15 20:00:48] <Reetwik> nep how is aguerd?
[2022-12-15 20:00:50] <+WannabeGamerKayKay> Any idea why cr7 rulebreaker just dropped like 60k in the last hour?
[2022-12-15 20:00:51] <iDersch> @abzz111 nah i think its only 2 or 3 that come in packs.
[2022-12-15 20:01:05] <Makezuu1> just tap shoot button for low driven
[2022-12-15 20:01:19] <Bsamanta> Get lautaro
[2022-12-15 20:01:32] <+gucciheadband11> Ggs bro just played you
[2022-12-15 20:01:34] <%mbesh> it sucks that low driven works so well because it's so unsatisfying to see a slow roller go into the net
[2022-12-15 20:01:44] <abzz111> I’m just gonna use path to glory brazovic and use tokens to do player pick path to glory and see what happens
[2022-12-15 20:01:57] <Bsamanta> neppoGG
[2022-12-15 20:02:03] <+fawkes6191> You reckon any World Cup icons are gonna be in packs tomorrow ?

[2022-12-15 20:02:08] <+b3n1999> Nep I just packed a turquoise Man City badge and it quick sells for 2.4K what is this?
[2022-12-15 20:02:14] <+gucciheadband11> Ye I know man I was watching your video at the start of the game and went into the stream
[2022-12-15 20:02:17] <+gucciheadband11> I stop at 11
[2022-12-15 20:02:19] <+gucciheadband11> Div 2
[2022-12-15 20:02:21] <blinkersarmy> Theres no point getting past 11 wins imo
[2022-12-15 20:02:25] <jeagerist03> i swear there was a other way to do low driven outside of only shoot with low power.
[2022-12-15 20:02:25] <filthyweazel> Yeah Nep you know what that turquoize Man City badge is? I packed it today too
[2022-12-15 20:02:27] <willshire232323> Remember fifa 17 when the low driven was op. Just double tap shoot and you scored every time
[2022-12-15 20:02:29] <reyizhan6> i thought you were doing an sbb against aj3 with the title i was confused
[2022-12-15 20:02:32] <rpc84> fut sheriff tweet
[2022-12-15 20:02:40] <+b3n1999> For any reason lol?

[2022-12-15 20:02:47] <+gucciheadband11> Na I can’t get into div 1
[2022-12-15 20:02:48] <%+ray_rockwood> If you didn't do Vieira for the 40 swap tokens you fell for EA's tricks.
[2022-12-15 20:03:00] <+gucciheadband11> How do you do low drivens I’m so bad at shooting
[2022-12-15 20:03:07] <afc_hird> Nep, packed mid dinho a few days ago, do you reckon i should sell him?
[2022-12-15 20:03:11] <%mbesh> @gucciheadband11 tap shoot

[2022-12-15 20:03:36] <+BotBill32> F the elite division, makes friendlies and swaps so bad to do and time consuming, every game is a total sweat fest as if your playing for 20-0
[2022-12-15 20:03:45] <sniperpanda777yt> IS PARADES GOOD???? 87 rated
[2022-12-15 20:03:45] <willshire232323> I face a lot of players in div 3 that should be in elite.
[2022-12-15 20:03:45] <abzz111> I’m stuck in DiV 4 for a week now - my every pass gets intercepted and opposition is always on top of me through out the whole 90 minutes -____-
[2022-12-15 20:03:49] <gallo_lowks> Yamiq Aguerd hybrid inc?

[2022-12-15 20:04:24] <%+ray_rockwood> @danthewolvesfan look at what most people got in the 84x20s or World Cup Icons pick or even PTG pick!
[2022-12-15 20:04:25] <%theJFKexperience0> It stopped being a road to glory when everything in the game became untradeable
[2022-12-15 20:04:28] <filthyweazel> Im on old gen too
[2022-12-15 20:04:32] <blinkersarmy> Try win the PlayStation tournaments

[2022-12-15 20:04:42] <ItsSmolBrain> at least your honest TriHard
[2022-12-15 20:04:44] <+torreira112335> watching you play with any player and make super interesting teams is unreal so id be so in favour of you adding fifa points on
[2022-12-15 20:04:46] <+M4N5F1ELD_> Im staying in Div 1 next season I hate elite not worth it for the little better rewards
[2022-12-15 20:04:47] <+gucciheadband11> Acuna and endo are honestly insane
[2022-12-15 20:04:55] <%+kingnovakin> ps4 too I think for tornaments

[2022-12-15 20:05:20] <%+aniron123> how's Felix been playing for athletico though ?
[2022-12-15 20:05:21] <Tazza_G_97> how low do we reckon Messi rttk will go? he's about 1mil now
[2022-12-15 20:05:21] <%cstredder> Arsenal are a banter club
[2022-12-15 20:05:22] <+gucciheadband11> He was so overlooked imo nobody was raving about him
[2022-12-15 20:05:25] <%theJFKexperience0> Road to glory was cool like 3 or 4 years ago when untradeable first owner meant something
[2022-12-15 20:05:30] <Bsamanta> What’s tomorrow???
[2022-12-15 20:05:31] <willshire232323> I loved the Vlahovic review vid. Defo need more like that.

[2022-12-15 20:07:12] <Makezuu1> ye Acuna and Enzo are very good midfielders . Best sbc done so far in this fifa. These 2 are example how sbc should be. Not expensive and actually good.

[2022-12-15 20:27:28] <%+whufcconnor> ive been free to play for a year not won a single football limited but its so enjoyable following leagues you'd never think of
[2022-12-15 20:27:35] <%+ray_rockwood> I don't play SoRare because I don't know much about all those smaller leagues, but I enjoy your content on it.
[2022-12-15 20:27:54] <%+rickd96> dont get it. got a custom series. got offered €2,50 while most sold for 0,61
[2022-12-15 20:28:03] <%sorarejosh> can u show it?
[2022-12-15 20:28:14] <trippyerror> @pgsteel21 those world cup pps are so annoying especially when an 125k pack isn't a walkout

[2022-12-15 20:30:31] <%+ray_rockwood> Sounds like that bundle is actually a slight deal. SoRare is actually legit

[2022-12-15 20:36:03] <@%Witchwalker70> I got a survey from Sorare today asking if I liked the global cup and if I would like to see more
[2022-12-15 20:36:12] <%$nathjasper95> Hope we actually get some juices showdown cards for the final.. everyone hates GKs but be nice to see both GKs and a striker from both teams get one
[2022-12-15 20:36:20] <AbdulTarar> when does the academy open up?

[2022-12-15 20:40:46] <+Remizzle> time to start playing fifa CLUB
[2022-12-15 20:40:49] <+TMaier10> the problem is rivals, there is no incentive to keep playing the only mode that you can grind
[2022-12-15 20:40:57] <MeisterNes> Nick chilling in Witcher 3, maybe try out another game for a bit?
[2022-12-15 20:41:00] <%Bradc118> Evening neppo and chat
[2022-12-15 20:41:03] <%+Kieran96cfc> is there no other games you want to play or you want to play just FIFA?
[2022-12-15 20:41:12] <%+Lescs04> Miss the just grinding League SBC whilst blasting some tunes Streams...
[2022-12-15 20:41:18] <%+ray_rockwood> Pull up some of your old videos when FIFA was fun and react to them on stream. I love when you do that. Takes us all back.
[2022-12-15 20:41:22] <princehairry> yeah we don't like playing the game either LUL
[2022-12-15 20:41:52] <simpeleziel1981> same here, usually i have about 1250 to 1500 games this time of fifa. now i just hit my 700th game
[2022-12-15 20:41:57] <%+mikeybish2020> i did pack linekar from the 78+ though so all good.
[2022-12-15 20:42:49] <fordykyle1> pie playing fut champs lol
[2022-12-15 20:42:58] <fordykyle1> ps5
[2022-12-15 20:42:59] <%$J1___> ps5 im sure
[2022-12-15 20:43:02] <+smokeymcpot_99> Xbox
[2022-12-15 20:43:03] <%+whufcconnor> xbox series x
[2022-12-15 20:43:08] <%+mikeybish2020> ive gone back to Xbox old gen
[2022-12-15 20:43:10] <@%+DavidMNobrega> You know what, gameplay wise this might be the best FIFA ever no cap, everyone seems to say it's "decent" including myself
[2022-12-15 20:43:10] <%$J1___> or new gen yeah
[2022-12-15 20:43:11] <%+whufcconnor> he play new gen
[2022-12-15 20:43:17] <ext1mple> Brothers if i already got the 4600 points from ea play, will i get them again if i buy full ultimate edition now?
[2022-12-15 20:43:22] <%Bullardiniho> I've tried to stay away from going back to old gen.. would you say its like last year in terms of PS4 version being clear?
[2022-12-15 20:43:32] <blinkersarmy> sbmm ruined fifa
[2022-12-15 20:43:44] <here4rewards_> Corners and step overs are the only crazy broken things atm
[2022-12-15 20:43:58] <+StevenHartley> 21 was awful with those directional nutmegs
[2022-12-15 20:43:59] <%$blublud84> El Tornado was the worst
[2022-12-15 20:44:37] <%+brendanmcd8> things now are overpowered - not broken this year it feels
[2022-12-15 20:44:45] <%+kingnovakin> I agree, gameplay is not too bad. But every game is so sweaty every game has to be competitive, sometimes I want to chill but can't
[2022-12-15 20:44:51] <Zolious> i lag every fucking game
[2022-12-15 20:44:54] <+ikester213> having my defenders sliding around my box like an ice rink is an issue
[2022-12-15 20:44:56] <+saintjimmy1122> I think it’s the most balanced it’s ever been.
[2022-12-15 20:45:05] <+BronzeWorld> i personaly love this gameplay, the balance
[2022-12-15 20:45:10] <+BronzeWorld> compared to other games
[2022-12-15 20:45:11] <yungmaseyy> @zolious That’s probably your connection tho
[2022-12-15 20:45:22] <+Pelycaan> nah gameplays dog rn
[2022-12-15 20:45:25] <%Bullardiniho> so much time in and very little back
[2022-12-15 20:45:26] <+Zuboronovic> It's one of my favourite FIFAs
[2022-12-15 20:45:31] <%+Brandez84> I think gameplay was better prior to patch but still isn’t too bad
[2022-12-15 20:45:31] <SorryiBeatyouXD> Why am I concededing stupid goals it’s shocking
[2022-12-15 20:45:35] <+Pelycaan> everyone just trades
[2022-12-15 20:45:36] <AJJRiow> We’ve had better menus content in the past
[2022-12-15 20:45:48] <eye4dtails> The passing is terrible
[2022-12-15 20:45:49] <yungmaseyy> I feel like Moments could’ve been executed so much better
[2022-12-15 20:46:19] <+giuseppe_esq> I want to play football, not open 500 player pick packs
[2022-12-15 20:46:20] <+Pelycaan> black Friday was so fun
[2022-12-15 20:46:23] <%+brendanmcd8> if they are scared of league SBCs  and the impact on the market - idk why they dont just say you can only finish each league 1 or 2 times a day
[2022-12-15 20:46:29] <+smokeymcpot_99> It’s about money
[2022-12-15 20:46:30] <%Bullardiniho> Agreed
[2022-12-15 20:46:34] <Makezuu1> moneyy
[2022-12-15 20:46:42] <%Bradc118> Can we talk about how bad those pp are for pie lol
[2022-12-15 20:47:19] <MakaChaka> Screw EA bro...
[2022-12-15 20:47:48] <%Bullardiniho> I don't know why they haven't added upgradeable cards through objectives like they do on 2k - Collection cards etc...
[2022-12-15 20:48:20] <MakaChaka> Who is streaming? Im getting dizzy ehre? xD
[2022-12-15 20:48:23] <MakaChaka> here*
[2022-12-15 20:48:27] <%Bradc118> Also love the elf updates buddy you and the fam ready for Xmas?
[2022-12-15 20:48:30] <MakaChaka> Oh It was utube I see

[2022-12-15 20:48:44] <MakaChaka> @mikeybish2020 XD
[2022-12-15 20:48:56] <%+mikeybish2020> phew
[2022-12-15 20:49:05] <%+mikeybish2020> he aint breathing
[2022-12-15 20:49:13] <%$lfcplz> we need more objectives of things like scoring with a certain nation or club in 25 rivals games, but for rewards that are actually worth it
[2022-12-15 20:49:15] <Tugrul2021> any decent pulls @nepenthez
[2022-12-15 20:49:19] <+Peter_TM> @mikeybish2020 youll figure it out LUL
[2022-12-15 20:49:20] <+Zuboronovic> What's the average time that people spend on FUT?
[2022-12-15 20:49:21] <+Pelycaan> its crazy how league sbcs aren't out yet
[2022-12-15 20:49:26] <+Zuboronovic> per day
[2022-12-15 20:49:41] <%+mikeybish2020> i reckon 60% of the game is played in the menus.....
[2022-12-15 20:49:41] <simpeleziel1981> 3 hours playing was fun, now after each win i will go and look what i need next. it's completly changed
[2022-12-15 20:49:53] <+Peter_TM> After my 8 wins in Rivals, maybe an hour a day @Zuboronovic
[2022-12-15 20:50:13] <ThomasSheppard11> @mikeybish2020 ye
[2022-12-15 20:50:17] <%$blublud84> yep
[2022-12-15 20:50:23] <nc_99> Thats why everything is cheap, cus theres no coins
[2022-12-15 20:50:49] <yungmaseyy> @nc_99 Nah it’s literally the opposite lol
[2022-12-15 20:50:58] <RileyyyOnTTV> If you don’t pack it, you don’t get it
[2022-12-15 20:51:03] <+TheCulchie101> @nc
[2022-12-15 20:51:03] <keanosarmy16> MM is our only source of coinage
[2022-12-15 20:51:06] <+jbfut_> @Zuboronovic 4-6hrs a day. im a trader tho
[2022-12-15 20:51:07] <+Kollek92> @yungmaseyy explain
[2022-12-15 20:51:08] <nc_99> @yungmaseyy if theres a good amount of coins, cards would become expensive
[2022-12-15 20:51:16] <MakaChaka> ALL they want is you to buy points man. This game is pay to win. Its a shame football is such a beautiful game and they have ruined it.
[2022-12-15 20:51:25] <+TheCulchie101> Agreed@NC
[2022-12-15 20:51:30] <%+mikeybish2020> every good pack is untradable - every SBC is now pretty much untradeable...not what is needed.
[2022-12-15 20:51:31] <darral94> Thats why everything is cheap, cos theres no coins
[2022-12-15 20:51:48] <simpeleziel1981> don't forget the preview LUL
[2022-12-15 20:51:56] <%Bradc118> Facts
[2022-12-15 20:51:59] <raffyrooo> spitting facts
[2022-12-15 20:52:19] <+giuseppe_esq> I am lucky to be able to play for 2 hours per day during the week.  I’m self employed, so my job is my priority
[2022-12-15 20:52:28] <drs32> In fifa 21, we could get good coins and cards from just grinding lib sbc
[2022-12-15 20:52:31] <finjcollins> I really like the gameplay this year and I hate the menus!
[2022-12-15 20:52:47] <yungmaseyy> It’s the top end of traders who hoard coins that manipulate the market
[2022-12-15 20:53:05] <+diioxal> Yea but they were for FREE. Ea is beyond that now
[2022-12-15 20:53:07] <lucas_h2001> they also give value to some non rare cards that are useless in the game now
[2022-12-15 20:53:14] <+Pelycaan> but but but star player packs nep
[2022-12-15 20:53:18] <simpeleziel1981> it was all grinding now it's buying
[2022-12-15 20:53:18] <%$blublud84> and they are the 3 things EA don't want us to have
[2022-12-15 20:53:27] <+giuseppe_esq> I really like the laggy, unresponsive gameplay StinkyGlitch
[2022-12-15 20:53:40] <+pringle94> I don't even log on at 6pm any more. I watch you or Nick checking out the content and then decide if I want to jump on or not
[2022-12-15 20:53:46] <+diioxal> every match completed should be a pack, every win a pack, every 10 wins another pack etc etc etc
[2022-12-15 20:53:59] <%$lfcplz> I got so so lucky last year, packed Headliners Mbappe in one of the small tradable mixed packs from league sbcs, few weeks later I packed Mbappe TOTY untradeable and suddenly had 4 million coins as well as an Mbappe. Thats the only way ill have coins again this year, is to get crazy lucky
[2022-12-15 20:54:02] <+Mr_Dylan413> @pringle94 Which nick?
[2022-12-15 20:54:04] <umarwise1> Why do you think they have not dropped league SBC’S?
[2022-12-15 20:54:24] <+pringle94> @mr_dylan413 Nick-28t
[2022-12-15 20:54:26] <MakaChaka> Is fifa on sale?
[2022-12-15 20:54:29] <baskbwiz> imo the game without the sbc grind to pack high rated fodder to do player sbcs has made it a game of make coins and buy the best players possible for your squad
[2022-12-15 20:54:35] <+Mr_Dylan413> @lfcplz You could trade. That's what I do and I have 4.4 million
[2022-12-15 20:54:36] <yungmaseyy> The lack of coins is also due to promo packs being released constantly so the fodder market decreases because there’s an abundances of players on the market until EA release an Icon or hero pack which makes them rise
[2022-12-15 20:54:41] <Cawley___> stopped playing fifa 4 years ago and the community is still being fucked over like this
