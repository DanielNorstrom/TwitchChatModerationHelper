[2022-12-21 22:29:02] <%Taylor131313> chat, do you think a healer could do 78k dps for 25 seconds? xdd
[2022-12-21 22:29:57] <%Grinikth> ofc
[2022-12-21 22:30:09] <%Grinikth> 78k is pretty low atm no?
[2022-12-21 22:30:19] <%Taylor131313> I said healer
[2022-12-21 22:30:22] <%Taylor131313> xdd
[2022-12-21 22:30:23] <%Grinikth> yeah
[2022-12-21 22:30:27] <%Grinikth> oh 78k dps
[2022-12-21 22:30:33] <%Grinikth> nvm LULW

[2022-12-21 22:30:37] <%Grinikth> i thought 78k hps
[2022-12-21 22:30:51] <%Taylor131313> because that's the requirement to break mythic rasz shield on mythic
[2022-12-21 22:31:00] <%Taylor131313> everyone including tanks and healers doing 78k dps for 25 secs xdd
[2022-12-21 22:31:06] <%Taylor131313> on average ofc

[2022-12-21 22:31:47] <%Taylor131313> yeah I think Liquid has also realised how wack is the tuning, they haven't pulled in half an hour
[2022-12-21 22:32:16] <%Taylor131313> they got rather clean to P2 then they faced the first megachonker of a shield xdd
