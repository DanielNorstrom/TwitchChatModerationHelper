[2022-12-08 15:03:45] <%ouranemily> Brotato was like the time I walked into the black tie ball and I was in jeans and I was like "I'm just gonna grab cake and go."
[2022-12-08 15:03:50] <%average_atlas> We still gotta get the date announcement for the 596 award show too, right?
[2022-12-08 15:03:56] <%Zeflyn> Is Sonic Frontiers worth getting? I heard it runs like a potato on switch
[2022-12-08 15:04:26] <%ouranemily> To me it ran fine on the Switch.
[2022-12-08 15:04:30] <%Zeflyn> which is sad because the entire game is about running
[2022-12-08 15:04:34] <%ouranemily> I enjoyed Sonic Frontiers, but I was gonna be biased anyway.
[2022-12-08 15:04:34] <%mudokonqueen> don't most things run like potatoes on switch, except isaac
[2022-12-08 15:04:46] <%Zeflyn> Hollow Knight runs buttery smooth
[2022-12-08 15:04:46] <%ouranemily> Mario games don't run like potatoes.

[2022-12-08 15:11:01] <%ouranemily> It's been a while since I did a good boxers run.
[2022-12-08 15:11:05] <%ouranemily> Stardew is a PC game.
[2022-12-08 15:11:15] <%average_atlas> It's also a Switch game
[2022-12-08 15:11:16] <%ouranemily> And I perfectioned it.  Not sure where to go.  I've reached bliss.
[2022-12-08 15:11:17] <@%Bretanadilewski> I think Stardew's on everything now
[2022-12-08 15:11:18] <!%benndayho> She likes all the Mario games, for her, but if I‚Äôm playing it‚Äôs snipper clips or 1-2 switch.
[2022-12-08 15:11:25] <%Zeflyn> Stardew actually runs nice on Switch, great couchtime game

[2022-12-08 15:12:00] <%ouranemily> I kill stuff in the mines, she teaches kids about reading, we go home, we talk, I sleep for two hours, I go to kill more stuff.  The life of a God.
[2022-12-08 15:13:27] <%ouranemily> Odyssey was fun.  Beat Bowser in my boxers in the game.

[2022-12-08 15:21:42] <%Zeflyn> the problem is that all the pinecones you find littering the ground have been relieved of their seeds by the local squirrels and chipmunks
[2022-12-08 15:21:47] <!%benndayho> I always toss the seeds and eat the shell.

[2022-12-08 16:15:46] <TheOrangeBread> it can be dangerous to drink a lot of water if you have not had any for a while

[2022-12-08 16:28:58] <VoidVigilante> all the curve does is help viewing angles on ultrawide monitors so you don't need to actually move your eyes/head as much to see end to end and provides a SLIGHT depth of field effect (very slight), it makes the picture more akin to your natural peripheral view

[2022-12-08 16:46:24] <%ouranemily> Vanilla is underrated, particularly soft serve.
[2022-12-08 16:46:24] <Fallout2x> vanilla comes from a bean so its just a flavor not a sweet flavor?

[2022-12-08 20:22:32] <%beardedjoe> cross is great
[2022-12-08 20:22:48] <!MFPuma> penta isn't that good early game, maybe mid/late when you have enough power ups purchased
[2022-12-08 20:22:48] <%RICKENJACK> Penta is best when you've maxed out 5 weapons already
