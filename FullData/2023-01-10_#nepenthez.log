[2023-01-10 19:24:03] <+GansoGo> champions league
[2023-01-10 19:24:03] <%+chriscfcwooooo> courtois absolutely nailed on in my opinion
[2023-01-10 19:24:05] <povilasjanulionis12345> Courtois won Cl final for Madrid

[2023-01-10 19:24:10] <%suraj672004> why is aspas there lol
[2023-01-10 19:24:13] <kmrchicken> I’m a Liverpool fan and Martinez deserves it over courtois
[2023-01-10 19:24:14] <brandtastico> Why no Kepa? :(
[2023-01-10 19:24:21] <marketmaestro> has to be courtois
[2023-01-10 19:24:29] <%+Metcalfe11> i feel like people miss interprt TOTY for best players... Martinez is in no way the best keeper but for me 100% was Keeper of the year
[2023-01-10 19:24:30] <b3a4e> @kmrchicken what is being a liverpool fan got to do with it lol
[2023-01-10 19:24:30] <+FifaEmiii> Courtois won ucl la liga cup and Emi played with a mid team ik he won the World Cup but courtois imo did better
[2023-01-10 19:24:33] <+GansoGo> 1 month over a season tho
[2023-01-10 19:24:42] <+lllllghostlllll> if James wasn't injured he would of been a great pick for toty
[2023-01-10 19:24:48] <%+matt_mcg_27> Don't know if there are any polish people in here but how much truth is there behind the gerrard to poland national team?
[2023-01-10 19:24:48] <jimjones9> id lean towards courtois more after his cl game against liverpool
[2023-01-10 19:24:49] <%+ultralizardx> As a wolves fan would like us to jus win a game
[2023-01-10 19:24:51] <yolokappaswag> martinez wasnt even good during the game, only in shootout!
[2023-01-10 19:24:54] <scottyboy_1872> viaplay cup > UCL and WC
[2023-01-10 19:25:02] <kmrchicken> @b3a4e Don’t get annoyed over a comment sensitive much 😂💀
[2023-01-10 19:25:07] <%+Metcalfe11> i was watching Nicks opinion and i had to turn it off lol
[2023-01-10 19:25:07] <paulro19> he wasn’t even a top 3 goalie in the tournament. just big time saves
[2023-01-10 19:25:07] <%memzy7> Hello nep how is the day going

[2023-01-10 19:25:13] <marvelsFUT> martinez wasnt good with villa this year though
[2023-01-10 19:25:14] <jazckychan> Not better than courtois all year tho
[2023-01-10 19:25:16] <+reecebudworth> Emi has not been insane all season
[2023-01-10 19:25:19] <leckmau5> Surely it’s not just one month? What about the qualifiers for WC and the whole lead up
[2023-01-10 19:25:20] <+reecebudworth> Obviously don’t watch villa
[2023-01-10 19:25:24] <b3a4e> @kmrchicken how am i getting annoyed lmao i just asked how is it linked. Doesnt make sense
[2023-01-10 19:25:25] <jawesomes93> Where's Pickford?
[2023-01-10 19:25:28] <marketmaestro> no matter what ea will pick courtoiz
[2023-01-10 19:25:34] <shaggybv88> hei Nep, how's it going?
[2023-01-10 19:25:35] <hoxium> Courtois saved some insane balls in UCL
[2023-01-10 19:25:39] <tescosleo> emi has been poor
[2023-01-10 19:25:42] <ariful2000> Messi did nothing last season
[2023-01-10 19:25:45] <+FifaEmiii> @hoxium that’s what I’m saying
[2023-01-10 19:25:51] <LucianoWasTaken_> Can’t believe ppl are actually saying Martinez over 1 or 2 saves vs Australia and France, he was so bad the rest of the WC while Courtois had an amazing year including the best individual performance in a UCL final in history
[2023-01-10 19:25:54] <BBCmexter> I like Leao for toty
[2023-01-10 19:25:55] <%+chriscfcwooooo> Emi is definitely not toty for me, he had a incredible world cup but courtois had a equal champions league campaign, I'd say they have had a pretty much equal league campaign aswell so it ends up going with who won more and that's courtois.
[2023-01-10 19:25:56] <+cummins1985> What is wrong with this game I find it now when I’m through on goal one on one with the keeper go to shoot and my player misss kicks and and go out of play it’s a joke are ea trying to ruin this game o for got they have already
[2023-01-10 19:25:56] <%suraj672004> emi has not been good at villa tbf. i woeka
[2023-01-10 19:25:57] <robertsavfc1122> From a villa fan, emi is crazy. From where he came from.. keeps villa in many many games
[2023-01-10 19:25:59] <kmrchicken> @b3a4e Why are you so bothered about it pal
[2023-01-10 19:26:01] <+inabitkid> emi deserves it but his antics after is where he went wrong
[2023-01-10 19:26:02] <+riftz2323> courtouis won ucl and laliga while benze carri
[2023-01-10 19:26:04] <coreystarnes91> Depends what you think is more important
[2023-01-10 19:26:04] <RandieFromEstonia> 16 games in prem 3 cs
[2023-01-10 19:26:04] <%+liquerbumhol> no Harry mcquire it's an insult to football Kappa
[2023-01-10 19:26:06] <%+kingnovakin> Emi has a shout but if we are talking the overall year, Courtois imo, he was immense in ucl
[2023-01-10 19:26:09] <coreystarnes91> World Cup or a domestic double
[2023-01-10 19:26:13] <marvelsFUT> emi was pretty good with villa on 2021 but not for 2022 for sure
[2023-01-10 19:26:13] <jednotska> Alisson
[2023-01-10 19:26:18] <+FifaEmiii> @riftz2323 courtois made amazing saves
[2023-01-10 19:26:20] <%+ultralizardx> He was playing to get gerrard sacked v Chelsea
[2023-01-10 19:26:20] <b3a4e> @kmrchicken keep saying im getting annoyed wont annoy me xD, i aint twelve
[2023-01-10 19:26:23] <%memzy7> I agree nep atm we can say martinez is doing a better job then all the others gk
[2023-01-10 19:26:24] <kirksnake25> both gks have a shout for it. why can't it just be a close call. I'd not think either was robbed
[2023-01-10 19:26:25] <marketmaestro> i like courtois emi is a nob
[2023-01-10 19:26:26] <robertsavfc1122> That save in the World Cup pretty much won it for them
[2023-01-10 19:26:27] <ariful2000> People thinking toty is based on this year
[2023-01-10 19:26:29] <+iceey_ice> He probably saved Messi career with that last min save
[2023-01-10 19:26:30] <%+Metcalfe11> Martinez basically made the greatest and most important save of all time in the last minute of the world cup final. that alone puts him in there for me
[2023-01-10 19:26:30] <%chrisdepot> We have to talk about how Martinez went from a goalkeeper going out on loan every year to help arsenal win an fa cup to becoming the starter for Argentina and villa and then going on to win a copa America and a WC easy keeper of the year
[2023-01-10 19:26:31] <+ericsoares23> alisson? he's been the best for me
[2023-01-10 19:26:31] <%+matt_mcg_27> I do feel like that toty is basically based on opinion, like I don't think anyone would be upset if Emi, Courtois or Ederson got in toty
[2023-01-10 19:26:32] <+AnthonyJ1988> Based on that theory though …. Does otamendi deserve to be there? No world cup win and he wouldn’t be there?
[2023-01-10 19:26:32] <Agoffi> did martinez play well for argentina when the won the WC? tbf didn't watch every game, in the final he seems like pickford just yells alot and people think hes good because of it
[2023-01-10 19:26:34] <%+bazzay10> I voted for martinez, winning the world cup as well as being the best keeper of the tournament pretty much makes you have an insane season
[2023-01-10 19:26:34] <%+FUTAccountants> its neps opinion tbh i agree
[2023-01-10 19:26:38] <Dodgeyroger48> HeyGuys
[2023-01-10 19:26:38] <+inabitkid> imo i would honestly go for a cheeky little kaylor navas
[2023-01-10 19:26:39] <+lllllghostlllll> Spitting Facts
[2023-01-10 19:26:40] <AbdulTarar> Thibaut was consistent over the entire year, Emi was consistent for  less time imo
[2023-01-10 19:26:43] <leckmau5> I’m voting Ederson just cause I can’t decide between Emi and Thibaut. Agree with both points.
[2023-01-10 19:26:48] <%$Adzzzzz16> No one in here has watched every Madrid game. They just go with the flow
[2023-01-10 19:26:48] <%+kingnovakin> @ariful2000 what is it based on?
[2023-01-10 19:26:50] <%+chriscfcwooooo> Emi is definitely not toty for me, he had a incredible world cup but courtois had a equal champions league campaign, I'd say they have had a pretty much equal league campaign aswell so it ends up going with who won more and that's courtois.
[2023-01-10 19:26:51] <yolokappaswag> @nepenthez martinez wasnt really that good during the actual wc games he mainly was decisive as penaltykiller
[2023-01-10 19:26:54] <+ericsoares23> i voted for alisson
[2023-01-10 19:26:54] <+cummins1985> What is wrong with this game I find it now when I’m through on goal one on one with the keeper go to shoot and my player misss kicks and and go out of play it’s a joke are ea trying to ruin this game o for got they have already
[2023-01-10 19:27:00] <AbdulTarar> Livakovic was better than Martinez at the world cup
[2023-01-10 19:27:00] <kmrchicken> @b3a4e Why question it then? No one else is making a fuss
[2023-01-10 19:27:00] <paulro19> Courtois was great in the WC besides last game. only reason they beat Canada
[2023-01-10 19:27:06] <jazckychan> That’s not an insane season tho, that’s an insane month.
[2023-01-10 19:27:07] <+FifaEmiii> I mean everybody got their opinions and we gotta respect
[2023-01-10 19:27:09] <%$darwinswift> Emi Martinez rise is crazy he was on loan at us (Reading seasons ago ) an was amazing

[2023-01-10 19:27:24] <hoxium> I voted for Courtois, he was so insane in UCL
[2023-01-10 19:27:24] <ben032005> Is 1 month > WHOLE YEAR. People are crazy
[2023-01-10 19:27:25] <%+Metcalfe11> Haaland has to be in the team but so many choose not too
[2023-01-10 19:27:25] <+FifaEmiii> Joe hart better
[2023-01-10 19:27:27] <+AnthonyJ1988> So Nep does otamendi deserve to make it if Martinez has?
[2023-01-10 19:27:27] <%therealdraigo> Yooo
[2023-01-10 19:27:29] <Agoffi> like if you say that about martinez though then you have to say that about every argentina player
[2023-01-10 19:27:29] <kmrchicken> Nunez for TOTY
[2023-01-10 19:27:31] <$Cheetoo13> yo neppo
[2023-01-10 19:27:31] <69tw> should be a missing one LUL
[2023-01-10 19:27:32] <vitesse123_026> Are you gonna upload this as a video on youtube??
[2023-01-10 19:27:35] <b3a4e> its TOTY not TOTT lol
[2023-01-10 19:27:35] <%coops1871> Courtois for me
[2023-01-10 19:27:39] <mrsuch1t123> EVERYONE VOTE NUNEZ
[2023-01-10 19:27:40] <LucianoWasTaken_> Can’t believe ppl are actually saying Martinez over his season at Villa and a couple saves vs Australia and France, he was so bad the rest of the WC while Courtois had an amazing year including the best individual performance in a UCL final in history
[2023-01-10 19:27:41] <theonlyinstrumental> why are you there????
[2023-01-10 19:27:42] <+FifaEmiii> Joe hart is the goat goalkeeper
[2023-01-10 19:27:44] <%suraj672004> @hoxium literally game changer in final
[2023-01-10 19:27:45] <$Cheetoo13> did you see the new tranfers for benfica?
[2023-01-10 19:27:47] <KongKunsti> As a Villa fan I totally agree that Emi is our best player. But nah i dont think he is the best anyway, top-5 yea, and thats huge for Villa
[2023-01-10 19:27:48] <+inabitkid> lmfao
[2023-01-10 19:27:50] <jawesomes93> Fiorentina GOAT
[2023-01-10 19:27:51] <mrsuch1t123> Darwizzy
[2023-01-10 19:27:51] <ariful2000> @ariful2000 Based on last year....... messi did nothing in his first year
[2023-01-10 19:27:57] <%+iamterry1997> My Toty vote was emi, theo Hernandez, Ruben dias, otamendi, cancelo, kdb, Bellingham, modric, mbappe, haaland & messi
[2023-01-10 19:28:11] <%+ultralizardx> U don’t know … he made 79 tackles in 4 games
[2023-01-10 19:28:13] <mrsuch1t123> Half of this list is discard fodder
[2023-01-10 19:28:17] <69tw> hes got EA nudes LUL
[2023-01-10 19:28:18] <%+theoldmanrtg7619> Afternoon nep I fear that toty voting is just going to be a majority of Madrid messi and kdb in the voting
[2023-01-10 19:28:20] <jednotska> Biraghi there but no Trent
[2023-01-10 19:28:24] <+FifaEmiii> @iamterry1997 benzema???
[2023-01-10 19:28:24] <mrsuch1t123> Bro sucked eq
[2023-01-10 19:28:25] <scottyboy_1872> thoughts on Cantwell to rangers?
[2023-01-10 19:28:26] <hoxium> I feel like club performance is overshadowed by WC for this TOTY
[2023-01-10 19:28:26] <theonlyinstrumental> i think the three guaranteed players are messi mbappe and modric
[2023-01-10 19:28:28] <@%CaniSports> Whatsup buddyyy
[2023-01-10 19:28:34] <Kuhrim> id be okay if someone like kim min jae made it but biraghi is a weird one
[2023-01-10 19:28:35] <shantoudiin> hey nep
[2023-01-10 19:28:37] <%+fistyanan> @jednotska trent lol
[2023-01-10 19:28:37] <%SimpleSimi> trent doesnt deserve it tho
[2023-01-10 19:28:37] <+FifaEmiii> Joe hart deserves toty
[2023-01-10 19:28:38] <%+Metcalfe11> Trent deserves nothing lol
[2023-01-10 19:28:46] <%+iamterry1997> @fifaemiii Nah no Benz
[2023-01-10 19:28:48] <hoxium> Mbappe will probably get a TOTY, but he didn't play that well
[2023-01-10 19:28:50] <KongKunsti> I even think Milenkovic from Fiorentina is better the other CB
[2023-01-10 19:28:53] <$Cheetoo13> did you see the new transfer for benfica? you think casper is going to go up on sorare?
[2023-01-10 19:28:53] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> Neville said he had Robertson and Alaba in there. And was shocked he wasnt allowed
[2023-01-10 19:28:55] <%therealdraigo> Packed duplicate jairzinho yesterday. Was upset so went to my 2nd account played drafts and packed a Neymar  cent from a 81x11
[2023-01-10 19:29:01] <hoxium> Vinicius deserves a TOTY way more than Mbappe
[2023-01-10 19:29:02] <69tw> theres no Rudiguer or Alaba nominated LUL
[2023-01-10 19:29:02] <stinglucas> hope grifo is in
[2023-01-10 19:29:05] <%+matt_mcg_27> ngl i forgot Madrid even won the CL

[2023-01-10 19:29:20] <%SimpleSimi> no alaba is crazy

[2023-01-10 19:29:43] <The2bills> no Alaba is surprising
[2023-01-10 19:29:47] <+grahambertram> Nunez top tier tbh
[2023-01-10 19:29:51] <heavymachinegun1> I see a lot of frauds voting Casemiro
[2023-01-10 19:29:52] <+R3yn0ld5> Casemiro over kimmich surely
[2023-01-10 19:29:54] <+GeorgeCuz> Imo TOTY should be madrid, city and liverpool players with mbappe + messi
[2023-01-10 19:29:56] <%+fistyanan> first ban of the day GG lmao trolls around already
[2023-01-10 19:30:00] <%+gpnick7> newcastle are 4th in a jan to jan lg table so for me trippier has to be there

[2023-01-10 19:30:10] <Dash_counter7> hello nep
[2023-01-10 19:30:11] <AbdulTarar> Valverde isn't even a top 3 midfielder on his own team so idk how he's getting toty shouts

[2023-01-10 19:30:29] <%+beardedlegend83ttv> i just voted for players i want to have fun with
[2023-01-10 19:30:37] <@%Witchwalker70> Yes just for the video ones were so obvious
[2023-01-10 19:30:38] <xRumpelstilskinz> Nep why do you evem pay attention to negative stuff
[2023-01-10 19:30:41] <%carlitothemexicanwrestler> came for fifa content, stayed for nep telling people to eff off
[2023-01-10 19:30:45] <LucianoWasTaken_> TOTY imo Courtois, Theo, Alaba, Rudiger, Cancelo, KDB, Modric, Bellingham, Mbappe, Messi & Benzema 12th Haaland
[2023-01-10 19:30:47] <%+Joe1998_> I got blocked on twitter years ago for asking why is your DP you in a Christmas hat in July one year. Makes no sense
[2023-01-10 19:30:56] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> The idea that Casemiro has no back up for being in peoples TOTY is hilarious to me. Anti United bias running wild
[2023-01-10 19:30:56] <misschmassh21> I voted for every ac milan player 🤝
[2023-01-10 19:30:59] <mrsuch1t123> Rudiger not in noninee mate
[2023-01-10 19:31:00] <%+MlKE_2023> Wout Weghorst toty for me
[2023-01-10 19:31:03] <marvelsFUT> saw quite a few people votimg for odegaard what's your opinion as an ars fan?
[2023-01-10 19:31:04] <+Kieran96cfc> LucianoWasTaken_ rudiger and alaba arent even in the voting
[2023-01-10 19:31:04] <johnterryspants> Koulibaly in there but no Rudiger is an arrestable offence for terrorism from EA
[2023-01-10 19:31:07] <%+gunnerfc2022> this looks very interesting nep 😀👏
[2023-01-10 19:31:13] <%+bneto10> Hey Nep, what are some of your favotire Sorare content creators?

[2023-01-10 19:31:18] <vitesse123_026> Are you gonna upload this as a video on yt nep?
[2023-01-10 19:31:21] <LucianoWasTaken_> @kieran96cfc thats why i said imo ea trolling tbh
[2023-01-10 19:31:24] <hoxium> It's Casemiro or Valverde to be honest
[2023-01-10 19:31:26] <%danthewolvesfan> you said in your video about the toty voting, you picked benzema over haaland because haaland didn't play in the world cup  but nor did benzema? or did I misunderstood your reasoning?
[2023-01-10 19:31:29] <$Cheetoo13> casper to benfica is a massive dub for Sorare
[2023-01-10 19:31:31] <hoxium> And both were decent
[2023-01-10 19:31:31] <kmrchicken> I think Trent should have been in there tbf
[2023-01-10 19:31:32] <$DannyDVG9> pepsi cherry?
[2023-01-10 19:31:43] <CurtisGiles> well he has got backup hence why his in the voting for toty
[2023-01-10 19:31:46] <%+theoldmanrtg7619> Rudiger for what ???
[2023-01-10 19:31:48] <mrsuch1t123> Even Rodrygo
[2023-01-10 19:31:49] <AbdulTarar> Modric, Kroos, Casemiro are all better than Valverde
[2023-01-10 19:31:54] <jazckychan> @kmrchicken No chance
[2023-01-10 19:31:54] <coutinho_99> facts
[2023-01-10 19:31:56] <xRumpelstilskinz> wait isnt rudiger nominated
[2023-01-10 19:31:56] <%+matt_mcg_27> @SpreadsheetFifa I think it is less anti-united but more people think there are better players also DMs get less praise look at casemiro, partey and rodri for example
[2023-01-10 19:31:59] <marketmaestro> fact
[2023-01-10 19:32:02] <%+Metcalfe11> i think midfield its hard too look past de bruyne modric then its one of a few who have done really well
[2023-01-10 19:32:02] <kirksnake25> for me I'd like to see gvardiol get in. he's been insanely good this year
[2023-01-10 19:32:02] <+Natty1904> rudiger did not win league
[2023-01-10 19:32:04] <MickeysIce> No Rudiger is crazy
[2023-01-10 19:32:06] <%SimpleSimi> crazy
[2023-01-10 19:32:07] <mrsuch1t123> Valverde is top 5 midfielders itw
[2023-01-10 19:32:10] <@%Viperlization> hey pal
[2023-01-10 19:32:16] <+Kieran96cfc> yeah its crazy alaba and rudiger not even in it, I know rudiger wasnt in the champions league winning squad but he was great at chelsea before that still
[2023-01-10 19:32:16] <xRumpelstilskinz> Bruuuuhhhhhh howww
[2023-01-10 19:32:16] <hoxium> Rodrygo saved Real last season in 2 games, he deserved a nominee over a lot of players
[2023-01-10 19:32:16] <@%Viperlization> is the tier list for me to edit?
[2023-01-10 19:32:19] <here4rewards_> there should be a TOTY Manger that gives everyone 1 chem point
[2023-01-10 19:32:21] <marvelsFUT> maybe ea will do something with the cards not nominated?
[2023-01-10 19:32:21] <MickeysIce> Rudiger was a stud at WC
[2023-01-10 19:32:22] <+tomtaz10> Alaba is nuts!
[2023-01-10 19:32:24] <+FifaEmiii> Rudiger should’ve been toty
[2023-01-10 19:32:26] <%+theoldmanrtg7619> Alana not in is crazy
[2023-01-10 19:32:29] <AbdulTarar> @mrsuch1t123 Valverde dropped a huge stinker at the world cup without kroos and modric carrying him
[2023-01-10 19:32:32] <%Sbradley08> Imagine if Ea did a TOTY team 1 and team 2...
[2023-01-10 19:32:33] <marvelsFUT> like alaba
[2023-01-10 19:32:34] <johnterryspants> Not true, that would’ve meant Salomon Kalou would’ve been a TOTY in 2012 and he was the worst thing I’ve seen at the bridge in a long time
[2023-01-10 19:32:34] <@%Viperlization> alright
[2023-01-10 19:32:36] <LucianoWasTaken_> Rudiger was amazing
[2023-01-10 19:32:38] <%therealdraigo> Imagine benzema who won the balon d oro doesn’t get a toty this year
[2023-01-10 19:32:39] <kmrchicken> @jazckychan Why? because you support united? Stop the Liverpool agenda
[2023-01-10 19:32:40] <%+paulmc93> Evening Neppo
[2023-01-10 19:32:40] <Dogancanaksu10> Rudiger's season made him go to Madrid
[2023-01-10 19:32:40] <RandieFromEstonia> @MickeysIce right is that why they got knocked out early
[2023-01-10 19:32:43] <%+theoldmanrtg7619> Alaba sorry
[2023-01-10 19:32:44] <%therealdraigo> He should automatically get ine
[2023-01-10 19:32:44] <Robertogames64> messi mbappe benz are definitely gonna get the toty but i honestly reckon leao/vini/ deserve a shout
[2023-01-10 19:32:45] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> @SpreadsheetFifa I would argue there hasnt been a better DM this year. Won everything he could apart from WC in which he was on the fringes of most TOTT's
[2023-01-10 19:32:46] <%$knosher1> is vini jr nominated
[2023-01-10 19:32:49] <+AnthonyJ1988> Otamendi being in that list is a joke
[2023-01-10 19:32:50] <doodsm> Vote thiago Silva
[2023-01-10 19:32:53] <%+mehweather11> he kept us in tact w thiago silva
[2023-01-10 19:32:53] <mrsuch1t123> For the midfield are we saying Kdb modric Casemiro. Kdb Modric Valverde. Or kdb Modric Bellingham
[2023-01-10 19:32:56] <yungmaseyy> James over Robertson/TAA is just mad, I understand Trent but Robertson has been solid
[2023-01-10 19:32:56] <+sealdawg> Is it becoming more of picking players that play well in video game, as apprised to real life footy merit?
[2023-01-10 19:32:59] <+Brad1210> KDB should not get a toty
[2023-01-10 19:33:02] <%+michaelomari> rudiger was one of the best defenders in the world last season imo. crazy exclusion
[2023-01-10 19:33:03] <%EitchBee> Reece is good but hasn't he been injured for most of the year?
[2023-01-10 19:33:04] <johnterryspants> No

[2023-01-10 19:33:41] <hoxium> It's Casemiro or Valverde tho
[2023-01-10 19:33:43] <+Kieran96cfc> has to be casemiro kdb and modric imo
[2023-01-10 19:33:44] <%+MonstaReqs> kdb should be in toty
[2023-01-10 19:33:45] <vitesse123_026> What is otamendi doing here😹
[2023-01-10 19:33:45] <MrPancake91> Hows Mitrovic not at least a nominee for 43 goals last year in the Championship and 11 so far this year
[2023-01-10 19:33:46] <%+cantstopkid> KDB is the best midfielder in the world...
[2023-01-10 19:33:48] <+Jackmoore__10> Kdb has been world class for city in every game
[2023-01-10 19:33:57] <LucianoWasTaken_> Casemiro was the best field player in the UCL final imo
[2023-01-10 19:33:57] <%+MlKE_2023> Casemiro , KDB and Modric is  my midfield
[2023-01-10 19:34:00] <jawesomes93> I'd say Casemiro but I don't watch La Liga
[2023-01-10 19:34:00] <hoxium> @mrsuch1t123 Casemiro is very good for United

[2023-01-10 19:34:18] <+giuseppe_esq> @mehweather11 Really? I thought Spurs have been poor for years.  Sorry, my bad
[2023-01-10 19:34:21] <vitesse123_026> KDB- modric- valverde
[2023-01-10 19:34:21] <+Tauqir95> Thoughts on Felix to Chelsea?
[2023-01-10 19:34:22] <here4rewards_> My sorare brain is calling for Otamendi to be included.
[2023-01-10 19:34:23] <+Getmore79> Nep may Jesus bless and keep you and your family my brother 🙏🏼
[2023-01-10 19:34:23] <%+mehweather11> imagine lukaku was there 😂
[2023-01-10 19:34:24] <+AnthonyJ1988> So if people think Martinez should be in it then otamendi gets in too?

[2023-01-10 19:34:29] <brandtastico> Rudiger > Koulibaly

[2023-01-10 19:34:40] <marvelsFUT> kdb-casemiro-modric would probably be the most fair toty based on the season they had
[2023-01-10 19:34:40] <mrsuch1t123> I think Kdb Modric Casemiro

[2023-01-10 19:44:41] <+BYCakes> team of the year though not team of the 22/23 season he barely played last season
[2023-01-10 19:44:42] <boki1979> Trippier hell no
[2023-01-10 19:44:42] <+Kieran96cfc> Theres probably gonna be like 20+ perople in toty tier
[2023-01-10 19:44:42] <+simriclap86> he's the top defender on the sky ff
[2023-01-10 19:44:42] <+juicemongrel> but only 11 deserve it then no?
[2023-01-10 19:44:43] <+sealdawg> Liverpool went through bad period of buying players from stats. Not a great method
[2023-01-10 19:44:43] <boki1979> :D
[2023-01-10 19:44:44] <kmrchicken> Trent should be there

[2023-01-10 19:44:51] <Dogancanaksu10> I %100 agree with Trippier decision
[2023-01-10 19:44:53] <%divkush> ok fair
[2023-01-10 19:44:55] <%clarky45> This is the calendar year though, not for the start of the season, Trippier has been brilliant this season but nothing special last season
[2023-01-10 19:44:56] <kirksnake25> trips and Bruno G both deserve for how they've elevated newcastle
[2023-01-10 19:44:59] <+maxevans1234> look at newcastle this year from january.... they have been insane
[2023-01-10 19:45:00] <%SimpleSimi> people are so slow hahah

[2023-01-10 19:45:04] <%+Rhysmead1> Honourable mention at best for me, injured for 2 months at the beginning and average at World Cup, great in the league after injury
[2023-01-10 19:45:09] <kmrchicken> @sealdawg Rent free, what’s your point?

[2023-01-10 19:45:28] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> Nep is doing a tier list. He does not have to choose 11 players in TOTY category. If you want his TOTY vote, check out the video on the main channel.
[2023-01-10 19:45:29] <salah446333> he's decent

[2023-01-10 19:45:44] <%+anthonyy_25> Agree with all your points other than Trippier being good for england. Was atrocious in the game he started, albeit that being a small sample.
[2023-01-10 19:45:46] <+jamesfranklin12_> As a gooner he pocketed martinelli… not pant people can
[2023-01-10 19:45:49] <%fifa_mikek> hes not on the level of walker, cancelo, theo h, hakimi
[2023-01-10 19:45:49] <denco5> if you are ranking real madrid beacuse of what they have won, why trippier then?
[2023-01-10 19:45:55] <mrsuch1t123> Bro is serious💀

[2023-01-10 19:46:24] <cacheton15> Very underwhelming in the World Cup
[2023-01-10 19:46:25] <@%CaniSports> Trapp was UNREAL for Eintracht to win Euro League
[2023-01-10 19:46:28] <+Wessoni> He is better than szcnncnncney

[2023-01-10 19:46:33] <%+mehweather11> he was key in their europa league run
[2023-01-10 19:46:37] <+PaulRight> Reece James has better stats than trippier
[2023-01-10 19:46:46] <salah446333> because he's not good

[2023-01-10 19:46:59] <jezfi> Villareal got UCL semis tbf

[2023-01-10 19:48:11] <boris37> martinez had a save % less than 40, shit keeper who can stop penaltys

[2023-01-10 19:48:33] <+memphisdepie88> toty tho. not team of the last 2 months for me

[2023-01-10 19:48:37] <+juicemongrel> hes been bang average in everything else
[2023-01-10 19:48:38] <+the_pojk> would argue courtois way to cl title was a lot harder than martinez wc
[2023-01-10 19:48:39] <brivett05> trippier doesn't deserve it imo

[2023-01-10 19:48:40] <gvm797> most decisive is arguable, Casillas' toe 2010
[2023-01-10 19:48:40] <paulro19> Another good goalie could have done what Martinez did in that position tho
[2023-01-10 19:48:49] <AHumanAlien> @ConnorBeey and? We're talking about 1 player not the Villa squad?

[2023-01-10 19:49:06] <salah446333> it is goalkeeper of the year not goalkeeper of the world cup

[2023-01-10 19:49:09] <jazckychan> Got the golden glove because they won it, if they lost it he would’nt of won the golden hand
[2023-01-10 19:49:10] <+juicemongrel> also was pretty mediocre in the final apart from the one save at the end

[2023-01-10 19:53:47] <salah446333> that's the same argument for greizman is for Martinez
[2023-01-10 19:53:50] <theonlyinstrumental> thats fair enough

[2023-01-10 19:57:44] <%$BobbyTambling> But by that logic Nep otsmendi should be in bottom tier

[2023-01-10 19:58:49] <+juicemongrel> hes been pretty shit for chelsea tho
[2023-01-10 19:58:49] <%+cocomonkye> he's been very average for chelseas

[2023-01-10 19:58:50] <AleksanderVK> He is shocking all year
[2023-01-10 19:58:52] <AbdulTarar> He wasnt playing for chelsea last year anyways

[2023-01-10 19:59:00] <%$kinglester2692> he was good at napoli too
[2023-01-10 19:59:01] <alexvz1008> Koulibaly has been one of the worst signings
[2023-01-10 19:59:01] <salah446333> no
[2023-01-10 19:59:01] <boris37> griezmann had a shit first half of the season, why is he a honourable Mention and son not?
[2023-01-10 19:59:04] <%Rickz1999> otamendi had a terrible last season with benfica, they finished 3rd with the biggest budget ever on liga portugal
[2023-01-10 19:59:14] <sh_aliin1> won afcon, but other than that he's been average at best, even backend of last season
[2023-01-10 19:59:14] <jeffbob213> whoo
[2023-01-10 19:59:14] <boris37> koulibaly was shit for chelsea

[2023-01-10 20:00:12] <sh_aliin1> @Rickz1999 i hear you but messi also carried a world cup
[2023-01-10 20:00:15] <rubz3n> sometimes just being NOMINATED is a prize for these kind of players so fair from EA
[2023-01-10 20:00:21] <%bazza3166> i honestly never heard of this guy
[2023-01-10 20:00:24] <%Rickz1999> @AbdulTarar thats right, so messi played a month out of 12 months and deserves? how about vini?
[2023-01-10 20:00:30] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> @maurits1019 Is that why Benzema is in TOTY?
[2023-01-10 20:00:33] <+giuseppe_esq> Italy will bounce back

[2023-01-10 20:00:36] <+zack2000> @rickz1999 itse based on year. not season. Messi has The most goal contributions in the world
[2023-01-10 20:00:38] <+nelsonxo_99> italy have plenty of CB's, also he has been one of their best players, doesn't deserve a TOTY tho, consistant good player for them tho
[2023-01-10 20:00:40] <maurits1019> Berghuis played very good for Ajax and in the Champions League Nep

[2023-01-10 20:06:22] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> Against Portuguese league sides though right?
[2023-01-10 20:06:22] <theonlyinstrumental> no way is grimaldo up there with koulibaly mane kane salah etc
[2023-01-10 20:06:23] <+nelsonxo_99> rabiot is why are you there
[2023-01-10 20:06:23] <jeffbob213> grimaldo is spanish cancelo
[2023-01-10 20:06:26] <salah446333> he's average
[2023-01-10 20:06:31] <%jbrownie22> Just add another tier
[2023-01-10 20:06:32] <%$BobbyTambling> but ur also comparing LIga NOS to an actual proper league
[2023-01-10 20:06:33] <%+DirtyDishFC> Benfica play 10 challenging games a year
[2023-01-10 20:06:37] <afonso7010> Taremi should be there Porto won everything
[2023-01-10 20:06:37] <+smokeymcpot_99> Do you think Grimaldo is better than Theo Hernandez?
[2023-01-10 20:06:39] <%Rickz1999> i see grimaldo play all year nep and hes very bad defending that why benfica struggled last season
[2023-01-10 20:06:43] <AHumanAlien> ha ha ha
[2023-01-10 20:06:46] <%jbrownie22> Above average (Good season)
[2023-01-10 20:06:46] <%+ddouglas14> LUL
[2023-01-10 20:06:46] <%$BobbyTambling> Messi won the WC though
[2023-01-10 20:06:47] <+leoxuakin> thats fair
[2023-01-10 20:06:48] <davidfoley1> I think it’s fair
[2023-01-10 20:06:48] <salah446333> don't use the word great
[2023-01-10 20:06:48] <S1m95on> Berghuis up then if Grimaldo is up
[2023-01-10 20:06:48] <+smokeymcpot_99> You should do that though
[2023-01-10 20:06:49] <%+kamsb24> What
[2023-01-10 20:06:50] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> No
[2023-01-10 20:06:50] <+Kieran96cfc> True LUL
[2023-01-10 20:06:51] <+ruaraidhmair> he should be between average and HM
[2023-01-10 20:06:52] <+leoxuakin> yes
[2023-01-10 20:06:53] <Andrelemos6> @rickz1999 he is the best Lb in Portuguese League
[2023-01-10 20:06:53] <fxJulian> LuL
[2023-01-10 20:06:55] <%+kamsb24> Nah man
[2023-01-10 20:06:58] <kirksnake25> if we did that we'd only have prem at the top
[2023-01-10 20:06:59] <+smokeymcpot_99> Could have Sunday league players in toty cos they scored 50 a season
[2023-01-10 20:06:59] <jeffbob213> grimaldo is spanish cancelo
[2023-01-10 20:07:00] <afonso7010> how there’s 3 Benfica players and no one from Porto
[2023-01-10 20:07:00] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> Yeah
[2023-01-10 20:07:00] <S1m95on> what about Berghuis
[2023-01-10 20:07:02] <+fordykyle1> yes
[2023-01-10 20:07:05] <lfcbobby01> Messi and Neymar done well in WC and Champions league, grimaldo not done well in champions league
[2023-01-10 20:07:06] <AbdulTarar> you said biraghi didn't even get called up to italy but don't mention it for grimaldi? just want you to be consistent
[2023-01-10 20:07:07] <%$BobbyTambling> you are going from one extreme to the other Nep, i get your point but what you're doing is unecessary
[2023-01-10 20:07:08] <maurits1019> NEP YOUR TOXIC AGAIN
[2023-01-10 20:07:08] <%+DirtyDishFC> La Liga  mid table is WAY BETTER
[2023-01-10 20:07:09] <AHumanAlien> Portugal league is ranked higher correct
[2023-01-10 20:07:11] <@%+DavidMNobrega> It was for about a week tbf
[2023-01-10 20:07:11] <%+athletico_pathetico> no
[2023-01-10 20:07:14] <%+kamsb24> idk
[2023-01-10 20:07:14] <%$petejb1990> But look at the company grimaldo has in that category. A lot of those other players are much better than grimaldo
[2023-01-10 20:07:14] <%$Rocky94RPC> Tbh yes they are
[2023-01-10 20:07:15] <%Rickz1999> @Andrelemos6 last year he was easly the 3rd best
[2023-01-10 20:07:15] <Kuhrim> nah that was only for like 1 month
[2023-01-10 20:07:15] <Ardi_01_> nah was only for a week
[2023-01-10 20:07:16] <+memphisdepie88> the golden shoe literally categorises leagues based on difficulty
[2023-01-10 20:07:16] <lfcbobby01> It’s not Ligue un is ranked higher
[2023-01-10 20:07:18] <+Kieran96cfc> Id say Portugese league is more competetive then the french lgiue
[2023-01-10 20:07:19] <+leoxuakin> no
[2023-01-10 20:07:21] <%+athletico_pathetico> it was only above for like a week
[2023-01-10 20:07:23] <AHumanAlien> It was above
[2023-01-10 20:07:25] <Robertogames64> No lmfao
[2023-01-10 20:07:25] <AbdulTarar> Grimaldo didn't even get a game at the world cup
[2023-01-10 20:07:25] <%$BobbyTambling> you are going from one extreme to the other Nep, i get your point but what you're doing is unnecessary
[2023-01-10 20:07:25] <@%+DavidMNobrega> But Portuguese football is underrated in general
[2023-01-10 20:07:26] <+DenizSeason> it was only for a week
[2023-01-10 20:07:27] <%jbrownie22> Definitely need another tier
[2023-01-10 20:07:27] <+smokeymcpot_99> Get me in toty I scored 47 goals for my Sunday team this year
[2023-01-10 20:07:28] <%+sknvbj> except ligue 1 is stilla top 5 league
[2023-01-10 20:07:29] <Robertogames64> That was years ago
[2023-01-10 20:07:31] <%robo_cfc> Grimaldo's been good in the ucl too tbf
[2023-01-10 20:07:32] <+T9J1D> didn't Benfica do bits against PSG in the UCL??

[2023-01-10 20:07:38] <+ericsoares23> you need another tier nep
[2023-01-10 20:07:40] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> French league fine. Lewa? Bundes and La Liga?
[2023-01-10 20:07:41] <+nelsonxo_99> what is the top 5 order actually
[2023-01-10 20:07:41] <lfcbobby01> They’re objectively not close
[2023-01-10 20:07:42] <gvm797> nah, the Netherlands almost overook both France and Portugal
[2023-01-10 20:07:44] <AHumanAlien> Look at all the players from that league doing well in other leagues
[2023-01-10 20:07:45] <+AidanFitz25> grimaldos good performances in the ucl only came against maccabi haifa no?
[2023-01-10 20:07:47] <MarioBr0ther> if Grimaldo got into nominations, then Taremi should definitely got in, have you seen him play?
[2023-01-10 20:07:47] <salah446333> no your wrong
[2023-01-10 20:07:48] <chev096> Eredivisie is up there too
[2023-01-10 20:07:49] <boris37> but then why berghuis so low? has been class for ajax, best player in the dutch league for months
[2023-01-10 20:07:50] <%+teasyy_tom> years ago LUL g1ngeLUL LUL g1ngeLUL
[2023-01-10 20:07:50] <jeffbob213> grimaldo is spanish cancelo
[2023-01-10 20:07:51] <%+kamsb24> Yup
[2023-01-10 20:07:51] <%$J1___> just cant see how grimaldo is in there with some of those players
[2023-01-10 20:07:51] <+MasNLFC> I expect a Nunez honorable mention then
[2023-01-10 20:07:53] <+smokeymcpot_99> Yeah in the group stage
[2023-01-10 20:07:54] <s4__mo> look at the players next to grimaldo !!!
[2023-01-10 20:07:54] <%+callumalc7> Biraghi has been good, I think why are you there is harsh
[2023-01-10 20:07:56] <%+m0ng00se44> France is absolute trash
[2023-01-10 20:07:57] <+smokeymcpot_99> They both qualified
[2023-01-10 20:07:58] <%Rickz1999> compare grimaldo with other lb from liga portugal
[2023-01-10 20:08:02] <+leoxuakin> he was dog shit
[2023-01-10 20:08:05] <lfcbobby01> 🤣🤣🤣🤣
[2023-01-10 20:08:11] <%+DirtyDishFC> Im fine with using Ligue 1 against PSG players. Messi is only in cause of World Cup. Thats my opinion anyways
[2023-01-10 20:08:11] <nero_182> @MasNLFC No way
[2023-01-10 20:08:11] <mrfasth22> everyone think prem is sooo much better than all other leagues smh
[2023-01-10 20:08:15] <AbdulTarar> thats not respectable, it's garbage
[2023-01-10 20:08:20] <%$J1___> the disrespect to the other in HM is mad
[2023-01-10 20:08:21] <lfcbobby01> He did awful let’s be honest
[2023-01-10 20:08:26] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> Check my Discord message btw
[2023-01-10 20:08:29] <%Rickz1999> he plays good against juve and psg and struggles against rio ave and vizela lmao
[2023-01-10 20:08:29] <+ericsoares23> as a benfica fan he hasn't necessarily been great in 2022
[2023-01-10 20:08:31] <+smokeymcpot_99> @mrfasth22 because it is
[2023-01-10 20:08:32] <AbdulTarar> sorare bias on this one i think
[2023-01-10 20:08:32] <%+kamsb24> Chelsea should of bought him
[2023-01-10 20:08:32] <@%+DavidMNobrega> Nearly every Benfica, Sporting and Porto player ends up at a big team in Europes top 5 anyway LUL
[2023-01-10 20:08:33] <jeffbob213> i mean they have alba
[2023-01-10 20:08:33] <+MasNLFC> @MasNLFC @nero_182 If Grimaldo is then so is Nunez
[2023-01-10 20:08:35] <+nelsonxo_99> biraghi should be a tier higher, rabiot at the bottom tier
[2023-01-10 20:08:36] <salah446333> because he's not that good
[2023-01-10 20:08:40] <afonso7010> Benfica was third
[2023-01-10 20:08:41] <%+kamsb24> United could get him tbh
[2023-01-10 20:08:42] <%+DirtyDishFC> Did Angelino even gett called when he was amazing
[2023-01-10 20:08:43] <+tomtaz10> Spanish coach was very biased
[2023-01-10 20:08:43] <maurits1019> NE YOUR TOXIC AGAIN
[2023-01-10 20:08:45] <%+tobywankenobi101> need a new tier in then, he's not on same level as silva
[2023-01-10 20:08:48] BAN: maurits1019
[2023-01-10 20:08:51] <%$BobbyTambling> grimaldo is in his prime and is still in portugal, i think thats enough to say
[2023-01-10 20:08:52] <%+callumalc7> Alba and balde are better imo
[2023-01-10 20:08:53] <chev096> People are forgetting Eredivisie is up there too
[2023-01-10 20:08:54] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> You can add a category. Check my cord
[2023-01-10 20:08:58] <saugatmessi> he had beef with luis enrique from barca days
[2023-01-10 20:09:00] <MarioBr0ther> Grimaldo had one foot out the door in the beginning of the season...
[2023-01-10 20:09:01] <%+wackyweebo> @dirtydishfc u clearly dont watch football then. messi has the most g/a in that psg team
[2023-01-10 20:09:02] <rubz3n> Porro > Grimaldo
[2023-01-10 20:09:04] <%+callumalc7> Balde is insane
[2023-01-10 20:09:04] <salah446333> if he was good the big teams would go for him
[2023-01-10 20:09:05] <%Rickz1999> grimaldo has been in benfica for years and years, and all  the year they say he leaves and he just doesnt have the quality
[2023-01-10 20:09:06] <+ericsoares23> Aas a benfica fan he hasn't necessarily been great in 2022
[2023-01-10 20:09:06] <%robo_cfc> @tobywankenobi101 none of the defenders are imo, silva best defender in 2022
[2023-01-10 20:09:08] <+leoxuakin> its not just the league. He's not that great
[2023-01-10 20:09:08] <shaunrussell> No

[2023-01-10 20:09:16] <afonso7010> Where is taremi , pepe, otavio and Diogo Costa?
[2023-01-10 20:09:17] <%Rickz1999> @MarioBr0ther he has all seasons since he joined and never leaves
[2023-01-10 20:09:17] <+ericsoares23> as a benfica fan he hasn't necessarily been great in 2022
[2023-01-10 20:09:21] <rietz> lmao

[2023-01-10 20:09:37] <+ruaraidhmair> grimaldo could play for majority of prem teams anyone who says differently is basing it on fifa not real life
[2023-01-10 20:09:39] <+smokeymcpot_99> French league is trash outside PSG tbh
[2023-01-10 20:09:40] <+xxmickey__mousexx> did grimaldo not get called up then got injured and replaced by balde?
[2023-01-10 20:09:41] <ev1955> Valencia is low ranked
[2023-01-10 20:09:46] <mcneill_92> 100% but the Madrid and Barca fanboys will disagree
[2023-01-10 20:09:46] <Robertogames64> Lol Laliga is better than the prem
[2023-01-10 20:09:47] <salah446333> so is the bundesliga
[2023-01-10 20:09:48] <ben032005> If Ronaldo scores 50 goals this year does he get in TOTY ?

[2023-01-10 20:09:50] <%$BobbyTambling> but people know ligue 1 teams, no one knows apart from Porto benfica in portugal
[2023-01-10 20:09:51] <boris37> you cant say you dont base it on opponents and then place Berghuis who has been the best player in the  dutch league at the bottom
[2023-01-10 20:09:52] <%+ddouglas14> Unlucky Josh LUL
[2023-01-10 20:09:54] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> But we can add a breah and be like "new category added this is whats happening"

[2023-01-10 20:10:55] <+ruaraidhmair> grimaldo plays for majority of prem teams
[2023-01-10 20:10:57] <chev096> Gakpo is best by far
[2023-01-10 20:10:59] <ussy12356> I do feel like voting for teams other than PL clubs is harder,  for people who only watch PL.
[2023-01-10 20:10:59] <%+kamsb24> Go on nep
[2023-01-10 20:10:59] <%$BobbyTambling> i know sporting, im talking about the vast majority. and sporting won the league title once in past 20 years, is that a big club right now? very mouch doubt it nep
[2023-01-10 20:11:01] <mrfasth22> jesper karlsson way better than berghuis for example
[2023-01-10 20:11:03] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> I think its all relative. If youre in a bad league, you have to absolutely slay
[2023-01-10 20:11:04] <ben032005> If Ronaldo scores 50 goals this year in the Saudi league does he get in TOTY?
[2023-01-10 20:11:07] <salah446333> fair enough
[2023-01-10 20:11:16] <denco5> I think you can say the same about the teams in the prem at the bottom of the table
[2023-01-10 20:11:16] <AHumanAlien> Where's Wrexham's Paul Mullin?
[2023-01-10 20:11:18] <The_Worst_Sin> Grimaldo is honourable mentions he has been absolutely fantastic this season
[2023-01-10 20:11:22] <nero_182> I agree with Nep
[2023-01-10 20:11:23] <%$J1___> thats fair enough
[2023-01-10 20:11:26] <+nelsonxo_99> it was more last season berghuis was amazing, gakpo this season
[2023-01-10 20:11:28] <%$Rocky94RPC> @bobbytambling sporting are a big club that’s an odd argument to make
[2023-01-10 20:11:28] <%FUTDAN26> The main thing I came away from the so far sorare podcast with, was I cannot believe people stand up to wipe. Asked some mates today at work and was shocked to find it was 50/50 😂
[2023-01-10 20:11:28] <+ruaraidhmair> can we add a grimaldo tier ????

[2023-01-10 20:11:39] <+SegaBoy1988> Berg 8 goals in 14 games for spurs he scored 7 in 61 games he is deffo one of the best in the dutch league
[2023-01-10 20:11:39] <boris37> has been for Feyenoord, was the only great player when Ajax had a form struggle, how much Akax have you watched?

[2023-01-10 20:11:50] <+ericsoares23> HM or average
[2023-01-10 20:11:53] <Gillzo> ederson extremely average

[2023-01-10 20:11:54] <%$bluemooner1990> He honestly isn't that good.
[2023-01-10 20:11:55] <AHumanAlien> Ederson could be crap, none of us know
[2023-01-10 20:11:55] <+smokeymcpot_99> Ederson is better than Alisson
[2023-01-10 20:11:56] <%LukePingu> ederson barely does anything
[2023-01-10 20:11:56] <+nelsonxo_99> ederson top tier
[2023-01-10 20:11:57] <ccuddy123> Cancelo only good for Man City
[2023-01-10 20:11:57] <ddelira_5> hm at most
[2023-01-10 20:11:58] <%+wackyweebo> ederson hm
[2023-01-10 20:11:58] <here4rewards_> Ederson is unused basically LUL
[2023-01-10 20:12:01] <ev1955> @ben032005  We have around 34 games and almost half is done so it’s very hard
[2023-01-10 20:12:03] <+nykangrygakpo13> ederson in average 100%
[2023-01-10 20:12:04] <lfcbobby01> @smokeymcpot_99 🤣🤣🤣🤣
[2023-01-10 20:12:06] <+MasNLFC> You can only judge players based on who they played, it shouldn't matter the level of opposition as long as it's the premium league in the country
[2023-01-10 20:12:07] <mrfasth22> even as a roma fan, immobile has to be higher tho...
[2023-01-10 20:12:09] <AHumanAlien> @smokeymcpot_99 Who started at the world cup?
[2023-01-10 20:12:13] <$Ethanrclarke> The lack of ball knowledge in this chat is unbelievable

[2023-01-10 20:12:15] <%+maxevans1234> ederson isnt actually that good at saves
[2023-01-10 20:12:16] <ColdHeart_Ablaze> <3 <3 BibleThump9we9ea nv
[2023-01-10 20:12:18] <gvm797> ederson is consistent but not outstanding bc city is too good
[2023-01-10 20:12:19] <salah446333> ederson can't be behind Martinez
[2023-01-10 20:12:19] <%Rickz1999> @BobbyTambling benfica with the biggest investiments ever in the league finished top3 twice in a row
[2023-01-10 20:12:20] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> I think category addition would be amazing for the video tbh
[2023-01-10 20:12:22] <rweet1178> even cancelo has been benched by a 18 yo academy full back recently
[2023-01-10 20:12:24] <nismo7866> put him more up average and do it like that
[2023-01-10 20:12:26] <%$bluemooner1990> Ederson is extremelyy good with distribution but shot stopping just isn't to tier.
[2023-01-10 20:12:33] <here4rewards_> cup
[2023-01-10 20:12:33] <hoffman__> if ederson is avg then so is Alisson imo
[2023-01-10 20:12:34] <+smokeymcpot_99> @ahumanalien is Richarlison better than Gabriel Jesus then? Silly logic
[2023-01-10 20:12:38] <MarioBr0ther> if Otamendi is in HM for the WC, then Cancelo doesn't deserve to be in TOTY since his WC was horrible
[2023-01-10 20:12:39] <Bazatelli> won the league UCL semi final
[2023-01-10 20:12:40] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> Read my cord message
[2023-01-10 20:12:41] <+ruaraidhmair> think son does deserve an HM, golden boot in prem?
[2023-01-10 20:12:44] <lfcbobby01> Ederson lucky to be nominated but he’s also better than Martinez so no idea why you’ve put him TOTY
[2023-01-10 20:12:45] <%$BobbyTambling> Instead of trying to understand the basic point you guys are going from one extreme to the other... grow up
[2023-01-10 20:12:47] <+SegaBoy1988> Neymar Jr what did he do the last year apart from dive dive and dive and get sent off and do his usual antics
[2023-01-10 20:12:48] <+nelsonxo_99> is there a link for this??
[2023-01-10 20:12:51] <lfcbobby01> @hoffman__ watch football
[2023-01-10 20:12:58] <+hicks166> prem golden boot average, harsh

[2023-01-10 20:13:13] <km411996> Whatever and like wherever you put a player someone in here will just cry and moan about where that player is
[2023-01-10 20:13:13] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> Decent

[2023-01-10 20:15:37] <jednotska> Koulibaly been dreadful at Chelsea
[2023-01-10 20:15:37] <+smokeymcpot_99> Bro Richarlison gets picked for Brazil over gabby Jesus doesn’t mean he’s better
[2023-01-10 20:15:38] <+DenizSeason> he was lucky to win it tbf, he was average at best
[2023-01-10 20:15:39] <%Rickz1999> otamendi only win in the last 3 years win only wc
[2023-01-10 20:15:42] <%robo_cfc> he almost cost arg
[2023-01-10 20:15:42] <salah446333> oh my god
[2023-01-10 20:15:42] <nep199> Because originally berghuis is a rw but the way ajax play berghuis plays in midfield for creativity
[2023-01-10 20:15:45] <holgerplate> Berghuis did
[2023-01-10 20:15:46] <yeet69lolz> Nep great thinking! Enjoying the tier list!
[2023-01-10 20:15:47] <+fordykyle1> was awful in the final
[2023-01-10 20:15:49] <%Rickz1999> Coates >>
[2023-01-10 20:15:51] <kirksnake25> drop koulidaddy imo. him and Silva worlds apart
[2023-01-10 20:15:51] <ev1955> Martiniz for 7 games better than bonu who had best keeper over courteous and had better stats in wc
[2023-01-10 20:15:52] <+Drodba7> Otamendi had a great World Cup.
[2023-01-10 20:15:53] <Nzgget> otamendi no I disagree
[2023-01-10 20:15:54] <%$BobbyTambling> Maybe in NL it's the same as England with favouritism ? like southgate picking CBs and not Tomori?
[2023-01-10 20:15:55] <yeb71> Didnt Trapp win the europa league
[2023-01-10 20:15:56] <%+Surrengar> @Rickz1999 bruh
[2023-01-10 20:15:56] <+smokeymcpot_99> Cristian Romero in toty
[2023-01-10 20:15:57] <MarioBr0ther> you put Cancelo in TOTY despite the fact he had an horrendous WC
[2023-01-10 20:15:59] <denco5> it's the nations manager preference who he calls up
[2023-01-10 20:16:01] <Kuhrim> otamendi was great idk what the chat is on about
[2023-01-10 20:16:02] <+AidanFitz25> otamendi is that guy
[2023-01-10 20:16:02] <dasuandrew> otamendi was a starter for the wc champion
[2023-01-10 20:16:03] <salah446333> what is wrong with you and benfica players?
[2023-01-10 20:16:06] <Andrelemos6> otamendi deserves to be in toty section to  be honest
[2023-01-10 20:16:08] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> Romero for me is HM, Ota is Top 4
[2023-01-10 20:16:10] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> *3
[2023-01-10 20:16:11] <fxJulian> but almost never boiled the spuds LuL
[2023-01-10 20:16:11] <+qwerty_jc> mine as well throw di maria in there then
[2023-01-10 20:16:12] <+Drodba7> People are overreacting. He was their consistent CB when others were replaced.
[2023-01-10 20:16:13] <+smokeymcpot_99> Get demichelis in
[2023-01-10 20:16:20] <Nzgget> otamendi was the worst performing Argentina player
[2023-01-10 20:16:20] <Razide_> nep can you unblock me on twitter its been like 8 years im an adult now also im sorry
[2023-01-10 20:16:21] <%+paulmc93> Romero was better in the WC than Otamendi
[2023-01-10 20:16:22] <ahkimizz> is vvd really that good ?
[2023-01-10 20:16:22] <+BarBers21> At that point Romero is honourable mention
[2023-01-10 20:16:23] <+sealdawg> He was not great in WC, plus Benfica are awful
[2023-01-10 20:16:27] <%+cocomonkye> Kroos, Van Djik, Lewa, Kouli, salah could all easily drop a tier
[2023-01-10 20:16:29] <deziixixv> Otamendi x silva
[2023-01-10 20:16:30] <+nelsonxo_99> @SpreadsheetFifa is there a link for this? :)
[2023-01-10 20:16:31] <+smokeymcpot_99> And Romero was better at the WC
[2023-01-10 20:16:31] <%Rickz1999> most of you dont even watch portuguese leage
[2023-01-10 20:16:31] <%+tobywankenobi101> nah romero top 3
[2023-01-10 20:16:34] <lfcbobby01> Get Martinez in there, great at pens at the WC but poor shot stopping in normal time. Average for Villa worth an honourable mention tho
[2023-01-10 20:16:35] <%$BobbyTambling> what does easy easy top 3 even me, i think it is very confusing
[2023-01-10 20:16:35] <joshlawn14> Agree with you nep
[2023-01-10 20:16:35] <here4rewards_> just look at Otamendis sorare scores.
[2023-01-10 20:16:35] <zaraankhan200> salah is over kroos bc kroos didn't do anything last season
[2023-01-10 20:16:39] <%EitchBee> PL bias
[2023-01-10 20:16:39] <%Rickz1999> he didnt nep
[2023-01-10 20:16:40] <+BarBers21> Romero was better than Otamendi
[2023-01-10 20:16:41] <Kuhrim> @sealdawg what?
[2023-01-10 20:16:43] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> Romero would be the best centre back in portugal
[2023-01-10 20:16:43] <korneelvw> @sealdawg you don't know ball
[2023-01-10 20:16:46] <MarioBr0ther> nah my dude, Benfica won fuck all in 2022
[2023-01-10 20:16:46] <lafletcha1123> Ben yedder should drop à tier
[2023-01-10 20:16:46] <%+tobywankenobi101> But romero been better than otamendi in wc
[2023-01-10 20:16:48] <+ericsoares23> @sealdawg how are benfica awful? LUL
[2023-01-10 20:16:49] <%Rickz1999> benfica has 0 trophies in last 2 years
[2023-01-10 20:16:54] <%+paulmc93> Where's Hakimi?
[2023-01-10 20:16:57] <salah446333> nep comon you don't watch liga nos
[2023-01-10 20:16:57] <seboliver12> why u bumming the portuguese league so much
[2023-01-10 20:16:58] <afonso7010> Benfica didn’t win anything
[2023-01-10 20:16:59] <+DenizSeason> these takes are mad but fair enough
[2023-01-10 20:16:59] <ussy12356> Exactly
[2023-01-10 20:17:00] <LasseLaursen03> nah man cant have romero and kane in the same category
[2023-01-10 20:17:00] <diogomles> otamendi did not won in portugal in 2022
[2023-01-10 20:17:03] <%Rickz1999> 3rd
[2023-01-10 20:17:03] <+sealdawg> Benfica are playing in terrible league
[2023-01-10 20:17:04] <MarioBr0ther> 3rd
[2023-01-10 20:17:05] <+ericsoares23> 3rd
[2023-01-10 20:17:06] <here4rewards_> they are 2 different type of CBs
[2023-01-10 20:17:06] <+smokeymcpot_99> Romero wasn’t even the best CB in Italy tbf
[2023-01-10 20:17:07] <%$BobbyTambling> Mbappe would be the best goalscorer in the Liga nos probably
[2023-01-10 20:17:07] <+fordykyle1> romero was better for Argentina, got 2 trophies
[2023-01-10 20:17:07] <boris37> winning trophies shouldnt be a criterium, its a teamsport
[2023-01-10 20:17:08] <AHumanAlien> Harry Maguire would be the 3rd best defender in MLS
[2023-01-10 20:17:08] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> No so I judge on the comp they both played in. The WC. Romero carried ard
[2023-01-10 20:17:11] <Nzgget> Otamendi poor WC
[2023-01-10 20:17:12] <+stackmillz> otemendi was a stud the whole wc

[2023-01-10 20:17:27] <+TimmyLH44> Romero is levels above there’s a reason Argentina have won everything since he started playing
[2023-01-10 20:17:29] <Andrelemos6> they are the best this year

[2023-01-10 20:17:33] <Robertogames64> Romero was fantastic
[2023-01-10 20:17:35] <spyroluxx> Romero was benched for Martinez

[2023-01-10 20:21:06] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> @BobbyTambling Mane I think should be HM. Liverpool dropped off hard. Griez is touch and go for me. Tough to be TOTY when you had to come off the bench regardless of why. Salah I think is Easy top 3. Terrible year for him

[2023-01-10 20:21:50] <denco5> some of the players you have in toty section are there because of team achievements and some are beacuse of them individually
[2023-01-10 20:21:50] <+smokeymcpot_99> Enzo Fernandez for ballon d’or
[2023-01-10 20:21:50] <AHumanAlien> He was injured to be fair to Maddison

[2023-01-10 20:22:19] <calsimpsoni> Do agree with u mate, only would say Madders would definitely injured, because didn’t even come back to feature for Leicester, he wasn’t fit
[2023-01-10 20:22:21] <%$BobbyTambling> @BobbyTambling @SpreadsheetFifa you see, you're giving very different reasons for why each player should be where, but for Koulibaly you're saying he should just drop because he's been bad for chelsea, which he has been as a chelsea fan, but ur not considering everything else he did in 2022
[2023-01-10 20:22:21] <%+utdlnterest> Tripper was shit last season until he joined Newcastle so he won’t get it

[2023-01-10 20:25:13] <%+cbray94> Alaba and rudiger not getting a toty nom but biraghi and sule did is a joke.
[2023-01-10 20:25:17] <+csnolan175> @bluemooner1990 hes not had though. people have just started attacking his defending which seems to have made everyone think he's worse than before
[2023-01-10 20:25:17] <%$bluemooner1990> @SpreadsheetFifa Agree with everything aside from Griez but that said, I'm looking predominantly at the WC.
[2023-01-10 20:25:20] <+smokeymcpot_99> @whufcconnor it’s team of the year though not team of the last 5 games
[2023-01-10 20:25:29] <%Rickz1999> same with grimaldo nep

[2023-01-10 20:25:53] <%$bluemooner1990> @csnolan175 Nah, his defending has always been shit. But his attacking play has dropped off too and I think that's why the defending has been picked up on more now lol
[2023-01-10 20:25:54] <+leoxuakin> Spain still plays Alba. They are not that deep at LB
[2023-01-10 20:25:56] <bugly69> ederson should be in honourable mention is not his fault that alisson is in brazil
[2023-01-10 20:25:57] <%Rickz1999> i mean, i think grimaldo is better then jordi alba
[2023-01-10 20:26:02] <Bazatelli> Won the Euros tho
[2023-01-10 20:26:05] <%+tobywankenobi101> lost to north maccedonia wasn't it?
[2023-01-10 20:26:06] <%$BobbyTambling> Jordi Alba and ?
[2023-01-10 20:26:09] <@%+DavidMNobrega> I've seen plenty of top tier players not get called up to their national team, Argentina have been one in the past who have left insane players out because their management bias
[2023-01-10 20:26:09] <%Rickz1999> and yet he wasnt called
[2023-01-10 20:26:09] <%+Gworv> european champions italy u mean?
[2023-01-10 20:26:10] <%kinglester2692> spain are going for youth

[2023-01-10 20:26:33] <@sorarejosh> makes u wonder why southgate didnt start trippier every game
[2023-01-10 20:26:35] <%Rickz1999> and in my opinion grimaldo deserved to be called
[2023-01-10 20:26:36] <+csnolan175> @bluemooner1990 1 on 1 he's actually good, its when its over the shoulder that he struggles
[2023-01-10 20:26:37] <rubz3n> Porro can do the left as well

[2023-01-10 20:27:05] <JenNettaliaLP> Bruno was one ofe the top 3 rating for the WC I think. Was clearly portugal's best player

[2023-01-10 20:27:30] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> Top 3 is kind. Between there and average for sure
[2023-01-10 20:27:30] <boris37> berchiche has been shit, balder has been playing for half a year and gaya waa injured, while grimaldo has been on steroids as you said, and he still didnt get called up
[2023-01-10 20:27:30] <%$bluemooner1990> @csnolan175 Yeah but that's quite a big part of being a FB/WB. He's a big guy, he's quick. It's just a lack of awareness most of the time. He's frustrating to watch. I'm a City lad obvs but my step dad is L'pool so watch quite a bit

[2023-01-10 20:27:37] <+giuseppe_esq> I think you’re forgetting that football works in cycles.  Italy were excellent in the Euros, with many players peaking towards the end of their careers.  Italy will rebuild, and improve.  They have some excellent players coming through.

[2023-01-10 20:50:21] <+slipz_envy> ur just wrong
[2023-01-10 20:50:21] <stinglucas> theo walcott
[2023-01-10 20:50:21] <hectormee> Atm saka better
[2023-01-10 20:50:22] <alexvz1008> Son has been brilliant for 6 years in a row bro @nepenthez
[2023-01-10 20:50:22] <%+m0ng00se44> This is 2022 performance not building for the future!!!
[2023-01-10 20:50:22] <S1m95on> LUL
[2023-01-10 20:50:24] <@%CaniSports> Nah honestly Son is different levels for years over years for a shite side
[2023-01-10 20:50:24] <dynamoparko> it's not a measure of form lol
[2023-01-10 20:50:24] <bandzz234> only an Arsenal fan would take Saka let's be real
[2023-01-10 20:50:25] <%+Gworv> spurs are my second team, still taking saka
[2023-01-10 20:50:25] <+rasbootz> just height lol
[2023-01-10 20:50:25] <kevkenna> Tomori higher
[2023-01-10 20:50:26] <%hazzat1345> Son all day
[2023-01-10 20:50:26] <%$BobbyTambling> if we're picking fifa cards ill go son
[2023-01-10 20:50:27] <younis_raja8> I would take Nelson over son tbh
[2023-01-10 20:50:27] <+ericsoares23> saka is better.
[2023-01-10 20:50:28] <%$KopiteJosh> I'd take Saka cos of his age and current form
[2023-01-10 20:50:31] <Zinidiz254> This season he kinda sprung into stardom
[2023-01-10 20:50:31] <+sealdawg> Saka technically poor
[2023-01-10 20:50:32] <%+kdmjaffa> Cz that's what Gareth Southgate does 🤣🤣
[2023-01-10 20:50:35] <%whufcconnor> whaaa?
[2023-01-10 20:50:36] <+memphisdepie88> I'm a neutral, id take son overall. son has a dip but is proven world class. saka not yet at that level but will be
[2023-01-10 20:50:37] <%+tobywankenobi101> odegaard only one you can claim being up there
[2023-01-10 20:50:38] <%+m0ng00se44> This is 2022 performance not building for the future!
[2023-01-10 20:50:39] <rweet1178> not including footballing ability, Son
[2023-01-10 20:50:39] <korneelvw> Yeah right now Saka but if they are both inform without thinking Son
[2023-01-10 20:50:40] <MrPapichulo__> Son is better than saka discussion finished

[2023-01-10 20:50:50] <kevkenna> Tomori won league with AC
[2023-01-10 20:50:51] <%$BobbyTambling> Saka is better than mount sadly, and i love mount to bits
[2023-01-10 20:50:51] <%+bazzay10> this is all about a year of being inform lol
[2023-01-10 20:50:52] <%+tobywankenobi101> saka good but not up there
[2023-01-10 20:50:53] <rahh_kage> Bro Son easiest decision of my life
[2023-01-10 20:50:56] <tescosleo> that's like saying I'd pick ronaldo over haaland rn not based on form😭
[2023-01-10 20:50:58] <MarioBr0ther> Saka is younger and has room to improve so I would take him, whilst Son is quality but in his 30's so he doesn't have that many more seasons at top level
[2023-01-10 20:50:58] <+smokeymcpot_99> No pro footballers are technically poor
[2023-01-10 20:50:58] <+rasbootz> saka is like messi with keeping the ball
[2023-01-10 20:50:59] <XBEvan> gotta ban him for that take lol
[2023-01-10 20:50:59] <+LincsyTTV> Sakas one of the best players in england right now

[2023-01-10 20:51:12] <bugly69> ederson should be in honourable mention name me another keeper to get assist and clean sheets in the same game
[2023-01-10 20:51:12] <+knaztah> without bias i would say Son by far.

[2023-01-10 21:03:57] <sat390> Pep always plays Foden out of position and he still performs
[2023-01-10 21:03:58] <%$bluemooner1990> Maybe, it's a tight one I think

[2023-01-10 21:03:59] <MarioBr0ther> Bruno had a brilliant WC tbf
[2023-01-10 21:04:00] <+zack2000> kulu shouldn't be higher than dembele
[2023-01-10 21:04:02] <heltoft> gakpo HM
[2023-01-10 21:04:11] <%suraj672004> trippier above rodri, bellingham?
[2023-01-10 21:04:11] <+1predz> if the arsenal boys and rice are the i believe fodon should
[2023-01-10 21:04:13] <makobenblessing> Fair enough G
[2023-01-10 21:04:13] <deziixixv> foden like pedri bit overated
[2023-01-10 21:04:17] <%$yinka21> I think Dembele should be top 3 considering he had the top 3 assists in 2022 and played very well for Barca
[2023-01-10 21:04:18] <S1m95on> I can totally see why Nep put Trippier TOTY, just me personally, would put him HM
[2023-01-10 21:04:18] <Zinidiz254> @bateson87 bates!!!
[2023-01-10 21:04:32] <%Rickz1999> this is not toty
[2023-01-10 21:04:33] <%+mattw_uk_99> Foden was HM last year and arguably better this year
[2023-01-10 21:04:33] <Kareemoo0> what ødegaard have over foden ?
[2023-01-10 21:04:37] <@%$ItsTr3ple> Ousmane did well for France aprt fro mthe final
[2023-01-10 21:04:39] <%Rickz1999> this is team of the last 4 months tbh
[2023-01-10 21:04:42] <%+tobywankenobi101> only cause he plays for spurs people hate on him. Deki been class, missing piece for spurs this season
[2023-01-10 21:04:45] <jxmes2134> Pretty Good list tbf
[2023-01-10 21:04:47] <korneelvw> The only thing I would change is Bernardo in TOTY.
[2023-01-10 21:04:48] <%$bluemooner1990> @Kareemoo0 Arsenal, tongue in cheek haha
[2023-01-10 21:04:54] <%+maxevans1234> they were trying to force him out cuz of how bad he was for barca
[2023-01-10 21:04:54] <+1predz> u moved foden up
[2023-01-10 21:05:05] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> Maybe do chat can change one rating?
[2023-01-10 21:05:07] <%+insomnixc__> Odegard has been world class this season

[2023-01-10 21:05:12] <+m1lezy> Do you think there is a potential for Gvardiol to be a TOTY? He has been outstanding for club and country for a while now
[2023-01-10 21:05:17] <ahsantariqmajeed> why Martinez is in TOTY?
[2023-01-10 21:05:17] <%ItsYaBoyArteta> Chat please LUL LUL LUL

[2023-01-10 21:05:27] <%Rickz1999> i mean that like most of the nominies had a bad 1st half of the year and still got in
[2023-01-10 21:05:29] <jxmes2134> Maybe felix in top 3 if Nunez is their
[2023-01-10 21:05:30] <@%+DavidMNobrega> For me the worst one in this is Fofana
[2023-01-10 21:05:31] <%+mikekozy23> messi to why are you there imo
[2023-01-10 21:05:34] <+chefbisi> militao needs to be toty
[2023-01-10 21:05:34] <jamaicann9> Tomori not in second tier is a crime

[2023-01-10 21:05:40] <@%$ItsTr3ple> The only change i would make is Fofana up to average
[2023-01-10 21:05:42] <+tomtaz10> only one I would change is Kulusevski
[2023-01-10 21:05:48] <%whufcconnor> dont agree? make your own
[2023-01-10 21:05:49] <MarceloBielsa105678> Trippier lol

[2023-01-10 21:06:26] <%+kdmjaffa> Saka should be TOTY
[2023-01-10 21:06:33] <keith_mercer89> Saka should be Honourable's he shouldn't be TOTY
[2023-01-10 21:06:35] <%+mikekozy23> saka was actually so good at WC
[2023-01-10 21:06:37] <%suraj672004> trips toty is outrageous relative to where other players stand rn imo neppo
[2023-01-10 21:06:38] <S1m95on> Gakpo insane G/A and couple of WC goals too
[2023-01-10 21:06:40] <%+paulmc93> dannya6Kulusevski is the goat 🐐
[2023-01-10 21:06:41] <%+originalmorris8> saka could be in toty been great
[2023-01-10 21:06:42] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> Saka was statistically englands best player at WC
[2023-01-10 21:06:45] <ahsantariqmajeed> we should also consider the impact of that player on his club @NepentheZ

[2023-01-10 21:06:46] <%Rickz1999> i dont think that saka and salah should be in the same
[2023-01-10 21:06:51] <Zinidiz254> If saka is HM, foden has to be HM
[2023-01-10 21:06:55] <dave2batty> gvardiol toty?
[2023-01-10 21:06:57] <+andrewztbh> Saka is no way ahead of both Pedri and Foden
[2023-01-10 21:06:57] <%$Rocky94RPC> Saka toty defo for me
[2023-01-10 21:06:58] <%suraj672004> no one likes spurs thats why
[2023-01-10 21:07:00] <%+mikekozy23> i almost put saka into my actual vote, but there's just a good number of guys at the next level
[2023-01-10 21:07:08] <%$Rocky94RPC> @zinidiz254 Saka been better tho
[2023-01-10 21:07:08] <%Rickz1999> @SpreadsheetFifa bruno was one of the best players in the whole world cup and only top3
[2023-01-10 21:07:11] <tossedrhino> Thiago silva shouldn’t be an honorable mention. Chelsea defense is worse with him
[2023-01-10 21:07:11] <+sealdawg> Kulu has to be why there
[2023-01-10 21:07:14] <%+kdmjaffa> If Nunez is there then Kulu should be
[2023-01-10 21:07:15] <%kinglester2692> jude has been better the saka imo
[2023-01-10 21:07:18] <jasha1988> even kulusewski dont know why hes there
[2023-01-10 21:07:19] <george11i> Hakimi hasn’t been good for psg
[2023-01-10 21:07:20] <+the_pojk> kulu easily toty
[2023-01-10 21:07:23] <+aliwakkas7> he's been incredible for Spurs when he plays
[2023-01-10 21:07:26] <%$bluemooner1990> @Rickz1999 But not great for United really.
[2023-01-10 21:07:29] <Zinidiz254> Saka over Bellingham as England’s best player is crazy neppo
[2023-01-10 21:07:33] <+WelflexHD> He transforms tottenham as a team, like them or not
[2023-01-10 21:07:33] <rweet1178> @tossedrhino now that is the worst opinion of the day
[2023-01-10 21:07:34] <%+Thealwaysfeared> kulu is literally the reason why spurs win games

[2023-01-10 21:07:43] <@%$ItsTr3ple> Bentancur
[2023-01-10 21:07:43] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> @SpreadsheetFifa Because outside of the WC he was gossage. I would also argue he wasnt close to one fo the best players at WC. But its TOTY, not just WC
[2023-01-10 21:07:43] <%Rickz1999> @bluemooner1990 he was like half of the year
[2023-01-10 21:07:44] <%empastoner> Kulusevskiand Bentancur the best in Spurs

[2023-01-10 21:07:44] <%+tobywankenobi101> deki been great for spurs. people only don't rate his cause he plays for spurs. missing piece for us this season

[2023-01-10 21:08:14] <%$bluemooner1990> @Rickz1999 Shown flashes and passion but nothing like season before.
[2023-01-10 21:08:17] <%Rickz1999> @bluemooner1990 he had a overall better year then saka
[2023-01-10 21:08:21] <+cabraljose1998> Think militao deserves toty for the ucl plus his world cup playing out of position
[2023-01-10 21:08:26] <+sealdawg> V good player, but not outstanding to be in this debate
[2023-01-10 21:08:27] <dom01010> But Kostic won Europa league and has Juve back near the top of serie a, Kulu shouldn’t be higher than him
[2023-01-10 21:08:34] <paulro19> Kulu on Juve you’d have in average lol

[2023-01-10 21:09:17] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> Cancelo and KDB could be knocked down. KDB had a shocker world cup. Cancelo was kept out of Portugal by Dalot
[2023-01-10 21:09:19] <ZeroCams> Messi wasn't nominated for ballon d'or
[2023-01-10 21:09:20] <Dash_counter7> Courtois carried real madrid
[2023-01-10 21:09:21] <%$bluemooner1990> @Rickz1999 I think that's extremely debateable, it's tough because it depends what you're basing it on. Importance to the team, it's level. Consistency has to go to Saka though imo.
[2023-01-10 21:09:21] <%+mikekozy23> Good? he won the world cup
[2023-01-10 21:09:22] <%Rickz1999> i think messi should be the 12th player
[2023-01-10 21:09:23] <%ItsYaBoyArteta> I voted kdb Casemiro and mane above modric JUST
[2023-01-10 21:09:27] <%+tobywankenobi101> messi on fire in the league and just won the world cup........
[2023-01-10 21:09:28] <Mcr_xMaYheMx> cassemero is a dead cert imo
[2023-01-10 21:09:35] <%+gpnick7> trippier is a surt he is incredible and the best def in the lg
[2023-01-10 21:09:37] <%+mikekozy23> "good" = wins world cup
[2023-01-10 21:09:39] <ZeroCams> Messi wasn't nominated for ballon d'or though
[2023-01-10 21:09:39] <ThmsHrpr> As a liverpool fan, I think Saka get's slept on so much because of his off the ball work. He contributes so much in the press and his own half but people only want to compare his goals and assist (which are also great btw) but he's brilliantly well rounded. Fantastic for England and Arsenal but because he's not flashy, many ignore his quality
[2023-01-10 21:09:42] <deziixixv> g x a tax
[2023-01-10 21:09:43] <jezfi> Benzema scored 15 in the UCL and 27 in La Liga and won them both. He has to be in.
[2023-01-10 21:09:44] <keith_mercer89> For a 35 year old Messi, he's had fantastic year
[2023-01-10 21:09:47] <+zack2000> Messi has the most goal contributions in the world lol
[2023-01-10 21:09:49] <+ibrahimkhan3> i feel like the midfield choice is hard to pick however id love to know your reasoning to pick kimmich

[2023-01-10 21:10:22] <%Rickz1999> we have to get the champions league counting as well
[2023-01-10 21:10:23] <@%$ItsTr3ple> As an avid Ligue 1 watcher, Messi has been average FOR HIS STANDARDS in the first part of the year, but his standards are so high that he deserves TOTY either way
[2023-01-10 21:10:23] <ng5matty97> you only have 1 cb in toty?
[2023-01-10 21:10:26] <dave2batty> how is gvardiol not in toty
[2023-01-10 21:10:32] <+1predz> messi has been better this season then last
[2023-01-10 21:10:37] <%Rickz1999> @ItsTr3ple i think he should be the 12th man
[2023-01-10 21:10:39] <keith_mercer89> It's nice not to see Ronaldo in TOTY this year
[2023-01-10 21:10:41] <deziixixv> hes baiting
[2023-01-10 21:10:42] <+ismilann> BRO HOW ARE PEOPLE DEBATING MESSI?
[2023-01-10 21:10:42] <jasha1988> he started olaying really good for psg att the start of this season
[2023-01-10 21:10:49] <JenNettaliaLP> Doesnt messi have far more MOTM than the others on PSG this year?
[2023-01-10 21:10:50] <%robo_cfc> 100% bait
[2023-01-10 21:10:51] <+sealdawg> Messi is the whole team of the team on his own
[2023-01-10 21:10:54] <JenNettaliaLP> or 22 i mean
[2023-01-10 21:10:54] <%Rickz1999> ronaldo was good in the 1st half and bad on the second
[2023-01-10 21:11:03] <i_kyrie> No question about it ! Messi has to be in the toty
[2023-01-10 21:11:06] <%+DirtyDishFC> fbref
[2023-01-10 21:11:06] <+ismilann> Messi is the POTY

[2023-01-10 21:11:30] <oscar_wildenight> Count from TransferMarkt. @NepentheZ
[2023-01-10 21:11:34] <@%$ItsTr3ple> As an avid Ligue 1 watcher, Messi has been average FOR HIS STANDARDS in the first part of the year, but his standards are so high that he deserves TOTY either way
[2023-01-10 21:11:38] <+nemesiscallumv316> Chat come on this is not even a debate. Messi has be unreal
[2023-01-10 21:11:43] <%+robertovidal46> Im a Bayern fan and would love a Kimmich TOTY, but it would not really be deserved
[2023-01-10 21:11:50] <%Rickz1999> @bluemooner1990 i think they are better without ronaldo 100%

[2023-01-10 21:13:08] <kizza_leo> if his name wasn't Messi and it was any other name or player with those stats you would 100% pick him its just because its Messi and his standards are so high 👍
