[2023-01-02 02:36:15] <@%mrkmattos> i know a lot of creators mute vs clock to not give people the satisfaction, but blocking is superior

[2023-01-02 02:36:17] <%Vectralpb> Indeed
[2023-01-02 02:36:20] <%markpygas> Muting them is better imo, they still mad at you but you can‚Äôt see it so they get madder

[2023-01-02 03:03:53] <%zorg666> Aria you need to change the refresh rate in the windows display settings, they usually default to 60hz even on high refresh rate monitors

[2023-01-02 03:04:15] <Aegatron> why windowed :p
[2023-01-02 03:04:16] <%Vectralpb> @AriaSaki Check Windows settings, it might've defaulted at 60Hz instead of 165Hz, most monitors do that out of the box
[2023-01-02 03:04:17] <%markpygas> Your 2080 will catch on fire if it tries 8k
[2023-01-02 03:04:18] <Klyerr_> you already change refresh rate in settings?
[2023-01-02 03:04:25] <emaher> what are specs of pc than

[2023-01-02 03:04:32] <%JamilTDavis> Should be set to borderless windowed so you can swap between monitors.  You‚Äôll need to set the monitor and game to the same resolution.
[2023-01-02 03:04:33] <%zorg666> @AriaSaki change the refresh rate in the windows display settings, they usually default to 60hz even on high refresh rate monitors

[2023-01-02 03:05:31] <+Zoun19> the monitor should have a setting for ms
[2023-01-02 03:05:32] <%+TacosForJesus> this ain't it chief, you will want it fullscreen
[2023-01-02 03:05:35] <%fatguy925> Have you tried setting it to Wombo /s
[2023-01-02 03:05:37] <Yuniecorn> Does OW show you your fps?
[2023-01-02 03:05:48] <+Zoun19> 1ms should look like it has after image if that is an IPS monitor
[2023-01-02 03:05:51] <+zabi_vt> video -> details show fps
[2023-01-02 03:05:53] <%tripletoruses> it's a 40 in. screen, she does NOT need fullscreen
[2023-01-02 03:05:54] <%+TacosForJesus> no, the resolution isn't that much better
[2023-01-02 03:05:57] <%trixxiev> What is she trying to do?
[2023-01-02 03:05:59] <@%jojoppa> chat you have to understand she only plays in windowed mode
[2023-01-02 03:06:01] <+mooovee_> happy new year aria
[2023-01-02 03:06:01] <calypsonite> yeah fullscreen for the best experience

[2023-01-02 03:06:08] <Aegatron> but on your monitor right now, how much of it displays the game
[2023-01-02 03:06:11] <calypsonite> I think you'd like it fullscreen after a bit
[2023-01-02 03:06:11] <GinHongFat> Fullscreen borderless, I been playing this competitive so...
[2023-01-02 03:06:12] <+Darkmet96> full screen for the best FPS experience
[2023-01-02 03:06:13] <%demonstasis> fullscreen borderless
[2023-01-02 03:06:15] <%Vectralpb> @AriaSaki Check the Windows settings as well. It's in Display settings, Advanced Display settings, Refresh Rate
[2023-01-02 03:06:17] <ArthurHengCH> play ow on her new monitor

[2023-01-02 03:06:23] <Dokkeshi> Fullscreen is the best so the graphics card don't have a hard time to render exclusively
[2023-01-02 03:06:24] <%Psychosist> fullscreen isnt always better on a big monitor bc youll have to move your eyes more
[2023-01-02 03:06:26] <%zorg666> @jojoppa high refresh rate works way less well in windowed mode sadly
[2023-01-02 03:06:27] <Klyerr_> it's on framerate
[2023-01-02 03:06:28] <+Darkmet96> wow...
[2023-01-02 03:06:28] <+jimdizzle> to check your Hz - out of OW, right click desktop > display settings > select main monitor > scroll down to advance options to check hz
[2023-01-02 03:06:31] <calypsonite> no troll D:
[2023-01-02 03:06:39] <Aegatron> ye but she dont want fullscreen cuz its to big for her haha
[2023-01-02 03:06:41] <Mitzki> windowed mode = input lag
[2023-01-02 03:06:43] <%zorg666> high refresh rate is kind of buggy in windowed mode sadly
[2023-01-02 03:06:48] <zorba___> im not sure you can go windowed and drag it center with overwatch
[2023-01-02 03:06:51] <+Markivory> First Make sure you have it set to max hz | Display settings > Advanced Display settings > Refresh rate
[2023-01-02 03:06:52] <+zabi_vt> that will show fps if you hit apply

[2023-01-02 03:07:33] <+zabi_vt> it locks at 60 at menu
[2023-01-02 03:07:37] <%Vectralpb> That's probably just locked in the menu
[2023-01-02 03:07:37] <+Markivory> you guys are giving her mixed info
[2023-01-02 03:07:37] <+Cocotao> It's only in the menu that it's caped
[2023-01-02 03:07:39] <%alanheatwave95> for the FPS check it during game
[2023-01-02 03:07:39] <GinHongFat> I can help with tech
[2023-01-02 03:07:40] <Aegatron> fps gets better ingame if im not wrong
[2023-01-02 03:07:40] <@%mrkmattos> as a streamer that multitasks and alt tabs, it's probably better you be on windowed
[2023-01-02 03:07:44] <Yuniecorn> 60 fps in the menu is normal!
[2023-01-02 03:07:44] <Garfield2k> what you changing?
[2023-01-02 03:07:54] <%FSIdentitY> if you wanna divide the giant monitor into sections later you can get Microsoft PowerToys
[2023-01-02 03:08:02] <Aegatron> try some games now peepoClap
[2023-01-02 03:08:03] <Shad0mega> there is something also about precise aim capturing that might help
[2023-01-02 03:08:08] <+Markivory> First Make sure you have it set to max hz | Display settings > Advanced Display settings > Refresh rate
[2023-01-02 03:08:10] <+feartoosneaky> @mrkmattos if you need to alt tab a lot fullscreen borderless is better
[2023-01-02 03:08:11] <+zabi_vt> i put everything on low with nvidia + boost

[2023-01-02 03:11:27] <misterbananas> did you enabled your monitor to run 165hz on windows display properties?
[2023-01-02 03:11:32] <@%mrkmattos> in fullscreen

[2023-01-02 03:11:38] <%demonstasis> borderless allows you to mouse to other monitors
[2023-01-02 03:11:40] <overwatchenjoyer21> borderless window makes a difference to removing the white area near the top of your screen
[2023-01-02 03:11:40] <%+TacosForJesus> borderless window is fine, just don't scale down the window to make the game smaller lol
[2023-01-02 03:11:42] <Klyerr_> @misterbananas Yes
[2023-01-02 03:11:42] <%+DiegoNepo> you can try fullscreen once at least

[2023-01-02 03:14:55] <overwatchenjoyer21> hey aria how long do you think this stream would last for? I have the pose but not the skin.
[2023-01-02 03:14:56] <i_hate_erobb> that crosshair deadass
[2023-01-02 03:14:57] <Aegatron> looks fine to me
[2023-01-02 03:15:10] <%demonstasis> @zorg666 might need to let it free was what i was thinking, for the sync
[2023-01-02 03:15:14] <+D4NZYY> it's perfect now
[2023-01-02 03:15:21] <%RC_2> i think the new monitor makes the game more immersive for her

[2023-01-02 03:15:21] <Aegatron> had some lags before but updated 10times :p
[2023-01-02 03:15:22] <%svenphen> It's because stream output is still likely 60. So we're only getting 1 out of every 2.6 or so frames.
[2023-01-02 03:15:24] <%Vectralpb> lol it's not that LUL
[2023-01-02 03:15:25] <Dokkeshi> Bitrate can't keep up with that
[2023-01-02 03:15:25] <%zorg666> no the stream is 30fps
[2023-01-02 03:15:25] <Aegatron> and now is great
[2023-01-02 03:15:27] <%zeryn00> no you're fine aria, it's us peasants
[2023-01-02 03:15:28] <@%mrkmattos> ?
[2023-01-02 03:15:34] <%zorg666> your stream is 30fps
[2023-01-02 03:15:34] <%Vectralpb> The stream is 30 that is why
[2023-01-02 03:15:35] <misterbananas> its fine to me. the stream's output is limited to 30fps so its not an issue
[2023-01-02 03:15:37] <%Vectralpb> 30fps*
[2023-01-02 03:15:40] <Klyerr_> KEKW
[2023-01-02 03:15:46] <calypsonite> seems ok to me
[2023-01-02 03:15:48] <%alanheatwave95> LUL 30 fps?
[2023-01-02 03:15:53] <%zorg666> you should change your stream to 60fps
[2023-01-02 03:15:58] <%Vectralpb> I noticed that last few streams but always forget to ask lol
[2023-01-02 03:16:02] <%demonstasis> set 1080/60
[2023-01-02 03:16:08] <Yuniecorn> Its an obs/twitch thing, twitch is capped at 60 fps, and 165 doesnt evenly divide into 60. So it will stutter
[2023-01-02 03:16:09] <%zorg666> but that requires you to restart stream
[2023-01-02 03:16:10] <+schmidt55> @AriaSaki just be careful some of these settings increase your cpu temp up quite a bit
[2023-01-02 03:16:12] <%+mysticangel18> that might actually be it
[2023-01-02 03:16:20] <Aegatron> ye we see 30fps but you have to restart stream im pretty sure
[2023-01-02 03:16:27] <mangomilkshakestraw> why you siting like that

[2023-01-02 03:16:53] <Aegatron> do you know how to change it to 60?
[2023-01-02 03:16:54] <%Vini_Sensei> good for me too
[2023-01-02 03:16:58] <%+DiegoNepo> yeah, your stream has been set to 30 fps for a while now
[2023-01-02 03:16:59] <misterbananas> its fine tbh
[2023-01-02 03:16:59] <%+mysticangel18> its gonna reset stream just a heads up

[2023-01-02 03:17:29] <Yuniecorn> 60 fps!
[2023-01-02 03:17:31] <Adithya__> z OOOO rg
[2023-01-02 03:17:32] <%Vectralpb> no fps is capped to 60
[2023-01-02 03:17:36] <%Vectralpb> Just resolution
[2023-01-02 03:17:39] <%zorg666> yes you can go to 60 fps
[2023-01-02 03:17:40] <Aegatron> yes thats right, but set 60 and we ae good
[2023-01-02 03:17:43] <%+youknow_> hiii @AriaSaki hiii everyone! happy new year ariaHi
[2023-01-02 03:17:44] <PopleV_> fps can go higher than 30
[2023-01-02 03:17:56] <%+DiegoNepo> the resolution will stay at 1920x1080 but you can change your fps to 60
[2023-01-02 03:17:57] <misterbananas> i dont think twitch allows more than 60fps because of bandwidth issues
[2023-01-02 03:17:57] <Aegatron> no 60is max
[2023-01-02 03:18:07] <+D4NZYY> you can change your video settings to output at 60 fps which should clear up the issues
[2023-01-02 03:18:09] <esmojinx> omg that s weird how healers can dodge u and forget to heal
[2023-01-02 03:18:11] <%demonstasis> @youknow_ ariaHi
[2023-01-02 03:18:15] <%Vectralpb> I've seen 1440p60 on a few streams but those are experimental iirc
[2023-01-02 03:18:18] <Dokkeshi> Unranked randoms are better than your ranked randoms HypeScream
[2023-01-02 03:18:20] <+D4NZYY> @AriaSaki whats the new monitor
[2023-01-02 03:18:22] <%JamilTDavis> Yep, there are higher settings.  I usually do 1080 at 60fps, but have seen higher settings.
[2023-01-02 03:18:41] <%Vectralpb> Yep

[2023-01-02 03:18:48] <%zorg666> yes do 1080 at 60 fps
[2023-01-02 03:18:49] <+D4NZYY> 1080 at 60
[2023-01-02 03:18:50] <%+mysticangel18> 1080 60
[2023-01-02 03:19:01] <%Vectralpb> @Aegatron Indeed, Twitch needs to hurry up with the AV1 LUL
[2023-01-02 03:19:05] <Aegatron> 1080p 60 is best you can
[2023-01-02 03:19:07] <%+mysticangel18> that's about the max in yt
[2023-01-02 03:19:09] <%Vectralpb> the AV1 implementation*
[2023-01-02 03:19:20] <misterbananas> if you want. 1080/30 is fine for the most part
[2023-01-02 03:19:24] <Aegatron> @Vectralpb cant wait for 4k on twitch! would be sick :D

[2023-01-02 03:20:05] <%zorg666> @Vectralpb twitch isnt gonna bother with AV1 until lots of phones and laptop iGPUs have hardware decoding for it

[2023-01-02 04:15:32] <%zorg666> @BenWithVees they do, but if they make estimated tax payments (which technically they are supposed, but many probably dont) then would maybe be able to get a return

[2023-01-02 12:32:44] <esmojinx> @azisco i feel like sigma counters quite a lot of tanks
[2023-01-02 12:32:49] <%+Weisz__> the healers have almost as much damage as the tank. that's not good.
[2023-01-02 12:32:51] <RuraI_> Idk the moira has been dying a lot could be either tank not front lining or dps not getting picks orrrr this moira is actually just terrible
[2023-01-02 12:33:00] <+ThePlaymaker13> he has 10 deaths he's just dieing
[2023-01-02 12:33:00] <TheGuyHeretic> there's still hope if he swaps to Orisa

[2023-01-02 12:34:19] <RuraI_> I think this is a tank issue

[2023-01-02 12:54:44] <resetreptiles> Her biggest fault is that she has to jump into a group of people to get value and then she's stuck there with no way out for several seconds. She needs an additional ability or something
[2023-01-02 12:54:49] <+ThePlaymaker13> Dva is mid tier tank right now. She's better than JQ, Ball, Doom, & Zyra. Below the others though.

[2023-01-02 12:57:35] <Azisco> Yeah
[2023-01-02 12:57:35] <overwatchenjoyer21> aria your neck brace
[2023-01-02 12:57:42] <lmArabLol> Why
[2023-01-02 12:57:51] <%gitrickt> @snur_111 players who is a higher rank but either purposely deranked or made a new account to go against lower rank players
[2023-01-02 12:57:52] <lmArabLol> I thought it was cross play
[2023-01-02 12:57:54] <+PlayKellyPlay> smurf is an account that looks new or is low ranked but is played by someone over the skill rankl
[2023-01-02 12:57:58] <+playmakervf> its not too uncommon new players can be gold level of skill level right from the start i'd think a smurf would actually played better
[2023-01-02 12:58:09] <Azisco> Real bronze tank will like I need healing or overextended
[2023-01-02 12:58:09] <blastboys123> console is balanced differently
[2023-01-02 12:58:10] <+PlayKellyPlay> snur asked
[2023-01-02 12:58:12] <+ThePlaymaker13> idk how smurfs even get to bronze. If he was that good he should have been put higher after his initial placement matches.
[2023-01-02 12:58:20] <caffeinepls> @snur_111 are you asking what are smurfs? Smurfs are players that create another account, and consenquently they play with players at lower elo than he actually is
[2023-01-02 12:58:29] <+PlayKellyPlay> you're great
[2023-01-02 12:58:30] <%gitrickt> yeah someone asked what it means

[2023-01-02 13:22:06] <ButtonBuds> same in my gold games, ive got a dps main that is using bastion this season
[2023-01-02 13:22:08] <Azisco> Yeah lot of bastions
[2023-01-02 13:22:19] <lmArabLol> Sigma = best tank

[2023-01-02 13:22:36] <ButtonBuds> if you give him speed/nano he does really well if you can coordinate when he uses turret form
[2023-01-02 13:22:40] <overwatchenjoyer21> @cokoit I mean before this
[2023-01-02 13:22:42] <%atomchoco> @ButtonBuds its sad coz only few people know this
[2023-01-02 13:22:42] <blastboys123> bastion or reaper are just easy out of position destroyer characters it makes sense

[2023-01-02 13:23:00] <blastboys123> since well lower ranks tend to be out of position
[2023-01-02 13:23:04] <ButtonBuds> @mfpow1 huh, i tought he would drop off by that rank
[2023-01-02 13:23:06] <IsThatBrotherPopMan> niceeee awia
[2023-01-02 13:23:27] <overwatchenjoyer21> I thought rammatra only had like 3 skins
[2023-01-02 13:23:32] <+rattl4re> @PlayKellyPlay Yeah, that's what I thought, but it's kinda funny when currently there's like no consistency at all in between
[2023-01-02 13:23:49] <overwatchenjoyer21> @cokoit is the ram skin better than poseidon? if it is then I'll be mad
[2023-01-02 13:23:54] <ButtonBuds> ok, i was playing tank and i was playing monkey and my dps said it was my job to jump on the bastion and focus him
[2023-01-02 13:23:59] <ButtonBuds> that is dumb right?

[2023-01-02 13:25:33] <blastboys123> @ButtonBuds like with every decision there are factors that u have to consider like if bastion has support orif he has cds or if hes low but if we are talking bastion has all cds up and full health probably nott he best no

[2023-01-02 13:31:18] <RuraI_> I guess
[2023-01-02 13:31:43] <+PlayKellyPlay> plays like that have a huge impact in lower ranks
[2023-01-02 13:31:46] <+ThePlaymaker13> the hog is extra scram on this map but he hasn't tried to hook people off so shouldbe ok

[2023-01-02 13:35:38] <+PlayKellyPlay> @theDRanus accurate, but she isn't unplayable. she is balanced. easy to play instinmctively. It's about manageing the shield battery when you play her at higher ranks
[2023-01-02 13:35:39] <Luckysundayy> true
[2023-01-02 13:35:42] <RuraI_> I mean kiriko is still a good support pick
[2023-01-02 13:35:44] <cokoit> @Sickul sometimes I ult when I see I'm about to die cause if you ult you can get back into the mech immediately afterwards
[2023-01-02 13:35:44] <Azisco> She is one of the strongest healer

[2023-01-02 13:36:15] <cokoit> @Sickul not the best play but it's better than just have your mech get destroyed and have to wait a bunch and be vulnerable
[2023-01-02 13:36:17] <MishiMooo> dont leave us ;;
[2023-01-02 13:36:24] <ButtonBuds> maybe switch up the role?
[2023-01-02 13:36:25] <+ThePlaymaker13> she was just a heal bot though very little damage. Def gold or below. a higher level Kirko is also a very scary snipe threat.

[2023-01-02 15:52:32] <grumpyjabba> @SENDiaperr  a situation where a team loses a round simply because they do not stand on the objective or payload while the game is going in their favor. Not touching the objective or payload despite having won a teamfight is usually described as a C9

[2023-01-02 16:50:48] <%shootymcbirb> just realised that bastion is a good counter for rein
[2023-01-02 16:51:02] <%benk_nden> very good
[2023-01-02 16:51:03] <+ohjeezGames> yeah your rein charged way too far lol
[2023-01-02 16:51:06] <%Selkie> yeah your rein went IN for that
[2023-01-02 16:51:15] <%benk_nden> id say the counter of bastion is sigma
[2023-01-02 16:51:17] <%atomchoco> team became overconfident
[2023-01-02 16:51:32] <+ohjeezGames> coulda stopped this push like three times if he was with everyone
[2023-01-02 16:51:33] <%benk_nden> sigma counters alot
[2023-01-02 16:51:43] <resetreptiles> The best thing I learned is to die ASAP when the enemy team wins a fight. Your teammates will never wait for you. Once I learned that I got out quick.
[2023-01-02 16:51:45] <xHaunterz> I think your Rein has an ego problem lol, they keep trying to fight the other Rein
[2023-01-02 16:51:50] <m0mmygohi> genji counter bastion too

[2023-01-02 16:52:07] <rashifreyr> finally
[2023-01-02 16:52:24] <resetreptiles> It's so annoying. The tank usually over extends and then dies and then always just rushes back and dies 1v5 thinking he can come back in time.
[2023-01-02 16:52:31] <m0mmygohi> enemy def not playing counters
[2023-01-02 16:52:48] <ilu2_> playing as rein, you sign a contract to disregard all objectives if there's an enemy rein
[2023-01-02 16:52:58] <DezDay07> every last push
[2023-01-02 16:53:00] <%benk_nden> omg its almost 11 pm where im at

[2023-01-02 17:41:56] <dootdooto> @reivonito lshift is Fortify which stops her from being staggered by anything or charged on by a Rein. Also she takes less damage (i think)

[2023-01-02 17:49:32] <+DrThiccSnaqq> Men are just as emotional as women. The sad part men typically only know how to express anger and don't know how to express other emotions. Society has normalized anger in men.

[2023-01-02 18:29:38] <apple_juice_00> overwatch matchmaking intentionally allows bigger gaps in exchange for faster queue times

[2023-01-02 18:32:17] <+Alexmrcy> I believe that blizzard in lower rankings only place based on ranking or something like that
[2023-01-02 18:32:17] <larrybryan> If they are playing consistently well in their own performance and are matched with people who are underperforming, then their MMR won't be penalized by the loss

[2023-01-02 23:50:22] <charleyb166> @impeccablekarma keeping it on cart for overtime forces them away so yeeting it would‚Äôve given them opportunity to maybe hide on cart? other than that it‚Äôs gr8 to yeet it lol it‚Äôs so fun
