[2023-01-10 06:05:41] <%+mdkubit> Several years ago, my roommate and I were looking for a place to live. We found a really nice low-income neighborhood that looked perfect. As we were driving through the neighborhood, something felt wrong. Like, really wrong. I couldn't put my finger on it. All these kids came out to watch us, and everyone looked like they were completely dead inside.
[2023-01-10 06:05:44] <%TheHealthyDonut__> screw it, I'm getting a drink
[2023-01-10 06:05:58] <%+mdkubit> After we visited with the realtor, I mentioned this to my roommate, and he did a double-take. "Wait, you too? You felt that too? No fucking way, I thought it was just me!" The whole NEIGHBORHOOD felt like this, and neither of us could figure out why.

[2023-01-10 06:59:55] <%mdkubit> That is terrible. I've heard about that a lot from teachers, and how common it's becoming so that whatever salary you make, it gets cut by 1/3rd as you donate to make the learning fun.
[2023-01-10 06:59:56] <@%kdlutz> aww thats so awesome

[2023-01-10 07:24:05] <fireshadow105> phasmophobia sounds like it would be a good game for you then, you go into a haunted house and set up cameras, salt etc and try and figure out what kind of ghost, demon, etc that is haunting the house, you can use proximity chat and the ghost will occasionally talk back to you with the spirit box

[2023-01-10 07:30:38] <@%^Streamlabs> Tengu are a type of legendary creature found in Japanese folklore. They are a type of mischievous supernatural being. They are traditionally depicted with both human and avian (bird like) characteristics. Birdie is 50% human, 50% Tengu, and a 100% gremlin. Also those are horns on her head, not panda ears.
