[2023-01-05 06:34:30] <PrussianBot_> I feel like your energy/social level would make a Collab with a stranger very odd
[2023-01-05 06:34:32] <DDDeathmisttt> Based
[2023-01-05 06:34:33] <%+dragonrealms24> most collabs I've watched the streamers have been like friends for months
[2023-01-05 06:34:33] <%Helblinde> It can be pretty fun if you are drunk enough jumping into new groups though clauviOgey
[2023-01-05 06:34:35] <%Ruisuyan> optimal collabs are like relationships, you have to know well each other first
[2023-01-05 06:34:44] <%Paint2D> between friends it's great yeah

[2023-01-05 06:34:52] <%AstroSango> collabs can be the start of building chemistry in the long term, so it's understandable
[2023-01-05 06:35:06] <Cozy_Nero> two is ideal imo
[2023-01-05 06:35:11] <%BearEatSalmon> clauvio play might and magic 4: clouds of xeen with me

[2023-01-05 06:35:46] <baxtercrook> clauvi please collab with me. i have two viewers (three if my mom is off work)
[2023-01-05 06:35:47] <Temporal_Paradox> extroverts are weird
[2023-01-05 06:35:47] <%Rezuul> there's a divide for the people that only like solo streams because they want to "hang out" with the streamer, and when there's a collab it feels like the streamer's hanging out with another streamer instead of chat so they get big-mad

[2023-01-05 10:03:29] <achievementguy> the forces would be too much for the human body
[2023-01-05 10:03:31] <%+razorthecurse> I think it would tear your arm off
[2023-01-05 10:03:41] <JensenRabbit> ninja rope was a thing, but not grappling gun kind
[2023-01-05 10:03:45] <%Girutea> smart
[2023-01-05 10:03:45] <socialistOtter> there ARE hooks attached to ropes, though
[2023-01-05 10:03:49] <socialistOtter> like, grapnels
[2023-01-05 10:03:52] <%BlueBlazeGX> I mean grappling hooks exist. As long as the hookshot doesnt shoot you THAT fast, theoretically it could happen
[2023-01-05 10:03:53] <Falling7moons> i mean a gun that shoots a grappling hook is probably a thing
[2023-01-05 10:03:56] <%CyOrion> At least the rope thing from Wind Waker is real. 🙃
[2023-01-05 10:04:00] <ErraticPillow> matpat did a video on the hookshot before he went weird
[2023-01-05 10:04:20] <%+razorthecurse> it would be sick doe

[2023-01-05 10:31:32] <socialistOtter> the chuck norris meme was actually a boomer meme. as in, boomers invented it
[2023-01-05 10:31:47] <socialistOtter> that doesn't mean it didn't exist for other generations
[2023-01-05 10:31:52] <jimmy_mapp> imagine lying about being a zoomer for clout
