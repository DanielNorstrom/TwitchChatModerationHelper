[2023-01-02 14:02:51] <%+Hannibal_78> @komemos exactly, when someone cannot stay still  can watch the vod. You was always helpful whe  you knew around when you did something during your stream, told to as and that way it was more easy to find in the vod what we was looking. That experiance  in the past made me ask the question. No disrespect.
