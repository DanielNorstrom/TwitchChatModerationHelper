[2022-12-15 20:23:03] <+77amazin> They lead with it cause making a great game comes second to making the most money possible
[2022-12-15 20:23:09] <+kchnr> D4 Battle Pass: The Battle Pass awards free Season Boosts. Boosts accelerate players’ progress for the duration of the Season. For example, a Season Boost might accelerate XP earned to make leveling multiple characters within a season faster. Because they affect gameplay, Season Boosts are free rewards for all players. We want to be clear that players can’t unlock Season Boosts more quickly through purchases--there is no way to unlock more boosts, or boosts at a faster pace, by spending money.

[2022-12-15 21:09:11] <BlueBanana3> i think they also have a lot of constraints in their design because its the 4th part of a series that has to relate to the other parts. they could probably do much better if they'd start a new world design

[2022-12-15 21:16:10] <+OfficialKempo> Overwatch 2 claims it's not pay to win because its new heroes are on the free battle pass, but at like level 50 and level 1 for paid battle pass - takes many hours to get there... I imagine they'll use a similar model for D4
[2022-12-15 21:16:16] <Dr4gondemon> @nugiyen Imo if you have a game with p2w it shouldnt be allowed legally to be called a game anymore. Imagine playing monopoly but everyone starts with more or less money depending on their irl job. Then its not a "game" anymore. Everyone should be even thats the whole point of a game

[2022-12-15 21:16:42] <+blargin> Depends what you want from a game.  What am I winning?
[2022-12-15 21:16:47] <!%warfirev> Overwatch leaves such a sour taste in my mouth, and this is quickly approaching
[2022-12-15 21:16:52] <%OrsoWobble> pugPls
[2022-12-15 21:17:12] <Abcss> @nugiyen i mean an ARPG is mostly a solo game and not a pvp game, so what if some people just wanna pay and enjoy it
[2022-12-15 21:18:17] <Dr4gondemon> @nugiyen HOW can you be ok with that. It makes it so the devs are encouraged to creater tedium ingame. Its bad
[2022-12-15 21:18:29] <MBlicher> agreed
[2022-12-15 21:18:33] <rhaunie> Them not perma banning people who buy from botters was the mistake that killed the economy.

[2022-12-15 21:18:57] <Eibonz> regulations is required definitely
[2022-12-15 21:19:24] <+Schlaug> Greedy devs create problems and sell solutions
[2022-12-15 21:19:38] <Abcss> @nugiyen think of it as old GTA games where you had the option of punching in the cheat codes but most people chose not to
[2022-12-15 21:19:45] <%OrsoWobble> The main thing I have a problem with is games making you buy in game currency to buy things, that entire system is designed to eek out money from people
[2022-12-15 21:19:51] <+Schlaug> makes the experience worse if you're not paying the mons
[2022-12-15 21:20:29] <Abcss> money = less time spent grinding, so if you have less time you end up paying
[2022-12-15 21:20:40] VIEWERS: 976
[2022-12-15 21:20:53] <Jobcontroller> Game should be priority always. Then things you can buy eventually, not the other way around.
[2022-12-15 21:20:54] <HardstyleMike321> cosmetics and quality of life stiff can be fine, but in a competitive (pvp of any kind whatsoever) you should never be able to buy an advantage
[2022-12-15 21:21:17] <ZelViuS> U cant expect Blizz to balance the game around not paying a penny
[2022-12-15 21:21:59] <Abcss> @nugiyen but ahead of what? its a solo game for the most part, there is no competitive aspect to it, ARPG's that is
[2022-12-15 21:22:02] <+OfficialKempo> I can see them making certain character classes "unlockable" on the battle pass but freely available from start for paying players
[2022-12-15 21:22:02] <+Schlaug> sure, if it's not a full-priced game already
[2022-12-15 21:22:08] <vizmint> content shouldn't work like that in an arpg though
[2022-12-15 21:22:14] <%OrsoWobble> translated into poe, something like skipping leveling after a month into a league?
[2022-12-15 21:22:35] <Dr4gondemon> @nugiyen you shouldnt want to skip! thats a problem

[2022-12-15 21:25:52] <vizmint> D3 as a game was the wild west when RMAH was a thing
[2022-12-15 21:25:57] <%OrsoWobble> nugiJam
[2022-12-15 21:26:25] <ryuukk__> players do what they want outside of the game, but the game should NOT be designed around "using real money", it defeats the integrity of the game at its core
[2022-12-15 21:26:25] <%Skik7> the RMAH wasn't a bad thing, what was bad was the internal systems that forced drops not for your char so you was more forced to use the AH more.
[2022-12-15 21:26:25] <%$Kerpolini> d3 RMAH made it so you sent more time on the AH then in game coz it was more effictive to do so Oo it was shit

[2022-12-15 21:26:49] <Abcss> @nugiyen i mean for some people they make more money/h working, and they still want to enjoy the game for the few hours they play
[2022-12-15 21:27:21] <Dr4gondemon> such a stupid argument
[2022-12-15 21:27:35] <Dr4gondemon> youre a problem whale
[2022-12-15 21:27:39] <Dr4gondemon> :D
[2022-12-15 21:28:08] <+saltpastillen> The original problem, for a pleb like me, was the droprate. I could find gear on the AH that was a 100x stronger than anything I could farm myself.
[2022-12-15 21:28:18] <ZelViuS> Whale lifes matter KEKW
[2022-12-15 21:28:19] <%mrmoopie> i could play 3 months of world of warcraft with my gaming hours, or spend half a day of work (for the cash) to buy a boost
[2022-12-15 21:28:23] <Dr4gondemon> yeah sure. i guess the "no harm to other players" is debatable
