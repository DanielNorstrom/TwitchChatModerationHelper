[2023-01-06 13:00:00] <professor_waker> PRAHA !
[2023-01-06 13:00:22] <ReijoRitari> @tensay86 I don't think doubling your reload time for extra 140avg is good, especially when you lose 15mm of avg pen too on normal shells. And that's 30mm on gold difference too. Also you are more inaccurate with that 122mm. So yeah, overmatching isn't the thing that people think, its the higher per shot dmg I bet
[2023-01-06 13:00:22] <lagamer18> @skill4ltu gsor its like one trip ponny, with ap shells its ok, with gold its amazing

[2023-01-06 14:09:41] <EXO6> @Toranaga321 it's not crazy, it's caused by Lanchesters Square Law. it happens in IRL war too
[2023-01-06 14:09:41] <!%$Bishox> full gold challange is just normal game fellas
[2023-01-06 14:09:48] <+vicamosa> it seems difficult to get consistent results with this tank, due to the reload time and the duration of the games

[2023-01-06 14:10:40] <%teclado92> @skill4ltu just think about playing caernarn X and AMBT only HE just think about it
[2023-01-06 14:11:04] <@%momix99> free 2 play is mainly annoying in the start. the longer you play the less you are forced to pay. imo.
[2023-01-06 14:11:06] <%+agfox> pain is content

[2023-01-06 14:15:21] <%Kedare9999> @aLLaN198602 I find 60TP one of the best heavies in game. Play for close range, and wiggle. This tank is very hard to penetrate when you are not exposing lower plate.

[2023-01-06 15:56:41] <@%ItzAndreyZhak> @NoobitoRU You're correct, they "implemented" a rammer to it, after the nerf of the italian medium line.
[2023-01-06 15:56:52] <%LeanBlanket> @NoobitoRU many tanks got buffed, but I think that only Skorp G was nerfed. And they gave player opportunity to give them their money back

[2023-01-06 15:59:04] <%LeanBlanket> @THE___Diablo When it came out, yes, if I remember correctly. I remember that they offered many players refund. That's why they cannot nerf premium tanks. Because if they would want to nerf the tank, they would have to offer players refund

[2023-01-06 17:02:37] <+rero_design> In a few weeks, the BZ is outdated and no one is playing it anymore. Its always like that when a new Premiumtank comes into the game.

[2023-01-06 17:02:58] <%Mckrixx> @skill4ltu its like blaming ferrari for making a very expensive car that is very fast also. it will also overtake you but its your decision do you want to drive a lada or not
[2023-01-06 17:02:59] <Sageofsixpaths_460> Remember when Patriot was super competitive?
[2023-01-06 17:03:02] <+DoktorRasse> @rero_design can't even wait for more op tank
[2023-01-06 17:03:02] <Ap3L1nc0ln> @skill4ltu  how come games like Dota or League can balance their game properly and still make profits then?
[2023-01-06 17:03:04] <vulkan_69> @rero_design no it's not, has the skoda ever been outdated ? renegade ? no, same goes for bz as it's on the same level of power
[2023-01-06 17:03:04] <%+hellglorypl> I agree, but disagree, look a skoda it nice tank but has weakeness, BZ needs a nerf
[2023-01-06 17:03:09] <%furballexpress> @imbo_21 eh, maybe...but as skill said, you have to make a profit at some point
[2023-01-06 17:03:15] <%+maccoy_nl> is there a way to see my average earnings per tank?
[2023-01-06 17:03:25] <imbo_21> @furballexpress business is business

[2023-01-06 17:03:36] <%albatross_bravo> but osrs is not about money because bonds can be bought with in game money
[2023-01-06 17:03:41] <%furballexpress> @hellglorypl best BZ nerf = make rockets explodable and weak

[2023-01-06 17:03:43] <%+danhelsing74> i would rather play with defender

[2023-01-06 18:37:14] <@%Basleader92> @isko_g01 maybe one day, but that would match with the current tanks so they would have to make tier 11/12 tanks and probably seperate MM for those as well so I doubt we'll see it any time soon
[2023-01-06 18:37:17] <vontzifren> Iron Arny and Bz's is untouchable kind of teeeeenks....

[2023-01-06 22:24:45] <%+roshambeautanker> This just shows that most matches just need someone to make a succesful push like that to break an enemy line. But too many players are so concerned about their own tank that they just don't want to try

[2023-01-06 22:54:45] <+Ferey69> I guess thats the perk of cigarettes/vaping, its not influencing the mental process. Unlike drugs and such.
