Sheefs mods have asked members of the Tarkov community to share her GoFundMe link to help raise money to get her back on her feet. Even if you can't donate, sharing the link is greatly appreciated: https://www.gofundme.com/f/grnf5-replace-my-moms-home-and-belongings

[2022-12-09 14:10:48] <%aramsham> I want titanium teeth like Jaws from Moonraker... Course not really feasible.
[2022-12-09 14:10:50] <@%+jimmiedrum> I was missing them genetically
[2022-12-09 14:10:52] <glassqt> Imagine having teeth on your chest
[2022-12-09 14:10:59] <%ToastRackTV> Peroxide yeah
[2022-12-09 14:11:16] <%prepare2carry> i have 14 fake teeth i lost my originals in a car accident

[2022-12-09 14:11:59] <%prepare2carry> @jimmiedrum mine as well all 14
[2022-12-09 14:12:01] <%aramsham> Oh shit, so it is maybe feasible... no chick would prob date me after though.. @jimmiedrum
[2022-12-09 14:12:08] <+patriotdadgamer> Yea meds suck when the side effects are the most off the wall crap! Have had my fair share of odd side effects.
[2022-12-09 14:12:10] <@%+jimmiedrum> in before thicc shows up to say he doesn't brush his teeth
[2022-12-09 14:12:17] <%ToastRackTV> Flouride is fine
[2022-12-09 14:12:22] <@%I_Am_Geese> I dunno either, I ain't a teeth mans
[2022-12-09 14:12:24] <glassqt> maybe once and a while charcoal can be okay but as a toothpaste fuck nah
[2022-12-09 14:12:37] <%aramsham> Like, unreal white?
[2022-12-09 14:12:39] <@%+jimmiedrum> eh, @aramsham , you can't see them
[2022-12-09 14:12:45] <BoltSauce> Charcoal is not good for your teeth. It just erodes the top layer of your teeth to reveal the whiter lower layers. Hydrogen Peroxide percentage above 3% is very damaging to your teeth too. Rock those yellow teeth my kings and queens
[2022-12-09 14:12:48] <+god_takeda> @Gingy how are you getting them white again then?
[2022-12-09 14:12:54] <glassqt> use baking soda and peroxide
[2022-12-09 14:12:55] <@%+jimmiedrum> like in friends where they turn on the black light....
[2022-12-09 14:12:58] <%aramsham> Yeah, but if they can do that, why not a whole titanium tooth @jimmiedrum
[2022-12-09 14:12:58] <+PapaMurph27> Don‚Äôt like fluoride?
[2022-12-09 14:13:13] <@%+jimmiedrum> money, that's am expensive metal....

[2022-12-09 14:14:05] <BoltSauce> guys...dont make your own teeth treatment ointments. Instant whiteners just erode the top layer of your teeth
[2022-12-09 14:14:07] <%aramsham> Yeah, gotta love when meds you need to function have just "wonderful" side effects
[2022-12-09 14:14:10] <BoltSauce> just brush and rock those yellow dentals

[2022-12-09 14:16:19] <%aramsham> jesus, yeah 3200 is nuts, 500 makes sense to me for a shooter like this
[2022-12-09 14:16:31] <bigdad_tv> @I_Am_Geese i wont
[2022-12-09 14:16:38] <glassqt> around 700 or 800 for me.
[2022-12-09 14:16:48] <Demnzo> if you like tarkov you should give "Marauders" a try
[2022-12-09 14:17:05] <+dfreddy_> maybe thats why i have shit aim tho xD. but i dont like having to move my arm halway across my desk
[2022-12-09 14:17:06] <iAdrenalineTV> Is the flea still the same as it was at the start of wipe?
[2022-12-09 14:17:08] <Atomic_2k> you using glasses with strenght @Gingy
[2022-12-09 14:17:09] <@%+jimmiedrum> can I just spank you @i_am_geese ?
[2022-12-09 14:17:09] <glassqt> No nesting today?
[2022-12-09 14:17:17] <%aramsham> Marauders is neat, but very bare bones compared to Tarky

[2022-12-09 14:32:37] <Hotdogisasandwich> damn he peek
[2022-12-09 14:32:40] <Hotdogisasandwich> lol
[2022-12-09 14:32:41] <AliYourDaddy> @aramsham make sure binaural audio is on you might not be able to understand the direction of a sound if its off
[2022-12-09 14:32:50] <%MAcroS_> imagine the smell in lab rn
[2022-12-09 14:32:51] <allbeeeee> @aramsham audio isnt everything, if u're at higher floors u cant hear stuffs below u
[2022-12-09 14:32:52] <%aramsham> They want that fat loot
[2022-12-09 14:33:12] <+MicroBM96> games with good binaural make me so happy
[2022-12-09 14:33:17] <HexxisNox> could you elaborate on the binaural?
[2022-12-09 14:33:17] <+BIaz> are they replacing it with something else?

[2022-12-09 14:35:02] <+MicroBM96> Devs are having an issue with binaural causing audio propagation problems, so they're working on an alternative method. Haven't given a ton of details on the one they're updating to, but the steam library they use for it doesn't mesh well with their game

[2022-12-09 14:48:38] <+MicroBM96> it's easy to make 300-500k from a very basic scav run
[2022-12-09 14:48:40] <Keudn> person probably thinks scavs are dumb bc they have -6 scav rep

[2022-12-09 14:48:59] <+SquatingLikeASlav> scaving is a waste of time if you need a kit you can go in as a save on factory and then just leave the raid immediately and that is the only time I play scav
[2022-12-09 14:49:01] <Universalsoul> I scav main factory a lot, and often have 200k + raids. I know other maps are better, but Factory can just be in and out
[2022-12-09 14:49:07] <@%I_Am_Geese> @jimmiedrum that's the direction I was going with it lmao

[2022-12-09 15:58:52] <RenogadeRalph213017> have y"all seen wills movement you don't get that just from a wipe or 4
[2022-12-09 15:58:54] <%CallMeSleeepy> like when alpha switched into beta
[2022-12-09 15:59:08] <%+BlightyMan83> The devs were the actors?
[2022-12-09 15:59:14] <%JDiamatti> Well Will like worked for BSG for a while. I believe in the marketing area
[2022-12-09 15:59:14] <%+BlightyMan83> Maybe it's him :O

[2022-12-09 15:59:19] <coronattvx> whats his twitter?
[2022-12-09 15:59:20] <%JDiamatti> maybe not marketing.
[2022-12-09 15:59:26] <%+cz4peq> Klean was PR man
[2022-12-09 15:59:26] <palms____> he was community guy i think
[2022-12-09 15:59:28] <%+Simply_Distracted> i think Will said he was marketing
[2022-12-09 15:59:29] <coronattvx> the dev twitter
[2022-12-09 15:59:30] <+TireGod17> if you look at past wipe dates there has only been 12 wipes since beta
[2022-12-09 15:59:31] <+blackandgold61> Wast Klean community marketing ?
[2022-12-09 15:59:32] <+gironimo01> Klean was community manager
[2022-12-09 15:59:36] <%+thejock16> does this mean arena will be open to testing then , hmmmmm
