[2022-12-23 09:52:25] <%+duke1102> @Ultimhate Yea, I was in a state of pissed off and anxiety yesterday. Luckily it seems to be the case that the neighbor over me just seemed to spilled a bunch of water that somehow found its way down into my ceiling, I think a broken water pipe would have fucked things up way more and would needed me to face the shame of slob apartment and call landlord right away.

[2022-12-23 10:21:01] <%+duke1102> @BarbleBapkins Yea dunno about Toyota. Hyundai is a South Korean company though and their cars come with 5 years warranty, that's nice. Gotta do those yearly checkups tho for it to stay valid, but I have a "service flatrate" with my car dealer/mechanic where I pay 29‚Ç¨/monthly and don't have to pay anything when I bring in the car, that's pretty nice considering those checkups cost like 300‚Ç¨+. (And also who knows what other things might arise where I need to bring it to the mechanic)

[2022-12-23 10:26:29] <%+duke1102> @BarbleBapkins I mean, if I remember correctly, that "flatrate" is nothing more than like a credit you put in with the car dealer's house bank and they just use those funds for payment. So if you spend more money than you put in as credit and you decide to cancel the "flatrate" you still have to pay the remaining cost anyways. But still, it's a nice thing to have.

And then there's also companies like BMW or Mercedes who look things already built into the car behind a subscription paywall, in BMW's case the seat heating or Mercedes is planning to offer a subscription to unlock more power for some cars, that's such bullshit imho, just pure cash grab scam.

[2022-12-23 10:56:18] <+ChomikowyPedziwiatr> with vampirism is it better to drink blood for the flask, spill it and then drink or it's the same?

[2022-12-23 11:31:35] <%merppr> yes, then you need to make storage units that use few bars of iron and chest @v1k1ng2003 then you place them all beside each other, blue holds stations, teal holds ingredients and the storage units are where everything is actually stored

[2022-12-23 11:50:01] <%Thaelina> So I was playin Noita earlier and was getting a god run going. I was in a pw looking for chainsaws in the fungal caverns. Ended up getting polyd into a sheep. I landed somehwer i thought was safe and then I just straight up died. Turns out i drowned standing behind some fungus and had no idea til i died.

[2022-12-23 13:18:42] <grinreaper2711> @majesticslothofdoom245 getting lifetime back to negative one would be the problem there.
[2022-12-23 13:18:46] <%kuuucki> I was so happy when fungus shifted... so I knew I cam watch you for longer :)

[2022-12-23 13:23:07] <%majesticslothofdoom245> @chelodau there is a wand setup on the wiki that breaks the damage display and can easily be improved, but the wiki doesnt have any notes for damage overflow, so probably not.
[2022-12-23 13:23:11] <%axolotine> some really good stuff in there :)

[2022-12-23 13:36:02] <%+teh60> @UnknownForce heavy shot + 3 more from copy thrice = +200 recoil, same as recoil modifier and i think 1 framing thats enough

[2022-12-23 13:53:17] <Oscarabeetle> you know reduce timer and short tele bolt makes a perfect spam tele wand
[2022-12-23 13:53:24] <wintercrusader> is there a way to use cast 3 random spells on the shield spell?!
[2022-12-23 13:53:38] <%+redtens> and copying the spell doesn't copy its delays i guess

[2022-12-23 14:14:36] <%MoroseMonkey> Honestly, I'm happy to count the fact that you didn't dunk yourself into acid as  a win SeemsGood
[2022-12-23 14:14:43] <%Ultimhate> I don't understand the hype about Dark and Darker, it's just a battle royale in a dungeon

[2022-12-23 14:14:52] <fanboiERA> @DunkOrSlam you should make a run where you fight the bosses without cheesing :) And bosses that have immunity you HAVE to fight them when you find a spell that could hurt them.

[2022-12-23 14:15:35] <%+teh60> @fanboiERA he has done an all boss no cheese run where he needed to get kill on the progress menu for all bosses, it went uhhh interestingly to say the least (it waas a win with many dnkThrow
[2022-12-23 14:15:50] <suneidolia> @ultimhate nothin to be confused about... I mean ppl love competitive games and a huge chunk of ppl playing it also enjoy the hardcore pvp side of it

[2022-12-23 14:16:14] <suneidolia> like i bet a lot of the ppl playing DaD enjoy old school runescape wildy pvp too lol

[2022-12-23 14:17:15] <%Nauk> yeah its a loot & extract game not a BR, you can ''win'' without fighting

[2022-12-23 14:17:54] <%breaketh1> its for sure not a BR, 10-15 ppl in a map has been around way longer than BR. BR was the 100 people lobbys free for alls.
