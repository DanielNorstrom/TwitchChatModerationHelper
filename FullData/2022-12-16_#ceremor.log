[2022-12-16 03:23:04] <+thebuffalo22> Damn
[2022-12-16 03:23:06] <ImpLoaf> COD does have sound occlusion because gunshots sound different whether you’re inside or outside
[2022-12-16 03:23:11] <%Mythic_Lunchbox> still half a win
[2022-12-16 03:23:13] <cram_staar> lolol
[2022-12-16 03:23:16] <+thebuffalo22> Cod is ass

[2022-12-16 03:23:51] <ImpLoaf> It’s blatant pro military propaganda but it’s top notch fps
[2022-12-16 03:23:51] <Mikey904> COD shouldve stayed on console LUL
[2022-12-16 03:23:57] <+thebuffalo22> Trash game that is released at 60%

[2022-12-16 03:24:10] <+ryanthewise_> you can kick already just not while standing
[2022-12-16 03:24:18] <%+secondgenlife> @Mikey904 the only reason cod is relevant is because of console players
[2022-12-16 03:24:19] <Mikey904> Irrelevant LUL

[2022-12-16 04:51:32] <@%SetPhaserstoPun> yeah inertia doesnt impact the parkour stuff at all, that was all the new dayz fix for "hitting a wall and getting stuck while falling"
[2022-12-16 04:51:41] <@%SetPhaserstoPun> servers can turn off inertia basically
[2022-12-16 04:51:46] <@%SetPhaserstoPun> and it will still happen
[2022-12-16 04:52:03] <leever460> @jeisurii Are you trying to excuse the excessive tax theft by the US Govt? You a IRS scum?

[2022-12-16 04:52:10] <%fr0zenfear> I don’t think inertia has made any jumps easier or now possible
[2022-12-16 04:52:15] <Silentoverwatch1> no thr inertia running has affected park our jumping and character stacking

[2022-12-16 05:19:23] <+funlo_> @setphaserstopun you can get them early, theres alot of ammo for them, and they are great in all situations besides maybe really long range but then you can just use a sniper but then snipers dont one shot far away like they used to
