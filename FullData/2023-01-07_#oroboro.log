[2023-01-07 03:38:35] <lexus690> @oroboro If possible you better never skip weapons that give bonuses. Darkness is never enough in this game. :D
[2023-01-07 03:38:37] <LoonyNo7> Heightened security is for a challenge that gives a ton of blood
[2023-01-07 03:38:42] <LoonyNo7> Middle management is also a fun one
[2023-01-07 03:38:46] <+CookiezPls> The Harder Boss variants add a lot of heat, but arent THAT bad

[2023-01-07 03:39:05] <!%Ebonslayer> @EldritchPreacher For all except Spear the weapon has to have 5 titan blood invested into it. Afterwards a character will have a new dialogue in their queue that gives the passcode to unlock the aspect.

[2023-01-07 04:42:33] <chiyo721> @TheValiantBob Make sure to go for darkness so you keep leveling your mirror. Give  nectar to different npcs and get their keepsakes and level them up.  If you're specifically having trouble with Temple of Styx then Broken Spearpoint from Patroclus in Elysium (depressed dude that can refill death's defiances) can be really good especially vs the poison

[2023-01-07 05:34:34] <%SteveSketches> Eris or Zag for Demeter on Attack tho
[2023-01-07 05:34:34] <%Eragel> eris is better but hestia is more fun imo

[2023-01-07 07:40:11] <%nola_epeeist> @kjr59 Rupture not as good as jolted, but it adds damage. This late into the run, I doubt the extra chance of epic is going to do that much damage

[2023-01-07 07:41:25] <%SteveSketches> Yup, there's flat damage and percentage.  Flat damage is best on the speedy attack, percentage is better on the slower ones.  Shotty means you want a percentage damage boon on attack.
[2023-01-07 07:41:26] <%nola_epeeist> need arty for shotgun to make sense. But arty bad for gun if you don't get shotgun. So it never feels right unless you get it super early
