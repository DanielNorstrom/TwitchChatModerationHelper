[2022-12-21 16:07:55] <!don_azucar> i love Oust a lot, wish it were more playable
[2022-12-21 16:08:01] <+mattmanw2> Technically you could play path to exile
[2022-12-21 16:08:10] <Dressedspring1> I played this deck with on thin ice instead of lay down arms and felt it was pretty good. Adds devotion for heliod, removes murktides or evoke elementals on turn 2 or 3, it was pretty reasonable. Lightning bolt being instant is great though obviously

[2022-12-21 16:10:09] <mks5000mtg> blue ragavan would just draw a card
[2022-12-21 16:10:12] <%+PlaneshiftWill> Red is way better than blue

[2022-12-21 16:10:20] <@%FourDogsInAHorseSuit> black ragavan, but it mills and you can cast the top card of the gy until EOT
[2022-12-21 16:10:21] <+mattmanw2> But would it be pre-banned like grief?
[2022-12-21 16:10:25] <thetmeat8> blue would have flying instead of dash

[2022-12-21 16:11:39] <Tectek> ragavan would not be a break in blue. both treasure generation and stealijg stuff from opponent is blue. the rate of 1 mana 2/1 is strange in blue though

[2022-12-21 16:16:05] <LilSkittls> "Until the start of your next turn, Urza's saga gains {make a token}"
[2022-12-21 16:16:12] <JoLLy44> or it should be allowed to make 2 tokens, but you can only make them in your turn
[2022-12-21 16:16:20] <%+KmDraven> When urza’s saga was spoiled I had never played with a saga before so I thought you just kept it in the field and could keep making tokens for the rest of the game lol
[2022-12-21 16:16:29] <Adamcapps08> Make it "Until your next opponents endstep, ~ gains "xx" "
[2022-12-21 16:16:33] <jiluand> like why does sozekan cost 3 and takenuma cost 4 anyway, but then boseiju being less is crazy
[2022-12-21 16:16:33] <thetmeat8> ya flipping makes dumb combo more dumb
[2022-12-21 16:16:38] <maniospas> also the current last chapter is acceleration (for a turn) with drum in your deck
[2022-12-21 16:16:38] <%riff__raff__> saga's fetch ability is such a cool build around though
[2022-12-21 16:16:42] <%adamant0> Just get rid of the weird rule exception that saga's don't sacrifice until the chapter 3 ability is off the stack
[2022-12-21 16:16:52] <Poco_the_turtle> imagine read ahead on saga
[2022-12-21 16:16:54] <+mattmanw2> @kmdraven You do with thespian’s stage.
[2022-12-21 16:17:05] <%Aper_MtG> All sagas should have read ahead
[2022-12-21 16:17:12] <Matte8pt> and ragavan should make a blood token, why change cards guys i dont get it
[2022-12-21 16:17:12] <kingdubg> so what do you think about heartless summoning in a archon build?
[2022-12-21 16:17:22] <%+KmDraven> @mattmanw2 that’s awesome
[2022-12-21 16:17:22] <+BasiliaSpice> Urza's saga is probably fine as-is tbh because you unramp yourself. i think Urza's cost of sacing a land is higher than is usually recognized.
[2022-12-21 16:17:30] <%Aper_MtG> titan would be nuts though
[2022-12-21 16:17:41] <jiluand> drc still surveiling after becoming a 3/3 flyer feels a little strange

[2022-12-21 16:17:48] <%Aper_MtG> But prime time costing 4 is hot
[2022-12-21 16:17:51] <+Noble_Rooster> @Aper_MtG imagine urza's saga with read ahead just being whir of invention x=0 or 1 for free

Then they don't have metalcraft. Then if you  a fetch/grange you could put Ballista up to 3 (1 from grange, 1 from 4 mana), kill the Paladin and then maybe stabalize?

[2022-12-21 16:35:09] <@%^MTGBot> Dear MTGO User AspiringSpike: I noticed your decklist does not contain the Magic: the Gathering card Patch Up. To me, this is a grievous oversight that must be immediately rectified. Please add this card to your deck forthwith or I will be left with no recourse but to unfollow. Again, the card I am suggesting you add is Patch Up. Thank You.

[2022-12-21 16:55:34] <@%+TurtlePowerMTG> Now just need to ban it in Pioneer.
[2022-12-21 16:55:42] <Slim_Wenzy> I want my $90 4/5s Dangit
[2022-12-21 16:55:46] <BoltSnapBolt_MTG> the failure to ban wrenn was such a bad punt tho

[2022-12-21 16:55:57] <+Noble_Rooster> when i first started magic in high school all I knew about modern was that it was FULL of COMBO DECKS that could win on TURN 4 and that was scary as a broke standard player
[2022-12-21 16:55:58] <%HugHeist> know what's better than a 2/2 Sentinel? a 3/3 Sentinel
[2022-12-21 16:56:01] <%Nuclerchckn> Twin with t3f would be too op
[2022-12-21 16:56:05] <%adamant0> The only thing I don't like about modern rn is that you can cascade into cards with no casting cost.
[2022-12-21 16:56:20] <@%+TurtlePowerMTG> Gosh, I really wonder if we are gets new Swords going back to Phyrexia.
[2022-12-21 16:56:28] <%makoobi> havent been keeping up with modern, but are there any good control decks viable right now?
[2022-12-21 16:56:28] <20_eyess> Period.
[2022-12-21 16:56:35] <%dadconfidand> is wren even a ban worthy card?

[2022-12-21 16:56:48] <%dadconfidand> I think wren is strong but like that's it

[2022-12-21 16:57:05] <%adamant0> When they changed cascade for bird brain they should have specified that the card you cascade into has a casting cost, not just be lower value than the cascade spell
[2022-12-21 16:57:06] <sexy_andy> modern is like life actually, not everybody can't be satisfied at the same time, you'll always go through up and downs
[2022-12-21 16:57:10] <Slim_Wenzy> My opinion is that there always will be a group of best decks, where something about that deck feels too good in comparison. But in terms of relative power, it is fine.
[2022-12-21 16:57:21] <+toginablender711> people have a misconception that if they just would ban the card that they think is too good, the format would just magically become some utopia format where everything is perfect

[2022-12-21 16:57:56] <%dadconfidand> Lurrus was a little too much
[2022-12-21 16:57:58] <+ecstasy_in_service> haven't we learned that companion was just a bad idea ?
[2022-12-21 16:57:59] <@%+TurtlePowerMTG> Remember when people said that GDS was still going to be Tier 1 with a Lurrus Ban?
[2022-12-21 16:58:03] <%+lolbrolol> Lurrus in the running for most broken care of all time outside of power 9
[2022-12-21 16:58:11] <%+Bambino430> I feel like hammer can already be really grindy, it was miserable with Lurrus...
[2022-12-21 16:58:14] <@%Squee_GoblinNabob> yeah but no burn player is going to sacrifice their 15th sideboard card for lurrus
[2022-12-21 16:58:14] <zebugbug> wait... you would play lures in burn???
[2022-12-21 16:58:15] <%Nuclerchckn> You think pod unban would break the format? #defnotmypetdeck

[2022-12-21 16:58:17] <%+admiralarick> we all know burn players weren't gonna play lurrus over 15th sb slot
[2022-12-21 16:58:19] <%Bonsheen> Hardened scales with lurrus was amazing

[2022-12-21 16:58:20] <%dadconfidand> @lolbrolol aaaand oko
[2022-12-21 16:58:26] <+Quixoticcommand> On the scale of bean freeness, lurrus was too free
[2022-12-21 16:58:29] <jeffisepic> compaion as a whole should be unprinted, even though i know they wont. 10 cards is like, same number as ante
[2022-12-21 16:58:31] <+dwaynebank> Bauble is just too strong of an engine for these delirium decks at basically no cost.
[2022-12-21 16:58:40] <+rueler18> Lurrus pre companion tax may have been top 3 most broken cards ever printed
[2022-12-21 16:58:41] <%joymonger> What got dropped for the bolts in the deck?
[2022-12-21 16:58:43] <%+lolbrolol> True Oko is right beside Lurrus
[2022-12-21 16:58:46] <zaccadeathandtaxes> @aspiringspike what is your opinion if modern right now? do you think is well balanced? would you change something?
[2022-12-21 16:58:47] <%dadconfidand> Lurrus was free in life total control

[2022-12-21 16:59:03] <Slim_Wenzy> Lurus needed to be worded like Keruga. The fact that you could play 3 mana instants always felt wrong
[2022-12-21 16:59:08] <%adamant0> I'm pretty sick of bauble doing basically everything tbh
[2022-12-21 16:59:29] <lagdotcom> 0 mana artifacts should do nothing like darksteel thingy
[2022-12-21 16:59:30] <+Noble_Rooster> I remember when bauble was just a lantern control card lol

[2022-12-21 17:00:29] <%todesfirma> do you still think manamorphose is right in prowess ? or are you interested in LUTS

[2022-12-21 17:05:12] <%todesfirma> ok i agree just wanted your thought. i have been considering dropping to 2 breach and dropping 1 iconoclast for 2 dragons. i think with iteration and channler youre likely to find the breach and more than 1 in hand feels bad. ive found myself in alot of hard spots where dragon wins me the game but iconoclast doesnt.

[2022-12-21 17:32:08] <$argentorum> Black lotus and Darksteel relic are just very different cards except for CMC and card type, as well, right @aspiringspike Kappa
[2022-12-21 17:32:13] <%$theblazingbogle917> in the context of modern Jace isn't close to Karn
[2022-12-21 17:32:19] <@%+hmmyespanda> idk, JTMS is better in pioneer than Karn if it were printed. it's dependent on the karn board
[2022-12-21 17:32:36] <+luinil_mtg> Black lotus is a mana source so you can mystical for it in play as written
[2022-12-21 17:32:55] <$argentorum> @hmmyespanda Karn is the win con of monogreen, the best deck in the format?
[2022-12-21 17:33:13] <@%+ItsSimonDS> sb cards are probably less impactful in pio too
[2022-12-21 17:33:18] <+Man0warr1> Any Jace deck in Pioneer would lose to Mono Green Devo
[2022-12-21 17:33:21] <+carnivale1523> Black lotus is better than karn
[2022-12-21 17:33:23] <%+Bambino430> Lilliana was a bust in Pioneer because of Cruise and Dig Thru time
[2022-12-21 17:33:30] <+rueler18> Crazy how fetch lands make all cards better lol
[2022-12-21 17:33:33] <@%+hmmyespanda> i'm not so sure on that. but ok
[2022-12-21 17:33:46] <%Claudiohmtg> its even clear jtms is better than emperor to me
[2022-12-21 17:33:47] <+infest3d> black lotus is a mono artifact so not the same @argentorum Kappa
[2022-12-21 17:33:49] <%Claudiohmtg> its not even*
[2022-12-21 17:33:49] <+GatoGelato00> JTMS is not gonna fix any of Pio UW's problems
[2022-12-21 17:33:54] <%+TobyBarobyLLC> Karn is also busted in Pioneer!
[2022-12-21 17:34:00] <dougie_doug391> Is Karn “good” against hammer?
[2022-12-21 17:34:06] VIEWERS: 1 304
[2022-12-21 17:34:13] <@%+ItsSimonDS> again they're just really different cards. karn is like a weird prison/big mana card and jace is just a midrange card
[2022-12-21 17:34:14] <%+badrocker19> Karn gets better with every single sideboard playable artifact.
[2022-12-21 17:34:17] <Ratgina> pioneer doesnt have fetches jace would be ass
[2022-12-21 17:34:17] <%Arcbound_Twerker> what about COMPLEATED JTMS
[2022-12-21 17:34:22] <+luinil_mtg> Karn is more played than jace in legacy
[2022-12-21 17:34:29] <+Man0warr1> Karn is a bit slow vs Hammer, even on Turn 3
[2022-12-21 17:34:30] <+MinaturtIe> Yo, it's the "Lose to boseju" deck
[2022-12-21 17:34:30] <%+badrocker19> While Jace only gets better with more shuffle effects
[2022-12-21 17:34:30] <+luinil_mtg> Arguably in vintage too
[2022-12-21 17:34:34] <@%+ItsSimonDS> agree that karn is more powerful overall
[2022-12-21 17:34:41] <+Man0warr1> Maybe in Ponza, with interaction
[2022-12-21 17:34:55] <@%+esqpoe> Spike, what is your take on Eggnog?

[2022-12-21 17:37:42] <dougie_doug391> Mister Spike,,, would turn the earth be a good card for food sideboard???
[2022-12-21 17:37:42] <%+altwincons> Have you missed anything from the mono white version of the deck?
[2022-12-21 17:38:07] VIEWERS: 1 319
[2022-12-21 17:38:19] <Dressedspring1> If your blind mulligan is to keep the combo pieces like this, is there consideration to a third ballista to increase the number of games you can win on t4?
[2022-12-21 17:38:29] <@%Squee_GoblinNabob> can arcanist your iterations pog
[2022-12-21 17:38:29] <%+RedWinter31> those all sound like pioneer cards
[2022-12-21 17:38:38] <MaxBreaker87> arcanist with 2power could recurr s9me nice spells
[2022-12-21 17:38:43] <pezhmanahnas> you could play arcanist, recomission and see the truth
[2022-12-21 17:38:46] <sexy_andy> I always appreciate your work and dedication but the last decks you came with recently, especially this and Titania were really really enjoyable. So many thanks again :)
[2022-12-21 17:38:49] <%+offusk> but you can become immense arcanist and then it can target it again on the attack on the same turn. Beeg damage

[2022-12-21 17:54:59] <rowrow_> opp still puts the hammer on nexus that turn if we don't block sentinel
[2022-12-21 17:55:02] <+luinil_mtg> If we don’t chump we can respond to the nexus animation by saccing
[2022-12-21 17:55:08] <%+Mugg_> solitude had to hit inkmoth, if they had second hammer the sentinel kiled you
[2022-12-21 17:55:14] <rowrow_> but yeah that prob works best
[2022-12-21 17:55:20] <+luinil_mtg> They had the nuts and we missed on a wide range of draws

[2022-12-21 17:57:36] <@%Dragonlord_Freya> It's usually not okay if it's intentional but determining if it is interntional is difficult
[2022-12-21 17:57:40] <Rengaw87> !slowroll
[2022-12-21 17:57:41] <rowrow_> slow roll started as a poker term. When you have the best hand, but pretend to think about "calling" when an opponent bets into you
[2022-12-21 17:57:41] <%Bonsheen> In my experience a slow roll isn’t typically malicious
[2022-12-21 17:57:44] <@%+hmmyespanda> opp clearly trying to irk me
[2022-12-21 17:57:49] <+luinil_mtg> Slow rolling is when my opponents do it and when I do it, it’s playing correctly.
[2022-12-21 17:57:55] <@%Dragonlord_Freya> @donaldisaduck Doubt it, I didn't see Caleb playing it last night
[2022-12-21 17:57:55] <%HugHeist> I'm bad about playing scared

[2022-12-21 17:59:21] <sexy_andy> Don't you feel that the fact you're cutting or trimming Recomission most of the time shows that the cards is just a win more?

[2022-12-21 18:01:20] <+monkeyscantcry> also - when bringing in noncreatures (moon, chalice, w/t) siding out creatures makes recommission worse while siding out recommission doesnt make your creatures worse

[2022-12-21 18:06:24] <%joymonger> Recommission is a card that may not be necessary to win but in today’s fairly interactive modern meta, it’s a desirable card that can sometimes just win you the game in the right circumstances

[2022-12-21 19:13:42] <@%+TurtlePowerMTG> ^^^
[2022-12-21 19:13:43] <%Aquinas9> I have heard stories of some many RCQs that capped at 8 people, had single elimination events, or literally only one person at the event wanted to travel to San Diego so won the invite just by showing up. No games necessary.
[2022-12-21 19:13:45] <@%+CurdBros> The only rule is there are no rules
[2022-12-21 19:13:45] <!%$unexistant> Lol, we had all sorts of goofy "cuts" over the last couple months of local RCQ's, some were just started as a "top 8" cause only 8 showed up.
[2022-12-21 19:13:46] <%+makeshiftreaper> I top 8'd a 16 person rcq and they last moment decided to cut to 4 and then the guy who beat me dropped to top 4 beat me to go hang out with his friends
[2022-12-21 19:13:48] <+Optimus_Tom> there's a ruleset for tournament structure for X players and formats you need to play
[2022-12-21 19:13:48] <+absoluteragez> how long is all access token live for
[2022-12-21 19:13:49] <+Auterhaus> then there are Canadian RCQs where an invite is basically a birthright
[2022-12-21 19:13:53] <defnados> My favorite are the limited ones with exactly 8. Just a draft for the invite.

[2022-12-21 19:40:58] <Lazarenth> my painter deck in legacy already had to deal with meltdown now it has to deal with brotherhood end
[2022-12-21 19:41:35] <%Aquinas9> @gianlook1 It's a refreshing change of gameplay from 'land, creature, removal spell, pass'. This deck works on a completely different axis. I actually compare it to playing Lands in Legacy which also makes you play the game on totally different rules of engagement.
[2022-12-21 19:41:51] <%+blba123> getting all surge nodes will win us like 99%
[2022-12-21 19:41:54] <+huskerpaul> ggs Spike, I just played you on gobbos.  Sorry for the late G2 scoop, haven't seen your deck before :)

[2022-12-21 19:43:03] <Lock1102> why do you loose your sage?
[2022-12-21 19:43:06] <resplendentrice> Might be a bad place to ask; but when I completely reinstall mtgo it never opens the launcher, it attempts to and closes instantly. Anyone know a fix?

[2022-12-21 19:43:17] <resplendentrice> Can’t find a fix online
[2022-12-21 19:43:29] <%Aquinas9> We can keep Saga. Destroy Binding in response to the chapter 3 trigger, then activate Power Conduit to move the lore counter, then search for a Chalice with Saga.

[2022-12-21 19:44:40] <%Aquinas9> I like fetching Haywire Mite. It can trade with Ragan or unlock our Conduit by exiling OP's binding.

[2022-12-21 19:51:45] <CrazyEddie_> Restrictions mostly just increase variance, if you draw your restricted cards then you win and otherwise you lose
