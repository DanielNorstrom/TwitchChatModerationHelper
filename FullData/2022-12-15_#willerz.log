[2022-12-15 19:27:19] <%+impactblu_> they use trenches to keep the lines more secure and less chances for it to be broken at some point @WillerZ
[2022-12-15 19:27:19] <%+gaskiller62> they should be boring in the conduit. then pull lines.
[2022-12-15 19:27:19] <SexyAhsoka> at least next to the house

[2022-12-15 21:58:27] <@%SheefGG> @realherrera it’s 10000% a guess. I have NOOOO clue :(
[2022-12-15 21:58:28] <BrainbowR6> have we ever had a monday wipe?
[2022-12-15 21:58:38] <%+Internet_Roamer> @StreamUncle UPS has a battery that will keep your stuff powered
[2022-12-15 21:58:42] <%+TheYellaKing> once they add all body armor hit boxes.. wenis meta will take over
[2022-12-15 21:58:43] <+BakedPotatoNoScope> @StreamUncle UPS is like a small battery backup that will give you a few minutes to shut down if power fails.

[2022-12-15 21:59:51] <DrippYMoTioNz> should have gave him the wooden hand guard
[2022-12-15 21:59:52] <%naughtapinata> @StreamUncle The UPS also provides surge protection, so it goes wall -> UPS -.Computer, monitor, etc
[2022-12-15 21:59:56] <+DeadIceMan> @WillerZ how do we get on the list to provide a kit

[2022-12-15 22:00:38] <BrainbowR6> They don't last long though, typically just long enough to wrap up whatever you may be doing
[2022-12-15 22:00:39] <jollexes> Love the barrel handle on it
[2022-12-15 22:00:39] <+DRu990> a byproduct of a UPS is that it's a power conditioner too
[2022-12-15 22:00:41] <StreamUncle> so Ups is better than surge protector as it does both correct?

[2022-12-15 22:00:49] <%UnSweetndT> the batteries are usually good enough to run long enough for you to get your shit in order before shutting down the PC

[2022-12-15 22:01:18] <+NileRiver666> UPS last about 2-4 years from what I noticed. They’re good to give you time to power down everything properly.
[2022-12-15 22:01:19] <%WazzuHahn> Tap fast.

[2022-12-15 22:01:24] <%Ms_SyKleZ> it's design to give you extra time to shut down everything while the power is out.
[2022-12-15 22:01:25] <dfields1515> Good luck lol
[2022-12-15 22:01:26] <MeYeaaa> THIS
[2022-12-15 22:01:28] <%naughtapinata> UPS matters a lot more with servers cause if you're hosting virtual machines and the host dies, it can corrupt the VM

[2022-12-15 22:06:16] <%smoke802x> no he said he isnt happy with the state but cant see himself playing anything else
[2022-12-15 22:06:18] <%+shashman> Glorious would NOT say that. He can't stop repeating how EFT is his favourite game of all time that he will always love. He's literally said the opposite of that LUL

[2022-12-15 22:17:22] <yaootja> @smoke802x the thing is games are sold for content creators specifically, it's their job to create content for the game, not the devs to cater to it. I digress, though lol

[2022-12-15 22:17:34] <@%beezy> hes matching a min already
[2022-12-15 22:17:38] <ZenCaeWood> Not worth. The game is hot doodoo
[2022-12-15 22:17:40] <%+2L33Zy> @beezy oh
[2022-12-15 22:17:40] <+kvvalid> Leveling the guns is the only fun thing about the game
[2022-12-15 22:17:45] <PowRTorcH> DMZ is fun as hell. It’s a different game tho

[2022-12-15 22:17:52] <+xRaick> DMZ is sooooo bad
[2022-12-15 22:17:52] <PowRTorcH> Can’t compare the 2
[2022-12-15 22:17:53] <+whathappenedtv> @ZenCaeWood most of the time if you shoot and then go behind a wall or go where they cant see you they will run around like chicken
[2022-12-15 22:17:54] <%3pieces> yea a million diff guns and you even have to use ones you dont want to just to unlock a specific attachment
[2022-12-15 22:17:55] <XHighHammerX> Warzone is a dumpster fire. Its a total mess.
[2022-12-15 22:18:01] <@%beezy> respect the drip @2L33Zy
[2022-12-15 22:18:01] <%brothermanhobo> I am the type of motherfucker that gets jumpscared when I get shot randomly lol
[2022-12-15 22:18:09] <root_Zz> DMZ will never be Tarkov
[2022-12-15 22:18:15] <realherrera> @WillerZ lol i know dmz isnt better just wanna see some people get hype for tarky!
[2022-12-15 22:18:16] <PowRTorcH> DMZ runs better than warzone their flagship game mode LMAO
[2022-12-15 22:18:20] <ZenCaeWood> @whathappenedtv Betttt thanks for the tip bruh
[2022-12-15 22:18:20] <+Blaze__308> the enjoyment i get from dmz is completely different from tarkov. Dmz feels like a chill, casual game to relax with friends. Tarkov feels nothing like that.
[2022-12-15 22:18:22] <+mrqvp> can i go sleep ?
[2022-12-15 22:18:25] <yaootja> COD makes garbage to sell skins
[2022-12-15 22:18:25] <DankBizzer> Also, ive seen quite a bit of dmz players coming to tarky because they want a more realistic experience
[2022-12-15 22:18:26] <%3pieces> yea casual arcady experience
[2022-12-15 22:18:29] <+kvvalid> @WillerZ did you see that DMZ was adding a labs like area in the game ? KEKW you need a key to access as well
[2022-12-15 22:18:29] <romp3rstomp3r07> i rather play tarkov over cod any day KEKW
[2022-12-15 22:18:30] <%+hennyolo> DMZ has 0 long time motivation
[2022-12-15 22:18:34] <%+carelessduckyy> is it normal for me to jolt my entire body when i get shot in game or even when i die?
[2022-12-15 22:18:34] <BrainbowR6> People will buy cod every year but complain about buying EOD and playing it for 5 years
[2022-12-15 22:18:36] <%ExCAL1BURx_x> inflation be hitting hard, 7 dollars cad for a sub now lmao
[2022-12-15 22:18:40] <%3pieces> basically what cod has been for the last 10yrs
[2022-12-15 22:18:41] <%+stribbits> Casual and free with a dash of "easy enough for chimp brains"
[2022-12-15 22:18:42] <C1emmons> is there currently an event
[2022-12-15 22:18:44] <%smoke802x> @yaootja nah i disagree with that 100% game company's dont care about streamers they care about trying to tap into the Asian market or like will just said the casual players thats where the money is
[2022-12-15 22:18:45] <harcomo> who is playing dmz? its dog shit....
[2022-12-15 22:18:46] <%brothermanhobo> DMZ doesn't feel like the stakes are quite as high

[2022-12-15 22:27:18] <%Lobotomiked> Well shit, once you’ve earned the viewers and have people donating kits, I wouldn’t pick up shit either 😂😂
[2022-12-15 22:27:23] <%GunnyHighway23> the fact that everyone is loot hungry is why i fear an apocalypse. just looters everywhere

[2022-12-15 22:29:04] <%Lobotomiked> No that’s what I’m saying @willerz lol. The first part of the wipe of course is self earned but you know what I’m saying. No point in picking shit up when you’ve got money in the bank.
[2022-12-15 22:29:12] <+s_saiyan7> When you die, do you keep the experience gained? Like from looting, eating, healing, running, etc?
[2022-12-15 22:29:16] <hellziak> Sup @WillerZ
[2022-12-15 22:29:16] <eatinv> Never put that on your dog
