[2023-01-11 12:03:36] <$TheNorseCrow> I love me some Forge action
[2023-01-11 12:03:55] <$TheNorseCrow> Visage is insane on Blitz though
[2023-01-11 12:03:55] <UGOTC00KIES> does phony frontline dummies count as dead units for admin?
[2023-01-11 12:03:55] <@%^Moobot> Share your clips from the stream, post your food pics and hang with the community while the stream is offline! All over at: https://discord.gg/sp4zie
[2023-01-11 12:03:57] <imweszzz> @Evilzebuput You don't want to. It keeps the same amount of Camille's in the pool of champions. So if you leave the orb you have slightly higher chance of rolling Camille in the shop.
