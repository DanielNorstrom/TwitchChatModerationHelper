[2022-12-07 23:32:13] <@%Gibster99> @maisieairen The game defaults to showing that when you don't have the texture on your PC so you have to download counter strike source to see them

[2022-12-07 23:32:36] <@%Wloos> In my experience, Gmod used to use textures from other games for their community servers. You needed Counter Strike Source installed or else you'd get those purple and black textures or a massive error.
