[2022-12-07 13:02:24] <+the_cheat> he probably could have just won if he had waited a while
[2022-12-07 13:02:27] <+gold_dragoon13> some random local signed on lol
[2022-12-07 13:02:32] <+the_cheat> and let good will build up
[2022-12-07 13:02:41] <+thewaffle77> crazy cause i feel like people like him are the average rich person
[2022-12-07 13:02:44] VIEWERS: 479
[2022-12-07 13:02:50] <%n0ne> put he tried to grow too fast
[2022-12-07 13:02:52] <%n0ne> thats the truth
[2022-12-07 13:02:59] <+dahltz> Nintendo fucked him over lmao, funniest part mangoFudge
[2022-12-07 13:03:00] <%n0ne> bad business methods
[2022-12-07 13:03:09] <sketchnin> im def going to start going to more tournaments in the future. give my support
[2022-12-07 13:03:09] <Ninortwitch> ya that's true @n0ne
[2022-12-07 13:03:12] <+murgatroidsp> @thewaffle77 yea this behavior is not that unusual in certain industries
[2022-12-07 13:03:14] <Ninortwitch> didn't understand the scene
[2022-12-07 13:03:16] <Zyph73> He didn't even try to grow it, he tried to just plant his flag on other people's events it seems like
[2022-12-07 13:03:17] <+Vande14y> how is a ceo this bad at business
[2022-12-07 13:03:19] <TheSoupKitchenX> Lets not forget that Nintendo still sucks in all of this.
[2022-12-07 13:03:23] <jimborojo> @thewaffle77 i feel like he thinks everyone is gullible and dumb
[2022-12-07 13:03:28] <sketchnin> @dahltz i feel like nintendo was just using panda as a vehicle for control and i would like to learn more about that
[2022-12-07 13:03:51] <uptiltcheese> hes such a bullshitter
[2022-12-07 13:03:51] <+Boggelz> i remember the dota days when it was joinDota vs Bts and they had a lot of personality
[2022-12-07 13:03:52] <Ninortwitch> blur says the've done that a lot in the past @sketchnin
[2022-12-07 13:03:55] <+RlKU> from now on I'll only trust an org that got it out the mud
[2022-12-07 13:04:03] <+Boggelz> seeing the corporate side of it is weird
[2022-12-07 13:04:08] <Ninortwitch> specifically nintendo with the community
[2022-12-07 13:04:08] <+thewaffle77> whole time bro keeps expressing he doin this for the love of the game
[2022-12-07 13:04:10] <+thewaffle77> thats cap
[2022-12-07 13:04:18] <+thewaffle77> you wouldnt have to explain that shit
[2022-12-07 13:04:18] <ocean2c> is the dota contract they lost just for sea dpc coverage
[2022-12-07 13:04:19] <+thewaffle77> if you did
[2022-12-07 13:04:28] <+thewaffle77> niggas would just know
[2022-12-07 13:04:32] <+420mlgegg> also being a competitor is good for the TO's it means their going to be getting better shit
[2022-12-07 13:04:35] <+Vande14y> mangoFudge mangoN
[2022-12-07 13:04:36] <DMquil> also, he's saying stuff like "BTS and VGBC stand to gain so much by killing Panda"... so that means you admit there is a competition?
[2022-12-07 13:04:36] <Ninortwitch> facts
[2022-12-07 13:04:45] VIEWERS: 479
[2022-12-07 13:04:54] <meatbrawls> from what others have said he was dismissive of melee, opposite of supportive
[2022-12-07 13:05:01] <bb010g> @dmquil or he wants to paint them as greedy
[2022-12-07 13:05:09] <itsIzumi> it's not a competition because alan expected to sweep them CoolCat
[2022-12-07 13:05:16] <twitchIsWEB> Alan yelling in frustration "Why won't you work with us???" really says so much 😬
[2022-12-07 13:05:18] <Ninortwitch> maybe your brain is melting cause cody is right and you can't understand his business stratagem blur
[2022-12-07 13:05:30] <Ninortwitch> get on his level
[2022-12-07 13:05:36] <+murgatroidsp> A lot of it is kind of the same dumb shit
[2022-12-07 13:05:43] <+gold_dragoon13> @Ninortwitch hboxBrain
[2022-12-07 13:05:58] <+Boggelz> this 100% seems like he overpromised the community involvement to ninty
[2022-12-07 13:06:26] <MightyFalcon> @thewaffle77 its pretty clear to me that he doesnt care about the game at all. he just wants control of the space for some stupid ass reason
[2022-12-07 13:06:33] <+the_cheat> good thing ed talked to boback and sheridan and shi and trey and aaron all individually in the days after alan's threat
[2022-12-07 13:06:45] VIEWERS: 479
[2022-12-07 13:06:48] <+thewaffle77> @MightyFalcon he just keeps explaining it
[2022-12-07 13:06:52] <+thewaffle77> thats the L right there
[2022-12-07 13:07:02] <+the_cheat> like it wasn't just us malding lol
[2022-12-07 13:07:05] <Zyph73> The guy who couldn't fill out a calendar thinks he was going to take all these events from BTS?
[2022-12-07 13:07:13] <+peter_325> dannnnnnnnnnnng
[2022-12-07 13:07:19] <+Xjustified> We have half of it to go, including plenty of images lol
[2022-12-07 13:07:22] <Ninortwitch> appreciate staying up for this, doing god's work
[2022-12-07 13:07:23] <+Boggelz> @MightyFalcon The reason is not really that stupid: lots of money in the scene and he was the liason for it all. He just tried to do it way too fast
[2022-12-07 13:07:26] <tenshinara> JESUS LANGUAGE???
[2022-12-07 13:07:27] <bb010g> Smash Jesus
[2022-12-07 13:07:30] <+Boggelz> and shot himself in the foot
[2022-12-07 13:07:30] <%n0ne> this is like bible language yea
[2022-12-07 13:07:31] <+strata_gem> Jesus language lmao, stealing that
[2022-12-07 13:07:47] <BlaickRedDragon> it's dat bible shit bruh yo
[2022-12-07 13:07:49] <itsIzumi> aiden said nintendo really hated the arcadian specifically LUL
[2022-12-07 13:07:49] <Ninortwitch> ya, as if
[2022-12-07 13:08:03] <vadersnemesis> this guy has a serious god complex and martyr complex lmao
[2022-12-07 13:08:07] <%n0ne> he still HAS to vouch for nintendo, hes under contract
[2022-12-07 13:08:12] <+Xjustified> Where is the counter
[2022-12-07 13:08:24] <bb010g> @itsizumi do you know the reasons?
[2022-12-07 13:08:27] <Zyph73> He's at more self reports than correct sentences
[2022-12-07 13:08:30] <+murgatroidsp> The self reports definition outnumber the true sentences
[2022-12-07 13:08:42] <+murgatroidsp> And it’s not close
[2022-12-07 13:08:45] VIEWERS: 468
[2022-12-07 13:08:47] <itsIzumi> just because they weren't involved I guess
[2022-12-07 13:08:49] <%n0ne> is dr alan a journalist
[2022-12-07 13:09:07] <@$DracoDiabolus> blurW
[2022-12-07 13:09:17] <$Corneria> This is possibly the worst statement I've ever seen
[2022-12-07 13:09:32] <tillermalone> wait what did nintendo do about papa johns sponsorship?
[2022-12-07 13:09:36] <tenshinara> like, what if they DID have an issue with papa johns then what does alan do lol
[2022-12-07 13:09:45] <+gold_dragoon13> @n0ne he a nintendo higher up that was planted in the community
[2022-12-07 13:10:05] <Ninortwitch> keep it in chat bby

[2022-12-07 13:13:20] <Ninortwitch> remember, don't send hate to him chat. This is just to inform people how to move forward
[2022-12-07 13:13:23] <Ninortwitch> as bad as this is
[2022-12-07 13:13:37] <Hyper_flux> I hope more people can know about the contradictions and bs in this statement
[2022-12-07 13:13:41] <+thewaffle77> to play devils advocate, yall couldve just told bro to kick rocks @the_cheat
[2022-12-07 13:13:47] <DesertSnoopy> blur just wanted to tell you that im glad youre part of the community. keep being a real one SeemsGood
[2022-12-07 13:13:59] <sketchnin> yeah literally everything he learns he just tells nintendo
[2022-12-07 13:14:06] <%n0ne> alan eats boneless wings
[2022-12-07 13:14:15] <+Xjustified> @n0ne DAMN
[2022-12-07 13:14:18] <+LaffsNotLaughs> If his angle is that he’s innocent why did he step down and why did Panda say he behaved inappropriately??
[2022-12-07 13:14:34] <Ninortwitch> @n0ne he prob eats boneless wings with his fingers and still gets them dirty
[2022-12-07 13:14:35] <DoubleL_14> leave the wings out of this :(

[2022-12-07 13:14:47] <+strata_gem> Ken did refute that on Twitter tho
[2022-12-07 13:14:47] VIEWERS: 458
[2022-12-07 13:14:48] <bb010g> People are saying that the quote he gives there isn't even from their actual NDAs
[2022-12-07 13:14:54] <+the_cheat> @thewaffle77 the crazy thing after all of this is that we thought there might be a chance that panda was the best option left lol
[2022-12-07 13:14:55] <%n0ne> i agree with ken for this btw
[2022-12-07 13:15:01] <+murgatroidsp> I don’t even know what that’s about
[2022-12-07 13:15:18] <+peter_325> i hope he sues for libel and looses
[2022-12-07 13:15:18] <itsIzumi> this is a fair point imo
[2022-12-07 13:15:18] <+the_cheat> if they built up enough good will and did there was no other way to operate
[2022-12-07 13:15:32] <TheSoupKitchenX> I think running a tournament is fine though, no? Circuit? Maybe not.
[2022-12-07 13:15:33] <+the_cheat> accidentally a word there lol
[2022-12-07 13:15:35] <+the_cheat> but you get it
[2022-12-07 13:15:38] <+thewaffle77> @the_cheat okay thats tough
[2022-12-07 13:15:45] <+murgatroidsp> Yea definitely
[2022-12-07 13:15:46] <Ninortwitch> honestly this is just a fair dig against alan's product, it's fair
[2022-12-07 13:15:47] <+the_cheat> we didn't want to close off the option in case we were left with none
[2022-12-07 13:15:48] <+thewaffle77> thats a great point
[2022-12-07 13:15:49] <meatbrawls> amsa?
[2022-12-07 13:15:54] <%n0ne> now we can ban zumping btw
[2022-12-07 13:15:57] <+thewaffle77> does the NBA have an NBA team
[2022-12-07 13:16:03] <MightyFalcon> this feels like a personal attack on ken chen at this point
[2022-12-07 13:16:03] <+murgatroidsp> That would be like the cowboys controlling the nfl schedule
[2022-12-07 13:16:04] <+thewaffle77> the NBA team vs the Lakers
[2022-12-07 13:16:08] <+the_cheat> they did own the hornets briefly lol
[2022-12-07 13:16:10] <+dahltz> Ibdw and Plup were robbed of their wins smh
[2022-12-07 13:16:33] <ricknad> @thewaffle77 they did when they vetod that chris paul trade
[2022-12-07 13:16:34] <jimborojo> yeah during the chris paul trade
[2022-12-07 13:16:36] <+murgatroidsp> Yea but that’s because the hornets are a shitshow
[2022-12-07 13:16:39] <Hyper_flux> every single point alan makes can almost be boiled down to "this person was mean to me or didn't give me what I want"
[2022-12-07 13:16:45] <%n0ne> couldnt ban zumping before bc panda conflict of interest

[2022-12-07 13:21:42] <+strata_gem> depends if you believe him about how excited he was
[2022-12-07 13:21:43] <+murgatroidsp> He might rack up some trues here
[2022-12-07 13:21:44] <bb010g> Alan has emotions
[2022-12-07 13:21:48] <Ninortwitch> he can be true about his feelings, nice

[2022-12-07 13:21:57] <+Xjustified> We will give it to him

[2022-12-07 13:22:04] <guardianeb> 6
[2022-12-07 13:22:08] <+strata_gem> It's very plausible at least
[2022-12-07 13:22:15] <+murgatroidsp> Are we sure he has emotions?
[2022-12-07 13:22:19] <jimborojo> yeah Ken brings out emotion in Alan
[2022-12-07 13:22:20] <tenshinara> cherry picked emotions

[2022-12-07 13:24:18] <tenshinara> yeah but we already deduced he cant feel emotions blur
[2022-12-07 13:24:19] <%n0ne> its also playing victim
[2022-12-07 13:24:21] <%n0ne> so idk
[2022-12-07 13:24:25] <+Boggelz> its foreshadowing
[2022-12-07 13:24:25] <tenshinara> only ken makes him feel emotions
[2022-12-07 13:24:27] <ocean2c> i guess but
[2022-12-07 13:24:28] <tenshinara> nothing else
[2022-12-07 13:24:36] <+Vande14y> how were you this in over your head and working on this for 4 YEARS

[2022-12-07 13:28:34] <+murgatroidsp> The hotbid shit was unhinged

[2022-12-07 13:30:59] <+Xjustified> @ricknad THat is coming up yeah
[2022-12-07 13:31:01] <Ninortwitch> no death threats chat
[2022-12-07 13:31:02] <+LaffsNotLaughs> I’m sure he can go back to being a Doctor lmfao
[2022-12-07 13:31:34] <ReubTheDoob> Do we know that he cares about the community?
[2022-12-07 13:31:34] <+murgatroidsp> @ninortwitch I feel like the people in here are probably not the ones sending death threats
[2022-12-07 13:31:34] <SwarmEngine> just tragic
[2022-12-07 13:31:39] <+Xjustified> It is feels bad man for him a bit, but especially for the people around him.
[2022-12-07 13:31:43] <MightyFalcon> awhhh poor alan :'(
[2022-12-07 13:31:45] <Ninortwitch> @murgatroidsp true true
[2022-12-07 13:32:00] <MightyFalcon> poor poor alan boohooooooo
[2022-12-07 13:32:04] <itsIzumi> FeelsBadMan
[2022-12-07 13:32:05] <uptiltcheese> boo who go back to work as a doctor and get over paid for that shit im sure he does that for the love of the community
[2022-12-07 13:32:10] <+the_cheat> love and empathy but also don't talk to me or my son (ken chen) ever again
[2022-12-07 13:32:11] <Ninortwitch> @murgatroidsp i was just saying because alan is getting exposed here prob more than anywhere else lol
[2022-12-07 13:32:21] <+murgatroidsp> Yea that’s fair
[2022-12-07 13:32:21] <+Boggelz> tbh even through all of this, i still hate nintendo more than this guy
[2022-12-07 13:32:22] <+Xjustified> @the_cheat exactly
[2022-12-07 13:32:24] <ch0l1n3> I'm down to feel bad for him if he were to show an inkling of remorse, which does not seem to be the case
[2022-12-07 13:32:37] <ocean2c> mangoFudge stop shit talking ken alan.
[2022-12-07 13:32:46] <+murgatroidsp> Yea I thought of that
[2022-12-07 13:32:46] <+dahltz> The moral of the story is dont work with Nintendo, they’ll fuck you even unintentionally.
[2022-12-07 13:32:49] <tillermalone> I already saw 2 bad reviews of his practice
[2022-12-07 13:32:49] <Dezbrah> it won't hurt him at all
[2022-12-07 13:32:50] <+murgatroidsp> Fuck no
[2022-12-07 13:32:51] VIEWERS: 444
[2022-12-07 13:32:52] <itsIzumi> i think my doctor has probably killed someone before to be honest
[2022-12-07 13:32:53] <+Boggelz> at least he wanted to bring something to the scene, even if he did it in a shitty, manipulative way
[2022-12-07 13:32:53] <MightyFalcon> maybe dr alan should work in retail for awhile after this
[2022-12-07 13:32:54] <+LaffsNotLaughs> He can change his name
[2022-12-07 13:32:54] <tillermalone> When I searched up his name
[2022-12-07 13:32:55] <Dezbrah> who googles a doctor
[2022-12-07 13:32:55] <Roryx> bro my dr is alan I'm gonna die
[2022-12-07 13:32:55] <+Xjustified> He will have to go major not his own practice at this point
[2022-12-07 13:32:58] <SwarmEngine> digital footprint is real
[2022-12-07 13:33:01] <+Boggelz> im used to nintendo just wrecking shit
[2022-12-07 13:33:04] <Dezbrah> unless he is in a General Practice
[2022-12-07 13:33:07] <housefromtn> I spell his name wrong on purpose, that's the only kindness he's getting from me
[2022-12-07 13:33:15] <MightyFalcon> i have 0 sympathy tbh, i dont give a fuck about him
[2022-12-07 13:33:17] <+thewaffle77> @TheCrimsonBlur you think he'll learn from it?
[2022-12-07 13:33:20] <Ninortwitch> I think this isn't bad enough to cancel a doctor. Docttors have killed people in improper procedures and they still get jobs
[2022-12-07 13:33:25] <vaardark> i understand alan being ignorant of all this to business, but what is nintendo's excuse
[2022-12-07 13:33:28] <Ninortwitch> it makes it harder though
[2022-12-07 13:33:36] <itsIzumi> @vaardark they are nintendo
[2022-12-07 13:33:42] <+Xjustified> He said his company didn't take VCs at some point near the end iirc
[2022-12-07 13:33:43] <+murgatroidsp> I think no matter what it feels really shitty to fuck up this badly
[2022-12-07 13:33:51] <vaardark> feels like a pawn tho
[2022-12-07 13:34:05] <Ninortwitch> he was just a noob nintendo fan
[2022-12-07 13:34:08] <itsIzumi> cares about ultimate for sure
[2022-12-07 13:34:16] <+the_cheat> LOL
[2022-12-07 13:34:16] <bb010g> @vaardark they don't need one; they're a huge corporation
[2022-12-07 13:34:17] <+the_cheat> blur come on
[2022-12-07 13:34:18] <+murgatroidsp> I feel empathy for pretty much anyone who gets destroyed on twitter, except like mitch mcconnell
[2022-12-07 13:34:20] <@+PR_Kevin> according to kodorin, he basically only cared about ult LUL
[2022-12-07 13:34:21] <housefromtn> seems like he has a complete inability to understand that other people have perspectives
[2022-12-07 13:34:23] <SwarmEngine> It would be really hard to not learn SOMETHING from this
[2022-12-07 13:34:23] <@+PR_Kevin> so no sympathy from me
[2022-12-07 13:34:26] <+the_cheat> "maybe the scene needs a strong man"
[2022-12-07 13:34:28] <SwarmEngine> looool
[2022-12-07 13:34:29] <Dezbrah> he didn't listen to you... eloborate
[2022-12-07 13:34:36] <housefromtn> he never listened to anyone
[2022-12-07 13:34:40] <TheSoupKitchenX> Do you think Panda is done for? Or can they stay/return?
[2022-12-07 13:34:41] <+thewaffle77> i think hes
[2022-12-07 13:34:41] <Hyper_flux> it sounds like he was ready to sell out the melee scene
[2022-12-07 13:34:42] <nifaso> Edwin also coroborated that he only cared about ulti
[2022-12-07 13:34:47] <ReubTheDoob> I don’t hope the guy suffers, but im not convinced he saw smash as anything but a business to make money off of
[2022-12-07 13:34:47] <+thewaffle77> whats the word
[2022-12-07 13:34:48] <Ninortwitch> if he listened to you, ibdw couldn't say he was smarter than you though
[2022-12-07 13:34:48] <+peter_325> I wonder what plup thinks
[2022-12-07 13:34:52] VIEWERS: 444
[2022-12-07 13:34:53] <Ninortwitch> so that wasant an option
[2022-12-07 13:34:55] <%n0ne> do u think nintendo makes a statement about this. Theyre clearly involved if they greenlighted panda cup postponement @blur
[2022-12-07 13:34:55] <+thewaffle77> he got a god complex
[2022-12-07 13:34:59] <+strata_gem> They've lost too many staff and players at this point
[2022-12-07 13:35:09] <+murgatroidsp> Based on this statement I don’t think he’s going to learn from this
[2022-12-07 13:35:09] <@%^Nightbot> B A S E D
[2022-12-07 13:35:09] <bb010g> @thesoupkitchenx it sounds like their 2nd in command is also garbage from the screenshots Alan posted, soooo
[2022-12-07 13:35:09] <+Xjustified> Unless someone buys it and rebrands it is done
[2022-12-07 13:35:11] <w00j__> he mightve cared about ult. he certainly didnt care about melee
[2022-12-07 13:35:13] <+thewaffle77> narcissist is the word
[2022-12-07 13:35:15] <d00gal> Mf said panda 2
[2022-12-07 13:35:16] <+LaffsNotLaughs> I really wanted that controller, too :(
[2022-12-07 13:35:19] <TheSoupKitchenX> @bb010g that's no good.
[2022-12-07 13:35:21] <Roryx> their non smash people started leaving I think it's over
[2022-12-07 13:35:23] <ocean2c> @Dezbrah thecrimsonblur was the one who get the enemy at bay 8 long years mangoN
[2022-12-07 13:35:24] <+murgatroidsp> Yea he’s definitely a narcissist
[2022-12-07 13:35:26] <%n0ne> they kinda have to right
[2022-12-07 13:35:34] <ocean2c> kept*
[2022-12-07 13:35:35] <SwarmEngine> How might Nintendo react to this?
[2022-12-07 13:35:38] <housefromtn> I think narcissist is a dumb over used word but it 100% applies to him
[2022-12-07 13:35:44] <+Vande14y> no one was EVER getting that GCC
[2022-12-07 13:35:44] <Ninortwitch> sucked us dry
[2022-12-07 13:35:45] <+Boggelz> from someone i know in panda, apparently the new leadership council thing is a bunch of people who are really good people
[2022-12-07 13:35:49] <Ninortwitch> did they give refunds?
[2022-12-07 13:35:50] <ocean2c> get? why did i type get i need to sleep
[2022-12-07 13:35:51] <ch0l1n3> good thing phobs are a thing now.. but still
[2022-12-07 13:35:52] <+Boggelz> but its probably too little too late
[2022-12-07 13:35:55] <taijem> yea the controller woulda been revolutionary
[2022-12-07 13:35:57] <+the_cheat> great question
[2022-12-07 13:35:57] <+thewaffle77> @housefromtn i agree lol
[2022-12-07 13:36:02] <Archrid> @Ninortwitch It was canceled, so yeah.
[2022-12-07 13:36:03] <meatbrawls> that whole controller thing felt like a proof of interest for outside funding thing
[2022-12-07 13:36:05] <housefromtn> complete inability to understand that other people's thoughts have any validity or value
[2022-12-07 13:36:05] <Ninortwitch> nice
[2022-12-07 13:36:19] <+peter_325> chroma will
[2022-12-07 13:36:19] <TopHatMatt> well hold on
[2022-12-07 13:36:21] <TopHatMatt> for five dollars
[2022-12-07 13:36:23] <+the_cheat> chroma09
[2022-12-07 13:36:24] <SwarmEngine> stop??
[2022-12-07 13:36:26] <Ninortwitch> maybe if they're low enough for david
[2022-12-07 13:36:26] <tillermalone> I’ll step up
[2022-12-07 13:36:28] <Ninortwitch> ya
[2022-12-07 13:36:28] <TheSoupKitchenX> Hey maybe Nintendo can just fuck off though? That would be nice.
[2022-12-07 13:36:31] <+murgatroidsp> I’d buy them for like 50 cents
[2022-12-07 13:36:38] <%n0ne> i still dont think he'll sell
[2022-12-07 13:36:39] <shynesick> i can lend them a loan B)
[2022-12-07 13:36:39] <itsIzumi> chroma needs to make a gofundme
[2022-12-07 13:36:50] <housefromtn> how many mango coins is panda worth?
[2022-12-07 13:36:52] <TopHatMatt> even if he salvages who's even gonna trust them anymore
[2022-12-07 13:36:52] VIEWERS: 444
[2022-12-07 13:36:54] <Hyper_flux> I feel like this is a weird and messy enough situation that nintendo might just say nothing and back away
[2022-12-07 13:37:04] <ninedyfive> @housefromtn KEKW
[2022-12-07 13:37:08] <+the_cheat> we buy pands
[2022-12-07 13:37:14] <+the_cheat> we turn it into pepis global
[2022-12-07 13:37:18] <+FangJammin> do you think Nintendo is gonna cancel more tournaments?
[2022-12-07 13:37:19] <+murgatroidsp> Yea I don’t think nintendo will necessarily say anything
[2022-12-07 13:37:27] <w00j__> @the_cheat the true end goal
[2022-12-07 13:37:36] <uptiltcheese> @the_cheat that would honestly be so fuckin dope
[2022-12-07 13:37:41] <Zyph73> The real question is what would panda rebrand as
[2022-12-07 13:37:43] <bb010g> Nintendo doesn't *have* to say shit
[2022-12-07 13:37:45] <Wacklord> omg I came for the vod and your live

[2022-12-07 13:38:18] <housefromtn> @TheCrimsonBlur do you agree with ken that nintendo is actually scared of community backlash, I feel like the community downplays the power we have
[2022-12-07 13:38:25] <Ninortwitch> lfg splatoon
[2022-12-07 13:38:28] <excaliberssb> Have they been messing with melee since even before evo 2013?
[2022-12-07 13:38:40] <+thewaffle77> dr panda the suge knight of smash
[2022-12-07 13:38:44] <Archrid> @excaliberssb Yes.
[2022-12-07 13:38:46] <tenshinara> @thecrimsonblur splatoon players are planning to do it again btw i think
[2022-12-07 13:38:47] <+thewaffle77> i might tweet that lool
[2022-12-07 13:38:50] <+LaffsNotLaughs> @excaliberssb Brawl itself was a slight against Melee.
[2022-12-07 13:38:52] <tenshinara> theres like another event coming up

[2022-12-07 13:39:01] <%n0ne> alan the savior
[2022-12-07 13:39:02] <shynesick> love and empathy :)
[2022-12-07 13:39:03] <TheSoupKitchenX> yeah because if Panda wins, they Trojan horse and fuck the entire smash ecosystem

[2022-12-07 13:39:11] <+murgatroidsp> He was the perfect vessel
[2022-12-07 13:39:12] <ninedyfive> there's a trump analogy in there somewhere
[2022-12-07 13:39:13] <Ninortwitch> he's still licking their balls in this statement
[2022-12-07 13:39:19] <Ninortwitch> he has to though
[2022-12-07 13:39:20] <Zyph73> The devil doesn't need that kind of slander anyway
[2022-12-07 13:39:34] <+peter_325> a true chance to break free
[2022-12-07 13:39:37] <Archrid> @excaliberssb Indeed.
[2022-12-07 13:39:44] <+Boggelz> i am really proud of the community to not just roll over for nintendo this time
[2022-12-07 13:39:44] <bb010g> maybe that's why Alan thought Panda winning and making deals was inevitable
[2022-12-07 13:39:47] <%n0ne> #thanksalan

[2022-12-07 13:41:30] <Zyph73> And glitch and double down
[2022-12-07 13:41:31] <+murgatroidsp> I feel like we’re still down in material
[2022-12-07 13:41:40] <Ninortwitch> we care about our rooks, they're more than a piece
[2022-12-07 13:41:43] <+Boggelz> im just really hoping were not back in the C&D arc for smash
[2022-12-07 13:41:46] <+boba_ck> i hope sakurai is reading all this
[2022-12-07 13:41:49] <+dr_bovenbaas> @bb010g have we tried relation therapy?
[2022-12-07 13:41:55] <uptiltcheese> hopefully this makes nintendo take a step back and fuck off real shit they might fuck off
[2022-12-07 13:42:05] <poketrainer19> taking a queen usually confers a winning position, its more like we made a prophylactic measure in the style of petrosian
[2022-12-07 13:42:28] <bb010g> @dr_bovenbaas sure, let's schedule a date with NoA
[2022-12-07 13:42:34] <+the_cheat> :)
[2022-12-07 13:42:39] <excaliberssb> @LaffsNotLaughs Oh yeah, I feel like I vaguely remember that. They were messing with MLG, right?
[2022-12-07 13:42:45] <%n0ne> listen to me now, believe me later
[2022-12-07 13:42:45] <+Vande14y> I still feel like nintendo is going to try and C&D stuff
[2022-12-07 13:42:50] <ninedyfive> trumpian stuff
[2022-12-07 13:42:52] <Ninortwitch> And the To's? they love me (Donald Trump voice)
[2022-12-07 13:42:54] <+boba_ck> ofc we would leave the door open

[2022-12-07 13:42:57] <+boba_ck> why wouldnt we
[2022-12-07 13:43:02] <+Boggelz> i think having juggleguy in their corner gave him that one W he needed to think hes hot shit
[2022-12-07 13:43:07] <+LaffsNotLaughs> @archrid right, I forgot about that.
[2022-12-07 13:43:11] <+murgatroidsp> He does not have much social intelligence
[2022-12-07 13:43:15] <Archrid> @LaffsNotLaughs Yeah, stuff like that.
[2022-12-07 13:43:19] <bb010g> 12 events (unnamed)
[2022-12-07 13:43:22] <%n0ne> one per month prob
[2022-12-07 13:43:23] <sdj_ssbm> assuming the LTCs
[2022-12-07 13:43:25] <+boba_ck> they were mostly regionals i believe
[2022-12-07 13:43:25] <Ninortwitch> @TheCrimsonBlur no he's saying only 2 declined
[2022-12-07 13:43:28] <ninedyfive> welp, not anymore heh
[2022-12-07 13:43:29] <Ninortwitch> others didnt accept right?
[2022-12-07 13:43:32] <+gold_dragoon13> they all locals
[2022-12-07 13:43:38] <+murgatroidsp> I feel like he doesn’t know how humans work
[2022-12-07 13:43:38] <uptiltcheese> @vande14y itd be such bad press for them. i stg they tried to use panda to have their hand in the cookie jar cuz they know they cant cnd without blowback
[2022-12-07 13:43:38] <housefromtn> *entrants
[2022-12-07 13:43:44] <walkerite> joining the zoom call
[2022-12-07 13:43:48] <Ninortwitch> maybe
[2022-12-07 13:43:49] <+the_cheat> relevant re: alan not receiving feedback https://twitter.com/WireManFGC/status/1600425551499444225?s=20&t=t-TkZ72UH-e_MyvraMhSrA

[2022-12-07 13:44:06] <Ninortwitch> i would have written as 12 accepted if I had that, idk

[2022-12-07 13:44:58] <+murgatroidsp> Does he think absence of negative feedback is the same as approval?
[2022-12-07 13:45:02] <+the_cheat> i think also they gave their feedback to ed mostly
[2022-12-07 13:45:06] <+Vande14y> @uptiltcheese im still very worried for the scene considering the whole "this is how things are going to work now" stuff that was said in the original SWT cancelation announcement
[2022-12-07 13:45:42] <bb010g> Nintendo can't stop us from having tournaments & uploading Slippi replays
[2022-12-07 13:45:43] <MightyFalcon> its not hard if you give TOs a reason to want to work together
[2022-12-07 13:45:58] <+boba_ck> i wouldnt call it gossip
[2022-12-07 13:45:58] <uptiltcheese> @vande14y yea but they thought theyd have panda circuit in the bag and they could use alan to strong arm they cant do that now
[2022-12-07 13:46:01] <%n0ne> and then he used that as fuel
[2022-12-07 13:46:12] <+Boggelz> i think if it was possible that Nintendo was taking more control, theres no shot that TOs would easily burn bridges
[2022-12-07 13:46:37] <Ninortwitch> I thin kit's still possible though, SWT was doing good
[2022-12-07 13:46:46] <+gold_dragoon13> is it even possible to unify smash?
[2022-12-07 13:46:48] <Ninortwitch> speaks to how big a blow that is
[2022-12-07 13:46:52] <housefromtn> difficult to get everyone on bored =/= almost everyone unanimously hates you though

[2022-12-07 13:48:05] <+Vande14y> @uptiltcheese even without panda and alan, they can still do it which is scary, I wish theyd just go away
[2022-12-07 13:48:41] <bb010g> sometimes people just wanna be independent
[2022-12-07 13:48:50] <nifaso> VGBC was doing it

[2022-12-07 13:48:59] <+boba_ck> hes a good leader
[2022-12-07 13:49:04] <+boba_ck> hes selfless
[2022-12-07 13:49:07] <meatbrawls> the melee infinity gaunlet, who can gather all the to's
[2022-12-07 13:49:15] <+the_cheat> scar could be the liason
[2022-12-07 13:49:18] <w00j__> as someone who's hosted community wide events involving multiple teams, it was one of the things i hated doing the most, communicating and collaborating with everyone
[2022-12-07 13:49:20] <+boba_ck> whats wrong with that
[2022-12-07 13:49:22] <excaliberssb> lol
[2022-12-07 13:49:22] <+the_cheat> i want that from my president
[2022-12-07 13:49:23] <nifaso> now that there are like 4 events you might be able to do it
[2022-12-07 13:49:26] <meatbrawls> who doesnt

[2022-12-07 13:50:10] <ch0l1n3> would you say smoking or edibles are better?
[2022-12-07 13:50:10] <+thewaffle77> would assume everyone would want the same thing
[2022-12-07 13:50:13] <indigoRICO420> i bet dr alan mains marth

[2022-12-07 13:50:57] <+gold_dragoon13> @indigoRICO420 he was a brawl guy so meta knight or ic probably
[2022-12-07 13:50:59] <+murgatroidsp> Too many people have directly contradictory visions for what the scene should look like
[2022-12-07 13:51:02] <+boba_ck> stream numbers were abysmal
[2022-12-07 13:51:07] <itsIzumi> he mained snake in brawl
[2022-12-07 13:51:14] <jingle_bells_157> oh boi, just waked up. time to watch my favorite marth the crimson blur's stream before i head off to school
[2022-12-07 13:51:17] <nifaso> snake was dope in brawl though
[2022-12-07 13:51:18] <lucas32__> is this vod gonna be u
[2022-12-07 13:51:19] <uptiltcheese> but they werent in positions where they didnt need panda like bts didnt need panda and u see how that went
[2022-12-07 13:51:20] <Vayseth> @indigoRICO420 He was a snake main
[2022-12-07 13:51:21] <lucas32__> up?
[2022-12-07 13:51:38] <+murgatroidsp> 8
[2022-12-07 13:51:40] <+the_cheat> 8
[2022-12-07 13:51:53] <bb010g> it's a request, not a statement
[2022-12-07 13:51:54] <ninedyfive> I mean, hard to believe it tho after all that gaslighting
[2022-12-07 13:52:02] <bb010g> but it could be a true request
[2022-12-07 13:52:04] <+Boggelz> I wish there werent so many strings attached, id be fine with seeing pandas logo all over streams if it didnt have to be on their twitch and heavily moderated
[2022-12-07 13:52:05] <+420mlgegg> we might hit double digits
[2022-12-07 13:52:09] <nifaso> right after he says he doesnt know how he couldve given that impression
[2022-12-07 13:52:16] <+murgatroidsp> Well it’s not exactly taking accountability, but it includes self reflection
[2022-12-07 13:52:39] <bb010g> 9
[2022-12-07 13:52:45] <+murgatroidsp> 9
[2022-12-07 13:52:52] <+Vande14y> I dont know how he's worked on the tour for 4 years and not know shit like the BTS stuff still

[2022-12-07 13:52:58] <Ninortwitch> and loves nintendo too much
[2022-12-07 13:53:10] <%n0ne> using ignorance as scapegoat maybe...
[2022-12-07 13:53:16] <+murgatroidsp> Okay but read the end of that sentence
[2022-12-07 13:53:16] <+boba_ck> what a scrub
[2022-12-07 13:53:16] <Wacklord> 9 what sympathy points
[2022-12-07 13:53:17] <%n0ne> i dont believe it
[2022-12-07 13:53:19] <nifaso> guy is a huge noob with 15 funko pops
[2022-12-07 13:53:23] <uptiltcheese> @n0ne fax
[2022-12-07 13:53:34] <+murgatroidsp> Okay so basically he doesn’t take social cues?
[2022-12-07 13:53:35] <housefromtn> @Wacklord 9 true statements so far
[2022-12-07 13:53:46] <ch0l1n3> that would be insane, I feel like the concept of blackmailing and strong arming is not something difficult to understand, especially for a 'doctor'
[2022-12-07 13:53:47] <ricknad> @nifaso funko wall
[2022-12-07 13:53:51] <Evolving_Monkey> how and why would panda sabotage SWT?
[2022-12-07 13:53:59] <Stayfin> So how is Nintendo going to interact with smash moving forward
[2022-12-07 13:54:03] <lucas32__> LOL
[2022-12-07 13:54:07] <+murgatroidsp> I know, it’s so sad
[2022-12-07 13:54:09] <Zyph73> it wouldn't be 32 pages then
[2022-12-07 13:54:13] <bb010g> @stayfin it'd be great if they could not
[2022-12-07 13:54:14] <nifaso> @Stayfin we wont interact bac
[2022-12-07 13:54:15] <Ninortwitch> he's either being used by nintendo and doesn't know it, or he's a snake and acts like a fool @n0ne
[2022-12-07 13:54:15] <MockRockTwitch> He's not good at communication based on this writing alone, this was his big chance with tons of lead time and it still feels tone deaf. No chance it wasn't happening with TOs.
[2022-12-07 13:54:24] <+LaffsNotLaughs> @stayfin I have the gut feeling they’re just flat out done at this point lol
[2022-12-07 13:54:24] <+murgatroidsp> He should have just deleted everything else
[2022-12-07 13:54:25] <w00j__> he wouldnt get to expose ken chen for the monster that he is
[2022-12-07 13:54:25] <HideInYellow> instead we got swt gambit
[2022-12-07 13:54:27] <housefromtn> we would have been done 4 hours ago then lol
[2022-12-07 13:54:29] <+boba_ck> i have a hard time believing him there
[2022-12-07 13:54:29] <%ribbanya> oh my god there's so much more
[2022-12-07 13:54:37] <jimborojo> It might have been if Ken didn't upset him so much with his yelling

[2022-12-07 13:55:05] <Stayfin> Now they know about streaming stuff will they just look the other way or press the issue
[2022-12-07 13:55:10] <+murgatroidsp> It’s just what he said
[2022-12-07 13:55:10] <+boba_ck> the alternate timeline was way worse

[2022-12-07 13:55:28] <itsIzumi> it is weird that phil was at so many events without hmw
[2022-12-07 13:55:29] <+boba_ck> pretty much anyone that said fuck nintendo on their twitter
[2022-12-07 13:55:30] <+boba_ck> was banned

[2022-12-07 13:55:57] <+murgatroidsp> @thewaffle77 if you couldn’t commentate anymore I would stop watching
[2022-12-07 13:55:59] <itsIzumi> stude was probably just because he commentates p+ if we're being real

[2022-12-07 13:56:21] <Ninortwitch> that's so scummy by nintendo, just shows they don't care about the scene even more, even when they pretend to through panda
[2022-12-07 13:56:23] <+thewaffle77> i only commentate cause yall want me to
[2022-12-07 13:56:24] <nifaso> bro has a worst vision that that dc villan that wanted everyone to be monkeys

[2022-12-07 13:57:01] <+boba_ck> and had to get approved
[2022-12-07 13:57:16] <+murgatroidsp> Who is aaron
[2022-12-07 13:57:17] <+LaffsNotLaughs> Alan wanted to get in bed with Melee Community then stab us in our sleep
[2022-12-07 13:57:24] <+boba_ck> riptide to
[2022-12-07 13:57:24] <+Vande14y> NO SHOT he fucked with another set of DMs
[2022-12-07 13:57:41] <+Vande14y> zamn thats crazy
[2022-12-07 13:57:51] <MightyFalcon> @thewaffle77 you're such a treat to hear on the mic every time. Nothing but love for you my brother
[2022-12-07 13:58:01] <Sushigh0st_> He was busy figuring out how to edit these thats why it took so long
[2022-12-07 13:58:02] <+thewaffle77> <3 @MightyFalcon
[2022-12-07 13:58:03] <itsIzumi> i feel like if waff really got blacklisted, it might've partially been because of hosting rollback rumble
[2022-12-07 13:58:04] <%n0ne> the problem with melee in his eyes is that we're probably baggage. bc theres no way he focuses only on ult without melee community going vocal
[2022-12-07 13:58:06] <itsIzumi> they petty like that
[2022-12-07 13:58:13] <+Xjustified> Aaron is upset about being brought up. He posted about it earlier iirc
[2022-12-07 13:58:14] <%n0ne> das why he disliked
[2022-12-07 13:58:32] <+the_cheat> here's another thing we haven't talked about - the restrictions on the ways in which TOs could spend the money
[2022-12-07 13:58:45] <+boba_ck> yeah this was untouched
[2022-12-07 13:58:47] <+boba_ck> theres so much shit
[2022-12-07 13:58:57] VIEWERS: 422
[2022-12-07 13:59:00] <+LaffsNotLaughs> @n0ne kodorin said that Alan told him he doesn’t believe in Melee. He wanted to use then kill us.
[2022-12-07 13:59:11] <bb010g> at least commentators weren't getting fucked financially here, yeah
[2022-12-07 14:00:04] <+boba_ck> not to mention most of that is fronted by the TO
[2022-12-07 14:00:07] <+boba_ck> then reimbursed
[2022-12-07 14:00:19] <%n0ne> yea aaron is humble
[2022-12-07 14:00:28] <+thewaffle77> aaron is goated
[2022-12-07 14:00:32] <nifaso> its 2 characters

[2022-12-07 14:01:38] <Aaror> @mightyfalcon big moment for Aarons
[2022-12-07 14:01:51] <MightyFalcon> @Aaror Rofl indeed
[2022-12-07 14:01:53] <%n0ne> this shit just damage control
[2022-12-07 14:02:05] <MightyFalcon> the Aaron delegation is listening
[2022-12-07 14:02:11] <+murgatroidsp> Is this significant?
[2022-12-07 14:02:58] VIEWERS: 413
[2022-12-07 14:03:38] <MightyFalcon> The Aaron delegation would like to decree that mang0 is the GOAT but Armada is also pretty fucking sick
[2022-12-07 14:04:02] <+murgatroidsp> Have you conferred with the other aarons
[2022-12-07 14:04:29] <lucas32__> bruh
[2022-12-07 14:04:29] <+greyman6570> How about we put gimr ken Chen and Alan all in a call and we can have a fat conversation
[2022-12-07 14:04:36] <MightyFalcon> Yes! @Aaror and I have pmed each other personally
[2022-12-07 14:04:43] <+murgatroidsp> Okay good

[2022-12-07 14:05:30] <meatbrawls> "and as you noted things can shift a lot and fast!" is a threat
[2022-12-07 14:05:49] <shelby_lamp> Doesn’t this conflict with his point about not getting negative responses about his approach and attitude from TOs?
[2022-12-07 14:05:56] <Sushigh0st_> So how much for panda shares? I’ll buy them all for $50
[2022-12-07 14:06:04] <Ninortwitch> he just kinda said things move fast, so I think maybe he's confirming what Aaron is saying?
[2022-12-07 14:06:10] <Ninortwitch> oh i see
[2022-12-07 14:06:21] <Ninortwitch> Ya i think you're right

[2022-12-07 14:06:30] <itsIzumi> he posted these images to show him being professional

[2022-12-07 14:06:42] <jimborojo> well saying something your employee said to you is murmurs is a little weird
[2022-12-07 14:06:47] <MightyFalcon> The Aaron delegation would also like to remove the right of the letter 'A' from people named Alan. From henceforth Alan will now be known as Lan

[2022-12-07 14:07:50] <Aaror> @murgatroidsp there's a reason the Larry delegation isn't the Alarry delegation anymore

[2022-12-07 14:10:45] <+wahsher> it's so great we have ppl like technicals in the community bc he is already calling Alan "the greatest businessman in smash"
[2022-12-07 14:10:49] <Sushigh0st_> He just incriminates himself then lmao
[2022-12-07 14:10:59] <%n0ne> maybe overall aaron just didnt want his private hms going public

[2022-12-07 14:11:48] <+boba_ck> nothing
[2022-12-07 14:11:51] <MightyFalcon> As an Aaron, I will tell you we like our privacy
[2022-12-07 14:12:07] <+boba_ck> zero substance
[2022-12-07 14:12:21] <+murgatroidsp> He basically presents polite professional emails as evidence that he gets along with TOs
[2022-12-07 14:12:25] <MightyFalcon> Hell, we dont even like people to know our names because people will quote the Key and Peele sketch
[2022-12-07 14:12:29] <Ninortwitch> he just says he was cordial with TO's, which isn't really even a saving grace for him if it's true, so you can skip
[2022-12-07 14:12:36] <Ninortwitch> at least we learned he responds fast
[2022-12-07 14:12:46] <+murgatroidsp> Aaron is a great name

[2022-12-07 14:13:44] <+murgatroidsp> The first thing I think of when I hear aaron is career home run non steroid user leader hank aaron
[2022-12-07 14:13:46] <bb010g> Aaaron
[2022-12-07 14:13:53] <MightyFalcon> why??
[2022-12-07 14:13:56] <Ninortwitch> I think I know what's happening, he is extremely cordial with TO's to get them to sign, and says whatever he needs to @TheCrimsonBlur
[2022-12-07 14:14:08] <Ninortwitch> but it's not true and it bites him in the ass, like with aaron
[2022-12-07 14:14:23] <uptiltcheese> yea but he can say whatever he wants and still axe them
[2022-12-07 14:14:40] <+murgatroidsp> He’s a noob
[2022-12-07 14:14:42] <uptiltcheese> kinda like how nintendo is like we require licenses
[2022-12-07 14:14:48] <%n0ne> and manipulation
[2022-12-07 14:14:51] <%n0ne> with the aaron thing

[2022-12-07 14:15:09] <Wacklord> it prolly started cordial
[2022-12-07 14:15:27] <+murgatroidsp> And he cherishes his partnership with nintendo so he does sneaky things to make sure they’re pleased
[2022-12-07 14:15:28] <+the_cheat> carrot implies stick lmao
[2022-12-07 14:15:35] <MightyFalcon> all of these pms are so easily doctored

[2022-12-07 14:17:46] <MightyFalcon> Was any genesis licensed?
[2022-12-07 14:17:49] <Zeropass> maybe we should create a new melee org..   Federation de Internationale Melee Association  (FIMA)
[2022-12-07 14:17:50] <+murgatroidsp> Which genesis are we on
[2022-12-07 14:17:53] <MightyFalcon> not that i care

[2022-12-07 14:19:12] <+the_cheat> that is THE DAY
[2022-12-07 14:19:14] <+the_cheat> he called us
[2022-12-07 14:19:23] <+the_cheat> and talked a big game about everyone signing on
[2022-12-07 14:19:26] <Ninortwitch> I think he interpreted peoplpe saying that he had the only influence at nintendo as us saying he didn't want us talking with them
[2022-12-07 14:19:37] <+murgatroidsp> When was riptide
[2022-12-07 14:19:41] <+the_cheat> that was not a discussion to get them licensed one day or another

[2022-12-07 14:20:59] <ricknad> i thought it was someone before riptide
[2022-12-07 14:21:00] VIEWERS: 397
[2022-12-07 14:21:06] <ricknad> then riptide decided it was too risky
[2022-12-07 14:21:19] <%n0ne> im connecting the dots. no wonder i did so bad the whole 2nd half of the yr
[2022-12-07 14:21:24] <%n0ne> they were all panda events
[2022-12-07 14:21:32] <itsIzumi> @ricknad you're thinking of mainstage I think
[2022-12-07 14:21:33] <bb010g> @mightyfalcon save a copy to your computer. youtube-dl.

[2022-12-07 14:21:37] <%n0ne> no cup so no matter
[2022-12-07 14:21:37] <uptiltcheese> @n0ne get rekt
[2022-12-07 14:21:39] <itsIzumi> riptide was actually contacted
[2022-12-07 14:21:40] <ocean2c> none was robbed
[2022-12-07 14:21:46] <Wacklord> if Alan doesn't like melee wonder what he would do to p+
[2022-12-07 14:21:46] <housefromtn> @n0ne does that mean mang0 is a panda plant?
[2022-12-07 14:21:52] <+the_cheat> no i mean it was
[2022-12-07 14:21:55] <Ninortwitch> it's about panda cup apparently
[2022-12-07 14:22:00] <Ninortwitch> oh
[2022-12-07 14:22:01] <+the_cheat> but you got it right it was within the perview of the panda cup
[2022-12-07 14:22:03] <MightyFalcon> @bb010g Honestly I will
[2022-12-07 14:22:09] <ocean2c> @housefromtn huh? mangoFudge
[2022-12-07 14:22:09] <Ninortwitch> ah i see
[2022-12-07 14:22:15] <+the_cheat> that was the day of the first bts/panda call
[2022-12-07 14:22:17] <+the_cheat> that i was on
[2022-12-07 14:22:27] <Ninortwitch> like that was their MO you're saying
[2022-12-07 14:22:36] <Ninortwitch> ya blur said that too
[2022-12-07 14:22:37] <Ninortwitch> cause of the dates
[2022-12-07 14:22:57] <lucas32__> clearly nobody reviewed this statement before publishing
[2022-12-07 14:22:57] <+murgatroidsp> Okay so basically he tried to get riptide as part of panda cup

[2022-12-07 14:23:24] <+murgatroidsp> And he’s presenting that as a positive?
[2022-12-07 14:23:29] <%n0ne> if we sue for damages
[2022-12-07 14:23:35] <%n0ne> its technically nintendos money right

[2022-12-07 14:25:54] <+murgatroidsp> One thing I found weird
[2022-12-07 14:25:59] <+the_cheat> never ask a man his salary, a woman her weight, or dr. alan bunney why genesis wasn't on panda cup
[2022-12-07 14:26:13] <+boba_ck> lmao
[2022-12-07 14:26:14] <+murgatroidsp> Why are all the occurrences of “on” highlighted

[2022-12-07 14:26:23] <Ninortwitch> ya i guess his claim is that he's not scared to show that there's not a lot of people who signed, so he doesn't care? Weird claim
[2022-12-07 14:26:40] <Ninortwitch> 10?
[2022-12-07 14:26:43] <+murgatroidsp> You can ask me my salary

[2022-12-07 14:27:53] <%n0ne> why didnt he remove the date
[2022-12-07 14:27:58] <+murgatroidsp> Poor aaron, he doesn’t deserve that
[2022-12-07 14:28:03] <walkerite> thanks for the evidence
[2022-12-07 14:28:06] <ocean2c> i think he doesnt realize none
[2022-12-07 14:28:10] <Ninortwitch> @TheCrimsonBlur i don't think he can chaldk that up to forgetting, he's writing emails about it and shit
[2022-12-07 14:28:11] <Zoap> its hard to keep everything straight
[2022-12-07 14:28:12] <meatbrawls> 12:47am
[2022-12-07 14:28:13] <ocean2c> he just lies by nature
[2022-12-07 14:28:14] <Ninortwitch> and he def cares about it
[2022-12-07 14:28:14] <bb010g> @mightyfalcon ah, it is command line. I'd `pipx run tcd` but that requires pipx to be installed
[2022-12-07 14:28:23] <+gold_dragoon13> the nudge was the message before i think
[2022-12-07 14:28:24] <Pitor4k> this puzzle game is too easy, can you up the difficulty?
[2022-12-07 14:28:37] <+murgatroidsp> Well the lie is when he says it to aaron
[2022-12-07 14:28:37] <Sushigh0st_> Unban hax so he can make an evidence.zip on Alan
[2022-12-07 14:28:38] <Moop35> the innocuous lies make his more bold claims even LESS believable
[2022-12-07 14:28:41] <rKoco> literally asc 0

[2022-12-07 14:29:09] <+murgatroidsp> I think 50 is generous
[2022-12-07 14:29:22] <+murgatroidsp> There were several sentences with multiple lies
[2022-12-07 14:29:32] <+EdwinBudding> I was kinda hoping I'd catch your VOD, I can't believe you're still streaming.
[2022-12-07 14:29:34] <Ninortwitch> loool
[2022-12-07 14:29:34] <+the_cheat> cool man
[2022-12-07 14:29:37] <Hyper_flux> more petty shit
[2022-12-07 14:29:46] <+murgatroidsp> And if you include the notes, that’s a big source of lies
[2022-12-07 14:29:48] <%n0ne> GIGAFAKECHAD
[2022-12-07 14:29:59] <+the_cheat> you know he said having mainstage on the cup was also a big maybe for nintendo ALSO because we say fuck sometimes
[2022-12-07 14:30:00] <uptiltcheese> not waiting for hell to freeze over
[2022-12-07 14:30:05] <warzone222> Just got here whats happening

[2022-12-07 14:30:35] <Ninortwitch> @EdwinBudding honestly, the whole strream is filled with good shit. I'd recommend the VOD, especially in areas of the Doc you're interested about
[2022-12-07 14:30:38] <+EdwinBudding> it is so insane to me that he truly seems to think he was well within his right to be a hall monitor for nintendo because he thought it was for the betterment of the scene. insane
[2022-12-07 14:30:43] <+murgatroidsp> @warzone222 blur has been going over this statement for the last decade
[2022-12-07 14:30:50] <+EdwinBudding> @Ninortwitch I'm gonna rewatch the whole thing later today
[2022-12-07 14:30:52] <+Ewd444> blur you are still awake? I fell asleep to this stream lol

[2022-12-07 14:31:16] <%n0ne> to be nintendo lapdog
[2022-12-07 14:31:16] <paulloween> Will the vod of this be saved?
[2022-12-07 14:31:19] <%n0ne> i suspect
[2022-12-07 14:31:28] <Zeropass> CEO sucked more this year though. tbh
[2022-12-07 14:31:30] <+murgatroidsp> Oh the nintendo part is fun
[2022-12-07 14:31:37] <+Xjustified> True
[2022-12-07 14:31:45] <jingle_bells_157> that's 10!
[2022-12-07 14:31:49] <warzone222> So it’s basically Alam trusts Nintendo and no one else does?
[2022-12-07 14:31:50] <+Xjustified> 10!
[2022-12-07 14:31:51] <+murgatroidsp> That’s 10
[2022-12-07 14:31:53] <bb010g> what was 9?
[2022-12-07 14:31:53] <+Xjustified> Bare minimum!
[2022-12-07 14:32:00] <+murgatroidsp> Congratulations alan

[2022-12-07 14:32:10] <+boba_ck> was*
[2022-12-07 14:32:10] <Sushigh0st_> What are we counting
[2022-12-07 14:32:12] <+EdwinBudding> blur, something u mentioned that stuck with me was the lack of transparency re: the events and what they were specifically given and having the community told 'trust me bro' in public
[2022-12-07 14:32:13] <+the_cheat> the offers got worse though lol, as boback mentioned earlier
[2022-12-07 14:32:13] <%n0ne> someone give him a giftsub
[2022-12-07 14:32:21] <+boba_ck> ltc didnt get that much
[2022-12-07 14:32:22] <+murgatroidsp> CEO has been all downhill since plup went luigi

[2022-12-07 14:32:37] <Ninortwitch> I wanna hear what you have to say about the next part, about nintendo helping out the scene with money or whatever
[2022-12-07 14:32:42] <+Xjustified> CEO

[2022-12-07 14:32:54] <+Xjustified> CEO's Smash stuff is never worth much
[2022-12-07 14:32:54] <Wacklord> wasn't the quality on those tourneys bad
[2022-12-07 14:32:54] <+murgatroidsp> Who won ceo this year
[2022-12-07 14:32:58] <MightyFalcon> @bb010g I just feel like this stream is special, and it should be archived for at minimum historical reference. I probably should message you
[2022-12-07 14:32:58] <+boba_ck> yeah but if we signed on we'd have to give up bts which is a lot of money
[2022-12-07 14:33:03] VIEWERS: 392
[2022-12-07 14:33:06] <+boba_ck> so the money they give us is breaking us even again
[2022-12-07 14:33:10] <+gold_dragoon13> hbox made 75$ at ceo for 5th
[2022-12-07 14:33:12] <%n0ne> well juggleguy had to get treated well bc his bighouses were cancelled
[2022-12-07 14:33:16] <%n0ne> PR at its finest
[2022-12-07 14:33:21] <+boba_ck> also rob worked at panda

[2022-12-07 14:33:44] <+the_cheat> I do not think he did
[2022-12-07 14:33:45] <%n0ne> what its not even a joke
[2022-12-07 14:33:49] <+the_cheat> he was not a major package event
[2022-12-07 14:33:51] <+murgatroidsp> I have no memory of this tournament
[2022-12-07 14:33:53] <+the_cheat> i could be wrong
[2022-12-07 14:34:16] <+EdwinBudding> 90k of the 2 million in sponsorship cut is a joke
[2022-12-07 14:34:20] <Sushigh0st_> Hmmm
[2022-12-07 14:34:23] <+boba_ck> theres no sales split
[2022-12-07 14:34:23] <w00j__> apex?
[2022-12-07 14:34:25] <+EdwinBudding> where was that 2 million going if alan claims he wasnt making money
[2022-12-07 14:34:35] <+boba_ck> they were fixed amounts in the form of logistics help
[2022-12-07 14:34:35] <+Xjustified> So he spent all that shit on the Finale?
[2022-12-07 14:34:38] <+the_cheat> he flew out 60+ employees to CEO
[2022-12-07 14:34:46] <itsIzumi> Smash Factor was big for Ultimate
[2022-12-07 14:34:49] <+JY_Jelly1> Did juggle guy talk to other TOs about everyone’s experiences? My impression is TO ing is a fraternity of some sort
[2022-12-07 14:34:51] <+EdwinBudding> they should ahve been transparent about the revshare
[2022-12-07 14:34:52] <Ninortwitch> that's fucked ya
[2022-12-07 14:34:57] <+EdwinBudding> 90k of 2m is so fucking bad
[2022-12-07 14:35:04] <+EdwinBudding> thats such a joke
[2022-12-07 14:35:04] <+murgatroidsp> What is the appeal of these circuits anyway
[2022-12-07 14:35:04] VIEWERS: 392
[2022-12-07 14:35:05] <ricknad> most of it prolly went to panda cup finale tho i imagine
[2022-12-07 14:35:25] <+boba_ck> this is why we never signed
[2022-12-07 14:35:30] <+boba_ck> huge reason
[2022-12-07 14:35:36] <+boba_ck> not enough 0's
[2022-12-07 14:36:04] <Sushigh0st_> 4.5% cut for the biggest smash tourney?
[2022-12-07 14:36:14] <+murgatroidsp> Did they really bring in $2 million?
[2022-12-07 14:36:23] <Ninortwitch> Panda gets like 96% there I think?
[2022-12-07 14:36:29] <Ninortwitch> ya
[2022-12-07 14:36:47] <+murgatroidsp> For $2 million a
[2022-12-07 14:36:48] <w00j__> amsa couldve gotten a way bigger paycheck for his first supermajor win 😭😭
[2022-12-07 14:36:51] <Ninortwitch> well that;s a little unfair on my end
[2022-12-07 14:36:56] <BlaickRedDragon> so they basically kept all that money or what?

[2022-12-07 14:37:18] <bb010g> they had a controller to fail to make too
[2022-12-07 14:37:22] <%n0ne> yea what happens to all the unaccounted money
[2022-12-07 14:37:27] <Ninortwitch> but that's just big house, they also have goml, but ya it's abysmal
[2022-12-07 14:37:33] <uptiltcheese> 500k at the least
[2022-12-07 14:37:36] <+EdwinBudding> why didnt he just tell them what was on the line if it was 2 fucking million dollars
[2022-12-07 14:37:39] <Moop35> feels like Alan had unrealistic expectations for what he could get out of smash in the short term, then got more forceful when that didnt work out
[2022-12-07 14:37:42] <+EdwinBudding> 90K out of that is an insult
[2022-12-07 14:37:50] <itsIzumi> smash factor was an ult supermajor too :)
[2022-12-07 14:38:01] <+boba_ck> it wasnt part of sales tho
[2022-12-07 14:38:01] <+EdwinBudding> he can't claim to want to make smash 'professional' and 'esports' while sitll acting entitled to the insane cheap cost of operations
[2022-12-07 14:38:01] <+boba_ck> these were fixed amounts
[2022-12-07 14:38:06] <Ninortwitch> Rev Share is based
[2022-12-07 14:38:13] <+Xjustified> Yup
[2022-12-07 14:38:19] <The_SOB_II> what is this document?
[2022-12-07 14:38:22] <BlaickRedDragon> he couldn't have spent all that on just flying his employees...
[2022-12-07 14:38:45] <+murgatroidsp> @the_sob_ii the statement alan put out tonight
[2022-12-07 14:38:47] <Ninortwitch> he's using the money to upgrade his notepad to write more notes
[2022-12-07 14:38:47] <+boba_ck> a lot of it went to production
[2022-12-07 14:38:49] <Ninortwitch> for this doc
[2022-12-07 14:38:49] <+murgatroidsp> Uh
[2022-12-07 14:38:54] <+murgatroidsp> Last night I guess

[2022-12-07 14:39:15] <The_SOB_II> thx @murgatroidsp
[2022-12-07 14:39:16] <Sushigh0st_> he had to pay his student loans
[2022-12-07 14:39:18] <Ninortwitch> ya
[2022-12-07 14:39:20] <Dezbrah> Big house made 2 mil?
[2022-12-07 14:39:27] <w00j__> panda cup sponsor money @dezbrah
[2022-12-07 14:39:32] <Ninortwitch> nah @Dezbrah
[2022-12-07 14:39:51] <housefromtn> is that really 2 mil in sponsor money or is that a fudge and some of that was vc money?
[2022-12-07 14:39:54] <housefromtn> just speculation
[2022-12-07 14:39:55] <bb010g> Do we know whether this is sponsor or VC money?
[2022-12-07 14:39:55] <+EdwinBudding> bro he was paying for production (bless them) that wasn't even particularly super well equipped or incredible at the events they did and constantly overworked
[2022-12-07 14:40:01] <housefromtn> lmao
[2022-12-07 14:40:05] <Zeropass> it feels kind of like when adults tell children not to talk.. Nintendo and Panda consider the melee scene children
[2022-12-07 14:40:05] <housefromtn> @bb010g
[2022-12-07 14:40:13] <Dezbrah> 2 mil sounds sooo large, surely melee cant get that much
[2022-12-07 14:40:18] <Ninortwitch> Alan is a better business man than you because he scams people  @TheCrimsonBlur
[2022-12-07 14:40:38] <nifaso> wouldnt he have just won if he made the prize pot half a mil. what to wouldnt want their event in such a circuit
[2022-12-07 14:40:45] <Ninortwitch> Was it just CEO's melee event, or ult too that they got paid 50k for?
[2022-12-07 14:40:47] <BlaickRedDragon> well he got caught so not sure about that lmao

[2022-12-07 14:41:21] <BlaickRedDragon> lol so true
[2022-12-07 14:41:23] <Sushigh0st_> so true zero
[2022-12-07 14:41:30] <+murgatroidsp> He just needs to find somewhere where he won’t get caught
[2022-12-07 14:41:38] <Ninortwitch> true
[2022-12-07 14:41:39] <Zoap> blur you gonna be buying right?
[2022-12-07 14:41:43] <+EdwinBudding> completely fucking botched
[2022-12-07 14:41:44] <+boba_ck> rts?
[2022-12-07 14:41:45] <housefromtn> I don't buy it
[2022-12-07 14:41:49] <Dezbrah> was there any fuckery regarding the GC controller fund raiser?
[2022-12-07 14:41:57] <+murgatroidsp> Is $2 million a real number
[2022-12-07 14:42:07] <+murgatroidsp> Who were these sponsors
[2022-12-07 14:42:16] <meatbrawls> i think it is
[2022-12-07 14:42:17] <BlaickRedDragon> true he could have lied about that too
[2022-12-07 14:42:22] <+ssbmOblivion> if you mean the kickstarter yeah thats real
[2022-12-07 14:42:25] <+Xjustified> Based on their partners and stuff it sounds like it.
[2022-12-07 14:42:25] <@%^Nightbot> B A S E D
[2022-12-07 14:42:27] <Ninortwitch> ya, they prob had good leverage causenintendo
[2022-12-07 14:42:32] <Ninortwitch> so it's possible
[2022-12-07 14:42:37] <Sushigh0st_> 11?
[2022-12-07 14:42:42] <housefromtn> possible it included vc money?
[2022-12-07 14:42:46] <meatbrawls> i think a united melee scene under nintendo sponsorship is worth stupid money, which is what he was selling them
[2022-12-07 14:42:52] <Ninortwitch> it's fucked eh
[2022-12-07 14:43:05] <BlaickRedDragon> Just wondering but I keep listening :)
[2022-12-07 14:43:05] VIEWERS: 400
[2022-12-07 14:43:06] <w00j__> yeah yall are forgetting nintendo is involved. 2 mil is plausible
[2022-12-07 14:43:16] <MightyFalcon> I know this is completely off topic but can anyone in the know comment on Chillin's current health? Been awhile and I just wanna know how he's doin :3
[2022-12-07 14:43:32] <+murgatroidsp> Yea I’ve been wondering that too
[2022-12-07 14:43:33] <+gold_dragoon13> imagine if alan had been smarter
[2022-12-07 14:43:41] <+Xjustified> Dirty money that would have tainted the future long-term
[2022-12-07 14:43:46] <+murgatroidsp> I check cyrain’s twitter occasionally
[2022-12-07 14:43:52] <+ssbmOblivion> what ive gotten so far was most TOs didnt want to work with Nintendo and Alan really tried to force it out of them. Seems like everyone just loses competitors still cant make a living off this
[2022-12-07 14:44:06] <meatbrawls> its a shame for the people looking to make lots of money, which isnt most of the melee scene i think
[2022-12-07 14:44:13] <+EdwinBudding> is there /any/ shot at a fraction of 2 million in sales/sponsorships happening without Big N/the panda approach?
[2022-12-07 14:44:28] <walkerite> does any of this explain why Nintendo shut down SWT
[2022-12-07 14:44:34] <+Xjustified> 7 hours later and we are nearing the final two sections. Been a wild ride to get here.
[2022-12-07 14:44:38] <Ninortwitch> ya, there are deals already at place
[2022-12-07 14:44:40] <+EdwinBudding> like multiple Papa Johns
[2022-12-07 14:44:45] <housefromtn> @EdwinBudding pretty sure it already has with papa johnny
[2022-12-07 14:44:56] <Sushigh0st_> I wonder how big of an appeal to sponsors it is that melee never dies

[2022-12-07 14:45:24] <andiwaffles> yeah I cant understand that
[2022-12-07 14:45:25] <BlaickRedDragon> he must know about EVO 2013 and all...he can't be that newbie
[2022-12-07 14:45:31] <tillermalone> somehow he doesn't understand the stigma against nintendo
[2022-12-07 14:45:35] <+gold_dragoon13> alan a nintendo bot
[2022-12-07 14:45:37] <+the_cheat> that is just untrue
[2022-12-07 14:45:39] <bb010g> he certainly knows about PM
[2022-12-07 14:45:42] <+EdwinBudding> is papa john's total circuit in the millions? my understanding is it was in the hundreds of thousands in total, but idk
[2022-12-07 14:45:44] <+the_cheat> he wanted to buy everyone!!!!
[2022-12-07 14:45:44] <JoselitoNY> Blur have you met Alan irl? Need to know if he’s socially unaware or not lol

[2022-12-07 14:45:54] <+EdwinBudding> he wanted to LITERALLY own everyone thats such a lie
[2022-12-07 14:46:02] <+the_cheat> yes!!
[2022-12-07 14:46:03] <Ninortwitch> well it's what nintendo wanted, and he speaks for them

[2022-12-07 14:46:10] <bb010g> Please do
[2022-12-07 14:46:11] <+Doomgu> @edwinbudding blur said something earlier in the stream that alluded to it being in the millions but maybe I misinterpreted
[2022-12-07 14:46:14] <+EdwinBudding> even if its not necessarily money for himself, its control over the scene. holy shit dude
[2022-12-07 14:46:18] <+boba_ck> he offered us 350k to buy genesis
[2022-12-07 14:46:22] <w00j__> dhir, boback, wisely all corroborated

[2022-12-07 14:51:33] <housefromtn> could have taken the whole scene out

[2022-12-07 14:51:39] <+the_cheat> and Fourside Fights
[2022-12-07 14:51:41] <meatbrawls> yeah, melee will get there eventually, but not like this
[2022-12-07 14:51:43] <+boba_ck> we'd go underground
[2022-12-07 14:51:43] <Ninortwitch> melee would get CUCKED hard
[2022-12-07 14:51:44] <BlaickRedDragon> GG is goated <3
[2022-12-07 14:51:46] <+boba_ck> 1 week notice super majors
[2022-12-07 14:51:47] <MightyFalcon> 100%
[2022-12-07 14:51:48] <bb010g> we'd be rich in cash but poor in spirit
[2022-12-07 14:51:52] <+boba_ck> flash majors
[2022-12-07 14:51:52] <%n0ne> yea sponsor control
[2022-12-07 14:51:53] <Moop35> thank god SWT took a firm stand, and is continuing to do so. They're brave af
[2022-12-07 14:51:57] <+gold_dragoon13> so this was a net win for the community?
[2022-12-07 14:52:00] <+boba_ck> how sick would that be
[2022-12-07 14:52:03] <ocean2c> you gotta preserve this vod so when the documentary is being made the detailed footage is here
[2022-12-07 14:52:08] <langa_money> he wouldve easily got what he wanted if he just waited too which is so scary to think about
[2022-12-07 14:52:18] <+EdwinBudding> 4.5% of 2 miliion for one of the biggest events of the year is hilariously infuriating
[2022-12-07 14:52:22] <Ninortwitch> ya, but people got fukt in the process, so better to view it as a silver lining more than anything I think @gold_dragoon13
[2022-12-07 14:52:23] <+EdwinBudding> where is this money going bro
[2022-12-07 14:52:29] <Sushigh0st_> Yeah if he starts out giving bighous only 90k on a 2 mil deal imagine how much worse it would get
[2022-12-07 14:52:36] <Stayfin> Is their a way to prevent this from ever happening again
[2022-12-07 14:52:47] <housefromtn> yea don't ever get in bed with nintendo
[2022-12-07 14:52:47] <Ninortwitch> Ya I knew this would annoy you
[2022-12-07 14:53:00] <housefromtn> we literally already knew all of this
[2022-12-07 14:53:01] <+gold_dragoon13> @Ninortwitch that feels like better way to look at it

[2022-12-07 14:53:17] <+boba_ck> someones gonna crack
[2022-12-07 14:53:19] <%n0ne> they had players, controllers, rankings
[2022-12-07 14:53:22] <Sushigh0st_> lffnHmm
[2022-12-07 14:53:22] <meatbrawls> need some kind of election for people that are allowed to talk to nintendo lol
[2022-12-07 14:53:22] <%n0ne> what else
[2022-12-07 14:53:23] <+murgatroidsp> People said that when this first got announced
[2022-12-07 14:53:30] <+EdwinBudding> I hate the entitlement to professional "respect" as he takes advantage of the cheap cost of labor to screw over volunteers/underpaid contributors at large majors
[2022-12-07 14:53:35] <Dezbrah> can we reverse engineer melee similar to how OOT did it
[2022-12-07 14:53:35] <+EdwinBudding> you can't have it both ways
[2022-12-07 14:53:37] <+EdwinBudding> its such BS
[2022-12-07 14:53:41] <MightyFalcon> if we gpnna crack, we better get fuckin PAID
[2022-12-07 14:53:50] <housefromtn> say what you want about reddit, ssbm saw through panda from the beginning
[2022-12-07 14:53:54] <+sgh345y3rfgwg> the 0-2 doesnt decide anything though
[2022-12-07 14:53:58] <Ninortwitch> 0 and 2 er gets to play on transformations
[2022-12-07 14:54:01] <+sgh345y3rfgwg> it's community leaders
[2022-12-07 14:54:04] <+boba_ck> im glad its not a secret war anymore
[2022-12-07 14:54:07] <nifaso> i was team PGShats no one should go months ago so I was suprised when everyone was down to go enthuthiastically right before
[2022-12-07 14:54:07] <+murgatroidsp> People just want to believe that nintendo will change and be supportive
[2022-12-07 14:54:08] <%n0ne> blur
[2022-12-07 14:54:08] <Ninortwitch> i actually don't mind transformations though :P
[2022-12-07 14:54:09] <bb010g> War until the copyright expires
[2022-12-07 14:54:10] <meatbrawls> 0-2r's represent
[2022-12-07 14:54:14] <+sgh345y3rfgwg> yes
[2022-12-07 14:54:15] <+boba_ck> the 0-2 is the blood of the scene
[2022-12-07 14:54:18] <%n0ne> did u see devin nash's video from a few days ago
[2022-12-07 14:54:25] <BlaickRedDragon> that's what happened right, some tourneys aceepted panda's deal, the others did not and it ended up failing
[2022-12-07 14:54:25] <bb010g> so less than 100 years war at least
[2022-12-07 14:54:31] <Moop35> @EdwinBudding yah kinda feels like all he saw was $ signs after seeing the community's hard work
[2022-12-07 14:54:32] <w00j__> i love how i know exactly which clip

[2022-12-07 15:00:19] <Moop35> "easier" meaning "impossible to do otherwise"
[2022-12-07 15:00:19] <%n0ne> UNLESS nintendo re-releases soon (which i think they will to avoid that happening)
[2022-12-07 15:00:33] <+EdwinBudding> "without proper community oversight" aka a TYRANT WHO NOBODY HAS OVERSIGHT OVER

[2022-12-07 15:01:36] <Zeropass> oh I don't see nintendo letting the IP rights to smash lapse
[2022-12-07 15:01:37] <+therealmeme> Has blur talked about Genesis attesting to Ken's character yet? The whole thing about Genesis going with VGBC after verbally agreeing to go with BTS
[2022-12-07 15:01:41] <housefromtn> true in theory, not in practice
[2022-12-07 15:01:45] <+murgatroidsp> Because he’s suggesting that the solution is to partner with nintendo
[2022-12-07 15:02:08] <+murgatroidsp> And that things like the panda cup would solve this
[2022-12-07 15:02:08] <+EdwinBudding> THE COMMUNITY OVERSIGHT HE IS REFERRING TO IS JUST HIM BEING A TYRANT LOL

[2022-12-07 15:03:03] <Sushigh0st_> @n0ne honestly maybe that’s why they give us licenses to run it in the first place, to argue in court they haven’t “abandoned” it

[2022-12-07 15:04:34] <andiwaffles> fuck selling our souls to nintendo
[2022-12-07 15:04:35] <+JY_Jelly1> Honest question, could Panda snaking and SWT cancellation possibly be mutually exclusive? Or can we be certain one caused the other?
[2022-12-07 15:04:37] <+EdwinBudding> bro he says they gave Panda $0 AND out the same mouth says that they do so much for events

[2022-12-07 15:05:29] <+the_cheat> i believe the number was $8k
[2022-12-07 15:05:34] <The_SOB_II> IMO: Nintendo cancelled SWT because the Panda cup existed and they preferred it to SWT because they'd have more influence. They wouldn't have made that decision based on what Panda wanted, it was their own business interests that informed the decision
[2022-12-07 15:05:36] <+boba_ck> we got 8k
[2022-12-07 15:05:37] <mickeyd_hs> also it's pretty unrelated but wtf happened to the panda controller
[2022-12-07 15:05:38] <Ninortwitch> also, panda makes money from them still acuse of the ad money
[2022-12-07 15:05:39] <bb010g> Doesn't this directly contradict the stories about Nintendo support that came out around the PM & Twitch disclosures?
[2022-12-07 15:05:41] <Hyper_flux> lmaooo
[2022-12-07 15:05:41] <Ninortwitch> 2 mil
[2022-12-07 15:05:45] <mickeyd_hs> shit seems so pushed under the rug
[2022-12-07 15:05:45] <elterribledecanal> what's the count refering to? got here late
[2022-12-07 15:05:51] <+gold_dragoon13> also i thought nintendo spent so much money in the smash community
[2022-12-07 15:05:51] <+boba_ck> for security and safety
[2022-12-07 15:05:56] <+the_cheat> yes
[2022-12-07 15:05:58] <tillermalone> @elterribledecanal true sentences
[2022-12-07 15:06:07] <Moop35> this goes back to the whole licensing vs sponsoring thing
[2022-12-07 15:06:09] <The_SOB_II> @gold_dragoon13 sarcasm?
[2022-12-07 15:06:10] <+boba_ck> nintendo cut us checks
[2022-12-07 15:06:12] <+the_cheat> not nothin!!!!!!!!!!!

[2022-12-07 15:06:22] <+boba_ck> yeah then thats when we had the convo of ok will this continue without being on the panda cup
[2022-12-07 15:06:22] <+EdwinBudding> very low
[2022-12-07 15:06:23] <MightyFalcon> 8k rofl
[2022-12-07 15:06:24] <+boba_ck> and they said yeah

[2022-12-07 15:06:30] <+Xjustified> @murgatroidsp To TOs for security
[2022-12-07 15:06:35] <Sushigh0st_> Just enough money so that melee isn’t abandonedware
[2022-12-07 15:06:35] <%n0ne> 8k not bad
[2022-12-07 15:06:42] <%n0ne> 8k is like 16k CAD
[2022-12-07 15:06:48] <The_SOB_II> lol
[2022-12-07 15:06:48] <+boba_ck> for comparison, our security cost almost 20k last year
[2022-12-07 15:06:49] <Ninortwitch> it's just a meme considering it's nintendo
[2022-12-07 15:06:51] <Ninortwitch> 8k

[2022-12-07 15:07:18] <+JY_Jelly1> @the_sob_ii that’s a fair point, essentially if the panda -Nintendo relationship never happened, perhaps smash and Nintendo could live in their own worlds
[2022-12-07 15:07:26] <+boba_ck> and being open to actually helping
[2022-12-07 15:07:29] <+the_cheat> plus 4 non-panda licensed events

[2022-12-07 15:20:37] <Ninortwitch> or youy're cringe
[2022-12-07 15:20:39] <+Xjustified> @The_SOB_II I take offense to this as a games journo lol
[2022-12-07 15:20:40] <bb010g> He never paid himself but contact him about share document
[2022-12-07 15:20:41] <@+PR_Kevin> @n0ne never seen so many phantom hits in my life before ucf. youw ere spittin the truth
[2022-12-07 15:20:41] <+murgatroidsp> That paragraph drove me insane
[2022-12-07 15:20:46] <bb010g> *divestment
[2022-12-07 15:20:47] <Moop35> dont really believe that tbh
[2022-12-07 15:20:51] <w00j__> he still did part time dr stuff right? maybe there
[2022-12-07 15:20:57] <+EdwinBudding> he's a doctor so he makes good money iirc
[2022-12-07 15:21:00] <mickeyd_hs> honestly one of the biggest things I took away was that he thought all the scene cared about was money which is the furthest thing from the truth
[2022-12-07 15:21:03] <+murgatroidsp> Not taking vacation and working weekends is not praiseworthy
[2022-12-07 15:21:19] VIEWERS: 408
[2022-12-07 15:21:20] <nifaso> bro needs to take some responsability for his actions DAMN
[2022-12-07 15:21:24] <+EdwinBudding> i hate that he doesnt accept responsibility or fully own up to his own actions
[2022-12-07 15:21:29] <+420mlgegg> hes just trying to stir up empathy by repeatedly bringing that up
[2022-12-07 15:21:32] <+EdwinBudding> its al im sorry for how/you/ feel etc
[2022-12-07 15:21:35] <+boba_ck> i havent either
[2022-12-07 15:21:35] <+murgatroidsp> Everyone needs vacation
[2022-12-07 15:21:37] <farmerSam_> I have no doubt that Alan got some severe harassment, but I barely saw any targeted at Panda staff
[2022-12-07 15:21:45] <+EdwinBudding> hes not sorry at all he thinks the way he behaved was great and that the scene should have just kowtowed
[2022-12-07 15:21:53] <+boba_ck> yeah wtf is that
[2022-12-07 15:21:59] <+boba_ck> bold ass lie
[2022-12-07 15:22:01] <nifaso> that fucking crypto guy had a better apology since he at least said he fucked up before lying through his teeth
[2022-12-07 15:22:04] <The_SOB_II> he's a CEO, classic CEO mentality @EdwinBudding
[2022-12-07 15:22:05] <DesertSnoopy> ye its not "im sorry how i made you feel" at all. thats rough
[2022-12-07 15:22:21] <+Xjustified> @farmerSam_ I unfortunately saw and still see plenty. It is lessened now, but it was really bad.
[2022-12-07 15:22:24] <Sushigh0st_> @pr_kevin dude puts on tournaments and risks losing hundreds of thousands to spit in the face of Nintendo if that doesn’t make him a community leader what does
[2022-12-07 15:22:25] <Hyper_flux> from what i've seen the community has consistently emphasized not to harass panda staff
[2022-12-07 15:22:32] <+the_cheat> im goin to bed now sleepy bears thanks for letting the people know
[2022-12-07 15:22:50] <MightyFalcon> @the_cheat <3 love you king

[2022-12-07 15:23:14] <%n0ne> the silence from panda/alan was what made shit worse
[2022-12-07 15:23:17] <The_SOB_II> Yeah people were being dicks in Cody's chat when SWT first sent the news
[2022-12-07 15:23:17] <SwarmEngine> Smashers can be such dicks sometimes fr
[2022-12-07 15:23:18] <+murgatroidsp> But those same people probably didn’t read this
[2022-12-07 15:23:19] VIEWERS: 415
[2022-12-07 15:23:36] <farmahorro> yeah to me they took WAY too long to actually start addressing this
[2022-12-07 15:23:39] <%n0ne> he coulda gotten on an said, bear with us, statement coming soon, all the players mightve not resigned
[2022-12-07 15:23:58] <+murgatroidsp> He needed to say something earlier and not through a pr firm
[2022-12-07 15:23:59] <tillermalone> this vod should be available for the people
[2022-12-07 15:24:00] <Ninortwitch> I was here for the 7 hours so Ill skip the summary, gn chat
[2022-12-07 15:24:01] <teamtent> @n0ne ya freal, let people’s minds wander
[2022-12-07 15:24:07] <+murgatroidsp> I learned a lot
[2022-12-07 15:24:07] <%n0ne> alan is the greatest
[2022-12-07 15:24:09] <reclaim_dab> tahnk you blur
[2022-12-07 15:24:10] <MightyFalcon> ty blur
[2022-12-07 15:24:14] <%n0ne> and smash is nothing without him
[2022-12-07 15:24:15] <%n0ne> is what i learned
[2022-12-07 15:24:16] <JuicyJustin> community leader right there
[2022-12-07 15:24:19] <Hyper_flux> the worrisome thing is many people will still believe alan's statement without reading it lmao
[2022-12-07 15:24:27] <JuicyJustin> 7 hour stream for the people
[2022-12-07 15:24:27] <+JesusSmashesPuffs> I fell asleep listening to this, dreamed you switched to slay the spire, and woke up to you still reading
[2022-12-07 15:24:37] <+sarapness> me too
[2022-12-07 15:24:38] <MightyFalcon> i will message your muscles later  to make up for it
[2022-12-07 15:24:40] <+sarapness> east coast
[2022-12-07 15:24:41] <Ninortwitch> 12

[2022-12-07 15:24:42] <+boba_ck> smash only getting stronger after this
[2022-12-07 15:24:42] <elterribledecanal> tl;dr alan did nothing wrong
[2022-12-07 15:24:42] <w00j__> 11
[2022-12-07 15:24:43] <TopHatMatt> 12

[2022-12-07 15:24:49] <+Doomgu> I learned :)
[2022-12-07 15:24:54] <MightyFalcon> 11 tbh
[2022-12-07 15:24:54] <Sushigh0st_> “SWT lied” no evidence
[2022-12-07 15:24:57] <+murgatroidsp> I learned that being a TO is brutal, that alan is a complete noob, and that nintendo sucks
[2022-12-07 15:25:00] <TopHatMatt> 12 out of how many tho
[2022-12-07 15:25:03] <w00j__> this was really enlightening
[2022-12-07 15:25:04] <+sarapness> thank you blur

[2022-12-07 15:25:30] <+murgatroidsp> And I learned that Aaron is cool
[2022-12-07 15:25:36] <+WhiffedPunish> Jesus christ blur youre still live
[2022-12-07 15:25:43] <Sushigh0st_> Alan is cordial in emails :)
[2022-12-07 15:25:55] <mickeyd_hs> less true statements then pages in the document
[2022-12-07 15:26:23] <nifaso> and 3 of theme were in the same page mickey
[2022-12-07 15:26:26] <%n0ne> bad business practice
[2022-12-07 15:26:37] <%n0ne> going corporate gone wrong
[2022-12-07 15:26:40] <MightyFalcon> just listen to blur dude, its simple
[2022-12-07 15:26:47] <+Xjustified> Nah, you have cred in that space
[2022-12-07 15:26:50] <+Xjustified> Valid
[2022-12-07 15:26:51] <+murgatroidsp> I think mostly he’s extremely naive and didn’t bother to understand the community he claimed to be serving
[2022-12-07 15:26:54] <%n0ne> ok pce blur good stuff
[2022-12-07 15:26:59] <%n0ne> i need sleep g2g
