[2022-12-16 11:52:21] <@%pocopicopaully> If anyone is curious, ASMR stands for autonomous sensory meridian response. It is the name for the funny tingles you get when you hear whispers or familiar sounds. Some people don’t get those tingles, and some people do.

[2022-12-16 11:52:39] <%TeiyuTheGoatVT> @pocopicopaully You would at least want to make up for it with a bit more sauce or tomato chunks, right? Or with like several fancy types of cheese. Otherwise it just seems kinda dry.

[2022-12-16 11:54:18] <%TeiyuTheGoatVT> I think the effect of ASMR basically comes from like, auditive intimacy. The sound quality suggests that the sound is close to you. Hence why it can be comforting but also make people really uncomfortable.

[2022-12-16 11:57:25] <@%pocopicopaully> Some people get sleepy from coffee or a calming feeling. It’s all about how the caffeine interacts with certain stuff in your brain chemistry and the way your blood stream carries it.

[2022-12-16 12:05:59] <%TeiyuTheGoatVT> Yeah that's what it feels like. I have such a strong pull to be with people, but the anxiety makes it draining.
[2022-12-16 12:06:05] <$AbyssiusConchoidal> it's more damaging to us to be alone forever.

[2022-12-16 12:08:51] <%TheLastTriceratops> In primary school I was 'uncultured,' I didn't really know much about internet culture like the most popular games and youtubers. So all the other kids would talk about stuff and I couldn't join the conversation because I didn't know what they were talking about
[2022-12-16 12:09:02] <$AbyssiusConchoidal> I'm probably one of the few people who uses the term associate for people.
