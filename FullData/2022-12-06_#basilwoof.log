[2022-12-06 23:38:59] <EvaNoxVTube> im the only one in my household who has not had covid yet, but I am the most at risk since im immunocompromised. I have 4 covid shots, while two of my housemates still have not gotten any shots. I literally have to live in only my bedroom 99% of the time, and one of the reasons is that 6 of the 7 people i live with go and hang out with tons of people constantly.
[2022-12-06 23:39:03] <%Sly_Nyx> @rocketgruntdru You CAN but most places only have one or two providers and its usually picking between bad and bad

[2022-12-06 23:42:43] <%+stravvberriez> My mom was dealing with cancer during the peak of covid and it was so upsetting to see people have blatant disrespect for people who were immunocompromised. Luckily shes in remission but that shit was scary
