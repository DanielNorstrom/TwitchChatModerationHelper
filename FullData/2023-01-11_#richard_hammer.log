[2023-01-11 10:10:42] <%Nanometroid> Convenience is a big deal for cats. If someone's in the john, you should probably have a plan B and C.
[2023-01-11 10:11:00] <%Grimfan> Looks like it was about 2100$ or so, but it was a pretty long term amazon payment plan thing
[2023-01-11 10:11:27] <%Grimfan> They were all feral cats we took in, we rescue them and do trap/spay&neuter/release though
[2023-01-11 10:11:30] <%EpicPumaNess> my cat likes to yell at me until she gets the attention she wants, or when her food is empty, besides that, she sleeps right next to me and is nice to pet while I'm falling asleep

[2023-01-11 10:11:45] <%Grimfan> Anyway if we didn't have them we would probably be constantly scooping boxes and it's tough
[2023-01-11 10:11:49] <ShadowsparksTV> I don't like cats, but they always like me.
[2023-01-11 10:12:04] <%Grimfan> Well not all feral cats can be homed unfortunately
[2023-01-11 10:12:17] <+Morlach> When one of my friends was coming over to feed the cats while we were on vacation. He told me we do not even have cats.
[2023-01-11 10:12:19] <ShadowsparksTV> And I get to play the "when is this thing going to randomly bite/scratch me."
[2023-01-11 10:12:24] <@%MiniKatalyst> cats will always gravitate towards those who ignore them
[2023-01-11 10:12:32] <@%MiniKatalyst> theres proper science to it
[2023-01-11 10:12:42] <%Grimfan> Yea there are feral cat colonies
[2023-01-11 10:13:04] <%Grimfan> So you trap cats and return them to the colony to control the population

[2023-01-11 10:14:23] <%EpicPumaNess> It's never been my decision for my family to get a pet, I just get attached to them and end up taking care of them
[2023-01-11 10:14:23] <ShadowsparksTV> It was a great, terrible piece of shit.
[2023-01-11 10:14:30] <@%MiniKatalyst> last year I had a kitten start to turn up on my back patio, watch the thing grow up for like 5 months, no colar but was healthy AF, put on the town chat to see who owned it and it lives 2 doors up and likes to sneak out
[2023-01-11 10:14:36] <%Fanrogh> I’d want a African grey
[2023-01-11 10:14:37] <+Morlach> At my favorite fishing lake, there is a fish cleaning station to clean your catch you want to eat while yo uare there. A cat colony lives off of that station. You show up with a fish there amd like 20 cats show up
[2023-01-11 10:15:06] <%+nickwtfzorz> we also have gauffins, umbrellas, and a summer conure

[2023-01-11 10:17:04] <@%MiniKatalyst> omg my brothers old partner had a bird, when they broke up, the poor thing died from stress

[2023-01-11 10:18:13] <Kitty49> Cats know when they're about to die, so they'll stop eating/drinking
[2023-01-11 10:18:19] <%EpicPumaNess> my aunts dog has decided I'm an intruder and wants to bark at me everytime I come home, and I gotta tell ya, nothing spikes my blood pressure more than being treated as an intruder in my own home
[2023-01-11 10:18:24] <ShadowsparksTV> That's why I got rid of my macaw. He was getting older and way more restless and noisy. So I sent him over to a friend that had similar birds, and lived in a more isolated place.
[2023-01-11 10:18:27] <%thexLed> like a good ass
[2023-01-11 10:18:36] <%Fanrogh> One of my neighbors has a carpet pisser that will bark for hours if out on a meadow near me with my dog
[2023-01-11 10:18:57] <ShadowsparksTV> I hear donkeys are just bigger dogs.
[2023-01-11 10:19:18] <@%MiniKatalyst> my cat was only 5 months old when mum died, I think the only trauma he got was from the people coming and going

[2023-01-11 10:42:00] <+mockymock1980> ya you might not be able to go to canada I thought they had a law that states if its a drug charge you are banned for life

[2023-01-11 10:44:24] <%MUR1CAJAKE> Its crazy to me that documents from so long ago can justify the outcome of your future way down the road. Even more if its something from when you were a minor
[2023-01-11 10:44:29] <+mockymock1980> so what happened to you? did you have to server anytime?
[2023-01-11 10:44:33] <+Morlach> branded for life, literally
[2023-01-11 10:45:10] <+snakepissdiablo_> literally everyone I hang out with has one
[2023-01-11 10:45:11] <+ShaunEatsFood> Selling party drugs as a minor shouldn't even be a on record thing much less a fucking felony. Keeping the poor poor through the legal system.

[2023-01-11 10:45:41] <%$georgebarca> i am morally superior because i have never been caught by the police for my crimes
[2023-01-11 10:45:43] <%Nanometroid> I wanna say literally every uncle, and half my aunts have various felonies. But they're ancient and sealed/expunged depending.
[2023-01-11 10:46:02] <%MUR1CAJAKE> 100% agree in violent cases and specific instances. But people do change for the better in some cases. Not all.
[2023-01-11 10:46:02] <@^Moobot> Buy things on Amazon and support your favorite Dick! n3f.tv/rhamazon
[2023-01-11 10:46:13] <+Morlach> You should be able to travel to EU at least. Big EU fishing trip
[2023-01-11 10:46:45] <+ShaunEatsFood> Felony system is designed to act as a classist system to suppress people. Its not about righteousness its about intentional oppression.
[2023-01-11 10:47:10] <@%MiniKatalyst> I hung out with someone for a while that was on "the list" because he drunk peed in proximity of a childrens playground at 4am in the city

[2023-01-11 10:47:39] <+mockymock1980> i am so glad I don't do any of those things
[2023-01-11 10:47:47] <+bumblebeef> nothing stops their friends from buying them alcohol tho
[2023-01-11 10:47:57] <%Tsarok> That would mean less money for the alcohol companies though
[2023-01-11 10:48:05] <@%MiniKatalyst> ^
[2023-01-11 10:48:09] <+bumblebeef> a child doesnt have a license to drive tho
[2023-01-11 10:48:10] <+ShaunEatsFood> lmao so true take away the ability to drive but not buy alcohol LUL
[2023-01-11 10:48:12] <+Morlach> nothing is stopping you to drive without a license either
[2023-01-11 10:49:05] <+ShaunEatsFood> Unless you live in NYC or in the downtown area of like half a dozen other cities living without driving is not possible
[2023-01-11 10:49:10] <+mockymock1980> pot is legal by you guys now though isnt it?

[2023-01-11 10:50:04] <%+S1lentSymphony> April 2023. Michigan is setting up an automated system to expunge records. The following convictions are not going to be eligible for automatic expungement:  convictions for "assaultive offenses"; convictions for "serious misdemeanors"; convictions for offenses punishable by 10 or more years imprisonment. So unless you fall into there or worse, it'll eventually expunge your felony
[2023-01-11 10:50:07] <%Nanometroid> MN is going over rec legalization for weed. And doing automatic expungements for possession and such.
[2023-01-11 10:50:14] <%MUR1CAJAKE> @snakepissdiablo_ do you think before you type...
[2023-01-11 10:50:25] <%Fanrogh> For me certain crimes are unforgivable, but most crimes I do agree that do the crime do the time should be the case
[2023-01-11 10:50:52] <%+S1lentSymphony> True enough. Hopefully it's a speedy process
[2023-01-11 10:51:13] <+ShaunEatsFood> I think Felony label should be completely removed, serve jail time, pay fines, that should be the extent.
[2023-01-11 10:51:16] <+mockymock1980> so tell me if you know this. So if it legal over there to smoke pot are people who are felons allowed to? most of the time isnt that part of there terms or some shit

[2023-01-11 10:51:53] <+ChromeViper> to be fair, meth is still given as a prescription LUL
[2023-01-11 10:51:59] <+ShaunEatsFood> If I had a felony I would just keep selling drugs forever, not possible to reform my felony status so might as well make 200k being a dealer.
[2023-01-11 10:52:05] <Little_Lady_Lauren> smoking right now :)
[2023-01-11 10:52:18] <+ChromeViper> lmao

[2023-01-11 10:53:11] <+mockymock1980> I really dont think drug dealers make that kind of money. Most of them will just use the money to supply there own habbit
[2023-01-11 10:53:15] <+ShaunEatsFood> Its so sad Sadge
[2023-01-11 10:53:22] <%+GoJoose> I guess that was the idea, to scare you straight
