[2022-12-29 14:43:10] <passerdile> I really don't see a reason to go for 4k for at least a couple more video card generations. Ultrawide 2k is the shit IMO
[2022-12-29 14:43:14] <DiscoverMax> 8K TVs consume a lot of energy
[2022-12-29 14:43:15] <+RoaringHillock> not sure if it's through already but it's planned to ban 8k tv because they consume too much energy
[2022-12-29 14:43:17] <tritonwang> The EU's New Energy Efficiency Standards Will Lead to an Effective Ban on 8K TVs, With Negative Knock-On Effects. The EU's updated Energy Efficiency Index (EEI) for 8K resolution displays will come into effect on March 1, 2023.

[2022-12-29 14:46:03] <+RoaringHillock> ACKTUALLY  they didn't ban 8k TVs, they banned TVs that consume too much. 8k tv might make a comeback if they are efficient enough one day
[2022-12-29 14:46:06] <psykoki114> isnt that an argument for the bans? like if ZA banned some stuff maybe you wouldnt have such power issues?
