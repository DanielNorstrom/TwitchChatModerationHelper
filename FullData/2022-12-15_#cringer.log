[2022-12-15 17:16:45] <fragsofwar> But I do feel that the so called golden age of strategy games is just nostalgia talking
[2022-12-15 17:16:59] <fragsofwar> If you remember there were lots of clones of other more popular games

[2022-12-15 17:17:47] <isaaco21> @fragsofwar having people trying to rip off every game of a certain type is a sign of a golden age, people try to copy what's successful

[2022-12-15 17:18:29] <+selluf> @fragsofwar I think a lot of genre defining games came out in the 90's which still influence current games
