[2022-12-07 17:32:56] <Th3Mafia> check if they are doing damage to it

[2022-12-07 17:33:00] <+hasturblaster> RIP brandon
[2022-12-07 17:33:02] <+ArchReaper7> @Penaleve there's a tutorial. 30 minutes or less to learn
[2022-12-07 17:33:03] <%BerlinCB> I'm in the same boat, @Penaleve .
[2022-12-07 17:33:08] <L0k0m0tivet> @Penaleve losing is fun and a part of the game thats what makes great stories dont be afraid
[2022-12-07 17:33:10] <Th3Mafia> follow crow to learn
[2022-12-07 17:33:13] <Z_ynthia> Penaleve on a scale from rimworld to certain death?
[2022-12-07 17:33:20] <+ArchReaper7> chat if you are wondering if the learning curve is worth it
[2022-12-07 17:33:20] <+ArchReaper7> IT IS
[2022-12-07 17:33:21] <+Masakhan> The No.1 way to deal with early threats like this is to hide inside your fort
[2022-12-07 17:33:26] <+Masakhan> It will eventually leave
[2022-12-07 17:33:28] <%Ljosapaldr> the solution here is a squad and killing it, instead of the crow getting to 1v1 them all one by one. A more experienced player had dealt with this easy, but it's a bit convulated making a squad.
[2022-12-07 17:33:28] <MisterZero_> losing is fun
[2022-12-07 17:33:29] <%+Niccoli00> "everything was going so well" will be said many times
[2022-12-07 17:33:32] <+ArchReaper7> you haven't told them to
[2022-12-07 17:33:35] <%Ljosapaldr> bigger
[2022-12-07 17:33:35] <%dallasfan315> @hasturblaster loved the show when i was a kid
[2022-12-07 17:33:36] <+ArchReaper7> everyone is minding their own business
[2022-12-07 17:33:38] <Th3Mafia> READ ITS DESCRIPTION
[2022-12-07 17:33:40] <%+Niccoli00> so pause and examine it
[2022-12-07 17:33:42] <MartxelTejedor> Read his description Klean!
[2022-12-07 17:33:46] <gnaeuspompeius_magnus> your dwarves are about to start murdering each other
[2022-12-07 17:33:47] <Lukivah> it doesnt have to be big when you're a dwarf KEKW
[2022-12-07 17:33:48] <Z_ynthia> @Klean noone atks it since u dont ahve hunters with crossbows or a military squad assign to atk
[2022-12-07 17:33:51] <Th3Mafia> pause!!!
[2022-12-07 17:33:52] <+ArchReaper7> if you want it killed, enlist the fort and have them kill it
[2022-12-07 17:33:58] VIEWERS: 887
[2022-12-07 17:34:02] <%+Niccoli00> big enough to have a name
[2022-12-07 17:34:07] <+ChubNasty254> Is it an Edgar Allen Crow?
[2022-12-07 17:34:17] <+IamAskunk> rip fortress
[2022-12-07 17:34:18] <matcorax> check description of crow
[2022-12-07 17:34:21] <Lukivah> @ChubNasty254 NotLikeThis
[2022-12-07 17:34:28] <TheJeek1> More slabs PepeLaugh
[2022-12-07 17:34:35] <%BerlinCB> This just turned into Graveyard Keeper.  jlmRoan
[2022-12-07 17:34:37] <%+Niccoli00> have you engraved any of those slabs?
[2022-12-07 17:34:38] <%Ljosapaldr> Giant animals in this are monstrously sized, but it's mostly so dangerous because you're not fighting it, when it attacks everyone runs and it kills whoever it picks.
[2022-12-07 17:34:39] <+ArchReaper7> also have you assigned a manager yet?
[2022-12-07 17:34:45] <+ArchReaper7> because O to manage work orders is sooooo much easier
[2022-12-07 17:34:46] <Z_ynthia> @Klean ontop u ahve engrave slab
[2022-12-07 17:34:47] <Th3Mafia> 'we going to need a lot more slabs' omg if thats not the tag line for dwarf fortress... i dont know what is
[2022-12-07 17:34:48] <%Ljosapaldr> The only solution is a squad, or a lucky shit from whoever it picks.
[2022-12-07 17:34:48] <+diiatto> klean you can use work orders to make multiples of things
[2022-12-07 17:35:15] <conboss93> winter is coming, less mouths to feed
[2022-12-07 17:35:16] <Th3Mafia> is crow dead?
[2022-12-07 17:35:20] <+ArchReaper7> you gotta get your military trained up
[2022-12-07 17:35:24] <+ArchReaper7> so they can deal with the next invader
[2022-12-07 17:35:25] <+Masakhan> Are you in a savage biome?
[2022-12-07 17:35:29] <Th3Mafia> find the crow
[2022-12-07 17:35:32] <Th3Mafia> read its status
[2022-12-07 17:35:41] <+ArchReaper7> nah giant flying crows can spawn anywhere
[2022-12-07 17:35:45] <%+Niccoli00> @ArchReaper7 this is a run where you learn that lesson
[2022-12-07 17:35:46] <%qbixrube> My very first fort in Steam DF got wiped in the first year by a group of giant lovebirds
[2022-12-07 17:35:48] <%Ljosapaldr> @Klean you can check where the crow is by going to the creature > others tab

[2022-12-07 17:36:06] <Z_ynthia> Masakhan savage biome is a lil more rain of blood and walking corpses LUL
[2022-12-07 17:36:11] <Th3Mafia> @ArchReaper7 anywhere on the edge of the map.
[2022-12-07 17:36:20] <%Ljosapaldr> @Z_ynthia no, that's evil, not savage
[2022-12-07 17:36:20] <+Masakhan> I know
[2022-12-07 17:36:28] <NorthernGambit> LUL
[2022-12-07 17:36:32] <MartxelTejedor> @Klean, this game is about storytelling, enjoy loosing your fortress as it will end one day, enjoy reading descriptions and having images on your head and you will learn
[2022-12-07 17:36:39] <Th3Mafia> FIND CROW > READ STATUS
[2022-12-07 17:36:42] <+ArchReaper7> @Th3Mafia i meant anywhere in the world/biomes lol but yes
[2022-12-07 17:36:52] <Th3Mafia> ^
[2022-12-07 17:36:59] <+ArchReaper7> you can hit U then click 'Other' to jump to the crow(s)
[2022-12-07 17:37:00] <%dallasfan315> brandon is pissed
[2022-12-07 17:37:05] <Lukivah> blood on the wall
[2022-12-07 17:37:05] <%dallasfan315> let's go brandon
[2022-12-07 17:37:05] <+HavokReed> Is the crow killable?
[2022-12-07 17:37:12] <+ArchReaper7> why don't you have your dwarves kill it ?
[2022-12-07 17:37:12] <+zolansa> The crow has become so infamous your dwarves named it, haha.
[2022-12-07 17:37:15] <%Ljosapaldr> You need a squad
[2022-12-07 17:37:16] <+frank652> can you just put up some fishing line to keep it away?
[2022-12-07 17:37:18] <KimorySelkies> Dwarves have a lot of blood in them
[2022-12-07 17:37:19] <matcorax> ist not a cock it is a crow XD
[2022-12-07 17:37:24] <%Ljosapaldr> It will keep killing till you kill it
[2022-12-07 17:37:31] <+IamAskunk> @zolansa lmao
[2022-12-07 17:37:34] <+ArchReaper7> if the crow has a name it's because it's strong enough to have killed a name character in history generation
[2022-12-07 17:37:34] <Th3Mafia> ^
[2022-12-07 17:37:39] <%BerlinCB> The crow has a name now?
[2022-12-07 17:37:41] <%BerlinCB> LUL
[2022-12-07 17:37:45] <%Ljosapaldr> n for nobles, assign militia commander

[2022-12-07 17:37:55] <%+Niccoli00> legendary crow of murder
[2022-12-07 17:37:58] VIEWERS: 897
[2022-12-07 17:38:02] <+ArchReaper7> hit N to assign a commander first
[2022-12-07 17:38:03] <+ArchReaper7> then Q to manage the squad
[2022-12-07 17:38:04] <+Masakhan> If you don't train the hell out of the dwarves first, they are going to die very easily
[2022-12-07 17:38:13] <%Ljosapaldr> are you capslocked?
[2022-12-07 17:38:13] <Z_ynthia> capital N
[2022-12-07 17:38:16] <+ArchReaper7> @Masakhan trial by live combat is the best experience
[2022-12-07 17:38:18] <Th3Mafia> the 'Crow the Kleaned the fortress'
[2022-12-07 17:38:31] <%Ljosapaldr> no uniform
[2022-12-07 17:38:35] <%Ljosapaldr> you have nothing
[2022-12-07 17:38:36] <+ArchReaper7> metal
[2022-12-07 17:38:40] <%Ljosapaldr> then click the dwarf head next to the feather
[2022-12-07 17:38:42] <Z_ynthia> and u want an archer squad for the crow
[2022-12-07 17:38:44] <gnaeuspompeius_magnus> crown on bottom left
[2022-12-07 17:38:45] <+ArchReaper7> they will use metal when you start to get it but it doesn't matter for rn
[2022-12-07 17:38:48] <%Ljosapaldr> and assign 10 random dwarves
[2022-12-07 17:38:52] <+ArchReaper7> then click on the button next to the Feather
[2022-12-07 17:38:55] <+ArchReaper7> and assign everyone
[2022-12-07 17:38:55] <%Ljosapaldr> @Z_ynthia he has nothing
[2022-12-07 17:39:03] <%Ljosapaldr> then click the dwarf head next to the feather
[2022-12-07 17:39:05] <Th3Mafia> @Klean you have to figure out if you are damaging the crow, 'U' to find units
[2022-12-07 17:39:08] <+ArchReaper7> he spawns with copper weapons by default
[2022-12-07 17:39:20] <+ArchReaper7> U to list units, 'Other' to see where the crow is
[2022-12-07 17:39:24] <Z_ynthia> Ljosapaldr should ahve atleast one crossbow and a few bolts with standard embark no?
[2022-12-07 17:39:26] <Th3Mafia> ^
[2022-12-07 17:39:31] <+ArchReaper7> but 'u' not shift-u or capslock-u
[2022-12-07 17:39:37] <%Ljosapaldr> no
[2022-12-07 17:39:43] <%Ljosapaldr> you have to fill the squad
[2022-12-07 17:39:45] <+Rychus1> You can command the squad to kill the crow
[2022-12-07 17:39:46] <+ArchReaper7> no, you have to give them a schedule and/or commands
[2022-12-07 17:39:48] <%Ljosapaldr> and then order them to kill it
[2022-12-07 17:39:52] <Th3Mafia> if they are patrolling yes
[2022-12-07 17:39:54] <+ArchReaper7> they don't auto-kill things
[2022-12-07 17:39:57] <+ArchReaper7> except in defense
[2022-12-07 17:39:58] VIEWERS: 897
[2022-12-07 17:39:59] <%Ljosapaldr> no
[2022-12-07 17:40:02] <%Ljosapaldr> the dwarf head
[2022-12-07 17:40:04] <gnaeuspompeius_magnus> no
[2022-12-07 17:40:06] <%Ljosapaldr> next to the feather
[2022-12-07 17:40:11] <Th3Mafia> im in a panic for him
[2022-12-07 17:40:13] <Th3Mafia> lol
[2022-12-07 17:40:17] <%BerlinCB> I'm getting stressed just watching this game.  I can't imagine how bad it is playing it.  mrland1Wat
[2022-12-07 17:40:17] <%Ljosapaldr> click the dwarf head
[2022-12-07 17:40:17] <%+Niccoli00> The Brass Uncertainty, great name for this squad who is about to die
[2022-12-07 17:40:18] <+Rychus1> Click the little person
[2022-12-07 17:40:23] <+ArchReaper7> yes!
[2022-12-07 17:40:24] <%Ljosapaldr> then fill it withr andoms
[2022-12-07 17:40:27] <+ArchReaper7> now assign all those positions
[2022-12-07 17:40:34] <%Ljosapaldr> assign
[2022-12-07 17:40:47] <Th3Mafia> FIND CROW -> 'U' -> OTHER UNITS
[2022-12-07 17:41:15] <%Ljosapaldr> making emergency squads is critical as a skill for dealing with beasts or the odd monster
[2022-12-07 17:41:23] <Th3Mafia> ok, everyone breath, this is how things are (talkign to self)
[2022-12-07 17:41:24] <%Ljosapaldr> you gotta learn it eventually
[2022-12-07 17:41:25] <Reptar_Halt> Learning how to outfit an army will be nice. That takes time though
[2022-12-07 17:41:29] <%+Niccoli00> @Klean you engrave the slabs at the workstation before you place
[2022-12-07 17:41:31] <%qbixrube> if u get a full squad to dogpile the crow u can probably take it
[2022-12-07 17:41:33] <+Rychus1> You engrave before you place them
[2022-12-07 17:41:33] <%Ljosapaldr> they are engraved in the shop where they are made
[2022-12-07 17:41:35] <+ArchReaper7> everyone's gotta learn their own way
[2022-12-07 17:41:38] <Z_ynthia> in the workshop where u make the slab u can engrave them
[2022-12-07 17:41:38] <Th3Mafia> click on slab -> assign to dead person
[2022-12-07 17:41:41] <+ArchReaper7> DF is about learning, not about winning
[2022-12-07 17:41:46] <%qbixrube> might lose a couple but it will be worth it
[2022-12-07 17:41:54] <%+Niccoli00> yeah, you make blanks, then engrave them to honor the dead
[2022-12-07 17:41:58] VIEWERS: 882
[2022-12-07 17:42:05] <Z_ynthia> but u ahve bodies so coffins are better
[2022-12-07 17:42:12] <Th3Mafia> 'honor the dead' is your goal, in w.e way you can
[2022-12-07 17:42:13] <+ArchReaper7> uhhhhh
[2022-12-07 17:42:20] <%Ljosapaldr> no you're making 10 for the same guy here
[2022-12-07 17:42:20] <%+Niccoli00> lol
[2022-12-07 17:42:27] <%Ljosapaldr> yeah like this

[2022-12-07 17:43:03] <%Ljosapaldr> butcher is automatic anyway
[2022-12-07 17:43:05] <tehruttiger> But won't they leave the corpses to rot without coffins?
[2022-12-07 17:43:05] <Th3Mafia> please please please ........ find the crow .... read its description and such
[2022-12-07 17:43:08] <+claussm_> Psyched to see you playing this. I had it wishlisted for so long I basically forgot about it and almost shit myself when I got the email that it was released lol.
[2022-12-07 17:43:08] <+ArchReaper7> by default, butchering an animal is automatic
[2022-12-07 17:43:17] <+Valknaz> isnt this game like rimworld on steroids
[2022-12-07 17:43:26] <+ArchReaper7> @Valknaz yes
[2022-12-07 17:43:29] <%Ljosapaldr> You gotta learn to use squads for stuff like this
[2022-12-07 17:43:31] <+ArchReaper7> a LOT of steroids
[2022-12-07 17:43:38] <Th3Mafia> and crack
[2022-12-07 17:43:44] <+ArchReaper7> dude just wait for a day or two
[2022-12-07 17:43:47] <NorthernGambit> make one of ur dwarves a marksman when u start out
[2022-12-07 17:43:49] <+ArchReaper7> once he starts getting into minecarts
[2022-12-07 17:43:53] <+ArchReaper7> and water physicss

[2022-12-07 17:44:14] <+ArchReaper7> endgame is automating your fortress with minecarts with an impenetrable fortress and top tier military
[2022-12-07 17:44:15] <%Ljosapaldr> yes
[2022-12-07 17:44:15] <@%SpottedTango> fORGOTTEN mythic beasts

[2022-12-07 17:44:20] <Th3Mafia> sometimes literal dragons appear
[2022-12-07 17:44:20] <RaspberrySmurf> just fought a hellmonster

[2022-12-07 17:44:26] <+djbberko420> forgotten beasts yep
[2022-12-07 17:44:26] <+Rychus1> YEP The circus
[2022-12-07 17:44:28] <ZeroPointGames> it gets insane and there are so many different ways you can make armies, and so many different encounters
[2022-12-07 17:44:29] <+ArchReaper7> dig too deep.... and see what hapepns
[2022-12-07 17:44:30] <+HavokReed> That's more like Terraria
[2022-12-07 17:44:30] <sagadelic> Should throw Klean into a haunted biome after he learns to fight. LUL
[2022-12-07 17:44:30] <RaspberrySmurf> had my top squad on it
[2022-12-07 17:44:36] <%Ljosapaldr> it's almost like doom in that way
[2022-12-07 17:44:38] <+HavokReed> But those games are all based on this anyway
[2022-12-07 17:44:43] <RaspberrySmurf> i'm crusading against the goblins right now
[2022-12-07 17:44:48] <+ArchReaper7> "The Dwarves dug too deep and too greedily..."
[2022-12-07 17:44:49] <Lukivah> how many dwarfs are you going to have at end game? 100? 200?
[2022-12-07 17:44:50] <+Rychus1> Its all about the story you make

[2022-12-07 17:45:27] <sagadelic> @klean A LOT of stuff, big goblin hordes coming to assault you, angry elves, Demons once you reach hell. Or even worst of all, the Forgotten Beasts. It gets wild and fun, losing a fort is a hell of a story.

[2022-12-07 17:46:25] <%Ljosapaldr> @Klean You can send them to raid necromancer towers, they might bring back a book that if they read it, they'll become immortal necromancers too. Shit like that.
[2022-12-07 17:46:26] <%+Niccoli00> a legendary crow, you should go look up it's details in the creatures/other section

[2022-12-07 17:48:12] <MichaelSchullerMusic> I saw a streamer play it. Its fun but the netcode is bad
[2022-12-07 17:48:14] <FlowerWater_> I haven't but it looks very similar to their DS1 arenas
[2022-12-07 17:48:28] <+HavokReed> @qbixrube we should find out!
[2022-12-07 17:48:36] <Moon_Man_Miles> watched someone and the battles look cool, still has netcode oddities but its better
[2022-12-07 17:48:37] <+icampd2woodroom> Its pretty fun so far. 6 player stuff is fun
[2022-12-07 17:49:00] <+ArchReaper7> @qbixrube i have seen 'large' creatures which are a tad bit bigger than one tile. i haven't seen any multi-tile creatures yet tho

[2022-12-07 17:50:19] <+frank652> can you tame it and have a flying mount?
[2022-12-07 17:50:23] <Th3Mafia> has the crow finally gone?
[2022-12-07 17:50:28] <%qbixrube> ah damn, I know it was mentioned in one of the dev vlogs some time ago
[2022-12-07 17:50:34] <%Ljosapaldr> the only multi-tile creature in the game, is wagons. (yes it's a creature lol)
[2022-12-07 17:50:36] <+KlngofGods> How goes it, fellow dwarves.
[2022-12-07 17:50:47] <+ArchReaper7> a few random long term goal options: magma moat. captured/caged forgotten beasts. genocide of the goblins. dig deep for top-tier mats
[2022-12-07 17:50:52] <%+Niccoli00> @Th3Mafia maybe, no one else has died to it recently
[2022-12-07 17:51:03] <+ArchReaper7> @Ljosapaldr wagon is a building technically
[2022-12-07 17:51:03] <Th3Mafia> we are in a panic @KlngofGods

[2022-12-07 17:51:15] <sagadelic> I remember when my best fort fell, we only had a legendary hammer dwarf left who went on to eventually become a master farmer, miner, woodcutter and etc in the years to come as he lived in isolation till a migrant wave showed up about 12 years later. My man singlehandedly slayed a really nasty hydra. LUL
[2022-12-07 17:51:16] <+ArchReaper7> oh i was thinking of the starter wagon not trade wagons nvm
[2022-12-07 17:51:17] <+KlngofGods> You could also make basement storages for raw materials with workshops
[2022-12-07 17:51:18] <Th3Mafia> oh no, one dwarf is angry
[2022-12-07 17:51:22] <%+Niccoli00> if I recall correctly having crafting away from your living quarters as well, because of noise

[2022-12-07 18:03:38] <%+dizzyhippydrake> @dizzyhippydrake lmao sick
[2022-12-07 18:03:46] <+general_armchair> @dizzyhippydrake think rimworld, but older, and more terrifying
[2022-12-07 18:03:49] <%Ljosapaldr> It's only layer 1
[2022-12-07 18:03:49] <+ArchReaper7> @dizzyhippydrake you are the master of a settlement of Dwarves. Build, survive, thrive, do what you want sandbox
[2022-12-07 18:03:52] <Th3Mafia> @dizzyhippydrake its a world sim, the most realistic and sadistic one you've seen
[2022-12-07 18:03:57] <%Ljosapaldr> Worst that can happen is forgotten beast
[2022-12-07 18:03:57] <+LenabonTV> Man used to only watch your EFT stuff but seeing you play kenshi and df two of my favorite games shot you quickly up my list of streamers. Great stuff dude!
[2022-12-07 18:03:57] <%+Niccoli00> @dizzyhippydrake if you are familiar with Rimworld, it's a super ultra simplified idea that came from this game
[2022-12-07 18:04:00] <+jon_pls> Music is very good
[2022-12-07 18:04:01] <NorthernGambit> Oh my, one of my dwarves made a legendary cowbone hatch cover KEKW thank u random mood dwarf

[2022-12-07 18:04:03] <+ArchReaper7> it's like rimworld but multiple z levels and no sci-fi
[2022-12-07 18:04:09] <dauntaun> why are you dwarves angry?
[2022-12-07 18:04:11] <+drath____> i hear you need 140 IQ to even play this game
[2022-12-07 18:04:23] <%driptavius> Are you gonna play this wipe?
[2022-12-07 18:04:24] <+swisscheesed> this soundtrack is the best

[2022-12-07 18:04:34] <+CptRedfish> @ArchReaper7 no scifi but there is dwarf-fi!
[2022-12-07 18:04:40] <%driptavius> Yup that’s why I like you. Klean
[2022-12-07 18:04:40] <%+dizzyhippydrake> @dizzyhippydrake thx for all the info everyone! reminds me a lot of rim
[2022-12-07 18:04:40] <%+Niccoli00> @dauntaun legendary murder crow came and killed around 7 or 8 of them
[2022-12-07 18:04:49] <+ArchReaper7> you can set up logic gates with minecarts
[2022-12-07 18:05:02] <+ArchReaper7> so the possibilities are quite literally endless
[2022-12-07 18:05:05] <Th3Mafia> oh shit, you hit the underground bio dome
[2022-12-07 18:05:06] <%+FatherOwens> no chance its tomorrow right
[2022-12-07 18:05:13] <Th3Mafia> BE CAREFUL
[2022-12-07 18:05:17] <%driptavius> And that’s why you have a good audience that are loyal to you. Not just fans of the game
[2022-12-07 18:05:22] <+ArchReaper7> @Th3Mafia bro he doesn't even pause
[2022-12-07 18:05:26] <+ArchReaper7> clench your cheeks and get ready
[2022-12-07 18:05:35] <%+Niccoli00> @dizzyhippydrake yep, much more complicated but with that a lot more stories to enjoy as your fortresses build up and get wiped out
[2022-12-07 18:05:40] <Th3Mafia> he's doing it hardcore @ArchReaper7
[2022-12-07 18:05:43] <Th3Mafia> lol

[2022-12-07 18:06:12] <+LenabonTV> Hell ya man, classic dwarf fortress had me in a death grip I was addicted. You’ll love this game if you enjoy rimworld. Now that the graphics are modern I think it’s a ton better than it already was
[2022-12-07 18:06:19] <%Ljosapaldr> He didn't finish learning squads, so anything he meets, even just a troll, can quickly be game over here :b
[2022-12-07 18:06:19] <Th3Mafia> oh nice, wall = gooood
[2022-12-07 18:06:24] <Th3Mafia> lock the doors
[2022-12-07 18:06:27] <%+Niccoli00> so many openings into the cavern, should be fun *popcorn*
[2022-12-07 18:06:41] <+ArchReaper7> you won't be able to build a wall diagonally. you have to have horizontal/vertical access
[2022-12-07 18:06:44] <Th3Mafia> ^
[2022-12-07 18:06:59] <+wikidus_> did u buy the soundtrack?
[2022-12-07 18:07:23] <szu_the_snake> Wait what its Out?

[2022-12-07 18:07:42] <ayyyluhmao> Hey, just tuned in. What kind of game is this? Looks sort of like Rimworld
[2022-12-07 18:07:51] <+ArchReaper7> i bought it just to support the devs

[2022-12-07 18:08:18] <%+Niccoli00> @ArchReaper7 yeah, 20 years of free game time, was happy to give them some money
[2022-12-07 18:08:18] <SpiritOfBlaze> @ayyyluhmao Think of this like Rimowrlds older, more complicated brother
[2022-12-07 18:08:19] <+ArchReaper7> look at top left of screen
[2022-12-07 18:08:22] <%Ljosapaldr> it's your settlement

[2022-12-07 18:08:45] <+ArchReaper7> always a good thing
[2022-12-07 18:08:54] <+ArchReaper7> they do their own thing
[2022-12-07 18:08:55] <+HavokReed> sounds like you found someone to join the militia
[2022-12-07 18:09:00] <%Ljosapaldr> Zalísdeduk, Wardmanor, Hamlet
[2022-12-07 18:09:05] <ayyyluhmao> alright, thanks for replies :)
[2022-12-07 18:09:08] <FakeHair> are stairs always 2x2 block?
[2022-12-07 18:09:09] <+ArchReaper7> unfortunately you can't recruit them but they will auto patrol the cave
[2022-12-07 18:09:20] <+ArchReaper7> @FakeHair stairs can be any amount
[2022-12-07 18:09:23] <%Ljosapaldr> He's just gonna walk into the cavern and die, but you'll have some warning and protection
[2022-12-07 18:09:27] <+ArchReaper7> he is just choosing to do 2x2
[2022-12-07 18:09:28] <Th3Mafia> @FakeHair everything is a choice in this game
[2022-12-07 18:09:30] <+ArchReaper7> some do 3x3
[2022-12-07 18:09:39] <%+Niccoli00> @FakeHair no, can be 1x1, but only so many dwarves can pass at a time so larger areas are good for high traffic
[2022-12-07 18:09:47] <FakeHair> Ok, I've just seen like 3 different streams and everyone has been doing 2x2 haha
[2022-12-07 18:09:58] <+ArchReaper7> maybe that's what the tutorial recommends idk
[2022-12-07 18:10:03] VIEWERS: 981

[2022-12-07 18:10:31] <%Ljosapaldr> @Klean To find the crows current position you can always click 'u' and other to see everything on the map you have knowledge of
[2022-12-07 18:10:54] <%Ljosapaldr> no he's the monster hunter
[2022-12-07 18:10:56] <%Ljosapaldr> they'
[2022-12-07 18:11:09] <%Ljosapaldr> they're not here to steal artifacts
[2022-12-07 18:11:15] <%Ljosapaldr> never seen a monster hunter do that
[2022-12-07 18:11:18] <+ArchReaper7> monster hunters are legit. check their equipped items to see what they're decked out with. some have steel weapons or better
