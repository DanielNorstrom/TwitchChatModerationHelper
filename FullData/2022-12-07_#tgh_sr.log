[2022-12-07 13:09:03] <arne501> never enjoy the actual ads, just the idea that a streamer that i like is getting something out of it

[2022-12-07 13:10:46] <%SteVanLe> I do like the comradery of most viewers understanding that ads were kind of pushed on streamers.
[2022-12-07 13:11:24] <$SweetLew_> i’ve been getting ads and i’ve been supportive and all but god damn why can’t twitch add VARIETY to their ads
[2022-12-07 13:11:35] <$SweetLew_> if i get one more papa johns ad i will scream
[2022-12-07 13:11:45] <+qCecil> agree
[2022-12-07 13:11:47] <arne501> oh yea fuck pre roll ads
[2022-12-07 13:11:54] <%noratempe> i've been getting 8 pre-roll ads in a row on some streams recently. it's gotten really out of hand
[2022-12-07 13:11:57] <%mettl3will> I hate preroll ads. sometimes I leave before they finish
[2022-12-07 13:12:03] <w00000000hhh> Papa John’s ads are the worst
[2022-12-07 13:12:03] <+edoipi> I just wish those ads were not so terrible
[2022-12-07 13:12:03] <+fussy_ipsa> yup, made me close twitch tab
[2022-12-07 13:12:03] <%Kappatechy> Twitch will add variety when more advertises offer them ads muhShrug
[2022-12-07 13:12:06] <%Freezerburn4ever> i treat pre-rolls like youtube i just expect it
[2022-12-07 13:12:12] <korpocalypse> wow I thought we meant something to you but evidently you're looking for something new? 😤
[2022-12-07 13:12:17] <%TalenLee> it's especially annoying if I haven't logged in to my twitch, so I open a channel, get three minutes of ads, then oh no I have to sign in and now I get another three minutes of ads
[2022-12-07 13:12:18] <itsZenegos> i don't mind the ads as they are nowadays with streamers playing them manually and telling us there are ad breaks coming up. pre rolls and random ads during gameplay are fucked tho
[2022-12-07 13:12:20] <$SweetLew_> also twitch pre roll ads will now last 30 seconds instead of 10-15 which kills the vibe tbh
[2022-12-07 13:12:24] <+Sylphid88> i got turbo just because of prerolls
[2022-12-07 13:12:26] <JFKraken> @SweetLew_ The algorithm has decided you desire pizza
[2022-12-07 13:12:28] <%0ldmanbiff> that's so true. I hate joining a stream and having to wait through an ad. most the time, I just hop off and watch YouTube or something
