[2023-01-10 10:56:56] <%Risom5> Just her everyday hatred and bigotry :)
[2023-01-10 10:57:00] <%wronggparty> thats a weird reason to not play a game imo
[2023-01-10 10:57:06] <MrLannister> Well the thing is you support her by buying and playing the game
[2023-01-10 10:57:06] <May_CinnamonRolls> Stop hating on Rowling :( just an author

[2023-01-10 10:57:15] <+scorpioz77> She just keeps being transphobic and giving more money to transphobic organisations
[2023-01-10 10:57:24] <%AemenNae> bad discussion to start with no mods here
[2023-01-10 10:57:43] <+captainradiator> she donates so much money to transphobic organisations, money she'll get from the sales
[2023-01-10 10:57:54] <May_CinnamonRolls> some ppl cheered when hagrid actor died. That is messed up guys. Stop discussion pls
[2023-01-10 10:57:55] <%Risom5> Yeah, we need someone here to moderate people who actively defend her, you're right @AemenNae
[2023-01-10 10:57:55] <+VarixGaming> Well people are allowed to have their own opinions no? I don't support it, but she is still allowed to have her own opinions :P

[2023-01-10 10:58:37] <MrLannister> I will personally opt out of viewing any content from the game
[2023-01-10 10:58:41] <%+Omnieboer> she's also very transphobic
[2023-01-10 10:58:46] <Zataraz> Hey, d4ve. Been away for awhile. Is the studio a permanent arrangement now after how much you've been enjoying it?
[2023-01-10 10:58:50] <%DukeSpookenSpoonjuken> How about judge the video game by its quality and not identity politics? :)
[2023-01-10 10:58:52] <May_CinnamonRolls> it is a book for children. Less sexy things the better
[2023-01-10 10:58:53] <%Risom5> @AemenNae People supporting her and people supporting transphobic stuff are 1:1 the same people
[2023-01-10 10:58:57] <zaelot7514> Looking at fantastic beasts it looks like he is
[2023-01-10 10:59:08] <%+BoelSardin> @zaelot7514 i mean those are after construct
[2023-01-10 10:59:26] <Szili96> he was grooming harry for 5 book Kappa
[2023-01-10 10:59:26] <%AemenNae> @Risom5 oh oops, I read your comment wrong my bad
[2023-01-10 10:59:36] <%Risom5> @AemenNae <3
[2023-01-10 10:59:36] <%baterixSF> I never understood this JKR thing. people liked her then hated her. I stopped following that stuff
[2023-01-10 10:59:42] <May_CinnamonRolls> @Szili96 heh?
[2023-01-10 10:59:51] <%Lady_Sonoko> Okay sry, didn't want to start a discussion. Just wanted an info ^^,
[2023-01-10 10:59:52] <+captainradiator> the bottom line is that giving money to anything harry potter is giving money to transphobic organisations
[2023-01-10 11:00:07] <zaelot7514> You could argue there's hints and pieces here and there in the HP books and movies that could be interpreted as him being gay

[2023-01-10 11:00:48] <%+BoelSardin> yeah i mean you should be able to differrate pruduct and person. like kanye is what he is, but i mean his old music is still pretty litt. and him saying what he says doesnt change that
[2023-01-10 11:00:56] <%AemenNae> i miss my hand is a foot Sadge
[2023-01-10 11:01:03] <+scorpioz77> There is also the thing, that there is quite alot of bad things (transphobia, homophobia, racism, atisemetism) in the books itself
[2023-01-10 11:01:11] <$KaSSanova69> dualist ja visst
[2023-01-10 11:01:19] <%DukeSpookenSpoonjuken> @BoelSardin agreed
[2023-01-10 11:01:23] <%Risom5> @baterixSF It's very easy! She wrote GREAT children's books (and we loved her for it), then she turned into a transphobic, human rights hating bigot, who actively donate to anti-LGBT+ orgs (and we dislike her for that, because people deserve to live)
[2023-01-10 11:01:25] <+captainradiator> @May_CinnamonRolls are you joking? JK Rowling donates huge sums of money to transphobic orgs, where do you think the money comes from lol
[2023-01-10 11:01:30] <Szili96> @Sp4zie think about the free exposure the book and movies and whatnot get just because what jk says
[2023-01-10 11:01:30] <May_CinnamonRolls> @scorpioz77 Like in bible
[2023-01-10 11:01:47] <+scorpioz77> @scorpioz77 ye, that one is also not a good books
[2023-01-10 11:01:57] <%+BoelSardin> yeah what i mean is you can still boycott a persons product for what they do, but what im meaning is that just because a person is bad doesnt mean the product automaticly is bad
[2023-01-10 11:02:07] <+VarixGaming> Can't we just drop this subject and focus on more positive things? Spuz is normally positivity incarnate. Don't ruin the mood!

[2023-01-10 11:16:30] <DemolitionGoat> @MrOwlProfessional not to send you to other streamers here but boxbox is someone who constantly pivots. I think it's just something you have to learn all the comps for first, so you see the angles.
