[2023-01-05 16:24:42] <+Quadaddy> I would annul as is. Now you have a 50% chance to hit something, you can hit int or lightning to spells. Right? If you remove int first you lose a chance
[2023-01-05 16:24:46] <Slaymeh> youd just bench flat anyway no?

[2023-01-05 20:50:30] <%tryhardneckbeard> @LordTekkless its probably cause of the poriton size or some shit after purchase.  I do that alot, buy a butt roast and cut it into say 8-10 "steaks" and  viola $1 pork steak
