[2023-01-08 13:41:22] <CrystalCoder> imagine if you had a button to "lock on" to a chase, and so then all the cops in a chase, would all be a different color.  indicating what chase they were a part of on the radar.
[2023-01-08 13:41:54] <@%nmussa> They already can attach to a chase, so they could change the markers based off of that
[2023-01-08 13:42:18] <@%nmussa> The issue then becomes some units break off, VCB, go after interference, etc

[2023-01-08 13:42:27] <@%nmussa> So I'm not sure how useful it'd be
[2023-01-08 13:42:41] <CrystalCoder> SeemsGood yep.  i was thinking they could do it based off of proximity.  that they just have to get close enough to the primary/secondary unit(s).

[2023-01-08 20:18:05] <+Shmoopalopicus> freezing the lane is not pushing it out or letting it get pushed
[2023-01-08 20:18:06] <+ScallyWag_Me> only do necessary hits for last hitting and try keeping at least 1, ideally all enemy 3 caster minions alive

[2023-01-08 20:19:40] <+ScallyWag_Me> if the wave collides on the enemy side of the river it pushes towards your tower automatically but they can freeze
[2023-01-08 20:19:57] <+ScallyWag_Me> then you can force the wave into the enemy tower to reset the waves and set up a freeze on your own
