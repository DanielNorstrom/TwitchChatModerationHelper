[2022-12-18 00:26:03] <+camo_tnt> I mean I guess it doesn't feel like a huge appetite when I've been eating it my whole life lol. One issue I have with being tall is that it takes a lot more work for muscle to begin showing than it does for a shorter person

[2022-12-18 02:09:10] <kwik2x> a mastered cure + regen should give cura when you start needing that, iirc

[2022-12-18 21:22:24] <%Xifihas> That's what Odin does, he insta-kills.
[2022-12-18 21:22:24] <%+kidaver1> thats how Odin works, 1 hit KO
[2022-12-18 21:22:26] <%$shinybif> is odin the ohko or miss one?
[2022-12-18 21:22:31] <%+Rigrot> Zantetsuken typically 1 shots in most FF games
[2022-12-18 21:22:33] <%donn_is_me> Yes.
[2022-12-18 21:22:33] <%$shinybif> yeah ok
[2022-12-18 21:22:36] <Erk_Mcguirk> Odin typically has a chance of auto-kill.

[2022-12-18 21:22:42] <ThundrousBlitz> NO, IT'S MUCH STRONGER.

[2022-12-18 21:23:02] <%DarkShadowRage> it's like that in the OG FF7 as well
[2022-12-18 21:23:06] <HumanBoulderRotiserie> It can be, if you've got the right element match up.
