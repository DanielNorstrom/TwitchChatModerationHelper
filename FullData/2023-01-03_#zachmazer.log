[2023-01-03 00:00:09] <%Solembum__> @iamheatnow do you know homany games he would have to play with people if he gave one

[2023-01-03 00:00:32] <VIEWah> dude was an idiot to gift then expect something.  you gotta come to an agreement before you do something like that
[2023-01-03 00:00:46] <VIEWah> RIPBOZO
[2023-01-03 00:01:07] <%Solembum__> thats like gifting to a girl and expecting her to date you lol
[2023-01-03 00:01:08] <camo2525> there is no obligation to give anything but a thanks unless pre approved, i mean come on
[2023-01-03 00:01:16] <B1LLS0N> @zachmazer do you think this map is viable in comp?

[2023-01-03 00:01:21] <VIEWah> exactly
[2023-01-03 00:01:29] <iamheatnow> @Solembum__  yeah i know that as well but is not often when someone gives u 300, but in that case  i think is better if he did just 1 game and then warned the rest that he will not do more and thats it
[2023-01-03 00:01:49] <camo2525> @iamheatnow but your wrong., live with it
[2023-01-03 00:01:59] <%Solembum__> @iamheatnow how do you know he hasnt already stated that?
[2023-01-03 00:02:28] <iamheatnow> yeah it could be, i mean he is not obligated but
[2023-01-03 00:03:03] <camo2525> he isnt showing any less support for his community by not playing, thats just greed at that point
[2023-01-03 00:03:05] <JqyRqy> $2 wraps from taco bell?
