Sep 15, 2022 Knowledge Article No. The United State Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Meat and Animal Products Regulations prohibit travelers from bringing in fresh, dried, and canned meats, dehydrated soup mixes, and meat products from most foreign countries. If any meat is used in preparing a product, it is prohibited.

[2022-12-31 14:21:49] <%Stricken79> @devilleboi A Tarasque is a dragon with six stubby bear legs, the body of an ox, and the grumpy face of a powerful lion. With its short, fat body, It would almost be cute, until you realize the Tarasque also has a wildly-swinging scorpion tail and thorny turtle shell.

[2022-12-31 15:09:24] <%BizBichou> @devilleboi there's no universal right answer. a lot is based on your other gear as well, so if you're looking for what trinket is the best on a 5min 4-boss fight, sim that, and it'll tell your what's best for you at your current gear.

[2022-12-31 15:09:31] <+TheRealBootyklappin> if you keep getting starsurge/starfall procs and a lot of astral is it best to dump your tier stacks or just keep starfall/starsurging?

[2022-12-31 15:26:40] <Raybomber> I really regret staying engineer for this expansion. I'm engineer and my battle rez can still fail. The item is horrible compared to others. And there's no benefit from other tinker gems.

[2022-12-31 15:29:10] <%Marftulok> The helmet has the advantage that all secondary stats are not split into two. So as evoker I got full mastery for example. Means I can pick the highest value one for me and not have it split.

[2022-12-31 15:30:41] <+Kittsuera> you need to make sure you are using a rank 3 tinker and should prob add in the safety switch
[2022-12-31 15:30:52] <%BizBichou> @Marftulok yeah but for some classes you want to go for the helmet for tier if it's good stats naguuraSmart

[2022-12-31 15:31:48] <+jpwastaken_> making them go immune is sometimes a must though because it can kill the tank in higher tyranical
[2022-12-31 15:32:09] <+jpwastaken_> boss does a lot of damage and making them go immune they also stop doing damage to the tank

[2022-12-31 16:22:38] <whup_nz> Naguura is legit great streamer; she's got a fun personality, but she's got world-class skills, shares her knowledge with humility, is one of the best casters in the world, and gives so much to the community. And continues to inspire the women of Warcraft too. More power to her.

[2022-12-31 16:52:16] <+reduce_reuse_recycle> so i downloaded curseforge and have installed many of the addons you have but some of the addons have multiple components to them .. do you install only the main program or every other component also?
[2022-12-31 16:52:33] <@%Kuroz> depends on the addon
[2022-12-31 16:52:51] <@%Kuroz> handynotes requires the dragonflight plugin for example
[2022-12-31 16:52:53] <+reduce_reuse_recycle> like handnotes for example has 10 other handynotes
[2022-12-31 16:53:19] <+reduce_reuse_recycle> and bigwigs has multiple too with voices and other files
[2022-12-31 16:53:25] <@%Kuroz> you need the current expansion only, unless you want to farm random stuff in older content

[2022-12-31 19:00:58] <+ominaya> Evoker is cool but it has all the things I hate about a class. Too much casting and standing around, floor spells…

[2022-12-31 19:15:39] <Fatality1111> so Boomkin is the new destru in high keys?
[2022-12-31 19:15:40] <+wupixlol> You can skip affliction ramp too in low keys (sort of)
[2022-12-31 19:15:42] <+Spartany25> if u have to manual adff is slowrr

[2022-12-31 19:15:48] <%+asmolbunnyintwitch> whhy is that boomie needs so much ramp? i dont get
[2022-12-31 19:15:48] <%NotLimeThis> demo lock is fine because you do your ramp on the previous pack KEKW
[2022-12-31 19:15:49] <froschoo> affliction is pretty easy to ramp this season
[2022-12-31 19:15:55] <glaki> that's better than evokers they deal shit dmg in any key Kappa

[2022-12-31 19:16:19] <+eluzhun> can you explain how soulflame is used? i see it taken in most specs and i dont see the point other than during the gateway phase i guess to burn another shard?
[2022-12-31 19:16:23] <UnsungCesspool> its because of Waning Twilight requiring a 3rd dot.
[2022-12-31 19:16:24] <UnsungCesspool> imo

[2022-12-31 19:16:44] <%NotLimeThis> @eluzhun that's soulburn, which is a damage gain for Demo only.  Soulfame is the aff aoe when a target dies
[2022-12-31 19:16:46] <+Dimisn> change twin moons to make it like sunfire aoe
[2022-12-31 19:16:46] <+go0mbac> Interesting
[2022-12-31 19:16:50] <+jeffb847> moonkin is awesome

[2022-12-31 19:17:19] <unholyhoit> it's important because of how trash is designed in M+, you NEED burst to live KEKW
[2022-12-31 19:17:25] <+ridomilz> so true,look at BM junter for example

[2022-12-31 19:17:37] <%+keebler187> how long does it take you to ramp ?
[2022-12-31 19:17:38] <%+asmolbunnyintwitch> i see, so ir probably similar to shadowpriest, is not that big ramp, yu need like 5 globals but that's enough for a rogue to destroy the pack xD
[2022-12-31 19:17:42] <machenusen> MM   hunter burst is extreme
[2022-12-31 19:17:44] <tcdziedzic> is this a problem with arcane mages also?
[2022-12-31 19:17:45] <%nevernude1> Yea if you pull 10 mobs in a 15 key,  all the smallies are dead 5 sec in to the pull

[2022-12-31 19:18:24] <%Stricken79> @Spartany25 I actually agree, it is all about players with short attention span and sharp notice of dmg meters and flashy mechanics.
[2022-12-31 19:18:25] <%+Rubbmeaow> shadow priests suffer a lot of the same problem haha
[2022-12-31 19:18:30] <ObiWanKen0bi> @Naguura, why are you wear glasses, isn't you had LASIK surgery?
[2022-12-31 19:18:33] <+Argo257> @Naguura as someone who likes affli-lock it is a pain in the ass
[2022-12-31 19:18:37] <+ridomilz> only
[2022-12-31 19:18:39] <Caolair> so is it spread dots and keep up starfall? like if 5 mobs should i stellar all of them?

[2022-12-31 19:19:33] <shaxxtv> whats your stats like?
[2022-12-31 19:19:41] <machenusen> you always enter eclipse before use cds or?
[2022-12-31 19:19:48] <+Caswa> even when you start spamming starfall your dmg doesnt come instantly - starfall dmg ist over time too
[2022-12-31 19:19:48] <@%Kuroz> try blacklisting under buff @Naguura
[2022-12-31 19:19:52] <%+madhatterui> feels like builds are more tuned around raiding than M+ 2-20
[2022-12-31 19:19:52] <lolwhateverdog> whats the reason to cast wrath at end instead of starfire?
[2022-12-31 19:19:55] <@%Kuroz> for whatever reason it says buff
[2022-12-31 19:19:59] <+silentkillervgc> and still not cast starfire KEKW
[2022-12-31 19:20:04] <rast1k_momei> moonkin is always like this
[2022-12-31 19:20:04] <charliemop> yeah some specs only feel good in raid where you have minutes for your rotation to breathe
[2022-12-31 19:20:09] <@%Kuroz> test it
[2022-12-31 19:20:11] <unholyhoit> wouldn't it be an issue with aggro if you did burst faster than the tank can get aggro? KEKW @Naguura
[2022-12-31 19:20:12] <@%Kuroz> for science
[2022-12-31 19:20:13] <ncorgi> yeah what i meant is no other classes have a binary system like eclipse. its just so dated
[2022-12-31 19:20:16] <+1dirtydangles> relying on orbital strike to apply stellar flare and if on cd need to cast separately
