[2022-12-23 11:21:14] <%Taylor131313> might require a nerf
[2022-12-23 11:21:49] <%Taylor131313> people are speculating there might be a nerf later today so both teams can do this boss post nerf
[2022-12-23 11:22:10] <%JurgenRapp> I don't get that, don't they test it inhouse to see if it is possible before releasing it...
[2022-12-23 11:22:18] <%Taylor131313> the answer is no xdd
[2022-12-23 11:22:32] <%Taylor131313> this time they really missed the mark with the tuning of this boss
[2022-12-23 11:22:34] <%NoName6834> xdd
[2022-12-23 11:22:53] <%Taylor131313> shield nerfed by 50% and adds hp also nerfed by 50% is unheard of

[2022-12-23 11:25:31] <%Taylor131313> they probably didn't want the boss to fall within the first week but also didn't want it to go after christmas, but they failed specttacularly on the second one

[2022-12-23 11:28:19] <%Taylor131313> Liquid said they won't have the facility available after saturday
[2022-12-23 11:28:24] <%Taylor131313> so effectively that ends the race
[2022-12-23 11:28:27] <%JurgenRapp> But it's kinda strange to have a race where you suddenly can't progress
[2022-12-23 11:31:56] <%JurgenRapp> They way it is now it's just Blizzard deciding when the race should end...
[2022-12-23 11:32:09] <%JurgenRapp> broken race is broken
[2022-12-23 11:34:00] <%PneumaWHU> If it's too easy, then NA will always win as they start first
[2022-12-23 11:34:35] <%PneumaWHU> There's many times in a race when the boss looks unkillable then teams find something extra to kill them
[2022-12-23 11:38:56] <%Taylor131313> unless a secret phase happens at 10% it seems to be too much this time
[2022-12-23 11:46:46] <%Swiggyswoo_> Blizz never really cared for rwf, best thing that could happen is they go the tournament realm route lke mdt

The electricity this man generates from perfectly executing his rotation with a 100% uptime is enough to power the whole echo facility. What does Liquid have? Trill? Don't make me laugh.

[2022-12-23 18:43:17] <%Taylor131313> yeah the pull was omega clean, but who knows if it would've been enough without nerf
[2022-12-23 18:43:26] <%MrBladexx> well they did have a 14% pull pre nerf.
[2022-12-23 18:43:26] <%Wardrick7> so the question is how much the nerf even efected it, all depends how big of the time increase it was
[2022-12-23 18:43:36] <%MrBladexx> so now Liquid is gonna whine HUGE
[2022-12-23 18:43:46] <%+evrythingunderthesun> yeah it was an amazing pull 2 battle rezs left over
[2022-12-23 18:43:52] <%Taylor131313> it looked to move much slower, but I haven't checked time

[2022-12-23 18:44:04] <%Wardrick7> echo had 8% pull and it was not even close to being clean
[2022-12-23 18:44:11] <%Taylor131313> Liquid unironically thinks they can win the race against Gingi, a man who has a daily intake of 450 grams of pure lean protein feeding his bulging muscles and 200 billion brain neurons. The electricity this man generates from perfectly executing his rotation with a 100% uptime is enough to power the whole echo facility. What does Liquid have? Trill? Don't make me laugh. I think we all know who wins this.

[2022-12-23 18:45:00] <%Taylor131313> yeah I don't think the storm was even touching them at the end, while they were in in for a long time on their 8% attempt
[2022-12-23 18:45:10] <%Wardrick7> i think they could have killed it without the nerf

[2022-12-23 19:03:20] <%Taylor131313> this race was very different because they wanted 1) the boss to not be killable first week and 2) the boss to be killable before christmas, so they made weird tuning and nerfing decisions for sure

[2022-12-23 19:13:02] <%+Boreall> It's just Echo fanboys, this was a really tainted kill. If Liquid got the kill from the nerfs it would have been just as bad. From the beginning BOTH teams said "Shut the fuck up this is a competition not a war"
[2022-12-23 19:13:04] <%Wardrick7> people talk shit all the time, they are just stupid, liquid did great this tier
[2022-12-23 19:13:08] <%MrBladexx> Max said to people to chill the EFF down. and a nerf could have been to Liquid advantage if done in another time
[2022-12-23 19:13:24] <%+snagprophet> @AnnieFuchsia then people would stop raiding and wait
