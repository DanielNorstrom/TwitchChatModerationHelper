[2022-12-21 18:24:38] <+asmallcrow> Maybe message her about it, politely asking if you did something that offended/pushed her away. Asking in a non agressive way is important
[2022-12-21 18:24:41] <Wenusi> @iampeepohappy No, actually she texted me first a few times. However I tried to hangout with her 2 times and she came up with an excuse.

Honestly you guys need a life lmfao, sitting it a streamers chat all day wont make you feel better and it wont improve your chances of being friends with a streamer, not like you had any to begin with lmfao. you guys are just so pathetic. later Libido
