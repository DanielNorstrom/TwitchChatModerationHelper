[2023-01-10 01:33:19] <%+Frederic2ec> @AwCrap oh so that's why the french section in the !english command is so bad PepeLaugh
[2023-01-10 01:33:24] <%maddyjo15> I could probably get around and I could have basic conversations but thats about it lol
[2023-01-10 01:33:26] <@%AwCrap> Yep 4 years of French here too

[2023-01-10 01:33:50] <@%AwCrap> @Frederic2ec actually I didn't write that, most of that command was outsourced to native speakers who said "hey you can add this"
[2023-01-10 01:34:06] <%maddyjo15> @Frederic2ec, that would be a bad Idea lol

[2023-01-10 01:34:42] <@%AwCrap> Well if you have a suggestion for better phrasing shoot
[2023-01-10 01:34:44] <%maddyjo15> my french teacher told me that I had a good ear where I could get the accent right but that I tended to translate word for word and thats not normally how it works lol
[2023-01-10 01:35:46] <@%AwCrap> Yeah I mean most of these latin based languages come down to loads of grammar rules
[2023-01-10 01:36:26] <%maddyjo15> I can understand more than I can really speak, but if someone talks really really fast I cant catch it usually lol
[2023-01-10 01:38:53] <%+Frederic2ec> @StreamElements I would use "seulement" instead of "uniquement". Seulement is more common and is the literal translation of "only"
[2023-01-10 01:39:31] <%+Frederic2ec> While Uniquement -> Unique -> only one if that make sense
[2023-01-10 01:40:17] <%+Frederic2ec> It's like saying "English uniquely"
