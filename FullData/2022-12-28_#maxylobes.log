[2022-12-28 05:40:19] <RL_Defiance> I can understand that. RE3 isn't really a badly made game. But the RNG makes it very cancerous for speedruns especially. Which is why it gets the shit it gets

[2022-12-28 05:49:07] <im_iLL> might be unpopular opinion, but MGS5 has really good movement as it has lots of ways to move and they're all fluid with one another
[2022-12-28 05:49:39] <e_manh> As far as Mega Man X speedruns go, unless you can get that one perfect frame jump in Boomer Kuwanger's level, you're likely not gonna get a WR.

[2022-12-28 06:01:17] <%gordennnnn> Fallout NV is my favorite
[2022-12-28 06:01:21] <scoobymcdooby5> New Vegas is clear but 3 and 4 are also a good time
[2022-12-28 06:01:28] <+MindbulletsDK> Fallout 2 is imo the best RPG ever made, but it's another game that feels clunky if you didn't grow up with it
[2022-12-28 06:01:38] <BasedOnAir> NV seems to be the fav. I‚Äôll play it after 3
[2022-12-28 06:01:44] <%Healer_BTW> @im_iLL i'm still not convinced 4 was wasn't just a base setting for modders to play with

[2022-12-28 06:02:20] <+GrateMan> There's some things in new Vegas that won't make much sense without playing 1 and 2 but you can probablypick up most of the details.

[2022-12-28 06:02:22] <BasedOnAir> There is fallout tactics after 2

[2022-12-28 06:02:59] <ITZPOKKET> outer worlds was fun!!!!!!!
[2022-12-28 06:03:05] <%Hiyugen> i played NV i feel like it was a better FO4
[2022-12-28 06:03:10] <balkonas1> There was one being made Van Buren which was suppose to be Fallout 3
[2022-12-28 06:03:15] <+bearcat2009> it is like the clunky gameplay of 2 but without the rpg elements
[2022-12-28 06:03:19] <scoobymcdooby5> @notthehallow No lie I actually grinded that when it came out lol
[2022-12-28 06:03:31] <%gordennnnn> I wanted to play 76 but heard terrible things about it so I never did
[2022-12-28 06:03:39] <BasedOnAir> I like how you can solve quests in different ways. You can backstab people etc lol
[2022-12-28 06:03:40] <+GrateMan> Van Buren was where they got a ton of their ideas for NV from
[2022-12-28 06:03:59] <+GrateMan> 76 is ok now but it's not a really deep game. If you like survival games you'll like it.

[2022-12-28 06:04:15] <+GrateMan> At launch it was terrible

[2022-12-28 07:00:20] <scoobymcdooby5> @remersion A guy called jervalib won
[2022-12-28 07:00:33] <scoobymcdooby5> Jervalin*
[2022-12-28 07:00:35] <%+YamaJuugo> well its just that supposedly thats what happened last time too
[2022-12-28 07:00:46] VIEWERS: 811
[2022-12-28 07:00:59] <%+YamaJuugo> however, he was also very experienced in running the game anyways and had the best odds regardless
[2022-12-28 07:01:09] <%+YamaJuugo> well thats what I heard from Dist earlier, but I have no clue myself
[2022-12-28 07:01:22] <scoobymcdooby5> Apparently the consistent prison skip was only shared with jervalin
[2022-12-28 07:01:30] <SputterGhost> His rules encourage scummy tactics. He only prohibited cheats and trainers. He encourages any tactics otherwise to win in his own words
[2022-12-28 07:01:43] <scoobymcdooby5> But to be fair he was so much better than anyone else
[2022-12-28 07:01:51] <%CodyTheGod> there will always be turd blossoms when it comes to prize money no matter the amount (people being scummy)
[2022-12-28 07:02:01] <%+YamaJuugo> @scoobymcdooby5 this is what I heard as well
[2022-12-28 07:02:20] <wintergrimoire> hey maxy been awhile how you been
[2022-12-28 07:02:39] <SputterGhost> Meaning hiding strats to win
[2022-12-28 07:02:39] <scoobymcdooby5> @yamajuugo Yeah he likely would have won regardless but it still should have been shared with community imo
[2022-12-28 07:02:46] VIEWERS: 811
[2022-12-28 07:02:46] <Dolrick> well, i think people just want to win, finding a strat and not sharing it is.... it's up to you, but if you end up wining thank to that strat you didnt share.... you might get your kneecaps poped next time you go outside danS
[2022-12-28 07:02:55] <wintergrimoire> doing og re3 i see

[2022-12-28 07:22:18] <%MissScarletTanager> Funny thing about Gaiden is, it literally has a bug that makes the gas launcher infinite ammo... in the run-away mode. So as soon as you get that, the game is literally a cakewalk if you know about the bug.

[2022-12-28 07:25:07] <+Silverpslm> They should remake 8 dlc
[2022-12-28 07:25:09] <%MissScarletTanager> So you get it *really* early, even before the shotgun potentially

[2022-12-28 07:25:35] <Dolrick> an outbreak remake / remaster would be the best thing they could do imo

[2022-12-28 07:26:03] <daniel_dev> Capcom going to grind them remakes til the last minute
[2022-12-28 07:26:10] <%MissScarletTanager> Especially because they *cannot* make everyone happy with the remakes, it seems. They managed to as far as I've seen with RE1make, but all the other ones have had at least *some* vocal griping.

[2022-12-28 07:30:25] <%MissScarletTanager> I own both Outbreaks, but have still never played them
[2022-12-28 07:30:44] <%MissScarletTanager> I would *love* to do a multiplayer speedrun of it someday though, cause that would be fascinating
[2022-12-28 07:30:49] <+Silverpslm> @bnoz I'm not saying the movie directly, but Alice being a main character in those movies, I'm surprised they haven't tried
[2022-12-28 07:30:50] <%+how2banana> @atherieel real talk. i played 4 on my ps3 when it first came out. knew nothing about the game and never beat it. recently played 5 and it was fucking amazing

[2022-12-28 07:32:07] <%MissScarletTanager> I have my fingers crossed for the Silent Hill stuff. Konami has just shat all over itself game wise for literally a decade or so, but this actually looks alright?
[2022-12-28 07:32:24] <+Ghouldude> MH is my favorite series, but if the game comes out on console first then PC months later, I boycott that release.

[2022-12-28 07:33:52] <bnoz> @Silverpslm you're proposing they create a game, based off a movie, that was based off a game. That's some hilarious meta shit.
[2022-12-28 07:33:57] <%MissScarletTanager> True. It DOES feel somewhat familiar to that one month of SH thing they tried to do years back, when they tried to do a bunch of stuff at once and it all faceplanted (the HD collection, two games, and the movie if I recall)
[2022-12-28 07:34:03] <+Silverpslm> Was Hideo Kojima in charge of the Silent Hill movie that came out sometime ago?

[2022-12-28 08:00:02] <blemishednicely> 3 was my fav overall game, I liked 2's replayability most & 1 (remake esply) was just awesome visuals/really well done

[2022-12-28 10:41:53] <%Klarden> Gaiden without infinite grenades glitch is pretty damn hard, yeah
[2022-12-28 10:42:12] <XionBarzhad> Gaiden, followed behind RE3R Inferno.

[2022-12-28 10:42:57] <%$Cyberdyne_T_800> Tbh, i personally found RE7 on Madhouse way more challenging than this on hard.
[2022-12-28 10:42:58] <catsblazing> re6 is not too hard even on veteran but in inferno is just different
[2022-12-28 10:43:02] <XionBarzhad> RE Village on VOS is fine if you're doing NG+. Fresh VOS run though is nuts.
[2022-12-28 10:43:08] <+brickjones> outbreak is up there for difficulty if you've never played it before
[2022-12-28 10:43:11] <catsblazing> no cope I mean
[2022-12-28 10:43:37] <youstink457> nah RE 5is because of button pressing
[2022-12-28 10:43:38] VIEWERS: 1¬†056
[2022-12-28 10:43:54] <XionBarzhad> Outbreak definitely is a game that is outright nasty if you're not playing online. But then you got to deal with the game lag.
[2022-12-28 10:44:05] <%$Cyberdyne_T_800> Also RE5 on Professional is quite a challenge on new game.
[2022-12-28 10:44:08] <%Klarden> yeah, as far as Normal difficulty casual playthroughs go, I'd rate Zero, CVX and Outbreak as the hardest
[2022-12-28 10:44:13] <%MyelinMan> Do you get rewards for completing no hope on village
[2022-12-28 10:44:14] <@%AnEternalEnigma> @XionBarzhad Yep. I died 466 times doing that
[2022-12-28 10:44:33] <catsblazing> doesn't outbreak have a diff where zombies either don't die or infinite respawn
[2022-12-28 10:44:53] <XionBarzhad> In terms of just the default intended experience, Gaiden or RE0 is definitely the most difficult.
[2022-12-28 10:44:59] <+xeelze> RE4 isn't that easy if it's your first playthrough
[2022-12-28 10:45:14] <Dallou> I havnt even bothered trying village of shadows LUL
[2022-12-28 10:45:15] <%Klarden> also in RE6 it's stupid easy to die, which can be "difficult", but it also has lots of checkpoints
[2022-12-28 10:45:26] <Odd_Dizzy> Code Veronica feels like the difficulty comes from a lot of poor design choices
[2022-12-28 10:45:38] VIEWERS: 1¬†056
[2022-12-28 10:45:46] <+brickjones> i'd go as far as saying no one has recommended gaiden

[2022-12-28 10:46:23] <TabScaltose> @catsblazing pretty sure they regenerate after time on all difficulties
[2022-12-28 10:46:28] <XionBarzhad> Code Veronica is a game you can very easily soft lock yourself.

[2022-12-28 10:46:56] <Lets_Go_Raichu> you know what this game needs? Zombie sharks
[2022-12-28 10:47:07] <baro667> I may give another shot but Code Veronica had so much ringy dialog it made me to drop the game

[2022-12-28 10:48:42] <TabScaltose> Revelations 2 is portrayed well
[2022-12-28 10:48:48] <%Klarden> RE7 has fantastic characters and a really solid story, yeah
[2022-12-28 10:49:09] <%MyelinMan> Louisiana story SeemsGood
[2022-12-28 10:49:15] <%$Cyberdyne_T_800> Rev2 is amazing maxyyLove
[2022-12-28 10:49:15] <%Klarden> Bakers are, by far, among the best and most memorable characters in the franchise
[2022-12-28 10:49:25] <XionBarzhad> RE7's story is great until the boat gets involved.

[2022-12-28 10:50:07] <%+Whitsy_> I love code Veronica. but played it when I was a kid and didn't appreciate why you'd have multiple saves. went into final fight after the character swap with just a knife - no way of going back. devastated
[2022-12-28 10:50:48] <XionBarzhad> Silent Hill gameplay didn't really land its footing till about SH3.
[2022-12-28 10:51:29] <baro667> maybe the remake of Silent Hill 2 will have decent combat mechanics but I don't think Blooper team has ever done a combat mechanic in their games

[2022-12-28 10:52:53] <%Klarden> to be fair to them, they might still do that. but bloober be bloobin, so I won't keep my hopes high
[2022-12-28 10:52:57] <XionBarzhad> Kind of jank and rustic gameplay that was old school Silent Hill worked in its favor back in the day. Kind of can't get away with it these days.
[2022-12-28 10:52:57] <Lets_Go_Raichu> guys, i bring news from the future, Bloopers silent hill is GOTY for combat

[2022-12-28 10:53:46] <sanket_22> is japnese language faster then English?
[2022-12-28 10:54:34] <XionBarzhad> Generally with speedruns, Chinese/Japanese text tends to be faster. But this will vary.
[2022-12-28 10:54:34] <youstink457> what's your favourite RE movie/ t
[2022-12-28 10:54:43] <+shimurai> is chinese faster in some games or is it a more recent bit of knowledge?
[2022-12-28 10:54:43] <%$Cyberdyne_T_800> Also why don't they start with a Silent Hill 1 Remake? maxyyThink
[2022-12-28 10:55:15] <XionBarzhad> @Cyberdyne_T_800 Better to go with the one that is more universally loved.
[2022-12-28 10:55:24] <baro667> Blooper team is actually my favorite dev from my country where I livee in
[2022-12-28 10:55:25] <sanket_22> mine favourite Re movie was Re Vendatta

[2022-12-28 10:56:10] <+shimurai> ah. that makes sense
[2022-12-28 10:56:14] <Odd_Dizzy> Would you say 0 is the most complex RE speedrun with the duel characters and lack of item boxes?

[2022-12-28 10:57:33] <+shimurai> the language thing makes sense cuz it has the kanji and kana. but the pure hanzi nature of chinese does make it (generally) denser

[2022-12-28 11:43:42] <Loumona7> But what if you think that way because you live there ? Like, you could come from a country where bread tastes diff√©rents and you travel and... "why does everything tastes so sweet" ? And you would never know because you don't have taste buds from another country, you're accustomed to it... Not trying to argue, please. Just wondering...

[2022-12-28 11:46:20] <%+GaretFarendan> Fanta is amazing. Just like Mezzo Mix/ Spezi
[2022-12-28 11:46:30] <jack_burtonpce> Fanta used to be better but since the sugar tax a lot of drinks that were pure sugar are now a mix of sugar and sweetener.  Except for Coca Cola.
[2022-12-28 11:46:37] <BuggyRey> I mean... yeah. there's a lot of types of bread. there's bread made out of corn, milk, potato and whatever. but here in my country, at least, there's one kind of bread that is considered "normal everyday bread". Here the everyday bread is a kind of Baggett that is salty
[2022-12-28 11:46:38] <why1do> And now for a basic chemistry of bread, sugar + yeast makes bread rise, then you ‚Äúcook‚Äù the bread to kill the yeast (not all of it dies) giving you a yeasty bread, more sugar lowers the rise time
[2022-12-28 11:46:39] <IraTheCreature> You have family in the UK?

[2022-12-28 12:03:32] <why1do> @driverben should be 10lb or 20lb cases, haven‚Äôt looked at one of those in a while tho
[2022-12-28 12:03:41] <EtherOracle> Won't that bacon go bad quickly? It'll get like stiff and greasy. feenEw

[2022-12-28 12:03:59] <DriverBen> @why1do yeah I don't cook bacon at work anymore, other people do that (thank god). We go through like 10-12 cases of that shit now

[2022-12-28 12:04:28] <IraTheCreature> Burnt bacon is the only way to bacon *ducks and hides*
[2022-12-28 12:04:35] <why1do> @etheroracle cook it just shy of crispy then crisp it in the microwave, also about half of it never made it to the fridge
[2022-12-28 12:04:43] <+Soccer_WHOvian> Have a goodnight @comrade135 :)
[2022-12-28 12:05:06] <BuggyRey> who came up with the creature that opens up the mouth like a flower kind of thing? I feel like I saw that first in blade 2
[2022-12-28 12:05:11] <XionBarzhad> Burnt bacon Bruh
[2022-12-28 12:05:15] <EtherOracle> I like my bacon crispy, but the fat is still chewy. fifiBlank Dunno if that makes me a heathen.
[2022-12-28 12:05:21] <DriverBen> burnt bacon basically falls apart..
[2022-12-28 12:05:24] <alyryk> I too enjoy eating greasy glass
[2022-12-28 12:05:28] <IraTheCreature> I like it actually burnt lol

[2022-12-28 12:05:38] <+Soccer_WHOvian> I don‚Äôt like bacon at all
[2022-12-28 12:05:50] <DriverBen> I don't eat bacon nearly as much as I used to

[2022-12-28 12:06:11] <why1do> @etheroracle I have by accident... (undercooking) had almost raw bacon, it‚Äôs not bad, just slimy
[2022-12-28 12:06:16] <DriverBen> I used to cook bacon like once every 2 weeks or so.
[2022-12-28 12:06:44] <DriverBen> Now I just eat it at work once every week or two and only have like 8 strips total in that time
[2022-12-28 12:06:55] <%+ChefMannie> when ya'll cook bacon do you fry or bake?
[2022-12-28 12:07:15] <DriverBen> I fry my bacon personally, but baked bacon is good too
[2022-12-28 12:07:18] <BuggyRey> fry
[2022-12-28 12:07:23] <+brickjones> i fry but baking is way faster
[2022-12-28 12:07:23] <EtherOracle> fifiBlank Uh, okay.
[2022-12-28 12:07:27] <+Nadim74> bacon is haram FeelsBadMan
[2022-12-28 12:07:27] <why1do> I fry, but baked is great, the cleanup afterward is a pain tho
[2022-12-28 12:07:35] <%+ChefMannie> i bake when making a lot
[2022-12-28 12:07:43] <hobrev> pretty much only way I eat bacon nowadays is if I use the grease for something else, like frying some chicken for example
[2022-12-28 12:07:56] <DriverBen> baking is the best way to do a large amount of it

[2022-12-28 12:08:33] <DriverBen> I work in a kitchen at a pipeline camp, you should see how much bacon people take on a daily basis. There's no way those people don't have health problems
[2022-12-28 12:08:36] <alyryk> working in a cafe and having to bake sheets and sheets of bacon and clean it all up afterwards is hell but baked bacon so good

[2022-12-28 12:14:42] <BuggyRey> village references lots of things
[2022-12-28 12:14:50] <%+ChefMannie> true
[2022-12-28 12:14:52] <alyryk> BSAA has a history of being abused by the rich and powerful
[2022-12-28 12:15:14] <XionBarzhad> Well Revelations 1 delves a lot into BSAA's corruption.
[2022-12-28 12:15:20] <$zetar_fox> They will Revive Wesker "for reasons"
[2022-12-28 12:15:28] <%+ChefMannie> and chris is a boulder punching asshole
[2022-12-28 12:15:30] <alyryk> I do think it's funny that they dropped the entire blue umbrella thread
[2022-12-28 12:16:00] <BuggyRey> the rose ending was weird tho... they basically locked up Chris and his team together

[2022-12-28 12:17:33] <BuggyRey> Do you think RE9 will pick up after the helicopter scene or after the Rose ending?
[2022-12-28 12:17:34] <$zetar_fox> @rnowill I don't think she will even return again in RE
[2022-12-28 12:17:40] <BuggyRey> Oh
[2022-12-28 12:17:41] <unknownabysss> re11
[2022-12-28 12:17:44] <XionBarzhad> Yeah Rose DLC is like 19 years after Village or something isn't it? That's a big time skip
[2022-12-28 12:17:49] <alyryk> I think it'd be very weird to jump almost 20 years in mainline
[2022-12-28 12:17:53] <%Klarden> they will finally make RE with two brothers in far future just like DMC intended

[2022-12-28 12:19:04] <BuggyRey> @xionbarzhad yeah but the ending of village where Rose is going to the grave and paying respects is the same scene of Village's ending

[2022-12-28 12:19:42] <XionBarzhad> A timeskip might be the only way they can really get a new main character involved. Cause every new character they do keeps getting killed or never used again.

[2022-12-28 12:21:47] <furitskin> haven't most the main't cast been exposed/infected with a virus witch means they could be sleeper agents
[2022-12-28 12:21:47] <XionBarzhad> Idk why they wouldn't plan DLC for village when RE7 had like 5
[2022-12-28 12:21:52] <DriverBen> I like the new take on Chris in RE7 and village, so I'm curious how they would do Jill

[2022-12-28 12:22:20] <BuggyRey> if they never intended to make DLC for village then the ending isn't a setup for shadows of rose
[2022-12-28 12:22:22] <XionBarzhad> @ChefMannie Piers, who is dead.
[2022-12-28 12:22:31] <%+ChefMannie> @ChefMannie oh ok
[2022-12-28 12:22:38] <BuggyRey> so they were planning to time skip?
[2022-12-28 12:23:01] <XionBarzhad> They definitely planned something with that ending.
[2022-12-28 12:23:03] <$zetar_fox> it did look like a rushed dlc for village
[2022-12-28 12:23:12] <XionBarzhad> Even with the hint of seeing the guy walking on the road.

[2022-12-28 12:32:37] <BuggyRey> village ng+ is real weak. more than rear and re3r even
[2022-12-28 12:32:38] <+Lord_of_Evils> Yeah, a feature that would change the next playthrough is definitely welcomed.
[2022-12-28 12:32:46] <$zetar_fox> im not**
[2022-12-28 12:32:49] <MistaJ167> I'm surprised u haven't said anything about RE4 Remake having competent Ashley AI lol
[2022-12-28 12:32:50] <Lidawano> @theunsunglegion That was so good. Wasn't a NG+ thing though. Wasn't it from a secret area?
[2022-12-28 12:33:05] <%+Stampede_G> infinite LEMI being the de-facto first NG+ unlock for village is so lame. An infinite pea-shooter

[2022-12-28 12:42:54] <MistaJ167> He gets injured then he does the DMC 5 Vergil I Need More Power
[2022-12-28 12:42:57] <kingorange7> they wont as much as they should

[2022-12-28 12:43:25] <BuggyRey> yeah... maybe just a flashback cutscene for Krauser
[2022-12-28 12:43:28] <blemishednicely> Capcom store used to sell Krauser's combat pants...they were pretty sick, TBH
[2022-12-28 12:43:42] <kingorange7> indeed ya got to have KRAUSER for story telling
[2022-12-28 12:44:03] <e_manh> Maybe they'll keep the 'ballistics' line

[2022-12-28 12:45:18] <alyryk> they made luis even greasier but in a vaguely homoerotic way so I hope the balistics are Leon's

[2022-12-28 13:23:43] <wozzezz> I wonder if Exoprimal started as a Dino Crisis game that got turned into something else during development

[2022-12-28 13:41:51] <Voltlight> @Silverwolf32 have you ever purchased a hot cake..
[2022-12-28 13:42:17] <Eldritch_Potato> I cant wait for the RE survivor remake :)
[2022-12-28 13:42:25] <+boyo25> True
[2022-12-28 13:42:29] <+kookymonstir> If it's another RE3R it's gonna be bad...
[2022-12-28 13:42:32] <Legacyreapers> My dad has been playing RE4 since it came out when I was a kid
[2022-12-28 13:42:32] <turlte1> There is potential for a game we lost touch from outbreak revelations I think at this point for any chance of a reviled game we just have to wait until RE4 r is released and how well it sell

[2022-12-28 13:42:47] <unknownabysss> yeah pretty much
[2022-12-28 13:42:52] <Eldritch_Potato> RE survivor remake will be lit
[2022-12-28 13:42:55] <+baryleaf> re4 goes on sale very often
[2022-12-28 13:42:57] <+boyo25> Dino crisis next üôè
[2022-12-28 13:43:12] <unknownabysss> make some new shit
[2022-12-28 13:43:26] <turlte1> We all know that game is too fun for real re fans to not play or ignored the game is going to do great
[2022-12-28 13:43:28] <+AndyDale93> Do you think they'll remake 5 and 6?
[2022-12-28 13:43:34] <SleepyJam> Dino Crisis yes please Kreygasm
[2022-12-28 13:43:37] <+boyo25> I would like to see Dino crisis remake
[2022-12-28 13:43:37] <Eldritch_Potato> Outbreak was such a good concept
[2022-12-28 13:43:52] <Legacyreapers> Give us a co-op Leon and Chris game
[2022-12-28 13:44:04] <Lidawano> As long as the remakes aren't displacing new games, they're fine
[2022-12-28 13:44:12] <+AndyDale93> Personally I don't think 4,5 and 6 need remakes.
[2022-12-28 13:44:22] <unknownabysss> re9 probably in 2024 so lets hope they make some new shit
[2022-12-28 13:44:26] <turlte1> Outbreak and revelations need some revival at least those series have been left in dirt and not polish
[2022-12-28 13:44:36] VIEWERS: 859
[2022-12-28 13:44:45] <Lidawano> Not if they're being made by a different studio though
[2022-12-28 13:44:54] <+KingDadIII> They feel like money grabs tbh
[2022-12-28 13:44:55] <blemishednicely> we need RETRO-makes, dammit...like The Last of Us on 1980s NES...NOBODY has EVER had the chance to play TLOU in 1980 - it's an UNTAPPED market!!!~
[2022-12-28 13:45:03] <Lidawano> Yeah, that stuff I don't like so much
[2022-12-28 13:45:05] <turlte1> These fights bro
[2022-12-28 13:45:19] <+KingDadIII> re2 remake was the only decent one.
[2022-12-28 13:45:23] <$zetar_fox> We live in an era of remakes
[2022-12-28 13:45:53] <turlte1> Never in my life I would see anyone play survivor but here I am
[2022-12-28 13:45:56] <$zetar_fox> Not to much originals
[2022-12-28 13:46:05] <turlte1> Also that HELP scream
[2022-12-28 13:46:34] <unknownabysss> remakes are to make money

[2022-12-28 13:46:39] <unknownabysss> easy
[2022-12-28 13:46:48] <%+DontAskJeremy> I think most games are to make money.
[2022-12-28 13:46:58] <turlte1> Iconic voice acting re does deliver
[2022-12-28 13:47:03] <blemishednicely> you're name is...Ark the Lad
[2022-12-28 13:47:15] <Legacyreapers> While I do like the remakes, you cant help but wonder what theyd be making instead
[2022-12-28 13:48:04] <unknownabysss> yea but like you said nostalgia sells
[2022-12-28 13:48:08] <blemishednicely> man, even the self-destruct sounds depressed, lol
[2022-12-28 13:48:23] <turlte1> Do you think this or RE 1 has the most standout terrible voice acting @maxylobes
[2022-12-28 13:48:29] <madhatter910> and also allows them to reuse assets for future games
