[2023-01-01 15:48:11] <BitLegions> after Tax prob better to just vendor trade it

[2023-01-01 15:51:03] <Neetokiri> do you have "found in raid" if someone brings the item with them on start? then they could just party up and drop off the loots to tick it as checkmarked

[2023-01-01 15:51:20] <%rotorblock> indeed
[2023-01-01 15:51:22] <BitLegions> one way to tackle it is to make it a auction house and not a market
[2023-01-01 15:51:24] <%aramsham> Legit think BSG "ignores" that kind of obvious shit cause they are prob getting some pay off or some  BS
[2023-01-01 15:51:36] <$TheNilknarf> @neetokiri No I don‚Äôt think that works.
[2023-01-01 15:51:37] <%+Killerwindstorm> some ppl just go in and run stashes just to sell on the flea never actually playing the game  ... that sounds so boring

[2023-01-01 16:26:21] <Newton918> I had 20+ minute queues as scav before I switched server list.. then I started geting under 5 minutes, but 180+ ping, like to Russia or South America
[2023-01-01 16:26:44] <%lisdexan> bugged aswell
[2023-01-01 16:26:48] <JaynisK> @Shublues nah, someone just looted it as he was loading in, had it happen all the time last wipe. Scaving in with a friend, he'd load in before me loot stuff, and sometimes containers he looted would look like that.
[2023-01-01 16:26:57] <schallpunkt> so it takes so long becasue the scav Qs are all full?
[2023-01-01 16:27:05] <%NashEquil> loot = fun

[2023-01-01 17:30:34] <+colemandude> I run around like an idiot, but only because im brand new to the game moon2B
[2023-01-01 17:30:34] <$TheNilknarf> It‚Äôs gotta be a result of the implementation of the binaural audio.
[2023-01-01 17:30:35] <Xiphur> What headphones were you using?
[2023-01-01 17:30:35] <+AcousticDivine> didn't people say the audio is totally screwed up now all ove rthe place
[2023-01-01 17:30:36] <%Hoaggy> NO, I know it's aweful cuz I've walked up on others like that
[2023-01-01 17:30:39] <+Dethmold187> Door didn't open, no footsteps, went straight to your location and was aiming at your feet!?
[2023-01-01 17:30:41] <+NexxOneGaming> probably cheat
[2023-01-01 17:30:41] <outerspacefever> helmet + cough + in that stall blocks a lot of sound i think

[2023-01-01 17:30:45] <%+zacreep> i have notice this wipe sometimes it sounds like left but it is right and sometime forward and back war is mixd up
[2023-01-01 17:30:46] <$TheNilknarf> Causing audio bugs.
[2023-01-01 17:30:46] <%$spicy_jello> either something new with the helmets or being injured
[2023-01-01 17:30:47] <%doofizzdrew> that helmet is known for terribke audio

[2023-01-01 17:30:52] <%TexasMartini> yeah that was sus af plus it looked like his character was aiming only towards the ground and not you
[2023-01-01 17:30:53] <%+LampsTV> @Ratpick45 this wipe is awful, i want pre-steam audio back
[2023-01-01 17:30:53] <%ganjaClause> Fuckery is most definitely a foot
[2023-01-01 17:30:54] <mr_fiendy> This wipe has been terrible unfortunately
[2023-01-01 17:30:57] <BitLegions> Forums are saying Audio is broke
[2023-01-01 17:31:01] <%HaberDasheryTv> That shit been happenin mo frequent
[2023-01-01 17:31:02] <rizzer> I remeber that long ago in one patch most headphones were bugged maybe it's the case
[2023-01-01 17:31:06] <Xiphur> @Sequisha what' headset you wearing in game? i noticed the comtacs register sound better imo.
[2023-01-01 17:31:07] <octavethecat> it is a game of sound whoring

[2023-01-01 17:31:17] <+AcousticDivine> is this game built in Unity
[2023-01-01 17:31:17] <BitLegions> see u in the forums KEKW
[2023-01-01 17:31:18] <$TheNilknarf> @ganjaclause The shit winds are a brewing
[2023-01-01 17:31:19] <%Diztortion> CrazyMax7 wtf are you talking about? you have literally no clue about this game

[2023-01-01 17:31:25] <%$spicy_jello> gotta say ive had zero issues with audio unless im injured
[2023-01-01 17:31:26] <Chum964> audio is so damn important for fights in this game.
[2023-01-01 17:31:28] <%Hoaggy> exactly, cuz there's no hud to show where shots are from
[2023-01-01 17:31:32] <BitLegions> its prob better to not rely on noise
[2023-01-01 17:31:33] <%old_zaweri> Revert audio to like 3 wipes ago, was scuffed but still so much better
[2023-01-01 17:31:37] <%Hoaggy> needs good audio
[2023-01-01 17:31:37] <+NexxOneGaming> audio is fubar - even when youre out of breath you can hear audio bleed from people speaking in the background
[2023-01-01 17:31:37] <$Raeydor> @AcousticDivine unironically yes
[2023-01-01 17:31:40] <JaynisK> @LampsTV Steam Audio was better than pre-Steam Audio though. Veritas proved it. But they got rid of this patch for Oculus Audio. elaHmm

[2023-01-01 17:31:45] <YourLittlePuppy> okay, lets listen carefully
[2023-01-01 17:31:47] <Xiphur> @Sequisha i agree, i had some guy some how silently flank me last night when i was at olg gas. I seen him and then next thing you know he ran up on me
[2023-01-01 17:31:51] <+BrownBear2105> dude the other night tried to tell me that the sound was fucked up because my "Perception skill is so low"....hahahaah, i laughed so hard

[2023-01-01 17:32:27] <CrazyMax7> @Diztortion the only clue i have and need is that this game purpose is to make the game as much as unsufferable as possible, with moronic mechanics and ignoring cheaters
[2023-01-01 17:32:31] <%+LampsTV> why was he looking at your feet?
[2023-01-01 17:32:33] <%minusthedrifter> KEKW
[2023-01-01 17:32:34] <Newton918> if you have binaural audio turned on, turn it off and see if that improves sound and performance.
[2023-01-01 17:32:34] <BitLegions> its not stupid to not rely on noise when noise is broken
[2023-01-01 17:32:35] <%+kaspermourinho> what game will you play when done with tarkov ? @Sequisha
[2023-01-01 17:32:37] <%+willieleee> Why was he shooting though?

[2023-01-01 19:50:14] <SilverWolfHunter> Sound comes from where the source is supposed to come from, for example, if someone is in the room, you hear sound from doors closer to you that lead into that room.

[2023-01-01 19:55:49] <BitLegions> if you making a Vr Game you use occulus audio for RIFT that 1% of steam customers have . in turn fucking over 99% of your customer base for litually brain dead developers

[2023-01-01 19:55:52] <Newton918> so with binaural it has to simulate the position of your ears in game to determine how the sound reaches them..
