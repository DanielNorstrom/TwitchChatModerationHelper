[2022-12-17 13:49:31] <xReadyAimMissx> yeah I'm not sure. like some people can't stream on ANY other platform period because they have a deal with twitch. then there's burke and others who don't and can stream on mobile platforms at the same time, but can't be on youtube at the same time. danHmm
[2022-12-17 13:50:10] <xReadyAimMissx> yeah, super small number.
[2022-12-17 13:50:27] <rain2reign> Often people cant go to other platforms because the audience doesnt move along with them.

[2022-12-17 14:04:25] <%xReadyAimMissx> I think that is people swiping up on the live section. It will play your stream, but not actually have them on your tiktok channel. If they tap or click on it, it will then bring them to the stream or they just swipe up to see the next one.
[2022-12-17 14:04:39] <$iantoxicated> does tiktok save anything similar to VODs for lives?

[2022-12-17 14:15:15] <%mutopian> I find it interesting that folks are looking at streaming on tiktok as it's not a platform I'd normally associate with it - thought it was more aimed at short-form content rather than longer stuff but don't really keep up with social media platforms thesedays

[2022-12-17 14:25:30] <%xReadyAimMissx> @iantoxicated he straight up said really loud to her, "where the f have you been?!" so she answered with, "well my mom died". then he immediatley started ranting at her.

[2022-12-17 14:28:04] <%xReadyAimMissx> The way he asked, in my opinion, warranted her little more personal response. Like he made it seem like it was a big deal she had been mia for awhile.
[2022-12-17 14:28:05] <@%xMiragen> And then he made an apology video where he just spent 10 minutes blaming her some more before promoting his channel
[2022-12-17 14:28:05] <Kalderasch> Sure, you can't make people's problems the theme of the stream.
[2022-12-17 14:28:09] <$iantoxicated> It sucks the air out of the stream sometimes though. And some streamers aren't as equipped or skillful enough to dodge that stuff tactfully

[2022-12-17 14:39:24] <sprqn> @Ruinkind well, I think it depends, it goes both ways (not talking of this specific situation), but there is a social convention that is pretty well known of like "hey how are you?" that does mean unload, and then there is also the possibility to say things like "I've been having a rough time" and not unloading, but social situations in general require skill...

[2022-12-17 14:42:04] <Ruinkind> Oh definitely, but also you can read the situation from the other side, and not make it about you.  Try your best to take it on the chin if you think it means that much to them, sure you could just not care and tell them that.  I guess I value their feelings a bit more then general, you usually don't hear someones life story because they don't value your opinion.  @sprqn

[2022-12-17 17:18:18] <CS_Hague> @itssalsashark Yeah, I made a mistake. I'm not sure why I got the impression that it was North Korean. Not sure how that's "racist" though. They literally border eachother and have scientific and military alliances
[2022-12-17 17:18:49] <%TheJingerbeard> usually I put 2 workshops in when building up a sector then remove one when it's mostly full
[2022-12-17 17:19:23] <%itssalsashark> @CS_Hague A mistake is totally fine. By that logic, however, I congratulate the Mexican Space Program for landing on the moon :)
