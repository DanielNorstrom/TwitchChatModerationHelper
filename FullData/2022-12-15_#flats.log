[2022-12-15 18:42:45] <thesaintsronin> I feel like a lot of characters need changes to fit 5v5

[2022-12-15 18:42:52] <+NaderzKill> hanzo needs a gun
[2022-12-15 18:42:52] <%+Soulintheshadow> Lol I remember
[2022-12-15 18:42:52] <bathoz1> Scatter arrow went out before mercy damage buff was really realised. Imagine 580 damage one shots every 10s.
[2022-12-15 18:42:54] <%$TankMittens> lemme just tap this orisa feet
[2022-12-15 18:42:57] <+ShelVero> we do not need scatter arrow back...

[2022-12-15 18:42:58] <%TankBuster3000> As a Hanzo main sice 2016 i loved scatter arrow Kappa
[2022-12-15 18:42:59] <%$Silas_Mann> One shot OMEGALUL RISA
[2022-12-15 18:43:03] <VainDash> I remember hanzo being able to 1 shot hog with the scatter arrow
[2022-12-15 18:43:04] <%rabidraider19> felt like they tracked
[2022-12-15 18:43:06] <TerribleTimmy2> Discord scatter instantly deleting any tank
[2022-12-15 18:43:07] <Jwormy> Hanzo old Scattahhhh. Shoot spawn door, get 4 kills lol
[2022-12-15 18:43:11] <%+djgraymtg> Scatter Arrow was like what if widow was also junkrat

[2022-12-15 18:45:45] <%+kazenblade29> I like hanzo only for his sonic arrow I like knowing where the team is at
[2022-12-15 18:45:46] <robbo_155> Junker queen is the funnest tank to play imo
[2022-12-15 18:45:47] <Hamptonite> Turns out most character's weakness is a shotgun to the face
[2022-12-15 18:45:51] <VII_ow> she should just throw the axe
[2022-12-15 18:45:52] <dangerwhere> @Flats is the battlepass JQ sking epic in your opinion? peronally i LOVE it to put it mildly
[2022-12-15 18:45:53] <+Voxull_> is the jq healing buff noticeable?
[2022-12-15 18:45:55] <%$setcourseforoblivion> I find it funny that they have Hanzo Genji and Kiriko

[2022-12-15 18:46:51] <VainDash> I think the range on the swing should be a bit more further on Queen

[2022-12-15 19:18:51] <djzander_> they need to revert the ult changes
[2022-12-15 19:18:51] <FrosTKoi> oh, so the indend was close range widow?
[2022-12-15 19:18:51] <Ewytota123> wheres the damage nerf
[2022-12-15 19:18:52] <UncleReth> @CopperBoooom They addressed Hog, one-shot likely going away in January and maybe a soft rework coming after.
[2022-12-15 19:18:56] <%ElSimber> disruptor is huge
[2022-12-15 19:18:56] <+aaymon86> But did they address the secondary shot?

[2022-12-15 19:19:04] <robbo_155> this might be enough honestly, we'll see
[2022-12-15 19:19:05] <!%Blizz_Craig> Primary fire spread is how wide the projectiles from the primary fire flies from the gun, the bigger the weaker the damage output overall
[2022-12-15 19:19:06] <Yavvo> Run in like a wildman with no regard for your own life? Rewarded with a 100% railgun
[2022-12-15 19:19:06] <%$alenaistyping> they did it
[2022-12-15 19:19:10] <%pineappleguy8> SHES STILL GONNA BE STRONG

[2022-12-15 19:19:13] <LilyoftheVeil1> not addressing the one shots?
[2022-12-15 19:19:14] <%$alenaistyping> as I SAID THEY NEED TO PICK ONE
[2022-12-15 19:19:15] <Revenkin> needed a slower charge rate
[2022-12-15 19:19:16] <83driplord> Repent of your sins turn to Jesus ‚ù§Ô∏è
[2022-12-15 19:19:19] <%$jasonwocky> I'm at low ranks, and I don't care. Nerf it
[2022-12-15 19:19:19] <%$alenaistyping> they removed slow!
[2022-12-15 19:19:20] <%SkitzoCTRL> @kazenblade29 If they have CC, it needs to have risk. Like Mei has to be very close.
[2022-12-15 19:19:22] <%$alenaistyping> AWESOME
[2022-12-15 19:19:22] <%aurlohk> good fuck her
[2022-12-15 19:19:23] <djzander_> this is still good tho it‚Äôs better then nothing
[2022-12-15 19:19:24] <robbo_155> still gonna be strong but good changes i think
[2022-12-15 19:19:24] <%jpap967> Damn they didn't just nerf Sojourn, they made her damn near unviable lol
[2022-12-15 19:19:25] <%pineappleguy8> @pineappleguy8 yea i thought spread was speed
[2022-12-15 19:19:25] <%cptnbigrichard> still 1 shots almost the entire cast ResidentSleeper
[2022-12-15 19:19:26] <%+Shogun_Nando85> what website is this?

[2022-12-15 19:19:33] <jennpenn10> Disrupter still denies space which is good. The slow as annoying as hell.
[2022-12-15 19:19:34] <%+yaboiebby> link?
[2022-12-15 19:19:34] <%$alenaistyping> cd on slide should be 10 seconds

[2022-12-15 19:19:38] <@%chompchomp8> She still has the one shot...
[2022-12-15 19:19:38] <reallyfeelingit> Wait does that mean the railgun shot is now bigger..?
[2022-12-15 19:19:38] <fatgeek91> that weapon spread is a good change. It was either that or give her recoil(which I still think she should have)
[2022-12-15 19:19:39] <UncleReth> @CopperBoooom I agree that it needs to come sooner, but they had already addressed it.

[2022-12-15 19:19:48] <%$DraaxinLIVE> BRO IM SO HAPPY I WAS REALLY ABOUT TO QUIT OW
[2022-12-15 19:19:48] <%jonah_ward> no railgun changes is big sad man
[2022-12-15 19:19:49] <%+nighttrainlan3> Put her in the dirt
[2022-12-15 19:19:49] <SymbioticEXE> she can still one shot wtf
[2022-12-15 19:19:56] <%LordeAylin> flatsBelieve flatsBelieve flatsBelieve flatsBelieve
[2022-12-15 19:19:58] <+JustAboveYou> good nerf but why kill her kit ?
[2022-12-15 19:19:58] <FrosTKoi> 28% is insane
[2022-12-15 19:20:01] <%$alenaistyping> I think her slide should be 10 second Cd
[2022-12-15 19:20:02] <+senpaifredo> Still playable but not OP
[2022-12-15 19:20:03] <Lord__Tuba> i wanna see sojourn on the fucking ground of the win chart jesus christ
[2022-12-15 19:20:04] <%TheClimbingSloth> Patch notes were said to come out either today or tomorrow
[2022-12-15 19:20:05] <+daavinccii> people complaining about railgun. You have to nerf other stuff, you can't just destroy a hero
[2022-12-15 19:20:08] <ojarrett99> slightly change movement and boom sojourn is in line with the other dps
[2022-12-15 19:20:08] <+JustAboveYou> and still have other kits untouch ?
[2022-12-15 19:20:09] <%+RouzenSSM> @DraaxinLIVE Same homie
[2022-12-15 19:20:10] <SymbioticEXE> literally just nerf her railgun damage
[2022-12-15 19:20:11] <%$asfelon> EC130 flatsKEK flatsKEK
[2022-12-15 19:20:13] <NoxiousNerd> So...Sojourn no REAL Nerf...got it Devs GG SeemsGood
[2022-12-15 19:20:13] <ojarrett99> shes still going to be really strong
[2022-12-15 19:20:14] <djzander_> i feel like the 28% is actually gonna be pretty huge
[2022-12-15 19:20:16] <%+coble_> really hoping railgun change  sadge
[2022-12-15 19:20:17] <%noelpena> I think the spread was enough of a nerf though cause you also don't want the player to be unplayable idk
[2022-12-15 19:20:17] <+deeplesss> yeah yeah, but what about first 6 (i think 6?) shots, which are pin-point accurate? is it the same?
[2022-12-15 19:20:18] <+II_ELLUM_II> when are these changes live?
[2022-12-15 19:20:18] <+fanciestframe3> That is almost a third more spread
[2022-12-15 19:20:19] <shehehshw> link?
[2022-12-15 19:20:19] <%+Grassay> @jonah_ward well more spread will atleast result in cahrging it slower since you will miss a bit more at longer range
[2022-12-15 19:20:24] <+be9nz> so is she on range with like a cass?
[2022-12-15 19:20:27] <Nexallus> The biggest nerf is powerslide cd
[2022-12-15 19:20:27] <+v8hemi07> make power slide a damn 10s cd
[2022-12-15 19:20:32] <omar11825> i think shes still gon hbe busted icl
[2022-12-15 19:20:34] <%Tektronic22> im still gonna wipe my bronze opponents with 1 ult on sojourn lmao
[2022-12-15 19:20:35] <%+the25thsimpcoomer> Where can i see thi?
[2022-12-15 19:20:37] <relaxitsmax> means you can actually kill her before she yeets away
[2022-12-15 19:20:38] <+aaymon86> That should be a 10 second cooldown
[2022-12-15 19:20:39] <%$DraaxinLIVE> it should be 10s
[2022-12-15 19:20:40] <theonlyyorickmain01> would have preferred if they nerfed her damage rather than her utility
[2022-12-15 19:20:42] <ojarrett99> blizzard quite literally announced that they want her to be strong always
[2022-12-15 19:20:44] <+senpaifredo> Why do people want nerfs to crater characters instead of just balancing them?
[2022-12-15 19:20:45] <+zalg0text> nerfing her primary is an indirect rail gun nerf, because now she has to get in close and play riskier to charge it up
[2022-12-15 19:20:45] <wagwubeef> link???
[2022-12-15 19:20:47] <%SkitzoCTRL> @the25thsimpcoomer There on your screen or on Tuesday when patch notes go live.
[2022-12-15 19:20:48] <@%chompchomp8> still faster than genji dash...
[2022-12-15 19:20:48] <%$alenaistyping> emongg with me on this
[2022-12-15 19:20:49] <%aurlohk> put it on 20 seconds
[2022-12-15 19:20:50] <@%chompchomp8> Sadge
[2022-12-15 19:20:53] <Samtelegram> @SymbioticEXE nah those changes are not a good way to balance a character this broken
[2022-12-15 19:20:57] <+AlternateStateofMind> What if powerslide ate up her charge? ü§î
[2022-12-15 19:20:58] <+deeplesss> it doesnt negate here 1-hit potential
[2022-12-15 19:20:58] <+xRainManK> Where can we get this image ?
[2022-12-15 19:20:59] <shehehshw> is there a link to this?
[2022-12-15 19:20:59] <%+TheEmptySkys1> I don't think this is quite enough. With Mercy, her ult is stronger than it was prior to the rail damage nerf because you get to fire more one shots. Good step in the right direction though
[2022-12-15 19:20:59] <Ruryi> is there a link I can find this? I just got in the stream
[2022-12-15 19:21:00] <%noelpena> @theonlyyorickmain01  I agree
[2022-12-15 19:21:01] <%+protehqc> ult is still the same so it will be the same
[2022-12-15 19:21:02] <%+Cdog174> it should not be 10 seconds

[2022-12-15 19:25:27] <%+Beersens> kiriko is great
[2022-12-15 19:25:28] <%$alenaistyping> @Ski751 we do need cleanse in the game tho there is a lot of debuffs, immortality is the problem not clense.
[2022-12-15 19:25:28] <+v8hemi07> make it so that suzu doesn't cleanse rein shatter
[2022-12-15 19:25:28] <%+nickuhfoster> wrong nerf tho
[2022-12-15 19:25:29] <%+kazenblade29> So no last minute kiriko Suzu save from sigma ult?
[2022-12-15 19:25:30] <Samtelegram> @CopperBoooom ah ok, do you know they'll add hog to the patch too?
[2022-12-15 19:25:31] <FrosTKoi> power creep monkaS

[2022-12-15 19:25:33] <djzander_> it‚Äôs just more skill based now
[2022-12-15 19:25:33] <%+nickuhfoster> needs cooldown
[2022-12-15 19:25:34] <%jpap967> Kiriko nerfed last patch already, her ultimate takes pretty long to build up now
[2022-12-15 19:25:35] <KiwiKoe> Ain't no way people are complaining about suzu nerfs. If you want other supports to be as viable, nerf Kiriko lmao.
[2022-12-15 19:25:36] <%SkitzoCTRL> @ow_sigmaeats Yeap. It makes playing JQ or Ana feel pointless to play.
[2022-12-15 19:25:36] <Weakndope> where can i read these patchnotes?
[2022-12-15 19:25:39] <%EmpoweredWhiskey> they keep saying ‚Äúminor changes‚Äù when talking about kiriko but she got so many of those ‚Äúminor changes‚Äù already >_>
[2022-12-15 19:25:39] <Graf3X> wait so that page says that is the retail patch notes
[2022-12-15 19:25:39] <+thedragonarchitect> bring everyone up to kiriko not everyone down

[2022-12-15 19:25:46] <+KeiyosX> ngl suzu shouldnt even have the invuln just the cleanse
[2022-12-15 19:25:47] <%+The_Necrojoker> Cleanse is all it needs, It also, Heals 50 HP, displaces enemies AND makes allies untargetable.
[2022-12-15 19:25:48] <teotottis> where is the genji nerf
[2022-12-15 19:25:49] <%+nickuhfoster> she still gets it more often than ana's nade and its better
[2022-12-15 19:25:51] <fatgeek91> now we just need to nerf hogs breather and hook range and we'll have a good game
[2022-12-15 19:25:51] <%+Shogun_Nando85> what website is this from?

[2022-12-15 19:26:07] <+JustAboveYou> you are taking the power away from Kirko.

[2022-12-15 19:34:23] <%jpap967> @simonemrg Disruptor denies space, does a lot of damage. enough to kill squishies by itself if they stand in it
[2022-12-15 19:34:23] <%Ocara115> @DurpeeOW Because she isnt too strong and kinda needed some changes anyway?
[2022-12-15 19:34:26] <+SimoneMrg> @DraaxinLIVE If you can walk away with no slow it is little damage
[2022-12-15 19:34:27] <%+Redemption_FPS> Orisa Ult needs faster ramp speed
[2022-12-15 19:34:27] <yurirakun> let hog fly

[2022-12-15 19:34:40] <%+DurpeeOW> @Ocara115 she isnt hard countered by any tank in the game
[2022-12-15 19:34:42] <glidefoolv5> Honestly I'm just glad that the team is actually communicating with the community.

[2022-12-15 19:35:04] <%+DurpeeOW> @Ocara115 if every other tank is hard countered by another tank then she should be too
[2022-12-15 19:35:05] <ultimate_rogue> @ultimate_rogue seems like it, increased punch cd, less overhealth

[2022-12-15 19:39:41] <ojarrett99> @Flats do you think they should've disconnected healing from damage, i feel like more hps is not the move for this game.
[2022-12-15 19:39:41] <+wetsockss> ana still gets countered by kiriko cleanse anyways so i think this is good fair changes

[2022-12-15 20:24:44] <%Klassified13> Maybe because it was only on yours and emongg twitch so since it's not in a "Public space" such as overwatch Twitter account then it's not good communication to them for whatever reason
[2022-12-15 20:24:46] <%+Obscuras> Don't worry about it Flats. Twitter folk are a.. NPC breed.

[2022-12-15 20:28:04] <%axdragon1105> honestly people should be glad they even sat down with a few content creators to hear what they had to say about the patch. Maybe next time they will talk to whoever, but at least they communicated to someone what is going on rather rather do nothing.

But I could only activate and collect them if I used Chrome to see the desktop version of twitch. Safari didn‚Äôt work.

[2022-12-15 21:57:11] <%SkitzoCTRL> @Flats Just need a little bit of love for WB, JQ, and Rein for the tanks to be in a good place. Need a *tiny* bit of buffs for a couple DPS, and we're good.

[2022-12-15 21:57:43] <+JetStreakPlays> @Flats So are they trying to get rid of 1-shots across the board or mainly just tank 1-shots?
[2022-12-15 21:57:45] <$BodyOdor> I think rush is always better than Ana ult though
[2022-12-15 21:57:45] <+ShelVero> just run ana and kirko together haha
[2022-12-15 21:57:45] <%SkitzoCTRL> @Obscuras But Doom is good.
[2022-12-15 21:57:47] <+DoctorBadTouch> do you feel bad about being the reason doom is worse than he ever was before because of your vids?

[2022-12-15 21:58:28] <$BodyOdor> @isaacfunguy Moira definitely
[2022-12-15 21:58:29] <+mattchew374> Hog one shot is the only value to the character

[2022-12-15 21:58:32] <keiradraws164> I don't then they'll get rid of Widow or Hanzo 1 shots, cuz you gotta wait and aim for them so it's skill mostly

[2022-12-15 21:58:36] <quinstonn> @frycaramba Agreed, the damage should've ramped up faster but this change is just another nerf to Rein
[2022-12-15 21:58:37] <%robbo_155> It's early to say but if the game keeps bringing out patches like this then its got a good future
[2022-12-15 21:58:37] <monkebus> Is patch out?
[2022-12-15 21:58:38] <MathematicalPenguin> @flats Ana‚Äôs healing now on par with Bap‚Äôs which is great!

[2022-12-15 21:58:43] <+visceron85> Yeah remove hog one shot and it needs a "heavy rework" not a soft one
[2022-12-15 21:58:45] <golden_koi_> is ramattra now a top tier tank?
[2022-12-15 21:58:46] <itzdemery> do orisa spear go through shields

[2022-12-15 22:01:14] <+aemet98> @zemoreno Why would he be?, they buffed him a lot and then reverted some of the buffs he is still better than in season 1

[2022-12-15 22:04:56] <%KevinKalani> @razorbladed I play doom, he is not worse pre-patch and if you are using punch as movement, maybe it's a matter of changing your order of abilities...you know, kinda like Doom players did when they changed the seconds of cooldown in OW1
[2022-12-15 22:05:02] <tavyrn1> the whole point of the punch nerf was because it was easier to get charged but now its not

[2022-12-15 22:05:09] <+M2GAMER10> My favorite character is the reaper guy. he is very powerfull. special move, honestly is one of the best in the game and so he comes equipped with these two revolvers and only takes about 3 or 4 shots to actually execute a kill so it comes really in handy specially when you come from the side.
[2022-12-15 22:05:13] <da_borg> @tavyrn1  you get it off cd every 4 seconds, op for it to be a stun

[2022-12-15 22:11:48] <Harrowed_Scarlett> @vintageevan Support* But he's been playing a lot since he started playing OW2 cause he's able to more easily not play tank, and not have absolute withdrawals than emong.

[2022-12-15 22:16:29] <%d3athwish8> also to gauge how much pressure you need (they do it better in professional setting)

[2022-12-15 22:16:39] <Kaenopi> @coldvod oh nvm, its the ramattra drops, i got those already thats why. i thought it was the new dva drops, my bad.

[2022-12-15 22:16:45] <%+papercuts_409> @flats I hope you don't have it. but luckily CPAP are great to help it
[2022-12-15 22:16:46] <%coldvod> @panicpotato_ee dont you shoot bow and arrow my arms go all over the place sometimes i lose one too
[2022-12-15 22:16:47] <sea_slugggg> its even worse because if you lose oxygen you wake up everytime (whether you remeber it or not) and can make you sleep deprived

[2022-12-15 22:17:08] <%KevinKalani> If your sleep apnea is bad, it will pretty much choke you and wake you up and those constant wakings are bad for your heart too.

[2022-12-15 22:21:09] <calooble> Do you think push maps would be better if the match time was lowered to like 8 or 7 minutes
[2022-12-15 22:21:09] <Hreidmar1423> Orisa is very good in casual because of her resistance and the fact people don't know how to focus down in casual lobbies lol

[2022-12-15 22:21:10] <Arrivand> that's is gonna take some time to get used to
[2022-12-15 22:21:16] <ratah1nz> they gotta switch doom to dps they don't know what to do with him. he's either broken or horrible

[2022-12-15 22:21:42] <%+atsBrew> @MidniteMidas It was definitely more inclined as an indirect nerf to Roadhog, same with Ana NODDERS

[2022-12-15 22:26:59] <%KevinKalani> @LORDSIXDOUBLESIX The same can be said for any tank when they are in a broken/bad state. Hog was literally the worst tank before Zarya was nerfed. and people thought Hogs were throwing games

[2022-12-15 22:27:05] <superguest80> Orisa ult wouldn't be nearly as terrifying though if she didn't get a free Fortify with it. So they'll probably make it so you have to use your own Fortify cooldown if you want to get an uninterruptable ult off if they keep the pierce on it

[2022-12-15 22:28:03] <dancing_bread> what happened with ramattra?
[2022-12-15 22:28:04] <%jonah_ward> if rein lands a hammer swing he should get 10% speed boost for 2 seconds, for every swing but it only lasts 2 seconds and if he keeps swinging he maintains the boost

[2022-12-15 22:31:46] <+Bromora> @j_walk_the_wolf the level of coordination for the TP+Orisa ult combo is beyond the average match, you‚Äôd at least need to be duoing to consistently go for it, and even then there‚Äôs other variables that make it difficult to pull off well.

[2022-12-15 23:10:47] <%SpecsNStats> from what it sounded like, changing the hook probably introduced a bug that they couldnt immediately solve

[2022-12-15 23:10:51] <%axdragon1105> @murdock6 but you're literally have no brain cells, it's a change that they can't do with the hot fixing to do what they want to do. meaning it has nothing to do with numbers

[2022-12-15 23:12:25] <j_walk_the_wolf> @axdragon1105 exactly, there's a lot more to it than just a small change... literal insanity bawkSmile
[2022-12-15 23:12:25] <+KnownAsCream> It boggles my mind how they've consistently fucked up the Doomfist changes even with the direct feedback we give them.

[2022-12-15 23:13:02] <alphablaziwolf> Why is it bad?
[2022-12-15 23:13:03] <kettlerskyy> hanzo is ass anyway
[2022-12-15 23:13:03] <King_Naga> hanzo genji visual bugs are gross
[2022-12-15 23:13:04] <$Suspect333> chat is the patch live?
[2022-12-15 23:13:07] <@%chompchomp8> thats like finding and fixing actual bugs
[2022-12-15 23:13:08] <+Bromora> @ludusknight I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a big deal. The ult still isn‚Äôt particularly good IMO
[2022-12-15 23:13:12] <Arganamn> if this is the way patches gonna work in the future, im cool with it. That patch came out fast
[2022-12-15 23:13:13] <%wyxii_> patch is live
[2022-12-15 23:13:13] <+MyNameIsNeo7> but the hanzo recoil issue probably requires a "content" change which requires review on xbox/ps
[2022-12-15 23:13:16] <Murdock6> @axdragon1105 like they have taken the one shot from hog before just run the nerf back so people stop complaining
[2022-12-15 23:13:17] <+TheMrPenguini> @alphablaziwolf wdym its a bug and horribly distracting
[2022-12-15 23:13:23] <+Anym> @alphablaziwolf pretty sure it throws off a lot of people's aim due to the visuals
[2022-12-15 23:13:24] <%Friedolf> @Suspect333 perhaps it is :)
[2022-12-15 23:13:24] <+BlazingWombat> @acido_dna I got a msg from Twitch when mine was ready
