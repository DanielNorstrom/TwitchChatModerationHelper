[2022-12-29 14:32:54] <%+nekolasxd> which has the non pro tag
[2022-12-29 14:33:02] <%ActivateZeroG> @Axel_tv sound might be a bit more realistic now so youll hear echo from the other direction
[2022-12-29 14:33:07] <%Scooter7> Waving at PMC's like in the trailer works....right Kappa
[2022-12-29 14:33:15] <johnfrancoz> did they revamp the sound of the game in general?
[2022-12-29 14:33:17] <%+nekolasxd> statswise it is the same i think
[2022-12-29 14:33:29] <%Neisza> the new sound is so bad imo. You hear through walls as if people were breathing on your neck
[2022-12-29 14:33:30] <%ActivateZeroG> @johnfrancoz Yep

[2022-12-29 14:50:49] <+fullyvestedd> If you have some bleeds or damage across your entire body, it feels better to pop a propy than heal 6 individual times
[2022-12-29 14:50:57] <!mimikSVK> i got 35 FPS on lighthouse :(

[2022-12-29 14:53:21] <insane___dentist> went form 30-50 fps on streets to 70-90
[2022-12-29 14:53:27] <wanlaff> fps was fixed recently.

[2022-12-29 14:55:00] <+vihanenlintu> What level have you gotten to?

[2022-12-29 14:57:07] <@%ImSoBurr_> I think @Axel_tv would agree tho, 5800x3d if you have the means. Honestly can't say enough good things about the CPU, it crushes tarkov
[2022-12-29 14:57:07] <insane___dentist> ill play around and see
[2022-12-29 14:57:08] <%ActivateZeroG> I knew I had to upgrade my mobo when I wanted a new cpu

[2022-12-29 14:57:47] <%ActivateZeroG> @ImSoBurr_ I think its because of how ryzen cpus work with ram

[2022-12-29 15:00:22] <%ActivateZeroG> @Axel_tv I think Intel might be better for tarkov. The game should be optimised for single core cpus but the ram boost you get with ryzen makes it better

[2022-12-29 15:29:51] <odamnidied> i could hear a LOT more vertical audio in resort now, it's just a bit fucked right now. I think once they fix it, sound might be good finally
[2022-12-29 15:29:56] <%+biglefteye> its unoptimized

[2022-12-29 16:57:21] <@%mfrayd> my guess is no, Samples doesn't require the new stims because BSG forgot to update the quest. They'll update it in a couple weeks probably
[2022-12-29 16:57:22] <%bubble_d> Im surprised BSG is doing drops so early. I wonder if they'll compare to the ETS gift of 300 M855a1

[2022-12-29 17:21:21] <@%mfrayd> you need to survive for both
[2022-12-29 17:21:24] <Psychojohnny4> @kmovsky what about the  dt990 ?
[2022-12-29 17:21:24] <%+LegendUK> what is binaural sound
[2022-12-29 17:21:35] <%Qweets> someone said you get more fps with binaural off, did you notice this @Axel_tv ?
[2022-12-29 17:21:42] <@%mfrayd> chat you should probably disable binaural
[2022-12-29 17:21:48] <%PawniacWasTaken> @Qweets Yes
[2022-12-29 17:21:58] <pandavkaske_ttv> Привет , а как сейчас рабоатет выход Д2 ??
[2022-12-29 17:21:59] <%PawniacWasTaken> Binaural sounds fried for me and drops me to 5 fps
[2022-12-29 17:22:00] <%PawniacWasTaken> it's aids
[2022-12-29 17:22:05] <%+LegendUK> @mfrayd what does it do even
[2022-12-29 17:22:06] <%+KMovsky> I'm pretty sure they are the same spec-wise, it's just DT990 are open while DT770s are closed, meaning with DT990 more sounds from your surroundings will get through to you
[2022-12-29 17:22:17] <%$HazardwasteQc> I noticed the fuck out of it… I had 30fps in reserve last night, turned it off, jumped to 100…

[2022-12-29 17:23:59] <%+KMovsky> I actually went with wireless headset, which was a big concern for me considering I play tarkov a lot, but nowadays there are some great wireless headsets that compete with wired ones
[2022-12-29 17:24:01] <+GilSilvaGS> Theres one at cottage but doesnt work

[2022-12-29 17:24:31] <%bubble_d> @KMovsky biggest issue i have with my wireless is the weight. having a battery pack in the headset really chunks it up

[2022-12-29 17:25:20] <%+KMovsky> @KMovsky That's true, they're definitely heavier than the wired, very often when I was trying them out I couldn't move my head too fast or they would fall
[2022-12-29 17:25:22] <%+Tranqui> @axel_tv don't expose them LUL LUL LUL
[2022-12-29 17:25:39] <%bubble_d> 2k @ 60fps is about what im running at
[2022-12-29 17:25:40] <%+KMovsky> that was an issue with Razer Naga, which I bought, had for a couple of days and sold it right after that

[2022-12-29 17:27:27] <%+KMovsky> I gotta say, I switched from RTX 2070 to rx6950xt last month and it was best decision performance-wise, went from a ~40fps (DLSS is a joke) to stable ~120 fps on every map, and man FSR2.1 is a beaut
[2022-12-29 17:27:36] <@%ImSoBurr_> @mfrayd don't think so, it wouldn't take 30 rd m4 mags

[2022-12-29 17:33:33] <%+KMovsky> That's actually not true, because 'business connection' is hella expensive and that's because of the guaranteed amount of availability
[2022-12-29 17:33:37] <%+KMovsky> I used to order these for my company

[2022-12-29 17:37:07] <%+KMovsky> all I'm saying is: the so called 'enterprise connection' costs a lot because business depends on it and you buy it with '99,9999% availability' guarantee, which you cannot get from your local ISP
[2022-12-29 17:37:08] <!%+kyle1457> we are doing great

[2022-12-29 17:39:36] <%$kiris95> @kiris95 yeah, but 500 on a 1GB? A bit disappointed if I'm honest. I was hoping for at least 700mb

[2022-12-29 20:28:02] <%Yuki_Duki> so how the F we gonna extract if we dont have train, d2 or red rebel
[2022-12-29 20:28:03] <+otacon237> i guess they dont want people just rushing down to d2 every raid
[2022-12-29 20:28:05] <jQueued> you just extract as normal even though there is no HUD prompt

[2022-12-29 20:44:18] <%p_mob> queue times are atrocious
[2022-12-29 20:44:31] <!%$Ciphestor> Honestly I think binaural on sounds better, has more direction
[2022-12-29 20:44:32] <+otacon237> wait for everyone to come home from work kek
[2022-12-29 20:44:35] <$kamper1pl1> no ocolus adio is on;y on some maps i think
[2022-12-29 20:44:40] <%TruuuMalaysian> no swap headphone?
[2022-12-29 20:44:46] <%pike14> just leave
[2022-12-29 20:44:49] <%Yuki_Duki> "n short, binaural audio is a type and method of recording that reproduces the way humans naturally experience sound" binaureal audio is just a rendering method, you are still using oculus, steam audio got removed

[2022-12-29 20:44:56] <yomaz2> @Axel_tv фпс лучше на картах стал? Я не смогу ещё неделю играть прост
[2022-12-29 20:45:00] <%Cyanon_gK> Oculus audio is all of it, binaural is only for directional aspect of oculus as far as I understand it.
[2022-12-29 20:45:02] <kodysoch> lmfao nobody knows with the audio in this game
[2022-12-29 20:45:02] <gruntsrule_> Hey Axel! Im just curious, did you have to change your audio settings this wipe? All of my settings are the same but I cant seem to pin point where people and shots are

[2022-12-29 20:45:13] <skeden1> the problem here is the helmet
[2022-12-29 20:45:14] <+ImmoraTV> Binaural takes data from environment and with some cool math turns stereo output to life like sound

[2022-12-29 21:36:12] <%xSh4d3R> so that means the animation is broken, so you could walk through the door while its "closed" i guess

[2022-12-29 21:39:18] <!%$Bert_Bufftug> @Axel_tv That isn't what I'm saying. I'm saying that if you expect garbage, when you ultimately get that you won't be upset, as opposed to hoping for fat loots and then getting disappointed repeatedly.
