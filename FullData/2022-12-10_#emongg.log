[2022-12-10 00:49:12] <alight_razor4> nano works well with his ult plus kiriko it's like an instant teamwipe
[2022-12-10 00:49:12] <Crosis86> nah itll be "We heard you ramatra is a little underwhelming heres some sojourn buffs to make him feel better"
[2022-12-10 00:49:22] <+ThemApplesDood> let's face it a slightly weaker hero upon release is way better than a broken op one

[2022-12-10 00:49:32] <xblessangelx> Rammatra shield should stay up until destroyed, it goes down too quickly.

[2022-12-10 01:18:27] <@%^StreamElements> kastavro, To earn drops you must claim them from your Twitch Inventory. You will need to claim your first drop before you can earn progress towards the next. You will be notified in chat and your notifications feed when you're able to claim. You can find your inventory and progress at twitch.tv/drops

[2022-12-10 01:18:31] <@%^StreamElements> If you're noticing ads at unfortunate times, Twitch now requires all streams to run ads at set intervals. We're not triggering them, they're on Twitch's end and out of our control.

[2022-12-10 17:27:38] <jaser_2008> Please answer
[2022-12-10 17:27:38] <+BigBootyBandit5> With less ppl you really cant when its the only single role

[2022-12-10 17:27:44] <vorrtEHx> aceofCarry
[2022-12-10 17:27:46] <+FLCLfan> the only "fix" is increasing the overlap inbetween ranks queuing together
[2022-12-10 17:27:46] <mrmoistiesgoodies> Is it ramattra time?
[2022-12-10 17:27:50] <its_mrriceguy> 2 tanks lmao
[2022-12-10 17:27:51] <JustALilCub> not even priority passes would fix it because everyone would be forced to do it and it would make no difference :O
[2022-12-10 17:27:52] <Yummy_Bubbles> is it because top 500 tank is over-saturated? or is it because not enough tank players are that high?
[2022-12-10 17:27:52] <lokibori> Eliminating 6v6 to 1 less really screwed things up
[2022-12-10 17:28:01] <ColonelBT> they let people 5 stack in bronze but not gm?

[2022-12-10 17:28:18] <+Damonoxide> I'd like to see a 5-stack rank queue, seperate from normal ranked
[2022-12-10 17:28:18] <+omnideoist> a lot of the time DPS and healer are just as fast or faster than tank for me in comp. and I've been too lazy to play much comp, in high silver due to the rank reset. LUL

[2022-12-10 21:15:51] <+ianhardt> I WISH BALL WASNT IN THE GAME
[2022-12-10 21:15:51] <vernpwns> Ball is my most played Hero, but nowadays i just get flamed as soon as i pick him, even though i usually do good
[2022-12-10 21:15:56] <vinncentsg> im lvl 20 in the BP have seen this map a grand total of 1 ttime
[2022-12-10 21:16:01] <bog_cog> @swigityswag6969 I'm the latter
[2022-12-10 21:16:07] <%ne0n_black> ball is even more unkillable than hog so idk if giving him a lot of damage is a good idea
[2022-12-10 21:16:19] <%redkakti> @redkakti AC valhalla is good my brother finished it but i think i'm getting little overwhealmed the map is huge and instead of doing tasks from main story i was going around looking for resources so i got distracted a lot KEKW
[2022-12-10 21:16:21] <%bolbi_in_canada> ball still really good on lijiang

[2022-12-10 21:19:29] <vinncentsg> Hog is only meta cause no other tank can survive with the state of supports

[2022-12-10 21:19:43] <soord_n_boord> I think hog just needs less damage resistance while he's healing, and it's high time he loses the ability to one-shot.  Other than that he's great.

[2022-12-10 21:19:45] <apotatobird> @fakekeks  yeah he's got great survivability and he's fundamentally an easier tank to play AND his combo is lethal if you add a dedicated support pocket that equals a NIGHTMARE

[2022-12-10 21:36:01] <+johnpr> 15k and 40 elims in QP is....a bit nuts...
[2022-12-10 21:36:02] <landskildpadde> 15k is absurd!
[2022-12-10 21:36:05] <%bolbi_in_canada> i did not think 10 elims with ult would be this hard

[2022-12-10 21:44:47] <TheGreekSpeedster> @redkakti I got the pass and unless i am high... they secretly nerfed the XP you get per game. I get 700 xp on loss and 1000 xp on wins.
[2022-12-10 21:44:59] <apotatobird> how would my support main feel about lower "heal" output for their team but higher damage/survival ability? make us truly supports and not healbots

[2022-12-10 21:46:54] <Huynh__> @apotatobird well, personally as an ana main, i just like the idea of a minor movement ability or a slight movement speed buff for all but lucio (he would be broken)
[2022-12-10 21:47:01] <%+runy91> @alucard8732 nope ana sleep got buffed :)
[2022-12-10 21:47:16] <Huynh__> 1 second isnt a lot

[2022-12-10 21:47:24] <%+runy91> its till a buff
[2022-12-10 21:47:24] <apotatobird> @alucard8732 maybe it's bc they're afraid that if they make supports viable the DPS mains will revolt lol
[2022-12-10 21:47:27] <ZionRL> "sleep got buffed" not when kiriko exists
[2022-12-10 21:47:29] <xa9128> @alucard8732 it took years for tank. I played main tank in ow. it was hell for a long time and never got fixed until they just removed a tank

[2022-12-10 21:48:26] <+alucard8732> @apotatobird I dunno but if blizzard keeps going down this road I don't see a future for 5v5. no one will wanna touch support at all

[2022-12-10 21:51:15] <%$DeIta9> do you think it's better to have the new hero be undertuned? better than being OP and getting nerfed to hell like jq
[2022-12-10 21:51:17] <%+omnideoist> i think ramattra is fun, but shield and damage feel undertuned. vortex is weird
[2022-12-10 21:51:18] <%+runy91> @P01S0N_IV good luck. show em your doom KEKW
[2022-12-10 21:51:19] <%+DylanInSpace> I think they could swap 50 of his base health for armor

[2022-12-10 22:08:13] <+Supertek> @simzeex 4 is highest

[2022-12-10 22:08:37] <+jasonw002> it is probably bugged that you take 300 dmg

[2022-12-10 22:08:53] <+jasonw002> so really u need to take 1500 to mitigate 300
[2022-12-10 22:08:55] <mechamoescobar> @simzeex 5 is the last
[2022-12-10 22:09:01] <+johnpr> @Niteblooded he did...no good
[2022-12-10 22:09:01] <%+DylanInSpace> @jasonw002 Ohh you mean you take 300 hp instead of block 300 hp

[2022-12-10 22:09:28] <+jasonw002> cuz to take 300 dmg while blocking u need to take really 1500

[2022-12-10 22:10:18] <simzeex> @Supertek 4 is the highest fr
[2022-12-10 22:10:26] <SoumaOW> yeah the wording must be odd. take 300 means your health decrease 300 not mitigate 300
[2022-12-10 22:10:29] <%Nennai> KEKW
[2022-12-10 22:10:33] <dabwang> considering it's 80% reduction, and u blocked 300, it should atleast be 1500

[2022-12-10 22:24:07] <Cybertronlaser> @ElectricCopper from my understanding midseason is like after the first 2 weeks of the season and before last 2 weeks, because those are when the most casual players (and throwers) are playing

[2022-12-10 23:08:15] <+costa_twofour> There are 50 different types of cole slaw that taste wildly different so it's kind of impossible to flatly say you like or dislike it as a rule
[2022-12-10 23:08:25] <bigboipablo01> ketchup is pretty mid

[2022-12-10 23:09:20] <radiumman> The trick is to always get cherry or grape tomatoes, most big tomatoes are harvested early and artificially ripened. That takes away their flavour. That process doesn't occur with grape and cherry tomatoes, so you get that juicy, somewhat earthy flavour

[2022-12-10 23:25:52] <dredlock470> Hog is a meta tank KEKW never thought Id see the day
[2022-12-10 23:25:55] <%ne0n_black> @enreves dont forget also hard countering most of the other tanks
[2022-12-10 23:26:00] <%apotatobird> maybe boost Ramattra? he just seems weak and easily countered
[2022-12-10 23:26:18] <%apotatobird> hog is still kinda a problem though
[2022-12-10 23:26:24] <%TsunamiArmy> Hog was meta a good while ago.
[2022-12-10 23:26:29] <%ne0n_black> @apotatobird I tend to agree but noone is playing him correctly on ladder yet

[2022-12-10 23:28:27] <%ne0n_black> @BengalsFan4Lyf sadly ramattra is ass at actually going in. Gotta play long range poke. I'm not sure if he's any good at that or not but I haven't really adapted to the playstyle yet. I think the design is unfortunate and boring, but if you buff ramattra and he's insane at long range poke and being immortal we bascially go back to double shield meta

[2022-12-10 23:59:03] <@%^StreamElements> My favorite character is the awcrap guy. he is very powerfull. special move, honestly is one of the best in the chat and so he comes equipped with these two standards and only takes about 3 or 4 memes to actually timeout a poopoo head so it comes really in handy specially when you come from the side.
