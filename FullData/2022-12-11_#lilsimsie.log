[2022-12-11 00:36:10] <NicholeNelson> It was a fun challenge to add to the sims and it cool to see how everyone decided to do things
[2022-12-11 00:36:14] <Vrontide> i had so much fun with mine, i turned it into a cat cafe
[2022-12-11 00:36:17] <Moonie14> i vote next time you do 2 days of tour streams so it gives some people a bit more chance to get seen
[2022-12-11 00:36:17] <@%+MrsTomato101814> @BarelyAMillennial if kayla doesnt tour your build she refunds the points!
[2022-12-11 00:36:19] <@%+ceesees> @boopingbeebo she's only touring from the point redeems!

[2022-12-11 00:36:54] <kalzuul> this shell honestly forced me to branch out, i made a community lot and used more debug than i normally do, so it helped put me out of my comfort zone

[2022-12-11 00:41:48] <svetlllama> i love the stone column
[2022-12-11 00:41:52] <barbietheninja> its because u dont need to clean inbetween the tiles in the sims.
[2022-12-11 00:41:58] <greatkaiit> Yaaaas I grew up in Florida too! Whole house was that exact tile except one room
[2022-12-11 00:42:00] <linkforlife299> I love building in the Sims, even more than actually playing it.
[2022-12-11 00:42:04] <v0idsss> i love that tile
[2022-12-11 00:42:09] <froggyballs101> Yeah I live in Oklahoma that’s what we have, but at my moms house we have brown tile which is kinda vibe
[2022-12-11 00:42:10] <oceana_blue> This reminds me of a hotel abroad in somewhere like Spain, I love it! 🥺

[2022-12-11 00:52:00] <sophiesaurus95> i like to do half communtiy and half residential. so abig lot with lots on it. maybe a few houses. so it's a community
[2022-12-11 00:52:00] <ClariSury> if i had spa day i would definitely use that lot
[2022-12-11 00:52:04] <vikii1005> i have never done a community lot for a shell it's scary
[2022-12-11 00:52:08] <xxmoonlight007> i'm so happy that's not the only one having gallary problems
[2022-12-11 00:52:08] <+dkate2008> I can't believe I actually made it to a stream! I adore you!
[2022-12-11 00:52:10] <@%$Little_Dica> I think the best community lot to build to practice is food related ones, like cafes and bars and restaurants
[2022-12-11 00:52:14] <$aluminium_iodide> RIGGED
[2022-12-11 00:52:14] <+Moobuttt> the gallery is getting real sick of you opening it up so much i guess LOL

[2022-12-11 01:08:20] <+beeepig> actually even if mine doesn't get picked I'm still happy to do it since making the shell is like the hardest part for me so the fact that that's already done is helpful lmao

[2022-12-11 15:22:14] <%EeveeTinn> is it still worth getting it? I currently cannot afford switch but one day i want it

[2022-12-11 15:22:15] <the_simmer_jps> sad about what???
[2022-12-11 15:22:16] <%+TheGurker> I’d love to play ac but buying a switch just to play it is too much
[2022-12-11 15:22:18] <+Bubbbsy> they might make a smaller spinoff game
[2022-12-11 15:22:20] <venlu> the waisted potential

[2022-12-11 15:22:31] <yabnouk> at first i thought they said they woulve been updating for longer than they did
[2022-12-11 15:22:31] <sofiehvedelll> that sucks
[2022-12-11 15:22:32] <%+pebbles85> is such a shame because there is so much they could do we would love
[2022-12-11 15:22:32] <catbookluvr> even if they charged i would have bought every dlc

[2022-12-11 15:22:48] <%$forthehopeofitall> @EeveeTinn i think so! nothing new might be added anymore, but it's a complete game that's a lot of fun!
[2022-12-11 15:22:49] <%+absolutewalnut96> I agree
[2022-12-11 15:22:50] <%3580katie> Is the Logitech giveaway still open?

[2022-12-11 15:22:51] <seashell_arts> worse for them! anyone would buy anything animal crossing related
[2022-12-11 15:22:57] <andreaaar28> What is dlc short of?

[2022-12-11 15:22:58] <willowthe_goddess> Hii
[2022-12-11 15:22:58] <EvangelineWalton> @Bearded_Iris I'm in England, so none: they are practice exams, because in England we don't do credits, instead I will sit 36 final exams at the end of this school year, so these are "mock" exams
[2022-12-11 15:22:59] <+maxomenox> tbh i find it so cool that theyve been updating it since this year cause ive been playing animal crossing since wild world and i dont think theyve updated a game so much ever
[2022-12-11 15:22:59] <%EeveeTinn> so sad since it was released only in 2020
[2022-12-11 15:23:01] <@%goosekingdom> @3580katie no!
[2022-12-11 15:23:02] <a_friedbug> I haven’t played animal crossing since summer, but I kinda wanna play it now, I just have to charge my switch first

[2022-12-11 15:23:20] <sofiehvedelll> would be fun if they did rebranded versions of the older games for switch, kinda like they do for Pokémon

[2022-12-11 15:25:10] <gracehill_> This stream is making me less anxious about my classes lol because my teachers havent graded my final projects
[2022-12-11 15:25:15] <raeedwards> For how popular the game is I’m surprised they didn’t add more DLC’s
[2022-12-11 15:25:15] <allie_0907> I have alot of work to make up at school, Saturday school, then inventory w/ my dad at his store next Sunday and then exams and then an awards assembly on the 23rd then I have winter break. 😫
[2022-12-11 15:25:15] <tswizzee> unlike Disney Dreamlight that's updating so often 😁

[2022-12-11 15:25:26] <%$forthehopeofitall> i dont think its lacking anything, obviously itd be great if new content kept coming, but i still think it's a great game that isn't missing anything
[2022-12-11 15:25:28] <%$sherrybomb44> Nintendo would be devastated if they knew how much money I'd spend on animal crossing dlc lol
[2022-12-11 15:25:31] <+orlzcakes> i allowed my sister to move into my island (shared nintendo) and now her house is in the way of everything because she doesn’t play
