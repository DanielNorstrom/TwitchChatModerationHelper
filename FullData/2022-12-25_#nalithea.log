[2022-12-25 00:32:07] <ShadowCatGambit> Hanzo is unconfirmed, but I think he's leaning toward siding with Genji

[2022-12-25 00:34:03] <@%Grimstab77> @Nalithea after blackwatch was dissolved. Genji was still struggling to accept his body and went on a pilgrimage. He met Zenyatta who helped Genji accept his new body. He regained his joy of life after accepting himself

[2022-12-25 00:38:23] <AtlantisPrince> Hanzo is basically the head of the Yakuza, what makes him very conflicted. Genji moved on, even though Hanzo, his own brother, was the one almost killing him.

[2022-12-25 00:39:38] <AtlantisPrince> @Grimstab77 Happy holidays.
[2022-12-25 00:39:56] <@%Grimstab77> @Nalithea basically Shimada family is a Yakuza family. After Hanzo tried to kill genji Hanzo abandoned the Yakuza and went alone to repent as he could never forget himself.

[2022-12-25 00:40:58] <ShadowCatGambit> that's exactly what he want to do, kill the supports and Squishies

[2022-12-25 00:41:34] <bramknox> hanzo also stopped weilding the blade ever since his murder of genji
[2022-12-25 00:41:45] <@%Grimstab77> I think Kiriko's family is guardian of tradition of the fox spirit. They're training Shimada's high ranking family member for combat.
[2022-12-25 00:42:05] <AtlantisPrince> Yakuza is a whole different thing than the Mafia.

[2022-12-25 00:47:59] <%+MALYG0S> The reason that they're not being targeted is because they help comunities and that if a problem arises with the police it will be at such extream levels that it would be more trouble than good for the comunities

[2022-12-25 20:25:39] <@%Grimstab77> Also that's not true. OkCode is playing mostly Genshin. I stream almost only overwatch. And there's a lot of streamers that just stream one main game. It's perfectly fine to be a vtuber with a main game

[2022-12-25 20:28:57] <%+koyomides> Hi Happy Xmas! Your personality so refreshing compared to the other vtuber nalithLove
[2022-12-25 20:29:00] <@%Grimstab77> I prefer watching streamers with a main game that's more interesting to watch than streamers that just play games that are popular to get money from the hype wave.
[2022-12-25 20:29:14] <@%Grimstab77> Hey everyone who arrived.
[2022-12-25 20:29:16] <%+MALYG0S> The big ones have expectations put on them, to always play what's new and trendy (Flavor of the Week/Month), but that doesn't mean you're forced to do it yourself.

[2022-12-25 23:14:55] <@%Grimstab77> Well there's a way to remove ads on twitch. you can sub, so you support the streamer and you don't get ads. But understand that if you don't sub, watching ads allows you to support streamers for free!
[2022-12-25 23:14:58] <%+pyromana192> @Grimstab77 Thats how tik tok makes money germany doesnt have anything to do with that

[2022-12-25 23:50:41] <FenrirGodPoker> But againts roadhog ana is good for antiheal
[2022-12-25 23:50:42] <%Ryunnare> even learn how to kill with genji
[2022-12-25 23:50:59] <n1kasa69> well imma go
[2022-12-25 23:50:59] <malik189_> Yeah but genji is def alright but the thing is u have to be begging for Neal cause otherwise things r not working
[2022-12-25 23:51:00] <%+vikbarkrat> genji is that one kid who had too much sugar ...i cnt play well with him
[2022-12-25 23:51:09] <n1kasa69> gn guys cya tmrw
[2022-12-25 23:51:38] <%+maska187> @n1kasa69 byeee

[2022-12-25 23:51:47] <%+vikbarkrat> @n1kasa69 Gn
[2022-12-25 23:51:57] <malik189_> Plus u need someone to heal u a lot w genji and that doesn’t work so well partly so yeah
[2022-12-25 23:52:05] <%+pyromana192> @Sadoya there was but twitch didnt have them activated yet
[2022-12-25 23:52:09] <%Sadoya> dva xmas skin? dope.

[2022-12-25 23:52:23] <%+vikbarkrat> drops are temporary, Nali is forever!!!!
[2022-12-25 23:52:25] <@%Grimstab77> Twitch is brainlagging and can't put a drop campaign LUL
[2022-12-25 23:52:27] <malik189_> Like u mainly need an elite support to play genji effectively i think
[2022-12-25 23:52:34] <ThrashPotatoes> I used to be decent with Genji when game first came out, but I only recently started playing again so I've forgotten how to play almost everything
[2022-12-25 23:52:53] <@%Grimstab77> @malik189_ yes that is very true. Since the nerf it's very hard to pull something out of genji without a good support duo.
[2022-12-25 23:53:09] <%+pyromana192> Poor torb got called roadhog
[2022-12-25 23:53:17] <%+maska187> @malik189_ instead of support, genji can be played around health packs
[2022-12-25 23:53:27] <@%Grimstab77> You gotta win this one
[2022-12-25 23:53:31] <%+vikbarkrat> Genji is good with a zen orb on him or a lucio following him or pocket mercy
[2022-12-25 23:53:36] <@%Grimstab77> So we can finish the prediction xD
[2022-12-25 23:53:52] <malik189_> Fr fr that’s why I started searching for a new main (mercy) bc genji is unplayable especially bc Om not a veteran so there’s not many rlly good@healers and yeah
[2022-12-25 23:53:57] <@%Grimstab77> Genji got nerfed so many times and he got buffed twice XD
[2022-12-25 23:53:58] <hinjahfue> rank?
[2022-12-25 23:54:08] <@%Grimstab77> Shhhh you win

[2022-12-25 23:54:24] <%+pyromana192> you will win this or I cry for my pints
[2022-12-25 23:54:31] <malik189_> Yeah but having to collect health packs constantly isn’t effective bc u wont be able to kill much or do much dmg
[2022-12-25 23:54:33] <%+pyromana192> points
[2022-12-25 23:54:36] <@%Grimstab77> Something that feels good. Especially when you taste it.
