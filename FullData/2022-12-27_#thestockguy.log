Some Genocides were happening there. My mom knew a Croation immigrant that worked for her company.

[2022-12-27 18:28:18] <+drath____> having a house lets you grill and have a yard for your dog though

[2022-12-27 18:28:31] <+eksavyur> Also with home ownership, you can get absolutely dicked on by property taxes
[2022-12-27 18:28:32] <+Banghatsu> @wthandrew if DCA wins 33% of the time this is probably that time
[2022-12-27 18:28:35] <MobbDeep109> What do you think about CH Robinson stock?
[2022-12-27 18:28:36] <CaptPooFingers> Hamburglar?
[2022-12-27 18:28:49] <KevChurro> got an annoying neighbor? easier to move when renting
[2022-12-27 18:28:54] <+sugmabeanz> It's highly scenario-based though. Cheaper rent with a 0% return isn't always better than a mortgage that at least has a chance to return something
[2022-12-27 18:28:55] <wthandrew> @Banghatsu thx
[2022-12-27 18:28:56] <drizzle_1_> Getting a good landlord is awesome too. My sister has been renting a small house for $400 a month for 12 years.
