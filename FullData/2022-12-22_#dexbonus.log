[2022-12-22 15:39:36] <waffleho> Friendships that fall apart can end up being like relationships where you don’t see how bad of a fit it was until you’re out of it.
[2022-12-22 15:39:40] <%konataizumi1982> there's a handful of people I value in my life and would do my best to never lose them, could not imagine life without them

[2022-12-22 15:39:57] <+MizunoSakura> It's nice reconnecting with people. One thing I struggle with is I don't really go through that feeling of disconnection so even if I haven't spoken to someone in like... 10 years, I still think of them super fondly and am always happy to hear from them and it's been weird to learn that's not how it works for most people.

[2022-12-22 15:40:47] <%$MightyDeekin> @mizunosakura do you also sometimes find yourself continuing a conversation with someone from like a week ago?
[2022-12-22 15:40:51] <%Beatrice0> @QueirdKryptid I got lucky with like.. one job where I made a friend or two, but we didn't become friends until like... a year after that company closed.  Then we've started making friends with other parents at our kiddo's daycare... that's worked kind of okay so far.
[2022-12-22 15:41:01] <ThousandManx> yeah I was really close to a buddy of mine for 20 years and we haven't spoken in like 6 or 7 months now
[2022-12-22 15:41:25] <BudoKahn> but musically and theatrically you were, are the strongest of the OG group.
[2022-12-22 15:41:34] <%BobbiTheDragon> true frinds stay when it rough for you and when its good, like if something bad happens to you you help them and support you, if they dont they are not your friend

[2022-12-22 16:04:50] <Trongan> @Nirofen it also depends on where the school is located. afaik the funding comes directly from taxes from the immediate surrounding area
[2022-12-22 16:04:50] <frogs_on_quads> I went to a private Christian school. most of the teachers were from the church. I was an all A student. went to public school at 10 and was SO behind

[2022-12-22 16:52:38] <Dwomutsiqsa> There's definitely a meta to it, but won't spoil if you wanna figure it out yourself
[2022-12-22 16:52:47] <gloomyspacebastard> Used to be the way was only in the library with a certain character with a certain weapon set in an exact spot
[2022-12-22 16:52:51] <+primpete> it was so cheesy though
[2022-12-22 16:52:54] <+berbils> Well, there was a "cheat" method people used and now there's a legit way
[2022-12-22 16:52:57] <RushUnplugged> the endgame is pretty much building up to killing Death regularly
[2022-12-22 16:52:59] <%+Zingetorix> The old way was so convoluted
[2022-12-22 16:52:59] <%W_Tile> oh...

[2022-12-22 16:53:07] <+primpete> the old way was rediculous!
[2022-12-22 16:53:08] <%+kipsys> There was a trick in beta but that isn't needed anymore.
[2022-12-22 16:53:15] <%+Empty_Cognizance> the secret can only be uttered with lute music playing in the background

[2022-12-22 16:53:30] <Badgerconda_> oh wait, is there some 'official' way to do it now? I was thinking of a certain weapon

[2022-12-22 16:53:32] <%+ffiveAM> oh there's a new way now? hmmm haven't played in a while
[2022-12-22 16:53:35] <PHbulad> Before I found out the cheese way I accidently killed death
[2022-12-22 16:53:37] <+7_r_3_v_0_r> believe it!
[2022-12-22 16:53:45] <+primpete> I had to look it up myself
[2022-12-22 16:53:46] <+berbils> The old ways required specific chants in the middle of the forest on the 1st full moon of an even numbered month while doing a dance
[2022-12-22 16:53:51] <%Sprinklethelichking> you just gotta beilieve it doogWeeb
[2022-12-22 16:53:52] <RushUnplugged> @Badgerconda_ there's a few builds that regularly do it
[2022-12-22 16:53:56] <Drathak> I do believe it requires the power of friendship and determination
[2022-12-22 16:53:56] <PHbulad> It involves getting stop time and shield
[2022-12-22 16:54:01] <@%telosie> @Sprinklethelichking nice LOL
[2022-12-22 16:54:02] <theinoculator> Have you considered trying the power of friendship on it?

[2022-12-22 17:03:13] <LoadStarEightOne> I've been enjoying it quite a bit as an anime-only.  Last episode didn't hit me as hard as several of the previous ones, but that might be because another anime the same week really twisted the knife on the viewers and I'm all out of shock to experience.
[2022-12-22 17:03:43] <%$Dohregard> is it me or is there no musics
