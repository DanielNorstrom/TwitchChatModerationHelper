Please don't make a big deal about it or guilt her in chat. It's really upsetting to have people complaining all day when we're just trying to have fun. She has TONS of Sims content on YouTube, and we'll play The Sims again later this week.

[2022-12-08 22:31:44] <%maybeitswieb> it really didn't age well tho

[2022-12-08 22:31:46] <AnxiouslyAnIntrovert> Glee got better when Blaine showed up
[2022-12-08 22:31:48] <%$forthehopeofitall> and something it is
[2022-12-08 22:31:51] <@%+ceesees> @dalma2200 read the announcements channel

[2022-12-08 22:31:54] [Announcement] <Moobot> We're playing a bit of Dreamlight Valley tonight! For updates on the stream schedule, check Kayla's Discord! simsiePanic
[2022-12-08 22:31:55] <cupcakemagic420> I can’t watch it because the second hand embarrassment is too much
[2022-12-08 22:31:57] <%+bex2600> my roomie and i regularly go back and watch our personal fav episodes
[2022-12-08 22:31:58] <%$mia_noelle97> i recently finished rewatching glee and some of the plotlines were so unhinged
[2022-12-08 22:32:02] <OrganicCannedMonster95> Yikes
[2022-12-08 22:32:03] <$StarchildTTV> I was such a Gleek that I saw the first live show on Broadway lol
[2022-12-08 22:32:08] <$honeyspawn> i watched it when it was on too. glee was a weird moment in pop culture
[2022-12-08 22:32:09] <%+evitagon123> Mikes mic made me rewatch glee
[2022-12-08 22:32:10] <%+AndiNOTfromToyStory> was expecting sims when i joined, not disappointed to see DDLV instead 😂
[2022-12-08 22:32:11] <%plantsy> ryan murphy makes the most dramatic and questionable tv that is so fun to watch
[2022-12-08 22:32:12] <Bearlyn> But a somewhat enjoyable trainwreck
[2022-12-08 22:32:15] <%$PagesInked> it was questionable when it was still on lol
[2022-12-08 22:32:15] <dalma2200> can I ask why didn't you play The sims? I tought that was on the discord for today🤔 I'm just courious😁
[2022-12-08 22:32:16] <%+Becca__06> It’s definitely interesting….
[2022-12-08 22:32:16] <@%brewwin> i feel like glee we're like oh that character wasnt that bad.... *hate crimes someone* oh never mind.
[2022-12-08 22:32:18] <%$cheeruppirate> it was questionable when it aired, the aging isn't the problem
[2022-12-08 22:32:18] <%Jeais> Sometimes I remember my parents watching Glee and it's upsetting
[2022-12-08 22:32:20] <+FranqlysNumber1Fan> I had a Glee purse in 8th grade that said “kiss my gleek” and I still don’t totally understand what the heck that was supposed to mean 😂
[2022-12-08 22:32:29] <AnnetteMaily> What is glee?
[2022-12-08 22:32:31] <%abzbeano> I missed the advent calendars :( what did you get today? 😁
[2022-12-08 22:32:33] <taraaarat> You what has aged well? Veggietales
[2022-12-08 22:32:33] <oxkarolinax> I feel like the jokes were meant to be controversial from the start, so maybe it wasn’t good from the start in that aspect lol
[2022-12-08 22:32:38] <%jo_poop> I'm on season 3 of my rewatch of glee and it certainly is something
[2022-12-08 22:32:41] <@%brewwin> when it aired it was 'edgey'
[2022-12-08 22:32:41] <ashley_rose21> omg I love the dress
[2022-12-08 22:32:44] <%+bigblueframes> lol my phone just told me to watch your stream but i've been here on my laptop since before you went live
[2022-12-08 22:32:46] <%$PagesInked> Its a Ryan Murphy show so
[2022-12-08 22:32:50] <%HopeIsNotaCOA> Glee was indeed pretty cringe a lot of the time. again, I was watching it as an adult, and not an american. but yeah

[2022-12-08 22:32:55] <%$forthehopeofitall> it didnt age well but at the same time it did a lot for diversity on tv back then, was it good? not always but it made a lot of kids feel seen
[2022-12-08 22:32:58] <melzaaaaaa> u were supposed to taste the cookies and craft a snowman too!
[2022-12-08 22:32:58] <loaf_good> Ever interesting and weird show
[2022-12-08 22:33:01] <%$Theresevers> what is Glee even about??
[2022-12-08 22:33:01] <jarduanaodg> it's nice to have you consistently streaming these cozy games, always a streamer to go to
[2022-12-08 22:33:03] <%madflatt> I think one of the only episodes that aged well was Finn’s death
[2022-12-08 22:33:05] <%Jeais> People thank goodness are more aware of how not okay it is now
[2022-12-08 22:33:06] <%+moonpearl33> @dalma2200 She’s not feeling too good and wants some feel good game ing

[2022-12-08 22:33:20] <%+badlamb16> Are we talking about Glee?
[2022-12-08 22:33:23] <%modernwednesday> I could never tell how serious it was meant to be, or if it was satire

[2022-12-08 22:33:30] <%$mia_noelle97> when i watched it as a teenager i didn't realize how questionable it was
[2022-12-08 22:33:31] <mycoolusername> glee is a trainwreck but the songs were really good
[2022-12-08 22:33:38] <%+AndiNOTfromToyStory> okay but i was distraught when corey died, my mom woke me up that morning to tell me before i saw online
[2022-12-08 22:33:43] <+Lkbubble> The Office is another show that would not do well now

[2022-12-08 22:33:48] <$honeyspawn> i feel like i was probably too young to be watching glee when i watched it
[2022-12-08 22:33:50] <%+euphoricmarijn> smooth criminal will live rent free in my mind
[2022-12-08 22:33:50] <AnxiouslyAnIntrovert> I find joy in explaining the icky plot lines to people who have never seen it
[2022-12-08 22:33:51] <%$2Lucky4uM8> euphoria is camp sorry you either get it or you don't
[2022-12-08 22:33:52] <roseyduckling> I started watching glee for the first time and I’ve barely made a dent bc it feels like a fever dream lol it’s so chaotic
[2022-12-08 22:33:53] <%+trixielokidottir> The billy Joel episode was ROUGH

[2022-12-08 22:34:59] <$vcblondie137> It matters to get the favorite gift count for the dreamlight quest - other than that they're happy with any flower.

[2022-12-08 22:35:10] <ebtsmoked> do you remember how many days scar's plant takes to grow?
[2022-12-08 22:35:11] <%jo_poop> @modernwednesday this is the most shocking news I've ever received
[2022-12-08 22:35:14] <%HopeIsNotaCOA> It doesn't really matter. as long as it is a flower they like it.

[2022-12-08 22:35:24] <Suvnah> you can feed more than once a day now too c:
[2022-12-08 22:35:26] <oxkarolinax> color does matter, when they do fly in the round it means it’s they favourite

[2022-12-08 22:51:09] <@%+MrsTomato101814> from what ive read, if you travel forward 1 month, for example, you will always have to be 1 month ahead, and seasonal things will not show up in your game

[2022-12-08 22:51:44] <$Damalise> also respawning items won't respawn until you "catch up"
[2022-12-08 22:51:45] <%afrench1520> do you think they will allow for time travelling in the future?
[2022-12-08 22:51:46] <%+AndiNOTfromToyStory> time traveling is super annoying you have to wait until after the day you time traveled for things to spawn i can’t pick up any herbs

[2022-12-08 22:59:57] <%+ThatRogueVessa> @mamabear171921 That makes sense! Thanks!
[2022-12-08 22:59:58] <@%^Moobot> simsieNo Don't yell! Tone isn't easily conveyed through text. Make suggestions, not demands! simsieNo
[2022-12-08 23:00:02] <%+WillowCreekWanderer> I love the logic of this game where the only way a fish can have a hat on is if it's already wearing the hat when you catch it
[2022-12-08 23:00:03] <@%+MrsTomato101814> this is my punishment for raising a tiny gamer
[2022-12-08 23:00:05] <%+julspy> yea, I've been keeping up with it, apparently the festive fish are available yet
[2022-12-08 23:00:10] <%Jeais> They have tiny Santa hats simsieOMG simsieOMG simsieOMG

[2022-12-08 23:00:29] <oanayu> im pretty sure they're only available this month
[2022-12-08 23:00:39] <%$margteer> I’m going to have to play when I get off work today 😂
[2022-12-08 23:00:42] <loser_2022> why does Donald Duck sounds like an angry cat
[2022-12-08 23:00:44] <%+miss_priya> "festive fish" should be a thing in the sims fishing with seasons. i.e. 'jingle bell fish'
[2022-12-08 23:00:48] <%+stevenfriend> Have u caught any festive fish?
[2022-12-08 23:00:52] <$rabidcherry> Kayla or mods, I'm dumb--how will the submission for the lot tour be like tomorrow?
[2022-12-08 23:00:53] <liagomes29> how long is the wait to get stich??
[2022-12-08 23:00:55] <%+julspy> people haven't figured out if it's a bug or just not out yet
[2022-12-08 23:01:00] <itsrealtoast> Kayla i literally just saw you in a logitech commercial!!!
[2022-12-08 23:01:00] <%$desert_koala94> Its like the coffee isn't available until stitch is here
[2022-12-08 23:01:03] <%+spidergwens> @mrstomato101814 how would you rate mary’s driving? i have fallen off my bed while playing mariokart
[2022-12-08 23:01:06] <+jisvis> you can't catch them yet
[2022-12-08 23:01:08] <%bealines> probably like the candy buckets, and they'll appear closer to christmas
[2022-12-08 23:01:09] <%raegan_eliza> Are you doing the Aurora concert tonight?
[2022-12-08 23:01:10] <oanayu> maybe there's a Christmas specific quest or something or a bug
[2022-12-08 23:01:10] <%Missygirl93> I wonder if  they're rare
[2022-12-08 23:01:10] <%+chelly1987> It’s like the Halloween buckets
[2022-12-08 23:01:10] <%Jeais> I got a red algae but I don't know that that's seasonal or just new
[2022-12-08 23:01:11] <$rabidcherry> I meant on the 10th oops
[2022-12-08 23:01:12] <+NurseWeeb> maybe xmas week?
[2022-12-08 23:01:12] <@%brewwin> the urge to watch every disney/pixar movie is upon me once again
[2022-12-08 23:01:20] <laurel_13> is mod Cristine the same one that has holo taco? because I finally was able to place an order and I've never had nail polish like this! it's Ah-MAZING! so good 👏🙌😂
[2022-12-08 23:01:21] <%Missygirl93> Stitch loves coffee
[2022-12-08 23:01:25] <jennybsweeney> I don’t know how to catch them, but I wonder if it’s the extra special bait? Has anyone tried that?
[2022-12-08 23:01:30] <poetpretzel> i LOVE watching you play this game, the energy is everything
[2022-12-08 23:01:37] <@%+ceesees> @rabidcherry the tours are saturday, you can enter by point redeem and they'll be randomly drawn
[2022-12-08 23:01:37] <%lizzylion572> @Missygirl93 That is both funny and concerning haha
[2022-12-08 23:01:42] <%Missygirl93> Stitch loves coconut cake

[2022-12-08 23:03:33] <@%brewwin> disney japan (disney by the sea) is a bit more geared towards kids but its fun and one of the highest rated theme parks in the world or something
[2022-12-08 23:03:34] <Bearlyn> Denial is the first step of grief
[2022-12-08 23:03:34] <%kayybee_7> It is a characteristic of a Disney girl that you visit more than one Disney location
[2022-12-08 23:03:34] <kingpooh4> as a French person who goes to Disneyland Paris, its pretty cool
[2022-12-08 23:03:36] <$lisa71670> I think she does protest too much  LOL

[2022-12-08 23:24:23] <@%+MrsTomato101814> yeah i'd miss my first week rewards and old star path items too much
[2022-12-08 23:24:25] <Jenni_Zu> @angiesimmer19 Not yet, they want to add that when it comes out I think
[2022-12-08 23:24:27] <penguenya> i would restart if i was done with all the quests and there was no update soon i think
[2022-12-08 23:24:29] <%+justpeggy> I've had to restart twice, because my 4 year old erased my game twice. :/ it was rough lol
[2022-12-08 23:24:30] <%srebecc15> i accidently restarted DDV did right before the update this week and cried, but its kinda fun doing it over
[2022-12-08 23:24:31] <%+julspy> I restarted as well, but just after Halloween, so one dreamlight quest mocks me because I couldn't do it
[2022-12-08 23:24:33] <%pinkpantheroo> i think bc i can move and change everything around freely i dont feel the need to restart it

[2022-12-08 23:24:39] <%+bekah4554> I'm so glad you're playing this game! These are my favorite streams
[2022-12-08 23:24:40] <sinytr> restart new leaf
[2022-12-08 23:24:41] <%justRayxox> Have you caught any of the festive fish yet?
[2022-12-08 23:24:49] <buzz_thebeee> You keep the star path items when you reset!!!
[2022-12-08 23:24:50] <%$SailorScout04> Today I thought I was gonna have to restart my game and I was SO upset
[2022-12-08 23:24:50] <%+julspy> you do keep all the star path items
[2022-12-08 23:24:51] <%+ladycelestius> I hope they'll have a way to do the first star path. I missed most of it.
[2022-12-08 23:24:53] <%dawnpenguin> i think cause animal crossing you get different island structures and here we get the same map
[2022-12-08 23:24:53] <+nixienut> i had to restart as i accidentally glitched it when time travelling in acmh - its been a painful journey back to where i was
[2022-12-08 23:24:58] <kamiskin> I feel like restarting in animal crossing results in less of a net loss than this game
[2022-12-08 23:25:04] <%+justpeggy> yes!! I was thankful for thar!

[2022-12-08 23:26:18] <$2018lauren> @sitdarling it’s blue bubbles on dazzle beach. They’re easier to find at night

[2022-12-08 23:27:12] <%42hitch42> I've caught kingfish with white bubbles, too, so fish all of the spots.

[2022-12-08 23:33:00] <%+snowy_flake> i would’ve gotten a mac if it wasn’t for poor gaming
[2022-12-08 23:33:00] <+NurseWeeb> im a mac lover but admit PC is far better and i LOVE my PC
[2022-12-08 23:33:00] <amandistories> My Mac is brand new so it should work on mine ?
[2022-12-08 23:33:02] <%evemells> windows 4 lyf
[2022-12-08 23:33:02] <$mzgoodlyfe> Anyone get stitch yet??
[2022-12-08 23:33:04] <%$baileycakes215> My 2015 mac is barely running the Sims simsieCowplant
[2022-12-08 23:33:10] <SaysSarcastically> I feel like this game needs time to collect things since it's real time and I'm a once a week gamer. would probably be upset missing all the events
[2022-12-08 23:33:14] <naromori> I only play sims 4 in my mac, it gets hot and crash time by time :')
[2022-12-08 23:33:15] <+NurseWeeb> more for graph9c design\
[2022-12-08 23:33:15] <+beththenerd> macs used to use an intel chip in their computers but apple developed their own chip called the m1 chip so they didn't have to continue to buy intel chips for their products
[2022-12-08 23:33:16] <%afrench1520> im grateful i bought my lenovo and not a mac
[2022-12-08 23:33:19] <%dawnpenguin> mac is good for work but games are really bad
[2022-12-08 23:33:19] <%$Rebecca8221> it so cute
[2022-12-08 23:33:20] <%not_keontae> M1 chips are like the processing thing. Our iPhone have M1 chips too
[2022-12-08 23:33:20] <+bookmoon2> anything but games i feel
[2022-12-08 23:33:21] <%justRayxox> I don't have any problems playing Sims on it
[2022-12-08 23:33:21] <%lizzylion572> @exiztenz1999 2009??? My 2014 is on it's final days lol
[2022-12-08 23:33:21] <%$nuclearself> are there any real benefit to macs? that windows can't do?
[2022-12-08 23:33:22] <%+willisx2dan> honestly, i want one for editing but they are EVIL
[2022-12-08 23:33:24] <cupcakemagic420> I love my Mac but it can be limiting

[2022-12-08 23:33:36] <%Missygirl93> Legacy is dying for certain Mac and Pc users
[2022-12-08 23:33:39] <%lizzylion572> I was a graphic designer so that's why I have mac
[2022-12-08 23:33:42] <PinkyJapan> Mac laptops don't last more than 2 years. I know from experience.

[2022-12-08 23:33:47] <LeeshaYouCray> My Mac is so old I can’t get new sims packs when they come out ☹️☹️☹️
[2022-12-08 23:33:49] <%evemells> pc does it all
[2022-12-08 23:33:55] <%procrasticrafting> @nuclearself a lot of programmers prefer macs
[2022-12-08 23:33:55] <%elizabethschuitema> you could fry an egg on my mac when i play sims
[2022-12-08 23:33:58] <%justRayxox> I made sure to get as much RAM as I possibly could so that it wouldn't be impossible to game on it
[2022-12-08 23:34:00] <%+pinkelfish> i will say, my 2019 mac runs just fine for games. i got mine bc i knew it would last me through four years of an engineering degree
[2022-12-08 23:34:06] <+peachiepie90> I have a 2015 Mac and it’s upgraded spec wise and it runs dreamlight so I’m not sure .

[2022-12-08 23:34:11] <%+julspy> my husband works in tv and it's more that the existing infrastructure is mac
[2022-12-08 23:34:12] <%joakimedlund1> @PinkyJapan had mine for 4 years
[2022-12-08 23:34:13] <%Jeais> I'm a professional full time graphic designer and you could not pay me to go back to Mac
[2022-12-08 23:34:14] <princessraven1997> I have an HP laptop and it’s really good
[2022-12-08 23:34:15] <emilkax00> @PinkyJapan mine is like 10 years old and works great!
[2022-12-08 23:34:17] <%afrench1520> and arent macs like a million dollars compared to pc
[2022-12-08 23:34:18] <%evemells> i love this debate, my photography class used to have it daily
[2022-12-08 23:34:19] <%lizzylion572> The PC screenshot tool is the dumbest thing though
[2022-12-08 23:34:19] <%not_keontae> Yeah no limits on windows
[2022-12-08 23:34:23] <quinntessance> im just too attached to my apple ecosystem
[2022-12-08 23:34:26] <north_cub> my 2019 mac did NOT run games well at all
[2022-12-08 23:34:27] <%+enouemxnt> My editing software works 10x better on my pc than mac and I do plenty of video editing and graphic design
[2022-12-08 23:34:30] <icannottype> generally i love my mac and it works fine for sims
[2022-12-08 23:34:31] <@%chibbylaura> i havent touched this game in literally so long
[2022-12-08 23:34:32] <jennybsweeney> Mmm yeah as a graphic designer I prefer Mac but that’s probably because I was always told it was better for design work
[2022-12-08 23:34:32] <lorettabelleart> i feel like macs had an initial advantage for that but now it's about the same
[2022-12-08 23:34:35] <%$lilolivetrees> overwatch doesnt run on mac
[2022-12-08 23:34:36] <%+brig222> I just checked in the app store and my mac is compatible!!
[2022-12-08 23:34:37] <%lizzylion572> @quinntessance Same
[2022-12-08 23:34:39] <@%+MrsTomato101814> i also wonder if the minimum specs for mac are futureproofed
[2022-12-08 23:34:41] <irenerocharte> my mac plays the sims fine but its newer
[2022-12-08 23:34:42] <PinkyJapan> I've had several crap out after 2 years so I'm just done.
[2022-12-08 23:34:42] <%Missygirl93> DDV won't run on a Mac under 2021
[2022-12-08 23:34:43] <%justRayxox> I just purchased a steam deck to supplement my gaming needs cause a lot of the games I want to play don't have a mac version
[2022-12-08 23:34:46] <+beththenerd> My M1 chip mac is pretty good for the games i do have access to, it even stream well
[2022-12-08 23:34:49] <%+RogueTownie> oooh your house looks nice!
[2022-12-08 23:34:50] <%+calicodoodle> A lot of companies use mac for their employees because apple is good with maintenance and bulk care deals and stuff
[2022-12-08 23:34:50] <%$chwelseaa> you can get an AMAZING gaming computer for less than a macbook lol
[2022-12-08 23:34:51] <%ElixirOfEmotions> @chibbylaura same
[2022-12-08 23:34:52] <%+WillowCreekWanderer> I've always used windows and I simply refuse to learn a new operating system lol
[2022-12-08 23:34:53] <%+snowy_flake> lmao that’s what i have
[2022-12-08 23:34:54] <%Jeais> My last work Mac was more than $2k at the time and it was so unstable running just Adobe Illustrator
[2022-12-08 23:34:54] <%+katdem1222> My mac has been good for getting me through college but I am really excited for a pc
[2022-12-08 23:34:54] <+bookmoon2> that's kind of what i meant: you can do most on both, but games are better on windows
[2022-12-08 23:34:55] <%$nuclearself> i really like apple phones but find macs insufferable
[2022-12-08 23:34:56] <%$paliPhD> windows is bae and so much cheaper for better specs
[2022-12-08 23:34:57] <%not_keontae> There was some CC I couldn’t get cuz I used to play on MAC
[2022-12-08 23:34:59] <%joakimedlund1> anything but mac
[2022-12-08 23:35:00] <%+RogueTownie> i need to spend more time decorating my house

[2022-12-08 23:35:08] <%$chwelseaa> for ease of use with like phones and stuff it's great but is that convenience worth it
[2022-12-08 23:35:11] <%miltsuh> I would say programmers prefer Linux @procrasticrafting
[2022-12-08 23:35:11] <%$iHyetta> if you own a lot of apple products then the integration with a mac is wonderful
[2022-12-08 23:35:12] <%+ThatgirlChristine> isn't Mac made by Apple?
[2022-12-08 23:35:14] <%$mrhjcbs> The price of apple products makes me want to cry honestly
[2022-12-08 23:35:18] <%Jeais> I'm much happier with an IPS display gaming laptop for design
[2022-12-08 23:35:18] <%$jenniferlundqvist> yeah and they are so expensive
[2022-12-08 23:35:21] <+peachiepie90> I use a Mac because it just seems easier for graphic design
[2022-12-08 23:35:23] <%+willisx2dan> @ThatgirlChristine yep
[2022-12-08 23:35:27] <%+seykou> Macs are just not made for gaming, which is fine but if you wanna game they’re not ir
[2022-12-08 23:35:34] <%plantsy> got a mac with a student discount for school and then dropped out the next semester.. haha .. pain
[2022-12-08 23:35:39] <amandistories> My Mac is good for school and it runs the sims extremely well
[2022-12-08 23:35:39] <%lizzylion572> @peachiepie90 It depends. It really is easier for that though

[2022-12-08 23:36:03] <casually_maddie> I have an hp envy and it’s touch screen so it’s kinda like a mac for graphic design but it’s also pretty good for gaming like it runs the sims 3 fairly well I’m ngl

[2022-12-08 23:40:32] <%justRayxox> I have started feeling old this year. When it's cold, I wake up with a weird clicking in my left knee
[2022-12-08 23:40:35] <@%ItIsDanya> I feel like buzz wouldnt be able to carry the things you mine js
[2022-12-08 23:40:43] <@%+MrsTomato101814> @ItIsDanya a valid point

[2022-12-08 23:40:50] <%+BatsBeanie413> You can not make Ariel fish which makes several
[2022-12-08 23:40:52] <poetpretzel> have you set ariel as a buddy yet?
[2022-12-08 23:40:57] <%+BatsBeanie413> Sense*
[2022-12-08 23:40:57] <%modernwednesday> the plant watering spots not always being the same stresses me out
[2022-12-08 23:40:58] <%+flimsynatalia> i placed buzz's rv behind remy's restaurant as he let him stay for some time
[2022-12-08 23:40:59] <%Jeais> If it makes sense to you then it's easier to remember too
[2022-12-08 23:41:00] <%+yanjii> aight! thank you!

[2022-12-08 23:41:11] <%$jenniferlundqvist> yeah, I mostly put mining, gardening and fishing since I often don't use a buddy for the other two
[2022-12-08 23:41:13] <@%ItIsDanya> just dont set ariel as fishing..... that sounds mean
[2022-12-08 23:41:16] <sorecuupid> what time is it there btw
[2022-12-08 23:41:17] <@%+MrsTomato101814> i made scar a fishing buddy because i knew he loves to eat fish
[2022-12-08 23:41:19] <bearinthebigblue> this game kinda reminds me of stardew
[2022-12-08 23:41:22] <%$heIIomego> Little me played the sims life stories exclusively on an HP laptop. For years I could only play with no more than 3 sims in the household and only one story houses or the game would glitch horribly 💀

[2022-12-08 23:41:38] <%+flimsynatalia> that is hilarious
[2022-12-08 23:41:38] <%$paliPhD> I really wanted to set her as fishing and was so disappointed
[2022-12-08 23:41:39] <xMikaylaMariex> it's because she is a fish
[2022-12-08 23:41:40] <%+yanjii> they force you to be proper lol
[2022-12-08 23:41:43] <%justRayxox> What friendship level does Ariel need to be to get her legs
[2022-12-08 23:41:43] <%lizzylion572> What if you...give a toy to woody...how would that work hahaha
[2022-12-08 23:41:44] <mycoolusername> you want ariel to fish her own people?
[2022-12-08 23:41:44] <%$nuclearself> could you imagine a fish fishing for fish
[2022-12-08 23:41:47] <%+snowy_flake> they blocked it to prevent people like you /lh
[2022-12-08 23:41:47] <@%+MrsTomato101814> but eric can???? honestly thats worse
[2022-12-08 23:41:51] <+indigoeternity> flounder is her best friend
[2022-12-08 23:41:53] <$sianamber> she still cheers you on fishing though
[2022-12-08 23:41:55] <$bts_loona> fish eat fish too whaaat
[2022-12-08 23:41:56] <oxkarolinax> but she’s happy when we catch fish next to her
[2022-12-08 23:41:56] <rica_hiddlefield> imagine finding nemo characters as fishing buddies oof
[2022-12-08 23:41:57] <@%mivyard> hihi

[2022-12-08 23:42:08] <%plantsy> that would be like making the beast hunt for bigfoot
[2022-12-08 23:42:09] <%+willisx2dan> Ariel as a gardening buddy would be cute
[2022-12-08 23:42:09] <@%^Moobot> simsieNo NO, DO THIS! CHANGE THIS! EWWWW! Backseat gaming is NEVER allowed. Suggestions are always appreciated, but do not attempt to make demands or force Kayla to do anything. There is a difference between friendly suggestions and aggressive demands.
