[2022-12-17 11:56:44] <@^StreamElements> I'm pretty sure fucken every guy has tried their own fucken cum. It's just a curiosity thing man, I was curious what it was like.

Alright, I was thirteen years old, I'd just discovered wanking, I was like "hmm I wonder what my load tastes like", so I had a little taste, alright. Don't fucking judge me dude, I reckon half of you fuckers did it man.

[2022-12-17 12:16:41] <midtiercabbage> To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Rick's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes
[2022-12-17 12:16:44] <+Mildly_Entertaining> to be fair you do have to be very intelligent to understand the subtle nuances of the Richard and Mortimer extended multi-media entertainment uniiverse

[2022-12-17 14:54:59] <Hooloo25> IDK if they changed it but when I last played multiplayer there were individual pods of zombies for each player, so when players were grouped there was a lot more, less when we spread out

Don't fucking judge me dude, I reckon half of you fuckers did it man.

[2022-12-17 16:14:29] <@%+Adamy2> they grew up playing league and stopped developing socially because of it

With a couple of hours (max) and willingness to learn, you can install a new toilet yourself so you can save on installation costs! Are you nervous about removing an old toilet and installing a new one? I get it. I felt that way before we did it for the first time (especially since we only had ONE toilet in that house–we really couldn't mess it up, lol)!
