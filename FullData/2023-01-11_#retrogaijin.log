[2023-01-11 10:56:29] <+NamelessNamek> not so much regressed...but the shift from Crash (pure latformer) to Jak (Platformer with more story/gunplay in sequels) to Uncharted (mostly gunplay/story, some platforming) to Last of Us (Mostly story/some gunplay, no platforming) is pretty crazy
[2023-01-11 10:56:32] <@%Gupumai> @NallePops it's a fun one, but I had times of almost giving up

[2023-01-11 11:41:07] <+Ercomann> This is one of my top 5 games of all time
[2023-01-11 11:41:13] <%Rulyz_> They really did
[2023-01-11 11:41:14] <$OnlinePhenome> WAshed up streamer widepeepoSad
[2023-01-11 11:41:14] <phrenelith> 2nd one is great
[2023-01-11 11:41:16] <D1V1D3DxFLASH1> and then sly cooper
[2023-01-11 11:41:16] <@%+Sotenbori> Just the PS2 ones
[2023-01-11 11:41:17] <@%Gupumai> Yep
[2023-01-11 11:41:18] <Despatche> there are like three times as many r&c games lol
[2023-01-11 11:41:23] <%SurrealTiggi> Yikers, that’s true tho
[2023-01-11 11:41:27] <undeadcastle> What about crash bandicoot?
[2023-01-11 11:41:28] <SabolToothTiger> just play up your arsenal
[2023-01-11 11:41:28] <@%+Jonno107> The PS5 one is fun
[2023-01-11 11:41:35] <+Vork88> retro how about sly cooper?
[2023-01-11 11:41:38] <!%Stoudman> did you ever do the remaster of the Spongebob game?
[2023-01-11 11:41:43] <%+RubyRose2077> Jak 2 was 2 years later, 2003
[2023-01-11 11:41:48] <Bribe_Guntails> Ratchet 3 is a good place to start
[2023-01-11 11:41:48] <@%+Sotenbori> You can start with just the PS2 games, then move from there if you like it enough
[2023-01-11 11:41:52] <D1V1D3DxFLASH1> all for one is the my hero spin off
[2023-01-11 11:41:52] <+captain_obviouse> The old ones are best
[2023-01-11 11:41:54] <$AkameOda> 2 is Going Commando & that's the best one

[2023-01-11 11:42:01] <%SurrealTiggi> Yeah just be selective, I don’t think it’s a hugely overarching story where you *have* to play all the games
[2023-01-11 11:42:02] <Despatche> the original series is the first game, then going commando, then up your arsenal, then deadlocked

[2023-01-11 13:16:22] <SquidwardTheHandsome> playstation's tiered subscription is kinda ass, they need to take lessons from gamepass
[2023-01-11 13:16:23] <+solidpeyo> that is why the PS3 store is betterz they have all these games not behind a subscription bullshit
