[2022-12-08 01:05:16] <%bodied_corphish> it was still challenging
[2022-12-08 01:05:32] <beegbeegboiboi> Use God Mode if you want to complete the story quickly
[2022-12-08 01:05:32] <DedlokPM> IIRC God Mode is just Easy mode

[2022-12-08 01:06:11] <WitherBlaster> God Mode gives you a little bit of defense that gets slightly better every time you die. I believe it's specifically +2% less damage every death, maxing out at 80%.
[2022-12-08 01:06:14] <!%Nastychain> scammed
[2022-12-08 01:06:14] <Darkmetalslime> Thats just a normal room

[2022-12-08 01:06:22] <SecretAgentSteve> It's max health though, not just healing.

[2022-12-08 01:33:50] <LazySamurai> yea you have the hangover damage over time
[2022-12-08 01:33:50] <%BLACOZ> fountains can be found in random areas and at the end of every floor after a boss
[2022-12-08 01:33:50] <Angry_By_Default> u get a fountain after u beat each area @snuffy
[2022-12-08 01:33:51] <%MataNui95> where your sword PauseChamp
[2022-12-08 01:33:51] <KolinarK> 2
[2022-12-08 01:33:52] <%a_cool_tunafish> The 2nd one is good
[2022-12-08 01:33:52] <Voncullinator46> you get one after a boss, so you probably won't see one for several attempts
[2022-12-08 01:33:53] <%bodied_corphish> yeah you have hangover on your attacks
[2022-12-08 01:33:54] <%CorneredBadger13> full heal is always nice to have but theres like 2 per level ish
[2022-12-08 01:33:54] <%+UnlistedNinja> I'd take the fountain
[2022-12-08 01:33:55] <%tropicalshark> sodaHmm thinking of the combos is the fun part
[2022-12-08 01:33:55] <SilverFeng> attacks give hangover now
[2022-12-08 01:33:55] <%+redlock_tm> yea 2 is a nice combo
[2022-12-08 01:33:56] <%hydroponicmaple> i
[2022-12-08 01:33:58] <MrPot4to> you have the thing on your regular attack yeah
[2022-12-08 01:33:59] <%tommyp915> strong drink is pretty useful early
[2022-12-08 01:33:59] <dimitri_kraftman> fountain is good early
[2022-12-08 01:34:01] <%JTBman> yeah 2
[2022-12-08 01:34:03] <%hydroponicmaple> 2 i think
[2022-12-08 01:34:03] <%$PinkSupervisor> fountains you see after each area boss
[2022-12-08 01:34:06] <rymarzo> healing one is probably better
[2022-12-08 01:34:06] <ProfessionalFool1> they are also a random chance in some rooms
[2022-12-08 01:34:06] <+braincraft> You only get fountains if you buy the upgrade. It's not very useful right now.

[2022-12-08 01:34:21] <%hydroponicmaple> in another room
[2022-12-08 01:34:23] <%$PinkSupervisor> you have to beat the boss of the area first

[2022-12-08 22:06:34] <%Hykon> elisSit me waiting on brackenhide rares to spawn
[2022-12-08 22:10:05] <!%Nastychain> i havent logged in in 3 days
[2022-12-08 22:16:44] <%Hykon> good choice.
[2022-12-08 22:20:53] <!%Nastychain> blizzard is stupid for not enabling m+ this week
[2022-12-08 22:33:07] <%Hykon> it's the normal 2wk period of just letting ppl level at their own pace
[2022-12-08 22:33:30] <%Hykon> for anyone that plays a good chunk it'll always get boring near the end of the first week
[2022-12-08 22:34:01] <%Hykon> and they dont want ppl outgearing normal raid with m+ so they can't release it early
[2022-12-08 22:34:33] <%Hykon> can't wait for raid tho so all this rare/wq gear can go extinct
[2022-12-08 22:40:01] <!%Nastychain> i thought m+ was always out on release
[2022-12-08 22:41:00] <!%Nastychain> or maybe it released 1 week later
[2022-12-08 22:42:16] <!%Nastychain> idk i remember in legion and bfa i played for a month straight :/
[2022-12-08 23:01:57] <%Hykon> m+ has always released with the raid release
[2022-12-08 23:01:59] <%Hykon> but was capped first week
[2022-12-08 23:02:07] <%Hykon> there has always been a 2wk period of no raid/m+/rated pvp
[2022-12-08 23:02:34] <%Hykon> legion and bfa had AP grinds so there was technically always something to do
[2022-12-08 23:02:43] <%Hykon> even if very small
[2022-12-08 23:08:32] <!%Nastychain> hmm
[2022-12-08 23:09:52] <!%Nastychain> 2 weeks is still so long
[2022-12-08 23:14:24] <%Hykon> yeah if you play a lot it feels like an eternity, but it gives the 1h a night max andys a chance to experience the game
[2022-12-08 23:21:51] <!%Nastychain> if you have 1 hour a night you might as well not even play imo
[2022-12-08 23:23:42] <%Hykon> i agree but hey ppl like what they like
[2022-12-08 23:23:54] <%Hykon> some ppl unironically login to wow to do petbattles
[2022-12-08 23:23:59] <%Hykon> when pokemon exists
[2022-12-08 23:29:03] <!%Nastychain> im convinced those people are just blizzard maximalists
[2022-12-08 23:29:27] <!%Nastychain> they do pet battles in wow instead of pokemon only because its a blizzard game
[2022-12-08 23:29:48] <!%Nastychain> and its crazy because blizzard caters to these people the most
