[2022-12-26 14:46:26] <1stiefel> It helps you get used to it

[2022-12-26 16:47:17] <DASBUSEN> you channeled your inner scav slav LUL
[2022-12-26 16:47:18] <+cantgetriight> most of the pmcs should be gone and player scavs with bad guns will be there, so it should be easier to win gunfights
[2022-12-26 16:47:25] <barenski11> i member gingy yelled jopa it was awesome

[2022-12-26 16:47:34] <dicencozy> i think interchange is the best map to learn on because good loot is spread evenly across the whole map and you can almost always escape a fight because the sightlines are so short

[2022-12-26 16:48:20] <Official_SylaR> @cantgetriight this is great advice! That’s how I got above 20% survival rate LUL
[2022-12-26 16:48:21] <+cantgetriight> interchange is a confusing map
[2022-12-26 16:48:31] <yaboy_chonkzilla_jhonson> nha go customs first
[2022-12-26 16:48:34] <yaboy_chonkzilla_jhonson> to learn
[2022-12-26 16:48:35] <DASBUSEN> @dicencozy but youll also take a chance getting caught down a long hall. and wrap arounds

[2022-12-26 16:49:08] <gucci_reseller> personally woods was my hometown when i started playin
[2022-12-26 16:49:11] <scotsm3n> Woods is the best
[2022-12-26 16:49:17] <DASBUSEN> @DASBUSEN absolutely, im officially a fan hahah
[2022-12-26 16:49:26] <%+ogjoker88> @cantgetriight as a new player yes it is
[2022-12-26 16:49:32] <%ArsonLt> perfect time to play woods
[2022-12-26 16:49:35] <+Preahlany> us chads will gladly eat up those timmies learning the map KEKW KEKW
[2022-12-26 16:49:50] <+babaoma> first map i learned was reserve
[2022-12-26 16:49:56] <+cantgetriight> and the sight lines from dorms and stronghold are ridiculous
[2022-12-26 16:50:03] <Official_SylaR> I’m sooo sad I’m going on vacation to Florida in a few hours. Going to miss w1pe Sadge

[2022-12-26 16:50:45] <+Clingsama> Woods is heavily mined though, and one mistep = dead new player. Shoreline is fine, but is very open and also very hard to know where you can and can't loot.  Customs has a lot of secret spots, lots of scavs, and easy extracts to find.
[2022-12-26 16:50:48] <%+McnuggetSama> Every map sucks when your a timmy with no map knowledge
[2022-12-26 16:50:50] <+ReK_42> The only problem is woods is super hard to navigate without the compass when you're learning it

[2022-12-26 16:51:09] <+KDN_R3aper> WHAT? tasking takes you through all the pieces of the game, hello?
[2022-12-26 16:51:11] <yaboy_chonkzilla_jhonson> so we get SOT straight after the wype ?
[2022-12-26 16:51:14] <Jonrskittles> k
[2022-12-26 16:51:26] <+ben_nanaa> you learn maps by tasking
[2022-12-26 16:51:35] <+cantgetriight> if you try to task on reserve, you will die 100%
[2022-12-26 16:51:36] <%+ogjoker88> @KDN_R3aper Even pest says dont worry about questing as a new player
[2022-12-26 16:51:38] <%Mess1as> you don't really
[2022-12-26 16:51:40] <%Mess1as> but it';s good
[2022-12-26 16:51:41] <%+FzStryker> totally agree..my first two wipes didnt task at all.. learned the basics..
[2022-12-26 16:51:43] <+ScottishWarriors> @KDN_R3aper we built different bruh
[2022-12-26 16:51:43] <+cantgetriight> if you dont know the map
[2022-12-26 16:51:46] <+ben_nanaa> i know what your saying
[2022-12-26 16:51:46] <DASBUSEN> if you dont know maps youre going to have a bad time trying to quest as a new player
[2022-12-26 16:51:48] <%Crawlern> LISTEN TO WHAT SHE SAYS
[2022-12-26 16:51:48] <amadiaho> unless youy're a chad from playing fps games
[2022-12-26 16:51:51] <jayblisssss> the quests in this game teach you this game 100%
[2022-12-26 16:51:54] <+HellsingsDomain> is day 8 still in effect?
[2022-12-26 16:51:55] <Official_SylaR> My first w1pe I got to level 15 without even knowing there were quests. There is so much to leadn
[2022-12-26 16:52:03] <+Epix49> i disagree
[2022-12-26 16:52:06] <+cantgetriight> having to circle back will get you killed
[2022-12-26 16:52:07] <+MrFlubberMuffin> tasking doesnt teach shit other than hate going to the quest areas
[2022-12-26 16:52:09] <+Epix49> but alas
[2022-12-26 16:52:10] <%Ralph1e_> immediately tasking is why people get their dick kicked in when they start
[2022-12-26 16:52:13] <%+OR10N867> Questing didn't tell me anything about the map LUL
[2022-12-26 16:52:15] <+ItzToxicTV> just explore the maps w/o quests
[2022-12-26 16:52:22] <+peejayggs> you learn specific parts of a map by questing, better off having a map open on a second monitor and learning landmarks
[2022-12-26 16:52:25] <RegHex> when you task you run into other people instead of just learning the map
[2022-12-26 16:52:25] <DASBUSEN> @Ralph1e_ this lol
[2022-12-26 16:52:25] <jayblisssss> so you agree PixelBob
[2022-12-26 16:52:26] <%+taintsniffer609> you gotta know the maps to know where to go for the quest
[2022-12-26 16:52:27] <Cormical> quest areas are extremely congested too.
[2022-12-26 16:52:30] <top_man> nah that's not really a thing, bring up map on other monitor or phone and walk around, you learn the map by getting familiar with it not by questing in it, you'll have easier time questing after too
[2022-12-26 16:52:36] <epicshoo> yeah the game got easier when i stopped tasking and just learned the maps using an online map
[2022-12-26 16:52:36] <+cantgetriight> pull up a game map on your phone ppl
[2022-12-26 16:52:47] <Jonrskittles> yeah i started learning maps instead of mechanics just so i could get a basis
[2022-12-26 16:52:50] <+KDN_R3aper> just open mapgenie on second monitor or phone? you dont have to learn it by walking around everywhere
[2022-12-26 16:52:55] <SomNyDays> I learned map first
[2022-12-26 16:52:59] <+ScottishWarriors> who has played 1 map for a year
[2022-12-26 16:52:59] <barenski11> he he i only play woods too
[2022-12-26 16:53:00] <+Preahlany> great teacher <3
[2022-12-26 16:53:01] <Jonrskittles> so far i only know woods and factory tho lol
[2022-12-26 16:53:02] <+JohnWhiffff> I learn maps in offline mode

[2022-12-26 16:53:09] <AndolaJackson> lighthouse is a prime example you cant just run into the depots
[2022-12-26 16:53:09] <SomNyDays> then I learned Hideout while questing
[2022-12-26 16:53:09] <+Clingsama> But they learn the map because they have to go there for tasks though.  You go to new maps because your quests move you there.
[2022-12-26 16:53:10] <+Tio_barba> its hard to learn pvp
[2022-12-26 16:53:11] <skipper_iv> There is offline mode as well, so its easy to learn them
[2022-12-26 16:53:21] <+teammates89> If you are questing without map knowledge it adds a distraction having to look at the map and not knowing where threats can come from.
[2022-12-26 16:53:22] <TwiistedMisfit> im not even new and i just loot and survive for flea sell all hideout and quest stuff make loads of roubles then ill quest knowing i can afford new gear
[2022-12-26 16:53:23] <+HellsingsDomain> Just download overwolf and use game maps on it. You can get an ingame overlay
[2022-12-26 16:53:23] <%+OR10N867> I learned a couple maps before I bought the game LUL
[2022-12-26 16:53:27] <yaboy_chonkzilla_jhonson> just cheat its ok
[2022-12-26 16:53:28] <DASBUSEN> opening a map doesnt mean youll know where to go, you gotta explore. you need to learn landmarks etc.. otherwise youll make circles and walk on landmines
[2022-12-26 16:53:30] <+T_Phil87> gotta learn maps first, youre giving good advice
[2022-12-26 16:53:34] <+bratork> Guess different people learn the game doing different stuff
[2022-12-26 16:53:39] <BasicG5> I did offline raids to learn maps then scav on that map to figure out the hot spots then started pmc on that map.
[2022-12-26 16:53:41] <%+FzStryker> map knowledge really helps
[2022-12-26 16:53:42] <+Tio_barba> it they realease arena soon, it wont be a problem
[2022-12-26 16:53:48] <%ArsonLt> if youre new get the shooting range ASAP so you can test guns for their recoil and to test builds

[2022-12-26 16:54:15] <+KDN_R3aper> i just cant agree with "hey learn the game by NOT doing the main thing that levels you up and teaches you things"
[2022-12-26 16:54:17] <+BDebz> offline mode can help as well
[2022-12-26 16:54:24] <+gironimo01> @Gingy learning gunplay is also a good idea on offline factory right now
[2022-12-26 16:54:25] <Cormical> Moving around a map is a lot easier when you're not forced to go to parts of it for a quest

[2022-12-26 16:54:47] <DASBUSEN> for those saying pop a map and go are just looking to pvp and get their ass whooped because they wont know where the locations are, its okay let em learn lol

[2022-12-26 16:57:02] <+babaoma> i learned it the best when i was questing because i had to walk over the map to the quests and to the exits

[2022-12-26 16:57:30] <DASBUSEN> yeah but the gear fear is a whole process that takes time on its own lol
[2022-12-26 16:57:30] <+Evi1mojo> There is ALWAYS MORE gear to be had
[2022-12-26 16:57:31] <Cormical> your good gear is only good on your body. it does nothing in your stash.

[2022-12-26 16:57:41] <+TheDyl> try to play with a more experience player too so they can give you tips that arent so common

[2022-12-26 16:57:54] <+ReK_42> idk I think it depends on the person. Tasking gives a goal and a sense of progression, which can be important to keep a new player interested

[2022-12-26 21:27:36] <@%novusxpayne> and the week of server issues at the beginning of wipe could get sorted and not affect drops

[2022-12-26 21:28:05] <CaerusBlue> like 'oh we saw the aug and the smg and the smoke nade' and just like idk
[2022-12-26 21:28:07] <@%novusxpayne> if they only added emergency lights like you would find in every mall it would be much better
[2022-12-26 21:28:08] <+Chaotic15> @Gingy if you dont mind could you post your video settings and nvidia control panel settings please
