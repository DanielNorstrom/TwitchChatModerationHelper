[2023-01-02 12:16:39] <+averagecronos> more ads than streamers

[2023-01-02 12:16:54] <%MitosisDNB> nah, but i think prime will be binned. subs do enough
[2023-01-02 12:16:54] <%Jacobian1979> Doubtful.... ads wont make enough money to keep the service running
[2023-01-02 12:16:58] <@%Breakspear> if you can't be arsed watching a 30 second advert, then I don't think you want to watch the streamer at all
[2023-01-02 12:16:59] <%+cl0udbear> That'd be a bold move given that advertising becomes less effective, and thus less profitable, as time goes by.
[2023-01-02 12:17:04] <@%sRede> you'll never convince me that joining a stream and getting 30s and no ads after is worse than possible joining at the start of a 3 min ad block or missing action later because they play auto ads

[2023-01-02 12:18:36] <%+LiamDubheadScott> Youtube is the king for horrendous ads too
[2023-01-02 12:18:42] <@%sRede> twitch had a feature where you were guaranteed no ads for a min through the directory, but people cried about the autoplay Shruge
[2023-01-02 12:18:42] <%xsess> Honestly fine with the total amount of ads on twitch. But hitting a wall of prerolls, or even a single one when checking what a streamer i dont sub to is up to, just shows how bad twitch is as a platform
[2023-01-02 12:18:50] <%svekky> a sub is just a follow and new upload notification
[2023-01-02 12:18:51] <@%Breakspear> I go on YouTube and get rammed with more ads, but still stick it out. also, if 30s is too long, then you need to sort your priorities out

[2023-01-02 12:34:44] <cybermyk> @BreaK There's an idea, Tarkov while eating breakfast for 12 hours with drops!
[2023-01-02 12:34:50] <+Malice6T9> Breakfast should be served all day
[2023-01-02 12:34:51] <%+tsarlloyd> Breakfasts overrated

[2023-01-02 12:34:54] <%RedRuM_85> think the only maccies i've had in the last 2 years has been breakfasts
[2023-01-02 12:35:00] <%nick_mitsh1> no cheese though cheese on breakfast turns you into gremlinS
[2023-01-02 12:35:00] <@%Breakspear> Fry up is godly

[2023-01-02 12:35:19] <@%Breakspear> Full English Breakfast> Roast Dinner
[2023-01-02 12:35:25] <%LiamG> the raids are very good if you can get them by being live at 1am
[2023-01-02 12:35:30] <shaggy_steve> Essentially all the "people" that have drops are hosting/raiding each other
[2023-01-02 12:35:31] <%kleier> that's a tough call Breakspear
[2023-01-02 12:35:31] <%+LiamDubheadScott> @Breakspear hard agree. Roasts are mediocre at best
[2023-01-02 12:35:34] <Nine_One_Six> Full English > other food
[2023-01-02 12:35:34] <%LiamG> even the ads runs would be a nice chunk of change
[2023-01-02 12:35:38] <%nick_mitsh1> confirmed @breakspear but my beef roasts come close
[2023-01-02 12:35:51] <%Arctic_Dwarf> you got raided the other day didnt you

[2023-01-02 13:09:41] <@%GreggStrat> @GreggStrat They had like 10 minute sections of an actor pretending to be a scav. Just little skits

[2023-01-02 15:06:52] <+wuddeh> crossing again :D
[2023-01-02 15:06:54] <%Hopsecution> instead of auto servers, manually click the ones that matter
[2023-01-02 15:07:16] <Wheelson105> scavs have to join an existing pmc raid. so long queues are lack of servers, they should just generate a new server after 6 minutes of matching imo, regardless if theres a pmc server
[2023-01-02 15:07:17] <%+Docdude83> Anyone else finding player scavs very unfriendly this wipe?

[2023-01-02 16:24:27] <%+ASCanaris> @BreaK  I did that once on CoD4, was getting shat on by someone and called hacks.  Turned out he was a pro player...
[2023-01-02 16:24:30] <BadTimber> The PUBG hacker detective days were pretty fun though.
[2023-01-02 16:24:31] <%Fannydoor> Nerdge any fellow hackerman researchers?
[2023-01-02 16:24:39] <Crowtein_> scavs are definitely hacking though
[2023-01-02 16:24:48] <%noize> !playlist
[2023-01-02 16:24:51] <g0dilla> why do we call them hacker when all they do is being the cheater using a hackers tools?
[2023-01-02 16:24:52] <%Lemings> PatientZ Probably for the better, maybe they would do something about it LUL
[2023-01-02 16:25:09] <%+Jes_762> Scavs are literal aimbots.
[2023-01-02 16:25:29] <%ThinnishExpert> @Jes_762 technically correct!  LUL

[2023-01-02 16:26:38] <%+Jes_762> Red Dead online has a huge problem with cheaters atm. Apparently the “mods” were released online for free. So the community has a problem of calling them “modders”; I just call them cheaters.

[2023-01-02 18:46:02] <%MyApolloGees> viewer numbers mean better potential sponsors during times like these too, if say theres a big spike and you can prove it during drop times ect

I don't even play this game but I still enjoy watching it and the interaction of the community. The meta for being a massively successful streamer isn't this type of content unfortunately and things like justchatting with whacky personalities are where it's at. There are a few great outliers like shroud but you know what I mean.  @BreaK
