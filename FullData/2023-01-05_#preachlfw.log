[2023-01-05 08:47:52] <%TheRealJinjix> Bwop TeaTime -> Ready for some M'F'in GW2 today!
[2023-01-05 08:48:56] <%Zeroslayer> Good morning @TheRealJinjix Bwop
[2023-01-05 08:49:03] <%Zeroslayer> Got my game ready for today! Bwop
[2023-01-05 08:49:31] <%Zeroslayer> Finally figured out how to setup gshade to only put shaders on the game and not the UI Bwop
[2023-01-05 08:49:39] <%TheRealJinjix> Just before DF I capped a GW2 character... but then stopped to play DF, and never got back into it.
[2023-01-05 08:50:25] <%Zeroslayer> Oh and I finally figured out why I couldn't use gshade with the mount addon as well on steam.
[2023-01-05 08:50:42] <%Zeroslayer> It was basically because steam didn't have read permissions to the gshade folder KEKW
[2023-01-05 08:51:27] <%Zeroslayer> I can 100% recommend the mount wheel addon for the game... or just keybind the mounts anyways Bwop
[2023-01-05 08:52:55] <%Zeroslayer> The only real reason I use gshade is to have a sharper image because the game normally looks quite blurry on new hardware compared to back when it released.
[2023-01-05 08:54:52] <%Zeroslayer> Oh yeah I think they start you out with a raptor mount now. So you don't have to get it in the first mission of PoF.
[2023-01-05 08:55:11] <%Zeroslayer> Cus not having the raptor will make the game feel old af now.

[2023-01-05 08:58:38] <%bAssackward> coxSeafood coxWiggle
[2023-01-05 08:59:08] <Dreion> I have my mount keybinds on Numpad for GW2
[2023-01-05 08:59:22] <Dreion> I don't really use it for anything else in the game
[2023-01-05 08:59:38] <%Zeroslayer> Well that's one way to use it Bwop
[2023-01-05 09:00:00] <%Zeroslayer> I just use the mount wheel addon and bind it to my usual mount keybind in other games.

[2023-01-05 09:36:31] <%Shelana95> and an  Engineer in and out of game ;)
[2023-01-05 09:36:38] <%Criptonix100> @Preachlfw if you want to be a Dark Knight try Necro Reaper spec it got buffed :P
[2023-01-05 09:36:45] <%ravenribb> Wodiin pepeD PepoDance
[2023-01-05 09:37:10] <%ravenribb> can't wait to see all GW2 mentors now
[2023-01-05 09:37:13] <%tazman524> I dont know the classes but mike will probably pick the warrior looking one if there is one KEKW
[2023-01-05 09:37:14] <%Criptonix100> @Shelana95 Mesmer Mirage for Mike PepeLaugh
[2023-01-05 09:37:19] <~%+Preachlfw> just hopinh no Lalas!
[2023-01-05 09:37:19] <%Wodiin> Dont listen to anyone and just choose one that looks cool.
[2023-01-05 09:37:20] <%+Miss_Kas> @ravenribb KEKW
[2023-01-05 09:37:22] <%Shelana95> oh hell no xD
[2023-01-05 09:37:33] <%Criptonix100> KEKW no lalas he says

[2023-01-05 09:37:49] <%Thelete> PepeLaugh
[2023-01-05 09:37:55] <%ravenribb> let's just say Mike, you wish it had lalas
[2023-01-05 09:38:02] <%ravenribb> :)
[2023-01-05 09:38:03] <%Wodiin> @Preachlfw GW2 lalas are full on nerds with huge ears. More like if gnomes and goblins were the same race.
[2023-01-05 09:38:12] <%Criptonix100> either way with the level booster he can atleast "try" all classes at core level
[2023-01-05 09:38:13] <%Shelana95> @Preachlfw I will say tho, that it doess not all make sense anymore and the classes. so a Mage is melee for exsample. and a warrior could be ranged
[2023-01-05 09:38:38] <%Zeroslayer> Yup
[2023-01-05 09:38:56] <@%Methuzahla> Im a norn
[2023-01-05 09:39:00] <@%Methuzahla> Norn superior race

[2023-01-05 09:39:09] <%Thelete> its a bit like if you took all the specs in wow and just randomized which base class had which spec xD
[2023-01-05 09:39:11] <+Alliopeth> plant people best people \o/
[2023-01-05 09:39:19] <%Shelana95> Small human is big north person ingame
[2023-01-05 09:39:20] <%Criptonix100> I wish they made it so you can also try one of the specs you would like to choose Madge ANet

[2023-01-05 09:39:48] <%DetectiveTalos> my main was a male sylvari aka the one with the best voice acting, but I had so many alts
[2023-01-05 09:39:53] <%Medias> I don't like the running animation of the Norn

[2023-01-05 10:36:03] <Alcarcalimo> Boons and conditions are the equivalent of buffs and debuffs/DoTs in other MMOs. If there are multiple people applying the same boons/conditions, some of them will stack in duration while others stack in intensity.

[2023-01-05 11:07:55] <kalameesjr> it depends on your offhand weapon
[2023-01-05 11:07:56] <Vandristine> 4 and 5 is for off hands, or twohanders
[2023-01-05 11:07:59] <%Puzzleface> they changed it this year so you gett base raptor at lvl 10

[2023-01-05 11:35:49] <+Sekuso> @Preachlfw You can get 100 gems for 30 gold in this game. So doing dungeons at max level will probably let you buy 1-3 of these items a week
[2023-01-05 11:35:49] <Vandristine> account item upgrades are basically the only worthwhile thing
[2023-01-05 11:35:49] <Lctl10> @Fronali hard disagree. even for wow standards.

[2023-01-05 11:35:59] <Roxfear> I love GW2 but the pay 4 convenience in the cash shop is unreasonably high

[2023-01-05 11:36:01] <Hym1R> @fiberpills I don't know much about 2023 GW2 I played at lauch when it was P2P but stoped bc WvWvW was too laggy for by laptop :(
[2023-01-05 11:36:03] <yuiona> its a dye

[2023-01-05 11:36:16] <%Vinestra28> Perma Dye
[2023-01-05 11:36:19] <+Sekuso> yes permanent

[2023-01-05 11:36:19] <Trafikk_> just farm gold.. convert gold to gems.. dont have to spend rl money
[2023-01-05 11:36:19] <+Destrina> Mystic Toilet
[2023-01-05 11:36:19] <CampingPenguin> just farm people and you get everything 4Head
[2023-01-05 11:36:22] <+Sekuso> and can be applied to all pieces
[2023-01-05 11:36:22] <twobiggy> @Roxfear true
[2023-01-05 11:36:22] <ravalesh> this shop is the reason I stopped playing GW2
[2023-01-05 11:36:27] <%trebolf> One time unlock
[2023-01-05 11:36:31] <%+Awerlu> @Fronali Yeah extreme disagree, GW2 is most P2W out of the three.
[2023-01-05 11:36:31] <+Fraky> you can convert ingame gold to gems, at a varying rate
[2023-01-05 11:36:32] <KimekOwnz> all dyes are perma but you can buy them allon player marketplace so its not worth spending real money
[2023-01-05 11:36:33] <%EPBossMan> you can get all of this with in game gold @Preachlfw
[2023-01-05 11:36:33] <Zlynnt> you can buy all the dyes on the trading post, never buy dye kits
[2023-01-05 11:36:33] <mett7> bag slots are must
[2023-01-05 11:36:34] <Kamenwati> @Roxfear But to be fair it's also reasonably easy to earn enough gold in game to buy gems
[2023-01-05 11:36:34] <+aptrist> you can buy dyes off other players and you get free premium ones from birthday rewards per character
[2023-01-05 11:36:34] <Havesh> bank spare is probably the Best investment
[2023-01-05 11:36:35] <allgu> U can by gems with gold
[2023-01-05 11:36:36] <Kohatsune> @Preachlfw they give you a rare dye you can select on your characters birthday each year
[2023-01-05 11:36:37] <%DetectiveTalos> @trebolf same
[2023-01-05 11:36:38] <fiberpills> @preachlfw yep and u can just buy the dyes from auction house
[2023-01-05 11:36:39] <+Wolfiemuzl> The shop in GW2 receives more content then the game itself, sadly
[2023-01-05 11:36:39] <Siggi_EMP> God the descriptions must sound so bad if you don't know the system behind it
[2023-01-05 11:36:43] <iBelg> oof, I know GW2 is a single purchase, but that's a lot stuff you have to buy extra.
[2023-01-05 11:36:44] <yuiona> @Roxfear only saving grace is that you can actually buy gems with gold. i didnt spend a dime and have all the convenience stuff in the shop
[2023-01-05 11:36:47] <wowmuchtwitcher> you can farm gold and convert to gems though so you never need to pay real money
[2023-01-05 11:36:53] <%+Juskr> the shop doesnt look that terrible at first sight, just really not happy with a quest making you open it, kinda scummy

[2023-01-05 11:37:11] <brucemalt> @iBelg it's not really like that, you can play fine without visiting the shop once.
[2023-01-05 11:37:12] <NikeGipple> combact music
[2023-01-05 11:37:13] <BluSubway> keep in mind most of the p2w is justifiable to the playerbase since they've been playing for 10 years

[2023-01-05 11:37:14] <Fronali> @iBelg you dont "have" to buy anything
[2023-01-05 11:37:15] <Zlynnt> @iBelg most of that shit is useless tbh
[2023-01-05 11:37:20] <%Geri_0123> @Fronali it's on the same level of wow, you can buy everything with gold (even raid clears)

[2023-01-05 11:37:24] <+chaosemperordragoneote> honestly the game is a one-time buy. Its not subscription based and you get a quality game. So having an ingameshop aint bad

[2023-01-05 11:41:51] <annie_sullivan1962> The original human lore by the original writers; the humans are a race of demons that obviously come from the mist, and all of their magic is powered by chaos magic a.k.a dream magic which is the foundational energy of the mist. The human lore by the new writers in this thing is that their generic humans that one text window says that maybe they're from the mist.
[2023-01-05 11:41:54] <Malsavias> The deposit button you can deposit from anywhere

[2023-01-05 11:43:56] <Dreion> @CrewDarey 't know they were separate purchases. Couldn't buy them because poor so I experienced the story in a very disjointed way so I ended up not giving too many f's about it overall
[2023-01-05 11:43:58] <Cirrus> @chaosemperordragoneote I think the Hero panel used to be good, but now it has too many nested menus

[2023-01-05 12:24:34] <wowmuchtwitcher> another really awesome things about gw2 is you can respec for free at any time out of combat

[2023-01-05 12:25:42] <%turtleandfish> @turtleandfish i have, but im an oceanic boy playing on na servers, also someone always skips the story lines
[2023-01-05 12:25:45] <+kalamari__> @kirafg server dont matter for pve. only NA or EU
[2023-01-05 12:25:46] <%+Eltreum> gw2 allowing everything to cast while moving is still amazing to this day
[2023-01-05 12:25:48] <+Arpanis> love they used chars from GW1 like shiro
[2023-01-05 12:25:52] <%+TottWriter> @mez_taz I mean he hasn't found weapon swap yet...
[2023-01-05 12:25:52] <Rosevear> Just praying he will like the game to keep playing it more after what he sets out to do for now in it
[2023-01-05 12:25:53] <mez_taz> @Vernash_ it builds energy and then you switch stances to use it
[2023-01-05 12:25:56] <Carisiak> Unfortunate thing with GW2 is that the gameplay, the zones, the quests, the story, the encounters are so so so so much better in the expansions than in the base game, which makes it very hard for new players to adopt the game. That's why it's often recommended for people to just buy 1 expac use the booster to 80 and start with the expac story

[2023-01-05 12:26:27] <0rektquiem> since mike bought the expansions he should have a boost yeah?
[2023-01-05 12:26:32] <%Geri_0123> will he figure out the strength of offhand sword instead of axe
[2023-01-05 12:26:33] <%spejspag> Dwarf is BiS
[2023-01-05 12:26:35] <+Brandonhipster> he does
[2023-01-05 12:26:37] <wowmuchtwitcher> @Vernash_ things cost energy to use, you can gain energy pasively until half way but you can gain more from auto attacking
[2023-01-05 12:26:39] <%trebolf> Fury is nice
[2023-01-05 12:26:40] <%WoWBrandon> @carisiak sounds like wow for new players, at least the tutorial island was added
[2023-01-05 12:26:42] <%+Kinkypoptart> I think i dropped out of GW2 right before the first xpack.  Not even sure where I would start if I did come back lol
[2023-01-05 12:26:45] <+kalamari__> @mez_taz iirc weapon swa is at 15, no?
[2023-01-05 12:26:46] <mez_taz> @0rektquiem yes, but the point is for him to play the game like normal
[2023-01-05 12:26:48] <numinuminumnumnum> @Carisiak Not so different from FF14 though, even if ARR gotten better, it's just one of those "trust me, it gets better"
[2023-01-05 12:27:09] <%$Constipated_Lalafell> @Carisiak I mean mike enjoyed ARR so it shouldnt be an issue for him

[2023-01-05 12:54:43] <just_kith> @klaatuzu 100% with you on that, once you have ascended gear you are done with hearing so it's about skill progression, here only having ascended means very little if you don't press the buttons correctly
[2023-01-05 12:54:43] <mattakola> @ZushiYoko they started focusing on pve pretty much right after launch
[2023-01-05 12:54:44] <+danhideintree> The progression doesn't end at 80 Since you start having to work on Abilities Like unlocking different mounts and traversal methods like gliding But most of that comes with the expansions
[2023-01-05 12:54:44] <Fronali> @ZushiYoko i wish it was, anything outside pvp is mediocre at best

[2023-01-05 13:02:18] <Geronmy> @theomnisora Griphon is just a lot easier to get, Dragon is a lot harder but is also more practical

[2023-01-05 13:03:20] <xLeopanther> @TheOmniSora griphon can achieve high speeds if you have a h igh starting point. the higher up you start, the more it can convert that height into horizontal speed. skyscale can hover freely in the air and generally overcome most obstacles, but isn't super fast - and starts losing height after flying a short distance
[2023-01-05 13:03:21] <%Shelana95> @Pixiemix you got skyscale ?
[2023-01-05 13:03:22] <Pixiemix> Hi @JakeZGR acsHeart pixiem3Hey
[2023-01-05 13:03:24] <Rogalicus> Still gives you 2g I think

[2023-01-05 13:03:32] <Siggi_EMP> dailies give you the most important endgame currency: gold LUL
[2023-01-05 13:03:32] <Trafikk_> you will hit 80 far before clearing all the vanilla zones..... you will never clear everything before hitting cap

[2023-01-05 13:03:36] <+danhideintree> Dailies definitely worth it starting off 2 gold is nice

[2023-01-05 13:03:41] <TheOmniSora> tho ngl it's kinda weird they split the functionality on flying like that. i get the ground mounts usages, the flying ones got me a bit confused ^^;
[2023-01-05 13:03:45] <Densiz> dailies takes 2-7 mins for expert palyers. cuz all you have to do 3 of them
[2023-01-05 13:03:47] <%Geri_0123> @TheOmniSora you can just bunny + glider boost 3 and you can launch from anywhere
[2023-01-05 13:03:54] <%Shelana95> @Pixiemix Damn girl. I dont have the gryphon
[2023-01-05 13:03:54] <+tyrew0rm> Im surprised at the lack of mesmer portal trolling so far
[2023-01-05 13:03:57] <@%Methuzahla> Griffon was way easier to get than Skyscale but skyscale wasnt bad tbf
[2023-01-05 13:03:59] <+MrBrightside1> How much is a a lot of gold in GW2

[2023-01-05 13:09:52] <%MagicPants_99> maybe when you portal to the city you always spawn at the same spot
[2023-01-05 13:09:58] <%Geri_0123> @dragothicx nah it's more like goldshire
[2023-01-05 13:10:03] <+tyrew0rm> Lets be honest, most of us did that the first time we went to LA
[2023-01-05 13:10:05] <$Jennovaa> @Preachlfw Each portal gets you to specific place. Also you can just open map and click on the waypoint where you want to go as they are treated as "teleporters"
[2023-01-05 13:10:05] <Trafikk_> all Racial Cities have a Larhe Portal Gate to Lions Arch ... the Central City Hub

[2023-01-05 13:10:26] <wowmuchtwitcher> he came out that other portal because it was his first time there, normaly it spits you out the matching portal
[2023-01-05 13:10:27] <+zzeiden> this looks so bad compared to FFXIV
[2023-01-05 13:10:30] <brucemalt> hmmmm he's not going to find the hint mechanic, probably.

[2023-01-05 13:10:56] <Layton13> You can hover over the map legend of the specific piece and if you could see it on the map, it shines

[2023-01-05 13:14:20] <TheOmniSora> @zenoten wait you can still buy older expansions separately? also when you buy an expansion do you unlock the past ones? or do you have to buy them separately as well if you want to access their content?

[2023-01-05 13:20:22] <xLeopanther> @SlavicBro up to you. if you like story, you miss out on the story bits between expansions without living story. and while living story 1 (free anyways) and 2 don't contain much, from 3 onwards you also get pretty much a new map per story chapter (for most chapters)

[2023-01-05 13:23:10] <%+SpellboundTutor> @SlavicBro In my view, Seasons 3-5 (5 being Icebrood Saga) are very much worth it even if you're not interested in the story. Each episode has a new map, Seasons 3 and 4 have what are called "Meta Achievements" you can earn to unlock legendary accessories, then if you get meta achievements done for Seasons 2-5, you can get a Legendary Amulet, the easiest legendary in the game to get.
[2023-01-05 13:23:20] <brucemalt> @buurpie That hasn't really changed, Heart of Thornes is balanced around small groups, it is very difficult or impossible to do events and hero points solo.

[2023-01-05 13:27:01] <Kosen_> @newengines About what?
[2023-01-05 13:27:02] <+chaosemperordragoneote> the real challenge in gw2 are the dungeons. the dungeons are wild
[2023-01-05 13:27:05] <JaskoChaerin> @volkhvgaming never played wow but gw2 no gdcs so the combat kinda has to be very responsive,especially with evades and stuff
[2023-01-05 13:27:05] <%turtleandfish> @newengines https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Revenant
[2023-01-05 13:27:14] <%yashiru_> @JuanPunch with that said, gw2 has the majority of casual players who consider those raids still difficult KEKW
[2023-01-05 13:27:16] <skryah> @JuanPunch they're really not great, vast majority of bosses have 3 mechanics and are tuned so poorly that people can beat them with half the amount of players
[2023-01-05 13:27:19] <+bullard1> put up your map and hover your cursor over the hero challenge icons
[2023-01-05 13:27:19] <+y0uwantmi> the real challenge is getting the mounts KEKW
[2023-01-05 13:27:21] <newengines> @Kosen_ the class he is playing. it is clearly thief not rev
[2023-01-05 13:27:23] <+evildrtran> I hate how this Game handles quest objectives
[2023-01-05 13:27:24] <%+OldManEnglish> GW2 just has lots of varied content - and not all of it is well explained
[2023-01-05 13:27:30] <%+TottWriter> oh, thatr's the world boss up then
[2023-01-05 13:27:31] <%Shelana95> he is so close to one
[2023-01-05 13:27:33] <%Shelana95> :P
[2023-01-05 13:27:34] <%turtleandfish> @newengines is that a thief?
[2023-01-05 13:27:34] <%+OldManEnglish> Raids kinda got sidelined
[2023-01-05 13:27:35] <Geronmy> yeah gw2 has content for both sides of the spectrum
[2023-01-05 13:27:38] <PaeToWin> @Sognus challenging is subjective, just how in wow some people consider heroic a challenge, while other consider it piss easy
[2023-01-05 13:27:39] <%Shelana95> How tilting
[2023-01-05 13:27:42] <%+OldManEnglish> Strikes are where its at these days
[2023-01-05 13:27:47] <%turtleandfish> does level 18 thief know how to use a staff?
[2023-01-05 13:27:47] <%+SpellboundTutor> @tyrew0rm It definitely feels double-edged. Like... I love the action combat and the customizability of builds? But there is such a power disparity between builds that if you take one "wrong" trait, you could lose, like, 20% total DPS. It's rough.
[2023-01-05 13:27:51] <Densiz> wish wow had gw2's gameplay / combat
[2023-01-05 13:27:53] <Kosen_> @newengines It's Revenant, not Thief. Look - he even has Legendary Heroes on his bar lmao
[2023-01-05 13:27:55] <+redcobra_II> @yashiru_ if its easy show me your api and lets see what youve cleared
[2023-01-05 13:27:58] <%+Everwaltz> hovers to one hero challenge,proceeds to ignore it..typical mike KEKW
[2023-01-05 13:27:58] <kofer99> check the map in your zone they are the yellow marks
[2023-01-05 13:27:59] <NotYetRatedd> @newengines it's a revenant and I havent even played touched this game for 5 years, thief looks very different

[2023-01-05 13:28:04] <Sermenator> @turtleandfish it does not
[2023-01-05 13:28:05] <skryah> @turtleandfish no, you need to unlock daredevil (at level cap) to use a staff as a thief
[2023-01-05 13:28:07] <%+OldManEnglish> Strikes are basically Raid bosses - without the trash
[2023-01-05 13:28:07] <%yashiru_> @newengines i so hope you are just failed troll attempt
[2023-01-05 13:28:09] <%buurpie> @buurpie I just felt like I hit a wall and it turned me off the game. Haven't played for 2 years now ^^

[2023-01-05 13:30:14] <+chaosemperordragoneote> GW2 seems like the closest thing to exploring zones. Its still traversing but its close

[2023-01-05 13:30:15] <Mydw1nter> @Mydw1nter Not reading chat MUCH, doesn't mean he isn't reading it, just that he's not tracking everything. Also the mods could direct him to it. No need to be like that. :P

[2023-01-05 13:30:21] <%buurpie> @buurpie I do like the fact that you can just pick it up again. Gotta look into builds for my character to make it more viable. If only the maps were'nt too vertical for someone who doesn't have vertical movement..xD

[2023-01-05 13:41:34] <%+Khymori> @Khymori Exactly. I'm sure he''d love being part of it.
[2023-01-05 13:41:34] <wowmuchtwitcher> shame the map isnt very full
[2023-01-05 13:41:34] <%rymed> :)
[2023-01-05 13:41:35] <iDontFly> oh boy you will need moreppl than that
[2023-01-05 13:41:35] <gupug> boss was just up..its not happening now
[2023-01-05 13:41:37] <%turtleandfish> @IkkisFTW you should try, mesmer is very unique with its different class skill combos
[2023-01-05 13:41:42] <Cirrus> didn't the boss just die?
[2023-01-05 13:41:42] <vulkankragon> played gw2 at launch and got 3 characters to max level. haven't played in years.
[2023-01-05 13:41:53] <+Cookie_Fanatic> no wonder mike is a perfect legend, already doing world boss at level 18 GIGACHDA

[2023-01-05 13:41:59] <%$Constipated_Lalafell> mike makes me right
[2023-01-05 13:42:02] <skryah> @Khymori doubt it, Josh is very outspoken for not liking gw2
[2023-01-05 13:42:02] <%rymed> NODDERS might makes me right
[2023-01-05 13:42:11] <%spejspag> No world boss this time
[2023-01-05 13:42:16] <numinuminumnumnum> @IkkisFTW At first it didn't appeal to me, but magic classes grown on me as I've grown older, and especially purple/pink magic with illusions, mind messing and crazy shenanigans
[2023-01-05 13:42:16] <%Hoszemarino> NODDERS might makes me right

[2023-01-05 13:42:27] <ShyGuyZero> rev has low cds, but you need to manage the energy, thats why its balanced
[2023-01-05 13:42:28] <%Mallas2> @SpellboundTutor i thnk the lack of people on this shard might not be good. but i am going off like 10 years ago  so
[2023-01-05 13:42:30] <mett7> level is nothing in this game, you got scaling on each map anyway so now they just give lv80 boost to expantions
[2023-01-05 13:42:35] <%$Constipated_Lalafell> @Khymori Josh hates gw2, he brings it up every chance he gets
[2023-01-05 13:42:37] <%+Khymori> @Khymori I thought he did like it, just for different reasons than GW1?
[2023-01-05 13:42:49] <%+SpellboundTutor> @Khymori I mean, I don't think he hates it. It's just not his favorite. Which is fine. But he does really like GW1, last I checked

[2023-01-05 13:43:11] <skryah> @Khymori nah he really hates GW2, he says the combat is trash because you never need to explore it, but he does like GW1 a lot

[2023-01-05 13:43:15] <PaeToWin> @Khymori WDYM hate it, he loves the game lol, he has thousands of hours palyed

[2023-01-05 13:43:17] <greg_with_beard> have to wait for the npc to arrive
[2023-01-05 13:43:23] <Siggi_EMP> @Tetra85 if they only spawn as part of n event and that event ends
[2023-01-05 13:43:23] <%Shelana95> oh, maybe not. wierd

[2023-01-05 13:44:23] <vulkankragon> biggest drawback of gw2 is gear progression stops at lvl 80, after that just fashion
[2023-01-05 13:44:25] <xandredh> top left one - it's the one with the helmet @Preachlfw
[2023-01-05 13:44:33] <IkkisFTW> you unlock more daily achievements later I think
[2023-01-05 13:44:33] <%Shelana95> It was 30 min ago. I retract my statement

[2023-01-05 13:44:44] <skryah> @Khymori even before that, I thought the 2nd expansion was terrible and the constant abandonment of game modes is a deal breaker
[2023-01-05 13:44:45] <onetappenreblath> preach. highly recommend to play a different class if you want to have fun in raids, etc
[2023-01-05 13:44:50] <@%Methuzahla> aye
[2023-01-05 13:44:52] <IkkisFTW> should be 3 4 wvw, 4 pve, 4 scenario pvp
[2023-01-05 13:44:57] <EclipserEU> strike missions are like FF14 Trials
[2023-01-05 13:44:57] <alwiro> @vulkankragon good, no gear grinding treadmill
[2023-01-05 13:45:00] <%+Atzaru> boy I wish it was like Mythic+

[2023-01-05 13:45:05] <%Shelana95> Fractials are fun
[2023-01-05 13:45:12] <skryah> @chaosemperordragoneote ok but saying a game is good and liking it are two very different thing. I dislike GW2 but still think it's amazing and more people should try it
[2023-01-05 13:45:15] <%+Awerlu> he already forgot about the dye haha
[2023-01-05 13:45:20] <ShyGuyZero> @vulkankragon thats why fashion is the true endgame, and achievment hunting, for that reason btw i like gw2, i got legendary on every slot after a year of doing stuff. and now my character is geared for every occasion

[2023-01-05 13:45:27] <%+bigjavachungus> how similar is gw2 to wow or ff?
[2023-01-05 13:45:31] <%+Curon> I guess it is just recent development of 2022 that the dev get a little bit more agile with the class  balancing
[2023-01-05 13:45:34] <%+mkluvin1515> @methuzahla any discount codes etc provided by our GW2 dev friends?
[2023-01-05 13:45:35] <Lctl10> @chaosemperordragoneote agree. I dislike it - but its a good game for people to try it
[2023-01-05 13:45:37] <forkace> not very similar tbh
[2023-01-05 13:45:39] <Siggi_EMP> you unlock more possible daily quests to chose from as you level your first character on an account
[2023-01-05 13:45:40] <skryah> @bigjavachungus not similar at all, it's like a polar opposite
[2023-01-05 13:45:43] <wowmuchtwitcher> @vulkankragon but you continue progression through skill, most of your power comes from mechanical mastery
[2023-01-05 13:45:43] <%+Atzaru> @bigjavachungus not very, if at all
[2023-01-05 13:45:43] <onetappenreblath> @bigjavachungus way different
[2023-01-05 13:45:43] <%+Javandus> Yes Chef!
[2023-01-05 13:45:43] <@%Methuzahla> well thats why he wanted to try different MMOs out. We were doing a video on the ways different MMOs worked so he knows very basic things. Like he knows about fractals etc
[2023-01-05 13:45:44] <EclipserEU> @bigjavachungus its very different mmo
[2023-01-05 13:45:47] <%Mallas2> @alwiro there is a tad if you want legendary or celestial gear which is a tad better for the min max but overall not mandatory
[2023-01-05 13:45:48] <+chaosemperordragoneote> @skryah yeah but you sounded like he just found it awful and bad lol
[2023-01-05 13:45:52] <revanton93> Isnt there close a world boss fight here?
[2023-01-05 13:45:54] <PaeToWin> @Khymori it's normal to become disappointed with the game after you play for a long time, but the first hundred hours are a very nice experience
[2023-01-05 13:45:58] <@%Methuzahla> @mkluvin1515 No discount codes that Im aware of! Sorry!
[2023-01-05 13:46:03] <+Amandagray825> @vulkankragon sure, gear is horizontal, but have you done the legendary grind? It takes forever to fully kit out characters
[2023-01-05 13:46:04] <skryah> @chaosemperordragoneote yeah I guess I could've been clearer, mb

[2023-01-05 13:46:23] <numinuminumnumnum> @chaosemperordragoneote Yup, GW2 is different, I've kinda burnt out on GW2 and realize I kinda prefer WoW/FF14 style MMO's more, but boy if GW2 wasn't a fun ride and honestly worth a shot, especially if you're not an MMO fan normally
[2023-01-05 13:46:24] <vulkankragon> @Amandagray825 yes, many years ago

[2023-01-05 13:46:32] <skryah> @Khymori I agree, though I think the leveling hasn't aged too well anymore, HoT is still my #1 expansion to any mmo ever
[2023-01-05 13:46:40] <+gnaronius> How old is this game looks good?
[2023-01-05 13:46:48] <+chaosemperordragoneote> @numinuminumnumnum Yeah gw2 provides a refreshing and unique mmorpg experience
[2023-01-05 13:46:49] <Siggi_EMP> Chug! Chug! Chug!
[2023-01-05 13:46:49] <%turtleandfish> @chaosemperordragoneote i think gw2 has done many good innovative stuff in the mmo genre like mounts and scaled world events, but i hate that they dont have a simple lfd system

[2023-01-05 13:47:13] <annie_sullivan1962> @skryah because the gameplay in guild wars original requires you to know how your skills work the best together to do their best. While in this one you can slam your head into the keyboard and the passives will win even the hardest thing for you.
[2023-01-05 13:47:15] <IkkisFTW> I think world bosses, raids and pvp is the most fun out of gw2 for me
[2023-01-05 13:47:15] <skryah> you cannot :)
[2023-01-05 13:47:18] <+chaosemperordragoneote> preach makes me wanna play again LUL

[2023-01-05 13:47:23] <skryah> absolutely no UI customization in this game
[2023-01-05 13:47:23] <thewickeddm> did he just miss the hero point?
[2023-01-05 13:47:26] <%Dumannios> that beer is gonna go bad in his inverntory xD
[2023-01-05 13:47:29] <%Mallas2> @alwiro yea this is just a grind for fashion really. but in this game its fun for sure. and some of the boss fights are pretty large scale and kinda cool
[2023-01-05 13:47:32] <iDontFly> BTW there's a item in your inv, you consume it to gain this Hero Point
[2023-01-05 13:47:32] <%+Curon> ui adjustments in gw2? um ....
[2023-01-05 13:47:33] <%Mallas2> world boss tha tis
[2023-01-05 13:47:35] <Saitouakira> @thewickeddm he did
[2023-01-05 13:47:39] <skryah> @annie_sullivan1962 yep, most classes win the entire game by just spamming 1
[2023-01-05 13:47:51] <+chaosemperordragoneote> the instant pvp mode in this game is also fantastic
[2023-01-05 13:47:51] <numinuminumnumnum> @Khymori HoT zones are so amazingly designed, a nightmare to go through, but those zones to this day feel like a genuine dangerous adventure, and they're so freaking massive

[2023-01-05 13:48:54] <%Mallas2> @alwiro yea thats a decent one. there is one from one of the expansions where the dragon is prob 10 times the size of the that dragon
[2023-01-05 13:48:57] <skryah> @Khymori they need to do a lot more to win people over again, so far it's not been significant

[2023-01-05 13:53:25] <+chaosemperordragoneote> Its not real exploration. but its still awesome

[2023-01-05 13:53:38] <+redcobra_II> i like the bunny quest where you have to steal food from the bunnies before they wack you
[2023-01-05 13:53:39] <Layton13> Exploration is a viable leveling path
[2023-01-05 13:53:41] <Wolrus> @turtleandfish it is a  bit sad
[2023-01-05 13:53:47] <+Newlevels> yeah leveling can be fun in Gw2 compared to most mmos even if old tyria is a bit outdated.
[2023-01-05 13:53:51] <Saitouakira> i sooo badly want to go over there with preach and just show my dagon mount to him xD
[2023-01-05 13:53:54] <%$Brinstar_Prime> GW2 has my favorite leveling experience of any MMO honestly
[2023-01-05 13:53:54] <%+SpellboundTutor> Exploration is one thing GW2 excels at
[2023-01-05 13:53:58] <numinuminumnumnum> Exploration is literally what GW2 is best for, anyone who loves just running around and adventuring will like it, also got secret stuff around most zones
[2023-01-05 13:53:59] <%turtleandfish> @turtleandfish fair but sometimes you do run across event bosses in low level areas, like bloodstained beasts or scarlet events
[2023-01-05 13:53:59] <+Amandagray825> @redcobra_ii oh man, I hated that one ü§£
[2023-01-05 13:54:02] <Skyle4f> it is

[2023-01-05 13:54:09] <ookookdook> honestly gw2 levelling is fantastic, but then the endgame is where it lacks happythoNotLikeThis

[2023-01-05 13:54:40] <Spaydex> @Shaklug thats so not true, not even close
[2023-01-05 13:54:40] <Saitouakira> @Shaklug tbh story at heart of thorns and living world is great also
[2023-01-05 13:54:44] <%+SpellboundTutor> @SpellboundTutor Oh for sure. While it's a proper zone and not a city, New Kaineng feels absolutely enormous.
[2023-01-05 13:54:46] <+redcobra_II> @ookookdook fractal, strike and raid cms are pretty good though and they stay relevant
[2023-01-05 13:54:59] <%urbish_> so is Mike gonna alternate games? Or finish GW2 fractals and raids first
[2023-01-05 13:55:02] <%Vinestra28> Pog HE FOUND IT

[2023-01-05 13:55:11] <%NomadHook> @ookookdook I love the game and will always recommend it, but my favorite content is fractals and the last one came out in 2020
[2023-01-05 13:55:12] <adramael> yes
[2023-01-05 13:55:14] <%+Curon> I logged into gw2 earlier ....my main char's inventory was totally clogged, logged out ...
[2023-01-05 13:55:14] <lesspewpewmoreqq> Yes
[2023-01-05 13:55:15] <+Draethas22> yup
[2023-01-05 13:55:17] <Skyle4f> yep
[2023-01-05 13:55:17] <%$Brinstar_Prime> Meaning you can ALWAYS level with your friends. Brilliant
[2023-01-05 13:55:17] <Trafikk_> trouble is not learning to use dodge early ingame shows when a huge amount of people get to hit and DIE all the time because they have never learnt how to use dodge and the importance of it and i-frames
[2023-01-05 13:55:28] <skryah> @ookookdook the absolute opposite, fractals and raids are not relevant anymore and they're barely updated (or outright abandoned) and the quality is D -tier at best
[2023-01-05 13:55:28] <+Draethas22> your power level is just 12
[2023-01-05 13:55:28] <+cos_mix> he doesn't read chat, why are people answering? XDDD

[2023-01-05 13:55:35] <+Poowez> Your level is scaled but the skills etc are still the same
[2023-01-05 13:55:40] <%Zirconix> level scaling now? Nice, I remember dropping this game when it first came out because i ran out of quests to do around my level and didn't know how to progress
[2023-01-05 13:55:41] <MightyMatey> the downscaling is just a stat squish
[2023-01-05 13:55:43] <Mesis> @ookookdook stop spreading misinformation thanks ?-)
[2023-01-05 13:55:44] <annie_sullivan1962> Like move out of the fire with your simple walk useless. I think they added it for the people that aren't good. You will be surprised how simply walking away from the aoe just worked for me even the hardest parts. It like a never moved from every other mmo.
[2023-01-05 13:55:46] <+BogzyMan> just scales ur stats, ure still stronger than that actual lvl
[2023-01-05 13:55:48] <itsjoodu> I really like that red lightning thing in the ground, looks dope
[2023-01-05 13:55:53] <skryah> @Brinstar_Prime in theory yes, in practice you will oneshot everytihng and auto pilot, while they have a miserable experience
[2023-01-05 13:55:53] <%Quickfirex4> Yall really need to realise he isnt reading chat
[2023-01-05 13:55:54] <@%Methuzahla> GW2 and ESO are my oldest MMOs.  Im so so glad hes playing this. Couldnt convince him on ESO though lol

[2023-01-05 13:55:56] <%XRay2x> @cos_mix habit probably, cause he's usually on point with chat engagement lol
[2023-01-05 13:55:59] <PaeToWin> @Zirconix game had level scaling since day 1
[2023-01-05 13:56:02] <numinuminumnumnum> @SpellboundTutor First time I saw Divinity's Reach my jaw dropped, it doesn't feel as scaled down as say Stormwind or Ul'dah does
[2023-01-05 13:56:04] <+Grimmov> @ookookdook He's right though, factals and raids are marginal content in GW2 and not the focus of the game
[2023-01-05 13:56:10] <+redcobra_II> @ookookdook fractals are still pretty much the best raw gold per hour in the game theyre still relevant
[2023-01-05 13:56:16] <%Mallas2> @alwiro but Tequalt and shatterer are good WB fights. better than any WoW WB
[2023-01-05 13:56:16] <%urbish_> no ESO FeelsBadMan
[2023-01-05 13:56:17] <%+SpellboundTutor> @ookookdook I mean, I disagree on the quality, but they are right that they're not as updated. Strike Missions seem to be the new hotness these days.

[2023-01-05 14:00:11] <baggytrousers> Every video game is just a slight variation on Dark Souls FeelsGoodMan
[2023-01-05 14:00:12] <numinuminumnumnum> @skryah Yeah it's what turned me away from GW2, lack of proper challenges, structured ones, fractals is fun, after sometime, but mostly player it cause friends did, there was nothing I felt I wanted to experience, doesn't help I feel +5 people GW2's combat falls apart
[2023-01-05 14:00:16] <%+Awerlu> GW2 Fashion endgamers, whats GW2's closest dye to honey yellow?
[2023-01-05 14:00:23] <%+SpellboundTutor> @skryah That's fine. Have you done the new challenge mode strikes? You want amazing fights and challenge, they're there. It doesn't negate your point that they neglect older content modes, but the challenge exists still.

[2023-01-05 14:01:41] <skryah> @numinuminumnumnum the combat was made for 5 people with the combo system, it does still sorta work for raids but it's quite janky and not very well balanced, I can definitely see what makes you say that
[2023-01-05 14:01:42] <gdguitarist> I hope he figures out salvage kits soon

[2023-01-05 14:01:51] <%+SpellboundTutor> @skryah Again, okay. Should I talk about how dogshit bad the new WoW expansion handled its raid without ever setting foot in it, though? Because I don't think that'd be very fair of me to do. :\
[2023-01-05 14:01:52] <betweenlions> @Spaydex so just buy the expac? that doesnt tell me much especially when i dont really understand what you mean cor game
[2023-01-05 14:01:53] <baggytrousers> The world switching stuff is incredibly frustrating, it's true
[2023-01-05 14:01:54] <+Shrugal> You need an iron will to stay on track in this game
[2023-01-05 14:01:57] <SpiritoftheFourWinds> its literally sharding yeah
[2023-01-05 14:02:00] <Sgt_Whiskeyjack> its to get people to leave empty instances
[2023-01-05 14:02:01] <grumpy_hades> and pls combine bags
[2023-01-05 14:02:01] <%OmegaSyntaX> It's kind of like Eureka
[2023-01-05 14:02:02] <IkkisFTW> ye, sharding, it is a bit annoying sometimes
[2023-01-05 14:02:06] <%Geri_0123> unless you are fishing and you lose stacks
[2023-01-05 14:02:06] <grumpy_hades> my eyes
[2023-01-05 14:02:07] <+donny_dinosaur> its been like that since GW1
[2023-01-05 14:02:19] <IkkisFTW> sometimes shard just closes 5 min after you move to new one
[2023-01-05 14:02:22] <Fronali> main issue with GW2 is that the combat is tailored for fast pace and mainly pvp, but the devs are pretty incompetent so spvp has been completely abandoned for years, WvW has issues because its a dx9 game and pve has more abandoned systems and content than WoW
[2023-01-05 14:02:24] <+Tickwick> wow does it secretive manner where you get sharded in front of a boss lol
[2023-01-05 14:02:25] <Siggi_EMP> it usually pops up after meta events when big amounts of players get into a map and move on shortly after
[2023-01-05 14:02:25] <@%Methuzahla> or if you're mid meta-event and dont wanna lose prog or something
[2023-01-05 14:02:26] <Trafikk_> there is jusr1 mega server with shards that increase and decrease depending on the population at any time

[2023-01-05 14:03:41] <numinuminumnumnum> @numinuminumnumnum Problem I had with raid content is that it uses trinity system whilst GW2 isn't built for it, it's a mess and it turns into running around in a clump with several of your abilities being useless cause of it being a boss
[2023-01-05 14:03:45] <Fronali> ohright it is "dx11" now... still makes it dogwater

[2023-01-05 14:06:55] <skryah> @skryah never said they're objectively bad content. just that they're few and far between and not very well tuned at all.
[2023-01-05 14:06:58] <+lalandir> GW2 is not solely focused on endgame instanced PvE and that's fine, lots of games focus on it and do it better.
[2023-01-05 14:06:58] <lordGualz> sane va again
[2023-01-05 14:06:58] <clowntamer> a shame this game is so dead
[2023-01-05 14:06:59] <+ye1l> The one thing that completely kills guildwars for me and is a dealbreaker no matter how much I try to overlook it is the absolutely disgusting camera smoothing I can't handle it at all
[2023-01-05 14:07:01] <clowntamer> gw3 will be better
[2023-01-05 14:07:03] <Radium_Lavans> gw2 is not the best... it got nice things.. but to say it's the best.... na
[2023-01-05 14:07:03] <foodrepublic> did they even update the game content since eod release? new raid? new living world?
[2023-01-05 14:07:16] <+BogzyMan> @clowntamer why? cuz u dont lay it? its not dead at all
[2023-01-05 14:07:20] <%+Jarclawle> Sounds like 300 Xerxes

[2023-01-05 14:07:32] <+redcobra_II> @tek__ dont worry I see where youre coming from, HTCM is of course very challenging and interested a few Wow Hardcore raiders, but gw2 simply does not pump out enough of it to keep the interest of people who main raids
[2023-01-05 14:07:40] <%+Supersenkel> Not gonna lie, these cutscenes are a bit immersion breaking LUL
[2023-01-05 14:07:42] <skryah> @lalandir that's the problem that most people have right? it's neither focused on pvp instances, or open world pvp, or instanced pve, just some open world and story content (which it is quite good at)
[2023-01-05 14:07:42] <PaeToWin> @Radium_Lavans no game can be the best. at most it can be the best for someone

[2023-01-05 14:07:58] <xLeopanther> @foodrepublic the main thing they did is re-releasing living world season 1 fully (which wasn't replayable previously). next big patch should bring something new, though no clue what
[2023-01-05 14:08:02] <%$xephalia> this part of the story is by FAR the weakest. The base game I mean

[2023-01-05 14:08:47] <+lalandir> @lalandir That's true, it's got a good casual PvE for those who enjoy it, and is a casual exploration MMO (think Genshin Impact more than WoW). That said I mostly play WvW and although it's been neglected it is still the best implementation of RvR in current day MMOs.
[2023-01-05 14:08:54] <Calphurnious> @Grimmov Ah shit yeah, was annoying as fuck having to buy bag slots for every character
[2023-01-05 14:08:55] <%turtleandfish> @lalandir can you imagine the uproar if wow's last new dungeon was 2 years old, the fractal thing is a fair point

[2023-01-05 14:11:27] <skryah> @danhideintree it's also because they purposefully make the game worse to sell you the solution (bank slots, bag slots, shared slots, skins that should be earnable in activities etc)
[2023-01-05 14:11:34] <wowmuchtwitcher> @skryah they have been doing a better job in the last year compared to the past though no?

[2023-01-05 14:12:06] <%+SpellboundTutor> @skryah I'm just confused. Like... first Strikes were too sparsely released, then HT CM was cleared too fast, then they'll abandon it in three months. Which is it tho?
[2023-01-05 14:12:12] <%Baalroq> @wowmuchtwitcher ok well I have all the expacs just haven‚Äôt gotten around to starting it

[2023-01-05 14:12:49] <%+SpellboundTutor> @skryah Because the story keeps changing whenever I push back.
[2023-01-05 14:12:58] <baggytrousers> I personally wish GW2 was subscription-based and that mounts were earnable in-game. But, it's still a great game
[2023-01-05 14:12:59] <skryah> @ShyGuyZero it isn't f2p to begin with is it
[2023-01-05 14:12:59] <revanton93> @id_invaded__ yep by falling down but a player instant ressed him.
[2023-01-05 14:13:00] <%+Awerlu> @ShyGuyZero I would prefer a monthly fee personally. But I know many prefer f2p mmos
[2023-01-05 14:13:08] <+IrrelevantFerret> @frog_89_ Real price is the complete collection on steam, not much hidden there
[2023-01-05 14:13:13] <PaeToWin> @frog_89_ this is probably the 'free-est' MMO on the market
[2023-01-05 14:13:16] <+chaosemperordragoneote> In terms of quality, I dont think any mmorpg beats gw2 I feel like
[2023-01-05 14:13:17] <+KeyrisNyan> it's B2P, not F2P
[2023-01-05 14:13:19] <Pyrae_K> @ShyGuyZero tbh, gw2 with a sub could be a vastly superior game. It's sad how most of dev time goes to gem shop it seems
[2023-01-05 14:13:21] <maosama11> @frog_89_ i mean i quit 7 years, relogged in and im still in BiS i dunno what else you need from a game
[2023-01-05 14:13:22] <%KelticNight> GW2 didn't start f2p, it's cost ¬£50 on release
[2023-01-05 14:13:31] <+danhideintree> Do monthly paid mmos with no cash shop even exist nowadays?
[2023-01-05 14:13:33] <wowmuchtwitcher> @Baalroq it is worth doing the story on at least one character, theres a lot to learn
[2023-01-05 14:13:40] <id_invaded__> @revanton93 LUL Shame seems like enemies dont do much dmg
[2023-01-05 14:13:43] <+RenzikOz> This game u can buy the cash shop items with gold conversion why you‚Äôd complaining about its business model lol
[2023-01-05 14:13:47] <+Grimmov> @ShyGuyZero I would prefer GW2 with a sub and all those skins earnable ingame
[2023-01-05 14:13:53] <TheBrinern> they would still sell the same shit on the gem shop with a sub fee LUL
[2023-01-05 14:13:55] <%turtleandfish> @baggytrousers arent mounts earnable in-game? i am only on the base game but i have not seen any option that allows me to get additional mounts
[2023-01-05 14:13:58] <Citronxe> Not having to pay sub helps in keeping my sanity of missing a day on my sub time
[2023-01-05 14:14:02] <ShyGuyZero> @Pyrae_K probably would be but, lets be honest they make way more bank this way. and other mmos have free + in game shop

[2023-01-05 14:14:17] <+Tigrillotrot> @frog_89_ it could be worse, at least it's not p2w. Simply treat it as an extensive trial with f2p and always remember that money needs to always come in or no new content can be released. PVP games can work f2p, PVE games usually don't.

[2023-01-05 14:14:27] <skryah> @RenzikOz because the decisions they make to decide on what to sell directly make the game worse (bag slots, bank slots, shared slots, char slots, flooding your inventory with shit, etc etc etc)

[2023-01-05 14:14:40] <%urbish_> skipped Sadge
[2023-01-05 14:14:41] <Pyrae_K> @ShyGuyZero I mean, yeah, no point in speculating
[2023-01-05 14:14:54] <Citronxe> @id_invaded__ you don't ever not use internet at home, or? PauseChamp
[2023-01-05 14:14:57] <id_invaded__> @oldmanenglish I see
[2023-01-05 14:14:59] <+Cookie_Fanatic> i cant believe mike goes back to being a skipper after a few weeks of WoW, we need to purify his soul again so he can see the light
[2023-01-05 14:15:01] <+RenzikOz> @skryah but u can earn all that with using rl money?
[2023-01-05 14:15:08] <karamabdullah94> Just tuned in, how has it been so far?
[2023-01-05 14:15:08] <+RenzikOz> Without
[2023-01-05 14:15:15] <+chaosemperordragoneote> how long is he planning not to read chat?
[2023-01-05 14:15:18] <+Grimmov> I got really bored of dealing with the way GW2 floods your inventory with bullshit. Would spend an hour or 2 per day sorting it out.
[2023-01-05 14:15:20] <skryah> @RenzikOz which is completely irrelevant
[2023-01-05 14:15:21] <%KelticNight> people gonna watch this thinking you get a mount to use but you don't cos devs threw him a key with all the expansions. this isn't the "new player" epxerience
[2023-01-05 14:15:21] <id_invaded__> @citronxe I do not feel need to use it because i pay for it.
[2023-01-05 14:15:27] <+Hyphixsys> smol
[2023-01-05 14:15:30] <ismalakoi> @RenzikOz Yeah LOL, you can convert Gold into Cash with a fair ratio
[2023-01-05 14:15:34] <%+InquisitorLockhart> Might makes you right NOTED
[2023-01-05 14:15:39] <%+OldManEnglish> @chaosemperordragoneote 1st stream is his normal approach
[2023-01-05 14:15:39] <baggytrousers> @baggytrousers That's very fair. I like how in FFXIV most cosmetics are linked to specific tasks though - in GW2 every cosmetic is basically 'farm gold through fractals/strikes and convert to gems' I feel
[2023-01-05 14:15:42] <+Jedaero> This quest is much quicker if you‚Äôre here during the last stage of the meta quest for the zone
[2023-01-05 14:15:46] <hubbathegrate> @frog_89_ idk about PvE games not working as F2P, Genshin is PvE only afaik?
[2023-01-05 14:15:47] <%+OldManEnglish> then he does research between streams, and reads chat
[2023-01-05 14:15:48] <%Quickfirex4> mount is part of base game now. Try to troll harder
[2023-01-05 14:15:50] <DragonofEternity> can we have a "might makes me right" counter?
[2023-01-05 14:15:52] <TobiSetGo> @RenzikOz i only paid $120 in this game in 8 years :) so yes. every other upgrades are all earned in game, including extra dlc stories
[2023-01-05 14:16:10] <%buurpie> I never got a mount D:
[2023-01-05 14:16:11] <fgprijgiodfflgrf> @Quickfirex4 only a trial
[2023-01-05 14:16:14] <Radium_Lavans> earned in game if you want to farm like crazzzzy
[2023-01-05 14:16:15] <+krip123> did he not realize he has a free slot for ability?
[2023-01-05 14:16:15] <clarence_w> @RenzikOz thats the only bad thing about their monetization imo. locking story chapters behind it
[2023-01-05 14:16:15] <fgprijgiodfflgrf> for like 10 hours
[2023-01-05 14:16:15] <wowmuchtwitcher> @KelticNight you get mount trial at level 10 even if you dont have expac
[2023-01-05 14:16:16] <%KelticNight> @quickfirex4 it's not. you get a 10 hour "trial" of the mount, you have to buy a certain expansion to unlock it. you troll harder.
[2023-01-05 14:16:17] <+danhideintree> @Quickfirex4 You still need to own POF otherwise its a 10 hour trial per character
[2023-01-05 14:16:20] <PaeToWin> @baggytrousers that's a hyperbole, not EVERY skin is like that
[2023-01-05 14:16:30] <itsjoodu> you can *technically* earn the premium currency in game
[2023-01-05 14:16:33] <skryah> @RenzikOz if you're willing to spend hours grinding gold in the game as opposed to just buying it for money, that's up to you. but that doesn't excuse any shitty practices
[2023-01-05 14:16:33] VIEWERS: 3¬†763
[2023-01-05 14:16:36] <%+meriwidget> i guess it's a new feature to just give newbies a raptor mount at level 10? i think
[2023-01-05 14:16:36] <baggytrousers> @baggytrousers Well, every mount skin anyway
[2023-01-05 14:16:39] <drohkah> @Quickfirex4 Plenty of fish?
[2023-01-05 14:16:41] <%turtleandfish> @RenzikOz you can also be like me and wait for free shit like the recent Living world season 1 to play it
[2023-01-05 14:16:45] <fgprijgiodfflgrf> you can easily earn the premium currency in game
[2023-01-05 14:16:46] <PaeToWin> @baggytrousers there's a reasonable amount of ingame earnable cool skins

[2023-01-05 14:17:00] <Citronxe> @id_invaded__ I see. Internet connection is a necessity on my current lifestyle (and work), so it's needed in every sense of the word

[2023-01-05 14:17:08] <Radium_Lavans> only 10 hours of the mount? XD aha so walking when he tries tomorrow
[2023-01-05 14:17:19] <hschuckerbee> @baggytrousers Additional mounts are unlocked via Path of Fire (where the raptor is originally unlocked instead of just owning any expansion and moving out of F2P today) but the skins are all CS
[2023-01-05 14:17:20] <clarence_w> @SleepyPlant2 yea gw2 feels dated now. we're overdue for gw3
[2023-01-05 14:17:21] <fgprijgiodfflgrf> he has the expansion
[2023-01-05 14:17:25] <fgprijgiodfflgrf> so its not a trial
[2023-01-05 14:17:30] <fgprijgiodfflgrf> the trial is for f2p players
[2023-01-05 14:17:33] <%Mallas2> @PaeToWin mostly all the best are earned in game tho some are nearly impossible because lack of players in the area or whatever (at least when i played whe ni missed a living story)
[2023-01-05 14:17:37] <+interztellar> Might makes me right NODDERS
[2023-01-05 14:17:37] <%tazman524> @SleepyPlant2 i mean classic looks rough this might improve with expansions
[2023-01-05 14:17:37] <Wolrus> @Radium_Lavans he has expacs so mount won't time out
[2023-01-05 14:17:38] <Cirrus> @SleepyPlant2 This is a vanilla zone though, WoW would feel rough too in the old zones
[2023-01-05 14:17:38] <+RenzikOz> @skryah how about u come up with a game that pleases everyone than lol. Your like a journalist no talent all critics
[2023-01-05 14:17:49] <baggytrousers> @baggytrousers I know, I have all the mounts :P skins is what I meant
[2023-01-05 14:17:50] <Siggi_EMP> @Radium_Lavans that's only for f2p accounts, he has access to expansions so he has a raptor without time limitations
[2023-01-05 14:17:51] <+Grimmov> GW3 is cancelled, that's why they resumed developing GW2 after ignoring it for a year or two.
[2023-01-05 14:17:56] <skryah> @RenzikOz ??? what the fuck are you on about?
[2023-01-05 14:17:57] <Densiz> @Preachlfw tip : you can right click to your salvage kit

[2023-01-05 14:18:54] <+Tigrillotrot> @SleepyPlant2 they must have invested a lot of money and time to constantly redo it. Have a look at something like swtor that released many years later and compare how bad that one has aged.

[2023-01-05 14:22:50] <karamabdullah94> Does he also have the expacs?

[2023-01-05 14:23:05] <%Tartuccio> yeah @karamabdullah94
[2023-01-05 14:23:07] <skryah> yep, wow is the last mmo with non-instanced continents
[2023-01-05 14:23:08] <%turtleandfish> @itsjoodu he kinda forgot that he had an msq cos hes an explorer now
[2023-01-05 14:23:14] <Wolrus> @karamabdullah94 at least 2 I think cause has boosts
[2023-01-05 14:23:20] <hubbathegrate> @TobiSetGo It more seems like he once loved the game, and is dissapointed that the things he liked aren't around or the focus of development anymore.
[2023-01-05 14:23:28] <NatlerSK> @Preachlfw type IP and find out
[2023-01-05 14:23:29] <revanton93> Chat buble?
[2023-01-05 14:23:31] <%+SpellboundTutor> @skryah Just feels strange to me. Because I agree with some of your criticisms, but some just seem to be overgeneralized. Like, again, the Strike Mission situation as it feels like you're taking a lot of your issues with raids and fractals and putting it on Strikes.
[2023-01-05 14:23:31] <%+MisterFinch> Exploration is honestly what makes Guild Wars 2 amazing.
[2023-01-05 14:23:32] <+chaosemperordragoneote> Well complete zone explorations are needed for legendaries

[2023-01-05 14:23:49] <itsjoodu> @itsjoodu I love seeing him immersed tho, brings back baby gw2 player memories
[2023-01-05 14:23:50] <revanton93> if i remember good guildwars 2 has chat bubles right?
[2023-01-05 14:23:55] <Greenpearlzz> ooh revenant, excellent choice
[2023-01-05 14:23:55] <%Eeisal> GW2 hands down best map design.
[2023-01-05 14:23:58] <%captainuselessv2> spoil away? harry potter dies
[2023-01-05 14:24:02] <TobiSetGo> @hubbathegrate sure but we dont need to hear about it. especially not in a streamer's chat when they are excited about a new game :)
[2023-01-05 14:24:04] <einfachnorb> @revanton93 yes
[2023-01-05 14:24:08] <+KeyrisNyan> @skryah lotro too
[2023-01-05 14:24:10] <pogs4pepe> what class is he playing?
[2023-01-05 14:24:10] <%Eeisal> @revanton93 yes
[2023-01-05 14:24:13] <%pyromoto> the last few zones of the base game story killed the desire to explore for me. it was insufferable
[2023-01-05 14:24:14] <annie_sullivan1962> So, one of the zone quests in Everquest 1 that you jump your way up a cave to reach an ogre-type monster, and he had a 100% chance to drop an amulet that you give to an NPC.

[2023-01-05 14:24:38] <PaeToWin> @skryah He's criticizing strikes because strikes are designed as a more casual, easier type of raids. He enjoys aspirational/harder content. And the design goes directly against his desire
[2023-01-05 14:24:38] <frog_89_> so what's the downfall of this game? obviously it's not the best mmo out there so

[2023-01-05 14:30:06] <somename91> @kelticnight there is little room for that because we'll. no foliage and just snow and stone instead. so yeah.

[2023-01-05 14:30:24] <Starqu4ke> Is map completion account wide? I would hate to do that for every class
[2023-01-05 14:30:27] <%NomadHook> And you can also buy Gen1 leges off the trading post if you don't want to do it
[2023-01-05 14:30:29] <%Geri_0123> @pocketdimension I mean needed for mastery
[2023-01-05 14:30:36] <%KelticNight> does he have Windows Vista? monkaHmm

[2023-01-05 14:30:51] <wowmuchtwitcher> @Starqu4ke its per toon because the rewards are pretty meaningfull

[2023-01-05 14:31:03] <%FrenchFraies> PepeLaugh
[2023-01-05 14:31:03] <%NomadHook> @Starqu4ke It is not account wide, but map completion isn't necessary
[2023-01-05 14:31:04] <+kahlakah> you can hover over the compltion totals in the top left to highlight them on the map
[2023-01-05 14:31:05] <TheOmniSora> imagine skipping a panoramic scene in xiv NOPERS
[2023-01-05 14:31:06] <Siggi_EMP> @Starqu4ke you get an accountwide title the first time you 100%, everything else is character specific
[2023-01-05 14:31:08] <Pyrae_K> @Starqu4ke no, you need to do it on each char. And there is a reason for that. Still kinda dumb
[2023-01-05 14:31:09] <%urbish_> PepeLaugh
[2023-01-05 14:31:20] <%turtleandfish> @NomadHook i thought you can buy all legos, but they cost a crazy amount of premium currency?
[2023-01-05 14:31:24] <%$TheOneBlackThor> Hopefully he will enjoy it eventhough he might not play it
[2023-01-05 14:31:25] <%+TottWriter> Map completion is only important if you want legendary gear
[2023-01-05 14:31:27] <baggytrousers> PepeLaugh
[2023-01-05 14:31:27] <+Klyka> you are missing stuff in the Lodge
[2023-01-05 14:31:27] <Radium_Lavans> God been years i did this map but its still in my mind where everything is
[2023-01-05 14:31:28] <+Daemonson> It looks like you havent explored part north of osenfold shear
[2023-01-05 14:31:32] <%+TottWriter> ...or if you wanna farm transmutation charges
[2023-01-05 14:31:35] <+Shierufa> @Preachlfw the water coilor bits are areas that you havent explored
[2023-01-05 14:31:39] <mett7> he needs to learn spot part of maps that are blured
[2023-01-05 14:31:40] <@%Methuzahla> He's gonna acceidentally find out how to flash the ones he hasnt done isnt he guys... isnt he guys
[2023-01-05 14:31:41] <Wolrus> @Starqu4ke sadly it is not, but once u complete it once u get 2 gifts of exploration for legendary crafting and legendaries are account bound
[2023-01-05 14:31:42] <Radium_Lavans> nope
[2023-01-05 14:31:43] <%$BetaFlame00> @NomadHook a crazy amount of gold, and not all.
[2023-01-05 14:31:44] <+RinMatrix> thats a different map LUL
[2023-01-05 14:31:45] <%+ColdIceCreamMan> Was ist das?
[2023-01-05 14:31:46] <Radium_Lavans> different map xD
[2023-01-05 14:31:48] <ethanlee_33> was ist das? monkaHmm
[2023-01-05 14:31:50] <Starqu4ke> @Starqu4ke Sadge , every mmo should be like ff and nw and let you do every class in 1 char, i hate alts
[2023-01-05 14:31:53] <Amokong> Das ist die n√§chste Zone
[2023-01-05 14:31:54] <+Seriade> it was all in the middle you did not explore

[2023-01-05 14:32:01] <%vitsmad> @Methuzahla Dont count on it :)
[2023-01-05 14:32:09] <DoctorPall> look for oddly colored parts of the zone
[2023-01-05 14:32:11] <Starqu4ke> blind KEKL
[2023-01-05 14:32:17] <%NomadHook> @NomadHook Gen 1 and 3 leges you can buy (they cost gold though not gems as you are buying from the auction house), gen 2 you can't outright buy. But yes, very expensive
[2023-01-05 14:32:18] <%+TottWriter> @Starqu4ke GW2 basically throws level up items at you so you can roll alts super fast
[2023-01-05 14:32:18] <+Daemonson> They dont show up if you arent in the zone
[2023-01-05 14:32:18] <+Klyka> there is stuff in the Great Lodge you didnt get
[2023-01-05 14:32:19] <%Shelana95> Wrong zone
[2023-01-05 14:32:21] <Radium_Lavans> Can only see it when you are in that map
[2023-01-05 14:32:21] <+RinMatrix> you cant see it cause youre in a different map

[2023-01-05 14:32:23] <Ogarra> you dont see it outside of the map
[2023-01-05 14:32:30] <+gnorbob> mouseover the uncompleted icons on left to make unfinished ones on the map shine for a brief moment (mouse on off to make it shine repeatedly)
[2023-01-05 14:32:30] <%turtleandfish> @NomadHook well thats fair, ty for the answers
[2023-01-05 14:32:30] <+zacharyeick> need to zone in
[2023-01-05 14:32:32] <+Seja> You don't see uncompleted things from another zone

[2023-01-05 14:32:43] <+Raven451> in Molensk is a vista
[2023-01-05 14:32:44] <Wolrus> @NomadHook u can buy Gen1 Legendaries for gold it does cost a lot, but for other Legos I think u can only buy parts and part of resources
[2023-01-05 14:32:45] <Amokong> Anywhere where there's that smeared texture on the map it's not yet discovered.
[2023-01-05 14:32:48] <JaskoChaerin> @starqu4ke you dont really need full map completion anyway,getting the waypoints you actually need doesnt take long
[2023-01-05 14:32:49] <@%Methuzahla> I never bothered crafting a leggo even though my character is like 10 years old PepeLaugh
[2023-01-05 14:32:59] <+Seriade> @Preachlfw just north of where the green turns to white on the map are suff you have not explored
[2023-01-05 14:32:59] <+Sleepingsniper9> Just got here what class did he pick?
[2023-01-05 14:32:59] <wowmuchtwitcher> @Starqu4ke part of that is because there are unique story trees for race and character creation options
[2023-01-05 14:32:59] <%$BetaFlame00> @NomadHook @NomadHook you also cant buy armor, accessories or backpack legos.
[2023-01-05 14:33:00] <hubbathegrate> @Starqu4ke Yeah having all the classes in one character is just fantastic.
[2023-01-05 14:33:02] <@%Methuzahla> do want one of the older bows and I saw the Nevermore staff and omfg
[2023-01-05 14:33:06] <Dalmerica> if you hover over the symbol on the left it should sparkle and show the general area you need to be
[2023-01-05 14:33:10] <%turtleandfish> the only lego i ever thought of getting was the unicorn bow
[2023-01-05 14:33:12] <NikeGipple> expected first zone completion: 5 hours
[2023-01-05 14:33:15] <Radium_Lavans> i got 100% map on all my chars
[2023-01-05 14:33:17] <%NomadHook> @Methuzahla Same, I am also and altoholic so I can't commit to a single weapon
[2023-01-05 14:33:19] <%turtleandfish> but the rest, i was ehh
[2023-01-05 14:33:21] <%Armazzle1> Looks really pretty
[2023-01-05 14:33:27] <Wolrus> @turtleandfish :D
[2023-01-05 14:33:29] <+Shierufa> @Preachlfw  The parts of the map that are less detailed (still water colored) are unexplored.
[2023-01-05 14:33:33] <%Shelana95> Nah
[2023-01-05 14:33:34] <skryah> @Methuzahla the moment I saw the incinerator dagger I absolutely knew I had to get one
[2023-01-05 14:33:35] <Fronali> unicorn bow on renegade with the multi-shot skills is extremely funny
[2023-01-05 14:33:36] <brucemalt> @Methuzahla they do offer some nice convenience, and they mostly give a nice goal to work towards if you want to player more anyway.
[2023-01-05 14:33:40] <%+Awerlu> Preach's true weakness, caves.
[2023-01-05 14:33:40] <@%Methuzahla> Cant remember the bow I want, its an older white one. leaves little footprints!
[2023-01-05 14:33:45] <%$BetaFlame00> i used to play this pretty heavily. I have 5 gen 1 lego weapons
[2023-01-05 14:33:45] <Radium_Lavans> was even that you needed the pvp maps for it as well xD
[2023-01-05 14:33:48] <Wizzzdem> just blind

[2023-01-05 14:34:31] <+pocketdimension> @Preachlfw the only thing being higher level does is let you have more skills scaled down to the zone level

[2023-01-05 14:34:34] <%+Awerlu> Yep preach doesnt know what a cave is
[2023-01-05 14:34:34] <+zatie_> On the left hand of the map under your zone header. If you hover over points you are missing they will briefly glow on the map even if they are in unexplored parts of the map. still have to search for them but can make it a little easer.
[2023-01-05 14:34:34] <@%Methuzahla> but man the Nevermore staff with the ravens on top... I dont even use a staff and  I neeeeeed

[2023-01-05 14:37:43] <DoctorPall> @ashentale well yeah, but again our ancesters were kinda blindly following the comunist propoganda
[2023-01-05 14:37:47] <@%Methuzahla> @Shelana95 Noooooo,  my norn is 10 years old

[2023-01-05 14:38:02] <shytam> I remember being skeptical when I picked this up and only using the trial version the first couple of weeks
[2023-01-05 14:38:09] <hschuckerbee> I'm afraid I'm gona see 100% and the JP isn't required iirc this zone correctly
[2023-01-05 14:38:09] <%Shelana95> Yea a big one

[2023-01-05 14:38:13] <zeruel24> game got few layers that you can switch on map, works different then wow with random caves
[2023-01-05 14:38:14] <Radium_Lavans> Wait yeah there is a jumping puzzle on this map
[2023-01-05 14:38:16] <%+meriwidget> my adorable lil Asura just hit 80 woohoo!

[2023-01-05 14:38:20] <ashentale> @DoctorPall im more mad with being blind motes tbh :D
[2023-01-05 14:38:21] <%+enikma_> @Viminal There's a lot from previous expansions which is on par in difficulty with at least ex trials and some savage bosses in FF14, but only a few bosses per year and maybe one of them really difficult
[2023-01-05 14:38:24] <%Tetra85> MIGHT makes me RIGHT
[2023-01-05 14:38:26] <zeruel24> @shytam you got expansions yet?

[2023-01-05 14:38:26] <NikeGipple> event
[2023-01-05 14:38:30] <Viminal> idk how to define hard tbh, a combination of interesting bosses and complicated rotations i guess
[2023-01-05 14:38:32] <fgprijgiodfflgrf> newer content is designed around having proper party comps so it might seem difficult at first

[2023-01-05 14:39:15] <%+OldManEnglish> Tomorrow will be chat on
[2023-01-05 14:39:16] <zeruel24> @shytam ah i thought you are new player

[2023-01-05 14:39:29] <Radium_Lavans> I started in gw1 then played some wow then gw2 then mixed it all up started ffxiv and now I just play what I feel like for a couple of months and switch

[2023-01-05 14:47:50] <%NomadHook> @Dalmerica 15 if you count weapon swap (which you should), and any additional you get for your specific profession / legend swap / attunements. GW2 has a deceptive number of active skills
[2023-01-05 14:47:50] <iDontFly> also you can respec really quick so at endgame youll have multiple builds optmized for the encounter

[2023-01-05 15:25:51] <+zero47hk> @freakytk yes for the start its a good idea. and take the boost and unlocks mounts and then start a new char
[2023-01-05 15:25:53] <Tonyryka23> u can buy the black lion chest from trade 2
[2023-01-05 15:25:55] <%Vinestra28> will mike dye his gear
[2023-01-05 15:25:57] <%+TottWriter> @Teorino1984 No, that's just regular level weapons, but because he can eventually use that weapon type it says that instead of "you can't use this"

[2023-01-05 15:26:04] <SoFisht> @Teorino1984 no, its giving him weapons that are exclusive to certain sub specs.
[2023-01-05 15:26:05] <Shrenko> dismantle stuff
[2023-01-05 15:26:09] <wowmuchtwitcher> @freakytk there are 2 bundles 1 with 2 expacs and one with the latest one, i would say try the core game first, if you like it buy all the expacs
[2023-01-05 15:26:10] <SoFisht> like using 2 2hs on a fury warrior
[2023-01-05 15:26:14] <+road_gold> @Teorino1984 I think it's just his particular class cant use that weapon type until one of their special specs, not 100% sure

[2023-01-05 15:26:29] <+freakytk> ok thanks guys1

[2023-01-05 15:26:39] <SoFisht> @Teorino1984 basically, weapons are restricted by class, but subspecs expand your options.
[2023-01-05 15:26:39] <+road_gold> @Teorino1984 prob just a generic drop that would drop for everyone
[2023-01-05 15:26:39] <%+mobbeh> I've missed a lot today, did it not have a salvaging tutorial at any point?

[2023-01-05 15:26:49] <%+OldManEnglish> @road_gold Yes different classes unlock different weapons
[2023-01-05 15:26:49] <creativityx> revenant in general is very linear in terms of gear so there shouldn't be any issue lol
[2023-01-05 15:27:01] <%+OldManEnglish> He can't use that weapon on that class until he unlocks a level 80 subclass
[2023-01-05 15:27:14] <%turtleandfish> @road_gold correct, at level 80, you have access to elite specializations that use new weapon types, so the game is saying that you cant use the shield cos you dont have the spec

[2023-01-05 15:30:02] <+fubous7> xddTree Very true
[2023-01-05 15:30:03] <+Xadia> gets better after base game
[2023-01-05 15:30:04] <Vtreosa> Worst race story and va KEKL
[2023-01-05 15:30:04] <SoFisht> the delivery in the base story is definitely not ideal
[2023-01-05 15:30:05] <mattakola> you choose the worst one tbh LUL
[2023-01-05 15:30:05] <%Neroniss_> story gets so much better after base game
[2023-01-05 15:30:05] <%+Drathas> It gets better after Living World 1
[2023-01-05 15:30:05] <+Grimmov> story gets pretty OK later and worth playing in Heart of Thorns
[2023-01-05 15:30:06] <AdrikRuk> Norn story is not good.
[2023-01-05 15:30:07] <%+Taelan_> Somehow I feel like MMOs feel so much lighter and more fun when you have no idea what you're doing xD
[2023-01-05 15:30:07] <%roseONE> I AM GIANT KING POOGERS
[2023-01-05 15:30:08] <+Shrugal> Expansion stories are much better
[2023-01-05 15:30:08] <+Koraboros> are you going to try all aspects of the game (pvp, pve - solo, party).
[2023-01-05 15:30:08] <morlilo> expansion story is amazing
[2023-01-05 15:30:09] <fgprijgiodfflgrf> the quality improves vastly with expansions
[2023-01-05 15:30:09] <+Razzin_> no one ever plays GW2 for story
[2023-01-05 15:30:10] <+golden_tube> yeah everyone loves treehorn
[2023-01-05 15:30:10] <baggytrousers> gw2 gameplay Pog gw2 story KEKW
[2023-01-05 15:30:11] <%Dreamboum> @Radium_Lavans KEKL
[2023-01-05 15:30:12] <Skyle4f> The story becomes better after the base game story
[2023-01-05 15:30:13] <+saimast> other races have good story start
[2023-01-05 15:30:13] <Dootkin> it'll be abit better after season 2, i think
[2023-01-05 15:30:14] <%+BigstrongboiTV> base story sucks, xpac/living world story is great
[2023-01-05 15:30:15] <nattycakes85> Leveling story sucks. Expansion stories better
[2023-01-05 15:30:16] <Tonyryka23> u need to wepeons swap
[2023-01-05 15:30:17] <CYNIC308> Norn warrior women is meh voice actress
[2023-01-05 15:30:19] <+cdk058> is gw2 holy trinity mmo?
[2023-01-05 15:30:20] <Xann7> I kinda like the asuran one
[2023-01-05 15:30:21] <Northreyar> Base game story is p bad and you chose the worst one also Sadge
[2023-01-05 15:30:21] <AdrikRuk> Charr Sylvary and Human stories and much better
[2023-01-05 15:30:22] <%Geri_0123> But you kinda picked the worst starting story and VA
[2023-01-05 15:30:23] <+road_gold> the casual combat is really dope
[2023-01-05 15:30:24] <+Mawanaki> u should see Guild Wars 1 dialog lol
[2023-01-05 15:30:25] <%TheRealJinjix> @Preachlfw Its an ARR situation
[2023-01-05 15:30:25] <%beskarsilver> It's like an ARR / HW scenario
[2023-01-05 15:30:27] <Lctl10> combat gets worse as you progress imho :P
[2023-01-05 15:30:27] <+StoicPJ> Story gets better after Heart of Thorns
[2023-01-05 15:30:27] <neopolitan_eagle> core story is bad beside lw 1 but the expacs are realy good
[2023-01-05 15:30:28] <+saimast> how do you like the mount
[2023-01-05 15:30:32] <%Shelana95> Accept my friend request ;)
[2023-01-05 15:30:32] <+chaosemperordragoneote> its like a realm reborn. gets better after the base game
[2023-01-05 15:30:32] <%+Warsaint87> @Preachlfw I missed the start of the stream. What made you choose Revenant?
[2023-01-05 15:30:33] <@%+ChunkeyNinja> suppose its like FF where the VA is trash early on
[2023-01-05 15:30:34] <SoFisht> nah the combat is so fuckin fun
[2023-01-05 15:30:34] <orophia> you are basically playing through content from 2012 so its not too bad
[2023-01-05 15:30:37] <%+Adriannn_11> PepeLaugh ARR voice acting
[2023-01-05 15:30:38] <Eadine> story is like ARR where the initial game has some issues
[2023-01-05 15:30:39] <+hayvex> the PVP in GW is amazing
[2023-01-05 15:30:41] <+jacooners> what class is this?
[2023-01-05 15:30:43] <Vandristine> yeah i'd say until 60+ the story isnt great. expansions are very good, havent gotten end of dragons yet
[2023-01-05 15:30:43] <%+nvwls> all the good voice acting was used on the Charr
[2023-01-05 15:30:46] <TheDervlin> the combat is the soul of this game
[2023-01-05 15:30:47] <+ThirteenEra> @Methuzahla Any way to gently nudge him towards finding jumping puzzles? I highly doubt he will realise they exist on his own lol
[2023-01-05 15:30:47] <DoctorPall> voice acting gets better but only in LWS2 i think
[2023-01-05 15:30:47] VIEWERS: 3¬†926
[2023-01-05 15:30:51] <+cenwenki> expansion stories pretty fun
[2023-01-05 15:30:51] <+PorcineProphet> @Lctl10 its ok to be wrong
[2023-01-05 15:30:51] <%+TottWriter> Yeah it's a shame that norn story is one of the weakest
[2023-01-05 15:30:52] <ynferno1> @Preachlfw you can use /wiki command and type item name after it like /wiki Iron Ore and it will open wiki page about item it is super useful when you wonder if you can sell or throw away stuff
[2023-01-05 15:30:53] <Aromberion> Male Sylvari is rated to have the best voice acting
[2023-01-05 15:30:55] <%NomadHook> @jacooners revenent
[2023-01-05 15:30:56] <+Xadia> @cdk058 not really, there are tanks and healers but the comps are more build around keeping buff uptime.
[2023-01-05 15:30:58] <Kirzan> You like speed? Your in for a treat :)
[2023-01-05 15:30:59] <Northreyar> @ChunkeyNinja Pretty much, also Norn is like, the weakest Race story
[2023-01-05 15:31:00] <Orphielle> play Ele ^^
[2023-01-05 15:31:01] <%+Teorino1984> it feels like it plays closer to an ARPG than most MMOs
[2023-01-05 15:31:03] <SoFisht> @orophia legendary sodapoppin mod and HTCM clearer orophia evoMindBlown
[2023-01-05 15:31:03] <xnikri> are u looking foward to the endcontnent of the game?
[2023-01-05 15:31:06] <baggytrousers> Mailbox filling up xddTree
[2023-01-05 15:31:06] <%dramapunk> arr is a good comparison for the story, it gets better with xpacks
[2023-01-05 15:31:07] <%+Adriannn_11> Remember Alisaie voice acting in coils üíÄ
[2023-01-05 15:31:08] <0rektquiem> i think gw2 has the best combat in the mmo genre bar BDO imo
[2023-01-05 15:31:10] <%+TottWriter> I mean, female sylvari is Jennifer Hale
[2023-01-05 15:31:10] <+lalandir> Rev has probably lowest number of skills
[2023-01-05 15:31:10] <%turtleandfish> @cdk058 nope, there are some classes that have support/healer gameplay styles, but no tank, healer, deeps
[2023-01-05 15:31:14] <Kanyusi> ele PepeLaugh
[2023-01-05 15:31:15] <+Mustache_Mat> what other classes are you interested in?
[2023-01-05 15:31:16] <+chaosemperordragoneote> every weapon has unique skills. thats what matters
[2023-01-05 15:31:17] <+Koraboros> are you going to try all aspects of hte game (pvp, pve).
[2023-01-05 15:31:18] <%urbish_> its 2012 so the equivalent of like mop i guess
[2023-01-05 15:31:18] <TheRealCrappyGamer> video froze?

[2023-01-05 15:32:00] <+PorcineProphet> @turtleandfish thats not really true either. You can 100% play tank, healer dps. Tanking just functions differently and only really applies to some instanced content

[2023-01-05 15:32:18] <ookookdook> yeah that's gw2 in a nutshell, so much of it is singleplayer until endgame
[2023-01-05 15:32:18] <+Grimmov> what level is the first instanced dungeon?
[2023-01-05 15:32:19] <%NocturnalLogic> PepeLaugh

[2023-01-05 15:32:21] <+zatie_> Dungeons starts at 35 i think
[2023-01-05 15:32:21] <+Dravot> So when I played I just couldn't do it because of the movement.  It felt "strange".  Seems you were able to get past that.
[2023-01-05 15:32:22] <+kalamari__> dungeons on 30, world bosses are on a timer
[2023-01-05 15:32:22] <eternalyak> it will never come PepeLaugh

[2023-01-05 15:32:31] <+GroovyGengar> You'll need to wait for the big zone meta events over the dungeons, the dungeons in base aren't that great

[2023-01-05 15:32:51] <wowmuchtwitcher> MSQ will take you to other zones
[2023-01-05 15:32:53] <Dalmerica> dungeons are optional pretty sure. also ez plowable now a days.
[2023-01-05 15:32:55] <orophia> @MightyTeapot its time to meddle sodaCult
[2023-01-05 15:32:57] <Powerlord> The story will eventually force you to move to other zones, but you don't actually have to complete them
[2023-01-05 15:33:00] <Tonyryka23> u need to open male
[2023-01-05 15:33:03] <popdamollyy> @Radium_Lavans @PorcineProphet yes only for raids
[2023-01-05 15:33:03] <annie_sullivan1962> I love how people that didn't even pay attention to the story of guild wars original claim that the dialogue is bad, because it is bad in this one.
[2023-01-05 15:33:10] <einfachnorb> @Preachlfw world boss in the zone you just completed was killed couple of mintes ago. that was some group content :)
[2023-01-05 15:33:15] <+GroovyGengar> I went through GW2 without doing a single dungeon tbf

[2023-01-05 15:33:22] <+StoicPJ> Basically the trinity is based around the boom system. You want a healer, alacrity provider, quickness provider, and dps in instances content like fractals
[2023-01-05 15:33:23] <frume13> @Tonyryka23 Buttery males? No thanks
[2023-01-05 15:33:24] <CYNIC308> 100% a zone will always make you overleveled tho

[2023-01-05 15:33:26] <Mesis> @MightyTeapot HeyGuys
[2023-01-05 15:33:28] <ChrisEnv> This game is warm and cozy, accessible and convenient, but not really immersive. At least when I played it years ago
[2023-01-05 15:33:35] <+Edelritter_> @popdamollyy they kind of do for raids though it's a bit annoying to plan out. tank = highest toughness and there are healer specs that cannot do anything but heal and support
[2023-01-05 15:33:35] <%urbish_> teapot Pog
[2023-01-05 15:33:36] <+RinMatrix> also, story is 100% not even required LUL, you can just map complete to 80 if you want
[2023-01-05 15:33:39] <$Jennovaa> Music btw is from Super Adventure Event where you had teleport to 8/16 bit world. Playing game in game basically

[2023-01-05 15:35:03] <+PorcineProphet> @turtleandfish there really isnt a threat system. Its based on toughness lvl. Bosses will aggro to those with the highest toughness. From there its based on block skills, aegis etc

[2023-01-05 15:57:10] <AyyEros> some chairs are raid stuff
[2023-01-05 15:57:10] <orophia> things that would be rare are infusions maybe, not any mount skins
[2023-01-05 15:57:10] <BigMightyena> Cash Wars 2 KEKW
[2023-01-05 15:57:10] <%Mallas2> a rare thing i think at least when i played was the tentacle chest piece from WvW
[2023-01-05 15:57:10] <SoFisht> a lot of it is cash shop, people just buy with in-game gold
[2023-01-05 15:57:11] <mylodamm> you can buy Gems with in game currency, so everyone can have it
[2023-01-05 15:57:12] <Radium_Lavans> there you go only way to skins
[2023-01-05 15:57:13] <%Brandilath> this is the price you pay for no monthly sub
[2023-01-05 15:57:14] <+KHOHX> he on EU?
[2023-01-05 15:57:15] <%+tek__> yeah u get some thrones from raids
[2023-01-05 15:57:16] <Hizirin> less than 10 % of available in-game skins is gemstore....
[2023-01-05 15:57:17] <+iidaze> but also you can buy cash shop by farming so idk
[2023-01-05 15:57:18] <%+mkluvin1515> But - for a non-sub game, I think most of us will put up w/ this kind of thing
[2023-01-05 15:57:20] <+Mustache_Mat> in wardrobe you can look at all the skins
[2023-01-05 15:57:20] <%urbish_> PepeLaugh
[2023-01-05 15:57:20] <SirUsagi> just skins
[2023-01-05 15:57:21] <%Vinestra28> They cycle in and out
[2023-01-05 15:57:22] <%+nvwls> you have to unlock them first
[2023-01-05 15:57:22] <%+TottWriter> The base mounts are earnt ingame

[2023-01-05 15:57:28] <+Noxxi_Greenrose> @Preachlfw the mounts are game earned, the skins for them are gemstore basically
[2023-01-05 15:57:28] <%Geri_0123> These are just skins, not the actual mounts
[2023-01-05 15:57:28] <%+TottWriter> you just buy the mount skins
[2023-01-05 15:57:28] <wowmuchtwitcher> the mounts are from game but the skins are store

[2023-01-05 15:57:34] <+AnnihilaSEAN> tbh, the only real in game prestige stuff in GW2 seems to be titles
[2023-01-05 15:57:34] <frume13> Mounts from store are only skins, you have to get the base mount separately
[2023-01-05 15:57:34] <WeakdayTV> yes
[2023-01-05 15:57:34] <Slamdzr> they do rotate
[2023-01-05 15:57:35] <baggytrousers> You don't have the actual mounts yet, skins come after
[2023-01-05 15:57:36] <hirodclown> HEED MY WORDS
[2023-01-05 15:57:38] <mett7> yes
[2023-01-05 15:57:41] <%+mobbeh> the base mounts are all unlocked via gameplay, skins cycle in/out on the store
[2023-01-05 15:57:41] <+YunhaoPrime> They don't give the mount either, just the skin
[2023-01-05 15:57:43] <+saimast> you get mounts from the game, the skins are from the store

[2023-01-05 16:00:43] <orophia> but you can farm gold and convert to gems to buy gemstore items its not too bad
[2023-01-05 16:00:44] <wowmuchtwitcher> theres alot of store stuff that no one buys

[2023-01-05 16:00:48] <MortyQ> you can buy gems with gold
[2023-01-05 16:00:49] <Shrenko> its not bad
[2023-01-05 16:00:49] <carpetsplurge> most people transmog their permanent armor
[2023-01-05 16:00:49] <Radium_Lavans> they make money from all those mount skins around you XD
[2023-01-05 16:00:49] <RaviisX> I wouldn't transmutate at such a low level
[2023-01-05 16:00:49] <%EPBossMan> @Preachlfw outfits cost nothing to put on, but single armour bits do
[2023-01-05 16:00:50] <+pacotaco91> mighty teapot has a good video on cash shop

[2023-01-05 16:00:54] <%Eeisal> The cash shop is why I don't play GW2 anymore.
[2023-01-05 16:00:55] <baggytrousers> It's not as scummy as you might think

[2023-01-05 16:00:58] <%NomadHook> You can convert gold to gems
[2023-01-05 16:00:59] <frume13> skins use charges, dyeing stuff is free

[2023-01-05 16:01:00] <life_synthesizer> @life_synthesizer I bought it off someone so I dont have to spend shit LUL
[2023-01-05 16:01:00] <+Barry_onyx> build templates is the worst offender
[2023-01-05 16:01:00] <+ikillomega> no sub fee
[2023-01-05 16:01:01] <ravalesh> a bit scummy, yeah
[2023-01-05 16:01:02] <adramael> you can buy everything with gold @Preachlfw
[2023-01-05 16:01:03] <lightriver29> GW2 isn't scummy but has flaws
[2023-01-05 16:01:03] <zeruel24> YOU CAN CONVERT GOLD FOR GEMS TO BUY BAG SLOTS ETC
[2023-01-05 16:01:07] <mad_tyrrok> legendary armor can be transmuted without transmutation charges

[2023-01-05 16:01:08] <+Grimmov> The monetization is pretty excessive
[2023-01-05 16:01:10] <Radium_Lavans> And cash store
[2023-01-05 16:01:10] <Trafikk_> you can BUY everything in the store from ingame gold... you can buy gems with Gold

[2023-01-05 16:01:12] <+Zweeble> it's really good. there's 1-2 items that improve QoL quite a lot, but other than that it's fine
[2023-01-05 16:01:14] <Shrenko> you can exchange gold to ingame shop diamonds @Preachlfw
[2023-01-05 16:01:16] <bash127> i love there is no sub and you choose to buy stuff
[2023-01-05 16:01:16] <+ikillomega> No sub so some MX's are okay
[2023-01-05 16:01:18] <+Mustache_Mat> alot of stuff is Character bound and not account bound when it comes to bag slots and build templates so be careful
[2023-01-05 16:01:18] <BigMightyena> Gecko is Pog

[2023-01-05 16:01:26] <$Lushly> We‚Äôll if you consider you buy a little each month instead of a sub, it‚Äôs pretty reasonable. That being said there is some worthless expensive stuff in that storyle

[2023-01-05 16:01:28] <+zacharyeick> You can convert gold to gems so you can supplement a lot of the stuff just by playing if you choose. The build template stuff is a bit crap

[2023-01-05 16:01:33] <Vestina> The big problem I have is that there are rarely good rewards in-game.
[2023-01-05 16:01:33] <+vandal13> Generally at a certain point you buy gems with in-game gold.
[2023-01-05 16:01:34] <%Shelana95> You can not inspect in this game
[2023-01-05 16:01:35] <%Vinestra28> NOPERS No inspecting
[2023-01-05 16:01:37] <Shrenko> GW2 > WOW :)

[2023-01-05 16:01:37] <orophia> the star is map completion, the number is mastery levels
[2023-01-05 16:01:37] <skryah> @Amandagray825 so in the end you are paying with time, and time = money, so
[2023-01-05 16:01:39] <+kgbarret> I saw a 455 two days ago
[2023-01-05 16:01:39] <JuanPunch> there is no gear check in the game because casuals think it's toxic

[2023-01-05 16:01:43] <Starqu4ke> @zeruel24 who tf wants to farm gold? might as well get a min wage part time job for 1 week to buy everything
[2023-01-05 16:01:44] <+MsBungle> mastery is like a horizontal progression system beyond your character level
[2023-01-05 16:01:46] <Skyle4f> No inspection because its "Too toxic"

[2023-01-05 16:07:30] <Greenpearlzz> you need expansion for elite specialisations
[2023-01-05 16:07:30] <+cenwenki> raids end stuffs
[2023-01-05 16:07:33] <Plenyx> @orophia FeelsGoodMan
[2023-01-05 16:07:34] <twighly> The subclasses are fun.
[2023-01-05 16:07:36] <%Shelana95> No that was expantions you bought
[2023-01-05 16:07:36] <SoFisht> They didnt take them out, they were temporary
[2023-01-05 16:07:37] <Greenpearlzz> and raids
[2023-01-05 16:07:41] <skryah> @adramael I literally have 7000 hours in this game, leave me alone dumass
[2023-01-05 16:07:41] <%yashiru_> @Preachlfw they remade it cuz originally it was made to be ever changing world
[2023-01-05 16:07:42] <baggytrousers> They messed up pretty bad on content releases
[2023-01-05 16:07:44] <Siggi_EMP> tldr: if you're unsure if gw2 is for you play the free trial and if you want to commit go for the complete collection or you will feel annoyed for the living world being sold separately
[2023-01-05 16:07:45] <Kanyusi> NODDERS Living world season 1
