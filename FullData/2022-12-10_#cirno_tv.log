[2022-12-10 02:09:02] <TrebleZX> FO2 was fun if you use the unofficial patch, base game had a game breaking but that at somepoint a key NPC could get deleted and you had no way to know and your file would be borked forever

[2022-12-10 20:49:02] <%defski> One time when I was on a southwest airlines flight I needed to use the restroom, but the door wouldn't budge despite being marked as vacant. After like 30 seconds of trying to get it open I heard a flush and cirno trundled out carrying a cinderblock. I asked him why he had something so strange in the bathroom, and he said "I need to block the door so bad guys can't get in and take pictures of me". I will never understand why people support this guy, he is violent and unstable.
