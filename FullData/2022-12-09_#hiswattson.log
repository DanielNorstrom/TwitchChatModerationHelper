[2022-12-09 15:28:20] <+HoppyWasHere> Like, you can have free health care and potentially have a wait list or, just like in america, you can buy private healthcare that gets higher levels of access. So obviously having a public level of healthcare is always superior.
[2022-12-09 15:28:24] <Naicii> When I fractured my wrist, I had a 20‚Ç¨ appointment at the local GP who gave me a free referral for a scan, and I had a brace for it in 2 days @HisWattson

[2022-12-09 16:30:28] <%LargeBooba> The more boosters there are, the more people play the game, it‚Äôs the same with skins. After people ‚Äòinvest‚Äô financially in the game, they‚Äôre much more likely to keep playing, so they won‚Äôt do anything about boosters
[2022-12-09 16:30:32] <zxReid> did the former rank 1 cheater get banned?

[2022-12-09 16:31:01] <%+jesse_fps> Do closet cheaters get banned? like what does the effectiveness of someone having just wallhacks have on the game? if someone was using only wallhacks and they can hide it i cant imagine its very easy to ban those players. I dont play high level though so maybe my opinion is just wrong idk
[2022-12-09 16:31:01] <Piiitha> what is the top 50 thing?
[2022-12-09 16:31:08] <MyNameizViN> hey wattson, is grinding from diamond 4 to masters worth the time if going at it solo or should i lfg the grind? any advice?
[2022-12-09 16:31:11] <saola> Still think the Sao Pao preds should be "punished"

[2022-12-09 17:47:30] <+m0nkene> Lacrosse was started by the Native American Indians and was originally known as stickball. The game was initially played in the St. Lawrence Valley area by the Algonquian tribe and they were followed by other tribes in the eastern half of North America, and around the western Great Lakes.

[2022-12-09 17:57:29] <b0n3sawmcsizzla> Yes indeed a good game of Apex is much like the game of Chess. From the deceptive placement of the Pawn, to the galant stride of the Kniight in conjunction with other power pieces such as the Rook or Queen and Bishop. It is really about outsdmarting and outmaneuvering your opponent
