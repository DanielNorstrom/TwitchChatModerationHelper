[2023-01-06 10:08:47] <%$fullerk55> And it was also reported that in the code they just have a small chance, so it is hard to tell
[2023-01-06 10:09:44] <%$fullerk55> But typically if someone says they are on a map, and you want them it is best to play that map, you will either find them there because they spawn that day, or because they had a small chance. worth it though

[2023-01-06 15:29:37] <+beardedvamp> @whmatt I said you die at LIKE .4. BAC 0.30% to 0.40%: In this percentage range, you'll likely have alcohol poisoning, a potentially life-threatening condition, and experience loss of consciousness. BAC Over 0.40%: This is a potentially fatal blood alcohol level.

[2023-01-06 15:49:30] <%ciditi> honestly they should make the boss spawns scale with the # of active players that have the quest to kill em. The more people looking, the higher the % chance. Makes the map more dangerous for everyone else too, which imo a good thing

My brother Cornelius Bartholomew Anderson ringle got caught in an alberian twitch prime and bits scam and got sent to the gulag, but we've snuck him a Nokia 3310 in his ass with a spoon that he'll be using to plan a breakout with my cousin longsdale dimmsdimone slingle.

[2023-01-06 19:00:37] <airwreck117> ive deflected 55a1 with peen helm
[2023-01-06 19:00:39] <+eazyxl> sorry im out of the loop, what's a penis helmet?
[2023-01-06 19:00:40] <%Lamspread> check vod
[2023-01-06 19:00:41] <%ShrapNL> 7.62 ps has been one tapping for me
[2023-01-06 19:00:43] <fromthekron> level doesnt matter when it comes to ricochet
[2023-01-06 19:00:45] <bathory_wt> Ricochet doesn't depend on armor class. Kondors can bounce mosin rounds
[2023-01-06 19:00:47] <+Sefferpickle> its pretty common when you stream tho
[2023-01-06 19:00:51] <+marijewannna> apparantly not that rare LUL
[2023-01-06 19:00:51] <MerckQT> scavs are just hacking , obviously.
[2023-01-06 19:00:56] <%ArturoGJ> It's really rare and he would've moved and not be able to aim with the concussion debuff
[2023-01-06 19:00:56] <MerckQT> Check the VOD @Trey24k
[2023-01-06 19:00:56] <+beelzebub13> richochet chance isnt affected by armor rating tho?
[2023-01-06 19:01:00] <%+king_coolboi> Ive always gotten a ton of ricochets with a penis helmet. I'm not sure pen effects ricochet chance
[2023-01-06 19:01:01] <fromthekron> @bathory_wt thats exactly what Im saying too.
[2023-01-06 19:01:01] <brandooo> why are  utaking such a good gun if your doing no armor challenge?
[2023-01-06 19:01:07] <%$turdburgler3000> i've deflected m61 with a peen before
[2023-01-06 19:01:10] <GaDontBin> I deflected m993 with condor i was on private fighting my friendhaha
