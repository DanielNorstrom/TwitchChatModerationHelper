[2023-01-05 16:10:06] <%+Warn3rguy> Unless you line up the edges and don't offset them.
[2023-01-05 16:10:07] <%Mackapoot> So a 1 block gap between the tiles

[2023-01-05 16:10:35] <%+blackedoutpaul> youll have weird lengths at the edge so it doesnt really matter
[2023-01-05 16:10:36] <%ChiefShake> Looks good, but it's going to be covered by lava/fire

[2023-01-05 16:11:17] <MarsterB> But how are you going to light it up so you can see it with the glass on top also
[2023-01-05 16:11:17] <InflatableSmells> By subtracting where not to put the fire or something
[2023-01-05 16:11:18] <%+tarrantking289> thats ok
[2023-01-05 16:11:21] <%ChiefShake> and you know what? That is fine
[2023-01-05 16:11:21] <fatdonkey77> Make panels even number
[2023-01-05 16:11:22] <%Klorkin9> Don't double up the grey
[2023-01-05 16:11:23] <%st_samples> Offset it a 2/3 ratio
[2023-01-05 16:11:27] <bearded_gamerdad420> Yolo
[2023-01-05 16:11:28] <%malibumomma> Because you’ll have odd edges on the circle you should make it random everywhere
[2023-01-05 16:11:29] <%StrikerCo> unacceptable. delete world
[2023-01-05 16:11:32] <%st_samples> move it two blocks right

[2023-01-05 16:11:38] <!%$spunkyjethro> Do just 1 block
[2023-01-05 16:11:41] <Palmerzannn> of set it by just 5 so its like diagonal not square
[2023-01-05 16:11:44] <%+lowrescre8s> it’ll look better that way
[2023-01-05 16:11:50] <%+Warn3rguy> Put a black "seam" between the tiles.
[2023-01-05 16:11:51] <Palmerzannn> 5 from the edge
[2023-01-05 16:11:52] <%$SamTheCellist> UNACCEPTABLE. DELETE WORLD OR bamRITO

[2023-01-05 16:11:55] <shantypioneer> Could put an extra dark between the 2 making it 3
[2023-01-05 16:11:58] <vanndam85> just make one block strip an have them share. you won't be able to tell
[2023-01-05 16:12:00] <%+tarrantking289> It will be ok, a little offset like that is negligible.
[2023-01-05 16:12:03] <%st_samples> @Palmerzannn This
[2023-01-05 16:12:04] <%$infxmhc2> @SamTheCellist good luck dude

[2023-01-05 16:12:09] <%ChiefShake> weigh too much....
[2023-01-05 16:12:10] <%+jkole0711> Just do it opposite on the other side
[2023-01-05 16:12:11] <%malibumomma> @jonbams Because you’ll have odd edges on the circle you should make it random everywhere
[2023-01-05 16:12:11] <+CraftyJoey> Maybe use a line of grout in between?

The cut-nail process was patented in America by Jacob Perkins in 1795 and in England by Joseph Dyer, who set up machinery in Birmingham. The process was designed to cut nails from sheets of iron, while making sure that the fibres of the iron ran down the nails.

[2023-01-05 16:19:58] <%Thedarkvet53> Cheer100 Cheer100 I just made a huge mistake, i'm sorry jon.  But I have to let you in on the secret.  I googled who is erebus. Although he never actually appeared in any myths of his own, Erebus is one of Greek mythology’s most fascinating foundational characters. With a name meaning ‘shadow’ or ‘darkness,’ Erebus was the primordial god of darkness. One of the first creatures to be born into Greek mythology, he had no form, instead existing in a hovering, ghost-like state.

[2023-01-05 17:59:47] <%RealWickedBrew> The whole point of doing CPR is to keep blood flowing to the brain and organs
[2023-01-05 17:59:47] <%$BurritoMedia> @JonBams we will never know unless he tells us that would violate HIPPA
[2023-01-05 17:59:50] <F1R3H4WK156> @JonBams what if you had done a water drop similar to a sand drop on the floor Kappa

[2023-01-05 17:59:57] <!%erebus56> i mean some of that shit falls under patient doctor confidentiality HIPAA is real and expensive if ignored
[2023-01-05 17:59:58] <EvantrusWB> Let’s be honest, if you had cardiac arrest because of a hit you took while playing football, you most likely wouldn’t want to still play
[2023-01-05 18:00:00] <%BubbaGump_72> I read they had him intubated on the field and was done in about 90 seconds

[2023-01-05 18:00:43] <%+NotTodayFedBoy> The whole system being rigged is more likely than a curse. Which is honestly more believable. Look at how much the NFL makes? Money corrupts

[2023-01-05 18:05:05] <%Moldy_Cheese> I think the creation of Bills Mafia (while it’s origins are a little shitty) have tremendously shifted the culture in Buffalo. Players used to not want to play there: Buffalo was cold, snowy, and gross. Now they WANT to play for those fans. Also the work the city and Pegulas did to revitalize downtown is incredible @jonbams

[2023-01-05 18:07:06] <%Moldy_Cheese> @jonbams I think the creation of Bills Mafia (while it’s origins are a little shitty) have tremendously shifted the culture in Buffalo. Players used to not want to play there: Buffalo was cold, snowy, and gross. Now they WANT to play for those fans. Also the work the city and Pegulas did to revitalize downtown is incredible
