[2022-12-31 06:21:52] <^Nightbot> Specter Tenebria is at the top of every list I see and she completely deserves it. The dark tyrant that requests us lower level humans to kiss her feet. Little did she know I am excited to get the honor to even get close to her spectacular feet. Would I not only kiss her feet but I would personally clean each of her toes by sucking on each one until she is satisfied with the result. I can imagine the smell of roses from her feet as I lick in between her toenails.

[2022-12-31 06:34:14] <Vizjira> one way or another with removing 15% you have to rebalance the game

[2022-12-31 06:35:33] <Vizjira> @hinagikukatsurachan and you have to live through the shitstorm that the community brings on any rebalenced unit that could be considered "nerfed"
[2022-12-31 06:35:41] <WildBerserk> @Evaligon did you look at the set diff?
[2022-12-31 06:35:42] <+GrimTony> I'd rather every debuff max out at 85% success rate. At least it'd plainly written on every skill that it has a 15% chance to fail

[2022-12-31 06:36:48] <^Nightbot> Specter Tenebria is at the top of every list I see and she completely deserves it. The dark tyrant that requests us lower level humans to kiss her feet. Little did she know I am excited to get the honor to even get close to her spectacular feet. Would I not only kiss her feet but I would personally clean each of her toes by sucking on each one until she is satisfied with the result. I can imagine the smell of roses from her feet as I lick in between her toenails.
[2022-12-31 06:36:57] <%Xamess> !yulha
[2022-12-31 06:36:57] <^Nightbot> Yulha is currently popular because 1: She has a 100% provoke on her S1 (krau does not) 2: her S2 lets her full cleanse + gives herself a barrier AND cr push, which essentially guarantees she gets her S3 off at low hp (krau is worthless vs debuffs) 3: her S3 ignores all damage share (including arrowell's escort) + heals her if it kills. She is a solid answer to currently popular units like Lhc, adin, riolet, etc due to how easy it is for her to kill them with her S3

[2022-12-31 06:37:06] <szyazel> !atywin
[2022-12-31 06:37:06] <^Nightbot> I must confess I am guilty of abusing this very common bug known as ATywin SB S3 to get RTA legend. I am sorry to the legitimate non ATywin players out there. I saw an opportunity to create an unfair advantage for myself and I took it. I will accept the 90 day ban that Smilegate has handed out and hope fellow ATywin abusers reflect on their behavior. I hope next season I can qualify legitimately for Epic 7 World Cup without abusing ATywin.

[2022-12-31 06:40:16] <exvreccpwhf> 15% is not high if you’ve played lost ark, try hitting a 15% hone 5 times in a row you’re more likely to pity 5 times in a row it feels like

[2022-12-31 07:40:22] <inferno2918> @Jenazad can we expect they ever nerfing an ML5 again tho?
[2022-12-31 07:40:25] <%greatersociety> Yufine made this meta aggro heavy.   so much for 1.1
[2022-12-31 07:40:32] <%EluciadeLuteIma> that doesnt make sense because they can just only give it back once during the duration of the nerfs
[2022-12-31 07:40:32] <%+Lichtey> ppl forget its "just" a gacha
[2022-12-31 07:40:33] <HzHammy> I understand but like I know some people who loved hwayoung and her kit and now she is bad but im sure if she was balanced to still be good they would be fine

[2022-12-31 07:41:01] <reydedark> clilias does too much
[2022-12-31 07:41:02] <%+WildNeptune> i dont think any ML5s atm are so far above the rest of them that the yare nerfable
[2022-12-31 07:41:03] <%+Lichtey> i agree
[2022-12-31 07:41:07] <pedr_twitch> if they were more willing to have regular updates instead of 5 characters every 2 months, then nerfing buffing wouldn't be such an issue
[2022-12-31 07:41:17] <%greatersociety> bruh I was gonna headhunt Clilias and someone told me they think She's a bait pick and not gonna be good this season Madge

[2022-12-31 07:43:26] <^Nightbot> Specter Tenebria is at the top of every list I see and she completely deserves it. The dark tyrant that requests us lower level humans to kiss her feet. Little did she know I am excited to get the honor to even get close to her spectacular feet. Would I not only kiss her feet but I would personally clean each of her toes by sucking on each one until she is satisfied with the result. I can imagine the smell of roses from her feet as I lick in between her toenails.

[2022-12-31 11:17:19] <^Nightbot> Specter Tenebria is at the top of every list I see and she completely deserves it. The dark tyrant that requests us lower level humans to kiss her feet. Little did she know I am excited to get the honor to even get close to her spectacular feet. Would I not only kiss her feet but I would personally clean each of her toes by sucking on each one until she is satisfied with the result. I can imagine the smell of roses from her feet as I lick in between her toenails.

[2022-12-31 12:21:15] <DaarkPaladinX> So is ML Kawerick is a reason why I see high effectiveness counter AoL most of the time?
[2022-12-31 12:21:15] <Janbay123> is astro elena not good against these counter teams?
[2022-12-31 12:21:41] <%Mr_Sparcler> fire DUHHHWABI is good, but the meta water units...

[2022-12-31 12:22:22] <DaarkPaladinX> @Janbay123 She's very good against counter teams because her anti-counter is a special buff.  She's kinda staple in cleave teams.
[2022-12-31 12:22:23] <NekonearTvPH> thank you!
[2022-12-31 12:22:26] <%Xamess> angelica is very good too ok especially with her EE
