[2022-12-27 02:19:37] <!%$Eric4bz> @Oroboro you can parry with your hand if it's empty. just using the buckler for shield?

[2022-12-27 02:24:16] <%SoupIsTasty5> Normally
[2022-12-27 02:24:19] <@%Pallydan9K> well you can get 3 to 5 casts per playthrough I think
[2022-12-27 02:24:21] <%SoupIsTasty5> Depending on ATN
[2022-12-27 02:24:23] <shushir> You can fill all your slots with them and get like, 15 or so I think?

[2022-12-27 02:24:27] <@%Pallydan9K> yeah depends on ATN

[2022-12-27 02:59:07] <shushir> @Evil_on_Paper Right, I'm just pointing out that the glitch didn't get the ping from the mod earlier, so it would likely not be that, or at least the glitch version
[2022-12-27 02:59:09] <%$KungFuAndrew> Pick axe is one of the best weapons in the game when paired with leo ring

[2022-12-27 03:06:30] <shushir> Hollowing levels also affect your invasion priority: getting invaded while fully hollow is unlikely, but possible.

[2022-12-27 03:08:35] <psychoteletubby7> what's a reasonable vigor in this game?
[2022-12-27 03:08:36] <yogurt_the_succulent_chef> it's their first ds2 playthrough. they will never play it again. Sadge
[2022-12-27 03:08:40] <ObbyDent> elden ring infected their mind
[2022-12-27 03:08:43] <%SoupIsTasty5> Did they?

[2022-12-27 03:08:46] <@%Pallydan9K> new generation kind of low int
[2022-12-27 03:08:47] <+Pubz_evolution> Vigor was the first thing I leveled
[2022-12-27 03:08:48] <Pryban> these are definitely elden ring transplants, judging from the vigor
[2022-12-27 03:08:50] <Clear_Skyy> but you're laggy to him aswell monkaHmm

[2022-12-27 03:08:55] <RogueEleven> vigor is number 1 imo
[2022-12-27 03:08:57] <ExtraRedirect> armor upgrading also makes a difference, pvefrogs don't tend to do that
[2022-12-27 03:09:01] <%+rnblaze> 40-50 was the good range
[2022-12-27 03:09:03] <@%Pallydan9K> I wonder if this is why people say they liked ds3

[2022-12-27 03:09:26] <%$KungFuAndrew> Bruh DS2 is so ez you don't need vigor in the easiest game made by B-Team I know this because my dad at Nintendo said so and he doesn't lvl vigor either because he's not a scrub that needs HP he just does it all SL1 and pwns newbs with a club and -14 vigor

[2022-12-27 03:53:39] <%yugo_kale> the reason there is salt is because you can actually kill the host repeatedly

[2022-12-27 03:55:31] <shushir> @bignatedogg243 It's mostly old hate from forever ago being recycled and a vocal minority getting people to parrot their dumbass talking points.
[2022-12-27 03:55:32] <%KungFuAndrew> @my_dark_humor No, it's single player. It enhances the game for modern systems, it built the code from the ground up so it can be run properly on modern setups. Works with the Steam, GOG, and the old CDs if you still have those
[2022-12-27 03:55:32] <%Kaminoyouni> well no accounting for taste

[2022-12-27 03:57:54] <%KungFuAndrew> @my_dark_humor Yeah, it's really good. Easy to set up, works with about 90% of existing mods, too. A lot of stuff like extended draw distance, 16:9 resolutions is standard. TONS of bug fixes, too, since they reverse engineered the code

[2022-12-27 03:59:53] <shushir> @RunesBlack That's weird, because the literal frame data shows DS1 is way more clunky, same with DES

[2022-12-27 04:00:24] <%+Chaosshield> @RunesBlack hard disagree my man, DS2 was built around pvp compared to the other games where it was tacked on. It's apparent from the design of the stamina and weapon movesets that they actually cared about pvp at a core level

[2022-12-27 04:00:56] <@%Pallydan9K> elden ring has like 30,000 players and barely any can be invaded

[2022-12-27 04:01:33] <@%Pallydan9K> @bobothefool999 because Solo hosts cannot be invaded and there's a offline co-op mod

[2022-12-27 04:01:46] <my_dark_humor> @shushir sadly never got good at parry until the tail end of ds3. need to go back to ds2 and re learn it.... str builds are the best imo
[2022-12-27 04:01:46] <shushir> Elden Ring has a fuckton of overlevelled casuals that can't be invaded by people looking for PvP, yet almost everyone playing DS2 can find activity. How strange
[2022-12-27 04:02:02] <Frizerrl> Can't wait for ds4

[2022-12-27 04:02:16] <shushir> @my_dark_humor STR builds are great in DS2: the STR stat is doubled while two-handing for weapon stat requirements

[2022-12-27 04:02:35] <bobothefool999> @ryane1542 its shocking how alive this game feels, i just finished a playthrough.
[2022-12-27 04:02:38] <my_dark_humor> ds2 was my 1st souls game pincogNoodle saintrFrog
[2022-12-27 04:02:40] <buttsitter> Soul memory and adp are the only overarching negative aspects of this game. It knocks everything else out of the park except a few level designs
[2022-12-27 04:02:53] <shushir> @SeanRAHX I play indie games with SNES graphics, so I may not be the best person to ask, but they're fine yeah
[2022-12-27 04:03:02] <%KungFuAndrew> There's nothing wrong with SM or ADP LUL Come on
[2022-12-27 04:03:02] <Frizerrl> buttsitter W take
[2022-12-27 04:03:10] <Error403> stamina management one reason this game is toptier for pvp you cant just spam r1 or roll and get away easy

[2022-12-27 04:03:15] <%SoupIsTasty5> Good fight tbh

[2022-12-27 05:16:22] <ryane1542> @anom96 they removed building from the game so its just guns and movement

[2022-12-27 05:21:33] <shushir> Yeah, Golden seed is the best unless you know what you're doing, then maybe the stone key is best if you're experienced/ on a 2nd run

[2022-12-27 05:25:27] <@%saintriot> The Bandai Namco press release said "Single Player/Multiplayer" so, I think that counts as confirmation.

[2022-12-27 05:27:33] <shadowblight7> @ryane1542 if we talking easiest souls game in the series it would have to be ds1 in my opinion

[2022-12-27 05:27:34] <shushir> Brazil becomes the main hub for Armored Core PvP outside Japan just to spite Oro
[2022-12-27 05:27:50] <%OptPlaysGames> @shadowblight7 I think demon’s souls is easier just more obtuse
[2022-12-27 05:28:07] <shushir> @shadowblight7 Either DS1 or DS3, I think. Especially if we don't include optional/ DLC content

[2022-12-27 05:28:30] <shadowblight7> @OptPlaysGames I think demon souls bosses are harder normal enemies well backstab cheese exists in both
[2022-12-27 05:28:34] <@%Pallydan9K> If Oro wants to play a fighting game and get 7-1 I can send him to Brazil
[2022-12-27 05:28:51] <shushir> That's actually a good point" DES bosses are mostly piss-easy
[2022-12-27 05:28:54] <ryane1542> @shadowblight7 the areas in ds1 were a lot more challenging for me than the bosses

[2022-12-27 05:31:15] <shadowblight7> @ryane1542 ds2 was groups of enemies rather then traps ds3 has a mix of joke enemies and hard ones and had the hardest bosses between the basic soul series
[2022-12-27 05:31:33] <ryane1542> Ds1 orenstein and smaug were my favorite boss of the series
[2022-12-27 05:31:43] <%KungFuAndrew> same
[2022-12-27 05:31:46] <shadowblight7> so overall ds1 has weak bosses weak enemies and traps that you learn quickly
