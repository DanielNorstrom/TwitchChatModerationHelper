[2022-12-07 17:32:08] <%jackal_ts> @TheRunningManZ ... yeah I agree with you, personal losses after the fact always brings up memory on a certain day... 8 years on, every year I remember my wife. Perhaps after a while it's a good thing, so we can remember the good?

[2022-12-07 17:37:12] <@%Feast_130> Ive had that experience with both my parents @TheRunningManZ
[2022-12-07 17:37:17] <%+Ziegzag> I had EXACTLY the same thing happen to me

[2022-12-07 17:38:24] <%royton_rider> It's weird how little things out of nowhere will remind you and hit you like a brick, I had a proper good cry the other night for my mum, but it kind of helped
[2022-12-07 17:38:26] <%+alcyone92> I thought of it as a sign that things are ok .
[2022-12-07 17:38:36] <%Brother_Garrett> @Feast_130 aah man that sucks, how old are you now if I may ask
