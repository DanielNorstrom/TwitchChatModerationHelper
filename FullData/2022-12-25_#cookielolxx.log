[2022-12-25 17:06:25] <Wexaazys> Ksante wasn't that broken when released, just now with preseason items.
[2022-12-25 17:06:28] <IWiLldOnAtE0> I don't even think aphelios cause k'sante is so easy which is crazy he's so broken and so easy at the same time NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[2022-12-25 17:06:34] <NendouHoudan> he got overbuffed
[2022-12-25 17:06:35] <%manimessi97> he can get kited easily by mobile champs

[2022-12-25 17:06:53] <%jeakiel> @CookieLoLxx they wont fix him cause he has low winnrate in low elo but is dominant in high elo so they go for the low elo players
[2022-12-25 17:06:59] <+superduperluperkool> wukong op now?
[2022-12-25 17:07:02] <%odysseaszervas> u healed him xd

[2022-12-25 17:07:44] <+papaz1> Worst part is they not only gave tanks/bruisers new items but they buffed top lane xp at the same time
[2022-12-25 17:07:46] <danielum02> you went collector, should have gone ldr

[2022-12-25 17:27:28] <%HornyAlune> the problem with scaling that enemy team(adc) feeds from your team and your scales will be so late
[2022-12-25 17:27:28] <%La_Sigma> if the team dies I then try to defend and get dove by 5 people though
[2022-12-25 17:27:52] <Azu260> @la_sigma dont defend ehat you cant defend
[2022-12-25 17:27:52] <KurzedMetal> the problem is that allies NEVER STOP INTING, and more time = more inting

[2022-12-25 18:00:17] <Regrup> @aehspa usually it's when u do cheat recall or have money for it, as early as possible and you know that it will be calm lane or farmfest without much trading

[2022-12-25 18:16:33] <SirFabz> @CookieLoLxx do you think you can make a pretty in depth video on how to fix mmr and lp gains, feels like after a couple games in a row of a jungler or support running it down it torches my mmr for losing so much

[2022-12-25 18:16:53] <+shadowxerianer> @sebbastianstoye In this season adc feels so shit, random support and jgl just being broken atm, makes adc miserable, as you don't have much early/mid game impact

[2022-12-25 18:20:14] <solaceV1> @MarksmanTensai even then, it's pretty risky since you have to put in so much effort and there is no guarantee that your stream will blow up or you'll get picked up by a team. I think it's still worth if it's your dream though
