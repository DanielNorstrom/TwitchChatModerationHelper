[2022-12-16 05:12:25] <+JOK3R6> Character should move and adjust on his broom while flying. He's too stiff.

[2022-12-16 05:14:44] <ShowtimeTylers> @knight_viking I imagine it will have a bit of rock paper scissors element to it, which is fine I wasn't expecting much

[2022-12-16 06:30:22] <xen_mind> im retiring as soon as i can, working is a mug's game
[2022-12-16 06:30:47] <%The3Kingdoms> he wants to die as an CEO - he would rather die in the ring if it was up to Vince in a storyline
[2022-12-16 06:31:03] <techhippie1976> i don' think narcissists understand the concept of "enjoying life". they're only happy when they are controlling others.

[2022-12-16 06:43:28] <%lokenplays> I know this is heretical, but i hope any 40k movie doesn't focus on space marines, and that Cavil plays a non marine or custodies character.

[2022-12-16 06:44:32] <TrulyNotorious> start in the middle at the epic point, do backstory episodes as the main story progresses

[2022-12-16 06:57:19] <xen_mind> Drakseid would smoke superman, not much of a movie
[2022-12-16 06:57:20] <AmericanOnline> baby super man doing super poops
[2022-12-16 06:57:20] <Kealsad> smallvile
[2022-12-16 06:57:23] <%+Nankam> It'll be rebooted again before that new superman ever fights darkside burkeKek
[2022-12-16 06:57:25] <+Sleazymyr> It really depends on what you want out of your supes stories
[2022-12-16 06:57:28] <donne_9> so another smallville
[2022-12-16 06:57:29] <%Lain_2779> so its going to be Lois & Clark tv show type of movie? ?
[2022-12-16 06:57:30] <velimirius> smallville reboot
[2022-12-16 06:57:36] <DurzoBlint1O1> Huge mistake dropping Cavill
[2022-12-16 06:57:37] <%andurated> It's Gonna be Rated Arrrr @burkeblack burkeL
[2022-12-16 06:57:40] <FriscoRPG> i liked smallville
[2022-12-16 06:57:41] <%KodaiRyu> basically Smallville but less
[2022-12-16 06:57:41] <+laurik> So basically it’s gonna be a lame
[2022-12-16 06:57:43] <YaHa_8777> probably defeating homework and exams and finding some girlfriends
[2022-12-16 06:57:46] <KingOfRedNames> superman is just not that interesting
[2022-12-16 06:57:51] <+GarionTheFirstOfHisName> just cut smallville into a couple movies LUL Tom did great in that
[2022-12-16 06:57:54] <ShowtimeTylers> smallville reignited in his vision
[2022-12-16 06:58:03] <ShowtimeTylers> which im not too excited about
[2022-12-16 06:58:05] <AmericanOnline> i want martha burping him and him knocking down the windmill
[2022-12-16 06:58:08] <TrickModeX> any movie can be good if done well.
[2022-12-16 06:58:11] <+Grassroots801> SuperLame!!!
[2022-12-16 06:58:11] <Lerekh> So spiderman 2, juggling the missus while doing superhero stuff
[2022-12-16 06:58:16] <+Sleazymyr> I think they want to save superman fights the galaxy for like justice league stories
[2022-12-16 06:58:18] <+DPeachGaming> james is an idiot
[2022-12-16 06:58:20] <%KodaiRyu> i bet Batman vs Superman is better than that
[2022-12-16 06:58:24] <+MorgrimReaper> my biggest hope is for the phone booth change room for superman
[2022-12-16 06:58:28] <%KodaiRyu> much better
[2022-12-16 06:58:30] <xen_mind> they keep getting away with this stuff becasue you keep tuning in
[2022-12-16 06:58:33] <+Sleazymyr> I get that we want him to punch darkside for one movie, but that can't be your first movie
[2022-12-16 06:58:40] <ShowtimeTylers> @MorgrimReaper that would be a cute homage.
[2022-12-16 06:58:56] <Dankotron> it would be so popular I don't know why they don't do it

[2022-12-16 06:59:31] <+RicoSamurai> henry got cut from witcher and superman...why does it feel like he's being blocked out by hollywood?
[2022-12-16 06:59:32] <%+Nankam> He could if he hadn't done movies already for what gunn wants to do
[2022-12-16 06:59:33] <ShowtimeTylers> 39 is not close to middle age LOL
[2022-12-16 06:59:33] <Dankotron> you can still date 18 year olds at 39
[2022-12-16 06:59:34] <DurzoBlint1O1> Luke Perry was 90 when he was on 90210
[2022-12-16 06:59:42] <+Sleazymyr> They want a 25 year old supes... so they can use him for 10 years
[2022-12-16 06:59:44] <+rucus29> he looks to old
[2022-12-16 06:59:44] <xen_mind> not for actors, almost all of them for the past 30 years ahve been around that age or older
[2022-12-16 06:59:47] <%+vackillers2013> not the superman we want, but its the superman we're gonna get

[2022-12-16 06:59:48] <+crilix> @BurkeBlack yes they can "money is the problem" look what they doing for the new indiana Jones movie making Harris Ford young
[2022-12-16 06:59:52] <MasqureMan> they should just follow the comics and have superboy come and fill in the younger slot
[2022-12-16 06:59:53] <%The3Kingdoms> i'll be 43 soon guess im dying soon, if i listen to chat
[2022-12-16 06:59:53] <TrashPandacoot> end of the line
[2022-12-16 06:59:58] <Asethe> 39 starts getting too old when you're looking at a 10 year shooting cycle

[2022-12-16 07:00:15] <+MorgrimReaper> thier youngifying Harrison ford in the new Indiana Jones.
[2022-12-16 07:00:15] <%+prfella> @BurkeBlack my interpretation is that its a near reboot, hes not continueing where snyder left off, hes starting his own thing, but bypassing the origin stuff, so we will see a different set of events to the snyderverse
[2022-12-16 07:00:16] <$ThatVanillaGorilla> They couldn't hide his mustache lol
[2022-12-16 07:00:16] <ShowtimeTylers> they could have had a new Superman that was younger so they could make more movies for 10 years, just give Cavel Man of Steel 2!
[2022-12-16 07:00:17] <TrashPandacoot> the man's being held together by prosthetics and glue

[2022-12-16 07:21:52] <%+prfella> @mahoraz that comment/reply makes no sense, youre comment was about doubt James gunn can write and direct supero heroe movies, he has and has done so successfully
[2022-12-16 07:22:24] <mahoraz> no equivalent as they have no predecessor to compare to
[2022-12-16 07:22:41] <mahoraz> superman? tons of stuff to compare to
[2022-12-16 07:23:15] <mahoraz> he is essentially writing a new smallville
[2022-12-16 07:23:17] <%+prfella> how does that matter? and they absolutely do have predecessors, in the sense that they are super hero mioves, and suicide squad literally had an earlier movie
