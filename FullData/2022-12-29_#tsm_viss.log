[2022-12-29 18:01:30] <%AyOhDilon> Henry Cavill has been dropped as Superman by new DC executives James Gunn and Peter Safran. British actor Henry Cavill has been dropped from the role of Superman after new executives in charge of DC Studios decided they didn't want to cast him as the iconic superhero in their next movie.

[2022-12-29 20:39:04] <%kampossib1e> I liked Infinite Warfare: Zombies in Spaceland, but I'm a fan of the 80's.
[2022-12-29 20:39:13] <+GrittzNGravy> i still get a lot of good snipe kills but its not the 1 shot kill people want
[2022-12-29 20:39:21] <%+lord_volcom> being able to have multiple self revives is a large problem in this game

[2022-12-29 20:40:07] <%JtotheDizzle> XMR and a couple of the other snipers can one shot down people, but you have to aim upper chest/neck. Helmets are crazy OP.
[2022-12-29 20:40:10] <%Syberactive> Infinite Warfare had a fun campaign. I think I liked it so much because it was literally The Expanse in a game. Earth vs Mars lol

[2022-12-29 20:40:18] <+GrittzNGravy> i think snipes are usefull for 3rd party shots and for breaking armors of teams final circles to get an advantage
[2022-12-29 20:40:41] <+Rhody_Bob> Easter Reeses are the best. Best PB to chocolate ratio and perfectly soft.

[2022-12-29 21:53:27] <%$Riccochet704> I had a 20 minute layover in ATL and literally had to run full speed almost 2 miles to make my connecting flight
[2022-12-29 21:53:29] <chaotickatie1> LaGuardia way better than JFK lol
[2022-12-29 21:53:39] <%+BTINDY> ATL way busier than DEN

[2022-12-29 21:54:09] <%JtotheDizzle> @syberactive that‚Äôs probably true, I rarely fly into LGA. Always seems more expensive.
[2022-12-29 21:54:13] <%kampossib1e> Ya, Denver has been renovated nicely.
[2022-12-29 21:54:46] <%RiskOC> Hey @TSM_Viss , what are your thoughts on TSM not renewing with Break.

[2022-12-29 21:56:05] <%JtotheDizzle> I can‚Äôt imagine having to navigate JFK or Atlanta after international travel. It‚Äôs bad enough after a normal domestic travel day.
