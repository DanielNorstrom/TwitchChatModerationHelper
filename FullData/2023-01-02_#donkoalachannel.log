[2023-01-02 12:54:43] <@%Arabeusz_> just DM her worst that can happen is just no reply
[2023-01-02 12:55:02] <$xxTygar> just don't dm your ex. it's generally a recipe for disaster
[2023-01-02 12:55:05] <%Stella_lionheart> good good
[2023-01-02 12:55:22] <%Avari_Arts> @xxTygar I'm with tygar on this srsly

[2023-01-02 12:56:29] <%Stella_lionheart> then it'll probably be like you're trying not to keep contact

[2023-01-02 12:56:38] <%Avari_Arts> Gotta think about what you're even DMing for
[2023-01-02 12:56:40] <Blesk420TP> i feel like we touching on a sensitive topic. Perhaps we drop it and let Don decide for himself?
[2023-01-02 12:56:40] <$xxTygar> but did she break it off ?
[2023-01-02 12:56:40] <P0RTGASACE> if it fails, at least you tried, better than not trying and regret it later right? youre awesome Don, cuppyCheer cuppyCheer cuppyCheer
