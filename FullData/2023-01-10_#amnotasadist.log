[2023-01-10 00:10:03] VIEWERS: 163
[2023-01-10 00:10:28] <theskyismylimit> Qiqi is lucky for me, when I lose 50/50 with her I get my guarantee character in less 2 ten pulls
[2023-01-10 00:10:29] <%personomy> Also, anyone ever think about how there is no 5 star standard for Geo????
[2023-01-10 00:10:42] <Darkcaster101_> BUT I GET TO CHOOSE THE DOMAIN for the artifacts because some of these builds bring me pain
[2023-01-10 00:10:43] <maggie__mae> I just wanted c6 Benny but Yoimiya decided to come instead milkim1Cry
[2023-01-10 00:10:45] <the_darknight00> yes
[2023-01-10 00:11:16] <%personomy> Like every element has a 5 star standard, even Dendro which is new, but no Geo 5 star
[2023-01-10 00:11:17] <storm1212strike> More resin will make me play it more
[2023-01-10 00:11:32] <the_darknight00> yeah i got ayato as my first character and i won my first 50-50 now i am planning to get yelan

[2023-01-10 00:12:55] <wholesomeshrimp138> maybe a hot take but i think genshin doesnt have endgame like we have new char, new quests and regions and we go to the same cycle

[2023-01-10 00:15:42] <theskyismylimit> I have Tighnari materials when ever I get him, too bad I don’t have 50/50 since I’m guaranteed rn
[2023-01-10 00:15:46] <%personomy> I wish they would increase the Resin like 100 since they have so much more content
[2023-01-10 00:15:49] <%samsellsjams> he is super fun to play YEP YEP
[2023-01-10 00:15:54] <maggie__mae> I do have c6 Benny lmao
[2023-01-10 00:15:57] <freshofftheshelf> I want his weapon to come back so I can get it
[2023-01-10 00:16:05] <%personomy> Resin should gave gone up with Adventure Rank in my opinion

[2023-01-10 00:16:10] <carlaj432> He’s attacks pretty fast i like him and yae combined
[2023-01-10 00:16:14] <Darkcaster101_> Can I get the code for the community account Im logging in on mobile
[2023-01-10 00:16:15] <Tenor4Life95> C6 Benny is not bad tho
[2023-01-10 00:16:28] <freshofftheshelf> yeah! it's the one thing I didn't get when his banner was out
[2023-01-10 00:16:31] <akitamu_> One day we will have 3 limited banners on phase 1 and 3 on phase 2, the evil mihoyo is coming
[2023-01-10 00:16:54] <Tenor4Life95> C6 is good for the reactions but not good for canceling other characters own infusions
[2023-01-10 00:17:00] <storm1212strike> You have C6 because the red dot screamed at you
[2023-01-10 00:17:03] <mari_1898> I couldn’t not C6 him bc the red notice bothered me so much
[2023-01-10 00:17:06] <the_darknight00> weapon banner is a bamboozling scheme
[2023-01-10 00:17:11] <Tenor4Life95> or reducing some Physical DPS potential
[2023-01-10 00:17:14] <carlaj432> Physical is dead anyway c6 is cool

[2023-01-10 21:51:17] <yuriokyizu_> I’m banned from the kitchen
[2023-01-10 21:51:18] <roopretzelcham> OOOH, it's nice
[2023-01-10 21:51:20] <arweniyustheoverlord> When is it my turn to get an ER sands for Emblem for Xingqiu?
[2023-01-10 21:51:21] <%its_viviane> no never tried it, sounds good tho
[2023-01-10 21:51:32] <roopretzelcham> anyth made from potatoes is always delicious
[2023-01-10 21:51:35] <%+afternooncellica> Can we do a genshin cooking stream someday? POGGERS
[2023-01-10 21:51:35] <ReexIKenny> i love hoyo for the streamer rewards reexikFallen
[2023-01-10 21:51:36] <greenpotatothatdraws> I’m not allowed near da stove
[2023-01-10 21:51:42] <boredom_906> Do I get Al haitham or Ayato..
[2023-01-10 21:51:47] VIEWERS: 117
[2023-01-10 21:51:49] <StehtsZuMiefen> I love cooking so ...uhh please could go wrong in so many ways .....if u do one thing wrong then uff
[2023-01-10 21:51:50] <%admin_yee> i made hasselback potatoes, those were pretty good, every bit had cronch, not just the top layer
[2023-01-10 21:51:53] <jeonlunajung> sounds yuummm
[2023-01-10 21:51:58] <arweniyustheoverlord> I’m not kidding I have 8 DEF% sands for Emblem
[2023-01-10 21:51:59] <%+Jayliienn> If I’m dressed emo but watching a vtuber playing Genshin what do you think people’s first opinion will be
[2023-01-10 21:52:03] <ReexIKenny> yea the email i sent it to u in dc dm
[2023-01-10 21:52:09] <StehtsZuMiefen> It sounds good but it’s dangerous if ur not an „expert“
[2023-01-10 21:52:09] <%personomy> I have started farming for Yelan already as I can't farm for Al Haithaim
[2023-01-10 21:52:30] <ljuta_enchilada> i'm more into baking than cooking since covid
[2023-01-10 21:52:41] <yuriokyizu_> Im banned from the kitchen😭💀 I once burnt the pan I was using after that no more yurio in the kitchen
[2023-01-10 21:52:42] <%MigueC21> average genshin player
[2023-01-10 21:52:50] <%admin_yee> hasselback, the potatoes slices are perpendicular to the bottom of the dish, instead of parallel
[2023-01-10 21:52:52] <%personomy> it's easier to farm for character I don't have yet vs the ones I already have. idk whym
[2023-01-10 21:52:57] <arweniyustheoverlord> I mean Alhaitham is probably gonna use Deepwood Memories for the Dendro shred unless they introduce a new Artifact set for him, which I highly doubt
[2023-01-10 21:53:05] <greenpotatothatdraws> Depends the ppl your surrounded by
[2023-01-10 21:53:07] <ReexIKenny> the reason we dont receive streaming rewards is cause they can "run out of stock" basically
[2023-01-10 21:53:10] <%its_viviane> @yuriokyizu_ oh my
[2023-01-10 21:53:13] <%+Jayliienn> I burnt the cutting board

[2023-01-10 21:54:25] <arweniyustheoverlord> @personomy that’s true. I’m wishing for Xiao when he comes along because Alhaitham doesn’t look that fun OR brain dead to play. Xiao is one of the most brain dead characters to play you just jump and click
[2023-01-10 21:54:25] <%+Jayliienn> It was pushed onto the stove and it was plastic

[2023-01-10 22:48:18] <%MigueC21> ngl the main reason i skip raiden everytime is because she makes everything too easy notasadistS
[2023-01-10 22:48:21] <kryptid> i feel like whaling depends from person to person. like if someone plays genshin coming from a diff gacha then theyd probably whale when they first start. as for me who has never played a gacha before the most i spent was like $50 on kokomi
[2023-01-10 22:48:22] <kazuha_is_best_boi> Yae Miko robbed me and still didn’t come home BibleThump

[2023-01-10 23:39:15] <%+Jayliienn> Gonna just chat on my phone it’s easier, double device watching stream is true dedication
[2023-01-10 23:39:18] <%DreamingofHorror> but it can't exceed 8% of the character's max hp
[2023-01-10 23:39:24] <severewhale> im tempted to pull
[2023-01-10 23:39:25] <%Noejhl> so he would heal more the less def your charakter has?
[2023-01-10 23:39:34] <%MigueC21> actually don't know what keqing cons do
[2023-01-10 23:39:34] <RomeArtifact> i only got ayato because i got his signature weapon trying to pull raidens weapon
[2023-01-10 23:39:34] <%personomy> Ayaka is OP, I don't like her as a character, but her damage with minimal effort is stupid
[2023-01-10 23:39:41] <%+Jayliienn> 3rd device is for playing Genshin

[2023-01-10 23:39:43] <kryptid> yeah cause ayaka c2 (?) gives her a bigger aoe on her bursst right? and her c1 reduces her E skill cd
