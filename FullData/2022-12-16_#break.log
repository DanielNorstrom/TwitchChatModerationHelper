[2022-12-16 12:39:33] <stylage> twitch is on meth
[2022-12-16 12:39:34] <%ZCrimes> oh i saw this on Lobos strum, yeah, you can also watch trailers for money break. do it LUL
[2022-12-16 12:39:45] <@%$Breakspear> 190 hours is 9 hours a day.
[2022-12-16 12:39:47] <Rixstarian> & you can't miss an hour of ads, or they fuck you.
[2022-12-16 12:39:49] <%Line_Noise> They forgot you're not Amazon warehouse workers
[2022-12-16 12:39:50] <%MrMofo> Do it for a month, xmas sorted Kappa
[2022-12-16 12:39:56] <%SingularFish> INCENTIVIZE THIS
[2022-12-16 12:39:57] [Notification] Frank_Quitely subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! [Merry Christmas to you and the family Mr Break. Hope you overindulge in what makes you happy.]
[2022-12-16 12:40:03] <%Invisiblemag> time to go to Kick Kapp
[2022-12-16 12:40:04] <%+dash_dingo_> do you get an unpaid lunch hour with that
[2022-12-16 12:40:06] <@%$Breakspear> Pretty much aye
[2022-12-16 12:40:08] <CandiedMango> they estimate it based on previous months and stuff, so I had a friend who did a subathon for the entire month and his incentive was for 264 hours because of that :)
[2022-12-16 12:40:10] <%SingularFish> Is Tez banned modCheck
[2022-12-16 12:40:13] <%Jacobian1979> so if he streams 3/4's of that.... he gets 3/4's of the money
[2022-12-16 12:40:14] <Dynci> no one wants to watch 9 mins of ads
[2022-12-16 12:40:21] <%ZCrimes> watch Cocaine Bear and get money
[2022-12-16 12:40:22] <Rixstarian> @Jacobian1979 No LUL
[2022-12-16 12:40:25] <%tez______> AngryArthur
[2022-12-16 12:40:28] <%Line_Noise> No one will watch a channel that runs 9 minutes of ads an hour

[2022-12-16 12:40:30] <Trucido_> even a youtube ad on my phone makes me want to close the app
[2022-12-16 12:40:41] <%Jacobian1979> @Rixstarian yes
[2022-12-16 12:40:41] <%Clarkefruit> I think in media, I'll find it again
[2022-12-16 12:40:41] <@%sRede> afaik it's based on previous month, and if you're offered 1-2-3 mins, and you pick 3, next month is 2-3-4
[2022-12-16 12:40:43] <%ZCrimes> @Line_Noise yup
[2022-12-16 12:40:45] <%DanS0L0> next year i can see twitch doing big promo work for twitch turbo. Need to ruin the experience first though so people get it
[2022-12-16 12:40:50] <@%$Breakspear> ZCrimes I suggested it to the Mrs, and she looked at me blankly
[2022-12-16 12:40:51] <+yuebrian222> You know how break has that intro video? Can you just have a 9 minute intro video and put all the ads there?
[2022-12-16 12:40:57] <Dynci> ye i agree
[2022-12-16 12:40:58] <Trucido_> why cant there be an ad on the side of the stream rather than block the content itself
[2022-12-16 12:41:06] <%lefthandu> More 'chatting' = less Deadge
[2022-12-16 12:41:06] <%tez______> I think the content could be better
[2022-12-16 12:41:07] <%wbbigdave> Is Elon deciding the Ad incentives?
[2022-12-16 12:41:14] <%wbbigdave> Feels like the sort of stupid decision he makes
[2022-12-16 12:41:18] <%Line_Noise> I don't watch anything I'm not subbed to any more, it's just infuriating to try
[2022-12-16 12:41:20] <%ZCrimes> @Breakspear actually should, its kinda interesting to say the least Keepo

[2022-12-16 12:41:32] <Dynci> so do you think twitch is going abit down hill atm ?
[2022-12-16 12:41:35] <@%$Breakspear> If you're smart with the Ads, it doesn't matter as much. If you're playing PUBG, you could do an ad break between each game
[2022-12-16 12:41:39] <Trucido_> just have a 512x512 pixel window on the corner of your stream running adds KEKW
[2022-12-16 12:41:39] <+yuebrian222> i insta mute the ads

[2022-12-16 12:41:45] <%LiamG> your content would be better if you manned up and jumped in the ice bath imo
[2022-12-16 12:41:48] <%tominyorks> You could replace the 9 minutes of talking about ghost poos every hour with ads 5Head

[2022-12-16 12:42:08] <@%$Breakspear> Do banner ads count too?
[2022-12-16 12:42:14] <%Clarkefruit> OMEGALUL look at general now, I replied to it

[2022-12-16 12:44:06] <%Line_Noise> Twitch are just going to burn the platform for ad rev at this point
[2022-12-16 12:44:08] <+DeadMeat_87> would you stream on YT as well?

[2022-12-16 12:44:23] <CandiedMango> 60 minutes of ads
[2022-12-16 12:44:24] <@%sRede> Breakspear no
[2022-12-16 12:44:27] <+Denkimon> what about 60 minutes of ads per hour ? BreakBoogie
[2022-12-16 12:44:29] <%MrMofo> 1hour of ads Kappa
[2022-12-16 12:44:41] <%tez______> Does it state the ads have to be full screen?
[2022-12-16 12:44:43] <%tominyorks> More like a ghost handjob Breakspear
[2022-12-16 12:44:44] <Rixstarian> Twitch will keep towing the line because no one's holding a fire under them.
[2022-12-16 12:44:50] <@%$Breakspear> Thats a shame sRede . I see banner ads regularly, and they're great
[2022-12-16 12:44:55] <%ZCrimes> yeah, getting rid of viewers, good college fund

[2022-12-16 12:45:34] <%+stokiebob> They need to understand at some point that even their best content creators are not worth sitting through an extended period of ads. Killing their own product.
[2022-12-16 12:45:35] <%ZCrimes> this is tommy teleshopping now, not twitch LUL
[2022-12-16 12:45:56] <%Tsubalthak> Onepeg is a YT grinder. he is all about that bag so his community knows what they are getting.
[2022-12-16 12:45:59] <Trucido_> sucks that streaming services have turned into like tv cable
[2022-12-16 12:46:16] <@%sRede> so don't play ads, it's an option Shruge

[2022-12-16 12:47:07] <+JackLDN27> Whats a pre-roll?
[2022-12-16 12:47:12] <%Line_Noise> Pre-rolls would have to be worse because you'll just bounce viewers

[2022-12-16 12:47:20] <%Line_Noise> Pre-rolls are the ads that play on stream load JackLDN27

[2022-12-16 12:49:56] <Rixstarian> Twitch claims it's still making a loss even after Amazon, but I think it's just mismanaging revenue.

[2022-12-16 12:50:01] <%HipHobbesT> Wel, they have to make back the money they wasted on Rings of Power somehow.
[2022-12-16 12:50:03] <%bigolslabomeat> All they need to do to save pre-rolls is delay them by (e.g) 10 minutes. By that time you've decided if you're going to stick around

[2022-12-16 12:50:41] <%paddy988> twitch are definitely pushing ads, but if they keep doing 6-8 unskippable ads at once it will only ever piss people off. Even youtube is only 1-2 at a time and they are skippable

[2022-12-16 13:28:44] <%ZCrimes> @Breakspear you know the blue gypsum kilns in higher lvl towns? they increase your expertise slowly, as will looting elite chests
[2022-12-16 13:28:55] <%ZCrimes> the best
[2022-12-16 13:29:04] <Bjorne> yaya boss fights can be very intense

[2022-12-16 13:29:08] <%SlimmrockTV> @Breakspear I think that means you can run 500 gear, anything higher than than will scale back to 500 but increase as you lvl up
[2022-12-16 13:29:10] <%ZCrimes> so calming
[2022-12-16 13:29:13] <%+dash_dingo_> the boss fight themes are great
