[2022-12-25 04:06:41] <+covote13> No character swap in battle seems like an interesting challenge. But switching is one of my favorite things about FFX.
[2022-12-25 04:07:05] <+covote13> Any other good turn based rpgs that allow in battle character switching?
[2022-12-25 04:07:27] VIEWERS: 184
[2022-12-25 04:08:15] <+UltraOtaku> There are quite a few I'm sure, but the first one that comes to mind for me in Xenosaga Episode III.
[2022-12-25 04:09:00] <+covote13> hmm, would I need to play Xenosaga I and II? never looked into those
[2022-12-25 04:09:02] <%+hoodedornament> Breath of Fire 1 I think?
[2022-12-25 04:09:21] <%+hoodedornament> Or maybe just menu... hm.
[2022-12-25 04:09:27] VIEWERS: 184
[2022-12-25 04:10:38] <+UltraOtaku> @covote13 Yeah I'd recommend playing Xenosaga I & II first. But it's worth it to get to Xenosaga III. One of the very best PS2 JRPG's (next to FFX).

[2022-12-25 04:18:25] <+covote13> uhoh, finding a way to play xenosaga might be troublesome.
[2022-12-25 04:18:43] <+UltraOtaku> Yeah, I'm the same way. I want to start the Trails games because I hear they are so good. But there are just so many that I never take that first step.
[2022-12-25 04:19:27] VIEWERS: 182
[2022-12-25 04:20:52] <+covote13> I bought the first few on Steam, they are on the Winter Sale, might never touch them, but first one is installed. been finishing up Persona 4 for the first time
