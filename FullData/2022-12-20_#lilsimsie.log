[2022-12-20 22:31:22] <%+pmr32606> when will you unlock stitch?
[2022-12-20 22:31:25] <%$peaceloveAlex> I accidentally gave a festive fish to Ariel yesterday üò≠
[2022-12-20 22:31:26] <ebtsmoked> wait how did you unlock the bottom row for kristoff?
[2022-12-20 22:31:26] <@%^Moobot> this may come as a shock to you, but lilsimsie also makes YouTube videos?? subscribe. now. https://www.youtube.com/lilsimsie simsieCool
[2022-12-20 22:31:34] <%madisyn59> the festive fish have red and green bubbles
[2022-12-20 22:31:39] <%$holy_marisa> I caught two of the festive fish
[2022-12-20 22:31:41] <m11eena> are you liking the logitech headset? i've been debating on getting them
[2022-12-20 22:31:45] <%$holy_marisa> simsieHype
[2022-12-20 22:31:46] <rammmmie> hey besties

[2022-12-20 22:31:50] <%+stephspotato> hey guys! what was in the advent calendar?
[2022-12-20 22:31:56] <@%goosekingdom> i have successfully obtained a carrot cake
[2022-12-20 22:32:01] <%+lena_817> Did you catch the festive fish on the beach? He doesn‚Äôt show up for me..
[2022-12-20 22:32:01] <@%+ceesees> NICE
[2022-12-20 22:32:04] <jennrrose3> i thought the festive fish only spawned on the 18th?
[2022-12-20 22:32:13] <%$SailorScout04> I love carrot cake!!
[2022-12-20 22:32:18] <%oanayu> no, it's kristoff's level 10 quest that upgrades his stall
[2022-12-20 22:32:19] <%$desert_koala94> @lena_817 it needs to be raining
[2022-12-20 22:32:19] <%justRayxox> i usually play on switch but sometimes i play on mac but for some reason when  i save to the cloud and try to pick up on the computer, it doesnt show me having stitch and i lose a lot of progress so i cant play on my computer
[2022-12-20 22:32:21] <@%goosekingdom> its not the right 'shape' but im hoping it tastes the same
[2022-12-20 22:32:23] <%$peaceloveAlex> I‚Äôve caught 3 of the festive fish so far
[2022-12-20 22:32:23] <abifullofgrace> is this game exclusive to the switch?
[2022-12-20 22:32:24] <%alicexaw> when you give the gifts, the naughty gift (coal) doesnt add to the hohoho quest thing simsieCry
[2022-12-20 22:32:24] <%$mischaquiet> proud of you, hope simsieLove
[2022-12-20 22:32:26] <@%+ceesees> it was starting the 18th

[2022-12-20 22:32:33] <akhigh10> starting on the 18
[2022-12-20 22:32:35] <%+julspy> no, they are still spawning, but you can only get them once
[2022-12-20 22:32:35] <%+ThatgirlChristine> i got a festive fish yesterday

[2022-12-20 22:33:25] <%$mischaquiet> @pcombs11811 you need to give them to different characters, i also though it wasn‚Äôt counting
[2022-12-20 22:33:25] <%ShammahBrownie> simsieHype simsieHype
[2022-12-20 22:33:26] <%$peaceloveAlex> The lil Santa hat lolo
[2022-12-20 22:33:28] <%lizzylion572> It has a tiny hat lol
[2022-12-20 22:33:29] <%$alaurel17> is there something special about the fish other than just there looks? i autofilled a recipe and didnt realize it used the one i had caught so far until after i had pressed it lol
[2022-12-20 22:33:38] <$ICevoL> It's just that you can only catch one of each. Once you've caught one, they won't spawn again
[2022-12-20 22:33:40] <%+XtraCheezPlz_> Kayla I don't know if you care to keep them for the novelty, but be careful when auto cooking because it will add them to it!
[2022-12-20 22:33:40] <%$desert_koala94> you cant sell them
[2022-12-20 22:33:46] <%letsclarindo> @letsclarindo i think she would like it
[2022-12-20 22:33:50] <Bookfan08> ok i can not find the second sock anywhere!
[2022-12-20 22:33:53] <%+artistsinlove> i accidentally cooked my festive fish :(
[2022-12-20 22:33:55] <akhigh10> @pcombs11811 festive angler only spawns from 6pm-8am
[2022-12-20 22:33:55] <%+sage_fine> I put mine on a table because it will auto-use them cooking if you aren't careful.
[2022-12-20 22:33:59] <%42hitch42> do we know when the festive fish end?
[2022-12-20 22:34:02] <$Inkwellsp> I giggled like a loon when I caught my first festive fish
[2022-12-20 22:34:07] <%oanayu> you can't sell them but you can cook them, so be careful with auto filling
[2022-12-20 22:34:15] <%$desert_koala94> @Bookfan08 the second sock is in the meadow mine was over by Merlins house
[2022-12-20 22:34:21] <%alicexaw> @Bookfan08 second sock is in the peaceful meadow and the third sock is in the forest of valor
[2022-12-20 22:34:26] <$pcombs11811> @mischaquiet I did give it to Ursula and never gave her any other gifts and it unfortunately didn't count.
[2022-12-20 22:34:30] <%$peaceloveAlex> Yeah and can also accidentally give to characters

[2022-12-20 22:46:16] <%+cyclingcyborg> theres no competive aspect to the game so its really strong to call that cheating. and people cant always be around when events happen because life still happens irl

[2022-12-20 22:47:19] <%$desert_koala94> Yeah its basically like once you go forward you can't go back. So however long you go forward you have to wait till then real time to have anything respawn

[2022-12-20 22:51:01] <%+digitalblush> hey simsie, i know youre not playing sims today so im sorry if im not supposed to talk about it, but me & a few ppl in ur discord are saying that ur newest apartment (the one u uploaded yesterday) is undownloadable. possibly due to the missing chunk of the apartment and it not being the full apartment? idk. i figured id just let u know simsieLove
[2022-12-20 22:51:04] <akrehz> Do you always record so far in advance?
[2022-12-20 22:51:05] <helloyou2222> did you get you golden potato??
[2022-12-20 22:51:08] <lilypad_rose09> we only put our tree up today
[2022-12-20 22:51:11] <%Dawnie3296> Our tree stays up until mid-January until after Orthodox Christmas/Epiphany so it wouldn't be too dated.
[2022-12-20 22:51:18] <furryperson01> how you doin
[2022-12-20 22:51:25] <walkthemoo> Are you playing on pc?
[2022-12-20 22:51:30] <%+digitalblush> yes it is, i was the one who mentioned it simsieCry simsieCry
[2022-12-20 22:51:37] <furryperson01> ok

[2022-12-20 22:51:42] <%+XtraCheezPlz_> @XtraCheezPlz_ If you fast travel to Ratatouille realm from the map by pressing M then T you can make and eat souffle for free. It takes 2 to fill your energy meter with gold and then you can drop extra on the ground and leave the realm right back to where you fast travelled from.
[2022-12-20 22:51:46] <%42hitch42> I had a garland last year that I left up until this year when I needed to fix the lights that died. Now I still haven't fixed it. Oops.
[2022-12-20 22:51:47] <%Dawnie3296> It cuts off the kitchen.
[2022-12-20 22:51:52] <+capncharlie_> Sorry if someone asked already but did we do the advent calendar openings already? simsieEyes gotta tell my nephew what we got every day, lol
[2022-12-20 22:51:56] <$misszer00> yeah it literally wont place
[2022-12-20 22:51:56] <%Dawnie3296> That whole side.
[2022-12-20 22:52:05] <enchantressgamer> Hi
[2022-12-20 22:52:10] <%oanayu> it could be because of the platforms?
[2022-12-20 22:52:14] <%Missygirl93> It's on the wrong lot maybe
[2022-12-20 22:52:15] <%+digitalblush> nono ur ok!! i think its maybe because of the missing chunk of it. no need to worry it about now, im just letting u know!! u just cant place half of it.
[2022-12-20 22:52:17] <%$holy_marisa> @capncharlie_ We got mustard and a bunny!

[2022-12-20 22:53:45] <%oanayu> I've had issues with placing apartments sometimes even without having platforms in the game at all, sometimes apartments are simply buggy and annoying

[2022-12-20 23:14:40] <sadiesd> It stitch only available for so long ? I heard you said something about quests
[2022-12-20 23:14:55] <%+mollyoco> sometimes i have to save for it to show the time ive spent with them
[2022-12-20 23:14:58] <%$Skye00128> It‚Äôs 5 days now until you get stitch
[2022-12-20 23:15:00] <leifeste> I think the timer for the star path takes a minute or two for it to update!
[2022-12-20 23:15:01] <%alicexaw> sometimes if you go on a differentnt tab it updates the time
[2022-12-20 23:15:01] <+xemily330> Awh heck, ads
[2022-12-20 23:15:03] <$ICevoL> It doesn't constantly update the times for hangouts. Noticed that when I was on those tasks. I think it may update when the autosaves happen

[2022-12-20 23:15:08] <%oanayu> i have to give elsa her favorite gifts and to take a picture of the ice cavern, after that I'll be fully done with the starpath
[2022-12-20 23:15:15] <sofiehvedelll> I love the idea of animal crossing but i just don't have patience enough to make my island cute
[2022-12-20 23:15:18] <%+ThatRogueVessa> It takes 10 real days to get him

[2022-12-20 23:16:25] <%+ashleyg02> @lilolivetrees you should be able to since it‚Äôs linked to your steam account
[2022-12-20 23:16:31] <alexapotts> That reminded me when someone ask Harry styles how long it took him to get  his hair to length for a bun. But he though they asked how long it take for him to make the bun and he said about 5seconds
[2022-12-20 23:16:34] <TheGracefulLion> I wish the tasks were a bit harder honestly but I get that this is for kids
[2022-12-20 23:16:40] <loli2222222222> How expensive is the game?
[2022-12-20 23:16:46] <%+sage_fine> I like the slow pace of animal crossing and this game personally.  I'm in no rush.

[2022-12-20 23:23:53] <@%goosekingdom> i think they do a great job of telling you what it takes to unlock new quests, its frustrating for me when i dont know what i need to do to get a new one

[2022-12-20 23:23:59] <WolfyFiesta> if it takes me more than 10 minutes to find an item in a quest I get stressed out and have to move on lol
[2022-12-20 23:24:05] <%plantsy> it's like when you play stardew for the first time and the game is like why haven't you met everyone, harvested a full yield of crops, and built a coop by day 2

[2022-12-20 23:44:37] <@%ItIsDanya> I dont remember much

[2022-12-20 23:44:41] <%+EllieEverlasting> @Lexie1022 Sorry, I liked Universal so much better. I remember a roller coaster and that is about it.
[2022-12-20 23:44:41] <nicoleniet> cars land is soooo fun
[2022-12-20 23:44:41] <%magix532> ive never been but avengers campus looks really cool!
[2022-12-20 23:44:47] <%+digitalblush> ive only been to disney world so idk
[2022-12-20 23:44:48] <foolishpickle> I went to Disneyland like once when I was 5

[2022-12-20 23:44:59] <%$pxnkspace> Averagers Camp was disappointing IMO
[2022-12-20 23:44:59] <+bookworm95687> If you‚Äôre going to California Adventure I like soarin over California. It‚Äôs more relaxing than a lot of rides
[2022-12-20 23:45:01] <@%goosekingdom> madison was saying we should go to nintendo land for her spring break and then maybe disneyland hehe
[2022-12-20 23:45:02] <princessstealyourgiirl> I've only been to Disneyland Paris

[2022-12-20 23:45:21] <+enbymudkip> The ferries wheel in california adventure is so pretty during sunset time
[2022-12-20 23:45:24] <%Dawnie3296> It is disappointing.
[2022-12-20 23:45:27] <@%ItIsDanya> I do remember there was some kind of ride where you sit and they played some kind of movie but it was like 4d or something and you would get sprayed on by water
[2022-12-20 23:45:28] <@%goosekingdom> maybe it can be an event, ill look into it
[2022-12-20 23:45:29] <%$SailorScout04> There‚Äôs a Nintendo Land!?
[2022-12-20 23:45:34] <%kiriokatoji> I live near Disney land but I never went
[2022-12-20 23:45:36] <$passionfairy55> I love Indiana Jones and Space Mountain at the main park...and everything at California Adventure.

[2022-12-20 23:46:07] <%+ladycelestius> Space Mountain at Disneyland is newer than the one at World and is a better, smoother ride.
[2022-12-20 23:46:09] <%Dawnie3296> The communications array is the bathroom!
