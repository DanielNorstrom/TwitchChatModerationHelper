[2023-01-07 15:34:57] <+Bartz1um> @newengines All tanks have their pro's and con's. Warriors are regarded "the best" due to them having alot of defensive cd's to burn often and they are stronger in their con's then some others. It's all in the eyes of the beholder. warriors are easier to play and perform on too.

[2023-01-07 18:04:26] <+spookylock> @kozoiy I think, part of that is the opportunity loss. Most high key groups play together and play a lot. In lower keys that might be your only key for the day. Easier to be chill when a mistake wastes 40 minutes and you're immediately back in another high key.
[2023-01-07 18:04:38] <%ATouchOfJaffa> I see bears complaining abotu survival quite a lot and the are a lower "tier" on subcreation. O bears not need attention atm as well?
