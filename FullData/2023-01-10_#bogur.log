[2023-01-10 13:26:01] VIEWERS: 142
[2023-01-10 13:26:05] <@%+Zenxis> Then just to be sure you have it selected you can do "list disk" again and it should have an asterisk ( * ) next to the drive you selected
[2023-01-10 13:26:31] <@%+Zenxis> Once that's done, type in "clean"

[2023-01-10 15:57:45] <@^Nightbot> Of course bogur has a circular window! You might think it is a bad architectural design a circular window seperating the bedroom from the kitchen but it actually serves a great purpose. It allows the person on the bed to view the people in the kitchen without all the smells and sounds coming through. The circular window motives bogur to get up, be happy, and play winston Monke

[2023-01-10 16:45:08] <%lindskitten> watching your stream has been super enlightening about contenders and going pro, I have to say
[2023-01-10 16:45:25] <%FPSKappa> you said something about a ring light and i was offering to show you a great cheap alternative
[2023-01-10 16:45:39] <Xelorz_> I think some of the top players in OWL get like 100k but that's the high end
[2023-01-10 16:45:45] <!%penkuinek> no way
[2023-01-10 16:45:49] <!%penkuinek> the ring light meme becomes real

[2023-01-10 17:02:11] <%hilmdustin> You get the same amount of adaptive shields as the first time you pressed it again regardless if you’re near enemies, all you have to do is just press and and hold e while playing one of the most movement intensive heroes
[2023-01-10 17:02:32] <%mixery_ow> They should rework mercy and change her rez and dmg boost
[2023-01-10 17:02:38] <!%penkuinek> bass slut is ab anger
