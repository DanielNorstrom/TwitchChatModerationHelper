[2022-12-17 06:37:44] <Chronobot> We all lift GIGACHAD
[2022-12-17 06:37:46] <Fizzycurl> Warframe truly benefits from having an experienced player to guide you.
[2022-12-17 06:37:49] <coma_dose> I forgot about the high rank player adopting new players
[2022-12-17 06:37:56] <@%Raspy_Cobra> Time for silver to teach the mods how to Warframe rosedoNODDERS
[2022-12-17 06:37:56] <%$reecenuada> So Warframe is like how PSO2 og is it helps to have a friend to teach you the ways

[2022-12-17 06:57:21] <Scheifen> laynaStare we gotta get you a railjack so you can try it out its seriously some of the most fun ever with a team

[2022-12-17 06:57:26] <+zitcream> railjack has the added bonus of the coolest cephalon in the game
[2022-12-17 06:57:29] <+Sapphiery> @Zephini ehhh yareli is pretty solid at this point, she was iffy when she came out I guess but she's been buffed and reworked to the point she's very viable. There are plenty of frames that are way worse than her
[2022-12-17 06:57:29] <4_xk> Takes like 3 days of waiting for the railjack quest

[2022-12-17 06:57:36] <%Mercilesssn4> nagCool could knock out the railjack quest
[2022-12-17 06:58:00] <kumanchik> @4_xk I didn't think so
[2022-12-17 06:58:00] <%+Snyd1> @Snyd1 that is some commitment there i think the closest i come to anything like that is fallout 4 with a little over 2000 hours

[2022-12-17 07:07:45] <Zephini> @Sapphiery Okay, I can agree with Oberon. Frost, ppl still use him for Defenses and he can do true damage on impact and he can armor strip. Trinity has Energy Vampire and she can heal her self and the team, One of the best endurance frames in the game. Loki's 1 and 3 is useless unless SPY missions, but his Ult is a very very good CC for endurance runs and one of the best if I had to say.....

[2022-12-17 07:09:50] <Zephini> @Sapphiery And for Yareli, she has her passive which gives 200% but u have to stand, while Zephyr has 150% just from being in the air. Yareli has a K-Drive which is very bad to move around in the maps of Warframe. And the fact that the spinning blades of hers doesn't scale with range is very bad as well. Her ult is a weaker ult compared to Zephyr's

[2022-12-17 07:12:39] <LoFiGondola> This game sure has evolved from the sprinting around shooting a million identical grineer while doing front flips as a Mag that I remember  Brrr

[2022-12-17 08:57:41] <Vanawhit> it is really cool honestly, and just do what you feel like

[2022-12-17 08:57:44] <%IvoryTemplar> I used to love running Eidolons.
[2022-12-17 08:57:44] <%+Kuro_Cobra> Just finished a gruelling day at work. Glad I can come home and watch some Silvervale to decompress SilverPetalCozy
[2022-12-17 08:57:44] <Clemency_> Warframe is generally not a toxic community, but eidolon hunting is the toxic part.
[2022-12-17 08:57:44] <+Endertau> You did really good for first time, i usually just fish all day out there
[2022-12-17 08:57:45] <kumanchik> Don't let the toxic people stop you silver

[2022-12-17 08:57:52] <The_Freedom_Fries> Time to go to Deimos

[2022-12-17 08:58:28] <Vanawhit> @CyberAgeGenesis i think the bounty was to specifically capture it
[2022-12-17 08:58:28] <%+Aekrid> TBF doing Eidolon hunts can be pretty toxic cause of people expecting you to do it perfectly/ watched a video on it/ kill in a few seconds

[2022-12-17 09:00:00] <%+fwyrl> @CyberAgeGenesis They failed the bounty because they finished (with 2 lures) about 30 seconds too late, which is good time for a first-time eidolon hunt. Also, iirc, the bounty only gives standing, and the real rewards drop from the lures, so she got all the drops

[2022-12-17 09:27:24] <Clemency_> Warframe is 100% FTP and you can get the in-game currency free through trading. Paying makes the grind faster, but it's definitely not pay to win.

[2022-12-17 10:24:54] <$Artic_Omen> Wait since warfare is cross platform can I add anyone?
[2022-12-17 10:24:55] <!%PsychoStingerXD> You'll Need Bait for the Rare Ones
[2022-12-17 10:24:56] <AmusedBenga1> @ChernoBeta I hate when people do that
[2022-12-17 10:24:56] <eugdigo> honestly I just never thought Silver actually played warframe before
[2022-12-17 10:24:56] <denimjacketboi> the rare deimos fish have very specific catching conditions
[2022-12-17 10:24:57] <+Psychatix> the rare ones IIRC, are in the caves, where they are harder to find
[2022-12-17 10:25:00] <GotESDrew> Some Fish are Night and Day locked. And Wiki helps.
[2022-12-17 10:25:00] <+RedLinesBurn> rare fish only appear with bait
[2022-12-17 10:25:00] <Mudpebble> PeepoShy i was going to ask numerous times if i could help you focus farm but i'm shy
[2022-12-17 10:25:02] <$Artic_Omen> warframe*
[2022-12-17 10:25:03] <shotgunenjoyer> Fortuna fishes have wackier names imo
[2022-12-17 10:25:05] <Aieis> fish dodging all the hooks KEKW
[2022-12-17 10:25:09] <%+Aekrid> I always thought it'd bother you if I see you in-game since you're probably enjoying yourself or playing with Clan people
[2022-12-17 10:25:09] <senaagra> rare ones dont really show up without bet
[2022-12-17 10:25:13] <fuzzydt> if they have gold parts on them or in very dangerous places

[2022-12-17 10:25:27] <%sansnom22> dramatic music is large
[2022-12-17 10:25:28] <NeedMoreDakka> music depends on the caught fish size
[2022-12-17 10:25:29] <Aieis> @Artic_Omen no, its crossplay but u cant add any players from other platforms yet

[2022-12-17 10:35:18] <%+unityofone> sadly this is about the point where  warframe turned sour, you stop playing warframe and are forced to play concobs

[2022-12-17 10:55:55] <Judeo_> ALL HAIL THE CORN LORDS
[2022-12-17 10:55:57] <ishiblacksnake> Its literally coffin with legs
[2022-12-17 10:55:58] <knives_0318> died of comfyness
[2022-12-17 10:55:58] <ZenniStardust> I AM CORNHOLIO! I NEED TP FOR ME BUNGHOLE~
[2022-12-17 10:56:00] <Paragonisyay> NotLikeThis comfiness, leads to death
[2022-12-17 10:56:01] <KnightOfGear08> Aware
[2022-12-17 10:56:03] <Aieis> hold it to dash
[2022-12-17 10:56:05] <Cheshire_S_Dragon> Hold it
[2022-12-17 10:56:05] <%nerlyk> i love your imagination SilverLOL
[2022-12-17 10:56:09] <ForsakenOnes> SilverPetalLove
[2022-12-17 10:56:13] <SlayerV90> think Warhammer dreadnaught
[2022-12-17 10:56:15] <%+ANQAB_As_Music> there used to be glitch where just the corn looking part was visible
[2022-12-17 10:56:16] <shotgunenjoyer> that's what you died to back in the vaults
[2022-12-17 10:56:23] <ReMaestro> jump while slidiing
[2022-12-17 10:56:23] <Fizzycurl> They had a Warhammer dev during Deimos update. It.. shows a bit. But just a bit.
[2022-12-17 10:56:24] <dxantonxdme> that dashh is so cool
[2022-12-17 10:56:26] <RiffRaff1138> There's a fuel/stamina meter bottom center
[2022-12-17 10:56:26] <spenim_sap> santavale. noice
[2022-12-17 10:56:30] <erandior123> much better than the lore
[2022-12-17 10:56:31] <Aieis> the fuel gauge below is for dashing
[2022-12-17 10:56:32] <Lekais> You have a sprint meter at the bottom. Might want to reserve some juice when you need it
[2022-12-17 10:56:34] <CrocBox> armored core 6 looks different than I thought ironmouseKEK
[2022-12-17 10:56:41] <Dellickaine> I've always seen it as just a type of sarcophagus that's used to hold a "soul" so it can function
[2022-12-17 10:56:43] <GotESDrew> It is dependant on your gauge below

[2022-12-17 10:56:54] <Sakatchi> Cause of that dev we now have bolters and dreadnaughts in warframe lol
[2022-12-17 10:56:55] <Mudpebble> they're broken
[2022-12-17 10:56:56] <ZazorokXIV> nope
[2022-12-17 10:56:57] <Haepax> They are very strong yes
[2022-12-17 10:56:57] VIEWERS: 4 418
[2022-12-17 10:56:59] <%TheScarletskies> Iron man be lookin diff
[2022-12-17 10:56:59] <HungryGhostTree> voidrigs are VERY VERY GOOD
[2022-12-17 10:57:00] <Wychlight> Yes they're good
[2022-12-17 10:57:02] <+RahuHordika> You can only use them in open worlds
[2022-12-17 10:57:05] <Eddilon> You trade mobility for tank and damage
[2022-12-17 10:57:05] <Werewolfie101> They are very powerfull
[2022-12-17 10:57:05] <%Imperator_Starwing> Sometimes yea
[2022-12-17 10:57:06] <%jacob_quenepa> pepeBoobs
[2022-12-17 10:57:06] <Alpeus> can't use them everywhere
[2022-12-17 10:57:06] <Sakatchi> Also necromechs can level to 40 so sort of
[2022-12-17 10:57:07] <shotgunenjoyer> there's a gamemode where you almost exclusively use necramech
[2022-12-17 10:57:08] <namesaretricky> necramechs can have very high damage
[2022-12-17 10:57:09] <%+Psychatix> They're very strong
[2022-12-17 10:57:09] <%SnowyKrow> they are very strong
[2022-12-17 10:57:09] <XxElementZero> depends on the mission, but the voidrig is very broken
[2022-12-17 10:57:11] <ArchangelRD> can be good for eidelon
[2022-12-17 10:57:11] <+002Abdelion> They are good for eidolon
[2022-12-17 10:57:11] <HungryGhostTree> they're so good you're not allowed to use them in most missions
[2022-12-17 10:57:11] <Ir00nix> Necramech is amazing for killing Free Roam bosses.
[2022-12-17 10:57:12] <+Razputin217> Is this Anthem? Kappa
[2022-12-17 10:57:12] <Minielvan> their exalted weps are the strongest weapons in the game

[2022-12-17 10:57:13] <Trekka> I never use my mech LuL
[2022-12-17 10:57:13] <angryoptimist> If you build it well, it does a ridiculous amount of damage.
[2022-12-17 10:57:13] <Exio115> the 4 on the voidrig is the best gun in the game
[2022-12-17 10:57:13] <Temrio> necramechs are really strong but you cant use them everywhere
[2022-12-17 10:57:14] <Sakatchi> Farming them is a pain tho
[2022-12-17 10:57:18] <%+Aekrid> The areas you can use them are limited
[2022-12-17 10:57:18] <Ir00nix> Like Eidolons
[2022-12-17 10:57:18] <%+linksdx> there realllly tanky and dont count a life if they die
[2022-12-17 10:57:19] <SummonedSnake> NercaMechs are good on some missions and there are some that you cant use your frame in a few areas but can use the Necramech
[2022-12-17 10:57:20] <Mudpebble> no
[2022-12-17 10:57:21] <fuzzydt> they're not massively powerful but they do have any damage if you pick the right one
[2022-12-17 10:57:22] <+braizek13> they're fun.
[2022-12-17 10:57:23] <Paragonisyay> "cuter" no
[2022-12-17 10:57:25] <Haepax> They're strong, but you can't use them everywhere
[2022-12-17 10:57:29] <namesaretricky> but a lot less mobile
[2022-12-17 10:57:29] <%nerlyk> well they are giant mechs, i’d choose a mech over normal frames any day lol
[2022-12-17 10:57:29] <%+Psychatix> Think of it as a pokemon gigantamax
[2022-12-17 10:57:31] <Aieis> well u mod voidrig's 4th, its has the most dmg ;3
[2022-12-17 10:57:32] <dxantonxdme> this is so cooooooo
[2022-12-17 10:57:33] <%Dsyphus> the voidrig has nutty burst dmg. and is super useful for eidolon hunts, if you dont wanna make a super specifit build
[2022-12-17 10:57:33] <ZazorokXIV> the 4th ability does a lot of concentrated damage to bosses but most of the time your frame will be stronker
[2022-12-17 10:57:37] <%+linksdx> silver , middlemouse button witht hat weapon
[2022-12-17 10:57:40] <Cheshire_S_Dragon> You can only use necromechs in railJack and open world
[2022-12-17 10:57:42] <Mudpebble> i like the sound of corn cob blankies, gonna use that from now on
[2022-12-17 10:57:44] <Sakatchi> Im weird and use bonewidow, and she never dies thanks to that meat hook of hers
[2022-12-17 10:57:45] <namesaretricky> Like, with the Eidolon earlier, there are builds that let them one shot body parts
[2022-12-17 10:57:46] <%+linksdx> it has secondry fire
[2022-12-17 10:57:47] <%Re4p3r626> I come back from a shower and all I see is Mechavale. What did I miss?
[2022-12-17 10:57:54] <Fizzycurl> Voidrig has some ridiculous survival and damage potential.
[2022-12-17 10:57:55] <XxElementZero> @Aieis haha artillery go brrt"
[2022-12-17 10:57:58] <ishiblacksnake> Voidrig give OP shield

[2022-12-17 10:58:21] <thenarratorzero> Mechs are basically pre-warframe era technology.
[2022-12-17 10:58:21] <+umbralmuse> they are very strong, but can only be used in open worlds and railjack, plus the first one you can make comes with easily one of the best arcguns

[2022-12-17 11:23:28] <TheeLamp> old content just dont spoil the story behind it
[2022-12-17 11:23:28] <+3PY0N> it's also tough sometimes to not spoil since that spoiler is like..6 years old or something
[2022-12-17 11:23:29] <+JRizel> I don't mind spoilers personally.
[2022-12-17 11:23:30] <thenarratorzero> Operator isn't a huge spoiler
[2022-12-17 11:23:32] <Belerofom> you will need more anyway
[2022-12-17 11:23:32] <%Midori_AKA_Ao> its hard not to spoil a game mechanic tbh
[2022-12-17 11:23:33] <%Dsyphus> operator was 2015 so much content needs it. it would be impossible to avoid
[2022-12-17 11:23:38] <SummonedSnake> Like I said Daughter Flirts hardcore with the Teno
[2022-12-17 11:23:39] <HungryGhostTree> it kinda sucks that operator is being spoiled because all the quests surrounding are really fuckin cool, bu
[2022-12-17 11:23:41] <%nerlyk> i don’t know what an operator is so not spoiled for me yet lol

[2022-12-17 11:24:08] <namesaretricky> Yeah, operator is tricky cause on one hand, it's spoilers, on the other, it's required for a lot of the game
[2022-12-17 11:24:10] <IronToe83> thats correct

[2022-12-17 11:24:55] <+fario6> Give Tokens to Grandmother for items
[2022-12-17 11:24:57] <thenarratorzero> Operators are complexing, until you actually do the quest though and so it's technically not even spoiling.

[2022-12-17 11:37:47] <+MikoNoPants> Vulps are essentially cats and use cat mods

[2022-12-17 11:37:52] <%Imperator_Starwing> Basically just cosmetic.
[2022-12-17 11:37:52] <ianskadoodles> it effects cosmetic and stats
[2022-12-17 11:37:53] <HungryGhostTree> these are previews
[2022-12-17 11:38:11] <pulse_man7> the predacites are there for stats

[2022-12-17 11:39:20] <Ir00nix> Kuburow isn't too painful, the pain is to scan kavats
[2022-12-17 11:39:21] <pulse_man7> yeah, Panzer Vulps are immortal
[2022-12-17 11:39:24] <%+Psychatix> I think Fortuna has the wors tpet system
[2022-12-17 11:39:24] <%SnowyKrow> @fario6 all vulpaphyla are immortal
[2022-12-17 11:39:27] <%sansnom22> all vulps are immortal, panzers are the meta because viral quills
[2022-12-17 11:39:28] <sowingcrawdad> Robo dog and invested dog will always be my favorites
[2022-12-17 11:39:30] <+MikoNoPants> Smeetas are ok but adarza has it's own charm too
[2022-12-17 11:39:30] <Gundummy> Kudrow is much easier
[2022-12-17 11:39:33] <%perscal> Do you know about Helminth Chargers?
[2022-12-17 11:39:34] <kovac4smash> One of these can be literally immortal
[2022-12-17 11:39:36] <ZenniStardust> I'm STILL using my Vacuum bot thing; I'm super old school
[2022-12-17 11:39:37] <%+linksdx> need the dart gun from fortuna
[2022-12-17 11:39:38] <cattolyst17> You can exchange their tags for floofs
[2022-12-17 11:39:39] <ceran73> I guess i have to reinstall Warframe now uh
[2022-12-17 11:39:41] <HungryGhostTree> oh ALL the vulps have the immortality?
[2022-12-17 11:39:46] <HungryGhostTree> i thought only panzer did
[2022-12-17 11:39:46] <sir_deadlock> I so very much wish that the tranq gun worked on animals in missions. Would be so much easier tranqing wild kavats in the void than trying to scan them while they run around.

[2022-12-17 11:40:08] <+fario6> Only Panzer is immortal

[2022-12-17 11:40:15] <Zogzor> It's really good cause the Vulpaphyla can regenerate forever so you never lose the radar and vacuum buffs from them
[2022-12-17 11:40:26] <kurokubi_> aaaahhhh that sound

[2022-12-17 13:05:53] <+umbralmuse> it has bonuses because it is a Dark sector, which was related to a now defunct PVP mode that was phased out  and removed

[2022-12-17 13:06:17] <PigWithoutProtection> @Gundummy I had a mele Oberon phase. hes good at keeping a team alive with the augment to his healing ability.

[2022-12-17 13:07:38] <operator_verona> its like rescue if the rescue target acted like they don't wanna get rescued
[2022-12-17 13:07:44] <GotESDrew> Wisp makes this mission tolerable. Another reason why She is Worth it!
[2022-12-17 13:07:48] <sizzlinpheonix> @kevinslunchbox warframe is generally ez but defection is horrible gotta protect fragile people and good luck if the pathing bugs out and they get stuck without a nova/loki
[2022-12-17 13:07:56] <John_TheRevelator> @travis_teaspoon yes, the pain BibleThump NotLikeThis

[2022-12-17 13:08:37] <%+Aekrid> the Red Veil Operatives would always give me trouble if I'm not on top of them the moment they spawn
[2022-12-17 13:08:44] <PigWithoutProtection> yea the game has a sense of being speedy and doing missions fast, then they throw a mission where you have to wait for slow NPC pathing. kind of jarring.

[2022-12-17 13:11:15] <happysmile42> FYI, Wall Jumping used to be an exploit and when Warframe went to remove it, the players rioted (not really) and they decided to incorporate it into the game!

[2022-12-17 13:12:33] <PigWithoutProtection> hm if you extract without the rest, they will get a Host Migration, since Silver is the host
[2022-12-17 13:12:34] <Bananas_dot_exe> Not always. Used to only be able to leave if majority wanted to leave
[2022-12-17 13:12:36] <%+Sonicboy321> You can leave with Your rewards
[2022-12-17 13:12:37] <KevinsLunchbox> grineer manic nice
[2022-12-17 13:12:44] <Hostilefox87> If you are host you should announce that you are leaving before you leave. This way they have an option to leave. Because no one likes host migrations.
[2022-12-17 13:12:47] <ZenniStardust> Wait you can? I could never find that option
[2022-12-17 13:12:50] <sir_deadlock> When is a door not a door? When it's ajar.
[2022-12-17 13:12:58] <Gundummy> it doesn't effect them they can leave whenever just like you

[2022-12-17 13:29:30] <Zadik117> There is a weekly mission for a statue
[2022-12-17 13:29:30] <its_r0ss> rare occurence, but for me, its more likely to happen than getting my wanted prime part nyxthe2Wheeze
[2022-12-17 13:29:39] <Sora117> in ancient times, during the times of the Shogun. if a samurai were to fail his daimyo, he would chop off his pinkies as a sign of forgiveness
[2022-12-17 13:29:39] <Sora117> I think
[2022-12-17 13:29:39] <+TheOneFlackman> there is a weekly guaranteed one through Maroo

[2022-12-17 13:37:35] <AgrodElx> there is a game on screen?
[2022-12-17 13:37:42] <SentryGolem> don't worry about the map, the entire screen is exploding
[2022-12-17 13:37:42] <+chippler582> It's niche there's no incentive for endurance runs
[2022-12-17 13:37:42] <%Amp_Hiptere> It's transparent enough it isnt really an issue

[2022-12-17 13:37:55] <$Kabraxis_42> You have a Skyrim brain
[2022-12-17 13:37:59] <+MonotoneHero> When you game enough, you just open everything resembling a box
[2022-12-17 13:38:00] <zzerooprime> the lockers in orange door is useful
[2022-12-17 13:38:05] <epiloguewrits> Only worthwhile lockers are those in railjack missions
[2022-12-17 13:38:08] <+MonotoneHero> Even if it's useless
[2022-12-17 13:38:11] <4greaper> looting all the things is typical rpg logic.

[2022-12-17 13:41:30] <ReconWarrior> @hoonigan603 well u can never have 100% of all frames anyway since excal prime was beta founder buy only
[2022-12-17 13:41:37] <+chippler582> You can also trade with other players for old currently vaulted primes
[2022-12-17 13:41:40] <+Vakiiri> @Silvervale Ahhh I remember the game more now, the vomiting of partical effects right into my eyeballs SMILE

[2022-12-17 14:44:25] <asj_wastaken> You need to physically see one of the enemies in the dome and hit them for it to have the AOE

[2022-12-17 14:44:40] <Alpha_Mur> either Lua or Railjack
[2022-12-17 14:44:41] <%Travis_Teaspoon> You can use the NECRAMECHs in this mission
[2022-12-17 14:44:41] <+chippler582> No just in conjunction
[2022-12-17 14:44:43] <hobo_in_space108> certain missions u can
[2022-12-17 14:44:44] <AiisDadi> only there
[2022-12-17 14:44:47] <Sarnage555> Only in these 2 specific Lua missions.
[2022-12-17 14:44:50] <ArchonDeaths> the mech are limited to these 2 mission
[2022-12-17 14:44:55] <ArchonDeaths> and there also a time limite on them
[2022-12-17 14:44:56] <Mlane1999> This gametype is special and lets you use it here! Otherwise in Railjack missions or open worlds x3
[2022-12-17 14:44:58] <ByRoyalCommandV> necramechs have a 2 minute time limit here too
[2022-12-17 14:45:02] <ArchonDeaths> so you cant have it out all the time
[2022-12-17 14:45:06] <Lekais> Mechs are only Railjack, open worlds and these two missions.
[2022-12-17 14:45:07] <Kalina_Hitana> and you have a two minute timer
[2022-12-17 14:45:08] <supermaniop> you can't use necramechs anywhere, some missions allow it (Free roam, and conjunction, mostly)
[2022-12-17 14:45:10] <PigWithoutProtection> What is the benefit of a Mech over a warframe?
[2022-12-17 14:45:15] <Alpha_Mur> @whatshiruka the bonewidow nechramech looks dope but its not as good  as voidrig imo
[2022-12-17 14:45:16] <voidzxyq> necramechs are just chunky old warframes
[2022-12-17 14:45:18] <Kailie> you can use the mech in railjack and open world missions
[2022-12-17 14:45:22] <Sarnage555> Strong independent Khora don't need to mech. ☝
[2022-12-17 14:45:25] <Aqua_Chill_> No would be a good time to level your new mech up
[2022-12-17 14:45:28] <Alpha_Mur> @PigWithoutProtection consistent void damage
[2022-12-17 14:45:30] <Alpha_Mur> more dmg
[2022-12-17 14:45:34] <Aqua_Chill_> Now*
[2022-12-17 14:45:36] <+chippler582> The mech does like 2 billion dmg a hit with Arquebex

[2022-12-17 15:03:50] <Lekais> One of the vulpaphyla has a special where if it dies, it turns into a sort of sentinel and then auto-respawn
[2022-12-17 15:03:56] <Lieria84> its the form his kitty takes when it dies, then respawns a min later
[2022-12-17 15:03:59] <PigWithoutProtection> vulpas?

[2022-12-17 15:04:07] <%Travis_Teaspoon> When a Vulpa dies it goes back into a Larva then respawns shorrtly later
