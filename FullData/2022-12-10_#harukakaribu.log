[2022-12-10 02:19:07] <%wolfpackmn> My first shiny was Boldure which looks like diamonds when its fully evolved
[2022-12-10 02:19:10] <elbristhebindingblade> my first shiny was a manky
[2022-12-10 02:19:17] <PossessionCrash> ...did you beat the game now?
[2022-12-10 02:19:21] <%+NamelessTrickster> haruchiCry I'm so confused. I thought milcery was your first shiny, and you killed it.
[2022-12-10 02:19:28] <+TJOmega> First shiny in Violet was Scyther, my favorite 'mon.
[2022-12-10 02:19:34] <wispy_ace> I have yet to get a shiny, I have only encountered 1 shiny lillipup, and accidentally killed it

[2022-12-10 02:19:38] <soniczillaproject> I do like the shiny venomoth then the normal venomoth
[2022-12-10 02:19:39] <luckyblock98twitch> my first shiny was a Bellsprout, not a great shiny, but I got it in Rumble, first in this game was Corviknight
[2022-12-10 02:19:43] <%$Photonwolf140> ...Now I need to look up shiny Venomoth

[2022-12-10 02:21:42] <%imposabear64> Is haruka a god pokemon?
[2022-12-10 02:21:42] <PossessionCrash> @luckyblock98twitch I have one shiny Alcremie (And a shiny Milcery, there was a Sword/Shield raid event that had them,) but it's actually easier since you can get all of them in one game unlike Vivillon, which has to be gen 6, you get one out of 20 on your own, and two are event only (One of them you can get in gen 9 shiny)
[2022-12-10 02:21:44] <%$I_Am_JarvisTM> Looks like an olive green, if I had to guess
[2022-12-10 02:21:48] <%LundeaDeRune> I wanna pet Polterpup

[2022-12-10 02:22:58] <ichigo1692> because the Red Gyarados

[2022-12-10 02:23:09] <ruurikovt> i also remembered randomly catching a shiny lokix
[2022-12-10 02:23:11] <%wolfpackmn> Ash Noctowl was the first shiny based off its in game counterpart
[2022-12-10 02:23:12] <MetsuTeras> 1st Confirmed Shiny was Gyurados I belive.

[2022-12-10 02:23:32] <%Fluffyshinigami> I assume this is Haruka's third evolution stage

[2022-12-10 02:24:22] <%imposabear64> interesting
[2022-12-10 02:24:23] <Stonecreek_KC> Two shinies in a couple days is still pretty damn good luck.
[2022-12-10 02:24:24] <%Snoozy_Z_Bear> it was gen 2 when they add color to the game, because gen 1 was monochromatic
[2022-12-10 02:24:24] <luckyblock98twitch> Technically, in Gen 1, you could get the Shiny Birds but you'd need the right stam
[2022-12-10 02:24:29] <%+Heroofmaui> you can leave and return to the area for new spawns
[2022-12-10 02:24:33] <%$MrGamecube17> you're not gonna reset the encounters via picnic?

[2022-12-10 02:24:58] <%$MrGamecube17> You can start a picnic to reset the spawns too

It might just be because of the personality you put into him. I want to see you guys succeed, matter of fact i want all of them to succeed, Lil piss boi, Polterpup, Sniffa, all of em. Why does the funny anime deer spirit have better charecter development than the licensed anime
