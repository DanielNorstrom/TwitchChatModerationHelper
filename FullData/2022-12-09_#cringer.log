[2022-12-09 12:35:55] <%Soviet666> this time for Cringer
[2022-12-09 12:35:59] <Sax850> also I'm really happy to get a new super giant game but I'm honestly disappointed its a Hades sequel
[2022-12-09 12:36:02] <%+kewlkwkurt> I did love seeing a date for Diablo 4
[2022-12-09 12:36:07] <%HouseOfDoggus> Ancient Cities

[2022-12-09 12:37:18] <%JohnDoeRadio> yeah, dark souls lookin

[2022-12-09 12:37:33] <stretch_marx> new armored core though
[2022-12-09 12:37:35] <%JohnDoeRadio> nightingale looked really incredible
[2022-12-09 12:37:36] <Chimerared> I like what Steam did, allowing people who played games to name the genres rather than trying to fit them into a corporate box.
[2022-12-09 12:37:52] <Chimerared> The game awards should do something similar
[2022-12-09 12:37:56] <Sax850> Tunic or Neon White should've won :C
[2022-12-09 12:38:20] <%HouseOfDoggus> I legit watched on mute while watching Raiders vs Rams

[2022-12-09 12:39:51] <%Soviet666> that was fun

[2022-12-09 12:41:23] <%JohnDoeRadio> yeah

[2022-12-09 12:44:03] <Nywro> Elden Ring not in Action somehow.
[2022-12-09 12:44:06] <%Soviet666> it was a pretty mediocre year for AAA
[2022-12-09 12:44:22] <+mouday> @Soviet666 true
[2022-12-09 12:44:26] <HiFiPanda> @Soviet666 So a normal AAA year..
[2022-12-09 12:44:36] <Bossasaurus> We're trying
[2022-12-09 12:44:45] <%Soviet666> and Stray getting award for indie surprise and not Vampire Survivors was a steal

[2022-12-09 12:45:25] <%JohnDoeRadio> stray deserves it
[2022-12-09 12:45:32] <%JohnDoeRadio> game is designed very well
[2022-12-09 12:45:37] <DAZLAND81> I hope the suicide squad game is decent as it's Kevin Conway last performance on batman
[2022-12-09 12:45:52] <%Soviet666> and Ludwig getting an award for influencer instead of Cringer was a total bs
[2022-12-09 12:46:27] <Dragonator_g> I never heard of that mario game before this morning.
[2022-12-09 12:46:41] <%Soviet666> it was a famous franchise though cringeHAHA

[2022-12-09 12:48:46] <%Soviet666> so many genre pushing, like the famous revolutionary director Hideo Kojima who's making a sequel cringeHAHA

[2022-12-09 13:43:56] <%FlareSN> i think the better material you use to make like a ring for example increases the price and then it goes up more when you add gems and stuff

[2022-12-09 13:45:54] <+Fogia99> But if it is invaluable, is it less or more ?
[2022-12-09 13:45:58] <ChromeViper> pvpNote
[2022-12-09 13:45:58] <%PrincessNatashika> There will not be a correct answer to this question xD
[2022-12-09 13:46:03] <+Specimen47> the materials matter more than what the item is
[2022-12-09 13:46:10] <Durin01> From wiki: Item value is determined by a number of factors: the form of the item, the material it is made out of, the quality of its creation, and any decorations on it.  The final value of an item is the base value of the form of the item (e.g. block or statue) multiplied by the material multiplier (e.g. granite or gold), multiplied by the quality modifier (e.g. fine or masterful) if any, then summed with the final value of all decorations.
[2022-12-09 13:46:17] <Aquahelix> I'll give you three thousand!
[2022-12-09 13:46:31] <+Specimen47> also skill of the crafter matters

[2022-12-09 13:47:29] <djuice_> Yes, its more valuable, but the material value is different.
[2022-12-09 13:47:33] <+Specimen47> ooooh i misunderstood the question xD
[2022-12-09 13:47:46] <+ElTankoJoe> Imma skim the wiki real quick on immigration, I think there's another factor
[2022-12-09 13:47:50] <+Specimen47> ofc 2000value items are worth more than 20 items
[2022-12-09 13:47:54] <djuice_> So its value.
[2022-12-09 13:47:54] <sanchopanzo> price is not value
[2022-12-09 13:48:08] <Aquahelix> Maybe it's sentimental value... LUL

[2022-12-09 13:49:42] <+ElTankoJoe> Ok so it's total created wealth, not exported. As well as revealed/mined tiles. However this is only calculated yearly, when your caravan arrives.
[2022-12-09 13:50:50] <MF_Satsum> did the block of wood and the block of plastic costs the same, post construction?
[2022-12-09 13:50:53] <Aquahelix> Finally some philosophy. What is the value of value chat?
[2022-12-09 13:50:55] <+Smiffus> Is it a trading luxury items thing? Not so much the value of it? (note: I have no idea, haven't played the game)
[2022-12-09 13:50:59] <+Specimen47> keep in mind when it comes to attracting migrants u dont only want to sell good stuff, u want to add value to your fort, like make a gold floor or silver walls
[2022-12-09 13:51:02] <MF_Satsum> pre constr
[2022-12-09 13:51:03] <Mad_Macks> can we throw idiots in chat in to the river?
[2022-12-09 13:51:03] <%$PathFinder20> encrusted goblin testicles
[2022-12-09 13:51:03] <%+bh3x> there is a value multiplier for each material and you can find that in wiki
[2022-12-09 13:51:09] <+Noroth101> you have to give them more than you buy so for exaple buy 100bucks worth of stuff but sell them 2000buck worth
[2022-12-09 13:51:09] <+ElTankoJoe> Depends on how badly you need a sword at the time
[2022-12-09 13:51:10] <Durin01> there is no real currency in the game. it is trade based. so every item has the material value multiplied by the item typ value

[2022-12-09 13:51:45] <Aquahelix> Look at an item and see if it has more than one "value"
[2022-12-09 13:52:02] <KillMolly> I think I understand but you might be assuming DF is completely fleshed out. Some things just dont make sense and you got to accept things as just is.
[2022-12-09 13:52:02] <Durin01> gold sword > iron sword iron sword > iron craft
[2022-12-09 13:52:06] <+ElTankoJoe> However for your question, it is quantified in game.
[2022-12-09 13:52:10] <%+bh3x> there is no monetary values in DF currently, it is just barter value now
[2022-12-09 13:52:12] <%+bh3x> https://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/DF2014:Item_value
[2022-12-09 13:52:20] <+Specimen47> sidenote, an elf will not pay well for iron items so they value that less than other dwarfs would
[2022-12-09 13:52:30] <elearne> dwarves will give a higher value to certain items then elves per say for the same item, it coul seel for 1000 to a dwarf and a elf would not even deem it worth 10
[2022-12-09 13:52:33] <%+bh3x> economy is not in place
[2022-12-09 13:52:44] <KillMolly> A beard comb made of metal will be more valuable thAN A BEARD CONB MADE OF WOOD
[2022-12-09 13:52:45] <%$k_nord> As far as I gather “value” shown is based on your brokers skill, so they can be wrong
[2022-12-09 13:52:59] <KillMolly> ah sorry caps
[2022-12-09 13:53:01] <!%Aavak> Yeah Cringer, judging only a conversation I joined half way through, I think chat is tripping up on the idea of what is measured when people say value. Based on what you just explained though, if you're asking about economic triggers (like kingdoms deciding you look tasty and want to raid you for them sweet sweet dollarydoos) then it's more or less the monetary value traded (more or less because traders will inflate the price a bit based on contracts etc)
[2022-12-09 13:53:13] <+Specimen47> if u wanna attract immigrant, get gold walls and floors, theyll come running
[2022-12-09 13:53:31] VIEWERS: 480
[2022-12-09 13:53:33] <sanchopanzo> value could also mean its usefulness, but maybe not in this game
[2022-12-09 13:53:58] <Aquahelix> Shit I'll immigrate if you have gold floors.

[2022-12-09 13:54:13] <semmy1981> @Cringer can you still capture invaders.... steal everything and than have your soldiers practice on them in an custom build arena/collesuem?
[2022-12-09 13:54:16] <+Specimen47> the problem with your question is that monetary value differs between factions
[2022-12-09 13:54:18] <!%Aavak> Hmm, could you do me a quick favour and check your civilisation for me on the map screen?
[2022-12-09 13:54:29] <+ElTankoJoe> For game purposes, value is a number attached to an item, based on quality and material
[2022-12-09 13:54:38] <!%Aavak> You might have made a fort for a civilisation with a very low pop.
[2022-12-09 13:54:44] <Durin01> that can have other factors too. Is your civ alive? is your embark dangerous? did many dwarfs die?
[2022-12-09 13:54:46] <!%Aavak> One of the civs on my world had exactly 5 dwarfs in it XD
[2022-12-09 13:54:50] <H4dus> does supply and demand effect price in this game?
[2022-12-09 13:54:51] <!%Aavak> No migrants'll come from them.
[2022-12-09 13:54:54] <Aquahelix> I thought you just had to stick a bunch of statues and stuff in your meeting hall to attract immigrants..
[2022-12-09 13:54:55] <Sax850> Anything worth over 10000 value is high value stuff to me
[2022-12-09 13:55:05] <+ElTankoJoe> If your civilization was dead or dying at the start, you get little to no migrants.
[2022-12-09 13:55:10] <HiFiPanda> @Durin01 <-- That
[2022-12-09 13:55:14] <%Soviet666> I dump mussel shells worth literally zero coins on the trader and I have no problems getting imigrants
[2022-12-09 13:55:18] <!%Aavak> What's your civ though? You'll have started from a certain civ, even if you moved a whole world away.
[2022-12-09 13:55:23] <+Specimen47> oooooooh
[2022-12-09 13:55:23] <%Soviet666> so you're crazy chat
[2022-12-09 13:55:23] <%+kirbygloverredux> lol there's your problem

[2022-12-09 13:55:29] <%+bh3x> its part of it

[2022-12-09 13:56:11] <!%Aavak> If they have a lot of forts, they almost certainly have lots of people to send over, but if they like only have one or two, it might be that there just aren't enough migrants.

[2022-12-09 13:57:58] <!%Aavak> Okay, so there's something you can do that's better than trading; you can send gifts to the homlands via the liaison.
[2022-12-09 13:58:03] <%JohnDoeRadio> what happens if you try to kill the merchant seq1
[2022-12-09 13:58:17] <+ElTankoJoe> Migrants are also calculated based on tiles revealed, maybe mine more?
[2022-12-09 13:58:22] <+Specimen47> id improve ur fort with better materials
[2022-12-09 13:58:23] <Aquahelix> Face it, your people are to lazy to walk over.
[2022-12-09 13:58:41] <!%Aavak> Gifts sent home have a heavier attraction pull than raw trades (because it's basically /all/ profit for them)
[2022-12-09 13:58:55] <Sax850> yeah thats why i always give some gift
[2022-12-09 13:58:58] <Sax850> gifts
[2022-12-09 13:59:17] <!%Aavak> Ya
[2022-12-09 13:59:17] <Durin01> when I started my fort I didn't get any migrant waves for the first few years too
[2022-12-09 13:59:19] <+Specimen47> a legendary craft would also help
[2022-12-09 13:59:22] <Aquahelix> Seduce the traders. Word will spread.
[2022-12-09 13:59:31] <+ElTankoJoe> There's a "make offering" option I think
[2022-12-09 13:59:31] <Sax850> No, there is a specific thing where you say its a gift
[2022-12-09 13:59:33] VIEWERS: 515
[2022-12-09 13:59:34] <%Soviet666> theres a gift button in trade window
[2022-12-09 13:59:34] <!%Aavak> Basically you give the trader stuff to send back to the king on your behalf.
[2022-12-09 13:59:37] <wulfbiter> @Aavak spoken like a true bard
[2022-12-09 13:59:42] <Sax850> but making trades where they make a lot of profit works well too
[2022-12-09 14:00:07] <%HydroSqueegee> was it ever figured out how big you can make a room without caving in?
[2022-12-09 14:00:18] <Durin01> The number of migrants depends on the created wealth of your fortress and so is affected by your dwarves' activities.
[2022-12-09 14:00:19] <Sax850> you can mine out a whole z-level
[2022-12-09 14:00:27] <+Specimen47> im think that noble can atually check the value ratings
[2022-12-09 14:00:31] <Sax850> there is no structure calculation in DF
[2022-12-09 14:00:43] <Durin01> start engraving and craft
[2022-12-09 14:00:48] <+ElTankoJoe> Nah you can hollow out a whole level if you want
[2022-12-09 14:01:02] <%HydroSqueegee> man i swear it would collapse back in the day
[2022-12-09 14:01:04] <Sax850> you'd have to go from the level above and mine out the connecting walls to the edges of the map then it can collapse
[2022-12-09 14:01:08] <%HydroSqueegee> but that was a looong time ago
[2022-12-09 14:01:19] <%HydroSqueegee> ahhhh
[2022-12-09 14:01:22] <Durin01> how much "created wealth" do you have?

[2022-12-09 14:10:44] <Sax850> i do enjoy the mouse support but my favorite part of the old UI/control scheme was that it was fully keyboard controlled. I prefer using the keyboard over mouse.
[2022-12-09 14:10:46] <%HydroSqueegee> i almost miss ASCII.  it has charm.  But man, having a mouse is nice

[2022-12-09 14:12:14] <Durin01> @Call_me_Luck3y because it also lets you shirnk the stockpile

[2022-12-09 14:15:45] <Durin01> the "Problem" with goblins is that they are immortal like elves. So their population just keeps growing and growing

[2022-12-09 14:15:48] <Sax850> a lot of streamers are getting into it
[2022-12-09 14:15:50] <%+Celebrim1> Give up I mean
[2022-12-09 14:15:54] <+kriztifa> hey cringer
[2022-12-09 14:16:04] <%+FataltheBaptist> some could use maybe a guide to help them through the first run
[2022-12-09 14:16:35] <destinys_parent> its a hype game but its hardcore so that is natural i think
[2022-12-09 14:16:41] <+Arrican> I watched someone play ixion for 5 minutes yesterday and then quit.  Then logged into df and couldn't get the screen right then quit.  lol
[2022-12-09 14:16:42] <%SoralTheSol> Bahroo gave up after reading the tutorial, I don't mind though.  It is like Boshy, it takes a certain person to play Dwarf Fortress.
[2022-12-09 14:16:45] <Sax850> I could say the same about Paradox games.

[2022-12-09 14:17:38] <Dragonator_g> I started IXION, saw the GDPR non-compliant data collection, didn't find any options, closed it and refunded it.
[2022-12-09 14:17:48] <%JohnDoeRadio> yeah, the only part that sucked is this game has endless content if he dug it
[2022-12-09 14:17:49] <+Specimen47> the biggest problem for DF seems to be how hidden its depth is
[2022-12-09 14:17:54] <SuburbanWombat> as someone getting it to it the first timer the lack of info is bad the wiki is out of date ands videos are all old game to you have to make a leap about stuff
[2022-12-09 14:18:15] <Sax850> @Dragonator_g yeah thats what killed Ixion for me, I ain't going to touch anything like that
[2022-12-09 14:18:17] <+Arrican> @SuburbanWombat just jump out of the plane without the parachute.
[2022-12-09 14:18:25] <SuburbanWombat> yep
[2022-12-09 14:18:35] <%Eskylious> @UniMatrixJohnny so unbelievably punishing, but my goodness is it fun and rewarding.
[2022-12-09 14:18:38] <%JohnDoeRadio> the wildlife killing me and me not knowing why almost broke me day 1 a few times lol
[2022-12-09 14:18:44] <Durin01> @Aavak when a "tomb" site location says less than 10 population, do you know if undead are counted towards the total?
[2022-12-09 14:18:46] <Sax850> I like Ixion as a concept but nope on that front.
[2022-12-09 14:18:46] <+Arrican> I mean, intimidating games - Dad Shower Simulator... I'm really intimidated by that... too much swinging stuff in there.
[2022-12-09 14:18:48] <derped_up> @SuburbanWombat while the wki is "out of date" the info is still mostly correct
[2022-12-09 14:19:01] <+Telzgul> Like valorant
[2022-12-09 14:19:06] <%UniMatrixJohnny> @Eskylious so not "unfairly punishing" like some of the reviews say?
[2022-12-09 14:19:07] <unicronboi> whats the artifacts section?
[2022-12-09 14:19:18] <Nywro> @JohnDoeRadio Blame that one on a bug sadly. LUL
[2022-12-09 14:19:25] <%FlareSN> the amount of positivity in the steam reviews for the game make me happy
[2022-12-09 14:19:33] <SuburbanWombat> and then theirs the bug /crashes im having a good time but its a lot more frustrating than it need to be

[2022-12-09 14:19:40] <derped_up> DF is the Darksouls/tarkov of civ games
[2022-12-09 14:19:46] <+Arrican> Yeah, rimworld took me a good 20-30 restarts before I really got deep into it.
[2022-12-09 14:19:52] <+Specimen47> its artifacts in the world @unicronboi  like a legendary item crafted by one of the dwarves, or an item in a goblin fort
[2022-12-09 14:20:00] <%Eskylious> @UniMatrixJohnny definitely not, most crises are just due to being unprepared. They give you all the tools and materials. The station is truly in your hands and thats how ive felt all the way into my inevitable burnout towards the end of chapter 3.
[2022-12-09 14:20:15] <%SoralTheSol> Bahroo plays rimworld, and he plays it rather well, it is just, DF is complex and Dense.  When you are new to it it is very much a learning cliff.
[2022-12-09 14:20:19] <unicronboi> @Specimen47 that's really cool, do you have to send raiding parties to get them? can you make them yourself?
[2022-12-09 14:20:20] <b3_billeybob250> can this be modded?
[2022-12-09 14:20:33] <Dragonator_g> I don't get that "Stream the hot thing". Does that work? I imagine you'd want to stand out instead of getting lost in a sea of everyone doing the same thing.
[2022-12-09 14:20:36] <+Arrican> @b3_billeybob250 I'm pretty sure it can, not sure anyone has made any yet.
[2022-12-09 14:20:49] <Sax850> I'd say Rimworld is almost as much to learn as DF, sure Df is clunkier but just because its deeper doesnt mean it you need to learn everything
[2022-12-09 14:20:58] <+Arrican> @Dragonator_g I mean, it sounds like you're judging me sitting in my hot tub... Kappa
[2022-12-09 14:21:16] <derped_up> but you learn from your mistakes (aka FUN)
[2022-12-09 14:21:23] <+Specimen47> @unicronboi u can make them yourself, sometimes other factions craft them, i once made a legendary engraved statue, wich after skipping 2k years i recovered from goblins
[2022-12-09 14:21:27] <Kanyenke> i unfollopwed bahroo a few days ago - the stream became a tad just too salty for me

[2022-12-09 14:22:22] <$LordPolish> SO you need full focus
[2022-12-09 14:22:29] <+Arrican> A few hours?  Sheesh, I'm good for about 5 minutes... oh, learning star sector... my bad.  Nevermind...
[2022-12-09 14:22:41] <Sax850> It's just such a shame with Ixion, it looks cool but I just can't try it as it is currently.
[2022-12-09 14:22:55] <%wickwrack> Early Starsector games can end abruptly
[2022-12-09 14:23:00] <derped_up> DF is kinda a good stream game, its not super fast paced at points
[2022-12-09 14:23:02] <Nywro> My brain is just so RPG old that games like this make more sense to it.
[2022-12-09 14:23:07] <Sax850> I love Starsector though
[2022-12-09 14:23:12] <Dragonator_g> @LordPolish It's quite the opposite for me. Starsector is one of the "turn brain off" game. It's quite forgiving, especially if you save often and don't mind savescumming.
[2022-12-09 14:23:13] <+CreteTTV> some games are also MORE entertaining when the streamer is just learning them, live
[2022-12-09 14:23:34] <$LordPolish> @Dragonator_g OK well if you are savescumming...yeah mistakes don't matter.

[2022-12-09 14:24:26] <unicronboi> this game looks so cosy

[2022-12-09 14:28:59] <GiantMonsterGames> yes that is what is in the bin BUT you cant see what all is in that stockpile with a singe click. AKA no seeing what is in all the bins.

[2022-12-09 15:43:13] <aarpia> @moppnitz You can also throw water onto rock flooring and that will make mud you can farm on

[2022-12-09 16:03:54] <+jayjack2> Also will they do random tasks if that job isnt needed atm or is he locked into the job? Such a deep game. love it.

[2022-12-09 16:04:26] <+imscomobob> yes, as long as you have that green hammer square next to their jobs they will do random assigned jobs based on their skill level - highest skill level is picked first by the manager
[2022-12-09 16:04:37] <+jayjack2> @imscomobob are tasks different then assigned jobs (titled ones)\
[2022-12-09 16:04:37] <%JohnDoeRadio> fair enough
[2022-12-09 16:04:54] <+imscomobob> Yes, jobs consist of tasks
[2022-12-09 16:05:08] <%JohnDoeRadio> ok so it does assign them by manager,  and those menus are to assign them yourself
[2022-12-09 16:05:11] <+jayjack2> @imscomobob thanks for the info. Think im going to buy this game.
[2022-12-09 16:05:16] <isaaccccccccccccccccccc> whos the one dorf thats absolutely livid right now
[2022-12-09 16:05:21] <Siilis108> To make high value stuff youll need to assign specific stone masons, carpenters, engravers e.c.
[2022-12-09 16:05:22] <+imscomobob> STRIKE THE EARTH!
[2022-12-09 16:05:37] <Siilis108> Because hes not good at it
[2022-12-09 16:05:41] <+imscomobob> he will always prioritize the assigned job over rando jobs
[2022-12-09 16:05:57] <harzyar> so it's twitchcon

[2022-12-09 16:06:08] <+imscomobob> he may just hate his job...
[2022-12-09 16:06:11] <Sax850> needs mugs
[2022-12-09 16:06:12] <Siilis108> You need a cabinet to store the mugs inside the taver
[2022-12-09 16:06:12] <%wickwrack> They heard you have nude goblins
[2022-12-09 16:06:16] <+jayjack2> Maybe he is in AA
[2022-12-09 16:06:33] <Siilis108> Place a stockpile for drink then
[2022-12-09 16:06:35] <+jayjack2> Need contact with his sponser
[2022-12-09 16:06:42] <Anna_Kaos> It has a stockpile for drink
[2022-12-09 16:06:46] <+imscomobob> if you go into your tavernkeepr job and unselect the green hammer square, he will only tavernkeep
[2022-12-09 16:07:08] <@%$Asiak> @Anna_Kaos Me every weekend
[2022-12-09 16:07:17] <%Meithar> He probably lost his dwarf issued bar towel and can't clean the mugs, so he roams aimlessly in shame
[2022-12-09 16:07:29] <+JJROKCZ> hopefully thats lots of Ale!
[2022-12-09 16:07:33] <isaaccccccccccccccccccc> ah thats makes sense as to why it might not have worked
[2022-12-09 16:07:46] <+imscomobob> the best way to manage alcohol is to make another stockpile and have them only take stuff from the main stockpile... but thats kinda complicated...
[2022-12-09 16:07:49] <Anna_Kaos> I thought it was already covered my bad
[2022-12-09 16:07:56] <+JJROKCZ> should we not mine out a side room for alcohol storage instead of sticking it in the middle? lol

[2022-12-09 16:08:13] <@%$Asiak> Why JJ?
[2022-12-09 16:08:21] <@%$Asiak> I mean maybe but for what movement speed?
[2022-12-09 16:08:23] <@%$Asiak> maybe
[2022-12-09 16:08:24] <Siilis108> They should be drinking it now I think
[2022-12-09 16:08:28] <%Meithar> Self serve open bar
[2022-12-09 16:08:33] <+imscomobob> if they have too much free time, they will start only drinking and partying and your fortress will slowly spiral into chaos...
[2022-12-09 16:08:45] <+Depew17> they like hanging around by the kegs, just like us
[2022-12-09 16:09:00] <%Arazaki> idle dwarfs drink too much alcohol, loaded up my save today to find i had no drinks at all
[2022-12-09 16:09:04] <Anna_Kaos> Party spirals are less likely since forever ago
[2022-12-09 16:09:11] <Siilis108> Put him on tavern work only

[2022-12-09 16:12:58] <ShogunStreams> i've found the tutorials to be pretty helpful but I'm also watching YT vids and streams and whatnot
[2022-12-09 16:13:22] <Anna_Kaos> I miss the bug where cats would walk through the tavern, lick their paws, and get alcohol poisoning from the floor beer on their paws.
[2022-12-09 16:13:26] <warchild421> This seems to be very much a game you need two monitors for, one for the game, one for the wiki
[2022-12-09 16:13:31] <ShogunStreams> tooltips would be FUCKING NICE
[2022-12-09 16:13:41] <%+imscomobob> there is a ? in the top right with WAY WAY WAY more tutorials

[2022-12-09 16:15:24] <jayjack2> What effect do the entertainers have on your Fort?
[2022-12-09 16:15:26] <+SomeNerdWithaBeard> BARD FIGHT

[2022-12-09 16:16:55] <Anna_Kaos> You can assign a permanent entertainer in the tavern menu like the tavern keeper too

[2022-12-09 16:18:53] <%JohnDoeRadio> yes
[2022-12-09 16:18:55] <%+imscomobob> I think you have to make bedrooms that are part of your inn/tavern so they can rent out those rooms... I think...
[2022-12-09 16:19:20] <+Helix26> Beds could be assigned to taverns in classic, I haven't tried it in the most recent
[2022-12-09 16:19:32] <%+imscomobob> yeah, you can still do that @Helix26
[2022-12-09 16:19:47] <+Rucu1> This game is uber complicated
[2022-12-09 16:20:02] <Anna_Kaos> So they may only be residents and not citizens but they will apply for citizenship eventually
[2022-12-09 16:20:04] <Siilis108> You can still assign them

[2022-12-09 17:18:32] <%Arazaki> if you have a seed stockpile, there is a bug where seeds get put into bags which get put into barrels, and dwarves cant find them. so make sure pure seed stockpiles take no barrels

[2022-12-09 17:32:54] <%Arazaki> instruments are always procedurally generated, its so awesome. some instruments are small and put in chests in temples and taverns, others are large and need to be placed via the furniture menu
[2022-12-09 17:33:03] <keshire> Procedurally generated instruments. Might be some wild stuff in that list.
[2022-12-09 17:33:06] <+Kanbyen> Do you have a hospital setup yet?
[2022-12-09 17:33:30] <rudess> you can setup a endless work order to decorate with shell, im not sure how successful it is but im trying it on my world lol

[2022-12-09 17:34:48] <+Kanbyen> you want wealth down not up
[2022-12-09 17:34:53] <rudess> when you say accidentally do you mean you accidentally selling it or will the dwarves do that on their own? @Kanbyen
[2022-12-09 17:34:58] <Hekios888> might be a guild ?

[2022-12-09 17:35:13] <+Kanbyen> the dwarfs will misplace items, or haul them to the depot and sometimes I'd sell them clicking on the stuff to sell
[2022-12-09 17:35:22] <Lord_Nightmare> i read that and thought "wait, that's a BUG? I thought every sparrow was just a freeloader trying to steal fish"
[2022-12-09 17:35:24] <+Kanbyen> if its missplaced or stolen then its lost and the dwarf might have a mental break
[2022-12-09 17:35:26] <warchild421> Not enough pond turtle shells?
[2022-12-09 17:35:34] <+Kanbyen> selling it will also make the crafter go mad

[2022-12-09 17:36:30] <rudess> i feel like some categories are missing on that panel
[2022-12-09 17:36:33] <+Kanbyen> if you put the artifacts in pedistals the dwarfs get happy thoughts when they see it, if its an instrument for the floor just set it up in the tavern...  it maximizes the number of dwarves seening it

[2022-12-09 17:37:32] <rudess> lmao man sleepin with it
[2022-12-09 17:37:41] <Lord_Nightmare> cutting trees is what separates the smart dwarves from those not destined to survive. its like a dwarven life test
[2022-12-09 17:37:43] <+Kanbyen> @arazaki I haven't tried in this new version but in the previous versions all methods of making the artifact leave the fort caused melt downs
[2022-12-09 17:37:54] <Lord_Nightmare> "you must be at least this smart to cut trees"
[2022-12-09 17:38:03] <keshire> @Cringer can't touch them until they apply for citizenship.
[2022-12-09 17:38:04] <%JadeTigerPlays> you've got two tavern zones?
[2022-12-09 17:38:16] <%+imscomobob> so, those tavern bedrooms are not added correctly - you dont want to expand the tavern zone to include the bedrooms... you want to add each bedroom then go to the 'shield with a +' and add the bedrooms to your tavern location
[2022-12-09 17:38:17] <+Kanbyen> having them stolen is a real thing in the older versions too
[2022-12-09 17:38:24] <Lord_Nightmare> if your dwarf has poor spatial reasoning and cuts down a tree while standing underneath an overhanging branch, they deserve to become a pancake

[2022-12-09 17:43:21] <+Kanbyen> best to build your fortress within 10 map tiles of the other races if you can, you get more merchants
[2022-12-09 17:43:31] <rudess> dwarves can walk on diagonals
[2022-12-09 17:43:35] <rudess> it wont be a problem at all
[2022-12-09 17:43:54] <+Kanbyen> yea its hard to learn honestly the more you learn the more you know you don't know in DF.
[2022-12-09 17:44:05] <rudess> it is like 20 years old tbf

[2022-12-09 17:44:27] <Lord_Nightmare> I heard that the tutorial start has a special feature no later starts have, something to do with getting item values without an appraiser? Is that actually true?

[2022-12-09 17:45:51] <%Arazaki> @rudess think of it in terms of number of straight lines, -, +, triple lines, four lines, circle with line rays is masterwork
[2022-12-09 17:46:03] <%+imscomobob> @Lord_Nightmare i believe that is true
[2022-12-09 17:46:13] <+Kanbyen> you will see what the quality is as your crafter goes up

[2022-12-09 17:47:13] <rudess> yep the wiki page is exactly what i needed :)

[2022-12-09 17:49:52] <rudess> @mmojunkie89 i tried picking every type of wood i had evenly and the rats just made rows of the same color instead of making it random lol
[2022-12-09 17:49:56] <+mmojunkie89> I think that your dwarves pray at them as well

[2022-12-09 17:51:56] <%+imscomobob> Metal is not like minecraft... you dont "find iron" then "smelt iron" - you fine ores that contain iron like Magnetite - and smelt that to get iron

[2022-12-09 17:56:20] <+blazinmonkey> they are needed for higher tier* metal
[2022-12-09 17:56:22] <rudess> not sure, tbf it was my fault i setup a farming plot then never picked the actual thing to plant so we ran outta drink for a while and i never noticed
[2022-12-09 17:56:25] <+Jtwalton> They just don't need fuel
[2022-12-09 17:56:30] <rudess> so one dwarf went crazy and knocked all its teeth out

[2022-12-09 17:56:45] <Durin01> yeah thats how magma forges work
[2022-12-09 17:56:45] <%+imscomobob> gotta learn how to manipulate lava... thats end game strats

[2022-12-09 17:56:47] <+Kanbyen> magma is interesting if you bring it up from below you can get critters in it coming into your fourt
[2022-12-09 17:56:47] <Durin01> you have to dig down to the magma level first though

[2022-12-09 17:56:58] <+Kanbyen> volcano's provide magma at the surface
[2022-12-09 17:57:08] <rudess> dude i tried to setup a well near a honey badgers dead blood and the rats filled my well with a bunch of blood

[2022-12-09 17:57:36] <+blazinmonkey> a secondary one on top of the default one -
[2022-12-09 17:57:45] <+Kanbyen> most folks pump it once the cistern below is full enough you don't need to pump more of it
[2022-12-09 17:57:53] <+blazinmonkey> leave the default one on everyone - make another one for dedicated
[2022-12-09 17:58:03] <rudess> have they actually joined you?
[2022-12-09 17:58:10] <%JohnDoeRadio> @Cringer they are saying they have to be citizens and they will ask in like 2 years
[2022-12-09 17:58:13] <Tpocket> can you show us where you see the others?
[2022-12-09 17:58:15] <keshire> @Cringer those residents will eventually petition for permanent citizenship after a couple of years.
[2022-12-09 17:58:16] <%JalleoBeta> Residents are not citizens
[2022-12-09 17:58:23] <Durin01> children dont work

[2022-12-09 17:58:49] <%Arazaki> children do chores, mostly hauling
[2022-12-09 17:58:52] <%+imscomobob> kids are pointless, push them into the lava
[2022-12-09 17:58:58] <+Kanbyen> @children can't do some things, tavern goes do not include members, and some recruits from tavern can't do some things
[2022-12-09 17:58:59] <Durin01> permanent guests dont work either, they have to request citizenship first
[2022-12-09 17:59:11] <+blazinmonkey> when do dwarves become adults? ... like ... 10 right?
[2022-12-09 17:59:21] <%+imscomobob> children mostly just play make believe... most children do not have good work ethic...
[2022-12-09 17:59:23] <%JohnDoeRadio> that barrack area is the only spot though cringe
[2022-12-09 17:59:26] <Tpocket> There are two levels of things that happen in petitions. Petitions to stay which just means they want to visit for longer, and petitions for citizenship which means they want to join you
[2022-12-09 17:59:27] <+Kanbyen> your tavern citizens ussually end up being bards and soldiers
[2022-12-09 17:59:27] <+Hunta200121> do dwarven children clean their rooms?
[2022-12-09 17:59:29] <%JalleoBeta> Their children they dont do a lot of chores just like all kids
[2022-12-09 17:59:33] <%JohnDoeRadio> might be cause they are off limits there?
[2022-12-09 17:59:35] <healbotfh> the children are too busy being drunk
[2022-12-09 17:59:35] <+Hunta200121> cause human children dont

[2022-12-09 17:59:39] <+Helix26> What is a Messenger role?
[2022-12-09 17:59:53] <Sax850> he did get a human elite crossbowman who wanted to become a citizen
[2022-12-09 17:59:53] <%JalleoBeta> Yes
[2022-12-09 17:59:54] <Durin01> normally permanent residents will requests citizenship after 2-3 years if they have good mood
[2022-12-09 18:00:01] <%$k_nord> correct
[2022-12-09 18:00:03] <Sax850> so they should be available to add to a military squad
[2022-12-09 18:00:11] <Tpocket> you allowed in a bunch of filthy freeloaders
[2022-12-09 18:00:13] <%+imscomobob> LOSING IS FUN
[2022-12-09 18:00:15] <+Kanbyen> children can have moods though, and make things, this gives a huge crafting bump

[2022-12-09 18:02:55] <rudess> its like whats the point
[2022-12-09 18:03:06] <Sax850> Basically, when they make a petition to be a citizen or permanent resident they act as any other dwarf of yours. Before that they only either do like bard stuff or whatever you hired them for, if its "Soldiering" you can put them in a squad.
[2022-12-09 18:03:08] <%+FataltheBaptist> is there booze in the dorms?
[2022-12-09 18:03:22] <+Kanbyen> did you know dwarves like waterfalls? they also like to clean themselves in them, try building them in your taverns for happy thoughts
[2022-12-09 18:03:25] <%+FataltheBaptist> make the tavern a dorm too
[2022-12-09 18:03:30] <Durin01> why do you need 40 slabs?

[2022-12-09 18:08:35] <%Arazaki> i had an 18 year old become an adult, so its changed
[2022-12-09 18:08:38] <+Kanbyen> I have never had a dwarf die of old age, the fort ussually gets wrecked long before getting to 150.
