[2022-12-28 16:20:33] <%Mackapoot> The more regulation, the better. When you have certified edibles, its a way different experience.

[2022-12-28 16:21:09] <!%Kaladas_> I wish we had free market stuff around here. Booze and Pot are sold from Goverment stores and they control the market
[2022-12-28 16:21:10] <cachitblues> I'm telling that people tend to say weed is really bad because it introduces consumers to harder drugs. Which I totally disagree.
[2022-12-28 16:21:14] <%Mackapoot> The only issue with Canadas legalization that I dont like is the 10mg edible limit.
[2022-12-28 16:21:31] <%$jesustoner> Canada and California are stupid for that limit
[2022-12-28 16:21:32] <cachitblues> I'm not chatting anymore, my english is really really bad today XD
[2022-12-28 16:21:34] <%+Jon_Bams_Left_Ball> I wanna know if my weed is farm to table
[2022-12-28 16:21:37] <%ChiefShake> a good amount I get in my area at least, is locally grown, but I also don't live far from the Emerald Triangle
[2022-12-28 16:21:51] <!%BornNaked2> Ahh yeah, I loved what I got out of the amry experience @Goode_Cheeseburgers I was only in the "recruit" part for 3 months, but I got to know myself, and the others in a totally different way.
[2022-12-28 16:21:51] <%Thedarkvet53> @JonBams so the cartels are going to have to change their buisness plan away from weed
[2022-12-28 16:21:51] <%+cmndrzander> Some of the dispensaries print a label with your name on it
[2022-12-28 16:21:58] <+notdevan> Some people’s tolerance is different
[2022-12-28 16:21:58] <!%BornNaked2> army*
[2022-12-28 16:22:01] <!%erebus56> it shows that they want you to have to buy more so they collect more taxes on it
[2022-12-28 16:22:02] <%iamtehnub> not a gate way drug but you do chase that high afterwards am i wrong or am i wrong?
[2022-12-28 16:22:03] <%$Goode_Cheeseburgers> Im no crackhead chat. but one time i brought crack one a one off and this crackhead guy who was getting it for me started turning crack zombie on the way... Had to put him back down to earth

[2022-12-28 16:25:25] <%$TheExecuter1> @jonbams I did buy 1000mg of THC pills that were 50 mg each. so you get 20 pills for $60

[2022-12-28 16:25:37] <+notdevan> Idk how people can do more than like 20mg of edibles

[2022-12-28 16:26:42] <%$jesustoner> “Getting high” is a entourage effect of hundreds of unknown medicines being processed by your body; and I can’t educate you but YouTube is a start; there are many medical conditions people need a “high” to function ; pain; end of life care; cancers, mental disorders, chrons , other illnesses where no other treatment exists.  I never met a patient trying to just get high; IMO

[2022-12-28 16:27:20] <!%Kaladas_> @notdevan if you are eating it, it was probably what it was mixed with, not the THC. Especially if it came from a black market source. I assume it was gummies?

[2022-12-28 16:29:10] <%NightWolf070> Are you able to buy larger amounts on the legal market if you buy the buds? Can buy those and bake your own edibles?

[2022-12-28 16:29:23] <+gobk1n> @NightWolf070 i do this
[2022-12-28 16:29:26] <+xBuckeyex> The only reason the gov't wants to legalize any of this is tax dollars LUL
[2022-12-28 16:29:27] <o1avz> And I was thinking talking about money was werid
[2022-12-28 16:29:31] <%jazzagecabbage> Ive only been able to buy an ounce of flower at a time per dispo. If i buy edibles, no matter the millagrams, it counts as an 1/8th towards my purchase. So i am allowed to buy 8 total edibles at a time or an ounce of flower. The two amounts are not close to being the same amount of "weed"
[2022-12-28 16:29:35] <%+jerrythomas55> TOO DRUGICAL
[2022-12-28 16:29:43] <!%BornNaked2> LUL @erebus56 Yeah bamW I cant...
[2022-12-28 16:29:44] <+gobk1n> you can get 14 gram shake for like 50 bucks which is still a lot compared to other states but its great for cooking

[2022-12-28 16:29:55] <%$jesustoner> @xmyselfxmex hey as a licensed cannabis agent I just wanna call out that RSO has chlorophyll and other things probably making your edibles taste bad; just know you could probably microdose that rso more effectively than converting it to butter or whatever
[2022-12-28 16:30:02] <%+bobbylegos> Colorado and Illinois have nice limits on everything
[2022-12-28 16:30:03] <%$TheExecuter1> we are capped off at 8 grams of concentrate a day
[2022-12-28 16:30:03] <%FSIT> the grey market has led to a few shops by me selling Delta-8 and trying to pass it off as weed by calling it cannabinoid

Disney is fortunate to have the most devoted and enthusiastic fans, and I was reminded of this a few weeks ago when I visited Disneyland Resort and attended the Candlelight Processional. It was invigorating to be surrounded by so many guests who make what we do possible.
[2022-12-28 16:45:08] <!%erebus56> hahahah rodimus is so mad
[2022-12-28 16:45:10] <%Denbrew> We love your passion for our company and your enthusiasm for what we create, and we will continue to do our best to exceed your highest expectations.

[2022-12-28 16:53:33] <%Krat_Arona> Oh sure, I agree with you. But these sleeze balls don't care if they're doing something illegal or not.

[2022-12-28 16:53:56] <%$jesustoner> Like most of the enforcement powers don’t exist they can only refer matters vs self prosecute like EPA can’t fine, FCC couldn’t do shit for a while; it’s finally getting fixed, but putting unqualified people in positions prevented a ton of things

[2022-12-28 17:28:53] <%SamTheCellist> Cheer200 so remember how I was saying on Davie last night that my edibles put me on Pluto? Well I slept until 10am this morning and I walk downstairs and my brothers and parents are just chilling in the living room. My mom says “oh, you slept in? Must have been the brownies”. And then it turned into a laughing joke but I guess my reaction was a poker tell, and now my mom is super suspicious. Being the tiger mom she is, I think I’m going to be watched very closely for the remainder of the week.

[2022-12-28 18:09:45] <$vincesola> Cheer200 And it's almost humorous how people think a multi billion dollar company, with partners in wall street, finance, and other areas, wouldn't anticipate both a recession as well as a bad film slate in 2023. The fact is, we have been having meetings about the recession that is coming before that pandemic was over. While everyone was furloughed we were having conference calls prepping for the recession that would come after we all came back.

[2022-12-28 18:14:08] <%+Enforcer__> maybe not mention Smith by name but start out with "Thank you for showing up for my Netflix Special - the last time i was on stage, it was a big jar'ring but im back!"
[2022-12-28 18:14:10] <$PSIBouncer> He starred on Fargo

[2022-12-28 18:14:14] <%$Reloval> If he is really still mad about it, i think not bringing it up at all is the ultimate indicator of that.
[2022-12-28 18:14:20] <%+SoCalGuy1320> It's a smart move not bringing up Will Smith. Keeps the people guessing and buying tickets. Hoping he does bring it up.

[2022-12-28 18:14:58] <%sizzarow> @jonbams if it was any other type of entertainment other than comedy than i would say he would ignore it and pretend it wasnt a topic to talk about. It being stand up … its a MUST that he beings it up

[2022-12-28 18:20:48] <%$I_Am_Panta> Dane Cook wasnt as bad as Carlos Mensteala
[2022-12-28 18:20:54] <%Mevad_> The industry hate came from "old school" comedians that didn't like storytelling jokes.  You are supposed to set up a joke and then give a punchline.  Dane Cook does not do that @JonBams
[2022-12-28 18:20:57] <%Moldy_Cheese> ewwwww
[2022-12-28 18:20:58] <+Erumite> Speculation:  The hate was fabricated by the industry *because* he was doing it all himself and agents weren't getting their piece of the pie.

[2022-12-28 18:21:12] <%+dam2k05> theres a culture of you need to struggle for YEARS in comedy. He was pretty over night success-y and thus everyone hated him.

[2022-12-28 18:21:38] <!%$DeePick> of course it is
[2022-12-28 18:21:44] <%thatTune> The industry hate came from him trying to fuck other comedians over. There is a story with the laugh factory where other comedians were told it was dane cooks night and to do a short set. Dave Chappelle went up, did 10 minutes and then told everyone he was going outside to smoke a cig and take pictures, etc. From what I heard most of the audience went outside with Dave.
[2022-12-28 18:22:05] <+Face_32> its kinda like music, there are only so many different ways you can put together words/beats to be unique
[2022-12-28 18:22:16] <latishPlahish> wasn't Mencia proven to be a joke stealer?
[2022-12-28 18:22:24] <%$robocahp> If he was stealing Louis ck’s jokes, his material would have been funny!

[2022-12-28 18:30:23] <%Moldy_Cheese> I think Fallon in real life is way different than on tv. He comes to Fairport to a bar his friend from NYC owns and sings there often.
[2022-12-28 18:30:27] <$grysongrange> Jimmy Kimmel seems cool IMO
[2022-12-28 18:30:28] <+TimbTV> The obvious politicization of everything because you're hosting a show is what ruins most of these late night shows for me
[2022-12-28 18:30:33] <%$Gharra6> ive heard he's cool

[2022-12-28 18:44:34] <%$sarosa25> Cheer245 chat help I’m fuming mad. A close friend of mine recently broke up with his girlfriend. This girl was awful to me. She would talk behind my back to my close friends about me because she was insecure about my friendship with her then boyfriend. Now that they’re broken up, one of my friends still invited her out to a weekly bar get together we go to. And when I told this other friend that I wasn’t comfortable with that and why, he said he didn’t want to get involved. Help

[2022-12-28 19:17:20] <%+RancidRalph> its stupid that its illegal. The government should be paying for solar panels and batteries for homes and rainwater collection systems. Philly had a rainwater collecting program
[2022-12-28 19:17:22] <+Face_32> its about the downstream effects of collecting said water
