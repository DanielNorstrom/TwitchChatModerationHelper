[2022-12-08 15:22:55] <nchester51> i remember hwen this use to be a genji stream :(
[2022-12-08 15:23:00] <+spiral_ez_jojo> do you think genji should have a buff
[2022-12-08 15:23:06] <sheepers575> no
[2022-12-08 15:23:11] <sheepers575> he balanced
[2022-12-08 15:23:12] <nchester51> genji needs his dmg back
[2022-12-08 15:23:15] <nchester51> so useless

[2022-12-08 15:23:38] <nchester51> its gonna kill game like goats
[2022-12-08 15:23:51] <nchester51> gold is probably too nice more like sivler
[2022-12-08 15:23:52] <badtks> @nchester51 ??? genji is so much harder to aim with than people like mcree soldier and sojourn xD
[2022-12-08 15:23:52] <+llldomelll> i wish i had 2 healers on my ass because i was a streamer

[2022-12-08 17:38:49] <+crazysin96> @donut16378 no no, in fact Pharah can get a lot of kills where she shouldn't be in low elo/quick play, making you learn bad positioning. That's what I meant by random. And by the not translating part I meant that as Pharah you have to lead your shots, which isn't the case with most other heroes

A great multitude of viewers allegedly in audience, and yet nothing of substance is being shown, only useless time wasting in-queue videos in abundance. He is passably interesting, to be certain, but lacking in a viable dps (genji nerf bozo), so 2,456 viewers seems rather suspect. And all of these repeated messages; perhaps automated? These are merely mine own ponderings, no reply is necessary.
