[2022-12-16 07:05:20] <%godot_was_here> your reasoning was that you are what you eat and you wanted to become smart like obama

[2022-12-16 07:06:24] <ABC_itsSpyro123> Obama seemed like they had a good sense of humor, if you could eat them to gain that it is a win.

[2022-12-16 07:30:00] <%NewerDCD> is that he's making an RPG Maker game for his current ongoing manga and it's canon to that manga

[2022-12-16 08:15:34] <%denchi__> ??????
[2022-12-16 08:15:35] <@%KafroHudrep> ok, from smash melee: Seven years after Ganondorf took control of Hyrule, ReDeads roamed the ruins of Castle Town, moaning. At first, Link was shocked at the state of the town, and the apparent lack of survivors. He later learned that the townsfolk had evacuated to safety, and that the ReDeads were just magic animated into hideous humanoid shapes.

[2022-12-16 09:44:52] <Calavera_VT> There's a few censored things in this game
[2022-12-16 09:44:59] <%denchi__> oooh is that what it was...
[2022-12-16 09:45:01] <@%KafroHudrep> they did actually have to reissue copies of ocarina of time because of a later temple using chants
[2022-12-16 09:45:20] <@%KafroHudrep> maybe not reissue just make sure further copies didn't have it or something
[2022-12-16 09:45:44] <SilverWolfX9> i think they made change since they thought they'd be insulting people otherwise
[2022-12-16 09:45:49] <%godot_was_here> later prints used version 1.1 which removed the chanting
[2022-12-16 09:45:50] <%AlphaOmega82> Sorry chants are owned by one group
[2022-12-16 09:46:09] <SilverWolfX9> the fire temple used Muslim chants.
[2022-12-16 09:46:15] <Calavera_VT> you climb
[2022-12-16 09:46:20] <c0ugar> i don't know that anyone actually complained, i think they just did it preemptively to avoid any potential controversy
[2022-12-16 09:46:28] <@%KafroHudrep> yeah it was an islamic prayer chant sampled from a third party library
[2022-12-16 09:46:33] <socialistOtter> mouse

[2022-12-16 09:46:53] <StraySineWave> Not sure fictional cult games are on the same par as using chants from a real life religion as atmosphere noise
[2022-12-16 09:46:56] <@%KafroHudrep> like Earthbound had a lot of censorship
[2022-12-16 09:46:56] <socialistOtter> tobsHAPPY
[2022-12-16 09:47:07] <Calavera_VT> thats why you had to grow 7 years, the ledges were too high

[2022-12-16 09:47:57] <@%KafroHudrep> as a manlet i think there is plenty wrong with it

[2022-12-16 09:48:53] <SilverWolfX9> height is important when it comes to attraction tho.

[2022-12-16 09:49:19] <Calavera_VT> The epitome of shallowness
[2022-12-16 09:49:36] <Gerwich> No such thing
[2022-12-16 09:49:36] <@%KafroHudrep> i honestly liked being a bit shorter because when i was a kid i liked to imagine exploring my legos at lego size
[2022-12-16 09:49:43] <PrussianBot_> "You are one inch too short, I can't do it"
[2022-12-16 09:49:56] <socialistOtter> okay but if she's 9 feet tall that's rough. it's not a dealbreaker but it's a difficulty
[2022-12-16 09:49:57] <%AlphaOmega82> you say that but lots of people seem to have height preferences
[2022-12-16 09:49:59] <Calavera_VT> your elbows are too pointy, sorry
