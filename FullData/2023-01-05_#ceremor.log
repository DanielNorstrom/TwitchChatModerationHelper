[2023-01-05 03:18:45] <@%+skizem_> Well, that's not true. I think the StalkerZ map costs money to use or something.

[2023-01-05 03:25:06] <+lew284> Dayz 2 just around the corner like Arma 4………
[2023-01-05 03:25:06] <josie_posie_> dying light 1 was a great parkour game. lets not talk about dying light 2

[2023-01-05 03:25:28] <TheFro420> was playing RDR2 the other day and thinking how cool it would be to have a western style dayZ game. and also how awesome it would be if dayZ looked as good as RDR2
[2023-01-05 03:25:30] <@%+skizem_> You didn't get paid to play 1, that's all I know
[2023-01-05 03:25:33] <SeaGoats> Sui Generis style physics in dayz
[2023-01-05 03:25:43] <HiddenStones_z> All Ubisoft game feel so empty
[2023-01-05 03:25:47] <@%+skizem_> There's a medieval style zombie game coming, but no western
[2023-01-05 03:25:52] <%Dreams_Of_Cheese> dying lights first quest has you looking for guys selling fake zombie drugs and instead of dwelling on that interesting conflict you kill them with hammers
[2023-01-05 03:26:09] <@%+skizem_> There's FiveM modded for RDR2
[2023-01-05 03:26:12] <Fire_Hoff> nopixel runs an rdr2 server
[2023-01-05 03:26:15] <jakeontop_> One thing I appreciate about dayz is the graphics the scenery’s do look really nice
[2023-01-05 03:26:18] <threetooths> @josie_posie_ i tried 7 dayz to die and got frustrated
[2023-01-05 03:26:18] <+just_call_me_proddy> There was a bridge bit in the original, that made my testicles retract. Never had another game do that
[2023-01-05 03:26:18] <actual_bass_player> i mean ubisoft made assassins creed 2
[2023-01-05 03:26:19] <josie_posie_> nightime isnt scary in dl2, no guns in dl2, no pvp in dl2, somehow a worse story in dl2

[2023-01-05 09:11:37] <Hajas87> oh maybe the shock from the gascan overwrites the hit shock

[2023-01-05 09:12:19] <%TunnelSnakes_RuIe> i can explain
[2023-01-05 09:12:23] <%TunnelSnakes_RuIe> give me a sec
[2023-01-05 09:12:25] <Hajas87> @Ceremor that means you add one hit and the second hit gets overwritten too
[2023-01-05 09:12:26] <+dreamscapes> Your the master of DayZ exploits
[2023-01-05 09:12:33] <Hajas87> still more shock on them
[2023-01-05 09:12:38] <%$perpendickulars> is there any difference in damage to the gas canister in a power attack vs light attack?
[2023-01-05 09:12:43] <%Danglostmykeysagain> @just_call_me_proddy Thanks for the gift sub!
[2023-01-05 09:12:52] [Notification] im_download subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! [Thank you sir, I'll let you know how it works out for me]
[2023-01-05 09:13:00] <%TunnelSnakes_RuIe> so the way the gas canister works is it does just over 60 max shock dmg which itself isn't enough to KO but when you punch someone with it you also get 15 shock dmg for the punch which combined is just enough to KO someone, the puncher also gets KOed so it must have some condition where if it explodes on your person it's automatically a KO
[2023-01-05 09:13:06] <+jonrambo416> more shock more sleep its not rocket science
[2023-01-05 09:13:12] <drewwand> u hit the penjamin?!

[2023-01-05 09:14:34] <$ZlPLO> id like to see the science where you walk straight up behind someone and punch them without taking any damage yourself

[2023-01-05 09:15:08] <LTJawsh> Does having less stamina make you more vulnerable to shock damage?

[2023-01-05 09:15:19] <$UncleFly_> Wobo math
[2023-01-05 09:15:21] <MrRipTV> so u can definitely get shock over 75?

[2023-01-05 09:25:02] <BurberryBloodstains> @jonrambo416 it was summits friend Hutch that owned the servers I think
[2023-01-05 09:25:05] <%+just_call_me_proddy> Do a sex tape with Shroud. That'll get you the fame you deserve
[2023-01-05 09:25:11] <BurberryBloodstains> They died out instantly
[2023-01-05 09:25:13] <@%+Chaosshield> shroud literally streamed to like 10 people tops before he was streamsniping summit
[2023-01-05 09:25:15] <+scalpsaurus> sad 1 gram deleted everything today lol, i enjoy watching him play tarky
[2023-01-05 09:25:24] <%RaggedFlag> @Ceremor Do you think DayZ will eventually die in the near future? Or is here to stay like say Age of Empires II?
[2023-01-05 09:25:28] <%+The_Venom_Inside> I found smoke from summit back then
[2023-01-05 09:25:30] <BurberryBloodstains> @chaosshield was that in DayZ or PubG?

[2023-01-05 09:26:37] <gisnet6> sad times if there is no other 'dayz' game by then

[2023-01-05 09:27:06] <BurberryBloodstains> @meemzeh it’s going to be insanely moddable is the only reason I say that
[2023-01-05 09:27:09] <cpmilans_> stop mentioning all the games that gave me great hope only to take it away
[2023-01-05 09:27:11] <Meemzeh> Rust tried to compete but that game is just dull LUL

[2023-01-05 09:27:23] <%+The_Venom_Inside> sec lemme look when i get on the pc
[2023-01-05 09:27:28] <%namorsei> Rust is a whole other beast
[2023-01-05 09:27:34] <%Psychoactivehaze> honestly I think the only thing dayz lacks that I would want is truely massive maps, like 5-10x the size of cherno, with population to match
[2023-01-05 09:27:34] <TacomaTrev> new rust recoil is weird
[2023-01-05 09:27:42] <%Psychoactivehaze> technically daunting
[2023-01-05 09:27:42] <%seankeez> Will drenched food rebuff you like freezing?
[2023-01-05 09:27:43] <@%+Chaosshield> I love the new rust recoil
[2023-01-05 09:27:46] <@%+Chaosshield> god bless
[2023-01-05 09:27:46] <brainfuggler> old rust was so fun
[2023-01-05 09:27:48] <%+prissy_pdx> dark n darker if they add voip
[2023-01-05 09:27:49] <brainfuggler> like super old
[2023-01-05 09:27:51] <@%+Chaosshield> fuck the spray patterns
[2023-01-05 09:27:55] <Meemzeh> Loot, survive and interact.
[2023-01-05 09:27:55] <@%+Chaosshield> yeah, its random now
[2023-01-05 09:28:00] <@%+Chaosshield> instead of the spray patterns
[2023-01-05 09:28:02] <TacomaTrev> takes away all skill
[2023-01-05 09:28:03] <drewwand> hopefully the day before will be goated

[2023-01-05 09:28:08] <%namorsei> the spray patterns were hella dumb
[2023-01-05 09:28:13] <%namorsei> people cheesed them so hard
[2023-01-05 09:28:13] <violenthipy> I love watching you play dayz, but I also was really digging the dark and darker play
[2023-01-05 09:28:14] <senri40k> Loving the history lesson <3
[2023-01-05 09:28:25] <BurberryBloodstains> The new recoil is actually good for the game. Scripting isn’t as bad now
[2023-01-05 09:28:37] <draaxleague> Yhea dark and darker ware awesome
[2023-01-05 09:28:37] <%+just_call_me_proddy> Once Arma 4 gets released it will siphon players of to new mods
[2023-01-05 09:28:42] <%namorsei> isn't as bad but definitely still prevalent
[2023-01-05 09:28:47] <+chef_skill> @TacomaTrev i also from tac town
[2023-01-05 09:28:47] <BurberryBloodstains> Literally everyone who didn’t have 15K hours in rust was scripting. Games actually playable now
[2023-01-05 09:28:50] <TacomaTrev> @Chaosshield at the cost of legit players paying the price tho
[2023-01-05 09:29:00] <TacomaTrev> @chef_skill im not LOL
[2023-01-05 09:29:01] <$jeir35> how does MF survival fit into the dayz storyline?
[2023-01-05 09:29:07] <@%+Chaosshield> the legit players still are better aimers and better at controlling normal recoil
[2023-01-05 09:29:13] <+chef_skill> @TacomaTrev oh toyota huh?
[2023-01-05 09:29:27] <TacomaTrev> @chef_skill yessir LUL
[2023-01-05 09:29:27] <%lonewolf199469> @Ceremor any tips for someone who is entirely new to namalsk
[2023-01-05 09:29:28] <@%+Chaosshield> the spray patterns were bad for the game, there was no anticheat that worked for the macro users
[2023-01-05 09:29:47] <BurberryBloodstains> Rust is more about positioning now. It did make big groups way stronger with the new recoil update which sucks but that’s why I don’t play official
[2023-01-05 09:29:47] <@%+Chaosshield> I know 2 people that ran rust macros for like 4 years and never caught a ban
[2023-01-05 09:29:51] <@%+Chaosshield> they were completely undetectable
[2023-01-05 09:29:57] <+chef_skill> @TacomaTrev nice
[2023-01-05 09:30:03] <%namorsei> I remember some "legit" players outraged at the spray pattern change it was a great time

[2023-01-05 09:30:27] <BurberryBloodstains> Yeah I’d say the majority of people who hate the new recoil were using macros before the change

[2023-01-05 09:51:32] <+TimKhanG> There are a few countries where Saturday and Sunday are not considered to be the weekend days for leisure and rest. For example, in Iran, the weekend consists of Thursday and Friday, while in Israel the weekend is Friday and Saturday. In many Muslim-majority countries, the weekend is Friday and Saturday, as Friday is the day of congregational prayer in Islam. Some countries, such as India and Nepal, also have regional or cultural variations in the days that are considered to be the weekend.
