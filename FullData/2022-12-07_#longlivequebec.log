[2022-12-07 18:06:32] <+pannumouho> its time for war
[2022-12-07 18:06:41] <%+ScrapyardGhostTrain> No other setting gives you a pipe organ that's also rocket artillery.
[2022-12-07 18:06:44] <Zendalor> i love the force halberd desing. so simple yet so powerfull
[2022-12-07 18:07:36] <aimless_dude> Don’t break down the ship!!

[2022-12-07 18:08:26] <%AlphaPrimaris> Which is… questionable, at best
[2022-12-07 18:08:57] <%AlphaPrimaris> We should get the vortex torps repaired first quebKappa
[2022-12-07 18:09:00] <Dj3msO> Just get some spacetape and WD-40 on it, good as new
[2022-12-07 18:09:13] <%AlphaPrimaris> Some worlds are too far gone to save…

[2022-12-07 18:10:04] <Battokage> @Dj3msO wd-41 please
[2022-12-07 18:10:16] <MonsterShenanigans> @Torgga_Clanless We call those servitors
[2022-12-07 18:10:21] <+SilverNightwing> For anyone not aware, artificial intelligence of any kind is heresy in the imperium of man. Anything more than a corkscrew bottle opener is forbidden. As a result felons are lobotomized, carved and used to do menial tasks
[2022-12-07 18:10:57] <Dj3msO> @Dj3msO Don't mess with tech inherited from Holy Terra, WD-40 worked for millenia! xD
[2022-12-07 18:11:22] <aimless_dude> A minor reminder that becoming “felon” is a very easy mistake to make in the 40k universe
[2022-12-07 18:11:27] <Zendalor> his mouth is flying left and right...
[2022-12-07 18:11:34] <+SilverNightwing> @aimless_dude Oh yes

[2022-12-07 18:12:31] <%AlphaPrimaris> Very nice touch imo
[2022-12-07 18:13:00] <thedrunkdutchman> The art-style and armor look amazing

[2022-12-07 18:13:29] <+pannumouho> mate, everything in the 41st millenia in antiquated
[2022-12-07 18:13:30] <@^Moobot> Remember to read the rules below the stream to avoid a *bonk* from the mods.
[2022-12-07 18:13:52] <aimless_dude> Even in the grim dark future of the 41st millenia, red tape is thick and abundant
[2022-12-07 18:13:54] <%AlphaPrimaris> The Ordo Malleus has GK as their Chamber Militant
[2022-12-07 18:13:56] <mark_hayden> Just joined, but I thought the inquisitor was gone?

[2022-12-07 18:14:10] <%AlphaPrimaris> @mark_hayden is new run
[2022-12-07 18:14:14] <%AlphaPrimaris> New campaign with DLC story
[2022-12-07 18:14:15] <mark_hayden> Ah I see
[2022-12-07 18:14:17] <thedrunkdutchman> Yeah, the Grey Knights in its entirety is the Chamber Militant for the Ordo Malleus of the Inquisition
[2022-12-07 18:14:45] <thedrunkdutchman> But also, yknow, the Grey Knights are awesome
[2022-12-07 18:15:11] <%AlphaPrimaris> Deathwatch is for Ordo Xenos
[2022-12-07 18:15:11] <+pannumouho> ectar is suffering from the flesh change monkaS
[2022-12-07 18:15:13] <%AlphaPrimaris> And I’m not sure if Hereticus has a Militant aside from the SoB…
[2022-12-07 18:15:14] <%$CosmicMettBroetchen> Ectar slept with the Emperors wife
[2022-12-07 18:15:22] <thedrunkdutchman> @AlphaPrimaris I don't think so
[2022-12-07 18:15:30] <MonsterShenanigans> Because they didn't normalize their dialogue levels to be about even
[2022-12-07 18:15:40] <thedrunkdutchman> I think it's just the Sororitas for the Ordo Hereticus?
[2022-12-07 18:15:48] <MonsterShenanigans> audio QoL is easy to be lazy on sometimes
[2022-12-07 18:15:52] <%AlphaPrimaris> Yeah I think so
