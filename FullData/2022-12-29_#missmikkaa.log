[2022-12-29 16:16:32] <@%Radolov> Malenia will be the toughest I think
[2022-12-29 16:16:51] <+VenrirID> Stun her, destroy her poise
[2022-12-29 16:16:58] <+superszybkialex> how many times did u finished this game?
[2022-12-29 16:17:02] <%+BowlofCheesy> are you gonna do dragonlord?

[2022-12-29 16:17:15] <%t0mahawk777> you will make it, you know it and we know it
[2022-12-29 16:17:17] <%Lympy> This is her first playthrough

[2022-12-29 16:17:31] <!%bmap72> something like that
[2022-12-29 16:17:34] <@%Radolov> The hardest thing will be to survive the waterfowl. Rest can be managed.

[2022-12-29 16:18:32] <%+Ender1321> Malenia was disappointing for me as a boss. Everyone said she is so great, but it's only waterfowl and if you avoid that it's easy.
