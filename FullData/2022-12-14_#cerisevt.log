[2022-12-14 11:38:50] <%+phantomsalmon> @phantomsalmon I would assume the Norman conquest of Brittain plays role in that. But there is also bit of nationalism as everybody tries to make the claim that THEY are the ones who invented the word
[2022-12-14 11:38:58] <%+Grinning_Fox> very much the case as the English language adopted thousands of French words after a lengthy period of French occupation. Many of those words have been altered or fully changed, but are still part of the English lexicon
[2022-12-14 11:39:15] <verajonson> i HATE how this game can force bad traits onto your kids

[2022-12-14 12:02:43] <!Aaron_Kessinger> and I'm pretty sure there are some skills in the stewardship lifestyle that can let you own more places, and some techs too but I don't think you should care that much, having vassal is part of the game^^
[2022-12-14 12:02:49] <%$Memil03> Make sure he is the same religion too
[2022-12-14 12:03:05] <!Skarbimir> indeed, 2 more lands in stewardship tree

[2022-12-14 12:03:20] <!Skarbimir> also having more that 2 stewardship would be cool KEKW

[2022-12-14 12:05:27] <!Skarbimir> English merchants used to buy woods from Poland and Polish after being asked "what is this wood?" they answered "Z Prus = from Prussia", "Z Prus" and "Spruce" is pronounced nearly the same KEKW

[2022-12-14 12:32:55] <!Skarbimir> nah, it is rock-paper-scissors sort or more like terrain + counters
[2022-12-14 12:33:03] <verajonson> but you need a GOOD spymaster for that
[2022-12-14 12:33:21] <!Skarbimir> so heavy infantry counters pikemen for instance and loses with light infantry in forests, becvause of terrain
