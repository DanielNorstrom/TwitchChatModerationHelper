And you have a train too, and of course a machinegun on it ! And then you can get a flamethrower, and a rocket launcher, and make your train faster and kaboomer, and then you go in mines to get eggs ! And then you fight the spider train from hell !

[2022-12-20 06:26:36] <Quarthian> I have little faith in the RE4 remake so I'm hoping to be pleasantly surprised
[2022-12-20 06:26:37] <deadite_damien> Did you see how Rockay Crime City was 40% off if you preordered it between the 8th-10th danejeMath
[2022-12-20 06:26:40] <$HowdyMcGee> I'm in the same boat, I'm looking forward to the remake but after watching people run RE4 I kinda realize it's not my thing.
[2022-12-20 06:26:53] <VernardoHunk> RE4 is not a good game if you are not into the genre and more "casual", maybe you should play remake
[2022-12-20 06:27:03] <beingjustahooman> @somethingbarbaric it's EA and they have only one job just remake a already made game
[2022-12-20 06:27:19] <%Abradini> Imma be honest Iâve only played the remakes of the resident evils and the 7th game
[2022-12-20 06:27:25] <%+g1ng3rm1tt3ns> Glad to see this game has runners.

[2022-12-20 06:29:25] <VernardoHunk> probally the most easier to play as in terms of getting into it are the remakes

[2022-12-20 06:50:40] <Sasam> Hey Maxy, goodluck with the runs
[2022-12-20 06:51:12] <%smooferboi> I imagine it's also tied to how long runs are too

[2022-12-20 06:51:37] <!IcyRayne> Callisto is such a boring game to watch and play ResidentSleeper

[2022-12-20 06:51:52] <+LivingLooneyBin> Callisto is really long and has some really ass tricks too

[2022-12-20 06:52:25] <%De_cloud> @beingjustahooman Yessir
[2022-12-20 06:52:26] <Zabasu> is calisto that bad for speedruns?
[2022-12-20 06:52:42] <beingjustahooman> @de_cloud congratulations man
[2022-12-20 06:52:55] <JawshPawshTV> Chillin! Just got home from work, excited to see some new strats for the Pain Train.
[2022-12-20 06:52:56] <+LivingLooneyBin> @Zabasu It has an hour of unskippable cutscenes and a trick right at the start that kills alot of runs
[2022-12-20 06:53:09] <+AnimatedElf> One of the tricks in Callisto is FPS reliant
[2022-12-20 06:53:15] <+AnimatedElf> if I recall right
[2022-12-20 06:53:39] <beingjustahooman> for speed runner unskipable cutscenes are nightmare
[2022-12-20 06:53:41] <%De_cloud> @beingjustahooman Thanks maxyyLove
[2022-12-20 06:53:43] <!IcyRayne> speedrun of it a tad more entertaining but game itself is pretty with no depth
[2022-12-20 06:53:50] <+sharkhat87> I actually haven't seen the rocket launcher strats, makes sense

[2022-12-20 07:19:42] <%+YamaJuugo> Dist also says lower FPS makes the fight easier. Idk if you knew that already

[2022-12-20 07:19:49] <%+Miss_Olivia> there's a new route?
[2022-12-20 07:19:58] <+diggitydingdong> 75fps was the claim

[2022-12-20 07:20:17] <%+YamaJuugo> thats about what I run at and charles fucks me lol
[2022-12-20 07:20:27] <hittaus> maybe charles is getting furious towards his demise, so saving scraps for the final 10 secs might make a difference?

[2022-12-20 09:55:31] <DriverBen> I wonder if they use those wooden whistles that sound like trains in their ceremonies

[2022-12-20 10:53:25] <jack_burtonpce> expectations and hype for Callisto, people tend to have an idea of what they expect and when they don't get that they get angry.  I think with Scorn they didn't really know what to expect.

[2022-12-20 10:54:34] <%Zeph43> I almost think spending a lot on marketing is a bad idea
[2022-12-20 10:55:04] <+Eleslas> Parksy4 : Optimisation made it terribly bad. But except that, it's not bad per se. It's just kind of a "sub-par Dead Space", and people hoped for an "even better Dead Space" imo
[2022-12-20 10:55:06] <super_optimus_sponge> I like them both and I honestly like callisto protocol more

[2022-12-20 10:57:23] <+Snaxel> callisto was like a bit worse version of dead space but I had fun playing it. the "jump scares" were pretty predictable but otherwise it was okay
[2022-12-20 10:57:28] <+Eleslas> Also, I'd say Scorn was mostly targeting an already horor consuming player base. While Callisto aimed at a wider public, so I think it also helps with the whole "bigger backlash" thing

[2022-12-20 11:10:40] <+Eleslas> Cindorian : The time to swap between weapons being longer than the rocket launcher reload time, it would mean losing some rocket dmg. So a bit unlikely I suppose
[2022-12-20 11:11:18] <Cindorian> @Eleslas I see I figured you would have enough time just barely

[2022-12-20 11:11:50] <+SindinLuckstone> thank you that makes things a fair bit easier.
[2022-12-20 11:12:32] <+Eleslas> Cindorian : I suppose even if that's enough time for a short burst, the risk/reward might not be worth it. Cause you would have to be extremely precise with the manipulation at the risk of costing time instead, for a very small reward if done correctly

[2022-12-20 13:22:52] <+diggitydingdong> @YamaJuugo I wouldnt think so since the train moving is the blocker, and its not like the train moves faster post death
[2022-12-20 13:23:15] <orange_d0t> i was curious. Have you ever tried to shot one rocket, change a gun, and again change gun on a rocket launcher? I mean maybe you can reload rockets faster hmmm KEKWait

[2022-12-20 13:23:25] <%+TheSanctusNex> The train will move at X speed regardless of his death time.
[2022-12-20 13:23:27] <Species5618Beta> Less weight on the train should make it go faster

[2022-12-20 14:23:04] <BystanderTim_> Yeah, all the modern RE games run relatively well on deck
[2022-12-20 14:23:33] <%+YamaJuugo> steam deck is 720p right?
[2022-12-20 14:23:42] <BystanderTim_> Yeah, kind of comes with the territory, pretty much anything intensive from like 2018 onward is medium or low
[2022-12-20 14:23:43] <ineed2p_fr> how do u speedrun the game
[2022-12-20 14:23:46] <+MrSamsaZ> depends what you mean by downgrade since if you own a pc with low specs it may be around the same
[2022-12-20 14:23:48] <BystanderTim_> steam deck is 800p
[2022-12-20 14:24:11] <webvi> its just the sacrifice you make to have it handheld

[2022-12-20 14:52:51] <%+Marrickfait> Reminds me of the first TLoU2 run lol
[2022-12-20 14:52:51] <boomcrafter123> @boomcrafter123 cool
[2022-12-20 14:53:17] <Varinathras> how much of the time was cutscenes?
[2022-12-20 14:53:19] <+PrimeDarkseid> just like outlast 2 don't have cutscene skip
[2022-12-20 14:53:24] <bogdan319> now it is just 12.5 ez
[2022-12-20 14:53:25] <Dallou> Thats like people who do FF speedruns. 5 hours into a run and it dies monkaS
[2022-12-20 14:53:27] <Quarthian> Could be pokemon and have a cutscene skip that skips like 2 things
[2022-12-20 14:53:32] <%Silverwolf32> You will see our work, even if you don't want to LUL
[2022-12-20 14:53:37] <freegil> isn't it like half the game's length?
[2022-12-20 14:53:40] <+woodmaster437> choo choo Charles seems to be a fun Speedrun game especially for a indie game
[2022-12-20 14:53:41] <%+Marrickfait> When they implement Cutscene Skip, does that mean the 2 hour Ironwood part will be skippable LUL
[2022-12-20 14:53:52] <+volkin_rose> i fell like any speed run over 10 hours are brutal
[2022-12-20 14:54:05] <%PrimaIvoid> A lot of time, money, and work goes into them. That being said, after the first playthrough, they should 100% be skippable
[2022-12-20 14:54:15] <boomcrafter123> i mean imagining spending days on cutsens just to know that ist gonna get skipt every time
[2022-12-20 14:54:27] <%Silverwolf32> I mean MGS4 had cutscene skips, and we know how much of that game is cutscenes LUL
[2022-12-20 14:54:28] <+PrimeDarkseid> imagine if MGS cutscene or death stranding cutscenes was unskippable.
[2022-12-20 14:54:42] VIEWERS: 1Â 097
[2022-12-20 14:54:55] <Varinathras> they would probably implement a rewatch cutscene feature in GOW (if there isn't) before a skip option

[2022-12-20 14:56:44] <Varinathras> i mean because of people having gotten called and pulling their children out of the laundromat and missing a cutscene and not wanting to replay the game from scratch due to missing some plot point or cool animation
[2022-12-20 14:56:49] <+tommy13_37> is it possible to let the train drive, and you jump off?

[2022-12-20 15:12:04] <%+TheSanctusNex> Just pull a Dr Who and retroactively have the stuff you need already?
[2022-12-20 15:12:10] <@%H1pp0__> ye

[2022-12-20 15:13:07] <Quarthian> So you don't boost damage any more?
[2022-12-20 15:13:15] <huomentailtaapaivaa> the red keycard skip is annoiyng
[2022-12-20 15:13:20] <huomentailtaapaivaa> in the main game
[2022-12-20 15:13:29] <SpudoodIes> Charles is coming? The king of England? Here?
[2022-12-20 15:13:53] <huomentailtaapaivaa> i dont know how to do the lantern skip
[2022-12-20 15:14:39] <unknownabysss> madhouse is really unforgiving
[2022-12-20 15:14:44] <Quarthian> I feel like the trick to speedrunning is it ignore WR's and just work on PB'ing
[2022-12-20 15:14:46] <sixerswas> What's your pb?
[2022-12-20 15:14:48] <%Silverwolf32> to each his/her own I say

[2022-12-20 15:17:27] <+woodmaster437> distortion2 sit at the fence so the door bomb won't throw him and he has a headstart  inside
[2022-12-20 15:17:37] <scoobymcdooby5> @huomentailtaapaivaa Lmao I struggled bad with that what an intro to the game
[2022-12-20 15:18:02] <+Immersxd> Does the game only last around 20 min?
