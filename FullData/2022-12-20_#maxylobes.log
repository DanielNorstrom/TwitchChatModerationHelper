And you have a train too, and of course a machinegun on it ! And then you can get a flamethrower, and a rocket launcher, and make your train faster and kaboomer, and then you go in mines to get eggs ! And then you fight the spider train from hell !

[2022-12-20 06:26:36] <Quarthian> I have little faith in the RE4 remake so I'm hoping to be pleasantly surprised
[2022-12-20 06:26:37] <deadite_damien> Did you see how Rockay Crime City was 40% off if you preordered it between the 8th-10th danejeMath
[2022-12-20 06:26:40] <$HowdyMcGee> I'm in the same boat, I'm looking forward to the remake but after watching people run RE4 I kinda realize it's not my thing.
[2022-12-20 06:26:53] <VernardoHunk> RE4 is not a good game if you are not into the genre and more "casual", maybe you should play remake
[2022-12-20 06:27:03] <beingjustahooman> @somethingbarbaric it's EA and they have only one job just remake a already made game
[2022-12-20 06:27:19] <%Abradini> Imma be honest I’ve only played the remakes of the resident evils and the 7th game
[2022-12-20 06:27:25] <%+g1ng3rm1tt3ns> Glad to see this game has runners.
[2022-12-20 06:27:42] <Quarthian> @VernardoHunk Disagree, I hate survival horror games and loved RE4

[2022-12-20 06:29:25] <VernardoHunk> probally the most easier to play as in terms of getting into it are the remakes

[2022-12-20 06:52:19] <lastinout> have you play Endoparasitic?
[2022-12-20 06:52:24] <cmd67082> HeyGuys
[2022-12-20 06:52:25] <%De_cloud> @beingjustahooman Yessir
[2022-12-20 06:52:26] <Zabasu> is calisto that bad for speedruns?
[2022-12-20 06:52:42] <beingjustahooman> @de_cloud congratulations man
[2022-12-20 06:52:55] <JawshPawshTV> Chillin! Just got home from work, excited to see some new strats for the Pain Train.
[2022-12-20 06:52:56] <+LivingLooneyBin> @Zabasu It has an hour of unskippable cutscenes and a trick right at the start that kills alot of runs
[2022-12-20 06:53:09] <+AnimatedElf> One of the tricks in Callisto is FPS reliant
[2022-12-20 06:53:15] <+AnimatedElf> if I recall right
[2022-12-20 06:53:39] <beingjustahooman> for speed runner unskipable cutscenes are nightmare
[2022-12-20 06:53:41] <%De_cloud> @beingjustahooman Thanks maxyyLove
[2022-12-20 06:53:43] <!IcyRayne> speedrun of it a tad more entertaining but game itself is pretty with no depth
[2022-12-20 06:53:50] <+sharkhat87> I actually haven't seen the rocket launcher strats, makes sense
[2022-12-20 06:54:03] <beingjustahooman> @de_cloud boy or a girl
[2022-12-20 06:54:04] <exitmusick909> this game feels like something i played in a arcade once

[2022-12-20 07:07:04] <dinmammaeenpappa> @Silverwolf32 i mean all bad games are better as speedruns because they are faster so less time spent in bad

[2022-12-20 10:53:25] <jack_burtonpce> expectations and hype for Callisto, people tend to have an idea of what they expect and when they don't get that they get angry.  I think with Scorn they didn't really know what to expect.

[2022-12-20 10:54:34] <%Zeph43> I almost think spending a lot on marketing is a bad idea
[2022-12-20 10:55:04] <+Eleslas> Parksy4 : Optimisation made it terribly bad. But except that, it's not bad per se. It's just kind of a "sub-par Dead Space", and people hoped for an "even better Dead Space" imo
[2022-12-20 10:55:06] <super_optimus_sponge> I like them both and I honestly like callisto protocol more

[2022-12-20 10:57:23] <+Snaxel> callisto was like a bit worse version of dead space but I had fun playing it. the "jump scares" were pretty predictable but otherwise it was okay
[2022-12-20 10:57:28] <+Eleslas> Also, I'd say Scorn was mostly targeting an already horor consuming player base. While Callisto aimed at a wider public, so I think it also helps with the whole "bigger backlash" thing

[2022-12-20 11:10:40] <+Eleslas> Cindorian : The time to swap between weapons being longer than the rocket launcher reload time, it would mean losing some rocket dmg. So a bit unlikely I suppose
[2022-12-20 11:11:18] <Cindorian> @Eleslas I see I figured you would have enough time just barely

[2022-12-20 11:12:32] <+Eleslas> Cindorian : I suppose even if that's enough time for a short burst, the risk/reward might not be worth it. Cause you would have to be extremely precise with the manipulation at the risk of costing time instead, for a very small reward if done correctly
[2022-12-20 11:12:33] <+BoredAussieGaming> Move to Australia and maxy streams prime time

[2022-12-20 13:22:52] <+diggitydingdong> @YamaJuugo I wouldnt think so since the train moving is the blocker, and its not like the train moves faster post death
[2022-12-20 13:23:15] <orange_d0t> i was curious. Have you ever tried to shot one rocket, change a gun, and again change gun on a rocket launcher? I mean maybe you can reload rockets faster hmmm KEKWait
[2022-12-20 13:23:20] <kbz015> Wats wr ?
[2022-12-20 13:23:25] <%+TheSanctusNex> The train will move at X speed regardless of his death time.
[2022-12-20 13:23:27] <Species5618Beta> Less weight on the train should make it go faster

[2022-12-20 13:23:53] <%+YamaJuugo> @diggitydingdong that makes sense. and honestly given the fact I don't notice a difference actually probably agrees with that

[2022-12-20 14:22:42] <+MrSamsaZ> I have played re2 remake on my steamdeck on med settings and it holds around 60 well
[2022-12-20 14:23:04] <BystanderTim_> Yeah, all the modern RE games run relatively well on deck
[2022-12-20 14:23:33] <%+YamaJuugo> steam deck is 720p right?
[2022-12-20 14:23:42] <BystanderTim_> Yeah, kind of comes with the territory, pretty much anything intensive from like 2018 onward is medium or low
[2022-12-20 14:23:43] <ineed2p_fr> how do u speedrun the game
[2022-12-20 14:23:46] <+MrSamsaZ> depends what you mean by downgrade since if you own a pc with low specs it may be around the same
[2022-12-20 14:23:48] <BystanderTim_> steam deck is 800p
[2022-12-20 14:24:11] <webvi> its just the sacrifice you make to have it handheld

[2022-12-20 14:52:51] <%+Marrickfait> Reminds me of the first TLoU2 run lol
[2022-12-20 14:52:51] <boomcrafter123> @boomcrafter123 cool
[2022-12-20 14:53:17] <Varinathras> how much of the time was cutscenes?
[2022-12-20 14:53:19] <+PrimeDarkseid> just like outlast 2 don't have cutscene skip
[2022-12-20 14:53:24] <bogdan319> now it is just 12.5 ez
[2022-12-20 14:53:25] <Dallou> Thats like people who do FF speedruns. 5 hours into a run and it dies monkaS
[2022-12-20 14:53:27] <Quarthian> Could be pokemon and have a cutscene skip that skips like 2 things
[2022-12-20 14:53:32] <%Silverwolf32> You will see our work, even if you don't want to LUL
[2022-12-20 14:53:37] <freegil> isn't it like half the game's length?
[2022-12-20 14:53:40] <+woodmaster437> choo choo Charles seems to be a fun Speedrun game especially for a indie game
[2022-12-20 14:53:41] <%+Marrickfait> When they implement Cutscene Skip, does that mean the 2 hour Ironwood part will be skippable LUL
[2022-12-20 14:53:52] <+volkin_rose> i fell like any speed run over 10 hours are brutal
[2022-12-20 14:54:05] <%PrimaIvoid> A lot of time, money, and work goes into them. That being said, after the first playthrough, they should 100% be skippable
[2022-12-20 14:54:15] <boomcrafter123> i mean imagining spending days on cutsens just to know that ist gonna get skipt every time
[2022-12-20 14:54:27] <%Silverwolf32> I mean MGS4 had cutscene skips, and we know how much of that game is cutscenes LUL
[2022-12-20 14:54:28] <+PrimeDarkseid> imagine if MGS cutscene or death stranding cutscenes was unskippable.
[2022-12-20 14:54:42] VIEWERS: 1 097
[2022-12-20 14:54:55] <Varinathras> they would probably implement a rewatch cutscene feature in GOW (if there isn't) before a skip option
[2022-12-20 14:55:08] <kambeithewiser> no new game plus wtf
[2022-12-20 14:55:25] <%ElementalYoshi> Maxi still goin in these early morning hours. Good Morning Maxi and Chat.
[2022-12-20 14:55:27] <+woodmaster437> death standing is my favorite Speedrun game to watch for some reason
[2022-12-20 14:55:46] <Potion2> they should enable skip function if you beat the game once

[2022-12-20 14:56:44] <Varinathras> i mean because of people having gotten called and pulling their children out of the laundromat and missing a cutscene and not wanting to replay the game from scratch due to missing some plot point or cool animation
[2022-12-20 14:56:49] <+tommy13_37> is it possible to let the train drive, and you jump off?
