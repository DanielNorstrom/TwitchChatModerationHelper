[2022-12-17 00:03:20] <Tsjoepapke> they are not discussing anything, they are just baiting viewers a little longer
[2022-12-17 00:03:33] <Elementqt> How long has it been like this for?
[2022-12-17 00:03:38] <SuddenData> @louiszrg quantum physics theories i guess

[2022-12-17 00:03:42] <mezboolak> are they gonna try mythic tonight?
[2022-12-17 00:03:45] <Versiondk> yeah the race is like a marathon - consistency is key. No reason to spend 20 hours playing and burning out at the start. that is for when you hit like 15% on the last boss
[2022-12-17 00:03:49] <Elementqt> @murtokqt no way lol
[2022-12-17 00:03:54] <donie1> @shidoni Its shadowed unit frames or something

[2022-12-17 00:05:28] <Nanny> i actually enjoy the planning, gearing, theory crafting part of the race lmao

[2022-12-17 00:05:59] <skihay> go to bed
[2022-12-17 00:06:04] <electricah> only one 1 boss matters
[2022-12-17 00:06:09] <swiftyisthereason> u have my permission to go to bed
[2022-12-17 00:06:19] <Nanny> u dont have mine, and im the nanny
[2022-12-17 00:06:34] <Tsjoepapke> what a bad nanny
[2022-12-17 00:06:35] <+Halle6> Will the demoralisation from Rich being fired affect the race?
[2022-12-17 00:06:38] <+Scratchipants> when do they stop releasing wow content
[2022-12-17 00:06:40] <+D1rndle> They already said on mainstream no mythic raid today, so go to bed
[2022-12-17 00:06:40] <swiftyisthereason> well cant do anything about that sorry mate
[2022-12-17 00:06:43] <+Spaxt3> nanny's a chick ?
[2022-12-17 00:06:43] <skoto91> i think they are sure about the first mythic bosses
[2022-12-17 00:06:47] <skihay> But TBH! if you see Liquids pulls.. they have nothing to worry about! better to get serious good gear instead of going BACK to splits
[2022-12-17 00:06:50] <raven1103> @GingiTV How much gear you looking to farm before going?
[2022-12-17 00:06:50] <Versiondk> @Tarokc go sleep, chat will make sure to wake you if anything happens Kappa
[2022-12-17 00:06:55] <+Aneas> can someone explain why they arent doing m+ during their talk?

[2022-12-17 00:14:36] <+aviLio_uwu> Hey guys, why Echo is so far behind in the progress? Sorry I didn't follow the event yet
[2022-12-17 00:14:46] <stressless8683> doesn't feel like a rwf this time. more like race to world of splits
[2022-12-17 00:14:49] <fluffinsboi> 8 ads, is that a joke
[2022-12-17 00:14:52] <jacobyteme> they're gearing before they start mythic
[2022-12-17 00:14:53] <Lexrk> "Echo gave up" KEKW they are trying to get an easier time actually doing mythic => WORLD FIRST, because of the tuning so far
[2022-12-17 00:15:09] <+pomi2137> @stressless8683 this is far less splits then last time around
[2022-12-17 00:15:11] <torrezina> when are you guys going for mythic?
[2022-12-17 00:15:14] <Versiondk> @aviLio_uwu They have been doing splits to maximize gear on and figuring out what they are gonna main

[2022-12-17 00:15:48] <+aviLio_uwu> @Versiondk in shadowlands heroic was released a week after mythic right?

[2022-12-17 00:16:13] <+pomi2137> yep, and echo knew they will need every single ilvl they can get. Curious what the difference will be

[2022-12-17 00:25:54] <+Aneas> @clicky91 aparently they havent distributed all HC loot yet, he hasnt crafted etc
[2022-12-17 00:25:58] <bearfukuu> what about Gingidrei?

[2022-12-17 00:26:02] <unbreakable_g> r they done with splits?
[2022-12-17 00:26:11] <+Aneas> i expect him to go up to 396-398 mb
[2022-12-17 00:26:13] <skihay> They done with splits yes
[2022-12-17 00:26:13] <BVRBS> @clicky91 ye wont really know real ilvl until tomorrow when they kill first boss

[2022-12-17 00:26:24] <+pomi2137> he should get more loot, they are talking about it right now probably
[2022-12-17 00:26:34] <bearfukuu> @Aneas damn, does this one have 4 set?
[2022-12-17 00:26:38] <%tiaxeu> @pyrow_game on a normal stream he would be happy to answer your question but in RWF mode he’s focused. X
[2022-12-17 00:26:40] <+Aneas> @bearfukuu yea

[2022-12-17 00:26:48] <murtokqt> Its just crafted gear + boe
[2022-12-17 00:26:50] <+Aneas> @murtokqt u think?
[2022-12-17 00:27:05] <bearfukuu> @Aneas well guess the 4 set adds 2 ilvl atleast
[2022-12-17 00:27:05] <+Aneas> afair he only got traded tier
[2022-12-17 00:27:05] <bearfukuu> or more

[2022-12-17 00:34:46] <%Sly360xHmsterEz> @Aneas I think it's because Firedup gets PI so the haste from troll isnt as good as Int from orc

[2022-12-17 00:36:35] <majcan> are they struggling or havent they started yet
[2022-12-17 00:36:38] <+Aneas> so what is the best target for PI then? genuine question

[2022-12-17 00:36:44] <%JerrysBoBerrys> they never did a single pull yet though, I expect they'll 1 shot everything to dathea and grimtotem
[2022-12-17 00:36:51] <+pomi2137> @majcan not started, they are distribuiting loot and deciding mains
[2022-12-17 00:36:55] <+Bazzzel> also 0 wipes on mythic so far POGGERS

[2022-12-17 00:37:16] <%+PMrD97> i think the initial sims were looking like UH dk and evoker getting the most gain from PI idk how accurate that is tho
[2022-12-17 00:37:21] <Flartou> 397.23 now
[2022-12-17 00:37:22] <xotic87> @BestBarneyEu power infusion
[2022-12-17 00:37:29] <ruediruempel> maybe Echo is going for world fastest speedrun not world first kill PepeLaugh
[2022-12-17 00:37:33] <%+PMrD97> but also like rogue just does so much damage so maybe you want it on them
[2022-12-17 00:37:34] <BVRBS> @PMrD97 not sure if theyll be running any of those
[2022-12-17 00:37:36] <%tiaxeu> @aneas just that these guys spend months prepping for the next 7 days, so choices they make are made for a reason.

[2022-12-17 00:44:16] <+Aneas> so he had to go with this one
[2022-12-17 00:44:20] <+rustledjimmys> next tier we get to see raid xD
[2022-12-17 00:44:27] <xotic87> @fiestiq nono prepare
[2022-12-17 00:44:31] <%tiaxeu> @aneas I can agree to a certain extent, i’mfiredup has a definite amount of skill when it comes to min maxing, but Gingi has always been superior in the moment of game play, he has the natural talent to think outside of the norm.
[2022-12-17 00:44:33] <mightylamb123> @fiestiq yes they are disbanding guild unfortunately
[2022-12-17 00:44:36] <ruediruempel> 392 is low, liquid is 400 i believe
[2022-12-17 00:44:46] <fiestiq> how they prepare if liquid have 4 m
[2022-12-17 00:44:58] <%lbalalld> @ruediruempel THEY HAVENT DISTRIBUTED MOST LOOT YET
[2022-12-17 00:44:59] <+rustledjimmys> 392 seems hella low, my alt warrior hit 381 doing mythics the past 2 days and im trash pugger
[2022-12-17 00:45:04] <+woltk2024> is echo doing the race or not ?
[2022-12-17 00:45:09] <%+Jiblexic> Guys, calm down, not all loot is out and uncrafted etc
[2022-12-17 00:45:11] <xotic87> @fiestiq 4m is nothing only the last boss counts
[2022-12-17 00:45:12] <BlackerPearl> Hey guys, one question, when does Echo start Mythic?  :)
[2022-12-17 00:45:19] <%+bobbertbrew> @BlackerPearl Jan 1st
[2022-12-17 00:45:20] <+pomi2137> tomorrow
[2022-12-17 00:45:21] <Peldrup_DK> if they manage to win this i will lose all respect to liquid the head start + echo kinda hard trolling with spilts
[2022-12-17 00:45:27] <FortuitusV> next yeat
[2022-12-17 00:45:39] <prawlx> @woltk2024 The stupidity of these questions man
[2022-12-17 00:45:43] <+pomi2137> @Peldrup_DK nah bro, this is marathon, not a sprint, first bosses dont batter

[2022-12-17 00:45:48] <Nanny> lmfao how did they troll with splits? @Peldrup_DK
[2022-12-17 00:45:49] <Peldrup_DK> if anyone can pull it off its echo
[2022-12-17 00:45:55] <%+tricked2210> @Peldrup_DK WF raider talking here LUL LUL LUL
[2022-12-17 00:45:56] <mightylamb123> @woltk2024 no they not and most of the players have just quit the game forever
[2022-12-17 00:46:05] <Peldrup_DK> didnt they spend way to much time ?
[2022-12-17 00:46:16] <Feinton> @Peldrup_DK is the race over yet?
[2022-12-17 00:46:17] <+elbroto123> @Peldrup_DK thanks for your qualified assesment of the situation
[2022-12-17 00:46:17] <ruediruempel> @Peldrup_DK good advice, Echo should hire
[2022-12-17 00:46:21] <+pomi2137> @xotic87 bruh, as a Pole "german power" rubs me the wrong way...
[2022-12-17 00:46:35] <veiloflonelystars> @Peldrup_DK they are just gearing up to slingshoot progression, better now than later in deep progression
[2022-12-17 00:46:42] <%Hydrophilia_> guys they know what they are doing just watch and enjoy
[2022-12-17 00:46:44] <Feinton> Stop thinking of the race as being 50% done start thinking of total pulls having to be done
[2022-12-17 00:46:50] <+Undying_faith> When all ya'll in here asking stupid questions about liquid and other stuff be back in a couple days be like "I WAS HERE WORLD FIRST" ya'll just hush now say sorry and we will be good.
[2022-12-17 00:46:53] <%lbalalld> they need a couple of hours of clearing mythic bosses to catch up to liquid, they arent ahead at all, echo will now have the strats and stuff from them to easily down the bosses lol
[2022-12-17 00:46:54] <Feinton> lets say entire raids takes 800 pulls to clear all bosses
[2022-12-17 00:47:02] <Peldrup_DK> @veiloflonelystars i really hope it works risky strat if they bosses are undertuned
[2022-12-17 00:47:02] <Feinton> then liquid is only 10% there
[2022-12-17 00:47:09] <Kokocinel> why they dont start MM yet ?
[2022-12-17 00:47:11] <Feinton> and echo is 0
[2022-12-17 00:47:15] <Tsjoepapke> dont panic guys, echo didn't know that heroic & mythic was in same week, i just called em, they'll get started soon, chill chill
[2022-12-17 00:47:16] <Feinton> not that bad if they are more geared
[2022-12-17 00:47:16] <ruediruempel> @Feinton 4/8 bosses are down so raid is half clear Kappa
[2022-12-17 00:47:21] <Diggodyr> @peldrup_dk What do you mean too much time? US has 12 hour advantage so both spent 2 days doing splits
[2022-12-17 00:47:21] <+Aneas> @tiaxeu not sure how much u watched firedup play mage over the past 3 years of rwf but that guy is one of if not the most gifted player mechanically, Max says so himself (also a reason why hes using his POV most of the time) again, dont get me wrong, gingi is a rly good player, crazy multiclasser n all but just hasnt as much experience on a mage compared to firedup thats the only reason why i was wondering about the race choice and i got an answer that explained it alrdy so i know the reason
[2022-12-17 00:47:40] <Peldrup_DK> @Diggodyr ohh the casters said echo spend 6 hours more in spilts
[2022-12-17 00:47:50] <+Bazzzel> cool
[2022-12-17 00:48:00] <blademasto> time for puging DansGame
[2022-12-17 00:48:04] <+SxyOdawg> @tiaxeu Experience on mage? Gingi played Mage like all RWF and MDI / TGP. Are u sleeping or just fanboying hard
[2022-12-17 00:48:09] <%+mcdobi> do we know when they start mythic raiding?
[2022-12-17 00:48:14] <Diggodyr> @peldrup_dk yes they did more + Mythic dungeon keys
[2022-12-17 00:48:19] <+pomi2137> tomorrow
[2022-12-17 00:48:26] <+Aneas> @tiaxeu if you think i said he has NO experience then u should read again
[2022-12-17 00:48:30] <tunakinglmao> Well they should probably start soon as Liquid is 4/8 M
[2022-12-17 00:48:33] <ruediruempel> @SxyOdawg chill out, firedup is insane
[2022-12-17 00:48:35] <%tiaxeu> @peldrup_dk what you need to get is that eventually in the 8 bosses there will be a dps/ilevel/stamina check….by getting the best gear possible…they can stroll through.
[2022-12-17 00:48:43] <+gsTr97> esse afixo foi o pior que ja vi na vida

[2022-12-17 00:48:56] <%lbalalld> firedup and ALL mages in echo and liquid guilds are insane, thats why they have a spot
[2022-12-17 00:48:59] <Feinton> People here seem to forget gingi won an MDI on a mage
[2022-12-17 00:49:08] <+elbroto123> @tunakinglmao jeah 4/8 took 36 pulls, so once echo starts they will have 4/8 in 3 hours
[2022-12-17 00:49:14] <+Aneas> @lbalalld also besides my point, ofc they are all crazy good players

[2022-12-17 00:49:27] <+pomi2137> if you are here chatting and think you know better than echo what they should have done while they have insane team behind them... comon, think about it :P
[2022-12-17 00:49:33] <gympyy> are these guys farming +2s  so they can cap their valor which mean they can cap all their gear?
[2022-12-17 00:49:33] <Peldrup_DK> @tiaxeu i understand that the point of this .) but if its undertuned by just a few % it will be lost time

A good raider is steady with doing zero mistakes pull after pull. Its not like Firedup will do more dmg than gingi, because maximizing rotations and timing is what 100% of all these player can do

I have all the respect for him and know his skill. Yes, I’m not going to knock i’mfiredup as he is also an exceptional player on mage. But doesn’t have the multi skill of Gingi.

[2022-12-17 00:58:01] <+Aneas> @tiaxeu nothing caused any grief after ur 2nd msg so dw about it! all i was saying is that gingi (while being an exceptional player on many classes INCLUDING mage) would himself agree that he simply doesnt play the class to the extent someone like firedup can, and that doesnt mean hes bad at it in any way, its just pracitce and facts... this whole discussion started because i asked why firedup was playing orc while gingi is troll, since i saw him racechanging (still dont know what race hes gonna

[2022-12-17 01:01:56] <+Aneas> @tiaxeu always a pleasure! :) thats what chats for i guess haha as i said, been following gingi and the boys since like 2k16 (early legion) and also main mage since 07 haha just gotta admire talent where its due and firedup is legit the best ive ever seen in a raid environment
[2022-12-17 01:02:25] <GeT_SwAg> What ilvl is gingi now?
[2022-12-17 01:02:28] <mightylamb123> @MadCozBanned yea but imagine what he feels if hes reading chat xd
[2022-12-17 01:02:34] <vanatjordan> what talents that DH taking? is he throw glaive or somethign else?
[2022-12-17 01:02:38] <+pomi2137> @ruediruempel Changes with expansion, in DF its tinker called Arclight Vital Correctors. And actually every prof can use these, since you can have wrists crafted with tinker slots that dont require engineering to wear

[2022-12-17 01:03:09] <%Quaenor> Sorry to ask another argueably obvious question, but isn't it possible to infinitely farm gear doing splits? If you always have some people in the raid without lockout and are able to carry them through the fight, there's no real barrier to just keep going as long as you llike, right? (except for time / efficiency obviously)
[2022-12-17 01:03:15] <vanatjordan> which is aoe trinket?
[2022-12-17 01:03:22] <Pokasquantas> Tell him to go Sub for this fight. Outlaw is capped at 8 or so.
[2022-12-17 01:03:25] <+Aneas> @Quaenor not how it works
[2022-12-17 01:03:25] <melko_> Echo rly strugling, trolling in splits and now m+

[2022-12-17 01:04:03] <+Aneas> your character is only eligeble for loot from every boss ONCE per week, you might kill it more than once, but you can only get gear on your FIRST kill of the week @Quaenor
[2022-12-17 01:04:03] <blademasto> pugging not a good idea at this level
[2022-12-17 01:04:11] <+pomi2137> @Quaenor no, you cant trade to people that couldnt get drop in that fight
[2022-12-17 01:04:11] <xotic87> @melko_ ITS Pug dude
[2022-12-17 01:04:12] <tshirt30> gingi need to tell more jokes

[2022-12-17 01:05:23] <Tranq96> rogue is max capped for 8 targets with blade flurry so he doesn't do more than 100k on tree boss there
[2022-12-17 01:05:25] <Feinton> There we go
[2022-12-17 01:05:26] <+Aneas> @skubb2211 i think so yea
[2022-12-17 01:05:30] <Feinton> now rogue is doing damage
[2022-12-17 01:05:31] <Diggodyr> @shadowsofthepast he got it on like 3 chars lol
[2022-12-17 01:05:42] <LadySkady> What is the name of the skin that the druid in the form of a deer is using if you write me the name please
[2022-12-17 01:05:42] <%+skubb2211> awesome!
[2022-12-17 01:05:46] <+Aneas> they pmuch got everyone done with crafting, did all the splits for now nothing else to do pmuch
[2022-12-17 01:05:46] <ShadowsOfThePast> @diggodyr oh damn lol
[2022-12-17 01:05:53] <+Tasiris> @GingiTV @chat in single target do i have to fake queue arcane barrage if i use nether tempest in between arcane surge and arcane barage?
[2022-12-17 01:05:54] <Nanny> taking the bait i see @mightylamb123
[2022-12-17 01:06:02] <Play0r360> rogue is doing fine, he has lower ilvl and no 4 set
[2022-12-17 01:06:04] <+Aneas> get gear from first 4 and reevaluate how hard dathea actually is for them and their setup
[2022-12-17 01:06:05] <+kasper7777> atrocity
[2022-12-17 01:06:09] <%tiaxeu> @aneas urgh I’m gonna be biased…cause yes I do agree that IFU is exceptional, BUT I’ve also watched both the Pre’s and if you put all of them in the same situation not sure which one I’d back.

[2022-12-17 01:06:13] <+TCGJordan> have they said why theyre still doing m+
[2022-12-17 01:06:16] <zzzap_> COPIUM
[2022-12-17 01:06:20] <%Poochymama> yeah firedup is the best pve mage in the world atm. Still crazy that gingi can picup a class as complex as arcane so quickly though
[2022-12-17 01:06:20] <%Quaenor> so how do splits work then? @Aneas ... is it literally just running with multiple characters per player, optimizing loot through carrying traders and afterwards figuring out how to distribute loot in order to deck out a main for each player (more or less) ?
[2022-12-17 01:06:20] <+kasper7777> Anyone who got hard fucked by loot?
[2022-12-17 01:06:35] <+kase4> I don't think Liquid is undergeared for the boss their progging right now
[2022-12-17 01:06:37] <+Aneas> @Quaenor you need infinite characters basically
[2022-12-17 01:06:43] <+AsboBunny> @zernez_tv it is called bettercharacterpanel
[2022-12-17 01:06:51] <+TannDER> how are you liking group loot so far this tier? @gingitv
[2022-12-17 01:06:54] <%BraveAbacus> Seems smarter to me, just a bit blue balls for viewers for now
[2022-12-17 01:06:58] <PHANTOM23293> Is sebbo streaming?
[2022-12-17 01:07:06] <Diggodyr> @poochymama Gingi has played mage a lot in MDI
[2022-12-17 01:07:12] <+Aneas> echo was able to do 11 splits because every raider has 11 characters, so everyone plays, but in each run you only stack like 3-4 characters with gear @Quaenor
[2022-12-17 01:07:27] <+kase4> I think if liquid kills this boss today, they're gonna have a hhuge advantage.
[2022-12-17 01:07:37] <%Poochymama> not arcane, though
[2022-12-17 01:07:44] <iddkfa> regarding the different strategies, don't you ultimately end up in the same spot at the end of the week?
[2022-12-17 01:07:44] <+gabvosh> They still doing dungeons and splits...?

[2022-12-17 01:09:47] <Feinton> rest of dungeon is easy
[2022-12-17 01:09:50] <Isac_N> Do you have a arcane mage guide ?
[2022-12-17 01:09:52] <+Recklessqt99> maybe rogue running wrong talents
[2022-12-17 01:09:55] <berserkingbroly> @GingiTV why are you not pulling mythic at all?
[2022-12-17 01:10:02] <mightylamb123> i thought DH was tank this whole time lol
[2022-12-17 01:10:07] <berserkingbroly> @GingiTV isn't mythic gear better for doing everything faster?
[2022-12-17 01:10:18] <+RonnieFun> monkaS does that arcane mob pull other mobs if it goes into them? or does it not hit mobs not in combat
[2022-12-17 01:10:21] <berserkingbroly> @GingiTV you can get 3 bosses easily or?
[2022-12-17 01:10:30] <+SleekzTV> It seems like Echo is convinced that the ilvl isn't there right now to do Mythic so they just aren't wasting time
[2022-12-17 01:10:30] <+Alectryon> is tuskar the bis race for arc mage?
[2022-12-17 01:10:35] <%Tikerr> @berserkingbroly they had 9 characters, so they had to do other content to pick 1 of the 9
[2022-12-17 01:10:44] <BVRBS> tuskarr bis race for every class
[2022-12-17 01:10:52] <+RonnieFun> arcane *orb
[2022-12-17 01:10:56] <ShadowsOfThePast> Tuskar BiS
[2022-12-17 01:11:16] <+Aneas> @Quaenor pretty much yea, thats also why they all play multiple of the same class, so they have good bad luck protection, the biggest reason for the gear difference between gingidrei and the mage hes playing now is that he did m+ on drei yday and might have gotten a bit luckier during m0 and pre raid grind since he was "planning" on maining that one
[2022-12-17 01:11:32] <+Quantum01> I reckon they'll start mythic tomorrow
[2022-12-17 01:11:52] <+kase4> DOUBT IT
[2022-12-17 01:11:55] <%+felixthe6th> Do you know why my arcane always says 4 on the WA you use? It doesnt track it propely

[2022-12-17 01:13:44] <%+bambuk275> @GingiTV will you play Mage in the Race? How about your Hunter?
[2022-12-17 01:13:44] <kingearl_> what ilvl?

[2022-12-17 01:13:55] <%JerrysBoBerrys> No tequila shots for gingi if they lose
[2022-12-17 01:13:56] <+Dazdru> Its simple business, wait to see what move your opponent makes and better it.
[2022-12-17 01:13:58] <%+OgSx> is this the last dungeon for today?
[2022-12-17 01:14:03] <Nanny> kase4 yes 4/8 is lost
[2022-12-17 01:14:05] <+Lynasz> Ive only seen them be stuck on a boss while you guys did all splits and play the long game. Fun to see which approach will be best
[2022-12-17 01:14:07] <+pomi2137> @HoppyHippo_ the next race the same comments will come up KEKW
[2022-12-17 01:14:12] <Capycap> if they loose they fire scrype Kappa
[2022-12-17 01:14:14] <dibs_zer> @Awon1 Imagine being Ronaldo in your sport and some guys who played one professional match of football tell you how to score a goal kekw of course you would be salty
[2022-12-17 01:14:18] <+Udiniad> Shouldve done a few more splits Sadge
[2022-12-17 01:14:21] <Spiritakk> the best are the people who ask for three days straight if Its normal od mythic when there Is fucking 30 people in the raid. nonstop question.
[2022-12-17 01:14:23] <+kase4> Im calling it, if they kill dathea tonight, you'll be too far behind
[2022-12-17 01:14:32] <corzy99> 143k arcane blasts okay
[2022-12-17 01:14:33] <+kase4> And blizz doesn't nerf the boss
[2022-12-17 01:14:41] <+Dazdru> @GingiTV to lighten the mood, how many buttons do you press as arcane xd ?
[2022-12-17 01:14:43] <%+bambuk275> Does somebody know which addon the "dbm" for m+ is?

[2022-12-17 01:15:13] <+kase4> @rocksollidx If liquid kills dathea and it doesn't get nerfed, yeah i think so
[2022-12-17 01:15:14] <HoppyHippo_> @bambuk275 little wigs?
[2022-12-17 01:15:15] <Pr1me3001> Why is he doing dungeons and not mythic raid?

[2022-12-17 01:15:35] <+kase4> it's just an insane boss

[2022-12-17 01:15:55] <+rocksollidx> gingi knows what hes doing who here is doing world first
[2022-12-17 01:15:55] <Spiritakk> people Are also too dumb to realize the rwf Is decided at the last boss not on 2nd boss in the raid 😄
[2022-12-17 01:15:57] <%Lataran> @kase4 you are just too smart
[2022-12-17 01:15:58] <+Yoghibear> @Pr1me3001 its like they know better what they are doing
[2022-12-17 01:15:59] <roshfps> @kase4 Even if they kill dathea there are still 3 bosses that are expected to take a while to prog after it. I'm fully expecting echo to kill first 3 pretty quickly with all the info from vods
[2022-12-17 01:16:02] <%donniechad> @bambuk275  If you use DBM, you need to get the "DBM All dungeons" pack. its a seperate one. if you use bigwigs its called littlewigs
[2022-12-17 01:16:03] <+kase4> @Lataran Thanks man!
[2022-12-17 01:16:07] <dibs_zer> @kase4 You make me think about this guys who never played pro match trying to teach Ronaldo how to score a goal :D @GingiTV
[2022-12-17 01:16:07] <+kase4> lmao
[2022-12-17 01:16:13] <%+freddy__g2> How did you guys feel about everything being released at once? would you rather have waited like usual or do you prefer this?
[2022-12-17 01:16:21] <+Quantum01> So mythic tomorrow
[2022-12-17 01:16:23] <sSpOdVyPoDvErToM> rogue doing 0 dmg

[2022-12-17 01:16:37] <+kase4> Chill tf out lmao
[2022-12-17 01:16:46] <mightylamb123> can you play some pre malone instead of post malone? kek
[2022-12-17 01:17:03] <+kase4> Everyone coming for the throat because i was stating something against the team you're rooting for. Just chill.

[2022-12-17 01:17:26] <Kette> Nah kase4 it's cause you didn't really base your opinion on anything concrete

[2022-12-17 01:18:24] <cazhually> rinse and repeat everytime cringe people on both sides who create fake virtual arguments about their preferred side... just enjoy it b/c we wont enjoy this  for like another 5-6 months
[2022-12-17 01:18:28] <+Aneas> judging on how hard the 7th boss was on HC its deffo gonna take some time
[2022-12-17 01:18:33] <NeccroLive> !addons

[2022-12-17 01:18:50] <babagam16> @GingiTV  can u please explain the aoe rotatin that u are doing ?
[2022-12-17 01:18:56] <Feinton> broodkeeper was the only buff of the last 3 that didn´t get buffed
[2022-12-17 01:18:56] <babagam16> *rotation
[2022-12-17 01:19:03] <BVRBS> i mean pointless making any conclusions until we see last boss difficulty
[2022-12-17 01:19:04] <Feinton> so they must have thought it was already very hard
[2022-12-17 01:19:05] <+pomi2137> asmonPray let this man get offhand
[2022-12-17 01:19:27] <Spiritakk> the best part about rwf Is literally the people in the chat who think they know better than Echo od Liquid, the people who literally spend months prepping, have whole teams behind them And Are paid to do this. you literally dont know shit compared to them

[2022-12-17 01:19:37] <+Aneas> and yea, getting to dathea will take echo (dont wanna jinx it but eeh) like 2hrs mb? first 3 bosses should be 1-5 pulls MAAAX and the 4th is like a 10 pull fight maybe, prolly less cause more gear than liquid
[2022-12-17 01:20:15] <mightylamb123> warrior new BiS healing class?
[2022-12-17 01:20:19] <+Dazdru> If that Aneas, as i said previously. They have the strats liquid have used and had the time with people working behind the scenes to adapt the strategy and better it. I say 1.5 hours
[2022-12-17 01:20:26] <+Dazdru> minimal pulls on each.
[2022-12-17 01:20:28] <%tiaxeu> It’s super funny cause as viewers into your world we want the head to head battle, the this boss, that boss going down. I appreciate the tactics just feel this year it’s so different as there isn’t the rush…it’s more about the prep and tackling the raid when you guys are set.
[2022-12-17 01:20:31] <maarni85> anyone here who can tell me how I can get this neck to 395-405 ilvl if buying from public order ?atm when I try it would only be 382 and thats to low
[2022-12-17 01:20:37] <maarni85> Elemental Lariat
[2022-12-17 01:20:46] <%lbalalld> @maarni85 need primal infusion
[2022-12-17 01:21:00] <+Frosty_Evades> you need to do personal order. look in trade chat.
[2022-12-17 01:21:01] <+Dazdru> Primal infusion bud
[2022-12-17 01:21:03] <+Aneas> @Dazdru for sure, but in the end you never know, thats why i was being rather conservative with my estimation
[2022-12-17 01:21:05] <+thebrisket49> damn they still didnt start mythic prog?
[2022-12-17 01:21:10] <krasull1990> are you guys starting with mythic raid tommorrow morning or staling again ? xD
[2022-12-17 01:21:13] <+FroggiTheStar> Yo @GingiTV What´s that rune wich turns u into that thingi?
[2022-12-17 01:21:16] <+tr4xx> @GingiTV what about the alchemy trinket ? is it bad for mage ?
[2022-12-17 01:21:17] <+pomi2137> @maarni85 for 395-405 range you need to get item that increases ilvl and find crafter with right specialization for q5
[2022-12-17 01:21:19] <emillionaire7> gingibass best boomkin best mage best hunter best rogue EZ
[2022-12-17 01:21:21] <%logisys89> why not sleep man?
[2022-12-17 01:21:34] <%JerrysBoBerrys> @krasull1990 They are doing 30 more M+ runs Kappa
[2022-12-17 01:21:40] <+Aneas> @logisys89 he has to catch up on gear a bit n this mage since he had to switch main
[2022-12-17 01:21:41] <Nanny> needs to catch up because of main switch today @logisys89
[2022-12-17 01:21:44] <+Aneas> cause of 4p
[2022-12-17 01:21:58] <%logisys89> oo nnn
[2022-12-17 01:21:59] <maarni85> but does that to be in personal order then ? after got the infusion by my self ?
[2022-12-17 01:22:01] <%tiaxeu> @logisys89 they are not chugging melatonin like liquid!
[2022-12-17 01:22:08] <krasull1990> @krasull1990 if thats the case GG liquid :D :P
[2022-12-17 01:22:09] <MadCozBanned> this rogue is a joke
[2022-12-17 01:22:28] <Feinton> I wonder how he got his score yeah @MadCozBanned
[2022-12-17 01:22:29] <+pomi2137> @maarni85 if you make it public you risking crafter not being able to craft q5
[2022-12-17 01:22:35] <omajgad21> xd this song
[2022-12-17 01:22:35] <Feinton> and how many reinvites he got :
[2022-12-17 01:23:14] <maarni85> and personal do i need to know the dude who mske it for me ye?
[2022-12-17 01:23:15] <+pomi2137> @maarni85 so you might end up with q3, but oyu can always recraft it
[2022-12-17 01:23:20] <gympyy> 8 ads?!?!? man these guys are just sellouts i wanna watch echo lose
[2022-12-17 01:23:34] <+pomi2137> @maarni85 yes, use trade chat to find someone that has right specialization

[2022-12-17 01:27:00] <falifox> im like 90% sure the strat is to use the "Astral Bomb" the invokers cast to kill the mobs even faster. Unless details is bugged and it doesnt actually do dmg even if it is counted on the dps meter

[2022-12-17 12:02:12] <+mwshea> lol just becasue you didn't understand what I was saying doesn't mean you need to insult me. im aware each dps is supposed to do about 6% of the boss' health during the entire fight. What I was saying is that one person being dead half the fight wont make up 8% of the boss' health. I'm correct about that.
[2022-12-17 12:02:17] <xotic87> LETS GO!

[2022-12-17 15:26:28] <%+Jiblexic> I saw how Liquid did this, basically they lowered the bosses health lower and lower until it got to 0hp. While doing that they kept their players above 0hp. Don’t wanna steal strats or anything, but seems legit.

[2022-12-17 16:00:16] <+voxralol> Guys I think Echo was watching Liquid's stream because they're doing a very similar strat on this boss. I guess it helps that they got that information before pulling it. EU really does have the advantage
[2022-12-17 16:00:29] <BigVlass> prog on this boss I mean lol
[2022-12-17 16:00:30] <srrymyfingerslip> I can’t wait till they make an NAEU team and chats head explodes
[2022-12-17 16:00:32] <+mandarinetip> @greenbushcamper it is for method
[2022-12-17 16:00:43] <+dernjo1> Yep huge advantage to start a day later for sure
[2022-12-17 16:00:54] <RaxxFPS> @voxralol They have the advantage until they get further :D
[2022-12-17 16:00:56] <%+Happycast96> @voxralol go eat a burger american
[2022-12-17 16:00:57] <%cjayen> @srrymyfingerslip both guilds literally have players from the othr region lol
[2022-12-17 16:01:03] <greenbushcamper> but arent they just doing limit strat anyway @mandarinetip
[2022-12-17 16:01:07] <greenbushcamper> im confused
[2022-12-17 16:01:24] <+mandarinetip> pretty much lol
[2022-12-17 16:01:27] <srrymyfingerslip> And yet ppl still arguing kekw @cjayen this is hilarious
[2022-12-17 16:01:28] <blizzardpolice69> "team ocean because the ocean flows everywhere"
[2022-12-17 16:01:28] <Twixwhite565> is the other mage streaming too?
[2022-12-17 16:01:33] <blizzardpolice69> would literally stomp any team

[2022-12-17 16:01:37] <%A3N3BRAH> that is it, i am punching my monitor cause of chat
[2022-12-17 16:01:47] <@Echo_Esports> Gear up for raid with a world-class sitting experience. Enjoy the same long-lasting comfort as Echo, only with the Secretlab TITAN Evo 2022 gaming chair: echogg.ly/secretlab/Gingi
[2022-12-17 16:01:55] <greenbushcamper> sadge no sound streams so much more boring to watch
[2022-12-17 16:01:55] <Fruze> @A3N3BRAH Please dont, itll hurt ur hand, and not their faces
[2022-12-17 16:02:04] <greenbushcamper> Can we get spam train to turn on sound
[2022-12-17 16:02:05] <etrnity_0> limit is doing kungen strats and echos liquid strats. YEP also everybody has the same ilvl and the same raid comp so it totally makes sense YEP
[2022-12-17 16:02:08] <%+Happycast96> @greenbushcamper can't you hear the music?
[2022-12-17 16:02:10] <%A3N3BRAH> @A3N3BRAH very true, thanks for this
[2022-12-17 16:02:22] <greenbushcamper> BibleThump Give Sound or Riot BibleThump
[2022-12-17 16:02:24] <%+DubTheSpencer> thats a shitty argument, with leeching tactics you can only catch up but never get ahead
[2022-12-17 16:02:40] <blizzardpolice69> Too bad Liquid didn't copy Echo last tier for Jailer Kappa they had the advantage
[2022-12-17 16:02:46] <+mandarinetip> one thing that I like about liquid they do not turn of comms
[2022-12-17 16:02:53] <%+EnVij> twitch prime is free
[2022-12-17 16:03:04] <+StonedKermit> its not

[2022-12-17 16:03:06] <snorrow92> @mandarinetip they do tho
[2022-12-17 16:03:06] <greenbushcamper> Thats why i dont understand why echo is hiding sound when they are just coping limit strat

[2022-12-17 16:04:03] <+SPICEaLIFE> regardless of gear they gotta figure out mechanics on this boss which is gonna hold them back for a bit.

[2022-12-17 16:04:35] <+voxralol> If they're having a hard time on this boss I think Liquid posted a kill video

[2022-12-17 16:04:57] <greenbushcamper> with sounds even
[2022-12-17 16:05:04] <+jvmes_r6> @voxralol lol
[2022-12-17 16:05:06] <+mandarinetip> well the 13hr disadvantage should b thrown in the trash since blizz said they are not changing it
[2022-12-17 16:05:14] <etrnity_0> and from kungen POV
[2022-12-17 16:05:16] <kenzjzo> I can feel the sparkling water running through my veins

[2022-12-17 16:05:26] <greenbushcamper> They did change it, echo only had 5hours disadvantage
[2022-12-17 16:05:30] <greenbushcamper> 5-6 hours
[2022-12-17 16:05:33] <blizzardpolice69> @mandarinetip Na needs it clearly
[2022-12-17 16:05:33] <+Fonlo> @feebasmash ah ok. thought u got twitch turbo because u use ur smartphone a lot of times, the commercial is very huge, on pc adblock works

[2022-12-17 16:05:52] <blizzardpolice69> they'd be past the next boss
[2022-12-17 16:06:00] <greenbushcamper> Echo was really slow in splits
[2022-12-17 16:06:01] <+FeebaSmash> @Fonlo nah i dont like trying to update adblock all the time so i just caved and got turbo
[2022-12-17 16:06:09] <greenbushcamper> doing dungeons that are lasting 72 minuts

[2022-12-17 16:06:14] <blizzardpolice69> Firedup was padding this whole fight when they killed @udasherr
[2022-12-17 16:06:15] <%PatrickDJ1994> if people think that the US players have a advantage just cuz they can enter the raid earlier you're wrong if anything its a disadvantage because they will show the eu guild the Mythic encounters
[2022-12-17 16:06:19] <%+Happycast96> echo will win anyways, just enjoy the stream now
[2022-12-17 16:06:20] <+Fonlo> @feebasmash gg man
[2022-12-17 16:06:24] <+jvmes_r6> Imagine if eu made a good game and then na had to be a disadvantage (made in USA)
[2022-12-17 16:06:24] <+Malte_L> @ubuhlungu i dont think world first raider play for logs my guy lmao
[2022-12-17 16:06:28] <Killuminati_Tv> @greenbushcamper Yeah and now they have the ilvl Advantage EZ
[2022-12-17 16:06:33] <murisini> !aura
[2022-12-17 16:06:35] <+trooooonic> why is gingis dmg so low compared to the other mage?

[2022-12-17 16:06:41] <elricc55> @blizzardpolice69 what is there to pad on?

[2022-12-17 16:06:53] <+Kershyll> @trooooonic to give you something to talk about
[2022-12-17 16:06:57] <+SPICEaLIFE> once the race begins I think nerfs are unfair. it gives later teams an advantage over teams that fought through a pre nerf version.  however a necessary evil at times still unfair
[2022-12-17 16:06:58] <blizzardpolice69> @elricc55 you can barrage the adds during your burst instead of missiles
[2022-12-17 16:07:00] <ubuhlungu> @ubuhlungu sorry guess it wasn't an obvious enough joke dang yo
[2022-12-17 16:07:01] <klenis> @greenbushcamper They might have been abit slower but they also spent a day extra just doing m+ for gear and reagents to craft

[2022-12-17 16:07:36] <+voxralol> Guys do you think they swapped Ging off of a difficult class (Hunter) to a much easier one (Mage) due to his old age and slower reflexes?
[2022-12-17 16:07:36] <blizzardpolice69> @elricc55 Yeah, but you can use multiple barrages and the main one

[2022-12-17 16:10:57] <+voxralol> Idk why these guilds try to compete when Paragon announced they're getting back together next tier
[2022-12-17 16:11:03] <+Kershyll> @gamesoar_ wasn't the implosion somewhere between that and now?

[2022-12-17 16:14:47] <+Kershyll> @ubuhlungu I mean yes maybe, but it was always a bit weird that people are so fixated on dmg meters, except for a thing like patchwork the bosses / mechanics are a bit more complex and just a number on some meter doesn't tell the full story. would be way more boring if it did lol

[2022-12-17 16:19:30] <%JakeStoney> bro this lariat drop rate is bullshite
[2022-12-17 16:19:37] <+akashaEdge> arcane is definetly the most unforgiving spec and also at the top of the complexity scale, so its double punishing if you screw up
[2022-12-17 16:19:46] <katten6969> how much are gingi paid for boosting this raid?
[2022-12-17 16:19:49] <+Omer2007> whats his characater stats addon
[2022-12-17 16:19:54] <+Soeee> @burkerking1 not really. Thats expected. The first bosses are pretty much oneshot
[2022-12-17 16:19:54] <+MatyNGU> let us hear strats so i can leak them to maximum
[2022-12-17 16:20:05] <+Ghostauren> @akashaEdge Fire is worse
[2022-12-17 16:20:13] <+sundeLIVE> Gingi dont worry just a sip of ELX and you are fine, blast BLAST!
[2022-12-17 16:20:13] <+akashaEdge> @Ghostauren nah it definetly isnt
[2022-12-17 16:20:22] <+fugawe7> @matyngu yeah, go leak strats on a boss theyve akready killed
[2022-12-17 16:20:30] <Mysteel> fire is just bad rn

[2022-12-17 16:20:44] <+seamuscg> @StupidAussieDrongo no
[2022-12-17 16:20:57] <+akashaEdge> fire flows, arcane is 1 wrong button press and you are doomed
[2022-12-17 16:20:58] <mjaber20> It’s rough hearing people say arcane is simple just burn and dump…. Bruh arcane played at this level is probably exhausting lol
[2022-12-17 16:20:59] <+MatyNGU> @fugawe7 yes?
[2022-12-17 16:20:59] <TitiKnowsTheWay> so one question, liquid had around 120 pulls and are 5/8, is this raid tier kinda easier?
[2022-12-17 16:21:30] <+sundeLIVE> wait for endboss xd
[2022-12-17 16:21:36] <+jvmes_r6> Love you EU sucks it has to get like this every RWF gl gl
[2022-12-17 16:21:37] <+Frosty_Evades> Yes they wanted to make this raid easier because no other guilds could kill Sepulcher without mega nerfs
[2022-12-17 16:21:42] <+MatyNGU> @fugawe7 all info good info
[2022-12-17 16:21:58] <+Ghostauren> @TitiKnowsTheWay Which is the way then? pupperWeird bebaCatjamvibe
[2022-12-17 16:22:01] <+akashaEdge> @mjaber20 yeah, its all about protecting your burst vs 15mechanics while executing it perfectly, thats taxing

[2022-12-17 16:22:31] <%+Cyraxe_> this is the 1st raid of the expansion, it's not going to be overly hard. compare it more to castle nathria.
[2022-12-17 16:22:31] <%+vynlord1337> I don't get why they always need to add 600 mechanics in boss fights
[2022-12-17 16:22:38] <mjaber20> Id imagine gingi is cranking out the adderal lol
[2022-12-17 16:22:58] <+fugawe7> @matyngu they dont give a shit how echo handles a boss theyve already killed unless it somehow makes it significantly faster for them to get to razhageth after reset
[2022-12-17 16:22:59] <000000000Machea96> Already catchin up to liquid, nice
[2022-12-17 16:23:18] <TitiKnowsTheWay> @Ghostauren thats the point, theres no actual way

[2022-12-17 16:25:27] <bKahl> @doolaas yea lmao
[2022-12-17 16:25:33] <bearshy> it's because scripe has to curse at them and deride them to perform better
[2022-12-17 16:25:39] <hacksel> this is going to be the same story, liquid will go for the last boss first but will choke and echo gets it

[2022-12-17 16:35:24] <ubuhlungu> @ryasc0 this is the best/one of the best guilds in the world, if they do this it's because hunter isn't good enough, his experience doesn't matter at all really, he's good enough at basically any dps

[2022-12-17 16:39:31] <ryasc0> @meady Thats because the game is balanced around his guild and limit. blizzard talks to them and asks them how they wanna do it and they do it like that. 40 people determine the game for millions

[2022-12-17 16:44:41] <Mysteel> ret is "fine" but it doesn't bring anything to the raid
[2022-12-17 16:44:42] <%bzk1_> last time ret pala was good, was onm Thok - MoP, cause cds
[2022-12-17 16:44:49] <abletoreclaim> Fire becomes a buff, i hope it works ;D

[2022-12-17 16:45:09] <klenis> @Mysteel It brings a player to the raid and alot of guilds need that to actually be able to even try the raid
[2022-12-17 16:45:10] <Sloth_Mode_On> Arcane will still be the play, even after the buffs to fire/friost

[2022-12-17 16:46:08] <%+kazoondk> is he silent due to private talk or ?
[2022-12-17 16:46:08] <Mysteel> @Mysteel but put a ret up against any other dps spec and there's no point bringing it if you have a choice
[2022-12-17 16:46:09] <Lukas__xd_> what's the lore on amice of the blue btw why does almost no one play it, it sims as highest craft for me (disregarding ilv ofc)
[2022-12-17 16:46:10] <+Foher> any1 know the name of primary stats jewel? i cant find it in AH :S
[2022-12-17 16:46:10] <ubuhlungu> @Capycap logs look worse than reality but yeah fire isn't likely to see play with this buff
