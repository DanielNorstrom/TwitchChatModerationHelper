[2022-12-19 01:18:13] <1pieace> Correa i think still not worth the coin
[2022-12-19 01:18:16] <snowkowq1> di maria worth it?
[2022-12-19 01:18:23] <realbonfire> everyone is saying you should have done Correa when it wasnt even a sure thing, pure luck
[2022-12-19 01:18:23] <acnoma> @Tantelic_0203,  mate ive seen it all

[2022-12-19 01:19:08] <!%trilungpark> 200k for Correa isn't exactly cheap
[2022-12-19 01:19:09] <1pieace> Just coz he is 5 star
[2022-12-19 01:19:12] <Tantelic_0203> @acnoma yea right lol. You rate him from fifa cause he has 5 star 5 star
[2022-12-19 01:19:21] <@%Paddeinho> @therealaik1 keep it in english pls
[2022-12-19 01:19:34] <acnoma> @Tantelic_0203, wtf is fifa
[2022-12-19 01:19:34] <snowkowq1> is di maria worth doing?
[2022-12-19 01:19:34] <%+pokamolodoiz> if Correa is expensive then Ribery was robbery then considering this Di Maria card
[2022-12-19 01:19:36] <%Turnburger> i almost thought Infantino was gonna lift the trophy with Messi at one point LUL
