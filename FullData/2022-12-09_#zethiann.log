[2022-12-09 17:08:49] <+Darlgon> Its really prob a lore reason.. as Shai really isnt awakened
[2022-12-09 17:08:58] <@%Joebelle> So it archer Darlgon
[2022-12-09 17:09:02] <@%+Kinjara> The difference between a sol and an awakening wep is the fact you got a sol as a quest reward and everyone else had to drop or pay for the dandy. Just allow you to pay market value or sacrifice a dandelion to make it a dandelion sol. Problem solved.
[2022-12-09 17:09:02] <@%Joebelle> And they can tag

[2022-12-09 17:37:46] <ltsjayybtw> If that makes sense
[2022-12-09 17:38:31] <+veltas1349> @ltsjayybtw ap = ap all ap is ap whether it is ap or monster ap. monster ap only works against NPCs tho

[2022-12-09 17:39:19] <+veltas1349> @ltsjayybtw and the value of each extra ap depends on what you are fighting, and its DR, and if any softcaps apply. at some spots, at some ap, getting more wont help much. at others it will even when you already have a lot. it's mysterious
[2022-12-09 17:40:31] <ltsjayybtw> So I like to grind trees but when I equip a weapon with +58 ap against monster I should be able to 1 shot the trees but I dont

[2022-12-09 17:40:57] <+veltas1349> @ltsjayybtw 58 AP is a nice benefit but why would you expect that much to cause a 1-shot?
[2022-12-09 17:42:16] <ltsjayybtw> Because 252 ap plus 58 is like 310 ap in all so I thought 310 ap would be able to at least 1-2 shot the things lol

[2022-12-09 17:42:59] <%orphic_lightstylez_> Most zones have AP caps depending on the zone as though, only way to push past this are artifacts.
[2022-12-09 17:43:07] <ltsjayybtw> Because thatâ€™s like 60 something ap over rec you know what I mean?
[2022-12-09 17:43:07] <%orphic_lightstylez_> To prevent one shots
[2022-12-09 17:43:15] <+veltas1349> @ltsjayybtw no no, press I and then at bottom left of inventory click "view my stats" you have sheet AP and also many other sources of hidden AP. 250 may be ylour "sheet" number but there are other bonuses from reaching brackets, mosnter AP, etc
[2022-12-09 17:43:25] <+veltas1349> you probably have like 500 or 600 ap total
[2022-12-09 17:43:36] <+veltas1349> not going from 250 to 310, but from like 550 to 610

[2022-12-09 17:46:13] <+veltas1349> @ltsjayybtw https://grumpygreen.cricket/bdo-ap-brackets/ you may want to read about AP brackets to get more of the picture. the 250 sheet number you have is one part of a much larger pricture, many other kinds of bonuses add in to the final "hidden" values
[2022-12-09 17:46:19] <ltsjayybtw> But when I put on osis gear it goes up to 400 something
[2022-12-09 17:46:34] <%orphic_lightstylez_> @Rinetics the ap caps are not reflected in that sheet, they are different based on each monster zone. Some zones do not have caps as well.

[2022-12-09 17:46:53] <%orphic_lightstylez_> x.x
[2022-12-09 17:47:30] <+veltas1349> @ltsjayybtw also, since your AP needs to overcome the enemy's Damge Reduction (DR), the amount of value you get from more AP will vary a lot from enemy to enemy. getting 50 more AP might make a little difference or a huge difference, depending on how high the enemy DR is
[2022-12-09 17:48:24] <ltsjayybtw> @veltas1349 would you guys prefer 10 sheet ap or 50 hidden ap?
[2022-12-09 17:48:38] <ltsjayybtw> I didnâ€™t meant to reply to you lol
[2022-12-09 17:48:42] VIEWERS: 736
[2022-12-09 17:49:03] <ltsjayybtw> Sheet ap is ap that actually shows up right?
[2022-12-09 17:49:48] <+veltas1349> @ltsjayybtw depends on your current sheet AP. if you are at 259, getting 10 sheet AP to get to 269 is a lot of bracket bonuses in that range. 261, 265, 269 are all large brackets. But if you are say 301 AP, going up to 311 passes VERY SMALL brackets. So if you are in  a critical sheet range like the 260s, sheet ap wins. otherwise hidden does

[2022-12-09 17:51:29] <+DSeltmann> also accuracy might be more important than ap against certain enemies ... against my shai in her pvp gear for example 50 accuracy would be more worth than 50ap ...
