[2022-12-11 13:27:07] <docktorkain> Yeah, Cockatiel is a bird. According to wikipedia, "The cockatiel, also known as weiro (also spelt weero), or quarrion, is a medium-sized parrot that is a member of its own branch of the cockatoo family endemic to Australia. They are prized as household pets and companion parrots throughout the world and are relatively easy to breed. As a caged bird, cockatiels are second in popularity only to the budgerigar"

[2022-12-11 14:11:55] <!%RezaDarkside> Google: Fanciful illustrations from a circa-1530 manual on artillery and siege warfare seem to show jetpacks strapped to the backs of cats and doves, with the German text helpfully advising military commanders to use them to "set fire to a castle or city which you can't get at otherwise".
[2022-12-11 14:11:59] <mlwinter> Apparently it was an idea for siege warfare. Strap an incendary on to the cat then let it go outside a settlement and hope it hides under something flammable (like a hay bale).

[2022-12-11 14:33:32] <%Koori_89> From the narrative director interview on Wired No, it's not facts. And so I wanted to try to create something that used those records, to the best extent that we knew, to create a fiction that is compelling within a historical context. Kiersau Abbey and Tassing are not real; these places never existed. But I hope they could have. The supposition that they could have is based off of that research and saying: There were double monasteries, they did exist. There weren't very many, but they were
[2022-12-11 14:33:39] <%Koori_89> around; we have records that they existed. We do know that peasants had these issues."

[2022-12-11 15:45:06] <alizevd> One pro tip: when a new level starts, immediately walk towards crafting station, craft and undo
[2022-12-11 15:45:14] <alizevd> So you can save your actions
[2022-12-11 15:45:29] <alizevd> And the upgrade travels back in time with you
