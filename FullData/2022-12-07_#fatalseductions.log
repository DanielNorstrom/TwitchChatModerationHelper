[2022-12-07 12:48:06] <!%RX_The_Tool> Flamethrower ownership is generally legal in the United States without requiring any sort of background check. As the product name states, it is simply a long range torch.
[2022-12-07 12:48:11] <!%RX_The_Tool> long range torch LUL sure
[2022-12-07 12:48:30] <@%^StreamElements> Don't forget that when you donate $6.66 or 666 Bits you can trigger a jump scare and scare the ever loving shit outta me! seductionsLaugh

[2022-12-07 12:53:36] <@%Carvious> I was reading that too. The problem is there are statutes on the book in my state that could easily apply to Flamethrowers

[2022-12-07 13:09:55] <!%RX_The_Tool> I'd probably be the same way with storage in Minecraft tbh
[2022-12-07 13:09:58] <+LordBoogieBlue> that is a lot of storage
[2022-12-07 13:10:01] <!Livetofight> @RX_The_Tool Interesting I mean i know there are some that are super poisonous but I didn't know that there are very few that can actually be eaten
[2022-12-07 13:10:05] <+LordBoogieBlue> they need bigger chests
[2022-12-07 13:10:41] <!Livetofight> r u sure that is a golden potato? That looks like a golden mini egg plant
[2022-12-07 13:10:45] <!%RX_The_Tool> @Livetofight only about 5% of mushroom species are considered edible

[2022-12-07 13:10:53] <+LordBoogieBlue> for sure
[2022-12-07 13:12:09] <!Livetofight> Maybe it's meant to be sold for a high value at a shop. Pokemon does that all the time. Might be the same thing

[2022-12-07 16:53:48] <%SpededGaming> Ok I'll admit it was a little dirty but it was fun! I was using balloons to fly at the top of the map and I had a flame bow with the perk that regenerated arrows and I stayed up there for the whole game. I had a hammer in case anyone shot the balloons and a med mist to heal storm damage
[2022-12-07 16:54:00] <!%+Nate_W_M> it said it twice tho
[2022-12-07 16:54:26] <%SpededGaming> I probably won't be doing it again because it's super toxic but it was fun while it lasted
