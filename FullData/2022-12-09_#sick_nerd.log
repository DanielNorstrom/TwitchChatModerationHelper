At the load menu to load your save(s), you should see 'DELETE' 'MORE...' 'PLAY' at the lower right, select 'MORE...', then select 'Choose Mods...' to disable. It's exactly the same as if you're loading/unloading a mod from the mod menu.

[2022-12-09 15:17:00] <poopinondabeat> your generator can explode btw if you dont maintain it
[2022-12-09 15:17:07] <Tjarie> theyre coming to ur generator, u should move it outside thr wall
[2022-12-09 15:17:15] <@%AriSlash> alot of unfinished packs like 1 of every 4-5 packs didnt fully die @RotinajEht
[2022-12-09 15:17:19] <@%AriSlash> normally it clears every pack
[2022-12-09 15:17:31] <AHeroicBear> It had 11 days of fuel when he filled it up
[2022-12-09 15:17:38] <EshayNemo> turn genny off while repairing?
[2022-12-09 15:17:46] <Kelemeth> put the generator on your outdoor balcony and wall/door it in.

[2022-12-09 15:18:47] <Tjarie> if you place it just outside your wall youll be fine
[2022-12-09 15:18:49] <@%AriSlash> so it just farms them
[2022-12-09 15:19:05] <%+D4rkmask> this house is a deathtrap x0r6ztGiggle
