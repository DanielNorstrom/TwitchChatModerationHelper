[2022-12-13 14:09:41] <!%NayukitheFae> Over defining yourself through the use of labels as a cringe form of trying to find validation is bad. Just do whatever, sometimes you'll be passive, over times you'll tear chunks out of the carpet with your teeth. Smh
[2022-12-13 14:10:01] <%iLLeSTeBaNos> I'm whatever I want whatever time I wanna be right now it's Top

[2022-12-13 17:52:42] <%reivehnfliyt> @GigaWattsFactory Smart ogryn are rare, but relative to their base intelligence they're geniuses in comparison
