[2023-01-11 00:08:34] <%stuffowf> @slicegangmike as an audiophile you should know that everyone's ears are different and diminishing returns on the super high end items ... you should go out and try out different iems and see what sounds good to you... hutch doesn't have much experience in headphones... hes had a 90 bucks one and 150 then jumps to this 1500... it's like if you had a toyota camry and then jump to a rolls royce ... would you be impressed? that's him... so you should try out and research for your self

[2023-01-11 00:14:43] <%tgwolf12> the higher rep you have the max you can get to sell is four but you would need a 100+ flea rep

[2023-01-11 00:20:48] <%$NotMister_J> gotta love trying to get the bolt action pmc kills on factory and getting trash talked by the chads when you kill one of their friends lol
[2023-01-11 00:20:52] <%stuffowf> @AyeGavMF alright I can understand that.. I missed the convo on specifically iems that help hearing loss ... I thought it was another person that just buys a super expensive item cuz a streamer has it ... but no harm for me sayin you should do your own research
[2023-01-11 00:20:54] <+Diamond_dt> @Llamastyles if you send a heartfelt apology and ask for unban via dono he will usually help.. Wait til he's not in a raid
[2023-01-11 00:21:11] <@%^StreamElements> imGlitch Did you know that with Amazon Prime you can redeem a free subscription to any Twitch channel? All you have to do is click subscribe at the top and select Twitch Prime! imGlitch
[2023-01-11 00:21:34] <%tomc1k> Judd should have pushed lvl 15 like 3  days ago, he still has so much stuff in stash thats loosing value so fast

[2023-01-11 00:23:30] <SpiritEX> I doubt they would do anything special, just an item is all anyone got
[2023-01-11 00:23:31] <+eateric> you need  asigned baseball as streamer item
[2023-01-11 00:23:32] <SavzG> Hope youve been good brotha , its inspiring to see you grow up in the stream community from 100 viewers on the mets , to 2k viewers ballin now , lovely man <3 hope all is good @HutchMF

[2023-01-11 01:19:26] <@%$astrosardonic> There once was a man named Judd.  He played a game that had a bug.  He ripped a thong so we all could get along while my mom gave hugs. He doesn’t do much, but he knows where the eiffel tower is located in Spain. He shoots the sky, so god can’t use his eye all while peeing backwards on the toilet singing Baby Got Tractors. Some day he will be good, some day he will be great.  Tomorrow isn’t said day.
[2023-01-11 01:19:29] <rehyngaming> I believe in you judd
