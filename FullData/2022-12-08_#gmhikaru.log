[2022-12-08 18:59:05] <Frisbee2424> I give it about a 1%. Would be a legit miracle given this many games in my opinion

[2022-12-08 19:00:26] <%+torq_ca> If Hikaru wins, he plays Brazil in the semis.  Will go down to penalty kicks
[2022-12-08 19:00:27] <mchr111> its 50/50... etiher he wins or lose

You can't just write him off 100%, but he is going to play better than he ever has before to have any real chance, but still he's a pro.  But Hikaru will prove to be too much for him.

[2022-12-08 19:09:27] <+CoverlessSkink> How do you choose your tournaments?
[2022-12-08 19:09:37] <SlightlyHungry> Christopher Hikaru Nakamura (born December 9, 1987) is an American chess grandmaster, Twitch streamer, five-time U.S. Chess Champion, and the reigning World Fischer Random Chess Champion.
[2022-12-08 19:09:39] <+Frol_NA> Hey Ben what is your elo now?
[2022-12-08 19:09:39] <Sjoggaren> Are you playing the european blitz champ?
[2022-12-08 19:09:40] <%legalakrondjames> Hi :)

[2022-12-08 19:09:42] <+gggcccA7X> have u improved at chess since covid or do u not study as much?
[2022-12-08 19:09:46] <wsung0> chess is not formal game.
[2022-12-08 19:09:47] <@%+Creamsicle> @CoverlessSkink a combination of them being fun, well run and prestigious
[2022-12-08 19:09:52] <%LeftysLife> is the new microwave more powerful?

[2022-12-08 19:09:54] <@TheTruthICC> that poor b8 knight
[2022-12-08 19:09:57] <EmceeEsher> that d4 pawn so weak
[2022-12-08 19:09:58] <%imenoo> Hikaru will commit to 1.a3 the whole match.
[2022-12-08 19:09:58] <%+imnotkalis> just find it strange that it's suddenly became a thing today even though it's never been a secret
[2022-12-08 19:09:59] <@%+Creamsicle> @CoverlessSkink really it's whatever H wants to play balanced around also wanting to stream
[2022-12-08 19:10:00] <wsung0> many people think so tho.
[2022-12-08 19:10:02] <SlightlyHungry> we should start calling hikaru chris
[2022-12-08 19:10:02] <VisheshKabra> covid ruined his world blitz last year

[2022-12-08 19:10:45] <%+cfdguy2> Christopher Nakamura has been cheating us with his name all this time
[2022-12-08 19:10:51] <%+DoctorJuliano> Thanks my guy @wanderingbishop
[2022-12-08 19:10:51] <@TheTruthICC> Hikaru needs to move and keep his time up
[2022-12-08 19:10:53] <%+Cunahmak> Just a general fyi to everyone that Hikaru is technically my middle name. Therefore, I'll show up on the chips list with Chris as on my ID.. 7:30 PM ¬∑ Jul 9, 2011

[2022-12-08 19:11:06] <@%+WanderingBishop> @cfdguy2 zillions of people go by their middle names, get over it
[2022-12-08 19:11:06] <MessiahR6> Magnus: Ok, let's find a tournament where people are slightly higher rated than me
[2022-12-08 19:11:06] <@%+Creamsicle> @TheTruthICC he's up 20 seconds!
[2022-12-08 19:11:09] <lordgus10> Hikaru's bishops are gonna be sweet
[2022-12-08 19:11:10] <+FoldedWood> also super gms need conditions, yeah?
[2022-12-08 19:11:12] <nesbylol> but when you are that good, you can just sign into every tournament and win the prize, its small but it will stack up very fast @GMHikaru
[2022-12-08 19:11:12] <VisheshKabra> What are your views on Alireza not getting invited to SCC ?

[2022-12-08 19:49:17] <smokeeye_> @myrtlezzz Until the timer goes down to zero. Look at top left corner.
[2022-12-08 19:49:17] <flekx01> Did chesscom allow this?
[2022-12-08 19:49:25] <ExtremeDota> noo
[2022-12-08 19:49:25] <Story_of_O_> I switched to this one because chesscom stream had no microwave

[2022-12-08 19:49:40] <urukhai111> The reason chess.com stream sucks is obvious - if you have someone without a proper title commenting and interrupting a top GM it's insufferable to hear, specifically to people who know a bit more about chess.

[2022-12-08 20:19:01] <%KenoWC> Paryvan flag grey. That N Korea?
[2022-12-08 20:19:05] <%+R4Nier5811> Bok, are you taking on padawans (students)?

[2022-12-08 20:19:17] <VisheshKabra> Do you think Hikaru will out perform Magnus score vs Gukesh
[2022-12-08 20:19:18] <+CoverlessSkink> That‚Äôs a pretty good draw. Looked perilous in the beginning
[2022-12-08 20:19:21] <Jon_83> no way
[2022-12-08 20:19:23] <kondzix16> you're funny comentator you should be comedian!

[2022-12-08 20:19:54] <raaaarrr99> a 4 point lead is worth more if they only play 10 games
[2022-12-08 20:19:56] <Whitelesz> I think Paravyan doesnt care money much at this point
[2022-12-08 20:19:57] <%caseyabell> Ha-ha.
[2022-12-08 20:19:59] <VisheshKabra> Do you think Hikaru will out perform Magnus score vs Gukesh?

[2022-12-08 20:20:38] <+moistdud_2023> there is a 0% chance naka wins this
[2022-12-08 20:20:38] <Lancel5891> $100 is not worth losing your ego this hard
[2022-12-08 20:20:40] <+BQBBBQ> why is FM Canty's screen name GMCanty? that seems wrong to me...
[2022-12-08 20:20:43] <VisheshKabra> He might get more by winning Titled Tuesday
[2022-12-08 20:20:44] <riskymonster1> You are a great commentator and a very nice guy.
[2022-12-08 20:20:44] <sanguinius666> yes, he has an Armenian last name, but from Russia

[2022-12-08 21:55:55] <+moistdud_2023> hikaru may be trying for adoption
[2022-12-08 21:55:58] <futurecorpse3> easily
[2022-12-08 21:56:00] <+moistdud_2023> so he is serious now

[2022-12-08 21:56:26] <Drujica> i hate this caster marking
[2022-12-08 21:56:34] <futurecorpse3> how much is adoption?
[2022-12-08 21:56:40] <Drujica> they literally had like 99% wrong ideas
[2022-12-08 21:56:42] <futurecorpse3> the diference
[2022-12-08 21:56:42] <+moistdud_2023> 10
[2022-12-08 21:56:47] <%+HurtfulJeweler> @futurecorpse3 10

[2022-12-08 21:56:48] <%+Jbreezy_22> that would be brutal for David if he was adopted
[2022-12-08 21:56:49] <@%+WanderingBishop> Adoptions also have to be in the same time control
[2022-12-08 21:56:53] <%+david_dm5> @futurecorpse3 10-0 in same time control
[2022-12-08 21:56:56] <sanguinius666> 10-0 in a row

[2022-12-08 21:57:11] <@^Moobot> @david_dm5 An "adoption" in chess is when one player beats another 10 in a row in the same time control - no draws allowed

[2022-12-08 21:58:04] <vadgeena42> With the new rules that allow to resign, I'd just resign the match and get more of the winning% cash LUL
[2022-12-08 21:58:05] <@TheTruthICC> 0% :(
[2022-12-08 21:58:07] <futurecorpse3> so if he wins this one parayvan is adopted
[2022-12-08 21:58:08] <+moistdud_2023> finally the prediction is at what we said pre match
[2022-12-08 21:58:09] <%+torq_ca> @VelocityParadox no, you just get to claim a dependant on your taxes
[2022-12-08 21:58:11] <KambaBaby> Hikaru jus too nice with it
[2022-12-08 21:58:21] <%caseyabell> 100-0. Gee, that‚Äôs kind of one-sided.
[2022-12-08 21:58:22] <%donthe2nd> @intuicion when you beat somebody so bad that you are their "daddy" that is adoption
[2022-12-08 21:58:25] <vadgeena42> Yep
[2022-12-08 21:58:27] <vadgeena42> new rules
[2022-12-08 21:58:28] <%+bgbbmm> yes
[2022-12-08 21:58:33] <+danandbeard> @WanderingBishop so community conventions state it has to be same time control? I've never heard that and I'm pretty sure I've seen the opposite
[2022-12-08 21:58:38] <+moistdud_2023> WHAT
[2022-12-08 21:58:42] <sanguinius666> its adoption cause you're his dad after 10 wins
[2022-12-08 21:58:43] <futurecorpse3> @caseyabell hahaha
[2022-12-08 21:58:45] <@%+Creamsicle> Should've resigned when it was 1-0.5 then
[2022-12-08 21:58:48] <+moistdud_2023> NO
[2022-12-08 21:58:54] <vadgeena42> resign after 1-1
[2022-12-08 21:58:54] <+intuicion> @donthe2nd so its oficially that? Lmao

[2022-12-08 22:41:31] <+moistdud_2023> only 9 games of bullet is wild
[2022-12-08 22:41:32] <%$GnarlesShreddington> So Hikaru wins $3,444.44 for that win. $2,000 for the win and an additional $1,444.44 for the win %

[2022-12-08 22:41:56] <+chess_zebra> @exiledpugilist twice in a row, very impressive.  overall score, he did lose the match convincingly though, lets not get too carried away
[2022-12-08 22:41:57] <ser_laser> 1444.44 what an aesthetic bonus

[2022-12-08 22:42:10] <%caseyabell> That cost Hikaru about fifty bullet rating points.
[2022-12-08 22:42:10] <%santosud37> To commentator it is pronounced GO-lie-ath
[2022-12-08 22:42:10] <+Foxuba> No interview pausechamp
[2022-12-08 22:42:15] <diskopotat0> the difference is less than 14
[2022-12-08 22:42:16] <futurecorpse3> thats the odds and pay

[2022-12-08 22:42:25] <EmceeEsher> @1resolute1 5 = minutes to start, +1 = seconds added after each move
[2022-12-08 22:42:26] <%beelzedubchess> @gmhikaru seems to have this idea that at 34 he‚Äôs not fast enough for bullet and I think he‚Äôs just in his own head. Let‚Äôs send him love and confidence for his next match. nakamuraFlower nakamuraSpinHeart nakamuraFlower nakamuraSpinHeart nakamuraFlower
[2022-12-08 22:42:26] <Sauveli> It‚Äôs gonna be Hikaru vs Magnus in the finale most likely

[2022-12-08 22:43:51] <+berrybasher11> so looks like Naka plays again on 12/12, magnus vs fabi on 12/13, wesley vs MVL on 12/14, 12/15 for the semifinals and 12/16 for the final if the schedule is actually correct on chess com

[2022-12-08 23:12:05] <+hwwzz> You shouldnt chase a straight draw on the turn when the board is paired and there is a possible flush on the board. What if he had a flush or boat and you hit your straight on the river?
[2022-12-08 23:12:05] <+MontyAndo> if you click on the number of chips you have, it'll change to BB

[2022-12-08 23:20:42] <+HeyItsMeLynx> you're*
[2022-12-08 23:20:52] <+KaliShaf> Yeah that's called a "continuation bet" and is generally a good idea. Telling the difference between when it is and isn't requires a little knowledge of board textures.
[2022-12-08 23:20:57] <aymaneeth> did you win your match earlier big G
[2022-12-08 23:20:58] <+nontooken> Do you like kendrick lamar
[2022-12-08 23:20:58] <%+mslhrt> Consistency is key...or is it?
[2022-12-08 23:21:16] <+MontyAndo> @HeyItsMeLynx i resisted the urge xDDD hard to take advice when you fk up basic grammar tho lmfao
[2022-12-08 23:21:19] <+YodaCards> There are whole courses on flop play. From late position, you can continuation bet frequently, or if you hit a flop very hard you can check and try to trap your opponent.  Each phase of the game has hundreds of hours of training dedicated to it.
[2022-12-08 23:21:20] <eliyeas> Hikaru is the Nimzowitsh defence good for beginners
[2022-12-08 23:21:21] <+Sylixed> Random is not better. Betting the flop should be dependent on opponents ranges and the flop (how wet it is/draw heavy)
[2022-12-08 23:21:24] <instigatorr_> So Levon next?
[2022-12-08 23:21:27] <+cyberjerk242> @thegamer97hs lmao keep quiet

[2022-12-08 23:26:48] <PredPoker> 2-5 is removed, flush beats full house
[2022-12-08 23:26:52] <+YodaCards> Tom Dwan mostly plays big big tourneys in SE Asia and Europe, and high stakes cash in Macau.  He's tight with the owners of the Triton Poker series
[2022-12-08 23:26:56] <spacetimewonder> you remove 5 4 3 and 2

[2022-12-08 23:27:10] <sleeplessinsale> @LeftysLife true yeah he dodged paying it back
[2022-12-08 23:27:12] <+tony_x> more variance, faster paced game
[2022-12-08 23:27:15] <spacetimewonder> basically it gives you made hands more often
[2022-12-08 23:27:16] <tt11mm> Dwan plays mainly high stakes in Macao off the camera

[2022-12-08 23:28:08] <%TimCannon25> Flush beats a full house if u are talking short deck
[2022-12-08 23:28:09] <+MontyAndo> @tweekxcraig1 you count equities...mostly range vs range
[2022-12-08 23:28:12] <thinktanker> poker, nice!
[2022-12-08 23:28:13] <PredPoker> lots of limped pots because of equities running close,good to play if you just want to see lots of flops!
[2022-12-08 23:28:17] <fourouts> flush is higher than full house not straight
[2022-12-08 23:28:19] <+YodaCards> WRONG! Flush does NOT lose to a straight in short deck.

[2022-12-08 23:35:58] <+MontyAndo> definitely could be but heads up blind v blind with top pair is just a huge call
[2022-12-08 23:36:01] <%wv223> how many players were there to start in the bottom right tourney?
[2022-12-08 23:36:01] <%tyranmao> Mr Nakamura, what's a realistic 1 year goal for chess.com rating?

[2022-12-08 23:36:10] <BeastlyFit> just go fish
[2022-12-08 23:36:10] <%gavinfrom3rdgrade> you could have castled
[2022-12-08 23:36:10] <+tony_x> what floats the flop that doesnt have 2 pair, a 3, diamonds, or a better ace??? ur putting him on A6, A7, A8, or a single pair no kicker?? or absolute air??
[2022-12-08 23:36:11] <+MontyAndo> you have to play against his range...not the board
[2022-12-08 23:36:11] <GoodVibesSlotsPoker> sometimes both options are fine
[2022-12-08 23:36:11] <%HoomanNeshat> fold for sure
[2022-12-08 23:36:12] <KingOfSpikes> A9 is probs in your range as Cutoff/Hi-Jack in a 5-player game

[2022-12-08 23:36:25] <%outflopped> keep calling and hope?
[2022-12-08 23:36:27] <+YodaCards> I missed the hand in its entirety, so I can't say.
[2022-12-08 23:36:29] <lennypigeon> definitely see a river with a top pair and diamond.. especially blind vs blind where he can have any 2 cards and it was only 1/3 pot bet
[2022-12-08 23:36:29] <KingOfSpikes> It's in your open-raise range, but maybe not call range
[2022-12-08 23:36:31] <+Mortifiedpingu1> Hi Hikaru first stream I've managed to catch. Any advice for fostering a love of chess in younger children, I have 2 year old twins would love to start playing chess young. :) keep up the great work sir.
[2022-12-08 23:36:32] <Maartenols> A bad fold is better than a bad bluff  ;)  @GMHikaru
[2022-12-08 23:36:36] <ZeBaro> what do u think he is doing for example with 67of heart?
[2022-12-08 23:36:36] <FraileyEffect> advisors to the STARS!
[2022-12-08 23:36:40] <%outflopped> thats why you check raise
[2022-12-08 23:36:45] <%outflopped> to see where youre at
[2022-12-08 23:36:48] <%pulsarjelly> @petertjuh31 you can use some tools tho... but most probably you'll get banned
[2022-12-08 23:36:51] <KingOfSpikes> You have to have better cards to call than to open-raise
[2022-12-08 23:36:56] <+MontyAndo> you put him to the test...lots of times he shuts down when you call with the diamond on turn
[2022-12-08 23:36:57] <ivoooory> I prefer x/r
[2022-12-08 23:36:59] <ZeBaro> not everytime u are going to fold river
[2022-12-08 23:37:00] <%outflopped> yeah
[2022-12-08 23:37:00] <+MontyAndo> nah check raise is awful there

[2022-12-08 23:39:38] <TheAlmighty504> in 100k hands computers were up 2.1million on 4 pros 50/100
[2022-12-08 23:39:39] <+Mortifiedpingu1> over the table poker though a lot of top players play the person and not the hand. big psychology in poker.

[2022-12-08 23:40:45] <%KenoWC> Chatters who complain about people discussing poker in a poker stream are the worst ;)
[2022-12-08 23:40:47] <Artoria_Pendrgon> in poker you need human understanding of who has what style of play like if you have some one who fold alot the one time he calls/raises you know he probably got something good you fold and leave him with nothing
[2022-12-08 23:40:47] <@%^Moobot> Check out GMHikaru's new youtube video: Hikaru's Peak Duck Chess Rating (vs Final Boss) : youtu.be/IOtJjEo0jPs

[2022-12-08 23:53:34] <%+tony_x> ur at 30bb, almost at shove or fold mode
[2022-12-08 23:53:40] <%TimCannon25> yeah Lex Veldhuis and others did 5 minute pretty standard if i remember

[2022-12-08 23:53:44] <+sob590> I've seen serious poker players with 8 min delays. Sucks, for chat interaction, but necessary to be safe from snipers

[2022-12-08 23:53:52] <The_Charm_One> 30bb isnt shove or fold m8's LUL

[2022-12-08 23:53:55] <%+MontyAndo> @tony_x eh i probably woudn't push/fold chart til closer to 14BB

[2022-12-08 23:54:05] <+YodaCards> Not true.  Your time bank is not available on every street.  If you use it all on the flop, it's not there for the rest of the tourney.

[2022-12-08 23:54:46] <jamuraan> needs minimum 5 minutes delay for stream with face-up cards, some do 7-minute delay
[2022-12-08 23:54:50] <Artoria_Pendrgon> BB view is more usefull i think then chips
[2022-12-08 23:54:50] <%+MontyAndo> @horsey7 yes but thats your actual time bank...you have ~20 seconds per decision as well...and you're given more time bank each break in the tourney (5mins every hour at the top of the hour)
[2022-12-08 23:54:54] <@%Xrispie> @R0NGG I posted that on Twitter for the LuLs
[2022-12-08 23:55:01] <BeepImaJeep2015> 75 seconds? Maybe you can use that timebank to beat Andrew Tang in a hyperbullet match?
