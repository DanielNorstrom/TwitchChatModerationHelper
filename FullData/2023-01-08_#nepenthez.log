[2023-01-08 22:44:22] <+rbuckley98> The games played on such small margins, the best in game items make such a huge difference this year especially

[2023-01-08 22:44:37] <@^Nightbot>* Nep plays PS4 version due to the quality of the game and opposition
[2023-01-08 22:44:40] <%+celtlc> @mr_sleepy1 He plays old gen on PS5
[2023-01-08 22:44:43] <kevpies42> I get 2-3 of them every week
[2023-01-08 22:44:48] <%+jsarrami> are red picks on TOW players or can they be promo cards too?

[2023-01-08 22:44:58] <FlamesDotN4> Payet is quality with an engine

[2023-01-08 22:45:03] <dizzydukc> bro zidane is a must
[2023-01-08 22:45:09] <+y6mz> surely they should get a loss for that?
[2023-01-08 22:45:14] <+ismilann> Nep this week is the first time I have matched Hackers. I played an 99 rated bronze team and 3 people that disconnected after 3 seconds
[2023-01-08 22:45:14] <%+Crooksabio> they could just fix that with one patch giving opponent a win for quitting at 0-0... why haven't EA wised up there
[2023-01-08 22:45:19] <@%Witchwalker70> @tsgaming64 Who are you talking to?
[2023-01-08 22:45:20] <%+costel00> pope is great, isn't he?
[2023-01-08 22:45:31] <+dominius___> it is pretty easy to grind the 80+ with bpm btw
[2023-01-08 22:45:40] <BigTTamko> @crooksabio it's done that for years mate tbh that gets under my skin
[2023-01-08 22:45:46] <%+dean_valentine> At this point, I'm more afraid of that Payet than Mbappe. Payet hounds me every game.

[2023-01-08 22:46:06] <Bluenose_Dave72> As bad as konami is, they at least reward players when opponents quit. Think if they quit after 5 minutes in game time, the other person gets the win
[2023-01-08 22:46:06] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> Part 2 doing 👍
[2023-01-08 22:46:11] <+ismilann> Have you also matched hacker this week @nepenthez

[2023-01-08 22:49:10] <%+kingnovakin> @tsgaming64 I don’t, he just talks about the game bro. You’re clearly just trying to get him to bite
[2023-01-08 22:49:15] <@%+SpreadsheetFifa> You need a fast CB with passing to suit your style. Tomori for example wouldn’t work for you despite being brutally good at defending.
[2023-01-08 22:49:20] <%jakehall0762> when will the draft speedrun be uploaded to YouTube, I missed it as I was at work?
[2023-01-08 22:49:24] <choclate_craver> Arsenals squad depth will stop them winning the league especially with europa knockouts soon

[2023-01-08 22:52:15] <FlamesDotN4> @choclate_craver last year we missed out on top 4.  this year they have exceeded expectations but dont have the squad depth.  how are we gonna win the league with one striker for example?  any key player gets injured, we're fucked
