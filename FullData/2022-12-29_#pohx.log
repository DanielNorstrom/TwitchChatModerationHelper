[2022-12-29 16:27:02] <dalkarl> Hey guys, i got a quick question if anyone here can answer, how do you zoom out the map? idk if i'm right but i feel like my map is so damn zoomed in
[2022-12-29 16:27:03] <+corehammer> man i wish D4 wasnt by blizzard xdd

[2022-12-29 16:27:14] <fr33zy_b3ast> I put some numbers into a chrome calc and starting from saint's hauberk is like 40 something chromes to get good colors but something like astral plate is several hundred

[2022-12-29 16:27:15] <+glubw> blizz is a little better after microsoft bought it xD

[2022-12-29 16:27:29] <%+mrp1nk_live> @poppinwheelie FWIW it's easier to grind the 100 chromes and 3 blue the chest a couple times. Should roll with 2R 1G or you could Vorici with 2 blue 1 green craft
[2022-12-29 16:27:37] <+gnostic033> I refuse to get D4 on the principle that blizzard is making it
[2022-12-29 16:28:00] <L1ger> is that an unlinked tabula in your chest?
[2022-12-29 16:28:20] <dalkarl> @gnostic033 i'm kinda feeling like you, i'm going to wait though and see how the game turns out before i make up my mind if i'm getting it or not

[2022-12-29 16:28:59] <typinghazard> this might be 0head advice but I found it cheap to get a corrupted 6L on trade with the right colors, it was like 5c which I got from acts. useless for ssf but if you're trade league it's not so bad

[2022-12-29 16:44:57] <@%lemoncoolers> @kindredmask jugg got reworked last league

[2022-12-29 17:02:45] <@%donavanshepard> swapping from it does give more damage though

[2022-12-29 17:11:23] <+TitaniumFoxx> you can corrupt the gem to level 21 and its huge dmg increase

[2022-12-29 17:12:07] <+thundercrash_the_dragon_> Mortifying Aspect seems to only roll on a Megalomaniac, so without  the 50% mana res efficiency i should not be able to run all the auras.  POE wiki talks about legacy Medium Cluster Jewel
[2022-12-29 17:12:19] <adolebitque> @Shaaymin_ I don't dislike Catarina, but the other masters feel a little bit... Childish?

[2022-12-29 17:13:15] <mitussss> pob shows that awakened swift is more damage than combustion 21/20, but reading what both skills do feels like combustion is better
[2022-12-29 17:13:32] <mitussss> so idk what to think about it

[2022-12-29 19:12:50] <xmasher96x> @the_quadruple_double you can input them into POB in the jewel socket, copy info from trade and create item in pob paste it in
[2022-12-29 19:12:52] <+the_quadruple_double> @lemoncoolers do you have to do it one by one?
[2022-12-29 19:13:18] <@%lemoncoolers> No

[2022-12-29 19:53:26] <+Deedledo> sometimes betrayl is ex peazy and goes quick, sometimes you spend 4 days chasing hillock all over and he never goes where you want him
[2022-12-29 19:53:35] <+the_quadruple_double> I think so?

[2022-12-29 20:06:15] <@%lemoncoolers> @Kairoskai depends on what you're crafting but essence is good, and delve.
[2022-12-29 20:06:31] <@%lemoncoolers> I went full essence on my atlas for a while but it's not for everyone

[2022-12-29 20:29:47] <%Altheius01> On your atlas passive tree you take the four nodes just north of the start, that provide 100% increase to get specific masters. My brain says taking all four counters any benefit taking less would provide. Am I not understanding this?

[2022-12-29 20:45:53] <DesMephisto> Only way I can do a +2 ammy is if I have a mana res synthesis base. I've tweaked and tweaked and tweaked for damage (currently #2 overall RF DPS) I just can't fit it in as inquis and keep the damage
[2022-12-29 20:46:11] <DesMephisto> I'm even doing funky stuff with invocation of glancing blows

[2022-12-29 21:09:15] <+Pro_Mitchell> Hey Pohx, dropped Brass Dome on the RF Jugg, your site says it loses you damage, but it also says is very good on the Jugg version. I don't know if its worth trying to craft a GG chest

[2022-12-29 21:10:31] <%+RainmakerJLN> @Pohx can i store sanctum rooms with one character and run the sanctum with another char?
[2022-12-29 21:10:51] <+Pro_Mitchell> You can not sadly

[2022-12-29 21:13:49] <DarkKwiskas> I am puzzled now
[2022-12-29 21:14:28] <1axt1> Do you have explode? If so where?
[2022-12-29 21:14:34] <DarkKwiskas> the cooldown is also very good
[2022-12-29 21:14:40] <@%donavanshepard> he currently does not, @1axt1
[2022-12-29 21:14:45] <Oct0_Pus> it goes in the order they are in first small line was a suff it first unveiled suff
[2022-12-29 21:14:59] <DarkKwiskas> oh interesting to see expedition as muscle memory :)

[2022-12-29 21:15:11] <LoliKing420> just avoid "immune to"
[2022-12-29 21:15:13] <LoliKing420> for me
[2022-12-29 21:15:23] <CypherConjured> Expedition slows me down way too much
[2022-12-29 21:15:32] <LoliKing420> but it's such good money
[2022-12-29 21:15:46] <LoliKing420> Tujen is god and each 83+ logbook black scythe is 20c
[2022-12-29 21:16:16] <DarkKwiskas> I am like you cypherConjured. I don't know well expedition to craft with it, so I am skipping it, but it might not be a good idea I hear ;)

[2022-12-29 21:16:56] <CypherConjured> I don't mind crafting with it, but I don't like farming the mechanic itself

[2022-12-29 21:17:22] <%vianadota> I used to suck at rog, and now i craft 1 div + items all the time ( every time i have 5 or 10 rolls i get a div or more nowadays )
[2022-12-29 21:17:25] <bondelite2punkt0> WHO is Your facecam?
[2022-12-29 21:17:26] <+quor405> perfect is the enemy of good. also his stuff ( logbooks and such ) are cheap, so cheap to practice
[2022-12-29 21:17:27] <Oct0_Pus> if you want 2 minmax rog you need a lvl 70-71 char to go for ilvl 75 amulets, this makes +1s the highest weight as mods on prefixes and makes it far easier to craft them
[2022-12-29 21:17:30] <+ew_north> How is RF in this league mechanic?
[2022-12-29 21:17:40] <LoliKing420> what do you look for to craft with Rog?

[2022-12-29 21:24:06] <%kjlhs> that guy get more aoe attacks the more ghosts you kill
[2022-12-29 21:24:14] <Oct0_Pus> the boss at the end i think it averages out but havent tried it enough
[2022-12-29 21:24:14] <DudeMcGuyface> I think it just stores the level where you stored it

[2022-12-29 21:24:17] <%kjlhs> so its easier to kill all at once
[2022-12-29 21:25:00] <DarkKwiskas> correct, the boss is not stored, depends on the previous map, a bit like betrayal levels

[2022-12-29 22:23:23] <%Zerograviti> @bravebarry I think it's less cost to make the tower during a blight

[2022-12-29 23:13:31] <DarkKwiskas> Not understanding the difference
[2022-12-29 23:13:31] <adolebitque> Targeted farming, meanwhile people dinging 100 in apotechary maps without seeing a single one Aware
[2022-12-29 23:13:35] <+chunglyy> It is probably a low priority change to make
[2022-12-29 23:13:48] <+veverian> Getting shaper/elder gear in SSF is so fucked now.. I mean guardians is okay but shit shaper/elder influcenced maps drops NOTHING
[2022-12-29 23:13:49] <@%lemoncoolers> we had atlas regions

[2022-12-29 23:14:40] <%CubeStick> maybe that's what PoE 2 is for ;)
[2022-12-29 23:14:41] <DarkKwiskas> ha, so the question is more like "are you okay to move some loot to the generic loot pool rather than keeping it behind some locked door/mechnanic?"
[2022-12-29 23:14:42] <%$RiverSaves> so much "shit" being the keyword there
[2022-12-29 23:14:43] <+quor405> i could see using the Tags to lean the drop chance into areas
[2022-12-29 23:14:48] <Shagath> are you planninig more to diablo4 or poe 2.0? if you had to pic which? I assume poe 2.0
[2022-12-29 23:14:51] <+quor405> but not a binary, only here or here
[2022-12-29 23:15:05] <DudeMcGuyface> like those special bases used to have? (vermillion ring, opal, etc)
[2022-12-29 23:15:14] <Shagath> archievable goal
[2022-12-29 23:15:17] <%shado712> you can have liek "unique droped in this regien have 100% increased chance to be belts" or like that
[2022-12-29 23:15:49] <%Zerograviti> @Pohx also they make some div cards so rare that they're just as hard as getting the uniques sometimes
[2022-12-29 23:15:51] <Shagath> thisis btw my favourite songs in poe
[2022-12-29 23:15:51] <Oct0_Pus> i use ancients/harbi for that purpose

[2022-12-29 23:16:07] <+quor405> yea but you dont get gwen until so late
[2022-12-29 23:16:11] <Jusu2g> boss uniques shouldn't have div cards in my opinion
[2022-12-29 23:16:17] <@%lemoncoolers> reliquary scarabs for extra uniques
[2022-12-29 23:16:27] <@^StreamElements> I've setup a Nexus Game Store --> https://www.nexus.gg/Pohx You can find games I've played through & Recommend here!
[2022-12-29 23:16:27] <+quor405> it'd be nice to be able to farm some leveling uniques earlier
[2022-12-29 23:16:38] <+quor405> kindof like tabby ( thought it is a card )
[2022-12-29 23:16:50] <DarkKwiskas> I would just make everythign in the generic loot pool, and have a bonus on the bosses for some loot
[2022-12-29 23:16:51] <+Smoknjoe24> Leveling unique's should be target farmable IMHO
[2022-12-29 23:16:51] <Shagath> this song is by far my favourite in poe
[2022-12-29 23:17:20] <+kickbrass> it would be like the fossil system, but for uniques
[2022-12-29 23:17:28] <mcpiller> What was the game name?
[2022-12-29 23:17:30] <%JackOfNoTrades> weren't steel and opal rings biased like that? i think ggg is moving away from this model.
[2022-12-29 23:17:31] <%shado712> it will be push so fast

[2022-12-29 23:40:06] <DarkKwiskas> unsollicited opinion: I prefer when you play the music of the game itself (rather than other music) BUT it messes my brain so much to hear the blight song from your stream "where is the blight on my map?" hahaha
[2022-12-29 23:40:12] <%SearingDarkness> I hope D4 is good and Last Epoch gets their "Leagues" right so we can have juicy competition for POE

[2022-12-29 23:42:09] <iyasu17> my concern with ssf is about progresing the atlas
[2022-12-29 23:42:28] <%SearingDarkness> There's plenty of nodes on the tree for getting more map drops
[2022-12-29 23:42:38] <adolebitque> Atlas progression is very easy until you want to get Witnessed cortex / other dementia league bosses
[2022-12-29 23:42:57] <iyasu17> yeah  map sustain
[2022-12-29 23:43:01] <mcpiller> Won't I loose alot of dmg if I switch of pyre to focus on chaos res?
