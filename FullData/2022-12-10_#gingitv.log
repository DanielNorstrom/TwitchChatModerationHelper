[2022-12-10 20:23:25] <Gundamentals> is there a cloak u can craft without spark that can go 382 and doesnt require tailoring chat?

[2022-12-10 20:23:47] <logistics1994> in personal order u can put lowest quality thankfully
[2022-12-10 20:23:48] <+scav_> you can set the order to only craft a 382 one
[2022-12-10 20:23:50] <Amboorius> in trade chat u can do minimum quality

[2022-12-10 20:23:56] <%ER_Jinx> you can choose the quality aswell
[2022-12-10 20:23:57] <%+SteelfurLive> you can specify a minimum level in a personal order gingi, so no way to get scamed
[2022-12-10 20:24:01] <Fleymour> privat order can choose ranks @GingiTV
[2022-12-10 20:24:02] <Tantetango> 5k fee seems to be the go to rn
[2022-12-10 20:24:03] <%ER_Jinx> so they can only craft it if they can do it
[2022-12-10 20:24:05] <Gundamentals> personal orders you can choose rank

[2022-12-10 20:39:08] <+obspire> @xEPICxxSKILLSx You kill protective matrix around that zone, its 100% drop chance for item, you collect 5 and make the item and then click the conduit like he did
[2022-12-10 20:39:10] <Zanathas> As a tank main I think the nerfs are weird, tanks are no stronger than they have been in the past at certain points. I think it's childish and strange to base these nerfs off of Mythic 0 dungeons instead of waiting for raid and all to release and then see.
[2022-12-10 20:39:15] <Grophe> Vengeance was stupid, sitting and turning away from boss...
[2022-12-10 20:39:15] <SurFuse1> Vengeance was so fun as tank, but waaay too powerful when you had good gear so you could stand in everything

[2022-12-10 21:10:06] <%maddershunt> https://www.elgato.com/en/wave-dx-dynamic-microphone the new mic
[2022-12-10 21:10:10] <%dybb0> So we can upgrade the item we created from the park even though we already crafted it?

[2022-12-10 21:11:15] <%+Aluqahz> when's the rwf starting?
[2022-12-10 21:11:17] <Ali1331> ive got 3 titan4s and I've no idea what to do with them
[2022-12-10 21:11:21] <%SyllehTV> SO GINGI, Try to remove ur Citadel & Cobalt on a 380 that u made the thing on, and see if it proc when u go below 380 aswell
[2022-12-10 21:11:24] <%dybb0> @Trickzen im not stuck with anyting yet, i havent used it yet - i just would go ahead and use it if i can just uograde
[2022-12-10 21:11:31] <+bareuheldig> is spark mostly likely to be used on the neck? seems like the most obvious choice

[2022-12-10 21:11:40] <OXDOX> I dropped down my ilvl to 374 through void storage and i only got 1 matrix
[2022-12-10 21:11:40] <%+Reckless135i> @hovsa91 we think its every 2 weeks for 5 then they can come more often
[2022-12-10 21:11:48] <freakyplayer_chris> 11m!
[2022-12-10 21:11:48] <%Trickzen> @dybb0 You can, recrafting doesn't require a new spark, just some of the base mats to make it higher ilvl etc.
[2022-12-10 21:11:50] <+mattz3r0> Penalty
[2022-12-10 21:11:59] <+cones001> i cant see the titan matrix on that quest does it drop anyway?

[2022-12-10 21:13:50] <%Trickzen> @dybb0 You could, the recrafting only allows the same specific item to be upgraded, so you cant craft a weapon now, and then want to recraft it to a ring for example
