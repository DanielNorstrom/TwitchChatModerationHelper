[2023-01-11 05:16:48] <%Zetaphax> So objectively if you tried to use attack set who would even use it? Probably just attack % units that can't crit or don't want to and out of those units which would actually gain more GS from attack set over Speed set since I'm positive all of them need speed.

[2023-01-11 07:46:29] <szyazel> !yulha
[2023-01-11 07:46:29] <^Nightbot> Yulha is currently popular because 1: She has a 100% provoke on her S1 (krau does not) 2: her S2 lets her full cleanse + gives herself a barrier AND cr push, which essentially guarantees she gets her S3 off at low hp (krau is worthless vs debuffs) 3: her S3 ignores all damage share (including arrowell's escort) + heals her if it kills. She is a solid answer to currently popular units like Lhc, adin, riolet, etc due to how easy it is for her to kill them with her S3

[2023-01-11 08:28:00] <@%Lacari> or something
[2023-01-11 08:28:12] <%thedefault888> Maybe give lqc a built in hell cutter that isn‚Äôt as good for her passive, which can let us use crimson seed for cleanse

[2023-01-11 08:28:27] <xzoratu> she needs seline passive lowkey
[2023-01-11 08:28:28] <revdanny> LQC have her passive include can‚Äôt be stunned or CR push when enemy used passive self cr push?
[2023-01-11 08:28:29] <%ie_g> cannot be stunned + cannot be silenced + cannot be sleep pretty good unit :)
[2023-01-11 08:28:34] <MrUniCornePower> I mean they also added strip to every debuffer

[2023-01-11 10:48:02] <Darren_35> she's only good in guild war
[2023-01-11 10:48:13] <TalesTyrone> SG also need to look at audio/voices for characters again, it sounds like they have been bass boosted or smth these past couple releases - its sounded terrible
[2023-01-11 10:48:15] <%yorozuya06> one day Sharklotte and Sharun will get buffed CopiumTruck
[2023-01-11 10:48:19] <watcherx0> ae-Karina on counter set does she need speed boots ?

[2023-01-11 10:49:53] <nyxxlul> laika is just better ningning ok

[2023-01-11 10:49:58] <%+Danzras> eversoul on ld player sucks, eversoul on pretty much any emulator sucks rn @shakeofinfinity
[2023-01-11 10:49:58] <dracostan> I see TONS of Karina instead tho
[2023-01-11 10:50:00] <I_Watch_Eromanga_Sensei> ningning s3 looks like she using the bathroom HUH

[2023-01-11 10:50:02] <Sakai_Senpai> Because you need brain to use her, and this is E7
[2023-01-11 10:50:07] <%barald> DJB is very prevelant
[2023-01-11 10:50:13] <%doushirou> definely not me
[2023-01-11 10:50:15] <TalesTyrone> every1 trashed Karina, but shes the most oppressive one right now just cos of the splash dmg
[2023-01-11 10:50:16] <+SlickCriminal> is there a 64 bit dl for it @Jenazad
[2023-01-11 10:50:17] <twitchlk45> did you see a ravi?
[2023-01-11 10:50:23] <%+Nauqeas> Karina is anti cleave/anti aggro only. Winter is anti destina/anti handguy, ningning anti barrier/aggro, and gisselle is cope, just use roy
[2023-01-11 10:50:30] <+Kenpachi5> too much brain power
[2023-01-11 10:50:50] <%shinzen_sho> Do you think its because of Laika that Ningning is not picked that much?

[2023-01-11 10:51:55] <TalesTyrone> I wonder why they didn't do the JP collab way and just have the idols do voicelines in korean and have that be the default voice

[2023-01-11 12:54:36] <%eljackoloco> @remotoz The idea that something small, like getting coffee, can have much larger effects, such as altering your career is called the butterfly effect. The butterfly effect rests on the notion that the world is deeply interconnected, such that one small occurrence can influence a much larger complex system.
