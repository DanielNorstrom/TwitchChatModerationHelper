[2022-12-23 21:51:39] <+itchyfingerz_> I wonder if FURIA are next to leave competitive apex?

[2022-12-23 23:23:45] <%goonerpower4> Hes 17 though no?
[2022-12-23 23:23:48] <%tobixmisery> would you prefer a 3rd roller or an MNK player?

[2022-12-23 23:25:00] <rocker17099> skins and weapons for money would have been good for both orgs and ea

[2022-12-23 23:27:07] <rocker17099> zach/alb co igl with u 2 would be great
[2022-12-23 23:27:08] <rimmerssb> I’m gutted, I love you both! Miss the old aim assist days! But I do agree, hunger is key and you’ve always been such a crack head for hard work, can’t see you failing bro

[2022-12-23 23:28:15] <%goonerpower4> I'd assume Chaotic is waiting to hear about more options for himself right now.
[2022-12-23 23:28:20] <shinobi_whispa> would you do another game or reg job if no apex ?
[2022-12-23 23:28:23] <%+shaun1903> tripods replace deeds  Kappa
[2022-12-23 23:28:24] <%goonerpower4> Based on how you're presenting it
[2022-12-23 23:28:40] <rimmerssb> Do you see sentinels as a viable option?
[2022-12-23 23:28:44] <tony_desbois> is resultuh done with apex?

[2022-12-23 23:30:49] <@%+Youphoriia> SEN should absolutely drop senoxe for you and chaotic i’m sorry but it needs to be said
[2022-12-23 23:30:58] <rayy_keith> do you know if jordan is retring?
[2022-12-23 23:31:08] <greedyfroggo> Honestly please Look for MnK, it will open up a different dimension in your games.
