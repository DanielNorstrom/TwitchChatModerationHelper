[2022-12-24 19:09:03] <%Slenard> with winter, you need more layers NODDERS
[2022-12-24 19:09:07] <Marvin_EO> just like a perfectly medium temp
[2022-12-24 19:09:11] <%+Thiago_IHF> Here we only have 4 different types of summer. I'm forced to hate it
[2022-12-24 19:09:15] <%Benisz> I like spring :D
[2022-12-24 19:09:18] <%ishiikitty> I'm conflicted. I like wrapping up in a cozy blanket, but I also like the beach
[2022-12-24 19:09:19] <%$KirosTheGreat> You can always layer on more clothes. Can't do that in reverse rikkuThisisfine
[2022-12-24 19:09:23] <+ogJuhoy> i like spring/fall, where i live winter hits -30 and summer hits +30
[2022-12-24 19:09:26] <%Lakshata> My only problem with winter is it gets dark at like 4:30PM
[2022-12-24 19:09:31] <Marvin_EO> nah spring is like heaven where i'm at
