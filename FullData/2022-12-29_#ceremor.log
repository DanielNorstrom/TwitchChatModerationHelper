[2022-12-29 02:21:52] <%+ObiFizzle> Scrub has been slang for an “insignificant or contemptible person” since the 1500s. Over the centuries, the term was used as a slur to denigrate prostitutes and even Black people for a time. In the late 1800s, scrub was being used by athletes to deride inferior opponents. The term derives from a form of shrub.

[2022-12-29 05:07:34] <MrRipTV> impact but its not on target with front post. does tarkov have sight zeroing?
[2022-12-29 05:07:35] <@%+iHodge> I think it went high

[2022-12-29 05:08:34] <MrRipTV> did you have gun zeroed at like 500 meters? cuz that looks like no reg or gun zeroed too far out. impact is too high above front post

[2022-12-29 05:41:16] <BakedKipling> from what ive seen it lasts a few seconds
[2022-12-29 05:41:17] <josie_posie_> yes but you can stack it with haste and then run around with it, you can also increase the duration significantly with good gear
[2022-12-29 05:41:19] <@%+Chaosshield> they can MOVE FAST with haste though

Just trying to clarify that I called him a sellout because I thought he was playing on base servers for real after this "fucking hate basers" stance. Apparently the best approach is to shut up and not stand up for yourself. Sounds fucking toxic to me. Don't speak your mind. I should have observed before judging and calling him a sellout. He's still a fuck though and ya'll are toxic.

[2022-12-29 07:17:44] <drillbitjr> @dorstusnot if you’re playing different maps or servers completely. But if streamers are playing Namalsk and you’re playing Namalsk, not a good look.

[2022-12-29 07:18:13] <LowLevelCode> Your streamer could raid somebody on your server when you’re not paying attention.

Just trying to clarify that I called him a sellout because I thought he was playing on base servers for real after this "fucking hate basers" stance. Apparently the best approach is to shut up and not stand up for yourself. Sounds fucking toxic to me. Don't speak your mind. I should have observed before judging and calling him a sellout. He's still a fuck though and ya'll are toxic.
