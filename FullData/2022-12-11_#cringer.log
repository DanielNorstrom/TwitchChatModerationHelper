[2022-12-11 14:10:51] <Herr_God> the graphis looks amazing (or i at least understand whatÂ´s happening). Is this modded or?

[2022-12-11 14:11:26] <Theimp201> its the steam version which came out recently with actual graphics lol
[2022-12-11 14:11:26] <jn2o> but steam has mods
[2022-12-11 14:11:26] <Herr_God> I am indeed unaware of that
[2022-12-11 14:12:17] <Theimp201> when you get used to the old version, controls give you such a hard time for a while
[2022-12-11 14:12:50] <+ImperialZat> Yeah, not being able to see previous events happening is maybe the only loss compared to the OG game

[2022-12-11 14:13:20] <%Arazaki> the holes come from tree roots i believe
[2022-12-11 14:13:57] <jn2o> i am guessing they will fix the problems eventually
[2022-12-11 14:14:07] <Suoveri> didn't the classic version have a key to advance time on tick? I remember watching fights like that
[2022-12-11 14:14:10] <%Shi__Nobi> @HouseOfDoggus that depends
[2022-12-11 14:14:14] <PricelessTalk> you might believe its a belief free zone.. but... ;-)
[2022-12-11 14:14:19] <%HouseOfDoggus> What if his beliefs are about bacon being crispy?

[2022-12-11 14:14:30] <Theimp201> i mean kitfox games said that the game only 44% complete of what they actually aim
[2022-12-11 14:14:48] <jn2o> i just killed a forgotten beast and only lost a chicken and a dog

[2022-12-11 14:16:31] <nickburns> chop the tree before digging under it, you wont have the issue of roots leaving holes.

[2022-12-11 14:40:40] <+Enterprise12> it reminds of the game towns graphically wise.
[2022-12-11 14:40:54] <decentfarts> I have tried DF a few times before. maybe this version will be approachable enough to play

[2022-12-11 14:41:55] <Dusty_Monk> @Mini_B1892 That's one of those words I've read looked up in a lexicon then subsequently forgotten the meaning of.
[2022-12-11 14:41:56] <+Microflora> DF was the inspiration for games like minecraft and rimworld
[2022-12-11 14:41:57] <Kalderasch> Howdy, monsieur Cringer!
[2022-12-11 14:42:02] <migotek2> rimworld is DF for kids
[2022-12-11 14:42:05] <%thebosslevel> RimWorld is dwarf fort, but you only have one level
[2022-12-11 14:42:23] <%thebosslevel> dwarf fort let's you dig to hell
[2022-12-11 14:42:32] <+HornDogRooster> yeah definitely

[2022-12-11 14:42:40] <JBrown247> then what is the most complex game of all time?
[2022-12-11 14:42:43] <+HornDogRooster> how long has dwarf fortress been in development
[2022-12-11 14:42:45] <@%$Asiak> If someone were to ask me what the deepest game out there is, I would say either this or EVE online
[2022-12-11 14:42:45] <Dusty_Monk> There's a lot of complexity in DF but a lot of it is nonsensical gibberish
[2022-12-11 14:42:48] <%thebosslevel> yrue
[2022-12-11 14:42:54] <+Enterprise12> i willl probably watch until deciding to buy! the graphics do look ooof, while i do care for gameplay first, i have a baseline for graphics xDD
[2022-12-11 14:42:55] <decentfarts> DF has been the learning curve game
[2022-12-11 14:43:06] <%$k_nord> this is obtuse and have a lot of mechanics: so this games "complexity" is your knowledge and keeping track of stuff and things
[2022-12-11 14:43:23] VIEWERS: 495
[2022-12-11 14:43:23] <decentfarts> so hopefully the UI and stuff gets good enough to cut the learning curve
[2022-12-11 14:43:33] <JBrown247> I head Dwarf Fortress is just like NBA 2k19
[2022-12-11 14:43:37] <Hannah_Honeybee> rimworld is a better game. df is a better simulation.
[2022-12-11 14:43:37] <%Soviet666> dorfs cringeOoh
[2022-12-11 14:43:40] <decentfarts> already we are not trying to understand ASCII symbols lol
[2022-12-11 14:44:03] <%thebosslevel> everything will change once adventure mode hits tho
[2022-12-11 14:44:12] <+Enterprise12> mmm that sounds like a cool description
[2022-12-11 14:44:23] <+HornDogRooster> I wouldn't say better game
[2022-12-11 14:44:29] <Glentech1> DF is a little more sandbox it sounds like.
[2022-12-11 14:44:40] <+HornDogRooster> yeah
[2022-12-11 14:44:42] <+HornDogRooster> exactly
[2022-12-11 14:44:45] <lycones> @thebosslevel what does adventure mode do?
[2022-12-11 14:44:49] <ToinKoss> from what i'm hearing, i think i'd like Dwarf Fortress more than Rimworld. should give it a try
[2022-12-11 14:44:52] <TonySopranosGabagool> Both games are cheap, does it matter which is better? haha
[2022-12-11 14:45:05] <+HornDogRooster> I definitely don't find dwarf fortress to be my cup of tea, but I wouldn't say its inferior to rimworld
[2022-12-11 14:45:17] <decentfarts> those guys didn't say goodbye?
[2022-12-11 14:45:23] VIEWERS: 495
[2022-12-11 14:45:45] <%thebosslevel> @lycones well, since you asked, you play a character that can go to your own tavern you built, if you load adventure mode in your current fortress file.
[2022-12-11 14:45:56] <decentfarts> is this game music?
[2022-12-11 14:46:00] <%thebosslevel> it basically makes.npcs that give you rat quests
[2022-12-11 14:46:01] <@%$Asiak> Yes
[2022-12-11 14:46:25] <+HornDogRooster> yeah I see that
[2022-12-11 14:46:26] <Nywro> Columbo missing the coffee on that case. Get'em next time.
[2022-12-11 14:46:28] <lycones> @thebosslevel hmmh and then what you do with that character? just visit your fortress?
[2022-12-11 14:47:14] <+Enterprise12> right right, rimworld you can only manage so many
[2022-12-11 14:47:23] VIEWERS: 528
[2022-12-11 14:47:37] <%thebosslevel> @lycones that's an option, it's pretty much tales of mejalal but you can use your curry world file
[2022-12-11 14:47:53] <+HornDogRooster> yeah Dwarf Fortress seems so extensive
[2022-12-11 14:48:04] <%Soviet666> I on the other hand can't keep up adding beds and I wish there was an option to pause immigration
[2022-12-11 14:48:15] <+Enterprise12> man i would love to see this game kind of graphically updated(ik it kinda was) but the way dwarfes move and such, it feels old which ig it is haha
[2022-12-11 14:48:29] <deludedtoaster> rimworld is more about the individuals while dwarf fortress is more about a bigger collective as well
[2022-12-11 14:48:31] <+Enterprise12> the actual gameplay looks cool
[2022-12-11 14:48:33] <%thebosslevel> you can go wherever to talk to randomly generated npcs, but you can also take fortd as your own thralls ~~~
[2022-12-11 14:48:48] <%oldmanexo48> @Soviet666 Stop being a border country then :p
[2022-12-11 14:48:54] <+HornDogRooster> @Enterprise12 lol better than it used to look, man that ascii dwarf fortress, I couldn't believe people played it like that
[2022-12-11 14:48:55] <%thebosslevel> really fun to invade your last DED fort as a necromancer
[2022-12-11 14:48:56] <%Arazaki> @Enterprise12 you can pause migrants, in settings you can lower the population number of the fort temporarily

[2022-12-11 15:38:01] <%Soviet666> and brew from plants, that gives you seeds baenn

[2022-12-11 15:38:56] <%$k_nord> I've noticed you can build under "some" stuff. maybe it's chairs etc
[2022-12-11 15:39:36] <JBrown247> You have to imagine everything, just not that everything
[2022-12-11 15:39:36] <@Belannaer> removing mass amount of furniture or buildings is pain in the butt too
[2022-12-11 15:39:44] <+Beane666> IRL it sucks I gotta move my stuff to replace my carpet.

[2022-12-11 15:42:14] <lilliiilill> why don't we just simulate work being done? then we don't even need time to be a factor in our game!
[2022-12-11 15:42:15] <%JohnDoeRadio> but its a game with unicorns seqY
[2022-12-11 15:42:16] <iLoveYhou> then people would complain about it being unrealistic that you dont have to move stuff to do flooring
[2022-12-11 15:42:17] <%JohnDoeRadio> i need my imagination for flooring
[2022-12-11 15:42:17] <%GeneralLoafer> Can't you move the storage space, put in floors and move them back?
[2022-12-11 15:42:18] <+IndieBob> ur 2 casul 4 df
[2022-12-11 15:42:33] <%semmy1981> @Cringer why bother with floors?
[2022-12-11 15:43:04] <%Arazaki> don't worry, you can nitpick all you want. there are many nitpickable things about this game
[2022-12-11 15:43:06] <+Arskiss> remove the chair puts it back to storage or destroys it?

[2022-12-11 15:43:32] <%+wikes60> Floor Fungus... its like a natural growing snack for dwarves
[2022-12-11 15:43:35] <%oldmanexo48> Tell your workers to stop walking around barefoot and take care about treating their foot fungus
[2022-12-11 15:43:43] <+Rockwell_Hardline> OSHA is for real in df
[2022-12-11 15:43:45] <%oldmanexo48> And that will solve the floor fungus amungus
