[2022-12-26 07:13:41] <%+deformedpoet> Commercial banana production in the United States is relatively limited in scale and economic impact. While Americans eat 26 pounds (12 kg) of bananas per person per year, the vast majority of the fruit is imported from other countries, chiefly Central and South America, where the US has previously occupied areas containing banana plantations, and controlled the importation of bananas via various fruit companies, such as Dole and Chiquita.[1]

[2022-12-26 07:17:22] <!%+statistic68> you gotta stop calling them "Marijuana ciggarettes" though, it sounds weird... and i LOVE the rush hour moves too.. I met Jackie Chan when i was a kid on the set of cannonball run
[2022-12-26 07:17:53] <%+deformedpoet> i was watching a top 30 films doco on ty today

[2022-12-26 07:18:35] <%blondejohn96> jaws is a movie worth watching
[2022-12-26 07:18:38] <StarsyNA> Jaws is amazing
[2022-12-26 07:18:41] <%blondejohn96> it's also a book worth reading
[2022-12-26 07:18:41] <!%$vintagerudy> the fuck dude, Jaws

[2022-12-26 07:19:45] <+backtobraize> but it is in fact worth watching

[2022-12-26 07:22:25] <StarsyNA> I think Parasite is meant to be funny
[2022-12-26 07:22:29] <StarsyNA> it's a dark comedy
[2022-12-26 07:22:34] <@%Tazny> The bad guy literally looked like he had googly eyes
[2022-12-26 07:22:44] <%+zac_rules> Parasite definitely feels like a smart dark comedy

[2022-12-26 07:26:31] <@%Tazny> @go4pool Oh yeah it was definitely something to do with ghosts hiding in computers and moving through the internet. The concept was fine but the movie felt very disjointed and strange and hard to follow. But maybe that was on purpose
[2022-12-26 07:26:40] <!%+statistic68> later i learned he didn't believe in\like giving autographs

[2022-12-26 07:31:45] <go4pool> @Tazny Yeah. I think it was exploring a "what if" electromagnetics allowed different realities to blend/bleed over.   (Hm, kinda like a manga I read much later.)  It's pacing was similar to the original grudge, ringu and some other jap. horrors of that time.
[2022-12-26 07:31:56] <+linearflux> Tom Brady kisses him kid on the mouth
[2022-12-26 07:32:03] <!%$vintagerudy> We need Heros that share the welth
[2022-12-26 07:32:38] <@%Tazny> @go4pool Yeah I appreciate the more eerie horrors for sure that focus more on atmosphere than gore so I didnt mind it. But that one scene I watched ended up being better to me than the movie as a whole unfortunately

[2022-12-26 11:45:25] <%+deformedpoet> it should give each walnut a diff ability

[2022-12-26 11:46:29] <RedSuitcase> terrible cropping
[2022-12-26 11:46:30] <AvasiiaHS> it's an ok keyword
[2022-12-26 11:46:31] <@%gesticulate> maybe just show the horse in every portrait and turn this into an equestrian's wet dream
[2022-12-26 11:47:35] <@%Tazny> Yeah agreed, I think this is the worst offender but theres certainly plenty of other examples of bad cropping and just poor quality art in general
[2022-12-26 11:47:44] <AvasiiaHS> don't bring inspire back plz
[2022-12-26 11:47:48] <@%gesticulate> they should have a single card with every keyword YEP
