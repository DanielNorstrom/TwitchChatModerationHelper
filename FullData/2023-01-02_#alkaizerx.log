[2023-01-02 00:18:59] <%Artlu_> if they would nerf all spells by mobs by like 20% and delete suppression then the game would be in a better state

[2023-01-02 00:20:02] <%+minervathecat_> It feels like everything is balanced around spell suppression so you are pretty forced into it, I don't think that's healthy

[2023-01-02 00:20:56] <+angstadillio> what about spell block
[2023-01-02 00:21:01] <%nomadx> I think there should be more sources of spell mitigation, maybe that aligns with the archetypes more
[2023-01-02 00:21:07] <%brett19953> undead wizard guys do way too much damage, even through suppression
[2023-01-02 00:21:10] <%nomadx> spell supp is a just a generalist fit all and it's mandatory
[2023-01-02 00:21:11] <uhhhhahhhhohahhh> can you even cap it without tree nodes?
[2023-01-02 00:21:15] <%+me_bobo> multi totem rejuv totem + devouring totem + exarch boots +wings of entropy
[2023-01-02 00:21:19] <%nomadx> there should be str/dex/int ways to mitigate spell dmg that you can gear for
[2023-01-02 00:21:42] <selfish_crawler> ye, hate when ES build can't get suppression

[2023-01-02 00:21:48] <orange_bean> just invite another player
[2023-01-02 00:21:51] <uhhhhahhhhohahhh> they should make Glancing Blows 100% block cap
[2023-01-02 00:21:51] <%Kliz> also the more likely changes made it so much more annoying to get the necessary amount in gear that doesnt feel shit to use :)
[2023-01-02 00:21:53] <%Klawgor> Even on soft core you try to cap suppress alkXD
[2023-01-02 00:22:00] <uhhhhahhhhohahhh> its already worse than Suppress because you take more dmaage
[2023-01-02 00:22:01] <GrubThug> if suppression couldnt get to 100% do you guys think people would get it at all?

[2023-01-02 01:55:24] <crudeshag> Bone zone is a term created by fans of Ken Bone, aka boneheads, that refers to their adoration for the man. Ken Bone became an instant sensation when asking a question during the October 9, 2016 U.S. presidential town hall debate.

[2023-01-02 02:44:43] <%+Venanci0_> The Heist league has the player organizing Heists to infiltrate and steal from fortified caches of valuables. After finding a Rogue's Marker, the player can use it to visit the Rogue Harbour and run Contracts for the rogue's guild known as the Ring. The player is tasked to infiltrate an area containing a valuable item with a help of a Rogue for hire. They must secure the item and take as many other valuables as possible before lockdown occurs

[2023-01-02 19:09:55] <Chesten> So I've been looking at your build on path of building, dps vs map bosses is about 8mil at 50stacks, 2.5m vs uber bosses, in terms of gems- awakened multistrike is about a 15% dmg increase instead of close combat, eff hp pool is about 200k, weakest vs ubers atrizi for some reason at 150k

[2023-01-02 22:17:06] <RobertusAmor> standing around handcasting arc is one of the worst experiences you can have in POE
[2023-01-02 22:17:07] <uhhhhahhhhohahhh> if there was a crazy interaction with a skill and you give the skill 50%, its just 50% better
[2023-01-02 22:17:08] <Angellaps> Isnt' that cause poe is infinitely more complex?
[2023-01-02 22:17:09] <GGZii> PoE Should have 5-6 Core builds you can follow. NPCs give the items, you follow a tree and at the end you have a generic working build for all content.
