[2022-12-18 00:00:50] <%+s0l0ist_> we told you to bring electro (we didnt)
[2022-12-18 00:01:04] <@^StreamElements> Please do not pester the A.I with questions of "Will you pull for X character?" He hardly even knows who he'll pull for himself.

[2022-12-18 00:05:15] <fizzzzzy_pop> Kokomi was my first limited 5 star
[2022-12-18 00:05:22] <M4ydayy> @s0l0ist_ i usually do a team with either a shield (zhongli) or a healer (kuki or jean)
[2022-12-18 00:05:30] <toskamai> Ive never gotten past floor 11 in abyss
[2022-12-18 00:05:31] <omegothic> abyss is hard, not everyone has the patience to beat it, it's okay. i am ar 57 and i got 36* only two times
[2022-12-18 00:05:43] <%+s0l0ist_> my first limited 5 star was kokomi bbut i lost raidens 50/50

[2022-12-18 00:06:41] <M4ydayy> My first 5* was Itto, and then Xiao 14 wishes later
[2022-12-18 00:06:43] <knightworld16> Mona is your Bennett when you don't like bennett
[2022-12-18 00:06:52] <MajesticWolf127> Javas live at a reasonable time?? never thought I'd see the day where he's live during the day
[2022-12-18 00:06:56] <%+s0l0ist_> i dont like bennet
[2022-12-18 00:07:02] <%+s0l0ist_> thats why hes level 50
[2022-12-18 00:07:17] <fizzzzzy_pop> I donr use bennete or Mona
[2022-12-18 00:07:24] <%+s0l0ist_> im out of the "i got this character so im going to level them up" phase

[2022-12-18 00:07:36] <dafaffdg> I dont like Bennett because he took 1 year and a half to come home
[2022-12-18 00:07:41] <M4ydayy> Bennett is so boring to play
[2022-12-18 00:07:43] <xjackx1610> Hello Java and Chat!! :))

[2022-12-18 00:08:04] <%+s0l0ist_> mona would do so much more dmg with him but idc
[2022-12-18 00:08:04] <scaramouchefan101> I love Bennett because he is meta
[2022-12-18 00:08:06] <paulien_2000> Bennet was my first character so i mained him until the end of the inazuma quests
[2022-12-18 00:08:09] <short_miku2> @Migud24 bennett is only good for support and everything else about him is trash
[2022-12-18 00:08:14] <fizzzzzy_pop> I refuse to use bennete unless I get his c6 so I can make people mad
[2022-12-18 00:08:14] <Nex_Error> i still have bennett at lvl 20 on my main bc i don't like him

[2022-12-18 00:10:30] <M4ydayy> I kind of with every enemy with a shield worked like the abyss lectors, they die when the shield goes down

[2022-12-18 00:10:37] <knightworld16> no you can hit the wings to shoot them down
[2022-12-18 00:10:40] <fizzzzzy_pop> I know his play style is so basic I refuse to use him
[2022-12-18 00:10:54] <%+s0l0ist_> ayato because the hydro hypo traumatized me and childe because im petty
[2022-12-18 00:11:04] <@^StreamElements> Do not tell the A.I. to "Pull on X banner". The A.I. will pull if he wants to. You will be muted / banned if you repeatedly do this.
