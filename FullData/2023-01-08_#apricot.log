[2023-01-08 20:08:34] <+WRXKillerGM> @apricot all of your nails grow back as long as there is a little bit left. If you lose your entire nail then it won’t grow back. For example one of my teachers lost their thumbnail and it never came back but I lost half of my toenail and it eventually came back with a scab underneath the toenail
