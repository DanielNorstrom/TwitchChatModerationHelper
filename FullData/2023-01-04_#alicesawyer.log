[2023-01-04 23:20:17] <%sketchyjuli> scarousal huh? havent heard that til now, but pretty sure I know what it feels like
[2023-01-04 23:20:18] <+Plaonultimate> When your favorite h game happens to have a bunch of vore scenes.
[2023-01-04 23:20:19] <@%achievementguy> I remember reading once that fetishes are rooted in some sort of childhood experience most times
[2023-01-04 23:20:23] <%$Jahuak> I wonder if fetishes are related to thing like DNA, so you can blame your parents for giving you a foot fetish allbon1Patchy

[2023-01-04 23:21:35] <tagbarrelstorage> Quentin Tarantino needs to shut up. The only time his foot fetish was mildly entertaining was in Dusk till Dawn for how blatant it was.
[2023-01-04 23:21:36] <%derpaton> I heard somewhere that loli drawing in japanese manga and artwork was a method to get around the censoring laws because the artists didn't have to consor the female form as much

[2023-01-04 23:21:39] <honktowndeluxe> @Jahuak A foot fetish has a plausible biological basis. The areas of feet in the brain are close to genitals.

[2023-01-04 23:38:11] <%$Jahuak> 3D porn is boring, it's a normal everyday occurance and it's bound by wordly limits. Any fantasy porn has not limits, that's what makes it special

[2023-01-04 23:47:05] <%AkiajiMargo> "written like a fanfiction" is still an insult despite knowing multiple fanfic authors with published novels

[2023-01-04 23:47:49] <cockablaze> Fanfic is very outdated, we need more copyright infringing fiction from people that absolutely hate the source material

[2023-01-04 23:49:54] <%Paint2D> Futa is just the peek of human evolution don't think it even counts as a fetish
[2023-01-04 23:49:55] <%supersanttu7> @supersanttu7 and it was the ENTIRE THING
[2023-01-04 23:49:59] <gorillafinn> probably better to nuke the vod
[2023-01-04 23:50:08] <yev_san> i think for futa guys just dont wanna look at the dude, and it makes it easier
[2023-01-04 23:50:28] <+FungKy_B> Just need to check something, The Stars at Night, Are Big and Bright....
[2023-01-04 23:50:34] <%Majkatt> Every time I see futa where the dick is literally the size of the person and is more often being penetrated than penetrating I wonder who it's for
[2023-01-04 23:50:35] <%sketchyjuli> girl and ugly bastard is where its at
[2023-01-04 23:50:36] <%+Vermuth> the best horny fiction i've read is redditors writing slow burn multi-post incest stories and passing them off as real
[2023-01-04 23:50:37] <cockablaze> Can't explain futa on male that way though
[2023-01-04 23:50:40] <%supersanttu7> my hot take is that many fetishes are just transhumanism in a trenchcoat
[2023-01-04 23:50:46] <cockablaze> @Majkatt Horses
[2023-01-04 23:50:54] <Paint2D> there is a lot of that these days
[2023-01-04 23:50:54] <derpaton> Male on futa is gay
[2023-01-04 23:51:01] <Jahuak> It's better to look at a hot girl that a dude, that's why futa with girls only is good, you get the dick for the dicking too. alices18Smug

[2023-01-04 23:51:15] <%ARivalAppears> I think also the presence of the dick is more "honest". You can easily see arousal and completion without having to make up analogues

[2023-01-04 23:53:29] <%Paint2D> yes both is futa
[2023-01-04 23:53:30] <%sketchyjuli> yeah, mostly its just one
[2023-01-04 23:53:31] <resavenida> Is this gonna be a futa with/without balls argument?

[2023-01-04 23:53:35] <honktowndeluxe> It's a word. It's always been a word, not a reference to an exact description
[2023-01-04 23:53:37] <%$Jahuak> Sex is an amazing topic to discuss, so much to talk about and only shame is blocking you alices18Girlboss
[2023-01-04 23:53:40] <Eluvianii> I can't think of anything but I promise I have trauma Alice, empathize with me
[2023-01-04 23:53:41] <%ARivalAppears> I grew up on no ball futa, so I'm biased
[2023-01-04 23:53:41] <ArthurVarc241> I'm more into Milf than futa H-manga
[2023-01-04 23:53:48] <%$Jahuak> Futa ALWAYS with balls
[2023-01-04 23:53:51] <%clovooo> the vaginer replaces the balls
[2023-01-04 23:53:52] <honktowndeluxe> Then the spergs invade and say X means this and Y means that 'reee'
[2023-01-04 23:53:54] <%supersanttu7> "they never end up using both" that sounds like your experience with futa stuff is way too vanilla
[2023-01-04 23:53:57] <AutolycusLive> This chat is giving me trauma
[2023-01-04 23:53:59] <%Majkatt> No balls futa is less gay because less chance of balls touching
[2023-01-04 23:54:06] <honktowndeluxe> cock and balls no vag, anything mixed is really weird to me
[2023-01-04 23:54:09] <+Plaonultimate> What about a fetish where you switch people with their horny dimensional counterparts from another universe?
[2023-01-04 23:54:14] <%tragon_145> can futa be yuri?
[2023-01-04 23:54:15] <%ClosoTezuka> talking about sex = horny alices18What

[2023-01-04 23:54:21] <%supersanttu7> @AutolycusLive you're lucky you missed the guro discussion
[2023-01-04 23:54:23] <%ClosoTezuka> guess my sex ed teacher was a massive horndog!!!!
[2023-01-04 23:54:29] <LordXal> @autolycuslive at least it isn't a hot tub stream with the chat being weirdos
[2023-01-04 23:54:32] <AutolycusLive> LUL
[2023-01-04 23:54:32] <%hectop4scal> something that does annoy me is like. the inistence some people have on the sexual and non-seuxal being strictly delineated
[2023-01-04 23:54:34] <%Paint2D> I honestly don't care
[2023-01-04 23:54:40] <%Paint2D> about balls
[2023-01-04 23:54:42] <%clovooo> But if there's balls theres no reason for the woman parts is there?
[2023-01-04 23:54:46] <cockablaze> the sexual is the political
[2023-01-04 23:54:49] <%clovooo> room* not reason
[2023-01-04 23:54:49] <AutolycusLive> I'm not gonna lie I already feel at home here

[2023-01-04 23:55:14] <honktowndeluxe> @clovooo for what it's worth, there's a strange lack of 'chick with balls' lykalyXe
[2023-01-04 23:55:16] <gorillafinn> @autolycuslive thats the grooming kicking in
[2023-01-04 23:55:18] <%ARivalAppears> @clovooo alices18What Just gonna ignore pregnancy

[2023-01-04 23:55:24] <%denchi__> i feel like no balls makes it less gay, not saying that's better or worse
[2023-01-04 23:55:31] <honktowndeluxe> The Popcorn Factory Sketch is truly enlightening.

[2023-01-04 23:55:38] <%supersanttu7> I've been awake for 20 hours and I stopped feeling tired because of this fascinating conversation
[2023-01-04 23:55:38] <cockablaze> what game is this
[2023-01-04 23:55:42] <%clovooo> Just don't think about it too hard @arivalappears alices18Smug
[2023-01-04 23:55:47] <%hectop4scal> like bringing sexual subject matter into something previously without it makes it something completely different for some reason, that the two can never meet

[2023-01-04 23:56:12] <%$Jahuak> You can't have a dick without balls, where does the semen come from
[2023-01-04 23:56:16] <%Majkatt> balls would be like those curtains on a doorway
[2023-01-04 23:56:19] <%ffwired> For multi-dick setups, should they also have their balls multiplied?
[2023-01-04 23:56:20] <%clovooo> Groose best boy
[2023-01-04 23:56:20] <%Paint2D> to be fair it does get a little crowded if there are balls
[2023-01-04 23:56:27] <%ClosoTezuka> @Jahuak the heart
[2023-01-04 23:56:31] <honktowndeluxe> @Jahuak balls are where the pee is stored, not semen
[2023-01-04 23:56:33] <Eluvianii> I blinked and suddenly Alice is gone and I have a delinquent instead
[2023-01-04 23:56:38] <%supersanttu7> @ffwired the cock-dra?
