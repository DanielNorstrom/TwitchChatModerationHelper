[2023-01-01 07:25:35] <!%Refugeek> the idea is to have a 5 sec teaser and then the 5 sec intro to seperate it from the real start.. but I agree long intros are probably a bad idea

[2023-01-01 13:29:23] <!%$WrathOfCathy> do you ever think that good players have a different kind of fun than bad players? sometimes I feel like the level of unfun is exaggerated because of how long people play and how good they are
