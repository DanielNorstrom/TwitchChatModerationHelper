[2022-12-08 14:24:07] <%hatyr_> i really like going back to ds3, bb, and sekiro. sometimes you just wanna sit down and bust out a run. i can't do that with ER
[2022-12-08 14:24:13] <guyinaring> @ErrSousa very fun
[2022-12-08 14:24:14] <ta_no_kami> it's the fromsoft game I played the most, enjoyed the most with friends (mostly thanks to the seamless coop). As for content I liked watching first blind runs, and some challenge runs. I feel it won't be as effective for content for mods/randos as dark souls, probably because it's too big to be enjoyable

[2022-12-08 14:24:40] <+ecstasy_in_service> I have seen lag issues but not all the time, if you like PVP then you'll have fun
[2022-12-08 14:24:53] <%ErrSousa> I feel like from needed to do something with the pvp, it always felt underwhelming to me. This ads more depth to it so i think i'll try it

[2022-12-08 14:27:21] <%OttoPhil> it's just tough when the setup is more of the playthrough, so to ppl who love souls battles it goes arwy

[2022-12-08 14:27:53] <JohnVeloc> DS1 is great, DS3 as well. DS2 repels me even though I did watch slow runs of it and played through several times.  ER is ambiguous. If run setup is too slow it repels me

[2022-12-08 14:29:53] <JohnVeloc> @Sarah88_66 I recommend punishing only specific weapon combo in first phase. You can outrun most of the attacks from range.
[2022-12-08 14:30:00] <%LankSSBM> any solution for the flame of redmanes nerf?
[2022-12-08 14:30:36] <@%a_chu> what was you wanted to change?
[2022-12-08 14:30:43] <FelidaeSocialis> @Sarah88_66 Best way to deal would be just run away during his curved sword and lance phase and wait it out
[2022-12-08 14:30:47] <JohnVeloc> @Sarah88_66 lance has 1 or 2 punishable attacks. For Pyro phase... Just wait it out or try to get a hit or two after each swip

As the lizard walks away a crocodile in the river nearby spots them and comes over to see what's going on. He goes to the tree, looks up, and says "Hey monkey!". The monkey looks down and says "DUDE / / How much freakin water did you drink?!?"

[2022-12-08 18:17:15] <old_raspy> Does it depend on game variety mix? Eg. Soulslikes might not cause so much of a drop?

[2022-12-08 18:17:36] <Zormi> I dont think Ela has a gamer firdge so does he really know what hes talking about ?

[2022-12-08 18:18:12] <%Natural_Champs> @Zormi The problem is that Nico needs Mountain Dew in the fridge, not Pepsi
[2022-12-08 18:18:23] <Zormi> Yeah thats very true
[2022-12-08 18:18:44] <%Scritoon> It depends on what you play. But 50% is a fair assessment. If you roughly pay attention to viewer numbers for larger streamers then you can easily see it cuteNODDERS
[2022-12-08 18:18:47] <%elephancyy> I think half sounds about right, frequently watch Dist as well and when he plays variety its always half or even less

[2022-12-08 18:20:09] <%Scritoon> Well I mean Ela is the perfect example. He is usually in the 6-8K range. But if he boots up DS1 speedruns he jumps up to 12-13K cuteNODDERS
[2022-12-08 18:20:24] <Vulfe> I love both games.....  BUT
[2022-12-08 18:20:33] <%Destroyerb3> that's the thing tho, what I've heard from streamers that managed to transition from a specific game to variety is that you need to stick with it even if at the start the views are low. ofc in your position that's hard since this is your livelihood
[2022-12-08 18:20:58] <hemiak> ER is a lot of riding around to go get stuff in different areas. It just isn’t as interesting to me.

[2022-12-08 18:21:27] <+torresedoc1996> i prefer ds III
