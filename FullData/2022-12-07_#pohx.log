[2022-12-07 17:50:38] <%Divio> it's very light flavor for Turkish delight
[2022-12-07 17:50:41] <melodicarc> They have different flavours not just rose, you can find several flavours, it's chewy but not sticky like jelly. it's super soft and breaks apart easily in the mouth.
[2022-12-07 17:50:42] <hottunas> Turkish delight or lokum is a family of confections based on a gel of starch and sugar.

[2022-12-07 18:09:06] <%+palmermarc> @Xuletz I run HFT instead of flame wall, personally
[2022-12-07 18:09:22] <%+palmermarc> @Doc_Leisure yes, check the site

[2022-12-07 18:09:36] <%Xuletz> @palmermarc but you clear with magma orb right?
[2022-12-07 18:09:36] <$Doc_Leisure> @palmermarc thx
[2022-12-07 18:09:41] <%Laernas> I remember that blockbuster had chance to buy Netflix and they refused it :D welp
[2022-12-07 18:09:42] <%+palmermarc> @Xuletz Rolling Magma
[2022-12-07 18:09:46] <%lemoncoolers> HFT is pretty low dmg past like lvl 10 he's right
[2022-12-07 18:09:48] <%Xuletz> same thing
[2022-12-07 18:09:50] <%lemoncoolers> magma is much better
[2022-12-07 18:10:00] <+ClayDunester> i hate maven cuz i have shit memory
[2022-12-07 18:10:00] <%Xuletz> but yeah my point was that it sucks for clearing
[2022-12-07 18:10:05] <spooper_trooper> arena control is a big thing on maven
[2022-12-07 18:10:08] <sirgregoryadams> @Xuletz HFT is good to just have as a source of consecrated ground to run over every now and then
[2022-12-07 18:10:08] <ShibaWaves> wasn't that maven fight like 10 mins? KEKW

[2022-12-07 18:10:46] <+fatheals_> @Xuletz You're only using magma up to 40ish, and you don't need to "clear", you just need to kill what you need to kill while running through zones for appropriate xp. You shouldn't be killing everything for optimal leveling, but if you intend on clearing everything you see rolling magma would be horrible yes.

[2022-12-07 18:11:56] <+Naxx1981> I find when its time to min max switching to awakened empower and dropping swift affliction is nice u can then drop dex go marble ammy and u get more dps
[2022-12-07 18:12:00] <%Xuletz> @fatheals_ lvl 34 actually, and you do need to clear. play the game with heavy strike and tell me with a straight face you don't miss a clear skill
[2022-12-07 18:12:02] <sirgregoryadams> @Xuletz I mean, depends on how much you care about "optimal" leveling...
[2022-12-07 18:12:05] <%+palmermarc> Would a PoE Leveling string be helpful? It's a step-by-step leveling guide where you can select the gems as well. I'm making one now for myself. IDK if it's helpful for everyone though

[2022-12-07 18:12:15] <%Thyrandaal> why does the itemlevel of the belt matter in this card?
[2022-12-07 18:12:16] <hottunas> @vietbeo2212 it's also a 2% life on kill if youve spent life, life tap on shield charge means you always spend life, so it's regen for maps with no regen too
[2022-12-07 18:12:32] <artnoc73> I leveled my cyclone built with shatter steel and it destroyed until cyclone was good enough dmg
[2022-12-07 18:12:32] <melodicarc> You should check Rue's vod from yesterday INSANECAT his chat was bullying him all stream CATW

[2022-12-07 18:12:57] <%+palmermarc> Yup
[2022-12-07 18:12:59] <+fatheals_> @Xuletz I don't really kill anything in the campaign unless absolutely necessary i.e. large packs/blues, so it doesn't bother me much regardless. My goal is to run straight through the zone and ignore everything unless I absolutely have to kill it.
[2022-12-07 18:12:59] <ikorack> @Thyrandaal some corruption implicits are ilevel gated
[2022-12-07 18:12:59] <hottunas> yeh it's pretty cool
[2022-12-07 18:13:00] <%Zerograviti> Guys, we got Fracturing Shards, those are definitely worth more than Divine Shards, believe me
[2022-12-07 18:13:05] <%+palmermarc> Oh okay, cool., I've had a few impromptu meetings
[2022-12-07 18:13:07] <ShibaWaves> is that the new atlas tree?
[2022-12-07 18:13:08] <%Thyrandaal> @ikorack ty!
[2022-12-07 18:13:29] <melodicarc> @ShibaWaves No new atlas tree comes out 1-2 hours before league start
[2022-12-07 18:13:39] <ShibaWaves> @melodicarc ah ok ty
[2022-12-07 18:13:39] <vietbeo2212> @hottunas hmm that's new
[2022-12-07 18:13:48] <%Xuletz> @fatheals_ you still need to clear to keep up quicksilver you're being a bit weird rn

[2022-12-07 18:14:01] <hottunas> @vietbeo2212 I noticed it the other day, looked interesting
[2022-12-07 18:14:02] <vietbeo2212> For me
[2022-12-07 18:14:05] <Mirakakel> Youre nice
[2022-12-07 18:14:05] <spooper_trooper> I think most people are predisposed to being nice
[2022-12-07 18:14:11] <meowmeoww666> if you are not nice then who are for me
[2022-12-07 18:14:11] <spooper_trooper> not always kind, but definitely nice
[2022-12-07 18:14:12] <artnoc73> If you're not considered a nice streamer, then the world is burning faster than I thought
[2022-12-07 18:14:19] <melodicarc> @Pohx it's because he is denying that he is a cat even though he obviously is a cat so therefore until he admits he is a cat we bully him and call him a cat Kappa
[2022-12-07 18:14:20] <%+Jesuscametwice> @Pohx question for the ilvl4 sceptre strat is there a reason we go ilvl4 if +1 spawns on ilvl2?
[2022-12-07 18:14:30] <+fatheals_> @Xuletz I feel like you're severely overexaggerating the amount of monsters you actually need to kill, or how long it takes to do so with virtually any skill in the game. :P
[2022-12-07 18:14:33] <Riqimaru01> yo Mr Pohx. Will RF Jugg be able to kill Uber Sirus eventually?

[2022-12-07 18:15:13] <%Xuletz> @fatheals_ I think it's you who equate clear skill with killing every single mob in the zone which is not the case

[2022-12-07 18:15:39] <Shogun1922> so bit of a strange question since you play very close to enemies, do you think the changes to Ylfeban's Trickery and the hex master keystone would be good for melee? or is that too much of a stretch?
