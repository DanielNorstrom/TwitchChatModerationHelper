[2023-01-07 00:01:57] <DareLite> @Baker i just saw they added power pass for money.. so.. would you say its a viable idea for me to completely focus on just doing my achievment completions, and just buying a pass when slayer comes out? cause id rather do that tbh

[2023-01-07 00:07:16] <DareLite> @Baker  i honestly didnt play the game in so long, id rather just go back and do stuff while im working, cause i have a job that is basically 85% free time, so ye
[2023-01-07 00:08:14] <MRxVIKO> imagine slayer comes out with akkan in our regions
