[2023-01-01 07:22:12] <%UndeadLeech> Could maybe allow punching only for aggro if you need it?
[2023-01-01 07:22:16] <%douglascoding> shields are cracked in this game
[2023-01-01 07:22:37] <%MadKingHyperion> there was some mod that mitch used months ago that allowed him to switch mods during boss fights
[2023-01-01 07:22:43] <%+gleefulgm> why does margit arena looks like its in 2x speed
[2023-01-01 07:22:46] <+timmytissue> just smack people with the jelly shield

[2023-01-01 07:23:44] <+Devinguy> @gleefulgm it's probably not rendering it in full until you step in so it looks weird
[2023-01-01 07:23:50] <%UndeadLeech> Resummoning the same summon multiple times seems like it should be a simple mod to write.
[2023-01-01 07:24:09] <%FelidaeSocialis> This is gonna be awful later on
[2023-01-01 07:24:13] <+TubOfPopcorn> How about using a different summon to kill each boss

[2023-01-01 07:24:42] <VGTimis> Does jellyfish summon deal poison?
[2023-01-01 07:24:44] <%MadKingHyperion> that mod that mitch used isnt updated for 1.08, but there is a mod that gives spirit summons hp regen and can be summoned in more areas

[2023-01-01 07:25:42] <%thefifthmatt> yeah a bunch of things may be possible but must be done individually for each summon spot

[2023-01-01 07:30:01] <%asanunasa> that's only for multiple players no? the boss scaling
[2023-01-01 07:30:07] <%MadKingHyperion> i thought they only got the increased scaling from the gold signs before the fogwall
[2023-01-01 07:30:07] <@%^Nightbot> Follow the channel and make me the next pokimane
[2023-01-01 07:30:10] <+Devinguy> ashes arent the same as summons i dont think
[2023-01-01 07:30:32] <%asanunasa> yeah
[2023-01-01 07:30:35] <%BigPissser> they dont get extra stats from spirit ashes
[2023-01-01 07:30:36] <%UndeadLeech> I mean you can summon after the fight started, so it wouldn't make sense?
[2023-01-01 07:30:43] <JetKur0> her name is Aurelia
[2023-01-01 07:30:47] <%MadKingHyperion> you can kill this guy with summons at that spot
[2023-01-01 07:30:47] <+Devinguy> i dont think spirits increase health because you summon them during the boss fight not before
[2023-01-01 07:30:49] <+Dekharen> bosses dont get scaling from spirit summons
[2023-01-01 07:30:54] <%FelidaeSocialis> Ashes doesn't buff boss
[2023-01-01 07:30:55] <%MadKingHyperion> it will start to fade if you go closer to him

[2023-01-01 07:32:39] <%FelidaeSocialis> Also you can't use summon ash in Radahn fight
[2023-01-01 07:32:41] <%thefifthmatt> you can at least probably start with "Unlocked Spirit Ashes" mod

[2023-01-01 07:36:01] <%thefifthmatt> but it seems like it makes the kinds of edits I would make
[2023-01-01 07:36:16] <French_Cyndaquil> 1 stamina, 1 hp, every other stat at 0 (except equip load)
[2023-01-01 07:36:20] <%BigPissser> cant do elden beast, it can be poisoned or parried, and the ring attack locks onto the player/summons 3 times in a row. Even if the jellyfish could survive one ring attack (or two with the protection physick) theres no way you could draw agro for the entire three rings. and thats not even including the fact that elden beast also has like twenty other moves that do MORE damage and are HARDER to dodge for a summon with no i-frames. This run is a waste of time imo
[2023-01-01 07:36:30] <%BigPissser> oh yeah its essay time

[2023-01-01 07:38:04] <%BigPissser> i think a blindfold run would be way more fun than this run honestly
[2023-01-01 07:38:05] <%UndeadLeech> Feels like the better choice would be doing fun runs not difficult runs.
[2023-01-01 07:38:14] <+Dekharen> maybe different boss weapons ? They don't get any love but some of them are quite fun. If you limit the level it could turn nice
[2023-01-01 07:38:35] <%FelidaeSocialis> But isn't summon only where you can re-summon kinda boring? You have to just keep running away and keep on summoning it until boss dead?
[2023-01-01 07:38:44] <+Dekharen> Can't wait to see that one :D
[2023-01-01 07:38:46] <%UndeadLeech> Sounds like a great idea.
[2023-01-01 07:38:47] <%pink_noizz> why jellyfish only? why not other fun spirit ashes as well ?
[2023-01-01 07:38:48] <%Martin_Lutter> Coño, i found the Alt Code for ñ.
[2023-01-01 07:38:53] <%asanunasa> beating each area with it's respective boss weapon could be cool

[2023-01-01 07:39:06] <%+TheDarkLordSauronHimself> elden ring with permanent rot?

[2023-01-01 07:39:24] <+Dekharen> Yep but you should also use one of these mods that allow you to have better scaling for stats to have enough mind/hp
[2023-01-01 07:39:24] <%BigPissser> i mean yall know how I feel about this run already LUL
[2023-01-01 07:39:28] <%+gleefulgm> incants only run?
[2023-01-01 07:39:33] <+The_Professor_Grant> So when you mean jellyfish only what is it?
[2023-01-01 07:39:38] <%devonoconde> New headphones ain? Okayge
[2023-01-01 07:39:46] <%FelidaeSocialis> Kicking is far more impressive
[2023-01-01 07:39:47] <%UndeadLeech> I think limited FP is a good thing though? Wouldn't be fun if you could just resummon infinitely?
[2023-01-01 07:39:55] <+The_Professor_Grant> This sounds terrible dont do it ain
[2023-01-01 07:39:56] <+Dekharen> and/or give yourself the fp regen stars

[2023-01-01 07:40:41] <%+TheDarkLordSauronHimself> elden ring with starting weapon,armor and lv1?
[2023-01-01 07:40:49] <%BigPissser> kick was theoretically possible, this run is ACTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE

[2023-01-01 08:50:21] <Nifran> blindfold run would be dumb, aren't there decent mods to make the game more difficult?

[2023-01-01 09:06:53] <campingforsouls> use a bleed summon to win is you have a bleed summon
[2023-01-01 09:06:59] <%MadKingHyperion> probably not being poisoned fast enough
[2023-01-01 09:07:04] <%+gleefulgm> this is possible

It is one of the few known cases of animals capable of reverting completely to a sexually immature, colonial stage after having reached sexual maturity as a solitary individual. scientists from Israel are studying the jellyfish abilities in order to understand better the  "immortality mechanism"

[2023-01-01 10:23:59] <%+LangleyTerra> It is a medium shield without a special AoW parry, the parry window on it is garbage.
[2023-01-01 10:24:01] <edalo> can elden beast be poisoned?

[2023-01-01 11:30:46] <omaewamoushindeiruu> Tarring and feathering is a form of public torture and punishment used to enforce unofficial justice or revenge. It was used in feudal Europe and its colonies in the early modern period, as well as the early American frontier, mostly as a type of mob vengeance.

[2023-01-01 11:45:14] <%trasdasyu> Best moment was chip. No question
[2023-01-01 11:45:18] <%MadKingHyperion> best moment was probably when i first spoke in chat

[2023-01-01 11:45:30] <%OkWhat3v3r> I think getting the AR run after the run dying thrice at Malenia was kinda hype.
