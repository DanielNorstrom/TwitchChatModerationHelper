[2023-01-09 07:52:39] <@%Skarthe> Uhh... I think your game audio is super crackly for some reason?
[2023-01-09 07:52:42] <@%Skarthe> Or is that just me?
[2023-01-09 07:52:44] <+Endithinks> Palom? Porom? Nice homage there
[2023-01-09 07:52:53] <%+Hyperstryke> No, it's crackly.
[2023-01-09 07:53:06] <@%Skarthe> Your voice sounds fine but your game audio got crackly during that battle I think
[2023-01-09 07:53:11] <+Endithinks> I've had this game on my playstation and just never got around to it. Maybe I will give it a shot.
[2023-01-09 07:53:20] <@%Skarthe> No, it's still crackly
[2023-01-09 07:53:29] <@%Skarthe> More just "it hasn't been this way all stream, it started recently"
