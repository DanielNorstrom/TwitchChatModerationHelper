[2023-01-04 19:49:28] <Mr_Early_Ghost> Regarding the whole flagging thing... I do think there's a difference of perspectives as to what chess is and what is acceptable and/or disrespectful. Jobava, for instance, thinks flagging is a bad thing to do. Naroditsky thinks you got to do what you got to do. To each his own.

[2023-01-04 20:58:27] <%Aarget> playing piano in a suit jacket is difficult imagine trying to reach across a chess board it's just so pointless

[2023-01-04 22:10:22] <%anurag10x> @asap_steve You. You have more viewers than hikaru. good job
[2023-01-04 22:10:26] BAN: anurag10x (310s)
[2023-01-04 22:10:29] <%Pause2Reflect> @luckchaos That's the draw of stars / best performers, including Hikaru and Magnus. Many more total users will be drawn to Twitch if Magnus keeps streaming, which is good for Hikaru too.

[2023-01-04 22:12:33] <%Pause2Reflect> @WanderingBishop Agree. That's tedious. We watched when they weren't playing each other and we'll keep watching. That stuff will die down if Magnus streams regularly.
