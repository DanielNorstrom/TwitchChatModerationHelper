[2022-12-12 00:03:05] <@%^StreamElements> This character has bonus area at low levels, so the rune tracer is huge. It gets stuck on the furniture in this specific spot and covers Cirno's hitbox so he can never get hit. The reaper will spawn with 1.3 million HP because Cirno is at a low level. Before the reaper can attack Cirno picks up the xp to get items and hopefully kill the reaper.  Yes, hyper mode is on.
[2022-12-12 00:03:06] <@%^StreamElements> By activating Ripper Mode and Blade Mode, while pushing down L3 to be able to walk, time slows down enough for you to make it through the door before the barrier can stop you.

[2022-12-12 02:27:27] <%Houdini111> @DRKO_ If you use a phone (any phone) for tracking then the tracking is done on the phone and then the model is rendered to that tracking on the computer. No GPU savings. If you use a webcam then your computer has to figure out where your face is, which costs CPU power. iPhone vs Android tracking is just about fancy face tracking but, as cirno said, if you have an RTX GPU and use webcam tracking you can get most of the way there now and that tracking work is largely offloaded to the GPU as well.

[2022-12-12 02:48:01] <@%Duo11> @Holomyth_Takomancer its really a technology that will be powerful in the future because it lets you do super complicated lighting calculations basically automatically without the devs having to do anything, but for right now its too much of a resource sink, IMO OhISee
[2022-12-12 02:48:33] <%Illylia> I'll have to look for them then. It was a thought I had when I was trying to watch the first DF stream. cirISee

[2022-12-12 02:49:05] <%NeoQuixotic> Ray tracing has always been a thing. Just was never possible realtime until now

[2022-12-12 02:49:20] <%possimpible_> industry is not gonna let raytracing go. There is a reason why it was called "holy grail"
[2022-12-12 02:49:20] <%+Gelil> The RC car thing they showed was really cool
[2022-12-12 02:49:29] <@%+SilverSonic> there's also many types of ray tracing
[2022-12-12 02:49:37] <@%+SilverSonic> from reflections to lighting to AO etc

[2022-12-12 14:39:35] <%TheGHA> random selection of the best possible locations is working Daijoubu
[2022-12-12 14:41:18] <%TheGHA> is a for loop not just a while loop with two extra build in lines, one line that is done at the start (often int i = 0) and one that is done each loop at the end (often i++)
[2022-12-12 14:41:53] <@%Toonfish> well depends on the language but mostly yes
[2022-12-12 14:43:06] <@%Toonfish> in some languages (like python), a foor loop creates an iterator - an object that looks at an iterable object like a list and, when prompted gives the next element of that iterable object

[2022-12-12 22:15:47] <!%+kevach> they have a one page pdf that says the following: Intense sexual need causes brainstrike (unconscious, partial amnesia). Brainstrike causes sexual stupidity (unconscious inability to think correctly). Sex is not the only supwan (supremely wonderful experience). One supwan is as good as another. And God promises supwan to anyone who respects him above all else and does what is right.

[2022-12-12 23:16:27] <steallreyvn> I lost 40 dwarves last night due to a 'were-infection'. I didn't realize until 6 dwarves transformed into were-geckos and starting killing their own people. So I managed to quarantine them, and anyone would was hurt by them into the hospital. I sealed them in and waited a month for them to transform and kill anyone in the hospital not infected. Once they transformed back, I exiled the remaining 3 dwarves. Of which, was my Militia commander, my Hammerer, and a Militia Captain. LUL

You scroll up to stop the chat elevator and read the pasta, indulging in its delights... Furthermore, you soon realize that this pasta conveys no information nor is particularly witty or funny. Nevertheless, you drag your mouse across, hit Ctrl+C, then Ctrl+V and press Enter.
