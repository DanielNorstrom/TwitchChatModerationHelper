[2023-01-03 15:44:00] <sweg53> i have 5 minutes, but i get annoyed and i turn it off completely, and i sleep another hour
[2023-01-03 15:44:02] <+SantaTim> WideArrive
[2023-01-03 15:44:03] <%Loftwingz> put your phone in the bathroom and set the alarm volume on max
[2023-01-03 15:44:04] <%sixty9pixels> unbind the snooze dings
[2023-01-03 15:44:04] <%Silver_star12> I have a snus in me atm lol
[2023-01-03 15:44:09] <%StantonCree_> Try putting the alarm earlier so your 3rd snooze is earlier

[2023-01-03 15:44:42] <%Jeddix> just pretend that you are a regular employee and you have to get up LUL
[2023-01-03 15:44:47] <%Marenti> put your alarm on the opposite side of the room, so you need to get out of bed?
[2023-01-03 15:44:52] <%Silver_star12> You got the Cupra map?
[2023-01-03 15:44:55] <bretti01> snoozing is bad for your brain because it gets confused whether it is time to get up or not..in the end it just makes you more tired than getting up after the first alarm
[2023-01-03 15:44:56] <+EkczSalsa> xpp
[2023-01-03 15:45:02] <%Marenti> xdd
[2023-01-03 15:45:10] <CoolReal> There's an app that only shuts off the alarm after you scan a QR code, just put a QR code in buttfuck nowhere so you have to get up and walk
[2023-01-03 15:45:21] <+remessis_> your brain learned that alarm clock = sleep a bit more, try to sleep for 10 minutes and if you hear an alarm do something right away and do that many times and maybe youll do it automatically
[2023-01-03 15:45:39] <+Scorchius> what if you lose the barcode?

[2023-01-03 15:45:56] <%jonibravo0o> best thing to do is not leave your phone by the bed so you have to get up to turn off the alarm or press snooze
[2023-01-03 15:46:06] <SSanoLIVE> train it
[2023-01-03 15:46:10] <%stevechampagne> have a word with him

[2023-01-03 18:25:31] <%+iceemd> Really? I'm new to the community but I wouldn't have guessed pure tech in your past
[2023-01-03 18:25:36] <HeraldziK> Deska was only building very good/good dirt maps or also he was a good dirt driver?
[2023-01-03 18:25:48] <InsaniityTM> Deska always been a really good dirt player
[2023-01-03 18:25:52] <%+iceemd> oh yeah right, that makes sense!
[2023-01-03 18:25:54] <%+PizzleGG> it helps to be a good driver to make good maps
[2023-01-03 18:26:19] <+Flyntz_TM> @pizzlegg I’m a bad driver and build bad maps
[2023-01-03 18:26:37] <%+PizzleGG> @Flyntz_TM TrollDespair
[2023-01-03 18:26:38] <%+iceemd> I didn't mean judging by your skill obviously - it's just that from watching streams I get the feeling you enjoy variety maps especially some dirt and grass thrown in the mix
[2023-01-03 18:26:41] <%Raveout> @PizzleGG being good is quite essential to really be good at mapping (for routes at least)
[2023-01-03 18:26:43] <LaSalieree> @PizzleGG keissla is not that good of a driver xdd

[2023-01-03 18:28:18] <Tigui0> do you think competition maps should go back to full tech or its a good thing that its mixed maps  Hmmm
[2023-01-03 18:28:28] <@%CuriousPolymath> flat ice and bobsled are very different styles as well NODDERS
[2023-01-03 18:28:32] <koomahxdd> plastic is the newest Madge

[2023-01-03 18:28:45] <%johnara2002> plastic is super fun tho ice its TrollDespair
[2023-01-03 18:28:53] <%Raveout> good mixed maps are the way to go imo

[2023-01-03 18:47:16] <@^StreamElements> Back at it again with some 'Track of the Day' author hunting. Check out !medals to see the most difficult author medals in the campaign and my personal best on !midori - Before you ask, https://www.author-tracker.com uses a different medal for Midori compared to the ingame one. The goal is to just gather the available ones slow and steadily.

Check out !medals to see the most difficult author medals in the campaign and my personal best on !midori - Before you ask, https://www.author-tracker.com uses a different medal for Midori compared to the ingame one. The goal is to just gather the available ones slow and steadily.
