[2022-12-28 16:31:12] <belfastcl> seasonal passes are a great way of getting people to log in
[2022-12-28 16:31:57] <%DetroitTaxman> When you buy the season pass you get a lot of premiuum rewards too like shaders, upgrade mats etc
[2022-12-28 16:32:03] <%NebTex_> That‚Äôs such a good term for them lol
[2022-12-28 16:32:23] <+SSehf> There‚Äôs rumors of bungie removing the seasonal model with light fall

[2022-12-28 16:32:34] <+LBenson00> Can you pay to progress through the pass faster? On games like Fortnite for example there‚Äôs a free one and a paid one and if you don‚Äôt pay you only get like 10% of the rewards
[2022-12-28 16:32:52] <%cptBlackbill> The DLCs in ESO is sort of like a season pass?
[2022-12-28 16:32:53] <%DetroitTaxman> yes @LBenson00 therea re two passes
[2022-12-28 16:33:02] <TanukiNym> So if they did that would ESO+ give you access or would you have to buy it along with ESO+ in a perfect world?

[2022-12-28 17:43:36] <%booch31> @ASilv3rFox Yeah, but then you throw that into scenarios like CR where the boss teleports and you can keep your HA up more then a "tuned" DPS build with dual wield/two handed.  Or something like DSR Turtle/AA where you're doing constant crazy lightning cleave and it's just tearing up anything involving LA weaving.

[2022-12-28 17:44:46] <%booch31> If they adjusted Empower to like 20% Light Attack, 70% Heavy Attack damage that might work... but knowing them, they won't do a change that minor.

[2022-12-28 19:01:14] <%+red_fifteen> i believe that "Pay to Win" is more of a spectrum with the play for endgame being at the high end and pay for convenience on the low end

[2022-12-28 19:28:47] <+tickl3d_pickl3> ESO needs to allow us to do group duels up to 6v6 and we can have guild v guild fights in our homes
[2022-12-28 19:29:07] <+ASilv3rFox> The fact is they will put more resources, time and effort into the moneymaker which is PVE

[2022-12-28 19:59:46] <+mpmfrans> Is it possible to run Mara's Balm on the back-bar? Then I will not have the 5 piece stat always active..

[2022-12-28 20:00:10] <@%+brockhoeft1991> @mpmfrans yes there is
[2022-12-28 20:01:04] <+mpmfrans> @brockhoeft1991 But then I wont have the cleanse heal when on front-bar?
[2022-12-28 20:01:16] <%+PlagueSD> @mpmfrans that's pretty common for pvp, have a survival 5pc on back bar and dps 5pc on front.

[2022-12-28 20:24:32] <+HolePawnchLeaf> as a F2P, this stream is cool to see. I'm about 700 hrs in, at cp 400-ish, I would say about 20% of that time was dancing around the limited inventory with no craft bag. If I didn't get in with a good guild trader, I would be substantially further behind. Cool to see someone more knowledgeable about the game tackle it more efficiently :)

[2022-12-28 21:16:05] <%theirishgeeza> what's the difference when you run front bar back bar sets... rather than run jewels and weapons and a set and monster etc?
[2022-12-28 21:17:16] <%+Stingbeetle> @theirishgeeza it completes 2 complete sets and add their bonuses

[2022-12-28 21:46:32] <+TweedleDub> just remember twitch has pretty much zero discoverability, so you HAVE to use other platforms to drive viewers to twitch (which kind of sucks but is what it is)

You'll need Intel 12th and 13th Gen Core CPUs and Ryzen 7000 series CPUs which aren't cheap and then you need to cool them with a radiator (AIO), then PSU, GPU.... that's not on the cheap my man lolz
