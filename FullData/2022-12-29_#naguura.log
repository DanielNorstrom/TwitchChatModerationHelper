[2022-12-29 13:14:55] <Navallax> @Naguura is it always priority to stellar flare instead of starfire, regardless of nº of mobs? or at some point you rather just starfire?

[2022-12-29 14:33:48] <+violinvoid> youre really light weight so you prolly wont have back pain.  my girl never gets it.. im 280lbs tho so every chair hurts my back lol
[2022-12-29 14:33:50] <+Dinge220> if you want a cheap and ergonomic chair go for an office chair not a gaming chair
[2022-12-29 14:33:54] <kiidaa93> no chair will avoid back pain. everyone has to do a bit sport

[2022-12-29 15:28:51] <Blightrose> Hey @Naguura I have a question regarding RWF. Liquid viewers main watched on Max' stream whereas Echo viewers mainly watched on the Echo main channel with the casters. Why do you think this is ? just a cultural thing ?
[2022-12-29 15:28:51] <%nevernude1> This new crafting hurts my brain cell
[2022-12-29 15:29:09] <%Tareah> @popCatter that's why we have Naguura and Kuroz .. they do this amazing stuff and share with us

[2022-12-29 15:31:56] <+michaelbluth> don't get mad at him, he literally has "brogamer" in his name
[2022-12-29 15:31:56] <+Doctor3_> asmongold isn't a wow streamer, hes a drama streamer and plays a lot of wow

[2022-12-29 15:32:38] <+Kipo14> Also Echo are really serious during pull and downtime and Liquid are a lot more Goofy that is the reason why I love watching Max the bits are awesome.
[2022-12-29 15:32:42] <+doublemeatpalace> I think Max also does better content than Scripe does as individuals
[2022-12-29 15:32:53] <+Banjo586> big number gooder yes
[2022-12-29 15:32:58] <+michaelbluth> @doublemeatpalace ya max is very entertaining
[2022-12-29 15:32:59] <irakem> has more viewers, must be the better stream YEP
[2022-12-29 15:33:01] <oliver91919191> @jimzyzbrogamer yes, that was back then, now he plays all big new releases aswell, mostly RPG's and other mmorpgs

[2022-12-29 15:33:11] <Blightrose> big numbers is good for sure, that was my own thoughts
[2022-12-29 15:33:11] <Speshulist> numbers come from FOMO.  More people = more ways to "miss out" on something

[2022-12-29 15:33:16] <ravachol79> I dont know abvout the liquid stream but i tend to choose to watch a streamer ratrer having to cope with some of the casters abnoxious screaming
[2022-12-29 15:33:16] <+myrdingar> I just think Max is a very likeable person. And i don't like commantary while watching video games
[2022-12-29 15:33:19] <%Tareah> i watched Naguura when She was being a Caster personally
[2022-12-29 15:33:24] <%Tareah> cause best Cater
[2022-12-29 15:33:24] <Viso3000> i watched naowh stream for the rwf, love this dude!
[2022-12-29 15:33:26] <%Tareah> caster
[2022-12-29 15:33:27] <qybli> Often Echo's coms are muted anyway during last boss :D
[2022-12-29 15:33:28] <Mulictz> I think max was also live before the liquid channel was so he already had more momentum
[2022-12-29 15:33:46] <KohioDotA2> they also seem to tilt easier no?
[2022-12-29 15:33:53] <skotyven> echo had so much ads, i just could not stand it
[2022-12-29 15:34:05] <sniffsc> I think production wise both big channels were really good, but casters can have a lot of preference
[2022-12-29 15:34:10] <+rsn_uncle_willie> did i make a mistake crafting my chest i feel like i wasted materials
[2022-12-29 15:34:11] <%afishinsea> @tareah same naguura has bissy insights
[2022-12-29 15:34:26] <%nevernude1> I think some of the streams also get a big chunk of viewers from embedded streams
[2022-12-29 15:34:29] <+meattmeatt> im glad fragnance at least got third with method, i like watching me some dh movement
[2022-12-29 15:34:30] <tchervychek> comms among people speaking the same mother language tend to be funnier as well imo
[2022-12-29 15:34:31] <maddershunt> watch the main echo stream for tettles being a fool
[2022-12-29 15:34:52] <+Ithelian> It's a difference between EU and american group attitide tbh, eu gtoups even if all friends have that more 'toxic' vibe? more sarcasm etc maybe

[2022-12-29 15:35:03] <+Goodnevi1> preach makes a big difference too, echos numbers go up when he is casting

[2022-12-29 15:35:59] <+meattmeatt> yea jeathe was actually dope to listen to during rwf
[2022-12-29 15:36:01] <+Banjo586> when english isn't your main language it always sounds more serious

[2022-12-29 15:36:08] <Milenkan> I enjoy the "team" channels to get the overall updates on how the RWF is going, but do like the vibe a solo streamer/player has for overall viewing expereience
[2022-12-29 15:36:10] <%slavenhausen> its that german humor
[2022-12-29 15:36:14] <sniffsc> Yes the Jeath 'analist' was good, I think liquid will also try to do that

[2022-12-29 15:38:38] <Speshulist> All EU talks about is "NA xxx" where X is you did something wrong.  I think that's what people think
[2022-12-29 15:38:44] <KohioDotA2> Naguura = Toxic confirmed!
[2022-12-29 15:38:49] <R0W2> you know when someone from NA flames you, because its unoriginal and boring smh
[2022-12-29 15:39:06] <%+devilwench> I would say that EU is more serious and US is more casual as a broad generalization (US person now living in UK)
[2022-12-29 15:39:16] VIEWERS: 3 657
[2022-12-29 15:39:17] <+doomkry> it also depends on what ppl consider to be toxic or not
[2022-12-29 15:39:18] <+bound006> I feel like NA in general is more casual
[2022-12-29 15:39:19] <@%Kuroz> dippindots made you ban dratnos day 1 in poetry club
[2022-12-29 15:39:22] <PoggestofChampions> NA too busy walking on the moon to be toxic EZ
[2022-12-29 15:39:23] <@%Kuroz> so toxic
[2022-12-29 15:39:24] <+Forkyx> So many different monotone accents make EU people sound more toxic
[2022-12-29 15:39:27] <sniffsc> I doubt there is a significant difference

[2022-12-29 15:39:57] <somsong123> could you show me your talents playing now on M+
[2022-12-29 15:39:57] <Mr_Underpants> I feel like NA tends to talk about NA vs EU more, and EU is about Echo vs Liquid, and they couldnt care where the guilds are from
[2022-12-29 15:40:02] <wolviecb> I've played for 10y on NA servers and now I'm playing EU servers... in general I would say NA is way more toxic IMHO
[2022-12-29 15:40:06] <%Tareah> @jacksplatt no. it's specifically no drama and people are trying to find some .
[2022-12-29 15:40:09] <%nevernude1> Do you think hardstyle is the secret to Echos success?
[2022-12-29 15:40:10] <TheSuspect95> @Naguura do you know what pet to use in m+ as a demonology warlock?
[2022-12-29 15:40:17] <%jacksplatt> @jacksplatt gotcha
[2022-12-29 15:40:19] <Speshulist> I watched the Echo stream as much as I could, but all they talked about was Americans and how bad we are haha
[2022-12-29 15:40:24] <%+devilwench> @devilwench Not as bad as it used to be.  Barring holidays/football events
[2022-12-29 15:40:24] <+michaelbluth> Let's not talk about Echo vs Liquid.  Lets talk about Greta vs DouchebagGuyOnTwitter
[2022-12-29 15:40:25] <ravachol79> @Naguura do you think that you will go back to world first raiding again?

[2022-12-29 15:49:57] <%sooziecuzie> Americans tend to have the same thing as other Americans. So, we talk about those commonalities that are nationwide. Unfortunately, we're also kind of weird and we assume that everyone is so familiar with America that people from other countries know about uniquely American things. It's just an American thing and it's okay.
[2022-12-29 15:49:59] <jllaww> America is the most culturally diverse country in the world
[2022-12-29 15:50:00] <+meady> It’s because America doesn’t know about anything but America
[2022-12-29 15:50:01] <%rucythedruid> I think some of that is just a comfort or hospitality thing. Not assuming you DONT know something. So just including you as if you do.

[2022-12-29 15:50:47] <+blessedIgnorant> I think a big part of it is the strength of your English - you can clearly hold extremely deep conversations so in spite of your accent they may when comfortable kind of forget it's not your primary language.   Same for colloquialisms.

[2022-12-29 16:00:34] <PooleGuyTy> Americans deal the same thing. Small talk on planes, in elevators and long ques. Here’s how we deal - headphones. I often don’t have anything playing but they’re clearly visible. People typically leave me be
[2022-12-29 16:00:40] <+SimplyBlu> Americans like to share but not with the intent make deep connections. EU/Asians are the opposite and are more purposeful with their communication.

[2022-12-29 16:02:25] <Picard2207> the correct answer to "How do you do" is How do you do or hello
[2022-12-29 16:02:29] <+Asura_Shini> nah its fine just depends on where you are. like washroom stalls in a no go
[2022-12-29 16:02:30] <+Doctor3_> who the hell do you spend time with in america? as an american, a lot of what you're saying is not accurate lol
[2022-12-29 16:02:32] <faulen> "Hey how you doing?" is a question that they don't expect a real answer from. "I'm good" is what most people say

[2022-12-29 16:04:01] <%sooziecuzie> My mom is a nurse and when strangers find that out, they tell her about their medical problems. It's the weirdest thing.
[2022-12-29 16:04:03] <+aperri> @Naguura hai :) do you think outlaw or sub is superior in m+ and raid?
[2022-12-29 16:04:04] <cyarinn_> You should visit the northeast US. People are incredibly standoffish here. Saying Hi to a stranger is unheard of here.
[2022-12-29 16:04:11] <%+moredot> ok now youre just being rude
[2022-12-29 16:04:13] <+Ozzie97> I always say "hey", "hi", "how are you"....maybe I'm the weird american lol
[2022-12-29 16:04:15] <+daddical> straight face stare them down. assert dominance

[2022-12-29 16:04:55] <Demonic26> lol do not go to louisiana. their accent is a different breed
[2022-12-29 16:04:57] <faulen> if you say Hey, they think you want to talk to them. If you have nothing to say, just nod
[2022-12-29 16:04:58] <@%Kuroz> there's no other reasoning
[2022-12-29 16:05:01] <+nickfrenzy> just laugh and nod even if you don't know what they said
[2022-12-29 16:05:08] <Tehalii> it's ok i can't hear shit so I'm always asking people to repeat themselves
[2022-12-29 16:05:17] <+Culver42> No one is coming up to you and asking "how old are you"
[2022-12-29 16:05:18] <+SimplyBlu> I think if they cared enough to continue the conversation with you, they'll try harder to communicate.
[2022-12-29 16:05:19] <%jacksplatt> I had a friend from Wisconsin visit me, and he had no idea what some people were saying. He couldn't understand a southern accent.

[2022-12-29 16:06:37] <Mitleidsfollower> I used to work in a team with a software engineer from texas, a czech and one guy from new england. In combination with my austrian english that was one hella interesting experience

[2022-12-29 16:06:50] <%+mrhigher> @Naguura I know its a question in some form, but think about it like it is a greeting

[2022-12-29 16:06:53] <%+RizGritz> I respond and thank them, and then ask it back lol
[2022-12-29 16:06:54] <%jacksplatt> I usually say things like " I am still alive." , "Not dead yet", "They haven't found me yet"
[2022-12-29 16:06:54] <+SimplyBlu> We don't really care for response. Just being polite and moving on with our life.
[2022-12-29 16:06:55] <+Thoreya> u said im great and keep it moving
[2022-12-29 16:06:56] <RafaCM_94> i stop feeeling weird about it when i learned people dont want to know the answer they are just specting a "good how are you?" back, so just remember that sentence and answer with that LUL

[2022-12-29 16:07:02] <+EnzSafari> as an american i take that as a question, especially if i dont want to talk anymore to make it awkward
[2022-12-29 16:07:10] <+nickfrenzy> as a cashier I had someone in my line ask me how I was doing and when I went to respond, they cut me off saying they didn't care

You most likely feel stressed from travelling, maybe casting itself and moving around in unknown places. Your mind is then like: "lets do that later at home when i can rest".
[2022-12-29 16:15:12] <zerdo1234> ah hmm you probably cant get in a rational headspace and beeing stuck in only work, like someone living at there workplace maybe you could do some meditation or something too calm your mind, but im not deep into that stuff

[2022-12-29 18:54:40] <+Elvik> Because no one wants to play pala. No need to change things then ^^

[2022-12-29 18:59:30] <westonodom> there's a really handy WA I have that adds a border glow to talents you can remove without losing your tree. I can share it if you want.
