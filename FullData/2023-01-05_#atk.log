[2023-01-05 13:03:34] <%+weirdflavour> hey atk what are your thoughts on sub swiftness bluelancer instead of crt? I recently switched and it feels better in terms of value for the raid, I am mostly in boundless mp mode and can give my shields and buffs every 5-10 seconds depends on which skill. I tested in trixion and the damage is overall the same right now but the utility of GL is much more important than the damage

[2023-01-05 13:15:32] <+olympicsage> man iv lvled up gunlancer  (blue) up to 1475 did clown with him felt like im hitting him with a wood stick. da fuk is that?! so dissapointed :( from the gold investment
[2023-01-05 13:16:07] <+samnus2> But I wanted to say they said on season 2 it was really big in Europe and South America I was wondering if it was mostly loa players LUL
[2023-01-05 13:16:30] <+ravenmastergg> @olympicsage why play blue kekw. go red for big D dmg
[2023-01-05 13:16:35] <billydragon17> I view GLs as semi support class, they have mediocre damage but has a lot of utility
[2023-01-05 13:16:51] <%+Tsius> @olympicsage blue lancer is constant dps, no big dmg and almost unkillable
[2023-01-05 13:17:04] <+samnus2> But its a good show tbh everyone looks good and has good personalities very interesting I took notes

[2023-01-05 14:02:56] <%+deadlypants112> on kr 600k ish because of inflation i think

[2023-01-05 17:00:40] <%TekuMehku> I wish they had key bindings for each class bc igniter in a side mouse button feels so good
[2023-01-05 17:00:47] <SaintBobby> my tip would be to not have the next skill you're going to use after you switch weapons on the same finger as the switching
[2023-01-05 17:00:50] <+greyxx_> LOL

[2023-01-05 19:57:19] <Lethalseconds> @kol4x It might be a one time investment I guess some customers buy the bus because they dont want to prog the raid for multiple days and with the horns they can get in reclear lobbies
[2023-01-05 19:57:23] <kol4x> @kol4x Susge a lot of them

[2023-01-05 19:58:27] <+rakeeth> saw someone selling NAE brel 1-6 for 80k. 80k doesn't need RMT. but if you have roster to earning 80k per week you would just clear it not buy bus
[2023-01-05 19:58:29] <@%+Shikiro> I bought a Brel 1-2 run on my summoner last week though so I could push it's ilevel up
[2023-01-05 19:58:33] <kol4x> not saying they rmt for everything but buying rmt gold for the bus is very likely imo
[2023-01-05 19:58:34] <+Tale_DJx1004> guess it's a reset because the color was not a favorable one
[2023-01-05 19:58:41] <Pievor> can u even do the red side as 4 man

[2023-01-05 20:16:59] <@%+Shikiro> Witcher is a very popular game though
[2023-01-05 20:16:59] <janveee> true id rather have high bc prices than dc in a brel raid tho
[2023-01-05 20:17:05] <+timore2> if they just put ID verification like KR we wouldnt have any of these problems its really not that complicated
[2023-01-05 20:17:11] <SalemVendetta> in my clown, 2 of us dc'd like 4 times each. then during a vykas, people kept dc'ing on g1 and g2

[2023-01-05 20:18:19] <%lostsoulz1010> @Kaizeo_ you can spoof phone numbers
[2023-01-05 20:18:20] <OffAmbrosia> they can't even do that anyway, they would need their own launcher to do anything close to that. Since it's launched through steam, there's no shot
[2023-01-05 20:18:20] <+duriandorito> its also harder to roll that out to all the different servers internationally

[2023-01-05 21:07:23] <+ImperatorTrex> I want to switch to support, any clear differences between bard or paladin? Or are they both excepted?
[2023-01-05 21:07:36] <River337> bard is more fun to play but they're both great

[2023-01-05 21:07:49] <@%+Shikiro> @ImperatorTrex yes quite a few differences but both accepted well
[2023-01-05 21:07:51] <+kentaottv> @ImperatorTrex any is good bard is 100x more fun to play imo
[2023-01-05 21:07:52] <wasem98> is there bots on KR?

[2023-01-05 21:08:59] <+ImperatorTrex> Yeah I dont mind having engaging game play as a support. Bard it is.
