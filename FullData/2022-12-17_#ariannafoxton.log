[2022-12-17 20:36:53] <!%TheSwatKnight> because you can switch your server to a community server that allows public discovery but also gives you more tools to monitor the server
[2022-12-17 20:37:06] <!%TheSwatKnight> however the fine print reads like it's not intended for our type of servers?

[2022-12-17 22:40:04] <%Talshere> @Panderrific I abandoned any pretence at programming when I realised my schools "IT" course was basically "how to set up a printer". I did geography instead.

[2022-12-17 22:41:05] <%Talshere> @HighCaliberTree I mean, if you got the ability to write a script out of it itll help in most jobs that utalise a computer.

[2022-12-17 23:22:01] <%Talshere> @parters316 The sensible line is to do front lines Imperial Guard in the first instance. Let the Imp Guard be the "everyman" to introduce us to the carnage that is the grim dark future
[2022-12-17 23:23:01] <+parters316> @Talshere personally i think something more character driven like eisenhorn or maybe something personal small scale is a great start
[2022-12-17 23:23:24] <+parters316> plus doing big battles is mega mega expensive imagine having to animate thousands or millions of tyranids
[2022-12-17 23:23:51] <%Talshere> I just think going hard on the Inquisition might require too much front loaded lore.

[2022-12-17 23:41:14] <%$Panderrific> 2027 was the original
[2022-12-17 23:41:17] <%+QualityNotGuaranteed> tabletop rpg I think
[2022-12-17 23:41:25] <DerHasso> a role playing game, like D&D
[2022-12-17 23:41:27] <KishiAlpha> cyber punk is based in Real life Kappa
[2022-12-17 23:41:53] <%Talshere> The Cyberpunk anima on Netflix was pretty great
[2022-12-17 23:41:57] <%$Panderrific> or well.. 2077 was based 50 years after the original material
[2022-12-17 23:41:59] <%$Panderrific> afaik
[2022-12-17 23:42:09] VIEWERS: 121
[2022-12-17 23:42:13] <%LossyInput> it's very good
[2022-12-17 23:42:28] <%LossyInput> the anime itself is also depressing
[2022-12-17 23:42:34] <%Ilies45> the time has come for me to leave
[2022-12-17 23:42:35] <@%Wloos> Ye it can be ostracizing
[2022-12-17 23:42:41] <%Talshere> Its worth a watch. Its the first Anime Ive watched in years.
[2022-12-17 23:42:44] <%$Panderrific> niche stuff can always be skipped tbf
[2022-12-17 23:42:46] <!%TheSwatKnight> did I hear anime
[2022-12-17 23:42:48] <%Ilies45> have a great day
[2022-12-17 23:42:59] <krispypapa69> I feel you
[2022-12-17 23:43:03] <!%TheSwatKnight> time to watch Gundam musicmommyHyperNod
[2022-12-17 23:43:05] <%$Panderrific> but yes, the more i hear about a show, the more i wanna watch it so i can see what the fuss is about
[2022-12-17 23:43:08] <NaokiAzul> Relatable really noto2dDed
[2022-12-17 23:43:10] <!%harunadess> ye, maybe fun to watch with people to hang out if you're not interested yourself
[2022-12-17 23:43:15] <saucskeucheesa> @Panderrific Yea. I thought edgerunners was pretty great. Not too long or short.
[2022-12-17 23:43:37] <%$Panderrific> ive still only seen 2 episodes of arcane lol
[2022-12-17 23:43:47] <%$Panderrific> watched them while i was ironing yesterday
[2022-12-17 23:43:48] <%Talshere> @Panderrific You need to fix that.
[2022-12-17 23:43:57] <%$Panderrific> @Panderrific in the process lol
[2022-12-17 23:44:08] <KishiAlpha> i only read the chainsawman manga

[2022-12-17 23:44:27] <KishiAlpha> never got interresed in the anime
[2022-12-17 23:44:31] <%Talshere> Even my GF was blown away by Arcane and she is neither a gamer nor ever watched a single anime
[2022-12-17 23:44:46] <saucskeucheesa> Well, I feel like anime is pretty oversaturated with harem and slice of life stuff. I just stick to niche or strange anime
[2022-12-17 23:44:56] <%$Panderrific> ya, it was the game awards that finally put the nail in the coffin and made me watch arcane
