[2023-01-07 11:20:31] <@%MNIM73> I must confess I am guilty of abusing this very common bug known as ATywin SB S3 to get RTA legend. I am sorry to the legitimate non ATywin players out there. I saw an opportunity to create an unfair advantage for myself and I took it. I will accept the 90 day ban that Smilegate has handed out and hope fellow ATywin abusers reflect on their behavior. I hope next season I can qualify legitimately for Epic 7 World Cup without abusing ATywin.
