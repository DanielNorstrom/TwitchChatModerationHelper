[2023-01-06 14:10:58] <ScaCoyote> Valheim is a blast
[2023-01-06 14:11:11] <DiabloBG> Let Cringer find out if he is wrong or correct himself

[2023-01-06 14:11:19] <%UsualAdam> both Valheim and Project zomboid are a great shout
[2023-01-06 14:11:30] <ScaCoyote> Raided the motel and stole the ice
[2023-01-06 14:11:31] <serion___> Valheim does not cater to playing solo which sucks, you either have a group of friend you play with or you will be doing nothing but grinding resources if you want to build something
[2023-01-06 14:11:34] <floredon> open world game  mixed with 4x  elements could be interesting. like a  mix of strategy and action RPG
[2023-01-06 14:11:51] <%+TUFOM> I'm the rare person who did not like valheim. minecraft with extra steps
[2023-01-06 14:11:59] <dangerousgoods> @serion___ solo is fine, there is no rush
[2023-01-06 14:12:02] <serion___> I should finish Pentiment
[2023-01-06 14:12:08] <N373r> Valheim seemed a bit generic for my taste.

[2023-01-06 14:12:35] <!%Arkcard> @cringer alrighty. I’ll leave you a message on discord and we can sort it out. Project Zomboid and Valheim

[2023-01-06 15:06:32] <%Kalderasch> Also the connecting Autobahn is named by combining the numbers, like A565 connects the A5 to the A6.

[2023-01-06 15:09:47] <%Kalderasch> @DiabloBG the best I can guess is that they wanted to avoid the 2 digit numbers in case you get into that with the main autobahn. Like if you built A12, that number would be blocked if you connect A1 to A2.
[2023-01-06 15:10:54] <DiabloBG> What if you reach the 100s tho, not very forward thinking, the whole world should be covered by Autobahn... Kappa

[2023-01-06 18:32:27] <%+jstubbles> We need to get smarter about our farming practices, too. We waste wayyyyyyyy too much water with farming. People should convert to aero or hydroponic systems.
