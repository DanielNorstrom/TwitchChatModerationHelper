[2022-12-25 07:41:36] <!%+abomz> From Wikipedia - QAnon[a] (/ÀàkjuÀê…ôn…ín/ KYOO-…ô-non, /ÀàkjuÀê√¶n…ín/ KYOO-a-non) is an American political conspiracy theory and political movement. It originated in the American far-right political sphere in 2017.[1] QAnon centers on fabricated claims made by an anonymous individual or individuals known as "Q". Those claims have been relayed, developed and supplemented by numerous communities and influencers associated with the movement.

[2022-12-25 09:03:34] <!%GeordieTwitch> I prefer movies like Silence of the Lambs, horrors are not as scary as things that could actually happen

[2022-12-25 09:05:38] <%Dr_LuBuFu> AvP2 has my favorite movie quote "The government never lies to people" Government proceeds to nuke that person
[2022-12-25 09:05:40] <Veritas_12647> Worst movie I've seen in a long time was The Last Airbender. How do you take a show with such a great story already right there for you to work off of and fuck it up so royally bad?

[2022-12-25 09:07:28] <Veritas_12647> I think if you went into The Last Airbender without ever watching the show it might have been tolerable, but if you knew what it should have been, it was abysmal.
[2022-12-25 09:07:47] <%+grevinzel> @ETMartians99 same.. I'm still catching up on Breaking Bad
