[2022-12-26 21:53:31] <%ynlokk> @ex__animo To this point, there are too many different pacing levels among gamers. Some people dont even like storylines in games.
[2022-12-26 21:54:22] <+ex__animo> Absolutely. And of course, to each their own, makes sense. However as it goes, is; discourse is engaging and powerful, so maintaing an aptitude, is useful

[2022-12-26 21:55:58] <+ex__animo> When it comes to games, I think Hideo Kojima is very plesant. All of the performers have made a powerful effort, I base this mainly on, however, the UI, the UI looks nice, is easy to engage with, and the cutscenes are neat
[2022-12-26 21:56:34] <+ex__animo> For some reason, it reminds me of Berserk
[2022-12-26 21:56:34] <%ynlokk> The UI can be further optimised, imo.
[2022-12-26 21:56:50] VIEWERS: 259

[2022-12-26 22:04:10] <%Plsk1n> Yes
[2022-12-26 22:04:12] <%+oxan94> @Plsk1n is that on the 1st game?
[2022-12-26 22:04:15] <%ynlokk> well, you can date NPC in Mass Effect.
[2022-12-26 22:04:19] <%+oxan94> i really forgot
[2022-12-26 22:04:22] <Ryouga0815> If you have played Dragonage, then you may have an idea how Mass Effect plays.
[2022-12-26 22:04:30] <%kradon96> Honey pop is not a bad game. Is a dating sim . That after you "sleep" with the nice ladies they send you pics to remind you of her. NSFW pics
[2022-12-26 22:04:42] <%Plsk1n> Yeah I think it was on the first one
[2022-12-26 22:04:44] <+ex__animo> see, IMO you can't date NPC in mass effect, it's more of an expression off of the emotional interactions and engagements of a character, and how you percieve it

[2022-12-26 22:05:07] <%PvrplxAce79> @ex__animo not witth that attitude you can't
[2022-12-26 22:05:10] <+ex__animo> Then, eventually, you come to a conclusion it's a deep, introspective conversation with yourself
[2022-12-26 22:05:21] <+ex__animo> And that is how art, is predominantly interpredated
[2022-12-26 22:05:30] <%ynlokk> @ex__animo of course, within the limitations of the storyline.
[2022-12-26 22:05:34] <%+oxan94> what i like form mass effect is that story wise your decisions matter you could literrally kill everyone if you take the wrong choices
[2022-12-26 22:05:54] <%ynlokk> There is a remaster of the trilogy, iirc
[2022-12-26 22:05:56] <%PvrplxAce79> kill everyone? teru is great at doing that
[2022-12-26 22:06:00] <%Alno_> It still looks good to this day
