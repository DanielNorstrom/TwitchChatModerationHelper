[2022-12-31 03:23:41] <@%^Streamlabs> TeeP enjoys the core gameplay of WZ 2.0. Loves the look and feel of the map. TeeP prefers free loadout to be during 1st circle and more money economy on the map. Hitching/Lagging is an issue as well. TeeP loves the game so far and looks forward to quality of life improvements. TeeP does not know what the exact meta will be for the game, but the meta will probably evolve quickly as it did for WZ 1. TeeP will be using a variety of loadouts. - !guns for more info

[2022-12-31 15:31:41] <ItzGibbyy> @Hyperbeam__ I agreed before this season. JB is more consistent and he WAS  a better defender, but JT has become a top 3 two way forward.

[2022-12-31 15:32:39] <ItzGibbyy> @silasminer Kyrie has the ball handling, but name something else that he is actually better at. Maybe passing?
[2022-12-31 15:32:54] <@%kush06> better shooter and passer too @ItzGibbyy

[2022-12-31 15:33:50] <%lawdamercy505> Is there really a debate rn about Kyrie n JB?
