[2022-12-09 17:56:29] <Elerorine> Warrger programmed a stream in 30 min, so he might not be dead!!! , wonder what happen to him.
[2022-12-09 17:56:29] <@thuejk> @AntiElitz I made a flamethrower prediction. If I am not here, decide it for me.
[2022-12-09 17:56:44] VIEWERS: 116
[2022-12-09 17:56:45] <@thuejk> 5 minutes.
[2022-12-09 17:56:48] <%dalvoss> Should switch stream category to cartography.

[2022-12-09 18:03:59] <%Mr_Bucket> I think they put in that you can remove founderbages from non active subs, not sure if it was ever automated
[2022-12-09 18:03:59] <%IamRedRafe> @antielitz fun fact: to power the whole 100% you'd need 2.015 yellow belts of bananas elitzBanana
[2022-12-09 18:04:38] <mmmkkaaayy> what consumes the banana? monkey on generator  treadmill?

[2022-12-09 18:05:20] <Negarretep> Presumably you'd dump the bananas into a furnace

[2022-12-09 18:07:10] <dr_lepper> the real question is whether the run happens KappaPride
[2022-12-09 18:07:17] <%anothernamebitesthedust> Chat delay doesn't matter because all maps are bad Kappa
[2022-12-09 18:07:21] <%thedoh> it's happening right now
