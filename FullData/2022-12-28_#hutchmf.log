[2022-12-28 23:20:21] <slaysalldays> steam audio changed to (something else) on 4 maps, customs included but not all maps are fixed for enw sound
[2022-12-28 23:20:22] <%Wootloops> pause the download then resume it
[2022-12-28 23:20:26] <%Wootloops> should kick it faster
[2022-12-28 23:20:27] <%Cavalree> Did they put any nipple attachments in the game?
[2022-12-28 23:20:30] <@%BIG_RIFF> apparently if you pause and unpause it speeds up
