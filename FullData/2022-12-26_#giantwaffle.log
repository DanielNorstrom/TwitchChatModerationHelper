[2022-12-26 16:16:56] <%+ronnyboy100> you can also centrifuge redstone to get chrome
[2022-12-26 16:17:03] <+thebubbajones1> That sounds much easier^
[2022-12-26 16:17:13] <%ForgottenTime> just automate 8k and make it future proof
[2022-12-26 16:17:22] <Yakobro> centrifuge it twice yea
[2022-12-26 16:17:55] <Yakobro> 60 redstone to 1 chrome, but you can dlm redstone

[2022-12-26 16:20:38] <Yakobro> @snotneuss it's complicated, there's not really huge grinds or deadly enemies, but the logistics is the challenge

[2022-12-26 16:21:24] <%Zapper_777> from small or tiny manganese dust?
[2022-12-26 16:21:31] <Aeliel_> tier 2 gets you tantalite with manganese
[2022-12-26 16:21:35] <+thebubbajones1> How far are we from ore generation?
[2022-12-26 16:22:02] <PureSpider> tantalite huh
[2022-12-26 16:22:22] <Yakobro> @Giantwaffle you can buy the ore and it gives a LOAD if you crush it, t2/3 microminers give it as byproducts
[2022-12-26 16:22:25] <drsnaki96> i think you could get it easily as tiny dust by-product from ore-washing something
[2022-12-26 16:22:31] <+The_robstah> this modpack has my interest but i also feel like it would drive insane
[2022-12-26 16:22:38] <Aeliel_> maybe it's only HM sorry

[2022-12-26 16:24:34] <Yakobro> @Giantwaffle to start off hv buy the pyrolusite ore with coins and macerate it I think

[2022-12-26 18:20:17] <%+TPells67> @giantwaffle like how much approx
[2022-12-26 18:20:21] <%HitscanSedan> @Corvous you can't go wrong with the quest 2 for the price, but index is probably the best experience overall but they're making a new one soon so maybe wait.
[2022-12-26 18:20:28] <%+Corvous> @TelRehiad yea thats what i thought. think i will wait for next gen and save them money for that then.

[2022-12-26 19:28:47] <Aldizzert> myoclonic jerk is what I've heard it called. It's a survival instinct, a reaction to the feeling of falling from when we used to sleep in trees.

[2022-12-26 19:48:56] <+Kinteshi> @TelRehiad yes they do but to use them in there you need to get the first lv, by selecting the mob and kill it a few times in the normal version of the mod thats why im asking but i got an answer

[2022-12-26 21:17:36] <macdrai> No street of tarkov?
[2022-12-26 21:17:36] <%0x4273> OMEGALUL bad trailer
[2022-12-26 21:17:36] <%DaemonSzyman> no date wtf?
[2022-12-26 21:17:37] <+GoldAxe> L trailer lmao
[2022-12-26 21:17:40] <warmwalrus> no date wtf
[2022-12-26 21:17:49] <%aundros> ok, can someone explain exactly what this update is about?
[2022-12-26 21:17:51] <BuLLeT_LV> Well, that was something! Kappa
[2022-12-26 21:17:56] <weightmaker> more like a teaser than a trailer
[2022-12-26 21:17:56] <GuardMoony> streets is the part connecting all maps
[2022-12-26 21:18:06] <macdrai> @aundros supposedly the best map yet
[2022-12-26 21:18:11] <$JonathanLivingstonSeagull> are you gonna have twitch drops for tarkov on the 29th?
[2022-12-26 21:18:18] <+Tasar_> Proimise nothing and never disappoint
[2022-12-26 21:18:24] <%aundros> @aundros Was this the map they showed off?
[2022-12-26 21:18:27] <TytuxTv> 4 parts
[2022-12-26 21:18:39] <PistolPeteHogan> Klean has a video that explains what the full release will look like
[2022-12-26 21:18:48] <Qbertman> what jetpack are you using waffle?
[2022-12-26 21:18:57] <+gdawg99> I dont play these type of games. How does EFT compare to rust or dayz
[2022-12-26 21:18:58] <PistolPeteHogan> Ths current game is pretty much all the sidequests for the main game
[2022-12-26 21:19:04] VIEWERS: 3 144
[2022-12-26 21:19:09] <TytuxTv> 5 fps map KEKW
[2022-12-26 21:19:20] <warmwalrus> audio and lighting
[2022-12-26 21:19:21] <coloradostrong> the hackers and cheaters are the biggest issue
[2022-12-26 21:19:23] <%aundros> Sounds like its more to this update. Shame they didn't show it off
[2022-12-26 21:19:26] <TheIrishGuy> they removed steam aduio
[2022-12-26 21:19:30] <TytuxTv> they said will be removed
[2022-12-26 21:19:33] <+GrumpyEngineer0> How enjoyable is Tarkov solo? I've been interested but I don't think any of my friends would play it.
[2022-12-26 21:19:33] <+TrevorVictrus> I'm pretty sure its because they overlayed steam audio on a lot of their old stuff which was terrible
[2022-12-26 21:19:43] <MoshiMoshi0> @Giantwaffle steam audio is good, they removed it because it was heavy on performance
[2022-12-26 21:19:46] <GuardMoony> The audio was really bad on stairs
[2022-12-26 21:19:52] <$JonathanLivingstonSeagull> are you gonna hit the goal of beating the pack before new years?
[2022-12-26 21:20:03] <%maccabeus> @GrumpyEngineer0 depends on how good you are at coping with loss :)

[2022-12-26 21:23:14] <%OrangeW2> yeah the subreddit impressions aren't positive lol
[2022-12-26 21:23:15] <%ImNotDonut_> at least give us a wipe date or something
[2022-12-26 21:23:22] <%TheWonderLlama> Hype train derailed PepeHands

[2022-12-26 21:23:39] <IHaveShirts> just like in-game, the audio is borked
[2022-12-26 21:23:40] <%OrangeW2> and the livestream was laggy KEKW
[2022-12-26 21:23:41] <+Fishinchips9> Literally just rp walking aruond like barely any parts of the map with no audio
[2022-12-26 21:27:35] <+Omnirex> in-game trader at the end on lighthouse also
[2022-12-26 21:27:41] <%ImNotDonut_> and that lighthouse bridge is always camped, no way anyone is going to use the in game trader

[2022-12-26 21:27:58] <psilentath> @ImNotDonut_ more like ingame traitor ;D
[2022-12-26 21:28:02] <PistolPeteHogan> @ImNotDonut_ I've never been camped at that bridge
[2022-12-26 21:28:06] <PistolPeteHogan> I'm probably in the minority though
[2022-12-26 21:28:07] <+Omnirex> if its a quest based trader that would be dope
[2022-12-26 21:28:08] <$jordan2185> You didn’t upgrade the magma draw
[2022-12-26 21:28:08] <%ImNotDonut_> @PistolPeteHogan really? Must be lucky then
