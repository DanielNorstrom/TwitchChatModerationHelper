[2023-01-01 10:46:59] <!%mystery_e> You could read a research paper from arXiv, they are all open access ;)
[2023-01-01 10:47:10] <!%RezaDarkside> you have a website!
[2023-01-01 10:47:30] <%CrazyBaldMan> Well, from what I understand, one of the bigger reasons they have kept extending it has to do with Disney so that MIckey Mouse and their other core characters do not become public domain, and that has been one of the bigger reasons.

[2023-01-01 11:35:04] <%Snofford> @tronman3000 that's a very broad question. if you haven't already, you could try out if donating blood is for you

[2023-01-01 11:49:29] <!%RezaDarkside> such a great idea

[2023-01-01 11:55:12] <%davechilla> gotta grind it
[2023-01-01 11:55:14] <!%RezaDarkside> grinder and filter?
[2023-01-01 11:55:36] <!%RezaDarkside> i mean it might work
[2023-01-01 11:55:36] <%hi_im_meo> I hope I can fall asleep >< It's 3AM but not sleepy, had some late night green tea, oops
[2023-01-01 11:55:45] <%davechilla> you could chew the beans and spit it into a  filter but it's  a bit gross
[2023-01-01 11:55:56] <JustBorB> you can cook the coffee in a pot
[2023-01-01 11:56:03] <SheepInACart> If you have chocolate, just melt it, dip the beans and let them set, its actually pretty tasty, and more caffene than an extraciton
[2023-01-01 11:56:16] <%hi_im_meo> It's okay, that's why I've got you, my favorited European streamer :D
[2023-01-01 11:56:21] <Zyndr_> pantyhose might be a better filter
[2023-01-01 11:56:21] <JustBorB> itÂ´s a quiet good
[2023-01-01 11:56:27] <%tronman3000> grind the coffee in the sock than pour water into the sock over a chemex or a pot. and finally boil the coffee on the stove.

[2023-01-01 11:57:23] <%wittekip_nl> i would rob a bank to get coffee, easily

[2023-01-01 11:57:51] <!%RezaDarkside> i have not had a coffee for a month
[2023-01-01 11:57:53] <%davechilla> I wouldn't go to prison over bean juice
[2023-01-01 11:58:03] <%tronman3000> more easily to rob a 7/11 for coffee and get a free slushy while your at it.
[2023-01-01 11:58:20] <%hi_im_meo> @RezaDarkside how?
[2023-01-01 11:58:41] VIEWERS: 239
[2023-01-01 11:58:44] <SheepInACart> If there was a 7/11 he'd just buy the coffee, the issue is the only place left opens a gas sation
[2023-01-01 11:59:00] <!%RezaDarkside> @hi_im_meo stopped buying it, but i was only drinking one cup a day for a while
[2023-01-01 11:59:37] <%Snofford> does this technically count as a subway?
[2023-01-01 11:59:37] <%hi_im_meo> I make it a couple of weeks, go "this is great, I have less anxiety" then someone reminds me I am paid by how quickly I think, and I am not thinking quickly enough, and back I go to drinking the black tea :p
[2023-01-01 11:59:41] <%davechilla> if you put vanilla and chocolate in your coffee  is it a 3 bean soup?
[2023-01-01 11:59:54] <SheepInACart> I rely on coffee to survive the 6th working day of the week, otherwise I don't normally have it.

[2023-01-01 13:10:45] <%davechilla> used to be every drill you used on a node reduced the number of ore you could get, but that was changed in a patch semi recently
[2023-01-01 13:10:57] <Z3R0gravitas> Yes. You can make a dedicated server.
