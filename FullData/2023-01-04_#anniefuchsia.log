[2023-01-04 16:34:04] <eisenrs> is there an import for the demo cooldowns weakaura you're using?

[2023-01-04 21:20:38] <%JurgenRapp> it has died at least two times
[2023-01-04 21:25:27] <%JurgenRapp> the part where the dragons are facing each other is insane

[2023-01-04 21:38:42] <%JurgenRapp> one of the guys had to switch to mobile
[2023-01-04 21:38:53] <%drzaius30> no was asking @bYTEfROG KEKW
[2023-01-04 21:38:57] <%JurgenRapp> ah

[2023-01-04 21:39:45] <%drzaius30> EZ
[2023-01-04 21:40:30] <%drzaius30> Tank on mobile data now LUL
[2023-01-04 21:40:47] <%JurgenRapp> yeah this will go great Sadge
[2023-01-04 21:41:25] <%JurgenRapp> mobile = random lag spikes I guess it can't work
[2023-01-04 21:42:15] <%drzaius30> he said he has cleared before on mobile data Shruge
[2023-01-04 21:42:36] <%JurgenRapp> well then may the force be with them
[2023-01-04 21:47:51] <%JurgenRapp> look for the bros
[2023-01-04 21:49:22] <%JurgenRapp> oh no the panic voice
[2023-01-04 21:49:29] <%JurgenRapp> Death
[2023-01-04 21:50:07] <%JurgenRapp> you can hear it in the voice instantly when someone fcks up
[2023-01-04 21:51:48] <%drzaius30> it can be disheartening almost clearing then failing previous phases and having crap like internet drop outs zeplaQcry
[2023-01-04 21:53:26] <%Geoffku> my wrist hurts Sadge
[2023-01-04 21:53:42] <%JurgenRapp> indeed but that's just how it is, in the rwf they always had a couple of bad pulls between the good ones it seemed
[2023-01-04 21:53:59] <%JurgenRapp> everyone must refocus somehow
[2023-01-04 21:54:00] <%drzaius30> @Geoffku carpel tunnel ?
[2023-01-04 21:54:08] <%JurgenRapp> carpe diem
[2023-01-04 21:54:30] <%Geoffku> not quite that severe zaius
[2023-01-04 21:54:36] <%Taylor131313> ok this tank was a dumbass
[2023-01-04 21:54:38] <%Geoffku> I used to have real bad carpal tunnel tho
[2023-01-04 21:54:46] <%Taylor131313> killed my motivation to do another 16 xdd
[2023-01-04 21:54:57] <%Geoffku> what happened? LUL
[2023-01-04 21:55:20] <%Taylor131313> ok so, SBG 16 first boss
[2023-01-04 21:55:30] <%Taylor131313> tank goes like "stack on me we cc add and ignore it"
[2023-01-04 21:55:34] <%Taylor131313> me like "wat"
[2023-01-04 21:55:41] <%Taylor131313> but ok I suppose, maybe it's some giga 5Head strat
[2023-01-04 21:56:03] <%Taylor131313> first add gets CC'd but little does he know that boss still eats it and heals it and gets +20% damage
[2023-01-04 21:56:17] <%Taylor131313> tank goes down like a sack of potato, I rez him
[2023-01-04 21:56:21] <%Geoffku> xdd
[2023-01-04 21:56:29] <%Taylor131313> next AOE a dps goes down, 5 min to CR, ok I suppose
[2023-01-04 21:56:36] <%Taylor131313> next add he tries the same shit and guess what happens
[2023-01-04 21:56:49] <%Taylor131313> me be like peepoVanish
[2023-01-04 21:57:28] <%Geoffku> docLeave
[2023-01-04 21:57:45] <%Taylor131313> docLeave indeed
[2023-01-04 21:58:11] <%Taylor131313> maybe that tactic could work in 12 fortified when 10% boss hp and 20% damage ain't much, but not in 16 tyrannical xdd
[2023-01-04 22:05:52] <%JurgenRapp> Sadeg break time
[2023-01-04 22:06:54] <%drzaius30> Zepla having to educate chat on sellys raid leading

[2023-01-04 22:07:08] <%JurgenRapp> it is what it is
[2023-01-04 22:07:14] <%JurgenRapp> I think he seems good
[2023-01-04 22:08:16] <%drzaius30> People getting sloppy calling what it is
[2023-01-04 22:08:59] <%JurgenRapp> yeah last night he was the one fing up
[2023-01-04 22:09:04] <%JurgenRapp> and he admitted it
[2023-01-04 22:10:01] <%drzaius30> He even blamed his damage on the 1% wipe as healer KEKW
[2023-01-04 22:10:16] <%JurgenRapp> but it's a hard thing to admit that you f-ed up and you have no excuse
[2023-01-04 22:11:28] <%JurgenRapp> I'm very impressed by the way they do this
[2023-01-04 22:13:02] <%JurgenRapp> I think I would be wining so much KEKW
[2023-01-04 22:13:38] <%JurgenRapp> *whining

[2023-01-04 22:22:04] <%drzaius30> They do
[2023-01-04 22:22:11] <%JurgenRapp> that's cool
[2023-01-04 22:22:23] <%drzaius30> they have an internal clear team
[2023-01-04 22:22:46] <%JurgenRapp> that is actually awesome

[2023-01-04 22:28:20] <%drzaius30> oof
[2023-01-04 22:29:29] <%Taylor131313> those mechanics don't make sense to me xdd
[2023-01-04 22:29:33] <%JurgenRapp> so fing close it's insane
[2023-01-04 22:29:50] <%JurgenRapp> 2x
[2023-01-04 22:30:45] <%JurgenRapp> was they love on damage or why the insta wipe
[2023-01-04 22:30:57] <%drzaius30> Timer YEP
[2023-01-04 22:31:09] <%JurgenRapp> so they must do more damage
[2023-01-04 22:31:12] <%JurgenRapp> that is all
[2023-01-04 22:31:48] <%drzaius30> i think they can skip that final mechanic with more damage
[2023-01-04 22:32:36] <%JurgenRapp> so how do they get the extra damage, zepla not dying?
[2023-01-04 22:34:08] <%drzaius30> not dying everyone having there rotations perfect not wasting Burst window on unnecessary parts like thorden BEGGING
[2023-01-04 22:35:24] <%JurgenRapp> 10 min break
[2023-01-04 22:40:03] <%JurgenRapp> damn my engrish is broken some words are just so hardwired in the muscle memory from swedish, I catch them sometimes but not all of them
[2023-01-04 22:41:51] <%JurgenRapp> in swe had is hade and god means good, so I miss alot of those words sorry about that.
[2023-01-04 22:42:30] <%JurgenRapp> so if my writing doesn't make any sense that's why (most of the time)

[2023-01-04 23:01:23] <%JurgenRapp> was if they do 5 good 6 becomes easier
[2023-01-04 23:01:30] <%JurgenRapp> or something like that
[2023-01-04 23:01:40] <%JurgenRapp> or was it 6 -> 7
[2023-01-04 23:02:50] <%drzaius30> 6 is Hresvelgr and Nidhogg

[2023-01-04 23:04:54] <%JurgenRapp> but I remember Selly talking about it yesterday that if they did 5 or 6 good the one after was easier
[2023-01-04 23:05:12] <%drzaius30> it was funny when people first progged this phase and they killed Thorden KEKW
[2023-01-04 23:06:08] <%drzaius30> killed wiped and were like wut FeelsDankMan

[2023-01-04 23:57:59] <%Wardrick7> they really should make old content soloable
[2023-01-04 23:58:39] <%drzaius30> @Wardrick7 it would be if not for the biggest sword mechanic
[2023-01-04 23:58:46] <%drzaius30> big ass *
[2023-01-04 23:59:08] <%drzaius30> you can't attack while tanking the blade
[2023-01-04 23:59:18] <%Wardrick7> so thats what i mean, they should after some time change those mechanics if you are doing it unsynced
[2023-01-04 23:59:45] <%drzaius30> they probably will one day
