[2022-12-28 19:52:52] <%$casinocop> 🤗
[2022-12-28 19:53:00] <@%Kuglorf> Collars can have a multitude of meanings in a D/s relationship. They can show ownership, devotion, or subservience, and can be as meaningful as a wedding ring. They can be essential for some kinds of BDSM lifestyles, or just add spice to an already fun, kinky session.

[2022-12-28 22:38:18] <%hollowdroid> It's probably oversight as the project grows UX isn't much of a concern anymore
[2022-12-28 22:38:21] <+OrbitaLinx> So they dont have to fire their UX designers
[2022-12-28 22:38:25] <!%DoogieMacGyver> maybe theyre sexy interns? monkaHmmW
[2022-12-28 22:38:32] <+OrbitaLinx> Literally it keeps changing just to keep some people employed
[2022-12-28 22:38:53] <+OrbitaLinx> Cuz capitalism
[2022-12-28 22:38:56] <%hollowdroid> I think the devs sort of take over and UX is thrown out of the window
[2022-12-28 22:38:57] <@%Kuglorf> keep em hired but dont give them anything to do?
[2022-12-28 22:39:04] <%hollowdroid> It's not good practice though
[2022-12-28 22:39:09] <+OrbitaLinx> Its simple once the UI gets perfact it can only go down hill from their
[2022-12-28 22:39:10] <%Rakkars> new managers get hired when old ones get promoted and then they have to do something that "improves" or they'll never get promoted
[2022-12-28 22:39:14] <redaisenjack> so they have the same one when they need him for something that matters, instead of having to rehire someone

[2022-12-28 22:41:03] <%hollowdroid> dslilyBug
[2022-12-28 22:41:06] <%Svettgurkan> isn't "making it wors" usually just because UI's are designed with Console first and PC later ds_lily ? Hmm
[2022-12-28 22:41:14] <Mom_Online> but when is it making something better? Isn't that usually subjective?
[2022-12-28 22:41:29] <+OrbitaLinx> Right yes because some dude in a suit is breathing down their neck asking "what are you doing this quarter?"
[2022-12-28 22:41:32] <@%Kuglorf> you have to ask lily, lily decides
[2022-12-28 22:41:41] <%Nite01> dslilyThink
[2022-12-28 22:41:42] <%hollowdroid> I think with interfaces with as much complexity as POE is also another animal
[2022-12-28 22:41:47] <+SilencyV1> what is she doing ?
[2022-12-28 22:41:55] <%hollowdroid> vs like a TV or something
[2022-12-28 22:41:57] <redaisenjack> cant think of a single game where the ui changes has put me off from playing
[2022-12-28 22:42:02] <!%ArchaicSoul> They have to make it worse, so someone has to make it better. Since if all is good, there's no work and then the manager is unhappy, because no one is working, since all is perfect(good). It's simple really...
[2022-12-28 22:42:07] <@%Kuglorf> @SilencyV1 leveling up

[2022-12-28 22:42:38] <+OrbitaLinx> SMH YouTube but ye just to do something over doing nothing
[2022-12-28 22:42:41] <%hollowdroid> Which YT interface though?
[2022-12-28 22:42:46] <@%Kuglorf> @SilencyV1 less safe on hardcore
[2022-12-28 22:42:47] <%hollowdroid> There are many
[2022-12-28 22:43:06] <robo_robo> i know some ui change are to increase views and ad revenue even if it makes the experience worst
[2022-12-28 22:43:24] <@%Kuglorf> @SilencyV1 also depending on build its worth leveling and rushing later
[2022-12-28 22:43:40] <%Nite01> dslilyThink
[2022-12-28 22:43:47] <+TheMasterUdon> theyre catering to the normies, who dont have adblock
[2022-12-28 22:43:52] <robo_robo> thats the thing, they mold ui based on profitable users
[2022-12-28 22:43:52] <%hollowdroid> I dunno - product manager would normally make those calls
[2022-12-28 22:43:56] <!%ArchaicSoul> What's the chance to roll +1 to all with chaos orbs? Hopw many would one need on avg? :O
