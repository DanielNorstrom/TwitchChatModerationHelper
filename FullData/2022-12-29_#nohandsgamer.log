[2022-12-29 00:02:49] <sneackmcgeeks> it was a 5 mana 3/2?
[2022-12-29 00:03:14] <+Alieksey> It was 2 turned into 5. Because it can make you draw too many cards LUL
[2022-12-29 00:03:25] <karnykutach> @Lvl_100_Magikarp this guy @turn1concede is not even playing this game, dont bother him
[2022-12-29 00:03:36] <Naylon_nechmad> they should revert unleash the hounds to give all your beasts charge and +1 attack for 1 mana. that was extremely balanced

[2022-12-29 00:12:42] <pirate_raider> Either kill this turn, or lose, correct?
[2022-12-29 00:12:43] <Demobalderes> But where is it
[2022-12-29 00:13:41] <%+MrDeeJay> wow this deck can actually lose, didnt think it was possible

[2022-12-29 00:14:40] <mightyergoTV> juat two decks sit across each other, ignore the other is doing and disregards the board, as both decks juat try to kill the other turn 5 or 6 after one massive turn
[2022-12-29 00:14:50] <shiroocz> I have the feeling that core set will not have radiant elemental Kappa
[2022-12-29 00:15:13] <mightyergoTV> putting radiant elemental in the core set was a mistake
[2022-12-29 00:15:31] <sepoolkafunny> no more powerful cards in the core set

[2022-12-29 00:16:10] <+lurasidone11> mana cheating is always gonna be strong. If they get rid of mana cheating, it will just be overstatted stuff that is powerful, which is basically the same in a sense

[2022-12-29 01:03:38] <Yaya_> Obviously it hasn't been a problem until now but I think it's bizarre that the HS team picked up on both too much card draw and too much mana cheat being a problem with the game and then printed the DH quest
[2022-12-29 01:04:06] <Bawarczyk90> you delete Jace i think about it can yuo tell me something about this change ?
[2022-12-29 01:04:08] <Zuranthium> the game has been in the drain since the demon hunter set
[2022-12-29 01:04:14] <Anbuguy> Leeroy Jenkins created a strategy that revolved around trying to defeat your opponent in one turn without requiring any cards on the board. Fighting for board control and battles between minions make an overall game of Hearthstone more fun and compelling, but taking 20+ damage in one turn is not particularly fun or interactive.

Pain was so bad in 2018 and early 2019 I thought I was going to have to quit hearthstone. I'm able to type again in moderation which is a huge quality of life increase. Before on the stream I could only communicate with voice to text. Hoping to keep improving. Not looking to play high apm video games anytime soon though.

[2022-12-29 04:01:38] <+hokagedohs> i can tell u a tech card that puts u in advantage against mirrors @NoHandsGamer
[2022-12-29 04:01:39] <Magnarn1> thats like holy wrath good Kappa
[2022-12-29 04:01:43] <+hokagedohs> and is generally good as well
[2022-12-29 04:01:45] <Anbuguy> Leeroy Jenkins created a strategy that revolved around trying to defeat your opponent in one turn without requiring any cards on the board. Fighting for board control and battles between minions make an overall game of Hearthstone more fun and compelling, but taking 20+ damage in one turn is not particularly fun or interactive.
[2022-12-29 04:01:49] <s1ebenf1nger> Glad they nerfed Leeroy Jenkins back then. Man, that burst meta really was oppressive
[2022-12-29 04:01:56] <bob_the69th> stheno should have pen flinger voice line, thoughts?
[2022-12-29 04:02:01] <@%+KappaIRLol> @Lvl_100_Magikarp then theyd have to change the name to lady UN-stheeno
