[2023-01-09 15:10:22] <%xgon9> 762 PS shall be my friend this wipe. Klean was saying they move all that high end gear to lightkeeper.

[2023-01-09 15:10:25] <+blzngt> or aggression idk.

[2023-01-09 15:10:37] <veoko_> ngl they are making it way less fun when everyone just uses 762 ps mid wipe or just ump. hella boring

[2023-01-09 15:39:11] <doorknob1q> @bluberryredbull Felt that. Just either run around untill someone shoots at you and then plan from there, or just blast music and sprint around like an idiot, fear will go away eventually
[2023-01-09 15:39:14] <+pilkis111> oh right, how do you level the light/heavy armor mastery?

[2023-01-09 16:09:29] <+connfus3d> Issue is you can’t find 308
[2023-01-09 16:09:42] <+FragzPOV> thats what i think. it would make gun fights more fun
[2023-01-09 16:09:44] <veoko_> if they made it so level 5+ armor and level 5+ ap ammo off trader that would be fine
[2023-01-09 16:09:46] <+Bacon_TwitchTV> funny thing is they do it now, but all the people who are already lvl 40+ have ammo cases full of it. just messed with the low tier players

[2023-01-09 16:10:13] <+connfus3d> Yeah they should of did all the changes beginning wipe because some people have 5k+
[2023-01-09 16:10:13] <%+l0fer> And pulling meta gear off a meat sack will mean something
[2023-01-09 16:10:14] <%nihilism4life> @WillerZ thoughts on m80? think that was a smart choice because every other ammo for the caliber sucks donkey balls if its not m80 or high end ammo
[2023-01-09 16:10:15] <veoko_> but yea my main issue is it punishes everyone who isn't no lifeing the game
[2023-01-09 16:10:16] <%$yomabloodd> im telling you, they need to bring back finding weapons in raid as parts only

[2023-01-09 16:12:15] <yournansbowl> I feel like the 45.ap change was un needed, its not even that good an ammo, just an upgrade from basic 45p fmj
[2023-01-09 16:12:16] <%RickyMartinFPS> The less high tier stuff that is available the more fun this game is

[2023-01-09 16:12:59] <Brain64cores> @WillerZ Shieff said he farmed over a 1000 rounds of 7.62 bp in one raid
[2023-01-09 16:13:00] <%$deadlydayne> @TheRealTWebb  Yes it is.  Just because its barely "worse" than M62 doesnt mean it isnt the baseline of ammo for .308.   m855 is baseline 5.56.  m80 is BALL ammo.  its the lowest standard tier for .308
[2023-01-09 16:13:01] <%+l0fer> 54r is as strong as ever
[2023-01-09 16:13:05] <%+Xxlvl8xX> yeah the bp change is nice, might not see as many mutants and RDs this wipe
[2023-01-09 16:13:06] <%lisdexan> should we make their questlines or they look like will be removed too?

[2023-01-09 16:17:54] <%$deadlydayne> @guuge_gary_420  and with a steel penetrator it would be classified above ball with your definition, thus placing above M80, so.....
[2023-01-09 16:17:55] <%+cgags14> So prapor lvl 3 has barter for BS ammo, seems like the best ammo to get until max traders

[2023-01-09 16:36:51] <+CramboJ> my only issue with this wipe is the item stocks. just set a limit on amount to buy dont soft lock everyone from being able to progress.

[2023-01-09 16:36:57] <%A_PelayO_S> its a game not for all public

[2023-01-09 16:39:29] <thegreatspaget_> @paskral I'd say start sniping. I was having troubles surviving over the weekend. I was dying to 3 or 4 mans. Rats etc. So I started to snipe.

[2023-01-09 16:39:31] <%SneakySmoker38> i run in to SUPERMANS! they fly and dodge bullets whilst using their XRAY eyes to see you across the maps lol
[2023-01-09 16:39:33] <veoko_> @paskral if its groups you're against you have to run away or play slow, hard to kill 3/4 mans. if you die to solos, just peek first, desync is busted in this game
[2023-01-09 16:39:34] <%+Fedora_Mike> i have had to change tactics
[2023-01-09 16:39:43] <+CKing417> Lost friends because they got better

[2023-01-09 17:17:28] <NobleRacc> Its just hilarious because if they did it start of wipe nbd. But they let the high levels stockpile and then fucked all of us who just unlocked it

[2023-01-09 18:50:56] <doomsdayclock4> EZ solution to extract campers, just wait until 20 seconds left in the raid like me
[2023-01-09 18:51:00] <Kasiimir_> i think the changes are garbage
[2023-01-09 18:51:03] <%bucknasty_ttv> what all things did they remove?
[2023-01-09 18:51:07] <%+kingcobracy> I remember you saying a few wipes ago optics were way too easy to get with how powerful they are

[2023-01-09 18:52:02] <%+nog00d4u> @bucknasty_ttv i wont lie.. i kinda liked the cracked scavs the first week of wipe
[2023-01-09 18:52:03] <+TheTommyStick> it's interesting seeing the different responses to the ammo changes lol. Some folks are saying they're gonna quit, some folks saying it's kinda lit
[2023-01-09 18:52:05] <%thelastleroy> I tried that jump down into marked the first time and fell all the way down when I jumped back out the window......oof
[2023-01-09 18:52:11] <+Aaaarrrgg> @Aaaarrrgg Im not saying this case specifically. just in general. its not ALWAYS an extract camp

[2023-01-09 18:52:24] <%+asoupsandwich> what are the ammo changes? is there a link?

[2023-01-09 18:52:53] <+BazHicks> @Aaaarrrgg dont think anyone is saying it is, we were all talking about the man who became a bird setting up a nest KEKW
[2023-01-09 18:52:54] <%flappin_fatties> only people that will quit cuz of the ammo changes are the ones that use meta ammo and guns as a crutch for shitty gameplay
[2023-01-09 18:52:55] <doomsdayclock4> @willerz there's a twitch streamer called "Exfil Camper" and that's all he does OMEGALUL
[2023-01-09 18:52:57] <+TheTommyStick> I've been a few chats today lol, some folks definitely upsetti spaghetti, cuz apparently this hurts "the casuals", but everybody definition of casual so different
[2023-01-09 18:53:08] <+Aaaarrrgg> @axdragon1105 Are you flexing someone else's play time? I'm going to ignore you now. I didn't say he wasn't extract camped, was just commenting on gaming in general

[2023-01-09 18:56:15] <+johngjohn> is it pmcs or ai kls?
[2023-01-09 18:56:18] <+PewZapDie> @thelastleroy every kill with the Toz brings you closer to the promise land
[2023-01-09 18:56:19] <patharr> you werent able to wear ears with the ushanka before right?
[2023-01-09 18:56:22] <%+pocketacez_> well a helmet wouldnt help against getting head eyes'd either so its all the same
[2023-01-09 18:56:26] <+TheTommyStick> Cuz I assumed casual meant you got like, 5-8 hours in a week.

[2023-01-09 19:17:06] <schwabbyy> what does it even do in the game if it doesn't give hip fire bonus anymore..
[2023-01-09 19:17:13] <+BazHicks> he did via the flee earlier, but i think that was during the change over
[2023-01-09 19:17:16] <%ehrnsburns> @34camo but it did give hip fire accuracy right?

[2023-01-09 20:41:15] <+TheTommyStick> @iSnipeLikeJesus there's a mechanic barter for a gun that has it, and you can buy it on flea.
[2023-01-09 20:41:16] <TicklinToes> I already have max traders tho so why punish someone who has grinded it already
[2023-01-09 20:41:16] <mugiwarachemz> im scared to go to woods now
[2023-01-09 20:41:18] <%iSnipeLikeJesus> I think the changes to the scopes is an L. It's just going to make it so the sweaty chads have another advantage over little Timmy who won't be able to afford them anymore

[2023-01-09 20:42:05] <%iSnipeLikeJesus> @TheTommyStick People are only putting it on flea for ridiculous barters. Good call on the gun trade though. Didn't know that

[2023-01-09 20:43:42] <TicklinToes> In my opinion it’s a big L. They could have just locked them behind max traders or something. The vudu was already locked behind a long task line

[2023-01-09 21:39:39] <%+highplainsdrifter> Cheaters in every game but Tarkov hits different cause theres more at stake or at least it feels different in Tarkov
[2023-01-09 21:39:41] <trippiii60> LOL
[2023-01-09 21:39:42] <+TheTommyStick> they should unlock Labs, just so cheaters go back to their natural habitat
[2023-01-09 21:39:43] <%ObeseSn0wman> Lighthouse has too much good loot, they need to go back to sacrificing labs as the cheaters go to map
[2023-01-09 21:39:43] <%+bigbuttpotatoes> @SlickityRickity yes cause lighthouse boss has thermal sniper
[2023-01-09 21:39:44] <%okxcomputer> how much is a fuckin cheat? btw man people have money

[2023-01-09 22:25:19] <StellarReality> they pretty expensive
[2023-01-09 22:25:20] <%+keeglerelf98> How are you getting on lighthouse in your scav it’s taking me 15 minutes still no game
[2023-01-09 22:25:26] <ShatterSide> @JDiamatti Probably not worth the hassle. And the loss wouldn't be worth the price different for most people. But you do you! If gaming is your main hobby, then it's not THAT much money at the end of the day. but it's kinda like buying a new car every two years. It's a huge expense since it just loses it's value by like 20% the second it drives off the lot.

[2023-01-09 22:26:27] <%JDiamatti> @ShatterSide Yeah I agree. Probably not worth the loss of cash plus hassle of selling it etc. I probably shouldn't upgrade anything for like 3-4 years at least realistically. This game is gonna run the same for me I think as well
[2023-01-09 22:26:33] <%+UnsightedOne> @keeglerelf98 Damn, Willerz must just have that strimmer luck...

[2023-01-09 22:48:32] <%Spin_My_Dreidel> It just makes the game harder for those that don't level up quickly, which also makes it harder for those that don't start right away at wipe.
[2023-01-09 22:48:34] <%+BranFlakes4> @JDiamatti I also really love getting cool ammo and parts over the course of a few raids and making project guns. So I understand I play the game different from others.
[2023-01-09 22:48:41] <!%MadDogHux> 40 meters is 131 ish feet
[2023-01-09 22:48:44] <%+kingcobracy> I feel like it doesn't track vertical if that wasn't 40
[2023-01-09 22:48:46] <%+trevandezz> @WillerZ that kev guy is streaming right now and he's 100% cheating lmao
[2023-01-09 22:48:51] <+pluto1v> @willerz how do you feel about the ammo change? And will you be taking viewer kits to avoid it?
[2023-01-09 22:48:57] <+RedemptionFall> When you get down a 3 man squad with Pst starting ammo on a MP5, mmm, good feelings
[2023-01-09 22:48:59] <%+LaggingNLooting> them removing the optics makes little sense...
[2023-01-09 22:48:59] <MystoR6> @ThatGuyEnGi What CPU you will get with that kit ?
[2023-01-09 22:49:09] <%JDiamatti> @BranFlakes4 Yeah I personally am VERY hard to displease, I finally found the mental route/method of shaking off dickhead cheaters so any game changes Im like meh, I will always love Tarkov

[2023-01-09 22:50:08] <+chowsietv> the only element I can't handle is ammo diff. There comes a point in every wipe I just stop playing because I don't have the time to grind it, and every raid I just get clapped by some dude I mag dumped into.

[2023-01-09 23:51:28] <%Spin_My_Dreidel> m80 isn't doing too hot this wipe either, for me.
[2023-01-09 23:51:28] <%+Plowpatine> What in the absolute scav nerf
[2023-01-09 23:51:29] <oggebulleglass> M80 better early imo
[2023-01-09 23:51:32] <rollatorsved> Top load with m61, m62 have been bad a long time
[2023-01-09 23:51:35] <+xVersify> Hey, anyone know what the reward for grenadier is now that BP is gone?
[2023-01-09 23:51:36] <%+yarpx> no player can kill willerz, but apparently the cracked scav can LOL
[2023-01-09 23:51:36] <%og_thundercat> m62 has been bad for 3 wipes for me
[2023-01-09 23:51:39] <@%SmittyKels0> Shoot some BCP and make them feel it.
[2023-01-09 23:51:40] <%GrabMeABeerPlz> I was in Reserve earlier . In the staircases around the helo and was looking through a window. Random SCAV spawned 3 steps behind me and rip xD
[2023-01-09 23:51:42] <%MikeWilliams1990> I’ve been head shot killed by 9mm pst more than anything thisnwipe
[2023-01-09 23:51:43] <AlienNamedDave> @WillerZ is it because he was naked? m6s overpenn?
[2023-01-09 23:51:53] <%Spin_My_Dreidel> T4 armor tanking m80s like t5 usually
[2023-01-09 23:51:55] <AlienNamedDave> m62s
[2023-01-09 23:51:57] <mojden> Svd sniper scavs are pain
[2023-01-09 23:52:03] <@%getfarked> BCP some slept on ammo
[2023-01-09 23:52:05] <mojden> Especially when they have ps rounds lol
[2023-01-09 23:52:05] <%its_tony_time> @AlienNamedDave there's no such thing as 'overpen' in tarkov
[2023-01-09 23:52:10] <%og_thundercat> @AlienNamedDave m62 doesnt overpen anything
[2023-01-09 23:52:27] <@%SmittyKels0> m62 is nearly identical to m80

[2023-01-09 23:52:45] <AlienNamedDave> I remember that being a thing in the past. I missed 2 wipes tho @og_thundercat @its_tony_time
[2023-01-09 23:53:03] <%+misticalmuslim> @WillerZ have you tried any of the UBGL s yet?
[2023-01-09 23:53:10] <tahoee> What is this thing doing with two walkie-talkies?
[2023-01-09 23:53:14] <+aybird> i love the dvl
[2023-01-09 23:53:22] <%og_thundercat> @AlienNamedDave m62 is m80 with a tracer and a recoil reduction stat
[2023-01-09 23:53:23] VIEWERS: 2 307
[2023-01-09 23:53:27] <+srt_perry> are dvl's cheap again?

[2023-01-09 23:54:15] <AlienNamedDave> @og_thundercat that's fine. I still remember some rounds had an overpenn issue in the past so I was just asking
[2023-01-09 23:54:27] <+srt_perry> 30k for a dvl and 40k for a pimped out mp9 secondary. That combo was deadly
[2023-01-09 23:54:52] <+LordPelto> dont mind me just here to add my complaint about the ammo changes as well LOL

[2023-01-09 23:55:33] <+srt_perry> ammo changes werent significant imo - I crafted all my 762 bp anyway. 45 ap was the biggest game changer imo
[2023-01-09 23:55:37] <%HB12> I mean on his PMC ive never seen them in game @getfarked

[2023-01-09 23:55:58] <+LordPelto> @srt_perry not getting M80 until lvl 37 through trader is dumb
[2023-01-09 23:56:13] <+LordPelto> bc at lvl 30 you'll prob just craft m61 anyway
[2023-01-09 23:56:16] <%+ZeltaraTV> m80 is only like 100-15 m/s faster @WillerZ
[2023-01-09 23:56:18] <%+drduck1027> maybe time to make a !endurance

[2023-01-09 23:56:24] <+LordPelto> so locking m80 behind PK4 seems dumb to me

[2023-01-09 23:57:43] <%lane196> Was curious if the vudu will still be available after the quest or if they are gone completely, and flee only now
