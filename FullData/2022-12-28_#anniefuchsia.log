[2022-12-28 15:15:59] <%Sne4ky79> @AnnieFuchsia @MrBladexx  blade asked if it is it normal or heroic raid tonight?
[2022-12-28 15:15:59] <%+Sarocus> Only for tasks and killing the attacking mobs
[2022-12-28 15:16:02] <%Belandrial> The boss spawns give rep
[2022-12-28 15:16:10] <%Wardrick7> yes, unless its group defend the soup when quality increases
[2022-12-28 15:16:13] <%MrBladexx> IF you get a fishing of buying task. then you havce to do them to get rep.
[2022-12-28 15:16:20] <%Rolaz> reward from quest can drop ingredient for craft, quite useful one, can save you some money =)
[2022-12-28 15:16:20] <%Qelvue> both
[2022-12-28 15:16:45] <%MrBladexx> @Sne4ky79 thanks for asking for me again :D :D
[2022-12-28 15:16:48] <%kirosofiqneca> at what time is the raid annie?
[2022-12-28 15:16:57] <%PanicRush> you cant fail it LUL
[2022-12-28 15:16:58] <%Wardrick7> you cant fail
[2022-12-28 15:17:05] <%Collnaris> you didn't fail
[2022-12-28 15:17:05] <%Mirkooo> Stirred too smol Sadge
[2022-12-28 15:17:09] <%Sne4ky79> @MrBladexx no worries <2
[2022-12-28 15:17:10] <%+SpoofAvatar> sometimes you can't get all 5 tasks completed
[2022-12-28 15:17:16] <%jokuTM> it did
[2022-12-28 15:17:18] <%+6ix_4our_> No soup for you!
[2022-12-28 15:17:18] <%Rolaz> it did

[2022-12-28 15:17:29] <%Mirkooo> @Collnaris Hell yeah KKona
[2022-12-28 15:17:35] <%PanicRush> probably because the timer ended
[2022-12-28 15:17:38] <%+Sarocus> You dont actually have to participate. As long as a task assigned to you gets completed, you get the rep
[2022-12-28 15:17:40] <%jokuTM> Oh, i was thinking the weekly quest
[2022-12-28 15:17:41] <+rorsel> u need to be there at the beginning
[2022-12-28 15:17:50] <%+SpoofAvatar> you have to go again in 3.5 hours

[2022-12-28 15:18:14] <%PanicRush> you probably want to hand it in on sunday with DMF buff for extra rep @AnnieFuchsia
[2022-12-28 15:18:32] <%Rolaz> if too many people participating, sometimes you cant complete all 5 tasks in one feast
[2022-12-28 15:18:34] <%PanicRush> keep the soup quest for DMF as well
[2022-12-28 15:18:38] <%PanicRush> it gives 500 rep

[2022-12-28 17:29:25] <%PanicRush> fantastic beasts movie pretty much confirms it
[2022-12-28 17:29:26] <%+Banjo586> well he is gay in the new movies
[2022-12-28 17:29:30] <%+ehall416> i mean there was the thing about cho chang. the story did have some pretty questionable stuff
[2022-12-28 17:29:31] <%MrBladexx> @elohraa pretty much yeah
[2022-12-28 17:29:32] <%+golstat2003> It's not a rumor, JK straight said he was gay
[2022-12-28 17:29:35] <%drzaius30> @Swiggyswoo_ not crazy at all lots of old money
[2022-12-28 17:29:37] <+CatatonicCataclysm> as a trans person i find it hard to do anything about jk rowling, i mean, her opinions aare awful but she's a rich person, there's nothing I can do about it
[2022-12-28 17:29:42] <%bYTEfROG> yeah she did during a reading
[2022-12-28 17:29:48] <%Arthannis> what time is normal raid?
[2022-12-28 17:30:03] <rustycans> @CatatonicCataclysm What about everything you use from China madd with slavery
[2022-12-28 17:30:07] <%AnanasACE> it doesn't beneefit any of the storylines, so it is completely irrelevant if he is gay or straight or whatever
[2022-12-28 17:30:08] <%Swiggyswoo_> I don't even care who creates anything I consume, I wouldnt even know her name if not for twitter people hating on her OMEGALUL
[2022-12-28 17:30:14] <+casssin> How many of you anti-JKR people realize Lord of their Rings movies had been produced by HARVEY WEINSTEIN?
[2022-12-28 17:30:32] <+CatatonicCataclysm> @rustycans there is slavery in america too just in us prisons

[2022-12-28 17:32:15] <+CatatonicCataclysm> @rustycans and my discussion is that america is no better than china, end of discussion, hope this helps
[2022-12-28 17:32:21] <%MrBladexx> there is no reason arguing in a chat like this. if you wanna talk/argue about it. take it in private.

[2022-12-28 18:21:56] <%Dieks77> for ultimate it is indeed 30 days extra
[2022-12-28 18:22:01] <%OJ_Hype> because of the promo, every edition gets a free 30
[2022-12-28 18:22:07] <%Sne4ky79> For a Limited Time, get an extra 30 Days of Game Time when you buy Dragonflight*

[2022-12-28 18:47:09] <Jonesy4> oh nice ty
[2022-12-28 18:47:50] <%Twigbot4k> Went bear druid.  Shocked.. totally shocked, bear has mangle!  Feral lost it.  Bear hits HARD, feral tickles foes.  Bear takes little damage.  Feral takes tons of dmg.  Bear has feedback style dps synergies, so strong!  Feral has.. a great look from legion, so.. yay?  :)
[2022-12-28 18:48:29] <%Collnaris> oh you have the cd talent for convoke
[2022-12-28 18:48:33] <%Twigbot4k> So def leveling as bear druid.  RIP feral druid play.

[2022-12-28 18:53:25] <%Twigbot4k> DF feral, for the first time, to me, seems viable to reduce to a castsequence macro.  Just one macro play.  And be fine.
[2022-12-28 18:54:04] <%Twigbot4k> Did the happy DF druid player mention _what_ they like about DF feral play?
[2022-12-28 18:54:14] <%PanicRush> Pog
[2022-12-28 18:54:29] <%Twigbot4k> That curiously, NO one talks about.  They just say they enjoy DF feral, but not _why_.
[2022-12-28 18:54:36] <%+nowshido> I don't know feral but he just loves how it plays and loves that he can do a ton of dps now

[2022-12-28 18:54:57] <%Twigbot4k> odd, at 180 ilvl after the boost, it feels to me like a zero dps spec.

[2022-12-28 18:56:26] <%Twigbot4k> The silly thing, I also boosted a marks hunter and surv hunter.  They have it extremely silly easy, and do _far_ more dps than feral does in 180 ilvl gear.  Next to try is a WW monk, I heard they also destroy foes outright easily.

[2022-12-28 18:57:52] <%Twigbot4k> Once you hit 70, the gear spread starts to vary significantly.  It's much harder to fairly judge how a spec's mechanics play out, when one alt is 340, one is 360, and one is 375 is well tuned gear.

[2022-12-28 19:32:12] <%Enoz___> chicken is fine, curry is borderline, pineapple is just no, and banana is go away demon.
[2022-12-28 19:32:49] <%Sne4ky79> pineapple goes well with the salty ham

[2022-12-28 19:33:42] <%Qelvue> I think the issue with having either pineapple or banana on pizza, is that it has to be done right, there is no middle ground.

[2022-12-28 22:24:12] <Exedol_85> @anniefuchsia Hey annie, I bought a keyboard K100 and a gaming mouse scimitar, the mouse works great, I'm happy with it, but my keyboard doesn't work or doesn't light up.  My PC doesn't detect it by itself not even iCUE and it is up to date.  My question is do you have to do something to start it or does it start its own when you plug it in?  Already made a return request.
