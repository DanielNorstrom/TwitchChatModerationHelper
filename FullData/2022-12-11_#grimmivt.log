[2022-12-11 06:31:53] <chef_frideezy> Forbidden West looked pretty and that’s it
[2022-12-11 06:31:54] <@%Extrafuzzy> I didnt get to play Horizon 2
[2022-12-11 06:31:56] <!socialistOtter> Grimmi, that's a fine opinion to have, people just got mad about devs being like
[2022-12-11 06:32:00] <@%KitsuneKitEN> Dont worry grimmi, thats how i felt about gow 2018, it honestly wasnt a great game imo
[2022-12-11 06:32:04] <@%Extrafuzzy> so im looking forward to it
[2022-12-11 06:32:10] <%nerdsquid> its the guy
[2022-12-11 06:32:12] <%solidoutlaw> I had just finished BOTW before horizon, and the traversal in horizon wasn't nearly as fun

[2022-12-11 06:32:29] <%Angry_Opposum> No skip it
[2022-12-11 06:32:29] <!socialistOtter> really dismissive of games with different design philosophies

[2022-12-11 06:32:54] <%$HeroUnit23> What did they even say?
[2022-12-11 06:32:56] <berserkboi1> can anyone tell me who the hell is Ludwig
[2022-12-11 06:33:03] <%KingPotatoXII> yeah Bayo 3 deserved it
[2022-12-11 06:33:07] <%+CainsLupus> it okay Grimmi, no one cares about the Last of Us show.
[2022-12-11 06:33:09] <@%Extrafuzzy> bayo
[2022-12-11 06:33:09] <Confused_Druid> @berserkboi1 He's a huge streamer
[2022-12-11 06:33:13] <!%7192_ch> the new god of wars seem to only selective care about the older games that kind of bothers me
[2022-12-11 06:33:19] <!+Jignx> Horizon isnt bad, it's just bland since other open world games are better
[2022-12-11 06:33:19] <%$SomberApoc> yes, Bayo 3
[2022-12-11 06:33:20] <kingkutta23> Tbh they shouldn’t have revealed mando’s face

[2022-12-11 06:34:24] <%alphtax> fr they weren't havin any after mr judge was up there
[2022-12-11 06:34:24] <%KingPotatoXII> like I said they have to crunch everyone's speeches because Kratos took up most of the time
[2022-12-11 06:34:28] <!+Jignx> Christopher Judge helped people win 20 more steam decks
[2022-12-11 06:34:34] <!+Jignx> and he wasnt finished with his speech too!
[2022-12-11 06:34:38] <%k_yama_> this is what happens when someone takes too much time on their speech, they're forced to rush ppl due to time constraints

[2022-12-11 06:35:22] <%$SomberApoc> I distrust Amazon Games
[2022-12-11 06:35:26] <berserkboi1> oh
[2022-12-11 06:35:26] <%Angry_Opposum> Amazon games? they aren't dead?
[2022-12-11 06:35:28] <Maethra> yeah there's no way this game will be good
[2022-12-11 06:35:34] <berserkboi1> funny dinosaur game?
[2022-12-11 06:35:35] <Maethra> it's a genshin like mmo
[2022-12-11 06:35:38] <!+Jignx> I have no hope in this because its amazon games, all the MMOs they run are massively mishandled

[2022-12-11 06:36:17] <%RomeoEchoDelta> I have 0 faith in this game.
[2022-12-11 06:36:19] <!socialistOtter> how'd they get bandai namco to sign on
[2022-12-11 06:36:20] <%AbsoluteMenhera> Genshin Impact x Jeff Bezos
[2022-12-11 06:36:33] <!+Jignx> Grimmi just calls every japanese game genshin impact now
[2022-12-11 06:36:35] <%RomeoEchoDelta> This looks like the Tales of Arise engine.
[2022-12-11 06:36:58] <kingkutta23> Seen this pop on YouTube ads and didn’t really have high hopes for it
[2022-12-11 06:37:00] <%k_yama_> every game amazon has had a hand in was handled super poorly
[2022-12-11 06:37:06] <%monononny> every game is one of two things: Genshin, or Dark Souls
[2022-12-11 06:37:13] <%AshenLongbow> there is something about this artstyle though, yea... it all looks a little samey
[2022-12-11 06:37:15] <%monononny> these are just facts
[2022-12-11 06:37:17] <Maethra> a lot lol
[2022-12-11 06:37:19] <!%7192_ch> it does look a little bit like genshin

[2022-12-11 06:38:21] <kingkutta23> I like this one because it was somewhat similar to  ELEX
[2022-12-11 06:38:22] <@%Extrafuzzy> Genshin Impact 2
[2022-12-11 06:38:26] <Confused_Druid> This is the Dark Souls game with guns right?
[2022-12-11 06:38:30] <%k_yama_> Remnant from the Ashes 2

[2022-12-11 06:45:27] <berserkboi1> animal is a true gamer

[2022-12-11 06:45:37] <%$SomberApoc> Best Score, this is gonna be good
[2022-12-11 06:45:38] <%KingPotatoXII> best score pog
[2022-12-11 06:45:38] <%jonathanantoine> is the video a little quiet or just me?
[2022-12-11 06:45:41] <!socialistOtter> I hope Kojima collabs with the muppets. I have never considered this possibility before now

[2022-12-11 06:45:57] <!%7192_ch> he could literally just have a death stranding delivery be a box of muppets that talk as you deliver them
[2022-12-11 06:45:59] <%$SomberApoc> Hellsinger was some Fire
[2022-12-11 06:46:01] <!+Jignx> are vtubers just muppets?

[2022-12-11 06:46:51] <%$HeroUnit23> Xenoblade's music was fantastic
[2022-12-11 06:46:52] <berserkboi1> that is kinda bullshit to me

[2022-12-11 06:47:07] <Confused_Druid> @KingPotatoXII Exactly
[2022-12-11 06:47:19] <%$HeroUnit23> All official reward shows are rigged
[2022-12-11 06:47:23] <!+Jignx> so its corruption
[2022-12-11 06:47:42] <@%Extrafuzzy> you can just say RIGGED like all of us boss
[2022-12-11 06:47:43] <!%7192_ch> The critics basically determine who wins for the most part and the critics are very influenced by sony
[2022-12-11 06:47:45] <@%KitsuneKitEN> Idk, i listened to a bit of the xenoblade music and it to me it just felt like average "JRPG of the month" music? Definitely prefer both god of war and elden ring

[2022-12-11 06:48:03] <%$SomberApoc> There's weighted voting, is all
[2022-12-11 06:48:03] <berserkboi1> cuckmann?
[2022-12-11 06:48:17] <%solidoutlaw> isn't is also that the people who cover it just don't have the time to cover every game that comes out?
[2022-12-11 06:48:23] <%jonathanantoine> to use a more crude term, a 'circlejerk'
[2022-12-11 06:48:24] <@%Extrafuzzy> The Last of us 2 Won and everyone hated that
[2022-12-11 06:48:28] <%+nachtigalfinn> Oh yeah I remember that.
[2022-12-11 06:48:29] <%$SomberApoc> And that's what cemented the fail state of TGA
[2022-12-11 06:48:50] <rocketeer_c> We shouldn't value things based on what does and doesn't have an award, really.
[2022-12-11 06:48:54] <%echo_chamber_7776> don't nod? why :)
[2022-12-11 06:48:56] <Confused_Druid> @solidoutlaw Well yeah, but you'd think they'd at least play the nominees once
[2022-12-11 06:49:00] <!+Jignx> but grimmi, there was a disclaimer that stated that online votes are only a small percentage of the decision for GOTY
[2022-12-11 06:49:01] <%KingPotatoXII> oooh this looks good
[2022-12-11 06:49:02] <%$HeroUnit23> Don't nod was the LiS studio, I thought
[2022-12-11 06:49:03] <!%7192_ch> this is so awkward without the audio lmao
[2022-12-11 06:49:08] <%solidoutlaw> like signalis came out to raving reviews but didn't even get nominated despite coming out 2 weeks before GoWR
[2022-12-11 06:49:15] <Maethra> this game looks neat
[2022-12-11 06:49:30] <%KingPotatoXII> why is the volume still so low?
[2022-12-11 06:49:35] <%NamePendingVT> @solidoutlaw loved that game
[2022-12-11 06:49:43] <+fogcloud_> tga is a bit of a popularity contest sometimes

[2022-12-11 06:50:37] <%solidoutlaw> I always just tell people that you shouldn't be upset if your game doesn't win at the VGAs, because there's a lot of great games and there's no way your favorite's gonna win what you want
[2022-12-11 06:50:45] <berserkboi1> I feel like god of war isn't really fair because ps5 exclusivity and it coming out so close

[2022-12-11 06:51:16] <%solidoutlaw> if I had it my way, signalis would be up there for best narrative, indie, and game of the year, but yeah.

[2022-12-11 06:51:55] <%SlipMcDrip> There is no entry point just play any game
[2022-12-11 06:51:57] <%+nachtigalfinn> Here is the thing about Warhammer, Grimmi, it's kind of like porn? It's about the experience, not the lore.
[2022-12-11 06:51:59] <Confused_Druid> There's the table top game, the novels, the games
[2022-12-11 06:52:01] <%+zutor64> just go with whatever
[2022-12-11 06:52:02] <%RomeoEchoDelta> They 100% do
[2022-12-11 06:52:03] <%AshenLongbow> darktide is a good entry point
[2022-12-11 06:52:08] <%czerno333> darktide is good, you don't need to know much of the lore to just wack zombies in the face with a shovel
[2022-12-11 06:52:11] <Starfyre687> All you need to know about Warhammer is that, in the Grim Dark Future, there is only War
[2022-12-11 06:52:12] <angeryaboutelves> i know almost nothing about the lore but the few games i've played seemed easy enough to get into
[2022-12-11 06:52:14] <!%7192_ch> Dawn of War is good if you like RTS, Mechanicus is good for Turn Based Strategy, Space Marine is a third person thing
[2022-12-11 06:52:14] <%AshenLongbow> just don't have anything to do with the tabletop :3
[2022-12-11 06:52:16] <%the5thedward> total war warhammer is also pretty good. But I also just like strategy games

[2022-12-11 06:53:03] <angeryaboutelves> also 40k fans will get angry at you if you say its based on starcraft
[2022-12-11 06:53:09] <%fabgutwich> @solidoutlaw ultimately they're "just marketing" but we get to see cool stuff grimmi14Grimmilin

[2022-12-11 06:59:47] <!%7192_ch> i wish this one would show more of what the games actually did for the accessibility

[2022-12-11 07:00:17] <Starfyre687> God of War's accessibility is based on Last of Us's changes, but made better
[2022-12-11 07:00:19] <Maethra> what accessibility feature did GoW innovate on lol
[2022-12-11 07:00:21] BITS: monononny (100)
[2022-12-11 07:00:21] <%monononny> Cheer100 WEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEOOOOOOOOOOOOO you're killing mee
[2022-12-11 07:00:33] <%thephantom900> god of war had a lot of the same  features
[2022-12-11 07:00:35] <%RomeoEchoDelta> Seems a little over the top.
[2022-12-11 07:00:37] <@%KitsuneKitEN> Only played god of war but it had a crazy amount of settings for accessibility, thats all i know.
[2022-12-11 07:00:42] <!socialistOtter> I don't know if I believe any of these actually innovated whatsoever in accessibility
[2022-12-11 07:00:45] <OatsMate> @Maethra It hasn't. It's just got a lot of them, and I mean, a lot of them.
[2022-12-11 07:00:45] <%Angry_Opposum> Yeah it had like a bat sonar accessibility feature, it was wild
[2022-12-11 07:00:50] <!+Jignx> @Maethra the part where they told you how to solve the puzzles
[2022-12-11 07:00:57] <Maethra> LOL
[2022-12-11 07:00:57] <%monononny> in minecraft or something
[2022-12-11 07:01:03] <%czerno333> one thing these AAA games are pretty good about is accessibility
[2022-12-11 07:01:07] <@%Extrafuzzy> wow no music yet
[2022-12-11 07:01:21] <Starfyre687> GoW honestly deserved it
[2022-12-11 07:01:23] <OatsMate> Imagine being a bat.
[2022-12-11 07:01:24] <@%Extrafuzzy> nvm

[2022-12-11 07:01:47] <OatsMate> We're mording!
[2022-12-11 07:01:50] <ohyeahthatsabaseball> accessibility is cool when it's just a setting rather than the base game

[2022-12-11 07:03:04] <%$SomberApoc> If they fixed their movement and the combat being floaty it might be worth

[2022-12-11 07:08:34] <%$HeroUnit23> Surprised Tunic made top five tho
[2022-12-11 07:08:35] <%$SomberApoc> I hope FF wins
[2022-12-11 07:08:38] <%RomeoEchoDelta> I don't think Genshin deserves any awards.
[2022-12-11 07:08:40] <!+Jignx> sonic was winning hard until sonic fans drew art of sonic characters being violent to genshin ones which got the attention of the chiense who then voted fairly for genshin to win hard

[2022-12-11 07:09:08] <@%KitsuneKitEN> @Jignx "Who then voted fairly" sounds really desperate and that entire vote was a shitshow kitsun268Deadinside
[2022-12-11 07:09:10] <Maethra> releasing next to Elden Ring made everyone forget it
[2022-12-11 07:09:10] <berserkboi1> consider all the Chinese players in genshin alone
[2022-12-11 07:09:22] <%czerno333> they keep releasing horizon games at the worst times. the first one got released at the same time as BOTW, the 2nd one got released at the same time as Elden Ring
[2022-12-11 07:09:43] <!+Jignx> the moral is that sonic fans shouldnt have gloated so early and they could have kept the win

[2022-12-11 07:11:11] <!socialistOtter> they were definitely angry
[2022-12-11 07:11:17] <%AshenLongbow> elden ring was too much of a colossus, too anticipated, a juggernaut of gaming

[2022-12-11 07:40:27] <%$Kloost> so lost and clueless i am
[2022-12-11 07:40:31] <%King__Froggo> that kid was the cherry on top of one of the best award shows ive seen
[2022-12-11 07:40:34] <%Robbaz_Korgi> He's done this before with the free hong kong thing a few years ago
[2022-12-11 07:40:34] <%k_yama_> kid genuinely pisses me off. the entire focus on ppl rewatching that is solely on him and ruins their acceptance speech
[2022-12-11 07:40:35] <PC_4S_H> OKAY BUT IT GETS BETTER I PROMISE
[2022-12-11 07:40:42] <Rorckor> If you go back to when they walked up to stage, you will see him walk down the aisle.
[2022-12-11 07:40:43] <%King__Froggo> haven't laughed that hard in a while
[2022-12-11 07:40:45] <nerdmeistere> people were calling for him to be arrested but what law did he technically break?
[2022-12-11 07:40:46] <The_SaltiestPretzel> Dude had the fear of Geoff put into him in the dressing room I'm sure
[2022-12-11 07:40:48] <%TacticalCocaine1> congratulations bill clinton

[2022-12-11 07:41:05] <%justawrestlingfan21> Heist of the century
[2022-12-11 07:41:06] <!+Jignx> I like how the kid tried to get into the mic a few times and mumbled at the start so the director thought it was another speaker and turned down the music, masterful play
[2022-12-11 07:41:10] <%RomeoEchoDelta> He just said something. There's no meaning behind it.
[2022-12-11 07:41:10] <%elringou> he just a little guy
[2022-12-11 07:41:14] <%AshenLongbow> it wasn't even his first time pulling something like that
[2022-12-11 07:41:15] <%the5thedward> @nerdmeistere trespassing and he's a minor so I do see him facing any real consequences
[2022-12-11 07:41:18] <!%GinjiVitis> William Clinton's PR manager is WILD
