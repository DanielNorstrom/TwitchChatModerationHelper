[2023-01-06 10:19:34] <Dankotron> is the video
[2023-01-06 10:19:37] <%$GGuts> Gfn is especially attractive to console players that want to experience some PC games.
[2023-01-06 10:19:39] <%JoshuaColossus> The only downside is they don't have every title you may want. Everything else is pretty awesome.

[2023-01-06 10:41:56] <%djuice_> Basically replace and rename 3080 tier to Ultimate.
[2023-01-06 10:42:20] <+pompeyhammer> would guess 3080 might drop to a lower price or go onto the low paid tier instead

[2023-01-06 10:44:20] <%djuice_> 4080 is about the same price as a 3080, it doesnt use anymore power.

[2023-01-06 10:51:13] <wingnasty12> Most games are crap now anyway. Games 10 years old are better than most of the new ones. They turn them out to quick. No hate on you
[2023-01-06 10:51:15] <+WorkersNutts> would be amazing if we could trade digital games one day

[2023-01-06 10:54:05] <Colaide> I'm a console gamer.  I haven't had a physical copy in years. PC doesn't have a drive either

[2023-01-06 10:54:14] <ElasmoFan> Google literally dropped Stadia then jumped to GFN a week later
[2023-01-06 10:54:20] <ElasmoFan> and started promoting it with their chromebooks
[2023-01-06 10:54:22] <Protejae> I do like the physicals copies too... its sad we will never be able to enjoy a game if we go into a zombie apocalypse.. js... digital is good but super bad at same time..

[2023-01-06 10:54:29] <Warblazer> There is the concern for stuff disappearing. If the service goes down, there might be stuff that just disappears forever @BurkeBlack

[2023-01-06 10:54:54] <%Lerekh> @Protejae i think there would be more things to be concerned about
[2023-01-06 10:55:01] <ElasmoFan> I think they mean digital games in general
[2023-01-06 10:55:03] <ElasmoFan> not geforce now
[2023-01-06 10:55:05] <%+prfella> @Protejae I think if a zombie apocalypse breaks out, playing video games would be at the bottom of to do list
[2023-01-06 10:55:08] <Warblazer> I mean just in general for streaming stuff @BurkeBlack Not specifically Gforce now
[2023-01-06 10:55:11] <nicedevill> SHOCKING!
[2023-01-06 10:55:15] <dzxbeast> if steam or epic service closed down - your games would be gone. i think thats what he meant
[2023-01-06 10:55:16] <wingnasty12> You cant sell them though
[2023-01-06 10:55:16] <Protejae> Lol.. naw you would need to have some fun after slaying some zombies

[2023-01-06 10:55:21] <wiggle_everytime_boop> I want to use cheat engine with gfn.
[2023-01-06 10:55:26] <+angryhonkinggoose> GeForce now remove and add supported games all the time
[2023-01-06 10:55:29] <$GunnyShavedPaws> I like the steam model, your games are in a cloud somewhere. Streaming games sucks because of latency.
[2023-01-06 10:55:30] <+Really_OReilly> Does your own computer need to have the same specs as the game you play - or is that only needed for the server computer
[2023-01-06 10:55:32] <%+Spellbot5000> Steam might go down. It's tough for that company to survive on in the infinite money they earn.
[2023-01-06 10:55:33] <%Rool_Gonzalez> Maybe he means game SAVES,where are those stored,in Cloud?
[2023-01-06 10:55:35] <wiggle_everytime_boop> Does it handle cheat engine well?
[2023-01-06 10:55:36] <Warblazer> There has been stuff that has been erased from the internet
[2023-01-06 10:55:39] <PKM4STER> steam wont give you anything LUL
[2023-01-06 10:55:44] <TitanRoboDuck> Well now you are talking Physical vs Digital. I think more people prefere a Digital download as that will give the best preformance and basicly no latentsy. Where when you are streaming Interactive media there are always gonna be latensy.

[2023-01-06 10:56:31] <Protejae> I tried it, It streams your games from there servers.. If you own the game you own the cloud or a piece of the free cloud
[2023-01-06 10:56:34] <ElasmoFan> it's like going to your friends place and logging in to your steam account on their computer

[2023-01-06 10:57:07] <+angryhonkinggoose> Wasnt Steam like you dont really "own" the games, its just a renting period until Steam goes out of service?
[2023-01-06 10:57:08] <%+RadarFreak> You worried about losing games when all our money is digital and could easily be compromised by several means, EMP's, Hackermans, I mean we live in a digital age. Is what it is.
[2023-01-06 10:57:09] <+Civrill> @BurkeBlack you think there will ever be a connection of xbox game pass with gforce now?
[2023-01-06 10:57:11] <dzxbeast> steam said they would make sure that player have access to their games. what about other laucnher like epic, ea or ubisoft? all my digital gaes over there would be gone forever @BurkeBlack
[2023-01-06 10:57:18] <+reddjarum> I like Geforce Now for the reason , you dont have to install games you own , you can just play them

[2023-01-06 11:03:08] <+phantomsthirdeye> I understand Geforce will have a wide variety of games. It will be nice if they had all games that are sold

[2023-01-06 11:04:07] <Shivalla> @lamarrwilson Needs to be quite a new TV, for example the best LG televisions from 2021 support it but lower ones doesn't. 2022 LGwebOS has built in support tho.
[2023-01-06 11:04:10] <%+prfella> D:
[2023-01-06 11:04:12] <%+Spellbot5000> I mean, can you reall support GFN when they don't implement some sort of time-tunneling tech to offer games from the future that haven't been released yet? Seems like a big stumbling block.
[2023-01-06 11:04:14] <+phantomsthirdeye> I see, I would feel Publishers will be okay with the Idea. @PKM4STER

[2023-01-06 11:04:35] <PKM4STER> @phantomsthirdeye apparently not all of them like the idea, but its getting there eventually.
[2023-01-06 11:04:39] <remokizz> :D
[2023-01-06 11:04:53] <DrivemanTV> Is it also possible to mod your games when playing on geforce now? For example skyrim is a game that is much better with mods
[2023-01-06 11:04:54] <%general_hotas> If GFN had Star Citizen I would immediate throw money at them
[2023-01-06 11:04:55] <Marcus1705> @NeoSatori Yes :)
[2023-01-06 11:04:58] <%+LamarrWilson> @Shivalla I just bought a very high end Samsung new tv and it has the app. I can use Luna on it too
[2023-01-06 11:05:14] <ElasmoFan> @phantomsthirdeye microsoft and playstation owning their own cloud service also makes it unrealistic any of their games and licenses would ever go to it
[2023-01-06 11:05:17] <Shivalla> @lamarrwilson Then your absolutely solid with it.
[2023-01-06 11:05:17] <PKM4STER> Lamarr be gaming on his new tv now NODDERS yay for GFN

[2023-01-06 11:05:33] <dzxbeast> @DrivemanTV i think its possible through steam workshop. burke mentioned something like that
[2023-01-06 11:05:33] <%+prfella> @general_hotas star citizen would have to be on steam, epic, ubisoft for it to wrk on GFN
[2023-01-06 11:05:34] <PKM4STER> @phantomsthirdeye greed and money?

[2023-01-06 11:24:59] <MEH_0> have you played dirt rally 2.0 without abs/steering assists ? aka proper simulation . with some turns and corrections needing less than a second to pull off you'd have to basically learn how to do everything early and predict how your car would behave and i don't mean just casual driving in dirt rally i mean actually trying to get best times on hardest difficulty
