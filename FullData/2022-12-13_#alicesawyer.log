[2022-12-13 21:49:59] <!%8lives> PS3 is great, except the sword boss is ESPECIALLY fucked up with it's controls and is almost impossible to beat the time attack for. It is doable, though

[2022-12-13 22:03:46] <esinahkalaukku> Then again its been a while so I should rewatch it
[2022-12-13 22:03:55] <!$YuyucatVT> Gremlins was supposed to be a LOT gorier
[2022-12-13 22:04:06] <+SkumoMcBee> To be fair most of the movies I've seen from there were on Netflix and other streaming sites that are AWFUL at horror movies
[2022-12-13 22:04:08] <esinahkalaukku> I was genuinely afraid of gremlins as a kid KEKW
[2022-12-13 22:04:31] <!$YuyucatVT> like Gremlins were supposed to have people half eaten by the gremlins and even the main character's mom's head roll down a step of stairs
[2022-12-13 22:04:39] <holdtounlock> would Festen count as a horror?
[2022-12-13 22:04:42] <LordXal> awful horror movies are fun to watch when high tbh KEKW
[2022-12-13 22:05:04] <esinahkalaukku> i thought The Ritual was pretty good tbh for a netflix film at least LUL

[2022-12-13 22:06:22] <Hirudolor> Imagine moving to Finland to cope with anything lmao
[2022-12-13 22:06:44] <supersanttu7> Let's just ignore Finnish horror and focus on the great Finnish video games; Sakarin Villapaitapeli.

[2022-12-13 22:14:05] <!%8lives> Quantum break is the Greatest argument for Forced diversity and games (and probably was used for one too) The whole plot relies on Seeing YOURSELF come back from the past, but the three main characters are all white guys with the same haircut and beard, so that part just ends up being confusing instead of significant
[2022-12-13 22:14:05] <+SkumoMcBee> Does Metroid Fusion count as sci-fi horror?
