[2022-12-29 04:13:04] <+ThatsNotMyPoo> Fail over only works in certain scenarios on most "near enterprise" routers.  There's a lot more involved to identify it's actually down.

[2022-12-29 04:13:32] <@%+FloofTech> @ThatsNotMyPoo The ASUS routers support failover by pinging to see if a signal is there. It worked on the old one.

[2022-12-29 04:13:37] <%richie00007> yep

[2022-12-29 04:14:49] <+Wychlight> It shouldn't be
[2022-12-29 04:14:57] <+Slow_Michelangelo> check to make sure your patch cable (modem to router) and your hard wire cables from router to PC are cat 6 not cat five if you have a internet speed over 200mb down.  it was an issue I found once at work. bought cat 6 cables, fixed.
[2022-12-29 04:15:04] <@%+FloofTech> @Elios000 He can't do active load balancing. the connections don't hold same speeds. it would cause him issues.
[2022-12-29 04:15:04] <%+Duvie> It would be a problem if you didn't do a forget on the networks and then add them back

[2022-12-29 04:15:20] <%Elios000> right but pro level one takes that in to account
[2022-12-29 04:15:20] <%richie00007> my wifi changes from day to day depending on usage I guess idknow.
[2022-12-29 04:15:21] <%+vackillers2013> could be a router firewall problem blocking everything
[2022-12-29 04:15:24] <EclecticSoundwaveSophist> I mean, Mrs marvel
[2022-12-29 04:15:28] <+DRWilliams3> probably said good luck with Asus routers
[2022-12-29 04:15:29] <%Elios000> but that kind stuff starts at like 800 bucks
[2022-12-29 04:15:30] <%gingytrucking> have you tried to unplug it and plug it back in burke D:
[2022-12-29 04:15:33] <%dyerdude_nz> could you host the internet with 2 networks?
[2022-12-29 04:15:33] <+ThatsNotMyPoo> Umm... Cat5 (or Cat5E, in most cases, same thing), is plenty fast for 1Gig, do NOT need Cat6 for that
[2022-12-29 04:15:47] <%+KapesZ> heard alot of issues with that router @FloofTech was thinking of getting it but now decided on getting Ubiquiti
[2022-12-29 04:15:48] <@%+FloofTech> @Elios000 He specifically wants a router with failover and wifi. I did offer wired enterprise solutions
[2022-12-29 04:15:53] <%+foosking0> CAT5e is 1 gig

[2022-12-29 04:16:17] <+ThatsNotMyPoo> I'd suggest just hiring a company to come in and configure/set it all up.  It's not that expensive

[2022-12-29 05:21:39] <%Varanid> I would like to have seen some of the ancient civilizations relics BEFORE tourism became the thing it is today. When countries acted normal and hadnt disfigured themselves for tourists
[2022-12-29 05:21:46] <+DRWilliams3> imagine how many minis he would have if he had a billion dollars
[2022-12-29 05:21:51] <%+D_Lion> I’m just at the betrayal in book two
[2022-12-29 05:21:54] <+BinaryFireball> you can use most of them but just research their lore after. like the world eaters turn to chaos and change their colors but it doesnt mean you can roll with white/blue
[2022-12-29 05:21:57] <%britedog> @CanHazBurritos  depends on interest i guess
[2022-12-29 05:22:12] <%britedog> lol
[2022-12-29 05:22:17] <%JebTRiX> I’m seriously nervous about a series.

[2022-12-29 05:22:38] <Frozen_Corpse> you sure 1 billion would be enough for a full army?
[2022-12-29 05:22:51] <%Varanid> the passionate fans of 40K are going to hold Henry Cavill to a high standard. I hope he exceeds it
[2022-12-29 05:22:59] <%MornielMoonlit> XD
[2022-12-29 05:23:05] <%+Maxheadspace> to who?

[2022-12-29 05:24:45] <$malogoss> @doctorpoopypantz peepoHey
[2022-12-29 05:24:48] <%+prfella> @varanid 40k adaptations are not known for their high quality, Cavill doesnt have to do too much, the bar is set low burkeKek
[2022-12-29 05:24:59] <+doctorpoopypantz> roleplaying the emperor sounds kinda boring. You just sit on the golden throne and don't do much besides eat psykers and keep the astronomicon lit
[2022-12-29 05:25:03] <%britedog> O.o
[2022-12-29 05:25:04] <%ManlyMutt> Eve!!! OMG I haven't played this in years
[2022-12-29 05:25:10] <%$GGuts> Btw I can highly recommend: The Infinite and The Divine (Warhammer 40000)
[2022-12-29 05:25:28] <%Varanid> @prfella thats why I hope he smashes the expectations - I want people like my non-nerd brother to ask me who TheEmperor really is
[2022-12-29 05:25:30] <+doctorpoopypantz> The golden throne which is breaking, btw
[2022-12-29 05:25:37] <%+BlueWhaleEVO> I actually just ordered the 40K recruit edition today. I’ve never played 40k or painted miniatures before but Burke has converted me. I love the 40k lore and wanna get more into it. Haha

[2022-12-29 05:47:59] <%DktrJ> depending on what type of wormhole it is, phyiscal things operate differently, like weapons have modifiers, engine modifiers etc
[2022-12-29 05:48:02] <Daniel_EU> @afromatic480 fun like every game. EVE is just unique and hard to understand for people who didn't allocated time to learn it

[2022-12-29 06:07:03] <%Varanid> Ricky and Chris - co-host and riff off of each other

[2022-12-29 06:07:13] <%DktrJ> I think it should be cohosted by Chris Rock and will Smith, they can do a couples skitch
[2022-12-29 06:07:13] <Ryter45> it would get ratings up
[2022-12-29 06:07:23] <VicVossVic> Chris Rock handled that situation like a pro
[2022-12-29 06:07:25] <%+WastingSanity> Chris Rock should get an Oscar for best person slapped at the Oscars while being a host.

[2022-12-29 07:04:12] <Traece> Guristas gimmick is having huge drone bonuses on their ships, and missile bonuses.

[2022-12-29 07:04:26] <Traece> But the cost of the drone bonuses is that they only field one or two drones max.

[2022-12-29 07:27:38] <%OldManMaple> @xJuanMoTacox def not true,  i played eve at launch, but didnt touch it again until 4 months ago,  I had nothing again,  but I have a fair amount of skills unlocked already

[2022-12-29 07:28:02] <%GuardianAngelz> @xJuanMoTacox EVE is very skill-based and not money based.
[2022-12-29 07:28:08] <ababyxox> I used to play wow
[2022-12-29 07:28:08] <Traece> As long as your aspiration for EVE isn't creating your own nullsec empire, the game should be pretty approachable across the board for a new player to get into.
[2022-12-29 07:28:17] <%+EbbanFloww> They also give you tons of stuff to start with now iirc
[2022-12-29 07:28:22] <%+zREDzLINEz2001> Asking questions is essential in the game, it's just finding the right person to ask questions to
[2022-12-29 07:28:35] <%DktrJ> plus you can throw money at it to make yourself even better - which I'll just say I'm not all together okay with but meh
[2022-12-29 07:28:41] <%OldManMaple> plus you can download the mobile app,  and queue up skills to keep levelling while yo'ure offline

[2022-12-29 07:31:14] <@%^The_Kraken_Bot>* Have a question? burkeHuh Check out our FAQ for your answer! https://burkeblack.tv/faq/
[2022-12-29 07:31:20] <+KickyMcFace> In Eve you NEVER fly what you can't afford to lose and replace by at least twice over. Even if it was a gank in a pirating-free zone there is no such thing as safe travel in Eve. Also, don't be silly and slap all your belongings in to a hauling ship and move it without help! Even if that help is something you have to pay for you need to transfer it in parts!
[2022-12-29 07:31:24] <%+AfroMatic480> WOOW!!!!!
[2022-12-29 07:31:25] <@%NoirMagic> cant even pay to win THAT much . yeah you can learn a lot of skills.. but the game also semi puinishes you at certai nthresholds and you get less skill points per injector at certain points
[2022-12-29 07:31:26] <%+AfroMatic480> LMFAOOOOO

[2022-12-29 07:33:46] <%xen_mind> I thought winning required teamwork in this game
[2022-12-29 07:33:52] <%GuardianAngelz> @BurkeBlack Whats up?
[2022-12-29 07:33:53] <+KickyMcFace> skills are great, but like a cake you don't buy it for the frosting. You bought a cake. (frosting being the skill points)
[2022-12-29 07:33:56] <Masterxblazter> @Mrfarside44 LOL
[2022-12-29 07:33:59] <Dankotron> so if you have two players of equal skill the one that has more money wins
[2022-12-29 07:34:03] <+Scrapped> @prkl8r Thats Pay to Progress which I'm fine with. I prefer to play the game and earn the credits but to each their own
[2022-12-29 07:34:07] <%DktrJ> Because you're currently running a massive debuff Burke. Once you remove that -99% competency debuff, you'll be massively p2winning

[2022-12-29 07:34:41] <+KickyMcFace> @Dankotron The one that has more friends wins... more money invested means more loss when killed. And they WILL die. There is no if.

[2022-12-29 08:03:59] <+eagleklawjlv> SOE in the lore was kinda like Search and rescue nuetral entities
[2022-12-29 08:04:00] <forrest_bug> scarry like alll the series i watched the last 3 months
[2022-12-29 08:04:08] <%+zREDzLINEz2001> EVE Online Factions are just like 40k Lore Factions, No faction in EVE is th egood guy
[2022-12-29 08:04:19] <%MornielMoonlit> @BurkeBlack so like "The Path to Hell is Paved with good Intentions" kinda thing?
[2022-12-29 08:04:28] <Demonius_Kracus> @burkeblack the SoE are kinda like the Red Cross but with thier own Navy
[2022-12-29 08:04:30] <+Godlypwng> 40k imperium is desperately trying to keep itself together at any cost
[2022-12-29 08:04:36] <Masterxblazter> So why is  it called 40 K ???

[2022-12-29 10:25:07] <jonnytiv> cycle its mwd
[2022-12-29 10:25:12] <Dundem> you need to select the fighters so that their outline turns blue instead of your carrier, then you need to use the same orbit / approach / warp commands you use for your own ships
[2022-12-29 10:25:35] <%qpan> sounds like the pilots name is burke
[2022-12-29 10:25:37] <%Twisted_Steel> Unlocking him would have worked there since you are still learning to control drones
[2022-12-29 10:25:44] <Deenoga> is burkes mic meant to be so quiet?
[2022-12-29 10:25:48] <Dundem> then if you want to steer your own carrier you need to select it by clicking the middle panel where you have all your shields n stuff so that its outline turns blue

[2022-12-29 10:57:58] <riskyjenkins> stream in this game get sniped
[2022-12-29 10:57:58] <Shivalla> blackops can open Cyno and basically drop supercarriers/capitals instantly to the cyno
[2022-12-29 10:58:01] <ProjectCNGG> You could if you're not worried about losing a few implants :)
[2022-12-29 10:58:03] <dark5pade> burke.. if you dont have any implants, you should grab a rookie ship and flay out there
[2022-12-29 10:58:09] <ProjectCNGG> if you have expensive ones, don't :D
[2022-12-29 10:58:10] <@%WillyWonka2197> You could've been one less person to do it

[2022-12-29 10:58:14] <@%xReadyAimMissx> @riskyjenkins that's just a shitty way to play a game.
[2022-12-29 10:58:16] <Dundem> I don't believe tehy were stream sniping. if theres 2 carriers roaming around hunting people in lowsec word gets around really fast

[2022-12-29 10:58:25] <@%WillyWonka2197> That doesn't make it okay to do it Sadge

[2022-12-29 10:58:37] <dark5pade> they dont care about stream sniping
[2022-12-29 10:58:40] <riskyjenkins> u shows info
[2022-12-29 10:58:41] <Shivalla> Doesn't care a bit.
[2022-12-29 10:58:44] <@%+dawneylee> yea it's just not a fun way to play a game sheesh
[2022-12-29 10:58:45] <Warrscythe> @dumhe did stream snipe. Hw said he did.
[2022-12-29 10:58:47] <+BaronBobBlitzkrieg> Yeah, CCP has a VERY hands-off approach on game moderation
[2022-12-29 10:58:48] <Cynthic> stream is a free intel channel for the enemies, CCP would just chuckle
[2022-12-29 10:58:48] <m2dam> its fun
[2022-12-29 10:59:02] <@%WillyWonka2197> It's fun to stream snipe PepeHands
[2022-12-29 10:59:09] <@%WillyWonka2197> Back in my day it was frowned upon

[2022-12-29 11:00:45] <Cynthic> @xen_mind which is why they have their own sandbox in the game to play in without players lol
[2022-12-29 11:00:50] <m2dam> yeah the gate name shows when warping to it
[2022-12-29 11:00:54] <riskyjenkins> lol
[2022-12-29 11:00:56] <riskyjenkins> figure it out
[2022-12-29 11:00:59] <t4basc0> no, you are not warping. Thats the point of the Devoter

[2022-12-29 11:01:18] <KotamaOlsaris> Supers can do like 22k dps
[2022-12-29 11:01:18] <%+Valarky> stream sniping in general is sad

[2022-12-29 11:01:25] <$SmilingCynic> @BurkeBlack You NEVER warp to the gate. You warp to nearby and slow burn to the gate

[2022-12-29 11:40:31] <cen1un10n> are you really playing eve if you are not flying an at ship though

[2022-12-29 11:41:17] <+Kagle_> best part of eve was flying multibillion T3 cruisers solo
[2022-12-29 11:41:24] <Deli_Ninja> i don't want to lose gear that i spent 2 months to get on a pvp game.
[2022-12-29 11:41:35] <+chobtt> exploring, doing ded sites
[2022-12-29 11:41:52] <%+Lewy9> you can easily scale how much isk you want to lose to something very cheap and lose it a lot
[2022-12-29 11:41:56] <$Maltidas> I cut my teeth on Ultima Online. I know how to lose it all. igaLol
[2022-12-29 11:41:58] <%+TigerLuv> he is really quiet
[2022-12-29 11:42:09] <$TunnelRatXIII> Then don't play games where you an lose stuff in PVP. They might be great games but the stress just is not worth it.
[2022-12-29 11:42:13] <Deli_Ninja> he sounds kinda like winnie the pooh
[2022-12-29 11:42:16] <@%+dawneylee> @xReadyAimMissx lol me too
[2022-12-29 11:42:21] <$TunnelRatXIII> And I say that having had to learn that lesson the hard way.
[2022-12-29 11:42:24] <Cynthic> People that fly ships they can't afford to replace are in the "i'm upset at this ship loss" category. Most corps run ship replacement programs, so if you lose something it gets replaced by the corp and not the in game personal isk wallet. Go and get blown up people, its fun!
[2022-12-29 11:42:36] <%Twisted_Steel> @Deli_Ninja Then why did you spend 2 months getting it then if you aren't willing to lose it, to spin in a station and look at how pretty it is?

[2022-12-29 11:43:04] <%Spidersfury> At this point of Twitch's existence, i find this whole conversation rather silly. 10 years it's been i think? Where people have been sniping etc, and whining over streamers doing what Burke is doing? Seems reeeealy dumb.
