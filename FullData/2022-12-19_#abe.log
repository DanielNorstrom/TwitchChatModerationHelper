[2022-12-19 02:03:07] <%DrTasslehoff> both stone and vault stone ores are the same tag now, so you have to adjust anything you changed to the vaultstone variant
[2022-12-19 02:03:11] <%DrTasslehoff> as that variant isn't used anymore
[2022-12-19 02:03:47] <%DrTasslehoff> Look at the name of vaultstone ore in your system, from before today
[2022-12-19 02:03:54] <KiiWiiiii> how would that work when you get into a mine or crystal room then ? would they still stack?

[2022-12-19 02:17:04] <PogaafThe2nd> I think people latch on to things like that because of captainsparklez as he always used to react as if it was targeted to him and gave the best reactions to it and as a viewer it was hilarious and people may think they will get the same from you
[2022-12-19 02:17:07] <midnight_hail> i think people genuinely forget that this is still in alpha, and you guys job its literally to find out things that need adjusting
[2022-12-19 02:17:07] <KiiWiiiii> balancing is often seen as nerfing

[2022-12-19 02:21:15] <Thegreat_dane> A lot of the changes happens in response on what he sees and what he wants the pack to progress I believe
[2022-12-19 02:21:15] <%sid_marie> You don't need tridents for the altar anymore
[2022-12-19 02:21:16] <whyu7x> just a lot of modded stuffs
[2022-12-19 02:21:16] <KiiWiiiii> It feels like he thinks his way ( and the devs way) is the only correct path and well it is his pack, so he is right, but still
[2022-12-19 02:21:19] <matikss321> unlock belts ? LUL

[2022-12-19 02:22:51] <matikss321> belts are gamechanging from my experience
[2022-12-19 02:22:53] <whyu7x> botania looks kinda useless
[2022-12-19 02:23:05] <KiiWiiiii> kinda deep i thhink
[2022-12-19 02:23:09] <%cole_ryan> you have to make the alf portal
[2022-12-19 02:23:10] <jimboslice94> for you a day
[2022-12-19 02:23:12] <%DrTasslehoff> Depends? There's a lot to the mod, but you don't actually need to do a lot with it
[2022-12-19 02:23:20] <%cole_ryan> its not
[2022-12-19 02:23:28] <%sid_marie> botany pots would be a great mod to learn. It's pretty much passive farming
[2022-12-19 02:23:45] <whyu7x> check the recipe, depends if you need terrasteel or elementium
[2022-12-19 02:23:47] <KiiWiiiii> 2 or 3 things were really nice from botania last seeason, now at least 1 of em is gone
[2022-12-19 02:23:49] <its_honk> I guess it depends on vault hunters changes to botania? Recipe wise?
[2022-12-19 02:23:50] <3boood67788> i have botania iam lvl 30 ez to open the portal
[2022-12-19 02:24:02] <3boood67788> just tons of laremar
[2022-12-19 02:24:16] <%cole_ryan> lol
[2022-12-19 02:24:24] <%DrTasslehoff> Botania is basically setup mana generator, with some automation, setup pure daisy/runic altar, setup terrasteel and you've got alfglass for flasks
[2022-12-19 02:24:25] <%+LaLaBriar> good thing he has tons of Larimar KEKW
[2022-12-19 02:24:25] <heeman_msi> woah
[2022-12-19 02:24:26] <%f0laaaaa> sold KEKW
[2022-12-19 02:24:38] VIEWERS: 596
[2022-12-19 02:24:40] <3boood67788> yes u would not have any problems
[2022-12-19 02:24:41] <KiiWiiiii> what does botania bring to the table this pack ? tera shatterer and health flasks ?
[2022-12-19 02:24:46] <%+LaLaBriar> is there a mod book?
[2022-12-19 02:24:47] <its_honk> "It uses tons of larimar" Abe: sold
[2022-12-19 02:24:55] <ValueTown> you don't have to open alfheim if you want botania potions but if you don't your potions will have less doses
[2022-12-19 02:25:04] <KiiWiiiii> not even tera shatterer ??
[2022-12-19 02:25:08] <3boood67788> the thing that double the red ston
[2022-12-19 02:25:18] <%DrTasslehoff> Loonium, orechid/orechid ignem, lots of the flowers and spreaders with lenses can do automation. Catalysts do work
[2022-12-19 02:25:29] <ValueTown> the 4 dose potions use mana glass and the 6 dose ones use alf glass
[2022-12-19 02:25:32] <+TaintedPhoenlx> maybe save for mekanism ?
[2022-12-19 02:25:35] <Bfreed10> can larimar be diffused?
[2022-12-19 02:25:36] <KiiWiiiii> potions seem to  be the only usefull things ??
[2022-12-19 02:25:39] <rebuffedpear071> Do they work in the vault though?
[2022-12-19 02:25:47] <KiiWiiiii> oh wait, 5/6
[2022-12-19 02:25:56] <+TaintedPhoenlx> @rebuffedpear071 they're not splash potions so probably?
[2022-12-19 02:26:02] <%Blibop> wait can you make regen potions?
[2022-12-19 02:26:10] <ValueTown> potions and the alchemy catalyst are the only things i can really think of. maybe some functional flowers
[2022-12-19 02:26:22] <KiiWiiiii> tera shatterer still in ??
[2022-12-19 02:26:26] <ValueTown> otherwise it's not worth the research cost imo
[2022-12-19 02:26:38] VIEWERS: 611
[2022-12-19 02:26:45] <+TaintedPhoenlx> whats the knowledge requirement for mekanism?
[2022-12-19 02:26:49] <%+LaLaBriar> its not that different from just being able to stack regular potions, right?
[2022-12-19 02:27:02] <+TaintedPhoenlx> are the charms still enabled or no
[2022-12-19 02:27:05] <%+LaLaBriar> so not op or game breaking
[2022-12-19 02:27:17] <KiiWiiiii> charms, no i believe

[2022-12-19 02:27:46] <Unknown17z> Can they even drink it if they dont have it unlocked?
[2022-12-19 02:27:57] <KiiWiiiii> for smp purposes, yes botania good mod.. for vaulting, not so much
[2022-12-19 02:28:26] <jaelj_> botania best, because you dont need power, maybe
[2022-12-19 02:28:31] <%+B1LB0_LAGG1NS> @taintedphoenlx they are disabled. iskall made their own version of charms/trinkets

[2022-12-19 02:28:39] <kriptou21> can you use botania flasks without having the mod? if yes you can open a shop for them
[2022-12-19 02:28:42] <ValueTown> i'm using create for mob farms and crop farm atm. it also generates hard to get blocks
[2022-12-19 02:28:45] <%sid_marie> mekanism and thermal expansion are the easier ones to understand imo
[2022-12-19 02:28:46] <KiiWiiiii> botania not worth the research
[2022-12-19 02:29:05] <%+LaLaBriar> KEKW
[2022-12-19 02:29:09] <%DrTasslehoff> I genuinely value having all four big mods, but botania is definitely higher on the list of ones
[2022-12-19 02:29:17] <%+LaLaBriar> NODDERS
[2022-12-19 02:29:36] <ValueTown> botania is the lowest on my list. it is not worth how much it costs. too much is disabled

[2022-12-19 02:31:23] <araab_mons> U can set any vault item in it
[2022-12-19 02:31:24] <KiiWiiiii> the options

[2022-12-19 02:31:26] <rohitjha941> filter by mods
[2022-12-19 02:31:29] <%DrTasslehoff> more filtering options, so you can rely less on memory settings
[2022-12-19 02:31:30] <%+B1LB0_LAGG1NS> you can set filter
[2022-12-19 02:31:35] <%+LaLaBriar> lets you filter by tags and nbt data
[2022-12-19 02:31:42] <chico9206> advanced can pickup by tag, that's what pete uses
[2022-12-19 02:31:55] <araab_mons> Like set by mod, u put one item that is found in the vault in it
[2022-12-19 02:31:59] <%+B1LB0_LAGG1NS> pete has one just to pick up vault items only
[2022-12-19 02:32:01] <araab_mons> And then all vault items go aytomativally
[2022-12-19 02:32:10] <araab_mons> You only have to set 1 item and all items go in
[2022-12-19 02:32:16] <+exarchsyne> Filter by mods so you dont need to memorize every single item
[2022-12-19 02:32:25] <matikss321> it is very easy abe

[2022-12-19 02:35:02] <%DrTasslehoff> it should retain stuff if it's the left-most bag in the recipe

[2022-12-19 02:39:22] <rohitjha941> You can have one bag for mod items, one for other, one for refrills

[2022-12-19 02:39:35] <+FyzzLive> You can make a second belt with the advanced pickup and just sort by vault mod so you don’t have to set up the memory

[2022-12-19 03:04:14] <zensway> there is also a priority to the backpacks based on where they are in your inventory, so if you want to have all annoying items from the vault mod picked up in a different pack you can auto pick up by mod, and just have the belt second in line

[2022-12-19 04:01:38] <h2oroy> If two player hit a different  last obelisk, will two bosses appear?
[2022-12-19 04:01:46] <glacor_ow> yeah current state of altar loot just makes me skip them
[2022-12-19 04:01:53] <glacor_ow> once favour gets reworked might be good then

[2022-12-19 04:02:02] <+Restlesguise> What FOV do you use?
[2022-12-19 04:02:23] <%DrTasslehoff> You really have to be hunting idols, echo, or favors to bother with altars currently. Nothing else actually drops
[2022-12-19 04:02:35] <carcmpr> Are the purple deals in gilded chests archetype things?
[2022-12-19 04:02:36] <glacor_ow> and idols are so much easier to craft
[2022-12-19 04:02:40] <glacor_ow> why bother to hunt them
[2022-12-19 04:02:56] <%DrTasslehoff> Only source of idols outside of crafting and treasure rooms though, so it should be good, just so rare
[2022-12-19 04:02:57] <carcmpr> I missed the patch notes from today

[2022-12-19 04:04:37] <h2oroy> Can you activate extra monoliths?
[2022-12-19 04:04:56] <KiiWiiiii> you know what would be nice, if you could click more monoliths/obs to increase crate loot
[2022-12-19 04:04:58] <MoistyGhost> did you have to name tag a snow golem so it wouldnt despawan or?

[2022-12-19 04:38:04] <carcmpr> 10% vault completion on average - per iskall...  "balanced"
[2022-12-19 04:38:45] <lindset8271> I would rather have some vaults not have an objective than have impossible ones
[2022-12-19 04:39:19] VIEWERS: 804
[2022-12-19 04:39:26] <lindset8271> Iskall said that
[2022-12-19 04:39:30] <%celinabena> they mean not all vaults are meant to be completable
[2022-12-19 04:39:31] <ValueTown> that's the completion rate iskall said he was aiming for, for early game
[2022-12-19 04:39:34] <carcmpr> In the beginning he was saying you should only complete 10% of vaults.
[2022-12-19 04:39:35] <faefair> he wants that
[2022-12-19 04:39:35] <%+Taticles> 10% is what Iskall is aiming for, what he envisions
[2022-12-19 04:39:38] <+KarinnaQ> no that is target
[2022-12-19 04:39:55] <+velociwolff> These new holiday vaults are so aesthetically pleasing… sooooo good
[2022-12-19 04:40:02] <Unknown17z> That was for early game
[2022-12-19 04:40:12] <MadLuter> that was early in season. dunno if he wants that rate for every level range
[2022-12-19 04:40:13] <%celinabena> I wish I knew the context for the buttons voice line
[2022-12-19 04:40:15] <carcmpr> I should clarify, completing the objective .
[2022-12-19 04:40:28] <exotonic07> that feels low especially because he expected the hunters to get lvl 10 on the first day
[2022-12-19 04:40:29] <MgnsMls> do snowman explode??
[2022-12-19 04:40:30] <+sierrawitchy> 10% for ealy game, and that goes up as you progress

[2022-12-19 05:00:47] <!%Neentarts> Then like more dye = more colours and other stuff can be added like gold nuggets etc
[2022-12-19 05:00:50] <hocky3649> The firework star right next to the firework
[2022-12-19 05:00:51] <dmain1971> Adding more gunpowder increases the duration of the rocket. Up to three gunpowder can be used. Up to five firework stars can also be used with three gunpowder. Up to seven firework stars can be used by using firework stars instead of additional gunpowder. All firework stars explode almost simultaneously when the rocket detonates.
[2022-12-19 05:00:59] <hocky3649> That is what is required
[2022-12-19 05:01:16] <%+LaLaBriar> gunpowder + up to 8 dye

[2022-12-19 05:01:33] VIEWERS: 774
[2022-12-19 05:01:36] <hocky3649> Then combine with rocket
[2022-12-19 05:01:44] <dmain1971> Up to eight dyes can be added. One head, gold nugget, feather, or fire charge can be added. Both the diamond and the glowstone dust can be added with any of the other ingredients.
[2022-12-19 05:01:46] <%pomodoko> combine with rocket
[2022-12-19 05:01:52] <+Fighrfly_> more gunpowder means it travels farther, more stars means it explodes more

[2022-12-19 05:58:44] <KiiWiiiii> wasnt this season mods focussed?

[2022-12-19 06:00:31] <Bfreed10> I think its in a great spot rn. The thing I dont get is the amount of larimar
[2022-12-19 06:00:41] <Bfreed10> Theres an insane amount
[2022-12-19 06:00:43] <%DrTasslehoff> ores have always bottlenecked until you run plentiful vaults. Those always drastically increase costs. Still, knowledge essence income has been a bit wild before today
[2022-12-19 06:00:45] <bigReverbX> he wanted you to be able to get some mods early but not just get all of them early
[2022-12-19 06:00:49] <KiiWiiiii> its only the big mods tho
[2022-12-19 06:00:53] <carcmpr> Well, they made the mod groups, so you don't increase the price of all mods when specializing in a certain group
[2022-12-19 06:01:03] <+carpeluna> He wanted the first mod in each category to be easier to get
[2022-12-19 06:01:15] <Bfreed10> Why is there such an abundance of larimar though

[2022-12-19 06:50:37] <immatureavocado> worth having levels up for altars?
[2022-12-19 06:50:38] <%samm35_> also, if you have an armour peice with a crap ton of durability like you're boots, u think it would be worth to put throns on?

[2022-12-19 06:55:35] <+ryayean> should you not be refunded the appropriate scaling dust?
[2022-12-19 06:55:41] <jewisaurusrex16> Is it cause of the progression speed
[2022-12-19 06:55:50] <Bfreed10> soooooo wont you be able to basically just craft those up again? im sure you have close to enough resources

[2022-12-19 07:04:18] <+anphibon> they should take idols away and just change the alter to light up when you do it. then make the effect of the favors worth it.
[2022-12-19 07:04:56] <Unknown17z> Idols are very flexible with modifiers though

[2022-12-19 07:22:35] <%the_khaliah> or immunity until some sort of input is done, moving, abilities, etc
[2022-12-19 07:23:07] <RockNGaming> The way the spawn protection mods I've seen work, are that you have damage immunity for several seconds, or until you move or press any keys.
[2022-12-19 07:23:35] <%celinabena> so they can either do nothing and keep it the way it is, or add relog invincibility and a dozen other things to make it not abusable Hmmge
[2022-12-19 07:23:42] <+anphibon> @the_khaliah i could abuse that in group vaults have you disconnect right next to the obelisk then reconnect and have someone else click the obelisk and you take aggro

[2022-12-19 07:24:32] <jaelj_> just add it and dont care about the cheese EZ
[2022-12-19 07:24:32] <RockNGaming> @anphibon That's why it would only last for a few seconds.
[2022-12-19 07:24:45] <untruthfully> i think the second u start moving it removes the invicibility
[2022-12-19 07:24:51] <untruthfully> that might be a decent idea
[2022-12-19 07:24:55] <itz_ray_ray> What about if you can’t do damage for 20 seconds after you log so that if you are going to do a boss it costs

[2022-12-19 07:26:50] <+HoYin1600p> open the boxes under the tree, each one has a chest in it
[2022-12-19 07:26:50] <RockNGaming> It could also be that you're in a ghostwalk-like mode until you click a confirmation button in the middle of the screen. And mobs don't target you, the vault timer doesn't move, you can't pick up items, etc. So it'd be like you weren't there until you confirm you're back in the game.

[2022-12-19 09:56:52] <GCxLife> @5th_Alice  I see, nice, to get the best out of it youll have to get high mana regen i tested it at 142, atleast a 100 damage, and it doesnt chain or cleave. so yeah a single hit max damage build plus high mana regen is our best bet to counter or overdo heal. also ramage till level 16 should be the best since then it goes to 8 mana/sec, which a super high loss of mana.

[2022-12-19 10:14:17] <GCxLife> thats 1/4 there
[2022-12-19 10:14:22] <phantomvander> its from less then 1/5 to more than 1/4

[2022-12-19 10:15:02] <itz_ray_ray> It’s honestly a great trade. I think is an upgrade tbh
[2022-12-19 10:15:05] <TheMorganWeedman> I think it’s worth
[2022-12-19 10:15:09] <phantomvander> so its like taking 20% ish less damage
[2022-12-19 10:15:09] <itz_ray_ray> Worth the health loss
[2022-12-19 10:15:15] <domain_18> yep

[2022-12-19 10:15:21] <%pushyb123> weakness cloud is bad imo, wouldn't it give strength to undead??

[2022-12-19 10:15:57] VIEWERS: 1 129
[2022-12-19 10:16:25] <PushEmYasser> honestly the defence stat does the math for you, theyre even, only diff is weakness vs healing
[2022-12-19 10:16:31] <PushEmYasser> and health
[2022-12-19 10:17:00] <YBNbossman> Depends how much you get hit
[2022-12-19 10:17:02] <TheMorganWeedman> Does weakness affect undead? I thought it was just health and damage pots that affect undead mobs differently
[2022-12-19 10:17:18] <Sir_Lanceylot> if the block chance procs it will block 100% of the hit instead of reducing the damage
[2022-12-19 10:17:28] <TheMorganWeedman> I think strength and weakness apply regularly unless I’m completely mistaken which I could very well be
