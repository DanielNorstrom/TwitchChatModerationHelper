[2023-01-02 14:10:36] <wakiuz> scavs this wipe has 2 modes, 1 they are stupid as hell and the other taps you in the head once
[2023-01-02 14:10:36] <huuski1> Scav's got always got em hot rounds
[2023-01-02 14:10:38] <+Neko_182> Locking PS rounds behind Prap 2 makes Scavs very spooky. Scavs are more lethal than PMC's now cause of ammo.

[2023-01-02 15:19:56] <noyanff> @Astropigey Standard or EOD

[2023-01-02 15:20:05] <zetr8> standart is pain
[2023-01-02 15:20:21] <+Spo_0n> @Astropigey Start with standard and if you like it you can upgrade versions later by paying the difference
[2023-01-02 15:20:21] <+RobotDoos> ODB eh?
[2023-01-02 15:20:32] <%Astropigey> why standard or EOD?
[2023-01-02 15:20:37] <noyanff> @zetr8 I am a standard user myself it is hard but still you can upgrade it afterwards
[2023-01-02 15:20:50] <Dim0n16> I shall now do something else while I leave your stream open in the backround. Gimme those sweet drops.

[2023-01-02 15:21:17] <%Astropigey> hmm
[2023-01-02 15:21:26] <%Astropigey> ogey
[2023-01-02 15:21:27] <noyanff> @Astropigey Standard is the lowest meanwhile EOD is the most expensive one. EOD makes game much more easier for you to play but there is a huge price gap between 2.
[2023-01-02 15:21:28] <zetr8> Standard is like 2x harder but ofc it's doable
[2023-01-02 15:21:34] <+Boone696> @Astropigey You should eventually buy EOD. Standard is to see if you'll enjoy the game, but EOD is worth the investment
[2023-01-02 15:21:42] <!%xHalFPSx> bigger streamers turned up
[2023-01-02 15:21:44] <!%xHalFPSx> cringe
[2023-01-02 15:21:48] <%Astropigey> ok thanks for the help
[2023-01-02 15:21:53] <noyanff> @Astropigey And you can always upgrade the game afterwards. So you can buy the Standard to see if you like the game first.
[2023-01-02 15:21:57] <!%xHalFPSx> XD
[2023-01-02 15:21:57] <%Astropigey> I'll do standard
[2023-01-02 15:22:03] <%Astropigey> o7

[2023-01-02 15:22:38] <FrizzleTits> standard is pain but your learning tarkov thats the game ROUGHT but if your like me and put 200-300 hours in two weeks
[2023-01-02 15:22:40] <BNBaku> speepy better give me some good drops
[2023-01-02 15:22:44] <FrizzleTits> then buy eod
[2023-01-02 15:22:46] <moshixyoshi> i would suggest for 1rst wipe you just buy standard learn the game than buy EOD when u know it
[2023-01-02 15:22:54] <%Oxide_EN> Counterpoint, standard might make you hate the game more with the tiny stash space and alpha container
[2023-01-02 15:22:56] <noyanff> I would buy standard and if you like it just save some money until EOD upgrade imo @Astropigey Or you would pay extra tax to the site everytime XD

[2023-01-02 15:23:26] <%Astropigey> @oxide_en I thought the Alpha containers were great?
[2023-01-02 15:23:41] <noyanff> Other than that I agree with you.

[2023-01-02 17:31:27] <+Twismyer> Idk I always thought, for some reason, that due to its gameplay and depth of ammo mechanics, that Tarkov was much more niche than it actually is I guess.
[2023-01-02 17:31:47] <%+タカミツ (takamitu__)> I love goemon stream. I still watching  lol
[2023-01-02 17:31:56] <Nyrthar> yea and the extracts are just oppossite corners of the map

[2023-01-02 18:04:27] <!$ZetthaVT> no wonder you get absolutely swarmed as pmc
[2023-01-02 18:04:35] <+Siegfried29> you actually fight pmcs a lot when you spawn early though

[2023-01-02 18:05:42] <+Mathinator01> I dislike spawning early as a scav, mainly because I don't really fight pmcs, so those guys already being gone is good for me

[2023-01-02 19:21:55] <BurningSaph> Yeah
[2023-01-02 19:21:56] <%Reisen____> yeah fandom is dogshit
[2023-01-02 19:22:16] <%Rappolt> Fandom features are bad, but the management is worse lol
[2023-01-02 19:22:22] <nissanpeek> i mean atleast its there even tho its not acurate it still helps people somehow ^^
[2023-01-02 19:22:34] <%Reisen____> Path of exile specifically had to have fans make their own wiki cuz the fandom was griefed and outdated af
[2023-01-02 19:22:41] <Foven1> jesus christ
[2023-01-02 19:22:43] <nissanpeek> true tho
[2023-01-02 19:22:53] <Foven1> wikis may be helpful but these big centralised ones were a mistake
[2023-01-02 19:23:13] <+blenderin0> was fandom also the site that embeds/viewbots fextralife?
[2023-01-02 19:23:21] <%Mriggyoggy> ohhhhhh drama
[2023-01-02 19:23:22] <%Rappolt> This makes me wanna host a wiki that the dataminers can use, but I know that won't even fix the misinfo in the game lol
[2023-01-02 19:23:23] <%baz_exe> henlo Sleepy
[2023-01-02 19:23:29] <Solethia> Wikipedia is alright. Run by a foundation though. So not a company.

[2023-01-02 19:24:27] <%Rappolt> Having the embedded stream gives him a huge number boost. NoFood gets similar from the ammo chart

[2023-01-02 19:24:56] <%Rappolt> The difference is you can ask NoFood about the info on the website, unlike Fandom and fextra

[2023-01-02 20:34:23] <+Gebraheel> @Gebraheel It might be something like that. The last time BSG messed with Scav hit-reg it was because there was a problem with scav's aiming for the body and bullet drop made it seem like they'd programmed in a leg-meta.  If they adjusted bullet-drop or scav aim again, I could see that being the problem.
[2023-01-02 20:34:23] <%JayBusch> Oh, nice! I just was able to open my Analog Pocket, and found my Oracle of Seasons cart to play. But I'm looking at getting a few games moved to a microSD card for easy play.

[2023-01-02 21:03:04] <+Gebraheel> Caffeine works by increasing the circulation of chemicals like Cortisol and Adrenaline in your body. It doesn't release sugar or anything. That Cortisol release, also known as the stress hormone, is why caffeine works as a stimulant for most, and acts as a substitute for ADHD meds on unmedicated individuals with ADHD.\

[2023-01-02 21:10:11] <%Rappolt> unless they brought back the bug where Santa shoots you if you shot a scav
[2023-01-02 21:10:12] <kylianjdv> is there an issue with matchmaking?

[2023-01-02 21:11:10] <Bambi_S> @Bambi_S With anything like poppy seeds you need to prove that you aren't on other drugs. With prescribed medication, the health dept will tell them that this person should be positive.

[2023-01-02 23:38:02] <%Rappolt> BUT it is a good mentality to not always want to "optimize" loot. Yeah, you can find more, but it's a risk. It's a decision... one I often choose greed for skulle22Hoho
