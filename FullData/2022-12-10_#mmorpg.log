[2022-12-10 14:05:44] <Haukanne> Ive heard there was again item/gold duping going which caused the rollback?
[2022-12-10 14:05:50] <@%Doctor_Love> I wish there was a site with the lore from all the quests so we could read it like a story.
[2022-12-10 14:05:55] <sssamTV> where'd you hear that lol
[2022-12-10 14:06:10] <@%Doctor_Love> I skip over so much verbiage in the game to get finished with stuff faster
[2022-12-10 14:06:25] <@%Doctor_Love> Be interesting to actually read it in book form
[2022-12-10 14:06:26] <sssamTV> Servers were being dodgy for a good couple hours before they went offline.
[2022-12-10 14:06:37] <Rsltdude> @doctor_love i wish there was a movie from the quest with the whiole lore

[2022-12-10 14:07:29] <Rsltdude> @doctor_love true
[2022-12-10 14:07:39] <sssamTV> On twitter they said the rollback is going to be to just before the servers started having problems. Cant remember exactly what time that was
[2022-12-10 14:07:46] <@%Doctor_Love> Which quest would be the best movie? I‚Äôd love to see desert treasure animated movie

[2022-12-10 14:07:53] <Rsltdude> @doctor_love maybe it will be after 9 years like arcane did
[2022-12-10 14:08:00] <sssamTV> A kingdom divided would make a good movie.

[2022-12-10 15:09:56] <+slaywolfosrs> @eyvind33 crashes offer inequities and opportunities for exploits, or for example, a hcim in TOB would be dc'd and auto lumby'd. A rollback avoids such potential.
[2022-12-10 15:10:03] <Mako_NS> there better be some free game time or something for all this down time
