[2022-12-23 09:18:50] <%SlavioAraragi> wasn't that already a thing? elaHmm
[2022-12-23 09:19:10] <%Quifenadine> apperantly she did like a debut in 2018 or something and now back up
[2022-12-23 09:19:44] <%SlavioAraragi> but she says she was created one year ago LUL
[2022-12-23 09:20:02] <%SlavioAraragi> so basically
[2022-12-23 09:20:10] <%Quifenadine> ai self conscious about being stinky
[2022-12-23 09:20:50] <%SlavioAraragi> some dood is playing a game, stream it, and then animated an avatar and wrote an AI engine that responds to chat and implemented text-to-speech for it LUL
[2022-12-23 09:20:56] <%Quifenadine> no
[2022-12-23 09:21:02] <%Quifenadine> its an AI playing the game too

[2022-12-23 09:22:12] <%Quifenadine> overtime
[2022-12-23 09:22:19] <%Quifenadine> tech is cool in my opinion and also funny
[2022-12-23 09:22:20] <%SlavioAraragi> AI can "learn" on the basis of it's interaction
[2022-12-23 09:22:30] <%SlavioAraragi> like the test AI on twitter Microsoft published once
[2022-12-23 09:22:39] <%Quifenadine> NODDERS
[2022-12-23 09:22:47] <%SlavioAraragi> all the AI engines/generators are "learning"
[2022-12-23 09:23:00] <%Quifenadine> just usually most people just let it train for like 5 million generations and then let it go
[2022-12-23 09:23:08] <%SlavioAraragi> but I think those like this streaming here and the microsoft one are on a higher level of learning
[2022-12-23 09:23:14] <%Quifenadine> but here its probably like a few hundred generations a day or something
[2022-12-23 09:23:33] <%SlavioAraragi> I mean it is pretty dope to see
[2022-12-23 09:23:38] <%SlavioAraragi> soon we won't have Elajjaz

[2022-12-23 12:30:34] <%Xaimou> the mainline is sooo dark, dank, depressing
[2022-12-23 12:30:38] <%Xaimou> pepeLost
[2022-12-23 12:30:41] <%iSilent_> you're more likely to listen to a song first before playing the game

[2022-12-23 12:34:41] <%Grom_mash> should i play 5 chat
[2022-12-23 12:34:44] <%iSilent_> its my opinion from looking at gameplay a bit not actually playing
[2022-12-23 12:34:44] <%Xaimou> i tihnk its the color

[2022-12-23 12:36:24] <%SlavioAraragi> I mean of course 4 is outdated when compared to 5 LUL but 5 has a totally different art design in comparison to previous games

[2022-12-23 12:37:23] <%Xaimou> @SlavioAraragi prolly the reason why people who started 5 might not like the style on the previous games
[2022-12-23 12:37:25] <%Xaimou> no idea
[2022-12-23 12:37:27] <%Xaimou> i'm not picky
[2022-12-23 12:37:35] <%SlavioAraragi> that is true
[2022-12-23 12:37:58] <%SlavioAraragi> that's the only good thing about using P3P for PC port, Portable has "full command" option for party members KEKW
[2022-12-23 12:37:58] <%Xaimou> and when you walk and talk to people in p5
[2022-12-23 12:38:00] <%Xaimou> feels great
[2022-12-23 12:38:04] <%SlavioAraragi> original P3 only had action profiles KEKW
[2022-12-23 12:38:10] <%Xaimou> LULW

[2022-12-23 12:40:16] <%SlavioAraragi> I love the dark-ish theme of Persona 3. I kinda prefer it over Persona 4. But it's just a matter of different vibe. I'd probably appreciate 4 more for what it was doing if I didn't play it right after finishing 3
[2022-12-23 12:40:51] <%super_spyro> P4 was kinda dark too monkASS

[2022-12-23 12:41:41] <%Xaimou> p4 is a bit too bright of a setting but it do gets darker at some point
[2022-12-23 12:41:44] <%Xaimou> but p3 is definitely darker

[2022-12-23 14:41:46] <%iSilent_> the ones that voice their hate are usually the loudest
[2022-12-23 14:41:48] <%Quifenadine> DOTA OMEGALUL
[2022-12-23 14:42:06] <%iSilent_> its why you're most likely to find an article about something being bad than something being good
[2022-12-23 14:42:07] <%SlavioAraragi> I tried learning Dota once PepeLaugh long story short I do not play team based pvp games anymore PepeLaugh

[2022-12-23 14:42:30] <%Xaimou> i played dota first then league
[2022-12-23 14:42:39] <%Xaimou> i actually enjoyed league because of its simplicity

[2022-12-23 14:42:56] <%SlavioAraragi> a friend hooked us all in
[2022-12-23 14:43:00] <%Xaimou> what i experience is league is more champion skill based than dota
[2022-12-23 14:43:09] <%SlavioAraragi> I still remember all the memes DOTA2 vs LoL
[2022-12-23 14:43:11] <%SlavioAraragi> and that one game
[2022-12-23 14:43:27] <%iSilent_> Heroes of the Storm?
[2022-12-23 14:43:40] <%SlavioAraragi> with enemy Shaco in the jungle. Dude made stats like 50/2 monkaW and then at the end wrote "This is too easy I'm getting back to DOTA" KEKW
[2022-12-23 14:43:48] <%Xaimou> in league you can win even if you're bad at macros but if you're really good with a specific champion
[2022-12-23 14:43:53] <%Xaimou> you're potentially gonna carry them

[2022-12-23 15:00:05] <%Xaimou> @iSilent_ definitely man
[2022-12-23 15:00:11] <%Xaimou> forced to playing a character you don't main
[2022-12-23 15:00:14] <%Xaimou> against a hard boss
[2022-12-23 15:00:15] <%Xaimou> is pain
[2022-12-23 15:00:42] <%Xaimou> luckily i played a lot of mishimas back in tekken tag-5 LULW
[2022-12-23 15:01:15] <%Xaimou> i only did old school combos with no screws
[2022-12-23 15:01:16] <%Xaimou> LULW
[2022-12-23 15:01:19] <%iSilent_> tag was always WAYTOODANK for me
[2022-12-23 15:01:50] <%Xaimou> its actually not as hard as you think
[2022-12-23 15:01:57] <%Xaimou> but if its your first tekken game
[2022-12-23 15:02:01] <%Xaimou> it could be overwhelming
[2022-12-23 15:02:36] <%iSilent_> i used to play 4 with my friend on his ps2
[2022-12-23 15:02:44] <%Xaimou> i just want Giga monkASS on T8
[2022-12-23 15:02:46] <%iSilent_> he'd smash me every time
[2022-12-23 15:02:51] <%Xaimou> he's my main on T7
[2022-12-23 15:03:18] <%iSilent_> was it 4 actually
[2022-12-23 15:03:22] <%iSilent_> let me google
[2022-12-23 15:03:25] <%Xaimou> 4Shrug
[2022-12-23 15:03:43] <%Xaimou> if it has less characters than the usual
[2022-12-23 15:03:48] <%Xaimou> it mustve been 4
[2022-12-23 15:03:57] <%Xaimou> and with the cool stages and everything
[2022-12-23 15:04:22] <%SlavioAraragi> I remember playing Tekken 5, couldn't kill the last boss PepeLaugh only managed once with Xiaoyu PepeLaugh after that I didn't touch fighting games for ages KEKW until the release of DBFZ LUL
[2022-12-23 15:04:30] <%iSilent_> oh i confused them
[2022-12-23 15:04:33] <%Xaimou> but in terms of gameplay T4 is the most broken PepeLaugh
[2022-12-23 15:04:37] <%iSilent_> its tag and tekken 4
[2022-12-23 15:04:49] <%Xaimou> @SlavioAraragi no way LULW
[2022-12-23 15:05:01] <%Xaimou> at least you've beaten jinpachi NODDERS
[2022-12-23 15:05:18] <%Xaimou> i'm pretty sure if you practiced just a little bit
[2022-12-23 15:05:23] <%SlavioAraragi> now I'm a huge fan of them NODDERS love Tekken NODDERS like SF NODDERS tried all kinds of other titles NODDERS

[2022-12-23 15:45:56] <%gadrus> ToxicBurrito I tried it but it feels like a ps3 game sometimes LULW with the small zones etc also insane global cooldown FeelsMan
[2022-12-23 15:46:13] <%TheMoltenGuy> that's because it is a ps3 game
[2022-12-23 15:46:24] <%Pandushe> isnt it just small zones at the starting zones? cuz of tech limitations at the time
[2022-12-23 15:46:27] <%+Moepsiii> people came home from work, wanted to play for 2-5 hours and the que was 6 hours LULW
[2022-12-23 15:46:28] <%gadrus> guess i was feeling correctly OMEGALUL
[2022-12-23 15:46:32] <%haaTzz> why ela banner says he has 13 y old xd
[2022-12-23 15:46:37] <%haaTzz> hes *
[2022-12-23 15:46:47] <%TheMoltenGuy> yeah the zones in ARR are small because of PS3 limitations
[2022-12-23 15:46:49] <%+Moepsiii> because if he says he is 12 he would get banned
[2022-12-23 15:46:51] <%Dijaxtra> do u think ela is drawing glasses on his face right now? COPIUM

[2022-12-23 15:49:21] <%TheMoltenGuy> the game needs a solo queue *badly*
