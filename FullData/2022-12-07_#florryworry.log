[2022-12-07 17:58:42] <Regimon69> ah okay
[2022-12-07 17:58:49] <@%DonPedry> admin efficiency from tech was added in 1.6, but it affected only very few things - like warscore and AE only or something
[2022-12-07 17:59:00] <smokeweedz> 1.4.1? why not 1.0?
[2022-12-07 17:59:13] <@%DonPedry> @smokeweedz 1.4.1 is the oldest legally available version
[2022-12-07 17:59:14] <@%DoctorJamesRustles> wait admin efficiency didn't used to reduce core cost?

[2022-12-07 18:00:31] <ArchiV33> i dont understand, the odlest version ican acces through steam is 1.27.2... 1.4.1 came aftor, no ? so it isnt the oldest patch ?

[2022-12-07 18:01:08] <AlienFC91> @ArchiV33 you need to get a code from PDX forums to get older patches to show up in steam
[2022-12-07 18:01:08] <devek1002> @ArchiV33 You need to get the password from PDX's website, they had to make pre-1.27 versions hidden by default because of GDPR
[2022-12-07 18:01:10] <%DarkFV> @ArchiV33 im no genius, but pretty sure 27 is bigger than 4 KEKW
[2022-12-07 18:01:12] <@%DonPedry> @devek1002 the oldest version available on steam is 1.4.1 - if you manage to convince PDX to share 1.0.0 then it will be legal :)
