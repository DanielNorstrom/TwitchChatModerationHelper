[2023-01-04 18:36:46] <%iamSamm_> Do you ever re-roll skin shards? Or do you just disenchant or collect them?

[2023-01-04 18:40:01] <+mizar_and_alcor> if you own a champ, it automatically unlocks
[2023-01-04 18:40:04] <%Tambooob> I think it unlocked? Hmmmm
[2023-01-04 18:40:06] <%iamSamm_> Did it go directly to your skins?
[2023-01-04 18:41:13] <%+SeraphButterfly> Skins based on the winner of the Worlds tournament.
[2023-01-04 18:41:19] <%iamSamm_> I think that's a World's skin
[2023-01-04 18:41:20] <@%nmussa> Looks like a gender bent Raze peepoGiggles

[2023-01-04 18:42:16] <%+SeraphButterfly> Uh only during the Halloween season I believe
[2023-01-04 18:42:37] <%+SeraphButterfly> They rerun them every year, but they tend to retire the really old skins so the only way to get them is through skin shards. Don't quote me on that though.
[2023-01-04 18:42:48] <%$moeiscrazy> Riot tends to bring stuff back though
[2023-01-04 18:43:16] <@%nmussa> Just one more COPIUM

[2023-01-04 18:43:32] <%+SeraphButterfly> They're just like.. champion-based challenges or something.
[2023-01-04 18:43:38] <@%nmussa> You play 3 characters to be fair
[2023-01-04 18:43:43] <@%nmussa> The odds aren't really in your favor peepoGiggles
[2023-01-04 18:43:45] <%daguava> when you only play two champions that's a bit hard
[2023-01-04 18:43:46] <%+SeraphButterfly> KEKW great emote
[2023-01-04 18:44:15] <%$moeiscrazy> diversify your league portfolio
