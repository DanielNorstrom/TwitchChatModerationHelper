[2023-01-03 15:46:50] <zanthren> Hi pohx! Been out of the PoE loop due to the holidays, but excited to get back in it. Did your holidays go well, if you celebrate?
[2023-01-03 15:47:50] <%tiny_pickle_packer> I beat 80 quant feared with this build, this has been the best league of all time :)
[2023-01-03 15:48:25] <Mauresques> Hello there, just switched to explose with JUST the flask (perfectly rolled). It works very well with 100% ignite chance and prolif on gloves but I was wondering : Is there ANY way to add herald of ash without removing Malevolence or Skitterbots ?
[2023-01-03 15:48:31] VIEWERS: 958
[2023-01-03 15:48:37] <DarkKwiskas> How much ‘reduced recovery’ can you usually survive ? 40% is still okay for me, but 60 is bad.
[2023-01-03 15:48:43] <DarkKwiskas> I am not

[2023-01-03 15:51:05] <renonium_> Hi, Pohx. whats your verdict on RF for sanctum, I am terribly struglling.
[2023-01-03 15:51:38] <Mauresques> I'm really NOT struggling tbh after you get some decent relics... I'm just zooming through the whole content without even looking at rooms
[2023-01-03 15:52:27] <Mauresques> RF is more than fine, most people are struggling on the harder version of the boss because resolve doesn't tank for them anymore, I just facetank the maze and the beam haha
[2023-01-03 15:52:33] VIEWERS: 61
[2023-01-03 15:52:44] <renonium_> Thanks! whats lover level? like in low t maps
[2023-01-03 15:53:10] <@%lemoncoolers> I have yet to complete a single sanctum. Idk I just suck at it. Never even made it to the third floor
[2023-01-03 15:53:11] <OMFGaTaco> does 2nd phase of final boss use the resolve stuff or is it a normal fight?
[2023-01-03 15:53:24] <OMFGaTaco> ive never done it because i thought it used resolve
[2023-01-03 15:53:38] <Desmaner> accept the fact, its not the build its the player in sanctum
[2023-01-03 15:53:52] <%Ackgroun> Hey Phox, just wanted to say a quick sincere thanks for all your guidance, this is the first time since 3.11 I've completed the atlas and even levelled gems to 20 before shelving a build, having a blast so far.
[2023-01-03 15:53:53] <Mauresques> lemoncoolers : If you get a relic (fairly common) wich has the "Gain Inspiration when you receive an affliction" it's freewin
[2023-01-03 15:54:08] <@%lemoncoolers> @Mauresques Had that. Still couldn't win.
[2023-01-03 15:54:10] <Desmaner> and I have to say I have not completed sanctum
[2023-01-03 15:54:23] <OMFGaTaco> its pretty comfy, honestly
[2023-01-03 15:54:25] <OMFGaTaco> just need to know how to not eat hits
[2023-01-03 15:54:32] <%+ero_manga_sensei_> just dont get hit LUL
[2023-01-03 15:54:33] VIEWERS: 120
[2023-01-03 15:54:39] <Desmaner> hits are delicious
[2023-01-03 15:54:41] <kurogane1979> so you can store sanctum rooms on red tier and run all on white ?
[2023-01-03 15:55:01] <@%lemoncoolers> I have no idea. I just lose resolve without ever knowing how.
[2023-01-03 15:55:11] <%tiny_pickle_packer> I took double guards for the first time so some rooms are wild KEKW
[2023-01-03 15:55:13] <@%lemoncoolers> I always think I'm dodging but somehow get hit
[2023-01-03 15:55:27] <renonium_> yea double beams

[2023-01-03 15:58:43] <@%GoGoLoThirty> Ty ty, yep pretty lucky, only 500k kills and I got 12 divs :D
[2023-01-03 15:58:53] <%Antiswipe> Dope
[2023-01-03 15:58:56] <OMFGaTaco> anything specific you should do for Legions? feels a bit eh there and im trying to farm a lethal pride for another build
[2023-01-03 15:59:00] <renonium_> yea apart from legion and sanctum for me RF supper smooth right now
[2023-01-03 15:59:04] <OMFGaTaco> i assume more fire trap focus
[2023-01-03 15:59:09] <%Strollein> Im at 1,5m kills and only found 1 div shrine
[2023-01-03 15:59:14] <%Strollein> then again 500k were like red altars
[2023-01-03 15:59:22] <@%GoGoLoThirty> There is a node for legion rares to take more dmg
[2023-01-03 15:59:25] <@%GoGoLoThirty> And also AOE when they break out
[2023-01-03 15:59:37] <@%GoGoLoThirty> On atlas that is

[2023-01-03 16:00:42] <@%GoGoLoThirty> And probably avoid the one that gives them more hp per reward. It’s juicy but you’ll probably get more value without it since we aren’t crit and ranged
[2023-01-03 16:00:53] <skinnamarinkydinkydink> looking good today pohx

[2023-01-03 16:03:04] <@%GoGoLoThirty> In red maps chaos 0 will kill you
[2023-01-03 16:03:32] <%Antiswipe> Yeah, I've got 25% pre-buff (without flask)
[2023-01-03 16:03:37] <@%GoGoLoThirty> It’s not trivial, but this build is totally capable of capped chaos

[2023-01-03 16:14:20] <ElectricFlex> I'm running Brass Dome right now, you're hilariously tanky with it
[2023-01-03 16:14:28] <Bizz_Boyz> so it might be better to craft a rare ?

[2023-01-03 16:14:47] <@%donavanshepard> i like rare crafted more than brass dome
[2023-01-03 16:14:53] <@%donavanshepard> But I also think crafting is fun in this game
[2023-01-03 16:15:04] <%Antiswipe> @ElectricFlex With your brass dome, are you running purity of elements?
[2023-01-03 16:15:04] <Bizz_Boyz> okay thanks 🙂
[2023-01-03 16:15:49] <%+bretac78> 89 max fire res with a Brass Dome feels great for not dying
[2023-01-03 16:15:51] <%+guested> I used to get popped now and then by expedition mobs but that stopped completely once I moved to Brass Dome stopping me from their big crits
[2023-01-03 16:16:07] <Bizz_Boyz> its just that i have had a great time in delve and now i got 20 div so i kinda wanner make some upgrades 🙂
[2023-01-03 16:16:10] <%Antiswipe> How do you keep up your res with brass dome?
[2023-01-03 16:16:10] <@%lemoncoolers> @guested it's likely not big crits either you were picking overwhelm physical or added chaos dmg
[2023-01-03 16:16:20] <ElectricFlex> @ElectricFlex think I was when I first switched, but now most of my res is coming from rings
[2023-01-03 16:16:22] <@%lemoncoolers> @Antiswipe gear
[2023-01-03 16:16:24] <%+guested> No, I was very careful not to pick those

If I had to make one critic about the content is : I'm missing some "advanced" stuff for min/maxing but at this point I considere it's my fault : I should know what I'm doing at this point if I want to go further with the build
[2023-01-03 16:16:46] <@%lemoncoolers> well then it'd be armor not critsd

[2023-01-03 16:46:03] <@%lemoncoolers> @GoGoLoThirty for not streaming for over a year and getting that good of viewership I'd say that is actually a good example of getting grandfathered in
[2023-01-03 16:46:22] <@%GoGoLoThirty> @GoGoLoThirty right I guess thats true. also didnt realize he only stopped a year ago, thought it was much longer
[2023-01-03 16:46:28] <+BrindleBeard> does increased spell damage work towards rf? feels like a dumb question tbh

[2023-01-03 16:51:01] <NoFailer> It is not a bug
[2023-01-03 16:51:03] <SmurfUnunoctium> you can use vixens OR cursed ground with spell cascade to instaproc it so you can level from 31 with it
[2023-01-03 16:51:10] <@%donavanshepard> 30% ele, @renonium_

[2023-01-03 17:23:39] <+JonnyXM> is RF good with the need league mechanics
[2023-01-03 17:23:49] <%+Sadisticmgt> That's because some people are taking 5-10 mins to clear red maps, when they could be clearing white maps in 2 mins a piece.
[2023-01-03 17:24:00] <+orca848> will u go explode rf this league ?
[2023-01-03 17:24:07] <@%GoGoLoThirty> well a lot of times its how ppl play too. plenty of ppl have no idea what havoc looks like when he is chaining maps. they are doing like 5 maps an hour sometimes. that was me when i first started too
[2023-01-03 17:24:07] <jukeMcFadden> @JonnyXM you need a lot of damage that it kinda feels okay. if you lack dmg it will feel horrible

[2023-01-03 17:27:02] <jukeMcFadden> most definitely. when I got early into redmaps which was fine with lacking gear, the sanctum was almost impossible for me. learning the mechanics was still mandatory though even with better gear for me LuL
[2023-01-03 17:27:34] <%+Sadisticmgt> Makes sense, I guess I'm just impatient. Thanks for the insight.

[2023-01-03 17:47:52] <+antonhavree> I enjoy the concept of SSF,but i just hate grinding for crafting bases and target farm for items to use for crafting... So standard to buy bases and convert currency to mats i need to craft everything myself is how i do it... Good compromise imo

[2023-01-03 17:55:39] <@%GoGoLoThirty> i mean i made a variant with reap exsang. looked okay in PoB at least. never got deep with it ingame
[2023-01-03 17:55:48] <@%GoGoLoThirty> jugg is an amazing template to work off of
[2023-01-03 17:55:54] <%smuthole> old poe beta boomer here, loving the POB soon 98 :>
[2023-01-03 17:55:59] <@%GoGoLoThirty> and pohx has nailed the defensive archetype for spell juggs
[2023-01-03 17:56:15] <@%GoGoLoThirty> or like left side tree juggs i guess
[2023-01-03 17:56:17] <@%lemoncoolers> EA jugg is good too
[2023-01-03 17:56:28] <@%GoGoLoThirty> yeee lots of ppl playing that in HC ive seen on ninja
[2023-01-03 17:56:29] <+ddaaveee> I know what I'm doing today, rerolling RF jugg. I suck at the league mechanic anyways, so i'm not missing out on much
[2023-01-03 17:56:31] <+fallenkingdompsn> ok, I checked poxh website for flasks to use with mageblood, but I didn't see. what would you recommend? thanks, I'm sure you've been asked this

[2023-01-03 17:57:30] <@%lemoncoolers> @fallenkingdompsn you don't just equip mageblood and equip flasks and go. You want to fully build your character around it to utilize mageblood to the fullest.
[2023-01-03 17:57:30] <+fallenkingdompsn> thats what I was using and added a sulphur flask

[2023-01-03 17:58:16] <+ddaaveee> @fallenkingdompsn mageblood is a great item. It just sucks figuring out how to make it effective. I got one two leagues ago and it bricked my want to play the game
[2023-01-03 17:58:16] <@%lemoncoolers> ok well that doesn't mean you understand how to utilize mageblood lol

[2023-01-03 18:27:55] <+antonhavree> Isn't it generally people with ADD or ADHD tend to have kind of the opposite effect from caffeine?
[2023-01-03 18:28:01] <simplygrass> coffee adderal
[2023-01-03 18:28:59] <@%GoGoLoThirty> @antonhavree well stimulants will allow ADHD people to focus, as a general statement anyway, but you dont have to have ADHD to gain improved mental acuity and improved mood after using stimulants

[2023-01-03 18:50:47] <@%lemoncoolers> Record labels don't make money from people not paying for the music. You may think they benefit from the exposure, but they don't.

[2023-01-03 18:51:08] <@%GoGoLoThirty> right but its collateral damage from music streams, mixes on youtube, etc etc. its targeting consumption not advertising.

[2023-01-03 18:52:59] <@%GoGoLoThirty> well the harm is not you promoting. the laws are there to stop people from broadcasting, distributing, etc, copyrighted material. you are on a platform that can easily be used to illicitly broadcast copyrighted media.
[2023-01-03 18:52:59] <@%lemoncoolers> They run the numbers. It doesn't increase revenue to any significant degree.
[2023-01-03 18:53:01] <+adampod> broadcasting rights i guess
[2023-01-03 18:53:03] <MrShakurr> but what is the downside of letting streamers play it though if they aren't listening to it illegally

[2023-01-03 18:53:25] <2Mits> it's probably a sideffect of an automated system that suited them
[2023-01-03 18:53:27] <benjameee> it's a quick buck for them
[2023-01-03 18:53:27] <Yao420> thats liek asking why cant i record movies inside a movie theatre
[2023-01-03 18:53:28] <@%GoGoLoThirty> DMCAs arent out of their way. its automated
[2023-01-03 18:53:31] <@%+Ardvatar> @Zerograviti you dont know that theres a 10% conversion rate of people buying  from listening to a song and if that number was right then that'd be absurd

[2023-01-03 18:53:33] <poe_spinner> smca is the way

[2023-01-03 18:53:35] <DementedToad> all about money in the end!
[2023-01-03 18:53:42] <xdwingwingxd> greed
[2023-01-03 18:53:48] <CypherConjured> DMCA actually would take down twitch entirely
[2023-01-03 18:53:48] <@%lemoncoolers> this is a different topic now. Copyright "trolls" (literally called trolls) are paid to "tatle" on people infringing on copyright laws
[2023-01-03 18:53:48] <Sharpblazer> They are Hungry :V $$$ :V
[2023-01-03 18:53:49] <MintberryCrunchS> It might increase your revenue and they probably dont want that ...
[2023-01-03 18:53:56] <@%+Ardvatar> its becaues they COULD be charging you to play the music
[2023-01-03 18:53:58] <%+Pallchek> It indeed is hurting the revenue, because people stop buying the music and listen to it with different ways, like in streams, other videos and such.
[2023-01-03 18:53:59] <%kjlhs> short sighted greed over long term profite
[2023-01-03 18:54:01] <CypherConjured> DMCA is enforced by twitch
[2023-01-03 18:54:13] <@%lemoncoolers> you are talking about that.
[2023-01-03 18:54:13] <@%Kilal2> places like twitch doesn't hurt music. people don't come to twitch to listen to a specific song. They can't
[2023-01-03 18:54:19] <kurogane1979> @Pohx quick question if i ma, can Jugg benefit from cluster jewels ? if yes why we not using it in pob for compariosion maybe ?

[2023-01-03 18:54:28] <@%lemoncoolers> false or not. It's the same thing
[2023-01-03 18:54:28] <@%GoGoLoThirty> @Pallchek this is what my comments were trying to illustrate, but its not exactly like what pohx is saying he is wanting to be possible
[2023-01-03 18:54:37] <+hellsinginst> Your not harming them unless your playing currated music to peoples requests that they can access for free where they could not otherwise.  Its the same thing piracy, On average people that pirate something would not otherwise buy it.   Revenue for content only goes up if its easily available and affordable
[2023-01-03 18:54:40] <CypherConjured> So the label would sue twitch and take down the entire website
[2023-01-03 18:54:43] <+KinKaray> @Pohx My 2 cents. Imagine, your stream, you're playing a song to 630+ people, who are listening for free. 10 people who goes to the spotify/youtube is not a increase that will matter to them. But those 630+ people listening for free matter
[2023-01-03 18:54:54] <@%GoGoLoThirty> @Kilal2 twitch has plenty of streams that just stream music or are "DJs" playing mixes. sure its not on demand, but its still an illegal broadcast of copyrighted material
[2023-01-03 18:55:06] <Joshmoh> @KinKaray they arent going to listen to the music if the streamer isnt playing it
[2023-01-03 18:55:10] <meto4th> Mb It Does hurt their Revenues bec. mb buying or A Subscreption increase the profits
[2023-01-03 18:55:10] <@%lemoncoolers> because someone gets paid for that.
[2023-01-03 18:55:12] <@%GoGoLoThirty> @Kilal2 that being said, the situation Pohx is talking about is why DMCA is a flawed system and a flawed execution
[2023-01-03 18:55:14] <@%+Ardvatar> because legally you don't have the right to stream their music
[2023-01-03 18:55:21] <+x__vindictive> because you don't have a license to broadcast the content
[2023-01-03 18:55:23] <%+Pallchek> @Pallchek people could then start channels without talking much and just providing the music, they get money from donations and such, while the artist and labels do not get the sells
[2023-01-03 18:55:26] <+x__vindictive> that's the crux
[2023-01-03 18:55:27] <+ririreamy> Because you did not make the music?
[2023-01-03 18:55:33] VIEWERS: 644
[2023-01-03 18:55:35] <@%lemoncoolers> but the company was informed by the entity that tattled on you
[2023-01-03 18:55:39] <@%lemoncoolers> THEY get paid
[2023-01-03 18:55:40] <%SearingDarkness> Lemon it feels like you arent engaging with his question
[2023-01-03 18:55:42] <2Mits> so they say that like 1k ppl would go to youtube themselves to listen to that song and see the ads ?
[2023-01-03 18:55:47] <@%lemoncoolers> Yes.
[2023-01-03 18:55:51] <goluu> usually dmca claims are automated
[2023-01-03 18:55:51] <poe_spinner> yes
[2023-01-03 18:55:52] <%voodootrading> Yes, Youtube makes a HUGE deal over it.
[2023-01-03 18:55:53] <+ririreamy> Yes, kinda like that
[2023-01-03 18:55:58] <goluu> this is why there is so much false ones
[2023-01-03 18:55:58] <DEMEME23> problem is having the music recorded in any format
[2023-01-03 18:55:58] <CypherConjured> They have an agreement with twitch basically
[2023-01-03 18:55:58] <%kjlhs> yes because if anyone else wants to listen to that they then have to pay the company
[2023-01-03 18:56:02] <@%+Ardvatar> I don't think it has anything to do with benefit or detriment at the end of the day, its just that you arent allowed to stream it
[2023-01-03 18:56:04] <@%GoGoLoThirty> that happens but thats not where a vast quantity of DMCA action comes from. its just from Content ID systems.
[2023-01-03 18:56:05] <@%Kilal2> @GoGoLoThirty sure, but the main difference is there should be licenses to purchase like radio does. (aka monster cat)
[2023-01-03 18:56:11] <+BeTheWeasel> @Pohx Take the example of a photograph selling its pictures, you could just take a printscreen of the pictures instead of buying them, you are not lowering the revenue directly but you are preventing a gain. (Viewers could be listening to the songs aside instead of hearing it through your stream)
[2023-01-03 18:56:11] <+hellsinginst> They don't distinguish between your content as "free advertisement" and "piracy"
[2023-01-03 18:56:12] <Renegade_Apples> @Pohx DMCA laws are outdated and need to be rewritten for this newer age (unfortunately just like most laws)
[2023-01-03 18:56:12] <+howie_225> well in this instance it's twitch taking you down cause label companies would love to take some amazon money
[2023-01-03 18:56:14] <Joshmoh> it doesnt make sense in your hear because it doesnt make sense in anyones head
[2023-01-03 18:56:19] <+ririreamy> Because they think that the music is the content and not your content
[2023-01-03 18:56:20] <+solwiggin> @Pohx Where does the artist eventually get paid if everyone can use the music for free?
[2023-01-03 18:56:21] <+x__vindictive> the problem is where do you draw the line at "free advertisement"?
[2023-01-03 18:56:25] <+KinKaray> @Joshmoh If the streamer is banned, the streamer probably still listening by himself, but he's not broadcasting for free to everybody else. The problem is the "everybody else listening for free"...
[2023-01-03 18:56:31] <xdwingwingxd> maybe compare it to visual arts getting used without consent
[2023-01-03 18:56:35] <+Cornflayx> They get all the money that the Video makes until it gets taken down that way they make more money then not doing it.
[2023-01-03 18:56:40] <2Mits> the thing is that we that are here now would probably not go to listen to that on ourselves
[2023-01-03 18:57:01] <+ririreamy> Think of the radio, of like a bar using money, they pay a lot more
[2023-01-03 18:57:02] <@%lemoncoolers> Yeah, that's a potential revenue stream for them but record labels/rights holders are dinosaurs and aren't really aware of this stuff yet like content creators
[2023-01-03 18:57:03] <%+kikyo109> the company gets a payment for every time there songs is being played. when you dont pay for the rights to play the song your getting that song for free "napster reference" so the company see's it as stealing? but thats just how my brain is trying to understand all of that
[2023-01-03 18:57:04] <+the_quadruple_double> you're a business, man
[2023-01-03 18:57:07] <%+Pallchek> it is not free advertisement, as their are several downsides and possible problems without the dmca. With a licence, like radio channels, that should be a different thing. but who wants to put in the work to check if you have that licence? Twitch? no they dont want the work
[2023-01-03 18:57:08] <@%GoGoLoThirty> @Kilal2 yes that would be a totally sensible solution. but the big companies would rather do things the old way. spotify pissed of countless music execs. still dont know how they managed to stay afloat (and i am pretty sure it was by ripping off artists to pay off lawyers and licensing )

[2023-01-03 18:58:06] <triedhard> It used to be the case back in the 80's with the cassettes. I changed early 2000's  with the Napster incident. Ever since then they just have stricter and stricter rules.
[2023-01-03 18:58:10] <@%lemoncoolers> Content creators being more prevalent is exactly how companies like monster cat come into existence. It's a new market with opportunity.
[2023-01-03 18:58:18] <%voodootrading> The music execs will screw thier own grandma for a dollar. The only musicians that win are the ones that buy back their own rights.

[2023-01-03 18:58:49] <@%GoGoLoThirty> @lemoncoolers yep. monstercat is a good example of flexible and opportunistic business smarts

[2023-01-03 18:59:05] <%voodootrading> Look at the case with Michael Jackson and SONY, he gave them the big screw job and it was glorious.
[2023-01-03 18:59:12] <@%+Ardvatar> There are bands and musicians that give you the okay to stream their music beyond any DMCA stuff, but the companies doing the DMCA are just big corps that don't need the xposure it feels like.
[2023-01-03 18:59:17] <+hellsinginst> The only valid argument is that the music your streaming gives you a value add, where it does not to the music creator/label.
[2023-01-03 18:59:18] <%SearingDarkness> Monstercat is goated, love them
[2023-01-03 18:59:18] <@%+Ardvatar> Does Drake need Pohx to play his music?
[2023-01-03 18:59:20] <DEMEME23> you can do advertise the msuic, just you cant have a recorded format of it
[2023-01-03 18:59:21] <@%+Ardvatar> no, hes a household name
[2023-01-03 18:59:29] <poe_spinner> the point is (lets stay with drake), they want to sell each bit of the song for big $$, so they only can get through with it if thats the only way to play it. and any piggybacker of that tactic will have to give them a share. if there is no share (coz you do it for free) you  vialte there rules

[2023-01-03 18:59:55] <%voodootrading> @GoGoLoThirty correct.
[2023-01-03 18:59:56] <DementedToad> @Pohx There are ways to stream and listen to what you want and have it removed from the VOD if need be!
[2023-01-03 19:00:20] <+ririreamy> It will when persons start to watch you because of the music instead of you
[2023-01-03 19:00:25] <@%lemoncoolers> Ardvatar has it right. The exposure you think you are providing is so insignificant it only deteriments the rights holders

[2023-01-03 19:00:32] <CypherConjured> DMCA is enforced by twitch to avoid the labels suing them to bring the whole website down, there's no effort by the labels as long as they have an agreement from the website.
[2023-01-03 19:00:43] <+solwiggin> @Pohx where does the music artist eventually get paid in your model?
[2023-01-03 19:00:47] <+KinKaray> @Pohx So, lets simplify... Record labels are greedy, they don't want nobody listening for free. They want to milk every cent out of that song
[2023-01-03 19:00:54] <@%GoGoLoThirty> DMCA is a flawed system, but alternatives arent completely trivial. Its effective in stopping the illegal distribution and broadcast of copyright material. there's just a lot of collateral damage
[2023-01-03 19:01:03] <%Rampant_Badger> the industry doesn't really know how to make money out of it yet, so they shut it "just in case"
[2023-01-03 19:01:07] <+Pipnotiq> It's an archaic act from 1998, it hasn't aged well with the social media age
[2023-01-03 19:01:11] <%SearingDarkness> @Pohx From everything I know the TLDR is that DMCA rules aren't equipped for current internet and lots of higher ups in things like music arent really internet people enough to know
[2023-01-03 19:01:12] <+Pipnotiq> bunch of boomers trying to get money
[2023-01-03 19:01:14] <poe_spinner> would pohx put a dmca claim on drake if he would play rf?
[2023-01-03 19:01:15] <@%lemoncoolers> in the view of the rights holders, that represents a lost sale.
[2023-01-03 19:01:15] <%Strollein> Im not sure if thats how it works but I think the idea is that with free advertisement you might get more exposure but without it people have to pay to listen to the music, so overall they get more money despite the less exposure
[2023-01-03 19:01:15] <%+Pallchek> maybe we should stop talking about the dmca issue? Since we do need seem to come to a conclusion for everybody and it just gets fueled

[2023-01-03 19:01:23] <+solwiggin> @Pohx Because in the model of pay per view on Youtube, if you play it for thousands, that is thousands of free views the artist didn't get paid for
[2023-01-03 19:01:26] <+hellsinginst> your pulling away money, your getting a value add to the "quality" of your stream. So your in theory gaining profit
[2023-01-03 19:01:28] <@%+Ardvatar> In reality, you streaming Drake's music doesn't hurt and MAYBE benefits them slightly but at the end of the day the studio that owns his rights or if he owns those rights to the music they don't care, the law says you need a license to play their music so they act on it.
[2023-01-03 19:01:35] <+sourbeamttv> copyright system was no made or designed around the internet. its dated and you're 100% right

[2023-01-03 19:01:56] <amok1984> No man it's like books. It's not right to read a book for free, that applies to music too.
[2023-01-03 19:02:04] <+Pipnotiq> Nobody comes to streams to listen to free music LUL
[2023-01-03 19:02:08] <+sourbeamttv> yeah and the law is dumb

[2023-01-03 19:02:20] <@%+Ardvatar> does it need to ve revamped? probably
[2023-01-03 19:02:22] <poe_spinner> the music industry is kind of dump
[2023-01-03 19:02:22] <%Rampant_Badger> they don't have a good handle on it, this is the safest way of dealing with it
[2023-01-03 19:02:23] <+sourbeamttv> DMCA needs complete reform
[2023-01-03 19:02:25] <+KinKaray> @Pohx We never said they were smart.... KEKW
[2023-01-03 19:02:26] <%Rampant_Badger> yes - they are out of date
[2023-01-03 19:02:36] <Midkraft> ofc it is dumb, it is super outdated laws LUL
[2023-01-03 19:02:36] <@%lemoncoolers> Look at it this way: You are indirectly monetarily benefiting from playing music you don't have the rights to. Because it enhances your stream.
[2023-01-03 19:02:44] <+BrindleBeard> isnt it more of an outdated way though?
[2023-01-03 19:02:46] <%voodootrading> Its all about the trademark and the lawsuits. They make a fortune from the lawsuits behind the scenes.The Kardashians tried to buy the rights to NORTH and SOUTH and the courts laughed at them.
[2023-01-03 19:02:48] <+solwiggin> @Pohx it starts making sense when you see middle tier artist (like local artist in a major city) who get asked to play events and the pay is "exposure"
[2023-01-03 19:03:08] <+sourbeamttv> thats the best argument so far id say
[2023-01-03 19:03:10] <LouDaCrisp> The other issue is that if they want to strike someone else down and they dont strike you, that can be used against them later on
[2023-01-03 19:03:19] <@%+Ardvatar> that's why stores and banks have specific radio stations they pay for to play music
[2023-01-03 19:03:24] <%Strollein> peepoGlad lemon

[2023-01-03 19:03:58] <@%GoGoLoThirty> It doesn't invalidate it necessarily. It's still efficacious in its original intent. you're just collateral to DMCA and they don't care, thats the issue. there is no impetus for them to change the system because like lemon said, your promotion doesn't really add anything for them

[2023-01-03 19:04:16] <@%+Ardvatar> so studios will need to generate DMCA free music
[2023-01-03 19:04:21] <+howie_225> well a lot of things in business dont make sense to normal individuals, but they have alot of money and pay people to figure out how to keep making money
[2023-01-03 19:04:28] <Midkraft> alot of streamers just play their music over their discords and people just go there if they wanna listen too what the streamer is listening too

[2023-01-03 19:06:58] <@%GoGoLoThirty> @SearingDarkness yeah i mean its just annoying because in some sense it's laziness. but i understand why things are the way they are
[2023-01-03 19:06:59] <%SearingDarkness> Fair point
[2023-01-03 19:07:00] <Renegade_Apples> @Pohx what would happen if you put a radio station on would you still get DMCA since the radio station paid for the licensing?
[2023-01-03 19:07:05] <%voodootrading> its intersting, especially after reading about YE and adidas recently.
[2023-01-03 19:07:16] <@%GoGoLoThirty> @Renegade_Apples yes he would get DMCA
[2023-01-03 19:07:32] <@%+Ardvatar> I mean look at what Blizzard did to Reforged right

[2023-01-03 19:07:39] <%SearingDarkness> @GoGoLoThirty Yup, they need a really good reason to update DMCA and some people on the "interwebs" being upset doesnt really matter when theyre making money regardless
[2023-01-03 19:07:48] <@%GoGoLoThirty> the best illustration of DMCA being a flawed and heavy handed system, is when artists use their own music on social media, they get DMCA'd.
[2023-01-03 19:07:57] <Yao420> and they only started caring when this platform starts making loads of money
[2023-01-03 19:08:02] <mrmoopie> is there a reason for not running vaal RF? tried looking at the written jug guide but i might been overlooking

[2023-01-03 19:08:23] <@%GoGoLoThirty> nintendo is literally the WORST for copyright and streaming and shit
[2023-01-03 19:08:24] <DreamDeckUp> just chill in the main menu for the OST
[2023-01-03 19:08:28] <@%+Ardvatar> when it comes to copyright shit like that Nintendo is the FUCKING WORST
[2023-01-03 19:08:34] <%kjlhs> nintendo is the worst
[2023-01-03 19:08:35] <TheLaranjo> You don't have a license for comercial use, I'd guess
[2023-01-03 19:08:36] <@%GoGoLoThirty> you picked the worst example tho pohx lmaooo, nintendo is SATAN for copyright
[2023-01-03 19:08:37] <2Mits> Just DMCA video games too KEKW
[2023-01-03 19:08:39] <+ririreamy> You are allowed to play, just not stream
[2023-01-03 19:08:40] <%voodootrading> the soundtrack from cities skylines game is not able to be streamed fully even.
[2023-01-03 19:08:42] <@%Kilal2> yeah nintendo are fucks. they're way too greedy with their content creators
[2023-01-03 19:08:44] <%SearingDarkness> Nintendo will deadass shut down your tournament for smash just because they dont like the way you smell, stinky
[2023-01-03 19:08:44] <@%lemoncoolers> it's the fact that you are streaming it that's the problem. Nintendo guards their shit with an iron fist
[2023-01-03 19:08:49] <@%GoGoLoThirty> LUL
[2023-01-03 19:08:51] <Desmaner> japanese companies do follow their own version of DMCA, which is different compared to usa one
[2023-01-03 19:08:53] <clinicall_eh_pc> license to use is different than license to re broadcast
[2023-01-03 19:08:56] <@%+Ardvatar> Nintendo would rather die than let you use their shit
[2023-01-03 19:09:09] <@%GoGoLoThirty> donkey kong got bangers ONLY
[2023-01-03 19:09:14] <NecroRaizo> @pohx I checked 2 other helms one for 20div and the other for 150 that had t1 elemental damage. I was so hyped!!!! now I just need to get the lab enchant on it
[2023-01-03 19:09:15] <2Mits> The most instant dmca would be nintendo game with Rammstein music
[2023-01-03 19:09:17] <@%+Ardvatar> I love 8bit music
[2023-01-03 19:09:20] <@%+Ardvatar> like taht old style gaming music
[2023-01-03 19:09:22] <DementedToad> i think that's wrong , there is a streamer (NO NAME) but he streanms Zelda every stream why not him then?
[2023-01-03 19:09:23] <benjameee> the lesser sense it makes the wider scope it influences so there's that
[2023-01-03 19:09:24] <@%lemoncoolers> there's some remix channels that are stream safe
[2023-01-03 19:09:31] <@%+Ardvatar> thats why I like Loop Hero adn The Last Spell so much

[2023-01-03 19:10:10] <+KinKaray> @Pohx There is a case where an youtuber made a mini documentary (like 15~20 minutes) on a PLANED game, that was never released, with people who no longer worked there. Nintendo tried take down the video
[2023-01-03 19:10:11] <@%GoGoLoThirty> its hard to say what is legitimately safe because DMCA is very convoluted and largely automated.
[2023-01-03 19:10:12] <@%lemoncoolers> there's plenty of indie games with banger soundtracks at least

[2023-01-03 19:11:30] <felixuca> Easy way to look at it is that even if you are a person, you are using the content as a bussiness of sorts...so by streaming you are in fact acting as a firm...
[2023-01-03 19:11:31] <%voodootrading> trademarks and registered is what it all goes back to. You can play any tunes that are over 50 years freely.

[2023-01-03 19:12:00] <JoeyNumbers_> Disney cause they do the actual lobbying to keep it in there best interests.

[2023-01-03 19:19:31] <@%GoGoLoThirty> @Boonfall hm yeah its hard to say. you could try and save up for the benchcrafting? usually currency cant be target farmed too easily like that. you want quant, and then you could try strongboxes or other sort of density/packsize strats additionally.

[2023-01-03 20:34:26] <adolebitque> They get automatically banned by Twitch anyway if you say "I am [insert any age that's under the age of 13]" because of legal reasons
[2023-01-03 20:34:28] <matimp_> @shado712 they are expanding
[2023-01-03 20:34:29] <+HavoksThorn> All creators must ban anyone under 13. Terms of service.

[2023-01-03 20:35:02] <adolebitque> It's not that they get banned from your channel, their entire twitch account gets banned
[2023-01-03 20:35:02] <%+Sadisticmgt> What is the age limit on Twitch anyway?

[2023-01-03 20:36:56] <%Rampant_Badger> arpg in general is pretty boomer
[2023-01-03 20:37:00] <Ninjakens> we all know that ^^

[2023-01-03 20:37:06] <@%lemoncoolers> @enslavedEmperor boomer is a state of mind
[2023-01-03 20:37:11] <@%lemoncoolers> 100%
[2023-01-03 20:37:11] <antrayz> RF? how many projectiles does that throw?
[2023-01-03 20:37:13] <%+Sadisticmgt> Kinda.
[2023-01-03 20:37:13] <@%GoGoLoThirty> yes arpg is more boomer for sure
[2023-01-03 20:37:16] <+Aurkus> Wait a build that doesnt die and is only a couple buttons. Perfect for my boomer brain
[2023-01-03 20:37:17] <%MsSinclaire> arpg is a millenial game
[2023-01-03 20:37:22] <+Arastir> <<is an actual boomer, plays RF
[2023-01-03 20:37:24] <%+Kelsin> I got diablo II in high school etc. Diablo 1 in like 7th grade
[2023-01-03 20:37:25] <%SearingDarkness> Diablo is the closest to Zoomer besides maybe torchlight
[2023-01-03 20:37:25] <@%lemoncoolers> if you unironically enjoy diablo you are a boomer
[2023-01-03 20:37:26] <Wolflux> Yes, makes sense cause D2 was so influential
[2023-01-03 20:37:26] <Evylrune> yep
[2023-01-03 20:37:27] <%Strollein> It is, there is lots of reading which zoomers dont like
[2023-01-03 20:37:30] <%+Sadisticmgt> More Millenial, I think.
[2023-01-03 20:37:32] <simplygrass> arpgs are the types of games my dad used to play when he gamed ages ago

[2023-01-03 20:37:37] <Barritoes> Diablo is boomer
[2023-01-03 20:37:40] <%+Derpstar42> cause they are playing fortnite :D
[2023-01-03 20:37:40] <%Rampant_Badger> generation who grew up on diablo
[2023-01-03 20:37:41] <saiyajin1> they dont get immediate reward

[2023-01-03 20:37:44] <%+kikyo109> they didnt grow up with ff7
[2023-01-03 20:37:44] <Desmaner> too much thinking
[2023-01-03 20:37:46] <%Rampant_Badger> zoomers are all about pvp
[2023-01-03 20:37:46] <439857345053> poe is less rewarding short term than other games
[2023-01-03 20:37:47] <Wolflux> endlessly slaying hordes of monsters does not work with ADHD Kappa
[2023-01-03 20:37:49] <%MagnetToe> I mean -- how many good ARPGs, that are new, have come out recently? There are a couple, but not many
[2023-01-03 20:37:49] <simplygrass> prolly the top down camera i imagine
[2023-01-03 20:37:50] <@%lemoncoolers> because in order to have played Diablo, you have to be old.

[2023-01-03 20:38:19] <myyken> lack of instant gratification
[2023-01-03 20:38:24] <adolebitque> Cookie cutter games like fortnite and roblox has conditioned kids to expect games to have a <30 minute play cycle (and even that's very long for them) until it starts again
[2023-01-03 20:38:33] <%+Kelsin> and the casual advertising is still trying to be a d2 competitor
[2023-01-03 20:38:34] <%enslavedEmperor> i consider poe to be an elementary game
[2023-01-03 20:38:34] <@%GoGoLoThirty> last epoch getting multiplayer on march 9th!!!
[2023-01-03 20:38:35] <@%GoGoLoThirty> very hype
[2023-01-03 20:38:36] <Ninjakens> Last Epoch will take off

[2023-01-03 20:38:44] <%shado712> last epoch is nit, watitign for full release
[2023-01-03 20:38:44] <%Rampant_Badger> multiplayer for last epoch will be big
[2023-01-03 20:38:51] <Ninjakens> game is still in production
[2023-01-03 20:38:54] <saiyajin1> does it comes with friends to play with Sadge
[2023-01-03 20:38:58] <@%GoGoLoThirty> yes zoomers would actually cry if they tried to play poe
[2023-01-03 20:38:59] <Ninjakens> even if it is a Pog game
[2023-01-03 20:39:04] <+HavoksThorn> Last Epoch is super good. Its def got the design space to take off. ARPG's are kindve old school genre these days so we shall see.
[2023-01-03 20:39:17] <Motarkus> every time my kid's playing fortnite he sits in the lobby beeing angry. i tell him to stop playing if he doenst not enjoy it. but he continues anyway i dont get it
[2023-01-03 20:39:24] <%shado712> yoo that game is pog
[2023-01-03 20:39:43] <%enslavedEmperor> @motarkus thats me when i do maven LOLE
[2023-01-03 20:39:44] <+Pipnotiq> @Motarkus He probably gets super hyped when he wins though
[2023-01-03 20:39:46] <+Pipnotiq> that's the appeal
[2023-01-03 20:39:47] <%+Walldasher> I play RF because I just have to walk forward
[2023-01-03 20:39:50] <@%GoGoLoThirty> @Motarkus its competitive mentality. plenty of ppl are like that with games these days. there is a pressure from various places, peers, sm, etc, to be good at the game

[2023-01-03 21:13:47] <+killerkev069> I promise you @GoGoLoThirty That you are right
[2023-01-03 21:13:52] <+Pi_Kitsune> are you gonna be farming Exarch for the shield or is it not worth it?
[2023-01-03 21:14:08] <%SearingDarkness> It's because when you're out with other introverts its like a kid having their comfort blanket. When you wanna stop doing the extrovert shit you turn to your friends next to you
[2023-01-03 21:14:11] <%+CaptRedBeeerd> @gogolothirty Wouldn’t surprise me a bit.

I made a ton of money off blight this league with like 6 points in blight nodes because blighted/ravaged maps dont count as actual maps

[2023-01-03 21:46:30] <@%GoGoLoThirty> basically the rule of thumb is: if the thing you are putting in your map is on the atlas (like where you see all the maps interconnected), it is affected by passives on the atlas tree specifying "maps" if its not, then it isnt affected.
