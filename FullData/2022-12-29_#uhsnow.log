[2022-12-29 14:02:07] <%Bushelz> trades in the US are a lot of money and they will train you on the job
[2022-12-29 14:02:08] <+PiemanUK80> the best one was the guy who got turned down for a job as his time experience in the program they used wasnt enough time, and he wrote the program they used.....
[2022-12-29 14:02:08] <%iBeastVii> Most streamers had to work shitty jobs to get here
[2022-12-29 14:02:09] <Ericj20> I went to college to get a Bachelors in History, I got it, I now work in Health Insurance, my degree is just an expensive piece of paper for what I actually do for work.
[2022-12-29 14:02:09] <%+xPandorra> I'm a contractor for the DOD and they care more about your experience and whether or not you can do the job. They don't care much about degrees.
[2022-12-29 14:02:09] <asterisk0o> Degrees are usually a filter when you have massive amounts of applications
[2022-12-29 14:02:12] <%D4rkmask> @GodIsD3AD762 100% i love learning, i just hate being told what im going to learn, and when im going to learn it...
[2022-12-29 14:02:29] <+daemonchill> @JordxnFair yes.. the degree requirement for app development is going away.. even the big 3 are hiring people without degrees
[2022-12-29 14:02:31] <epiloguesound> Aren't you also like a Bollywood movie star? @uhSnow Kappa
[2022-12-29 14:02:32] <%Cugix> I really wouldn't be able to do retail...

[2022-12-29 14:03:09] <+PiemanUK80> @LupusNoctis what made it even funnier is that he listed it on his CV
[2022-12-29 14:03:13] <asterisk0o> Almost as old as kyle
[2022-12-29 14:03:15] <%cooll> im going to uni for journalism right now but most of my work experience is in things like plumbing and being an electrician

[2022-12-29 14:03:23] <%+ItsFatRabbit> I think everyone should have to work in retail once so that they aren’t arseholes to retail workers
[2022-12-29 14:03:24] <+LupusNoctis> yeah, ride that wave to financial independance!

[2022-12-29 14:37:04] <+Domre> time for some science
[2022-12-29 14:37:05] <%+rryder8100> the new models are waterproof up to a certain depth
[2022-12-29 14:37:06] <DerRukz> As long as you don't plug it in right afterwards, you're fine.
[2022-12-29 14:37:09] <%+the_only_tetra> most are waterproof now
[2022-12-29 14:37:10] <+Sieder14> depends what phgone you got, Most new phones are water resistant of like 1.5m
[2022-12-29 14:37:11] <%+NinaNincompoop> New iPhones are waterproof now
[2022-12-29 14:37:11] <+Veradak> @uhSnow it say on the box if its waterproof
[2022-12-29 14:37:11] <JaggedNA> He uses his phone to jerk off in the tub clearly
[2022-12-29 14:37:11] <@%$Slasher2099> you just have to be carefull on the charging port
[2022-12-29 14:37:14] <%CarolineSwitched> Waterproof speaker in the bath is as far as I'll go.
[2022-12-29 14:37:18] <Tickktack> @peris_notparis hahaha i know!  I just hope the pool chemicals are doing their job lol
[2022-12-29 14:37:18] <%starwhistle517> Always try to pull moisture out
[2022-12-29 14:37:20] <%+peris_notparis> Rice works because it dries it faster
[2022-12-29 14:37:23] <+DanLGG> Most newer iPhones are waterproof. You can take photos underwater
[2022-12-29 14:37:27] <@%$Slasher2099> and dry that up properly but other than that there should be no area where water can do anything
[2022-12-29 14:37:29] <vida__loca___> only reason why rice works is it summons China men to come fix the phone
[2022-12-29 14:37:29] <%slapperofbutts> if the phone is one, wont it short it out? make it useless?
[2022-12-29 14:37:37] <+fission248> don't do that
[2022-12-29 14:37:38] <%+Paralyzor> they arent water proof but resistant up to a certain distance
[2022-12-29 14:37:39] <%artwezi> If you have dropped your phone it’s going to get messed up not advised I mess mine up
[2022-12-29 14:37:41] <@%$Slasher2099> yeah i was pushed into a pool with my phone in my pocket
[2022-12-29 14:37:44] <%+milkydeew> some people shower then have a bath, because of bathing in dirty water
[2022-12-29 14:37:44] <+DanLGG> I still don’t put my phone in the bath even though they say it’s safe
[2022-12-29 14:37:45] <@%$Slasher2099> and it was fine
[2022-12-29 14:37:48] <+fission248> you don't want to be heating anything up
[2022-12-29 14:37:48] <%+ReverSpace> rice can help remove moisture but leaves corrosive resedue behind
[2022-12-29 14:37:50] <%+the_only_tetra> @vida__loca___ noooooooooooooo noooooooooo nooooooooooooo
[2022-12-29 14:37:53] <%+peris_notparis> Overheat
[2022-12-29 14:37:57] <%starwhistle517> Had my screen fixed twice for cracks not when it gets wet it flickers the screen till I blow dry it lol
[2022-12-29 14:37:57] <%+olzbolzz> little bits of tissue, take them out with a cocktail stick :)
[2022-12-29 14:37:59] <%iBeastVii> Heat destroys phones
[2022-12-29 14:38:00] <@%$Slasher2099> if you use a hair dryer don't set it to max temp
[2022-12-29 14:38:11] <%$MarinoV1> most hair dryers have a "no heat" option
[2022-12-29 14:38:12] <%D4rkmask> ^
[2022-12-29 14:38:14] <%+Marcistopheles> I just put my phone in the toaster I keep by the bath
[2022-12-29 14:38:14] <@%$Slasher2099> not the heat from a blow dryer boys cmon
[2022-12-29 14:38:15] <+simply_striking> most phones are water proof to splashes and small dips, but at the time I have yet to hear someone have a successful warranty claim for water ingression
[2022-12-29 14:38:17] <%+peris_notparis> Lol
[2022-12-29 14:38:17] <+fission248> cold would be fine
[2022-12-29 14:38:17] <@%$Slasher2099> KEKW
[2022-12-29 14:38:18] <%slapperofbutts> its all about protecting the delicate circuit bits
[2022-12-29 14:38:20] <JaggedNA> You mean a fan?
[2022-12-29 14:38:23] <+DanLGG> Yeah hair dryer can melt soldering in phones
[2022-12-29 14:38:25] <%dabbasaurus19> i think thats a fan
[2022-12-29 14:38:26] <%D4rkmask> hairdryer should be fine as long as your not blasting the heat NODDERS
[2022-12-29 14:38:29] <vida__loca___> @the_only_tetra whhhaaat?  is that wrong to say? I'm so sorry
[2022-12-29 14:38:30] <@%$Slasher2099> it's not like it pushes out fucking 80c
[2022-12-29 14:38:35] <%+peris_notparis> @slapperofbutts circuit bits sounds dirty
[2022-12-29 14:38:37] <@%$Slasher2099> cmon boys
[2022-12-29 14:38:37] <%+ReverSpace> use alcohol 99% dispels water and evaperates
[2022-12-29 14:38:38] <+Sieder14> Just leave the phone be to dry it's self, Just dont charge it for like 2 hours
[2022-12-29 14:38:38] <%+peris_notparis> Or rice!
[2022-12-29 14:38:40] <+Veradak> @uhSnow but dont drop it in boiling water i have had the plastic melt or somthing
[2022-12-29 14:38:44] <JaggedNA> Fan > cold hair dryer
[2022-12-29 14:38:44] <+MozzyMercs> Never had water issue with my phone and not cautions with it eitehr
