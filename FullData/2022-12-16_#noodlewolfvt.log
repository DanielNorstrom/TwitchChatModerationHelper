[2022-12-16 00:05:43] <Jackseptay_FeatherFadora> nope there are 10 because it's $10,000 on their medical bills

[2022-12-16 00:20:16] <@%MaruAmoriani> Well, off I go to bash my head into the brick wall that is Party Finder(Ultimate) to find a group that can handle birds and towers.
[2022-12-16 00:20:27] <%Hermysko> I tried FFXIV and beated Realm reborn, but then my character just got Thanos snaped
[2022-12-16 00:20:36] <itsjust_moonlight> heyyy
[2022-12-16 00:20:36] <%reivehnfliyt> ah I gotta go to work soon but I'll get to use my new wireless headphones on the way which is pure awesome
[2022-12-16 00:20:47] <@%MaruAmoriani> I don't have friends who are also progging it so
[2022-12-16 00:21:04] <%Hermysko> Just loged in and poof, my character gone
[2022-12-16 00:21:06] <@%MaruAmoriani> All of my friends are progging 5 and 6
[2022-12-16 00:21:27] <@%MaruAmoriani> It's why I run learning parties
[2022-12-16 00:21:33] <@%MaruAmoriani> To help people prog

[2022-12-16 00:22:11] <@%MaruAmoriani> Biggest problem with Party Finder is people that don't actually want to learn the fight
[2022-12-16 00:22:13] <%+tom8080> I off until 3rd Jan from today worked like 6 months straight
[2022-12-16 00:22:15] <%Hermysko> Want to give it a try again someday, but dont really want to do realm reborn again tbh
[2022-12-16 00:22:26] <@%MaruAmoriani> They just want to be carried through it
[2022-12-16 00:22:26] <%$Dio444777> still haven't played FF14. i'm a final fantasy fan and an mmo fan so by all logic i should have played it by now
[2022-12-16 00:22:41] <@%MaruAmoriani> And this tier is NOT capable of that.
[2022-12-16 00:22:58] <%+EvilD3edz__> I could not get into FF14, new WoW xpac is pretty awesome though
[2022-12-16 00:23:11] <@%MaruAmoriani> There are too many mechanics that if one person fucks up everyone is dead
[2022-12-16 00:23:32] <%+EvilD3edz__> This is the first time I've ever gone through a WoW xpac and actually read the quest
[2022-12-16 00:23:37] <%+EvilD3edz__> Lore so far has been great
[2022-12-16 00:23:38] <@%MaruAmoriani> Slander
[2022-12-16 00:23:41] <@%MaruAmoriani> ARR is great
[2022-12-16 00:24:00] <@%MaruAmoriani> Exposition is important for a long contiguous story
[2022-12-16 00:24:11] VIEWERS: 254
[2022-12-16 00:24:12] <@%MaruAmoriani> It does set up the story being a slow burn
[2022-12-16 00:24:15] <@%MaruAmoriani> I disagree a lot
[2022-12-16 00:24:29] <@%MaruAmoriani> Stormblood pacing is way too fast. Like they just jump past so much shit
[2022-12-16 00:24:30] <%+tom8080> ppl play mmos for story?
[2022-12-16 00:24:38] <%Hermysko> @EvilD3edz__ ARR story was ok first time, but second time I think I will pass
[2022-12-16 00:24:44] <%+tom8080> I only ever pvpd
[2022-12-16 00:24:48] <@%MaruAmoriani> FFXIV is a Final Fantasy game first and a MMO second
[2022-12-16 00:24:58] <%$Dio444777> @tom8080 i like swtor because it's much more story-oriented than most mmos
[2022-12-16 00:25:06] <@%MaruAmoriani> It is not an MMORPG
[2022-12-16 00:25:11] <@%MaruAmoriani> It is a RPGMMO
[2022-12-16 00:25:34] <@%MaruAmoriani> It's a game about the story and everything is in service to that.
[2022-12-16 00:25:37] <Jackseptay_FeatherFadora> it's gamer Time come on grab your friends oh wait I already abandon them with Cheeto fingers and take out containers the fun never ends in gamer time
[2022-12-16 00:25:45] <@%MaruAmoriani> Also the gameplay stands on it's own
[2022-12-16 00:25:46] <%Hermysko> I like loot angels80Nodders
[2022-12-16 00:25:52] <@%MaruAmoriani> Each element stands well on it's own
[2022-12-16 00:25:55] <@%MaruAmoriani> Which is great
[2022-12-16 00:26:11] VIEWERS: 254
[2022-12-16 00:26:15] <@%MaruAmoriani> But it is, in the end, a final fantasy game. So all things about the game are in service to the story itself.
[2022-12-16 00:26:41] <%$Dio444777> how is dragonflight? i haven't played wow since mists of pandaria
[2022-12-16 00:26:45] <Jackseptay_FeatherFadora> I'm sorry but it's time that I must take my leave
[2022-12-16 00:27:12] <%+tom8080> @Dio444777 haven't played since cata, I kinda wanna pick it up
[2022-12-16 00:27:19] <@%MaruAmoriani> It also informs you to pay attention to the story. There is a lot going on. ARR is the foundation of the story
[2022-12-16 00:27:27] <@%MaruAmoriani> Without it none of the rest makes sense.
[2022-12-16 00:27:28] <%Hermysko> Is dragonflight story big bad guy too op and bad but you beat him?
[2022-12-16 00:27:47] <%$Dio444777> TBC and WOTLK were the good old days. it was never the same after cata

[2022-12-16 19:53:03] <$JaywalkerN49> to be fair, "there is no women on the internet" is a shorthand for a longer explanation of how anonymity works, and a more accurate statement would be "there is no benefit to being a woman if nobody knows you are one"

[2022-12-16 20:52:34] <%nojouplays> Like some black holes are way too big the natural growth of black holes would make them impossible except if black hole stars aka stars that formed at the early stages of the universe where everything was very densely packed together which could have made such giant stars possible and in theory those stars survived their own supernovas which caused a black hole inside them which allowed the massive black holes to exist

[2022-12-16 21:25:44] <%nojouplays> His power is all fiction if he wants to do it he can
[2022-12-16 21:25:56] <comfyBee333> early stream wohoo
[2022-12-16 21:25:57] <7_up_gamer> yeah
[2022-12-16 21:26:00] <%nojouplays> He is also aware he is in an anime and he is caught up on all anime
[2022-12-16 21:26:38] <7_up_gamer> and he can just imagine his screw turns into a train but the same thing happens if the train hits someone
[2022-12-16 21:26:41] <%nojouplays> Like against goku he can say saiyans dont exist
[2022-12-16 21:26:49] <%$LederIappen> But I don’t wanna spoil anything for anybody since Season 3 of One Punch Man will come out next Year

[2022-12-16 21:27:33] <$JaywalkerN49> TBH, I'd rather a character be too strong than too dumb
[2022-12-16 21:27:49] <%nojouplays> Nobody can beat that mf
[2022-12-16 21:27:50] <7_up_gamer> but let's be real he can also become his own worst enemy.
[2022-12-16 21:28:02] <%$LederIappen> @nojouplays As i Said, i will not spoil anything, no more to be said
[2022-12-16 21:28:31] <%nojouplays> Thank you for not spoiling but saitama will lose eventho i love saitama i cant bet on him
[2022-12-16 21:28:43] <+toptropicanical> There's characters who have no power that are smart so there powerful and characters that are powerful and not all that smart.
[2022-12-16 21:29:08] <7_up_gamer> if he says end all that will oppose me he would have a big chance of killing innocent children and he would instantly regret his decision
[2022-12-16 21:29:12] <%$LederIappen> There is one ability that would make it possible for Saitama to win, maybe, but still it’s aight

[2022-12-16 21:29:41] <7_up_gamer> @lederiappen if he's faster then a thought then yes
[2022-12-16 21:29:55] <%nojouplays> misogi kumagawa could just say saitama has no abilities
[2022-12-16 21:30:30] <7_up_gamer> but also he can just imagine it won't even give me a scratch and he'll walk trough the Kame hame
[2022-12-16 21:30:31] <%nojouplays> Oh misogi kumagawa isnt a mc
[2022-12-16 21:30:35] <%nojouplays> He is a side character
[2022-12-16 21:30:45] <%$LederIappen> @nojouplays Technically Saitama already has no Abilities, it’s all his Body Strength
[2022-12-16 21:30:52] <%Tadas13571> so what are we talking about today
[2022-12-16 21:30:57] <%nojouplays> So he can say saitama is disabled

[2022-12-16 21:32:30] <+toptropicanical> ah yeah they aren't the best.
[2022-12-16 21:32:30] <%$LederIappen> One of my All time Favorite Animes is Death Note
[2022-12-16 21:32:57] <+wojna1> average shonen anime then LUL
[2022-12-16 21:33:03] <+toptropicanical> Yeah Sasukes a bit full of himself but he backs it up.
[2022-12-16 21:33:13] <$JaywalkerN49> Sasuke is "what if Batman had no redeeming qualities"
[2022-12-16 21:33:28] <%$LederIappen> Light has a very interesting type of God Complex that makes it very enjoyable

[2022-12-16 21:33:47] <%nojouplays> You would love overlord probably
[2022-12-16 21:33:49] <%+Draile_Runescar> Sasuke what would you do for a koldike bar? I'd kill my brother

[2022-12-16 21:34:30] <%nojouplays> Imo overlord is the second best anime
[2022-12-16 21:34:32] <%+Draile_Runescar> just say I misspelled it
[2022-12-16 21:34:37] <%Tadas13571> batmans abilitys are money
[2022-12-16 21:34:58] <+wojna1> @Tadas13571 yes indeed LUL
[2022-12-16 21:35:02] <%nojouplays> If they didnt cut so much content from the manga and werent lazy with some background characters overlord would be the best anime
[2022-12-16 21:35:02] <%$LederIappen> @nojouplays What’s the best in your Opinion?
[2022-12-16 21:35:12] <%nojouplays> Attack on titan
[2022-12-16 21:35:17] <%+Draile_Runescar> Guts from beserk is one my fave characters in anime
[2022-12-16 21:35:17] <%Tadas13571> for me overlored is my number one anime
[2022-12-16 21:35:30] VIEWERS: 243
[2022-12-16 21:35:38] <%nojouplays> Actually hmm
[2022-12-16 21:35:46] <%$LederIappen> @nojouplays Understandable, very very Good, but not the best I’d say
[2022-12-16 21:35:48] <+wojna1> @Tadas13571 overlored with lizzards having sex xqcHead xqcHead
[2022-12-16 21:35:57] <7_up_gamer> @jaywalkern49 I thought he was a rich guy whit extreme issues, became depressed, decided to be like the typical kidnapper and just fight bozos that wear or make-up or wear some freaky mask.
[2022-12-16 21:35:58] <%nojouplays> Attack on titan is not something i ever consider rewatching but overlord i rewatch alot
[2022-12-16 21:36:11] <%nojouplays> So my fav might be overlord
[2022-12-16 21:36:11] <%$LederIappen> @draile_runescar Propably the character with the most fucked up Backstory in all of Anime tho
[2022-12-16 21:36:23] <%Tadas13571> we do not talk about the lizerd sex
[2022-12-16 21:36:26] <%+Draile_Runescar> AOT the anime bad after the first season the manga? pretty good
[2022-12-16 21:36:41] <%nojouplays> If overlord was 100% accurate to the manga overlord would be my top 1 never to be questioned

[2022-12-16 21:38:29] <$JaywalkerN49> @7_up_gamer Batman, when written by a competent writer, is a very fragile person coping with immense grief, contrasted with his villains who have lost their battle against simular struggles.
[2022-12-16 21:38:51] <+wojna1> @LederIappen I will wait then, I thought that was the last season but it seems not LUL
