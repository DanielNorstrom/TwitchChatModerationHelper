[2022-12-29 16:25:07] <+beaverb0nes> So annoying. I get a 'server disconnect error' when trying to load into raid, but then the main menu says my character is in raid, so I try to reconnect. I keep getting errors until someone kills my body and I lose everything. I can load into offline raids fine. Anyone else dealing with that?

[2022-12-29 19:11:02] <demig0dd> endless queues is not because of no player. its opposite. if you do not get a que in 7-8 mins just back out and queue again
[2022-12-29 19:11:03] <+dizzle_thedad> @whatsoriginality that’s cause too many players are scared to run pmc exclusively

[2022-12-29 20:06:02] <+Raaiders> @MadDogHux because his competition is on. He shares viewers with other streamers...just happens
[2022-12-29 20:06:02] <Erikxson> once you have more endurance and strength the viewers come back

[2022-12-29 20:21:48] <%trogg_> I’ve had my phone on stream all day in my pocket while at work to collect drops
[2022-12-29 20:22:06] <%+glocknessmonstattv> How is the AUG? I havent used it yet.
[2022-12-29 20:22:08] <@%^Nightbot> Remember guys, if you are liking the content. Hit that follow button and be reminded when willerz goes live.
[2022-12-29 20:22:16] <+trevandezz> @willerz it’d be funny if they replaced level with age. ‘Im 12 years old.’ And you’re an old ass man at age 70
[2022-12-29 20:22:20] <%+SweetBabyChang> @glocknessmonstattv it's good, but horizontal recoil on it is insane
[2022-12-29 20:22:37] <%FlankSinatra___> can the aug be modded?
[2022-12-29 20:22:38] <%+glocknessmonstattv> @SweetBabyChang Probably poopoo attachments for it too, so far?

[2022-12-29 20:23:00] <%+SweetBabyChang> @glocknessmonstattv yeah, only attachments i've seen are the ones that came with the one BSG gave out
[2022-12-29 20:23:05] <%+glocknessmonstattv> @FlankSinatra___ You can definitely put a suppressor on it.
[2022-12-29 20:23:07] <@%^Nightbot> @WillerZ - OCULUS AUDIO IS SCUFFED | LIGHTHOUSE - Escape from Tarkov - https://youtu.be/d9nE5zW7tqc

[2022-12-29 20:23:09] <+MAC_TEC> yes it can have longer barrel and a silencer
[2022-12-29 20:23:19] <%+Seraphis418> i got a full sized aug last night, came with the picatinny rail
[2022-12-29 20:23:19] <%+TatsuWamma> probably a few secret ones
[2022-12-29 20:23:20] <%trogg_> @neptuneeh I work on a farm lol
[2022-12-29 20:23:23] <+trevandezz> Damn that was a good idea. They should make your character start at age 30 and get to age 75. Different choices lead to different health problems. @willerz would have very bad knees in old age
[2022-12-29 20:23:25] <%+Seraphis418> found it a weapons crate

[2022-12-29 20:25:21] <+Avindale> @schnellersven yeah, you need to log into the game at least once
[2022-12-29 20:25:25] <+nuggywuggybuggy> @schnellersven I claimed my first one and I haven’t played Tarkov in months

[2022-12-29 20:29:01] <@%^Nightbot> At the start of every wipe, WillerZ always plays with his buddy - DestroyerProject. Do yourself, Will and Destroyer a solid and go drop him a follow and check him out!   https://www.twitch.tv/destroyerproject
[2022-12-29 20:29:04] <%+glocknessmonstattv> @glocknessmonstattv Maybe they put them back in all the other places they robbed them from. Like the end of the road on Shoreline by the ambulances.
[2022-12-29 20:29:05] <%highinsodium> how is the aug @WillerZ
[2022-12-29 20:29:13] <F1lthyCa5ua1> I turned the Binaural Audio off and it almost seems easier to pinpoint the direction the audio is coming from, Ive always had it on i dont think ill turn it back on now tbh
[2022-12-29 20:29:26] <+ShardenTV> did they add more scav spawns? I dont think i ever saw any in that town.
[2022-12-29 20:29:36] <%mitsuguy91> @glocknessmonstattv First raid to get jaegers letter went running through for the sweet loots. Got one tapped to face by 7.62 PS scav.
[2022-12-29 20:29:59] <%+glocknessmonstattv> @ShardenTV They used to be there all the time. They took them out a couple wipes ago for whatever reason.
[2022-12-29 20:30:00] <noeffortttv> @willerz can any stream have drops enabled on their stream
[2022-12-29 20:30:01] <%+yomabloodd> you need that for later tho

[2022-12-29 20:34:36] <+TheMoneylizard> @Gauntsghost025 like 13-17 min

[2022-12-29 20:34:47] <%+glocknessmonstattv> @Gauntsghost025 Depends on the map, probably. However, the servers are usually fucked for the first few days of wipe.

[2022-12-29 20:34:52] <%+n1ghthavvk31> @glocknessmonstattv yea, set myself up for that one lol
[2022-12-29 20:34:52] <F1lthyCa5ua1> @Machlen I run it perfectly fine on a 970 so i would say CPU Tarkov mainly needs CPU and RAM

[2022-12-29 20:35:23] <Machlen> @F1lthyCa5ua1 see that's what I gathered from forums and stuff too so i thought so
[2022-12-29 20:35:27] <warliczek> @WillerZ they added claymore mines to eft this wipe, just saw a ss (not sure its 100% legit)
[2022-12-29 20:35:45] <%+TatsuWamma> i think there are placed claymores on lighthouse
[2022-12-29 20:35:50] <%DonkeShow> @warliczek lol i have some stuff i would like to sell you
[2022-12-29 20:35:51] <%+TatsuWamma> but not usable maybe??
[2022-12-29 20:35:55] <%+glocknessmonstattv> @Machlen I was trying to play EFT with a 1060. Every time I had a scope and would ADS, it was always so laggy and stuttery. Even at low settings. 1660's are still pretty cheap right now, and that would do you SO much better.
[2022-12-29 20:35:58] <F1lthyCa5ua1> @Machlen Streets is the only map i have framerate issues on
[2022-12-29 20:35:58] <1Treez> What map is this?
