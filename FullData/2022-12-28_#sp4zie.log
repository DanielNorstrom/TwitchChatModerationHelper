Feel like the bigger games are always a bigger time commitment so harder to pick them in the moment

[2022-12-28 11:26:52] <!%$dyson1> NOTED
[2022-12-28 11:26:57] <%Beaglecheoreom> hmm... i definitely feel you there Dyson. I guess you can try to plan ahead when you have time, because for me what stops me is that i don't start because i think i'll have to restart again if i don't have time
[2022-12-28 11:26:58] <@%MacYodaNL> @dyson1 i think it all depends on the time you have for such a gamesession. If i have smoll time, its League/TFT, if i have more time i play Dawen Of Man or smt else

[2022-12-28 11:51:06] <@%MacYodaNL> We’ll be selecting a large group of channels for the experiment. If you’re selected, when your community starts a Hype Train, there’s a chance that Boost reward may appear as one of the Hype Train rewards.
[2022-12-28 11:51:38] <@%MacYodaNL> Boost Train is a supercharged Hype Train where viewers can purchase recurring or gift subscriptions or use Bits to unlock a boost reward in addition to other Hype Train rewards. The Boost reward promotes streamer's channels to highly visible parts of Twitch. This promotion can help more viewers discover you, your community, and your content. Streamers receive the same revenue from recurring subs, gift subs, and Bits contributed as part of Boost Train as they would normally.
