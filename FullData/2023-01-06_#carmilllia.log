[2023-01-06 09:42:48] <%StromkoPenguin> My general looting rule in this game, don't loot anything that costs less than 10 gold per 1 weight.
[2023-01-06 09:42:54] <%Late_Night_Vision> milliThumbsup u got this, just enjoy and do whatever u want. Its the best part how free you are, most have never beaten the game
