"No, it's snowing," replies the woman. "How about we ask the Communist officer here? He is always right!" exclaims the man. "Officer Rudolph, is it raining or snowing?" "Definitely raining," Officer Rudolph replies before walking off. The man turns to his wife with a smile. "See? Rudolph the Red knows rain, dear."

[2022-12-18 10:44:27] <%$Memil03> If u take all mele infatry and lock them and then attack they will all walk forward and attack untill they meet somthing to fight more or less
[2022-12-18 10:44:35] <%McMarschall> only ever lock control groups of infantry for a line charge, otherwise it mostly hurts you in my experience

[2022-12-18 10:53:02] <%Iffiie> @McMarschall prolly the remaining eldar gods would get some semblanse of power back yokaiSip
[2022-12-18 10:53:02] <Rahsed> Chaos gods can't really be killed and they're strange because they existed before they were even created. Warp is weird.

[2022-12-18 10:54:17] <%+hugz4genestealers> time and the laws of causality don't work the same way in the warp
[2022-12-18 10:54:21] <%+Maleqai> there's no such thing as "time" in the warp
[2022-12-18 10:55:04] <@%^StreamElements> Did you know you can support Cerise by subscribing with Twitch Prime? And it's totally free!
[2022-12-18 10:55:19] <%+hugz4genestealers> like, Slaanesh was first born when the Eldar civilization fell, but Slaanesh has also always existed, from a certain point of view
[2022-12-18 10:55:27] <!Aaron_Kessinger> ha yes, the famous tale of the ork warboss that travelled in the warp, came back before he left and killed himself so he could have two of his favorite gun LUL
[2022-12-18 10:55:46] <%+Maleqai> It's why some of the original Chaos Space Marines are still alive  and combat worthy even 10,000 years after the horus heresy, but it also means that they're all competing for the chaos gods' attention so they don't get warp-fucked
[2022-12-18 10:55:49] <wild_saber1337> everyone is like it's impossible for the eldar to get the magic sword back from slaneeshs palace but people conveniently for get the one race that has no presents in the warp and would go unnoticed.....the tau
[2022-12-18 10:55:53] <%+Maleqai> even more than they already are I guess

[2022-12-18 10:56:02] <Rahsed> Also there used to be a fifth Chaos god and someone might try to tell me that's proof that they can die. But he was defeated by the most powerful thing, real life copyright laws. novaKappa
[2022-12-18 10:56:34] <%+Maleqai> @wild_saber1337 I thought they just had a "weak" presence, not entirely devoid

[2022-12-18 10:57:25] <%+Maleqai> heirotitan would be very good
[2022-12-18 10:57:33] <%+hugz4genestealers> your low tier stuff gets brutalized by armor
[2022-12-18 10:57:35] <Rahsed> Yeah there was a Chaos god called Malal but the person who created him was fired from Games Workshop or something and they had to remove all mentions of the character for one reason or another.
[2022-12-18 10:57:41] <!Aaron_Kessinger> most anti infantry armor piercing really :D

[2022-12-18 10:58:04] <wild_saber1337> the tau went into the warp unprotected during a warp jump and everyone went crazy and mad but the tau were completely fine
[2022-12-18 10:58:16] <+FinalCipher> i freaking love bone giants as khalida
[2022-12-18 10:58:34] <%+hugz4genestealers> early game TK can feel really weak, but its fun to hit late game and you can just have a posse of like 8 armies running around together
[2022-12-18 10:58:36] <+FinalCipher> they're archers so massive that they can shoot cities
[2022-12-18 10:58:43] <+FinalCipher> and in khalida's hands they're absurd
[2022-12-18 10:58:48] <%+Maleqai> I like to think Gork and Mork are just angry Neanderthals that just steal random shit from the rest of the gods in the warp
[2022-12-18 10:59:06] <+FinalCipher> get a liche priest with a firing rate spell, and a bone giant can just machine gun super artillery arrows onto an army
[2022-12-18 10:59:07] <%$Memil03> khalida buffs archers! idk if she does buff bone giant tho
[2022-12-18 10:59:24] <+FinalCipher> yeah khalida buffs bone giants and even sepulchral stalkers

[2022-12-18 11:00:20] <wild_saber1337> the tau went into the warp unprotected during a warp jump and everyone went crazy and mad but the tau were completely fine
[2022-12-18 11:00:24] <!Aaron_Kessinger> that's fair, the mortals are but vassals to you
[2022-12-18 11:00:28] <+FinalCipher> khalida is amazing with trade
[2022-12-18 11:01:07] <%+hugz4genestealers> I think wood elves is the only faction i've ever made a full army with literally no melee units
[2022-12-18 11:01:31] <+FinalCipher> @hugz4genestealers i've done that with khalida, it's so effective

[2022-12-18 11:26:10] <%$Memil03> @chaliceofpower hmm atm to play the big map u need to get all the games before so warhammer 1 2 and 3
[2022-12-18 11:26:11] <mysoulishate1> with an sale for the dlc yes
[2022-12-18 11:26:35] <Rahsed> Eeesh
[2022-12-18 11:26:42] <chaliceofpower> ok thx
[2022-12-18 11:26:45] <%Iffiie> twwh1 and twwh2 the best dlcs yokaiLUL
[2022-12-18 11:26:47] <mysoulishate1> i would say wait to the Winter sale
[2022-12-18 11:26:58] <%Synesh> You'll need a big sale for this game. It's not as bad Stellaris, it's not consumer friendly either.
[2022-12-18 11:26:58] <+vodsquad4life> $$$
[2022-12-18 11:27:00] <%Edorah> you can play the big map with only game 3 tho, just dont have access to the factions of old
[2022-12-18 11:27:04] <%+hugz4genestealers> it's a franchise that they've been putting content out for for like 5 years
[2022-12-18 11:27:09] <%$Memil03> there is a thing going atm the comutiy of total war are trying to make mortal empire so u can play it with only owing warhammer 3 tho to play the old races u need tho old games
[2022-12-18 11:27:09] <%+hugz4genestealers> so it's not cheap to get everything
[2022-12-18 11:27:10] <%Synesh> Primeraly because the pricing of the other 2 games are still too high years later
[2022-12-18 11:27:40] <%Iffiie> really expensive if you buy all

[2022-12-18 11:28:01] <%$Memil03> so we are all praying that they will lisen and make it so you dont need to buy the other warhammer games to play mortal empires yokaiRNG
[2022-12-18 11:28:05] <%Edorah> "even the tabletop"... thats the most expensive thing about it :D
[2022-12-18 11:28:06] <%Synesh> If they price of Tw1 and Tw2 were around 20â¬, dlc range, and Warhammer 3 is the main game at full price. I would say save and go for it.
[2022-12-18 11:28:19] <%Iffiie> it's a expensive hobby apriSadge

[2022-12-18 11:28:43] <%Synesh> As for table top, there's a reason why people call Table Top "Plastic Crack"

[2022-12-18 11:30:03] <%$Memil03> The thing is no one really like the Realm of chaos canpaign so no new players are getting in to warhammer III..... thats why they need to make so u only need warhammer III to play mortal empire
[2022-12-18 11:30:13] <mysoulishate1> Im scared to destroy figures so i dont play tabletop and i dont want to make irl social contact because im an introvert so playing online on pc is perfect

[2022-12-18 11:31:03] <chaliceofpower> well i played realive game some times and well its rather hard to destry the figuriens while playing
[2022-12-18 11:31:06] <!Aaron_Kessinger> @mysoulishate1 you didn't hear it here but there might be some warhammer 40K mod for tabletop simulator so you can play with people far away :D

[2022-12-18 13:13:23] <!%$RickAltair> As she demands her troops to find the golden toaster, Cerise finds a bag of tengu tax next to her as if from thin air.  She looks around, but doesnât see the usual crow nor a note. Opening the bag, she is startled when that crow jumps out, gives her a head pat, then walks away while saying âsorry for rattling yaâ. Cerise pouts because the head pat was too comfy to get mad at his bad pun. Sheâs unfazed by him jumping out a bag 1/10 his size. Cheer100
[2022-12-18 13:13:23] <@%^StreamElements> RickAltair just cheered 100 bits PogChamp

[2022-12-18 13:20:55] <Rahsed> Yup, I remember when the show was starting he said he's in for easy 7 seasons or more if it's close to original
[2022-12-18 13:21:33] <Rahsed> But Master Chief got to clap those alien cheeks, surely that's worth it Kappa
[2022-12-18 13:21:35] <eilamos> haiyaa
[2022-12-18 13:21:36] <@%LT_Jakal> Netflix needs to stop ruining things, like trying to make all those live action anime titles
[2022-12-18 13:21:38] <%+JohnnyTightIips> All these shitty writers should make their own original work that everyone hates, instead of shitting on things everyone loves
[2022-12-18 13:21:41] <%+ashura422> pretty sure warchief was a much better spartan than whatever their "master chief" was

[2022-12-18 13:22:16] <%+Nashikage> @JohnnyTightIips that would require them to be original, and that requires TALENT.

[2022-12-18 13:23:45] <!%$RickAltair> They only type of anime that I though would make alright live action projects are slice-of-life anime.  Live action is better at focusing on drama than the shit shonen anime be having.
[2022-12-18 13:23:45] <+PvPk> its pretty far down the bottom line usually
[2022-12-18 13:23:47] <SteinerChannel> Hero Academia is "only" gonna be as bad as Death Note V:

[2022-12-18 13:24:13] <%GarmrUSAF> @JohnnyTightIips the ONLY way that can be ANY good is if they get Chris Judge as Kratos
[2022-12-18 13:24:15] <!%$RickAltair> Holy crap, I need to stop typing.  Apparently the typo demon has it out for me.
[2022-12-18 13:24:17] <Rahsed> Oh yeah we're also supposed to get a sequel to Death Note... somehow. How the hell did that warrant a sequel is beyond me

[2022-12-18 13:24:50] <%+JohnnyTightIips> @GarmrUSAF The games are already cinematic, so other than capitalising on the hype from the name, what's the poooint
[2022-12-18 13:24:57] <eilamos> distroy your reinforcement
[2022-12-18 13:25:01] <%GarmrUSAF> Chris Judge is the guy who voiced Kratos in the newer games..... also Teal'c from Stargate SG-1

[2022-12-18 13:52:35] <%+zarasque> @PersonaFreek01 Empire don't interact much with tomb king, it's very far and they have much to do by themselves, stories of skeletons in a far far away desert don't really concern them
[2022-12-18 13:52:43] <!%$RickAltair> He just wanted to be stepped on by the tengu queen.  I'm sure some in chat can relate. xD
