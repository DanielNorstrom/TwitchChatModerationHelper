[2022-12-19 07:11:56] <vrozeus> do u still do eff check for the cd increase?
[2022-12-19 07:11:59] <Rasiro_> I give her ice crystals so she's usually good at keeping someone alive along with her barrier. Locking down handguy or aravi is great when it works

[2022-12-19 07:15:06] <%+koryuk3n> I would be fine with it @Jenazad ...she is shit after turn 1 anyway. who cares about speed buff
[2022-12-19 07:15:07] <JoseHCC> remove s3
[2022-12-19 07:15:16] <SozNerfed> remove her clothes ok
[2022-12-19 07:15:20] <+DamnitsK_Lex> They won't remove Beguile because it's a unique Debuff @Jenazad
[2022-12-19 07:15:20] <Rasiro_> Spd buff is the only thing making lua op imo
[2022-12-19 07:15:22] <szyazel> UHM

[2022-12-19 07:15:36] <gregguluzian> i ungeared her since i perma ban her
[2022-12-19 07:15:37] <+KrysisKrow> remove ignores eff sb and extra turn on s2. and put extra turn sb on s2
[2022-12-19 07:15:40] <+DamnitsK_Lex> The speed buff is literally busted
[2022-12-19 07:15:41] <silvershadow737> she cycles pretty fast
[2022-12-19 07:15:42] <+fodolfoxp> yeah speed buff is really good
[2022-12-19 07:15:50] <%revdanny> AOL never had ignore Eff res
[2022-12-19 07:15:52] <+Viperfalcon> I think winter is really OP. 2 turn stun is great

[2022-12-19 07:16:09] <oni_tony> her tempo is crazy with spd buff
[2022-12-19 07:16:15] <%+Its_Lyken> she's so busted
[2022-12-19 07:16:17] <%Monika_AYAYA> she's the only non-attacker that can disable politis and a debuffer that can bypass handguy/delibet. this unit is absolutely retarded Madge

[2022-12-19 07:16:58] <Rasiro_> It's annoying that her s3 dispels not reduces by 1 turn. So even if she goes after your djb, she can still screw you

[2022-12-19 07:22:38] <%+koryuk3n> last season I used to cleave with Ran and not ban Sage by soulburning S3, which would fuck over Sage @Jenazad
[2022-12-19 07:22:38] <ajuicykaraage> @DamnitsK_Lex i run w.silk with sashe as well with laika, so if laika outspeeds its over for them
[2022-12-19 07:22:42] <kuan8200> should I buy the expedition pass?
[2022-12-19 07:22:51] <ItsAshTray> LOL

[2022-12-19 07:23:21] <ajuicykaraage> @DamnitsK_Lex for laika? she dont need it
[2022-12-19 07:23:30] <nguyenhungtan> but my ran suck LUL I only have best sp on him and nothing els
[2022-12-19 07:23:30] <inrealvlrt> what if I complete all the expedition rewards? is it still not worth for most people
[2022-12-19 07:23:30] <%TooCoolforaName> I stand by the fact that the two stupidest things in epic 7 is 15% and speed rng
[2022-12-19 07:23:30] <%+koryuk3n> yeah that was last season draft
[2022-12-19 07:23:31] <%boneymcboneman_> I hate regearing

[2022-12-19 07:23:37] <MysteIic> @Jenazad i've once lost to someone cuz their kayron had more hp than their AOLA so my straze s3 proc-d on kayron over AOLA
[2022-12-19 07:23:39] <ajuicykaraage> you build her eff in case you want to pivot to slower teams
[2022-12-19 07:23:42] <Laytens> @Jenazad why dont you complete your moonlight quests?

[2022-12-19 07:24:08] <ak_0w0> the expedition pass was worth it for me
[2022-12-19 07:24:08] <MysteIic> it was a 9k AOLA and a 12k kayron @Jenazad
[2022-12-19 07:24:11] <MysteIic> ICANT
[2022-12-19 07:24:17] <+DamnitsK_Lex> @ajuicykaraage ah so she's mainly there for the dual+ CC?

[2022-12-19 07:24:45] <%Romdeau> 3 boxes 3 molas
[2022-12-19 07:24:45] <ak_0w0> yes it saves you the annoying hunts and the wait
[2022-12-19 07:25:03] <+DamnitsK_Lex> Ehhhh

[2022-12-19 07:25:11] <HitomiBBG> not worth it
[2022-12-19 07:25:12] <%+koryuk3n> its kinda meh, i bought it once because I really need boxes
[2022-12-19 07:25:12] <+DamnitsK_Lex> IDK tbh
[2022-12-19 07:25:19] <ajuicykaraage> @DamnitsK_Lex to end on turn 1, its to dual atk. to play slower esp vs senya, its immu buff + sleep. or if you cant press any buttons its s1 push on the correct target hopefully
[2022-12-19 07:25:24] <%hinagikukatsurachan> the blue box
[2022-12-19 07:25:27] <ak_0w0> the reforge mats are the most worth
[2022-12-19 07:25:27] <Waaghbafet> should be 900 skystones ok
[2022-12-19 07:25:28] <!%PotatoesHUH> I only buy it when I'm desperate for transmit stones
[2022-12-19 07:25:29] <MysteIic> i only buy it when im low on manifestation stones @Jenazad
[2022-12-19 07:25:30] <%Romdeau> huche sells for 400
[2022-12-19 07:25:39] <+clemen84> molas at least 250 ss each
[2022-12-19 07:25:40] <nguyenhungtan> its not worth it LUL compare this to the actualy pass
[2022-12-19 07:25:44] <%TooCoolforaName> by that metric the boxes cover the cost entirely
[2022-12-19 07:25:53] <%keny_1994> is huche coming back before the year ends?
[2022-12-19 07:26:03] <%+IronTetsuo> I'm a dolphin so the expo pass is easily worth it imo.
[2022-12-19 07:26:05] <+DamnitsK_Lex> @ajuicykaraage Ahhh ok i think i get the jist of it
[2022-12-19 07:26:09] <predator1195> huche is coming

[2022-12-19 07:38:29] <acejohnson81> cleave nowadays has so many more hard counters/workarounds you need to be able to deal with compared to old generic cleaves
[2022-12-19 07:38:30] <ExDraconian> beginner cleave is a paradox
[2022-12-19 07:38:31] <pianorus> do you think is achievable a 1 shot banshee with destruction set? (for ram)

[2022-12-19 08:07:29] <+fodolfoxp> But I think you can do SOME impulsive pulls, like I pitied Sharun, she's not worth the pity but I did because I like the character and as long as I'm not doing it every single time it's actually easy to save for good RGB characters
[2022-12-19 08:07:29] <silvershadow737> they gotta have more than one balance team with one of them being brain damaged

[2022-12-19 09:31:00] <^Nightbot> I must confess I am guilty of abusing this very common bug known as ATywin SB S3 to get RTA legend. I am sorry to the legitimate non ATywin players out there. I saw an opportunity to create an unfair advantage for myself and I took it. I will accept the 90 day ban that Smilegate has handed out and hope fellow ATywin abusers reflect on their behavior. I hope next season I can qualify legitimately for Epic 7 World Cup without abusing ATywin.

[2022-12-19 12:05:41] <%TwoTurretsDeep> this game really takes off when u start hitting A3 on your units. they get a second color trait so they are activated by more tiles or they just get double their own color and do more dmg
