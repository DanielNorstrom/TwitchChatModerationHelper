[2023-01-06 17:49:16] <sandstonexray> So many big twitch streamers, especially women, are just trying to say the right things so they seem nice or virtuous. They will preach the virtues of feminism then blatantly sexually tease men and compromise intimacy with their partner. I like your stream because you are authentic.

[2023-01-06 18:26:39] <KaiZeEKing> you're mean
[2023-01-06 18:26:42] <%Oretobar> those games are basically using the same principles as a slot machine to get people addicted and spent a ton of money, so there's a reason they are hated
[2023-01-06 18:27:04] <+NewbAceFace> funny when people eat my big sushi snake lmao
[2023-01-06 18:27:04] <%Svinto85> those are mostly the free games tho there are game you buy to play

[2023-01-06 20:29:39] <michaelesteve> ambulances arrived on the scene escorted by military convoys of special detainment units. reinforced armoured personnel carriers modified with sound deadening clay were used to evacuate those who were present in the library. my screams had caused no permanent injuries to the victims but they remembered the screams until the end of their days. with military assistance all workers, patrons and children were removed from the area most affected by my screams and it seemed the crisis was over

[2023-01-06 20:30:28] <@%NobodyPepe> At this point its not about the library anymore

[2023-01-06 20:32:24] <michaelesteve> however my screamed remained. at this point the ground was rumbling, only a miracle kept the library from collapse. there seemed to be no end to the screams, they had blended together into a vile cacophony of unholy vibration which permeated reason and idea its self.

[2023-01-06 20:40:28] <michaelesteve> the passage of time appeared to cease. there existed only the screams and only the consciousness of those who witnessed it. during this passage of time my screams brought to life a hero. a divine saviour to end the screams. an avatar of a Greater Being sent to save the sanctity of libraries across the realm of the living. this Entity approached me, unperturbed by my screams. he walked up and uttered the words that would go on to define this age
