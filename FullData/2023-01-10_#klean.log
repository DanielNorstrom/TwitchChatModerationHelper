[2023-01-10 00:00:21] <%Navaid_> what do you mean meta ammo is gone?

[2023-01-10 00:00:47] <%+kevsabot> @BingBongMcgee yep
[2023-01-10 00:00:51] <MOneyJuiceDaddy> @kennysexman there is just something with Lighthouse tho, having this new 100% spawnrate boss so strong that only hackers can kill
[2023-01-10 00:00:52] <raxier11> See a Mfer running across woods with a taiga one hitting trees over @kevsabot

[2023-01-10 00:00:59] <%+ZachBern> what do you think of bsg throttling the progression, for example level caps per week. only like 10 per irl week
[2023-01-10 00:01:06] <+xzmouse> i think usec should have bonuses for nato weapons and bear with aks etc
[2023-01-10 00:01:13] <@%SamuraiSavv> @KrackinWise313 Hey, all i did was say who wears a cape

[2023-01-10 00:03:34] <+syphon_ac007> what about being able to heal other players, that way not everyone has to carry the same meds
[2023-01-10 00:03:34] <%+xDeltrix> that scope is so klean with the FOV trick

[2023-01-10 00:05:00] <Lefty831> @gitlythebear rarest item in game is a scav gamma. It’s a Fanny pack thing
[2023-01-10 00:05:03] <+GitlytheBear> But only if u get max scav rep

[2023-01-10 00:05:29] <Lefty831> Yep. Can only pick it up as a scav
[2023-01-10 00:05:30] <+ComaHVC> @Lefty831 would it not be the alpha arm band?
[2023-01-10 00:05:33] <0_FREEZER_0> Is there not limb pen in this?
[2023-01-10 00:05:41] <%+zerodark_met> that was so fuckin funny tho

[2023-01-10 00:06:17] <BingBongMcgee> too many things are client side that shouldn't be. sometimes my screenshows blood on the floor when sniper scav misses me and i don't get hit

[2023-01-10 14:18:24] <+GreenCactus57> the change for ammo is nice ! For the 1% of player its sucks ok. but for people that play like me 2-3 hours a day the change is nice ! but at the end of the day positioning is key is this game imo

[2023-01-10 14:19:03] <%5cavlive5matt3r> The ammo changes are fine. The key changes for quests, I don't agree with. 5/5 uses would be acceptable.

[2023-01-10 14:20:42] <%5cavlive5matt3r> I think the changes are a good stop-gap until they make traders in-raid.

[2023-01-10 14:21:24] <$crslk> finding good ammo in raid is actually rewarding too

[2023-01-10 14:22:42] <+GrimmStoneJones> lol I have never completed been able to buy BP. I've always crafted and still had a massive amount.
[2023-01-10 14:22:42] <glappie> I'm tired of pretending this game isnt setup to keep streamers entertained longer for longer exposure. I enjoy myself tremendously in SPTarkov. But BSG have the worst servers and keep messing up the basics (AI, sound, code).....
[2023-01-10 14:22:50] <bgdnbo> you haven't lost anything
[2023-01-10 14:22:50] <+UnDeNiEd2G> People are negative about everything not just Tarkov its just peoples way of life honestly
[2023-01-10 14:22:53] <kanesdeath1212> well to be fair. the game hasnt really improved in the past five years.
[2023-01-10 14:22:53] <%+MajorJakov> everyone wants the game to be made their own way, not the way BSG envisions the game.
[2023-01-10 14:22:53] <TempestSolo> What exactly happened to the ammo? I'm not in the loop lately
[2023-01-10 14:22:53] <stellarb> Saltiest subreddit LULW

[2023-01-10 14:23:07] <keymanog> thats the culture on everything this days
[2023-01-10 14:23:07] <R1ppCaTT> Most people bitching about this are just gonna be arena chads anyway so whats it matter
[2023-01-10 14:23:10] <+bakesaucee> @glappie ^^
[2023-01-10 14:23:10] <+sharkazoid> The thing is... Assholes are louder than regular players, that's why you only hear negativity
[2023-01-10 14:23:12] <+Fateless907> idk why but i check bsg facebook posts when im scrollin thru and its always ppl complaining
[2023-01-10 14:23:12] <+furiouss1> @kanesdeath1212 for real? :D did you played 5 years ago?
[2023-01-10 14:23:15] <DiscocharlieE> some peoplle treat this game as if it was their fucking life and they dont even stream
[2023-01-10 14:23:19] <+jj700physics> which hotkey are you using?
[2023-01-10 14:23:37] <%+TrueReduxx> it's like when they added the healing animations. the pvp Chad's got real upset thinking it'd never come kekw
[2023-01-10 14:23:37] <+thecollegetry> I don’t play this game, can I still go on social media and complain? LUL
[2023-01-10 14:23:42] <MoreDakka> doesn't snap the view back to center?
[2023-01-10 14:23:51] <%5cavlive5matt3r> @R1ppCaTT I mean ammo doesn't bother me. Stock recoil is trash and could use a buff KEKW
[2023-01-10 14:23:55] <+furiouss1> @kanesdeath1212 5 years ago, you only had 20 quests and a short part of woods, customs and shoreline :D
[2023-01-10 14:23:55] <+RebelFoxtrot> I think comments on the internet can just seem loud. Because the people that enjoy the game aren't commenting.
[2023-01-10 14:24:18] <glappie> EFT is becoming a scam. Even star citizen will release a 1.0 before BSG. Meanwhile Nikita is filling his pockets with millions.  I want this game to succeed, but the game hasnt really improved the basics (AI, servers, performance....)
[2023-01-10 14:24:18] <stellarb> There was a post on the tarkov sub about suggesting BSG to sell the game to another company LULW

[2023-01-10 14:24:32] <%5cavlive5matt3r> @RebelFoxtrot Northing wrong with commentary, just whether its constructive.
[2023-01-10 14:24:32] <%+Ramboness> But could there be people who complain that also enjoy the game but just want it to be better after 6 years?
[2023-01-10 14:24:32] <glappie> @stellarb if it has competent programmers, why not?
[2023-01-10 14:24:32] <KnobsOut> Man I died to killa right here on a good raid. He was fully hidden in the shadows until he started blastin LUL
[2023-01-10 14:24:53] <%+oATLANTICo> I feel like tarkov steamers breed the negativity as well not talking about you just in general
[2023-01-10 14:24:57] <@%+fortburke> @glappie I think calling it a scam is going a bit too far
[2023-01-10 14:25:02] <CJ_the_Fox> @glappie it has though. I don't know how long you've played, but I've played since before 2017. It's improved substantially
[2023-01-10 14:25:02] <DiscocharlieE> obviously people are allowed to complain, but when was the last time people collectively have given constructive criticism without also being extremely condescending
[2023-01-10 14:25:04] <%5cavlive5matt3r> I can see why the flashlights could use a nerf.
[2023-01-10 14:25:04] <DunDidItNow> Audio under interchange is funky. You probably heard people above you
[2023-01-10 14:25:09] <DeathDeclined> flashlights where not this bright last wipe correct ?
[2023-01-10 14:25:20] <R1ppCaTT> @5cavlive5matt3r ohhh for sure, nothing like shooting the sky after the first 2 rounds popped off KEKW
[2023-01-10 14:25:28] <glappie> @fortburke couldnt find the correct word for it :) sorry
[2023-01-10 14:25:28] <r3ap3rth3p33p3r> has the audio been messing with anyone else where youll hear someone right next to you and they are a mile away
[2023-01-10 14:25:48] <DocReverb> did they reduce the fog on interchange this wipe?
[2023-01-10 14:25:48] <%+Ramboness> There's plenty of constructive critiques of game without being condecending..
[2023-01-10 14:26:05] <@%+fortburke> @glappie You're good bro just wanna help you articulate your point\
[2023-01-10 14:26:11] <%5cavlive5matt3r> @fortburke Scam? No. Do I think the devs overestimated the difficulties in creating the project? Yes.
[2023-01-10 14:26:22] VIEWERS: 646
[2023-01-10 14:26:27] <stellarb> Tarkov has 10x as much content as other games that cost $40
[2023-01-10 14:26:44] <glappie> @glappie but really, has it in the last 2 years? I keep going to this game and dropping it after the same server and fps issues persist (this time there is also Audio and AI issues)
[2023-01-10 14:26:50] <DiscocharlieE> i really hope BSG considers the ADS FOV thing as an actual feature
[2023-01-10 14:26:50] <@%+fortburke> Also yea the game has changed a lot the past 5 years I have played it
[2023-01-10 14:26:56] <bennyblob> does anyone know how to get his settings without bugging him?

[2023-01-10 14:31:13] <%+Ramboness> @fortburke it would probably be showered in negative reviews
[2023-01-10 14:31:26] <castortroyit> why toolset are so expensive in flea?
[2023-01-10 14:31:46] <%+tyirshkid> @glappie my only issue with SPTarkov is it isn't as exciting or funny as true online play, previously when I played a bunch I would go "normal" over it you know?

[2023-01-10 14:32:25] <+aggro1games> because toolsets are always good loot, and needed for most things in the stash, even later on
[2023-01-10 14:32:34] <+asoupsandwich> ooh interchange. my favorite map
[2023-01-10 14:32:34] <glappie> @glappie i get that :)
[2023-01-10 14:32:45] <+asoupsandwich> wish they didn't butcher it with the audio
[2023-01-10 14:33:16] <KnobsOut> while I like the fact that it doesn't mess with your FOV like this, I kinda hate how much smaller the lense of the optics become... But I'm also a habitual freelook user so I guess its all academic LUL
[2023-01-10 14:34:06] <@%+fortburke> The wining puts Tarkov in a bad light to anyone who doesn't play but it is still such a unique experience that does deserve a ton of praise as well as criticism
[2023-01-10 14:34:06] <+vdubk9_> i dont play eft but i do watch it every so often i was wondering why they took away the ammo from traders

[2023-01-10 14:35:58] <glappie> @fortburke the only gripe i have is that BSG constantly ignores the feedback. there is 0 communication towards the community. Audio hasnt been adressed, no comment on servers, no comment on all issues....

[2023-01-10 14:37:10] <%+tyirshkid> @glappie Idk if I would say they ignore the feedback, I think they are trying to bridge the gap between feedback and their intended development goal.
[2023-01-10 14:37:19] <+furiouss1> why should they open to such a toxic community?

[2023-01-10 14:38:54] <%5cavlive5matt3r> It caused him to quit Sadge
[2023-01-10 14:39:27] <+asoupsandwich> idk there are also people out there that spend more time than the biggest streamers in tarkov. I killed a lvl 43 last night named 311, don't believe theyre a streamer
[2023-01-10 14:39:32] <%+Ramboness> @5cavlive5matt3r noice quit tarkov?

[2023-01-10 14:41:00] <r3ap3rth3p33p3r> will they be adding that fov glitch as a feature because its so good

[2023-01-10 14:42:17] <+vdubk9_> did they increase the spawn rate of bp and other ammo in raids
[2023-01-10 14:42:17] <%Braydingle> @Klean have they said anything about adding a ads fov slider at all?

[2023-01-10 14:42:35] <%+tyirshkid> Might be a hot take, but the community around tarkov "seems" to be more aggressive (maybe persistent is the better word here) about talking to the devs about perceived (or real) problems.

[2023-01-10 14:49:11] <+krazyk928> using the word 'realistic' is about the easiest way to explain this game to bystanders
[2023-01-10 14:49:11] <gman23132> @KevinSredz They still would've cried sure but not to this level
[2023-01-10 14:49:16] <RANcID3> For me, a filthy casual, removing ammo is fine, but the level grind is getting a little hard unlocking hideout. But, the mag dumping in order to kill fusing slightly different round is what's killing the game for me.
[2023-01-10 14:49:16] <xToXni> I like poop
[2023-01-10 14:49:17] <+KometenKai> maybe getting a buff, after pooping in the hideout

[2023-01-10 14:50:55] <gman23132> @KevinSredz I think the majority of people that play the game are crybabies because alot of the issues that have been in the game for years still haven't been addressed. Adds more and more anger to a community that already plays an aggravating game. Audio is still bugged to hell and I actually doubt we will get any sort of patch for it this wipe.

[2023-01-10 14:55:18] <%+Ramboness> @gman23132 I think it will take a long time of them to fix it, I mean they couldn't get steam audio right in the first place, and since this a a new implementation I DOUBT they will have it down to the buttom in the next few months

[2023-01-10 15:06:40] <gman23132> The community would be less pissed off about cheaters and the audio and a whole other slew of issues if bsg actually addressed these issues and say that they will work on fixing them. No developer communication is awful and just makes the community paranoid

[2023-01-10 15:16:45] <+Sugabuga87> literally doesn't effect anyone, its not like anyone had all that meta ammo anyway
[2023-01-10 15:16:46] <%Swako21> @HarukiYumi helped me realize that running better gear makes you much more difficult to kill
[2023-01-10 15:16:46] <+chaddad_ttv> hit filling cabnits!!!!
[2023-01-10 15:16:49] <xToXni> 10 days into wipe: "but bro i dont have BP ammo omg"

[2023-01-10 15:16:49] <%Timboto> @HarukiYumi I just realized one day that I was sweating over literal pixels is all and then my gear fear went away.
[2023-01-10 15:16:49] <+gurenwhisper> All games that have wipes or season give FOMO. Not sure FOMO is an entirely bad thing tho
[2023-01-10 15:16:53] <%ONExALPHAx9ER> @jmac8675309 I feel that lol

[2023-01-10 15:17:35] <givemespitfire> @mentario20 You wont be able to keep the loot. You can only keep loot from online raids. But its good way to practice and get used to healing, shooting, exploring, etc.
[2023-01-10 15:17:35] <%+panzergorilla23> watching new people get mad in chat when your not affraid to speak your mind is so funny
[2023-01-10 15:17:50] <%PinkGuy_120> oh wow
[2023-01-10 15:17:59] <+MrFloomp> @HarukiYumi Start the wipe and be so aggressive that you die every raid. Do that for a few days or weeks. Then, reset your account.
[2023-01-10 15:18:09] <Browsk1> would u ever fight again?

[2023-01-10 15:24:39] <RitzoTakeda> Big question.  Are the cost for studio headphones worth it for playing games?  I see Pest running 1990 pros, ninja doing the same.  I see you're also running studios.  Is it a big game canger and worth it for the sound quality?

[2023-01-10 15:26:27] <RitzoTakeda> @joshgav I get it's their job, but my thing is the cost for them worth it if you have the money?  Or would it be just as viable with a cheaper "gaming" headset

[2023-01-10 15:32:06] <%+TaBoaConstrictrR> @RitzoTakeda id say when youre listening to music its really noticable. lot more depth and the sound stage can be really cool. it depends on what headphones you get cause theyre all different. even if you get something thats in the same brand. moving up from gaming headsets will always be better for the overall experience but again wont really give you a much of a step up in gaming performance
[2023-01-10 15:32:12] <%potatosacman> Are anime’s mostly for entertainment like fictional movies?

[2023-01-10 15:36:09] <%+TaBoaConstrictrR> @RitzoTakeda thats a huge investment if you can get to a music store that has those kinds of headphones to demo id check that out first. the 1990's have a slight boost to bass and treble but not as much of a bass boost like gaming headphones have. what you will notice is the depth of the bass. hard to explain unless youve actually heard it

[2023-01-10 15:46:12] <Rappy_88> To me, Battlefied 2 will always remain as "the" battlefield
[2023-01-10 15:46:13] <+RebelFoxtrot> Agreed. It had a cool feel to it.
[2023-01-10 15:46:19] <g0d_like999> Hey @Klean  I have a video a a blaitant cheater plus his name what can i do to get this guy banned other then pressing repport and hope for the best? Since the manual reporting button is not a thing in the launcher anymore.
[2023-01-10 15:46:21] <shakey3377> Hardlines was criminally underrated
[2023-01-10 15:46:21] <deadlydayne> hardline was my favorite.  it was amazing, didnt deserve teh bad rep it got
[2023-01-10 15:46:26] <Thuum> hardline was fun had cool easter eggs too
[2023-01-10 15:46:27] <+Ultra_Sur76> Hardline very underappreciated....but the hardcore BF fans didn't want ot give it a chance.

[2023-01-10 16:02:16] <ballisticvisions> They need to patch that fov fix in the game than.

[2023-01-10 16:24:13] <bgdnbo> is there any intent for BSG devs to add a loadout screen where you can turn options on and off like in stalker anomaly, for hardcore playthroughs? Have they ever talked about that?

[2023-01-10 16:25:22] <+dhyne_> bc its tarkov not stalker anomaly LUL  @bgdnbo
[2023-01-10 16:25:24] <kadeniwnl> @DeathlokTheDemolisher Do you think its best for now to keep binaural off or do the pros outweigh the cons

[2023-01-10 16:26:01] <+RebelFoxtrot> Im playing Gamma right now. First Stalker experience. Im in love.
[2023-01-10 16:26:03] <+SaturniLuna> i tried anomaly and i just could not understand the mechanics. i need to watch a vid
[2023-01-10 16:26:06] <+JMacC_876> you have been preaching this for years @klean  I am hoping for more changes to gear and guns
[2023-01-10 16:26:08] <xJustPayBacKx> @bgdnbo Well for one you would have to have separate servers for hardcore and regular. It also takes away from the core survival of everyone fighting together
[2023-01-10 16:26:10] <+dhyne_> @dertysprite its all the gear shifting around
[2023-01-10 16:26:11] <bgdnbo> @dhyne_ It's a menu option, has nothing to do with the game it slef
[2023-01-10 16:26:15] <%PinkGuy_120> man, I tried the miracle machine a few days ago and I didnt get too far and shit myself way too many times
[2023-01-10 16:26:17] <DeathlokTheDemolisher> @DeathlokTheDemolisher @kadeniwnl idk to be honest lol the sound is so messed up either way
[2023-01-10 16:26:33] <PR3TENDr> i love it when i play in a duo and a scav aggros on one of us, so we hit the deck and the other one kills the scav
[2023-01-10 16:26:41] <%dertysprite> @dertysprite yeah it just kinda throws me off sometimes cause i can't figure out what the sound is

[2023-01-10 16:26:54] <%dertysprite> like what gear would cause this sound when moving? lol

[2023-01-10 16:46:39] <+kylewirgaming> What's the worse thing getting shot at by ai scav's? big woop

[2023-01-10 16:46:46] <%PinkGuy_120> @samuel_o34 well
[2023-01-10 16:46:47] <de_charny> @kylewirgaming I think it is fine as is. Its about balancing incentives. There should be risk as a player Scav from other scavs. Scavs are oppertunistic. For being a traitor the pro is the better loot the con is the karma hit and longer wait times.
[2023-01-10 16:46:50] <TheWalkingG> @PinkGuy_120 one thing my buddy does is he'll have ADS as toggle, and then hold breath on the release of right click. so once he goes ADS he's holding his breath

[2023-01-10 16:48:07] <+kylewirgaming> @kylewirgaming Dont make sense in lore as Fence leads Scavs brother hood he's the pimp they dont betray each other so if they want to take the risk for the loot they should lose that ablity again It's not punishing enough worse thing that happens to you is AI scavs kill you when as a scav. Big woop they killed you before whats to stop them killing them again?
[2023-01-10 16:48:08] <%PinkGuy_120> @rs10rs10 yeah, its offline mode

[2023-01-10 16:49:26] <+kylewirgaming> Like i said i think a fitting punishment once -negative thing is you lose the ablity to be a scav and soon as you kill one all items in raid for you turn Not FIR and you have to do Co-op extrects to earn that trust back as a PMC

[2023-01-10 16:51:55] <de_charny> @kylewirgaming That is way too harsh. so someone accidentally kills a scav as a scav and cannot scav again until coop extract. which rarely happens.
[2023-01-10 16:51:55] <%+Flookiee> can get way more reps in. more gun fights
[2023-01-10 16:52:00] <+poon_ninja> will it simulate the lag on streets?

[2023-01-10 16:56:32] <+gtrnut2112> Yo! Whats the consensus on budget builds at this stage? I have been getting destroyed in raids!
[2023-01-10 16:56:32] <+Giga_Civilian> Good perspective
[2023-01-10 16:56:34] <Brewsky26> I want to redeploy as a scav, drop gear off on extract but redeploy the scav as pmc
[2023-01-10 16:56:47] <annual_anteater> will you use the gear from your stash in the arena?
[2023-01-10 16:56:50] <llama4444> Cant wait for my great grandkids to play arena with me :)
[2023-01-10 16:56:50] <%+Flookiee> good way to try out new weapons I think
[2023-01-10 16:56:53] <%LiquidTell> think about a bad raid over the load time phase
[2023-01-10 16:56:53] <jAmzye> at this point I dont give a fuck, just make the gamepaly loop different and iam all on
[2023-01-10 16:56:53] <de_charny> @kylewirgaming There is a difference between being challenging and over the top punishing just for the sake of being punishing. Removing the ability to scav at all just for going negative once and having the only way to get it back an extremely rare occurrence (coop extract) is too much.
[2023-01-10 16:56:56] <LabMade> its all around huge for the community and game, cant wait

[2023-01-10 16:57:05] <grumpygr1ngo> its gunna be interesting to see how the player base spread out between arena and raids
[2023-01-10 16:57:09] <%Saro4president> Atm priority and absolute one is audio fix and desync fix on street
[2023-01-10 16:57:38] <+Jameloaf> gameplay loop sounds fun in arena. i just wanna get in and shoot. 15min load times are kinda a buzz kill
[2023-01-10 16:57:40] <+la_vieille_reguine> are you using surround sound in your headset to play games like this?
[2023-01-10 16:57:57] <rs10rs10> audio in this game is top tier?
[2023-01-10 16:58:49] <+kylewirgaming> @kylewirgaming It's not that hard just VOIP my dude lol. there is no reason to kill another scav
[2023-01-10 16:58:58] <Hardrada> when it works correctly

[2023-01-10 16:59:01] <%its_matija> i wana play the game soo badly but the audio just completly ruins it for me
[2023-01-10 16:59:01] <BeatOramA> @rs10rs10 far from it actually
[2023-01-10 16:59:01] <grumpygr1ngo> @rs10rs10 Kappa
[2023-01-10 16:59:18] <%+Flookiee> @rs10rs10 directional sound is currently broken
[2023-01-10 16:59:23] <GunnerGunnerson> id be less scared with better sound
[2023-01-10 16:59:23] <%+GWoo42> Hopefully they are working on a patch for the audio
[2023-01-10 16:59:28] <bgdnbo> first they need to make it work then need to make more diverse
[2023-01-10 17:00:23] <DeathlokTheDemolisher> exactly
[2023-01-10 17:00:40] <+AmeriMexi> the audio kinda killed my drive for this wipe
[2023-01-10 17:00:58] <Painwaltz> sequisha set his windows audio to spacial from microsoft and seems to be going ok for him. dts not as good he said
[2023-01-10 17:00:58] <%stealthyhazboola> audio above all else for the upcoming wipe
[2023-01-10 17:00:58] <ugongetthiswork> if the sound was better I prolly wouldnt want to escape from tarkov
[2023-01-10 17:00:58] <+slid3r09> @klean good morning to you and chat

[2023-01-10 17:01:04] <+kylewirgaming> You're job as a scav is get loot and get out like a flithy vulture takeing the flesh off of body's and leave that's it you betray the trust of other vultures you are removed from the pack
[2023-01-10 17:01:04] <%anoscura> they should remove foot steps sounds unless they are in the same room as you
[2023-01-10 17:01:04] <DeathlokTheDemolisher> @AmeriMexi same
[2023-01-10 17:01:14] <rs10rs10> hmm, but it is so asmr
[2023-01-10 17:01:22] <MindRUsh_> Imagine actually hearing whats happening in the game KEKW
[2023-01-10 17:01:38] <Noticegiven> it got me. Im playing other games while I wait.
[2023-01-10 17:01:51] <NisseA> Watched your video on ammo changes. Always loved your takes on the game through out the years! keep the good work going mate!
[2023-01-10 17:01:51] <sebrebacitta> just imagine how many people tried tarkov this patch and never wanna come back because they can't hear where people actuallly are
[2023-01-10 17:01:51] <%PinkGuy_120> imagine playing with sound on
[2023-01-10 17:02:01] <%PinkGuy_120> sound enjoyers smh

[2023-01-10 17:02:18] <%+Flookiee> playing flatter maps like woods isnt too bad. can still hear too far away though
[2023-01-10 17:02:24] <+AmeriMexi> i love tarkov, i can wait for them to improve
[2023-01-10 17:02:24] <%joshgav> Ive had this cpu for like 6 years lmao
[2023-01-10 17:02:32] <MindRUsh_> @PinkGuy_120 True
[2023-01-10 17:02:38] <+stokers93> not to mention no stealth at all now
[2023-01-10 17:02:47] <%RagingLoony> I think its a little off that BSG themselves haven't said anything or aknowledged the problems, its been almost two weeks :(
[2023-01-10 17:02:55] <%PinkGuy_120> I just hit mute
[2023-01-10 17:02:55] <+Giga_Civilian> Seems crazy that they cant hire a team to fix the audio. So so important ;-;

[2023-01-10 17:25:26] <InnererKonflikt> @rottendeadite the only hurdle to me, is character models and gun models. the single only thing that makes it roblox like.
[2023-01-10 17:25:34] <+FatherOwens> @Klean can u still find the "meta" ammo in raid?

[2023-01-10 17:25:49] <%+picklemickkk> What I appreciate about the battlebit development is their dedication to making sure the experience is as smooth as possible for a multiplayer game. Just shows if you take the time to properly test your game AAA or not the people will follow you.
[2023-01-10 17:25:52] <+FatherOwens> @cubezgg damn thats so badass.
[2023-01-10 17:25:53] <%PinkGuy_120> 120 pack of T ammo is considered a sausage, right? right?
[2023-01-10 17:25:54] <+rottendeadite> @InnererKonflikt Yeah I don't mind the world art that much either. But big rectangular hands is tough to get past.

[2023-01-10 17:55:22] <+hellsaero_gg> @Klean So I love the 7.62x51 dmr gun but now that m80 is locked under lvl4 trader what ammo do you recommend to use? When I don't have any and have not found some? Or should I really invest into the hideout and craft ammo
[2023-01-10 17:55:25] <%KevinSredz> @Plantainboeh28 RPD and m249 arent battle rifle caliber :v
[2023-01-10 17:55:30] <%+DraX_Core> @LowerNape yea
[2023-01-10 17:55:33] <de_charny> Tbh I think that the belt feds are going to be underwhelming until they rework the recoil system. short bursts wont work from the belt fed lmgs because of how the recoil increases after the first shot

[2023-01-10 17:57:12] <HanksAdventures> love the ammo changes, wonderful stuff

[2023-01-10 17:57:48] <LowerNape> @DraX_Core the eye adjustment from far to close FOV with a sight sometimes messes with me, i might go check out that video
[2023-01-10 17:58:00] <rJarrr> I'd love to see the DP-27, but I doubt they'll but it in, many other LMGs should be added before it

[2023-01-10 17:58:34] <de_charny> @de_charny even then with the meta of the game being displacement, I dont think that holding a fixed firing position will be all that useful. There is no good way to model suppression 1:1 in a game because IRL you get hit you might die. The self-preservation instinct just isnt as strong in a videogame

[2023-01-10 17:59:31] <+barcode_i> @de_charny I agree. No matter what is done the game is unrealistic. it's still a game even though they try to call it a simulation.
[2023-01-10 17:59:39] <%+picklemickkk> Veritas always complains how it never makes sense you lose stamina when you get shot when in reality you should get a 5-10 second boost in stamina to reposition @Klean

[2023-01-10 18:19:43] <@%+cubezgg> @rhythmicirl I think its under 95 durability guns have a chance to malfunction

[2023-01-10 18:19:59] <@%+cubezgg> the lower the durability the higher the malfunction chance
[2023-01-10 18:20:01] <nohoth> I'm so confused everyone is saying how this ammo change hurts the casual player, but I don't know what everyone defines as a casual player and if 90% of the players you face are "casual" or 10%are.
[2023-01-10 18:20:56] <firstworld> im baffled by how many streamers are crying on twitter by the ammo changes
[2023-01-10 18:21:07] <JohnSoulz> @nohoth its not confusing, casuals will be using ps ammo while grinders already buying m80 from lvl4 traders

[2023-01-10 18:22:44] <nohoth> @johnsoulz so what percentage are casual. because if 98%of the playerbase is below level 37 that means only 1 out of 37 fights(roughly) you'd be against someone outclassing you
[2023-01-10 18:22:44] <+Jawln> @Klean can you buy M80 still i thought that was removed from traders?

[2023-01-10 18:26:00] <%filthy_franco69> @nohoth for me I dont mind dying; because I learn from every pvp fight; I cant take the amount of cheating I keep running into. Bring a decent kit in and it's instant head eyes on spawn
[2023-01-10 18:26:20] <JohnSoulz> @KevinSredz There is no so, i am answering his question, please check out the context before "so"ing me
[2023-01-10 18:26:25] <maverick_666_> @Klean yea but flea market is based on the players economy and trades are fixed
[2023-01-10 18:26:40] <@%+cubezgg> @nohoth That's great and everything, but EFT was not made to be fair and is a game where playing more does give you an advantage; this is due to the RPG type element that BSG is going for

[2023-01-10 18:37:44] <%Deezil_Wood> Woods is generally underrated for loot.  I've been finding tons of good ammo at the scav shack / attachment cabin.  Most of the hidden stashes aren't looted.
[2023-01-10 18:37:48] <%PinkGuy_120> KEKW

[2023-01-10 18:38:20] <+siriusaltaisandromeda> @arctichusky thanks, yeah im left to blind running my own little loot path on light house for money. I'd just like to be able to pvp more instead of ratting.
[2023-01-10 18:38:20] <JackalsGekko> @rolek_ Grelsh go to factory, rince and repeat until you get them :)
[2023-01-10 18:38:25] <LowerNape> oh yeah, touch that wood
[2023-01-10 18:38:41] <Zunae> Did they remove shturman?
[2023-01-10 18:38:41] <+Barleypopboy> now good ammo does that to my monkey brain too when FIR.

[2023-01-10 18:38:47] <%stealthyhazboola> cheaters gonna cheat, do what you love
[2023-01-10 18:38:52] <+LGRT_RL> @jackalsgekko whenever I get low in money, I scav in and cache run woods. People miss so many of them and I normally make about a mil or so.

[2023-01-10 18:55:56] <sorerichard919> They're moving ammo and good scopes to Lightkeeper. that's my working theory.
[2023-01-10 18:56:07] <dgravel24> any reason for the shrimp over other handguns?

[2023-01-10 18:56:43] <%TSvassilev> shrimp is just a clean gun. I like the sights
[2023-01-10 18:56:53] <%+WizzerOne> I hope they stick to these ammo changes for the entire wipe and dont revert them

[2023-01-10 19:01:40] <+Watts24fps> yeah cod has pretty good animations too

[2023-01-10 19:02:22] <+JadeWISDOM> I mean the fact we still cant buy a loadout preset is just so sad
[2023-01-10 19:02:30] <hightierdog> cod relies heavily on photogrammetry but still chooses to be arcade

[2023-01-10 19:02:40] <+JadeWISDOM> But I guess thats hardcore
[2023-01-10 19:02:49] <%+GL0CKenspeil> The thing I can’t stand with cod is the axial movement of the gun when you shoot it moves like 3” forward and back KEKW

[2023-01-10 19:23:22] <de_charny> @filthy_franco69 honestly think that the devs are going to need to take a reality check with open world. I think the best we get is linked raids where you "extract" into another map

[2023-01-10 20:04:08] <+mcpw> Zeroing at 100 with Irons for a shot 10-15 meters away is not going to change point of impact above a head
[2023-01-10 20:04:19] <+mcpw> so drastic that it doesnt touch

[2023-01-10 20:20:04] <szu_the_snake> SVD is the only DMR that is as it should be. Low ergo but SLAPS your shit if it hits you.

[2023-01-10 20:20:54] <Chamagoiaba> @Klean You think there's any 54r guns that could be added that would be meta, wouldn't most 54r guns be heavy and bad ergo?
[2023-01-10 20:20:58] <+jester435> bolties are super accurate as well, so that first shot hits. MOA does matter
[2023-01-10 20:21:15] <callsignwarhound> SVT
[2023-01-10 20:21:19] <sostarkov> Does anyone know why the magpul moe fde pistol grip is trading for San tape and stuff like that but the black one is only 10k or so
[2023-01-10 20:21:33] <callsignwarhound> Saiga has a 54r rifle
[2023-01-10 20:21:36] <%KevinSredz> @sostarkov gunsmith task maybe
[2023-01-10 20:21:48] <%potatosacman> Bolties are not too good for 2 reasons: 1. Ranges in this game extend to 400 meters max usually. 2. People can heal very quick in the game. Follow up shots are crucial to kill someone before they heal up. Makes body shots a bit weak with bolties.
[2023-01-10 20:21:49] <@%+cubezgg> @sostarkov its part of a gunsmith quest and you can't buy it from traders
[2023-01-10 20:22:06] <Chamagoiaba> TY for the examples, actually completely forgot about all those LUL

[2023-01-10 20:38:17] <+GettinRekt_> Dead ass BSG needs to stop posting on their Twitter/Facebook about events when the map the "took 4 years to develop" rubber bands for the first 25 minutes and runs in 60fps
[2023-01-10 20:38:21] <Cyanon_gK> So true.... Im glad BSG doesnt listen to the BS and the noise and stick to their vision.

[2023-01-10 20:39:37] <+GettinRekt_> @Venin98 Worst thing to complain about cheats are $3/day and is a problem in every Multiplayer game that has existed. There were hackers in CoD 2 (2004) you gotta just accept them

[2023-01-10 20:42:44] <+THEFLAKEsenpai> i can understand why people are complaining about the mem leak and packet loss and rubber banding.  but that shit takes time to fix.  they cant snap their fingers and its done.   theyll get it done cause they know if they dont its money going down the drain.  especially with how the EFT community is

[2023-01-10 20:45:45] <%+Arduin_> @klean it is a server issue, if you go into an offline raid you won’t experience that
[2023-01-10 20:45:49] <+THEFLAKEsenpai> hopefully they narrow down the issue and get it fixed by end of the week

[2023-01-10 23:00:46] <p_jilla> I loathe ears in this game.
[2023-01-10 23:00:48] <3uttmancer> guns should just deafen you a bit if you fire a lot, comtacs should keep them from doing that
[2023-01-10 23:00:52] <justcarbunkle> i honestly dont use them, it makes it hard to hear
[2023-01-10 23:00:53] <+Zezzku> Sheesh those comtacs go for 1200 IRL

[2023-01-10 23:01:26] <+Thaulus> I dont mind headset being unrealistically powerfull. This is game over all and headsets are another investment in your gear power

[2023-01-10 23:01:40] <StrungFX> That was weird sounded like first but they still on 2nd
[2023-01-10 23:01:54] <%+Stang9663> unless you are stomping around you dont really hear them
[2023-01-10 23:02:01] <dmitrybeard> imagine visiting a house. i prefer outside Kappa
[2023-01-10 23:02:07] <+SeperateAdvance> I used comtacs in the Royal Marines, they are super powerful but in the game they are broken as heck
[2023-01-10 23:02:07] <magicznykij> muffled?

[2023-01-10 23:02:22] <krion84> it needs to sound muffled
[2023-01-10 23:02:24] <+jimmy_91> should be more subtle
[2023-01-10 23:02:26] <Chris114> I'm in a old house and hear everything
[2023-01-10 23:02:31] <StrungFX> You shouldnt hear them on the 3rd story facts
[2023-01-10 23:02:32] <3uttmancer> it really does stifle so much interesting gameplay
[2023-01-10 23:02:37] <+snowcrackerz> I find ive been able to sneak pretty good this wipe
[2023-01-10 23:02:49] <+llKite> what if... they got rid of all the headsets?
[2023-01-10 23:02:49] <+Zezzku> Stang9663 I also play drums with my feet when I listen to music at 2am and I live in a block of flats
[2023-01-10 23:02:51] <%+jUstDirtyHenry> move silent skill tree is for sure on a bad place this wipe
[2023-01-10 23:02:58] <krion84> makes solo play much harder

[2023-01-10 23:06:28] <+Masterbob122> That also.  If you wait for sound it sounds like they approach then just...never get to you.  Then they somehow move away at the saem volume until they're just gone.

[2023-01-10 23:19:39] <%+Flookiee> does the laser just need to be on the weapon or does it need to be turned on as well? to get that dumb effect? @Klean
[2023-01-10 23:19:41] <szu_the_snake> When Brandon gets to play more they should add AK-50 as his streamer item and make it crafting only (because it don exist) Kapp
[2023-01-10 23:19:43] <%BeerAndTheMan> 100% Agree
[2023-01-10 23:19:58] <+EthosHowl> cant you bypass that with certain monitors too, the crosshair overlay

[2023-01-10 23:20:38] <+EthosHowl> not recoil control, but if the laser didnt do anything for recoil you technically would never need one no?

[2023-01-10 23:21:42] <$asrodar> Ruger Carbine in .44 Mag would be my vote, good early game gun
[2023-01-10 23:21:51] <%BeerAndTheMan> @szu_the_snake they give him Whiteclawns in game kleanYes
[2023-01-10 23:21:58] <+Zezzku> Also IR lasers when using night vision. Just get rid of the recoil bonus and have lasers be used like they should be
[2023-01-10 23:22:01] <%BeerAndTheMan> whiteclaws*
[2023-01-10 23:22:03] <%+da_bruninator> What about something like the H.C.A.R. in 30-06?
