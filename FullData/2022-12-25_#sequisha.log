[2022-12-25 09:32:27] <%azhogh> @soul_si1ver Imagine not playing for fun, and following meta NODDERS
[2022-12-25 09:32:30] <@%DamienTheDecoy> Seq just makes barb look easy by headshotting everyone

[2022-12-25 09:32:40] <%+Ziknat> mah pottery D:
[2022-12-25 09:32:53] <%JonahVeil> barb is the most difficult class to start IMO.
[2022-12-25 09:32:57] <%JonahVeil> solo at least.
[2022-12-25 09:33:06] <@%DamienTheDecoy> Yea, no range and no healing
[2022-12-25 09:33:16] <@%DamienTheDecoy> At least fighter can use a bow and has a heal ability
[2022-12-25 09:33:22] <%JonahVeil> but once they get going they're some of the best at building loot.
[2022-12-25 09:33:27] <+MankIsDank> @JonahVeil thats what ive been doing and its been fine

[2022-12-25 09:33:41] <%JonahVeil> You can definitely solo with us
[2022-12-25 09:33:45] <@%DamienTheDecoy> I think rogue is definitely easiest to solo, if you stay quiet you can avoid or ambush groups
[2022-12-25 09:33:51] <%JonahVeil> Im just saying its the hardest to start
[2022-12-25 09:33:52] <Foyva> little axe
[2022-12-25 09:33:55] <soul_si1ver> ehh i think fighter could use slight buff tbh, fighter got nerfed kinda hard since old playtests

[2022-12-25 09:36:20] <%myndgamez_> traps should give a small initial dmg hit then a slow after, not a complete root
[2022-12-25 09:36:40] <%JohnDoeRadio> for solo players root is a plus
[2022-12-25 09:36:51] <%JohnDoeRadio> they arent that bad
[2022-12-25 09:36:51] <@%DamienTheDecoy> Eh the root isn't the problem as much as the fact you have to interact with it to cancel it
[2022-12-25 09:36:55] <%TheNecromi> What do you think a health potion tastes like?
[2022-12-25 09:36:59] <%Tuna__00> trap should do damage over time if you try moving maybe @myndgamez_
[2022-12-25 09:37:00] <@%DamienTheDecoy> and if something dies on the trap that can be impossiblke
[2022-12-25 09:37:16] <%JonahVeil> I mean if an arher is camping a trap and u step in it, ur dead everytime
[2022-12-25 09:37:21] <+ketchuponthedog> Honestly tho if you‚Äôre not dying on top of your trap you‚Äôre not a gamer

[2022-12-25 12:11:05] <%scubastevethefirst> i wish i had access to vape juice, i bought like 6 disposables in the states cause japan doesnt do vape anything, and im on my last one

[2022-12-25 12:14:07] <@%DamienTheDecoy> Any yea the bubbling is too much juice in the chamber, meaning the heating element isn't getting hot enough to vaporize it

[2022-12-25 12:14:19] <%scubastevethefirst> @DrakeLionheart they dont do any vape stuff, i think its the laws that make it so you cant do anything with nicotine outside of cigs
[2022-12-25 12:14:26] <paulieglaze> @drakelionheart yeah smoking still huge here.  nicotine juice is illegal to sell
[2022-12-25 12:14:35] <hustlebones666> @DrakeLionheart Prob cigs and likely waste reduction, knowing the effect that disposable vapes could have on a place like Japan
[2022-12-25 12:14:38] <%scubastevethefirst> ^
[2022-12-25 12:14:38] <$DivineHarrisy> yeah usually when mine bubbles its cause too much juice is in the coil at the time

[2022-12-25 17:49:10] <Snowmannftw> agility doesn't affect door open speed, resourcefulness does
[2022-12-25 17:49:11] <+ryan____3> maybe it was already unlocked?

[2022-12-25 17:49:16] <%zohkine> maybe a lockpick hack or something?
[2022-12-25 17:49:17] <%SQUABLY_> did  he have crazy action gear?
[2022-12-25 17:49:19] <xoALLENxo> on archer my base stats are 25 resourcefulness which is 1 less than his. @mufferino
[2022-12-25 17:49:23] <doofizzdrew> maybe the game bugged out
[2022-12-25 17:49:23] <Ovelhazinha> unless it bugged out, he insta opened yea
[2022-12-25 17:49:23] <%Sledge_90> It was prolly server lag

[2022-12-25 17:49:55] <@%DamienTheDecoy> If a chest is already opened the next time you loot it is fast, are doors like that?
[2022-12-25 17:49:55] <+diiatto> and then he toggled it off? Sorry but that seems like Copium to me
[2022-12-25 17:49:57] <Always_FIFO> lol
[2022-12-25 17:49:57] <mufferino> @xoALLENxo thats cool. just mentioning that agi has nothing to do with opening doors :)

[2022-12-25 19:52:24] <SuperCarEnjoyer> at least do a solo lowroller.. but solo highroller would go hard too

[2022-12-25 19:56:53] <%Beakly_> seqChat This game designed for teams is too hard solo seqChat

[2022-12-25 20:33:37] <%Matrixcities> speed boost on barb is dirty
[2022-12-25 20:33:52] <snicklefritzthagawd> yeah its scummy when a 3 man runs up on a one man in spawn tho
[2022-12-25 20:33:53] <Rusty_AF> could try the 25% hp buff ability with morale boost for solo vs trios
[2022-12-25 20:34:02] <+KelemvorUber> dying is funny too :)
[2022-12-25 20:34:08] <grimmern> imho they should remove all kinds of buffs and heals for party. Would make solo play way more viable
[2022-12-25 20:34:11] <dinodongdave> @snicklefritzthagawd 100% thats dirty as hell lol
[2022-12-25 20:34:12] <VelvetSlime> He knew how to fight on the slope too, he had a good position.

[2022-12-25 22:08:55] <+moosE3knucklE> @turkeygoblins i dont remember who said it but i heard the triple shot is not meant to reload the whole quiver when empty. its a bug.

[2022-12-25 22:09:00] <%Mauwii87> oh i see, so if rangers are 1 arrow left before reloading he does that triple shot so he doesnt have 2
[2022-12-25 22:09:11] <TeisNer> u still on HR? i just went potty
[2022-12-25 22:09:21] <%+turkeygoblins> @moosE3knucklE interesting if true, either way it's too strong that way so if it isnt a bug it should be nerfed

[2022-12-25 22:09:36] <+Weedbear420> @Mauwii87 Can do it with 0 arrows left
[2022-12-25 22:09:43] <Smiteeee> You can have 0 arrows left and just use triple shot as a reload, getting 5, shooting 3 of them and then having 2 left.
