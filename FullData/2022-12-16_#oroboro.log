[2022-12-16 03:01:13] <!%+Nekracyst> He will likely have to play with a few settings once he starts talking
[2022-12-16 03:01:20] <!%+Nekracyst> Unless hes been testing for a while and is just now ready to stream
[2022-12-16 03:01:20] <%+ZeGreatPumpkinani> @littlekittles way ahead of you oroSmart

[2022-12-16 03:05:26] <@%Peeve> i mean it sounds good, just needs tweaking. For now I'd say maybe drop the compression a bit, and lower the mic audio overall

[2022-12-16 04:57:23] <%Mercedes_FluffleBuns> How could you use moonveil as if it was acceptable in an honorable fight? Don’t you know it’s the best in slot katana because of how it shoots a projectile in addition to the physical slash? Not to mention the block cancels and reaction roll catches. Can you really stoop so low as to say you’re good when you’re using moonveil?
