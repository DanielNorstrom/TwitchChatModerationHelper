[2022-12-22 19:18:28] <WgCdr_Enriquez> tbh cyclone is the most melee skill ever but in sanctum it's actually a decent choice

[2022-12-22 20:35:33] <VictorCharlie1> my idea is that there's a bunch of old unique jewels that are currently only obtainable by corrupting unique jewels now, which is kinda hard since unique jewels are quite rare now. but there's a source that drops guaranteed an uncorrupted unique jewel every time u does it so u can mass corrupt them into what u want

[2022-12-22 20:49:10] <satsuinotanden> @ds_lily Do you think Raider would be a more optimal choice for poison stacking as opposed to trickster for poison voltaxic lightning arrow? Im test piloting this idea in SC since i have the gear for it for HC going forward lol. Im asking cause you're pretty experienced with raider and have probably done a poison raider in the past.

[2022-12-22 21:41:26] <useless_man> tarkov doesn't require good ping surely, nothing happens in that game you just connect to a server and then disconnect again 8 minutes later
[2022-12-22 21:41:27] <Aeryond> is poison SRS SSF viable ?
[2022-12-22 21:41:29] <%LordTekkless> it depends on the game
[2022-12-22 21:41:46] <!%DoogieMacGyver> tarkov has hard ping caps not sure what they are just know Aus to West isnt allowed

[2022-12-22 23:01:07] BITS: Mr__Khan (100)
[2022-12-22 23:01:07] <@%Mr__Khan> If you fart in a jar and leave it closed: "The sulfur "festers" in there, increasing the potency of the scent. However, the fart also eventually settles on the wall of the jar, decreasing the spread of the smell once the jar is opened. So they'd have to smell right into it for full effect, but it'd be one hell of a stinker once they do." Cheer100

[2022-12-22 23:03:38] <$HiboFlavin> probably
[2022-12-22 23:03:44] <$HiboFlavin> because people are not good with there money
[2022-12-22 23:03:50] <+i_i_o> those viewers wont spend money
[2022-12-22 23:03:50] <%+kalnagh> viewers with less money too so maybe less subs on average
[2022-12-22 23:03:57] <halowedy> i think twitch is like a gacha game all you need is some whales in the audience
[2022-12-22 23:03:58] <+Bones40> more streamers too maybe
[2022-12-22 23:03:59] <CipherJD> I think this is a question the viewer asks the streamer not the other way around!
[2022-12-22 23:03:59] <%jessedubs> ads tho
[2022-12-22 23:04:01] <%Useless_Eater> ads and sponsorships are the big bugs tho Smoge
[2022-12-22 23:04:02] <%tychosnose> probably depends on relative value of subs vs viewers

Specifically, it often alludes to the Fremen belief that the sandworm is a physical embodiment of the One God that created and governs the universe. Thus to the Fremen Shai-Hulud is a sacred term that is usually spoken with a tone of awe, fear, or respect."

[2022-12-22 23:34:01] <@%Kuglorf> Snails poop from their anus, which sits inside their shell towards the front of their body (on the same side as their head). When a snail poops, the poop comes out of the anus inside the shell, then slides out the side of the shell. It looks like a long thin sticky tube and drops to the ground.

[2022-12-22 23:36:09] <@%Kuglorf> Snails eat paper and paper products, like cardboard, paper towels, tissue paper, magazines, newspapers, seed packets, sticky notes, and mail. They eat paper for fiber and calcium. The main ingredient in paper is fiber called cellulose, which comes from trees. Calcium is often added to paper as a filler.
