[2022-12-28 20:32:44] <%+TrickmasteH> The reason you do this, is so the mechanic operates correctly. If you do it early, the destruction armor break will happend with a delay sometimes.

[2022-12-28 21:08:42] <!%micahlee83> A glaive (or glave) is a European polearm, consisting of a single-edged blade on the end of a pole. It is similar to the Japanese naginata, the Chinese guandao, the Korean woldo, and the Russian sovnya.
[2022-12-28 21:09:20] <%+FireZky> Well in russia we called it lancer
[2022-12-28 21:09:24] <%+FireZky> So im used at russian names
[2022-12-28 21:09:25] <%+FireZky> :)
[2022-12-28 21:09:33] <AncientCapitals> it is the correct term. in reality lance master would be incorrect since it doesnt have a lance :P

[2022-12-28 21:36:33] <%+TrickmasteH> The biggest issue with it, is lack of true customer support that actually listens, and can understand the difference.
[2022-12-28 21:36:36] <%+TrickmasteH> Its actually egregious.
[2022-12-28 21:36:51] <%+TrickmasteH> They are simply not educated enough to know the difference.
[2022-12-28 21:37:04] <%+TrickmasteH> Yah but they fail to understand this stuff

[2022-12-28 21:38:38] <%+TrickmasteH> Just the generalization that there customer support cannot distiguish properly.

[2022-12-28 21:40:19] <@%^Streamlabs> because it's the best.
[2022-12-28 21:40:27] <AncientCapitals> very true which is why its very important for support in games to be transperent tbh
[2022-12-28 21:40:27] <@%^Streamlabs> because it's the best.
[2022-12-28 21:40:42] <%+TrickmasteH> But, when a person spends lets say Hypothetically 5-10k on the game legitimately. That person somehow gets banned for whatever false reason, and then the people with there pitch forks are out, instead of maybe listening because I am sure they have lost a few players that truly support the game because they don't listen and check the evidence in depth enough.
[2022-12-28 21:40:42] <+markyymarkjunior> because someone bought it with legit money

[2022-12-28 22:46:59] <MRxVIKO> true that if they can find people for it
[2022-12-28 22:47:02] <%+FireZky> Atleast my school it always teacher who picked teams
[2022-12-28 22:47:15] <%+FireZky> Well they did great and make it even most of time to be honest
[2022-12-28 22:47:29] <%+FireZky> Ofc they know who is good which sport

[2022-12-28 22:48:58] <%+Ehxcalibur> i go into every learning party not expecting to clear but to get better lol
[2022-12-28 22:49:22] <%scPali> YEP same i accept those on valtan
[2022-12-28 22:49:37] <%scPali> since we can carry no matter what
[2022-12-28 22:49:40] <%scPali> so i don't mind helping
[2022-12-28 22:49:45] <%polig> id gatekeep them on OH
[2022-12-28 22:49:52] <%polig> no free passs!
[2022-12-28 22:50:01] <+thenuttyprof> learning groups are great when the group doesnt have rl stuff to do, when they do or they work then WE wait
[2022-12-28 22:50:01] <%scPali> vykas can be Jailge yeah
[2022-12-28 22:50:07] <%scPali> it's why i stopped doing them LUL

[2022-12-28 22:50:40] <+olympicsage> if they make the raids gear capped all this gatekeeping will go away. and if u say then whats the point of gearing up that much, well the gear itself will be the gatekeeper almost as it is today, but without the players who decide who to gatekept. hmm
[2022-12-28 22:50:45] <+sl1ine> reddit is such a cesspool man
[2022-12-28 22:52:05] <%polig> gatekeeping wont go away, just live with and adjust or you wont be happy simple as that
[2022-12-28 22:52:13] <AncientCapitals> what i dislike is the gate system and how harsh it is if you dont "finish" , it sets you back like a full week in terms of when you can complete relic sets

[2022-12-28 22:53:06] <%+Ehxcalibur> oh snap
[2022-12-28 22:53:10] <%+Ehxcalibur> new drops?
[2022-12-28 22:53:12] <AncientCapitals> i mean for sure when you are at the endgame that might be true but for us that are trying to catch up to current content its quite punishing
[2022-12-28 22:53:47] <%scPali> the stoopz example is great

[2022-12-28 22:54:31] <+thenuttyprof> when people gatekeep roster level its shit for those who server swap
[2022-12-28 22:54:49] <%alex__gfy> @Baker off topic, choilicious is streaming rn if you wanted to harass them about scrappers
[2022-12-28 22:55:05] <@+klone_iron_fist> me? 6
[2022-12-28 22:55:16] <%scPali> roster level can definitely get you gatekept
[2022-12-28 22:55:19] <+olympicsage> @Baker  do you rotate between ur alts with the gold earning thing by doing raids and such? or u just lv them for fun and doing guardians?
[2022-12-28 22:55:26] <%scPali> in that case it's probably best to try to go for the title or smtn
[2022-12-28 22:55:34] <%scPali> yy same
[2022-12-28 22:55:53] <+thenuttyprof> why is it bull shit when u can look at group finder and see high roster level reqs
[2022-12-28 22:55:54] <@%^Streamlabs> because it's the best.

[2022-12-28 22:56:37] <AncientCapitals> havnt really seen roster level at any point tbh, im only roster 90 and i get accepted
[2022-12-28 22:56:42] <%scPali> since usually that means ppl are confident in the fight
[2022-12-28 22:56:57] <%scPali> been doing great so far
[2022-12-28 22:57:18] <+olympicsage> so you do rotate nice to see someone is doing wat i was thinking to do also but i got scared cause i thought its not that efficient. but fun is all about here. i needed a small approve :D on doing that
[2022-12-28 22:57:25] <+thenuttyprof> also i admit i dont know mechs that well and i didnt apply to any group i was saying high roster reqs do exist

[2022-12-28 22:57:35] <MRxVIKO> there is a difference between gatekeep and people who want to do it fast
[2022-12-28 22:57:40] <MRxVIKO> just saying
[2022-12-28 22:57:47] <%scPali> @MRxVIKO very true

[2022-12-28 22:58:33] <%scPali> that's the best way since there's always like 10x more ppl looking than making parties
[2022-12-28 22:58:33] <%naujokas3> found it :D
[2022-12-28 22:58:48] <+olympicsage> ohhh w8 w8 u get all the mats? even on those alts (outside of the 6)?
[2022-12-28 22:58:56] <+olympicsage> cause iv never saw how it is
[2022-12-28 22:59:03] <Sasquoth> And then there is a picky support that will not join your party. :D
[2022-12-28 22:59:19] <+olympicsage> shit.. im so envy u lol ill work on it asap thx
[2022-12-28 22:59:25] <AncientCapitals> i set gold-earners to the ones that needs to open chest so you dont minus that much =)
[2022-12-28 22:59:39] <%scPali> finding sup can be pain, can't argue that one
[2022-12-28 23:00:00] <AncientCapitals> does brel give more gold then vykas for example (vykas hard) ?
[2022-12-28 23:00:04] <%scPali> YEP
[2022-12-28 23:00:18] <%scPali> @AncientCapitals Yes it's 8k if you don't buy anything
[2022-12-28 23:00:28] VIEWERS: 582
[2022-12-28 23:00:28] <+olympicsage> holy 8k?!?!
[2022-12-28 23:00:30] <%scPali> vs 4.5 for vatlan vykas clown
[2022-12-28 23:00:32] <AncientCapitals> but you are going to atleast open chests :P
[2022-12-28 23:00:37] <+olympicsage> 8 for all 6 gates?
[2022-12-28 23:00:47] <@+klone_iron_fist> Support will be a problem until they add "500% damage when doing solo chaos dungeons and main quests/dailies"
[2022-12-28 23:00:54] <+olympicsage> still 8 is very nice amount
[2022-12-28 23:00:56] <%scPali> but realistically yoiu'll buy chests
[2022-12-28 23:00:58] <%scPali> so it's a lot less
[2022-12-28 23:01:00] <%scPali> like half
[2022-12-28 23:01:01] <+Caedes55> i dont want to do 6 g6's a week
[2022-12-28 23:01:05] <%hoodidupeh> we only have 2 sup classes its SG that fucked up on that one
[2022-12-28 23:01:05] <%scPali> need to check exact numbers
[2022-12-28 23:01:59] <Sasquoth> Many people in KR just do gate 1-2 Brel as it gives most gold.
[2022-12-28 23:02:05] <+Caedes55> @hoodidupeh its not the classes. its general support design. i have a bard and paladin at 1475 and i feel ZERO increase in power honing them to 1490
[2022-12-28 23:02:11] <%hoodidupeh> 4 man party so every 4th character should have a sup spec
[2022-12-28 23:02:27] <%hoodidupeh> @hoodidupeh doesnt matter ppl still enjoy playing them

[2022-12-28 23:02:59] <AncientCapitals> when they make a cool support class ill make one right now they feel lame, might look into artist though
[2022-12-28 23:03:17] <+Caedes55> you enjoy throwing gold at a class that doesnt get any increase in power? will you have a 1520 artist w1? @hoodidupeh
[2022-12-28 23:03:44] <%Kwadrat_> 1520? nah 1500 prolly
[2022-12-28 23:03:48] <%alex__gfy> yea 7800 a book
[2022-12-28 23:04:11] <%hoodidupeh> @Caedes55 never said that isnt a problem, but the main one is missing sup classes
[2022-12-28 23:04:13] <+Caedes55> dont buy adr. you want it on your 9/7 stone
[2022-12-28 23:04:19] <AncientCapitals> grudge books is where its at
[2022-12-28 23:04:20] <%scPali> ok for people who wanted to know: brel 6 is 8k without chests, 4k if you buy them all
[2022-12-28 23:04:28] VIEWERS: 582
[2022-12-28 23:04:29] <%+Ehxcalibur> adren and ether pred are the things you can run at 1-2 and still be effective right?
[2022-12-28 23:04:37] <%Kwadrat_> i think it wouldnt it would be guys having 6 supps
[2022-12-28 23:04:49] <%Kwadrat_> its problem prevalent in each mmo
[2022-12-28 23:04:56] <AncientCapitals> 17500gold / grudge book my god
[2022-12-28 23:04:57] <%Kwadrat_> no tanks and supports
[2022-12-28 23:04:59] <%alex__gfy> youre right, id only have to run adrenaline at 2 for the ideal setup
[2022-12-28 23:05:05] <%Kwadrat_> no matter how diverse supports are
[2022-12-28 23:05:17] <+Caedes55> they could add more support classes all they want. if i hone to 1500, i should be able to solo a chaos dungeon purple portal boss without an entirely different set
[2022-12-28 23:05:20] <AncientCapitals> you doing the rehersal mode of brel?
[2022-12-28 23:05:46] <%Kwadrat_> why would he u get stamps for just clearing normal brel
[2022-12-28 23:05:46] <@%^Streamlabs> because it's the best.
[2022-12-28 23:05:46] <AncientCapitals> ah no now i see regular :P
[2022-12-28 23:05:49] <Sasquoth> if DPS option was equally as good for supports as with other classes, there would be more supports. People would just make 2 builds.

[2022-12-28 23:08:07] <%Kwadrat_> u have to drop 55 and u can use them as u wish
[2022-12-28 23:08:32] <AncientCapitals> so you get to use the 55 or they get "used" to unlock it?
