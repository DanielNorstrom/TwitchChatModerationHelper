[2022-12-21 00:01:39] <brutalist_toast> the best thing I found in this game is that I can interview or convict any being, since them according to a dog, all crimes were committed by a wondering goose
[2022-12-21 00:01:39] <%zman12380> That just means you need to expand more :)

[2022-12-21 00:01:40] <Leud_De_Grace> The military stuff is what annoys me the most in this game

[2022-12-21 20:40:20] <%+hesh4err> I'll buy you a video game for Christmas
[2022-12-21 20:40:26] <Dragonator_g> I once got a videogame for christmas. I don't think anyone ever heard of it before.
[2022-12-21 20:40:26] <%Spinel97> Something really cool happened on December 25th 1914
[2022-12-21 20:40:29] <@%Greygull> someone buy her choo-choo charles
[2022-12-21 20:40:30] <%JoJo0217> even between my cousins n whatnot I'm the only one that plays video games LUL
[2022-12-21 20:40:34] <@%Dawnyan> I often ended up with shovelware games from my aunts
[2022-12-21 20:40:35] <%Noruko> I ask myself for them year round and then when Christmas comes, I tell myself they were early presents. And then my hedonism is justified.
[2022-12-21 20:40:37] <%jediknight223> I just ask for money and buy the game mysef.

[2022-12-21 21:38:31] <Tolrath1> I do find Tri Fire better as enemies become immune to ailments in later missions
[2022-12-21 21:38:41] <RoboticFemboy> final fantasy is the type of game to have "tri-fire" be better than "hell-fire" to be fair, so

[2022-12-21 21:47:45] <dresden81> you sell them for 50k
[2022-12-21 21:47:45] <%HitoBeat> 12 was a single player MMO and a bit of a slog
[2022-12-21 21:47:45] <TheSpitefulCrow> 12 is good, you just have to ignore Vaan
[2022-12-21 21:47:49] <%cambrianArjuna> i should play ff12, it's one that i havent played or watched someone stream limesO

[2022-12-21 21:48:02] <%OneManAgainstheOdds> game play FF12 is fine. it's very different. BUT. the main character they chose is NOT the main character. Vaan sucks and is a stand in. the real heroes are your party member
[2022-12-21 21:48:03] <!%Laimubot> hahah rush goaly messed up way over my roaring AC unit LKimes
[2022-12-21 21:48:04] <StickInMud> 12 i liked, but the combat system is... not for everyone. it works a bit like xenoblade, from what i've heard

[2022-12-21 21:48:11] <StickInMud> kinda MMO cooldown based

[2022-12-21 21:50:18] <ululator> you can still play 11 on private servers. it's pretty interesting old school, your avatar can block other avatars, so you actually have to avoid each other walking down the street
[2022-12-21 21:50:21] <StickInMud> @DemonedAway i feel like that happens in a lot of final fantasy: "gampeplay is good except for this ONE  wonky thing"

[2022-12-21 23:28:26] <+Drag0n92> original was real time too wasnt it?
[2022-12-21 23:28:50] <+Mithos56> yeah original was real time
