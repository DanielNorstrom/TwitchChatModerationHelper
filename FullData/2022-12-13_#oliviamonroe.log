[2022-12-13 16:14:15] <!%ZiBookishGamer> The first game has a lot of good memories for me, played it so many times lol. I also have a bunch of the books.

[2022-12-13 16:14:17] <%RedOniVA> Does Diablo still run well on newer hardware? I would've thought it'd be hell to get running on new OSes.

[2022-12-13 16:14:32] <!%AirahsELL> i mean thats the most accurate game summary youve given for any diablo game. diablo 1: kill diablo. diablo 2: kill diablo again and then kill Baal. diablo 3: kill diablo a surprisingly 3rd time and then the Angel of Death.

[2022-12-13 16:16:35] <%Furudehan> Starcraft was the one with the N64 version.
[2022-12-13 16:16:41] <%+Ungadyne> You Will Know Our Names

[2022-12-13 16:17:50] <Komfigaming> it's so repetitive tho?
[2022-12-13 16:17:56] <!%AirahsELL> "a lot of jrpg music is similar sounding" meanwhile SMT used a funky disco beat for when youre fighting a giant disco ball
[2022-12-13 16:18:01] <JilEmma_Reene> i might still have a whole PS1 memory card for Diablo save game and characters on my shelf

[2022-12-13 16:35:56] <+Savage_Maelstrom> It shows the police take the character away and they're all like "Ah ha, I knew it all along! Wait, Oh no, what have I done!?"
[2022-12-13 16:36:01] <%Nullamm> nah, if it's too big, it won't fit through the doorway. keep it small
[2022-12-13 16:36:02] <%TalkingObject> Why not Diablo one?
[2022-12-13 16:36:06] <%Furudehan> Stand in the doorway and push your arms up against the side for 30 seconds, step out then see what happens.
[2022-12-13 16:36:06] <Temporal_Paradox> 2 is the best one

[2022-12-13 17:15:49] <%+ctr_best_racing_game> whichever one is right
[2022-12-13 17:15:49] <%$GimmeAFreekinUsername> quake 1 100%

[2022-12-13 17:16:00] <%$SirArchemKnight> DOOM is more rocky/red brown

[2022-12-13 17:16:05] <InaneDugong> doom was 2d la, quake was semi 3d
[2022-12-13 17:16:09] <%+shibiririreruwa> Geometry is too advanced for DOOM
[2022-12-13 17:16:10] <%$SirArchemKnight> This is industrial so Quake 1
[2022-12-13 17:16:13] <Redamaford> ....doom HAS NO TEXTURES OR POLYGONS, CHAT
[2022-12-13 17:16:16] <Temporal_Paradox> it's not doom

[2022-12-13 17:29:38] <%Tylphen> we all saw Amnesia as the VERY FIRST YOUTUBERS GAME. Markiplier and PewDiePie basically started their careers on this game way back when

[2022-12-13 18:19:56] <$Puipu> it was super dark and we couldn't see anything and we got scorbu when going to school and WE LIKED IT
[2022-12-13 18:19:57] <%Sotetsu> What is the difference between Legacy and Remastered?
[2022-12-13 18:20:02] <!%Catbag> does it hate the period?
[2022-12-13 18:20:02] <steelgolem9> remove the . ?
[2022-12-13 18:20:04] <%ArcReaper_21> probably the period

[2022-12-13 18:24:49] <%Megaket> If you type an exclamation mark infront of what you say in the game, it appears above your character I think
[2022-12-13 18:24:53] <%MayShip> and to think no one would ever top these graphics
[2022-12-13 18:24:56] <Chicken_And_Blue_Waffles> CTRL is run ? wasnt it R ?
[2022-12-13 18:24:59] <+JayBusch> Hold control to run
[2022-12-13 18:25:04] <GuyMcGuy> R is the run toggle :)

[2022-12-13 18:25:09] <@%Athagorn> I think it's shift or ctrl to run.

[2022-12-13 18:35:50] <marklarphd> The original graphics did the best they could for the time. Remastered smoothed things out, but only brought things up to the quality of a low budget modern game

[2022-12-13 19:04:26] <$PleaseStopSayingLiterally> this stash is huge compared to the original
[2022-12-13 19:04:31] <mewmewkissycutie_> 90% of the stuff you pick up in this game doesn't deserve a stash space
[2022-12-13 19:04:33] <!%$rumbagthe> anything red, you cant use so sell it

[2022-12-13 19:04:51] <Womperschnitzel> Orb is basically a magic wand
[2022-12-13 19:04:54] <PigWithoutProtection> orbs can be valuable IIRC
[2022-12-13 19:04:58] <Crytone> should sell it
[2022-12-13 19:04:59] <%TalkingObject> Orbs are for pondering
[2022-12-13 19:05:01] <PigWithoutProtection> as in you can sell it for a lot
[2022-12-13 19:05:02] <baccon13> basically you can sell everuthing you dont use

[2022-12-13 19:06:50] <%GinTamashiVT> This menu reminds me a lot of Fate
[2022-12-13 19:06:54] <%TenderVT> Silent hill 2 is the best psychological horror game of all time imo

[2022-12-13 19:08:06] <%Sotetsu> System Shock was so scary I had to put it down for 2 months to gather my courage. olivia50Shock
[2022-12-13 19:08:08] <$PleaseStopSayingLiterally> red means you can't use it yet
[2022-12-13 19:08:09] <Womperschnitzel> nothing gives you anxiety like the Sonic drowning music
[2022-12-13 19:08:09] <ChibiDeviChaosCH> dino crisis was horryfying to me back then
[2022-12-13 19:08:13] <%TenderVT> Resident evil 1 snake scared me but I was real smol
[2022-12-13 19:08:18] <azoththemaster4> now as being so jaded and heavily desensitized not much really scares me no
[2022-12-13 19:08:22] <+JayBusch> It might have extra benefits

[2022-12-13 19:10:23] <+TheOmegaPaladin> I think its Cute
[2022-12-13 19:10:27] <!%AirahsELL> the way this works is that using an identify scroll will roll the bonus stats on the item so you can figure out how good it is. and yes, it is a stupid system and other diablo clone hackyslashes got rid of that system altogether.
[2022-12-13 19:10:27] <RaxWN> you may store your money on your stash

[2022-12-13 19:14:37] <%MayShip> do you not have a phone Oli?

[2022-12-13 19:14:44] <ughdontmakemeregister> when they announced the diablo mobile game fans were so angry at the conference one of the devs tried to salvage it by joking 'do you guys have phones' and it made everyone madder
[2022-12-13 19:14:53] VIEWERS: 577
[2022-12-13 19:14:55] <%MayShip> nice
[2022-12-13 19:15:00] <!%AirahsELL> yes. they announced a mobile only pay to win Diablo game, Diablo Immortal, and when people booed the devs said "Do you guys not have phones?" it was really spiteful but kinda funny
[2022-12-13 19:15:06] <NagasakiMH> yeah they screwed up
[2022-12-13 19:15:10] <+TheOmegaPaladin> Kind of Suprised you Pick Barb and Not Necro. You want to hit things I guess?
[2022-12-13 19:15:11] <ughdontmakemeregister> YEP
[2022-12-13 19:15:14] <undeadblackzero> "don't you all have phones?!"
[2022-12-13 19:15:17] <+Ser_Destroyer> exactly
[2022-12-13 19:15:19] <ChibiDeviChaosCH> everybody expected dianlo 4
[2022-12-13 19:15:25] <Womperschnitzel> You got it
[2022-12-13 19:15:26] <%MayShip> imagine waiting years for mobile
[2022-12-13 19:15:27] <Proteus42> that's exactly what happened. LUL
[2022-12-13 19:15:32] <%+Abstract_Endurance> @ughdontmakemeregister you forgot that a lone hero asked them "Is this an out of season April Fools joke?"
[2022-12-13 19:15:37] <Komfigaming> and THEN they got upset at everyone being upset
[2022-12-13 19:15:38] <JoesGuy> I watch Oli on a computer like an adult.
[2022-12-13 19:15:39] <Proteus42> yea we didn't want Diablo on mobile
[2022-12-13 19:15:42] <Crytone> it's P2W
[2022-12-13 19:15:44] <$sleepyxellos> extremely pay to win
[2022-12-13 19:15:46] <Womperschnitzel> mobile games are cheap mictrotransaction laden shovelware
[2022-12-13 19:15:48] <Proteus42> Diablo Immortal is super duper greedy.
[2022-12-13 19:15:50] <+JayBusch> Yep. They told the most hardcore Blizzard fans “we want to take more of your money in a predatory mobile game”
[2022-12-13 19:15:53] <%Megaket> It was really funny, they showed the diablo logo and everyone was cheering, and then said it was mobile and the cheers became boos
[2022-12-13 19:15:55] <marklarphd> If it was a PSVita game I would have loved it
[2022-12-13 19:15:55] <raxx1217> blizzard is so out of touch with their fan base
[2022-12-13 19:15:57] <KarmaEnigma> It is very p2w
[2022-12-13 19:15:58] <Proteus42> Pay To Win
[2022-12-13 19:16:02] <NagasakiMH> they made immoral acessable for pc after it.. but still its the peak of psychological abuseive pay2win id ever seen in my netire life
[2022-12-13 19:16:02] <%+Abstract_Endurance> 100k to max a character btw
[2022-12-13 19:16:02] <fantasticbovine> it was the very best in monetisation
[2022-12-13 19:16:04] <+UrdFire> immortal is a money sink.
[2022-12-13 19:16:05] <Komfigaming> $100,000 needed to play it
[2022-12-13 19:16:07] <Echiko> i remember that awkward conference LUL
[2022-12-13 19:16:07] <$StrikingWalrus> it went from pc to mobile exclusive, then they backtracked
[2022-12-13 19:16:09] <!%AirahsELL> no it was not. one of the big streamers basically pointed out it would cost like 300k to max out a single character.
[2022-12-13 19:16:20] <JoesGuy> Only the best paid for horse armor
[2022-12-13 19:16:21] <%gorillafinn> also uhhh... blizzard doesent have the best history of trearing employees right
[2022-12-13 19:16:23] <+Ser_Destroyer> the right move was to announce the mobile and then D4 right after like they did with fallout
[2022-12-13 19:16:23] <Proteus42> LOL
[2022-12-13 19:16:31] <PigWithoutProtection> ye Diablo Immortal is close to a scam
[2022-12-13 19:16:38] <Redamaford> There was that one guy who spent so much money on the game that he couldn't actually play the game because he was too OP.
[2022-12-13 19:16:44] <Proteus42> Fallout 76 oof
[2022-12-13 19:16:52] <Womperschnitzel> there was the guy who put like 10 000 $ into Diablo Immortal's loot boxes and didn't even get top-tier items
[2022-12-13 19:16:54] <%MayShip> a lot of things happened with Fallout.
[2022-12-13 19:16:54] <NagasakiMH> Diablo Immoral is 1 step away frrom absolutely Illegal

[2022-12-13 19:16:56] <%StuckBoy> absolutely not
[2022-12-13 19:16:57] <ChibiDeviChaosCH> no
[2022-12-13 19:16:57] <!%AirahsELL> "it just works" was fallout 3 i think
[2022-12-13 19:16:57] <JoesGuy> It's the one that was a multiplayer game that was awful
[2022-12-13 19:16:58] <Proteus42> no
[2022-12-13 19:17:01] <%Megaket> Not in the least LUL
[2022-12-13 19:17:03] <$StrikingWalrus> no he's fallout/skyrim
[2022-12-13 19:17:03] <NagasakiMH> and thats not a meme, its a fact

[2022-12-13 19:17:09] <raxx1217> nope. todd howard is bethesda
[2022-12-13 19:17:09] <Proteus42> Tod Howard saying "it just works" was about Fallout 4.
[2022-12-13 19:17:12] <Womperschnitzel> It just works was Fallout 4
[2022-12-13 19:17:12] <ChibiDeviChaosCH> fallout 76
[2022-12-13 19:17:12] <%spongeofmystery> "It just works" was from Fallout 4's building mechanics
[2022-12-13 19:17:12] <WynDWys> The right move was to announce D4, then mobile after with its earlier release date as "Play this until D4 is out"
[2022-12-13 19:17:13] <%+Abstract_Endurance> Todd "The Godd" Howard wasn't involved here
[2022-12-13 19:17:13] <+JayBusch> Todd Coward is Bethesda, not Blizzard

[2022-12-13 19:17:40] <+Ser_Destroyer> and at least fallout shelter was good XD
[2022-12-13 19:17:40] <SupernovaSAVersion> Fallout 4 was still fun imo
[2022-12-13 19:17:47] <WynDWys> Technically in alphabetical order, Bethesda comes first.

[2022-12-13 19:17:52] <ChibiDeviChaosCH> yeh fallout 4 was pretty ok
[2022-12-13 19:17:55] <!%AirahsELL> Todd Howard explained King Crimson properly

[2022-12-13 19:18:07] <Phantorum_prime117> Apparently someone did some calculations on how much time it would take to grind everything in Diablo Immortal
[2022-12-13 19:18:08] <KarmaEnigma> They announced Elder Scrolls 6 at the end because they knew they would end up doing a blizzard lol

[2022-12-13 19:30:17] <%GinTamashiVT> I've never played Diablo, but you seem to be doing good!
[2022-12-13 19:30:22] <@%DrGoodStrats> I don't really understand why games think it's necessary to limit inventory space. It jsut makes the gmae tedious. it's not more challenging for it.

[2022-12-13 19:30:35] <!%AirahsELL> OH NO NOT FATE
[2022-12-13 19:30:48] <+JayBusch> @drgoodstrats Well, in the old days, it’s because we didn’t have that much memory to save stuff.
[2022-12-13 19:30:48] <Tursmo> If you didn't limit inventory space, you would end up with 2 trillion items. How are you supposed to go through that
[2022-12-13 19:30:54] <!%AirahsELL> Fate is...a very broken diabloclone.
[2022-12-13 19:30:56] <raxx1217> HUH

[2022-12-13 19:31:00] <marklarphd> My friends used to give each other rare Diablo 2 items as Christmas and birthday gifts. That's the true Diablo 2 experience
[2022-12-13 19:31:07] <%GinTamashiVT> Ohh Fatte! It honestly seems like it might be a clone to this. It was one I played in middle school that came free with my PC and ismore of a fantasy setting
[2022-12-13 19:31:16] <%TalkingObject> This plays like whack a mole.
[2022-12-13 19:31:19] <@%DrGoodStrats> @JayBusch But the items are in the game moistGrump maybe it's somethign like that though.
[2022-12-13 19:31:20] <+JayBusch> Diablo definitely spawned a lot of clones
[2022-12-13 19:31:23] <Tursmo> If I got Stone of jordan as a present...
[2022-12-13 19:31:28] <NagasakiMH> the inventory stuff was due to coding and 32bit restriction, but that is gone in the year of 2022.

[2022-12-13 19:33:30] <NagasakiMH> but etherial items have such a low chance to drop, you can play 5k hours straight and never drop it once

[2022-12-13 19:41:31] <aldurilo> 3-5 years

[2022-12-13 19:41:36] <@%Athagorn> I just change mine when it breaks or if it's impossible to use.
[2022-12-13 19:41:36] <enclave2701> every 5 years

[2022-12-13 19:41:48] <%TalkingObject> I only get phones if they have the headphone jack. Which is getting rarer every year.
[2022-12-13 19:41:48] <marklarphd> I got a new phone once and went back to my old phone after it broke

[2022-12-13 19:41:59] <!%AirahsELL> i used to be on a leasing program so i could trade in every year for a new one, and then i owned my last one for 4 years before getting a new one
