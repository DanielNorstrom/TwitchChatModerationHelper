[2022-12-19 00:12:00] <%+arozgrindz> isnt it like this with every game that endures a couple of years, is that it forms an "elite" that rules the game, and new beginners get fkn rekt. Then the threshold of learning the game gets even harder right and less people want to play it?

[2022-12-19 00:14:02] <%+liink2thepast> Play more, tarkov will make you feel dead inside and you will no longer feel anything towards your gear
[2022-12-19 00:14:06] <%SykoScicle> Here's how I get rid of gear fear. If I get something I'm too afraid to run and lose, I just sell it.
[2022-12-19 00:14:06] <datboynutss> if you stop playing and come back, the gear fear might as well
[2022-12-19 00:14:06] <cryptthegaminggod> @WWooka Just think about gear as it was never yours to begin with. Also just playing the game helps you learn over time that death is gonna happen and running worse gear just makes you more likely to die
[2022-12-19 00:14:06] <%NeverNewd> and dont play whole stoned. turns tarkov into a horror game
[2022-12-19 00:14:13] <stigsunson> and the chances of losing when running good gear are lower
[2022-12-19 00:14:15] <%NeverNewd> while*

Had like 5 friends that tried it, and just stop playing because it was really hard. But the main problem here is that we need to fill up with new players so the game doesnt die

[2022-12-19 20:37:04] <%+forcefed7> @curlyfriesncoke1 agreed. They're still using 2000s plastic for their interior. Thats why I said Toyota been phoning it in for years now. Just riding on their success from 20 years ago

[2022-12-19 20:50:44] <%+hyvlarN69> thanks! @Rouxal
[2022-12-19 20:50:49] <%Drolyx> Type one is rare. Insulin injections I think are what they take
[2022-12-19 20:50:54] <%WingWangWaffle> My Timmy squad of 2 got dropped and it was just me‚Ä¶. I successfully 1v3 the chads and it felt so good as a Timmy just 1 tapping all 3
[2022-12-19 20:51:06] <%Ms_SyKleZ> type 2 yes, type 1 is mainly genetic
[2022-12-19 20:51:06] <+mavvkek> Type 1 is genetic iirc
[2022-12-19 20:51:06] <palms____> Genetics
[2022-12-19 20:51:06] <+RebeliusGaming> type 1 is hereditary
[2022-12-19 20:51:07] <mojden> Type 1 is genetic
[2022-12-19 20:51:07] <%+Raccaway> Type 1 is genetic I think
[2022-12-19 20:51:09] <Rouxal> @hyvlarN69 <3 <3
[2022-12-19 20:51:13] <mojden> type 2 can be lifestyle
[2022-12-19 20:51:13] <+opterios> Genetic mostly, but too much sugar can also contribute.
[2022-12-19 20:51:13] <%+hyvlarN69> eating fast carbs, for example sugar really often
[2022-12-19 20:51:14] <$wafflexsoup> @WillerZ The exact cause of most types of diabetes is unknown. In all cases, sugar builds up in the bloodstream. This is because the pancreas doesn't produce enough insulin. Both type 1 and type 2 diabetes may be caused by a combination of genetic or environmental factors.
[2022-12-19 20:51:15] <+drippyswaze> Ik willerz hit up the dispos
[2022-12-19 20:51:17] <%Zosimos> type 1 is theorized to be an autoimmune disorder that attacks insulin producing cells, type 2 is due to obesity
[2022-12-19 20:51:18] <+RebeliusGaming> type 2 you dont eat healthy
[2022-12-19 20:51:19] <BaghouL_Live> Genetic and yeah unhealthy lifestyles
[2022-12-19 20:51:23] <%Drolyx> Type 2 can generally be managed by diet and exercise
[2022-12-19 20:51:26] <%+Jay_Coe> isn't it when the pancreas can't break down sugar or something?
[2022-12-19 20:51:26] <%AZ_JINX> type 1 is genetic ususallu

[2022-12-19 20:51:34] <%+captf1shyf1nger> type 1 you're born with, type 2 is you dont eat right
[2022-12-19 20:51:46] <%+swankxy> pancreas does not supply enough isilan as it should.
[2022-12-19 20:52:04] <Klicer_> tons of unhealthy carbs > a lot of visceral fat > type 2 diabetes
[2022-12-19 20:52:10] <%smoke802x> @Zosimos not necessarily  obesity although that is definitely a leading cause
[2022-12-19 20:52:15] <%GrimHydraulix> Nurse here, both have ties to genetics, tldr is your pancreas has issues
[2022-12-19 20:52:17] <$wafflexsoup> yes

[2022-12-19 20:52:29] <%+captf1shyf1nger> diabetes is when you become insulin resistant
[2022-12-19 20:52:35] <Klicer_> you can get type 2 diabetes without being obese, just have to eat tons of simple carbs

[2022-12-19 21:18:08] <%+minty747> when i comes to 9mm the easiest best ammo to get is RiP and CCi
[2022-12-19 21:18:14] <%+M4EDutch> and / or, just have LESS of the OP ammo
[2022-12-19 21:18:19] <%NotNatooli> the obvious thing to do would be to nerf all the bullets again and buff bp
[2022-12-19 21:18:24] <%+hyvlarN69> ap 6.3 is in a weird place, trash ammo thats hard to get and expensive. they should just make it better or cheaper
[2022-12-19 21:18:26] <Fantaman___> IRL you can take like 10 9mm shots and not die so i guesss they try to feel realistic

[2022-12-19 21:19:04] <RoadsignCheems> ion care what anyone say i got menu music on 100 cuz it goes crazy after a good raid
[2022-12-19 21:19:05] <%+everydayTHc> should be craft only
[2022-12-19 21:19:05] <%+Janglez_> i think once the flea isn't readily accessible BP will be very hard to get
[2022-12-19 21:19:08] <+theinviam> @ashes666 literally nothing, couple guns and ammo that likely wont get used and a map that wont really be anything new

[2022-12-19 21:19:43] <%JNORTHBERG> yeah that works for you guys that can play the game several more hours then other people
[2022-12-19 21:19:44] <+theinviam> @BombedAlbatross squads are easier to fight then 1v1 anyday
[2022-12-19 21:19:45] <%+swatibuhgott> make it viable for people who don't max traders immediately to still be competitive with meta guns and ammo found in raid.
[2022-12-19 21:19:46] <RoadsignCheems> i dont think you should restrict good guns, i think you should make the worse guns able to compete
[2022-12-19 21:19:46] <mojden> Just take the rd and mutant out back like they did the val PepeLaugh

[2022-12-19 21:21:09] <Stebahno> Ammo and high end gun parts should be lootable only and/ or barter only.
[2022-12-19 21:21:11] <BrainbowR6> That is every game though. Developer in general these days, imo, do themselves a massive disservice when they go away from what made them successful to begin with.
[2022-12-19 21:21:14] <+imLelly> @BombedAlbatross This isn't to mitigate capitilism necessarily but to balance game. If everyone shoots PS, it's based off of skill. The casual shouldn't just have an upperhand because they have BP and no skill versus a chad with PS and skill
[2022-12-19 21:21:16] <%+kraetor_92> uh

[2022-12-19 21:22:13] <moshnroll3> hey ggs bro
[2022-12-19 21:22:16] <+SurefiredCB> Just no gear/weapons on flea would be fun

[2022-12-19 21:22:22] <+theinviam> this game used to actually be a kick in the nuts, now its just a joke of what it used to be

[2022-12-19 21:22:27] <Satanizcool> how long ago was that

[2022-12-19 21:22:37] <%+NattyNatty2x4> no flea market for everyone sounds fun, no flea market just for me when i bought this game a month ago was not what I'd call fun lol

[2022-12-19 21:22:48] <%+stribbits> See that was easy for a streamer to say but if im a casual who plays rarely i needed the flea to keep up with people who chad'd to level 50 while i was 15
[2022-12-19 21:22:50] <%+Janglez_> maybe they add computer to hideout this wipe PauseChamp
[2022-12-19 21:22:50] <%+kraetor_92> going in juiced from the start every raid isn't fun imo

[2022-12-19 21:23:39] <%+swatibuhgott> @therules_ this for sure. like EVE Online - not a "casual game"
[2022-12-19 21:23:42] <%+igooey> you were a casual when there was 1k players
[2022-12-19 21:23:43] <%Megachrist> The only thing I hate about the flea, is it takes the sense of accomplishment away. Pre-Flea was nice because when you go to the best gear, only people who also were grinding got there and it felt like actual progression.
[2022-12-19 21:23:45] <%T_RAN> @Stebahno i played the remastered but not much else of diablo. i heard pd2 is pretty rad
[2022-12-19 21:23:51] <+opterios> Indeed, it's just unlucky for some of us who love the game but can't play too much.
[2022-12-19 21:24:00] <+composr> But EVE online would still be playable by a casual gamer because you could skill while offline
[2022-12-19 21:24:05] <%+stribbits> Technically your rewarded with stuff being way cheaper through traders
[2022-12-19 21:24:10] <mistahmurdah> they should also be paired with similarly skilled players... SBMM
[2022-12-19 21:24:12] <AK47GARRY> the only thing that kills it for casuals is wiping every 6 months would you agree @WillerZ
[2022-12-19 21:24:22] <%tajakijaki> i used to love the flee. but now i just feel like the game would just be better without it. also i hope they make good ammo harder to come across, or make more viable but not meta ammo to fill in the gap from bad to meta ammo.
[2022-12-19 21:24:26] <%+swatibuhgott> @composr that's true. maybe why the single player and coop campaigns will be good for some. as well as the arena mode.
[2022-12-19 21:24:30] <Satanizcool> guys my grade just came in for ece 350 and i got an A+ lets gooo

[2022-12-19 21:24:35] <Stebahno> @T_RAN pd2 is really good. I had a level 91 hardcore barb that I lost just about last week. So it's been Path of Exile for me lmao
[2022-12-19 21:24:37] <+composr> I played EVE for 10 years. I love Tarkov, but it is true that if you get behind in Tarkov, it really puts you at a huge disadvantage. And I truly don't have the time to put into the game. Wish I did
[2022-12-19 21:24:38] <Kayamannn> YES
[2022-12-19 21:24:39] <+opterios> @AK47GARRY Good point.

[2022-12-19 22:28:51] <%+CoseR6> blue screen normally means an essential piece is flawed. Check windows crash logger, see if it is a program function or a kernal error or something of the sort.

[2022-12-19 22:29:25] <+TERR0RC0RE> The bluescreen should have an error code?
[2022-12-19 22:29:26] <+dash5757> Sounds more like a Windows problem. Try reinstalling Windows
[2022-12-19 22:29:33] <+740ii> yeah check the logs/error code and figure out what driver is causing the bluescreen
[2022-12-19 22:29:33] <soldadab> start replacing the cheep parts 1st?

[2022-12-19 22:31:22] <%+jasp3rs> Simple answer is, clean it, apply new thermal paste, reinstall windows and install drivers and game only. If problem persists, then you're looking at possibility of hardware failure.
[2022-12-19 22:31:22] <%+mytharius> It can be everything. Need bluescreen code. I had to reinstall Windows, cause after some time update did some oopsie and my PC was randomly jumping with voltage to critical amount.
