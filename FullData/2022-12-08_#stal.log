[2022-12-08 08:53:50] <Farty_Pinder> the big complaint I've seen is, you do all the campaign and... you just think wait this is it? That's all?
[2022-12-08 08:54:03] <%$JoshCraze> Do they still have the auto ban?
[2022-12-08 08:54:05] <Farty_Pinder> you basically get story crumbs and a cliffhanger and that's it
[2022-12-08 08:54:09] <%$JoshCraze> If you get mass reported enough?
[2022-12-08 08:54:18] <%valfayr> idk why, in WoW i never had the feeling to want to explore
[2022-12-08 08:54:21] <%Makari> BUT HOWS EVERYONE <3?

[2022-12-08 08:55:56] <+Snargies> From my experience WoW was "rush to the end game" because they have endgame content that is time gated for end game gear. If you get a week behind, you're behind forever.
[2022-12-08 08:55:59] <%Keld__> I tried getting into LA a month ago but well

[2022-12-08 08:56:23] <Farty_Pinder> supposedly you can do endgame for free, but you have to replace the money with a very st omg dedication to the daily/weekly grind
[2022-12-08 08:56:45] <%+GraveyardBrawl> Stal no like lost ark?

[2022-12-08 16:54:22] <Narnun> yes chrono triggers is all about time
[2022-12-08 16:54:24] <@%Laww__> chrono means time

[2022-12-08 16:54:59] <%BowlingBobby> I bought Chrono Trigger for my phone and I stopped in the middle LuL I think I stopped in the part of the game with the post-apocalyptic zone
[2022-12-08 16:55:03] <ThermiThorus> it's very linear until endgame where you can choose where you wanna go

[2022-12-08 16:55:20] <ThermiThorus> you can only get the alternative endings after finishing the game once

[2022-12-08 16:56:12] <Narnun> there's I think a few endings that you can only get in new game +
[2022-12-08 16:56:22] <Narnun> depends on the missables and side quests you've done
[2022-12-08 16:56:28] <Narnun> a ton, like 18 or 22

[2022-12-08 16:56:46] <%Mista_Pink> Yeah, CT is godly
[2022-12-08 16:56:49] <%gama41> i would say play the game like you would normally
[2022-12-08 16:56:54] <%gama41> and if you want other endings you can go back to it
[2022-12-08 16:57:06] <Narnun> there's alot of characters and depending on the side quests you've done for each characters and time zone will affect a bit o the ending
[2022-12-08 16:57:09] <%+GraveyardBrawl> CT is really good. CC is also good imo. Might be a hot take. I dont remember many people loving it as much.
[2022-12-08 16:57:19] <Narnun> and then there are the decisions you make at the end of the game which decide the ending
[2022-12-08 16:57:30] <%Mista_Pink> Chrono Trigger takes 23 hours in total to beat. 43 to 100% the game
