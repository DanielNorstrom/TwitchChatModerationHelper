[2022-12-30 14:43:35] <smolrazz> Hi hens and chat!
[2022-12-30 14:43:35] <MergosWetNurse> people even DC vs trapper, sadako and shit @Hens333 did a few round of low tier killers yesterday and oh boy... just as many DCs
[2022-12-30 14:43:43] <%+almaWeeWoo> imagine doing the 4k t3 myers with no dc penalty
[2022-12-30 14:43:53] <sarangbaee> trapper is boring asf to verse imo
[2022-12-30 14:43:56] <komaprolurker> @eykre251 thats rough
[2022-12-30 14:43:58] <Southrobin> @almaweewoo please no
[2022-12-30 14:44:02] <%+ForestGrandpa> It takes around 1.2mil on average for one p50 when you take good quality addons
[2022-12-30 14:44:06] <%ClussyHonks> ok people moment of truth
[2022-12-30 14:44:13] <%ClussyHonks> no DC penalty
[2022-12-30 14:44:14] <%ClussyHonks> EZ
[2022-12-30 14:44:18] <Southrobin> @sarangbaee you rather vs nurses and blights 24/7 ?
[2022-12-30 14:44:24] <komaprolurker> Just bring Black ward on trapper no Perks or addons and watch them all dc
[2022-12-30 14:44:33] <pre_cut_corn07111> Trapper is fun to go against but freddy on the other hand... Yeesh
[2022-12-30 14:44:46] <MergosWetNurse> @komaprolurker already DC reason, black ward. you lost.
[2022-12-30 14:44:47] <sarangbaee> @southrobin I love blight! nurse is okay since the match will be over fast.

[2022-12-30 14:45:04] <K_Lite> i like freddy chases better than trapper tho

[2022-12-30 14:45:22] <Southrobin> @sarangbaee I guess you’d like my region then, let’s swap. Much prefer variety in my killers
[2022-12-30 14:45:23] <eykre251> why can't you change killers in the lobby with survivors?
[2022-12-30 14:45:36] <wizardphoenix> I think Wraith is the killer people DC the least against
[2022-12-30 14:45:39] <%+ForestGrandpa> I am bad, but not as bad as soloq people Yepge
[2022-12-30 14:45:56] <MergosWetNurse> @wizardphoenix wrong, I main him and there are many DCs
[2022-12-30 14:45:58] <%vladka_234> its also more fun for us to watch when you are playing with homies widepeepoHappy
[2022-12-30 14:46:02] <komaprolurker> you lost when you loaded up the game
[2022-12-30 14:46:03] <%Doctor_God> Maybe play wuthout comms and taking it a little easier
[2022-12-30 14:46:03] <%+Just_LuckeyGe> since I played a bit more swf I dont wanna solo q anymore
[2022-12-30 14:46:03] <wizardphoenix> @eykre251 because you'd have plague every time there is 3-4 medkits in the lobby
[2022-12-30 14:46:26] <Your_Stepdad> Does the trappers fastening tool escape time stack with his waxed brick add on?
[2022-12-30 14:46:31] <%+Just_LuckeyGe> tbh, I just throw for flashbangs
[2022-12-30 14:46:34] <wizardphoenix> @MergosWetNurse oh damn, maybe my MMR on wraith is too low for people to even consider DCing
[2022-12-30 14:46:35] <eykre251> @wizardphoenix makes sense
[2022-12-30 14:46:39] <Spectrobyss> @just_luckeyge SAME
[2022-12-30 14:46:40] <Southrobin> @just_luckeyge you have friends to swf with? :(
[2022-12-30 14:46:41] <%+ForestGrandpa> No, its not that. Its because killers have their own mmr *apparently* even if its not entirely true
[2022-12-30 14:46:42] <marwood_rs> is there a release day for the new clock video ?
[2022-12-30 14:46:48] <MergosWetNurse> I dont think it rly matters which killer you play... pissed people will DC anyways when a game doesnt go their way tbh...
[2022-12-30 14:47:05] <pre_cut_corn07111> Swf memery is the absolute best

[2022-12-30 15:34:38] <@%Ana1661> Hi Birdies peepoLovePink
[2022-12-30 15:34:43] <%Cairsoir> the only killer cheater I got was flying trapper with machinegun machete and he had amped up whatever perk trapper has that made skillchecks smaller, but his were super small and regressed lots on miss, he stood next to use while we worked for one gen for ages
[2022-12-30 15:34:43] <%+prized_1> @prized_1 ohhh like he has more perks than shown?

[2022-12-30 15:35:05] <%semplarr> what's the perk name, Relaxing Presence?
[2022-12-30 15:35:06] <Milo_lul> 100% cheating, ive seen the same thing back when people were flying when spectating
[2022-12-30 15:35:08] <%ObsidianLiger> he was injured
[2022-12-30 15:35:09] <%ClussyHonks> can someone answer me this? when the game is loading up for match - do the servers calculate the perks and powers or does it check for things in real time?
[2022-12-30 15:35:10] <qfrostqss> that nea also 4 percent of the hook in basement

[2022-12-30 16:27:52] <@%^Nightbot> Hens likes Hope because then he can take aggro in the end game and loop killers so tightly that they can't catch him, giving his team time to get to the gates and recover, etc. The speed boost allows him to bait the killer into making bad decisions, which wastes their time. Also, because no one runs Hope, killers don't expect it and they don't know how to play against it.

[2022-12-30 16:59:22] <Southrobin> @eviedudette that is true
[2022-12-30 16:59:28] <%+pribzz> when we do oni 1s it's genuinely trying to lose LOS and hide for as long as possible
[2022-12-30 16:59:36] <jacktheripperzx> big evan needs help

[2022-12-30 16:59:57] <detectiveshirogane> Do you think BHVR will ever buff Freddy? Seems a shame to have one of the biggest icons as considered weak AND unfun
[2022-12-30 16:59:58] <bnorky> im suprised slinger is A tier and huntress is B tier
[2022-12-30 16:59:58] <%ObsidianLiger> average oni hit tbh
[2022-12-30 17:00:00] <imkloon> nice hitbox
[2022-12-30 17:00:00] <%sam_vilderness> wow we have so many killers
[2022-12-30 17:00:00] <komaprolurker> hens old not young and hip
[2022-12-30 17:00:01] <$DanyR> HUH
[2022-12-30 17:00:21] <rock344> slingers op af in chases
[2022-12-30 17:00:42] <%Evolutioxn> do you think oni would be stronger if his power didn’t require you to absorb blood and it just passively gained overtime and there were add ons to get it faster? @hens333
[2022-12-30 17:00:44] <WarpedDragoon> Tier list looks different from when I saw it last. Are you constantly changing your mind
[2022-12-30 17:00:45] <+Theevanjellyion> too bad ppl only play 2 of them
[2022-12-30 17:00:48] <mightytwex> @bnorky slinger counters dead hatd
[2022-12-30 17:00:51] <mightytwex> dead hard
[2022-12-30 17:00:54] <%ZoopDoop_Games> @bnorky slinger is really good at countering endurance perks
[2022-12-30 17:00:55] <%+Jhifara> how close is Red Puke Plague in power level to Oni in power?
[2022-12-30 17:01:05] <%eviedudette> Deathslinger match maybe? hensPwease
[2022-12-30 17:01:05] <%+Fliperotchy> more killer = more bugs yay
[2022-12-30 17:01:10] <%+pribzz> 50 killers and i still play the same 3
[2022-12-30 17:01:15] <mightytwex> slinger please???
[2022-12-30 17:01:28] <%ObsidianLiger> they better buff oni when they bring out basekit BT
[2022-12-30 17:01:29] <%ZoopDoop_Games> addon value???
[2022-12-30 17:01:31] <celiaa_14> Weird question but, how do you get over the stress when playing killer? I always play one or two killer games a day because of how hard on my head it is
[2022-12-30 17:01:31] <+cuppykakes> i feel bad for new players it must be so overwhelming to level everyone
[2022-12-30 17:01:33] <%Evolutioxn> true

[2022-12-30 17:02:02] <%EarlyBirdiess> @celiaa_14 i also struggle with this hensPwease
[2022-12-30 17:02:05] <detectiveshirogane> Do you think Freddy would be better if he could manually put people to sleep like old Freddy?
[2022-12-30 17:02:08] <mightytwex> ooh I love ghost malone
[2022-12-30 17:02:32] <mightytwex> @detectiveshirogane personally I'd give him snares and pallets, like clown you can switch between the two
[2022-12-30 17:02:55] <%+Jhifara> @celiaa_14 A good thing to do is focus on specific parts of your game and ignore the larger game. Focus on your chase game or something simple and disregard the outcome
[2022-12-30 17:03:08] <%eviedudette> @Commander_Ray oh no, it'd be tremendously hard to survive against it hensDed
[2022-12-30 17:03:09] <%+Jhifara> after you get good at something then add something else on top
[2022-12-30 17:03:10] <%Kapalina> once I get adept on a killer, its just chill, even watching Megs tbagging their asses off is just so out of my interest 4Head but when Im trying to adept its just Madge 🔪
[2022-12-30 17:03:14] <celiaa_14> I'll keep that in mind, thank you guys peepoHappy
[2022-12-30 17:03:18] <komaprolurker> goodnight Chat and hens i enjoyed my stay as always
[2022-12-30 17:03:24] <%sam_vilderness> this is not good advice, but i play music while playing killer, it calms me down significantly. except spirit ofc
[2022-12-30 17:03:35] <+RoyFlynn> From my days playing RL and LoL I always just try to have a goal that I can't fail at.  For Oni, I would say "Today I am going to work on flicks, that's it"
[2022-12-30 17:03:48] <jacktheripperzx> indoor with ghostie , less go

[2022-12-30 17:06:26] <Ethan710717> do survivors also see the stalk amount or does only ghostface see it
[2022-12-30 17:06:31] <+matteriess> Hens have you experienced much server de-sync / rubber banding lately?
[2022-12-30 17:06:36] <thepyrogistinatorman> @Ethan710717 only ghostface
[2022-12-30 17:06:38] <Southrobin> @ethan710717 only ghosty
[2022-12-30 17:06:43] <Ethan710717> ok thx
[2022-12-30 17:06:55] <thepyrogistinatorman> but survivors can approximate the amount they've been stalked
[2022-12-30 17:06:57] <Southrobin> Leon why
[2022-12-30 17:07:19] <%Kapalina> Leon assessed their chances KEKW
[2022-12-30 17:07:23] <%+BarelyLive> i wish they turn off UK servers... I don't want to VPN to play the game normally...
[2022-12-30 17:07:23] <+matteriess> How can i prevent myself from connecting to the UK servers? Thanks again
