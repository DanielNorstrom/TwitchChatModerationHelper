[2023-01-05 04:27:21] <%+Fugeki> Haha probably because it was the biggest raid on that expansion
[2023-01-05 04:27:23] <LordGreatwolf> that was a blizzard before Activision
[2023-01-05 04:27:25] <%brickbandson> theyre elongating content instead of big releases
[2023-01-05 04:27:26] <Frannk3> tbf vault is the entry raid
[2023-01-05 04:27:28] <%Kabmoz> that boss on heroic on release (equivalent of mythic now) was a HUGE step in difficulty back then
[2023-01-05 04:27:29] <%ludcrow> is that the one with the giant chains ?
[2023-01-05 04:27:30] <%DJJIFFYJ> blizzard usually makes a really good raid every 2nd to 3rd major game update each expansion
