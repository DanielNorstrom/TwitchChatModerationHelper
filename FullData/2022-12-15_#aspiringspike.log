[2022-12-15 18:11:06] <idliketorespond> i disagree about norn being completely unplayable. It seems a good against a variety of decks and playable in omanth shells. It is completely unkillable by all relevant removal (soli, heat, binding) while shutting down titan, hammer, creativity, scam and omnath decks in very large degrees while giving you value off your own triggers. So while I am not saying its going to be all star, I wounldnt rule the card out so fast
[2022-12-15 18:11:27] <%+iwasphadf> @idliketorespond Dude its 5 mana

[2022-12-15 18:37:54] <+supreme_lurker> Are you including dlc?
[2022-12-15 18:37:58] <%codyjamesfs> Or is that just for speed runs?

[2022-12-15 18:46:15] <@%Marvoleath> @kentsuki13 Do they know what strategy games are? It is basically a strategy game with randomization, you have to manage resources and decide what actions to take.
[2022-12-15 18:46:16] <Nillarvis> @kentsuki13 Or present it as a generic board game pretty much, using cards as support is just here to add randomnes

[2022-12-15 19:17:32] <evanjmiller> @crazzevisions I was thinking the replicate is cool and all, but there aren’t that many decks in the meta that have that many artifacts in play at once. Even with hammer sometimes enchantments are more important.

[2022-12-15 19:17:40] <+Falke_BananaKing> elden ring you can jump off the cliff tho, no "hit"

[2022-12-15 19:50:59] <+TheJollyFlyingMan> You either run Temur for slogurk or you keep it Gruul so you can run Saga. in the Assault decks
[2022-12-15 19:51:00] <+TheJollyFlyingMan> imo
[2022-12-15 19:51:11] <+TheJollyFlyingMan> but Saga is kinda bad with RRR

[2022-12-15 20:10:36] <frondx> How about a Maelstrom Wanderer? (for the grindy matchup)
[2022-12-15 20:10:48] <Armater> but spike if fury was 4 mana it could be fatal pushed, would it still be better
[2022-12-15 20:10:49] <IAmTheSamsquanch> Would Serra Angel ber better if it were Avacyn The Putrifier
[2022-12-15 20:10:57] <forgeofdays> This deck needs shape anew
[2022-12-15 20:10:59] <+mayoveinsuwu> temur goodstuff aka 8bolt
[2022-12-15 20:11:02] <loveandmushrooms> Would ragavan be better if it had menace?
[2022-12-15 20:11:06] <+tankdunklin> would this deck be better with omnath in it?
[2022-12-15 20:11:31] <%Aper_MtG> @loveandmushrooms ragaban already has death touch player
[2022-12-15 20:11:38] <!%biits> wrenn + blood moon combo
[2022-12-15 20:11:38] <Goody_Phil> no attack with goyf is probably bolt
[2022-12-15 20:11:40] <%+420_blaiseit> F
[2022-12-15 20:11:41] <Goody_Phil> yup
[2022-12-15 20:11:44] <WhoeverTheHeckThatWas> Would Goyf be better if my opponent pinkey promised they wouldn't remove it?
[2022-12-15 20:11:59] <ltsJay> ggs? 🤝
[2022-12-15 20:12:03] <%Jabs1997> Died to temur list with goyf 😎
[2022-12-15 20:12:04] <+LionheartXIIIXII> rip
[2022-12-15 20:12:06] <$argentorum> notice how good their "brew" is when it just plays like murktide regent instead of futzing around with bad cards LUL
[2022-12-15 20:12:06] <Goody_Phil> love the stream :)
[2022-12-15 20:12:07] <Armater> "bad brew" just playing rug pile
