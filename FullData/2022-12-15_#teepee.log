[2022-12-15 18:22:02] <+pRotalitysChannel> @dyehardtryhard I don‚Äôt care who you have sympathy for or not. Just saying that was not a great comment in a public forumn.

[2022-12-15 18:22:06] <crab_butter> Hey, Teep, I‚Äôm trying to settle a bet. My friend says you hated Apex and think Warzone2 is just as good as Blackout. I told him you think WZ2 is worse than WZ1 and Blackout was way better. Do you actually hate Apex? I thought you liked it enough but WZ2 came out and since you‚Äôre a cod champion you went to that
[2022-12-15 18:22:07] <%+taughttoast> Thanks @omgcoffee
[2022-12-15 18:22:10] <%DaBeanieBaby> but for no reason other than a shooting that had nothing to do with the city. Got it @speardaddy12

[2022-12-15 19:23:10] <Kryptic_dg> the cluster mine should at least do high damage, just not instant down u
[2022-12-15 19:23:10] <%+fry_guy_24> Ahhh I gotcha
[2022-12-15 19:23:12] <mjohnson725> The second guy put the mines out when he crossed before you pushed.
[2022-12-15 19:23:19] <+djay7137> went from were not in trouble to... some trouble real quick
[2022-12-15 19:23:19] <%RavynNightstorm> unless second dude dropped it before you jumped out of the building maybe?  dunno
[2022-12-15 19:23:23] <+drewlunde11> and the guy just standing in the airstrike
[2022-12-15 19:23:23] <%JTW_4MyNinjas2> They weren‚Äôt inside a building so they didn‚Äôt hit. Lol
[2022-12-15 19:23:27] <+curtisgrows420> They may have placed them after the air strike
[2022-12-15 19:23:30] <%+aka_izz> Great game teepHype
[2022-12-15 19:23:40] <%thexrealness> they'll shoot through the buildings but not kill a mine

[2022-12-15 19:23:44] <%+j_montey2> like its is possible they implement skill based hit reg into every aspect of the game...i doubt it...but it feels that way alot
[2022-12-15 19:23:49] <+tonyj1821> only possibility is that he dropped the cluster when he crossed over to rez and your air strike was already gone

[2022-12-15 20:47:08] <%MikeyMase> True. As they get older carrying is more of a workout and going up and down stairs and shit.

[2022-12-15 23:45:55] <%+MrTacosOfficial> one thing that gets my fukcing goat is.. they made all these backwards changes from WZ1. there is a reason WZ was so popular. because it was divergent from other BRs in all the best ways. where other brs slowed things down, they said "lets speed things up" but then it is like they all got memory loss drugged between wz1 and wz2
