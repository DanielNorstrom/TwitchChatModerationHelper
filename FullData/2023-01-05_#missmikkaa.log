[2023-01-05 16:13:36] <@%Sleipur> Cheer100 A messer (German for "knife") is a single-edged sword with a knife-like hilt. While the various names are often used synonymously, messers are divided into two types: Lange Messer ("long knives") are one-handed swords used for self-defence.[1] They were about a meter long and may have evolved from the Bauernwehr ("peasant's sidearm"). They are also known as Gro√ües Messer ("great knife").

[2023-01-05 21:04:08] <%+grymzol> NGL, that sounds kinda like serial killer talk. I don't like my kill, it wasn't graceful enough, haha

[2023-01-05 21:04:26] <%VampireNoxArt> I would say the timing is fine. Any discrepancy is caused by each game reacting slightly differently to you and your movement and attacks. A 60 second window is easily understandable.

[2023-01-05 21:09:00] <I_HANDLE_THAT> Could you give some detail about your strategy you have followed? For me it seems you attacked in one game while doding in the other. Which makes sense because go full attack mode in both games would be pretty tough even with boss like multi tasking skills
