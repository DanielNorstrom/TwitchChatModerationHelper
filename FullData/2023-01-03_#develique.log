[2023-01-03 11:45:13] <@%YellowBanana69> cant have an office without a coffee machine
[2023-01-03 11:46:18] <@%YellowBanana69> Automated because no room in the budget for a full-time barista
[2023-01-03 11:46:43] <@%Kwampi> I mean if you ever are, sign me up
[2023-01-03 11:47:05] <@%Kwampi> I wanted to do a barista course but told they are a waste of money but I think i'm going to do one anyway.  I want to get back into hospitality
[2023-01-03 11:47:41] <@%YellowBanana69> I got out of hospitality and into customer service and now im in software eng

[2023-01-03 11:48:24] <@%Kwampi> I was out of work for ages cuz of my arthritis.  Trying to get back into it with hospitality experience and just business qualifications is hard af

[2023-01-03 12:21:52] <%Landy> hahaah you know old school speed cameras only maxed out at 210km or omsething like that, so you could go fast enough to NOT be caught
[2023-01-03 12:21:57] <!%uzimerce> nah didnt lol was looking out for cars and cameras
[2023-01-03 12:22:02] <%seethingaardvark> I guess they deploy them only when someone tries to break the land speed record.

[2023-01-03 14:06:26] <@%jayzke> no idea actually
[2023-01-03 14:06:29] <%+UmbralLuna> The song is featured in several TV shows and films including: About Time, I Could Never Be Your Woman, Chuck, Surviving Jack, About Time, Regular Show and iZombie. The track is the main theme song used in the 2009 film He's Just Not That into You.[5]  In 2004 Soundtrack of 50 First Dates with Dryden Mitchell of Alien Ant Farm.  In the video game Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain, "Friday I'm in Love" appears as both an in-game cassette tape and an anachronism
