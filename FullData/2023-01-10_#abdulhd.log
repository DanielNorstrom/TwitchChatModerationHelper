[2023-01-10 00:07:35] <@%^StreamElements> @SAMOXID with Twitch Turbo you can support your favorite streamer even if you're not subscribed to them!! If you are not a subscriber and have a Twitch Turbo you won't see any ads on any twitch channel and still count into ad revenue for the streamer! So imagine how much you can support your favorite streamer just by having Turbo!! twitch.tv/turbo

[2023-01-10 00:31:17] <+kartinamusic> its not exactly "higher" FOV, but its farther away from the character, its 2 Settings. Helps with visibility/preference

[2023-01-10 23:24:53] <+Liam_BM> I agree. This story isn't really about good or evil, but more about how choices can affect the way you behave. Some streamers I watched quit the game as soon as they had to play as Abby which I think is a shame
