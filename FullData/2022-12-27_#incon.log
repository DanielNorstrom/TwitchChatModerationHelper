[2022-12-27 19:37:53] <%Lordlud> also after this game we have 4 spots for an stl lobby?! ehhh incon?????
[2022-12-27 19:37:56] <%+acraine1> @itsreef3 Its the furthest away from fg. Harder to defend that lane and have 5 for a an fg fight
[2022-12-27 19:38:01] <@%^StreamElements> Buy your gems and videogames here and support the twitchiest community(All Platforms) https://www.nexus.gg/incon/in-game-content
[2022-12-27 19:38:13] <%Danger_Corpse> If you decide to defend the lane then you have a much further path to get to the FG and vice versa.
[2022-12-27 19:38:22] <+itsreef3> @acraine1 appreciate that!

[2022-12-27 22:25:25] <voicemanager> i do totally think that part of antiheal being so easy and accessible is from flexibility of no more boots

[2022-12-27 22:32:40] <+UncleOblivion> yup have definitely hit scylla 3 with the awilix ult before didn't expect it but felt great
[2022-12-27 22:32:55] <%Debaucherous> @itzJET You can't get pulled in Iza unless you are VERY unfortunate. You're invisible so she can't target you
