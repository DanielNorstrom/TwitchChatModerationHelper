[2022-12-07 12:49:25] <+kevmeteor> yea even non effective tera still do more
[2022-12-07 12:49:29] <+VirtueUK> Yeah a Tera non-SE move is better than a normal SE for breaking raid shields
[2022-12-07 12:49:39] <+030xemre> what pokemon is strong against poison?
[2022-12-07 12:49:41] <+actualratrat> 90% feels like 50% every single time
[2022-12-07 12:49:44] <PaulyGames> Does anything think its possible they will fix the Frame issues or do you think its just a hardcoded flaw?
[2022-12-07 12:49:47] <+merglemang> its an odd mechanic even if a different move does more the terra boosted move does more to the shield
[2022-12-07 12:49:49] <%Ktizila> this is it, this is the one

[2022-12-07 14:05:56] <%lits0h> Taunt means attacking moves only

[2022-12-07 14:06:58] <+blankthesupport> how to do it when there is an outbreak? auto battle 30-60 times then picnic spam?

[2022-12-07 14:07:06] <@%fabriisio> @WhiteAdonisSky i wasnt here wtf this means
[2022-12-07 14:07:07] <%+VirtueUK> I can bring Grimmsnarl to next attempt. Prankster taunt it, then Light Screen, then lower his Sp.Atk to 0
[2022-12-07 14:07:16] <%Dokkeshi> I thought it was fire my bad
[2022-12-07 14:07:26] <%lits0h> You can either picnic or just walk away until they despawn
[2022-12-07 14:07:30] <%lits0h> Whichever is faster
[2022-12-07 14:07:36] <@%fabriisio> ariaHmm
[2022-12-07 14:07:36] <%+VirtueUK> I can taunt him first so he can't taunt you
[2022-12-07 14:07:36] <%+Sensibwaay> its chance
[2022-12-07 14:07:37] <%lits0h> Best one is if the outbreak is next to a town boundary
[2022-12-07 14:07:43] <%lits0h> You can reset it way faster
[2022-12-07 14:07:53] <%lits0h> Taunt lasts multiple turns though
[2022-12-07 14:07:53] <%+VirtueUK> Gimme 1 sec to get my Grimmsnarl ready
[2022-12-07 14:08:13] <venomenal829> what u eating?
[2022-12-07 14:08:16] <%lits0h> So if you get taunted turn 1 then it's in effect for a while
[2022-12-07 14:08:24] <%+Sensibwaay> taunt makes you only use attack moves only, so doesnt matter which move you start with
[2022-12-07 14:08:31] <%+sseldogfps> i have a few eeveelutions that i dont want so if anyone wants one i can give them away

[2022-12-07 14:16:26] <Slyphical> It's just certain pokemons has a chance to drop all 5 of the herbs.
[2022-12-07 14:16:30] <+ThatTickleZ> not sure but when I get those specific mons I get at least 2.

[2022-12-07 14:20:07] <%+sseldogfps> i didnt get a shiny eevee from 1500 eggs T.T
[2022-12-07 14:20:07] <%+Sensibwaay> it was tested and confirmed, but it does not guarantee... you have have a lot of pokemon in one area and if it also appears in adjecent areas it have bigger chances.. thats why it takes a while to get Eevee oubreak because it only spawns in a few squares
[2022-12-07 14:20:08] <%markpygas> That's a lot of shinies damn
[2022-12-07 14:20:08] <Slyphical> Also if you want, there's a strat where you can 1 shot charizard in 3-4 turns with azu that is fairly consistent with a team, then you can make your azu the star of the show :)
[2022-12-07 14:20:28] <%lits0h> I can scream tail it

[2022-12-07 15:20:45] <%+VirtueUK> Or does that only work in towns
[2022-12-07 15:20:56] <%lits0h> Town boundaries only

[2022-12-07 15:22:34] <%+Sensibwaay> their blue eyes acatually pop out so its easy to see them
[2022-12-07 15:23:09] <timbres> But the electric tadpole is the worst imo

[2022-12-07 15:24:00] <%+Sensibwaay> yeah the tadbulb is hard
[2022-12-07 15:24:14] <%+VirtueUK> @Tarikws Outbreaks
[2022-12-07 15:24:32] <+ThatTickleZ> mine was brown shiny tatsugiri
[2022-12-07 15:24:33] <Tarikws> oh diddnt know
[2022-12-07 15:25:06] <Slyphical> Shiny tauros probably quite hard too
[2022-12-07 15:25:09] <+ThatTickleZ> would love to find a white one tho more rare
[2022-12-07 15:25:16] <timbres> 3 different shinies and 1 of the shinies looks like the normal version of a different one LUL

[2022-12-07 15:25:22] <Slyphical> Its a darker shade of black
[2022-12-07 15:25:24] <Slyphical> I think
[2022-12-07 15:25:36] <Azxiel79> Shiny frigibax and watrell is quite difficult
[2022-12-07 15:25:38] <%+Sensibwaay> there is a trick to spotting tauros.. since it changes texture of their body you just look if it reflects like on the sides. if not its shiny
[2022-12-07 15:25:42] <shi1oh> Shiny tauros is pretty noticible in a pack tho
[2022-12-07 15:25:56] <arcanepug> @ThatTickleZ ooof that's the hardest one to spot right? good job!
[2022-12-07 15:26:04] <+Dalty> For frigibax the giveaway for me is the dangly bits on it's arms.
[2022-12-07 15:26:26] <timbres> Tadbulbs missing from your shinies found
[2022-12-07 15:26:29] <%+VirtueUK> Hardest shiny to spot is Shinx ok
[2022-12-07 15:26:29] <%lits0h> For me it was the fin on its back
[2022-12-07 15:26:42] <%+VirtueUK> Very subtle colour change
[2022-12-07 15:26:43] <Azxiel79> I dont even realize its shiny until i spam auto battle lol
[2022-12-07 15:27:00] <Azxiel79> The harsest one is mausehold
[2022-12-07 15:27:01] <+Dalty> Slowpoke is a pure menace too.
[2022-12-07 15:27:02] <%+Sensibwaay> yea its tiny
[2022-12-07 15:27:07] <Azxiel79> Almost impossible lol
[2022-12-07 15:27:14] <Tarikws> Tatsugiri has orange form thats brown shiny but the shiny yellows shiny is also orange
[2022-12-07 15:27:14] <%+Sensibwaay> moushold is the hardest probably
[2022-12-07 15:27:14] <+sheeeshballs> hardest shiny to spot maybe a shiny gengar?
[2022-12-07 15:27:15] <timbres> PepeLaugh

[2022-12-07 15:27:26] <shi1oh> its shirt changes barely lol
[2022-12-07 15:27:27] <%+VirtueUK> Jesus yeah Maushold is tiny different
[2022-12-07 15:27:27] <+totalllytom> maushold has no change, their little clothes change colour
[2022-12-07 15:27:29] <timbres> Screw the maushold shiny
[2022-12-07 15:27:29] <MartiMcFly> The belly is a bit darker on the mousehold
[2022-12-07 15:28:01] <Azxiel79> Ikr no effort lol

[2022-12-07 15:28:09] <+ThatTickleZ> @ThatTickleZ yeah wish it was white tho. would match my shiny dondozo
[2022-12-07 15:28:13] <%lits0h> Could have just make it a black mouse and be done with it
[2022-12-07 15:28:15] <timbres> Have you seen Rellor's shiny? its pog
[2022-12-07 15:28:17] <+knightseas0n> They do it on purpose just to mess with people LUL
[2022-12-07 15:28:20] <Tarikws> i do think that auto battleing every pokemon is still faster tahn eggs
[2022-12-07 15:28:20] <%+VirtueUK> Because then the game couldn't be forced out within 9 months of their last release ok
[2022-12-07 15:28:20] <%+Sensibwaay> it goes from super light blue shirt and pants to super light brown shirt and pants
[2022-12-07 15:28:21] <mintlinter> i was hunting slowpoke and ended up finding a shiny gyarados and flamigo instead
[2022-12-07 15:28:25] <+Dalty> It's the shirt on the male and the pants of the female that change, it's so minimal
[2022-12-07 15:28:31] <+totalllytom> never try to overworld hunt a shiny tauros OMEGALUL
[2022-12-07 15:28:44] <arcanepug> they could make one of the mouse different color, it would be so cute
[2022-12-07 15:28:57] <Azxiel79> Next gen shiny would probably have no different the the original
[2022-12-07 15:29:20] <@%fabriisio> what are the jimmies telling you aria? pausecham is it coming?
[2022-12-07 15:29:20] <%+VirtueUK> They're gonna remove shinies and replace it with a gimmick where their cries are slightly different or some bs

[2022-12-07 15:29:56] <+totalllytom> NOPERS I did get 2 shinies in a horde back in X and Y though and I could only catch one of them
[2022-12-07 15:30:08] <%+VirtueUK> 60+ kills, shiny charm, sparkling lvl 3 so not insane odds

[2022-12-07 15:32:47] <%+VirtueUK> Legit get one per minute, even less
[2022-12-07 15:33:10] <+totalllytom> @lits0h you could go into someone else's game and try hunt. Youd only get like 1 or 2 every couple of minutes and it would be way too long but thats the only way you could

[2022-12-07 15:55:44] <%Atmosity> Does shiny charm help the odds for eggs, too? Or just wild spawns?
[2022-12-07 15:55:50] <mintlinter> ive hunted about 10 shinies while hatching so not too bad lol
[2022-12-07 15:55:58] <$jothepoet> I got shiny eevee after three egg
[2022-12-07 15:55:59] <%+Sensibwaay> masuda seem to be the worst shiny method in this game
[2022-12-07 15:56:03] <Slyphical> It makes it 1/512 odds with masuda and shiny charm
[2022-12-07 15:56:09] <+Hulgwun> im at the last league tourney and not one shiny at all :')
[2022-12-07 15:56:11] <Azxiel79> Im still kn my 500 ans here i thought i m in pain lol

[2022-12-07 15:56:27] <+dekuangel7> I remember for a perfect stat charmander took about 600 eggs hatched celiDown
[2022-12-07 15:56:33] <%lits0h> You're def at 60 now
[2022-12-07 15:56:38] <%lits0h> That was the message
[2022-12-07 15:56:42] <%+NxKuuro> after i get charmander i need to get 2 eevees cus i want shiny umbreon and my favorite shiny Sylveon
[2022-12-07 15:56:52] <mintlinter> the worst bit about shiny hunting charmander is sometimes the lighting in game makes it look shiny :(
[2022-12-07 15:57:07] <Azxiel79> Just got my shiny glimmet on 23 minute of sandwich lol
[2022-12-07 15:57:10] <timbres> My longest hunt was soft resetting for a shiny fossil in Sword/Shield, like 2000+ resets
[2022-12-07 15:57:15] <a_moonlighter> I've lost track on how many charmander eggs I've hatched celiDown
[2022-12-07 15:57:20] <%lits0h> Yeah them you forsure know you ko'd at least 60

[2022-12-07 16:18:32] <xgrimzzx_> never
[2022-12-07 16:18:36] <%+VirtueUK> This game? It'll have a resurgence at Christmas and then slowly die out after like a month
[2022-12-07 16:18:36] <shi1oh> its too big to fail at this point
[2022-12-07 16:18:36] <CalmAlm> 10 uears
[2022-12-07 16:18:37] <+GhoulyGG> until the next one
[2022-12-07 16:18:42] <%TopTitz> yeah past christmas
[2022-12-07 16:18:45] <%kyle_lm> Pokemon doesnt rly die but the viewers rly fall off like by start of next yr
[2022-12-07 16:18:52] <%kyle_lm> Like it will be steady for a bit
[2022-12-07 16:18:54] <mfpow1> oh u mean THIS game, i thought u meant the entire pokemon franchise
[2022-12-07 16:18:54] <katyjaja> i thought it already died? isnt everyone plaing wow now?
[2022-12-07 16:18:54] <%kyle_lm> Then fall
[2022-12-07 16:18:58] <%HKAdam> specific pokemon games it really varies
[2022-12-07 16:18:58] <%atomchoco> you can come back to it but you cant keep doing it
[2022-12-07 16:19:02] <iTsLyonA> after I beat this game I went back and I'm playing Legends of Arceus
[2022-12-07 16:19:02] <NorthWestDork> they need to fix the online battling andor add battle tower
[2022-12-07 16:19:07] <shi1oh> DLC coming next year tho
[2022-12-07 16:19:09] <%+Sensibwaay> pokemon games have a really long lifespan, but after a while it stops being mainstream and mostly pokemon focus creators still make content about it
[2022-12-07 16:19:11] <%+NxKuuro> pokemon home is coming in a few months so i assume after national dex
[2022-12-07 16:19:14] <CalmAlm> dlc
[2022-12-07 16:19:14] <@%fabriisio> pokemon is life
[2022-12-07 16:19:14] <+iAmZeGinger> depends what youre doing with the mons. if you play competitve, it will go for a few months at least
[2022-12-07 16:19:20] <%HKAdam> streamers it doesnt last nearly as long but I know peeps who will play the same pokemon game for years
[2022-12-07 16:19:20] <CalmAlm> so 2 years then
[2022-12-07 16:19:22] <%Ktizila> hei i am nearly 40 !!!!

[2022-12-07 16:19:44] <+ST_Turtle> ok can I rant about pokemon? I miss the days of having a mean rival not like a bff rival. Also I wish each game was standalone new pokemon instead of all of them in one
[2022-12-07 16:19:48] <%+Sensibwaay> the pokemon community is still going strong
[2022-12-07 16:19:52] <katyjaja> Wow as well
[2022-12-07 16:20:02] <%HKAdam> its definitely not dead twitch just has low attention span and needs new lol
[2022-12-07 16:20:09] <%+VirtueUK> OW, Apex, Val, League, all those titles will always bring people back because of the infinite replayability, but those games are soul-crushing to me
[2022-12-07 16:20:15] <@%fabriisio> i feel like valo is a game that people will always go back

[2022-12-07 17:46:42] <%+VirtueUK> False swipe must be the move to bring it down, otherwise other moves can kill
[2022-12-07 17:46:45] <%MegaRayquaza__> capture it Madge
[2022-12-07 17:46:50] <%Sparemaple> only false swipe wont kill
[2022-12-07 17:46:50] <+totalllytom> use false swipe only until its 1
[2022-12-07 17:46:50] <%+kazamasta31> false wipe will never drop it below 1 so you can use it multiple times
[2022-12-07 17:46:56] <midnightballad> Sylveon is 75% male so getting a female would be hard
[2022-12-07 17:47:01] <ryusaiii> however... trans flag colors
[2022-12-07 17:47:05] <ares886> you need to power level you false swiper

[2022-12-07 17:47:14] <DankCadenza> false swipe just puts it to a minimum of 0, any other effect can still tick that last 1 hit
[2022-12-07 17:47:16] <%Sparemaple> its 87.5% male

[2022-12-07 17:48:03] <ryusaiii> you could say it's a trans man sylveon
[2022-12-07 17:48:05] <codestruct> Like all Eevee-derived Pokémon, Sylveon has a gender ratio of seven males to just one female.
[2022-12-07 17:48:15] <+FreeXe> ooh it appeared during the ad I missed it Sadge
[2022-12-07 17:48:22] <%HKAdam> that 87.5 reminded me of resetting to get my female starter NotLikeThis

[2022-12-07 17:52:05] <KatSpins> Any tip for getting a shiny?, I just can´t find one
[2022-12-07 17:52:21] <%+VirtueUK> @KatSpins Increase your odds where possible, and have patience

[2022-12-07 17:52:58] <+FreeXe> Why do you want a female one?
[2022-12-07 17:53:14] <%zorg666> outbreak + shiny charm + sandwich is the best way to find shinys by far
[2022-12-07 17:53:22] <+themegapikachu> women >men FreeXe
[2022-12-07 17:53:23] <KatSpins> Ohh i see, thanks Aria
[2022-12-07 17:53:33] <+FreeXe> @themegapikachu words
[2022-12-07 17:53:45] <+iAmZeGinger> If you find a shiny Sylveon would you trade it for a shiny charmander?
[2022-12-07 17:53:57] <+Luilas_0520> The best way to get shinies is by using sparkling power from sandwiches+shiny charm+ ko 60 pokemon from an outbreak. gives you a 1/512 chance
[2022-12-07 17:54:08] <Piccolombone> if you have scarlet, you can eat a ghost encounter sandwich then go to the bottom of area zero during daytime and all that spawns is shiny flutter mane
[2022-12-07 17:54:26] <%+VirtueUK> 1/512 chance with 15+ spawns every 20 seconds. Rapid shinies

[2022-12-07 17:58:38] <%+VirtueUK> You're basically at full odds to find a Female shiny Sylveon btw. Unless I'm wrong, it's 1/4096 @AriaSaki
[2022-12-07 17:59:06] <%zorg666> @Luilas_0520 frequentist statistics are commonly misused, but I still wouldn't call them useless
[2022-12-07 17:59:12] <%Sparemaple> full odds for it to be female
[2022-12-07 17:59:13] <Grrizzzly> Sooo next month another Japan trip?!?
[2022-12-07 17:59:14] <%+VirtueUK> It's 8x more likely to find a male one
[2022-12-07 17:59:18] <+totalllytom> its 1/2048 since 25%*1/512
[2022-12-07 17:59:18] <%+menacing> because 1/512 for the shiny x 1/8 for the female
[2022-12-07 17:59:20] <+Bimb0b__> masuda method goated just got shiny shroomish on my second egg
[2022-12-07 17:59:30] <+totalllytom> are you 8x more likely to find a male?

[2022-12-07 17:59:36] <%+menacing> @totalllytom its 12.5% not 25%

[2022-12-07 17:59:56] <%zorg666> COPIUM it is still 8x better than the normal odds for a female shiny

[2022-12-07 18:00:28] <+Luilas_0520> @Bimb0b__ insanely lucky on that one my friend masuda method is still like 1/680 or so

[2022-12-07 18:05:30] <@%jojoppa> and especially bring them into japan
[2022-12-07 18:05:39] <@%fabriisio> true nodd
[2022-12-07 18:05:39] <@%jojoppa> could take over a year
[2022-12-07 18:05:48] <@%fabriisio> peepoS a year
[2022-12-07 18:05:51] <@%jojoppa> and all the stress for the pets as well
[2022-12-07 18:06:01] <Grrizzzly> And those lovely cats are worth the time
[2022-12-07 18:06:15] <@%fabriisio> i don't think you got his point ICANT
[2022-12-07 18:06:17] <WeirdFeels> and they have to learn a new language
[2022-12-07 18:06:29] <Grrizzzly> People move cats will get used to it
[2022-12-07 18:07:01] <@%jojoppa> still dont get my point
[2022-12-07 18:07:10] <@%jojoppa> you are stressing out the pets
[2022-12-07 18:07:21] <Grrizzzly> So
[2022-12-07 18:07:27] <+Prototype132lbs> lmfao
[2022-12-07 18:07:55] <Grrizzzly> Stress is temporary
[2022-12-07 18:07:59] <%Sparemaple> pugSit
[2022-12-07 18:08:16] <+SpoilersWTF> wipe them out, all of them!
[2022-12-07 18:08:18] <@%jojoppa> again you still dont get it
[2022-12-07 18:08:29] <@%jojoppa> so its pointless on continuing
[2022-12-07 18:08:34] <@%fabriisio> nodd
[2022-12-07 18:08:40] <@%neelerita> ... LOL you clearly have no idea how delicate pets are my dude. pipe down. Stress in pets is not a one day thing. it's a constant anxiety of being in a completely new place with all 5 senses.
[2022-12-07 18:08:40] <codestruct> nodd
[2022-12-07 18:08:42] <Grrizzzly> Agree to disagree

[2022-12-07 18:10:49] <codestruct> Just different school of thoughts (probably). Pet owners typically give it a serious thought on the adverse impact on their pets before moving (which then become a consideration factor as well)
