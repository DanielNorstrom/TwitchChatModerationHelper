[2022-12-15 17:03:29] <%EagleFalcon> you think they'd call it something less eye brow raising... like the fun chamber, or the screw with squall hall.
[2022-12-15 17:03:30] <@%Neobullseye> Yeah, they tried to go for the more euphemistic "Interrogation room", but it didn't fit in the space.
[2022-12-15 17:03:38] <%stalkor> Why is there a golduck in this game
[2022-12-15 17:03:39] <@%Neobullseye> So "Torture Room" it was!
[2022-12-15 17:04:05] <%stalkor> Turtle room

[2022-12-15 17:06:24] <@^Nightbot> For Final Fantasy 8 Fiesta play, Players may only equip 1 GF (Guardian Force) per character at any given time.
[2022-12-15 17:06:30] <%+weegee5120> Depends. Where I'm at in the US, once October hits, you don't see the sun for 5 months.

[2022-12-15 17:07:14] <%+ReimHikari> hu?! squall actually flies?
[2022-12-15 17:07:45] <%neSTea_D> man oh man, this game brings back memories.  Look at all those pixels
[2022-12-15 17:07:55] BITS: Neobullseye (111)
[2022-12-15 17:07:55] <@%Neobullseye> Cheer111 Meanwhile, in two separate and slightly different universes, Squall ever so slightly misjudges his leap and either fell into the abyss or cut Zell in two.
[2022-12-15 17:08:36] BITS: EagleFalcon (214)
[2022-12-15 17:08:36] <%EagleFalcon> Muxy214 fixed it
[2022-12-15 17:08:53] <%EagleFalcon> yes
[2022-12-15 17:08:57] <%EagleFalcon> no
[2022-12-15 17:09:02] <@%Neobullseye> That's... not fixing it though.

[2022-12-15 17:10:47] <%+ReimHikari> oh lmao, kitase said in one interview that he liked the dead squall theory a lot, so they may consider it for a remake if that happens in a future LUL
[2022-12-15 17:11:06] VIEWERS: 569
[2022-12-15 17:11:14] <+Fuerutar> oh man I missed a lot of FF8
[2022-12-15 17:11:43] <+TheRedFox_GG> was 8 remastered? is this that version or not using that one?
[2022-12-15 17:11:51] <%+ReimHikari> it would be funny if at least was a possibility on the table
[2022-12-15 17:11:57] <@%Neobullseye> Anyway, I'm off. Cya!
[2022-12-15 17:12:11] <%CynniUniflame> I hope not, people don't die from an icicle in their shoulder.

[2022-12-15 17:14:46] <%schablam> i feel like i hear a cool horn or brass instrument in this version
[2022-12-15 17:14:57] <%schablam> a nice low subtle one
[2022-12-15 17:15:18] <%schablam> maybe it was just 7 humming along

[2022-12-15 17:16:06] <%schablam> ha
[2022-12-15 17:16:32] <%EagleFalcon> Clips, Tiktok, trends, and about how squall isn't the most handsome guy in the room in the remaster
[2022-12-15 17:16:41] <%CynniUniflame> I just looked it up. And I remember why the squall is dead theory irks me. The icicle goes throught the right shoulder. Heart is on the left side. There is no way
[2022-12-15 17:17:31] <%+ReimHikari> LUL
[2022-12-15 17:17:34] <%CynniUniflame> suuuuure XD
