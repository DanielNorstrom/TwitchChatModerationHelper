[2022-12-11 14:20:31] <Grenalolz> Ok, here's a topic for you : Do you think Tarzan was a virgin before he met Jane or did he beat gorilla cheeks ?
[2022-12-11 14:20:36] <%Faladryn> @di5loxia now I have a long distance relationship so not so often I can spend time with my bf Sadge

[2022-12-11 14:20:46] <%Naruto11k> it was bad imo, but somewhat funny
[2022-12-11 14:20:47] <%+irondefender4> I think it was bad that it happened. It was disrespectful and ruined the moment imo
[2022-12-11 14:21:02] <personalindividual> Too bad it happened in Elden Ring s panel
[2022-12-11 14:21:10] <personalindividual> True

[2022-12-11 14:27:48] <%+cirillios> Do you track the overall views for all channels on a specific game? I wonder if the overall twitch viewership for FromSoft games is just dropping as the Elden Ring hype kind of fades for the typical viewer

[2022-12-11 14:28:49] <Castillo77> An idea could be to involve more the viewers in choosing what weapons to to a run with or something like that. Also have u tried Sekire yet?

[2022-12-11 14:37:36] <lorisdmc> did u skip the tree boss ?
[2022-12-11 14:37:42] <%+snaxxer> Yea thats why i just wanted to bring the idea up, if that might be some sort of "Addon", twitch could provide for Streamers. Its not something that is already available.
[2022-12-11 14:37:43] <%LtMurloc> @lorisdmc yesss
[2022-12-11 14:37:48] <!%TurtleArmyJess> One streamer I watch has a 30 second "welcome to the stream" vid that she plays every time there's a raid. Maybe something like that?
[2022-12-11 14:37:50] <!%noxifoxi> the problem is that only I was for my part really sick the last 2 weeks, heavy depression and now I have a cold, sore throat. its a really tough november/december for me. And rapho is very busy PepeHands @dinossindgeil

[2022-12-11 14:40:33] <%+snaxxer> @a_chu Its more about a little Intro to show yourself and your content off in a short but accessible way. Its not about telling people everything about you.

[2022-12-11 14:42:22] <@%a_chu> @snaxxer I just look through the profile and if there is not a lot I watch a bit or start talking to the streamer. If there would be an intro about who the streamer is and what not I'd feel like it's more of a job interview.

[2022-12-11 14:49:30] <@%a_chu> @snaxxer and technically it is. You want the streamer to have an introduction to the viewer, which they do have with their profiles, but what they write in it is up to them. Even with an introduction video like that it probably won't solve your predicament. The only solution is to stafor a while and get to know the streamer in the end
[2022-12-11 14:49:31] <%+snaxxer> @a_chu this is actually excactly the way i am not. And that is why my "idea" was referring to what Nico said about people not following him very quick but instead watch him some time before doing so. i myself did follow this Channel quite fast when i first came here. =)

[2022-12-11 14:51:04] <@%a_chu> @snaxxer I mean you literally said, and I'm quoting you directly here " I just feel i have to watch a Streamer for quite some time before i kinda get to know the style of the Stream...which ppl tend not to do i guess." FeelsWeirdMan
[2022-12-11 14:51:07] <%+snaxxer> @a_chu right, and my take on that "introduction-video" would be more like a lil compilation of what is happening over a Stream in here.... some hitless moments, some Meme, maybe some Dinos on screen, idk. more like a mashup of what you  could enjoy here.

[2022-12-11 14:58:49] <%FabioSpoto> Hi Nico
[2022-12-11 14:58:59] <Skyfin____> this world cup had like some of the best games in a very long time aslo so its a struggle
[2022-12-11 14:58:59] <%Nexaron_dragonbite> btw is it just me or any1 else think that argentina losing to katar was simply bought match?
[2022-12-11 14:59:05] <!%TurtleArmyJess> @vlvdimirovnv try going to a sports bar during the match?
[2022-12-11 14:59:07] <%+snaxxer> @a_chu well maybe it feels different to me then. The vibe in other hitless channels of the FromSoftware Community is quite different if you ask me. Even if quite some people of this channel are there too
[2022-12-11 14:59:09] <Skyfin____> it was to saudi arabia or what do you mean @Nexaron_dragonbite
[2022-12-11 14:59:30] <%$originalgengar> it's probably because germany got kicked out very early but it does seem a lot quieter in terms of world cup than usually LUL
[2022-12-11 14:59:34] <%Nexaron_dragonbite> @Skyfin____ maybe i didnt watch it XD but argentina losing to them isnt normal

[2022-12-11 15:06:59] <%DanTopTier> @dinossindgeil I don't know if this will work for you, but Bawkbasoup will begin the stream and have it sit for several minutes before he begins talking to the stream. Then, he will sit and talk to the chat for 30-60 minutes before ever playing a game. This is to stall while viewers trickle in at the beginning. I wonder if something similar will work for you
