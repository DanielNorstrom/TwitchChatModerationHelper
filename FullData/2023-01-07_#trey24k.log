[2023-01-07 03:53:06] <%+iPh3NoM> @iPh3NoM @luminarysolar right, but does it kill you or is damage increase only bad side effect?
[2023-01-07 03:53:07] <%$BuckyNastyy12> i gues the 5.0 was ok
[2023-01-07 03:53:10] <%deadfallingstars> @Vbrandonv the most mid cars in america lmfaoo

[2023-01-07 04:43:20] <%yuhyuhyuh23> I think if they reverted the recoil but kept inertia and all that it would be good

[2023-01-07 04:44:20] <%+CaptainFreezey> Inertia? that's like when your character skids to stop movement?

[2023-01-07 04:44:23] <%Woadsberg> I literally hate inertia

[2023-01-07 04:44:38] <%+Desha_Shep> @turtlewiener nah dawg I really think Inertia killed it for me. It just hasn't been the same sense. Afterwards, yea I will agree the 12.12 updates fucked it.
[2023-01-07 04:44:39] <%ntkm_> @CaptainFreezey movement impacted by weight :)
[2023-01-07 04:44:39] <yvngbosh47> does he have face reveal?
[2023-01-07 04:44:40] <%$judeab_> i played tark when they just added inertia so i dont know what it is pre inertia
[2023-01-07 04:44:43] <%$judeab_> but i think inertia is good
[2023-01-07 04:44:46] <OpaHroTaH> Why are they poking their noses inside the car like that
[2023-01-07 04:44:49] <$3Spooky> i think the removal of camera recoil and a revamp of inertia would be hugely good
[2023-01-07 04:44:55] <%Slayforpay> He is going to hand her a meth pipe instead of insurance 90% chance
[2023-01-07 04:44:57] <%prettycooldude420> "i had it in here earlier" = aint no mf insurance in the car

[2023-01-07 16:55:15] <$Freporuni> If it's 2% spawn chance, you have to do 50 customs raids to find him once?

[2023-01-07 18:54:15] <%SteremyJeele> It costs that much because insurance companies will pay it, so the prices for services keep going up.

[2023-01-07 18:57:29] <NashEquil> USA had a marginal income tax of 80% in the 1980's on income over like 200k
[2023-01-07 18:57:30] <thewaterdude1> it's a lot better than paying 100k for college

[2023-01-07 22:08:29] <seven0seas> antisocial is like being drunk in public
[2023-01-07 22:08:29] <+Vix_99> it's when you dont go the pub after work
[2023-01-07 22:08:29] <+DuchDuckBooze> its basically disrespect for authority
[2023-01-07 22:08:30] <eolanp> Blanket term for public disorders
[2023-01-07 22:08:30] <+BigchewyGaming> So like disturbing the peace type of stuff

[2023-01-07 22:08:33] <+letsgetbent> its just like being a fucking nusance shouting at people and being a dick to everyone
[2023-01-07 22:08:34] <lewsmonaghan2305> swearing
[2023-01-07 22:08:34] <+barkzy_> @Trey24k its kind of a collective term, noise disturbances, drunk n disorderly etc
[2023-01-07 22:08:34] <+DuchDuckBooze> not fitting into the social norms
[2023-01-07 22:08:36] <joyfulko> its like when you masturbate in public and so on
[2023-01-07 22:08:39] <%+calculatedv2> probably not talking to the cops or helping them out
[2023-01-07 22:08:39] <shiabalboa> but they have places for homeless people with food water toilet and a bed but on the next morning they need to get out
[2023-01-07 22:08:39] <shamrockac> in europe OUR homeless heroine addicts dont believe in jesus! stupid americans!
[2023-01-07 22:08:43] <%CatPizzzza> If you can’t do a backflip on command you’re not behaving normally

[2023-01-07 22:08:57] <eolanp> yup
[2023-01-07 22:08:57] <seven0seas> nah its being a dick to others
[2023-01-07 22:09:00] <geishaboy500> Any reason umbrella term
[2023-01-07 22:09:01] <%P4tSajak> DTP
[2023-01-07 22:09:01] <seven0seas> yes public disturbance

[2023-01-07 22:09:06] <+BigchewyGaming> No it fits
[2023-01-07 22:09:06] <+Tuner1810> antisocial in the uk is not willing to drink tea
[2023-01-07 22:09:07] <Aaaaarrgh> asocial =/= antisocial
[2023-01-07 22:09:12] <+dramherst> Probably just disorderly conduct
[2023-01-07 22:09:14] <!%ethan8855> It seemed like a catchall phrase for anything like disorderly conduct, anything from drinking to yelling to fighting to shoplifting. Seemed very vague to me
[2023-01-07 22:09:14] <+El_mambri> @shamrockac our homeless are better, dont be salty, it's just a fact
[2023-01-07 22:09:16] <%CardiacArrest__> EU makes no sense at all
[2023-01-07 22:09:18] <+letsgetbent> in the uk it doesnt really mean that its just specifically the one offense
[2023-01-07 22:09:22] <+superdbk> like drunk and disorderly
[2023-01-07 22:09:27] <%$whitexcdghk> antisocial as against the "well-being" of society, less of social life
[2023-01-07 22:09:29] <%+RaiderSheen> they call it breach of the piece

[2023-01-07 22:23:46] <$FlavoredOxygenTV> not true. there are limits to what you can say
[2023-01-07 22:23:52] <dbarss> define rudeness tho, can be a lot of different types of rudeness. they probably only take the kind of rudeness that makes a cause of something to happen
[2023-01-07 22:23:53] <$FlavoredOxygenTV> you can absolutely be arrested
[2023-01-07 22:23:54] <%RolledByRobbe> what was that sound?
[2023-01-07 22:23:55] <%SteremyJeele> Only if it's inciting violence.
[2023-01-07 22:23:57] <+BigchewyGaming> If your speech insights violence it is
[2023-01-07 22:24:00] <+barkzy_> i guess at least the UK doesnt have mass school shooting, Id take being arrested for rudeness kekw
[2023-01-07 22:24:06] <IIMuchII> yes, in the us if you call someone a slur you can definitely be arrested for a hate crime
[2023-01-07 22:24:10] <%snowman2314> @ggwp123ttv get yo mouth checked ugly ass, sucking on every other guys dick
[2023-01-07 22:24:14] <%+joeymagic18> threating violence is a crime in many states in the US
[2023-01-07 22:24:16] <DreamtBlue> You can get in legal trouble for inciting violence against someone in US or even general panic

[2023-01-07 22:24:43] <$FlavoredOxygenTV> inciting panic is absolutely an arrestable offense
[2023-01-07 22:24:44] <%oxLeTHaL> my guess is the morons in chat saying you can get arrested are referring to terroristic threats. not hate speech.
[2023-01-07 22:24:44] <%may__bee_> @Trey24k cant shout fire to incite a panic at a theater when there is no fire for example
[2023-01-07 22:24:48] <masEafy> @FlavoredOxygenTV thats not free speach thats public disturbance

[2023-01-07 22:25:12] <+dakotafra> @iimuchii that is not a hate crime, a hate crime is singling someone out based on their color or religion.

It works against the aggresive listener who needs info and it works against sneekers. EFT audio is in favor of ambushers thats it.

[2023-01-07 22:57:29] <@%^StreamElements> I've been dedicating my days to watching him grind to level 70. He is a god-tier labs player and has been effortlessly farming raiders and chads for weeks. I respect the grind. With that said after hearing him say my name, I feel so full, I don't need to eat for 7 days. I write down the time and day of when he says my name. I will wait a year, and celebrate the anniversary of when he said my name by donating again. The day that he stops streaming will be the day I stop breathing.
