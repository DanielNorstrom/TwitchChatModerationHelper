[2023-01-04 17:19:36] <@%$Apparentthreat> orangecreamsicle3 Player file could have gotten corrupted or something during that process. Why I was hoping a backed up version could recover it. but at least with our automation getting the stuff back won't be unbearable.

[2023-01-04 17:49:15] <N3rvrackD> you searched for FLO, not FLU
[2023-01-04 17:49:19] <Wazepas> In the liquid terminal you searched "florine" not "fluorine"

[2023-01-04 17:50:36] <luthal_> are you gonna play this until you finish the pack or are you on a time limit?
[2023-01-04 17:50:48] <kitty_cat20> why not use the same fluid interface with fluid filters?
[2023-01-04 17:50:48] <R1Rider01> why so many fluid connectors?  can't 1 handle like 10 fluids and then you use a filter at the machine?
[2023-01-04 17:50:56] <%banshay3> why are you using toothpaste on your uranium?
[2023-01-04 17:50:56] <%$Tro95> PTFE production is using most of the fluorine, you need to change the priorities

[2023-01-04 18:43:29] <%+LiveType> @Razorain56 The p2p tunnels can only do a single connection so 32k rf per p2p while the end steel cables can do the same so it makes no sense to use p2p here.

[2023-01-04 19:32:45] <InoUno> You'll need a machine to produce each kind of item then, right?
[2023-01-04 19:33:07] <Amenophiz> Question, if you have a full drawer and some on the drive and you use part of the drawer inventory will it relocate the drive inventory to the drawer ?
[2023-01-04 19:33:09] <%+Askjong> Doesn't draws lag?
[2023-01-04 19:33:13] <+Alamose> can even used the 2x2 drawers to store less if you dont want 2k

[2023-01-04 19:34:13] <+Wolframpage> there are downgrade upgrades also can allow you to store less than 2048 items
[2023-01-04 19:34:23] <+primo_qwe> or you can use storage downgrade + iron storage upgrade too easier to adjust
[2023-01-04 19:34:42] <+TheRiehlDeal> Cobble upgrade
[2023-01-04 19:34:43] <+primo_qwe> storage downgrade
[2023-01-04 19:34:48] <Ras2709> flint or cobble
[2023-01-04 19:34:58] <jayrickson87> downgrade it's made of flint
[2023-01-04 19:35:01] <+Orkrist13> could be a later version

[2023-01-04 19:35:04] <%lazyhot> There is also storage downgrade so on a 4by4 downgraded you can storage rly low amount
[2023-01-04 19:35:05] <%mrleonehart> You are searching wrong for downgrade

[2023-01-04 19:36:01] <+Alamose> it changes the base value, so 2x the base now

[2023-01-04 20:32:01] <%$mobfarmer> the pack is fine, doesn't need a big system, but achieving the goals of the quest book requires building 1000's of machines, such a layout requires a large computer to complete.
[2023-01-04 20:32:10] <%Protonmat> this is a heavy pack tho

[2023-01-04 20:38:48] <Minelmonia> the red ingot is wrong i think? its copper dust not ingot
[2023-01-04 20:39:07] <+The_V_88> I believe so indeed.. Red alloy is not running
[2023-01-04 20:39:28] <kane1941> so put it low prio?
[2023-01-04 20:39:28] <%Trsg_craig> no it uses the lowest first
[2023-01-04 20:39:29] <+dennis3833> no it will fill this first
[2023-01-04 20:39:31] <kolbias_13> Upgrade the drawer?
[2023-01-04 20:39:43] <%Trsg_craig> it uses lowest priority first
[2023-01-04 20:39:45] <%+ondorin> you can set the storage bus to one directional i think
[2023-01-04 20:39:48] <%chaoskub> fills highest, uses lowest
[2023-01-04 20:39:54] <kaasrondje> Uses lowest
[2023-01-04 20:39:56] <+dennis3833> lesser prio fill fill the higher prio
[2023-01-04 20:39:57] <+stickman_02> it stores in the 5000 but takes from the 3000
[2023-01-04 20:40:00] <%Trsg_craig> it will store at thr highest

[2023-01-04 20:41:20] <hyperion6767> red alloy is fine
[2023-01-04 20:41:40] <weightmaker> items will take from highest prio first. Fluids will take from lowest.

[2023-01-04 20:41:53] <Minelmonia> doest it not have to be dust? as opposed to ingot?

[2023-01-04 20:59:44] <coolcake2> @Giantwaffle the fact that he could play all the games with his PC is honestly impressive
[2023-01-04 20:59:51] <Saishu_> in the end he switched to a discounted mobo and cpu combo
[2023-01-04 20:59:54] <rawbits> mine is Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-4570 CPU @ 3.20GHz + 16 Gigs DDR3

[2023-01-04 21:00:37] <gikei> because it's java. Most games don't get bottlenecked by cpu
[2023-01-04 21:00:41] <%OrangeW2> streaming NVENC is probably saving his ass

[2023-01-04 22:34:04] <+TheNamlit> @giantwaffle maybe double the amount of ingots stored in the drawer, so that when you take stuff like rods, sheets, gears etc. out of the system, it has a safer/larger buffer…else you might run out of ingots again (like right now)
[2023-01-04 22:34:12] <AleXanDreMau> @Giantwaffle does the server Restart daylie? maybe has a memory dump!

[2023-01-04 22:41:06] <+Deamp> the question is, is it more lag friendly to do this with level emitter instead of drawer/controller/storagebus-combination

[2023-01-04 22:41:52] <%Littleme02> presumably
[2023-01-04 22:41:58] <+Deamp> just read something that you should not use a lot of storagebus-drawer combinations with a lot of drawer

[2023-01-04 23:03:45] <Flobu_> but wafle you refused to automate the circuits at least on small scale and insists on doing it 20 times manually
[2023-01-04 23:04:05] <Cleaveyu> Can't believe he said meh to satisfactory while helping to build a factory :O

[2023-01-04 23:31:16] <%TigerLuv> that said nickel
[2023-01-04 23:31:19] <$kbigLiar> double check that all the drawers have the stack downgrade in them? Cuz that hover isn't gonna tell
[2023-01-04 23:31:23] <+KingPuller> 256 would be 32 Stacksize
[2023-01-04 23:31:25] <%Littleme02> isn't a normal stack 64?
[2023-01-04 23:31:29] <BMYGRLFRND> 8*32 is 256

[2023-01-04 23:31:58] <lukasalbert> i think base is 32
[2023-01-04 23:32:01] <%Littleme02> try taking it ouit
[2023-01-04 23:32:08] <lukasalbert> and you reduced it to 1 times 8
[2023-01-04 23:32:14] <+tragic_dan> If you hover over the drawer it’ll say the gear number x stacks - x8 that means it’s 8 stacks
[2023-01-04 23:32:16] <$kbigLiar> Didn't you miss the downgrade in the invar drawer?
