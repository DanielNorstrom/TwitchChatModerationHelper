[2023-01-03 11:49:22] <@%$Catmeleon> I mean if you get a modern TV it doesn't have a receiver so you don't need a license
[2023-01-03 11:49:31] <+henners01> Yeah just dont watch anything via satellite, netflix and consoles will be fine, if they knock just dont let them in because they have no legal right to come into your home

[2023-01-03 11:59:07] <%massamsa> Madge no litering
[2023-01-03 11:59:09] <%Benisz> The Sleep Council recommends replacing your mattress as often as every seven years, because after that time it will have been subjected to more than 20,000 hours of use. That’s the equivalent of 2,555 nights, which is a lot when you consider that adults lose an average of half a pint of fluid each night, and shed a pound of dead skin cells each year.
[2023-01-03 11:59:11] <%Sir_Raids> just call your local recycling center and said that you want to get rid of mattress

[2023-01-03 14:34:34] <doomroxar4> yeah needs a rewatch
[2023-01-03 14:34:36] <%Swequn> There ain't nothing guilty about the first pirates movie
[2023-01-03 14:34:38] <%Benisz> it is once a year rewatch type of movie
[2023-01-03 14:34:42] <Yomii95> its just classic
[2023-01-03 14:34:42] <@%$Catmeleon> plus it stars the famous innocent actor Johny Depp
[2023-01-03 14:34:43] <%JarofNutella_> @Lakshata I recommend the book, its fantastic.

[2023-01-03 14:35:05] <%Swequn> Past 3rd is a bit guilty yeah
[2023-01-03 14:35:11] <dcccxliilegion> Shaun of the dead is the best zombie film Kapp
[2023-01-03 14:35:11] <%+Thiago_IHF> 3rd feels like an ending so it's fine for me
[2023-01-03 14:35:15] <+ineedtheszechuansauce> the 3rd one is pretty mid tbh. but 1 and 2 are great
[2023-01-03 14:35:17] <%JarofNutella_> Should do a watch along one day on some of these films.
[2023-01-03 14:35:19] <%Ziiltch> I like post.apocalyptic stuff, but im tired of it being either war or zombies
