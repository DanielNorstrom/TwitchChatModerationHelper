[2023-01-09 00:00:01] <!%yelnaX> when soda became a vtuber for a couple of days, I started getting vtubers recommended on youtube
[2023-01-09 00:00:09] <!%yelnaX> I had to delete those channels asap
[2023-01-09 00:00:16] <%trolsopol> OMEGALOOOOL

[2023-01-09 00:00:23] <%trolsopol> youtube algorythm is too much
[2023-01-09 00:00:39] <!%yelnaX> thats why I have chatterino set up so it opens links on incognito
[2023-01-09 00:00:51] <%trolsopol> i once looked at a cooking video from uncle roger, now get reccomended like 10248257 cooking stuff

[2023-01-09 00:02:06] <%trolsopol> unless it's very few people and i can chat to the streamer
[2023-01-09 00:02:13] <%$inoe182> its just for background noise
[2023-01-09 00:02:18] <%$inoe182> like what i said earlier
[2023-01-09 00:02:19] <%trolsopol> but when chat is going like crazy NoThanks
[2023-01-09 00:02:30] <%trolsopol> background noise for me is usually music
[2023-01-09 00:02:31] <%$inoe182> when sing done streaming
[2023-01-09 00:02:37] <%trolsopol> or some tv-series

[2023-01-09 00:05:53] <%trolsopol> good chat interaction is important NODDERS you can't grow channel without your viewers
[2023-01-09 00:06:04] <%trolsopol> sing is super good at this, even when playing game he still interacts
[2023-01-09 00:06:15] <%trolsopol> only dota is differnet cause requires 100% concentration
[2023-01-09 00:06:28] <%$inoe182> but ofc the reason i liked her freetalk is because shes indonesian living in indonesia KEK

[2023-01-09 00:38:04] <%trolsopol> OHH
[2023-01-09 00:38:14] <%$inoe182> basicaly monopolized the economy of a server on a game

[2023-01-09 00:38:47] <%$inoe182> but the devs stopped to care abt their game
[2023-01-09 00:38:53] <%$inoe182> not devs actually
[2023-01-09 00:38:57] <%$inoe182> the indonesian publisher
[2023-01-09 00:39:11] <%$inoe182> they didnt protect their game
[2023-01-09 00:39:20] <%$inoe182> basically just a corupt company
[2023-01-09 00:39:31] <%$inoe182> so when cheater attacked, we cant do anything
[2023-01-09 00:39:46] <%$inoe182> even 1 of my guildmate got banned by em
[2023-01-09 00:39:56] <%$inoe182> he even go to their office in jakarta
[2023-01-09 00:40:04] <%$inoe182> and hired some lawyer
[2023-01-09 00:40:10] <%trolsopol> banned by cheater ?
[2023-01-09 00:40:12] <%trolsopol> HUHH

[2023-01-09 00:40:18] <!%kmzia> !cast
[2023-01-09 00:40:19] <@%Skwishi> kmzia has snapped their line and got nothing. Try again later
[2023-01-09 00:40:19] <megolduck> CouldYouNot
[2023-01-09 00:40:25] <%$inoe182> they accused my guildmate
[2023-01-09 00:40:28] <%trolsopol> OhISee
[2023-01-09 00:40:36] <%$inoe182> grinding using bot
[2023-01-09 00:40:47] <%$inoe182> when basically he always played by himself
[2023-01-09 00:41:18] <%trolsopol> Unluck
[2023-01-09 00:41:28] <%$inoe182> so basically he always GAMING after school
[2023-01-09 00:41:42] <%$inoe182> for like 3-6h at the internet cafe
[2023-01-09 00:41:59] <%$inoe182> basically farmed quest material to get his fame upgraded
[2023-01-09 00:42:09] <%$inoe182> because he already reached max lvl at that time
[2023-01-09 00:42:37] <@%Cetkaman> trolsopol, oh yeah this guy sometimes streams with cam, sometimes with his model and has around half of a braincell so i like to watch him okey https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uy5eF9YullE
[2023-01-09 00:43:29] <%trolsopol> HUHH this is ome some channel with 12 subs ?
[2023-01-09 00:43:41] <@%Cetkaman> nah, its just a reupload
[2023-01-09 00:43:55] <@%Cetkaman> the original version does not have the saxophone in it xdd
[2023-01-09 00:44:01] <%trolsopol> OhISee
[2023-01-09 00:44:10] <@%Cetkaman> im retarede dont mind me Okayeg
[2023-01-09 00:44:12] <%$inoe182> so basically my guild opened a gameboosting service / lvling service and we fought for hunting area everytime they did maintenance
[2023-01-09 00:44:22] <%$inoe182> basically the rules is : first come first serve
[2023-01-09 00:44:24] <%trolsopol> PepeLaf it's ok me regarded too
[2023-01-09 00:44:47] <@%Cetkaman> thats the channel, but he streams on twitch witht the same name https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPghBomVlSM
[2023-01-09 00:44:52] <%$inoe182> well u know when theres some kind monopolizing stuff
[2023-01-09 00:44:57] <%$inoe182> some ppl got jealous
[2023-01-09 00:44:59] <%$inoe182> n stuff
[2023-01-09 00:45:45] <%$inoe182> even when we already shared the schedule for hunting in that area equally
[2023-01-09 00:46:02] <%$inoe182> because ofc we always prioritizing our own guild member
[2023-01-09 00:46:50] <@%Cetkaman> that sounds cancer actually PepeLaf guilds monopolyzing areas to sell lvling
[2023-01-09 00:46:59] <%trolsopol> sounds like a pretty good deal NODDERS
[2023-01-09 00:47:07] <%trolsopol> but if you're not in the guild it sucks
[2023-01-09 00:47:31] <%trolsopol> this reminds me of EVE online
[2023-01-09 00:47:39] <%trolsopol> where guilds fight and buy stuff with real money
[2023-01-09 00:47:45] <%$inoe182> @Cetkaman the area is big and u can form 1 party with 6 ppl in it
[2023-01-09 00:47:49] <%trolsopol> and make loads Paid
[2023-01-09 00:48:10] <%$inoe182> so u can fit like 18 ppl at one time
[2023-01-09 00:48:19] <%$inoe182> 18 ppl ./ 3parties
[2023-01-09 00:48:38] <%$inoe182> at that area got the highest moster lvl
[2023-01-09 00:48:51] <!%kmzia> CATCAVEMAN
[2023-01-09 00:48:53] <%$inoe182> so no ppl with low lvl can use the area
[2023-01-09 00:48:59] <%$inoe182> unless they r cheating
[2023-01-09 00:49:15] <@%Cetkaman> oh so solo players dont really get cucked by it Hmm not so cancer than PepeLaf
[2023-01-09 00:49:18] <%$inoe182> thats when the problem started

[2023-01-09 00:52:08] <%$inoe182> @Cetkaman oh this game got no pvp mode at that time
[2023-01-09 00:52:28] <%$inoe182> so we cant freely attack ppl
[2023-01-09 00:52:33] <@%Cetkaman> i could barely understand english then so im not sure what went on in there KEK
[2023-01-09 00:52:33] <%$inoe182> unless u r a cheater

[2023-01-09 00:53:11] <%$inoe182> basically turned their normal map
[2023-01-09 00:53:14] <%$inoe182> to pvp map
[2023-01-09 00:53:16] <%$inoe182> to hit ppl
[2023-01-09 00:53:18] <%$inoe182> smhmyhead
[2023-01-09 00:53:41] <@%Cetkaman> my friends played a game like that but cant remember the name
[2023-01-09 00:54:02] <@%Cetkaman> basically you could cheat to hit people and give yourself infinite attack range
[2023-01-09 00:54:13] <%$inoe182> ye its the usuall mmorpg shit stuff KEK
[2023-01-09 00:54:44] <%$inoe182> and the cheater keeps getting better n better at cheating
[2023-01-09 00:55:00] <%$inoe182> they can even combine 2 skill from different job to their character
[2023-01-09 00:55:11] <%$inoe182> like warrior wearing a shield
[2023-01-09 00:55:16] <%$inoe182> and doing long range attack
[2023-01-09 00:55:35] <%$inoe182> its so bizzare
[2023-01-09 00:55:40] <@%Cetkaman> so they just 1 shot people from across the map and laughed at them
[2023-01-09 00:55:49] <@%Cetkaman> as fucking 7-8 years old shits like they were

[2023-01-09 00:57:28] <%$inoe182> and the problem is the corrupt gamemaster can only ban em
[2023-01-09 00:57:34] <%$inoe182> when theres a report
[2023-01-09 00:57:40] <%$inoe182> then some ppl did some false report

[2023-01-09 00:58:57] <%$inoe182> which is
[2023-01-09 00:59:01] <%$inoe182> duplicating item
[2023-01-09 00:59:12] <%$inoe182> by restarting the server using some bug

[2023-01-09 01:23:41] <!%kmzia> okey
[2023-01-09 01:23:41] <%$inoe182> i just did some google abt it
[2023-01-09 01:23:48] <%$inoe182> it similar to the stuff here
[2023-01-09 01:23:55] <!%kmzia> its thai street food
[2023-01-09 01:24:04] <!%kmzia> the most popular one
[2023-01-09 01:24:09] <!%kmzia> next to pad thai
[2023-01-09 01:24:11] <!%kmzia> okey
[2023-01-09 01:24:20] <%$inoe182> basicaly just dice-sliced chicken mixed with dice-sliced fried tempe, then stir-fried it with some herb
[2023-01-09 01:24:32] <!%kmzia> i see
[2023-01-09 01:24:40] <%$inoe182> put some salt + sweet soy sauce
[2023-01-09 01:24:50] <%$inoe182> and sliced chilli if u like spicy
[2023-01-09 01:25:07] <!%kmzia> but the iconic of that is thai basil
[2023-01-09 01:25:15] <!%kmzia> giving out a special flavour
[2023-01-09 01:25:21] <%$inoe182> like mint?
[2023-01-09 01:25:21] <!%kmzia> and smell too
[2023-01-09 01:25:29] <%$inoe182> kinda spicy right?
[2023-01-09 01:26:00] <!%kmzia> yeah
[2023-01-09 01:26:03] <!%kmzia> very
[2023-01-09 01:26:34] <%$inoe182> ye
[2023-01-09 01:26:39] <%$inoe182> my mom usually use that
[2023-01-09 01:26:49] <%$inoe182> for stir-fried fried catfish
[2023-01-09 01:27:07] <%$inoe182> basically at first u need to fry some catfish
[2023-01-09 01:27:16] <%$inoe182> with some seasoning
[2023-01-09 01:27:26] <%$inoe182> then u double cooked it with basil
[2023-01-09 01:27:28] <%$inoe182> singTasty
[2023-01-09 01:27:53] <%$inoe182> fav stuff
[2023-01-09 01:28:36] <!%kmzia> try braise it
[2023-01-09 01:28:38] <!%kmzia> like
[2023-01-09 01:29:07] <!%kmzia> idk but my homemade braised fish is different to what you can find in auth viet food
[2023-01-09 01:29:15] <%$inoe182> catfish meat doesnt need to be braised
[2023-01-09 01:29:19] <%$inoe182> the meat already soft
[2023-01-09 01:29:28] <%$inoe182> didnt stick into the bone
[2023-01-09 01:29:42] <!%kmzia> but braise it giving out more flavour
[2023-01-09 01:29:47] <%$inoe182> unless u fried it wrong way
[2023-01-09 01:29:56] <!%kmzia> Hmm

[2023-01-09 03:11:51] <!%kmzia> 2.5 for a bottle
[2023-01-09 03:11:57] <@%Cetkaman> they are always more expensive then normal stores and have less stuff
[2023-01-09 03:11:59] <!%kmzia> everything is so expensive now
[2023-01-09 03:12:38] <@%communistwizard> Idr how much it cost when I came here
[2023-01-09 03:12:43] <@%communistwizard> I think it was like $2 or $2.5
[2023-01-09 03:12:57] <@%communistwizard> for a can
[2023-01-09 03:13:06] <@%communistwizard> err bottle
[2023-01-09 03:13:17] <!%MisterMonsieur> you guys still pay for bills at a store? HUHH
[2023-01-09 03:13:38] <@%communistwizard> in rural parts of japan you can
[2023-01-09 03:13:44] <@%communistwizard> at a convenience store
[2023-01-09 03:14:01] <@%communistwizard> like where my mom's family lives
[2023-01-09 03:14:07] <@%communistwizard> there's only mountains and rice paddies there
[2023-01-09 03:14:08] <@%communistwizard> JerryKEK
[2023-01-09 03:14:23] <!%MisterMonsieur> @communistwizard yeah but this HUHH
[2023-01-09 03:14:52] <@%communistwizard> I mea n
[2023-01-09 03:14:57] <@%communistwizard> how else do you expect them to pay bills there
[2023-01-09 03:14:58] <@%communistwizard> JerryKEK
[2023-01-09 03:15:10] <C0ldtaco> instead of konbinis you go to corner stores in sydney where you buy chips Okayeg
[2023-01-09 03:15:29] <@%communistwizard> @C0ldtaco expensive and they suck
[2023-01-09 03:15:42] <@%communistwizard> @MisterMonsieur i think only one of my aunts has a smartphone
[2023-01-09 03:15:44] <@%communistwizard> to put it into context
[2023-01-09 03:15:48] <@%communistwizard> JerryKEK
[2023-01-09 03:15:56] <!%MisterMonsieur> JerryKEK
[2023-01-09 03:15:58] <C0ldtaco> they are like a few bucks for a pack of fresh hot chips with chicken salt what more do you want
[2023-01-09 03:15:58] <@%communistwizard> oh and one ipad
[2023-01-09 03:16:46] <C0ldtaco> its great when you are a broke high school student Okayeg
[2023-01-09 03:16:56] <@%communistwizard> @C0ldtaco I mean when I lived in japan
[2023-01-09 03:17:10] <!%MisterMonsieur> @C0ldtaco assuming you're not broke now Okayeg
[2023-01-09 03:17:14] <@%communistwizard> I could just go down the road and get a proper meal for <500 yen
[2023-01-09 03:17:15] <@%communistwizard> JerryKEK
[2023-01-09 03:17:44] <C0ldtaco> chips and chicken salt is basically a proper meal you have condensed chicken in the chicken salt COPIUM
[2023-01-09 03:17:48] <@%communistwizard> get some ramen, soba, gyudon or whatever
[2023-01-09 03:18:07] <@%communistwizard> or I can survive off konbini food for a while too
[2023-01-09 03:18:11] <C0ldtaco> youre right tho never noticed the weird lack of konbinis here
[2023-01-09 03:18:28] <C0ldtaco> tobacco shops probably outnumber konbinis especially in the city
[2023-01-09 03:18:28] <@%communistwizard> there are konbinis here but they are god awful
[2023-01-09 03:18:32] <@%communistwizard> probably too awful to call one
[2023-01-09 03:18:44] <C0ldtaco> theres coles and wollies express Okayeg
[2023-01-09 03:18:46] <C0ldtaco> you can buy meals there
[2023-01-09 03:18:48] <!%kmzia> i member
[2023-01-09 03:18:55] <!%kmzia> 10 dollar can get you a full meal
[2023-01-09 03:19:02] <!%kmzia> not like 10 dollar for a single item like this
[2023-01-09 03:19:06] <@%communistwizard> now it's like $15
[2023-01-09 03:19:16] <@%communistwizard> sadE
[2023-01-09 03:19:36] <C0ldtaco> i got a woolies sushi roll for 13$ yesterday
[2023-01-09 03:19:53] <!%MisterMonsieur> my wage, 1 hour = 1 meal Aware
[2023-01-09 03:19:55] <@%communistwizard> sushi is expensive as hell in sydney
[2023-01-09 03:20:07] <@%communistwizard> and they're all god awful
[2023-01-09 03:20:17] <@%communistwizard> most of the time I only make my own
[2023-01-09 03:20:17] <C0ldtaco> it really is fucking expensive
[2023-01-09 03:20:19] <@%communistwizard> JerryKEK
[2023-01-09 03:20:32] <@%communistwizard> unless I plan to go to a proper restaurant
[2023-01-09 03:20:32] <C0ldtaco> fuckign salmon prices are through the roof now too
[2023-01-09 03:20:53] <@%communistwizard> I get some fresh salmon from the market tbh
[2023-01-09 03:20:58] <@%communistwizard> much cheaper there
[2023-01-09 03:21:04] <C0ldtaco> same but its more expensive than it was a year ago
[2023-01-09 03:21:08] <@%communistwizard> yeah it was
[2023-01-09 03:21:12] <C0ldtaco> its nearing 60$/kg for sashimi grade stuff
[2023-01-09 03:21:15] <C0ldtaco> Sadge
[2023-01-09 03:21:17] <@%communistwizard> last year or so it was like $18 per kg for me there
[2023-01-09 03:21:22] <@%communistwizard> but now it's probably twice that
[2023-01-09 03:22:29] <@%communistwizard> sydney is just too expensive
[2023-01-09 03:22:39] <@%communistwizard> and the quality iisn't great tbh
[2023-01-09 03:23:06] <C0ldtaco> i think 1mil for an apartment is fine Okayeg
[2023-01-09 03:23:39] <C0ldtaco> indian foods great for the price tho
[2023-01-09 03:23:43] <C0ldtaco> if you go food courts
[2023-01-09 03:23:47] <C0ldtaco> could get a feed for like 14$
[2023-01-09 03:24:23] <@%communistwizard> most places around me are more expensive
[2023-01-09 03:24:29] <@%communistwizard> for indian food that is
[2023-01-09 03:24:42] <C0ldtaco> where are you
[2023-01-09 03:24:48] <C0ldtaco> care to dox Okayeg

[2023-01-09 09:34:32] <%Atmosphere_rh> i am also confused, if dudes are watching these streams to get off, why won't they just watch porn?
[2023-01-09 09:34:51] <%Atmosphere_rh> and if not, who is the target audience of these streams?
[2023-01-09 09:35:14] <%trolsopol> porn is banned in many places
[2023-01-09 09:35:20] <%trolsopol> this is closest they can get for free
[2023-01-09 09:35:24] <@%julliant> I guess cause they have specific taste for appearances
[2023-01-09 09:35:36] <%trolsopol> also weird kinks as julliant says
[2023-01-09 09:35:38] <%Atmosphere_rh> nothing is truly banned on the internet, it is a matter of will
[2023-01-09 09:35:48] <%Atmosphere_rh> okay i see the kink point
[2023-01-09 09:36:31] <benedict___> kink point addition of parasocial jerking off
[2023-01-09 09:36:55] <@%julliant> You want that kpop look with enhanced features but you dont get that on pornhub or jav
[2023-01-09 09:37:01] <%$inoe182> @Atmosphere_rh theres a korean stream about a guy and girl doing some punishment game, he slapped her BOOBA using slippers

[2023-01-09 20:58:29] <!shuraba_> it's taught in the second grade, I still remember trying to learn the difference KEK
[2023-01-09 20:58:31] <%suxexile> then the remaining Nordic countries just seem to emerge after Scandia splitting or something Hmm
[2023-01-09 20:58:33] <!shuraba_> "why does this even matter"
[2023-01-09 20:59:11] <%suxexile> then there's that thing where Finnish people were once under the Swedes, until they became their own
[2023-01-09 20:59:25] <%suxexile> YEPP Scandinavia just getting complicated as usual
[2023-01-09 20:59:33] <!shuraba_> you forgot a century of russian occupation
[2023-01-09 20:59:39] <!shuraba_> Despair

[2023-01-09 21:00:19] <%suxexile> time to say cyka blyat over there PepeLaf
[2023-01-09 21:00:52] <!shuraba_> lenin actually granted us independence
[2023-01-09 21:01:27] <!shuraba_> he thought we were going to become a socialist republic and voluntarily join the USSR KEKDOUBLEYOU
[2023-01-09 21:01:49] <%$78someone78> ah the great man lenin himself
[2023-01-09 21:01:51] <%$78someone78> what a good guy
[2023-01-09 21:02:01] <%suxexile> Hmm
[2023-01-09 21:02:21] <!shuraba_> there's a park where I live called "lenin's park"
[2023-01-09 21:02:33] <!shuraba_> because he was such a good dude Clueless
[2023-01-09 21:02:41] <%suxexile> didnt realize you can say russian but not the country itself in here PepeLaf
[2023-01-09 21:03:34] <%suxexile> i was saying now russians are at the point where theyre trying to force finland into cooperating with them
[2023-01-09 21:03:53] <!shuraba_> HUHH
[2023-01-09 21:04:38] <%suxexile> wasn't there some sort of news where those guys are threatening finland if the country joins nato or some shit
[2023-01-09 21:05:05] <!shuraba_> empty threats
[2023-01-09 21:05:47] <!shuraba_> it's not like they can actually stop us
[2023-01-09 21:05:54] <%suxexile> not like they can try violence over there anyway, or that's just instantly triggers EXPLOSION all over eu
[2023-01-09 21:06:59] <%suxexile> welp ig i'll just have to wait until june to see if I go for the 4060 or just take the 3070 instead Thinkge
[2023-01-09 21:07:19] <%trolsopol> what do you have now ?
[2023-01-09 21:07:41] <%suxexile> 1650
[2023-01-09 21:07:48] <%suxexile> but that isnt exactly from my money tho
[2023-01-09 21:07:58] <%suxexile> the intended upgrade will come from my wallet
[2023-01-09 21:08:04] <%trolsopol> i would say wait for 4060 but get 3070
[2023-01-09 21:08:05] <!shuraba_> nvidia Susge
[2023-01-09 21:08:10] <%trolsopol> it will be cheaper
[2023-01-09 21:08:15] <%trolsopol> or get amd YEPP
[2023-01-09 21:08:17] <!shuraba_> do you need cuda or is there another reason
[2023-01-09 21:09:09] <!shuraba_> from what I can tell right now that's the only reason to buy nvidia
[2023-01-09 21:09:19] <%suxexile> i wouldve just gone for amd if i wasnt required to use apps that only nvidia can do a decent job at
[2023-01-09 21:09:25] <%trolsopol> dlss 3 is pretty good yesyes
[2023-01-09 21:09:28] <!shuraba_> Despair
[2023-01-09 21:10:56] <%trolsopol> i'll probably go for 7900 xtx but waiting for my yearly bonus in the end of the month
[2023-01-09 21:11:58] <%suxexile> until the time comes where amd (hell even intel) makes a significant leap for that department for a consideration, that is if they dont start pricing like nvidia does
