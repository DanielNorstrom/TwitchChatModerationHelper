[2023-01-02 00:35:44] <%PneumaWHU> then you can cleave
[2023-01-02 00:35:44] <FENIXHAZE10> its better to kill him you will get fear dr
[2023-01-02 00:35:47] <%Aegis_2566> There will be more mobs coming over the fight
[2023-01-02 00:35:58] <+michaelmm> I stun the boss as it runs through the boss and then it just dies to cleave.
[2023-01-02 00:36:03] <Fanzer> @AnnieFuchsia you need to kill them, more will come. Then you have 2 adds going for the next ballista

[2023-01-02 15:07:08] <%Sne4ky79> lose rateing and 2nd more drastic rateing drop or 48-72 hour lockout
[2023-01-02 15:07:20] <%PanicRush> irl decapitation sounds more reasonable punishment
[2023-01-02 15:07:32] <%Geoffku> anyway we go agane with another group
[2023-01-02 15:10:12] <%Sne4ky79> i get ppl have irl things happen and have to leave in a hurry but after repeating doing same thing they should get punished for it.

[2023-01-02 17:42:17] <%Wardrick7> is it worth doing frontlines for series xp?
[2023-01-02 17:42:49] <%drzaius30> might as well do the daily at least
[2023-01-02 17:43:45] <%drzaius30> i would be surprised if it was quicker than crystalline though
[2023-01-02 17:43:55] <%Wardrick7> i was hoping its not worth LUL
[2023-01-02 17:43:59] <@%^Annies_Bot>* The sub-train has ended at 2!
[2023-01-02 17:44:07] <%Wardrick7> i guess time to mald a bit more
[2023-01-02 17:44:07] <%drzaius30> i doubt it
[2023-01-02 17:44:21] <%drzaius30> frontline games can be long
[2023-01-02 17:44:43] <%drzaius30> the fastest crystalline i had was like 45 secs
[2023-01-02 17:45:04] <%NoName6834> oof
[2023-01-02 17:45:09] <%drzaius30> been on both ends of it stomped or getting stomped LUL
[2023-01-02 17:45:49] <%Wardrick7> thats good, at least pain ends fast while frontlines torture you for a long time Pain
[2023-01-02 17:46:32] <%Wardrick7> at least in crystalline you feel that you can do something while in frontlines its just depressing when you get double teamed
[2023-01-02 17:47:06] <%drzaius30> yeah three factions is rough
[2023-01-02 17:47:40] <%drzaius30> really throws off win percentage 56 games for 10 wins
[2023-01-02 17:48:57] <%NoName6834> I need the garo mount from frontlines Despairge
[2023-01-02 17:49:19] <%NoName6834> dont tell me its that bad Despairge
[2023-01-02 17:49:41] <%drzaius30> @NoName6834 its a luck game

[2023-01-02 17:52:19] <%NoName6834> last time I remember doing frontlines was beginning of stormblood when the xp was good KEKW
[2023-01-02 17:53:21] <%drzaius30> my advice is just do the daily
[2023-01-02 17:53:47] <%drzaius30> don't torture yourself grinding it
[2023-01-02 17:55:15] <%NoName6834> did you?

[2023-01-02 18:02:11] <%Wardrick7> its so hard to get into 16
[2023-01-02 18:02:14] <%Taylor131313> that's how i roll xdd

[2023-01-02 18:06:54] <%Wardrick7> if i remember correctly she recently accidentaly used membership so went to npc again to buy another one

[2023-01-02 18:25:19] <%drzaius30> i believe series one rewards will no longer be claimable as of 6.3 so hopefully they get added to the crystal trophy vendor
[2023-01-02 18:26:07] <%drzaius30> if that happens then the mount and minions from series 2 should also show up there come 6.4
[2023-01-02 18:27:36] <%Wardrick7> so i just did a 25m frontline for 1.3k series xp and 2min crystalline for 900xp, frontline is not efficient xdd

[2023-01-02 19:50:48] <%drzaius30> LINES WAYTOODANK
[2023-01-02 19:58:38] <%JurgenRapp> UK and US guys. In UK does terrific only mean really good? But in the US it can mean both really good or really bad?
[2023-01-02 19:59:41] <%Collnaris> terrific? you can use it sarcastically
[2023-01-02 20:00:07] <%JurgenRapp> "Be careful however with the adjective terrific which does not have the same meaning as horrific. Whereas horrific means very bad, terrific means very good."
[2023-01-02 20:00:19] <%JurgenRapp> thats from a uk site
[2023-01-02 20:01:06] <%JurgenRapp> but from a US site it says that it also can mean "causing great fear or dismay; terrifying; dreadful; appalling"
[2023-01-02 20:01:43] <%JurgenRapp> so I was thinking if it's a us vs uk thing where it not used in the same way
[2023-01-02 20:02:31] <%PneumaWHU> never heard terrific = terror in UK
[2023-01-02 20:03:28] <%JurgenRapp> ok thanks
[2023-01-02 20:04:11] <%Collnaris> I’ve never heard anyone use it in relation to terror
