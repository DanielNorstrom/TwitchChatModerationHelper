[2022-12-14 04:46:20] <@%siia> hey now you got a shit tattoo to add to the comp next time
[2022-12-14 04:46:21] <@%siia> XD
[2022-12-14 04:46:29] <+FoxySama94> I personally am an advocate of hand an wrist tats
[2022-12-14 04:46:29] <RunningIdeaMachine> I would want hand tattoos
[2022-12-14 04:46:36] <UsernamesAreOp> @Timakaze Yeah everyone knows those warnings only apply inside the state of California
[2022-12-14 04:46:36] <blisssttv> Goodnight gamma I need sleep cause I have a tatto appointment at 7 AM tomorrow üò≠
[2022-12-14 04:46:41] <%BeelRuna> I was actually thinking maybe the calf, so if I wear shorts anyone would be able to see it
[2022-12-14 04:46:50] <+FoxySama94> Only downside is that hand tattoos do fade quickly
[2022-12-14 04:47:00] <@%siia> honest get one small tattoo just to get over the bump of expectations

[2022-12-14 10:17:08] <%$JuviusBBHscar> Guns are usually used by Hunter's that regulate the wild life , anyone else is a no no for me
[2022-12-14 10:17:09] <hz_ainz> the safest gun is one that doesnt exist

[2022-12-14 10:17:44] <%Astropigey> making guns harder to get only makes the issues of crime worse, guns should require more training

[2022-12-14 10:19:24] <%+AzzaNine> we don't deal with crackheads in Aus
[2022-12-14 10:19:29] <Tasrayryn> I'm not pro grun, but you can get a gun in Australia if you have a legitimate purpose for it, such as being a farmer for controlling wildlife, being a competitive shooter, if you're a hunter, etc.
[2022-12-14 10:19:39] <fm_productions> one argument is that if everyone has a gun it's easier to keep rogue people in check. But judging by number of gun violence deaths, it certainly isn't better in the US. Another argument would be that you have something to defend yourself when the government goes rogue towards the citizens
[2022-12-14 10:19:46] <daha8901> even a bubble gun is not completely safe, granted you have to REALLY try to hurt yourself with one, but still
[2022-12-14 10:19:46] <%Astropigey> You can't just make guns dissappear nowadays its the greatest equalizer, just look at Japan who has the greatest gun control laws in the world and the PM got bliccied by a home made shotgun
