[2022-12-19 22:19:49] <+dorothyxxo> fear of unfulfilled dreams has honestly been making my game unplayable recently
[2022-12-19 22:19:52] <%+cinnabutter> Have you turned it off and turned it back on?
[2022-12-19 22:19:52] <%+maiziemaze23> It's been happening to me too. I switch between Live and Edit modes to try and curb it. But if it's laggy it tends to stay that way until I pick the game back up in a month.

[2022-12-19 22:35:07] <%+nachosims334> the funny part about it is that my mother and her husband never use the second sink. they just use the one closest to the door
[2022-12-19 22:35:08] <alienatedwebster> that's precious

[2022-12-19 22:48:23] <Ari_0401> Great tip!
[2022-12-19 22:48:26] <%+stephspotato> they should give an options on posters for if we want them framed or not
[2022-12-19 22:48:30] <+garnetrising> Though the split frame was kinda a cool effect.
[2022-12-19 22:48:32] <digibatz> wish they‚Äôd include frames separate from artwork in the game üò≠

[2022-12-19 22:54:17] <%+fuzzy__pumpkin> Something we need in Sims5...frames for paintings that work like the photo ones.
[2022-12-19 22:54:17] <%+crazycatlady_22> could you make your own custom frame with shelving?
[2022-12-19 22:54:17] <+melicality> Debug mini wood planks or something like that?
[2022-12-19 22:54:18] <juliebeans2> i personally dont like forced placement like that for gameplay
[2022-12-19 22:54:18] <%+madisonemily8> as taylor swift said, "Sometimes giving up is the strong thing"
[2022-12-19 22:54:18] <hellaanxiousx100> TakeNRG
[2022-12-19 22:54:18] <%faeriebird> Can you paint that image from reference?
[2022-12-19 22:54:18] <%kaytast> make a sim paint from the reference
[2022-12-19 22:54:19] <mrsd1901> why dont you do a custom artfwork with the grapefruit
[2022-12-19 22:54:20] <%$Plourde4> Maybe the moschino pack. Don't they have frames?
[2022-12-19 22:54:21] <ShammaAlkuwari> tbh an amazing idea but the sims aint having it
[2022-12-19 22:54:22] <%$lisaaa_1114> what about paintings from the gallery
[2022-12-19 22:54:25] <%+itkimmyyyyy> Another trick I sometimes see is taking the Vlad painting, and using it a bunch just to frame any size poster
[2022-12-19 22:54:27] <+seakangaroo22> This picture is too much trouble just use a different one
[2022-12-19 22:54:28] <%alicexaw> is there anything in debug that you can use to individually place?
[2022-12-19 22:54:31] <%$EhhAndi> where is this frame from?
[2022-12-19 22:54:34] <RoseMildred> Photo frame?
[2022-12-19 22:54:34] <ulciag> can you get a sim to paint it and then hang the painting?
[2022-12-19 22:54:36] <%+dcknx> would making a custom frame from a shelf work?

[2022-12-19 23:33:50] <allie0717> Smart!
[2022-12-19 23:33:52] <annabeth_s2024> Girl chill out
[2022-12-19 23:33:53] <@%$Little_Dica> @justRayxox !ignored you're not being ignored, it's just that a lot of messages pass by!
[2022-12-19 23:33:53] <@%^Moobot> @justRayxox Kayla is doing her best to play the game and keep up with chat, but sometimes messages gets missed. Just because she didn't read it out loud or missed a message in chat does not mean you're being ignored, we promise! simsieLove
[2022-12-19 23:33:53] <%+ohitsbrooklyn> a rug that actually layers? omg
[2022-12-19 23:33:54] <%+cinnamonroll372> I like it!!
[2022-12-19 23:33:56] <%+GrandmaEugene> Looks great
[2022-12-19 23:33:56] <%+darth_jesweak> cute
[2022-12-19 23:33:58] <chirz567> Yea love it
[2022-12-19 23:33:59] <%modernwednesday> I have learned that kayla probably has read it, but she can't acknowledge every message all the time or she won't be able to play the game
[2022-12-19 23:34:02] <coolkidrae16> dif color?
[2022-12-19 23:34:06] <auroraama> it's look too much
[2022-12-19 23:34:06] <denahasnoidea> the rug is super nice but the bed is honestly not the vibes
[2022-12-19 23:34:06] <%ziggylagoon> darker color would make it look more 'mature' i guess
[2022-12-19 23:34:06] <%sulsulsunflower> I didn't realize I love those rugs until I started layering them
[2022-12-19 23:34:06] <%+smooth_tortoise> What? You can‚Äôt build without looking at the game? And you call yourself a summer? /s
[2022-12-19 23:34:07] <%+fernbabie> keep it keep it, just change the bookshelf?
[2022-12-19 23:34:07] <%Dawnie3296> It is fine.
[2022-12-19 23:34:08] <vicky_idfc> I like it!
[2022-12-19 23:34:11] <%+goldencubba> move it back one
[2022-12-19 23:34:11] <callmereeses> i dont really like the red with the pink tbh
[2022-12-19 23:34:12] <%+eeaabbhhaa> is there another colour for the shelf
[2022-12-19 23:34:12] <RedLikeRozes> Maybe with a diff bed?
[2022-12-19 23:34:14] <its_nala_> it‚Äôs a bit redish
[2022-12-19 23:34:15] <+hughby07> Hi
[2022-12-19 23:34:16] <chelseakrave> yeah the curved shelf looks too child like
[2022-12-19 23:34:19] VIEWERS: 3¬†644
[2022-12-19 23:34:19] <%sulsulsunflower> they are such an off shape and size
[2022-12-19 23:34:22] <%ShammahBrownie> its far from the pink/orange vibes
[2022-12-19 23:34:25] <idk12335678> it's my birthdayyy
[2022-12-19 23:34:25] <%+jo_silver90> the shelf feels teen to me, not primary bedroom
[2022-12-19 23:34:26] <+oxhornz> every time i watch a lilsimsie stream i see a rug swatch ive never seen before
[2022-12-19 23:34:26] <auroraama> it's not for that bed, maybe something more simple?
[2022-12-19 23:34:27] <savylee13> You may have settled on the bed, but there are a lot of purples in it. Maybe that‚Äôs throwing it off?
[2022-12-19 23:34:27] <girlnamedfish> LesbianPride
[2022-12-19 23:34:29] <%mallowsauce> It would be impossible for Kayla to read every single chat out loud AND play sims
[2022-12-19 23:34:33] <%fl1ntandsteel_> i think the patterned bed is what makes it teen-like, but its still cute!
[2022-12-19 23:34:33] <%sarizaurd> but also not everything deserves a response? and you're valid for that lmao
[2022-12-19 23:34:33] <%justRayxox> It‚Äôs ok. I understand
[2022-12-19 23:34:35] <Stooby09> I would sub but im broke lol
[2022-12-19 23:34:36] <%$lisa71670> The bed and bookshelf seem more teen than adult to me  lol
[2022-12-19 23:34:36] <ninetiescool> simsieEyes
[2022-12-19 23:34:37] <%afrench1520> its impossible to read everything
[2022-12-19 23:34:37] <@%+ceesees> be nice to simsie!

[2022-12-19 23:34:41] <%+julspy> I'm not playing a game while watching and I can't keep up with chat, lol
[2022-12-19 23:34:42] <%$kaylabedayla> Different color of the shelf?
[2022-12-19 23:34:43] <burialbubbles> His
[2022-12-19 23:34:46] <%+wetbagsmell> is this apartment for anything? or just building to build?
[2022-12-19 23:34:47] <%+rschwartz0107> I agree with you
[2022-12-19 23:34:48] <WolfyFiesta> it's really hard to read chat and build and think at the same time!! lol
[2022-12-19 23:34:48] <kerchow420> is this a teen room
[2022-12-19 23:34:51] <%heatherlouise_> Is snappy sleeping with her head in the cushion simsieOMG simsieOMG

[2022-12-19 23:34:52] <chirz567> You‚Äôre are amazing x
[2022-12-19 23:34:52] <%+kaydotdog> my favorite thing about kayla is that she is doing her best
[2022-12-19 23:34:53] <%modernwednesday> as an adult myself, I would have those things
[2022-12-19 23:34:53] <%lindsayx0> do you still do fixer uppers/fixmelilsimsie houses???
[2022-12-19 23:34:55] <%Rokawii> aaah her face is squished against the seat so cuuute simsieHearts
[2022-12-19 23:34:56] <%$sammythesparkleberry> Maybe swap the rooms fully?
[2022-12-19 23:34:57] <WMoore082020> I really enjoy that rug
[2022-12-19 23:34:57] <nerd1alert1> swap decors of the bedrooms? lol
[2022-12-19 23:34:59] <ipoip_> make the rug a bit smaller no ?
[2022-12-19 23:34:59] <micameg> appreciate you kayla simsieCrab

[2022-12-19 23:35:01] <%+sim_savannah> dont worry! you don't need to read/respond to chat at all times lol
[2022-12-19 23:35:01] <+ace_O_space> Can anyone tell me what pack the bed is from? It‚Äôs very cute :3
[2022-12-19 23:35:01] <%afrench1520> ooh i have exactly 300K eggs
[2022-12-19 23:35:02] <+emtokyo> it doesn't have to be the primary bedroom right?
[2022-12-19 23:35:03] <marie_something> Can still be a fun adult tho
[2022-12-19 23:35:03] <%mallowsauce> All good vibes here
[2022-12-19 23:35:04] <Nami_Lindette> why not switch the furnitures ?
[2022-12-19 23:35:05] <burialbubbles> Hi all!
[2022-12-19 23:35:05] <leojazzy> this whole apartment is so cool

[2022-12-19 23:35:07] <indslosa> change the color of the bookshelf, has a really nice swaches though :)
[2022-12-19 23:35:08] <karinamontmelo> Maybe switch the besd over?
[2022-12-19 23:35:09] <%+cinnamonroll372> What if you switched the furniture in the two bedrooms?
[2022-12-19 23:35:09] <Stooby09> Snap is camera shy awh :3
[2022-12-19 23:35:10] <%$jenniferlundqvist> well, I'm an adult and I would totally have that bed

[2022-12-19 23:35:14] <%fl1ntandsteel_> you can switch the stuff trom the other room if you want!
[2022-12-19 23:35:16] <+eightwait> seems more mature
[2022-12-19 23:35:16] <dracustien> yeah that bed fits a bit more
[2022-12-19 23:35:21] <%+willisx2dan> Who says it can't be a  cute and fun primary bedroom?
[2022-12-19 23:35:21] <L0hna> the teen spends so much time in the bathroom doing makeup so they need the onsuite
[2022-12-19 23:35:22] <%+clairesims4> yess
[2022-12-19 23:35:23] <kerchow420> i like the bed on the ceiling
[2022-12-19 23:35:28] <%soymilkcocoa> why does the bed want to float  lmao
[2022-12-19 23:35:33] <%+cinnamonroll372> What pack is that bed from?
[2022-12-19 23:35:33] <@%^Moobot> simsieNo NO, DO THIS! CHANGE THIS! EWWWW! Backseat gaming is NEVER allowed. Suggestions are always appreciated, but do not attempt to make demands or force Kayla to do anything. There is a difference between friendly suggestions and aggressive demands. Ultimately she is the one playing the game, not you! simsieNo
[2022-12-19 23:35:37] <%+TheGurker> @ace_o_space High school years! :)
[2022-12-19 23:35:37] <starsonggamez> yes put the bed on the ceiling
[2022-12-19 23:35:37] <+barlee89> The parents wanted to give their teen the better room
[2022-12-19 23:35:37] <%ziggylagoon> poll for bed on the ceiling

[2022-12-19 23:35:44] <marie_something> As much as i liked the other bed i do agree with you
[2022-12-19 23:35:44] <MiaMys306> how about a sitting area in the window corner?
[2022-12-19 23:35:45] <%sulsulsunflower> I'll look away while you swap the furniture in those bedrooms lol
[2022-12-19 23:35:46] <+ace_O_space> @thegurker thank you!
[2022-12-19 23:35:50] <%+casey28_> could you put the other bed in the other room?

[2022-12-19 23:36:34] <+absolutely_jtruly> the kitty face planted in the sofa is literally me

[2022-12-19 23:39:18] <IdioticFrog> i don't love the bed either
[2022-12-19 23:39:18] <%+callistosims_xo> Bed is okay but it doesn't match as much
[2022-12-19 23:39:18] <%Dawnie3296> What about some of the landscape space prints?
[2022-12-19 23:39:19] <bungbobby> cat tree
[2022-12-19 23:39:20] <%justRayxox> Its the bed, not you
[2022-12-19 23:39:21] <auroraama> you could use the cute plan as idea for the colours
[2022-12-19 23:39:26] <%+callistosims_xo> The HS years bed was better imo
[2022-12-19 23:39:27] <squiblebaby> i love how you causally build the coolest things
[2022-12-19 23:39:27] <+elle_loup> Cat tree

[2022-12-19 23:39:33] <%ShammahBrownie> @ShammahBrownie ohhhhh yess i can see that
[2022-12-19 23:39:34] <+simssydney> Maybe do a neutral bed and pink everything else?
[2022-12-19 23:39:35] <sniperchic256> I like it
[2022-12-19 23:39:40] <%Rokawii> i dont know if it is true but i read somewhere that if you always yawn when you see someone yaws that means you are highly empathetic
[2022-12-19 23:39:41] <%ziggylagoon> can it just be a teen room
[2022-12-19 23:39:45] <%heatherlouise_> Maybe it‚Äôs the modern windows
[2022-12-19 23:39:45] <%42hitch42> the bed is a very warm pink, it's not vibing with the cooler pinks in the room
[2022-12-19 23:39:47] <%+emsyjd> i like the rug with a neutral looking bed
[2022-12-19 23:39:48] <%justRayxox> Love the rug

[2022-12-19 23:39:53] <%Dawnie3296> My favourite rug too. I use it a lot.
[2022-12-19 23:39:54] <%ShammahBrownie> Strangervile has cute pink/orange posters tbh
[2022-12-19 23:39:55] <%+amapola6684> the rug is really nice, but the borders are weird
[2022-12-19 23:39:55] <%+callistosims_xo> I think rug is okay but the pink is too dark in it
[2022-12-19 23:39:56] <%kaytast> it kind of looks like a huge towel hahahha
[2022-12-19 23:39:56] <%$SailorScout04> I like that rug too!

[2022-12-19 23:39:58] <%modernwednesday> it's very 2000s
[2022-12-19 23:40:00] <%+ohitsbrooklyn> i think the shades of the rug and bed didn't vibe
[2022-12-19 23:40:00] <not_jenna23> What about that white bed from high school with the white flower pattern?
[2022-12-19 23:40:00] <%$sammythesparkleberry> I think the rug was maybe too bright for the bed
[2022-12-19 23:40:00] <indslosa> feels more adult that bed
[2022-12-19 23:40:00] <%$nuclearself> the blue and yellow swathes of that rug are stunning

[2022-12-19 23:51:04] <denahasnoidea> it looks really nice if you put that curtain in the curtain, you should try it!
[2022-12-19 23:51:04] <queenpasta> i really hope the new expansion packs coming have some small cute apartments
[2022-12-19 23:51:04] <@%$Little_Dica> some of the ones in this very block could be sliced into 2 apartments

[2022-12-19 23:51:27] <%+SpaceVolcanoes> eco living has some of the best apartments in the whole game
[2022-12-19 23:51:29] <%+charlotte_libby> i do love the eco lifestyle apartments
[2022-12-19 23:51:31] <%kaytast> i wished i lived in a huge apartment but i want my sims to suffer
[2022-12-19 23:51:34] <%$mushfroggie> i made an appt in the arts district and i didn't know what to do with the walls...sooo high..i settled on platforms, so much split leveling
[2022-12-19 23:51:36] <Haydenb437> what‚Äôs your favorite large apartment?
[2022-12-19 23:51:46] <%+bunnexofficial> penny always just walks into my apartment and my sims dont even know her simsieCry
[2022-12-19 23:51:46] <@%$Little_Dica> this is tall wall height right?
[2022-12-19 23:51:46] <%+ThomalinX> simsie stream makes a bad day so much better simsieLove
[2022-12-19 23:51:46] <KingBasieSims4> There's a build where someone turned it into 4 apartments
[2022-12-19 23:51:47] <casey_sims13> that‚Äôs the appartment I did earlier on your street
[2022-12-19 23:51:48] <presleyrenem> What do you want for Christmas?
[2022-12-19 23:51:53] <%soymilkcocoa> true its kinda awkward
[2022-12-19 23:51:55] <francistemporarily> Idk if y‚Äôall are having this glitch but when I try to place an apartment it says ‚Äúcannot place due to fixed item‚Äù no matter what I do  T-T
[2022-12-19 23:51:59] <bimbofemme> its actually a really good apartment if you use a platform to make a bedroom next to that high window
[2022-12-19 23:52:00] <%ShammahBrownie> same!!
[2022-12-19 23:52:08] <minitornado_8> I love apartments but the neighbors are literally the most annoying thing ever like ill be trying to sleep at 11 pm and then the neighbors just HAVE to have a party
[2022-12-19 23:52:08] <%+kalespresso> love that one too :)
[2022-12-19 23:52:09] <%plantsy> i have such high ceilings in my apartment
[2022-12-19 23:52:09] <koromindo> Ohh now I see which one you are doing! Thanks. But yes I 1000% agree with you, they made the apartments here have a larger floor plan than any house I have ever lived in haha
[2022-12-19 23:52:10] <%$sammythesparkleberry> he tall walls are actually pretty common on older NYC apartment buildings. idk why though. But it is realistic.
[2022-12-19 23:52:11] <%modernwednesday> I've never used that one before
[2022-12-19 23:52:17] <corakken> checking in as someone who just moved out of a moldy, 350sq foot apartment with giant walls. it just meant there was more space for more mold üòÉ

[2022-12-19 23:52:21] <%$nuclearself> the spice district ones with the short walls are the best
[2022-12-19 23:52:23] <samxconley> Do the eco living apartments still work even if you don‚Äôt have city living?
[2022-12-19 23:52:24] <%afrench1520> i like the hakim house apartments so much, i love the huge windows

[2022-12-19 23:52:47] <%+emsyjd> i wish we had between small and medium
[2022-12-19 23:52:50] <queenpasta> i understand but i don't get why we can't change the wall height in apartments, like it's the sims cmon
[2022-12-19 23:52:52] <blurryvhs> death penalty
[2022-12-19 23:52:55] <%belladota> I like making a bunch of tinystudios within one of the apartments
[2022-12-19 23:52:57] <%$sammythesparkleberry> fair. tall walls suck in the sims.
[2022-12-19 23:52:58] <+ace_O_space> I only use tall walls for towers
[2022-12-19 23:52:59] <%samanthalovescats> my apartment irl has really tall walls and i hate it
[2022-12-19 23:53:02] <%kaytast> some things are good IRL but not good in the sims
[2022-12-19 23:53:03] <%afrench1520> its hard to fill the walls
[2022-12-19 23:53:03] <denahasnoidea> lots of high ceiligs in europe, beautiful but not ideal for heating
[2022-12-19 23:53:04] <%+amapola6684> i only used tall walls for a tiny loft i did
[2022-12-19 23:53:05] <%Dawnie3296> Aww she stretched.

[2022-12-19 23:53:13] <casey_sims13> The tall walls make the apartments so big and I don‚Äôt like it
[2022-12-19 23:53:14] <%samanthalovescats> oh that is so smart
