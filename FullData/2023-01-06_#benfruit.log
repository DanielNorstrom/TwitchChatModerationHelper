[2023-01-06 07:44:59] <%chikgotya> Hey Benji 👋 How's the leg breaking going bud?
[2023-01-06 07:45:05] <%DustinsBlazin420> loveeee youuu toooo
[2023-01-06 07:45:34] <+soxes_> it's fun, but you have to be in the mood for intenz, much slower playstyle
[2023-01-06 07:45:51] <%$johnblitzd> Imagine if you could do a poo and wee in dayz lol @benfruit
[2023-01-06 07:46:02] <%chikgotya> get some bear traps set up n just watch em drop LUL we won't tell jackie 👌
[2023-01-06 07:46:06] <@%teedeepee> @genainamoraes Not at all, but if you write in Portuguese, your messages will be removed because we cannot moderate what we don't understand
[2023-01-06 07:46:16] <justin_5099> this syberia mode sounds cool I'd like to try it out
[2023-01-06 07:46:31] <+thepanhandler> You level up your skills like running for longer or better at harvesting food and meat
[2023-01-06 07:46:40] <%DustinsBlazin420> @johnblitzd  i was just talkin to my homies about that lmao

[2023-01-06 07:46:52] <%$johnblitzd> Lol @dustinsblazin420
[2023-01-06 07:47:05] <justin_5099> saw a server earlier that you can smoke weed n get seeds to grow it lol
[2023-01-06 07:47:09] <+xXReckXx> Ben can’t catch fish so he’ll die pretty fast lol
[2023-01-06 07:47:10] <+thepanhandler> You have to do them to get better at them
[2023-01-06 07:47:10] <%DustinsBlazin420> can we shit on the players too 😂😂
[2023-01-06 07:47:14] <+soxes_> u get 30 points to start then you have to do activities for the rest
[2023-01-06 07:47:20] <%DustinsBlazin420> and piss on em
[2023-01-06 07:47:21] <+hurjio_> i would definitely recommend you check it out at some point Ben!
[2023-01-06 07:47:50] <+thepanhandler> Resets when you die so if you die often
[2023-01-06 07:47:56] <%DustinsBlazin420> okay i have to sleep 😂 its 2am 😂
[2023-01-06 07:48:05] <%DustinsBlazin420> have to be up at 6
[2023-01-06 07:48:06] <ItsDayZed> Intenz has a ballistic ping unfortunately.
[2023-01-06 07:48:20] <+soxes_> it's pretty rad, but like I said before you gotta be in the mood for a slower playstyle. people are alot more timid so they don't lose skills
[2023-01-06 07:48:45] VIEWERS: 329
[2023-01-06 07:49:06] <+xXReckXx> Ben would cause so much chaos in the server
[2023-01-06 07:49:06] <$the_fendercaster> plus a dream
[2023-01-06 07:49:15] <justin_5099> yeah I can see people being way more cautious bc so much to lose when you die
[2023-01-06 07:49:33] <cl1ckxd> a friend, a gun, a vest a helmet
[2023-01-06 07:49:36] <+izikielrage> Those are the ingredients for domination. @BenFruit

[2023-01-06 11:59:07] <%D4ddyMac> @zdottyog will keep fingers crossed 4 u.
[2023-01-06 11:59:19] <%abelson9000> you take a plastic bag and you put it in the case, then inject the foam into the bag
[2023-01-06 11:59:26] <!%TheSausageContinuim> but harder
[2023-01-06 11:59:36] <ZdottyOG> if the shipping company packages it, its covered by insurance. but if you pack it yourself it breaks they wont pay shit. So im going to havee them do it so if ot breaks they will pay for it.
[2023-01-06 11:59:43] <zFOXX1> Just send the least important parts, keep the important ones and bring with you like graphics card etc
[2023-01-06 12:00:02] <%D4ddyMac> id strap it to my back and walk just to be safe
