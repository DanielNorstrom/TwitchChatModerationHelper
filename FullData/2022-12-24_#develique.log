[2022-12-24 12:11:34] <Nickraschilla> Google never works when you really need the answers, use the bubbles
[2022-12-24 12:11:38] <%+FkSorcerer> ask mama dev haha
[2022-12-24 12:11:40] <%wardles10> DON'T USE THE SPARKLING
[2022-12-24 12:11:45] <%CrankyCom> or white vinegar
[2022-12-24 12:11:52] <+NightStreamer21> that white bubbly should work but take bubbles out of it
[2022-12-24 12:11:52] <%+wickedsteel78> fax @prawnofthedead and I'm genuinely surprised

[2022-12-24 12:12:04] <!%Itz_Progamer> I would not recommend using the sparkling
[2022-12-24 12:12:12] <%TheKappaIsSilent> Use the sparkling for drinking lirikSMART

[2022-12-24 12:12:20] <%CrankyCom> yeah dont use sparkling
[2022-12-24 12:12:21] <%moisesbed> Uber eats the cannoli
[2022-12-24 12:12:23] <%xSchlonkyyy> Might be too late tho
[2022-12-24 12:12:23] <%Angry_bull1t> SPARKLING NOT ADVISED
[2022-12-24 12:12:34] <%Stezey_> dry white wine means you can basically use any white wine
[2022-12-24 12:12:38] VIEWERS: 300
[2022-12-24 12:12:40] <Nickraschilla> Yeah tbh I’ve never heard of that wine and I work in a bar
[2022-12-24 12:12:41] <%Dave_Brockie> maybe see if Britt or Fasfy have any?
[2022-12-24 12:12:42] <themoondoggg> sounds about right lol
[2022-12-24 12:12:45] <%Stezey_> chardonnay or sauv blanc might be best though

[2022-12-24 12:14:13] <%Stezey_> sparkling wine is probably better than no wine
[2022-12-24 12:14:14] <%wardles10> Drink the sparkling instead
[2022-12-24 12:14:15] <+NightStreamer21> white wine with bubbles - pour in glass, stir until flat, taste for proof, leave on bench until room temp
[2022-12-24 12:14:20] <%moisesbed> Don’t have any wine at all ?

[2022-12-24 12:27:24] <%drpickleshroom> that will ruin it

[2022-12-24 12:27:37] <@%prawnofthedead> The same way you make a carbonated rink flat
[2022-12-24 12:27:37] <%seethingaardvark> The sparkling wine is a much better idea
[2022-12-24 12:27:38] <%xSchlonkyyy> Because THEY ARENT THE SAME
[2022-12-24 12:27:42] <+NightStreamer21> stir it,  shake it

[2022-12-24 12:28:06] <%xSchlonkyyy> Yes
[2022-12-24 12:28:06] <%drpickleshroom> balsamic is very overpowering normal vinegar isnt
[2022-12-24 12:28:06] <ImJoelay> brandy or cognac would work if you got that
[2022-12-24 12:28:09] <%+ItsxLivvv> Is this for the dough or the filling?
[2022-12-24 12:28:10] <bobzilla_swe> yes
[2022-12-24 12:28:12] <%moisesbed> Sit on the wine that will surely flatten it
[2022-12-24 12:28:15] <%xSchlonkyyy> Way better choice the BALSAMIC VINEGAR
[2022-12-24 12:28:17] <%seethingaardvark> Better that than balsamic vinegar
[2022-12-24 12:28:17] <%yesitsactuallyme> throw some powder in it
[2022-12-24 12:28:17] <%wardles10> do you not have any other wine>
[2022-12-24 12:28:19] <@%prawnofthedead> Get all the bubbles out of it, taste to make sure it tastes "Not bubbly" or anything
