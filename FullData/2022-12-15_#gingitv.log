[2022-12-15 17:18:01] <anthr4zit> That’s the most boring rwf ever. Thursday evening and not a foot has been stepped into mythic
[2022-12-15 17:18:10] <trulton> Mythic NOW or i leave to Liquid stream
[2022-12-15 17:18:13] <%Bravehunter> did we saw it they got loot distrubuted yet?
[2022-12-15 17:18:17] <+QtDivinity> @Dundersak they have a decent amount of heroic razs to do
[2022-12-15 17:18:19] <Glacius_7> @Bravehunter Yes
[2022-12-15 17:18:21] <Arkshol> last race was like this

[2022-12-15 17:18:28] <Dundersak> @anthr4zit Thats not true 3 guild have entered mythic
[2022-12-15 17:18:31] <+lhatefizz> @trulton Who asked
[2022-12-15 17:18:46] <maxxximuzz> @anthr4zit thats how it usually is when theres a new expansion nowdays, when its a new tier its different though
[2022-12-15 17:18:57] <EPOKCSGO> !best
[2022-12-15 17:19:04] <+sawyer_shepard> @trulton you baiting?
[2022-12-15 17:19:09] <+Jiblexic> @anthr4zit I think you're forgetting, heroic usually drops a week before mythic.
[2022-12-15 17:19:30] <+QtDivinity> Man I forgot how cringe rwf chats are regardless of which team they're rooting for they just rage if they arent spending 100hours on a boss
[2022-12-15 17:19:42] <mikkeal0> @Jiblexic same time this time
[2022-12-15 17:19:46] <Glacius_7> @QtDivinity Always has been
[2022-12-15 17:19:56] <+Jiblexic> @mikkeal0 Yea, which is why I said usually.
[2022-12-15 17:19:57] <@Echo_Esports> Why leave performance up to chance? Forge your own destiny with Horizon II Elite from StarForge Systems at echogg.ly/starforge/Gingi
[2022-12-15 17:20:18] <Arkshol> @qtdivinity agree, and also asking the same shit over and over, literally nuclear waste chat KEKW
[2022-12-15 17:20:29] <+QtDivinity> @Glacius_7 ya I forgot when watching rwf I have to go fullscreen in any channel because chats either flaming a decision or asking blatantly obvious questions that are answered on the screen repeatedly
[2022-12-15 17:20:30] <YaeroxTV> is he still using shadowed unit frames?
[2022-12-15 17:20:34] <Eskalekiew> @QtDivinity yeah sadly watched max stream last night exactly the same rwf chat is questionable
[2022-12-15 17:20:34] <trulton> Im back, Liquid has masks on LOL! No thanks
[2022-12-15 17:20:54] <Aylena_Evouline> twitch should require an iq test to be allowed to post in the chat.
[2022-12-15 17:20:55] <themaliciousrabbit> @QtDivinity People were deadass asking if guild were already on the last boss of mythic when guild were killing normal raz
[2022-12-15 17:20:58] <Arkshol> @trulton KEKW
[2022-12-15 17:21:01] <themaliciousrabbit> just no hope for some
[2022-12-15 17:21:06] <maxxximuzz> @trulton good to have yah back
[2022-12-15 17:21:06] <+QtDivinity> @trulton They have two sick players do you think they want to risk getting an entire team sick during the race?
[2022-12-15 17:21:16] <rektyynoob> @themaliciousrabbit hahahahaha
[2022-12-15 17:21:27] <+Jiblexic> Mythic chat
[2022-12-15 17:21:28] <TannerM> imagine being tilted that someone you are watching online has a mask on ...
[2022-12-15 17:21:39] <+QtDivinity> @TannerM Literally lmfao
[2022-12-15 17:21:50] <+QtDivinity> @themaliciousrabbit yep it's pretty insane lmao
[2022-12-15 17:21:50] <sitmetoo> you cant read there lips if they have on masks
[2022-12-15 17:22:04] <+sawyer_shepard> Which streamer has mask on?

[2022-12-15 17:22:08] <droPezZz> why are they always doing +17 ?
[2022-12-15 17:22:13] <Arkshol> that dude gotta be some anti vax cringe andy
[2022-12-15 17:22:43] <+QtDivinity> @sawyer_shepard liquid players had masks on due to two players being sick so they dont want to risk anyone getting sick during race
[2022-12-15 17:22:45] <+Jiblexic> @droPezZz So they can get rank 1.
[2022-12-15 17:23:02] <ksuper2> @droPezZz If they do they probably figured its the optimal lvl for ilvl/difiiculty of the key
[2022-12-15 17:23:10] <themaliciousrabbit> They dont care about getting rank 1 rn LUL
[2022-12-15 17:23:10] <%Tikerr> @droPezZz 17 drop 402 ilvl and item to upgrade to 418 ilvl
[2022-12-15 17:23:15] <+Dominyum> LOL
[2022-12-15 17:23:19] <Arkshol> @qtdivinity yup even though is a regular flu or something
[2022-12-15 17:23:20] <droPezZz> ty guys
[2022-12-15 17:23:47] <+QtDivinity> @Arkshol wearing a mask helps prevent spreading a regular flu aswell lmao
[2022-12-15 17:23:51] <steesuk91> hey @GingiTV do you buy 402 raid boes this time ?
[2022-12-15 17:23:55] <themaliciousrabbit> 17 is the cutoff for 402ilvl drops, same for 18, doesn't go to 405 until 19.
[2022-12-15 17:24:12] <+QtDivinity> getting any sickness during a RWF which could potentially get alot of players sick could literally lose them the race by itself

[2022-12-15 19:20:48] <+Ryauu> they are farming gear in high keys so they have an edge in mythic raid, its not that hard to understand
[2022-12-15 19:21:14] <Mattilainen> they're gearing as much as possible before progging mythic like every single other RWF the last couple years. nothing new or unseen
[2022-12-15 19:21:18] <kwlski01> LOS doesnt work anymore I think monkaHmm
[2022-12-15 19:21:20] <copponex> @Ryauu Is th eraid out?

[2022-12-15 19:22:29] <%JerrysBoBerrys> @rektyynoob I mean this raid was the best yet and made eu way earlier
[2022-12-15 19:22:35] <kaspookyy> the people perma not understanding why they're not in mythic raid yyet
[2022-12-15 19:22:59] <copponex> @kaspookyy Well if it
[2022-12-15 19:23:12] <%+Thoreya> youd think after the 6th race people would understand more lol
[2022-12-15 19:23:15] <copponex> it's been out since wednesday, then it makes sense to ask why they arent raiding
[2022-12-15 19:23:16] <GordiSexi> that song
[2022-12-15 19:23:25] <%JerrysBoBerrys> @copponex What?

[2022-12-15 19:23:35] <%JerrysBoBerrys> They gotta do splits

[2022-12-15 19:24:19] <copponex> @JerrysBoBerrys I just asked, and people said the raid has been out since wednesday. Isn't it normal to try to prog while the raid is out? And only go for gear if you're hardstuck?
[2022-12-15 19:24:20] <%bzk1_> just watch echo channel
[2022-12-15 19:24:20] <kaspookyy> and asking why they're doing a MOP dungeon when the keystone wa/auddon is on the right
[2022-12-15 19:24:40] <%+Thoreya> @pa_d_96 its bad lol
[2022-12-15 19:24:44] <BadNewsCommin> @kaspookyy somebody told the guy for transmog ICANT
[2022-12-15 19:24:46] <themaliciousrabbit> they're farming old content for transmog
[2022-12-15 19:24:46] <%maserow> @copponex Typically yes, when theres a week gap between hc and Mythic
[2022-12-15 19:24:49] <fernando_461> i think they gonna farm till 8 and go mythic then

[2022-12-15 19:25:10] <%+Thoreya> they still have to do normal splits
[2022-12-15 19:25:13] <ThalashEEE> @copponex there's more to it than just gear, first guild to go mythic shows comp and strats
[2022-12-15 19:25:17] <%+Thoreya> and heroic raz
[2022-12-15 19:25:18] <cERIOOn> why do a MoP instance? u get shit gear there
[2022-12-15 19:25:20] <cubuzzz> easiest dungeon this season
[2022-12-15 19:25:28] <%JerrysBoBerrys> @copponex For Normal guilds sure it's fine to run in and try, But top guilds like Limit, BDGG, Echo it's all a ilvl race at the start especially this tier with all raid diffs out week one
[2022-12-15 19:25:29] <+drhobbbit> How do u check how long you’ve watched for the drop
[2022-12-15 19:25:35] <cERIOOn> low level gear in MoP instance lol

[2022-12-15 19:26:06] <cERIOOn> typical blizzard, using old instances
[2022-12-15 19:26:08] <%JerrysBoBerrys> @copponex You gotta remember it's a Marathon not a 100m dash, sure you can go guns blazing at the start but you'll get stuck super hard, so best to grab all gear possible then prog
[2022-12-15 19:26:10] <themaliciousrabbit> @cERIOOn either trolling or living under a rock
[2022-12-15 19:26:21] <themaliciousrabbit> doesn't play wow, pops into RWF "why run MOP dungeon"
[2022-12-15 19:26:25] <%+Thoreya> is everyone trolling or

[2022-12-15 19:26:25] <cERIOOn> why old instances?
[2022-12-15 19:26:26] <themaliciousrabbit> Pepega
[2022-12-15 19:26:34] <Atanyar> dunno, ask blizzard
[2022-12-15 19:26:42] <+spaeltchenbtw> @cERIOOn How is it typical ??? when have they done this
[2022-12-15 19:26:49] <%JerrysBoBerrys> @cERIOOn They're in the M+ rotation this season
[2022-12-15 19:26:50] <themaliciousrabbit> They use old dungeons because they have tons of dungeons they can cycle through
[2022-12-15 19:26:58] <FreshMunck> who needs a tank LUL
[2022-12-15 19:27:02] <dnadifference> @hughjasses type it in chat
[2022-12-15 19:27:03] <%+Thoreya> because they made tons of dungeons and its stupid af to not reuse them
[2022-12-15 19:27:05] <themaliciousrabbit> This lets them take 4 of the 8 dragonflight dungeons and then 4 old dungeons
[2022-12-15 19:27:06] <rektyynoob> @hughjasses i have 2 exams for tomorrow if that makes u feel better LUL
[2022-12-15 19:27:08] <%+Thoreya> not a hard concept
[2022-12-15 19:27:12] <themaliciousrabbit> so next M+ season will be 8 completely different dungeons

[2022-12-15 20:38:41] <Nervosu_> it is group loot in raid right?
[2022-12-15 20:38:41] <baldkap> @spaeltchenbtw oh for real? I was gonna say none of his ui looks like elvui at all, not a single element is elvui lol

[2022-12-15 21:04:55] <Feinton> @lowencsgo yes past 2 days have been huge gearing efforts usually by the time they start mythic in previous races they would be Full hc gear, this time there are barely scratching ilvl of start HC gear

[2022-12-15 21:05:23] <Feinton> which means they are incredibly undergeared compared to previous races and if mythic is tuned somewhat the same as previous they will be hardstuck on first dps check

[2022-12-15 21:25:17] <aruac> axeumBlush
[2022-12-15 21:25:21] <thelion2211> are they started Mytic?
[2022-12-15 21:25:26] <Maikki123> @Van_Klinken Do you think after months of planning they dont have a solid plan how they will execute their proggress?
[2022-12-15 21:25:33] <herbert_hiesl> yes, mythic. they are plastering the war through the bosses. *rolleyes*
[2022-12-15 21:25:39] <%bzk1_> it's wow classic heroic
[2022-12-15 21:25:43] <Van_Klinken> I do lol but feels strange not to even try it
[2022-12-15 21:25:50] <Hsbaernd> @Maikki123 good point.

[2022-12-15 21:26:44] <%Nakujin_> @Van_Klinken i mean they don't want to do like 2 bosses and then go back to splits i think, so better do a few splits more and then go through mythic
[2022-12-15 21:27:16] <Maikki123> I doesn't have any effect who kills the 7 bosses first in mythic. 8th one counts :)
