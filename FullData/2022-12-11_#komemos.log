[2022-12-11 15:09:32] <Vehuel_1515> me too. Qiqi was my first on standard and Keqing on first venti banner...wasn't even knowledgable about rerolling kek

[2022-12-11 15:10:44] <@%puriprinny> @DIVERSION_UK youre pretty new to the game yeah? theres an artifact system in game where you can equip your characters with those and buff their attack, but you can just focus on having fun for now i think
