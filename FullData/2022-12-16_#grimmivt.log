[2022-12-16 01:15:05] <@%^Nightbot> Gaspar is Grimmi's Twin! When they went in the haunted house and when it got spooky they got separated. Neither of em aged for 90 years so that's why they look young. There's still a debate on which is the evil twin. The world may never know~ grimmi14Squibby

[2022-12-16 02:17:25] <TitansBaneYT> I always found Bloodborne‚Äôs lore more interesting than other souls games simply because of the use of its gothic themes and cosmic horror.
[2022-12-16 02:17:30] <%FTLOG_IamDave> this stream is so crunchy its making me want salsa
[2022-12-16 02:17:30] <%swiftnade2> Hot take eldenring was the exact same gameplay wise as the last 5 souls game, the only difference was that lore was much more boring to learn
[2022-12-16 02:17:42] <Darkmega97> The stream can have a little bit rate as a treat
[2022-12-16 02:17:44] <SaiaiChan> incorrect
[2022-12-16 02:18:01] <SaiaiChan> you can jump
[2022-12-16 02:18:08] <@%Extrafuzzy> Sekiro is my favorite souls game
[2022-12-16 02:18:16] <%Ulu_Threk> @swiftnade2 He thinks Dark Souls had a dedicated jump button with I-Frames
[2022-12-16 02:18:17] <%FTLOG_IamDave> hot take: none of these animatronics are hot
[2022-12-16 02:18:18] <%totallydifferentusername> @swiftnade2 based
[2022-12-16 02:18:19] <%swiftnade2> Just parry :)

[2022-12-16 02:19:12] <%swiftnade2> @ulu_threk jump is functionally the exact same as dodge rolling
[2022-12-16 02:19:23] <SaiaiChan> Sekiro is hard because you can't just overlevel everything
[2022-12-16 02:19:27] <Darkmega97> You're a pro gamer Grimmi
[2022-12-16 02:19:38] <%BotFodder> Elden Ring is probably a good entry point
[2022-12-16 02:19:42] <%FTLOG_IamDave> you should stream a really quiet and relaxing game like super hexigon or doom
[2022-12-16 02:19:44] <TitansBaneYT> Dark Souls 1 is my favorite. I prefer the slower pace and gameplay like Demon‚Äôs Souls.
[2022-12-16 02:19:44] <+christheghosthost> blood born is good cause you get a bloody gun and shoot all your problems away
[2022-12-16 02:19:56] <%swiftnade2> Sekiro was way different than the other games gameplay wise, I LOVED it
[2022-12-16 02:19:59] <%Ulu_Threk> @botfodder It is tge easiest

[2022-12-16 02:20:24] <%BotFodder> Elden Ring embraces the cheese; it can be won using mostly strategy and RPG building tactics.
[2022-12-16 02:20:30] <Darkmega97> They want to be buddies, they just want to stuff you in a suit before that
[2022-12-16 02:20:35] <%FTLOG_IamDave> my favorite part of bloodborne is when you get the blood and borne it all over the place
[2022-12-16 02:20:35] <SaiaiChan> that just means you like fancy hat men more than armor boys

[2022-12-16 05:00:00] <SaiaiChan> scott probably wrote one of the stories but unless we get the credits we don't know who wrote which
[2022-12-16 05:00:10] <%code_phoenix410> "daddy daddy I wanna get pregnant by a fnaf character as well! "
[2022-12-16 05:00:24] <%code_phoenix410> probably some kid after reading this
[2022-12-16 05:00:50] <+killerkan350> Wasn't there a whole controversy about Scott being socially conservative because he's a Christian?  Why did he put his name on a book where there is mpreg and torture/suicide and market it to children?
[2022-12-16 05:00:53] <!%socialistOtter> wiki says it's written by Elley Cooper?

[2022-12-16 05:38:38] <%LoremasterofSotek> I must admit I'm morbidly curious of the people who saw Grimmi reading this story and went "...yeah, I would like to Follow for more please."

[2022-12-16 05:40:23] <Darkmega97> it was... something
[2022-12-16 05:40:24] <%RomeoEchoDelta> I will literally never forget it.
[2022-12-16 05:40:26] <!%voltchuckleflumpkinsbunny> It was a Grimmi expirence alright

[2022-12-16 20:57:56] <%$Tempest_52> One of the lights on my keyboard burnt out and now I have to throw the whole thing away I cannot deal with this
[2022-12-16 20:57:57] <Robert_Brown_> So you have multiple keyboards prepared with different switches.
[2022-12-16 20:58:00] <@%Extrafuzzy> my friend builds his own keyboards and he has a test keyboard with different switches
[2022-12-16 20:58:05] <%SethwMad> Sometimes you're feeling tactile sometime you're feeling linear. Sometimes a bit boxy.
[2022-12-16 20:58:13] <%Jraie> I could probably  do that
[2022-12-16 20:58:23] <@%Extrafuzzy> satisfying like one of those fidget toys

[2022-12-16 21:28:19] <%+SevenDrunkenKnights> i learned recently that apples you buy a the grocery store can be up to a year old. they get coated in some perservative and go into deep freeze for serveral months
[2022-12-16 21:28:24] <%k_yama_> most ridiculous one in japan would be like $4000USD for a single strawberry

[2022-12-16 21:28:41] <+ragnyaaaaa> The author was Alexandra David-N√©el and this is from the Tulpa wiki: "She said she had created such a tulpa in the image of a jolly Friar Tuck-like monk, which later developed a life of its own and had to be destroyed. David-N√©el raised the possibility that her experience was illusory: "I may have created my own hallucination", though she said others could see the thoughtforms that she created."
[2022-12-16 21:28:41] <!%GinjiVitis> @Nyanomancer it worked from Trump
[2022-12-16 21:28:54] <%$Tempest_52> @SevenDrunkenKnights It makes sense apples are only available fresh a very specific time of year
[2022-12-16 21:28:55] <!%$Nyanomancer> I'd eat a 4k dollar strawberry
