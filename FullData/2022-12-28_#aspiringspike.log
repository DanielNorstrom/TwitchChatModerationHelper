[2022-12-28 16:23:14] <+KarenDoesThings> fires is a fun idea to explore but also its important what are you double-spelling with when you put down fires? all there is are two t3 planeswalkers, an o-ring, a wheel that ends your turn, and a bounce spell.

[2022-12-28 17:08:18] <%+MarkChalice> I liked storm herald because iit had been 2 turns since archon. opp didn't have either solitude or endurance then, so; it seemed worth it to go for the win. opp only had 1 mana open, so they would have to have pitch.

[2022-12-28 17:34:55] <+iamchineseguy> I think storm herald would be better if it costed 1 less mana and had hex proof
[2022-12-28 17:35:03] <%+expansionexplosion> They should unban Faithless Looting, it would only be good in this deck.
[2022-12-28 17:35:20] <%fourdeltavictor> I think storm hearld would be better if it was a 1 mana 2/1 that created treasures when it damaged your opponent
[2022-12-28 17:35:28] <%fourdeltavictor> maybe you could dash it too
[2022-12-28 17:35:33] <%Blademan69er> beats!

I would get if it were edgy or ironic, but considering you really worship it has made me harshly reconsider my viewership. Perhaps in the future should you reconsider your position you may earn my priceless follow back, but certainly not today mister!!!

To me, this is a grievous oversight that must be immediately rectified. Please add this card to your deck forthwith or I will be left with no recourse but to unfollow. Again, the card I am suggesting you add is collective brutality. Thank You.

[2022-12-28 17:57:17] <@%+CurdBros> Ben Stark said that he would rather play against a hall of famer than an FNMer because it so hard to figure out with the FNMer has or how they play
[2022-12-28 17:57:18] <Random_user_1> honestly I kinda like opp line of "maybe they shit themself about Endurance, I can't possible beat T2 archon"
[2022-12-28 17:57:25] <DanroMTG> I mean it's a bad fake out right because we most likely don't have a better line than persisting

[2022-12-28 17:57:50] <%+bwinggniwb> I think there’s a difference between “not assuming they are punting”
[2022-12-28 17:57:53] <liontank> Even if they are not thinking as smart as you, they could still make the correct play
[2022-12-28 17:57:54] <+mattmanw2> We should absolutely test this over a long time period and see the results
[2022-12-28 17:58:04] <+mattmanw2> Because I’m p sure it’s the opposite
[2022-12-28 17:58:05] <Random_user_1> I don't think it was even a mistake, they can never win against T2 archon with no board
[2022-12-28 17:58:07] <%+bwinggniwb> And not overindexing on them tapping their mana to cast what they can cast

[2022-12-28 18:10:11] <%Aquinas9> @cranshinibon Legacy is by far faster. If you want to see turn 1 and turn 2 combos, Legacy is the place. But there are plenty of control decks and hate pieces that keep games going for a VERY long time.

[2022-12-28 18:11:48] <+mattmanw2> Does your brewing process start with the card or the portmanteau you make out of a cards name?
[2022-12-28 18:11:51] <%Aquinas9> @cranshinibon Legacy has a ton of fast mana (sol lands, chrome mox, grim monolith, mox opal, lotus petal, spirit guides) which make 3 drops like Trinisphere and Goblin Rabblemaster a lot better because you can play them on turn 1. The proliferation of fast mana may be the biggest defining feature that makes certain cards strong in Legacy but unplayable in Modern.

[2022-12-28 18:14:39] <%Aquinas9> @cranshinibon Turn 1 Sheoldred with counter backup is a completely different animal than a turn 4 Sheoldred. Sheoldred is generally much better in Legacy/Vintage where players are playing Brainstrom/Ponder/Griselbrand/Echo of Eons to draw lots of cards per turns.

[2022-12-28 19:32:13] <TheVGLand> I feel like its missing a 1 mana draw 2, discard 2.
[2022-12-28 19:32:15] <%Goody_Phil> Maybe just the singleton phantasmagorian as an unmarked grave target
[2022-12-28 19:32:34] <+ferrandynamo> and supplier

[2022-12-28 19:33:03] <liontank> Could even run diabolic intent for incidental value
[2022-12-28 19:33:09] <+ferrandynamo> i was also just thinking a 1-mana creature for vengevine
[2022-12-28 19:33:10] <%+TurnPikeBear> could this be an asmo steelseeker shell?
[2022-12-28 19:33:12] <rosewalrus> Could you play grief instead of fury
[2022-12-28 19:33:16] <@FourDogsInAHorseSuit> phantasmagorion? no. Haunted dead. yes!

[2022-12-28 19:33:49] <+Nauseea> you can discard them
[2022-12-28 19:33:53] <TheVGLand> When are they gonna print Mini Phtantasmogorian? Instead of discard 3, maybe 1 or 2
[2022-12-28 19:33:54] <rosewalrus> I mean after you bring back the phantasm you can then pitch it to grief
