[2023-01-10 08:51:35] <raiteixiii> thats the most logical reason really
[2023-01-10 08:51:38] <%infraine> I just realized Icarus doesn't bring anything new to the table, just be a skill reset bot for Saki A1 and discharge bot for Alyss A1
[2023-01-10 08:51:39] <!ItsAshTray> finally not tower of frosts? X to doubt
[2023-01-10 08:51:42] <sakurayyds> tbh 10% DMG increase is so trash for a6
[2023-01-10 08:51:43] <Bull3t_M4n> i saw gateoo clip of Icarus had global dmg numbers? whats the context there?
[2023-01-10 08:51:48] <%lonewolfliulang> when they see sales being shit they will start putting back the numbers on new toons lol

[2023-01-10 12:44:53] <no1py> Kyrios said the drop chance of the boss matricies is like 2%, some say its about 5%, but even in that case you would need like 20 keys per drop if you arent super lucky, so like 10 weeks and for 4 pc like 10month (if you dont get any dubs), so the new matricies are not realistic what so ever
