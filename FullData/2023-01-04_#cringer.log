[2023-01-04 13:45:04] <%$SlowPsycho> 1440p streaming - which you can pay an extra $5 a month to view?
[2023-01-04 13:45:14] <%+TUFOM> I tried 1440p streaming on youtube. its glorious
[2023-01-04 13:45:32] <%Soviet666> I'm still on 720p
[2023-01-04 13:46:00] VIEWERS: 230
[2023-01-04 13:46:05] <djuice_> If they do allow 1440p or higher streaming, they would probably only limited to the the top 10% of partnered streamers. The cost of bandwidth and server storage would increase alot.
[2023-01-04 13:46:25] <%SiriusSion> I watch streams on a Portraited monitor
[2023-01-04 13:46:36] <%$SlowPsycho> My thought was that Twitch Prime originally allowed ad-free viewing, then not. Then the Amazon Music which allowed you to listen to whole albums in order on Prime.... now £7.99 a month or it's shuffled.
[2023-01-04 13:46:41] <ellife> djuice_ id happily take 1440p thats not 60frames :D
[2023-01-04 13:46:43] <djuice_> They can't have everyone streaming at 1440p or that would kill their bandwidth, and VOD storage
[2023-01-04 13:46:49] <%xReadyAimMissx> @djuice_ you can stream at 1440p on twitch now, but people don't really have enough bandwidth for it to make sense.

[2023-01-04 13:47:30] <djuice_> xReadyAimMissx Yeah I know, but its limited to 6/8Mbits. The quality is pretty bad at the limited bandwidth

[2023-01-04 13:48:43] <djuice_> I hope that add the AV1 codec encoder too, so people with less bandwidth can get similar quality to those streaming at higher bitrate on H.264/5

[2023-01-04 13:50:15] <djuice_> AV1 hardware encoder now available on all the newer GPUs from Intel, AMD and Nvidia. So I hope more streaming service takes advantage of it, since it lower their bandwith/bitrate requirements for higher quality. I did know Twitch did test it earlier last year, but that was it.

[2023-01-04 14:19:30] <+thrumbonumber5> the fact the oruist sign doesnt have english
[2023-01-04 14:19:37] <%studglx> Got it
[2023-01-04 14:19:37] <+thrumbonumber5> means it probably isnt close to a main city
[2023-01-04 14:19:42] <+thrumbonumber5> tourist*
[2023-01-04 14:19:46] <%studglx> That makes sense
[2023-01-04 14:19:55] <ellife> the 41 sign was pointing to route, so possibly wasnt actually on 41, but pointing to the 41 road
[2023-01-04 14:19:56] <+niedellan> does the highway sign has km/miles?
[2023-01-04 14:20:10] VIEWERS: 271
