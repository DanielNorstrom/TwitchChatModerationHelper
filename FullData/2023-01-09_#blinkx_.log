[2023-01-09 14:37:46] <Plexxiglad> yes indeed. But fat is always evenly spread out all over your body - and certain part based on genes- but loosing arm fast is just about overall weight gain. But indeed you can tone it, but that's it. It won't just go away
[2023-01-09 14:37:47] <+firneclase> nah you just lose muscle mass, and are more likely to be gaining fat if you're sedentary

[2023-01-09 14:45:52] <+supreme1337> i'm serious though - you can see how doctors have been doing bo ob lifts for decades, but are still new to BBLs. a good bo ob job is unnoticeable nowadays, but all forms of bu tt lifts and implants look terrible
[2023-01-09 14:45:52] <%Queza2> You can get pretty sick from implants to if you are unlucky.
[2023-01-09 14:45:53] <%dgm_86> some booty implants look weird indeed. But they won't burst, modern implants are made out of a gel not liquid
[2023-01-09 14:46:01] <@%BadGamerDan> it wouldn't surprise me

[2023-01-09 16:18:20] <somebloketwitchin> I'm not sure it's a fair comparison. Harry as inane as it all is to me, his message is more about why he, as a public figure is behaving the way he is. That people want to know is why he's explaining it.. if he kept quiet he would have no path of recourse and should the privileged be deprived that just because of their privilege?

[2023-01-09 16:28:24] <FrankAbsinthe> I met Prince Harry in a McDonalds and I was so excited to meet him. I asked him for an autograph and he spat at me and turned to his friends and laughed. Then the cashier told him his 23 Happy Meals were ready and I watched him stamp on every single one and then leave on his segway
[2023-01-09 16:28:35] <+BritishB4stard> as a moral question, regardless its crass
