[2022-12-10 08:34:27] <ZazorokXIV> Best gold is in Classic Saturated

[2022-12-10 08:34:37] <+Venom_Nightstar> I actually figured out that Prime Gold is best from the Saturated Classic
[2022-12-10 08:34:38] <Dexaldem> A good Gold color is in the Orokin. If you're looking for Bronze, I'd try the Fire of Halloween color packs.
[2022-12-10 08:34:39] <%Dopiestshark> saturated is a good one. but halloween colors

You can go to their website at https://7tv.app/ to install it (including mobile). You may need to refresh/restart your browser if they don't show up after that! SilverNoted

[2022-12-10 08:56:33] <Dexaldem> Strangledome is amazing when you're doing Defense in a single room with no additional floors... It's miserable anywhere else, but it's still ana amazing breathcatcher for CC.

[2022-12-10 08:58:20] <Dexaldem> Warframe's maneuverability is indeed nutto. It's the biggest hurdle to overcome when getting into the game, but once you've gotten the hang of it, you'll be bouncing in every direction. It's so satisfying.

[2022-12-10 11:18:03] <zero8_mono> TBH I'm kind of just waiting on Soulframe
[2022-12-10 11:18:06] <Zernach> more recent Warframers, is Ash Blade Storm builds still viable, with the massive bleed stacks you can do?
[2022-12-10 11:18:07] <$shadowbryce009> I love how bullet jumping wasn't supposed to be in the game lol
[2022-12-10 11:18:08] <altrn_> im sure it is fun but it does feel overwhelming since i logged in once last week or sm
[2022-12-10 11:18:08] <Miano_SEA> You should get voruna, really fun and the recent buff made her better
[2022-12-10 11:18:09] <%+Necrosage> anyone remember stamina? Kappa

[2022-12-10 11:18:13] <atomicspazz1> @silvervale are you gonna play this often? or is this a one off?
[2022-12-10 11:18:15] <$RedRovaeden> I just realized. You get 50 platinum for free when you start playing the game, and you're allowed to trade at Master Rank 2. So, by using the warframe market website, you can find a prime frame in early game. Wish I new this when I started lol.

[2022-12-10 12:02:13] <Miano_SEA> Yeah, a bit rough for frames like yours
[2022-12-10 12:02:16] <kailladame> its BAD for the 28.

[2022-12-10 12:02:37] <kailladame> the 28 test is hard AF.
[2022-12-10 12:02:42] <Deras94> you can practice as many times as you want, you can only test once every 24h
