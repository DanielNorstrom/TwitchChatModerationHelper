[2022-12-19 14:38:11] <%bing0pajamas> is that 8 billion to you or 8 billion total?
[2022-12-19 14:38:12] <%LtMurloc> 8 Biliion? with a B? ddHuh
[2022-12-19 14:38:31] <%LtMurloc> not even Alexander dead is worth as much as Twitter to you?! D:
[2022-12-19 14:38:39] <%Faladryn> @prof_unwissend yeah I know. Not only in Germany, everywhere
[2022-12-19 14:38:39] <%ottobhollaatme> A honest president? as an american i can't even imagine
[2022-12-19 14:38:43] <%IshiiNikko> snoop dog did a poll for if he should be the ceo xD
[2022-12-19 14:38:46] <%Mellon_> if he steps down Jared Kushner will be installed
[2022-12-19 14:38:50] <%Hail_Lucy> @Faladryn yea that's true, honestly I'm not looking for higher degrees cause that takes time and money and I'm not interested, but I respect people who do and your field seems interesting too
[2022-12-19 14:38:50] <%blood_red_mike> good morning fellow kids
[2022-12-19 14:38:51] <%prof_unwissend> atleast ur not greedy nico, 8 billion is reasonable
[2022-12-19 14:38:54] <@%DexExorcist> Anyone played disco Elysium? mopCorn is good?
[2022-12-19 14:38:56] <%$fluffyjesus666> but surely he'll still be the owner? So the next CEO will work for him and he can still tell them what to do
[2022-12-19 14:38:57] <%$raithian25> and he said "I will abide by the results." He had previously done a poll about unbanning the journalists that he banned and he "abided" by those results too
[2022-12-19 14:39:00] <%blood_red_mike> thanks for a gift sub @snakefighter !

[2022-12-19 14:40:10] <%ottobhollaatme> @dinossindgeil As an American having a honest president is unthinkable
[2022-12-19 14:40:20] <%+prisonerbae> There‚Äôs no way Elon is not going to appoint personnel in a way that‚Äôs going to return twitter to the way it was
[2022-12-19 14:40:34] <d0nnerheim> 1. step: fire thousands of workers 2. step: resign
[2022-12-19 14:40:37] <%+PyeThorn> why not elon for president
[2022-12-19 14:40:37] <%Mellon_> impossible to have an honest leader
[2022-12-19 14:40:40] <@%DexExorcist> Same thing
[2022-12-19 14:40:41] <%ottobhollaatme> @dinossindgeil it was a joke sorry if my sarcasm fell through the text
[2022-12-19 14:40:52] <%$originalgengar> no jokes NOPERS
[2022-12-19 14:40:53] <%blood_red_mike> I heard that it will be illegal to promote other social media platforms on twitter, so I believe it means that you may be banned if you write "i saw on tiktok something"
[2022-12-19 14:40:58] <!%TurtleArmyJess> @ottobhollaatme try adding Kappa
[2022-12-19 14:40:59] <%prof_unwissend> have u guys seen the tweet from musk that said "Those who want power are the ones who least deserve it" i mean, didnt he wanted the power over free speach like a month ago? KEKW
[2022-12-19 14:41:02] <%Mellon_> Elon cant be president KEKW

[2022-12-19 14:42:36] <%$Kimlicious27> To be fair while he did pull some bullshit into effect at least he brought to light how badly corrupt parts of twitter were especially when it came to children's safety and doxxing. Basically if you had an in with someone at twitter you were untouchable Hmmm
[2022-12-19 14:42:36] <%Omnievul> Hey dino! I just reached Malenia in my run and I am getting my ass pounded big time. I came here to watch you be better than me and unwind from all that unsolicited buttsecks
[2022-12-19 14:42:46] <%thedee88> @blood_red_mike no they literally made it into policy lol but I don‚Äôt know how long it will last since Twitter Support deleted the tweets about the policy

[2022-12-19 15:16:47] <HereticMoon> hi all
[2022-12-19 15:16:49] <%PouringRayn> You'd probably need 20 flasks with Pebble at +0. LUL
[2022-12-19 15:16:51] <!%TurtleArmyJess> glintstone pebble is used by a lot of people throughout the game, but idk how it is without upgrading int
[2022-12-19 15:16:52] <HereticMoon> which boss are we stuck on now
[2022-12-19 15:16:56] <tightwindows> rock sling is best if u can use it
[2022-12-19 15:16:58] <%meinMestar> pebble GIGACHAD
[2022-12-19 15:17:02] <%+xSpoonman> I think pebble does the most damage in terms of mana efficiency.
[2022-12-19 15:17:12] <%+Retsofm> sup @dinossindgeil how's it hanging??

[2022-12-19 15:21:14] <%meinMestar> wiki KEKW  From the Debate Parlor Site of Grace, you can reach the rooftops leading to the floor above the Church of the Cuckoo through the courtyard. Turn west as you exit the debate parlor, climb the broken stairs, and jump off the west side of the balcony to a staircase below. Head down the stairs to unlock a shortcut, then back up and off the south edge of the balcony onto the rooftops.

[2022-12-19 17:22:27] <Ixdex1> one playthrough, seven, who's counting
[2022-12-19 17:22:29] <InitialDVolvo> for as cheap as it is, it's a great, great game

[2022-12-19 17:25:26] <%+The_Professor_Grant> @InitialDVolvo not me i thought it was easier to fight the bosses normally because you do like no dmg on horse and i dont have what it takes to fight a boss for 20 minutes
[2022-12-19 17:25:38] <%+rogerdandy> maybe only one rot?
