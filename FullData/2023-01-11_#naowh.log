[2023-01-11 11:55:59] <%+koruge7> @B3nbu there some people that is very rude. Haste is important on VDH because reduce CD on Fracture. The more fracture, the more fury and fragments, the more resources you generate, the more you live.
[2023-01-11 11:56:03] <Rikosi> @Rikosi Do you trigger his toxicity?
[2023-01-11 11:56:28] <pybus2> @B3nbu also from wowhead:  Haste: This stat increases the proc rate of nearly everything in the game, aside from traits and trinkets that provide stats on proc. It also reduces the cooldown of Immolation Aura as well as the recharge rate of Fracture and Demon Spikes, and reduces the global cooldown by up to a maximum of 100%, from 1.5 seconds down to 0.75 seconds. However, it continues to reduce other cooldowns beyond that as well as increasing proc rates with no limit, so it does not get worse

But most people has recently met Naowh and his stream and is learning. Some other people just joined stream and have a question that was previosly answered but he didn't listen, and most of the time they ask on the chat you respond very rude in ways like "go to wowhead, go to discord..." instead of just saying "haste does X" and thats all. I insist, don't wa

[2023-01-11 14:59:18] <%UntameablePear> I know why pala is not good. You see, in Shadowlands we was in the lands of shadow, so paladin could light up the shadow and be good. In dragonflight, we have dragons and they fly and they also spit fire, and fire is light, so the paladins cant light up the stuff and be good so instead they are bad
