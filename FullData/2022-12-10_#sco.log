[2022-12-10 20:28:13] <+sir_pigalot> im tentative about this
[2022-12-10 20:28:34] <+Chaydex> quick question, which shaman spec would be good for raiding as an off spec, I'll be rolling resto as a main spec since I like healing. Also is Method recruiting in EU?

[2022-12-10 20:35:34] <+quick0321> Nothing beats WoTLK
[2022-12-10 20:35:54] <CosmoJaeger> The Legion one was sick too

[2022-12-10 20:36:12] <+The_Mane> The Alliance character silently handing the horde one the weapon when fighting the Panda is top tier.
[2022-12-10 20:36:29] <CosmoJaeger> for its time, the Outlands cinematic was sick too
