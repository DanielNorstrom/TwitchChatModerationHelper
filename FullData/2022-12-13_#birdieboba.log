[2022-12-13 04:27:57] <@%kdlutz> OH @BirdieBoba there's a setting on 7TV or something i use that makes every other line in chat an alternating colour, so it makes it way easier to read chat
[2022-12-13 04:27:57] <%iggybobiggyboo> SWEET MERCY

[2022-12-13 04:43:35] <!%Meowtroid> Sen might also be a reference to "thousand" as in "house of a thousand traps"

[2022-12-13 04:44:22] <@+LKChaoui> @Meowtroid This theory claims the japanese name to have been badly translated, and that "Sen" means "thousand" in Japanese, although the in the Japanese version, the fortress bears the "センの古城" name, which translates to "Sen's Old Castle", in which, "Sen" is definitely a name.

[2022-12-13 06:30:57] <Thelothuo> can always wait until after stream to follow
[2022-12-13 06:30:58] <%the_ol_regular> I dunno
[2022-12-13 06:31:00] <@%kdlutz> if they put the lurk command in they wanted people to see
[2022-12-13 06:31:01] <%SpooksyVT> I think thanking is good

Visual snow causes letters to blur together making it hard for Birdie to read out loud.

[2022-12-13 07:34:47] <Hellspawn_Godfather> Opinion: if you're not still living with your parents and you still feel like you need to delete browser history, you should reevaluate your relationships.

[2022-12-13 07:36:07] <Hellspawn_Godfather> If you're living alone, if you're living with a partner, if you're living with a close friend... if you feel like you still have to delete your history then it's probably best for you to either decide if you trust this person enough to know this stuff about you or if you need to change what you're doing.
