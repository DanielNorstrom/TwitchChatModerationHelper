[2022-12-31 18:08:50] <halagachak> All the good stuff was the free patch
[2022-12-31 18:08:52] <%$J0rmunn> high expectations or just a dud? or both?
[2022-12-31 18:08:53] <@%$Asiak> It was this big old thing
[2022-12-31 18:08:55] <serion___> The fact that it takes you out of the game by dragging you into a court room is its biggest sin imo
[2022-12-31 18:08:57] <GarionTheFirstOfHisName> It had so much potential, but no much there
[2022-12-31 18:08:57] <@%$Asiak> right at the start of the DLC cycle
[2022-12-31 18:09:05] <ChromeViper> with like 10 events that repeat
[2022-12-31 18:09:07] <ChromeViper> KEKW
[2022-12-31 18:09:11] <@%$Asiak> and they climbed up this hill to make 3D shit and it sslowed down the DLC cycle

[2022-12-31 18:09:15] <%Naorji> the culture rework that came with the free Update for that dlc was better then the dlc
[2022-12-31 18:09:16] <%Jormungander1> would have been fine for free LUL

[2022-12-31 18:17:19] <$Panderrific> @thebosslevel nah, the 2 games are v different, rimworld is a survival game, df is just a simulator
[2022-12-31 18:17:19] <%UniMatrixJohnny> Midnight Suns just had a ton of performance issues

[2022-12-31 18:18:20] <+Panda_c260> the callisto protocol wasn't very buggy, it had a stuttering issue that was fixed in 10 hours and that was the only bug I had
[2022-12-31 18:18:21] <%NotThatBright> for AAA, indie was amazing
[2022-12-31 18:18:26] <serion___> They even managed to "bug" the patching process with regards to the day 1 patch :D

[2022-12-31 18:37:00] <%Shi__Nobi> ariW
[2022-12-31 18:37:02] <%Arazaki> hard to watch as well

[2022-12-31 18:37:10] <%TheJingerbeard> it was a buggy mess for me :(
[2022-12-31 18:37:13] <Ka0t1c1985> the new one is so bad
[2022-12-31 18:37:30] <GarionTheFirstOfHisName> What Defines a stream killer?
[2022-12-31 18:37:30] <$Panderrific> i want an actual remake of sr2, not the modern over the top in your face version of the franchise
[2022-12-31 18:37:33] <thebosslevel> @lardutch I was just happy someone said 2 cat lol

[2022-12-31 18:37:54] <%LunaArashiha> what why is that a stream killer
[2022-12-31 18:38:02] <%sshen13> too many ppl streaming it maybe
[2022-12-31 18:38:04] <Lardutch> @thebosslevel good times
[2022-12-31 18:38:04] <%Mendan> huh? Darktide was great
[2022-12-31 18:38:06] <GGuts> I can see why
[2022-12-31 18:38:07] <+Firnaf> cringeEyebrow
[2022-12-31 18:38:08] <%PhatNinja_2k> lol chat was too busy playing it themselves to watch
[2022-12-31 18:38:08] <@%xMiragen> Think it's just very far from the content people are used to
[2022-12-31 18:38:09] <thebosslevel> @cringer I was here, not typing, because I loved ur DarkTide streams
[2022-12-31 18:38:11] <%UniMatrixJohnny> I love the Total War Warhammer games, but I hate Darktide.
[2022-12-31 18:38:12] <%craigh_2k> Viewership drops like a rock is why
[2022-12-31 18:38:13] <GarionTheFirstOfHisName> Dark tide is a lot of fun to play
[2022-12-31 18:38:13] <Alissander> That game, like all Fatshark games, needs 1-2 years more
[2022-12-31 18:38:14] <$Panderrific> anything warhammer is niche
[2022-12-31 18:38:16] <%Shmookle> this is one of those kind of games that I'd rather play it myself than watch it.
[2022-12-31 18:38:25] <%jamabama42> I feel like it might have gotten better viewership if you played a different class
[2022-12-31 18:38:26] <%+Inkognyto> Also remember, many people also streamed it.
[2022-12-31 18:38:26] <%Mendan> oh yeah, probably because so many people were streaming it
[2022-12-31 18:38:27] <thebosslevel> @cringer well most viewers here for the 4k gamea
[2022-12-31 18:38:27] <GGuts> It's not very entertaining after the first hype is over
[2022-12-31 18:38:32] <%LunaArashiha> i loved watching you and arkard and little man playing it
[2022-12-31 18:38:34] <@Belannaer> Putting together 40k model right now :D
[2022-12-31 18:38:38] <%mikkeos> That game is not much fun to watch.
[2022-12-31 18:38:38] <%NotThatBright> saturated
[2022-12-31 18:38:39] <%mutopian> to me it's a game to play, but not watch others play
[2022-12-31 18:38:46] VIEWERS: 718
[2022-12-31 18:38:51] <%Soviet666> is it an intercessor Belannaer
[2022-12-31 18:38:58] <%UniMatrixJohnny> @Cringer you should check out Dark and Darker if you've never heard of it. Better version of that type of game imo.
[2022-12-31 18:39:03] <thebosslevel> I was hype for cringer Ogryn, js dtldabFistpick
[2022-12-31 18:39:07] <%^StreamElements> Two new sites up to check out: Cringer's Mastodon server: https://gaming.rip | Cringer's new blog/website: https://www.strategy.rip/
[2022-12-31 18:39:07] <%gamerclint> it's well documented chat cringeHAHA
[2022-12-31 18:39:13] <%mikkeos> Your interaction with little man and Acrard was fun, but watching the game itself, not so much.
[2022-12-31 18:39:16] <+WhatToPlaay> it really is a stream killer for me.
[2022-12-31 18:39:17] <%+jstubbles> Cringeys burkeClap
[2022-12-31 18:39:19] <@Belannaer> @Soviet666 I'm actually converting 40k version of Vilitch from fantasy
[2022-12-31 18:39:24] <%LazyStrass> I liked your costreams for that game. But there was so much competition at that moment. Many of my streamer played that right when you were on
[2022-12-31 18:39:30] <%Soviet666> oh snap Belannaer that sounds cool
[2022-12-31 18:39:33] <thebosslevel> yeah this is defona good category
[2022-12-31 18:39:34] <+0Toust0> it was way too saturated, everyone was playing it
[2022-12-31 18:39:34] <%trivialmind> Do you have any idea how Darktide performed for other streams? I know I prefer to *play* Darktide than watch it be played.

[2022-12-31 19:24:51] <%$Serenity557> DF devs chose to release in december, knowing full well they only had a limited amount of time to fix any potential issues that might hurt their chances at the Cringey awards so I think they're okay with being 5th.
