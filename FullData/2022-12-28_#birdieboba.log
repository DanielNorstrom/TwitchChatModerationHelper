[2022-12-28 05:38:02] <SilencerVoV> for me its more about the mouth movement quality
[2022-12-28 05:38:02] <%+mdkubit> For me personally? There's a specific 'artstyle' that's rarely used anymore, it was used in the 90s for anime El Hazard OAV series.
[2022-12-28 05:38:04] <%LeiaFrey> Im absolutely in love with your style. Ive been looking at your artist for myself honestly.
[2022-12-28 05:38:04] <%SpooksyVT> I like most styles, but I think more unique ones are super cool
[2022-12-28 05:38:07] <%meltycandies> not to dunk on less experienced artists, l2d is very tricky to figure out!
[2022-12-28 05:38:15] <Yasika> honestly its whatever fits the streamer for me
[2022-12-28 05:38:33] <%+Octonomicon> I think a model/style that feels unique and matches the personality is best
[2022-12-28 05:38:33] <%Sanyometer> I don't think I have a favorite style, but as far as models go, yours is prob my favorite
[2022-12-28 05:38:33] <anhdres1> You are the best as r
[2022-12-28 05:38:33] <@%OkamiDarakino> mmmm, I been likeing a lot of experimental models (horror vtubers)

[2022-12-28 05:38:41] <+Issrune> your model is very eye pleasing, I like it. i love the colored feathers behind the ears, it helps catch my attention

[2022-12-28 05:38:48] <iszabael> i've been teaching myself live2d over the last few weeks
[2022-12-28 05:38:48] <%Kaga_MeIMeI> it's hard to say. If I recognize the artist who made the model, I generally like them
[2022-12-28 05:38:51] <Yasika> like there are some streamers i love that still do pngs
[2022-12-28 05:38:51] <%SpooksyVT> Live 2d makes brain hurt

[2022-12-28 05:39:03] <%meltycandies> i do love seeing a good toony model, i also love when a model has gimmicks tbh? like mouseys newest model having snowglobe horns
[2022-12-28 05:39:11] <Vafarien> u r unique
[2022-12-28 05:39:12] <%lostonessouls> @BirdieBoba I don't go based off of style really. I go more off of personality....however I do tend to notice I lean more towards Korean/Vroid style.
[2022-12-28 05:39:20] <%lonneythellama> Nice, like what do you meaning by a mouth upgrade, more better to fit what you‚Äôre saying?
[2022-12-28 05:39:20] <+OurDudeistPriest> hiii
[2022-12-28 05:39:26] <%meltycandies> but im not going to straight up avoid distinct styles

[2022-12-28 06:12:02] <+FedeOfIT> kinda lewd xD
[2022-12-28 06:12:02] <%Kaga_MeIMeI> vampire survivors is a fun game,too
[2022-12-28 06:12:05] <%Sanyometer> mobile game with butts
[2022-12-28 06:12:09] <+FedeOfIT> it has...interesting angles
[2022-12-28 06:12:10] <Vafarien> it's a meme game with good story surprisingly
[2022-12-28 06:12:10] <iszabael> of course that was the question nihmunEye
[2022-12-28 06:12:12] <@%kdlutz> its about jiggling butts basically
[2022-12-28 06:12:15] <strutnuts> butt game
[2022-12-28 06:12:21] <%UncleRichard_> Huge butts
[2022-12-28 06:12:23] <+Ches_Neckbeard> vampire survivors is the most value you'll ever get for a 5$ game
[2022-12-28 06:12:23] <JubalVoid> thinnk it's a mobile gacha? so kinda lewd by default
[2022-12-28 06:12:24] <@%kdlutz> the biggest

[2022-12-28 06:13:03] <JubalVoid> @GroundPounderofMoms as expected

[2022-12-28 06:13:14] <%Stylomax> I know, Birdie's favorite game was Choo Choo Charles

[2022-12-28 06:13:23] <%another_weasley> Battle Brothers because I love getting my hopes crushed
[2022-12-28 06:13:27] <+FedeOfIT> I think mine was...destiny 2 but...do I actually enjoy the game or just because I mindlessly play it? leabunWheeze
[2022-12-28 06:13:33] <%SpooksyVT> In that case Bloodborne
[2022-12-28 06:13:33] <%Yasika> oh? what dark souls?
[2022-12-28 06:13:39] <+FedeOfIT> actually...no, my favorite might be "just act natural" xD
[2022-12-28 06:13:40] <%stravagevt> don't get the trainz plus unless you want to play with surveyor 2.0. Classic Surveyor might be a challenge. because of the User Interface and being able to find what you need.
[2022-12-28 06:13:44] <+FedeOfIT> that game was fun every single time
[2022-12-28 06:13:52] <%Yasika> yes! first one is great
[2022-12-28 06:13:52] <%mdkubit> My favorite game to watch Birdie play this year was Oblivion during the subathon after certain gummies were consumed. :D
[2022-12-28 06:13:54] <%Frostwriter111> Valheim was my favorite game this year

And I'm in extreme pain. I have it elevated so it doesn't cause as much pain and I took some ibuprofen for it. Imma watch a movie with boyfriend and then get some sleep, but I gotta wait for him to get back, so Imma hang here for a minute.

[2022-12-28 06:32:27] <@%kdlutz> the 1st one is my actual most played game so i cant wait for number 2
[2022-12-28 06:32:34] <%mdkubit> Armored Core is a mech game. :)
[2022-12-28 06:32:41] <%+Task230> Dark souls Mech game
[2022-12-28 06:32:44] <%KirinTheEmpress> Its a mech mission game made by FromSoft
[2022-12-28 06:32:44] <@%kdlutz> armored core is another fromsoft IP
[2022-12-28 06:32:44] <%mdkubit> Build mechs and blow each other up. :D

[2022-12-28 06:32:57] <%mdkubit> And it's usually as hard as Dark Souls since it's the same dev, FromSoft. :)
[2022-12-28 06:32:59] <%SpooksyVT> Totally forgot armored core was fromsoft
[2022-12-28 06:33:04] <leowolfwalker> what's your favorite game

[2022-12-28 06:33:33] <%mdkubit> Yeah, in fact, Armored Core on the PS1 was hard at that time when it came out. Before Dark Souls, we had AC. :D
[2022-12-28 06:33:41] <xxdemonicduoxx> it might keep the open worldness, at least i hoep it does
[2022-12-28 06:33:42] <%+atom1116> sons of the forest is the sequel to the forest horror game
[2022-12-28 06:33:44] <@%AsamiCrescent> Alice madness returns is one of my all time favourites and I do yearly replays
[2022-12-28 06:33:45] <Hellspawn_Godfather> Do you like Metroidvanias?

They are traditionally depicted with both human and avian (bird like) characteristics. Birdie is 50% human, 50% Tengu, and a 100% gremlin. Also those are horns on her head, not panda ears.
