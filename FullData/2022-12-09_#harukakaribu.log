[2022-12-09 22:55:54] <%CapriKornus_> ramen is the best
[2022-12-09 22:55:55] <Kronksterpher> the quality of sushi might be deterimied by the distance you live from the ocean
[2022-12-09 22:55:56] <%arbiter58> It's always a texture thing for me.
[2022-12-09 22:55:59] <%wolfpackmn> Ramen i need to find a recipe
[2022-12-09 22:56:01] <%thekingrulz9090> You might not have found the right kind.

[2022-12-09 22:56:17] <+RighteousDevil> Once I microwaved a hot dog with a natural casing at 1 AM. The boiling juices inside split the casing, and it made a sound like a child screaming. Cue my roommate bursting out of his room and into his kid's room... It's a funny story we tell now, but at the time I was the only one laughing. nyannUho

[2022-12-09 22:56:27] <noctis_3d> Some sushi placers rock, other sushi places suck. Cold semi-hardened drying rice ruins the experience and texture.

[2022-12-09 23:43:45] <%$JBW00dward> @HarukaKaribu Scara is a great set up character. You can use characters that add additional elemental attacks and they react for huge damage
[2022-12-09 23:43:46] <Vex_Ahlia_CR> he cant succ like venti tho rooLewd
[2022-12-09 23:43:46] <+Razputin217> Power creep is real
[2022-12-09 23:43:49] <Thorin5> he and venti serve different roles
