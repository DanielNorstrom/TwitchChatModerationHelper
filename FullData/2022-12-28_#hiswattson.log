[2022-12-28 16:44:02] <+birdhousebmx> It's because it was his place of work. The court found that the woman provided an unsafe work environment, therefore money was rewarded

[2022-12-28 17:46:28] <+nozbrun0> ttraffic at once
[2022-12-28 17:46:30] <%+Lanoyo> @HisWattson it's because the server was only allowing them enough bandwidth for the small amount of viewers they have
[2022-12-28 17:46:31] <@%BESTGlRL> it might be a cpu thing
[2022-12-28 17:46:33] <+ZeniorAlive> limitation of band\
[2022-12-28 17:46:34] <@%$turtleTiff> twitch probably allocates resources based on traffic
[2022-12-28 17:46:38] <+Maxadelphia> on raids its probably just because theres a huge influx of traffic at once
[2022-12-28 17:46:39] <%$theemonalisa> kuushi1Wiggle kuushi1Wiggle
[2022-12-28 17:46:40] <cskthegr8> cuz they dont have enough memory alloted to their stream
[2022-12-28 17:46:41] <@%phkn_jenny> @MikeGK91 it was fine cept i got sick for 2 days
[2022-12-28 17:46:41] <%oZAXo> stuff like alerts, chat etc all are still client side
[2022-12-28 17:46:45] <PurpleFX> also if they have alerts for follows
[2022-12-28 17:46:45] <Mrpeppar> if you are partner you get more bandwithch it adjust with viewers all the time . @HisWattson
[2022-12-28 17:46:46] <proonzykjns> twitch has limited resources and probably allocates them to streamers based on average viewers or something like that
[2022-12-28 17:46:46] <@%phkn_jenny> @turtleTiff it does this

[2022-12-28 17:46:59] <proonzykjns> so when something drastically shifts that space isn't properly allocated

[2022-12-28 17:47:00] <@%^Nightbot> Wattson has whiffed 433 kraber shots. Why does he bother picking it up? hiswatSip
[2022-12-28 17:47:01] <xAnxietx> You stream to twitch media servers, we connect to the web servers that then stream the media from the media server. there is literally only MS differences. We are not using your bandwidth for the stream. You do not have the bandwidth to handle that. The raid crashing other streams literally can just be the chat spam to someone with a crap PC that can't handle the load.
[2022-12-28 17:47:05] <cskthegr8> twitch aint that rich to have extremely huge servers like google

[2022-12-28 17:47:25] <Sutorman> @hiswattson maybe the smaller streamers are on a lower priority and are allocated fewer resources

[2022-12-28 19:39:12] <+Orivv> @SoapyPotatoJ There's absolutely no difference between shots fired with Heavy or Light ammo: the damage, fire rate, ballistics, visuals, and audio are all identical. Overall the CAR looks to be a very strong SMG with a very high fire rate (though not quite as fast as the R-99) and fairly decent damage too.

[2022-12-28 20:08:53] <DeletedAccount3124> @HisWattson i used to drope frames too because i switched my lan cable, try changing the port to another one, maybe put it in lan 2 on your router and restart router, it fixed the issue for me.

[2022-12-28 20:10:00] <!%Heavens_Wing> @HisWattson If you have disconnection protection on you can Alt+f4 on OBS and then reopen and it will keep your session going.
[2022-12-28 20:10:04] <dRLoaded> okay we need 383 people to leave so he doest lag
[2022-12-28 20:10:05] <hitmarkarz> im telling you, google an internet speed test and check your upload speed.
[2022-12-28 20:10:07] <%$thank_ufor_subscribing> we are at 9.k now
[2022-12-28 20:10:07] <dRLoaded> nvm we good
[2022-12-28 20:10:08] <+harryhummus> I'll come back if you restart
[2022-12-28 20:10:10] <just9ja> Its issue is UPLOAD so doesnt effect game play bro
[2022-12-28 20:10:12] <!%Heavens_Wing> It won't end your stream to do that. @HisWattson
[2022-12-28 20:10:14] <%+lamuralla11> @hiswattson do you think it has anything to do with the drops?
[2022-12-28 20:10:17] <DeletedAccount3124> @DeletedAccount3124 it's probably his upload speed, apex and discord don't require a lot of upload speed to run, i know how it feels cuz it happened to me the same way it happens to wattos.
[2022-12-28 20:10:17] <MattWho0> is it bc of OBS or Twitch?
[2022-12-28 20:10:18] <netherbrixx> what is your memory usage at in Task Manager

[2022-12-28 20:11:09] <!%Heavens_Wing> Or even use Task manager to kill the OBS session @HisWattson Disconnect protection will protect your from ending stream and you can open OBS back up and it will connect you back.

[2022-12-28 20:11:39] <!%Heavens_Wing> @HisWattson You can enable the Disconnect Protection from the Stream Settings page. Simply toggle on the Disconnect Protection preference, and make sure "Temporary Backup Image" is enabled.
[2022-12-28 20:11:46] <ekstaaz_fr> whut
[2022-12-28 20:11:47] <DeletedAccount3124> @HisWattson run a speedtest on your internet and check your upload speed, if you have 0 upload speed, i know what the problem is cuz i had the same issue. disconnect protection is in twitch settings stream tab.
[2022-12-28 20:11:56] <yourhightimber> u need ur own server like timmy at ur house
[2022-12-28 20:12:00] <hitmarkarz> drop bitrate to like 3000, you can change it while you are live. will look a little worse but may help a ton. i have the same issue at times.
