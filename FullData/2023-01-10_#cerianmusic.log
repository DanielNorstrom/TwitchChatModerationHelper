[2023-01-10 23:06:05] <%wjzijderVeld> There's a lot of different ways to teach, some kids just learn way better by example instead of focus on the why. But I'm afraid sometimes also just the "whatever keeps them engaged so the parents keep paying me" aspect sabyspCringe

[2023-01-10 23:12:49] <%colinbrain> and the reason why we say "I - V - IV" etc instead of just saying the actual chord names is because the intervals are the same regardless of the root note, so it applies just the same

[2023-01-10 23:17:35] <%colinbrain> Yeah, but the trick is that G major ain't the same notes at C major notes, so you can't just look at the white keys

[2023-01-10 23:17:37] <%KautoStar_> so this is why professionals can change key is quickly and faultlessly?
[2023-01-10 23:17:42] <Bladavia> aka the leading tone

[2023-01-10 23:17:54] <Keioel> so is there a situation where the 7th Major Chord not wouldn't be a full tone UP from the 6th?

[2023-01-10 23:18:06] <+Nastorius> @KautoStar_ it takes a bit of practice, but basically yes
[2023-01-10 23:18:07] <Keioel> Is that why it's always a half from the home note?
[2023-01-10 23:18:48] <%KautoStar_> i feel i'd have to relearn the whole song a bit to change key @Nastorius that makes sense
[2023-01-10 23:18:57] <%morgorosz> for next lesson‚Ä¶ could you deconstruct a song?
[2023-01-10 23:19:08] <%wjzijderVeld> So in a Gmaj7th, the major is about the G scale? Regardless in which key you're playing that Gmaj7? sabyspHmm
[2023-01-10 23:19:17] <Keioel> Ok cool so Major is always a half note from the home, and a 7th Chord is just normal chord progression
[2023-01-10 23:19:24] <%wjzijderVeld> That always confused the heck out of me

[2023-01-10 23:20:37] <%$Nate_W333_> this is where the meme about jazz notes being 'wrong' notes comes from... borrowed for a moment because they sound nice
[2023-01-10 23:20:41] <Keioel> so a 7th chord would have been the F

[2023-01-10 23:20:53] <Keioel> Ok cool :D

[2023-01-10 23:21:02] <Bladavia> chord7 is also known as "dominant 7th"

[2023-01-10 23:26:50] <%wjzijderVeld> We're heading into circle of fifths territory real fast now compli25Giggle
[2023-01-10 23:26:50] <Keioel> but knowing it's the distance between notes really helped me wrap my head around the difference between major and minor chords
[2023-01-10 23:27:34] <Bladavia> @keioel yeah intervals are the fundamental building blocks of music, no way around them
[2023-01-10 23:27:38] VIEWERS: 215
[2023-01-10 23:27:41] <%colinbrain> It shares the exact same notes as C, it's just where your ear wants the notes to resolve, right?
[2023-01-10 23:27:46] <Keioel> so a Minor 7th Chord would follow the same rules as the major?
[2023-01-10 23:27:50] <@%pickitupputitdown> so when you use 7ths, how does that change the songwriting from not using them?
[2023-01-10 23:28:10] <%colinbrain> Ask the Beatles
[2023-01-10 23:28:12] <%colinbrain> They use them so often

[2023-01-10 23:44:17] <%colinbrain> I've heard that the idea of major = happy and minor = sad is kind of a learned western thing, and remote indigenous tribes unexposed to western music have no strong associations with either. ü§∑

[2023-01-10 23:46:52] <%colinbrain> @Keioel There are examples of sad major songs. Like the military horn song "tap" that they play on Remembrance Day is just a major chord, but it's deeply sad because of associations

[2023-01-10 23:48:47] <Keioel> @Keioel That's fair about Taps I can see the sad implications but I also associate it with the shift from day to night since they always played it on base when the shift occured

[2023-01-10 23:49:09] <%colinbrain> The Hallelujah lyrics kind of talk about this. "It goes like this, the fourth, the fifth, The minor fall, the major lift"
[2023-01-10 23:49:16] <Utkarshg1> This is what makes song so emotional
[2023-01-10 23:49:30] <%MichouxGifts> is the scale : Ab Bb C Db Eb F G Ab ?

[2023-01-10 23:52:01] <%I_AM_HPX> I think another song that both melds well and has the same theory is City of Stars from La La Land, its almost a perfect mirror
[2023-01-10 23:52:05] <Keioel> So it's not just the chords then, the lyrics do matter @I_AM_HPX
[2023-01-10 23:52:17] <Utkarshg1> What happens if we end on suspended chord  in end
[2023-01-10 23:52:20] <Keioel> Except for Steal my Sunshine by LEM that song totally messes with you lol
