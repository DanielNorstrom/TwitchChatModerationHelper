[2023-01-08 00:20:53] <Kritikal_G> note for zach if he tries to stream again: make sure it's not the fps counter that is bugged.  had it where nvidia share was showing the fps of OBS instead of the game when OBS is open.

[2023-01-08 23:43:25] <+mydestiny114> most fans miss whisper of the worm mission
[2023-01-08 23:43:39] <%+Swiddlyy> @mydestiny114 Whisper of the worm was the best exotic mission for sure. IMO
[2023-01-08 23:43:50] <+mydestiny114> @Swiddlyy imagine a pvp map based on it
[2023-01-08 23:43:54] <+solarherculezz> postmaster will fill up too

[2023-01-08 23:44:44] <+mydestiny114> even this area could be a cool pvp map, repurposing raid areas for pvp maps would be so easy
