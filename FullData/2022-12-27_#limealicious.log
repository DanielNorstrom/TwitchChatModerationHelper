[2022-12-27 21:22:17] <%bunglinglummox> My guess re: kangaroos is that it's to do with the fact that they're grazers. If the moss on the floor is running out, and the dogs are on what's left, they'll walk up on the dogs... and then the proximity will cause scuffles.

[2022-12-27 22:58:12] <%ughdontmakemeregister> you can freeze magma with water but its tricky
[2022-12-27 22:58:17] <Sakom_Muwin> You dont, or you clear the lava out through channeling
[2022-12-27 22:58:17] <+cornwa11is> channel from above to see what's behind the wall

[2022-12-27 22:58:44] <%+JordanU> Honest answer though, you drop water on it to turn it into obsidian
[2022-12-27 22:58:49] <+Exoltik> You can designate the spaces above the lava as ponds and people will use buckets to cool the lava. Water, you can pump out or designate as a pit so they empty it
[2022-12-27 22:58:50] <%efflora> well if you're gonna be like that, dig into those gems. go on, do it

[2022-12-27 22:59:28] <%ughdontmakemeregister> if you pour water on lava fun stuff happens
[2022-12-27 22:59:37] <%+JordanU> you can make a pit and drop buckets of water into it, or use a screw press

[2022-12-27 22:59:46] <+cornwa11is> yes. you can reveal the lava to see where it is exactly and plan how to deal with it from there
[2022-12-27 22:59:50] <Stonecreek_KC> That looks like an old-school RPG puzzle map.

[2022-12-27 23:41:23] <Putnam3145> any job that causes noise will check a random spot in a 9x9x9 cube and if that spot happens to be in a cavern it increase the agitation for that cavern, which can lead to raids and forgotten beasts
[2022-12-27 23:41:24] <%$distractedcamel> LUL some forgotten beasts kaiju battled in my caverns it was sick
[2022-12-27 23:41:25] <%bunglinglummox> @guppian_dragon The trick is to submerge a few minecarts in magma in a controlled fashion, then pump it out and let it evaporate. The minecarts fill with magma, but once the tile is pumped clear you can have them carried off elsewhere in the fort. Then you can use a short track and a track stop to dump the magma wherever you want it.

[2022-12-27 23:57:27] <+autolockon> is there any reason to NOT just put each noble into their own squad and order them to stand under the atom smasher?

[2022-12-27 23:57:44] <MichelozzoOnTwitch> @Limealicious Is it the first sock's pair?
[2022-12-27 23:57:44] <sarinadragoon> TWO artifact socks? amazing
[2022-12-27 23:57:50] <%FieldMedic4077> we have a pair of fancy socks limesPoggers
[2022-12-27 23:57:51] <%bunglinglummox> @autolockon relatively few reasons
[2022-12-27 23:57:51] <!%Laimubot> OK, that is not that catchy lol
[2022-12-27 23:57:55] <Putnam3145> @autolockon nobles give therapy and are the only way you get wagons from your caravans
[2022-12-27 23:57:58] <SlipperyElm> Imagine if in LotR instead of Sting frodo had a sock that got uncomfortably wet feeling whenever the wringwraiths were nearby
[2022-12-27 23:57:59] <%+Hedobot> is one artifact sock the ferret sock? badgerHmm
[2022-12-27 23:58:05] <%$distractedcamel> limesLUL I have no idea what smashing nobles will do, but I'm assuming something awesome

[2022-12-27 23:58:39] <%bunglinglummox> @distractedcamel mostly it trades a set of annoying demands for a less annoying set of problems

[2022-12-27 23:58:48] <%$distractedcamel> LUL nice
[2022-12-27 23:58:48] <+ScrapKingKeita> they raise value of the fort
[2022-12-27 23:58:51] <SlipperyElm> Do the dwarves that made them get pissed if you sell them?
[2022-12-27 23:58:52] <%+Plasmier2K> they attract fun
[2022-12-27 23:58:59] <Takinsur> keeps dwarfs happy when they look at them i think
[2022-12-27 23:59:03] <%bunglinglummox> @SlipperyElm not if you sell, only if they are stolen or destroyed
[2022-12-27 23:59:08] <Putnam3145> the artifacts made by your dwarves? not any specific reason. treasures of the gods? yes, there's a reason to keep them. i don't think anyone's found it yet though
[2022-12-27 23:59:09] <+crusywashcloth> They attract people who want to give your axedwarfs lots of steel presents!
[2022-12-27 23:59:10] <%FieldMedic4077> it does aid with room wealth for sure
[2022-12-27 23:59:11] <%+JordanU> They instantly increase a rooms wealth, they cant be destroyed so they can have special practical uses
[2022-12-27 23:59:11] <SaucyGiraffe> keeping them is a good way to get a thief
