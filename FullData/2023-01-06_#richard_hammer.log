[2023-01-06 03:01:06] <%+badjuju518> I know Detroit river is a popular walleye river
[2023-01-06 03:01:06] <%DannyLockard> that's so wild bc the majority of my fishing has been either lil pan fish or walleye/northern
[2023-01-06 03:01:14] <%DannyLockard> but the walleye/northern has mostly been done in Canada
[2023-01-06 03:01:23] <%+badjuju518> usually early to mid spring
[2023-01-06 03:01:42] <%+badjuju518> it's more of a water temp dependant thing
[2023-01-06 03:01:58] <%DannyLockard> my dad co-owns a place in NW ontario that you have to float plane ride into. Shit is fireeeee fishing.

A player is suspended two games for his 14th and subsequent major penalty for fighting.

[2023-01-06 04:36:10] <Jilaris> she's weak to regular milk lol
[2023-01-06 04:36:19] <AC_ThirtySix> thats because store bought has high fructose corn syrup in it

[2023-01-06 06:56:05] <%Raptorez> spool size richard
[2023-01-06 06:56:13] <%Raptorez> the tagara has a 10k spool
[2023-01-06 06:56:19] <%Raptorez> the overlord only 8k
[2023-01-06 06:56:28] <%Raptorez> so the tagara takes in more line/spin
[2023-01-06 06:56:36] <%Raptorez> its longer
[2023-01-06 06:56:58] <%Raptorez> true
[2023-01-06 06:57:31] VIEWERS: 300
[2023-01-06 06:57:49] <%Raptorez> tagara is meta cuz of the "low" gear ratio + big spool size
[2023-01-06 06:58:15] <%Raptorez> the lower gear ratio helps with the mass when carp fishing

[2023-01-06 07:08:07] <%$templarofflame> tuba has been so dead trolling - it might be because ive been targeting the caspy browns so hard

[2023-01-06 07:12:07] <+RitualSauce> yeah and people like to casually drop 5 bucks at a time without realizing they've outspent that one big 400 dollar purchase
[2023-01-06 07:12:10] <%$templarofflame> imagine how much more money they would make if gold was a little cheaper overall and you could use gold to close the gap on the silver you dont have
[2023-01-06 07:12:54] <%+badjuju518> I thought I saw the biggest money maker for rf4 was bait
[2023-01-06 07:12:59] <%EpicPumaNess> if you played 8 hours a day, how long would it take you to get an end game item? just curious how the time adds up vs the money
[2023-01-06 07:13:13] <%Exlium_> it also doesn't help that fishing planet has really repetitive catching locations and day cycles
[2023-01-06 07:13:19] <%$templarofflame> oh i agree - and last i looked fishing planet has abuot 1/3rd the constant player pop
[2023-01-06 07:13:41] VIEWERS: 306
[2023-01-06 07:14:00] <%EpicPumaNess> 107 hours.... for just a reel huh? that's crazy
[2023-01-06 07:14:03] <+RitualSauce> this game have a bit over double the 30 day player average of fishing planet
[2023-01-06 07:14:19] <+RitualSauce> and is gaining vs losing players
[2023-01-06 07:14:36] <%$templarofflame> i really want more fancy fishing poles. but i kind of feel like i should get that fancy knife
[2023-01-06 07:14:48] <%EpicPumaNess> so lets just round that up to 150 hours or so for one  piece, for 1 rod, and it seems like you can use three rods at once with all the gear
[2023-01-06 07:14:55] <%$templarofflame> to start stacking crayfish (if i ever find them) mussels etc
[2023-01-06 07:15:02] <+SpaxX1978> what is going on here
[2023-01-06 07:15:16] <+SpaxX1978> realyy
[2023-01-06 07:15:21] <%$templarofflame> see i really want to get a UL setup
[2023-01-06 07:15:25] <+RitualSauce> naw its a video game in reality
[2023-01-06 07:15:27] <%$templarofflame> but i just spent my money on a UL
[2023-01-06 07:15:33] <%EpicPumaNess> that's a great way for an mmo to be tbh, I say 107 hours like its a lot, but that's only 4 ish days of play, I've got years of play time on mmo's
[2023-01-06 07:15:39] <%Exlium_> whats the benefit of an UL
