[2022-12-09 14:56:57] <%stoversp> dangHeart HeyGuys dangHug
[2022-12-09 14:59:57] <%ouranemily> hi
[2022-12-09 15:00:11] <%deathmetalguineapig> ARMORED COOOOOOOORE
[2022-12-09 15:00:22] <%ouranemily> Yay?
[2022-12-09 15:00:39] <%stoversp> HADES 2
[2022-12-09 15:00:43] <%ouranemily> Wait until Dan plays it and he has to grip the controller in the Armored Core method.
[2022-12-09 15:00:51] <%ouranemily> WHY ARE WE ALL SCREAMING TODAY
[2022-12-09 15:01:57] <%stoversp> BECAUSE IT'S FRIDAY!
[2022-12-09 15:02:21] <%stoversp> AND LOTS OF INTERESTING GAMES WERE SHOWN LAST NIGHT!
[2022-12-09 15:02:26] <%deathmetalguineapig> ITS RAVENS STEELERS WEEK
[2022-12-09 15:02:33] <%stoversp> AND BAKER MAYFIELD!
[2022-12-09 15:02:53] <%ouranemily> Baker looks like he killed a man and is impersonating him in the Rams unis.
[2022-12-09 15:02:56] <%ouranemily> There, I said it.
[2022-12-09 15:03:08] <%stoversp> is that good or bad?
[2022-12-09 15:03:18] <%ouranemily> ...
[2022-12-09 15:03:43] <%deathmetalguineapig> worked for the Ravens and ray lewis
[2022-12-09 15:03:44] <%ouranemily> I'm trying to find the spark to be exhilarated today but I cannot, which is not good.
[2022-12-09 15:03:57] <%ouranemily> Just make sure you throw out the suit and you're good.
[2022-12-09 15:04:30] <%ouranemily> I do not think Baker would be capable of killing a man, hiding the body, and getting off scot-free.  He would get caught.
[2022-12-09 15:04:47] <%ouranemily> Then Skip Bayless would be like "A-A-Ron wouldn't kill someone to impersonate them like a pod person!"
[2022-12-09 15:05:04] <%ouranemily> ...I need help.  :|
[2022-12-09 15:05:52] <%stoversp> basiqueOZoom dangDemon
[2022-12-09 15:05:53] <%deathmetalguineapig> that trailer for Hades, nuts
[2022-12-09 15:06:03] <%stoversp> yeah, I wasn't expecting Hades 2
[2022-12-09 15:06:19] <%ouranemily> I'm looking forward to the salt content.
[2022-12-09 15:06:20] <@%^StreamElements> Hang out with Dan & the Community when the show is offline! Join the dang596 Discord:  http://discord.gg/dangheesling
[2022-12-09 15:06:28] <%stoversp> still wish dan would actually playthrough Hades, I think it'd be good pace picante
[2022-12-09 15:06:47] <%ouranemily> NGL I skipped the Game Awards.  I watched Jojo, ate ice cream, played Baldur's Gate, then watched the final few minutes of Rams/Raiders.
[2022-12-09 15:06:53] <%ouranemily> @stoversp Hates the artstyle.
[2022-12-09 15:06:58] <%ouranemily> That's why.  Doesn't like the artstyle.
[2022-12-09 15:07:07] <%deathmetalguineapig> it wouldn't , a lot of the charm of Hades is the art and character interactions
[2022-12-09 15:08:13] <%stoversp> Hades artstyle >>>>> Isaac
[2022-12-09 15:08:30] <%ouranemily> It can be... he just doesn't like it.
[2022-12-09 15:09:02] <%deathmetalguineapig> I don't disagree, but on the show it is what Dan likes to play combined with what does well. if Dan is not going to like playing a game then it isn't good for the show
[2022-12-09 15:09:16] <%stoversp> oh I agree
[2022-12-09 15:09:20] <%ouranemily> Yup.
[2022-12-09 15:09:34] <%ouranemily> Right, I'm gonna go wander the halls like a psychotic, will return shortly.
[2022-12-09 15:09:44] <%stoversp> I'd watch Dan watch paint dry if that's what he wanted to do because I know he'd find a way to make it fun
[2022-12-09 15:10:18] <123aaa789> Remnant 2 looked like it might be a game Dan would be interested in, based on my loose interpretation of the trailer and games I've seen Dan enjoy

[2022-12-09 15:22:17] <%hammwise> I am sad, in DC there are very mediocre pizza places and then very high brow snobby pizza places
[2022-12-09 15:22:18] <%ouranemily> Blaze is on the other end of town, and I got D&D tonight.
[2022-12-09 15:22:31] <%hammwise> Like, i just want a decent slice
[2022-12-09 15:22:52] <%bjwood354> dang, I would love to play D&D but nobody I know is into it
[2022-12-09 15:24:10] <%hammwise> @bjwood354 might be worth checking FB/meetup/reddit? Theres usually more around than you think if you are open to meeting new peeps

[2022-12-09 15:27:58] <%hammwise> Did anyone watch the game awards? What an odd event that was
[2022-12-09 15:27:59] <%ouranemily> It would be quite dry there.  It's not like the Fremen are chilling in Miami.
[2022-12-09 15:28:03] <%ouranemily> I did not.
[2022-12-09 15:28:03] <%deathmetalguineapig> is every day sundae then?

[2022-12-09 16:16:28] <RossDenisauce> I'm the same way Dan
[2022-12-09 16:16:32] <%subscription_steve> better than Isaac and spelunky dangDemon
[2022-12-09 16:16:36] <thebeejus> So Darkest Dungeon isn't a roguelike
[2022-12-09 16:16:37] <+carbondmetric> It's not BM it's just incorrect info
[2022-12-09 16:16:37] <%roz_paints> you can say you hate it dan
[2022-12-09 16:16:38] <RaxMobbins> based dan take
[2022-12-09 16:16:38] <%richhomiewand> like Dead Cells
[2022-12-09 16:16:39] <%Kitsunevania> Remnant 2 also looks good
[2022-12-09 16:16:40] <edaeni> Isaac is too RNG heavy for me
[2022-12-09 16:16:40] <%crowend> I think Dan is stubborn at times
[2022-12-09 16:16:40] <%average_atlas> isnt hades like tiny rogues?
[2022-12-09 16:16:42] <quasarptolemy> so is it like vampire where you pick up to 6 weapons and up to 6 accessories and just stay on the same level the whole time?
[2022-12-09 16:16:42] <%+Rabid0Rabbit> yea this game is way too put together to fit well into the roguelike category
[2022-12-09 16:16:42] <%cderhammer> plays spelunky and says there's no variety lmao

[2022-12-09 16:23:06] <Coxniffa> Idk what that means tbh
[2022-12-09 16:23:06] <8bitbarbarian> it's clearly a souls derivative
[2022-12-09 16:23:07] <+croatic777> its soullike
[2022-12-09 16:23:07] <!%justtomplease> it feels like souls with guns
[2022-12-09 16:23:08] <+thankyoufortheamazonprime> souly gun

[2022-12-09 16:23:24] <%Dovian> ???
[2022-12-09 16:23:24] <+carbondmetric> @DanGheesling It's more RE4 than Souls

[2022-12-09 16:23:47] <%RICKENJACK> looks super sick
[2022-12-09 16:23:47] <+carbondmetric> It's a RE4-like in a souls world
[2022-12-09 16:23:48] <!itscaw> it's so off
[2022-12-09 16:23:49] <%chiiiiiiiiiiiip> it's demon souls world
[2022-12-09 16:23:49] <%Bustakapp_> It's as much roguelike as hades is LUL

[2022-12-09 16:24:04] <Shlompski> atpRtsd
[2022-12-09 16:24:04] <+carbondmetric> Almost certainly not, Remnant is on rails

[2022-12-09 16:24:15] <%beardedjoe> it's worth playing
[2022-12-09 16:24:15] <%+ErinCaseyGamers> omg the term ruby on rails just brought me back to the days when i worked for a recruiting company that looked for engineers
[2022-12-09 16:24:16] <+garyoakguy> it's an amazing co op game
[2022-12-09 16:24:16] <Queginn> A bit, not as much as Souls
[2022-12-09 16:24:17] <!%stonerberg> ah yes the standard merchant "take what you want"
[2022-12-09 16:24:19] <RossDenisauce> You get some variety in weapons and equipment yeah
[2022-12-09 16:24:20] <Epytaph> I played in 3 player coop and each of us had a very different build
[2022-12-09 16:24:23] <%CelestialTemple> there was not a lot of weapon or armor choice
[2022-12-09 16:24:23] <!itscaw> I played the first one for like 30 minutes and it was nonstop talking
[2022-12-09 16:24:24] <%dan_jr> fun game that was ruined by how bad the last boss was
[2022-12-09 16:24:25] <%+big_maff> spooky
[2022-12-09 16:24:25] <JustMeCasey> You find weapons and unlock them through exploration and progression then you can create builds around them
[2022-12-09 16:24:28] <!%Tjman112> Dog
[2022-12-09 16:24:29] <%FSLGS> wow they outdid themselves with their design in this one though
[2022-12-09 16:24:31] <%OneMeanMutha> the enemies look cool
[2022-12-09 16:24:31] <%+Rabid0Rabbit> that's the critter from the cistern

[2022-12-09 16:24:40] <%Bustakapp_> Star wars looks better
[2022-12-09 16:24:40] <thebeejus> Big thing is it has good coop
[2022-12-09 16:24:40] <%DJ_Knuckles> Did Dan not like Bloodborne?  That has limited combat and more linear too
[2022-12-09 16:24:44] <%TurnOneForrest> nu pace?
[2022-12-09 16:24:44] <!%michaelbenson> the first one is great

[2022-12-09 16:26:59] <%beardedjoe> i mean i'll certainly try it out
[2022-12-09 16:27:00] <%Ayylmaozyyy> it looks like off brand souls, just generic
[2022-12-09 16:27:00] <thebeejus> I'm kind of bored of souls proliferation. It almost kept me from elden ring.
[2022-12-09 16:27:00] <%direfulpot> dangKEKW Wait I thought this was a LoTR game for a sec
[2022-12-09 16:27:00] <ahjile98> souls-like games are a dime a dozen if theyre not from soft
[2022-12-09 16:27:00] <+myneighbourscottoro> I mean it does look literally exactly the same as a souls game
[2022-12-09 16:27:00] <%Kitsunevania> 1st one wasn't good tho
[2022-12-09 16:27:03] <%Bustakapp_> Probably going to be better than the first though. Took what they learned kind of thing.
[2022-12-09 16:27:03] <%+ErinCaseyGamers> I could not believe some of the chat messages I saw when watching the game awards, makes me question humanity lol

[2022-12-09 16:27:13] <sleepmaster1011> did he look at hades 2 already?
[2022-12-09 16:27:15] <%+big_maff> everyone's trying to be so darn spooky

[2022-12-09 16:27:19] <%milkmannick0> The first one is 2014

[2022-12-09 16:27:22] <!%michaelbenson> @ErinCaseyGamers some pretty dangBro stuff for sure
[2022-12-09 16:27:23] <%vMadMatt> If a game comes out that's supposed to be like dark souls, and it's worse than dark souls, then just play dark souls IMO
[2022-12-09 16:27:25] <Meatslappers> Judas
[2022-12-09 16:27:30] <Queginn> They really just added THE to the title
[2022-12-09 16:27:31] <@%j_Wilco> Lords of the Fallen was the first game
[2022-12-09 16:27:31] <+thankyoufortheamazonprime> lords of the fallen asleep
[2022-12-09 16:27:32] <!%justtomplease> @dangheesling its confusing, this lords of the fallen is from a different studio and is not a remake
[2022-12-09 16:27:33] <sleepmaster1011> @DitonB it was only nominated for best animated show, and it did not win. Lost to arcane
[2022-12-09 16:27:36] <!%benndayho> @big_maff spooky is the new edgy
[2022-12-09 16:27:36] <RossDenisauce> I think it's entirely new
[2022-12-09 16:27:39] <%DJ_Knuckles> Surge 2 is lightyears ahead of Lords, it's so good and I'm so sad you never gave a shot
[2022-12-09 16:27:40] <%milkmannick0> It’s a reboot
[2022-12-09 16:27:40] <traitas> original did not deserve a remake
[2022-12-09 16:27:41] <%TOnYmarFiELd> maybe a reboot
[2022-12-09 16:27:44] <8bitbarbarian> look up surge 2 if you want to see their recent work...the first lords of the fallen is like 10 years old now
[2022-12-09 16:27:44] <Shlompski> no its THE lords of the fallen. not lords of the fallen
[2022-12-09 16:27:44] <%redteamgone> what's up everybody.... you guys watch Judas trailer yet?
[2022-12-09 16:27:45] <%beardedjoe> @DanGheesling did you watch the Street Fighter 6 trailer?
[2022-12-09 16:27:46] <%wampaxstompa> That’s what happened with the first one. It basically got overshadowed with it looking like a souls game
[2022-12-09 16:27:48] <+myneighbourscottoro> They did not make a remake
[2022-12-09 16:27:49] <@%j_Wilco> The new one is "THE Lords of the Fallen"
[2022-12-09 16:27:49] <sleepmaster1011> hades 2 and DS2 are the things Im most excited to play in the next 2-3 years
[2022-12-09 16:27:50] <%+asardonicsailor> PotFriend i hope twitch never removes this emote it's so important
[2022-12-09 16:27:55] <!%justtomplease> nope
[2022-12-09 16:27:57] <Coxniffa> Confusing names
[2022-12-09 16:27:58] <+thankyoufortheamazonprime> It has a different director and studio
[2022-12-09 16:28:00] <%lordgint> probably not

[2022-12-09 16:37:24] <%ouranemily> You can probably find a reproduction cart, and maybe a reproduction of manual.  Etsy would be your best bet.

[2022-12-09 16:38:26] <%RICKENJACK> and Yoshi P directed it too
[2022-12-09 16:38:26] <%Ishtaruku> Lets be real. The show was everything we wanted. Actual new (not leaked) announcement with the awards taking the right amount of time.
[2022-12-09 16:38:27] <%beardedjoe> biggest deb8. WAY too much nonsense story and not enough game if it's anything like FF13.
[2022-12-09 16:38:31] <%+Rabid0Rabbit> it?
[2022-12-09 16:38:31] <%DJ_Knuckles> Not MKG, but looks epic
[2022-12-09 16:38:31] <!itscaw> We're not watching Death Stranding?
[2022-12-09 16:38:33] <SubbedSoYouSayMyName> did Dan play Hades? What's the reaction to Hades 2 if he's seen it already
[2022-12-09 16:38:35] <%Bustakapp_> Is this dead cells?

[2022-12-09 16:38:40] <traitas> @Coxniffa honestly same LUL
[2022-12-09 16:38:40] <lorede_> is it the same composer as the earlier games? or is he still sick
[2022-12-09 16:38:41] <%+Rabid0Rabbit> i liked ten
[2022-12-09 16:38:43] <%beardedjoe> FF1/4/6 are all GOATED
[2022-12-09 16:38:43] <vicarious_kiwi> FF7, FF8 and FF10 were greatest
[2022-12-09 16:38:44] <%GyroJoestar> X was the best because it had sports in it
[2022-12-09 16:38:46] <The_Joker1793> how final can it be if there's 16 of them tho? Kappa
[2022-12-09 16:38:47] <%imMizz> Why cant FF do turn based combat anymore? Is it not allowed anymore?
[2022-12-09 16:38:47] <%Bencryption> I wish it had character customization

[2022-12-09 16:39:18] <%direfulpot> dangDEB8 how about we forget you said anything at all
[2022-12-09 16:39:18] <%Ishtaruku> What are your thoughts on Death Stranding (or Kojima in general)? @dangheesling
[2022-12-09 16:39:19] <Coxniffa> @Coxniffa But all of chat was telling him he wouldnt like it it. Its a mech game
[2022-12-09 16:39:20] <%ouranemily> I missed when Final Fantasy was turn based.  :(
[2022-12-09 16:39:20] <%DJ_Knuckles> Dan:  It's a fake Rougelike
[2022-12-09 16:39:21] <%mudokonqueen> nothing about this looks interesting/different?

[2022-12-09 16:39:24] <%ouranemily> @DanGheesling Yes and no.
[2022-12-09 16:39:27] <%dan_jr> darks souls does that
[2022-12-09 16:39:31] <%beardedjoe> small connections
[2022-12-09 16:39:31] <%+Rabid0Rabbit> its like using the same bricks
[2022-12-09 16:39:31] <Toshyano> sort of but no
[2022-12-09 16:39:31] <%direfulpot> Wrong
[2022-12-09 16:39:31] <!%ColleenKelly24> Bless you :) btw
[2022-12-09 16:39:31] <%+MrBalbian> There's load sof connections just not story ones
[2022-12-09 16:39:31] <Cattletoadz> mostly
[2022-12-09 16:39:31] <%GyroJoestar> in most cases yes
[2022-12-09 16:39:32] <Shlompski> only 10 and 13 had sequels
[2022-12-09 16:39:32] <intensefist> Wowee
[2022-12-09 16:39:35] <%StrawberryPopSharts> there's a connection on my credit card statement 🤷
[2022-12-09 16:39:36] <vicarious_kiwi> theres chocobos
[2022-12-09 16:39:36] <lorede_> good boy :)
[2022-12-09 16:39:38] <%+apolloiv1992> These games have zero character to them
[2022-12-09 16:39:38] <%spindiot> dog bait
[2022-12-09 16:39:39] <%TOnYmarFiELd> always end times but no other connection
[2022-12-09 16:39:39] <%BayesianGames> @DanGheesling Nightingale was a cool looking trailer
[2022-12-09 16:39:39] <hitoshura0> it's probably easier to do that then it is to connect them all
[2022-12-09 16:39:40] <%beardedjoe> CID is in every game i think
[2022-12-09 16:39:40] <%Bolognadavenport> How is it the final fantasy if we're on 13?
[2022-12-09 16:39:40] <%weiglgasse> just some repeating elements (like shiva and ifrit)
[2022-12-09 16:39:41] <%mudokonqueen> ppl will buy it for the dog petting. LUL
[2022-12-09 16:39:41] <thebeejus> There are some that have connection, but they're all like "Final Fantasy 10, the Second Time"
[2022-12-09 16:39:42] <Toshyano> all the gods and summons are connected
[2022-12-09 16:39:45] <+myneighbourscottoro> They just reuse monsters and some lore (like crystals are pretty common)
[2022-12-09 16:39:47] <%Dsavage94> They have recurring themes and lore elements
[2022-12-09 16:39:49] <%+MrBalbian> They reuse monsters and magic names and character names and callback a ton but the story is always a new one

[2022-12-09 16:39:51] <+crazed_terran> FF has been trash for decades.

[2022-12-09 16:39:53] <%ZelgadisGray> these character look so generic..

[2022-12-09 16:39:56] <!%raze00r> going to be amazing!

[2022-12-09 16:40:25] <%ouranemily> @DanGheesling Why not?  And it was 2 of them.
[2022-12-09 16:40:25] <%AEPage> To make people try it
[2022-12-09 16:40:25] <%groverb1> They made the first one 160 years ago
[2022-12-09 16:40:25] <%+MrBalbian> 11 and 14

[2022-12-09 16:40:26] <knowmadx> 2 MMOs
[2022-12-09 16:40:27] <Shlompski> the new mmo one is GOAT
[2022-12-09 16:40:27] <%beardedjoe> 11 and 14 are MMOs
[2022-12-09 16:40:27] <%hambuster2> no one plays Final Fantasy though right?
[2022-12-09 16:40:28] <%ouranemily> FF11 and FF14.
[2022-12-09 16:40:31] <%+Rabid0Rabbit> it fit well
[2022-12-09 16:40:31] <%weiglgasse> 11 and 14
[2022-12-09 16:40:31] <%borbagos> 11 and 14 are mmos
[2022-12-09 16:40:32] <%DJ_Knuckles> Viewfinder, I'm putting it on the line
[2022-12-09 16:40:32] <8bitbarbarian> dark souls MMO would be dope
[2022-12-09 16:40:35] <!%benndayho> I always think FF would be awesome if you were in control of actually doing what they show.
[2022-12-09 16:40:35] <!%SodaPara> DS4 MMO dangPOG
[2022-12-09 16:40:35] <%+asardonicsailor> ffxiv is probably the best mmo i've played ever it's so fun

[2022-12-09 16:40:36] <%GyroJoestar> 11 and 14 were both MMOs, I absolutely loved 11 and played it for like 15 years
[2022-12-09 16:40:36] <intensefist> i would play souls mmo
[2022-12-09 16:40:38] <%JibbyJabs> why do people still preorder games at all?
[2022-12-09 16:40:39] <%+MrBalbian> It's like Star Wars Old Republic being KOTOR 3
[2022-12-09 16:40:40] <%AEPage> It's bad marketing for the series, but good marketing for the MMO
[2022-12-09 16:40:41] <lorede_> elden ring could TOTALLY work as an mmo tbh
[2022-12-09 16:40:41] <!sbosco22> It uses the same themes and ideas.

[2022-12-09 17:51:03] <TriadOrion> It means that you might have good intentions, but you do something terrible with good intent and that's *not* good

[2022-12-09 17:51:20] <spawnnpc> bad deeds usually have some good intentions to justify them.
