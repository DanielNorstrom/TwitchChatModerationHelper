[2022-12-10 22:39:14] <%EasySqueezy01> Most members of the imperium are kept as in the dark about chaos as possible to the point if they are even near chaos worship they’ll be killed so it’s highly unlikely the zealot knows that Khorn worshippers say that

[2022-12-10 23:47:52] <@%Doormatt> Yeah you gotta set it in the schedule. Usually the second option, Staggered training, is good but it will take them over for like a season

[2022-12-10 23:49:24] <Karneolius> they'll do individual drills in their off time, but setting them to training will have them spar, which is much faster

[2022-12-10 23:50:47] <@%Doormatt> I would atleast dig until you are hitting *mostly* stone and then try down from there
[2022-12-10 23:50:52] <%scrimbingus> If it's a light aquifer you can handle it pretty easily tbh

[2022-12-10 23:51:45] <%BestyVT> safest to keep the inn separate since guests can be... rude, in rare circumstances
[2022-12-10 23:51:46] <Yleshphitrium> The dinning hall can serve as a meeting area
[2022-12-10 23:51:47] <@%Doormatt> Meeting hall/Dining hall is probably fine, but keeping it separate from the tavern is probably a good idea

[2022-12-10 23:57:32] <%BestyVT> easiest to buy them from a caravan :)
[2022-12-10 23:57:35] <@%Doormatt> I still refuse to make them myself. Fuck it, I'll buy them
[2022-12-10 23:57:35] <!%Laimubot> ah i see its potential but all of your farmer struggling with people?

[2022-12-10 23:57:44] <Karneolius> it's better to buy instruments, but the dwarves are very good at beatboxing

[2022-12-10 23:57:52] <%+vaGnomeMagician> Is it normal for your lead dwarf to conduct a meeting in a one by one stairwell
[2022-12-10 23:57:55] <%ToasterWings> ruh roh
[2022-12-10 23:57:59] <%orbitaltuna> is that aquifer?
[2022-12-10 23:58:00] <+SplotchDog> replace the walls and you'll be fine
[2022-12-10 23:58:06] <%BestyVT> aquifers are infinite you need to smooth the wall or replace them with constructions
[2022-12-10 23:58:07] <%thatcrazycrabs> "We're okay! (Narrator: They were in trouble)"
[2022-12-10 23:58:07] <%Dima3z> dwarves know everything they need to know when they are born
[2022-12-10 23:58:09] <%$Grahfvitnir> @vaGnomeMagician in my experience, yes.
[2022-12-10 23:58:10] <%JoJo0217> vargDorf no

[2022-12-10 23:58:41] <%thatcrazycrabs> @Vantagor This is my contribution to the chat
[2022-12-10 23:58:42] <%+JC_pls> you can force dig out a little area, wall in the area, then dig down and just never dig that layer again

[2022-12-10 23:58:47] <%+vaGnomeMagician> @vaGnomeMagician He has a newly built LARGE office, so i think hes just bragging about his new office at this poiunt.
[2022-12-10 23:58:48] <%zman12380> Go north instead of west?
[2022-12-10 23:58:53] <%+vaGnomeMagician> The greedy bastard.
[2022-12-10 23:58:54] <kippy_uvu> !aaa dog
[2022-12-10 23:58:59] <Karneolius> soils can't be smoothed though, you'll have to replace those with walls
[2022-12-10 23:59:10] <%+JC_pls> you chopped a tree there
[2022-12-10 23:59:10] <%OneManAgainstheOdds> wood floats, limes

[2022-12-10 23:59:52] <%BestyVT> it's a light aquifer so you can deal with it, if it was a heavy aquifer you'd need a complicated pump set-up
