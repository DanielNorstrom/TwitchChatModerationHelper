[2023-01-05 17:18:05] <%dershbag> @dershbag @privatemocococo I joined a gym two weeks ago! My wrestling will only take me so far. Still need to work on some guard passes and other fundamentals. The weight thing is really just a preference for where I think I'll feel most comfortable competing. In school I wrestled at 182 lbs. Now I'm 29 at 220 so I think I'd be more comfortable at the 202 or 194 class.

[2023-01-05 17:25:17] <+GoNnaBeLaTe> Also why is their an account cap? So many at 160 that should be increased greatly or removed as well.

[2023-01-05 17:25:43] <%SWAN_R0NS0N> everyone knows 160 is the biggest number
[2023-01-05 17:25:56] <%SWAN_R0NS0N> 160 is the cap of everything
[2023-01-05 17:26:10] <@%MichaelxVoorheees> it used to be 30. they dont do anything with account lvl. raising is just as pointless. and you cant remove it becuz its a ranked requirement

[2023-01-05 17:28:02] <ironxposidian> There should just make some of the higher ranks available to X amount of people and if you aren't one of those people, you gotta get more points to surpass someone to up a rank

So it's something that the devs will just be forever working on and it will probably never be truly fixed.

[2023-01-05 17:35:03] <%SWAN_R0NS0N> @MichaelxVoorheees Yeah I stayed alive I just expected to die 2v1 lol

[2023-01-05 17:35:34] <+imfishhdude> @dershbag Until they make SMITE 2. KekL
[2023-01-05 17:36:04] <%+ravendore394> hey dumb question but does scorp do something besides give gold and xp?
[2023-01-05 17:36:04] <mori_encore> I think server issues r one of the reasons smite fails in regions other than NA.

[2023-01-05 17:36:20] <%+Andy1134> can we at least get smite 1.0
[2023-01-05 17:36:20] <%+lightforceten> When is smite 3?
[2023-01-05 17:36:23] <mugi1wara> then smite 3
[2023-01-05 17:36:24] <%SWAN_R0NS0N> the sequal to everything will always be "xxx 2 electric boogaloo"
[2023-01-05 17:36:35] <%+TruePlewd> man, I really enjoyed s7 and s8 SPL, but the season was so dull
[2023-01-05 17:36:41] <@%+schwarzpastor> okay but what about SMITE 1.313 repeating of course
[2023-01-05 17:36:41] VIEWERS: 579
[2023-01-05 17:36:42] <+GoNnaBeLaTe> What happens to HiRez if Smite 1.0 dies off? They have any other  games with a real following?
[2023-01-05 17:36:48] <%jaxonjaxoff1> Smite 3, the only moba to skip its sequel
[2023-01-05 17:36:49] <%+hookedcaptain> smite 3: search for the sequal
[2023-01-05 17:36:50] <@%Ignis_Lupus_> @Incon I mean, imo it just seems like the best answer at this point is just rebuild from the ground up since the base coding for Smite is so borked
[2023-01-05 17:36:52] <%+Jagsman119> For april fools one year hirez should make the home screen say “smite 2”
[2023-01-05 17:36:55] <%worldclassscrub> No smite 2 that’s like telling a kid there is no Santa. How dare you sir
[2023-01-05 17:36:58] <%dershbag> @GoNnaBeLaTe not really
[2023-01-05 17:37:02] <%+lightforceten> Smite 360, we’re doing xbox naming rules
[2023-01-05 17:37:16] <%+acraine1> The window to make smite 2 is long past. Shoulda taken advantage of the player spike in 2020 to get smite 2 going and re do some net code. Now there is no way hi rez has the capital to donoty
[2023-01-05 17:37:21] <+samummy1> @gonnabelate does smite have a real following
[2023-01-05 17:37:26] <RCX0dus> poor calvin
[2023-01-05 17:37:40] <+GoNnaBeLaTe> So if Smite dies HiRez dies?
[2023-01-05 17:37:49] <%siv0r> this time where SmiteGame is only streaming during major events has been SO nice
[2023-01-05 17:37:54] <+GoNnaBeLaTe> @samummy1 Then where else is their income coming from aside from Smite?
[2023-01-05 17:38:09] <+imfishhdude> @GoNnaBeLaTe Not necessarily.
[2023-01-05 17:38:36] <mori_encore> Idk how smite is lowkey unknown in asia moba is supposed to be super popular here

[2023-01-05 17:39:02] <+GoNnaBeLaTe> @mori_encore Probably because they don't spend $$ to advertise it.
[2023-01-05 17:39:06] <%dershbag> @samummy1 I mean they have other games but none with a following like smite.

[2023-01-05 17:41:48] <%dershbag> @GoNnaBeLaTe Hi Rez has already admitted several times that they know the server issues are due to bad netcode but that code is so ingrained in the original code that reworking/fixing it will be a forever task. So it's something that the devs will just be forever working on and it will probably never be truly fixed.
[2023-01-05 17:41:49] <%+Jagsman119> Are you sure the biggest marketing expense isnt more Slipknot collabs?
[2023-01-05 17:41:51] <@%MichaelxVoorheees> @gonnabelate they lcant. its a bse net code that was skipped on corners cuz the never expected the game to last. they dont have or want to spend the time rebuilding the entire game

[2023-01-05 17:43:14] <%dershbag> @GoNnaBeLaTe @GoNnaBeLaTe like I said, it will be a "forever task." It doesn't matter when they start on it will be something that will forever have to be worked on.
[2023-01-05 17:43:19] <mori_encore> Maybe they can pay AI to fix it lol @jagsman119

[2023-01-05 17:43:51] <+imfishhdude> I didn't understand the Slipknot collab. Does someone in the band play the game?
[2023-01-05 17:43:57] <%+TruePlewd> @gonnabelate to add to what @michaelxvoorheees said, it's also legacy code from a previous team. Working on bad legacy code with no one from the original team to help is hell and would honestly need the current team to record the entire game from the ground up
[2023-01-05 17:43:58] <+samummy1> Does smite pay people for the colabs

[2023-01-05 18:12:12] <smaug_the_glover> We had a class set of books in my anatomy class and but the books still had to be checked out in a students name. At the end of the semester someone had stole my book and the school made me pay for a book I never saw once in my life

[2023-01-05 18:13:05] <+Troywolfe> one time i forgot to take an online final, so the next day i emailed the prof and asked if i could still take it and he was like "yeah idc"
[2023-01-05 18:13:07] <%dognus88> passing with a 0 on a 40% final just to flex on professors

[2023-01-05 18:13:14] <%+Andy1134> was this an Arkansas school
[2023-01-05 18:13:22] <%+acraine1> @incon i had an online final that ended at 12pm but i thought it was 12am. Logged on at 1pm to take the exam and it was closed and they wouldn’t let me take the exam
[2023-01-05 18:13:33] <%+poll0_loc0> @anikate Nah me and 2 other friends would rotate going to class to catch this stuff
[2023-01-05 18:13:51] <Inixxious> I fortunately had the opposite experience in my calc 3 class.   Had a 99% in the class before the final, then I failed the final exam big time, but my professor still have me an A for the class cause he liked me and knew I put in genuine effort to the class lol.
[2023-01-05 18:13:56] <%+cthuwhu> that is irritating. my husband couldnt attend classes due to unforseen circumstances and if they did that to him he would have failed

[2023-01-05 20:11:03] <%psychictoad_> and the shooting
[2023-01-05 20:11:07] <+hennyc33> Avatar has never been a strong story movie. if you want breath taking visuals its for you but story is trash

[2023-01-05 20:11:53] <%dershbag> The story is pretty good but there was one discrepancy with a character that a lot of people were like "WHY"
[2023-01-05 20:11:53] <%looster412> I saw it at a tuesday matinee for like $12, and that's what it's worth

[2023-01-05 20:12:21] <%psychictoad_> @Incon if you can, try watching it at better quality in the theatre. like i saw it twice, second time was the 120gz option where the quality bump was very noticable

[2023-01-05 21:57:15] <+willyd333> The titans have just dealt with insane injuries 2 seasons in a row on top of a gm who we now fired missing on so many moves and our offense is ATROCIOUS. Our defense is good and coach is good so I'm hopeful but a potential 7 loss streak to lose the division is possible this weekend which is sad
