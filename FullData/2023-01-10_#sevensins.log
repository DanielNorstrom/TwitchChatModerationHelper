[2023-01-10 09:16:50] <~%SevenSins> the rotation is less complex, mostly the elimination of goring blade

[2023-01-10 09:17:18] <~%SevenSins> just build the potency into the melee attacks and get rid of it entirely
[2023-01-10 09:17:19] <~%SevenSins> smh

[2023-01-10 09:17:53] <%+ReimHikari> you can now move and use instacasts of holy spirit every combo rotation
[2023-01-10 09:17:57] <~%SevenSins> breaks the first buffer combo hit but whatever, QOL over anything

[2023-01-10 11:53:22] <%Neobullseye> Gotta say, this was such an epic moment compared to the original. The original has one shock shot, yes, but otherwise it's just two screens of climbing (with some annoying map architecture and silly battery puzzles) and boom, you're already done.

[2023-01-10 12:18:43] <%Neobullseye> Of course, the said auto-revive accessory tends to be ludicrously rare, but still.

[2023-01-10 13:39:08] <%Retaliator_NL> I think it would be cool working ofr shinra.
[2023-01-10 13:39:28] <%+Drakorious> @TidusZecht i feel the same, would explain why cloud doesnt harm him
[2023-01-10 13:39:28] <@%+Mike410459> I guess people normally run around and kick chairs. Cause not a single person is batting an eye when you do it.

[2023-01-10 14:00:01] <%Retaliator_NL> There's a difference with and without intent. Same goes with Murder actually. If you kill someone with intent you'll be in jail longer than if you didn't intent to before hand.  Same goes for things like this, if you're deliberately being a dick to spite other people, then the concequences are usually higher than when you unintendedly hurt someone.

[2023-01-10 14:16:09] <%straymuttstrut> yeah that cut scene was new to me
[2023-01-10 14:16:11] <NovaAmadeus> the cringe just flows from all dirge characters lmao
[2023-01-10 14:16:13] <%oldandflexible> same here never seen that
[2023-01-10 14:16:13] <%+yeroon> i wonder how they are going to do leveling, if you can or cannot import a save, what is going to be max level etc. Too many questions that i will know the answer to when it gets released :)
[2023-01-10 14:16:15] <%TidusZecht> weiss is a character introduced in dirge wasn't he?
[2023-01-10 14:16:16] <MeSharkk> that wa svery out of place
[2023-01-10 14:16:18] <!%+yrvengalied> @yrvengalied i think this is where they start Part 3 on an intense hype moment the Escape and end it on a big feels moment in Part 2

[2023-01-10 14:16:24] <%XyFreak> there's an additional superboss fight that you can fight against now (in hardmode)
[2023-01-10 14:16:33] <%Lonefellow> You'd think it's way more important than it is
[2023-01-10 14:16:33] <%oldandflexible> i think that comes with DLC
[2023-01-10 14:16:39] <%+yeroon> yeah, they added some extra scenes to intergrade
[2023-01-10 14:16:47] <%XyFreak> the fight is SUPER HARD btw... >_>
