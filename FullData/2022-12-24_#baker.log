[2022-12-24 20:57:10] <%+TrickmasteH> The main issue with NESW it is narrow minded in terms of how the mechanics work. It works for somethings but its not as universal as the x3 method. There is a reason it was created, it works in more scenarios and then with +1 etc.
[2022-12-24 20:57:21] <%+TrickmasteH> Its an oversight by anyone who thinks its a good method.

[2022-12-24 21:19:46] <VIRUSplw> i think i can play only my main for long time and keep up, i still got 10 free gs from gear transfer and honing +12-17 is not that bad

[2022-12-24 21:28:54] <copium_addict> how did it go? did aoe overlap?
[2022-12-24 21:28:54] <%+TrickmasteH> too many aoes and it actually requires dmg.
[2022-12-24 21:29:06] <+Azzijin> on my sorcs I do diamonds
[2022-12-24 21:29:13] <%+TrickmasteH> yyea reaper / deadeye are best options
[2022-12-24 21:29:15] <%+TrickmasteH> for this party

[2022-12-24 21:29:59] <%+TrickmasteH> I wound't subject myself to the pain of jailing myself due to 42bar shape mechanic with no proper single target dmg..

[2022-12-24 23:09:50] <%+Arwya0203> gunslinger is such a cool class
[2022-12-24 23:09:57] <+thenuttyprof> i have fun n im shite lol
[2022-12-24 23:09:58] <%polig> you wait ill beat his deathblade

[2022-12-24 23:10:07] <%Renektolijus> not cuz the class was difficult or something

[2022-12-24 23:10:15] <+Caedes55> i made my gunslinger alt at least 6 months ago and benched her at 1435. im just now getting to a point where i feel pretty good at it and i kinda want to hone her up now
[2022-12-24 23:10:19] <copium_addict> and when i do i will die irl and uninstall game
[2022-12-24 23:10:51] <%Renektolijus> gs is good when you get to know the knack of her
[2022-12-24 23:10:52] <%polig> but tbh deadeye is worst alt you can get
[2022-12-24 23:11:01] <%+Arwya0203> gs is just hard because you have so many spells to track
[2022-12-24 23:11:03] <%polig> and i feel a lot of them new deadeyes are alts
[2022-12-24 23:11:04] VIEWERS: 513
[2022-12-24 23:11:07] <%+Arwya0203> and then 3 stances to switch
[2022-12-24 23:11:30] <+Caedes55> ya i would CONSTANTLY swap to the wrong stance and get myself killed
[2022-12-24 23:11:40] <%polig> that is why i went a lot of deadeye alt so i can get muscle memory in
[2022-12-24 23:11:40] <@%^Streamlabs> because it's the best.
[2022-12-24 23:11:44] <%+FireZky> u can always play time to hunt make is bit easier
[2022-12-24 23:12:00] <%+FireZky> it*
[2022-12-24 23:12:00] <NorGara> well basically every burst class is hard, because you need to know when you have dmg windows

[2022-12-24 23:12:03] <%polig> i knew class is going to be super hard so i either play a lot of same or fk it
[2022-12-24 23:12:12] <%+Arwya0203> gs was my 3rd alt, 2nd was my wardancer that is benched at 1445 KEKW
[2022-12-24 23:12:36] <%+Arwya0203> hell no KEKW
[2022-12-24 23:12:47] <%+FireZky> i actual started with gs
[2022-12-24 23:12:55] <%+FireZky> But then i got bored stance switching
[2022-12-24 23:12:58] <%+FireZky> and start play sorc
[2022-12-24 23:13:03] <%polig> gunslinger is hard but not even close to reapers or deadeyes though
[2022-12-24 23:13:04] VIEWERS: 513
[2022-12-24 23:13:16] <%polig> i feel like reaper is hardest imo
[2022-12-24 23:13:33] <%+Arwya0203> reaper has 0 defensive
[2022-12-24 23:13:42] <%+Arwya0203> you are nearly 1hit from every attack
[2022-12-24 23:13:48] <copium_addict> i have a perfect depression in my main 6, she's prob the most satisfying playstyle ive tried but i can imagine playing her in brel gate 3 for example
[2022-12-24 23:13:51] <NorGara> therefore I got both setups, reflux sorc for learning raids, switching to igniter after I learned everything I need to know
[2022-12-24 23:13:58] <copium_addict> cant imagine*
[2022-12-24 23:14:01] <%polig> yeah but you got to do dmg too
[2022-12-24 23:14:25] <%polig> when i saw that dude doing all those combos on training dummy im like you either god or you aint doing any of that in raid xD
[2022-12-24 23:14:32] <%polig> with reaper
[2022-12-24 23:14:49] <%+Arwya0203> reaper is just like gs, muscle memory imo
[2022-12-24 23:14:59] <%+Arwya0203> i think im getting better aswell on it
[2022-12-24 23:15:00] <NorGara> well and I sometimes also like the kinda braindead playstyle of reflux sorc LUL
[2022-12-24 23:15:04] VIEWERS: 513
[2022-12-24 23:15:20] <%polig> well reaper needs to hit 2x amount of buttons though xD
[2022-12-24 23:15:21] <copium_addict> i switched from demonic and its so good, way higher ceiling/burst
[2022-12-24 23:15:27] <+Caedes55> haha my main is piano reflux and i love it way more than igniter. def doesnt do as much damage later in the raids, but im mvp in prog usually. also 1492 prokel easy
[2022-12-24 23:15:45] <%polig> while being close range class too
[2022-12-24 23:15:49] <%polig> and back attack
[2022-12-24 23:15:58] <%+FireZky> @Caedes55 What engravings u run ?
[2022-12-24 23:16:05] <+thenuttyprof> i believe this game is about enjoying yourself, cos if u aint then maybe u should find another game
[2022-12-24 23:16:13] <+Caedes55> grudge, raid captain, adre, reflux, hit master
[2022-12-24 23:16:18] <%+FireZky> i actual play aswell piano reflux
[2022-12-24 23:16:19] <NorGara> prokel as reflux sorc is fun :D
[2022-12-24 23:16:20] <%polig> i think back attack/front attack classes except gunlance are simply harder than hitmaster of the bat
[2022-12-24 23:16:35] <%+FireZky> i just don't have hit master i took precise dagger back to days
[2022-12-24 23:16:35] <%+alex__gfy> as a Deadeye, i envy gunslingers....because Hit Master

[2022-12-24 23:17:38] <%+alex__gfy> baker you should try a deadeye
[2022-12-24 23:17:40] <+Caedes55> i use sleep bombs on every 1 shot mech

[2022-12-24 23:17:58] <NorGara> yeah sleeps and timestops are your friends for sure :D
[2022-12-24 23:18:06] <%polig> btw gunslinger/deadeyes reroute the x z to mouse wheel, it will change your life
