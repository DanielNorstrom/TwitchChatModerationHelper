[2023-01-10 08:25:31] <lum0x33> at least
[2023-01-10 08:25:39] <lum0x33> I think gas is 1/4 the price of eu gas
[2023-01-10 08:25:48] <@%$DerSpiegel_> It's still pretty expensive. Especially in California
[2023-01-10 08:25:49] <%SAXEL34> 4.9L/100km Thats 0.49/mil. Thats good for a pretty big car. My car is 0.89/mil and is way smaller. But I have All Wheel Drive
[2023-01-10 08:25:56] <lum0x33> it used to be way less literally like 1/8th the price of eu gas
[2023-01-10 08:26:00] <%celeran1> so early kandy Bedge
[2023-01-10 08:26:04] <Milad_96> in America they call gas something that is liquid (petrol) LUL

[2023-01-10 08:26:35] <lum0x33> it's funny all americans talking about expensive gas when they still pay like 1/4 of what we pay when gas was cheap here
[2023-01-10 08:27:03] <dcastan6> do you have baby showers in Sweden? if so what kinda of games do y'all play?

[2023-01-10 08:32:21] <%SAXEL34> This messege is VERY IMPORTANT!!!! If it goes so far that a deal is about to happen. And your bargain doesn't go as planned. Dont be afraid to ask the dealership to throw in a few "Services" on the car instead of a lower price. (Services som i att dom servar bilen vid vissa miltal. Det g√•r dom ofta med p√• ist√§llet f√∂r ett l√§gre pris. Och ni f√•r bilen fixad som g√∂r att den lever l√§ngre ist√§llet.) (Sorry for long chat)

I do wish people was nice all the time but they are sales men or women. So if they can earn more they will try. And sound kinda scamisch. But yeah. Everyone wanna earn as much as possible.

[2023-01-10 13:44:17] <+retaker1337> Bidragstagare = welfare
[2023-01-10 13:44:20] <SmokiDyno> yes
[2023-01-10 13:44:22] <SmokiDyno> social assitance
[2023-01-10 13:44:25] <SmokiDyno> assistance
[2023-01-10 13:44:33] <%Svinto85> SmokiDyno well without welfare crime would skyrocket
[2023-01-10 13:44:34] <+nbsdrowe209> yes we all pay for that shit
[2023-01-10 13:44:39] <SmokiDyno> So in my eyes
[2023-01-10 13:44:45] <SmokiDyno> she is scum
[2023-01-10 13:44:47] <%Svinto85> its not a fix but its cheaper then jail
[2023-01-10 13:44:54] <%BlueT1tan> if he got her out of welfare then she should have had an income.... explain that

[2023-01-10 13:45:46] <noheckyou> hello chat
[2023-01-10 13:45:46] <cozybubbletea> i believe the matter of relationship is to maintain it but maybe she can't take it anymore
[2023-01-10 13:46:06] <%BlueT1tan> she's a gold digger now? but not before?
[2023-01-10 13:46:07] <SmokiDyno> Pokimane is a good example
[2023-01-10 13:46:08] <LightupDarkness> Oprah?
[2023-01-10 13:46:11] <SmokiDyno> she would never go in a relationship
