[2023-01-05 20:12:13] <!%jewlyuh> but works for each injury
[2023-01-05 20:12:29] <!%awesometrax> @sleepinghazard they're buffing it actually, after the update it will give the person you pick up haste for 10 seconds

[2023-01-05 20:17:36] <!%awesometrax> I know. But if they rework Twins, decreasing the wakeup time might be good enough to make them viable
