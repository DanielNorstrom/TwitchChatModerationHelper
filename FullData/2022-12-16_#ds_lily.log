[2022-12-16 22:00:18] <%Useless_Eater> no im spartacus
[2022-12-16 22:00:21] <Toxicblob> and that was on like day 2
[2022-12-16 22:00:29] <%Mom_Online> there's a note in one of the recent patch notes about lab trials being bugged
[2022-12-16 22:00:36] <tiringking> Dec 15, 2022 1:34 AM (GMT) - We're aware of an issue where Labyrinth Trials are not spawning naturally in maps. This should be fixed in the next restart patch.
[2022-12-16 22:00:38] <+rfsat> Why  would they keep the atlas passive on the tree if they intentionally made them not spawn?
[2022-12-16 22:00:38] <@%^Nightbot> cuz it's better

[2022-12-16 22:02:29] <@%Kuglorf> the only reason I don't like it is because right now it doesnt have full keyboard support for all the menus
[2022-12-16 22:02:35] <%Konamikoden> when we had 240 pixels but you didn't notice them because the screen was so blurry
[2022-12-16 22:02:35] <@%^Nightbot> i dunno
[2022-12-16 22:02:36] <%Theraxisz> I have no interest in the game, but every interview with the creators makes them seem like the best dudes so I kind of want to buy it anyway LUL
[2022-12-16 22:02:38] <PAPA_ANTONZ> Except you couldnt look at dwarf fortress was a command line game

[2022-12-16 22:04:35] <@%Kuglorf> you cant just change it cuz its all reorganized
[2022-12-16 22:04:40] <Ayrleand> In some cases things arent hotkeyed at all, you have to use the new menus
[2022-12-16 22:04:42] <@%Kuglorf> some menus dont exist some are new

[2022-12-16 23:51:12] <@%^Nightbot> very carefully
[2022-12-16 23:51:23] <@%premadeLOL> oh they got rid of triple portals
[2022-12-16 23:51:33] <@%premadeLOL> so it's worse i guess alkXD
[2022-12-16 23:51:35] <%Nite01> yeah I read that
[2022-12-16 23:51:36] <%Mom_Online> @Nite01 they do I was at the edge of the map and got blocked off by a metal gate with no lever so the only way was to run all the way around and I had no healing
[2022-12-16 23:51:38] <%Nite01> its even worse
[2022-12-16 23:51:52] <+squidbonk> Why your frenzy charges so massive
[2022-12-16 23:51:52] <@%^Nightbot> cuz it's better
[2022-12-16 23:52:04] <%Nite01> @Mom_Online no I meant where the circle closes
[2022-12-16 23:52:15] <%Mom_Online> they do
[2022-12-16 23:52:16] <%Nite01> @Mom_Online like if you are the last one in the map
[2022-12-16 23:52:23] <%Nite01> oh thats good
[2022-12-16 23:52:23] <@%Kuglorf> old charge visuals were much larger
[2022-12-16 23:52:24] <%LordTekkless> old charges were so big
[2022-12-16 23:52:26] <tsaad12> beef skin pls
[2022-12-16 23:52:27] <%Mom_Online> they've always spawn portals where the circle closes wdym
[2022-12-16 23:52:33] <%Nite01> not really
[2022-12-16 23:52:51] <%Nite01> in the end you could just die because no portals where the circle closes
[2022-12-16 23:53:03] <+Parkodin> that neckles looks heavy
[2022-12-16 23:53:16] <%Nite01> yeah
