[2023-01-10 17:51:36] <%+resourcefulperlo> I think when you get hooked you should being able to use spells so you should need to know cooldowns and all
[2023-01-10 17:51:49] <anung> I watched it and I have no problems against DF, but then they switch to Orisa :(
[2023-01-10 17:52:19] <%+resourcefulperlo> yeah but they want to nerf hook not vape

He comes equipped with a very powerful height adjusting lever that’s perfect for our favorite streamer. LHChair doesn’t interact much so it’s really helps when chat can make their own content

[2023-01-10 23:28:09] <GIRLinMaleBody> if he did 300 some tanks like JQ will have only 125 hp after the pin lol

[2023-01-10 23:52:03] <%Magicturtle12> PvE*
[2023-01-10 23:52:31] <xPokesterx> making money
[2023-01-10 23:52:37] <r1ptidestv> fortify is a dumbass cooldown and should get removed, press one button and get 40% damage resist and +200hp
[2023-01-10 23:52:48] <JaminHere> Fixing the game? Whats that? Buy our skins! (I am not a blizzard employee)
[2023-01-10 23:53:11] <anung> hello, how the ctf games were??
[2023-01-10 23:53:35] <CammyyRD> Are you going to play in the OW WC?
[2023-01-10 23:53:37] <JaminHere> Saddest part is as long as there are people buying skins, they are winning. They dont have to give us fast patches.
[2023-01-10 23:53:41] <%xitah99> You will do U2GM C2F?

[2023-01-10 23:54:28] <KnocksFPS> When it comes to balance would you rather nerf the strongest stuff or bring all the underpowered stuff up to speed
[2023-01-10 23:54:29] <CammyyRD> You are tank god
[2023-01-10 23:54:48] <CallMiCas> Zen going to get mythic skin and get megabuffed next season trust🙏
[2023-01-10 23:54:55] <CammyyRD> TRUEEE
[2023-01-10 23:54:55] <r1ptidestv> I don't think they understand that having good balance and making tons of money isn't mutually exclusive
[2023-01-10 23:55:11] <%white_tygga> wait, I played with oversnatch, wtf???? what rank is they???

[2023-01-10 23:58:05] <r1ptidestv> they have geoff goodman's protege as the balance lead. we are doomed
