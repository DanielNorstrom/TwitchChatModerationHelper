[2023-01-04 21:52:40] <%bobinsson> what's so hype about dead space?
[2023-01-04 21:52:52] <%Michelleki0> Dead Space was the alien zombie dismemberment one, right
[2023-01-04 21:52:58] <%NaguNak> it's just a really good action horror game
[2023-01-04 21:53:04] <%bobinsson> fair enough
[2023-01-04 21:53:22] <%ynlokk> Deadspace has a unique gameplay mechanic, so it is interesting
[2023-01-04 21:53:23] <%NaguNak> people wanna see it with new and updated PS5 ready graphics
