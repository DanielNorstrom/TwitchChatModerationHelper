[2022-12-10 01:14:39] <%doom_666_guy> There are some steps for DLC
[2022-12-10 01:14:43] <%+stuntman_five> That depends on what you would like
[2022-12-10 01:14:49] <Gennousake_> You'll have kill the hydra

[2022-12-10 01:16:05] <%+stuntman_five> If you want to play this completely, the DLC will probably add a day or two more. If you would just like to finish it, ignore the DLC.
