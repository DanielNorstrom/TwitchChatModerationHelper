[2022-12-12 00:05:47] <%reivehnfliyt> we ain't poisoning anyone, but many medieval poisonings were quite simple
[2022-12-12 00:06:01] <%$LederIappen> I use Magnesium so I don’t get Cramps during training
[2022-12-12 00:06:18] <PandaHerovt> oh noodle
[2022-12-12 00:06:25] <PandaHerovt> is this sound scratchies?
[2022-12-12 00:06:29] <+ToastyBunzUwU> magnisium only helps if you have magnesium deficiency that what i was told
[2022-12-12 00:06:31] <%$LederIappen> Only when needed tho, if I notice I don’t get cramps for a while I stop taking it
[2022-12-12 00:06:32] <%the_cheesegod420> you're technically poisoning yourself if you drink something with alcohol and stuff like that
[2022-12-12 00:06:35] <%reivehnfliyt> Also, I shudder the number of diplomatic incidents were caused by some noble dying from presumed poisoning, only they weren't intentionally, it was just peanut allergy or somehting
[2022-12-12 00:06:39] <PandaHerovt> aaah ty ty
[2022-12-12 00:07:14] <%$LederIappen> And then I will start taking it again when I start cramping up alot

[2022-12-12 00:08:24] <%reivehnfliyt> @the_cheesegod420 Alcohol in small quanities is actually healthy though, its a great sanitizer orally and helps balance things out digestively, elephants and monkeys in south africa and botswana eat partially fermented fruit and get drunk
[2022-12-12 00:09:01] <%reivehnfliyt> A tiny bit of alcohol in water also sterilizes it for safety, which is why ale was so popular in the middle ages
[2022-12-12 00:09:09] <%$LederIappen> I, to my luck, habe barely any allergies, to be exact only one that really affects me and I notice but it’s nearly the most anoying allergy to have

[2022-12-12 00:21:03] <%reivehnfliyt> Nicholas II of russia was worried for his life and his family when the russian revolution sprang up and the civil war broke out, He begged to be sheltered in britain with his family but the british government rejected his pleas as they felt the public in britain would be angry over making britain even more of a target for attacks by germany. the Tsar and his family would not survive, Belived to have been secretly executed and thrown into a mineshaft in the ural mountains.

[2022-12-12 00:30:54] <%reivehnfliyt> you know, there aren't many well done inclusive anthems in the world, But there is one song many australians call one of our unofficial anthems, and that's "I am Australian" by a band called the Seekers, If you want a song that's inclusive of peoples foreign, naturalised and indigenous, from all walks of life, there are seldom that do as well as that song in my opinion

[2022-12-12 00:32:24] <%reivehnfliyt> W came from an earlier interaction of german and latin that went through a dialect shifty
[2022-12-12 00:32:29] <%+OneWholesomeDev> Upper front teeth on bottom lip

[2022-12-12 00:32:58] <MysticJanus> It's hard trying to explain sounds that don't exist in other languages.
[2022-12-12 00:33:05] <agonix010> Polish has a similar w sound
[2022-12-12 00:33:09] <MysticJanus> Like trying to explain what a retroflexive r is
[2022-12-12 00:33:15] <%reivehnfliyt> famously, W is double V which is U in latin as U got split from V and V was originally pronounced as U
[2022-12-12 00:33:25] VIEWERS: 406
[2022-12-12 00:33:26] <%reivehnfliyt> which is why double U is two V

[2022-12-12 00:33:55] <papa_theodor> swedish's w is non-existent
[2022-12-12 00:34:05] <%reivehnfliyt> W is a dumb letter and i am all for the return of the letter Wynn Ƿ ƿ
