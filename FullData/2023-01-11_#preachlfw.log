[2023-01-11 11:02:11] <%+Awerlu> @JaeusA I think if WoW stopped trying to have a big main story with big bads and just had their zone side quest storylines with associated dungeons/raids I'd have been happier.
[2023-01-11 11:02:13] <%asukarae12> Is this the iconic WoW music
[2023-01-11 11:02:28] <%Tyki_jp> Hello Mike and chat

[2023-01-11 11:56:28] <%KelticNight> I'd craft but I can't be arsed levelling blacksmithing LUL
[2023-01-11 11:56:45] <!Fyrbo> And depending on what itlvl you got m+ gear from, you can have loads of 415 gear

[2023-01-11 11:56:50] <+NicklasJ92> it is awful to level but it is very nice for hedging bad RNG
[2023-01-11 11:56:50] <%$Azikielboi> @Preachlfw KEKW some people hate that they have to talk to people
[2023-01-11 11:56:55] <%+Geri_0123> just be lucky and have inspiration proc on the first try
[2023-01-11 11:57:00] <Rayv123> I had one interaction that felt like a turkish bazar, it was great
[2023-01-11 11:57:03] <%Agro1969> reforging is terrible - I was ending the same item back with more mats for three hours
[2023-01-11 11:57:03] <%$sim967> it's complicated, but I'm gaining knowledge
[2023-01-11 11:57:06] <Jarlan23> i grinding my blacksmith hard so i could craft every weapon at 418 but im alliance on a horde server
[2023-01-11 11:57:12] <+Tyd4r> It needs a lot of improvement, the fact that you cant guarantee stuff and have to trust the crafter when they say they have x skill is bad
[2023-01-11 11:57:18] <Jarlan23> so not many people want it yet
[2023-01-11 11:57:26] <@%Enoz___> my problem with it is, how to effectively find a crafter on your server(group of servers) who can craft what you need. like, trade chat is not efficient.
[2023-01-11 11:57:33] <bugz_munny> The order system needs some work
[2023-01-11 11:57:45] <bugz_munny> Like the ability to take orders after logout would be crisp
[2023-01-11 11:57:47] <%majkos> crafting is ok but its a huge gold sink
[2023-01-11 11:57:48] <%$Azikielboi> @Enoz___ they addressed that ina  post the other day, they are working on it, but yeah

[2023-01-11 11:58:05] <@%Enoz___> @Enoz___ yeah I know. we need like a bulletin board or something.
[2023-01-11 11:58:06] <%+Geri_0123> The thing is that public orders are just useless aside from treatise stuff
[2023-01-11 11:58:14] <%Tyki_jp> @Enoz___ Have trade chat ever been helpful? let's be real KEKW
[2023-01-11 11:58:15] <+coffebreak> what classes can use crafted stuff? Seems for my hunter the bow i.e is worse then regular normal raid-drop bow... 2 sparks and still not really amazing?
[2023-01-11 11:58:15] <FelicitySmoak> what was that light elemental NPC?
[2023-01-11 11:58:20] <%KelticNight> Blizzard put a blue post up saying the crafting system was a good base but not where they want it to be - they said the public order system could be better

[2023-01-11 12:04:43] <+NicklasJ92> it is just an excuse to market Gladiator once again

[2023-01-11 12:05:23] <Markreivi> I want a Gladiator movie about that guy that pees himself and gets a mace to the face in the first bout.
[2023-01-11 12:05:25] <%+Kammalla> I wish I could forget it. The sequel to Prometheus is even worse.

[2023-01-11 12:09:03] <BlackOdd> he goes all in

[2023-01-11 12:09:05] <iChickenGod> he was in one of the best movies. it's called MORBUIS
[2023-01-11 12:09:06] <ainu83> probably both him and the terrible script
[2023-01-11 12:09:10] <%+DzikiWegorz1223> I mean the joker was written by someone else

[2023-01-11 12:09:34] <+Khellendross> confusing isn't how I would describe Dune. Its very...dense. The world is pretty damn detailed, thought the first movie felt very front loaded, I suspect the next two will be alot more cohesive
[2023-01-11 12:09:36] <Gaphill> Leto is awful at picking roles
[2023-01-11 12:09:37] <metaphased> a lot of the stuff he shot in that film wasnt in the final movie

[2023-01-11 12:10:37] <Markreivi> Tennant shifted marvelously into voice acting
[2023-01-11 12:10:40] <%+Hunter_GS> Matt was absolutly fucking around in Morbius, he knew that was a trashfire :D
[2023-01-11 12:10:42] <%+Spira> David Tenant is back as well LUL

[2023-01-11 12:10:55] <+tyrew0rm> Matt smith was also fantastic in The Crown as well
[2023-01-11 12:10:57] <%$TulkasStream> Thing is, everyone has their Doctor without shitting on other peoples. Which is unheard of mostly.
[2023-01-11 12:11:00] <Kanyusi> isnt dr who a lady now?

[2023-01-11 12:12:02] <PinkTaricFTW> His audition for The Doctor was reportedly the shortest they ever had. He walked in said "Hello, I am the Doctor" and the casting director said "...yeah, you are..."
[2023-01-11 12:12:04] <+NiteyRvD> I'm shocked.... WWE sold to Saudi Arabian Gouvernment? WTF?

[2023-01-11 12:12:58] <Gaphill> tbf starfield looks like garbo, mystical artifact collector in a reskinned FO4

[2023-01-11 12:13:10] <%chavelo_> Nope, cant trust them anymore, its gonna be shit
[2023-01-11 12:13:12] <%USAFace666> good FO4 was fucking garbage
[2023-01-11 12:13:12] <+nyrrro> F4 is good, just not as good as new vegas
[2023-01-11 12:13:12] <Markreivi> Fallout 4 was a warning
[2023-01-11 12:13:13] <%+EndCrawler> he doesn't know KEKL
[2023-01-11 12:13:14] <%Allessii> fallout 4 is good game
[2023-01-11 12:13:14] <%$TrowGundam> I coudln't finish Skyrim, I'm not interested in Skyrim in Space

[2023-01-11 12:13:16] <creamos1> here i am waiting for baldurs gate 3
[2023-01-11 12:13:17] <Osskssa> Fallout 4 is good, with tons of community mods lol
[2023-01-11 12:13:18] <Khalus90> decent game poor rpg
[2023-01-11 12:13:18] <%+bobbytise> 4 was decent, don't listen to hates
[2023-01-11 12:13:18] <+rainbowcat89> The gameplay looked terrible, 3 fps :< But i hope its good
[2023-01-11 12:13:19] <+elixirfield1> whats going on with fallout 76 anyway
[2023-01-11 12:13:20] <%+Dimortii> the trailer was already running on so low fps
[2023-01-11 12:13:21] <virtualsoulss> it'll come out eventually
[2023-01-11 12:13:22] <%TheRealJinjix> I enjoyed 4
[2023-01-11 12:13:22] <+Kazhe> Looking forward to visit 900 empty planets before finding one interesting one
[2023-01-11 12:13:24] <%Brayburn32> Fallout 4 was no New Vegas
[2023-01-11 12:13:24] <3rayed> Did you play the outer worlds?
[2023-01-11 12:13:24] <%+Karshu_Games> didnt play fallout 4, has the main theme playing...
[2023-01-11 12:13:24] <%+Vitriol17> fallout 76?
[2023-01-11 12:13:26] <+project_exia> i enjoy fallout 4 but haven't played without completely overhauling it with mods for a few years
[2023-01-11 12:13:26] <Kanyusi> They just keep dumbing down their games Sadge
[2023-01-11 12:13:27] <%+nisk___> 3 and NV are best
[2023-01-11 12:13:27] <%Zabraxa> Meh. Starfields gonna be the same old halfarsed Bethesda slodge. But the modding community will make it worthwhile.
[2023-01-11 12:13:28] <+NicoNiSenpai> fallout 4 is good, 76 isnt
[2023-01-11 12:13:29] <holoholobird> can't look at bethesda the same after fallout 76
[2023-01-11 12:13:30] <%+Azalis1701> I liked Fallout 4 for what most hated about it, a linear story
[2023-01-11 12:13:32] <Furtbute> shit did i miss the ffxiv msq
[2023-01-11 12:13:34] <%DaftiDuck_> new vegas is a top 10 game of all time
[2023-01-11 12:13:34] <%$Azikielboi> i miss those streams Sadge
[2023-01-11 12:13:35] <+sirf4ce> Fallout 76 was a clusterfuck-a-thon
[2023-01-11 12:13:35] <%$Azikielboi> they were so good
[2023-01-11 12:13:36] <virtualsoulss> i played outer worlds
[2023-01-11 12:13:38] <+Khellendross> I'm excited for Elder Scrolls 6's eventual debut for the PS6 Pro
[2023-01-11 12:13:38] <%+InquisitorLockhart> I like 4 but it's a big step down from NV
[2023-01-11 12:13:40] <%USAFace666> @nisk___ 1 2 and NV are best
[2023-01-11 12:13:41] <+bluedyedrose> 4 is fine, nothing home to write home about
[2023-01-11 12:13:42] <Osskssa> DONV best one
[2023-01-11 12:13:43] <%+EndCrawler> COPIUM
[2023-01-11 12:13:44] <%+notlob> yeah new vegas wasn't bethesda :D
[2023-01-11 12:13:47] <%Vinestra28> COPIUM Last one
[2023-01-11 12:13:50] <Markreivi> To this day I've not finished the F4 story.
[2023-01-11 12:13:50] <%Nanonaps> bethesda games are always jank but still fun af. (Maybe not 76)
[2023-01-11 12:13:50] <honno0451> NV is peak.
[2023-01-11 12:13:51] <Gaphill> @Kazhe dont forget your important mission of gathering the mystical artifacts LUL
[2023-01-11 12:13:51] <FelicitySmoak> outer worlds is kindaaaaaa like fallout
[2023-01-11 12:13:51] <JaeusA> COPIUM The last one
[2023-01-11 12:13:52] <@%+ChunkeyNinja> but one thing FO4 did was improve the gun play so i think thats a good sign for starfield
[2023-01-11 12:13:56] <%Vinestra28> ff8 is just after this stream
[2023-01-11 12:13:56] <+Horfent> I still play Skyrim unmodded once in an while
[2023-01-11 12:14:00] <iValenhart> Yes.
[2023-01-11 12:14:00] <%+Everwaltz> MSQ after this COPIUM
[2023-01-11 12:14:03] <VidulaSaix> 4 is just a video game that you play
[2023-01-11 12:14:07] <%USAFace666> 4 isn't fine. it's writing is shit. it completely misses the fucking point of fallout
[2023-01-11 12:14:07] <%+bobbytise> He does it a lot
[2023-01-11 12:14:07] <+nyrrro> like every time you go back to him lmao
[2023-01-11 12:14:08] <%DaftiDuck_> its just not a fallout game really
[2023-01-11 12:14:09] <+NicklasJ92> every 2 minutes
[2023-01-11 12:14:10] <%Allessii> about every 4 hours

[2023-01-11 12:14:14] <+NicklasJ92> that fucker needs to piss off
[2023-01-11 12:14:15] <JaeusA> oh Preston Garvey, yeah he says that a lot
[2023-01-11 12:14:16] <3rayed> Msq COPIUM
[2023-01-11 12:14:18] <Kanyusi> 4 is just a pretty good looter shooter thing with rpg elements
[2023-01-11 12:14:19] <%+Geri_0123> FO4 gameplay was good, RPG/story part was bland
[2023-01-11 12:14:20] <%+MrZxorm> My hope for starfield is a decent crafting system for ships. Been playing Empyrion for a year now and love the ship building in that
[2023-01-11 12:14:20] <+kiahoga> i have faith that whatever starfields poblems are the modding community will fix
[2023-01-11 12:14:25] <Siege28> fallout 4 msq is like 2 hours long
[2023-01-11 12:14:26] <redraybae> Fallout 4 is not an rpg
[2023-01-11 12:14:29] <%silk_miraj> FO4 is the most meh fallout game. Not good, not bad, just meh.
[2023-01-11 12:14:40] <%+Spira> I feel left out as I started with 4 and didnt understand how the mech worked LUL
[2023-01-11 12:14:48] <Markreivi> Bethesda Fallouts look like they were just nuked instead of being set 200 years after. But with a new IP they might do some nice work.
[2023-01-11 12:14:48] <%Jairbreaux> you can spell reflect heavy tome
[2023-01-11 12:14:51] <+DelamTTL> shards hits for 400k on 15
[2023-01-11 12:14:55] <+DelamTTL> on non-tank
[2023-01-11 12:14:55] <@%Methuzahla> I really liked Far Harbour though and Nuka World
[2023-01-11 12:15:02] <Furtbute> I only remember hating the settlement mechanic from Fallout. Seriously Preston, pls stop.
[2023-01-11 12:15:04] <+project_exia> honestly if fallout 4 had the same levelling and perk system as new vegas / 3 it would be great imo
[2023-01-11 12:15:06] <lenz_401> after what they did with F76 I lost my trust with Bethesda
[2023-01-11 12:15:20] <+Khellendross> somehow Bethesda manages to take 8 years to make a major title and STILL have crunch. Its pretty amazing
[2023-01-11 12:15:30] <%+Spira> Did they fix the last boss here?
[2023-01-11 12:15:33] <%+Hunter_GS> as i see it Starfield either going to be the greatest sci-fi RPG anyone has ever saw, or a tremendus waste of time and resources that could have been given to Elder Scrolls VI
[2023-01-11 12:15:41] <Gaphill> @project_exia and maybe actual writers doing their job and choices to go along with it
[2023-01-11 12:15:42] <Kanyusi> Remember the Elder scrolls VI announcement from 5 years ago OMEGALUL
[2023-01-11 12:15:43] <yeetmymeet> such a rotund character model
[2023-01-11 12:15:46] <redraybae> after New Vegas F4 felt like an insane downgrade
[2023-01-11 12:15:51] <%chavelo_> I dont like the combat of Bethesda games like fallout/TES. So those games are usually a flop for me
[2023-01-11 12:15:52] <%+Hunter_GS> if its anything other then the absolute best, then it's gonna be a sad, sad release
[2023-01-11 12:15:57] <%USAFace666> @project_exia with that writing? nah. it would've been better sure but great is a stretch. it completely fucks the BoS and alot of other important things
[2023-01-11 12:16:01] <%+kampfh951> @Khellendross It's because they have like 3 VAs that has to voice the entire game
[2023-01-11 12:16:10] VIEWERS: 2¬†556
[2023-01-11 12:16:19] <+elixirfield1> wish they would remove these mobs hate em
[2023-01-11 12:16:22] <+Khellendross> @Kanyusi I wasn't really joking when I said it would be for the PS6 LUL
[2023-01-11 12:16:26] <%+jhazor> @lenz_401 the thing is as a basic on paper concept - Survival/crafter/builder in Fallout universe -Sign me up why has noone thought of this already? - and then the actual game was rushed garbage
[2023-01-11 12:16:26] <@%Methuzahla> I really want a new Elder Scrolls. Skyrim remains my fave game... but I dont know if I trust Bethesda with it after some of their choices :(
[2023-01-11 12:16:45] <+project_exia> @Gaphill I basically never do the story, did it once per faction and ignore it for any further runs. i enjoy building settlements and just exploring honestly
[2023-01-11 12:16:51] <%Vinestra28> @Methuzahla Sadge Imagine if they make the game illegal to mod..
[2023-01-11 12:16:56] <%+YuushaEX> diminishing returns
[2023-01-11 12:17:00] <Furtbute> I think I spent more time messing with mods on new vegas than playing it
[2023-01-11 12:17:04] <%$Azikielboi> @Methuzahla they have gotten way too ambitious
[2023-01-11 12:17:14] <%Vinestra28> @Gaphill modCheck people dont just mod Bethesdas games?
[2023-01-11 12:17:25] <%+YuushaEX> said the forbidden word
[2023-01-11 12:17:25] <@%Methuzahla> oh god not allowing modding would be the worst thing they could do
[2023-01-11 12:17:35] <BlackOdd> @Methuzahla bete
[2023-01-11 12:17:37] <BlackOdd> b
[2023-01-11 12:17:38] <%$Azikielboi> @Methuzahla i have 0 fear of that
[2023-01-11 12:17:39] [Notification] Zalinio subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 13 months, currently on a 13 month streak!
[2023-01-11 12:17:42] <%Vinestra28> @Methuzahla They did try to do the whole only the creative thing..
[2023-01-11 12:17:44] <%+jhazor> @Methuzahla i'm hoping being MS owned had given them the resources to do things properly now
[2023-01-11 12:17:44] <Kanyusi> Unmoddable elder scrolls?! WutFace
[2023-01-11 12:17:47] <%$Azikielboi> they would never do that
[2023-01-11 12:17:51] <Markreivi> Oh they'll propably make it forced online and discourage modding. Bring back Creation Club for one more hurrah.
[2023-01-11 12:17:55] <@%Methuzahla> Theres a total redo of Skyrim called Enderal, Its fucking amazing
[2023-01-11 12:18:00] <%$Azikielboi> @Vinestra28 that was super different that was curating mods

[2023-01-11 12:18:25] <Furtbute> Is Bethesda still on Gamebryo?
[2023-01-11 12:18:26] <+Saryuken> Bethesda and Blizzard are competing on who will piss more people off
[2023-01-11 12:18:28] <%+protean_wave> Bethesda's engine is good at what it does. It's their animations that are crap
[2023-01-11 12:18:30] <%+Geri_0123> why would you pay for mods when there is nexusmods
[2023-01-11 12:18:31] <+ClaireRunja> Bethesda will always have modding. Dont have to worry about that
[2023-01-11 12:18:34] <%+Spira> Someone in my year at uni did a mod for tf2 for their dissertation
[2023-01-11 12:18:35] <@%Methuzahla> They were like no mods Madge  and Nexus was just "hold my beer"
[2023-01-11 12:18:37] <%$Azikielboi> they ALLOWED you to charge for mods they didnt force mods to cost money
[2023-01-11 12:18:39] <%+Azalis1701> No mods in Bethesda at this point would be like turning off addons in WoW
[2023-01-11 12:18:41] <%$Azikielboi> those are very diferent things
[2023-01-11 12:18:52] <%+Spira> I was actually jealous
[2023-01-11 12:18:55] <%chavelo_> @protean_wave you mean the absolute buggy mess of an Engine ?  LOL
[2023-01-11 12:18:55] <%$Azikielboi> they allowed steamworkshop mods to charge money
[2023-01-11 12:18:58] <+elixirfield1> bethesda are just a bunch of marketing gimmics now it just works
[2023-01-11 12:18:59] <%+jhazor> @Furtbute heavily modifed and updated but basically yes though they call it somethign else now
[2023-01-11 12:19:05] <Phobion> @preachlfw will you play with Starfield when it comes out?
[2023-01-11 12:19:15] <@%Methuzahla> if you havent played Enderal though, you legit should
[2023-01-11 12:19:18] <@%Methuzahla> its fantastic
[2023-01-11 12:19:20] <+kiahoga> i think Wizards of the coast told them hold my beer
[2023-01-11 12:19:21] <%+Hunter_GS> look they can try to make the game unmodable but like...even fking spiderman has 100s of mods, without developer help. who cares? people gonna mod it enyway
[2023-01-11 12:19:29] <%+Geri_0123> Enderal imho is better than skyrim
[2023-01-11 12:19:32] <%$Azikielboi> i can see how they could honestly think that would be good for the modding scene (allowing modders to charge)
[2023-01-11 12:19:34] <%+protean_wave> their engine handles thousands of objects that can be picked up and have physics. No other game even really tries to do this
[2023-01-11 12:19:36] <@%Methuzahla> Beyond Skyrim is a huge project too. Think Bruma and something else is out atm
[2023-01-11 12:19:47] <hiteki> Tbh the paying for mods thing wasnt a bad idea since mods take a lot of time and effort to make, the problem was that bethasda got a cut on something they didnt make
[2023-01-11 12:19:51] <+ClaireRunja> I cant wait for StarField mods, just imagine the planets people will make KEKW

[2023-01-11 12:20:56] <%+jhazor> big nopers for me though at least one of the issues is on the devs
[2023-01-11 12:20:57] <+Archiduss> I like how you can make transgender characters in the game. It‚Äôs a bit of a fu to Rowling.
[2023-01-11 12:20:59] <@%Methuzahla> shes a fuckin psycho
[2023-01-11 12:20:59] <%+notlob> terf queen jk

[2023-01-11 12:21:02] <%thenaaru> Gonna buy it second hand so I dont give her money
[2023-01-11 12:21:04] <thevizelvius> She gets royalties
[2023-01-11 12:21:08] <+DelamTTL> she gets a royalty im guessing off sales yeah
[2023-01-11 12:21:10] <+zxabu230> she already get her payout apparently
[2023-01-11 12:21:11] <%+ausYenLoWang> seh def gets some form of royalties sadly
[2023-01-11 12:21:12] <lenz_401> I refuse to give money to J.K.R
[2023-01-11 12:21:13] <%beskarsilver> It's royalties

[2023-01-11 12:21:15] <yulbaruart> K.K a wizard Harry
[2023-01-11 12:21:15] <+project_exia> she gets royalties i believe
[2023-01-11 12:21:15] <%+Spira> I think she still gets a ton of money
[2023-01-11 12:21:15] <Vasciras> just pirate it lmao
[2023-01-11 12:21:20] <lilipat27> Madge cancel and boycott andies
[2023-01-11 12:21:22] <%RamRots> What did she say this time ?
[2023-01-11 12:21:23] <%Legndarysora> @Preachlfw watch it be terrible and its gonna be Potter fans that bring reckoning ot the gaming industry like how taylor swift fans are to ticketmaster
[2023-01-11 12:21:26] <Drakstar94> like she need money lol
[2023-01-11 12:21:27] <%+Hunter_GS> gonna get some royalty out of it but like it doesnt fking matter at this point. itll be a drop in the bucket
[2023-01-11 12:21:28] <weedyz> @Hunter_GS paying for a hp game means giving money to her, which means agreeing with her basically
[2023-01-11 12:21:29] <%+MrBorisPavlov> @YuushaEX "nutty" is putting it lightly
[2023-01-11 12:21:31] <iChickenGod> time to go to the sees of the bay then
[2023-01-11 12:21:35] <+rainbowcat89> I dont care about her, the devs have made a good game i think
[2023-01-11 12:21:37] <hiteki> @Xann7 i mean yes but the thing is you could just give the modders money directly without bethesda and thats works just fine
[2023-01-11 12:21:38] <%+raynackermann> If I based what I bought off whether the person/company behind it is crap then I'd have nothing
[2023-01-11 12:21:41] <+khMagnus2010> even a lot of the main cast from the movies try not to associate with her much now from what i hear
[2023-01-11 12:21:41] <+Archiduss> Rowling has a % of all potter sales.
[2023-01-11 12:21:42] <%Txn_Nerothos> not buying the game will only  not pay the devs; she won't have her live change because of that one game KEKW
[2023-01-11 12:21:42] <%chavelo_> A lot of streamers are boycotting it because they dont want shit in their chat @Preachlfw
[2023-01-11 12:21:49] <%Succath> Morning @Preachlfw Hope you are doing well.
[2023-01-11 12:21:50] <%Jairbreaux> to the high sees mateys
[2023-01-11 12:21:53] <%ravenribb> @Preachlfw wait, interrupt WA now assigns target AND spell to kick ? nutty
[2023-01-11 12:21:56] <%Jairbreaux> seas
[2023-01-11 12:21:57] <+noxheart> i mean who gives a fuck about her. Her shit opinions are not gonna change anything so it shouldn't keep people from playing the game
[2023-01-11 12:21:57] <ci11antroo> are blue swivels bad aoes?
[2023-01-11 12:22:01] <%+Spira> I imagine it might be a problem for twitch
[2023-01-11 12:22:02] <yulbaruart> it's her I.P she would have royalties % wise only they know
[2023-01-11 12:22:02] <%SZebra> That's more than fair
[2023-01-11 12:22:03] <%+Hunter_GS> @weedyz no it doesnt mean i agree with her. i absolutly separate my enjoyment of HP with his idiotic rants.
[2023-01-11 12:22:06] <virtualsoulss> more likely the licened it from her publisher and she gets a cut of that
[2023-01-11 12:22:08] <%+Tibbroar> okay, it will absolutely be me.
[2023-01-11 12:22:10] <%Vauche> It would 100% attract the weirdos

[2023-01-11 12:22:18] <%+raynackermann> Yeah JP, Cohh etc have said they're not bothering because of that
[2023-01-11 12:22:19] <%+Sphexator> shit over what ?
[2023-01-11 12:22:20] <+project_exia> havent they given players more spells if they pre-order the deluxe edition?

[2023-01-11 12:22:23] <%+Geri_0123> @ravenribb it's the target that was last interrupted by that person
[2023-01-11 12:22:25] <%+DzikiWegorz1223> @Hunter_GS then fuck it, we agree with her :) that's some backwards logic
[2023-01-11 12:22:25] <%Medias> If I play the game and some random ppl on the internet think I hate trans ppl, so be it
[2023-01-11 12:22:26] <%Nanonaps> I mean sure she is nutty but who cares, if you really consistently cared about not financing nutty people you probably can't play anything
[2023-01-11 12:22:28] <%+BartyBreakerDragon> Yeah, twitch chat is gonna be weird af during that
[2023-01-11 12:22:28] <%urbish_> chat is actually not as bad as i thought on this topic. i like this community
[2023-01-11 12:22:28] <%KelticNight> devs have already been paid for the majority of their work, can't see rank and file getting royalties
[2023-01-11 12:22:29] <+gnorbob> subs only mode? ez
[2023-01-11 12:22:30] <%+knukles0> the thing is Rowling is not that good a writer, it is just that the Harry Potter world was really good
[2023-01-11 12:22:33] <%hammertofall> people getting worked up about one womans opinions is kinda weird ngl
[2023-01-11 12:22:35] <%Muhdoose> Drama tourists
[2023-01-11 12:22:36] <%Succath> Asmon will stream it as he gets off on shit like that
[2023-01-11 12:22:36] <%Allessii> only sub chat ?
[2023-01-11 12:22:40] <%+MrZxorm> Even talking about playing it causes chat to be a tad toxic xD
[2023-01-11 12:22:42] <%Muhdoose> Just like in your Blizzard HQ video
[2023-01-11 12:22:42] <weedyz> @Hunter_GS but that's what allows her to have this big of an audience and the financial means to get her voice out there, so like it or not, in the real word you are participating to it
[2023-01-11 12:22:42] <%RamRots> @Preachlfw  im out of the know ,  what is happening with that game ?
[2023-01-11 12:22:43] <%+Hunter_GS> oh ffs, think what you will
[2023-01-11 12:22:45] <%+kampfh951> It's rough morally. JKR is a [very bad word] and anything that has a chance of earning her money, shouldn't. But the game'll probably be good
[2023-01-11 12:22:46] <%skydoom> and people bashing on which  house choice you made
[2023-01-11 12:22:47] <%ravenribb> Geri_0123 yeah just noticed, it's what you interrupted
[2023-01-11 12:22:48] <Xann7> @hiteki Yeah, the problem was some of the modders got greedy and left nexus leaving the mod outdated
[2023-01-11 12:22:50] <%+EndCrawler> sub only chat ?
[2023-01-11 12:22:52] <%SZebra> Nothing like a good old grudge wank
[2023-01-11 12:22:54] <+khMagnus2010> turn on sub only chat for that?
[2023-01-11 12:22:58] <%$JackTHerbert> i think the people in the community here that wouldn't like it would just be respectable and not watch that day

[2023-01-11 12:23:05] <%chavelo_> @RamRots Nothing with the game itself, its the author thats the problem
[2023-01-11 12:23:07] <%+ausYenLoWang> @Preachlfw if those people used the game as a teaching oppertuinity for inclusion etc etc it could be a bigger tool than using it for hating on those playing it
[2023-01-11 12:23:10] <%+hodiaa> eh, i still give amazon money even though i know they use slave labor
[2023-01-11 12:23:12] <+xanadu_1> Being outraged has become a hobby for very bored people

[2023-01-11 12:23:13] <+iStrategy> Im new to the game. We can only play druid with the natural form on Balance and resto right (with gliphs) the other two needs to be animal form ?
[2023-01-11 12:23:14] <+Meriax> I doubt she even cares about that money tbh so
[2023-01-11 12:23:16] <+tyrew0rm> I'll probably not play the game, but I wont dogpile on anyone who will
[2023-01-11 12:23:17] <+pistachiogurl> i guess once its been bought id rather watch a streamer than buy it myself
[2023-01-11 12:23:17] <%Medias> Let her have her opinion and move on.
[2023-01-11 12:23:18] <PieceofTofu> I feel like those who genuinely care aren't the people who go around flaming folks on twitch
[2023-01-11 12:23:21] <%+Hunter_GS> if you actually think that you not buying a game will help anything then you are delusional
[2023-01-11 12:23:26] <%+jhazor> the plot seems to lean on some stuff that skirts very close to some anti-semetic conspiracies too just to add to controversies.

[2023-01-11 12:24:00] <weedyz> @Hunter_GS not buying it wont change much, buying it will make things worse, pretty easy to understand ;)
[2023-01-11 12:24:01] <%KelticNight> if you played the game, i'd have some charity links in chat. outweigh the bad with some good

[2023-01-11 12:24:43] <%Nanonaps> @weedyz I really need a measure on how "worse" it gets... my bet is it doesn't actually get worse just because you buy a HP game LUL
[2023-01-11 12:24:46] <+Meriax> She's already a billionare she won't be sad if some ppl don't buy the game lol

[2023-01-11 12:25:13] <%+MrZxorm> I've seen people thurst over the water tribe, thats about it. Maybe my twitter time line is cursed?
[2023-01-11 12:25:14] <%SteelfurLive> Watch it in a cinema, and then never watch it again
[2023-01-11 12:25:15] <%Vauche> I won't be talking about it in 10 years, but it was a fun watch
[2023-01-11 12:25:16] <%porridgeu> It‚Äôs the burning of Teldrassil
[2023-01-11 12:25:16] <%Vinestra28> I heard it failed to make it back

[2023-01-11 12:25:26] <+DelamTTL> no theres no need for 3d

[2023-01-11 12:25:29] <+Khellendross> story better than the first one from what I hear, but still not terrific
[2023-01-11 12:25:29] <+Meriax> 3D is supposed to be very good
[2023-01-11 12:25:29] <+thandrur> it's a cinema experience, yes
[2023-01-11 12:25:29] <%Mallas2> just give me Dune.. avatar is yawn
[2023-01-11 12:25:30] <+khMagnus2010> apparently the next movie is gonna involve a fire tribe that will disturb the balance, but the show has nothing to do with ATLA

[2023-01-11 12:25:31] <CodeineCrazey> nah that movie is made for cinemas

[2023-01-11 12:25:38] <%Nanonaps> Avatar 3d eye candy, story less interesting
[2023-01-11 12:25:38] <%Arvediu> 3d is not required but id say cinema is
[2023-01-11 12:25:39] <%Vauche> The 3D was distracting for some, but done pretty well. You could skip it though
[2023-01-11 12:25:42] <virtualsoulss> 3d is a dumb gimmick.
[2023-01-11 12:25:42] <Kreathak> the hype was certainly about the 3d
[2023-01-11 12:25:43] <+Khellendross> you wanna see it in theaters. IMAX if possible
[2023-01-11 12:25:44] <%+Mak2349> saw it in 3D and i wasn't impressed
[2023-01-11 12:25:45] <%+StuffedWuci> I saw the first one in imax 3D and wasnt impressed, so I just haven't bothered with the new one
[2023-01-11 12:25:45] <%+YuushaEX> see it at 3d max
[2023-01-11 12:25:47] <%+Spira> If people dont wanna play it fine, but you cant control or dictate that to others and are an ass if you harass people, if they feel that strongly they will do donations etc
[2023-01-11 12:25:47] <%urbish_> do they even do 3D anymore?
[2023-01-11 12:25:47] <%Txn_Nerothos> the hype of the first was mostly because it was the first huge 3D movie
[2023-01-11 12:25:48] <%Gaotastic> @preachlfw do you plan on watching the Last of Us
[2023-01-11 12:25:48] <%SteelfurLive> yeah its really only good in the cinema
[2023-01-11 12:25:49] <%+BartyBreakerDragon> It's definitely a watch in cinema or don't watch at all
[2023-01-11 12:25:50] <%+Lekebilen> It's like attending a 3 hour art gallery, pretty to look at, but not much more
[2023-01-11 12:25:50] <MrTugge> Yea kinda is made for 3d i would say else it might be less interesting
[2023-01-11 12:25:54] <%KelticNight> it's only fun if someone throws a bucket of water on you every 10 minutes
[2023-01-11 12:25:54] <+Mackemm73> If you didn't like the first one I doubt you'd like the second
[2023-01-11 12:25:55] <+rickos42> It was pretty incredible visuals at IMAX

[2023-01-11 12:31:53] <+Khellendross> weapon weaving is big on quite a few classes. Definitely Revenant is one of those

[2023-01-11 12:31:54] <%$Azikielboi> but yeah weapon swapping

[2023-01-11 12:34:02] <%AngryFil> @Preachlfw i've missed your entire GW2 experience thus far due to power outages, how're you liking the game so far?

[2023-01-11 12:34:05] <%+mobbeh> turret farms
[2023-01-11 12:34:05] <%+Geri_0123> AFK farm is basically autocasting some ability to tag mobs. It's allowed if you are at your PC and respond when a GM asks about what you doing

[2023-01-11 12:34:12] <%+Andrewsx> not really bots but there's definitely a weirdly specific ToS about it so ppl can exploit it

[2023-01-11 12:34:38] <%+Geri_0123> but technically you can't do that while not at your PC (but in fact most are bots)
[2023-01-11 12:34:40] <Kanyusi> @SteelfurLive Guardians do swap if they want to be optimal, especially on Firebrand
[2023-01-11 12:34:41] <+Khellendross> @SteelfurLive most likely, it depends a bit on what type of content you do.
[2023-01-11 12:34:48] <%KelticNight> woy u say Madge

[2023-01-11 12:34:51] <%+DzikiWegorz1223> @SteelfurLive I think all classed needs to do that for optimal dps? But for open world it doesnt matter and guardian is low on complexity

[2023-01-11 12:35:18] <Furtbute> Way to easy for people to be a nuisance
[2023-01-11 12:35:26] <Kanyusi> @Furtbute It's not tho, it's only the base game as an extend trial
[2023-01-11 12:35:31] <+chaosemperordragoneote> gw2 being free allows you to enjoy other games at your own pace
[2023-01-11 12:35:55] <+Khellendross> @SteelfurLive for open world you probably don't need to. There are probably builds where you don't need to swap.

[2023-01-11 12:36:06] <%+Geri_0123> @SteelfurLive In pve ele and engi can't weaponswap in combat. But they have attunements/kits which changes your skills as well

[2023-01-11 12:43:14] <+Khellendross> @SteelfurLive looking at Guardian builds, it looks like Celestrial Firebrand doesn't require you to weaponswap much unless you need the support skills. Your core abilities in the build are all from the axe/torch duel wield skills
[2023-01-11 12:43:14] <%+LuiBMHunter> might as well not a huge cost difference
[2023-01-11 12:43:15] <JaeusA> Remember.  Remember us...

[2023-01-11 12:43:31] <+Tyd4r> No one can guarantee rank 5 415 right now so level 2s with inspiration proc is the only way
[2023-01-11 12:43:51] <%SteelfurLive> But that assumes the person can get high enough that the proc will push it to 418 which is why you need to find a crafter first :D

[2023-01-11 12:55:47] <SykrettsPlays> Honestly, do a public order with 1g commission, and get recraft is you're really unlucky... Ive gotten 405 and 418 from public orders for free by gettin lucky
[2023-01-11 12:55:47] <VipMalis> some 405 also need ilustrious insight to guarntee, so making 405 or 418 is no difference to crafter and would charge 40-50k for that limited resource
[2023-01-11 12:55:49] <%Saint473> 418 without embel would make sense for 30k
[2023-01-11 12:56:06] <%+raynackermann> @notDasar No, hes just doing new FF patch

[2023-01-11 14:29:57] <JaeusA> @Bregan92 Either way 6.4 will probably begin our more direct lead-in to expansion
[2023-01-11 14:30:01] <@%^Streamlabs> Check out our merch! https://preachgaming.com/shop/
[2023-01-11 14:30:02] <%Nifona> @Bregan92 Yoshida said they will start to outline the next expac in 6.4-6.5, so I'm expecting a "meanwhile in...'" after the Golbez fight
[2023-01-11 14:30:06] <%vitsmad> 6.5 has to be the introduction to the new expansion so the void arc has to end in 6.4
[2023-01-11 14:30:07] <+sheevers> @Bregan92 It's probably Golbez that will cause the something big to happen with his death
[2023-01-11 14:30:12] <$crimsondawn12345> GDQ FF7 speedun has begun
[2023-01-11 14:30:15] <ethanlee_33> any knowers how many patches are left till 7.0?
[2023-01-11 14:30:28] <$crimsondawn12345> @ethanlee_33 2 patches

[2023-01-11 14:30:31] <JaeusA> @vitsmad Unless the resolution of this arc directly causes the expansion somehow
[2023-01-11 14:30:32] <+the_mike99907> We usually get the expansion trailer after the x.3 patch no?
[2023-01-11 14:30:35] <%+notlob> don't forget 6.5 gets two story dumps, give extra room to maneuver
[2023-01-11 14:30:35] <jadehito> 1. 7.0 out today Pog
[2023-01-11 14:30:36] <Aerionoth> @ethanlee_33 a year's worth
[2023-01-11 14:30:36] <%KatPiter> Im expecting the First to come into play too, much left open there
[2023-01-11 14:30:38] <%Roctis_> 6.35, 6.4, 6.45, 6.5 and 6.55
[2023-01-11 14:30:41] <edquinox> 6.4 6.5, 7.0 next year
[2023-01-11 14:30:47] <%+BartyBreakerDragon> Tbf, the conclusion to the void could also be the setup for the expansion

[2023-01-11 14:30:48] <Valianttttt> @the_mike99907 fanfest usally i think
[2023-01-11 14:30:49] <%Nifona> @ethanlee_33 2 major, and each patch goes like: x.0, x.1, x3., x.35, x.38
[2023-01-11 14:30:50] <%vitsmad> @JaeusA Thats true, now im confusion :)
[2023-01-11 14:30:52] <$crimsondawn12345> We will get reveal trailer in tokyo fanfest
[2023-01-11 14:30:55] <virtualsoulss> expac trailer will be at fanfest
[2023-01-11 14:30:56] <JaeusA> It's more fair to say 2.5 more patches, since X.55 patches are meaty

[2023-01-11 14:31:44] <+the_mike99907> Isn't tokyo fan fest not until 2024 tho?
[2023-01-11 14:31:45] <%+raynackermann> for fanfest

[2023-01-11 14:41:39] <%phinci> Albion is an alternative name for Great Britain. The oldest attestation of the toponym comes from the Greek language. It is sometimes used poetically and generally to refer to the island, but is less common than 'Britain' today.

[2023-01-11 14:45:30] <%+notlob> you can run off and double pull yourself to add speed/challenge :D
[2023-01-11 14:45:31] <%KatPiter> do it as tank and pull it all
[2023-01-11 14:45:36] <cool2984> They actually hit really hard. It's just that it's all single target so it becomes so slow lol. You can also force pull by yourself if you want
[2023-01-11 14:45:37] <VidulaSaix> I use it so I can go slow. No interest in speedrunning it the first time
[2023-01-11 14:45:44] <%coyote_btw> @frog_89_ that system can go burn in hell
[2023-01-11 14:45:45] <JaeusA> yeah Trust runs take ~26-30min pretty much always
[2023-01-11 14:45:55] <%+Ilovebeingagamer> If it was faster, people wouldn't even queue
[2023-01-11 14:45:57] <angus95a> just pull it for him
[2023-01-11 14:46:05] <radassroach> Trust mode is easiest as WAR, EZ double pulls
[2023-01-11 14:46:08] <%+rudezki> Mike, you can go pulling
[2023-01-11 14:46:09] <%+notlob> if you do trust right it takes 20 mins
[2023-01-11 14:46:10] <%+Vitriol17> I think you cleared the first boss faster than my duty finder pty, feels bad
[2023-01-11 14:46:10] <%LalaBellaLala> there would be no benefit to queueing with actual ppl is my guess if they have decent dps
[2023-01-11 14:46:10] <%+BartyBreakerDragon> Yeah, the DPS goes up if it starts taking too long
[2023-01-11 14:46:12] <+QuestText> all that gear max spiritbonded lol
[2023-01-11 14:46:14] <$KXZ501> Trusts are good for a first run through since it's easier to learn mechanics that way
[2023-01-11 14:46:23] <MushiVG> @Ilovebeingagamer Yes they would, expert roulette still exists
[2023-01-11 14:46:24] <%turtleandfish> trusts are good to learn mechanics
[2023-01-11 14:46:26] <%turtleandfish> imo
[2023-01-11 14:46:28] <JaeusA> @Ilovebeingagamer True if Trusts were too fast, why ever queue with people

[2023-01-11 14:46:37] <Warden120> Mostly just single target
[2023-01-11 14:46:37] <Vermillion129> trust only do single yea
[2023-01-11 14:46:37] <%+BartyBreakerDragon> Yeah, they single target
[2023-01-11 14:46:38] <+auesis> They gain more DPS the longer it goes, so it takes the same time to beat
[2023-01-11 14:46:41] <+SabreMau> Alisaie's limit break is an AoE skill.

[2023-01-11 14:46:53] <%Anganthyr> @VidulaSaix its fine if ppl want to take their time and even with players I have no problem with that but the fights dont have to take forever
[2023-01-11 14:46:54] <JaeusA> they have SOME incidental AOEs sometimes, like Yshtola's Foul

[2023-01-11 14:48:45] <%+Ilovebeingagamer> @MushiVG You need more than just that. Its the reason they made it slow. They KNOW people would rather queue for this if it was faster rather than waiting for a party to find. Its not a replacement. At times throughout the year, DPS queues can already be super long. Imagine if people just did this because it was faster..
