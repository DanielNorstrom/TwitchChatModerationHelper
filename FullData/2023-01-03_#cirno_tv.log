[2023-01-03 00:01:22] <!%biggdeck> kerNana nana~
[2023-01-03 00:01:22] <%CapnDudley> it was a serious problem but companies managed to solve it
[2023-01-03 00:01:24] <%OhIToot> @CapnDudley because it's silly in hindsight
[2023-01-03 00:01:25] <%+masumi_tv> Y2K was an interesting one because a ton of people did have to work together to prevent disaster
[2023-01-03 00:01:26] <@%Toonfish> nothing happened because people actually did prepare for it and made sure everything was safe
[2023-01-03 00:01:26] <%CapnDudley> but since nothing happened
[2023-01-03 00:01:27] <%razorxscooter> Whats that Dudley I'm too young

[2023-01-03 00:01:35] <@%Toonfish> if nobody bothered about y2k it would have been a disaster
[2023-01-03 00:01:36] <%CapnDudley> everyone thought it was all for nothing
[2023-01-03 00:01:36] <%nazzurro> it was very serious

[2023-01-03 00:01:41] <!%kevach> Y2K didn't happen because the people in charge took it seriously

[2023-01-03 00:02:09] <%hat_under_bread> Yes. 32 bit unix timestamps stop working.
[2023-01-03 00:02:12] <%dot_rich> how cum
[2023-01-03 00:02:12] <%CapnDudley> yeah, for 32 bit processors, time can only go up to 3:14 utc on 19 jan 2038
[2023-01-03 00:02:14] <SilverDubloons> Who is your favorite member of the Robot Mafia? Mine's Clamps
[2023-01-03 00:02:18] <%BoSteed> Sure, but it was largely solved way ahead of time, it was never going to be as bad as everyone imagined, and it ended up being a bunch of panic over nothing. That's why. PepeLaugh

[2023-01-03 00:02:24] <@%Toonfish> it's a little bit less of an issue because we have most of the infrastructure to fix it already
[2023-01-03 00:02:31] <%OhIToot> i mean, we have 15 years to prepare
[2023-01-03 00:02:33] <%razorxscooter> Just do it again
[2023-01-03 00:02:33] <%OhIToot> surely we'll be fine COPIUM

What if pickup trucks, previously made for commercial fleets and farmers, could be made accessible to regular average Americans with a need for a utility vehicle with daily driver comforts?

[2023-01-03 00:51:01] <@%^StreamElements> This character has bonus area at low levels, so the rune tracer is huge. It gets stuck on the furniture in this specific spot and covers Cirno's hitbox so he can never get hit. The reaper will spawn with 1.3 million HP because Cirno is at a low level. Before the reaper can attack Cirno picks up the xp to get items and hopefully kill the reaper.  Yes, hyper mode is on.

[2023-01-03 06:09:07] <%kirbydance> seems diablo immortal has a hidden whale “mechanic” when you upgrade a 5/5 star gem to level 10 that is attached to a piece of gear above rank 6 that 5/5 star gem would undergo a process called “awakening” when a 5/5 star gem awakens, it gains an additional 5 slots around it, which allows an additional 5 legendary gems to be slotted into it which the gems have to be individually upgraded again to rank 10.

[2023-01-03 07:29:26] VIEWERS: 655
[2023-01-03 07:29:35] <%Nadie_vt> But for beginners it's better to not open your hand because you can easily get into a situation where you have no yaku if you do

[2023-01-03 20:47:02] <%Strayx> @Cirno_TV When you got your opponent with no Stamina/Health throw them out of the ring give yourself about 3 counts and go out of the ring and beat them up and drag them away from the ring till they hit 10 seconds
[2023-01-03 20:47:02] <%Renolethyn> maybe it's just directional motion not buttons? You totally swapped control when you got pinned lol
