[2023-01-05 02:14:07] <%darkbiacksnow> I googled accord
[2023-01-05 02:14:12] <%darkbiacksnow> all the photos look basic
[2023-01-05 02:14:13] <%darkbiacksnow> KEK
[2023-01-05 02:14:36] <@%hatduck_> its not a basic car, but its not sporty
[2023-01-05 02:14:58] <!%kmzia> tesla car sound so smooth
[2023-01-05 02:15:02] <!%kmzia> the engine

[2023-01-05 02:15:11] <%darkbiacksnow> @WehSing @WehSing 11 minutes ago just pretend we are in accord
[2023-01-05 02:15:17] <@%hatduck_> xddICANT
[2023-01-05 02:15:28] <@%hatduck_> @kmzia yeah coz it has no engine
[2023-01-05 02:15:28] <@%hatduck_> its an EV
[2023-01-05 02:15:33] <@%hatduck_> you'll get the same with any other EV
[2023-01-05 02:15:38] <@%hatduck_> just wait a bit now
[2023-01-05 02:15:45] <!%kmzia> i dont want a loud noisy car
[2023-01-05 02:15:47] <@%hatduck_> coz actual car companies are coming out with EVs now
[2023-01-05 02:15:49] <!%kmzia> i hate it
[2023-01-05 02:15:54] <!%kmzia> when some idiots
[2023-01-05 02:15:57] <!%kmzia> try to show off
[2023-01-05 02:16:01] <!%kmzia> in the middle of the night
[2023-01-05 02:16:05] <@%^Nightbot> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nh9F88weZs
[2023-01-05 02:16:29] <@%hatduck_> teslas have a lot of poor choices imo
[2023-01-05 02:16:34] <@%hatduck_> their build quality is bad
[2023-01-05 02:16:39] <!%kmzia> i went to car showroom the other day
[2023-01-05 02:16:41] <@%hatduck_> and everything inside is a touch button
[2023-01-05 02:16:42] <!%kmzia> they have sample
[2023-01-05 02:16:48] <!%kmzia> for their EV
[2023-01-05 02:16:53] <@%hatduck_> it might seem cool at first
[2023-01-05 02:16:54] <!%kmzia> but i dont remember which brand
[2023-01-05 02:16:59] <%darkbiacksnow> I dont think anybody buys a tesla for a good car
[2023-01-05 02:17:05] <@%hatduck_> but living with a car where everything is a touch button isnt nice
[2023-01-05 02:17:12] <@%hatduck_> coz u cant drive along and change things
[2023-01-05 02:17:24] <@%hatduck_> u have to look down where on the screen ur touching to change things
[2023-01-05 02:17:32] <@%hatduck_> like even the AC is controlled from the screen
[2023-01-05 02:17:42] <@%hatduck_> u cant just press a button and turn on AC
[2023-01-05 02:17:51] <@%hatduck_> u cant even change the direction of the AC vents manually
[2023-01-05 02:17:58] <@%hatduck_> u have to do that from the touchscreen as well
[2023-01-05 02:17:59] <@%Cetkaman> i remember when one of my friends who is into cars got started on electric cars PepeLaf
[2023-01-05 02:18:56] <@%Cetkaman> i dont even know what set him off but he went on a 30 minute monologe how everyone who bought "electric" cars from big brands a few years ago is stupid cuz its not real electric yet
[2023-01-05 02:19:17] <@%Cetkaman> just a basic car with a modified engine slapped into it xdd
[2023-01-05 02:19:36] <@%hatduck_> what does he mean by not real electric yet
[2023-01-05 02:19:40] <@%hatduck_> so Nissan Leaf wasnt a real electric
[2023-01-05 02:19:47] <@%hatduck_> only Tesla made first real electric?
[2023-01-05 02:19:49] <%Shootles> he's a big oil stooge
[2023-01-05 02:19:50] <@%Cetkaman> i dont remember
[2023-01-05 02:19:52] <@%hatduck_> so delusional
[2023-01-05 02:20:00] <@%Cetkaman> nah he hates tesla
[2023-01-05 02:20:31] <@%Cetkaman> i cant remember the exact reasoning
[2023-01-05 02:20:37] <%Shootles> i'm betting he's a hydro lover
[2023-01-05 02:20:45] <%Shootles> and hates the wall powered battery cares
[2023-01-05 02:20:46] <%darkbiacksnow> hydro homie HYDRATE
[2023-01-05 02:20:47] <%Shootles> car*
[2023-01-05 02:21:17] <%Shootles> hydrogen**
[2023-01-05 02:21:20] <@%Cetkaman> he does not have a problem with electric cars
[2023-01-05 02:21:34] <@%Cetkaman> it was something about the build not being optimized for them
[2023-01-05 02:21:42] <@%hatduck_> @kmzia check the Hyundai Ioniq 5 or the Kia EV6 okey
[2023-01-05 02:21:50] <@%hatduck_> they're really good EVs
[2023-01-05 02:21:52] <%Shootles> hmmMeeting
[2023-01-05 02:22:01] <@%Cetkaman> but cant remember well, i was just surprised how passionate he was about it PepeLaf
[2023-01-05 02:22:21] <%Shootles> weebGiggles
[2023-01-05 02:22:26] <@%hatduck_> a lot of hardcore car nerds dont like electric
[2023-01-05 02:22:32] <@%hatduck_> coz its not a "real" car etc
[2023-01-05 02:22:59] <%Shootles> they're just stupid dinosaurs
[2023-01-05 02:23:01] <@%Cetkaman> hatduck_, you need to factor in that my country is a shithole so newer models arrive slower
[2023-01-05 02:23:12] <%Shootles> like people were all like "real men ride horses" pre-care
[2023-01-05 02:23:14] <%Shootles> car*
[2023-01-05 02:23:22] <@%hatduck_> @Shootles PepeLaf
[2023-01-05 02:23:39] <@%hatduck_> @Cetkaman EVs by international brands are too expensive for my country
[2023-01-05 02:23:45] <@%hatduck_> nothing is affordable
[2023-01-05 02:23:54] <@%hatduck_> so Tata has made some
[2023-01-05 02:24:03] <@%hatduck_> and they're doing quite well
[2023-01-05 02:24:12] <@%hatduck_> i see Tata EVs on the road frequently
[2023-01-05 02:24:17] <@%Cetkaman> i think he had a problem with models that just swithced the benzin engine to EV-s without optimizing the structure
[2023-01-05 02:24:30] <@%hatduck_> theres even a new cab service in my city that uses only Tata EVs, and they're cheaper than Uber
[2023-01-05 02:24:40] <@%Cetkaman> but im not a car nerd so Shrugeg idk if that even happened
[2023-01-05 02:24:43] <@%hatduck_> benzine engine Susge
[2023-01-05 02:24:46] <Phant0mBlades> hatduck_, if you dont mind me asking, are you from New Delhi FeelsDankMan
[2023-01-05 02:24:48] <%Shootles> the main issue for EV is infastructure
[2023-01-05 02:24:48] <@%hatduck_> what are you saying lol
[2023-01-05 02:24:51] <@%hatduck_> @Phant0mBlades Kol
[2023-01-05 02:24:58] <Phant0mBlades> ohh FeelsDankMan
[2023-01-05 02:25:00] <@%Cetkaman> its
[2023-01-05 02:25:08] <@%Cetkaman> not benzin in english is it PepeLaf
[2023-01-05 02:25:10] <%Shootles> living in a condo you can't just charge it overnight
[2023-01-05 02:25:13] <@%Cetkaman> yeah its petrol
[2023-01-05 02:25:17] <@%hatduck_> @Cetkaman no he's not exactly right about all that
[2023-01-05 02:25:17] <@%Cetkaman> Pepege
[2023-01-05 02:25:25] <@%hatduck_> for some cars yes
[2023-01-05 02:25:37] <Phant0mBlades> I visited Kolkata like 15 years ago Aware
[2023-01-05 02:25:46] <@%hatduck_> there are some cars that the manufacturers just converted from ICE to Electric
[2023-01-05 02:25:57] <@%hatduck_> he's kinda right about those
[2023-01-05 02:26:03] <%Shootles> ice?
[2023-01-05 02:26:10] <@%hatduck_> Internal Combustion Engine
[2023-01-05 02:26:13] <@%hatduck_> the problem with those is
[2023-01-05 02:26:14] <%Shootles> ooh
[2023-01-05 02:26:22] <@%hatduck_> those are not designed with a place to store the batteries
[2023-01-05 02:26:29] <%Shootles> true
[2023-01-05 02:26:38] <%Shootles> them batteries are heavy bastards
[2023-01-05 02:26:38] <@%hatduck_> you see, in cars that are designed from the start to be an EV, the floor is where the batteries are placed
[2023-01-05 02:26:58] <%Shootles> batteries are stil so dangerous though
[2023-01-05 02:27:10] <%Shootles> they don't fail often, but when they do it very sudden for no reason and super scary
[2023-01-05 02:27:18] <@%hatduck_> yeah
[2023-01-05 02:27:31] <@%hatduck_> i saw a video recently of some parked electric busses in china
[2023-01-05 02:27:36] <%Shootles> yeeea i saw that too
[2023-01-05 02:27:37] <@%hatduck_> one combusts randomly
[2023-01-05 02:27:44] <%Shootles> as it slowly ate each bus one after another
[2023-01-05 02:27:46] <@%hatduck_> and the nearby ones chain combust
[2023-01-05 02:27:46] <%Shootles> lol
[2023-01-05 02:27:56] <%Shootles> i mean no one would know what to do
[2023-01-05 02:28:03] <%Shootles> you can't just hose down a battery fire
[2023-01-05 02:28:16] <%Shootles> i assume it's a foam or CO2 thing
[2023-01-05 02:28:20] <%Shootles> water i assume would make it all worse
[2023-01-05 02:28:59] <@%Cetkaman> just pour water on electric fires, whats the worst that could happen Clueless
[2023-01-05 02:29:09] <%Shootles> So, how do you choose the right fire extinguisher in this scenario? Lithium-ion batteries are considered a Class B fire, so a standard ABC or dry chemical fire extinguisher should be used. Class B is the classification given to flammable liquids. Lithium-ion batteries contain liquid electrolytes that provide a conductive pathway, so the batteries receive a Class B fire classification.
[2023-01-05 02:29:15] <%Shootles> ye it's the poweder method
[2023-01-05 02:29:48] <%Shootles> wait.
[2023-01-05 02:29:51] <@%hatduck_> Hmm
[2023-01-05 02:29:52] <%Shootles> i misread, not powder
[2023-01-05 02:31:39] <@%hatduck_> oh yeah theres also the thing
[2023-01-05 02:31:46] <%Shootles> @darkbiacksnow, https://twitter.com/Suikoden/status/1610779184909123584 PauseChamp
[2023-01-05 02:31:47] <@%hatduck_> about batteries being packed in cells
[2023-01-05 02:32:04] <@%hatduck_> so even if u put one out, the nearby cells can still be hot enough
[2023-01-05 02:32:04] <@%hatduck_> and combust later
[2023-01-05 02:32:21] <@%hatduck_> i remember reading about the crash Richard Hammond had in a Rimac prototype

[2023-01-05 02:32:56] <%darkbiacksnow> ICANT
[2023-01-05 02:32:57] <%Shootles> also if you pinch the cells a bit, they can still short later
[2023-01-05 02:33:15] <%Shootles> like the Samsung Note 7 issues

[2023-01-05 02:34:50] <%Shootles> so much time spent running back and forth waiting for them to show up in your party
[2023-01-05 02:35:03] <%Shootles> they're not in the 108 so they can be skipped
[2023-01-05 02:35:26] <%darkbiacksnow> I catch all of them
[2023-01-05 02:35:32] <%darkbiacksnow> but I never actually used them

[2023-01-05 08:29:17] <benedict___> manwha is just the basics of shonen. less philosophy and more fight. it's just the dumb version of manga
[2023-01-05 08:29:20] <hayn_e> LN titles WECANT
[2023-01-05 08:29:21] <%darkbiacksnow> they try to at least give it a proper title

[2023-01-05 14:39:35] <@%$wTone_> Bocchi is literally me. No other character can come close to relating to me like her. There is no way you can convince me that I’m not Bocchi. Bocchi could not possibly be any more me. It’s me, and nobody can convince me otherwise. If anyone approached me about this not possibly being me, I immediately shut them down with overwhelming evidence that Bocchi was me. Bocchi is absolutely me; it is indisputable.

[2023-01-05 14:40:11] <%ZuraNotZura> blademail would be good against lina, her projectiles are slow but attack speed is high, so you could reflect back a lot of dmg before she changes target
[2023-01-05 14:40:12] <%Kwzprtt> @wTone_ WHOMEGALUL ?
[2023-01-05 14:40:15] <@%$wTone_> Why anyone would try to argue that Bocchi is not me is beyond me. If you held two pictures of me and Bocchi side by side, you’d see no difference. I can safely look at Bocchi every day and say, “Yup, she’s me.” I can practically see Bocchi whenever I look at myself in the mirror. I go outside, and people stop me from commenting on how similar I look and act as Bocchi is. I chuckle softly as I’m assured every day Bocchi is me in every way.

[2023-01-05 14:40:32] <@%$wTone_> I can smile each time I get out of bed each morning, knowing that I’ve found my identity with Bocchi and I know my place in this world. It’s amusing how similar she is to me; it’s almost like identical twins. When I first saw Bocchi, I had an existential crisis. What it Bocchi was the real me and I was the fictional being? What if she actually became aware of my existence? Did she have the ability to become self-aware?

[2023-01-05 16:11:39] <xexsxexs> It's 7pm and I just got home from work, my wife is not at home because she is staying the night over at her boyfriend's place. Tired and exhausted I open my laptop and go to twitch to watch singsing play dota. I notice he is in a game and I decide to ask "is this ranked?", but the whole chat starts spamming this stupid PepegaPhone emote instead of answering my question. Fuck you chat and mods, you just lost another loyal viewer and chatter.
