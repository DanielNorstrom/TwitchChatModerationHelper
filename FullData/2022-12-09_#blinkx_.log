[2022-12-09 16:18:20] <+jim_sef> Did beef welly taste like tuna?
[2022-12-09 16:18:21] <%dabbasaurus19> its the mix of stuff around the beef then wrapped
[2022-12-09 16:18:30] <%+Cwarner312> also getting the pastry wrapped tightly with right ratio so it cooks evenly on all sides
[2022-12-09 16:18:31] <Anacott> but doesn't that make you miss out of things or is this around people you don't really care about their opinion?
[2022-12-09 16:18:38] <%BruTaL_BeN> Can we get a beef welly supercut
[2022-12-09 16:18:43] <@%heavymetalrules> meat is not easy though
[2022-12-09 16:18:56] <@%heavymetalrules> do a stream making one if you think that
[2022-12-09 16:18:58] <thegoodherald> Friend of mine works in the reality TV industry, had a really interesting observation. Data show that American viewers like to see "exceptional" people live mundane lives/day-to-day (Kardashians etc.) where UK like seeing "normal" people do exceptional things (Great British Bakeoff)

[2022-12-09 16:57:58] <hva_er_jeg> can we do a little roleplay? Say I'm a bouncer, 6'8 400 lbs pure muscle, and you're a 4'11 girl who is wearing a bright pink dress going down to about halfway to your knees. You give me you're ID, what does it sya next to "Date of Birth?"
[2022-12-09 16:57:59] <maaw89> Depends on what's more important to you being yourself or other things
