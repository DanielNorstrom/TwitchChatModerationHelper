[2023-01-10 16:51:30] <%Crossfire_XCI> they make enough money to not have to be spread so thin though

[2023-01-10 16:51:36] <%kablmao> they ask for your input before they release the game, ignore you, and then continue to ignore you once released

[2023-01-10 16:51:41] <%+jduve73> played warzone 1 like 8hrs a day, play this less than 8hrs a week its so bad
[2023-01-10 16:51:41] <jekub_b> Pubg is not a casual gane
[2023-01-10 16:51:42] <%dseres25> whats the first give away you pick up on that makes you know someone is cheating
[2023-01-10 16:51:43] <%catsby16> do other games have server issues?
[2023-01-10 16:51:44] <+brokeoff0814> Def ruined the experience. I didn’t like caldera so I played rebirth and really enjoyed it. I’m very average but feel this game would be 100% better if they kept it the same with this new map. It would be killing it.
[2023-01-10 16:51:44] <IIBASSIl> I’ve been playing god of war lately instead. A lot of fun and a good switch up when this game makes me mad.

[2023-01-10 18:17:52] <jnasty_warzone> btw, legit, y'all have no clue just how many people are 'softcore' cheating with lower aimlock settings, walls only, etc. it's very prevalent
