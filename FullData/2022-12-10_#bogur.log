[2022-12-10 11:22:01] <+zQtko> Even in low ranks, I don't personally have fun in gold/plat. The matchmaking still feels like I either get steamrolled or we steamroll them, which is boring I'd rather close games which is fun
[2022-12-10 11:22:07] <%javelight> at least give the option to see ur sr when ur gm5

[2022-12-10 11:24:51] <amazing_mia> didnt they derank everyone with the new season
[2022-12-10 11:25:02] <@%+Zenxis> @amazing_mia Yes
[2022-12-10 11:25:28] <amazing_mia> why would they do that but no do a mmr reset
[2022-12-10 11:25:41] <%katmosk> thats like season 1 system

[2022-12-10 11:26:32] <amazing_mia> but comp isnt meant to be casual thats what unranked is for
[2022-12-10 11:26:37] <amazing_mia> ;-;
[2022-12-10 11:27:01] <%Waizer> qp caters to casual gameplay, why make comp for casual gameplay too? I'm not even including arcade in this aswell
[2022-12-10 11:27:17] <%katmosk> yeah like if a casual gets more interested and tries rank and keeps playing it he'll realize its shit and quit
[2022-12-10 11:27:24] <jujuondabeatyuh> The rank reset after every season sucks too
[2022-12-10 11:27:36] <%katmosk> like u turn casuals into tryhards not tryhards into causals
[2022-12-10 11:27:38] <someoneguideme> I've heard someone say overwatch being a casual game that tries to be compettive
[2022-12-10 11:27:40] <+ThemApplesDood> kinda feels like they took the ow1 players who want to try and just farted in their faces
[2022-12-10 11:27:54] <%Waizer> @katmosk I love this, sums up my thoughts perfectly

[2022-12-10 11:28:35] <%javelight> if they give you the option to see SR then it would be great
[2022-12-10 11:28:55] <+ThemApplesDood> I just want to love the game again 😔
[2022-12-10 11:29:23] <%Waizer> every streamer is gunna end up like dafran and just do a 48hour stream of OW1 games
[2022-12-10 11:29:37] <+ThemApplesDood> catering to casuals and spenders
[2022-12-10 11:29:40] <raaikuun> @Waizer LUL LUL LUL
[2022-12-10 11:29:53] <mobibig> but it has been shown time and time again that this approach doesnt work. why do they keep doing this

[2022-12-10 11:30:40] <chadsupergamers> Casual aren’t playing competitive maybe like placements for a few comp points but that’s it
[2022-12-10 11:30:44] <@%+Zenxis> Can you buy OW1 still? What if you buy that and the acct with all the OW1 skins LULW
[2022-12-10 11:30:51] <%ChrisTheRookey> Now with F2P, the hardcore community is smaller, but spends more money. Among the casuals, there are tons of ppl who would never spend a dime.
[2022-12-10 11:31:44] <%javelight> do most ow players even play competitive? would be interesting to see the numbers
[2022-12-10 11:31:55] <urDasHole> they want battle pass sales as a priority no?

[2022-12-10 11:32:24] <scepticsm> @bogur is ramatra worth it
[2022-12-10 11:32:30] <jujuondabeatyuh> I got some of my friends to try out overwatch and they only play quick play and arcade
[2022-12-10 11:32:43] <chadsupergamers> The battlepass themes that have maybe 2-3 of the skins in bp but the rest are in shop is terrible
[2022-12-10 11:32:44] <%ChrisTheRookey> QP and arcade exist for a reason. Competitive is about becoming the best and ranking up. There is no casual thought. It's not what the mode is designed for.
[2022-12-10 11:32:48] <rookieh3re> we need more support players I'm Gold 5 and i'm being put in diamond lobbies

[2022-12-10 11:36:33] <funnynumber420> it's also stupid because you aren't likely to get skins for the heroes you like unless they are in the battlepass

[2022-12-10 11:41:16] <smokeys0uls> @oldspicebodywash nah
[2022-12-10 11:41:16] <urDasHole> the matchmaking makes comp more toxic in low ranks
[2022-12-10 11:41:16] <oldspicebodywash> qp sucks imo because there tends to be more leavers

[2022-12-10 11:52:32] <%ChrisTheRookey> I mean, in Germany we have Gronkh who is in his mid 40s and he still has 20k viewers. And he will for sure stream into his 50s.
[2022-12-10 11:52:32] <De_anner> it also more like the path you lay down to what you can do after you are to old, like ex pros that become coaches
[2022-12-10 11:52:51] <skunky4x> Well sure, but the majority of people who play video games are like 15-30 yr olds so they watch people they can relate to
[2022-12-10 11:53:04] <jujuondabeatyuh> Or you can build a super big fan base like pewdiepie and then just do whatever you want
[2022-12-10 11:53:29] <%N7Furyy> pewdiepie is the exception
[2022-12-10 11:53:34] <De_anner> there you have the solution just build a fanbase like pewdiepie^^

[2022-12-10 11:54:24] <sometimes_spencer> You just keep adjusting what you do to match what you enjoy and you’ll find an audience base that enjoy that too
[2022-12-10 11:54:32] <%Waizer> if you've managed to make it as a streamer I refuse to believe you would be so lazy as to not evolve your brand/image as you age to stay relevant

[2022-12-10 16:20:43] <%+M0ns4i> If they see your name in recommended and you play variety, but they have ow streamers they can watch, then they will watch overwatch streams. If there aren't any online, they might be like "yeah, I know this guy, let's check him out"
[2022-12-10 16:20:53] <@%+Zenxis> @Jameizi Yeah I gave that up probably when I started watching bogur
