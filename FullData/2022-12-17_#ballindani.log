[2022-12-17 18:02:10] <NewJayPlus> hog is silly rn
[2022-12-17 18:02:34] <@%ratprime66> Hog so goofy
[2022-12-17 18:02:38] <lilyie_ow> I mean tbf you can do pretty well on ball by grappling and slamming off cooldown if they have no cc
[2022-12-17 18:03:19] <Peurre> @lilyie_ow yeah but youd get more value punching as doom, or bubbling with winston, hes the worst dive tank by an INSANE margin
[2022-12-17 18:03:24] <lilyie_ow> I'm not top 500 tho so I don't have to deal with that

[2022-12-17 18:04:59] <%$dankpips45> it's sad cause ball is fun af to play. But devs were like "remove efficacy to compensate for fun" it feels like.
[2022-12-17 18:05:12] <lilyie_ow> hog is tearing our family apart
[2022-12-17 18:05:50] <NewJayPlus> inb4 they make it so you can only grapple specific geometry to make it easier for casuals to play ball
[2022-12-17 18:06:04] <lilyie_ow> I think what ball needs is more shield buffs

[2022-12-17 18:07:38] <Peurre> I think best for ball is slight more damage on fireball and slam, with small decreases to cooldowns
